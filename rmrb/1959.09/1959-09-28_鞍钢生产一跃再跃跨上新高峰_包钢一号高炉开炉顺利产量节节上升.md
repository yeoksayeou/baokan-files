Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 27th. Our correspondent Sun Minghui reports: On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, Anshan Iron and Steel's production has achieved great victories one after another. In the past week, the production level of major products such as steel, iron, and steel materials has reached new peaks. According to relevant statistics, from the 20th to the 25th, steel production exceeded the plan by more than 1,400 tons per day, iron production exceeded the plan by more than 110 tons per day, and steel material production exceeded the plan by more than 1,980 tons per day. The quality of various products is also continuously improving.

Entering September, on the basis of opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging vigorous efforts, Anshan Iron and Steel's production is like a swift horse running a thousand miles a day, galloping on the track of progress, and new production records are repeatedly refreshed. In early September, the daily output of steel and iron increased by 3.1% and 1.9% respectively compared with late August. If the large-scale repairs are excluded, the output of steel materials also increased significantly compared with late August. In mid-September, the output of steel, iron, and steel materials increased by 1.2%, 6.6%, and 15.9% respectively compared with early September. Since late September, the output of various major products has continued to increase. From September 1st to 25th, there were seven new daily production records for steel and iron production alone. What is particularly prominent is that since late September, the daily output of major products such as steel, iron, and steel materials has generally been consolidated at or close to the level of the new record. This is a new situation on the Anshan Iron and Steel production front. It greatly encourages the confidence of the vast number of workers to complete this year's Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule.

The continuous victories in Anshan Iron and Steel's production are a direct result of opposing right-leaning tendencies, encouraging vigorous efforts, and vigorously carrying out mass movements, and are the great crystallization of the surging political enthusiasm of the workers. Since July, after criticizing right-leaning thoughts and achieving major victories in production, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel have always regarded the Party Central Committee's call for opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging vigorous efforts as a sharp weapon to promote production, constantly criticizing the repeatedly emerging right-leaning conservative thoughts, boosting revolutionary vigor, and repeatedly proposing new production targets.

After proposing new leap-forward targets, the workers of various factories and mines widely carried out technical performance competitions. The technical operation level of the workers was rapidly improved, many long-unresolved production key issues were quickly resolved, and the technical innovation movement also flourished. The workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, whose production plan was not as good as other units in August, have been vigorously carrying out technical performance competitions since the beginning of September. Everyone is striving to be the best, and everyone is showing their talents. They have successively solved a series of key production issues such as furnace protection and ingot casting, enabling the plant to produce 6,043 tons of steel more than the state plan from the 1st to the 25th, and the average daily output increased by 14.6% compared with August, catching up to the front. The workers of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces, who pioneered the advanced experience of technical performance competitions, have recently summarized and promoted more than 20 major advanced technical experiences through performances. Among them, the experience of changing the steel outlet has shortened the time of changing the steel outlet from the original one or two hours to a few minutes after promotion. Since September, the entire plant has increased the production of high-quality steel by more than 4,400 tons.

Since September, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee have tightened their grip on production. In addition to regularly studying and inspecting production, the secretaries of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee have also assigned themselves to factories and mines to assist factory and mine cadres in solving production problems. Under the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee, leading cadres of various factories and mines have gone deep into the front line to focus on production, and many leading cadres have also taken the lead in participating in technical performances, promoting the in-depth development of technical performance competitions.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 21st. The opening of the No. 1 large blast furnace of Baotou Iron and Steel Company was very smooth, and the iron production increased time after time.

After the furnace was opened at 5:55 a.m. on the 26th, five furnaces of molten iron were produced in one day, producing a total of 384 tons of iron, and most of them were qualified iron. From the 27th to 2:37 p.m., when our reporter sent the manuscript from Baotou Steel, another four furnaces were produced, producing a total of more than 460 tons, and the last two furnaces were both above 150 tons per furnace. The material feeding per hour increased from two or three batches to six batches. Jin Xin, deputy director of production of the Ironmaking Plant, told our reporter: "The opening of the No. 1 blast furnace is going very smoothly. Two more furnaces of molten iron will be produced tonight, and the daily output can be increased by nearly double compared with the 26th." The old furnace workers from Anshan Iron and Steel said that it was rare for him to see such a smooth opening of a large blast furnace in the past.

The furnace workers of Baotou Steel's Ironmaking Plant are very motivated. In order to welcome the National Day, they have been fighting day and night in front of the blast furnace these two days, studying to improve smelting technology, and determined to gradually achieve high production and high quality on the basis of the smooth opening of the furnace. The employee representatives of the Ironmaking Plant stated at the iron production celebration meeting on the 26th that they would over fulfill the state's iron production plan for this year by 30% by the end of the year.

    鞍钢生产一跃再跃跨上新高峰
    包钢一号高炉开炉顺利产量节节上升
    据新华社鞍山27日电　本社记者孙铭惠报道：建国十周年前夕，鞍钢的生产节节获得巨大胜利，最近一周来，钢、铁、钢材等主要产品的生产水平都达到了新的高峰。据有关方面统计，20日到25日，钢每天比计划多产一千四百多吨，铁每天比计划多产一百一十吨，钢材每天比计划多产一千九百八十多吨。各项产品的质量也不断提高。
    进入9月份，在反右倾、鼓干劲的基础上，鞍钢的生产犹如日行千里的骏马，在前进的跑道上疾驰飞奔，生产新纪录一再刷新。9月上旬钢和铁的日产量比8月下旬分别提高3.1％和1.9％，钢材的产量如剔除大修的因素以外也比8月下旬有很大提高；中旬钢、铁、钢材产量又分别比上旬提高1.2％、6.6％、15.9％；下旬以来各项主要产品的产量又继续提高。从9月1日到25日，仅是钢和铁的生产，就出现了七次日产新纪录。特别突出的是从下旬以来，钢、铁和钢材等主要产品的日产量一般都巩固在或接近于新纪录的水平，这是鞍钢生产战线上的新的形势，它大大鼓舞了广大职工提前完成今年大跃进计划的信心。
    鞍钢生产不断获得胜利，是反右倾、鼓干劲和大搞群众运动的直接成果，是职工们政治热情澎湃高涨的伟大结晶。从7月份以来，鞍钢的职工们在批判了右倾思想、生产上获得重大胜利之后，就一直把党中央反右倾、鼓干劲的号召，作为推进生产的一个锐利的武器，不断批判了一再露头的右倾保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，一次又一次地提出新的生产指标。
    在提出新的跃进指标以后，各厂矿职工广泛开展了技术表演赛，工人的技术操作水平迅速提高，许多长期没有解决的生产关键很快得到解决，技术革新运动也随之蓬勃地开展起来。8月份生产计划完成得没有别的单位好的第一炼钢厂职工，从9月初大力开展技术表演赛以来，人人争上游，个个逞英豪，先后解决了炼钢护炉、铸锭等方面的一系列的生产关键问题，使1日到25日比国家计划多产钢六千零四十三吨，平均日产量比8月份提高了14.6％，赶到了前面。首创技术表演赛这一先进经验的五座大型固定式平炉的职工，最近通过表演已总结和推广了二十多项重大的先进技术经验，其中换出钢口的经验推广后，使换出钢口的时间从原来的一、两个小时缩短到几分钟。全厂9月份以来已增产优质钢四千四百多吨。
    9月份以来，中共鞍山市委和鞍钢党委对生产抓得更紧了。除了经常研究和检查生产以外，鞍山市委和鞍钢党委的书记们都分工下厂下矿协同厂矿干部解决生产中的问题。在中共鞍山市委和鞍钢党委的领导下，各厂矿领导干部都深入现场狠抓生产，许多领导干部还带头参加技术表演，推动了技术表演赛的深入开展。
    新华社包头21日电　包头钢铁公司一号大型高炉开炉很顺利，产铁量一次比一次增多。
    26日晨五时五十五分开炉后，一天内出了五炉铁水，共产生铁三百八十四吨，而且多是合格铁。27日到下午二时三十七分本社记者在包钢发稿时为止，又出了四炉，共产四百六十多吨，最后两炉每炉都在一百五十吨以上。每小时下料，由二、三批提高到六批。炼铁厂生产副厂长金心对本社记者说：“一号高炉开炉情况非常顺利。今天晚上还要出两炉铁水，日产量可比26日增加将近一倍。”从鞍钢来的老炉前工说，大型高炉开炉这样顺利，是他过去很少看到的。
    包钢炼铁厂的炉前工人干劲很足。为了迎接国庆节，这两天他们昼夜奋战在高炉前，研究提高冶炼技术，决心使高炉在顺利开炉的基础上，逐步做到高产优质。炼铁厂的职工代表在26日的出铁庆祝大会上表示：到年底要超额30％完成今年的生铁生产国家计划。
