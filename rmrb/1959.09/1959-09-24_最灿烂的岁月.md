    The Most Brilliant Years

    Listen! The great leap forward surges like ten thousand horses galloping; look! Victory flowers are blooming everywhere. These are the rich fruits yielded by revolutionary vigor, the fireworks set off by workers in various places to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

    It is impossible for hostile elements at home and abroad to dream of negating the achievements of our Great Leap Forward. Jiangxi has more than thirty key projects to be completed by the end of the month; Henan Province averages one important capital construction project being handed over for production every day. I ask you, which state in the United States today has such a miracle?

    It is also doomed to failure for right-leaning opportunists to attempt to cover the sky with one hand and spread pessimism and disappointment. Our socialist construction is unprecedented and advancing by leaps and bounds. The situation is getting better and better, and there are more and more favorable conditions. We are facing the most brilliant years. The resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party shine even more brightly on the socialist future of our country. The Party's call to "complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year" is increasingly becoming a reality. Let us hold high the banner of victory and advance in leaps and bounds!

    最灿烂的岁月
    听！跃进波涛万马奔腾；看！胜利鲜花到处开放。这是革命干劲结出的硕果，是各地职工放出的迎接建国十周年的礼花。
    国内外敌对分子梦想否定我们大跃进的成绩是不行的。江西有三十几项重点工程，要在月底竣工；河南省平均每天就有一项重要基建工程移交生产。试问现在的美国有哪一个州有这种奇迹？
    右倾机会主义者企图一手遮天，散布悲观失望情绪，也是要碰钉子的。我们的社会主义建设震古灼今，突飞猛进，形势越来越好，有利条件越来越多。我们正面临着最灿烂的岁月。党的八中全会的决议把我国的社会主义前途照耀得更加明亮。党所提出的“在今年完成第二个五年计划主要指标”的号召正在日益变成现实。让我们高举胜利的旗帜，高歌猛进！
