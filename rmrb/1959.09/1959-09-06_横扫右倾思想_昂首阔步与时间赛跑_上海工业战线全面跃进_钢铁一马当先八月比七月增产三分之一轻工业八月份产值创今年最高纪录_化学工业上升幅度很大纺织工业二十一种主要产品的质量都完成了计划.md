(Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 5th) High output, high quality, and comprehensive advancement in conservation, veterans and new recruits progressing side by side, cadres, workers, and technicians advancing with one heart—these are the distinct characteristics of the new high tide in the increase production and conservation movement in Shanghai over the past month. Over the past month or so, the Party's call to "oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and launch the increase production and conservation movement" has ignited the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers; the publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has pushed this movement to a new peak. Factories throughout the city have successively convened mass meetings, determined to work hard and forge ahead resolutely to achieve the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year. The steel industry is taking the lead. Shanghai's steel production in August set a new record for the year, an increase of 33% compared to July and a 1.4-fold increase compared to August last year. In particular, the daily output on August 29th and 31st reached 7,438 tons and 7,314 tons respectively. In the first three days of September, despite the overhaul of many furnaces, it still increased by 19% compared to the same period in August. August was also the month with the highest output value for light industry this year, with the output value in the last ten days of the month almost doubling compared to the first ten days. The output value of the chemical industry also increased significantly, with an increase of 39% in the middle ten days compared to the first ten days, and an increase of 42% in the last ten days compared to the middle ten days. Although the textile industry was affected by the power supply, the output value in August still increased by 3.7% compared to July, exceeding the plan. Not only are the output and output value high in various industries, but also the quality is good, the variety is diverse, and the achievements in conservation are great. Taking the textile industry as an example, the quality of twenty-one major products fully met the August plan, which is unprecedented in history. Among the forty-plus cotton textile factories, thirty-five factories achieved a 100% standard product rate for cotton yarn. The city saved a total of 150,000 tons of coal and more than 12,000 tons of petroleum in July and August.

    The broad masses of workers have recognized the situation and are striding forward to race against time. In recent days, new records, new technologies, and new products have emerged one after another, and many new projects have been completed successively. A few factories have already completed their annual output value plans ahead of schedule; and more factories have proposed to complete their annual plans before National Day. The Shanghai Boiler Factory, Shanghai Turbine Factory, and Shanghai Motor Factory, which are famous for jointly producing complete sets of power generation equipment, have raised their annual targets from around 650,000 kilowatts to 780,000 to 910,000 kilowatts respectively, accounting for more than half of the national 1962 target stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan. On August 24th, only thirty-five young workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory had completed their annual workload ahead of schedule, but by August 31st, one hundred and seventeen had completed their annual workload ahead of schedule and entered 1960. Exciting good news has spread everywhere: China's first three-coil 220,000-volt high-voltage, 30,000 kVA giant transformer has been successfully trial-produced, towering two stories high and weighing 135 tons; China's first highly precise twelve-roller strip steel cold rolling mill has also been successfully trial-produced, with a roller surface smoother than a mirror. Newly built projects such as a large-scale electric furnace steelmaking workshop and a modern cement plant have also been completed successively.

    The Party's instructions have armed the minds of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, and they have risen up to sweep away complacency, conservatism, and the sentiment of shrinking back in the face of difficulties. In the past, some people at the Anda No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory opposed accelerating the speed of the machines, believing that high speed could not achieve high quality, low consumption, and low yarn breakage rate. However, the workers answered them with excellent results in fully completing the plan in the second quarter. When the factory proposed to further accelerate the machine speed and reduce the yarn breakage rate in the third quarter, they came out again and said: "This is bragging!" "You can only pick one between fish and bear's paw; don't try to do too much and end up with nothing." In response to this thinking, the Party committee promptly and deeply carried out ideological criticism. The competition among workers throughout the factory was in full swing. As a result, the plan was fully completed again in August, with output increasing by 10% compared to July, the standard cotton yarn rate reaching 100%, and the average yarn breakage rate only around ninety-two. Those who initially poured cold water on the idea had to privately say to others: "It seems that mobilizing the masses is reasonable!" The Far East Clock Factory was rated as an advanced factory in the same industry in the first half of the year, but some cadres became complacent as a result, and relaxed their leadership over the current production, resulting in the failure to complete the output and quality plans in July. After studying the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-leaning Emotions and Vigorously Promote Production and Conservation," the leading cadres re-armed their minds, made self-criticisms to the masses, and went to the front line with the masses to analyze the internal and external situation of the factory, and found the key to the current production—reducing the in-house repair rate. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses was quickly boosted, and within a few days, each group identified more than one hundred problems and took concrete measures to address these problems. The in-house repair rate of products immediately dropped by nearly half. Both the output and quality plans were completed in August.

    The advanced units and workers have become more advanced, and the backward units and workers have also quickly caught up. The open-hearth furnace of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant is a national high-yield red flag. In July, they ranked first in the country with a utilization coefficient of 13.2, and in August, it rose to 15.1. The workers of the seven factories, including the State-owned Cotton No. 2 Factory and the State-owned Cotton No. 1 Factory, which were rated as excellent factories in the city's cotton textile industry in the first half of the year, gained new momentum from the Party's instructions on "opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and launching the increase production and conservation movement." In August, they continued to stand in the forefront of the entire industry in terms of unit output level, quality, and conservation. The Da Guangming Clock Factory was originally a relatively backward factory in the clock and watch industry, and had failed to complete its plan for four months. In August, the workers throughout the factory boosted their morale and strived to catch up, and production gradually increased, exceeding the target for the entire month.

    There are two sulfuric acid factories in the chemical industry: one is the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory, which has been in operation for more than eighty years; and the other is the Shanghai Sulfuric Acid Factory, which was built after the Great Leap Forward last year. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory rejuvenated the old factory, and its output increased thirty times compared to when it was first built. This year, they continued to do everything possible to tap the potential of the equipment, striving to increase the output to fifty times that of when it was first built. The design capacity of the Shanghai Sulfuric Acid Factory is 150 tons per day, but the new factory, new people, and new equipment faced many technical difficulties, and it was not until August 25th that it reached a daily output of 136 tons. On the 27th, the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party arrived, and the workers throughout the factory were in high spirits, raising the output to 147 tons on the same day. On the 30th, it broke through the designed level of 150 tons.

    In the new high tide of production, leaders at all levels have rushed to the front lines of production to further promote the development of the movement. Many district Party secretaries and industrial bureau directors have gone to factories to help grassroots units solve problems. The broad masses of engineering and technical personnel are also in high spirits, rushing to the workshops to work with the workers to attack key production problems. The engineering and technical personnel of the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory expressed their desire to contribute their greatest efforts to manufacturing more new mining equipment and producing sixty-eight new products this year.

    横扫右倾思想　昂首阔步与时间赛跑
    上海工业战线全面跃进
    钢铁一马当先八月比七月增产三分之一轻工业八月份产值创今年最高纪录
    化学工业上升幅度很大纺织工业二十一种主要产品的质量都完成了计划
    据新华社上海5日电　高产、优质、节约全面跃进，老将、新兵齐头并进，干部、工人、技术人员齐心前进，这是上海一个多月来工业增产节约运动新高潮的鲜明特色。这一个多月来，党的“反右倾、鼓  干劲、开展增产节约运动”的号召，鼓起了广大职工群众冲天的干劲；党的八届八中全会公报和决议的公布，更把这个运动推向了新的高峰。全市各工厂纷纷召开群众大会，决心大干特干，为在今年内提前实现第二个五年计划的主要指标而坚决奋勇前进。钢铁工业一马当先。8月份上海的钢产量创造了今年以来的最高纪录，比7月份增长达33％，比去年8月增长一点四倍。特别是8月29日、31日两天的日产量，分别高达七千四百三十八吨和七千三百一十四吨。9月份的头三天，虽然有不少炉子检修，仍然比8月份同期增长19％。轻工业8月份也是今年以来产值最高的一月，下旬几乎比上旬增长了一倍。化学工业产值上升的幅度也很大，中旬比上旬增加39％，下旬又比中旬增长42％。纺织工业虽然受到电力供应的影响，8月份产值仍比7月提高3.7％，超额完成了计划。各个行业不仅产量、产值高，而且质量好，花色品种多，节约成绩大。以纺织工业为例，二十一种主要产品的质量全面完成了8月份计划，是历史上从未有过的。四十多个棉纺织厂中，有三十五个厂的棉纱标准品率达到了100％。全市7、8两月共节约了十五万吨煤和一万二千多吨石油。
      广大职工群众认清了形势，昂首阔步与时间赛跑。这些日子来，新纪录、新技术、新产品纷纷涌现，不少新工程相继完工。有少数工厂已经提前完成了全年的产值计划；还有更多的工厂提出要在国庆节前完成年度计划。以联合生产成套发电设备著名的上海锅炉厂、上海汽轮机厂和上海电机厂三家大厂，已经把今年的指标从六十五万瓩左右分别提高到七十八万至九十一万瓩，占第二个五年计划规定的全国1962年指标的一半以上。上海机床厂在8月24日还只有三十五个青年工人提前完成今年全年的工作量，到31日就有一百十七个提前完成全年工作量，跨入了1960年。到处传出了令人振奋的喜讯：我国第一台三线圈二十二万伏高电压、三万仟伏安容量的巨型变压器试制成功了，有两层楼高，一百三十五吨重；我国第一台精密度极高的十二辊带钢冷轧机也试制成功了，轧辊的表面比镜子还要光滑。新建的规模很大的电炉炼钢车间、现代化的水泥厂等工程，也先后建成了。
    党的指示武装了广大干部和群众的思想，他们纷纷起来横扫自满保守和在困难面前畏缩不前的情绪。安达第一棉纺织厂过去有人反对加快车速，认为高速不能达到优质、低耗、低断头率。但是职工们以第二季度全面完成计划的优异成绩回答了他们。当厂里提出第三季度车速又要加快、断头率再降低的时候，他们又出来说话了：“这是说大话！”“鱼与熊掌，拣一样吃吃就算了，不要驼子跌跟斗，两头不着实。”党委针对这种思想，及时深入地开展思想批判。全厂工人竞赛搞得热火朝天。结果8月份又全面完成计划，产量比7月份增加10％，棉纱标准品率达到100％，断头平均只有九十二根左右。那些当初泼冷水的人，也不得不私下对人说：“看来，发动群众是有道理的！”远东钟厂上半年在同行业中被评为先进厂，但有的干部因此自满了，对当前生产放松了领导，结果7月份产量质量计划都没有完成。领导干部学习了人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论后，重新武装了头脑，向群众作了检查，又亲临前线同群众一起，分析厂内外形势，找出了当前生产上的关键——降低厂内回修率。于是，群众的干劲迅速鼓舞起来，几天之内各小组就排出了一百多个问题，针对这些问题采取了具体措施。产品的厂内回修率马上下降了近一半。8月份产量质量都完成了计划。
    先进的单位和工人更加先进了，落后的单位和工人也迅速赶了上来。上钢三厂平炉是全国的高产红旗，7月份他们又以利用系数达到十三点二而居全国平炉之首，8月份更上升到十五点一。被评为上半年全市棉纺织业优胜厂的国棉二厂、国棉一厂等七个厂职工，从党的“反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动”指示中获得了新的前进动力，8月份在单位产量水平、质量和节约方面继续站在全行业的先进行列。大光明钟厂原是钟表行业中比较落后的厂，已经有四个月没有完成计划。8月份全厂职工鼓起了干劲，力争上游，生产便逐步上升，全月超额完成了任务。
    化学工业中有两家硫酸厂：一家是江苏药水厂，建厂已经有八十几年；一家是上海硫酸厂，是去年大跃进后才建成的新厂。江苏药水厂在去年大跃进中使老工厂恢复了青春，产量比建厂时增长了三十倍，今年他们又继续千方百计地挖掘设备潜力，要使产量增长为建厂时的五十倍。上海硫酸厂的设计能力是日产一百五十吨，但是新厂新人新设备，技术上的困难不少，到8月25日才达到日产一百三十六吨。27日，党的八届八中全会的公报和决议传来，全厂职工情绪振奋，当天就把产量提高到一百四十七吨。30日，就突破了一百五十吨的设计水平。
    在新的生产高潮中，各级领导人员纷纷奔赴生产前线，进一步推动运动的开展。许多区的区委书记、工业局的局长，都下厂帮助基层解决问题。广大工程技术人员也士气旺盛，纷纷下车间，会同工人们一起猛攻生产关键。上海矿山机器厂的工程技术人员们表示：要为制造更多新的采矿设备、在今年制成六十八种新产品，贡献出自己最大的力量。
