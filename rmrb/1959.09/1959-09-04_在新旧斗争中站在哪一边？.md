In the development of the real world, it is always manifested as a process of struggle between the old and new things. In the development of our country's socialist revolution and construction, this struggle is manifested as the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between the socialist road and the capitalist road.  During this struggle, the growth of new things is invincible, and the death of old things is irreversible.  In the eyes of Marxism, what is important is not what seems solid at the moment but has already begun to decline, but what is being produced and developed, even if it is not so solid and perfect at the beginning.  Therefore, revolutionaries must always maintain sensitivity to new things, always stand on the side of the new, oppose the side of the old, and pave the way for the growth of new things.  Thus, all true revolutionaries must adopt a positive attitude of support and "attentive care" towards all new things created in the revolutionary mass movement.  However, another kind of person often appears in the revolutionary ranks. They do not stand at the front of the historical chariot as guides, fighting for the growth of new things; instead, they stand on the side of the old, resenting that the chariot is running too fast, trying to pull it backward and reverse course.  Thus, they are so "calm and composed" about the old situation, and so "frowning and distressed" about the new things; "so willing to compromise on what has already been established, yet so demanding of perfection on what is just beginning" (Lu Xun). Their attitude towards new things shows that they are stubborn elements in the revolutionary ranks.

Lu Xun once wrote an article called "Miscarriage and Sterilization." At that time, the conservative forces in society carried out various attacks and suppressions against the creation of young people, slandering the creation of young people as "miscarriage."  Regarding this kind of slander from the conservative faction, Lu Xun resolutely stood on the side of the new forces and carried out a forceful counterattack. He said, "But if we are to always hear the footsteps of mankind, then I think miscarriage is ultimately more promising than not producing at all, because this has clearly proved that it is capable of producing." Lu Xun's attitude towards new things and his fighting spirit demonstrated a noble revolutionary style.

Not only that, Lu Xun also made a profound and vivid depiction and exposure of the faces of those conservatives. He said:

"The highly intelligent and far-sighted gentlemen enlighten us: if what is born is not a sage, hero, or genius, then don't give birth; if what is written is not an immortal work, then don't write; if reform does not immediately turn into a paradise, or at least give me (!) more benefits, then never move!..."

So, is he a conservative? It is said: not at all. He is precisely a revolutionary. He alone has a fair, just, stable, complete, peaceful, and flawless reform method; he is currently studying it in the laboratory—but it has not been studied yet.

When will it be studied? The answer is: no definite time. Then, let us ask them for advice, what should be done?

"They all say: do not go east, or west, or south, or north. But they don't say you should go east, or west, or south, or north. I finally discovered what they have hidden in their hearts: it's just 'not moving'." (The above quotations are all from the Complete Works of Lu Xun, Volume 3, pages 107-109. Emphasis added by the translator)

Lu Xun's description of the faces of the conservatives in society at that time, and the exposure of what they "have hidden in their hearts," is also quite suitable for the "faces" and "intentions" of the current right-leaning opportunists.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, since 1958, a vigorous mass movement has been launched, a high tide of production and construction has been set off, a Great Leap Forward has been realized, and people's communes have been realized.  This is a decisive historical turning point for our country's revolutionary cause, a development of great historical significance.  All the new things created by the revolutionary mass movement led by the Party have gained vigorous development in our country, and naturally aroused more hatred from all reactionary forces and all hostile forces at home and abroad. Because the interests between the enemy and us are all fundamentally opposed. The more we "go all out, aim high," the more difficult it is to save their doom; thus, the more they attack, slander, and curse us, the more they will stop at nothing. But the more frantic the enemy is, the more it proves their panic and fright, and the more afraid they are of their own doomsday coming. All of this is understandable. Under this situation of class struggle, it is not accidental that echoes and spokespersons will always be found in the revolutionary ranks. Because of this, that small handful of right-leaning opportunists could not wait to show their true colors.

They launched vicious attacks on the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, made metaphysical exaggerations of individual shortcomings, and turned a blind eye to the great achievements. They said that this "was ruined" and that "was messed up"; this is "more loss than gain" or "more loss than gain", and that is "a petty-bourgeois fanatic movement". In short, our revolutionary cause was simply described by them as "pitch black". In their view, it is just as Lu Xun had revealed, "if reform does not immediately turn into a paradise," "then never move"; it seems that "he alone has a fair, just, stable, complete, peaceful, and flawless reform method." Isn't the hypocritical and shameful face of the current right-leaning opportunists just like this?

As soon as our country's Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes came out, the vicious attacks of reactionary elements at home and abroad followed one after another. They slandered us as "forced labor" and "depriving people of freedom", and slandered that our affairs were done "terribly". This is just like what Lu Xun once refuted the imperialists' slander against the Soviet Union: it seems that they would rather we immediately turn into paradise, and everyone enjoys happiness. "Now it's like this, it's disappointed, uncomfortable. - This is really the tears of a demon." (Complete Works of Lu Xun, Volume 4, page 328) Aren't the tunes sung by those right-leaning opportunists exactly "shining" with the "tears of a demon"?

So, what is "hidden in their hearts"? There are some people who can still slowly move forward during the democratic revolution, but they stop moving forward when it comes to the socialist revolution. Because what is functioning in their minds is still the bourgeois standpoint, bourgeois idealism, and the bourgeois world view. For the socialist revolution, what they "have hidden in their hearts" is still "just 'not moving'". But they don't move and oppose others moving, they no longer revolt and oppose others revolting. Thus, they are bound to have "infinite worries" about the revolution, complaining that we are doing too much, and that our revolution and construction are developing too fast. Especially with the deepening of the socialist revolution, what is buried in their "hearts" will increasingly transform to the opposite side of the revolution, and even take a hostile attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement. When the time is right, it will break out without hesitation.

For the socialist revolution, the so-called question of attitude towards new things is actually the question of how to treat the revolution and the revolutionary mass movement. Is it to adopt a bourgeois master-style attitude, standing outside or opposite the mass movement? Or is it to adopt a Marxist-Leninist attitude, standing enthusiastically in the midst of the mass movement? The two attitudes towards the revolutionary movement show the sharp opposition between the bourgeois standpoint and the proletarian standpoint. And the right-leaning opportunists are standing on the side of not moving between moving and "not moving"; in the struggle between the new and the old, they are standing on the side of the old. They are so afraid of the revolutionary mass movement that they prefer the kind of "flawless reform method" that has "no definite time". They have even adopted an attitude of "fierce-browed defiance of the thousand pointing fingers" towards the leadership of the Party and the revolutionary mass movement. And their rampant attack is nothing but an exposure of what they "have hidden in their hearts," reflecting the wails of a dying class on the verge of death. This is a serious class struggle, and we must thoroughly crush this rampant attack.

Originally, people's views on problems always reflect their position. The reason why all the new things created in our revolutionary movement are so unsuitable for their "appetite" is because their "appetite" is for capitalism. What we think is done well, of course, is "terrible" for those decadent forces; what we "gain" is, of course, their "loss"; our light, of course, simultaneously means their darkness. For the people of our country, the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes are unprecedented new things; and for those decadent forces, of course, it also means that this is a sign of promoting their death. If a socialist world view is not functioning in a person's mind, capitalist things will spread. The so-called "you die and I live" struggle is also manifested here.

The world is always developing, and people are always walking, "not moving" is not possible. However, not taking the socialist road will lead to the capitalist road. Similarly, in this struggle between the new and the old, not standing on this side is to stand on that side, not approaching this side is to approach that side, there is no transcendent position. Not "going all out and aiming high" will lead to a downward trend. That's why we say that right-leaning is the main danger at present.

But new things always grow in struggle, and always pave the way for themselves in the struggle with old things. The so-called struggle of opposites is the source of development. In this struggle, only progress eliminates stubbornness, there is absolutely no stubbornness eliminating progress; if stubborn elements do not want to be eliminated, they have to progress themselves. That is to say, right-leaning opportunists must abandon that bourgeois egoistic standpoint and abandon the bourgeois decadent world view.

### 在新旧斗争中站在哪一边？

    在新旧斗争中站在哪一边？
    吴传启
    现实世界的发展，总是表现为一个新旧事物之间进行斗争的过程。在我国社会主义革命和建设的发展中，这种斗争表现为无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间的斗争。在这种斗争中，新事物的生长是不可战胜的，旧事物的死亡是难以挽回的。在马克思主义看来，重要的不是现时似乎坚固，但已开始衰亡着的东西；而是正在产生和发展着的东西；那怕它起初还不那么巩固和完善。所以革命者必须始终保持对新鲜事物的敏感，始终站在新的一方，反对旧的一面，为新事物的生长开辟道路。由此，一切真正的革命者，对于革命的群众运动中所创造出来的一切新生事物，必须采取积极支持和“殷勤照顾”的态度。可是在革命队伍中也常常出现另一种人。他们不是站在历史车轮的前头当向导，为新事物的生长而斗争；却站在旧事物的一方，怨恨车子跑得太快，企图把它向后拉，开倒车。于是他们对于旧状况是那么“心平气和”，对于新事物又这么“疾首蹙额”；“于已成之局那么委曲求全，于初兴之事就这么求全责备”（鲁迅）。他们对于新事物的这种态度，表明了他们是革命队伍中的顽固派。
    鲁迅曾经写过一篇“流产与断种”的文章。那时社会上的保守势力对于青年的创作进行种种打击和压制，把青年人的创作污蔑为“流产”。对于从保守派方面来的这种污蔑，鲁迅是坚决地站在新生力量的一方，进行了有力的回击。他说：“但如果我们永远要听见人类的足音，则我以为流产究竟比不生产还有望，因为这已经明明白白地证明着能够生产的了。”鲁迅对待新事物的态度，以及他的斗争精神，表现了崇高的革命风格。
    不仅如此，对于那些保守派的嘴脸，鲁迅还作了一个深刻而生动的描绘和揭露。他说：
    “智识高超而眼光远大的先生们开导我们：生下来的倘不是圣贤，豪杰，天才就不要生；写出来的倘不是不朽之作，就不要写；改革的事倘不是一下子就变成极乐世界，或者至少能给我（！）有更多的好处，就万万不要动！……
    那么，他是保守派么？据说：并不然的。他正是革命家。他独有公平，正当，稳健，圆满，平和，毫无流弊的改革法；现下正在研究室里研究着哩，——只是还没有研究好。
    什么时候研究好呢？答曰：没有准儿。”那末，就向他们请教罢，事情究竟该怎么办呢？
    “他们都说：不可向东，或西，或南，或北。但不说应该向东，或西，或南，或北。我终于发见他们心底里的蕴蓄了：不过是一个‘不走’而已。”（以上引文均见鲁迅全集三卷，107—109页。重点为引者加）
    鲁迅所描绘的当时社会上保守派的嘴脸，以及所揭露的他们“心底里的蕴蓄”，对于当前右倾机会主义分子的“嘴脸”和“蕴蓄”来说，也是相当适合的。
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年以来，发动了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，掀起了生产和建设的高潮，出现了全民大跃进，实现了人民公社化。这对于我国的革命事业来说，是一个决定性的历史关键，是有巨大历史意义的发展。党领导的革命的群众运动所创造出来的一切新事物，在我们国家里获得了猛烈的发展，当然要引起国内外一切反动势力、一切敌对力量的更加仇视。因为敌我之间的利害，无一不是根本对立的。我们越是“鼓足干劲，力争上游”，就越使他们的末运难以挽救；于是对我们进行攻击、污蔑、诅咒，就越是要无所不用其极了。但敌人越是这样疯狂，就越是证明他们的恐慌、惊慌，更加害怕自己的末日来临。这一切是可以理解的。在这种阶级斗争的形势下，又总会在革命队伍中找到呼应，找到代言人，这也不是偶然的。正因为是这样，所以那一小撮右倾机会主义分子就迫不及待地露出自己的嘴脸了。
    他们对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社进行了恶毒的攻击，对于个别缺点作形而上学的夸大，对于伟大的成绩却熟视无睹。他们说，这也“搞坏了”，那也“搞糟了”；这里是“得不偿失”或者“有失无得”，那里又是“小资产阶级狂热性运动”。总之，我们的革命事业，简直被他们说成是“漆黑一团”了。在他们看来，就正像鲁迅所揭露过的，“改革的事倘不是一下子就变成极乐世界”，“就万万不要动”；好像“惟独他有公平，正当，稳健，圆满，平和，毫无流弊的改革法”。当前右倾机会主义分子的那种虚伪的可耻的嘴脸，不正是如此么？
    我国的大跃进和人民公社一出规，国内外反动分子的恶毒的攻击就接踵而来，他们污蔑我们是“强迫劳动”、“使人丧失自由”，污蔑我们的事情办得“糟透了”。这也正像鲁迅当年曾经驳斥帝国主义者对苏联的污蔑所说过的：好像他们倒愿意我们一下子就变成天堂，人们个个享福。“现在竟这样子，它失望了，不舒服了。——这真是恶鬼的眼泪。”（鲁迅全集，四卷，328页）那些右倾机会主义分子所唱的调子，岂不是同“恶鬼的眼泪”正相“辉映”吗？
    那末，他们“心底里的蕴蓄”是什么？有一种人，在民主主义革命时期还是可以慢慢向前走的，可是一到社会主义革命时期，就止步不前了。因为在他们头脑里起作用的，还是资产阶级的立场，资产阶级的唯心主义，资产阶级的世界观。对于社会主义革命来说，他们“心底里的蕴蓄”，仍然是“一个‘不走’而已”。但他们不走并且反对别人走，他们不再革命并且反对别人革命。于是他们必然要对革命抱“无穷的忧虑”，埋怨我们的事业办多了，我们的革命和建设事业发展得太快了。特别是随着社会主义革命的日益深入，那种埋藏在他们“心底里的蕴蓄”，就会日益向革命的对立方面转化，以至对革命的群众运动采取仇视的态度。遇到适当的时机，就会迫不及待地爆发出来。
    对于社会主义革命来说，所谓对待新事物的态度问题，实际上也就是如何对待革命和革命的群众运动的问题。是采取资产阶级老爷式的态度，站在群众运动之外或者对面呢？还是采取马克思列宁主义的态度，热情地站在群众运动之中呢？对待革命运动的两种态度，表现了资产阶级立场和无产阶级立场的尖锐对立。而右倾机会主义分子则是在走和“不走”之间，站在不走的一方去了；在新旧之间斗争中，站在旧的一方去了。他们是这样地害怕革命的群众运动，他们喜欢的是“没有准儿”的那种“毫无流弊的改革法”。他们对于党的领导和革命的群众运动，竟然采取了“横眉冷对千夫指”的态度。而他们的这种猖狂进攻，则不过是暴露了他们“心底里的蕴蓄”，反映了过时阶级垂死之际的悲鸣。这是一场严重的阶级斗争，对于这种猖狂进攻，我们必须予以彻底的粉碎。
    本来，人们看问题总是要反映立场的。我们的革命运动中所创造出来的一切新事物，之所以那样不合乎他们的“胃口”，就因为他们的“胃口”是资本主义的。凡我们认为搞得很好的事情，对于那些腐朽势力，当然就是“糟了”；凡我们之“得”，当然就是他们之“失”；我们的光明，当然同时就意味着他们的黑暗。对于我国人民来说，大跃进和人民公社，是史无前例的新生事物；而对于那些腐朽势力来说，当然也就意味着这是促进他们死亡的征兆了。在一个人的头脑中，如果不是社会主义的世界观起作用，资本主义的东西就会传染开来。所谓“你死我活”的斗争也就表现在这里。
    世界总是要不断向前发展的，人也总是要走路的，“不走”是不行的。不过，不走社会主义的路，就会走到资本主义的路上去。同样，在这新旧之间的斗争中，不站在这一边就要站在那一边，不靠近这一边，就要靠近那一边，超然的立场也是没有的。不“鼓足干劲，力争上游”，就会是日趋下游。这就是为什么我们说，右倾是目前的主要危险。
    但新事物又总是在斗争中成长的，总是要在同旧事物的斗争中为自己开辟道路的。所谓对立面的斗争是发展的源泉。在这个斗争中，只有进步取消顽固，决没有顽固取消进步的；顽固分子如要不被取消，除非自己进步才行。这就是说，右倾机会主义分子们必须抛弃那种资产阶级的唯我主义的立场，抛弃资产阶级的腐朽的世界观。
