    The Art Style of the Great Hall of the People
    Design Team of the Great Hall of the People, Beijing Municipal Planning Bureau Design Institute

    The most magnificent building in the capital today, the Great Hall of the People, has been victoriously completed in just over ten months. This is one of the miracles created by the Chinese people under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line.

    This magnificent building is the venue for the National People's Congress, representing the six hundred million people of our country. It was built under the guidance of the Party's General Line for building socialism and inspired by the nationwide Great Leap Forward. This raises the following questions for us in terms of architectural art treatment: how to reflect the momentum of the Great Leap Forward, and demonstrate the great achievements and heroic spirit of the six hundred million people of our country in carrying out socialist construction under the leadership of the Party, while meeting the premise of use. This is an extremely arduous task. First, the image of the building must be both solemn and stable, with a majestic momentum, and simple and generous, light and bright. Secondly, it must meet various complex requirements in use, while maintaining the integrity of the art and rich ideological content. Third, since the building is located in Tiananmen Square, it must be coordinated with Tiananmen to become a glorious and beautiful component of Tiananmen Square, so that the entire square shows a thriving scene.

    This is our starting point for the design. Under the leadership of the Party and the close attention of relevant leading comrades, after repeated discussions with artists, scientists, architects, and workers from all walks of life, and repeated revisions, the Great Hall of the People finally achieved relatively satisfactory artistic achievements.

            (I)

    In terms of design philosophy, should we focus on expressing the building itself, or on showing the broad masses of people who use it? We advocate "things are used by people" and "people are the masters," so that it serves the people, and the broad masses of people who enjoy it feel happy and feel that they are the masters of the building. The architectural design of the Great Hall of the People was carried out under the guidance of this idea.

    The overall shape of the building is coordinated with the Museum of the Revolution and the Museum of History across the square, adopting a form with the middle slightly higher and the two wings slightly lower, so that people feel that the building has a clear primary and secondary distinction, and is stable and symmetrical. Its total width of 336 meters and the width of the square of 500 meters constitute an appropriate ratio of three to five. In this way, the masses active in the square do not feel empty or closed. The wall is divided into five groups in an arc shape. The height-to-width ratio of each group is not affected by the total width, and the maximum does not exceed one to three, so that people feel that the volume is moderate. The surrounding area adopts a round column colonnade form, taking its upright and powerful nature. The light red granite foundation implies a stable and solid meaning. The light apricot-yellow chopped axe wall surface is combined with an open and uniform window surface, giving people a light and bright feeling. The glossy green, yellow, and light green glass eaves outline the entire building very conspicuously. When people approach the gate, the building's shape is very large, but people do not feel any oppression because the slope of the steps is gentle, and different treatments are used for flower beds and driveways. Large flower beds are set on the left and right sides of the large platform on both sides of the east steps, and the edge of the platform is made into a slope shape, with grass in the middle, which is convenient for people to go up and down, and is integrated with the garden in front, increasing the level of greening and highlighting the grand atmosphere of the entire building and the square, and closely linking the crowds active in the square with this building. All of this makes people feel that it is both solemn and majestic, and approachable. This is fundamentally different from the architectural techniques of coercion in the feudal era and the fetishism in the capitalist era.

    The central hall is the central hub of the entire building and a place for people to rest. Its height is equivalent to a four-story building, with a volume of 54,000 cubic meters and a bottom area of 3,600 square meters. If it is not handled properly, it is easy for people to feel uncomfortable. Here, the method of three main bays wide and four secondary bays narrow is adopted, so that the height-to-width ratio forms a habitual ratio of one to one to one to 1.3. At the same time, a promenade is surrounded on all sides to divide the space, so that people feel that the scale is appropriate. In some parts that are closely related to people, such as column bases, wall guards, door leaves, and footboards, the dimensions are not excessively large. In addition, the color of the entire hall is mainly quiet and bright gold and white, set off by a warm dark red wall and peach-red floor, which makes people resting here feel comfortable, kind, and quiet.

    The artistic treatment of the Great Auditorium is even more complicated. The auditorium is 76 meters wide, 60 meters deep, and 32 meters high in the middle, with a volume ten times that of ordinary auditoriums and theaters. How to make people feel not small and not depressed for such a large space is a new topic. First of all, the artistic treatment of the ceiling and walls has a great relationship with people's activities and perceptions in it. If the ceiling is treated in the way of general cinemas tilting downwards, it will give people sitting in the back row of the balcony and on the rostrum a feeling of oppression and stuffiness. If it is made into a flat roof and straight walls like a general auditorium, it is easy to make people feel dull and empty. In order to obtain close to practical perceptual knowledge, in the design, we made two one-tenth large models, and made serious tests from structure to shape. After repeated research and discussion by combining leadership and the masses, it was finally designed into a "water and sky" shape, with the ceiling and walls intersecting at rounded corners to form a vault image, which is integrated up and down, making people feel neither oppressive nor empty. Three circles of wave-shaped concealed light troughs are made on the ceiling, shrinking from elliptical to circular layer by layer. The center is a red five-pointed star, surrounded by gilded sunflowers, radiating golden light, symbolizing that the people of the whole country are closely united around the Party, and determined to struggle to make China's revolutionary cause move from victory to greater victory. The organic combination of the structure, decoration, and color of the entire auditorium forms a cheerful, fresh, and aspiring atmosphere.

            (II)

    In the design, we have earnestly implemented the principles of suitability, economy, and attention to beauty under possible conditions, so that the artistic treatment of the building, the use of the building, and economy can complement each other and achieve a complete artistic effect.

    The banquet hall has an area of 7,000 square meters, and a half football field can be placed in it, which is very large in scale. We have considered its layout in many ways, and finally decided to make the plane of the hall a cross shape, leaving the end wings of the four corners for other purposes. This treatment creates favorable conditions for applicability, economy, and beauty. The rostrum is set at one end of the center of the hall, which conforms to traditional habits and shortens the distance between the host and the guest. The service surface is placed on both wings of the hall, making the service surface long and the supply line short. There are positions for photography and bands in the promenade on both sides and opposite the rostrum. This also increases the artistic atmosphere of the hall. The central square well is directly connected to the end wings of the four corners, and the ceiling is raised layer by layer, forming an organic combination with the promenade. These deployments make the art of the entire hall a complete system, and the hall also achieves an appropriate spatial proportion.

    Modern equipment such as sound, lighting, ventilation, broadcasting, telecommunications, electromechanical, and photography are all arranged in the building decoration, which not only saves materials, but is also comfortable and convenient to use. For example, the news film lighting around the Great Auditorium is all concealed above the wall guard on the first floor, and beautiful metal flower grilles are added on the outside for decoration. The triangular area on both sides in front of the Great Auditorium is a tall space, and we made it into eight interlayers as control machine rooms, so that all the machine equipment is installed inside. This is also convenient for operation and use.

    When the artistic treatment of some places is restricted by the structure and heating, mechanical and electrical equipment, and ventilation equipment, the visual laws of people are used to solve this contradiction by using the techniques of mutual transformation of size, thickness, height and low. The glazed cornice part above the east gate is as high as ten meters, as if a three-story building is pressing on it, which seems very heavy. After we divided the cornice into several sections such as ridge walls, cornices, lotus petals, and flower boards, and then decorated them into different colors, the cornice seems to have changed from large to small. Similar architectural art treatments that use visual laws are many in the design of the Great Hall of the People.

    When considering economic conditions, on the one hand, we fully utilize the building area and space, and on the other hand, we carefully calculate the materials. The space under the steps of the four gates in the east, south, west, and north has been used as warehouses, garages, and temporary rest places for drivers. All the hardwood decoration in the halls and rooms is replaced by five-ply plywood as much as possible, which not only saves a lot of high-grade wood, but also is easy to process and is very beautiful.

          (III)

    It is difficult to unify opinions on the formal style of architectural art. After the leadership's enlightenment, the principle of "all the essence of China and foreign countries, ancient and modern, should be used for my purpose" was determined in the design. This has opened up a broad road for architectural art creation.

    The exterior facade adopts the three-section method of traditional Chinese platform base, wall body, and eaves, but abandons the ancient Dougong large roof and replaces it with a glass flat cantilevered eaves supported by lotus petal lines. The colonnade of the East Gate adopts the method of main bay, secondary bay, and end bay. The column spacing in the middle is widened to make the five golden yellow main gates more brilliant and prominent. If the height-to-thickness ratio of the surrounding columns is according to the Western classical ratio of six to one-tenth, the column diameter will reach more than 2.5 meters, which will appear clumsy. We have widened the ratio to one-twelfth and a half, and the base part of the column head and the column adopts the traditional Chinese lotus petal and scroll patterns, which looks very symmetrical. The lamps on the ceiling of the banquet hall do not use ancient and light-shielding palace lamps. In addition to the bright chandeliers, all ordinary buckle ceiling lamps and large crystal lamps are used to meet the requirements of bright light. The surroundings of the lamp opening and the air duct opening are new-style caisson ceiling planes composed of plaster flower decorations and gilded patterns. The color of the entire banquet hall is mainly light green and beige, interspersed with orange-red flower decoration buckles, which makes the hall appear rich, novel, light, and lively, and blends with the joyful atmosphere during the banquet. The plaster flower-attached ceiling lamp came from abroad, and now it is painted with color and gilded in the traditional way. The gilded caisson ceiling is a traditional method, which is now treated with new patterns and colors. In terms of interior decoration, we have combined different conditions and strived to absorb the essence of architectural art at home and abroad, ancient and modern.

          (IV)

    Everyone lacked experience in handling such a large-scale project. At the beginning, some designers were a little timid and did not know where to start. At this time, the leading comrade told us a story: As early as the Five Dynasties period, there was a painter named Sheng Rong. When he first painted the image of the Bodhisattva, he painted it according to the Buddha statues transmitted from India, and the masses did not like it. He was determined to create an image that the masses liked. He hung up the painted Bodhisattva image and hid behind the image to listen to people's comments, and then absorbed everyone's opinions and repeatedly revised it. He painted like this for ten years, and finally created a perfect image that has been passed down to this day. This inspiring story tells us that only by taking the mass line can we enrich architectural art.

    Initially, there were many disputes about the form of the column head, and the design was not very sure. Later, according to the opinions of all parties, more than a dozen column head models with flat, round, square, and cross shapes were made, and the masses were mobilized to speak freely and debate, and then summarized into five types. Three of them are flat horizontal column heads supported on round columns, one is a cross-shaped column head with a flower hoop around the waist, and the other is a round lotus petal column head covered with a square plate. From the picture, everyone felt that the cross-shaped column head was better. When it was made into a real sample with plaster and placed at the real height, everyone liked the flat and round types. Finally, after synthesizing everyone's opinions and revising it twice, the waist hoop of the cross-shaped column head was added, and the round plate was used for the round column head, so the current lotus petal round column head was determined. The form of the grandstand, the size of the lamps, and the wall decoration inside the Great Auditorium were also made into one-tenth large models, which were repeatedly revised nine times. Other things, such as the column spacing and column diameter of the east and west gate colonnades, and the color and method of the chopped axe stone wall, were repeatedly revised after listening to the opinions of leading comrades, designers from all parties, and the broad masses of people before they were finalized.

          (V)

    In the process of handling architectural art, although we have solicited opinions from all parties, due to the large number of halls and rooms in the Great Hall of the People, the complex content, the tight time, and the fact that our design level is not high and our artistic accomplishment is still poor, it is difficult to achieve perfection in the treatment of architectural art. In addition to trying our best to do the design well, in order to facilitate future modifications, we have tried to leave room for maneuver and not to make the article too absolute at one time. The flower decorations on the column heads of the four major gate colonnades are required to be made of marble according to the design requirements, but now they are temporarily made of prefabricated white brushed stone. In the future, after everyone's evaluation, it will be easy to make real stone carvings. The colors of the walls and ceilings of the halls are mainly plain, so as to solicit opinions and deepen them if necessary. The counters and coat racks in the cloakroom are not fixed. If it is found that the location is inappropriate, they can be moved elsewhere. The decoration of general halls and rooms is also relatively simple, and it can be further enriched in the future.

    We believe that with the close care of the people of the whole country and the efforts of architects across the country, we will definitely be able to further modify the architectural art treatment of this Great Hall to be more beautiful.

    人民大会堂的艺术风格
    北京市城市规划管理局设计院　人民大会堂设计组
    首都当前最宏伟的建筑——人民大会堂，在短短十个多月的时间内胜利建成了。这是中国人民在党的总路线光辉照耀下创造的奇迹之一。
    这个宏伟的建筑是我国六亿人民代表大会开会的场所。它是在党的建设社会主义总路线的指导和在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下兴建的。这在建筑艺术处理方面，就向我们提出了这样的问题：如何在满足使用的前提下，反映出大跃进的声势，显示出我国六亿人民在党的领导下进行社会主义建设所取得的伟大成就和英雄气概。这是一个极其艰巨的任务。首先，建筑物的形象，既要庄严稳重，气势雄伟，又要朴素大方，轻快明朗。其次，在使用上要满足各种复杂的要求，又要保持艺术的完整性和丰富的思想内容。第三，由于建筑物位置在天安门广场，这就必须使它同天安门相协调，成为天安门广场的一个光辉的、美丽的组成部分，使整个广场显现出一派欣欣向荣的景象。
    这就是我们进行设计的出发点。在党的领导和有关领导同志的亲切关怀下，经过同各有关方面的艺术家、科学家、建筑工作者和各业工人同志们反复探讨，一再修改，最后使人民大会堂取得了令人比较满意的艺术成就。
            （一）
    在设计思想上，是表现建筑物的本身为主呢？还是显示使用它的广大人民为主呢？我们主张“物为人用”，“以人为主”，使它为人民服务，使享用的广大人民群众感到心情舒畅，感到自己就是建筑物的主人。人民大会堂的建筑设计，就是在这种思想的指导下进行的。
    整个建筑物的体型，和广场对面的革命博物馆、历史博物馆相协调，采取中部略高、两翼稍低的形式，使人们感到建筑物主次分明，平稳而又匀称。它的总面宽三百三十六米，与广场的宽度五百米构成三与五的适当比例。这样，在广场活动的群众，就既不感到空旷，又不感到封闭。墙面按弓字形分成五组，每组的高宽比例，不受总面宽的影响，最大不超过一与三之比，使人感觉体量适度。四周采用圆柱柱廊形式，取其挺拔有力。浅红色花岗石的基础，寓有稳重雄厚的意思。浅杏黄色的剁斧墙面和开阔匀整的窗面相结合，予人以轻快明朗的感觉。富有光泽的绿、黄、浅绿色的玻璃檐部，把整个建筑物的轮廓勾画得十分醒目。当人们走近大门的时候，由于台阶坡度平缓，再加上用花坛、车道作了不同的处理，尽管建筑物的体形很高大，但人们并不感到有任何压抑。东面大台阶两侧的大平台左右，设置了大花坛，平台边沿做成斜坡状，中间铺有草皮，便利人们上下，并且和前面的花园打成一片，增加了绿化的层次，烘托出整个建筑物和广场的宏伟气魄，密切了活动在广场上的人群和这座建筑物的联系。所有这一切，都使人感到它既庄严雄伟，又平易近人。这同封建时代以威慑取胜和资本主义时代拜物教的建筑手法根本不同。
    中央大厅是整个建筑物的中心枢纽，同时又是人们的休息场所。它的高度相当于四层楼房，体积达五万四千立方米，底层面积有三千六百平方米。面积这样大，空间这样高，如果处理不当，很容易使人感到不习惯，不舒适。在这里，采用了三个主间宽、四个次间窄的方法，使高宽比形成一比一到一比一点三的习惯比例，同时在四周环以走马楼，将空间分割处理，使人感觉尺度适宜。在一些与人们接触较密切的部位上，如柱础、护墙、门扇、踏脚板等，都做得尺寸不过分高大。再加上整个大厅的色彩以恬静明快的金白色为主，衬以温暖的暗红墙身、桃红地面，这便使在这里休息的人们感到舒适、亲切和安静。
    大礼堂的艺术处理，更加复杂。这个礼堂的宽度达七十六米，深有六十米，中部高三十二米，体积十倍于普通的礼堂和剧场。对这样大的空间，在处理手法上怎样使人不感觉渺小，不感觉沉闷，这是一个新的课题。首先，顶篷和墙面的艺术处理，对人在其中的活动、观感有着很大的关系，假如顶篷按一般电影院往下倾斜的办法处理，就会给坐在楼座后排和主席台上的人，产生压抑闷气的感觉。如果按一般礼堂的作法做成平顶直墙，又容易使人感到呆板空旷。为了取得接近实际的感性知识，在设计中，我们作了两个十分之一的大模型，从结构到造型，都作了认真的试验。经过领导和群众相结合的反复研究讨论，最后设计成“水天一色”的形状，顶篷与墙面圆角相交，成穹窿形象，上下混然一体，使人感觉既不压抑又不空旷。顶篷上作三圈水波形暗灯槽，从椭圆形逐层收缩为圆形，中心为红色的五角红星，围以镏金的向日葵花，放射束束金光，象征着全国人民紧密地团结在党的周围，坚决奋斗，使中国的革命事业，从胜利走向更大的胜利。整个礼堂的构造、装修和色彩的有机结合，形成开朗、清新、奋发的气氛。
            （二）
    在设计中，我们切实贯彻执行了适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观的原则，使建筑艺术的处理、建筑物的使用和节约，能够相辅相成，达到完整的艺术效果。
    宴会厅的面积达七千平方米，可以把一个半足球场摆了进去，规模是很大的。我们曾多方面考虑它的布局，最后确定把厅的平面作成十字形，留出四角的端翼作其他用途。这样处理后，就为适用、经济、美观创造了有利条件。主席台设在大厅的正中一端，符合传统习惯，缩短了宾主之间的距离。服务面摆在大厅的两翼，使服务面长，供应线短。主席台两侧和对面的走马廊，有摄影、乐队的位置。这样也增加了大厅的艺术气氛。中部方井与四角的端翼直接相通，顶篷逐层升高，与走马廊形成有机的结合。这些部署，使整个大厅的艺术成为一个完整的体系，大厅也因此取得了适当的空间比例。
    声响、照明、通风、广播、电讯、机电、摄影等近代设备，都安排在建筑装修中，既节约了资材，在使用上也舒适方便。例如，大礼堂四周的新闻电影灯光，就全部暗藏在一层护墙上面，外加轻巧的金属花篦子，装饰得很好看。大礼堂前面两侧的三角地带，是一个高大的空间，我们把它做成八个夹层，作为控制机房，让全部机器设备都安在里边，这样做，在操作使用上也很方便。
    有些地方的艺术处理受到结构和采暖、机械电器、通风等设备的限制时，便利用人的视觉规律，采取大小、粗细、高低互相变换的手法，来解决这一矛盾。东面大门上部的琉璃檐口部分，高达十米，好像一座三层楼房压在上面，显得很重。我们把檐口分割成脊墙、檐口、莲瓣、花板等几段后，再分段装饰成不同的颜色，檐口好像由大变小了。类似这种利用视觉规律的建筑艺术处理，在人民大会堂的设计中是很多的。
    在考虑经济条件时，一面充分利用建筑面积和空间，一面在用料上精打细算。东、南、西、北四个大门的台阶下部的空间，都已利用作为仓库、车库和司机的临时休息场所。厅室内的全部硬杂木装修，尽量用五夹胶合板来代替，不仅节省了大量高级木料，而且便于加工，也很美观。
          （三）
    建筑艺术上的形式风格，各方面意见很难一致。经过领导上的启发，在设计上确定了“中外古今，一切精华，皆为我用”的原则。这样就给建筑艺术创作开辟了广阔的道路。
    外立面采用我国传统的台基、墙身、屋檐三段手法，但抛弃了古老的斗拱大屋顶，改用莲瓣线承托的玻璃平板挑檐。东大门柱廊采用主间、次间、梢间的手法，中间柱距加宽，使五樘金黄色的正门更加辉煌突出。四周廊柱的高粗比，若按西洋古典六到十分之一的比例，则柱径将达二点五米以上，就显得粗笨，我们把比例放宽到十二点五分之一，柱头和柱子的基础部分，采用了我国传统的莲瓣和卷草花纹，看上去也很匀称。宴会厅顶篷上的灯具，没有采用古老而遮光的宫灯，除了明亮的吊灯以外，全部用普通的扣顶灯和大水晶灯，达到光线明亮的要求。灯口和风道口的周围，是石膏花饰和沥粉贴金图案组成的新式藻井天花平面。整个宴会厅的色彩以淡绿、米黄为主，间以桔红色的花饰卡子，使厅内显得富丽、新颖、轻快、活泼，和宴会进行中的欢乐气氛融汇在一起。石膏花贴顶灯是从外国传来的，现在用传统的方式给它涂上了色，贴上了金。沥粉贴金藻井天花是传统的作法，现在用新的图案和色彩加以处理。在内部装修方面，都结合不同的条件，努力吸取了中外古今建筑艺术上的精华。
          （四）
    处理这样大规模的工程，大家都缺乏经验。开始，有的设计人员心里有些胆怯，不知从何下笔。这时候，领导同志给我们讲了一个故事：远在五代时期，有一个名叫盛荣的画家。他最初画菩萨像的时候，是根据从印度传来的佛像画的，群众不喜欢。他立志要创造出一个群众喜爱的形象。他便把画出来的菩萨像挂出去，自己躲在画像后面，听取人们的议论，然后吸取大家的意见反复修改。这样一直画了十年，最后创造成一直流传到现在的完美形象。这个富有启发性的故事，告诉我们只有走群众路线，才能丰富建筑艺术。
    最初，对柱头的形式争论很多，设计很没把握。后来就根据各方面的意见，做了扁的、圆的、方的、十字形的十几种柱头模型，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，然后归纳成五种类型。其中三种是扁横的柱头托在圆柱之上，一种是十字形的柱头，加上一个束腰的花箍，另一种是圆形莲瓣的柱头，上面盖上一个方盘。从画面上看，大家都觉得十字形的柱头比较好。等到用石膏做成实样摆在真实高度时，大家都喜欢扁的和圆的类型。最后综合大家的意见，又经过两次修改，把十字形柱头的腰箍加了进去，圆形柱头改用圆形盖盘，才确定了现在的莲瓣式圆形柱头。大礼堂里面的挑台形式，灯具大小，墙壁装饰，也是作成十分之一的大模型，反复修改了九次。其他像东西大门柱廊的柱距、柱径、剁斧石墙面的颜色作法，都是不断听取领导同志、各方面设计工作者和广大群众的意见后，反复修改才定案的。
            （五）
    在处理建筑艺术过程中，我们虽然征求了各方面的意见，但是，由于人民大会堂的厅室多，内容复杂，时间紧迫，再加上我们的设计水平不高，艺术修养还差，因此，在建筑艺术处理上很难做到尽善尽美。我们除努力把设计作好外，为了便于将来修改，还设法留有余地，不把文章一次作绝。四面大门柱廊的柱头花饰，按照设计要求是用大理石做，现在都暂用预制白色刷石组成，将来经过大家品评之后，便于作成真的石雕刻。厅堂的墙壁和顶篷的颜色，都以素淡为主，以便征求意见，必要时加深。衣帽厅的柜台、衣架不是固定的，如果发现位置不恰当，也可以移到别处。一般厅室的装修也比较简单，将来可以进一步加以丰富。
    我们相信在全国人民亲切关怀下，在全国建筑工作者的努力下，一定能进一步把这个大会堂的建筑艺术处理修改得更为美好。
