    The Rebirth of a "Newspaper Boy"
    Staff Member, Newspaper Distribution Group, Hangzhou Postal Bureau, Shao Yue

    Before Liberation, I was a "newspaper boy."

    In 1947, I graduated from a journalism school in Shanghai but couldn't find a job for a long time. Later, a kind classmate told me about a job in Hangzhou distributing newspapers published in Shanghai. However, it was said that this job wasn't easy and that it wasn't very respectable for a college graduate to do this kind of work, because the job, to put it nicely, was that of a newspaper staff member, and to put it bluntly, was that of a "newspaper boy"—which was the general term for newspaper carriers, vendors, and newspaper distribution personnel at the time. At that time, there were countless unemployed people; I personally saw a university professor selling zongzi on the street to make a living. In that era of graduation meaning unemployment, I dared not be picky about the quality of the job, so I ended up doing that work.

    I still clearly remember the scene of my first day on the job. I went to the Hangzhou Railway Station Post Office Building and, on the scorching roadside and under the withered trees, saw an extremely desolate world among the bottom strata of society. Many newspaper vendors stood there, including men, women, old, and young. Most of them were sallow and emaciated, and their clothes were tattered. Some children were practically naked. There were also a few special figures; they stood next to that Japanese-style railway station, all wearing snow-white or gray silk short shirts and trousers, chatting and laughing, extremely triumphant. My job was to distribute the newspapers received from the post office to those vendors. My "office" was set up on the sidewalk outside the Post Office Building. At that time, trains were severely delayed, and the post office's work was also very sluggish. The working hours were prolonged for a long time. It wasn't until I was dizzy from the sun and my eyes were blurring that I saw a postal worker throw out bundles of newspapers from the gate. As I squatted down, lowered my head, and was counting the newspapers to the vendors, suddenly a shout of "Hey!" startled me. I looked up in surprise and saw one of the men in shorts, his face turned to the side, his eyes looking elsewhere, snatching the newspapers I was counting and saying in a strange voice to his partner, "This 'lao guan' (Hangzhou dialect, meaning villager) is a bumpkin; we must teach him a lesson!" After saying that, he stretched out two large hands like cattail leaf fans and slapped me heavily twice. By the time I bent down to pick up my glasses that had fallen to the ground, several bundles of newspapers had disappeared. It turned out that in front of the Post Office Building at that time, it was the world of the newspaper distribution feudal bosses. The newspaper distribution industry in Hangzhou was controlled by four major bosses, known as the "Four Overlords." Anyone who wanted to gain a foothold in this area had to pay them tribute in advance. I had just come out of school and didn't understand these rules, so I was beaten on the first day. That's how I embarked on my path to earning a living!

    Although I found such a job, what kind of life was I living at that time! Prices were soaring, and money was worthless. My meager salary wasn't even enough to eat, let alone for other expenses. When winter came, I didn't even have a cotton coat. The howling cold wind blew straight into my back, so I tied straw ropes unbound from newspaper bundles around my waist to block the wind... On the eve of Liberation, I was truly reduced to a "newspaper boy."

    In May 1949, Hangzhou was liberated. The long night finally came to an end, and my newspaper boy life also ended.

    First, I assisted the representative sent by the Party newspaper to take over the old newspaper office for the people.

    Later, because I had a relatively good understanding of the private newspaper distribution industry, when I served as the head of the Business Management Group of the Distribution Section of the Zhejiang Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, the higher authorities assigned me to participate in the transformation of the private newspaper distribution industry throughout the province. This was truly a huge social transformation, and the struggle was extremely sharp and complex. To give an example: Once, we went to a small city to carry out this work. There was a small boss there who had consistently disrupted the post office's distribution work and was extremely arrogant. Knowing that we were there to deal with his problems, as soon as we arrived, he sent someone with a note to threaten us. The note read: "Leave some leeway, or else, a bare blade will enter, and a red blade will come out; we will not hesitate to fight with our lives." After reading it, we sneered. We were no longer the newspaper boys of the pre-Liberation era, and we couldn't be slapped in the face again. The Party was backing us up! The Party has overthrown your backer, the Kuomintang reactionaries; are we still afraid of you, a small fry! Later, we mobilized the masses and, with the assistance of the local public security and judicial departments, finally defeated this small boss. Newspaper carriers and vendors were also properly resettled. Some were transferred to work in factories or enterprises, some were absorbed into the post office, and some returned to their hometowns to engage in production. The newspaper boys who had been humiliated and persecuted were completely liberated!

    For the past ten years, I have been constantly receiving the Party's education and nurturing. In the early days of Liberation, I was not very comfortable with my newspaper distribution work. Due to the influence of the old society, I always felt that doing newspaper distribution work was not very glorious and always wanted to change jobs. When I mentioned this issue, the Party organization taught me this way: "The newspaper distribution work after Liberation is essentially different from the work you did before. Our newspapers are the most powerful weapons for propagating the truth, so doing distribution work is the most glorious thing." One of the leaders also told me many stories about how revolutionary leaders valued the distribution of Party newspapers. When I learned that some responsible comrades, during the White Terror period, personally hawked Party newspapers on the streets of Chongqing in order to publicize the Party's policies, I couldn't help but lower my head in shame. Soon, another event gave me a great education. That was when the Zhejiang Postal and Telecommunications Administration elected grassroots trade union committee members and elected me as well. From this matter, I also clearly realized that I was no longer the newspaper boy who was looked down upon in the old society. How could I not be excited? How could I not settle down and work hard?

    After resolving the issue of not being comfortable with my work, I immediately worked hard to study the business and do my job well. In order to better learn from the advanced experience of Soviet newspaper distribution work, I started learning Russian in 1950. Over the years, I have edited and translated many articles related to distribution work and published them in newspapers and magazines such as "People's Posts and Telecommunications" and "Distributor," introducing the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to our colleagues.

    Now my office is located inside the Post Office Building. Looking down from the window, below is the place where I used to be slapped by the feudal bosses. Whenever I look at that place, my glasses become blurred. I myself don't believe that I am the newspaper boy who used to stand outside, shivering in the cold wind. I have become a new person.

    报花子的新生
    杭州市邮电局报刊发行组职员　邵越
    我在解放前是个报花子。
    1947年，我在上海一个新闻专科学校毕了业，很久没有找到职业。后来，有位好心的同学告诉我，在杭州有个分发上海出版的报纸的工作。不过，据说这碗饭不大好吃，而且一个专科毕业生做这工作也不大体面，因为这工作说得好听些，也算是报社工作人员，说得不好听，就是当报花子——这是当时对报童、报贩和报纸发行人员的统称。那时失业的人不知有多少，我就亲眼看到过一位大学教授在街头卖粽子过日子。在那毕业即失业的时候，我哪里还敢挑拣工作的好坏，到底去干那个工作了。
    现在我还清楚地记得第一天去干那个工作的情景。我到了杭州火车站邮政大厦旁边，在烈日炎炎的马路边和干枯的小树底下，见到了当时社会底层中的一个极其凄凉的世界。那里站着许多报贩，其中男女老少都有。他们大都面黄肌瘦，衣衫褴褛，有些小孩子，简直是光着屁股。也有几个特殊人物，他们站在那座日本式的火车站旁边，一个个穿着雪白的或灰色的绸质短衫裤，谈谈笑笑，得意非凡。我的工作，是把从邮局领来的报纸发给那些报贩。我的“办公桌”，就设在邮政大厦外面的人行道上。那时的火车误点误得很厉害，加上邮局的工作也很疲沓，工作时间拖延了很久，直到我在烈日下晒得头脑发胀、两眼发花了，才见一个邮政人员把报纸一捆一捆从大门里抛了出来。当我蹲下身子，低下头，正在把报纸数给报贩时，突然一声“呔！”我吃惊地抬头一看，只见那些穿短裤的人中的一个歪着脸，眼睛看着别处，一边把我正在数的报纸夺去，一边怪声怪气地对着他的伙伴说：“这个佬倌是乡瓜头儿（杭州土话，意即乡下人），非给他点颜色看看不可！”说完，他就伸出两只像蒲扇一样的大手，重重打了我两下耳光。等我俯下身去拾被打落在地上的眼镜时，几捆报纸又不翼而飞了。原来，那时的邮政大厦门前，是派报业封建把头的世界。杭州的派报业有四个大把头把持，号称“四大霸天”。凡是到这块地面上来立脚的，事先总得要孝敬孝敬他们。我刚从学校里出来，哪里懂得这些规矩，于是第一天就挨了打。我就是这样踏上自己谋生的道路的！
    虽然找到这么个工作，可是那时候过的是什么日子啊！物价飞涨，钞票不值钱，我那一点微薄的薪金，连吃饭都不够，当然更谈不上派别的用场了。冬天来了，我连棉衣都没有。呼呼的冷风直往背心灌，我就用报捆上解下来的草绳往腰里一扎，挡挡风……解放前夕，我真的完全沦落成“报花子”了。
    1949年5月，杭州解放了，漫漫长夜总算到头了，我的报花子生活也从此结束了。
    首先我协助党报派来的代表把旧报社接管为人民所有。
    后来，因我对私营派报业情况比较了解，在我担任浙江省邮电管理局发行科业务管理组组长的时候，上级又派我参加对全省私营派报业的改造工作。这真是一个巨大的社会改造工作，斗争是非常尖锐复杂的。举一个例子：有一次，我们到一个小城市去搞这项工作。当地有个小把头，他一贯破坏邮局的发行工作，气焰十分嚣张。他知道我们去是搞他的问题的，我们一到，他就派人拿了张条子来威胁我们。那张条子写道：“你们留些余地便罢，否则白刀子进红刀子出，不惜以生命相搏。”我们看了以后，冷笑起来。我们已经不是解放前的报花子，再不能给你们打耳光了，有党给我们撑着腰呢！党把你们的靠山国民党反动派都打倒了，还怕你这个小喽罗！后来，我们发动群众并在当地公安部门和司法部门的协助下，终于斗倒了这个小把头。报童、报贩们也都得到了妥善的安置，有些转到了工厂或企业工作，有些吸收进邮局，一部分则回乡生产。受侮辱受迫害的报花子彻底翻身了！
    十年来，我无时无刻不在受着党的教导和培养。解放初期，我做报刊发行工作是不太安心的，由于旧社会的影响，总觉得做报刊发行工作不很光彩，老想换个工作。当我提到这个问题时，党组织就这样教导我：“解放后的报刊发行工作，同你以前所做的工作，本质上是截然不同的。我们的报刊，是宣传真理的最有力的武器，因此作发行工作是最光荣不过了。”有一位首长还把许多革命领袖怎样重视党报发行工作的事迹告诉我，当我知道有些负责同志在白色恐怖时期，为了宣传党的方针，在重庆街头也亲自叫卖过党报的时候，我不禁惭愧得低下了头。不久，又有件事给了我很大的教育。就是浙江邮电管理局选举基层工会委员时，把我也选上了。从这件事情上，我也清楚地认识到，我再也不是旧社会中被人看不起的报花子了。我怎能不激动，我怎能不好好地安下心来工作呢？
    在不安心工作的思想解决以后，我立刻努力钻研业务，作好工作。为了更好地学习苏联报刊发行工作的先进经验，我在1950年起即学习俄文。这些年来，我编辑和翻译了不少有关发行工作的文章发表在“人民邮电”和“发行员”等报刊上，把苏联的先进经验介绍给我们同行。
    现在我的办公地点正在邮政大厦内。从楼窗口望下去，下面就是我昔日被封建把头打耳光的地方。每当我看着那地方时，我的眼镜面便模糊了。我自己也不相信我就是以前站在外面在寒风中瑟瑟发抖的报花子，我已经变成一个新的人了。
