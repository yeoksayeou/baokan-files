Xinhua News Agency, September 25th. The new Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Albania to China, Pëllumb Pëllumbi, accompanied by all diplomatic officials of the embassy, presented his credentials to Chairman Liu Shaoqi this evening.

Present were Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Li Huichuan, Acting Director of the Department of Soviet and Eastern European Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ma Zhenwu, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department.

Ambassador Pëllumbi said in his address: "Close, sincere, and eternal bonds of friendship link the Albanian people and the Chinese people. This friendship is based on the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism, on the common struggle against imperialism and its servants—the modern revisionists, on the close fraternal relations connecting our two countries with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and on the common goal of building a new life. The internationalist assistance that the People's Republic of China has given and continues to give to the People's Republic of Albania is a valuable contribution to our socialist construction cause.

"Our people have always attached great importance to the efforts made by your great country in developing the economy and culture and improving the style of work, especially to the upsurge in establishing people's communes, which has greatly promoted the development of the national economy.

"Your tremendous achievements in industry, agriculture, education, and culture are not only an important factor in guaranteeing the happy and prosperous life of your hardworking and talented people, but also a valuable contribution to strengthening the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding the noble cause of world peace. We are heartily happy for these victories and wish the fraternal Chinese people new and greater achievements in the peaceful construction of their country."

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said in his reply: "Under the correct leadership of the glorious Albanian Labor Party and the government, the heroic and freedom-loving Albanian people have made tremendous achievements in the great cause of socialist construction, and have transformed Albania from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country with modern industry and large-scale cooperative and mechanized agriculture. Now, the Albanian people are smoothly implementing the revised and expanded Second Five-Year Plan, accelerating the pace of socialist construction, and striving to transition from an agricultural-industrial country to an industrial-agricultural country. Albania has made important contributions to consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, defending Marxism-Leninism, criticizing modern revisionism, opposing imperialist aggression, and safeguarding peace in the Balkans and the world. The Chinese people deeply admire and are elated by these achievements and contributions of the fraternal Albanian people.

"In recent years, the profound friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people and their mutual support and cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields have greatly developed. I am convinced that on the common road of building socialism, under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, based on proletarian internationalism, will be increasingly consolidated and developed in the future, and will make new contributions to further strengthening the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the world peace and democratic forces."

    帕里夫蒂大使致颂词说：“紧密的、真挚和永恒的友谊纽带把阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民联结在一起。这一友谊是以不朽的马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则、以反对帝国主义及其奴仆——现代修正主义者的共同斗争、以使我们两国同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭连接的亲密的兄弟关系和建设新生活的共同目标为基础的。中华人民共和国过去和现在给予阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的国际主义的援助，是对我国社会主义建设事业的宝贵贡献。
    “我国人民过去和现在都十分重视你们伟大的国家在发展经济和文化、改进工作作风方面所作的努力，特别重视在建立大大地促进了国民经济发展的人民公社事业中的热潮。
    “你们在工业、农业、教育和文化上的巨大成就不仅是保障你们勤劳和天才的人民的幸福和富裕生活的重要因素，而且也是加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和维护世界和平崇高事业的宝贵贡献。我们为这些胜利而衷心地高兴，并祝兄弟的中国人民在自己国家的和平建设事业中取得新的、更大的成就。”
    刘少奇主席在答词中说：“英勇的爱好自由的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府的正确领导下，在伟大的社会主义建设事业中，取得了巨大的成就，并且已经把阿尔巴尼亚从一个落后的农业国变成一个拥有现代化工业和大规模合作化和机械化农业的农业—工业国。现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民正顺利地执行着修订扩大了的第二个五年计划，加快社会主义建设速度，为从农业—工业国向工业—农业国过渡而奋斗。阿尔巴尼亚在巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、捍卫马克思列宁主义、批判现代修正主义、反对帝国主义侵略和维护巴尔干和世界和平的事业中，都作出了重要的贡献。中国人民对于兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民的这些成就和贡献，深为钦佩，并且感到欢欣鼓舞。
    “近年来，中阿两国人民的深厚友谊和在政治、经济、文化各方面的相互支持和合作，都获得了很大的发展。我深信，在建设社会主义的共同道路上，在马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜下，我们两国建立在无产阶级国际主义基础上的友好和互助合作关系今后必将日益巩固和发展，而且将为进一步增强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界和平民主力量做出新的贡献。”
