    Prague, September 13th (By our Correspondent) – A most modern cement plant with an annual output of 600,000 tons of cement is under construction in Loshkov, twenty kilometers west of Prague. It is one of Czechoslovakia's key construction projects this year. Construction began this spring and is expected to be fully operational by June 1961. It will provide a large amount of raw materials for the country's large-scale capital construction and housing construction.
    Once completed, the Loshkov Cement Plant will have its entire production process automated. The average annual production per worker will reach 1,255 tons, compared to only 970 tons in the United Kingdom, 845 tons in West Germany, and only 1,200 tons in the United States. The cement plant uses the most advanced dry process production method in the world. This method has so far only been adopted in a very few countries.
    Currently, Czechoslovak construction workers are working hard on this construction site. Since the start of construction, the workers have successfully completed their plans every month. They have launched a vigorous socialist emulation drive to save steel and wood and to overfulfill their construction tasks.
    So far, the construction workers have saved 350 tons of reinforcing steel.
    On this construction site, young workers are a vibrant force, and many young men and women workers have participated in the construction of this project.

    捷正建设一现代化水泥厂
    全部生产过程将自动化
    本报布拉格13日电　在布拉格以西二十公里的洛什科夫地方正在兴建一座最现代化的年产六十万吨水泥的水泥厂，它是捷克斯洛伐克今年基本建设重点工程之一。这个工厂是今年春天动工的，预计到1961年6月就将全部投入生产。它将为国家大规模进行的基本建设和住房建筑提供大量原料。
    洛什科夫水泥厂建成后，全部生产过程都将是自动化的。每个工人每年的平均生产量将达到一千二百五十五吨，而英国只有九百七十吨，西德八百四十五吨，美国也只有一千二百吨。水泥厂采用目前世界上最先进的干燥法进行生产。这种方法到现在为止还只在极少几个国家中采用。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克的建筑工人们正紧张地在这个工地上劳动。从开工以来，工人们每月都胜利地完成了计划，他们为节约钢材和木材以及超额完成建筑任务而展开了轰轰烈烈的社会主义竞赛。
    到现在为止，建筑工人们已节约了三百五十吨钢筋。
    在这个工地上，青年工人是一支活跃的力量，不少男女青年工人参加了这项工程的建筑。
