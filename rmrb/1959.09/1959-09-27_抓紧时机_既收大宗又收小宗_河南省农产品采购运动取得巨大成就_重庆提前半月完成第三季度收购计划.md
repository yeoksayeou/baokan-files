Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 24th: The agricultural product procurement campaign launched by employees of the commercial and grain departments of Henan Province to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation has achieved great success.

The province's third-quarter procurement plans for cotton and flue-cured tobacco have been overfulfilled by 40% and 18.4% respectively, more than half a month ahead of schedule. Compared with the acquisition volume in the same period last year, cotton has increased by more than five times, and flue-cured tobacco has increased by nearly two times. As of the 20th, the province's requisitioned autumn grain had increased by more than 920 million catties compared with the amount put into storage in the same period last year, and the acquisition of hemp and pigs has also increased significantly. More than 80% of the autumn grain requisitioned and stored is of medium to high quality. The acquired cotton is white and long in fiber, with a high ginning outturn rate. After key trial ginnings, every 100 catties of seed cotton yielded one to two catties more lint than last year. The quality of flue-cured tobacco is generally also better than in previous years.

While strengthening the procurement of major agricultural and sideline products, the commercial departments, adhering to the principle of "acquiring both large quantities and small quantities, and comprehensively overfulfilling the quarterly plan," have acquired a large number of local and special products. The total value of local and special product purchases in the province in early September increased by 1.6 times compared with early August. As of now, the three special districts of Luoyang, Nanyang, and Xinyang have completed the third-quarter acquisition plan for local and special products; twelve counties and cities have completed the annual procurement plan for local and special products.

The call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has greatly encouraged the employees on the commercial and grain front in Henan Province. From August 26 to September 8, the commercial system of the whole province held telephone conferences, on-site meetings, appraisal meetings, and oath-taking rallies from top to bottom to combat right-leaning tendencies and boost morale. Employees wrote more than 848,000 big-character posters, letters of determination, and letters of guarantee, and issued 75,000 letters of initiative, challenge, and response. Employees engaged in procurement work expressed their determination to conscientiously implement policies, take into account the interests of the state, the commune, and the members, improve acquisition methods, and dedicate new labor achievements to the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation. During this period, a vigorous atmosphere emerged in the province's agricultural product acquisition work, and the acquisition progress was greatly accelerated. The acquisition volume of cotton exceeded the quarterly plan by September 18. The acquisition progress of hemp has always been slow. By the end of August, the province's hemp acquisition volume was still less than the same period last year. After entering September, the situation changed greatly. As of September 15, the cumulative acquisition volume had increased by 20% compared with the same period last year.

In the agricultural product procurement campaign, employees of the commercial and grain departments more actively and consciously relied on the leadership and support of party committees at all levels, and implemented a system of reporting to the party committee three times a day (reporting progress with tables, reporting the situation in writing, and reporting problems verbally) and reporting three times on one matter (reporting before the event, reporting during the action, and reporting after the event). Under the unified leadership of the Party, they vigorously publicized and implemented policies, seized appropriate opportunities to organize the masses to carry out a concentrated sales campaign, and at the same time, twisted into a rope with all relevant departments, cooperating and supporting each other. The communes and production brigades guaranteed to actively sell agricultural products; the commercial and grain departments guaranteed to receive them as soon as they arrived, facilitating the masses; the transportation departments guaranteed to transport them as they were received; and the banks guaranteed to supply funds in a timely manner. In order to do the acquisition work meticulously and well, the commercial and grain departments, on the one hand, vigorously publicized the policy of high quality and high price to the masses, and mobilized the masses to pick, dry, bake, and sell cotton and flue-cured tobacco separately, and to dry and winnow the grain; on the other hand, they organized thousands of farmer graders to grade on the spot and in the team, and then re-inspect them after they were transported to the acquisition station or processing plant, and then weigh, store, settle, and pay, generally achieving accurate grades and substantial quantities.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th: Commercial employees in Chongqing seized favorable opportunities to launch a mass acquisition campaign, completing the third-quarter acquisition plan in one fell swoop fifteen days ahead of schedule.

The Party Central Committee's call to combat right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy has greatly encouraged commercial employees. Many units actively expanded their purchase plans, seized the opportunity when a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy was rising in the current industrial sector and agricultural, sideline, local, and special products began to be on the market in large quantities, launched a mass acquisition campaign, and greatly increased the volume of commodity purchases. The city's commercial departments' purchase volume in mid-August increased by 82.2% compared with the first ten days of the month, and the last ten days of the month increased by 95.44% compared with the middle ten days of the month. Entering September, the increase was even more significant. By September 15, the third-quarter purchase plan had been overfulfilled by 2.59%. The acquisition volume of major commodities has increased significantly compared with the same period last year.

In the acquisition campaign, the commercial departments continued to carry forward the spirit of communist cooperation in the Great Leap Forward last year, actively participated in production, assisted production departments to overcome difficulties, and increased sources of goods from the development of production. Ten companies and procurement and supply stations, including chemical industry, native products, textiles, department stores, hardware, electrical appliances, medical supplies, and cultural supplies, supplied industrial departments with various raw materials, materials, machinery and equipment, product samples, and technical information, assisted in the restoration and trial production of more than 260 new products, and organized factories to mutually adjust materials. When a drought occurred in the rural suburbs, commercial employees actively supported farmers in fighting the drought. More than 10,000 employees from the municipal-level commercial departments participated in the drought resistance, and also supplied 325 sets of various drainage and irrigation equipment, 7,100 tons of pesticides and fertilizers, and purchased more than 200,000 catties of various vegetable seeds from inside and outside the province, enabling farmers to rush to plant vegetables in time. Therefore, even during the severe drought, the supply level of half a catty of vegetables per person per day was basically guaranteed.

    河南省农产品采购运动取得巨大成就
    重庆提前半月完成第三季度收购计划
    新华社郑州24日电　河南省商业、粮食部门职工为向建国十周年献礼而开展的农产品采购运动，取得了巨大成就。
    全省第三季度的棉花、烤烟采购计划，已经提前半个多月分别超额40％和18.4％完成；与去年同期的收购量相比，棉花增加五倍多，烤烟增加近两倍。到20日止，全省征购的秋粮比去年同期的入库量增加九亿二千多万斤，麻、猪的收购量也显著增加。征购入仓的秋粮中，上中等粮食占80％以上；收购的棉花色白绒长，衣分率高，经过重点试轧，每百斤籽棉轧出的皮棉比去年多一斤到二斤；烤烟质量一般也比往年好。
    在加强主要农副产品采购工作的同时，商业部门本着“既收大宗，又收小宗，全面超额完成季度计划”的方针，收购了大量的土特产品。全省9月上旬的土特产品收购总值比8月上旬增加了一点六倍。到现在为止，已经完成第三季度土特产品收购计划的有洛阳、南阳、信阳三个专区；完成了全年土特产品采购计划的有十二个县市。
    党的八届八中全会的号召，给河南省商业、粮食战线上的职工以很大鼓舞。从8月26日到9月8日，全省商业系统从上到下召开电话会、现场会、评比会、誓师大会，反右倾，鼓干劲；职工们写出大字报、决心书、保证书八十四万八千多张，发出倡议书、挑战书、应战书七万五千多份。担任采购工作的职工表示要认真贯彻政策，兼顾国家、公社、社员三者的利益，改进收购方法，以新的劳动成果，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。在这期间，全省的农产品收购工作就出现了蓬蓬勃勃的气象，收购进度大大加快。棉花的收购量到9月18日就超过了季度计划。麻类收购进度一向迟缓，到8月底全省的麻类收购量还少于去年同期，进入9月后情况大有改变，到9月15日累计，收购量已比去年同期增加20％。
    在农产品采购运动中，商业、粮食部门的职工更加积极主动地依靠各级党委的领导和支持，实行向党委一日三汇报（报表汇报进度、文字汇报情况、口头汇报问题）和一事三汇报（事前汇报、行动中汇报、事后汇报）的制度。在党的统一领导下，他们大力宣传和贯彻政策，抓住适当时机组织群众开展突击交售运动，同时和各有关部门拧成一股绳，互相协作支援。公社、生产大队保证积极出售农产品；商业、粮食部门保证随到随收，便利群众；交通运输部门保证随收随运；银行保证及时供应资金。为了把收购工作做得又细又好，商业和粮食部门一面向群众大力宣传优质优价政策，发动群众对棉花、烤烟分摘、分晒、分烤、分售，把粮食晒干扬净；一面组织成千上万的农民验级员就地就队验级，运到收购站或加工厂后再行复验，然后过秤、入库、结算、付款，一般都作到了等级准确，数量落实。
    新华社重庆24日电　重庆市商业职工抓紧有利时机，开展群众性的收购运动，提前十五天一气呵成地完成了第三季度收购计划。
    党中央关于反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的号召，给商业职工以极大的鼓舞。许多单位积极扩大购进计划，抓紧在当前工业部门掀起增产节约运动新高潮和农、副、土、特产品开始大量上市的时机，开展群众性的收购运动，使商品收购量大大增加。全市商业部门8月中旬的购进额比上旬增加82.2％，下旬又比中旬增加95.44％。进入9月份，增加得更显著，到9月15日就超额2.59％完成了第三季度的购进计划，主要商品的收购量比去年同期都有较大的增长。
    在收购运动中，商业部门继续发扬去年大跃进中大搞共产主义协作的精神，积极参与生产，协助生产部门克服困难，从发展生产中增加货源。化工、土产、纺织、百货、五金交电器材、医药、文化用品等十个公司和采购供应站，供应工业部门各种原料、材料、机器设备、产品样品和技术资料，协助恢复和试制成功二百六十多种新产品，组织各工厂互相调剂物资。当市郊农村发生旱象的时候，商业职工积极支援农民抗旱。仅市级商业部门参加抗旱的职工就达一万多人次，还供应各种排灌设备三百二十五台，农药、肥料七千一百多吨，并到省内外收购各种菜种二十万多斤，使农民及时抢种上蔬菜。因此，即使在特大干旱期间，也基本上保证了每人每天半斤蔬菜的供应水平。
