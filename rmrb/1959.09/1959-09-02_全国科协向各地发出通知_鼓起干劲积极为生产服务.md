The notice said that the All-China Science and Technology Association requires science and technology associations at all levels to, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, warmly respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, overcome all right-leaning conservative ideas, continue to exert full effort, mobilize all members, and connect with the broad masses to actively carry out scientific and technological activities, promote the current mass movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy, and fight heroically to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan.

The notice pointed out that science and technology associations at all levels must be clear that the primary task of the Science Association's work is to serve the current local production. To this end, science and technology associations at all levels must actively participate in the production increase and economy practice movements on all fronts of industry, agriculture, and transportation, and socialist labor competitions. Currently, in the production of various industrial and mining enterprises, the first priority is to focus on the production and conservation of raw materials, materials, fuels, and electricity. In agricultural production, the struggle against drought and flood, and the elimination of pests, are even more urgent tasks. In this decisive and great battle, science and technology associations at all levels must seize the precious opportunity in the next four months, especially the next month or so, mobilize all members and connect with the broad masses to contribute all their strength to carrying out mass scientific and technological activities.

In order to ensure the complete realization of this major task, the notice requires science and technology associations at all levels to take measures and act quickly under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. Science and technology associations at all levels should earnestly implement the Party's mass line work methods in all activities, give full play to the characteristics of mass scientific and technological organizations, promote various professional organizations of various societies and grassroots science associations, mobilize scientific and technological forces, and, according to the needs of current production tasks, do everything possible to extensively and deeply carry out scientific and technological professional activities, promote the cause of masses running science and the popularization of scientific and technological knowledge on a larger scale; and in their work, take the initiative to cooperate with the work of relevant business departments and trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and women's federations, to better promote the communist style of collective collaboration. Science and technology associations in each province, city, and autonomous region should, in conjunction with the current practical work, delve into key points, go deep into the grassroots, earnestly summarize the working experience of science and technology associations at all levels in serving the local production at that time, commend the advanced, establish pacesetters, and further promote the work of science and technology associations at all levels more extensively and deeply.

    本报讯　中国科学技术协会，为了响应中共八届八中全会的号召，反右倾、鼓干劲，今年提前完成第二个五年计划主要指标，特向各省、市、自治区科学技术协会发出通知。
    通知说，全国科协要求各级科协组织在各级党委的领导下，热烈响应中共中央的号召，克服一切右倾保守思想，继续鼓足干劲，动员全体会员，联系广大群众积极开展科学技术活动，推动当前以增产节约为中心的群众运动，为完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划而英勇奋斗。
    通知指出，各级科协组织必需明确，科协工作的首要任务就是为当前当地的生产服务，为此，各级科协组织必需积极投入工业、农业、运输业各个战线上的增产节约运动，和社会主义的劳动竞赛。当前在各个工矿企业的生产中首先是抓紧原料、材料、燃料、电力的生产和节约，在农业生产中，抗旱防涝、灭虫的斗争，更是十分紧急的任务。各级科协组织必须在这决定性的伟大战斗中，抓紧今后四个月，特别是抓紧今后一个多月的宝贵时机，动员全体会员联系广大群众在开展群众性科学技术活动方面贡献出一切力量。
    为了保证这一重大任务的彻底实现，通知要求各级科协应在各级党委的领导下，迅速采取措施行动起来。各级科协组织应在各项活动中认真贯彻党的群众路线的工作方法，充分发挥科学技术群众团体的特点，推动各学会即基层科协的各种专业组织，动员科学技术力量，根据当前生产任务的需要，千方百计广泛深入地开展科学技术专业活动，更大规模地推动群众办科学的事业和科学技术知识的普及宣传；并在工作中主动配合各有关业务部门和工会、共青团妇联等方面的工作，更好地发扬集体协作的共产主义风格。各省、市、自治区科协应当结合当前的实际工作，深入重点，深入基层，认真总结各级科协组织在为当时当地生产服务的工作经验，表扬先进，树立标兵，进一步更广泛深入地推动各级科协的工作。
