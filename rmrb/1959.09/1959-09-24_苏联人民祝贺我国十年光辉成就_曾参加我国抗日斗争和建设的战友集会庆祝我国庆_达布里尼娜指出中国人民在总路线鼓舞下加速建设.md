Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 22nd: A group of Soviet comrades who participated in the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan and socialist construction, together with Chinese students and travelers in Moscow, held an evening party on the evening of the 22nd to warmly celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of China. The party was sponsored by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the House of Friendship with the Peoples of Foreign Countries. Hundreds of people attended the party, which was filled with a cordial atmosphere. Many Soviet comrades spoke at the party. Arkhipov, Vice Chairman of the Soviet State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, who once served as the chief advisor of the Soviet Economic Experts of the State Council of our country, used specific figures and facts to illustrate the brilliant achievements China has made in all aspects since its founding. He said that in the past ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have creatively applied Marxism-Leninism, basically completed the socialist revolution, and successfully completed the First Five-Year Plan. Ten years is a short time, but the Chinese people's construction speed is very fast, and the achievements are great. The Soviet people are sincerely happy for the achievements of their Chinese friends. He wished the Chinese people greater achievements in future socialist construction.

    Lieutenant General Slyusarev, a Soviet hero who helped our country resist the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan, recalled the difficult years of the past and congratulated the Chinese people on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with great joy.

    Balashov, workshop director of the Moscow Cable Factory, who helped our country build the Shenyang Cable Factory, said that when we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of China, we are sincerely happy for every leap forward made by the Chinese people.

    At the party, Xilin, a famous engineer who helped our country build the Yangtze River Bridge, talked about the construction of Wuhan City after liberation and the impressions the Chinese people left on him. He cited the Wuhan citizens' victory over the extraordinarily large flood in 1954 and the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge as examples to praise the Chinese people's spirit of diligence, bravery, and unity.

    Academician Zhukov-Verezhnikov of the Academy of Medical Sciences once went to China to help eliminate the plague. He said that the results achieved by the close cooperation between medical workers in the Soviet Union and China are great. No force in the world can stop the Chinese people from advancing victoriously.

    Zhang Weilie, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, also spoke at the meeting. Literary and artistic programs and films were also performed at the meeting.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 22nd: Dabrinina, a member of the Presidium of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said at an evening party held in the Leningrad District of Moscow on the 22nd to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country that the general line for building socialism and the "walking on two legs" policy determined by the Chinese Communist Party are mobilizing the entire Chinese people to build socialism rapidly. The great leap forward in China's economic construction in 1958 has achieved brilliant victories. The Soviet people are extremely happy for the great victory of the Chinese people.

    She said that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which was held not long ago, severely criticized right-leaning sentiments and determined that the policy of continuing the leap forward in construction will continue in the future. The new combat tasks put forward by the Chinese people will surely be completed ahead of schedule.

    Hundreds of workers and students from the Leningrad District participated in this celebration party held by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at the Chkalov Factory Club. Belke, a worker at the Chkalov Factory, spoke on behalf of all the factory workers at the meeting. He said that we fully support Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the request to quickly restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. Khrushchev's opinion is the opinion of all the Soviet people. Imperialism's opposition to the great Chinese people is doomed to failure.

    Staff members of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union also attended the party.
