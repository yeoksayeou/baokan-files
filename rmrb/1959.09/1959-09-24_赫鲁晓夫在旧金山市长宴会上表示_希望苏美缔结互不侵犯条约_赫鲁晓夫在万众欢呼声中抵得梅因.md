Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd, TASS, September 23rd: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, stated in a speech at a banquet held by the Mayor of San Francisco and local business representatives on the 21st, "Gentlemen! Your place is beautiful, your city of San Francisco is magnificent. The waters of the Pacific Ocean, which lap the shores of your city, also wash the coast of the Soviet Far East."

Although I was unable to enter your city by sea, I know that the Golden Gate of the city is open. I believe that the day is not far off when this Golden Gate will hospitably open to Soviet ships, which will bring what you need to your country, and American freighters will also pass through this gate to Soviet seaports (applause).

I have said more than once that we are visiting the United States with sincerity. We only want to achieve one goal: to live in peace and friendship with you and the people of other countries. I think the esteemed Californians present will share the same feelings and wishes as we do (applause).

Khrushchev said that Americans who have been to the Soviet Union bring back all kinds of views on our country and our lives. But they all confirm that the words "peace" and "friendship" can be heard everywhere in our country. We know very well what war means, so although we are very strong, we do not want to subject mankind to another war fraught with disaster and devastating destruction.

In order to rationally resolve the mature issues as soon as possible, it is necessary to abandon all prejudices and hostility. This is how the Soviet Union treats all issues on which there are differences. The Soviet Union does not pursue any selfish interests. All we hope for is that people anywhere on Earth will not be threatened by war (sustained applause).

Khrushchev said that the text of my speech, prepared for this grand gathering with such a representative presence, is finished. But if you don't object, I would like to say a little more.

Khrushchev then spoke about his impressions of visiting San Francisco. He said that he thanked the workers of the longshoremen's union, as well as the owners of the transportation companies or contractors (I don't know what you call these people here), for inviting me to their place. It was a pleasure to have a cordial conversation in the council of this union.

Khrushchev said that he saw smiles on the faces of the San Franciscans who welcomed him, and saw the expression of kindness and friendly feelings (applause).

He said that the visit to the computer factory gave us great pleasure. We were warmly welcomed. The factory we visited produces computers. Currently, the production of computers is confidential, but I think that before long, this secret will be available to everyone, as long as this secret can bring them benefits (lively atmosphere, applause).

Speaking of secrets, by the way. I remember when we were preparing to launch a rocket for the first time, the scientists invited members of the government to let us see the rocket. We walked around the rocket, looked here, looked there, looked at it this way, looked at it that way (joyful atmosphere). But how it worked, or how it was "eaten," we didn't know. I think such "secrets" can be shown to many people: they will also look left and right, touch here and touch there, but understand nothing (lively atmosphere, applause).

Khrushchev expressed his gratitude for the hospitality and welcome he received.

Khrushchev continued, "I feel it is my duty to say a few words here in San Francisco about your neighbor—the city of Los Angeles and its citizens" (lively atmosphere). I want to say some good things about these citizens.

We were very satisfied with the meeting with the citizens of Los Angeles. But an unexpected thing happened there: someone told me that when we were taking a sightseeing tour of the city, the police chief's car was in front of us. Someone, whether too clever or not clever enough, threw tomatoes, perhaps even good tomatoes, but this tomato hit the police chief's car (full of lively atmosphere). As a result, the police chief showed his authority and deprived us of the pleasure of visiting "Disneyland" as arranged in our visit plan (laughter, applause in the hall).

I thank the police chief for his concern for my safety, but I think he took this matter too seriously. One should take it calmly. I am sure that if we really went to visit "Disneyland," nothing bad would have happened there except good things. However, there are always superstitious people! Even the great Russian poet Pushkin had this situation. It is said that once in winter, when he was going out on a sleigh, a black cat crossed the road, and for this reason, he went home. But this was a long time ago. Now, we should not stop before a "black cat," but should continue to move forward according to the original plan. I think everything will be smooth (applause).

Khrushchev finally said, Mr. Christopher, I would have been happy to invite you to Moscow as well, but I don't know whether my invitation will be beneficial or detrimental to you in the upcoming election. This is a very complicated issue for me. Therefore, I extend an invitation to everyone present, to all the residents of this beautiful, prosperous, and sunny city of San Francisco, to welcome you to our Soviet Union, to our Moscow, we will be very happy to receive you (sustained applause). We have a saying: who has not been to Russia has not seen the world. Please come and see our country, maybe you will like it too (stormy applause).

At the end of the reception, San Francisco Mayor Christopher presented Khrushchev with a souvenir—a gavel made of redwood. Khrushchev expressed his gratitude when accepting the gift, saying:

Our country does not use gavels in general meetings or formal conferences. So I don't know where I can use it.

I hope to use the first strike of this gavel to promote the agreement between U.S. President Eisenhower and me on signing an agreement, concluding a treaty of peace, non-aggression, and cooperation, and it would be best to conclude a treaty of friendship between our two countries. This will bring great benefits to our two countries and to the cause of consolidating world peace (stormy, sustained applause).

It would also be great if an agreement could be reached on disarmament, thereby forever stopping the arms race, so that mankind would not be threatened by war and could live in peace and friendship with each other.

Gentlemen, if this can be done, then I would be the luckiest person! (Stormy, sustained applause)

Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd, TASS, Des Moines: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and his entourage arrived in Des Moines, the capital of Iowa, at 13:40 on the 22nd from San Francisco.

Governor Loveless and Des Moines Mayor Ellis and other officials welcomed Khrushchev at the airport.

Governor Loveless expressed when welcoming Khrushchev that he hoped that Khrushchev would see the achievements of Iowa, visit some residences, factories, and schools, if time permits.

Khrushchev said in his reply that he was very happy to come to Iowa. He said, "Our people know a little about Iowa, so we really want to see how the people of Iowa live. We know that you rank first in the United States in corn production. We are competing with you, and I think this will be very beneficial." Khrushchev expressed his gratitude for the enthusiastic welcome and hoped that the meetings and discussions could promote friendship between the people and help ensure peace.

Khrushchev and his party headed to the city of Des Moines. All along the way from the airport to the city, there were large groups of residents welcoming Khrushchev.

As soon as you leave the airport, you can immediately see signs written in Russian: "Comrade Khrushchev, let us work together towards world peace. Ms. Logner." Further away is a group of students. They are holding signs: "Live and work in peace." Before the guests arrived, the residents of Des Moines had been waiting on the streets for a long time. Tens of thousands of people welcomed the head of the Soviet government. Everywhere there were welcoming slogans and friendly smiles. People stood on the sidewalks, on balconies, and even on rooftops.

The cars of the Soviet guests drove to the "Fort Des Moines" Hotel, where Khrushchev would stay during his stay in Des Moines.

At the entrance of the hotel, Khrushchev was once again welcomed by tens of thousands of citizens. When the head of the Soviet government appeared, a burst of applause and welcoming sounds rang out.

Someone asked Khrushchev: What impressed him the most about the United States. Khrushchev replied that it was the American people, because they, like the Soviet people, are committed to peace.

Then, Khrushchev said that when he passed through the streets of Des Moines, he saw a sign that read: "We do not always agree with your opinions, but we welcome you." Khrushchev said that these were very wise words. It is possible to disagree with each other's opinions, but the United States and the Soviet Union should live in peace and friendship.

Someone asked whether annual meetings between Soviet and American leaders could help peace, Khrushchev replied that meetings and talks are much more useful than exchanging sometimes unpleasant notes. He said that perhaps it is necessary to meet not just once a year, but twice.

Khrushchev thanked the residents of Des Moines for their warm welcome. At this time, another burst of applause rang out.

Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd, TASS, Des Moines, September 23rd: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and his entourage visited a meat factory not far from Des Moines, Iowa, yesterday afternoon. Khrushchev was very interested in the factory's production organization and equipment. The workers warmly welcomed the head of the Soviet government. Subsequently, Khrushchev and his entourage visited an agricultural machinery manufacturing plant.

Khrushchev and his entourage returned to Des Moines after visiting the factory.

On the way to the hotel, tens of thousands of Americans welcomed Khrushchev. (Attached picture)

    赫鲁晓夫在旧金山市长宴会上表示
    希望苏美缔结互不侵犯条约
    赫鲁晓夫在万众欢呼声中抵得梅因
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社23日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫21日在旧金山市长同当地实业界代表举行的宴会上发表演说说，先生们！你们的地方很美丽，你们的旧金山市很壮观。拍击着你们城市堤岸的太平洋的海水也冲刷着苏联远东的海岸。
    虽然我没有能够从海上进入你们的城市，但是我知道，城市的金门是开着的。我相信，这样的日子不会很远：那时这个金门将好客地为苏联轮船敞开，这些轮船将把你们所需要的东西运到你们国家，而美国的货轮也将通过这个门驶往苏联的海港（掌声）。
    我说过不止一次，我们是抱着真心诚意到美国来访问的。我们只想达到一个目的：同你们和其他国家的人民和平友好地生活。我想，在座的敬爱的加利福尼亚人将同我们有同样的感情和愿望（掌声）。
    赫鲁晓夫说，到过苏联的美国人把各式各样的对于我们国家和我国生活的看法带到这里来。但是他们都证实，在我们国家到处都可听到“和平”和“友谊”的字眼。我们很清楚，战争意味着什么，因此，虽然我们很强大，但我们并不希望使人类再遇到灾难重重、破坏惨重的战争。
    为了尽快地合理解决已成熟的问题，必须放弃一切偏见和敌意。苏联人正是这样对待一切彼此有分歧的问题的。苏联不追求任何一己之利。我们所希望的只是：地球上任何地方的人们都不受到战争的威胁（经久不息的掌声）。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我为这个如此富有代表性的隆重聚会所准备的讲稿已经完了。但是，如果你们不反对，我想再讲一些。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到他访问旧金山的观感。他说，我向码头工人工会的工作者，以及组织运输的脚行老板或包工头（我不知道你们这里怎样称呼这些人）表示感谢，感谢他们邀请我到他们那里。在这个工会的理事会中进行亲切的谈话使我感到快慰。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他在欢迎他的旧金山人的脸上看见了微笑，看到了善良的、友好的感情的流露（掌声）。
    他说，到计算机工厂的访问使我们得到了很大的快慰。我们受到了很热烈的欢迎。我们参观过的工厂是生产计算机的。目前，计算机的生产是保密的，但是，我想，要不了多久，这种秘密就能为大家所利用，只要这秘密能给他们带来好处（全场活跃、掌声）。
     顺便谈谈秘密。记得，当我们第一次准备发射火箭时，科学家邀请了政府成员，要我们看看火箭。我们在这个火箭附近走来走去，这里看看，那里看看，这样瞧瞧，那样瞧瞧（欢乐的活跃）。但是它怎样行动，或者说，怎样吃法，我们不知道。我想，这样的“秘密”可以给许多人看：他们也会左看看，右看看，这边摸摸，那边摸摸，可是什么也不懂（活跃，掌声）。
    赫鲁晓夫对他受到的款待和欢迎表示感谢。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我认为自己有职责在你们旧金山这里就你们的邻居——洛杉矶市和它的市民说几句话（场内活跃）。我要对这些市民说些好话。
    我们很满意同洛杉矶市民的会见。但是在那里发生了一桩意外的事情：有人对我说，当我们坐车观光市容时，警察局长的汽车走在我们前面。有一个人不知是聪明过分，还是不够聪明，竟抛掷西红柿，也许甚至是很好的西红柿呢，不过，这个西红柿打在警察局长的汽车上（全场活跃）。于是，警察局长显示了他的权威，剥夺了我们的访问计划中安排好的参观“迪斯尼乐园”的兴致（场内笑声、掌声）。
    我向这位警察局长感谢他关心我的安全，但是，我认为，他对这件事看得过分严重了。应该泰然处之。我确信，如果我们真的去参观“迪斯尼乐园”的话，在那里除了好事之外，不会发生什么坏事。不过，迷信的人总是有的！甚至像伟大的俄国诗人普希金也曾有过这种情况。据说，有一次在冬天，当他坐雪橇出去的时候，一只黑猫横跨过道路，由于这个缘故，他回家了。但是，这是很远以前的事。现在，我们不应当在“黑猫”之前停步不前，应当按原订计划继续前进。我想，一切都会是顺利的（掌声）。
      赫鲁晓夫最后说，克里斯托弗先生，我本应很愉快地也邀请您到莫斯科的，但不知道，在即将到来的选举中我的邀请对您是有利还是不利。这对我来说是个很复杂的问题。因此，我向在场的各位、向这个美好的、繁荣的、阳光灿烂的旧金山市的全体居民发出邀请，欢迎你们到我们苏联，到我们莫斯科去，我们将很高兴接待你们（经久不息的掌声）。我们有句俗话：谁没有到过俄国，谁就没有见过世面。请去看看我们的国家，说不定你们也会喜欢它的（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    在招待会结束时，旧金山市长克里斯托弗先生送给赫鲁晓夫一个纪念品——红木做的主席槌。赫鲁晓夫在接受礼物时表示谢意说：
    我们国家在一般集会或者正式会议上都不用主席槌。因此我不知道，什么地方我能用上它。
    我希望用这把小槌的第一击来促使美国总统艾森豪威尔先生和我之间能够谈妥签订协议，缔结和平、互不侵犯、合作条约，而最好是缔结我们两国的友好条约。这会给我们两国，给巩固世界和平的事业带来很大的好处（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    如果能就裁军问题达成协议，从而永远停止军备竞赛，使人类不受战争威胁，使他们能够和平友好相处，那也是很好的。
    各位先生，如果能够做到这一点，那我就是最幸运的人了！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    新华社23日讯　塔斯社得梅因讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和随行人员22日十三时四十分从旧金山到达衣阿华州的首府得梅因。
    州长洛夫勒斯和得梅因市长艾利斯及其他官员在机场欢迎赫鲁晓夫。
    洛夫勒斯州长在欢迎赫鲁晓夫的时候表示，希望赫鲁晓夫在时间允许的条件下看看衣阿华州的成就，参观一些住宅、工厂、学校。
    赫鲁晓夫致答词说，他到衣阿华州来感到很愉快。他说，“我们人民对衣阿华州有一些了解，所以我们很希望来看看衣阿华州的人民是怎样生活的。我们知道，你们在生产玉蜀黍方面占美国首位。我们在同你们竞赛，我认为，这会有很大好处。”赫鲁晓夫对热情的欢迎词表示感谢，并且希望会晤和座谈能促进人民之间的友谊，有助于保证和平。
    赫鲁晓夫一行前往得梅因市。从机场到市内一路都有一大批一大批的居民欢迎赫鲁晓夫。
    一出飞机场，马上就可以看到用俄文写的标语牌：“赫鲁晓夫同志，共同走向世界和平。洛格纳女士”。再远一点是一群学生。他们手上拿着标语牌：“在和平中生活和劳动”。在客人们到达以前，得梅因的居民早就在大街上等候了。有数万人欢迎苏联政府首脑。到处都是高呼欢迎的口号和亲切的微笑。人们站在人行道上，阳台上，甚至站在屋顶上。
    苏联客人的汽车开到了“福特·得梅因”饭店，赫鲁晓夫逗留在得梅因期间将住在那里。
    在饭店门口，赫鲁晓夫又受到了成千上万市民的欢迎。当苏联政府首脑出现的时候，响起了一阵掌声和欢迎的声音。
    有人问赫鲁晓夫：美国给他印象最深的是什么。赫鲁晓夫回答说，是美国人民，因为他们同苏联人民一样，致力于和平。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫说，经过得梅因街道的时候，他看到了一块标语牌，上面写着：“我们不总是同意您的意见，但是我们欢迎您”。赫鲁晓夫说，这是很明智的话。可以不同意对方的意见，但是美国与苏联应该和平友好相处。
    有人问，苏美领导人之间每年会晤能否有助于和平呢，赫鲁晓夫回答说，会晤与会谈比起互换有时是不愉快的照会来要有用得多。他说，可能，一年需要会晤不止一次，而是两次。
    赫鲁晓夫感谢得梅因居民的热烈欢迎。这时又响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社得梅因23日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员昨天下午参观了离衣阿华州得梅因市不远的肉类工厂。赫鲁晓夫对工厂生产组织和设备很感兴趣。工人热烈欢迎苏联政府首脑。随后，赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员参观了农业机器制造厂。
    赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员参观工厂后回到得梅因。
