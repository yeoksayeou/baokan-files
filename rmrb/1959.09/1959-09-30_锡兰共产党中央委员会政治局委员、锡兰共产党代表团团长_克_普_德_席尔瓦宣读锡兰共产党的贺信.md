K. P. de Silva, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon and Head of the Delegation of the Communist Party of Ceylon, Reads the Congratulatory Letter from the Communist Party of Ceylon

Dear Comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

On this joyous occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon and all its members extend warm respect and heartfelt congratulations to the Central Committee of the great Communist Party of China and all its members.

Dear Comrades, through you, we extend our greetings to the people of all ethnic groups in your great country, and offer our sincere congratulations to them, who are building socialism in China with boundless enthusiasm and vitality.

The tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is an extremely important event in the history of Asia and the world. In the past ten years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of their Communist Party, have created construction miracles and changed the face of your vast country. China's current unity surpasses any era in your long history. China has become a powerful force for peace and friendship among nations. The great leap forward in economy and culture has ended the backwardness of the past and is now advancing China along the road to becoming a great socialist country, whose production in all aspects will surpass Britain and other capitalist bastions in a very short historical period.

The great achievements of the Chinese people in the first decade after the establishment of your People's Republic once again prove the superiority of the socialist system. This is another vivid demonstration that Marxism-Leninism is universally applicable. Your glorious victory refutes in fact the bourgeois thinkers' nonsense that Marxism-Leninism is outdated and not applicable to Asia.

Although many countries in Asia won political independence before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, none of them has been able to achieve the unprecedented progress that China has made in the past ten years. None of them could even dream of such a rapid pace of development as yours. This is because you are marching along the socialist road, and your political leadership and national leadership are in the hands of the working people, led by a great Communist Party that resolutely defends Marxism-Leninism.

Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people could not have achieved such amazing victories. Life itself has confirmed that your Party's general line is correct.

Our Party and all the people of Ceylon deeply cherish the long-standing and solid friendship between the people of Ceylon and China. The warm welcome given to Comrade Zhou Enlai and other government leaders who visited Ceylon, as well as the friendly reception given to delegations from your country, prove this. The people of Ceylon attach great importance to the trade agreements between our two countries, which have helped us in our difficult times and are a constant source of strength for our national economy. We are grateful for China's generous economic assistance to Ceylon.

In order to undermine the unity of the Asian people against colonialism and their common efforts to safeguard peace, the imperialists and other reactionaries are doing everything possible to provoke and attempt to undermine the traditional friendship between the people of these countries and China. To cover up their own aggressive plots against Asia, they slander China and try to portray your country as an "aggressor." Our Party is convinced that the people of Asian countries will not be fooled by the imperialists' tricks and will resolutely defeat those who employ them. Friendship with China is essential for the people of Asian countries to win the struggle against imperialism and for peace and happiness, and the people of Asian countries will never forget this.

On the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of Ceylon wishes the Communist Party of China and the people of all ethnic groups in China all the best in the future. We are confident that the Chinese people will implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan, originally scheduled for completion in 1962, in the coming year.

Long live the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

May the friendship between the people of Ceylon and China and the fraternal unity between our two parties grow stronger day by day!

Long live the great People's Republic of China!

Long live the struggle of the world for peace, freedom and socialism!

Long live the unity of fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties!

Long live the invincible cause of Marxism-Leninism!

    锡兰共产党中央委员会政治局委员、锡兰共产党代表团团长
    克·普·德·席尔瓦宣读锡兰共产党的贺信中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    在中华人民共和国建立十周年这个愉快的节日，锡兰共产党中央委员会和全体党员向伟大的中国共产党的中央委员会和全体党员致以热烈的敬意和衷心的祝贺。
    亲爱的同志们，我们通过你们向你们伟大国家的各族人民致敬，并致以诚挚的祝贺，他们正以磅礴的热情和活力在中国建设社会主义。
    中华人民共和国成立十周年是亚洲和全世界历史上的一个极为重要的事件。过去十年中，中国人民在他们共产党的领导下创造了建设的奇迹，改变了你们幅员辽阔的国家的面貌。中国现在的统一超过了你们悠久的历史上的任何时代。中国已经成为争取和平和各国友好的一个强有力的因素。经济和文化的大跃进，结束了过去的落后状态，现在正在使中国沿着成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的道路前进，它的各方面的生产将在一个很短的历史时期里超过英国和其他资本主义的堡垒。
    中国人民在你们的人民共和国建立后的头十年中所获得的伟大成就，再次证明了社会主义制度的优越性。这又一次生动地证明了马克思列宁主义是普遍适用的。你们的辉煌的胜利以事实驳斥了资产阶级思想家说什么马克思列宁主义已经过时、对亚洲不适用的胡说。
    虽然亚洲的许多国家在1949年中华人民共和国成立以前就赢得了政治独立，但是它们中间没有一个国家能够取得中国在过去十年内所取得的空前的进展。它们中间甚至也没有一个国家能够梦想你们这样飞快的发展速度。这是因为你们是在沿着社会主义的道路迈进，你们的政治领导权和国家的领导权掌握在一个坚决维护马克思列宁主义的伟大的共产党所领导的劳动人民的手中。
    如果没有中国共产党和它的以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导，中国人民是不可能取得这种惊人的胜利的。生活本身已经证实你们党的总路线是正确的。
    我们党和锡兰全体人民非常珍视锡兰和中国两国人民之间的悠久巩固的友谊。周恩来同志和来锡兰访问的其他政府领导人受到的热烈欢迎以及你们国家的各个代表团受到的友好接待，就证明了这一点。锡兰人民非常重视我们两国之间的贸易协定，这种协定在我们困难的时候帮助了我们，它们是我国国民经济的力量的一个经常的源泉。我们对于中国慷慨地给予锡兰的经济援助表示感谢。
    为了破坏亚洲各国人民反对殖民主义的团结和他们维护和平的共同努力，帝国主义者和其他反动派正在千方百计地进行挑拨，企图破坏这些国家的人民同中国的传统友谊。为了掩饰他们自己对亚洲的侵略阴谋，他们诽谤中国，试图把你们国家描绘成一个“侵略者”。我们党确信，亚洲各国的人民不会上帝国主义的这种手法的当，他们将坚决地挫败施展这种手法的人。同中国的友谊对亚洲各国人民反对帝国主义、争取和平和幸福的斗争赢得胜利是必不可少的，亚洲各国人民决不会忘记这一点。
    在中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，锡兰共产党祝中国共产党和中国各族人民在将来一切顺利。我们确信，中国人民将贯彻中国共产党中央委员会第八次全体会议的决议，在今后一年内完成原定在1962年完成的第二个五年计划的主要指标。
    中华人民共和国成立十周年万岁！
    愿锡兰人民和中国人民之间的友谊和我们两党之间的兄弟团结日益巩固！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    全世界争取和平、自由和社会主义的斗争万岁！
    兄弟的各国共产党和工人党的团结万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义事业万岁！
         锡兰共产党中央委员会总书记彼得·克尼曼（附图片）
