    Wind and Thunder Everywhere
    Nanjing, Chen Zihe
    The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, like a booming spring thunder, resounded across all the land and sea of the motherland: Go all out, aim high, and strive to complete the Second Five-Year Plan this year! What an inspiring and heroic slogan of the Great Leap Forward! It's almost like a heroic and bold line of poetry, stirring the heartstrings of our hundreds of millions of people!
    In order to achieve the four major targets, the heroic and wise Chinese people are working hard and diligently. Listen, the rushing sound of Wuhan's molten steel pouring down like a waterfall, the rumbling sound of countless earthmovers on the Sanmenxia construction site, the gurgling sound of oil flowing endlessly in the Karamay mining area, the work chants of felling forests in the vast Xing'an Mountains, the whirring sound of tractors on the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps farms, the rustling sound of ten thousand acres of golden waves in the wind across the north and south of the Yangtze River, the roaring sound of fully loaded trains cutting through the long sky for thousands of miles, ah, all these sounds combine into an earth-shattering roar!
    Look! How many workers are working day and night on technological innovation, breaking through production quotas; how many experts are working day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep, creating inventions and designing new drawings; and how many farmer brothers are working diligently year-round, striving for a bumper harvest of grain and cotton; and how many commercial workers are racking their brains to find clever ways to ensure market supply… Ah, that's right, we are working and working selflessly. Yesterday, the walls here were still full of dazzling guarantees and resolutions to dedicate to the tenth anniversary of the National Day, and today, here are already a riot of colors of production successes and good news! All of this, everything, is for building socialism in a faster, better and more economical way!

    风雷遍地
    南京　陈子和
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议，像隆隆的春雷一样，响遍了祖国所有的陆地和海洋：鼓足干劲，力争上游，要在今年完成第二个五年计划！这是一个多么激动人心的大跃进的英雄口号！简直就像英雄豪迈的诗句一样，振奋着我们亿万人民的心弦！
    为了实现四大指标，英雄智慧的中国人民正在埋头苦干的劳动着。你听，那武汉钢水犹如瀑布般倾泻的哗哗声，那三门峡工地上无数掘土机的轰隆声，那克拉玛依矿区石油终年畅流的淙淙声，那茫茫的兴安岭上采伐森林的号子声，那新疆军垦农场拖拉机的哗哗声，那大江南北风吹万顷金浪的沙沙声，那满载的火车划破万里长空的吼叫声，啊，这一切所有的声音都汇合成一个惊天动地的巨响！
    你看！多少个工人夜以继日地在技术革新，突破生产定额；多少个专家废寝忘食地在创造发明，设计新的图样；又有多少个农民兄弟一年四季地在辛勤劳作，力争粮棉丰收；又有多少个商业工作者绞尽脑汁地大找窍门，保证市场供应……。啊，是这样，我们在忘我的劳动着，工作着。昨天，这里墙上还是琳琅满目的向国庆十周年献礼的保证书和决心书，今天，这里已是万紫千红的生产捷报和喜报！这一切的一切，都是为了多快好省地建设社会主义！
