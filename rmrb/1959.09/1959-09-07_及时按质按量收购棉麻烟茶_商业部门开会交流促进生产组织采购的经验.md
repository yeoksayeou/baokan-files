Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th. The Ministry of Commerce convened a procurement work conference for cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea in Zhengzhou City in late August. The meeting studied the growth of cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea in various provinces and regions this year. Based on the principle of "more procurement, faster procurement, better procurement, and sufficient procurement," the conference focused on inspecting the preparatory work for the procurement of cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea, and exchanged experiences in promoting production and organizing procurement.

The meeting believed that the growth of cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea in various provinces and regions this year is very good. Currently, tobacco leaves and autumn tea are being put on the market one after another; in some areas, the procurement of ramie first hemp has basically ended, and second hemp will soon be on the market; cotton has also begun to be procured in some areas.

This year, all localities have attached great importance to the procurement of agricultural products. With the strong support of local Party committees, commercial departments in various places have generally grasped the preparatory work early, meticulously, tightly, and well. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-one provinces and cities, 18,110 grassroots procurement outlets have been established and improved, with more than 51,300 procurement personnel assigned. In order to strengthen grading and inspection and correctly implement the state's price policy, according to incomplete statistics from fifteen provinces and cities such as Henan and Sichuan, more than 30,400 inspection technicians have been trained, and more than 630,000 farmer-technicians in grading and inspection have also been trained. Various localities have also repaired cotton processing tools early. In addition to state-owned cotton ginning factories, twelve cotton-producing provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Hebei have organized more than 49,100 private cotton ginning machines, which are being repaired and technically reformed, accounting for more than 60% of the existing private cotton ginning machines.

The meeting called on agricultural product procurement departments to launch an increase production and practice economy campaign, to do everything possible to promote increased production of cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea, to help the masses achieve careful harvesting, meticulous picking, sun drying, and thorough cleaning, and to implement the state's procurement policies, to ensure the timely, quality, and quantity fulfillment or overfulfillment of this year's cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea procurement and transfer tasks, to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day.
