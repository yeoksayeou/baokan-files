Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 11th -- The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's five large fixed open-hearth furnaces, after over fulfilling the August national plan by more than 11,300 tons of high-quality steel, completed the steel production plan for the first ten days of September eleven hours ahead of schedule, and the variety plan was also completed very well.

    According to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces comprehensively summarized the production experience of August at the beginning of this month, discussed and formulated the September production increase targets and specific measures, and carried out mass technical performance competitions and one-dragon cooperation competitions among various types of work, promoting a series of advanced experiences in furnace body maintenance, equipment maintenance, and smelting operations. Therefore, the operation rate of open-hearth furnaces was further improved, and the smelting time was shortened. The workers of the previously poorly performing No. 21 open-hearth furnace, in competition with the workers of No. 20 and No. 22 open-hearth furnaces, strengthened unity and cooperation between the four shifts and learned from the experience of advanced furnaces. From the 1st to the 9th, the time to refine a furnace of steel was shortened by an average of 22 minutes compared with the plan, and they overfulfilled the national steel production plan every day, entering the ranks of advanced open-hearth furnaces in one fell swoop. The workers of the "Open-Hearth King" No. 24 open-hearth furnace, in competition with the workers of No. 23 open-hearth furnace, strengthened furnace body maintenance, implemented the method of blowing the furnace top every shift and handling the water jacket every shift, and organized rapid steelmaking performances. Since September, the average smelting time for each furnace of steel has been shortened by one hour and fifty minutes compared with the national plan, completing the production plan for the first ten days forty-one hours ahead of schedule.

    Due to the series of measures taken by the vast number of workers, the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces produced a total of 1,990 tons more of high-quality steel than planned from the 1st to the 9th, and the daily output level increased by 19.6% compared with the same period in August.

    At present, the workers of these five large open-hearth furnaces are continuing to carry out technical performance competitions around the key to production, determined to create greater production achievements. The workers of No. 24 open-hearth furnace, which completed the first ten-day plan best, unanimously decided at the joint meeting of the four shifts on the 10th: to increase production of more than 400 tons of high-quality steel in September as a gift for the National Day.

    鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉本月上旬又打漂亮仗
    超产优质钢一千九百多吨
    新华社鞍山11日电　鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉的职工，在超额一万一千三百多吨优质钢完成8月份国家计划之后，又提前十一小时完成了9月上旬的钢产量计划，品种计划也完成得很好。
    五座大型固定式平炉的职工，根据党的八届八中全会的精神，本月初全面地总结了8月份生产经验，讨论和制订了9月份增产指标和具体措施，并且深入地开展了群众性的技术表演赛和各工种之间的一条龙协作赛，推广了炉体维护、设备检修和冶炼操作等方面一系列的先进经验。因此，进一步提高了平炉作业率，缩短了熔炼时间。原来生产较差的二十一号平炉职工，在同二十号和二十二号平炉职工开展竞赛中，由于加强四班之间的团结协作，学习先进炉的经验，1日到9日炼一炉钢的时间平均比计划缩短二十二分钟，天天超额完成国家产钢计划，一举跨进了先进平炉的行列。“平炉王”二十四号平炉的职工，在同二十三号平炉职工开展竞赛中，加强炉体维护，实行班班吹炉顶和班班处理水套的办法，组织快速炼钢表演，9月以来每炉钢的熔炼时间平均比国家计划缩短一小时五十分钟，提前四十一个小时完成了上旬的产钢计划。
    由于广大职工采取一系列的措施，五座大型固定式平炉1日到9日共比计划多产优质钢一千九百九十多吨，日产水平比8月份同期提高19.6％。
    目前，这五座大型平炉的职工正围绕着生产关键，继续开展技术表演赛，决心创造出更大的生产成就。上旬计划完成得最好的二十四号平炉职工，10日在四班联席会上一致作出决定：9月份要增产四百多吨优质钢，作为国庆节的献礼。
