Editorial: Launch a Mass Movement for Short-Distance Transportation

    The surging new high tide of the vigorous movement for increasing production and practicing economy, which is unfolding nationwide, is in full swing, and the situation on the entire economic front is very good. The volume of transportation of production and construction materials such as coal, timber, ore, and building materials has greatly increased with the arrival of the new high tide. The heavy task of purchasing, selling, and transferring agricultural and sideline products after the autumn harvest is also imminent, and the transportation of civilian coal for winter use must also be completed in the next few months. It is also necessary to store and transport the necessary materials for production and construction next spring as soon as possible. To complete such a large transportation task, in addition to relying on the existing transportation capacity of the transportation departments, short-distance transportation must be greatly strengthened. The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on launching the movement to increase production and practice economy pointed out: "All localities should use the gaps in agricultural work to actively organize rural manpower and transportation tools to launch a mass movement for short-distance transportation." The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have jointly issued instructions on launching a mass short-distance transportation movement. Therefore, organizing and mobilizing the broad masses in a planned way to quickly launch a mass movement for short-distance transportation has become an urgent task of decisive significance on the current economic front.
    Although the transportation distance of short-distance transportation is generally not long, it is an extremely important component of the entire transportation front. The exchange of industrial and agricultural products, and the transfer of various commodities and materials all need to go through one or several short-distance transportation methods to be realized. The completion of trunk line transportation tasks also depends on short-distance transportation for collecting and distributing goods. With the development of trunk line transportation, the amount of materials that need to be collected and distributed through short-distance transportation will also increase. The two upsurges in transportation and transportation construction that appeared last year in the large-scale water conservancy construction and steelmaking campaigns both started from short-distance transportation, and at the same time exposed short-distance transportation as a prominent weak link on the transportation front. Over the past year, thanks to a series of effective measures taken by the central and local governments, such as mobilizing people's communes and production teams to establish specialized transportation teams, short-distance transportation has been considerably strengthened. However, compared with the needs of the development of industrial and agricultural production in various places, the needs of urban and rural material exchanges, and the needs of trunk line transportation to collect and distribute goods, short-distance transportation is still lagging behind the development of the situation. Especially after the vigorous development of the movement to increase production and practice economy and with the arrival of the autumn harvest, the strengthening of short-distance transportation is even more urgent. It is estimated that the volume of freight transported through short-distance transportation in the fourth quarter of this year will increase by about 70% compared with the third quarter, and by about 40% compared with the same period last year. Although some modern transportation tools have been added this year, they are still not enough compared with the needs. Under such circumstances, vigorously strengthening short-distance transportation to ensure smooth flow of goods is not only an important measure to complete the national freight transportation plan, but also an important key to deepening the movement to increase production and practice economy on the entire economic front.
    How to strengthen short-distance transportation? Some comrades hope to rely on the state to increase modern transportation tools such as automobiles and ships to solve the problem of short-distance transportation. They are not very willing to engage in the mass movement of short-distance transportation, and dislike the "backwardness" of civilian transportation tools. Some people even feel that dealing with cattle and horses all day long is like being a "弼马温 [Bi Ma Wen, a minor character in the Journey to the West, whose job was to take care of the horses in heaven, often used to describe someone in a low position]". This view is obviously wrong. Automobiles, ships and other modern transportation tools have high transportation efficiency, and we have also developed and will continue to develop automobile transportation and ship transportation in the future. However, it is unrealistic to hope that automobiles and ships can completely shoulder the task of short-distance transportation. The existing automobiles and ships should first be concentrated on trunk line transportation, and short-distance transportation should still rely on the vast number of farmers to use various civilian transportation tools to solve. The mass movement has great strength, civilian transportation tools are large in number and widely distributed, and it is relatively easy to develop them. It can completely solve the problem of short-distance transportation according to local conditions and is a transportation force that cannot be ignored. Over the years, civilian transportation tools have accounted for more than 70% or even 80% of the total local transportation volume. There is no reason to ignore such a powerful transportation force.
    Engaging in transportation work during agricultural work gaps has always been an important sideline production in rural areas of our country. After the people's communes, relying on the further organized masses, there are more favorable conditions. However, the current time is the busy season for autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, and large-scale afforestation, water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and various sideline productions will also be carried out in autumn and winter. For this reason, it is necessary to properly arrange the rural labor force and take into account the needs of industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce. When mobilizing the masses to participate in transportation work, we should do more during slack farming seasons and less during busy farming seasons, and strive to complete more transportation tasks with as little labor force as possible. This is entirely possible, because: First of all, many people's communes and production teams, as well as factories, mines, ports, and stations, have already established a considerable number of specialized transportation teams and loading and unloading handling forces. This is a new backbone force for mass transportation, and their labor efficiency is much higher than that of temporarily organized transportation forces. Second, many roads have been built, many rivers have been dredged, many rails have been laid, and many cableways and chutes have been erected in last year's mass movement of short-distance transportation, and many experiences have been accumulated, providing good material conditions and technical conditions for this year's mass movement of short-distance transportation. Third, the "small, indigenous, and mass" factories and mines of last year have been rectified, consolidated, and improved, and the layout is more reasonable, and the transportation lines are relatively fixed, which is conducive to saving labor. Finally, and more importantly, short-distance transportation has attracted widespread attention, and various places have accumulated rich experience in organizing short-distance transportation. With these favorable conditions, this year's mass movement of short-distance transportation will definitely be able to complete more transportation tasks with less labor.
    The mass movement of short-distance transportation includes two aspects: one is transportation, including short-distance collection and distribution, loading and unloading and handling, and transportation at production sites such as small coal kilns, small mines, and logging yards; the other is construction, including road construction, road maintenance, and waterway dredging. All localities should actively organize transportation forces according to needs and possibilities. When organizing transportation forces, it should be clear that the main task is to do a good job in normal transportation, supplemented by necessary temporary rush transportation. Therefore, all localities must first mobilize the specialized transportation teams that have been established by people's communes and production teams, as well as factories and mines, strengthen leadership, and consolidate, improve, and develop this transportation force through this mass movement. Places that have not yet organized specialized transportation teams, or although they have organized specialized transportation teams but their strength is very weak, should organize and enrich the specialized transportation teams according to the needs and possibilities of regular transportation volume. While vigorously organizing specialized transportation teams, all localities should organize rural sideline business vehicles and ships into sideline business transportation teams, so as to seize the gaps in agricultural work at any time and participate in temporary transportation. As for the construction and maintenance of roads, it mainly relies on seizing the gaps in agricultural work to mobilize and organize the masses to carry out, and pay attention to establishing and improving regular maintenance organizations. The construction of waterways should be combined with river network development and water conservancy.
    In order to improve transportation efficiency and save labor, a high tide of technical innovation must be widely launched in this year's mass movement of short-distance transportation. In this regard, the first thing to do is to improve transportation conditions to meet the needs of thousands of troops and horses on the road. In particular, key areas and key lines should be rectified and improved as soon as possible. In places where trunk lines and branch lines connect and freight transportation is relatively concentrated, necessary turnarounds should also be built as soon as possible to prevent traffic jams. When improving transportation conditions, all localities should implement the principles of relying on the masses, using local materials, adapting to local conditions, and being economical and practical. In plains or relatively flat sections, we should vigorously promote vehicle transportation and rail transportation; in mountainous areas, hilly areas, or places where slopes can be used, we should vigorously promote cableway transportation and chute transportation; wherever there are rivers that can be used for transportation, we should actively rectify them and realize ship transportation as much as possible. We should organize and promote the improved transportation tools created by the masses last year, such as changing two-wheeled vehicles to four-wheeled vehicles, horse-drawn trains, eight-sided sailing ships, etc. Existing transportation tools should also be repaired as soon as possible, and some necessary transportation tools should be added. In technical innovation, we should also pay special attention to strengthening loading and unloading work, promoting technical innovation experiences such as skateboardization, funnelization, craneization, handling vehicleization and railization, shore slope cable carization, and high platforms and low cargo positions, and strive to load and unload at any time without accumulating goods, and accelerate the operation of vehicles and ships.
    Metallurgical, coal, forestry and other factories and mining enterprises, as well as some small industrial bases, should actively run the transportation within the enterprise that belongs to the production process, and comprehensively plan and develop various transportation methods according to the enterprise's production and terrain characteristics. Try to extract public vehicles, especially cars, to support highway trunk line transportation. In addition to fully exploiting the potential of its own transportation capacity, each material department should verify the transportation volume and organize the supply of goods for the materials that need to mobilize mass transportation, and closely cooperate with the transportation department to jointly complete the transportation task.
    To lead the mass movement of short-distance transportation, we must adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously engage in the mass movement, and strengthen administrative management and unified command on this basis. Transportation command departments at all levels should strengthen transportation command work according to the principle of "unified leadership, hierarchical management, and level-by-level contracting". First of all, we must find out the source of goods, loading and unloading capacity, and transportation capacity, formulate a unified transportation plan, set points, lines, times, tasks, leaders, and transportation capacity, and conduct planned transportation. When formulating and implementing transportation plans, we should implement the principles of "guaranteeing key points and taking care of general points" and "external before internal", and first seize the transportation of coal, ore, pig iron, timber, grain, capital construction materials, and fresh and perishable commodities that are not easy to store. The most important thing is to transport the large amount of coal accumulated within tens of kilometers of the railway line to railway stations and ports along the railway line. With a unified plan, it is also necessary to implement unified dispatch, strengthen transportation organization work, do a good job in reasonable transportation and incidental transportation, strengthen on-site command and management, and connect well with long-distance transportation, so as to fully exert transportation efficiency and avoid wasting transportation resources. At the same time, pay attention to safe production and ensure transportation quality. As for freight rates, reasonable regulations should also be made according to local conditions, and settlements should be made in a timely manner, so as to ensure the reasonable income of the masses, encourage the masses to participate in transportation, and prevent blindly raising freight rates. There should be proper arrangements for the food supply, food and accommodation, medical and health care for transportation personnel, and the supply of fodder for livestock.
    The characteristics of short-distance transportation are wide scope, large volume, many points, many policy issues, and many regional characteristics. Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over short-distance transportation work, seize the time, convey the central government's instructions on launching the mass movement of short-distance transportation to the vast number of farmers, act quickly, complete this glorious task, and guarantee the continued leap forward of industrial and agricultural production.

    开展短途运输的群众运动
    在全国范围内开展的轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动的新高潮正在方兴未艾，整个经济战线的形势非常良好。煤炭、木材、矿石和建筑材料等生产建设物资的运输量随着新高潮的到来，已经大为增长，秋收以后农副产品购销调运的繁重任务也已迫在眉睫，冬季民用煤的运输也要在今后几个月内完成，并要为明春的生产和建设及早贮运必需的物资。完成这样大的运输任务除了依靠运输部门现有的运输力量以外，必须大大加强短途运输。党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动决议中指出：“各地应该利用农事间隙，积极组织农村的人力和运输工具，开展一个短途运输的群众运动。”中共中央和国务院已联合发出关于开展群众短途运输运动的指示。因此，有计划地组织动员广大群众，迅速开展一个短途运输的群众运动，就成了当前经济战线上的一项有着决定意义的迫切任务。
    短途运输的运输距离虽然一般都不长，却是整个交通运输战线一个极为重要的组成部分。不论工农业产品的交流，各种商品物资的调出调入，都需要经过一种或几种短途运输方式才能实现。干线运输任务的完成，也有赖于短途运输为之集散货源。随着干线运输的发展，需要通过短途运输集散的物资也就越多。去年在大修水利大炼钢铁中出现的两次交通运输和交通建设高潮，都是从短途运输开始的，同时也暴露了短途运输是运输战线上突出的薄弱环节。一年来，由于中央和地方采取了一系列的有效措施，如发动人民公社和生产队建立专业运输队等等，短途运输已经有了相当的加强。但是，同各地工农业生产发展的需要，同城乡物资交流的需要，同干线运输集散货源的需要比较起来，短途运输还是落后于形势发展的。特别是在增产节约运动蓬勃开展以后和秋收到来之际，短途运输的加强更是迫不容缓。据估算，今年第四季度通过短途运输的货运量将比第三季度增长70％左右，比去年同期约增长40％。今年虽然增加了一些近代运输工具，但同需要比起来仍然不够。在这种情况下，大力加强短途运输，使货畅其流，不仅是完成全国货物运输计划的一项重要措施，而且是使整个经济战线上的增产节约运动深入开展的一个重要关键。
    怎样加强短途运输呢？有些同志希望依靠国家增加汽车、轮船等近代交通工具来解决短途运输问题，他们不大愿意搞短途运输的群众运动，嫌民间运输工具“落后”。甚至有人觉得整天和牛马打交道是做“弼马温”。这种看法显然是错误的。汽车、轮船等近代交通工具的运输效率高，我们也曾经、并且今后将继续发展汽车运输和轮船运输。但是，希望都用汽车和轮船来完全担负短途运输的任务是不现实的。现有的汽车、轮船，首先应该集中使用于干线运输，短途运输还是应该依靠广大农民使用各种民间运输工具来解决。群众运动力量大，民间运输工具数量多、分布广，发展起来也比较容易，完全能够因地制宜地解决短途运输的问题，是一支不可忽视的运输力量。民间运输工具历年来都在地方交通货运总量中担负着70％、甚至80％以上的任务。忽视这样一支强大的运输力量，是没有任何理由的。
    利用农事间隙从事运输工作，向来是我国农村一项重要的副业生产。人民公社化以后，依靠进一步组织起来了的群众，就有了更加有利的条件。但是目前正是秋收、秋种、秋耕的农忙季节，秋冬还要进行大规模的造林、兴修水利、积肥以及各种副业生产。为此，就必须妥善地安排农村劳动力，兼顾工、农、交、商各方面的需要。在动员群众参加运输工作时，应当农闲时多搞，农忙时少搞，秋后大搞，力争用尽可能少的劳动力完成更多的运输任务。这样做是完全可能的，因为：首先，现在很多人民公社和生产队以及厂、矿、港、站已经建立了相当数量的专业运输队和装卸搬运力量，这是一支新的群众运输的骨干力量，他们的劳动效率比临时组织起来的运输力量高得多。第二，去年短途运输的群众运动中已经修建了许多道路，疏浚了许多河流，铺设了许多轨道，架设了许多索道和溜槽，并且积累了许多经验，为今年开展短途运输的群众运动提供了很好的物质条件和技术条件。第三，去年的“小、土、群”厂矿经过整顿、巩固、提高，布局更加合理，运输线路相对地固定，有利于节省劳动力。最后，更重要的是，短途运输已经引起了广泛的注意，各地都已经有了组织短途运输的丰富的经验。有了这些有利的条件，今年短途运输的群众运动一定能够以较少的劳动力完成较多的运输任务。
    短途运输的群众运动包括两个方面：一是运输，包括短途集散、装卸搬运和小煤窑、小矿山、伐木场等生产现场的运输；一是建设，包括修路、养路和疏浚航道等等。各地应该根据需要和可能积极组织运输力量。在组织运输力量的时候，应该明确以搞好正常运输为主，辅以必要的临时性的突击运输。因此，各地首先要把人民公社和生产队以及厂、矿已经建立的专业运输队动员起来，加强领导，使这支运输力量通过这次群众运动得到巩固、提高和发展。还没有组织专业运输队、或者虽然组织了专业运输队但是力量很薄弱的地方，应该根据经常运输量的需要和可能，把专业运输队组织和充实起来。各地在大力组织专业运输队的同时，应该把农村副业车船组织成副业运输队，以便随时抓紧农事间隙，参加临时性的运输。至于道路的修建和养护，主要是依靠抓紧农事间隙，动员组织群众来进行，并注意建立和健全经常的养护组织。航道的建设，应该结合河网化、水利化来进行。
    为了提高运输效率，节省劳动力，在今年短途运输的群众运动中，必须广泛地掀起技术革新的高潮。在这方面，首先要抓紧改善交通条件，以适应千军万马上路的需要。特别是对于重点地区和重点线路，要及早加以整修改善。在干线和支线衔接而货物运输比较集中的地方，还应该及早建设必要的回车道，防止交通堵塞。各地在改善交通条件的时候，都应该贯彻依靠群众、就地取材、因地制宜、经济适用的原则。在平原地区或较平坦的地段，应该大搞车子化和轨道化；在山区、丘陵地带或有坡度可以利用的地方，应该大搞索道化和溜槽化；凡是有河流可通的地方，应该积极整治，尽可能的实现船运化。对于去年群众创造的改良运输工具，如改两轮车为四轮车、马拉列车、八面风帆船等等，都应该组织推广。现有的运输工具也要抓紧修理，并增加一些必要的运输工具。在技术革新中还要特别注意加强装卸工作，推广滑板化、漏斗化、起重吊车化、搬运车子化和轨道化、岸坡缆车化以及高站台、低货位等技术革新经验，争取随到随卸随装，不积压货物，加速车船运行。
    冶金、煤炭、林业等厂矿企业以及一些小型工业基地都应积极办好企业内部属于生产过程中的运输，根据企业生产和地形特点，全面规划、因地制宜地发展多种运输方式。尽可能抽出公用车辆特别是汽车支援公路干线运输。各物资部门，除充分发挥自有运力的潜力外，对于需要发动群众运输的物资，应核实运量、组织好货源，与运输部门紧密配合，共同完成运输任务。
    领导短途运输的群众运动，必须坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，并在这一基础上加强行政管理和统一指挥。各级运输指挥部门应该根据“统一领导、分级管理、层层包干”的原则，加强运输指挥工作。首先要对货源、装卸能力、运输能力进行摸底，制定统一的运输计划，定点、定线、定时间、定任务、定领导、定运力，进行有计划的运输。在编制和执行运输计划的时候，应该贯彻“保证重点照顾一般”和“先外后内”的原则，首先抓紧煤炭、矿石、生铁、木材、粮食、基建材料及不易保管的鲜活商品的运输。其中最主要的是把积存在离铁路线几十公里以内的大量煤炭搬运到铁路沿线车站和港口。有了统一的计划，还要实行统一调度，加强运输组织工作，搞好合理运输和捎脚运输，加强现场指挥管理，并要与长途运输很好衔接，以充分发挥运输效率，避免浪费运输力量。同时要注意安全生产、保证运输质量。至于运价，也应该根据各地情况作合理的规定，并且及时结算，既要保证群众的合理收入，以鼓励群众参加运输的积极性，又要防止盲目抬高运价。对于运输人员的粮食供应、饮食住宿、医药卫生以及牲畜的草料供应，都要有妥善的安排。
    短途运输的特点是面广、量大、点多、政策性的问题多、地区性的特点多。各地党委应该加强对短途运输工作的领导，抓紧时间，在广大农民中传达中央关于开展短途运输群众运动的指示，迅速行动起来，完成这一光荣的任务，保证工农业生产的继续跃进。
