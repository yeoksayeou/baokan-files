The Naval Art Exhibition features many excellent works, but the print section achieves something even more valuable. The greatest impression they give me stems from their incredibly rich sense of life. Each work reflects a particular episode of life, those episodes including rich content from all aspects of naval life, and each carefully selected by the artists. They are so full of positive meaning and emotion that they touch the hearts of the audience.

Naval prints are not made by professional artists, but why are their works so moving? There is only one answer: because they depict their own lives. The subject matter chosen by the artist is what they know best. It is easy to discover the most worthwhile episodes in the breadth of life, easy to dig out the most vibrant thoughts and feelings in the depth of life, and easy to realistically portray images through the truth of life. Here, it is once again proven that life is the only source of artistic creation, and that artists must devote themselves to the struggle of life for a long period of time to receive profound training. This is an irrefutable truth. Some experts, no matter how skilled in professional knowledge, often find their works inferior to those of the masses, and the main reason lies here.

The exhibited print works, despite some weaknesses in professional technique and artistic cultivation, generally exude a healthy and simple emotion, which is very noteworthy. Perhaps because they understand less of the current prevailing rules and regulations in art creation, their works seem more free, pure, bold and lively. I cannot completely agree if this phenomenon is understood as the authors lacking skill. To simply regard artistic technique as technology, and to simply recognize technology as elaborate carving, would suffocate the life of art. Art certainly needs corresponding technology to express itself, but the part expressed by the author's thoughts and feelings is even more important. After seeing the naval prints, I once again realized this truth.

Although naval prints are not yet mature in technique, many works are full of artistic vitality and exciting. Yang Zheng's "Resting" is a vivid portrayal of the People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan people being as close as family, dancing and having fun during a break. We have seen many works on this subject, but it is rare for a black and white woodcut to express the theme so truly and richly, simply and lively, without the help of complex plots. Chen Songchun and Xi Ling's collaborative work "Supporting Grain Transportation" is a fairly bold work in its presentation. The hull of the boat leaning against the shore almost occupies the entire screen, and the figures carrying grain are arranged in rows, reflecting the sky with bright sunset clouds, which is very prominent. This treatment of sharp contrast obviously comes from the feeling of real life. Two woodcuts on the theme of fishing each have their own advantages; Niu Minggui's "Pulling in the Net" puts the net full of fresh fish in the most conspicuous position in the foreground, and then uses the inclined diagonal line created by the fishing net to naturally lead the audience's eyes to the several fishermen working together to pull in the net on the side of the boat. The composition is clever, the theme is prominent, the knife technique is simple, the colors are harmonious, and the technique has reached a state of proficiency. The second picture is Zhang Zhengzhong's "Casting the Net", which shows several fishing boats casting their nets, dragging the fishing nets floating on the sea, and sailing forward smoothly. The sea water is depicted very vividly, and the addition of several hovering seabirds on the nearby sea surface on the fishing nets not only strengthens the mood of the seascape, but more interestingly, through these seabirds, it depicts the fish school that although cannot be seen, is actually already there, and also skillfully expresses the theme. Huang Feixun's "The Projection Team is Here" is a work very rich in life sentiment. The moon is in the sky, and the screen has been set up high on the edge of the shore. The sailors are sitting in a small boat, carrying the projection props along the small slope road to the edge of the shore. The whole picture uses extremely simple expression techniques to fully express the strong life sentiment. It is an excellent work. Zhou Hang's "Submarine Surfaces", Liao Luoping's "Our Submarine is Better Than a Dragon" and Chen Xinyi's "Light Cavalry in the Angry Sea", express the two rapidly changing objects - the submarine and the turbulent waves - so well. Without practical life experience and observation, painting skills alone cannot do it. Zhou Hang's several small black and white woodcuts such as "Parachuting" and "Mechanic" not only depict the vivid movements of the characters, but also depict the spiritual outlook of the characters, all of which are lovely works.

In addition to being excited by seeing the works of these naval officers and soldiers, I am even more moved by the fact that our People's Army is composed of the most outstanding sons and daughters of the country. In times of war, they stand on our front lines and fight bravely to defend the motherland. In times of peace, they march on all fronts. They have already established special merits on the production and transportation fronts. Now, on the cultural and artistic front, they are showing their skills. It can be said that they are both civil and military. The greater achievements of naval prints in the future are foreseeable. (Attached picture)

    生活的花朵最馨香
    ——海军美展版画作品观后记
    李桦
    海军美展中有许多好作品，但版画部分的作品有更可贵的成就。它们给我最大的感染是由于有无限浓厚的生活气息。每幅作品都反映了某一生活的情节，那些情节既包括了海军生活各方面的丰富内容，又都经过作者细致的选择，是那么富有积极意义，那么充满感情，因而都能打动观众的心。
    海军的版画都不是专业作者作的，但是他们的作品这样动人，原因何在？答案只有一个，就是：由于他们所描绘的是自己的生活。作者所选择的创作题材是他所最熟悉的，便易于在生活的广度中发现最值得表现的每个情节，也易于在生活的深度中挖掘最富有活力的思想感情，同时也易于透过生活的真实来进行合情合理的形象刻划。这里又一次证明了：生活是文艺创作唯一源泉，艺术家必须长期地投身到生活的斗争中去接受深刻的锻炼，这是一个颠扑不破的真理。有些专家们的专业知识不论怎样高明，他们的作品比起群众的来，往往显得逊色的主要原因，也就在这里。
    展出的版画作品，在专业技巧和艺术修养方面，尽管还存在着弱点，但是在它们中间普遍地流露着一种健康的、质朴的感情，是非常值得注意的。也许由于他们还少懂得些当前流行于美术创作中的清规戒律，所以在他们的作品中似乎更感自由，纯真，胆大而活泼。如果把这一现象理解为作者们尚缺乏技巧，我是不能完全同意的。把艺术的技巧简单地看作技术，又把技术简单地认作是精工的雕琢，那就会把艺术的生命窒息了。艺术固然需要相应的技术来表达，但是借作者的思想感情来表达的部分就更为重要，看过海军版画后，使我再一次认识这个真理。
    海军版画尽管在技术上还不够成熟，却有许多作品是充沛着艺术生命力而且激动人心的。羊争的“小憩”是描写解放军和西藏人民亲如家人，在休息时舞蹈取乐的生动的写照。这样题材的作品我们看过不少了，难得像这幅黑白木刻把主题毫不借助于复杂的情节，而表现得那么真切而又丰富，朴素而又活泼的。陈松春、西玲合作的“支援运粮”在表现上是相当豪迈的作品。靠在岸边的船身几乎占着整个画面，运粮的人影成行地掩映在衬着亮色的晚霞的天空中，显得非常突出。这种鲜明对比的处理手法，显然是来自现实生活的感受。以捕鱼为题材的二幅木刻，各有优点；牛茗桂的“起网”把捕满鲜鱼的网，放在前景最显目的位置，然后利用鱼网所造成的倾斜对角线，把观众的眼睛很自然地引到在船舷协力拉网的几个渔民。构图巧妙，主题突出，刀法单纯，色彩和谐，技巧已达到了熟练之境了。第二幅是张征众的“撒网”，表现撒下了网的几艘渔船，拖着浮在海面的鱼网，正扬帆顺风前进。海水刻划得非常生动，而在近处的海面加上在鱼网上几只徘徊低飞的水鸟，由此不仅加强了海景的情调，更有意思的是，通过这些水鸟，刻划出虽然还看不见，而实在已经存在的鱼群，同时也就巧妙地表现了主题。黄飞迅的“放映队来了”是一幅非常富于生活情调的作品。月在当空，银幕已经高高地张开在涯岸上了，水兵们坐着小艇将放映的道具沿小坡路送上涯岸，全画用极其单纯的表现手法，将浓厚的生活情调充分地表现出来，是幅优秀的作品。周行的“潜艇浮起”，廖罗平的“我们的潜艇胜蛟龙”和陈辛一的“怒海轻骑”，把两种迅速变化的对象——潜艇和激动的波涛表现得那么好，不是有了实际的生活经验和观察，单凭画技是无能为力的。周行的几幅小黑白木刻如“跳伞”与“机械员”，不仅刻划出了人物鲜明的动作，而且刻划出人物的精神面貌，都是可爱的作品。
    我除了由于看到这些海军官兵们的作品而兴奋外，受到更大感动的是：我们的人民部队是由全国最优秀的儿女们组成的。当战争时，他们站在我们的最前线，为捍卫祖国而奋不顾身。当和平时，他们向各条战线上进军。在生产战线和运输战线上，他们已经建立殊勋了，现在，在文化艺术战线上，他们又大显身手，真可以说是文武全才。海军版画未来的更大的成就是可以预期的。（附图片）
