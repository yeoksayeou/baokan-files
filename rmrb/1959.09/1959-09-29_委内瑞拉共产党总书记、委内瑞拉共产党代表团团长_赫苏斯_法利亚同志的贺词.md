Comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, dear Chinese people, industrious friends:

Our party and the people of our country, with great excitement and sympathy, congratulate the Chinese people on the great victories achieved in all fields under the correct leadership of the working class.

The people of our country, like all people suffering from imperialist oppression, have been paying close attention to the victorious progress made by the Chinese people on the socialist road.

Having overcome the enemy's mad resistance, and with the enthusiastic support and protection of the working people and progressive strata of all countries in the world, the Chinese revolution stands vibrantly and energetically before the whole world.

Those of us who have come to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the People's Republic of China also fulfill our internationalist duty, and we enjoy the incomparable happiness of strengthening our friendship with the leaders of this great country, with the invincible Chinese people.

As revolutionaries dedicated to the cause of our people, we are happy to be able to share with the people of the world the joy of the irresistible advance of Marxist-Leninist thought, which, with the enthusiastic support of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, has become a solid reality in this great country.

China and the Chinese people have also received this support from the working class and people of all countries in the world, even though its expression is different, because here, the just cause of liberating the masses from ignorance, poverty, and oppression has triumphed.

Our Party thanks the fraternal invitation of the Communist Party of China, which, together with the Communists of the whole world, joyfully participates in this glorious celebration.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world! (Attached picture)
