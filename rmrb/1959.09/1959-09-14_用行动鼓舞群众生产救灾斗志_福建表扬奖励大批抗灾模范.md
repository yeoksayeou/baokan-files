Xinhua News Agency report: Party and government leading organs and people's communes in the coastal areas of Fujian Province recently summarized the experience of fighting against typhoons, rainstorms, and storm surges, and commended and rewarded a large number of model figures and advanced units in disaster relief. In the four counties of Fuan, Fuding, Xiapu, and Ningde alone, more than 7,200 model figures in disaster relief have been commended and rewarded respectively, including 1,342 Communist Party members and 1,316 Communist Youth League members.

More than 70 cadres and commune members of the Yantian Commune in Xiapu County who were commended fought for two days and two nights in the storm to protect the Guanling Bridge. When trees blown down and broken by the strong wind flowed down the river and blocked the bridge piers, endangering the bridge, 28 people, including Communist Party members Huang Fuque, Chen Yonglan, and Cai Shuwang, bravely jumped into the rapids, dug out the wood and weeds, and sawed off large tree trunks, protecting the bridge from danger. Zhu Naijin, a member of the Communist Youth League in the Diantou Commune of Fuding County, disregarding the fact that his house had been blown down by the strong wind, stuck to the seawall for three consecutive nights in order to protect the safety of the seawall, until the typhoon and storm surge subsided, protecting the seawall. Lin Mingtuan, a People's Policeman in Siming District, Xiamen City, helped a large number of residents evacuate to safe areas during the typhoon that struck Xiamen on August 23, and rescued seven residents from under collapsed houses. Chen Genzhi, deputy director of the Tongwen Neighborhood Committee in Siming District, Xiamen City, waded into the water to rescue people while sick when the typhoon struck. When she heard a cry for help coming from Chen Fen's house on Lujiang Road, she immediately rushed in and rescued two children just before the house collapsed.

The model figures and advanced units that have been commended have profoundly educated the masses and inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses for production and disaster relief. Model figures and the masses in Fuan, Fuding, Xiapu, Xiamen and other places responded to the great call of the Party Central Committee and more actively devoted themselves to the great upsurge of the overproduction movement.
