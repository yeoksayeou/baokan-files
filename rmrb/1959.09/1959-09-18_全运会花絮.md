All-China Games Anecdotes

Old-timers and Newcomers

The first day of the Chinese-style wrestling competition saw veteran Shandong wrestler Tan Shusen against Jiangxi newcomer Li Shengcai in the middleweight division. As soon as they engaged, Tan took the initiative, displaying a series of techniques such as pulling, hooking, and inside leg sweeps. In the nine-minute contest of three rounds, he threw Li Shengcai eighteen times, averaging a fall every half minute. The audience marveled at the spectacle. Little did they know that this "record" would be broken in less than twenty-four hours. The next day, in the lightweight division, People's Liberation Army athlete He Runzong defeated Hunan's Hu Yiliang. After nine minutes of fierce fighting, He Runzong threw his opponent nineteen times, averaging a fall in less than half a minute. Soon after, even more exciting scenes unfolded. In the lightweight division, Hebei's strongman Jia Fucai against Jiangxi's Tan Jingmin, and Shanxi steelworker Bo Haisheng against Qinghai's Ga Lima, all used their hands, elbows, arms, shoulders, and legs in the first three-minute round, employing tripping, entanglement, lifting, grabbing, and stroking techniques, averaging a fall every twenty-two seconds. It was truly intense and thrilling! No wonder the audience on the stands repeatedly praised, saying: Our wrestlers now have not only good physical strength and vigor, but also many techniques, and their skills are becoming increasingly comprehensive.

Outside the Wrestling Arena

As soon as the opening gong of the wrestling competition sounded, a torrential downpour began, and the competition was temporarily suspended. However, the audience was still reluctant to leave. Thus, the athletes' locker room became a rest area and commentary forum for the audience. Outside the window, heavy rain poured down, while inside, there was laughter and lively discussion.

People talked about the opening act – last year's flyweight runner-up, Beijing's strongman Qian Deren, losing to Liaoning's newcomer Zhang Guosheng, and about how wrestlers should avoid being too eager to win. They talked about how this era is an era of emerging newcomers and formidable juniors. People regretted that Shen Yousan, who possessed unique skills and dominated the wrestling scene thirty or forty years ago, had his good skills ruined by opium and heroin in the old society... Old spectators with graying hair and middle school students with childish looks, despite having never met and having vastly different experiences, shared a common language due to their common love for wrestling. Thus, they talked at length, happily forgetting to return home for dinner. This shows the widespread foundation and enthusiastic welcome that wrestling enjoys among the people of Beijing.

Chess Fan's Insight

Early in the morning, the tea house in the Laboring People's Cultural Palace, with its ancient cypresses, was full of people. People were not leisurely sipping tea and chatting, but were attentively listening to lectures and taking notes.

What important report was this? ... The loudspeaker broadcasted the sound of "Red cannon two moves to five, black horse eight advances to seven." Oh! It was chess fans in Beijing appreciating a wonderful game from the All-China Games Chinese chess competition – Gansu's Wu Yanfu drawing against last year's national champion, Hubei's Li Yiting. When Li Yiting only had two cannons and a single pawn left, while Wu Yanfu still had a knight, a cannon, and two pawns, and was aggressively pressing forward with an obvious advantage, everyone was sweating for Li Yiting. A young man resembling a worker in the audience was actually calm and composed, giving his opinions and ideas for Li Yiting's moves. Moreover, what he said and what Li Yiting later played had many coincidences. It was truly a case of "great minds think alike." Perhaps in a few years, this man will also be a good hand on the chess scene.

Overseas Chinese Hearts

Athlete Fu Dajin, a returned overseas Chinese student, walked excitedly with a small leather bag to the swimming pool of the Beijing Gymnasium, took off his leather shoes, changed clothes, and seized the time for pre-competition practice. The day before, he had won first place in the 400-meter freestyle final and was aiming to win another championship in the 200-meter freestyle competition.

Suddenly, someone brought him a letter. He saw the words "Wishing the letter to fly like a bird, the faster the better" written on the envelope, how could he not read it immediately? He opened the letter and exclaimed, "Ah! It's another overseas Chinese." He said to a comrade beside him, "Overseas Chinese are extremely happy to see the continuous improvement of the country's sports level and the repeated breaking of world records. Many overseas Chinese have specially returned to the country to watch this Games." He casually pulled out a letter from his pocket, a letter from an overseas Chinese named Zhao Shanzhong who had rushed back from Australia to watch the Games. This overseas Chinese, Zhao Shanzhong, wrote a poem in the letter: "Fu Jun arrives in Beijing today, everyone watches you launch a satellite, world records are all attacked, red flying fish seize the lead."

Youngster's Ambition

The famous athlete Qiu Zhonghui lost a game to a young girl from the Zhejiang team, Yu Cijun, in a table tennis team competition on the 16th.

Little Yu is only sixteen years old this year and came to Beijing for the first time to participate in such a large-scale Games. After arriving in Beijing, she didn't have time to play and practiced with her companions from morning till night. One day, she saw Qiu Zhonghui and Wang Jian practicing, the ball flying back and forth, and was very envious of Xiao Qiu's excellent hitting skills. "How great it would be to practice with her!" She indeed got Qiu Zhonghui's consent, and several people started playing doubles. Afterwards, Xiao Yu told others: "I learned a lot from this practice." She wanted to defeat Xiao Qiu and others someday.

On the 16th, in the Zhejiang vs. Beijing team competition, when it was Xiao Yu's turn to play, she encountered Qiu Zhonghui. After being defeated by Xiao Qiu in the first game, she did not lose heart. She went all out in the second game and managed to defeat Xiao Qiu, feeling unspeakably happy. However, she lost the third game, resulting in a two-to-one loss to Qiu Zhonghui. Xiao Yu was still not discouraged and said: "We will defeat stronger opponents in the future."

    全运会花絮
    老将新手
    中国式摔跤鸣锣开场的第一天，中量级山东老将谭树森对江西新手李生才。双方一交手，老谭先声夺人，连续施展扒拿、挑勾和里勾腿等绝招，在三个回合的九分钟竞赛中，把李生才摔倒了十八次。平均半分钟胜一跤。观众为之大叹观止。岂知这个“纪录”保持不到二十四小时就被打破。第二天轻量级的解放军选手何润宗力胜湖南胡意良。九分钟激战，何润宗竟把对手一连摔倒十九次。平均不到半分钟就胜一跤。紧接着更精彩的场面就纷纷呈现，轻量级的河北健将贾福才对江西谭敬敏、山西炼钢工人薄海生对青海尕立麻，都是在第一个回合的三分钟中，手、肘、臂、肩、腿并用，绊、缠、挑、抓、捋兼施，平均二十二秒多胜一次跤。真是紧张，惊险之至！难怪观众台上啧啧称赞之声四起。大家都说：咱们的摔跤手现在不但体力好，劲头足，而且方法多，技术日臻全面。
    摔跤场外
    摔跤的开场锣刚刚打过，就是一场倾盆大雨，竞赛暂时停止举行。但是观众仍然依依恋恋不肯散去。于是，运动员的更衣室就变成观众的休息室和评论坛，窗外豪雨如注，室内谈笑风生。
    人们从开台戏——去年的最轻级亚军、北京的健将钱德仁输给辽宁新手张国生，谈到摔跤切忌求胜心切；谈到我们这个时代是新手辈出和后生可畏的时代；人们惋惜身怀绝技的三、四十年前独霸摔跤坛的沈友三，惋惜他的一副好身手毁在旧社会的鸦片和海洛英的烟雾里。……须发斑白的老观众和稚态可掬的中学生，尽管素昧生平，经历悬殊，但是对于摔跤的共同爱好，使他们之间有着共同的语言。于是娓娓而谈，乐而忘返。其实早就该是回家吃饭的时候了。摔跤运动在北京人民中有着广泛的基础和受到热烈的欢迎，于此可见一斑。
    棋迷高见
    清晨，劳动人民文化宫古柏苍天的茶座里，坐满了人。人们不是在悠闲地品茗、聊天，而是在聚精会神地听讲和记笔记。
    是什么重要的报告？……扩音器传来了“红炮二平五，黑马八进七”的响声。哦！是北京的棋迷在欣赏全运会中国象棋比赛精彩的一场——甘肃武延福逼和去年全国冠军湖北李义庭。当李义庭只剩下双炮单卒而武延福尚有马炮双兵，以显然的优势咄咄进逼的时候，大家都在为李义庭捏一把汗。场下的一个工人模样的年轻人，居然胸有成竹，临危不乱，满腹经论地在自言自语，替李义庭出主意。而且他说的和后来李义庭走的，颇多巧合。真是“英雄所见略同”，说不定若干年后，此君也是棋坛上一条好汉。
    华侨的心
    运动健将、归国华侨学生符大进，提了一个小皮包兴冲冲地走到了北京体育馆游泳馆，脱皮鞋，更衣，抓紧赛前练习。他在前一天才获得了四百米自由泳决赛第一名，还要争取在二百米自由泳比赛中再夺冠军。
    突然，有一个人给他送来一封信。他一看信封上写着：“愿信如鸟飞，越快越好”，怎么能不马上看看？他拆开信一看：“啊！原来又是华侨。”对身边的一位同志说：“华侨看到祖国的体育运动水平不断提高，一次又一次打破世界纪录，实在太高兴了。许多华侨都特地赶回国来看这次运动会。”他顺手便从裤袋里抽出了一封刚从澳大利亚赶回国来看运动会的华侨给他的信。这位华侨名叫赵善钟，在信上提了一首诗：“符君今朝到北京，大家看你放卫星，世界纪录齐冲击，红色飞鱼夺先声。”
    小将雄心
    著名的运动健将丘钟惠，16日在乒乓球团体赛的一盘比赛中，曾经输给浙江队的一位小姑娘余慈君一局。
    小余今年才十六岁，第一次到北京来参加规模这么大的运动会，来北京后没顾得上玩，就和她的同伴从早到晚练个不停。一天，她见到丘钟惠和王健正在练球，球儿来去如飞，非常羡慕小丘她们这么好的击球技术。“要是同她在一起练练球多好啊！”她果然得到丘钟惠的同意，几个人打起双打来了。事后小余告诉别人：“这次练球学到不少东西”。她想总有一天把小丘她们打败。
    16日团体赛浙江对北京，轮到小余上场就碰上丘钟惠，第一局被小丘打败后，没有灰心，第二局一鼓作气拚命争夺，把小丘打败，心里真有说不出的高兴，但是第三局她又败了，结果是二比一，仍然输给丘钟惠。小余还是不泄气，仍然说：“以后我们还要打败强的对手。”
