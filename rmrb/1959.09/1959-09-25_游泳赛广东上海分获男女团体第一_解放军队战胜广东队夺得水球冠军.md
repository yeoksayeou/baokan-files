The Guangdong team won the second place. The following are the rankings: Fujian, Guangxi, Shanghai, Sichuan, Liaoning, Hubei. The PLA and Guangdong teams were the strongest teams among the nine units participating in this water polo competition. Today's match between these two strong teams attracted great interest from the audience. The PLA water polo team, with its tenacious fighting style, took the lead after the opening, scoring a goal with lightning speed. The Guangdong team quickly caught up, but the PLA players closely marked the Guangdong players and tightly blocked the goal, causing the Guangdong team's five shots to be unsuccessful. When the PLA team attacked the Guangdong team's position, the Guangdong team also tightly blocked the goal, forcing the PLA team to delay their attack. Being judged as "unintentional attack" gave the Guangdong team a chance to serve, and they finally scored a goal, ending the first half with a score of 1-1. In the second half, the PLA launched a fierce offensive, scoring continuously. Just as the Guangdong team was about to launch a major counter-offensive, time ran out, ending the game with a score of 5-2.
