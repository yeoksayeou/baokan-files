Xinhua News Agency, 25th: Over the past decade, the nation's preferential treatment and demobilization placement work has achieved tremendous success, playing a significant role in the great cause of building and defending the motherland.

During various revolutionary war periods, hundreds of thousands of revolutionary martyrs contributed their precious lives to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. After the founding of the People's Republic, the Party and the government posthumously recognized those who had sacrificed before liberation but had not been granted the title of martyr. Over the past decade, more than 629,000 revolutionary martyrs have been posthumously recognized, and more than 192,339,200 yuan in pensions have been issued to their families. In the past decade, more than 5,200 memorial buildings such as martyr cemeteries and martyr memorial parks have been built across the country to commend the heroic achievements of revolutionary martyrs. The Party and the government show great concern for the children of revolutionary martyrs. In addition to being able to enjoy general scholarships as a priority, the children of martyrs studying in schools can also enjoy a separate enrollment subsidy for children of martyrs. In the past decade, approximately 2 million person-times of children of martyrs have received this enrollment subsidy. The posthumous recognition and commendation of martyrs, as well as the pensions for their families, have further stimulated the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people and conducted a vivid education in revolutionary traditions for China's younger generation.

The Party, the government, and the people show great concern and provide earnest care for the production and lives of families of martyrs and military dependents. At present, the production and lives of families of martyrs and military dependents across the country have been properly arranged. People's communes in rural areas and grassroots governments in cities have assigned appropriate jobs to all families of martyrs and military dependents who are able to work, so that they can increase their income as much as possible. Some families of martyrs and military dependents have weak labor forces, and although they participate in production, their income is less than that of ordinary people. The people's communes provide additional labor day subsidies or preferential treatment allowances to this part of the families of martyrs and military dependents, so that the lives of military dependents are not lower than the level of ordinary people, and the living standards of families of martyrs are slightly higher than those of ordinary people. Mass activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of military personnel are an important aspect of ensuring the daily lives of families of martyrs and military dependents. Before the people's commune movement, the people across the country also treated families of martyrs and military dependents in various ways. After enjoying mass preferential treatment, families of martyrs and military dependents who still have special difficulties in life or who encounter temporary difficulties are also provided with living allowances by the local government. Over the past decade, the state has issued more than 420 million yuan in living allowances to families of martyrs and military dependents. Approximately 750,000 families of martyrs receive regular and quantitative subsidies from the government every year, and an average of more than 4.2 million families of martyrs and military dependents receive temporary subsidies every year. For elderly or disabled families of martyrs and military dependents who have no one to take care of them, local people have also specially organized preferential treatment groups to help them with housework. Nursing homes in people's communes across the country give priority to admitting elderly and frail families of martyrs and military dependents who have no one to take care of them, and provide them with better living conditions. In areas with a large number of families of martyrs, special nursing homes for families of martyrs or glorious nursing homes have also been established. According to incomplete statistics from eight provinces, cities, and autonomous regions such as Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia, there are 441 nursing homes for families of martyrs.

The Party and the government are very concerned about revolutionary disabled soldiers. The state provides long-term or one-time pensions according to the degree of loss of their ability to work. Over the past decade, the state has issued a total of more than 254,120,000 yuan in disability pensions. Most provinces and autonomous regions across the country have established sanatoriums and convalescent homes for disabled soldiers to specially care for and treat revolutionary disabled soldiers with more severe disabilities. In order to improve the cultural and knowledge level of disabled soldiers and create employment opportunities for them, the state has specially established schools for disabled soldiers. From 1949 to 1956, over a period of seven years, more than 260,000 disabled soldiers were admitted to schools to study. After graduation, more than 60,000 people participated in work in institutions, factories, mines, and enterprises, and more than 4,000 people were admitted to universities for further study. The state has also established 26 prosthetic factories to specially equip disabled soldiers with prostheses and auxiliary equipment. Over the past decade, a total of 150,000 prostheses and orthopedic devices have been produced, and prostheses, orthopedic devices, or auxiliary equipment have been installed for more than 80,000 disabled soldiers.

From 1950 to the present, hundreds of thousands of demobilized soldiers have been discharged and returned to their hometowns every year, which is a positive force in the cause of national construction. After their demobilization, the Party and the government, according to the needs of construction and the different conditions of the demobilized soldiers, promptly and properly placed them on various production fronts and work posts, and provided them with all possible conveniences to enable them to continue to play an active role in production and construction. Over the past decade, approximately 5 million demobilized soldiers have been placed on the agricultural production front, and they have now become the backbone force in developing agricultural production and improving rural work. The state has placed demobilized officers above the rank of platoon leader and some demobilized soldiers with a certain level of education and special skills in state organs, industrial and mining enterprises, and basic construction units for work, which to a certain extent has supported the state's need for personnel in the construction industry. Over the past decade, hundreds of thousands of demobilized soldiers in our country have also been transferred to border areas, coastal defense areas, agricultural reclamation areas, and large-scale basic construction units in an organized manner to engage in production and construction. These collectively transferred demobilized soldiers have made many meritorious contributions to the cause of national construction.

From 1950 to the present, more than 7 million demobilized soldiers have been received and placed across the country. Such a concentrated and large-scale handling of military demobilization, and such a rapid and orderly placement of them in various production and construction posts, is not only difficult for all capitalist countries to accomplish, but it is also a remarkable miracle in the history of our country.

Families of martyrs, military dependents, honored servicemen, and demobilized soldiers across the country are wholeheartedly loyal to the revolutionary cause and have always stood at the forefront of the struggle during the socialist revolution and socialist construction. They are now actively responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and together with the broad masses, are striving courageously and with full confidence to complete and overfulfill this year's production plan.

    烈属、军属、荣誉军人、复员军人为祖国建设立下功勋
    优抚和复员安置工作遍地开花
    据新华社25日讯　全国的优抚和复员安置工作，十年来取得了巨大的成就，在建设和保卫祖国的伟大事业中起了显著的作用。
    在各个革命战争时期，有成千上万的革命先烈，为了中国人民的解放事业贡献出自己的宝贵生命。建国以后，党和政府对于解放前牺牲而没有给予烈士称号的烈士，都进行了追认。十年来，经过追认的革命烈士共有六十二万九千多人，发放给他们家属的抚恤金共一亿九千二百三十三万九千多元。十年来，各地兴修了烈士陵园和烈士公墓等纪念性的建筑五千二百多座，以褒扬革命先烈的丰功伟绩。党和政府对于革命烈士的子女，关怀倍至，在学校学习的烈士子女，除了可以优先享受一般的助学金以外，还可以享受单独的烈士子女入学补助金。十年中，受到过这项入学补助费补助的烈士子女，约达二百万人次。对烈士的追认和褒扬，以及对他们家属的抚恤，进一步激发了人民群众的革命热情，向我国青年一代进行了生动的革命传统的教育。
    党和政府以及人民群众，对于烈属、军属的生产、生活，给予高度的关怀和殷切的照顾。目前，全国烈属、军属的生产和生活都得到了妥善的安排。各地农村的人民公社和城市的基层政权，对于凡是能工作的烈属、军属都分配了适当的工作，使他们能尽可能地增加收入。有些烈属、军属劳动力很弱，虽然参加生产，但收入要比一般群众少。人民公社对于这一部分烈属、军属就另外给予补助劳动日或发放优待金，使军属的生活不低于一般群众的水平，烈属的生活水平稍高于一般群众。群众性的拥军优属活动，是保障烈属、军属日常生活的一个重要方面。在人民公社化运动以前，全国人民也以多种方式优待烈属、军属。在享受群众优待以后，生活上仍有特殊困难的或临时发生困难的烈属、军属，当地政府还发给生活补助费。十年来国家发给烈属、军属生活补助费达四亿二千多万元。每年享受政府定期定量补助的烈属约有七十五万人，享受临时补助的烈属、军属每年平均达四百二十多万人。对于家中无人照顾的年老或病残的烈属、军属，各地群众还专门组织了优抚小组，帮助他们料理家务。各地人民公社的敬老院都优先吸收家中无人照顾的年老体弱的烈属、军属，并且为他们准备较好的生活条件。在烈属较多的地区，还专门举办了烈属养老院或光荣敬老院。仅据河北、山西、内蒙古等八个省、市、自治区的不完全统计，就设有烈属养老院四百四十一所。
    党和政府十分关心革命残废军人。国家根据他们丧失劳动能力的程度，分别给予长期或者一次抚恤。十年来，国家共发出残废抚恤金二亿五千四百一十二万多元。全国大部分省、自治区都设立了残废军人休养院和疗养院，专门抚养和治疗残废较重的革命残废军人。为了提高残废军人的文化知识水平和给他们创造就业条件，国家专门举办了残废军人学校。从1949年到1956年的七年期间，先后接收二十六万多名残废军人入校学习，毕业后，参加机关、厂矿、企业等单位工作的有六万多人，考入高等学校继续学习的有四千多人。国家还设立了二十六所假肢工厂，专门给残废军人装配假肢和辅助器械。十年来，共生产假肢、矫形器械十五万件，给八万多名残废军人安装了假肢、矫形或辅助器械。
    从1950年到现在，全国每年都有十几万复员军人退役回乡，这是祖国建设事业中的一支积极力量。在他们复员之后，党和政府根据建设需要和复员军人的不同条件，把他们及时地、妥善地安置到各个生产战线上和工作岗位上，并且给他们提供一切可能提供的便利条件，使他们在生产建设中继续发挥积极作用。十年来大约有五百余万复员军人被安置在农业生产战线上，他们现在已经成为发展农业生产和改进农村工作的骨干力量。国家把退出现役的排级以上复员军官和一部分具有一定文化水平和专门技术的复员军人，安置到国家机关、工矿企业、基本建设等单位中工作，这在一定程度上支援了国家建设事业用人的需要。十年来，我国还有数十万复员军人，成建制地集体转业到边疆地区、海防地区、农垦地区和大型基本建设单位从事生产建设。这些集体转业的复员军人，在祖国的建设事业中建立了不少功勋。
    从1950年到现在，全国各地共接收安置了七百多万复员军人，这样集中地、大批地处理军队复员，又这样迅速地、有秩序地把他们安置到各个生产建设岗位上，这不仅是一切资本主义国家所难办到的，在我国的历史上也是一宗了不起的奇迹。
    全国烈属、军属、荣誉军人和复员军人，对于革命事业赤胆忠心，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，始终站在斗争的最前列。他们现在积极响应党的八届八中全会的号召，同广大群众一起，奋发勇为，信心百倍，为完成和超额完成今年的生产计划而努力奋斗。
