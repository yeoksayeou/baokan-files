    棒球垒球北京队双获冠军
    据新华社26日讯　全国运动会棒球和女子垒球决赛经过五十六场比赛，25日全部结束。北京棒球队和北京女子垒球队双获冠军。解放军队和陕西队分获棒球和女子垒球亚军；上海得男子棒球和女子垒球第三名；湖北得男子棒球和女子垒球第四名。
    在棒、垒球决赛整个过程中，各队都发挥了充分干劲，竞赛十分激烈。棒球和女子垒球冠军都是经过层层苦战才获得最后胜利的。北京棒球队的战绩是六胜一负，北京女子垒球队则是六胜一平取得首位。上海棒球队在前三年全国比赛中曾连获优胜，但在这次决赛中却相继败给比较年轻的北京队和解放军队，并在最后一轮比赛中以四比四被第一次参加全国性棒球比赛的湖北队打成平局。
