Xinhua News Agency, September 5th. Beijing’s basic construction departments achieved brilliant results in the first campaign of the final stage completion blitz, which ran from August 12th to 31st. The completed area reached over 763,000 square meters. The projects included nineteen workshops in eight factories, such as the Beijing Special Steel Plant, the Beijing Chemical Experiment Plant, and the Beijing Plastics Factory; a number of important public buildings such as the Workers' Stadium and the Overseas Chinese Mansion; and a large number of residences and school buildings.

At the beginning of the campaign, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all construction workers in the city to work hard for fifty days to complete one million square meters of finishing projects to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers in the city responded enthusiastically to the Party's call and launched a large-scale blitz to complete and eliminate unfinished projects with vigorous fighting spirit and selfless labor enthusiasm. Each construction company and its subordinate construction sites formulated detailed battle plans, teams and groups formulated guarantee conditions, and construction sites, teams and groups launched competitions. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the call to increase production and practice economy, the workers were even more motivated, and a new construction upsurge immediately appeared on the construction sites. The weather in mid- and late August was particularly hot, and coupled with multiple rainstorms, it brought great difficulties to the construction. However, the heroic construction workers put forward the slogan of "work hard in light rain, work harder in light rain, and work especially hard when there is no rain," and many workers did not leave the front line even in heavy rain. Many construction sites completed the first battle's targets ahead of schedule and exceeded them. The Plastics Factory construction site of the Beijing Second Construction Company originally planned to complete 36 projects by the end of August, but after the workers' hard work, they actually completed 45 projects. The 601 construction site of the Beijing Sixth Construction Company originally planned to build six buildings by the end of the first campaign, but completed the plan by August 25.

Resolutely implementing the Municipal Party Committee's proposed policy of concentrating manpower and material resources, conducting blitzes in batches and by project, eliminating one project and then another, was an important reason for ensuring the great victory of the first campaign. Originally, some construction sites were progressing slowly due to the dispersion of construction forces. After the campaign began, each construction company and construction site redeployed and adjusted their forces, which rapidly increased the completed area. Some projects of the Beijing Second Construction Company that were originally planned to be completed in September or October were completed ahead of schedule in August. More than 9,800 square meters of projects at the 305 construction site of the Beijing Sixth Construction Company, which were originally scheduled to be completed and put into use successively after October, were also completed in August.

September 1st to 15th is the second campaign of the final completion blitz. Construction workers in each unit are advancing victoriously with even more vigorous spirits.

    建筑工人展开收尾工程突击战
    首都大批工程提前竣工
    第一战役竣工面积七十六万多平方米
    新华社5日讯　北京市基本建设部门从8月12日到31日开展的收尾竣工突击第一战役，取得了辉煌战果。竣工面积达七十六万三千多平方米，工程包括北京特殊钢厂、北京化工实验厂、北京塑料厂等八个工厂的十九个车间，工人体育场、华侨大厦等一批重要的公共建筑，还有大批的住宅和校舍等。
    中共北京市委在战役开始时号召全市建筑职工大干五十天，拿下一百万平方米收尾工程，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。全市十几万建筑职工热烈响应党的号召，以旺盛的斗志和忘我的劳动热情，展开了声势浩大的突击收尾歼灭战。各建筑公司和所属工地制定了详细的作战计划，队、组制定了保证条件，工地与工地、队与队、组与组纷纷展开竞赛。党的八届八中全会提出增产节约的战斗号召以后，职工们更是干劲冲天，工地上立即出现了新的建设高潮。8月中、下旬天气特别炎热，加上多次暴雨，给施工带来很大困难。但是英勇的建筑工人们提出了“大雨小干，小雨大干，无雨特干”的口号，许多工人在倾盆大雨时也不下火线。很多工地都提前和超额完成了第一战役的指标。北京市第二建筑公司塑料厂工地，原来预定8月底完成三十六个工程项目，经过职工奋战，实际完成了四十五项。北京市第六建筑公司六○一工地，原定计划第一战役结束时建成六幢楼，到8月25日就完成了计划。
    坚决执行市委所提出的集中人力物力，分期分批分项目进行突击，歼灭一个再歼灭一个的方针，是保证第一战役取得大胜的重要原因。原来有些工地因施工力量分散，工程进展缓慢。运动开始以后，各建筑公司和工地都重新部署和调整了力量，使竣工面积迅速增加。北京市第二建筑公司原计划在9月份或10月份竣工的一部分工程，提前在8月份就完成了。北京市第六建筑公司三○五工地，按照原计划要到10月以后才能陆续竣工交付使用的工程，也有九千八百多平方米在8月份竣工。
    9月1日到15日，是收尾竣工突击的第二战役。各单位建筑职工正以更加奋发的精神乘胜前进。
