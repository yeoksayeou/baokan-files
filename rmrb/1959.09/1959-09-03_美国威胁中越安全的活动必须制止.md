Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd. Vice Premier Chen Yi said today: "As a participating country of the Geneva Conference and a close neighbor of Laos, China firmly maintains that: The U.S. activities threatening the security of China and Vietnam and endangering the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia must be stopped, the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements must be observed, and the independence, unity, and peaceful neutrality of Laos must be guaranteed in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements."

Vice Premier Chen Yi made the above remarks at a reception held tonight by Phạm Bình, Chargé d'affaires of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In his speech, he said: "Like other socialist countries, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a peace-loving country. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam strictly abides by the Geneva Agreements, actively strives for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and persistently contributes to easing international tensions. However, U.S. imperialism adheres to its policies of war and aggression. It has not only consistently undermined the Geneva Agreements and obstructed the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, but also continuously created tensions in the Indochina region. Recently, the United States openly instigated the Lao government of Phoui Sananikone to violate the Geneva Agreements, abandon the Vientiane Agreements signed with the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, and provoke and expand the civil war. At the same time, the United States has, on the one hand, instigated Laos to conclude a series of agreements with Thailand and South Vietnam that are essentially military alliances, further incorporating Laos into U.S. military blocs. On the other hand, it has transported military personnel and weapons into Laos, establishing and expanding U.S. military bases and intelligence stations near the Chinese and Vietnamese borders. As a participating country of the Geneva Conference and a close neighbor of Laos, China firmly maintains that: The U.S. activities threatening the security of China and Vietnam and endangering the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia must be stopped, the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements must be observed, and the independence, unity, and peaceful neutrality of Laos must be guaranteed in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements. In order to cover up their aggressive activities and other ulterior motives, imperialists and reactionaries of various countries are accustomed to slandering socialist countries for engaging in aggression and interference, and recently they have been particularly brazen in carrying out such slanders against China. However, a single hand cannot cover the eyes and ears of all people. China never infringes upon other countries, nor will it tolerate infringement by other countries. In international affairs, we have always advocated resolving disputes between countries through peaceful negotiations, and have always advocated peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems. This is our firm and unwavering policy, and no amount of rumors or slanders can erase it."

Vice Premier Chen Yi's words were warmly applauded by Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd. Phạm Bình, Chargé d'affaires of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, held a grand reception at the embassy this evening to warmly celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Premier Zhou Enlai was invited to attend the reception.

Phạm Bình, Chargé d'affaires, spoke first at the beginning of the reception. In his speech, he introduced the brilliant achievements of the Vietnamese people in socialist construction. Phạm Bình said that in the past we were a backward agricultural country, and now we are laying the foundation for building our country's industry. In the first half of this year, the total output value of state-owned industries has increased by 80.9% compared with the same period last year. In agriculture, so far more than 90% of farmers have joined mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives. The rice production in 1959 will increase by nearly three times compared with the pre-war rice production in 1939.

Phạm Bình said that in the jubilant upsurge of building the motherland, the Vietnamese people never forget that half of our country is still divided, and our compatriots in South Vietnam are living under the fascist rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, a lackey of U.S. imperialism. This clique is blatantly undermining the Geneva Agreements, turning South Vietnam into a colony and military base of U.S. imperialism. But no matter how vicious and frenzied the U.S.-Ngo clique is, they cannot stop the Vietnamese people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland.

Phạm Bình then spoke about the situation in Laos, pointing out that due to the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Phoui Sananikone government openly violated the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements, launched and expanded the civil war in Laos, and carried out provocations on the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. All this seriously and directly threatens the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, exacerbates tensions in the Indochina region, and threatens peace in Southeast Asia and the world. As a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Laos and a country with a border of more than 1,000 kilometers with Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is determined to fight to uphold the Geneva Agreements, maintain good neighborly relations, and prevent U.S. imperialism from turning Laos into its military base and acts of intervention in preparation for war. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has called on the countries concerned to take measures to restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos and to stop the current serious situation in Laos.

Finally, Phạm Bình warmly congratulated the fraternal cooperation between Vietnam and China on the beautiful development in all aspects, and talked about China's assistance to Vietnam's construction cause. Phạm Bình also said: The great achievements of China in the Great Leap Forward movement and other construction aspects are a powerful encouragement to the Vietnamese people. China's construction experience is also extremely valuable for the Vietnamese people's socialist construction cause.

Vice Premier Chen Yi then spoke at the reception. At the beginning of his speech, he first extended the warmest congratulations to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity in the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and have achieved great successes. After the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese people only spent three years to successfully complete the economic recovery work in northern Vietnam, and since 1958, they have confidently embarked on the three-year plan for national economic construction. Over the past year, the industrial and agricultural production of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made great progress. In agriculture, following the great autumn harvest last year, an even greater harvest was achieved this summer; basic construction in industry is also developing vigorously like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and the industrial output value has increased rapidly. Now, the industrial and agricultural production of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has greatly exceeded the pre-war level, and the people's living standards have been greatly improved. Vice Premier Chen Yi said: Contrary to the situation in northern Vietnam, the economy of South Vietnam has long been in a state of paralysis, industrial and agricultural production is declining, and the people's lives are extremely impoverished. This once again eloquently proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the Vietnamese people on the great achievements they have made on all fronts, and wish the Vietnamese people even more brilliant achievements in the future cause of socialist construction.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi condemned the crime of U.S. imperialism in instigating the Phoui Sananikone government of Laos to provoke and expand the civil war in Laos.

Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that the peoples of China and Vietnam have a long tradition of friendship. This friendship has been continuously consolidated and strengthened in the common struggle of the two peoples for the independence and liberation of their motherlands, against imperialist aggression, and for the defense of peace. Now, we are also very pleased to see that in the past year, our two governments and peoples have carried out fraternal mutual assistance, cooperation, and mutual support in the cause of building socialism. There is no doubt that with the vigorous development of the construction cause of the two countries, the friendly mutual assistance and cooperation between our two peoples will be further strengthened and consolidated.

At the reception, Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Cheng Qian, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, President of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association Yang Xiufeng and other leaders, all raised their glasses to Chargé d'affaires Phạm Bình to congratulate the Vietnamese people on their glorious festival.

Responsible persons of various departments of our government, people's organizations, and democratic parties, senior generals of the People's Liberation Army, and envoys of various countries to China were all invited to attend today's reception.

    陈毅副总理在越大使馆招待会上谴责美国挑起和扩大老挝内战
    美国威胁中越安全的活动必须制止
    中国从不侵犯别国，也决不容忍别国侵犯，帝国主义和各国反动派的诬蔑决不能掩盖天下人耳目
    范平临时代办强调越南人民坚决为维护日内瓦协议进行斗争
    新华社2日讯　陈毅副总理今天说：“作为日内瓦会议的参加国和老挝的近邻，中国坚决主张：美国威胁中越两国安全、危害印度支那和东南亚地区和平的活动必须制止，日内瓦协议和万象协议必须遵守，老挝的独立、统一和和平中立的地位必须按照日内瓦协议的规定得到保证。”
    陈毅副总理的上述讲话，是他在今晚越南驻中国大使馆临时代办范平为越南民主共和国成立十四周年而举行的招待会上讲的。他在讲话中说：“越南民主共和国和其他社会主义国家一样，是热爱和平的国家。越南民主共和国严格地遵守日内瓦协议，积极地为越南的和平统一而努力，并且坚持不懈地为和缓国际紧张局势作出贡献。但是，美帝国主义却坚持它的战争和侵略政策，它不但一贯破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的和平统一，并且不断在印度支那地区制造紧张局势。最近美国又公然唆使老挝萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议，背弃它同前寮国战斗部队签订的万象协议，挑起并扩大内战。与此同时，美国一方面策动老挝同泰国、南越缔结一系列实质上带有军事联盟性质的协定，进一步把老挝纳入美国的军事集团，另一方面又把军事人员和武器运入老挝，在靠近中越的边境建立和扩大美国的军事基地和特务派遣站。作为日内瓦会议的参加国和老挝的近邻，中国坚决主张：美国威胁中越两国安全、危害印度支那和东南亚地区和平的活动必须制止，日内瓦协议和万象协议必须遵守，老挝的独立、统一和和平中立的地位必须按照日内瓦协议的规定得到保证。帝国主义和各国反动派，为了掩盖自己的侵略活动和其他不可告人的目的，惯于诬蔑社会主义国家进行侵略和干涉，而最近以来特别放肆地对中国进行这种诬蔑。但是，一手不能掩盖天下人的耳目。中国从不侵犯别国，也决不容忍别国的侵犯，在国际事务中，我们一向主张通过和平谈判解决国与国之间的争端，一向主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处、和平竞赛。这是我们坚定不移的政策，任何造谣诬蔑都是抹煞不了的。”
    陈毅副总理的这些话，博得出席招待会的中外人士的热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    新华社2日讯　越南驻中国大使馆临时代办范平今天晚间在大使馆举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝越南民主共和国成立十四周年。
    周恩来总理应邀出席了招待会。
    范平临时代办在招待会开始时首先讲话。他在讲话中介绍了越南人民在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就。范平说，过去我们是一个落后的农业国，而现在，我们正在为建设我国的工业而奠定基础。今年上半年和去年同期比较，国营工业总产值已增长了80.9％。在农业方面，到目前为止已有90％以上的农户参加了变工互助组和农业合作社。1959年的稻谷产量将比战前1939年的稻谷产量增长近三倍。
    范平说，在欢欣鼓舞地建设祖国的热潮中，越南人民从不忘记我们的一半国土还被分割着，我们南越的同胞正生活在美帝国主义的走狗吴庭艳集团的法西斯制度下。这个集团正在明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议，把南越变为美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。但是不管美吴集团穷凶极恶和疯狂到什么程度，他们也阻挡不了越南人民争取祖国统一的事业的斗争。
    范平接着在讲话中谈到老挝局势时指出，由于美帝国主义的唆使，培·萨纳尼空政府公然破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，在老挝发动和扩大内战，并在越南民主共和国边境进行挑衅，这一切严重地直接地威胁着越南民主共和国，加剧了印度支那地区的紧张局势，威胁着东南亚和世界和平。作为关于老挝的日内瓦协议的签字国，和老挝有着长达一千多公里边界的国家，越南民主共和国坚决为维护日内瓦协议，维护睦邻关系，并为制止美帝国主义企图把老挝变为它的军事基地和准备战争的干涉行为而斗争。越南民主共和国政府曾经呼吁有关各国采取措施，恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，制止目前老挝的严重局势。
    范平最后在讲话中热烈祝贺越中两国兄弟般的合作在各方面获得的美好发展，谈到了中国对越南建设事业的援助。范平还说：中国在大跃进运动中和其他建设方面所获得的伟大成就，对于越南人民来说是一个强有力的鼓舞。中国的建设经验对于越南人民的社会主义建设事业也是极其宝贵的。
    陈毅副总理接着在招待会上讲话。他在讲话开始时首先代表中国政府和中国人民，向越南民主共和国政府和越南人民表示最热烈的祝贺。
    陈毅副总理说：在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，越南人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业中，发挥了高度的劳动热情和创造精神，并且取得了巨大的成就。越南人民在和平恢复后，仅仅用了三年的时间，就胜利地完成了越南北方的经济恢复工作，而且从1958年起又满怀信心地开始了国民经济建设的三年计划。一年来，越南民主共和国的工农业生产都获得了很大发展。农业方面，继去年秋季的大丰收，今年夏季又获得了更大的丰收；工业方面的基本建设也正如雨后春笋似的在蓬勃发展，工业产值有了迅速的增长。现在，越南民主共和国的工农业生产已大大超过了战前水平，人民生活得到很大改善。陈毅副总理说：与越南北方的情况相反，南越的经济则长期处于瘫痪状态，工农业生产日益衰退，人民的生活极端贫困。这就再一次雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。中国人民热烈地祝贺越南人民在各个战线上取得的伟大成绩，并且预祝越南人民在今后的社会主义建设事业中获得更加辉煌的成就。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中谴责美帝国主义唆使老挝萨纳尼空政府挑起并扩大老挝内战的罪行。
  陈毅副总理着重指出：中越两国人民有着悠久的传统友谊。这种友谊在两国人民为祖国的独立和解放、为反对帝国主义的侵略和保卫和平的共同斗争中，得到不断的巩固和加强。现在，我们又十分高兴地看到，近一年来，我们两国政府和人民在建设社会主义事业中，进行了兄弟般的互助合作和相互支持。毫无疑问，随着两国建设事业的蓬勃发展，我们两国人民的友好互助合作关系，必将得到进一步的加强和巩固。
    在招待会上，国务院副总理李先念，人大常委会副委员长李济深、程潜、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席李四光，国防委员会副主席张治中，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，中越友好协会会长杨秀峰等负责人，都举杯向范平临时代办祝贺越南人民的光辉节日。
    我国政府各部门、各人民团体和民主党派的负责人，人民解放军高级将领，以及各国驻中国使节，都应邀出席了今天的招待会。
