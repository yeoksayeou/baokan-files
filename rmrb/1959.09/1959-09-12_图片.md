To help readers understand the background of the illegal so-called McMahon Line, the following two maps are now published:

    Above Map—This is a photograph of the original map attached to the secret exchange of notes between British representative McMahon and the Tibetan local authorities in Delhi, India, on March 24, 1914, without the knowledge of the Chinese Central Government. The original map has two parts, left and right, each bearing the signatures of McMahon and the representative of the Tibetan local authorities, Lunxing Xiatola. The Tibetan-Indian boundary line shown on the map (i.e., the so-called McMahon Line) illegally assigns territory of approximately 90,000 square kilometers south of the line, which has always belonged to China, to British India. This exchange of notes and attached map are completely illegal and invalid.

    Right Map—This is a photograph of the original map attached to the Simla Treaty signed by representatives of the British and Tibetan local authorities on July 3, 1914. The gray line on the map (originally a blue line) represents the boundary between so-called Inner and Outer Tibet, and the black line (originally a red line) represents the boundary between Tibet and other parts of China. The so-called McMahon Line appears on this map as part of the boundary between Tibet and other parts of China, i.e., part of the black line (originally a red line), and is not marked at all as the boundary line between the Tibetan region of China and India. Moreover, the Tibetan-Indian border issue was not discussed at the Simla Conference, and there are no provisions regarding the Tibetan-Indian border in the treaty's text. The Simla Treaty and its attached map bear only the signatures of representatives from the British and Tibetan local authorities, and were not signed and ratified by the Chinese Central Government. Our country has always refused to recognize them. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    为了帮助读者了解非法的所谓麦克马洪线的背景情况，现在发表以下两份地图：
    上图——是1914年3月24日英国代表麦克马洪和西藏地方当局瞒着中国中央政府在印度德里秘密换文的附图的原件照片。附图原件有左右两张，每张上都有麦克马洪和西藏地方当局的代表伦兴夏托拉的签字。图上所示藏、印分界线（即所谓麦克马洪线）把线南向来属于中国，面积约九万平方公里的领土划归英属印度。这个换文和附图是完全非法的，无效的。
    右图——是1914年7月3日英国和西藏地方当局代表签订的西姆拉条约附图原件的照片。图上灰线（原图上为蓝线）表示所谓内、外藏的界线，黑线（原图上为红线）表示西藏同中国其他部分之间的界线。所谓麦克马洪线在这张地图上是以西藏同中国其他部分之间的界线的一部分，即黑线（原图上红线）的一部分出现的，完全没有被标明是中国西藏地方同印度之间的疆界线。而且西姆拉会议上也并没有讨论过藏、印边界问题，条约的条文中也没有关于藏、印边界的规定。西姆拉条约及其附图只有英国和西藏地方当局代表的签字，并未经中国中央政府签订和批准，我国向来拒绝承认。（新华社稿）
