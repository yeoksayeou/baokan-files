Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: During the bantamweight weightlifting competition at the First National Games held on the evening of the 15th, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region athlete You Jiadong, on his fourth snatch attempt, broke the national record of 103 kilograms held by Sichuan athlete Chen Jiafu with a result of 103.5 kilograms. To date, Chinese weightlifters have broken twelve national records this year, accounting for nearly one-half of all twenty-eight national weightlifting records.

You Jiadong won the national bantamweight title today after a hard-fought battle, edging out People's Liberation Army athlete Yang Zhaoquan by 2.5 kilograms. His total score was 317.5 kilograms, while Yang Zhaoquan's was 315 kilograms.

The competition in this weight class was very intense today. The total scores of the third-place finisher, Yu Zhuquan from Guangdong, the fourth-place finisher, Yin Guohua from Beijing, and the fifth-place finisher, Cheng Qigang from Anhui, were all 305 kilograms. The total scores of the sixth-place finisher, Wu Maotou, and the seventh-place finisher, Wang Houqing, were both 302.5 kilograms. The final rankings were determined solely based on the differences in their body weights (the lighter athlete ranked higher). (Attached picture)

    次轻量级举重比赛结束
    尤家栋抓举破全国纪录
    新华社15日讯　第一届全国运动会15日晚在举行次轻量级举重比赛时，内蒙古自治区选手尤家栋在第四次抓举时，以一百零三点五公斤的成绩，打破了四川选手陈家富保持的一百零三公斤的全国纪录。至此，我国举重选手今年以来已经打破了十二项全国纪录，占全部二十八项举重全国纪录将近二分之一。
    尤家栋今天经过艰苦奋战，才以二点五公斤的优势赢了解放军选手杨兆权，取得了次轻量级全国冠军的称号。他的总成绩是三百一十七点五公斤，杨兆权是三百一十五公斤。
    今天这个等级的举重比赛争夺十分紧张，第三名广东余祝权、第四名北京殷国华、第五名安徽承其钢的总成绩同是三百○五公斤，第六名邬毛头、第七名王厚庆的总成绩同是三百○二点五公斤，最后只是根据他们体重上的差异（体重轻的名次在先），才定出名次的。（附图片）
