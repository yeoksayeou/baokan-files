Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 25th: In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, over 7.8 million mu of mid-season rice are mostly ripe and golden. Across the region, the broad masses of commune members are wielding their sickles to harvest quickly and meticulously, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Good news of widespread mid-season rice harvests are constantly coming from various places. In Nandan County, bordering Guizhou in northern Guangxi, the already harvested 31,000 mu of mid-season rice have an average yield increase of over 20% compared to last year, with over 5,200 mu achieving yields of over 800 jin per mu. In Guanyang County in the east, over 65,800 mu of mid-season rice have an average yield increase of over 12% compared to last year, with over 9,800 mu achieving yields of over 700 jin per mu. In Ziyuan County, located in a high and cold mountainous area, people of all ethnic groups, under the unified leadership of the commune, overcame poor mountains and bad waters and achieved a large-scale increase in mid-season rice production. The 27,000 mu harvested earlier have an average yield of over 500 jin per mu, an increase of 15% compared to last year. In the Meixi Commune of this county, the cultivated land was previously short of water, and 3,800 mu could not be planted with mid-season rice. Some paddy fields had low yields due to cold water. After the establishment of the commune, a water conservancy project was built to irrigate nearly 2,000 mu, and 40,000 small canals were dug to drain cold water, expanding the planting area of mid-season rice and converting cold water fields into warm water fields. This year, the yield per mu of mid-season rice increased by 24% compared to last year. In Longlin Autonomous County, located in the western part of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the mid-season rice is turning from green to yellow, and the already harvested 14,000 mu of mid-season rice have also increased in yield compared to last year.

Inspired by the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the cadres and members of the people's communes in various places have greater enthusiasm, and the mid-season rice harvest is proceeding quickly and well. In areas where mid-season rice ripened earlier, a harvest competition was widely launched under the slogan of "Go all out, harvest the mid-season rice to welcome National Day, and present the golden grains of harvest to National Day." Many plains and mountainous areas, advanced teams and backward teams, and teams with large tasks and teams with small tasks carried out labor cooperation and mutual support. The Fushi Commune in Rong'an County launched a competition, increasing the harvesting progress from 0.8 fen per person per day to 1.8 mu per person per day. The Yingshan Commune in Luzhai County carried out large-scale collaboration, and all 17,000 mu of mid-season rice were harvested in just four days.

Commune members cherish the fruits of their labor in the harvest and have come up with many methods for careful harvesting and threshing. People's communes in Nandan County generally practice light cutting and placement, heavy beating and multiple turning, and multiple beating and winnowing, and organize the elderly and children to pick up lost grains, covering the threshing floor with mats and bed sheets. Through such careful harvesting and threshing, about 15 to 20 jin of rice can be harvested per mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 24th: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has announced the good news of a bumper harvest of over 13 million mu of winter and spring wheat this year. According to the abundant harvest materials reported from various places, this year there are over 120,000 mu of wheat with a yield of over 500 jin per mu; over 8,500 mu with a yield of over 800 jin per mu; and over 5,400 mu with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. According to actual threshing and predicted accounting in various places, the total output has increased by more than 25% compared to the bumper harvest year of 1958.

This year's summer bumper harvest in the autonomous region is a glorious victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction and is the result of the arduous struggle of people's communes in various places in implementing the policy of planting more and harvesting more and the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

Due to the advantages of large-scale production of people's communes in various places, rational organization of labor to reclaim a large amount of wasteland and utilize fallow land; and carrying out large-scale land consolidation movements, breaking the boundaries between the original advanced cooperatives, digging and filling old dikes and waste channels, etc., the sowing area of winter and spring wheat in the autonomous region has increased by more than 20% compared to last year, and has doubled compared to 1949.

People's communes and state-owned farms in various places have vigorously grasped the sowing quality and field management measures, making significant improvements in the autumn sowing of winter wheat. The winter wheat stubble land is generally deeply plowed to more than 20 centimeters, and the fallow land has mostly been deeply plowed in the summer. The area of deep plowing reaches more than half of the winter wheat sowing area. The amount of base fertilizer applied generally reaches about 10,000 jin per mu, an increase of about two times compared to the previous year, and reasonable close planting has been universally implemented, with about 28 jin of seeds sown per mu, and 70% of the wheat is sown in a timely manner. After the winter wheat emerged from the soil, people's communes in various places immediately grasped the pre-winter management, seedling inspection, and seedling replenishment work. 80% of the winter wheat land was winter irrigated. In previous years, no top dressing or very little top dressing was applied before winter, but last year the area of top dressing before winter reached 20%. During the key periods of returning to green, jointing, heading, flowering, and grain filling, fertilizer and water were added in a timely manner, weeds were removed in a timely manner, and several movements to eliminate Category III seedlings were launched to promote the healthy growth of wheat with large ears and full grains.

People's communes have shown great advantages in water conservancy construction, flood prevention, and pest and disease control. Various places have carried out large-scale reconstruction projects of old irrigation canals, built more than a dozen large-scale water conservancy projects such as the Xikeer Reservoir in Jiashi, the Kadasugeti Reservoir in Shule, and the Kunlun Grand Canal in Yutian, and implemented water conservation and planned water use, basically avoiding the flood and drought disasters in wheat fields. This year, relatively serious rust and aphid infestations occurred in some areas of southern and northern Xinjiang. People's communes organized large-scale joint prevention and collaboration, self-made native pesticides and native pesticide application equipment, and quickly overcame pests and diseases, ensuring a bumper harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 24th: The rice paddies on both banks of the Yellow River in Ningxia are golden, and the millet under the Liupan Mountains is ripe. A scene of abundant harvest is presented on the vast plains from north to south.

In the past ten days, Hui and Han commune members in various places, in order to ensure a 100% yield and 100% harvest, men and women, old and young, have been working hard in the autumn harvest. Of the more than 5.8 million mu of various autumn crops in the entire autonomous region, more than 1.6 million mu have been harvested. Of the 820,000 mu of rice on both banks of the Yellow River, more than 300,000 mu have been harvested. Judging from the actual harvesting and threshing in various places, the average yield per mu of rice in the entire region can reach more than 400 jin, an increase of more than 30% compared to the bumper harvest year of 1958.

Inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Hui and Han commune members in various places have high attendance rates and high labor efficiency, making this year's autumn harvest faster and of better quality than in previous years. The people's communes in Zhongwei County, based on the characteristics of the relatively concentrated ripening period of rice, organized more than 32,000 people to carry out the autumn harvest using the method of large-scale corps operations. More than 3,000 cadres and students in the county also formed five major forces for harvesting, transportation, seed selection, threshing, and re-collection, making the autumn harvest orderly and completed on a contract basis. From the start of harvesting on the 10th to the 21st, all 77,700 mu of rice in the county have been harvested, of which 65,000 mu have been threshed, and 58,000 mu have been threshed, ten days earlier than last year. More than 5,000 elderly people and primary school students formed a re-collection force, following the harvesting team to fight in the fields, picking up lost ears and grains, ensuring that no grain is lost. The average yield per mu of rice in this county can reach about 450 jin. Pingluo County, based on the different ripening periods of rice and other miscellaneous grains, adopted the method of mutual assistance and cooperation, mutual assistance and support, harvesting the ripe crops first, and harvesting the late-ripening crops later, to solve the difficulty of insufficient rural labor. During the autumn harvest, the first secretaries of the party committees at all levels personally took command. For example, Zhu Yuande, the first secretary of the Ning'an Commune Party Committee in Zhongning, after going deep into the small teams to participate in the autumn harvest, discovered shortcomings such as incomplete threshing, and promptly notified the teams so that everyone could correct them in time.

Various autumn crops in Xiji, Guyuan, and other counties under the Liupan Mountains are generally growing well, except for some disaster-stricken areas. At present, millet and miscellaneous grains have ripened and are being harvested intensively. More than 7,000 Hui and Han commune members in more than 200 production brigades in various communes in Xiji County have also launched a labor competition for careful harvesting and threshing. People's communes in Guyuan County have rectified canteens and nurseries before the autumn harvest, so that most women can easily invest in the autumn harvest. The Jiaocha Commune also established mobile canteens, saving commune members time to travel back and forth and greatly improving the efficiency of the autumn harvest. (Attached photos)

    各族人民用公社化的累累果实向国庆献礼
    广西新疆宁夏稻麦大丰收
    新华社南宁25日电　广西僮族自治区七百八十多万亩中稻大都黄熟，全区广大社员正挥镰抢收，快收细打，迎接建国十周年。中稻大面积丰收的喜报，不断从各地传来。在广西北部同贵州接壤的南丹县，已收割的三万一千多亩中稻，平均亩产量比去年增加两成多，其中有五千二百多亩产量达到八百斤以上。东部灌阳县有六万五千八百多亩中稻，平均亩产比去年增加一成二以上，亩产七百斤以上的有九千八百多亩。地处高寒山区的资源县，各族人民在公社统一领导下，战胜穷山恶水，取得了中稻大面积增产，全县早收的二万七千多亩，平均亩产达五百多斤，比去年增产一成半。这个县的梅溪公社，以往的耕地缺水，有三千八百亩无法栽种中稻，有些水田又因水冷，产量很低；公社成立后，修了可灌溉近二千亩的水利工程，开了四万条排除冷水的小水圳，扩大了中稻栽种面积，又把冷水田改成了暖水田，今年中稻单位面积产量比去年增加了二成四。位居云贵高原的西部隆林各族自治县，中稻正由青转黄，已收的一万四千多亩中稻也都比去年增产。
    各地人民公社干部和社员在党的八届八中全会决议精神的鼓舞下，干劲更大，中稻收割进行得又快又好。中稻黄熟较早的地区，在“鼓干劲，收完中稻迎国庆，拿丰收的金谷向国庆献礼”的口号下，广泛开展了收割竞赛。很多平原与山区、先进队与落后队，任务大的队与任务小的队开展了劳动协作，互相支援。融安县浮石公社开展竞赛，收割进度从每人日割八分提高到日割一亩八分。鹿寨县英山公社开展大协作，一万七千多亩中稻仅四天就全部收净。
    社员们在收割中十分珍惜自己的劳动成果，想出了很多细收细打的办法。南丹县各人民公社普遍做到轻割轻放、重打多翻、多打多扬，并组织老人小孩拣漏谷，在打谷场周围铺上席子和被单。经过这样的细收细打，每亩大约可以多收稻谷十五斤到二十斤。
    新华社乌鲁木齐24日电　新疆维吾尔自治区今年一千三百多万亩冬春小麦传出大丰收的喜报。根据各地已经报来的丰产材料，今年小麦亩产五百斤以上的有十二万多亩；亩产八百斤以上的有八千五百多亩；亩产千斤以上的有五千四百多亩。据各地实打和预测核算：总产量比大丰收的1958年增加25％以上。
    今年自治区的夏季大丰收，是党的社会主义建设总路线的辉煌胜利，是各地人民公社贯彻执行多种多收的方针和农业“八字宪法”，经过艰苦奋战的结果。
    由于各地人民公社发挥大规模生产的优越性，合理组织劳动力大量开荒和利用轮歇地；开展大规模的整地运动，打破了原来高级社之间的界线，挖填了旧地埂、废水渠等等，使自治区冬春小麦的播种面积比去年增加20％以上，比1949年扩大了一倍。
    各地人民公社和国营农场狠抓了播种质量和田间管理措施，使秋播冬麦工作有了显著改进。冬麦茬地一般都深耕在二十厘米以上，轮歇地大都经过伏耕。深耕面积达到冬麦播种面积一半以上。施基肥的数量一般达到每亩万斤左右，比上年增加约两倍，并且普遍实行了合理密植，下种每亩在二十八斤左右，有70％的小麦作到了适时播种。各地人民公社在冬麦出土后，立即抓紧了越冬前管理、查苗、补苗工作，80％的冬麦地实行了冬灌；往年冬前不追肥或很少追肥，去年冬前追肥面积达20％。在返青、拔节抽穗、扬花灌浆等各个关键时期，又抓紧加肥、加水，及时除草，多次掀起了消灭三类苗运动，促使小麦生长健壮，穗大粒饱。
    在兴修水利、防洪和防治病虫害方面，人民公社更显示出了巨大的优越性。各地大规模地进行了旧灌渠的改建工程，兴建了伽师的西柯尔水库，疏勒的卡达苏盖提水库和于田的昆仑大渠等十几项大型水利工程，实行节约用水和计划用水，基本上避免了水浇麦田的洪、旱灾害。今年南北疆部分地区发生了较严重的锈病和蚜虫，人民公社组织了大联防、大协作，自制土农药、土药械，很快就战胜了病虫害，保住了大丰收。
    新华社银川24日电　宁夏黄河两岸水稻金黄，六盘山下糜谷成熟，从北到南的广阔原野上，都呈现着一片丰收景象。
    近十日来，各地人民公社的回、汉族社员，为了保证做到十成产量十成收，男女老少都紧张地投入秋收。全自治区的五百八十多万亩各种秋季作物，有一百六十多万亩已经收割。黄河两岸的八十二万亩水稻，也有三十多万亩已经收割。从各地收割、打场的实际情况看，全区水稻平均亩产量可以达到四百斤以上，比大丰收的1958年，增产三成以上。
    各地人民公社的回、汉族社员，在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召鼓舞下，出勤多，劳动效率高，使今年的秋收比往年进展快，质量好的中卫县各人民公社根据水稻成熟期较为集中的特点，组织了三万二千多人，用大兵团作战的方法进行秋收，县里的三千多名机关干部和学生也组成了收割、运输、选种、打场、复收等五路大军，使秋收有条不紊，包干完成。从10日开镰到21日，全县七万七千七百多亩水稻已全部割完，其中六万五千亩登场，五万八千亩已经打完，比去年提早了十天。五千多个老人和小学生组成的复收大军，跟随收割队转战田间，拣拾丢穗漏粒，保证颗粒不失。这个县的水稻平均亩产量可以达到四百五十斤左右。平罗县则根据水稻和其他杂粮成熟期有早有晚的情况，采取了互助协作，互助支援，先熟先割，后熟后割的办法进行秋收，解决农村劳动力不足的困难。在秋收中，各级党委都由第一书记亲自挂帅。如中宁宁安公社党委第一书记朱元德，深入到小队参加秋收后，便发现打场不细等缺点，就及时地通知各队，使大家能及时纠正。
    六盘山下的西吉、固原等县的各种秋季作物，除一些受灾地区外，一般庄稼生长良好。目前糜谷杂粮已经成熟，正在紧张抢收。西吉县各公社二百多个生产大队的七千多名回、汉族社员，还展开了细收细打的劳动竞赛。固原县各人民公社在秋收前都整顿了食堂、托儿所，使绝大部分妇女都轻松地投入了秋收。交岔公社还举办了随营食堂，节省了社员往返的时间，大大提高了秋收效率。（附图片）
