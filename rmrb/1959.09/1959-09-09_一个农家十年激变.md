A Peasant Family's Decade of Dramatic Change
By our reporter Wen Ying

The Wang Luoxiang family in the old society was like a solitary tree swaying in the wind and rain, but now it has become a vigorous cell of the people's commune. The countryside, composed of millions of such families, is full of vitality and moving towards a better future on the road of communization.

Coming away from the Wang Luoxiang family, my excitement and emotion lingered for a long time. This old man, who has escaped a life of hunger and cold, told me that he had lived for a full fifty years. "The first forty years I crawled, the last ten years I stood up and ran. The tastes of bitterness and sweetness are very different." He deeply felt that without truly understanding the suffering of the past, one could not truly appreciate the sweetness of today.

The Wang Luoxiang family is an ordinary family in the Nan Huitong Production Team of the Han Jiawa Commune in Ding County, Hebei. When I visited their home, it happened to coincide with the family winning an award at the autumn field management competition in the entire management area. This is the third time this family has enjoyed the honor of being a "model family" this year. The reason for this award is as follows: In early August, there were two heavy rains in a row, and a small part of the commune's crops were flooded. The commune party committee called for "no reduction in production despite the disaster, and a good harvest even after flooding." The solutions were drainage, loosening the soil, and topdressing. Because the team did not have enough fertilizer, he mobilized his sons and daughters-in-law to dismantle three old earthen beds in the house overnight to use as fertilizer. During the day, he, his sons, and his daughters-in-law worked in the fields all day long to drain water and topdress, not even wanting to go home for meals. This kind of drive and style played a role in promoting the struggle against disaster and to ensure a good harvest.

              The Old Man Talks About the Past and Present

At the south end of the village, nestled among green trees, is a row of new brick houses with sunny doors and windows. This is the home of Wang Luoxiang. In the courtyard, there is a small vegetable garden. Green chives, purple eggplants, loofah, beans, tomatoes, and other seasonal vegetables are all available. In addition, there are more than ten jujube trees, peach trees, apricot trees, and prickly ash trees. Noteworthy is the apple tree, as thick as a teacup, which bore a large apple for the first time. This place is truly like a small park, exuding an enticing fragrance.

The old man likes to talk about the old days. Uncle Wang told me about his unforgettable past. He became an orphan at the age of six. From the age of nine, he worked for the landlord during the day and lived in a dilapidated temple at night. He pointed to a house across the street and said, "The dilapidated temple used to be there. Now a club has been built." When talking about the past, he remembers hunger. Uncle Wang told such a story: When he was twenty years old, his aunt married her daughter to him. Several years later, they had several children. One autumn, the harvest was very poor, and they couldn't even pay the rent for the few acres of land they leased. The whole family only ate twenty catties of dwarf beans in forty days. At that time, they had to rely on tree leaves to fill their stomachs. Collecting tree leaves became the main task of the children's mother. He pointed to Wang Da Niang, who was cooking, and said, "She is a capable person. She picked all the leaves off many trees. The nickname 'Queen of Tree Climbing' was given to her at that time."

At noon, the sons and daughters-in-law who had been working in the fields came back to rest. The family gathered together, lively, joyful, and filled with a happy atmosphere. This family has more than ten people. The eldest son, Haishui, works in a construction company. He sometimes comes back to visit, bringing the whole family good news about the great development of the construction industry. The second son, Jiangshui, was newly elected as the deputy secretary of the production team's party branch and deputy leader of the team. He often talked about the party's policies and his new experiments in agricultural technology. The third son is in elementary school. The daughter, Xiao Que, works in the commune's power plant. Her words often contained some difficult-to-understand electromechanical terms. The two daughters-in-law, Yinguo and Junzhuo, are both active members of the production team. They often talk about the stories of the villagers in the production competition, which everyone is very interested in. As for the lively and healthy three grandsons, Uncle Wang said that these are the little generals who are preparing to participate in the construction of communism in the future. This prosperous family, gathered together, truly has endless happiness to talk about.

When we discussed the current life, Wang Da Niang said that the food, clothing, and utensils now are many times better than when she got married. She said, "In the past, we couldn't make ends meet every other day. Now, we have rice and noodles three times a day. Nowadays, young people often wear foreign socks and fine cloth clothes, and wash their faces with scented soap. I never enjoyed this blessing when I got married." She counted on her fingers, and said that she now spent more than two hundred yuan a year on clothing, accessories, and pocket money. Her son just bought a bicycle, and her daughter wants to buy a pair of headphones (crystal radio). Speaking of this, Wang Da Niang lectured the family again: "I often say that even though life is easier, we still have to be frugal."

          The Rising Sun Rises Higher and Higher

According to Uncle Wang, his family's situation is like a newly rising sun, rising higher and higher. In 1949, the last year of individual farming, the total income of the whole family was 370 yuan; in 1951, during the mutual aid group period, the income was 403 yuan; in 1953, when they joined the elementary cooperative, the income was 492 yuan; in 1956, during the advanced cooperative period, the income was 708 yuan; in 1958, the first year of the people's commune, the income was 782 yuan.

These figures show the changes in the life of this family and the entire countryside over ten years and five stages of development. When Uncle Wang talked about these changes, he said that land reform was like pushing down a big mountain that was pressing on his body. From the day he was allocated land, he felt that he stood up. Poor people had land, like fish seeing water, desperately plowing and planting the land. If the wealthy middle peasants applied fine fertilizer, he would apply coarse fertilizer in double quantity. Because of the lack of livestock and carts, and being weak with limited manpower, he said, "At that time, I still felt unsure, and my back was not straight."

Chairman Mao pointed out the road of mutual aid and cooperation for farmers across the country to get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity, which could just cure Wang Luoxiang's "symptoms" at that time. He and six poor peasants formed a mutual aid group. Water helps fish, and fish helps water, which was much better than individual farming. However, there were only a few small livestock in the group, and production was still difficult. Later, their group and Ma Baoshan's group combined to form an elementary cooperative of sixteen households. Everyone pooled money to buy a large livestock, which was a great and happy event. Wang Luoxiang saw that the organized strength was great, and he was full of confidence in the cooperative. As long as it was beneficial to the cooperative, he would do it. When the cooperative wanted to engage in sideline production, he took the lead in handing over the cotton gin to the cooperative. In order to solve the problem of funds and raw materials for sideline production, he took out two stones of wheat and cotton seeds and agricultural tools. In one winter and spring, he earned back two large livestock, and agricultural production also improved. As the tide rises, the boat floats higher. Production developed and income increased. In these two years, Wang Luoxiang built and added six new brick houses. However, Uncle Wang said, "Because the cooperative was small, production did not increase quickly, and everyone felt that working like this was not as satisfying as it could be." Later, nine villages organized an advanced cooperative, which was even stronger. The cooperative dug machine wells, bought a locomotive boiler, added strong livestock, and made new agricultural tools. Production became more and more prosperous. Last year, during the Great Leap Forward, everyone felt that if they wanted to develop production in an all-round way, it was not enough to rely solely on agricultural cooperatives. So, they established people's communes.

Speaking of the commune, Uncle Wang was particularly excited. He said, "Now that we have the commune, even the locomotive boiler is considered backward. We are already using electric power to pump water for irrigation."

Originally, this commune had built a thermal power plant. Rows of newly erected power poles stretched into the distance. The sound of motors came from the pumping stations. There were no livestock and no people on the well platform, and the water in the canals flowed gurglingly into the fields. The commune also had a tractor station. The land had been leveled, squared, and deep plowed, and production had made a great leap forward. Uncle Wang's daughter, Xiao Que, took the opportunity of this Great Leap Forward to leave school and go to work at the commune's power plant. In just over a year, this eighteen-year-old rural girl had skillfully mastered the technology of operating and maintaining generators and repairing circuits.

Cultivation and irrigation have progressed from manpower and animal power to the use of tractors and electricity. The average yield per mu has increased from 200 catties in 1949, 250 catties in 1951, 340 catties in 1953, and 391 catties in 1956, to 545 catties last year.

"In the final analysis, without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we wouldn't have the good life we have today." Uncle Wang clenched his fist and said, "We will resolutely follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we won't be wrong." Like other peasants, he reached this most fundamental conclusion.

          Love for the Collective, Everyone Strives Upward

Uncle Wang's words also explain why this family is so motivated and has such a strong love for the collective. When Wang Luoxiang works, he doesn't feel hungry or sleepy. Many commune members say that he is particularly concerned about the big and small affairs of the commune. One midnight during the wheat harvest this year, a rainstorm struck. He went around the streets calling on the commune members to go to the wheat field to protect the stacks. There were no mats to cover the wheat stacks, so he hurried home and tore off the reed mats from his bed. His son, Jiangshui, learned the spirit of selflessness from his father. No matter the work or labor, wherever there is difficulty, he goes there. Recently, because of the heavy rain, the Mengliang River south of the village was in danger. He jumped into the rapids without fear of danger and insisted on plugging the breach.

Every member of this family wants to contribute to the team's increased production. They not only work actively, but also study diligently and delve into agricultural science and technology. Last year, there was such an interesting story: Jiangshui and a few young men created three mu of high-yield sweet potato experimental fields. His wife, Junzhuo, knew about it and also invited a few young women to create three mu of experimental fields. They declared a silent war, secretly competing. The young women watched what the young men did, and they did the same. As a result, Jiangshui's experimental fields yielded more than 20,000 catties per mu, while Junzhuo's experimental fields only yielded more than 17,000 catties per mu. She was very puzzled. After asking Jiangshui, she learned that they had applied different types of fertilizers, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, according to the different growth stages of the sweet potatoes. Although they applied a lot of fertilizer, it was not scientific. Jiangshui told her, "If you want high yields, you have to learn some scientific knowledge." Now, she also often reads some pamphlets on agricultural technology.

    一个农家十年激变
    本报记者　文英
    王洛香这个家庭在旧社会像飘摇在风雨中的孤树，现在变成人民公社一个富有生命力的细胞。由千百万个这样的家庭构成的农村，正在公社化的道路上，充满了活力，迈向更美好的未来。
    从王洛香家告别出来，兴奋激动的心情，许久不能平静下来。这位摆脱了饥寒生活的老人告诉我，他活了整整五十岁了，“前四十年是爬着走，后十年是站起来跑，一苦一甜，滋味大不一样。”他深深地感到，不真正懂得早先的苦，就不会真正体会到今天的甜。
    王洛香家是河北定县韩家洼公社南会同生产队的普通一家。我去他家访问的时候，正碰上这个家庭在全管理区秋田管理竞赛评比会上得了奖。这是他家今年第三次享受“模范家庭”的荣誉了。这一次得奖的原因是这样：8月上旬连落两场大雨，公社有一小部分庄稼被淹了。公社党委号召“有灾不减产，涝了也丰收”，办法是排水、松土、追肥。因为小队里肥料不够了，他就发动儿子、媳妇连夜拆了家里的三条旧坑，当作肥料。白天，他和儿子、媳妇整天在地里突击排水、追肥，连吃饭都不愿回家吃。这种干劲，这种风格，对抗灾保收运动起了推动作用。
              老人话今昔
    村南头，在绿树掩映中，有一排门窗向阳的新砖房，这就是王洛香的家。院子里，有一个小菜园。绿韭菜、紫茄子、丝瓜、豆角、西红柿等等应时的菜，应有尽有。另外，还有十多棵枣树、桃树、杏树和花椒树。引人注意的是那棵茶杯粗的苹果树，初次结了一个大苹果。这儿真像个小公园，散发着诱人的清香。
    老人喜欢谈谈老话。王大伯向我谈到他难以忘记的过去。六岁他就变成了孤儿，从九岁开始，白天给地主作活，晚上住在破庙里。他指着对面的一所房子说：“破庙原来就在那儿，现在修起了俱乐部。”提起过去，就想起挨饿来，王大伯讲了这样一个故事：在他二十岁那年，姨母把女儿嫁给了他。几年后，他们有了几个孩子。一年秋天，收成很不好，租的几亩地也交不出租。全家在四十天内，只吃了二十斤菀豆。当时，只好依靠树叶充饥。采树叶成了孩子妈妈的主要事情。他指着正在做饭的王大娘说：“她是个有本事的人，好些树都被她采光了，‘爬树王’这个外号，就是那时候人们送给她的。”
    中午，下地劳动的儿子、媳妇们回来歇晌了。这家人集在一起，热闹、欢乐，洋溢着幸福的气氛。这一家有十多口人，大儿海水在建筑公司工作，有时回来看看，带给全家很多建设事业大发展的好消息。二儿江水，新当选为生产队党支部副书记兼小队副队长，他常念道的是党的政策和他自己在农业技术上的新试验。三儿正上小学。姑娘小缺在公社发电厂工作，她说的话里，常带着一些难懂的机电名词。银果、俊琢两个儿媳妇，都是生产队的积极分子，她俩常常谈起社员在生产竞赛当中的一些故事，大家都很感兴趣。对于活泼健壮的三个小孙儿，王大伯说这是准备将来参加共产主义建设的小将。这兴旺的一家，集聚在一起，真是有说不尽的幸福。
    当我们议论到当前生活的时候，王大娘说，现在吃的、穿的、用的，比她结婚那会儿不知要强多少倍。她说：“过去，三天两头揭不开锅；现在，一天三顿米面。这会儿年轻人常穿洋袜子、细布衣，洗脸用香胰子。我结婚的时候，也没享过这个福。”她捏着指头算了算，穿的、戴的、零花的，现在一年就得二百多元。儿子刚买了一辆自行车，姑娘又要买个耳机子（矿石收音机）。说到这里，王大娘对着一家人又训起话来了：“我常说，日子从容了，也要省细着过。”
          初升的日头步步高
    按照王大伯的说法，他家的光景像是刚出来的日头，步步高升。1949年，是单干的最后一年，全家总收入是三百七十元；1951年，互助组时期，收入四百零三元；1953年，入了初级社，收入四百九十二元；1956年，高级社时期，收入七百零八元；1958年办起人民公社的第一年，收入七百八十二元。
    这些数字表明了这个家庭和整个农村生活，在十年间、五个发展阶段的变化。王大伯讲到这些变化的时候说，土地改革像推倒了压在身上的一座大山，从分了地那天起，他就觉得站起来了。穷人有了地，像鱼儿见了水，拼命的刨种土地。富裕中农施细肥，他就加倍地施粗肥。因为缺牲口和车，人单力薄，他说：“这当儿，心里觉着还是没有底，腰板不硬。”
    毛主席给全国农民指出了摆脱贫困、走向富裕的互助合作的道路，这正好能治王洛香当时的“症候”。他和六户贫农搞起一个互助组，水帮鱼，鱼帮水，比单干强多了。但是，组里只有个把小牲口，生产上还是有困难。后来，他们这个组和马保山的组合起来，组成了一个十六户的初级社。大伙凑钱买了个大牲口，这是一件了不起的大喜事。王洛香看到了组织起来力量大，对合作社充满了信心，只要有利于社的事，他就干。社里要搞副业，他带头把轧花车交到社里；为了解决搞副业的资金、原料问题，他又拿出两石麦子和棉花籽、农具。一个冬春，就挣回了两个大牲口，农业生产也提高了。水涨船高，生产发展了，收入增加。这两年，王洛香连修带盖添了六间新砖房。但是，王大伯说：“因为社小，总是增产不快，大家都觉得这么干不尽兴。”到后来，九个村子组织了一个高级社，力量更大了，社里打了机井，买了锅驼机，添了壮牲口，制了新农具，生产愈闹愈红火。去年一闹大跃进，大家感到要想全面发展生产，光靠生产单一的农业社还是不行，于是就办起了人民公社来。
    说到公社，王大伯特别兴奋。他说：“现在，有了公社，锅驼机也嫌落后了，我们已经用电力抽水浇地了。”
    原来，这个公社已经办起一个火力发电厂，一排排新竖的电线杆子伸向远方，一座座水泵房里传出了马达的声音，井台上不见牲口不见人，渠道里的水就哗哗地流向田间。公社还有了拖拉机站。土地经过了平整、划方和深翻，产量就来了个大跃进。王大伯的姑娘小缺，就是在这大跃进的形势下，跑出学校，到公社发电厂去工作的。仅仅一年多，这个十八岁的农村姑娘，就已经熟练地掌握了操纵、检修发电机、检修线路等技术。
    种地、灌溉，由人力、畜力到使用拖拉机和电力；平均每亩产量由1949年的二百斤、1951年的二百五十斤、1953年的三百四十斤、1956年的三百九十一斤，直到去年的五百四十五斤。
    “说来说去，没有共产党，没有毛主席，也就没有今天的好日子。”王大伯攥着拳头说：“坚决跟着共产党和毛主席走，不会错。”他和其他农民一样，得到了这样一条最根本的结论。
          热爱集体人人向上
    王大伯的话，也说明了这一家人为什么干劲特别大，热爱集体的心思特别强。干起活来，王洛香是不吃不觉饿，不睡不觉困。对于公社的大小事情，许多社员说他格外好操心。今年麦收的一个午夜，一场暴雨袭来，他绕街呼唤社员们到麦场去护垛。盖麦垛没有席子，他赶忙跑回家去，把炕席揭了来。儿子江水从父亲那里学习了舍己为公的品德，无论工作、劳动，哪里有困难，就到那里去。最近因为大雨，村南孟良河告急，他不避危险地跳到急流里，坚持堵口工作，……。
    这个家庭的每个人，都想对社里的增产有所贡献。他们不光积极劳动，还积极学习，钻研农业科学技术。去年，就发生过这么一个有趣的故事：江水和几个小伙子搞了三亩甘薯高产试验田。他的媳妇俊琢知道了，也约了几个青年妇女搞了三亩试验田。不宣而战，暗地里比赛。女青年们看男青年们怎么作，她们就怎么作。结果，江水他们的试验田每亩产了两万多斤，俊琢她们的试验田每亩只收了一万七千多斤。她很纳闷，问过了江水，才知道他们是按照甘薯生长期的不同，加施氮、磷、钾等不同性质的肥料。而她们施的肥虽多，但是不合科学。江水告诉她：“要想高产，得学点科学知识。”现在，她也常常看些农业技术的小册子了。
