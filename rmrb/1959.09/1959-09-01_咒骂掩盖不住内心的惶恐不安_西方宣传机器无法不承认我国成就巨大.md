Xinhua News Agency, August 31st - Western reactionary propaganda organizations serving imperialism are continuing to curse and attack our country's Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production last year, the People's Commune movement, and the mass steel smelting campaign. However, this cannot conceal the fear and unease in their hearts regarding the great achievements our country has made in the Great Leap Forward.

Many Western reactionary propaganda organizations, especially American propaganda organizations, continue to use the verification of last year's agricultural output and the adjustment of this year's production plan targets to slanderously claim that our country's "prestige has been hit," that it is "facing a serious economic crisis," that "economic plans have failed," etc., and viciously attack our country's People's Commune system for "causing chaos and waste." They express schadenfreude towards the difficulties that this year's floods and droughts will bring to our country's agricultural production. They attempt to diminish the far-reaching impact of our country's Great Leap Forward through this kind of propaganda.

　　The "New York Herald Tribune" deliberately spread a theory that our country's verification of last year's agricultural output will "damage" people's impression of "how their (China's) system can rapidly elevate a hungry and backward country to the position of a first-class industrial power."

　　The United States Information Service also took the opportunity to distort propaganda, claiming that China "has, in effect, abandoned the 'Great Leap Forward'" and "abandoned the movement to make steel in small roadside blast furnaces," attempting to create a confusing impression of our country's policies.

　　However, some Western newspapers that hate our working people cannot help but admit that our country's Great Leap Forward is a great achievement, even while viciously cursing our country.

　　An article by Woodrow Wyatt published in Britain's "Reynold's News" on August 30th admitted: "Even from the reduced figures, China's economic achievements still exist and will continue to be impossible to ignore."

　　An article by Alex Jose from Singapore published in the same newspaper on the same day also admitted, "The adjusted (China's plan targets for this year) still mean considerable progress, for example, steel production has increased by 50% compared to last year. …It is important to look at these new figures from the right perspective. It is useless for us to deceive ourselves." The newspaper also pointed out that the targets of China's Second Five-Year Plan "will be largely achieved well ahead of schedule this year. This means that China still has a great hope of realizing the slogan of 'catching up with Britain in the output of (major) industrial products within fifteen years' in ten years."

　　British Labour Party MP Donelly published an article in the "Sunday Times" on the 30th, in which he slandered that the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC would cause a "blow" to our country's "prestige," but on the other hand, he had to admit that "overall, it must be emphasized that some of the more realistic indicators have indeed taken a big step forward from where they were originally; if China can produce twelve million tons of steel, that would be a major achievement."

　　An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Hong Kong on August 30th also admitted that "the actual record of the past two years makes it possible to complete the original figures of the Second Five-Year Plan announced in 1957 by the end of this year or early 1960, and this will be a huge achievement."

　　Paris' "Les Echos" pointed out on the 28th, "In any case, in all sectors, China's output this year will be greater than last year."

Xinhua News Agency, August 31st, Tokyo dispatch: After the publication of the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, while the Japanese bourgeoisie's propaganda machine had to admit the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist economic construction in the face of facts, on the other hand, it tried its best to carry out malicious distortion and slander on the matter of China's adjustment of the 1959 plan targets.

　　"Mainichi Broadcasting" said on the 28th, "In the ten years since the Communist Party seized power, Communist China has indeed made extraordinary developments. This is a fact that the whole world cannot but admit." It also had to admit that "completing the Five-Year Plan in two years cannot be said to be a failure." This radio station itself also said: "One has to admit" that the Chinese people "have done quite well."

　　However, it deliberately spread the slander that cast doubt on the Chinese people's great achievements, saying that from China's verification of last year's output, "it is felt that what China says cannot be believed." It also attempted to make people believe that a "crisis" could occur in a socialist country like China.

　　"Mainichi Shimbun" said on the 28th, "China's actual achievements last year, compared to the previous year, grain increased by 35%, cotton increased by 28%, and steel ingots increased by 49.5%. Therefore, if the increase production and practice economy movement launched this year has good results, it is possible to complete the main production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year."

　　This newspaper also admitted, "This situation shows that China's economy is indeed developing. We believe that there is reason here not to misjudge the future of the Chinese Communist Party."

　　However, this newspaper distorted the propaganda on China's adjustment of the 1959 plan targets, saying, "This decision by the CPC is a decisive retreat and a self-criticism of policy failures."

　　"Asahi Shimbun" said on the 27th, "China has achieved great achievements in industrial and agricultural production because it implemented the policy of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture last year and organized the People's Communes." However, it then distorted the propaganda on China's People's Commune movement, saying that it "caused economic chaos."

　　"Yomiuri Shimbun" admitted on the 28th that China's increased production achievements last year were indeed a Great Leap Forward.

### 咒骂掩盖不住内心的惶恐不安  西方宣传机器无法不承认我国成就巨大

    咒骂掩盖不住内心的惶恐不安
    西方宣传机器无法不承认我国成就巨大
    新华社31日讯　为帝国主义效劳的西方反动宣传机构正在继续咒骂和攻击我国去年工农业生产的大跃进、人民公社运动和全民炼钢运动。但是，这并掩盖不住他们内心深处对我国在大跃进中所取得的伟大成就的恐惧和不安。
    许多西方的反动宣传机构，特别是美国的宣传机构继续利用我国核实去年的农业产量和调整今年的生产计划指标大肆诬蔑我国“威信受到了打击”，正“面临着严重的经济危机”，“经济计划失败了”，等等，并且恶毒地攻击我国的人民公社制度“造成了混乱和浪费”。对今年我国所遭受的水旱灾害将给我国农业生产带来的困难表示幸灾乐祸。它们企图通过这种宣传来缩小我国的大跃进所产生的深远影响。
      “纽约先驱论坛报”故意散布一种论调，说我国核实去年的农业产量将使得人们对“他们的（中国的）制度怎样能使一个饥饿落后的国家迅速上升到头等工业国的地位”的印象“受到损害”。
    美国新闻处还乘机歪曲宣传中国“在实际上，放弃了‘大跃进’”，以及“放弃了在路边小高炉中炼钢的运动”，企图制造对我国政策的混乱印象。
    但是，一些仇视我国劳动人民的西方报刊甚至在恶毒地咒骂我国的时候也不能不承认我国的大跃进是一个巨大的成就。
    英国的“雷诺新闻”8月30日刊载的伍德罗·怀阿特的一篇文章承认：“即使从减少了的数字看，中国的经济成就仍然是存在的，而且将继续是不可忽视的”。
    这家报纸同一天刊载的亚历克斯·约瑟从新加坡发回的一篇文章也承认，“经过调整的（中国今年的计划指标）数字仍然意味着相当大的进步，例如，钢产量比去年增加50％。……必须注意从正确的角度来看待这些新的数字。我们自欺欺人是没有用处的。”这家报纸还指出，中国第二个五年计划的指标“大多数将在今年内大大提前达到。这就意味着中国仍然大有希望在十年内实现‘在十五年内在（主要）工业产品产量方面赶上英国’的口号”。
    英国工党议员唐纳利30日在“星期日泰晤士报”上发表的一篇文章中一方面诬蔑说中共八届八中全会的公报将使我国的“威信”遭到“打击”，另一方面也不得不承认“全面地看，必须强调指出，有一些比较现实的指标的确是从原来的地方向前迈进了一大步；如果中国能够生产一千二百万吨钢，那将是一个重大的成就。”
    法新社8月30日从香港发出的一条消息也承认，“过去两年的实际纪录使得（中国）有可能在今年年底或1960年年初完成在1957年宣布的第二个五年计划的原来的数字，而这一点将是巨大的成就。”
    巴黎“回声报”28日指出，“无论如何，在一切部门中，中国今年的产量将比去年大。”
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：在中共八届八中全会公报发表以后，日本资产阶级的宣传机器一方面在事实面前不得不承认中国社会主义经济建设的大跃进，另一方面却极力就中国调整1959年计划指标这件事进行恶意的歪曲宣传和诬蔑。
    “每日广播电台”28日说，“自从共产党掌握政权以来的十年间，共产党中国的确有了不寻常的发展。这是整个世界都不能不承认的事实”。它还不得不承认，“五年计划两年完成，这就不能说是失败了”。这家电台自己也说：“不得不承认”中国人民“干得相当好”。
    但是，它却又故意散布怀疑中国人民巨大成就的谰言说，从中国核实去年的产量来看，“令人感到中国所说的不能置信”。它还企图使人相信在中国这样的社会主义国家中竟会发生“危机”。
      “每日新闻”在28日说，“中国去年的实际成绩，同前年相比，粮食增加了35％，棉花增加了28％，钢块增加了49.5％。因此，今年展开的增产节约运动如果有良好成绩，在今年完成第二个五年计划的主要生产指标，这是可能的”。
    这家报纸还承认，“这种情况说明，中国的经济确实正在发展。我们认为，在这里有理由不能错看中国共产党的前途”。
    然而，这家报纸却就中国调整1959年计划指标进行歪曲宣传说，“中共这次决定是果断的后退，同时是对政策失败的自我批评”。
    “朝日新闻”27日说，“中国由于在去年执行了工农业大跃进的政策，组织了人民公社，因而在工农业生产方面取得了重大成就”。可是，它随即又歪曲宣传中国的人民公社运动“引起了经济混乱”。
    “读卖新闻”在28日承认，中国去年增产成绩的确是大跃进。
