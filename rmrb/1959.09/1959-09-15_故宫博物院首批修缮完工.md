    First Phase of Renovation of the Palace Museum Completed

    (Xinhua News Agency) The renovation project of the three main halls of the Palace Museum in the capital – the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Hall of Central Harmony, and the Hall of Preserving Harmony – as well as the Imperial Garden, has recently been completed.

    The Palace Museum covers an area of more than 720,000 square meters. Construction began in 1406, and after more than 500 years of continuous development during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the building area is approximately 150,000 square meters. It embodies the meticulous creations of many working people. However, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to years of neglect, many buildings collapsed. At the time of liberation, there were more than 250,000 cubic meters of garbage accumulated within the palace.

    After liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to the protection of national heritage and the restoration and maintenance of historical relics. A professional renovation team of several hundred people was established, and special funds were allocated for emergency repairs. To date, approximately 90,000 square meters have been renovated, accounting for 60% of the total building area.

    The main content of this recently completed batch of projects is the painting and decoration of the outer eaves of the halls. Dust removal, repair, and decoration work were also carried out on the paintings inside the halls. These projects were all relatively detailed, and the workers carefully ensured the quality of the projects during the renovation.

    故宫博物院首批修缮完工
    据新华社讯　首都故宫博物院的三大殿——太和殿、中和殿、保和殿，及御花园的修缮工程，在最近已全部完工。
    故宫纵横占地七十二万多平方米。从1406年开始，经过明清两代五百多年不断经营，建筑面积约十五万平方米。其中有许多劳动人民的精心创造。但是在国民党反动统治时期，因为常年失修，房屋倒塌很多，解放时宫内堆积的垃圾，就有二十五万多立方米。
    解放后党和政府对保护民族遗产和修复维护历史文物非常重视，成立了一支几百人的专业修缮队伍，拨出专款，抢救维修。到目前为止，已经维修的面积约九万平方米，占全部建筑面积的60％。
    最近完工的这批工程的主要内容是殿宇外檐的油饰彩画，对殿内的彩画也进行了除尘、修补装饰工作。这些工程都比较细致，工人们在修缮中精心地保证了工程质量。
