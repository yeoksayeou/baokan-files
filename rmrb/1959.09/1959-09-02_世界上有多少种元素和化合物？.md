Did you know?

    In the thirteenth century, mankind only knew of nine chemical elements existing in all things in nature. Now, one hundred and two elements are known. Scientists believe that all substances in nature are composed of these elements. Modern chemical industry can already produce about 20,000 kinds of chemical products. But how many kinds of chemical compounds can these elements form?
    Many scientists have answered this question in the past, but according to recent estimates of the number of compounds that various molecules can form, it far exceeds all previous calculations.
    Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, determined that this number should be 10<sup>1300</sup>. He said it is difficult to find a number that can be compared with this unimaginable number. It should be known that the number of atoms that make up the Earth is only about 10<sup>50</sup>. If we treat each atom of the Earth as another Earth, and then extrapolate according to the multiple of the number of atoms of the Earth, it would only be 10<sup>100</sup> in total. This is still far from 10<sup>1300</sup>.
    It can be seen that the compounds that the currently known one hundred and two elements can form are much larger than the number of atoms in the entire Earth.

    世界上有多少种元素和化合物？
    在十三世纪的时候，人类只知道在自然万物中存在九种化学元素，而现在已经知道的元素有一百零二种。科学家认为，自然界中的一切物质都是由这些元素构成的。当代化学工业已经能生产两万种左右的化学产品。但是，究竟这些元素能够组成多少种化学化合物呢？
    历史上有不少科学家曾对这一问题作过回答，然而根据不久前对各种分子所可能构成化合物的数量的估计，却远远超过以往的一切计算。
    苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫确定，这个数字应为101300。他说，很难找到一个数字能和这个难以想像的数字相比。要知道，组成地球的原子数量也仅有约1050个。假若我们把地球的每一个原子又当作是一个地球，然后再根据地球原子的数量的倍数来推算，总起来也不过是10100。距离101300还很远呢。
    可见，目前已知的一百零二种元素可能构成的化合物比整个地球的原子数目还要大得多。
