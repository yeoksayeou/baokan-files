The American propaganda machine continues its frantic attacks on China's socialist cause after the publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Not only has the U.S. government-sponsored United States Information Agency, Voice of America, and American news agencies and newspapers repeatedly published their own commentaries, maliciously slandering the Eighth Plenary Session, but they have also collected slanders against China from reactionary newspapers and radio stations around the world and spread them, continuing to harp on the same old tune of China's Great Leap Forward being a "miserable failure," "not only failing to leap forward, but falling flat on its face," and the People's Communes "not receiving the support of the people." The New York Herald Tribune took the opportunity to issue a torrent of anti-communist fallacies, saying that China's verification of last year's production has "undermined" the impression of "how China's socialist system can rapidly elevate a hungry and backward country into a first-class industrial power," and that "Marxism has no magic to bypass the harsh realities of economic life" to rapidly achieve industrialization. A recent issue of the American magazine "Newsweek" published an extremely vicious article entitled "Red China: ‘Sticks’." It said that "Beijing's mistake is due to excessive ambition." The practice of "Beijing organizing its people into a large machine" to engage in "back-breaking production movements" has not changed. It even maliciously slandered that the Chinese people "are so severely oppressed" that they have become like "sticks" that "do not react at all." The Daily News publicized that China's production has suffered "huge failures" and asked triumphantly: "Who is the 'paper tiger' now?"

    妄想抹杀我国的巨大成就
    美国宣传机器继续大放厥词
    本报讯　美国资产阶级宣传机器在中国共产党八届八中全会公报和决议发表后继续对中国的社会主义事业进行疯狂的攻击。美国政府主办的——“美国新闻处”、“美国之音”和美国的通讯社和报刊不仅一再自己发表评论，就八中全会进行恶毒的诬蔑，并且搜罗各国反动报纸电台对中国的诽谤加以传播，继续弹唱中国大跃进“惨败”、“不但没有跃进，反而脸朝下倒了下去”，人民公社“得不到人民的支持”一类滥调。“纽约先驱论坛报”乘机大发反共谬论，说什么中国核实去年产量使得人们对中国的社会主义“制度如何能把一个饥饿落后的国家迅速提高成为一个第一流工业国”的印象“受到损害”，并且说什么“马克思主义并没有什么妙术能够绕过经济生活的严酷事实”而迅速实现工业化。最近一期的美国“新闻周刊”登载了一篇题为“赤色中国：‘木棒’”的极端恶毒的文章。它说“北京的错误是由于野心过大”。“北京把它的人民大众组成一部大机器”从事“累断腰的生产运动”的作法没有改变。它甚至恶毒地诽谤说：中国人“被压迫的如此厉害”，以致成为“根本没有反应的”“木棒”一样。“每日新闻”宣传我国生产上遭到“巨大失败”，并得意洋洋地问道：“现在谁是‘纸老虎’呢？”
