The news from the Beijing Evening News states that the performances held by the literary and art circles to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country have successively met with audiences on the capital's stage and have been warmly welcomed. On the evening of the 21st, the famous performing artist Mei Lanfang performed a short play on the same evening with his children for the first time. Mei Lanfang performed "The Drunken Concubine," Mei Baojiu performed "The Goddess Scattering Flowers," and Mei Baoyue performed "Zhan Zi at the Yuan Gate."

Mei Lanfang's "The Drunken Concubine" has long been a household name. This play has heavy singing and acting requirements, and is full of singing and dancing, and has more difficult movements such as "lying fish" and "holding a cup in the mouth". "The Drunken Concubine" accounts for about 3/5 of Mei Lanfang's performances in a year. Mei Lanfang said that the reason why he continues to perform this demanding play is to prolong the life of stage art, so that his hands, eyes, body, techniques, and steps are always used freely.

On the 22nd, the Second Troupe of the Shanghai Yue Opera Theater performed "Dream of the Red Chamber" on the capital's stage, which was welcomed by the audience and was considered one of the more successful opera adaptations based on the original literary work. The entire play is divided into twelve scenes, from "Daiyu Enters the Mansion", "Recognizing the Golden Lock", "Reading the West Chamber", "Unworthy Deeds", "Flogging Baoyu", "Slap in the Face", "Burying Flowers, Testing Jade", "Sister Feng Offers Advice", "Silly Maid Reveals the Secret", "Daiyu Burns the Manuscripts", "The Golden and Jade Match", all the way to "Crying at the Funeral, Leaving Home." Xu Yulan, who plays Baoyu, and Wang Wenjuan, who plays Daiyu, both have long singing sections in the play. In addition to highlighting the two main characters, Bao and Dai, the play also provides quick sketches of several other characters, such as Baochai, Zijuan, Grandmother Jia, Sister Feng, Qingwen, and Xiren.

On the 23rd, the Beijing Film Actors Troupe's long-rehearsed Shakespearean play "Twelfth Night" will be officially staged. This play was rehearsed by the Beijing Film Actors Troupe during their busy film shooting schedule. (Attached photo)

    首都文艺演出受到欢迎
    京剧贵妃醉酒和越剧红楼梦先后上演
    据北京晚报消息　文艺界为庆祝建国十周年而举行的献礼演出已经陆续在首都舞台上同观众见面，受到热烈欢迎。21日晚上，著名表演艺术家梅兰芳，第一次同他的子女在一个晚会上，各自演出一出短剧。梅兰芳演“贵妃醉酒”，梅葆玖演“天女散花”，梅葆玥演“辕门斩子”。
    梅兰芳的“贵妃醉酒”，早已脍炙人口。这出戏唱做繁重，载歌载舞，并且有“卧鱼”“衔杯”等比较难演的身段。“贵妃醉酒”在梅兰芳一年的演出场次中约占3／5。梅兰芳说，他所以要持续不断地演出这出吃重的戏，是为了延长舞台艺术的生命，使自己的手、眼、身、法、步永远运用自如。
    22日，上海越剧院二团在首都舞台上演出“红楼梦”，受到观众欢迎，被认为是根据文学原著改编较成功的戏曲之一。全剧共分十二场，从“黛玉进府”、“识金锁”、“读西厢”、“不肖种种”、“笞宝玉”、“闭门羹”、“葬花、试玉”、“凤姐献策”、“傻丫头泄密”、“黛玉焚稿”、“金玉良缘”，一直到“哭灵、出走”。扮演宝玉的徐玉兰和黛玉的王文娟在戏中都有大段唱工。这个剧除了突出了宝、黛两个主要人物，对宝钗、紫鹃、贾母、凤姐、晴雯、袭人等几个人物也都作了速写式的勾画。
    23日，北京电影演员剧团早已排练的莎士比亚名剧“第十二夜”，就要正式上演了。这个剧，是北京电影演员剧团在紧张的影片拍摄工作中排练出来的。（附图片）
