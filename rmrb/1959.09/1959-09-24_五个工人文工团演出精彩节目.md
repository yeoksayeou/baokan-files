Five workers' cultural troupes in Beijing have begun their performance to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China yesterday. In thirteen evenings, they will present more than forty plays, songs, dances, and musical programs reflecting the life and struggles of the working class, adding a vigorous and fresh atmosphere to the capital's art scene on the eve of the National Day.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) Workers' Drama Troupe, ACFTU Workers' Song and Dance Troupe, China Railway Art Troupe, China Coal Mine Art Troupe, and China Construction Song and Dance Troupe are participating in this performance. Among the participating programs are "Flying Side by Side" by the ACFTU Drama Troupe and "February 7th Storm" by the China Railway Art Troupe.

The opera "Pearl Wall" by the China Construction Song and Dance Troupe is a true story. In 1930, Qiu Chunfa, a worker from Anyuan Coal Mine in Jiangxi, joined the Red Fourth Army led by Chairman Mao. Before the Red Army left Anyuan, Qiu Chunfa's wife specially asked the Red Army propagandist to write the slogan "Long Live the Anyuan Workers' Uprising" on the wall of her house. From then on, she fought a long-term battle with the enemy to protect this slogan.

The short dance drama "Robbing the Bride" by the ACFTU Song and Dance Troupe is a comedy that satirizes the landlord robbing a girl from the people to be his wife. However, when the bridal sedan chair was carried into the bridal chamber, it was a big bear that was worshiping him! In addition, there are "On the Train," "Harvesting Sweet Potatoes," "New Products"; the song "The First Day at Work," and the small chorus "Where Did Such an Old Peddler Come From," and other programs.

    五个工人文工团演出精彩节目
    本报讯　在北京的五个工人文工团从昨天起举行庆祝建国十周年献礼公演。他们将在十三个晚会上以四十多个反映工人阶级生活和斗争的话剧、歌舞和音乐节目，为国庆前夕的首都艺坛，增添许多刚健清新的气息。
    参加这次献礼演出的有全总工人话剧团，全总工人歌舞团，中国铁路文工团，中国煤矿文工团，中国建筑歌舞剧团。参加演出的有全总话剧团的“比翼齐飞”、中国铁路文工团的“二七风暴”。
    中国建筑歌舞剧团的歌剧“珍珠墙”，是一个真实的故事。一九三零年，江西安源煤矿工人丘春发参加了毛主席领导的红四军。丘春发的妻子在红军离开安源之前，特地要求红军宣传员在她家的墙上写了“安源工人暴动万岁”的标语，从此，她为了保卫这条标语和敌人作了长期的斗争。
    全总歌舞团的小舞剧“抢亲”是一部喜剧，讽刺地主老爷抢民女为妻，但是，当花轿抬进洞房后，和他拜堂的却是一只大狗熊！此外，还有“在列车上”“抢收白薯”“新产品”；演唱有“上班的第一天”，小合唱“哪里来了这么一个老货郎”等节目。
