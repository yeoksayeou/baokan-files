Xinhua News Agency, September 9th—Iraqi “National News” published a commentary on September 3rd regarding the Sino-Indian border incident, stating, "Some minor incidents have occurred on the border between People's China and India. We believe that as long as these two countries share many common principles, as long as they are committed to world peace and hold goodwill towards each other, these incidents are quite normal and will not disturb these two great Asian neighbors."

The commentary said, "Many people know that there are many imperialist-sponsored bad elements in India. These elements specialize in creating sharp rifts between two friendly countries in order to basely exploit this rift to spread suspicion and doubt among these two neighbors, leading to conflict or even war."

The commentary said, "These bad elements are funded by imperialism, and if the governments of both countries do not increase their vigilance, the imperialist conspiracies can succeed."

The commentary said, "We can say—and we firmly believe—that People's China will never have ambitions towards India. True socialists cannot have colonies or dream of domination and colonization."

On the same day, the Indonesian "Eastern Star" published an editorial on the Sino-Indian border incident, stating that fabricating news of Chinese troops "attacking and bombarding" the Indian border aims to deceive world opinion and divert people's attention from imperialist interference in other countries. However, they cannot cover up their lies.

The newspaper said that the so-called Indian-Chinese border incident is just a provocation incited by the running dogs of imperialism in order to create a crisis in India and division in Asia. This can be proven by a series of events, from the provocations in Tibet, the disputes in Laos, to the crisis in Kerala, all of which were incited by them.

The newspaper further said that due to imperialist instigation, the internal political crisis in India, following the Kerala incident, is manifested in the resignations of Menon and the Chiefs of Staff. If the rumored resignation of the Chiefs of Staff is indeed due to their opposition to Menon's defense policy and opposition to the Indian-Chinese peace policy, then it is not impossible that the provocations in Kerala and the Sino-Indian border region were incited by the three Chiefs of Staff. They attack Menon only to cover up their tricks.

The newspaper pointed out that it seems that only by continuing to adopt a policy of resolutely opposing imperialism and adhering to peaceful coexistence can the Indian government overcome its current crisis. Judging from the perspective of the interests of the imperialists, their aim in creating a crisis in the Nehru-Menon government is only to provide the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization elements and the imperialist running dogs in India with the opportunity to take power.

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th—The Indian "Unity" published an editorial on September 4th regarding the Indian-Chinese border issue, stating, "On the one hand, we say that we hope to resolve the (Indian-Chinese) border dispute through friendly negotiations, but on the other hand, we are creating an atmosphere that will end all friendship and make any negotiations impossible. It should be said without hesitation that if the latter approach is pursued, it will mean suicide. If we go down this path, it will put us in a miserable situation, and the responsibility will be borne by those political parties who are crazy for leadership and have forgotten national interests. Newspapers that take spreading lies and sensational news as their creed will also be responsible for this."

The newspaper emphasized, "If we want to peacefully resolve these issues, we must strengthen the friendship between India and China."

The newspaper believes that those anti-Chinese propagandists in India want to replace Nehru's policies by constantly carrying out vicious propaganda against China and creating the possibility of Janata Socialist Party leader Kripalani replacing Nehru.

Prior to this, on August 21st, "Unity" editor Ranbir published an editorial in the newspaper opposing the current anti-China propaganda in India, and he pointed out, "If this propaganda does not stop, the country will definitely be harmed."

The editorial said that the Indian People's League, the Janata Socialist Party, and other reactionary Indian newspapers have used the Dalai Lama's statement to carry out propaganda, while "at the same time these leaders and parties also picked on the Kerala issue, but as soon as this issue was over, they turned to fabricating new rumors, saying that China was massing large numbers of troops on the Indian border. They say that China is preparing to merge Ladakh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sikkim and northern Assam into a Himalayan Federation. All these rumors have no basis in truth."

The editorial said, "Regardless of whether the Chinese troops in Tibet are many or few, we have no right to raise any objections, because all of this is in Tibet, and Tibet is part of China."

The editorial said that the news that Chinese troops were massing in the Indian border area was issued by the British and American newspapers, and "Indian newspapers wrote highly poisonous articles based on these reports."

The editorial said that India's anti-China slanderers have used "the so-called Tibetan people's struggle for freedom" as a pretext to launch "vicious slanderous propaganda against China, making those who believe that Sino-Indian friendship is beneficial to both countries begin to shudder. The Tibetan dispute has no connection with India, but these unwise people have turned it into a dispute between India and China."

The editorial said, "This meaningless propaganda currently being carried out by our newspapers is of no benefit to our country."

The editorial believes that "the purpose of freedom of publication and speech is to promote the cause of happiness and progress of this country, not to lead it to destruction and ruin."

The Indian "Link" weekly recently published an article on the Sino-Indian border issue, pointing out that the recent deterioration of Indian-Chinese relations "is mainly due to the ill-intentioned motives of foreigners, and it is not the result of the actual development of these two countries."

The weekly said: "The past few weeks have proved that it is easy to create unease and damage this relationship, which is crucial to Asian solidarity, due to the patronage of ill-intentioned foreign elements."

### 亚洲一些国家的公正舆论评论中印边境事件  必须警惕帝国主义挑拨中印关系的阴谋  印度“团结报”主张加强中印友谊和平解决两国边界问题

    亚洲一些国家的公正舆论评论中印边境事件
    必须警惕帝国主义挑拨中印关系的阴谋
    印度“团结报”主张加强中印友谊和平解决两国边界问题
    新华社9日讯　伊拉克“国家报”3日就中印边境事件发表评论说，“在人民中国和印度的边境上发生了一些小事件。我们相信，只要这两个国家在许多总的原则方面是共同的，只要它们致力于世界和平并且彼此都怀着善意，这些事件是很平常的事情，不会扰乱这两个亚洲大邻国。”
    评论说，“很多人都知道，在印度有许多帝国主义豢养的坏分子。这些分子专门在两个友好国家之间制造尖锐的裂痕，以便卑鄙地利用这个裂痕在这两个邻国中散布猜忌和怀疑，使之发生冲突甚而至于战争。”
    评论说，“这些坏分子素为帝国主义所豢养，如果两国政府都不提高警惕，帝国主义的阴谋诡计就能得逞。”
    评论说，“我们能够说——并且我们深信——人民中国永远不会对印度有野心。真正的社会主义者不可能有殖民地或梦想着统治和殖民地化。”
    同一天，印度尼西亚“东星报”在就中印边境事件发表社论说，捏造所谓中国军队“进攻与轰击”印度边界的消息，目的在于欺骗世界舆论，转移人民对帝国主义干涉其他国家的行为的注意。然而他们不能掩盖他们的谎言。
    报纸说，所谓印度中国边境事件只是帝国主义的走卒为了造成印度的危机和亚洲的分裂而煽动的挑衅而已。这从一系列的事件可以得到证明，从在西藏的挑衅、老挝的争执到喀拉拉邦的危机，所有这些都是他们煽动起来的。
    报纸又说，由于帝国主义的挑拨，印度内部的政治危机继喀拉拉邦事件后表现在梅农和三军参谋长的辞职方面。如果所传三军参谋长的辞职真的是由于他们反对梅农的国防政策和反对印度—中国和平政策，那么在喀拉拉邦和在印中边境地区的挑衅是由三个参谋长煽动，就不是不可能的了。他们攻击梅农只是为了掩盖他们的诡计。
    报纸指出，看来只有继续采取坚决反对帝国主义和坚持和平共处的政策，印度政府才能克服它目前的危机。从帝国主义者的利益的观点来判断，他们在尼赫鲁—梅农政府中制造危机的目的只是在于给东南亚条约组织分子和在印度的帝国主义走卒提供执政的机会。
    新华社9日讯　印度“团结报”4日就印中边界问题发表社论说，“我们一方面说，我们希望通过友好的谈判来解决（印中）边界纠纷问题，但是另一方面，我们又制造了一种将会结束一切友谊和使任何谈判都不可能进行的气氛。应当毫不犹豫地说，如果奉行了后一种办法的话，这将意味着自杀。如果我们走上这条道路，这将使我们陷于悲惨的境地，而这个责任将要由那些由于一心想当领导而疯狂和忘记了国家利益的政治党派来担当。那些把宣传谎话和耸人听闻的消息作为信条的报纸也将对这负责。”
    这家报纸强调指出，“如果我们希望和平解决这些问题的话，我们就必须加强印度和中国的友谊。”
    这家报纸认为，印度那些反中国的宣传者想通过不断对中国进行恶毒的宣传和造成由人民社会党首领克里帕拉尼代替尼赫鲁的可能性来取代尼赫鲁的政策。
    在这以前，“团结报”编辑兰比尔8月21日曾在这家报纸上发表社论，反对现在印度国内的反华宣传，他并且指出，“如果这种宣传不停止，这个国家肯定会受到损害。”
    社论说，印度人民同盟、人民社会党和印度其他反动报纸曾经利用达赖喇嘛的声明进行宣传，而“同时这些领袖和政党又挑中了喀拉拉邦问题，可是这个问题刚刚完，他们又转而捏造新的谣言，说中国在印度边界上集结大批部队。他们说中国正在准备把拉达克、不丹、尼泊尔、锡金和阿萨姆北部合并成为一个喜马拉雅联邦。这一切谣言没有丝毫真实之处。”
    社论说，“不管中国在西藏的军队是多还是少，我们没有权利提出任何反对意见，因为所有这一切都是在西藏，而西藏是中国的一部分。”
    社论说，中国军队在印度边界一带集结的消息是英美报纸方面发出来的，“印度报纸根据这些消息大写充满毒素的文章。”
    社论说，印度的反华诽谤家们曾经借“所谓西藏人的自由斗争”为名，展开了“恶毒的诽谤中国的宣传，使得那些相信中印友谊对两国都有利的人开始不寒而栗。西藏的争端同印度毫无联系，可是这些不聪明的人却把它变成了印度和中国之间的争端。”
    社论说，“我国报纸目前所进行的这种毫无意义的宣传对我们国家是没有好处的”。
    社论认为，“出版和言论自由的目的是要促进这个国家的幸福和进步的事业，而不是要使它陷于毁灭和灭亡。”
    印度“联系”周刊最近发表一篇关于印中边界问题的文章指出，最近印中关系的恶化“主要是由于外国人的不怀好意的居心所造成的，它并不是这两个有关国家实际发展的结果。”
    这家周刊说：“最近几个星期证明：由于不怀好意的外国分子的赞助，要制造不安和损害这种对亚洲团结至关紧要的关系是很容易的。”
