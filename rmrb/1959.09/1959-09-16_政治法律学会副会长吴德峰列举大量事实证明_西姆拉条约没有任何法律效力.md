Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Wu Defeng, Vice President of the Chinese Political and Legal Society, today listed a large number of ironclad facts to the Xinhua News Agency, thoroughly exposing the illegal nature of the so-called McMahon Line from the perspective of international law, and expressed resolute opposition to the Indian government's unilateral claims on the Sino-Indian border issue.

Wu Defeng sternly pointed out that the Simla Conference, as an important step in Britain's conspiracy to separate Tibet from China, discussed China's internal affairs at the time, and the conference itself was illegal.

Wu Defeng said that a border treaty is an agreement between two countries, and it must be unanimously agreed upon by the contracting countries. The text of the treaty must be formally signed by the plenipotentiary representatives of each contracting country. Treaties concerning territorial boundaries must be formally ratified by the central government of the signatory country and formally exchanged before they can take effect. This is a recognized norm of international law.

However, the so-called McMahon Line was neither discussed at the Simla Conference nor drawn up at this conference. The Simla Conference mainly discussed the boundary between the Tibetan region and other regions of China, as well as the boundary between so-called Inner Tibet and Outer Tibet. The appendix to the Simla Treaty only uses red and blue lines to draw these two boundaries. The Simla Conference did not discuss or demarcate the boundary line between China and India, which can also be proved from the fact that the appendix to the Simla Treaty does not mark the western boundary between China and India with a red line.

Wu Defeng said that, more importantly, the representative of the Chinese government did not formally sign the Simla Treaty, and this boundary line on the treaty itself and the appendix to the treaty was never recognized by any central government of China.

Wu Defeng cited a large number of materials to point out that the British side at that time did try to force the representative of the Chinese government to formally sign the treaty by various means, but the conspiracy never succeeded. After the British and Tibetan local authorities representatives signed the Simla Treaty on July 3, 1914, the British representative said to the representative of the Chinese government: "If there is still room for consideration, another meeting can be held on the 6th, and it can still be signed." On July 6th, the representative of the Chinese government resolutely refused to sign. At this time, the British representative decided to leave Simla and return home on July 10th. On July 10th, the then British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey stated to the British House of Commons that he still hoped that China could sign the treaty. This is because he also knew that if the Chinese central government did not sign, the treaty would not take effect.

Wu Defeng said that it should be further pointed out that the so-called Simla Treaty is still just a draft treaty that has not been formally signed by any party and has not been formally approved by any party, and has no legal effect at all.

He analyzed that Tibet is a part of China, and its representative at that time could only participate in the meeting as a representative of the relevant local government, along with the representative of the central government. Therefore, he could never sign a valid treaty with Britain separately from the representative of the central government. Moreover, it is also worth noting that the final signature of the representatives of the British and Tibetan local authorities on the treaty was still a tentative signature, not a formal signature. McMahon only signed the abbreviation of his name on the original treaty, and although the representative of the Tibetan local authorities signed his full name, Acheson, the Undersecretary of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, added a special annotation to this in his "Collection of Treaties Related to India and its Neighbors" compiled in 1929, explaining that this was because Tibetan could not be abbreviated.

Wu Defeng then sternly refuted Nehru's so-called "formal exchange of letters" that "affirmed" the McMahon Line. He said that the secret exchange of letters between the British and Tibetan local authorities representatives behind the back of the Chinese central government was of course of no value. Tibet is a part of China, and even the British representative at the time did not dare to deny this unshakeable fact. The first item of the exchange of letters attached to the Simla Treaty draft stated: "The contracting countries recognize Tibet as a part of Chinese territory." In this case, the secret exchange of letters between the representative of the Tibetan local authorities and the British representative can never constitute an agreement between China and Britain, and at most can only be said to be letters exchanged between the representative of a local authority of one country and the representative of another country.

Regarding the British-Tibetan secret exchange of letters itself, Wu Defeng said that it also did not conform to the international practice of boundary demarcation treaties. The British representative's letter only vaguely mentioned that the boundary line shown on the map was the Sino-Indian border from the Isorah Pass to Bhutan, but did not clearly state which specific locations this boundary line passed through. As for the letter from the representative of the Tibetan local authorities, it did not even specify the starting and ending points of this boundary line. According to custom, boundary demarcation treaties must clearly stipulate in the text where the boundary starts, through which specific locations, and where it arrives, and then mark this boundary line on the attached map, and state that the text is the basis, and will never only vaguely stipulate a starting point and an ending point in the text.

Wu Defeng pointed out that this is the reason why Britain dared not publish this exchange of letters or change the traditional drawing of this section of the border for a considerable period of time after the illegal exchange of letters. He said that until 1940, that is, twenty-six years after the exchange of letters, the sixth edition of the Oxford Advanced Atlas published by Oxford University in Britain had not changed the traditional drawing method, and therefore was consistent with Chinese maps and maps published by various countries in the past. Only after that did maps published by Britain and India unilaterally make illegal modifications to the drawing method of this section of the border in accordance with the so-called McMahon Line.

Wu Defeng also used many facts to show that the Tibetan local authorities were actually dissatisfied with this so-called McMahon Line. Lunxing Xhatola, the representative of the Tibetan local authorities who conducted the exchange of letters with the British representative at the time, also admitted in his "Compilation of Simla Conference Situation and Materials" that this exchange of letters was for Tibet "under special circumstances," swallowing "poison" as "good medicine." It was precisely because the Tibetan local authorities were deceived by Britain to draw this illegal boundary line that the Tibetan local authorities repeatedly discussed with the Indian government the issue of returning territory after the exchange of letters. After India became a dominion of the British Commonwealth in 1947, the Tibetan local authorities sent a telegram to Prime Minister Nehru on October 16 of that year, requesting India to return all the territory of the Chinese Tibetan region south of the so-called McMahon Line. At that time, Richardson, the responsible official of the Indian "Mission" in Lhasa, said in a memorandum in response to the Tibetan local authorities on December 12 of the same year: "India is very happy to receive a guarantee that the Tibetan government is willing to maintain bilateral relations on the existing basis until a new agreement acceptable to both parties is reached." It can be seen that the Indian government did not dare to "insist" on this illegal boundary line at that time.

At the same time, the British government also knew that the Simla Treaty and the British-Tibetan exchange of letters were illegal. The British government's "State Documents," which were specifically used to publish official documents, had not published these two documents until India's independence, which is enough to show that the British government did not consider the above-mentioned treaty and exchange of letters to be formal documents. Henry Twynam, a Briton who was once the Governor of Assam twenty years ago, also said on September 2 that the so-called McMahon Line "does not exist and has never existed."

Wu Defeng said that this area has not belonged to India for a long time, and no Indians had lived there until 1944. On the contrary, the people living there paid taxes to the Chinese Tibetan local government until 1951. Moreover, when Britain unilaterally drew the so-called McMahon Line, Britain had not conducted a survey of this area. It was not until the Second World War, when the Japanese army invaded Burma, that the British and Indian governments decided to organize an investigation of this area. A man named Von Haimendorf, who participated in this investigation, said in his book "Backward Conditions in the Himalayas" published in 1955: At that time, it was found that the boundary between 93 degrees east longitude and 97 degrees east longitude (i.e., the McMahon Line area) had not been demarcated, and those areas had not been surveyed. No one in India had ever been to the main vein of the Himalayas, but Tibetans often crossed some mountain passes to the forests south of the mountains. The area is inhabited by some uncivilized tribes called "Dephilas" and "Miris."

When refuting the Indian expansionists' slander that our country "invaded" India, Wu Defeng angrily said that it was in 1951 when the Chinese People's Liberation Army marched into Tibet that India invaded our country's territory. This time, they took advantage of the Tibetan rebellion to try to fish in troubled waters and invaded some places in our country. On the contrary, in the western section of the Sino-Indian border, China has always strictly abided by the traditional customary line, and in the eastern section, the Chinese army has never crossed the so-called McMahon Line.

Wu Defeng also indignantly rebuked Nehru's statement that India "inherited the situation during the British rule." Wu Defeng sternly pointed out that the object of inheritance must be legal. The so-called McMahon Line was originally illegal, and something that had never been recognized by the other government cannot be the object of inheritance at all.

Wu Defeng emphasized that all irrefutable facts are sufficient to fully illustrate that India's current attempt to impose the so-called McMahon Line on China has no legal basis and is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people.

    政治法律学会副会长吴德峰列举大量事实证明
    西姆拉条约没有任何法律效力
    新华社15日讯　中国政治法律学会副会长吴德峰今天对新华社记者列举大量铁的事实，从国际法上彻底戳穿所谓麦克马洪线的非法性质，并且表示坚决反对印度政府在中印边界问题上的片面主张。
    吴德峰严正指出，作为英国阴谋把西藏从中国分裂出去的重要步骤的西姆拉会议，当时讨论的是中国内政问题，这个会议本身就是非法的。
    吴德峰说，边界条约既是两个国家之间的协议，它就必须经过缔约国的一致同意。在条约的文本上，必须由各缔约国的全权代表正式签字。有关领土边界的条约更要经过签字国的中央政府正式批准，正式换文，才能生效。这是公认的国际法规范。
    可是，所谓麦克马洪线既没有在西姆拉会议上讨论过，也不是在这一会议上划出的。西姆拉会议讨论的主要是西藏地方同中国其他地区之间的界线，以及所谓内藏和外藏之间的界线。西姆拉条约的附图，也仅是分别用红线和蓝线画出这两条界线。西姆拉会议并没有讨论和划定中国和印度之间的边界线，这从西姆拉条约的附图上没有用红线标出中印两国西部边界也可以得到证明。
    吴德峰说，更重要的是，中国政府代表并没有在西姆拉条约上正式签字，而条约本身以及条约的附图上这条界线，也根本没有为中国任何中央政府所承认。
    吴德峰引证大量材料指出，英国方面当时确曾企图用各种办法来迫使中国政府代表在条约上正式签字，但是阴谋始终未能得逞。直到1914年7月3日英国和西藏地方当局代表在西姆拉条约上签字后，英国代表还对中国政府代表说：“如果还有考虑余地，可在6日再举行一次会议，还可以进行签署”，到7月6日，中国政府代表仍断然拒绝签字，这时英国代表才决定在7月10日离开西姆拉回国。就在7月10日，当时的英国外交大臣爱德华·格雷曾对英国众议院表示，他仍希望中国能在条约上签字。这是因为他也知道，如果中国中央政府不签字，条约就不能生效。
    吴德峰说，还应该进一步指出，所谓西姆拉条约，直到现在为止，仍然不过是一份没有经过任何一方正式签字的，也没有经过任何一方面正式批准的条约草案，根本没有任何法律效力。
    他分析说，西藏是中国的一部分，它的代表当时只能以有关地方政府代表的身份，随同中央政府代表参加会议，因此他决不能离开中央政府代表单独同英国签订有效的条约。而且还值得注意的是，英国和西藏地方当局的代表最后在条约上的签字仍然只是草签，而不是正式签字。麦克马洪在条约正本上只签了他的姓名的缩写字母，西藏地方当局代表虽然签了全名，但1929年印度外交部次长艾奇逊在他所编的“有关印度及其邻国的条约集”中对此还特别加了注解，说明这是由于藏文不能缩写的缘故。
    吴德峰接着严厉驳斥了尼赫鲁所说的把麦克马洪线“肯定”下来的所谓“正式换文”。他说，英国和西藏地方当局代表背着中国中央政府进行的秘密换文当然没有丝毫价值。西藏是中国的一部分，就连当时的英国代表也不敢否认这一不可动摇的事实。西姆拉条约草案本文后面所附的换文第一项就写明：“缔约国承认西藏为中国领土的一部分。”既然如此，西藏地方当局的代表同英国代表秘密进行的换文就决不能构成中英之间的协议，充其量只能说是一个国家的地方当局代表和另一个国家代表所交换的信件。
    关于英藏秘密换文的本身，吴德峰说，它也是不符合国际上划界条约的惯例的。英国代表的信件只是笼统地提到地图中所示的界线是从伊索拉希山口到不丹为止的印中边界，但并没有明确写出这条界线经过那些具体地点。至于西藏地方当局代表的信件，更连这条界线的起迄地点都没有说明。而按照惯例，划界条约都要在条文上明确规定边界从何地开始，经过那些具体地点，到达什么地方，然后再在附图上标出这条界线，并说明以条文为据，而决不会在条文中笼统地只规定一个起点和终点。
    吴德峰指出，这就是在非法的换文以后一个相当长的时期内，英国既不敢公布这项换文，也不敢改变地图上这段边界历来的划法的原因所在。他说，一直到1940年，也就是换文以后二十六年，英国牛津大学所出版的第六版牛津增订图集上还没有改变传统划法，因之也就同中国地图以及世界各国过去所出版的地图相一致。只是在那以后，英国和印度出版的地图才片面地把这段边界的画法按照所谓麦克马洪线作了非法的修改。
    吴德峰还用许多事实说明，西藏地方当局实际上一直对于这条所谓麦克马洪线也是不满意的。当时同英国代表进行换文的西藏地方当局代表伦兴·夏托拉，在他所编的“西姆拉会议情况及材料汇编”中也承认，这个换文对西藏来说是“在特殊情况下”，把“鸩毒”当成“良药”吞下去的。正是由于西藏地方当局是在被英国欺骗的情况下划这条非法的界线，所以在换文以后，西藏地方当局曾屡次同印度政府商谈归还领土的问题。1947年印度成为英联邦的自治领以后，西藏地方当局又在当年10月16日发了一份电报给尼赫鲁总理，要求印度归还所谓麦克马洪线以南的中国西藏地方的全部领土。而当时印度驻拉萨的“使团”负责官员李查逊在同年12月12日答复西藏地方当局的备忘录中曾说：“印度很高兴能得到一个保证，即西藏政府愿在既存基础上维持双方关系直到双方都愿接受的新的协定达成为止。”由此可见，当时印度政府并没有敢于“坚持”这条非法界线。
    同时，英国政府也自知西姆拉条约和英藏换文是非法的，英国政府所出版的专门用来公布官方文书的“国家文件”一直到印度独立时还没有公布过这两个文件，也足以说明英国政府并不认为上述条约和换文是正式文件。二十年前当过阿萨姆邦长官的英国人亨利·特怀南在9月2日也说所谓麦克马洪线“并不存在而且从来就没有存在过。”
    吴德峰说，这一地区长期以来从不属于印度，直到1944年也没有印度人在那里住过，相反，那里居住的人民，到1951年还曾向中国的西藏地方政府纳税。而且在英国片面地划出了所谓麦克马洪线时，英国并没有对这一地区进行过勘察。直到第二次世界大战期间，当日本军队侵入缅甸的时候，英国和印度政府才决定组织对这一地区的考察，曾参加这次考察的一位名叫冯·海门道夫的在他1955年出版的“喜马拉雅的落后情况”一书中说：当时发现在东经九十三度和九十七度之间的边界（按即麦克马洪线地区）并没有划定，那些地区也没有经过测量。印度境内向来没有人到过喜马拉雅山的主脉，可是西藏人却时常越过一些山隘到山南面的森林来。当地居住着一些称为“德非拉斯”和“米里斯”的未开化的部落。
    在驳斥印度扩张主义分子诬蔑我国“侵略”印度时，吴德峰愤怒地说，正是1951年当中国人民解放军向西藏进军时印度侵入了我国领土，这次他们趁西藏叛乱时又企图混水摸鱼，侵入了我国的若干地方。相反的，在中印边界的西段中国一直严格遵守传统的习惯线，在东段中国军队也从来没有超过所谓麦克马洪线。
    吴德峰还愤慨地斥责了尼赫鲁所说的印度“继承了在英国统治时代的情况”。吴德峰严正指出，继承的目标物必须是合法的。所谓麦克马洪线本来就是非法的，而且从未得到对方政府承认的东西，根本不能成为继承的对象。
    吴德峰强调说，一切无可置辩的事实，都足以充分说明印度方面目前企图把所谓麦克马洪线强加于中国，是没有任何法律根据的，是中国人民绝对不能接受的。
