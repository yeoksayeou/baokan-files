    Guangdong Uses Indigenous Iron and Steel to Make Large Quantities of Farm Tools

    (Our dispatch from Guangzhou, September 5th) The indigenous steel and iron produced by the tens of thousands of people in Guangdong Province who "went to the mountains to seek treasure" last year has played a significant role in this year's agricultural production. As of the end of August, incomplete statistics from twenty-six counties show that 7,278 tons of indigenous steel and iron have been used to manufacture 330 types of agricultural tools and hardware, totaling 5,450,800 pieces. Among them, Xingning and Gaozhou counties have not only met their own needs with the farm tools and implements produced from indigenous iron and steel but have also supported other counties with more than 245,000 pieces of hoes, pickaxes, and pliers.

    In order to use more and better indigenous steel and iron to manufacture farm tools and hardware to support a bumper late-season harvest, many regions have held on-site meetings and organized technicians to visit sites, engage in practical operations, and learn techniques since the beginning of this year. According to statistics from twenty counties, there are now 2,963 factories (groups) utilizing indigenous steel and iron, with 23,937 technicians. The variety of products has also increased from the original 92 to 330.

    In the process of using indigenous steel and iron to manufacture farm tools and hardware, various regions have vigorously carried out technical innovations to increase output and quality and reduce costs. For example, the Nibei Commune Farm Machinery Factory in Xingning County uses indigenous iron to cast plowshares, employing a continuous mold, which can produce twenty plowshares in one pouring of molten iron. The quality is also good, and the price is 24% lower than before. The Huaixiang Commune Farm Machinery Factory in Gaozhou County has changed from manual forging to forging with a belt hammer, greatly reducing labor intensity and increasing efficiency tenfold, reducing the cost of each hoe by 13%. This factory also mobilized workers to use indigenous steel to smelt better tool steel, solving the difficulty of insufficient tool steel. At the same time, it also used indigenous steel to manufacture milling cutters, lathe tools, wrenches, and other tool equipment to equip itself.

    In order to complete the province's production task of utilizing 10,000 to 12,000 tons of indigenous steel and iron in the second half of the year, the Provincial Department of Commerce plans to hold a second provincial evaluation at the end of the year to further utilize indigenous steel and iron more comprehensively.

    广东土铁土钢制成大批农具
    本报广州5日电　广东省去年成千上万人“上山取宝”所生产出来的土钢和土铁，在今年的农业生产中发挥了很大作用。截至8月底止，据二十六个县的不完全统计，已经利用土钢土铁七千二百七十八吨，制造出各种农具、五金三百三十种，共五百四十五万零八百多件；其中兴宁、高州二县，利用土铁土钢生产的农具、工具，不仅满足了本县的需要，还支援外县锄头、十字镐、老虎钳等二十四万五千多件。
    为了更多、更好地利用土钢土铁制造农具、五金支援晚造农业大丰收，今年以来，很多地区都召开了现场会议，组织技工到现场参观，实际操作，学习技术。据二十个县的统计，现在利用土钢土铁的工厂（小组），已经有二千九百六十三个，技工二万三千九百三十七人，生产的品种也由原来的九十二种发展到三百三十种。
    各地在利用土钢土铁制造农具、五金过程中，大闹技术革新，提高产量、质量，降低成本。如兴宁县坭陂公社农械厂利用土铁铸造犁头，采用连环模，一次倒铁水能生产二十个犁头，质量也好，价格比原来降低24％。高州县怀乡公社农械厂将人力锻打改用皮带锤锻打，大大地减轻劳动强度，提高工效十倍，每张锄头降低成本13％，这个厂还发动工人，利用土钢冶炼出较好的利器钢，解决了利器用钢不足的困难，同时还利用土钢制造出铣刀、车刀、扳手等工具设备，武装了自己。
    为了完成全省下半年利用土钢土铁一万吨至一万二千吨的生产任务，省商业厅准备在年底作第二次全省评比，进一步将土钢土铁更全面地利用起来。
