The staff and workers of the national coal mine capital construction units, opposing rightism and promoting enthusiasm, deeply carried out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, achieving significant victories in August. According to preliminary statistics, the total workload completed by the national coal mine capital construction departments in August reached over 150 million yuan, an increase of about 25% compared to July; among them, the amount completed in mid-August increased by 65% compared to the first ten days of August, and the amount completed in the last ten days of August increased by another 174% compared to mid-August. The workload completed by the coal mine capital construction departments in Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Xinjiang and other places increased by about 140% compared to July. The capital construction unit of the Henan Hebi Mining Bureau saw the workload completed in mid-August increase by 91% compared to the first ten days of August, equivalent to 2.2 times that of the same period in July; the tunneling speed of inclined shaft shafts, rock, base roadways, and coal bases also increased by 30% to 50% compared to July.

	The commissioning of new projects has greatly increased the production capacity of the coal industry sector. According to statistics from the Ministry of Coal Industry, the designed capacity of mines completed and put into production nationwide in August totaled 2.86 million tons, and the capacity of coal washing plants transferred for production totaled 4.2 million tons. By the end of August, the production capacity of coal mine shafts put into production nationwide this year totaled 8.99 million tons, 31% more than the same period last year; the capacity of coal washing plants put into production totaled 5.1 million tons, equivalent to 93% of the total capacity transferred for production last year. The speed of coal mine construction has further accelerated. In the first eight months of this year, the average construction period for small mines with an annual designed production capacity of 300,000 tons was 11.8 months, for medium-sized mines of 450,000 to 600,000 tons was 21.5 months, and for large mines of over 600,000 tons was 27.7 months, shortening the average construction period by about 25% to 40% compared to 1957 and 1958. The No. 7 mine in Pingdingshan, Henan, with a designed annual production capacity of 900,000 tons, which was put into production in August, was more complex in engineering than the No. 3 mine in Xieji Ji, Huainan, which was put into production during the First Five-Year Plan period, but the construction period only took twenty months, 5.3 months shorter than the construction period of Xieji Ji No. 3 mine.

	At present, the broad masses of staff and workers in the coal mine capital construction units are gathering even greater enthusiasm, determined to greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with practical actions to complete the September plan ahead of schedule.

    煤炭工业部门八个月建起大批厂矿
    产煤能力新增近九百万吨
    新洗煤厂一年可洗五百一十万吨煤
    本报讯　全国煤矿基本建设单位的职工反右倾，鼓干劲，深入开展增产节约运动，8月份取得重大胜利。据初步统计，8月份全国煤矿基本建设部门完成的工作量共达一亿五千多万元，比7月份增加25％左右；其中8月中旬完成数比上旬增加65％，下旬完成数又比中旬增加174％。江苏、江西、新疆等地煤矿基本建设部门完成的工作量，比7月份提高140％左右。河南省鹤壁矿务局的基建单位，8月中旬完成的工作量比上旬增加91％，相当于7月同期的二点二倍；斜井井筒、岩石、基道和煤基的掘进速度，也比7月份提高30％到50％。
    新工程的投入生产，使煤炭工业部门的生产能力大大增加。据煤炭工业部统计，8月份全国煤矿建成投入生产的矿井设计能力共二百八十六万吨，移交生产的洗煤厂能力共四百二十万吨。到8月底止，今年全国投入生产的煤矿矿井生产能力共达八百九十九万吨，比去年同期多31％；投入生产的洗煤厂能力共五百一十万吨，相当于去年全年移交生产的总能力的93％。煤矿建设速度进一步加快。今年前八个月平均建井工期，年设计生产能力三十万吨的小型矿井为11.8个月，四十五到六十万吨的中型矿井为21.5个月，六十万吨以上的大型矿井为27.7个月，比1957年、1958年的平均建井工期缩短了25％到40％左右。8月份投入生产的设计年生产能力九十万吨的河南平顶山七号井，工程比第一个五年计划期间投入生产的淮南谢家集三号井复杂，但建井工期只用了二十个月，比谢家集三号井的工期还缩短5.3个月。
    目前，煤矿基本建设单位的广大职工正鼓起更大干劲，决心以提前完成9月份计划的实际行动，迎接建国十周年。
