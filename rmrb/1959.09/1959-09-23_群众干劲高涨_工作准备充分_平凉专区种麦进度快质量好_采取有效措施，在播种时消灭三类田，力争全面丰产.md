This newspaper reports: The winter wheat sowing in Pingliang Prefecture, a major wheat-producing area in Gansu, is about to come to a victorious end. The masses are highly motivated to produce, sowing and laboring day and night. As of the 15th, the region had sown more than 4.2 million mu, accounting for 80% of the original plan. The sowing quality is good, with fine plowing, level harrowing, thorough weed removal, sufficient fertilization, and uniform seed distribution.

The counties (cities) in Pingliang Prefecture attach great importance to wheat sowing, considering it a decisive link in striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year. Therefore, they started full preparations very early. At the start of the summer harvest, various localities seized the time to plow the land while harvesting. During the summer grain storage, they proposed giving equal importance to storage and plowing. As a result, more than 5 million mu of wheat fields were plowed once before sowing, and 3.05 million mu were plowed twice, accounting for 64% of the main crop wheat fields. It is expected that 85%-90% of the wheat fields can be plowed twice by sowing time. While plowing, all counties in the region fully prepared fertilizers, seeds, and sowing tools. According to statistics, 3.4 million mu of land in the region have been fertilized, with an average of 5,800 jin of fertilizer per mu for all wheat fields. The selected good seeds reached more than 99% of the required seed quantity, and more than 79,000 pieces of sowing tools were prepared.

Measures were taken throughout the region to contract production from the very beginning of sowing, along with the "five fixed" responsibility system of fixing land, people, work, quality, and time. This greatly enhanced the enthusiasm and responsibility of commune members for sowing. As of now, more than 2,500 teams have contracted production, accounting for more than 60% of the total number of teams, and some places are contracting while sowing. Through contracting, the broad masses of commune members discussed production targets, tapped yield-increasing potential, and greatly increased the sown area. According to statistics reported by various counties on September 7, the region plans to sow a total of 5.4 million mu of wheat this year, 200,000 mu more than last year, and strives to plant an additional 300,000 to 400,000 mu.

In order to ensure the quality of sowing, the masses in this prefecture have taken many effective measures to eliminate three types of fields during sowing. The region has about 600,000 to 800,000 mu of wheat fields planted after the same crop. According to past experience, most of the three types of fields are replanted fields. Therefore, this year, the localities generally plowed twice when planting wheat after the same crop, and also applied more fertilizer and applied it well, so that the wheat has a good developmental environment after sowing. During this period, cadres at all levels, in order to participate in production and lead production, focused on planting experimental fields, "satellite" fields, and high-yield fields. It is estimated that the above-mentioned experimental fields and high-yield fields in the region reach 1 million mu, accounting for about 20% of the wheat field area.

During the sowing period, thanks to the good anti-Rightist and enthusiasm-boosting education, the masses throughout the region have always maintained high production enthusiasm. While managing autumn fields well, they have generally launched a campaign to plant the three types of fields well, plant high-yield fields well, and ensure a large area of bumper harvest. Young people, the elderly, and women have all been involved in this hot sowing upsurge. Those with skills contributed their skills, and those with strength contributed their strength, and everyone was full of energy. Many production teams used the evenings for crash work during the busy summer planting season to ensure timely sowing. Between mountains and rivers, between the shady and sunny sides of mountains, because of different sowing periods, they promoted the communist spirit and carried out collaborative support, which greatly accelerated the sowing speed. According to statistics, there are currently more than 510,000 laborers involved in sowing in the region, accounting for 52% of the total labor force, and more than 280,000 head of livestock, accounting for 65% of the total draft animals. The momentum of wheat planting is extremely strong.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, reported: The people's communes in Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province, have been doing a fast and good job in wheat sowing this year. The county's wheat sown area has expanded from 72,000 mu last year to 90,000 mu, an increase of 25%. As of September 10, more than 64,300 mu had been sown, accounting for 71.5% of the planned sown area, and the sowing quality has also been greatly improved compared with last year.

Jingbian County is located on the Great Wall line, a semi-desert and semi-hilly area with a cold climate. It is the area in Shaanxi where wheat is harvested the latest and sown the earliest. Generally, it is harvested in the first half of July and sown in the first half of September, with only one and a half months in between. During this period, it is also the busiest season for autumn field management. In addition, because there is more land and less labor here, the plowing and preparation of wheat land in the past were very rough, less fertilizer was applied, and especially because it could not be sown in a timely manner, the yield was very low.

This year, all communes have adopted the method of harvesting, plowing, and accumulating fertilizer at the same time during the summer harvest to prepare for sowing. Before the start of wheat sowing, just as the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was being conveyed, the Party's fighting call greatly promoted the sowing work, and the county immediately launched a high tide of wheat sowing. In order to ensure strong seeds and seedlings, before sowing, in addition to using sieves and windmills to select the seeds that have been selected by ear and block, most of them are mixed with Sairei San, Azotobacter, plant ash, chicken manure, and grain husks, and are sun-dried and soaked in warm water.

    群众干劲高涨　工作准备充分
    平凉专区种麦进度快质量好
    采取有效措施，在播种时消灭三类田，力争全面丰产
    本报讯　甘肃主要麦产区平凉专区的冬小麦播种即将胜利结束，群众生产劲头很高，提耧下种，日夜操劳，截至15日，全区已播种四百二十多万亩，占原计划的80％。播种质量良好，耕得细、耱得平，草灭得净，肥施得足，籽下得匀。
    平凉专区各县（市）十分重视小麦播种，认为这是能否争取明年小麦大丰收的决定性一环，因此很早就开始了充分的准备工作。夏收开始，各地就抓紧时间，边收边翻地；夏粮入仓中，又提出入仓翻地并重。因此，五百多万亩麦田下种前全部翻耕过一遍，耕了二遍的共三百零五万亩，占正茬麦地的64％；预计到播种时，可以有85％—90％的麦地能翻到二遍。在翻地的同时，全区各县都充分准备了肥料、种子、播种工具。据统计，全区已有三百四十万亩地送上了肥，全部麦地每亩平均有肥五千八百斤；精选良种达到所需种子量的99％以上；播种工具准备了七万九千多件。
    在全区范围内采取了从下种就进行包产的措施，和定地、定人、定工、定质、定时的五定包干责任制，大大提高了社员的播种积极性和责任心。截至现在，已包好产量的队有二千五百多个，占总队数的60％以上，有些地方正在边种边包。通过包产，广大社员讨论了生产指标，挖掘了增产潜力，播种面积大大增加。根据9月7日各县汇报统计，今年全区计划播种小麦共五百四十万亩，比去年多种了二十万亩，还争取达到多种三十至四十万亩。
    为了保证播种质量，这个专区的群众在播种时即采取了许多有效措施来消灭三类田。全区约有六十万到八十万亩回茬麦地。根据历年经验，三类田大多是回茬地。因此，今年种回茬麦地的，各地一般都耕了二次，并且作到多施肥，施好肥，让麦子下种以后有良好的发育环境。在此期间，各级干部为了参加生产领导生产，大抓试验田、卫星田、丰产田的种植，估计全区上述试验田和丰产田达一百万亩，约占麦地面积的20％左右。
    在播种期间，由于很好地进行了反右倾、鼓干劲的教育，全区群众始终保持着高昂的生产热情，在管好秋田的同时，普遍开展了种好三类田、种好高产田，保证大面积丰产的运动，青年、老年和妇女都卷入了这个热火朝天的播种浪潮。有技术的拿技术，有力量的出力量，人人干劲十足。不少生产队在夏种紧张期间利用晚间进行突击，保证了适时下种。山川之间，阴山阳山之间，由于播种期不同，发扬了共产主义风格，开展了协作支援，也大大加快了播种速度。据统计，目前全区投入播种的劳力有五十一万多个，占总劳力的52％，畜力二十八万多头，占总役畜的65％，种麦声势极为浩大。
    据新华社西安电　陕西省靖边县各人民公社，今年小麦播种工作又快又好。全县小麦播种面积由去年的七万二千亩扩大到九万亩，增加25％。到9月10日止，已经播种了六万四千三百多亩，占计划播种面积的71.5％，播种质量也比去年大大提高。
    靖边县位于长城线上，是个半沙漠半丘陵地区，气候寒冷，是陕西小麦收割最迟，播种最早的地区，一般是7月上半月才收割，9月上半月就要播种，中间只相隔一个半月。在此期间，又是秋田管理最紧张的季节。加之这里地多劳力少，过去小麦翻地、整地都很粗糙，施肥又少，特别是因为不能适时播种，产量很低。
    今年，各公社都在夏收期间，就采取边收割、边翻地、边积肥的办法，进行播种准备工作。在小麦播种开始前，正值党的八届八中全会传达之际，党的战斗的号召，大大推动了播种工作，全县立即掀起了小麦播种高潮。为了保证籽健、苗壮，在播种前把已经过穗选、块选的种籽，除用筛子、风车进行精选外，绝大部分都用赛力散、固氮菌、草木灰、鸡粪、谷糠拌种和经过太阳晒、温水浸种。
