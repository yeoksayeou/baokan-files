Vigorously Develop the Benefits of Mountains, Rivers, Plants, and Trees
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    Fully developing and utilizing the various resources of mountainous areas and comprehensively developing mountainous production is the fundamental policy of our Party in building mountainous areas. Actively developing the production of mountain and forest by-products and vigorously developing the benefits of mountains, rivers, plants, and trees is an important measure to implement this policy and an important part of the diversified operations carried out by the people's communes in mountainous areas.

    China has vast mountainous and forest areas. In addition to producing timber, which is very much needed for national economic construction, these areas also grow a wide variety of extremely rich wild animals and plants. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 1,400 kinds of wild birds and animals in the country; two to three thousand kinds of wild fiber, starch, tannin, and other plants; and more than 400 kinds of wild oil plants. In addition, there are wild medicinal materials accounting for 80% of commonly used Chinese medicinal materials, and more than 70 kinds of wild non-staple foods such as shiitake mushrooms, wood ears, and dried bamboo shoots. These abundant resources provide a very good material foundation for us to develop the production of mountain and forest by-products. With the establishment of rural people's communes, it is possible to flexibly allocate labor on a larger scale and to operate a variety of production projects according to local conditions and in a timely manner, comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. This has created conditions that are far more favorable than in the past for the development of mountain and forest by-product production.

    Developing the production of mountain and forest by-products can provide a large amount of raw materials for light industry, enabling China's light industry to develop more rapidly. The rich wild fiber, starch, oil, tannin, and other plants in the mountains and forests provide a large source of raw materials for light industries such as textiles, paper making, oils, leather, brewing, and food. According to a preliminary survey of resources in only seven provinces, including Fujian, Henan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, and Liaoning, the reserves of wild fiber reach more than 10 million tons. Calculated at a 50% cotton yield rate, full utilization would be equivalent to the output of 50 million mu of cotton fields. Last year in Shaanxi Province, one-third of the oil used for soap in the entire province was solved by using wild oil plants. Some mountainous counties in Heilongjiang, Guizhou, and other provinces have mostly used wild starch to brew wine, achieving "no grain needed, fragrant wine everywhere." These facts all prove that there is great potential in using wild animal and plant resources in mountains and forests.

    Mountains and forests also produce a variety of special dried vegetables, dried fruits, and wild fruits. Developing the production of these products can further enrich the people's supply of non-staple foods and meet the diverse needs of the masses. With the development of national construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for industrial raw materials and means of livelihood will continue to increase in the future, and the prospects for utilizing wild resources will become greater and greater.

    Many kinds of mountain and forest by-products are important export commodities. In 1958 alone, more than 7.7 million wild furs were exported, exchanging for a large amount of construction materials for the country.

    Mountain and forest by-products are rich in reserves and high in economic value, and the produced goods are highly marketable. Therefore, actively developing the production of mountain and forest by-products is of great significance for promoting the prosperity of the mountain economy. The facts in many places have proven that grasping this link can greatly increase the income of communes and their members. For example, in Guizhou Province in 1958, the income from 21 major mountain and forest by-products reached more than 170 million yuan, with an average income of 25 yuan per labor force in the province. The 167,000 yuan in wages issued monthly by the five mountainous people's communes in Dongxing Various Nationalities Autonomous County in Guangdong Province mainly came from mountain and forest by-products.

    As mentioned above, actively developing the production of mountain and forest by-products is indeed a great thing that achieves multiple benefits, and it is also an important component of mountain construction. It is closely related to the entire national economy. Any idea that this is a small matter, unimportant, or that utilizing these wild things in the mountains and forests is too troublesome and may affect the main business should be corrected. Cadres at all levels, especially those working in mountainous areas, should establish the view of fully utilizing, actively developing, and utilizing mountain and forest by-products for a long time in their minds.

    In the past few years, we have achieved certain results in the utilization of mountain and forest by-products, especially after the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the production policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in people's communes. This work has made significant progress in many areas. However, on the whole, it is still far from meeting the needs of the country. At present, development is still uneven between regions, and the amount of utilization is still very small. According to statistics from several key provinces in 1958, the utilization rate of the three categories of wild fiber, oil, and starch resources was as low as 0.12%, and the highest was only 21.4%. This shows that a large number of useful things are still abandoned in the mountains and fields. In order to meet the diverse needs of the country, we must vigorously strengthen this work and ensure a bumper harvest of mountain and forest by-products this year.

    There are many types of mountain and forest by-products. When carrying out this work, all localities should, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, conduct comprehensive planning in accordance with local conditions, and according to the needs of the country, combined with the local resource situation, focus on key projects and major varieties, establish production bases for certain key products, and ensure the production of these projects. In terms of business scope, large-scale, concentrated production, highly technical, and labor-intensive projects should be operated centrally by communes, brigades, or state-owned forest farms; small-scale, scattered projects can be distributed to commune members as household sideline occupations. Labor should also be specifically arranged. For perennial production projects, professional production teams should be established; general products can be carried out during slack farming seasons or agricultural gaps, or in conjunction with timber harvesting, forest tending, and other tasks. In order to strengthen leadership over this work, all levels of management, organization of production departments, should establish full-time institutions and set up special personnel, put this work into practice.

    The production of mountain and forest by-products generally has a strong seasonality. August, September, and October are the key seasons for collecting wild oil, starch, fiber, wild medicinal materials, shiitake mushrooms, wood ears, and other products. Missing this season will cause reduced production or even production failure. For example, if many kinds of oilseeds and acorns are not collected in time, they will quickly rot or be eaten by wild animals after falling to the ground; if wood ears are not collected in time after they grow, they will dissolve. Forestry, commercial, and related departments and people's communes in mountainous areas in all localities should seize the current golden season for collection, and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, organize the masses to take immediate action, using agricultural work gaps to collect in a concentrated manner. For products with particularly strong seasonality, such as litsea cubeba, acorns, and sapium sebiferum seeds, forestry workers, their families, and nearby urban residents should also be fully mobilized to collect them in a concentrated manner. When collecting, forestry and commercial departments should strengthen technical guidance, pay attention to the protection and cultivation of resources, so that those varieties with high economic value and wide use are not used less and less, but more and more; methods that kill the chicken to get the eggs, exhaust the source, affect soil and water conservation in mountainous areas, or damage forests cannot be adopted. In individual areas, phenomena such as peeling trees for bark and seeds, cutting down trees to pick seeds, and pulling up roots have occurred in order to collect tree bark and seeds. When hunting, phenomena such as not distinguishing between males and females, seasons, or beneficial and harmful animals and birds, and shooting all together, have made many precious plants, wild medicinal materials, birds, and animals increasingly rare. This should be paid attention to. The masses should be educated to earnestly implement the policy of combining utilization, cultivation, and protection.

    The purchasing work is a key link between the collection and utilization of mountain and forest by-products. Experience has proven that waiting for farmers to deliver to their door will result in less collection, while not fearing high mountains and long roads and going deep into mountainous areas will result in more collection. Commercial departments should continue to implement the policy of collecting more, collecting quickly, collecting well, and collecting fully, both collecting the main and large quantities and collecting the secondary and small quantities. The purchase price should ensure that the masses have a reasonable income. In order to ensure good and full collection, production units and commercial departments should sign production and sales contracts or agreements, and implement production and purchase plans at all levels. Commercial and grain departments should appropriately take care of and solve the special needs of the masses in terms of production and living materials when they go deep into forest areas for production.

    Reasonably handling the distribution of production income is of great significance to the enthusiasm of the masses to engage in the production of mountain and forest by-products. It should be determined from the starting point of developing production, and adopting the principle of taking into account the three aspects of the state, the commune, and the individual. For the income from collective operations, a commission or excess reward method can be adopted. For the income from scattered, sporadic, and personal collection of products using spare time, or from small-scale products planted in front of and behind houses, the principle of whoever produces benefits should be implemented. In this way, both the enthusiasm of collective and individual production can be encouraged, and the lack of collection of sporadic resources can be avoided.

    The collection and utilization of mountain and forest by-products is not only an economic task, but also a mass work. As long as we exert our full efforts, under the leadership of the Party, firmly rely on the masses, and closely cooperate and collaborate with forestry, agriculture, light industry, grain, scientific research, and other departments, this work will surely be carried out victoriously.

    大兴山水草木之利
    本报评论员
    充分开发和利用山区的各项资源，全面发展山区生产，是我们党建设山区的根本方针。而积极发展山林副产品生产，大兴山水草木之利，正是贯彻这个方针的一项重要措施，也是山区人民公社开展多种经营的一项重要内容。
    我国山林地区广阔。这些地区除生产国家经济建设所十分需要的木材以外，还生长着各种各样极其丰富的野生动物和植物。据不完全统计，全国野生鸟兽就有一千四百多种；野生纤维、淀粉、栲胶等植物有两三千种，野生油料有四百多种。此外还有占常用中药材80％的野生药材和香菇、木耳、笋干等七十余种野生副食品。这些丰富的资源，为我们开展山林副产品生产提供了十分良好的物质基础。随着农村人民公社的建立，可以在更大范围内灵活的调配劳动力，也可以因时因地制宜地经营多种生产项目，全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔五业，这更为发展山林副产品生产创造了比过去任何时候都优越得多的条件。
    发展山林副产品生产，可以提供大量的轻工业原料，使我国的轻工业更迅速地发展起来。山林中丰富的野生纤维、淀粉、油料、栲胶等植物为纺织、造纸、油脂、皮革、酿造、食品等轻工业提供了大量的原料来源。仅据福建、河南、四川、陕西、甘肃、湖南、辽宁等七个省的资源初步调查，野生纤维的储量即达一千余万吨，以50％的出棉率计算，全部利用起来，相当于五千万亩棉田的产量。陕西省去年全省的肥皂用油就有三分之一是用野生油料解决的。黑龙江、贵州等省的一些山区县已大部利用野生淀粉酿酒，做到了“不用一粒粮，处处美酒香”。这些事实都证明了利用山林野生动植物资源大有可为。
    山林中还出产多种特产干菜和干果、野果，发展这些产品的生产，可以更加丰富人民的副食品供应，满足群众多方面的生活需要。随着国家建设事业的发展和人民生活水平的提高，今后对工业原料和生活资料的需求还将越来越大，利用野生资源的前途也会越来越大。
    山林副产品中，有很多种是重要的出口物资。1958年，仅野生毛皮一项就出口七百七十余万张，为国家换回了大量建设物资。
    山林副产品储量丰富，经济价值高，生产的商品性大，因此，积极发展山林副产品生产，对促进山区经济的繁荣有很大意义。很多地方的事实都证明，抓住了这一环，就能大大增加公社和社员的收入。如贵州省1958年二十一种主要山林副产品的收益就达一亿七千多万元，全省平均每个劳力收益达二十五元。广东省东兴各族自治县五个山区人民公社每月发放的十六万七千多元工资，主要来源于山林副产品。
    如上所述，积极发展山林副产品生产确是件一举多得的大好事，也是山区建设的一个重要组成部分，它与整个国民经济息息相关。任何认为这是小事，无关重要，或者嫌利用这些山林野生东西太麻烦，怕影响主业的思想都应纠正。各级干部，尤其是山区工作干部，应在思想上建立起充分利用、积极发展和长期利用山林副产品的观点。
    几年来，我们在山林副产品的利用方面取得了一定成绩，特别是在党的八届六中全会提出人民公社农林牧副渔全面发展的生产方针以后，这一工作在不少地区有了显著的进展。但总的来看，与国家需要还相差很远。目前，地区之间发展还不平衡，利用数量也还很少。据1958年几个重点省的统计，野生纤维、油料、淀粉三类资源利用率低的只有0.12％，最高的也只有21.4％。这说明大量有用之物还废弃于山野。为了适应国家多方面的需要，必须大力加强这一工作，保证今年山林副产品的大丰收。
    山林副产品种类繁多，各地在开展这一工作时，应在党委统一领导下，因地制宜进行全面规划，根据国家需要，结合本地的资源情况，突出的抓住重点项目和主要品种，建立某些重点产品的生产基地，保证这些项目的生产。在经营范围方面，大宗的、生产集中、技术性强、需要劳力多的，主要由公社、大队或国营林场集中经营；小宗的、零星分散的，可分散给社员作为家庭副业来经营。在劳力上，也应进行具体安排。常年生产的项目，应建立生产专业队；一般产品，可利用农闲或农事空隙进行，也可以结合木材采伐、森林抚育等工作进行。为加强对这项工作的领导，各级经营管理、组织生产的部门，应建立专职机构和设置专人，把这项工作切实的抓起来。
    山林副产品生产一般都有强烈的季节性，8、9、10月正是采集野生油料、淀粉、纤维、野生药材、香菇、木耳等产品的关键季节，错过这个季节，就会造成减产，甚至生产落空。例如许多种油籽和橡籽，如不及时采集，落地后就会很快腐烂或被野兽吃掉；木耳长成后不及时采集，就会化掉。各地林业、商业及有关部门和山区人民公社，应抓住当前采集的黄金季节，在党委统一领导下，组织群众立即行动起来，利用农忙空隙，突击采集。对山苍子、橡子、乌桕子等季节性特别强的产品，还应充分发动林区职工、家属和附近城市居民突击采集。采集时，林业、商业部门应加强技术指导，注意资源的保护和培育，使那些经济价值大、用途广的品种，资源不是越用越少，而是愈用愈多；不能采取杀鸡取卵、枯本竭源，影响山区水土保持或破坏林木的办法。个别地区为采集树皮、树籽，发生见树剥皮、砍树摘籽、连根拔掉的现象，在狩猎时，发生不分公母、季节、益害一齐打的现象，使许多珍贵的植物、野生药材和鸟兽日益减少，这是应该注意的。应当教育群众，认真执行利用、培育、保护三者并举的方针。
    收购工作是山林副产品从采集到利用中间的一个关键环节。经验证明，坐等农民送上门来就收得少，不怕山高路远、深入山区就收得多。商业部门应继续贯彻多收、快收、收好、收足的方针，既要把主要的、大宗的收购起来，也要把次要的、小宗的收购起来。收购价格应保证群众有合理的收入。为了保证收好收足，生产单位与商业部门应签订产销合同或协议，将生产、收购计划层层落实。对于群众深入林区生产，在生产和生活资料上的特殊需要，商业、粮食部门应适当照顾和解决。
    合理处理生产收益分配，对群众从事山林副产品生产的积极性有十分重大的意义。应当从发展生产出发，采取国家、公社、个人三方面兼顾的原则来确定。对集体经营的收益，可采取提成或超额奖励办法。对分散、零星、个人利用工余采集的，或屋前屋后种植的小宗产品的收益，应贯彻谁生产谁得益的原则。这样，既可鼓励集体和个人生产的积极性，又可避免零星资源无人采集。
    山林副产品的采集和利用，既是一项经济工作，也是一项群众工作，只要我们鼓足干劲，在党的领导下，坚决依靠群众，林业、农业、轻工业、粮食、科学研究等部门密切的配合与协作，这项工作必将胜利的开展。
