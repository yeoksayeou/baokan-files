The Enlarged Meeting of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee Calls on the People of the Province to Continue to Leap Forward on the Basis of High Speed

(By our newspaper dispatch) The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee held its twelfth enlarged plenary session from August 25 to September 15, conveying, studying, and implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The comrades attending the meeting fully supported the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session and, in light of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session, reviewed their own thinking and work, further boosting their enthusiasm. This meeting is of great significance for further implementing the Party's general line for building socialism and striving for greater victories in socialist construction.

The meeting considered the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to be a meeting of great historical significance and decided to resolutely implement it throughout the province. The meeting demanded that the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session be used to greatly improve the Marxist-Leninist level of all Party members in the province, further strengthen the unity and fighting capacity of Party organizations at all levels in the province, and launch a more vigorous mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy throughout the province.

The meeting used many inspiring facts to illustrate that the overall situation in Heilongjiang Province since the Great Leap Forward last year has been one of climax after climax and leap after leap. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party organizations and the people of the province resolutely implemented the Party's general line for building socialism, enabling the province's economic construction and various tasks to achieve unprecedentedly great victories since last year. According to verified figures, in 1958, the province's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 73.5% annually compared to 1957, of which industrial output value increased by 88.1% and agricultural output value increased by 45.6%. On the basis of production development, the purchasing power of urban people also greatly increased. Last year's Great Leap Forward enabled Heilongjiang Province, on the basis of many years of construction since liberation, to be formally built into one of the country's important industrial bases with heavy industry as its center and modern large-scale enterprises as its backbone; enabling the steel industry to develop from nothing to something, from less to more in a few months last year; enabling the province's coal output to increase by more than 8 million tons in one year, reaching an annual output level of more than 21 million tons, enabling the province's timber output to reach more than 10 million cubic meters, accounting for about one-third of the country's total timber output; enabling the province's grain output to reach more than 10 million tons; enabling Heilongjiang's industry, agriculture, and forestry to better shoulder the task of supporting the whole country; making the people's spiritual outlook undergo major changes, and making the backward face of the "Great Northern Wilderness" left over from history never to return.

In particular, on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, a vigorous situation of continued Great Leap Forward has emerged this year. From January to August, industrial output value increased by 64.2% compared to the same period last year, and there have been huge developments in the output of major products such as steel, coal, logs, machine tools, and power generation equipment.

The characteristics of Heilongjiang Province's Great Leap Forward this year are not only reflected in the huge development of heavy industry, but also in the leap forward development of light industry and the chemical industry. Under the call of the Provincial Party Committee to make up for "short legs," from January to August, the output value of the province's light industry and chemical industry increased by 86.4% compared to the same period last year; this Great Leap Forward is not only reflected in the increase in the output of various major products, but also in the significant improvement in quality, achieving greater and more comprehensive development that is faster, better, and more economical. In agriculture, except for some areas with varying degrees of disaster this year, crops are growing well in most areas, wheat production has increased by more than 30% compared to last year, and a bumper harvest of autumn crops is in sight. At the same time, science, culture, education, health, and political and legal work have all made great progress.

Due to last year's Great Leap Forward and this year's continued Great Leap Forward, the originally planned major targets that the state stipulated Heilongjiang Province should complete in the Second Five-Year Plan, such as coal and timber, have already been completed ahead of schedule last year. Major indicators such as steel, grain, power generation equipment, machine tools, electricity, cement, and machine-made paper can also be completed, overfulfilled, or approach completion this year.

The meeting used a series of the most powerful facts to refute the slander of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes by domestic and foreign enemies and a small handful of right-leaning opportunists. They clamored that the Great Leap Forward committed the mistake of "left-leaning adventurism," maliciously criticizing that the "shortcomings of the Great Leap Forward are not one finger, but several fingers or a big thumb." They have been completely bankrupt in the face of the ironclad great achievements of the Great Leap Forward.

The meeting deeply analyzed the situation and great historical significance of the realization of the people's commune system in Heilongjiang Province last year. It used powerful facts to illustrate that this change in production relations is the inevitable trend of the development of productive forces and the urgent requirement of the broad masses.

Facts have proven that as soon as the commune appeared, it showed unparalleled superiority and strong vitality, and played a great role in liberating productive forces. Last autumn, when the commune was just established, it carried out tense autumn harvesting, large-scale plowing, and centralized transportation of grain purchases at almost the same time. In Heilongjiang Province, with only 10 million rural people, more than 10 million tons of grain were harvested, more than 60 million mu of land were plowed in autumn, and the task of sending grain purchases was completed one and a half months earlier than the previous year. There were also 700,000 people participating in steelmaking and industrial construction. Such many and such large tasks would have been completely unimaginable if it were not for the commune system. In particular, after communization, agricultural mechanization has been further developed. More than one-third of the communes in the province have agricultural machinery to varying degrees. In addition, more than 4 million farmers in the province have participated in public canteens, greatly liberating productive forces and enabling greater development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and commune-run industries. The people's communes in the province have embarked on the road of solid and sound development after a series of rectification and consolidation work. Facts eloquently demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune. The meeting believed that the greatest superiority of communization is also reflected in the fact that it will forever eradicate the roots of capitalism, while the right-leaning opportunists are obsessed with the spread of capitalism. This is the best explanation of the essence of why they oppose communization.

The meeting emphatically pointed out that within the Party organizations of the entire province, it is necessary to conduct in-depth education on safeguarding Party unity, requiring all Party members in the province to consciously safeguard Party unity, improve the core leadership of Party organizations at all levels, and struggle against all phenomena that are detrimental to Party unity.

This meeting used the weapons of Marxism-Leninism to refute the views of a small handful of right-leaning opportunists, adhered to the general line of building socialism, and conducted in-depth criticism and education on a small number of cadres with right-leaning ideas and right-leaning emotions, further arming everyone ideologically and politically. This will be a great ideological driving force for continued Great Leap Forward in the future.

The meeting called on all Party members and the people of the province to unite under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, hold high the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, oppose right-leaning, boost enthusiasm, and further deepen the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, and bravely advance to achieve continued leap forward and strive for new and greater victories in the socialist cause.

### 黑龙江省委扩大会议号召全省人民  在高速度基础上继续向前飞跃

    黑龙江省委扩大会议号召全省人民
    在高速度基础上继续向前飞跃
    本报讯　中共黑龙江省委在8月25日到9月15日举行第十二次扩大全会，传达学习和贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的决议。与会同志完全拥护八届八中全会的精神，并以八中全会精神联系检查了自己的思想和工作，进一步鼓足了干劲。这次会议对进一步贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线，争取社会主义建设的更大胜利，有着非常重要的意义。
  会议认为八届八中全会是一次有伟大历史意义的会议，决定在全省坚决贯彻执行。会议要求以八届八中全会的精神，把全省党员的马克思列宁主义水平大大提高一步，使全省各级党组织的团结和战斗力得到进一步的加强，使全省增产节约的群众运动更加轰轰烈烈地展开。
  会议以许多振奋人心的事实，说明黑龙江省去年大跃进以来总的形势是高潮又高潮，跃进再跃进。全省党组织和全省人民在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，坚决贯彻执行了党的建设社会主义总路线，使全省去年以来的经济建设和各项工作都取得了空前巨大的胜利，根据核实后的数字，1958年较1957年全省工农业总产值达到了一年增长73.5％的高速度，其中工业产值增长88.1％，农业产值增长45.6％，在生产发展基础上，城市人民购买力也大为增加。去年的大跃进，使黑龙江省在解放后多年建设的基础上，正式建成为国家的以重工业为中心，以现代化大型企业为骨干的重要工业基地之一；使钢铁工业能够在去年几个月内从无到有，从少到多地得到了发展；使全省煤炭产量一年增长八百多万吨，达到年产两千一百多万吨的水平，使全省木材产量达到一千万立米以上，约占全国木材总产量的三分之一左右；使全省粮食产量达到一千万吨以上；使黑龙江的工业、农业、林业能够更好地担负着支援全国的任务。使人民的精神面貌发生重大的变化，使历史遗留下来的“北大荒”落后面貌从此一去不复返了。
    特别是在去年大跃进的基础上，今年又出现了蓬勃发展的继续大跃进的局面，在1至8月份工业产值比去年同期增长了64.2％，在钢铁、煤炭、原木、机床、发电设备等主要产品的产量上都有巨大的发展。
    黑龙江省今年大跃进的特点，不仅表现在重工业的巨大发展，而且还表现在轻工业、化学工业的飞跃发展。在省委提出的补长“短腿”的号召下，1月至8月份全省轻工业、化学工业的产值比去年同期增长了86.4％；这个大跃进不仅表现在各种主要产品产量的增加，而且表现质量的显著提高，做到了多快好省的更大更全面的发展。在农业方面，今年除部分地区有不同程度的灾害外，绝大部分地区作物生长良好，小麦产量比去年增长了30％以上，大秋作物丰收在望。同时，科学、文化教育、卫生和政法等各项工作都有很大的发展。
    由于去年的大跃进和今年的继续大跃进，原定的第二个五年计划国家规定黑龙江省要完成的部分主要指标，如煤炭、木材等已经在去年提前超额完成。关于钢铁、粮食、发电设备、机床、电力、水泥、机制纸等主要指标也可在今年超额完成、完成或接近完成。
    会议以一系列最有力的事实，驳斥了国内外敌人和一小撮右倾机会主义分子对总路线、大跃进和人民公社的污蔑，他们叫嚣大跃进犯了”“左倾冒险主义”的错误，恶意指责大跃进的“缺点不是一个指头，而是几个指头或一个大拇指。”他们在铁证如山的大跃进的伟大成就面前已经完全破产了。
    会议深刻地分析了黑龙江省去年实现人民公社化的形势和伟大历史意义。以有力的事实说明，这种生产关系的改变，是生产力发展的必然趋势和广大群众的迫切要求。
    事实证明，公社一经出现，就显示了无比优越性和强大生命力，对解放生产力起了伟大的作用。去年秋天，公社刚成立，几乎同时进行紧张的秋收、大规模的翻地、集中运送征购粮等项工作。在黑龙江省这样仅有一千万农村人口的条件下，在一个秋季，就收获了一千多万吨粮食，秋翻了六千多万亩土地，比前年提前一个半月完成了送征购粮的任务，还有七十万人参加大炼钢铁和工业建设等，这样多、这样大的任务，如果不是公社化，是根本不可想像的。特别是公社化后，使农业机械化有了进一步的发展，全省已有三分之一以上的公社，或多或少地有了农业机械。加上全省已有四百多万农民参加公共食堂，使生产力得到大大解放，使农林牧副渔和社办工业得到更大的发展。全省人民公社经过一系列的整顿巩固工作，已经走上巩固的健全发展的道路。事实雄辩地说明人民公社有着无比的优越性。会议认为，公社化的最大优越性还表现在它将永远拔除了生长资本主义的根子，而右倾机会主义分子恋恋不忘的却是资本主义的泛滥，这正是他们所以反对公社化的本质的最好的说明。
    会议着重指出，在全省党组织内，必须深入地进行维护党的团结的教育，要求全省党员自觉地维护党的团结，健全各级党组织的核心领导，向一切不利于党的团结的现象作斗争。
    这次会议以马克思列宁主义的武器，驳斥了一小撮右倾机会主义分子的观点，坚持了建设社会主义的总路线，并且对一小部分有右倾思想和右倾情绪的干部，进行了深入的批评和教育，从思想上政治上进一步把大家武装起来，这将是今后继续大跃进的伟大思想动力。
    会议号召全省党员和全省人民，在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的英明领导下团结一致，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜，反右倾，鼓干劲，进一步深入开展增产节约的群众运动，为实现继续跃进，争取社会主义事业的新的更大的胜利而奋勇前进。
