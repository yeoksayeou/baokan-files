    Phoenix Tree	Su Liang
    It has been over a year since I left Vietnam—this beautiful and heroic nation. Many touching and beautiful memories often surge in my heart, especially those two phoenix trees. How tall have they grown? How old are they? I constantly think about them…
    In Vietnam, everyone loves the phoenix tree, everyone loves the phoenix flower.
    The phoenix tree has green leaves, the phoenix tree has fiery red flowers. In the morning, it greets the morning glow with its smiling face; at night, its fragrance accompanies people to sleep. Yesterday, it ridiculed the enemy with its tenacious and unyielding posture; today, it decorates the heroic nation with its beautiful red flowers.
    When we bid farewell to our Vietnamese brothers, our deep friendship made it hard for us to part. What could we use to commemorate our constantly growing friendship? What could we use to express the beautiful wishes in our hearts? Our enthusiastic host suggested:
    "Let us use our hands that have labored together, with our hands that are tightly clasped, to plant two phoenix trees together!
    "Let us water them more! Dear brothers, comrades, and comrades-in-arms! Let us use the water of the Red River that connects China and Vietnam, the water that sings day and night about the friendship between China and Vietnam, to irrigate it, so that it grows quickly!"
    Grow quickly! You, the phoenix tree that symbolizes friendship. Bloom quickly! You, the phoenix flower that symbolizes beautiful wishes. Forever shining upon you is the sun in the hearts of Chinese brothers, forever nourishing you is the fertile soil of a heroic nation…
    We poured out our hearts under the phoenix tree we planted with our own hands.
    The moment of parting arrived, we held hands, reluctant to part. Our Vietnamese friends said:
    "Today's separation means tomorrow's reunion. On that day, the phoenix tree will have grown tall, the phoenix flowers will be in full bloom. In the morning, it will face the waters of Hoan Kiem Lake, adorning itself with dewdrops, welcoming the first dawn of peaceful unification. At night, it will be on the banks of the Mekong River, covered with red flowers, embracing the joyful crowds who have reunited. Don't you think so?"
    We replied, "That's for sure! On that day, we will definitely reunite under the phoenix tree. That day won't be too far away."
    It's been a year. In this year, I often think of the phoenix trees we planted together with our Vietnamese friends, and I think of our shared wishes. The "September 2nd" holiday is approaching again, let the southward wind carry our wishes:
    "Grow strong, you phoenix tree that symbolizes friendship, you phoenix flower that symbolizes beautiful wishes!"
                            (August 1959, Sanmenxia, Henan)

    凤凰树	苏亮
    离开越南——这美丽的英雄国家已经一年多了，但许多动人的、美好的回忆时常在心头涌现，特别是那两株凤凰树，她们长得多高了？多大了？我时时惦记着……
    在越南，人人喜爱凤凰树，人人喜爱凤凰花。
    凤凰树叶儿青青，凤凰树花儿火红。清晨，用它那笑脸迎接着朝霞；夜晚，用她的清香伴着人们睡下。昨天，曾用它那坚韧不屈的姿态嘲笑着敌人；今天，又用她那美丽的红花装饰着英雄的国家。
    当我们告别越南兄弟的时候，深厚的友谊，使我们难舍难分。用什么纪念我们不断成长的友谊呢？用什么表示我们心中美好的祝愿呢？热情的主人提出建议了：
    “让我们用我们这共同劳动过的手，用我们这紧紧握着的手，来共同种上两株凤凰树吧！
    “让我们多为她浇些水吧！亲爱的兄弟、同志、和战友呀！让我们用那贯连着中国、越南的红河的水，用那日夜歌唱着中、越友谊之水，灌溉着它，让它快快长大吧！”
    快快成长吧！你这象征友谊的凤凰树。快快开放吧！你这象征美好祝愿的凤凰花。永远照耀你的是中国兄弟心中的太阳，永远滋补你的是英雄国家肥沃的土壤……
    我们在亲手种的凤凰树下，倾诉着心曲。
    分别的时刻到了，我们手握着手，依依不舍。越南朋友说：
    “今天的分离意味着明日的相见。在那一天，凤凰树长大了，凤凰花盛开了，清晨，它对着还剑湖水，用露珠妆扮着自己，迎接和平统一的第一个黎明。夜晚，它会在湄公河畔，她披满红花，拥抱着团聚了的欢乐人群。你说是吗？”
    我们回答说：“那是一定的！在那一天，我们一定会在凤凰树下重逢。这一天不会太遥远。”
    一年了。这一年里，我时常想起我们同越南朋友一起种的凤凰树，想起我们的共同的心愿。“九二”节又快到了，让南去的风，带去我们的祝愿：
    “茁壮地成长吧，你这象征着友谊的凤凰树，你这象征着美好祝愿的凤凰花”
