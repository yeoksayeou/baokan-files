    Continuously Improve the Quality of Converter Steel
    For the past few years, China's converter steel plants have made unremitting efforts to improve the quality of steel, producing millions of tons of good-quality steel ingots. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, converter steel production has developed vigorously, and the quality has also improved significantly. The average qualified rate of converter steel in key enterprises nationwide has risen from 67.86% in January of this year to 91.83% in July. The first-grade product rate of Tangshan Steel Plant was only 19.5% in June, but reached 69.7% in July. The first-grade product rate of Tianjin No. 4 Steel Plant reached 96.63% in July. This is encouraging news. The current problem is to consolidate the existing achievements and, at the same time, improve technology and further comprehensively improve the quality of steel. In addition to eliminating sulfur hazards, we must also control the four elements of carbon, manganese, silicon, and phosphorus to improve the qualification rate, produce more first-grade products, and eliminate zero-grade steel. Enable converter steel production to undertake a more glorious task.
    Summarizing the experience of various factories in comprehensively improving the quality of steel, it can be mainly summarized as the following points: First, steelmaking units should implement fixed-point supply of coke and pig iron, strengthen raw material classification management, and resolutely eliminate sulfur in the iron-melting furnace. After Qingdao City adopted the hot-blast alkaline iron-melting furnace, it fundamentally solved the problem of making good steel with high-sulfur pig iron. At present, all other steel plants that use alkaline iron-melting furnaces or alkaline operation acidic iron-melting furnaces have seen significant improvements in their first-grade product rates. For example, the improvement of the first-grade product rate in Tianjin No. 4 Steel Plant is mainly due to the alkaline iron-melting furnace. Second, improve converter operation, control the content of carbon, manganese, silicon, and phosphorus, and eliminate post-blowing. Third, improve ingot casting work. Fourth, improve the quality of raw materials.
    Resolutely adopting various alkaline-operation iron-melting furnaces is an important gateway to improving the quality of converter steel. The quality of the iron-melting furnace work has a great relationship with the quality of converter production. Converter workers must make the greatest determination to eliminate sulfur in the iron-melting furnace. Qingdao City has basically broken through the technical barrier of the hot-blast alkaline iron-melting furnace. Although the technical level still needs to be continuously improved, as long as the direction is right and we resolutely continue to work hard, we will definitely create more experience.
    Converter steelmaking must pay special attention to eliminating the problem of "post-blowing" (continuing blowing when the carbon reaches 0.06% at the end is called "post-blowing"). "Post-blowing" has adverse consequences for production and outweighs the gains. Post-blowing not only reduces the quality and yield of steel, but also seriously increases the consumption of iron and steel materials and reduces the life of the furnace. The slagging, desulfurization, and temperature increase in converter steelmaking must be solved by other measures (such as hot-blast alkaline operation iron-melting furnace, increasing the silicon content of pig iron, shortening the blowing time, reducing the size of limestone, etc.). In fact, only by eliminating post-blowing can we ensure reducing the consumption of iron and steel materials, improve the life of the furnace, and increase production.
    Improving ingot casting work is also an important measure to improve the quality of steel ingots. The experience of Qingdao City in comprehensively improving the quality of converter steel, published in this newspaper today, includes improving ingot casting work as one of the main experiences. At present, due to the strict implementation of the ingot casting operating system in Qingdao City, the surface quality of steel ingots has surpassed many large factories. These systems, such as baking the steel ladle until red-hot, cleaning the steel flow brick and steel ingot mold, oiling the steel ingot mold, using appropriate pouring speed, and using cold water to seal the top and fill the gaps with fine streams (small killed steel ingots), have greatly improved the qualification rate of steel ingots, reduced short ingots, improved the surface of steel ingots, reduced internal shrinkage cavities in steel ingots, and improved the quality and yield of steel.
    Improving the quality of raw materials is also closely related to improving the quality of steel. We must vigorously improve the quality of coke and limestone. If the coke has small size, low strength, and high sulfur content; the composition of limestone fluctuates greatly, or has high silicon dioxide content, or high magnesium oxide content, it is difficult to make good steel.
    Now is the time to comprehensively improve the quality of converter steel. Only high quality can lead to high output, and only high quality can save raw materials. Converter steelmaking is a new force on the iron and steel industry front in our country. It is young, growing fast, and has great potential. It has played a great role in steel production this year and will play an even greater role in the future. It is hoped that all regions will vigorously support and lead this new force, so that more red-flag units will emerge in the movement of high-yield, high-quality, and low-cost converter steel.

### 不断提高转炉钢的质量

    不断提高转炉钢的质量
    我国转炉钢厂过去几年来一直为提高钢的质量而进行不懈的努力，生产了数百万吨质量良好的钢锭。去年大跃进以来，转炉钢生产有了蓬勃的发展，质量也有显著的进步。全国重点企业的转炉钢平均合格率已从今年1月的67.86％上升为7月份的91.83％。唐山钢厂6月份一级品率还只有19.5％，7月份已达到了69.7％，天津四钢厂7月份一级品率已达到96.63％。这是可喜的消息。目前的问题是要巩固已有成果，同时，还要提高技术，更进一步全面提高钢的质量。除了排除硫害以外还要从控制碳、锰、矽、磷四种元素来提高合格率，多出一级品、消灭零号钢。使转炉钢的生产担负起更光荣的任务。
  总结各厂全面提高钢的质量的经验，主要可以归纳为以下几点：第一，炼钢单位，实行焦炭、生铁定点供应，加强原料分级管理，坚决把硫消灭在化铁炉内。青岛市采用了热风碱性化铁炉后，从根本上解决了用高硫生铁炼好钢的问题。目前凡是采用碱性化铁炉或碱性操作酸性化铁炉的其他钢厂，一级品率都得到了显著的提高，如天津四钢厂一级品率的提高，碱性化铁炉是主要措施。第二，改善转炉操作，控制碳、锰、矽、磷含量，消灭后吹。第三，改进铸锭工作。第四、改善原材料质量。
    坚决采用各种碱性操作的化铁炉，是提高转炉钢质量的重要门径。化铁炉工作的良好与否对转炉生产良好与否关系很大，转炉工作者必须下最大决心把硫消灭在化铁炉内。青岛市已经基本突破了热风碱性化铁炉的技术关，虽然技术水平还需要继续提高，但是只要方向对了，坚决干下去，一定能创造出更多的经验来。
    转炉炼钢目前要特别注意消灭“后吹”问题（炭到终点0.06％时尚继续吹炼称“后吹”），“后吹”对生产有恶劣后果，得不偿失。后吹不但降低钢的质量与成材率，而且严重增加钢铁料消耗与降低炉子寿命。转炉炼钢的化渣、去硫与提温，一定要采取其他措施来解决，（如热风碱性操作化铁炉、提高生铁含矽量、缩短吹炼时间、减小石灰块度等）事实上只有消灭后吹才能保证降低钢铁料消耗，提高炉子寿命，增加产量。
    改善铸锭工作，也是提高钢锭质量的重要措施之一。本报今天发表的青岛市全面提高转炉钢质量的经验，其中主要经验之一是改进铸锭工作。目前，青岛市由于严格贯彻铸锭操作制度，钢锭的表面质量已超过了不少大型工厂。这些制度，诸如烤红钢包、清刷流钢砖与钢锭模、钢锭模涂油、采用合适的浇注速度、采用冷水封顶细流填补（小型镇静钢锭）等等，大大提高了钢锭合格率，减少了短锭，改进了钢锭表面，减小钢锭内部缩孔，提高了钢材质量与成材率。
    改进原材料的质量也是与提高钢的质量密切相关的。必须大力提高焦炭和石灰的质量，如果焦炭的块度小、强度低、硫磺高；石灰的成份波动大或二氧化矽高、氧化镁高，都难以炼成好钢。
    现在，是全面提高转炉钢质量的时候了，优质才能高产，优质才能节约原材料。转炉炼钢是我国钢铁工业战线上一支新生力量，年纪青、成长快、潜力大，在今年钢的生产中已起着很大的作用，今后还将发挥更大的作用。希望各地大力扶植与领导这一新生力量，让转炉钢在高产、优质、低成本的运动中出现更多的红旗单位。
