Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 23rd: A high tide of winter wheat sowing is sweeping across the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. As of mid-September, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had sown more than 4 million mu of winter wheat.

This year, Xinjiang plans to sow 11 million mu of winter wheat, an increase of more than 2 million mu over last year. The people's communes in various places started early and did a good job in preparation, and the sowing work was also timely and meticulous. In the colder northern Xinjiang, such as the counties directly under the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, the sowing work generally started about ten days earlier than last year. In the warmer southern Xinjiang, a timely and concentrated sowing was also carried out in mid-September. Currently, more than 90% of the winter wheat that has been sown is row-sown.

As early as late June and early July, when the summer harvest had just begun, the Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture and the Kashgar Special District in southern Xinjiang promptly convened on-site wheat meetings in the northern Xinjiang area and Kashgar Special District, respectively. These meetings summarized the experience of increasing wheat production, proposed specific measures for planting and planting well this year's winter wheat, and formulated a winter wheat sowing plan. According to the arrangements of the leading organs, the people's communes in various places extracted about 10% of their labor force during the summer harvest to carry out summer plowing while harvesting, plowing each piece of land as it was harvested. As a result, about 50% of the wheat land this year has undergone summer plowing, with a plowing depth generally between 18 centimeters and 25 centimeters. The communes also organized land reclamation expeditions and professional teams to actively reclaim wasteland and resolutely implement the policy of planting more and harvesting more. The Hotan Special District originally planned to increase the planting of winter wheat by 150,000 mu, but before sowing at the end of August, it had reclaimed 180,000 mu of wasteland. Due to the early summer plowing and land reclamation, the winter wheat area of the counties directly under the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture will be expanded by more than 40% this year compared with last year.

In order to ensure the quality of winter wheat sowing and strive to prevent or minimize the occurrence of third-class seedlings (poor quality seedlings), various places have conscientiously implemented production increase measures such as seed selection, land leveling, and increased fertilization. In the Kashgar Special District, due to the adoption of block selection, ear selection, single harvesting, single threshing, and single storage seed selection methods during the summer harvest, the winter wheat seeds prepared this year are more than 85% improved varieties. More than 290,000 mu of winter wheat that has been sown in the Aksu Special District has been fertilized with base fertilizer, with an amount of about 5,000 jin per mu. The 160,000 mu of winter wheat in Moyu County, Hotan Special District, has an average of about 20,000 jin of fertilizer prepared per mu.

At present, a production upsurge striving to overfulfill the winter wheat sowing plan is vigorously developing in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. The average sowing progress in the entire autonomous region reaches more than 20 mu per day. After Yining County of Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture put forward the slogan of planting more and planting good wheat to present as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country, the sowing progress has increased more than threefold. Members of the communes in Yingjisha County, in order to realize the plan of working hard for 20 days to plant 170,000 mu of winter wheat well as a gift to the National Day ahead of schedule, have launched a competition to compare their enthusiasm, progress, and quality. In the past six days, the county has sown more than 50,000 mu of winter wheat and plowed 80,000 mu of wheat land.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 23rd: Henan Province, one of the major wheat-producing areas in China, has successively started a tense and busy wheat planting battle in the Yubei, Yuxi mountainous areas, and Yuedong saline-alkali land. As of the 18th, these areas had sown more than 1.61 million mu of wheat.

Various places attach great importance to rational close planting, deep plowing and leveling, and applying sufficient base fertilizer when planting wheat. In order to create experience for the comprehensive wheat planting, Wangji Commune in Dongming County, Kaifeng Special District, drew more than 2,350 people, including party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and wheat planting experts, from various production teams to form 349 battle groups, implementing large-scale collaboration, and planting more than 13,500 mu of wheat in one day. According to the experience of increasing wheat production on alkaline land last year, Wuqiang Commune in Shangqiu County started deep plowing, fertilizing, leveling, and soil treatment of alkaline land half a month ago. On the basis of basically relieving the alkaline reaction, the commune adopted the method of leaders going to the fields, sowing, inspecting, accepting, evaluating, solving problems, and promoting at the same time, so that the 8,000 mu of wheat that has been sown is not only fast but also of good quality.

A large-scale wheat planting battle will soon be fully launched throughout the province. At present, members of the people's communes in various places are actively preparing for wheat planting. More than 1.68 million members of the people's communes in Kaifeng Special District, fighting on the banks of the Yellow River and the thousand-mile plain on both sides of the Shahe River, are rushing to repair various canals, deepen pits and ponds, and tap wellsprings to ensure that wheat is sown well without rain. They have completed 13,928,800 cubic meters of earth, brick, and stone, which can expand the irrigation area by about 2.73 million mu. At the same time, they have also transformed 3.65 million mu of uneven land into garden-like fields and irrigated 730,000 mu of base moisture water. The people's communes in the mountainous and hilly areas of Xinxiang Special District have sent a large number of water source exploration teams to find ways to divert water to the mountains and hills to ensure that wheat is planted well. While building, repairing, digging, and finding water conservancy projects and water sources on a large scale, the upsurge of deep plowing and accumulating and transporting fertilizer is rising higher and higher. During the autumn harvest, the people's communes in Nanyang Special District implemented the practice of plowing as they harvested, plowing each piece of land as it was harvested. So far, they have deep-plowed more than 4 million mu of land and applied sufficient base fertilizer to all of it. The 4,649 production brigades in Xinyang Special District have accumulated 50 to 100 dan of fertilizer for each mu of wheat land.

This year, due to the long-term drought and high temperature in Henan Province, the wheat planting time will be 7 to 10 days earlier than last year. For this reason, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference of the secretaries of the local and municipal party committees on the 19th, listened to the report on the progress of the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and planting) work, and requested that various places resolutely fight drought to the end and plant enough wheat in a timely manner on the basis of ensuring quality and quantity.

    新疆河南开始秋播
    多种麦  迎国庆
    据新华社乌鲁木齐23日电　冬小麦播种高潮席卷天山南北。截至9月中旬，全新疆维吾尔自治区已经播种冬小麦四百多万亩。
    今年新疆计划播种冬麦一千一百万亩，比去年扩大二百多万亩。各地人民公社准备工作动手早、作得好，播种工作也适时细致。气候较冷的北疆各地，像伊犁哈萨克族自治州直属各县，播种工作普遍比去年提早了十天左右。较暖的南疆各地，也普遍在9月中旬适时突击播种。目前已播下的冬麦，条播占90％以上。
    早在6月底7月初夏收刚刚开始时，自治区农业厅和南疆喀什专区就及时分别召开了北疆地区和喀什专区的小麦现场会议，总结了小麦增产经验，提出了多种和种好今年冬麦的具体措施，制订了冬麦播种计划。各地人民公社根据领导机关的安排，在夏收期间就抽出10％左右的劳力，边收割边伏耕，收一块耕一块，使今年50％左右的麦地都经过了伏耕，耕深一般在十八厘米到二十五厘米左右。各地公社还组织了开荒远征队、专业队，积极开荒造田，坚决贯彻多种多收的方针。和田专区原计划增种冬麦十五万亩，但是在8月底播种以前就开出了荒地十八万亩。由于提早进行了伏耕、开荒造田，今年伊犁哈萨克族自治州直属各县的冬麦面积将比去年扩大40％以上。
    为了保证冬麦播种质量，力争不出和少出三类苗，各地都认真贯彻了选种、平地、多施肥等增产措施。喀什专区由于在夏收中采取了块选、穗选、单收、单打、单入仓的选种办法，今年准备的冬麦种子，优良籽种占85％以上。阿克苏专区已经播下的二十九万多亩冬麦，全部施了底肥，每亩达五千斤左右。和田专区墨玉县的十六万亩冬麦，平均每亩已经备有肥料两万斤左右。
    目前，力争超额完成冬麦播种计划的生产高潮，正在天山南北蓬勃发展，全自治区播种进度平均每天达二十多亩。伊犁哈萨克族自治州伊宁县提出多种、种好小麦向建国十周年献礼的口号后，播种进度提高三倍以上。英吉沙县各公社社员，为了提前实现苦战二十天种好十七万亩冬麦向国庆献礼的计划，已经展开了比干劲、比进度、比质量的竞赛运动，最近六天，全县就种冬麦五万多亩，犁好了八万亩麦地。
    新华社郑州23日电　我国主要小麦产区之一的河南省紧张繁忙的种麦战役，从豫北、豫西山区和豫东盐碱地带先后揭开了序幕。到18日止，这些区已经种下小麦一百六十一万多亩。
    各地在种麦时对合理密植、深耕平整、施足底肥等都非常重视。开封专区东明县王集公社为了给全面开展种麦创造经验，从各生产队抽调了包括党、团员、种麦能手在内的二千三百五十多人，组成三百四十九个战斗组，实行大协作，一天种麦一万三千五百多亩。商丘县坞墙公社根据去年碱地小麦增产的经验，早在半个月以前就开始了对碱地进行深翻、施肥、平整和土壤处理。在基本解除了碱性发作的基础上，采取领导到田、边播种、边检查、边验收、边评比、边解决问题、边促进的方法，使已经播种的八千亩小麦，不仅速度快，而且质量好。
    全省大规模的种麦战役即将全面展开。目前，各地人民公社社员正在积极作好种麦前的准备工作。开封专区战斗在黄河之滨、沙河两岸千里平原上的一百六十八万多名公社社员，为确保无雨种好小麦，正在抢修各种渠道、加深坑塘、掏井下泉。已经完成土、砖、石方一千三百九十二万八千公方，约可扩大灌溉面积二百七十三万亩，与此同时，还把三百六十五万亩高低不平的土地修成园田化。并灌浇了七十三万亩底墒水。新乡专区山区和丘陵地区的人民公社，为保证把麦种好，派出大批水源查勘队，千方百计引水上山、上岗。各地在大建、大修、大挖、大找水利工程和水源的同时，深翻土地、积肥送肥高潮，一浪高过一浪。南阳专区各人民公社在收秋时，即实行了随收随翻，收一块翻一块，到目前止，已经深翻土地四百多万亩，全部施足了底肥。信阳专区四千六百四十九个生产大队已为每亩麦地积造了五十担至一百担肥料。
    今年，河南省由于久旱少雨，气温高，种麦时间将比去年提前七到十天。为此，中共河南省委于19日召开了各地、市委书记电话会议，听取了“三秋”工作进展情况的汇报，并要求各地坚决抗旱到底，在保质保量的基础上，适时地把小麦种足种好。（附图片）
