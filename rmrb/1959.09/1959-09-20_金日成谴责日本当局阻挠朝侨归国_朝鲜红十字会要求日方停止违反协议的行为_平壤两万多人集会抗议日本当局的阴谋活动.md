Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 19th: According to Pyongyang newspapers today, Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of North Korea, recently met with Korean youth and students from Japan who have returned to their homeland and sternly condemned the recent actions of the Japanese authorities in rudely violating the agreement signed by the Red Cross societies of North Korea and Japan and openly plotting a conspiracy to obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

Premier Kim Il-sung emphasized that the Japanese authorities, together with the Syngman Rhee clique, are attempting to use the issue of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan as a bargaining chip in political negotiations, which is something the entire Korean people cannot tolerate. The Japanese authorities must immediately abandon this perfidious behavior and promptly repatriate Korean residents in Japan in accordance with the agreement signed by the delegations of the Red Cross societies of both countries.

Premier Kim Il-sung spoke during the meeting about the consistent and sincere efforts made by the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic to realize the early fulfillment of the wishes of Korean residents in Japan to return home. He said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made all preparations to welcome the return of Korean residents in Japan and is currently awaiting them.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 19th: Pyongyang newspapers today published a statement issued on the 18th by Kim Ung-gi, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross Society, stating that the actions of the Japanese Red Cross Society in deliberately obstructing the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan have rudely trampled on the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan signed by the Red Cross societies of North Korea and Japan.

The statement said that a month has passed since the Red Cross societies of North Korea and Japan signed the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. Not only the Korean people, but also the Japanese people and all those in the world who respect human rights and freedom are looking forward to Japan strictly repatriating Korean residents in Japan in accordance with the agreement. However, the ink was barely dry on the agreement signed by the Red Cross societies of North Korea and Japan when the Japanese Red Cross Society openly began to rudely violate the agreement, publishing a so-called "Guide to Repatriation" for Korean residents on September 3rd. This "Guide to Repatriation" stipulates that the Japanese Red Cross Society must examine the "free will" of Korean residents in Japan applying for repatriation and establish a "special room" at the port of embarkation, Niigata, to "confirm" their "intentions."

The statement said that this is an attempt to overturn the sacred agreement reached during the talks between North Korea and Japan and a vain attempt to force Korean residents in Japan to change their will to return home.

The statement said that the "Guide to Repatriation" also specifically stipulates that Korean residents in Japan who are departing for repatriation will be imprisoned in sealed carriages, prohibited from all contact with the outside world, and even unable to meet with their own relatives and friends. The statement pointed out that this is an attempt to treat Korean residents in Japan who are returning home according to their own will as prisoners, a rude trampling of human rights.

The statement said that in order to further restrict Korean residents in Japan who are applying for repatriation, the Japanese Red Cross Society announced that it would only begin accepting repatriation applications from September 21st and that those who wish to board the first and second repatriation ships would need to submit their applications within five days before September 25th. The Japanese authorities even instructed the police to illegally arrest Korean residents in Japan who wished to return home in Niigata on September 13th.

The statement said that all these facts are clear evidence that the Japanese side is most rudely violating the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan signed by the Red Cross societies of North Korea and Japan.

The statement said that the behavior taken by the Japanese Red Cross Society is a blatant challenge to humanitarianism, an attempt to undermine the desire of Korean residents in Japan to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and a blatant act of perfidy. This behavior is in line with the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique to desperately oppose the return of Korean residents in Japan to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The statement said that the Korean people will never tolerate the Japanese Red Cross Society treating the issue of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan as a bargaining chip in political negotiations, instead of correctly implementing the repatriation agreement in strict accordance with humanitarian principles. The Korean people once again strongly demand that the Japanese side immediately cease all conspiracies to obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan and correctly fulfill its obligation to repatriate Korean residents in Japan as stipulated in the agreement. If the Japanese side violates the agreement between North Korea and Japan in pursuit of illegitimate political goals and does not abandon its attempts to obstruct the return of Korean residents in Japan to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, then it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 19th: Under the auspices of the Korean Fatherland Front, more than 20,000 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a mass rally at the open-air theater at 6 p.m. today, condemning the Japanese authorities' conspiracy to obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

The masses participating in the rally were in an extremely agitated mood, constantly raising their arms and shouting slogans such as "Oppose the Japanese authorities' conspiracy to obstruct the return of Korean residents in Japan" and "Repatriate Korean residents in Japan as soon as possible."

Park Kum-chul, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the issue of the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Korean residents in Japan is an important issue of concern not only to the Korean people but also to the people of the world. The Red Cross societies of North Korea and Japan signed an agreement on this issue a month ago. Now the only thing left is for the Japanese side to let Korean residents in Japan board ships to return home. However, the Japanese authorities have recently begun to carry out a conspiracy against the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. We are surprised by this two-faced attitude of the Japanese authorities, which is a violation of the agreement, a trampling on international practice, and an inhumane attitude. We will never tolerate this attitude of the Japanese authorities. Park Kum-chul said: Under the manipulation of the United States, the Japanese authorities want to resume the so-called "South Korea-Japan talks" with the Syngman Rhee clique while the ink is barely dry on the agreement signed by the Red Cross societies of North Korea and Japan, discussing the "legal status issue" and the "compensation issue" of Korean residents in Japan.

He said: The government of the Republic has stated several times that the Japanese authorities cannot hold any unilateral talks with the Syngman Rhee clique. The Syngman Rhee clique is not qualified to talk about the legal status of Korean residents in Japan. We strongly demand that the Japanese side stop the talks with the Syngman Rhee clique.

Park Kum-chul said: We condemn the Japanese side's behavior in violating the agreement and strongly demand that the Japanese authorities immediately repatriate Korean residents in Japan in accordance with the agreement. This is an unavoidable obligation on the part of Japan.

Those who participated in today's meeting included: Korean party and government leaders Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Park Jung-ae, Kim Chang-man, Chung Il-ryong, Nam Il, as well as leaders of the Fatherland Front, various democratic parties, and social organizations.

Kang Ryang-wook, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Party, Park Shin-deok, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, as well as heads of various social organizations and representatives of people from all walks of life spoke at the meeting. They unanimously strongly demanded that the Japanese authorities immediately stop violating the agreement and obstructing the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, and repatriate Korean residents in Japan home as soon as possible.

The meeting finally adopted a letter in the name of the Korean political parties, social organizations, and people from all walks of life to the Japanese political parties, social organizations, and people from all walks of life, condemning the Japanese authorities' conspiracy to obstruct the return of Korean residents in Japan, and expressing firm belief that Japan's progressive political parties, social organizations, and people from all walks of life will oppose this behavior of the Japanese authorities and support the early return of Korean residents in Japan.

    金日成谴责日本当局阻挠朝侨归国
    朝鲜红十字会要求日方停止违反协议的行为
    平壤两万多人集会抗议日本当局的阴谋活动
    新华社平壤19日电　据平壤报纸今天报道，朝鲜内阁首相金日成最近接见已经回到祖国的旅日朝鲜青年学生的时候，严正指责了最近日本当局粗暴地违反朝日两国红十字会签订的协议，公然策划阻挠旅日朝侨归国的阴谋。
    金日成首相强调指出，日本当局同李承晚集团一起企图把旅日朝侨归国的问题作为在政治上讨价还价的资本，这是全体朝鲜人民不能容许的事情。日本当局必须立即放弃这种背信弃义的行为，严格根据两国红十字会代表团签订的协议早日遣送旅日朝侨回国。
    金日成首相在接见时谈到了朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为了旅日朝侨归国的愿望早日实现而一贯采取有诚意的努力的政策。他说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为了迎接旅日朝侨归国已经做好了一切准备，目前正在等待着他们。
    新华社平壤19日电　平壤报纸今天刊登了朝鲜红十字会中央委员会委员长金应基在18日发表的声明，声明指出，日本红十字会蓄意阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民归国的行为，粗暴地蹂躏了朝日两国红十字会签订的关于旅日朝鲜侨民归国的协议。
    声明说，朝日两国红十字会签订了关于旅日朝鲜侨民归国的协议已经有一个月了。不仅是朝鲜人民，就是日本人民和全世界尊重人类权利和自由的人们都期待着日本方面严格根据协议遣送旅日朝鲜侨民归国。但是，朝日两国红十字会在协议上签字的墨迹未干，日本红十字会就公然开始粗暴地违反协议，在9月3日发表了所谓朝鲜侨民的“回国指南”，这个“回国指南”规定，日本红十字会要审查申请归国的旅日朝鲜侨民的“自由意志”，并且在乘船的地方新澙港设立“特别室”，“确认”他们的“意愿”。
    声明说，这是企图推翻朝日双方会谈中的神圣公约，妄想强迫旅日朝鲜侨民改变他们的归国意志。
    声明说，“回国指南”还特别规定，启程归国的旅日朝鲜侨民将被监禁在密封的车厢里，禁止同外界的一切联系，甚至不能同自己的亲友见面。声明指出，这是企图把根据自己意志归国的旅日朝鲜侨民当做囚犯处理的粗暴地蹂躏人权的行为。
    声明说，日本红十字会为了进一步限制申请归国的旅日朝鲜侨民，宣布从9月21日才开始接受归国申请书，并且宣布乘第一艘和第二艘归国轮船的人需要在9月25日以前的五天以内提出申请。日本当局甚至于9月13日指使警察在新澙非法逮捕了希望归国的旅日朝鲜侨民。
    声明说，所有这些事实都是日本方面最粗暴地违反朝日两国红十字会签订的关于旅日朝鲜侨民归国协议的明显证据。
    声明说，日本红十字会采取的这种行为是对人道主义的露骨的挑战，是企图破坏旅日朝鲜侨民实现回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的愿望，是露骨的背信弃义的行为。这种行为是为了符合美帝国主义和李承晚集团拚命反对旅日朝鲜侨民回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的阴谋。
    声明说，朝鲜人民绝不能容忍日本红十字会把旅日朝鲜侨民的归国问题当做在政治上讨价还价的资本，以此来代替应该严格根据人道主义原则来正确执行归国协议。朝鲜人民再一次强烈要求日本方面立即停止为阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民归国而制造的一切阴谋，正确地履行协议所赋予它的遣送旅日朝鲜侨民归国的义务。如果日本方面为了追求不正当的政治目的，违反朝日双方的协议，不放弃阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的企图，那么它必须对由此而引起的一切后果负全部责任。
    新华社平壤19日电　在朝鲜祖国战线的主持下，平壤市各界人民两万多人今天下午六时在露天剧场举行群众大会，谴责日本当局阻挠旅日朝侨归国的阴谋活动。
  参加大会的群众情绪异常激愤，他们不断振臂高呼：“反对日本当局阻挠旅日朝侨回国的阴谋”，“早日把旅日朝侨遣送回国”等口号。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金喆在会上讲了话。他指出，数十万旅日朝侨归国的问题，不仅是朝鲜人民而且是世界人民关心的重要问题。朝日两国红十字会在一个月前已经就这个问题签订了协议。现在只剩下日本方面让旅日朝侨乘船回国的问题了。但是，日本当局最近开始进行反对旅日朝侨归国的阴谋活动。我们对日本当局的这种表里不一的态度感到惊讶，这是违反协议、蹂躏国际惯例的、非人道主义的态度。我们决不能容忍日本当局的这种态度。朴金喆说：在美国的操纵下，日本当局在朝日两国红十字会签订协议的墨迹未干的时候还要恢复同李承晚集团的所谓“韩日会谈”，谈什么旅日朝侨的“法律地位问题”和“赔偿问题”。
    他说：共和国政府曾经数次声明日本当局不能同李承晚集团进行任何片面的会谈。李承晚集团没有资格谈旅日朝侨的法律地位。我们强硬要求日本方面停止同李承晚集团的会谈。
    朴金喆说：我们谴责日本方面违反协议的行为，强硬要求日本当局立即根据协议把旅日朝侨遣送回国。这是日本方面不可逃避的义务。
    参加今天大会的有：朝鲜党和政府的领导人金一、洪命熹、朴正爱、金昌满、郑一龙、南日，以及祖国战线，各民主政党、社会团体的负责人等。
    北朝鲜民主党中央委员会委员长康良煜，天道教青友党中央委员会委员长朴信德以及各社会团体的负责人，各界人民的代表都在大会上讲了话。他们一致强硬要求日本当局立即停止违反协议阻挠旅日朝侨回国的行为，早日遣送旅日朝侨回家。
    大会最后通过了以朝鲜各政党、社会团体和各界人民的名义给日本各政党、社会团体和各界人民的信，信中谴责了日本当局阻挠旅日朝侨回国的阴谋活动，表示坚信日本的进步政党、社会团体以及各界人民将反对日本当局的这种行为，支持旅日朝侨早日回国。
