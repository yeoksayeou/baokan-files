    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa. Workers of all ethnic groups in Lhasa are further formulating new measures for increasing production and practicing economy, and continuing the Great Leap Forward, to support the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.
    On August 31st, the workers of the transportation system under the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held a rally to resolutely implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. At the rally, the workers pledged to complete the annual transportation task ahead of schedule and exceeding the target on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in the first half of the year. This year, with basically no increase in vehicles, the ton-kilometers completed by the workers from January to August increased by 35.7% compared with the same period last year. By the end of August, more than eighty car drivers had created safe, economical, and ten-thousand-ton-kilometer-per-ton-per-month achievements, while there was only one person in the whole year last year. The workers of the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory saved more than 25,000 yuan for the country in July and August by using old materials. Now they have put forward the slogan of "Great Victory in August, Great Triumph in September, to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day." After several months of hard work, the workers of this factory have reduced the man-hour cost from the original three yuan to two yuan and twenty-five cents, and they are determined to further reduce the man-hour cost. The workers of the No. 3 Team of the Tibet Transportation Bureau promised to complete the third-quarter transportation task seven days ahead of schedule.
    The Tibetan and Han workers of the Lhasa Construction Engineering Office are carrying out a technical innovation movement. At the rally held on August 31, they set up a challenge arena, and each work area and type of work launched challenges and responses, proposing to work hard for a month to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day, and to save more funds for the country on the basis of saving more than 49,000 yuan in August. Efforts should be made to achieve vehicle-ization, mechanization, or semi-mechanization in quarrying, processing, and brick and tile production. The workers undertaking the construction tasks of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, such as the clubhouse, have pledged to complete the work twenty days ahead of schedule, before the National Day. In July and August, the workers of the processing plant had manufactured five indigenous machines and improved six kinds of tools, increasing work efficiency by seven to eight times. Now the workers said that they would manufacture an automatic unloading cart in September and improve ten kinds of tools, strive to achieve vehicle-ization of transportation in October, and achieve semi-mechanization of production before the end of the year, and double the savings of 8,600 yuan in the first two months of the third quarter.
    The resolutions and communiques of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party are now being widely disseminated among workers and citizens of all ethnic groups in Lhasa. Many cadres of agencies are also conducting studies and discussions, and they are determined to implement the spirit of the resolutions and communiques in their daily work.
