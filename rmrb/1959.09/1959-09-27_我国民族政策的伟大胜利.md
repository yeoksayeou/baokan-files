The Brilliant Decade

    The Great Victory of Our Country's Ethnic Policy
    Vice Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission Wang Feng
    Ten years ago, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups in China achieved a nationwide victory in the people's democratic revolution and established the People's Republic of China.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China ended the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in our country, abolished the system of national oppression, and opened a new socialist era of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and common development for all ethnic groups in our country.
    From the day the People's Republic of China was founded, our country entered a period of transition from capitalism to socialism. The general task of the state during the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. According to this general task, the tasks of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China in domestic ethnic issues are: "To consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups, and jointly build the big family of the motherland; within the unified big family of the motherland, to guarantee the equality of all ethnic groups in all rights, implement ethnic regional autonomy, help minority ethnic groups carry out social reforms, develop the economy, politics, and culture, gradually eliminate the de facto inequalities between ethnic groups historically left behind, enable backward ethnic groups to join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups, and jointly transition to a socialist society." This is a great historical task. The realization of this task will enable all ethnic groups in our country to achieve complete equality not only politically but also economically and culturally. It will enable all ethnic groups in our country to enter a higher stage of development in human history—the communist stage—on the basis of high development and prosperity, thereby fundamentally and thoroughly resolving the ethnic issues in our country.
        The Fundamental Principles of Our Country's Handling of Domestic Ethnic Relations
    National unification, equality and unity among all ethnic groups, mutual assistance and cooperation, and common development are the fundamental principles of our country's handling of domestic ethnic relations. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The unification of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups within the country are the basic guarantees for the inevitable victory of our cause."
    National equality is the political foundation of our national unity and ethnic solidarity, and it is also the basic principle that the Chinese Communist Party has always followed in resolving ethnic issues. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates that all citizens of our country, regardless of ethnicity or race, enjoy equal rights, and prohibits oppression and discrimination against any ethnicity. That is to say, any acts of ethnic oppression and discrimination are illegal in our country. All ethnic groups in our country, regardless of size or stage of social development, enjoy completely equal rights in national and social life, have the freedom to obtain full development, and are masters of our country. Over the past decade, in order to safeguard the equal rights and autonomous rights of minority ethnic groups and implement the policy of ethnic equality and solidarity, our Party and state have not only conducted widespread and in-depth publicity and education on ethnic equality, unity, mutual assistance, and friendship among the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, but have also promulgated a series of laws and decisions. At the same time, the electoral law of our country also includes special chapters on the elections of representatives of minority ethnic groups to the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels, providing special and necessary consideration for minority ethnic groups, so that all minority ethnic groups can equally participate in the management and decision-making of state affairs. In order to implement the policy of ethnic equality and unity, the Central People's Government has also dispatched six visiting groups to visit minority ethnic areas throughout the country, including the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, to convey the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao Zedong's concern and solicitude for the minority ethnic groups. All of these have played a very important role in implementing the Chinese Communist Party's policy of ethnic equality and unity, strengthening the unity and unification of all ethnic groups in our country.
    Ethnic Regional Autonomy is the Basic Policy for Resolving Domestic Ethnic Issues
    Ethnic regional autonomy is the basic policy of the Chinese Communist Party for resolving ethnic issues in our country.
    The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "Regional autonomy is practiced in areas where minority ethnic groups live in concentrated communities. All ethnic autonomous areas are inseparable parts of the People's Republic of China." According to the Constitution, the autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous areas at all levels (autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties), under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, enjoy various autonomous rights in addition to exercising the functions and powers of general local state organs.
    The essence of ethnic regional autonomy is to ensure that, within the unified big family of the motherland, minority ethnic groups with their own concentrated communities of varying sizes (which can constitute an administrative autonomous unit at one level) have the right to be masters of their own affairs and manage their own local affairs, to safeguard the equal status of minority ethnic groups, to give full play to the enthusiasm of all minority ethnic groups in participating in national political life and building socialism, and to continuously enhance mutual trust and friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups.
    Ethnic regional autonomy, as the basic policy for resolving ethnic issues in our country, is based on the theoretical principles of Marxism-Leninism on ethnic issues and is determined in combination with the historical conditions and current situation of ethnic groups in our country.
    When discussing the issue of national self-determination, Lenin once said: "The absolute requirement of Marxism is that in analyzing any issue, the issue must be placed within a certain historical scope, and that when discussing a certain country (for example, discussing the country's ethnic program), attention must be paid to the specific characteristics that distinguish the country from other countries within the same historical era." "Each country is different due to differences in the speed of national development, the ethnic composition of the residents, the distribution of the residents, etc. If all these general historical conditions and specific national conditions are not taken into account, it is impossible to begin formulating the ethnic program of Marxists in that country."
    Our country is a country composed of many ethnic groups with the Han nationality as the main body. It has a large population and a vast land. It has long appeared in the world as a unified multi-ethnic country. It has the following main characteristics in terms of ethnic composition, resident distribution, and ethnic relations:
      (1) Of the 600 million people in the country, the Han nationality accounts for about 94%, and the more than 50 minority ethnic groups such as Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Manchu, Zhuang, Uyghur, Miao, Yi, Buyi, and Korean account for about 6% of the total population of the country; however, the areas where minority ethnic groups are distributed are vast, accounting for about 50% to 60% of the total area of the country. (2) The situation of ethnic groups living in mixed communities is particularly prominent. The vast majority of minority ethnic groups live together with the Han nationality in their own concentrated communities of varying sizes (some minority ethnic groups do not have concentrated communities), forming a pattern of large mixed communities and small concentrated communities with the Han nationality as the main body. Whether in economic, political, or cultural life, minority ethnic groups are closely linked with the Han nationality.
  (3) In the long historical development, economic ties and cultural exchanges have developed among all ethnic groups, and for a long time, a unified centralized state with the Han nationality as the main body including many minority ethnic groups has been formed. Although there were ethnic oppression and discrimination in this feudal centralized state, and there were wars among ethnic groups from time to time, the rulers of the Han nationality oppressed the minority ethnic groups, and the rulers of the minority ethnic groups also oppressed the Han nationality, the political, economic, and cultural ties between the ethnic groups and the friendship between the people of all ethnic groups still broke through various obstacles and continued to develop. This is the mainstream of ethnic relations in our history. (4) More than 100 years ago, imperialism invaded China and turned China into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. In the face of imperialist aggression, the survival of all ethnic groups in our country was seriously threatened without exception. Common destiny further linked all ethnic groups in our country together and carried out a long-term common revolutionary struggle against domestic and foreign enemies. In particular, the history of the Chinese revolutionary struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party in the past 30 years has closely united the people of all ethnic groups in our country, forming an inseparable flesh-and-blood relationship. (5) Due to historical development, the Han nationality in our country is not only the most populous and the main ethnic group in our country, but also its economic, political, and cultural development is generally ahead of that of other minority ethnic groups, playing an advanced leading role. (6) For a long time, imperialism has carried out various conspiracies, provoking the ties formed by all ethnic groups in our country in the long historical development, and instigating so-called "national independence" among some minority ethnic groups, attempting to achieve its goals of aggression and enslavement of the people of all ethnic groups in our country by means of "divide and rule."
    After the victory of the people's democratic revolution, the people of all ethnic groups in our country must further unite together in a unified (unitary) country, help each other and cooperate to jointly resist imperialist aggression externally and jointly build a socialist society internally. Ethnic regional autonomy represents the common interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and reflects the inevitable trend of historical development in our country, and is therefore warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups, especially the minority ethnic groups.
    Now our country has established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, 29 autonomous prefectures, and 54 autonomous counties. The task of establishing ethnic autonomous areas and establishing autonomous organs in the country has been basically completed by the Party and the state. Cadres of all minority ethnic groups have grown rapidly and in large numbers. By the end of 1958, there were 480,000 cadres of minority ethnic groups at the township level and above, which is more than 40 times the number of minority ethnic group cadres in 1949. In the autonomous organs of every minority ethnic group, there are a considerable number of cadres of minority ethnic groups, and many of them have assumed major leadership positions.
        Socialism is the Common Goal of the Struggle of All Ethnic Groups
    Socialism is the common goal of the struggle of all ethnic groups in our country, and it is also the only way for the development and prosperity of all ethnic groups in our country. Only socialism can bring high development and prosperity to all ethnic groups, and only socialism can fundamentally and thoroughly solve the ethnic issues in our country.
    In class society, ethnic issues are always related to class issues, and the essence of ethnic issues is class issues (of course, not entirely equal to class issues). The exploiting classes and exploitation systems based on private ownership of the means of production are the social roots that give rise to ethnic oppression, discrimination, and ethnic disputes. Only by carrying out thorough social revolution among all ethnic groups, completing democratic reform and socialist transformation, eliminating the exploiting classes and the system of private ownership of the means of production, and establishing a socialist system of public ownership of the means of production can the ethnic issues in our country be fundamentally solved. Marx and Engels said long ago in the Communist Manifesto: "As the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end." Lenin also once said: "It is impossible to eliminate national (and general political) oppression under the capitalist system. In order to eliminate this oppression, it is necessary to eliminate classes, that is, to implement socialism."
    All ethnic groups must carry out social reforms and take the road of socialism. This is certain and it is the universal law of social progress. In our country, social reforms in ethnic minority areas are divided into two stages: democratic reform and socialist transformation. The task of democratic reform is to implement land reform, abolish various oppressive and exploitative systems before capitalism, and the task of socialist transformation is to abolish the capitalist system of exploitation and change the individual private ownership of the means of production, and establish a socialist system of collective ownership and ownership by the whole people.
    Social reform is the business of the people of all ethnic groups themselves. Since the historical conditions of each ethnic group are different, the time and manner in which reforms are carried out must be determined in accordance with the development characteristics of each ethnic group and the wishes of the people of the ethnic group and public leaders who have ties with the people. That is to say, ethnic groups can reform sooner or later in terms of time, and the specific methods, steps, and speed of reform can also be different. Lenin said before the October Revolution: "All nations will arrive at socialism – this is inevitable, but all will do so in not exactly the same way, each will contribute something of its own to some form of democracy, to some variety of dictatorship of the proletariat, to the varying rate of socialist transformations in the different aspects of social life."
    Before the reforms, approximately 30 million people in minority ethnic areas in our country still maintained a feudal landlord economy. Some ethnic groups also had a certain degree of capitalist economic factors; this type of area included more than 30 minority ethnic groups such as Hui, Manchu, Zhuang, and Uyghur, and a large portion of the population of the Mongolian nationality, accounting for the vast majority of the minority ethnic population in our country. In addition, in areas inhabited by approximately 4 million people of the Tibetan nationality, Dai nationality, and other minority ethnic groups in our country, the serf system was still maintained; among the Yi nationality with a population of approximately 1 million in the Greater and Lesser Liangshan areas bordering Sichuan Province and Yunnan Province, the slave ownership system was still maintained; and in the ethnic areas of Lisu, Kawa, Jingpo, Dulong, Nu, and Bulang on the border of Yunnan, in the areas of Oroqen and Evenki people in Inner Mongolia, in the Hezhe nationality in Heilongjiang, and in a small part of the Li people in Hainan Island, there were still relatively strong remnants of the primitive commune system, and the level of production was very low. This type of ethnic area has a total population of approximately 600,000.
    The social, political, and economic situation in minority ethnic areas is very complicated. Not only are the stages of social development different among ethnic groups, but the socio-economic structure between different regions within some ethnic groups is also very different (for example, part of the Yi nationality is already in feudal society, but in the Greater and Lesser Liangshan areas, the slave ownership system is still maintained relatively completely). In areas inhabited by approximately 2.2 million people of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Kazakh nationalities, backward animal husbandry production is still carried out. Whether in terms of production or lifestyle, they are very different from agricultural areas. At the same time, religion has a wide and profound belief in minority ethnic groups. Many minority ethnic groups are almost entirely believers in Lamaism or Islam; the ethnic upper class and religious figures have a considerable influence in many minority ethnic groups. Due to the historical ethnic oppression and divisive policies of the reactionary ruling class, there are still varying degrees of estrangement between ethnic groups; there are also many contradictions and disputes between tribes and sects within many minority ethnic groups. Imperialists and domestic counter-revolutionary remnants have been using ethnic and religious relations to carry out various conspiracies to sabotage our country.
        The Guiding Principles for Carrying out Social Reform in Minority Ethnic Areas
    Based on the above-mentioned circumstances, the Party and the state have adopted a positive and prudent approach to social reform in minority ethnic areas of our country, adopting different methods, steps, and specific policies based on the different situations in each ethnic area. In the social reforms in various ethnic areas, the Party and the state have fully taken into account the characteristics of the ethnic groups and regions, conscientiously respected the wishes of the minority ethnic people, and fully consulted with public leaders in the minority ethnic groups who have ties with the people before making decisions. The social reforms in various minority ethnic areas have relied on the cadres and activists of the ethnic groups themselves to fully mobilize the people to carry them out. All Han Chinese Party members and cadres working in minority ethnic areas must, under the unified leadership of the local Party organization, adopt a positive attitude of assistance to the social reform of minority ethnic groups, but must never act as a substitute or impose orders.
    According to this guiding principle, the Party and the state have adopted different policies in the social reforms in minority ethnic pastoral areas than in agricultural areas. In the social revolution in agricultural areas, land reform is generally carried out first, distributing the land of feudal lords and slave owners to poor peasants who have no or little land, abolishing all the privileges and exploitation of feudal lords and slave owners, liberating the working people, and then, on the basis of the victory of land reform, carrying out the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, eliminating capitalist exploitation and the private ownership of the means of production, and establishing a socialist system of collective ownership and ownership by the whole people; while in the social reforms in minority ethnic pastoral areas, cattle and sheep are not distributed (that is, the livestock of the herders is not distributed to poor herders who have no or little livestock), but in the first step of their reform, namely democratic reform, feudal privileges and feudal exploitation are abolished, and a series of policies are implemented to protect and develop animal husbandry production, such as public ownership of pastures, free grazing, mutual benefit for both herders and herdsmen, and helping poor herders develop production. Then, on the basis of production development, socialist transformation is gradually carried out on herders and herdsmen through different methods, establishing a socialist system of collective ownership and ownership by the whole people. As for those minority ethnic areas where class differentiation is not obvious, the level of production is very low, and remnants of the primitive commune system are still maintained, the Party and the state have adopted measures to vigorously support them in developing production and culture, directly transition to socialist society through the road of cooperativization – combining socialist transformation with necessary social reforms (without carrying out systematic democratic reform movements), and help them gradually and directly transition to socialist society. In terms of reform methods, the Party and the state not only implemented peaceful transformation in the socialist transformation of all minority ethnic areas, just like in the Han Chinese areas, but also adopted peaceful methods in the democratic reforms in the pastoral areas of Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, the border areas of Yunnan, and the minority ethnic areas in Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces. That is, on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, the method of consultation with upper-class minority figures from top to bottom is adopted to carry out the reforms. As long as the upper-class minority figures agree to give up the oppression and exploitation of the working people and accept the reforms, the state will take appropriate measures to ensure that their political status and living standards are not reduced after the reforms, and at the same time, persuade the working people not to engage in fierce struggles against them during the reforms. For example, in the democratic reforms in Tibet, for all upper-class elements who did not participate in the rebellion and did not resist the reforms, their land and other means of production were not simply confiscated, but a redemption policy similar to that used for capitalists in the Han Chinese areas was adopted. Politically, their civil rights were not deprived, their representatives were properly arranged, and they were consulted to resolve issues related to the timing, steps, and specific policies of the reforms, and so on. Although the specific methods of peaceful reform vary from place to place, the essence is a kind of "redemption" of the upper-class minority figures in economic and political terms, a revolutionary and active policy. Peaceful reform is a bloodless revolution, a special form of class struggle under specific conditions.
    The reason why it is possible to complete democratic reform through peaceful methods in many minority ethnic areas in our country is mainly because the proletariat seized power throughout the country, established a powerful system of people's democratic dictatorship, and completed social reforms in areas with the vast majority of the population (mainly Han Chinese areas), and has the power to support minority ethnic areas. The broad united front established by our Party in minority ethnic groups, including upper-class minority figures, has created favorable conditions for us to carry out democratic reforms in minority ethnic areas through peaceful methods.
    For a long time, our Party has established a broad united front in minority ethnic groups based on the worker-peasant alliance, including uniting and transforming upper-class minority figures. The Party unites and cooperates with all those who have an anti-imperialist patriotic stance and are willing to cooperate with the Communist Party, and all those who support social reform. As long as they do not give up halfway, the Party will cooperate with them for a long time. With the help of this united front, we have consolidated and expanded the forces of anti-imperialism, patriotism, and support for democracy and socialism among all minority ethnic groups, attacked and isolated the reactionaries in all minority ethnic groups, and carried out work in minority ethnic areas relatively smoothly. The existence of this united front also makes it easier for us to educate upper-class minority figures and adopt peaceful and consultative methods to carry out reforms. However, it must be pointed out that whether peaceful reform can be smoothly realized does not depend entirely on the policies of our Party and government and the wishes of the minority ethnic working people, but also on the attitude of the upper-class exploiting figures in the minority ethnic groups towards reform. If they obey the will of the people and accept the Party's policies and guidelines, then peaceful reform can be realized; if they violate the will of the people, do not accept the Party's policies and guidelines, or even rise up in resistance, then peaceful reform cannot continue, and only by resolutely crushing their resistance can the realization of reform be guaranteed. At the same time, no matter which method is adopted (forceful or peaceful) to carry out reforms, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, and conscientiously implement the Party's class line to ensure the complete victory of the reforms. All of these have been proven by the experience of social reform in minority ethnic areas in our country.
    In many minority ethnic groups in our country, the upper religious figures and religious temples have various feudal privileges and feudal exploitation over the people, cruelly oppressing and harming the people, and seriously hindering the development and progress of all ethnic groups. For the feudal privileges and feudal exploitation of religious temples, the Party and the state have adopted a firm policy of abolishing them in the reforms. However, in the reforms, the Party and the state have always adopted a prudent attitude and a policy of differentiation towards issues related to minority ethnic religions. A strict distinction is made between the feudal privileges and feudal exploitation system of religious temples and the religious beliefs of the people, between the legitimate religious activities of religious practitioners and their illegal acts of extortion and abuse of religious followers, and between patriotic and law-abiding religious figures and counter-revolutionaries disguised as religious figures. On the one hand, the feudal oppression and exploitation system in religions is resolutely abolished, and counter-revolutionaries disguised as religious figures are suppressed. On the other hand, the religious freedom of the people is resolutely protected, religious relics are protected, and all patriotic and law-abiding religious figures are continued to be united. The legitimate religious activities of religious practitioners are not interfered with, and the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief is firmly implemented.
    Over the past decade, our Party and the state have led the people of minority ethnic groups in our country in extremely arduous and complex work of democratic reform and socialist transformation. Now, except for Tibet and some other areas with small populations where democratic reforms are still underway, all other ethnic areas have completed democratic reforms and basically realized the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, and carried out rectification movements and anti-rightist struggles in 1957 and 1958, achieving decisive victories in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. In this way, the vast majority of minority ethnic groups in our country have been liberated from the shackles of the original feudal system, slave system, and even primitive commune system, and established a socialist system, thereby opening up broad avenues for the development of all ethnic groups.
    In the second half of 1958, on the basis of the rapid development of the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, all minority ethnic areas that had completed democratic reforms and socialist transformation, like the Han Chinese areas, basically realized the people's commune system, and established large-scale people's communes combining industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and integrating government and commune. The people's commune is the basic organizational unit of our social structure. After its universal establishment throughout the country, it has shown well-known great advantages in promoting the rapid development of economic and cultural undertakings in ethnic areas of our country, and it has also demonstrated great advantages in promoting the unity, cooperation, and common development of all ethnic groups.
    Continue to Eliminate the Backwardness of All Ethnic Groups in Economic and Cultural Terms
    The completion of democratic reforms and the victory of the socialist revolution have opened up broad avenues for the prosperity and development of all ethnic groups in our country. However, the backward state of all ethnic groups in our country in terms of economy and culture left over from history, and the actual inequality between ethnic groups in economic and cultural terms resulting from this, cannot be eliminated immediately after the ownership of the means of production is changed. If the backward state of all ethnic groups in economic and cultural terms formed over a long period of history, and the actual inequality between ethnic groups in economic and cultural terms resulting from this, are not eliminated, it will be impossible to fundamentally and thoroughly solve the ethnic issues in our country.
    Due to various reasons formed by history – the small population of minority ethnic groups, the relatively backward economic and cultural development, the lack of or very few industrial workers, the lack of cadres and intellectuals, etc. – it is difficult for various minority ethnic groups in our country to rapidly change their economic and cultural backwardness solely by relying on their own strength, even after they have realized the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production. It is necessary to rely on the long-term and effective assistance of the state and advanced ethnic groups – mainly the Han Chinese – to solve this problem. Of course, in the cause of economic and cultural construction, the state's assistance to minority ethnic groups can only be gradual, planned, and within the state's capabilities, but the positive assistance is certain.
    After liberation, although our country was still in the situation of economic recovery, resisting the US and aiding Korea, and starting construction, it has given tremendous help to minority ethnic groups within the possible scope. This assistance is mainly manifested in the following aspects: (1) In planned economic and cultural construction, the state gives special consideration to minority ethnic areas in terms of basic construction investment based on the principle of "the whole country as a chessboard." Over the years, the growth rate of the state's basic construction investment in minority ethnic areas has always been higher than the average growth rate of the state's basic construction investment, so that the various construction undertakings in minority ethnic areas can develop at a higher average rate than the national average. (2) In terms of financial resources, the state provides huge financial subsidies to minority ethnic areas every year, issues various loans, relief funds, and production subsidies, sets up minority ethnic education subsidies, medical subsidies, and implements tax policies in the vast minority ethnic pastoral areas that are lighter than those in agricultural areas and cities. Tax exemptions are granted for a certain period of time in some minority ethnic areas where production development is particularly backward, and agricultural tools are distributed free of charge in some minority ethnic areas where production tools are particularly lacking and backward, and so on. At the same time, from the beginning of liberation, the Party and the state have paid great attention to carrying out trade work in minority ethnic areas, implementing reasonable price policies, rationally adjusting the price differences between industrial and agricultural products, increasing the income of minority ethnic people, and promoting the development of production in minority ethnic areas. (3) In terms of materials (including industrial and agricultural products, machinery and equipment, etc.), the state provides strong support to minority ethnic areas. Taking the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region as an example, in the few years from 1949 to 1957, the state transferred 2 million tons of materials from within the customs to Xinjiang, while only about 50,000 tons of materials were transferred from Xinjiang to within the customs. (4) The Party and the state send a large number of cadres (including technical cadres) to minority ethnic areas to participate in work, and plan to mobilize young people and workers in the interior to go to the border areas and minority ethnic areas to participate in construction. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in minority ethnic areas actively participate in local industrial and agricultural production and transportation and other construction undertakings. (5) Vigorously help minority ethnic groups develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings. In the past few years, the state has also helped more than a dozen minority ethnic groups without written languages, such as Zhuang, Buyi, Miao, Yi, and Lisu, to design and determine writing schemes.
            Profound Changes in Minority Ethnic Areas
    Due to the leadership and assistance of the Party and the state and the united and arduous efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in minority ethnic areas, the economic and cultural outlook of the minority ethnic areas in our country has undergone profound changes. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of all ethnic groups have been in high spirits, full of energy, and have launched a high tide of comprehensive great leap forward in socialist construction. The changes in the economic and cultural outlook of minority ethnic areas have been faster and greater. The actual inequality between ethnic groups in economic and cultural terms is gradually but rapidly being eliminated. If we compare 1957, the end of the first five-year plan, with 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, we can see that the grain output in minority ethnic areas has increased by more than 60%, and the industrial output value has increased by more than four times. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the grain output increased by 41% compared with 1957, and the industrial output value increased by 84% compared with 1957. The number of livestock in minority ethnic pastoral areas increased by more than double from 1949 to 1958. Many minority ethnic areas that had been short of grain for a long time have solved the grain problem and achieved self-sufficiency in grain with a surplus. The industry in many minority ethnic areas has gradually been established from scratch and from small to large. In some minority ethnic areas, large-scale modern industries have begun to be established, such as the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base in Inner Mongolia, the Karamay Oil Industrial Base in Xinjiang, and so on. The minority ethnic worker team had grown to more than 800,000 people by 1958. More than 2 million minority ethnic herders have shifted from nomadic to settled nomadism, and the transportation industry has also developed rapidly. The mileage of highways open to traffic in 1958 was more than 94,000 kilometers, an increase of more than seven times compared with 1949; the mileage of railways open to traffic has reached more than 6,300 kilometers, an increase of more than 80% compared with 1949; and air transportation routes have been opened in 17 important cities in four autonomous regions and in cities such as Xining and Yushu in Qinghai, Kunming and Baoshan in Yunnan, and Lhasa in Tibet.
    Commercial trade has also developed greatly. State-owned and cooperative commercial organizations have spread throughout minority ethnic areas. The high-interest exploitation of minority ethnic people by private merchants has become a thing of the past forever. On the basis of rapid production development, the material and cultural lives of minority ethnic people have greatly improved. The purchasing power of urban and rural areas in various ethnic autonomous areas has increased by one to several times. The total sales of state-owned and cooperative commercial businesses in minority ethnic areas across the country in 1958 increased by more than four and a half times compared with 1952. In terms of culture and education, in 1958, there were more than 4.65 million minority ethnic students in school across the country, accounting for more than 12% of the total minority ethnic population in the country; compared with 1948 before liberation, the number of primary school students increased by more than eight times, the number of middle school students increased by 110 times, and the number of college students increased by 35 times. Primary school education has been basically popularized in most ethnic autonomous areas. In the past, diseases were prevalent in minority ethnic areas, and the population of many ethnic groups was declining year by year. After liberation, the Party and the government made great efforts to change this situation. By 1958, various health and medical institutions had been widely established in minority ethnic areas across the country, including 750 hospitals, 25 sanatoriums, and 34,285 hospital beds, an increase of more than nine times compared with 1949 at the beginning of liberation. Due to the improvement of living standards and the development of medical, health, and health care undertakings, the population of minority ethnic groups has greatly increased. For example, the Mongolian population in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region increased by more than 300,000 people from 1947 when the autonomous region was established to 1958, equivalent to 36% of the original population. All of these show the superiority of our national system and social system, and show the greatness and correctness of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy.
    Lenin pointed out as early as 40 years ago that with the help of the proletariat in advanced countries and ethnic groups, backward countries and ethnic groups can avoid the stage of capitalist development and transition to socialism, and transition to communism after a certain stage of development. The fact that various minority ethnic groups in our country have developed by leaps and bounds after liberation with the help of the state and the Han Chinese people once again proves the wisdom and correctness of Lenin's theory.
    In the process of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the minority ethnic groups in our country must obtain the strong assistance of the Han Chinese in order to achieve rapid development and prosperity together with the Han Chinese. Similarly, the Han Chinese also need the help of the minority ethnic groups. On the road of common development of socialism, the assistance between various ethnic groups in our country is mutual and is also mutually needed. It is only because the Han Chinese have a particularly large population in our country, and the economic, political, and cultural development is generally ahead of that of various minority ethnic groups, playing an advanced leading role in national life, that it has a special responsibility to help the development of minority ethnic groups more.
    Our Party and the state have always opposed great Han chauvinism and local nationalism that are not conducive to national unity and ethnic solidarity, and have paid particular attention to overcoming the tendency of great Han chauvinism among Han Chinese cadres and people. In order to overcome the tendencies of great Han chauvinism and local nationalism, after liberation, the Party and the state conducted extensive and in-depth patriotic and socialist education for cadres and the masses of people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, and also conducted proletarian internationalism education; and twice inspected the implementation of the national policy nationwide in 1953 and 1956, focusing on criticizing the tendency of great Han chauvinism existing among Han Chinese cadres; and in the nationwide rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle that began in 1957, while continuing to overcome the tendency of great Han chauvinism, focused on criticizing the tendency of local nationalism, exposing and attacking a small handful of bourgeois nationalist elements who endangered national unity and ethnic solidarity. Deep socialist education was carried out for cadres and the masses of people of all ethnic groups, greatly raising the patriotic and socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses of people of all ethnic groups, and achieving a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in ethnic issues. Experience has proved that on ethnic issues, as on other social issues, it is not enough to thoroughly solve the problem with only socialist revolution on the economic front. It is also necessary to carry out a deep socialist revolution on the political and ideological front and thoroughly criticize and overcome various bourgeois nationalist ideas. Only by persistently struggling against various bourgeois nationalism or its remnants can we continuously consolidate the unity of our big family of ethnic groups in our country, develop the solidarity and cooperation among ethnic groups, and ensure the victorious development of socialist construction in our country.
    With the continuous victory of socialist revolution and socialist construction, socialist ethnic relations of great unity, great collaboration, common labor, and common development among ethnic groups have been universally established in all areas that have completed socialist transformation. In particular, the victory of the national rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle from 1957 to 1958, the comprehensive great leap forward in socialist construction and the people's commune movement since 1958, have further consolidated and developed the socialist ethnic relations in our country. All of these have made our big family of the People's Republic of China of freedom, equality, mutual assistance, and

    我国民族政策的伟大胜利
    民族事务委员会副主任　汪锋
    十年以前，中国各民族人民，在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，取得了人民民主革命的全国胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。
    中华人民共和国的成立，结束了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在我国的反动统治，废除了民族压迫制度，开辟了我国各民族平等团结、互助友爱、共同发展的社会主义新时代。
    从中华人民共和国成立之日起，我国进入了一个由资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。国家在过渡时期的总任务是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。根据这个总任务，中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府在国内民族问题方面的任务是：“巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，共同来建设祖国的大家庭；在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族一切权利方面的平等，实行民族区域自治，帮助少数民族进行社会改革，发展经济、政治和文化，逐步地消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使落后民族得以跻于先进民族的行列，共同过渡到社会主义社会。”这是一个伟大的历史任务。实现了这个任务，就可以使我国各民族不仅在政治上，而且在经济上和文化上达到完全的平等，就可以使我国各民族在高度发展和繁荣的基础上，进入人类历史上一个更高级的发展阶段——共产主义阶段，从而也就从根本上彻底地解决了我国的民族问题。
        我国处理国内民族关系的根本原则
    国家的统一、各民族间的平等团结、互助合作和共同发展，是我国处理国内民族关系的根本原则。毛泽东同志说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”
    民族平等是我们的国家统一和民族团结的政治基础，也是中国共产党在解决民族问题上所一贯遵循的基本原则。中华人民共和国宪法规定，我国公民不分民族、种族，一律都享有平等权利，禁止对任何民族的压迫和歧视。也就是说，在我国任何民族压迫和歧视的行为都是非法的。我国各民族无论大小，也不管他们还处在那个社会发展阶段上，都在国家生活和社会生活中享有完全平等的权利，都有获得充分发展的自由，都是我们国家的主人翁。十年来，我们的党和国家为了保障少数民族的平等权利和自治权利，贯彻实行民族平等团结政策，不但在全国范围内向各民族人民普遍地、深入地进行了关于民族平等、团结互助、友爱的宣传教育，并且先后颁布了一系列的法令和决定。同时，关于少数民族人民参加全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的选举，在我国的选举法中也作了专章的规定，对少数民族作了特殊的必要的照顾。使各少数民族都平等地参加了国家事务的管理和决定。为了贯彻执行民族平等团结政策，中央人民政府还先后派出了六个访问团，分赴西北、西南、中南、东北、内蒙古和西藏等全国各少数民族地区进行访问，传达中央人民政府和毛泽东主席对各少数民族的关怀和慰问。所有这些都对贯彻执行中国共产党的民族平等团结政策，加强我国各民族之间的团结和统一，起了十分重要的作用。
    民族区域自治是解决国内民族问题的基本政策
    民族的区域自治，是中国共产党解决我国民族问题的基本政策。
    中华人民共和国的宪法规定：“各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治。各民族自治地方都是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分。”根据宪法规定，各级民族自治地方（自治区、自治州、自治县）的自治机关在中央人民政府统一领导之下，除了行使一般地方国家机关的职权之外，还享有各项自治权利。
    民族区域自治的实质，就是要在统一的祖国大家庭内，使有着自己或大或小聚居区的（可以构成一级行政自治单位的）少数民族有当家作主管理本民族内部地方性事务的权利，保障少数民族的平等地位，充分发挥各少数民族参加国家政治生活和建设社会主义的积极性，不断增强各民族之间互相信任和友好合作。
    民族区域自治作为解决我国民族问题的基本政策，是以马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论原则为依据并结合我国民族的历史条件和现实情况决定的。
    列宁在论民族自决权问题的时候曾经说过：“马克思主义的绝对要求，就是在分析任何问题时都要把问题提到一定的历史范围之内，再则是讲到某一国家（例如，讲到该国的民族纲领），就要注意到同一历史时代以内该国与其他各国不同的具体特点。”“各个国家，因民族发展速度、居民民族成分、居民分布等等差异而各不相同。若不注意到所有这些一般历史条件和具体国家条件，就根本无法着手制定该国马克思主义者的民族纲领。”
    我国是一个以汉族为主体的由多民族结合而成的国家，拥有众多的人口和广大的土地，长期以来就以统一的多民族国家出现于世界。在民族成分、居民分布、民族关系等方面具有如下的主要特点：
      （一）在全国六亿几千万人口中，汉族人口约占94％，蒙、回、藏、满、僮、维吾尔、苗、彝、布依、朝鲜等五十多个少数民族的人口约占全国总人口的6％；但是少数民族分布的地区广大，约占全国总面积的50％到60％。（二）民族杂居的情况特别显著。绝大多数少数民族都以自己或大或小的聚居区（有些少数民族是没有聚居区的）和汉族交错居住在一起，形成了以汉族为主体的各民族大杂居、小聚居的局面，无论是在经济、政治或文化生活方面，少数民族都和汉族很密切地联结在一起。
  （三）在长期的历史发展中，各民族之间发展了经济联系和文化交流，并且很久以来，就形成以汉族为主体的包括许多少数民族在内的统一的中央集权制的国家。在这种封建集权制的国家内，虽然存在着民族压迫和歧视制度，各民族之间也不时有战争，汉族的统治者压迫过少数民族，少数民族的统治者也压迫过汉族，但是各民族之间的政治、经济和文化的联系以及各民族人民之间的友谊，仍然冲破了种种障碍，得到了不断的发展，这是我国历史上民族关系的主流。（四）一百多年以前，帝国主义侵入中国，变中国为半封建、半殖民地。在帝国主义侵略面前，我国各民族的生存，无例外地都受到了严重的威胁。共同的命运把我国各民族进一步联系起来，进行了长期的反对国内外敌人的共同的革命斗争。特别是近三十多年来中国共产党领导的中国革命斗争的历史，更把我国各民族人民紧密地结合在一起，成为一种血肉不可分离的关系。（五）由于历史的发展，汉族在我国各民族中不但人口最多，是我国的主体民族，而且经济、政治和文化的发展一般也走在各少数民族的前面，起着先进的主导的作用。（六）长期以来，帝国主义进行了种种阴谋活动，挑拨我国各民族在长久历史发展中所形成起来的联系，在一些少数民族中策动所谓“民族独立”，妄图以“分而治之”的办法来达到它侵略和奴役我国各民族人民的目的。
    我国各民族人民，在人民民主革命胜利之后，必须在一个统一的（单一制的）国家内，更进一步地团结起来，互助合作，才能对外共同抵御帝国主义侵略，对内共同建设社会主义社会。民族区域自治，正是代表了我国各民族人民的共同利益，反映了我国历史发展的必然趋势，因而受到了各民族人民特别是少数民族人民的热烈拥护。
    现在我国已经建立起了内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、广西僮族自治区、宁夏回族自治区、西藏自治区筹备委员会和二十九个自治州、五十四个自治县。党和国家在全国建立民族自治地方和设立自治机关的任务已经基本完成。各少数民族的干部已经迅速地大量地成长起来，到1958年底全国已经有了四十八万名乡以上的少数民族干部，这个数目相当于1949年少数民族干部的四十多倍。无论在那一个少数民族的自治机关中，都有了相当数量的少数民族干部，并且有许多人担任了主要的领导职务。
        社会主义是各族人民奋斗的共同目标
    社会主义是我国各民族人民奋斗的共同目标，也是我国各民族发展和繁荣的必经途径。只有社会主义才能给各民族带来高度发展和繁荣，也只有社会主义才能从根本上彻底地解决我国的民族问题。
    在阶级社会中，民族问题总是和阶级问题相联系的，民族问题的实质就是阶级问题（当然不完全是等于阶级问题）。建立在生产资料私有制基础上的剥削阶级和剥削制度，是产生民族压迫、歧视和民族纷争的社会根源。只有在各民族中彻底的进行社会革命，完成民主改革和社会主义的改造，消灭剥削阶级和生产资料私有的制度，建立起生产资料公有的社会主义制度，才能从根本上解决我国的民族问题。马克思和恩格斯在共产党宣言中早就说过：“人对人的剥削被消灭下去，民族对民族的剥削也就会同样被消灭下去。民族内部的阶级对抗一消失，民族间的敌视关系也就会跟着消失。”列宁也曾经说过：“在资本主义制度下决不能消灭民族的（和一般政治上的）压迫。为要消灭这种压迫，就必须消灭阶级，即实行社会主义。”
    各民族都必须进行社会改革，走社会主义的路，这是确定不移的，也是人类社会向前发展进步的普遍规律。在我国，各民族地区的社会改革分为民主改革和社会主义改造两个阶段。民主改革的任务是实行土地改革，废除资本主义以前的各种压迫、剥削制度；社会主义改造的任务是废除资本主义的剥削制度和改变生产资料的个体私有制度，建立社会主义的集体所有制和全民所有制。
    社会改革是各民族人民群众自己的事，由于各民族的历史条件不
  同，因而在什么时候进行改革以及如何进行改革，都必须依照各民族的发展特点，根据本民族的人民群众及与人民有联系的公众领袖的意愿去进行。也就是说，各民族在改革的时间上可以有先有后，在改革的具体方式、步骤、速度等等方面也可以有所不同。列宁在十月革命以前就曾经说过：“一切民族都将走到社会主义，这是不可避免的，但是一切民族的走法却不完全一样，在民主的这种或那种形式上，在无产阶级专政的这种或那种类型上，在社会生活各方面的社会主义改造的速度上，每个民族都会有自己的特点。”
    我国少数民族在改革以前，大约有近三千万人口的地区还保持着封建地主经济，其中有些民族并且有了一定程度的资本主义经济因素；这一类地区包括了回、满、僮、维吾尔等三十几个少数民族和蒙古族的一大部分人口，占我国少数民族人口的绝大多数。除此以外，在我国藏族，傣族和其他一些少数民族共约四百万人口的地区，还保持着农奴制度；在四川省和云南省交界的大、小凉山地区的大约一百万人口的彝族中，还保持着奴隶占有制度；而在云南边疆的傈僳、佧佤、景颇、独龙、怒、布朗等民族地区，在内蒙古的鄂伦春人和鄂温克人的地区，在黑龙江的赫哲族中，在海南岛的一小部分黎人中，则还存在着比较浓厚的原始公社制残余，生产水平十分低下，这一类民族地区共约六十万人口。
    少数民族地区的社会政治经济情况是很复杂的。不仅在各民族之间社会发展阶段不同，而且在一部分民族内部的不同地区之间的社会经济结构也很不相同（例如彝族一部分已处在封建社会，但是在大、小凉山地区却还保持着比较完整的奴隶占有制度），在蒙、藏、哈萨克等共约二百二十多万少数民族人口的地区，则还从事着落后的畜牧业生产，他们无论在生产或生活方式方面，都和农业区有很大的不同。同时，宗教在少数民族中有着广泛而深刻的信仰，许多少数民族几乎是全民信仰喇嘛教或伊斯兰教；民族上层和宗教人物在许多少数民族中有着相当大的影响。由于历史上反动统治阶级的民族压迫和挑拨离间政策，在各民族之间还存在着不同程度的隔阂；许多少数民族内部的部落之间和教派之间的矛盾、纠纷也很多。帝国主义和国内反革命残余分子，一直在利用民族和宗教的关系进行破坏我国的各种阴谋活动。
        在少数民族地区进行社会改革的方针
    基于上述种种情况，党和国家在我国少数民族地区的社会改革中，采取了积极而慎重的方针，分别根据各民族地区的不同情况，采取不同的方式、步骤和具体政策。在各民族地区的社会改革中，党和国家都充分地照顾了民族和地区的特点，认真地尊重了少数民族人民群众的意愿，充分地和少数民族中与群众有联系的公众领袖进行协商，然后再做出决定。各少数民族地区的社会改革，都依靠本民族的干部和积极分子充分发动人民群众去进行。在少数民族地区工作的所有汉族党员、干部，都必须在当地党组织的统一领导之下，对少数民族的社会改革，采取积极的帮助态度，但是绝不能包办代替或者是强迫命令。
    根据这个方针，党和国家在少数民族牧业区的社会改革中采取了和农业区不同的政策。在农业区的社会革命中，一般是先进行土地改革，分配封建主、奴隶主的土地给无地或少地的贫苦农民，废除封建主、奴隶主的一切特权和剥削，解放劳动人民，然后再在土地改革胜利的基础上进行生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，消灭资本主义剥削和生产资料的私有制，建立社会主义的集体所有制和全民所有制；而在少数民族牧业区社会改革中，则并不分配牛羊（即不是将牧主的牲畜分配给没有牲畜或很少牲畜的贫苦牧民），而是在其改革的第一步即民主改革中，废除封建特权和封建剥削，实行牧场公有、自由放牧、牧工牧主两利和帮助贫苦牧民发展生产等一系列的保护和发展畜牧业生产的政策，然后再在生产发展的基础上，逐步对牧主和牧民分别通过不同的方式实行社会主义改造，建立社会主义的集体所有制和全民所有制。至于在那些阶级分化尚不明显、生产水平十分低下，还保有原始公社制度残余的少数民族地区，党和国家则采取了大力扶助他们发展生产和文化，直接通过合作化的道路——结合社会主义改造进行必要的社会改革（不进行系统的民主改革运动），帮助他们逐步地直接地过渡到社会主义社会。在改革的方法上，党和国家不仅在一切少数民族地区的社会主义改造中，和汉族地区一样实行了和平改造，而且在新疆、西藏、内蒙古牧业区、云南边疆以及四川、甘肃、青海等省的少数民族地区的民主改革中，也采取了和平的方法。即在充分发动群众的基础上，采取自上而下和少数民族上层人士协商的办法来进行改革。只要少数民族上层人士同意放弃对劳动人民的压迫和剥削，接受改革，国家就采取适当办法，使他们在改革以后的政治地位和生活水平不致降低，同时说服劳动人民在改革中不对他们进行激烈的斗争。例如在西藏的民主改革中，对于一切没有参加叛乱和不抗拒改革的上层分子的土地及其他生产资料，就不是采取简单没收的办法，而是采取了和对待汉族地区资本家差不多的赎买政策，并且在政治上不剥夺他们的公民权利，适当安排他们的代表人物，和他们协商解决有关改革的时间、步骤以及各项具体政策，等等。各地在和平改革中的具体办法虽然不完全一样，但是实质上都是对少数民族上层阶级在经济上和政治上的一种“赎买”，是一种革命的积极的政策。和平改革，是一种不流血的革命，是一种在特定条件下阶级斗争的特殊形式。
    采取和平的方法完成民主改革在我国许多少数民族地区之所以可能，这主要是因为无产阶级在全国夺取了政权，建立了强大的人民民主专政的制度，并且在全国绝大多数人口的地区（主要是汉族地区）已经完成了社会改革，有力量来支援少数民族地区。我们党在少数民族中建立的包括少数民族上层人士在内的广泛统一战线，对我们在少数民族地区采取和平方法进行民主改革造成了有利条件。
    长期以来，我们的党就在少数民族中建立了以工农联盟为基础的包括团结、改造少数民族上层人士在内的广泛的统一战线。一切具有反帝爱国立场、愿意和共产党合作的人，一切赞成社会改革的人，党都和他们团结合作。只要他们不半途而废，党就和他们实行长期的合作。借助于这个统一战线，我们在各少数民族中巩固和扩大了反帝爱国以及赞成民主和社会主义的力量，打击和孤立了各少数民族中的反动派，比较顺利地开展了少数民族地区的工作。由于这个统一战线的存在，也便于我们对少数民族上层分子进行教育，采取和平协商的方法来进行改革。但是，必须指出，和平改革之能否顺利地实现，并不完全取决于我们党和政府的政策以及少数民族劳动人民的愿望，还要看少数民族中的剥削阶级上层分子对改革所持的态度。如果他们顺从人民意志，接受党的方针、政策，那么和平改革就能够实现；如果他们违反人民意志，不接受党的方针、政策，甚至起而反抗，那么和平改革就不能继续，只有坚决地粉碎他们的反抗，才能保证改革的实现。同时，不论采取哪一种方式（强力的或者是和平的）来进行改革，都必须充分地发动群众和依靠群众，认真地贯彻实行党的阶级路线，才能保证改革的彻底胜利。所有这些都是我国少数民族地区社会改革的经验所证明了的。
    在我国许多少数民族中，宗教上层和宗教寺庙对人民群众具有种种封建特权和封建剥削，残酷地压迫和残害人民，严重地阻碍着各民族的发展进步。对于宗教寺庙的封建特权和封建剥削，党和国家在改革中采取了坚决废除的方针。但是党和国家在改革中，对有关少数民族宗教方面的问题，始终采取了慎重的态度和区别对待的政策。严格地把宗教寺庙的封建特权、封建剥削制度和人们的宗教信仰问题加以区别，把宗教职业者的正当宗教活动和他们对教徒群众的勒索、虐害等非法行为加以区别，把爱国守法的宗教界人士和披着宗教外衣的反革命分子加以区别。一方面坚决地废除宗教中的封建压迫剥削制度，镇压披着宗教外衣的反革命分子，一方面坚决保护人民的宗教信仰自由，保护宗教文物，继续团结宗教界一切爱国守法的人士，不干涉宗教职业者的正当宗教活动，坚持贯彻党的宗教信仰自由政策。
    十年来，我们的党和国家领导我国少数民族人民进行了极为艰巨复杂的民主改革和社会主义改造工作。现在，全国少数民族中，除了西藏和其他一些人口很少的地区还正在进行民主改革以外，其他各民族地区都已经完成了民主改革和基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，并且在1957年和1958年进行了整风运动和反右派斗争，取得了政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的决定性胜利。这样，就使我国绝大多数的少数民族从原来的封建制度、奴隶制度以至原始公社制度的束缚下解放出来，建立了社会主义制度，从而为各民族的发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    1958年下半年，在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业迅速发展的基础上，在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，所有完成了民主改革和社会主义改造的少数民族地区，又都和汉族地区一道，基本上实现了人民公社化，建立了大规模的、工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社。人民公社是我国社会结构的基层组织单位。它在全国各地普遍建立以后，在促进我国各民族地区经济、文化事业的迅速发展方面显示了众所周知的巨大优越性，而且在促进各民族的团结合作和共同发展方面也表现了极大的优越性。
    继续消灭各民族在经济文化方面的落后状态
    民主改革的完成和社会主义革命的胜利，为我国各民族的繁荣发展开辟了广阔的道路。但是历史上遗留下来的我国各民族在经济、文化上的落后状态以及由此而产生的各民族间在经济、文化上的实际不平等，却不是生产资料所有制一改变，就可以立刻消灭的。而不消灭历史上长期形成的各民族在经济、文化方面的落后状态，以及由此而产生的各民族在经济上、文化上的实际不平等，也就不可能从根本上彻底地解决我国的民族问题。
    由于历史形成的种种原因——少数民族人口少，经济、文化发展比较落后，没有或很少有产业工人，干部和知识分子缺乏等等……，我国各少数民族即使在实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造之后，也很难单单依靠本身的力量，迅速地改变自己的经济和文化的落后面貌。必须依靠国家和先进民族——主要是汉族的长期而有效的帮助，才能解决这个问题。当然，在经济和文化建设事业中，国家对少数民族的帮助，只能是逐步的、有计划的和国家力量之所能及的，但是积极帮助这一点则是确定无疑的。
    解放以后，我们的国家虽然还处在经济恢复、抗美援朝和开始建设的情况之下，但是在可能的范围内已经给了少数民族以巨大的帮助。这种帮助主要地表现在下列几个方面：（一）国家在有计划的经济和文化的建设中，根据“全国一盘棋”的原则，在基本建设投资方面给予少数民族地区以特别照顾，历年来国家对少数民族地区的基本建设投资的增长速度总是高出于全国基本建设投资的平均增长速度，从而使少数民族地区的各项建设事业能够以高出于全国的平均速度向前发展。（二）在财力方面，国家每年都给予少数民族地方以巨额的财政补助，发放各种贷款、救济款和生产补助费，设置少数民族教育事业补助费、医疗补助费，并且在广大的少数民族牧业区实行轻于农业区和城市的税收政策，在一部分生产发展特别落后的少数民族地区于一定时间内免去税收，在一部分生产工具特别缺乏和落后的少数民族地区无偿地发放农具，等等。同时，从解放一开始，党和国家就以极大的注意力在少数民族地区开展贸易工作，实行合理的价格政策，合理调整工、农业产品之间的差价，增加少数民族人民的收入，促进少数民族地区生产的发展。（三）在物资方面（包括工、农业产品、机器设备等等）国家给予少数民族地区以大力的支援。以新疆维吾尔自治区为例，在从1949年到1957年的几年中，国家从关内调往新疆的物资达二百万吨，由新疆调往关内的物资仅五万吨左右。（四）党和国家派遣大批干部（包括技术干部）到少数民族地区参加工作，有计划地动员内地青年和工人前往边疆和少数民族地区参加建设，驻在少数民族地区的人民解放军部队积极参加当地的工、农业生产和交通运输等各项建设事业。（五）大力帮助少数民族发展文化教育卫生事业。过去几年中，国家还帮助僮、布依、苗、彝、傈僳等十多个没有文字的少数民族设计和确定了文字方案。
            少数民族地区的深刻变化
    由于党和国家的领导帮助和少数民族地区各民族人民团结一致的艰苦努力，我国各少数民族地区的经济和文化的面貌已经起了深刻的变化。特别是从1958年以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，各民族人民意气风发，干劲冲天，掀起了社会主义建设全面大跃进的高潮，少数民族地区经济和文化面貌的变化更快、更大。各民族在经济上、文化上的实际不平等，正在逐步地但是迅速地趋于消灭。如果拿第一个五年计划末的1957年和中华人民共和国成立时的1949年相比，那么就可以看见，少数民族地区的粮食产量增加了60％以上，工业产值增长了四倍多。而在大跃进的1958年，粮食产量又比1957年增加了41％，工业产值比1957年增加了84％。少数民族牧业区的牲畜头数从1949年到1958年总共增加了一倍以上。许多长期缺粮的少数民族地区都已经解决了粮食问题，做到了粮食自给而有余；许多少数民族地区的工业都已由无到有，由小到大地逐步建立起来，在一部分少数民族地区并且开始建立起了大规模的现代化工业，例如内蒙古的包头钢铁工业基地，新疆的克拉玛依石油工业基地，等等。少数民族的工人队伍在1958年已经发展到八十多万人。二百多万的少数民族牧民已经由游牧走向定居游牧，交通运输事业也发展很快，公路的通车里程在1958年是九万四千多公里，比1949年增加了七倍多；铁路的通车里程已达六千三百多公里，比1949年增加了80％以上；并且在四个自治区的十七个重要城市和青海的西宁、玉树，云南的昆明、保山和西藏的拉萨等城市开辟了航空运输线路。
    商业贸易也有极大的发展，国营的和合作社营的商业机构已经遍布全国各少数民族地区，私商对少数民族人民的高利盘剥，已经永远成为过去。在生产迅速发展的基础上，少数民族人民的物质生活和文化生活都有了很大的改善。各民族自治地方的城乡购买力已提高了一倍至数倍，全国少数民族地区国营、合作社营商业的销售总额，1958年比1952年增加了四倍半以上。在文化教育方面，1958年全国少数民族在校学生共计四百六十五万多人，约占全国少数民族总人口的12％以上；和解放前的1948年比较，小学生增加了八倍多，中学生增加了一百一十倍，高等学校学生增加了三十五倍，大部分民族自治地方都已经基本上普及了小学教育。少数民族地区过去是疾病流行，许多民族的人口在逐年下降。解放以后，党和政府用了很大的努力来改变这种状况。到1958年全国少数民族地区已经广泛地建立起了各种卫生和医疗的机构，其中有医院七百五十座，疗养院二十五座，设有病床三万四千二百八十五张，比解放初的1949年增加了九倍多。由于生活的改善和医疗、卫生、保健事业的开展，少数民族的人口已经有了很大的增长。例如内蒙古自治区的蒙古族人口从自治区成立的1947年到1958年增加了三十多万人，相当于原有人口的36％。所有这些，都说明了我们的国家制度和社会制度的优越性，说明了中国共产党的民族政策的伟大和正确。
    列宁早在四十年以前就曾经指出，在先进的国家和民族的无产阶级的帮助之下，落后的国家和民族可以避免资本主义的发展阶段，过渡到社会主义，并且经过一定的发展阶段过渡的共产主义。我国各少数民族解放以后在国家和汉族人民的帮助之下飞跃发展的事实，再一次证明了列宁这个论断的英明和正确。
    在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的过程中，我国各少数民族必须取得汉族的大力帮助，才能和汉族一起得到迅速的发展和繁荣，同样汉族也很需要少数民族的帮助。在共同发展的社会主义道路上，我国各民族之间的帮助是相互的，也是共同需要的。只是因为汉族在我国人口特别众多，并且经济、政治、文化的发展一般走在各少数民族的前面，在国家生活中起着先进的主导的作用，所以他负有更多地帮助少数民族发展的特殊的责任。
    我们的党和国家一贯反对不利于国家统一和民族团结的大民族主义和地方民族主义，特别是注意在汉族干部和人民中克服大汉族主义倾向。为了克服大汉族主义和地方民族主义倾向，解放以后党和国家曾经在全国范围内对各民族干部和人民群众进行了广泛的深入的爱国主义和社会主义教育，同时进行了无产阶级国际主义的教育；并且曾经在1953年和1956年两次对全国民族政策的执行情况进行了检查，着重地批判了存在于汉族干部中的大汉族主义倾向；又在1957年开始的全民整风运动和反右派斗争中，于继续克服大汉族主义倾向的同时，着重地批判了地方民族主义倾向，揭露和打击了一小撮危害国家统一和民族团结的资产阶级民族主义分子。对各民族干部和人民群众进行了深刻的社会主义教育，大大地提高了各民族干部和人民群众的爱国主义和社会主义觉悟，在民族问题方面取得了政治思想战线上社会主义革命的决定性胜利。经验证明，在民族问题上和在其他方面的社会问题上一样，要彻底地解决问题，单有经济战线上的社会主义革命是不够的，还必须在政治思想战线上进行深刻的社会主义革命，彻底地批判和克服各种资产阶级民族主义的思想。只有坚持不懈地和各种资产阶级民族主义或其残余思想进行斗争，才能不断地巩固我国各民族大家庭的统一和发展各民族间的团结合作，保障我国社会主义建设事业的胜利发展。
    随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的不断胜利，各民族之间的大团结、大协作、共同劳动、共同发展的社会主义民族关系，已经在一切完成了社会主义改造的地区普遍地确立起来。特别是1957到1958年的全民整风运动和反右派斗争的胜利，1958年以来的社会主义建设全面大跃进和人民公社化运动，更使我国社会主义的民族关系得到了进一步的巩固和发展。所有这些，就使我们在十年以前建立起来的各民族自由、平等、互助、友爱的中华人民共和国大家庭，在社会主义的基础上钢铁一般地巩固起来了。任何国内外反动势力妄图破坏我们伟大祖国社会主义事业的一切阴谋诡计，都会在我国各民族人民坚强无比的团结力量面前被碰得粉碎。
        继续巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结
    现在，摆在我国各民族人民面前的任务是：根据党的社会主义建设总路线，通过人民公社这种社会组织形式，高速度地发展社会生产力，争取在十五年、二十年或者更长一点的时间内，把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。在这个期间，党和国家在国内民族问题方面的任务，就是要继续向各民族人民进行爱国主义和社会主义教育，不断地巩固祖国的统一和发展各民族间的团结合作，在帮助少数民族继续完成民主改革和社会主义改造、巩固和发展人民公社的同时，积极开展技术革命和文化革命，尽可能地加速社会主义建设，使各少数民族都能够赶上或者接近汉民族的发展水平，共同建成社会主义社会。
    目前，全国各民族人民正为中共八届八中全会的伟大号召所鼓舞，在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央领导下，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜，同心同德，团结一致，反右倾，鼓干劲，展开轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，为实现今年的国民经济计划，为提前三年在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而英勇奋斗。
    中国共产党是我国各民族人民革命胜利的鼓舞者和组织者，是我国各民族的领导核心。毛泽东同志是我国各民族人民久经考验的伟大领袖。只有在中国共产党的领导下，按照毛泽东同志所指出的道路前进，才能使我国各族人民获得民族的和社会的彻底解放。
    为了加强党对少数民族人民的领导，必须继续加强党在各少数民族地区的组织建设和思想建设，不断地巩固和加强少数民族地区各级党组织在政治上、思想上的团结和统一，防止和克服资产阶级民族主义思想对党的侵入和腐蚀。“党的团结和统一，是党的生命，是党的力量所在。经常注意维护党的团结，巩固党的统一，是每一个党员的神圣职责”。（中国共产党党章）。各少数民族地区的党组织，只有当它能够抵抗住任何资产阶级民族主义的侵袭时，才能够成为坚强的战斗的组织。
    十年来，共产党在少数民族地区的建设，已经取得了伟大的成绩。现在全国已经有了五十万以上的少数民族共产党员，九十万以上的少数民族共青团员，一般少数民族地区，都普遍地建立了党和团的基层组织。各民族的党员和团员，都在当地党组织的统一领导之下，密切地联系群众，无论在阶级斗争和生产斗争中，都站在群众的最前列，起了骨干和带头的作用。特别是经过整风运动和反右派斗争，严肃地批判了地方民族主义倾向之后，各民族的党、团员和干部的共产主义觉悟大大提高了，成为进一步发展各民族地区社会主义事业的不可战胜的力量。
    我们有中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导，有全国各民族人民的伟大团结，我们的事业就一定能够胜利。
