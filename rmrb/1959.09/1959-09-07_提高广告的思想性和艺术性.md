    Enhance the Ideological and Artistic Qualities of Advertising

    Commercial advertising includes more than a dozen types such as: printed advertisements, shop windows, physical display advertisements, film and slide advertisements, signboards and road signs.

    Commercial advertising has different properties under different social systems. Commercial advertising in capitalist societies serves the purpose of making capitalists rich. Its characteristics are exaggeration, deception, and it often uses stimulating and erotic forms to attract the masses. Commercial advertising in socialist society serves production, consumers, expanding commodity circulation, and reflecting the country's production level. Therefore, it must not only regularly introduce commodities to the people and guide people's consumption, but also undertake the task of expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, promoting commodity production, and organizing the people's economic life. Commercial advertising is also an art form in the socialist cultural field. Commercial advertisements that are rich in ideological and artistic qualities also play a role in beautifying the city, streets, shops, and enriching the people's cultural life.

    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, China's commercial advertising has made great achievements, promoted the excellent traditions of our national forms, and also created some new forms and methods, basically overcoming the remnants of capitalist advertising and formalism, and has also cooperated with previous political movements to carry out propaganda and mobilization.

    With the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production and the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural life, society's requirements for commercial advertising are also increasing. Therefore, we must further improve commercial advertising work. First of all, we must strengthen the ideological and political nature of commercial advertising, so that commodity promotion and political propaganda can be better combined. As long as we use our brains more, many commodities can find appropriate ways to combine commodity promotion and political propaganda based on the Party's policies and central tasks in each period. For example, a window display in Shanghai's No. 1 Department Store promoting the latest radio, uses a dove of peace flying in a clear sky and radio waves to display the sound of peace, with the image of American warmongers holding their ears and shivering in fear as the background, which not only reflects the country's radio production level, but also reflects the strength of peace. Another window display promoting various musical instruments, uses the first line of the score of the song "Socialism is Good" as the background, which not only promotes the goods, but also reflects the superiority of the socialist system. At present, overcoming right-leaning sentiments and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy is the central task of the people across the country, and commercial advertising can also be used to carry out publicity activities around this center.

    Various forms of commercial advertising must not only have ideological content, but also strive to achieve a clear theme, proper layout, harmonious colors, a national style that the masses love to see, and meet the requirements of socialist realism. That is to say, we should constantly enrich and develop the artistry of commercial advertising according to the development of the country's production technology level, the improvement of the people's material and cultural level, and changes in customs and living characteristics. The display of goods inside the store should also be arranged neatly and beautifully, not only making it convenient for the masses to purchase goods, but also giving the masses a bright and cheerful feeling; the form of product manuals and advertisements in newspapers, magazines, and product packaging should also be as beautiful as possible under the principle of economy. The ideological nature, political nature, authenticity, and artistry of commercial advertising are unified. A commodity advertisement that lacks artistry cannot attract people to look at it, and therefore cannot achieve the intended publicity purpose.

    Commercial advertising is a specialized business. In order to continuously improve the ideological, political, authentic, and artistic level of commercial advertising, employees engaged in commercial advertising should continuously improve their political and professional level. The Commercial Advertising Experience Exchange Conference recently held by the Ministry of Commerce in Shanghai is a good learning opportunity. Everyone should study hard and give full play to more creativity based on the specific conditions of their region, unit, and commodity characteristics to make our commercial advertising rich and colorful.

### 提高广告的思想性和艺术性

    提高广告的思想性和艺术性
    商业广告包括有：印刷品广告、商店橱窗、实物陈列广告、电影和幻灯片广告、招牌和路牌广告等十几种类型。
    商业广告在不同的会社制度下具有不同的性质。资本主义社会的商业广告是为资本家发财服务
  的，特点是夸大、欺骗，并常常以刺激、色情的形式来吸引群众。社会主义社会商业广告是为生产、为消费者、为扩大商品流通、为反映国家生产水平服务的。因此，它不仅要经常向人民群众介绍商品，指导人民消费，而且还担负着扩大城乡物资交流，促进商品生产，组织人民经济生活的任务。商业广告又是社会主义文化领域内的一种美术形式，富于思想性和艺术性的商业广告，还起着美化市容、街道、商店和丰富人民文化生活的作用。
    解放以来，我国商业广告在党的领导下，取得了很大成绩，发扬了我国民族形式的优良传统，也创造了一些新的形式和方法，基本上克服了资本主义广告的残余和形式主义，并且配合历次政治运动，进行了宣传鼓动。
    随着工农业生产的不断发展，人民物质文化生活的逐步提高，社会对商业广告的要求也越来越高。因此，必须进一步做好商业广告工作。首先必须加强商业广告的思想性、政策性，使商品宣传和政治宣传更好地结合起来。很多商品只要根据党的每个时期的方针、政策和中心工作，多动脑筋，是能够找到商品宣传和政治宣传适当结合的形式的。如上海第一百货商店一个宣传最新收音机的橱窗，以晴空万里飞翔的和平鸽与电波显示着和平巨音，以美国战争贩子握着两只耳朵吓得哆嗦的形象为背景，既体现了国家收音机的生产水平，又反映了和平力量的强大；另一个宣传各种乐器的橱窗，以“社会主义好”歌曲开头一句的谱曲为背景，既宣传了商品，又体现了社会主义制度的优越性。目前克服右倾情绪、厉行增产节约，是全国人民的中心任务，商业广告也可以围绕这个中心来进行宣传活动。
    各种形式的商业广告既要有思想内容、又应力求做到主题明确，布局得当，颜色调和，具有群众喜闻乐见的民族风格，合乎社会主义现实主义的要求。也就是说，我们应当根据国家生产技术水平的发展，人民物质文化水平的提高和风俗习惯、生活特点的改变，不断丰富和发展商业广告的艺术性。商店内部的商品陈列也应该陈列得整齐、美观，不仅使群众购货方便，还要给群众以明朗畅快的感觉；商品说明书和报刊、商品包装上的广告的形式，也应在经济的原则下，尽可能做到美观。商业广告的思想性、政策性、真实性、艺术性是统一的。一个缺乏艺术性的商品广告，不能吸引人去看，也就不能达到应有的宣传目的。
    商业广告是一种专门的业务，为了使商业广告不断提高思想性、政策性、真实性、艺术性的水平，从事商业广告的职工应该不断提高政治思想和业务水平。最近商业部在上海召开的商业广告经验交流会，就是一个很好的学习机会。大家应该很好学习，并根据自己所在的地区、单位的具体条件和商品特点，发挥更多的创造性，使我们的商业广告丰富多彩。
