Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The Japan Federation of Economic Organizations' Defense Production Committee and the Missile Council have decided to accept the suggestion of Mr. Schaff, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense who visited Japan not long ago, to cooperate with the United States in jointly producing various types of missiles.

According to today's "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," these two groups, composed of Japanese monopoly capitalists and closely related to the "Defense Agency," have decided to first manufacture "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles. Then, they will also produce "Nike-Ajax," "Bomarc," and "Hawk" surface-to-air missiles, as well as "Falcon" and "Sparrow" air-to-air missiles. They will also dispatch a "Rocket Industry Survey Group" to the United States at the end of the year for observation.

    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本经营者团体联合会防卫生产委员会和导弹协议会决定接受不久以前访问日本的美国助理国防部长帮办夏夫的建议，同美国合作共同生产各种导弹。
    据“日本经济新闻”今天报道，这两个由日本垄断资本家组成的、同“防卫厅”有密切关系的团体决定首先制造“响尾蛇”式空对空导弹，然后还要生产“奈克—阿贾克斯”、“鲍马克”、“鹰式”地对空导弹和“法尔空”以及“麻雀”式空对空导弹，并且将在年底派遣一个“火箭产业调查团”到美国去考察。
