    The Great Leap Forward High Tide of Chinese Comrades
    By Daoerji, Reporter of the Mongolian News Agency

    We are extremely happy to have the opportunity to visit our great neighbor, the People's Republic of China. We have been very interested in the achievements and prosperous development of the People's Republic of China through newspapers and radio broadcasts. In our work, we often learn from our close friends engaged in the socialist construction of our motherland. When I thought about seeing with my own eyes their great achievements and happy scenes in socialist construction, I was very happy.

    Thirty-eight years ago, it took several months to go to Beijing from "Da Kulun" (the old name of Ulaanbaatar). Now, we take the train for two days and nights to enter the vast territory of great China. "Motherland, goodbye!" These words seemed to be still on our lips, and the enthusiastic Chinese people were already greeting us and wishing us a safe journey. On the way to Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, we saw farmers working against the clock in the boundless golden fields. Whether in cities or villages, we can see hardworking workers, who are building production and cultural buildings for the people's needs, one after another.

    We arrived in Beijing and came to Tiananmen Square in the capital. The tall Tiananmen Gate Tower stands majestically. Ten years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, announced the freedom and independence of the Chinese people here.

    In the northwestern suburbs of Beijing, we visited the Ming Tombs Reservoir, built by the wisdom and hands of hundreds of thousands of working people. The dam of the Ming Tombs Reservoir is a beautiful building half a kilometer long. The reservoir has hydroelectric power stations, gymnasiums, and equipment for irrigating farmland and scientific research. These were built by voluntary labor in a short period of time on the basis of the high consciousness of the working people. This is an outstanding labor achievement that will never be forgotten by future generations. Such a miracle has never occurred in any capitalist country.

    When we visited Qingdao, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jinan and other cities of the People's Republic of China, we met workers and farmers in the thriving industrial and agricultural production sectors, as well as people from cultural circles. Everywhere we went, everyone we met was very enthusiastic to us. They introduced us without reservation to the leap forward achievements made under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and warmly extended their greetings to the Mongolian people. All of these clearly show how consolidated and deep the fraternal friendship between our two peoples is. When visiting the Shanghai United Meat Processing Plant, Director Wang of the plant warmly received us. In the conversation, the director said that we friends who are heading towards the same goal can only create a great cause of peace by learning from each other. In the past, this factory could only process meat, but now even the smallest parts are not wasted, but are highly utilized to produce high-quality products such as medicines for treating various diseases, sanitary products, delicious foods, and various chemical fertilizers to meet the needs of the people. Another moving event in this factory is that everyone actively participates in the creative innovation movement in order to develop national production. Here is just one example: in the past, hog bristles were scraped by hand, and five or six hogs could be scraped per hour. During the Great Leap Forward, advanced workers created innovations and manufactured sophisticated electric machines that could scrape more than 500 hogs per hour. There are many such patriotic suggestions in this factory. There are thousands of such leap forward factories in our friendly People's Republic of China. When we see these wonderful achievements, and then think that the workers in many factories in our country are also putting forward thousands of new suggestions like our Chinese friends in order to accelerate the development of our country, we feel excited.

    As the basic pillar of developing socialist agriculture, the people's commune has made a great leap forward in its own development. A people's commune led by Gu Shaosheng in the suburbs of Shanghai was initially composed of several townships and residential areas. The Communist Party and the People's Government gave strong support to it, creating favorable conditions for its forward development. Now, this commune has trucks and tractors, and cultivates thousands of acres of land. It produces a lot of grain and also raises a large number of cattle, pigs and chickens. It is a large commune engaged in the production of food, chemicals, agricultural tools, repairs and other diversified side businesses. This commune has public canteens, shops, nurseries, hospitals, bathhouses, cultural palaces, etc. to serve the working people. All of this shows that a real leap forward has occurred in agricultural production. It can be seen that the vast number of farmers who fully understand the great significance of the people's commune are full of confidence in their future.

    In the cities and villages of our close and friendly China, sparks of labor are shining everywhere, and the sun of a happy life is shining high in the sky. Let us once again extend our heartfelt congratulations to our Chinese brothers who have the same goals as us and have made great achievements in the Great Leap Forward, and wish you greater achievements in a greater leap forward!

    中国同志的跃进高潮
    蒙古通讯社记者　道尔吉
    我们能够有机会到我们伟大邻邦中华人民共和国访问，感到无比高兴。因为我们通过书报和广播看到和听到中华人民共和国的成就和繁荣发展，很感兴趣。我们在工作中也经常向从事祖国社会主义建设的亲密友人学习，当我想到就要亲眼看到他们在社会主义建设事业中取得的巨大成就和幸福景象时，心中十分高兴。
    三十八年前由“大库伦”（乌兰巴托旧名）去北京需要几个月的时间，现在我们乘火车经过两昼夜的奔驰，便进入伟大中国的辽阔国土。“祖国，再见！”这句话似乎还在口边，热情的中国人民已经在向我们问候一路平安了，中国美丽的大自然也微笑着接待客人。我们在去中华人民共和国首都——北京的途中，看见农民们分秒必争地在无边无际的金黄色的田野上忙碌着。不论在城市和乡村，都可以看到勤劳的工人们，就是他们把人民需用的生产及文化建筑，一幢幢地盖起来。
    我们到了北京市，来到首都的天安门广场。高大的天安门城楼巍然地屹立着。十年前，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席在这里宣布中国人民自由独立。
    在北京市的西北郊，我们访问了用成千上万的劳动人民的智慧和双手建造起来的十三陵水库。十三陵水库的水坝是长达半公里的美丽建筑物，水库有水电站、体育馆以及灌溉农田的设备和科学研究设备等，这些都是在劳动人民高度觉悟的基础上，在很短的时期内义务劳动建成的。这是世世代代永不忘记的卓越的劳动成果，这种奇迹是任何资本主义国家不曾出现过的。
    我们在访问中华人民共和国的青岛、上海、杭州、济南等城市时，会见了繁荣发展的工业和农业生产部门的工人和农民以及文化界人士，我们每到一处，遇到的每一个人对我们都非常热情，他们毫不保留地向我们介绍了在共产党和人民政府的英明领导下取得的跃进成果，并热情地向蒙古人民致意。所有这些都明显地表明我们两国人民的兄弟友谊是多么巩固和深厚。参观上海市肉品联合加工厂时，这个工厂的王厂长热情地接待了我们。厂长在谈话中表示，我们走向同一目标的朋友们，只有互相学习，才能创造和平的伟大事业。这个工厂过去只能加工肉食，而现在连一点细小的部分都不废掉，被高度地利用起来，生产出医治各种疾病的药品、卫生用品、美味食品以及各种化学肥料等优质产品，供应人民群众需要。这个厂的另一个动人的事件，就是每个人都为了发展国家的生产，积极参加创造革新运动。这里仅仅举一例子：以前用手刮猪毛，每小时刮五、六口猪，跃进时期，先进工人创造革新，制造了精细的电力机，每小时能刮五百多口猪，这样的爱国主义的建议在这个工厂是很多的。像这样跃进的工厂，在我们友好的中华人民共和国数以千计，我们看到这些美好的成就，再联想到在我们的祖国很多工厂的工人，也像中国朋友一样，为了加快祖国发展而提出数以千计的新建议时，感到兴奋。
    作为发展社会主义农业的基本支柱的人民公社，在自己的发展中有了巨大跃进，上海市郊由顾少生领导的一个人民公社，初办时由几个乡、居民区组成，共产党和人民政府就给予了大力支持，为它的向前发展创造了有利条件。现在，这个公社有了载重汽车、拖拉机并耕种着几千亩土地，粮食产量很多，还饲养着大量的牛、猪和鸡，这是一个从事食品、化学、农具、修理等多项副业生产的大型公社。这个公社有为劳动人民服务的公共食堂、商店、托儿所、医院、浴室、文化宫等，这一切都表明，在农业生产中出现了真正的跃进。可以看出，充分认识了人民公社巨大意义的广大农民，对自己的前途充满着信心。
    在我们亲密友好的中国的城市和乡村，到处都闪烁着劳动的火花，幸福生活的太阳在高空照耀着，让我们再一次向和我们有同一目标，在跃进中取得巨大成就的中国兄弟们表示衷心的祝贺，祝你们在更大的跃进中取得更大的成就！
