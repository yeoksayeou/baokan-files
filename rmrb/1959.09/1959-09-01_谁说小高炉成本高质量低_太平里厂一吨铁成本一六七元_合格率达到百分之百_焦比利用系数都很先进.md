Who Says Small Blast Furnaces Are Expensive and Low Quality?
    Taipingli Factory's Cost Per Ton of Iron is 167 Yuan
    Qualified Rate Reaches 100 Percent; Coke Ratio and Utilization Coefficient Are Very Advanced

    (Our newspaper, Changsha, 31st dispatch) Can steel production achieve simultaneous leaps forward in high yield, high quality, and low cost? The fact that the utilization coefficient of the Taipingli Iron Factory in Xinhua, Hunan, is high, the quality is high, the coke ratio is low, and the cost is low provides an affirmative answer.
    In the vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, this iron factory saw a new situation of "everyone engaging in increasing production, everyone managing economy, output rising daily, and costs falling monthly." The blast furnace utilization coefficient increased from 0.6 to 0.94. In mid-August, the utilization coefficient of blast furnace No. 1 reached 1.2. The qualified rate of pig iron reached 100%, of which 94% was high-silicon, low-sulfur foundry pig iron. Coke consumption was greatly reduced, from the original consumption of 1.1 tons per ton of iron to 0.914 tons. The cost per ton of pig iron was reduced from more than 200 yuan to 167 yuan, reversing the loss-making situation. Since the second quarter, it has made a profit of more than 440,000 yuan.
    The Taipingli Iron Factory is a new factory born in the Great Leap Forward last year. The factory has two small 27-cubic-meter blast furnaces, three short 2.9-cubic-meter blast furnaces, and 2,086 employees. The fuel comes from five areas in Shaodong County, more than 130 kilometers away, and is transported to the factory by automobile and waterway. The transportation cost is very high, equal to more than one-half of the price of the coke itself. The iron ore is also 16 kilometers away from the factory, 40% transported by automobile and 60% by manual labor (flatbed trucks). The transportation cost is also high, equivalent to three to four times the cost of the iron ore itself. Under such production conditions, this factory has been able to rapidly reduce the cost of pig iron while increasing the output and quality of iron, mainly because all employees in the factory have established an economic accounting perspective and strengthened cost management and the management of raw materials, and labor in the process of fighting against right-leaning conservative thinking.
    In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of all employees in the factory to participate in cost management, the factory changed the original first-level accounting to three-level accounting at the factory, workshop, and team levels. Because the three-level management was implemented, the daily production situation was mastered by the workers, thus inspiring the workers to participate in cost management and further establish an economic accounting perspective. The sand casting workshop strengthened economic accounting, and quickly reduced the scrap rate from 50% to 15%, and the cost per ton of castings was reduced from 630 yuan to 360 yuan. In terms of capital management, corresponding measures were also taken to ensure that every yuan of working capital could play its due role.
    While strengthening financial cost management, the factory also mobilized the masses to strengthen the management of raw materials and fuel, and tried every means to reduce the consumption quota of raw materials and fuel. In terms of the management of raw materials and fuel, coke is stored in sheds to prevent rain from wetting it. At the same time, the factory improves the operation technology of crushed coke to reduce pulverized coke and ensure that the particle size meets the standards, and all pulverized coke is used to burn boilers. In terms of ore, the factory promotes the sintering of powder ore into the furnace, ensuring that not a single bit is lost. In terms of reducing coke consumption, the factory adopts the method of multi-nozzle segmented rapid combustion to increase the hot blast temperature, so that the wind temperature is often maintained above 600 degrees. At the same time, the speed of the blower is increased from 560 revolutions per minute to 620 revolutions per minute, and the air volume is increased from 80 cubic meters per minute to 100 cubic meters per minute to strengthen the smelting intensity.
    Fully tapping labor potential, strengthening labor management, and improving labor productivity are also important aspects of this factory's cost reduction. In terms of labor use, the factory conducted a thorough survey and ranking of all labor, and made reasonable arrangements according to technical skills and physical strength, allocated labor according to production tasks, and determined labor quotas. And try to compress non-production personnel as much as possible. In the past, the transportation team had poor labor management and serious idleness and waste. After the factory party committee took measures to rectify the organization and strengthen ideological education, it implemented tools to people and tasks to people. As a result, the attendance rate increased from 59% to 95%, and the number of personnel was reduced from 720 to 320, but the daily transportation volume increased from more than 80 tons to more than 120 tons. Through the adjustment of labor organization, the attendance rate of the mining area increased from 80% to 98%, and the cost per ton of ore decreased from 7.41 yuan to 5.53 yuan. After adopting these methods, the factory's labor productivity increased by 52.9% compared with the past.
    The employees of the Taipingli Iron Factory have established a good atmosphere of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. Now, whether they are furnace operators or top furnace operators, whether they are transport workers or crushing workers, they always care about output, quality, and their own economic benefits as soon as they go to work. In order to reduce coke consumption, the top furnace workers take the initiative to cooperate with the crushing workers to screen all the coke below 8 mm that was discarded in the warehouse in the past, and use all the coke above 5 mm, so that the coke charging rate increases from 70% to 85%. These have played a considerable role in reducing costs.

    谁说小高炉成本高质量低
    太平里厂一吨铁成本一六七元
    合格率达到百分之百  焦比利用系数都很先进
    本报长沙31日电　钢铁生产能不能做到高产、优质、低成本三者同时跃进？湖南新化太平里铁厂利用系数高、质量高、焦比低、成本低的事实作出了肯定的回答。
    这个铁厂在轰轰烈烈的厉行增产节约的群众运动中，出现了“人人搞增产，个个管节约，产量日日升，成本月月降”的新局面。高炉利用系数由零点六提高到零点九四，8月中旬一号高炉的利用系数达到一点二。生铁合格率达到100％，其中94％是高矽低硫的铸造生铁。焦炭消耗量大大降低，由原来炼一吨铁消耗一点一吨下降到零点九一四吨，每吨生铁的成本由二百多元降低到一百六十七元，扭转了亏本现象，二季度以来，共盈利四十四万多元。
    太平里铁厂是在去年大跃进中诞生的一个新厂。全厂有二十七立方米的小高炉二座，二点九立方米的矮高炉三座，职工二千零八十六人。燃料来自一百三十多公里以外的邵东县五个地区，经汽车、水运到厂，运输费用很高，等于每吨焦炭本身价格的二分之一强。铁矿石离厂也有十六公里，40％由汽车运输，60％靠人力（板车）搬运。运输成本也高，相当于铁矿石本身成本的三至四倍。在这样的生产条件下，这个厂能够在提高铁的产量和质量的同时，使生铁成本也迅速下降，主要是由于全厂职工在和右倾保守思想进行斗争的过程中，树立了经济核算观点，加强了成本管理和原料材料、劳动力的管理。
    为了调动全厂职工参加成本管理的积极性，这个厂将原来的一级核算，改为厂、车间、班组三级核算。由于实行了三级管理，每日的生产情况为工人所掌握，因而激发了工人参加成本管理的积极性，进一步树立了经济核算观点。翻砂车间加强了经济核算，很快使废品率由50％降低到15％，每吨铸件的成本就由六百三十元降低到三百六十元。在资金管理方面，也采取了相应的措施，使每一元流动资金都能发挥应有的效用。
    在加强财务成本管理的同时，这个厂还发动群众，加强了原料和燃料的管理，千方百计降低原料和燃料的消耗定额。在原料和燃料的管理方面，焦炭入棚，不受雨水淋湿，同时提高碎焦操作技术，减少粉焦，保证粒度符合标准，并且把粉焦也全部用来烧锅炉。矿砂方面，推行粉矿烧结入炉，做到点滴不丢，在降低焦炭消耗量方面采用多咀分段快速燃烧的办法提高热风温度，使风温经常保持在六百度以上，同时将鼓风机的转速由每分钟五百六十转增加到六百二十转，风量由每分钟八十立方米加大到一百立方米，以加强冶炼强度。
    充分挖掘劳动潜力，加强劳动管理，提高劳动生产率，也是这个厂降低成本的一个重要方面。在劳力使用上，厂里将全部劳动力进行了一次摸底排队，根据技术、体力强弱进行合理安排，按生产任务分配劳力，确定劳动定额。并尽量压缩非生产人员。运输队过去劳动管理不善，窝工浪费现象严重，厂党委采取措施整顿组织，加强思想教育以后，实行工具到人，任务到人，结果出勤率由59％提高到95％，人员由七百二十人压缩到三百二十人，每天的运输量却由八十多吨上升到一百二十多吨。采矿工区通过劳动组织的调整，出勤率由80％提高到98％，每吨矿砂的成本由七元四角一分下降到五元五角三分。采用这些办法以后，全厂劳动生产率比过去提高了52.9％。
    太平里铁厂的职工们已经树立了勤俭办企业的良好风气。现在不管是炉前工或炉顶工，也不管是运输工或碎料工，他们一上班总要关心产量、质量，关心自己的经济效果。炉顶工为了降低焦炭损耗，主动地配合碎料工，把过去抛弃在仓库里不用的八公厘以下的焦炭，统统过筛，把五公厘以上的都用起来，使焦炭入炉率由70％提高到85％。这些，对于降低成本都起了不小的作用。　	廖道维
