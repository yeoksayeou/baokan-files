Xinhua News Agency, September 10th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons publicly stated on the 9th that the United States intends to use the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to militarily intervene in the Laotian civil war.

In a broadcast to the nation, Parsons said that if Laos issued an "appeal" to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, "the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries could take action according to the provisions of their charter." In response to a reporter's question about "whether the United States might send troops to Laos," Parsons implied that the United States might directly militarily intervene in Laos when "the situation requires."

In recent days, some major American newspapers and members of Congress have also been clamoring and advocating that the U.S. government take action to interfere in the Laotian situation.

Xinhua News Agency, September 10th dispatch from Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat announced today that Thailand will send a military delegation to Laos. He said that the delegation, which will depart for Laos next week, will include representatives from the three branches of the Thai armed forces. This delegation will go as close as possible to the combat areas of the Laotian civil war. Sarit Thanarat revealed that he had held talks with Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Secretary-General Pote Sarasin and U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Johnson on the Laotian situation on the 9th.

Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Thanom Kittikachorn revealed today that Thailand will send its troops to militarily intervene in the Laotian situation when the Phoui Sananikone government makes a request to Thailand through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Xinhua News Agency, September 10th dispatch from New York, TASS: According to a "New York Times" reporter's dispatch from Bangkok, Thailand has placed its troops on the Laotian border on alert. It also said that Thailand will send its troops into Laos once it receives a request from the Royal Lao Government.

Xinhua News Agency, September 10th dispatch from New York, TASS: The U.S. "Newsweek" reported that South Vietnamese "President" Ngo Dinh Diem may have expressed willingness to send his troops to Laos.

The magazine wrote: "You wouldn't be surprised if you saw American-trained South Vietnamese troops taking action in Laos."
