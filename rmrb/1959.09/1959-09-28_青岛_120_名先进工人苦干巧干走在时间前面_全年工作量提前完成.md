Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, September 27th: One hundred and twenty workers in Qingdao City have stepped into 1960 ahead of schedule, with the fastest having already done the work for September of next year.

These people who are ahead of time pay special attention to combining hard work with skillful work, and vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution. Li Jianguo, Wang Yunqing, and Chen Baohe from the Qingdao Foundry Machinery Factory initially only focused on hard work, and their efficiency was not high. Later, with the help of the Party organization, they used their brains and vigorously innovated technology, which increased their work efficiency several times. For example, when making the iron plates for the five-ton crane, Li Jianguo improved the powerful offset tool, reducing the time to produce one iron plate from forty minutes to ten minutes. From January to August, the three of them put forward a total of eighty-four innovation proposals. According to the plan, they were to complete six thousand five hundred and forty man-hours of work for the whole year, but by early September they had already completed nine thousand nine hundred and eight man-hours.

Advanced workers leading the backward, backward workers catching up with the advanced, mutual cooperation, and leaping forward together are the common characteristics of these workers. Ma Xueshun, an advanced producer in the tool workshop of the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, took the initiative to work with Zong Chuanfang and Sha Shunzeng on the previous two shifts to jointly study and improve technology. As a result, all three of them continuously broke the target of one thousand man-hours. After Liu Gangting, a lathe worker at the Qianjin Factory, reached one thousand man-hours, he actively helped Yan Shouyi and Zhang Baokuan in the opposite shift to improve their tools, so that all the workers working on this lathe achieved one thousand man-hours.

    青岛120名先进工人苦干巧干走在时间前面
    全年工作量提前完成
    新华社青岛27日电  青岛市有一百二十名工人提前跨进了1960年，其中最快的已做明年9月份的活。
    这些走在时间前面的人，都特别注意苦干和巧干相结合，大闹技术革新和技术革命。青岛铸造机械厂李建国、王云庆、陈宝和三人，开始只注意苦干，效率不高。后来他们在党组织的帮助下，开动脑筋，大力革新技术，使工作效率提高了好几倍。如做五吨吊车的铁板时，李建国改进强力偏刀，使铁板由过去四十分钟生产一块降为十分钟生产一块。1至8月份，他们三个人共提出八十四项革新建议，按照计划，他们全年要做六千五百四十五台时的工作，到9月上旬就已完成九千九百零八台时。
    先进带动后进，后进猛赶先进，互相协作，一齐跃进是这些工人的共同特点。四方机车车辆厂工具车间先进生产者马学顺，主动和上两班的宗传芳、沙舜增共同研究改进技术，结果三个人都连续突破了千台时的指标。前进工厂车工刘刚亭达到千台时后，积极帮助对班阎守义、张宝宽改进刀具，使在这个机床上工作的工人全部达到千台时。
