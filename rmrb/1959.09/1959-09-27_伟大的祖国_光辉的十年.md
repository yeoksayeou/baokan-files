    Great Motherland, Glorious Ten Years
    Ji Fang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party
    This year's National Day is the tenth anniversary of the liberation of our great motherland. On this great festival, we feel extremely excited and inspired.
    October 1st is an epoch-making day in our country's history. The Chinese people, who had suffered deeply, stood up from then on, and Chinese history has since opened a new chapter. Now, ten years have passed, and in just ten years, the liberated Chinese people have shown the world their great spirit, infinite wisdom, and creative power, writing a brilliant and magnificent new historical chapter. The victory of the Chinese revolution is another major event of world historical significance after the Soviet Union's great October Revolution, proving that Marxism-Leninism is a universally applicable truth. At the same time, it points out the correct path to liberation for all oppressed countries and peoples. Ten years of history have told the Chinese people that only the great Communist Party is the true savior of the Chinese people and the core force leading the Chinese people from victory to victory.
    In the past ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the heroic Chinese people have created such magnificent and amazing miracles. Through a series of revolutionary movements such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, a prerequisite for moving towards socialism was created. Under the beacon of the Party's timely proposed general line for the transition period, we braved the wind and waves, setting off a vigorous upsurge in socialist transformation and socialist construction, changing the private ownership of the means of production, overfulfilling the glorious task of the First Five-Year Plan, laying the foundation for the country's socialist industrialization, and achieving a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front through the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle. In 1958, the beginning year of the Second Five-Year Plan, the people of the whole country held high the glorious banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and a new situation of galloping horses, majestic momentum, and high spirits emerged in the cause of socialist construction. We have clearly seen that the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the concentrated expression of the Chinese people's enthusiasm and determination to build socialism, and are the product of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's creative application of Marxism-Leninism in China. Because of this, we were able to achieve unprecedented great achievements in industry, agriculture, and other fronts last year and in the first half of this year, and make it possible for the Second Five-Year Plan to be basically completed two years ahead of schedule. It is also because of this that honest people all over the world are watching the new China with admiration, celebrating our victory with us, while imperialism and all reactionaries have to tremble in the face of the great achievements of the new China. In the past ten years, especially in the year or so of the Great Leap Forward, our motherland has undergone tremendous changes. What our ancestors did not dare to dream of has now become a living reality. Every Chinese person, as long as they think about the past, look at the present, and look forward to the future, cannot help but feel excited and feel how lucky and glorious it is to be a Chinese person in the Mao Zedong era!
    The great victory of the Party's leadership is also manifested in the Party's consistent policy of uniting, educating, and reforming the bourgeois intellectuals. Since liberation, the Party has been extremely concerned about intellectuals, made appropriate arrangements in their work, given them strong support and encouragement, allowed them to fully exert their knowledge and technology, and continuously carried out education, assistance, and training in political thought. At the same time, the care and consideration in life are also meticulous. It should be said that only the great Communist Party would value and cherish intellectuals like this, and only in the liberated New China can intellectuals have such a bright and broad future. In the ten years since liberation, under the leadership, education, and assistance of the Party, after a series of revolutionary movements, especially after the rectification and anti-Rightist movement, bourgeois intellectuals have undergone significant changes in all aspects. Not only have they made certain contributions to the socialist cause in their work, but they have also taken a big step forward in political thought. Obviously, this is a great happy event for bourgeois intellectuals and a great victory for the Party's policy. As a bourgeois intellectual and as a political organization of bourgeois intellectuals, it is so fortunate and encouraging to encounter such a great and bright era! Here, looking back at the predecessor of our organization before liberation—the Chinese Revolutionary Party and the Provisional Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang—after the failure of the Chinese Revolution in 1927, at that time, starting from the standpoint and viewpoint of the bourgeoisie, we also wanted to adhere to the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, continue the historical task of the national revolution that Mr. Sun Yat-sen had not completed, and establish a commoner regime to achieve "socialism." However, due to the limitations of the class, it was all wishful thinking. We did not even follow Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies and the will that the Chinese Revolution must "take Russia as its teacher." Therefore, no matter how resolutely we opposed the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek group at that time, even if Mr. Deng Yanda, who led the organization at that time, sacrificed himself, our organization and the vast majority of its members were still swaying left and right, falling into the quagmire of the middle route, and accomplishing nothing. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the call of the Chinese Communist Party's united front policy, we began to gradually approach the Communist Party and received the Communist Party's continuous guidance and assistance. However, until the early days of liberation, we were still an organization with complex components and politically very unstable. After liberation, due to being directly under the leadership, education, and assistance of the Communist Party, and through a series of revolutionary movements, our organization gradually became pure, the political consciousness of its members gradually improved, and we began to truly embark on the road to a new life. However, after the high tide of the socialist revolution arrived, because the bourgeois nature was fundamentally incompatible with socialism, the Rightist group headed by Zhang Bojun ungratefully used the legal organization of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party and launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification, causing the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party to once again lose its political direction and become a tool against the Party and against socialism. It was at such a critical moment that the great Communist Party promptly led the people of the whole country to launch a vigorous struggle against the Rightists, completely defeating the Rightists' frenzied attack, and achieving a great victory on the political and ideological front by continuing the rectification throughout the country. In this great victory, the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party was rescued, its political direction was corrected, its organization was further strengthened, and the political consciousness of its members was unprecedentedly improved. They realized that their bourgeois nature not only needed to continue to undergo fundamental transformation in political stance, but that only by following the Communist Party and taking the road of socialism was their only direction and future. From the long history of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party's political swaying and repetition, we can see that if democratic parties leave the Communist Party, leave the Communist Party's leadership and education, they will not only accomplish nothing, but will inevitably be submerged by the historical trend. Only by resolutely following the Communist Party and sincerely accepting the Communist Party's leadership and education can they be reborn and rescued, and have a broad and bright future. This point, especially in the ten years since liberation, our understanding is even deeper and more personal. Therefore, when we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country on the basis of the victory of rectification and anti-Rightism, we cannot help but feel extremely grateful and encouraged.
    Although the appearance of democratic parties and bourgeois intellectuals has undergone significant changes in the past ten years, we must never forget that, due to the deep influence of past class society on the majority of people, their political and ideological state has not yet basically shaken off the middle state, and the two-sidedness still exists. Therefore, how to continue to implement the policy of combining service and transformation under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is still the most serious task of bourgeois intellectuals, especially our democratic party members. Now, as we warmly celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country together with the people of the whole country, we see that the achievements of the motherland in the past ten years are brilliant and splendid, and we see the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune waving in the wind. This is a great encouragement to us and the most powerful spur. We, the members of the democratic parties, must be determined to resolutely work hard under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, oppose Rightism, boost our energy, increase production and practice thrift, and strive with practical actions to complete the great task of our motherland's socialist construction and thoroughly transform ourselves in service.
    It has been exactly ten years since the liberation of the motherland. These great and glorious ten years are inseparable from the names of the great Chinese Communist Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong. Let us shout:
    Long live the great People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great and glorious Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the most beloved and great leader of all ethnic groups in our country!

    伟大的祖国　光辉的十年
    中国农工民主党主席团主席　季方
    今年国庆节，是我们伟大祖国解放的十周年。在这伟大的节日，我们感到无比的振奋和激动。
    十月一日，这是我国历史上划时代的日子，灾难深重的中国人民从此站了起来，中国历史从此揭开了新的一页。如今，十年过去了，仅仅十年，解放了的中国人民就向全世界表明了自己伟大的气魄、无穷的智慧和创造力量，写出了多么灿烂辉煌的新史章。中国革命的胜利，是继苏联伟大的十月革命之后又一次具有世界历史意义的重大事件，证明了马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的真理，同时也给一切被压迫的国家和人民指出了获得解放的正确道路。十年历史告诉了中国人民，只有伟大的共产党，才是中国人民真正的救星，是领导中国人民从胜利走向胜利的核心力量。
    十年来，英勇的中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，创造了多么宏伟的惊人的奇迹。通过土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、“三反”、“五反”等一系列的革命运动，为迈向社会主义创造了前提。在党及时提出的过渡时期总路线的灯塔照耀下，乘风破浪，掀起了轰轰烈烈的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的高潮，改变了生产资料的私有制，超额完成了第一个五年计划的光荣任务，奠定了国家社会主义工业化的基础，并且经过整风运动和反右派斗争，在政治思想战线上取得社会主义革命的伟大胜利。在1958年第二个五年计划开始的年头，全国人民高高地举起了党的社会主义建设的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜，在社会主义建设事业中出现了万马奔腾，气势磅礴，意气风发的新局面。我们已经很清楚地看到，总路线、大跃进、人民公社，是中国人民建设社会主义热情和决心的集中表现，是伟大的中国共产党和毛主席在中国创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的产物。正因为如此，我们才能在去年和今年上半年的工业、农业以及其他各个战线上取得了史无前例的伟大成绩，并使第二个五年计划可能提前在两年内基本完成。也正因为如此，全世界正直人民正以爱慕的心情注视着新中国，同我们一道欢庆着我们的胜利，而帝国主义和一切反动派，却只好在新中国伟大成就的面前胆战心惊。十年来，特别是在大跃进的一年多以来，我们的祖国已经发生了巨大的变化，我们祖先连梦想也不敢梦想的，而现在已经成为活生生的现实了。每个中国人只要想想过去，看看现在，再望望将来，都不禁心情激动地感到，作为一个毛泽东时代的中国人，是多么幸运、多么光荣啊！
    党的领导的伟大胜利，同样表现在党对资产阶级知识分子一贯所采取的团结教育和改造的政策上。解放以来，党对知识分子备极关怀，在工作上作了适当的安排，给予了大力的支持与鼓励，让他们有充分发挥自己知识技术的机会，在政治思想上也不断地进行了教育、帮助和培养，同时在生活上的关怀与照顾，也是无微不至的。应该说，只有伟大的共产党，才会对知识分子这样的重视和爱护，只有在解放了的新中国，知识分子才有如此光明广阔的前途。解放十年来，资产阶级知识分子在党的领导、教育和帮助下，经过一系列的革命运动，特别是经过整风反右运动以后，各方面都有了显著的变化，不仅在工作上为社会主义事业作出了一定的贡献，而且在政治思想上也向前大大地跨进了一步。显然，这是资产阶级知识分子的大喜事，也是党的政策的伟大胜利。作为一个资产阶级知识分子，作为一个资产阶级知识分子的政治组织，幸逢这样一个伟大光明的时代，这是多么值得庆幸和鼓舞的事情！ 在这里，回顾解放以前我们组织的前身——中华革命党和中国国民党临时行动委员会，在1927年中国大革命失败以后，当时从资产阶级的立场观点出发，也曾想坚持反帝反封建的旗帜，继孙中山先生所未完成的国民革命的历史任务，以建立平民政权，实现“社会主义”为目标，然而由于阶级的局限性，实际上都是空想，甚至连孙中山的三大政策和“中国革命必须“以俄为师”的遗嘱都没有遵循。所以，尽管当时对蒋介石集团的反动统治无论怎样坚决反对，甚至当时领导这个组织的邓演达先生自己竟以身殉，但是我们的组织和绝大部分成员却始终是左右摇摆，陷入了中间路线的泥坑，一事无成。到抗日战争以后，在中国共产党的统一战线政策的感召下，才开始逐步地靠近共产党，并得到共产党的不断指导和帮助，可是一直到解放初期，我们还是一个组织上成分复杂，政治上很不坚定的组织。解放以后，由于直接在共产党的领导、教育和帮助下，通过一系列的革命运动，才使我们的组织逐步地纯洁，成员的政治觉悟逐步提高，开始真正走向新生的道路。然而在社会主义革命高潮到来以后，由于资产阶级的本性和社会主义是根本相违背的，以章伯钧为首的右派集团竟忘恩负义地利用农工民主党的合法组织，乘共产党整风的机会向党向社会主义展开了猖狂进攻，使农工民主党又一度迷失了政治方向，而成为反党反社会主义的工具。正在这样一个危急关头，伟大的共产党及时地领导着全国人民开展了轰轰烈烈的反击右派的斗争，彻底击溃了右派的猖狂进攻，并通过在全国范围内继续整风，取得了政治思想战线上的伟大胜利。在这个伟大的胜利中，农工民主党才得到了挽救，端正了政治方向，进一步健全了组织，成员的政治觉悟也获得了空前提高，认识到自己的资产阶级本质，不但需要继续进行政治立场的根本改造，而且只有跟着共产党走社会主义的道路，才是自己唯一的方向和前途。从农工民主党的漫长的政治上摇摆反复的历史中可以看到，民主党派离开了共产党，离开了共产党的领导和教育，不仅一事无成，而且必将为历史的潮流所淹没，只有坚决跟着共产党，真诚接受共产党的领导和教育，它才能得到新生和挽救，才有宽广光明的前途。这一点，特别在解放十年以来，我们的体会是更加深刻而亲切的。所以，当我们在整风反右取得胜利的基础上来欢庆建国十周年时，更不由得令人万分的感激和鼓舞。
    十年来，民主党派和资产阶级知识分子的面貌虽然有了显著的变化，但我们决不应忘记，多数人由于过去阶级社会的影响太深，到目前为止政治思想上基本上还没有摆脱中间状态，两面性依然存在。因此，如何在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，继续贯彻服务与改造相结合的方针，还是资产阶级知识分子，特别是我们民主党派成员当前最严重的任务。现在，当我们和全国人民一起热烈欢庆建国十周年的时候，我们看到十年来祖国的成就光辉灿烂，看到总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜迎风招展，这是对我们极大的鼓舞，也是最有力的鞭策。我们民主党派成员，只有下定决心，坚决地在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜下，反右倾，鼓干劲，增产节约，以实际行动为完成我们祖国社会主义建设的伟大任务和在服务中彻底进行自我改造而奋斗。
    祖国解放整整十年了，这伟大光辉的十年，是和伟大的中国共产党和我们敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席的名字分不开的。让我们高呼：
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    我们全国各族人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
