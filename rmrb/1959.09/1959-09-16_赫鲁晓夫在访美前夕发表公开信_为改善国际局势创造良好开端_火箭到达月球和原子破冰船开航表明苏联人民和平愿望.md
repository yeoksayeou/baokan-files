Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: TASS Moscow reported: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, published an open letter on the 14th, responding to letters and telegrams he received due to his visit to the United States. The full text is as follows:

Due to my upcoming visit to the United States, I have received letters and telegrams from Soviet citizens as well as citizens of other countries, including Americans. These letters and telegrams express the hope that my visit will be conducive to improving mutual relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and that the exchange of views with U.S. President Eisenhower will create a good start for improving the international situation.

Now, mankind is in a wonderful era. It is an era of scientific, technological, economic, and cultural prosperity, an era in which fairy tales are becoming reality. Our visit to the United States coincides with two extremely significant events: the Soviet people's launch of a cosmic rocket from Earth that successfully flew to the moon for the first time in history, and the maiden voyage of the world's first atomic icebreaker, the "Lenin."

How many fantasy novels, fairy tales, and poems have been written about flying to the moon! For generations, people have dreamed of interstellar travel, and now we are stepping through the door to realize this bold dream. For decades, scientists have strived to build a ship capable of directly navigating the Arctic, and that ship has been built.

Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers calculated and implemented with precision the extraordinary flight of the rocket along the route from Earth to the Moon. How can we, Soviet people—not only we Soviet people, but all kind-hearted people—not be encouraged and celebrate this great achievement! Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers built the world's first atomic icebreaker capable of continuous navigation in water for months and breaking through years of ice. How can we not cheer for them!

The feats of the Soviet space conquerors herald a new era, when people, relying on profound knowledge of the laws of physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, and other sciences, have created a force capable of sending large spacecraft from Earth to other celestial bodies and accurately flying them to predetermined locations.

Why were the Soviet people the first in the world to solve such a difficult and truly significant problem as launching a rocket to the Moon, a task involving so many mysteries! The victory was achieved because the Soviet people worked heroically, successfully solving the greatest social problems in a very short historical period—they built a socialist society and are now confidently building communism.

The Soviet rocket's unprecedented flight to the Moon and the launch of the "Lenin" atomic icebreaker convincingly prove that our people, in accordance with the historic resolution of the 21st Party Congress, are successfully building the material and technical foundation of communist society. Only those who deliberately close their eyes and are unwilling to see reality can doubt the unlimited possibilities that communism opens up for human progress.

The news of the rocket reaching the Moon filled the Soviet people with pleasant excitement and agitation. They are proud of their scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers, who for the first time in the world successfully launched a container with scientific instruments and marked with the Soviet national emblem to the Moon, thereby achieving priority for our country. Thus, the priority of the first successful flight of a rocket to the Moon firmly belongs to us, to the Soviet Union.

Of course, we understand that the victory of our space conquerors is the achievement of the entire Soviet people, the victory of the entire socialist camp. It is an outstanding contribution to the development of world science, an achievement of world significance.

The launching of the atomic-powered icebreaker "Lenin" is also symbolic. It is no accident that it is the Soviet people who first started an atomic power station and first started an atomic icebreaker sailing in the world. We have thus once again clearly demonstrated that the Soviet people are determined to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Our atomic icebreaker "Lenin" will not only break through the ice in the ocean, but also break through the ice of the "Cold War." It will penetrate into people's hearts, calling on the people of all countries to launch a competition between countries not in expanding armaments, but in using atomic energy for the benefit of mankind, to warm people's hearts and bodies, and to create everything that people need. We are willing to cooperate with the people of all countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and we would be very happy if all countries responded to this call.

The Soviet scientists who made the rocket and launched it to the Moon gave me a replica of the emblem sent to the Moon by the Soviet rocket. I will be honored to present this replica to U.S. President Eisenhower. Let this mark be a symbol of the call for Soviet and American scientists, engineers, and workers to work together, for our two peoples to work together in creative labor, in improving relations between our two countries, and in the struggle for peace for the people of all countries.

I want to assure my dear compatriots and all those who wrote and telegraphed me congratulations on my visit to the United States that I will do everything I can to live up to your expectations. I do not doubt the goodwill of the U.S. President. He invited me to visit the United States, and he also obviously hopes to find a common language to resolve international disputes and improve relations between our two countries.

The main goal we should achieve is to guarantee peaceful living conditions for all people on earth.

Dear comrades and foreign friends, thank you for your good wishes.

                                                                        N. Khrushchev
                                                                        September 14, 1959

### 赫鲁晓夫在访美前夕发表公开信  为改善国际局势创造良好开端  火箭到达月球和原子破冰船开航表明苏联人民和平愿望

    赫鲁晓夫在访美前夕发表公开信
    为改善国际局势创造良好开端
    火箭到达月球和原子破冰船开航表明苏联人民和平愿望
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫14日发表一封公开信，答复他由于到美国访问而收到的信件和电报，全文如下：
    由于我要到美国访问，我收到了从苏联人，以及其他国家公民，其中包括美国人写来的信件和电报。这些信件和电报表示希望，我的访问将有利于改善苏联和美国之间的相互关系，同美国总统艾森豪威尔先生交换意见将为国际局势的改善创造一个良好开端。
    现在，人类正处在一个美好的时代。这是一个科学、技术、经济、文化繁荣的时代，在这个时代，童话正在变成事实。当我们到美国访问的时候，恰巧碰上了两个极伟大事件：苏联人民从地球上发射的宇宙火箭在历史上第一次顺利地飞到了月球，以及世界上第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”已经开航。
    曾经写过多少关于飞到月球上去的幻想小说，童话和诗篇呵！人们世世代代都曾梦想过星际旅行，而现在我们就跨进了实现这一大胆梦想的大门。数十年来科学家们一直努力建造一艘能够直闯北极的轮船，这条轮船已经建成了。
    苏联科学家、工程师、技术人员和工人分秒不差地计算和实现了火箭沿着从地球到月球的路线的非常出色的飞行，这个伟大的功绩怎能叫我们苏联人——不只是我们苏联人，并且是所有善良的人不感到欢欣鼓舞，不纷纷颂扬呢！苏联科学家、工程师、技术人员和工人建造了世界上第一艘能够在水中连续航行数个月和划破积年冰层的原子破冰船，我们怎能不为他们欢呼呢！
    苏联宇宙征服者的功勋预告了一个新时代的来临，这时候人们依靠物理、化学、数学、天文学和其他科学规律的深奥知识，制造了一种能够把很大的宇宙飞船从地球送到其他天体，并使它准确地飞抵预定地点的力量。
    为什么苏联人在世界上第一个解决了向月球发射火箭这样一个这么困难和真正有伟大意义的问题呢，这可是一项包括着许多谜的任务啊！这个胜利之所以能够获得，是由于苏联人进行了英勇的劳动，用自己的双手在极短的历史时期内成功地解决了最伟大的社会问题——他们建成了社会主义社会，现在正在满怀信心地建设共产主义。
    苏联火箭史无前例地飞往月球和“列宁号”原子破冰船的开航，令人信服地证明，我国人民遵照第二十一次党代表大会的历史性决议。顺利地建立着共产主义社会的物质技术基础。只有故意闭起眼睛，不愿意看到现实的人才会怀疑共产主义为人类进步所开辟的无限可能性。
    火箭飞到月球的消息使苏联人感到愉快的兴奋和激动。他们为自己的科学家、工程师、技术员和工人而骄傲，这些人在世界上第一次成功地把带有科学仪器和刻着苏联国徽标志的容器发射到月球上去，从而为我国取得了优先地位。这样，火箭第一次成功地飞向月球的优先权就巩固地属于我们，属于苏联了。
    当然，我们明白，我们的宇宙征服者的胜利，是全体苏联人民的功绩，是整个社会主义阵营的胜利。这是对世界科学发展的卓越贡献，是具有世界意义的成就。
    用原子能发动的“列宁号”破冰船的下水也具有象征意义。在世界上第一个开动原子能发电站，第一个使原子破冰船开始航行的正是苏联人，这不是偶然的。我们就这样再一次明显地表明，苏联人决心要和平利用原子能。
    我们的原子破冰船“列宁号”不仅要划破海洋中的冰层，并且要划破“冷战”的冰层。它将深入人心，呼吁各国人民使国与国之间不要在扩充军备方面展开竞赛，而要在利用原子能为人造福，温暖人们的身心以及创造人们所需要的一切东西方面展开竞赛。我们愿意在和平利用原子能方面同各国人民合作，如果各国都响应这个呼吁，我们会感到非常高兴。
    制造火箭和把它发射到月球去的苏联科学家交给我一个用苏联火箭送到月球的标记的复制品。我将荣幸地把这个标记的复制品送给美国总统艾森豪威尔先生。让这个标记成为号召苏联和美国科学家、工程师、工人共同努力，号召我们两国人民在创造性的劳动中，在改善我们两国的关系、争取世界各国人民的和平的斗争中共同努力的象征。
    我要向亲爱的同胞们以及所有写信和拍电报祝贺我到美国访问的人保证，我将尽一切努力不辜负你们的期望。我并不怀疑美国总统的善良愿望。他邀请我访问美国，显然他也是希望找到共同的语言来解决国际争端和改善我们两国的关系的。
    我们应当达到的主要的目标是为地球上所有的人保障和平的生活条件。
    亲爱的同志们和外国朋友们，感谢你们的良好祝愿。
            尼·赫鲁晓夫
              1959年9月14日
