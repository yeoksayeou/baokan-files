    “Conforming to Heavenly Principles, Responding to Human Sentiments”
  　Yi Heyuan
    In just over ten days, it will be the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    For ten years since the founding of New China, the imperialists have slandered, attacked, and cursed us. Especially in this past year, they seem even more rampant, unleashing every vicious curse. They claim our General Line is a mess, the Great Leap Forward is a mess, the People's Communes are about to collapse, and so on. From their venomous mouths, they spew a chorus of "Collapse, collapse," as if New China is really about to "collapse."

    This is truly wishful thinking! New China stands tall in the East like a giant, striding forward towards magnificent goals, towards an even happier life. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, as the masses have likened them, are our nation's "Three Treasures," shining brightly and guiding our direction forward.

    Faced with the undeniable and immense achievements of our construction, the enemy is panic-stricken. Although they still clamor and curse "Collapse, collapse" with their mouths, what echoes in their hearts is a chorus of "Suffering, suffering."

    Why won't our revolutionary cause collapse? Why will it only flourish and prosper? The imperialist lords don't want to understand this point, and they will never understand it. But in our view, the principle is simple and clear. Sun Yat-sen, our great democrat, once said: "If a cause conforms to heavenly principles, responds to human sentiments, suits the world's trend, meets the needs of the people, and is resolutely pursued by those who are enlightened and foresighted, then it will undoubtedly succeed..." (The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction) These are truly wise words, and countless living facts prove that this is an irrefutable truth.

    Our revolutionary cause is precisely a cause that "conforms to heavenly principles, responds to human sentiments, suits the world's trend, and meets the needs of the people." To "conform to heavenly principles" means to adapt to the laws of social development. To "suit the world's trend" means to follow the socialist trend, which is surging and unstoppable, longed for and loved by the working people of the whole world. And our Communist Party and the advanced elements among the working people are precisely the enlightened and foresighted individuals who are determined to promote this great cause. Such a cause is bound to succeed, cannot be cursed into collapse, and cannot be crushed by pressure.

    Our revolutionary cause, from the very beginning, has suffered attacks and curses from enemies at home and abroad, hoping we would collapse. They even frantically used military encirclement and suppression to try to crush us, hoping to bring us down, but all their efforts were in vain. Because our cause is in line with the demands of history and the needs of the masses, it is full of vitality. "A single spark can start a prairie fire," and revolutionary forces gradually developed and finally achieved final victory. As for the Kuomintang reactionaries, because their actions did not conform to the demands of history and the needs of the people, they represented a decaying force. Although American imperialism tried every possible way to aid them and support them, it still could not save them from the fate of collapse. This precisely echoes a Chinese proverb: "Those who obey Heaven prosper, those who defy Heaven perish" – those who violate the demands of history are destined to collapse.

    It is only natural that reactionaries at home and abroad do not understand these principles, because they are born with a reactionary nature. Let them bark wildly, curse, and cry out in pain – we don't care about them. What is strange is that some domestic right-leaning opportunists also parrot them, clamoring that this is a mess, that is ruined, and so on. If they haven't been drugged by the enemy and become delirious and blind, then there must be a problem with their standpoint. Therefore, they cannot see that the Party's General Line for building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement are the inevitable products of historical development, and the embodiment of the desire of the people of the whole country to change our country's "poor and blank" face, and were not created out of thin air. They also cannot see the great achievements made by the cause that the people of the whole country are "determined to pursue," but nitpick, dwelling on the slightest shortcomings in our work that have been corrected and are being corrected, and pouring cold water on the masses. Yet, they argue plausibly that this is done with good intentions, fearing that we will run into trouble and "collapse."

    Thank you for your good intentions! Our great revolutionary cause cannot be cursed into collapse by the imperialists, nor can it be doused by the cold water of the right-leaning opportunists! The fact is that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are like a transparent mirror, revealing the true colors of these right-leaning opportunists. Their footing is unstable, and they are tilting precariously towards the edge of the cliff, facing the abyss, with the danger of "collapsing" down. And we are willing to extend a warm helping hand, if they are willing to turn around and reach out.

    “顺乎天理  应乎人情”
  　易和元
    再过十多天，就是中华人民共和国建国十周年的大喜日了。
    新中国成立了十年，帝国主义就污蔑、攻击和诅咒了我们十年，尤其是最近这一年似乎更显得嚣张，一切恶毒的咒语都使出来了，什么我们的总路线搞糟了，大跃进搞糟了，人民公社要垮了等等，诸如此类，不一而足。从他们恶毒的嘴里向我们喷来的是一片“垮也，垮也”之声，好像新中国真的就要“垮了”似的。
    这真是痴人做梦！新中国像一个巨人一样屹立在世界的东方，它正大踏步地向着宏伟的目标，向着更加幸福的生活前进。总路线、大跃进、人民公社，正如群众所比喻的是我们国家的“三宝”，它光芒四射，指引着我们前进的方向。
    在无可辩驳的我们建设的巨大成就面前，敌人惊惶失措了，他们口里虽然还在嚷着诅咒着“垮也，垮也”，而在他们心里响着的却是一片“苦也，苦也”。
    我们的革命事业为什么不会垮，为什么它只会蒸蒸日上，欣欣向荣？这点，帝国主义老爷们不想明白，也永远弄不明白。而在我们看来，道理却简单明了。我国伟大的民主主义者孙中山先生曾经说过：“夫事有顺乎天理，应乎人情，适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要，而为先知先觉者所决志行之，则断无不成者也……”（建国方略）真是至理名言，无数活生生的事实证明这是一个颠扑不破的真理。
    我们的革命事业正是“顺乎天理，应乎人情，适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”的事业。所谓“顺乎天理”，就是适应社会发展规律，所谓“适乎世界之潮流”，就是社会主义的潮流，它汹涌澎湃，所向无前，为全世界劳动人民所向往，所热爱。而我们共产党和劳动人民中的先进分子，正是决志推行这种伟大事业的先知先觉者，这样的事业是断无不成的，是诅咒咒不垮的，是压力压不垮的。
    我们的革命事业，从一开始就遭受国内外敌人的进攻和诅咒，希望我们垮；他们也曾疯狂地用军事清剿来压过我们，希望把我们压垮，但是都枉费心机。因为我们的事业是符合历史的要求和群众的需要的，是富有生命力的。“星星之火，可以燎原”，革命力量逐步向前发展，终于取得了最后的胜利。而国民党反动派呢，因为他们的所作所为不合乎历史的要求和人民的需要，他们代表的是腐朽的力量，虽然美帝国主义千方百计地援助他，扶持他，还是挽回不了垮的命运，这正应了我国一句俗话：“顺天者昌，逆天者亡”——违反历史要求的人注定是要垮的。
    国内外反动派不明白这些道理是很自然的，因为他们生就一副反动的骨头，他们狂吠也罢，诅咒也罢，叫苦也罢，且不去管他。奇怪的是国内的一些右倾机会主义分子也鹦鹉学舌地叫嚷起来，说这样搞糟了，那样搞坏了，等等。如果不是他们喝了敌人的蒙汗药，神志昏迷，瞎了眼睛；便是立场有了问题。因此他们才看不见党的建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动是历史发展的必然产物，是全国人民要改变我们国家“一穷二白”面貌愿望的体现，并不是凭空创造出来的；他们也看不见全国人民所“决志行之”的事业所取得的伟大成绩，而吹毛求疵，津津乐道我们工作中一丁半点已经改正和正在改正的缺点，向群众大泼冷水。他们却振振有词地说，这是一片好心，怕我们会出乱子，会“垮”。
    多谢一片好心！我们伟大的革命事业，帝国主义的诅咒咒不垮，右倾机会主义分子的冷水也是泼不垮的！事实倒是，总路线、大跃进、人民公社像一面透明的镜子照出了这些右倾机会主义分子的原形。他们立脚不稳，正在歪歪斜斜地倒向悬岩的边沿，面临深渊，有“垮”下去的危险。而我们是愿意伸出热情的救援之手的，如果他们愿意回头，伸过手来的话。
