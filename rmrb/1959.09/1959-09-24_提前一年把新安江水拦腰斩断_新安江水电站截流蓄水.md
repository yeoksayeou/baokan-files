Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 22nd. From 12:00 to 15:43 on the 21st, the construction workers at the Xin'an River Hydropower Station construction site lowered the last diversion bottom hole gate. Thus, the river closure project of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station was completed one year ahead of schedule. The water from the upper reaches of the Xin'an River is blocked here by the iron-wall-like dam, and stored in the reservoir. The construction of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station has entered a new stage, which is to continue raising the dam to ensure safe overflow and flood discharge during next year's flood season, while concentrating efforts on the large-scale installation of mechanical and electrical equipment.

The Xin'an River Hydropower Station is a large-scale hydropower station designed by our country itself. Construction began in 1957, and the original plan was to complete it in five years, striving to close the river and store water in 1960, and generate electricity in 1961; now, due to the river closure and water storage being completed one year ahead of schedule, the date of starting power generation will be greatly advanced. This is a great victory for the construction workers in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, and also a major achievement for them in responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing Right opportunism, and boosting morale with practical actions. They dedicate this achievement to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country.

### 提前一年把新安江水拦腰斩断  新安江水电站截流蓄水

    提前一年把新安江水拦腰斩断
    新安江水电站截流蓄水
    新华社杭州22日电　21日十二点到十五点四十三分，新安江水电站工地的建设工人们放下了最后一扇导流底孔闸门。至此，新安江水电站的截流工程比原计划提前一年完成了。新安江上游的水在这里被铁壁一样的拦江大坝堵住，蓄入水库。新安江水电站工程的建设又进入一个新的阶段，那就是在继续加高大坝、以确保明年汛期安全溢泄洪水的同时，集中力量大规模地安装机电设备。
    新安江水电站是我国自己设计的大型水电站，1957年开工建设，原计划施工期限为五年，力争在1960年截流蓄水，1961年发电；现在由于提前一年截流蓄水，开始发电日期就将大大提前。这是建设工人们贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的巨大胜利，也是他们以实际行动响应党的八届八中全会号召，反右倾、鼓干劲的重大成就。他们以这个成就向建国十周年献礼。
