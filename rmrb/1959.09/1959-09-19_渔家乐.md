Fisherman's Joy
By our reporter Liu Fan

The motorized junk was speeding through the boundless East Sea. Old Xia pointed to the right and said to me, "Look, we're almost to our destination, Ant Island." As he spoke, he pushed the rudder, and the boat steered towards the island.

Ant Island is a small island in the Zhoushan Archipelago. This island, only five square kilometers in area, is shaped like an ant, surrounded by a vast expanse of sea connecting with the sky. All of the island's 580-plus fishing households have joined the Ant People's Commune.

Stepping onto Ant Island, all you see are rows of neat, blue-grey buildings standing at the foot of the mountain. We passed through a bustling little street and, turning a corner, arrived at the commune's canteen. After a sumptuous dinner at the canteen, Old Xia pulled us toward his home.

This young man, Xia Jintang, came from a fishing family. A few days ago, I heard from the Zhoushan County Party Committee that in 1950, the year of liberation, Xia Jintang's family of six had to share a tattered quilt that was already twenty-six years old; his eight-year-old little sister had no pants to wear; they had no house of their own, moving eight times in one year; they had no money to buy grain and relied on government relief to survive… But, looking at Xia Jintang walking beside us now, it was impossible to imagine that he had once been so poor. He was wearing a black cotton jacket and trousers, the kind fishermen like to wear, looking energetic and chatting with us cheerfully as we walked.

"Old Xia, I heard you have over 1,300 yuan in savings and are living a happy life!"

"You mean savings? Hehe, the whole family has almost 2,000 yuan!" Xia Jintang said happily, "It's all thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's good leadership! After liberation, since the overthrow of the fishing bullies and feudal fishmongers, and from the cooperative to the commune, every fishing family's life has been rising step by step."

Indeed, the lives of the fishermen on Ant Island are rising step by step. Before liberation, the fishermen lived in abject poverty under the exploitation of fishing bullies and fishmongers. On the eve of liberation, the little property the fishermen had was looted by the Kuomintang bandits, and most of the fishing boats and gear were destroyed. By the time of liberation, only forty dilapidated fishing boats remained on the island, and the fishermen could not go to sea to produce. At this time, the Party and the government, on the one hand, issued loans and grain to relieve the fishermen; on the other hand, they led the fishermen to organize mutual aid teams to overcome the difficulties that individual households could not overcome in restoring production. From the achievements of the mutual aid teams, the fishermen felt the greatness of collective strength, and in 1953, under the leadership of the Party, they organized four fishing cooperatives. In this year, the output of fishery increased several times, and the public accumulation increased from only ten yuan when the cooperatives were first established to 13,000 yuan. However, new contradictions arose at this time: in expanding production, the four fishing cooperatives competed with each other for inshore fishing grounds, and disputes occurred constantly. If they wanted to develop deep-sea fishing, each cooperative lacked funds and could not do it. In order to solve this contradiction, the Party, according to the demands of the vast number of cooperative members, led the merger of the four small cooperatives into one large cooperative in 1954. With the establishment of the large cooperative, because of the large number of people and the large amount of capital, it not only solved the original contradictions but also developed deep-sea fishing operations. With the development of production, the public accumulation in the cooperative increased, pairs of large fishing boats and motorized junks were built, and the income of the cooperative members also increased rapidly. However, contradictions arose between the island's fishing production and agricultural production. Fishermen who went to deep-sea production for several months often could not take care of agricultural production. Sometimes, if they took care of agricultural production, they could not spare more manpower for fishing. This contradiction was not resolved until the establishment of the People's Commune last year. The commune established canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, liberating nearly 50% of the women in the commune from housework. They formed a women's agricultural team, specifically responsible for agricultural production. In this way, all aspects of production in the commune, with fishery as the main focus, have been fully developed. Now the commune has more than one million yuan of public accumulation and public property, and each cooperative member has several hundred or thousands of yuan in savings, and their lives are becoming more and more prosperous…

We walked and talked in the moonlight, and soon we arrived at Xia Jintang's home.

Xia Jintang's family now lives in a comfortable little building. He lives with his elderly parents and two younger sisters. In the room where he and his wife live, there is a large wardrobe, a cabinet for quilts, two red lacquered wooden boxes, a table, a red lacquered bed, the mosquito net and quilt are new, and a grandfather clock stands on the wardrobe, ticking rhythmically. The room is truly bright and clean!

I had long heard that Xia Jintang is a person who is never satisfied with the status quo. After liberation, especially after cooperativization, the bright and splendid prospects inspired him with many beautiful ideals for fishery production. At that time, he hoped to use motorized junks for fishing and to have electric lights and telephones on the island. After the communization, this ideal was basically realized. Now he wants to use large fishing trawlers for fishing. He not only has beautiful ideals but is also willing to work hard and diligently. He studied the tides and the characteristics of fish and shrimp in the waters near Ant Island day and night, improving the shrimp trawl net, which increased the yield by one to two times. At that time, he received a reward from the Zhoushan Special District and was named an outstanding cooperative member.

Xia Jintang's parents and sisters also joined our conversation. As we were talking, his wife, Liu Yazhu, returned. Liu Yazhu is a capable woman famous throughout the island, quick at farming, fishing, and knitting nets.

"Now the fishermen's lives are in heaven," Liu Yazhu said. "In the past, our family also had six people, and we only had one tattered quilt for spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Now we have eleven quilts. In the past, we saw the fishing bullies wearing woolen sweaters, but now we six people have fourteen woolen sweaters and trousers." She couldn't hide her inner joy, and she spoke more and more vigorously, "We women want to talk about emancipation, and now we are truly and thoroughly liberated. Now women walk out of the kitchen and sit on an equal footing with men, working and going to sea together, eating in the canteen, and studying at night school. There is true equality between men and women." As she spoke, she looked up at Xia Jintang, and the two smiled at each other. Everyone laughed too.

"Silly girl, what are you laughing at?" Jintang said to his sister, unable to hide his smile.

"Laughing at how affectionate you two are!"

It turned out that Liu Yazhu was a child bride, and she was only liberated from a life of humiliation when the Marriage Law was promulgated. After that, she became a people's representative on the island, and Xia Jintang was also a people's representative. That's how they met and later got married.

"'Five Excellents,' if you laugh again, I'll reveal your secrets!" her sister-in-law teased her helplessly.

"Go ahead, I'm open and honest."

Mentioning Xia Jintang's younger sister, Xia Duoyue, inadvertently evoked a bitter history from the old mother, but she narrated it happily: Seventeen years ago, when Duoyue came out of her womb, the family was destitute. Poverty, coupled with many children, forced the mother to make a cruel decision to abandon her. The mother, holding the crying baby, shed sad tears, saying, "Oh, my child! The world is not easy to live in. Go and be reborn into a better life!" She took off the single garment she was wearing, wrapped the baby, and placed her on the ground. She thought the pain would pass quickly. However, the child's crying grew louder and louder. The maternal grandfather, who lived on the east side of the village, heard the crying and ran over. The grandfather blamed his daughter, "Why do you do this? We should suffer together. We shouldn't harm a life. We will eventually have days when the suffering ends." That's how Duoyue stayed. At this time, the mother wiped the tears from her face and, with a happy smile, continued, "I didn't expect this child to have such good fortune now. After graduating from elementary school, because the commune urgently needed doctors, she was recommended by the commune to study medicine at a nearby naval hospital. Now she is a trainee doctor in the commune. All day long, she is either laughing or singing, singing 'The People's Commune is Good,' singing 'Red Glow,' singing 'The Heroic Flower Doesn't Bloom Until We See It'."

"'Five Excellents,' what does that name mean?"

Everyone just laughed and remained silent. Finally, Xia Jintang opened his mouth and said, "It's an excessive compliment from others. It's like this, there are six people in my family. My father is already sixty years old. According to the commune's regulations, he can retire and enjoy himself. But he still goes out to sea to fish every day without stopping, rain or shine, and he also wants to train a new leader! My mother is firing up the stoves in the canteen, firing up six stoves all by herself. Because there is not much firewood on the island, she created a method of slow-burning with a low flame; she also uses her rest time to pick up broken grass in the garbage dump, saving more than 20% on firewood. Yazhu is the director of the commune's women's affairs. Because she actively leads women in production, she was elected as a women's activist and went to Beijing last year to participate in the representative conference of socialist construction women activists. And me, I'm still not good enough! The four of us have been elected as excellent cooperative members. Duoyue, in the past, was an excellent student. Now she has only been at the commune hospital for less than half a month. If you call her an excellent student, that's a thing of the past; if you call her an excellent cooperative member, she's not one yet. So people joke with her and call her 'Five Excellents'."

Speaking of excellent cooperative members, the whole family was particularly happy. Old Man Xia, sitting on the corner of the bed, put his hands on the bed and stood up, saying, "I worked as a fisherman for thirty-three years in the old society, working for the fishing bullies on an empty stomach, and I still had to put up with their glares. Now that we are communized, my whole family, except for eating, has a net income of 100 yuan per month. I can work after eating my fill, and everyone praises me, an old man, and gave me a bonus of ninety yuan for exceeding production during the spring and summer fishing seasons. Tell me, can I sit at home in peace?" His words brought a burst of laughter from everyone.

Everyone talked enthusiastically until late at night. At this time, the bright moon shone through the window, illuminating the room exceptionally brightly. We reluctantly ended this joyful fisherman's night talk. I walked back to the commune's guest house, stood upstairs, and saw the silvery sea, with white waves surging. The sea seemed to be singing for the happy fishing family. (Attached picture)

    渔家乐
    本报记者　刘凡
    机帆船正在漫无边际的东海上破浪疾驰。夏老大朝右边一指，向我说：“看，我们的目的地蚂蚁岛要到了。”说着，他把舵一推，船向海岛驶去。
    蚂蚁岛是舟山群岛中的一座小岛，这座方圆只有五平方公里的海岛，形状像一只蚂蚁，四面是白茫茫一片大海连接着天空。岛上五百八十多户渔民，全部参加了蚂蚁人民公社。
    登上蚂蚁岛，只见一栋栋青色楼房整整齐齐地矗立在山脚下。我们穿过一条繁华的小街，一转弯就到了公社的食堂。在食堂吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐后，夏老大便拉着我们向他家走去。
    这个渔工出身的青年，名叫夏金堂。几天前，我在舟山县委就听说：1950年解放那年，夏金堂一家六口人合盖一条已经盖了二十六年的破被子，八岁的小妹子没有裤子穿；自己没有房子，一年搬了八次家；没有钱买粮食，靠吃政府的救济粮过活……。但是，看到现在走在我们身边的夏金堂，怎么也想不到他曾经那样贫困。他穿着一身渔民爱穿的黑色洋布褂裤，精神爽朗，心情愉快地和我们边走边聊。
    “老夏，听说你存款有一千三百多元，生活过得满幸福呀！”
    “你说存款吗？嘿嘿，全家算算快两千元啦！”夏金堂愉快地说：“全是毛主席、共产党领导得好！解放以后，自从打倒了渔霸和封建渔行，又从合作社转到公社，家家渔民生活都步步高升啦。”
    的确，蚂蚁岛渔民的生活在步步高升。解放前，渔民们在渔霸、渔行主的压榨下，生活贫困不堪。解放前夕，全岛渔民仅有的一点可怜财产，又被国民党匪军抢劫一空，大部分渔船、渔具遭到破坏；到解放时，全岛只剩下四十只破烂的渔船，渔民无法下海生产。这时，党和政府一方面发放贷粮贷款，救济渔民；一方面领导渔民组织互助组，克服了单干户在恢复生产中所不能克服的困难。渔民们从互助组的成就中，感到了集体力量的伟大，1953年就在党的领导下组织了四个渔业社。这一年渔业产量提高了几倍，公共积累由办社时仅有的十元，增加到一万三千元。但是，这时又发生了新的矛盾：四个渔业社在扩大生产中，互相争占近洋渔场，不断发生纠纷；要想发展远洋渔业，各社又因资金少、办不到。为了解决这个矛盾，党便根据广大社员的要求，在1954年领导四个小社合并建成了一个大社。大社一成立，由于人多资金多，不仅解决了原来的矛盾，还发展了远洋捕鱼作业。随着生产的发展，社里的公共积累增加了，一对对的大捕鱼船和机帆船建造起来了，社员的收入也迅速增多。但是岛上的渔业生产和农业生产又发生了矛盾，渔民去远洋生产几个月，常常顾不了农业生产；有时顾了农业生产，就不能抽出更多的人力去捕鱼。这个矛盾直到去年建立人民公社才得到了解决。公社办了食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，把占全社人口将近50％的妇女从家务劳动中解放出来。她们组成了一个妇女农业队，专门负责农业生产。这样，全社以渔业为主的各项生产，就得到了全面发展。现在公社有一百多万元的公共积累和公共财产，每户社员都有几百或成千元的存款，生活愈来愈富裕……。
    我们在月色下，边走边谈，一会儿来到了夏金堂的家里。
    夏金堂一家，现在住的是一幢舒畅的小楼房。他和年老的父母、两个妹妹同住在一起。在他夫妇住的房间里，摆了一个大衣橱，一个被柜，两个红漆木箱子，一张桌子，一张红漆床，蚊帐、被子都是新的，一台座钟放在衣柜上，滴滴答答地发出有节奏的声音。屋里真是窗明几净！
    早就听说，夏金堂是个永不满足现状的人。解放以后，特别是合作化以后，一片光明灿烂的前景，引得他对渔业生产产生了许许多多的美好的理想。当时他希望出海捕鱼用机帆船，住在岛上有电灯、电话。公社化后，这个理想基本上实现了。现在他又想用大鱼轮捕鱼了。他不仅有美好的理想，还肯踏踏实实地苦钻、苦干。他曾日夜不休地研究蚂蚁岛附近海洋的潮水和鱼虾特性，改进了虾板子网，使产量提高了一倍到二倍。当时他得到舟山专区的奖励，被评为优秀社员。
    夏金堂的父母和妹妹也参加了我们的谈话。正谈着，他的爱人刘亚珠回来了。刘亚珠是闻名全岛的能干妇女，下地种田、下海捕鱼、坐下来织网都是快手。
    “现在渔民生活上了天堂。”刘亚珠说，“以前，我们一家也是六口人，春夏秋冬只有一条破被子，现在有了十一条被子；过去我们看渔霸穿毛线衣，现在我们六个人有十四件毛衣裤。”她掩不住内心的愉快，越说越起劲：“我们妇女要说翻身，现在真是彻底翻了个儿。现在女人走出厨房，和男人平起平坐，同出工，同下海，吃饭进食堂，读书到夜校，真正是男女平等了。”说着，她抬起头来看看夏金堂，两个人相视着笑了。大家也都笑起来。
    “傻丫头，笑什么？”金堂掩不住笑脸朝他妹妹说。
    “笑你俩那亲热相！”
    原来，刘亚珠是童养媳，婚姻法颁布时，她才从屈辱的生活中解放出来。此后，她成了岛上的人民代表，而夏金堂也是人民代表，他们就这样相识了，后来结了婚。
    “‘五优秀’，你再笑，我要揭你的底啦！”嫂嫂无奈地逗她。
    “你揭呗，光明磊落。”
    提起夏金堂的妹妹夏多月，无意中勾起了老母亲的一段辛酸史，但她却又幸福地叙述着：十七年前，多月从娘胎里出来时，家里一贫如洗。贫困加上儿女多，逼着做母亲的下了狠心，要把她扔掉。母亲抱着啼哭的婴儿，流着伤心的眼泪，念着“儿啊！这世道不好过，你去从新投过好胎吧！”她脱下身上的单衣，包好婴儿，放在地上。她想，痛苦会很快过去的。然而这孩子啼哭声越来越大，住在村东边的外公听到哭声，跑来了。外公责怪女儿：“你何必这样做，要苦大家一道苦，不应该伤害一条生命，我们总有苦到头的日子。”多月就这样留了下来。这时，母亲拭去脸上的眼泪，露出幸福的微笑继续说：“没想到这孩子现在这样好的福气。小学毕业后，因为公社急需医生，就由公社保送到附近的海军医院学医，现在她是公社的见习医生。整天不是笑就是唱，唱‘人民公社好’，唱‘红霞’，唱‘不见那英雄花不开’。”
    “‘五优秀’这个名字是什么意思？”
    大家只是笑，都沉默不言。最后还是夏金堂开口说：“这是人家过分的夸奖。是这样，我家有六口人，阿爸已六十岁了，按公社规定，他可以退休享福了。但他仍然一天不停、风雨无阻地出海捕鱼，还要培养出个新老大呢！阿妈呢，在食堂里烧火，一个人烧六个锅。因为岛上柴火不多，她就创造微火细烧的办法；还利用休息时间到垃圾堆里拾碎草，使烧柴节省了20％以上。亚珠是公社妇女主任，因为积极领导妇女生产，被选为妇女积极分子，去年上北京参加了社会主义建设妇女积极分子代表大会。还有我，我还很不够！我们四人都被选为优秀社员。多月呢，过去是优秀生，现在到公社医院还不到半个月，你叫她优秀生吧，那是过去的事；你叫她优秀社员吧，现在还不是。于是人家就和她开玩笑，叫她‘五优秀’。”
    说起优秀社员，全家人都格外高兴。坐在床角边的夏老汉，这时双手一撑，站起来说：“我在旧社会做了三十三年渔工，饿着肚子给渔霸干活，还受人家的眼色。如今公社化了，我全家除掉吃饭，每月还净收入一百元。吃饱了肚子来干活，大伙儿还表扬我老汉，春夏鱼汛还给了我九十元的超产奖金。你说，这能叫我安心坐在家里吗？”他的话引起大家一阵欢笑。
    大家兴致勃勃地一直谈到夜深人静。这时明月透窗而入，把屋里照得分外光明。我们依依不舍地结束了这一场快乐的渔家夜谈。我走回公社招待所，站在楼上，只见那银光闪闪的海面，白浪滔滔，大海仿佛正为幸福的渔家在歌唱。（附图片）
