Xinhua News Agency, September 9th. Vice Premier Chen Yi said today: "We fully support the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 9 regarding the United Nations Security Council's decision to establish a so-called Laotian situation investigation committee. The Laotian issue is a matter for the Laotian authorities to correctly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. The United Nations has absolutely no right to intervene."

Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke about the current situation in Laos at a reception held by the Bulgarian Ambassador to China this evening to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Bulgarian Socialist Revolution. In his speech, he also said: "Any attempt to interfere in the Laotian issue through the United Nations will only exacerbate the tension in the region and will not be conducive to the resolution of the Laotian issue. We believe that the United States must withdraw its military personnel from Laos and dismantle its military bases in Laos. The International Commission for Laos, chaired by India, should also resume its activities immediately to safeguard peace in Laos."

Vice Premier Chen Yi further said: "A handful of people in the ruling group of the United States who oppose the easing of the international situation are instigating the Laotian reactionaries to raise the issue of the so-called 'aggression' of Laos by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and to demand that the United Nations send 'emergency forces' to Laos, in order to expand the Laotian war that they single-handedly created and to poison the international atmosphere. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently strictly adhered to the Geneva Accords and has made unremitting efforts to maintain peace in Indochina. No slander or fabrication can change this ironclad fact."

Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech was warmly welcomed by Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception.

    陈毅副总理在保大使招待会上表示支持越南政府的声明
    联合国根本无权过问老挝问题
    周恩来总理到会祝贺中保两国的友谊和世界各国人民的团结
    潘切夫斯基大使热烈祝贺中国人民在大跃进中获得更大成就
    新华社9日讯　陈毅副总理今天说：“我们完全支持越南民主共和国政府9月9日就联合国安全理事会决定成立所谓老挝局势调查委员会问题发表的声明。老挝问题是老挝当局应该正确履行日内瓦协议和万象协议的问题，联合国根本无权过问。”
    陈毅副总理今晚在保加利亚驻华大使庆祝保加利亚社会主义革命十五周年的招待会上谈到了目前的老挝局势。他在讲话中还说：“任何以联合国来干涉老挝问题的企图，只会加剧这一地区的紧张局势，而不利于老挝问题的解决。我们认为，美国必须撤走它在老挝的军事人员，撤销它在老挝的军事基地。以印度为主席的老挝国际委员会也应该立即恢复活动，以维护老挝的和平。”
    陈毅副总理又说：“美国统治集团一小撮反对国际局势和缓的人们，正唆使老挝的反动派向联合国提出所谓越南民主共和国‘侵略’老挝和要求联合国派‘紧急部队’到老挝去的问题，以便扩大他们一手造成的老挝战争，毒化国际气氛。越南民主共和国一贯严格遵守日内瓦协议，为维护印度支那和平作出了不懈的努力。任何诬蔑和捏造都不能改变这一铁的事实。”
    陈毅副总理的讲话受到了出席招待会的中外人士的热烈欢迎。
