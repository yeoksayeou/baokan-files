Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 1st. Sangbu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia, said tonight that the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the entire Mongolian people unanimously praise and support the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Chairman Sangbu made these remarks at a reception held by Xie Fusheng, the Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, for the visit to Mongolia of the delegation of the National People's Congress of China headed by Vice Chairman Lin Boqu. He said that the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee summarized the great cause of the heroic Chinese people and the outstanding Party, and made important resolutions to further accelerate the development of the motherland, consolidate the people's communes, and continue the Great Leap Forward. We firmly believe that the malicious attacks and slanders of imperialism will be thoroughly defeated. There is no doubt that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the great leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people will surely achieve even greater victories in the cause of socialist construction and make significant contributions to the cause of consolidating the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Sangbu said that the Mongolian people feel heartfelt joy at the brilliant victories of the Chinese people.

He said that the visit to Mongolia by the delegation of the National People's Congress of China headed by Comrade Lin Boqu has further consolidated the fraternal friendly and cooperative relations between the Mongolian and Chinese people. He said that under the wise leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people have shaken off backwardness and are carrying out socialist construction. The Mongolian people express their gratitude for the assistance they have received from the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people in this construction.

Also present at this evening's reception were Tsend, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Molomjamts and Lhamsuren, Vice Chairmen of the Council of Ministers, Jalkhasaikhan, Chairman of the Great People's Hural, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia.

At the beginning of the reception, Ambassador Xie Fusheng raised his glass to wish the unbreakable friendship and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples would be increasingly consolidated and developed. He said that the friendly visit of the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country will further enhance the close friendship and close unity between the people of the two countries.

Next, Vice Chairman Lin Boqu and Chairman Sangbu delivered speeches full of friendship one after another.

Lin Boqu said that in just a few days, we have visited Mongolia's factories, farms, ranches, cooperatives, and cultural facilities, and have extensively contacted workers, herdsmen, and people from all walks of life, who are carrying out comprehensive socialist construction with high labor enthusiasm. We have seen Mongolia's tremendous achievements and thriving scene over the past thirty-eight years.

He said that in the past ten years, the friendly mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries in political, economic, cultural and other fields has been developing and expanding day by day, which has not only accelerated the socialist construction of the two countries but also strengthened the unity and strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Comrade Lin Boqu said that the Chinese people are now continuing to leap forward under the illumination of the Party's general line, and are striving to complete the main targets of the second five-year plan ahead of schedule this year. He said that in the struggle to build socialism and defend world peace, the Chinese and Mongolian people will surely continue to achieve brilliant results.

Hungarian Ambassador to Mongolia, Galashen, on behalf of the diplomatic corps, wished the Chinese people greater achievements in implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, in continuing to leap forward, and in socialist construction.

    林伯渠同志说，中国人民现在正在党的总路线的照耀下继续跃进，为在今年内提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的战斗任务而奋斗。他说，在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中，中蒙两国人民一定能不断取得光辉灿烂的成果。
