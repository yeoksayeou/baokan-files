Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 16th: Having just concluded the bountiful summer harvest, Czechoslovak farmers have plunged into the autumn harvest and planting season. In order to secure an even greater agricultural harvest next year, this autumn will be busier than usual. Farmers will not only strive to harvest potatoes, sugar beets, and other crops and cut green fodder in a timely manner within half a month to twenty days, but also promptly plow the land and sow winter wheat. At the same time, a mass movement to undertake large-scale farmland water conservancy projects will be launched more extensively throughout the country.

Since the start of the autumn harvest, the weather in Czechoslovakia has been sunny, and the harvesting of green fodder such as corn has progressed very rapidly. Currently, agricultural production cooperatives nationwide have harvested more than one-third of their green fodder, and state farms have harvested about one-quarter. Potatoes, one of the main food sources for the Czechoslovak people, have yielded a very good harvest this year, expected to increase by 30% compared to last year. The joy of the bumper harvest is inspiring the farmers' enthusiasm for production, and they are seizing the time to harvest and store the crops quickly and strive to complete the state's purchasing tasks by the end of September. The harvesting of hops, which the Czechoslovak people call "white gold," has been completed, making it the fastest harvest since liberation, with a yield 10% to 12% higher than last year.

While harvesting, farmers have also begun other autumn agricultural tasks. Much land has already begun to be plowed, and the sowing of winter wheat and autumn-sown forage crops is also being carried out in a timely manner, taking advantage of the current good weather. With the arrival of autumn sowing, the mass movement across the country to strive for an even greater agricultural harvest next year has reached a new high tide. Since the agricultural production cooperative in Přerov County proposed to strive for a 9.75% increase in agricultural production next year and issued its call, half of the agricultural production cooperatives and 46 state farms across the country have responded.

Farmers have demonstrated great enthusiasm in the movement to undertake large-scale farmland water conservancy projects and improve the soil. Pilsen Region recently launched a "100,000 Soil Improvement Voluntary Labor Teams" movement, in which not only farmers but also many workers and students participated in voluntary labor to support this work. Next year, 3,000 hectares of land in this region will be drained and irrigated. In the Slovak region, 531 water conservancy projects are currently under construction, many of which are small-scale water conservancy projects built by the agricultural production cooperatives themselves. Soil improvement cooperatives are springing up like mushrooms after rain across the country. It is expected that this year's soil improvement workload will be overfulfilled by 45%.

Completing this year's autumn agricultural work is an important start to ensuring further improvement in next year's agricultural production. To this end, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government are vigorously grasping the leadership of this year's autumn agricultural work. Recently, the "Red Rights Newspaper" published an editorial criticizing the conservative thinking existing among some members of agricultural production cooperatives and calling on all farmers to wage a resolute struggle against conservative thinking. The editorial stated that it is necessary to prevent the tendency to resign oneself to fate and let things drift when faced with difficulties. The editorial also called for vigorously developing the socialist emulation movement and striving for agricultural production to take another step forward this autumn.

    秋收秋播战斗紧张　大搞水利改良土壤
    捷农民积极争取明年更大丰收
    新华社布拉格16日电　刚刚结束了夏季的丰收，捷克斯洛伐克农民又投入了秋收秋播的战斗。为了获得明年农业生产的更大丰收，今年秋天将比往年更加繁忙，农民们不但要争取在半个月到二十天内收获完马铃薯、甜菜等作物，及时割完青饲料，此外，还要及时翻地和播种冬麦。同时，全国各地将更加广泛地开展一个大搞农田水利的群众性运动。
    秋收开始以来，捷克斯洛伐克各地天气晴朗，玉蜀黍等青饲料的收获工作进展得十分迅速，目前全国农业生产合作社已经收割了三分之一以上的青饲料，国营农场收割了约四分之一。作为捷克斯洛伐克人民主要食品之一的马铃薯，今年收成很好，预计将比去年增产30％。丰收的喜悦鼓舞着农民们的生产热情，他们正抓紧时间快收快藏，并争取在9月底全部完成国家的收购任务。捷克斯洛伐克人民称之为“白色的金子”的啤酒花的收获工作已经完成，这是解放以来收获最快的一年，它的收成比去年增加了10％至12％。
    在秋收的同时，农民们也开始进行其它的秋季农事工作。许多土地已开始翻耕，冬麦和秋播饲料作物的播种也趁着目前的好天气及时进行。随着秋播工作的到来，遍及全国的争取明年农业更大丰收的群众性运动达到了一个新的高潮。自从普累罗夫县的农业生产合作社提出要争取使明年的农业生产增长九点七五的保证和号召以后，全国已有一半农业生产合作社和四十六个国营农场响应了这一号召。
    农民在大搞农田水利和改良土壤的运动中表现了极大的热情，比尔森州最近开展了“十万个改良土壤义务劳动班”的运动，不仅农民，还有许多的工人、学生都进行义务劳动，支援这一工作。这个州明年将有三千公顷的土地得到排水和灌溉。在斯洛伐克地区，目前有五百三十一项水利工程正在动工兴建，其中有许多是农业生产合作社自己兴建的小型水利工程。土壤改良合作社更是像雨后春笋一般在全国各地涌现出来。预计今年的土壤改良工作量将以45％超额完成。
    完成今年秋季农业工作是保证明年农业生产进一步提高的重要开端。为此，捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府正大力抓紧对今年秋季农业工作的领导。最近，“红色权利报”曾发表社论，批判了在一部分农业生产合作社社员中存在的保守思想，并号召全体农民对保守思想进行坚决的斗争。社论说，必须防止那种在困难面前听天由命和放手不管的倾向。社论还要求大力开展社会主义竞赛运动，争取农业生产在今年秋季再向前迈进一步。
