    Embodying the Communist Spirit of Collaboration
    Various Regions Transfer Seeds to Support Disaster Areas

    (Reported by our newspaper) Since the beginning of summer, many regions have experienced varying degrees of drought and flood disasters. Eight provinces (and cities), including Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hunan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Beijing, and Shanghai, have fully demonstrated the spirit of national coordination and have supported disaster areas with 20 million *jin* of buckwheat and vegetable seeds for replanting and changing crops. These seeds have been transferred to Hubei, Henan, Hebei, and other places.

    This year, the allocation and transportation of seeds to support disaster areas have been relatively timely. After the disaster-stricken provinces began to make requests at the end of July, the basic transfer was completed in just half a month. The rapid progress of seed transfer is inseparable from the importance attached to it by the Party and government leaders of the exporting provinces and cities. For example, Beijing, Hunan, and Shanxi, which exported buckwheat seeds, although they also suffered from drought and flood disasters, were still able to supply 4.4 million *jin* to Henan and Hubei provinces, in the spirit of lighter disaster areas supporting more severely affected areas.

    In addition to actively seeking seed sources, the agricultural departments of Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning provinces also dispatched cadres to assist the importing provinces in the selection and inspection of seeds; the railway departments also actively arranged vehicles to accelerate the emergency transport; the grain departments not only provided seed sources but also strengthened the allocation work.

    发挥共产主义协作精神
    各地调运种子支援灾区
    本报讯　入夏以来，不少地区发生了程度不同的旱、涝灾害。内蒙古、黑龙江、辽宁、湖南、山西、江苏、北京、上海等八个省（市），充分发挥了全国一盘棋的协作精神，支援灾区抢种、改种的荞麦、蔬菜种子已达二千万斤。这些种子已分别调往湖北、河南、河北等地。
    今年支援灾区的种子，调拨和发运工作都比较及时。7月底，受灾省开始提出要求后，仅仅半个月时间就基本调运完毕。种子调运进度这样快，是与调出的省、市的党、政领导重视分不开的。如调出荞麦种子的北京、湖南、山西虽也遭受旱、涝灾害，但仍能本着轻灾区支援重灾区的精神，设法供应了河南、湖北两省四百四十万斤。
    内蒙古、黑龙江、辽宁等省的农业部门除积极寻找种源外，还抽调干部协助调入省进行种子的挑选和检验工作；铁道部门也积极安排车辆，加速抢运；粮食部门一方面提供种源，同时又加强了调拨工作。
