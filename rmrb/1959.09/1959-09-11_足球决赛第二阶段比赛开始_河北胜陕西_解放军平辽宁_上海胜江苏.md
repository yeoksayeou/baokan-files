Xinhua News Agency, 10th -- Three football matches were held in Beijing today, kicking off the second stage of the First National Games football finals. As a result, Hebei team defeated Shaanxi team three to zero, the People's Liberation Army team tied Liaoning team zero to zero, and Shanghai team defeated Jiangsu team one to zero.

The second stage of the football finals is divided into two groups. From today until September 27, each team in the same group will play fifteen round-robin matches, and the final ranking will be determined then.

In today's matches, the competition between the PLA team and the Liaoning team, which are relatively close in strength, attracted the most attention. Most of the players on these two teams have been participating in football for a long time and are seasoned veterans. After the kickoff, the PLA team launched a fierce attack, repeatedly penetrating the Liaoning team's penalty area. However, they encountered Liaoning team's tactic of adopting a dense defense and waiting for opportunities to counterattack, sometimes pulling the two wings of the forwards into the penalty area to form a solid defense line. The PLA's forward line faced the opponent's dense defense and did not have many solutions. The two sides eventually tied zero to zero.

The young Shaanxi team lost to the domestically renowned strong team Hebei team by zero to three. All three goals were scored by Hebei team forward Chen Shanhu. Facing a strong opponent, the Shaanxi team was not discouraged and often seized opportunities to fight back, but their shooting skills were not hard enough, and they were all saved by the opponent.

The Jiangsu team was full of energy today and played quite well. It was not until just before the end of the game that they conceded a goal to the Shanghai team.

    足球决赛第二阶段比赛开始
    河北胜陕西　解放军平辽宁　上海胜江苏
    据新华社10日讯　今天在北京举行了三场足球比赛，揭开了第一届全国运动会足球第二段决赛的帷幕。结果河北队以三比零胜陕西队，解放军队与辽宁队零比零踢成平局，上海队以一比零胜江苏队。
    足球第二段决赛分两组举行。从今天起到9月27日，同组各队之间要进行十五场循环赛，最后名次才能分晓。
    今天的比赛，以实力比较接近的解放军队对辽宁队一场竞争最引人注意。这两队的队员们大部分是参加足球运动时间较久，身经百战的选手。开球后，解放军队展开猛攻，一再深入辽宁队禁区。但是，他们遇到辽宁队采取密集防守、伺机出击的战术，有时把前锋两翼也拉到禁区内结成牢固的防线。解放军队锋线面临对方密集防守，办法不多。双方终以零比零告平。
    年轻的陕西队以零比三输给国内知名的劲旅河北队。三球都是由河北队前锋陈山虎射进。陕西队面临强手，毫不气馁，常常伺机奋起反击，可是脚头功夫不够硬，都被对方救出。
    江苏队今天干劲充沛，踢得相当出色，直到临终场前，才被上海队踢进一球。
