Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held a national on-site conference on vertical kilns in Anshan, calling on employees in the national refractory materials sector to vigorously increase the production and quality of magnesite, magnesia bricks, and dolomite, to ensure the national steel production target of 12 million tons this year.

The conference pointed out that magnesite, magnesia bricks, and dolomite are essential high-grade refractory materials for steelmaking. Each ton of open-hearth steel requires 30 to 40 kilograms of magnesite and magnesia bricks, and a dozen kilograms of dolomite; each ton of converter steel requires 7 to 10 kilograms of magnesite and 90 to 100 kilograms of dolomite. Therefore, increased production of magnesite and dolomite is directly related to the increase in China's steel production.

At the conference, representatives from various regions unanimously expressed their intention to promote the experience of No. 10 vertical kiln at the Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel. This vertical kiln, through continuous technological innovation, has created a complete set of advanced operational experiences, resulting in a kiln utilization coefficient (the output per cubic meter of kiln volume per day and night) as high as 1.75. If the utilization coefficient of all vertical kilns in the country approaches or reaches the level of No. 10 vertical kiln, then the national vertical kiln production could potentially increase by more than 50% on the existing basis, and product quality could also be improved.

After discussion, the conference formulated twelve measures to ensure high yield and high quality in vertical kilns. The conference was held from September 2nd to 5th at the Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine near Anshan. During the conference, more than 100 representatives from over 30 units across the country exchanged experiences and visited the technical demonstration of No. 10 vertical kiln at the Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine. All the representatives issued a letter of proposal to the employees on the national magnesite and dolomite production front.

    革新技术多产耐火材料
    冶金部推广鞍钢大石桥镁矿生产经验
    据新华社鞍山7日电　冶金工业部在鞍山召开的全国竖窑现场会议，号召全国耐火材料部门职工大力提高镁砂、镁砖和白云石的产量和质量，以保证全国今年生产一千二百万吨钢的需要。
    会议指出，镁砂、镁砖和白云石，是炼钢必不可少的重要的高级耐火材料。一吨平炉钢需要三十到四十公斤的镁砂和镁砖，十几公斤的白云石；一吨转炉钢，需要七到十公斤镁砂和九十到一百公斤白云石。因此，镁砂和白云石的增产，直接关系着我国钢的增产。
    在这次会议上，各地代表一致表示要推广鞍钢大石桥镁矿十号竖窑的经验。这座竖窑由于不断革新技术，创造了一整套先进的操作经验，使窑的利用系数（每立方米窑的容积一昼夜的产量）高达一点七五。如果全国竖窑的利用系数都接近或达到十号竖窑的水平，那末全国竖窑生产量在现有基础上就有可能增加50％以上，产品质量也可提高。
    会议经过讨论，拟订了保证竖窑高产优质的十二项措施。这次会议是在9月2日到5日在鞍山附近的大石桥镁矿举行的。会议期间，来自全国三十多个单位的一百多名代表，互相交流了经验，参观了大石桥镁矿十号竖窑的技术表演。全体代表向全国镁砂、白云石生产战线上的职工发出了倡议书。
