Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, issued a statement on August 30th regarding the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC. He said that this year, China will complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Carrying out socialist construction at such a high speed fully conforms to the greatest interests and urgent desires of the 650 million people. He said: I fully support this great call made by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong.

Chen Jiageng said: The vast number of overseas Chinese have always eagerly hoped that the motherland will become a prosperous and strong industrial country. Now, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, this wish can be realized more quickly. The slogan of "catching up with the UK in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years" put forward in the past, now has the possibility of being basically realized in about ten years. I believe that overseas Chinese will feel the greatness and loveliness of the motherland even more, and thus support and love the motherland even more.

Chen Jiageng said that since the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao put forward the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" last year, an unprecedented Great Leap Forward situation emerged in 1958, and this year's total industrial output value will increase by 25.5% compared with last year's Great Leap Forward, and the total agricultural output value will also increase by 10%. Such a rapid rate of growth is naturally something that those who are hostile to the new China in capitalist countries can only sigh in vain about.

Chen Jiageng said that people's communes, like the rising sun, emitted boundless light from the vast land of China last year and played a well-known powerful role in agricultural production last year. In the recent struggle to overcome floods, droughts, and insect pests, the great role of the people's communes has become even more significant. No matter how the foreign reactionaries curse it, it will never be cursed down.

Chen Jiageng finally said that I believe that the 650 million people of our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, will hold high the glorious banners of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, and will certainly be able to complete and over fulfill this year's national economic plan, and will certainly be able to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year.

    归国华侨联合会主席陈嘉庚发表谈话
    完全拥护中共八届八中全会决议
    据新华社31日讯　中华全国归国华侨联合会主席陈嘉庚30日就中共八届八中全会的公报和决议发表谈话说，今年内，我国要提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。以这样高的速度进行社会主义建设，完全符合六亿五千万人民的最大利益和迫切愿望。他说：我完全拥护中国共产党和毛泽东主席提出的这个伟大号召。
    陈嘉庚说：国外广大华侨一向殷切盼望祖国成为一个富强的工业国家。现在，这一愿望在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导之下，可以更为迅速地实现了。过去提出要“在十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平”的口号，现在有可能争取在十年左右的时间内基本实现，我相信海外华侨将更加感觉到祖国的伟大可爱，从而更加拥护和热爱祖国。
    陈嘉庚说，自从中国共产党和毛主席在去年提出鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线后，1958年出现了史无前例的大跃进局面，而今年的工业总产值将比特大跃进的去年增长25.5％，农业总产值也将增长10％。这样快的增长速度，对于资本主义国家中敌视新中国的人们，自然是只能望洋兴叹的。
    陈嘉庚说，人民公社在去年从中国广大土地上，像旭日东升一样发出了万丈光芒，在去年的农业生产上，发挥了人所共知的威力。在最近的战胜水旱虫灾的斗争中，人民公社的巨大作用更加显著。不管国外的反动派对它如何诅咒，它总是诅咒不倒的。
    陈嘉庚最后说，我相信，我国六亿五千万人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，高高举起大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜，一定能够完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划，一定能够在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。
