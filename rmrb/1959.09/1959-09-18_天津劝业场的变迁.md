    At the intersection of Heping Road and Binjiang Road in Tianjin, stands a seven-story building. At night, neon lights shine brightly, and the five-pointed red star on the roof sparkles. This is the well-known Tianjin Quanyechang (勸業場).

    Every day, tens of thousands of customers flock to this shopping center to select their favorite goods. Nearly 20,000 kinds of goods are displayed here. People can buy anything from needles, threads, and dress hooks costing a few cents to various valuable wool fabrics, silks, antiques, jewelry, radios, watches, and other high-end goods. People can also repair radios, clocks, fountain pens, and electric lights here. They can also take the elevator to the fifth floor to watch plays and movies. On summer nights, the rooftop on the sixth floor is another world: the "Tianwaitian" (天外天) amusement park, decorated with various blooming potted flowers, allows people to enjoy cold snacks, drink tea, enjoy the cool breeze, watch various cultural performances, or enjoy a panoramic view of the city lights, spending a pleasant evening.

    The Man-Eating Tiger "Tiger Stall"

    Quanyechang was built in 1928. At that time, the greedy mouths of imperialists were reaching into our suffering motherland. A pot-bellied comprador capitalist in Tianjin, with the support of imperialists and feudal bureaucrats, built this shopping center. The British sold him the land, the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China lent him money, the French helped him design it, and the feudal bureaucrats also invested a large sum of money. It is said that building Quanyechang was meant to encourage people to engage in commerce, but in reality, it was a place where imperialists, comprador capitalists, and feudal forces joined together to exploit the Chinese people. Here, one could see a tragic scene of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. More than 160 large and small businesses in the mall operated various imported goods. Hollywood pin-up pictures and various pornographic images filled the windows. The goods included expensive French Blanc de Sèvres perfume, American glass stockings, various cosmetics, opium paraphernalia, mahjong tiles, songbirds, crickets, katydids, as well as jewelry and other ornaments worn by ladies and misses. Entering the shopping center, one was met with fraud, oppression, exploitation, and sin. Capitalists tried every means to deceive customers. Merchants dealing in jewelry and antiques were notorious swindlers. They "buy low and sell high," "not opening for business for a year, but eating for a year once they do." They would coat yellow diamonds with chemicals to turn them into dazzling diamonds, selling them for dozens of times their original price. ... Quanyechang at that time was truly a man-eating "Tiger Stall." Even shrewd people could not avoid being taken advantage of here.

    Tear Down the "Pigeon Coops"!

    Transforming this tiger stall was a sharp struggle.

    In the early days after liberation, some people were still engaged in speculation here. They resold gold, evaded taxes, and continued to engage in deception to cheat customers. Under the leadership of the Party, the mall's employees first launched a struggle with the capitalists to achieve clearly marked prices, and organized an evaluation committee to fairly assess the prices of various goods. This openly tore off the swindlers' so-called "genuine goods at fair prices" masks. In the tumultuous "Five-Anti" movement in 1952, the vast majority of shop assistants, united around the Party, repelled the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks. Subsequently, with the successive victories of the state's policy of transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and driven by the unprecedented rise in the socialist enthusiasm of all employees, in 1956, the entire shopping center implemented joint public-private ownership, fundamentally changing the relations of production. Following this, the Party organization of the shopping center led the employees in a series of enterprise reforms and shopping center construction.

    Tearing down the pigeon coops – this was the first important transformation after the joint public-private ownership of the mall. Originally, more than 160 large and small capitalists in the mall "occupied their own areas," setting up their own stalls, separated from each other by wooden boards, layer upon layer, stall upon stall, dark and dingy, filled with foul air!

    Now, when people enter the mall, it is truly bright, clean, and refreshing. The state has invested more than 4 million yuan in this joint venture, adding variety to the goods and replenishing the supply. The variety of goods handled has increased from more than 4,900 at the time of the joint venture to more than 19,000. The mall's turnover has been increasing continuously, and the average monthly turnover is equivalent to thirteen or fourteen times that of January 1956, before the joint venture.

    Everything is for Customer Service

    Habitual forces are the most stubborn forces, and changing the old ways of doing things that had been left over for decades is not a simple matter. However, the education and influence of the Communist Party have enabled more than 400 people in the entire mall to recognize the dangers of the old business practices of the past and to be determined to change them.

    Here, the relationship between salespersons and customers is not only a genuine buying and selling relationship, but also a completely new service relationship. Salespersons try every means to provide better service to customers, allowing them to buy things that they are satisfied with. The tumultuous "Five Satisfactions" movement, the "Five Good" Red Flag competition movement… unfolded one after another.

    Salespersons not only try every means to make it convenient for customers to buy things, but also warmly care for people. A blind customer came to the stationery department to buy envelopes and stationery. The salesperson Sun Fenglou helped him sit down, took seven or eight kinds of envelopes and stationery for him to feel with his hands, and also introduced the specifications and prices to him. When Sun Fenglou wrapped up what he bought and sent him downstairs, he grabbed the customer next to him and asked him to write down a commendation on his behalf. He said excitedly to Sun Fenglou: "Although I can't see your face, your attitude towards people is something I will never forget!"

    Since the beginning of this year, customers have written more than 39,000 commendations in the opinion books, and salespersons have been given more than 70,000 small red flags. A farmer from the countryside, Qi Yongzhi, wrote an enthusiastic poem in the opinion book:
      "Quanyechang, oh Quanyechang, I heard you've changed in the countryside,
    Today I came here to visit, Everywhere is clean and bright,
    Salespersons are kind and friendly, Fair trade and polite,
    A good shopping center led by Chairman Mao, Coming here is like coming home."

    What could be more pleasing than winning the trust of the people? The "Tiger Stall" of the old society has become a "Home for Customers" in the new society. What a huge change this is, how can one not be amazed by the Party's great transformative power when looking at the current Quanyechang!

    天津劝业场的变迁
    新华社记者　吕素瑄　黄军
    天津市和平路、滨江道的十字路口，座落着一个七层大厦。入夜，霓虹灯光辉四射，楼顶上的五角红星闪闪发光。这里就是远近闻名的天津劝业场。
    每天，数万名顾客川流不息地来到这个商场，选购自己喜爱的商品。这里，陈列着近两万种商品。人们可以买到从一分钱的针、线、领钩到各种贵重的呢绒、绸缎、古玩、珠宝、收音机、手表等等高级商品；人们还可以在这里修理收音机、钟表、金笔、电灯等物品。还可以乘电梯登上五楼看戏看电影。在夏季的夜晚，六楼楼顶又是另一种境界：用各种盛开的盆花点缀得花团锦簇的“天外天”游艺场，人们在这里可以吃着冷食、喝着清茶，迎着凉风，看着各种文艺节目，或者鸟瞰万家灯火的夜景，度过愉快的夜晚。
    吃人的老虎“老虎摊”
    劝业场兴建于1928年。那时，帝国主义贪馋的猪嘴正伸向苦难的祖国，天津一位大腹便便的买办资本家在帝国主义和封建官僚扶植下，兴建了这座商场。英国人卖给他地皮，麦加利银行贷给他款子，法国人帮他设计，封建官僚也投入了一大笔资金。据说，兴建劝业场是劝人们兴办商业的意思，实际上是帝国主义、买办资本家和封建势力三位一体压榨中国人民的场所。在这里，可以看到一幅半殖民地、半封建的悲惨景象。场内一百六十多家大小商户，经营各色各样的进口商品，好莱坞的大腿画、各种黄色画片充满橱窗。商品中有价值高昂的法国白衣人牌香水、美国玻璃长统丝袜、各种化装品；有鸦片烟具、麻将牌、画眉鸟、蟋蟀、蝈蝈，以及太太小姐们戴的珠宝等装饰品。走进商场，到处充满了欺诈、压迫、剥削和罪恶。资本家们千方百计欺骗顾客。经营珠宝古玩的商户更是有名的骗子手。他们“压价收，高价卖”“一年不开张，开张吃一年”。他们把颜色黄的钻石涂上药水，变成一颗光芒四射的钻石，售价高出原价数十倍。……那时的劝业场真是吃人的“老虎摊”。精明的人到了这里也难免大触霉头。
    拆掉“鸽子窝”！
    改造这个老虎摊是一场尖锐的斗争。
    解放初期，这里仍然有人搞投机活动。他们倒卖黄金，偷税漏税，并且继续弄虚作假，欺骗顾客。商场的职工在党的领导下，首先和资本家展开了争取明码实价的斗争，组织了评价委员会，公正地评议各种商品的售价。这就公开地撕毁了骗子们所谓“货真价实”的假面具。1952年轰轰烈烈的“五反”运动，广大店员们又团结在党的周围，打退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻。此后，随着国家对资本主义工商业改造政策的节节胜利，在全体职工社会主义积极性空前高涨的推动下，1956年，全商场实行了公私合营，从根本上改变了生产关系。接着，商场的党组织领导职工进行了一系列的企业改造和商场建设。
    拆掉鸽子窝——这是商场公私合营以后第一个重要改造。原来，商场内的一百六十多个大大小小的资本家，“各据一方”，自设一摊，相互用木板隔起来，从下到上，一层层，一摊摊，黑格洞洞，乌烟瘴气！
    现在，人们走进商场，真是窗明几净，气象清新。国家向这个合营企业投资四百多万元，增添花色品种，充实货源。经营的商品品种由合营时的四千九百多种，增加到一万九千多种。商场营业额不断上升，平均每月的营业额相当于1956年合营前的1月份的十三、四倍。
    一切为顾客服务
    习惯势力是最顽强的势力，要改变几十年遗留下的旧作风，不是一件简单的事情。然而，共产党的教育和感化却使全场四百多名人员，认清了过去旧的经营作风的危险性，决心改变这种旧作风。
    在这里售货员和顾客之间，不仅是货真价实的买卖关系，而且是全新的服务关系。售货员们想尽一切办法，为顾客服务的更好，让顾客买到称心如意的东西。轰轰烈烈的“五满意”运动，“五好”红旗竞赛运动……一个接着一个展开。
    售货员们不仅千方百计让顾客买东西方便，而且热情地关怀人。一位双目失明的顾客来到文具部买信封信纸，售货员孙风楼扶他坐下后，拿了七、八种信封信纸让他用手摸，一面又把规格、价钱介绍给他。当孙风楼给他包好买到的东西送他下楼时，他拉住旁边的顾客要求代他写下表扬意见，他激动地对孙风楼说：“虽然我看不到你的面貌，但是你待人的态度是我永远不能忘记的！”
    今年以来，顾客在意见簿上写下的表扬意见就有三万九千多件，给售货员插的小红旗有七万多个。一位来自农村的农民齐永芝在意见簿上写了一首热情洋溢的诗篇：
      “劝业场呀劝业场，在乡下听说你变了样，
    今天到这里来观光，到处是清洁亮堂堂，
    售货员和蔼又亲切，买卖公道礼貌强，
    毛主席领导的好商场，到这儿好比到家乡。”
    有什么事情比博得人民的信任更叫人高兴呢？旧社会的“老虎摊”，新社会成了“顾客之家”。这是多么巨大的变化，看看现在的劝业场怎么不令人惊叹党的巨大的改造力量！
