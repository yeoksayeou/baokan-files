Xinhua News Agency, September 17th. The Ninth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress was held on the afternoon of the 17th. The meeting discussed the proposal made by Chairman Mao Zedong on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding amnesty for war criminals, counter-revolutionary criminals, and ordinary criminal offenders who have genuinely reformed. The meeting unanimously approved the proposal and decided that, in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, amnesty will be granted to war criminals, counter-revolutionary criminals, and ordinary criminal offenders from the Chiang Kai-shek Group and the puppet Manchukuo who have undergone a certain period of labor reform and have genuinely reformed themselves.

The meeting first read the proposal made by Chairman Mao Zedong on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding amnesty for a group of war criminals, counter-revolutionary criminals, and ordinary criminal offenders who have genuinely reformed. The proposal stated: "The Party and the People's Government's policy of combining punishment and leniency, labor reform and ideological education towards counter-revolutionaries and other criminals has achieved great success. The majority of various criminals in custody have undergone varying degrees of reform, and many have genuinely turned over a new leaf. In light of this situation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that it is appropriate to announce an amnesty for a group of war criminals, counter-revolutionary criminals, and ordinary criminal offenders who have genuinely reformed in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China. Taking this measure will be more conducive to transforming negative factors into positive ones and will have a significant educational effect on the continued reform of these criminals and other criminals in custody. This will make them feel that under our great socialist system, as long as they turn over a new leaf, they all have a future."

After discussion, the meeting unanimously approved the proposal and passed the "Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Amnesty for Criminals Who Have Genuinely Reformed."

Based on the proposal of the State Council, the meeting decided to appoint Vice Premier Lin Biao concurrently as Minister of National Defense, and to remove Vice Premier Peng Dehuai from the concurrent post of Minister of National Defense; to appoint Vice Premier Luo Ruiqing concurrently as Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and to remove Huang Kecheng from the post of Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; to appoint Xie Fuzhi as Minister of Public Security, and to remove Vice Premier Luo Ruiqing from the concurrent post of Minister of Public Security.

The meeting also discussed and passed the "Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Municipalities Directly Under the Central Government and Larger Cities May Lead Counties and Autonomous Counties."

The meeting appointed Wang Weigang as Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, and also approved other appointments and removals.

    全国人民代表大会常委会同意中共中央的建议并决定
    特赦一批确已改恶从善的罪犯
    新华社17日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会17日下午举行第九次会议。会议讨论了毛泽东主席所提出的中国共产党中央委员会关于特赦确实已经改恶从善的战争罪犯、反革命罪犯和普通刑事罪犯的建议。会议一致同意这个建议。并且决定：在庆祝伟大的中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，对于经过一定期间的劳动改造、确实改恶从善的蒋介石集团和伪满洲国的战争罪犯、反革命罪犯和普通刑事罪犯，实行特赦。
    会议首先宣读了毛泽东主席提出的中国共产党中央委员会关于特赦一批确实已经改恶从善的战争罪犯、反革命罪犯和普通刑事罪犯的建议。这个建议说：“党和人民政府对反革命分子和其他罪犯实行的惩办和宽大相结合、劳动改造和思想教育相结合的政策，已经获得伟大的成绩。在押各种罪犯中的多数已经得到不同程度的改造，有不少人确实已经改恶从善。根据这种情况，中国共产党中央委员会认为，在庆祝伟大的中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，对于一批确实已经改恶从善的战争罪犯、反革命罪犯和普通刑事罪犯，宣布实行特赦是适宜的。采取这个措施，将更有利于化消极因素为积极因素，对于这些罪犯和其他在押罪犯的继续改造，都有重大的教育作用。这将使他们感到在我们伟大的社会主义制度下，只要改恶从善，都有自己的前途。”
    会议经过讨论，一致同意这个建议，并且通过了“全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于特赦确实改恶从善的罪犯的决定”。
    会议根据国务院的提请，决定任命林彪副总理兼任国防部部长，免去彭德怀副总理所兼国防部部长的职务；任命罗瑞卿副总理兼任中国人民解放军总参谋长，免去黄克诚中国人民解放军总参谋长的职务；任命谢富治任公安部部长，免去罗瑞卿副总理所兼公安部部长的职务。
    会议还讨论和通过了“全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于直辖市和较大的市可以领导县、自治县的决定”。
    会议任命王维纲为最高人民法院副院长，同时会议还通过了其他任免名单。
