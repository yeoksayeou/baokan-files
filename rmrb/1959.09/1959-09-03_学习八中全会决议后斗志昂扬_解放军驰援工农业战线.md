Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Spurred on by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively participating in and supporting the country's socialist construction.

The troops stationed in the Kunming area recently dispatched more than 2,300 officers and soldiers to form a labor army and went to the construction site of the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant. With the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, they accelerated the construction of the iron and steel plant together with the workers. At the construction site, the officers and soldiers worked hard while seizing the rest time to study the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session. Inspired by the communique and resolutions, the Sixth Company of a certain unit changed the original mixed operation organization into a group assembly line operation, which doubled the work efficiency. A certain unit of the troops stationed in the Chengdu area also sent more than 700 officers and soldiers to support the project of major and medium repairs of open-hearth furnaces of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. When the officers and soldiers were transporting bricks out of the furnace, their gloves were burned through and their hands were blistered, but they still worked tenaciously. They said that they would complete the task as soon as possible so as to produce more steel for the motherland. In Anshan, more than 200 vehicles of a certain automobile regiment of the troops in the Shenyang area have been in a combat posture these days, braving wind and rain, day and night, transporting ore and various building materials from all directions to blast furnaces and construction sites.

More than 5,600 officers and soldiers of the Jinan area troops fighting on the Dongping Lake Reservoir construction site have undertaken the most arduous slope protection project in the reservoir construction, which is 15 kilometers long and requires more than 80,000 cubic meters of stone. At present, in the hot labor competition, they have completed more than 16,000 cubic meters of masonry and stacking tasks, reaching about 20% of the total task. They are determined to strive to complete the construction task of slope protection this year. More than 10,000 officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Beijing area troops who have been working at the Miyun Reservoir for nearly a year recently happily welcomed "double happiness." They studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee while celebrating the successful completion of the first phase of the flood control project.

The officers and soldiers of various troops, full of love for the people's communes, also actively participated in the production labor of the communes, assisted the residents in overcoming disasters, and strived for a bumper autumn harvest. In order to support the people's communes in achieving the goal of increasing grain production, a certain unit of the Yunnan garrison spared time from the tense military training and helped the local people's communes to harvest crops in the rain. They also launched a competition with the broad masses of commune members to compare their energy and quality in labor, making the harvesting work fast and good. In recent days, the officers and soldiers of the three armed forces of the army, navy, and air force on the Fujian front have risen up to support the people's communes along the coast in combating disasters and restoring production. When the Xiamen Front People's Commune needed fertilizer to rescue crops soaked in seawater, the troops stationed nearby immediately sent them the fertilizer they had prepared for their own production. The Tatou People's Commune mobilized the labor force of the whole commune to prepare to repair a section of the highway that was damaged by the waves, and the nearby garrison immediately took over this major task. Many troops also spared manpower and material resources to help the communes repair houses and rescue materials. Now, with the strong support of the commanders and fighters, most of the crops that can be rescued by the people's communes have been rescued. Most of the houses of the commune members that were less damaged have also been repaired. A scene of the military and civilians jointly seizing the autumn harvest has emerged on the coastal defense line. (Attached photo)

After studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army have been greatly motivated. They are determined to step up training and prepare to accept the review of the Party and state leaders on the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

    学习八中全会决议后斗志昂扬
    解放军驰援工农业战线
    据新华社2日讯　中国人民解放军广大官兵在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，积极参加和支援国家社会主义建设。
    驻昆明地区的部队，最近派出两千三百多名官兵，组成劳动大军，开赴昆明钢铁厂建设工地，以苦干、实干、巧干的精神，和工人一起，加速钢铁厂的建设。在工地上，官兵们一面紧张的劳动，一面抓紧休息时间，学习八中全会的公报和决议。某部六连在公报和决议的鼓舞下，把原来的混合作业组织改变为分组流水作业，提高工效两倍。驻成都地区部队某部，也派出七百多名官兵，支援重庆钢铁公司大、中修平炉的工程。官兵们在炉膛里向外运送砖时，手套烫破了，手也烫起了泡，仍然顽强地劳动着，他们表示：要早日完成任务，好为祖国炼出更多的钢。在鞍山，沈阳地区部队某汽车团的二百多辆汽车，这几天也是以战斗姿态，风雨不误，日夜兼程，把矿砂和各种建筑材料，从四面八方运往高炉和建筑工地。
    正在东平湖水库工地上战斗的济南地区部队五千六百多名官兵担负了水库建设中最艰巨的护坡工程，全长十五公里、约需石料八万余立方。目前，他们在火热的劳动竞赛中，已完成了砌、垒任务一万六千余立方，达到总任务20％左右。他们决心争取今年完成护坡的建筑任务。在密云水库劳动了将近一年的北京地区部队某部一万多名官兵，最近喜气洋洋地迎接“双喜临门”，他们一面学习八届八中全会的文件，一面庆祝第一期拦洪工程胜利完成。
    各部队官兵，还满怀着热爱人民公社的心情，积极参加了公社的生产劳动，协助居民战胜灾害，争取秋季大丰收。云南驻军某部，为了支援人民公社实现粮食增产的指标，在紧张的军事训练中，抽出时间，冒雨帮助驻地人民公社抢收庄稼，并在劳动中同广大社员展开比干劲、比质量的竞赛，使收获工作做得又快又好。福建前线陆、海、空三军部队的官兵，连日来奋起支援沿海人民公社抢险救灾，恢复生产。厦门前线人民公社在抢救海水浸的农作物时需要肥料，驻在附近的部队立即把准备自己生产用的肥料送给他们。塔头人民公社动员全社劳动力准备抢修一段被海浪冲坏的公路，附近的驻军马上把这一重大任务包下来。许多部队还抽出人力和物力帮助公社修补房屋、抢救物资。现在，在指战员们的大力支援下，各人民公社能够抢救的农作物都已绝大部分抢救了出来。破坏较轻的社员房屋也大部分修好。海防线上展现出一片军民共夺秋季丰收的景象。（附图片）
    解放军某部官兵，学习了党的八中全会决议后，干劲倍增。他们决心加紧训练，准备在国庆十周年接受党和国家领导人的检阅。这是该部政委张海毛大尉，在组织干部学习八中全会文件的情形　牛嵩林摄
