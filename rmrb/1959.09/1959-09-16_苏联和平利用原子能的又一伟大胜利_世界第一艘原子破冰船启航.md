Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: Leningrad News: The Soviet Union's world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker, the "Lenin," officially began its maiden voyage from the Neva River this morning.

This icebreaker belongs to the Soviet Northern Shipping Fleet and will travel through the Baltic Sea to the Arctic region.

The "Lenin" icebreaker left the shipyard on the 12th and docked on the Neva River in Leningrad for three days. Its official maiden voyage is another great victory for the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

The Performance of the Soviet Nuclear Icebreaker

The Soviet Union's world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker, the "Lenin," has set sail. From now on, it will open up a navigable route for Soviet cargo fleets in the vast ice and snow world along the more than 10,000-kilometer-long route in the Soviet Arctic region.

How Does a Nuclear Icebreaker Break Ice?

How does an icebreaker carry out icebreaking work? It turns out that the bow, stern, and port and starboard sides of the hull of the icebreaker are equipped with large water tanks. Using powerful water pumps, seawater can be quickly filled into any water tank, or water can be pumped out of the water tank. Because the icebreaker has a deep draft and high horsepower, and the bow is sharp and hard, thinner ice layers cannot stop it from moving forward. When it encounters thick ice layers that it cannot break through, the ship's management personnel turn on the water pumps and fill the stern water tank. As the center of gravity of the entire ship shifts backward, the bow is raised (usually raised two degrees). At this time, the hull moves forward slightly, and the bow presses on the thick ice layer. Then, the management personnel pump the water out of the stern water tank and fill the bow water tank, and the ship's center of gravity shifts forward. In this way, even ice layers as thick as six feet can be quickly crushed by the weight of the bow.

In addition, relying on the swaying of the hull from side to side, the ice layers on both sides of the hull can also be crushed to widen the航路 route. For example, when the water tank on the port side of the hull is filled, the hull tilts to the left (usually tilting five to six degrees), so that the weight of the hull can be used to crush the ice layer on the port side.

What Does the Nuclear Reactor of a Nuclear Icebreaker Look Like?

The type of nuclear reactor used by the icebreaker is a pressurized water type that is safe, reliable, stable in operation, and simple to control. The nuclear fuel it uses is sintered uranium dioxide packaged in zirconium alloy. The core of the reactor is about one meter in diameter and one point six meters high. It is installed in a cylindrical container with a diameter of two meters and a height of about five meters. The container is made of low-alloy high-strength carbon steel and is internally coated with a layer of stainless steel. When the reactor is working, water at a pressure of up to 200 atmospheres flows from the bottom of the container into the container, passes through the reactor, and flows out of the top of the container with huge amounts of heat into two steam boilers, transferring the heat to the water in another system (the water in the two systems does not come into contact with each other), causing it to quickly turn into steam, which drives the turbine generator to generate a large amount of electricity. At this time, the electricity drives the electric motor, which transmits the power to drive the icebreaker and various ancillary equipment.

The high-pressure water that transfers heat has a temperature of 248 degrees Celsius when it flows into the reactor vessel and 325 degrees Celsius when it flows out of the reactor vessel. The steam generated in the steam boiler at 28 atmospheres has a temperature of 310 degrees Celsius.

Why Install Three Nuclear Reactors?

The Soviet Lenin nuclear icebreaker is equipped with three nuclear reactors. Under normal circumstances, installing two would be enough. However, Soviet scientists decided to install a third backup reactor. This is because: when the icebreaker encounters the worst ice conditions and requires maximum horsepower for a long period of time, the staff can start all three reactors at the same time to obtain the maximum horsepower. At the same time, with a third reactor, if one of the three reactors fails, the remaining two reactors can still be started to maintain the normal navigation of the icebreaker. If any of the reactors needs to be overhauled, the other two reactors can continue to operate as usual.

How Does a Nuclear Icebreaker Protect Personnel?

The equipment of the nuclear icebreaker is very comprehensive in protecting personnel from radioactive radiation. Between the nuclear reactor and the place where the staff works, there is a protective wall made of steel, water, and special cement to isolate them. Fixed measuring instruments are installed in the rooms near the reactor and steam boilers. In case the amount of radioactive radiation in the air exceeds the prescribed allowable limit, the alarm devices in the control room and near the entrances of each room will send out warning signals to attract people's attention and prevent them. Personnel working in the boiler section must wear special work clothes, and people must be inspected when they leave the construction site.

In addition, in order to prevent the water in the steam boiler from harming people due to accidental radioactive contamination, the water in the boiler is also stored in special containers. If it is to be released for use or poured into the sea, it must be specially purified so that its radioactivity does not exceed the prescribed allowable limit.

### 苏联和平利用原子能的又一伟大胜利  世界第一艘原子破冰船启航

    苏联和平利用原子能的又一伟大胜利
    世界第一艘原子破冰船启航
    新华社莫斯科15日电　列宁格勒讯：苏联的世界第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”于今天早晨从?瓦河正式开始首次航行。
    这艘破冰船属于苏联北方船航队，它将通过波罗的海开往北极地区。
    “列宁号”破冰船12日离开造船厂后，在列宁格勒市区的?瓦河上停泊了三天。它的正式开航是苏联在和平利用原子能方面的又一个伟大的胜利。
    苏联原子破冰船的性能
    苏联的世界上第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”已经开航了。从此，它将在苏联北极地区一万多公里长的航线上，在茫茫一片的冰雪世界里，为苏联货运船队开辟出一条通航道路来。
    原子破冰船怎样破冰？
    破冰船是怎样进行破冰工作的呢？原来破冰船的船头、船尾和船腹左右两侧都备有很大的水箱，利用强力的水泵，就能很快地把海水灌满任何一个水箱，或是把水从水箱里抽出来。由于破冰船吃水深，马力大，而船头又尖又硬，不太厚的冰层是阻挡不住它的前进的。当它遇到冲不破的厚冰层的时候，船上的管理人员就开动水泵，灌满船尾的水箱。由于整个船的重心后移，船头便抬高起来（通常是抬高二度）。这时，船身稍向前行驶，船头便压在厚冰层上面。接着，管理人员把船尾的水箱里的水抽空，又把船头的水箱灌满，船的重心就前移，这样，即使厚到六尺的冰层也很快会被船头的重力压碎。
    此外，依靠船身的左右摆动，还可以压碎船身两旁的冰层，拓宽航路。例如把船腹左侧的水箱灌满，船身便向左边倾斜（通常倾斜五—六度），这样，就可以依靠船身的重量压碎左侧的冰层。
    原子破冰船的原子反应堆是什么样子？
    破冰船采用的原子反应堆的类型是安全可靠、工作稳定、控制简单的加压水型。它使用的原子燃料是包装在锆合金里的烧结二氧化铀。反应堆的核心直径约一米，高一点六米。它装在一个直径二米、高约五米的圆柱形的容器里，容器是用低合金高强度碳钢制成的，内部还涂着一层不锈钢。当反应堆工作的时候，在高达二百个大气压下的水，就从容器底部流进容器，经过反应堆后带着巨大的热量，从容器的上部流入两个蒸汽锅炉，把热量传给另一个系统中的水（两个系统中的水互不接触），使它迅速变成蒸汽，推动涡轮发电机，发出大量电流。这时，电流再带动电动机，把动力传出去，就可以开动破冰船和各种附属设备了。
    传递热量的高压水在流进反应堆容器时温度是摄氏二百四十八度，出反应堆容器时是摄氏三百二十五度。蒸汽锅炉中产生的在二十八个大气压下的蒸汽是摄氏三百一十度。
    为什么要装三个原子反应堆？
    苏联列宁原子能破冰船上装着三个原子反应堆。根据一般情况，装两个也就够了。但是，苏联科学工作者决定装置第三个储备用的反应堆。这是因为：当破冰船遇到最坏的冰情，在一个很长的时期内需要最大的马力时，工作人员就可以把三个反应堆同时开动，以便获得最大的马力。同时，破冰船有了第三个反应堆，万一遇到三个反应堆中有一个发生故障，仍能开动两个反应堆，保持破冰船的正常航行。如果有任何一个反应堆需要检修，也有两个反应堆可以照常工作。
    原子破冰船如何进行人身防护？
    在防护人身免受放射性辐射侵害方面，原子能破冰船的设备是非常周密的。在原子反应堆和工作人员工作的地方之间，有一道用钢、水和特种水泥制成的防护墙把它们隔离开来。在反应堆和蒸汽锅炉附近的房间里，都装有固定的测量仪器。万一空气中的放射性辐射的数量超过了规定容许的限度，操纵室和各房间进口附近的告警装置便会发出警告的讯号，以引起人们的注意，而加以防范。在锅炉段工作的人员一律穿特制的工作服，人们离开工地时，一定要经过检查。
    此外，为了防止蒸汽锅炉里的水由于万一沾染上放射性而侵害人身，锅炉里的水也盛放在特制的容器里。如果要把它放出来使用或是倒入大海，一定要经过特别的净化处理，使它的放射性不超过规定的容许限度。
