Xinhua News Agency, Berlin. The German Democratic Republic is preparing to welcome the new school year, with the systematic implementation of comprehensive technical education as its central task.

In the new school year beginning September 1st, 63% of the original eight-year school graduates will enter ten-year comprehensive technical secondary schools. According to the instructions of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government, comprehensive technical schools will carry out three main tasks in the new school year: starting systematic teaching of the basic courses of comprehensive technical education; improving the level of teachers; and establishing solid order and discipline in schools.

The comprehensive technical education in the German Democratic Republic began to be implemented last September. In January this year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany summarized the experience of past education work and formulated the "Outline for Further Developing Socialist Schools and the Tasks of Socialist Schools in the Socialist Construction of the German Democratic Republic." The outline stipulates that teaching and socialist practice should be combined through comprehensive technical education. During this year's summer vacation, more than 90% of the schools have prepared to teach the basic courses of comprehensive technical education. These basic courses include four subjects: metal processing, machinery, electrical engineering, and agriculture. In the new school year, a new teaching system based on a complete socialist-oriented teaching plan will appear in the German Democratic Republic, which is the first time in the history of German education.

The implementation of comprehensive technical education will closely link schools with factories, agricultural production cooperatives and other production units.

    德国教育史上的创举
    新学年实施授课新制度
    据新华社柏林电　德意志民主共和国各地正在迎接以系统实行综合技术教育为中心任务的新学年。
    在从9月1日开始的新学年中，将有63％的原八年制学校的毕业生进入十年制的综合技术中学。根据德国统一社会党和政府的指示，综合技术学校在新学年中将执行三项主要任务：开始系统讲授综合技术教育的基本课程；提高教师水平；建立学校的巩固秩序和纪律。
    德意志民主共和国的综合技术教育是从去年9月开始实施的。今年1月，统一社会党四中全会总结了过去教育工作实践的经验，制定了“进一步发展社会主义学校以及社会主义学校在德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设中的任务”的提纲。提纲中规定通过综合技术教育使教学和社会主义实践相结合。在今年暑假期间，已有90％以上的学校做好了讲授综合技术教育基本课程的准备工作。这些基本课程包括金属加工、机械、电机和农业四门。在新学年中，德意志民主共和国将出现一种建立在完整的以社会主义为目标的教学计划的基础上的授课新制度，这在德国教育史上还是第一次。
    综合技术教育的实施将使学校和工厂、农业生产合作社等生产单位发生密切的联系。
