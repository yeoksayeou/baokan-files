    Strive for Continued Leaps Forward in Military Work Under the Glorious Illumination of the General Line
    He Long, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council

    On October 1, 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong solemnly announced the founding of the People's Republic of China to the world. It has been ten years since then. These are glorious ten years, great ten years. In this short historical period, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country rapidly healed the wounds of prolonged war and victoriously carried out socialist revolution and socialist construction. Our country has carried out a comprehensive socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, basically completing the task of socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production. Our people have also carried out a nationwide rectification movement and a struggle against the rightists, achieving a great victory in the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts. In this way, socialism has basically defeated capitalism in all aspects. At the same time, China's socialist construction has also made great progress. The completion and overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan have laid a preliminary foundation for China's socialist industrialization. Since 1958, under the glorious guidance of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the people of the whole country have launched a vigorous and comprehensive great leap forward, and industry, agriculture, and scientific and cultural undertakings have all achieved unprecedented development in history. At present, the Chinese people are striving with full confidence to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule. All comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, like the people of the whole country, are celebrating the glorious victories of our great motherland in revolution and construction with infinite joy and excitement.

    Ten years ago, the great leader of the Chinese people, the creator and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrade Mao Zedong, clearly pointed out the new historical task of our army in his opening address to the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He said: "Our national defence will be consolidated, and no imperialists will be allowed to invade our territory again. On the basis of the heroic and tested People's Liberation Army, our people's armed forces must be preserved and developed. We will not only have a powerful army, but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy." Ten years of historical development have proved that with the rapid advancement of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, the national defence construction and the construction of the People's Liberation Army of our motherland have also achieved brilliant achievements. Comrade Mao Zedong's great call ten years ago has become and is becoming a reality. Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has carried out victorious struggles against domestic and foreign reactionaries on the military front, shattered their conspiracies to invade and sabotage our great motherland, defended national sovereignty, territorial integrity and security, defended China's socialist construction cause, defended peace in the Far East and the world, and tempered and strengthened itself in these arduous and glorious struggles.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our army has rapidly completed the tasks of wiping out the remnants of the enemy, unifying the mainland, and liberating Hainan, Zhoushan and other islands; at the same time, it launched a large-scale anti-banditry operation, pacifying banditry that had never been pacified in China's history. For ten years, our army has vigilantly guarded the motherland's long border, guarding the motherland's vast airspace and territorial waters, and severely打击ed enemies invading from the air, the sea, and the land. Our army has worked closely with the broad masses of fraternal nationalities, quelled the rebellions of reactionary upper-class elements, and powerfully assisted the social reform work in the fraternal nationalities areas. Our army has carried out long-term and complex struggles for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and has made a lot of preparations. In August 1958, the artillery of our army's Fujian front troops bombarded the Jinmen Chiang troops, not only punishing their crimes of harming the country and the people, but also severely打击ed the US imperialist conspiracy to create tension in the Far East.

    In June 1950, US imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea. At the same time, the US imperialists brutally occupied China's territory, Taiwan. The aggressive purpose of US imperialism was to attack the Chinese mainland after occupying the entire Korea, attempting to destroy the newly born People's Republic of China. Therefore, US imperialism brazenly disregarded the warnings of the Chinese people and government, and burned the flames of war to China's gate, bombing China's territory. In order to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, the Chinese people formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and entered Korea, and together with the Korean people and the People's Army, they fought heroically and stubbornly against the invading army led by the United States. After three years, they finally defeated the enemy with highly modernized equipment with inferior equipment, and won the great victory of the Korean armistice. This victory defended the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and our motherland, and further exposed the true face of the American paper tiger in front of the people of the world, greatly encouraging the struggle will of the people of the world against war and for peace, and had a huge and far-reaching significance for defending peace in the Far East and the world.

    While performing the above tasks, our army also victoriously realized the transition to a new stage of army building. Comrade Mao Zedong correctly stipulated the army building policy for our army in the new stage, which is: On the original basis, the Chinese People's Liberation Army should learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and build itself into an excellent modernized revolutionary army. Under the guidance of this policy, our army has gradually transitioned to the current new stage. This is a huge transformation in the history of army building. This transformation first started with improving the technical equipment of our army, which led to a series of changes in the army's command, organization, training, and system. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the strong support of the people of the whole country, the sincere help of the Soviet Union and various brotherly countries, and the hard work of all comrades in the army, this huge transformation of our army has been realized relatively smoothly. Now, our army has developed from a single service into a combined arms army. We not only have a powerful army including modern services, but also have established a powerful air force, and the strength of the navy has also developed accordingly. The technical equipment of the army has been greatly improved and enhanced. Through several years of combat training and technical training, the ability of army personnel to master modern combat tactics and technology has been significantly improved. After several years of exploration, various systems and regulations that are more in line with the actual situation of our army have been formulated, and a unified and regular order has been established. What is particularly important is that through several major ideological education and rectification movements, the socialist and communist consciousness of army members has been greatly improved, the Party's leadership over the army has been further consolidated, the internal unity of the army and the close unity between the army and the people has been consolidated, and the inherent fine traditions of our army have been inherited and carried forward. In short, under the leadership of the Party, our army has achieved significant achievements in the cause of army building, and we have laid a good foundation for building an excellent modernized revolutionary army.

    When reviewing the glorious road that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has traveled in the past ten years, it should be especially mentioned that since 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line, and encouraged and promoted by the nationwide great leap forward situation, the army's work, together with the nationwide great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, has set off a high tide of a great leap forward in the entire army. In this high tide, the appearance of all aspects of our army's work has been renewed, and the cause of army building has achieved unprecedented achievements.

    The great leap forward in army work, like the great leap forward on all fronts in the country, was launched on the basis of the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggles. The anti-rightist struggle in the army was also an extremely sharp and fierce class struggle. As a result of the struggle, the frenzied attacks of a small handful of rightists on socialism were completely smashed, bourgeois ideology was severely criticized, and socialist ideology achieved a decisive victory in the entire army. Some comrades with serious individualism have also received profound education in the struggle. This has greatly improved the level of communist consciousness of all army personnel. People increasingly regard building socialism and building a people's army to defend socialism as their own personal cause, and treat their work with the attitude of a master and with a high degree of communist responsibility. Revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary enterprising spirit are greatly enhanced. The victory of the army's rectification movement has also enabled everyone to carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and to carry forward a high degree of initiative and creativity. In terms of working methods, many mass line methods that have been effective in our army's history have been further developed. The army has also absorbed many new experiences in working methods from local work. It was on this basis that a broad mass-based, high-spirited, and energetic great leap forward movement in army work emerged.

    The army's great leap forward first started from the army's peacetime central work, namely training. In this great leap forward, the masses revised the unreasonable parts of certain rules and regulations, and organized the broad masses of officers and soldiers to participate in the work of compiling regulations and teaching materials. The masses actively proposed advanced training targets, formulated practical and feasible measures, and further carried forward the fine tradition of the mass line in training, carried forward the tenacious learning spirit of diligent study and hard practice, therefore, the training in 1958, both in terms of tactics and technology, increased many subjects compared with the previous year, and the time to complete the training was generally shortened by one or two months compared with the previous year. In terms of training methods and content, more attention was paid to the connection between theory and practice, and it was increasingly in line with the specific characteristics of our country and our army. Various military regions and units generally adopted various forms such as field camping training, the air force conducted emergency transfer site training, and the navy conducted transfer sea area training. This has better combined learning and application, improved training quality and army combat effectiveness.

    The great leap forward in training has achieved more significant results in military technology. This is mainly manifested in the widespread development of a mass movement of "one specialty, many skills." This movement is the development of the movement to create excellent sharpshooters and technical experts launched in the entire army in 1956. It embodies the desire of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of our army to master modern military technology faster and in greater numbers, and therefore, it has been enthusiastically supported by the entire army and quickly set off a mass movement to learn technology, greatly accelerating the progress of technical training and improving the quality. Judging from shooting, the main technical training subject, the results in 1958 were outstanding. The proportion of divisions, regiments, battalions, and companies with excellent shooting results has increased significantly. Many officers and soldiers have initially reached the standards of multi-skilled gunners, multi-skilled artillerymen, and multi-skilled tank crewmen. In this movement, many officers and soldiers not only skillfully mastered their professional and technical skills, but also initially learned various other skills related to their work. There are many benefits to the one specialty, many skills movement. Because everyone has learned multiple skills, it is possible to realize "one soldier, multiple uses" and ensure close coordination in combat and work. It can provide a large number of military technical instructors for the militia and prepare a large number of military technical backbones for the army. It can also provide technical personnel for national industrial and agricultural construction. This movement has already shown outstanding results in the battle in the coastal area of Fujian last year.

    In the entire army, especially in the technical services, another broad mass movement that manifests the great leap forward is the technical innovation movement. The results of this movement are also very significant, which has powerfully promoted the training work and combat readiness work of our army. Thanks to the hard work and ingenuity of the broad masses of officers and soldiers, many inventions and creations with practical value have emerged in the troops in a very short period of time. Many of these projects have caught up with the current most advanced levels. These inventions and creations have effectively enhanced the combat performance of certain technical equipment, enhanced the mobility and speed of the troops, improved the effectiveness of troop training, and saved a large amount of materials. In this movement, many technical services and troops set off a wave of self-repairing ships, airplanes, tanks, artillery, vehicles, tools and other technical equipment. This can increase the effectiveness of the use of weapons and equipment, save maintenance and repair costs in peacetime; and in wartime, it can be repaired as it is damaged, reducing the adverse effects on combat caused by damage to weapons and equipment, thereby relatively improving the combat effectiveness of various technical equipment. What is particularly worthy of emphasis is the significant role played by the technical innovation movement in the construction of national defense projects. Due to the deep and widespread development of the technical innovation movement, the construction efficiency has been greatly advanced and the labor intensity has been reduced in the construction of national defense projects, thereby guaranteeing the improvement and overfulfillment of the construction tasks. This is of great significance for the consolidation of our great motherland's national defense. The situation of no defense equipment in China's history has now undergone fundamental changes. It can be predicted that the "Great Wall" built by the Chinese People's Liberation Army with the support of the people of the whole country will become an impregnable wall standing on the sacred boundary of the motherland. Any enemy who dares to risk invading us will be battered and bloodied in front of them.

    Over the past ten years, in army building, we have adhered to the absolute leadership of the Party over the army, the leading position of political and ideological work in various tasks, the fundamental principles of army building such as unity between the army and the people, unity between officers and soldiers, and unity between superiors and subordinates. We have taken a series of measures to conduct serious struggles against all erroneous tendencies that deviate from these principles, thereby ensuring that our army becomes a docile tool in the hands of the Party and the people, and constantly enhancing the close unity within the army and the close connection between the army and the masses. In recent years, with the victorious development of the socialist revolution and the gradual improvement of the socialist ideological level of army members, the democratic life in our army under centralized leadership has also undergone new developments. Like the people of the whole country, the methods of great airing, great blooming, great debate, great character posters were also adopted in the army's rectification movement. In accordance with the principle of starting from the desire for unity, reaching new unity on a new basis through criticism or struggle, a widespread and in-depth democratic movement was launched within the army. This movement mainly focused on criticism and self-criticism conducted by the broad masses of officers and soldiers on a conscious basis. As a result of the movement, shortcomings and errors were discovered and corrected, work was improved, and everyone's political and ideological level was improved, the unity of officers and soldiers was enhanced, and the great leap forward in various tasks of the troops was promoted. The system of officers serving as soldiers, which was universally implemented in the entire army last year, is a pioneering work in our army's great leap forward to closely connect internal relations of the army. It has far-reaching significance. Because all officers spend one month each year eating, living, operating, working, and entertaining with the soldiers, it is a vivid Marxist lesson for both officers and soldiers. Through this lesson, the broad masses of officers and soldiers can deeply appreciate the spirit of equality between officers and soldiers in our army, which is more conducive to enhancing the close unity between officers and soldiers. For leading cadres, they can truly understand the situation of grassroots units through this lesson, which is conducive to preventing and overcoming the subjective and bureaucratic style of leadership work. The actual results of the implementation of this system in the entire army show that it has significant superiority. Combining this system with the democratic system and mass line that our army has long adhered to will make the internal relations of our army always maintain harmony. Creating a political situation in the army that has both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will, and both individual ease of mind and lively activity. This is a basic guarantee that our army will never be overwhelmed by the enemy.

    In the great leap forward, our army has also made outstanding achievements in supporting and participating in national construction. Our army has always shouldered the dual tasks of a fighting force and a working force. Over the past ten years since the founding of the country, all personnel of our army have enthusiastically participated in various social reforms and mass work. In the early days of the founding of the country, the army sent a large number of work teams to directly participate in the land reform movement. Later, when the high tide of agricultural cooperation came, a high tide of supporting agricultural cooperation quickly emerged in the army. In the summer and autumn of 1958, when the people's commune movement emerged in response to the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the broad masses of officers and soldiers, unlike those right-leaning opportunists, expressed their enthusiastic support and welcome to the people's communes. Last winter and this spring, most officers and soldiers of our army have visited, studied, and participated in labor in the people's communes, thereby more deeply recognizing the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes and its infinitely beautiful development prospects. In the nationwide campaign to run iron and steel in a big way, the army sent a large number of vehicles to support transportation, and the army itself also launched a campaign to smelt iron and steel, and also collected more than 100,000 tons of scrap iron and steel to contribute to the country. In order to reduce the burden on the country and the people and improve the army's food, our army also launched a production movement mainly based on agricultural and sideline industries, and has already achieved preliminary results. In addition, since the founding of the country, a large number of troops have participated in the basic construction of the country's industry, agriculture, and transportation, becoming shock troops in many famous engineering constructions. The army's participation in national construction not only powerfully supported socialist construction and promoted the development of national industry and agriculture; it also enhanced the unity between the army and the government and between the army and the people. Through participating in national construction and helping the masses with production labor, the labor concept and mass concept of the officers and soldiers of the troops have been greatly strengthened. The officialdom, arrogance, and delicacy of some comrades have also been greatly changed. Life has become more frugal and the style has become more approachable. The demeanor of "an ordinary worker" is also clearer. In labor, personally seeing the booming and bright prospects of the motherland's construction cause, personally experiencing the great strength and simple and lovely character of the working people, this has further strengthened the noble belief of the army comrades in loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, and loving socialism, and further strengthened the determination and confidence in building and defending the motherland. This confidence inspires them to bravely shoulder the glorious task of defenders and builders of the socialist cause.

    In the autumn of 1958, on the basis of the victorious development of the people's commune movement, in order to prevent possible imperialist aggression against our country, a high tide of running militia divisions in a big way emerged throughout the country. In a very short period of time, thousands of militia divisions were established throughout the country, and hundreds of millions of people were organized in the militia ranks. This prepared for the future implementation of "all people are soldiers" in our country in case of imperialist aggression. This is a major event with far-reaching strategic significance. In the long Chinese revolutionary war, the militia had played a significant role. Over the past ten years since the founding of the country, the militia has also played a significant role in cooperating with the troops to剿 exterminate bandits, quell rebellions, defend the border, maintain public order, and fight against infiltrating special agents, fully demonstrating that it is an indispensable national defense force. After combining the reserve service system with the militia system, the militia has become a good organizational form for accumulating and training reserve soldiers. Running militia divisions in a big way is one of the important products of the nationwide great leap forward in 1958, and together with the great leap forward in our army's construction cause, it has greatly advanced China's national defense construction cause. We fully believe that the militia force, which has unparalleled strength in the world, plus a powerful, excellent, modernized, and revolutionary army, is the reliable force to defend our country's security. If the enemy dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, they will surely find their graves in the vast ocean of "all people are soldiers" in our country.

    The great leap forward in army work in 1958 was a comprehensive great leap forward in the entire army, including all departments and corners of army work. The desire of the broad masses of officers and soldiers to rapidly strengthen army construction, the high sense of responsibility of the broad masses of officers and soldiers to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, and the Party's high prestige in the army made it possible for the Party's general line of building socialism to be resolutely implemented in all aspects of army work. The facts show that the brilliance of the Party's general line of building socialism not only illuminated the road of the great leap forward in industry, agriculture, and scientific and cultural undertakings, but also illuminated the road of the great leap forward in military work. The facts of the great leap forward in army work in 1958 and the continued leap forward in army work in 1959 completely refuted the slanderous remarks of right-leaning opportunists who believed that "the general line is not suitable for army work."

    Over the past ten years, especially since the great leap forward in 1958, army work has achieved great achievements under the leadership of the Party. However, we should not be complacent at all, and we still have arduous tasks to complete in front of us. We must be soberly aware that US imperialism and its servants are still deliberately engaging in criminal activities that hate our people. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, Mazu and other territories of the motherland remain to be liberated. We never invade others, nor will we ever invade others. However, we must always be vigilant and resolutely repel any foreign aggression. We must also prepare for the liberation of the sacred territory of the motherland and carry out unremitting struggles. Our struggle will not stop until Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu are liberated, this is our sacred duty. To this end, all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army must continue to go all out, aim high, and complete the glorious task of building a modernized revolutionary army with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    The experience of army building over the past ten years, especially since 1958, shows that the Party's general line of socialist revolution and socialist construction not only pointed out a clear political direction for us, but also brought us huge driving force. The reason why a vigorous great leap forward situation could emerge in our army's various tasks is first and foremost due to the result of implementing the Party's general line. Experience has also proved that the process of implementing the Party's general line is also a process of constantly and resolutely fighting against various right-leaning conservative ideas. At present, right-leaning opportunist ideology is the main danger that hinders the continued leap forward. Right-leaning opportunists doubt the correctness of the Party's general line, doubt the superiority of the people's communes, and doubt the achievements of the great leap forward. They completely close their eyes to reality and openly slander the great leap forward and the people's commune movement as "petty bourgeois fanatical movements." This is obviously completely wrong. Their fallacies have been severely criticized by the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country. Resolutely defending and implementing the Party's general line is the glorious duty of our army. All comrades in the army must earnestly study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, resolutely overcome right-leaning opportunist ideology, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of right-leaning opportunist ideology. This is the premise for ensuring the continued leap forward in army work.

    The army building experience of our army over the past ten years and the historical experience of our army over the past thirty years both show that striving to study Comrade Mao Zedong's military thinking and using Comrade Mao Zedong's military thinking as the guiding principle for military work is the decisive factor for our army to achieve all victories. Comrade Mao Zedong's military thinking is the military thinking of Marxism-Leninism, a brilliant example of the close integration of Marxist theory and the practice of the Chinese revolutionary war. It is not only the crystallization of our army's thirty years of army building and combat experience, but also an important component of Marxist military theory. The Party Central Committee instructed us when commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of our army: "The operational principles of people's war and the principles of army building of the people's army formulated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong not only guided the Chinese revolutionary war from victory to victory in the past under extremely difficult conditions, but also in the future struggle to build a modernized revolutionary army and smash imperialist aggression, it is still the guiding ideology that our army must resolutely follow in the future." The development process of our army building over the past ten years fully proves that this conclusion of the Party Central Committee is completely correct. At present, the broad masses of cadres in our army are enthusiastically studying Comrade Mao Zedong's military works. We firmly believe that through this study, Comrade Mao Zedong's military thinking will be mastered by the broad masses of cadres in our army, and will play its huge guiding role in the cause of army building and defending the motherland.

    Celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, all comrades in the army are firmly united around the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the glorious illumination of the general line, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's military thinking, strive for the continued leap forward in military work, and bravely advance to the victorious completion of the great task of army building and defending the motherland!

    在总路线的光辉照耀下为军事工作的继续跃进而奋斗
    国防委员会副主席　贺龙
    1949年10月1日，毛泽东同志庄严地向全世界宣告了中华人民共和国的诞生。从那时到现在，已经整整十年了。这是光荣的十年，伟大的十年。在这个短短的历史时期内，全国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，迅速地医治了长期战争的创伤，胜利地进行了社会主义革命和社会主义建设。我们国家对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业进行了全面的社会主义改造，基本上完成了在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命的任务。我国人民又进行了全民整风运动和反对右派斗争，在思想战线和政治战线方面取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利。这样，社会主义就在各个方面基本上战胜了资本主义。同时，我国的社会主义建设也取得了巨大的进展，由于第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成，使我国建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。1958年以来，全国人民又在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的全面大跃进的热潮，工业、农业和科学文化事业，都获得了历史上空前未有的大发展。目前，我国人民正在信心百倍地为在两年内提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗。中国人民解放军的全体同志，同全国人民一样，以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情，庆祝我们伟大祖国在革命和建设中的辉煌胜利。
    十年前，中国人民的伟大领袖，中国人民解放军的创造者和领导者毛泽东同志，在中国人民政治协商会议第一届会议的开幕词中，明确地指出了我军新的历史任务。他说：“我们的国防将获得巩固，不允许任何帝国主义者再来侵略我们的国土。在英勇的经过了考验的人民解放军的基础上，我们的人民武装力量必须保存和发展起来。我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军”。十年的历史发展过程已经证明，随着我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的突飞猛进，我们祖国的国防建设和人民解放军的建设，同样取得了光辉的成就。毛泽东同志十年前的伟大号召，已经和正在变为现实。十年来，中国人民解放军在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，同国内外反动派在军事战线上进行了胜利的斗争，粉碎了他们侵犯和破坏我们伟大祖国的阴谋，保卫了国家主权、领土的完整和安全，保卫了我国的社会主义建设事业，保卫了远东和世界和平，并且在这些艰苦而光荣的斗争中，锻炼和壮大了自己。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，我军迅速地完成了肃清残敌、统一大陆、解放海南、舟山等岛的任务；同时展开了大规模的剿匪作战，平息了我国有史以来从未平息过的匪患。我军十年如一日警惕地守卫着祖国漫长的边防，守卫着祖国辽阔的领空和领海，严重地打击了从空中、从海洋、从陆地侵入的敌人。我军和兄弟民族的广大群众亲密合作，平息了反动上层分子的叛乱，有力地协助了兄弟民族地区的社会改革工作。我军为解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖，进行了长期的复杂的斗争，作了大量的准备工作。1958年8月，我军福建前线部队炮击金门蒋军，不仅惩罚了他们祸国残民的罪行，而且严重地打击了美帝国主义制造远东紧张局势的阴谋。
    1950年6月，美帝国主义发动了对朝鲜的侵略战争，同时，美帝国主义者横蛮地霸占了我国的领土台湾。美帝国主义的侵略目的，是想在占领全部朝鲜以后，进而进攻中国大陆，妄图摧毁诞生不久的中华人民共和国。因此，美帝国主义悍然不顾中国人民和政府的警告，把战火烧向我国大门，轰炸我国领土。为着抗美援朝、保家卫国，中国人民组成了中国人民志愿军进入朝鲜，同朝鲜人民和人民军一起，向以美国为首组成的侵略军，进行了英勇顽强的战斗。经过三年时间，终于以劣势装备打败了具有高度现代化装备的敌人，赢得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利。这个胜利，保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和我们祖国的安全，并且在全世界人民面前，进一步戳穿了美国纸老虎的真象，极大地鼓舞了全世界人民反对战争，争取和平的斗争意志，对于保卫远东与世界和平，具有巨大而深远的意义。
    我军在执行上述任务的同时，还胜利地实现了向建军新阶段的过渡。毛泽东同志正确地规定了我军在新阶段的建军方针，这就是：中国人民解放军要在原有的基础上，学习苏联的先进经验，建设成为一支优良的现代化的革命军队。我军在这个方针的指导下，已经逐步地过渡到现在的新阶段。这是我军建军史上一次巨大的转变。这个转变，首先是从改善我军的技术装备开始的，由此引起了军队的指挥、编制、训练、制度等一系列的变革。由于党的正确领导，全国人民的大力支援，苏联和各个兄弟国家的真诚帮助，加上全军同志的努力工作，我军这次规模巨大的变革，已经比较顺利地实现了。现在，我们的军队已经从单一的兵种发展成为诸兵种合成军队。我们不但有着一支包括现代各兵种的强大的陆军，也建立起了一支强大的空军，海军的力量也有了相应的发展。军队的技术装备大为改善和提高。通过几年来的战斗训练和技术训练，军队人员掌握现代作战的战术和技术的能力，有了显著的进步。经过几年的摸索过程，制定了较为符合我军实际情况的各种制度和条令，建立了统一的正规的秩序。特别重要的是，通过几次大的思想教育和整风运动，大大提高了军队成员的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，进一步巩固了党对军队的领导，巩固了军队内部和军队与人民的亲密团结，继承和发扬了我军固有的优良传统。总之，我军在党的领导下，在军队建设事业上，取得了重大的成就，我们已经为建设一支优良的现代化的革命军队，打下了良好的基础。
    回顾中国人民解放军十年来走过的光荣道路的时候，应当特别提到的，就是在1958年以来，军队工作在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞和推动下，同全国工农业生产大跃进一道，掀起了一个全军大跃进的高潮。在这个高潮中，我军各方面工作的面貌焕然一新，军队建设事业取得了空前未有的成就。
    军队工作的大跃进，同全国各个战线上的大跃进一样，是在整风和反右派斗争取得胜利的基础上展开的。军队中的反右派斗争，同样是一场极其尖锐激烈的阶级斗争。斗争的结果，一小撮右派分子对社会主义的猖狂进攻被彻底粉碎，资产阶级思想受到了严厉的批判，社会主义思想在全军取得了决定性的胜利。某些有严重个人主义思想的同志，也在斗争中得到了深刻的教育。这就使全军人员的共产主义觉悟水平大为提高。人们愈益把建设社会主义和建设一支保卫社会主义的人民军队，当作自己的切身事业，以主人公的态度，以高度的共产主义责任心，对待自己的工作。革命的干劲和革命的进取心大为昂扬。军队整风运动的胜利，又使大家发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，发扬了高度的积极性和创造精神。在工作方法上，许多在我军历史上行之有效的群众路线的方法，得到了进一步的发展。军队也从地方工作中吸取了许多工作方法上的新经验。就是在这样的基础上，出现了一个广大群众性的、意气风发、干劲冲天的军队工作大跃进运动。
    军队的大跃进，首先是从军队平时的中心工作即训练工作中展开的。在这个大跃进的浪潮中，群众修改了某些规章制度中的不合理部分，组织了广大官兵群众参加编写条令、教材的工作。群众主动地提出了先进的训练指标，订出了切实可行的措施，加上在训练中进一步发挥了群众路线的优良传统，发扬了勤学苦练的顽强学习精神，因此，1958年的训练，不论在战术和技术方面，都比上一年增加了许多课目，而完成训练的时间，一般比上一年缩短了一两个月。在训练方法和内容上，更加注意理论与实际的联系，愈益切合我国我军的具体特点。各军区、各部队普遍采用了野营训练等多种形式，空军进行了紧急转移场地的训练，海军进行了转移海域的训练。这样就使学与用更好地结合起来，提高了训练质量和军队的战斗力。
    训练大跃进在军事技术方面，获得了更为显著的成效。这主要表现在广泛地开展了“一专多能”的群众性运动。这个运动，是1956年在全军开展的创造优等射手和技术能手运动的发展。它体现了我军广大官兵要求更快、更多地掌握现代军事技术的愿望，因而，得到了全军的热烈拥护，很快地就掀起了一个学习技术的群众运动热潮，大大加快了技术训练的进度，提高了质量。从射击这一主要的技术训练课目来看，1958年的成绩是突出的。射击成绩总评优秀的师、团、营、连的比例，都有很大增长。许多官兵已经初步达到多能枪手，多能炮手，多能坦克手的标准。许多官兵在这个运动中，不仅熟炼地掌握了本职业务技术，而且初步学会了与本职工作有关的其他多种技能。一专多能运动有很多好处。由于每人学会了多种技术，因此就可以实现“一兵多用”，保证在战斗中和工作中密切协同动作。它可以为民兵提供大量的军事技术教员，为军队准备大批军事技术骨干。它还可以为国家工、农业建设提供技术人员。这个运动，在去年福建沿海的战斗中，已经显示了卓越的成效。
    在全军，特别是在技术兵种中，表现大跃进的另一个广大的群众性运动，就是技术革新运动。这个运动的成果，同样是非常显著的，它有力地推进了我军的训练工作和作战准备工作。由于广大官兵发挥了苦干、巧干的精神，在很短的时间内，部队中就涌现了许多有实际价值的发明创造。其中不少项目，已经赶上了当前最先进的水平。这些发明创造，有效地增强了某些技术装备的战斗性能，增强了部队的机动性和快速性，提高了部队训练的效果，并且节约了大批资材。在这个运动中，许多技术兵种和部队，掀起了自修舰艇、飞机、坦克、火炮、车辆、工具等技术装备的热潮。这在平时，可以增加武器装备使用的时效，节约维护修理费用；而在战时，可以随破随修，减少因武器装备遭受损伤而对战斗造成的不利影响，从而相对地提高了各种技术装备的战斗效能。尤其值得着重指出的，是技术革新运动在国防工程施工中所起的重大作用。由于深入地普遍地开展了技术革新运动，在国防工程施工中，大大提前了施工效率，减轻了劳动强度，从而保证了提高和超额完成施工任务。这对于我们伟大祖国国防的巩固，有着重大的意义。我国历史上毫无防御设备的情况，现在已经起了根本的变化。可以预断：在全国人民支援下，由中国人民解放军亲手建筑起来的“万里长城”，将成为屹立在祖国神圣疆界上的铜墙铁壁。任何敢于冒险侵犯我们的敌人，都将在它们面前碰得头破血流。
    十年来，我们在建军中，坚持了党对军队的绝对领导，政治思想工作在各项工作中的领先地位，军民一致、官兵一致、上下一致等建军的根本原则。我们曾经采取了一系列的措施，同一切离开这些原则的错误倾向，进行了严肃的斗争，从而保证我军成为党和人民手中的驯服工具，并不断地增强了军队内部的亲密团结，增强了军队和人民群众的紧密联系。最近几年来，随着社会主义革命的胜利发展，和军队成员的社会主义思想水平的逐步提高，我军在集中领导下的民主生活，也有了新的发展。和全国人民一样，在军队的整风运动中，也采用了大鸣、大放、大争、大辩和大字报的方法。按照从团结的愿望出发，通过批评或者斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结的原则，在军队内部展开了广泛深入的民主运动。这个运动，是以广大官兵在自觉的基础上，进行批评和自我批评为主要内容的。运动的结果，是既发现和纠正了缺点和错误，改进了工作，又提高了大家的政治思想水平，增强了官兵团结，推进了部队各项工作的大跃进。去年在全军普遍实行的军官当兵的制度，是我军在大跃进中密切军队内部关系的一个创举。它具有深远的意义。由于全体军官每年都有一个月时间和士兵同吃、同住、同操作、同劳动、同娱乐，无论对军官和士兵来说，都是一堂生动的马克思主义课程。通过这一堂课，广大官兵可以深刻体会到我军官兵平等的精神，这就更加有利于增强官兵之间的亲密团结。对于领导干部来说，可以通过这一堂课，切实了解基层单位的情况，有利于防止和克服领导工作上的主观主义和官僚主义作风。这个制度在全军实行的实际结果表明，它具有显著的优越性。把这个制度，和我军长期以来坚持实行的民主制度和群众路线结合起来，将使我军内部关系永远保持融洽和谐。在军队中造成一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼那样一种政治局面。这是我军永远不会被敌人压倒的一个基本保证。
    大跃进中，我军在支援和参加国家建设方面，也作出了突出的成绩。我军从来就担负着战斗队和工作队的双重任务。建国十年来，我军全体人员，满怀热情地参加了各种社会改革和群众工作。建国初期，军队派出了大批工作队，直接参加了土地改革运动。后来，当农业合作化高潮到来时，军队中也迅速地掀起了一个支援农业合作化的高潮。1958年夏秋，当适应工农业大跃进而出现了人民公社化运动时，广大官兵和那些右倾机会主义分子截然不同，对人民公社表示了热诚拥护和欢迎。去冬今春，我军大多数官兵，都曾经到人民公社中去参观学习和参加劳动，从而更深刻地认识到人民公社的无比优越性和它的无限美好的发展远景。在全民大办钢铁的运动中，军队派出了大量车辆支援运输，军队本身也开展了炼钢铁的运动，此外还搜集了十余万吨废钢铁献给国家。为着减轻国家和人民的负担，改善军队伙食，我军还开展了以农副业为主的生产运动，并且已经取得了初步成绩。此外，建国以来在国家的工业、农业、交通运输业的基本建设中，也都有大量部队参加，成为不少著名工程建筑中的突击队。军队参加国家建设，不仅有力地支援了社会主义建设，促进了国家工农业的发展；同时也增进了军队和政府之间，军队和人民之间的团结。通过参加国家建设和帮助群众生产劳动，部队官兵的劳动观点和群众观点，都大大加强了。某些同志的官气、骄气和娇气也大大改变了。生活更加俭朴，作风更加平易近人。“一个普通劳动者”的风貌也更加清晰了。在劳动中，亲自看到祖国建设事业的蒸蒸日上和光明的远景，亲身体会到劳动人民的伟大力量和淳朴可爱的性格，这就进一步加强了军队同志热爱祖国、热爱人民、热爱劳动、热爱社会主义的崇高信念，进一步加强建设祖国和保卫祖国的决心与信心。这种信心鼓舞他们勇敢地担当起社会主义事业的保卫者和建设者的光荣任务。
    1958年秋季在人民公社化运动胜利发展的基础上，我国人民为了防止帝国主义对我国的可能的侵略，全国各地出现了一个大办民兵师的高潮。很短的时间内，全国就建立了数以千计的民兵师，亿万人民被组织在民兵队伍中。这就为将来一旦遭受帝国主义侵略，在我国实行“全民皆兵”做了准备。这是一件有深远战略意义的大事。在长期的中国革命战争中，民兵曾经发挥过重大的作用。建国十年来，民兵在配合部队剿灭土匪，平定叛乱，保卫边防，维持治安和反对潜入特务等斗争中，同样发挥了重大的作用，充分显示了它是一支不可缺少的国防力量。在把后备兵役制度同民兵制度合而为一以后，民兵又成为积蓄和训练后备兵员的良好组织形式。大办民兵师，这是1958年全国大跃进的重要产物之一，它和我军建设事业的大跃进一起，把我国的国防建设事业，大大地向前推进了一步。我们完全相信：有着举世无双的雄厚力量的民兵队伍，再加上一支强大的优良的现代化的革命军队，这就是保卫我国安全的可靠力量。如果敌人敢于发动侵略我国的战争，他们就一定会在我国“全民皆兵”的汪洋大海里，找到自己的坟墓。
    1958年的军队工作大跃进，是一个全军范围的全面大跃进，包括了军队工作的各部门，各角落。广大官兵要求迅速加强军队建设的愿望，广大官兵保卫祖国社会主义建设的高度责任感，以及党在军队中的崇高威信，就使得党的建设社会主义的总路线在军队工作的各个方面得到了坚决的贯彻和执行。事实表明，党的建设社会主义的总路线的光辉，不但照亮了工业、农业和科学文化事业大跃进的道路，也照亮了军事工作大跃进的道路。1958年军队工作大跃进，和1959年军队工作继续跃进的事实，完全驳倒了那种认为“总路线不适合军队工作”的右倾机会主义的谰言。
    十年来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，军队工作在党的领导下，取得了巨大的成就。但是，我们一点也不应该骄傲自满，在我们面前还有艰巨的任务要去完成。必须清醒地看到，美帝国主义和他的仆从们，仍然在处心积虑地进行仇视我国人民的罪恶活动。台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖等祖国领土，尚待解放。我们从来不侵略别人，也永远不会侵略别人。但是，我们必须时刻保持警惕，坚决打退任何外来的侵略。我们还必须为解放祖国的神圣领土，作好准备，并进行坚持不懈的斗争。台、澎、金、马一日不解放，我们的斗争也一日不停止，这是我们的神圣职责。为此，中国人民解放军全体同志，必须继续鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地完成建设现代化革命军队的光荣任务。
    十年来，特别是1958年以来的建军经验表明，党的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的总路线，不仅给我们指出了明确的政治方向，而且给我们带来了巨大的推动力量。我军各项工作，所以能够出现轰轰烈烈的大跃进局面，首先就是由于贯彻执行党的总路线的结果。经验还证明，贯彻执行党的总路线的过程，也就是不断地和各种右倾保守思想坚决斗争的过程。目前，右倾机会主义思想，是阻碍继续跃进的主要危险。右倾机会主义分子怀疑党的总路线的正确性，怀疑人民公社的优越性，怀疑大跃进的成就，他们完全闭眼不看现实，公然污蔑大跃进和人民公社运动是“小资产阶级狂热性的运动”。这显然是完全错误的。他们的谬论，已经遭到了全党、全军和全国人民的严肃批判。坚决保卫和贯彻执行党的总路线，是我军的光荣职责。全军同志必须认真学习党的八届八中全会文件，坚决克服右倾机会主义思想，彻底肃清右倾机会主义思想的影响。这是保证军队工作继续跃进的前提。
    十年来我军的建军经验和三十年来我军的历史经验都表明，努力学习毛泽东同志的军事思想，用毛泽东同志的军事思想作为军事工作的指导方针，是我军取得一切胜利的决定因素。毛泽东同志的军事思想，就是马克思列宁主义的军事思想，是马克思主义理论和中国革命战争实践紧密结合的光辉范例。它不仅是我军三十年建军和作战经验的结晶，而且是马克思主义军事学说的一个重要组成部分，党中央在纪念我军三十周年的时候指示我们：“党和毛泽东同志所制定的人民战争的作战原则和人民军队的建军原则，不仅在过去极端困难的条件下，引导中国革命战争从胜利走向胜利，而且在今后建设现代化革命军队和粉碎帝国主义侵略的斗争中，仍然是我军今后必须坚决遵循的指导思想”。十年来我军建设的发展过程，充分证明了党中央这个论断是完全正确的。目前，我军广大干部，正在热烈地学习毛泽东同志的军事著作。我们深信，经过这次学习，毛泽东同志的军事思想必将为我军广大干部所掌握，在军队建设和保卫祖国的事业中，发挥它巨大的指导作用。
    庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年，全军同志坚定地团结在党中央和毛泽东同志的周围，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在毛泽东同志的军事思想指导下，为军事工作的继续跃进，为胜利完成军队建设和保卫祖国的伟大任务，奋勇前进！
