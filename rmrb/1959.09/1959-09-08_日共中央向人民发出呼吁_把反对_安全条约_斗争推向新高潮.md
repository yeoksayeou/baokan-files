Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: The Cadre Council of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party today published an appeal in the "Akahata" newspaper, calling on the Japanese people to push the struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to a new high tide.

The appeal pointed out: The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, with the support of U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital, is stubbornly and willfully trying to revise the "Security Treaty."

In the appeal, the Japanese Communist Party pointed out: In order to effectively fight against the enemy's offensive, the united struggle of the broad masses of the people, with the working class as the core, should be pushed to a high tide. In order to effectively develop the unified action to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," the most important thing is to conduct propaganda among the working class, farmers, intellectuals, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, and other strata of the people, explaining that the revision of the "Security Treaty" is a matter related to Japan's peace, neutrality, and independence, and is closely related to democratic rights and the daily interests of the people of all strata. Therefore, various struggles must be combined.

The Japanese Communist Party then put forward slogans to strengthen the united struggle of the people. These slogans call on the people to prevent the revision and abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," advocate the prohibition of nuclear armament, smash the policy of acting as an accomplice of the United States and being hostile to China, strive for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, withdraw U.S. military bases, recover Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, support the verdict on the "Sunagawa Incident," and defend the lives and rights of workers and the people. These slogans point out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian people, and call for the overthrow of the traitorous and reactionary culprit - the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. These slogans finally call for the establishment of united struggle organizations of all patriotic and democratic forces, including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, in all workplaces, cities, towns, and villages; all people who hope for Japan's security and independence should participate in the unified action against the "Security Treaty"; and strive for the establishment of a national democratic united front with the goal of establishing a peaceful, independent, neutral, democratic, and prosperous Japan!

    日共中央向人民发出呼吁
    把反对“安全条约”斗争推向新高潮
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天在“赤旗报”上发表呼吁书，号召日本人民把反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争推向新高潮。
    呼吁书指出：岸信介内阁在美帝国主义和日本垄断资本的支持下，正在一意孤行，硬要修改“安全条约”。
    日本共产党在呼吁书中指出：为了有效地同敌人的进攻进行斗争，应该把以工人阶级为核心的广大人民的联合斗争推向高潮。为了使阻止修改“安全条约”的统一行动有效地发展，最重要的是：在工人阶级、农民、知识分子阶层、中小企业家以及其他各阶层人民中进行宣传，说明修改“安全条约”问题是关系到日本的和平、中立、独立的问题，并且同民主权利和各阶层人民的日常利益密切有关。因此，必须把各种斗争结合起来。
    日本共产党接着提出了加强人民联合斗争的口号。这些口号号召人民阻止修改并且废除日美“安全条约”，主张禁止核武装，粉碎充当美国帮凶并敌视中国的政策，争取恢复日中邦交，缔结日苏和约，撤销美国的军事基地，收回冲绳岛和小笠原群岛，支持关于“砂川事件”的判决，保卫工人和人民的生活和权利。这些口号指出，美国帝国主义者是亚洲人民的共同敌人，并且号召打倒卖国、反动的罪魁——岸信介内阁。这些口号最后号召在所有的工作场所、市、镇、村建立包括共产党和社会党在内的全体爱国民主力量的联合斗争组织；所有希望日本安全、独立的人们，都来参加反对“安全条约”的统一行动；以建立和平、独立、中立、民主、繁荣的日本为目标，为建立民族民主统一战线而奋斗！
