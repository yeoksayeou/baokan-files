　　Report from this newspaper: Although, starting from the beginning of this year, a buying spree was set off in the American steel market in preparation for the American steelworkers' strike, which strongly stimulated steel exports from various Western European countries, according to statistics published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the steel output of some major Western European countries in the first six months of this year was still lower than the level of the same period in 1958.

　　The British steel industry, which has consistently operated at only 75% capacity, saw an increase in steel exports to the United States in the first half of this year, but its actual output decreased by 969,000 American tons (note: one American ton equals 0.907 metric tons) compared to the same period last year, reaching only 10,820,000 American tons. The 1958 level of British steel output was already 10% lower than in 1957.

　　France, which devalued the franc and made its domestic steel prices the lowest in Western Europe, strengthened its export competitiveness as a result. In April of this year, steel exports reached 280,000 tons (the average monthly export volume in the fourth quarter of last year was only 150,000 tons). In the first four months of this year, France's steel sales in the United States exceeded half of its total sales in the United States last year. However, due to the shrinking domestic market, France's steel output in the first half of this year decreased by 62,000 American tons compared to the same period last year.

　　In 1958, Italy's steel output had already declined from 6,787,400 American tons in the previous year to 6,268,900 American tons. However, in the first half of this year, compared to the same period last year, it remained sluggish, with another reduction of 80,000 American tons.

　　Even in West Germany, which has been touting rapid industrial growth this year, its steel output in the first half of the year was 0.7% lower than in the same period last year. In 1958, the operating rate of the West German steel industry was only 70% to 75%.

    西欧主要国家钢铁工业不振
    今年上半年产量比去年同期普遍下降
    本报讯　尽管从今年年初起，为准备应付美国钢铁工人罢工，美国钢铁市场上掀起的抢购风潮，曾有力地刺激了西欧各国钢的出口，可是根据美国商务部公布的统计数字，一些西欧主要国家今年头六个月的钢产量仍低于1958年同期的水平。
    开工率一向只有75％的英国炼钢业在今年上半年对美钢材输出有所增加的情况下，实际产量却比去年同期减少了九十六万九千美吨（按：一美吨等于零点九零七公吨）。只达到一千零八十二万美吨。而1958年英国钢产量的水平已经比1957年低了10％。
    由于实行法郎贬值而使本国钢价成为西欧最低的国家的法国，由于出口竞争能力转强，今年4月份钢的出口达到二十八万吨（去年第四季每月平均仅出口十五万吨），今年头四个月法国在美国销售的钢，超过了去年全年它在美国销售的钢的一半，但是由于国内市场的萎缩法国今年上半年的钢产量却比去年同期减少了六万二千美吨。
    1958年意大利的钢产量曾从前一年的六百七十八万七千四百美吨下降到六百二十六万八千九百美吨。但是今年上半年和去年同期相比，仍然不振，又减产八万美吨。
    甚至在今年以来已吹嘘工业迅速上升的西德，它的上半年的钢产量也低于去年同期0.7％。而1958年西德钢铁工业的开工率只有70％到75％。
