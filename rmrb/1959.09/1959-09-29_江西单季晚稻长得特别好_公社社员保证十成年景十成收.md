    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 28th: Commune members in Jiangxi are carefully harvesting single-season late rice, determined to achieve a ten-tenths harvest in this ten-tenths year, and strive to reap several million more catties of grain to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

    This year, Jiangxi Province's seven million mu of single-season late rice is growing exceptionally well. Victory reports have been frequently coming in since the harvest began. In Gao'an County, where single-season late rice yields used to be low, this year's 210,000 mu of single-season late rice all have thick stalks and robust plants, standing three feet tall with long, full ears. The average yield per mu of the harvested rice has increased by more than double compared to last year. In Pingxiang County, the 15,000 mu already harvested has been threshed and inspected, and the average yield per mu has increased by 60% compared to last year. In Guangfeng County, the 6,200 mu already threshed and inspected has an average yield per mu that has increased by 50% compared to last year. As of the 22nd, the province had already harvested 460,000 mu of single-season late rice, and the yield per unit area has greatly increased compared to last year.

    This year, Jiangxi's single-season late rice encountered severe drought and pests shortly after planting, but the people's communes everywhere brought their great power into play, overcame various natural disasters, and won a bumper harvest.

    In order to combat the extreme drought, the counties of Jiujiang Prefecture organized an army of 500,000 drought fighters who struggled in the fields for a long time, opening mountains and splitting ridges, digging canals to divert water, and saving the drought-stricken rice seedlings. Wuning and Ruichang counties dug more than 6,500 small springs and mountain streams, allowing the rice paddies to be irrigated in time. In Ruichang County, the single-season late rice fields of the Dongshan Brigade and the Yuanyuan Brigade of the Fanzhen Commune suffered reduced production every year due to insufficient water sources. This year, with the help of the commune, the two brigades worked together to build two large embankments on a nearby small mountain stream, blocking the water flow and increasing the amount of water stored in the mountain stream, solving the problem of insufficient water sources, so that the late rice still grew well under the threat of extreme drought. It has now begun to be harvested, and the yield has increased by 50% to 70% compared to last year.

    江西单季晚稻长得特别好
    公社社员保证十成年景十成收
    据新华社南昌28日电　江西各地人民公社社员正在精心收割单季晚稻，决心做到十成年景十成收，争取多收几百万斤粮食，迎接建国十周年。
    今年，江西省七百万亩单季晚稻长得特别好，一开始收割就频传丰收捷报。过去单季晚稻产量不高的高安县，今年二十一万亩单季晚稻，都长得兜粗秆壮，株高三尺，穗长粒饱；已经收下来的稻谷，平均亩产量都比去年增长一倍以上。萍乡县已经收割的一万五千亩，经过脱粒验收，平均亩产比去年增长六成。广丰县已经脱粒验收的六千二百亩，平均亩产比去年增长五成。到22日止，全省已经收割了四十六万亩单季晚稻，单位面积产量都比去年大大增长。
    江西今年单季晚稻栽种不久就遇到了严重的干旱和虫害，但是各地人民公社发挥巨大威力，战胜各种自然灾害，夺得了丰收。
    九江地区各县为了战胜特大干旱，组织了五十万抗旱大军，长期奋战田间，开山劈岭，挖渠引水，挽救了受旱禾苗。武宁、瑞昌两县挖小泉、掘山溪六千五百多处，使稻田得到了及时灌溉。瑞昌县范镇公社东山大队和源源大队的单季晚稻田，年年都因为水源不足受旱减产。今年这两个大队在公社的帮助下，同心协力，在附近的一条小山溪上筑起两条大堰垱，堵住流水，增加山溪的蓄水量，解决了水源不足的困难，使晚稻在特大干旱的威胁下，仍然生长良好；目前已开始收割，产量比去年增长五成到七成。
