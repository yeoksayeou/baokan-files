    Where does the reason for rapid change lie?
    In Cangwu County, Guangxi, twenty-seven economically weak and production-lagging brigades caught up with the advanced teams in the short span of one year after the establishment of the commune. This has created a new situation of balanced development and common leap forward among the various communes and brigades, taking the advanced as their benchmark.
    Why were these teams able to change their poor and backward conditions so quickly? There are three reasons: First, the commune strengthened its leadership over the backward teams and used the public economy belonging to the entire commune to provide economic assistance to the backward teams. Second, the brotherly brigades demonstrated a communist spirit and actively supported the backward teams in all aspects. Third, the commune strengthened political and ideological education for the backward teams, continuously improving the awareness of the commune members, enabling the members of these teams to establish the determination and confidence to work hard, become self-reliant, and regenerate.
    Although there may be three or more reasons, "all streams flow into the sea," and ultimately, it is inseparable from the commune. Without the large collective of the commune, which has a large organizational scale and a wide range of activities, no production team (the original agricultural cooperative) could have such a strong public economic strength. Without the commune, the economic foundation of the small collective would not have changed, and people's collectivist thinking and communist style would not be as strong and high as they are now. In the past, during the cooperative period, there was also mutual support and cooperation, but both in terms of the scope and extent of support and cooperation, it was far behind the situation after the establishment of the commune.
    Working hard and self-reliance, of course, play an extremely important role in changing the poor and backward appearance of backward teams. As the saying goes, people are not afraid of poverty, but of losing heart. Losing heart will lead to being content with poverty, shrinking back, and losing the determination and courage to change the poor situation. On the contrary, if people are poor but have high aspirations, they can prevent themselves from being intimidated by the current poverty, and they can encourage themselves to work hard, become self-reliant, and use their greatest efforts and muster the greatest courage to fight to change their poor situation. However, "self-reliance" is ultimately limited. With the help of "collective strength," "self-reliance" can be brought into play more and better. Larger things cannot be done by the strength of one team alone, and this strength can only be left idle. With the strong support of the commune, the strength of this team can be fully utilized. Some things can also be done by relying on the "self-reliance" of one team alone, but it will take much longer to do them. With the strong support of the commune, they can be done faster. Of course, it is not possible to rely solely on the help of others without striving to move forward. Only by working hard and relying on one's own efforts on the one hand, and adding the assistance of the commune and brotherly teams on the other hand, can backward teams change from poor to rich and catch up with the advanced in a short period of time.
    It is hoped that all backward teams can work hard and become self-reliant like the twenty-seven brigades in Cangwu. It is also hoped that all communes can give full play to the advantages of the commune, strengthen the backward teams in all aspects, and help the backward teams, so that the backward teams can catch up with the advanced in a relatively short period of time, just like the various communes in Cangwu County.

### 变得快的原因在哪里？

    变得快的原因在哪里？
    广西苍梧县有二十七个经济基础比较薄弱、生产落后的大队，在公社成立后的短短一年间，就赶上了先进队，使各公社各个大队之间出现了以先进为标兵的平衡发展、共同跃进的新局面。
    为什么这些队能够这样快地改变贫困落后的面貌呢？原因有三个：一是公社加强了对落后队的领导，用属于全公社所有的公共经济对落后队进行了经济上的援助；二是各个兄弟大队发扬了共产主义风格，积极从各方面支援了落后队；三是公社对落后队加强了政治思想教育，不断提高了社员觉悟，使这些队的社员树立了发奋图强、自力更生的决心和信心。
    原因虽然有三个或者更多，但是“千条细流归大海”，归根结底还是离不了公社。没有组织规模大、活动范围广的公社这个大集体，任何生产队（原来的农业社）都不可能有这样强大的公有经济力量。没有公社，小集体的经济基础没有改变，人们的集体主义思想和共产主义风格也不会像现在这样强这样高。过去，在合作社时期，虽然也有过互相间的支援和协作，但是，无论就支援协作的范围和程度说，都远赶不上公社成立以后的情况。
    发奋图强、自力更生，对于落后队贫困落后面貌的改变，当然起着极其重要的作用。俗话说，人不怕穷只怕气短。气短，就会安于穷困，就会畏畏缩缩，丧失改变穷困面貌的决心和勇气。相反，人穷志不穷，人穷志气高，就可以使人不致为眼前的穷困所吓倒，就可以激励自己发奋图强、自力更生，用自己最大的努力，鼓起最大的勇气，为改变自己的穷困面貌而斗争。但是，“自力”毕竟有限。有了“群力”的帮助，“自力”才能更多更好地发挥出来。比较大的事情，一个队的力量办不了，这力量就只好闲置着；有了公社的大力支援，这个队的力量就可以充分施展。有些事情，只靠一个队的“自力”也能办，可是办起来要慢得多；有了公社的大力支援，就可以办得更快。当然，光靠别人帮助，自己不力争上游，那也是不行的。只有一方面自己发奋图强、自力更生，一方面加上公社和兄弟队的援助，落后队才能在短短的时间内由穷变富，赶上先进。
    希望所有的落后队都能像苍梧这二十七个大队一样，发奋图强、自力更生。也希望所有的公社都能像苍梧县各个公社一样，充分发挥公社的优越性，从各方面加强落后队，帮助落后队，使落后队能在比较短的时间内赶上先进。
