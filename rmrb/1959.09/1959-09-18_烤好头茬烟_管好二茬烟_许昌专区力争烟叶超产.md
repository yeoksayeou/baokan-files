Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 17th: Xuchang Prefecture in Henan has harvested and cured over 70% of its early tobacco, and the late tobacco is being cured on a large scale. In order to strive for increased production of more tobacco leaves, farmers throughout the region are actively responding to the Party's call for increased production and economy, and are vigorously carrying out a tobacco leaf overproduction campaign centered on retaining the second crop of tobacco.

This year, Xuchang Prefecture planted 1.17 million mu of tobacco, an increase of 16.4% compared to last year. The characteristics of this year's tobacco leaf production are early harvest, high yield, and good quality. Retaining the second crop of tobacco is a successful experience that farmers in Xuchang Prefecture have explored since 1954 to ensure increased production of flue-cured tobacco. The method is: after the first crop of early tobacco is cured to the top of the shed, the second crop of tobacco buds are retained, the old stalks are removed, water and fertilizer are added, and cultivation management is strengthened. Soon, tobacco plants with twenty to thirty-five leaves will grow, with a growth period of only forty days or more. The yield per mu is over 100 jin, and in many cases can reach more than 300 jin, and it does not affect wheat planting.

Inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Xuchang Prefecture has launched a large-scale tobacco overproduction campaign. The first crop of tobacco is being harvested and cured at an accelerated pace, and the second crop has already been retained on 590,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by 18%. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the growth, harvesting, curing, and retention of the second crop of tobacco in the region, has already proposed a fighting goal: to strive for a 56% increase in production compared to last year, requiring all localities to quickly cure tobacco, quickly cut stalks, quickly retain branches, quickly water, quickly fertilize, and quickly manage, so that the first crop of tobacco is well cured, no leaf is lost, and the second crop is well managed, ensuring increased production.

### 烤好头茬烟　管好二茬烟  许昌专区力争烟叶超产

    烤好头茬烟　管好二茬烟
    许昌专区力争烟叶超产
    据新华社郑州17日电　河南许昌专区早烟已收烤70％以上，晚烟正在大烤。为了争取增产更多的烟叶，全区农民积极响应党的增产节约号召，正在大力开展以留二茬烟为中心的烟叶超产运动。
    许昌专区今年种烟一百一十七万亩，比去年增加16.4％。今年烟叶生产的特点是收获早、产量高、质量好。留二茬烟是许昌专区农民从1954年以来摸索出来的保证烤烟增产的成功经验。办法是：在头茬早烟烤到顶棚，把二茬烟芽留下，铲去老杆，加水加肥，加强中耕管理，很快就会长起二十—三十五片叶子的烟棵，生长期只四十多天，单产在百斤以上，多者能达三百多斤，而且不影响种麦。
    在党的八届八中全会公报和决议鼓舞下，许昌专区掀起了规模巨大的烤烟超产运动。头茬烟正在加紧收烤，二茬烟已留五十九万亩，超过原订计划18％。中共许昌地委根据全区烤烟的生长、收烤和留二茬烟的情况，已经提出奋斗目标：争取比去年增产五成六，要求各地快烤烟、快割杆、快留杈、快浇水、快施肥、快管理，做到头茬烟烤好，片叶不丢，二茬烟管好，保证增产。
