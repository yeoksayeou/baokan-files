Dear Comrades:
    The tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is an immortal and glorious day for the heroic Chinese Communist Party and the valiant Chinese people, and a day of pride and joy for the international workers' movement and all peace-loving friends in the world. Dear comrades, please accept the warm, militant greetings of the Communist Party of Germany and the heartfelt congratulations of the progressive workers, peasants, intellectuals, and citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany!
    Leibniz, an outstanding German humanist thinker, was a propagandist for Chinese wisdom, and Goethe, the greatest poet of German humanism, was a singer of Chinese beauty. Inspired by the spirit of friendship and unity between our two peoples, we understand how to inherit this noble legacy of German humanism. Inspired by this spirit, we carried forward the finest traditions of the German workers' movement. In the 1920s, the German workers' movement, under the slogan of "No Aggression Against China," launched a powerful campaign against imperialist aggression against China, and powerfully demonstrated solidarity with the Chinese people's struggle for freedom and independence.
    In contrast, how pitiful and sinful was the statement of a German emperor of the imperialist era at the end of the last century who ordered soldiers to make the name of Germany inspire terror in China for thousands of years. You have eradicated this shame; the archway built in Beijing at that time to publicize imperialist arrogance is now replaced with the words "Defend Peace!"
    This symbolizes your historically significant achievements: China has transformed from a country suffering from bloody oppression and colonial exploitation into a free and strong People's Republic, a powerful bastion of peace and socialism.
    We have followed this path with great admiration: we share your sorrows in your setbacks and rejoice with you in your victories. On the tenth anniversary of the victory of the Chinese revolution, these thoughts occupy our minds:
    That is the costly battles of Guangzhou and Shanghai, the glorious victories over the Japanese invaders, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and the imperialist aggressors in Korea; that is the long march that has long become a myth and the Great Leap Forward of 1958; that is the labor heroism in seizing the iron chain bridge over the Dadu River and building the Yellow River Dam and the Wuhan Bridge; that is Mao Zedong's writings, how to use and enrich the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism; that is the battle to eliminate illiteracy and ignorance and the heroic songs of Anshan steelworkers and farmers in the Northeast reclamation area.
    On such a day, what else can we hope for besides the eternal friendship between our people, our country, and the various nationalities of the great New China! What higher goal do we have to strive for than to strive for our working class and our people to open up the path that you have already taken, the path to liberation from imperialist arrogance, from suffering and war, and to achieve great national dignity and world status through the cause of peace.
    The German imperialists and militarists, the culprits of two world wars and two national disasters, are still obstructing the path to progress in our country. They are still clamoring for revenge for their defeat; they are still taking up destructive atomic weapons with criminal hands.
    However, due to past experience and understanding of the current situation, the forces of peace and democracy in the Federal Republic of Germany are also growing. On German soil, in the homeland of Marx and Engels, a country of peace and socialism has been established - our German Democratic Republic, which, like the People's Republic of China, is celebrating its tenth anniversary these days.
    In this way, the cornerstone of the socialist world system is deeply planted in the West on German soil, and you, dear comrades, have built a giant pillar of the socialist system on the shores of the Pacific Ocean thousands of miles away from us. Between us is the central hub of the socialist camp, the great Soviet Union, whose various nationalities, under the leadership of the glorious Leninist Party of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are rushing towards the peak of communism. This is a force that now enables mankind to envision the prospect of freedom from the burden of armaments and the threat of war, and the bright future of lasting peace.
    On such happy days, how can we, the communists of West Germany and the progressive people of our country, not be most closely united with you, our dear comrades, and the people of all China! Our hearts beat for this common and most lofty endeavor, for the common highest ideal.
    Therefore, dear comrades and friends, as we congratulate you on this proud and victorious day, please accept our assurance that we are inseparably united with you and fight together for the cause of peace and progress! We are confident that after taking the initial difficult but such great steps in construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, your country will enter a faster and larger-scale socialist construction upsurge, and finally transition to communism.
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the organizer of all victories! Long live Comrade Mao Zedong! Glory to the workers, peasants and intellectuals of the People's Republic of China who bravely rush to the peak of socialism!
    Long live the growing friendship between the Chinese and German people!
    Long live proletarian internationalism! Long live our unbreakable unity with our great teacher, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!
    Forward to new victories under the banner of Marx, Engels and Lenin!
                            First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany
                                    Max Reimann

### 德国共产党中央委员会的贺信

1959-09-30

专栏：

    德国共产党中央委员会的贺信敬爱的同志们：
    中华人民共和国建国十周年是英雄的中国共产党和英勇的中国人民的不朽的光荣的日子，是国际工人运动和世界上所有爱好和平的朋友们值得骄傲和高兴的日子。敬爱的同志们，为此请接受德国共产党热烈的战斗的敬礼和德意志联邦共和国进步工人、农民、知识分子和公民们的衷心祝贺！
    德国人文主义的杰出的思想家莱布尼兹是中国智慧的宣传者，德国人文主义的最伟大的诗人歌德是关于中国之美的歌颂者，在我们两国人民的友谊和团结的精神的鼓舞下，我们很懂得继承德国人文主义的这种高贵遗产。在这种精神的鼓舞下，我们发扬了德国工人运动最优秀的传统，在二十年代，德国工人运动在“不许侵略中国”的口号下展开了反对帝国主义侵略中国的强有力的行动，并且有力地表现出对于中国人民争取自由和独立的斗争的团结一致。
    与此相反，帝国主义时代的一个德国皇帝在上世纪末命令士兵说，要让德国人这个名称在中国千百年间一提起来就胆战心惊，这句话是多么可怜、多么罪恶。你们铲除了这一耻辱；当时在北京建立起来的宣扬帝国主义横行霸道的牌坊上现在换上了“保卫和平！”的字样。
    这象征着你们具有历史意义的功业：中国从遭受血腥压迫、殖民剥削的国家变成了自由强盛的人民共和国，变成了和平和社会主义的强大堡垒。
    我们以十分景仰的心情，伴着你们走过了这条道路：我们为你们的挫败和你们共忧患，我们为你们的胜利和你们同欢乐。在中国革命胜利十周年的时候，这些思想萦绕我们脑际：
    那就是广州和上海的牺牲惨重的战斗，打败日本侵略者、打败蒋介石卖国集团、打败朝鲜的帝国主义侵略者的辉煌胜利；那就是久已成为神话般的长征和一九五八年的大跃进；那就是强夺大渡河上的铁索桥和黄河大堤及武汉大桥建造中的劳动英雄气概；那就是毛泽东的著作，这是如何运用和丰富马克思列宁主义的宝库；那就是消灭文盲和愚昧的战斗以及鞍山钢铁工人和东北农垦区农民们的英雄歌曲。
    在这样的日子，我们除了希望我们的人民、我们的国家和伟大的新中国的各族人民的友谊永久长存外，还能希望一些什么呢！我们还有什么更高的目标要我们来努力争取的呢，只有争取我们的工人阶级、我们的人民在不久以后也开辟出这条你们已经走过了的道路，这条道路就是从帝国主义的横行霸道、从苦难和战争中解放出来，通过和平事业，达到民族的伟大尊严和世界地位。
    两次世界大战和两次民族灾难的罪魁——德国帝国主义者和军国主义者还在我国阻挡着前进的道路。他们还在叫嚣着要为他们的失败复仇；他们还在用犯罪的手拿起毁灭性的原子武器。
    但是，由于过去的经验和对目前形势的认识，德意志联邦共和国的和平和民主的力量也在增长。在德国的土地上、在马克思和恩格斯的祖国，已经成立了一个和平和社会主义的国家——我们的德意志民主共和国，它正像中华人民共和国一样在这几天里庆祝它的建国十周年。
    这样，社会主义世界体系的角柱就在德国的土地上深入地插在西方，而你们，亲爱的同志们，就在远离我们几千公里的太平洋岸边建立起社会主义体系的巨柱。在我们之间有社会主义阵营的中心枢纽联系着，这就是伟大的苏联，它的各族人民在苏联共产党这个光荣的列宁的党的领导下正在冲向共产主义的高峰。这就是一种力量，它现在使人类能够展望免除军备重担与战争威胁的远景和永久和平的美好前途。
    在这样幸福的日子里，我们西德的共产党员和我国的进步人士怎能不和你们，我们敬爱的同志们，以及全中国的人民最亲密地联合在一起呢！我们的心都为这共同的最崇高的努力、为共同的最高理想而跳动着。
    因此，敬爱的同志们和朋友们，在我们对这个值得骄傲的胜利的日子祝贺的时候，请接受我们的保证，我们为和平和进步事业和你们牢不可破地团结在一起，战斗在一起！我们确信，你们国家在中国共产党领导下随着建设事业跨出了最初是艰巨的而又是这样巨大的步伐之后，将进入更为迅速、规模更为宏大的社会主义建设高潮，终于过渡到共产主义。
    一切胜利的组织者中国共产党万岁！毛泽东同志万岁！光荣归于勇敢冲向社会主义高峰的中华人民共和国的工人、农民和知识分子！
    中德人民友谊不断增长万岁！
    无产阶级国际主义万岁！我们和我们的伟大导师苏联共产党的牢不可破的团结万岁！
    在马克思、恩格斯和列宁的旗帜下向着新的胜利前进！
                            德国共产党中央委员会第一书记
                                    马克斯·雷曼
