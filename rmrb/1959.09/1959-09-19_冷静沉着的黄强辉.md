    Calm and Composed Huang Qianghui
    Huang Qianghui, who has maintained the national lightweight championship for several years, won the lightweight championship at the first National Games on the 16th.
    Huang Qianghui's technique is comprehensive, and he has a prominent advantage, which is calmness and composure. This advantage has helped him turn danger into safety and turn defeat into victory several times in critical moments. The lightweight championship battle on the evening of the 16th was a prominent example. After pushing up 110 kilograms, he did not ask for another lift. When the snatch started, he wanted 110 kilograms, but the center of gravity of the barbell was too far back twice, and he failed. If the third attempt failed, he would not even have a total score, and the audience was sweating for him. But he was calm and confident, and finally lifted the weight on his third attempt. His competitive condition was not good that day, and he failed twice to clean and jerk 150 kilograms, and the audience was once again anxious for him. However, Huang Qianghui resolutely walked to the barbell and steadily lifted the barbell over his head.
    Weightlifting instructors, when talking about Huang Qianghui, unanimously agreed on his advantages. People believe: "There are two kinds of people in competitions, one is burdened with heavy baggage, afraid of losing face; the other is calm and composed, summarizing experience, and forging ahead bravely, with only one belief: how to lift the barbell. Huang Qianghui belongs to the latter category."
    Huang Qianghui has the same aspirations as many athletes. He once wrote: "The Party's usual care and guidance is the driving force for my progress. I want to create higher records with my working hands and win glory for the motherland!"
    A young man with such lofty ideals, comprehensive skills, and a calm and composed mind in the face of the competition, people can expect him to climb to even greater heights.

    冷静沉着的黄强辉
    几年来一直保持着轻量级全国冠军的黄强辉，16日又获得第一届全国运动会轻量级冠军。
    黄强辉的技术全面，并且有着一个突出的优点，那就是冷静和沉着。这个优点好几次在紧要的关头使他化险为夷，转败为胜。16日晚上轻量级冠军之战，就是一个突出的例子。当他推起一百一十公斤之后，没有要求再举。抓举开始，他要了一百一十公斤，但两次杠铃重心都靠后而失败，第三次试举如果失败，就连总成绩也没有了，观众替他捏了一把冷汗。但他从容不迫，满怀信心，在第三次试举时终于把这个重量举起来。这一天他竞技状况并不好，两次挺举一百五十公斤都告失败，观众再一次替他着急万分。可是黄强辉毅然走到杠铃旁，稳健地把杠铃举过头顶。
    举重指导们在谈到黄强辉时，都异口同声地赞同他的优点。人们认为：“比赛中有两种人，一种是包袱重重，就怕输了见不得人；一种是冷静沉着，总结经验，勇往直前，只有一个信念：如何把杠铃举起来。黄强辉就是属于后一类的。”
    黄强辉有着同许许多多运动员一样的心愿，他曾这样写道：“党平时的关怀教导是我前进的动力，我要用劳动的双手创更高纪录，为祖国争光！”
    一个青年人有这种远大的理想，有着全面的技术，加上临场不慌，冷静沉着的头脑，人们可以预期，他会攀向更高的顶峰。
