People's Daily, Changsha, September 13th: (Reporters Liao Daowei and Wei Changwang) The small blast furnace groups established in Shaoyang Prefecture, Hunan Province, during the mass movement of the Great Leap Forward for steelmaking last year, have shown strong vitality after a year of practice.

The eighty-six small blast furnaces with a volume of 810 cubic meters that have been built in this prefecture have seen their opening rate increase from 60% in July to 83%. In late August, the average daily production of pig iron was 445 tons, and the average utilization coefficient reached 0.74. The average utilization coefficient of iron plants in Lengshuijiang, Anping, Renhe, and Shaodong is close to 1. The No. 1 small blast furnace in Taipingli Iron Plant has a utilization coefficient of 1.2. From January to August this year, the district produced more than 97,000 tons of pig iron, of which more than 90% was low-sulfur, low-phosphorus cast iron. Because these pig irons have a sulfur content of less than 0.2%, a phosphorus content of less than 0.05%, and a silicon content of about 1.5%, they sell well all over the country and have been widely praised by users everywhere. In terms of reducing coal consumption, the district has reduced from an average of more than 2 tons of coke consumed per ton of iron in the past to 1.6 tons. The Lengshuijiang Iron Plant consumes only 0.944 tons of coke per ton of iron. Due to the substantial reduction in coking coal, the average cost per ton of pig iron in July and August was reduced from 247 yuan in the first quarter to 200 yuan, which made the district's steel production show a new situation of high output, high quality, low coking coal, and low cost.

Shaoyang Prefecture is a place with a weak industrial base of steel. By the end of 1957, there were only more than 50 earthenware furnaces in the entire district. The most important reason why the district's steel production can achieve rapid development in the case of a weak foundation and imperfect conditions in all aspects is that in the mass movement of vigorous steelmaking last year, the policy of the whole party and the whole people making steel was conscientiously implemented, and a massive mass movement for vigorously developing the steel industry by the whole people was launched. Last year, more than one million people in the district went to the mountains to mine and dig coal, and earthenware furnaces blossomed everywhere, making it possible to basically clarify the district's abundant coal and iron resources in a short period of time, and enabling various places to establish seven key iron plants in places with appropriate resource conditions. The mass movement of vigorous steelmaking last year enabled the broad masses to learn technology and knowledge, and the broad cadres gained experience, which cultivated a large number of excellent ironmaking workers, technicians, and management personnel for this year's steel production, so that farmers and cadres who had never seen ironmaking furnaces in the past could gradually master the operating technology of small blast furnaces, handle accidents, and manage iron plants and coal mines. In the past, there was only one worker in Shaodong Iron Plant who knew a little about ironmaking technology in earthenware furnaces. Now, in addition to more than 200 people in the plant who can master the smelting technology of small blast furnaces, it has also trained more than 400 technicians for other counties and factories.

After the small blast furnaces were established, in order to rapidly increase the output and quality of pig iron, various iron plants widely carried out mass-based technical innovation campaigns. Among the small blast furnaces that have been put into operation in the district, 86% have promoted the advanced experience of using quicklime instead of limestone as an ironmaking flux. After Anping Iron Plant in Lianyuan County promoted this advanced method, the daily output of pig iron increased from 25 tons to 29 tons, the coke ratio decreased from 1.2 to 1, and the sulfur content of pig iron decreased from 0.11% to 0.067%.

After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the vast number of workers on the steel front in Shaoyang Prefecture were in high spirits and their enthusiasm was multiplied. The district quickly launched a vigorous increase production and practice economy campaign. The daily output of pig iron from the Lengshuijiang Iron Plant used to stay at around 20 tons. Recently, the entire plant's employees focused on breaking through the two key production points of power and transportation. Since late August, the daily output has often been maintained at the level of 67 tons, an increase of two to three times compared to the past. (Attached picture)

### 邵阳大办钢铁的事实证明  小高炉合乎人群需要

    邵阳大办钢铁的事实证明
    小高炉合乎人群需要
    本报长沙13日电　记者廖道维、魏昌旺报道：湖南省邵阳专区在去年全民大炼钢铁的群众运动中建立起来的小高炉群，经过一年来的实践，已经显示了强大的生命力。
    这个专区已经建成的八十六座容积为八百一十立方米的小高炉，目前的开炉率已由7月份的60％增加到83％，8月下旬平均日产生铁四百四十五吨，平均利用系数达到零点七四，冷水江、安平、人和、邵东等铁厂的平均利用系数都接近一。太平里铁厂的一号小高炉利用系数达到一点二。今年1月至8月，全区共生产了生铁九万七千多吨，其中有90％以上是低硫低磷的铸造生铁。这些生铁由于含硫量均在0.2％以下，含磷在0.05％以下，含矽1.5％左右，因而畅销全国各地，得到了各地用户的普遍赞扬。在降低煤耗方面，全区由过去炼一吨铁平均消耗焦炭二吨多降低为一点六吨，冷水江铁厂炼一吨铁仅消耗零点九四四吨焦。由于焦煤大大降低，7、8月份每吨生铁的平均成本由一季度的二百四十七元降低到二百元，使全区在钢铁生产上，出现了产量高、质量高、焦煤低，成本低的新局面。
    邵阳专区是一个钢铁工业基础薄弱的地方，到1957年年底，全区还只有五十多座甑炉。全区钢铁生产能够在基础薄弱，各方面条件都不完善的情况下，获得飞跃发展，最主要的是由于在去年大炼钢铁的运动中，认真的贯彻了全党全民炼钢铁的方针，掀起了声势浩大的全民大办钢铁工业的群众运动。去年全区一百多万人上山采矿挖煤，土炉遍地开花，使全区丰富的煤铁资源，有可能在短时间内基本弄清，并使各地能够在资源条件适当的地方，建立起七个重点铁厂。去年大炼钢铁的群众运动，使广大群众学到了技术和知识，广大干部取得了经验，为今年钢铁生产培养了大批优秀的炼铁工人、技术人员和管理人员，使过去从来没有看到过炼铁炉的农民和干部，能够逐渐掌握小高炉的操作技术，处理事故和管理铁厂、煤矿。邵东铁厂过去只有一位懂一点土炉炼铁技术的工人，现在除了本厂已经有二百多人能掌握小高炉的冶炼技术外，还为外县、外厂培训了四百多个技术人员。
    小高炉建立起来以后，为了迅速提高生铁的产量和质量，各铁厂广泛地开展了群众性的技术革新运动。在全区已经开工生产的小高炉中，有86％推行了以生石灰代替石灰石作炼铁溶剂的先进经验。涟源县安平铁厂推行了这一先进办法后，生铁日产量由二十五吨提高到二十九吨，焦比由一点二降低到一，生铁含硫量由0.11％降低到0.067％。
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布以后，邵阳专区钢铁战线上的广大职工意气风发，干劲倍增，全区迅速掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。冷水江铁厂原先生铁日产量经常停留在二十吨左右，最近全厂职工集中产量突破动力、运输两大生产关键，8月下旬以来，日产量经常保持在六十七吨的水平，比过去增产二至三倍。（附图片）
