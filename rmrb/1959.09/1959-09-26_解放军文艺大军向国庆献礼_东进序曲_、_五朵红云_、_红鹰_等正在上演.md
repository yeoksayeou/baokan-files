The People's Liberation Army's professional and amateur literary and art workers from various units are participating in the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with the greatest enthusiasm, drive, and creativity, presenting performances in the capital's literary and art circles.

These celebratory programs are almost entirely new creations since the Great Leap Forward and have been carefully refined and improved after being reviewed by the Second All-Army Literary and Art Festival. Among them is the large-scale drama "Overture to the Eastward Advance," which has received widespread attention and praise from literary and art circles in the capital. Based on true historical facts, it uses superb artistic conception to successfully create a group of vivid characters, praising the glorious victory of the New Fourth Army's Advance Column, which advanced eastward to fight against Japan during the War of Resistance Against Japan, adhered to the War of Resistance, and adhered to the Party's anti-Japanese national united front policy. The large-scale dance drama "Five Red Clouds," which reflects the struggle of the Li people of Hainan Island against the Kuomintang reactionaries, has a strong national style and a strong ideological character, and has been unanimously praised by the audience as a red flower in China's dance drama creation. The large-scale dance drama "Butterfly Loves Flowers," adapted from Chairman Mao's poem "Butterfly Loves Flowers," also better reflects the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in the original poem. The drama "Huai Shu Village" is a new work by playwright Hu Ke. Through the tremendous changes in Huai Shu Village from land reform to agricultural cooperation to the establishment of people's communes, it vividly reflects the great achievements of socialist transformation in China's rural areas over the past ten years. "On the 38th Parallel" is an unforgettable historical comedy about the Chinese and Korean people struggling against the conspiracies and sabotage of American imperialism on the armistice line after the victory of the Korean War. The most outstanding opera "Red Eagle" from the All-Army Literary and Art Festival and the new opera "Red Sun on Ke Mountain" by playwright Chen Qitong sing moving praises for the Party's ethnic policies and the Tibetan people's liberation struggle.

The powerful PLA Joint Song and Dance Troupe, Joint Acrobatic Troupe, Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department, which bring together outstanding programs from the literary and art troupes of the entire army, and the PLA's First and Second Amateur Performance Teams, which bring together outstanding amateur literary and art programs from the entire army, have also prepared many signature programs to celebrate National Day. These include the magnificent chorus "Long Live the Motherland," the "Battlefield Music" that fully demonstrates the revolutionary optimism and creativity of the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the orchestral performance "Millions of Brave Troops Cross the Yangtze River," the beautiful dances "Crane Dance," "Drum Dance," "Cotton Planting Girl," "Immortal Warrior," "Flowers Blooming in the People's Commune," and "Night at the Reservoir," as well as the passionate poetry performances "Remembering General Yang Jingyu" and "Unforgettable Voyage," and many other wonderful folk songs, music, and acrobatics.

All these programs, in a posture of "letting a hundred flowers bloom," fully demonstrate the epic of the People's Army's heroic struggle under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao for more than 30 years, and the heroic image of being loyal to the motherland and loyal to the people from all aspects. At the same time, they also enthusiastically praise the glorious achievements of the great motherland's socialist construction.

Many famous army actors have participated in this glorious celebratory performance. Famous drama actor Lan Ma, with his more than 20 years of stage art achievements, portrayed the sinister and cunning American Colonel Davis in the drama "On the 38th Parallel." Famous "Shandong Kuaishu" actor Gao Yuanjun wrote and performed "Fierce Battle in the Sky," vividly depicting the image of the People's Air Force fighters, the heroic defenders of the motherland's airspace. Actress Hu Peng, who was well-known for playing Zhang Zhijian's heroic mother in the movie "Iron Warrior," played the protagonist Aunt Guo in the drama "Huai Shu Village" this time. Zhang Changcheng, winner of the gold medal at the 6th World Youth Festival, also showed his great skill in this performance, playing several wonderful banhu solos. Actress Zhang Yingzhe's solo "Butterfly Loves Flowers" has made gratifying achievements in combining the national singing method of the motherland and the traditional Western singing method. Zou Min, Su Weilan, and Xu Youguang's solo songs in different styles are also very popular.

The literary and art workers and amateur literary and art workers of the People's Liberation Army are participating in the great 10th anniversary National Day celebration performance, and they have received enthusiastic concern and help from the officers and soldiers of the entire army. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, under the leadership of the Party committees and leaders at all levels of the army, the literary and art workers of the army have gone down to the companies as soldiers, up to the mountains and down to the countryside, throwing themselves into the fiery wave of life and struggle, learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and performing for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, opening up an infinitely rich source of creation. The excellent dramas "Overture to the Eastward Advance," "On the 38th Parallel," "Huai Shu Village," the dance dramas "Five Red Clouds" and "Butterfly Loves Flowers," the dance "Immortal Warrior," and the song "Long Live the Motherland" were all born under the care and guidance of the Party committees and leaders of the army, and on the basis of the literary and art workers delving into life. Before rehearsing the opera "Red Eagle," the authors and actors lived closely with the Tibetan people on the Gannan Grassland for a period of time, deeply familiarizing themselves with the thoughts, feelings, and living habits of the Tibetan people, thus achieving the success of creation and performance.

    解放军文艺大军向国庆献礼
    “东进序曲”、“五朵红云”、“红鹰”等正在上演
    本报讯　来自人民解放军各部队专业和业余的文艺工作者们，以最大的热情、干劲和创造精神，参加文艺界在首都举行的庆祝建国十周年献礼演出。
    这些献礼的节目，几乎全部是大跃进以来的新创作，并且在经过全军第二届文艺会演的检阅以后，又精心地作了加工和提高。其中有受到首都文艺界广泛重视和赞扬的大型话剧“东进序曲”，它依据真实的历史事实，以精湛的艺术构思，成功地塑造了一批栩栩如生的人物形象，歌颂了抗日战争时期东进抗日的新四军挺进纵队，坚持抗战、坚持党的抗日民族统一战线政策的光辉胜利。以反映海南岛黎族人民和国民党反动派的斗争为题材的大型舞剧“五朵红云”，具有浓厚的民族风格和强烈的思想性，受到观众的一致好评，认为是我国舞剧创作中的一朵红花。根据毛主席的“蝶恋花”词编成的大型舞剧“蝶恋花”，也较好地体现了原词中革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义结合的精神。话剧“槐树庄”，是剧作家胡可的新作。他通过槐树庄这个地方从土地改革到农业合作化到成立人民公社的巨大变迁，形象地反映了我国农村十年来进行社会主义改造的伟大成就。“在三八线上”，是一出使人难忘的中、朝两国人民，在朝鲜战争胜利以后，在停战线上与美帝国主义的阴谋破坏作斗争的历史喜剧。全军文艺会演中最优秀的歌剧“红鹰”和剧作家陈其通的新作歌剧“柯山红日”，为党的民族政策和藏族人民的解放斗争，唱出了动人的赞歌。
    阵容强大的集中了全军文工团优秀节目的解放军联合歌舞团、联合杂技团、总政治部文工团歌舞团和集中了全军优秀的业余文艺节目的解放军第一、第二业余演出队，也为国庆献礼准备了许多拿手好戏。这里有声势雄壮的大合唱“祖国万岁”，有充分显示中国人民志愿军战士的革命乐观主义和创造精神的“战地音乐”，有管弦乐演奏“百万雄师下江南”，有优美的舞蹈“仙鹤舞”、“鼓舞”、“植棉姑娘”、“不朽的战士”、“人民公社鲜花开”和“水库的夜晚”等，也有激情的诗表演“怀念杨靖宇将军”和“难忘的航行”，以及其他许多精彩的民歌、音乐和杂技等节目。
    所有这些节目，都以“百花齐放”的姿态，从各个方面，把人民军队在党和毛主席的英明领导下，三十多年来英勇斗争的史诗和忠于祖国、忠于人民的英雄形象，充分地表现了出来。同时，也热情歌颂了伟大祖国社会主义建设的光辉成就。
    许多有名的部队演员都参加了这次光荣的献礼演出。话剧名演员蓝马，以他二十多年的舞台艺术成就，塑造了“在三八线上”话剧中的阴险、狡滑的美军上校台维斯。“山东快书”名演员高元钧，自编自演的“长空激战”，把祖国领空的英雄保卫者——人民空军战士的形象，作了形象的描绘。早在电影“钢铁战士”中以扮演张志坚的英雄母亲闻名的女演员胡朋，这次又在话剧“槐树庄”中扮演了主角郭大娘。第六届世界青年联欢节金质奖章获得者张长城，也在这次演出中大显身手，演奏了好几个精彩的板胡独奏曲。女演员张映哲的独唱“蝶恋花”，在接受祖国民族唱法和西洋传统唱法结合上，这次更有了可喜的成就。邹敏、苏威兰、徐有光的不同风格的独唱曲，也很受欢迎。
    人民解放军的文艺工作者和业余文艺工作者们参加伟大的建国十周年献礼演出，受到全军官兵的热烈关怀和帮助。去年大跃进以来，部队的文艺工作者们就在部队各级党委和首长的领导下，纷纷下连当兵，上山下乡，投身到火热的生活斗争浪潮中去，向工农兵群众学习，为工农兵群众演出，开拓了无限丰富的创作泉源。优秀的话剧“东进序曲”、“三八线上”、“槐树庄”，舞剧“五朵红云”和“蝶恋花”，舞蹈“不朽的战士”，歌曲“祖国万岁”等，都是在部队党委和首长的关怀和指导下，在文艺工作者们深入生活的基础上诞生的。歌剧“红鹰”的作者和演员们，在排演之前，曾到甘南草原上和藏胞一起亲密生活了一段时间，深入地熟悉了藏族人民的思想感情和生活习惯，因而获得了创作和演出的成功。（附图片）
