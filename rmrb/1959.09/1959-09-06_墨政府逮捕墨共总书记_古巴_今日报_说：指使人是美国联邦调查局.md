Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 4th. According to "Latin American News Agency", the General Secretary of the Mexican Communist Party, Dionisio Encina, was arrested by the Mexican authorities in Torreón, Coahuila.

The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published a commentary on this matter, stating that the arrest of the General Secretary of the Mexican Communist Party occurred amidst increasingly terroristic measures taken by the Mexican government against workers and the people's movement. Prior to this, many Mexican railway workers and teachers were arrested for defending the free rights of laborers, and some of them are still in prison. The Mexican government's reason for arresting Dionisio Encina is the same, namely that the Mexican Communist Party has consistently fought to support the just demands of workers and ordinary people and to protest against the persecution by the police authorities. It is not difficult to see that the arrest of the General Secretary of the Mexican Communist Party was carried out under the behind-the-scenes instigation of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.

"Hoy" expressed strong "protest against the unreasonable arrest of Dionisio Encina, who has led the Communist Party countless times in loudly supporting the Cuban people."

    墨政府逮捕墨共总书记
    古巴“今日报”说：指使人是美国联邦调查局
    新华社哈瓦那4日电　据“拉丁美洲通讯社”报道，墨西哥共产党总书记迪奥尼西奥·恩西纳在科阿韦拉州的托伦被墨西哥当局逮捕。
    古巴“今日报”就这件事发表评论说，逮捕墨西哥共产党总书记是在墨西哥政府对工人和人民运动日益采取恐怖措施的情况下发生的。在这以前，许多墨西哥铁路工人和教师由于保卫劳动者的自由权利而遭到逮捕，他们之中有一部分人至今还在监狱里。墨西哥政府之所以要逮捕迪奥尼西奥·恩西纳也是出于同样的理由，那就是墨西哥共产党一贯为支持工人和普通人民的正当要求和抗议警察当局的迫害而斗争。不难看出，逮捕墨西哥共产党总书记是在美国联邦调查局的幕后指使下做出来的。
    “今日报”表示强烈“抗议无理逮捕迪奥尼西奥·恩西纳，他曾领导共产党无数次地大声疾呼，支持古巴人民”。
