Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th. Dubrovinina, Vice Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, said at a celebration party for China's National Day that the Chinese people achieved unprecedented achievements in history in 1958. This achievement should be attributed to the Great Leap Forward implemented by the Chinese people, the enthusiasm of all working people, and the General Line for socialist construction formulated by the Chinese Communist Party, which calls for going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
	She also said that recently, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held the Eighth Plenary Session, which discussed issues such as further developing the national economy and increasing production and practicing economy. The plenary session verified the achievements of 1958 and the main indicators for 1959. From the verified statistics of industrial and agricultural output in 1958, it can be seen that the Chinese people still achieved a Great Leap Forward in 1958. The most obvious are the output of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and the emergence of people's communes in rural areas. Those who do not believe in the Great Leap Forward should open their eyes and look at the facts.
	This party was jointly organized by the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and the Sokolniki Park Administration to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of China.
	When talking about the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, Dubrovinina said that this friendship is developing day by day. The Soviet people are sincerely happy for the achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction.
	She concluded by saying that we firmly believe that the 600 million Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will continue to realize their ideals of advancing towards the path of socialism and communism.
	Soviet painter Klimashin, who had visited China, and Zhang Yingwu, Cultural Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, also spoke at the meeting.
	Representatives of working people from all walks of life in Moscow, Chinese students, and Chinese tourists visiting Moscow attended the party, numbering in the hundreds. Famous artists from Moscow and Chinese students performed at the party.

    苏中友协副主席在庆祝我国国庆晚会上说
    中国人民去年的空前成就应归功于总路线和大跃进
    新华社莫斯科电　苏中友好协会理事会副主席杜伯洛维娜13日晚在一次庆祝我国国庆节的晚会上说，1958年中国人民取得了历史上空前的成就，这一成就应归功于中国人民实现的大跃进，全体劳动人民的积极性和中国共产党所制定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。
    她又说，不久前，中国共产党中央委员会举行了八中全会，讨论了进一步发展国民经济和增产节约等问题。全会核实了1958年的成就和1959年主要指标，从核实后的1958年工农业产量的统计中可以看出，中国人民在1958年仍然是实现了大跃进。最明显的是钢、煤、粮、棉的产量和人民公社在农村的出现。那些不相信大跃进的人们应该睁开眼睛看一看事实。
    这个晚会是为了庆祝中国建国十周年由苏中友协和索科尔尼基公园管理处联合举办的。
    杜伯洛维娜在谈到苏中两国人民的友谊时说，这一友谊正在日益发展。苏联人民衷心为中国人民在社会主义建设中所获得的成就而高兴。
    她最后说，我们完全相信，六亿中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，将继续实现他们向社会主义和共产主义道路前进的理想。
    在会上讲话的还有曾到过中国的苏联画家克利马申和中国驻苏联大使馆文化参赞张映吾等。
    参加晚会的有莫斯科各界劳动人民的代表，中国留学生和正在莫斯科参观的中国旅行者等数百人。晚会上，莫斯科的著名艺术家和中国留学生演出了节目。
