Half-Monthly International Review
(From August 16th to 31st)

    The Socialist Camp: Growing Stronger and More United

    The socialist countries achieved tremendous development in their national economies in the first half of this year. Production communiques recently released by various countries show that the industrial development of all socialist countries is very rapid.

    The communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out that China's total industrial output value in the first half of this year increased by 65% compared with the same period last year; in agriculture, the average yield per unit area of summer crops has been improved, and the total output of wheat, early rice, and rapeseed has exceeded last year's exceptionally good harvest. It is entirely possible to complete the main targets of the original Second Five-Year Plan (1962) in terms of major industrial and agricultural products ahead of schedule within this year. Recently, the Central Standing Committee of the Korean Workers' Party held an enlarged meeting, proposing the policy of further developing local industries and establishing a system of central and local industries, in order to reorganize forces for the second Five-Year Plan starting in 1961. This half-month marks the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Romania. In just fifteen years, Romania has been built into an advanced industrial and agricultural country. From 1948 to 1958, Romania's total industrial output value increased by 3.6 times, with an average annual growth rate of 16.5%. Socialist countries are raising the socialist competition to a new stage. The working people of the Soviet Union and many socialist countries are enthusiastically learning from the example of Gaganova to help the backward move forward together. Czechoslovakia is launching a mass movement to save investment and accelerate the speed of socialist construction. Workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises throughout Poland are launching a movement to discuss the next Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), and many industrial and mining enterprises are tapping production potential and increasing production targets. All the above-mentioned situations indicate that the strength of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is increasing day by day.

    At the same time, the unity and cooperation among socialist countries have been further consolidated and developed. The frequent mutual visits and talks between party and government leaders of socialist countries, as well as the exchanges of various economic, cultural and other delegations in the first half of this year, illustrate this point. Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, took a vacation in the Soviet Union and visited China on his way back home; the Mongolian party and government delegation headed by Tsedenbal is visiting Vietnam; the delegation of the National People's Congress of China is also visiting Mongolia; in addition, the Chinese government delegation went to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia for visits and inspections. In terms of economic mutual assistance and cooperation, the recently successfully designed overall plan for the construction of a large oil pipeline running through the five countries of the Soviet Union, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary is a new example.

    As the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out: the strength of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and their unity and cooperation are increasing day by day. This is very beneficial to China's realization of a continued leap forward in the national economy.

    Eisenhower Faces a Delicate Situation

    In contrast to the continuous strengthening of unity among socialist countries and the flourishing socialist construction, the difficulties and contradictions within the imperialist camp have continued to grow recently. "The New York Times" wrote: Now "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization itself is being hit by unprecedented quarrels, competitions, and suspicions among allies."

    The open and covert struggles among Western countries are particularly manifested in the relations between France, West Germany, and Britain and the United States. As everyone knows, the de Gaulle government has long demanded to share the leadership of the Western alliance and atomic secrets in order to join the ranks of atomic powers. The de Gaulle government expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' agreement to mutual visits between Soviet and American leaders, and it also opposed holding a Western summit before the Soviet-American talks because it "did not want Eisenhower to speak for France or Europe." French Prime Minister Debré recently deliberately said: "In order to avoid being harmed by agreements between very large countries, countries like France must have the strength to make others listen to and understand its opinions." In addition, in view of the upcoming United Nations General Assembly and the fact that the Algerian issue will be brought up for discussion again, France is now also eager to ask Western countries to support its policy of aggression against Algeria. According to London's "Reno News", France may even threaten to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on this issue.

    France's attitude has deeply annoyed the United States. The West German "Die Welt" said that the White House "now has the same bad view of General de Gaulle as it did during the war." Britain has openly expressed its disgust with France. Because France has always been a firm opponent of Britain's "free trade zone" plan, and Britain has always been dissatisfied with France's ambition to dominate the West European continent. Recently, many British newspapers launched fierce attacks on France, accusing France's planned nuclear weapons tests as "crimes against humanity" and accusing the ruling groups in Paris and Bonn of trying to continue to "maintain the cold war atmosphere." These attacks by British newspapers were met with sharp retorts from French newspapers. At the same time, French Ambassador to Britain Chauvel also visited the British Foreign Office on August 19, "expressing the French government's regret over some recent articles in British newspapers," because "some of these articles contained insults against General de Gaulle." Agence France-Presse believes that this is an "unusual action, indicating that there is a real crisis in Anglo-French relations."

    West Germany is also worried about the recent easing of the United States' diplomatic policy. The Adenauer group has consistently obstructed the easing of international tensions and opposed a peaceful and reasonable solution to the German question. It fears that the Soviet-American talks may make some progress on the issues of disarmament and banning nuclear weapons tests, thereby affecting the completion of West Germany's atomic expansion plan. The official West German press release said that the West German government believes that "the balance of power between East and West cannot be changed to the detriment of the West. Negotiations must be conducted based on this principle in order to have hope of achieving positive results." West German "Parliamentary Political News" revealed that Adenauer opposed Eisenhower making any detailed talks on the German question in his talks with Khrushchev.

    In the quarrel between Britain and France, Adenauer openly sided with France, trying to squeeze out Britain's position in Western Europe, and was deeply dissatisfied with some of the diplomatic actions taken by the Macmillan government recently. But on the other hand, West Germany is also dissatisfied with the de Gaulle government's ambition to dominate Western Europe. West German newspapers recently wrote: "General de Gaulle's various demands are extremely unpopular."

    In the relations between the United States and Britain, the United States is obviously wary of some of Britain's diplomatic actions since this spring. Because this action has increased Britain's voice in the Western camp and weakened the United States' leadership in the Western alliance. Britain, on the one hand, supported the decision for mutual visits between Soviet and American leaders, but at the same time, it deeply fears that the diplomatic initiative it has already grasped in Western countries will be completely taken over by the United States. Britain has repeatedly stated that the Soviet-American talks cannot replace the summit conference of great powers, and it still demands to hold such a conference.

    In order to mend the cracks between Western countries and prepare for the upcoming Soviet-American talks, the US President began his visit to Western Europe on August 26. During his ten-day visit, in addition to holding talks with Adenauer, Macmillan, and de Gaulle, he will also contact the Italian Prime Minister, the Spanish Foreign Minister, and some senior officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The British "Observer" believes that "nothing like this has ever happened before: a US President personally goes abroad to appease allies and solicit their opinions." The "New York Herald Tribune" wrote: Eisenhower wants to use this trip to "publicly show the unity between the allies," but he "will encounter a series of delicate situations on his journey from Bonn to London, and from London to Paris..."

    Economic Difficulties in Western Countries are Developing

    Within Western countries, economic difficulties have also developed. The basic contradiction of the capitalist system, that is, the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private ownership of the means of production, is being fully exposed with new facts.

    The great strike of 500,000 steelworkers in the United States has entered its eighth week. Although the monopoly bourgeoisie and the US authorities have repeatedly exerted pressure, the striking workers still insist on their demands for higher wages and further unite to defend their right to improve their lives. This strike has spread to twelve major steel companies in the United States, whose output accounts for 88% of the national steel production of the United States. Therefore, the strike has had a significant impact on the entire steel industry and the US economy. According to figures released by the US authorities, the US industrial production index has fallen by two points in July, from 155 in June (with the average from 1947 to 1949 as 100) to 153 in July. Due to this strike, the operating rate of the US steel industry has fallen from 90% in June to 44% in July, and then to 12% in early August. US Secretary of Labor Mitchell admitted that unless the steelworkers' strike is "resolved by the end of September or early October, a very serious shortage of steel may occur." Moreover, coal mines, railways, shipping, and the construction industry, which are closely related to the steel industry, have already been greatly affected.

    In addition to the steelworkers' strike, more than 38,000 workers in the United States' four major copper companies, including "Anaconda", have also stopped working recently, effectively paralyzing the US copper production. Other workers, such as dockworkers, meatpacking workers, and railway transportation workers on the West Coast, are also brewing strikes because they are dissatisfied with their wage income. According to the "Wall Street Journal", the total number of workers who have already gone on strike and are currently in labor negotiations and may go on strike in the United States is estimated at more than 1.7 million.

    The new high tide of the strike movement in the United States, on the one hand, shows that the combativeness and unity of the American working class are increasing day by day, and also shows how illusory the so-called "beautiful" lives of ordinary people in the United States and the "democracy and freedom" of the United States, which have been repeatedly touted by figures of the US ruling group recently, are. The reason why American workers insist on strike struggles despite the threat of cutting off income and enduring hunger is that their dissatisfaction with the current economic situation has reached an intolerable point. According to figures released by the US authorities, US consumer debt reached a record high of 46.7 billion US dollars in June this year. The US cost of living index rose to a record high of 124.9 in July this year (with the average from 1947 to 1949 as 100), and the price of food led the way in rising.

    In Western European countries, the shrinking of industrial production and economic and financial difficulties are also becoming increasingly serious. According to figures recently released by the British authorities, the production levels of important industrial sectors such as steel, coal, railway freight, shipbuilding, industrial construction, and textiles in Britain in the first half of this year were all lower than in the same period last year. Due to the crisis in the textile industry, Lancashire, the center of the British textile industry, has dismantled 45,000 so-called surplus looms. They account for about one-sixth of the total number of looms in Britain. The British coal mining industry is also becoming increasingly depressed. According to James Bowman, Chairman of the British National Coal Board, Britain will close one-third of the coal mines that are currently still being mined in the next six years. It is estimated that 55,000 to more than 100,000 coal miners will lose their jobs as a result. In France, the economic situation has still not fundamentally improved. Due to following the United States in engaging in arms expansion and war preparation and continuing to engage in the colonial war of aggression against Algeria, France's finances are still in serious difficulty. French Finance Minister Pinay recently admitted that in the government's 1960 budget currently being prepared, the fiscal deficit still reaches 600 billion francs, that is, the same as the French government's budget deficit before de Gaulle came to power.

    半月国际述评
    （从8月16日到31日）
    社会主义阵营  日益壮大和团结
    今年上半年社会主义各国国民经济获得巨大的发展。不久前各国发表的生产公报表明，所有社会主义国家的工业发展的速度都很快。
    中共八届八中全会公报指出，我国今年上半年工业总产值同去年同期比较增加了65％；在农业方面，夏季作物的平均单位面积产量都有所提高，小麦、早稻、油菜籽的总产量都比去年的特大丰收有所超过。今年内，在工农业主要产品方面提前完成原定第二个五年计划最后一年（1962年）完成的主要指标是完全可能的。最近，朝鲜劳动党举行了中央常务委员会扩大会议，提出了进一步发展地方工业，建立中央工业和地方工业体系的方针，为将从1961年开始的第二个五年计划重新组织力量。这半月中正逢罗马尼亚解放十五周年。短短的十五年来，罗马尼亚已建设成一个先进的工农业国家了。从1948年到1958年，罗马尼亚的工业总产值增加了三点六倍，平均每年增长速度为16.5％。社会主义各国正在把社会主义竞赛提高到一个新的阶段。苏联劳动人民和许多社会主义国家的劳动人民，正在热烈学习加干诺娃的榜样，帮助落后共同前进。捷克斯洛伐克正展开群众运动，节约投资，加快社会主义建设速度。波兰全国各工矿企业职工正在展开一个讨论下一个五年计划（1961—1965年）的运动，许多工矿企业都在挖掘生产潜力，纷纷提高增产指标。所有上述这些情况，都说明以苏联为首的社会主义各国的力量日益增强。
    同时，社会主义各国之间的团结合作也进一步巩固和发展了。今年上半年，社会主义各国党政领导人频繁的相互访问、举行会谈，以及各种经济、文化等代表团的来往都说明了这一点。越南民主共和国主席胡志明曾到苏联休假，并在回国途中访问了我国；以泽登巴尔为首的蒙古党政代表团正在访问越南；我国全国人民代表大会代表团也正在访问蒙古；另外，我国政府代表团前往苏联和捷克斯洛伐克参观访问。在经济的互助合作方面，最近设计成功的建设贯穿苏联、波兰、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利五国的大输油管总方案，是一个新的范例。
    正如中共八届八中全会公报指出的：以苏联为首的社会主义各国的力量和它们之间的团结合作日益增强。这对于我国实现国民经济的继续跃进是十分有利的。
    艾森豪威尔面临着  微妙的局面
    同社会主义各国之间团结不断加强和社会主义建设事业欣欣向荣的情形相反，帝国主义阵营内部的困难和矛盾最近继续增长。“纽约时报”写道：现在“北大西洋公约组织本身正遭到盟国之间空前未有的吵嘴、竞争和猜疑的冲击”。
    西方国家的明争暗斗，特别表现在法国、西德同英国和美国之间的关系上。大家知道，戴高乐政府早就要求分享西方联盟的领导权和原子秘密，以便跻身于原子大国的行列。戴高乐政府对美国同意苏美首脑相互访问的做法表示不满，它也反对在苏美会谈之前举行西方最高级会议，因为它“不希望艾森豪威尔为法国或者欧洲讲话”。法国总理德勃雷最近故意这样说：“为了避免被很大的国家间的协议所损害，像法国这样的国家必须拥有力量来使别人听取和了解它的意见”。此外，有鉴于联合国大会召开在即，而阿尔及利亚问题又将再一次被提出来讨论，法国现在也急于要求西方各国支持其侵略阿尔及利亚的政策。据伦敦“雷诺新闻”透露，法国在这个问题上甚至可能以退出北大西洋集团相威胁。
    法国的这种态度使美国深为恼火。西德“世界报”说，白宫“现在在谈到戴高乐将军时，对他的看法同大战时一样恶劣”。英国对法国更是公开表示反感。因为法国一直是英国“自由贸易区”计划的坚决反对者，而法国企图称霸西欧大陆的野心也一向为英国所不满。最近英国许多报纸对法国展开了激烈的攻击，指责法国准备试验核武器是“对人类犯罪”，指责巴黎和波恩统治集团力图继续“保持冷战气氛”。英国报纸的这种攻击，遭到了法国报纸的反唇相讥。同时，法国驻英大使萧维尔也在8月19日拜访英国外交部，“表达了法国政府对英国报纸上最近出现的若干文章所感到的遗憾”，因为“其中一些文章对戴高乐将军滥施辱骂”。法新社认为，这是一种“异乎寻常的行动，说明英法关系中存在着真正的危机”。
    西德对于美国最近在外交政策上的和缓姿态也是忧心忡忡。阿登纳集团一贯阻挠国际紧张局势走向缓和，反对德国问题得到和平合理的解决。它害怕苏美会谈在裁军和禁止核武器试验的问题上可能取得某些进展，从而影响西德原子扩军计划的完成。西德的官方新闻公报说，西德政府认为，“东西方的均势不能发生不利于西方的改变，必须从这个原则出发进行谈判，才有取得积极结果的希望”。西德“议会政治新闻”则透露，阿登纳反对艾森豪威尔在同赫鲁晓夫的会谈中就德国问题作任何细节上的会谈。
    在英法两国之间的争吵中，阿登纳公开袒护法国，力图排挤英国在西欧的地位，并且对麦克米伦政府最近一个时期以来在外交上所采取的某些行动深为不满。但在另一方面，西德对戴高乐政府企图以西欧盟主自居的野心也有所不满。西德报纸最近写道：“戴高乐将军的各种要求，是极不受欢迎的”。
    在美英两国的关系中，美国对于英国从今春以来在外交上的一些行动，显然有所顾忌。因为这种行动提高了英国在西方阵营中的发言权，削弱了美国在西方联盟中的领导地位。英国一方面支持苏美首脑互访的决定，但同时又深恐自己在西方国家中已经掌握的外交主动权被美国完全接收过去。英国已一再表明，苏美会谈不能代替大国首脑会议，它仍然要求举行这种会议。
    为了弥补西方国家之间的裂痕，并为即将到来的苏美会谈进行准备，美国总统已于8月26日开始到西欧进行访问。在十天的访问期间，他除了同阿登纳、麦克米伦和戴高乐会谈外，还将同意大利总理、西班牙外长以及北大西洋公约组织的一些高级官员接触。英国“观察家报”认为，“过去从来没有发生过这样的事：一位美国总统亲自出国去抚慰盟国和征询他们的意见。”“纽约先驱论坛报”写道：艾森豪威尔想借此行“公开显示一下盟国之间的团结”，但是他“从波恩到伦敦，再从伦敦到巴黎的旅途上将遇到一系列微妙的局面……”。
    西方国家经济困难在发展中
    在西方国家内部，经济困难也有了发展。资本主义制度的基本矛盾，即生产的社会性和生产资料私有制之间的矛盾，正在以新的事实充分暴露出来。
    美国五十万钢铁工人的大罢工已经进入了第八周。虽然垄断资产阶级和美国官方一再施加压力，但是罢工工人仍然坚持他们提高工资的要求，并进一步团结起来保卫他们争取改善生活的权利。这次罢工遍及美国十二个主要的钢铁公司，它们的产量占美国全国钢铁生产的88％。因此，罢工已对整个钢铁工业和美国经济发生了重大的影响。据美国官方发表的数字，美国工业生产指数已在7月份下降了两点，即从6月份的一五五（以1947年到1949年的平均数为一百）下降到7月份的一五三。由于这次罢工，美国钢铁工业的开工率已从6月份的90％下降到7月份的44％，再降到8月初的12％。美国劳工部长密契尔承认，除非钢铁工人的罢工在“9月底或10月初得到解决，否则可能出现非常严重的缺乏钢铁的情况”。而且，同钢铁工业有密切关系的煤矿、铁路、航运和建筑业现在就已受到了很大的影响。
    除了钢铁工人罢工以外，美国“安那康达”等四家主要铜业公司的三万八千多工人也在最近全部停止工作，使美国的铜业生产实际上陷于瘫痪。其他如西海岸的船坞工人、肉食工人和铁路运输工人等也因为对工资收入不满而正在酝酿罢工。据“华尔街日报”估计，目前美国已经罢工和正在进行劳资谈判可能罢工的工人总数达一百七十多万人。
    美国罢工运动的新高涨，一方面说明美国工人阶级的斗争性和团结正在日益加强，同时也说明美国统治集团人物最近一再吹嘘的所谓美国普通人民生活的“美好”和美国的“民主自由”是多么的虚妄。美国工人所以不顾断绝收入和忍饥挨饿的威胁而坚持罢工斗争，是因为他们对经济生活现状的不满已经到了无可容忍的地步。据美国官方发表的数字，美国消费者的债务在今年6月份已达到了四百六十七亿美元的纪录。美国的生活费用指数在今年7月份已上升到一二四点九（以1947—1949年的平均数为一百）的最高纪录，而带头上涨的就是食品价格。
    在西欧国家，工业生产的萎缩和经济财政困难也正在日益严重起来。据英国官方最近发表的数字，今年上半年英国的钢铁、煤炭、铁路货运、造船、工业建筑和纺织等重要工业部门的生产水平都比去年同期为低。由于纺织工业的危机，英国的纺织工业中心兰开夏已经拆除了四万五千架所谓过剩的织布机。它们占英国全国织布机的六分之一左右。英国的煤矿工业也越来越不景气了。据英国国家煤业局主席詹姆斯·鲍曼说，今后六年内，英国要封闭目前还在开采的煤矿的三分之一。预计有五万五千到十万多煤矿工人将要因此而失业。在法国，经济情况仍然没有根本好转。由于追随美国进行扩军备战和继续从事侵略阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，法国的财政仍然陷于严重的困难之中。法国财政部长比内最近承认，在目前正在编制的政府1960年度预算中，财政赤字仍旧达到六千亿法郎之巨，即跟戴高乐上台前法国政府的预算赤字一样。
