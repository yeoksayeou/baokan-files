Half-Monthly International Review
(From August 16th to 31st)

    The Socialist Camp: Growing Stronger and More United

    The socialist countries achieved tremendous development in their national economies in the first half of this year. Production communiques recently released by various countries show that the industrial development of all socialist countries is very rapid.

    The communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out that China's total industrial output value in the first half of this year increased by 65% compared with the same period last year; in agriculture, the average yield per unit area of summer crops has been improved, and the total output of wheat, early rice, and rapeseed has exceeded last year's exceptionally good harvest. It is entirely possible to complete the main targets of the original Second Five-Year Plan (1962) in terms of major industrial and agricultural products ahead of schedule within this year. Recently, the Central Standing Committee of the Korean Workers' Party held an enlarged meeting, proposing the policy of further developing local industries and establishing a system of central and local industries, in order to reorganize forces for the second Five-Year Plan starting in 1961. This half-month marks the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Romania. In just fifteen years, Romania has been built into an advanced industrial and agricultural country. From 1948 to 1958, Romania's total industrial output value increased by 3.6 times, with an average annual growth rate of 16.5%. Socialist countries are raising the socialist competition to a new stage. The working people of the Soviet Union and many socialist countries are enthusiastically learning from the example of Gaganova to help the backward move forward together. Czechoslovakia is launching a mass movement to save investment and accelerate the speed of socialist construction. Workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises throughout Poland are launching a movement to discuss the next Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), and many industrial and mining enterprises are tapping production potential and increasing production targets. All the above-mentioned situations indicate that the strength of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is increasing day by day.

    At the same time, the unity and cooperation among socialist countries have been further consolidated and developed. The frequent mutual visits and talks between party and government leaders of socialist countries, as well as the exchanges of various economic, cultural and other delegations in the first half of this year, illustrate this point. Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, took a vacation in the Soviet Union and visited China on his way back home; the Mongolian party and government delegation headed by Tsedenbal is visiting Vietnam; the delegation of the National People's Congress of China is also visiting Mongolia; in addition, the Chinese government delegation went to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia for visits and inspections. In terms of economic mutual assistance and cooperation, the recently successfully designed overall plan for the construction of a large oil pipeline running through the five countries of the Soviet Union, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary is a new example.

    As the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out: the strength of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and their unity and cooperation are increasing day by day. This is very beneficial to China's realization of a continued leap forward in the national economy.

    Eisenhower Faces a Delicate Situation

    In contrast to the continuous strengthening of unity among socialist countries and the flourishing socialist construction, the difficulties and contradictions within the imperialist camp have continued to grow recently. "The New York Times" wrote: Now "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization itself is being hit by unprecedented quarrels, competitions, and suspicions among allies."

    The open and covert struggles among Western countries are particularly manifested in the relations between France, West Germany, and Britain and the United States. As everyone knows, the de Gaulle government has long demanded to share the leadership of the Western alliance and atomic secrets in order to join the ranks of atomic powers. The de Gaulle government expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' agreement to mutual visits between Soviet and American leaders, and it also opposed holding a Western summit before the Soviet-American talks because it "did not want Eisenhower to speak for France or Europe." French Prime Minister Debr√© recently deliberately said: "In order to avoid being harmed by agreements between very large countries, countries like France must have the strength to make others listen to and understand its opinions." In addition, in view of the upcoming United Nations General Assembly and the fact that the Algerian issue will be brought up for discussion again, France is now also eager to ask Western countries to support its policy of aggression against Algeria. According to London's "Reno News", France may even threaten to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on this issue.

    France's attitude has deeply annoyed the United States. The West German "Die Welt" said that the White House "now has the same bad view of General de Gaulle as it did during the war." Britain has openly expressed its disgust with France. Because France has always been a firm opponent of Britain's "free trade zone" plan, and Britain has always been dissatisfied with France's ambition to dominate the West European continent. Recently, many British newspapers launched fierce attacks on France, accusing France's planned nuclear weapons tests as "crimes against humanity" and accusing the ruling groups in Paris and Bonn of trying to continue to "maintain the cold war atmosphere." These attacks by British newspapers were met with sharp retorts from French newspapers. At the same time, French Ambassador to Britain Chauvel also visited the British Foreign Office on August 19, "expressing the French government's regret over some recent articles in British newspapers," because "some of these articles contained insults against General de Gaulle." Agence France-Presse believes that this is an "unusual action, indicating that there is a real crisis in Anglo-French relations."

    West Germany is also worried about the recent easing of the United States' diplomatic policy. The Adenauer group has consistently obstructed the easing of international tensions and opposed a peaceful and reasonable solution to the German question. It fears that the Soviet-American talks may make some progress on the issues of disarmament and banning nuclear weapons tests, thereby affecting the completion of West Germany's atomic expansion plan. The official West German press release said that the West German government believes that "the balance of power between East and West cannot be changed to the detriment of the West. Negotiations must be conducted based on this principle in order to have hope of achieving positive results." West German "Parliamentary Political News" revealed that Adenauer opposed Eisenhower making any detailed talks on the German question in his talks with Khrushchev.

    In the quarrel between Britain and France, Adenauer openly sided with France, trying to squeeze out Britain's position in Western Europe, and was deeply dissatisfied with some of the diplomatic actions taken by the Macmillan government recently. But on the other hand, West Germany is also dissatisfied with the de Gaulle government's ambition to dominate Western Europe. West German newspapers recently wrote: "General de Gaulle's various demands are extremely unpopular."

    In the relations between the United States and Britain, the United States is obviously wary of some of Britain's diplomatic actions since this spring. Because this action has increased Britain's voice in the Western camp and weakened the United States' leadership in the Western alliance. Britain, on the one hand, supported the decision for mutual visits between Soviet and American leaders, but at the same time, it deeply fears that the diplomatic initiative it has already grasped in Western countries will be completely taken over by the United States. Britain has repeatedly stated that the Soviet-American talks cannot replace the summit conference of great powers, and it still demands to hold such a conference.

    In order to mend the cracks between Western countries and prepare for the upcoming Soviet-American talks, the US President began his visit to Western Europe on August 26. During his ten-day visit, in addition to holding talks with Adenauer, Macmillan, and de Gaulle, he will also contact the Italian Prime Minister, the Spanish Foreign Minister, and some senior officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The British "Observer" believes that "nothing like this has ever happened before: a US President personally goes abroad to appease allies and solicit their opinions." The "New York Herald Tribune" wrote: Eisenhower wants to use this trip to "publicly show the unity between the allies," but he "will encounter a series of delicate situations on his journey from Bonn to London, and from London to Paris..."

    Economic Difficulties in Western Countries are Developing

    Within Western countries, economic difficulties have also developed. The basic contradiction of the capitalist system, that is, the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private ownership of the means of production, is being fully exposed with new facts.

    The great strike of 500,000 steelworkers in the United States has entered its eighth week. Although the monopoly bourgeoisie and the US authorities have repeatedly exerted pressure, the striking workers still insist on their demands for higher wages and further unite to defend their right to improve their lives. This strike has spread to twelve major steel companies in the United States, whose output accounts for 88% of the national steel production of the United States. Therefore, the strike has had a significant impact on the entire steel industry and the US economy. According to figures released by the US authorities, the US industrial production index has fallen by two points in July, from 155 in June (with the average from 1947 to 1949 as 100) to 153 in July. Due to this strike, the operating rate of the US steel industry has fallen from 90% in June to 44% in July, and then to 12% in early August. US Secretary of Labor Mitchell admitted that unless the steelworkers' strike is "resolved by the end of September or early October, a very serious shortage of steel may occur." Moreover, coal mines, railways, shipping, and the construction industry, which are closely related to the steel industry, have already been greatly affected.

    In addition to the steelworkers' strike, more than 38,000 workers in the United States' four major copper companies, including "Anaconda", have also stopped working recently, effectively paralyzing the US copper production. Other workers, such as dockworkers, meatpacking workers, and railway transportation workers on the West Coast, are also brewing strikes because they are dissatisfied with their wage income. According to the "Wall Street Journal", the total number of workers who have already gone on strike and are currently in labor negotiations and may go on strike in the United States is estimated at more than 1.7 million.

    The new high tide of the strike movement in the United States, on the one hand, shows that the combativeness and unity of the American working class are increasing day by day, and also shows how illusory the so-called "beautiful" lives of ordinary people in the United States and the "democracy and freedom" of the United States, which have been repeatedly touted by figures of the US ruling group recently, are. The reason why American workers insist on strike struggles despite the threat of cutting off income and enduring hunger is that their dissatisfaction with the current economic situation has reached an intolerable point. According to figures released by the US authorities, US consumer debt reached a record high of 46.7 billion US dollars in June this year. The US cost of living index rose to a record high of 124.9 in July this year (with the average from 1947 to 1949 as 100), and the price of food led the way in rising.

    In Western European countries, the shrinking of industrial production and economic and financial difficulties are also becoming increasingly serious. According to figures recently released by the British authorities, the production levels of important industrial sectors such as steel, coal, railway freight, shipbuilding, industrial construction, and textiles in Britain in the first half of this year were all lower than in the same period last year. Due to the crisis in the textile industry, Lancashire, the center of the British textile industry, has dismantled 45,000 so-called surplus looms. They account for about one-sixth of the total number of looms in Britain. The British coal mining industry is also becoming increasingly depressed. According to James Bowman, Chairman of the British National Coal Board, Britain will close one-third of the coal mines that are currently still being mined in the next six years. It is estimated that 55,000 to more than 100,000 coal miners will lose their jobs as a result. In France, the economic situation has still not fundamentally improved. Due to following the United States in engaging in arms expansion and war preparation and continuing to engage in the colonial war of aggression against Algeria, France's finances are still in serious difficulty. French Finance Minister Pinay recently admitted that in the government's 1960 budget currently being prepared, the fiscal deficit still reaches 600 billion francs, that is, the same as the French government's budget deficit before de Gaulle came to power.
