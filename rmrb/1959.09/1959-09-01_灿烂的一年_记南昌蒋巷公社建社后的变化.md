A Brilliant Year
    —Remembering the Changes in Nanchang Jiangxiang Commune After its Establishment
        By Our Reporter Liu Guanghui
    The people's commune has been established for a full year, from September last year to September this year. What changes have taken place in rural production and the material and cultural lives of farmers during this year? To answer these questions, we recently conducted a preliminary survey in Jiangxiang People's Commune, Nanchang County, Jiangxi. The facts of this commune prove that after communization, agricultural production and diversified economy have achieved leapfrog development, and the material and cultural lives of farmers have been significantly improved. Such a rate of development has never been seen before, let alone imagined, before communization.
    Unprecedented Bumper Harvest
    What about the yields of early rice and oil crops this year? The answer is: an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total output of 100,210 mu of early rice sown by the whole commune increased by 25.3% compared with last year, and the yield per mu increased by 23%. In the past, very few oil crops were planted here. Last year, the whole commune was supplied with more than 84,700 jin of edible oil by the state. This year, more than 160,000 mu of rapeseed were sown. In addition to seed retention and completion of the state transfer task, there are still 471,500 jin of oil for self-sufficiency, with 2.3 liang of oil per person.
    The commune members said: "This year's bumper harvest of grain and oil crops was brought about by the people's commune." This is indeed the case. The people's commune is large in scale, has a large labor force, and has strong material resources. Therefore, this year it can achieve intensive cultivation, eliminate disasters, and achieve unprecedented harvests. Now, the following three aspects are cited as examples to prove this problem: First, agricultural infrastructure construction such as water conservancy, fertilizers, and tools; second, implementation of the policy of diversified high-yield and multi-harvest; and third, land leveling.
    Jiangxiang Commune is a lakeside area bordering Nanchang City in the west and Poyang Lake in the east, consisting of three large dikes, namely Ma Hong, Sanji, and Yicheng, and more than ten small dikes. Before liberation, due to the disrepair of the dikes, they often collapsed, and more than 50,000 mu of paddy fields did not yield crops for two out of three years. Especially the more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields near Poyang Lake, the terrain is low-lying. Three days of heavy rain and flooding of Poyang Lake would cause waterlogging; ten days without rain and the water level of Poyang Lake would drop, causing drought. Often, no rice grains were harvested at the end of the year. To eliminate the threat of drought and flood in this area, it is necessary to build three long drainage ditches and a batch of ponds, a huge project spanning dozens of miles. After liberation, during the period of mutual aid groups and agricultural cooperatives, the dikes were heightened and reinforced, and some small ponds were built; however, the serious threat of drought and flood to tens of thousands of mu of land could not be fundamentally eliminated. Luo Shishu, a 60-year-old commune member, said: "Our family of three generations has wanted to repair the drainage ditch. After liberation, I proposed it in the mutual aid group, but it didn't work; I proposed it in the elementary agricultural cooperative, but it didn't work; I proposed it again in the advanced cooperative, but it still didn't work!" The old commune member clapped his hands and then said: "At that time, the advanced cooperative only had more than 300 laborers. To plant more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields, not only could it not spare a large number of people to repair the drainage ditch, but also the funds were insufficient." However, the wish of Luo Shishu's three generations came true in the first winter after the establishment of the commune. Last winter, the commune unified planning and arrangement for the production of the entire commune, mobilized more than 12,000 people to build drainage ditches. With the strength of many people, they worked happily. After 40 days of fighting, the three drainage ditches, 30 li long, 40 feet wide, and 30 feet deep, were all completed, and 125 ponds were built. The 40,000 mu of paddy fields threatened by waterlogging and drought were changed from planting one season of medium rice in the past to planting double-cropping rice. Although the early rice encountered a special flood, the drainage ditch played a role, eliminating the waterlogging disaster, and the yield of early rice per mu reached more than 600 jin. Commune cadres said: "This is the powerful power of the commune." In addition, the commune has also established more than 500 small fertilizer plants, pesticide plants, and farm tool repair plants this year, and added 37 water pumps, 152 iron ox carts, and more than 500 sets of larger advanced production tools such as threshers, transplanters, and hand carts. All these basic constructions have created favorable conditions for the development of agricultural production.
    The bumper harvest of grain and oil crops in Jiangxiang Commune is mainly due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of diversified high-yield and multi-harvest. Last winter, there was a lot of steel production and water conservancy construction, and the production tasks were very heavy; however, because the commune had a large labor force and unified arrangements were properly made, while completing the steel production tasks, it timely sowed 160,000 mu of rapeseed, expanding the planting area by one time compared with the previous winter. After harvesting the rapeseed in the spring, 100,200 mu of early rice were sown, and the lake fields and Zhou fields on the lake shore, which had rarely been planted with crops in the past, were planted with early rice, expanding by 2,000 mu compared with last year. The total output was 1 million jin, accounting for one-fifth of the total increase in early rice production this year.
    Although this is a plain area, the land distribution is not conducive to production. One is that there are many "tofu fields," and the plains on the lake shore are all two or three mu per plot, like tofu blocks, which are inconvenient for cultivation. One is that there are many "interspersed fields," the fields of this team are in the area of that team, and the fields of that team are in the area of this team, which is inconvenient for production and management. The advanced cooperative tried to solve these problems, but due to various obstacles, it did not succeed. After communization, according to the characteristics of "large and public" of the commune, and according to the principle of "unified leadership, classified management, and classified accounting," the commune merged the more than 20,000 mu of "tofu fields" on the lake shore into large plots of 50 mu and 100 mu, fundamentally changing the situation that was not suitable for mechanized farming and inconvenient operation. After that, the commune made reasonable adjustments to more than 15,000 mu of "interspersed fields" in the whole commune, which facilitated cultivation management. In addition, for the more than 4,000 mu of paddy fields in remote areas, the commune also unified arranged a group of laborers to form remote farming teams to settle down and cultivate beside the remote fields. In the past, these remote fields could only harvest one or two hundred jin of grain per mu, but this year the average yield per mu exceeded 300 jin.
    All Industries are Thriving
    In the one year since the establishment of Jiangxiang Commune, not only has it achieved a bumper harvest of early rice and rapeseed, but forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries have also achieved leapfrog development, showing a thriving scene in all industries.
    Jiangxiang Commune's diversified operations are divided into four categories: animal husbandry, fishery, sideline, and industry. It also operates some forestry, with about 1,500 production projects. In fishery, there are currently 2.54 million fish in rivers, ponds, and reservoirs. In the first half of the year, 577,000 jin of fish have been produced, accounting for more than 70% of the total output last year. In sideline industry, there are currently more than 18,800 pigs raised in the whole commune, with an average of 1.4 pigs per household; 200,000 chickens and ducks are raised, with an average of about 15 per household; 2,600 mu of vegetables are planted, and the daily output is 18,000 jin in addition to their own consumption, which is supplied to Nanchang City. In animal husbandry, 6,100 head of cattle are raised, an increase of 2,000 head compared with last year; the number of sheep and rabbits has increased several times compared with last year. In commune-run industry, thousands of various factories, large and small, such as fertilizers, pesticides, farm tools, bricks and tiles, rice milling, and oil pressing, have been established. The total output value of the above-mentioned production undertakings has increased by about four times compared with before communization. The commune accountant said: "The income from industry and sideline industry in one month is enough for the whole commune to pay two months' wages."
    Developing production according to national plans and needs is the first principle of Jiangxiang Commune in carrying out diversified operations. Among the 1,500 production projects operated by the whole commune, none is inconsistent with the national plan. For example, the state market needs vegetables, so the commune established four vegetable production bases in the four management districts of Jiangxiang, Hebian, and Huangdu, which are convenient for transportation, and planted more than 2,000 mu of vegetables, producing more than 10,000 jin of vegetables every day to supply the needs of the state market. Commune members in Huangdu Management District said: "Only the commune can make such production arrangements." Another principle for Jiangxiang Commune to develop diversified operations is to serve the agricultural production of the commune and the lives of the commune members. According to the total output value, 91% of the industrial and sideline industries operated by the whole commune serve the agricultural production of the commune and the lives of the commune members, and less than 10% is commodity production. Fertilizer plants and chemical fertilizer plants have produced 500,000 jin of indigenous pesticides and 10 million jin of indigenous chemical fertilizers, with an average of 5 jin of pesticides and 100 jin of indigenous chemical fertilizers per mu of land in the whole commune. After the completion of the farm tool factory, the repair of medium and small farm tools in the commune has not left the commune, and it has also produced tens of thousands of production tools such as hoes, rakes, plows, and knives. These have strongly supported the development of agricultural production. Jiangxiang Commune is a large commune with more than 13,600 households and more than 64,000 people. Grain processing and non-staple food supply are major matters. The commune paid attention to this matter as soon as it was established, and established rice milling factories, non-staple food processing factories, etc., and properly solved the problems of grain processing and non-staple food supply. This not only satisfied the living needs of the commune members, but also greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of the commune members.
    The main reason for the leapfrog development of diversified economy in Jiangxiang Commune is that it has brought into play the various superior conditions of the people's commune. During the period of advanced cooperatives, although sideline production here was also constantly developing, due to the limitations of labor force and means of production, it could not be developed comprehensively and massively. After the establishment of the commune in September last year, under the premise of ensuring the completion of agricultural production tasks, the commune extracted 20% of the labor force and allocated them to the battle lines of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline fishery and industrial production; and according to the principle of "large-scale farming in slack seasons, small-scale farming in busy seasons, and no farming in busy seasons," labor was reasonably allocated to maintain a balanced development of various production. From November last year to February this year, there was less farm work, and the commune uniformly transferred more than 20,000 people to form specialized teams to run industries at home, catch fresh fish underwater, and collect "treasures" in the mountains. Various types of diversified operations were carried out. After February, when spring farming production was busy, the specialized teams were reduced to 2,000 people. During the busy period of summer harvest and summer planting, except for a few production projects that could not be stopped, industrial production was almost completely stopped, and efforts were concentrated on doing a good job in summer harvest and summer planting.
    During the period of advanced cooperatives, some auxiliary labor force and the strength of elderly commune members were difficult to play due to the limitations of conditions for large-scale diversified operations. After the establishment of the commune, there were many diversified economic projects operated, and some production could be carried out by semi-labor force, the elderly, and children, which brought into play their role in production. Last winter, the commune organized more than 1,200 women, elderly people, and children to weave ropes with rice straw and lake grass, and they received an income of 160,000 yuan in one winter, with an average income of more than 130 yuan per person. The commune not only fully utilized the labor potential, but also further improved labor productivity. For example, in the past, during the advanced cooperative period, because of the limitation of manpower, only small nets could be used to catch fish on the edge of Poyang Lake, and the maximum catch was 600 jin of fish; after communization, a specialized team was established, and the small nets were changed to large nets, which could expedition to the center of Poyang Lake to catch fish, and one net could catch 10,000 to 20,000 jin, while the labor force only increased by one or two times compared with using small nets. For example, most of the commune members of Beiwang Brigade (formerly advanced cooperative) could catch fish, but during the agricultural cooperative period, because of the shortage of labor and the need to cultivate land, many people had to give up fishing. The commune members of Lefeng Brigade (formerly advanced cooperative) near this team could not catch fish, they could only cultivate land, but there was less land and more people, and the labor force was not fully utilized. After communization, the commune assigned the paddy fields of Beiwang Brigade to Lefeng Brigade for cultivation, and extracted more than 100 commune members with fishing skills from Beiwang Brigade to form a specialized team for year-round fishing. As a result, the fishing skills of the commune members of Beiwang Brigade were brought into play, and the fishery was developed; the labor force of Lefeng Brigade also fully played its role, and agriculture was developed.
    In developing diversified economy, Jiangxiang Commune, according to the characteristics of the commune, implemented the policy of "walking on two legs" by combining collective operation and commune members' family operation, which played a major role in accelerating the development of diversified economy. Production with more complex technology or larger scale, such as indigenous chemical fertilizers, pesticides, farm tool repair and matching, and fishing, is collectively operated by the commune, management district, and production team; weaving grass ropes, making straw sandals, raising chickens, raising ducks, etc., which are suitable for family operation, are mobilized by commune members to do privately; production such as vegetable planting and pig raising is suitable for both collective operation and commune members' family operation, so both parties do it. There are two major advantages to this approach: one is that it further mobilizes the production enthusiasm of the commune members, making production develop faster; and the other is that it increases the income of the commune members. For example, raising chickens and ducks, last year the whole commune (during the advanced cooperative period) raised about 100,000 chickens and ducks. This year, the commune mobilized the commune members to raise them, and in one year, it developed to 200,000, of which 170,000 were raised by commune members' families, with an average of more than 10 per household.
    Significant Rise in Living Standards
    "After the establishment of the people's commune, the lives of our commune members have risen step by step like going upstairs," said Gong Tangshui, the first secretary of the commune party committee.
    "After the establishment of the people's commune, the number of households with overdrafts in our commune has fallen steadily like a thermometer after autumn," said Wu Jinhe, the director of the commune.
    The income of commune members is a basic measure of their production changes. Let's first look at the income situation. Last year was the year with the most income since liberation here. After deducting various expenses from the total income of agriculture and sideline industry of the whole commune, the actual distribution to the commune members was 3,043,819 yuan, with an average of 46 yuan and 8 jiao per person; the total income of agriculture and sideline industry in the first half of this year, after deducting various expenses, the actual distribution to the commune members was 2,600,4816 yuan, and the average income per person is nearly equal to the income of the whole year last year. Let's look at the changes in living standards from the income situation of the commune members of an ordinary production brigade - Gaowu Production Brigade. This brigade has historically been short of grain, and last year it relied on the state to supply 152,000 jin of grain. This year, the output of early rice alone reached 1,150,000 jin (this brigade mainly planted late rice in the past, and the area of early rice was small), accounting for 87% of the total grain output of the whole year last year. In addition to completing the requisition task and retaining enough grain for six months, it also stored 150,000 jin of grain. The sideline income is also very considerable. The sideline income in the first half of this year reached 23,000 yuan, which is 2,000 yuan more than the sideline income of the whole year last year. Of the 523 households in the whole team, only 56 households made money last year. As a result of the summer harvest distribution in the first half of this year, the number of households making money soared to 423. Female commune member Tu Genxiang's family of nine has only two laborers. In the past, they participated in production every year, but they never made a few cash every year; this year, during the summer harvest distribution, in addition to distributing grain for six months, they also distributed 110 yuan in cash. She was so happy that she said to everyone she met: "The people's commune is infinitely good, and the Communist Party's kindness is as deep as the sea."
    The reduction of "overdraft households" is a sign of the general improvement of farmers' lives. At the time of the establishment of the commune, there were 5,322 "overdraft households" in the whole commune, accounting for 38.8% of the total number of households in the whole commune. These households spent more grain and cash to the commune because of large population, small labor force, or due to illness, marriage, or funeral, and they were deducted from their labor remuneration in the second year to return. After communization, due to the rapid development of production and the superiority of the commune's distribution system, the income of commune members increased. In one year, the number of "overdraft households" has dropped to 813, accounting for only 5.9% of the total number of households, and this number is still decreasing.
    The rise and fall of social purchasing power is another important yardstick for measuring the changes in farmers' lives. In the past, only one or twenty small merchants and peddlers came to buy and sell things. Now, 360 commercial distribution stores have been established. Each production team has a store, and all kinds of means of production and daily necessities are available. In the first half of this year, the total turnover of various stores in the commune reached 1,068,700 yuan, an increase of 48.8% compared with the same period last year. In terms of daily necessities, the sales volume of some high-end commodities that were sold less in the past, such as sweaters, flannel shirts, printed bed sheets, sneakers, gold pens, and bamboo shell thermos bottles, has increased sharply this year. In the Sandong Management District, with 1,341 households and 6,115 people, the whole team added a total of 100 sweaters, 1,420 corduroy shirts, 795 pairs of sneakers, more than 3,000 pieces of poplin and spun silk clothes, and more than 900 bamboo shell thermos bottles. Commune member Liu Ganzi worked as a long-term worker before liberation. He covered a quilt for 31 winters and never had a mosquito net; during the summer harvest distribution in the first half of this year, he distributed more than 100 yuan in cash and bought a new printed quilt and a new hemp mosquito net. Liu Ganzi was so happy that he praised the commune over and over again.
    After communization, the material lives of farmers have greatly improved. What about cultural life?
    After the establishment of Jiangxiang Commune, a regular ordinary middle school, a half-day agricultural middle school, 36 regular ordinary primary schools, and 88 night schools and Red and Expert schools were established. 738 young people and children have enrolled, and all school-age children have been enrolled. Before liberation, there was only one primary school here, and less than 100 children were enrolled, and most of them were children of landlords and rich peasants. After communization, not only has the education cause greatly developed, but the cultural and entertainment lives of commune members have also become increasingly rich and colorful. The whole commune has a cultural center, a library, and 18 cultural stations, which are equipped with various newspapers, magazines, and popular books for commune members to read. There are also 55 amateur theater troupes. Whenever there are festivals and holidays, commune members can watch performances by their own theater troupes. In addition, there is also a radio station, which is equipped with 325 loudspeakers. Every team has a loudspeaker. Every day after work, commune members gather in groups of three or five around the loudspeakers to listen to news broadcasts and moving opera music.
    In the past, there were no hospitals or clinics here. Farmers had to run to Nanchang City, which was one or two li away, to see a doctor and buy medicine. The situation is very different after communization. The commune has established five hospitals and eight health rooms in various management districts, and 40 medical stations and 33 maternity stations in various production teams. There are 48 doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, more than 100 nurses, midwives, and non-separated health workers and midwives working in these medical institutions. Commune members can get treatment without leaving the village if they have a cold, headache, or fever; they don't have to run to Nanchang City to find a hospital if they have a more serious illness. Commune members only pay the cost of medicine for seeing a doctor, and only pay for food according to the supply standard for hospitalization, and the commune bears all the consultation fees. Therefore, commune members praised the commune's hospitals.

    灿烂的一年
    ——记南昌蒋巷公社建社后的变化
        本报记者　刘光辉
    从去年9月到今年9月，人民公社建立已整整一年了。在这一年间，农村的生产、农民的物质和文化生活究竟发生了一些什么变化？为了解答这些问题，我们最近在江西南昌县蒋巷人民公社作了一次初步的调查。这个公社的事实证明：公社化以后，农业生产和多种经济，都获得了飞跃的发展，农民的物质和文化生活都有了显著的提高。这样的发展速度，在公社化以前不但从来没有过，就是想也不敢想。
    亘古未有的大丰收
    今年早稻、油料产量如何呢？回答是：空前大丰收。全社播种的十万零二千一百亩早稻，总产量比去年增长了25.3％，亩产量增长了23％。这里过去很少种植油料作物，去年全社还由国家供应了八万四千七百多斤食油。今年播种了十六万多亩油菜，除留种、完成上调任务外，尚有自给油料四十七万一千五百多斤，每人有油二斤三两。
    社员们说：“今年粮食、油料大丰收是人民公社带来的。”事实的确是这样。人民公社规模大，人力多，物力雄厚，因而今年能够做到精耕细作、消灭灾害，取得空前的丰收。现在从下列三个方面举出事例来证实这个问题：一是水利、肥料和工具等农业基本建设；二是贯彻多种高产多收的方针；三是平整土地。
    蒋巷公社是一个西临南昌市、东接鄱阳湖的一个滨湖地区，由马红、三集、义成等三个大圩和十多个小圩组成。解放前，由于圩堤年久失修，经常倒塌，有五万多亩稻田三年两不收。尤其是其中靠近鄱阳湖的四万多亩稻田，地势低洼，三天大雨，鄱阳湖发洪水，就成涝灾；十天不下雨，鄱阳湖水势下降，就成旱灾，往往年终收不到禾谷种。要解除这个地区的旱涝威胁，需要修建三条长大的排水沟和一批水塘，工程巨大，横直数十里。解放后，互助组、农业社期间，对圩堤进行了加高加固，修建了一些小水塘；但是，不能从根本上解除上万亩田的严重旱涝威胁。六十多岁的社员罗时述说：“我们想修排水沟想了我家祖孙三代。
  解放后，我在互助组提了不行；在初级农业社提，不行；到高级社我又提，还是不行啊！”这位老社员两手一拍，接着说：“高级社当时只有三百多劳动力，要种植一千多亩稻田，不仅抽不出大批人力来修排水沟，而且资金也不足。”可是，公社成立后的第一个冬天，罗时述祖孙三代的愿望就实现了。去冬，公社统一筹划和安排全社的生产，调动了一万二千多人修建排水沟。人多势众力量大，干的欢，经过四十天战斗，全长三十华里、宽四十尺、深三十尺的三条排水沟就全部建成了，并修建了一百二十五个水塘。四万亩受涝、旱威胁的稻田由过去种一季中稻，改种了双季稻。早稻虽然遇到了特大的洪水，但是排水沟发挥了作用，消灭了涝灾，早稻亩产达六百斤以上。公社干部说：“这就是公社的强大威力。”此外，公社今年还建立了五百多个小型的肥料厂、农药厂和农具修造厂，添置了三十七个抽水机、一百五十二部铁牛车和五百多件打谷机、插秧机、手推车等较大型的先进生产工具。所有这些基本建设都为发展农业生产创造了有利的条件。
    蒋巷公社粮食、油料大丰收，主要是由于认真贯彻了多种高产多收的方针。去年冬天大搞钢铁，兴修水利，生产任务十分繁重；但是，由于公社劳力多，统一安排得当，因此在完成钢铁生产任务的同时，及时播种了十六万亩油菜，比前冬扩种了一倍。在春天收完油菜后，接着播种了十万零二千亩早稻，把过去很少种植过农作物的湖滨的湖田、洲田都种上了早稻，比去年扩大了二千亩。总产量一百万斤，占今年早稻增产总数的五分之一。
    这里虽属平原，土地分布却不利于生产。一是“豆腐田”多，湖滨平原上都是两亩三亩一丘，像豆腐块一样，耕作不方便。一是“插花地”多，这个队的田在那个队的地区，那个队的田在这个队的地区，生产、管理都不便利。高级社时曾试图解决这些问题，由于种种原因阻碍，都未成功。公社化后，根据公社“一大二公”的特点，按照“统一领导、分级管理、分级核算”的原则，公社将湖滨的二万多亩
  “豆腐田”并成了五十亩一百亩的大丘，从根本上改变了不适宜机耕和操作不便的情况。之后，公社对全社一万五千多亩“插花地”进行了合理调整，便利了耕作管理。此外，对边远地区的四千多亩稻田，公社还统一安排了一批劳力分别组成远耕队，到边远田旁安家耕作。过去，这些远田每亩只能收到一两百斤谷，今年平均亩产都超过了三百斤。
      百业兴旺
    蒋巷公社建立一年间，不仅取得了早稻、油菜大丰收，林牧副等业也获得了飞跃发展，呈现了百业兴旺的景象。
    蒋巷公社多种经营分牧业、渔业、副业和工业四大类，也经营一些林业，生产项目约达一千五百项。渔业，现在河塘、河库里养有二百五十四万尾鱼，上半年已产鱼五十七万七千斤，占去年总产量的70％多。副业，目前全社养猪一万八千八百多头，平均每户养猪一点四头；养鸡鸭二十万只，平均每户约十五只；种植了二千六百亩蔬菜，每天的产量除自己吃以外，还有一万八千斤供应南昌市。牧业，饲养耕牛六千一百头，比去年增加了二千头；羊、兔的数量比去年都有成倍的增多。社办工业，兴办了肥料、农药、农具、砖瓦、碾米、榨油等各种大小工厂上千个。上述生产事业的总产值比公社化前增加了四倍左右。公社会计说：“一个月的工业、副业的收入，就够全社发两个月的工资。”
    根据国家计划和需要发展生产，是蒋巷公社开展多种经营的第一条原则。全社经营了一千五百来个生产项目，没有一项是与国家计划不协调的。例如，国家市场上需要蔬菜，公社就在运输方便的蒋巷、河边、黄渡等四个管理区建立了四个蔬菜生产基地，播种了二千多亩蔬菜，每天生产一万多斤蔬菜供应国家市场需要。黄渡管理区社员说：“这样的安排生产，只有公社才能做得到。”蒋巷公社发展多种经营的另一个原则是，为本社农业生产服务，为社员生活服务。按总产值计算，全社经营的工业、副业为本社农业生产和社员生活服务的占91％，商品性的生产不到10％。农药厂、化肥厂至今已生产了土农药五十万斤，土化肥一千万斤，全社平均每亩田有五斤农药、一百斤土化肥。农具厂建成后，公社的中小型农具修理没有出过社，还生产了上万件锄、耙、犁、刀等生产工具。这些，有力地支援了农业生产的发展。蒋巷公社是个大社，一万三千六百多户，六万四千多人，粮米加工和副食品供应是件大事情；公社一建立就注意了这件事，办了碾米厂、副食品加工厂等，妥善地解决了粮米加工和副食品供应问题。这样做，不仅满足了社员的生活需要，并大大激发了社员的生产积极性。
    蒋巷公社多种经济飞跃发展，主要原因在于：发挥了人民公社具有的各种优越条件。在高级社时期，这里的副业生产虽然也不断地发展，由于劳动力和生产资料的限制，还不能全面地、大量地发展。去年9月成立公社后，在保证完成农业生产任务的前提下，全社抽出20％的劳力，分配到林牧副渔和工业生产战线上；并根据“农闲大搞、小忙小搞、大忙不搞”的原则，合理调配劳力，以保持各项生产平衡发展。去年11月到今年2月，农活少，公社就统一抽调了两万多人组成专业队，在家办工业，下水捕鲜鱼，上山取“财宝”，各种项目的多种经营都开展起来。2月以后，春耕生产忙，专业队减到两千人。夏收夏种大忙时期，除少数生产项目不能停工以外，工业几乎全部停止了生产，集中力量搞好夏收夏种。
    高级社时期由于条件限制不能大搞多种经营，一些附带劳动力和老年社员的力量就难以发挥出来。公社成立以后，经营的多种经济项目很多，有些生产半劳力、老年、小孩都可以搞，这就发挥了他们在生产上的作用。去年冬天公社组织了一千二百多个妇女、老年、小孩利用稻草、湖草织绳索，一个冬天就得到了十六万元的收入，平均每人收入一百三十多元。公社不但充分发挥了劳动潜力，还进一步提高了劳动生产效率。如过去高级社时，因为人力限制，只能用小网在鄱阳湖边捕鱼，一网最多捕六百斤鱼；公社化后成立了专业队，把小网改成大网，可以远征到鄱阳湖中心捕鱼，一网就能捕到一、两万斤，而劳力只比用小网时增加一、两倍。又如，北望大队（原高级社）大部分社员会捕鱼，可是在农业社期间，因为劳力少，又要种田，许多人只得放弃了捕鱼。这个队附近的乐丰大队（原高级社）社员不会捕鱼，只会种田，可是田少人多，劳力没有充分利用起来。公社化后，公社把北望大队的稻田划给乐丰大队耕作，在北望大队抽调了一百多个具有捕鱼技术的社员，组成一支专业队，常年捕鱼。结果，北望大队社员捕鱼技术得到了发挥，发展了渔业；乐丰大队劳力也充分发挥了作用，发展了农业。
    在发展多种经济时，蒋巷公社根据公社特点贯彻了集体经营与社员家庭经营相结合的“两条腿走路”的方针，对加速发展多种经济起了重大作用。土化肥、农药、农具修配、捕鱼等技术较复杂或规模较大的生产，就由公社、管理区、生产队集体经营；织草绳、打草鞋、养鸡、养鸭等适合家庭经营，就发动社员私人搞；种菜、养猪等生产，既适合集体经营，又适合社员家庭经营，就双方都搞。这种做法，最大的好处有两个，一是更进一步地调动了社员的生产积极性，使生产更快地向前发展；二是增多了社员的收入。如养鸡、养鸭，去年全社（高级社期间）养鸡鸭十万只左右，今年公社发动社员饲养，一年时间就发展到二十万只，其中社员家庭饲养的占十七万只，平均每户有十多只。
    生活显著上升
    “人民公社成立后，我们社员的生活，就像上楼梯一样步步上升。”公社党委第一书记公唐水这样说。
    “人民公社成立后，我们社里的超支户，就像秋后的寒暑表一样节节下降。”公社主任吴锦河这样说。
    社员收入多少，是衡量他们生产变化的一个基本尺度。我们就先看看收入情况吧。去年是这里解放后收入最多的一年，全社农副业总收入中除开各项开支后，实际分配给社员的为三百零四万三千八百一十九元，每人平均四十六元八角；今年上半年的农副业总收入除开各项开支外，实际分配给社员的有二百六十万零四千八百一十六元，每人平均收入将近等于去年全年的收入。我们再从一个普通的生产大队——高悟生产大队社员的收入情况来看生活的变化。这个大队历史上一贯缺粮，去年还靠国家供应了十五万二千斤粮食。今年早稻一季产量就达一百一十五万斤（这个大队过去主要是种晚稻，早稻面积少），占去年全年粮食总产量的87％，除完成征购任务和留足了六个月口粮外，还储备了十五万斤粮食。副业收入也非常可观。今年上半年的副业收入就达二万三千元，比去年全年副业收入还多二千元。全队五百二十三户，去年进钱户只有五十六户，今年上半年夏收分配结果，进钱户跃增到四百二十三户。女社员涂根香一家九口人，只有两个劳动力，过去年年参加生产，年年没有进到几个现钱；今年夏收分配，除分到六个月的口粮外，还分到一百一十元现金。她高兴得逢人便说：“人民公社无限好，共产党的恩情海样深。”
    “超支户”减少，是农民生活普遍提高的一个标志。公社成立时，全社有“超支户”五千三百二十二户，占全社总户数的38.8％。这些户因为人口多、劳动力少，或者是由于生病、嫁娶、办丧事等，向社里多支了一些粮食、现金，等到第二年再从自己劳动报酬中扣除归还。公社化后，由于生产的飞速发展和公社分配制度的优越，增加了社员的收入，一年间“超支户”就已下降到八百一十三户，仅占总户数的5.9％，并且这个数字还在下降。
    社会购买力的升降，是衡量农民生活变化的又一个重要标尺。这里过去只一、二十个小商小贩来往买卖东西，如今已设立了三百六十个商业分销店，每个生产队都有商店，各种生产资料、生活日用品，样样都有。今年上半年公社各商店营业总额达一百零六万八千七百元，比去年同期增加了48.8％。在生活日用百货方面，过去销售量较少的一些高档商品，如毛衣、绒衣、印花被单、球鞋、金笔、竹壳热水瓶等，今年的销售量直线上升。三洞管理区一千三百四十一户，六千一百一十五人，全队共计添置了毛衣一百件，灯芯绒衣一千四百二十件，球鞋七百九十五双，府绸、纺绸衣服三千多件，竹壳热水瓶九百多只。社员刘干子解放前打长工，一床棉被盖了三十一个冬天，从来没有过蚊帐；今年上半年夏收分配时，他分了一百多元现金，购置了一条印花新棉被，一条麻线新蚊帐。乐得刘干子口口声声称道公社好。
    公社化后，农民的物质生活大大提高了，文化生活又怎样呢？
    蒋巷公社建立后，兴办了一所正规的普通中学，一所半日制的农业中学，三十六所正规的普通小学和八十八所夜校和红专学校。入学的青少年儿童七百三十八人，学龄儿童已经全部入了学。而解放前，这里只有一所小学，入学的儿童不到一百个，而且大部分是地主和富农的儿女。公社化后不仅教育事业有了大发展，社员们的文化娱乐生活也日益丰富多彩。全公社有一个文化馆、一个图书馆、十八个文化站，里面置有各种报纸、杂志和通俗图书，供社员阅览。还有五十五个业余剧团，每逢节日、假日，社员们就可以看到自己剧团的演出。另外，还有一个广播站，装了三百二十五个喇叭，队队有嗽叭筒，每天劳动之余，社员们三五成群地围着喇叭筒听新闻广播和动人的戏曲音乐。
    过去，这里没有医院，也没有诊疗所，农民要看看病，买付药，就要跑到一、二十里路外的南昌市。公社化后情况大不相同了。公社在各管理区设立了五个医院、八个保健室，在各生产队设立了四十个医疗站、三十三个接生站。在这些医疗机构中工作的有四十八名中医和西医，一百多名护理员、助产员和不脱产的保健员、接生员。社员有个伤风感冒、头痛发烧的病痛，不用出村就能得到治疗；有了较严重的疾病，也不用跑到南昌市去找医院了。社员们看病只收医药成本费，住院只按供给标准加收伙食费，诊疗手续费用完全由公社负担。因此，社员们人人夸赞公社的医院好。
