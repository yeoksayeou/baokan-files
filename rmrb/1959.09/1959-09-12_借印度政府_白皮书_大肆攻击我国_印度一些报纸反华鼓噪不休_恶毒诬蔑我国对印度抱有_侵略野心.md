Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 10th. After Indian Prime Minister Nehru released a "White Paper" to the parliament on September 7th, containing documents exchanged between the Chinese and Indian governments from 1954 to 1959, some Indian newspapers immediately seized upon this "White Paper" to write anti-China articles, stirring up a wave of clamor. They vigorously promoted the "McMahon Line" as the Sino-Indian border and, using this border that has never been recognized by the Chinese government as the "basis," attacked China for harboring "aggressive ambitions" towards India.

	The "Leader" newspaper, in an editorial on the 10th titled "New Imperialism," cursed China with the most vicious words and threatened China with war. It said, "Now a question has arisen as to whether China has abandoned the Bandung Principles and whether it is heading towards imperialism. To abandon the Bandung Principles is to want war... If China continues to encroach on the Indian border, it will pave the way for a world war. No matter who wins or loses in this war, China will be destroyed." It threatened, "We will never give up an inch of Indian territory to appease China. If Zhou Enlai believes in peace, if he wants Asian solidarity—which is important for its security—to be maintained, he should tear up the new Chinese maps issued by his government based on imperialism, retrace his steps, and peacefully resolve the border dispute with India."
	"The Statesman" in its commentary on the 10th, slandered China's rejection of the McMahon Line as "seriously determined to harbor aggressive ambitions towards India" and as "a bomb thrown at India." It avoided mentioning India's use of force to change the existing Sino-Indian border situation, but instead turned around and accused China, saying that China's "high-handed methods are unprecedented." The newspaper insisted that "China has forgotten Panchsheel," and advocated: "After we have been accused of inciting rebellion and the McMahon Line has been denied, there is no point in arguing about anything. We now have to consider the question of whether to restore our relations with China. But if there is no such possibility, and China insists on its stubborn stance, then we should decide on India's national policy and defense responsibilities."
	"Amrita Bazar Patrika" also held the same view, saying that the White Paper shows that "behind China's planned aggression in the last five years there is a set of methods." Ignoring the fact that India had invaded Chinese territory, it portrayed India as a poor lamb. It said, "When China annexed Tibet, people received the first shock; although the Indian government and the Congress Party, which belongs to the leading position, cautiously avoided taking a positive attitude in order to avoid offending Beijing, the language used in the Chinese official notes became more and more arrogant and more and more impolite."
	Those Indian newspapers that used the most vicious words to insult China actually shouted that the "language was rude and impolite" in the Chinese government's letters to the Indian government. "The Tribune" reversed black and white and pretended to be pitiful, saying that it cannot imagine "India or any self-respecting country would give up what is indisputably their territory in this matter in order to appease a neighboring country that aims to plunder, no matter how powerful it is." It slandered China's position and reasonable solution on the Sino-Indian border issue as "both absurd and extremely nonsensical," and maliciously said, "Indian decision-makers had better remember the saying: Be careful when dealing with bad people."
	The "Times of India" on the 9th supported Nehru's argument of negotiating "adjustments" to the two countries' borders based on the "McMahon Line" in an editorial titled "Black Record." It advocated "taking a more resolute attitude on the northern border issue of India."
	This newspaper insisted that the Chinese government's non-recognition of the McMahon Line was "a violation of international practice," saying that "boundaries determined by geography, custom, and agreement cannot normally be changed simply because one of the countries concerned has broken away from colonial status and achieved independence." However, everyone knows that what India inherited in terms of the McMahon Line was a product of British imperialism's aggression against China, and it has never been recognized by the Chinese central government.
	In this wave of clamor, some newspapers clamored that China was "perfidious." "The Statesman" on the 10th slandered China for "regarding agreements as merely pieces of paper... Once the situation becomes unfavorable, they are discarded as waste paper." "The Statesman" even found the words to attack China from US President Eisenhower, saying, "The Indian people used to oppose Eisenhower's statement that communists cannot be trusted in abiding by treaties. But today, our country faces a similar situation. Zhou Enlai's assurances to Nehru have disappeared today." "The Statesman" and "The Hindustan Times" on the 8th distorted Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks to Prime Minister Nehru in 1956 regarding the Sino-Indian border issue as acknowledging the McMahon Line as the Sino-Indian border, and insisted that "he later broke his promise." "The Statesman" then concluded that Sino-Indian friendship and Panchsheel sounded doubtful and fake. "The Hindustan Daily" falsely accused, "China will definitely intensify international tensions by creating border disputes and quarrels with its neighbors...". "The Hindustan Times" took the opportunity to sow discord between Asian countries and China, exaggerating, "Indian public opinion today is very critical of China. Neutral Asian countries are losing trust in Beijing. The Bandung spirit is being undermined. The Tibetan tragedy may be the beginning of a new awakening for Asian countries." Obviously, these newspapers are using these slanders to cover up their own attempts to undermine Sino-Indian friendship, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and create tension.

### 借印度政府“白皮书”大肆攻击我国  印度一些报纸反华鼓噪不休  恶毒诬蔑我国对印度抱有“侵略野心”

    借印度政府“白皮书”大肆攻击我国
    印度一些报纸反华鼓噪不休
    恶毒诬蔑我国对印度抱有“侵略野心”
    新华社新德里10日电　印度总理尼赫鲁9月7日向议会公布了中印两国政府1954—1959年期间互换的各项文件的“白皮书”以后，印度一些报纸紧接着在这个“白皮书”上大做反华文章，掀起一阵鼓噪。它们极力鼓吹“麦克马洪线”是中印边界线，并且以这个从来没有得到中国政府承认的边界线为“依据”，攻击中国对印度抱有“侵略野心”。
    “领袖报”10日在一篇题为“新帝国主义”的社论中用最恶毒的字眼咒骂中国，用战争威胁中国。它说，“现在产生了一个问题，中国是否已经放弃了万隆原则，它是否在走向帝国主义。不要万隆原则就是要战争……如果中国继续侵犯印度边境，它将为世界大战铺平道路。不管谁可能在这场战争中打胜或打败，中国将被毁灭。”它威胁说，“我们决不会为了姑息中国而放弃一寸印度领土。如果周恩来相信和平，如果他希望亚洲的团结——这对它的安全来说是重要的——应当得到维护，他就应当撕毁他们政府发行的、以帝国主义为基础的新的中国地图，折回他的脚步，和平地解决同印度的边境纠纷。”
    “文汇报”在10日的评论中诬蔑中国拒绝麦克马洪线是“认真地决定要对印度抱有侵略野心”，是“投向印度的一枚炸弹。”它对印度使用武力改变现存中印边境现状的作法避而不谈，却反咬一口说，中国的“高压手段是史无前例的。”报纸硬说，“中国忘掉了潘查希拉”，并且主张：“在我们被指责为煽动叛乱和麦克马洪线被否认以后，争论任何问题都是没有用处的。我们现在不得不考虑是否要恢复我们同中国的关系的问题。但是假如没有这种可能性，中国坚持它顽固的立场，那么我们就应该决定印度的国家政治和防御责任。”
    “甘露市场报”也持同样的论调，说白皮书表明“在最近五年内中国的有计划的侵略背后是有一套办法的。”它不顾印度侵入中国领土的事实，而把印度描绘成一只可怜的羔羊。它说，“当中国吞并西藏的时候，人们受到了第一次震动；虽然印度政府和属于领导地位的政党国大党谨慎小心地避免采取积极的态度，以免触怒北京，中国官方照会中所使用的语言还是越来越傲慢，越来越不客气。”
    那些用尽恶毒字眼辱骂中国的印度报刊，居然大叫中国政府给印度政府的信件中“语言粗暴、不礼貌”。“论坛报”颠倒黑白并且装出一副可怜相说，不能想像“印度或任何有自尊心的国家在这个问题方面会放弃不可争辩地是它们的领土，以便来姑息一个以掠夺为目的的邻邦，不管它多么强大。”它把中国在中印边界问题的立场和合情合理的解决办法诬蔑为“既荒谬又是极端胡闹的”，并且恶意地说，“印度决策人最好记住这样一句格言：跟坏人交往要当心。”
    “印度时报”9日在题为“黑纪录”的社论中支持尼赫鲁提出的以“麦克马洪线”为基础来谈判“调整”两国边界的论点。它主张“对印度北部边境问题采取更加坚决的态度。”
    这家报纸硬说中国政府不承认麦克马洪线是“违反国际惯例”，它说，“地理、惯例、和协定所确定的边界在通常情况下是不能仅仅因为有关国家之一摆脱殖民地地位取得独立而加改变的。”但是，大家知道，印度在麦克马洪线方面所承袭的是英帝国主义对中国进行侵略的产物，它从来没有得到中国中央政府的承认。
    在这一阵鼓噪中，一些报纸大肆叫嚷中国“背信弃义”。“荣耀报”10日诬蔑中国“把协定仅仅看成几张纸……一当情况变得不利的时候，它们就被当作废纸丢掉了。”“光荣报”竟从美国的艾森豪威尔那里找到了攻击中国的辞汇，它说，“印度人民过去常常反对艾森豪威尔的这个说法：在遵守条约方面是不能信任共产党人的。但是今天，我们国家面临了相似的局势。周恩来给尼赫鲁的保证今天已经不见了。”“政治家报”和“印度斯坦时报”8日把周恩来总理1956年对尼赫鲁总理发表的关于中印边界问题的谈话，曲解为承认麦克马洪线为中印两国边界，并且硬说“他后来又背信食言了。”“政治家报”从而还得出结论说，中印友谊、潘查希拉听起来令人怀疑，而像是假的了。“印度斯坦日报”反诬说，“中国肯定将会用制造同它邻国的边境纠纷及争吵的办法，……加剧国际紧张局势。”“印度民族日报”趁机挑拨亚洲国家同中国的关系，大肆渲染说，“印度今天的舆论对中国批评得非常厉害。亚洲的中立国家在对北京失去信任。万隆气氛在受到破坏。西藏悲剧可能是亚洲国家新的觉悟的开端。”显然，这些报纸是在用这些诬蔑来掩盖它们自己想破坏中印友谊、和平共处五项原则和制造紧张局势的企图。
