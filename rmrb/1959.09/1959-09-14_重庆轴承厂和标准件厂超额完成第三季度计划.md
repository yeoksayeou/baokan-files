    重庆轴承厂和标准件厂超额完成第三季度计划
    据新华社重庆13日电　重庆轴承厂和重庆标准件厂的职工，分别以提前二十二天半和二十二天全面超额完成第三季度国家计划的成绩，向伟大的国庆十周年献礼。
    这两个厂的职工认真学习了党的八届八中全会的公报和决议以后，都结合9月份计划展开鸣放辩论，总结了7、8月份大搞群众运动的经验，修订了计划。重庆轴承厂职工修订生产计划以后，各车间小组和个人按旬按周按日编制了作业计划，做到了人人心中有数，个个方向明确，对生产关键问题也一一进行了分类排队，对原料材料供应、运输和机器检修等工作都作出了具体的安排，指定专人负责处理。重庆标准件厂的职工在修订计划以后，也增加了具体措施，并针对某些品种质量不够好，进行了找问题、找原因、找办法的“三找”专题鸣放辩论，根据找出的问题，及时由领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合研究解决。
    大闹技术革新和技术革命，深入开展对手竞赛，也是这两个厂的职工在大战9月中的共同特点。重庆标准件厂工人开展对手竞赛，进一步掀起增产节约新高潮，新纪录不断涌现。重庆轴承厂的工人们也纷纷革新技术，改进操作方法，解决生产关键，更进一步推动了生产迅速发展。如轧制一块铁皮由四道工序改为三道工序后，轧片组的班产量猛烈上升，9月1日至8日的平均日产量比上月的最高日产量还高85％，并且保证了产品质量合乎要求。
