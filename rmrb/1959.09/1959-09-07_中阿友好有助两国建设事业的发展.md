    Sino-Afghan Friendship Promotes the Development of Construction Undertakings in Both Countries
    Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming Deputy Prime Minister Naim

    Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet welcoming Afghan Deputy Prime Minister Prince Naim is as follows: Respected Deputy Prime Minister, friends, comrades:

    Tonight, at this banquet filled with the friendship between the Chinese and Afghan people, please allow me, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to extend a warm welcome to His Royal Highness Sardar Mohammad Naim, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the friendly neighboring country of Afghanistan, and the distinguished Afghan guests accompanying him, and to express my sincere gratitude for your visit from afar.

    China and Afghanistan have a long and profound friendship. Close economic and cultural exchanges began as early as two thousand years ago. The famous "Silk Road" has been a symbol of the friendly relations between our two peoples for a considerable period of history. In the past century, while the Chinese people were engaged in an unyielding struggle against foreign aggressors, they have always watched with admiration the heroic struggle of the Afghan people to safeguard national independence and oppose colonialism. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, China and Afghanistan officially established diplomatic relations in 1955. Thanks to the joint efforts of the two governments, especially the mutual visits of the two Prime Ministers and this visit of Your Royal Highness the Deputy Prime Minister, the friendly relations between our two countries, which have been restored and developed on a new basis, have been and are being further strengthened.

    Afghanistan pursues a policy of peace and neutrality in its foreign relations. Not long ago, His Majesty King Zahir, in his speech commemorating the forty-first anniversary of Afghanistan's independence, pointed out that Afghanistan's policy of supporting peace and friendship with all countries is based on a noble belief, namely, to achieve peace, security, mutual trust, and international cooperation through this policy. Prime Minister Sardar Mohammad Daoud and his closest aide, His Royal Highness Naim, have faithfully implemented this wise policy, setting a good example in the Asian and African regions. Afghanistan has won the respect and praise of the Chinese people and all peace-loving countries and peoples for consistently pursuing this foreign policy, which is both beneficial to its own people and conducive to the cause of world peace.

    We are pleased to see that, thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries and peoples all over the world, the current international situation is developing in a direction favorable to peace. The Chinese people welcome the upcoming mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States, as this is beneficial to further easing international tensions and safeguarding the cause of world peace. However, we cannot fail to note that the imperialists are stepping up their efforts to create tensions in the Far East and provoke relations between Asian and African countries, which is worthy of serious vigilance on the part of the governments and peoples of all Asian and African countries.

    Your Royal Highness the Deputy Prime Minister, during your visit to our country, you will have the opportunity to see that, inspired by the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, the Chinese people are continuing to leap forward vigorously, striving to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year. You can also see that the rural people's communes are increasingly playing their superior role, and the cultural and educational undertakings are also developing vigorously.

    Your Royal Highness the Deputy Prime Minister, the Chinese people are equally pleased to see that the Afghan people have achieved positive successes in developing their economic undertakings. We firmly believe that, on the basis of friendly cooperation, close exchange of experiences and mutual support between China and Afghanistan will help the development of our two countries' construction undertakings. We sincerely hope that Your Royal Highness and the distinguished guests will offer valuable suggestions on our various construction works during your visit to our country.

    Your Royal Highness the Deputy Prime Minister, I hope that you and your entourage will have a pleasant visit to our country.

    I propose a toast:
    For the prosperity of the Kingdom of Afghanistan and the happiness of the Afghan people!
    For the friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples!
    For peace in Asia and the world!
    To the health of His Royal Highness Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Mohammad Naim and all the distinguished guests accompanying him!
    To the health of His Majesty King Mohammad Zahir!
    Cheers!

    Prince Naim's Speech

    Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: The full text of the speech by Afghan Deputy Prime Minister Prince Naim at the welcoming banquet hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai is as follows: Mr. Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

    First of all, I would like to thank Your Excellency the Prime Minister for his kind invitation which has given me the opportunity to attend this friendly gathering.

    My presence here with you all is the result of historical developments, developments which over generations have strengthened the bonds of friendship between Afghanistan and China. I say generations, not years or decades, because I have in mind the cultural exchanges which since ancient times have linked our two neighbor countries with understanding, sympathy and mutual respect.

    I bring with me on this visit the friendship of the Afghan people for the Chinese people. Our government and people are following with admiration and pleasure, and with great interest, the tremendous strides your ancient country is making on the road to progress and prosperity. We wish your great efforts every success, and look forward with pleasure and confidence to even greater achievements in our great neighbor.

    In recent years, personal contacts between the leaders of our two countries have further promoted and consolidated our long-standing friendship. Your Excellency's memorable visit to Afghanistan and Sardar Mohammad Daoud's visit to China the year before last, greatly promoted the cause of consolidating the friendship between our two countries. These pleasant visits have strengthened our belief that such meetings and contacts will always contribute to the cause of understanding, mutual trust and friendship between nations.

    In foreign policy, we remain above all loyal to our policy of neutrality. But this neutrality should not be confused with indifference to the important problems of international significance which are casting their shadow over the world family in which we live. As a member of the United Nations, my country is loyal to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, actively strives for friendship among all nations, and is willing to cooperate with every country in making every effort to maintain peace. We are convinced that the goodwill and genuine trust generated by friendship and increased understanding between nations is the most effective factor in guaranteeing and maintaining peace. We have repeatedly reaffirmed our belief in peaceful coexistence. I am pleased to cite the amicable relations existing between our two countries as a living example of peaceful cooperation between two countries with different political, economic and social systems.

    The painful experiences of the Asian and African countries over the past two centuries, and the struggles and sacrifices they have made in their fight for independence, are the driving forces behind the unity of these countries around the principles formulated at the Bandung Conference. These principles have laid a solid foundation for harmony and understanding between the countries of the Asian and African regions, and they are a positive asset that benefits the cause of peace throughout the world. We hope with the utmost sincerity that no factors will be allowed to undermine this harmonious understanding between the countries of the Asian and African regions.

    Our commitment to the cause of peace is inspired not only by certain general humanitarian considerations, but also by the urgent needs of our daily work. A series of events over the past two centuries have forced our people to devote all their efforts to self-defense, to the point that we have been unable to engage in constructive work to develop the economy. Now we must make up for the past. The tasks we face can only be accomplished in an atmosphere of peace and international security.

    I regret to say that we are living in an era of tension and deep concern. The problems facing mankind are enormous and indeed frightening, but they harbor far greater dangers. The destructive power of existing weapons is a matter of concern to all countries and peoples. In our time, the arms race is likely to lead to the destruction of mankind. We hope that the enormous energy currently and in the future possessed by scientific knowledge can be used to serve the great cause of improving people's lives.

    Another source of friction is the obstacles placed in the path of certain countries that have not yet realized their legitimate aspirations in their struggle for freedom. We hope that the rightful rights to freedom will soon be universally recognized, and that freedom and justice will prevail throughout the world.

    I do not think that the views I am expressing now are pessimistic, but these troubling thoughts are caused by the events of the last decade. However, our government and the Afghan people believe that the proposed mutual visits between the Soviet Premier and the American President are highly commendable. We sincerely hope that these meetings and direct contacts will lead to an easing of tensions and make the prospects for world peace more realistic.

    Your Excellency, please allow me to once again express my gratitude to you and through you to the people of your great country for the warm hospitality we have received here. My companions and I are confident that our experiences during our stay in your great country, and our understanding of your achievements in all aspects, will be beneficial to our own task of economic development.

    Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!

    I ask you all to join me in a toast:
    To the health of our distinguished host, His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai!
    To the prosperity and happiness of the People's Republic of China!
    To the friendship between the Afghan and Chinese peoples!
    To friendship and understanding among all nations!
    To world peace!
    To the health of His Excellency Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China!
    Cheers!

    中阿友好有助两国建设事业的发展
    在欢迎纳伊姆副首相的宴会上
    周恩来总理讲话
    新华社6日讯　周恩来总理在欢迎阿富汗王国副首相纳伊姆亲王宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的副首相殿下，朋友们，同志们：
    今天晚上，在这个充满着中阿两国人民友谊的宴会上，请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向来自友好邻邦阿富汗王国的副首相兼外交大臣萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆殿下和随同前来的阿富汗贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎并且对贵宾们远道来访表示衷心的感谢。
    中国和阿富汗有着悠久而深厚的友谊，早在二千多年前就已经开始了密切的经济和文化往来。著名的“丝绸之路”，在一个相当长的历史时期内，一直是我们两国人民友好关系的标志。近百年来，中国人民在同外国侵略者进行不屈不挠的斗争的时候，一直怀着敬佩的心情注视着阿富汗人民为维护民族独立反对殖民主义而进行的英勇斗争。中华人民共和国成立以后，中阿两国在1955年正式建立了外交关系。由于两国政府的共同努力，特别是两国总理的互相访问和副首相殿下的这次访问，我们两国之间在新的基础上恢复和发展起来的友好关系，已经和正在进一步加强起来。
    阿富汗在对外关系上执行着和平中立的政策。不久以前，查希尔国王陛下在纪念阿富汗独立四十一周年的演说中指出，阿富汗所以采取支持和平和同各国友好的政策是基于一种崇高的信念，即通过这种政策达到和平、安全、相互信任和国际合作的目的。萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德首相和他最亲密的助手纳伊姆殿下忠诚地执行了这一明智的政策，在亚非地区树立了良好的范例。阿富汗因为一贯奉行这种既有利于本国人民又有益于世界和平事业的对外政策而赢得了中国人民和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的尊敬和赞扬。
    我们高兴地看到，由于苏联和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，目前国际形势正朝着有利于和平的方向发展。中国人民对苏美两国首脑即将进行互相访问表示欢迎，因为这对于进一步和缓国际紧张局势和维护世界和平事业是有益的。但是，我们也不能不注意到，帝国主义者正在远东加紧制造紧张局势，挑拨亚非各国的关系，这是值得一切亚非国家的政府和人民严重警惕的。
    副首相殿下，你在访问我国期间将有机会看到，中国人民在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下和在1958年大跃进的基础上，正在轰轰烈烈地继续跃进，为在今年内提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而努力。你还可以看到，农村人民公社正在日益发挥它的优越作用，文化教育事业也在蓬勃地发展。
    副首相殿下，中国人民同样高兴地看到，阿富汗人民在发展经济事业中获得了积极的成就。我们深信，中阿两国在友好合作的基础上，密切地交流经验、互相支援，必将有助于我们两国建设事业的发展。我们诚恳地希望殿下和贵宾们在我国访问期间对于我们的各项建设工作提出宝贵的意见。
    副首相殿下，希望你和你的随行人员在访问我国期间将会感到愉快。
    我提议：
    为阿富汗王国的繁荣和阿富汗人民的幸福，
    为中阿两国人民的友谊，
    为亚洲和世界和平，
    为萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆副首相殿下和随行的全体贵宾们的健康，
    为穆罕默德·查希尔国王陛下的健康，
    干杯！
    纳伊姆亲王讲话
    新华社6日讯　阿富汗王国副首相纳伊姆亲王在周恩来总理举行的欢迎宴会上的讲话，全文如下：总理先生，阁下，女士们和先生们，
    首先，我要感谢总理阁下，他的亲切的邀请使我有机会来参加这个友好的聚会。
    我能够在这里同各位欢聚，是历史发展的结果，多少世代以来这些发展增强了阿富汗和中国之间的友谊联系。我说到世代，而不是说几年或几十年，因为我心里所想的是自古以来把我们这两个邻国用谅解、同情和相互尊重联系了起来的文化交流。
    我这次来访问，带来了阿富汗人民对中国人民的友谊。我国政府和人民以钦佩和愉快的心情，很感兴趣地注视着你们这个历史悠久的国家正在向进步和繁荣迈进的巨大的步伐。我们祝你们的伟大努力得到成功，并且以愉快的心情和信心预祝伟大邻国的更加伟大的成就。
  最近几年来，我们两国领导人之间的个人接触，进一步推动和巩固了我们的悠久友谊。阁下对阿富汗的值得记忆的访问以及前年萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德对中国的访问，大大促进了巩固我们两国之间的友谊的事业。这些愉快的访问坚定了我们的信念：这就是这种会见和接触将始终有助于各国间的了解，互信和友好的事业。
    在对外政策方面，我们首先始终忠于我们的中立政策。可是，这种中立不应该和那种对有国际意义的重大问题采取冷漠的态度混淆起来，这些重大问题的阴影正笼罩着我们生活在其中的世界大家庭。作为联合国的一个会员国，我国忠于联合国宪章的精神，积极争取一切国家相互友好，并且愿意为了维护和平而尽一切努力同每一个国家进行合作。我们确信，各国间友好和增进了解所产生的善意和真心的信任，是保证和维护和平的最有效的因素。我们曾一再重申我们对和平共处的信仰。我很愉快地援引存在于我们两国之间的友好关系，作为具有不同政治、经济和社会制度的两个国家和平合作的活的榜样。
    过去两个世纪来亚非国家的痛苦经历，和它们为争取独立而进行的斗争和付出的牺牲，是推动这些国家团结在万隆会议所制订的原则周围的动力。这些原则为亚非地区各国之间的和谐和了解奠定了巩固的基础，它们是有利于全世界和平事业的积极的财富。我们怀着最大的诚意希望，不要让任何因素来破坏亚非地区各国之间的这种和谐的了解。
    我们致力于和平事业，除了受到某些一般的人道主义考虑的鼓舞以外，也受到我们日常工作的迫切需要的激励。最近两世纪以来，有一系列的事件曾迫使我国人民用全付力量来进行自卫，以至于我们不能从事建设性的工作去发展经济。现在我们必须弥补过去。我们所面临的任务，只能在和平和国际安全的气氛下才能够完成。
    我很遗憾地说，我们是生活在一个局势紧张和有着深切忧虑的时代。人类所面临的问题是巨大的，也确实是可怕的，但是它们孕育着远为巨大的危险。目前已有的武器的破坏力是所有国家和人民所担忧的事情。在我们的时代里，军备竞赛很可能导致人类的毁灭。我们希望科学知识目前和将来所掌握的巨大的能量，能够用来服务于改善人们的生活的伟大事业。
    另一个产生磨擦的来源是那些设置在某些国家的前进道路上的障碍，这些国家在争取自由的斗争中，还没有实现它们的正当愿望。我们希望正当的自由权利能很快地得到普遍承认，自由和正义能在全世界占上风。
    我认为我现在所表明的观点不是出于悲观，但是这些使我烦恼的思想是由近十年来所发生的事件所引起的。然而，我国政府和阿富汗人民认为，建议中的苏联总理和美国总统之间的相互访问是十分值得赞扬的事。我们诚挚地希望这些会见和直接接触将导致紧张局势的和缓，并使世界和平的前景更为现实。
    阁下，请允许我再次向你并且通过你向你们伟大国家的人民表示感谢，感谢我们在这里所得到的亲切招待。我和我的同伴们确信，我们在你们伟大的国家里逗留期间的经历，以及对你们在各方面所取得的成就的了解，对于我们自己执行发展经济的任务将是有益的。
    各位阁下，女士们和先生们！
    我请你们大家和我一起，为
    我们的尊贵的主人，周恩来总理阁下的健康，
    为中华人民共和国的繁荣、幸福，
    为阿富汗和中国人民之间的友谊，
    为各国之间的友谊和了解，
    为世界和平，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇阁下的健康，
    干杯！
