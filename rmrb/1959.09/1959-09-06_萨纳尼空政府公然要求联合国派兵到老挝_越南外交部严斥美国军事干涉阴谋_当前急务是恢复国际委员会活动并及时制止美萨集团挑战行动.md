Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 5th: The Foreign Ministry of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement regarding the request by the Kingdom of Laos government for the United Nations to send emergency forces to Laos. The statement pointed out that this is part of the entire conspiracy of US imperialism and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to send military forces to interfere in Laos, with the aim of expanding the war in the region and seriously threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that the profound root causes and direct reasons for the current serious situation in Laos are the interference of US imperialism in Laos in order to turn Laos into its military base and directly threaten the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that as soon as peace was restored in Indochina, US imperialism tried every possible means to undermine the Geneva Accords on Laos, and tried every possible way to pull Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive military bloc, instigating the Kingdom of Laos government to abandon the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. Since the Laos International Commission temporarily ceased its activities, especially after the Phoui Sananikone group came to power, US imperialism has increasingly strengthened its interference in Laos, especially in military affairs. It instigated the Laotian government to provoke the civil war that is currently taking place in many parts of Laos.

The statement said: Under the planning of US imperialism, Laos and France signed a joint communiqué on July 23 this year. Since then, the United States has sent hundreds of new military advisors to Laos, and has continuously transported a large amount of weapons, including tanks, aircraft, etc., to Laos, in order to accelerate the realization of the US war preparation plan. On August 26 this year, the US government decided to provide Laos with emergency aid to strengthen the Lao army and the Lao armed police force. US weapons, ammunition and military supplies were rapidly airlifted from US military bases in the Far East to Laos. Important figures from the US and its vassal governments are constantly clamoring for military intervention in Laos.

The statement pointed out that it is very clear that US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government are the creators of the current civil war in many parts of Laos near the Vietnam-Laos border, which threatens the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and makes the situation in Indochina tense.

The statement said: In order to shirk responsibility and deceive the Lao people and world public opinion, US imperialism, the Sananikone government, and the United States' vassals in Southeast Asia have constantly slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in the internal affairs of Laos, saying that the Vietnamese People's Army attacked the Kingdom of Laos's Sam Neua Province, intending to use this as an excuse for the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc to carry out military intervention in Laos.

The statement said: The Sananikone government, under the orders of US imperialism, wrote to the United Nations, making unfounded slanders against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. According to today's news, the Sananikone government wrote again to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, requesting the United Nations to send emergency forces to Laos, claiming that this was to stop the so-called "aggression" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The statement said: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again strongly protests this blatant slander by US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government.

The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence with all countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always correctly adhered to the spirit of the 1954 Geneva Accords, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighboring countries, and resolutely not allowing any country to infringe upon its own sovereignty and territorial integrity under any pretext.

The statement pointed out that the current Lao issue is a matter of fulfilling the 1954 Geneva Accords on Laos. The statement said: In order to ensure the correct implementation of this agreement, the current urgent task is that the Laos International Commission must immediately resume its activities and promptly stop the challenge conspiracies and actions of US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government.

The statement said: In order to safeguard the 1954 Geneva Accords - an international agreement that has been recognized by major powers - for peace and justice, and for the lofty purposes of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations should immediately reject the unreasonable request of the Phoui Sananikone government to send emergency forces to Laos.

The statement concluded: The peaceful will of the Lao people, who have the sympathy and support of the peace-loving people of Southeast Asia and the world, will cause the conspiracy of US imperialism and the Sananikone government to expand the civil war in Laos to be miserably defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, September 5th, New York News: The Laotian Sananikone government, which tore up the Geneva Accords under the instigation of the United States and launched an anti-people civil war, formally requested the United Nations on the 4th to send so-called "emergency forces" to help it fight the civil war, in order to openly introduce US aggressors and destroy peace in Indochina.

In order to create an excuse for introducing imperialist armed forces, Laotian Foreign Minister Phoui Sananikone, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, attempted to fabricate the civil war provoked by the Sananikone government between itself and the former Lao combat forces as a so-called "aggression by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." The letter stated, "Since July 16 of this year, foreign troops have crossed the border and fought with the Kingdom's garrison forces stationed along the northeastern border of Laos." It also wrote: "On August 30, a new attack was launched on Meng Ai and Chuan Ge, with an intensity surpassing previous attacks. This attack was participated in by troops from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and supported by artillery set up on the other side of the border."

The letter shamelessly said: "Laos, facing this clear act of aggression for which the Democratic Republic of Vietnam must bear full responsibility, requests the United Nations organization, of which it is a member, to provide assistance in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 1, and Article 11, paragraph 2, of the United Nations Charter. The Kingdom Government specifically requests that an emergency force be sent in the shortest possible time to stop the aggression and prevent its spread."

It is reported that the United Nations Security Council is preparing to meet on the 6th or 7th to discuss the Sananikone government's request.

After the Kingdom of Laos government formally requested the United Nations to send troops to intervene, US State Department Press Officer White refused to explain on the 4th what decision the United States would take on Laos' request to the United Nations. Although White admitted that the news of the so-called Vietnamese "artillery support" fabricated by the Sananikone government "could not be confirmed," he groundlessly slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for "supporting Lao insurgents," and admitted that the United States' "support for the Lao government has been obvious in every aspect in the past."

The charade played by the United States and its puppet Sananikone government is so obvious. On the afternoon of the same day that the Sananikone government sent the letter to the United Nations, Acting US Secretary of State Dillon convened a meeting of the ambassadors to the United States from the eight member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to discuss "the possibility of the member states of this aggressive group providing assistance based on possible decisions made by the United Nations."

At the same time, some US politicians and bourgeois newspapers took the opportunity to launch warmongering calls. Democratic Congressman Omer Burleson and Congressman Clement Zablocki, Chairman of the House Far East Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, supported the United Nations sending troops to intervene in Laos, demanding that the United Nations take immediate action. US Tactical Air Force Commander Everest even threatened that as soon as the decision to send troops is made, "within thirty-five hours, US tactical air force squadrons can fly over Laos."

United Press International said, "If troops are sent to support Laos—whether sent by the United Nations or in accordance with the provisions of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Convention—these troops, like those in Korea, must mainly be US troops." It also said that the United States is the only country in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization that can quickly send a large number of troops to Laos.

    萨纳尼空政府公然要求联合国派兵到老挝
    越南外交部严斥美国军事干涉阴谋
    当前急务是恢复国际委员会活动并及时制止美萨集团挑战行动
    新华社河内5日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部今天就老挝王国政府要求联合国向老挝派遣紧急部队一事发表声明。声明指出，这是为了让美帝国主义和东南亚侵略集团派遣军事力量干涉老挝的全部阴谋的一部分，其目的在于扩大这个地区的战争，严重威胁越南民主共和国的安全。
    声明指出，产生当前老挝的严重局势的深远根源和直接原因，是美帝国主义为了把老挝变成它的军事基地，直接威胁越南民主共和国的安全而对老挝进行干涉。
    声明指出，印度支那的和平刚刚恢复，美帝国主义就千方百计地破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议，想尽办法要把老挝拉入东南亚侵略军事集团，唆使老挝王国政府背弃日内瓦协议和万象协议。自从老挝国际委员会暂时停止活动后，尤其是培·萨纳尼空集团执政之后，美帝国主义越来越加强对老挝的干涉，特别是在军事方面的干涉。它唆使老挝政府挑起了目前正在老挝许多地方进行的内战。
    声明说：在美帝国主义策划下，老挝和法国在今年7月23日签订了联合公报。此后，美国向老挝派遣了成百名新的军事顾问，接连不断地向老挝运进大量的武器，包括坦克、飞机等，以便加紧实现美国准备战争的计划。今年8月26日，美国政府又决定给老挝以紧急援助，以加强老挝的军队和老挝的武装警察力量。美国的武器、弹药和军用品从美国在远东的军事基地急速地空运到老挝。美国及其附庸国的政府的重要人物，不断叫嚣要对老挝进行军事干涉。
    声明指出，十分明显，美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府正是目前靠近越老边界的老挝许多地方的内战的制造者，它威胁了越南民主共和国的安全，使印度支那的局势紧张起来。
    声明说：为了推卸责任，欺骗老挝人民和世界舆论，美帝国主义、萨纳尼空政府和美国在东南亚的附庸们却不断诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝内政，说越南人民军进攻了老挝王国的桑怒省，打算以此作为东南亚军事侵略集团对老挝进行军事干涉的借口。
    声明说：萨纳尼空政府奉了美帝国主义的命令，写信给联合国，对越南民主共和国进行毫无根据的诬蔑。根据今天的消息，萨纳尼空政府又写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求联合国派遣紧急部队到老挝，据他们说，这是为了制止越南民主共和国的所谓“进攻”。声明说：越南民主共和国政府再一次强烈抗议美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府的这种粗暴诬蔑。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府一贯根据和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，奉行同各国和平共处的政策。
    越南民主共和国政府一贯正确按照1954年日内瓦协议的精神，尊重各邻国的主权和领土完整，并坚决不许任何国家以任何借口侵犯自己的主权和领土完整。
    声明指出：当前的老挝问题是履行1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议的问题。声明说：为了保障正确地履行这项协议，当前的急务是老挝国际委员会必须立即恢复活动，及时制止美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府的挑战阴谋和行动。
    声明说：为了维护1954年的日内瓦协议——曾经得到各大国承认的国际协议，为了和平和公理，为了联合国宪章的崇高目的，联合国应当立即驳斥培·萨纳尼空政府关于派遣紧急部队到老挝的无理要求。
    声明最后说：得到东南亚和全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持的老挝人民的和平意志，将使美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府扩大老挝内战的阴谋遭到惨败。
    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：在美国策动下撕毁日内瓦协议并且发动了反人民内战的老挝萨纳尼空政府，在4日正式要求联合国派遣所谓“紧急部队”帮助它打内战，以便公开引进美国侵略者，破坏印度支那的和平。
    为了替引进帝国主义武装制造借口，老挝外交大臣班维在递交给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的信中，企图把萨纳尼空政府挑起的它同前寮国战斗部队之间的内战，捏造成所谓“越南民主共和国的侵略”。信中说，“自今年7月16日以来，外国部队越过了边境并同驻在老挝东北边境沿线的王国守备部队发生了战斗。”并写道：“8月30日，对孟埃和川哥两地发动了一次新的攻击，其猛烈程度超越前几次的攻击，这次攻击有来自越南民主共和国的部队的参加并得到架设在边境那一边的大炮的支援。”
    信中无耻地说：“老挝面对着越南民主共和国应负全部责任的这种鲜明的侵略行为，请求自身为其一成员国的联合国组织依据联合国宪章第一条第一款和第十一条第二款给予帮助。王国政府特别请求在最短时期内派出一支紧急部队来制止侵略，阻止其蔓延。”
    据报道，联合国安全理事会准备在6日或7日开会讨论萨纳尼空政府的要求。
    在老挝王国政府正式要求联合国出兵干涉之后，美国国务院新闻发布官怀特4日拒绝说明美国对老挝向联合国的要求将采取什么决定。怀特虽然承认萨纳尼空政府骗造的所谓越南“大炮支援”的消息，“无法证实”，但是他又毫无根据地诬蔑越南民主共和国“支援寮国叛乱分子”，并且承认：美国“对老挝政府的支持过去在任何方面都是明显的。”
    美国和它操纵的萨纳尼空政府串演的这出双簧戏是如此明显，就在萨纳尼空政府向联合国发出那封信的当天，4日下午，美国代理国务卿狄龙就召集了东南亚条约组织八个成员国的驻美大使们举行会议，讨论了这个侵略集团的成员国“根据联合国可能作出的决定进行援助的可能性”。
    同时，美国的一些政客和资产阶级报刊乘机发起了好战的叫嚷。民主党议员欧默尔·伯勒森和众议院远东外交小组委员会主席克来门特·扎布洛基赞成联合国出兵干涉老挝，要求联合国立即采取行动。美国战术空军司令埃弗雷斯特更威胁说，只要决定出兵，“三十五小时内，美国的战术空军机群就可以飞临老挝的上空。”
    合众国际社说，“如果派军队支援老挝——不论是联合国派遣还是按照东南亚条约组织公约的规定派遣——这些军队将像在朝鲜一样，主要必须是美国军队。”并说，美国是东南亚条约组织国家中能够迅速派遣大量军队到老挝的唯一的国家。
