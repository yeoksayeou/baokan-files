Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: TASS, Washington - Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech at the National Press Club in Washington on the 16th. The full text is as follows: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen!

I am very pleased to meet with prominent American journalists at the beginning of my visit. I have had the opportunity more than once to experience that journalists are very inquisitive people. They want to know everything at once, and they have a very rich imagination. You have asked me so many questions that if I were to answer them one by one, I would have to stay here for half a year. What do you say, if I stayed here for half a year, would you object? Thank you in advance. But I have to hurry back to Moscow to receive your esteemed President in our country!

Striving to improve Soviet-American relations and consolidate world peace is the main purpose of the visit to the United States

I am here talking to you, and I will try to satisfy your curiosity and talk briefly about some issues related to my visit to the United States.

I once called journalists my fellow travelers during a conversation with reporters in Moscow. Indeed, many of you will be my fellow travelers during my visit to various parts of the United States. I sincerely hope that you are all active and objective good fellow travelers, because the truthful news about our visit to the United States largely depends on you journalists. You will hear my talks and speeches and report my remarks. I ask you, gentlemen, to try to understand my meaning correctly and report what I say correctly. If I occasionally misspeak, it would be best if you ask me again, and I will be very willing to answer you, because I don't want any misinterpreted words to go against my original intention.

People often ask me what results can be expected from our visit. We only arrived in the U.S. capital yesterday, and it is too early to try to predict the results of our visit. You know, weather stations have a lot of difficulty predicting the weather for the next day, and political predictions are certainly not easier.

However, judging from our first day of meetings and talks in Washington, I can say that the barometer points to "fair."

We have almost two weeks ahead of us. We will learn about your country, understand the lives of the people, and hold talks with President Eisenhower on issues of mutual interest. I haven't met with your President for a long time. His outstanding talents are highly respected in the Soviet Union. Our contact has mainly been maintained through ambassadors or by exchanging letters in the past. Obviously, such contact cannot replace direct communication and frank conversation.

Of course, you don't expect me to say everything here that I have already discussed with the President or intend to discuss. However, some things must be discussed, otherwise, you will not have a correct understanding of the Soviet Union's position on major international issues.

First of all, I want to emphasize that we have come here with the best wishes and sincere hearts. We bring with us the friendship of the American people and the sincere desire to improve relations between our two countries and consolidate world peace. This is the main purpose of our visit.

Solving the disarmament issue is the best and most reliable way to make war impossible

We want to consult with your government on extremely important issues. There are many of these issues. However, first of all, I want to raise the issues of easing international tensions and eliminating the "Cold War," the issue of disarmament, the issue of a peace treaty with Germany, the issue of world trade, and the issue of improving relations between our two countries.

I believe that the President and I will focus our talks on the issue of eliminating the "Cold War" and consolidating peace, and the issue of easing international tensions.

Not long ago, your President said that we should consider the question of how long the arms race and the state of tension in international relations can continue, and whether the world has not yet reached the point where it might explode. We fully agree with the dissatisfaction and concern expressed in these words about the existing international situation.

If we look back at history, it is not difficult to see that, unfortunately, until now, wars in which people slaughtered each other have been a frequent phenomenon in human society. Although mankind is constantly moving forward along the path of progress, every step forward mankind takes, war becomes more destructive. War takes more and more lives, and the flames of war spread to larger and larger territories.

In the twentieth century, mankind has already endured two world wars, which caused greater sacrifices than any previous war. Since people learned to master atomic energy and created rockets that can fly thousands of kilometers in a few minutes, the most sophisticated aircraft, warships, and tanks used in the Second World War have become almost like toys compared to the latest combat weapons. In this situation, it would be madness to allow a new world war to break out.

Ensuring peace and permanently eliminating war from the life of human society is the lofty goal that the people of all countries aspire to. Our century has produced new means of mass destruction, but it has also made people understand the need to prevent war and guarantee peace. The powerful peace movement serves this noble purpose. We are convinced that war is not inevitable in our time. It is possible and necessary to free people from the fear of the scourge of war.

The best and most reliable way to make war impossible is to bring all countries, without exception, to a state where they do not possess the means to wage war, in other words, to solve the issue of disarmament. Of course, disarmament will affect the most sensitive interests of all countries - their security interests, and will involve the realm of secret intelligence that any country is reluctant to give up, especially in the context of international tension and mutual suspicion.

I cannot predict what I will talk about at the United Nations General Assembly meeting the day after tomorrow, but I can tell you that I am prepared to focus primarily on the issue of disarmament. The Soviet government will submit a proposal for discussion by the United Nations, and we hope that this proposal will play a significant role in solving the most pressing problems of our time.

Without a peace treaty with Germany, the relations of dozens of countries will be poisoned; without eliminating the remnants of the last war, conditions for lasting peace in Europe cannot be provided.

There are other pressing international issues. The Soviet Union believes that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is of great significance, which, of course, is not news to you. If we do not want another world war to break out, now is the time to completely resolve the problems left over from the Second World War.

Why do we so firmly advocate the final conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany? This is because without a peace treaty, the relations between dozens of countries will be poisoned. Without eliminating the remnants of the last war, conditions for lasting peace in Europe cannot be provided. It cannot be guaranteed that these remnants will not fertilize the soil for a new war. I am very aware of the role of fertilizers in agriculture, but I am opposed to such fertilizers in politics.

We are deeply convinced that such a situation is intolerable: Fourteen years have passed since the end of the Second World War, and the countries that fought against Germany have not yet signed a peace treaty with Germany, thus preserving the occupation regime in West Germany.

Sometimes one can hear some Americans say: Europe is far away from us, there are two Germanys on German territory, one of which is even an ally of the United States, and everyone knows that it doesn't hurt to have one more ally. It is said that we can get by without a peace treaty.

Please forgive me for saying: Only a reckless person would say such a thing. Please think about it, in the life of a generation, your country has had to send its sons to the European battlefield twice to fight against Germany. What would happen if your current ally, West Germany, provoked a third world war? Under the current conditions, it would no longer be just a matter of sending American children to battlefields far from the American coast. By then, the territory of any belligerent country would become a battlefield. Modern means of destruction would ignite the entire world in an instant.

You must understand that we are mentioning the dangers of not signing a peace treaty with Germany not because we are afraid of German militarists in any way. We have enough power to restrain the revanchists, and if necessary, we can make them sober up. However, you will agree that we cannot ignore the fact that some people in West Germany are planning to create conflicts between the Soviet Union and other countries, exacerbate relations between them, and put the world in a state of tension. As everyone knows, the post-war development of Europe and Germany has led to the establishment of two Germanys. Regardless of our wishes and our attitude towards them, these two countries exist, and we should consider this. The most correct policy is a realistic policy. There is only one way out: agree that there are two Germanys, that is, recognize the status quo on the German question, and no longer delay eliminating the remnants of the war and concluding peace treaties with the two Germanys.

If only one possibility is allowed - to conclude a peace treaty only with a unified Germany (which is of course the best), then this actually means canceling the issue of a peace treaty.

With the conclusion of a peace treaty, the Berlin issue, which causes frequent friction between countries, would also be completely resolved. Sometimes one hears such a statement, it seems that the Berlin issue did not exist a year ago, and the situation in Berlin was not bad. But, do we have to wait until a seemingly small disturbance in Berlin leads to the roar of cannons? We advocate taking measures to prevent conflicts in advance.

Neither the Soviet Union nor the German Democratic Republic has any ulterior motives or secret intentions towards West Berlin. No one is forcing West Berlin to merge into the German Democratic Republic, nor is anyone forcing a change in the existing social system and economic systems there.

The communique issued after the talks between the heads of government of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany at the end of last month stated that President Eisenhower reiterated "the promise of the United States and its allies to protect the freedom and happiness of the residents of Berlin." Well, this statement also corresponds to our wishes. The Soviet Union has stated that, under the current conditions, the wisest thing is to declare West Berlin a free city. We have in the past and continue to propose using the most reliable guarantee methods in international practice, with or without the participation of the United Nations, to ensure the independent existence of West Berlin. This would guarantee the freedom and happiness of the residents of West Berlin.

At the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, there was some convergence of positions between the Western three countries and the Soviet Union, and everyone had a better understanding of each other's intentions and positions. We believe this is a good sign. But there are still some outstanding issues that need to be negotiated. If I said that these issues would not be touched upon in the upcoming talks, you would not believe me in any way.

The question of how to live and what ideological systems and viewpoints to adhere to should be resolved by the people of each country themselves, free from external interference.

We know that Americans are freedom-loving people, and they are prepared, as in the past, to defend their beliefs, to defend the right to live in a way they deem appropriate. The Soviet people also cherish this feeling. If you say that you have this right, you cannot fail to allow others to enjoy this right, no matter what your views are on which country's system and social system is better. The question of how to live and what ideological systems and viewpoints to adhere to should be resolved by the people themselves, free from external interference.

The Soviet Union advocates developing relations between countries based on the principle of peaceful coexistence. These principles are the legacy given to us by the great founder of the Soviet state, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. We are faithful to these principles. We believe that differences in worldviews should not harm relations between countries. Close economic and cultural ties should be established between all countries in the world. This will help the people of all countries and national leaders to understand and better understand each other more deeply. This will promote the establishment of mutual trust and peaceful coexistence.

The Soviet Union and the United States face such a choice: either use the latest achievements in science and technology - uncovering the mysteries of the atom, manufacturing rockets, exploring the universe - to serve a peaceful future and the prosperity of mankind; or use these achievements for purposes of destruction and annihilation, thereby filling the earth with graves and ashes.

The Soviet people made a choice in favor of peace long ago.

The world's first nuclear power plant was built in the Soviet Union, and it has been working for peaceful purposes for five years; the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial earth satellite and the first artificial planet into the universe, which was made and launched into space by human genius! Don't these facts convincingly illustrate this point?

Does the brilliant achievement of Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers being the first in the world to create and realize a space flight from Earth to another celestial body - the Moon - not illustrate this point? A huge container with scientific and measuring instruments and markings engraved with the Soviet national emblem was sent to the surface of the Moon; this peaceful feat of the Soviet people greatly expanded the boundaries of human understanding, and it shows how brilliant peaks mankind will reach if they devote all their energy to peaceful endeavors and use them to achieve peaceful goals.

Before we set off for the United States, the powerful "Lenin" nuclear icebreaker had already set sail. It will soon break through the ice of the Arctic Ocean, opening up roads for ships carrying the most peaceful cargo to supply peaceful people.

We believe that the American people also advocate peace. But if our interests coincide on the most important issue of ensuring peace, then we must be in step, unite our strength and energy, and strive to vigorously change the international climate. Therefore, let us think about how we should realize Soviet-American cooperation.

As for the Soviet Union, it is willing to consider any proposal that helps to improve good neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. It is understandable that efforts must be made by both sides, or as you like to say, each must go halfway to meet each other.

Of course, it is impossible to do this all at once. It would be too naive to think that we will wake up one morning and see that all disputes have been resolved and all differences have been eliminated. Too many misunderstandings and prejudices have accumulated from the "Cold War." However, the Soviet government believes that if we work together stubbornly, it is entirely possible to dispel the clouds in our bilateral relations.

Compare today's international situation with the situation in the past, say, five or six years ago. Now there are some signs of easing the "Cold War." We must promote the disappearance of the "Cold War" as soon as possible. The people in the press (people also call newspapers "great powers", it seems this is not without reason) can do a lot for the realization of this goal.

The Soviet people are pleased that, recently, there have been improvements in Soviet-American relations. I am referring to the development of direct contacts between national leaders, such as Mikoyan and Kozlov's visits to the United States and Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union. The Soviet exhibition in New York and the American exhibition in Moscow were major events. I was very happy to visit your exhibition with Mr. Nixon. I had a warm and beneficial conversation with him there.

We are also prepared to do everything possible to develop world trade. We should eliminate the bankrupt policy of trade discrimination, thereby clarifying the atmosphere in relations between countries.

For example, can we consider the current volume of Soviet-American trade to be normal? You know, all the goods exchanged between our two countries in a year can only fill two ships. However, our two countries account for more than half of the world's industrial production. May I ask, what purpose does the policy of trade discrimination achieve, and what does it serve? If we look at things rationally, then this policy only serves one purpose - to maintain distrust in our bilateral relations.

Trade is a barometer; it indicates which direction the policy is developing: will the clouds be dense, and the storm be imminent; or will the weather be clear, the sun be warm, and the wind be gentle? We sincerely hope that the barometer will always point to "fair", and to achieve this, we are convinced that we must strive to develop trade between our two countries.

Mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States is beneficial to all countries, large and small. The Soviet Union has taken all measures to establish good relations with the United States and its allies

What is still preventing us from achieving mutual understanding and trust?

Strangely, due to the mutual visits of the President of the United States and myself, people have expressed concerns that the Soviet Union is willing to improve Soviet-American relations with some ulterior motives, and is attempting to cause disputes between the United States and its friends and allies. There is no need to discuss this issue in detail, because this is nonsense. We do not intend to instigate anyone to quarrel with others. On the contrary, we have taken all measures to establish good relations not only with the United States but also with its allies. We hope that the meeting between the national leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States will help to further improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and France, and the Soviet Union and other allies of the United States.

For those who are genuinely concerned about improving the international situation, the exchange of views between the Soviet and American governments will not and cannot cause harm. If, as a result of this exchange of views, the Soviet Union and the United States better understand each other and show more forbearance in resolving disputes, this will be beneficial to large and small countries in Europe, Asia, and other continents, and especially to the cause of peace.

We do not pursue a policy of uniting the strong against the weak. We hope to discuss the issue of eliminating the "Cold War" with powerful countries, and also with all countries. This is of equal benefit and interest to all countries.

I have already said that we have come to your country with a frank spirit. We are not here to ask for anything or to impose anything on you. Our goal is to understand your country, to understand the great American people who have made great contributions to human development, to meet with your national activists and social activists and business people, and to have useful conversations on all issues of concern to the people of our two countries and to all mankind.

I hope that American newspapers and magazines, radio stations, and television stations will convey to the American people the friendly sentiments, peace, and happiness wishes expressed by all the Soviet people, myself personally, and the accompanying personnel to all Americans.

Thank you for listening to my speech.

    赫鲁晓夫在美国全国新闻俱乐部发表演说
    苏美两国应合力争取改变国际气候
    苏联准备向联合国提出一项新的裁军建议
    据新华社讯　美国全国新闻俱乐部、全国妇女新闻俱乐部和外国记者协会16日在华盛顿美国全国新闻俱乐部大厅联合举办欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的宴会。这次出席宴会的有代表着三百五十家美国和外国报刊、电台、电视台的四百五十名美国和外国新闻记者。他们还只是希望出席这次宴会的人中的一小部分。由于新闻俱乐部大厅不能容纳下所有希望同赫鲁晓夫会见的人，因此，就在邻近的大厅中为那些没有被邀请出席宴会的新闻记者举行了大型的电视转播。
    美国驻联合国常任代表洛奇、美国副国务卿狄龙、美国驻苏联大使汤普森以及其他官方人士出席了宴会。
    全国新闻俱乐部主任劳伦斯代表宴会的举办者向出席宴会的人介绍赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员，并致以简短的欢迎词。
    新闻记者们以经久不息的掌声欢迎赫鲁晓夫。当尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫开始讲话的时候，新闻记者们全体起立，大厅里再一次地响起了掌声。赫鲁晓夫的讲话通过电台转播到苏联，并通过电视和电台转播到美国各地。
    出席宴会的人十分注意地听取了赫鲁晓夫的讲话。他的话在暴风雨般的掌声中结束。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫回答了记者们提出的问题。
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社华盛顿讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫16日在华盛顿全国新闻俱乐部发表演说，全文如下：主席先生，诸位先生！
    我很高兴能够在访问开始时同美国的著名记者相会。我不止一次有机会体会到，记者们都是非常富于求知欲的人。他们想一下子什么都知道，他们具有非常丰富的想像力。大家向我提出了这样多的问题，如果一一回答的话，我就得在这里呆上半年。怎么样，如果我在这里呆上半年，你们不会反对吧？预先表示谢意。不过我得赶回莫斯科去，在我们国家接待你们尊敬的总统！
    争取改善苏美关系和巩固世界和平是访美之行主要目的
    我在这里同你们谈话，我将尽量满足你们的好奇心，扼要地谈一谈同我访美有关的一些问题。
    我在莫斯科有一次同记者交谈时，曾经称他们是我的旅伴。的确，你们许多人都将是我访问美国各地的旅伴。我很希望你们都是积极的、客观的好旅伴。因为向人们报道我们访美情况的真实新闻在很大程度上取决于你们记者。你们将听到我的谈话和发言，报道我的言论。我要求你们，先生们，尽力正确地理解我的意思，正确地报道我所说的话。如果有时我偶而失言，最好请你们再问我一声，我将很愿意回答你们，因为我不希望让解释不当的话违背我的原意。
    人们常常问我，从我们的访问能够预期什么样的结果。我们昨天才到达美国的首都，要试着预测我们访问的结果，未免为时太早。要知道，气象台要预报第二天的气候都有不少困难，而政治上的预测当然不会更容易些。
    但是，如果根据我们第一天在华盛顿的会见和会谈情况来判断，我可以说，晴雨表上指着：“晴”。
    在我们面前差不多还有两个星期。我们将了解你们的国家，了解人民的生活，将同艾森豪威尔总统就双方感到兴趣的问题进行会谈。我很久没有同你们的总统见面了。他的卓越的才干在苏联很受尊敬。我们之间的接触过去主要是通过大使或以交换信件的方式保持的。显然，这样的接触是不能代替直接交往和开诚布公的交谈的。
    你们当然并不期待我在这里会把我已经跟总统谈过或者打算谈的东西全都说出来。但是，有些东西是必须谈的，否则，你们对苏联在重大国际问题上的立场便不会有正确的了解。
    首先我要强调指出，我们是怀抱着最好的愿望和诚恳的心情来到你们这里的。我们带来了对美国人民的友谊之情，带来了争取改善我们两国关系和巩固世界和平的真诚愿望。这是我们这次访问的主要目的。
    解决裁军问题是使战争成为不可能的最好的和最可靠的途径
    我们想同你们政府磋商极其重大的问题。这些问题是很多的。不过，首先我要提出的是：缓和国际紧张局势和消除“冷战”的问题、裁军问题、对德和约问题、世界贸易问题、改善我们两国关系的问题。
    我认为，总统和我将会把我们的会谈集中在消除“冷战”和巩固和平的问题、缓和国际紧张局势的问题上。
    不久前你们的总统说，应当考虑这样一个问题：军备竞赛和国际关系中的紧张状态可能继续到什么时候，世界是否还没有走到可能发生爆炸的地步。对这些话中所表示的对现存国际局势的不满和忧虑，我们完全有同感。
    如果回顾一下历史，就不难看出，不幸的是，直到现在，人们相互屠杀的战争一直是人类社会经常的现象。尽管人类在不断地沿着进步的道路前进，但是人类每前进一步，战争就带有更大的毁灭性。战争夺去了越来越多的人的生命，战争的火焰蔓延到越来越大的领土上。
    在二十世纪，人类已经经受了两次世界大战，它们造成了比以往任何战争都更大的牺牲。自从人们学会掌握原子能和创造了能够在几分钟内飞越数千公里的火箭，第二次世界大战中所采用的最完善的飞机、战舰和坦克同最新式的作战武器相比，差不多成了玩具一样。在这种情况下，如果听任新的世界大战爆发，那简直是疯狂。
    保证和平和把战争从人类社会的生活中永远排除出去，是各国人民所向往的崇高目标。我们的世纪产生了新的大规模毁灭性手段，但它也使人民理解到必须防止战争和保障和平。强大的和平运动就是为这一崇高目的服务的。我们确信，在我们的时代里战争不是不可避免的。可能而且应当使人摆脱对战争惨祸的恐惧。
    使战争成为不可能的最好和最可靠的途径，就是使所有的国家毫无例外地达到这样一种状况：它们不拥有进行战争的手段，换句话说，就是要解决裁军问题。当然，裁军将会影响各个国家最敏感的利益——它们的安全的利益，并且会涉及任何国家都难以放弃的秘密情报的领域，尤其在国际局势紧张和相互怀疑的情况下更是如此。
    我不能预料到我在后天的联合国大会会议上将谈些什么，不过我可以告诉你们，我准备把主要的注意力放在裁军的问题上。苏联政府将提出一项建议，交联合国组织讨论，我们希望这项建议能够在解决当代最迫切的问题上起重大作用。
    没有对德和约，就会毒化几十个国家的关系；不消除上次大战的残余，就不能提供欧洲持久和平的条件
    还有其他一些迫切的国际问题。苏联认为缔结对德和约具有重大的意义，这对你们来说，当然，不是什么新闻了。如果我们不愿意爆发另一世界大战的话，现在正是应该彻底解决第二次世界大战遗留下来的问题的时候了。
    为什么我们这样坚决主张最终要缔结对德和约呢？这是因为没有和约，就会毒化几十个国家之间的关系。不消除上次大战的残余，就不能提供欧洲有持久和平的条件。不能担保，这些残余不会给新战争的土壤施肥。我非常明白农业中肥料的作用，但是我反对政治中的这种肥料。
    我们深信，这样的情况是不能容忍的：第二次世界大战已经结束十四年了，而对德作战的国家还没有同德国签订和约，从而在西德还保留着占领制度。
    有时可以听到某些美国人这样说：欧洲离我们很远，德国领土上存在着两个德国，其中有一个甚至是美国的盟国，大家知道，多一个盟国是不碍事的。据说没有和约也过得下去。
    请原谅我说一句：只有轻率的人才会说这样的话。请大家想一想，在一代人的生命中，你们国家曾经有两次不得不派自己的儿子到欧洲战场上去同德国作战。如果你们现在的盟国西德挑起第三次大战，那会发生什么事情呢？在现在的条件下，已经不会只是派美国的儿女到远离美国海岸的战场上去的问题了。到那时，任何一个参战国的领土都会变成战场。现代的毁灭手段会使战争在一霎那间燃遍整个世界。
    各位一定了解，我们之所以提到不签订对德和约所包含的危险，完全不是因为我们对德国军国主义者有什么害怕。我们有足够的力量去约束复仇主义者，如果有必要的话，并且能够使他们清醒清醒。可是，各位会同意，不能无视这样一个事实：西德某些人士正在策划使苏联同其他国家冲突，加剧它们之间的关系，使世界处于紧张局势下。大家知道，欧洲和德国的战后发展导致了两个德国的建立。不管我们的愿望和我们对它们的态度如何，这两个国家存在着，我们应当考虑这一点。最正确的政策是现实的政策。出路只有一条：同意存在着两个德国，也就是承认在德国问题上的现状，然而不再拖延消灭战争残迹和同两个德国缔结和约。
    如果仅仅容许一种可能——只同统一的德国缔结和约（这当然最好），那么这实际上意味着取消关于和约的问题。
    随着和约的缔结，也就会彻底解决像柏林问题这样一个引起各国经常磨擦的问题。有时听到这样一种说法，似乎柏林问题一年前并不存在，柏林的状况本来不坏。但是，难道必须要等柏林的某个乍看起来不大的风波导致大炮轰鸣么？我们主张事前采取预防冲突的措施。
    无论苏联还是德意志民主共和国，对西柏林都没有任何不可告人的动机和秘密的意图。任何人也不强求把西柏林并入德意志民主共和国，同样也不强求改变那里现存的社会制度和经济制度。
    上月末在美国和德意志联邦共和国政府首脑谈判以后发表的公报中说，艾森豪威尔总统重申“美国和它的盟国保护柏林居民自由和幸福的诺言”。好啊，这个提法也符合我们的愿望。苏联声明过，在现在条件下，最明智的是宣布西柏林为自由城市。我们过去和现在都建议用国际实践中最可靠的保障办法，在联合国参加下或者不在联合国参加下来保证西柏林的独立存在。这会保证西柏林居民的自由和幸福。
    在日内瓦外长会议上，西方三国和苏联的立场有了某些接近，大家更多地了解了双方的意图和立场，我们认为这是一个好的征兆。但是还有某些悬而未决的问题必须进行协商。如果我说，在即将进行的会谈中不会涉及这些问题，你们无论如何是不会相信的。
    关于怎样生活、遵奉什么样的思想体系和观点的问题，应当由各国人民自己解决，不应受到外来干涉
    我们知道，美国人是爱好自由的人民，他们像过去一样准备捍卫自己的信念，捍卫能按照自己认为适宜的方式过生活的权利。苏联人民也珍视这种感情。如果你说你自己有这种权利，你也不能不让别人享有这种权利，不管你对谁的国家制度和社会制度更好这一点抱有任何看法。关于怎样生活、遵奉什么样的思想体系和观点的问题，应当由人民自己来解决，不应当受到外来干涉。
    苏联主张根据和平共处的原则发展国家之间的关系。这些原则是苏维埃国家伟大的奠基人——弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁给我们的遗训。我们是忠实于这些原则的。我们认为，世界观的不同不应当损害国家之间的关系。在世界各国之间应当建立紧密的经济和文化联系。这有助于各国人民和国家领导人彼此更深刻地了解和更好地谅解。这将促进确立相互信任与和平共处。
    苏联和美国面临着这样的扶择：或者是把科学和技术方面的最新成就——揭开原子奥秘、制造火箭、探索宇宙——用来服务于和平的未来和人类的繁荣；或者是把这些成就用于破坏和毁灭的目的，从而使地球布满坟墓和灰烬。
    苏联人民早就做了有利于和平的选择。
    在苏联建立了世界上第一座原子能发电站，这个发电站已经为和平的目的工作五年了；苏联向宇宙发射了世界上第一批人造地球卫星和第一个人造行星，这个行星是用人的天才制造并发射到太空中去的！难道这些事实不令人信服地说明了这一点吗？
    苏联科学家、工程师、技术员和工人在世界上首先创造和实现由地球向另一个天体——月球的宇宙飞行，难道这个辉煌的成就不说明这一点吗？把一个带有科学和测量仪器以及刻有苏联国徽的标记的巨大容器送到了月球表面；苏联人的这一和平功勋大大地扩大了人的认识界限，它表明，如果人类把全部精力用于和平事业，用来达到和平目的，他们将达到多么辉煌的高峰。
    在我们启程来美国前，强大的“列宁号”原子破冰船已经启航。它将很快地冲破北冰洋的冰层，为装载最和平的货物供应和平人民的船只开辟道路。
    我们相信，美国人民也主张和平。但是，如果我们的利益在保证和平这个最重要的问题上是吻合的，那么，我们必须步调一致，联合我们的力量和精力，争取大力改变国际气候。因此，让我们来想一想，我们该如何实现苏美合作。
    至于苏联，它愿意考虑任何有助于搞好苏美睦邻关系的建议。可以理解，必须双方都作出努力，或者像你们喜欢说的那样，必须各走一半道路，互相靠拢。
    当然，不可能一下子就做到这一点。如果以为哪天早晨醒来，我们就会看到，所有争端都解决了，所有分歧都消除了，那就太天真了。“冷战”所产生的误解和成见积累得太多了。但是，苏联政府相信，如果我们共同顽强地努力，那么，完全有可能驱散我们两国关系中的乌云。
    请比较一下今天的国际局势同过去，譬如说，五、六年以前的局势。现在出现了缓和“冷战”的某些迹象。必须促使“冷战”尽快地消失。报界（人们把报纸也称作“大国”，看来这并不是没有原因的）的人士可以为这个目标的实现做很多事情。
    苏联人高兴的是，最近，苏美关系中出现了好转。我指的是国家领导人的直接接触有了发展，例如，米高扬和科兹洛夫访问美国以及尼克松副总统访问苏联。在纽约举办苏联展览会和在莫斯科举办美国展览会，是件大事。我很高兴地同尼克松先生一道参观了你们的展览会。我在那里曾经同他作了热烈而有益的交谈。
    我们还准备尽一切力量来发展世界贸易。应该消除已经破产了的贸易歧视政策，从而澄清国与国关系中的气氛。
    例如，难道可以认为苏美目前的贸易额是正常的吗？要知道，我们两国一年来互换的所有商品只能装满两艘轮船。但是，我们两国却占世界工业生产的半数以上。试问，贸易歧视政策达到了什么目的，它是为什么服务的？如果理智地来看待事物，那么，这个政策只是服务于一个目的——维持我们两国关系中的不信任。
    贸易是一个晴雨表；它指明政策朝哪一个方向发展：将乌云密布，风雨欲来呢；还是将天气晴朗，日暖风和呢。我们诚恳地希望，晴雨表经常指在“晴”上，而要作到这一点，我们深信必须竭力发展我们两国的贸易。
    苏美两国相互了解对所有大国和小国都有好处。苏联采取了一切措施同美国及其盟国建立良好关系
    有什么东西还在妨碍我们取得互相谅解和信任呢？
    奇怪的是，由于美国总统和我进行互相访问，竟然听到有人表示这样的担心：说苏联愿意使苏美关系健康化，是抱有什么居心叵测的盘算，是企图使美国同它的朋友、同它的盟国发生争吵。无需详细谈论这个问题，因为这是无稽之谈。我们不打算唆使任何人同别人吵架。相反，我们采取了一切措施来不仅同美国，并且同它的盟国建立良好的关系。我们希望，苏美两国国家领导人的会晤会有助于进一步改善苏英、苏法以及苏联同美国其他盟国之间的关系。
    对于那些真正关心使国际局势健康化的人来说，苏美两国政府交换意见，不会也不可能带来害处。如果由于这种交换意见的结果，苏联和美国更好地相互了解，在解决争执问题上表现出更多的忍让精神，这对于欧亚和其他大洲上的大国和小国，特别是对和平事业，都有好处。
    我们不实行那种联合强者反对弱者的政策。我们希望同强国，也希望同所有的国家商讨消除“冷战”问题。这对于所有的国家都有同样的好处和同样的利益。
    我已经说过，我们是带着坦率的精神来到你们国家的。我们到这里，不是为了请求什么或者把什么强加给你们。我们的目的是了解你们的国家，了解对人类发展作出过巨大贡献的伟大的美国人民，同你们的国家活动家和社会活动家以及商界人士会见，就我们两国人民和全人类所关心的一切问题进行有益的谈话。
    希望美国的报纸和杂志、电台和电视台，把全体苏联人民、我个人和随行人员对全体美国人表示的友好情谊、和平和幸福的祝愿转达美国人民。
    谢谢你们来听我的演说。
