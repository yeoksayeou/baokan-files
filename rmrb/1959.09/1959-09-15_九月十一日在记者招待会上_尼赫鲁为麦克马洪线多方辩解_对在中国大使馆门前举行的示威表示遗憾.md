Xinhua News Agency, 14th: According to the Indian Information Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru answered questions from journalists on issues such as the Sino-Indian border at a press conference on the 11th.

Nehru said: "When I used certain serious words to talk about (Premier Zhou Enlai's) letter, it was not because I anticipated some amazing development soon or even later, but because the letter showed that the attitude had become somewhat tough. When any country insists on its position in a dispute, it is always a serious matter. At that time, how to change the attitude of insistence or abandon one's original position becomes a matter of prestige. In this sense, I said it was a serious problem. But I had no expectation whatsoever that there would be any sudden event that could lead to any kind of conflict, even a small one.”

A reporter asked him if he would change his plans to visit Afghanistan and Iran because of this letter and the serious situation. He said, "I will definitely go to Kabul and Tehran within three days. What does this have to do with that matter? This is taking a strangely alarmed view."

A reporter asked: "In your speech in the Council of States yesterday, you said that Zhou repeated three times during his meeting with you in 1956 that he accepted the McMahon Line; you also said that you didn't fully trust your memory, so you wrote these things down. Did you exchange these records with Zhou?"

Nehru said: Not at that time, "Long after, I did send him a summary of the records. This summary was published in the White Paper. At that time, I did not send it to him.”

He added: Zhou Enlai did not confirm the records of these talks.

When talking about Premier Zhou Enlai mentioning in his letter that the Tibetan local government sent a telegram to the Indian government in 1947 requesting the return of the area south of the so-called "McMahon Line," Nehru said: "I haven't seen it (the telegram) recently, but I vaguely remember this matter. When we were studying Zhou's letters, we tried to find out about these issues, but I vaguely remember that when we became independent, we received such a telegram. As far as I can remember, in any case, the impression I got was: this wasn't about any major change there, but about some small areas on the border where there were disputes. There had been disputes before, but I don't want to answer it because I haven't checked it again. This is an old impression, and at that time, we were busy with independence and overall changes.”

Nehru said that the Indian government has clearly demarcated maps of the so-called "McMahon Line." He said that above it, there are "explanatory notes by McMahon and others who worked with him, mentioning some specific clauses, which state whether this place is on this side of the line or on that side of the line. You know, the general practice, I think, is to reach the watershed and take it as the dividing line - water flows to India and also to China. In one or two places - I forget the names - for some practical reasons, it was suggested to make some small changes. For example, there is a Buddhist temple slightly on the Indian side, but the Tibetans cherish it very much, so it was placed on the Tibetan side. I don't think this was decided by McMahon, it was agreed later.”

A reporter asked: "Could you please talk about the exact situation of the Chinese-Tibetan border before the 1914 treaty was signed? Did the McMahon Line generally determine the traditional border?" He said: "The intention was to determine some kind of border, but it was not strictly delineated or marked. You know, most of this is in uninhabited areas. There may be some people who occasionally live in very small villages somewhere, but generally speaking, no one lives there, or if someone uses it, they use it for grazing in the summer and withdraw from the area in the winter. So, there was no pressing need for Tibetans or anyone on this side to clearly demarcate this border. But I cannot answer your question very accurately.”

Regarding the issue of Longju, Nehru said, "As far as we know, Longju is on this side of the border, and that's how it's drawn on our maps. This is the actual situation." When talking about solutions to this problem, Nehru said, "We hope to avoid showing force to insist on this or that, because taking one action will lead to a reaction. It was in Longju that Chinese troops and Indian troops first exchanged fire.”

Nehru responded to the issue of submitting the Tibet issue to the United Nations, reiterating that he did not think this could be done because it "would not lead to any positive results." A reporter asked what attitude India would take if a country raised the Tibet issue in the United Nations. Nehru said, "Our view on this matter may depend on what is raised and in what way it is raised.” In response to a reporter's question about whether there was anything that "outsiders" could do regarding Tibet and what could be done from the "outside," Nehru said, "I don't know if outsiders - an individual, group, or country - can do anything. It is difficult to answer this question. The world is full of regrettable things, and as an individual, people may be able to do something about these things. I can say that, in any case, one can take the form of protesting and expressing disagreement, etc.” He said that regarding the issue of Sino-Indian relations, "I don't think - I have said to you - that anything big will happen in the foreseeable future, because I cannot imagine anything more foolish than either of our two countries encouraging or allowing anything to happen. Nevertheless, the seriousness of the situation does not lie in some border dispute, not in the question of one mile on this side or one mile on that side, but in the growing estrangement, annoyance, and sometimes angry emotions on both sides. This is not a good thing. We have been trying to avoid this not only with China but with any country in the world.” He added: “War may not happen, but I would implore you—I am not asking you to treat this matter lightly, because this matter is serious—to help prevent people from getting agitated. It is very easy for people to get agitated; this is very easy. Precisely for this reason, I regret the demonstrations of some form held in front of the Chinese Embassy in Delhi and other places.”

Nehru also answered questions raised by reporters regarding whether the "Security Council-appointed committee on Laos violated the 1954 Geneva Accords." He said, "I don't know about violations of the agreement, but this completely bypasses the agreement." He said, "Trouble will arise once the methods stipulated by the Geneva Accords are undermined or ended, because that method itself was used to stop or prevent trouble from happening. For five years, it has been an effective way to prevent trouble from happening. Therefore, in our opinion, canceling that method is a dangerous thing.” “We have always believed that these international committees arose from a common understanding of the situation in Indochina.” He also said: "I cannot say what kind of consequences this new step taken by the Security Council might have, or how all of this will play out; but any real success can only be achieved through agreement by all parties." Nehru also answered some questions about Indo-Pakistani relations and India's internal affairs.

    九月十一日在记者招待会上
    尼赫鲁为麦克马洪线多方辩解
    对在中国大使馆门前举行的示威表示遗憾
    新华社14日讯  据印度新闻处报道：印度总理尼赫鲁11日在记者招待会上答复了新闻记者提出的关于中印边界等方面的问题。
    尼赫鲁说：“当我用某些严重的字眼谈到（周恩来总理）那封信的时候，那并不是因为我预期很快或者甚至在以后会有某种惊人的发展，而是因为那封信表明态度已经变得有些强硬。当任何一个国家在争执中坚持它的立场的时候，那总是一件严重的事情。那时，如何改变坚持的态度或者放弃自己原来的立场，就成了一个威望的问题。在这种意义上，我说这是一个严重的问题。但是我完全没有预期，会有任何可能导致任何种类的冲突、哪怕是小冲突的突然事件。”
    有记者问他，他会不会因为这封信和严重的形势而改变到阿富汗和伊朗去访问的计划。他说，“我肯定将在三天以内去喀布尔和德黑兰，这和那件事有什么关系呢？这是采取一种奇特的大惊小怪的看法。”
    有记者问：“昨天你在联邦院的讲话中说，周在1956年和你会谈的过程中，曾经三次重复说，他接受麦克马洪线；你并且说，你不完全相信你的记忆力，因而把这些事情记下来。你有没有和周交换过这些记录？”
    尼赫鲁说：当时没有，“很久以后，我的确把记录摘要寄给他了。白皮书上发表了这个摘要。在当时，我没有寄给他。”
    他又说：周恩来没有确认这些会谈的记录。
    谈到周恩来总理在他的信中提到，西藏地方政府在1947年打电报给印度政府，要求归还所谓的“麦克马洪线”以南的地区这件事时，尼赫鲁说：“我最近没有看到它（电报），可是我模糊地记得这件事。我们在研究周的信件时，试图查明这些问题，可是我模糊地记得，当我们独立时，我们是接到过这种电报的。就我记忆所及，不管怎么样，我所得到的印象是：这不是关于那里的任何大的改变，而是关于在边界上某些存在争端的小地区。以前有过争端，可是我不想答复它，因为我还没有再查阅它。这是旧的印象，当时我们正忙于独立和全面改变。”
    尼赫鲁说，印度政府有明确地划有所谓“麦克马洪线”的地图。他说，上面“有麦克马洪和同他一起工作的其他人的解释性注解，提到一些具体条款，它们说明这个地方是在线的这一边还是在线的那一边。你们知道，总的作法，我想，是到达分水岭，并把它作为分界线——水流向印度，也流向中国。在一两个地方——我忘记名字了——由于某些实际的原因，曾经建议作某些小的改变。例如，有一个佛寺稍许偏在印度这一边，但是西藏人非常珍视它，因此就把它放在西藏这一边。我想这不是麦克马洪决定的，这是后来才商定的。”
    有记者问：“能不能请你谈一下在1914年条约签订之前中国—西藏边界的确切情况？麦克马洪线总的来说是否确定了传统的边界？”他说：“意图是要确定某种边界，可是没有严格地划定或标出。你们知道，这大部分是在无人居住的地区，可能有一些人偶然住在某个地方的很小的村庄里，可是总的说来，没有人住在那里，或者，如果有人利用它的话，他们也是在夏天用它来放牧，而在冬天退出那个地区，所以，西藏人或这边任何人都没有确切地划定这个边界的迫切需要。可是我无法非常确切地回答你的问题。”
    关于朗久的问题，尼赫鲁说，“据我们所知，朗久就在边界这边，在我们的地图上是这样画的，这是实际情况。”谈到解决这个问题的办法时，尼赫鲁说，“我们希望避免显示武力来硬要这样或那样，因为采取一种行动就会有反行动。是在朗久，中国部队和印度部队第一次发生了开火事件。”
    尼赫鲁答复了把西藏问题提交联合国的问题，他重申他认为不能这样做，是因为这“不可能导致任何积极的结果。”有记者问，如果有某个国家在联合国中提出西藏问题，印度将采取什么样的态度。尼赫鲁说：“我们对这事的看法可能取决于提出什么，以什么方式提出。”在答复记者提出的对于西藏有没有“局外人”能够做的事情和能够从“外界”做的事情的问题时，尼赫鲁说，“我不知道局外人——一个个人、团体、或者国家——是否能做什么事情。很难回答这个问题。这个世界充满了令人遗憾的事，作为一个个人，人们也许可以对这些事情有所作为，我可以说，无论如何可以采取提出抗议和表示不同意等等的形式。”他说，关于中印关系问题，“我不认为——我曾对你们说过——在可以预见的将来将发生什么大的事情，因为我不能设想还有什么比我们两国之中任何一国鼓励发生任何事情或允许发生任何事情更为愚蠢的事情。虽然如此，局势的严重性并不在于某种边境纠纷，不是这边一英里还是那边一英里的问题，而是双方日益增长的疏远、懊恼、有时是愤怒的情绪。这是不好的事情。我们不仅对中国而且对世界任何一国都一直在努力避免这种事情。”他又说：“战争可能不会发生，但我要恳求你们——我并不是要你们等闲对待这个问题，因为这件事情很严重——帮助防止人们激动起来，人们是很容易激动起来的，这是十分容易的，正因为这一点，我对在德里和其他地方的中国大使馆门前举行的某种形式的示威感到遗憾。”
    尼赫鲁还答复了记者提出的“安全理事会任命的关于老挝的委员会是否违反1954年日内瓦协议”的问题，他说：“我不知道关于违反协议的事情，但是这完全绕过了这个协议。”他说：“日内瓦协议规定的办法一旦破坏，或者结束，麻烦就会产生，因为那个办法本身就是用来制止或防止发生麻烦的。五年来，它一直是制止发生麻烦的有效办法。因此，在我们看来，取消那个办法是件危险的事情。”“我们一贯认为这些国际委员会是由于对印度支那局势有一个共同的了解而产生的。”他又说：“我无法说安全理事会采取的这个新步骤可能会有什么样的后果，这一切到底将如何发挥作用；但是任何真正的成功只有通过各方达成协议才能取得。”尼赫鲁还答复了关于印巴关系和印度内政方面一些问题。
