Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: Inspired by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, commercial front workers in various regions have launched a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, centering on doing a good job in purchasing and sales. They are actively expanding the procurement of industrial and agricultural products, promoting production development, rationally allocating commodities, and ensuring market supply to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Many provinces and cities have recently launched a concentrated campaign to purchase industrial and agricultural products, greatly increasing the amount of purchases. The Wuhan Municipal First Commercial Bureau and its affiliated companies are, on the one hand, actively helping relevant factories in the city to overcome difficulties in technology, raw materials, and materials to promote increased production; on the other hand, they are sending people to other places to expand purchasing and sales relationships and organize sources of goods. The intake of goods and the variety of commodities such as department stores, cultural supplies, hardware, and medicine have increased significantly. Jilin Province organized 200,000 people to enter the Changbai Mountains and 150,000 people to enter the western grasslands to collect local and special products. Since September, the average daily purchase amount of agricultural and sideline local and special products in the province has increased by more than double compared with August. The third quarter's purchase plan for live sheep and grass bags has been overfulfilled ahead of schedule. The amount of agricultural and sideline product purchases in Fujian Province increased significantly in August, and further increased in early September. The seven counties in the Minhou Special District have already completed the procurement and transfer plans for major non-staple foods for August and September ahead of schedule. Commercial departments in Jiangxi Province organized an army of 100,000 people, on the one hand, going up the mountains and down to the countryside to collect local and special products, and on the other hand, purchasing locally, making the amount of local and special products and waste materials collected doubled. A large number of raw materials and waste materials have supported the production of light industry and handicraft departments.

Employees responsible for supply work are doing everything possible to expand the variety of commodities, improve service quality, and do a good job in supply work. In Shandong, many salespersons responsible for the supply of production materials have implemented "three guarantees and four deliveries to the fields": guaranteeing supply, installation, and repair; inspection, delivery, repair, and technical instruction to the fields. The number of salespersons in Pingyuan County going to the countryside to deliver goods has increased from 1,200 to more than 1,600. They proposed: "Not afraid of the sun, not afraid of heavy rain, not afraid of long distances, following the sun and moon", and supplied more than 40,000 pieces of irrigation and drainage tools and agricultural tools, and 220,000 catties of fertilizer in two days. Wang Zhendong, an advanced salesperson who has maintained his position at the Hubin Store in Boxing County for five consecutive years, was particularly excited after seeing the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. He carried a peddler's load, one end filled with daily necessities and the other end filled with production materials, and braved wind and rain to deliver goods to the countryside 22 times in seven days and seven nights.

The sales shops and service industries in the cities are also presenting a myriad of new scenes. The Dashizi Department Store in Guiyang City has the highest average sales volume per salesperson among the large stores in the country. The employees of this store recently initiated a friendly competition among 29 large and medium-sized department stores across the country. Their conditions are: the commodity circulation cost level from September to December should be reduced to below 1.8%; the turnover of working capital should be once every 30 days; and the sales error rate should be controlled below 0.025%. All employees of the store are striving to achieve this initiative. Employees in the retail, catering, and service industries in Chongqing City are also carrying out a competition to welcome the National Day. Many shops and vegetable markets on the four main streets centered on the most bustling Liberation Monument have been decorated anew; department stores, cultural supplies, medicine, cotton cloth and other stores have added more than 2,200 new varieties of commodities. The employees of the largest "March 8th" Department Store have added 17 service items and done more than 500 good deeds for customers in a week, receiving praise and thanks from customers.

    商业战线气象万千
    扩大产品收购做好市场供应
    据新华社16日讯　各地商业战线职工在党的八届八中全会号召的鼓舞下，掀起了以做好购销工作为中心的增产节约新高潮，积极扩大工农业产品的收购，促进生产发展，合理调拨商品，做好市场供应，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    许多省、市最近开展了采购工农业产品的突击运动，使采购额大大增加。武汉市第一商业局所属各公司一方面积极帮助本市各有关工厂克服技术、原料、材料等方面的困难，促使增加生产；一方面派人到外地扩大购销关系，组织货源。百货、文化用品、五金、医药等商品的进货量和商品品种都大大增加。吉林省组织了二十万人进长白山区，十五万人进西部草原，采集土特产品。从9月份以来，全省农副土特产品的日采购额平均比8月份增加了一倍以上，活羊和草袋子第三季度的收购计划已经超额完成。福建省农副产品的收购量在8月份大有增加的基础上，9月上旬又有增长。闽候专区的七个县已经提前完成8、9月份的主要副食品采购和上调计划。江西省商业部门组织十万大军，一面上山下乡采集土特产品，一面就地收购，使土特产品和废品废料的收购量成倍上升，大批原料和废品废料已经支援了轻工业和手工业部门的生产。
    担负供应工作的职工千方百计扩大商品品种，提高服务质量，做好供应工作。山东许多负责生产资料供应工作的售货员实行了三包四到田：包供应、安装、修配；检查、送货、修配、技术传授到田。平原县下乡送货的售货员由一千二百人增加到一千六百多人，他们提出：“不怕太阳晒，不怕暴雨淋，不怕路途远，跟着太阳月亮转”，在两天内就供应了排灌工具、农具四万多件，肥料二十二万斤。博兴县湖滨商店连续五年保持先进的售货员王振东，看到党的八届八中全会公报和决议后特别兴奋，他挑着货郎担，一头装满日用百货，一头装满生产资料，七天七夜中冒风顶雨下乡送货二十二次。
    城市中的售货商店和服务行业也是气象万千。贵阳市大十字百货商店是全国大型商店中营业员平均销售额最高的，这个商店职工最近向全国二十九个大中型百货商店倡议发起友谊竞赛。他们的条件是：9至12月商品流通费用水平降低到1.8％以下；流动资金三十天周转一次；销货差错率控制在万分之二点五以下。全店职工正为实现这个倡议而奋斗。重庆市零售、饮食、服务行业的职工也开展了迎接国庆的竞赛活动，以最热闹的解放碑为中心的四条主要街道上，许多商店、菜市场已经粉饰布置一新；百货、文化用品、医药、棉布等商店，增加了二千二百多种新花色品种的商品。最大的“三八”百货商店的职工增设了十七个服务项目，一周内为顾客办了五百多件好事，受到顾客的表扬感谢。
