Comrade Chairman, dear comrades, friends:

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and the government and people of the German Democratic Republic, and on behalf of all patriotic and peace-loving forces of the German people, I extend to you and the heroic and fraternal Chinese people our most heartfelt congratulations and fraternal fighting salute.

    The great historical victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China ten years ago opened a new stage in the history of the Chinese people, namely, the stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The fraternal Chinese people faced difficulties at the beginning of 1949. Because the Chinese people had suffered from feudal and colonial oppression, as well as the rule of the anti-people Chiang Kai-shek regime, they inherited a very bad legacy: economic disintegration, hunger, poverty and unemployment, unimaginable backwardness, the worst sanitary conditions, and many other ills. However, the heroic fraternal Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, after successfully and sacrificially solving the military tasks of the people's revolution, without delay, victoriously set about solving the tasks of peaceful socialist construction.

    When American imperialism launched a bloody war of aggression against the fraternal Korean people in 1950 and severely threatened the People's Republic of China and its construction, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the heroes of the Korean People's Army, stood shoulder to shoulder to defend their motherland and recorded one victory after another on their banners. In this way, on the front of peaceful construction and socialist transformation in urban and rural areas, on the front of political and ideological struggle, and in the continuous struggle against the imperialist aggressors with arms, the Chinese people have achieved and defended those achievements that amazed the world during the period of economic recovery, the period of the first five-year plan, and the second five-year plan. At the same time, the people of all countries in the great socialist camp are united with the fraternal Chinese people, and they regard the victory of the fraternal Chinese people as their own achievement and as an important contribution to strengthening the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Other peace-loving people in other countries are also happy about the great construction achievements of the People's Republic of China. Especially for the non-socialist countries in Asia and Africa, the People's Republic of China has become an increasingly significant example. Only the imperialist forces are annoyed by this, because if the founding of the People's Republic of China was already a heavy blow to colonial rule, now this influence is greatly strengthened.

    Here, I would only like to point out the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its chairman, Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people, which is still continuing this year. These achievements have greatly accelerated the pace of socialist construction. Here, it should also be pointed out the significance of the establishment of people's communes, which is an important prerequisite for accelerating the pace of socialist construction under the specific conditions of the People's Republic of China. Although the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party only closed a few weeks ago, it can now be affirmed that the Chinese people will complete the new great tasks put forward by the Plenary Session with their inherent revolutionary vigor and labor enthusiasm. The many new achievements made in all aspects of socialist construction have clearly demonstrated this.

    All these achievements in socialist construction are a testament to the brilliant application of Marxism-Leninism by the Chinese Communist Party and its chairman, Comrade Mao Zedong, under the specific historical conditions of China.

    These achievements have also made the People's Republic of China today a first-class power that can resolutely and successfully crush all conspiracies of imperialism, especially American imperialism. In this regard, the People's Republic of China receives the fraternal and full support of all socialist brother countries and the sympathy of peace-loving forces around the world.

    These achievements and the foreign policy established by the People's Republic of China in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence for the maintenance of world peace have given the People's Republic of China a lofty reputation and great prestige in the international community today.

    There is a close and unbreakable friendship between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China. This relationship is a direct continuation of the traditional close relationship between the revolutionary workers' movements of our two countries. Our two countries were founded in the same year and month. Since then, the two countries have been supporting and assisting each other in socialist construction in the spirit of socialist internationalism.

    Please allow me to take this opportunity, on behalf of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and the Government and people of the German Democratic Republic, to express our sincere and deep gratitude to you and all the Chinese people for your selfless assistance to the German Democratic Republic and its people in their struggle to build socialism and strive for the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany.

    At the same time, I can assure the fraternal Chinese people that the German Democratic Republic and its people will continue to do their utmost to support the Chinese people in their struggle to build socialism and oppose all imperialist conspiracies. Similarly, the German Democratic Republic, as a peaceful fortress on the western front of the socialist camp in Europe, will continue to firmly and unswervingly fulfill its historical mission in the future. The continued victorious construction of socialism in the German Democratic Republic will be of decisive significance for maintaining peace in Europe and will also create favorable prerequisites for a peaceful and democratic solution to the German question. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has pointed out the way to achieve this goal. The realization of this great and responsible task will give us confidence and provide us with the guarantee that the German imperialism and militarism that have been revived in West Germany will not be able to realize their atomic war plans.

    The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has made it clear to the world public that there is only one Germany. The first worker-peasant state in German history, the German Democratic Republic, consistently pursues a policy of peace and understanding, while the Bonn state of militarists and revanchists poses a grave threat to world peace.

    If the West German militarist and revanchist forces think they can launch a third world war, they are miscalculating. 1959 is not 1939. Today, the forces of peace and progress are strong enough to deter those incorrigible warmongers from acting rashly.

    Dear comrades, friends! No matter where peace is attacked from, peace can and will be maintained. The consolidated and unshakable unity of the socialist camp led by the great Soviet Union and the concerted efforts of the world's peace forces are the most reliable guarantee.

    Long live the great and powerful People's Republic of China!

    Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong!

    Long live the unbreakable Sino-German friendship!

    Long live the invincible socialist camp led by the Soviet Union!

    Long live understanding among the people of all countries and world peace!

### 德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员、德意志民主共和国  人民议院主席团第一副主席、德意志民主共和国党政代表团团长  赫·马特恩同志的贺词

    德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员、德意志民主共和国
    人民议院主席团第一副主席、德意志民主共和国党政代表团团长
    赫·马特恩同志的贺词敬爱的主席同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    在中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，我代表德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克同志、德国统一社会党中央委员会、德意志民主共和国政府和人民，代表全体德意志人民爱国的、爱好和平的力量，向你们和英勇的、兄弟的全体中国人民致以最衷心的祝贺和兄弟般的战斗敬礼。
    中国人民革命的伟大的历史性胜利和十年前中华人民共和国的成立，在中国人民的历史上开辟了一个新的阶段，即社会主义革命和社会主义建设的阶段。兄弟的中国人民在1949年开始时是面临着困难的。由于中国人民遭受过封建和殖民压迫，以及与人民为敌的蒋介石政权的统治，因此承受了一份很坏的遗产：经济的解体、饥饿、贫困和失业，难以想像的落后，最恶劣的卫生状况以及其他许多弊端。但是，英勇的兄弟的中国人民在共产党的领导下，在成功地、富有牺牲精神地解决了人民革命的军事任务以后，就毫不迟延地、胜利地着手解决和平建设社会主义的任务。
    当1950年美国帝国主义开始对兄弟的朝鲜人民发动血腥的侵略战争，并且极其严重地威胁中华人民共和国及其建设事业的时候，中国人民志愿军就同朝鲜人民军的英雄们一起，肩并肩地起来保卫祖国，并且在他们的旗帜上记载下一次又一次的胜利。就这样，在和平建设和城乡社会主义改造的战线上，在政治思想战线上，在拿起武器对帝国主义侵略者进行的不断斗争中，中国人民取得了并且保卫了经济恢复时期、第一个五年计划时期和第二个五年计划时期的那些使全世界惊讶的成就。同时，伟大的社会主义阵营各国人民同兄弟的中国人民团结在一起，他们把兄弟的中国人民的胜利看作自己的成就，看作是加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的重要贡献。其他国家爱好和平的人民也为中华人民共和国的伟大建设成就感到高兴。特别是对于亚洲和非洲的非社会主义国家，中华人民共和国已经日益显著地成为一个榜样。唯有帝国主义势力对此感到恼怒，因为如果说中华人民共和国的成立对殖民主义统治就已经是一次沉重的打击，而现在这种影响更是大大地加强了。
    在这里，我只想指出中国人民在光荣的中国共产党及其主席——中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下在1958年大跃进中所取得的巨大成就，这种大跃进今年还在继续。这些成就大大地加快了社会主义建设的速度。在这里应该同时指出成立人民公社的意义，人民公社是在中华人民共和国的具体条件下加快社会主义建设速度的一个重要前提。虽然中国共产党的八届八中全会闭幕才几个星期，但是现在已经可以肯定，中国人民将以自己固有的革命干劲和劳动热情完成全会所提出的新的伟大任务。在社会主义建设的各方面所取得的许多新的成就，已经明显地证明了这一点。
    所有这些社会主义建设的成就都是中国共产党及其主席毛泽东同志在中国的具体历史条件下创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的光辉的见证。
    这些成就也使得中华人民共和国今天成为一个第一流的大国，这个国家能够坚决地和成功地粉碎帝国主义，特别是美国帝国主义的一切阴谋。在这方面，中华人民共和国得到所有社会主义兄弟国家兄弟般的充分支持以及全世界爱好和平力量的同情。
    这些成就和中华人民共和国为了维护世界和平而根据和平共处五项原则所确立的外交政策，使得中华人民共和国今天在国际上享有崇高的声誉和巨大的威信。
    德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间有着紧密的、牢不可破的友谊关系。这种关系是我们两国革命工人运动之间传统的紧密关系的直接继续。我们两国是在同年同月成立的。从那时以来，两国就本着社会主义的国际主义精神，在社会主义建设中相互给予支持和援助。
    请允许我利用这个机会，代表德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克同志、德国统一社会党中央委员会以及德意志民主共和国政府和人民，向你们和全体中国人民表示诚挚的、深切的谢意，感谢你们对德意志民主共和国及其人民建设社会主义和争取和平民主地重新统一德国的斗争所给予的无私援助。
    同时，我可以向兄弟的中国人民保证，德意志民主共和国及其人民今后仍将用全力支持中国人民建设社会主义和反对一切帝国主义阴谋的斗争。同样的，德意志民主共和国作为社会主义阵营在欧洲的西方战线上的和平堡垒，今后将继续坚定地、毫不动摇地完成它的历史任务。德意志民主共和国继续胜利地建设社会主义，将对维护欧洲和平具有决定性的意义，同时也将为和平民主地解决德国问题创造有利的前提。德国统一社会党的第六届中央全会已经指出了达到这个目的的道路。实现这个伟大而责任重大的任务，将使我们有信心，并给我们提供了保证使西德重新复活的德国帝国主义和军国主义无法实现它们的原子战争计划。
    日内瓦外长会议已经向全世界公众明显地表明，只有一个德国。德国人民历史上的第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国是始终一贯地执行和平和谅解的政策，而军国主义分子和复仇主义分子的波恩国家却极其严重地威胁着世界和平。
    如果西德军国主义和复仇主义势力以为可以发动第三次世界大战，那么，他们就打错了算盘。1959年已经不是1939年了。今天，和平和进步的力量已经强大得足以使那些不可救药的战争纵火者不敢轻举妄动。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！不管和平受到来自何方的进攻，和平都能够，并且必将得到维护。由伟大的苏联领导的社会主义阵营巩固的、不可动摇的团结和全世界和平力量的一致努力，就是最可靠的保证。
    伟大的强盛的中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛泽东同志领导下的光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    牢不可破的德中友谊万岁！
    苏联领导下的不可战胜的社会主义阵营万岁！
    各国人民之间的谅解和世界和平万岁！（附图片）
