Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. Chinese Party and State Leaders today sent telegrams to Vietnamese Party and State Leaders, congratulating them on the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Comrade Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, Comrade Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:

On the occasion of the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, extend our warm congratulations to the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people.

Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the hardworking Vietnamese people have achieved great success in socialist transformation and socialist construction. In recent years, the rapid improvement of industrial and agricultural production and the vigorous development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, especially the comprehensive victory in economic development in the first half of this year, have created favorable conditions for the Vietnamese people to further establish a socialist economic base. Now, the Vietnamese people are working hard with high labor enthusiasm to realize the three-year plan for developing and transforming the economy and developing culture. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the brilliant achievements made by the fraternal Vietnamese people.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and strictly fulfilled the Geneva Accords, making unremitting efforts to maintain peace in Indochina and achieve the reunification of the motherland, which has won the praise and support of peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese government and people firmly believe that the just struggle of the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland, safeguard the Geneva Accords, and stop the United States from splitting Vietnam and undermining peace in Indochina will surely win the final and complete victory.

Over the past year, the long-standing traditional friendship and comprehensive mutual assistance and cooperation between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples have continued to develop and consolidate in the cause of building socialism and the common struggle against aggression and in defense of peace, thereby helping to strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

May the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples last forever.
