We must value archival work and improve archival work.

Archival work is a great and historically significant undertaking. It records and preserves the facts and experiences of our nation's and society's political struggles, as well as the facts and experiences of production struggles, in all their aspects. The first step is to collect these materials systematically. By "systematically," we mean analyzing the content, classifying and organizing it into files, thus creating systematic materials, or what we call historical materials. The second step is to extract the best of these materials and compile them into books. Merely completing the first step is not enough. Because there are so many archives, it is impossible to read them all, and if they are not read, they cannot be utilized. Therefore, the second step is necessary: to extract some materials for people in various regions and fields to read. No matter what happens in any aspect of the country, archivists can provide materials at any time. This allows us to disseminate and promote good experiences from human history, and to learn from bad experiences so that we do not repeat them, and avoid repeating past mistakes. Therefore, archival work was important in the past, it is important now, and it will be important in the future.

Our country has always done a good job in archival work. However, the term "archives" is relatively recent. Archival practices existed in our country even before writing. The "Book of Changes" records that in ancient times, people "governed by tying knots." In ancient times, there was no writing, so people tied knots in ropes; a big knot for a big event, and a small knot for a small event. Later, when we had writing but no pens or paper, we carved characters on oracle bones. "Jia" refers to shells, and "Gu" refers mostly to the bones of cattle and sheep. Oracle bone script probably originated around 1700 BC. The oracle bone inscriptions that have been discovered can be used to investigate the social conditions of that time. The oracle bone inscriptions we study are the archives of that period. Later, recording writing on wooden and bamboo slips was a step forward. Because they were bamboo and wooden slips, accumulating them would take up a lot of space; the archives of that time must have been quite large. Confucius wrote the "Spring and Autumn Annals," recording 242 years of events, and Zuo Qiuming helped him write the commentaries. How was Confucius able to write the "Spring and Autumn Annals"? It is said that he read the "precious books" of 120 states. The so-called "precious books" were the archives kept by these states. He traveled to these states, saw these materials, and then wrote the "Spring and Autumn Annals." His disciple, Zuo Qiuming, then wrote the "Zuo Commentary." Without those "precious books," how could he have written the "Spring and Autumn Annals"? We can say that those "precious books" kept by various states are what we now call materials systematically organized by archivists. Confucius wrote the "Spring and Autumn Annals" by synthesizing these materials, recording the most important and noteworthy events, which is the second step. Without the first step, the second step is impossible. In that era, it was the feudal era, and there were specialized officials in charge of this, called "historians," who were the people who managed the archives. They had everything. These people generally did not change positions; they regularly managed that work. Not only did they not change, but if their father managed it, the son also managed it, and the grandson also managed it. Sima Qian wrote the "Records of the Grand Historian," the first of the Twenty-Four Histories. He could not have written it all at once. His father was involved in this work. The institution he was in was actually an archive, like the "Huangshi Cheng." He looked at all the materials from ancient times, and spent his entire life creating this "Records of the Grand Historian." Of course, this "Records of the Grand Historian" is very inadequate from our current perspective, but it played a significant role in past history. This position of historian existed until the Qing Dynasty; the Hanlin scholars of the Hanlin Academy in the Qing Dynasty were called Taishi; wasn't Sima Qian called Taishigong? However, these Hanlin scholars were not necessarily the same as the historians of the past. Later, didn't China write many historical books? Although their content represents a royal family, it makes thousands of years of history, generally clear, and this is a significant contribution. If we want to understand what the past three thousand years have been like in a short period, it is impossible without these things. Without the work that predecessors did, what we now call archival work, we would have no way of knowing the past today.

Archival work is not a small undertaking. It concerns how the achievements of human history are passed down to future generations and how they are promoted. Many things we do for the first time today are said to be new, but someone familiar with the archives knows when this thing was done before and how it was done at that time. He can find materials and provide them for reference to those who are doing the work now. With this material, it is much easier for the people doing this work now. If we do not have those materials, or if we have those materials but we do not look at them, and no one specifically manages these materials, then of course we will not know. Then we have to start all over again, and as a result, we are redoing what we have done in the past; we are re-experiencing what we have done with experience in the past, which hinders the progress and advancement of our society. In order to provide the things in the archives for use today and help various tasks to proceed smoothly, it requires a lot of specialized personnel to engage in this work for a long time. Therefore, archivists must be dedicated to their work.

The purpose of archival work in the feudal era and capitalist countries was to serve their ruling classes, while the purpose of our archival work is to serve the people. Their archival work serves to maintain their exploitative system, while our archival work serves socialism. However, the methods of archival work, from collecting archives to compiling useful materials or history, some of those from the old ruling class era are good. What is good is that they preserved our country's history for many years, which is easy for us to understand at a glance without much effort. What is not good is that their archives and their history rarely record matters related to the people, whether it is the history of the people's struggles or the history of production. Now, if we want to study the social system and social struggle history of the feudal era, we often cannot find things in some official books or orthodox books, but we can find them in some private records or novels, because the purpose of the ruling class is to consolidate their rule and consciously not record things that are harmful to the ruling class. Our purpose today is to serve socialism, and the scope of this service is wider. We have a lot of things in all aspects of our socialist construction and various situations, and the archives formed must be preserved. Of course, the history and archives of the reactionary aspects must also be preserved, so that we know what the situation is like inside.

It is said that many counties in various places are doing this work. For example, in a county, the situation before and after the revolution, before and after victory, and before and after liberation, especially the construction situation after liberation, has many good things and many good experiences in it. Extracting them for future work reference is of great benefit. This work needs to be done by our archivists. For example, a person goes to work in a place, and when he picks up the book compiled based on the archives, he can know the situation of his place. If there is no such book? You can't figure out the situation in that place, and you won't necessarily be accurate even if you work at it for half a year. Such books are also read by the general public, and there is a great accumulation of various production experiences in them, which is of great benefit. The National Archives Bureau recently held a national archival work data exhibition in Beijing, which reflected many new experiences worth learning, including the current work. Some things have not been done before but are indeed necessary for people's production and life. For example, some counties have written books on the local production experience of various crops and by-products, as well as the local cooking techniques. This has opened up new horizons for archival work. Therefore, don't think that archival work is only about sorting out the past and not today's affairs. In fact, if archival work is done well, the things extracted often rescue or guide very important current work.

Our archival work basically began to pay attention after the founding of the country. We also had archival work before the founding of the country, but it was difficult to do a good job of archival work at that time, because it was difficult to preserve archival materials during the guerrilla war; the archives were in everyone's satchel, and the satchel could not hold much. At that time, there were some good things, but unfortunately, we can't find them now, we can only find a little bit. The Museum of the Revolution has more or less a little bit. When we came out of Jiangxi for the Long March, we lost some materials, but we also brought out some, but unfortunately, we lost them on the way. There are very few archival materials left from that time, and not many archival materials from the liberated areas have been preserved. Aren't many agencies collecting them now? We can collect some more or less. In short, it is difficult to find all the archives of those times. However, some principles that should be derived from the experience of those times have been preserved due to the constant attention of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

The situation is different now, and we have the conditions to do a good job of archival work. In the past, because of the environment of guerrilla warfare, we could not establish an archives bureau to do this. Today we have the conditions. Today, under the leadership of the State Archives Bureau, all parts of the country have been launched, which shows that our country is now developing normally, and the experience and lessons we have accumulated are about to play a greater role.

We should not regard archival work as a very simple job that can be done well without much effort. In fact, archival work is also a specialized subject. Comrades who do archival work must study regularly and have a lot of common sense, even specialized knowledge, to do a good job. General social common sense, political common sense, and scientific common sense are all needed. Of course, archival work also needs to pay attention to many technical tasks. Isn't sorting materials with scientific methods also a technology? People who manage archives must be very familiar with the archives and have a method of searching for archives so that any file can be found at once. At the same time, archival work itself is also a place to learn knowledge, because the content inside is all the experience of things that have been done in various places, and you can learn a lot of knowledge. Archivists should be experts in a certain field after doing archival work for several years. An expert is someone who really knows things that others don't know, knows more than others, and can put forward specific suggestions for solving problems. Therefore, comrades who are engaged in this work must work hard to study and not underestimate this work. Our archival work has not been established for long, so we must value archival work and do a good job of archival work.

    我们要重视档案工作做好档案工作
    谢觉哉
    档案工作是一个伟大的有悠久历史性的工作。它把我们国家社会各个方面的政治斗争的事实和经验，生产斗争的事实和经验，记录下来，保存起来。头一步，把这些材料，有条不紊地收集起来。说有条不紊，就是把它的内容加以分析，分类整理成卷，成为有系统的材料，即所谓史料。第二步，就是从这些材料里边抽出好的来编成书。仅只有第一步工作，是不够的。因为档案有这么多，不可能都去看，不去看，就得不到利用。所以，接着必须有第二步工作，在里边抽出一些东西来，供各个地方，各个人去阅读。国家无论在那个方面发生了什么事，档案工作者可以随时提供材料。这样就使我们人类历史上许多已经做过的事：好的经验就把它发扬传播开来，坏的经验就可以使我们有所鉴戒，不去重复那些坏事，碰过钉子的就不再去碰。所以档案工作过去重要，现在重要，将来还是重要。
    我国对档案工作历来是做得好的。不过档案这个名词到近代才有。我国没有文字以前就有档案。“易经”上载有上古时“结绳而治”的话。上古时没有文字，就拿一根绳子打结巴，做一件大事打一个大结巴，做一件小事打一个小结巴。后来，我们有了文字，还没有笔和纸张，就在甲骨上刻字。甲，就是一些贝壳；骨，大都是牛羊等骨。甲骨文大概产生在纪元前一千七百年。现在发现的甲骨文就可以考查出那个时候的社会情况。我们研究的甲骨文，就是当时的档案。到后来，把文字记载在木板子、竹片子上，那是进步了。因为它是竹片、木板，累起来就很多；那时的档案馆恐怕很不小。孔子著“春秋”，记载二百四十二年的事；左丘明帮他写出传来。孔夫子怎么能够著“春秋”呢？据说他看了一百二十国的“宝书”。所谓“宝书”，就是这些国家藏的档案，他跑到这些国家，看到这么一些，于是就写出了“春秋”。他的弟子左丘明就写出了“左传”。如果没有那些“宝书”，他怎么能写出“春秋”来呢？我们可以说各个国家藏的那些“宝书”，就是我们现在说的，经过档案工作者有条不紊整理出来的材料。孔子写“春秋”，是把这些材料融化起来，里边很重要的、值得记述的把它记载起来，这就是第二步工作。没有第一步工作，第二步工作是没有法子做的。那个时代是封建时代，管理这个事的有专门的官，叫做“史官”，这个史官，就是管理档案的人。他那里什么都有，这些人大体是不变动的，他经常管那个工作，不仅不变动，而且他父亲管这个事，儿子也管这个事，孙子也管这个事。司马迁著“史记”，是二十四史的头一部。他不是一下子就能写好的，他的父亲就是搞这个事的，他在的那个机构，实际上是一个档案馆，像“皇史宬”一样。他看了从古以来所有的材料，化了一生的功夫，创作了这部“史记”出来。这部“史记”，在我们这个时代看起来，当然很不足，但是在过去的历史上起过很大作用。这个史官的职务到清朝还有，清朝翰林院的翰林就叫做太史；司马迁不是叫做太史公吗？不过这些翰林，不一定是过去那个史官的职务。以后，中国历史上不也著了很多史书？现在尽管它的内容是代表一个帝王的家庭的，但是几千年的事体，大体都清楚，这贡献就不小了。我们要以很短暂的时间，了解过去三千几百年到底是一个什么情况，没有这些东西是不可能的。没有前人做这个现在叫作档案工作的事，我们今天无法晓得过去。
    档案工作不是一件小工作。它关系到我们人类历史上的成就，怎么样传到后代去，怎样发扬它。很多事情我们今天初次去做，说是新的，而熟悉档案的人，他就知道这件事在什么时候曾经做过，那个时候怎么做的。他可以找出材料来，供给现在做事的人参考。有了这个材料，现在做这个工作的人就方便多了。如果没有那些材料，或有了那些材料，我们没有去看，没有人专门去掌管这些材料，当然也就不晓得了。于是我们就要重新做起，结果过去做过的，我们今天又重新做；过去做过有经验的，我们也重新来搞一次经验，这就对我们这个社会的进步、前进有妨碍。要把档案里边的东西，来供给今天使用，帮助各项工作顺利进行，就需要很多的专门人材长期来搞这项工作，因此，档案工作者一定要安心工作。
    封建时代、资本主义国家，他们的档案工作的目的，是为它那个统治阶级服务的，我们的档案工作的目的，是为人民服务的。它们的档案工作是为保持它们那个剥削制度而服务的，我们的档案工作是为社会主义服务的。但搞档案的方法，从收集档案起一直到编成有用的材料或者历史，旧的统治阶级时代有些是好的。所谓好，它保存了多年来我们国家的历史，我们一看就容易清楚，不要费多少力。说不好，是它那档案里面，它那个历史里面，很少记载有关人民这方面的事，无论人民方面的斗争的历史，生产的历史，都很少。现在我们要研究封建时代的社会制度，社会斗争史，常常在一些官书、正书上面看不到的东西，而能在一些私人记载或小说上看到，因为统治阶级的目的是巩固他们的统治，有意识地不记载有害于统治阶级的事。我们今天的目的是为社会主义服务，这个服务范围是广一些，我们社会主义各个方面的建设，各种情况，事情很多，所形成的档案，都要保存。当然，那一些反动方面的历史和档案，我们也要保存，保存下来，就晓得那里面是怎样的情况。
    据说各个地方许多县都在那里做这个工作。比如一个县，这个县的革命前后、胜利前后、解放前后的情况，特别是解放以后建设的情况，那里边有许多好的事情，许多好的经验，把它提炼出来，供今后工作参考，有很大的好处。这项工作是需要我们档案工作者来做的。例如一个人跑到一个地方去工作，拿到那本根据档案整理出来的书一看，就可以晓得他这个地方的情况；如果没有那本书呢？你就摸不着那个地方的情况，至少摸半年还不一定准确。这样的书，一般人民也会看，那里边有各种生产经验的积累，好处极大。最近国家档案局在北京举办的全国档案工作资料展览会里就反映出了很多包括当前工作上新的值得学习的经验。有些是以前没有做过而又确实是人民生产和生活上所必需的，例如有的县把当地生产各种农作物、副产品的经验、以及各地的烹饪技术，写成书。为档案工作开辟了新的天地。所以说，不要以为档案工作，只是整理过去的而不是今天的事。其实，档案工作做得好，提炼出的东西常常是挽救了或者指导了当前的很重大的工作。
    我们的档案工作基本上是在开国以后才开始注意。我们在开国以前，也有档案工作，可是那个时候很难把档案工作做好，因为游击战争的时候，很难保存档案材料；档案在每人的挂包里面，挂包装不了多少，当时有些好东西，可惜现在找不着了，只可以找到一点子，革命历史博物馆多多少少也有一点子。从江西出来长征的时候，损失了一些材料，也带出来一些，可惜在路上失掉了。那个时候的档案材料，遗留下来的很少，解放区的档案材料保存下来的也不多，现在不是有许多机关正在那里收集吗？多少可以收集一些。总之，那些时候的档案是很难找全了。不过那些时候的经验所应得出来的一些原则，由于党中央和毛主席的经常注意，都保留下来了。
    现在情况就不同了，有条件可以把档案工作作好。过去因为游击战争的环境，不能成立一个档案局来搞这件事，今天我们有了条件。今天在国家档案局的领导下面，全国各地都已经搞起来了，这就表示我们国家现在进到正常发展，而我们积累起来的这个经验教训，正要发挥更大的作用。
    我们不要把档案工作看作是一件十分简单、不用费什么力气就可以做好的工作。其实档案工作也是一门专门的学问。做档案工作的同志要经常学习，要具有很多常识，以至于专门知识才能做好。一般的社会常识、政治常识、科学常识都是需要的。当然档案工作也要注意许多技术工作，以科学方法整理材料不也是一种技术吗？管理档案的人，要很熟悉档案，要有查档案的方法，任何案卷，一找就得。同时，档案工作本身也就是一个学知识的地方，因为里面的内容都是各个地方做过的事的经验，可以学到很多知识。档案工作者，做了若干年档案工作后应该是某一方面的专家。专家就是别人不晓得的事他真正晓得，别人晓得少，他晓得多，能够提出解决问题的具体意见。所以，我们搞这项工作的同志要下苦功钻，不要轻看这个工作。我们这个档案工作兴办起来还不久，我们一定要重视档案工作，做好档案工作。
