Talking about the Weightlifting Competition of the National Games
    Qu Zhichuan
    The weightlifting competition of the First National Games has already begun on the 14th. This competition is a major review of weightlifting in our country. One hundred and sixty-three strongmen from twenty-eight representative teams are participating, including thirty Master Athletes. In recent days, they have been practicing hard, preparing to create the best results at the National Games.
    The widespread development of weightlifting in our country has only happened in recent years. Before liberation, only one national competition and one test were held. Few people participated, and the highest records were only at the level of the current first and second-class athletes. Take the so-called Seventh "National Games" organized by the Kuomintang in 1948, for example, only nineteen athletes participated in five weight classes. At that time, the national record for the total score in the middleweight class was not even as high as the current record for the lightest weight class. Since the first National Weightlifting Championship was held in 1955, it has only been five years, but under the guidance of the Party's correct sports policy, we have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Weightlifting has changed its past backwardness and has developed and improved rapidly in all aspects. In the past few years, seven major national competitions have been held, with more than 1,400 participants. More than thirty Master Athletes have emerged, and more than forty people have broken national records more than six hundred times. Each of the twenty-one individual events has greatly improved, with the smallest increase being 16 kilograms and the largest reaching 57.5 kilograms. The total score of the seven weight classes has increased by at least 60 kilograms and up to 132.5 kilograms. Moreover, from 1956 to the present, three people (Chen Jingkai, Huang Qianghui, Zhao Qingkui) have broken the world records eleven times in the snatch of the lightest weight class, featherweight, lightweight, and light heavyweight classes. So far, we hold four of the world records for the snatch in the seven weight classes. In international competitions, we have defeated the weightlifting teams of countries with more developed weightlifting programs such as the United Arab Republic and Japan. In the few major international competitions in which our country participated, our weightlifting athletes all achieved good rankings. According to the results of the most recent international weightlifting championships, the results of our weightlifting athletes, except for the heavyweight class, can be ranked in the top six in the other six classes. Among them, Chen Jingkai, Huang Qianghui, and Zhao Qingkui can also be ranked in the top three, and Huang Qianghui can even compete for the championship.
    The weightlifting competition at this National Games is also a highly anticipated event. Among the twenty-eight participating units, the People's Liberation Army, Shanghai, Guangdong, Hebei, Beijing, and Sichuan are relatively strong. Among the more than 160 athletes participating in this competition, there are our familiar world record holders Chen Jingkai, Huang Qianghui, and Zhao Qingkui, and other outstanding athletes; there are national record holders Zhu Hongquan, Li Baiyu, etc.; and there is also Chang Guanqun, a nearly fifty-year-old veteran weightlifter from the Shanghai team in the heavyweight class, but the vast majority are young athletes who have been practicing weightlifting for a short time. These world and national record holders have improved their results after a year of intense training, and may create newer records in this competition. Some young athletes, encouraged by the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, will surely emerge as a group of rising stars.
    In this competition, apart from the already held lightest weight class competition, Huang Qianghui in the lightweight class, Zhao Qingkui in the light heavyweight class, and Li Baiyu in the light heavyweight class, should have no problem winning the championship, barring any accidents. The battle for the championships in the featherweight, middleweight, and heavyweight classes will be very fierce. Chen Jiafu from the Sichuan team and You Jiadong from the Inner Mongolia team in the featherweight class have total scores of around 330 kilograms, and Yu Zhuquan from the Guangdong team has recently reached a total score of 330 kilograms. There are even more good players in the middleweight class. Peng Guofu from the People's Liberation Army team, Shu Gang from the Guangdong team, and Zhu Hongquan from the Shanghai team have total scores of between 370 and 380 kilograms. Chang Guanqun from the Shanghai team and Han Laixiang from the People's Liberation Army team in the heavyweight class also have scores of around 400 kilograms. Who will win the championship depends not only on experience, strength, and technique, but also on the preparation for the competition, and even on the weight of the athletes, but more importantly on their political awareness and enthusiasm. Whoever has liberated thinking and is full of energy will be the winner of this competition.

    谈全运会的举重比赛
    曲治全
    第一届全国运动会的举重比赛已经在14日开始，这次比赛是我国举重运动的一次大检阅。参加比赛的有二十八个代表队的一百六十三名大力士，其中有运动健将三十人。近些天来，他们积极苦练，准备在全运会上创造最好的成绩。
    举重运动在我国普遍地开展起来还是最近几年的事。解放前只举行过一次全国性的比赛和一次测验，参加的人寥寥无几，最高纪录也只有现在一、二级运动员的水平。拿1948年国民党办的所谓第七届“全国运动会”来说，只有十九个运动员参加五个等级的比赛。那时候次重量级总成绩的全国纪录，还没有现在最轻量级的纪录高。解放后，从1955年举行第一次全国举重锦标赛起到现在也只有五年的时间，但是在党的正确的体育方针的指导下，我们学习了苏联的先进经验，举重运动已一改过去的落后面貌，在各方面有了迅速的发展和提高，几年来已举行了七次较大的全国性的比赛，参加的人数达一千四百多人次，涌现出三十多名运动健将，有四十多人共打破了全国纪录六百多次，二十一个单项成绩，项项都有很大的提高，最少的也提高十六公斤，多的达到五十七点五公斤，七个级的总成绩最少的也提高了六十公斤，最多的达一百三十二点五公斤。而且从1956年到现在已有三人（陈镜开、黄强辉、赵庆奎）十一次打破最轻级、次轻级、轻量级、轻重级等四个级挺举的世界纪录。到现在为止，七个级别的挺举世界纪录，我们已占了四个。在国际比赛中，我们曾赢过阿联、日本等举重运动较发达的国家的举重队。在有我国参加的几次较大的国际比赛中，我们的举重运动员全部获得了好的名次。根据最近几次国际举重锦标赛的成绩来看，我国的举重运动员的成绩除重量级外，其余六级都可列入前六名，其中陈镜开、黄强辉、赵庆奎还可列入前三名，特别是黄强辉还可争一下冠军。
    在这次全运会上的举重比赛，也是极为引人注意的项目，在二十八个参加比赛的单位中，以解放军、上海、广东、河北、北京、四川等六队实力较强。在参加这次比赛的一百六十多名运动员中，有我们熟悉的世界纪录保持者陈镜开、黄强辉和赵庆奎等优秀选手；有全国纪录保持者朱鸿全、李白玉等；也有近五十岁的举重老将上海队重量级选手常冠群，但绝大多数还是一些练习举重不久的年轻的选手们。这些世界纪录和国家纪录保持者经过了一年的紧张的锻炼，成绩又有提高，在这次比赛中可能创造更新的纪录。一些年轻的选手中，在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，也必定会出现一批后起之秀。
    这次比赛中，除已举行的最轻级比赛外，轻量级的黄强辉，轻重级的赵庆奎和次重级的李白玉，如无意外，取得冠军当无问题。而次轻级、中量级和重量级的冠军争夺战将是非常激烈的，次轻级四川队的陈家富和内蒙古队的尤家栋的总成绩都在三百三十公斤上下，广东队的余祝权总成绩最近也达到了三百三十公斤。中量级的好手则更多，解放军队的彭国富、广东队的舒刚和上海队的朱鸿全的总成绩都在三百七十到三百八十公斤之间。重量级中上海队的常冠群和解放军队的韩来祥成绩也都在四百公斤上下。谁将夺得冠军，不但要从经验上、力量上和技术上看，也要从比赛的准备上，甚至要从体重上看，但更重要的是从政治上和干劲上来看。谁思想解放，干劲十足，谁就将是这次比赛的胜利者。
