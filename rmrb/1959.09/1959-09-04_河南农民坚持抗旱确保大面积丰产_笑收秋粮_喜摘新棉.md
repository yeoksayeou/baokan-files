(Reported by our newspaper from Zhengzhou on September 3rd) More than 18 million mu of early autumn crops such as corn, sorghum, millet, and rice in Henan Province are generally ripe. As of August 30th, 13 million mu have been harvested.

This year, Henan Province suffered a severe drought, but thanks to the great power of the People's Communes in the fight against drought, early autumn crops in most areas have achieved bumper harvests. In the Xinyang Special Zone, which had not rained for more than 40 consecutive days, the yield of more than 3 million mu of early rice generally exceeded last year's output. The average yield per mu of the 10,580 mu of early rice already harvested in Gushi County increased by about 30% compared to last year. The more than 12,000 mu of sorghum in the Liaohe Commune of Nanyang County increased by 40% per mu compared to last year. Many communes have also seen large areas of high-yield fields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu.

From the time the drought emerged to the harvest season, the daily mobilization of the drought-fighting army in the province often remained at more than 20 million people. Under the slogan of "If the sky is dry, the fields are not dry, fight the drought to the end," they ate and lived in the fields, fighting day and night in shifts. The Dazhouzhuang Production Team of the Liaohe Commune in Nanyang County, located in the hilly area, with the assistance of three other production teams, expanded the reservoir built after the communization last year, and used 30 waterwheels to draw water up the hills, ensuring that more than 300 mu of autumn fields received two to three irrigations, increasing production by 30% to 50% compared to last year. The Dachong, Baichong, and Qingpeng brigades of the Pengxin Commune in Luoshan County worked together to dig mountains and build bridges, built two large canals, and diverted water from the Qingpeng Reservoir, irrigating more than 2,800 mu of drought-stricken rice fields, preserving the harvest.

The bumper harvest of early autumn crops has further boosted the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and a late-autumn surpassing-early-autumn campaign, with disaster resistance and strengthened management as its content, has already been launched throughout the province with great momentum.

(Reported by our newspaper from Zhengzhou on September 3rd) More than 12.4 million mu of cotton in Henan Province, one of China's main cotton-producing areas, are generally flowering. Cotton farmers are happily picking new cotton while actively strengthening the late-stage management of cotton fields, striving to produce more cotton as a gift to National Day.

This year, the cotton in Henan Province generally flowered more than ten days earlier than in previous years. As of August 28th, a total of more than 18.8 million jin had been harvested. The commercial departments purchased more than 3.79 million jin. After inspection, the quality of the new cotton is better than last year, with white color, long velvet, low moisture content, and large surface fraction.

This year, the farmers in the cotton-producing areas of Henan Province generally implemented early planting, early seedling setting, early pest control, early mid-tillage, and early topdressing, especially persistently fighting against natural disasters such as insects and drought, breaking the conventional wisdom that cotton is drought-resistant and afraid of watering. Many areas immediately irrigated when drought symptoms just appeared. Up to now, nearly 6 million mu of drought-stricken cotton fields in the province have been irrigated one to three times. Therefore, the cotton in most areas this year has grown better than in previous years. The first and second class cotton fields account for more than 80%, and each plant generally has an average of five to ten bolls.

In order to produce more cotton for the country as a gift to National Day, the cotton farmers in various places are actively carrying out the late-stage management movement of cotton fields, focusing on drought resistance and pest control, and aiming at more autumn bolls, large bolls, and full bolls from top to bottom. In the Xinxiang Special Zone, more than 880,000 laborers are invested in cotton field management every day, changing the old habit of "hanging up the hoe after the beginning of autumn," mid-tilling more than 1.09 million mu of cotton fields, irrigating 896,000 mu, topdressing 476,000 mu, and controlling insects on 833,000 mu in five days. The Sun Guiying cotton planting team in Xinye County used three water pumps to draw water from the more than three-zhang-deep Baihe River to the high slopes, so that the more than 40 mu of cotton on the slopes continuously drank water twice, and combined watering with seven times of mid-tillage to conserve moisture. The Zhangjiazhuang Brigade of the Shaojiatun Commune in Anyang County drew special personnel to fertilize and water the 562 mu of third-class cotton fields, and 490 mu of cotton have been generally upgraded. In order to find back the buds and bolls that fell off due to drought, the cotton farmers in various places in the Luoyang Special Zone are actively carrying out the overproduction movement of "losing in the early stage, finding in the late stage; losing summer bolls, salvaging autumn bolls" with topdressing, watering, and pest control as the content.

    河南农民坚持抗旱确保大面积丰产
    笑收秋粮　喜摘新棉
    本报郑州3日电　河南省一千八百多万亩早秋作物玉米、高粱、谷子和水稻等普遍成熟。到8月30日止，已经收割一千三百万亩。
    今年河南省遭受了严重干旱，但是由于人民公社在抗旱中发挥了巨大威力，大部分地区的早秋作物获得丰收。一连四十多天未下雨的信阳专区的三百多万亩早稻，普遍超过去年产量。固始县已收打的一万零五百八十亩早稻，平均亩产量比去年增产约三成。南阳县潦河公社的一万二千多亩高粱，亩产量比去年增加四成。许多公社并出现了百亩以上亩产超过千斤的大面积丰产田。
    从旱象露头到收割时期，全省每天出动的抗旱大军经常保持在二千万人以上。他们在“天旱田不旱，有旱抗到底”的口号下，吃住在田，日夜轮番鏖战。南阳县潦河公社位于岗坡地带的大周庄生产队，在其他三个生产队的协助下，扩建了去年公社化后修建的水库，用三十部水车，节节引水上岗，保证三百多亩秋田得到二至三遍水，比去年增产三到五成。罗山县彭新公社大冲、白冲、青棚三个大队，同心协力凿山架桥，修了两条大渠道，引出青棚水库的水，共浇灌了二千八百多亩受旱的稻田，保住了收成。
    早秋作物的丰收，进一步鼓舞了群众的革命干劲，一个以抗灾害、加强管理为内容的晚秋超早秋运动，已经在全省汹涌澎湃地展开。
    本报郑州3日电　我国主要产棉地区之一的河南省的一千二百四十多万亩棉花普遍吐絮。棉农们一面喜摘新棉，一面积极加强棉田后期管理，力争生产更多的棉花向国庆节献礼。
    今年河南省的棉花普遍比往年提前十多天吐絮，到8月28日止，已累计收摘了一千八百多万斤。商业部门收购了三百七十九万多斤，经过检验，新棉质量比去年好，色白、绒长、水分少、表分大。
    河南省产棉区的农民今年普遍实行了早种、早定苗、早治虫、早中耕、早追肥，特别是持久地同虫、旱自然灾害进行了斗争，打破了多年来认为棉花耐旱、怕浇水的常规。许多地区在旱象刚露头的时候，就立即浇灌。到目前止，全省已有近六百万亩受旱棉田浇了一到三遍水。因此，今年大部分地区的棉花都比往年生长得好。一、二类棉田占80％以上，一般每株平均已有五到十成铃。
    各地棉农们为了给国家生产更多的棉花作为向国庆节的献礼，正以抗旱、治虫为中心，以多座秋桃、座大桃、上下满桃为目标，积极开展棉田后期管理运动。新乡专区每天投入棉田管理的劳力达八十八万多人，改变了过去“立了秋，挂锄钩”的旧习惯，五天内就中耕棉田一百零九万多亩，灌溉八十九万六千多亩，追肥四十七万六千亩，治虫八十三万三千亩。新野县孙桂英植棉专业队，用三部抽水机把三丈多深的白河水引上高岗，使岗上的四十多亩棉花连续喝了二次水，结合浇水还中耕保墒七次。安阳县邵家屯公社张家庄大队，抽出专人对五百六十二亩三类棉田加肥加水以后，已有四百九十亩棉花普遍升了级。洛阳专区各地棉农为了找回因干旱而脱落的蕾铃，正积极开展以追肥、浇水、治虫为内容的“前期丢，后期找；伏桃丢，秋桃捞”的超产运动。（附图片）
