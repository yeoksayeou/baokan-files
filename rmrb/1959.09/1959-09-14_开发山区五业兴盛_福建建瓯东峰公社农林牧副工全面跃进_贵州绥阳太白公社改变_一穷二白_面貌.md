    Developing Mountain Areas for Prosperous Five Industries
    Dongfeng Commune in Jian'ou, Fujian Achieves All-Round Leap Forward in Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Industry
    Taibai Commune in Suiyang, Guizhou Changes "Poor and Blank" Situation

    According to Xinhua News Agency, since its establishment in September last year, the Dongfeng People's Commune in Jian'ou County, a mountainous area in northern Fujian Province, has achieved an all-round leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and industrial production. In the first half of this year, the average yield of more than 17,000 mu of early rice in the commune increased by 24.5% compared with the bumper harvest of last year, livestock increased by 20% compared with last year, tea increased by more than two times compared with last year, timber increased by more than one time compared with last year, and industrial output value increased by more than one time compared with last year. The average pre-distribution income of commune members in the summer increased by nearly half compared with the same period last year.

    Dongfeng Commune is located in the high mountains and dense forests of Jian'ou County. The commune has more than 5,000 households, with a population of more than 23,000, owning more than 70,000 mu of cultivated land and more than 620,000 mu of mountain forest, with a timber reserve of more than 3.4 million cubic meters. In the Great Leap Forward last year, this commune fully utilized the advantages of its large scale, wide range of activities, and the ability to统筹 (tǒng chóu, coordinate) overall production and reasonably arrange labor, and carried out undertakings that agricultural cooperatives could not carry out, accelerating the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and industrial production throughout the commune. According to the characteristics of communization, which can uniformly arrange labor on a larger scale, the commune established specialized production teams for agriculture, forestry, tea, animal husbandry, and economic forests, overcoming the contradictions of the past, when advanced cooperatives were too small and weak to simultaneously manage grain, timber, and various economic productions. Due to large-scale cooperation, water and drought disasters were overcome, enabling various productions to develop comprehensively in proportion. For example, in the past, the DaDi Production Brigade, which had few people and a lot of land, found it difficult to engage in other production when engaging in agricultural production. After communization, in addition to transferring some commune members with timber production experience to participate in the commune-run logging yard production, the remaining commune members can concentrate on agricultural production. During the busy season of rice transplanting, although seven dams in the brigade were washed away by mountain floods, and more than 400 mu of land was flooded, and more than 2,000 mu of early rice were threatened by water and drought, all the flooded seedlings and damaged water conservancy projects could be rescued and repaired in time with the efforts of the brigade members and the help of brother brigades, making the brigade's early rice appear a miracle of increasing production by more than 15% compared with the bumper harvest of last year in a year of major disasters. The amount of public grain and surplus grain sold to the state by the commune in the early season also increased from 11.85 million jin last year to 13 million jin.

    The commune-run logging yards and the specialized team members of each brigade who specialize in mountain forest production, give full play to their specialties, and make labor efficiency increase by about 40% compared with the past, and the output of timber, tea and mountain forest specialties of the whole commune has increased many times. Timber production increased sharply from more than 20,000 cubic meters last year to more than 50,000 cubic meters, and tea production also increased from 16,500 jin last year to 45,000 jin.

    Commune-run and team-run industries have also developed greatly. The commune has established 19 factories, including farm tool factories, indigenous chemical fertilizer factories, rice mills, and sugar factories; five power stations have been built, and each commune member's household has an average of more than 30 watts of electricity. In the seven months since this year, the total industrial output value of the commune has reached more than 43,000 yuan.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Taibai People's Commune in Suiyang County, a high and cold mountainous area in northern Guizhou, has changed its poor and backward appearance through unified management and comprehensive development over the past year. In 1958, the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries increased by one and a half times compared with 1957; 92% of the households in the commune increased their income. This year, only in the summer pre-distribution, the total income of the commune increased by 64% compared with the same period in 1958, and every household increased its income. 70% of the households in the commune have reached the living standard of "complete clothing, comfortable living, and savings in the family."

    With the development of production and the increase of public accumulation, the commune has rapidly expanded capital construction. The commune has built a total of 51 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, purchased more than 3,400 pieces of large-scale agricultural implements, and built 46 livestock pens and silkworm farms. In addition, nearly 200,000 yuan of public property was added.

    Before liberation, the people's lives in Taibai Commune were very poor. A folk song was popular in the area: "Zhao Li, Zhao Li (the name of the place where the commune is located), dressed strangely, 18-year-old girls have no pants, and 80-year-old men have only one layer of palm clothing." After liberation, with the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperative movement, the appearance has greatly changed. However, due to the small scale of agricultural cooperatives and the narrow range of activities, there was no power to comprehensively develop the mountain economy. After communization, the situation changed fundamentally. In order to quickly change this low-yield situation, the commune carried out large-scale soil improvement work. In one year, in combination with spring plowing, autumn plowing, and winter plowing, all the barren soil was transformed in batches. While improving the soil, the commune relied on collective wisdom to solve the problem of autumn wind harm. About 3,000 mu of land in the commune was often affected by wind disasters, and there was no harvest at all in severe cases. The leaders and masses of the commune, through in-depth observation and repeated experiments, and holding many forums with old farmers, finally figured out the law of autumn wind harm, and found a way to advance the maturity period of crops to avoid the autumn wind. This year, the planting time of crops has been advanced by almost a month; the areas that are often affected by autumn winds have almost all been replaced with early-maturing varieties. This year, all kinds of crops in the commune can completely avoid the harm of autumn winds.

    In accordance with the spirit of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains and relying on the mountains to raise the mountains," the commune made full use of the rich resources of the mountainous area and operated 45 sideline productions, an increase of 24 items compared with last year. The total value of sideline productions operated in the first half of the year reached more than 218,000 yuan, accounting for 80% of the total income of agricultural and sideline industries.

    开发山区五业兴盛
    福建建瓯东峰公社农林牧副工全面跃进
    贵州绥阳太白公社改变“一穷二白”面貌
    据新华社讯　福建省北部山区的建瓯县东峰人民公社，从去年9月间成立以来，农、林、牧、副和工业生产获得了全面跃进。在今年的半年多时间中，全公社一万七千多亩早稻平均产量比大丰收的去年增加24.5％，牲畜比去年增加了20％，茶叶比去年增加了二倍多，木材比去年增加一倍多，工业产值比去年增加了一倍多，社员夏季预分收入平均比去年同期增加近半倍。
    东峰公社地处建瓯县高山密林之间，全社共有五千多户、两万三千多人，拥有七万多亩耕地和六十二万多亩山林，林木蓄积量达三百四十多万立方米。这个公社在去年大跃进中，充分发挥了规模大、活动范围广、可以统筹全社生产和合理安排劳力等优越性，兴办了农业社难以兴办的事业，加快了全社农林牧副和工业生产的综合发展。根据公社化后能在较大范围内统一安排劳动力的特点，全社分别成立了农业、林业、茶叶、畜牧、经济林等专业生产队，克服了过去高级社时由于社小力薄，无法同时经营粮食、木材和多种经济生产的矛盾。由于大搞协作，战胜了水旱灾害，使各种生产都能按比例全面发展。例如原来人少地多，抓了农业生产就难于从事其他生产的大地生产大队，公社化后除了抽调一些有木材生产经验的社员参加社办伐木场生产外，其余社员都能安心从事农业生产。在插秧大忙时，全大队虽然有七条水坝被山洪冲坏了，有四百多亩地受淹、两千多亩早稻受到水旱威胁，但在本大队队员的奋力抢修和兄弟大队的帮助下，所有被淹禾苗和被冲坏的水利工程都能及时抢救和修复出来，使全大队早稻出现了大灾年反而比大丰收的去年增产15％以上的奇迹。全社早季交售给国家的公粮和余粮也由去年的一千一百八十五万斤增加到一千三百万斤。
    社办伐木场和各大队专门从事山林生产的专业队员，尽量发挥他们的特长，并使劳动效率比过去提高了40％左右，全社木材、茶叶和山林土特产的产量都成倍地增加。木材产量由去年的二万多立方米猛增到五万多立方米，茶叶产量也由去年的一万六千五百斤增加到四万五千斤。
    社办和队办工业，也有很大发展。全社共建立了农具厂、土化肥厂和碾米、制糖等厂十九座；建设了五个发电站，全社每户社员平均有电三十多瓦。在今年以来的七个多月中，全社工业总产值共达四万三千多元。
    据新华社讯　贵州北部高寒山区的绥阳县太白人民公社，经过一年来的统一经营，全面发展，已经改变了一穷二白的贫困落后面貌。1958年农副业总产值比1957年增长一倍半；全社92％的户增加收入。今年仅夏季预分，全社总收入就比1958年同期增长64％，户户增加收入。全社已经有70％的户达到了“穿戴齐备，居住舒适，家有存款”的生活水平。
    生产发展了，公共积累增加了，公社迅速扩大了基本建设。全社共兴修大、中型水利工程五十一处，购置大型农具三千四百多件，修建牲畜圈栏和蚕场四十六处。此外还增添了近二十万元的公共财产。
    太白公社在解放前，人民生活十分贫困。当地流行着这样一首歌谣：“赵里、赵里（公社所在的地名），穿得稀奇，十八岁的姑娘没有裤子，八十岁的老人只有一层棕衣。”解放后，随着农村互助合作运动的发展，面貌有了很大改观。但是由于农业社规模小，活动范围狭，没有力量全面发展山区经济。公社化以后，情况才起了根本的变化。为了迅速改变这一低产面貌，公社开展了大规模的土壤改良工作。一年间，结合春耕、秋耕和冬耕，分期分批改造了全部瘦土。在改良土壤的同时，公社依靠集体智慧，解决了秋风为害的问题，全社常遭风灾的土地约有三千多亩，严重的时候颗粒无收。公社领导干部和群众一起，经过深入观察和反复试验，召开多次老农座谈会，终于摸透了秋风为害的规律，找到了提早作物成熟期，避过秋风的办法。今年作物的播种时间，差不多提早了一个月；常遭秋风的地区，几乎全部换上了早熟品种。全社今年各种农作物可以完全避免秋风为害。
    公社按照“靠山吃山、依山养山”的精神，充分利用山区丰富的资源，经营了四十五项副业生产，比去年增加二十四项。上半年经营的副业生产总值达二十一万八千多元，占农副业总收入80％。
