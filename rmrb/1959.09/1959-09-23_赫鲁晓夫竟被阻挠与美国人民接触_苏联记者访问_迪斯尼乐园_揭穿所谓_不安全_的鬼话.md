Xinhua News Agency, Los Angeles, September 22nd: TASS reported from Los Angeles on September 20th: After seeing off the special train carrying the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and his entourage from Los Angeles to San Francisco, reporters from "Pravda," "Izvestia," "Komsomolskaya Pravda," and others set off to visit the famous American "Disneyland," a park established by Disney, the founder of American cartoon films. "Disneyland" is located dozens of kilometers from Los Angeles. As everyone knows, Khrushchev and his family had planned to visit there on the 19th. However, they were unable to go. Khrushchev mentioned the reason for not visiting when speaking to Hollywood filmmakers on the 19th. After learning this, we decided to visit "Disneyland" ourselves to find out what exactly was preventing the previously arranged visit for Khrushchev.

    Upon arriving at the park entrance, we explained our intentions to the gatekeeper, Cohen, and asked him to connect us with the "Disneyland" management. Cohen warmly welcomed us and asked, "Where is Mr. Khrushchev? We were waiting for him yesterday. There were so many people gathered here yesterday. On Friday, September 18th, we only had six thousand people here. But yesterday, there were so many people in the park that we couldn't accommodate them. I heard Mr. Khrushchev's speech in Hollywood last night. It's a shame that they didn't let him come here."

    Mr. Derby, who is in charge of news and external relations for "Disneyland" management, quickly came to meet us. After introducing himself, he immediately asked us if there was still any hope for Khrushchev to visit "Disneyland." After Mr. Derby learned that Khrushchev had already left Los Angeles, he said, "It's a pity that the visit was cancelled. Everyone and thousands of park visitors were waiting for Mr. Khrushchev and his family yesterday."

    At our request, Mr. Edwin Ettinger, the deputy manager of the "Disneyland" news and public relations office, spoke about what prevented Khrushchev from visiting "Disneyland." He said that there were an unbelievable number of visitors to the park yesterday, and they came before the park opened, hoping to see the distinguished guest.

    Ettinger said, "We were very surprised when we learned that Khrushchev wanted to come but was prevented from doing so by something. We were very disappointed that he couldn't come. We thought maybe Khrushchev wasn't interested in visiting 'Disneyland,' maybe he didn't have time. We listened to your Premier's television address and then we knew what had happened."

    Later, Mr. Ettinger gave us a detailed introduction to "the park." We spoke with many park visitors. Many of them had already come here yesterday and came again today, hoping that Khrushchev would come here today. After learning the reason for obstructing the visit, they assured us that nothing could endanger Khrushchev's safety at "Disneyland."

    After touring the park (which covers sixty-five acres), the Soviet journalists agreed with this view of the Americans, especially since Khrushchev was often guarded by hundreds of American police officers everywhere, even in less crowded places.

    The impression is that those who opposed Khrushchev's visit to the United States from the beginning are now doing everything possible to prevent Khrushchev from meeting with the American people in a peaceful and friendly atmosphere.

    赫鲁晓夫竟被阻挠与美国人民接触
    苏联记者访问“迪斯尼乐园”揭穿所谓“不安全”的鬼话
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社洛杉矶20日讯：“真理报”、“消息报”、“共青团真理报”和其他记者在欢送了苏联部长会议主席及其随行人员所乘的从洛杉矶开往旧金山的专车之后，就出发前往美国著名的“迪斯尼乐园”，这个公园是美国卡通电影创始人迪斯尼建立的。“迪斯尼乐园”距洛杉矶数十公里。大家知道，赫鲁晓夫一家人本来准备在19日到那里去参观。但是他们没有去成。赫鲁晓夫19日向好莱坞电影工作者讲话时提到了没有去参观的原因。我们知道了这个消息之后就决定亲自到“迪斯尼乐园”走一趟，以便弄清楚究竟是什么东西在阻挠事先为赫鲁晓夫安排好的参观活动。
    到了公园门口，我们向看门人科恩说明了来意并且要求他让我们同“迪斯尼乐园”管理处的人接洽。科恩热烈地欢迎了我们并且问道：“赫鲁晓夫先生在什么地方？我们昨天就在等他。昨天这里聚集了非常多的人。9月18日星期五，我们这里一共才来了六千人。而昨天来公园的人多得无法接待。我晚上听到了赫鲁晓夫先生在好莱坞的讲话。他们不让他来我们这里，简直可耻。”
    “迪斯尼乐园”管理新闻和对外联系事务的德尔比先生很快就跑来见我们。他作了自我介绍之后马上就问我们，还能希望赫鲁晓夫来参观“迪斯尼乐园”吗？德尔比先生知道赫鲁晓夫已经离开了洛杉矶的消息之后说：“很遗憾，这个参观取消了。我们大家和成千上万的游园者昨天一直在等待赫鲁晓夫先生一家人。”
    “迪斯尼乐园”新闻和公众联系处的副经理埃德温·埃廷格先生应我们要求谈到什么东西妨碍赫鲁晓夫来“迪斯尼乐园”参观时说，昨天公园的游客多得不得了，他们在公园开放之前就来了，希望见到贵宾。
    埃廷格说，“当我们知道赫鲁晓夫想来，但是却被某种事情所阻挠而不能来的时候，我们感到很惊讶。他不能来，使我们感到非常失望。我们想也许是赫鲁晓夫对参观
  ‘迪斯尼乐园’不感兴趣吧，也许是他没有时间吧。我们听了你们总理的电视讲话，才知道究竟发生了什么事情。”
    后来埃廷格先生详细地向我们介绍了“乐园”。我们同许多游园者谈了话。他们许多人昨天已经来过这里，今天再来这里，为的是希望赫鲁晓夫今天会来这里。他们知道了妨碍这次参观的原因之后，向我们保证说，没有什么东西能够危害赫鲁晓夫在“迪斯尼乐园”的安全。
    苏联记者参观了公园（这个公园占地六十五英亩）之后同意美国人的这种看法，何况赫鲁晓夫在到处、甚至于在人比较少的地方，也常常有数百名美国警察在保卫着他。
    给人的印象是，那些从一开始就反对赫鲁晓夫访美的人，现在还在千方百计地阻挠赫鲁晓夫在安宁和友好的气氛中同美国的老百姓会见。
