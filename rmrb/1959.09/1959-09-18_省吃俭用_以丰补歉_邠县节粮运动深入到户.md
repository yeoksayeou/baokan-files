Save and Thrift, Use Surplus to Compensate for Scarcity
    Bin County's Grain Saving Movement Deepens into Households
    Editor's Note: After the summer's bumper harvest, the Bin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shaanxi Province promptly led the masses in launching a grain-saving campaign, preventing the wasteful phenomenon of excessive eating and drinking that could have occurred at the time, strengthening the planning of grain use, and saving grain. This approach is worthy of attention.
    Grain is the treasure of treasures, and saving grain is everyone's responsibility. Bumper harvest areas should seize this work, and general areas and disaster-stricken areas should seize this work even more; cities should save grain, and rural areas should also save grain. If the work of saving grain is done well, the surplus grain in the hands of the state and farmers can be increased more quickly; with more grain in reserve, we can use surplus to compensate for scarcity in disaster years and live a good life.
    Now is the autumn harvest season. While harvesting, it is important to strengthen education on planned grain use and launch a mass grain-saving campaign to manage and use the bumper harvest well. This is a major task at present.
    (Our Report) Shaanxi's Bin County, based on the summer's bumper harvest, has launched a planned grain use and grain-saving campaign, which has achieved initial results. The movement is still developing.
    Bin County achieved a bumper harvest this summer. The total grain output reached 155.58 million jin, an increase of 43% compared to last summer's harvest. Among them, wheat increased by 40.6% compared to last year, summer coarse grains increased by 91.5% compared to last year, and rapeseed increased by 516.9% compared to last year. According to the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, after deducting seeds, feed, agricultural tax, public accumulation, and completing the summer grain purchase task, each person can be allocated more food grain on average. Thanks to relatively thorough preparation and the high patriotic enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, the summer grain purchase work has been overfulfilled by 25.77%.
    This summer's bumper crop harvest, the allocation of food grain to households, and the overfulfillment of grain purchase tasks are major victories on the grain front. However, with the emergence of this situation, some problems have occurred in terms of grain consumption. The main problem is that some cadres have become blindly optimistic, believing that since there is a bumper harvest, it doesn't matter if they don't pay attention to saving; others have said, "The masses have the habit of saving grain, and they will arrange how much to eat themselves," thus neglecting the propaganda and education and specific leadership on planned grain use and grain saving among the masses. Some of the masses also generated the idea that "the wheat has been harvested, and the autumn crops are growing well, why wait to eat well?" As a result, waste occurred in grain consumption. Wang Dexiang, a member of the Mingyu Chi Production Team of the Chengguan Commune, ate fifteen jin of grain in five days. The Yahe Wan canteen of the Beiji Commune not only lacked planning for grain use in meals but also scattered and wasted grain. According to inspections, more than thirteen jin of steamed bun crumbs and noodles were salvaged from the swill in one day.
    After learning about these situations, the Bin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a special study and discussion on the issue of grain waste among the masses, convened an emergency telephone conference attended by the first secretaries of the party committees of various communes, and immediately launched a planned grain use and grain-saving campaign; specially assigned a county magistrate to go deep into key areas, summarize experiences, and guide the overall situation; at the same time, launched a ten-day blitz propaganda campaign throughout the county, focusing on explaining to the masses the principle of "a trickle flows long," saving grain, and living rich days as if they were poor days. The County Committee required everyone to: ① Do a good job in grain storage to ensure the safety of stored grain; ② Open up various ways to save, with each household formulating a grain-saving plan and everyone paying attention to saving; ③ Be careful and meticulous in calculations, and set quotas per person; ④ Save two jin of grain per person per month in rural areas, and one jin per person per month in government offices, schools, and factories; ⑤ Each person in rural areas should store fifty jin of dried vegetables, and each household should plant another hundred radish seedlings and a hundred cabbage seedlings per person on the basis of existing vegetable plots; government offices, factories, and schools should also seize the opportunity to use all possible land to plant vegetables in large quantities; ⑥ Establish grain management organizations at all levels to conduct regular inspections and evaluations.
    After this call was issued and after extensive publicity and mobilization, it was immediately warmly supported by the vast number of cadres and the masses. All communes took emergency measures and widely organized cadres and the masses to discuss the issues of planned grain use and grain saving, and summarized the experiences and lessons of last year. Everyone believed that the leadership had foresight and seized the matter early, and that it was very necessary to raise this issue in a timely manner; at the same time, they expressed that during the autumn harvest, they would not only bring back all the high-yielding grain but also manage and use it well. Zhang Yongchang of the Zhengjia Management District of the Gouyi Commune said during a discussion on planned grain use: "Chairman Mao is so considerate in serving the people. If they hadn't reminded us, I think we would have run out of food in a few days." More than 18,000 households in the county have now formulated grain-saving plans, and they have proposed many ways to save grain, ensuring that each person saves two jin of grain per month. The Tuling Production Team of the Daqiao Commune mobilized commune members to use scattered land such as courtyards, field edges, dikes, riverbanks, and canal banks to plant 2,461 mu of vegetables and collect more than 69,000 jin of wild vegetables. When discussing ways to save grain, members of the Yufeng Team of the Changwu Commune proposed frugal methods such as changing pot cakes into steamed buns, adjusting the proportion of dry and liquid foods, and eating pure noodles mixed with vegetables. Currently, this planned grain use and grain-saving campaign is continuing to develop.

    省吃俭用　以丰补歉
    邠县节粮运动深入到户
    编者按：中共陕西邠县县委在夏季大丰收之后，及时地领导群众开展节约用粮运动，防止了当时可能发生的大吃大喝的浪费现象，加强了用粮计划性，节约了粮食。这种做法值得重视。
    粮食是宝中之宝，节约粮食人人有责。丰收地区要抓紧这项工作，一般地区和受灾地区更要抓紧这项工作；城市要节约粮食，农村也要节约粮食。节约粮食的工作做好了，国家和农民手中的余粮就可以较快地增加；储备的粮食多了，遇到灾荒年头就可以以丰补歉，把日子过得很好。
    现在正是秋收季节，在收获的同时，加强计划用粮的教育，开展群众性节约粮食运动，把丰收的粮食管好用好，这是当前一件大事。
    本报讯　陕西邠县在夏季大丰收的基础上，开展了计划用粮、节约用粮运动，已经收到初步的效果，现在运动还在继续发展中。
    邠县今年夏季获得了特大丰收。粮食总产量达到一亿五千五百八十万斤，比去年夏收增产43％。其中小麦比去年增产40.6％，夏杂粮比去年增产91.5％，油菜比去年增产516.9％。根据统筹兼顾、全面安排的原则，在扣除籽种、饲料、农业税、公共积累和完成夏粮征购任务以后，每人平均可分到较多的口粮。夏季征购工作，由于准备工作比较充分和广大社员爱国主义热情高涨，现已超额25.77％完成了任务。
    今年夏季作物丰收，口粮分配到户，征粮购粮超额完成任务，社员生产积极性空前高涨，这是粮食战线上的重大胜利。但是，随着这种情况的出现，在粮食吃用方面也曾经一度发生了一些问题。主要是部分干部有了盲目乐观情绪，认为丰收了，不注意节约也不要紧；还有人说：“群众有节约用粮的习惯，吃多吃少自己会安排”，因而一度忽视了对群众进行计划用粮、节约用粮的宣传教育和具体领导。部分群众也产生了“麦子打下啦，秋庄稼又长得好，不大吃还等什么”的思想，因而在粮食消费方面发生浪费现象。城关公社鸣玉池生产队社员王德祥，一个人五天就吃了十五斤粮食。北极公社鸦河弯食堂不仅吃饭用粮缺乏计划，而且抛撒浪费粮食。据检查，一天就从泔水中捞出馍花、面条十三斤多。
    中共邠县县委了解到这些情况之后，对群众浪费粮食问题作了专门的研究讨论，召开了各公社党委第一书记参加的紧急电话会议，立即开展了计划用粮、节约用粮运动；专门抽出一名县长，深入重点，总结经验，指导全面；同时在全县开展为期十天的突击宣传运动，着重向群众讲清楚细水长流、节约用粮，富日子要当穷日子过的道理。县委要求大家做到：①做好粮食保管工作，确保储粮安全；②广开节约门路，户户订出节约用粮计划，人人注意节约；③精打细算，按人定量；④农村每人每月节约二斤粮，机关、学校，厂矿每人每月节约一斤；⑤农村每人储备五十斤干菜，每户在现有菜地的基础上，每人再种百窝萝卜、百棵白菜；机关、工厂、学校也要抓紧时机，利用一切可能利用的土地，大量种菜；⑥各级成立粮食管理组织，定期检查评比。
    这一号召发出后，经过广泛的宣传动员，立即得到广大干部和群众的热烈拥护。各公社都采取了紧急措施，广泛组织干部、群众展开了关于计划用粮、节约用粮问题的讨论，总结了去年的经验教训。大家认为领导上看得远，抓得早，及时提出这个问题十分必要；同时表示，秋收中不仅要把丰产的粮食全部拿回来，还要管好、用好。枸邑公社郑家管理区张永昌在讨论计划用粮时说：“毛主席为人民办事，实在周到，不是他们提醒咱，再过些日子，我看吃的非歇下不可。”全县现在已有一万八千多户制定了节约用粮计划，他们提出许多节约粮食的办法，保证每月每人节约二斤粮。大桥公社土陵生产队发动社员利用院落、田边、地埂、河畔、渠岸等零星土地种蔬菜二千四百六十一亩，采集野菜六万九千多斤。长武公社芋丰队社员在讨论节约门路时，提出锅饼变蒸馍、干稀调剂、纯面掺菜吃等省吃俭用的办法。目前，这个计划用粮、节约粮食运动正在继续发展中。
