Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 15th: Jiangsu Province has reaped a bumper harvest of early autumn crops (including single-season early rice) on over 16 million mu. The total output has increased by more than 70% compared to last year, and the average yield per unit area has increased by more than 10% compared to last year.

This year, the area of early autumn crops (including single-season early rice) in Jiangsu Province has expanded by more than 5 million mu compared to last year, of which the early rice area has expanded from 2.64 million mu last year to 3.43 million mu. Areas that had never grown early rice in the past have also expanded their planting this year. The Taihu area in southern Jiangsu and the Lixiahe area in northern Jiangsu, and other rice-producing areas, grasped the early rice production season well this year, achieving early sowing and early transplanting, and rational close planting. Management was more meticulous than in previous years, and therefore greater harvests were obtained. Xie Tian Brigade of Shengze People's Commune in Wujiang County, due to seizing the season early, good transplanting quality, and meticulous field management, increased the average yield per mu by more than 30% compared to last year. Lishui County in the hilly mountainous area also increased the average yield per mu of 80,000 mu of early rice by 20% compared to last year. This year, the province's spring corn has also expanded by more than 2 million mu compared to last year. The Nantong area in the coastal area achieved large-scale high yields on 1.08 million mu of corn. The main experience of spring corn high yield is to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" in accordance with local conditions. This year, the plowing depth of cornfields throughout the province is generally above six inches, about two inches deeper than in previous years, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu is about 40 to 50 dan, of which the proportion of refined fertilizer has increased from about 30% last year to more than 50%. The variety layout and planting density are also more reasonable than in previous years, and the level of field management has also been greatly improved. In addition, soybeans, sorghum, and millet have also achieved bumper harvests.

The bumper harvest of early autumn crops shows the superiority of the people's communes. After communization, the layout of early autumn crops can be adjusted within a larger scope, stubble rotation can be arranged rationally, and planting can be done according to local conditions, thus giving full play to the potential of the land. This year, the province's 3.43 million mu of early rice are basically planted in green manure fields and fertile land, which was difficult to do during the period of small-scale, land-scarce advanced cooperatives. Baochang Commune in Haimen County originally planned to plant 3,000 mu of spring corn in sandy land this spring. Later, after studying that sandy land was not suitable for planting spring corn, the original sowing plan was adjusted, and more than 2,000 mu of spring corn were sown in production teams with better soil quality, resulting in an increase of more than two times. During the harvest season of early autumn crops this year, it was the critical moment for drought resistance. People's communes in various places have adjusted labor based on the principle of equivalent exchange, so that early autumn crops can be harvested in time, achieving high yields and bumper harvests.

    合理调整作物布局　充分发挥土地潜力
    江苏早秋总产量跃增七成
    全省平均单位面积产量增长一成以上
    新华社南京15日电　江苏省一千六百多万亩早秋作物大丰收。总产量比去年增加七成以上，平均单位面积产量比去年增长一成以上。
    今年江苏省早秋作物（包括单季早稻）面积比去年扩大了五百多万亩，其中早稻面积由去年的二百六十四万亩，扩大到三百四十三万亩。过去从未种过早稻的地区，今年也扩种了一部分。苏南的太湖地区，苏北的里下河地区等水稻产区，今年早稻生产季节掌握较好，做到早播早栽，合理密植，管理比往年更加精细，因此获得了更大的丰收。吴江县盛泽人民公社谢天大队由于季节抓得早，栽插质量好，田间管理精细，平均亩产量比去年增长三成多。丘陵山区的溧水县，八万亩早稻的平均亩产量也比去年增长二成。今年全省春玉米也比去年扩大了二百多万亩。沿海地带的南通专区，一百零八万亩玉米获得了大面积高产。春玉米丰产的主要经验是，因地制宜地贯彻了“八字宪法”。今年全省玉米田耕翻深度一般在六寸以上，比往年加深二寸左右，每亩施肥量约四十到五十担，其中精肥所占比重由去年的30％左右上升到50％以上，品种布局，种植密度也比往年更加合理，田间管理水平也大大提高。此外，大豆、高粱、谷子，也获得丰收。
    早秋作物的大丰收，显示了人民公社的优越性。公社化后，早秋作物能够在较大的范围内调整布局，合理安排茬口，因地种植，因此发挥了土地潜力。今年全省三百四十三万亩早稻，基本上都是种在绿肥田和土质肥沃的田里，这是在规模小、土地少的高级社时期难以办到的事情。海门县的包场公社，今年春天原来打算在沙土地带种春玉米三千亩，后来研究沙土地不适宜于种春玉米，就调整了原来的播种计划，将二千多亩春玉米播种在土质较好的生产队里，结果增产了两倍以上。今年早秋作物在收获时期，正是抗旱紧张关头，各地人民公社都根据等价交换的原则，在劳力上进行调剂，使得早秋作物及时收割，做到丰产丰收。
