Xinhua News Agency, 6th - The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee today issued a statement expressing its response to and support for the call by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council to hold a "Day of Struggle Against French Nuclear Testing in the Sahara" on September 7th. The statement said that this call reflects the common desire of the broad masses of African people and people around the world to oppose the threat of nuclear war, to demand the cessation of nuclear testing and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and to oppose colonialism and defend world peace.

The statement said that the French colonialists' carrying out nuclear tests in the Sahara will inevitably bring grave disasters to the African people, first and foremost seriously threatening the lives and safety of the people of North and West African countries neighboring the Sahara, and constituting a grave threat to world peace. Its purpose is to further intimidate and threaten the Algerian people and the people of other regions of Africa who are fighting heroically for national independence, in a vain attempt to maintain its colonial rule in Africa forever. This sinister plan of French colonialism has aroused opposition from the African people and people all over the world. The Chinese people solemnly condemn and protest France's nuclear tests in the Sahara, resolutely oppose France's colonial rule in Africa, and demand that France rescind its sinister plan to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara.

The statement emphasized that France's plan and preparations for nuclear weapons testing in the Sahara are supported by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and in particular by the governments of the United States and West Germany. U.S. imperialism, which has consistently pursued a policy of nuclear war threats, has not only stubbornly rejected the Soviet Union's proposals and all efforts to stop nuclear testing and ban nuclear weapons, but is also expanding nuclear weapons and missile bases around the world, and shipping large quantities of various nuclear weapons to many countries and regions. Recently, the United States signed an agreement with West Germany on nuclear weapons, turning West Germany into a bridgehead for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to possess atomic weapons; in the Far East, it is colluding with the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government in an attempt to turn Japan into a nuclear war base for U.S. aggression in the Far East. These sinister acts of U.S. imperialism seriously threaten the peace and security of Asia, Africa and the world, and have been strongly opposed and condemned by more and more people around the world.

The statement concluded by saying that the Chinese people have always supported the African people's struggle for national independence and against colonialism, and have always advocated the prohibition of nuclear weapons and opposition to the threat of nuclear war. We fully support the calls and resolutions of the World Peace Council, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, the All-African People's Conference, and the Conference of Independent African States against French nuclear testing in the Sahara or any part of Africa. We believe that today, with the socialist camp unprecedentedly strong, the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America to win and safeguard national independence rising daily, and the peace-loving people of the world increasingly awakened and united, as long as the people of all countries persist in their struggle, they will surely be able to smash the aggressive forces of imperialism. The Chinese people will forever stand with the African people and all peace-loving and justice-loving people of the world to fight together against the threat of nuclear war, against colonial rule, and for the cause of world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th - The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee today sent a telegram to the "Day of Struggle Against French Nuclear Testing in the Sahara" conference to be held by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council in Cairo, expressing its warm support and congratulations.

The telegram said that the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee extends warm congratulations to the conference, and expresses its high respect to the African people and all peace-loving people of all countries in the world for their efforts in demanding a halt to nuclear testing and opposing the threat of nuclear war through the conference.

The telegram said that the Chinese people firmly support the African people's struggle against nuclear weapons testing, and for winning and safeguarding national independence, and are willing to strengthen unity with the African people and peace-loving people all over the world to jointly safeguard world peace. We wish the "Day of Struggle Against French Nuclear Testing in the Sahara" conference to contribute to reflecting the strong desire of the Afro-Asian people to safeguard peace, strive for national independence, and oppose colonialism, and to promoting the unity of the Afro-Asian people and the movement against nuclear weapons testing.

    支持“反对法国在撒哈拉进行核试验斗争日”
    我亚非团结委员会发表声明
    指出法国的罪恶计划得到美国的支持
    新华社6日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表声明，表示响应和支持亚非人民团结理事会关于在9月7日举行“反对法国在撒哈拉进行核试验斗争日”的号召。声明说，这一号召反映了广大非洲人民和全世界人民反对核战争威胁，要求停止核试验和禁用核武器、反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平的共同愿望。
    声明说，法国殖民主义者在撒哈拉进行核试验，必将给非洲人民带来惨重的灾难，首先是严重地威胁邻近撒哈拉的北非和西非各国人民的生命与安全，并构成对世界和平的严重威胁。它的目的在于进一步恐吓和威胁正在为民族独立而英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民和非洲其他地区的人民，妄图永远维持它在非洲的殖民统治。法国殖民主义的这一罪恶计划已经激起非洲人民和全世界人民的反对。中国人民严正谴责和抗议法国在撒哈拉进行核试验，坚决反对法国在非洲的殖民统治，要求法国撤消它在撒哈拉进行核试验的罪恶计划。
    声明强调指出，法国在撒哈拉进行核武器试验的计划及准备工作，是有北大西洋公约集团的支持的，特别是得到了美国与西德政府的支持。一贯推行核战争威胁政策的美国帝国主义，不仅一直顽固地拒绝苏联关于停止核试验和禁用核武器的倡议和所作的一切努力，并且正在世界各地扩建核武器和导弹基地，向许多国家和地区大量运进各种核武器。最近，美国又与西德签订了关于核武器的协定，把西德变成北大西洋公约集团拥有原子武器的桥头堡；在远东，又与日本岸信介政府勾结，企图把日本变成美国侵略远东的核战争基地。美帝国主义的这些罪恶行为，严重威胁着亚洲、非洲和世界的和平与安全，受到了全世界愈来愈多的人们的强烈反对和谴责。
    声明最后说，中国人民一贯支持非洲人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争，一贯主张禁止核武器和反对核战争威胁。我们全力支持世界和平理事会、亚非人民团结理事会、全非人民大会以及非洲独立国家会议关于反对法国在撒哈拉或在非洲任何地区进行核试验的号召与决议。我们相信，在社会主义阵营空前强大，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争日益高涨，全世界爱好和平的人民日益觉醒和团结的今天，只要各国人民坚持斗争，就一定能够粉碎帝国主义侵略势力。中国人民将永远与非洲人民和全世界爱好和平和正义的人民一起，为反对核战争威胁、反对殖民统治和维护世界和平事业而共同奋斗。
    据新华社6日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天打电报给亚非人民团结理事会将在开罗举行的“反对法国在撒哈拉进行核试验斗争日”大会，表示热烈的支持和祝贺。
    电报说，中国亚非团结委员会谨向大会致以热烈的祝贺，并通过大会向非洲人民和世界各国一切爱好和平的人民在要求停止核试验和反对核战争威胁方面所作的努力，表示崇高的敬意。
    电报说，中国人民坚决支持非洲人民反对核武器试验、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，并愿同非洲人民和全世界爱好和平的人民加强团结，共同维护世界和平。祝“反对法国在撒哈拉进行核试验斗争日”大会，在反映亚非人民维护和平、争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的强烈愿望，并且在促进亚非人民团结和反对核武器试验的运动中作出贡献。
