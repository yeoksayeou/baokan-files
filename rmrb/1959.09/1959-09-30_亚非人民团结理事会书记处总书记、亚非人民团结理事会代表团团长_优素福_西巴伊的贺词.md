Congratulatory Message from Youssef El Sebai, Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization and Head of the Delegation of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization

    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, on the occasion of its visit to the People's Republic of China to participate in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, extends its warmest congratulations to the great Chinese people.

    We are no less joyful about this celebration than the Chinese people themselves. China is no longer the place where imperialists and their lackeys ran rampant as in the past decades. We sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on their glorious progress and the continuous success in building their country.

    In expressing our joy for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, the Secretariat of the Council not only expresses its own wishes but also the sincere wishes of the broad masses of the people of Asia and Africa. The broad masses of the people of Asia and Africa see their own achievements in the progress and strength of their 650 million Chinese brothers. They know that the increasingly developing China is their powerful friend and ally in the struggle against imperialism and its lackeys, and for freedom and peace.

    The Secretariat of the Council deeply believes that the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Movement is one of the strong pillars of the rapidly developing solidarity movement in the vast areas of Asia and Africa. In fact, as has been repeatedly said in the past, the Afro-Asian Solidarity Movement is the most powerful and broadest mass movement in world history, which makes the imperialists and their lackeys and reactionaries in various countries panic.

    It is precisely because the imperialists know that this solidarity movement will bring the final demise of their despicable and dirty system of plunder and robbery that they use every opportunity to slander and undermine this movement. The imperialists use all kinds of shameless means to launch a propaganda wave, wantonly slandering this movement. They deliberately distort and exaggerate some small things to undermine the rising solidarity of the Asian and African people.

    However, the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council is pleased to report to the great hundreds of millions of Chinese people that all these attempts to sabotage and attack our movement have failed. The Afro-Asian Solidarity Movement today represents and symbolizes the invincible and irresistible peaceful will of the masses of the Afro-Asian people. Since the historic Cairo Conference in December 1957, the solidarity movement of the Afro-Asian people has made significant progress in less than two years, inspired by the great spirit of unity and freedom.

    We are more willing to tell the Chinese people about the irresistible upsurge of the struggle for freedom on the African continent. Africa, which was once slandered by imperialism as the dark continent—where oppression and plunder were so severe that all oppressors in history paled in comparison—has now stood up to fight for its inherent rights of freedom and human dignity. The struggle for freedom is spreading like wildfire across the African continent. Imperialism has adopted the most barbaric means of suppression. Thousands of unarmed and peaceful African people have been brutally shot and massacred in various African countries, in Cameroon, Congo, Nyasaland, Rhodesia, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, and in fact throughout the African continent. Because imperialists implement the strictest censorship and all possible controls, the full tragic history of the African people has not yet been made public.

    In Algeria, the heroic Algerians are engaged in a great battle with French imperialism. In order to deal with the Algerians, French imperialism has invested more than 600,000 troops, equipped with weapons provided by the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this imperialist aggressive alliance. Like in Indochina, the Algerian war has brought France to the brink of a deep crisis, but in this crisis, U.S. President Eisenhower has once again aided France by supporting De Gaulle's plan to continue enslaving Algeria.

    But the people are invincible, and the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council, located in Cairo, has consistently followed this truth in its work for less than two years. It has led large-scale movements of the Afro-Asian people such as the "Get Out of Algeria Movement" and the "Movement Against Atomic Tests in the Sahara," and supported the struggles of people everywhere by commemorating "Cameroon Day," "Uganda Day," and "Oman Day."

    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council is pleased to report these activities to the Chinese people and thank them for their consistent support for our movement, and thank them for always responding to our requests and carrying out various commemorative activities. We believe that in the years to come, we will receive greater support and cooperation.

    While participating in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and wishing the Chinese people continuous success in the process of national prosperity and development, our Secretariat fully understands its other obligations. The historic Cairo Conference not only stipulated that we must strive for freedom, but also emphasized that freedom is only a means, and the goal to be achieved is to improve the living conditions of the masses of the Afro-Asian people who are deeply impoverished and suffering due to imperialist plunder and oppression. Improving the people's lives is the most important task, and the liberated Afro-Asian countries have been striving to achieve it with the greatest attention.

    These are important and urgent tasks facing every country, and every country is completing them according to its own wisdom and national traditions. In this regard, the countries of the Afro-Asian family naturally want to learn from each other's experiences. These countries are watching with admiration as their Chinese brothers successfully solve problems related to eliminating unemployment, eradicating illiteracy, developing agriculture, and achieving industrialization, among others. The achievements China has made in solving the food problem and ending the exploitation and enslavement of peasants have made a deep impression on the Afro-Asian people. China's experience provides valuable lessons for the countries of the Afro-Asian family, and they will make good use of these experiences in their future development. This is natural.

    The famous Bandung Conference principles, which were declared again at the Cairo Conference, emphasize the basic principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These principles were in fact laid down in the famous Five Principles Declaration of the Chinese and Indian Premiers. The Five Principles, born from the common wisdom of the two great ancient nations of China and India, show the whole world a new overall prospect of peace and progress for mankind.

    The Secretariat of the Council is very pleased and honored to be able to participate in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We express our gratitude to the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee for inviting us to participate in this great festival. We bring the friendship and solidarity of the Afro-Asian people to the Chinese people. The solidarity of the Afro-Asian people is an indestructible force, and the Chinese people are the most important part of this force. We congratulate the new China. (Attached picture)

    亚非人民团结理事会书记处总书记、亚非人民团结理事会代表团团长
    优素福·西巴伊的贺词
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处这次访问中华人民共和国，参加开国十周年庆祝大会，谨此向伟大的中国人民致最热烈的祝贺。
    我们对这次庆祝的欢欣，不亚于中国人民自己。中国已经不是以前几十年间帝国主义者及其走狗们猖狂的地方了。我们衷心祝贺中国人民的光荣的进步和建设他们的国家中不断获得的成功。
    在表达对建国十周年庆祝的欢欣时候，理事会书记处不仅表达了自己的祝愿并且表达了亚非广大人民群众的衷心祝愿。亚非广大人民群众从六亿五千万中国兄弟的进步与力量中，看到了自己的成就，他们知道日益发展的中国是他们为反对帝国主义和它的走狗、为争取自由与和平的强有力的朋友和联盟。
    理事会书记处深深地认为中国的亚非团结运动，是亚非广大地区迅速发展的团结运动的坚强支柱之一。事实上，正如过去一再说过的一样，亚非团结运动是世界历史上最强大和最广泛的群众运动，它使帝国主义者以及它在各国的走狗和反动派惶恐不堪。
    正是因为帝国主义者知道这个团结运动将要给他们的卑鄙、龌龊的掠夺与抢劫制度带来最后的复灭，所以他们利用一切机会要诬蔑和破坏这一运动。帝国主义者利用各种无耻的手段掀起一个宣传浪潮，大肆诬蔑这个运动。他们把一些细小的事情故意加以歪曲夸大，用来破坏日益高涨的亚非人民的团结。
    但是，亚非团结理事会书记处高兴地向伟大的亿万中国人民报告：所有这一切破坏和打击我们运动的企图都已失败，亚非团结运动今天代表和象征着亚非人民群众的不可征服和不可抗拒的和平意志。自从1957年12月有历史性的开罗会议以来，在不到两年时间，由于为团结和自由的伟大精神所鼓舞，亚非人民的团结运动已取得了有意义的进展。
    我们更愿意把在非洲大陆上进行着的不可抗拒的争取自由的高涨告诉中国人民。过去被帝国主义诬蔑为黑暗大陆的非洲——它被压迫和被掠夺的程度使历史上的一切压迫者都黯然失色——现在已经站起来，争取它固有的自由权利和人类尊严。争取自由的斗争像燎原之火一样蔓延于非洲大陆。帝国主义采取了最野蛮的手段进行镇压，成千的手无寸铁的和平的非洲人民，在非洲各国，在喀麦隆、刚果、尼亚萨兰、罗的西尼、南非、怯尼亚、乌干达，事实上在整个非洲大陆，被残酷地枪杀和屠杀。因为帝国主义者实行最严厉的新闻检查和一切可能的控制，非洲人民惨痛的全部历史还未公诸于世。
    在阿尔及利亚，英勇的阿尔及利亚人正在和法国帝国主义进行伟大的战斗。为了对付阿尔及利亚人，法帝国主义投入了六十多万人的兵力，他们是用美国供给北大西洋公约组织这一帝国主义侵略联盟的武器装备起来的。像在印度支那一样，阿尔及利亚的战争已经把法国引向深刻危机的边缘，但在这次危机中，美国总统艾森豪威尔又再一次通过支持继续奴役阿尔及利亚的戴高乐计划来援助法国。
    但是，人民是不可战胜的，而设在开罗的亚非团结理事会书记处在它不到二年的工作中就是经常遵循这一真理的。它领导过“滚出阿尔及利亚运动”和“反对在撒哈拉进行原子试验运动”等大规模的亚非人民运动，并且通过纪念“喀麦隆日”、“乌干达日”、“阿曼日”等来支持各地人民的斗争。
    亚非团结理事会书记处高兴地将这些活动向中国人民报告，并感谢他们对于我们的运动一贯的支持，感谢他们一直响应我们的要求，进行各项纪念活动。我们相信，在未来的岁月中，我们将获得更大的支持和合作。
    在参加中国人民建国十周年庆祝大会，并预祝中国人民在走向国家繁荣和发展的进程中不断获得成功的时候，我们书记处完全明白它所负的其他义务。具有历史意义的开罗会议不仅规定了必须争取自由，而且强调了自由只是一个手段，应该达到的目的是必须使深受帝国主义的掠夺和压迫因而处于极端贫困和痛苦境地的亚非人民群众的生活条件得到提高。提高人民生活是最重要的任务，获得解放的亚非国家已经以最大的注意力来实现它。
    这些是摆在每一个国家面前的重要而迫切的任务，每一个国家正在按照各自的智慧和民族传统来完成它们。在这方面，亚非大家庭的各个国家自然要相互学习经验。这些国家怀着钦佩的心情看到中国弟兄成功地解决了消灭失业、扫除文盲、发展农业和实现工业化以及其他有关问题。中国在解决粮食问题和结束农民受剥削受奴役的状况方面所取得的成就在亚非人民中间产生了深刻的印象。中国的经验给予亚非大家庭各国以宝贵的教训，他们在他们将来的发展中将很好地利用这些经验。这是很自然的。
    开罗会议上再一次宣布的著名的万隆会议的原则，强调互相尊重领土主权的完整，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利和和平共处的基本原则。这些原则事实上在中印总理有名的五项原则宣言里就已经奠定了。产生于中印二大古老民族共同智慧的五项原则向全世界显示出和平和进步人类新的整个的前景。
    理事会书记处能够参加中华人民共和国建国十周年的庆祝大会，感到非常愉快和荣幸。我们对于中国亚非团结委员会邀请我们参加这个伟大的节日表示感谢。我们把亚非人民的友谊和团结带给中国人民。亚非人民的团结是一种不可摧毁的力量，中国人民就是这个力量的最重要部分。我们向新中国祝贺。（附图片）
