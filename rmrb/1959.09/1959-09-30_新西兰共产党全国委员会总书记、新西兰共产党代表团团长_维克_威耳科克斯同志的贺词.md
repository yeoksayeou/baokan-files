Comrade Chairman, Comrades:

On the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of your great revolutionary victory, I am very happy to convey the congratulations of the Communist Party of New Zealand to this congress and to all the Chinese people. The Communist Party of New Zealand has been watching your great struggles since the founding of the Communist Party of China with respect and admiration. We have happily watched the first Soviets you established in Jiangxi, we have watched your historic Long March to Yan'an, and the War of Resistance Against Japan you waged. When you defeated the reactionary Kuomintang in 1949, thereby forever crushing the imperialist forces in your country on the mainland, we were very excited.

Today, you are celebrating the tenth anniversary of this victory. You are celebrating this tenth anniversary in an era of victorious socialist construction in your country, at a time when the lives of the broad masses of the people are improving day by day, the development of China's national economy has achieved great victories, and your second five-year plan will certainly be completed in just two years. The rapid development of industry has led to a stronger socialist foundation, and at the same time, in the process of building socialism, the significance of the development of rural people's communes is becoming increasingly apparent.

Indeed, you have entered the socialist spring through your sacrifices and struggles under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. You are on the eve of the socialist summer, which will produce the brilliant communist society of the future.

Today, world imperialism is dying. The impact of the imminent death of world imperialism has been felt in New Zealand. The lives of the working people, small farmers, small merchants, and freelancers in New Zealand are becoming more and more difficult. Monopoly capital comprehensively controls our economy. As a result, the rich get richer at the expense of the people's living standards, and the masses find the burden of the increasingly severe capitalist crisis firmly on their shoulders.

In this situation, more and more people in New Zealand are friendly to your socialist country and its achievements.

Our struggle against imperialism and for the establishment of a socialist New Zealand remains a difficult one. However, inspired by the great example of the Communist Party of China, inspired by your victory and the great example of the socialist victories achieved daily by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, we also look forward to victory with confidence.

Celebrating the tenth anniversary of your liberation is not only your business, it also marks another milestone on the road of progress for mankind.

Long live the glorious Chinese people!
Long live the Communist Party of China! (Picture attached)

    新西兰共产党全国委员会总书记、新西兰共产党代表团团长
    维克·威耳科克斯同志的贺词主席同志，同志们：
    在庆祝你们伟大的革命胜利十周年的时候，我能够向这次大会和全体中国人民转达新西兰共产党的祝贺，感到非常高兴。新西兰共产党一直怀着尊敬和钦佩的心情注视着你们在中国共产党成立以来的年代里所进行的伟大斗争。我们曾高兴地注视过你们最早在江西建立的第一批苏维埃，我们曾注视着你们走向延安的具有历史意义的长征和你们进行的抗日战争。当你们在1949年战胜反动的国民党，从而在大陆上永远粉碎了你们国家里的帝国主义势力的时候，我们的心情非常兴奋。
    今天，你们正在庆祝这一胜利的十周年。你们是在你们国家社会主义建设胜利的时代，在广大人民群众的生活日益改善、中国国民经济发展取得了巨大胜利、你们的第二个五年计划肯定将在短短的两年时间内完成的这样一个时期，庆祝这一胜利的十周年的。工业的迅速发展导致了更加强大的社会主义的基础，同时在建设社会主义的过程中，农村人民公社的发展的意义愈来愈加明显。
    的确，你们已经通过你们的牺牲和斗争，在中国共产党的领导下，进入了社会主义的春天。你们正处在社会主义的夏天的前夕，这个社会主义的夏天将产生未来的光辉灿烂的共产主义社会。
    今天，世界帝国主义正在死亡。在新西兰已经感到了世界帝国主义即将死亡的影响。新西兰的劳动人民、小农、小商人和自由职业者的生活愈来愈困难。垄断资本全面地控制着我们的经济。因此，富者在牺牲群众的生活水平的情况下变得更富，群众发现日益加剧的资本主义危机的重担牢牢地压在他们的肩上。
    在这种情况下，新西兰愈来愈多的人都友好地注视着你们的社会主义国家和它的成就。
    我们反对帝国主义、争取建立社会主义新西兰的斗争仍旧是一场艰巨的斗争。但是，在中国共产党的伟大榜样的鼓舞下，在你们的胜利和苏联及其他社会主义国家每天取得的社会主义胜利的伟大榜样的鼓舞下，我们也满怀信心地期望着胜利。
    庆祝你们解放的十周年不仅是你们的事情，它还标志着进步人类前进的道路上的另一个里程碑。
    光荣的中国人民万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！（附图片）
