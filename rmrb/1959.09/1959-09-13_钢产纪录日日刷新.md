Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 12th – Anshan Iron and Steel Company created the highest ten-day steel production record since the start of operations in the first ten days of September, with an average daily steel production increase of more than 1,800 tons compared to the first ten days of August. The production plans for steel, steel products, steel billets, metallurgical coke, and other major products were all overfulfilled in the first ten days of the month. Among them, more than 5,300 tons of high-quality steel were produced above the state plan. Among the 24 major production plants and mines in the company, 16 completed or overfulfilled the plan for the first ten days ahead of schedule.

The employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's various plants and mines are determined to create higher production achievements in September to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Under the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and the company Party committee, they widely promoted the experience of technical performance competitions among the workers of five large fixed open-hearth furnaces, strengthened production collaboration, broke through a series of key production bottlenecks, and continuously climbed to new peaks in production levels.

The employees of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, who completed the plan for the first ten days relatively well, have conducted continuous joint technical performances of various work types since the beginning of September under the leadership of the Party Secretary and Plant Director, greatly shortening the operation time of each process such as charging, furnace repair, melting, molten iron transfer, and ingot casting. On the first day of the performance competition, the smelting time of each furnace of steel was shortened by 41 minutes compared to the plan, breaking through the steel production plan level for the day in one fell swoop. Because the technical performance competition rapidly improved the technical level of workers and solved some long-unresolved key production problems, the daily steel production of this plant increased by 477 tons compared to the same period in August during the first ten days of the month. In the past, the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant needed five to six hours to process a tap hole; in the recent technical performance competition, Dong Junying, an assistant worker in Team B, created a new record of processing the tap hole in 15 minutes, improving efficiency by nearly 20 times. After Dong Junying's advanced experience was promoted throughout the plant, the time for processing tap holes was greatly shortened. In the first ten days of September, this plant produced more than 310 tons of steel per day compared to the same period in August. The employees of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces continued to carry out technical performance competitions in depth. In the first ten days of September, the smelting time of each furnace of steel was shortened by one hour and twenty-one minutes compared to the same period in August, and the open-hearth furnace operating rate was greatly improved, thus overproducing more than 2,300 tons of high-quality steel and completing the production plan for the first ten days. The various rolling mills, sintering plants, chemical plants, and many other factories have also achieved good results after widely carrying out technical performances.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 12th – The employees of the thirteen rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have put forward new production increase targets: to increase the production of high-quality steel products by 32,000 tons in September as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day. In the first ten days of September, they have already overproduced more than 5,300 tons, completing the national steel production plan ahead of schedule, and launched the first shot in the September battle to seize steel.

The employees of these thirteen rolling mills have already increased production by more than 118,000 tons of steel products compared to the national plan in July and August, exceeding the proposed target of increasing steel production by 100,000 tons in the third quarter that they put forward at the beginning of August. Entering September, inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they further launched a vigorous production increase and economy campaign. In the competition, the employees of each plant, in combination with key production issues, vigorously carried out technical performances and production collaboration, widely promoted advanced experiences, and continuously improved production levels. The Party Secretary of the No. 1 Medium Plate Plant took command, vigorously grasped production, organized workers to conduct technical performance competitions in shifts, and promptly promoted new experiences emerging in the competition, thus the production level rose steadily. The Team A workers achieved "full house red" in production for five consecutive days in the technical performance competition, and all indicators such as output, quality, variety, and cost exceeded the plan; the Team B workers were even more outstanding, continuously creating seven new production records since the beginning of the first ten days of the month. From the 1st to the 9th, the entire plant increased production by more than 1,100 tons of high-quality steel plates compared to the national plan, completing the plan for the first ten days one day ahead of schedule. The employees of the rolling section of the No. 1 Thin Plate Plant promoted the new steel rolling operation method created by the Team A workers in the technical performance, increasing production efficiency by about 20%; at the same time, they vigorously grasped equipment maintenance, reduced equipment accidents, and thus the entire plant completed the national production plan by more than 10% from the 1st to the 9th. The No. 1 Primary Rolling Plant, the No. 2 Medium Plate Plant, the No. 2 Thin Plate Plant, and the Plate Rolling Plant also greatly improved production since September due to the in-depth development of technical performance competitions and the vigorous focus on key production issues.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th – Beijing City overfulfilled the steel production plan for the first ten days of September, with an output increase of 41% compared to the first ten days of August, and the quality also improved compared to August.

The steelmaking workshops of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Steel Plant, and Special Steel Plant, the three main steelmaking units, carried out a vigorous counterpart competition and all overfulfilled the steelmaking plan for the first ten days of the month. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company continuously improved technical operations, and at the same time, focusing on steel production, vigorously grasped the "front, back, left, and right," including raw materials, transportation, equipment, and the supply of wind, water, electricity, and gas. The steel output in the first ten days of September increased by 21.4% compared to the same period in August. The daily production records of Beijing Steel Plant and Special Steel Plant were repeatedly refreshed in the first ten days of the month. The No. 2 Converter Workshop of Beijing Steel Plant averaged 56 heats per day in August. On September 7, the entire workshop launched a steel-grabbing battle to produce 100 heats per day, and as a result, they produced 106 heats, creating the highest daily production record since the establishment of the plant. In the competition, the three main steelmaking units also exchanged experiences with each other and sent outstanding technicians and dispatchers to help their competitors improve furnace age and improve workshop dispatching work.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th – Although the employees of the Shanghai steel front encountered a major wind, rain, and tide in the first ten days of September, and many converters, open-hearth furnaces, and rolling mill equipment were under repair, the average daily output of steel and steel products still increased by more than 32% and 41% respectively compared to the first ten days of August.

The employees of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, who hoisted the red flag of the nationwide leap forward in converter steelmaking, overcame the various difficulties of smelting rimming steel under the slogan of "eliminating low production in every shift and smelting good steel in every furnace," so that steel production continued to remain above 300 tons per day. By the 10th, this plant had overfulfilled the production task for the first ten days of the month.

The heavy wind and rain on September 4th and 5th posed a great threat to the production of Shanghai No. 3 and No. 5 Steel Plants, which are located on the banks of the Huangpu River. The heavy rain poured down, and the tide rose sharply, and the material yards of the two plants were full of accumulated water, and some converter furnace pits and steel pouring slabs leaked water. The transportation and steelmaking workers of the two plants launched a tenacious struggle against the heavy wind, rain, and water. Under the slogan of "No matter how heavy the rain, ensure the converter is well-fed," the material transport workers sent materials into the workshop day and night; the steelmaking workers also built dikes around the slabs and furnace pits, clearing the water out of the pits bucket by bucket, so that the furnaces continued to produce normally.

A tense battle was also launched on the rolling mill front. The rolling mills and cooling beds of the fifth workshop of Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant were all producing inside temporary bamboo sheds. When the heavy wind and rain struck, there was water everywhere in the bamboo sheds. The workers, wearing raincoats and rubber boots, persevered in rolling steel production against the wind and rain. The rolling workers of the No. 1 branch of the New Shanghai Steel Plant encountered a relatively difficult flat steel to roll at the beginning of September, but the youth team and the Team A rolling workers of this plant cooperated with each other, creating five consecutive high-yield records in ten days. The output of each team was higher than the previous team. By the 10th, they had overfulfilled the rolling mill plan for the first ten days of the month by more than 160 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th – The 100,000 steel industry workers in Chongqing are working harder and harder, creating new achievements almost every day since September. Steel production on September 3 was 591 tons more than on the 1st, and on September 5 it was 245 tons more than on the 3rd; on September 10, the city's steel output broke through the 3,000-ton mark, creating the highest daily production level since this year. The average daily steel output of the city in the first ten days of September increased by 34% compared to the average daily output in August.

After earnestly studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party , the employees of various steel plants in Chongqing unanimously expressed their determination to complete the entire month's production plan three to five days ahead of schedule in September to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day. In the past ten days, new records and new achievements have emerged one after another. From September 1 to 9, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company alone saw 483 new records. At the beginning of September, the employees of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's large open-hearth furnace plant grasped the major key to production of shortening smelting time, organized technical performances throughout the plant, and launched a counterpart competition between furnaces and between shifts, thus continuously creating new smelting records of 7 hours and 44 minutes, 7 hours and 38 minutes, and 7 hours and 25 minutes, shortening the smelting time by one to two hours compared to the past. The open-hearth furnace workshop of Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant, which originally had relatively backward production, gradually increased the furnace charging amount to more than 55 tons for the small open-hearth furnaces throughout the workshop, quickly catching up with the originally more advanced small open-hearth furnace plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, as some leading cadres overcame right-leaning slack emotions and workers universally launched counterpart competitions. In the enthusiastic counterpart competition, the steelworkers also further strengthened mutual cooperation.

    鞍钢各厂矿职工9月份决心创造更高的生产成就，迎接国庆十周年。他们在中共鞍山市委和公司党委领导下，普遍推广了五座大型固定式平炉职工开展技术表演赛的经验，加强了生产大协作，突破了一系列的生产关键，使生产水平不断跨上新的高峰。
    完成上旬计划较好的第一炼钢厂职工，在党委书记、厂长带头下，9月初以来连续进行了各个工种的联合技术大表演，使装料、补炉、熔化、兑铁水、铸锭等各个工序的操作时间都大为缩短。在表演赛的第一天，平炉每炉钢的冶炼时间就比计划缩短了四十一分钟，一举突破了当天的钢产量计划水平。由于技术表演赛迅速地提高了工人的技术水平，攻破了长期没有解决的一些生产关键问题，这个厂上旬每天的钢产量比8月同期增产了四百七十七吨。第二炼钢厂过去处理一次出钢口需要五、六个小时；在最近的技术表演赛中，乙班代理一助手董俊英创造了用十五分钟处理完出钢口的新纪录，提高效率近二十倍。董俊英的先进经验在全厂推广后，处理出钢口的时间都大为缩短。9月上旬，这个厂每天比8月同期多产钢三百一十多吨。五座大型固定式平炉的职工，继续深入开展技术表演赛，9月上旬每炉钢的冶炼时间比8月同期又缩短了一小时二十一分钟，平炉作业率大大提高，因此超产二千三百多吨优质钢完成了上旬生产计划。各轧钢厂、烧结厂、化工厂和其他许多工厂，广泛开展技术表演后，也取得了良好的效果。
    新华社鞍山12日电　鞍钢十三个轧钢厂的职工又提出新的增产指标：在9月份增产优质钢材三万二千吨，向国庆十周年献礼。9月上旬，他们已超产五千三百多吨提前完成了国家钢材生产计划，打响了9月夺取钢材大战的第一炮。
    这十三个轧钢厂的职工在7、8两月已比国家计划增产了十一万八千多吨钢材，超额实现了他们在8月初提出的，在第三季度增产十万吨钢材的倡议指标。进入9月份，他们在党的八届八中全会伟大号召鼓舞下，进一步掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约竞赛。在竞赛中，各厂职工结合生产关键，大搞技术表演和生产协作，广泛推广先进经验，不断地提高生产水平。第一中板厂党委书记挂帅，狠抓生产，组织工人班班开展技术表演赛，及时地推广了竞赛中出现的新经验，因而生产水平节节上升。甲班工人在技术表演竞赛中，连续五天实现了生产“满堂红”，产量、质量、品种、成本等各项指标，都超额完成了计划；乙班工人更为出色，上旬以来，连续创造了七次生产新纪录。全厂1日到9日，就比国家计划增产了一千一百多吨优质钢板，提前一天完成了上旬计划。第一薄板厂轧钢工段职工在技术表演中，推广了甲班工人创造的新的轧钢操作方法，生产效率提高了20％左右；同时大抓设备检修，减少了设备事故，因而全厂1日到9日超过10％完成了国家生产计划。第一初轧厂、第二中板厂、第二薄板厂、轧板厂等，也由于深入开展了技术表演赛，狠抓生产关键，9月以来，生产都有很大提高。
    新华社12日讯　北京市9月上旬钢的生产计划超额完成，产量比8月上旬增长41％，质量也比8月份提高。
    石景山钢铁公司炼钢车间、北京钢厂、特殊钢厂三个主要炼钢单位，轰轰烈烈地开展对口竞赛，都超额完成了上旬炼钢计划。石景山钢铁公司不断改进技术操作，同时围绕钢铁生产，大抓“前后左右”，即包括原料、运输、设备和风、水、电、气的供应等工作，9月上旬的钢产量比8月同期提高了21.4％。北京钢厂和特殊钢厂上旬的日产纪录一再被刷新。北京钢厂第二转炉车间8月份平均每日吹炼五十六炉，9月7日全车间发起日产百炉的夺钢大战，结果炼了一百零六炉，创造了建厂以来的最高日产纪录。三个主要炼钢单位在竞赛中，还互相交流经验，互派优秀的技术工人和调度人员帮助竞赛对手提高炉龄，改善车间调度工作。
    新华社上海12日电　上海钢铁战线职工在9月上旬虽然遇到了一次大风大雨大潮，不少转炉、平炉和轧钢设备又处在检修的情况下，但是把钢和钢材的平均日产量依然分别比8月上旬提高32％和41％以上。
    高举全国转炉炼钢全面跃进红旗的上钢六厂的职工们，在“班班消灭低产，炉炉炼出好钢”的口号下，克服了炼沸腾钢的种种困难，使钢产量继续保持在日产三百吨以上。到10日止，这个厂已超额完成了上旬的生产任务。
    9月4日、5日的大风大雨，给地处黄浦江边的上钢三厂和五厂的生产带来了很大威胁。大雨倾盆而下，潮水又趁势上升，两个厂的材料场上满是积水，有些转炉的炉坑里、浇钢的平板上也漏进水去。这两个厂的运输和炼钢工人，同大风大雨大水展开了顽强的搏斗。运料工人在“不论雨水多大，保证转炉吃饱吃好”的口号下，日夜不停地把料送进车间；炼钢工人们也在平板、炉坑周围筑起了一道道堤坝，把坑里的水一桶桶地清除出去，使炉子照常生产。
    轧钢战线上也展开了一场紧张的搏斗。上钢二厂五车间的轧机和冷床等设备，都是在临时搭的竹棚内进行生产的。当大风雨袭来的时候，竹棚内到处是水。工人们穿着雨衣套鞋，顶着风雨，坚持轧钢生产。新沪钢铁厂一分厂的轧钢工人，9月初碰上了一种比较难轧的扁钢，但是这个厂的青年班和甲班轧钢工人互相协作，在十天内接连创造了五次高产纪录，产量一班比一班高，到10日止超额一百六十多吨完成了上旬的轧钢计划。
    新华社重庆12日电　重庆市十万钢铁工业职工越干越猛，9月以来几乎每天都创造新的成绩。9月3日比1日多产五百九十一吨钢，5日又比3日多产二百四十五吨钢；9月10日，全市钢产量突破三千吨大关，创造了今年以来日产水平的最高纪录。全市9月上旬钢的平均日产量，比8月份平均日产量增长34％。
