Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 3rd: Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" and "Ta Kung Pao" have published editorials and commentaries for several days, supporting the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

	"Wen Wei Po" published an editorial on August 28th, stating that the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party are the triumphal song of the Chinese people's Great Leap Forward and also the call for the Chinese people to continue the Great Leap Forward. After discussing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year and the current economic situation, the editorial said: "With the achievements and experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, with the existence and consolidation and development of the People's Communes, with the foundation of a 65% increase in the total industrial output value in the first half of this year, and with the People's Communes achieving even greater agricultural harvests than last year in fighting drought, the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, will victoriously realize the great goals of the Eighth Plenary Session with soaring enthusiasm."

	On the 1st, this newspaper published another editorial specifically discussing the victory of the People's Communes. The editorial said that the large-scale establishment of People's Communes in rural China, for a period of one year, has caused epoch-making changes in China and created a brand-new situation. Our country was able to achieve a great harvest last autumn and simultaneously engage in large-scale steel production; this summer, we were able to overcome natural disasters and still have abundant harvests, which shows the power of the People's Communes. The editorial said that U.S. imperialism hates our People's Communes so much because the People's Communes will make the new China more consolidated and stronger, further shattering the American masters' aggressive fantasies.

	"Ta Kung Pao" published a commentary on August 31st, saying: "The fate of the People's Communes is ultimately not determined by those who chant curses, but by the more than 500 million farmers. The farmers have recognized its benefits through personal experience, and it will never collapse."

    香港“文汇报”和“大公报”发表论文指出
    八中全会决议是继续跃进号角
    新华社香港3日电　香港“文汇报”和“大公报”连日发表社论和评论，拥护中共八届八中全会的公报和决议。
    “文汇报”8月28日发表社论说，中共八届八中全会的公报和决议，是中国人民大跃进的凯歌，也是中国人民继续跃进的号角。社论论述了去年大跃进的成就和当前的经济形势后说：“有了去年大跃进的成绩和经验，有了人民公社的存在和巩固发展，有了今年上半年工业总产值增加65％的基础，有了人民公社在抗旱中获得比去年大丰收更大的农业收成，全国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，将以冲天干劲胜利实现八中全会的伟大目标。”
    1日，这家报纸又发表社论专门论述人民公社的胜利。社论说，中国农村大办人民公社，为时一年，已在中国引起了划时代的大变化，创造了一个崭新的局面。我国去秋能够一手大丰收，一手大办钢铁；今夏又能战胜天灾，依然五谷丰登，这就说明了人民公社的威力。社论说，美帝国主义对我国人民公社如此深恶痛绝，这是因为人民公社将使新中国更巩固，更强大，进一步粉碎了美国老爷的侵略幻想。
    “大公报”8月31日发表评论说：“人民公社的命运，究竟不决定于那些念咒的人，而是决定于五亿多农民。农民以切身经验认识了它的好处，它就怎么也垮不了。”
