Serving the Steel Industry Better
Zhou Ren, Director of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

We metallurgical and ceramic research workers directly serve the steel industry. We deeply feel that the unprecedented great leap forward in the steel industry last year was the result of implementing the Party's General Line and the result of the mass campaign for steelmaking by the whole people. Developing steel production, with large-scale iron and steel complexes as the mainstay, is of course necessary, but large enterprises require large investments and take a long time to build, and generally require reserves of more than 100 million tons to build. During the Great Leap Forward last year, while continuing to build large-scale iron and steel enterprises, our Party adopted the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods and combining large, medium, and small-scale enterprises, greatly accelerating the development speed and production level of the steel industry. Facts have proven that this is completely correct and in line with China's actual situation. We must resolutely refute those right-leaning opportunists who falsely claim that our mass steelmaking was "not worth the loss."

At present, the metallurgy, silicate, and technical departments of our institute are formulating further leap forward plans in accordance with the policy of scientific research serving production, combining the current problems in steel industry production and the requirements of production units. While strengthening laboratory research work, researchers from various departments are also going deep into factories and workshops to help discover and solve technical problems in production in a timely manner. We are determined to complete dozens of new research projects by the end of September as a gift to the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    更好地为钢铁工业服务
    中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所所长　周仁
    我们冶金陶瓷研究工作者是直接为钢铁工业服务的，我们深深感到：去年钢铁工业空前巨大的跃进是贯彻党的总路线的结果，是全民大炼钢铁的结果。发展钢铁生产，以大型钢铁联合企业为主当然是必要的，但大型企业投资大、建设慢，而且一般必须有一亿吨以上的储藏量才能建设。去年大跃进中，我们党在继续兴建大型钢铁企业的同时，采取了洋土并举和大中小相结合的方针，大大加快了钢铁工业的发展速度和生产水平，事实证明，这是完全正确的，是符合我国实际情况的。对于那些胡说我们大炼钢铁“得不偿失”的右倾机会主义分子，必须给以坚决的驳斥。
    现在，我们研究所的冶金、硅酸盐和技术等部门正根据科学研究为生产服务的方针，结合当前钢铁工业生产中存在的问题和生产单位的要求，制订进一步的跃进规划。在加强实验室研究工作的同时，各部门研究人员还深入工厂车间，及时帮助发现和解决生产中的技术问题。我们决心在9月底完成数十项新的研究项目，作为向伟大国庆十周年的献礼。
