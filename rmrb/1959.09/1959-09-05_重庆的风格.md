    Chongqing's Style
    Zeng Ke

    Cities, like people, possess unique styles due to the natural conditions they inhabit and their distinct development histories. Anyone who encounters a city forms an impression. The longer one lives with her, sharing her hardships and joys, the deeper one's understanding of her style becomes, drawn not only to her appearance and features but also to her inherent beauty.

    Chongqing, the mountain city embraced by the mighty arms of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, attracts new acquaintances and old friends alike with her unique beauty and distinctive style, leaving them with unforgettable memories, doesn't she?

    Over the past decade, many who lived with her before and during the War of Resistance, sharing suffering and fighting together, have sought every opportunity to visit her again. Some, due to busy work schedules, have been unable to come for the time being, but wherever they are, they eagerly inquire about the changes in the mountain city from those who have been there, as if concerned for their long-separated hometown. Many foreign friends, driven by curiosity, come to explore the secrets of the mountain city's soaring development and to seek out the remnants of the final collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. When people see the mountain city, covered in greenery like a peninsula, the forest of factory chimneys in Jiangbei and Nan'an, and the verdant terraced fields surrounding the city like brocade, from planes, ships, or car windows, they can't help but exclaim in admiration: "What a poetic city, what fertile fields, truly a natural garden!"

    Countless poets have sung praises of the mountain city's enchanting night scenes, numerous painters have displayed their masterful skills in capturing the thick and light mists that shroud the city year-round, and countless musicians have extracted lively notes from the roaring river tides and the boatmen's cries... These are all alluring aspects of the mountain city. However, the primary factor shaping her unique style is that Chongqing is a city with a long history, opened up and built by the people through arduous labor; a city where the people endured the most brutal enslavement and longest rule, yet waged tenacious and heroic struggles, leaving behind glorious victories; and a city that is now engaged in socialist construction with abundant vitality, transforming her into an even more beautiful place.

    I suddenly recall a small incident during a visit to Bulgaria in September 1956. One day, I went to Veliko Tarnovo, once the capital of Bulgaria. It is also a mountain city. I visited the city's history museum. Upon entering the first exhibition hall, I encountered the white-haired old curator introducing the characteristics of Veliko Tarnovo to the audience. He began by saying that mountain cities are few and far between in the world. He listed some famous mountain cities, praising the people who built them for their exceptional perseverance and courage. At this point, the Bulgarian comrade accompanying us interjected, "Old Curator, what a coincidence, let me introduce you to this friend from the Chinese mountain city of Chongqing!" Upon hearing this, the old curator immediately extended a warm hand and repeatedly said things indicating that he knew something about the city and had questions to ask. The companion, fluent in Beijing Mandarin learned during his four years of study in China, translated for me and then said to the old curator, "Yes, it is the place of Chiang Kai-shek's last rule, where Zhou Enlai and the underground organization of the Chinese Communist Party led the people in a long-term struggle during the Anti-Japanese War, and where Mao Zedong went from Yan'an for peace talks." The old curator laughed heartily, indicating that he was familiar with all of this. He immediately added Chongqing to his introduction of mountain cities with a respectful tone, repeatedly saying, "Good, another mountain city, and a city of struggle!"

    From this small experience, we already know that the struggle and construction of the people of Chongqing are not only of concern to the people of China but are also of concern to friends on the banks of the Danube! So, let us look at her past and present:

    We can fully imagine the magnificent spirit of the people of Chongqing when, during the Qin Dynasty, they split mountains and cut rocks, initially building the city of "Jiangzhou" (Chongqing's earliest name) on the mountainside. Before liberation, her fate was no different from that of other cities in the motherland, leaving behind the ugly and humiliating marks of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. From the time she was opened as a treaty port after the traitorous Qing government and imperialism signed the "Chefoo Convention" and the "Treaty of Shimonoseki," her port was filled with warships flying foreign flags. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionary government made Chongqing its "provisional capital," relying on American spy agencies to exploit, persecute, and massacre the people, leaving behind countless bloody debts. But the people of the mountain city, under the leadership of the Party, wrote a glorious and brilliant epic of struggle. We can see even more clearly the earth-shaking changes in the mountain city over the past ten years since liberation, and together with the people of the mountain city, we are using our labor to create new historical pages.

    In the ten years since liberation, Chongqing's total industrial output value has increased thirteenfold compared to 1949, and the population has grown from 1.2 million at the time of liberation to 4.5 million. In addition to the original seven districts of Chongqing city, Jiangbei, Nan'an, Nantong Mining Area, and Beibei, the jurisdiction has also added the three counties of Qijiang, Changshou, and Ba County, with an area of approximately 7,525 square kilometers.

    In addition to industrial production, the changes in Chongqing's municipal construction are the most significant. Inheriting the spirit of perseverance of their ancestors in splitting mountains and cutting rocks, the people of Chongqing have moved mountain after mountain and leveled hill after hill in the past decade, building countless factories on the mountain foundations, and constructing the Temple of Heaven-shaped auditorium that can accommodate 5,000 people; the Datianwan Square that can accommodate 150,000 people; and the stadium that can accommodate 45,000 spectators. The roads have almost all been widened by half, and new trunk roads have been opened, including the North District trunk road along the Jialing River from Shangqingsi to the city center's Liberation Monument, and the Xiyang Avenue from Lianglukou to Yangjiaping. The only twenty-four broken ox carts that existed at the time of liberation have been completely replaced by 227 new types of buses, in addition to trolleybuses and other various vehicles speeding along. The Chaotianmen Wharf, once chaotic and with steep steps, has been transformed into a flat riverside road. Cable cars have been built at the Caiyuanba Railway Station and Chaotianmen Wharf, facilitating the difficult transportation of goods carried by the broad masses of working people and further connecting the upper and lower cities. The steamboat ferries crossing the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers have not only greatly increased the number of ships and docks, but also implemented a system of not charging fares at important ferry crossings throughout the night. The first Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge will soon be fully completed.

    In order to meet the needs of the working people for rest and recreation, various labor people's cultural palaces, Western Suburbs Park, Pipa Mountain Park, and Eling Park, each with its own unique charm, have been newly built in the past decade. A new road has also been opened along the Jialing River to Beibei Hot Springs, shortening the travel time for tourists. During festivals, people rush to visit the Eighth Route Army Office and the memorial hall of the revolutionary struggle in Zengjiayan and Hongyan Village.

    The Mitingzi and Jiaochangkou, where local bullies, secret societies, and special agents gathered before liberation, engaging in speculation and profiteering, robbery and murder, have become the most prosperous places in the central urban area, and are being built into department stores and people's parks to meet the people's higher material and cultural needs...

    "What a Chongqing city, the mountains are high and the roads are uneven, rats run all over the streets, and bedbugs bite people to death," the ballad used to symbolize and curse the reactionary rulers no longer exists in even a trace. Today, the mountain city is beautiful and full of new vitality. No matter when or where you return to the mountain city, as soon as you step onto the wharf, get off the cable car, or enter Yangjiaping or Shangqingsi from Baishiyi Airport... a boiling atmosphere of socialist leap forward will immediately excite you. You will feel that even the air is dancing, and you will feel that the people of Chongqing are working, chasing after imperialism, with an emotion that is even more enthusiastic than their summer climate and a will that is even more resolute than the red rock of the mountain city... Often, in places unseen for ten days or half a month, factories have sprung up, and chimneys have pierced the clouds like bamboo shoots after rain. In these factories built by the people themselves, large quantities of steel, machinery, fabrics, accordions are being produced... all these products protect happiness and create happiness... This is the style of Chongqing. (Attached photo)

    重庆的风格
    曾克
    城市也像人一样，由于她所生活的自然条件和发展的不同经历，是各具独特风格的。谁接触过她，就会产生印象。谁和她在一起生活得越久，并和她共过患难和同享过幸福，就会对她的风格体会得更深刻，而不仅为她的外观、风貌所感染，还会为她内在的美所吸引。
    重庆，这座为长江和嘉陵江两条巨壮的臂膀所环抱的山城，不就是以她山城所特有的美丽和独具的风格，吸引着她的新交和故友，并给他们留下难忘的记忆吗？
    十年以来，多少在抗战前后和她一起生活过的，一同受难又一同战斗过的人，都找到各种机会，再次的来看望她。有些由于工作繁忙，一时未能来，不论在哪里，凡遇到重庆去的人，都关心地探询着山城变化各方面的情况，如同惦念着自己久别的故乡。多少外国的朋友们，怀着好奇心，来探索山城飞跃发展的秘密和搜摄蒋匪帮最后溃灭的遗迹。当人们从飞机上，轮船里或车窗里，一看到被绿荫复盖着形如半岛的山城；江北和南岸工厂烟囱如林；环绕着山城的青翠如织锦的梯田，他们都禁不住的惊叹赞美说：“多么诗意的城市，多么丰茂的田野，简直是天然的大花园！”
    多少诗人歌颂了山城迷人的夜景，多少画家为终年笼罩着山城的浓、淡雾色，发挥了绝技；多少音乐家从江涛的怒吼和船伕们的号子声中，摄取着活的音符……这一些，都是山城诱人的地方。但，形成她独特风格的更主要因素，却由于重庆是一座人民用加倍的艰巨劳动，开辟建造起来的历史悠久的城市；人民经受过最残酷的奴役，最长的统治而又进行过顽强英勇斗争、留下了胜利光荣的城市，并正以充沛的生命力，从事社会主义建设，使她变成更加美丽的城市。
    我忽然想起1956年9月在保加利亚访问时的一桩小事。一天，我到了曾经作为保加利亚首都的德尔诺沃。这也是一座山城。我到这个城市的历史博物馆去参观。走进第一展览室，就碰见鬓发全白的老馆长，在向观众介绍德尔诺沃的特点。他首先说，山城在世界上是寥寥可数的。他列举了一些著名的山城，赞扬建造山城的人民特别的坚毅和勇敢。这时，陪同我们的保加利亚同志插上嘴说：“老馆长，真太巧了，让我给你介绍这位来自中国山城重庆的朋友！”老馆长一听，马上伸出热情的手，并且连声说了一些像对这个城市有所知又有所问的话。陪同者用在中国留学四年学会的一口流利的北京话，向我翻译后又对老馆长说：“是的，就是国民党蒋介石最后统治的地方，抗日战争时期周恩来和中国共产党地下组织领导人民长期作斗争的地方，毛泽东从延安去作和平谈判的地方。”老馆长朗声笑着表示：这些他全都熟悉。他马上用尊敬的口气，把重庆加入了他的山城介绍的解说词中去，并再三的说：“好，又多了一个山城，而且是斗争的山城！”。
    从上面这段小小的经历中已使我们知道，重庆人民的斗争和建设，不但为国内人民所关怀，而且已经为多瑙河畔的友人所关怀！那么，让我们看看她的过去和现在吧：
    我们完全可以想像，当秦国时，重庆人民劈山断岩，初工依山建筑“江洲”（重庆最早的名称）城市的雄伟气概。解放前，她和祖国别的城市的命运没有什么区别，留下着半封建、半殖民地丑恶、屈辱的印痕。从卖国的清政府和帝国主义订立“芝罘条约”和“马关条约”后，她被开为商埠那时起，她的港口就停泊着悬有外国国旗的军舰。特别在抗日战争时期，国民党反动派政府把重庆做为“陪都”，依靠美国特务机关，压榨、迫害、屠杀人民，留下了无数笔血债。而山城的人民，在党的领导下，写下了光辉灿烂的斗争史诗。我们更加清楚的看到解放十年来，山城翻天复地的变化，并和山城人民一齐用劳动来创建新的史页。
    解放十年来，重庆的工业总产值已比1949年时增长了十三倍，人口从解放时的一百二十万发展成为四百五十万。辖区除原重庆市区、江北、南岸、南桐矿区、北碚等七区外，又增加了綦江、长寿、巴县三县，面积约为七千五百二十五平方公里。
    除工业生产而外，重庆的市政建设变化是最显著的了。重庆人民继承着祖先劈山断岩的坚毅劳动，十年中，搬走一架山又一架山，削平一架岗又一架岗，在山基上修筑起无数的厂房，盖成了可容五千人集会的天坛形的礼堂；可容十五万群众集会的大田湾广场；可容四万五千观众的运动场；马路几乎都加宽了一半，并新开了上清寺至市中心解放碑的沿嘉陵江的北区干路，两路口到杨家坪的西杨大道。解放时仅有的二十四辆破牛车似的公共汽车，已经全部被二百二十七辆各种新型公共汽车所代替，另外，还有无轨电车及其他各种汽车在飞驰。秩序紊乱、梯坡陡立的朝天门码头，已经变成平坦的沿江马路。菜园坝火车站及朝天门码头修建了电缆车，便利了广大劳动人民肩挑背驮运输的困难，更沟通了上下城的来往。横渡长江和嘉陵江的汽船轮渡，不但船只和码头数量大大增加，并且在重要渡口实行了通宵不收渡的制度。第一座白沙沱长江大桥，很快就可以全部竣工了。
    为着满足劳动人民的休息和娱乐，十年来新建了各具不同风趣的劳动人民文化宫，西郊公园，枇杷山公园，鹅岭公园，还新开了沿嘉陵江通往北温泉的公路，缩短了游客的时间。节日里，人民争着去曾家岩和红岩村，参观八路军办事处、革命斗争的纪念馆。
    解放前地痞流氓、袍哥、特务聚集，进行投机倒把，抢劫行凶的米亭子，校场口，已经成为市中区最繁华的地方，并正在兴建为满足人民更高物质文化生活的百货大楼，人民乐园……
    “好个重庆城，山高路不平，老鼠满街跑，臭虫咬死人”，这用来象征和诅咒反动统治者的民谣所刻绘的山城凄荒像，连一丝痕迹也不存在了。而今，山城是美丽而充满着新生命的活力的。不论何时何刻，你从什么地方重回到山城，只消你踏上码头，走下缆车，或是从白市驿飞机场进入杨家坪、上清寺……一种沸腾的社会主义跃进气息，立即就把你激动起来，你会觉得连空气都在跳动，你会感到重庆的人民像用比他们夏日气候还要热烈的情感，比山城特有的红岩石还要坚毅的意志，在工作，在追赶帝国主义……常常，十天半月不见的地方，就耸起了厂房，烟囱如雨后春笋般的钻入云空，就在这人民自建的厂房中，生产着大量的钢铁、机械、布匹、手风琴……这一切保卫幸福、创造幸福的产品……这就是重庆的风格。（附图片）
