Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party held its 16th National Convention in Tokyo today. A total of 556 Socialist Party Diet members and representatives from local organizations attended the convention. In his address to the convention, Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki said that the two main tasks facing the four-day convention are to prevent and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," as well as the construction and consolidation of the Socialist Party. Suzuki said that opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is the Socialist Party's biggest struggle this year. All party members must make their utmost efforts both inside and outside the Diet to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to abolish this treaty. He pointed out that if this struggle is victorious, it will pave the way for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and Japan's complete independence, peace, democracy, and a policy of active neutrality. Conversely, if the Nobusuke Kishi government's plot to revise the "Security Treaty" succeeds, Japan's democratic forces will be subjected to a series of suppressions, and the constitution prohibiting Japan from waging war will also be revised.

Suzuki also emphasized the need to further strengthen the struggle to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and to strive for complete independence and active neutrality. He said that the current international situation is conducive to the struggle against the signing of a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and for the implementation of the Socialist Party's advocated policy of peaceful neutrality.

Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma delivered a report on the activities of the Socialist Party at the meeting. He summarized the achievements of the Socialist Party in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" and in striving for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Asanuma concluded by saying that the new "Security Treaty" that Japan and the United States are attempting to conclude will drag Japan into war, and it will pave the way for Japan to send troops abroad, implement nuclear armament, and revive militarism. He emphasized that the Socialist Party must use all its strength to strengthen the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Representatives from many organizations, such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation, also spoke at the conference, congratulating the conference on its success.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) decided today to designate September and October as "Joint Struggle Months to Strengthen the Prevention of Revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty."

This decision was made at a meeting of representatives from prefectural trade union councils. This meeting was held to review past struggles and prepare to launch a more vigorous movement against the "Security Treaty."

Today's meeting decided that local trade unions will actively participate in the national representative meeting of the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," to be held in Tokyo on September 16.

The meeting also decided to make further efforts to establish joint struggle organizations in cities and towns in various prefectures, and demanded that unions participating in Sohyo hold strikes during the "Joint Struggle Months" to oppose the new Japan-U.S. military treaty.

    日本社会党举行全国代表大会
    讨论加强反对日美“安全条约”
    “总评”决定九、十月为加强反对“安全条约”联合斗争月
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天在东京举行第十六次全国代表大会。社会党的国会议员和地方组织代表共五百五十六人出席了大会。社会党主席铃木茂三郎在大会上致词时说，这次为期四天的大会面临的两个主要任务，是阻止和争取废除日美“安全条约”以及社会党的建设和巩固。铃木说，反对日美“安全条约”是社会党今年最大的斗争。所有党员必须在国会内外以最大的努力来阻止修改“安全条约”和废除这个条约。他指出，如果这个斗争获得胜利，它将为恢复日中邦交和日本的完全独立、和平、民主和积极中立政策开辟道路。反之，如果岸信介政府修改“安全条约”的阴谋得逞，日本民主力量将遭到一系列的镇压，禁止日本作战的宪法也将被修改。
    铃木还强调要进一步加强争取恢复日中邦交和争取完全独立和积极中立的斗争。他说，目前的国际形势有利于反对签订新的日美“安全条约”和实行社会党所主张的和平中立政策的斗争。
    社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎在会上作了关于社会党的活动的报告。他总结了社会党在反对修改“安全条约”、争取恢复日中邦交的斗争方面获得的成果。浅沼最后说，日美企图签订的新的“安全条约”将会把日本拖入战争，它将为日本派兵出国、实行核武装和复活军国主义铺平道路。他强调说，社会党必须用一切力量来加强反对修改“安全条约”的斗争。
    日本工会总评议会、全日本农民协会联合会等许多团体的代表也在大会上讲话，祝大会成功。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天决定9月和10月为“加强阻止修改日美安全条约的联合斗争月”。
    这个决定是在各县工会评议会代表会议上作出的。这次会议是为了检查过去的斗争和准备展开更强有力的反对“安全条约”运动而举行的。
    今天的会议决定，各地工会将积极参加阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议将于9月16日在东京举行的全国代表会议。
    会议还决定要进一步努力在各县的市和镇内成立联合斗争组织，并且要求为参加总评议会的工会在“联合斗争月”期间举行罢工来反对新的日美军事条约。
