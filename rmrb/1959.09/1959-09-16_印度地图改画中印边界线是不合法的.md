It is Illegal for Indian Maps to Revise the Sino-Indian Border Line
Zhou Gengsheng

The two-thousand-kilometer-long border between China and India has never been formally demarcated, but there is, after all, a long-standing customary line. Before liberation, old maps printed in China, such as the famous "Shen Bao" map, divided the Sino-Indian border according to this customary line. The map of "Tibet and Neighboring Countries" published by the Survey of India in 1917, published in the "People's Daily" on the 13th of this month, and the "China" map contained in the 1929 Encyclopedia Britannica, both indicated the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border in a way consistent with Chinese published maps, and did not show the so-called McMahon Line, which China has never recognized. This shows that the customary line of the Sino-Indian border marked on Chinese maps is a border line that China and the United Kingdom, and India have already affirmed. However, the boundary line between northeastern India and the Kangzang region of China, marked on the "Political Map of India" published by the Survey of India in 1956 after independence, has been revised according to the so-called McMahon Line; not only that, the boundary line marked on the currently published maps of India actually goes deeper into Chinese territory in many places than the McMahon Line marked on the attached map of the secret exchange of letters between the British and Tibet in 1914. This means that India deliberately altered the boundary line between China and India, attempting to impose its unilateral claims on China. This Indian practice is obviously neither in line with the principles of Sino-Indian friendship and peaceful coexistence, nor does it conform to international practice.

Generally speaking, the determination of boundary lines between countries is based on either traditional customs or agreements. Changes to existing customary lines must be based on mutual consent, through boundary negotiations, and demarcation, which is common international knowledge. India's change of the customary line between China and India on its maps was clearly done without the consent of the Chinese side. India places particular emphasis on the basis of international agreements in its unilateral claims on the Sino-Indian border, namely the Simla Treaty and the secret exchange of letters regarding the so-called McMahon Line. As the Chinese people and government have long declared, China has never signed the so-called Simla Treaty, let alone recognized the so-called McMahon Line; that so-called international agreement is fundamentally invalid for China, and therefore cannot be used as the basis for India to change the customary line of the Sino-Indian border. Even if India inherited certain rights of the British Empire after its independence in 1947, including borders, it cannot treat the rights illegally occupied by British imperialism as legitimate objects of inheritance. The so-called McMahon Line is fundamentally illegal, and the British did not dare to officially mark it on maps for many years after the Simla Conference. British imperialism has consistently failed to establish the legality of the McMahon Line. Henry Twynam, a Briton who served as the governor of Assam in northeastern India twenty years ago, pointed out in a letter to "The Times" on September 2 that the so-called McMahon Line on the Sino-Indian border "does not exist and has never existed." Then, what legal basis does the Indian government now have to treat the illegal legacy of British imperialism's aggression against Tibet—the McMahon Line—as an object of its inheritance? In short, India's currently published maps' modification of the customary line of the Sino-Indian border has neither been negotiated with the Chinese side nor has any other legal basis, and is therefore unilateral and illegal. On the issue of the demarcation of the Sino-Indian border, two ironclad facts should be acknowledged: first, the Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated; second, there are indeed complex problems left over from British imperialism's policy of aggression. Therefore, the proper way to deal with this issue should be to mutually maintain the long-existing status quo, pending a fair and reasonable solution through friendly consultation. But for India to unilaterally and drastically alter the customary line that has long been consistently affirmed by both sides' maps, attempting to impose India's unilateral claims on demarcation on its neighbor, this practice not only violates international etiquette and international practice, but also violates the principle of international law of respecting territorial sovereignty, which is a major part of the "Panchsheel" jointly advocated by China and India.

    印度地图改画中印边界线是不合法的
    周鲠生
    中国和印度之间两千公里长的边界是从未经过正式划定的，但是毕竟有一条长期存在的习惯线。解放以前，中国印行的旧地图，其中如有名的“申报”地图，都是按照这一习惯线划分中印边界的。本月13日“人民日报”刊出的1917年印度测量局出版的“西藏及邻国”图，以及1929年大英百科全书所载“中国”全图所标示的中印东段边界线的划法，也都同中国出版的地图一致，而没有出现中国所从不承认的所谓麦克马洪线。足见中国地图上标出中印边界那条习惯线，是中国和英、印都早已肯定了的边界线。可是独立后的印度测量局1956年出版的“印度政治地图”所标出印度东北部和中国康藏地区之间的边界线，则根据所谓麦克马洪线改划了；不仅这样，印度现行出版的地图上标明的界线实际上在许多地方比1914年英藏秘密换文的附图所标明的麦克马洪线更加深入中国境内。这意味着印度故意改动中印两国的边界线，企图把它片面的主张强加于中国。印度的这种做法，显然既不符合中印友好、和平共处的原则，而且也是违反国际惯例的。
    一般地说，各国间的边界线的确定不外是根据传统的习惯或协定。既存的习惯线的改动，必须基于双方的同意，通过划界谈判，并且进行勘界，这是国际常识。印度在它的地图上改变中、印间的习惯线，显然是没有得到中国方面的同意的。印度在对中印边界的片面主张上特别强调国际协定的根据，即西姆拉条约和所谓麦克马洪线的秘密换文。如我国人民和政府早已声明的，中国根本就没有签署所谓西姆拉条约，更没有承认所谓麦克马洪线；那个所谓国际协定对中国是根本无效的，因而决不能作为印度改动中印边界的习惯线的根据。纵令印度在1947年独立后，继承了英帝国的某些权利，包括边界，它也不能把英帝国主义非法侵占的权利作为合法继承的目的物。所谓麦克马洪线根本是非法的，并且是英国于西姆拉会议后多年也不敢正式在地图上标出来的。英帝国主义始终就未能确立麦克马洪线的合法性。二十年前做过印度东北部阿萨姆邦长官的英国人亨利·特怀南9月2日在写给“泰晤士报”的一封信里就指出，所谓中印边境的麦克马洪线“并不存在而且从来就没有存在过”。那末，现在印度政府又有什么法律上的依据，可以把英帝国主义对西藏侵略的非法的遗产——麦克马洪线，作为它的继承的目的物呢？总之，印度现行出版的地图对于中印边界习惯线的修改，既没有经过同中国方面的协议，也没有任何其他合法的根据，因而是片面的、非法的。在中印边境划界的问题上，应该承认两个铁定的事实：一、中印边界从未经过正式划定；二、的确存在着英帝国主义侵略政策所遗留下来的复杂问题。因此处理这一问题的正当的办法应该是相互维持久已存在的状况，以待通过友好协商寻求公平而合理的解决。而像印度那样片面地把久已存在的双方地图都一致肯定的习惯线大肆改动，企图把印度对划界的片面主张强加于邻国，这种作法不仅不符合国际礼貌和国际惯例，而且更违反国际法尊重领土主权的原则，而这一原则又是中印两国共同倡导的“潘查希拉”的一个主要部分。
