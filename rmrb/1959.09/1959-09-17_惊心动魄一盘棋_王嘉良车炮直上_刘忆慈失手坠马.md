    A Thrilling Game of Chess
    Wang Jialiang's Chariot and Cannon Charge Straight Ahead, Liu Yici Loses His Horse
    By our reporter You Qi

    The nationally renowned chess masters Wang Jialiang and Liu Yici played against each other for the first time on the morning of the 16th at the National Games' chess competition venue, resulting in a major battle, thrilling and spectacular.

    Liu Yici moved first, opening with the "Immortal Points the Way" pawn advance, a seemingly very stable opening without much aggression. However, because Liu Yici has special expertise in this opening, many chess players have been defeated by him. Wang Jialiang had painstakingly researched ways to break this opening, and countered with the cannon two to the three position. Afterward, both sides adjusted their formations according to their respective strategies, preparing for a major battle. Just as the formations were complete and Liu Yici was about to launch an attack, Wang Jialiang suddenly launched a surprise attack, extending a chariot from the center, inviting Liu Yici to exchange his elephant defense chariot on the river bank. Liu Yici considered for a long time, believing that actively exchanging chariots would be disadvantageous to him, so he made another move. As a result, Wang Jialiang pushed his cannon to attack the chariot, further inviting an exchange. Forced to this point, Liu Yici had only two good moves: one was to exchange chariots, and the other was to exchange a chariot for a horse and cannon. Liu Yici looked back and forth at this point, considering for more than ten minutes, and finally exchanged a chariot for Wang Jialiang's horse and cannon. With this exchange, Liu Yici lost a chariot, and Wang Jialiang's chariot occupied the river bank, seizing a strategic point. However, Liu Yici had his own plans when making this move. He immediately jumped his horse, entering Wang's elephant field. This move was truly ingenious, with three good options for advancement and retreat: one was to advance the chariot to eat the advisor and check the king, winning back an advisor, which would be equivalent to exchanging a chariot for Wang Jialiang's advisor, horse, and cannon, which would be quite worthwhile; if Wang Jialiang did not allow him to eat the advisor, Liu Yici could immediately move the horse back to capture both chariots, which would be an even greater victory. At this point, Wang Jialiang was quite surprised and pondered deeply. Five minutes later, Liu Yici silently shook his head, as if he already felt the unfavorable situation. After another five minutes, Wang Jialiang unexpectedly ignored the threat and extended his chariot straight into Liu Yici's inner palace, counter-capturing Liu Yici's cannon. At this point, Liu Yici looked here and there, and felt that the situation had completely changed. Not only could he not gain anything from the opponent, but he was also in danger of losing pieces and position.

    What should be the next move? Liu Yici found it difficult to come up with a clever move for a while. The timer was ticking relentlessly. Liu Yici thought again and again, and looked at the clock again and again. Twenty minutes passed, and although the next plan had been determined, it was not very good. At this time, Wang Jialiang quietly raised his eyelids, peeking at Liu Yici's expression, and the more he looked, the greater his confidence in victory.

    The final result of this game was: Liu Yici was forced to exchange horses and chariots, leaving a horse, a cannon, and a pawn that had not yet crossed the river. Wang Jialiang possessed a chariot and two pawns that had crossed the river. The pawns that had crossed the river were like entering a no-man's land, charging wildly and killing Liu Yici's retreating cannon. Seeing that there was no hope, Liu Yici admitted defeat.

    After the chess game, Wang Jialiang and Liu Yici replayed the game according to the record. When they reached the point where Wang Jialiang extended the chariot to invite an exchange, Wang Jialiang said: "If I invite an exchange, you should exchange my chariot. This is not a loss for you. Your pieces are very active. After the exchange of chariots, the situation would be stable, and a draw would have been reached." Liu Yici said: "That's right. If I had moved that way, it would definitely have been a draw. But I misjudged a move. I thought I could take a slight loss here, but then jump the horse into the palace to block the elephant's eye, and I could gain more. Who knew it was a fake game, truly a fake game!"

    A mistake is inevitable. Fortunately, this is the first round, and there will be another chance to play again soon. At that time, who will win and who will lose is impossible to predict.

### 惊心动魄一盘棋  王嘉良车炮直上  刘忆慈失手坠马

    惊心动魄一盘棋
    王嘉良车炮直上  刘忆慈失手坠马
    本报记者　尤淇
    全国著名象棋名手王嘉良和刘忆慈，16日上午在全国运动会的象棋竞赛场里第一次交手，发生了一场大战，惊心动魄，蔚为奇观。
    刘忆慈先走，用“仙人指路”挺七卒开局，这种开局法看来十分平稳，没有多大火气，但是因为刘忆慈对这一开局法有特别的造诣，很多棋手都曾败在他的手下。王嘉良为此曾苦心钻研过破解这种局法的门路，就以炮二平三还击。以后双方都根据各自的战略互相调子布阵，准备大战。等到布阵完毕，当刘忆慈正准备趋步进袭的时候，王嘉良忽然奇兵突起，从中路伸出一车，邀刘忆慈的象位河头车相兑。刘忆慈考虑了好久，认为主动兑车于自己不利，就走了别的一着，结果王嘉良划炮打车，进一步邀兑。刘忆慈被迫到这时，只有两步好走，一是兑车，一是以一车换马、炮。刘忆慈这时看来看去，考虑了十多分钟，结果还是以一车换了王嘉良的马、炮。这一换，刘忆慈少了一车，又被王嘉良的车占了河头，扼住要津。但走这一着时的刘忆慈，自有他自己打算，他马上纵马一跳，跃入王方象田。这一着棋，真是十分妙绝，进退共有三步好棋；一是可以进车吃士叫将军，赢回一士，这就等于以一车换了王嘉良的士、马、炮，是相当合算的；王嘉良如果不让吃士，刘忆慈马上可以回马捉双车，这个胜利就更大。这时的王嘉良相当地吃了一惊，苦苦思索。五分钟以后，忽然刘忆慈默默地摇了一摇头，好像已经感到局势的不妙。又过了五分钟，王嘉良竟然置之不理，伸车直入刘忆慈的九宫内廷，反捉刘忆慈的一炮。到此刘忆慈这边看看，那边看看，已感觉到局势完全变化了，非但自己捞不到对方什么东西，自己还有失子失势的危害。
    下一着应该怎么走呢？刘忆慈一时很难想出巧妙的着法。计时钟在无情地嘀?着，刘忆慈再三思索，再三看钟，二十分钟过去了，下一步的方案虽已确定，但不是很好。王嘉良这时悄悄地抬起眼睑，窥视着刘忆慈的表情，越看，他的胜利信心越大。
    这局棋的最后结果是：刘忆慈被迫兑马兑车，剩下了一马一炮和尚未过河的一卒。而王嘉良拥有一车和过河的两兵。过河的兵如入无人之境，横冲直撞，还把刘忆慈的退底炮捉死了。刘忆慈眼看已毫无希望，承认输棋。
    棋赛结束后，王嘉良又和刘忆慈把刚才的那局棋按记录重走了一次，走到王嘉良伸车邀兑的时候，王嘉良说：“我邀兑，你就兑我的车，这于你并不吃亏，你的各路棋子都很活；兑车后，双方平稳，和局已成。”刘忆慈说：“不错，要是那样走，准是和局，但我看错了一着，我认为这边吃点亏，那边跃马进宫塞相眼，我可以多捞一点，谁知是个假局，真是个假局！”
    一着之失，在所难免；好在这是第一回合，不久还有再次交手的机会，那时谁胜谁负，根本无法预测。
