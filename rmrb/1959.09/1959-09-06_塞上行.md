    Journey to the Frontier
    Li Ying
      Mountain Caves
    Amidst the chaotic mountains, shrouded in clouds and mist,
    Our Great Wall meanders between the overlapping ridges,
    Facing the morning sun, it seems ready to take flight with the sun in its mouth,
    In the evening snow, its tail curls in the great wind.
    For two thousand years, wind, frost, rain, and snow
    Have eroded the history and the layered peaks;
    What remains after two thousand years,
    Is only our Great Wall.
    Today, the train carries me north of the border,
    The Great Wall atop the mountains has long faded;
    A whistle blows, the train lights ignite,
    In an instant, we pass through sixty-five mountain caves.
    Sixty-five nights, sixty-five dawns,
    Our long dragon swims freely;
    See inside and outside the Great Wall, north and south of the great river,
    Songs and laughter, flags of red.
    People say the Great Wall embodies the spirit of our nation,
    That is but half a city of blood in the setting sun;
    See our nation's wisdom and pride,
    The train whistles, heading to the frontier.
    Passing through Dajingmen from the north to the Central Plains,
    How many important towns, how many vital thoroughfares,
    In the twilight I walk through Dajingmen,*
    Questioning and searching.
    Where is the sound of camel bells,
    Where are the crowds of merchants,
    Thinking of the treks across the thousand-mile sand sea in the past,
    Where are the vast footprints.
    Only when arriving at this gate,
    Did the camel herds lie down to chew the sand of a thousand miles;
    Erecting tents, lighting bonfires,
    Medicinal herbs, furs exchanged for bricks of tea, lengths of cloth.
    Today I pass through Dajingmen,
    History has long become ancient relics:
    Large factories are built on sand dunes,
    Cars roar, trains spew steam.
    Road signs are nailed to the ancient city walls,
    Mule and horse roads with cracking whips,
    South, north, east, west,
    --Every road leads to socialism.
    Dajingmen, I really want to write a poem for you,
    The crowing of chickens, the flowing water are my words;
    See today the east wind is strong,
    Blowing the entire city into new green overnight.
      *Dajingmen is a famous ancient site in Zhangjiakou, a vital place for trade and commerce in ancient times.
      Plateau Night Song
    Late at night, what is shaking the border region?
    Jingle, jingle,
    A camel team comes from afar,
    Surveying team members embrace a bosom full of wind and sand,
    Frost and snow on the left shoulder, sunshine on the right.
    Passing through Tucheng, passing through villages, welcoming me;
    Thank you for the good hospitality of the inn,
    Tonight the plateau moonlight is beautiful,
    A wind lamp bathes the sand sea,
    Not resting, coming back after the highway is built.
    Markers, measuring tapes measure the earth, and also measure the times,
    Also measure love, where are the construction vanguards going tonight?
    A footprint, a seed,
    A heart, a match!
      Journey to the Frontier
              1
    I just returned from the East Sea,
    My anchor is again dropped on the Loess Plateau.
    The flowers on the plateau invite me,
    Inviting a soldier.
    Drills, waterwheels,
    High-voltage power lines,
    Presenting me with so many bouquets:
    Ears of thatch grass,
    Streaks of canal water,
    Wisps of thick smoke…
    So I returned to the north that gave birth to me,
    My anchor is again dropped on the Loess Plateau.
              2
    My boundless yellow sea,
    Who knows how deep you are,
    You have no seawater,
    But the waves of sheep are boundless;
    Who knows where your source is,
    You have no shores,
    But I can moor my boat in every port of yours.
              3
    Brothers,
    Let's not tell the old stories anymore:
    A loved one washing a bloodstained coat under the moonlight,
    Who knows where the soldier is;
    Let's bury them under layers of sand dunes,
    It's too tragic,
    It's too bitter.
    Today there are no more wolf howls,
    No more skinny horses,
    No more beacon fires…
              4
    I don't want to go to the depths of the sand sea to see mirages,
    Nor do I want to drink your mellow milk anymore,
    I just want to take a walk with the wind,
    Scoop up a handful of water to wash my sails.
    Solemn and simple earth,
    How much like a soldier,
    Your character, your emotions;
    I drank your water carrying settled sand,
    I became even more heroic, even more brave,
    Ah! Motherland! Oh, Motherland,
    How strong you are, how beautiful you are,
    Let me embrace you,
    Bathing in the morning light…

    塞上行
    李瑛
      山洞
    乱山丛中，云雾迷蒙，
    重岭间蜿蜒着我们的长城，
    迎朝阳，它仿佛要衔日飞去，
    暮雪里尾卷大风。
    两千年了，风霜雨雪，
    剥蚀了史册和叠嶂重岭；
    两千年依然留存的，
    唯有我们的万里长城。
    今日列车载我走塞北，
    山顶长城早黯淡了面容；
    一声汽笛，车灯燃亮，
    转眼穿过了六十五座山洞。
    六十五个黑夜，六十五个黎明，
    我们的长龙在恣意游泳；
    看长城内外，大江南北，
    歌声笑语旌旗红。
    人说长城体现了我们民族的精神，
    那只不过是夕阳半城血半城；
    看我们民族的智慧和骄傲，
    火车一叫塞上行。
    过大境门从塞北到中原，
    有多少重镇，多少要衢，
    暮色里我走过大境门，*
    一边叩问，一边寻觅。
    哪里是驼队的铃声，
    哪里是云集的商旅，
    想昔日千里沙海的跋涉，
    哪里是茫茫足迹。
    只待有一天到达这门前，
    驼群才伏下咀嚼千里砂碛；
    架帐篷，点篝火，
    药材、毛皮换回几块砖茶，几尺布匹。
    今日我过大境门，
    历史早成了陈年古迹：
    沙窝子上建起大工厂，
    汽车轰响，火车喷汽。
    路标钉在古城头，
    骡马大道鞭花急，
    向南、向北、向东、向西，
    ——条条路都通向社会主义。
    大境门，我真想为你写一首诗，
    鸡鸣、流水都是我的文字；
    看今日东风正紧，
    一夜吹得你满城新绿。
      *大境门为张家口著名古迹，古时此地为通商贸易要地。
      高原夜歌
    夜深了，是什么在摇动边塞？
    叮当当，叮当当，
    骆驼大队远方来，
    勘测队员抱一怀风沙，
    左肩霜雪，右肩日晒。
    过土城，过村寨，欢迎我；
    感谢旅店好接待，
    今夜高原月色好，
    一盏风灯浴沙海，
    不歇啦，公路修成再回来。
    标杆、皮尺测大地，也量时代，
    也量爱，今夜建设尖兵去哪边？
    一只脚印，一粒种子，
    一颗心，一根火柴！
      塞上行
              1
    我刚从东海回来，
    我的锚又抛在黄土高原。
    高原上的花邀请我，
    邀请一个战士。
    钻机、水车，
    高压电线，
    献给我这么多花束：
    穗穗茅草，
    条条渠水，
    缕缕浓烟……
    于是我回到了生我的北方，
    我的锚又抛在黄土高原。
              2
    我的无际的黄色的海哟，
    谁知道你有多深，
    你没有海水，
    但羊群的浪涛无边；
    谁知道你的源头在哪里，
    你没有岸，
    但我在你的每个港口都可泊船。
              3
    弟兄们，
    不要再讲古老的故事了：
    月下亲人洗血衣，
    谁知征人在哪边；
    要层层沙丘埋掉它们吧，
    它太悲惨，
    它太辛酸。
    今天再没有狼嚎，
    再没有瘦马，
    再没有烽烟……
              4
    我不想再去沙海深处看幻景，
    也不想再喝你香醇的奶，
    我只想和风一起去散步，
    掬一捧水，濯我的帆。
    庄严朴素的大地呵，
    多么像一个战士，
    你的性格、你的情感；
    我喝了你带着沉沙的水，
    我便越发豪迈、越发勇敢，
    呵！祖国！祖国呵，
    你多强大，你多美好，
    让我拥抱你吧，
    浴着晨光……
