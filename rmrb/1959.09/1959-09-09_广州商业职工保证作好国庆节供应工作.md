Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 7th: Guangzhou's tens of thousands of commercial workers have recently held oath-taking rallies and skills competitions, written big-character posters, submitted letters of determination, and launched competitions to resolutely do a good job in commodity procurement and supply, in response to the great call issued by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

Workers responsible for purchasing at the Guangzhou Transportation Electrical Equipment Purchasing and Supply Station, through careful accounting, tapping potential, and finding sources of goods in factories, found more than 3 million yuan worth of goods in two days. For example, they exchanged steel with the Guangzhou Hardware Station to support factory production, enabling the assembly of more than 100 electric blowers; they also exchanged round steel for more than 40 tons of iron sheets and other raw materials, enabling factories to produce 300 fans, transformers, table lamps, and so on. The eighteen specialized purchasing and supply stations under the First Commercial Bureau recently strengthened their procurement work, sending more than seventy people to other provinces for purchasing. Workers in the city went to factories to help tap production potential, increase production, assist in packaging finished products and transporting products out of the factory, so that commodities could be put on the market in a timely manner. After discussing the communique and resolutions, more than 1,200 employees of the Guangzhou State-owned Storage and Transportation Company launched a competition to do a good job in commodity storage and transportation, and to complete the National Day material transportation tasks ahead of schedule. In recent days, the company's transporters, team porters, auto repair shop, and office workers have taken emergency action and joined the rush transportation battle.

Commercial workers throughout the city actively improve business management, improve service attitudes, and facilitate the masses. More than 900 employees of the Xidi Department Store, the largest in Guangzhou, are more enthusiastically carrying out the socialist labor competition of "Six-Good Sales Department, Seven-Good Salesperson." They are determined to make this year's sales reach more than 35.5 million yuan, an increase of 9.37 million yuan over last year. In order to achieve this plan, each sales department and even each salesperson has formulated specific plans and guarantees.

    广州商业职工保证作好国庆节供应工作
    据新华社广州7日电　广州市几万名商业职工，近来纷纷举行誓师会、比武会，写大字报、递决心书，开展竞赛，决心做好商品采购供应工作，来响应党的八届八中全会发出的伟大号召。
    广州市交通电工器材采购供应站负责进货的职工，通过算细账、挖潜力和下厂找货源，在两天内就找到了三百多万元的货源。如与广州五金站调换钢材，支援工厂生产，使一百多台电动鼓风机能够配成套；又以圆钢对换铁皮四十多吨及其他原料，能组织工厂生产三百台风扇和变压器、台灯等。第一商业局所属十八个专业采购供应站，最近加强了采购工作，增派七十多人到省外采购，在本市的职工纷纷到工厂去帮助挖掘生产潜力，增加生产，协助包装成品和运输产品出厂，使商品能够及时上市。广州市国营储运公司一千二百多名职工讨论了公报和决议后，掀起了搞好商品保管、运输，提前完成国庆节物资调运任务的竞赛高潮。这些天来，公司的运输员、车队搬运工人、汽车修理厂和科室的职工，都紧急行动起来，投入了抢运战斗。
    全市商业职工积极改进经营管理，改善服务态度，方便群众。广州市最大的西堤百货商店九百多名职工，更加火热地开展了“六好售货部、七好售货员”的社会主义劳动竞赛，他们决心使今年的销售额达到三千五百五十多万元，比去年增加九百三十七万元。为了实现这一计划，每个售货部以至每一个售货员都订出了具体的计划和保证。
