(Our newspaper, Changchun, 6th dispatch) Jilin's Jiaohe County, having already surpassed the agricultural program targets for average grain unit yield last year, is determined to "cross the Yellow River" nine years ahead of schedule. This year, they aim to reach a grain yield of 541 jin per mu, a 34% increase compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

This year, due to the widespread deep plowing of land and the excavation of large amounts of peat, the county's land fertilization has doubled compared to last year. The promotion of rational close planting and the intercropping of 80% of soybeans with corn have resulted in better crop growth than during the Great Leap Forward of 1958 in all communes.

The more than 500 hectares of wheat planted this year have generally yielded a bumper harvest. Seven communes, including Tiangang, Xinnong, and Songjiang, have achieved an average yield of 2,400 jin per hectare, a 50% increase compared to the highest historical average wheat yield. A small number of experimental fields have even created a high-yield record of 7,500 jin per hectare. The autumn crops are growing even better. According to a recent typical survey conducted by the agricultural department in five people's communes, namely Wulin, Lafa, Xinzhan, Chishui, and Huangsongdian, this year's crops have the following four characteristics: First, a higher number of plants. Compared to last year, the number of corn seedlings per hectare has increased from around 25,000 to 28,000 to 30,000 to 35,000. The number of rice seedlings per hectare has increased from 3.5 million to 3.7 million to over 4.5 million. The number of soybean seedlings per hectare has increased from 250,000 to 270,000 to 300,000 to 350,000. Second, taller crop height. Last year, corn was generally 4 to 5 chi tall, while this year it is generally 5.5 to over 6 chi tall. Last year, rice was generally 1.5 to 2.1 chi tall, while this year it is generally 2.2 to 2.7 chi tall. Last year, soybeans were generally 1.7 to 2 chi tall, while this year they are generally 2.3 to 2.8 chi tall. Third, larger ears/pods. Last year, corn cobs were generally 4 to 5 cun long, while this year they are generally 6 to 7 cun long. Last year, rice panicles were generally 3 to 3.5 cun long, while this year they are 3.5 to 4 cun long. Fourth, more grains. Last year, each rice panicle had about 90 to 100 grains, while this year they all have 100 to 110 grains. Last year, each soybean plant had about 80 to 100 grains, while this year they all have 110 to 140 grains. Other crops also have the above four characteristics.

Due to the tremendous superiority demonstrated by the people's communes and the promising agricultural production prospects, the masses' enthusiasm for labor is exceptionally high. Furthermore, overcoming right-leaning slackening sentiments on the ideological front recently has made the surpassing production quota movement even more vigorous.

The Jiaohe County Party Committee, based on the crop growth this year and after fully assessing the favorable conditions and possibilities for achieving a greater leap forward in the second half of the year, decided to increase production by 30% on the basis of the implemented production quota targets, bringing the total grain output to 147,000 tons, a 14% increase compared to last year's actual output. The unit area yield will increase by 34% compared to last year, with a grain yield of 541 jin per mu, "crossing the Yellow River" nine years ahead of schedule.

The County Party Committee's call immediately received a warm response from the vast number of cadres and the masses. Since the beginning of August, leading cadres at all levels have gathered in the fields, conducting large-scale field inspections and comparisons to implement surpassing production quota targets down to individual plots and assign measures to individuals, effectively promoting the surpassing production quota movement. By August 26, more than 40,000 people were involved in field management, accounting for 67.3% of the total labor force. Rice has been weeded three times, and more than 10,000 hectares have been top-dressed with fertilizer. Large areas of corn have had autumn ridges added, and soybeans have had tall weeds removed.

### 蛟河农民今年要“跨过黄河”  力争粮食亩产量比去年增长三成以上

    蛟河农民今年要“跨过黄河”
    力争粮食亩产量比去年增长三成以上
    本报长春6日电　吉林蛟河县在去年粮食作物平均单位产量超过农业纲要指标的基础上，决心提前九年“跨过黄河”，今年达到亩产粮食五百四十一斤，比大跃进的1958年增长34％。
    今年，由于全县土地普遍进行了深翻，挖掘了大量草炭，使全县的土地施肥量比去年增加一倍，推广了合理密植，有80％的大豆同苞米实行了间种，各公社的庄稼都比大跃进的1958年生长得好。
    今年全县种的五百多公顷小麦普遍丰收。天岗、新农、松江等七个公社，平均每公顷产量达到二千四百斤，比历史上小麦最高平均产量增长50％。少数试验田还创造了每公顷七千五百斤的高产纪录。大秋作物更是生长得好。据农业部门最近在乌林、拉法、新站、池水、黄松甸等五个人民公社的典型调查，今年庄稼有以下四个特点：第一、株数多。今年同去年比较，每公顷苞米保苗由二万五千到二万八千株左右，增加到三万株到三万五千株。每公顷水稻保苗由三百五十万株到三百七十万株，增加到四百五十万株以上。每公顷大豆保苗由二十五万株到二十七万株，增加到三十万株到三十五万株，第二，作物身量高。去年苞米一般是四尺到五尺左右高，今年一般是五尺五寸到六尺多高。去年水稻一般是一尺五寸到二尺一寸高，今年一般是二尺二寸到二尺七寸高。去年大豆一般是一尺七寸高到二尺高，今年一般是二尺三寸到二尺八寸高。第三，穗大。去年苞米棒一般是四寸到五寸长，今年一般是六寸到七寸长。去年水稻穗一般是三寸到三寸五分长，今年是三寸五分到四寸长。第四，粒多。去年每个稻穗九十到一百粒左右，今年都是一百粒到一百一十粒。去年每株大豆八十粒到一百粒左右，今年都是一百一十粒到一百四十粒。其它作物也都具有以上四个特点。
    由于人民公社显示了巨大的优越性，农业生产丰收在望，广大群众劳动热情异常高涨，加上最近以来在思想战线上克服了右倾松劲情绪，使超包产运动更加轰轰烈烈地开展起来。
    中共蛟河县委根据今年庄稼的生长情况，在充分估计了下半年实现更大跃进的有利条件和可能性以后，确定在包产指标落实的基础上增产三成，使粮食总产量达到十四万七千吨，比去年实产量增长14％。单位面积产量比去年增长34％，每亩产粮五百四十一斤，提前九年“跨过黄河”。
    县委的号召立即得到了广大干部和群众的热烈响应。进入8月以来，各级领导干部会师田间，通过田间大检查、大评比，把超包产指标落实到地块，把措施落实到人，有力地推动了超包产运动。到8月26日，全县投入田间管理的有四万多人。占劳动力总数的67.3％。水稻前后薅了三遍，并且有一万多公顷追了肥。大片苞米放了秋垅，大豆拔了大草。（附图片）
