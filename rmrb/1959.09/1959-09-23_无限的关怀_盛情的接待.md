	Infinite Care, Warm Reception
	By our reporter Jiang Wenpin
	"We must make this National Games a success, a spectacular success!" This directive from the Party has ignited the soaring enthusiasm of the athletes and inspired those who support the Games in various ways and directly serve the Games.
	The capital has shown unparalleled enthusiasm and warm reception to the athletes who have come from thousands of miles away. When you take a car and circle around the various competition venues, residences, medical stations, canteens, small shops, and motor pools, you will discover many moving stories.
	Enthusiastic Driver Comrades
	The more than seven hundred driver comrades who came to serve the Games showed unparalleled enthusiasm. Every day, from morning to night, they had to transport more than ten thousand athletes, referees, and Games staff to dozens of practice venues and dozens of competition areas. When the competitions were over, they would take them back to their respective residences late at night. Many drivers would take athletes living far away in places like the Beijing Institute of Physical Education in the northern suburbs back from the city's gymnasiums, and by the time they got home and lay in bed, it was already two o'clock in the morning. These admirable drivers, in order to maximize the potential of the vehicles and ensure that the athletes could get a ride at any time, set up five ring roads with a total length of about 122 kilometers in one night. They are not only good drivers, but also the best service personnel. Many comrades sent rain gear to the athletes on rainy days, which moved the athletes and made them even more energetic, determined to create better results to repay the Party's care.
		Warm Reception
	The people of the capital also showed great enthusiasm for accommodating the sports delegations from all over the country. The Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Academy of Educational Administration, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Railways, the Political and Legal Cadre School, the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Urban Service Bureau all gave their best guesthouses and houses to the Games. The Political and Legal Cadre School gave up a large area of its campus to accommodate thirteen delegations. The Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee personally prepared accommodation for the Games. They used the "Northern Hotel" used to receive foreign guests, the famous scenic spot "Fragrant Hills Hotel" in the capital, and the "Yongwai Hotel," which regularly receives ethnic minorities, to receive the sports delegations. Many guest rooms in the renowned "Asian Student Sanatorium" were also occupied by athletes.
	The Yongwai Hotel, which was responsible for receiving the sports delegations from Tibet, Shaanxi, Qinghai and other ethnic minorities, cleaned more than 5,000 sets of bedding, sheets, pillowcases, and pillow towels before the guests arrived, and scrubbed all corridors and rooms clean with lye water. When the guests arrived, the service staff washed clothes for the athletes. In order to ensure that the athletes were physically strong and comfortable for the competition, Peng Wenhai, an old service staff who had studied traditional Chinese medicine and had family-inherited "bone-setting and massage" techniques, enthusiastically massaged the injured and tired athletes and used many effective bone-setting Chinese medicines inherited from his family for the athletes. Many ethnic minority athletes excitedly shook Peng Wenhai's hand and called him "Doctor Peng" and "Uncle Peng."
	The leading comrades and service staff of the guesthouse of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, which was responsible for receiving the Xinjiang and Jilin sports delegations, cared for the guests as if they were family members. Athletes of all ethnic groups could eat food that suited their ethnic customs here.
	Among the nearly five hundred cooks who were transferred from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places to serve the Games, there were many famous chefs, including chefs who had gone abroad to teach Chinese "Peking Duck" techniques. In order to cook good meals and let the athletes eat well and create new records, they worked day and night by the stove. Some units served seven meals from noon to night without complaint. When the athletes created new records, they happily added meat and vegetables for them and wrote letters and big-character posters to congratulate them. The cooks and athletes encouraged each other in this way and made progress together. If you go to the restaurants of each delegation, you will see big-character posters in red and green praising the cooks everywhere.
	In order to enable the athletes and referees to have more energy for competition and work, the Party and the government provided the Games with a large amount of fresh meat, fresh fish, fresh vegetables, fruits, snacks, and good rice and flour.
	White-Clad Warriors on the Sports Field
	When you walk on the various competition venues, if you pay a little attention, you will also find many white-clad warriors running around the sports field. This Games transferred 171 medical personnel from 23 hospitals in Beijing to serve the Games. Wu Zhihan, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, personally served as the Director of the Medical Office at the Games.
	These medical personnel formed a total of thirty-two first-aid stations, each with a doctor, two nurses, and an ambulance. Some key events, such as women's motorcycle cross-country, had four first-aid stations. In addition, each of the forty-eight residential points of the Games had a doctor responsible for daily medical work. The Games also established entrusted relationships with sixteen hospitals in the capital.

    无限的关怀　盛情的接待
    本报记者　姜文品
    “一定要把这次全运会开得好，开得精彩！”党的这个指示，激起了运动员们的冲天干劲，也鼓舞了在各方面支援大会和直接为大会服务的人们。
    首都各方面对不远千里而来的运动员们都表现了无比的热情和盛情的接待。当你乘坐着汽车，绕着各个竞赛场地、居住点、医疗站、食堂、小卖部和汽车场转一转，就会发现许许多多动人的事迹。
    热情的司机同志们
    前来为大会服务的七百多名汽车司机同志，表现了无比的热情。他们每天从早到晚要把一万多名运动员、裁判员和大会的工作人员，准时送到几十个练习场地、几十个比赛区域。当他们比赛完了的时候，深更半夜再把他们送到各自的住地。许多司机半夜里从市里的体育馆把远住在北郊体育学院等地的运动员们送回去，他们赶回家躺在床上时，已经是夜里两点钟了。这些可敬的司机们，为了更大地发挥车辆的潜力和保证运动员随时坐车的需要，一夜之间就安设好了五条全长约一百二十二公里的环行路。他们不但是好汽车司机，也是最好的服务员。许多同志雨天给运动员去送雨具，感动了运动员们，使他们更加意气风发，一心要创造更好的成绩，报答党的关怀。
        盛情的接待
    首都人民对安置来自祖国各地的体育代表团也表现了极大的热情。中共中央组织部、全国总工会、教育行政学院、建筑工程部、轻工业部、铁道部、政法干校、解放军总部和北京市城市服务局等单位，都把自己最好的招待所、房舍让给了大会。政法干校把大片的校址让出来，住了十三个代表团。北京市人民委员会秘书长亲自为大会筹备住所。他们把接待外宾用的“北方饭店”、首都有名的风景区“香山饭店”和经常负责接待少数民族的“永外旅馆”都用于接待体育代表团。盛名远扬的“亚洲学生疗养院”好多客房也住上了运动员。
    负责接待西藏、陕西、青海等少数民族体育代表团的永外旅馆，客人没到以前，服务员们就亲自动手把五千多件被套、褥单、枕套、枕巾等洗得干干净净，把所有走廊和房间都用刷子蘸着碱水擦刷得一洁二净。客人们来了，服务员们为运动员洗衣服。为使运动员们体格健壮、周身舒适地进行比赛，过去学过中医，并有家传“正骨、按摩”技术的老服务员彭文海，热情地为?伤和疲劳的运动员们按摩，并把家里祖传下来的许多有特效正骨的中药给运动员们使用。很多少数民族运动员激动地握着彭文海的手叫他“彭大夫”和“彭大爷”。
    负责接待新疆、吉林体育代表团的中共中央组织部招待所的领导同志和服务员们，对客人的关怀照顾亲如家人。各民族的运动员在这里都能吃到合于自己民族习惯的饭菜。
    从北京、上海、天津等各地调来为大会服务的近五百名炊事员中，有许多名厨，包括出国传授过中国“烤鸭”技术的厨师。他们为了做好饭，让运动员们吃好，创造新纪录，都夜以继日地在灶旁工作着。有些单位从中午到晚上开过七次饭，也毫无怨言。当运动员们创造了新纪录，他们又高兴地为他们加肉加菜，写信、写大字报表示祝贺。你到各代表团的餐厅一看，到处都贴着红红绿绿表扬炊事员的大字报。炊事员和运动员们就是这样互勉互励，共同跃进。
    党和政府为了使运动员裁判员们有更充沛的精力进行比赛和工作，把大批的鲜肉、鲜鱼、鲜菜、水果、点心和好米、好面应有尽有地供给大会。
    运动场上的白衣战士
    当你走在各个竞赛场地，若是稍微注意一下，还会发现好多白衣战士奔忙在运动场上。这次大会从北京市二十三个医院调出了一百七十一个医务人员为大会服务。北京市卫生局的副局长吴之汉亲自在大会兼任医务处长。
    这些医务人员共组成了三十二个急救点，每个急救点都有一个大夫，两个护士和一辆救护车，有些重点项目如女摩托车越野，就设有四个急救点。此外，大会的四十八个居住点，每处都有医生负责日常的医疗工作。大会还与首都十六家医院建立了委托关系。
