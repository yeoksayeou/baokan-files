Xinhua News Agency, September 15th, dispatch from TASS Moscow, September 15th: The Soviet government issued a statement on the Laotian situation on September 14th, suggesting a prompt meeting of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to resolve the Laotian issue and normalize the situation in the region.

The statement first addressed the fact that on September 7, representatives of Western countries in the Security Council took illegal actions, attempting to use the guise of the United Nations to conceal their interference in Laotian affairs. The statement said that the Soviet government cannot ignore the action of ten members of the Security Council, disregarding the UN Charter and violating the Geneva Agreements on Laos, in voting to establish a subcommittee to investigate the Laotian situation, because this action harbors serious consequences and its purpose is clearly to create obstacles to hinder the smooth implementation of measures currently being taken to ease international tensions.

The statement expressed the belief that the tensions arising in Laos can and should only be resolved on the basis and within the scope of the Geneva Agreements, as the Geneva Agreements are the foundation of peace and security in Indochina. The statement said that the Soviet government considers it its inescapable duty to uphold the Geneva Agreements on Indochina, because abolishing these agreements would mean abolishing the only legal basis for maintaining peace in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

The statement concluded that, in order to resolve the Laotian issue and normalize the situation in the region, the Soviet government believes it is necessary to promptly convene a meeting of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to discuss the situation in Laos. The Soviet government believes that the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos should report to the aforementioned conference on the results of its work and the recommendations it has put forward regarding measures to normalize the situation in Laos. The Soviet government hopes that this proposal by the Soviet government will be supported by the governments of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Laotian Situation (September 15, 1959)

The Soviet government issued a statement on the Laotian situation on September 14, 1959, pointing out that the crux of the current Laotian situation lies in the attempt by certain Western groups to use the Laotian issue to hinder the easing of international tensions, and to completely tear up the Geneva Agreements, which are the only legal basis for resolving the Laotian issue and maintaining peace in Indochina, through the destruction of the UN Charter and the illegal dispatch of the so-called "investigation team". In order to ease international tensions and peacefully resolve the Laotian issue, the Soviet government has proposed the prompt convening of a conference of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to discuss the Laotian situation. The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that this major peace initiative of the Soviet government is reasonable and timely, and the Government of the People's Republic of China, as a participant in the 1954 Geneva Conference, expresses its full support.

The Government of the People's Republic of China has pointed out in three statements on February 18th, May 18th and August 12th this year that the rapid deterioration of the Laotian situation was caused single-handedly by the United States. The US State Department, on February 12, the day after it instigated the Sananikone government to abandon the Geneva Agreements on the Laotian issue on February 11, issued a statement supporting this illegal action by the Sananikone government, and considered that after this the United States could "freely" establish a military mission in Laos. After the Sananikone government ordered the disarming of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units on May 11 and launched armed attacks against the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, provoking a civil war in Laos, the United States further supported and instigated the Laotian authorities to carry out new military conspiracies. Under the direction of the United States, the Laotian authorities colluded with Thailand, a member of the Manila military bloc, and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique, signing a series of secret, military-natured agreements. They attempted to form a trilateral military alliance, making Laos and South Vietnam quasi-members of the Manila Pact. On July 23, Laos also signed an agreement with France, actually "requesting" assistance from so-called "American military experts." On July 29, the Laotian authorities even ordered the arrest of Prince Souphanouvong and other nine leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and launched a movement to persecute former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and members of the Lao Patriotic Front throughout the country. On August 27, the United States announced that it would provide weapons and other military equipment to the Laotian government. The above series of acts that grossly violate the Geneva Agreements have created an extremely serious situation in Laos.

The Government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly pointed out, and fully agrees with what the Soviet government stated in its statement: the tensions arising in the Laotian region can and should be resolved on the basis and within the scope of the Geneva Agreements, as the Geneva Agreements are the foundation of peace and security in Indochina. In order to promote an early resolution of the Laotian issue, the Chinese government has suggested to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, and to the Indian government, the chairman of the International Commission for Laos, that the activities of the International Commission for Laos should be resumed promptly. The Chinese government fully agrees with the Soviet government's proposal to promptly convene a conference of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference and believes that this conference should hear the report and recommendations of the International Commission for Laos. In order to ease the Laotian situation, convening such a conference is imperative! The Chinese government firmly believes that the Geneva Conference, which once restored peace in the Indochina region, will certainly be able to once again play its due role in promoting the normalization of the Laotian situation. The Chinese government hopes that the governments and peoples of all countries concerned about maintaining peace in Southeast Asia and hoping for the easing of international tensions will unanimously support this major peace initiative of the Soviet government and promote its rapid realization.

    苏中两国政府就老挝局势问题分别发表声明
    召集日内瓦会议参加国讨论老挝局势
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联政府在9月14日发表关于老挝局势的声明，建议迅速召集参加1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的国家开会，以解决老挝问题和使这个地区的局势正常化。
    声明首先谈到1959年9月7日，西方国家的代表在安全理事会中采取想用联合国的幌子来掩饰他们对老挝事务的干涉的非法活动。声明说，苏联政府不能无视安理会的十个理事国不顾联合国宪章，并且违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议，投票赞成建立一个调查老挝局势的小组委员会的行动，因为这种行动包藏着严重的后果，其目的显然是想制造障碍，来阻挠目前在缓和国际紧张局势方面所采取的措施的顺利执行。
    声明表示相信，在老挝产生的紧张局势能够而且应当只在日内瓦协议的基础上和范围内求得解决，因为日内瓦协议是印度支那和平和安全的基础。声明说，苏联政府认为，维护关于印度支那的日内瓦协议是自己义不容辞的义务，因为废除这些协议将意味着取消维持越南、老挝和柬埔寨和平的唯一法律基础。
    声明最后说，为了解决老挝问题和使这个地区的局势正常化，苏联政府认为必须迅速召集参加1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的国家开会，来讨论在老挝所形成的局势。苏联政府认为，老挝国际监察和监督委员会应当向上述会议报告它的工作结果和它所提出的关于使老挝局势正常化的措施的建议。苏联政府希望，苏联政府这一建议将会得到日内瓦会议参加国政府的支持。（注：苏联政府声明全文见第五版）
    新华社15日讯　中华人民共和国政府关于老挝局势的声明（1959年9月15日）
    苏联政府1959年9月14日就老挝局势发表了声明，指出当前老挝局势的症结在于西方国家某些集团企图利用老挝问题阻挠国际紧张局势的和缓，并且以破坏联合国宪章、非法派遣所谓“调查小组”的手法，进而彻底撕毁解决老挝问题和维护印度支那和平唯一法律基础的日内瓦协议。为了和缓国际紧张局势和和平解决老挝问题，苏联政府建议迅速召集1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议参加国会议，讨论老挝局势。中华人民共和国政府认为：苏联政府这项重大的和平倡议是合理的和及时的，中华人民共和国政府作为1954年日内瓦会议的参加国表示完全支持。
    中华人民共和国政府曾经在今年2月18日、5月18日和8月12日先后三次声明中指出：老挝局势的迅速恶化是美国一手造成的。美国国务院在2月12日，也就是在它唆使萨纳尼空政府于2月11日废弃关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的第二天，就声明支持萨纳尼空政府这一非法行动，并且认为在这以后美国就可以“自由地”在老挝设立一个军事使团了。在萨纳尼空政府于5月11日下令解除前寮国战斗部队武装并且向前寮国战斗部队发动武装进攻，挑起老挝内战以后，美国又多方支持和策动老挝当局进行新的军事阴谋。在美国导演下，老挝当局同马尼拉军事集团成员国的泰国以及南越吴庭艳集团勾结起来，签订一系列秘密的、带有军事性质的协定。企图结成三边的军事同盟，使老挝和南越成为马尼拉集团准成员国。7月23日，老挝还同法国签订一项协议，竟“要求”所谓“美国军事专家”给予帮助。7月29日，老挝当局竟下令逮捕老挝爱国战线党苏发努冯亲王等九名领导人员，并且在全国范围内发动了一个迫害前寮国战斗部队和老挝爱国战线党员的运动。8月27日，美国宣布，美国将向老挝政府提供武器和其他军事装备。上述一系列粗暴地破坏日内瓦协议的行为造成了极端严重的老挝局势。
    中华人民共和国政府曾经多次指出，并且完全同意苏联政府声明中所说：老挝地区产生的紧张局势能够而且应当在日内瓦协议的基础上和范围内求得解决，因为日内瓦协议是印度支那和平和安全的基础。中国政府为了促使老挝问题的早日解决，曾经向日内瓦会议两主席苏联和英国政府以及向老挝国际委员会主席印度政府建议，迅速恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。中国政府完全同意苏联政府提出的迅速召开1954年日内瓦会议参加国会议的建议，并且认为这个会议应该听取老挝国际委员会的报告和建议。为了和缓老挝局势，召开这种会议，已经刻不容缓了！中国政府深信：曾经恢复了印度支那地区和平的日内瓦会议一定能够再一次起到促使老挝局势正常化的应有作用。中国政府希望：一切关心维护东南亚和平和希望国际紧张局势和缓的国家的政府和人民将会同声支持苏联政府这一重大的和平倡议，并且促其迅速实现。
