    Ferry Crossing
    Wu Jianxin, Lishu People's Commune, Changsha, Hunan
    Early autumn, and the morning sun is still scorching. I followed Old Tian, our production team's Party branch secretary, from the pig farm, and by the time we reached the bank of the Liuyang River, our shirts were soaked with sweat.

    We were about to cross the river here to the opposite bank. The Liuyang River makes a large bend here, and the ferry crossing is conveniently located at this bend, making the already not-so-narrow Liuyang River seem even wider.

    "The ferry just left, so we'll have to wait here again!" I looked in the direction Old Tian was pointing, and sure enough, the small, covered ferry was drifting in the middle of the river....

    On the riverbank slope was a patch of young bamboo forest, interspersed with a tall camphor tree. We headed towards the shade of the tree, and we discovered that a young girl was already sitting in the dense shade, resting. Beside her on the left was a blue cloth umbrella, and on the right was a bamboo basket containing several empty bowls and an oil bottle.

    "Secretary Tian, crossing the river?" The girl knew Old Tian.

    "Yes, are you going to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy tofu?" He said, sitting down in the shade of the tree, and then continued to me, "Sit down and cool off. This 'little sister' is a canteen manager. Almost all thirty-odd public canteens in our team have selected these young people as managers. Many are graduates of higher primary school and have some education, because running a public canteen requires writing accounts and such, and without some education, it's really not possible."

    I looked at the "little sister". Indeed, she had a chubby, round face and looked no more than fifteen or sixteen years old.

    "How often do you eat tofu in your canteen?" I asked her.

    "About once a week."

    "Before the public canteens? Humph, I'm afraid some people couldn't eat it for months!" Old Tian was, after all, a young man. In addition to being warm and hospitable, he also spoke eagerly, afraid that others would finish speaking before he had a chance. He then asked, "Tell me, 'little sister', how is that Chen Mandie doing in your canteen?"

      "How is he? It's only been a few days since he came back, so it's hard to tell. Anyway, the people in the canteen aren't happy about his return. They all say that without him, the public canteen would be quieter and less trouble. Besides, joining is joining, making a fuss about withdrawing, and immediately withdrawing, is a bit too 'free'! But..." Before the girl could finish, Old Tian turned to me and said, "You probably don't know, this happened more than a month ago. This Chen Mandie is an upwardly mobile household, with some fruit trees and several decent houses, and has always lived well. He's only forty years old, but he doesn't like to work hard. Ever since he started eating in the public canteen, he's been complaining about the food not being to his liking, and he argues with the kitchen staff all day long. Actually, he doesn't necessarily dislike the taste of the food, he's just looking for a reason not to work hard! What to do? He insisted on withdrawing from the public canteen and starting his own cooking. At first, the work team cadres tried to persuade him, telling him that it would be more inconvenient for him to do so, and that it would be better to eat in the canteen, where life, meetings, and work were all convenient. If there were really shortcomings in the canteen food, ways could be found to improve it. But he never mentioned any specific problems with the food, only insisting on withdrawing. Later, the cadres came to ask me, and I said, what can we do? Joining the public canteen is voluntary, and withdrawing is also completely free. You should have approved it long ago. Quickly issue him oil, salt, and rice according to the supply standards, and also educate him about work matters. And so, his family left the public canteen! Later... Well, later we should let the 'little sister' tell us."

    By this time, the ferry had reached the opposite bank, but the people there hadn't come over yet, and the boat was still waiting there at the shore. The old boatman steering the boat didn't like to row an empty boat.

    "Later... not long after he withdrew, he slowly began to feel bad. At that time, we did as Secretary Tian said, giving him all the oil, salt, and rice he was entitled to, and even allowing him to pick some vegetables from the canteen. At first, it wasn't obvious, but later we heard his wife arguing with him. Yes, Chen Mandie didn't care about anything all day long, and got up just to eat; but his wife, Auntie Man, had to get up before dawn every day to prepare the meal. Often, the people in our canteen had already finished breakfast and gone to the fields, but their family's meal wasn't even cooked yet! Auntie Man is also a person who cares about face, and she also has to do agricultural work. How can she possibly do that? As for Mandie, he doesn't care about working late every day. Also, when others finish work, they sit down in the canteen, and the food is already on the table. After eating, they don't even have to wash the dishes, they just take a bath, change clothes, and go to the threshing ground to cool off and sing flower-drum operas. But what about Auntie Man? After work, she still has to cook for the whole family, and isn't busy until the moon is overhead! Not to mention washing several sets of clothes at night. If I were Auntie Man, I would make a fuss too!" You could tell that the girl's words were becoming more and more excited, and she naturally raised her voice.

    "It's really self-inflicted trouble!" I said.

    "Chen Mandie tasted the 'freedom'. In less than a month, his wife forced him to find the canteen leader, saying that he had to rejoin the public canteen. Who knew that the people in the canteen all disagreed when they heard about it, fearing that he would make trouble again, and they all said they didn't want to be partners with such a lazy person! Auntie Man cried when she heard this. Chen Mandie probably also realized how unpopular a lazy person is. He submitted two more applications in a row, determined to come back!" The girl said, picking up the bamboo basket and standing up. We looked up and saw that the ferry had already reached the middle of the river and was coming towards us. Old Tian also stood up suddenly, patted the dirt off his body, and said:

    "How can we not let him come back? Chen Mandie is also from a working-class background, but he just has ideological problems and doesn't like to work. This is a matter of internal contradictions among the people! When the people from their canteen came to ask me what to do, I immediately agreed that he should be allowed to come back, and a good table should be arranged for his family immediately, so that they can enjoy the superiority of our public canteen again and see who our public canteen is actually for!"

    "Secretary Tian, it was so funny the day Chen Mandie returned to the canteen. Auntie Man had a face full of joy and smiled at everyone she saw. Chen Mandie sat there without saying a word, burying his head in his rice bowl. That day, the students had caught a lot of frogs, and we cooked a meal of frog legs as a side dish. I even gave the Chen family some extra..." The girl's voice stopped, and the boat had landed. We quickly jumped onto the ferry. Old Tian turned to her and said, "The supply and marketing cooperative is now collecting frogs. The students shouldn't keep all the frogs they catch for our canteen to eat! Look, we're eating tofu and frogs, and we can pick vegetables at will. Don't forget, we still have to support the cities!"

    I couldn't help but laugh. At this time, Old Tian took the oar from the old boatman without saying a word and began to row. I looked at the water under the boat, which was clear and transparent, and also frighteningly deep. Suddenly, an unknown waterbird broke the brief silence, flapping its wings and passing in front of us. Old Tian also looked at the departing waterbird, not forgetting what he had just said about the public canteen. He said to himself, "Yes, going to socialism and taking the road of collectivization is like taking this ferry. Those who want to board the boat can get ashore immediately!"

    Hearing his meaningful words, I couldn't help but look at him. His hands were rhythmically swinging the oar. Perhaps he was exerting too much force, and I only felt that the small ferry was gently swaying, but the small boat was also moving faster....

    渡口
    湖南长沙?梨公社　伍建新
    初秋，早晨的太阳还是很灼热的。我一路跟着我们生产队的支部书记老田从猪场出来，到了浏阳河边的时候我们的上衣已经被汗水湿透了。
    我们就要从这里过河到对岸去。浏阳河走到这里要拐一个大弯，渡口恰好设在这转弯处，因此本来就不算窄的浏阳河更显得宽阔了。
    “渡船刚过去，又得要在这里等了！”我顺着老田说的望过去，果然那只带篷的小渡船正在河心飘摇着……。
    河滩上坡有一片年青的竹林，中间还夹杂着一株高大的樟木树，我们遥奔那树下而去，这时我们才发现树下浓荫处已经坐着一个歇凉的年青的姑娘，她身旁左边放了一把青布伞，右边放了一只竹编的菜篮子，里面放了几只空碗和一个油瓶子。
    “田支书，过河吗？”姑娘原来也认识老田。
    “是的了，你到供销社去买豆腐吗？”他一边说着，一边也坐在了树荫下，又接着对我说：“坐下歇歇凉吧，这个细妹子是个食堂的事务长，咱们这个队三十几个公共食堂差不多都选的是这些年青人当事务长。很多都是高小毕业生，有点文化，因为办公共食堂总要写个账记个什么的，没有点文化也真不行。”
    我看了看那位细妹子，可不是吗，胖胖的小圆脸，看上去顶多也不过十五六岁。
    “你们食堂里多少天吃一顿豆腐呀？”我问她。
    “一个星期左右就可以吃上一顿。”
    “不办公共食堂的时候呢？哼，恐怕有的人几个月也吃不上一顿吧！”老田究竟还是个年青人，除了待人热情以外，连说话也是抢着讲，唯恐别人把话都讲完了没有自己说的了。他又接着问：“我问你，细妹子，你们食堂那个陈满爹怎么样了？”
      “怎么样了？刚回来几天还看不出个名堂来。反正食堂里的群众都不高兴他回来。都说，没有你们这一家，公共食堂更安静，少麻烦。再说，说参加就参加，闹退出去，马上就退出去，也有点太‘自由’了！可是……”姑娘的话还没说完，老田又回过头来跟我说：“你还不知道吧，这是一个多月以前的事了。这个陈满爹是个上升户，自己有点果树，有几间不细的房子，生活一向很好过。按年岁，今年也不过四十，就是不乐意好好劳动。从打吃公共食堂的饭起，就听到他嚷嚷饭菜不如意，整天跟厨房的人闹。其实他不一定嫌饭菜不顺口，只是找个理由不好好出工罢了！怎么办呢？他闹着要退出公共食堂，自己另起炉灶。起初作业组的干部们还劝说他，告诉他那样他会更不方便，不如在食堂里开饭，生活、开会、出工都合适，如果食堂的饭菜真有缺点，还是可以想办法改进的。可是他始终对饭菜好坏提不出什么名堂来，只是一味地闹着要退出去。后来，干部们来问我，我就说，那有什么办法呢，参加公共食堂是自愿的，退出去也完全有自由，你们早就应该批准他。赶快按着供给标准把油、盐、米发给他，至于出工的事也要对他进行教育。就这样，他们一家人离开了公共食堂！到后来……对了，以后应该让细妹子给我们讲讲了。”
    这时渡船已经到了对岸，只是那面还没有过河的人到这面来，船仍然靠在岸上在那里等着。渡船上掌舵的那个老官子是不轻易划空船的。
    “以后……从退出来不久，他就慢慢感到不是滋味了。当时我们按照田支书说的办了，油、盐、米一样也没少他的，还准许他摘点食堂的菜吃。起初还没显形，后来就听到他堂客跟他吵了起来。是呀，陈满爹整天啥事也不管，起来了就要饭吃；可是他堂客满嫂子，每天天不亮就得起来，准备饭，往往我们食堂里的人都吃完早饭下地了，他们家的饭还没熟呢！满嫂子又是个要面子的人，她还得出农业工，你看这怎末能下得了地？至于满爹，他没皮没脸的每天出晚工也毫不在乎。还有，别人散了工往食堂一坐，饭菜都已经在桌子上摆好了。吃完了饭连碗筷都不用刷，各自洗澡、换衣服，到禾场上歇凉、唱花鼓戏去了。可是满嫂子呢？下了工还得给一家人做饭，那一天不忙到月当头啊！更甭说夜里还要洗几身衣服了，我若是满嫂子，我也要闹！”听得出姑娘的话越讲越激动了，很自然地也提高了嗓门。
    “真是自寻苦恼呀！”我说。
    “陈满爹是尝到‘自由’的味道了，不到一个月他堂客就逼着他来找食堂负责人，说什么也要回来参加公共食堂。谁知食堂的群众听说了都不同意，怕他再闹，也都说不愿意跟这么一个不爱劳动的人作伙伴！满嫂子听到这话哭了一场，大概陈满爹也感到了一个不爱劳动的人是多么不得人心了，他接连着又提出了两次申请，坚决要回来！”姑娘说着提起竹篮子站了起来，我们抬头一望，原来渡船已经划到河心正往这面而来。老田也一下子站了起来，拍打拍打了身上的土说：
    “不让他回来怎么行呢？陈满爹也是个劳动出身的人，只不过是思想有问题，不爱劳动，这是人民内部矛盾?！他们食堂的人又来问我怎么办的时候，我一口就答应了，应该让他回来，马上给他们一家人安排个好桌位，让他们再来享受享受咱们这公共食堂的优越性，看看咱们这公共食堂究竟是为谁办的吧！”
    “田支书，陈满爹回食堂的那一天可有趣了，满嫂子是一脸的欢喜，见了人就笑。陈满爹坐在那里一言不发，把头都埋在饭碗里了。这一天恰好学生们捉了不少青蛙来，我们烧了一顿田鸡作小菜吃，我还特意给他们陈家多盛了点……”姑娘的话音刚住，船已靠岸了，我们连忙跳上了渡船，老田又转身对她说：“供销社现在收田鸡了，小学生们捉了田鸡不要都放在咱们食堂自己吃了！你看看，又吃豆腐、又吃田鸡，蔬菜又可以随便顺手摘，别忘了，我们还得要支援城市呢！”
    我听了不由得笑了。这时老田从掌舵的老官子手里接过了木桨，不声不响地划起来了。我望望船下的水，水清的透明，也深得怕人，忽然一只不知名的水鸟打破了这短暂的寂静，它拍打着水面从我们眼前掠过。老田也看了看那远去的水鸟，还没有忘记刚才说的公共食堂那件事，又自言自语地说：“是呀，到社会主义去，走集体化的路，也就像乘这渡船一样，愿意上船来的，马上也就可以上岸了！”
    听了他这意味深长的话，我不由得朝他望去，他摇桨的双手正有规则地摆动着，也许他用力过大了，我只觉得这小渡船已经轻轻地摇摆起来，然而这小船也走得更快了……。
