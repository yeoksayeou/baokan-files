Recently, we investigated 141 public canteens in eight brigades (including plain areas, mountainous areas, rich teams, and poor teams) in Linli County, Hunan. Although these canteens have only been around for a year, they have been praised by everyone.

Saving a Large Amount of Labor for Production

In the past, each household needed one or two people to grow vegetables, collect firewood, and cook, occupying too many people, which was no longer in line with the situation of the Great Leap Forward. The broad masses clearly saw this problem, so public canteens sprung up everywhere as soon as the people's communes were established.

The scale of the public canteens in Linli County is generally 20 to 30 households. The work of cooking for 20 to 30 people in the past has now been replaced by three or four people, and the rest are all directly involved in production. Because meals are concentrated, and the time is consistent, the problem of late work and early closing is solved; in sparsely populated areas and during busy farming seasons, the method of delivering meals greatly shortens the round trip; households no longer need to worry about firewood, rice, oil, salt, and vegetables, so that everyone can concentrate on production, and the efficiency of production is greatly improved. In places where public canteens are vigorously developed, there are the following characteristics: ① The winter water conservancy projects and deep plowing tasks in 1958 increased by about five times compared with 1957; ② The agricultural activities in 1959 were done more and better than last year; ③ The population that has been invested in national industrial construction for a long time accounts for about 5% of the total labor force, and they are all the main labor force; ④ In 1959, we encountered a major drought that had not occurred in nearly 30 years, and it lasted for more than 60 days, achieving drought resistance and ensuring a good harvest. The total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production of these eight teams this year is estimated to increase by more than 10% to 20-30% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

The habit of one family and one set of pots and stoves passed down from generation to generation not only occupied a lot of labor solely for the sake of eating, but also greatly restricted the freedom of countless women to choose social occupations. The establishment of public canteens effectively solved this problem. There were originally 4,366 sets of pots and stoves in these eight brigades, and 5,675 women revolved around these pots and stoves. Now, in addition to the 699 people who are retained to specialize in canteen work according to their respective hobbies and specialties, the remaining more than 4,900 women are free from entanglement and happily participate in various production activities. This part of the women accounts for 40.3% of the total labor force currently directly involved in production in the eight brigades. The liberation of women from housework is not just a problem of increasing the proportion of labor, but also contains far-reaching significance in many aspects. In just one year, many women have become pioneers on the production front, and some of them have become "rice planting pioneers", "plowing champions", and "harvesting experts". Because a large number of female laborers are put into production, it is more conditional to draw male laborers into industrial construction for a long time; it is also possible to send some young men and women to various institutions of higher learning and secondary schools for further study. Because of this, women's economic status in the family has been improved a step further. Now it can be said that men and women are truly equal.

Facilitating Planned Grain Consumption

In Yangqiao Production Team of Yanggang Brigade, there was a commune member named Liu Ronggu, whose family of six people received a total of 3,000 catties of grain from the autumn harvest of 1957 to the eve of the autumn harvest of 1958, but the whole year was short of 420 catties of grain. Is the grain ration standard too low? No. Was there any accidental loss? No, either. The reasons are as follows: ① Too much grain was used as non-staple food; ② Less vegetables were eaten, so the consumption of grain was relatively high; ③ Cooking was unplanned; ④ Grain was used to feed cats, dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks; ⑤ Poor storage, some grain was consumed by rats and became moldy. In early September last year, this household joined the public canteen. The result of the accounting over the past year is that not only did it not exceed the grain ration standard, but it also saved 43 and a half catties of rice, and the couple no longer quarreled over the grain consumption issue.

This is just one example among many households. According to the understanding of 72 public canteens belonging to Hucheng, Yanggang, Dongping, and Qianfeng brigades, among 2,511 households, from January to August 1958, in the eight months of cooking their own meals, 40.9% of the households exceeded the standard due to poor planning and management, with a shortage of more than 40,000 catties of grain; after vigorously running public canteens, measures such as "planned grain consumption, graded quotas, indicators to households, more food during busy periods, less food during slack periods, meal tickets, and self-management of savings" were adopted, which not only ensured that everyone had enough to eat every meal, but also saved more than 24,000 catties of grain for 2,611 households when the accounts were settled at the end of August this year, and the savings households accounted for 61.7% of the total number of households.

Sufficient Vegetables, Many Varieties, and Good Taste

According to the statistics of 141 public canteens in these eight brigades, on average, 20 canteens eat four dishes per meal throughout the year, 58 canteens eat three dishes, and 53 canteens eat two and a half dishes, accounting for 92.8% of the total number of canteens; 10 canteens eat an average of only one and a half to two dishes per meal because of less vegetable planting or less harvest due to drought. Even such canteens are still very satisfied with the masses. They recalled that in previous years when there was a severe drought, not only were vegetables scarce, but even drinking water was difficult.

Generally, the quantity of vegetables can not only meet the needs, but also the varieties are many and the taste is good. The stewards and cooks of each canteen often solicit opinions from everyone, find out everyone's taste, and exchange cooking experience, so that everyone can eat comfortably. For example, the Xianfeng Canteen of Dongping Brigade has made more than ten kinds of radish dishes, such as stewed radish, fried shredded radish, dried radish, salted radish, soy sauce radish, spicy radish, and sour radish. Another example is the Sijihong Canteen of Hucheng Brigade, which sells excess vegetables and buys back tempeh, vermicelli, tofu, chili sauce, Su radish and other foreign dishes to eat with them. Another example is the first and second canteens of Qianfeng Brigade, which also have salted vegetable seats, light vegetable seats, seats with chili, and seats without chili.... Under realistic conditions, it is indeed delicious and satisfactory.

Eating meat and adding dishes is not only the case during the New Year and holidays, but also common at ordinary times. Collective eating of meat, fish, and other large meals generally occurs about fifteen times a year, and the least is also seven times. More than 16,000 people in the eight brigades ate more than 66,000 catties of pork and fish in the canteen throughout the year, an average of 4.1 catties per person, an increase of 1.25 times compared to the previous year.

The issue of drinking tea and water seems to be a small matter, but public canteens also give it due attention. Ginger tea, tea leaf tea, saltwater tea, pao fu tea, cold tea, spring water tea... do as much as you can. Washing water, foot washing water, bath water, laundry water... can be taken at will. Many canteens also disinfect drinking water and implement self-flowing water collection.

Such days are not only unanimously praised by poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, but even the upper-middle peasants who live a relatively prosperous life have also admitted defeat in the face of facts. Yang Changjing, an upper-middle peasant from Dongping Brigade, said: "Our life was indeed not bad in the past, but how can it compare with public canteens?"

Catering to the Living Habits of the Masses

Each public canteen pays special attention to the living habits and special needs of the masses and properly solves various problems. For children who cannot be taken care of by their mothers, there are special people to feed them; for the elderly, the sick, the disabled, and pregnant women, according to their preferences, they make noodles, porridge and other dishes that suit their tastes. They can eat in the canteen, or they can be delivered to their homes, and they are also allowed to cook separately at home; during the New Year and holidays, there is plenty of meat and fish, and some canteens also hunt wild chickens and game, make steamed buns, dumplings, and are equipped with scallions, garlic, sauce, vinegar, and wine. Those who are willing to eat in the canteen will have a "grand reunion", and those who are willing to take them home to eat will enjoy a "family happiness"; commune members' guests also become honored guests of the public canteen.

Everyone's living hobbies are not the same, and economic conditions and regional conditions are also different. In order to take care of personal living habits, many canteens also have small shops selling cigarettes, alcohol, and meat dishes; some also distribute some firewood for heating, adding meals, and boiling tea to facilitate commune members; each commune allows everyone to use their spare time to plant some vegetables and tobacco in the gaps for their own consumption; the grain saved according to the standard is returned to everyone on time, and money is given if money is needed, and grain is given if grain is needed.

Such meticulous care makes the broad masses feel satisfied. Many commune members have written poems and lyrics to praise the canteen.

Within one year, the cooks of the 141 public canteens in these eight brigades combined their professional work to raise 2,000 pigs and more than 940,000 fish, and 46 public canteens sold the vegetables they could not finish for more than 5,200 yuan. These three items alone were worth more than 128,000 yuan, which is equivalent to an average increase in income of 30 yuan per household, and accumulated more than 52 million catties of refined fertilizer for agricultural production. People say: Public canteens are infinitely good.

    公共食堂无限好
    王明江  周泽富
    最近，我们在湖南临澧县调查了八个大队（包括平原区、山区，富队、穷队）的一百四十一个公共食堂。这些食堂虽然只有一年的历史，但是得到了众口称赞。
    节省大批劳力投入生产
    以往，每一户人家都要有一至两个人种菜、打柴火、做饭，占用人员过多，这已经不符合大跃进的形势了。广大群众很清楚的看准了这个问题，所以人民公社刚成立，公共食堂就遍地开花。
    临澧县公共食堂的规模，一般是二三十户，过去二三十个人作饭的工作已经由三四个人所代替了，其余的人就全部直接投入了生产。由于集中开饭，时间一致，解决了迟出工早收工的问题；在居住分散的地区和农忙的日子里，通过送饭的办法，大大缩短了出归往返的行程；家家户户再也不需要为柴米油盐菜而发愁，使每一个人都能集中精力从事生产，生产工效因而大大提高。在大办公共食堂的地方，都有以下几个特点：①1958年冬修水利工程和深耕任务，比1957年增加了五倍左右；②1959年的农事活动作得比去年更多更好；③长期投入国家工业建设的人口占总劳力的5％左右，并且都是主要劳动力；④1959年碰上了近三十多年来未有的大旱，前后干旱了六十多天，作到了抗旱保丰收。这八个队今年农、林、牧、副、渔生产的总产值，估计比大跃进的1958年增长一成多到二三成。
    祖祖辈辈流传下来的一家一户一套锅灶的习惯，不仅单纯为了吃饭问题而占用了不少的劳力，而且大大的束缚了无数妇女群众选择社会职业的自由。公共食堂的举办，有效的解决了这个问题。这八个大队原来共有四千三百六十六套锅灶，有五千六百七十五个妇女围着这些锅灶转。现在除了根据各自的爱好和特长留下六百九十九人专门从事食堂工作外，其余的四千九百多名妇女都身无所缠、兴高彩烈地参加了各项生产活动。这一部分妇女占八个大队现在直接投入生产劳力总数的40.3％。妇女摆脱家务劳动，这不单是一个劳动比例提高的问题，它还包含着多方面的深远意义。才不过一年的时间，就有不少妇女已经成了生产战线上的尖兵，她们之中有人成为“插秧先锋”、“犁田健将”、“收割神手”。由于妇女劳力大批投入生产，才更有条件抽出男劳力长期转入工业建设；才有可能保送一部分青年男女投入各类高、中等学校进行深造。正因为这样，妇女在家庭中的经济地位又提高了一步，现在可以说男女真正平等了。
    便于执行计划用粮
    杨岗大队杨桥生产队，有个社员叫刘绒姑，一家大小共六口人，1957年秋收起到1958年秋收前夕止，共分口粮三千斤，结果全年差四百二十斤口粮。是不是口粮标准低了呢？不是。是不是遭受了异外损失呢？也没有。原因有以下几条：①把粮食过多的作了副食品；②吃菜少，相对口粮消耗就多；③煮饭无计划；④用粮食喂猫、狗猪和鸡鸭等牲畜；⑤保管不善，鼠耗、霉烂了一些。去年9月初，这个户加入了公共食堂，一年来算账的结果，不仅没有超过口粮标准，还节省了四十三斤半米，夫妻之间再也不为用粮问题争吵了。
    这仅是很多户中的一个例子。据护城、杨岗、洞平、前锋等四个大队所属七十二个公共食堂的了解，二千五百一十一户当中，在1958年1至8月份，各自做饭的八个月里，由于计划不周、管理不善等原因，口粮超过标准户达40.9％，不足粮食四万多斤；大办公共食堂之后，采取“计划用粮，分等定量，指标到户，忙时多吃，闲时少吃，凭票开餐，节余自理”等办法，不仅保证人人餐餐吃饱，在今年8月底结帐时，有二千六百一十一户节余口粮二万四千多斤，节约户占总户数的61.7％。
    菜蔬足、花样多、味口好
    据这八个大队的一百四十一个公共食堂的统计，全年平均每餐吃四个菜的有二十个食堂，吃三个菜的有五十八个食堂，吃二个半菜的有五十三个食堂，以上占食堂总数的92.8％；有十个食堂因为天旱种菜少或收获量少，平均每餐只吃一个半菜到两个菜。就是这样的食堂，群众仍然很满意。他们回忆往年天大旱时，不仅蔬菜奇缺，而且吃水都很困难。
    蔬菜一般不仅数量能够满足需要，而且花样多，味口也做得好。各食堂的事务长和炊事员经常征求大家的意见，摸清大家的味口，交流做菜经验，使人人都吃得舒适。如洞平大队的先锋食堂，仅萝卜一项就做出了燉萝卜、炒萝卜丝、萝卜干、盐萝卜、酱萝卜、辣萝卜、酸萝卜等十多种。又如护城大队的四季红食堂，把多余的蔬菜出卖之后，买回豆豉、粉条、豆腐、辣子酱、苏萝卜等外来菜夹着吃。再如前锋大队的第一、二食堂还设有咸菜席、淡菜席、掺辣椒的席、无辣椒的席……。在现实条件下，的确是做到了样样可口，令人满意。
    吃晕、加菜，不仅过年过节如此，就是平时也不少见。集体吃肉、吃鱼等大晕，一年之内一般在十五次左右，最少的也吃了七次。八个大队所属的一万六千多人，一年内在食堂共吃猪肉和鱼六万六千多斤，每人平均四点一斤，比前一年增长了一点二五倍。
    喝茶用水问题，看来是些小事，但公共食堂同样给予了应有的重视。生姜茶、茶叶茶、盐水茶、泡伏茶、冷凉茶、泉水茶……，能办到尽量办到。洗脸水、洗脚水、洗澡水、洗衣水……任意取用。不少的食堂还作到了吃水消毒，取水实行自流。
    这样的日子，不仅贫农和新老下中农一致称好，就连生活过得比较富裕的上中农也纷纷在事实面前认输。洞平大队上中农杨昌敬说：“过去我们的生活确实过得不差，但是怎能比得上公共食堂呢？”
    照顾群众生活习惯
    各个公共食堂，都特别注意群众生活习惯和特殊需要，妥善解决了各种问题。对母亲照料不过来的小孩，设有专人喂饭；对老年、病者、残疾和孕妇，按照各人的喜爱，做有面食、稀饭等适合口味的饭菜，到食堂吃也行，送到家里也可，自己在家单独做也允许；过年过节，办有大肉大鱼，有些食堂还猎有山鸡野味，做了馒头、包子，葱、蒜、酱、醋、酒齐备，愿在食堂吃的就搞“大团圆”，愿取回家去吃者则享“全家福”；社员来客，也成为公共食堂的贵宾。
    每个人的生活爱好不是那么一样，经济条件和地区条件也有一些差别，为了照顾个人的生活习惯，很多食堂还设有小卖部，卖烟、卖酒、卖荤菜；有的还发给部分柴火、供烤火、加餐、煮茶等用，给社员以方便；各公社都允许大家利用业余时间在隙地上种些蔬菜、烟草，以备自己食用；按照标准节余的口粮，按时由大家领回去，要钱给钱，要粮给粮。
    这种无微不至的照顾，广大群众无不心满意足。许多社员写了诗词赞扬食堂。
    这八个大队的一百四十一个公共食堂，一年内，炊事员结合自己的业务工作养猪达两千头，养鱼九十四万多尾，还有四十六个公共食堂把吃不完的蔬菜卖了五千二百多块钱，仅此三项共值十二万八千多元，等于每户平均增加收入三十元，并且给农业生产积了五千二百多万斤精肥。人们都说：公共食堂无限好。
