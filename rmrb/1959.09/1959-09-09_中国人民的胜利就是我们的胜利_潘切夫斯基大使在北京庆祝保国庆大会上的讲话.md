Most respected Vice Premier Bo Yibo, dear comrades and friends:

The joyful and happy Bulgarian people will solemnly celebrate their greatest national holiday – September 9th – tomorrow.

Fifteen years ago, on September 9th, 1944, our people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and under the banner of the Fatherland Front, united all patriotic forces in the country, staged an armed uprising, overthrew the royal fascist dictatorship, and established a people's democratic regime.

Our people were able to achieve the victory of September 9th due to the great victory of the Soviet army during World War II, and the powerful, thorough, and fatal blow dealt to Hitler's elite fascist troops by the rapid advance of the Soviet army in the Balkans in the second half of 1944.

Our people were able to achieve the victory of September 9th due to the revolutionary struggle of the working people, led by the working class and its vanguard – the Bulgarian Communist Party – against fascism and capitalism for decades. In these revolutionary struggles, thousands of loyal sons and daughters of the people sacrificed their lives for the freedom and happiness of the motherland and its people.

	The September 9th People's Uprising was the glorious beginning of our socialist revolution.

In the fifteen years of the people's regime, our people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, have carried out heroic struggles and completed profound social, economic, and cultural transformations. In this transformation, our country has maintained the closest friendship and cooperation with the great Soviet Union, and close cooperation with the 650 million Chinese people and the people of other socialist countries.

Georgi Dimitrov, the great son, mentor, and leader of the Bulgarian people, put forward the task to us in the earliest years of the people's regime: "…to complete the undertakings that other countries needed a whole century to complete under different conditions in fifteen to twenty years through national industrialization and electrification, and agricultural mechanization." Now, on the glorious fifteenth anniversary, the Bulgarian people can proudly and certainly say that this historically significant task is being well accomplished. In the era of the people's regime, the socialist transformation of the entire national economy has fundamentally changed the face of our country. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has transformed from a backward agricultural country before liberation into a socialist industrial-agricultural country with large-scale collectivized and mechanized agriculture.

The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party confirmed that socialism has achieved victory in our industry, commerce, and financial credit, as well as in the most difficult economic sector – agriculture. At the end of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1957, socialist components accounted for 98% of industrial output value, more than 90% of agricultural output value, 99% of retail commodity turnover, and more than 93% of national income. Due to the rapid development of our economy in the past year and a half, these percentages have further increased.

In the era of the people's regime, Bulgaria established its own heavy industry, and now it has its own machine manufacturing industry, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industry, chemical industry, developed power base, and other industrial sectors that did not exist before September 9th, 1944. Before 1939, the ratio of industrial and agricultural output value was 25 to 75, with agriculture dominating. By 1958, although the absolute numbers of agricultural production had increased, the ratio of industrial and agricultural output value was 69 to 31, with industry dominating. The total national industrial output value in 1958 increased by about eight times compared to 1939. The output of major sectors of heavy industry increased as follows: electricity production in 1958 was more than ten times that of 1939, ferrous metallurgy about thirty-nine times, non-ferrous metallurgy about one hundred and nineteen times, the chemical industry nineteen times, machine manufacturing six times, and the building materials industry fifteen times, etc. Due to such rapid development, the People's Republic of Bulgaria now possesses an industrial foundation that ensures the further rapid development of the national economy.

Today, fifteen years ago, the Bulgarian countryside was in a state of depression and bankruptcy, agricultural technology was primitive and backward, and the countryside was full of scattered small landholdings. Our party creatively applied Lenin's collectivization plan and the experience of the Soviet Union in building collective farms, and relying on the achievements of socialist industrialization, formulated and implemented the general line of carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture through agricultural production cooperatives. So far, 95% of the country's cultivated land has joined 975 large-scale agricultural production cooperatives, each with an average of 4,500 hectares of land. This shows that socialism has achieved victory in the Bulgarian countryside. Agricultural collectivization has created conditions for the rapid mechanization of agriculture and the large-scale adoption of agricultural technology measures, in order to increase production and increase the income of cooperative members. At the end of 1958, on average, each agricultural production cooperative had thirty tractors, six combine harvesters, five tractor-drawn threshers, seven trucks, and other modern agricultural equipment. This fact illustrates the degree of mechanization of agriculture in our country.

Based on profound social and economic transformations, our country has carried out a cultural revolution including the broadest masses. Illiteracy among people under the age of fifty has been completely eliminated. In terms of the development of education, Bulgaria already ranks among the top in the world. Currently, in our country, for every thousand people, there are one hundred and seventy-three people studying in regular primary and secondary schools, vocational schools, and universities. If we add the number of people in off-the-job training courses, study groups, and other learning methods, this number will be much larger.

The tremendous victories achieved in the national economy have had a significant impact on improving the material welfare of the working people and raising their cultural level. Due to the rapid increase in productivity, the national income of the whole country has increased by more than 1.5 times compared to 1939. Housing construction, public utilities, and welfare construction are being carried out on a large scale, and electricity is increasingly popular in the lives of urban and rural residents. Universal free medical care is a great achievement of our people in cultural life, which is enough to arouse the envy of any capitalist country. The development of healthcare also ranks among the top in the world. The same is true for the cause of preferential treatment. For the first time in our history, our country provides pensions to elderly members of agricultural production cooperatives. The above information and many other aspects clearly show that the Bulgarian people now live much better than they did in bourgeois Bulgaria.

Since 1958, the economic development of our country has entered a new stage. The great achievements of socialist construction and the wise leadership of our Communist Party have created material and political prerequisites for our country to make new and greater leaps forward.

Inspired by the brilliant prospects formulated by the Seventh Congress of the Party and the overall high tide of the entire socialist camp, the Bulgarian working people have launched a massive movement to strive to complete the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held in October and November last year and January this year confirmed that the national economy has accumulated considerable reserves, enabling our country to develop at a higher speed, and put forward the task of completing the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years.

At the same time, the Central Committee also formulated a long-term plan for vigorously developing the national economy and further maximizing the material and cultural conditions of the working people before 1965. The implementation of this plan will enable our country to complete socialist construction in the next few years and begin the transition to building a communist society. This grand plan envisages that the total industrial and agricultural output value and national income in 1965 will increase by two to three times compared to 1957, and Bulgaria will rank among the top in the world in terms of consumption level and meeting the material and cultural needs of the people.

On the occasion of celebrating the glorious 15th anniversary of its liberation, the Bulgarian people express their deep gratitude to the fraternal Soviet people and the great Soviet Communist Party, and sincerely thank them for their assistance and support in our people's struggle for liberation and socialist construction.

The Bulgarian people remember and will always remember that without the tremendous political, economic, scientific, technological, and cultural assistance of the Soviet Union, and without the fraternal assistance and cooperation of the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries, it would be unimaginable for us to achieve such achievements on the road to socialism.

In order to realize the great tasks of building socialism and communism in our country, peace in the Balkans and the world is needed. Therefore, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, have consistently and unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy from the first day of the establishment of the people's regime. This policy is determined by the essence of our people's democratic regime, and it is fully in line with the interests of socialist construction and the interests of all peace-loving people. Bulgaria supports all peaceful initiatives aimed at banning atomic weapons, reducing armaments and armed forces, and consolidating peace in the Balkans and the world. Our people warmly support Comrade Khrushchev's statement at the mass rally in Tirana that the Balkans, which used to be considered the powder keg of Europe, should become a region of lasting peace, a zone without atomic weapons and rocket bases.

The recent proposal of our government to the Greek government on concluding a treaty of mutual non-aggression between the two countries is a vivid example of our people's peace-loving policy. Regrettably, the Greek side rejected this proposal. The negative attitude of the Greek government towards this peace-loving proposal of our government clearly shows who wants peace and who opposes peace.

The People's Republic of Bulgaria is loyal to its peace-loving foreign policy and fully and unreservedly supports all peaceful initiatives and proposals of the Soviet Union aimed at safeguarding world peace and security. Therefore, the Bulgarian people welcome with great joy the news that Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Comrade Khrushchev and US President Eisenhower will conduct mutual visits. The Bulgarian people believe that this meeting will ease international tensions and open up new prospects for the further peaceful development of all countries.

Dear comrades and friends:

In three weeks, the great Chinese people will enthusiastically celebrate the brilliant tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We are all witnesses to the great victorious advance of China in the past decade. In the past decade, it has transformed into a powerful socialist country - a loyal defender of peace in the Far East and the world. The imperialist attempts to prevent the victorious advance of China with hundreds of millions of people, to obstruct the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their sacred territory Taiwan and other islands occupied by the United States, and to realize the great reunification of the motherland, will inevitably be shamefully defeated.

The Bulgarian people welcome with great joy the tremendous and comprehensive victory of the 650 million Chinese people. The inexhaustible creative power and enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people in various mass movements, especially in the Great Leap Forward movement in 1958 and the leap forward which is now continuing with unabated drive, inspire the Bulgarian people. Our people regard these victories as their own victories, because there is an inseparable deep fraternal friendship between our two peoples, and the foundation of this friendship is the common ideology of the invincible Marxist-Leninist doctrine and the common goal of building socialism and communism in our two countries. Here I would like to especially joyfully point out that the fraternal friendship between the Bulgarian and Chinese peoples is growing and strengthening day by day, and this friendship and comprehensive cooperation will continue to develop and strengthen in our common progress and in the common struggle for peace and socialism.

Long live the great Chinese people and the leader of the great Chinese people, Mao Zedong!

Long live the People's Republic of China and President of the Republic, Liu Shaoqi!

Long live the unity of the powerful socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union!

Long live the eternal fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Bulgarian and Chinese peoples!

Long live world peace!

### 中国人民的胜利就是我们的胜利  潘切夫斯基大使在北京庆祝保国庆大会上的讲话

    中国人民的胜利就是我们的胜利
    潘切夫斯基大使在北京庆祝保国庆大会上的讲话最尊敬的薄一波副总理同志，敬爱的同志们和朋友们：
    欢乐和幸福的保加利亚人民在明天将隆重地庆祝自己最伟大的全民节日——9月9日。
    十五年前，1944年9月9日那一天，我国人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，在祖国阵线的旗帜下，团结了全国一切爱国力量，举行了武装起义，推翻了保皇法西斯专政，建立了人民民主政权。
    我国人民所以能取得9月9日的胜利，是由于苏联军队在第二次世界大战期间的伟大胜利，和苏军在1944年下半年在巴尔干迅速挺进中给希特勒法西斯的精锐部队有力、彻底、致命打击的结果。
    我国人民所以能取得9月9日的胜利是由于以工人阶级为首的劳动人民在工人阶级先锋队——保加利亚共产党的领导下，进行了几十年反对法西斯和反对资本主义的革命斗争
  的结果。在这些革命斗争中，千万个人民的忠实儿女曾为祖
  国人民的自由和幸福献出了生命。
      9月9日的人民起义是我国社会主义革命光辉的开端。
    人民政权的十五年来，我国人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，进行了英勇的斗争，完成了深刻的社会、经济和文化改造。在这一改造中，我国同伟大苏联保持最密切的友谊和合作，同六亿五千万中国人民以及其他社会主义国家人民进行了密切的合作。
    保加利亚人民的伟大儿子、导师和领袖格奥尔基·季米特洛夫，早在人民政权建立的最初几年就向我们提出了任务：“……通过国家工业化和电气化、农业机械化，在十五年到二十年内完成其他国家在不同条件下需要整个一百年才可完成的事业。”现在，在光荣的十五周年的日子里，保加利亚人民怀着自豪的心情，可以肯定的说，这个具有历史意义的任务正在很好地完成。在人民政权的年代里，对整个国民经济进行的社会主义改造根本改变了我国的面貌。保加利亚人民共和国已经从解放前的落后的农业国变成了拥有大规模合作化和机械化的农业的社会主义工业—农业国家了。
    保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会确认，社会主义已经在我国工业、商业和金融信贷，以及在最艰难的经济部门——农业中取得了胜利。在1957年第二个五年计划结束时，社会主义成份在工业产值中占98％，在农业产值中占90％以上，在零售商品流通额中占99％，在国民收入中，社会主义成份占93％以上。由于最近一年半以来我国经济的迅速发展，现在这些百分比又有所增长。
    在人民政权的年代里，保加利亚建立了本国的重工业，现在它已经有了本国的机器制造业、黑色和有色冶金业、化学工业、发达的动力基地和其他一些1944年9月9日以前所没有的工业部门。1939年以前，工农业产值的比重是二十五比七十五，农业占优势，而到1958年，虽然农业生产绝对数字是增长了，但是工农业产值的比重却是六十九比三十一，工业占了优势。1958年全国工业总产值比1939年增加了约八倍，重工业的主要部门产量增长如下：电力生产1958年是1939年的十倍以上，黑色冶金业约三十九倍，有色冶金业约一百一十九倍，化学工业十九倍，机器制造业六倍，建筑材料工业十五倍等。由于这样迅速的发展，目前保加利亚人民共和国已经拥有确保国民经济进一步迅速发展的工业基础。
  十五年以前的今天，保加利亚农村处于萧条破产的状态，农业技术原始而落后，农村中尽是零散的小土地占有制。我们的党创造性地运用列宁的合作化计划和苏联建设集体农庄的经验，依靠着社会主义工业化的成就，制定并实现了通过农业生产合作社的办法对农业进行社会主义改造的总路线。到目前为止，全国已有95％的耕地加入了九百七十五个大型农业生产合作社，每个社平均有四千五百公顷土地。这说明，社会主义在保加利亚农村中已取得了胜利。农业合作化为农业迅速机械化和大规模采取农业技术措施，以便为提高产量和增加社员收入创造了条件。1958年年底，平均每个农业生产合作社有三十台拖拉机、六台联合收割机、五台机引脱粒机、七辆卡车和其他现代化农具。这一事实说明了我国农业机械化的程度。
    我国在深刻的社会和经济改造的基础上进行了包括最广泛的群众性的文化革命。五十岁以下的文盲已经全部扫除。在教育事业的发展方面，保加利亚已经占世界首位之一。目前我国每一千人中，有一百七十三个人在正规中小学、专业学校和高等学校里学习。如果再算上不脱产的训练班、学习组和其他学习方式的人数，这个数字还会大得多。
    国民经济方面取得的巨大胜利，对改善劳动人民的物质福利状况和提高他们的文化水平起了重要的影响。由于生产力的猛增，全国国民收入比1939年增加了一点五倍以上。住宅建设、公共事业和生活福利建设正在大规模展开，电力日益普及城市和农村居民的生活。全民免费医疗是我国人民在文化生活方面取得的巨大成就，它足以引起任何一个资本主义国家的嫉妒。在保健事业的发展方面，也占世界首位之一。优抚金的事业也是如此。我国在历史上第一次给年老的农业生产合作社社员发养老金。以上资料和许多其他方面的情况都清楚说明，现在保加利亚人民生活比在资产阶级保加利亚时过得好得多。
    从1958年起，我国的经济发展开始了新的阶段。社会主义建设的巨大成就和我国共产党的英明领导，为我国进行新的更大的跃进创造了物质上和政治上的前提。
    在党第七次代表大会所制定的光辉前景和整个社会主义阵营的全面高涨的鼓舞下，保加利亚劳动人民展开了争取提前完成第三个五年计划的声势浩大的运动。保共中央去年10月和11月以及今年1月召开的全体会议确认，国民经济已经积累了相当的后备力量，使我国能以更高的速度向前发展，同时提出了在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划的任务。
    与此同时，中央委员会还拟定了1965年以前大力发展国民经济和进一步最大限度地改善劳动人民的物质和文化状况的远景规划。这个规划的实现将使我国有可能在最近几年内完成社会主义建设并开始向建设共产主义社会过渡。这个规模宏伟的计划预定1965年工农业总产值和国民收入比1957年增加两、三倍，保加利亚将在消费水平和满足人民的物质和文化需要方面占世界首位之一。
    在欢庆自己光荣的解放十五周年之际，保加利亚人民向兄弟的苏联人民和伟大的苏联共产党致以深厚的谢意，衷心感谢他们在我国人民争取解放斗争和社会主义建设时期里给予的帮助和支持。
    保加利亚人民记得并将永远记住，如果没有苏联的巨大的政治、经济、科技和文化援助，没有中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的兄弟般的援助和合作，我们在社会主义道路上取得这样的成就是不可想像的。
    为了实现在我国建设社会主义和共产主义的巨大任务，需要巴尔干和全世界的和平。因此，保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，从人民政权建立的第一天起就一贯地始终不渝地奉行爱好和平的政策。这个政策是我国人民民主政权的本质所决定的，它完全符合于社会主义建设的利益和所有爱好和平人民的利益。保加利亚支持旨在禁止原子武器、削减军备和武装力量、巩固巴尔干和世界和平的一切和平倡议。我国人民热烈拥护赫鲁晓夫同志在地拉那举行的群众大会上所说的，过去被认为是欧洲火药库的巴尔干应该变为持久和平的地区，无原子武器和火箭基地的地带。
    不久以前我国政府致希腊政府的关于缔结两国互不侵犯条约的建议是我国人民爱好和平政策的鲜明例证。遗憾的是希腊方面拒绝了这个建议。希腊政府对我国政府这个爱好和平的建议采取否定态度，清楚说明了什么人要和平，什么人反对和平。
    保加利亚人民共和国忠于自己爱好和平的外交政策，全部地毫无保留地支持苏联旨在维护世界和平和安全的一切和平倡议和建议。因此，保加利亚人民以十分欢欣心情迎接关于苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志同美国总统艾森豪威尔即将进行相互访问的消息。保加利亚人民相信，这次会见将使国际紧张局势得到缓和，将为各国人民进一步的和平发展，开辟新的前景。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    三个星期以后，伟大的中国人民将以欢欣鼓舞的心情来热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国成立光辉的十周年。我们大家都是十年来伟大中国胜利前进的见证人，十年来，它已变为强大的社会主义国家——远东和全世界和平忠实的捍卫者。帝国主义企图阻止几亿人口的中国的胜利前进，阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国恢复合法地位，阻挠中国人民解放自己的神圣领土台湾和美国霸占的其他岛屿以及实现祖国的伟大统一，这些企图必将遭到可耻的失败。
    保加利亚人民以极其喜悦的心情迎接六亿五千万中国人民的巨大的全面胜利。中国人民在各个全民运动，特别是在1958年的大跃进运动和现在继续以不减弱的干劲展开的跃进中所表现的取之不竭的创造力量和热情鼓舞了保加利亚人民。我国人民把这些胜利视为自己的胜利，因为我们两国人民之间有着不可分离的深厚的兄弟友谊，这种友谊的基础是不可战胜的马克思列宁主义学说的共同思想和在我们两国建设社会主义和共产主义的共同目标。这里我要特别高兴地指出，保加利亚人民和中国人民的兄弟友谊与日俱增，日益巩固，而这个友谊和全面合作将在我们共同的前进中和在争取和平和社会主义的共同斗争中得到不断发展和巩固。
    伟大的中国人民和伟大中国人民的领袖毛泽东万岁！
    中华人民共和国和共和国主席刘少奇万岁！
    以伟大苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的团结万岁！
    保中两国人民永恒的兄弟友谊和合作万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
