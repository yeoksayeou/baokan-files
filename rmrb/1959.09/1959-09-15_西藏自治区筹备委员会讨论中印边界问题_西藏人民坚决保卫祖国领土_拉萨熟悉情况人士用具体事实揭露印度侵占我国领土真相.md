Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 14th: The Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region held a meeting on the afternoon of the 12th to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue. Members of the Preparatory Committee in Lhasa, heads of its departments, and people from all walks of life in Lhasa who attended the meeting unanimously expressed their resolute support for the Chinese government's solemn position on the Sino-Indian border issue and expressed their anger and protest against India's encroachment on our country's territory.

The attendees unanimously stated that the Chinese people, and first and foremost the Tibetan people, will never recognize the so-called "McMahon Line." The determination of the Tibetan people to defend the territorial integrity of the motherland is unwavering. Many people also cited facts to expose the truth of the Indian government's encroachment on our country's territory.

Apei Awang Jinmei, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said at the meeting: We Tibetan people are very clear that this so-called McMahon Line is an aggressive line of British imperialism. The Tibetan people oppose it, and the people of the whole country oppose it. He said: Since the liberation of Tibet, although our government has not recognized the so-called McMahon Line, our troops have never crossed the McMahon Line due to our adherence to a policy of friendship and good neighborliness, while Indian troops have gradually encroached on our territory. Who is the aggressor is clear from the facts. He also said: We love peace and cherish Sino-Indian friendship very much, but we will never allow others to invade our territory. The Tibetan people must work together with the people of the whole country to fight for the maintenance of the integrity of the motherland's territorial sovereignty.

Sangpo Caiwang Renzeng, Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, exposed the facts of the Indian government's encroachment on our country's territory. Sangpo Caiwang Renzeng was one of the former Kālons of the Tibetan local government. He said: "The 'Men' region (including Tawang) that has been occupied by India to this day has always been our country's territory. In the 'Men' region, there are also territories and manors that the Tibetan local government distributed to me. Until 1951, the people on these territories paid taxes to me and were under my jurisdiction. The administrative officials of the 'Men' area were also appointed by the Tibetan local authorities. Only after the Indian army invaded did the Indian government insist that this area belonged to India."

Langdun Gongga Wangqiu, a Standing Committee Member who once served as the Silun (whose position was above the Kashag government and only below the Dalai Lama) of the former Tibetan local government, said that although a few reactionary officials of the Tibetan local authorities participated in the Simla Conference at that time, these officials never dared to make the truth of the conference public after returning to Tibet. Not only did they not allow officials of the local government to see the documents of the conference, but they even kept it secret from me, the Silun. This shows that this meeting was not fit to be seen and was illegal. Laman Qingren Luobu, a former official of the Tibetan local government who participated in the Simla Conference as one of the entourage of the representative of the Tibetan local government, also revealed the truth of the Simla Conference at the meeting. Laman Qingren Luobu is the head of the Menzi Kang (the Medical and Calculation Bureau of the former Tibetan local government) and is seventy-eight years old this year. He said: "Many officials of our Tibetan authorities at that time set off for India in August 1912 and held several meetings in Simla, Delhi, Urura and other places. The documents submitted at these meetings were not formally signed by the representatives of our central government at that time. This McMahon Line was never mentioned at the meeting at all. It was secretly decided by British imperialism and individual Tibetan officials. At that time, even the vast majority of officials of the local government did not know about it."

Jiacuo Lin Living Buddha, Deputy Director of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, Gasheba, who once served as the Kālons of the former Tibetan local government, and Jiangjin Suolang Jiebu, a personage from Tibetan cultural circles, also spoke at the meeting. They all unanimously supported the position and measures taken by our government on the Sino-Indian border issue.

Lhasa People of All Ethnic Groups Unanimously Support the Government's Solemn Position

Many people use their personal experience to prove that the so-called McMahon Line is illegal and severely criticize the anti-China wave set off by some people in India.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 14th: People of all ethnic groups in Lhasa resolutely support the solemn position taken by our government on the Sino-Indian border issue. They believe that the position, attitude and policy adopted by our government fully express the strong will of our people, especially the Tibetan people, to defend the territorial integrity of the motherland and maintain Sino-Indian friendship. Many people used their personal experience to prove that the so-called McMahon Line is illegal, and severely criticized the new anti-China wave set off by some people in India.

Gongbi, who once served as the "Gujia" (close attendant) of the 13th Dalai Lama, and Dr. Kerao Luobu, who participated in the Simla Conference as a representative of the Tibetan local authorities, pointed out that the so-called McMahon Line is illegal. Seventy-eight-year-old Kerao Luobu said: The Simla Conference was an important step in Britain's conspiracy to separate Tibet from China. The issue discussed throughout the conference was the boundary between Inner and Outer Tibet and Tibet and other parts of China. He said: "During the meeting and after returning to Tibet, I never heard of the exchange of notes regarding the 'McMahon Line.' It was only more than ten years after returning to Tibet that the British raised this issue, which caused dissatisfaction among officials and the masses of the Kashag (the former Tibetan local government)." Gongbi said that between 1929 and 1935 after the Simla Conference, the British, on the pretext that our territory of Mendawang, Luoyu and Chayu and other regions were south of the so-called McMahon Line, sent people there three times to carry out ulterior motives. Before and after the Second World War, the British army began to occupy a few places in these areas, which was strongly resisted by the local people at that time. Gongbi said: "Now the Indian government is actually demanding that the Chinese government recognize the McMahon Line illegally imposed on our country by Britain, which is completely unreasonable."

Jiacuo Lin Living Buddha, President of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, and Dingjie Living Buddha, Deputy Director of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said that our country has never recognized the humiliating "McMahon Line" and will never be able to recognize this line. Dingjie Living Buddha said that after the peaceful liberation of Tibet, we Tibetan people urgently demanded a solution to the border issue. The central government, considering its relationship with India, always wanted to resolve it through diplomatic channels. Now, the Indian government is attempting to take advantage of the fact that some imperialist agents in India are launching large-scale attacks on our country and creating a tense situation to force our country to accept its one-sided claims on the Sino-Indian border issue. This will never be realized. Jiacuo Lin and Dingjie Living Buddhas hope that the Indian government will adopt a wise attitude and stop its activities of encroaching on Chinese territory in order to ease the tension on the Sino-Indian border.

When the residents of Lhasa heard that the Indian government was attempting to use the so-called McMahon Line as the boundary between India and the local government of Tibet in China, they were extremely indignant. Cairen Nuobu, a resident of Dongqu who is familiar with the border situation, said that the Mendawang, Luoyu and other regions have been part of Tibet since ancient times. Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, many of us often went there.

In 1952, when I went to Tawang to visit relatives, the Indians who invaded there forced me to get their road permit before letting me pass, and they also set up radio stations and stationed troops there, and forced the local people to build barracks and roads, and enslaved the people there. Now, Prime Minister Nehru has proposed the McMahon Line, trying to permanently occupy the Chinese territory they occupied by force, which is unacceptable to the people of our country, and we Tibetan people must first oppose it.

Ranba Tudan Gunqing, the retired Chief Kālons of the former Tibetan local government, said:

In 1947, the Indian government sent a note to the Kashag, requesting that the area south of the so-called McMahon Line be划归划归(劃歸) under India. At that time, the Kashag sent a telegram to Prime Minister Nehru, resolutely rejecting this one-sided request.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 14th: Ranba Tudan Gunqing, the retired Chief Kālons of the former Tibetan local government, told reporters today that the so-called McMahon Line is an illegal boundary line, which has not only never been recognized by the central government, but also has not been recognized by the Tibetan local government.

The old man, who has served as the Kālons of the Tibetan local government since 1943, said: The Tibetan local government has never recognized the so-called McMahon Line and has always exercised power over the area south of this line. For example, the "Men" area centered on Tawang (Tawang), south of the so-called McMahon Line, the local residents were still paying taxes to the Tibetan local government in 1951.

He said: "The Simla Conference was one of the major conspiracies of British imperialism to instigate Tibet to separate from China. The Chinese central government has never approved the treaties proposed at the conference. Although the representatives of Britain and the Tibetan local authorities signed the agreement, they only did things that were not appropriate for their status as representatives of a region of China."

He said: "The Simla Conference discussed the issue of the boundary between the so-called Inner and Outer Tibet. The so-called McMahon Line was decided by the British representative and the Tibetan local representative in the form of secret exchange of notes outside the meeting. Not only was it not discussed and approved by the Tibetan local government, but the Tibetan local representative also kept it secret for a long time." Ranba said: Even after the secret exchange of notes between the British representative and the Tibetan local representative, the Tibetan local government still exercised power in those areas.

Ranba Tudan Gunqing said: In the fourth year of my tenure as Kālons, that is, in 1947, the Indian government sent a note to the Kashag, saying that India was independent and requested to inherit Britain's "rights" and划归划归(劃歸) the area south of the so-called McMahon Line under India. At that time, it aroused great indignation among the officials, and the Kashag (Tibetan local government) sent a telegram to Prime Minister Nehru, resolutely rejecting this one-sided request and demanding that India return the territory south of this line. Ranba Tudan Gunqing said: Prime Minister Nehru should clearly remember this.

Yixi Chilie Geshi, who once served as an administrative official in Mendawang, said:

In the vast "Mendawang" area south of the western end of the so-called McMahon Line, the Tibetan local government was still exercising sovereignty there just a few years ago. On the morning of February 7, 1951, the Indian armed forces invaded Tawang. But even after the Indian army forcibly occupied the area, the local residents still paid taxes to the Tibetan local government.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 14th: Yixi Chilie Geshi, a lama from Sera Monastery (one of the three major monasteries in Lhasa) who was still serving as the acting "Laye" (administrative official of the Tibetan local government in charge of the entire "Men" area) in Tawang (place name, that is, Tawang, the center of the "Men" area south of the so-called McMahon Line) in 1948, told reporters today that the large area of land south of the so-called McMahon Line that was forcibly occupied by India has always been Chinese territory. The Indian government's attempt to force our country to accept the aggressive McMahon Line of British imperialism is something that the people of our country will never agree to.

Yixi Chilie Geshi said: The fact is not as Nehru said, "China划归划归(劃歸) a large piece of other people's land as its own territory," but India划归划归(劃歸) a large piece of our country's land as their territory and forcibly occupied it with force. He pointed out that in the vast "Mendawang" area south of the western end of the so-called McMahon Line, the local government of Tibet in China was still exercising sovereignty there just a few years ago.

He said: The "Men" area centered on Tawang has always been under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan local government. This area was given by the Tibetan local government to one of its four Zhongyi Qingbo (Grand Secretaries) as a "salary" land. Before 1948, it was owned by Zhongyi Qingbo Angwang Langjie, and my relatives Luosang Quzha and Wujian Quwang were appointed as "Laye". In 1948, I served as their agent in Tawang for seven months, managing all affairs in the Men area. After 1949, Zizhong Tudeng Qubi served as "Laye" there.

Yixi Chilie said: On the morning of the first day of the Tibetan calendar Iron Rabbit year (February 7, 1951 AD), the Indian armed forces invaded Tawang. The administrative officials of the Tibetan local government in the area left the area under duress, but in the first two years after the area was forcibly occupied by the Indian army, the local residents still paid taxes to the Tibetan local government.

Yixi Chilie is from Cuona County (formerly Cuona Zong) near Tawang. He said that he lived in Cuona and Tawang for thirteen years. The local residents have always lived in Cuona in the summer and lived in Tawang in the winter to avoid the severe cold of Cuona in winter. Yixi Chilie said: Whether it is the local historical administrative and economic relations, people's lives, or records in historical books and classics, it is undeniable that the place belongs to China's territory.

Yixi Chilie said: The "Men" area was originally a scattered tribe, and it was unified during the fifth Dalai Lama, and one monk and one lay official were sent to jointly manage it with the local executive officials. From then on, the area was directly under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan local government, and the local residents had to pay taxes to the "Laye" appointed by the Tibetan local government every summer and autumn.

The Sera Monastery lama said that the name Tawang was originally called "Yumen Zhegang" because its terrain is large at the bottom and small at the top, and its shape is like the "Menzhe" used by lamas when chanting scriptures. The name Tawang was derived from the fact that Dazun god of Sera Monastery preached there, indicating that Dazun god had preached there (in Tibetan, "Wang" means preaching).

Yixi Chilie Geshi said that even the Khenpo (chief) of the temple in the "Men" area has always been appointed by the Luoselin Zhacang of Drepung Monastery (one of the three major monasteries in Lhasa), and it was only forced to stop sending it after India illegally occupied Tawang in 1951.

Yixi Chilie Geshi told reporters that he is one of the tens of millions of people who have been directly harmed by India's occupation of our country's territory of Mendawang. Because India forcibly occupied the area, his family was unable to reunite. Until now, one of his older sisters and several younger sisters are still living in Tawang.

Yixi Chilie Geshi was very indignant that India, which forcibly occupied a large area of our country's territory, falsely accused our country of carrying out aggression. He said that the Indian army not only occupies a large area of our country's territory south of the so-called McMahon Line, but also crossed the so-called McMahon Line and occupied our country's territory north of the line in several places, which is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country. He demanded that India immediately stop its occupation of our country's territory.

Basuo Living Buddha, who was preaching there when the Indian army occupied Tawang, said:

Three months after I arrived in Tawang, three Indians with radio stations, leading seventy Indian soldiers, suddenly occupied Tawang. These Indians also forced Zongben and other administrative personnel to leave within a limited time. I was forced to leave Tawang. At that time, the Indians also detained all my property.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 14th: Basuo Living Buddha of Gandan Monastery, who was preaching there when the Indian army occupied Tawang eight years ago, severely condemned India's despicable act of encroaching on our country's territory. He said: "India's responsibility for encroaching on our country's territory is undeniable. I personally experienced and witnessed the Indian army's encroachment on Menmendawang."

When the Indian army occupied Tawang, an important center in the Menmendawang area of Tibet, on February 7, 1951, Basuo Living Buddha was preaching there. He arrived there three months ago at the request of the monks and people of Tawang. The Living Buddha said: "Menmendawang has always been Chinese territory and is under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan local government. Gandan Monastery also sends Khenpos and lamas to preach there." He said that this was why he was able to go there to preach to his followers.

Basuo Tudeng Queji Living Buddha said: "Three months after I arrived in Tawang, that is, on February 7, 1951, three Indians with radio stations, leading seventy Indian soldiers, suddenly occupied Tawang. These Indian troops crossed the border from Abadala and Balibala Mountain in the southern part of the Menmendawang area and invaded our country." He said: "At that time, the Cuona Zong (equivalent to a county) government of the Tibetan local government was in Tawang, and Zongben (county magistrate) Luosang Sanjie also lived there. The Indians forced Zongben to convene all the Zuogan (headmen) of the Menmendawang area to a meeting at the Indian barracks. An Indian who called himself the Indian "representative" announced that they had been instructed by the Indian government to come to Menmendawang. From now on, the Menmendawang area, up to the area south of the Bangla and Longla Mountains (now southern Cuona) in the north, belongs to India and is administered by people sent by the Indian government. This Indian "representative" also forced Zongben and other administrative personnel of the Tibetan local government of our country to leave completely within a limited time. This Indian also announced that the people of Menmendawang would no longer be allowed to pay grain and taxes to the Tibetan local government, and all taxes would be managed by the Indians."

Basuo Living Buddha said: "At that time, the people of the Menmendawang area were all extremely indignant at the Indian army's invasion. The masses in many villages held meetings to protest the Indian army's aggression and demanded that the Indians withdraw from Menmendawang. The Indian army suppressed the local people's resistance. Because the Tawang Laye (manager) fled back to Lhasa to report the Indian army's invasion to the Tibetan local government, the Indian soldiers also arrested Laye's attendant Xiji and detained him in the barracks and tortured him severely."

Basuo Living Buddha said that the Indians who invaded Tawang interrogated him several times, forcing him to leave Tawang immediately. Therefore, he was forced to leave before he finished preaching. He said: "When I left, the Indians also detained more than forty bags of rice that the local people donated to Gandan Monastery and all my own property."

Basuo Living Buddha said, "The ironclad fact of the Indian army's invasion of our country is like this. The Indian government's attempt to force us to accept the illegal McMahon Line as the boundary line between China and India and permanently occupy our country's Menmendawang and other territories is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country." He warned the reactionary elements in India who are creating an anti-China movement: "Keep your heads clear. The Tibetan people are no longer the people of 1904 when British imperialism invaded Tibet. In the big family of the motherland, they have forever freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism and will no longer be arbitrarily manipulated by any foreigners.

    西藏自治区筹备委员会讨论中印边界问题
    西藏人民坚决保卫祖国领土
    拉萨熟悉情况人士用具体事实揭露印度侵占我国领土真相
    新华社拉萨14日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会12日下午举行会议讨论中印边界问题。参加会议的筹委会在拉萨委员、所属各部门负责人和拉萨各界人士，一致表示坚决拥护我国政府对中印边界问题的严正立场，并且对印度侵占我国领土表示愤怒抗议。
    到会的人员一致表示：中国人民首先是西藏人民决不承认所谓“麦克马洪线”。西藏人民保卫祖国领土完整的决心是坚定不移的。许多人还举出事实，揭露印度政府侵占我国领土的真相。
    自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美在会上说：我们西藏人民都十分清楚这条所谓麦克马洪线是英帝国主义的侵略线，西藏人民反对它，全国人民反对它。他说：西藏解放以后，虽然我国政府不承认所谓麦克马洪线，但由于坚持友谊睦邻的政策，我国军队从来没有越过麦克马洪线，而印度军队却步步侵入我国领土。究竟谁是侵略者，事实是很清楚的。他还说：我们爱好和平，十分珍惜中印友谊，但也决不容许别人侵略我国的领土。西藏人民一定要与全国人民一道，为维护祖国领土主权的完整而斗争。
    自治区筹委会常务委员桑颇·才旺仁增揭露了印度政府侵占我国领土的事实。桑颇·才旺仁增是原西藏地方政府噶伦之一，他说：“至今被印度侵占的‘门’地区（包括塔湾）一直是我国的领土。在‘门’地区还有西藏地方政府分给我的领地和庄园，直到1951年为止，这些领地上的百姓还向我支付差税，归我管辖。‘门’地方的行政官员也一直是由西藏地方当局委派，只有在印军入侵以后，印度政府才硬说这一地区是印度的。”
    曾经担任过原西藏地方政府司伦（地位在噶厦政府之上，仅低于达赖喇嘛）的常务委员朗顿·滚噶旺秋说，西藏地方当局当时虽有个别反动官员参加了西姆拉会议，但这些官员回到西藏后却从来不敢把会议的真相公开，他们不仅不让地方政府的官员看到这个会议的文件，甚至对我这个司伦都保密。这说明这个会议是不能见人的，也是非法的。曾经作为西藏地方政府代表的随从人员之一参加过西姆拉会议的原西藏地方政府官员拉曼·青仁洛布，也在会上揭露了西姆拉会议的真相。拉曼·青仁洛布是门孜康（原西藏地方政府的医算局）的负责人，今年已经七十八岁。他说：“当时我们西藏当局的许多官员，是1912年8月动身去印度的，先后在西姆拉、德里、乌鲁拉等地开过几次会议。这些会议上所提出的文件，当时我国中央政府的代表都没有正式签字。这一麦克马洪线，当时根本没有在会议上提出过，而是英帝国主义与西藏个别官员秘密决定，当时连地方政府的绝大多数官员都不知道。”
    在这次会上讲话的还有自治区筹备委员会宗教事务委员会副主任委员嘉措林活佛，曾经担任过原西藏地方政府噶伦的噶雪巴、西藏文化界人士江金·索郎杰布。他们都一致拥护我国政府对中印边界问题所持的立场和采取的措施。
    拉萨各族人民一致拥护政府严正立场
    许多人用亲身经历证明所谓麦克马洪线是非法的，并且严厉斥责印度一些人所掀起的反华浪潮。
    新华社拉萨14日电　拉萨市各族人民坚决拥护我国政府对中印边界问题所采取的严正立场。他们认为，我国政府所采取的这种立场、态度和方针，完全表达了我国人民特别是西藏人民保卫祖国领土完整的坚强意志和维护中印友好的愿望。许多人用亲身经历证明所谓麦克马洪线是非法的，并且严厉斥责印度一些人所掀起的新的反华浪潮。
    曾任十三世达赖喇嘛“古加”（近侍）的龚比，和参加西姆拉会议的西藏地方当局代表的医生克绕罗布一致指出：所谓麦克马洪线是不合法的。七十八岁的克绕罗布说：西姆拉会议是英国阴谋把西藏从中国分割出去的一个重要步骤，这次会议自始至终所讨论的是内外藏和西藏同中国其他部分的界线问题。他说：“在开会期间和回到西藏以后，我就没有听说过有关‘麦克马洪线’的换文，回到西藏十来年后，英国才提出这个问题，当时就曾引起噶厦（原西藏地方政府）官员和群众的不满。”龚比说，在西姆拉会议以后的1929到1935年间，英国人借口我国领土门达旺、珞瑜和察隅等地区是所谓麦克马洪线以南地区，曾三次派人到那里去进行不可告人的阴谋活动。在第二次世界大战前后，英国军队开始侵占了这些地区的少数地点，当时曾遭到当地人民的强烈反抗。龚比说：“现在印度政府竟然要求中国政府承认英国非法强加于我国的麦克马洪线，这是完全没有理由的。”
    中国佛教协会西藏分会会长嘉措林活佛、西藏自治区筹备委员会宗教事务委员会副主任丁杰活佛说，我国从来没有承认辱国丧权的“麦克马洪线”，而且永远也不能承认这条线。丁杰活佛说，西藏和平解放后，我们西藏人民就迫切要求解决边界问题，中央考虑到和印度的关系，总想通过外交途径来解决。现在印度政府却企图借印度国内的一些帝国主义代理人向我国大肆攻击、制造紧张局势的时候，强使我国接受它对中印边界问题的片面主张。这是永远不会实现的。嘉措林和丁杰两位活佛希望印度政府采取明智态度，停止侵占中国领土的活动，以缓和中印边境的紧张局势。
    拉萨市居民在听到印度政府企图把所谓麦克马洪线作为印度和中国西藏地方的边界时，极为愤慨。熟悉边境情况的东区居民才仁诺布说，门达旺、珞瑜等地区从古以来就是西藏的地方，西藏和平解放前，我们许多人还常常到那里去。
    1952年当我去达旺探亲时，侵入那里的印度人强迫我拿他们路条才让通行，而且在那里设电台驻军队，还强迫当地老百姓修营房、修公路，对那里的人民进行奴役。现在尼赫鲁总理竟提出什么麦克马洪线，想把他们用武力侵占去的中国领土永远占据下去，这是我国人民所不能接受的，我们藏族人民首先要反对。
    原西藏地方政府卸任首席噶伦然巴·图丹滚清说：
    1947年，印度政府曾给噶厦照会，要求把所谓麦克马洪线以南的地方划归印度。当时，噶厦曾致电尼赫鲁总理，坚决拒绝这一片面要求。
    新华社拉萨14日电　原西藏地方政府卸任首席噶伦然巴·图丹滚清今天向本社记者说：所谓麦克马洪线是一条非法界线，它不但从来没有被中央政府承认过，而且西藏地方政府也没有承认过。
    这位从1943年就开始担任西藏地方政府噶伦的老人说：西藏地方政府一直没有承认所谓麦克马洪线，而且一直对这条线以南的地区行使政权，例如所谓麦克马洪线以南的以达旺（塔湾）为中心的“门”地区，当地居民在1951年还向西藏地方政府纳税支差。
    他说：“西姆拉会议是英帝国主义企图嗾使西藏从中国分离出去的重大阴谋之一，中国中央政府一直没有批准会议上所提出的条约。英国和西藏地方当局代表虽然签了字，那也只是作为中国一个地区代表，做了不合身分的事情。”
    他说：“西姆拉会议讨论的是所谓内藏和外藏的界线问题，所谓麦克马洪线是英国代表和西藏地方代表在会外以秘密换文的方式决定的，不但未经西藏地方政府讨论通过，西藏地方代表也在很长时间内一直隐瞒着这件事。”然巴说：就是在英国代表和西藏地方代表秘密换文以后，西藏地方政府仍然在那些地区行使政权。
    然巴·图丹滚清说：我担任噶伦的第四年，也就是1947年，印度政府曾给噶厦照会，说印度独立了，要求继承英国的“权利”，把所谓麦克马洪线以南的地方划归印度。当时引起官员们的极大愤慨，噶厦（西藏地方政府）曾致电尼赫鲁总理，坚决拒绝这一片面的要求，并要求印度归还这条线以南的领土。然巴·图丹滚清说：尼赫鲁总理应该是清楚地记得这一点的。
    曾在门达旺担任行政官员的益西赤烈格西说：
    在所谓麦克马洪线西端以南广大的“门达旺”地区，就在几年前，还是西藏地方政府在那里行使主权。1951年2月7日清晨，印度武装部队侵占了达旺。但就在印军强占后，当地居民仍然向西藏地方政府支差纳税。
    新华社拉萨14日电　1948年还在达旺（地名，即塔湾，是所谓麦克马洪线以南“门”地区的中心）担任代理“拉业”（西藏地方政府管理整个“门”地区的行政官员）的色拉寺（拉萨三大寺之一）喇嘛益西赤烈格西（格西是喇嘛教的最高学位），今天对记者说：被印度强占去的所谓麦克马洪线以南的大片土地，历来都是中国的领土。印度政府企图强使我国接受英帝国主义的侵略性的麦克马洪线，这是我国人民永远不能同意的。
    益西赤烈格西说：事实并不是像尼赫鲁所说的那样，“中国把别人的大块土地划作自己的领土”，倒是印度把我国的大片土地划成了他们的领土，而且用武力加以强占。他指出：在所谓麦克马洪线西端以南的广大的“门达旺”地区，就在几年前，还是中国西藏地方政府在那里行使主权。
    他说：以达旺为中心的“门”地区，历来就是西藏地方政府管辖的。这块地方是西藏地方政府给它的四个仲译清波（大秘书）中的一个作为“薪俸”地的。1948年以前，是仲译清波昂旺郎杰领有，我的亲戚洛桑曲扎和乌间曲旺被委派为“拉业”。1948年，我曾经代理他们在达旺任了七个月的“拉业”，管理门地区的一切事务。从1949年以后便是孜仲土登曲丕在那里担任“拉业”。
    益西赤烈说：藏历铁兔年元月1日（公元1951年2月7日）清晨，印度武装部队侵占了达旺，西藏地方政府在当地的行政官员在武力逼迫下离开了这个地区，但这个地区在被印军强占后的头两年，当地居民仍然向西藏地方政府支差纳税。
    益西赤烈是靠近达旺地方的错那县（原错那宗）人，他说，他在错那和达旺生活了十三年。当地居民历来是夏天在错那，冬季便住在达旺，以避错那冬季的严寒。益西赤烈说：无论是当地历来的行政、经济关系，人民生活或者是史籍经典的记载，都无可辩驳地说明那里是属于中国的领土。
    益西赤烈说：“门”地区早先是分散的部落，五世达赖时才统一起来，并派去了僧俗官员各一人，与地方的执政人员共同管理。从那以后，这个地区就直接为西藏地方政府管辖，当地居民每年夏秋两季都要向西藏地方政府委派的“拉业”支差。
    这位色拉寺喇嘛说：达旺这个地名很早以前本来叫做“玉门者岗”，因为它的地形下大上小，形状像喇嘛教念经敬神时用的“门者”。达旺的名称，是因为色拉寺的达尊神在那里讲经而得来的，表明达尊神在那里讲过经（藏语“旺”是讲经的意思）。
    益西赤烈格西说：连“门”地区寺庙的堪布（总管），历来都是由哲蚌寺（拉萨三大寺之一）洛色林扎仓委派的，一直到1951年印度非法侵占达旺后才被迫停止派遣。
    益西赤烈格西对记者说，他是印度侵占我国领土门达旺而直接受到损害的千万个人中的一个，由于印度强占了这个地区，使他一家人不得团聚，直到现在他的一个姐姐和几个妹妹仍在达旺居住。
    益西赤烈格西对印度强占着我国大片领土反而诬蔑我国进行侵略，十分愤慨。他说，印度军队不仅占领着所谓麦克马洪线以南的我国大片领土，而且还越过了所谓的麦克马洪线，在好几个地方侵占了这条线以北的我国领土，这是我国人民绝对不能容忍的。他要求印度立即停止对我国领土的侵占。
    印军侵占达旺时正在那里讲经的八索活佛说：
    我到达旺三个月后，带着电台的三个印度人，率领着七十个印度士兵，突然占领了达旺。这些印度人还强迫宗本和其他行政人员限期离开。我就是被强迫离开达旺的。当时印度人还扣留了我的全部财物。
    新华社拉萨14日电　八年前印度军队侵占达旺时正在那里讲经的噶丹寺八索活佛，严厉斥责印度侵占我国领土的卑鄙行为。他说：“印度侵占我国领土的责任是无容抵赖的，我曾亲身经历和目睹印军侵占门达旺的情形。”
    1951年2月7日印度军队侵占西藏门达旺地区的重要中心达旺时，八索活佛正在那里讲经。他是应达旺僧俗人民的请求，于三个月前到达那里的。这位活佛说：“门达旺历来就是中国的领土，由西藏地方政府管辖。噶丹寺也派有堪布、大喇嘛驻在那里讲经。”他说，正是因为这样，他才能到那里去给他的信徒讲经。
    八索·土登却吉活佛说：“我到达旺的三个月后，也就是1951年2月7日带着电台的三个印度人，率领着七十个印度士兵，突然占领了达旺。这些印度军队是从门达旺地区南部阿巴达拉和巴里巴拉山越过国境侵入我国的。”他说：“当时西藏地方政府的错那宗（相当于县）政府就在达旺，宗本（县长）洛桑三结也住在那里。印度人强迫宗本召集门达旺地区的全体作干（头人）到印度兵营地开会，一个自称为印度“代表”的印度人，宣布他们奉印度政府的指示来门达旺，今后门达旺地区直到北部的邦拉、隆拉山（现在错那南部）以南的地方，都属于印度，由印度政府派人进行管辖。这个印度“代表”并强迫宗本和我国西藏地方政府的其他行政人员在限定的日期内全部离开。这个印度人还宣布不准门达旺的老百姓再给西藏地方政府纳粮上税，差税全部由印度人经管。”
    八索活佛说：“当时门达旺地区的人民对印军的入侵无不表示极端愤慨，很多村庄的群众集会抗议印度军队的侵犯行为，要求印度人撤出门达旺。印军对当地群众的反抗进行了镇压。由于达旺拉业（管理人）逃回拉萨向西藏地方政府报告印军入侵情况，印兵还逮捕了拉业的随员西吉，关在兵营里严刑拷打。”
    八索活佛说，侵入达旺的印度人曾几次把他叫去审问，强迫他立即离开达旺。因此，他还没有讲完经，就被迫离开了那里。他说：“在我离开时，印度人还扣留了当地群众给噶丹寺布施的四十多包大米和我自己的全部财物。”
    八索活佛说，“印度军队侵占我国的铁一般的事实，就是这样。印度政府企图强使我们接受非法的麦克马洪线为中印两国的边界线，永远霸占我国的门达旺和其他领土，我国人民绝对不能容忍。”他警告印度国内那些制造反华运动的反动分子：“把头脑放清醒一点。西藏人民再不是1904年英帝国主义侵略西藏时的人民了。他们在祖国大家庭里，已经永远摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊，再不受任何外国人的随意摆布了。
