Some newspapers have also published commentaries, praising the achievements of China's socialist construction.

    The "People's Unity" newspaper published the full text of the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on August 27th on its front page under the title "Go All Out, Aim High, and Achieve Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results in Construction." The "Voice of Free People" newspaper published a news report entitled "Beijing People Warmly Welcome the Communiqué of the Chinese Communist Party," reporting on the widespread jubilation of the Chinese people after the publication of the Communiqué.

    The "National News" newspaper published news on its front page on the 29th about the Chinese people's warm and enthusiastic support for the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

The newspaper also published a commentary pointing out that the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party in the overall aspects of industrial and agricultural production and socialist construction are very gratifying for all countries fighting for freedom and independence. Regarding the errors and shortcomings mentioned in the Communiqué, the commentary stated that "those who have just participated in socialist practice will make mistakes. However, if the proportion of errors is one-tenth, it is understandable, because this is success." The commentary added, "If we see that China's land is vast and its population is large, we will understand that these achievements are extraordinary."

The commentary said that what is happening in China also proves that socialism can shorten the time it takes for a country to transform from backwardness and corruption to freedom, happiness, and prosperity. This will become a source of inspiration for humanity, especially for the people in its neighboring regions.
