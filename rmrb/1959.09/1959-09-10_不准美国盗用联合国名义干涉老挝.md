    The U.S. Must Not Steal the UN's Name to Interfere in Laos
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    The United States is stealing the name of the United Nations and stepping up its planning of a new conspiracy to interfere in Laos, which cannot but arouse serious attention from all peace-loving people in the world. On September 4, under the instigation of the United States, the Lao Sananikone government fabricated facts, falsely accusing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of "aggression," and openly demanded that the United Nations send an "emergency force" to carry out international military intervention in Laos. The next day, the U.S. State Department issued a statement "firmly supporting" the Lao authorities' request. The third day, the U.S. representative proposed a motion in the United Nations Security Council to send a so-called "investigation committee" to Laos, and on September 8, the Security Council, under the manipulation of the United States, disregarding the resolute opposition of the Soviet representative and violating the UN Charter, illegally announced the adoption of the U.S. proposal. At the same time, the Lao authorities also requested "assistance" from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization; the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have also been notified to meet to discuss the Lao authorities' request for "assistance." All this shows that the United States is painstakingly attempting to further expand the civil war in Laos and drag the situation in Laos onto a more complicated and dangerous road.
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on September 5, denouncing this new conspiratorial step by U.S. imperialism to exacerbate the tense situation in Laos. On September 6, Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, telegraphed Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, reminding them again of the extremely serious situation in Laos and requesting them to take measures to stop the U.S. interference in Laos and the Lao civil war. On the same day, Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong also telegraphed the heads of the United Nations, clarifying the truth about the situation in Laos, refuting the shameless slanders made by the United States and the Lao Sananikone clique against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and pointing out, completely reasonably, that for the sake of peace and security in Southeast Asia and the world, the United Nations must reject the slanderous arguments of the Phoui Sananikone government and reject its unreasonable demands. The Chinese people firmly support the just stand taken by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Lao issue to uphold the Geneva Accords and safeguard peace in the Far East.
    As everyone knows, the situation of civil war in Laos has been created single-handedly by U.S. imperialism in recent months. Nearly four months ago, the Sananikone clique, under the instigation of the United States, tore up the Geneva Accords and provoked the civil war in Laos; then, with the active support of the United States, it adopted a series of reactionary measures to expand the civil war, launching bloody persecution movements such as "military sweeps" in various parts of Laos. The former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and the patriotic people in many areas of Laos could no longer tolerate it, rose up to defend themselves, opposing the Sananikone government's disastrous policies that harmed the country and the people, abandoned the Geneva Accords, and betrayed the national interests of Laos; demanding that the Phoui Sananikone government implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, release the arrested leaders of the Patriotic Front, and restore domestic democracy and freedom. This is the undeniable truth of the situation in Laos. But now the United States and the Lao Sananikone government are falsely accusing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of so-called "aggression," claiming that "if" there were no participation and "support" from the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Lao people's self-defense armed forces could never defeat the Sananikone army equipped with U.S. weapons. This is a complete fabrication. The Lao Sananikone government has been pursuing a reactionary policy of undermining the Geneva Accords under the direction of U.S. imperialism, and has been opposed by the broad masses of the Lao people. Recently, Lao Foreign Minister Phagna, at a press conference, also admitted the problem of "popular support for the Pathet Lao movement." Sananikone himself has also issued intimidating statements in succession due to the Lao people's participation in the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units. These statements admit that "a large number of people are participating" in the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units; and "former Pathet Lao Fighting Unit personnel who have been demobilized" have also participated in self-defense battles. Even the Paris "Le Figaro" correspondent in Vientiane believes in his dispatches that the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly are already "bad" because the people's self-defense armed forces "will undoubtedly receive all the necessary assistance they need from the residents." The fact is very clear that what exists in Laos at present is a domestic war, and it does not involve the so-called "aggression" by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at all. Not long ago, British Chief of the General Staff Festing also admitted that there was no reliable evidence of so-called "North Vietnamese intervention." A "Washington Post" reporter also said in a report on September 2: High-ranking officials of the British and French governments "unanimously believe that there is currently no evidence to prove that the Communists are intervening from outside Laos."
    In fact, the sudden accusation by the United States and the Lao Sananikone government to the United Nations about the "aggression" by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at this time precisely exposes the U.S. attempt to fly the flag of the United Nations to realize its conspiracy to carry out direct military intervention in Laos. A dispatch from Washington by the United Press International on September 5 revealed several steps of this U.S. conspiracy. The dispatch said that the first step is "the United States will strongly urge the United Nations to quickly send a delegation" to Laos to conduct an "investigation"; the second step is to try to get the United Nations General Assembly to pass a resolution to send an "emergency force"; the third step is that "member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will be able to send troops under the protection of the authority of the United Nations," and the United States will "have the direct right" to carry out "military intervention" in Laos. Recently, the U.S. State Department openly announced that it would step up the transportation of armed equipment to Laos, and U.S. military personnel have also been entering the country one after another, strengthening control and intervention in Laos. While the United States and the Sananikone clique are playing with the conspiracy of UN intervention, the heads of the U.S. Navy and Air Force are issuing a series of war cries. U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Felt shouted: "All the forces of the (U.S.) Pacific Command are closely watching the situation (in Laos)." If necessary, the U.S. Pacific Fleet can intervene in any region of the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia at any time. U.S. Tactical Air Command Commander Everest also stated that the troops of his Tactical Air Command "can enter the Lao region within at most thirty-five hours after the government makes a decision." In addition, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is also carrying out intense war preparations in accordance with the instructions of the U.S. master. From this, it is not difficult for people to understand that the Lao Sananikone government's accusation to the United Nations about the "aggression" issue is entirely a farce directed by the United States; the purpose is to deliberately confuse the public and create an artificial tense situation, so as to facilitate the open military intervention of the U.S. aggressive forces and turn Laos into a military base for the United States to further invade Indochina and Southeast Asian countries and threaten peace in the Far East.
    It is very clear that in order to ease the current dangerous situation in Laos and maintain peace in Indochina, the fundamental problem lies in the Kingdom of Laos government implementing the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and in the United States immediately withdrawing all its military personnel in Laos and removing its military bases in Laos. The Geneva Accords are the foundation of peace in Indochina. In order to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords, the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos should immediately resume its activities and continue to assume its responsibilities to maintain peace in Laos. The United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Lao situation.

    不准美国盗用联合国名义干涉老挝
    本报评论员
    美国正在盗用联合国的名义，加紧策划一个干涉老挝的新阴谋，这不能不引起全世界一切爱好和平人民的严重注意。9月4日，老挝萨纳尼空政府在美国唆使下捏造事实，诬蔑越南民主共和国“侵略”，公然要求联合国派出一支“紧急部队”，对老挝实行国际军事干涉。第二天，美国国务院就发表声明“坚决支持”老挝当局的要求。第三天，美国代表即在联合国安全理事会上提出派遣一个所谓“调查委员会”到老挝去的动议，而9月8日安理会竟在美国的操纵下，不顾苏联代表的坚决反对，破坏联合国宪章，非法地宣布通过美国的这项提案。与此同时，老挝当局还向东南亚条约组织要求“援助”；东南亚条约组织的成员国也已被通知开会，讨论老挝当局乞求“援助”的问题。这一切表明了美国处心积虑地企图进一步扩大老挝内战，并把老挝局势拖向更加复杂化的危险道路。
    对于美帝国主义的这一加剧老挝紧张局势的新的阴谋步骤，越南民主共和国外交部已于9月5日发表声明予以痛斥。越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在9月6日致电1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德，再次提醒两位主席注意老挝当前极端严重的局势，要求两位主席采取措施，制止美国对老挝的干涉和制止老挝的内战。范文同外长还在同一天致电联合国负责人阐明了老挝局势的真相，据理驳斥了美国和老挝萨纳尼空集团对越南民主共和国的无耻诬蔑，并且完全合理地指出，为了东南亚和全世界的和平和安全，联合国必须驳斥培·萨纳尼空政府的诬蔑论调，拒绝它的无理要求。中国人民坚决支持越南民主共和国在老挝问题上所采取的维护日内瓦协议和保障远东和平的严正立场。
    人所共知，老挝内战的局面是近几个月来美帝国主义所一手制造出来的。将近四个月以前，萨纳尼空集团在美国教唆下撕毁日内瓦协议，挑起了老挝内战；之后又在美国的积极支持下，采取了一系列扩大内战的反动措施，在老挝各地发动了“军事扫荡”等血腥迫害运动。前寮国战斗部队和老挝许多地区的爱国人民忍无可忍，奋起进行自卫，反对萨纳尼空政府祸国殃民、废弃日内瓦协议和背叛老挝民族利益的卖国政策；要求培·萨纳尼空政府执行日内瓦协议和万象协议，释放被捕的爱国战线党领袖，恢复国内的民主和自由。这就是老挝局势的不容歪曲的真相。而现在美国和老挝萨纳尼空政府竟贼喊捉贼地诬蔑越南民主共和国的所谓“侵略”，它们造谣说，“如果”没有越南民主共和国的武装部队的参加和“支援”，老挝人民的自卫武装力量决不可能打败由美国武器装备起来的萨纳尼空的军队。这是彻头彻尾的虚构。老挝萨纳尼空政府由于奉行美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议的反动政策，而遭到广大老挝人民的反对，最近老挝外交大臣班雅在记者招待会上也承认了“民众支持寮国运动”的问题。萨纳尼空本人还由于老挝人民的纷纷参加前寮国战斗部队而连续发表恫吓性的声明。这些声明承认了“大批人民参加”前寮国战斗部队；而“已经复员的前寮国战斗部队人员”也参加了自卫战斗。甚至巴黎“费加罗报”驻万象记者在他的通讯里也认为，桑怒和丰沙里两省已经“坏了”，因为人民自卫武装力量“无疑地将从居民那里得到他们所需要的一切必要的援助”。事实很明显，目前老挝存在的是国内战争，而根本牵涉不到所谓越南民主共和国“侵略”的问题。不久前英国陆军总参谋长费斯丁也曾承认，所谓“北越干涉”是毫无可以信赖的证据的。9月2日“华盛顿邮报”记者在报道中也说：英法政府的高级官员“一致认为，目前没有证据证明，共产党人从老挝境外进行干涉”。
    事实上美国和老挝萨纳尼空政府在现在这个时候，突然向联合国提出关于越南民主共和国“侵略”的诬告，恰恰暴露了美国企图打着联合国的旗号，以实现它对老挝进行直接军事干涉的阴谋。9月5日合众国际社发自华盛顿的电讯就透露了美国这种阴谋的几个步骤。电讯说，第一步“美国将力促联合国迅速派遣一个代表团”到老挝进行“调查”；第二步企图使联合国大会通过派遣“紧急部队”的决议；第三步，“东南亚条约组织的成员国将能在联合国权力的庇护下派出部队”，美国也就“有直接的权利”对老挝实行“军事干涉”了。最近美国国务院公然宣布加紧运送武装装备到老挝去，美国军事人员也源源入境，加强了对老挝的控制和干涉。而在美国和萨纳尼空集团玩弄联合国干涉阴谋的同时，美国的海空军首脑们发出一片战争叫嚣。美国太平洋舰队司令费耳特叫嚷：“（美国）太平洋司令部的所有部队都在密切注视着（老挝）局势。”而如有必要的话，美国太平洋舰队随时都能够干预西太平洋和东南亚任何地区。美国战术空军司令部司令埃弗雷斯特也表示，他的战术空军司令部的军队“在政府作出决定后至多三十五小时内就能进入老挝地区”。此外，东南亚条约集团也正在按照美国主子的指令配合着进行紧张的备战活动。由此，人们不难理解，老挝萨纳尼空政府向联合国提出“侵略”问题的诬告行动，完全是美国导演的一出丑剧；目的就是要故弄玄虚，制造人为的紧张局势，以便于招来美国侵略势力的公开的军事干涉，把老挝变成美国进一步侵略印度支那和东南亚各国、威胁远东和平的军事基地。
    十分清楚，为了缓和当前老挝的危险局势、维护印度支那和平，根本问题在于老挝王国政府执行日内瓦协议和万象协议，在于美国立即撤出它在老挝的全部军事人员和撤除它在老挝的军事基地。日内瓦协议是印度支那和平的基础，为了保证日内瓦协议的实施，老挝国际监督和监察委员会应该立即恢复活动，继续担负起它的职责，以维护老挝的和平。联合国根本无权干涉老挝局势。
