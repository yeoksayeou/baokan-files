Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia Telegram The powerhouse of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project is officially under construction. Prior to this, the builders of the power station had already completed two months of deep pit backfilling work. Now, they are beginning to pour the bottom plate of the tailrace tunnel. Giant turbine generator sets will be installed on top of the tailrace tunnel bottom plate. The Sanmenxia Hydropower Station, designed by the Soviet Union, is a world-class giant power station, with a concrete pouring volume of more than 200,000 cubic meters. Its structure is complex and its technical requirements are very strict. The huge penstocks inside the power station dam are also being installed at an accelerated pace. These eight penstocks will be used to divert water to impact the turbine generator sets. (Attached picture)
