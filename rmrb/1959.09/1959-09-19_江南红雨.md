Ren Village, viewed from afar, resembles a verdant lotus leaf, lying quietly on the shores of Dianshan Lake in Qingpu. The summer breeze wafts, and the intoxicating fragrance of rice permeates the fields. Such robust rice paddies! The Ren Village production team has proposed a target of 1,000 catties per mu for rice yield. The people's commune's water windmills are scattered throughout the village, their sails turning, like white flowers blooming; water gurgles into the rice paddies. It hasn't rained for two months, but not a single piece of land in Ren Village is cracked.

In the evening, people return from the fields, and under the shade of the trees, the canteen's dinner is already laid out. The commune's wired broadcasting station is playing Shanghai opera that farmers love to hear; on the basketball court west of the village, dust flies, and the young men don't even bother to eat dinner before starting to play ball; children run around, laughing...

A Desolate Village

Coming to Ren Village for the first time, it's hard to imagine that this happy village, "ten thousand green willows in the spring breeze," was once a place where "ten thousand households were desolate and ghosts sang." Every middle-aged or older farmer in Ren Village who survived remembers clearly how desolate Ren Village was ten years ago! At that time: half of the village's 2,800 mu of rice fields were barren, and even the more than 1,000 mu that were cultivated, in the farmers' words, "couldn't be distinguished whether there were more barnyard grass or rice seedlings." Where had the people who cultivated the land gone?

More than fifty houses in the village had collapsed, and some of the houses that hadn't collapsed were empty and deserted, overgrown with weeds. Where were the owners of the houses?

Here, you couldn't hear the cries of infants or the laughter of children, and you couldn't even see a diaper hanging outside. Where was the new generation?

A cloud of sorrow and despair locked Ren Village—Ren Village was on its last breath, tormented by the plague god, how could there be any vitality? The plague god, the Kuomintang that exploited the people's blood and sweat like schistosomiasis, and the schistosomiasis that sucked the people's blood like the Kuomintang, caused countless families in Ren Village to be destroyed!

The white-haired neighbor sighs in sorrow, the children in the west house have lost their parents, the fields are barren and the houses are empty, and the whole village is filled with cries!

This lament contains countless tragedies! During the twenty years of Kuomintang rule, schistosomiasis was rampant, and large numbers of people in Ren Village died. In 1930, the village had 960 people, but by 1949, only 461 people remained. The experience of He Xiugen's family is an epitome of the tragic fate of the farmers in Ren Village before liberation.

To the south of the village lived He Xiugen, a poor farmer, and his family of seven. Starting in 1937, they successively contracted schistosomiasis. To hire a doctor, the consultation fee alone was calculated by the distance, costing more than a stone of rice, which ordinary farmers simply couldn't afford. Even if the patients went to the town dozens of miles away to see a doctor, the doctor would only drain the abdominal fluid as a perfunctory measure. In a few years, this family of seven was reduced to only He Xiugen and his eldest son, Songfa. At this time, they both had schistosomiasis. His family rented four mu of land from the landlord, of which 2.8 mu of the harvest went to the landlord. Because of the continuous deaths in the family, He Xiugen really couldn't pay the rent, and the "official hall" sent people to arrest He Xiugen. As soon as Xiugen heard that the "official hall" was coming to arrest him, he braved the cold autumn wind and fled out of the village in the middle of the night. Xiugen escaped the official hall, but still couldn't escape death. Distressed and impoverished, he died not long after.

Songfa was a stubborn person. This late-stage schistosomiasis patient with ascites had lost his ability to work, but he had to struggle to go to the fields. Bending over to cut grass for a little longer would make him dizzy and unable to stand up straight; when treading on the waterwheel, his abdomen would have throbbing pains, which made him sweat profusely.

"Songfa, take a break..." Seeing this situation, Songfa's cousin, Lingao, always couldn't help but feel sad and persuade him.

"Rest? What about the debt? What about food?" Songfa gritted his teeth, not even willing to say another word. "Owing the landlord rent and being bullied by the landlord," in order to earn more money to repay the debt, Songfa labored during the day with his sick body, and went to the pond to fish at night; before the money earned with blood and sweat was even in his hands, it no longer belonged to him. Rent, usury, conscription tax... what could be left for himself!

In 1948, on the twentieth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, there was a heavy storm. Early the next morning, Songfa went to block the ditch. When he returned home in the evening, he was so tired that he fell on the bed, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood. The locals knew that contracting "big belly disease" would cause "blood rushing." Lingao rushed to see him immediately upon hearing the news, and received several basins of fresh blood. Songfa fell into a coma, and then his pulse stopped. He Xiugen's family died out like this.

Now, when He Lingao talks about his uncle's family, he says with infinite emotion: "If only they could have survived until liberation, they would have been saved! Of the four branches of our He family, three branches died of schistosomiasis, leaving only our branch." From 1930 until the eve of liberation, families that died out like He Xiugen's were not just three or five in Ren Village, but a full eighty! And there were twenty-eight families where only one person was left alive.

"The Communist Party has come to save us!"

"If only they could have survived until liberation..." When Ren Village people commemorate the dead, they always say this sentence with regret. After liberation, the political plague god, the Kuomintang, was eliminated, and the natural plague god—schistosomiasis—was also nearing its end. In the summer of 1950, the leaders of the Health Department of the East China Military and Political Committee came to Ren Village. A responsible comrade said meaningfully: In the old society, schistosomiasis controlled people's destiny; in the new society, the people must control the destiny of schistosomiasis! Soon after the leaders left Ren Village, they sent more than a dozen medical personnel to carry out schistosomiasis prevention and treatment work. In the open space in the village, doctors explained the dangers of schistosomiasis to the farmers.

"Before liberation, people said, 'Barnyard grass doesn't grow well in rice fields, bad luck causes big belly disease,' and that the ancestral grave's feng shui is bad and cannot be cured!" Everyone discussed animatedly.

The doctor showed everyone the miracidia under the microscope, and superstitious ideas such as "feng shui" and "luck" were shaken; the schistosomiasis prevention and treatment team cast the sunlight of hope into people's hearts, which were like deep pools and ancient wells.

"The Communist Party has come to save our lives!" The farmers, with tears in their eyes, rushed forward to shake the doctor's hand.

The Communist Party has come to save lives! After examination, out of the 461 people in this village, as many as 449 people had schistosomiasis eggs, with an infection rate of over 97%! If it wasn't treated in time, how many lives would the plague god take again! From 1950 to 1952, more than 200 people were cured free of charge in three batches in Ren Village. In the following years, dozens of people were sent to the schistosomiasis prevention and treatment station for treatment every year. The yellow and thin faces decreased year by year, and the strong and sturdy bodies increased year by year.

The Story of Wu Haiquan

Among these people, there was a man named Wu Haiquan, who contracted schistosomiasis when he was a teenager. People described him this way: "His belly is like a (big) winter melon, his face is like a (yellow) pumpkin, his arms are like (thin) loofahs, and his head and neck are like (small) cucumbers." Wu Haiquan, who was twenty years old, looked like an eight or nine year old child. Haiquan's mother brought him a child bride, Chunjin, from a neighboring village. Haiquan and Chunjin also had a good relationship. Both were in their early twenties, and Chunjin looked at her fiancé, who looked like a child, was weak, and couldn't work. How could she live with him for a long time in the future? Thinking about her own future, Chunjin decided to leave Haiquan's house. One morning, Chunjin left with a small bundle. Haiquan's mother couldn't help crying. Would Haiquan really not live long? His father also died of this disease, would this child be like his father... Haiquan's mother didn't dare to think further, and cried more and more sadly.

However, times were different. The era of Haiquan's father tormented thousands upon thousands of Haiquan's fathers to death; the era of Haiquan could pull thousands upon thousands of Haiquan back from the brink of death! Although Haiquan's illness was so serious that it was almost impossible to treat, the government still tried everything possible to save him. People with this late-stage disease were at risk, and doctors and nurses took special care of him. If he felt even slightly uncomfortable, the medical staff would come to take care of him, and they also used some expensive medicines. From that time on, Haiquan, who was twenty-one years old, began to develop. The "small withered seedling" turned green again under the cultivation of the Party! In 1956, Haiquan's body gradually recovered, and the government sent Haiquan out for medical treatment again, completely curing his schistosomiasis. "It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved me from the coffin!" Haiquan always said this heartfelt sentence excitedly when talking to others about his past. "If there was no Communist Party, Haiquan's bones would have rotted away by now!" The villagers also said this.

Now, Haiquan has grown into a burly and strong farmer, of medium height, and seems to be full of vitality. He always rushes to do the heavy work in the fields, carrying loads and dredging mud, all without any difficulty. On the basketball court, he is a valiant general, and every time the village has a ball game, he is indispensable. Because of his active work, Wu Haiquan was honorably selected as a Qingpu Youth Socialist Activist. This year during the Spring Festival, Wu Haiquan married a girl from a neighboring village. Twelve other young couples got married at the same time as Haiquan.

"Schistosomiasis, a plague, spreads disaster in Ren Village.
Only death, no birth, no girls want to marry into Ren Village."

"Haiquan, do you still remember this song?" A mischievous youth deliberately joked with Haiquan.

"This song is long outdated. Our production is good, and girls from neighboring villages all want to marry into Ren Village!"

This sentence caused a burst of laughter, but the faces of six or seven brides turned red—because they were all married from neighboring villages.

From 1950 to 1958, everyone in Ren Village who had schistosomiasis was cured. Shanghai doctors performed spleen removals on the ten most serious patients, and each surgery cost the state two to three hundred yuan. Villager Bu Wenzhou said, "The public grain we've handed in these past few years isn't even enough for the state to use to treat our illnesses!"

In the winter of 1956, a snail eradication campaign was launched throughout the village. At night, gasoline lamps illuminated the fields, and two to three hundred people from the entire village were mobilized to kill snails. The northwest wind was blowing hard, and Ren Village was even more lively than New Year's Eve: hoeing weeds, spraying fire, spreading medicine, all busy. It was truly:

“The silver hoes fall on the Five Ridges, linking the sky,
The iron arms shake the Three Rivers, making the earth tremble.” By the end of 1958, Ren Village had cured the last patient with schistosomiasis and basically eliminated snails.

Since the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, the population of Ren Village has prospered. Now, out of the 609 people, 139 are between the ages of one and nine. Production has also developed greatly. In 1958, the rice yield per mu was 610 catties, almost double the amount in the early days of liberation. After the establishment of the People's Commune, this year will increase by more than 50% compared to last year. Before liberation, out of the 120 households in Ren Village, 80 households often didn't have enough to eat. This year, each person in Ren Village (regardless of age) has an average of 520 catties of rations. Today, the farmers of Ren Village sing:

Happiness all depends on the Communist Party, Chairman Mao's leadership is like the sun.
Production and treatment both have bumper harvests, crops are abundant and people are prosperous.

The cloud of sorrow and despair over Ren Village has long been swept away by the joyful songs of the farmers. The interconnected lakes and ponds around Ren Village were once the breeding grounds for schistosomiasis; in the future, they will gradually be built into scenic areas. The beautiful scenery here will attract tourists from all over. If there really is a kind-hearted "Cowherd" in the sky, he will definitely come to Ren Village—not to "ask about the plague god," but to appreciate the flourishing scenery of this new socialist countryside and share the happiness of socialism!

    江南红雨
    顾寿康　朱习理　吴关明
    任屯村，远远望去，像一片青翠的荷叶，静静地躺在青浦淀山湖畔。夏日熏风吹拂，醉人的稻香漫野飘荡。多么茁壮的水稻啊！任屯生产队提出了水稻亩产千斤的指标。人民公社的水风车，遍布全村，风帆转动，宛如白色的鲜花开放；水潺潺地流进稻田。两个月没下雨了，可是任屯村没有一块土地是干裂的。
    傍晚，人们从田头归来，树荫下面，食堂的晚饭已经摆好了。公社有线广播站正播送着农民爱听的沪剧；村西篮球场上，尘土飞扬，小伙子们连饭也顾不上吃，就打起球来；小孩子嬉笑着各处奔跑……。
    凄凉的村庄
    第一次来到任屯村，怎么也想不到这个“春风杨柳万千条”的幸福村庄，十多年前竟是“万户萧疏鬼唱歌”的地方。任屯村每个侥幸地活下来的中年以上的农民，都清楚地记得，十年前的任屯村是多么凄凉！那时候：全村二千八百亩稻田，荒芜了一半，就是已耕种的一千多亩，用农民的话来说，也“分不出是稗草多还是稻苗多”。耕地的人哪里去了？
    村里五十多座房屋坍倒，有些没有倒塌的房屋，室内空寂无人，长满了野草。房子的主人呢？
    这里听不到婴孩的哭嚷和儿童的笑声，甚至看不见一块晾在外面的尿布。新生的一代又在哪里？
    愁云惨雾深锁着任屯村——任屯村被瘟神纠缠得奄奄一息了，怎么会有一点儿生气呢？瘟神，像血吸虫一样剥削人民血汗的国民党，像国民党一样吮吸人民鲜血的血吸虫，使任屯村多少人家家破人亡！
    东邻白发叹凄凉，西舍儿童失爹娘，田荒地白空屋闲，全村片片哭声嚷！
    这首哀歌包含着诉说不完的悲剧！在国民党统治的二十年间，血吸虫病大流行，任屯村的人大批地死亡。1930年，全村还有九百六十人，到1949年，只剩下四百六十一人。何秀根一家的遭遇，就是解放前任屯村农民悲惨命运的缩影。
    村南原来住着贫苦农民何秀根一家七口。从1937年起，他们先后得了血吸虫病。请医生，光出诊费按路程计算就要一石米多，一般农民根本负担不起。即使病人到几十里路外的镇上去看病，医生也只是用抽腹水的办法敷衍。几年工夫，这个七口之家，死得只剩何秀根和他的大儿子松发了。他们两人，这时也得了血吸虫病。他家租了地主四亩地，其中二亩八分的收成归地主。由于家里连年死人，何秀根实在交不出租米，“官厅”就派人来抓何秀根。秀根一听“官厅”来捉人，就冒着深秋的寒风漏夜逃到村外。秀根躲过了官厅，仍躲不过死亡。惊忧交加，贫病交迫，不多久，秀根死了。
    松发是个倔性子的人，他这个有腹水的晚期血吸虫病人已经丧失了劳动能力，却不得不挣扎着下田。弯腰割草时间稍久，就头昏眼花，站都站不直；踏水车时，腹部阵阵绞痛，痛得他头上直冒汗。
    “松发，你歇一歇吧……”松发的堂弟林高看到这情形，总是心酸得忍不住劝他。
    “歇歇？债呢？吃的呢？”松发咬紧牙关，甚至不肯多说一个字。“欠债主租米受债主气”，为了多挣些钱还债，松发白天拖着带病的身子操劳，晚上又下池塘摸鱼；血汗钱还没拿到手，就不属于自己的了。租米、高利贷、壮丁税……轮到自己，能剩下什么呢！
    1948年，阴历四月二十日下了一场大风雨。第二天一早，松发就去堵沟。傍晚回家累得倒在床上，大口大口的血往外吐。当地人知道，得了“大胞病”，会“冲血”的。林高闻讯立即赶来看他，接了好几盆鲜血，松发昏迷不醒，接着脉搏停止了。何秀根一家就这样死绝。
    现在，何林高谈到他伯父一家的时候，无限感慨地说：“要是他们能熬到解放，就有救了！我们何家四房，三房都是患血吸虫病死的，剩下的只我们一房。”从1930年到解放前夕，像何秀根这样死绝的家庭，在任屯村不是三户五户，而是整整八十户！还有二十八户每户死剩一人。
    “共产党来救命了”
    “要是他们能熬到解放……”任屯村人，怀念死者，总是惋惜地说这句话。解放了，政治上的瘟神国民党被消灭了，自然界的瘟神——血吸虫也日暮途穷。1950年夏天，华东军政委员会卫生部的首长来到任屯村。一位负责同志意味深长地说：旧社会，血吸虫摆布人的命运；新社会，人民要摆布血吸虫的命运了！首长们离开任屯村不久，就派来了十几名医务人员，开展血吸虫的防治工作。在村里的空场上，医生向农民讲解血吸虫的危害。
    “解放前，人家都说‘稻田不好出稗草，运道不好得大胞’，祖坟风水不好，是医不好的！”大家七嘴八舌地议论起来。
    医生让大家看显微镜下的毛蚴，“风水”、“运道”之类的迷信思想动摇了；血吸虫病防治工作组给人们深潭古井般的心里，投下希望的阳光。
    “共产党来救我们的命了！”农民们含着眼泪，纷纷挤上前去握医生的手。
    共产党来救命了！经过检查，这个村四百六十一人中，竟有四百四十九人有血吸虫卵，感染率达97％以上！如果不及时医治，瘟神又会夺去多少生命！从1950年到1952年，在任屯村分三批免费治好二百多人，以后几年，每年都送几十人到血吸虫防治站去治疗。面黄肌瘦的一年年少下去，身强力壮的一年年多起来。
    吴海泉的故事
    在这些人中间，有一个叫吴海泉的，十几岁时得了血吸虫病。人家都这样形容他：“肚皮像冬瓜（大），面孔像南瓜（黄），手臂像丝瓜（细），头颈像黄瓜（小）。二十岁的吴海泉看来就像八、九岁的小孩子一样。海泉的妈妈从邻村给他抱来一个童养媳春金。海泉和春金的感情也满好。两个人都二十出头了，春金看看自己的未婚夫像个小孩子，身体又衰弱，不能劳动，将来怎样和他长期生活下去呢？为自己前途着想，春金决定离开海泉家。一个早晨，春金带着一个小包袱走了。海泉妈忍不住哭起来。海泉真的活不长了吗？他爸爸也是得这种病死的，这孩子也会像他父亲一样……海泉妈再也不敢往下想，越哭越伤心。
    然而，时代不同了。海泉父亲的时代，把千千万万个海泉的父亲折磨死；海泉的时代，却能把千千万万个海泉从死亡的边缘拉回来！虽然海泉的病已经严重得几乎难以治疗，政府还是竭尽一切力量挽救他。患这种晚期病的人是有危险性的，医生、护士对他特别关心，稍有些不舒服，医务人员就跑来看护，还用了好些贵重的药品。从那时起，二十一岁的海泉才开始发育。“小枯苗”在党的培育下返青了！1956年，海泉身体渐渐复元，政府又一次送海泉出去医疗，把他的血吸虫病彻底治好。“是党和毛主席把我从棺材里救出来的！”海泉对别人谈到他的过去时，总是激动地说出这句肺腑之言。“要是没有共产党，海泉他们现在骨头都要烂掉了！”村里人也这样说。
    现在，海泉已经成长为一个粗壮结实的农民，中等的身材，仿佛全身充溢着活力。田头的重活他总抢着干，挑担、罱泥，全不在话下。篮球场上，他是一员骁将，村里每次比球都少不了他。由于工作积极，吴海泉光荣地被选为青浦青年社会主义积极分子。今年春节，吴海泉和邻村的一位姑娘结婚了。和海泉同时结婚的，还有十二对青年。
    “血吸虫，害人精，任屯村中传祸根。
    只见死，不见生，有女不嫁任屯村。”
    “海泉，你还记得这只歌吗？”调皮的青年故意和海泉开玩笑。
    “这个歌早就过时了。我们生产搞得好，邻村姑娘都想嫁到任屯村来！”
    这句话引起哄堂大笑，六、七个新娘的脸却飞红了——因为她们都是邻村嫁来的。
    从1950年到1958年，任屯村所有患血吸虫病的都医好了。十个最严重的病人，由上海的医师进行了脾脏摘除，每个动手术的病人要花国家二、三百元。社员卜文舟说，“这几年来我们交的公粮，国家用来为我们治病还不够哩！” 
    1956年冬天，全村开展了灭钉螺运动。夜晚，汽油灯照彻田野，全村出动二、三百人灭螺。西北风刮得正紧，任屯村比除夕还热闹：锄草的，喷火的，撒药的，忙成一片。正是：
  “天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇。”到1958年底，任屯村医好了最后一个血吸虫病的病人，基本消灭了钉螺。
    防治血吸虫以来，任屯村人口兴旺了，现在六百零九人中，一岁到九岁的就有一百三十九人。生产也有很大的发展。1958年水稻亩产六百一十斤，比解放初期增加近一倍。成立人民公社后，今年将比去年再增加五成以上。解放以前，任屯村一百二十户人家，有八十户经常没有饭吃。今年，任屯村每人（不分大小）平均有口粮五百二十斤。今天，任屯村农民唱道：
    幸福全靠共产党，毛主席领导像太阳。
    生产治病双丰收，五谷丰登人兴旺。
    任屯村上空的愁云惨雾，早被农民欢乐的歌声冲得无影无踪了。任屯村边连环般的湖荡，曾经是血吸虫的传播地；今后，它将逐步建设成为风景区。这里美丽的景色，将吸引各地的游人。如果天上真有好心的“牛郎”，他一定会到任屯村来的——不是来“问瘟神事”，而是来领略这欣欣向荣的新农村的风光，共享社会主义的幸福！　（原载上海文汇报）
