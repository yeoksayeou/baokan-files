Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 18th: Mrs. Isabelle Blum, member of the Presidium of the World Peace Council, who is currently visiting Vietnam, issued a statement at a press conference here today condemning the United States for slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with "aggression" against Laos.

Mrs. Blum arrived in Vietnam on August 28th at the invitation of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace. From September 11th to 16th, she made a special trip to many places along the Vietnam-Laos border, especially to those places where newspapers with a U.S. background had propagated the so-called massive concentration of Vietnamese troops and shelling of Laos.

In a statement issued as a result of her visit, Mrs. Blum pointed out that in those border areas with extremely inconvenient transportation, there was neither a large concentration of Vietnamese troops nor a concentration of artillery units. On the contrary, she personally witnessed Lao aircraft violating the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Mrs. Blum said that the slanders by the U.S. propaganda machine are crude and ulterior, with the aim of making the people of Western countries hostile to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. She said, "The purpose of this slander is also to prevent the International Commission for Laos from resuming its activities and to legitimize the intervention of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries."

She said that the United Nations' "investigation sub-committee" on the Laotian issue was established with ulterior motives.

Mrs. Blum emphasized, "The facts I have seen prove that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is committed to economic construction. It has always respected the Geneva Accords and has no intention of interfering in Laos." She said, "It is clear that the slanderous arguments of U.S. imperialism precisely prove its own aggressive conspiracy, which is to attempt to turn Laos and Indochina into military bases to oppose the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and China. This action is dangerous."

In her statement, Mrs. Blum said, "Submitting the Laotian issue to the United Nations, using the flag of the United Nations to cover up the conspiracy of aggression, and sending an investigation sub-committee to Laos precisely when Khrushchev is visiting the United States, these actions expose the true intentions of the implementers of imperialism and the policy of strength: to obstruct the relaxation of the situation."

The statement concluded, "In order to maintain peace in Southeast Asia, the investigation sub-committee that violates the United Nations Charter must be withdrawn from Laos immediately, the activities of the International Commission for Laos must be restored, military assistance to Laos must be stopped, and the Geneva Conference must be reconvened to prevent the intervention of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Laos. Finally, the Lao people must be allowed to handle their own affairs, because judging from the Vientiane Agreements, they know what they need, which is unity and independence."

### 布伦姆夫人谴责美国对越南的诬蔑  不是越南侵略老挝　是老挝侵犯越南

    布伦姆夫人谴责美国对越南的诬蔑
    不是越南侵略老挝　是老挝侵犯越南
    据新华社河内18日电　正在越南访问的世界和平理事会主席团委员伊莎贝丽·布伦姆夫人今天在这里举行的记者招待会上发表声明，谴责美国诬蔑越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝。
    布伦姆夫人是应越南保卫世界和平委员会的邀请在8月28日到达越南访问的。9月11日到16日，她特地到越老边界的许多地方，特别是那些美国背景的报纸宣传的所谓越南部队大量集结并向老挝开炮的地方去访问。
    布伦姆夫人在作为访问结果发表的声明中指出，在那些交通异常不便的边境地区，既没有大量越南部队的集结，也没有炮兵部队的集中，相反，她亲眼看到了老挝飞机侵犯了越南民主共和国的领空。
    布伦姆夫人说，美国宣传机关的诬蔑是粗暴的，别有用心的，目的在于使西方国家人民敌视越南民主共和国。她说：“这种诬蔑的目的还在于阻止老挝国际委员会恢复活动，使东南亚条约组织国家的干涉成为合法。”
    她说，联合国的老挝问题“调查小组委员会”是别有用心地成立起来的。
    布伦姆夫人强调说：“我所看到的事实证明，越南民主共和国正在致力于经济建设。它一向尊重日内瓦协议，没有干涉老挝的任何企图。”她说，“很显然，美帝国主义的诬蔑论调恰恰证明了它自己的侵略阴谋，就是企图把老挝和印度支那变成军事基地，来反对越南民主共和国和中国。这个行动是危险的。”
    布伦姆夫人在声明中说，“把老挝问题提交联合国，利用联合国的旗帜来掩饰侵略的阴谋和恰恰在赫鲁晓夫访问美国的时候派一个调查小组委员会到老挝，这些行动暴露了帝国主义和实力政策的执行者的真正意图：就是阻挠局势的缓和。”
    声明最后说，“为了维护东南亚的和平，必须立即把违反联合国宪章的调查小组委员会撤出老挝，恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，停止对老挝的军事援助，重新召开日内瓦会议来防止东南亚条约组织对老挝的干涉。最后，必须让老挝人民自己处理自己的事务，因为从万象协议看来，他们懂得自己所需要的东西，那就是统一和独立。”
