Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Telegram The workers of Taiyuan Jinxi Machine Factory, focusing on the production of complete sets of products, launched opponent competitions and chain competitions, promoting and cooperating with each other, and completed the state plan for the third quarter twenty days ahead of schedule.

As of September 10, all production indicators of this factory have been completed. Among them, the total output value plan was completed by 108%, the commodity output value plan was completed by 100.31%, the labor productivity plan was completed by 119.77%, and the cost was reduced by 3.3% compared with the plan.

Since November 1957, this factory has overfulfilled the state plan for 22 consecutive months. In early August, the workers criticized the right-leaning and slack mood existing in some cadres, set off a new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, launched opponent competitions, new production records continued to appear, and the old balance between various processes was broken, and a new imbalance appeared. After research, the factory party committee affirmed that the chain competition form of joint operations around the completion of product sets that had already appeared in various workshops at that time was a good way to solve this problem, so it was promoted. The entire factory, focusing on the factory's overall tasks and the completion of key product sets, launched a large chain competition, so that the production of various departments, workshops, sections, and groups was interconnected and developed in a balanced manner. For example, the boilers they manufactured each weighed more than 30 tons, and the parts consisted of 199 types with more than 12,000 pieces, which required the labor of four workshops, thousands of processes, and nearly a thousand people. In order to ensure timely assembly in complete sets, the assembly workshop challenged the supply section, requesting timely supply of materials; challenged the machining workshop, requesting timely supply of parts; and challenged the tool workshop, requesting timely supply of tools. While responding to the challenge from the assembly workshop, the machining workshop challenged the foundry workshop, requesting timely supply of castings. As a result, the boiler production plan for September was completed two days ahead of schedule.

The in-depth development of the chain competition has promoted the further development of the communist spirit of cooperation among various units. Many workshops, sections, and groups, after completing their own tasks ahead of schedule, actively drew out forces to help fraternal workshops and fraternal groups. At the same time, because the processes were closely connected and promoted each other, the previous phenomenon of slack production in the early stages and tight production in the later stages was reversed, and balanced production and balanced assembly were achieved.

    大发动　大促进　事事协作　人人争先
    晋西机器厂连环赛奏功效
    道道工序连成一体　季度计划提前完成
    新华社太原电　太原晋西机器厂职工以成套产品的生产为中心，开展对手赛、连环赛，互相促进互相协作，提前二十天完成了第三季度的国家计划。
    到9月10日为止，这个厂的各项生产指标都已完成。其中，总产值计划完成108％，商品产值计划完成100.31％，劳动生产率计划完成119.77％，成本比计划降低3.3％。
    这个厂从1957年11月开始，连续二十二个月超额完成了国家计划。8月初，职工们批判了存在于部分干部中的右倾松劲情绪，掀起了新的增产节约运动高潮，开展了对手竞赛，生产新纪录不断出现，各个工序之间突破了旧的平衡，而出现了新的不平衡状况。工厂党委研究后，肯定当时各车间已经出现的围绕产品成套而联合作战的连环竞赛形式，是解决这个问题的好办法，于是予以推广。全厂以厂的总任务和重点产品的成套为中心，开展大连环竞赛，使各个科室、车间、工段、小组的生产都互相衔接，平衡发展。如他们承制的锅炉，每台重达三十吨以上，部件有一百九十九种共一万二千多件，要经过四个车间、千余道工序和近千人的劳动。装配车间为了保证按时成套装配，向供应科挑战，要求按时供应材料；向机械加工车间挑战，要求按时供应部件；向工具车间挑战，要求按时供应工具。机械加工车间在向装配车间应战的同时，又向铸工车间挑战，要求按时供应铸件。结果，9月份的锅炉生产计划便提前两天完成。
    连环竞赛的深入发展，促使各单位进一步发扬了共产主义协作精神。许多车间、工段、小组，在提前完成本身任务以后，都主动地抽出力量帮助兄弟车间和兄弟小组。同时，由于一道道工序衔接得很紧密，相互促进，所以扭转了以往生产前松后紧的现象，达到了均衡生产、均衡装配。
