This newspaper's Xi'an dispatch on the 3rd: The Shangluo District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has called on farmers throughout the district to vigorously launch a campaign to increase vegetable production by 1,000 jin per household. From August 5th to 28th, after more than 200,000 laborers rushed to plant, the district has used more than 96,000 mu of land around houses, on barren slopes, and along field edges to sow vegetables, estimating that each household can increase autumn vegetable production by about 1,200 jin.

Since July, Shangluo District has had very little rainfall, and most areas are experiencing drought. In light of this situation, the Shangluo District Party Committee mobilized the entire party and all the people to go all out to carry out a campaign to combat drought and protect the autumn harvest, and at the same time called on the masses to plant more autumn vegetables. The county party committees, according to the instructions of the district party committee, have conducted serious studies and quickly implemented them in the communes and production teams, requiring cadres at all levels to actively lead the masses to rush to plant autumn vegetables. The district party committee also determined that small plots of wasteland around houses, field ridges, field edges, canal edges, and roadsides should be cultivated and harvested by those who plant them; larger wastelands should be planted by production teams or smaller teams, and the output should not be included in the "three guarantees" (三包) output, and the income should belong to the planting units, with income distributed according to labor days. The production teams also helped commune members solve difficulties such as labor, time, and seeds.

In this way, the movement to increase the planting of autumn vegetables quickly formed a climax throughout the district. In Shang County, more than 28,000 laborers fought for five days and used vacant land to plant vegetables and miscellaneous grains on 18,577 mu, and also replanted vegetables on more than 28,000 mu of autumn fields that had been damaged by drought. In the Qingshan Management Area of ​​the Fushui Commune in this county, 930 households planted 657 mu of vegetables, buckwheat, and small beans in three days, exceeding the original plan of more than three times the three-fen land per household.

    弥补旱灾带来的损失
    商?专区开展每户增产千斤菜运动
    本报西安3日电　中共商?地委号召全专区农民大力开展每户增产千斤蔬菜的运动。由8月5日到28日，经过二十多万劳力突击抢种，全区已利用房前屋后、荒坡、地边播种蔬菜九万六千多亩，估计每户可增产秋菜一千二百斤左右。
    商?专区7月以来降雨很少，大部地区干旱。根据这种情况，商?地委动员全党全民全力以赴，开展了抗旱保秋运动，同时号召群众多种秋菜。各县委根据地委指示，都作了认真研究，迅速贯彻到各公社和生产队，要求各级干部，积极领导群众抢种秋菜。地委还确定，屋前屋后、田埂、地边、渠边路边小块荒地实行谁种谁收；较大的荒地由生产队或小队种植，不计算三包产量，归各种植单位所有，收入按劳动日分配。各生产队还帮助社员解决了劳力、时间、种子等困难。
    这样，增种秋菜的运动很快的就在全区形成高潮。商县二万八千多名劳力，奋战了五天，就利用空闲地种菜和小杂粮一万八千五百七十七亩，并给二万八千多亩受旱遭到损失的秋田补种了蔬菜。这个县富水公社青山管理区九百三十户，三天就种植蔬菜、荞麦、小豆六百五十七亩，超过了原来每户计划三分地的三倍多。　（徐志善）
