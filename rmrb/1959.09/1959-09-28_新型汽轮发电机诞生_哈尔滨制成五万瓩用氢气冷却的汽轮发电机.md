Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 27th. China's first 50,000 kW hydrogen-cooled turbo generator was successfully trial-produced at the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory on the 26th of this month. After various performance tests and the evaluation of the appraisal committee organized by the First Ministry of Machine Building, it was proven that the quality of this generator meets the requirements and can be put into mass production.

The successful trial production of this turbo generator marks another significant step forward in China's electrical machinery manufacturing technology.

Adopting the advanced technology of hydrogen cooling method instead of the ordinary air cooling method is an important way to increase the capacity of the motor. Because hydrogen is lighter than air, dissipates heat quickly, and has high cooling efficiency. According to calculations, this 50,000 kW turbo generator using hydrogen cooling can generate 328,000 more kilowatt-hours of electricity per year than a turbo generator of the same size using air cooling. At the same time, because the motor temperature is reduced, the service life of the motor is also prolonged. The hydrogen control system used in this motor is fully automated and semi-automated.

This generator is made of high-grade insulation materials and high-grade alloy steel. With the help of Soviet experts, and the assistance and support of brother factories and universities, the workers of Harbin Electric Machinery Factory overcame many difficulties and manufactured this generator in only seven months.

    新型汽轮发电机诞生
    哈尔滨制成五万瓩用氢气冷却的汽轮发电机
    新华社哈尔滨27日电　我国第一台五万瓩用氢气冷却的汽轮发电机本月26日在哈尔滨电机厂试制成功。经过各项性能试验，加上第一机械工业部组织的鉴定委员会的鉴定，证明这台发电机的质量合乎要求，可以成批投入生产。
    这台汽轮发电机的试制成功，标志着我国电机制造技术水平又向前推进了一大步。
    采用先进技术氢气冷却方法代替普通的空气冷却方法，是增大电机容量的一个重要途径。因为氢气比空气轻，散热快，冷却效率高。据计算，这台采用氢气冷却的五万瓩的汽轮发电机，比同样大小的、用空气冷却的汽轮发电机，每年可以多发出三十二万八千多度电。同时，因为电机温度降低，还延长了电机的使用寿命。这台电机所用的氢气控制系统，全部使用自动化和半自动化操作。
    这台发电机是用高级绝缘材料和高级合金钢制成的。哈尔滨电机厂的职工在苏联专家帮助下，在兄弟工厂和高等学校协助支援下，克服了重重困难，只用了七个月的时间，就制成了这台发电机。
