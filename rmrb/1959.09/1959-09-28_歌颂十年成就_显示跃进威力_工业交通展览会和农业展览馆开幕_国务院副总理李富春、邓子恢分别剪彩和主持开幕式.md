Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: The National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition (1949-1959) officially opened today.

The exhibition is located in the Beijing Exhibition Center. Today, the inside and outside of the center were filled with joy. On the square in front of the exhibition center, eighteen colorful patterns representing various industrial and transportation undertakings were hung on the north side, and sixteen red flags were clustered around two five-star national flags fluttering in the wind on the south side. The lotus fountain in the center of the square's pool sprayed water. The seventy-meter-high gold-plated spire shone brightly in the bright sunshine.

At 10:00 a.m., Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun cut the ribbon amidst celebratory firecrackers. Several thousand spectators waiting on the square poured into the various pavilions of the exhibition. Guides enthusiastically introduced each exhibit to the audience. After the ribbon-cutting, the Whirlwind-25 helicopter exhibited here performed a flight show in the sky above the exhibition center for the audience.

Among those who came to visit the exhibition today were ministers and vice-ministers from the central industrial, transportation, and commercial departments, foreign guests from some countries visiting China, more than 3,000 labor models from all over the country and various ethnic groups who came to Beijing to attend the 10th anniversary National Day celebrations, and more than 900 returned students who recently returned to the country.

Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun wrote in the exhibition's guestbook that this year's industrial and transportation exhibition not only demonstrates the achievements of the ten years since the founding of the country but also demonstrates the Great Leap Forward of last year and this year. Workers from Shijingshan and returned students and many other visitors wrote in the guestbooks of various pavilions, warmly congratulating the brilliant achievements of China's industrial and transportation undertakings in the past ten years, praising the Great Leap Forward, and praising the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Some foreign guests also left messages congratulating China's industrial and transportation achievements over the past ten years. Baba, the production team leader of the Chaka People's Commune in Qinghai, a Tibetan, and the Tibetans who came with him to visit Beijing, clapped happily while sitting by the pool in front of the exhibition center, talking about the large machines they had seen.

On the day before the opening of the exhibition, Vice Premiers of the State Council Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, and heads of the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, and other departments came to view the exhibition.

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Celebrating the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the country, the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall officially opened in the capital this afternoon. It showcased the brilliant achievements of China's agricultural front over the past ten years, especially the victories of the agricultural Great Leap Forward and the people's commune system since 1958.

At 3:00 p.m., the opening ceremony was presided over by Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui. When Deng Zihui announced the official opening of the National Agricultural Exhibition, the thousands of labor model representatives from all over the country who attended the opening ceremony applauded warmly. Then, firecrackers went off all around the square. After Deng Zihui cut the ribbon, he and all the labor model representatives entered the hall for a tour.

The exhibition hall has eleven pavilions, including the Comprehensive Pavilion, the Crop Pavilion, the Horticultural Specialty Pavilion, the Water Conservancy Pavilion, the Measures Pavilion, the Tool Pavilion, the Forestry Pavilion, the Animal Husbandry Pavilion, the Aquatic Products Pavilion, the Meteorology Pavilion, and the People's Commune Industry Pavilion. Each pavilion is large in scale and rich in content, surpassing previous national agricultural exhibitions. It showcases the tremendous changes in China's rural areas under the leadership of the Party over the past ten years, from the land reform to the great course of the people's commune system; it showcases the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries over the past ten years, especially the development since the Great Leap Forward and the development of the people's commune industry, as well as the gradual improvement of farmers' lives with the development of production. The exhibition hall also showcases the rich experience of China's agricultural production development over the past ten years and the victory of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

This exhibition also fully demonstrates the richness of the motherland's products. Hundreds of exhibits come from all corners of the motherland, from timber from the Greater Khingan Mountains to tropical crops from Hainan Island, from grazing horses on the Northwest Plateau to highland barley from Tibet.

The first batch of visitors today were labor model representatives from all over the country who came to the capital to participate in the National Day celebrations. They visited very carefully. The representatives unanimously reflected that they were even more motivated after seeing the exhibition and that they must respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and better complete and overfulfill this year's production and construction tasks.
