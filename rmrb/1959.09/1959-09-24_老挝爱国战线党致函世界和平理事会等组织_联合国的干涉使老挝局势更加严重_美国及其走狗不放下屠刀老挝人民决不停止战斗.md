Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 21st: According to a Vietnam News Agency report, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party emphasized in a letter to the World Peace Council that "The current problem in Laos is entirely the struggle of the Lao people against US imperialism and the Sananikone government to strive for the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements."

The letter continued, "Therefore, this problem can only be resolved through the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements under the supervision and monitoring of the International Commission and with the attention of the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference."

Phay Dang, Vice Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, expressed fierce opposition to the United Nations Security Council's appointment of a so-called "investigation sub-committee." He pointed out that this "sub-committee" cannot promote a resolution to the Lao problem; in reality, it can only complicate and aggravate the problem.

The letter stated, "At the same time, the United States and certain countries belonging to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc are accelerating the transportation of military personnel and equipment into Laos in order to illegally help the Sananikone government expand the civil war and carry out suppression and terror against the Lao people."

The letter said, "In order to create the necessary conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Lao problem, it is important that US imperialists stop interfering in Laos, that the Lao Royal Government must not take persecution and terror actions against the people, that it must release Prince Souphanouvong and other patriots who are still being detained, and that it must agree to restore the work of the Lao International Commission. If the Sananikone government continues to follow the policies of US imperialism and continues to implement its anti-national and anti-people policies, the Lao people will resolutely struggle until final victory."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 22nd: According to a Vietnam News Agency report, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party wrote a letter to the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, expressing heartfelt gratitude for the Council's support for the Lao people's struggle for peace, national independence, and neutrality. At the same time, it expressed hope that the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council would protest against the illegal decision of the United Nations Security Council and called on the people of Afro-Asian countries to continue to support the Lao people's struggle to defend Laos' peace, neutrality, independence, and democracy, and to maintain peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The letter said: Recently, US imperialism, using the excuse of "the danger of communist aggression in Laos," manipulated the United Nations Security Council to establish a so-called "investigation sub-committee" on the Lao situation. This shamelessly violates international law and the United Nations Charter, as well as the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The letter pointed out that while the "investigation sub-committee" is preparing to go to Laos, US imperialists and some Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries are stepping up the transportation of military personnel and weapons to Laos to help the Sananikone government expand the civil war. At the same time, government officials from the United States, the Kingdom of Laos, and some member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, such as Thailand and the Philippines, are clamoring to send troops to Laos, attempting to turn Laos into a hotbed of war and striving to poison the international atmosphere.

The letter also said that it is noteworthy that a Japanese representative has been appointed as the chairman of the "investigation sub-committee," while the American weapons illegally transported into Laos are in fact from Japan. Therefore, it is obvious that the establishment of this "sub-committee" is a sinister conspiracy by US imperialists and their accomplices, aimed at undermining the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements, doing their utmost to expand the civil war in Laos, suppressing the Lao people, and paving the way for US imperialists to step up their armed intervention in Laos.

The letter further stated that the Lao problem "investigation sub-committee" not only cannot solve the Lao problem, but in fact makes the situation even more serious.

The letter advocates that the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Front Party hold negotiations on the basis of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements. The prerequisite for such peaceful negotiations is that US imperialism must first stop interfering in Laos, the Lao Royal Government must immediately stop the civil war, restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other patriotic fighters who are still imprisoned, and restore the activities of the Lao International Commission.

The letter emphasized that if US imperialists and their running dogs continue to trample on justice, infringe upon Laos' sovereignty, and violate the principles already adopted at the Asian-African Bandung Conference, the Lao people have no other choice but to continue fighting until final victory.

    老挝爱国战线党致函世界和平理事会等组织
    联合国的干涉使老挝局势更加严重
    美国及其走狗不放下屠刀老挝人民决不停止战斗
    据新华社河内21日电　据越南通讯社报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在写给世界和平理事会的一封信中着重指出，“老挝目前的问题完全是老挝人民为反对美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府以争取执行日内瓦协议和万象协议而进行的斗争。”
    这封信又说，“因此，这个问题只能够在国际委员会的监察和监督下和在1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席的关注下，通过正确地执行日内瓦协议和万象协议来解决。”
    老挝爱国战线党副主席费当表示激烈反对联合国安全理事会任命所谓“调查小组委员会”。他指出，这个“小组委员会”不能促使老挝问题获得解决，实际上这只能使问题复杂化和更加严重。
    这封信说，“同时，美国和某些属于东南亚条约组织军事集团的国家正在加速把军事人员和装备运入老挝，以便非法地帮助萨纳尼空政府扩大内战，并且对老挝人民进行镇压和恐怖统治。”
    这封信说，“为了创造和平解决老挝问题的必要条件，重要的是，美帝国主义者必须停止对老挝进行干涉，老挝王国政府必须不对人民采取迫害和恐怖行动，必须释放苏发努冯亲王和其他仍然被拘禁的爱国者，并且同意恢复老挝国际委员会的工作。如果萨纳尼空政府仍然追随美帝国主义的政策而继续执行它的反民族、反人民的政策，老挝人民将坚决地进行斗争，直到取得最后的胜利。”
    据新华社河内22日电　据越南通讯社报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会写信给亚非人民团结理事会书记处，表示衷心感激理事会支持老挝人民争取和平、民族独立与中立的斗争。同时表示希望亚非人民团结理事会对联合国安全理事会的非法决定提出抗议，并且呼吁亚非各国人民继续支持老挝人民为保卫老挝的和平、中立、独立和民主以及维护印度支那与东南亚的和平所作的斗争。信中说：最近，美帝国主义借口“在老挝存在共产党侵略的危险”，操纵联合国安全理事会成立了所谓的老挝局势“调查小组委员会”。这厚颜无耻地违反了国际法和联合国宪章以及关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    信件指出，在“调查小组委员会”准备去老挝的同时，美帝国主义者和一些东南亚条约组织国家加紧将军事人员和武器运往老挝以帮助萨纳尼空政府扩大内战。与此同时，美国、老挝王国和东南亚条约组织的一些成员国，如泰国和菲律宾等国的政府负责人士叫嚷派军队去老挝，企图把老挝变为战争温床，力图毒化国际气氛。
    信件又说，值得注意的是，一位日本代表被任命为“调查小组委员会”的主席，而非法运进老挝的美国武器却在事实上来自日本。因此，显而易见，这个“小组委员会”的设立，是美帝国主义者和他们的帮凶的阴险的阴谋，其目的在于破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议、竭力扩大老挝内战、镇压老挝人民，并且为美帝国主义者在老挝加紧进行武装干涉铺平道路。
    信中又说，老挝问题“调查小组委员会”不仅不能解决老挝问题，而且事实上使局势变得更加严重。
    信中主张老挝王国政府和老挝爱国战线党在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上举行谈判。这种和平谈判的先决条件是，美帝国主义首先必须停止干涉老挝，老挝王国政府必须立即停止内战，恢复仍被监禁的苏发努冯亲王和其它爱国战士的自由，以及恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。
    信中强调说，如果美帝国主义者及其走狗继续践踏正义，侵犯老挝的主权和违反亚非万隆会议已经通过的原则的话，老挝人民别无其它办法，只好继续战斗，直到最后胜利为止。（附图片）
