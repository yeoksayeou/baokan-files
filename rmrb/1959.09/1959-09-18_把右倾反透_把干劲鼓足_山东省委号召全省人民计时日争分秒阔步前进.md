    Thoroughly Repudiate Rightism, Fully Boost Enthusiasm
    Shandong Provincial Party Committee Calls on People of the Entire Province to Seize Every Minute and Second and March Forward with Great Strides

    (Reported by this newspaper) At the expanded meeting of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held from August 24 to September 11, the attendees cited a large number of facts to powerfully refute the attacks by domestic and foreign hostile elements and a few right-leaning opportunists within the Party against the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement. They also enthusiastically launched competitions at the meeting, determined to respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions.

    The meeting earnestly conveyed and discussed the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. "Opposing Rightism, Boosting Enthusiasm, and Immediately Launching a New Upsurge in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement" was the central topic of this meeting.

    In group meetings and speeches at the general assembly, everyone cited the facts of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and various undertakings in Shandong Province to prove that the General Line was completely correct and the People's Communes were incomparably superior. Taking steel production as an example, Shandong started completely from scratch. In August of last year, the province only had two blast furnaces with a volume of 84 cubic meters and three with a volume of 13 cubic meters (even these blast furnaces were built last summer). After more than a year of efforts, the province now has two blast furnaces with a volume of 255 cubic meters, twenty-one with a volume of 55 to 100 cubic meters, one hundred and twenty-two with a volume of 8 to 28 cubic meters, and three hundred and forty-eight with a volume of 3 cubic meters. At this time last year, Lin Yi City held a celebration meeting when the local "pig snout furnaces" produced two jin of indigenous iron. On September 6th this year, the daily output of pig iron in the province broke through the 5,000-ton mark. From August to December last year, the province produced 505,000 tons of pig iron and 53,000 tons of good steel. From January to August this year, it produced another 810,000 tons of pig iron and 98,000 tons of steel. The qualified rate of pig iron in the province from January to August was over 73%, and the qualified rate of steel was 90%. Due to the foundation laid by the "small indigenous groups" last year, small blast furnaces have quickly developed into "small modern groups" and even some "large modern groups" this year. This is obviously an amazing miracle. Under the leadership of the principle of "taking steel as the key link," all industrial sectors in the province achieved leapfrog development last year. Coal production increased from 6.16 million tons in 1957 to 13.73 million tons; electricity increased from 700 million kilowatt-hours to 1.09 billion kilowatt-hours. In the Great Steel Making campaign, hundreds of thousands of metallurgical workers were also trained, cadres were tempered, the mysterious view of running industry was broken, people's minds were liberated, and rich experience was accumulated. How can it be said that running steel in a big way is "not worth the loss" or "some gains and some losses"? Taking agriculture as another example, although the sown area of ​​wheat and summer crops in Shandong this year has decreased by about 10 million mu compared with last year, due to the advantage of the People's Commune of "large size and high degree of public ownership," cooperation was carried out in all aspects, deep plowing and close planting were implemented, and field management was strengthened. The unit area yield was greatly improved, and the total output was still roughly close to last year's level. Hundreds of millions of mu of spring and summer crops were sown in a timely manner, with reasonable close planting, and generally grew well. Since late July, most areas of Shandong have not had soaking rain for dozens of days, coupled with the hot weather and rapid evaporation of water, resulting in a severe drought that has not been seen in decades. The drought-affected area reached more than 70 million mu (of which more than 30 million mu were severely affected). However, due to the fact that party organizations and cadres at all levels in the province took the lead and mobilized 10 million people to fight the drought, irrigating 18 million mu of land in half a month, the great superiority of the People's Commune in organizing manpower and mutual cooperation in the drought resistance struggle was once again demonstrated. Later, rainfall occurred in most areas of the province, and the current 70 million mu of late autumn crops are growing well, and a good harvest is expected. These vivid facts prove that the General Line and the Great Leap Forward are incomparably correct, and the People's Communes have incomparable superiority. The attacks by domestic and foreign hostile elements and a few right-leaning opportunists within the Party against the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement are completely rumors and slanders, and a reversal of right and wrong. Some right-leaning opportunists oppose large-scale mass movements, which in fact opposes the General Line.

    The meeting believes that the "main danger at present is that right-leaning opportunist thinking is growing in some cadres" as pointed out in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee also applies to Shandong. In the previous period, a few cadres in Shandong also had right-leaning opportunist thoughts that criticized the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune, and running steel in a big way, as well as the right-leaning sentiment that indicators fell again and again, and the lower the better. The meeting believes that this right-leaning thinking and right-leaning sentiment are fundamentally opposed to the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. If it is not thoroughly criticized, it will inevitably affect morale and hinder the vigorous development of socialist construction. At the meeting, some comrades with right-leaning ideas conducted earnest self-criticism and mutual criticism in the spirit of being responsible to the Party and the people's cause.

    After serious discussions, the meeting adjusted the main indicators of Shandong Province's implementation of the national economic plan this year. It was determined that the province's total output this year will be 1.4 million tons of iron, 180,000 tons of steel, 21.5 million tons of coal, and grain and cotton will increase by about 10% on the basis of last year's verified output.

    This meeting was conducted in a way that combined the virtual with the real, combining the inside and outside of the meeting, and acting while discussing. During the meeting, each prefectural, municipal, and county party committee had a leading cadre go back to convey the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and seize the current work. Facts show that once the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee met with the masses, it immediately produced a huge material force. At present, the increase production and practice economy movement has been vigorously launched throughout the province. In terms of industry, according to recent statistics from Jinan, Qingdao, Zibo, Dezhou and other four cities, more than 90% of factories, mines and enterprises have launched a vigorous socialist labor competition, production has risen sharply, and new records have continued to emerge, forming a new leap forward. For example, the average daily output of iron in the province was 3,411 tons in early August, 3,755 tons in mid-August, 4,021 tons in late August, and the average daily output in early September reached 4,913 tons, an increase of 44.03% compared with the same period in August; the average daily output of steel was 550.5 tons in early August, more than 560 tons in mid-August, more than 630 tons in late August; it has reached 743 tons in early September, an increase of 48.45% compared with the same period in August; the daily output of coal in the province was at most more than 59,500 tons before August 26, and it has reached 64,800 tons on September 5. The production of other industrial projects has also greatly improved. In terms of agriculture, the slogan "Oppose Rightism, Boost Enthusiasm, Add Measures, and Ensure a Good Harvest" has resounded throughout the province, and a Great Leap Forward scene of "red flags all over the hills during the day and red lanterns everywhere at night" has appeared in many areas. Various places have revised their indicators and increased their measures, vowing to win a bumper autumn harvest and ensure the timely planting of wheat. Many units have also launched a socialist production competition. Pingyuan County proposed to launch the "Four Studies," "Four Catch-ups," and "Four Surpasses" movement, that is, learning, catching up with, and surpassing Shou Zhang in grain production; learning, catching up with, and surpassing Lin Qing in cotton production; learning, catching up with, and surpassing Gao Tang in county and commune industry; and learning, catching up with, and surpassing Wu Lian in diversified economy. After the meeting, troops were dispatched in four directions to visit and study in four counties.

    On the 11th, after the congress passed the resolution on resolutely implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the first secretary of the provincial party committee, Shu Tong, made a concluding report. In his report, he analyzed in detail the harm of right-leaning thinking and the conditions for completing the various indicators this year, pointed out the problems that should be grasped in further carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, labor competition, and vigorously carrying out technical revolution and technical innovation; and on strengthening late autumn field management, timely planting of wheat, immediately following the autumn harvest and autumn planting, launching a winter production upsurge centered on water, fertilizer, and soil, and the distribution of commune's annual income, he made specific arrangements. Shu Tong finally called on the entire Party in Shandong to thoroughly repudiate Rightism, fully boost enthusiasm, and hold higher the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, count every day, seize every minute and second, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan ahead of schedule, and strive to complete and approach the main indicators of the second five-year plan within this year.

    把右倾反透　把干劲鼓足
    山东省委号召全省人民计时日争分秒阔步前进
    本报讯　在8月24日到9月11日举行的中共山东省委扩大会议上，到会的人举出大量事实，有力地驳斥了国内外敌对分子和党内少数右倾机会主义分子对总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动的攻击，并在会上热烈展开竞赛，决心以实际行动响应党的八届八中全会的号召。
    会议认真传达和讨论了党的八届八中全会的决议。“反右倾，鼓干劲，立即掀起增产节约运动新高潮”，是这次会议的中心议题。
    在小组会和大会发言中，大家举出山东省工农业生产和各项事业大跃进的事实，证明总路线完全正确，人民公社无比优越。以钢铁生产为例，山东完全是白手起家的。去年8月，全省只有八十四立方米的高炉两座，十三立方米的三座（就是这些高炉也是去年夏天兴建的）。经过一年多来的努力，现在全省已有二百五十五立方米的高炉两座，五十五到一百立方米的二十一座，八到二十八立方米的一百二十二座，三立方米的三百四十八座。去年这个时期，临沂市的猪嘴炉炼出二斤土铁，还开了个庆祝大会；今年9月6日全省日产生铁，已突破五千吨大关。去年8月到12月，全省生产生铁五十万五千吨，生产好钢五万三千吨；今年1至8月，又生产生铁八十一万吨，生产钢九万八千吨。全省生铁合格率1至8月份为73％以上，钢的合格率为90％。由于有去年“小土群”的基础，今年小高炉已很快发展成为“小洋群”以至部分“大洋群”。这显然是一个惊人的奇迹。在以钢为纲的方针带动下，去年全省各项工业都有飞跃发展。煤的产量由1957年的六百一十六万吨提高到一千三百七十三万吨；电由七亿度增加到十点九亿度。在大炼钢铁中，还培养了几十万冶炼工人，锻炼了干部，打破了对办工业的神秘观点，解放了人们的思想，积累了丰富的经验。所有这些，怎能说大办钢铁是“得不偿失”或“有失有得”呢？再以农业为例，今年山东小麦和夏收作物播种面积虽比去年减少一千万亩左右，但由于发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，在各方面进行了协作，实行了深耕、密植，加强了田间管理，单位面积产量大为提高，总产量仍大体接近去年水平。一亿几千万亩春、夏播作物播种适时，合理密植，一般生长良好。7月下旬以来，山东大部地区数十天未下透雨，加上天气炎热，水分蒸发过快，发生了数十年来未有过的大旱，受旱面积达七千多万亩（其中严重受旱的有三千多万亩）。但由于全省各级党组织和干部以身作则，发动了一千万人抗旱，半月浇地一千八百万亩，再一次显示了人民公社在抗旱斗争中组织人力、相互协作等方面的巨大优越性。以后，全省大部地区降雨，目前七千多万亩晚秋作物生长良好，丰收有望。这些生动的事实，证明总路线、大跃进是无比正确的，人民公社具有无比的优越性。国内外敌对分子和党内少数右倾机会主义分子对总路线、大跃进和人民公社运动的攻击，完全是造谣污蔑，颠倒黑白；一些右倾机会主义分子反对大搞群众运动，实际上就是反对总路线。
    会议认为，八届八中全会公报所指出的“当前的主要危险是在某些干部中滋长着右倾机会主义的思想”，这一点也同样符合山东的情况。在前一个时期，山东少数干部中也同样存在着非难大跃进、非难人民公社、非难大办钢铁的右倾机会主义思想，以及指标一落再落、越落越低的右倾情绪。会议认为，这种右倾思想、右倾情绪，是和党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线根本对立的。如不彻底批判，势必影响斗志，阻碍社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展。会上，一些有右倾思想的同志，都本着对党和对人民事业负责的精神，进行了认真的自我批评和相互批评。
    会议经过认真讨论，对山东省今年执行国民经济计划的主要指标作了调整。确定今年全省产铁一百四十万吨，钢十八万吨，煤两千一百五十万吨，粮食、棉花全在去年核实产量的基础上增产一成左右。
    这次会议是采取以虚带实、会内会外结合、边议边行动的方式进行的。在会议进行期间，每个地、市、县委，就有一名领导干部回去传达八届八中全会精神，抓紧当前工作。事实表明，党的八届八中全会精神一经和群众见面，便立即产生了巨大的物质力量。目前，全省范围的增产节约运动已经蓬勃展开。工业方面，据济南、青岛、淄博、德州等四个市的最近统计，已有90％以上的厂矿企业单位，开展了轰轰烈烈的社会主义劳动竞赛，生产直线上升，新纪录不断出现，形成了新的跃进局面。例如，全省铁的平均日产量，8月上旬为三千四百一十一吨，中旬三千七百五十五吨，下旬四千零二十一吨，9月上旬平均日产量，则达到四千九百一十三吨，比8月份同期增长44.03％；钢的平均日产量，8月上旬为五百零半吨，中旬五百六十多吨，下旬六百三十多吨；9月上旬已达七百四十三吨，比8月份同期增长48.45％；全省煤的日产量，8月26日以前最高为五万九千五百多吨，9月5日已达六万四千八百吨。其他工业项目的生产，也有很大提高。在农业方面，“反右倾，鼓干劲，加措施，保丰收”的口号已经响遍全省，许多地区又出现了“白天红旗满坡，夜晚红灯遍地”的大跃进景象。各地纷纷修订指标，加大措施，誓夺秋季大丰收和保证适时种足种好小麦。许多单位还互相开展社会主义增产竞赛运动。平原县提出开展“四学”、“四赶”、“四超”运动，即粮食生产学、赶、超寿张；棉花生产学、赶、超临清；县社工业学、赶、超高唐；多种经济学、赶、超五莲。会后即四路出兵，到四个县参观学习。
    11日，大会在通过关于坚决贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的决议的决议以后，由省委第一书记舒同做总结报告。他在报告中详细分析了右倾思想的危害和完成今年各项指标的条件，指出了进一步开展增产节约运动、劳动竞赛以及大搞技术革命和技术革新应掌握的问题；并就加强晚秋田间管理、及时种足种好小麦、紧接秋收秋种之后掀起一个以水、肥、土为中心的冬季生产高潮、公社全年收益分配等工作做了具体部署。舒同最后号召山东全党把右倾反透、把干劲鼓足，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，计时日、争分秒，为提前超额完成今年的跃进计划而奋斗，为在今年内完成和接近完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗。
