In a Commune Hospital

By Our Correspondent Liu Peheng

　　Commune member Cheng Yusheng bent over, hand pressed against his abdomen, and entered the medical room. After diagnosis by the doctor, it was determined that he had acute appendicitis. The medical staff immediately made preparations for the operation. An hour and a half after the operation began, Cheng Yusheng was sleeping peacefully in the ward. Next door to Cheng Yusheng was a young patient with acute nephritis, Song Yingge, who has now gradually recovered and can play on her own. Her mother had only eliminated her worries a few days ago. When she saw the reporter, she said excitedly: "I really have to thank Chairman Mao for setting up such a hospital for us. When we are sick, we can go to the hospital and doctors and nurses will treat us. The night we first came, the child was very ill, and nurse Wang Jinghua stayed up all night taking care of the child.” As the old woman spoke, she sighed again, tears glistening in her eyes. I asked her, "Old woman, why are you sad again!" She continued: "Alas! I am a person in my fifties. I gave birth to seven children, but only this one survived. This child has become a treasure! My first child had the same illness as this child. Before liberation, if a child was sick, you had to go to Nanyuan Town, more than twenty miles away, to find a hospital, but you couldn't be admitted. The child's illness was delayed like that!”
　　This hospital is the commune-run hospital of the Red Star People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing. Its outpatient and inpatient departments are located in two red-brick and tile houses surrounded by willow trees. The surroundings are endless fields, the air is fresh, and it is quiet. Every day, some patients come to the hospital for treatment. There are women holding children and elderly people being helped. The slightly ill patients sitting on the high-backed chairs automatically give up their seats when they see the elderly and children come in. Commune members come to the commune hospital as if they were at home. Doctors who are not on duty also pick up their stethoscopes to diagnose patients when they see patients waiting. Acupuncturists are busy giving patients acupuncture. Nurse Xiao Chen patiently coaxed Wang Dasao's little daughter Fengxia while applying medicine to her foot: "Be good, darling, don't cry when auntie puts on the medicine!" As she spoke, she quickly bandaged the child. This hospital originally had only two nurses and one pharmacist. Nine new nursing staff were trained. These people were all sent from the commune's production brigades. Most of them have a higher elementary school or junior high school education. After studying nursing, pharmacology and other medical knowledge in the commune hospital for a few months, and after a period of internship, they can independently undertake nursing, laboratory and other work. These young people have deeply fallen in love with their noble profession and study diligently. Whenever doctors perform surgery on patients, they put on sterilized gowns, hats, and masks, and stand in the operating room, concentrating on observing and learning. Miss Wang Jinghua is a good nurse. Many patients praised her for her considerate and meticulous care of patients.
　　At a little after ten o'clock in the morning, the hot sun shone on the earth. The doctors took advantage of the few patients in the hospital at this time to visit the commune members' homes. Doctor Zhu Baozhang prepared his bicycle and medicines, and I also rode my bicycle with Doctor Zhu. Along the way, whether it was children playing or old people relaxing in the shade, they all greeted the doctor affectionately. We rode on a narrow, undulating, uneven path. Large chunks of mud threw me off the car several times or knocked the car over beside the crops. However, Doctor Zhu rode very steadily. I praised him for his excellent cycling skills. Du Xiliang, the captain of Yinghai Production Brigade who was traveling with us, said with a smile: "Our hospital doctors have all been trained, no matter what the wind or rain, it is often like this." Then he told me about a night this summer when Doctor Zhu braved the torrential rain and waded through waist-high water to treat his illness. We arrived at Sun Shusen's house, and little Qiuming, who was suffering from dysentery, was sleeping. After the doctor listened to Qiuming's mother's account, he left some medicine before leaving.
　　At present, this people's commune has formed a medical and health care network to ensure the health of its members. In addition to the commune hospital, the six production brigades have health centers (outpatient departments), and each production team also has health stations or medical points. One production brigade, in addition to the eight production teams with health stations, has also trained more than 190 Red Cross health workers, with three Red Cross health workers for every 100 people. The large number of Red Cross health workers trained by each production team has become the basic-level health backbone for carrying out prevention work.
　　The hospitals (outpatient departments) of the commune and production brigades all implement a district work system of contracting for specific areas, and vigorously carry out prevention and medical work. Medical personnel have shown many moving deeds in carrying out prevention and treatment work. During the measles epidemic last winter and this spring, medical staff put forward the slogan "Measles do not leave the door, medicine is delivered to the door," braving the piercing cold wind, and traveled around the countryside day and night for treatment, often working late into the night. Chen, an old woman from Xihongmen Production Brigade, had two grandsons, Shouliang and Erliang, who both contracted measles combined with pneumonia. Their condition was very serious. Their faces turned blue intermittently, and sometimes they gasped for breath. After Dr. Liu Jingtao rushed to their home to rescue them, the children were saved. The old woman was so moved that she didn't know what to say.
　　This commune hospital originally only had internal and external departments. Later, it successively added departments such as otolaryngology, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, acupuncture, etc., as well as operating rooms, laboratories, fluoroscopy rooms, etc. There is also an inpatient department with eighteen beds, which can receive patients who need to be hospitalized at any time. Now, the operating room is equipped with general surgical instruments, as well as a high-pressure sterilizer. Doctors here have performed operations such as hernia, appendicitis, and mastitis. Next to the operating room, the fluoroscopy room is equipped with an X-ray camera, and the laboratory has a 1,500-times microscope and general routine testing equipment.
　　Because Hongxing Commune has established medical institutions, it not only makes it convenient and timely for patients to receive treatment, but also does a good job in prevention work, reduces the incidence of diseases, and effectively promotes the leap forward in production, achieving a double leap forward in the commune's production and health work. This commune has become a health red flag unit in Beijing.

    在一个公社医院里
    本报记者　刘佩珩
    社员程玉生弯着腰，手按着腹部走进医疗室，经医生诊断后确定为急性阑尾炎。医护人员立即作手术前的准备。手术开始的一个半小时后，程玉生安然地睡在病房里了。在程玉生的隔壁，住着患急性肾炎的小病人——宋英阁，现在已经渐渐痊愈，自己能玩耍。她的妈妈在几天前才消除了忧郁，看到记者后，她激动地说：“真得感谢毛主席给咱们办这样的医院，有病到医院里就有大夫护士给治病，刚来那天夜里，孩子病的很严重，护士王静华一夜没睡看护着孩子。”这位老大娘说着又叹了口气，眼眶里闪着泪花。我问她：“老大娘怎么又难过了！”她接着说：“唉！我是五十来岁的人啦，我生了七个，只活这一个，这个孩子成了宝贝罗！头一个大孩子和这孩子得的一样病，解放前孩子有病得上二十多里外的南苑镇才能找到医院，但又不能入院，孩子的病就这样耽误了！”
    这个医院是北京郊区红星人民公社的社办医院。它的门诊部和住院部设在柳槐树环抱着的两座红砖瓦房内。这里周围是一望无边的田野，空气新鲜，又宁静。医院里每天都有一些病人来就医。有抱着孩子的妇女，也有被人搀扶的老人。坐在靠背长椅上的轻微病人，见到老人和小孩进来都自动地让出坐位。社员们到公社医院就像到自己家里一样。不值班的大夫见到有病人等着，也拿起听诊器为病人诊治。针灸大夫忙着给病人扎针。护士小陈一边给王大嫂的小女儿凤霞的脚上药，一边耐心地哄着孩子：“好乖乖，姑姑给上药不哭啊！”说着话，她就敏捷地给孩子包扎好了。这个医院的护理人员，原先只有两个护士，一个司药，新培养九个护理人员，这些人都是公社各生产大队派来的。她们大部是具有高小或初中文化水平，到公社医院后学习几个月的护理学、药物学等医学知识，和经过一个时期的实习，就能独立的担负护理、化验等工作。这些青年人已深深爱上了自己的崇高职业，刻苦钻研学习。每当医生为病人做手术时，他们都穿好消毒衣帽，戴上口罩，站在手术室里，聚精会神地观察学习。王静华姑娘是个好护士，多少病人称赞她对病人体贴和细心护理。
    上午十点多钟的时候，火热的太阳照射着大地，医生们乘着这时医院病人少，到社员家里去访视。医生朱宝章准备自行车和药品，我也骑着车子同朱大夫一起出发。沿路上不论玩耍的小孩或乘凉的老人，都亲热地和大夫打招呼。我们乘车行驶在狭窄的起伏不平的小道上，路上大块泥巴几次把我颠簸到车下，或把车摔倒在庄稼地旁。但是，朱大夫却非常平稳地行驶着。我称赞他骑车技术高明。和我们同行的瀛海生产大队长杜西良笑着说：“我们医院的大夫都锻炼出来了，不论狂风暴雨，经常是这样的。”接着他又给我讲起在今年夏天的一个夜里，朱大夫冒着瓢泼大雨，趟着快过腰的水为他治病的故事。我们到了孙树森的家里，患痢疾的小球明正睡着觉。医生听取了球明妈妈的诉说后，留下了一些药才走开。
    目前，这个人民公社已形成了一个确保社员健康的医疗保健网。除了公社医院外，六个生产大队都设有卫生院（门诊部），各生产小队还有保健站或医疗点。有个生产大队除了八个生产中队设有保健站外，还培养训练了一百九十多个红十字卫生员，每百个人就有三个红十字卫生员。各生产队培养的大批红十字卫生员已成为开展预防工作的基层卫生骨干。
    公社和生产大队的医院（门诊部）都实行地段工作分片包干负责制，大力开展预防和医疗工作。医务人员在开展预防和治疗工作中，表现出很多感人的事迹。正当去冬今春麻疹流行时，医务人员提出“麻疹不出门，医药送上门”的口号，冒着刺人的寒风，日夜在农村里巡回治疗，时常工作到深夜。西红门生产大队的陈老太太的二个小孙子寿亮和二亮，都得了麻疹合并肺炎症，病情很严重，脸一阵阵发青，有时出气急迫，经刘静涛大夫到家中及时抢救，孩子得救了。老奶奶感动得不知说什么才好。
    这个公社医院原来只设有内外两个科，以后就陆续增设了五官科、小儿科、妇产科、针灸科等科和手术室、化验室、透视室等，还设有十八张病床的住院部，随时可以接待急需住院的病人。现在，手术室除备有一般手术器械外，还有高压消毒器。大夫们在这里已作过疝气、阑尾炎、乳腺炎等手术。紧挨着手术室的透视室设有一台X光照像机，化验室有一千五百倍的显微镜和一般常规化验的仪器。
    红星公社由于建立了医疗机构，既使病人治病方便、及时，又做好了预防工作，降低了发病率，也就有效地促进了生产的跃进，取得了全社生产和卫生工作的双跃进。这个公社已成为北京市的卫生红旗单位。
