Sports Knowledge

    Fencing is a very popular sport internationally, especially in countries like the Soviet Union, Hungary, France, and Italy. In the European Middle Ages, fencing was a skill mastered by knights. After years of evolution, fencing methods and rules gradually improved, becoming an interesting means of physical exercise.

    During a match, both sides wear white fencing uniforms and protective gear, including body protectors, chest protectors, masks, and gloves, each holding a steel sword, and enter the designated arena to fight their opponent using thrusting or slashing movements. It is a complex sport that requires athletes to attack and defend in a certain time and space according to a certain fighting posture. It cultivates qualities such as courage, tenacity, wit, and composure.

    Fencing is divided into four types: foil, saber, épée, and bayonet fencing. The latter three are only for men to practice and compete in.

    In foil matches, only thrusts to certain areas are allowed: for men, from the abdomen up to the collarbone; for women, from the waist up to the collarbone (including the back and chest). In saber matches, both thrusting and slashing are allowed, targeting the torso, upper limbs, and head. In épée, the entire body can be thrust except for the back of the head. In bayonet fencing, the athlete holds the bayonet with both hands, and the thrusting area is the same as in foil.

    Each match is timed differently depending on the event, ranging from five minutes, eight minutes, to ten minutes, and specifies the number of hits (slashes) required, from one hit, three hits to four hits.

    During the match, if one side reaches the required number of hits (slashes) before the time is up, they are considered the winner. If the time is up, the side with fewer hits (slashes) against them wins. In foil and saber matches, if the score is tied when time is up, the match is extended until one side hits (slashes) the other first. In épée and bayonet fencing, if the score is tied when time is up, each side loses one match.

    National fencing competitions in China began in 1956, with only twenty-four athletes participating at that time. By the 1958 national fencing competition, there were one hundred and eighty-four athletes from twenty-five cities participating. Fencing is a demonstration sport at this National Games.

    击剑运动
    击剑运动在国际上非常流行，特别在苏联、匈牙利、法国、意大利等国家。在欧洲中世纪，击剑是骑士们掌握的一种技术，后来经过多年的演进，击剑的方法和规则逐渐完善，成了锻炼身体的一项有趣的手段。
    比赛时，双方都穿着白色击剑服和护身，护胸，护面，手套，各持一把钢剑，进入规定的场地上，用刺或劈的动作与自己的对手搏斗。它是一项复杂的运动，需要运动员在一定的时间和空间内按一定的战斗姿势进攻和防守。锻炼人们勇敢、顽强、机智、沉着等品质。
    击剑共分轻剑、花式剑、重剑和枪剑等四种，后三种只许男子参加练习和比赛。
    轻剑比赛时只许刺中部位：男子是从小腹以上到锁骨处；女子为腰部以上到锁骨处（包括背和胸部）。花式剑比赛时可以刺和劈，刺劈部位是躯干、上肢和头部。重剑除后脑以外全身都可以刺。枪剑比赛时，运动员双手持枪，刺的部位同轻剑。
    每场比赛根据不同项目规定五分钟、八分钟到十分钟和规定刺（劈）中的次数从一剑、三剑到四剑不等。
    在比赛中若时间未到，一方已达规定刺（劈）中的次数，即算胜利；如时间已到，以一方被刺（劈）中次数少者为获胜。在轻剑，花式剑比赛中如时间已到，比数相等则延长比赛时间，至一方先刺（劈）中对方一剑者为胜。在重剑、枪剑比赛时若时间已到比数相等，则各败一场。
    我国全国性的击剑比赛是从1956年开始的，那时只有二十四名运动员参加。到1958年全国击剑比赛时已有二十五城市一百八十四名运动员参加。在这次全运会上击剑是一项表演赛项目。
