The mass movement of large-scale steel production has yielded fruitful results in Xinjiang. The region completed its pig iron production target, a 2.9-fold increase over last year, in early September, three months and twenty days ahead of schedule, producing 120,000 tons of pig iron (excluding native-made iron). Currently, steel warriors north and south of the Tianshan Mountains are in high spirits, working with great energy to continue increasing pig iron production and over fulfilling the steelmaking plan.

Prior to August of last year, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region had only one steel plant, the Bayi Steel Plant, with an annual production capacity of 30,000 tons of pig iron and 10,000 tons of steel. In the past, the region's demand for steel and cast iron had to be met by supplies from the interior. Since the launch of the large-scale steel production campaign last year, and after pinpointing locations and layouts, small blast furnaces have sprung up all over the Tianshan Mountains, transforming from a single small steel enterprise to thirty-six. More than fifty small blast furnaces of 28 cubic meters or less have been built and put into production, and more than twenty small blast furnaces of 28 cubic meters are under construction. The total volume of the small blast furnaces that have been put into production is 1,379 cubic meters, more than twenty times the equipment capacity of the same period last year. The pig iron produced in the region in more than eight months of the year is 7,000 tons more than the total pig iron produced by the original Bayi Steel Plant in the seven years since its establishment. Now, the entire Xinjiang's need for cast iron can be completely self-sufficient.

While building small-scale indigenous furnace groups, the Autonomous Region also stepped up the expansion project of Xinjiang's backbone steel enterprise, the Bayi Steel Plant. To date, a 65-cubic-meter blast furnace and a 6-ton converter have been built; fifteen 0.5-ton to 1.5-ton converters are under construction and have been put into production, plus the newly added converters of Bayi Steel Plant, the region's steel production capacity will be more than seven times that of last year.

The mass movement for large-scale steel production has not only made steel flowers bloom all over the Tianshan Mountains, but has also cultivated a large number of industrial and technical talents for Xinjiang and driven the development of the machinery industry. Before last year, many herders and cadres in Xinjiang's Tianshan Mountains had never seen iron ore, let alone ironmaking and steelmaking. After the large-scale steel production campaign last year, the region now has a 100,000-strong steel production army.

Due to the large-scale steel production, the development of Xinjiang's machinery industry has also been promoted, ending the history that Xinjiang could not manufacture metallurgical equipment. In last year's mass ironmaking movement using small-scale indigenous methods, the objective situation prompted the staff of the machinery departments to emancipate their minds and trial-produce metallurgical equipment such as blowers, motors, and hot air pipes that had never been produced before. Through this mass movement with steel as the key link, the technical level of the machinery industry has leapt forward. (Han Wenhui) (Attached picture)

### 新疆大办钢铁结下丰硕果实  提前三个多月完成生铁生产任务

    新疆大办钢铁结下丰硕果实
    提前三个多月完成生铁生产任务
    本报讯　大炼钢铁的群众运动，已在新疆结下丰硕果实。全区已在今年9月上旬提前三个月又二十天，完成了比去年增长二点九倍的生铁生产任务，生产出十二万吨生铁（不包括土铁）。目前，天山南北钢铁战士正意气风发，干劲冲天地为继续增产生铁，超额完成炼钢计划战斗。
    去年8月以前，新疆自治区只有一个年产生铁三万吨、钢一万吨的八一钢铁厂。以往，全区所需的钢材、铸造生铁都要由内地供应。去年大办钢铁以来，经过定点、布局工作，小高炉已经遍布天山南北，由原有的一个小型钢铁企业一跃而为三十六个。建成并投入生产的二十八立方米以下的小高炉已有五十多个，还有二十多个二十八立方米的小高炉正在加紧建设。已投入生产的小高炉总容积达一千三百七十九立方米，比去年同期设备能力增加二十多倍。全年八个多月全区生产的生铁，比原有的八一钢铁厂建厂七年来所生产的生铁总和还要多七千吨。现在，全新疆所需的铸造生铁已完全可以自给。
    在建设小洋群的同时，自治区还抓紧了新疆骨干钢铁企业八一钢铁厂的扩建工程。到目前为止，已建成六十五立方米的高炉和六吨的转炉各一个；正在建设和已经建成投入生产的零点五吨到一点五吨转炉十五座，再加上八一钢厂新增的转炉，全区钢的生产能力将比去年增加七倍之多。
    大炼钢铁的群众运动，不仅使天山南北开遍了钢铁之花，也给新疆培养出大批的工业技术人材，带动了机械工业的发展。去年以前，新疆天山南北的许多牧民和干部都没有见过铁矿，更没有见过炼铁和炼钢。经过去年大办钢铁，目前全区已拥有一支十万人的钢铁生产大军。
    由于大办钢铁，也促进了新疆机械工业的发展，结束了新疆不能制造冶炼设备的历史。在去年大搞小土群的群众炼铁运动中，客观形势促使机械部门职工解放思想，试制从未生产过的鼓风机、电动机、热风管等冶炼设备。经过这一以钢为纲的群众运动，机械工业技术水平飞跃了一步。　（韩文慧）（附图片）
