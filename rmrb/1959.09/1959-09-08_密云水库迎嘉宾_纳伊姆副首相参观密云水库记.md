Miyun Reservoir Welcomes Guests
—A Record of Vice Prime Minister Naim's Visit to Miyun Reservoir
By Our Correspondent Wang Boqing

	A train full of friendship, heading towards Miyun Reservoir from Beijing, faced the clear wind blowing from the Yanshan Mountains after the rain. On this train, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi sat with the distinguished guest from our friendly neighbor, the Kingdom of Afghanistan, Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Naim. They exchanged warm wishes for the friendship between China and Afghanistan, and frequently burst into hearty laughter for the prosperity and progress of both countries. The rhythmic sound of the train wheels seemed to be singing happily for the friendship between the people of China and Afghanistan.

	On the evening of Vice Prime Minister Naim's arrival in Beijing, Premier Zhou Enlai introduced him to the Miyun Reservoir during their meeting. Today—September 7th afternoon, Vice Prime Minister Naim visited this largest comprehensive water conservancy project in North China. In his inscription for the reservoir headquarters, he enthusiastically wrote: "The great speed with which this project was completed clearly demonstrates the unwavering determination of the Chinese people to achieve their magnificent national ideals." He also said that he "personally witnessed a part of the massive construction work being carried out in China here."

	Today was a rare good day, with bright sunshine. When Vice Prime Minister Naim stepped off the train in front of the Baihe Dam of the reservoir, a busy scene of reservoir construction came into view. He appeared very happy and suggested that Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen take off their jackets and climb the dam to look out. On the winding path leading to the top of the dam, Vice Prime Minister Naim listened to the introduction by Wang Xian, the general director of the reservoir, while watching the reservoir builders, nimbly continuing to transport cart after cart of earth and stone to the dam. Vice Prime Minister Naim said with emotion: "Water conservancy is the lifeline of a country's economy!" Premier Zhou also said at the time: "Some of our Asian countries often suffer from either water shortage and drought or excessive water and flooding. Solving water conservancy problems is our common issue." Soon, everyone reached the top of the dam, which was more than forty meters high. Looking far into the reservoir from the top of the dam, one could see the vast expanse of blue water extending all the way to the foot of the majestic Yanshan Mountains. At this time, Vice Prime Minister Naim was extremely happy. He took out his camera and said to Premier Zhou: "Please stand for a moment, I want to take a photo of you with this lake and mountains as the background!" Premier Zhou stood smilingly and invited the Afghan Ambassador to China, Samad, and Vice Premier Chen Yi to take a group photo with him. After Vice Prime Minister Naim took photos from two selected angles, Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen then invited the Vice Prime Minister and other Afghan guests to stand with them, asking the Afghan and Chinese photographers and photojournalists to capture them in the lens. While strolling and talking on the dam, which was one thousand meters long and twenty meters wide, Premier Zhou pointed to a small house on the hilltop to the south and said to the Vice Prime Minister: "I went there in June this year. At that time, we were studying how to build the dam before the flood came, and we were not sure. At that time, the general director of the reservoir construction site gave me an idea, requesting to mobilize the People's Liberation Army to participate in the construction. I thought it was a good idea, so I transferred 10,000 soldiers to them." Premier Zhou added: "This is how the Chinese army helps with construction." Vice Prime Minister Naim also said after listening: "Yes, without such great strength, it would be impossible to complete such a large project." Then, Premier Zhou invited the Vice Prime Minister to take a boat trip. On the boat, the leaders of the two countries, other Afghan guests, Deputy Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, and others sat together, talking and laughing, creating an extraordinary atmosphere of joy. Vice Prime Minister Naim had cordial conversations with Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen; they talked about water conservancy construction in various countries, and also about ancient history. In the middle of the conversation, the Vice Prime Minister sometimes took out his camera to capture the scenery of the lake and mountains, and sometimes went to the bow of the boat, using binoculars to look at the remnants of the Great Wall on the top of the Yanshan Mountains, which were shrouded in clouds. Premier Zhou introduced: "The Great Wall was built by Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor in Chinese history, who unified China for the first time. This was more than 2,000 years ago." When talking about water conservancy construction, Premier Zhou recommended Deputy Mayor Wu Han to tell the Vice Prime Minister the story of Yu the Great's flood control in Chinese legends. The conversations of everyone from time to time caused bursts of happy laughter. The sun cast huge beams of light in the green and blue reservoir, glittering with gold, adding a joyful atmosphere and charming colors to the friendly conversation on the boat.

	The cruise ship continued to move forward smoothly. Vice Prime Minister Naim asked Wang Xian, the general director of the reservoir construction site sitting next to him: "How many reservoirs have you led the construction of in total?" Wang Xian said: "I have participated in leading the construction of two in total." The Vice Prime Minister said to him: "I hope you will lead the construction of more reservoirs in the future." Wang Xian nodded and thanked the Vice Prime Minister for his concern. Wang Xian also introduced to the Vice Prime Minister that Premier Zhou Enlai had visited the reservoir construction site three times, giving the reservoir builders enormous encouragement. On the boat, Premier Zhou also said: "When I came here last year, it was still a plain within dozens of kilometers. Now, several hundred million cubic meters of water have been stored here." He also said: "At first, I advocated completing it in two years, but the builders wanted to store water in one year, and they won in the end. Young people are braver than us. They created the situation, and we had to follow." Premier Zhou pointed to Wang Xian and continued to say to the Vice Prime Minister: "He is leading us, not we are leading him. Of course, we can't rely on him alone. He must also rely on the broad masses. The broad masses demand that the reservoir be built as soon as possible."

	While everyone was talking with great interest, Vice Premier Chen Yi first leaned against the railing to look into the distance, and then began to compose a poem with deep feeling. He had just recited a few lines when the boat suddenly docked. After going ashore, Vice Prime Minister Naim asked Vice Premier Chen Yi how the poem was coming along. On the train returning to Beijing, Vice Premier Chen Yi picked up his pen and wrote a twenty-line four-character poem in one stroke. The poem wrote: "Distinguished guests arrive, sailing together in joy, peace and friendship, watched by the world." When Deputy Mayor Wu Han read the poem to the Vice Prime Minister, Vice Prime Minister Naim applauded happily.

	The train carried laughter, carrying the friendship between the people of China and Afghanistan, speeding forward on the vast North China Plain.

    密云水库迎嘉宾
    ——纳伊姆副首相参观密云水库记	本报记者　汪波清
    迎着雨后燕山吹来的清风，一列满载友谊的火车，由北京驶向密云水库。在这列火车上，周恩来总理、陈毅副总理同我们友好邻邦的贵宾——阿富汗王国副首相兼外交大臣纳伊姆亲王，坐在一起。他们为中阿两国的友谊互道美好的祝愿，并且不时为中阿两国的繁荣、进步发出朗朗笑声。那列车车轮有节奏的响声，也好像在为中阿两国人民的友谊欢快歌唱。
    在纳伊姆副首相到达北京的第一天的晚上，同周恩来总理会见的时候，周恩来总理就向他介绍了密云水库。今天——9月7日下午，纳伊姆副首相就参观了这个华北最大的综合水利工程。他在为水库指挥部的题词中，热情地写道：“完成这一工程的巨大速度，清楚地显示了中国人民要达到宏伟的全民理想的不可动摇的决心。”他并且说他在这里“亲眼看到了在中国进行着的巨大建设工作的一部分。”
    今天真是一个少有的好天气，阳光灿烂。当纳伊姆副首相在水库的白河大坝前走下火车后，一幅繁忙的水库建设景象就映入他的眼帘。他显得十分高兴，就建议周总理和陈毅副总理脱下外衣，登上大坝了望。在通向坝顶的曲折小路上，纳伊姆副首相一边听着水库总指挥王宪的介绍，一边看着水库建设者们，健步如飞地把一车车的土石继续运到坝上。纳伊姆副首相感慨地说道：“水利是一个国家的经济的命脉！”周总理当时也说：“我们亚洲一些国家，常常不是缺水干旱，便是水多成涝，解决水利问题是我们共同的问题。”不一会，四十多米高的大坝就踏到大家的脚下。在坝顶上向库内远望，只见万顷碧波一直延伸到雄威的燕山山脚。这时纳伊姆副首相高兴极了，他拿出照相机，向周总理说：“请你站一站，我要以这湖山为背景，为你拍个照！”周总理笑嘻嘻地站住，并且请在场的阿富汗驻华大使萨马德和陈毅副总理和他一起合影。纳伊姆副首相在选定的两个角度上拍照以后，周总理和陈毅副总理又请副首相和其他阿富汗贵宾和他们站在一起，请阿富汗和中国的摄影师、摄影记者们，把他们摄入镜头。在一千米长、二十米宽的大坝上漫步交谈的时候，周总理指着南面山头上的一座小房子，向副首相说：“今年6月我到那里去过，当时研究要在洪水来到之前，筑好大坝，我们还没有把握。那时候，水库工地总指挥给我出了一个主意，请求调来人民解放军参加建设，我一想很好，就给他们调了一万名战士。”周总理又说：“中国的军队就是这样来帮助搞建设的。”纳伊姆副首相听了也说：“是的，没有这么大的力量，要完成这么大的工程是不可能的。”接着周总理就请副首相乘船游览。在船上，两国的领导人，阿富汗的其他贵宾，北京市副市长吴晗等，围坐在一起，大家又说又笑，欢乐非凡。纳伊姆副首相和周总理、陈毅副总理亲切交谈；他们一会谈到各国的水利建设，一会又谈到远古的历史。副首相在谈话中间，有时拿出照相机把湖光山色摄入镜头，有时走到船首，用望远镜远眺云雾缭绕的燕
  山山顶上长城的遗迹。周总理介绍说：“长城是中国历史上第一个皇帝秦始皇那时开始修建的，是这个皇帝第一次把中国统一起来，这已经是两千多年前的事了。”在谈到水利建设的时候，周总理推荐吴晗副市长向副首相谈了中国传说中的大禹治水的故事。大家的谈话不时引起一阵阵欢快的笑声。太阳在绿里透蓝的水库里投下巨大光柱，金光闪闪，更给船上友谊的谈话增添了欢乐的气氛和迷人的色彩。
    游船继续平稳地向前驰进。纳伊姆副首相问坐在他旁边的水库工地总指挥王宪说：“你一共领导修过几个水库？”王宪说：“一共参加领导修过两个。”副首相对他说：“希望你今后领导修更多的水库。”王宪点头感谢副首相的关怀。王宪还向副首相介绍说，周恩来总理前后一共三次来到水库工地视察，给了水库建设者们十分巨大的鼓舞。在船上，周恩来总理还说：“去年我来时，这里几十公里以内还是个平原，现在这里已经蓄了好几亿立方米水了。”又说：“起先我主张在两年建成，可是建设者们要一年就蓄水，结果还是他们胜利了。年青人比我们勇敢，他们造成了形势，我们只好跟着走。”周总理指着王宪继续向副首相说：“这是他领导我们，不是我们领导他。当然也不能光靠他一个人，他也要依靠广大群众，广大群众是要求尽快把水库修好。”
    在大家谈得兴味正浓的时候，陈毅副总理起先倚栏远眺，随后便深有感触地作起诗来，他刚朗诵了几句，忽然船靠了岸。上岸以后，纳伊姆副首相还问陈毅副总理诗作的怎么样了。在返回北京的火车上，陈毅副总理提笔一挥而成二十句四言诗。诗中写道：“嘉宾?止，泛舟同欢，和平友谊，举世所瞻”当吴晗副市长将诗念给副首相听的时候，纳伊姆副首相高兴得鼓起掌来。
    列车载着欢笑，载着中国和阿富汗人民的友谊，在辽阔的华北平原上，奔驰前进。（附图片）
