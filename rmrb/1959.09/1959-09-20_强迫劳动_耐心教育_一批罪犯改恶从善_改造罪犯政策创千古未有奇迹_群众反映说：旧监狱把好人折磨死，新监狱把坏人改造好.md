Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: Since the founding of the People's Republic of China ten years ago, the people's government has achieved great success in the labor reform of various criminals. Currently, throughout the country, the majority of criminals have been reformed to varying degrees after labor reform; a considerable number of criminals have indeed reformed and turned over a new leaf, transforming from the dregs left over from the old society into laborers of the new society.

This is the transformation of the essence of reactionary elements by the people's regime, and it is the embodiment of great revolutionary humanitarianism. All Chinese and foreign individuals who have witnessed this great change have expressed enthusiastic cheers, praising, "It is easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter ingrained habits!" "This is a great undertaking unprecedented in history!"

In the ten years since the founding of the country, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have resolutely struggled against the remnant counter-revolutionary forces, quite thoroughly purged the remnant counter-revolutionaries, swept away the garbage left over from the old society, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and created an unprecedentedly stable situation in our country's society. In this struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, the public security organs, procuratorial organs, and people's courts at all levels have implemented the policy of combining punishment with leniency and combining labor reform with ideological education for the large number of counter-revolutionary criminals and other criminal offenders arrested according to law. In addition to imposing the death penalty on a small number of criminals who have committed heinous crimes, are heavily in debt with blood, and have aroused great public indignation, the vast majority of the remaining criminals have been subjected to imprisonment and forced labor reform in accordance with the law, or handed over to the people for control, supervision, labor, and production.

Over the past ten years, a large number of criminals who have been sentenced to imprisonment and labor reform in accordance with the law have been released upon completion of their sentences each year. After their release, most of them have been able to abide by the law and actively engage in labor and production. According to typical investigations in some areas, a considerable number of criminals who are still in custody are actively accepting reform and showing significant signs of repentance.

This is an astonishing change, and many moving events have occurred in this change. Many former counter-revolutionary criminals, after being reformed, have exposed counter-revolutionary elements and have been able to wage a resolute struggle against them; many criminals who have long been accustomed to a life of exploitation and parasitism have now developed labor habits, and some have become skilled in labor; many habitual thieves, pickpockets, hooligans, and swindlers are now able to return lost items and care for public property, establishing new moral qualities. In Yiyang County, Henan Province, there was a habitual bandit named Liu Genshang, who used to be a reactionary military officer who extorted and plundered the masses. On the eve of liberation, he gathered more than 20 guns to rob and commit crimes. In 1951, this habitual bandit was captured and sentenced to eight years in prison in accordance with the law and put into labor reform. During his imprisonment, after the patient education and forced labor reform of the labor reform authorities, Liu Genshang gradually realized his crimes and determined to actively reform and start anew. In 1953, when he was working on a construction site, he was able to take the lead in labor and often exceeded the production quota. In March 1954, when he was working on another construction site, he accidentally caused the explosion of two other boxes of explosives while testing electrical detonators for blasting stones. In a very dangerous situation, he bravely took the lead in rescuing eleven injured cadres and getting them out of danger. Because of his selfless rescue deeds and outstanding performance in labor reform, he had been continuously rewarded and had his sentence reduced by one year and three months. He was released early in April 1958 and was given employment by the government to provide him with a way out. Qian Huiwen, a released prisoner from Zhejiang Province, was originally a habitual thief and fraudster. He stole almost everything and repeatedly impersonated others to swindle and deceive people. In 1955, he was discovered by the local public security organs, sentenced to three years in prison in accordance with the law, and put into labor reform. After his release, he worked actively and studied hard, and has been praised and rewarded many times, and has become a new person who returns lost items. Once he picked up 96.8 yuan in cash and automatically handed it over to the public for the owner to retrieve. When people praised him, he said, "I used to commit crimes because I gained without working, how can I build my happiness on the suffering of others now?"

In Ciqikou, Chongqing, during the Kuomintang rule, there was a killing place for secret service agencies - the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" jointly run by US-Chiang agents. In 1949, on the eve of Chongqing's liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries murdered General Yang Hucheng and many patriotic democratic人士 here. In Zhazidong, where these martyrs were killed, - the place where the blood of martyrs was shed, the local public security organs opened a labor reform factory, becoming a crucible for reforming criminals. Over the past ten years, many counter-revolutionary criminals here have not only been reformed politically and ideologically, but have also gradually been transformed into people with labor habits who can support themselves. A former senior Kuomintang secret agent in the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" could not help but feel condemned by his conscience at this change, and said with emotion: "I never thought that the former killing place would now become a factory! I committed many crimes here in the past, which is nothing less than an accusation against me, deepening my repentance for my crimes!"

The work of reforming criminals through labor is part of the entire class struggle and a continuation of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. This is not an easy task, but a long and serious process of struggle. In this struggle, the public security organs at all levels have done a tremendous amount of work in accordance with the Party's policies. On the one hand, they forced all criminals with labor ability to participate in labor reform; at the same time, they carried out extremely full and dedicated ideological education for them, exposing the roots of their crimes and pointing out the prospects for reform; in addition, they also emphasized the implementation of humanitarian treatment for criminals, strictly prohibiting the abuse of criminals in spirit, body, and material life. Through all of this, most of them can gradually turn around and gradually turn to rely on the people and socialism.

In the process of taking these measures, what plays an important role is to carry out education on confessing guilt and obeying the law, political affairs, current events, and socialism on the basis of labor practice, as well as organizing them to visit the rapid development and changes of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in society, inviting people from all walks of life to report to them, and mobilizing their relatives to carry out ideological education for them. After education on confessing guilt and obeying the law, many criminals supplemented their confessions of their crimes and evidence, and exposed materials of counter-revolutionary elements and other criminals, as an expression of their determination to reform, sever political and ideological ties with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. According to statistics from five regions, including Guangxi, from 1951 to 1953, more than 14,000 of the materials confessed and exposed by criminals were found to be true after investigation, more than 2,300 reactionary certificates, more than 6,000 various guns, more than 160,000 rounds of ammunition, and 19 radio stations. A Central Bureau of Statistics secret agent, Liu Junde, once exposed 123 counter-revolutionary elements hidden in society. Cai Yunqi, the murderer who killed the Chinese democratic figures Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, was exposed by Zhang Weishe, a counter-revolutionary criminal in custody.

Many criminals originally held a skeptical or even hostile attitude towards our country's socialist construction cause. After socialist education and on-the-spot visits, they admitted: "The Kuomintang is a destroyer, and the Communist Party is a builder"; "Things that old China has not done in decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years have been done today." In particular, breaking the boundary that completely isolates criminals from society and organizing them to visit society itself moved them so much that they thought, "This is something that has never happened since ancient times," and felt that they could no longer maintain a stubborn attitude. In January 1959, the labor reform authorities of Hubei Province organized criminals to visit the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and the Yangtze River Bridge. A prisoner who had been "crazy" for three years confessed to the cadres the truth about pretending to be crazy and resisting reform after listening to the report conveyed by the criminals who had returned from the visit. Zhang Jinwu, a counter-revolutionary criminal sentenced to life imprisonment in the Second Prison of Hebei Province, had long been worried that his little girl, who was only a few months old, had already passed away. But a few years later, when his cousin led a little girl who was already seven or eight years old to see Zhang, he said to him: "This child is raised by the cooperative and is now in the commune's kindergarten." Zhang looked at the white and fat child, and could not help but shed tears, and said gratefully: "The child is born at home and raised in the community. The Communist Party is really better than parents!"

Due to participating in production labor, many criminals have undergone great changes in their thinking. When criminals' thoughts and feelings about labor change, they gradually change from forced labor to voluntary labor, and from the exploiters and parasites of the past to self-reliant laborers of the new society. According to statistics, in recent years, all those released upon completion of their sentences, with the exception of a few elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, have developed labor habits, and almost 100% have obtained labor employment opportunities.

All of this has been warmly praised and actively supported by the broad masses of the people. The people generally reflect: "Old prisons tortured good people to death, and new prisons transform bad people into good people." They believe that labor reform work is "extremely good" and "done right." An old man in his seventies said with emotion after seeing these situations: "Such a great transformation undertaking that has never happened before can only appear under the leadership of the Communist Party and in a socialist society. I cheer for the achievements of labor reform!"

The families of many prisoners and those who have been released after serving their sentences also sincerely appreciate the people's government's revolutionary humanitarian policy. A family member of a prisoner said, "Chairman Mao's light not only illuminates the road of the working people, but also illuminates the future of criminals' reform"!

Over the past ten years, hundreds and thousands of international friends from more than 50 countries have visited our country's prisons and labor reform teams. Among them are government leaders, party leaders, members of parliament, representatives of industry and commerce, worker representatives, as well as writers, reporters, and scholars. After their visits, they were all amazed and praised our country's policy of reforming criminals through labor. Some said, "This is the most correct and humane way to treat prisoners." Others said, "Under today's new socialist system, punishment has fundamentally changed. It is no longer a harsh and cruel thing, but a means of educating prisoners to be human again."

Thoroughly reforming the criminals who are still in custody is still a very arduous task. The state's coercive organs are continuing to strengthen labor reform work and gradually transform these dregs of the old society into useful laborers. (Attached picture)

### 强迫劳动　耐心教育　一批罪犯改恶从善  改造罪犯政策创千古未有奇迹  群众反映说：旧监狱把好人折磨死，新监狱把坏人改造好

    强迫劳动　耐心教育　一批罪犯改恶从善
    改造罪犯政策创千古未有奇迹
    群众反映说：旧监狱把好人折磨死，新监狱把坏人改造好
    据新华社19日讯　中华人民共和国成立十年以来，人民政府对各种罪犯进行的劳动改造工作，已经取得了伟大的成绩。现在在全国范围内，大多数罪犯经过劳动改造以后，已经得到了不同程度的改造；有相当一批罪犯，确实已经改恶从善，由旧社会遗留下来的渣滓变成了新社会的劳动者。
    这是人民政权对反动分子的本质的改造，是伟大的革命人道主义的体现。所有看到了这种伟大变化的中外人士，无不表示热烈的欢呼，他们赞叹说，“江山犹易改，习性岂难新！”“这是千古未有的伟大事业！”
    建国十年来，中国人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，坚决地同反革命残余势力进行了斗争，相当彻底地肃清了残余反革命分子，扫除了旧社会遗留下来的垃圾，巩固了人民民主专政，创造了我国社会空前未有的安定局面。在这场革命同反革命的斗争中，各地人民公安机关、检察机关和人民法院对于依法逮捕的大批反革命罪犯和其他刑事罪犯，贯彻执行了惩办与宽大相结合、劳动改造与思想教育相结合的政策。除了对少数罪大恶极、血债累累、民愤极大的罪犯依法判处了死刑以外，对于其余大多数罪犯，都实行了依法判处徒刑、强迫劳动改造，或是交人民群众管制、监督劳动生产的办法。
    十年来依法判处徒刑劳动改造的罪犯，已经有很大一部分逐年刑满释放。他们在刑满释放后，多数都能够安分守法，积极劳动生产。目前仍然在押的罪犯，据一些地方的典型的调查，有相当一部分人积极接受改造并有显著悔改表现。
    这是一种惊人的变化，在这一变化中，各地出现了许多动人的事例。许多过去的反革命罪犯，经过改造以后检举揭发了反革命分子，并且能够同反革命分子进行坚决的斗争；许多长期过惯了剥削寄生生活的罪犯，现在养成了劳动习惯，有的并成为劳动中的能手；许多惯盗惯窃、流氓、骗子手，现在能够拾金不昧，爱护公共财产，树立了新的道德品质。河南省宜阳县有一个惯匪柳根尚，过去是个反动军官，敲诈勒索，劫掠群众，在解放前夕还聚枪二十多支抢劫作案。1951年这个惯匪被我捕获依法判刑八年，投入劳动改造。柳根尚在关押期间，经过劳改机关的耐心教育和强迫劳动改造，逐渐认识了自己的罪恶，决心积极改造，重新做人。1953年他在一个工地劳动改造时，能够积极带头劳动，经常超额完成生产定额。1954年3月他在另一个工地劳动改造时，因试用电导爆破石料，不慎引起另外两箱炸药爆炸，情势万分危急，他却奋不顾身地带头抢救出受伤的十一名干部脱险。由于他舍己救人的事迹和在劳动改造中的突出表现，曾经连续得到奖励，减刑一年零三个月，在1958年4月提前释放，并且由政府安置就业，给以生活出路。浙江省有一个刑满释放分子钱惠文，原是一个惯窃诈骗犯。他几乎是一个无物不偷的人，还先后假冒名义，到处招摇撞骗。1955年被当地公安机关查获，依法判刑三年，投入劳动改造。刑满释放以后，他劳动积极，努力学习，曾受过多次表扬和奖励，而且成为一个拾金不昧的新人。有一次他拾到现金九十六元八角，自动交公由失主领回。当人们表扬他时，他说：“我过去是因不劳而获犯罪的，现在怎能再将自己的幸福建筑在别人的痛苦上？”
    重庆市磁器口，在国民党统治时期曾有一个特务机关的杀人场所——美蒋特务合办的“中美合作所”。1949年重庆临解放前夕，国民党反动派曾经在这里杀害了杨虎城将军，以及许多爱国民主人士。就在这些烈士们遇害的渣滓洞，——当年洒满了烈士鲜血的地方，当地人民公安机关开办了劳改工厂，成为改造罪犯的熔炉。十年来，在这里有不少反革命罪犯不仅得到了政治、思想上的改造，而且逐步改变为有劳动习惯、能够自食其力的人。有一个当年在“中美合作所”的国民党高级特务，对这种变化也不得不受到良心的谴责，感慨地说：“想不到过去的杀人场所，如今变成了工厂！我过去在这里犯下了许多罪行，这不啻是在向我控诉，加深我对自己罪恶的忏悔！”
    劳动改造罪犯的工作，是整个阶级斗争的一部分，是革命同反革命斗争的继续。这不是一件轻而易举的事情，而是一个长期的严重的斗争过程。在这场斗争中，各地公安机关依据党的政策，进行了巨大的工作。一方面强迫罪犯中凡是有劳动能力的人一律参加劳动改造；同时对他们进行了极其充分的、用心的思想教育，揭露他们犯罪的根源，向他们指明改造的前途；另外，还强调对罪犯实行人道主义的待遇，严禁在精神上、肉体上和物质生活上虐待罪犯。通过这一切，使他们多数人能够逐渐地回心转意，逐渐地转向投靠人民、投靠社会主义。
    在采取这些措施的过程中，起重大作用的是在劳动实践的基础上向他们进行认罪服法、政治时事和社会主义的教育，以及组织他们到社会上参观社会主义革命和社会主义建设一日千里的发展变化，邀请社会各界人士向他们做报告，动员他们的亲属对他们进行思想教育。不少罪犯经过认罪服法教育以后，补充交代了自己的罪恶、罪证，检举了反革命分子和其他犯罪分子的材料，作为决心改恶从善、斩断与帝国主义和蒋介石反动派政治思想联系的表示。据广西等五个地区1951年至1953年的统计，罪犯中坦白检举出来的材料，经调查属实的即有一万四千多件，反动证件有二千三百多件，各种枪支六千余支，弹药十六万多发，电台十九部。有一个中统特务刘浚德，就曾经检举出隐藏在社会上的一百二十三名反革命分子。杀害我国民主人士李公朴、闻一多的凶手蔡云旗，就是被在押反革命犯张维射检举出来的。
    许多罪犯原来对我国的社会主义建设事业抱着半信半疑，甚至采取敌对的态度。经过社会主义教育和实地参观以后，他们承认：“国民党是破坏者，共产党是建设者”；“旧中国几十年、几百年、甚至几千年都没有办到的事情，今天办到了”。尤其是打破罪犯同社会绝对隔离开来的界限，组织他们到社会上参观这种作法本身，更使他们感动万分，认为：“这是自古以来都没有的事”，感到再也不能坚持顽固态度了。1959年1月，湖北省劳改机关组织了罪犯参观武汉钢铁公司和长江大桥，有一个“疯了”三年的犯人，听了参观回来的犯人传达报告以后，向干部坦白出装疯抗拒改造的真象。河北省第二监狱一个被判处无期徒刑的反革命犯张进武，长时间他一直顾虑家中有个才几个月的小女孩，早已不在人世了。可是几年之后当他的表弟领着一个已经七、八岁的小女孩来看张犯时，对他说：“这个孩子由合作社养起来，现在在公社的幼儿园。”张犯看着这个长得又白又胖的孩子，不禁流下泪来，感激地说：“孩子是家里生，社里养，共产党真是胜过亲爹娘！”
    由于参加生产劳动，许多罪犯的思想发生了很大的变化。当罪犯对于劳动的思想感情产生了变化的时候，他们也就从被迫劳动逐渐变成自愿劳动，从过去的剥削者和寄生虫逐渐变成自食其力的、新社会的劳动者。据统计，几年来所有刑满释放的人，除了少数老弱病残以外，绝大多数都养成了劳动习惯，而且几乎是百分之百的得到了劳动就业的机会。
    所有这一切，都得到了广大人民群众的热烈称赞和积极的支持。人民群众普遍反映：“旧监狱把好人折磨死，新监狱把坏人改造成好人”。他们认为劳动改造工作“好极了”，“搞对了”，有一位七十多岁的老人看到这些情形以后感动地说：“这样千古未有的伟大改造事业，只有在共产党领导下，在社会主义社会内才能出现。我为劳改事业的成绩而欢呼！”
    许多犯人的家属和已刑满释放的人也衷心感激人民政府的革命人道主义的政策。有一个犯人家属说，“毛主席的光芒不仅照亮了劳动人民的道路，也照亮了罪犯的改造前途”！
    十年来，有五十多个国家成百上千的国际友人参观过我国的监狱和劳改队。其中，有政府的领导人，政党的领袖，议会的议员，工商界的代表，工人代表，以及作家、记者、学者名流，他们参观后莫不感到惊奇，称赞我国劳动改造罪犯政策。有的说，“这是极正确的和最人道的对待犯人的方法”。有的说，“在今天新的社会主义制度下，刑罚已根本改变，它不再是严酷残忍的东西，而是教育犯人重新做人的手段”。
    彻底改造目前仍旧在押的罪犯，还是一个十分艰巨的工作。国家的强制机关，正在继续加强劳动改造工作，逐步地把这些旧社会的渣滓，改造成有用的劳动者。（附图片）
