    Revolutionary Mass Movement, Long Live!
    Chen Shouzhong, Secretary of the Baotou Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    The No. 1 blast furnace of Baotou Steel has been completed and produced iron one year ahead of schedule! The iron production of Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace marks a new stage in the construction of the nationally watched Baotou industrial base, marks a leap forward in China's iron and steel industry, and marks a profound change in the economic landscape of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This is a victory for implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction! It is a victory for implementing the Party's ethnic policies! It is also a powerful rebuttal to reactionaries and right-leaning opportunists at home and abroad!
    The early commissioning of Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace is a vivid example of the great leap forward in China's socialist construction. In Baotou, an area with a relatively weak industrial base, the difficulties of carrying out such large-scale modern industrial construction are imaginable. However, with the help of the great Soviet Union, we overcame the difficulties of starting from scratch, conquered the technical barriers of large-scale modern industrial construction, and achieved rapid development in construction. The No. 1 blast furnace project took fifteen months from the start of construction in June last year to its commissioning, but the effective construction period was only twelve months. During this period, we completed the installation of more than 10,000 tons of complex metal structures, 7,400 tons of equipment, and 64 kilometers of various pipelines in the blast furnace construction area alone, built more than 50 kilometers of railways, poured 60,000 cubic meters of concrete, and excavated and filled 1.6 million cubic meters of earthwork, ensuring that the No. 1 blast furnace was put into production with excellent quality. At the same time, we also built the Baiyunebo iron mine with large-scale mechanized mining, the first Yellow River water supply system providing a large amount of industrial water, two coke ovens with an annual output of 400,000 to 500,000 tons of coke (one of which was put into production in May this year, and the other is being baked), and a mechanical general factory responsible for all equipment maintenance and repair. Baotou, a fur distribution center that once suffered from the reactionary rule of the old era, is now striding forward!
    Mass Movement is the Source of Strength
    The practice of Baotou Steel's construction has made us deeply realize that the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is the beacon illuminating all our work. The general line is a concentrated expression of the great determination and great wisdom of China's 600 million people. Under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the general line, a great mass movement for socialist construction will inevitably be launched, and the revolutionary mass movement is the source of our infinite strength. 1958—the first year of large-scale industrial construction of Baotou Steel, in our enterprise, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, broke through the shackles of "large enterprises cannot engage in large-scale mass movements," and launched a magnificent mass movement, which promoted the all-round leap forward of our work and renewed the face of the enterprise. Inspired by the slogan of "completing the eight-year plan in five years," the broad masses accelerated the construction progress, making various projects leap forward again and again, and were completed ahead of schedule. The civil construction workers completed the pouring of the 1,700-plus cubic meter No. 1 blast furnace foundation in only twenty-two and a half hours. The blast furnace installation workers installed the outer shell of the blast furnace body in twenty-six days (twice as fast as the general construction period) and the furnace shells of the three hot blast stoves in just over nine days and nights (more than ten times faster than the planned speed). In order to ensure more, faster, better, and more economical results, employees extensively launched technical revolution and technical innovation activities, and put forward tens of thousands of innovation proposals. Among them, large-scale pressure pouring method in concrete construction, quicksand prevention method in Yellow River construction, etc. are valuable innovations. In order to overcome the difficulties in the supply of equipment and materials, the employees relied on their own efforts to produce a considerable amount of pig iron, steel, cement, coke, calcium carbide, and refractory materials, and made various non-standard equipment themselves. In this way, various difficulties were overcome in less than six months of effective construction period, and the annual capital construction and production plans were overfulfilled. Last year's great leap forward laid the foundation for this year's continued leap forward and guaranteeing early iron production. In the first half of this year, while continuing to mobilize the masses to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, we focused more on enterprise management, creating conditions for a healthier development of the mass movement. Since August, under the call of the Party Central Committee to oppose rightism, boost morale, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, our mass movement has developed unprecedentedly widely and deeply, and a new upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice economy has quickly emerged. The great power of this mass movement has turned the possibility of Baotou Steel producing iron in September into reality, and sternly refuted the right-leaning thoughts and emotions of some cadres. This vigorous mass movement has also profoundly educated the Party and leaders at all levels of Baotou Steel.
  Oppose Rightism, Boost Morale, Adhere to Putting Politics in Command
    The Central Committee's instructions on opposing rightism, boosting morale, and launching a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy profoundly reflect the urgent demands and inner wishes of the people. As long as we resolutely implement the Central Committee's instructions, resolutely criticize right-leaning thoughts, and resolutely trust and mobilize the masses, the mass movement will rise like a raging tide, sweep away the bleak situation, and create a vigorous great leap forward situation. The changes in Baotou Steel in July and August this year are a very vivid proof. Before August, Baotou Steel's construction was generally in a continuous leap forward situation, and the masses had great enthusiasm. However, at that time, some right-leaning thoughts and emotions were growing among a small number of cadres. They lacked confidence in achieving the leap forward targets and ensuring early iron production. They lacked enthusiasm for the mass movement, and even pointed fingers and poured cold water on it. The influence of this wrong thinking caused some ideological confusion among cadres and masses for a short time, and a bleak situation emerged in which many project plans could not be completed on schedule and the enthusiasm of the masses could not be fully utilized. In August, in accordance with the Central Committee's instructions on opposing right-leaning thoughts, the Party Committee analyzed the subjective and objective conditions of Baotou Steel's construction, criticized right-leaning thoughts, put forward the battle call of "going all out, ensuring iron production in September, welcoming the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, and offering gifts to the National Day" to all employees, and immediately mobilized the masses to discuss measures. 80,000 employees gathered to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party Committee, and letters of determination and guarantee conditions emerged like a storm, and a new upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice economy to offer gifts to the National Day quickly emerged. Afterwards, the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pushed the tide of this mass movement to its highest peak!
    Once the masses are mobilized, the competition to strive for advancement and compare with the advanced will be launched enthusiastically on all fronts. Zhao Jinfar, An Chengzhang, and Gao Hanfu, three small teams that built the carbon bricks for the furnace bottom, competed. After the Zhao and An teams got the good news in the competition, Gao Hanfu was so anxious that he shed tears. The next day, their team implemented clever work and improved the labor organization, creating an amazing record of laying a layer of full furnace bottom (a total of ninety-one bricks, each weighing up to nine hundred kilograms, with extremely strict technical requirements). The construction project of all blast furnace refractory bricks was planned to be completed in forty-five days, and the furnace builders completed it in only twenty-eight days on the premise of ensuring quality. Workers who were considered backward in the past changed their usual ways, worked excellently, and entered the ranks of advanced workers. A worker in the Mechanical and Electrical Third Team once said when he saw others working vigorously: "People die for wealth, birds die for food, I won't work more without more money." After the competition started, he said: "I want to offer a gift to the National Day, watch!" He immediately challenged the most advanced workers. In the past, it took him six hours to make a leather belt joint cut, but now he completed it in only forty-five minutes. He was full of sweat after working, but he was happy and joyful. Workers, technicians, and grassroots leading cadres worked day and night to seize the time, and did not leave the front line. They were mobilized not to leave, and could not be driven away. The leading cadres "forced" the workers to go home to rest, but after a turn, they went back to work. Relying on the unparalleled labor enthusiasm and wisdom of the employees, things that people thought could not be done were done. From August 10th to September 25th, in just forty-five days, about 25% of the total project volume of the blast furnace system was completed, which is truly a miracle!
    Leaders Go to the Front Line to Grasp Enterprise Management
    Leading cadres going to the front line, strengthening the leadership of the movement, and strengthening enterprise management are the decisive conditions for ensuring the combination of the mass movement and centralized leadership, and ensuring the healthy development of the mass movement. How to combine the mass movement and centralized leadership was a problem that we had not completely solved in the previous stage of our work. Last year, we made great achievements in carrying out the mass movement, overcoming the shortcomings of only emphasizing administrative orders and neglecting the mass movement. The leg of the mass movement became stronger, but there was a shortcoming that the leg of enterprise management did not keep up accordingly. In the first half of this year, we also made great achievements in adjusting and strengthening enterprise management, but enterprise management was somewhat detached from the mass movement. The practice of this mass movement basically overcame these two one-sidednesses, making the two legs of the mass movement and enterprise management complement each other and achieving good results. At the beginning of this movement, the leading cadres and technicians of the company went to the front line, went deep into the site, and ate, lived, and labored with the workers under the promotion of opposing rightism and boosting morale; especially the managers, factory directors, and Party secretaries of the units that constructed and produced in the blast furnace construction area. The workers said: "The leaders are so determined, we are confident in producing iron in September."
    Leading cadres going deep into the site has great benefits for strengthening enterprise management. First, it strengthens plan management. In the past, we generally grasped monthly and ten-day plans in construction. Now, with the leaders sitting in charge, we adopt a method of combining top-down and bottom-up, grasp daily and hourly plans, issue them day by day, and check them day by day, so that the masses have clear goals every day and every hour, which is convenient for mobilizing the masses and also ensures comprehensive balance. Second, technical management has been strengthened. All units have widely implemented the "three combinations" to compile construction organization designs, "three combinations" to handle technical problems, and "three combinations" to conduct quality inspections. This method of solving technical problems with three combinations greatly accelerated the progress of the project. Again, due to the clear division of labor and responsibility of leaders at all levels, unified command has been strengthened, the phenomenon of no one being responsible has been overcome, and the responsibility system has been greatly strengthened.
    Leave the Difficulties to Yourself and Provide Convenience to Others
    Fully developing the communist style, implementing the "chessboard" policy, and strengthening collaboration and cooperation are also important keys to making the mass movement soundly developed and achieving the greatest economic results. The construction of a modern large-scale blast furnace involves many units in the construction unit. There are more than a dozen units involved in the construction of the blast furnace body alone, with more than 300 types of work. The mines, coking, water sources, power, transportation, and machine repair projects are closely related to it. To ensure early iron production of the blast furnace, it is necessary to have consistent goals, close cooperation, and form an organic combat team to support each other and work together, otherwise it will hinder each other and cause chaos.
    The whole company is a chessboard, daring to sacrifice oneself to support others, and sacrificing the small picture to ensure the big picture is the ideological foundation for doing a good job in collaboration. There is this ideological foundation among the employees. For example, the furnace builders put forward the resounding slogan of "leave the difficulties to yourself and provide convenience to others." Once the leaders advocated it, it immediately received a warm response from the broad masses of cadres and workers. A lively situation of unprecedented cooperation emerged between production units and construction units, between construction units, and between the "front line" and the "logistics."
    Practice has once again proved that as long as we adhere to the glorious banner of the general line and the great leap forward, as long as we adhere to the working method of the mass line of Marxism-Leninism, firmly trust the masses, and resolutely lead the masses to advance, we will be invincible and indestructible. Long live the revolutionary mass movement!

    革命的群众运动万岁
    中共包头钢铁公司委员会书记　陈守中
    包钢一号高炉比原计划提前一年建成出铁了！包钢一号高炉出铁，标志着全国瞩目的包头工业基地进入了一个新的建设阶段，标志着我国钢铁工业的飞跃发展，标志着内蒙古自治区的经济面貌正在发生深刻变化。这是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利！是贯彻执行党的民族政策的胜利！也是对国内外反动派和右倾机会主义分子的一个有力驳斥！
    包钢一号高炉提前投入生产，是我国社会主义建设大跃进的一个鲜明例证。在包头这样一个工业基础比较薄弱的地区，进行这样大规模的现代工业建设，困难是可想而知了。但是我们在伟大的苏联帮助下，战胜了平地起家的困难，攻克了大规模现代工业建设的技术堡垒，使建设事业获得了飞跃发展。一号高炉的工程从去年6月动工到现在投入生产，共花了十五个月的时间，而有效工期不过十二个月。在这个期间，我们仅在高炉施工区便完成了技术复杂的一万多吨金属结构、七千四百多吨设备、六十四公里各类管线的安装任务，修建了五十多公里铁路，浇灌了六万立方米混凝土，挖填了一百六十多万立方米土方，保证了一号高炉以优等质量开炉生产。同时还建成了大规模机械化开采的白云鄂博铁矿山、提供大量工业用水的第一个黄河供水系统、两座年产四、五十万吨焦炭的焦炉（一座已在今年5月投入生产，一座正在烘炉）和担负全部设备维护检修的机械总厂。包头，这个曾经饱受旧时代反动统治摧残的皮毛集散地，现在正在阔步前进！
    群众运动是力量的源泉
    包钢建设的实践，使我们深深地体会到：党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是照耀我们一切工作的灯塔。总路线是我国六亿人民的伟大决心和伟大智慧的集中表现。在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，必然要掀起一个伟大的社会主义建设的群众运动，革命的群众运动就是我们无穷力量的源泉。1958年——包钢大规模工业建设的头一年，在我们的企业里，广大群众在党的领导下，破除迷信，解放思想，冲破了“大企业不能大搞群众运动”的束缚，掀起了波澜壮阔的群众运动，推动了我们的各项工作全面跃进，企业面貌为之一新。广大群众在“八年计划五年完成”的口号鼓舞下，加快施工进度，使各项工程一跃再跃，纷纷提前。土建工人只用了二十二个半小时就完成了数达一千七百多立方米的一号高炉基础浇灌任务。高炉安装工人又以二十六天时间安装起高炉炉体外壳（比一般工期快两倍），以九昼夜多的时间安装起三座热风炉炉壳（比计划速度快十几倍）。为了保证多快好省，职工们广泛展开了技术革命和技术革新活动，提出了数达十几万件的革新建议。其中像混凝土施工中的大型压力浇灌法，黄河施工中的流砂防治法等等都是可贵的创举。为了克服设备材料供应上的困难，职工群众自力更生，生产
  了相当数量的生铁、钢、水泥、焦炭、电石和耐火材料，自制各种非标准设备。就这样，在有效工期不满六个月的时间内排除了种种困难，超额完成了全年基建和生产计划。去年的大跃进，为今年的继续跃进和保证提前出铁奠定了基础。今年上半年，在继续发动群众开展增产节约运动的同时，比较突出的抓了一下企业管理工作，为群众运动更健康地发展创造了条件。8月以来，在党中央关于反右倾，鼓干劲开展增产节约运动的号召下，我们的群众运动发展得空前广泛、空前深入，很快地出现了一个增产节约运动的新高潮。这个群众运动的巨大威力，把包钢9月出铁的可能性变成了现实，严正地驳斥了某些干部的右倾思想和右倾情绪。这个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，也极为深刻地教育了包钢的党和各级领导干部。
  反右倾鼓干劲坚持政治挂帅
    中央关于反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起增产节约运动新高潮的指示，极其深刻地反映了人民群众的迫切要求和内心愿望，只要我们坚决贯彻中央指示，坚决批判右倾思想，坚决信任和发动群众，群众运动就会像大海怒潮一般，汹涌澎湃，勃勃兴起，把冷冷清清的局面一扫而光，出现一个轰轰烈烈大跃进的局面。今年包钢7、8月形势的变化就是十分生动的证明。8月之前，包钢的建设从总的方面来说是继续跃进的形势，群众干劲很大，但是当时在一小部分干部当中滋长着某些右倾思想和右倾情绪，他们对于实现跃进指标，保证提前出铁缺乏信心，他们对于群众运动，缺乏热心，甚至指手划脚，乱泼冷水。这种错误思想的影响所及，在一个短时间内曾引起了干部和群众思想上的某些混乱，出现了不少工程计划不能如期完成，群众积极性得不到充分发挥的冷落局面。8月份，党委会根据中央关于反对右倾思想的指示，分析了包钢建设的主观与客观条件，批判了右倾思想，向全体职工提出了“鼓足干劲，确保9月出铁，迎接建国十周年，向国庆献礼”的战斗号召，并且立即发动群众讨论措施。八万职工纷纷集会，热烈响应党委的号召，决心书和保证条件风起云涌，迅速出现了一个向国庆献礼的增产节约运动新高潮。而后，党的八届八中全会的伟大号召又把这个群众运动的浪潮推向最高峰！
    群众一发动起来，争先进，比先进的竞赛，就在各条战线上热火朝天地开展起来。砌筑炉底碳砖的赵金发、安成章、高汉富三个小队在竞赛中，当赵、安小队在竞赛中得了喜报以后，高汉富急得流出眼泪，第二天他们队实行巧干，改进了劳动组织，创造了满铺炉底砌一层（共九十一块砖，每块重达九百公斤，技术要求极严格）的惊人纪录。全部高炉耐火砖的砌筑工程计划是四十五天完成，筑炉工人们在保证质量的前提下，只用了二十八天便完工了。过去被认为落后的工 人一反往常，干活出色，纷纷进入先进工人的行列。机电三队有一个工人，过去看到别人干活起劲，曾说：“人为财死，鸟为食亡，不多给钱，我不多干”。竞赛搞起来以后，他说：“我要向国庆献礼，看吧！”立即向最先进的工人挑战，过去他做一个皮带胶接切头要六个小时，现在只用四十五分钟就完成了，干下活来满身汗水，却欢欢喜喜，高高兴兴。工人、技术人员和基层领导干部为了夺取时间，夜以继日不下火线，动员不走，赶不下来。领导干部“逼”着工人回家休息，一转弯就又回到工作岗位干活去了。依靠职工群众这种无比的劳动热情和智慧，人们认为做不到的事情做到了。从8月10日到9月25日仅仅四十五天时间，便完成了高炉系统全部工程量的25％左右，这真是个奇迹！
    领导上前线大抓企业管理
    领导干部上前线，加强对运动的领导，加强企业管理，是保证群众运动和集中领导相结合，保证群众运动健康发展的决定条件。群众运动和集中领导怎样结合，这曾是我们前一段工作中没有完全解决的问题。去年，大搞群众运动成绩很大，克服了只强调行政命令忽视群众运动的缺点，群众运动这条腿强壮起来了，而存在着的一个缺点，就是企业管理这条腿没有相应的跟上。今年上半年，我们在调整和加强企业管理工作上也有很大成绩，但企业管理又有些脱离群众运动。这次群众运动的实践，基本上克服了这两种片面性，使群众运动和企业管理这两条腿相辅相成，收到了很好的效果。这次运动一开始，公司的各级领导干部和技术人员，便在反右倾鼓干劲的推动下，走上前线，深入现场，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动；特别是在高炉工区施工、生产的各单位的经理、厂长和党委书记。工人说：“领导决心这么大，9月出铁有把握”。
    领导干部深入现场对加强企业管理有着莫大的好处。首先是加强了计划管理。过去施工中一般是抓月、旬计划，现在领导坐镇，采取自上而下和自下而上相结合的办法，抓日计划、时计划，逐日下达，逐日检查，使群众每日每时都有明确目标，既便于发动群众，也保证了综合平衡。其次是技术管理加强了。各单位都广泛地实行了“三结合”编施工组织设计，“三结合”处理技术问题，“三结合”进行质量检查。这种三结合解决技术问题的作法，大大加快了工程进度。再次，由于各方面领导干部分工明确，层层负责，加强了统一指挥，无人负责的现象克服了，责任制度大大加强了。
    困难留给自己方便送给别人
    充分发扬共产主义风格，贯彻“一盘棋”的方针，加强协作配合，也是使群众运动健全发展，并且取得最大经济效果的重要关键。现代化大型高炉的建设，在施工单位中所涉及的单位是很多的。仅在高炉本体施工的单位便有十几个，工种有三百多，而与其紧密相关的还有矿山、焦化、水源、动力、运输、机修等工程，要保证高炉提前出铁，必须目标一致，紧密协作，形成一个有机的战斗整体，互相支援，协同动作，否则就会互相妨碍，造成混乱。
    全公司一盘棋，勇于牺牲自己支援别人、牺牲小局保证大局，是搞好协作的思想基础。在职工群众中是有这个思想基础的。例如筑炉工人提出了“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的响亮口号，一经领导提倡，立即得到了广大干部和工人群众的热烈响应。在生产单位和施工单位之间、施工单位彼此之间、“前线”与“后勤”之间出现了一个空前大协作的生动局面。
    实践再次证明：只要坚持总路线、大跃进的光荣旗帜，只要坚持马克思列宁主义的群众路线的工作方法，坚定地信任群众，坚决地领导群众前进，我们便会无往不胜，无坚不摧。革命的群众运动万岁！
