    Sichuan Province's Own Pig Iron
    Basically Meets the Province's Steelmaking Needs
    (Our newspaper Chongqing, September 5th dispatch) Currently, Sichuan has fundamentally changed the situation of needing to transport pig iron from other provinces for steelmaking.
    Since the mass campaign to produce steel in Sichuan Province began in August of last year, in just one year, more than 210 new small-scale iron smelting enterprises have been built throughout the province. These small-scale iron smelting bases are scattered all over the province. Comparing the province's pig iron production from January to August of this year with the same period last year, it has increased by more than four times. Currently, over 90% of the pig iron raw materials for all steel plants in the province are supplied by the province itself.
    At the beginning of this year, after the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee promptly put forward the guiding ideology of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end," the iron smelting soldiers of the province conscientiously implemented the policy of combining "small native groups" with "small modern groups," and combining large, medium, and small scales. They seized the time to rectify the furnace groups established during the mass steelmaking campaign last year, dismantling a batch of native blast furnaces with low output and poor quality, and adding a batch of small modern blast furnaces with volumes of 16 to 33 cubic meters. The total volume of modern blast furnaces put into production from January to July of this year alone increased by 55% compared to last year. The proportion of modern iron has increased from less than 40% of the total pig iron production in January of this year to the current 75%. More than 210 small-scale iron smelting enterprises, which have been gradually consolidated and improved in the development of pig iron production, now all have their own mines; some iron smelting plants have also established their own coal washing and coking bases, and some have even established workshops for the production of auxiliary materials and refractory materials, forming some small-scale iron and steel joint bases that are relatively capable of independent production. After the establishment of many small modern iron smelting bases, the advanced iron smelting experience of heavy pressure, full air, and high temperature has been universally promoted, production management has been strengthened, and production has become more normal.
    Various special districts and counties have made rapid progress in improving the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and the quality of pig iron. The qualification rate of pig iron in the province in June increased by 28% compared with the first quarter, and in mid-August it increased by another 4% compared with June.
    In the past, more than 80% of the pig iron for steelmaking in Sichuan Province was supplied by Anshan, Benxi, Daye and other places, and the cost of long-distance transportation was very high; currently, except for a small amount of pig iron transferred from neighboring provinces as a variety adjustment, the province's own pig iron can basically meet the needs of steelmaking.

    四川省自产生铁
    基本满足本省炼钢需要
    本报重庆5日电　目前，四川已经根本改变需要从外省运进生铁炼钢的状况。
    四川省从去年8月全民大办钢铁以来，仅仅一年的时间，全省新建了二百一十多个小型炼铁企业。这些小型炼铁基地星罗棋布，以今年1至8月份全省生铁产量与去年同期比较，增长了四倍多。现在，全省各炼钢厂90％以上的生铁原料，都由本省供应。
    今年年初，中共四川省委及时提出了“一开头就抓紧，自始至终抓紧”的指导思想后，全省炼铁战士认真贯彻“小土群”与“小洋群”结合、大中小结合的方针，抓紧将去年大办钢铁建立的炉群加以整顿，拆掉了一批产量低、质量不好的土高炉，新增了一批十六立方米到三十三立方米的小型洋高炉，仅今年1至7月份新投入生产的洋高炉总容积，即比去年增加55％。洋铁比重已由今年1月份占生铁总产量不到40％，上升为目前的75％。在生铁生产发展中逐步巩固和健全起来的二百一十多个小型炼铁企业，现在全部都有了自己的矿山；其中一部分炼铁厂，还建立了自己的洗煤、焦炭基地，有的还建立起辅助材料和耐火材料生产的车间，形成一部分比较能够独立进行生产的小型钢铁联合基地。许多小洋群炼铁基地建立以后，普遍推广了重压、全风、高温的先进炼铁经验，加强了生产管理，生产更加正常了。
    在提高高炉利用系数和生铁质量方面，各个专、县进步很快。全省生铁合格率6月份比第一季度提高28％，8月中旬又比6月份提高4％。
    四川省过去炼钢80％以上的生铁，都由鞍山、本溪、大冶等地供应，长途转运成本很高；目前，除由邻省调进少数生铁作为品种调剂以外，本省生铁已基本上能满足了炼钢需要。　（平兰）
