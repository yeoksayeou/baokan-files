Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd -- According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today refuting the accusations by the US government and the Laotian authorities that Vietnam sent troops to invade Laos.

The statement said that the United Press International reported on September 1 that the Laotian Foreign Minister, Khamphan Panya, had told the press: We still believe that many battalions of Viet Minh troops are stationed in Laos for psychological and military reasons.

The Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement said that according to foreign news on September 2, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Laotian Army had said that 80% of the troops attacking the Royal Laotian Army stationed in Sam Neua were Vietnamese from North Vietnam or Laotian tribesmen trained by North Vietnam. The statement said that according to a "Voice of America" radio broadcast on September 2, the US State Department also believed that North Vietnamese troops were very likely involved in the war in Laos.

The statement continued, the spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry is instructed to issue the following statement: The above-mentioned remarks made by the US State Department and the Royal Laotian authorities are unfounded fabrications.

As everyone knows, on August 26, 1959, the US government publicly and formally decided to provide Laos with emergency military aid to expand the civil war in Laos, prepare for a new war in Indochina, further deteriorate the situation in Laos, and threaten the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and peace in Southeast Asia. The above-mentioned slanders by the US imperialism and the Royal Laotian authorities against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are nothing more than their hackneyed tricks to deceive the Laotian people and world opinion, with the purpose of creating excuses for US imperialism to deepen its intervention in Laos and covering up the actions of US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government in launching the Laotian civil war. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that it must reiterate that US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from the current serious situation in Laos that they have created.

    越南外交部发表声明
    斥美萨集团贼喊捉贼
    新华社河内3日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天发表声明，驳斥美国政府和老挝当局诬蔑越南出兵进犯老挝。
    声明说，美国合众国际社9月1日报道，老挝王国外交大臣坎番·班雅曾经向报界宣称：我们仍然认为，由于心理和军事上的原因，越盟的许多营的部队驻在老挝。
    外交部发言人的声明说，据9月2日的外国消息，老挝王国军队总司令曾经说，进攻老挝王国军队驻桑怒部队的军队中有80％是来自北越的越南人或受过北越训练的老挝各部落的人。声明说，据“美国之音”电台9月2日报道，美国国务院还认为，北越军队很有可能参加了老挝的战争。
    声明接着说，越南外交部发言人奉命发表声明如下：美国国务院和老挝王国当局所发表的上述言论是毫无根据的?造。
    大家都知道，1959年8月26日，美国政府已经公开和正式决定给予老挝紧急的军事援助，以扩大老挝的内战，为制造印度支那的新战争作准备，使老挝局势进一步恶化，并且威胁越南民主共和国的安全和东南亚的和平。美帝国主义和老挝王国当局对越南民主共和国的上述诬蔑，只不过是它们欺骗老挝人民和世界舆论的陈词滥调而已，其目的在于为美帝国主义加深干涉老挝制造借口以及掩盖美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府发动老挝内战的行动。越南民主共和国政府认为，必须再次声明，美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府必须对它们所制造的老挝当前严重局势所引起的一切后果负完全责任。（附图片）
