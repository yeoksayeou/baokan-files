    A broad river, a great torrent rushes forth, surging and pounding, flowing straight for a thousand miles.

    But within this headlong, surging torrent, near the banks, there are sometimes small, slow currents, even whirlpools.

    Can anyone who sees that small swirling water say that the great river is not rushing forward? Moreover, that small swirling water will eventually be drawn into the great torrent, flowing with the waves!

    巨流篇
    张惟
    宽阔的大江，大水奔流，汹涌澎湃，直泻千里。
    但在这一往直前的奔腾的巨流中，在靠岸的地方，有时也会有细小的缓流，以至出现漩涡。
    谁能看见那一小股打旋的水，就能说大江不是奔涌向前呢？何况，那一小股打旋的水，终于也要卷入巨流中，随波奔流！
