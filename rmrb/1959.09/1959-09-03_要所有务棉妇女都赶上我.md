    I Want All Women Cotton Farmers to Catch Up With Me
    National Cotton Growing Expert Zhang Qiuxiang
    I heard the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the radio, and I was happy from the bottom of my heart. I felt that every word in the communique and resolutions spoke to the hearts of the peasants. As I listened, I couldn't help but think that production is getting stronger year by year, and life is getting better day by day. From mutual aid teams to cooperatives to people's communes, it's like "eating sugar cane upside down"—each section is sweeter than the last.

    The communique and resolutions added immense strength to my whole being. After listening, I immediately discussed with my group members that we should arm our minds with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and work together with the cotton farmers of the whole county to ensure the bolls already formed, strive for more autumn bolls, and strive for a bumper harvest of cotton exceeding our targets. First of all, we must share and introduce our technology without reservation, using the method of "inviting in to learn, and sending out to teach" to help them catch up with me, or surpass me. Now, Liu Shuxia and Wang Yingwa, and others from the Shuangwang team, exchange experiences with us every other day, and I also talk with Gu Shuhui from the Nanliu team about cotton farming techniques. We will strive to let all the women cotton farmers catch up with me like Xue Junxiu, and achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest.

    Our cotton fields must be fed and watered adequately, so that the cotton does not suffer poverty. We will guarantee an increase of three bolls per plant. On the basis of the original planned yield of one thousand catties of ginned cotton per mu, we will increase the yield by another seventy catties of ginned cotton per mu. We’ll do it right away, striking while the iron is hot. On August 27th, we started irrigating, applying fifty catties of chemical fertilizer per mu. We are determined to fight hard in September and support the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee with practical actions.

    要所有务棉妇女都赶上我
    全国植棉能手　张秋香
    我在广播声中听到了中共八届八中全会的公报和决议，打心眼里高兴，觉得公报和决议中的一字一句都说的是农民心里的话。我听着听着，不由得想到如今的生产一年比一年强，生活一天比一天好，从互助组到合作社到人民公社，真像“倒吃甘蔗”，一节更比一节甜。
    公报和决议给我浑身增加了无比的力量。我听完了，马上就和组员们商量了一下，要用八届八中全会的精神武装我们的头脑，和全县的棉农们，共同努力，确保伏桃，多争秋桃，力争棉花超产丰收。首先要毫不保留的交流和介绍我们的技术，用“请进来学，派出去讲”的办法，帮助他（她）们赶上我，或超过我。现在有双王小队的刘淑侠、王英娃等四人隔一天在我们这里交换经验，我又和南刘队谷淑惠等交谈务棉技术。争取让所有的务棉妇女们都像薛俊秀一样的赶上我，达到全面的丰收。
    我们的棉田，要给棉花吃饱喝足，不叫它受穷。保证每株增加三个桃。在原来计划亩产千斤皮棉的基础上，再每亩增产七十斤皮棉。说干就干，趁热打铁，在8月27日当天，我们就开始灌水，每亩施化肥五十斤。我们决心苦战9月，以实际行动拥护八届八中全会的决议。
