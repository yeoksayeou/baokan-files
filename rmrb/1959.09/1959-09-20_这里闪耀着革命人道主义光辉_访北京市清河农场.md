Sitting on the train from Beijing to Shanhaiguan, after passing Tianjin, one soon enters the coastal area of ​​Bohai Bay. Looking out over the vast and boundless saline-alkali wasteland, one sees red alkali weeds and reeds everywhere. Getting off the train at Chadian Station and driving west, the scenery changes, with endless rice fields undulating in the wind. This is the Qinghe Farm in Beijing, which has 200,000 mu of land, and it is also a place where criminals are reformed through labor.

We arrived at the farm headquarters in less than a quarter of an hour by car.

This is a farm that has basically achieved mechanization. The farm is not only engaged in agricultural production, but also in industrial, fishing, animal husbandry, and other sideline production. Those undergoing labor reform on the farm are imprisoned special agents, backbone members of reactionary parties and groups, heads of reactionary secret societies, bandits and despots, thieves, swindlers, hooligans, and other criminals. The farm organizes these criminals to participate in labor production in accordance with the policy of combining punishment with leniency and combining labor reform with ideological education, and carries out ideological reform in the process of labor. In the nearly ten years since the farm was established, nearly 10,000 criminals have been reformed here and become new people.

Walking into the farm, everything aroused people's interest and made them feel novel. When visiting the criminals' dormitory, we saw a large red couplet next to the gate, which read: "Recognize the situation and accelerate ideological reform; Create achievements and welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country." Entering the gate is a square, and the houses around the square are the criminals' dormitories. The rooms are quite clean. In the library in the criminals' residence, there are newly published books, newspapers, and magazines that criminals can borrow freely. On the wall of the library, there is a set of drawings "From Ape to Man" published by the Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture. Many criminals love to read this set of posters. They learn from here the scientific truth that labor creates man. Farm cadres also often explain this science to the criminals to inspire them to fundamentally establish a labor viewpoint, eliminate reactionary ideas, and actively participate in labor.

It is currently the busy farming season, and the criminals' residence presents a lively labor scene. Some are delivering manure to the wheat fields, some are harvesting grain in the fields, and some are weeding and fertilizing in the vegetable gardens. The loudspeaker constantly broadcasts new information about the labor competition, and the wall newspaper also writes new achievements in the labor competition.

In the criminals' residence, a set of serial pictures introducing the transformation of the criminal Li Rongqi is displayed. Li Rongqi was a habitual thief. When he first came here for labor reform, he was afraid of labor. He and another criminal said it was too heavy to carry fifty catties. After several years of labor reform and ideological education, he gradually developed labor habits. During the labor competition, he took the initiative to do more work and heavy work. Now he can carry more than one hundred catties. We found him, and he said: "Labor has reformed me, and the cadres have patiently educated me. Don't I have a conscience? Now, I don't think about anything else, I just want to work hard and become a working person in the future."

On the day of the visit, the criminals who worked in remote areas could not return for lunch, so the kitchen sent lunch to the fields. In the evening, the criminals returned from work to eat dinner, and after a short rest, they studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in groups and conducted debates.

On Saturday night, we went with great interest to visit the entertainment evening organized by the criminals. The first program was the comic dialogue "The Essence Has Not Changed," which satirized a criminal who did not honestly confess his guilt and did not work hard for reform. The second program was the Peking Opera "Ascending to the Heavenly Terrace." The third program was the slide show "Production Briefing No. 3," which reflected the new atmosphere that has emerged after the farm mobilized to increase production and practice economy. Farm cadres said that their recreational activities are quite active.

The farm leadership pays great attention to technical training for criminals. Many criminals knew nothing when they first came to the farm. The farm specially held training classes on agricultural production technical knowledge for them, so that they gradually learned certain production knowledge. The farm also set up a technician in each criminal team to teach criminals agricultural technology. In the criminal team, the "little teacher" system is also promoted, that is, organizing the criminals who have learned well to help those who have just come to learn technology, learning what to do, and the effect is very good. On the farm, the industrial production technology learned by criminals is multifaceted. According to incomplete statistics last year, the entire farm has trained more than 900 various technicians and skilled workers, including: 135 agricultural, animal husbandry, and horticultural technicians, 15 hospital nurses, 36 mechanical and electrical technicians, 107 machinery and repair technicians, 281 civil engineering technicians, 192 blacksmiths, forgers, foundry workers, welders, fitters, and lathe operators, 100 papermaking technicians, 8 chemical glass instrument technicians, 4 carpet weaving technicians, 98 refractory material technicians, and 7 electrolytic technicians. In the farm's attached agricultural machinery factory, we saw Zhang Shu?, a person who had been released from prison and employed, covered in oil, repairing a tractor. He said: I didn't know any production technology in the past. Now I can not only repair it, but also drive it. Thanks to the government for teaching me these technologies, making me a person who can support myself.

Criminals can also learn culture during labor reform. The farm once divided the criminals into classes according to their different educational levels and organized them to study. Most of the cultural teachers are selected from the criminals. Criminals who previously did not know a single character can now generally recognize 800 to 1,000 characters. Those who had read one or two years of books have all improved to the level of higher primary school education. The counter-revolutionary criminal Liu Xiting had only studied for two years, but now he is in higher primary school, can read newspapers and write letters, read novels, and has also learned abacus calculation. He is now working in the vegetable group doing accounting work while working.

The many tasks done by Qinghe Farm correctly implement the Party's labor reform policy of transforming criminals into new people. Most of the people who have been released from prison on the farm are employed on the farm according to their wishes. With the help of the farm, many people who have been released from prison and employed have brought their wives and children to settle down, and some people who have been released from prison and employed have married and established new families on the farm.

In the Construction Village of the farm, where farm cadres and people who have been released from prison and employed live, we entered a household. The hostess, Sun Guimin, was cooking outside the house. When she saw us coming, she hurriedly tidied up the things on the kang and asked us to take a rest. She was introduced by others and married her husband, Gu Yunzhou, on the farm, and has a child. Gu Yunzhou is a person who has been released from prison. After his release, he worked as a foundry worker on the farm. Sun Guimin is very satisfied with her husband, saying that her husband can work and has skills. While she was talking to us, she was busy cooking with a smile on her face. Entering the home of Yuan Desheng, a fertilizer worker in the horticulture team that manages the vineyard, we saw two colored production certificates of merit of Yuan Desheng and his son pasted on the whitewashed wall, as well as a photo of a girl, who is his son's fiancée. Yuan Desheng often wins awards in the horticulture team for his good performance in labor. His wife said: "It wasn't like this in the past. He smoked opium for more than ten years and white powder for more than a year. The family property was sold out, and no one could control him. My child and I could only rely on the support of my grandmother. After liberation, the government disciplined him well and helped us settle down on the farm. We are really grateful to the government." They have a son, who is twenty years old this year, driving a cart in the horticulture team, and two daughters who are in elementary school. Yuan Desheng's wife talked about these things, and she said happily: If it weren't for the Communist Party, our family would not know what Yuan Desheng would have done to us. Now we have food and clothing, and the eldest son will soon be getting married. I really never thought there would be such good days today.

One evening, hearing that a pair of people who had been released from prison and employed by the farm's cultural and educational team were holding a wedding ceremony, we happily went to join in the fun. We heard the sound of gongs and drums and laughter from afar. Walking closer to the room, we saw a large red "?" character on the front wall, as well as many couplets, and the table was full of gifts. The people attending the wedding filled the room. It was really festive. During the wedding ceremony, someone introduced that the woman was a thief before liberation, and the man was a special agent. After serving their sentences, they both stayed on the farm to work. The man works as a driver, and the woman works in a printing factory. After a period of understanding, they developed feelings and got married today. This is a meaningful wedding. A person who has been released from prison and employed was very touched by this and wrote a poem to express his feelings. The poem reads:

Recalling ten years ago, drifting like catkins,
Once you regret losing your footing, you fall into the abyss.
Great is the Communist Party, saving people like rescuing the drowning,
May you always move forward and live up to the Party's expectations.

All of this made us feel very novel. When you think that a few years or ten years ago, they were still criminals who committed evil and could only spend their springs and autumns in the dark, and today they are acquiring or have already acquired the qualifications and rights to be human, you cannot help but be stirred up by inner joy—the great Communist Party, this is the great revolutionary humanitarian light shining from the Party.

    这里闪耀着革命人道主义光辉
    ——访北京市清河农场
    新华社记者　王濯非
    坐上由北京到山海关的火车，经过天津以后，不久就进入渤海湾沿岸。广阔无垠的盐碱荒地，一眼望去，红蒿遍地，芦苇丛生。到茶淀站下火车，再乘汽车向西行，景象就不同了，一望无际的稻子随风起伏。这儿就是北京市的拥有二十万亩土地的清河农场，也是对罪犯实行劳动改造的地方。
    乘汽车不到一刻钟，我们便到了农场的场部。
    这是一个基本实现了机械化的农场，农场里不仅从事农业生产，还有工业、渔业、畜牧业和其他副业生产。在农场劳动改造的是在押的特务分子、反动党团骨干分子、反动会道门的头子、土匪和恶霸、窃盗、骗子和流氓分子等各种罪犯。农场对这些犯人，根据惩办与宽大相结合、劳动改造与思想教育相结合的政策，组织犯人参加劳动生产，在劳动过程中进行思想改造。建场近十年来，已经有近万名犯人在这里经过改造成为新人。
    走进农场，它的一切都引起了人们的兴趣，使人们感到新奇。在参观犯人宿舍时，到了大门口，看见门旁有一大幅红色对联，上面写着：“认清形势，加速思想改造；创造成绩，迎接建国十年”。进入大门有一个广场，广场四周的房屋就是犯人的宿舍，室内相当整洁。在犯人住地的图书馆里，有新出的书报和杂志，犯人可以自由借阅。在图书馆的墙上，挂着一套由文化部科学普及局出版的从猿到人的画图。许多犯人很爱看这套挂图，他们从这里了解到劳动创造人的科学道理。农场干部也经常向犯人讲解这门科学，启发犯人从根本上树立劳动观点，清除反动思想，积极参加劳动。
    目前是农忙季节，犯人住地呈现出一片热烈的劳动景象。有的往麦田里送粪，有的在田野里收谷子，有的在菜园里锄草施肥。广播筒里不断传来劳动竞赛中的新消息，壁报上也写着劳动竞赛的新成绩。
    在犯人的住地，陈列了一组介绍犯人李荣起转变的连环画。李荣起是个惯窃，刚到这里劳动改造时，他惧怕劳动，和另一个犯人抬五十斤重的东西还说太重。经过几年的劳动改造和思想教育，他逐步养成了劳动习惯，在劳动竞赛时，主动地多干活，挑重活做，现在可以挑到一百多斤。我们找到了他，他说：“劳动改造了我，干部苦口婆心地教育了我，我难道没有良心吗？现在，我不想别的，只想好好劳动，将来做一个劳动的人。”
    参观的这天中午，到远地劳动的犯人不能回来吃饭，厨房里就把午饭送到田里去。傍晚，犯人收工回来吃晚饭，饭后休息一会，即以小组为单位学习党的八届八中全会的文件，还进行了辩论。
    星期六的晚上，我们怀着很大的兴趣去参观了犯人组织的文娱晚会。第一个节目是相声“本质未变”，讽刺一个不老老实实认罪、不好好劳动改造的犯人。第二个节目是京剧“上天台”。第三个节目是幻灯“生产简报第三号”，反映了在农场动员增产节约以后所出现的新气象。农场干部说，他们的文娱活动是相当活跃的。
    农场领导方面非常注意对犯人进行技术训练。许多犯人初到农场时，什么也不会。场里特为他们举办了农田生产技术知识讲习班，使他们逐渐学到一定的生产知识。农场还在每个犯人中队里设一个技术员，教犯人学习农业技术。在犯人中队里，还推行小先生制，即把学得好的犯人组织起来，帮助那些刚来的犯人学技术，做什么学什么，效果很好。在农场里，犯人学到的工业生产技术是多方面的。据去年不完全的统计，全农场已培养出各种技术人员和技工九百多名，其中有：农业、畜牧业和园艺方面的技术人员一百三十五名，医院护理人员十五名，机电技工三十六名，机械、修配技工一百零七名，土木建筑技工二百八十一名，铁工、锻工、铸工、焊工、钳工、车工共一百九十二名，造纸技工一百名，化学玻璃仪器技工八名，织地毯的技工四名，耐火器材技工九十八名，电解技工七名。在农场附设的农机厂里，我们看到一个刑满就业人员张述?，他满身油腻，正在修理拖拉机，他说：我过去什么生产技术也不会，现在不仅会修，还会驾驶，多亏政府教我这些技术，使我成为一个能够自食其力的人。
    犯人在劳改期间，还可以学到文化。农场曾经根据犯人各种不同的文化程度，分成班次，组织起来学习。文化教员大多是在犯人中挑选出来的。以前一字不识的犯人，现在一般都能认识八百字到一千字，原来读过一两年书的，都提高到高小文化程度。反革命犯刘锡庭，原来只读过两年书，现在上高小了，能读报写信，看小说，还学会了珠算。他现在一面劳动，一面做蔬菜组的记账工作。
    清河农场所做的这许多工作，正确地贯彻了党的把犯人改造成为新人的劳改政策。农场里刑满释放的人，绝大部分都根据他们的意愿，留在农场就业。很多刑满就业人员在农场的帮助下，把老婆、小孩接来安了家，还有一些刑满就业人员在农场结了婚，建立起新家庭。
    在农场的建设村，这里住的是农场干部和刑满释放就业的人，我们走进一户人家，女主人孙桂敏在屋外烧饭，见我们来了，连忙收拾炕上的东西，让我们歇歇。她是经过别人介绍和她丈夫古云洲在农场结婚的，有了一个小孩。古云洲是一个刑满释放的人，释放后在农场做铸工，孙桂敏对她的丈夫很满意，说她丈夫能劳动，有技术。她一面和我们谈话，一面笑盈盈地忙着做饭菜。走进管理葡萄园的园艺队积肥工袁德胜的家庭，只见粉白的墙上贴着袁德胜和他儿子的两张彩色生产奖状，还有一张姑娘的照片，这是他儿子的未婚妻。袁德胜在园艺队因劳动表现好，常常得奖。他妻子说：“过去可不是这样，他吃过十多年鸦片烟和一年多白面。家里的财产被卖光了，什么人也管不好他。我和小孩只有依靠外婆的接济过活。解放后，政府把他管教好了，又帮助我们在农场安了家，真是感谢政府。”他们家有一个儿子，今年二十岁，在园艺队赶大车，还有两个女儿，在上小学。袁德胜的老婆谈到这些事情，她高兴地说：要不是共产党，我们一家人也不知会被袁德胜弄成什么样子。现在有吃有穿，大儿子也快办喜事了，真是从来没有想到会有今天的好日子。
    一天晚上，听说农场文教队有一对刑满就业人员举行结婚典礼，我们高兴地去看热闹。老远就听到锣鼓声和欢笑声。走近室内一看，正面墙上有个大红“?”字，还有很多对联，桌上摆满了礼物，参加婚礼的人挤满了一屋，真是喜气洋洋。在举行婚礼时，有人介绍说：女方解放前是小偷，男方是特务，刑满后又都留场就业，男方做司机，女方在印刷厂做工，他们经过一段时期的了解，有了感情，在今天结婚。这是一个有意义的婚礼。有一个刑满就业人员，对这件事很有感触，写了一首诗，表达自己的感情。诗中写道：
    回忆十年前，辗转如飞絮，
    一朝悔失足，堕入深渊里。
    大哉共产党，救人如拯溺，
    愿尔永前进，无负党所期。
    所有这一切，都使我们感到非常新奇，当你想到几年或者十几年以前，他们还是一些制造罪恶的凶手，只能在黑夜里度过春秋的人，而今天正在或者已经取得了做人的资格和权利的时候，你不能不激起内心的喜悦——伟大的共产党，这是党闪耀出的伟大的革命人道主义的光辉。
