Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: The 200,000 builders of the Miyun Reservoir held a meeting on the construction site today to celebrate the reservoir's successful flood control.

The celebration meeting began at 1:00 PM. After Wang Xian, the general commander of the Miyun Reservoir construction, delivered the opening speech, Tan Zhenlin, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.

Tan Zhenlin said that the successful flood control of the Miyun Reservoir guarantees the safety of the vast people in the lower reaches of the Chaobai River. This is a great joy for the people of Hebei and Beijing, and a great joy for the people of the whole country. The reservoir builders have worked hard day and night, racing against the flood, and subdued the raging flood in one year. This is a great contribution you have made to the people.

Tan Zhenlin said: This victory is the victory of the Party's leadership, and also the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. Without the general line and the people's communes, no one would dare to think of calling the Miyun Reservoir to control floods within a year. The Guanting Reservoir, which was talked about for twenty years before liberation but was not built, was completed in only two years and eight months after liberation. The Guanting Reservoir dam has only one million cubic meters of earthwork. After the general line was proposed, the people of Beijing built the Ming Tombs Reservoir and the Huairou Reservoir in one winter and one spring. The amount of earthwork for each dam is larger than that of Guanting. From last autumn to now, the people of Hebei and Beijing have completed the flood control tasks of six large dams in one year. Each dam is ten times larger than Guanting, and the Miyun Reservoir is the largest, more than twenty times larger than Guanting. In the past, such a large dam would take at least five years to build, but now we started construction last year, control floods this year, and will complete construction next year.

Tan Zhenlin said: Now the reactionaries at home and abroad are attacking our general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. Some right-leaning opportunists are also spreading rumors and attacks. They say that it is not right to build water conservancy on a large scale, and that too much water conservancy has been built. Now we answer them that if water conservancy had not been built so much and so quickly last year, there would have been a major disaster this year.

Tan Zhenlin finally said that we must continue to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost our energy. Therefore, we must shout: Long live the general line! Long live the Great Leap Forward! Long live the people's communes!

Li Baohua, Vice Minister of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, Wan Li, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Guo Fang, representative of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Zhengguang, representative of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, and Gao Yi, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Tsinghua University, also spoke at the meeting. They all congratulated the builders on the great victory of the reservoir's flood control, pointing out that this is a victory of the general line, a sign of continued leap forward by the people of the capital and Hebei, and a concrete manifestation of the great superiority of the people's communes. They also encouraged the reservoir builders to continue to boost their energy and strive to complete the construction of the reservoir as soon as possible.

Soviet water conservancy expert Zhurimanov also spoke at the meeting.

Representatives of the civilian laborers and military laborers stated at the meeting that they would resolutely respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions, resolutely oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost their energy, and ensure that all projects are built quickly, well, and economically.

Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, and Zhao Fan, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also attended the celebration meeting.

The celebration activities, which began yesterday afternoon, reached a climax this afternoon. At night, tens of thousands of lights on the construction site illuminated the vast floodwaters of the reservoir, making it exceptionally bright. The construction site was filled with singing and dancing, and twenty-five troupes from Beijing and other places performed wonderful programs for the 250,000 reservoir builders.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: The Miyun Reservoir, one of the national large-scale comprehensive water conservancy projects, has successfully controlled floods. Now the reservoir is full of blue waves, and some of the original mountain peaks have become a few isolated islands in the vast reservoir sea. The torrential flood is slowly flowing eastward from the tunnels and corridors arranged by the people.

This large reservoir, which can store 4.1 billion cubic meters of water, has controlled and stored more than 856 million cubic meters of floodwater this year. During the heavy rain in early August, the flood peak of 3,100 cubic meters per second from the upper reaches was reduced to only 400 cubic meters per second after being controlled and stored by the reservoir, saving about 4 million mu of farmland in the lower reaches from flood disasters and saving a lot of labor for the people along the coast during the flood season.

This reservoir project is very large. Under normal circumstances, it would take one or two years to prepare and four or five years to construct. However, under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the 200,000 builders of the reservoir took only one year to achieve the victory of flood control. Now, 25.28 million cubic meters of earth, rock, and sand have been completed, accounting for about 70% of the total project volume. The two main dams of the Baihe Dam and the Chaohe Dam, as well as the other seventeen auxiliary dams, have all reached or exceeded the flood control elevation one after another. The Chaohe Tunnel was completed and discharged water at the end of last year. The Baihe Tunnel is undergoing concrete lining, and the spillway has also been excavated to the temporary flood discharge elevation. The remaining workload is about 30%. After the reservoir project is completed, in addition to eliminating the flood disasters in the downstream counties and districts of Miyun, Huairou, Shunyi, Tongzhou, Baodi, Jixian, Wuqing, and Hangu, it can also irrigate 4 million mu of farmland and generate 110 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. It is also of great significance for solving the industrial water use problems of Beijing and Tianjin.

The Miyun Reservoir is located in Miyun County in the northeast of the capital, spanning the Chao and Bai rivers. The Chao and Bai rivers originate in the Chengde and Zhangjiakou areas of the Yanshan Mountains and flow through the Beijing-Tianjin area into the Bohai Sea. The upper reaches of the river are high and the water is rapid, and the lower reaches of the river channel are narrow. An area of about 4,000 square kilometers in the Beijing-Tianjin area is often subjected to floods during the flood season. In 1949, 6 million mu of land were flooded and the affected population reached more than 1 million. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people on both sides of the Chaobai River carried out a tenacious struggle against the flood disaster and vigorously strengthened the dikes and flood prevention every year. Last year, encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the Party and the government decided to eradicate the flood disaster of the Chaobai River in advance. The hub project for the treatment of the Chao and Bai rivers—the Miyun Reservoir—started construction on this day last year.

This reservoir was built jointly by Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality under the specific guidance of the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power. More than 190,000 commune members from 180 people's communes in 21 counties and districts of Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, as well as more than 10,000 officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who subsequently participated in the construction before the flood season, displayed a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm during the construction process. Electricians braved wind and snow to erect power lines in the high air. Railway workers rushed to repair the railway day and night as the project progressed. Some civilian laborers were suspended on cliffs as high as more than 50 meters, cutting slopes and chiseling ridges in the cold northwest wind. In May, when the flood season was approaching, a competition movement to rush to work and control floods was launched on the construction site. The construction troops from all directions raced against time, not giving up an inch of land, chasing each other. The Baihe 02 train line created a record of transporting 27,000 cubic meters of materials per day. The efficiency of dam body filling continued to increase. From an average of more than 22,900 cubic meters per day in October last year, it gradually increased to an average of 75,979 cubic meters per day in May this year. After entering the flood season, continuous rain and floods forced the start of a tense battle to rush to work and control floods. All workers, civilian laborers, military laborers, and cadres launched three "campaigns" to rush to repair the clay inclined walls. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army created the highest national record of manual ramming of 9.925 meters per day. The employees of the Baihe construction site repair shop created the "fast installation belt conveyor method," installing one belt conveyor every half hour, increasing efficiency by more than four times. During a rainstorm, the Xiaobei River coffer dam breached, and the construction site upstream of the Baihe Dam was seriously threatened. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the civilian laborers of the Wuqing Detachment were not afraid of danger and jumped into the rapids to carry out emergency repairs. At the end of July, the water level in the Chaohe Reservoir rose sharply. The builders shouted the slogan "The water rises one inch, the slope rises one foot," rushing to build the slope protection day and night, running ahead of the flood. After several rainstorms in early August, the water level in the Baihe Reservoir rose sharply. In order to ensure the safety of the dam, the civilian laborers and military laborers insisted on working continuously for more than 20 hours in the construction of the flood discharge channel, and some military laborers fought continuously for 36 hours without leaving the construction site. On the construction site, wherever there was difficulty, there were officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. In the booming labor competition, more than 4,800 advanced collectives and 148,000 advanced producers emerged one after another. Among these heroic figures, more than 2,000 joined the Communist Party of China on the construction site.

The technical innovation movement carried out on the construction site played a great role in the rapid progress of the project. Each detachment has its own factory. Cadres and the masses broke superstitions and boldly innovated. The number of new tools that were successfully trial-produced and put into production within two months reached 123. In the case where a large number of belt conveyors had not yet been transported to the construction site, the civilian laborers created a rope-drawn machine, and the deputy political commissar of the Baodi Detachment created a five-pulley traction machine. These "native machines" increased the efficiency of going up the dam by five to ten times compared to pushing carts. After adopting the "hopper tilting" method for loading trucks, it only took one to two minutes to load a truck, increasing the efficiency by ten times. The adoption of "multi-mouth scattering platform" and "funnel type" scattering methods for belt conveyors greatly improved efficiency. When a large number of machines arrived at the construction site, the construction site encountered the difficulty of not having skilled workers. The builders insisted on self-reliance, adopted the method of learning while working and working while learning, broke with convention, and used short-term training methods to train more than 7,000 tractor drivers, truck drivers, belt conveyor and hydropower technicians, etc. from the civilian laborers.

The people from all over the country gave great support to the construction of the reservoir. More than 5,000 workers, cadres, and technicians came from 390 factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools, including more than 2,400 skilled workers from 140 construction positions. The broad masses of people in Fujian Province concentrated and transported 200,000 grass bags to the construction site in four days and nights.

The people's commune movement played a particularly important role in the construction of the reservoir. Many of the civilian laborers were not directly benefiting areas. However, after communization, the farmers broke with the traditional concept of only taking care of their own hometowns and villages, and carried forward the spirit of communist collaboration. They carried a large number of handcarts, wood, and tools, and fought side by side with the civilian laborers in the benefiting areas. The communes regularly recorded labor points for the commune members participating in the reservoir construction, uniformly solved some special difficulties in the lives of the civilian laborers' families, and also often organized comfort groups to visit the construction site, introduce the production and living conditions of their hometowns, and encourage the enthusiasm of the civilian laborers. The strong support of the people in their hometowns to the reservoir construction site in terms of politics, manpower, and materials fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, which combine workers, peasants, commerce, education, and soldiers, and integrate government and commune.

In accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party Committee of the construction site is now further strengthening political and ideological work, boosting energy, striving for the upstream, and based on the victory of flood control, fighting a major battle in September, determined to create new achievements and welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    首都东北出现一个大人造海
    密云水库胜利拦洪水库大坝比官厅
    水库大二十倍，可蓄水四十一亿立方，工程总量已完成70％
    二十万建设者盛大集会欢呼只用一年时间就治服了汹涌洪水
    新华社1日讯　密云水库的二十万建设者，今天在工地开会欢庆水库的胜利拦洪。
    庆祝大会在下午一时开始。密云水库修建总指挥王宪致开幕词后，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理谭震林代表中共中央和国务院在会上讲了话。
    谭震林说，密云水库胜利拦洪，保证了潮白河下游广大人民的安全，这是河北和北京人民的大喜事，也是全国人民的大喜事。水库建设者们日日夜夜艰苦劳动和洪水赛跑，用一年的时间就治服了汹涌的洪水，这是你们给人民立下的伟大功劳。
    谭震林说：这个胜利是党的领导的胜利，也是党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社化的胜利。没有总路线和人民公社，谁都不敢想在一年内叫密云水库拦洪。解放前叫嚷了二十年没有修成的官厅水库，解放后只有两年零8个月就修成了。官厅水库大坝只有一百万土方。总路线提出后，一冬一春，北京人民就修成了十三陵水库和怀柔水库，每个坝的土方量都比官厅的大。从去秋到现在，河北和北京人民一年内叫六个大坝完成栏洪任务，每个大坝就比官厅大十倍，其中密云水库最大，比官厅大二十倍以上。过去这样的大坝最少修五年，但现在我们去年动工，今年栏洪，明年就建成。
    谭震林说：现在国内外的反动派在攻击我们的总路线、大跃进、人民公社。一些右倾机会主义分子也在那里进行造谣攻击，他们说，大办水利不对，水利修得多了，现在我们答复他们，如果去年水利不是办得多，办得快，今年就要闹大灾。
    谭震林最后说，我们要继续反右倾，鼓干劲。因此我们一定要喊：总路线万岁！大跃进万岁！人民公社万岁！
    水利电力部副部长李葆华、中共北京市委书记处书记、北京市副市长万里、中共河北省委代表郭芳、解放军驻京部队代表张正光、清华大学党委副书记高毅等也先后在会上讲了话。他们一致向建设者们祝贺水库拦洪的伟大胜利，指出这是总路线的胜利，是首都和河北人民继续跃进的标志，是人民公社巨大优越性的具体表现。他们并勉励水库建设者继续鼓足干劲，为早日全部完成水库建设工程而奋斗。
    苏联水利专家朱里曼诺夫也在会上讲了话。
    民工和军工代表在会上表示，要坚决以实际行动，响应党的八届八中全会的号召，坚决反右倾，鼓干劲，保证把全部工程修得又快又好又省。
    国务院副秘书长齐燕铭、中共北京市委农村工作部部长赵凡也参加了庆祝大会。
    由昨天下午开始的庆祝活动，今天下午达到了高潮。入夜，工地数万盏灯火，把水库的万顷洪水照耀得分外光明，工地上处处歌舞喧天，从北京等地赶来参加庆祝活动的二十五个剧团为二十五万水库建设者演出了精彩的节目。
    新华社1日讯　全国大型综合性水利工程之一——密云水库已经胜利拦洪，现在库内碧波万顷，原来的一些山峰，在汪洋的库海中已成几点孤岛，滔滔的洪流正从人们安排好的隧洞、廊道中缓缓东流。
    这个可以蓄水四十一亿立方米的大型水库，今年拦蓄了八点五六亿多立方米的洪水。在8月上旬暴雨期间，上游三千一百秒立方米的洪峰经过水库拦蓄后，流到下游时，只有四百秒立方米，使下游约四百万亩田地免受水灾的侵袭，在防汛期中并且节省了沿岸人民大量的劳动力。
    这个水库的工程十分浩大，在通常情况下，要准备一二年，施工四五年。但水库的二十万建设者，在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，只用了一年的时间，就取得了拦洪的胜利。现已完成土石砂二千五百二十八万立方米，占工程总量的70％左右。白河大坝和潮河大坝两座主坝，以及其他十七个副坝，都已先后达到或超过拦洪高程，潮河隧洞已在去年年底完工泄水。白河隧洞正在进行混凝土衬砌，溢洪道也已挖到了临时泄洪高程，剩下的工作量尚有30％左右。水库工程完工后，除可免除下游密云、怀柔、顺义、通州、宝坻、蓟县、武清、汉沽等县区的水患外，还可灌溉农田四百万亩，每年发电一亿一千万度，对解决京津两市的工业用水问题也有很大的意义。
    密云水库位于首都东北密云县境，跨越潮、白两河。潮河和白河发源于燕山山脉的承德和张家口地区，流经京津地区入渤海。河的上游势高水急，下游河道狭窄，京津一带约四千平方公里的地区，在汛期经常遭受水灾，1949年就有六百万亩土地被淹，受灾人口达一百多万。解放以后，潮白河两岸的人民在党的领导下，和水患进行了顽强的斗争，年年都大力固堤防汛。去年在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，党和政府决定提前根除潮白河的水患，根治潮、白河的枢纽工程——密云水库在去年的今天动工兴建。
    这个水库是在水利电力部的具体指导下，由河北省和北京市协力兴建的。来自河北省和北京市二十一个县区一百八十多个人民公社的十九万多社员，以及随后在汛前参加建设的中国人民解放军一万多官兵，在施工过程中，发挥了高度的革命干劲。电工们冒着风雪在高空架设电线，铁路工人随着工程进展，日夜抢修铁路，有些民工吊在高达五十多米高的悬崖陡壁上，在寒冷的西北风中削坡凿岭。在汛期日益逼近的5月，工地展开了抢工拦洪的竞赛运动。各路建设大军分秒必争，寸土不让，你追我赶。白河零二火车线创日运料二万七千立方米的最高纪录。坝身填筑的工效不断提高。从去年10月份日平均填二万二千九百多立方米，逐步提高到今年5月份的日平均七万五千九百七十九立方米。进入汛期以后，阴雨连绵，洪水逼人，抢工拦洪的紧张战斗开始了。全体工人、民工、军工和干部发动了三次“战役”，抢修粘土斜墙。解放军官兵创造日升九点九二五米全国人工夯的最高纪录。白河工地修配厂的职工创造了“快速安装皮带机法”，每半小时就安装一台皮带机，提高了工效四倍多。在一场暴雨中，小黑河围堰决口，白河大坝上游工地受到严重威胁，解放军官兵和武清支队的民工临危不惧，跳到急流中去抢险。7月底，潮河库内水位猛涨，建设者们喊出“水涨一寸，坡升一尺”的口号，日夜抢砌护坡，跑在了洪水的前面。8月上旬的几次暴雨之后，白河库内水位猛涨，为了保证大坝的安全，民工和军工在抢修泄洪引渠的施工中，连续坚持了二十多小时的紧张劳动，有的军工连续战斗三十六个小时不下工地。在工地上，那里有困难，那里就有解放军官兵。在轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛中，先后涌现出四千八百多先进集体，先进生产者达十四万八千多人次，这些英雄人物中，有二千多人在工地上参加了中国共产党。
    工地上开展的技术革新运动，对工程的迅速进展起了很大的作用。各个支队都有自己的工厂，干部和群众破除迷信，大胆革新，在两个月内，经试制成功并投入生产的新工具即达一百二十三种。在大量皮带机尚未运到工地的情况下，民工们创造了绳索牵引机，宝砥支队副政委创造了五滑轮牵引机，这些“土机械”比推车上坝的工效提高了五倍到十倍。给汽车装料采取“料斗翻板式”的方法后，装一车只用一分到两分钟的时间，提高工率十倍。皮带机采取“多口散料台”和“漏斗式”等散料方法，都大大地提高了工效。当大量机械到达工地以后，工地又碰到没有技术工人的困难，建设者坚持自力更生，采取边学边作、边作边学的方法，打破常规，用短期训练办法从民工中培养拖拉机手、汽车司机、皮带运输机和水电技工等七千多名。
    全国各地人民对水库的建设，给了很大的支援。来自三百九十个工矿、企业、机关、学校的工人、干部、技术人员达五千多名，其中有二千四百多名技术工人是来自一百四十个建设岗位。福建省的广大人民，突击四昼夜，为工地集中、调运了二十万条草袋。
    人民公社运动对水库的建设，起了特别重要的作用。民工中有许多并非直接受益区。但是，公社化以后，农民们打破只顾本乡本土的传统观念，发扬共产主义大协作的精神，他们携带着大量的手推车、木材和工具，和受益区的民工们并肩作战。各公社对于参加水库建设的社员，照常记劳动工分、统一解决民工家庭中生活的一些特殊困难，并且还经常组织慰问团到工地慰问，介绍家乡的生产、生活情况，鼓舞民工的干劲。家乡人民对水库工地从政治上和人力、物力上的大力支援，充分说明了工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社的无比优越性。
    根据党的八届八中全会的精神，工地党委现正进一步加强政治思想工作。鼓干劲，争上游，在拦洪胜利的基础上，大战9月份，决心创造新成就，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
