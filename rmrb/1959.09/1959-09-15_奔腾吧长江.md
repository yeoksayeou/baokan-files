Roar On, Yangtze River
By Our Correspondent Hai Bo

The Yangtze River is beautiful, and the Yangtze River at night is even more beautiful. As night falls, the beautiful peaks on both banks, the sturdy trees, and the vast golden rice paddies slowly disappear, and the turbulent river water changes from yellow to dark gray. At this time, various electric lights, like pearls, radiate colorful light, lined up in strings on both banks of the Yangtze River and reflected in the river, giving the Yangtze River a new look. These are the electrified navigation marks and signal lights that have been built in recent years. Ships, one after another, illuminated by the brilliant light, cut through the water like daytime, riding the wind and waves, rushing forward, delivering goods to cities and villages, and transporting passengers to their destinations. When young friends travel on the Yangtze River, they are often intoxicated by the beautiful scenery and magnificent momentum, while the elderly and old sailors are always filled with deep thoughts when they pass through these places. The Yangtze River is a beautiful and rich river. It is like a sparkling belt tied around the waist of the motherland. It irrigates hundreds of millions of acres of fertile land and nurtures nearly two hundred million people. There are countless dense forests, boundless rice and cotton fields, inexhaustible fresh fish, and countless mineral deposits. China's largest cities, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing, grow on its banks, and China's famous steel bases, Wuhan Iron and Steel and Daye Steel Plant, are growing here. It is one of the best rivers in the world for navigation, and it has provided the people with the benefits of boats since ancient times. It is more than 5,000 kilometers long, and 2,800 kilometers from Yibin to Shanghai can be navigated by ships of more than 1,000 tons, of which the section from Hankou to Shanghai can be navigated by 10,000-ton giant ships. However, under the rule of reactionary forces, the Yangtze River suffered a tragic fate for a long time. The Three Gorges from Fengjie, Sichuan, to Yichang, Hubei, have always been known as a natural barrier, with many shoals, rapid currents, and a forest of hidden reefs; many areas downstream are silted up with mud and sand, and the航道 is constantly changing. Before liberation, several ships were smashed to pieces in these places every year, and countless lives and property were buried at the bottom of the river. This is not the biggest tragedy of the Yangtze River. The invasion of imperialism brought even more profound disasters to the Yangtze River. The rich Yangtze River has long been coveted by imperialism. After the Opium War in 1842, imperialists forced the Chinese feudal ruling forces to open up treaty ports on both sides of the Yangtze River and seized the right to navigate inland rivers; then, their merchant ships and warships entered the Yangtze River together. Like bloodsuckers, they sucked the blood and sweat of the Chinese people through the Yangtze River; they ran rampant on the Yangtze River, occupied the wharves, and not only prevented Chinese ships from approaching, but even Chinese people who wanted to be dockworkers had to pay bribes of several stones of rice. In those years, imperialists repeatedly sent warships into the Yangtze River to commit atrocities, using cannons to bombard the Chinese people who resisted oppression. Batches of Chinese people in Wanxian and Nanjing died under the cannons of these robbers. Under the tyranny of imperialism, China's national shipping industry could not develop at all, and even if it did develop a little, they tried every means to squeeze it out. In order to compete, the British companies Taikoo and Jardine reduced the freight rate for cotton from Shanghai to Chongqing from 25 yuan per piece to 4 yuan, and also gave the shippers three "ninety-five" discounts. Nissin even loaded goods free of charge and gave away umbrellas. … What kind of sky-high ability could the national shipping industry have to resist them! At that time, the blood and tears of the Chinese people flowed together with the yellow river water, and the Chinese people and the Yangtze River groaned in suffering.

But these are all things of the past. Now, the Yangtze River is completely different. As long as you take a ship of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration and travel on the Yangtze River once, you will fully understand this.

Now, when people step onto the Yangtze River wharf, they can immediately see the unique bustling scene here. Dear friends, do you still remember the life of dockworkers in the old society, which was worse than that of cattle and horses? Do you still remember the tragic sight of dockworkers carrying a large bag of hundreds of pounds on their backs, bent over? Do you still remember the miserable moans they made? All of this has changed drastically in our newly built port wharves. Here, the heavy labor of the past has been replaced by huge cranes, various out-of-warehouse machines, belt conveyors, electric vehicles and other various machines. These machines load or unload tons of grain, steel, various building materials... onto ships or ashore; all of these mechanical equipment were built after liberation. In the few years since liberation, the Yangtze River has transformed many old ports, built a number of new ports, and greatly improved the degree of mechanization. The port's throughput capacity has increased sevenfold, and the loading and unloading efficiency has increased dozens of times. Please visit Yuxikou Port in Anhui, which was built not long ago! This is a special wharf for transporting coal. The train transports coal from the Huainan Coal Mine here. Without any manual labor, the coal will flow like a black torrent through mechanical equipment onto the ship. A thousand-ton ship can be loaded in less than two hours. Such a modern port is also under construction in Hankou Port. Now, the tragic moans of the workers on the docks are gone, and what remains is cheerful singing. Listen: "The red sun rises in the East, illuminating poisonous snakes and tigers and wolves, the black and white flags fall down, and the red flag is planted in Yichang Port. … The whole body's cells dance together, taking three steps as one, eating hard work as honey dates, to turn the port into paradise. …" This is a song sung by Huang Shengxiao, a dockworker and famous poet in Yichang, and it is also a song sung by all the dockworkers on the Yangtze River. Those brand-new, huge ships are even more unforgettable than the docks. Some of these ships are transformed from old ships, and most of them are built by our own workers. In the 70 or 80 years before liberation, old China left more than 200,000 tons of junk ships on the Yangtze River for the Chinese people, and we have increased it three times in just ten years. What a huge leap forward! Not only are there many ships, but they are also good. All the equipment on the passenger ships is built under the guidance of the idea of "serving the people." The crowded and dirty phenomenon of the past on ships is completely gone. Every passenger and crew member has a berth. The cleanliness of the ship makes people feel spotless. The various facilities on the ship make people feel comfortable and convenient. If you want to eat, there is a spacious dining hall. If you want to buy things, there is a store on the ship. Comrades who like to dance can also find a suitable place here. The ships on the Yangtze River in the motherland are simply water parks.

Some people think that the life of sailors is boring. This is a misunderstanding for sailors in socialist society. The fact is completely the opposite. None of them does not regard their water life as their pride. They said: "It is the greatest happiness to sail freely in one's own rivers." They dedicate everything to this free voyage. It is precisely because of this that the Yangtze River has undergone such great changes in just ten years. Let's first talk about the old model worker Mo Jiarui: He is a 53-year-old captain. His more than 30 years of life as a seaman have made him old and also made him particularly strong. He was the first hero to reveal the mystery of night航行 on the Sichuan River. The Sichuan River, that is, the section from Yichang to Chongqing, passes through the Three Gorges, with many shoals, rapid currents, and a forest of hidden reefs, and has always been known as the gate of hell. Since ancient times, it has only been possible to navigate during the day, and even during the day, I don't know how many ships and people's lives and property have been lost. In 1953, when the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was being built at an accelerated pace, a large number of materials were piled up in Yichang and could not be transported to the construction site in time, which affected the progress of the project. When Mo Jiarui learned about this, his heart was really aching. Old Mo thought for a while and went to the leaders to put forward his suggestion: In order to save time and support national construction, try night航行 under the moonlight. The leading comrade said: "I'm afraid it won't work. If there is an accident, it will be terrible!" Old Mo put forward his irrefutable reasons and insisted on doing it. The leaders knew that Old Mo had always been cautious and that the suggestions he put forward had been considered, so they supported him. The航行 began. Old Mo drove himself, taking advantage of the moonlight, relying on experience, and adding enough horsepower to bypass countless large and small hidden reefs. Night航行 was finally successful, shortening the round-trip time from Yichang to Chongqing by one day. Someone asked Old Mo, "Why are you so bold?" Old Mo answered simply: "Think about the past, compare it to the present, how can people not work hard?"

Dear friends, have you seen such a miracle? A small instrument weighing only four pounds, one foot and two inches long, six inches wide, and four inches high can be used to drive those thousands of tons of giant ships. This small thing replaces the six complex operating instruments of the past: driver, engine, rudder, whistle, and vehicle. It has opened the way for the automation and electrification of ship driving, greatly improved labor efficiency, and saved a lot of manpower. This is the "long-distance electric control driving instrument" invented by Zhang Jinhai, the chief engineer of the Yangtze River No. 601 ship, in 1958.

What a remarkable creation!

When talking about Yangtze River shipping with old passengers, they are very interested in Mo Jiarui's courage and Zhang Jinhai's wisdom, but the most widely circulated story is "Xiao Mingshu Finds His Father." Xiao Mingshu's father works in Shanghai, but seven-year-old Mingshu stays in Zizhong County, his hometown in Sichuan. Mingshu misses his father very much, but his father is too busy with work and the journey is too far, so he cannot pick up his daughter immediately. What to do? After a lot of thought, the father went to the Railway Bureau and the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau to "try his luck." He wrote a letter requesting the two units to help him bring his daughter to Shanghai. The letter was answered by the above two units not long after it was sent. They said in unison, "This is our task and should be done." From Zizhong to Shanghai is 2,500 kilometers, of which nearly 2,000 kilometers are by boat. At first, the father was worried that his daughter was too young and it would be inconvenient to walk. But it didn't take long for the father to fully understand how unnecessary that concern was. Only one month and two days after receiving the letter, the amiable crew members brought Mingshu, whom he had been waiting for day and night and who had grown up beautifully, to him. Mingshu got off the boat clean and tidy, and full of energy, not at all like she had been on a long journey. Because the crew members, such as Teng Zhaoxiang, took care of Xiao Mingshu on the road as if she were their own daughter. When she was hungry, they would immediately bring her food; when she went to bed at night, Teng Zhaoxiang and others would get up in the middle of the night to cover her with a quilt. Everything she did on the boat was more comfortable than at home. Therefore, when the father saw Xiao Mingshu, he looked at his beloved daughter and was so excited that he shed tears, held the crew member's hand tightly, and couldn't speak. Yes, how can people not be excited? In those days before liberation, who would dare to imagine entrusting a child of only seven years old to a stranger to take her so far?

All of these heroic and glorious labors of the sailors have created wealth for the motherland and won the love of the people. Many ships have received a large number of letters and big-character posters from passengers and carriers, praising their heroic labor. In one voyage of the Jianghe Ship, 467 out of 578 passengers praised the service work of the crew. The Jiangping Ship once had 1,006 people, but it received 1,024 letters of praise. Some of them wrote "Guests feel at home," and some wrote "Warm as home." They dedicated the most beautiful words to the crew.

However, the crew members never said that these achievements were their own. They are best at attributing it to the Party and the government. Zhang Jinhai, who invented the electric driving control instrument, said excitedly when he was praised by his superiors: "I should never be praised like this. I was a fueler on the ship when I was twelve years old. Before liberation, I worked for decades, but I couldn't even touch the edge of technology. Only after liberation, with the education and training of the Party, did I get a little technology, and only with the specific support of the Party could I have this creation. If Chiang Kai-shek was still here, I would never have this invention in my life." These are words from the bottom of his heart. Yes, without the leadership of the Party, the crew members would not be where they are today, and the Yangtze River shipping industry would not be so prosperous. It was the sound of the cannons of liberation that drove away all the evil forces that were oppressing the crew members, liberating them and freeing them. The Party also educated and trained them, opening up the possibility for their creative labor. From the first day of liberation, the Party determined the policy of "serving the people" for the Yangtze River Shipping Administration. And it has successfully transformed private capitalist shipping enterprises, turning them from self-serving negative forces into positive forces serving the people. Large-scale basic construction of Yangtze River shipping also began after liberation. In the ten years since liberation, the state has invested more than 370 million yuan in the Yangtze River shipping industry to build ships, build航道s, and build ports. A large number of hidden reefs in the Three Gorges have been blasted away, and more than 5 million cubic meters of silt have been dredged from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Moreover, larger construction is underway, new ports are being built, a shipyard capable of building 5,000-ton giant ships is under construction, and the huge Three Gorges water conservancy project is being actively prepared. The Yangtze River is moving forward, the Yangtze River is roaring. The Yangtze River is striding towards the world with youthful steps. When "high gorges produce calm lakes," the Yangtze River will have a new scene. The leadership of the Party plus the revolutionary vigor of the sailors, like a huge wave, will break through all difficulties and bring new life! Roar on, Yangtze River, let your waves fly higher, let your waters flow faster, and use all your strength to be a pioneer in building socialism.

    奔腾吧长江
    本报记者　海波
    长江是美丽的，长江之夜更美。当夜幕刚刚降临的时候，那两岸秀丽的山峰，苍劲的树木，大片金黄色的稻田慢慢消失了，波浪滔滔的江水由黄色变成了暗灰色。这时候，各色电灯像珍珠一样，放射着五彩缤纷的光芒，成串地排在长江两岸倒映在江水之中，又使长江披上了新装。这是最近几年才建设的电气化航标和信号灯。轮船一只接着一只，在灿烂的光芒照耀下，像白天一样，划开水面，乘风破浪，疾驰前进，把货物送到城市和农村，把旅客送到自己要去的地方。年轻的朋友们在长江上旅行的时候，往往陶醉在这美丽的景色、雄壮的气势中，而老年人、老船员，他们在经过这些地方的时候，总是引起无限的深思。长江是一条既美丽又富饶的大江。它像系在祖国腰间的一条闪闪发光的宝带。它灌溉着几亿亩良田，哺育着近两亿人民。这里有着无数茂密的森林，有一望无际的稻田和棉田，有吃不尽的鲜鱼，有数不清的矿藏。我国最大的城市上海、武汉、重庆生长在它两岸，我国著名的钢铁基地武钢和大冶钢厂在这里成长。它是世界上航运条件最好的大河之一，自古以来就给人民以舟楫之利。它全长五千多公里，从宜宾到上海二千八百多公里，可以通行千吨以上轮船，其中从汉口到上海更可通行万吨巨轮。但是，在反动势力统治下，长江长期遭受着悲惨的命运。从四川奉节到湖北宜昌以上的三峡，这一段向称天险，滩多流急，暗礁林立；下游不少地区则泥沙淤塞，航道变化无常。解放前哪一年曾有几艘轮船在这些地方粉身碎骨，不知使多少人的生命财产葬身江底。这还不是长江最大的悲哀，帝国主义的侵略给长江带来了更加深重的灾难。富饶的长江早就被帝国主义看中了。当1842年鸦片战争以后，帝国主义就纷纷强迫中国封建统治势力在长江两岸开辟通商口岸，并且夺取了内河航行权；接着，他们的商船和兵舰一起开进了长江，他们像吸血虫一样，通过长江吸吮中国人民的血汗；他们横行在长江上，霸占着码头，不仅不让中国船只靠拢，就是中国人想当码头工人也要拿几石大米的贿赂才行。在那些年代里，帝国主义一次又一次地把兵舰开进长江行凶，用大炮轰击反抗压迫的中国人民，万县、南京成批的中国人民死在这些强盗的大炮之下。在帝国主义的淫威下，中国的民族航运事业根本无法发展，即是发展一点，他们也千方百计地把它挤垮。为了竞争，英国的太古、怡和两公司把上海到重庆的棉花运价由每件二十五元降到四元，还给货主三个“九五”扣。日清公司甚至装货不收费用还外赠洋伞。……民族航运事业有什么钻天的本事可以抗得过他们啊！那时候，中国人民的鲜血、眼泪和黄色的江水流在一起，中国人民和长江在苦难中呻吟。
    但是，这些都是早已过去的事了。现在，长江完全是另一个样子。只要你坐上长江航运管理局的轮船，在长江旅行一次，你就会完全明白这一点。
    现在，当人们走上长江码头的时候，就立即可以看到这里的那种特有的繁忙景象。亲爱的朋友们，你们还记得旧社会码头工人那种牛马不如的生活吗？还记得码头工人背上驮着一个几百斤的大包压得弓腰驼背的惨像吗？还记得他们发出的那种凄惨的呻吟吗？这一切在我们新建的港口码头上已经大变了。在这里，昔日的笨重劳动已由巨大的起重机，各种出仓机、皮带运输机、电瓶车等各种各样的机械代替了。这些机械把成吨的粮食、钢铁、各种建筑材料……装到船上或卸下岸来；所有这些机械设备都是解放以后建设的。解放几年来，长江改造了许多旧港口，建设了一批新港口，机械化程度大大提高了。港口吞吐能力增加了七倍，装卸效力提高了几十倍。请到不久以前建成的安徽裕溪口港参观一下吧！这是一个运煤的专用码头，火车把淮南煤矿的煤运到这里，根本不用人动手，煤就会像黑色的巨流一样通过机械设备流到船上去，一千吨的大船，不到两小时，就可以装满。像这样现代化的港口，汉口港也在建设中。现在的码头上，工人的那种悲惨的呻吟声没有了，有的是愉快的歌声。请听：“东方升起红太阳，照化毒蛇和虎狼，黑白花旗倒下来，红旗插上宜昌港。……浑身细胞齐跳舞，三步当作一步上，苦干当成蜜枣吞，要把港口变天堂。……”这是宜昌码头工人、著名诗人黄声孝唱的歌，也是整个长江码头工人唱的歌。那些簇新的、巨大的轮船，比码头还使人流连忘返。这些轮船一部分是旧船改造成的，大部分是我国工人自己造成的。解放前七、八十年来，旧中国在长江上给中国人民留下了二十几万吨破烂船，而我们仅仅十年就使它增加了三倍。这是多么巨大的跃进啊！不仅船多，而且又好。客船上的一切设备，都是在“为人民服务”的思想指导下建成的，过去轮船上的那种拥挤、肮脏的现象根本不见了，每个乘客和船员都有一个铺位，船上的清洁使人有一尘不染的感觉，船上的各种设备使人感到舒适而方便，想吃饭，有宽敞的饭厅，买东西船上有商店，喜欢跳舞的同志在这里也可以找到适当的地方。祖国长江上的轮船，简直是水上乐园。
    有人认为，船员的生活是枯燥的，这对社会主义社会的海员来说，是一种误解。事实完全相反，他们没有一个人不把自己的水上生活看做是自己的骄傲。他们说：“在自己的江河里自由航行，这是最大的幸福”。他们把自己的一切献给这自由的航行。正是因为这，长江才会在短短的十年内发生这样大的巨变。先让我们谈一下老模范莫家瑞吧：这是一个五十三岁的老船长，三十多年来的海员生活使他变得苍老，也使他格外坚强。他是第一个揭开川江夜航之迷的英雄。川江，即从宜昌到重庆一段，经过三峡、滩多、流急、暗礁如林，向称鬼门关。有史以来都只能白日航行，而且即使白天航行也不知损失了多少船舶和人民生命财产。1953年当成渝铁路正在加紧修筑的时候，大批材料堆在宜昌不能及时运到工地，影响工程进度。这事叫莫家瑞知道了，真是心如刀绞。老莫想了一番，找着领导提出自己的建议：为了争取时间，支援国家建设，在月光下，试行夜航。领导同志说：“怕不行吧，出了危险不得了！”老莫摆出了自己无可反驳的理由，坚决要干。领导上知道老莫这人向来慎重，提出的建议是经过考虑的，于是支持了他。航行开始了，老莫亲自驾驶，趁着月明，凭着经验，又加足马力，绕过了无数大大小小的暗礁，夜航终于成功了，使宜昌到重庆的往返时间缩短了一天。有人问老莫“为啥这么大胆”，老莫回答得干脆：“想想过去，比比现在，人们怎能不拼命干呢？”
    亲爱的朋友，你们看到这样的奇迹吗？一个只有四斤重、一尺二寸长、六寸宽、四寸高的小小仪器，凭它可以驾驶那几千吨的巨轮。这个小小东西代替了过去的驾、机、舵、汽笛、车等六种复杂操纵仪器，它给轮船驾驶自动化电气化开辟了道路，大大提高了劳动效率，节省了大批人力。这就是长江601号轮机长张金海1958年发明的“远距离电动操纵驾驶仪”。
    这是一个多么了不起的创造啊！
    在和老乘客谈起长江航运的时候，他们对莫家瑞的勇敢、张金海的智慧很感兴趣，但流传最广的故事还数“小明蜀找爸爸”。小明蜀的爸爸在上海工作，七岁的小明蜀却留在四川老家资中县，明蜀很想爸爸，但爸爸工作太忙，路途又远，无法立刻接女儿出来。怎么办呢？爸爸在费了很多脑筋之后，便到铁路局和长江航运局“碰运气”。他写信要求两个单位帮助他把女儿接到上海来。这信发出不久就得到了上述两个单位的答复，他们异口同声地说“这是自己的任务，应该办。”从资中到上海有二千五百多公里，其中坐船近二千公里。开始，爸爸还担心女儿太小，走路不方便。但爸爸担心没有多久，他便完全明白那种顾虑是多么不必要了。在他接到信仅仅一个月零两天以后，和蔼的船员就把他日夜盼望、长得漂亮的明蜀送到了自己的跟前了。明蜀下船时清洁整齐，精神饱满，完全不像经过长途旅行的样子。因为船员滕兆祥等人在路上把小明蜀当作自己的女儿一般照顾。她饿了，马上就把饭拿来；晚上睡觉时，滕兆祥等人半夜起来给她盖被子，她在船上的一切比在自家还随心。因此，当爸爸看到小明蜀的时候，一面看看心爱的女儿，一面激动得流着眼泪，紧握着船员的手，说不出话来。是的，怎样能使人不激动呢？在解放以前的那些日子里，谁敢设想，把一个只有七岁的孩子交给素不相识的人带这样远呢？
    海员们的这一切英勇和光荣的劳动，给祖国创造了财富，赢得了人民的热爱，很多轮船都收到大批旅客和承运单位的信件和大字报，表扬他们的英勇劳动。江和轮在一次航行中五百七十八个乘客就有四百六十七人表扬船员的服务工作。江平轮有一次有一千零六人，收到的表扬信却有一千零二十四份。他们有的写“宾至如归”，有的写“温暖如家”。他们把最美好的词句献给船员。
    但是，船员们从来不把这些功劳说成是自己的。他们最善于把它归功于党和政府。发明电动驾驶操纵仪的张金海在受到上级表扬时，激动地说：“绝不应这样表扬，我十二岁就在船上当加油工，解放前，干了几十年，但连技术边也沾不到。只有在解放后，有了党的教育培养才摸到一点技术，又在党的具体支持下才能有这个创造，要是还是蒋介石在这里，我这一辈子也不会有这个发明的。”这是肺腑之言。是的，没有党的领导，船员们是不会有今天的，长江航运是不会有这样繁荣的。是解放的炮声赶走了压在船员头上的一切恶势力，使他们解放了，自由了，党又教育和培养了他们，给他们的创造性的劳动开辟了可能性。从解放的第一天起，党就给长江航运局确定了“为人民服务”的方针。并胜利地改造了私人资本主义航运企业，使他们由唯利是图的消极力量，变成了为人民服务的积极力量。大规模的长江航运基本建设也是解放后开始的。解放十年来，国家对长江航运事业投资达三亿七千多万元，来修建船舶，建设航道、港口。三峡的大批暗礁被炸掉了，长江中下游的淤泥被挖掉了五百多万立方米，而且，更大的建设正在积极进行中，新的港口在建设，一个能造五千吨巨轮的造船厂在建设中，巨大的三峡水利枢纽工程正在积极准备中。长江在前进，长江在奔腾。长江正以青春的脚步跨向人间。当“高峡出平湖”的时候，长江更有一番新的情景。党的领导加上海员的革命干劲，有如万丈波涛，会冲破一切困难，带来新生！奔腾吧，长江，让你的浪花飞得更高，让你的大水流得更快，用你的全副力量作建设社会主义的先锋。
