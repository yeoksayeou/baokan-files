Ten Years of Earth-shaking Change
Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League

The cannons roared, and the five-star red flag slowly rose. Chairman Mao loudly declared to the world: the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the only legal government representing the people of the whole country, is established. Thunderous applause resounded through the sky.... Ten years have passed, and the solemn scene of Tiananmen Square on October 1, 1949, still echoes in my mind.

Today's square no longer has low bungalows and red walls. What is presented to us is that the square has been expanded several times, and the majestic Great Hall of the People and the Revolution and History Museum stand on both sides. The solemn Monument to the People's Heroes is built in the center of the square. It is truly a new look, reflecting the great spirit of the motherland, and is also an epitome of the earth-shaking changes in the motherland over the past ten years.

Ten years is only a moment in the entire history of China, but in these short ten years, the Chinese people have done things that the predecessors have never dreamed of for thousands of years.

Our ancestors have always dreamed of a society where "no one exploits anyone," "everyone has clothes to wear, everyone has food to eat, and everyone has a house to live in." This wish has not been realized for thousands of years, but we have already achieved it in these ten years.

For thousands of years, the people have been looking forward to being masters of their own affairs but have not been able to. But today, the working people on our 9.6 million square kilometers have truly begun to rule this land.

The past ten years have been ten years of brilliant achievements in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and ten years of unprecedentedly high ideological awareness of the people of the whole country. After the land reform and the cooperative movement, 500 million farmers invested in the vigorous people's commune movement last year, accelerating socialist construction and paving the way to communism. Under the leadership of the Party and the supervision of the workers, capitalist industry and commerce, after the education of the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, victoriously and basically completed the socialist transformation in 1956. It is unprecedented to complete the socialist transformation economically in these short eight years. This is a great success of the Chinese Communist Party in creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to solve the problem of socialist transformation of ownership of the means of production in my country based on China's specific conditions.

Due to the change in production relations, the productive forces have been unprecedentedly developed. Grain production has increased 1.3 times in nine years. This speed has never been seen in our country's history, while in the United States, it took 43 years to increase agricultural production by 71%. In ten years, the earthwork and stonework projects carried out in water conservancy alone are equivalent to more than 500 Great Walls. In ten years, the increased irrigation area is more than that managed in three thousand years.

Who could have imagined that China, which was "poor and blank," would lay a preliminary foundation for industrialization only ten years later. In ten years, an average of one large-scale factory or mine was put into production every three days. The high speed of industrial development in our country is not only unprecedented in our country's history, but also beyond the reach of capitalist countries. You see, the annual output of foreign steel in our country has increased to 8 million tons after nine years, while in the history of capitalist countries, it took Britain 45 years and France 52 years to increase the same amount of steel. From the establishment of a steel plant in China in 1890 to 1949, including the Northeast operated by the Japanese invaders, a total of only 7.6 million tons were produced, while last year alone it exceeded it, equivalent to one year exceeding fifty-nine years. The annual coal output reached 270 million tons after nine years, while the United States took 32 years.

We already have self-made "Liberation" and "Red Flag" brand cars, silver-swallow-style jet planes, 10,000-ton ocean freighters and various tractors! Walking on the ground, in the air, and on the sea is also a miracle that predecessors could not have imagined.

The decisive factor for the great victory that the Chinese people have achieved in the past ten years is the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Countless facts have proved that this is the victory of Marxism-Leninism. It is the victory of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

The past ten years have been ten years of great victory for the Chinese people in the struggle against imperialism. When the country was founded, Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their failure, and they will make a final struggle." Less than a year after the founding of the country, in 1950, American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, the purpose of which was not only to destroy Korea, but more importantly, to further invade China. In order to resist America and aid Korea and defend our homeland, the Chinese people sent volunteers to fight alongside the Korean People's Army, and finally completely defeated the American aggressors, realized the Korean armistice, and made the United States suffer a "biggest defeat in the history of the US Army" after the victory of the Chinese revolution.

In Indochina, after the failure of the US plot to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, our country again conducted a sharp struggle with the United States on the issue of American aggression against Taiwan. American imperialism carried out barbaric interference in our country's sacred cause of liberating Taiwan. In June 1950, the United States used force to invade and occupy our territory Taiwan while launching the war of aggression against Korea. Since then, it has continuously carried out various aggressive provocations against our country in the Taiwan Strait. In 1954, especially in August last year, the United States mobilized troops everywhere and made the largest concentration in American history to carry out military provocations and war threats against our country. However, the heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely fought back against these provocative activities, causing the aggressors to suffer a shameful defeat. The United States then attempted to realize the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" in order to permanently occupy Taiwan. But this conspiracy is also doomed to failure.

Countless facts in the past ten years have proved Chairman Mao's famous thesis: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." The experience of struggle in the past ten years tells us: never be afraid of imperialism, only by resolutely fighting against it can we stop aggression and ensure the smooth development of socialist construction.

We are clearly aware that the current development of the international situation is that the East Wind is increasingly prevailing over the West Wind, which is increasingly unfavorable to imperialism and favorable to socialism. It is impossible for the American aggressors to stay in Taiwan. As Chairman Mao pointed out long ago, China's territory Taiwan and all the US military bases in foreign countries are nooses around the necks of US imperialism. The longer the American robbers stay in these places, the tighter the noose around their necks. The Chinese people must liberate their own territory Taiwan, and they will surely be able to liberate it, and will never give up until the goal is achieved!

The Taiwan compatriots who are in deep water and suffering from the trampling of American imperialism, when they heard the news of the founding of the People's Republic of China ten years ago today, everyone was overjoyed and told each other. In the past ten years, under the exploitation of American imperialism, the more painful they are, the more they miss their mother—the motherland. Today, when they know the prosperity and strength of the motherland, the increasing international status, and the rich and colorful lives of the people, when they hear the people of the motherland celebrating the glorious tenth anniversary, they will surely be more sincerely happy and silently miss the motherland. We believe that the military and civilians in Taiwan will surely unite under the banner of patriotism, unite against foreign aggression, oppose the conspiracy of American aggression and the creation of "two Chinas," and strive to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.

The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and its members and Taiwan compatriots on the mainland have also undergone great changes in these ten years. Under the leadership of the Party and together with the people of the whole country, the broad masses of league members and Taiwan compatriots participated in the great "Five Great Movements" and "Three Great Transformations," participated in socialist construction, especially in 1957, they participated in the rectification and anti-rightist struggle—the socialist revolution in politics and ideology, thus enabling the Taiwan League organization and its members to take a decisive step on the road of socialist transformation. Under the earnest care of the Party, many league members and Taiwan compatriots have gained the trust of the people and have been elected as deputies to the National People's Congress, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, deputies to the provincial and municipal people's congresses and members of the CPPCC committees, and have served in leading positions at all levels of the country due to their improved political awareness and hard work. Many science and technology workers and cultural and educational workers of Taiwan origin have achieved new achievements in their work, and have thus been honorably elected as advanced workers and national model workers. More than a dozen athletes of Taiwan Province origin have been recommended by various provinces and cities as athletes to attend the First National Games. Many people have been honorably admitted as members of the Chinese Communist Party due to their improved awareness. Under the brilliant light of the Party's national policy, the Gaoshan ethnic compatriots on the mainland—the ethnic minorities of Taiwan—are active on all fronts of the motherland. Under the Party's cordial care, many people have changed from illiterate to university graduates in the past ten years. We all clearly know that all these progress and happiness are inseparable from the wise leadership and care of the Party and Chairman Mao. We once again sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao as we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. We are determined to unite closely with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, work hard to transform ourselves, oppose rightism, boost our energy, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan for the national economy ahead of schedule, strive to complete the main targets of the second five-year plan within this year, and strive to liberate Taiwan!

    翻天覆地的十年
    台湾民主自治同盟秘书长　徐萌山
    礼炮震天响，五星红旗徐徐升起，毛主席响亮地向全世界宣告：代表全国人民唯一合法政府，中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立了。雷动般的掌声响彻了天空……。十年过去了，1949年10月1日天安门广场的庄严情景，永远回旋在我的脑中。
    如今的广场，已瞧不见矮小平房与红墙。呈现在我们面前的是广场扩大了好几倍，巍峨雄伟的人民大会堂和革命与历史博物馆两大建筑矗立在东西两旁。庄严的烈士纪念碑建立在广场的中央，真是面貌一新，体现出祖国伟大的气魄，也是祖国十年来翻天覆地变化的缩影。
    十年在整个中国历史上只是一瞬之间，但在这短短的十年中我国人民却干出了几千年来前人从未梦想过的事。
    我们祖先一直在梦想着一个“没有人剥削人”“人人有衣穿，人人有饭吃，人人有房住”的社会，这个愿望几千年来都没有实现，但在这十年中我们已经做到了。
    几千年来人民盼望着当家作主而未盼到，但是今天我国九百六十万平方公里上面的劳动人民，现在真正开始统治这块地方了。
    过去十年是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设获得辉煌成就的十年，是全国人民思想觉悟空前高涨的十年。五亿农民经过了土地改革和合作化运动，去年又投入轰轰烈烈的人民公社化运动，加速着社会主义建设，铺平了走向共产主义的道路。资本主义工商业在党的领导下、工人的监督下，经过了三反、五反的教育，1956年胜利地基本完成了社会主义改造。在这短短的八年中完成了经济上的社会主义改造是史无前例的。这是中国共产党根据中国具体条件创造性地运用马克思列宁主义解决我国生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造问题的伟大成功。
    由于生产关系的变化，使生产力得到空前的发展。九年间粮食增长了一点三倍，这个速度在我国历史上是从未有过的，而在美国，农业产量方面用了四十三年的时间才增长71％。十年间仅仅兴修水利做的土石方工程等于五百多条万里长城。十年间增加的灌溉面积比三千年来经营的还多。
    谁能想到，“一穷二白”的中国，仅仅在十年后的今天，就奠定了工业化的初步基础。十年间，平均每三天就有一个规模巨大的厂矿投入生产。我国工业发展的高速度，不仅在我国历史上是空前的，而且也是资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。你看，我国洋钢的年产量经过九年增加为八百万吨，而资本主义国家在历史上增加同样多的钢，英国花了四十五年，法国花了五十二年。我国从1890年创办钢铁厂起到1949年包括日寇经营的东北在内，一共只生产了七百六十万吨，而去年一年就超过了它，等于一年超过五十九年。煤的年产量经过九年达到二亿七千万吨，而美国却花了三十二年的时间。
    我们已经有了自造的“解放”“红旗”牌汽车，银燕式的喷气飞机，万吨的海洋巨轮和各种拖拉机！在地上、在空中、在海洋上行走，这也是前人想不到的奇迹。
    十年来我国人民所以能取得这样伟大的胜利，决定的因素是党中央和毛主席的正确领导。无数的事实证明这是马克思列宁主义的胜利。是党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利。
    过去的十年是中国人民反对帝国主义斗争，取得伟大胜利的十年。当开国时毛主席就说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”开国不到一年，1950年美帝国主义就发动了侵朝战争，其目的不但是为了灭亡朝鲜，更重要的是为了进一步侵略中国。我国人民为了抗美援朝和保家卫国，派出了志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，终于彻底打垮了美国侵略者，实现了朝鲜停战，使美国在中国革命胜利后遭受一次“美国陆军史上最大的失败”。
    在印度支那，美国的扩大侵越战争的阴谋失败之后，我国又在美国侵略台湾问题上同美国进行了尖锐的斗争。美帝国主义对我国实现解放台湾的神圣事业进行了野蛮的干涉。1950年6月美国在发动侵朝战争的同时用武力侵占我国领土台湾，此后，不断在台湾海峡对我国进行各种侵略挑衅。在1954年，特别是去年8月美国到处调兵遣将做了美国历史上最大一次的集中，来对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。但是英勇的中国人民在党和毛主席的领导下坚决地反击了这些挑衅活动，使侵略者遭到可耻的失败。美国以后又企图实现制造“两个中国”的阴谋，便于永远霸占台湾。但是这个阴谋也是注定要失败的。
    十年来无数次的事实都证明了毛主席的著名论断：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”。十年来的斗争经验告诉我们：对帝国主义绝不要惧怕它，只有坚决起来进行斗争，才能制止侵略，才能保证社会主义建设的顺利发展。
    我们清楚地了解，目前国际形势的发展，是东风越来越压倒西风，越来越对帝国主义不利，而对社会主义有利。美国侵略者赖在台湾不走是不行的。正如毛主席所早已指出的，中国领土台湾以及所有美国在外国的军事基地，都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索，美国强盗在这些地方停留越久，套在这脖子上的绞索就越勒紧。我国人民一定要解放自己的领土台湾，而且一定能解放，不达目的，誓不罢休！
    处在水深火热，受美帝蹂躏的台湾同胞，在十年前的今天，一听到中华人民共和国成立的消息，人人欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。十年来，在美帝的压榨下，越痛苦就越怀念母亲——祖国。今天当他们知道了祖国的繁荣富强，国际地位的日益提高，人民生活的丰富多彩的时候，当他们听到了祖国人民在庆祝辉煌的十周年的时候，他们一定会更加衷心喜悦，默念着祖国。我们相信，台湾军民同胞一定会在爱国主义的旗帜下团结起来，一致对外，反对美国侵略和制造“两个中国”的阴谋，争取早日回到祖国的怀抱里来。
    台湾民主自治同盟及其成员和在大陆的台湾同胞，在这十年里也有很大的变化。广大盟员和台胞在党的领导下和全国人民一道，参加了伟大的“五大运动”和“三大改造”，参加了社会主义建设，特别是1957年参加了整风、反右派斗争——政治上、思想上的社会主义革命，从而使台盟组织及成员个人在社会主义改造的路程上跨上了决定性的一大步。在党的殷切的关怀下不少盟员和台胞，由于政治觉悟的提高和努力工作，得到了人民的信任，被选为全国人民代表大会代表、全国政协委员、省市人大代表和政协委员，以及担任着国家各级的领导工作。不少台湾籍的科学工作者及文教工作者，在工作上取得了新的成就，因而光荣地被选为先进工作者、全国劳动模范等。有十多位台湾省籍运动员被各个省市推选为出席第一届全国运动大会的选手。不少人由于觉悟的提高，光荣地被吸收为中国共产党员。在大陆的高山族同胞——台湾的少数民族，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，活跃在祖国的各个战线上，很多人在党的亲切抚育下，十年来从文盲变为大学毕业生。我们都清楚地知道，所有这些进步和幸福，都与党和毛主席的英明领导和关怀爱护分不开的。我们在举国欢庆建国十周年时再一次衷心地感谢中国共产党和毛主席。我们决心在党中央和毛主席的领导下，和全国人民一起，紧密地团结一致，努力改造自己，反右倾，鼓干劲，为提前完成和超额完成今年的国民经济跃进计划而奋斗，为在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗，为解放台湾而奋斗！
