Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 27th (TASS dispatch): Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, delivered a television address in Washington on September 27th. The full text is as follows:

    American friends, good evening!

    I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you before returning home. We like your beautiful cities, excellent roads, and, most importantly, the sincere and kind people. I hope my words will not be understood as mere polite and respectful compliments from a guest to the host.

    Those who have visited the Soviet Union have probably spoken of the Soviet people's deep goodwill towards you and their desire to live in peace and friendship with you. Now I will return home with the conviction that you also hold these feelings towards the Soviet people. I will tell the Soviet people all of this.

    I had very pleasant talks with President Eisenhower. On all the issues we discussed, whether it was the assessment of the situation or the need to improve relations between our two countries, we had many common understandings.

    As you yourselves know, it is not easy to overcome everything accumulated during years of the "Cold War." How many speeches have been made in the past that not only did not help improve relations but made them even more tense. Therefore, one cannot expect a sudden turnaround in the situation. The process of improving relations between our two countries requires great effort and patience, and first and foremost, it requires both sides to have the desire to create conditions that will transform the current state of tension into normal relations, and then into friendship, to the benefit of consolidating world peace.

    The Soviet Union—which I represent, its government and people—is guided by the interests of consolidating peace and friendship among all peoples. We have always done and continue to do our best to eliminate the "Cold War" and improve relations between our two countries.

    I have no doubt that Mr. President sincerely hopes to improve relations between our two countries. I feel that the American President's environment is more complex than mine. It is clear that there are powerful forces in the United States that hinder the improvement of relations between our two countries and obstruct the relaxation of the international situation. This cannot be ignored. But I think that healthy reason will eventually make people understand the correct direction for resolving international problems. And this only correct direction is to eliminate the "Cold War" and consolidate world peace.

    However, eliminating international tension does not depend solely on the efforts of two countries. To achieve this, the willingness and efforts of all countries are needed.

    The Soviet Union's disarmament proposals have attracted the attention of countries around the world. It is hoped that the U.S. government will overcome deep-seated prejudices and work with all countries to find the right way to solve the disarmament problem.

    As long as the two most powerful countries are at odds with each other, there can be no stability and tranquility in the world.

    Imagine such a scene: There are two neighbors. Neither likes the rules and lifestyle of the other's family. So, they separate themselves with a wall, and both families curse each other day and night, inside and outside. Is it good to be neighbors like this? Everyone would say: No. Because sooner or later, this will lead to a fight.

    If neighbors are not harmonious, there is still a way out: one of them can sell the house and move elsewhere. But what about two countries? After all, countries cannot move elsewhere! Where exactly is the way out?

    Here you have capitalism, and there we have socialism. So what do we do? Do we start a worldwide fight, or do we establish normal relations, coexist peacefully, and let each person live their own way? In the Soviet Union, everyone advocates living in peace and coexisting peacefully.

    Have you considered this question: If we and you do not want to fight, why do you and we need so many armaments? Someone told me that your country's military spending averages more than $40 billion a year. And what about us? We don't need to hide it, we allocate $25 billion a year for the same purpose. Can't better uses be found for the people's money?

    Of course, no country would dare to disarm easily if it is not sure whether other countries will also disarm. Everyone is afraid of being invaded by others.

    You probably know that a week ago, the Soviet government submitted to the United Nations a proposal for complete and thorough disarmament and the establishment of strict, all-encompassing supervision. What are we proposing? It is the complete abolition of all armies, the destruction of all weapons, including atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons. Leaving each country only with a strictly limited number of police forces equipped with light firearms. If our counterparts do not agree to such far-reaching measures, then, as a start, we are willing to reach an agreement on measures for gradual disarmament.

    We are very pleased to see that many national leaders and political activists are paying close attention to our proposals, and they themselves are also taking measures to reach the necessary agreements on disarmament. Regrettably, there are still people holding on to the rhetoric of the "Cold War." We hope that the U.S. government and the governments of other countries will correctly understand our peace proposals and take corresponding measures in this regard.

    In my talks with your President, we discussed this issue in detail. The President, like us, is anxious about the failure to eliminate the fervor for armament. I return home with the hope that the U.S. government will overcome deep-seated prejudices and that we will sooner or later find the right way to solve the disarmament problem together with all countries.

    We also discussed other mature issues, and there are many such issues today. Let's first talk about the problem of eliminating the remnants of World War II. Many people ask: Why is the issue of eliminating the remnants of World War II so unsettling for the Soviet Union? You know this is an old problem. I will tell you frankly—we are not afraid of German militarism, but we are very familiar with their conspiratorial habits and temperament. The failure to conclude a peace treaty creates an atmosphere that allows revanchist sentiments to rise. I hope you can understand what I mean: if you want peace, you cannot retain the remnants of war.

    The Soviet Union has proposed to finally end World War II. This can and must be done by concluding a peace treaty with Germany.

    Sometimes people object to our views by saying: Since Germany was a unified country when it fought in the war, then the peace treaty can only be concluded after Germany is unified. But everyone is very clear that there are currently two Germanys in reality, and they each live in their own way. Neither of these two Germanys is willing to give up its social system, so we should not use force to force one Germany to surrender to the other! Let the Germans themselves negotiate how to live and how to establish mutual relations.

    Wouldn't it be better to conclude peace treaties with the two Germanys without delay, thereby extinguishing the sparks in the ashes to avoid a new fire? Concluding a peace treaty with Germany can also extinguish the embers smoldering in West Berlin, thereby creating a normal situation.

    The issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, like the issue of disarmament, is not one that can be easily resolved. Precisely because these are difficult issues, they must be resolved and not shelved.

    The Soviet Union's national, economic, and social structure is the most just and advanced. The Soviet Union advocates that the issue of social and state systems must strictly adhere to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.

    During my short stay in your country, I have learned as much as possible about the lives of the American people and have seen and heard many things.

    I am very grateful for the warm hospitality shown to me—the head of the Soviet government—and my accompanying comrades. We are even more convinced that the American people want to be friendly with our people, love peace, and love their country. The American people have created a great deal of wealth and have a very high standard of living. The Soviet people, like you, also love their country, want peace, and want to be friendly with your people and with the people of all countries in the world.

    Thanks to the victory of socialism, the Soviet people have made great achievements. Although we are not as wealthy as you now, we are advancing along a reliable path to achieve the highest standard of living.

    The issue of social and state systems, that is, whether to live under socialism or under capitalism, is the internal affair of each country and must strictly adhere to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.

    If all countries abide by these principles, then there will be no particular difficulty in ensuring peace among all peoples. In order to live in peace, we must better understand each other. Please allow me to briefly talk about our country, people's lives, and future plans. If I say that the impressions I have gained here, and even the things I like here, cannot shake my belief that the Soviet Union's national, economic, and social structure is the most just and advanced, then I hope you can understand me.

    The Soviet Union is a country of working people. We have no capitalists. Our factories are the property of the whole people. All the land and resources belong to the people. Farmers collectively operate on this land. Everyone's income depends on their own labor, not on the capital invested.

    Under the socialist system, the remuneration for each worker depends on the quantity and quality of the labor he performs for the welfare of society. When our production is more developed, when we accumulate more wealth, we will transition to the communist distribution system: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.

    Our country's constitution is truly the most democratic constitution. It guarantees the election of legislative bodies through universal, equal, direct, and secret elections. It guarantees the right to work, the right to education, and the right to rest.

    Before the revolution, our situation was: whoever had capital was the smart one. For the first time in history, we established the principle of justice in our own country—whoever works well is famous in society.

    Take the members of the highest state power organ of the Soviet Union—the members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union—as an example. There are a total of 1,378 representatives elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, of whom 366 are women. More than 1,000 representatives are directly engaged in industrial and agricultural production; these are workers, engineers, collective farmers, and agronomists.

    The remaining representatives are state activists and social activists, scientific, cultural, and literary workers, teachers, and doctors. You see, there are no capitalists in our country, and there are no representatives of them in the Supreme Soviet. In our government, there are people from the working people.

    Take myself as an example: my grandfather was an illiterate serf. He was the property of the landlord, could be sold at will, and could even be exchanged for a dog—this was common. My father was a miner, and I myself worked as a fitter in the mine. I participated in the civil war, and later the Soviet regime sent me to a workers' school to study, and then to an industrial college. Now, the people have entrusted me with the lofty position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers. My two First Deputy Chairmen—Anastas Mikoyan and Frol Kozlov—visited you here not long ago.

    Who are they? Anastas Mikoyan is the son of a carpenter, and Frol Kozlov is the son of a blacksmith, and he himself was a worker, and later became an engineer. In our country, property and positions are not inherited. In Soviet society, everyone truly enjoys freedom.

    The only freedom that the Soviet Union does not have is the freedom to exploit the labor of others. The socialist system affirms the most humane and truly just social relations. Religious people, if they truly follow the principles of universal peace and love for others, should not oppose the new socialist system.

    The only freedom we don't have is the freedom to exploit the labor of others, the freedom to privately own factories and banks.

    Our older generation began life under capitalism. But why do we think the path of socialism is a more just path? For thousands of years, mankind has been developing under the condition that a few people occupy the wealth created by the majority. People are always looking for a better way to build society in order to eliminate the phenomenon of man exploiting man.

    We thank Marx, Engels, and Lenin because they opened the road to this society, and we have embarked on this road. The people of many countries in Europe and Asia have also followed us on this road. After the working people took power into their own hands, they eradicated the desire to get rich by exploiting others. You know, human greed is a terrible thing. Would there be any millionaire who would not want to become a billionaire?

    I hope you understand my words correctly. It's one thing when a person has a pair of shoes, he wants to have two pairs, three pairs; he has a suit of clothes and he wants to have several suits; when he has a house, he wants to build a more beautiful house for himself. This is a reasonable desire. Socialism does not limit people's tastes and demands. But it is quite another thing if a person has a factory and wants to have two, and when he already has one factory, he wants to get ten factories. It is obvious that no matter who it is, if he works on his own, then even if you add the whole family, even if he lives more than one lifetime, it is impossible to earn a million dollars, let alone ten billion dollars. Such money can only be obtained by relying on the labor of others. But you know, this goes against one's conscience. Everyone knows that there are also these words in the Bible: If merchants turn the church into a house of usury, changing its nature, Jesus will pick up the whip and drive them away. Therefore, religious people, if they proceed from their own morals and follow the principles of universal peace and love for others, then they should not oppose the new socialist system. Because this system affirms the most humane and truly just social relations.

    In order for you to understand why we are so proud of the Soviet state, I must tell you something about our situation before the revolution. The life of the people at that time was very difficult, almost 80% of the people were illiterate, and hunger and disease took the lives of millions of people.

     Now you will better understand why the Soviet people are so happy that their country has become the second industrial power in the world in such a short period of time. We have increased our industrial output thirty-five times, eliminated illiteracy, and now we train almost twice as many engineers as the United States.

    The speed of Soviet industrial development far exceeds that of the United States, and in the next ten to twelve years, it will surpass the United States in terms of both absolute industrial output and per capita output.

    If we had not spent almost half of the forty years on wars that were imposed on us, and on the post-war restoration of the national economy, the lives of our people would be better today.

    Do you know that during the war, the German fascist invaders destroyed and burned 1,710 towns and more than 70,000 villages, leaving about 25 million people homeless? We sacrificed several million people, and the material losses were nearly $500 billion.

    If we had not suffered such staggering destruction and losses, we would probably have caught up with the United States in terms of production and people's living standards.

    Now, our people are working hard to complete the Seven-Year Plan. During the Seven-Year Plan, we will double the output of industrial products. During this period, we will invest the equivalent of US$750 billion in the national economy.

    The United States is currently the most economically developed country. Your country's indicators are the highest point in the capitalist world. But, please note that the average annual growth rate of Soviet industry is two to four times faster than yours. Therefore, in the next ten to twelve years, we will surpass the United States in terms of both absolute industrial output and per capita output. And in agriculture, this task will be completed much sooner.

    Our country is building houses on a large scale. For example, in Moscow, the housing built in the last eight years alone is more than what was built in the eight hundred years before the revolution. Next year, the total area of housing that Muscovites will receive will exceed one-quarter of the total area of housing in our capital before the revolution. In the next seven years, we will build nearly 15 million houses in cities and 7 million houses in rural areas. This is equivalent to the emergence of fifty cities like San Francisco. It is also very important that our rent is the lowest in the world, accounting for only 4% to 5% of each family's expenditure.

    We care about having more well-equipped homes so that Soviet people can get more good consumer goods. We mean what we say. In the last six years, our agriculture has sold twice as much meat and more than doubled the amount of milk to urban residents.

    In the near future, we will no longer, I repeat, no longer levy any taxes on residents. I think you clearly understand the significance of this measure.

    The Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the trade unions have always cared about the welfare of all Soviet people.

    Soviet people no longer worry about unemployment. In our Soviet Union, it is not people looking for work, but work looking for people.

    All our children are studying, and in the Soviet Union, not only secondary education but also higher education is free. University students will receive state scholarships. We attach great importance to the education of children. Nurseries, kindergartens, enjoying full public funding in schools, and then going into life—this is a bright road prepared for the growing generation.

    The superiority of the Soviet education system is well known. The Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers trained by Soviet schools shocked the world with the first artificial earth satellites. We are proud that the Russian words "satellite" and "sputnik" do not need to be translated, and the whole world understands them.

    Two million teachers and nearly 400,000 doctors are working for the welfare of the Soviet people.

    We care about the health of our people, our morbidity rate has been greatly reduced, and the mortality rate is the lowest in the world. Every employee has a paid holiday every year. The best sanatoriums, resorts, and rest homes are provided for working people to take vacations. Treatment for all people there is free—small surgeries and the most complex surgeries do not require patients to spend a penny. You often do not understand some aspects of our way of life. And the Soviet people do not understand how there can be such a thing: if there is misfortune in the family, someone suffers from a serious illness, and needs surgery or hospitalization, for which money must be spent; what if there is no money? Lie down and wait to die?

    In our place, when a person is sick and cannot work, his salary is still paid. And when he is old, he will not feel like an unwanted person, the state's pension ensures his life. Farmers have pensions borne by their own cooperatives to ensure their lives without worry.

    You may ask: Is everything so good and smooth in your place? Unfortunately, no, we also have our own difficulties, shortcomings, and unresolved problems. I can say with great confidence that we ourselves, the Soviet people, are the most critical and uncompromising in criticizing these shortcomings.

    The mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States are regarded by the people of all countries as the beginning of a joint effort to seek a path to Soviet-American rapprochement and strengthening peace.

    Dear American citizens! In a few hours, our plane will fly away from the land of the United States. I would like to thank once again the American people, President Eisenhower, and the American government for their hospitality and the friendly feelings they have shown to us. I will bring the friendly feelings and warm hospitality shown to me, the head of the Soviet government, to our people.

    During these days of my stay in your country, I have received thousands of letters and telegrams from American citizens expressing their wishes. They express friendly feelings towards the Soviet people. Many people invited me and my comrades to visit their homes and meet their families and children. I would like to go anywhere I am invited, but, regrettably, this is not possible. To do this, I would have to stay in your country for a long time. As you know, I cannot stay here for a long time. Please allow me to sincerely thank those who have extended friendly invitations to us and those who have shown friendly feelings to us.

    Finally, let me wish the American people prosperity and happiness, and hope that our visit to the United States and President Eisenhower's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union will be regarded not only by the Soviet and American peoples, but also by the people of all countries in the world, as a joint effort to seek a path to the rapprochement of our two countries and a path to strengthening universal peace.

    Goodbye, I wish you all the best, friends!
                        (The intertitle within the text is added by the editor of this newspaper)

    赫鲁晓夫离美前在华盛顿发表电视演说
    希望苏美共同努力加强和平
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社华盛顿27日电：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫9月27日在华盛顿发表了电视演说，全文如下：
    美国朋友们，晚安！
    我在回国之前有机会和你们谈谈，我感到很高兴。我们喜欢你们美丽的城市、出色的道路，而主要的是恳切而善意的人们。希望我的话不致被理解为客人对主人表示礼貌和尊敬的客套。
    到过苏联的人大概谈过苏联人民对你们所抱的深切的善意和他们要同你们和平友好相处的愿望。现在我将带着这样的信心回国：你们对苏联人民也怀着这种感情。我将把这一切告诉苏联人民。
    我同艾森豪威尔总统进行了十分愉快的会谈。在我们会谈所涉及的一切问题上，无论是对局势的估计，还是在必须改善我们两国之间的关系方面，我们都有许多共同的了解。
    你们自己也知道，多年“冷战”所积累起来的一切不是那么容易克服的。过去发表过多少次演说，但是不仅无助于改善关系，反而使关系更加紧张了。因此，不能指望局势会有突然的转变。改善我们两国关系的过程要求作出巨大的努力和耐心，而首先是要求这一方和另一方都要有愿望来创造条件，促使目前紧张状态变成正常关系，然后转化为友谊，以有利于巩固世界和平。
    苏联——我代表它的政府和人民——所遵循的是巩固各国人民之间的和平与友谊的利益。我们过去和现在一向是尽全力消除“冷战”，改善我们两国的关系。
    我一点也不怀疑，总统先生诚心希望改善我们两国的关系。我感觉，美国总统的环境比我复杂。很明显，在美国阻碍改善我们两国的关系、阻挠国际局势缓和的力量是有势力的。这一点是不能不考虑到的。但是我想，健康的理智终于会使人理解到解决国际问题的正确方向。而这种唯一正确的方向便是消除“冷战”，巩固世界和平。
    不过，消除国际紧张局势并不仅仅取决于两个国家的努力。要做到这一点，还需要一切国家的意愿和努力。
    苏联提出的裁军建议引起世界各国的注意。希望美国政府克服根深蒂固的成见，同各国一起找到解决裁军问题的正确方法。
    只要两个最强大的国家彼此不睦，世界上是不可能有稳定和安宁的。
    请设想这样一幅景象：有两家邻居。彼此都不喜欢对方家里的规矩和生活方式。于是，他们便用围墙隔开来，并且双方一家内外互相昼夜骂个不停。这样做邻居好不好呢？每个人都会说：不好。因为这样下去早晚会打起架来。
    邻居不和睦，毕竟还有个出路：其中的一家可以卖掉房子，迁居别处。可是两个国家怎么办呢？要知道，国家是不可能迁到别处去的！出路究竟何在呢？
    你们这里是资本主义，我们那里是社会主义。那我们怎么办呢？是由此掀起全世界的殴斗呢，还是建立正常关系，和平共处，各人都按自己的方式过日子呢？在苏联，所有人都主张过和平日子，都主张和平共处。
    你们是否考虑过这样一个问题：如果我们和你们都不想打仗，你们和我们何必需要这样多的军备？有人对我说，贵国的军费平均每年在四百亿美元以上。而我们呢？不必隐瞒，我们为了同一目的每年拨款二百五十亿美元。难道不能够为人民的金钱找到更好的用途吗？
    当然，任何一个国家，如果对别国是否也会裁军没有把握的话，那它是不敢轻易裁军的。谁都害怕别人来侵犯自己。
    你们大概知道，在一周以前苏联政府曾经向联合国提出了进行全面彻底的裁军并建立严格的无所不包的监督的建议。我们所建议的是什么呢？是完全取消一切军队，是销毁各种武器，其中包括原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器。给各国只留下数量有严格限制的配备轻射击武器的警察部队。如果我们的对方不同意这样深远的措施，那么，我们为了开个头，愿意就逐步裁军的措施达成协议。
    我们很高兴地看到，许多国家领导人和政治活动家非常注意我们的建议，而且他们自己也在采取措施以求在裁军方面达成必要的协议。令人遗憾的是，还有人持着“冷战”时期的论调。我们希望，美国政府和其他国家的政府正确地了解我们的和平建议，并且自己也在这方面采取相应的措施。
    在同你们的总统会谈时，我们详细地讨论了这个问题。总统像我们一样，对没有能消灭搞军备的狂热感到焦虑。我在回国时抱着希望，希望美国政府能够克服根深蒂固的成见，希望我们早晚将同所有国家一起找到解决裁军问题的正确方法。
    我们还讨论了其他成熟了的问题，当今这样的问题很多。先谈谈消灭第二次世界大战残余的问题。许多人问：为什么消灭第二次世界大战残余的问题使苏联如此不安？要知道这是老问题了。我直截了当地对你们说——我们不怕德国军国主义，可是我们很熟悉他们阴谋的癖性和脾气。由于没有缔结和约，就造成一种让复仇情绪抬头的气氛。我希望你们能理解我的意思：如果希望和平，就不能保留战争残余。
    苏联曾建议最终结束第二次世界大战。可以和必须通过缔结对德和约做到这点。
    有时有人反对我们的意见说：既然同德国作战的时候德国是一个统一的国家，那么和约也只能在德国统一以后缔结。可是大家都很清楚，目前实际上存在着两个德国，它们各自按自己的方式生活。这两个德国都不愿放弃自己的社会制度，那末我们就不应用武力迫使一个德国向另一个国家投降！让德国人自己来谈判该怎样生活，怎样建立互相关系吧。
    不再拖延地同两个德国缔结和约，从而扑灭灰烬中的火星，以免酿成新的火灾，这样做不是更好一些吗？缔结对德和约还能扑灭在西柏林隐隐燃烧的火星，从而创立正常的局面。
    缔结对德和约问题和裁军问题一样，都不是能轻易解决的问题。正因为这是一些困难的问题，所以必须加以解决而不能束之高阁。
    苏联的国家、经济和社会结构是最公正、最先进的。苏联主张关于社会制度和国家制度的问题必须严格遵循互不干涉内政的原则。
    我在贵国这样短短的期间内，尽我所能地了解了美国人民的生活，看到和听到了许多东西。
    我非常感谢大家对我——苏联政府首脑和我的随行同志所表现的隆情盛意。我们更加相信，美国人民是希望同我国人民友好的，是热爱和平，热爱自己的祖国的。美国人民创造了大量的财富，有着很高的生活水平。苏联人民像你们一样，也热爱自己的祖国，希望和平，希望同贵国人民以及同世界各国人民友好相处。
    由于社会主义的胜利，苏联人民取得了很大的成就。虽然我们现在还不像你们那么富裕，但是我们正沿着可靠的道路向求得最高的生活水平前进。
    关于社会制度和国家制度的问题，即关于在社会主义下生活还是在资本主义下生活的问题，这是每一个国家的内部事务，必须严格遵循互不干涉内政的原则。
    如果所有国家都将遵守这些原则，那末，保障各国人民之间的和平就没有特别的困难了。为了和平相处，必须更好地相互了解。请允许我简单地谈谈我们的国家，人们的生活，未来的计划。如果我说，我从这里所得到的印象，甚至你们这里使我喜欢的东西并不能动摇我的这种信念：苏联的国家、经济和社会结构是最公正的、最先进的；那么，我希望你们能够了解我。
    苏联是劳动人民的国家。我们没有资本家。我们的工厂是全民的财产。全部的土地和资源都属于人民。农民在这块土地上进行集体经营。每一个人的收入都是取决于自己的劳动，而不是取决于所投入的资本。
    在社会主义制度下，对每一个工作者的报酬取决于他为社会福利所进行的劳动的数量和质量。当我们的生产更加发达的时候，当我们积累的财富更多的时候，我们就将过渡到共产主义的分配制度：各尽所能，按需享用。
    我们国家的宪法是真正最民主的宪法。它保证用普遍、平等、直接和秘密的选举方式选举立法机关。它保证了劳动权、学习权和休息权。
    革命前，我们的情况是：谁有资本，谁就是聪明人。我们在历史上第一次在自己的国土上确立了公正的原则——谁劳动得好，谁就在社会上有名望。
    就拿苏联最高国家权力机关——苏联最高苏维埃的成员作例子吧。选入苏联最高苏维埃的共有一千三百七十八位代表，其中有三百六十六位代表是妇女。一千多位代表直接从事工业和农业生产，这些是工人、工程师、集体农民、农艺师。
    其余的代表是国家活动家和社会活动家，科学、文化和文艺工作人员，教师和医生。你们看，我们国内没有资本家，最高苏维埃也没有他们的代表。在我们政府里是来自劳动人民的人。
    拿我自己来说：我的祖父是不识字的农奴。他是地主的财产，可以被任意卖掉，甚至可以拿去换狗——这种事是常有的。我的父亲是一个矿工，我本人也在矿井里当过钳工。我参加过国内战争，后来苏维埃政权送我进工人学校学习，随后进了工业学院。现在，人民把部长会议主席这个崇高的职位委托给我。我的两位第一副主席——阿纳斯塔斯·米高扬和弗罗尔·科兹洛夫不久前到你们这里访问过。
    他们是什么人呢？阿纳斯塔斯·米高扬是木匠的儿子，弗罗尔·科兹洛夫是铁匠的儿子，他本人也是工人，后来当了工程师。在我们国家里，财产和职位都是不能继承的。在苏维埃社会里，人人都真正地享有自由。
    苏联所没有的唯一的自由，就是剥削他人劳动的自由。社会主义制度肯定了最人道的、真正公正的社会关系。信教的人如果真正遵循普世和平和爱他人的原则，就不应该反对新的社会主义制度。
    我们所没有的唯一的自由，就是剥削他人劳动的自由，私人占有工厂和银行的自由。
    我们这老一辈的人是在资本主义条件下开始了生活的。但是为什么我们认为社会主义的道路是比较公正的道路呢？千百年来，人类一直是在少数人占有多数人创造的财富的条件下发展的。人们总是寻找着较好的建设社会的方式以便消除人剥削人的现象。
    我们感谢马克思、恩格斯、列宁，因为他们开辟了通往这个社会的道路，而我们走上了这条道路。欧洲和亚洲许多国家的人民也跟着我们走上了这条道路。劳动人民把政权掌握在自己的手中以后，根除了想依靠剥削别人发财致富的欲望。要知道，人的贪欲是一种可怕的东西。难道会有哪一个百万富翁不愿意成为亿万富翁吗？
    我希望你们正确理解我的话。一个人有了一双鞋子，他希望再有两双，三双；他有了一套衣服还希望有几套；他有了一所房子的时候，还想为自己盖一所更漂亮的房子；这是一回事。这是一种合理的愿望。社会主义不限制人们的口味和要求。但是，如果一个人有了一个工厂又想要有两个，当他已得到一个工厂的时候还想得到十个工厂，这就完全是另回事了。很明显，无论哪一个人，如果他亲自劳动的话，那末即使把全家人加在一起，即使他不止活一辈子，也不可能赚到一百万块钱，更谈不上十亿块钱了。这样一些钱只有依靠别人的劳动才能得到。不过要知道，这是违背人的良心的。大家知道，在圣经上也有这样的话：如果商人把教堂变成了重利盘剥者之家，把它变了样，耶稣就会拿起鞭子，把他们赶走。因此，信教的人如果从自己的道义出发并遵循普世和平和爱他人的原则，那么他们就不应该反对新的社会主义制度。因为这个制度肯定了最人道的、真正公正的社会关系。
    为了使你们了解，我们为什么为苏维埃国家感到如此骄傲，必须对你们讲一讲我们在革命前的一些情况。人民在当时的生活是非常艰难的，几乎80％的人是文盲，饥饿和疾病夺取了千千万万人的生命。
     现在你们会更好的了解，苏联人为什么对他们的祖国在短短的时期内变成了世界上第二个工业强国感到那么欢欣鼓舞。我们使我们的工业产量增加了三十五倍，消灭了文盲，现在我们培养的工程师差不多比美国多两倍。
    苏联工业发展速度大大超过美国，今后十至十二年内将在工业绝对产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面都超过美国。
    如果我们没有把四十年中几乎一半的时间花在强加给我们的战争上，和花在战后国民经济的恢复上，我国人民的生活今天就会更好。
    你们知道吗，在战争期间，德国法西斯侵略者毁坏和烧掉了一千七百一十个城镇和七万多个村庄，使大约两千五百万人无家可归。我们牺牲了好几百万人，物质损失将近五千亿美元。
    要不是遭受这样惊人的破坏和损失，我们大概已经在生产量和人民生活水平方面赶上了美国。
    现在，我国人民正在为完成七年计划而努力。在七年计划期间，我们将把工业品的产量增加一倍。我们在这个期间要向国民经济投资相当于贵国货币的七千五百亿美元。
    美国目前是在经济方面最发达的国家。你们国家的指标是资本主义世界的最高点。可是，请注意，苏联工业每年平均增长速度比你们的快二至四倍。因此，在今后的十年至十二年中，我们将在工业的绝对产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面都将超过美国。而在农业方面，将要大大提前完成这一任务。
    我国正在大兴土木建造住宅。例如，在莫斯科，仅仅最近八年所建造的住房就比革命前八百年中所建造的还要多。明年，莫斯科人得到的住宅总面积将超过革命前我国首都住宅总面积的四分之一。在未来的七年中，我们将在城市建筑将近一千五百万套住宅，在农村建筑七百万所住房。这等于将出现五十来个像旧金山这样的城市。有一点也是很重要的：我们的房租是世界上最低的，它只占每个家庭支出的4％到5％。
    我们关心的是，有更多设备完善的住宅，使苏联人得到更多的好消费品。我们是说到就做到。在最近六年中，我们的农业向城市居民出售的肉类增加了两倍；奶类增加一倍多。
    最近期间，我们就将不再，再说一遍，将不再向居民征收一切税收。我想你们清楚了解这个措施的意义。
    共产党、苏联政府、工会一直关心着全体苏联人民的福利。
    苏联人不再为失业这种现象担忧。在我们苏联，不是人找工作，而 是工作找人。
    我们所有的儿童都在学习，在苏联，不仅中等教育，而且高等教育也是免费的。大学生将领到国家的奖学金。我们对儿童的教育是非常重视的。托儿所、幼儿园、在学校里享受全部公费，然后走向生活——这是为正在成长的一代准备好的光明道路。
    苏联教育制度的优越是众所周知的。苏联学校培养出来的苏联科学家、工程师、技术员和工人用第一批人造地球卫星震惊了全世界。我们感到自豪的是，俄文字“卫星”和“小月亮”不要翻译，全世界就都懂。
    二百万的教师和将近四十万的医生在为苏联人民谋福利。
    我们关心我国人民的健康，我们的生病率大大减少了，而死亡率是世界上最低的。每个职工每年都有工资照付的假日。最好的疗养院、避暑地和休养所都是供给劳动人民休假用的。我们那里给所有的人治病都是免费的——小手术和最复杂的手术都不需要病人花一点钱。你们对我国生活方式的某些方面往往是不理解的。而苏联人不理解，怎么会有这样的事：假如家中遇到不幸，某人患了重病，需要动手术或者住院治疗，为此必须花钱；要是没有钱呢？躺着等死吗？
    在我们那里，当一个人生病不能工作时，他的工资仍然照发。而在他年老的时候，他不会感到自己是个没人要的人，国家的养老金使他的生活有保障。农民有自己的合作社负担的养老金使他生活无虑。
    你们可能要问：难道你们那儿一切都那么美好和顺利吗？遗憾的是，不是，我们也有自己的困难、缺点和未解决的问题。我可以很有把握地对你们说，我们自己、苏维埃人是批评这些缺点最尖锐和最不妥协的人。
    希望苏美首脑互相访问被各国人民看作是共同
    努力寻求通往苏美接近和加强和平的道路的开端。
    敬爱的美国公民！再过几小时，我们的飞机就将飞离美国的国土了。我愿再一次感谢美国人民、艾森豪威尔总统和美国政府，感谢他们的款待和对我们表示的友好感情。我将把对我、苏联政府首脑表示的友好感情和盛意带给我国人民。
    我在你们国家逗留的这些日子里收到了美国公民给我的数千封表示祝愿的信和电报。其中表现了对苏联人民的友好感情。许多人邀请我和我的同志去访问他们的家庭，同他们的家人和孩子们见面。我愿意到任何邀请我去的地方，但是，很遗憾，这是不可能的。要做到这一点我必须在贵国耽搁很长时间。正如你们所知道的，我不能在这里逗留很长时间。请允许我向那些对我们发出友好邀请的人，向那些对我们表示友好感情的人真诚道谢。
    最后，让我祝美国人民繁荣和幸福，并希望：我们在美国的访问以及艾森豪威尔总统即将去苏联的访问将不仅被苏联人民和美国人民，而且被全世界各国人民看作是共同努力寻求通往我们两国接近的道路、通往加强普遍和平的道路的开端。
    再见，祝你们一切都好，朋友们！
