    On the Experience of Summarizing Experience
    Thoughts on Studying the Documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee Sha Ying
    No matter what work you do, you must frequently summarize your experience. In particular, the implementation of the Party's line, principles, and policies, the implementation of the state's national economic plan, and the progress of various construction undertakings should be checked and summarized regularly. "Practice is the criterion of truth." In the process of practice, whether our various principles and policies are correct, what achievements we have made in our work, what shortcomings and difficulties we have encountered, what are the reasons for these shortcomings and difficulties, and how to overcome them, etc., can only be confirmed by checking and summarizing our experiences, drawing lessons, strengthening our confidence, correcting our shortcomings, and thereby leading the masses to continue to forge ahead and strive for more and greater achievements. Our various tasks have been improved by constantly summarizing experience. Our various guidelines, policies and plans have become increasingly perfect by constantly summarizing experience. Marxist-Leninist theory has also been enriched and developed by constantly summarizing experience.
    Since summarizing experience is so important, how should we go about summarizing experience?
    It is best to illustrate this with concrete examples.
    Since 1958, this has been a very extraordinary time! Our Party put forward the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Hundreds of millions of people across the country launched an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in a vigorous manner, and the brand-new thing of the People's Commune appeared on the eastern horizon of Asia like a rising sun. How should we evaluate these most eye-catching and controversial things of our time? How should we summarize them?
    Recently, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, chaired by Comrade Mao Zedong, conducted a serious review and summary of these issues. The Party Central Committee believes that the Party's General Line and a set of "walking on two legs" policies are completely correct, and it is playing its power greater and greater; Under the guidance of the General Line, fully mobilize the masses, and through vigorous mass movements, the Great Leap Forward achieved by the Chinese people in 1958 was a great and unprecedented achievement. The economic situation in 1959 was also good, and it can continue to leap forward; The new People's Commune has a vigorous vitality and unparalleled superiority. After a period of rectification, it has firmly established its foothold and is developing healthily. In the future, it will increasingly show its great role in developing the productive forces. At the same time, it also pointed out that in the process of advancement, due to our lack of experience, some temporary and local shortcomings also occurred, and some difficulties were inevitably encountered, but these shortcomings, compared with the achievements, are only a matter of one finger versus nine fingers, and under the close leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, these shortcomings and difficulties have been rapidly overcome or are being actively overcome. Based on such analysis and summary, the Party believes that the future is infinitely bright, and it proposes to further launch a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, calling on the people of the whole country to strive to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year. Look, this is how our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong summarize experience. It is full of realistic scientific analysis, fully in line with objective reality, contains infinite revolutionary enthusiasm, gives a high evaluation to the great creation of the people, and can fully encourage the subjective initiative and pioneering spirit of the people. This is truly a brilliant example of summarizing experience! It embodies the firm stand of the working class and the scientific viewpoint and method of Marxism-Leninism. Only mature Marxists-Leninists can set such an example! This example of summarizing experience is worthy of our serious consideration and study.
    In addition, there are some people who are also "summarizing" "experience" in this regard. Contrary to the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, they underestimated the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement achieved by hundreds of millions of people in our country last year, overestimated some of the shortcomings that have been rapidly overcome, and described the mass movement of steelmaking as "not worth the loss" and "more loss than gain," believing that the People's Commune "lacks an objective material basis," "it is only the product of the subjective wishes of a few people," "it was hyped up!" and "it was messed up!" They even described the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement as a manifestation of "petty-bourgeois frenzy" and "left-leaning adventurism," and so on. In this way, they are actually negating the Party's General Line, portraying the domestic situation as "pitch black," pessimistic and frustrated, and the future is bleak!
    This is the estimation of the domestic situation since 1958 by a small handful of right-leaning opportunists. This is the conclusion they reached in "summarizing experience."
    Some people find it very strange that completely opposite conclusions have been drawn from the same objective situation. A sharp opposition has been formed. In fact, it is not strange at all. The reason why the conclusions drawn by the right-leaning opportunists in "summarizing experience" are completely different from the conclusions drawn by the Party Central Committee in summarizing experience is that their stand, world outlook, and methodology are different from those of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. In fact, the right-leaning opportunists are not summarizing experience, but are merely using "summarizing experience" as a guise to distort the facts, reverse right and wrong, create ideological and political confusion, and launch a frenzied attack on the Party and the people's socialist cause! Now, the truth is out, their true colors have been fully exposed, and their conspiracies have completely failed! From the date of the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the people of the whole country warmly support the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, holding high the red flag of the General Line and advancing courageously. The movement to oppose right-leaning and boost enthusiasm for increasing production and practicing economy is surging, iron is flowing everywhere, and steel flowers are splashing. The competition to strive for overproduction of cotton and grain is being carried out in a vigorous manner. The Party's great call has become a huge force, and the magnificent mass movement guarantees the daily increase of various products. This means that the people of the whole country have approved the Party's resolution and countered the attack of the right-leaning opportunists with practical actions. They have failed shamefully!
    Then, what are the reasons for the failure of the right-leaning opportunists? What kind of experience can we gain from the sharp contrast between the two ways of summarizing experience?
    Only when a revolutionary stands firmly on the position of the working class and observes and understands the world with the Marxist dialectical materialist world outlook can the objective world be truly understood; at the same time, use this understanding of the objective world to guide the revolution, to engage in construction, and to summarize experience, this is methodology (or way of thinking). Standpoint, viewpoint, and method are consistent. If there is a problem with the standpoint, and one does not observe things from the standpoint of the working class, it is naturally impossible to have correct viewpoints and methods; if the viewpoints and methods are wrong, and one does not observe things from the Marxist dialectical materialist viewpoints and methods, then one's standpoint cannot be correct. As long as the standpoint, viewpoint, and method are not correct, it is impossible to correctly understand the world, and it is also impossible to correctly summarize experience. The reason why the right-leaning opportunists made extremely absurd conclusions is because they stood on the position of the bourgeoisie instead of the proletariat, and used the subjective idealist and empiricist world outlook and methodology, instead of the Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialist world outlook and methodology to observe problems. Because their starting point is reactionary, their motives are malicious, and their viewpoints and methods are wrong, the conclusions they get from "summarizing experience" are bound to be absurd.
    In the eyes of Marxists, history is created by the people, the people liberate themselves, and the people have infinite creativity. A revolutionary must closely contact the masses, rely on the masses, and stand among the masses, not stand above the masses, in order to lead the masses and help the masses to do it themselves, to strive for and create their own happy life. Therefore, we must respect the masses, respect the mass movement, and respect the creativity and initiative of the masses, so that we can stand in front of them and lead them. Of course, revolution is not embroidery. In mass movements, some deviations and shortcomings are inevitable, but we should not be surprised by this, but should actively help them to correct and overcome them. We must never limit the mass movement according to our own subjective "frameworks" and "scores," or gloat over it and scold them and spread pessimistic and disappointed emotions when we think that the mass movement has gone beyond our "frameworks" and "scores." Even more, we must not stand on the opposite side of them to oppose them and attack their revolutionary enthusiasm. This is the attitude of Marxists towards mass movements. This is what our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong attach great importance to when summarizing experience. But the right-leaning opportunists are not like this. They cannot see the great power of the people. They do not stand in the mass movement, but stand outside the mass movement, adding criticism and accusations, pouring cold water, and slandering the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement as "petty-bourgeois frenzy." They are frightened by some local and temporary difficulties, sink into the quagmire of pessimism, and lose confidence in progress. Therefore, the conclusions they get from "summarizing experience" are bound to be absurd.
    In the eyes of Marxism, the new and progressive things are invincible. When new and progressive things appear, even if they are relatively weak and young, and even if they suffer temporary setbacks, they have strong vitality and a bright future, because they represent the direction of progress and development, are suitable for new historical conditions, and are needed and welcomed by the people. Of course, new things cannot achieve victory spontaneously and freely. The duty of the Communist Party is to see the young shoots of new things in time, and promote their growth with full enthusiasm and active activities, and help them to establish themselves in life and develop healthily. Our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong take this attitude towards new and progressive things. For example, when the People's Commune first appeared among the people, our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly realized that it was a brand-new and progressive thing, and foresaw that it could promote the development of productive forces and was something with a bright future, so they supported it with great enthusiasm and promoted its development; and when some deviations and shortcomings occurred in the process of its growth, they conscientiously helped it to correct the deviations and overcome the shortcomings, so that after several months of rectifying the commune, it firmly established its foothold and embarked on the road of healthy development. This is entirely a Marxist attitude. But the right-leaning opportunists are not like this. With the attitude of bourgeois masters and with empiricist eyes, they turn a blind eye to new things. When the masses are doing it vigorously, they still say "it's too early," "it's too fast," and "it's messed up," panicking like "dogs that have lost their homes"! In this way, they cannot help but fall into a sad situation and cannot extricate themselves. This is the inevitable end of the "man in the case"!
    Marxist dialectics teaches us that we must look at problems objectively and comprehensively, distinguish between the main stream and the branch stream, the essence and the non-essence, and distinguish the relationship between nine fingers and one finger. Never look at problems in isolation and one-sidedly, "seeing the trees but not the forest," attacking one point without considering the rest. When we summarize experience, we often say that achievements are the main ones and shortcomings are the secondary ones. Some people ridicule us: "This is the Communist Party's formula." In fact, in a sense, this is a formula. As long as the Party's line is correct, the revolutionary cause engaged in by hundreds of millions of people and thousands of cadres, and we constantly summarize experience, the result is of course that achievements are the main ones and shortcomings are the secondary ones. Our Party also made such an estimate when summarizing the domestic situation since 1958. Is it not right? Of course, this does not mean that we should not conduct specific analysis when estimating the situation, and it does not mean that we should mechanically apply this formula to every individual unit and every individual leader. The reason why the right-leaning opportunists came to extremely absurd conclusions when "summarizing experience" is because they stood on the wrong position, did not understand materialist dialectics, but used the idealist metaphysical method to observe things, with great subjective one-sidedness, truly "one leaf blinds the eyes, and one cannot see Mount Tai," trying to deny achievements and exaggerate shortcomings, seeing only the branch stream and not the main stream, unable to distinguish the relationship between nine fingers and one finger, and seeing the situation as pitch black. This is one of the reasons why they are unlucky.
    These things seem to be general principles, and even some common political knowledge; but the right-leaning opportunists made great mistakes precisely because they did not understand these common principles, or they understood them in words but did not really understand them in practice. Some comrades with right-leaning emotions and right-leaning thoughts are also not very clear about these principles and cannot stand firm in the great storm. Therefore, it is probably not entirely useless for us to talk about the experience of summarizing experience and arouse people's attention!

    关于总结经验的经验
    学习八届八中全会文件的体会  沙英
    不论做什么工作，都要经常总结经验。特别是党的路线、方针和政策执行的情况，国家的国民经济计划执行的情况及各种建设事业进行的情况，更应当定期地检查和总结。“实践是真理的标准”。在实践的过程中，究竟我们的各种方针政策是不是正确，我们的工作有什么成绩，有什么缺点，有什么困难，产生缺点、困难的原因是什么以及怎样克服，等等，这只有进行检查和总结，才能肯定成绩，吸取经验，坚定信心，改正缺点，从而领导群众继续奋勇前进，争取更多更大的成绩。我们的各种工作都是由于不断总结经验而有所改进。我们的各种方针、政策和计划都是由于不断总结经验而日趋完善。马克思列宁主义的理论也是由于不断总结经验而日益丰富和发展。
    既然总结经验如此之重要，那末应当怎样来进行总结经验呢？
    这最好是用具体的实例来说明。
    1958年以来，这是一个非常不平凡的时期！我们党提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，全国几亿人民轰轰烈烈地发动了史无前例的大跃进，人民公社这个崭新的事物像初升的太阳出现于亚洲东部的地平线上。对于这些当代最引人注目的和议论纷纭的东西，应当怎样估价呢？应当怎样总结呢？
    最近，在毛泽东同志主持下召开的八届八中全会上，对这些问题作了认真地检查和总结。党中央认为：党的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针是完全正确的，它正越来越大的发挥它的威力；在总路线的指导下，充分发动群众，经过轰轰烈烈的群众运动，我国人民在1958年实现的大跃进，成绩是伟大的史无前例的，1959年的经济情况也是良好的，可以继续跃进的；新生的人民公社有旺盛的生命力和无比的优越性，经过一段时间的整顿，已经巩固地站稳了脚根，正在健康地发展，今后将日益显著地发挥它发展生产力的巨大作用。并且同时也指出，在前进的过程中，由于我们经验不足，也产生一些暂时的、局部的缺点，也不可避免地遇到一些困难，不过这些缺点和成绩比较起来，不过是一个指头与九个指头的关系，而且在党和毛泽东同志的密切领导下，已经迅速地克服了或正在努力地克服着这些缺点和困难。在这样分析和总结的基础上，党认为前途是无限光明的，并且提出进一步开展一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，号召全国人民为在今年内提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而斗争。请看，我们党中央和毛泽东同志就是这样总结经验的，充满了实事求是的科学分析，完全符合客观的实际情况，包含着无限的革命热情，对人民群众的伟大创造给予很高的估价，又能充分鼓舞人民群众的主观能动性和首创精神。这真是一个总结经验的光辉的范例！它体现了工人阶级的坚定的立场和马克思列宁主义的科学的观点和方法。只有成熟了的马克思列宁主义者才能作出这样的榜样！这种总结经验的榜样值得我们认真地思考和学习。
    另外，有一种人也在“总结”这一方面的“经验”。他们同党中央和毛泽东同志相反，他们对我国几亿人民去年的大跃进和人民公社运动所取得的伟大成绩估计过低，对已经迅速克服的一些缺点估计过于严重，把大炼钢铁的群众运动说成是“得不偿失”、“有失无得”，认为人民公社“缺乏客观物质基础”，“只是少数人主观愿望的产物”，“是轰起来的”，“搞糟了”！他们甚至把大跃进和人民公社运动说成是“小资产阶级狂热性”的表现，是“左倾冒险主义”，等等。这样，他们实际上就是否定了党的总路线，把国内形势描写成“漆黑一团”，悲观丧气，前途暗淡！
    这就是一小撮右倾机会主义分子对于1958年以来的国内形势的估计，这就是他们“总结经验”的结论。
    有些人觉得很奇怪，对于同样的客观情况，却作出了两种完全相反的结论。形成了一个尖锐的对立面。其实，一点也不奇怪。右倾机会主义分子“总结经验”而得出的结论所以同党中央总结经验得出的结论完全不同，这是因为他们同党中央和毛泽东同志的立场不同，世界观不同，方法论不同。实际上，右倾机会主义分子并不是在总结经验，而只不过是以“总结经验”为幌子，歪曲事实，颠倒是非，制造思想上、政治上的混乱，向党向人民的社会主义事业进行猖狂的进攻！现在，真象大白，他们的原形已经毕露，他们的阴谋诡计已经完全破产了！从八届八中全会的公报和决议公布之日起，全国人民热烈拥护八届八中全会的公报和决议，高举总路线的红旗奋勇前进，反右倾、鼓干劲的增产节约运动风起云涌，到处铁水奔流，钢花飞溅，争取棉粮超产的竞赛轰轰烈烈的开展。党的伟大号召已变成巨大的力量，波澜壮阔的群众运动保证了各种产品的逐日上升。这就是说，全国人民已经用实际行动批准了党的决议和回击了右倾机会主义分子的进攻。他们是可耻地失败了！
    那末，右倾机会主义分子失败的原因是什么呢？我们在两种总结经验的鲜明对照之下可以得到一些什么体会呢？
    一个革命者，只有坚定地站在工人阶级的立场上，用马克思主义的辩证唯物论的世界观去观察和认识世界的时候，客观世界才能如实地被认识；同时，拿这种对于客观世界的认识去指导革命，去从事建设，去总结经验，这就是方法论（或思想方法）。立场、观点和方法是一致的。如果立场有了问题，不是站在工人阶级立场上来观察事物，自然不可能有正确的观点和方法；如果观点和方法错了，不是用马克思主义的辩证唯物论的观点和方法来观察事物，自然他的立场也不可能是正确的。只要立场、观点和方法不对头，那就不可能正确地认识世界，也就不可能正确地总结经验。右倾机会主义分子所以作出极端荒谬的结论，就是因为他们是站在资产阶级立场上而不是站在无产阶级的立场上，是用主观唯心论、经验主义的世界观和方法论，而不是用马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物论的世界观和方法论来观察问题的结果。由于他们的出发点是反动的，动机是恶劣的，观点和方法是错误的，所以他们“总结经验”所得到的结论必然是荒谬的。
    在马克思主义者看来，历史是人民群众创造的，人民群众是自己解放自己，人民群众有无穷无尽的创造力。一个革命者，必须密切联系群众，依靠群众，站在群众之中，不能站在群众之上，才能领导群众，帮助群众自己动手，去争取和创造自己幸福的生活。因此，我们要非常尊重群众，尊重群众运动，尊重群众的创造性和主动性，这样我们才能站在他们的前面领导他们。当然，革命不是绣花，在群众运动中总免不了要出现一些偏差和缺点的，但是我们对此不必大惊小怪，而要积极地帮助他们加以纠正和克服。我们绝不能按照自己主观的“框框”和“谱子”去限制群众运动，或者在一旦认为群众运动越出了自己的“框框”和“谱子”的时候，幸灾乐祸，指手划脚地去责骂他们，散布悲观失望的情绪。更不能站在他们的对面来反对他们，打击他们的革命热情。这就是马克思主义者对待群众运动的态度。这就是我们党和毛泽东同志在总结经验时所十分重视的事情。但是，右倾机会主义者不是这样，他们看不见人民群众伟大的力量，不是站在群众运动之中，而是站在群众运动之外，乱加批评指责，大泼冷水，把大跃进和人民公社运动污蔑为“小资产阶级狂热性”，为一些局部的、暂时的困难所吓倒，陷入悲观主义的泥坑，丧失了前进的信心。因此，他们“总结经验”所得到的结论必然是荒谬的。
    在马克思主义看来，新生的、进步的事物是不可战胜的。当新生的、进步的事物出现的时候，那怕它是比较软弱的、幼小的，甚至还会遭受暂时的挫折，但是它有强大的生命力，前途是光明的，因为它代表着前进的发展方向，适合新的历史条件，为人民群众所需要所欢迎。当然，新生的事物并不能自发地、自流地取得胜利，共产党的职责就在于及时看到新生事物的幼芽，用满腔的热情和积极的活动来促进它的成长，帮助它在生活中站稳脚根和健康地发展。我们党和毛泽东同志对待新生的、进步的事物就是采取这种态度。例如，当人民公社在人民群众中刚一出现的时候，我们党和毛泽东同志就及时地察觉到这是一种崭新的进步的事物，预见到它是能推动生产力的发展的，是有远大前途的东西，于是便热情百倍地支持它、促进它的发展；并且当它在成长的过程中发生一些偏差和缺点的时候，认真地帮助它纠正偏差和克服缺点，于是经过几个月的整社工作，便使它巩固地站稳了脚根，走上了健康发展的道路。这完全是一种马克思主义的态度。但是右倾机会主义者却不是这样，他们以资产阶级老爷式的态度，用经验主义的眼光，对新生的事物熟视无睹，当群众轰轰烈烈地搞起来的时候，还口口声声说“搞早了”、“搞快了”、“搞糟了”，惊惊慌慌有如“丧家之犬”！这样他们就不能不陷入一种可悲的境地而不能自拔。这是“套中人”的必然结局！
    马克思主义的辩证法教导我们说，要客观地全面地看问题，要区别主流和支流、本质和非本质的东西，要分清九个指头和一个指头的关系，千万不要孤立地片面地看问题，“见树不见林”，攻其一点，不计其余。我们在总结经验的时候，常说成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的。有些人便讥讽我们：“这是共产党的公式”。其实，在某种意义上来说，这就是一种公式。只要党的路线是正确的，为几万万人民和成千成万的干部所从事的革命事业，而且又经常总结经验，其结果，成绩当然是主要的，缺点是次要的。我们党在总结1958年以来的国内形势时，也是这样估计的，难道不对吗？当然，这并不是说在估计形势时不要进行具体地分析，也更不等于说在估计某一个别的单位和某一个别的领导者时都机械地按照这个公式来生搬硬套。右倾机会主义者在“总结经验”时所以得出极端荒谬的结论，就是因为他们站在错误的立场，不懂得唯物辩证法，而是用唯心论的形而上学的方法去观察事物，带有极大的主观片面性，真是“一叶障目，不见泰山”，尽量否定成绩，夸大缺点，只见支流不见主流，分不清九个指头与一个指头的关系，把形势看得漆黑一团。这就是他们倒霉的原因之一。
    以上这些，看来是一般的道理，甚至可以说是一些普通的政治常识；但是右倾机会主义者正是因为不懂得这些普通的道理，或者他们口头上懂得但实际上并不真正地懂得，所以他们大错而特错了。一些有右倾情绪、右倾思想的同志，对于这些道理也是不大清楚的，在大风浪中站不稳脚根。因此，我们来谈谈关于总结经验的经验，引起人们的注意，恐怕不是完全无益的吧！
