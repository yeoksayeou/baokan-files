Masses Vigorously Leap Forward, Production Steadily Rises
    Guangdong Appears New Upsurge of Mass Movement
    Provincial Party Committee Calls for Extra Effort to Achieve Grain Production Increase Plan of 35 Billion Jin

    (Our Report) On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a new upsurge of production movement has emerged among the urban and rural people of Guangdong Province. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that now, the task of the Party is to hold even higher the banner of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to oppose right-leaning ideas, to boost morale, and to vigorously carry out mass movements, to resolutely stand at the forefront of the mass movement, and lead the masses to advance bravely. In terms of grain production, it is necessary to lead the masses to make a decisive battle for the late rice management, and strive to harvest dozens or hundreds of jin more per mu. In addition to compensating for all the losses suffered by early rice due to floods, efforts should be made to increase production by 10% compared with last year. In industry, we must strive to overfulfill the revised leap forward targets.

    In order to resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, together with the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, convened a meeting attended by nearly 2,000 cadres at or above the county and regimental level. Party organizations at all levels in the province also held a series of meetings. These meetings unanimously agreed that in early September, a climax of the revolutionary movement of the people on the industrial and agricultural fronts of Guangdong Province appeared. The scale and enthusiasm of this upsurge is in no way inferior to the second half of last year, and some areas have even surpassed the level of the Great Leap Forward last year. Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of workers, poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals are all feeling happy, elated, and daring to despise difficulties. Production targets and production measures have been repeatedly increased. They dare to persist in carrying out technological reform movements; they work hard day and night, conduct large-scale comparisons, large-scale competitions, large-scale collaborations, run experimental fields, and set up camps in the fields. Most rural areas and factories are once again lively and bustling. More than 100,000 cadres eat and live in the fields, plus the masses, a total of more than 300,000 people. The movement of "thousand-jin rice and ten-thousand-jin sweet potatoes" has been widely carried out, and the area of ​​thousand-jin rice in the province has accounted for one-fifth of the total area of ​​late rice. The number of people in the province participating in late rice field management has rapidly increased from more than 4 million to 7-8 million, and labor efficiency has increased to varying degrees. On the other hand, the development speed of agricultural production and industrial production has accelerated. The late rice, which is decisive for the annual grain supply of Guangdong Province, was planted 35 million mu earlier than last year (2 million mu more than last year). Due to timely mid-tilling and topdressing, effective management, and good weather (individual areas suffered floods), tillering was rapid, and each mu has reached an average of about 250,000 seedlings. In late August and early September, several million people launched a blitz to eliminate third-class rice plants. Now the late rice seedlings in the province are growing evenly and vigorously. The planting plan for 10 million mu of autumn sweet potatoes (3 million mu more than last year), which has a great impact on the annual grain production of Guangdong Province, only planted 5-6 million mu by the beginning of August, and then stalled. Some cadres shouted that labor was difficult and could not be completed; but recently, with a burst of energy, several assaults exceeded the planting plan by 850,000 mu. Industrial production has developed even more rapidly. Before August, the monthly growth rate was only a few percent, but in August, pig iron, steel, coal, cement, and machine-made paper all increased by more than 10% compared with July. The first ten days of September were better than August, and the last five days of the first ten days of September were better than the first five days. In other fields such as transportation, commerce, culture and education, good news has also been frequently reported since August.

    The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the revolutionary movement of the people, which continued to develop in the first half of the year, has prepared conditions for this upsurge. Relying on the mass movement, Guangdong Province's industry was able to achieve a tremendous increase compared with the same period last year in the first half of this year, and was able to quickly restore all production under the attack of devastating floods, and achieve a great victory in early rice grain production of more than 9 billion jin.

    The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the current task of the Party lies in making full use of the current upsurge of the mass movement, relying on this movement, developing this movement, strengthening the late rice management, and striving for a bumper harvest, and striving for an all-round leap forward on the entire agricultural front and industrial front. Guangdong Province's grain production this year should increase by 10% compared with last year. Last year, after final verification, it was 32 billion jin, and this year it should be 35 billion jin. This year's early rice suffered from devastating floods and only harvested more than 9 billion jin, which means that the late rice needs to complete 26 billion jin. Whether the task of 35 billion jin can be completed depends on the late rice. The Provincial Party Committee believes that as long as each mu of late rice can harvest an average of 550 jin, the province's plan to increase grain production by 35 billion jin can be completed. This year's late rice has a larger planting area and grows well, and Guangdong's late rice production has always been relatively stable, so as long as thousands of people add more effort and make a concerted effort to grasp the mid-to-late stage management to the end and do a good job in the autumn harvest, it is very hopeful that late rice will achieve a bumper harvest. In October, we must focus on grasping the field management of 10 million mu of autumn sweet potatoes, and grasping the field management of cash crops, especially sugarcane. The task of Guangdong's industrial production in the next few months is also particularly heavy, but since the mass movement has started recently, it has developed rapidly, and the main industrial production indicators will be able to be completed. In the effort to achieve a bumper harvest of late rice, we may also encounter difficulties such as typhoons and lodging; in industrial production, we may also encounter difficulties such as insufficient raw material supply and technical problems. But with a surging mass revolutionary movement, these difficulties will certainly be overcome one by one.

    群众奋勇跃进　生产节节上升
    广东出现群众运动新高潮
    省委号召再加一把劲实现三百五十亿斤粮食的增产计划
    本报讯　建国十周年前夜，广东省城乡人民群众的生产运动出现了新的高潮。中共广东省委指出，现在，党的任务是更高地举起中共八届八中全会反右倾鼓干劲大搞群众运动的旗帜，坚决地站在群众运动的前面，率领群众奋勇前进。在粮食生产方面，要领导群众决战晚稻后期管理，争取每亩多收几十斤、一百斤，除补偿早稻因为水灾遭到的全部损失外，还要力争比去年增产10％；工业上要争取超额完成已修订的各项跃进指标。
    中共广东省委为了坚决贯彻中共中央八届八中全会精神，和人民解放军驻广州部队一起召开了近两千名县级和团级以上干部参加的会议。全省各级党组织也召开了一系列会议。这些会议一致认为，9月上旬广东省工业、农业战线上的人民群众革命运动出现了高潮。这个高潮的规模和热烈程度，丝毫不逊于去年下半年，有些地区已经超过了去年大跃进时的水平。各级党组织和广大工人、贫农、下中农、革命知识分子人人心情舒畅，扬眉吐气，敢于藐视困难，生产指标和生产措施一再加码；敢于坚持开展技术改革运动；苦战夜战、大评比大竞赛大协作、办试验田、田头安营扎寨，大部分农村、工厂又搞得有声有色，热火朝天。干部吃住在田头的有十万多人，加上群众共三十多万人。千斤稻万斤薯运动已广泛开展起来，全省搞千斤稻的面积已占到晚稻总面积的五分之一。全省参加晚稻田间管理的人数，由四百多万人迅速增加到七、八百万人，劳动效率都有不同程度的提高。另一方面，农业生产和工业生产的发展速度加快了。对广东省全年的粮食供应具有决定意义的晚稻，在比去年抢先一个季节插好三千五百万亩（比去年多二百万亩）后，由于中耕、追肥及时，管理得力，风调雨顺（个别地区遭受水灾），分蘖很快，每亩已平均达到二十五万苗左右，8月底9月初有几百万人突击消灭三类禾，现在全省晚稻禾苗生长得又均匀又旺盛。对广东省全年粮食生产有极大影响的一千万亩秋番薯种植计划（比去年多三百万亩），到8月初才种了五、六百万亩，以后一直停滞不前，有些干部喊叫劳力困难，完成不了；但最近一鼓干劲，几个突击，就超额八十五万亩完成了种植计划。工业生产更是突飞猛进，8月以前，每月递增率只有百分之几，但8月份生铁、钢、煤、水泥、机制纸都比7月份增长了10％以上。9月上旬比8月份还好，9月上旬的后五天比前五天更好。其它如交通、商业、文教战线，8月份以来，也捷报频传。
    中共广东省委认为，上半年继续发展着的人民群众革命运动，为这次高潮准备了条件。依靠群众运动，今年上半年广东省的工业才能比去年同期有极大的增长，才能在毁灭性洪水的袭击下，迅速恢复全部生产，使早造粮食生产取得收获九十多亿斤的伟大胜利。
    中共广东省委认为，当前党的任务，就在于充分利用目前高涨的群众运动，依靠这个运动，发展这个运动，加强晚稻后期管理，力争特大丰收，力争整个农业战线和工业战线的全面跃进。广东省今年粮食生产要比去年提高10％。去年经最后核实为三百二十亿斤，今年应为三百五十亿斤。今年早造因受毁灭性水灾，只收了九十多亿斤，这就是说晚造要完成二百六十亿斤。能否完成三百五十亿斤的任务，决定于晚造。省委认为，每亩晚稻只要能平均收到五百五十斤，全省三百五十亿斤粮食增产的计划就能完成。而今年晚稻由于播种面积扩大，长得好，广东晚稻生产一向又比较稳定，因此只要千千万万的群众再加一把劲，一鼓作气把中后期管理抓到底，搞好秋收，晚稻争个大丰收就极有希望。10月份，要突出地抓好一千万亩秋番薯的田间管理，抓好经济作物，尤其是甘蔗的田间管理。广东省的工业生产今后几个月的任务也特别重，但最近群众运动搞起来以后，发展很快，主要工业生产指标将能够完成。在力争晚造大丰收中，还可能碰到台风、倒伏等等困难；在工业生产中，还会碰到原材料供应不足和技术问题等等困难。但是有了高涨的群众革命运动，这些困难都将肯定地被一个个克服。
