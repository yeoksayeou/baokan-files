    Lost
    [Mongolian] Ma Qin-fu

    I

    When Jiang Yan was preparing to leave her hometown of Sichuan for Baotou, she was already four months pregnant. Initially, her mother tried to dissuade her, saying, "Wait a few more days, Baogang will be built eventually. Go after you give birth!" But Jiang Yan had made up her mind and packed her bags anyway. Her girlfriends teased her, saying, "Auntie, let her go. She's missing Little Zhu so much she's going crazy!" Frankly, the grand construction of Baogang attracted her far more than her longing for her lover. But she answered her girlfriends with an air of seriousness, "Yes, who doesn't miss her husband who is far away!"

    She arrived in Baotou. She was a doctor, and her husband worked in a surveying team. They couldn't see each other even once a month. Several months later, as her due date approached, she came to her husband's workplace to spend her maternity leave. At that time, the two banks of the Kun’dulun River were a wilderness, without a single earthen house, let alone residents. The surveying team lived in canvas tents. Comrades temporarily set up a tent for Jiang Yan and her husband. During the day, her husband went out surveying, and she stayed alone in their "home."

    She heard that walking was a good exercise for women before giving birth. One day, after dinner, while her husband was at a meeting, Xiao Jiang went out for a walk alone. The setting sun draped the boundless grassland in gold. The wilderness was silent. Red and white flags were planted along the way, with thin ropes stretched horizontally and vertically. "We will build a world-class steel base on this wasteland," she recalled her husband often excitedly telling her. She couldn't help but smile. "A world-class steel base, but now there are only sand dunes, thin ropes, and small flags..." It wasn't that she didn't believe her husband, no, she came here precisely for this great ideal; but the ideal was too distant! To build a world-class steel base on such a desolate land was no easy task!

    She walked arbitrarily forward on the pathless wilderness. The colorful clouds in the west gradually faded. An eagle soared proudly in the sky above the grassland; a herd of gazelles wandered leisurely on the distant hills; until now, they still regarded themselves as the "masters" of this place.

    She walked aimlessly along the banks of the Kun’dulun River, where the sandy bottom was exposed. Not far away, several wild rats scurried around. She really wanted to pick up a stone and throw it at them; but she couldn't bend down, so she just made "shush" sounds and scared them away.

    Dusk was fleeting. The first dark curtain of night gradually descended. She couldn't go any further. When she turned around, she realized she had walked too far. The surveying team's tents were blocked by the sand dunes in the distance and were nowhere to be seen; if she hadn't seen the straight line of footprints she had just made, she would hardly have known which direction to go home.

    As long as she found the small flags planted by the surveying team, she wouldn't get lost. She walked and looked around; however, the wilderness was hazy, and she seemed to have suddenly developed night blindness, unable to see anything around her. The sky was overcast again, and she couldn't even see the Big Dipper. After walking for a while, her back and legs began to ache, and she had to stop and rest for a while. This was a depression; she remembered not having walked through this depression just now!

    At this moment, the terrible words "lost" appeared in her mind for the first time!

    She wanted to call out a few times; but there wasn't a single light to be seen around her. Who would hear her voice? She couldn't shout! She heard that there were wolves nearby. Shouting would only attract them, wouldn't that be worse! Thinking of wolves, she suddenly felt very gloomy. A few days ago, the surveying team had lost a sheep to wolves. Thinking of this, she said to herself, "I can't stay here long; go, keep going!"

    After walking for a while, she came out of the depression. But she still couldn't see any lights. She was so anxious that she really wanted to cry!

    Fatigue began to attack her. Her steps became slower and slower, but she didn't want to stop, still insisting on walking step by step. ... Suddenly, she felt a burst of abdominal pain. This time she really became panicked. She clutched her stomach and sat down on the wasteland. Was she going into premature labor due to overwork? Here, in this wilderness! ...

    Where was the surveying team! Where was her husband! Hadn't they finished their meeting yet!

    Suddenly, there was a rhythmic "da-da" sound, which grew closer and closer, and she recognized it as the sound of horse hooves. She held her breath and stared at the approaching black shadow. The black shadow came towards her. She wanted to call out, but she was a little afraid. With a moment of hesitation, a horseman with a gun on his shoulder came to her.

    The horse saw a black thing on the ground, startled and darted to the side. The man on the horse quickly pulled the reins and shouted:

    "He ne? Ya mu ri hong?" (Mongolian: Who! What are you doing?)

    Jiang Yan didn't understand his words, but she roughly understood the meaning of the question.

    "I am from the surveying team."

    "Are you a worker?" The man asked in Chinese with a Mongolian accent, "What are you doing sitting here alone?"

    "I'm lost."

    "Ai, young people!"

    Jiang Yan could tell that he was a Mongolian old man in his fifties. A kind face of a herdsman was covered with wrinkles. She suddenly felt like she had seen her relatives, and her heart lit up: I'm saved!

    This old herdsman was called Huhe. He had roamed this grassland twenty years ago, and later moved to live behind the mountains. Today, several of his cattle had left the herd and were missing. He carried a hunting gun to this area to look for his cattle.

    After listening to Jiang Yan's words, the old herdsman scolded her for not going so far, and urged her to get on the horse quickly, to send her back. She said she had never ridden a horse before, and was afraid of falling and having an accident. Old man Huhe said, I will lead the way holding the reins, you will definitely not fall. But she still declined as if she felt embarrassed. Old man Huhe became anxious, walked over and pulled her onto the horse, and only then did she straddle the horse.

    Old man Huhe led the horse as if walking on a road, and went straight ahead. After walking for a long time, he vaguely saw lights ahead.

    "Ha. This time we've found home. Grandpa, how should I thank you..." Jiang Yan excitedly said half a sentence, when suddenly her stomach started to hurt again. But she endured the pain and didn't tell old man Huhe.

    When they arrived at the surveying team, it was in a chaotic state. Obviously, they had finished the meeting, couldn't find Jiang Yan, and everyone was surprised and uneasy.

    When they came near the tent, the old herdsman helped Jiang Yan dismount, just as Jiang Yan's lover and several young men were holding flashlights and preparing to go out to look for her. Jiang Yan dismounted and said that her stomach hurt very badly. Before everyone could figure out what was going on, they helped her into the tent. Everyone asked the old herdsman to stay, but he said he had to go find his cattle tonight, otherwise the cattle would go far and be lost. So, he said goodbye to everyone and left.

    II

    After that cattle-finding trip, old man Huhe hadn't come to the mountains for many years. He only heard from his son that Baogang was about to be completed, and the wasteland in front of the mountains was covered with high-rise buildings. His son had signed up when Baogang Company recruited the first batch of Mongolian steelworkers, studied in Anshan for a long time, and only returned to Baogang a month ago.

    A few days ago, his son had repeatedly written letters urging his father to go to Baogang to see him.

    He arrived in Baogang. Wow, the front of the mountain had completely changed. He felt like he had come to another world. He looked at the two banks of the Kun'dulun River and rubbed his eyes, saying, "Is this our Mongolian place!"...

    Old man Huhe lived with his son in a room on the third floor of the staff dormitory. During the day, his son went to work, leaving him alone at home, feeling very lonely. The old man decided to go downstairs to take a walk and relax. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to find his way back, so he stuck his horsewhip in front of the building as a marker before he felt comfortable walking away.

    He struggled to get out of the building complex and onto the street. It was probably the time when workers were getting off work, and the streets were crowded with people, really lively. He looked here and there, leisurely strolling, thinking to himself, "That year, it was mostly in this area that I met a lost female doctor." Walking, walking, he didn't know how many building complexes he had passed, how many streets he had walked, and before he knew it, the sun had set in the west, and it was getting late. He thought that his son had already gotten off work, so he hurried back.

    Heavens, he didn't know how many buildings had been built here, walking past one after another; this building and that building were the same color and height, like lambs born on the same day, unable to tell which was which. He was anxious to get home, and from a distance, the row of buildings in front seemed like his home, but when he got to the door, it wasn't! Then he remembered the horsewhip he had stuck at the door. Having no other choice, he would have to search door to door, building by building! He walked past one building after another, one row after another... No! Searching like this, he would break his legs and still not be able to get home. Moreover, who knew if he was getting further and further away from home! Until every house turned on its lights, and night enveloped the city, he still hadn't found his way home. He wanted to ask others, but he hadn't even remembered the building number. How could he ask!

    At this time, a word appeared in his mind: "Lost!"

    Fatigue began to attack him. He felt as if the Mongolian boots on his feet were made of iron, so heavy! He had to find a place to rest his legs.

    He sat down at the corner of a building. He was planning which direction to go to find his way home in a while, when suddenly someone walked by in a hurry, and without noticing that someone was sitting here, stepped on old man Huhe's foot. That person was a female comrade, who quickly apologized to him, saying, "I'm so sorry, I'm picking up my child from the nursery and rushing home."

    In the darkness, he couldn't see the female comrade's face clearly. Saying "It's okay, it's okay," he stood up and said, "Comrade, I'm lost. Do you know where a Mongolian worker named Guan Qika lives?"

    "Guan Qika? Is he a steelworker?"

    He hurriedly replied, "Yes, yes!"

    "We work in the same factory, and his dormitory is very close to my home. Come with me!"

    Huhe happily followed her. After a while, they stopped in front of a building. A horsewhip was still stuck at the door.

    "Here we are. He lives on the third floor. Goodbye!"

    She said and left. How could Huhe let her go? He chased after her and said:

    "Thank you so much! Since you know Guan Qika and helped me, how can you not come in and sit down? I am Guan Qika's father."

    "Old man, I'll come again tomorrow; the child's father is still waiting for us at home!"

    "No, you can't leave. I brought a lot of butter, milk tofu, milk skin, and milk wine from the grassland... According to our Mongolian customs, you must come in and taste our dairy food, and drink a bowl of milk tea before you can leave."

    Just as they were arguing, someone came from the east. He was walking very fast, as if something urgent had happened. When he walked closer, it turned out to be Guan Qika.

    "Dad, where did you go? I couldn't find you, and I was just about to go out and look for you."

    "I got lost, and this female comrade led me back."

    Guan Qika said to the female comrade: "Thank you!"

    The guest entered the house and first asked the old man to sit down. The old man declined, saying:

    "The guest sits first. You are my benefactor!"

    The female comrade put the child on the bed, turned around and smiled at the old man and said:

    "Old man, don't be so polite..." Just as she said half a sentence, she suddenly became dumbfounded for some reason, and then shouted: "Ah! It's you, Uncle Huhe! ... What a coincidence!"

    Guan Qika was stunned, not knowing what was going on. Old man Huhe didn't know what was going on either.

    "Uncle Huhe, my name is Jiang Yan. Don't you remember that I got lost one night, and you led me to the surveying team? That night, I gave birth to this child!"

    At this time, old man Huhe remembered. He saw the cute child on the bed and asked:

    "How old is the child!"

    "Three years old."

    "Ah, it's only been a short three years!" The old man said with emotion, and walked to the window. Looking out from the window, the outside was a world of light and smoke.

    The young people walked to the window together. At this time, the old man said with tears of happiness in the corner of his eyes:

    "Children, I never thought that one day I would get lost in the place where I used to graze in my youth! Lost, what a lucky loss!"

    迷路
    〔蒙族〕玛拉沁夫
    一
    江燕准备离别四川故乡到包头来时，已经怀孕四个月了。当初妈妈劝阻说：“你晚去几天，包钢也能建得成，生完再走吧！”江燕却拿定主意，照样整理自己的行装。女朋友们逗着说：“大娘，放她走吧，人家想小朱想得快疯了！”说实在的，宏伟的包钢建设对她的吸引，远远超过了她思念爱人的心情。但是她对女朋友们却一派正经的答说：“是呵，谁不想自己远别的丈夫呵！”
    她来到了包头。她是医生，而丈夫在测量队工作，两个人一个月，见不上一次面，几个月以后，直到她接近产期时，才来丈夫工作的地方度产假。当时昆都仑河两岸，一片荒漠，别说是住户，就连一间土房都没有。测量队住在帆布帐篷里。同志们替江燕夫妇临时搭起一顶帐篷。白天丈夫出外测量，她一个人留在“家”里。
    听人说，女同志生产前，散步是很好的运动。有一天晚饭后，在丈夫开会的时候，小江一个人出外散步。夕阳替一望无边的草原披上了金装。原野上一片寂静。一路上，插有红白小旗，横横竖竖拉着细绳。“我们就在这片荒原上，建设成世界上第一流的钢铁基地。”她想起丈夫常常兴奋的对她说的这句话，不由的笑了。“世界上第一流的钢铁基地，可现在只有沙丘、细绳、小旗……”她不是不相信丈夫的话，不，她正是为了这个伟大的理想，才来到这里的；但是，这理想却太遥远了！在这样荒漠的大地上，建设起一座世界上第一流的钢铁基地，那不是一件轻而易举的事呵！
    她在没有道路的荒原上，向前任意的走去。西天的彩霞渐渐暗淡下去。一只雄鹰在草原上空傲然飞翔；远处丘陵上有一群羚羊闲散的游荡着；直到现在它们还把自己当作是这里的“主人”。
    她沿着露出沙底的昆都仑河岸，无目的地向前走着。不远的地方，有几只野鼠窜来窜去，她真想拾起一块石头向它们抛去；但是她弯不下腰去，只得“嘘嘘”的叫几声，把它们吓跑了。
    黄昏是暂短的。夜的第一道暗幕渐渐漫了下来。她不能再往前走了。当她转回身来时，才发觉自己走的太远了。测量队的帐篷，被远处的沙丘遮挡得无影无踪；如果不是她看见自己刚刚走过来的笔直一条脚印，几乎不知道该往哪个方向去找家了。
    只要是找到测量队插下的小旗，就不会迷路了。她边走边向四处寻视；然而原野上一片朦胧，她像是突然患了夜盲症，周围的一切都看不清楚。又阴了天，连个北斗星也看不见。又走了一阵，腰腿开始酸痛了，她不得不停住歇息一会儿。这里一片洼地，她记得方才没有走过这块洼地呀！
    这时，她的脑海里，第一次出现了可怕的字眼“迷路了！”
    她想呼唤几声；但是四周连个灯火都看不见，哪里会有人听到你的声音？不能喊！听人说，附近有狼。一喊，再把它招来，不是更糟！想到狼，忽然感到很阴森。前些天，测量队的一只羊就叫狼给叼走了。想到这里，她对自己说：“这地方不能久停；走，往前走！”
    走了一会，出了洼地。然而仍然看不见灯光。她急得真想哭一场！
    疲累开始向她进攻了。她的脚步越来越慢下来，但，她不愿停住，仍然坚持一步一步的走着。……突然，她感到一阵腹痛。这一下她确实变得惊慌失措了。她捂着肚子往荒地上坐了下去。是不是因劳累过度，要提前生产哪？在这荒原上！……
    测量队在哪里！丈夫在哪里！他们还没有开完会吗！
    忽然传来一阵有节奏的“哒哒”声响，这声音越来越近，听出是马蹄声。她屏住气目不转睛的注视那越来越近的黑影。黑影向她走来了，她想叫，但又有点怕，一迟疑，一个挎枪的骑马人到了她面前。
    马看见地上有块黑东西，一惊向旁闪身便跑，马上的人急忙勒住缰绳，大声问道：
    “合呢？牙木日红？”（蒙语：谁！干什么的？）
    江燕听不懂他的话，但约摸出问话的意思。
    “我是测量队的。”
    “你是工人？”那个人用蒙古调的汉话问道：“一个人坐在这儿，干什么？”
    “我迷路了。”
    “唉，年青人！”
    江燕看出他是一个五十开外的蒙族老人。一张牧民慈善的脸上布满了皱纹。她突然像是看见了自己的亲人，心里一亮：我得救了！
    这老牧民叫呼和，二十年前就在这一带草地上游牧，后来搬到山后去住了。今天他的几头牛离了群，找不到了，他扛上猎枪到这一带来寻牛。
    听了江燕的话，老牧人一面责备她不该走出这么远，一面催她快上马，要送她回去。她说从来没骑过马，怕摔下来出意外的事。呼和老人说，我牵着马笼头领路，你绝对不会摔下来。但她仍过意不去似的推辞，老牧人急了，走过去就拉她上马，这样她才跨上了马背。
    呼和老人牵着马如走在马路上，向前直奔而去。走了好久，隐约看见前面有了灯光。
    “呵。这回算是找到家了。老大爷，我该怎样感谢……”江燕兴奋的刚把话说了半截，突然肚子又痛了起来。但她忍着痛，没有告诉呼和老人。
    当他们来到测量队时，这里乱哄哄一团。显然是开完会，找不到江燕，大家都在惊奇、不安。
    来到帐篷附近，老牧人扶着江燕下马的时候，正好江燕的爱人和几个小伙子拿着手电筒准备出去找她。江燕下马就说，肚子痛得很厉害，大家还摸不清怎么回事，先把她扶进了帐篷。众人留老牧人住下，他说今晚非去找牛不可，要不然牛就走远，找不回来了。这样，他告别大家便走了。
    二
    从那次寻牛回去以后，呼和老人好几年没有到山前来了。只听儿子来信说，包钢快建成了，山前那片荒原上盖满了高楼大厦。他儿子在包钢公司招收第一批蒙古族钢铁工人时，报了名，到鞍钢学习了很久，一个月以前才回包钢来的。
    前些天，儿子接二连三的来信，叫父亲到包钢去看他。
    他来到了包钢。吓，山前完全变了样，他像是来到了另一个世界。他望着昆都仑河两岸，揉了揉眼睛说：“这是咱们蒙古地方吗！”……
    呼和老人跟儿子住在职工宿舍三楼的一间房里，白天儿子上班去，家里只剩他一个人，十分寂寞。老汉决定下楼出外走走，散散心，他唯恐出去回来时找不到家，把马鞭插在这幢楼门口，作好标记才放心走去。
    他费了好大力气，才转出楼群，来到大街上。大概正是工人下班的时候，街上人山人海，真热闹。他一个人这儿看看，那儿瞧瞧，不慌不忙地蹓跶，心里约摸着想：“那年，大半是就在这块地方，我遇见过一个迷路的女医生。”走呵，走呵，不知绕过了多少楼群，走过了多少街道，不觉之间，日落西山，天色已晚，他想到儿子已经下了班，于是急忙往回走。
    天哪，也不知道这里盖起了多少幢大楼，走过一幢又一幢；这幢与那幢一样颜色一般高，就像同一天生的羊羔，分不清哪个是哪个。他急着赶回家去，从远看去，前面那排楼房，就像是他的家，但走到门口一看，不是！这时他想起在家门口插的马鞭，没有旁的办法，按门按户一幢一幢的找吧！走了一幢又一幢，走了一排又一排……不成！这样找，走断了腿也回不到家去。而况，谁知道他越走离家越远了！直到家家点起电灯，夜笼罩了城市时，他还没有找到家。他想问别人，可是连楼号都没记住，可咋个问哪！
    这时他脑海里出现了一个字眼：“迷路了！”
    疲劳开始向他进攻了。他觉得脚上的蒙古靴子仿佛是用铁做的，是那样沉重！他不得不找个地方歇一歇腿了。
    他在一幢房的拐角处坐了下来。他正在盘算着过一会往哪个方向去找家的当儿，忽然有一个人匆忙的走着，一拐角没有注意到这里坐着人，一下踩在呼和老人的脚上。那个人是个女同志，赶紧向他道歉说：“实在对不起，我是从托儿所接孩子回来，赶着回家去。”
    在黑暗中他看不清楚那个女同志的脸。边说着“没关系，没关系”，边站起来说：“同志，我迷了路，你知不知道一个蒙族工人关其卡住在哪里？”
    “关其卡？是炼钢工人？”
    他忙答说：“对，对！”
    “我们在一个厂子工作，他的宿舍离我家很近，你跟我走吧！”
    呼和满心欢喜的跟着她走。一会儿，他们便在一幢楼房门口停住了。一根马鞭还插在门口。
    “到了。他住在三楼。再见！”
    她说罢就走。呼和怎肯叫她走呢？追过去说道：
    “太谢谢你了！你既然跟关其卡认识，又帮助了我，怎能不进屋坐一坐呢？我是关其卡的父亲。”
    “老大爷，我明天再来；孩子他爸爸还在家里等着我们呢！”
    “不，不能走，我从草地带来不少黄油、奶豆腐、奶皮子、奶酒……按照我们蒙古人的规矩，你非要进屋尝尝我们的奶食，喝一碗奶茶才能走。”
    正在他们争让不休的时候，从东边走来了个人。脚步很快，像有急事。等他走近来一看，原来正是关其卡。
    “爸爸，你到哪儿去啦？我怎么也找不着，刚要出去找你。”
    “我走迷了路，是这位女同志把我领回来的。”
    关其卡向那位女同志说：“谢谢你了！”
    客人进了屋，先请老人坐下。老人推让说：
    “客人先坐。你是我的恩人！”
    那位女同志把孩子放在床上，转过脸来笑着对老人说：
    “老大爷，别客……”话刚说了半句，不知为什么，她突然变得目瞪口呆，紧接喊了一声：“呵！是您，呼和大叔！……多凑巧呵！”
    关其卡摸不着头脑都楞住了。呼和老人一时也闹不清是咋回事。
    “呼和大叔，我叫江燕，您不记得有一次我在夜里迷了路，是您把我领到测量队的吗？那天晚上，我就生了这个孩子！”
    这时呼和老人回想起来了。他看见床上那可爱的小孩，问道：
    “孩子几岁了！”
    “三周岁了。”
    “呵，只不过是短短的三年哪！”老人感叹的说着，走到窗前。从楼窗往外望去，外面是一片光和烟的世界。
    年青人不约而同的向窗前走了过去。这时老人眼角上挂着幸福的泪水说道：
    “孩子们，我真没想到有一天会在自己青年时代放牧的地方迷路！迷路，多么幸运的迷路呵！”
