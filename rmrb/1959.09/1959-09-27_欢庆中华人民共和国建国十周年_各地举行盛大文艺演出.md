Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: The grand performances held by literary and art circles across the country to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China have begun successively.

    The Shanghai opera community has launched an exhibition performance month celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, starting from the 23rd. The opera genres participating in the performance include Peking Opera, Yue Opera, Shanghai Opera, Huai Opera, Yang Opera, Yong Opera, comedy, Xiju Opera, Pingtan storytelling, acrobatics, and puppetry. The repertoire includes traditional old plays infused with new blood, modern plays that fully reflect the spirit of the times, and a certain proportion of plays with the themes of reflecting the Great Leap Forward, singing the General Line, and portraying the People's Communes. A major feature of this exhibition performance is that each opera genre displays its unique style, and various artistic schools and performance styles are inclusively absorbed. Famous Peking Opera performing artist Zhou Xinfang will shape the image of Hai Rui, who insists on justice and is upright and selfless, in the new play "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial" with his unique "Kirin School" style. Famous Yue Opera actress Yuan Xuefen will star in "Qiu Jin." The Shanghai music and dance circles also launched a joint performance celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, starting from the 20th. The joint performance will hold a total of fifteen concerts. Nine professional groups, including the Shanghai Experimental Opera House, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Chorus, and the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, have prepared excellent programs to participate in this performance. Famous Shanghai singers Zhou Xiaoyan, Cai Shaoxu, Dong Ailin, Wen Kezheng, performers Wu Leyi, Wei Zhongle, conductors Huang Yijun, Yang Jiaren, Ge Chaozhi, and dancers Shu Qiao and Chen Jianmin will all participate in the performance.

    The Tianjin opera troupes' opera exhibition performance month celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China will begin on October 1st. Participating in this exhibition performance are 2,600 actors from 75 professional art troupes including Hebei Bangzi Opera, Ping Opera, Peking Opera, Quyi folk art, Yue Opera, drama, song and dance, and acrobatics. More than 700 programs will be presented to the audience in turn. In order to allow workers who do not rest during the holidays to see the shows, many troupes are also preparing to tour factories.

    Shaanxi Province launched a gift performance exhibition month on the 22nd in Xi'an by all provincial art performance troupes to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. More than 30 units, including provincial, municipal, and county drama troupes, song and dance troupes, music groups, opera troupes, puppet troupes, Quyi troupes, and acrobatic troupes, are participating in the exhibition performance, with 25 opera genres and more than 200 programs. Among them are traditional plays such as "Chopping the Son," "Disturbing the Nunnery," and "Night Dream of the Crown," which were excavated from the ancient Tongzhou Bangzi and Han Opera Erhuang, as well as programs that reflect the struggle life of our country in various revolutionary periods and socialist construction, especially since the Great Leap Forward, in different art forms such as drama, opera, Qin Opera, and Yu Opera. Such as "The Long March," "Beside the Jinsha River," and "Red Waves of Bashan"; the budding artistic seedlings of the opera school will show their talents in the performance. Shang Xiaoyun and Xu Biyun, experienced Peking Opera veterans in their sixties, will also enthusiastically participate in the gift performance.

    The repertoires of Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City's drama and art circles celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, starting from the 25th, will be presented to the broad masses of working people in squares, parks, and streets such as Zhongju Bridge, Zhaojing Temple on the shore of West Lake, and Yegong Garden in Hangzhou City. The presented Peking Opera "Battle of Gaixia," Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber," Wu Opera "Golden Seal," Kunqu Opera "Zhang San Borrows Boots," Shao Opera "Centenarian Takes Command," and drama "Unnamed Island" and more than 30 other repertoires have all been carefully selected and repeatedly processed and refined through performances at all levels.

    Jilin Province has twelve gift repertoires that are being staged successively. They are the large-scale opera "Full Mountain Red"; the drama "Yang Jingyu"; the Peking Opera "Wisely Capturing the Bandit Chief Zuoshan Diao" and "Automobile City"; the Ping Opera "The New Generation" and "Red Sisters," etc. These gift repertoires with modern themes all reflect major themes, and historical themes all have strong popular appeal. The drama "Yang Jingyu" is the first time to vividly and profoundly bring the heroic deeds of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army to the stage. It describes the fighting life of General Yang Jingyu, the leader of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. The Peking Opera "Automobile City" reflects the struggle between old and new ideas in the industrial technological innovation movement. The gift repertoires are also rich in local flavor and local color.

    Many provinces and regions, such as Shanxi, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Guizhou, have beautiful operas, music, and dance programs with strong local characteristics and a wide range of life reflected, which are being staged during the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Guiyang City Sichuan Opera Troupe created and rehearsed the large-scale historical drama "Zhang Xiumei" as a gift to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This script is based on the historical facts of the feudal ruling class "bloodbath of the Miao case" and the uprisings of the Miao, Dong, and other ethnic groups in Guizhou during the Xianfeng-Tongzhi years of the Qing Dynasty. It portrays the heroic image of Zhang Xiumei, the outstanding leader of the Miao people, and reflects the Miao people's "killing officials to rise up" and "smartly seizing Taigong" and other vigorous "Xian-Tong eighteen years of anti-rebellion" struggle in coordination with the Taiping Army.
