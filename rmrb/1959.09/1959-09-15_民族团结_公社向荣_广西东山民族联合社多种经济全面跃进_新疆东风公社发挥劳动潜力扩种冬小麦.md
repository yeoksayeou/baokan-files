Ethnic Unity, Commune Thriving
Guangxi's Dongshan Ethnic United Commune Achieves All-Round Leap in Diverse Economy
Xinjiang's Dongfeng Commune Explores Labor Potential to Expand Winter Wheat Planting

(Our report) The Dongshan Ethnic United Commune in Quanxian County, Guangxi, known as "seven parts stone, three parts soil," has witnessed prosperity in all sectors over the past year, with 95% of its members increasing their income.

The Dongshan Commune was originally formed by the merger of fifty-five advanced agricultural cooperatives. The commune has more than 6,300 households and over 27,000 people, with Yao and Han members each accounting for half. This year, building on the great leap forward of last year, agricultural production has achieved tremendous results. In terms of grain, the already harvested 15,000-plus mu of rice has achieved a per-mu yield of 534 jin of dry grain, and it is estimated that the total grain output for the year will increase by 11% compared to last year. The summer grain procurement task has been overfulfilled by 270,000 jin ahead of schedule. Comprehensive leaps forward have also been achieved in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. To date, forestry income is 110,000 yuan, an increase of 144% over the entire last year. Pig farming has reached more than 32,000 heads, averaging 5.1 heads per household; the number of draught cattle has increased to more than 10,600, averaging 1.68 heads per household, an increase of 12% over last year; and the average number of chickens and ducks is 16.5 per household. The cash income from sideline production averages 117 yuan per household, an increase of 12% compared to the same period last year. Fish farming has reached 3.2 million.

Due to the commune's unified use of labor, resources, financial resources, and technology, six new factories and mines have been established, changing the historical lack of industry. These industries not only increased the commune's income but also played a significant role in supporting the development of agricultural production and national construction. Last winter, 45 tons of high-quality iron were smelted, supporting the steel production of Shanghai and meeting the needs of the commune's agricultural tool manufacturing; subsequently, factories and mines producing sulfur, lead-zinc, cement, coal, winemaking, and agricultural tools were established.

Strengthening ethnic unity and organizing large-scale collaboration are the main reasons why the Dongshan Commune was able to overcome this year's severe flood and drought disasters and achieve a bumper harvest. Of the commune's more than 28,000 mu of fields, 19,000 mu used to "rely on the heavens for grain." In the year since the commune's establishment, the entire commune has jointly built three reservoirs, 422 ponds, ditches, and wells, which can irrigate 13,600 mu of land. Therefore, even though severe floods and droughts were encountered this year, it was still possible to preserve planting and ensure a harvest.

The comprehensive development of various productions in the Dongshan Commune is inseparable from the large amount of labor force liberated after communization. Transportation here is very inconvenient. In the past, 100,000 labor days were spent each year transporting grain and various daily necessities from other places, so agricultural production labor was even more lacking. Last winter, according to the needs of production development, the commune uniformly organized more than 5,200 people and worked hard for 34 days, splitting 18 large mountains and building a 43-kilometer-long highway. With convenient transportation, a lot of labor for transportation was saved. The commune vigorously established public canteens and nurseries, liberating a large number of women who were entangled in household chores to invest in production. The commune also uniformly adjusted more than 800 mu of "interspersed fields," turning distant fields into nearby fields, which also saved a lot of labor. This freed up enough labor for the comprehensive development of production, intensive cultivation, and disaster resistance. This year, rice transplanting was advanced by one season compared to previous years, and five ploughings and five harrows were changed to seven ploughings and seven harrows, with 185 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu.

With the great leap forward in various productions, people's material and cultural lives have also been greatly improved. In the past year, the sales of various fabrics were four times that of 1953, an increase of 75% compared to the same period last year; the sales of rubber shoes also increased by 50% compared to the same period last year. There are currently more than 5,300 adults enrolled in school in the commune, accounting for 92% of the number of people who should be eliminated from illiteracy; there are a total of 89 primary schools in the commune, and the number of enrolled children accounts for 92% of the number of children who should be enrolled, an increase of 11.2% compared to 1958.

(Our report) Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Dongfeng People's Commune, Miquan County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, are fighting hard in the fields, determined to sow 100,000 mu of winter wheat by the end of September. After the establishment of this commune, which consists of more than 3,000 households of Hui, Han, Uygur, and Kazakh farmers and herdsmen, the planting area has been expanded by 71,000 mu (the total area has reached 164,000 mu), and the total wheat output has increased by 7.5 million jin compared to last year. In addition to autumn crops, it is estimated that the total grain output for the year will increase by 10 million jin compared to last year. At present, members of all ethnic groups are in high spirits and are fighting hard in the fields to sow winter wheat and prepare for the autumn harvest. They are determined to work hard for 40 days to sow 100,000 mu of winter wheat by the end of the month. Currently, more than 2,000 laborers and more than 600 yokes of draught animals are dispatched every day, plowing and sowing simultaneously. The fields are bustling with activity, and dust is swirling.

The Dongfeng People's Commune is composed of sixteen agricultural cooperatives and four pastoral cooperatives, close to the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, with abundant land and a small labor force. This spring, according to the production plan formulated by the commune to expand the cultivated area, each laborer was burdened with an average of 44 mu of cultivated land, and draught animals were also insufficient. Under this circumstance, the Party committee of the Dongfeng People's Commune fully mobilized the masses, overcame the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power, and gave full play to the superiority of the People's Commune. On the basis of running canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and sewing factories well, the commune liberated a large number of female laborers. More than 1,600 women in the entire commune worked about 25 days a month, which is about ten days more than before communization. In the past, women only participated in labor such as weeding, seed selection, and bundling wheat. Now, most female members work with male members in carting, plowing, sowing, and harvesting, and labor efficiency has been greatly improved.

The commune uniformly plans production and rationally arranges labor. During busy farming seasons, 80% of the labor force is concentrated on agricultural production, and various specialized teams are organized according to labor expertise and strength. Tasks that semi-laborers can do are not assigned to full laborers, truly achieving the best use of talents.

The commune uniformly allocates water sources to ensure timely irrigation of crops. This year, the commune planted a total of 164,000 mu of crops, including more than 110,000 mu of paddy fields, and timely watering was a major problem. In the case of a shortage of labor in the spring, in addition to mobilizing a small part of the labor force to dig springs and repair canals, the management of water use was also strengthened. The spring water, canal water, and mountain water that were managed separately by the sixteen accounting units of the entire commune in the past were uniformly allocated. Crops in the entire commune were ranked, and the past rotational irrigation system was changed to watering according to actual needs, which greatly saved water and expanded the irrigated area.

Communist large-scale collaboration has been launched between production teams, and between industry, agriculture and animal husbandry, promoting common development. The commune's agricultural tool repair factory promptly manufactured a large number of earth plows, sickles and other agricultural tools for each production team, and manufactured 50 horse-drawn gear threshing machines equipped with ball bearings, saving 50 draught horses and improving efficiency by one time. The Guodiken production team had only more than 100 laborers, and the seven surrounding production teams used the method of extracting one person out of ten and one horse out of ten to squeeze out labor and draught animals to help complete the task of sowing more than 1,000 mu of rice. Under the principle of equivalent exchange, two pastoral production teams dominated by Kazakhs extracted more than 40 pairs of cattle and 70 horses to support agricultural production teams in plowing and threshing; agricultural production teams also collected more than 14,000 jin of spring wheat seeds, 3,800 jin of rice seeds and two large carts to support the Kazakh brothers, who had rarely grown crops in the past, to plant 2,400 mu of spring wheat and more than 160 mu of rice, promoting the double leap forward of agriculture and animal husbandry.

At present, the members of the Dongfeng Commune are carrying out intensive labor to expand the planting of winter wheat. The commune Party committee, through labor force ranking and careful accounting, fully exploited the labor potential, and extracted manpower from the organs to support land reclamation; the commune Party committee secretary took the lead in contracting plots by areas, and whenever it rained, the commune organized one or two hundred laborers and more than one hundred pairs of livestock to brave the rain to go up the mountain to seize the moisture and launch a surprise attack to cultivate the land. From the beginning of July to the end of August, the entire commune came and went on surprise attacks, having plowed more than 57,000 mu of dry and paddy fields, and sowed winter wheat on more than 22,000 mu of land. The entire commune plans to sow 38,000 mu of winter wheat in the dry land on the mountains. This kind of dry land is fertile, and after sowing, it can be harvested without management.

The Dongfeng Commune has put forward a competition initiative to the farmers of all ethnic groups in the people's communes of Miquan County and Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, determined to over fulfill the winter sowing plan and do a good job in summer harvest and autumn harvest.

    民族团结　公社向荣
    广西东山民族联合社多种经济全面跃进
    新疆东风公社发挥劳动潜力扩种冬小麦
    本报讯　“七分石头三分土”的广西全县东山民族联合公社，一年来百业兴旺，95％的社员增加了收入。
    东山公社原由五十五个高级农业社合并建成。全社共有六千三百多户，二万七千多人，瑶、汉族社员各占一半。今年在去年大跃进的基础上，农业生产取得了巨大的成绩。粮食方面，已收的一万五千多亩水稻，亩产干谷达到五百三十四斤，预计全年粮食比去年增产11％。夏粮征购任务已超额二十七万斤提前完成。林、牧、副、渔各业也获得了全面跃进。到目前止，林业收入十一万元，比去年全年增长144％。养猪三万二千多头，平均每户五点一头；耕牛发展到一万零六百多头，每户平均一点六八头，比去年增加12％；鸡鸭平均每户十六只半。副业生产的现金收入每户平均一百一十七元，比去年同期增加12％。养鱼三百二十万尾。
    由于公社统一使用劳动力、资源、财力和技术力量，新开办了六个厂矿，改变了没有工业的历史面貌。这些工业不但增加了公社收入，对支援农业生产的发展和国家建设也起了很大作用。去年冬天炼出了四十五吨好铁，支援上海市的钢铁生产，并且满足了公社农具制造的需要；接着兴办了硫磺、铅锌、水泥、煤矿、酿酒、农具等厂矿。
    加强民族团结，组织大协作，是东山公社能够战胜今年严重水旱灾害，取得丰收的主要原因。全公社二万八千多亩田，过去有一万九千亩“靠天收粮”。公社成立的一年当中，全社协作共修水库三座，塘、沟、井四百二十二个，可灌田一万三千六百亩。因此，今年虽然遭受了严重的水灾和旱灾，也能保种保收。
    东山公社各项生产能够得到全面发展和公社化后解放了大批劳动力是分不开的。这里交通十分不便，过去每年要花十万个劳动日，从外地挑进粮食和各种日常用品，因此农业生产劳力更感不足。去年冬天，公社根据发展生产的需要，统一组织了五千二百多人，大战三十四天，劈开十八座大山，修好了四十三公里长的公路。交通方便了，大大节省了搞运输的劳动力。公社大办公共食堂和托儿所，解放了大批被家务琐事纠缠的妇女投入了生产。公社又统一调整了八百多亩“插花田”，变远田为近田，也节省了大批劳动力。这样就为全面发展生产、精耕细作和抗灾腾出了足够的劳动力。今年插秧比往年提早一个季节，变五犁五耙为七犁七耙，每亩施底肥一百八十五担。
    随着各项生产大跃进，人们的物质、文化生活也大大提高了。一年来，销售的各种布匹等于1953年的四倍，比上年同期增加了75％；胶鞋比上年同期也增加了50％。全社现有五千三百多个成年人入学，占应扫盲人数的92％；全社共有小学八十九所，入学儿童占应入学儿童92％，比1958年增长11.2％。
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区米泉县东风人民公社的各族农民正奋战田间，决心在9月底播完十万亩冬小麦。这个公社三千多户回、汉、维吾尔、哈萨克族农牧民，在公社成立后，播种面积扩大了七万一千亩（总面积达到十六万四千亩），小麦总产量比去年增产七百五十万斤，加上秋季作物，预计全年粮食总产量可比去年增产一千万斤。目前各族社员斗志昂扬，正奋战田间播种冬麦和准备秋收工作，他们决心苦战四十天，到月底播种冬麦十万亩。现在全社每天出动两千多名劳动力，六百多犋耕畜，边犁地、边播种，田野里人声鼎沸，尘土滚滚。
    东风人民公社是由十六个农业社和四个牧业社组成的，靠近天山脚下，土地多，劳动力少。今年春天，按照公社订出的扩大耕地面积的生产计划，平均每个劳动力负担耕地四十四亩，耕畜也不足。根据这种情况，东风人民公社党委充分发动群众，克服劳力畜力不足的困难，充分发挥了人民公社的优越性。公社在办好食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院和缝纫厂的基础上，解放了大批妇女劳动力。全公社一千六百多名妇女每月都出工二十五天左右，比公社化以前多做了大约十天。过去妇女只参加拔草、选种、捆麦子等劳动，现在大多数女社员都和男社员一起?车、犁地、播种、收割，劳动效率大大提高。
    公社统一筹划生产，合理安排劳动力。农忙时，集中80％的劳动力投入农业生产，并按劳动力专长和强弱，分别组织各种专业队，半劳力能干的活，不让全劳力去作，真正做到了人尽其才。
    公社统一调配水源，保证作物适时灌溉。今年，公社共种了十六万四千亩庄稼，其中有水地十一万多亩，及时浇水是一很大问题。在春季劳动力缺少的情况下，除动员了小部分人力挖泉眼、修水渠外，还加强用水的管理工作，把全公社十六个核算单位过去分散管理的泉水、渠水、山水等实行统一调配，全公社作物进行排队，把过去的轮浇制度改为按实际需要浇水，大大节省了水量，扩大了灌溉面积。
    公社各生产队之间、工农牧业之间展开了共产主义大协作，促进共同发展。公社农具修配厂及时为各生产队制造了大批土犁、镰刀等农具，并且制造了五十部装有滚珠轴承的马拉齿轮打场机，节省了五十匹耕马，提高效率一倍。锅底坑生产队只有一百多名劳动力，周围的七个生产队就用十人抽一人，十马抽一马的办法，挤出人力和耕畜帮助完成播种一千多亩水稻的任务。在等价交换的原则下，两个哈萨克族为主的牧业生产队，抽出四十多对牛、七十匹马，支援农业生产队犁地和打场；农业生产队也凑来了一万四千多斤春麦种子、三千八百斤水稻种子和两辆大车，支援过去很少种庄稼的哈萨克兄弟种上了二千四百亩春麦和一百六十多亩水稻，促进了农牧业双双跃进。
    目前，东风公社的社员正在为扩种冬麦进行紧张的劳动。公社党委通过劳动力排队、算细账，充分发挥劳动潜力，并从机关干部中抽出人力支援开荒；公社党委书记挂帅分片包干，每当下一场雨，公社就组织一二百名劳力和一百多对牲畜冒雨上山抢墒突击翻耕土地。从7月初到8月底，全社往来突击，已犁好水旱田五万七千多亩，在二万二千多亩地里已播上冬麦。全公社计划在山上旱田播种冬麦三万八千亩，这种旱田土地肥沃，播种之后，不用管理就可收获。
    东风公社已向米泉县、昌吉回族自治州各人民公社各族农民提出竞赛倡议，决心超额完成冬播计划和作好夏收、秋收工作。
