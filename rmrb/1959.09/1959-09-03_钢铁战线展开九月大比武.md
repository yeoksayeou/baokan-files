Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 1st: Anshan Iron and Steel Company's vast workforce is continuing their efforts, determined to fight a bigger battle in September's production to greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day, and to lay a good foundation for completing the year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota.
September's production targets for Anshan Iron and Steel's various products have increased significantly compared to August. The Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee already held a meeting on August 31st with factory and mine Party Committee secretaries and factory and mine directors to summarize the work experience of August and deploy September's production tasks.
Before this meeting, many Anshan Iron and Steel factories and mines, while focusing on the last few days of August's production, used the form of great debates, great releases, and big-character posters to mobilize the masses to discuss September's increased production targets. Many factories and mines have taken measures in production technology and management to ensure the completion of September's increased production plan. The First Steelmaking Plant organized specialists to check the condition of the furnace bodies, and the open-hearth furnace section established youth shock brigades to specifically help each furnace solve key problems with the furnace bodies. They decided to further implement measures for more charging and faster refining on the basis of maintaining the furnace bodies well, striving to push production forward in September. The Second Steelmaking Plant recently adjusted its organizational structure, assigning several chief furnace leaders to the furnaces as furnace leaders, making the grassroots production leadership force more substantial. Open-hearth furnace teams have also added furnace protection technicians, who are excellent steelmaking workers, to fully strengthen furnace body maintenance. On this basis, the plant plans to increase the charging capacity of each furnace from the current 290-plus tons to 310 tons starting from September 1st, to ensure a large increase in open-hearth furnace production. The workers of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces, which completed the August plan ahead of schedule, are comprehensively summarizing the experience of the August technical performance and are preparing to promote it systematically in September to further improve production. The Ironmaking Plant recently conducted a general inspection of the various equipment of the blast furnaces, and immediately repaired the equipment defects found, creating favorable conditions for organizing high-quality and high-yield production in September. The workers of the thirteen rolling mills, who achieved a great victory in August production, have also made systematic preparations to ensure that they create greater achievements in production in September.
In the past four days, Anshan Iron and Steel's steel production has exceeded or approached the higher daily plan level for September for three days; steel output has reached the daily plan level for September every day; and pig iron production has also been continuously increasing. These achievements have created a good start for high production in September.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 1st: All workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company held a rally on August 29th, unanimously adopting a guarantee to complete the year's production plans ten to fifteen days ahead of schedule, respectively. All the workers attending the meeting resolutely responded to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and decided to focus on the seven key areas of consolidating the desulfurization battle results, improving furnace life, improving smelting operations, saving raw materials, strengthening equipment maintenance, strengthening operation scheduling, and tapping transportation potential, to carry out a vigorous technical revolution, vigorously promote advanced experience, and launch opponent competitions and collaborative competitions to strive to achieve their promises.
Encouraged by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, in recent days, all workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have been enthusiastically discussing how their units can guarantee the completion of this year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, and have formulated measures and stipulated dates as goals for everyone's efforts. On the other hand, they are seizing the current production and immediately realizing their guarantees. Therefore, reports of production victories are frequently heard. The main force of steelmaking production in the entire company—the large open-hearth furnace workshop—is seizing the good opportunity of the furnace's recent overhaul, insisting on implementing the advanced experiences of "more charging and faster refining" and "standing guard, being responsible for zones, and three-level inspections," and working hard. On August 27th, the workers of Furnace No. 4 used only seven minutes and forty-one seconds to refine a furnace of good steel, setting a new record since the furnace was opened. The workers of the small and medium-sized rolling mills have taken specific measures to quickly roll steel these days, completing the August production plan four days ahead of schedule on the 27th. At the rally, the workers of this factory also proposed to produce 5,000 tons more steel in September than in the previous month, and to increase steel production by another 10,000 tons for the country on the basis of completing the year's plan ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, September 1st: The workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, on the basis of achieving great results in August, are determined to create a significant leap forward to greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day. The goal they have proposed is: to work hard for thirty days in September, increasing the production levels of steel, iron, and steel products by 33%, 40%, and 50% respectively, compared to August.
After the publication of the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the resolution on the increased production and conservation campaign, the workers of this company were enthusiastic and energetic, doubling their efforts. In the last five days of August, the daily output of major products such as pig iron, coke, and electric furnace steel all created the highest records since this year, and many quotas were broken, showing a new atmosphere. The Party Committee of this company recently inspected the vigorous development of the new high tide of the increased production and conservation campaign, and decided to lead the workers and masses to continue to go all out, strive for the top, seize the opportunity, and raise iron and steel production to a higher level in September.
In order to substantially increase the level of production, the company decided to lead the steelmaking and ironmaking workers to vigorously improve technical operations in September and give full play to the production potential of the equipment. Recently, the foremen and workers of blast furnaces and converters have discussed ways to improve operations. The Ironmaking Plant has proposed fifty specific measures to improve operations. After the electric furnace steelmaking workers implemented in-furnace deoxidation and increased current operation measures, the production level can be increased by 30 tons per day in September.
With the growth of production levels, the need for raw materials will increase, the load on equipment will increase, and the amount of transportation and supply will increase, which will bring a series of new imbalances. To this end, the company decided to focus on "before, after, left, and right" around iron and steel production, and organize all employees of the company to carry out a dragon-style large-scale collaborative competition, and also organize collaborative competitions within factories, workshops, and teams. For example, in order to ensure the supply of production, transportation workers have implemented fixed-point transportation methods for blast furnaces, converters, and other units, and have arranged operating charts. The company has also ranked the spare parts necessary for each major piece of equipment and mobilized mechanical repair workers to rush to produce them in September. Under the slogan of preparing sufficient fine grains for the blast furnace, the workers decided to pick out one ton of ore with high iron content and qualified size from the ore per person and supply it to the blast furnace for ironmaking.
At present, the workers of the entire company are discussing and formulating the guarantee plans of the teams, and a great battle to seize steel and iron is about to unfold more vigorously.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 2nd: The ore base of Wuhan Iron and Steel—Daye Iron Mine—overfulfilled the August iron ore mining plan by 4,000 tons, meeting the needs of Wuhan Iron and Steel's blast furnace production. Now, all workers are continuing their efforts, making full use of favorable conditions, and striving to increase the average daily output in September by more than 12% compared to late August.
After Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 2 blast furnace was put into production, the demand for ore surged, and the task of supplying ore became increasingly heavy. From the beginning of August, the Party Committee of Daye Iron Mine decided to use the experience of combining centralized leadership and large-scale mass movement last year to establish a "key problem tackling" headquarters to lead the masses to concentrate their efforts to solve key production problems. In order to increase the source of ore, the opening of the 112-meter working surface of Lion Mountain is one of the major key problems of the entire mine. Party Secretary Chen Mingjiang personally went to the mountain to understand the situation and found that the transportation line was unreasonable and that one kilometer of highway and 400 meters of railway had to be built first. He immediately organized a large-scale collaboration throughout the mine. Laotieshan sent an excavator, the concentrator supported labor, and the supply section supported sleepers. As a result, the task was completed five days ahead of schedule, and the 112-meter working surface began to supply ore on August 15th. Deputy Mine Director Chen Qinglian personally took the lead in overcoming the "screen pass" of the concentrator. He worked with the old workers and technicians of the crushing section to study where the problems with the screen were and how to improve it. After repeated research and experiments, they changed the flat-bottom screen to a trapezoidal and arched-bottom screen, changed the fine screen bars, and increased the screen holes. The screening capacity of each screen reached 210 tons per hour, more than double the design capacity.
After the leaders took the lead in breaking through the main key problems, the enthusiasm of all the workers in the mine was high, and a leap forward situation in which everyone used their brains and everyone strived for the top immediately appeared. By August 30th, the monthly plan was overfulfilled, and the ore output increased by more than half compared to the original target.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 2nd: After overfulfilling the August steel production plan by 1,341 tons, the 40,000 steelmaking workers in Tianjin are advancing victoriously, determined to increase steel production in September by 19,500 tons compared to August, and to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day with outstanding achievements.
After the publication of the communique and resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, steel plants held meetings for days to mobilize the masses to discuss the steel production plan for September. The largest steelmaking plant in the city—the Second Steel Plant—held a victory report and competition mobilization rally. The workers looked for key problems and proposed measures, making the steel production plan for September 3.4% higher than the original plan. After the workers' discussion, the First Steel Plant's production targets for September, compared with the original plan, increased steel by 14.5% and steel products by 10.66%.
Now, all steel plants are seizing production preparation work and seizing measures to realize the plan. The workers are further developing the competition to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced. (Attached picture)

    钢铁战线展开九月大比武
    总结八月经验部署九月任务  鞍钢职工献计献谋再夺高产
    新华社鞍山1日电　鞍山钢铁公司广大职工再接再厉，决心在9月份生产上打一个更大的胜仗，迎接伟大的国庆十周年，并且为提前超额完成全年的生产计划打下良好基础。
    9月份，鞍钢各项产品的生产指标都比8月份有很大增长。鞍钢党委已经在8月31日召开有厂矿党委书记和厂矿长参加的会议，总结8月份工作经验，部署了9月份的生产。
    在这次会议以前，鞍钢不少厂矿就在狠抓8月最后几天生产的同时，采用大鸣大放大字报的形式，发动群众讨论9月份的增产指标；许多厂矿为了保证完成9月份增产计划，已经从生产技术和管理等方面采取了措施。第一炼钢厂组织专人检查炉体情况，平炉工段成立了青年突击队，专门帮助各炉解决炉体上的关键问题，他们决定在维护好炉体的基础上进一步实行多装快炼措施，力争9月份把生产向前推进一步。第二炼钢厂最近调整了组织机构，把几个总炉长下放到炉上当炉长，使基层生产领导力量更加充实；平炉各班还添设了由优秀的炼钢工人担任的护炉技师，全力加强炉体维护。在这一基础上，这个厂计划从9月1日起，把各炉的装入量从目前的二百九十多吨扩大到三百一十吨，保证平炉大增产。提前完成8月份计划的五座大型固定式平炉的职工，正在全面总结8月份技术大表演的经验，准备在9月份有计划地推广，把生产再提高一步。炼铁厂最近对高炉各项设备普遍进行了检查，并对检查出来的设备缺陷，立即修整，给9月份组织优质高产创造有利条件。获得8月生产大捷的十三个轧钢厂的职工也做了系统的准备工作，保证9月份在生产上创造更大的成就。
    最近四天中，鞍钢的钢产量有三天已经超过或接近9月份更高的日计划水平；钢材的产量更是天天达到了9月份日计划水平；生铁产量也不断提高。这些成就，都给9月份的高产创造了良好的开端。
    重钢广大职工大闹技术革新  保证提前十天完成全年计划
    新华社重庆1日电　重庆钢铁公司全体职工在8月29日举行誓师大会，一致通过了提前十天到十五天分别完成全年各项生产计划的保证书。到会全体职工坚决响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，决定针对巩固攻硫战果，提高炉子寿命，改进冶炼操作，节约原料材料，加强设备维护，加强作业调度，挖掘运输潜力等七大关键，大闹技术革命，大力推广先进经验，开展对手赛和协作竞赛，为实现自己的誓言而奋斗。
    在党的八届八中全会的伟大号召鼓舞下，连日来，重庆钢铁公司全体职工一边热烈讨论本单位如何保证提前和超额完成今年的生产计划，并订出了措施，规定了日期，作为大家努力的目标；另一方面，即抓紧当前生产，马上实现自己的保证。因此，生产捷报频传。全公司炼钢生产的主力——大平炉车间，抓紧炉子刚刚中修的大好时期，坚持贯彻“多装快炼”，以及“站岗放哨、分区负责、三级检查”等先进经验，大干特干。8月27日，四号炉的职工只用了七点四十一分的时间就炼出了一炉好钢，创造了这座炉子开炉以来的最新纪录。中小型轧钢厂的职工，这几天采取了快速轧制钢材的具体措施，在27日就提前四天完成了8月份的生产计划。在誓师大会上，这个厂的职工又提出要在9月份比上月份多产钢材五千吨，并且要在提前完成今年全年计划的基础上，再为国家增产一万吨钢材。
    石钢全体职工决心大干九月  把铁的生产水平提高40％
  新华社1日讯　石景山钢铁公司的职工在8月份取得很大成绩的基础上，决心创造大幅度跃进的成绩迎接伟大的国庆十周年。他们提出的奋斗目标是：在9月份大干三十天，把钢、铁、钢材的生产水平，分别比8月份提高33％、40％和50％。
    党的八届八中全会公报和关于增产节约运动的决议公布以后，这个公司的职工热情奋发，干劲倍加，8月份最后五天中，生铁、焦炭、电炉钢等主要产品的日产量，都创造了今年以来的最高纪录，很多定额纷纷被突破，出现了一片崭新的气象。这个公司党委最近检查了增产节约运动新高潮蓬勃发展的情况，决定领导职工群众继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，抓紧时机，在9月份把钢铁生产提高到更高的水平。
