Mothers Compete to Praise the Commune's Goodness
—A Record of a Kindergarten in the Suburbs of Hefei
By Our Correspondent Dong Ying

In the Jianghuai Brigade of the Feihe Commune in the suburbs of Hefei City, Anhui Province, there are more than a thousand children aged one to seven. But none of these children's mothers are burdened; they can all participate in production full-time, just like the male commune members. When I talked to the mothers about this, they always praised the kindergartens run by the people's commune incessantly.

This brigade mainly produces vegetables, which is highly seasonal and requires a lot of labor. Before the establishment of the commune, some women with stronger labor power were held back by their children.

After the people's commune was established last year, the commune first established full-time kindergartens for the women. In less than a month, the kindergartens received more than 300 children, which freed the mothers from their shackles and enabled them to participate in production with peace of mind. In the past, the "March 8th" production team, which could not finish planting 175 mu of wheat in two months, completed 350 mu in one month; the sweet potato task that would take five days to complete was finished in two days. After women spent most of their time participating in production, the labor shortage situation changed significantly, all aspects of production developed, and income also increased.

Many women told the reporter about the suffering of being unable to participate in production due to being burdened by their children in the past. Wang Linying, the mother of two children, said that because there was no one to take care of her children, she had to take them to the fields to work in the past. When the children went to the vegetable fields, they either pulled out the eggplant seedlings or picked the newly grown tomatoes, so she had to sacrifice her lunch break to replant them for the team. Wang Yingtang, the mother of five children, said that three of her children were in school and two were at home. In the past, she would miss half a month of work every month, earning only a little over ten yuan, which was not enough for food rations, and she had to overdraw her account every month. After the establishment of the commune, the two children who were originally at home were sent to the nursery and kindergarten, respectively, so she could work like everyone else, and her income was more than double what it used to be. This year, she not only solved the problem of food but also made several new clothes for each of her five children, and she will also make new cotton clothes for them in the winter.

Speaking of the children's current happy life, the mothers chimed in, praising the people's commune's goodness. The mother of Hu Keming, an only child, said that she was worried when her child first entered the kindergarten. One evening after work, she secretly went to the kindergarten to see if her child was cold, hungry, or mistreated. At that time, she saw her child crying and refusing to sleep, and the director of the kindergarten was patiently coaxing him. The next day, she told the other mothers that the kindergarten teachers treated the children very well. Two other commune members said that they saw the teachers getting the children up one by one in the middle of the night to urinate, and the children were more comfortable than at home. At home, some young mothers would sleep soundly at night because they were tired from working all day, and the children's bedding would be soaked in the morning. The kindergarten took special care of sick children. Wu Dazhen felt this particularly deeply. Last year, three of her children had measles at the same time. The older one was in the kindergarten and recovered quickly after treatment and careful care; the other two younger ones died because they were not well taken care of at home. Wu Zhenglan said that her child had become disciplined in less than a year in the kindergarten. In the past, he often threw tantrums while eating at home and often spilled food on the ground. Now, when he sees rice grains falling on the table, he picks them up and eats them, saying that they were earned by his parents' labor and should not be wasted.

The reporter visited this kindergarten, which was praised by the mothers. Dozens of rooms are connected together, where children live, learn, and play. There is a bathroom, as well as a clinic and an isolation room. The director of the kindergarten told the reporter that the kindergarten pays special attention to the children's health, often teaches them to develop hygienic habits, and prevents diseases. The Municipal Children's Health Station also regularly sends people to examine the children's bodies or treat diseases. Children who are sick are admitted to the isolation room. Because of good hygiene and medical prevention work, there were no epidemics this summer, and the children are very healthy. We also visited the children's bedrooms and saw mosquito nets hanging on the beds. The kindergarten also raises pigs and fish in a small pond so that the children can eat fresh fish and pork.

### 妈妈争夸公社好——记合肥市郊一个幼儿园

    妈妈争夸公社好
    ——记合肥市郊一个幼儿园	本报记者　董瑛
    在安徽省合肥市郊淝河公社江淮大队，有一至七岁的儿童一千多个。但这些孩子的母亲没有一个受拖累，都能和男社员一样全天参加生产。在我和母亲们谈起这件事的时候，她们总是对人民公社办的幼儿园称赞不绝。
    这个大队以生产蔬菜为主，季节性强，劳动力很缺。在成立公社前，一些劳动力比较强的妇女，都给孩子拖住了腿。
    去年人民公社成立后，公社首先为妇女们成立了全托的幼儿园。不到一个月，幼儿园就接收了三百多个孩子，这样就使母亲们摆脱了羁绊，能够安心参加生产。过去两个月还种不完一百七十五亩麦子的“三八”生产队一个月就种完了三百五十亩；该五天起完的山芋，两天就完成了任务。妇女用大部分时间参加生产后，劳力不足的现象有显著改变，各项生产都有发展，收入也增加了。
    很多妇女向记者诉说过去为孩子拖累不能参加生产的苦处。两个孩子的母亲王琳英说，她因为孩子没人照管，过去她下田生产只好把孩子也带去。孩子到菜地里，不是拔了茄子秧，就是把刚结的西红柿摘了，她只好牺牲中午休息时间给队里补种。五个孩子的母亲王应棠说，她三个孩子上学，两个在家，过去一个月总要误半个月工，只能收入十多元，口粮不够，月月要透支。公社成立后，原来在家的两个孩子，一个送托儿所，一个送幼儿园，可以同大家一样出工，收入比过去多了一倍。今年不仅解决了吃饭的问题，给五个孩子每人都做了几件新衣服，冬天还要给孩子们做新棉衣。
    谈起孩子们现在的幸福生活，母亲们你一言，我一语，同声夸奖人民公社好。独生子胡克明的母亲说，孩子初进幼儿园时，她放心不下。有一天晚上放了工，她偷偷地到幼儿园去看自己的孩子冻着了没有，饿着了没有，受屈了没有。当时，她看到自己孩子哭着不肯睡，幼儿园主任正耐心地哄他。第二天，她就告诉其他的母亲们，幼儿园的老师待孩子真好。另外两个社员说，他们在半夜看到老师们一个个拉孩子起来把尿，孩子们比在家还舒服。在家时，有些年轻的母亲因为白天劳累一天，晚上睡得死，早上起来孩子的被褥就像水淋的一样。幼儿园对生病的孩子照顾得特别周到。这一点，吴大珍的感受特别深。她去年有三个孩子同时出麻疹，大的在幼儿园，经医治和细心照顾，很快就好了；另两个小的因为在家里照顾不好，后来死了。吴正兰说，她的孩子在幼儿园不到一年，懂规矩了。过去在家吃饭时常发脾气，经常把饭洒在地上，现在吃饭时看到有饭粒掉在桌上就捡起来吃，还说这是爸爸妈妈劳动得来的，不能糟塌。
    记者参观了这个被母亲们同声称赞的幼儿园。几十间房子连成一片，孩子们在这里生活、学习和游戏。这里有浴室，还有医务室和隔离室。幼儿园主任向记者说，幼儿园特别注意孩子们身体健康，经常教孩子们养成卫生习惯，预防疾病。市儿童保健站也经常派人来给孩子们检查身体或医治疾病。孩子有了病就住进隔离室。由于讲卫生，医疗预防工作做得好，今年夏天没有什么疾病流行，孩子们都很健康。我们又参观了孩子们的寝室，看到床上都挂着蚊帐。幼儿园还自己养猪，一个小水塘里养了鱼，使孩子们能够吃到鲜鱼和猪肉。（附图片）
