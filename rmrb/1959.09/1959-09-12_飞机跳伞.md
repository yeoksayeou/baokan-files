Aircraft Parachuting

Standing at the door of a high-speed aircraft, facing the glittering mountains, rivers, houses, and fields sliding beneath your feet... jumping down, and descending slowly with a beautiful parachute – this is an enthralling activity in national defense sports: aircraft parachuting.

Parachuting is divided into elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels according to technical proficiency. Elementary and intermediate parachuting involve jumping from parachute towers and hot air balloons, respectively, both of which are not very high above the ground. The term "parachuting" usually refers to aircraft parachuting, i.e., jumping from an airplane.

There are many types of aircraft parachuting events, including single-person precision landing from different heights, group precision landing, single-person combined events, group combined events, high-altitude parachuting, and stunt parachuting. There are events for men and women, held during the day and at night. Precision landing involves athletes jumping from a certain altitude and landing on a designated circle on the ground (the circle's diameter is one-tenth of the altitude). The closer the landing point is to the center of the circle, the better the score. In single-person precision landing, each person jumps twice, and the average distance from the center of the circle is used to calculate the score. Group precision landing involves groups of three or more people (usually three or five). The individuals must maintain a certain distance from each other in the air, stay connected, and the average distance of all individuals from the center of the circle is used to calculate the score (only one jump is performed).

Combined parachuting involves the jumper quickly extending their arms and legs after exiting the aircraft, facing downwards, and maintaining a horizontal body position (with a maximum angle of deviation of forty-five degrees) for a stable descent of twenty seconds before opening the parachute for a precision landing. The athlete's average distance from the center of the circle is also used to calculate the score for combined parachuting. However, the time spent delaying the opening of the parachute and the accuracy of the falling posture also affect the score.

High-altitude parachuting is mostly carried out at altitudes of around 10,000 meters. Parachutists performing high-altitude jumps, especially at night, must not only adapt to the special environment of high altitude without oxygen supply and the force of gravity causing them to fall at 180 kilometers per hour, but also be able to control their bodies in the face of constantly changing wind forces and other weather conditions. The score for high-altitude parachuting is calculated based on the altitude at which the parachutist leaves the aircraft and the length of the freefall without opening the parachute. The highest altitude achieved to date exceeds 15,000 meters, set by Soviet parachutist Nikitin.

Stunt parachuting is the most complex type of parachuting. It is generally performed only as a demonstration, either by individuals or groups. This type of parachuting is mostly carried out at an altitude of 2,000 meters. The delay time for opening the parachute is thirty seconds or longer. Skilled parachutists can perform various advanced maneuvers during this time, such as rotations and parachute changes, which are very thrilling.

Parachuting is a very meaningful sport. It not only cultivates excellent qualities such as courage, fortitude, composure, and resourcefulness in athletes, but also trains a large number of specialized technical personnel for national air transport disaster relief, forest fire prevention, and reserve forces for the air force.

### 飞机跳伞

    飞机跳伞
    站在高速前进的飞机的舱门口，面对着脚下闪闪滑动的山岭、河流、房屋、田野……，纵身往下一跳，撑着美丽的降落伞冉冉下降，这就是国防体育运动中一个引人入胜的项目——飞机跳伞。
    跳伞运动按技术熟练的程度分为初、中、高三级。初级和中级跳伞，是分别从跳伞塔和氢气球上向下跳的，这两种跳伞离地面不太高。通常所说的跳伞运动，是指从飞机上往下跳的飞机跳伞。
    飞机跳伞的项目很多，有不同高度的单人定点、集体定点、单人综合、集体综合、高空跳伞、特技跳伞等。有男子的，有女子的；有在日间举行的，也有在夜间举行的。定点跳伞，是比赛运动员从一定高度的飞机上跳出后，向地面上指定的圆圈着陆（圆圈直径为高度的十分之一），着陆点距圆心越近，成绩越好。单人定点跳伞每人跳两次，以两次距圆心的平均距离计算成绩。集体定点跳伞，是三人以上（通常是三人或五人）编组进行的，几个人在空中要保持一定的距离，相互联系，以几个人距圆心的平均距离计算成绩（只跳一次）。
    综合跳伞，是跳伞员跳出飞机后，迅速伸开手脚，脸朝下，身体保持水平位置（最大差角不得超过四十五度）稳定下降二十秒钟，才打开降落伞，向定点着陆。综合跳伞的成绩也是计算运动员距圆心的平均距离。但在空中延迟开伞的时间和坠落姿势是否准确，对成绩也有影响。
    高空跳伞大多在一万米左右的高空进行。跳伞员在高空、特别是夜间高空跳伞，不仅要适应高空无供氧设备和地心引力以每小时一百八十公里往下坠的特殊环境，而且要善于在风力等气象变化无常的情况下掌握住身体。高空跳伞是根据跳伞员离开飞机时的高度和不张开伞自由坠落的距离长短等计算成绩的。目前最高度已经超过一万五千米，是苏联跳伞员尼基丁创造的。
    特技跳伞是跳伞中最复杂的一项。一般只作表演，有单人的，也有集体的。这种跳伞大多在两千米的高空中进行。延迟开伞的时间为三十秒或者更长。熟练的跳伞员在这段时间内，可以作出各种旋转、换伞等高级动作，十分惊险。
    跳伞运动是一项很有意义的体育运动。它不仅可以培养运动员具有勇敢、坚强、沉着、机敏等优良品质，还可以为国家培养大批空运救灾、护林防火等专门技术人才，并为空军培养后备力量。
