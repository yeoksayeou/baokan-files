    The new school year has begun. Millions of energetic students and a vast number of teachers across the country are starting a new teaching life from today.
    The past year was a year of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and also a year of the Great Leap Forward in education. In the past academic year, while vigorously running full-time schools, various regions across the country also vigorously ran half-day schools and spare-time schools, enabling China's education to achieve unprecedented development. Due to the implementation of the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, the education cause has undergone a profound revolution, and the broad masses of teachers and students are advancing vigorously on the broad road to being both red and expert. In the past academic year, the level of students' academic examination results generally improved significantly compared to the past. Graduates of universities and secondary specialized schools have mostly produced better graduation designs and written better graduation theses. This is the result of the flowering of the Party's educational policy.
    In the new school year, schools should continue to leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in the past academic year, under the guidance of the Party's educational policy, and cultivate students even better.
    Continuing to thoroughly implement the Party's educational policy and continuously improving the quality of education are important tasks of educational work. Although much experience has been gained in this regard, more and newer experience needs to be created. Because different types of schools (universities and secondary specialized schools each have hundreds of majors) have their own characteristics; and students of different levels (ranging from seven years old to over twenty years old) also have their own characteristics. How to implement the Party's educational policy in different schools and different classes is an urgent problem to be solved. For example, how to arrange appropriate content of productive labor according to the requirements of the overall education plan, based on the characteristics of different schools and different classes. At the same time, after students participate in productive labor, how to adapt to this new change, combine book knowledge with labor training, and improve classroom teaching. All this requires continuous exploration, summarizing experience, and formulating specific measures. Schools in various regions should carefully summarize the experience of combining education with productive labor in the past academic year and continue to implement and develop it in the work of the new school year.
    To continue thoroughly implementing the Party's educational policy, it is necessary to strengthen the theoretical education of Marxism-Leninism and strengthen the teaching of political courses. In the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, the broad masses of young students and teachers underwent a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; then, the broad masses of young students and teachers experienced a profound test of the education revolution. The current situation is very good. The revolution on the ideological and political front has achieved a decisive victory. The Party's educational policy has been grasped by the broad masses of teachers and students, and the education revolution has also achieved great results. This requires adapting to the changes in the situation in teaching, strengthening systematic study of Marxism-Leninism theory, and further improving ideological and political level and theoretical level, to consolidate the achievements of the revolution on the ideological and political front and the education revolution. Naturally, in today's new situation, to strengthen systematic study of Marxism-Leninism, it is necessary to continue to implement the principle of linking theory with practice. At any time, in the past, present, and future, the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism must be targeted and must be linked to practice. Some people worry that strengthening systematic theoretical study will lead to dogmatism. This is an excessive worry. It should be known that the so-called dogmatism is essentially a matter of people's attitude towards theory, and a matter of the methods of learning and applying theory. Dogmatism and systematic theoretical study are completely different matters. Those who commit dogmatism are more often due to not having systematic theoretical study, knowing only a little, and being piecemeal. Therefore, young students must strengthen systematic study of Marxism-Leninism theory and arm themselves ideologically and politically. In primary and secondary schools, political courses should be strengthened for children and adolescents so that students can receive socialist and communist ideological and political education in their childhood. It is expected that they will grow up even better into new people who are both red and expert.
    The new school year has begun, and every student must muster greater enthusiasm and strive to learn better than last semester. The motherland cultivates students, hoping that they will become talents who are both red and expert, who can engage in both mental and physical labor, and who are useful to the construction of the motherland. Therefore, students should study hard and become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. Only in this way can they live up to the hopes of the motherland and the people. In the past academic year, students cared about politics, paid attention to labor, and studied diligently. This is a manifestation of high socialist consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm, and it is very gratifying. In the future, this spirit of striving for progress should be maintained and promoted, and hard work should be put into learning. It should be known that learning is not just a personal matter. Students should study for the needs of the motherland. Learning better will allow them to contribute more to the motherland in the future; learning worse may mean they contribute less to the motherland in the future. The main task of students is to study. School social work should be participated in, but time should be arranged reasonably.
    There are millions of teachers in universities, middle schools, and primary schools across the country. At the beginning of the new school year, they will also begin their hard work. The thorough implementation of the Party's educational policy, the improvement of school teaching quality, and the progress of students in politics and academics are inseparable from the hard work of teachers. Teachers should make greater achievements under the leadership of the Party. In order to better carry out teaching work, teachers must continue to improve their ideological and political awareness, continuously carry out self-ideological transformation, and strengthen professional training and practical exercise. The improvement of teachers also means the improvement of students and the improvement of education. It is necessary to strengthen the cooperation between new and old teachers. New teachers should learn modestly from old teachers and overcome the shortcomings of insufficient teaching experience. Both new and old teachers should study diligently, strive to continuously improve the foundation of their subject, and make greater progress in thinking and work, so as to better meet the requirements of teaching.
    The new school year has begun. We hope that the broad masses of teachers and students, after a period of rest, will each put their full energy into teaching life, teach well, and learn well, so that the Party's educational policy will shine even more brilliantly in the new school year.

### 新学年开始了

    新学年开始了
    新学年开始了，全国几千万朝气蓬勃的学生和广大的教师从今天起开始了新的教学生活。
    过去一年，是社会主义建设大跃进的一年，也是教育事业大跃进的一年。在上学年中，全国各地在大办全日制学校的同时，还大办半日制学校、业余学校，使我国的教育事业有了史无前例的大发展。由于贯彻执行党的教育同生产劳动相结合的方针，教育事业经历了深刻革命，广大师生正在又红又专的通衢大道上猛进。上学年，学生学年考试成绩的水平，一般的都比过去有了显著的提高。高等学校和中等专业学校的毕业生，大都作出了较好的毕业设计，写出了较好的毕业论文。这是党的教育方针的开花结果。
    在新学年里，学校要在过去一学年大跃进的基础上，在党的教育方针的指导下，继续跃进，把学生培养得更好。
    继续深入贯彻党的教育方针，不断地提高教育质量。这是教育工作的重要任务。在这方面，虽然已经取得了不少经验，但是还需要创造更多更新的经验。因为，各类不同的学校（高等学校和中等专业学校就各有几百个专业），各有自己的特点；各级不同的学生（从七岁起到二十多岁的不同年龄的差别），又各有自己的特点。党的教育方针如何在不同学校、不同班级贯彻执行，这是迫切需要解决的问题。如怎样按照整个教育计划的要求，根据不同学校、不同班级的特点，安排合适的生产劳动内容。同时，学生参加生产劳动后，如何适应这个新的变化，把书本知识和劳动锻炼结合起来，改进课堂教学工作。这一切都需要不断探索，总结经验，订出具体措施。各地学校应当认真总结过去一学年教育结合生产劳动的经验，并且在新学年的工作中继续贯彻和发展。
    继续深入贯彻执行党的教育方针，必须加强马克思列宁主义的理论教育，加强政治课的教学工作。在整风运动和反右派斗争中，广大青年学生和教师经受了一场在政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的锻炼；接着，广大青年学生和教师又经历了一场深刻的教育革命的考验。目前整个形势很好，思想政治战线上的革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，党的教育方针已经为广大师生所掌握，教育革命也取得了很大的成绩。这就要求在教学上适应形势的变化，加强系统的马克思列宁主义理论学习，进一步提高思想政治水平和理论水平，来巩固思想政治战线上的革命和教育革命的成果。自然，在今天新的形势下，要加强系统的马克思列宁主义学习，必须继续贯彻理论联系实际的原则。在任何时候，在过去，现在，将来，马克思列宁主义的理论学习，必须有的放矢，必须理论同实际相联系。有人担心，加强系统的理论学习，就会犯教条主义，这是过分的忧虑。须知所谓教条主义，实质上是人们对待理论的态度问题，是学习和运用理论的方法问题。教条主义同系统的理论学习，完全是两回事。那些犯教条主义的人，更多的是由于没有进行系统的理论学习，一知半解，零敲碎打的缘故。所以，青年学生必须加强系统的马克思列宁主义理论的学习，从思想政治上来武装自己。在中、小学校里，对少年儿童，要加强政治课的教学，使学生在少年儿童时代，就受到社会主义和共产主义的思想政治教育。可以预期，他们将更好地成长为又红又专的新人。
    新学年开始了，每个学生都要鼓起更大干劲，争取比上学期学得更好些。祖国培养学生，希望学生成为又红又专、既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动的、对祖国建设有用的人材。因此，学生应当努力学习，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。这样才能不辜负祖国和人民的希望。在上学年，学生们关心政治，注意劳动，而且认真读书，这是社会主义觉悟和革命热情高涨的表现，是十分可喜的。今后应该保持和发扬这种努力向上的精神，在学习上下苦工夫。要知道，学习并不只是个人的事情。学生应当是为祖国的需要而学习。学习得好些，将来就可以对祖国贡献得多些；学习得差些，将来就可能对祖国贡献得少些。学生的主要任务是学习，学校的社会工作要参加，但是应当对时间作合理的安排。
    全国现有大、中、小学教师数百万人，这是一支庞大的队伍。新学年开始，他们也就要开始进行辛勤的劳动。党的教育方针的深入贯彻，学校教学质量的提高，学生政治和学业上的进步，都是同教师的辛勤努力分不开的。教师应当在党的领导下，做出更大的成绩。为了更好地进行教学工作，教师就要继续提高自己的思想政治觉悟，不断进行自我思想改造，加强业务修养和实际锻炼。教师的提高，也就意味着学生的提高，意味着教育事业的提高。要加强新老教师的合作。新教师要虚心向老教师学习，克服教学经验不足的缺陷。无论新老教师都要刻苦钻研、争取不断提高本门学科的基础，在思想和工作上得到更大的进步，更好地满足教学的要求。
    新学年开始了。我们希望，广大的教师和学生，经过了一个时期的休息之后，个个以充沛的精力，投入到教学生活中去，要教得好，学得好，让党的教育方针在新的学年发出更加灿烂的光芒。
