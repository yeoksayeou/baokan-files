Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 14th: More than a thousand representatives from all ethnic groups and circles in Lhasa held a rally on the afternoon of the 14th, expressing their firm support for the resolution of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress on the Sino-Indian border issue, fully supporting the position, attitude, and policies adopted by the Chinese government on the Sino-Indian border issue, strongly condemning the Indian army's armed occupation of Chinese territory, and hoping that the Indian side will immediately stop the anti-China agitation that is undermining Sino-Indian friendship and the Five Principles.

Those present pointed out with irrefutable facts that the Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated, that the so-called McMahon Line that the Indian government insists on imposing on China has always been illegal, and that all conspiracies by the Indian government to inherit the mantle of British imperialism and infringe on China's sacred territory will be futile.

The meeting was presided over by Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

Zhang Jingwu, Representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that the recent tense situation on the Sino-Indian border should be entirely the responsibility of the Indian side. He said that in recent years, India has successively occupied the Shipki Pass, Barigas, Sang, Congsha, Poling, Giwa, Qujre, Xiangza, Labude and other areas of China's Tibet region. After the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique launched a rebellion, they invaded Langjiu, Tamadun, Shaze, and Jianzemani in the Maji Dun area of ​​China, and opened fire on our border troops stationed in the Maji Dun area on August 25 this year. Our border troops had no choice but to fight back in self-defense. Zhang Jingwu also said that the Indian army's provocations in the Tibet region of China, the establishment of new outposts, the setting up of "boundary markers," and the connivance of armed Tibetan bandits to carry out harassment, seriously violated China's territory and sovereignty, and undermined the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This behavior has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people.

In his speech, Zhang Jingwu forcefully refuted the Indian government's absurd argument that it unilaterally attempted to use the so-called McMahon Line as the Sino-Indian border, and hoped that the Indian government, like China, would implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated by China and India and immediately stop its acts of aggression against China.

Bainqen Erdini Qoigyijabu, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, who is currently in Xigaze City on official business, delivered a written speech to the conference. He said: "The Indian government 'attempts to impose its own unilateral claims on the border issue on the great Chinese side. It is blinded by greed and cannot even see the Himalayas with its eyes.'" He also said: "China and India are the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and we are friends. The Indian government should not take advantage of our willingness to be friends with you to bully us. Your current actions are not friendly enough."

Zhang Guohua, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and Commander of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, then spoke, expressing his anger at the fact that some people in India were creating a new anti-China wave, that the Indian army was illegally occupying Chinese territory, openly launching armed attacks on border troops, and attempting to impose their unilateral claims on the border issue on the Chinese side. He said: For the past ten years, we have firmly implemented the consistent position of our government on the Sino-Indian border issue. We have not only not changed the long-standing situation on the Sino-Indian border by any means, but also, although China will never recognize the so-called McMahon Line, our border troops have not crossed this line in order to maintain border harmony.

In his speech, Zhang Guohua cited many facts, pointing out that the Indian government has adopted a policy and attitude completely contrary to that of the Chinese government, continuously occupying Chinese territory, and even crossing the so-called McMahon Line in many places. He said that in 1951, the Indian army advanced from Waza to Badi Tong in the south of Chayu in southeastern Tibet (about three kilometers north of Waza) and unilaterally announced to the local people that "the summit of Mount Gengdabala (south of Baimagang in the Tagong area) is the Sino-Indian border." In October 1954, the Indian army penetrated into Sanggarsambo, which belongs to my Jidongzong (the boundary between the Shannan area and the Tagong area), and announced to the local people: Sanggarsambo is the Sino-Indian border; in July 1956, the Indian army that occupied Tawang further occupied the Kejie Lang pasture in Cona County, Shannan area. In the Ali area in western Tibet, the Indian army's activities were even more blatant, openly carrying out armed expansion. In June 1954, the Indian army occupied Wure, in 1955, it occupied Poling, and later it occupied Shipki and other places. From 1951 to 1958, Indian aircraft repeatedly intruded into China's airspace. This series of aggressive activities by the Indian army was unanimously and resolutely resisted by the local residents of China.

Zhang Guohua said that after the original upper-class reactionary group in Tibet launched a full-scale armed rebellion, India's cross-border provocative activities became even more rampant. On July 28 this year, six Indian soldiers invaded the area west of Pangong Lake (west of Ritu Zong in Ali), and were captured by us. They themselves admitted that their mission was to collect information, capture our personnel, and attempt to occupy Chinese territory. In this regard, we still put Sino-Indian friendship first and released them on August 18. On August 13, the Indian army occupied Shaze, southwest of Cona County in Shannan. Although we have repeatedly warned them to withdraw, the Indian army has turned a deaf ear and still occupies it. Prior to this, the Indian army also occupied Tamadun (south of Sanggarsambo), Langjiu and other places. The Indian army that occupied Langjiu openly opened fire on our border troops stationed in the Maji Dun area at 5:55 am Beijing time on August 25. Our border troops had no choice but to fight back. During this period, Indian aircraft also constantly intruded into China's airspace for reconnaissance and other activities. All the facts fully show that it is by no means the Chinese army that occupied India, but the Indian army that occupied Chinese territory. Therefore, there is no question of the Chinese army withdrawing from any location. On the contrary, all the Indian troops and administrative personnel who invaded should withdraw from Chinese territory immediately.

Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, emphasized in his speech that the entire Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, resolutely oppose the so-called "McMahon Line." He said: In 1914, when individual Tibetan officials arbitrarily decided on the so-called "McMahon Line" under the deception of British aggressors, they did not consult with the representatives of the Chinese central government at that time, and the representatives of the central government did not sign it. At that time, the head of the local Tibetan government, the 13th Dalai Lama, did not recognize it at all. The letter from the 13th Dalai Lama to Xia Zha, the official who attended the Simla Conference, can testify to this.

Vice Chairman Pagbalha said that for decades, the entire Tibetan people have been very angry about this illegal and unreasonable boundary line. After India's independence, the original local Tibetan government once sent a telegram requesting the revision of this illegal boundary line. Now, the Indian government openly uses force to occupy our territory. This act of aggression is intolerable. The Tibetan people resolutely support the correct position of our government on the Sino-Indian border issue and are determined to use all their strength to defend the territory of the motherland.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, then spoke. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme was one of the Kālons of the original local government of Tibet, and he used a large number of historical facts to expose the truth about the so-called McMahon Line unilaterally emphasized by the Indian government.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme pointed out that the so-called McMahon Line was a product of British imperialism's attempt to invade Chinese territory. This aggressive line was signed outside the meeting by means of deception and pressure from British representatives, forcing the representatives of the local authorities in Tibet to use secret exchanges of notes. The British government only made this secret exchange of notes public after a long time. After returning to Tibet, the representatives of the local Tibetan authorities who participated in the meeting did not mention the border issue at all. Not to mention the Tibetan people, even the vast majority of monks and lay officials of the original local Tibetan government did not know about it. In the more than 20 years after this secret exchange of notes, the border between Chinese Tibet and India observed the original customary line, and no disputes ever arose. When British imperialist troops began to enter Menda Wang, Baimagang, and other places around 1940, the entire Tibetan people were very angry. The local Tibetan government at that time conducted many negotiations and protests with the British government. After India's independence in 1947, the Indian government and the British government both sent letters to the original local Tibetan government, inquiring about the various treaties on the border, whether they should be implemented according to the old treaties or negotiated separately. At that time, the local Tibetan government convened a meeting of monks and lay officials and representatives of the three major monasteries in Lhasa, and unanimously decided and telegraphed the Indian government, requesting to renegotiate the Sino-Indian border issue. By the time the Changdu area was liberated in 1950, the Indian army hurriedly invaded a large area of territory south of the so-called McMahon Line. Especially after the reactionary upper-class group in Tibet launched a rebellion this year, they crossed the McMahon Line in many places, seriously infringing on China's territory and sovereignty.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that the Indian government must immediately withdraw the troops that have crossed the border from Chinese territory, and fairly and reasonably determine the border line between the two countries through negotiations step by step based on the historical background and the current actual situation.

After Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme's speech, representatives from youth, women, the military, religious circles, citizens, and the Hui people of Lhasa City spoke in succession. They all unanimously and firmly supported our government's position, attitude, and policies on the Sino-Indian border issue, and angrily warned the Indian government to immediately stop its provocative and aggressive acts on the Sino-Indian border issue. They said that for nearly a hundred years, their ancestors have been fighting heroically to defend the integrity of the motherland's territory, and have achieved great victories. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, they are even more confident and determined to join the people of the whole country in defending the integrity of the sacred territory of the motherland.

    拉萨各族各界代表一千多人集会
    希望印度立即停止反华煽动
    据新华社拉萨14日电　拉萨市各族各界代表一千多人14日下午在一次集会上，表示坚决拥护第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于中印边界问题的决议，完全拥护和支持我国政府对中印边界问题所采取的立场、态度和方针，严厉谴责印度军队武装侵占我国领土，并且希望印度方面立即停止破坏中印友好和五项原则的反华煽动。
    到会人士以无可辩驳的事实指出：中印边界从来就没有正式划定过，印度政府坚持要强加于我国的所谓麦克马洪线从来就是非法的，印度政府想继承英帝国主义的衣钵、侵犯中国神圣领土的种种阴谋，都将是枉费心机。
    大会由西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美主持。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武在会上讲了话。他说：最近中印边境上出现的紧张局势，应该由印度方面负完全责任。他说，最近几年来印度先后侵占中国西藏地方的什普奇山口、巴里加斯、桑、葱莎、波林三多、巨哇、曲惹、香扎、拉不底等地区，在西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱以后，又侵入我国领土马及墩地区的朗久、塔马顿、沙则、兼则马尼，并在今年8月25日向我驻马及墩地区的边防军寻衅开火，我边防军队为了自卫才不得不予以还击。张经武还说，印度军队在中国西藏地区越境寻衅，增立哨所，设立“界牌”，纵容西藏武装叛匪进行骚扰，严重侵犯了我国的领土和主权，破坏了和平共处五项原则，这种行为引起了中国人民的极大愤慨。
    张经武在讲话中有力地驳斥了印度政府片面地企图以所谓麦克马洪线作为中印边界的荒谬论调，希望印度政府和我国一样地执行由中印两国首创的和平共处五项原则，立即停止对中国的侵略行为。
    目前因公在日喀则市的西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼向大会发表了书面讲话。他说：“印度政府“企图把自己的关于边界问题的片面主张强加于伟大的中国方面，这是利欲迷住了心窍，有眼也看不见喜马拉雅山了。”又说：“中印两国是和平共处五项原则的创始人，我们是朋友。印度政府不应该利用我们愿意和你们当朋友的心理来欺侮我们，你们现在的作法太不够朋友了。”
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员、中国人民解放军西藏军区司令员张国华接着讲话，他对印度一些人制造新的反华浪潮，印度军队非法侵占我国领土，公然向边防部队进行武装袭击，企图把自己关于边界问题的片面主张强加在中国方面表示愤怒。他说：十年来，我们坚定地贯彻执行了我国政府在中印边界问题上的一贯主张，不仅没有以任何手段改变中印边界久已存在的状况，并且，虽然我国绝不承认所谓麦克马洪线，但为了维持边境的和睦，边防部队也没有越过这条线。
    张国华在讲话中举出许多事实，指出印度政府却采取了与我国政府完全相反的政策和态度，不断侵占我国领土，甚至在很多地方越过了所谓麦克马洪线。他说，1951年印军曾经由瓦扎推进到西藏东南察隅南面巴地筒（在瓦扎北面约三公里处）片面地向当地人民宣布“以更达巴拉山的山顶（在塔工地区白马岗南面）为中印国界”，1954年10月印军曾经深入到我金东宗（山南地区和塔工地区分界处）所属的桑噶尔桑波，对当地人民宣布：桑噶尔桑波是中印国界；1956年7月侵占达旺的印军，还曾经进一步侵占我山南地区错那县所属的克节朗草场。在西藏西部阿里地区，印军活动更加露骨，公然进行武力扩张。1954年6月，印军侵占了我乌热，1955年侵占了波林三多，以后又侵占了我什普奇等地。从1951年到1958年，印度飞机多次侵入我国领空。印度军队这一系列的侵略活动，遭到我国当地居民一致的坚决反抗。
    张国华说，在原西藏上层反动集团发动全面武装叛乱以后，印度越境挑衅的活动更加嚣张。今年7月28日，六名印军侵入我班公湖（在阿里的日土宗的西面）以西所属的地区，被我俘获，他们自己承认入侵的任务是收集资料、俘我人员，企图侵占我国领土。对此，我仍以中印友好为重，于8月18日释放出境。8月13日，印军侵占我沙则，在山南错那县西南面，我们虽然多次警告要他们退出，但印军却置若罔闻，至今仍然侵占着那里。在此以前，印军还侵占了塔马顿（桑噶尔桑波南面）、朗久等地，而侵占朗久的印军竟于8月25日北京时间五点五十五分，公然向我驻在马及墩地区的边防部队开枪袭击，我边防部队不得不被迫还击。在此期间，印度飞机也不断侵入我国领空进行侦察等活动。一切事实充分表明：决不是中国军队侵占了印度，而是印度军队侵占了中国的领土，因此，根本不存在中国军队从任何地点撤出的问题，相反，印度侵入的一切军队和行政人员应该从中国领土上立即撤出去。
    自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰活佛在讲话中强调指出，包括西藏人民在内的全中国人民坚决反对所谓“麦克马洪线”。他说：1914年西藏个别官员在英国侵略者欺骗下擅自决定所谓“麦克马洪线”时，并没有与当时的中国中央政府代表商谈，中央政府代表也没有签字。当时西藏地方当局的负责人十三世达赖喇嘛也根本没有承认，十三世达赖给出席西姆拉会议的官员夏扎的信件就可以作证。
    帕巴拉副主任委员说，几十年来，全西藏人民对于这条既不合法又不合理的边界线一直是十分愤慨的。印度独立后，原西藏地方政府就曾经去电报要求修改这条非法界线，而现在，印度政府公开使用武力，侵占我国领土，这种侵略行为是无法容忍的。西藏人民坚决拥护我国政府关于中印边界问题的正确立场，决心用一切力量保卫祖国的领土。
    自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美接着讲话。阿沛·阿旺晋美是原西藏地方政府的噶伦之一，他用大量历史事实揭露了印度政府片面强调的所谓麦克马洪线的真象。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美指出，所谓麦克马洪线是英帝国主义一手策划的企图侵略中国领土的产物。这条侵略线是在英国代表欺骗和施加压力的手段下，迫使西藏的地方当局的代表用秘密换文的方式在会外签订的，这个秘密换文英国政府过了很长时间才公开。参加会议的西藏地方当局代表在回到西藏以后，对边界问题也根本没有提到，不要说西藏人民，连原西藏地方政府的绝大多数僧俗官员也不知道它。在这个秘密换文以后的二十多年间，中国西藏地方和印度的边界遵守着原来的习惯线，从没有产生过任何纠纷。当1940年左右，英帝国主义军队开始进入门达旺、白马岗以及其他地方时，西藏全体人民十分愤怒，当时的西藏地方政府就曾给英国政府进行了多次的交涉和抗议。1947年印度独立以后，印度政府和英国政府都给原西藏地方政府送来函件，询问关于边界的各项条约，是按照旧条约执行还是另行商谈，当时西藏地方政府召集了僧俗官员和拉萨三大寺的代表举行会议，一致决定并复电印度政府，要求重新谈判中印边界问题。到1950年昌都地区获得解放时，印度军队便急忙侵入所谓麦克马洪线以南的大片领土。特别在今年西藏反动上层集团进行叛乱以后，更是在许多地方越过麦克马洪线，严重侵犯了我国的领土和主权。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说：印度政府必须立即将越境的部队撤出中国的领土，公平合理地、有步骤地根据历史背景和当前的实际情况，通过谈判确定两国边界线。
    在阿沛·阿旺晋美讲话以后，青年、妇女、部队、宗教界、市民和拉萨市回族代表相继讲话，他们一致坚决拥护我国政府对中印边界问题的立场、态度和方针，愤怒地警告印度政府立即停止在中印边界问题上的挑衅和侵略行为。他们说，近百年来，他们的祖先世世代代就一直为保卫祖国领土的完整进行了英勇的斗争，并且取得了伟大的胜利。今天，在中国共产党的领导下，他们更有信心和决心与全国人民一道，保卫祖国神圣疆土的完整。
