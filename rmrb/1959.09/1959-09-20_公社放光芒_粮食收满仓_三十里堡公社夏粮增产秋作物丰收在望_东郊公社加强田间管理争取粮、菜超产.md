The People's Commune Radiates Light: Granaries Overflowing with Grain
Thirty Mile Fort Commune Achieves Increased Summer Grain Production, Autumn Harvest Expected to be Bountiful
East Suburb Commune Strengthens Field Management, Striving for Super Production of Grain and Vegetables

    This newspaper reports that the summer crops of the Thirty Mile Fort People's Commune in Jin County, Liaoning Province, have achieved increased production, and a bumper autumn harvest is expected, fully demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune.
    This commune has more than 11,000 households and over 60,000 people. Last year, as soon as the commune was established, the commune organized tens of thousands of members to engage in a deep plowing campaign, laying a good foundation for this year's harvest. The wheat yield of many teams has doubled compared to last year. In this year's production, due to the commune's unified planning of the entire commune's production and rational arrangement of labor, everyone's talents were utilized. For example, in fruit tree production, the commune transferred 300 fruit tree technicians from the agricultural front, forming 29 fruit tree production teams with more than 800 people participating, solving the contradiction of agriculture and fruit tree production competing for labor during the agricultural production cooperative period.
    Due to unified land management, extremely favorable conditions were created for field planting. The commune divided the 25 management areas into 11 operating areas according to the needs of the state and members and natural conditions, so that land fertility could be fully utilized.
    This commune has undertaken many constructions that agricultural production cooperatives could not accomplish. Relying on strong manpower, material resources, and financial resources, large-scale water conservancy infrastructure construction was carried out. Using 300,000 workdays and 400,000 yuan of funds, the Longkou "August 1st" Reservoir with a water storage capacity of 400,000 cubic meters was built. After the completion of the field canal project, the benefited area will be expanded from 8,000 mu this year to 20,000 mu. Currently, the newly built "Grid Pond" Reservoir, which is one to two times larger than the Longkou "August 1st" Reservoir in terms of labor, investment, and water storage, is also nearing completion with the active support of fraternal communes. The construction of such a huge project, with just the funds alone, is equal to the total annual income of one or two advanced cooperatives before communization. In the past, advanced cooperatives could only sigh at such large-scale water conservancy projects.
    Before the establishment of the commune, several advanced cooperatives had negotiated the construction of the Longkou "August 1st" Reservoir. The Sidaohezi Cooperative, located upstream, first proposed conditions for compensation for losses because the reservoir would flood 1,000 mu of land and require the relocation of 30 households. The Hongguo Cooperative, located downstream and mostly mountainous, proposed that it would do it if water could be brought up the mountains, and not do it if it couldn't. The Youhao and Xincun Cooperatives, which directly benefited downstream, actively advocated the construction of the reservoir, but because the conditions proposed by other cooperatives could not be resolved, it ended without result. The broad masses of commune members deeply felt from these contradictions that the original small cooperatives were no longer suitable for the further development of productive forces and urgently demanded breaking down township and cooperative boundaries. On the basis of the maturity of objective conditions and the "ripe fruit falling from the tree" of the broad masses of peasants' conscious and voluntary will, the people's commune was formed, large-scale reservoirs were built, trunk and branch canals as long as 60 *li* were constructed, and countless capillary canals were built. This year, the power of this powerful drought resistance weapon was fully utilized.
    The establishment of the people's commune not only brought agricultural harvests to Thirty Mile Fort but also opened up a broad road to rural economic prosperity. At present, the number of pigs and chickens raised in the entire commune has more than doubled compared to before communization. The construction of the reservoir has created conditions for the commune to develop fish farming. In addition, the development of sideline production such as beekeeping, transportation, and collection and weaving by commune members' families has promoted changes in the economic outlook of the commune.
    Industrial construction, which is advancing side by side with agriculture, is also developing in the Thirty Mile Fort People's Commune like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Among the more than 300 large and small factories and mines in the entire commune, more than 80% were newly built after communization. For the first time, farmers have their own smelting, machinery manufacturing, pesticide, and fertilizer plants. A large number of deep plows, seeders, weeding machines, water pumps, drilling machines, etc., produced by the commune are continuously supplying the needs of agricultural production.
    The increasingly prosperous economy has brought a rich material and cultural life. From the trial distribution situation, the income of commune members in the first year after communization can increase by an average of 50% per person compared to last year. The purchasing power of commune members has undergone a significant change. The total commercial sales from January to July this year increased by 15.5% compared to the same period last year. The various collective welfare undertakings vigorously carried out by the commune have freed more than half of the total agricultural labor force, more than 9,400 women, from tedious housework and allowed them to participate in the production ranks. The libraries, film projection teams, amateur theatrical troupes, singing teams, and sports teams established by the commune attract a large number of commune members and audiences after work and on holidays. The fatigue of the commune members disappears, and sufficient strength is added to labor. This commune has one hospital, two maternity hospitals, and 27 delivery stations. Each management area has a health clinic, and each production team has a first-aid kit.
    The people's commune has brought harvest and happy life to the people, and the harvest has enhanced people's confidence and courage. The members of the Thirty Mile Fort People's Commune are determined to maintain a growth rate of 15%-20% per year in grain and fruit. (Liu Dexiu)

    This newspaper reports that the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and basic construction of the East Suburb People's Commune in Licheng County, Shandong, have developed rapidly in the past year.
    As soon as the East Suburb Commune was established, it fully demonstrated the superiority of the commune's "large scale and high degree of public ownership." At that time, the production teams in the plains, which grew more wheat, lacked labor. The commune promptly mobilized labor from the mountainous areas, which grew less wheat, so that the entire commune's 50,000 mu of wheat fields were universally deeply plowed, achieving timely sowing and rational close planting. This year's wheat yield per mu has more than doubled compared to last year.
    After communization, land boundaries and village boundaries were broken, and production and cultivation areas were divided according to terrain, labor, and conditions conducive to production, so that land was connected into pieces, giving full play to land fertility. For example, 48 production teams in the plains and low-lying areas concentrated on planting crops such as rice, wheat, and vegetables, and 19 production teams in the mountainous areas concentrated on planting sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains and other drought-resistant crops. After planting according to local conditions, production generally increased by 20%. After communization, the entire commune planted more than 17,000 mu of trees, an increase of 25 times compared to the total of the previous few years before communization. There has also been great development in poultry and livestock. The number of pigs in the entire commune increased from more than 9,300 heads in the first half of the year to more than 15,000 heads, and the number of chickens and ducks increased from 30,000 in the first half of the year to more than 100,000. After the summer harvest this year, this commune has shifted from mainly agricultural production to simultaneously promoting grain, vegetable, and pig production, becoming a non-staple food production base in Jinan City.
    The large scale of the commune and the concentration of manpower, material resources, and financial resources are more conducive to developing production and increasing basic construction. The 14 newly built and expanded farm tool repair and assembly, brick and tile, cement, leather, and clothing factories in the entire commune have a total of more than 1,100 workers. The profit from industrial production in the first half of this year reached more than 190,000 yuan. In addition to being used for factory expansion, all of this money is used as the commune's public accumulation. From last winter to this spring, the entire commune built more than 800 canals, totaling more than 70,000 cubic meters of earthwork, making the ditches and canals connected, and the canals and ponds connected. This changed the situation in the past where it was difficult for people to even drink water in the event of a drought. This commune currently has 27 standard units of tractors, 4 threshers, and 1 seeder. There are also two small hydropower stations, 96 electric motors, and 52 locomotive boilers.
    Due to the bumper harvests of grain and vegetables, the income of production teams and commune members has greatly increased. The income of the Daxin Brigade in the first half of this year exceeded the total income of the entire year last year. The income of commune members has generally more than doubled. For example, in 1958, the Hongjiayuan Brigade had an average cash income of more than 50 yuan per household in addition to grain; while from January to July this year, the average cash income per household was more than 100 yuan excluding food expenses. The commune has also increased many cultural and welfare undertakings. The entire commune has one health center, most production teams have health clinics, and each team has a library, club, and amateur theatrical troupe. Almost every household in many brigades has a crystal radio.
    At present, the broad masses of members of this commune, through the study of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, are actively strengthening the management of late autumn crops and vegetable fields, striving for super production of grain and vegetables.

    公社放光芒　粮食收满仓
    三十里堡公社夏粮增产秋作物丰收在望
    东郊公社加强田间管理争取粮、菜超产
    本报讯　辽宁省金县三十里堡人民公社夏季作物获得增产，大秋作物丰收在望，充分地显示了人民公社的无比优越性。
    这个公社有一万一千多户，六万多人口。去年，公社刚一建立，公社组织成千上万的社员，投入了深翻土地的运动，为今年丰收打下了良好的基础，许多队的小麦产量比去年增产一倍。在今年生产中，由于公社统一筹划了全社的生产，合理安排了劳动力，做到了人尽其才。例如在果树生产上，公社从农业战线上抽调三百名果树技术员，以他们为核心，组成了有八百多人参加的二十九个果树生产队，解决了农业生产合作社时期农业和果树生产争夺劳动力的矛盾。
    由于土地统一经营，为田地种植创造了极为有利的条件。公社根据国家、社员的需要和自然条件，把二十五个管理区，划分为十一个经营区，使地力得到充分发挥。
    这个公社兴办了农业生产合作社力所难及的许多建设，依靠雄厚的人力、物力、财力，进行了大规模的水利基本建设。用三十万个工和四十万元资金，筑成了蓄水四百立方米的龙口“八一”水库，田间渠道工程全部竣工后，受益面积将由今年的八千亩扩大到两万亩。目前新建的，用工、投资、蓄水量都大于龙口“八一”水库一倍到两倍的“格子塘”水库，在兄弟社的积极支援下，也即将竣工。建设这样巨大的工程，只是资金一项，就等于公社化前一两个高级社全年收入的总和。过去高级社对这样大型水利工程，只能望洋兴叹。
    在成立公社以前，几个高级社曾经就修建龙口“八一”水库协商过，处在上游的四道河子社，因修水库要淹没土地一千亩，还要迁出三十户，首先提出了赔偿损失的条件；处于下游，又多是山坡地的红果社，则提出能引水上山就干，不能就不干；下游直接受益的友好社和新村社，虽然积极主张修建水库，但因其他各社提出的条件没办法解决，而不了了之。广大社员群众，就是从这些矛盾中，深深感到原来的小社已经不适应生产力进一步发展的需要，迫切要求打破乡界社界。在客观条件成熟和广大农民群众自觉自愿的“瓜熟蒂落”的基础上，组成了人民公社，建成了大型水库，修筑了长达六十华里的干、支渠道，和无数的毛渠，今年就充分发挥了这一抗旱有力武器的威力。
    人民公社的成立，不仅给三十里堡带来了农业的丰收，还开拓了农村经济繁荣的大道。目前，全社饲养的猪、鸡，已比公社化前增加一倍以上。水库的建成，给公社发展养鱼事业创造了条件。此外，养蜂、交通运输和社员家庭的采集、编织等副业生产的发展，都促进了公社经济面貌的改变。
    同农业并驾齐驱的工业建设，也在三十里堡人民公社像雨后春笋般地发展起来。在全社三百多座大大小小厂矿中，有80％以上是公社化以后新建的，农民们破天荒地有了自己的冶炼、机械制造、农药、肥料厂。公社生产的大批深耕犁、播种机、锄草机、抽水机、打井机等源源不断地供给了农业生产的需要。
    日益繁荣的经济，带来了丰富的物质文化生活。公社化后第一年的社员收入，从试算分配的情况看，平均每人能比去年增加50％。社员购买力发生了显著变化。今年1至7月的商业销售总额比去年同期增长了15.5％。公社大力兴办的各种集体福利事业，使占农业劳动力总数一半以上的九千四百多名妇女，从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，参加了生产行列。公社建立的图书馆、电影放映队和组织起来的业余剧团、歌咏队、球队等，在劳动之后和假日，都吸引了广大社员观众，社员的疲劳消失了，又为劳动增添了充足的力量。这个公社有一处医院，二处妇产院，二十七个接生站，每个管理区设有卫生所，每个生产队设有保健箱。
    人民公社给人们带来了丰收，带来了幸福生活，丰收又给人们增强了信心和勇气。三十里堡人民公社的社员们，决心使粮食和水果每年保持15％—20％的增长速度前进。　　　　　　　（刘德秀）
    本报讯　山东历城县东郊人民公社，农、林、牧、副、渔和基本建设，一年来迅速发展。
    东郊公社一成立，就充分地发挥了公社“一大二公”的优越性。当时种麦多的平原生产队劳力不足，公社及时的从种麦少的山区调集劳力，使全社的五万亩麦田普遍深翻，作到了适时播种和合理密植。今年的小麦亩产量比去年增加了一倍多。
    公社化以后，打破了地界、村界，根据地形、劳力和有利于生产的情况划分了生产耕作区，使土地连成片，充分发挥地力。如四十八个平原和低洼地区的生产队就集中播种水稻、小麦和蔬菜等作物，十九个山区生产队就集中栽地瓜、种杂粮等耐旱作物。因地种植以后，一般的增产二成。公社化以后，全社植树造林一万七千多亩，比公社化前几年的总合增加了二十五倍。家禽家畜也有很大发展。全社生猪由上半年的九千三百多头增加到一万五千多头，鸡、鸭由上半年的三万只增加到十万多只。今年夏收以后，这个社由农业生产为主转为粮、菜、猪生产同时并举，成为济南市副食品生产基地。
    公社规模大，人力、物力和财力集中，更有利于发展生产，增加基本建设。全社新建和扩建的农具修配、砖瓦、水泥、皮革、被服等十四个工厂，共有一千一百多工人。今年上半年工业生产利润达十九万多元，这些钱除用作工厂扩建外，全部为公社的公共积累。去冬今春，全社修筑了八百多条渠道，共七万多土方，使沟渠相通，渠塘相连。改变了过去一遇干旱连人吃水都困难的局面。这个公社现有拖拉机二十七个标准台，脱粒机四台，播种机一台。还有两个小型水力发电站，九十六台电动机，五十二台锅驼机。
    由于粮、菜丰收，生产队和社员的收入大大增加。大辛大队今年上半年的收入就超过去年全年总收入。社员的收入一般都增加了一倍多。如洪家园大队1958年除粮食外，每户平均收入现金五十多元；而今年1月到7月除去吃饭，每户平均收入现金一百多元。公社还增加了许多文化福利事业。全社有一处卫生院，大部分生产队有卫生所，队队有图书室、俱乐部和业余剧团，许多大队几乎家家有矿石收音机。
    目前这个社的广大社员，通过党的八届八中全会公报和决议的学习，积极加强晚秋作物和菜田的管理，争取粮、菜超产。
