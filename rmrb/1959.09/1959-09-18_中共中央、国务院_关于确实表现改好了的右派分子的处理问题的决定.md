    The CCP Central Committee, State Council
    Decision on the Handling of Rightist Elements Who Have Genuinely Reformed
    (September 16, 1959)
      In 1957, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government led the people of the whole country in crushing the frantic attacks of the bourgeois Rightists, exposing a group of bourgeois Rightist elements, and achieving a great victory in the political and ideological fronts of our country's socialist revolution. For the past two years, thanks to the influence of the great victory of the general line of socialist construction in our country, the educational and transformation work of the Party committees and People's Governments at all levels, the supervision and help of the masses of people with a high degree of socialist consciousness, the further consolidation of the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party, and the efforts of the democratic parties, most of the Rightist elements have shown varying degrees of repentance. Some of them have truly recognized their mistakes and have shown in their words and deeds that they have genuinely reformed. On the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, in order to enable these people and other Rightist elements to better transform themselves, to better turn negative factors into positive factors, and to make them feel that under our country's great socialist system, as long as they abandon evil and do good, they all have a bright future, it is now decided: Those Rightist elements who have already abandoned evil and done good, and have shown in their words and deeds that they have genuinely reformed, will no longer be treated as bourgeois Rightist elements in the future, that is, their Rightist hats will be removed. The units they belong to should, based on their performance in work and study, draw conclusions and announce them to the masses.

    中共中央、国务院
    关于确实表现改好了的右派分子的处理问题的决定
    （一九五九年九月十六日）
      一九五七年，中国共产党和人民政府领导全国人民粉碎了资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，揭露出一批资产阶级右派分子，取得了我国社会主义革命在政治战线和思想战线上的伟大胜利。两年以来，由于我国社会主义建设总路线伟大胜利的影响，由于各级党委和人民政府的教育改造工作，由于有高度社会主义觉悟的人民群众的监督和帮助，由于共产党领导的人民民主统一战线的更加巩固和各民主党派的努力，大部分右派分子在目前都有了不同程度的悔改表现。其中一部分人，确实认识了自己的错误，在言论和行动上都表现出确实是改好了。在庆祝伟大的中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，为了使这些人以及其他右派分子更好地进行改造，更有利于化消极因素为积极因素，使他们感到，在我国伟大的社会主义制度下，只要改恶从善，都有自己的光明前途，现在决定：凡是已经改恶从善，并且在言论和行动上表现出确实是改好了的右派分子，对于这些人，今后不再当作资产阶级右派分子看待，即摘掉他们的右派的帽子。他们所在的单位，应当根据他们在工作和学习中的表现，作出结论，在群众中予以宣布。
