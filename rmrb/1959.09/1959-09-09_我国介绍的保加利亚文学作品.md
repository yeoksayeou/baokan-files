Bulgarian literature was introduced to China as early as thirty years ago. In 1921, Mr. Lu Xun began to translate the short stories "Vilka in the War" and "The Village Woman" by the great Bulgarian 19th-century writer Vazov; Mao Dun translated Vazov's short story "Is He Coming?" and Elin Pelin's short story "The Old Ox," which were included in "The Snowman" published in 1928. Wang Luyan also translated short stories by Elin Pelin and other classical writers, which appeared in the "Collection of World Short Stories" published in 1928 and the collection of novels "At the End of the World" published in 1930; Hu Yuzhi also translated a short story by Vazov, "The Lost Evening," which was included in the book "Spark."

During this period, the introduction of Bulgarian literature was mostly scattered in comprehensive collections of novels from various countries or published in magazines. There were not many single-volume publications of Bulgarian literary works. From 1921 to 1946, a period of more than twenty years, only Vazov's "Across the Balkans" was published; famous writer Stamatov's "A Corner of the Soul and Others" and "Seaside Villas and Cemeteries"; Konstantinov's "Bay Ganyo"; and Sun Yong and Yu Daoyuan each translated a collection of Bulgarian short stories. There is nothing else worth mentioning.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China ten years ago, more and more Bulgarian literary works have been translated into Chinese. Bulgarian classical masterpieces that have been translated and published include: the collection of short and medium stories "Old Bulgarians" by the outstanding Bulgarian writer and thinker of the national movement, Karavelov; Vazov's famous novel "Under the Yoke," which describes the Bulgarian people's struggle for national liberation in the 1876 uprising, the novella "Mitrofan and Dormidont," and his collection of poems and essays "Beloved Homeland"; Stamatov's collection of novels "Small Troubles"; Elin Pelin's famous novella "The Land" (including another famous novella "The Gerak Family") and his collection of short stories; and Yovkov's collection of short stories "White Swallows," etc.

More modern works have been published, only a few important works are listed here: In terms of poetry, "Vaptsarov's Selected Poems" has been published. The author is an outstanding proletarian poet, and his poems praise the Bulgarian people's revolutionary struggle and victory; Milev's "September and Others," "September" is a beautiful long poem written by a revolutionary poet about the 1923 uprising. In terms of novels, the novella "Cholera" by the outstanding Bulgarian old writer Stoyanov has been published; Gulyashki's novel "Agricultural Machinery Station," which focuses on the leading role of the Communist Party in the construction of new rural areas and the heroic labor of young people; Venedikov's novella "Second Company," which describes the heroic deeds of the People's Army in the anti-fascist struggle, and his other novel "Flags are Flying on the Sports Ground"; Karaslavov's novella "The Daughter-in-Law"; Petrov's "Nonka"; and "Martinov's Novella Collection."

In addition, some collections of Bulgarian modern novels have been published, such as "In the Bulgarian Countryside," "For Peace," "Morning," "Shepherd Garitko," "Peace Defender" and "Unwelcoming Village," and "Collection of Bulgarian Short Stories," etc.

In terms of drama, two successful scripts by important Bulgarian playwrights have been published, "Paradise on Earth" and "Happiness," and Churyakov's "The First Blow."

In terms of children's literature, "The Banner of Uprising" by Karaliychev, "Little Leader" and "Little Pegasus" by Vasilev, "The Mysterious Key" by Venedikov, "Little Shepherd" by Khashamarchev, "They Became Brave" by Kolanov and "Joy" by Mavrodi have been published. "Bulgarian Folk Tales" and "Selected Bulgarian Folk Songs" have also been published.

Our People's Literature Publishing House has recently published several famous Bulgarian modern literary works:

"On Literature, Art and Science" by Dimitrov, one of the leaders of the international working class and the great Bulgarian revolutionary; "Botev's Poetry Collection" and "Smirnenski's Poetry and Prose Collection." The novels published include "Tobacco" (which won the Dimitrov Prize First Class), a work by the famous modern Bulgarian writer Dimov depicting the life and struggle of the broad working people, and "Agricultural Machinery Station" by Gulyashki.

    我国介绍的保加利亚文学作品
    我国介绍保加利亚文学，早在三十多年以前，1921年鲁迅先生就开始译过保加利亚十九世纪伟大作家伐佐夫的短篇小说“战争中的威尔珂”和“村妇”；茅盾曾译过伐佐夫的短篇小说“他来了么？”和埃林·彼林的短篇小说“老牛”，编入在1928年出版的“雪人”中。王鲁彦也译过埃林·彼林等古典作家的短篇小说，见于1928年出版的
  “世界短篇小说集”和1930年出版的小说集
  “在世界的尽头”里；胡愈之也译过一篇伐佐夫的短篇小说“失去的晚间”，收入“星火”一书中。
    在这一段时期，介绍保加利亚文学，多半是零星散编在各国综合的小说集内，或刊在杂志上，保加利亚文学作品单行本出版的不多，从1921年至1946年二十余年期间，仅出版了伐佐夫的“过岭记”；著名作家斯泰马托夫的“灵魂的一隅及其他”和“海滨别墅与公墓”；康斯坦丁诺夫的“甘佑先生”；以及孙用和于道源等各译了一本保加利亚短篇小说集，此外就没有什么可谈了。
    自中华人民共和国建国十年以来，翻译成中文的保加利亚文学作品，就越来越多了。保加利亚古典名著已翻译出版的有：保加利亚卓越作家、民族运动思想家卡拉维洛夫的中短篇小说集“旧日的保加利亚人”；伐佐夫的写保加利亚人民争取民族解放的1876年起义的著名长篇小说“轭下”、中篇小说“米特洛芬和陶尔米道尔斯基”及他的诗文集“可爱的祖国”；斯泰马托夫的小说集“小纠纷”；埃林·彼林的著名中篇小说“大地”（包括另一著名中篇小说“盖拉克一家”）和他的短篇小说集；以及育符柯夫的短篇小说集“白燕”等。
    现代作品出版的较多，只举出几种重要作品：诗歌方面出版了“瓦普察洛夫诗选”，作者是杰出的无产阶级诗人，诗中歌颂了保加利亚人民的革命斗争和胜利；米列夫的“九月及其他”，“九月”是革命诗人写1923年起义的优美的长诗。小说方面出版了卓越的保加利亚老作家斯托扬诺夫的中篇小说“霍乱”；古里雅希基的长篇小说“农业机器站”，书中着重写共产党在新农村建设中的领导作用及青年英勇的劳动；维任诺夫写人民军队反法西斯斗争中表现了英勇事迹的中篇小说“第二连”和他的另一本小说“旗帜在运动场上飘扬”；卡拉斯拉沃夫的中篇小说“儿媳妇”；彼得洛夫的“侬卡”，以及“马丁诺夫中篇小说集”。
    此外还出版了一些保加利亚近代小说集，如“在保加利亚农村里”、“为了和平”、“早晨”、“牧童加里特柯”、“和平保卫者”和“不好客的村庄”，及“保加利亚短篇小说集”等。
    在戏剧方面出版了保加利亚重要剧作家的两个成功的剧本“人间乐园”和“幸福”、丘里亚科夫的“第一次打击”。
    在儿童文学读物方面，出版了卡拉里契夫的“起义的旗帜”、瓦西列夫的“小领袖”和“小飞马”、维任诺夫的“神秘的钥匙”、哈谢马尔切夫的“小牧童”、科拉诺夫的“他们成为勇敢的人”和马符罗季的“欢乐”等。还出版了“保加利亚民间故事”和“保加利亚民歌选集”。
    我国人民文学出版社新近出版了几种保加利亚现代文学名著：
    国际工人阶级的领袖之一、保加利亚的伟大革命家季米特洛夫的“论文学、艺术与科学”；“波特夫诗集”，和“斯米尔宁斯基诗文集”。长篇小说出版了保加利亚现代著名作家狄莫夫描写广大劳动人民生活与斗争的“烟草”（本书曾获季米特洛夫奖金一等奖）及古里雅希基的“农业机器站”。
