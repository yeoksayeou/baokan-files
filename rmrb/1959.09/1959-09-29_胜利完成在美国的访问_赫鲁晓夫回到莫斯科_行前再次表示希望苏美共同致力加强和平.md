Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th: TASS reports: After concluding his talks with U.S. President Eisenhower, Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers Khrushchev left Camp David at 2:12 PM (local time, same hereafter) on September 27th and arrived in Washington at 3:29 PM.

U.S. President Eisenhower arrived in Washington together. Eisenhower accompanied the distinguished guest to Blair House. He bid farewell to Khrushchev at the entrance of Blair House and wished him a safe journey home.

At 4:05 PM, Khrushchev held a press conference in the hall of the National Press Club in Washington. More than 300 reporters from American and foreign newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and television stations attended the press conference. At the beginning of the press conference, the joint communiqué of the Khrushchev-Eisenhower talks was read out.

Khrushchev briefly spoke about his visit to the United States and then answered questions from reporters.

At 6:00 PM, Khrushchev delivered a speech on American television. At 10:00 PM, Khrushchev and his entourage boarded a "Tu-114" aircraft at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington and departed for Moscow.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th: TASS reports: Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers Khrushchev and his entourage departed from Washington for Moscow at 10:00 PM (Washington time) on September 27th aboard a "Tu-114" airliner.

Tens of thousands of people gathered at Andrews Air Force Base to bid farewell to Khrushchev and his entourage, who had been visiting the United States for thirteen days.

The flags of the Soviet Union and the United States were displayed at the airport. Lined up on the square where the farewell ceremony was held for the Soviet guests were the U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force detachments, as well as flag bearers holding the flags of each U.S. state. Those who came to the airport to see them off included U.S. Vice President Nixon and his wife, Secretary of State Herter and his wife, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Lodge, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining, Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in the United States Sanas and his wife, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Menshikov, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Thompson and his wife, as well as Chief of Protocol of the U.S. Department of State Buchanan and his wife, personnel from the Soviet Embassy in the United States, and officials from the U.S. Department of State.

After Khrushchev arrived at the airport, U.S. Vice President Nixon welcomed the Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers and invited him to the podium. At this time, the armed forces standing on the square began to receive the review. The band played the Soviet national anthem and the American national anthem. A twenty-one-gun salute was fired.

Nixon then approached the microphone. He said that before Khrushchev came to the United States, there were differences between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. These differences still exist. He emphasized that, however, this visit provided the leaders of the two major powers with the opportunity to meet and discuss the differences between the two countries. Nixon went on to say that the use of force to resolve disputes is currently unimaginable. Nixon also said that shortly before Khrushchev came to the United States, the American people had expressed admiration for the success of the lunar rocket launched by Soviet scientists. Now the American people are equally amazed by the vitality and energy that Khrushchev has shown during his busy thirteen-day visit to the United States. Nixon asked Khrushchev to convey the American people's respect to the Soviet people.

Then Khrushchev spoke. Khrushchev said, "Our visit to the United States has come to an end. We visited the United States at the kind invitation of U.S. President Eisenhower. We have visited cities across your country from the Atlantic to the Pacific, held many pleasant meetings with Americans, held discussions with business people, politicians, and social figures, and met with workers, farmers, and intellectuals.

"We held useful talks with President Eisenhower and agreed that all outstanding international issues should be resolved by peaceful means, through negotiations, rather than through the use of force.

"After we return home, we will tell the Soviet people about our impressions, meetings, and talks in the United States. The entire Soviet people long for a peaceful life and hopes to establish friendly relations between our two great nations. We are convinced that the American people also desire peace.

"In our relations, there are many complex and unresolved issues, but let us not look back, but look forward, and do everything we can to make things better. Let us unite our strength to strengthen peace and promote mutual understanding among all countries of the world.

"Thank you sincerely for your hospitality. I hope that in the relations between our two countries, we will use the short and good American word 'OK' more frequently.

"Goodbye, friends!"

Then Khrushchev and his wife stepped down from the podium and warmly bid farewell to the people who came to see them off. Khrushchev and Khrushchev, as well as U.S. Vice President Nixon, walked towards the car, and the car slowly drove towards the plane. Next to the plane, Khrushchev warmly bid farewell to U.S. Vice President Nixon once again.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th: Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers Khrushchev and his entourage returned to the Soviet capital from the United States today aboard a "Tu-114" aircraft.

The "Tu-114" aircraft landed at Vnukovo Airport at 3:28 PM Moscow time. Khrushchev met with the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, foreign diplomatic envoys, and many representatives of the working people at the airport.

Comrade Khrushchev and his party then drove to the Lenin Central Stadium to participate in a mass rally held by the working people of Moscow City and Moscow Oblast to welcome Khrushchev's return from his visit to the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: TASS reports: Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers Khrushchev sent a telegram to U.S. President Eisenhower as the "Tu-114" airliner took off for home and flew over U.S. territory, expressing his gratitude for the hospitality he received during his visit to the United States.

The telegram stated: "It has been very interesting and beneficial for us to understand the life of the American people. The exchange of views on the most important international issues and on Soviet-American relations shows that the desire to take the necessary efforts to eliminate the Cold War and to establish trust and mutual understanding between our two countries is becoming increasingly dominant. Our meeting will undoubtedly promote the easing of international tensions and the consolidation of universal peace. Mr. President, I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you and to the American people for your hospitality. I assure you that when you come to the Soviet Union in the future, the Soviet people and the Soviet government will give you the same gracious reception."

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko sent a telegram to U.S. Secretary of State Herter, which stated: "I believe that Khrushchev's visit to the United States and Mr. Eisenhower's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union will be of great significance for easing and improving relations between our two countries and for strengthening world peace."

    胜利完成在美国的访问
    赫鲁晓夫回到莫斯科
    行前再次表示希望苏美共同致力加强和平
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫结束了他同美国总统艾森豪威尔的会谈以后，9月27日下午二时十二分（当地时间，下同）离开了戴维营，在下午三时二十九分到达华盛顿。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔一同抵达华盛顿。艾森豪威尔一直陪同贵宾到布莱尔大厦。他在布莱尔大厦门口同赫鲁晓夫告别，并祝赫鲁晓夫回国时一路平安。
    下午四时五分，赫鲁晓夫在华盛顿全国新闻俱乐部大厅举行了记者招待会。出席记者招待会的有美国和外国的报纸、杂志、广播电台和电视台的三百多名记者。在记者招待会开始的时候宣读了赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔会谈联合公报。
    赫鲁晓夫扼要地谈到了他的访美情况，然后回答了记者们的问题。
    下午六时赫鲁晓夫在美国电视台发表了演说。下午十时，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员在华盛顿附近的安德鲁斯军用机场乘“图—114”飞机启程回莫斯科。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员27日晚上十时整（华盛顿时间）乘“图—114”客机从华盛顿回莫斯科。
    成千上万的人聚集在安德鲁斯军用机场上为访问美国十三天的赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员送行。
    机场上悬挂着苏美两国国旗。在为苏联客人举行送行仪式的广场上列队站着美国海军陆战队、美国陆、海、空军的队伍，以及手执美国各州州旗的旗手。到机场送行的有美国副总统尼克松和夫人、国务卿赫脱和夫人、美国驻联合国常任代表洛奇、参谋长联席会议主席特文宁、驻美国外交团团长萨纳斯和夫人、苏联驻美国大使缅希科夫、美国驻苏联大使汤普森和夫人以及美国国务院典礼局局长布坎南和夫人，苏联驻美国大使馆人员和美国国务院官员。

    尼克松接着走近扩音器。他说，在赫鲁晓夫到美国来以前，美苏之间存在着分歧。这些分歧现在仍然存在。他强调说，但是，这次访问使两大国首脑有了彼此会晤和讨论两国之间存在的分歧的机会。尼克松接着说，目前用武力来解决争执问题是不可想像的。尼克松还说，在赫鲁晓夫到美国来以前不久，美国人民曾对苏联科学家发射的月球火箭成功表示过景仰。现在美国人民对赫鲁晓夫在访问美国的紧张的十三天中所表现出来的活力和精力同样地也感到惊异。尼克松请求赫鲁晓夫向苏联人民转达美国人民的敬意。
    接着赫鲁晓夫讲话。赫鲁晓夫说，“我们在美国的访问已经结束了，我们是应美国总统艾森豪威尔先生的盛情邀请到美国访问的。我们访问了你们国家的从大西洋到太平洋的各城市，同美国人举行过许多愉快的会见，同实业界人士、政治家和社会人士举行了座谈，会见了工人、农民和知识分子。
    “我们同艾森豪威尔总统举行了有益的会谈，双方同意，一切悬而未决的国际问题都应该用和平手段，通过谈判来解决，而不是通过武力的途径来解决。
    “我们回国以后，将告诉苏联人民关于我们在美国的印象、会见和谈话。全体苏联人民都渴望过和平生活，希望在我们两大国之间建立友好关系。我们确信，美国人民也希望和平。
    “在我们的关系中，有不少复杂的悬而未决的问题，但是，让我们最好不要向后看，而要向前看，尽一切努力把事情做好。让我们把力量联合起来来加强和平，促进世界各国之间的相互谅解。
    “衷心感谢你们对我们的殷勤款待。我希望在我们两国之间的关系中，更频繁地运用美国这个简短的好字眼：‘OK’。
    “再见吧，朋友们！”
    接着赫鲁晓夫和他的夫人走下了讲台，和送行的人热情告别。赫鲁晓夫和赫鲁晓娃以及美国副总统尼克松走向汽车，汽车缓缓地开向飞机。在飞机旁赫鲁晓夫再一次和美国副总统尼克松热情告别。

    赫鲁晓夫同志等一行随即驱车前往列宁中央运动场，参加莫斯科市和莫斯科州劳动人民为欢迎赫鲁晓夫访美归来而举行的群众大会。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在乘坐
  “图—114”客机启程返国飞越美国国境时打了一封电报给美国总统艾森豪威尔，对他这次访问美国所受到的款待表示感谢。
