Starting from Scratch, Building from Nothing, Great Leap Forward in Steelmaking is Excellent
Shandong Leaps to Become a Key Iron-Producing Province in One Year

(Report from our newspaper) Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Shandong Province has, in a short period of over a year, gone from having no iron to having iron smelting furnaces scattered everywhere, leaping to become one of the key iron-producing provinces in the country.

From January to August this year, the province produced 810,852 tons of pig iron, 97,719 tons of steel, and 68,296 tons of rolled steel, an increase of 35.5 times in pig iron, 4.6 times in steel, and 56.77% in rolled steel compared to the same period last year.

Since last winter and this spring, Shandong Province has comprehensively rectified, consolidated, and technically innovated the iron and steel industry developed during the Great Leap Forward in Steelmaking, based on principles such as proximity to mines, proximity to coal, and convenient transportation. At the same time, it has planned and newly built a number of medium and small-sized blast furnaces, initially forming iron and steel production bases in Jinan, Zibo, Qingdao, and other places. The province has a total of 707 blast furnaces ranging from 3 cubic meters to 255 cubic meters, with a total volume of 5,766 cubic meters; 42 converters ranging from 0.5 tons to 3 tons, plus 8 electric furnaces, with a total capacity of 75.4 tons; and 17 rolling mills. In addition, there are four 55-cubic-meter blast furnaces and one 100-cubic-meter blast furnace under construction, as well as four 6-ton converters, which will be put into production successively in the fourth quarter of this year. Coupled with 51 mines exploited using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, 3,840 Kailuan-style coking ovens, and 134 simple No. 2 coke ovens that have been completed or are basically completed, Shandong's iron and steel production has developed from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups," with small and medium-sized blast furnaces rapidly replacing indigenous blast furnaces, laying a preliminary foundation for the great development of modern iron and steel industry.

Before the Great Leap Forward in Steelmaking last year, the broad masses of people in Shandong knew almost nothing about iron and steel production. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the instructions of the Central Committee and proceeding from reality, adhered to the principle of starting with small-scale indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and developing from indigenous to foreign in a planned and gradual manner, cultivating technical forces and conducting a general survey of geological resources, enabling the iron and steel industry to overcome numerous difficulties and achieve considerable development. The broad masses of workers on the iron and steel front in Shandong Province, on the one hand, humbly learned from the advanced experiences of fraternal provinces and cities in iron and steel production; at the same time, they initially explored a set of practical experiences for high quality and high yield. Jinan City, due to fully mobilizing the masses and carrying out technical transformations of small blast furnaces based on "two-ifications and five-determinants," and strengthening enterprise management, carried out a series of work from raw material processing management to smelting technical operations, achieving significant results. As a result, many small blast furnaces with high quality, high yield, and low cost have emerged in the city. For example, the 13-cubic-meter "Crossing the River" small blast furnace of the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee Iron Smelting Plant achieved a utilization coefficient of 1.25, a quality qualification rate of 93.19%, a coke ratio of 0.08, and a cost of 210 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 fen per ton. Small converters from 0.5 tons to 1.5 tons in Qingdao City universally promoted the experience of hot-blast alkaline iron-making furnaces and alkaline furnace linings, using about 0.5% high-sulfur iron to produce more than 90% qualified steel ingots, with a furnace life of up to 60 times. These effective advanced experiences of high quality, high yield, and low cost have been fully promoted throughout Shandong Province.

After the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the iron and steel army of the whole province was full of vigor, and iron and steel production soared. From September 1st to 20th, the average daily output of pig iron reached 5,268 tons, an increase of 42.1% compared to the average daily output in August, and the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces reached above 1; the average daily output of steel reached 828.1 tons, an increase of 45.8% compared to the average daily output in August. At present, the counterpart competitions between factories, workshops, and furnaces are vigorously unfolding, determined to present new achievements in overfulfilling the state plan for the third quarter to celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

### 平地起家　从无到有　大炼钢铁好得很  山东一年跃为重点产铁省

    平地起家　从无到有　大炼钢铁好得很
    山东一年跃为重点产铁省
    本报讯　山东省自去年大跃进以来，在短短一年多时间内，从手无寸铁到炼铁高炉星罗棋布，一跃而为全国产铁的重点省份之一。
    这个省今年1至8月份已经生产生铁八十一万零八百五十二吨，炼钢九万七千七百一十九吨，轧制钢材六万八千二百九十六吨，与去年同期相比，生铁增长三十五点五倍，钢增长四点六倍，钢材增长56.77％。
    自去冬今春以来，山东省对大炼钢铁运动中发展起来的钢铁工业，根据就矿、就煤和交通便利等原则，普遍进行了整顿、巩固和技术革新工作，同时，有计划地新建一批中、小型高炉，初步形成济南、淄博、青岛等钢铁生产基地。全省共有三立方米以上二百五十五立方米以下的高炉七百零七座，总容积五千七百六十六立方米；零点五吨以上三吨以下转炉四十二座，加上电炉八座，总容量为七十五点四吨；轧钢机十七台。此外还有正在建设的五十五立方米高炉四座，一百立方米高炉一座，六吨转炉四座，这些高炉将在今年第四季度相继投入生产。再加上用土洋结合方法开采的矿山五十一处，开滦式炼焦炉三千八百四十座，建成和基本建成的二号简易焦炉一百三十四座，就使山东省钢铁生产由“小土群”发展到“小洋群”，中小高炉迅速代替了土高炉，为现代化钢铁工业的大发展初步奠定了基础。
    在去年大炼钢铁运动以前，山东广大人民对钢铁生产的知识，几乎一无所知。中共山东省委根据中央指示，从实际出发，坚持先从小型土法开始，土洋结合，由土到洋的发展方针，有计划地逐步培养技术力量，普查地质资源，使钢铁工业克服重重困难，得到长足的发展。山东省钢铁战线上的广大职工，在钢铁生产上一方面虚心学习兄弟省、市的先进经验；同时，初步摸索出一套切合实际情况的优质高产经验。济南市由于充分发动群众，在二化五定基础上，对小高炉进行技术改造，加强企业管理，从原材料加工管理直到冶炼技术操作，都进行了一系列工作，收得显著效果，因而这个市出现了不少优质高产低成本的小高炉。如省委、省人委炼铁厂的十三立方米渡江号小高炉利用系数达到一点二五，质量合格率为93.19％，焦比零点零八，成本每吨二百一十元一角三分。青岛市零点五吨到一点五吨的小转炉，普遍推广热风碱性化铁炉和碱性炉衬的经验，用0.5％左右的高硫铁能炼出90％以上的合格钢锭，炉龄达到六十次之多。这些行之有效的优质、高产、低成本的先进经验，已在山东全省各地全面推广。
    党的八届八中全会的决议公布后，全省钢铁大军干劲冲天，钢铁生产扶摇直上。9月1至20日生铁的平均日产量达五千二百六十八吨，比8月平均日产量提高42.1％，高炉利用系数达到一以上；钢的平均日产量达八百二十八点一吨，比8月的平均日产量提高45.8％。目前，厂与厂、车间与车间、炉与炉之间的对口赛正在蓬勃开展，决心以超额完成第三季度国家计划的新成绩来向伟大的建国十周年献礼。（附图片）
