Xinhua News Agency, September 16th – The gymnastics competition of the First National Games, held at Shishahai in Beijing, concluded this evening after three days of intense competition. The results of the competition show that the Anhui team won the overall team score championship and the individual exercise championship. Guangdong team's athletes Tan Wumin and Chen Siji won the men's pair gymnastics championship. Fujian team's athletes Du Huixiong and Liu Chunping (female) won the mixed doubles gymnastics championship, and Liaoning team's athlete Zeng Xianyi won the men's singles gymnastics championship. The women's singles gymnastics champion was twelve-year-old Ding Zhaofang from the Anhui team, who surpassed the twenty-five other competitors with a total score of 72.9 points.

This gymnastics competition was conducted at a very high level. The one hundred and twenty-nine male and female athletes from the seventeen participating teams had to complete eight routines (three compulsory routines, three optional routines, and two free exercise routines). The regulations for these routines are stricter than in the past.

This gymnastics championship battle was very fierce, and many newcomers defeated veterans. For example, twelve-year-old Ding Zhaofang from Anhui, who had been training for less than a year, surpassed Jiangsu's Zhu Peilan, the champion of last year's mixed doubles gymnastics competition, by 0.95 points in the three compulsory gymnastics routines. Later, Zhu Peilan took the lead in free exercise, but in the three individual optional routines held this afternoon, Ding Zhaofang regained the advantage and won the women's singles gymnastics championship.

    技巧运动比赛结束
    据新华社16日讯　第一届全国运动会在北京什刹海举行的技巧运动，经过三天激烈的争夺战，今天晚间结束。比赛结果，安徽代表队夺得团体总分冠军和动作单项冠军。广东代表队的选手谭伍民、陈斯骥获得男子双人技巧冠军。福建代表队的选手杜辉雄、刘春平（女）获得男女混合双人技巧冠军，辽宁代表队的选手曾宪义获得男子单人技巧冠军。获得女子单人技巧冠军的是安徽代表队的十二岁的丁照芳，她以总分七二点九分的成绩超过和她竞争的二十五名选手。
    这次技巧比赛是在很高的水平上进行的。参加竞赛的十七个代表队一百二十九名的男女选手都必须完成八套动作（三套规定动作，三套自选动作，两套自由操动作）。这些动作的规定都比以往严格。
    这次技巧锦标争夺战非常激烈，出现了许多新手战胜老手的情况。例如锻炼不到一年的十二岁的安徽选手丁照芳在三项规定技巧动作中，以零点九五分的优势胜过了去年参加男女混合技巧竞赛的冠军的江苏女选手朱佩兰。而后在自由操中又为朱佩兰占先，到今天下午进行的个人自选三套动作中，丁照芳又夺得了优势，荣获女子单人技巧运动的冠军。
