Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 4th - According to preliminary statistics here, Bulgaria's national income this year will increase to two and a half times that of the pre-liberation year of 1939, an increase of about 7% compared to 1958.

Since liberation, with the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production, the national income, which is the only source for expanding reproduction and improving the material welfare of the people, has also increased year by year. The national income in 1958 increased by 1.42 times compared to 1939. From 1948 to 1957, the national income increased by 1.2 times, with an average annual increase of 9%, which is one to one and a half times faster than the average annual growth rate during the "prosperous" years (1929-1933) of capitalist Bulgaria's economy. In 1958, workers' wages increased by 72% compared to 1952; the average income of each worker's family increased by 70% compared to 1953. The increase in the actual income of agricultural cooperative members is very significant. In 1958, the average income of each farmer increased by nearly 90% compared to 1953.

The tremendous development of the socialist economy has enabled the Communist Party and the government to increase the real income of the people by lowering prices. For example, from 1952 to 1957, the working people benefited from several price reductions totaling 6.93 billion leva (Bulgarian currency). The reduction in the prices of certain industrial products and electricity in November 1958 brought the working people benefits of approximately 7 billion leva.

Currently, Bulgaria has surpassed countries such as West Germany, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey in terms of per capita consumption of major food items. In 1958, the personal consumer goods obtained by the working people more than doubled compared to 1948. Currently, Bulgaria's per capita meat production has exceeded that of Italy, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and other countries. Compared to 1952, Bulgaria's sales of radios have increased eleven to twelvefold.

The increase in the real income of the working people is also reflected in the development of savings. In 1944, the total amount of residents' deposits was over 950 million leva, with 1.465 million depositors. In 1958, the total amount of deposits increased to 4.4 billion leva, and the number of depositors increased to over 5 million. Currently, two out of every three people in Bulgaria have savings, with an average deposit of 880 leva, equivalent to 150% of the average monthly wage of each worker. In the total savings in the first quarter of this year, rural residents accounted for 63%.

The Bulgarian Party and government have shown tireless concern for improving the material welfare of the working people. In 1958, the state expenditure on social and cultural facilities doubled compared to 1952. All residents of the country enjoy free medical treatment. For the first time, members of agricultural cooperatives can also receive pensions.

In order to improve the people's living conditions, a total of 528,133 houses were newly built across the country between 1945 and 1958. During the era of the people's regime, the number of houses built in rural areas in Bulgaria is equal to the total number of houses built during the seventy years of bourgeois rule before liberation.

The medical and health conditions of the Bulgarian people have also greatly improved. Currently, there is one doctor for every 794 residents in the country, while the average in European capitalist countries is one doctor for every 950 people. Almost all rural areas in Bulgaria now have health centers, and 263 rural areas also have modern hospitals. In the past, there were no maternity hospitals in rural areas at all, but now, in addition to opening 704 maternity hospitals, there are also obstetrics departments in 268 regional hospitals.

Due to the improvement of the people's material welfare and the development of medical services, the health of the residents has also improved. In terms of the average life expectancy of the people, Bulgaria has surpassed a series of capitalist countries. In 1956-1957, the average life expectancy for men was 64 years old, and for women it reached 68 years old. Compared with the pre-war period of 1935-1939, the average life expectancy for men increased by 13 years, and for women by 16 years. Bulgaria is now one of the countries with the lowest infant mortality rate in the world, with the infant mortality rate reduced by two-thirds compared to before liberation.

    工业农业生产发展　人民收入不断提高
    保加利亚人民生活日益富裕
    新华社索非亚4日电　据此间的初步统计，今年保加利亚的国民收入将增加为解放前1939年的二倍半，比1958年增加约7％。
    解放以来，随着工农业生产的不断发展，作为扩大再生产和提高人民物质福利的唯一来源的国民收入也在逐年增加。1958年的国民收入比1939年增加一点四二倍。从1948年到1957年，国民收入增加了一点二倍；平均每年增加9％，比资本主义的保加利亚经济“繁荣”年代（1929—1933）每年平均增长速度快一到一倍半。在1958年，工人的工资比1952年提高了72％；每个工人家庭的平均收入比1953年增加了70％。农业合作社社员实际收入的增加十分显著。1958年，每个农户的平均收入比1953年增加了将近90％。
    社会主义经济的巨大发展，使得共产党和政府能够通过减低物价的办法，来提高人民的实际收入。例如，从1952年到1957年，劳动人民就从几次减低物价中获益六十九亿三千万列弗（保币）。1958年11月减低某些工业用品和电力的价格，又使劳动人民得到了约七十亿列弗的好处。
    现在，保加利亚在最主要食品按人口平均计算的消费量方面，已经超过了西德、法国、意大利、希腊、土耳其等国家。1958年劳动人民得到的个人消费品，比1948年增加了两倍多。现在，在按人口平均计算的肉类产量方面，保加利亚已超过意大利、西班牙、葡萄牙、土耳其等国。同1952年相比，保加利亚现在收音机的销售量增加了十一到十二倍。
    劳动人民实际收入的增加还反映在储蓄事业的发展上。1944年，居民存款总额为九亿五千多万列弗，存款人为一百四十六万五千人。1958年，存款总额增至四十四亿列弗，存款人增加到五百万人以上，现在，保加利亚每三个人中就有两人有存款，平均存款额为八百八十列弗，相当于每个工人每月平均工资的150％。在今年第一季度的储蓄总额中，农村居民占63％。
    保加利亚党和政府对提高劳动人民的物质福利表现了不倦的关怀。1958年国家用于社会文化设施的费用，比1952年增加了一倍。全国居民都享受到免费的医疗待遇。农业合作社的社员也破天荒第一次可以拿到养老金。
    为了改善人民的居住条件，1945年到1958年间，全国共新建五十二万八千一百三十三幢住宅。在人民政权的年代中，保加利亚在农村中建成的住宅，就等于解放前资产阶级统治时期在七十年中建成的住宅的总和。
    保加利亚人民的医疗、卫生条件也有了很大的改善。目前，全国每七百九十四个居民中就有一名医生，而欧洲资本主义国家平均每九百五十人中才有一个医生。保加利亚几乎所有的农村现在都设有保健所，二百六十三个农村还有现代化的医院。从前农村根本没有产院，而现在除开办七百零四个产院外，还有二百六十八个地区医院设有产科。
    由于人民的物质福利的提高和医疗事业的发展，居民的健康状况也就有了改善。在人民平均寿命方面，保加利亚已超过一系列资本主义国家。1956—1957年，男子平均寿命为六十四岁，女子达到六十八岁。同战前1935—1939年期间比较，男子平均寿命增长了十三岁，女子增长十六岁。保加利亚现在是世界上婴儿死亡率最低的国家之一，婴儿死亡率比解放前降低了三分之二。
