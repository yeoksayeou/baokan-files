Unified Planning to Maximize Land Potential
Xinxing Commune Achieves All-Round Development in Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Side Occupations, and Fishery; Members' Incomes Exceed Previous Years

(By our report) The Xinxing People's Commune in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang, established just one year ago, has achieved an all-round leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fishery by adapting to local conditions and tapping the land's potential for increased production. The material living standards of commune members have generally risen, demonstrating the strong vitality and unparalleled superiority of the people's commune.

The Xinxing People's Commune was formed at the end of August last year through the merger of thirty-seven advanced cooperatives. The commune has thirty-four management districts, one hundred and forty-two production teams, eight thousand two hundred and two households, and forty thousand three hundred and four people. The commune covers a vast area, stretching one hundred and twenty li from east to west and sixty li from north to south. Its territory includes mountains and rivers, with fertile soil suitable for developing diversified operations. Based on these extremely favorable natural conditions, the commune party committee, following the principle of multi-level accounting and adhering to the spirit of taking grain as the key link while developing diversified operations, formulated a unified plan for the all-round development of the rural economy. To increase grain production, while ensuring the completion of the state plan for oil crops and economic crops, the area under high-yield crops was expanded by six hundred and sixty hectares, and the cultivated area was expanded by five hundred hectares. Each management district arranged its crop planting area according to the commune's overall plan. For example, the eastern hilly area mainly cultivated economic crops such as soybeans and sugar beets, supplemented by corn and millet; the western low-lying and watery areas mainly cultivated rice, supplemented by corn and sorghum; and the central plains, with fertile soil and suitable rainfall, mainly cultivated wheat, sorghum, and other crops. Planting crops according to this plan ensured that the land was used to its full potential, allowing crops to grow well. During the advanced cooperative period, each cooperative planted sugar beets according to the proportion of land area. Dasheng Village, where the soil was unsuitable and was more than fifty li away from the railway station, also planted more than thirty hectares of sugar beets, but the yield was only 12,000 jin per hectare, and transportation was also difficult. This year, all of the commune's one thousand four hundred and fifty hectares of sugar beets were planted in fifteen management districts such as Xingfu, Fushan, and "May 1st," where the land was suitable and close to the station. The four management districts of Dasheng and Yonghe, which were not suitable for planting sugar beets, did not plant sugar beets, but planted crops that were suitable for growth. Through land planning, the commune also adjusted interspersed land, eliminated many field paths, land grids, and field ends, thereby making more use of the land. Because the land was contiguous, the zoning was neat, which facilitated mechanized operations, large-scale rotation, and management, and also facilitated rational water use and pest control.

Each management district also developed diversified production according to the commune's unified plan and the characteristics of its own area. The eastern part, with many mountains and forests, such as the Nanliu, "May 1st," and Xinhong management districts, mainly developed diversified operations such as raising livestock and poultry, silkworm rearing, and collecting mountain products; the western part, with low-lying and swampy terrain, such as the Fujia and Dongzuo management districts, mainly developed diversified operations such as fish farming, fishing, and cutting sheep grass; the Xiangyang, Xingfu, and Fushan management districts, where the county seat and railway were located in the central part of the commune, mainly developed diversified operations such as transportation, loading and unloading trains, and weaving. Kangshan Village (now a management district) is backed by mountains and faces a river, with low-lying land prone to flooding and less grain production on the slopes. However, this place with many mountains, water, and grasslands is very suitable for developing animal husbandry. The people of this village had the desire to develop animal husbandry before communization, but lacked funds, and animal husbandry did not develop greatly; after communization, according to the commune's unified plan, the commune helped the village with 30,000 yuan, bought 250 sheep and 57 sows for collective breeding, and established a more than 70-hectare tussah silkworm farm. In this way, this village became a village mainly engaged in animal husbandry. As a result, production has greatly developed, which has not only contributed to the development of the entire commune's economy, but also increased the income of commune members.

Due to the large organizational scale and wide operating range of this commune, and because it adapted to local conditions and tapped the potential of the land, various economic sectors developed in an all-round way. The three thousand three hundred and thirty-eight hectares of wheat planted this year achieved the largest harvest in local history. The yield per unit area increased by 23% compared to the bumper harvest of 1958, and the total output increased by 175%. The autumn crops generally grow luxuriantly, presenting a scene of bumper harvest: soybeans, which account for a quarter of the total cultivated area, are full of pods and fat beans; rice, with many plants and strong stalks, is a deep green, and the four- or five-inch-long panicles have begun to fill; the foot-long corn has almost two ears per stalk; the sorghum, which has all emerged from the ears, has begun to turn pink; and the dense millet has been bent low by the heavy ears. According to multiple surveys and analyses, and compared with previous years, if no major natural disasters occur in the future, the yield per unit area of various crops will increase significantly compared to last year.

In terms of forestry production, the commune planted 27 hectares of various fruit trees, with 21,600 trees. Commune members' families also planted 4,400 fruit trees. Since last year, 100 hectares of afforestation has been carried out on barren hills and poor land, and 222 hectares of forest land has been tended and renewed. This spring, 150,000 trees were planted around the "bare butt villages" that used to have no trees.

Animal husbandry has also developed rapidly from small to large. In addition to the existing four thousand seven hundred and thirty-five draught animals, the commune also had six hundred and thirty newborn foals and four hundred and seventy calves this year. In terms of pig and poultry production, due to the implementation of the principle of combining public and private raising, the number of pigs and poultry has increased rapidly. The commune raised 12,000 pigs, nearly two pigs per household. More than 70,000 chickens and 22,500 ducks and geese were raised, a two-fold increase compared to the same period last year, with an average of 11 poultry per household. Dairy cows, dairy goats, rabbits, bees, and tussah silkworms are all new projects this year. Sideline production such as carting, loading and unloading trains, weaving, collecting mountain products, and fishing is even more active.

Due to the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fishery in the commune, the income of commune members has increased steadily and rapidly. From spring to now, the commune has pre-distributed twice, and some districts and teams have pre-distributed once more. In several pre-distributions, each laborer averaged twenty-five to thirty yuan. A couple working together earns about fifty or sixty yuan. In the upcoming wheat harvest pre-distribution, it is estimated that each laborer can receive about seventy yuan. It is estimated that the total income of all commune members this year will greatly exceed previous years.

August 30th was the first anniversary of the establishment of the Xinxing Commune. To celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the commune, the commune party committee convened a broadcast meeting attended by all commune members on the evening of the 27th. At the meeting, all commune members unanimously and warmly supported the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and were determined to do a good job in current production and strive to complete the targets stipulated in the National Twelve-Year Agricultural Development Program well ahead of schedule. Now, a vigorous new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy has taken shape throughout the commune. As of August 28, more than 10,000 hectares of crops such as corn, sorghum, and soybeans had been ridged in autumn and weeds were removed, and more than 3,500 hectares of weak plots had been upgraded through general processing and tending. At the same time, 191,000 cubic meters of manure fertilizer have been accumulated, and 2,970 hectares of wheat fields (accounting for 90% of the total wheat area) have been plowed. Other various sideline productions are also very active, with an income of more than 55,000 yuan in the past month alone.

    洼地种水稻　岗地栽果木　草地放牛羊
    统一规划发挥土地潜力
    新兴公社农林牧副渔全面发展社员收入超过往年
    本报讯　黑龙江桦川县新兴人民公社建立刚刚一年，由于因地制宜，发挥土地的增产潜力，农林牧副渔获得全面跃进，社员物质生活水平普遍上升，人民公社的强大生命力和无比优越性，在这里已经明显地显示出来。
    新兴人民公社是在去年8月底由三十七个高级社合并建成的。全社有三十四个管理区、一百四十二个生产队，八千二百零二户，四万零三百零四口人。公社地域辽阔，东西长一百二十里，南北宽六十里。境内有山有水，土质肥沃，适于发展多种经营。公社党委根据这一极为有利的自然条件，按着分级核算的原则，本着以粮为纲发展多种经营的精神，统一制定了全面发展农村经济的规划。为了增产粮食，在保证完成国家计划的油料、经济作物播种面积的同时，扩大了高产作物面积六百六十公顷，扩大耕地面积五百公顷。各管理区根据公社的总规划，安排了本区的农作物种植面积。如东部丘陵地带，以种大豆、甜菜等经济作物为主，辅以苞米、谷子；西部低洼多水，以种植水稻为主，辅以苞米、高粱；中部平原，土地肥沃，雨量适宜，以种植小麦、高粱等作物为主。按着这个规划播种农作物，就做到了地尽其力，使农作物生长很好。高级社时期各社按土地面积比例种甜菜。土质不适宜、离火车站五十多里远的大胜村也种三十多公顷甜菜，但每公顷只产一万二千斤，运输也很困难。今年全社的一千四百五十公顷甜菜都种植在土地适宜、离车站近的幸福、福山、“五一”等十五个管理区，不适宜种甜菜的大胜、永和等四个管理区没种甜菜，而种植了适宜生长的作物。全社经过土地规划，还调整了插花地，消灭了许多田间小道、地格子、地头子等，从而更多地利用了土地。由于土地连片，区划整齐，就便于机械作业、大片轮作和管理，也便于合理用水和防治病虫害。
    各管理区还按着公社的统一规划和本区的特点发展多种生产。多山多林的东部，如南柳、“五一”、新宏等管理区，发展家畜家禽、养蚕、采集山产等为主的多种经营；地势低洼、多沼泽的西部，如傅家、东柞等管理区，发展养鱼、捕鱼、打羊草等为主的多种经营；县城和铁路位于全社中部，在这里的向阳、幸福、福山等管理区，发展运输、装卸火车、编织为主的多种经营。康山村（现在是一个管理区）北靠山南靠河，地洼受涝，岗地产粮少，但这种多山多水多草原的地方，非常适宜发展畜牧业。这个村的群众，在公社化以前就有发展畜牧业的愿望，但是缺乏资金，畜牧业没有得到大发展；公社化后，根据全社的统一规划，公社帮助这个村三万元，买了二百五十只羊、五十七口母猪集体饲养，建立了一个七十多公顷的柞蚕场，这样，这个村就变为以经营畜牧业为主的村了。结果生产大大发展了，既对发展全公社的经济有作用，又增加了社员的收入。
    由于这个公社的组织规模大，经营范围广，又因地制宜，发挥了土地的潜力，多种经济全面发展。今年种植的三千三百三十八公顷小麦，获得了当地有史以来最大的丰收。单位面积产量比大丰收的1958年提高23％，总产量提高175％。大秋作物普遍生长繁茂，呈现出一片丰收景象：占总耕地面积四分之一的大豆，豆荚累累，豆粒肥大；株多棵壮的水稻，一片深绿，四五寸长的稻穗开始灌浆；一尺来长的苞米，差不多每株都有二个；已出齐穗的高粱，开始晒粉红米；密密麻麻的谷子，已被沉甸甸的穗子压得低垂下来。据多次调查分析，及同历年比较来看，今后如不发生特大自然灾害，各种作物单位面积产量都将比去年有很大增长。
    在林业生产方面，全社栽植了各种果树二十七公顷，两万一千六百株，社员家庭还栽植了四千四百株果树。从去年以来，在荒山、瘠薄地上造林一百公顷，抚育更新林地二百二十二公顷。今春还在四旁种十五万株树，加上前几年栽的树，现在没有树的“光腚屯”已经不见了。
    畜牧业也从少到多，迅速发展。全社除现有能使役的四千七百三十五头耕畜以外，今年还新生马驹子六百三十匹，牛犊四百七十头。在猪禽生产上，由于贯彻公养与私养并举的方针，猪禽增加得很快，全社养猪一万二千口，每户将近养两口猪。养鸡七万余只，鸭鹅二万二千五百只，比去年同期翻两番，每户平均养十一只家禽。奶牛、奶羊、兔、蜜蜂、柞蚕都是今年新经营的项目。拉脚、装卸火车、编织、采集山货、打鱼等副业生产更为活跃。
    全社由于农林牧副渔全面发展，社员的收入有了稳定而又迅速的增加。从春季到现在，以公社为单位预分过两次，有的还以区、队为单位多预分了一次。几次预分，每个劳动力平均分得二十五元至三十元。一家两口子干活，差不多就收入五六十元。在即将进行的麦收预分中，预计每个劳动力可分到七十元左右。预计全体社员今年的总收入将大大超过往年。
    8月30日，是新兴公社建社一周年。为了庆祝成立公社一周年，27日晚上公社党委召开了全体社员参加的广播大会。会上，全体社员一致热烈拥护党的八届八中全会公报和决议，决心搞好当前生产，争取大大提前完成全国十二年农业发展纲要所规定的指标。现在，一个轰轰烈烈的新的增产节约大高潮，已经在全社范围内形成。到8月28日统计，已有一万零一千多公顷苞米、高粱、大豆等作物放了秋垅、拿完大草，三千五百多公顷薄弱地块经过普遍加工侍弄升了级。与此同时，还积了十九万一千立方米粪肥，有二千九百七十公顷麦田（占麦田总面积90％）已经翻完。其他各种副业生产也很活跃，仅近一个来月，就收入五万五千多元。
