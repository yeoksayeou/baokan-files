Xinhua News Agency, Qinhuangdao, 18th: The National Road-Port Collaboration On-Site Conference recently held in Qinhuangdao called on the broad masses of workers on the national transportation front to actively implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, vigorously promote the spirit of collaboration, learn and promote the road-port collaboration experience of Qinhuangdao and other places, further tap transportation potential, accelerate the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods, and promote the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

The "one-stop" transportation collaboration organized by Qinhuangdao Road and Port tightly connects the thousands of miles of land and water transportation route from Fuxin-Beipiao (coal mine)-Jinzhou-Shanhaiguan-Qinhuangdao-Shanghai into a transportation line through Red Flag trains and scheduled ships, thereby expanding the throughput capacity of stations and ports, and accelerating the turnover of vehicles, ships, and materials. In the second quarter of this year, the average time for a single vehicle operation was shortened to 6.1 hours, a 22% decrease compared to the first quarter; the average number of days each ship was docked was shortened to 1.92 days, a 48% decrease compared to the first quarter. Compared with the first quarter of this year, 180,000 tons more coal were transported due to the shortening of vehicle and ship cycles. In May and September, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau organized 230 Red Flag trains from Fuxin and Xinqiu to Qinhuangdao. Due to the shortening of transfer operation time, the average running time of trains was 9 hours shorter than that of sectional trains, which is equivalent to adding more than 50 trainloads of transportation capacity from Fuxin to Qinhuangdao. The Shanghai Maritime Transport Bureau organized scheduled ships to closely connect with Red Flag trains, implementing direct transshipment between trains and ships, shortening sailing time by 8 to 9 hours, so that seven scheduled ships can transport more than 120,000 tons of coal more per year.

The "one-stop" transportation collaboration not only achieved huge economic benefits, but also satisfied coal mines, sending railway bureaus, maritime transport bureaus, arrival ports, and cargo owners.

The meeting held that the "one-stop" transportation collaboration experience is an expansion and development of the Fuxin Road-Mine and Benxi Road-Factory collaboration experiences, and a major creation in implementing the general line for socialist construction on the transportation front. It has broken through the scope of single collaboration between transportation departments and production departments, opened up a path for comprehensive collaboration between transportation departments, and between transportation departments and production and consignment departments, bringing transportation collaboration to a new stage.

The main experiences of Qinhuangdao in organizing "one-stop" transportation collaboration are four: (1) Strengthen Party leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and vigorously promote the communist spirit of collaboration. During the rectification movement, under the unified leadership of the Qinhuangdao Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the workers of Qinhuangdao Road and Port adopted the method of extensive airing of views, big debates, and criticized departmentalism, learned a profound lesson from the losses caused by mutual wrangling in the past, and thus established the communist idea of "difficulties for oneself, convenience for others." All road and port workers regard shortening the time for vehicles, ships, and goods to stay in port as a common goal. (2) Vigorously launch mass movements and carry out Red Flag competitions. On the basis of unified thinking, road and port workers, focusing on accelerating the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods, carried out various Red Flag competitions. Among the ships in the port, a port-ship collaboration competition based on scheduled agreements was carried out; among the three major shifts of road and port, a "nine comparisons" (comparing ship schedules, train times, loading and unloading numbers, workload, efficiency, safety, unity and collaboration, advanced trains, and advanced voyages) Red Flag competition was carried out; a series of collaborative competitions were also carried out between various units within the road and port, and between different types of work. (3) In light of the characteristics of the transportation department, grasp the key to production and solve the main contradictions. After strengthening collaboration between roads and ports, some problems in technical operations and management systems became more obvious. Therefore, both sides of the road and port carried out a series of important reforms in accordance with the requirements of accelerating the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods, and expanding the throughput capacity of ports and stations. For example, road and port workers worked together to speed up unloading, increased the source of empty cars, and used empty cars to load goods in the same direction, reducing the running of empty cars. In order to solve the problem of insufficient deep-water berths, they created a method of combining deep-water and shallow-water docks, as well as simultaneous piloting of ships entering and leaving the port, which doubled the utilization rate of the dock and halved the time for ships to leave and approach the dock. These reforms have effectively accelerated the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods. (4) Establish appropriate organizational forms, and implement unified thinking, unified planning, unified organizational structure, unified shifts, unified indicators, unified measures, unified task arrangements, unified operation processes, unified use of equipment and forces, unified competition, unified reporting, and unified summary. These "twelve unifications" are the organizational form for consolidating and strengthening port-road collaboration and giving full play to the core role of the "one-stop" transportation hub. It is based on unified thinking, takes unified planning as a common goal, and gives full play to the potential of both road and port through the unification of organizational structure, operation process, and equipment use, to achieve the purpose of accelerating the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods. This is the result of road and port workers giving full play to their subjective initiative and earnestly learning from the Fuxin Road-Mine collaboration experience.

The meeting pointed out that after the implementation of "one-stop" transportation for coal transportation from Fuxin to Shanghai, the total transportation time was shortened by about 14%. If the coastal and Yangtze River shipping of coal in the Bohai Sea were all organized into "one-stop" transportation, 2.6 million tons more coal could be transported with the same transportation capacity. Therefore, promoting the "one-stop" transportation experience on the national transportation front has important practical significance for completing the annual freight task of railways and waterways. The meeting called on workers on the national transportation front to quickly and comprehensively promote this experience, launch a Red Flag competition movement centered on shortening train times and ship schedules, increase the proportion of direct transshipment of vehicles and ships, save labor, improve loading and unloading efficiency, and accelerate the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods.

The meeting was jointly convened by the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, and lasted for seven days. More than 220 representatives from more than 80 units including railway bureaus, port bureaus, shipping bureaus, coal mines such as Fushun and Kailuan, local materials bureaus, import and export companies, the State Planning Commission, and the Transportation Work Department of the CPC Central Committee participated. During the meeting, the representatives also listened to the road-port collaboration experiences introduced by Qingdao, Wuhan and other places, as well as the experiences of Jinzhou Railway Bureau and Shanghai Maritime Transport Bureau in organizing Red Flag trains and advanced ships, and visited the "one-stop" transportation collaboration on-site performance organized by Qinhuangdao Port and Road.

    纵横数千里　路港一线牵
    交通和铁道部推广路港运输大协作经验
    阜新到上海的煤炭运输实行“一条龙”路港协作后全程运输时间缩短14％
    新华社秦皇岛18日电　最近在秦皇岛召开的全国路港协作现场会议，号召全国交通运输战线的广大职工积极贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，大兴协作之风，学习推广秦皇岛等地路港协作经验，进一步挖掘运输潜力，加速车船和货物的周转，促进工农业生产继续跃进。
    秦皇岛路港组织的“一条龙”运输大协作，把阜新—北票（煤矿）—锦州—山海关—秦皇岛—上海这条迢迢千里的水陆运程，通过红旗列车和定班定线船舶，紧密地组成了一条运输线，从而扩大了车站和港口的通过能力，加速了车船物资的周转。今年第二季度，车辆一次作业时间平均缩短到六点一小时，比第一季度缩短22％；每艘船平均停泊天数缩短到一点九二天，比第一季度缩短48％。今年第二季度和第一季度相比，由于车船周期缩短，就多运了十八万吨煤炭。锦州铁路局在5、9两个月，组织了从阜新、新丘开往秦皇岛的红旗列车二百三十列，由于中转作业时间缩短，列车运行时间平均比区段列车缩短九小时，等于阜新至秦皇岛增加了五十多列车的运力。上海海运局组织定班定线船舶同红旗列车紧密衔接，实行车船直接换装，航次时间缩短了八至九小时，七艘定班定线船舶全年因此可以多运煤炭十二万多吨。
    “一条龙”运输协作，不但获得了巨大的经济效果，而且还使煤矿、发送路局、海运局、到达港、货主都十分满意。
    会议认为，“一条龙”运输协作经验，是阜新路矿、本溪路厂协作经验的扩大和发展，是当前运输战线上贯彻社会主义建设总路线的一项重大创造。它已经突破了运输部门与生产部门单一的协作范围，开辟了运输部门之间，运输部门与生产、托运部门之间的全面大协作的途径，使运输协作走上了一个新的阶段。
    秦皇岛组织“一条龙”运输协作的主要经验有四：（一）加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大兴共产主义协作之风。整风运动中，秦皇岛路港职工在中共秦皇岛市委统一领导下，采取大鸣大放大辩论的方法，批判了本位主义思想，记取了过去因为互相扯皮而造成损失的深刻教训，从而树立了“困难归自己，方便给别人”的共产主义思想，全体路港职工都把缩短车船和货物在港停留时间作为共同的奋斗目标。（二）大搞群众运动，开展红旗竞赛。在统一思想的基础上，路港职工以加速车船货物周转为中心，开展了多方面的红旗竞赛。在港船之间，开展了以定班定线协议为依据的港船协作竞赛；在路港三大班之间，开展了“九比”（比船期，比车点，比装卸车数，比作业量，比效率，比安全，比团结协作，比先进列车和先进船次）红旗竞赛；路港内部各单位之间，不同工种之间，也都开展了一系列协作竞赛。（三）针对运输部门的特点，抓住生产关键，解决主要矛盾。路港加强协作以后，技术作业、管理制度方面的一些问题，更明显地暴露出来。于是路港双方就本着加速车船货物周转、扩大港口和车站通过能力的要求，进行了一系列重要改革。如路港职工共同努力加速卸车，增加了空车来源，并且利用空车装同一方向的货物，减少了空车运行。为了解决深水泊位不足的问题，他们创造了深水码头同浅水码头结合应用，以及船舶进出口同时引领的方法，使码头利用率提高了一倍，船舶离靠码头的时间缩短了一半。这些改革，都有力地加速了车船货物的周转。（四）建立恰当的组织形式，实行思想统一，计划统一，组织机构统一，班次统一，指标统一，措施统一，布置任务统一，作业过程统一，设备和力量使用统一，竞赛统一，汇报统一，总结统一。这“十二统一”是巩固加强港路协作，充分发挥“一条龙”运输枢纽核心作用的组织形式。它以思想统一为基础，以计划统一为共同奋斗目标，通过组织机构、作业过程、设备使用统一等，充分发挥路港双方的潜力，达到加速车船货物周转的目的。这是路港职工发挥主观能动性，认真学习阜新路矿协作经验的结果。
    会议指出，阜新到上海的煤炭运输实行“一条龙”运输以后，全程运输时间缩短了约14％。如果北洋沿海和长江沿线水陆联运煤炭都组成“一条龙”运输，就可以以同样的运力多运煤炭二百六十万吨。因此，在全国运输战线推广“一条龙”运输经验，对于完成铁路和水运全年的货运任务有着重要的现实意义。会议要求全国运输战线上的职工，迅速全面推广这一经验，掀起一个以缩短车点、船期为中心的红旗竞赛运动，提高车船直接换装的比重，节省劳力，提高装卸效率，加速车船货物周转。
    这次会议由交通部、铁道部和河北省人民委员会联合召开，共开了七天。参加的有全国各地铁路局，港务局，航运局，抚顺、开滦等煤矿，各地物资局、出进口公司，国家计划委员会，中共中央交通工作部等八十多个单位的代表二百二十多人。会议期间，代表们还听取了青岛、武汉等地介绍的路港协作经验，以及锦州铁路局、上海海运局介绍的组织红旗列车和先进船次的经验，并且参观了秦皇岛港路组织的“一条龙”运输协作现场表演。
