    Recently, during our visit to Gong'an County, Hubei Province, we often asked ourselves: What is the most touching, the most enchanting scenery? Is it those picturesque parks teeming with tourists? Is it those boundless, lush and lovely fields? No, it is not! After our visit to Gong'an County, which was hit by a severe drought, we deeply felt that only the great scenes of people who dare to declare war on Heaven, demanding grain, cotton… from nature, are the most moving and enchanting!
    One morning in August, we set off from the County Committee, crossed a dyke, and arrived at the Changjiang Commune. That day, the sun was like a fiery umbrella hanging high in the sky, and the flourishing crops – sturdy rice, tall cotton… stood proudly in the fields. In the distance, the rhythmic sound of rice threshing buckets came from time to time, and people were busy harvesting mid-season rice; nearby, groups of male and female commune members were busy with pest control, weeding, and topdressing… ceaselessly. If it weren't for the anti-drought slogans plastered everywhere, it would be hard to believe that this was a place that hadn't seen rain for forty or fifty days. Because, under normal circumstances, crops should have looked terrible after dozens of days of severe drought! However, here, everything before our eyes was a different scene!
    We came to the Red Flag Team of the Jingjiang Production Brigade. A dozen male and female commune members, carrying sprayers on their backs, like soldiers going out to battle, were working vigorously in a cotton field more than half a person tall. Leading the way was a middle-aged man around forty years old, named Wang Caifu, born a hired laborer, now the team's technical leader. Today, he was leading the commune members to start the ninth pest control in this field. Comrade Xiao Tan from the County Committee Office, who accompanied us on the visit, quietly told us: "This is Wang Jiji (Wang the Active)?" We asked why he was called Wang Jiji. It turned out to be this: In late July, the drought became more and more serious. More than 120 mu of the team's 380 mu of cotton were losing leaves and bolls, and old Wang was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. He thought: No matter what, we can't let the cotton suffer. So, during the day, he led the commune members to the field for pest control; at night, he took the lead in operating water wheels to irrigate the fields. After several consecutive days and nights of "upper spraying and lower irrigation, lower irrigation and upper control," he indeed saved those 120 mu of cotton fields. The storyteller told us that in those days, old Wang seemed to have taken root in the fields, working day and night, and he even couldn't bother to ask about his two young sons who were sick for a few days. It was only after the urging of the Party branch secretary that he took them to the clinic in the street. But as soon as he sent the children home, he threw the medicine into his wife's arms and rushed back to the field. The nickname "Wang Jiji" spread among the people in this way. Now, we are simply fascinated by the shiny cotton field in front of us. Old Wang stopped his work and said, "Look, people are still more ruthless than Heaven!" As he spoke, he bent down and counted two cotton plants, each with thirteen or fourteen egg-sized bolls. He wiped the sweat from his face and said with full confidence, "Don't think there are many bolls in the early stage, we will make the autumn bolls surpass the early bolls!" At this time, several young men beside Old Wang chimed in and said: We guarantee we'll do what we say. Then everyone laughed.
    Laughter vibrated in the fields…. This laughter was clearly a challenge to nature, a contempt for nature!
    After leaving the Red Flag Team, Xiao Tan specially led us to the Seventh Team of the Jinji Production Brigade. This team was the most severely affected by the drought in the entire commune. Therefore, on the way, we were muttering: The crops there must be withered! But, completely contrary to our expectations. Look! Large tracts of cotton, like a green ocean, stretch straight to the horizon, the fields are moist, and there is still a smell of earth in the air. What's going on? Gong Zuhua, the Party branch secretary of the team, smiled gently and said, "It's really unfortunate, you would have seen it if you had come a few days earlier!" Then, he told us a story like this:
    This team planted 254 mu of cotton this year. In late July, when it was flowering and bolling, the heavens turned against them, with scorching sun and strong southerly winds all day long, lasting for twenty or thirty days. Since some day, red spiders spread all at once, and the shiny cotton turned from green to yellow, from yellow to red, from red to withered…, and a gust of wind could blow a pile to the ground. In just a few days, 224 mu of the team's 254 mu of cotton were completely bare. Who wouldn't be heartbroken to see the crops they planted with their own hands turn out like this in just a few days? However, judging from the situation at the time, it was impossible to save it with the strength of this team alone. Could they just let the drought demon swallow it up like this? No! Therefore, at the call of the Party branch, the commune members of each team didn't say a word, sending people and fertilizer. In those unforgettable days, on the road we just walked, the people delivering manure were constantly coming and going. Xu Huanbi and Gong Biyu, fifty-year-old grandmothers from the Third Team, moved their small feet and carried a large bucket of manure in the crowd; an old man named Zhu Yixin from the Ninth Team, who hadn't worked for several years, heard that the cotton in the Seventh Team had been damaged, and hurriedly brought a load of manure from his home and scattered it in the field with his own hands. In order to quickly "revive" the cotton, the Party branch organized a shock team composed of seventy or eighty laborers supported by various teams, eating and sleeping in the fields, working day and night to operate water wheels to irrigate the fields, controlling pests, weeding, and hoeing, and topdressing…. After seven or eight days and nights of such a great battle, the cotton, which had been bare, returned from the brink of death and regained its life. On the day of our visit, the cotton here had green branches and leaves, and the bolls were piled up, which was lovely. The commune members who were busy weeding and controlling pests in the cotton fields said to us: "The strength of the people's commune is really great, and the dead crops have been saved!"
    We have been moved by this story all along. Just think, why is it that the same people, who in the past would either leave or flee when they encountered disasters that were much lighter than this, are now boldly changing the fate of the crops in such a severe drought! What a huge change this is!
    One day, we visited the Shuanghu Production Brigade of the Yuhu Commune in the rice-producing area. The commune members were "yongcao" (i.e., trampling the roots with their feet) and topdressing in the watery double-cropping late rice fields. Yang Shiyun, the Party Committee Secretary of the commune who accompanied us on the visit, said to us: "In the past, this area didn't weed or topdress the double-cropping late rice. This year, in order to surpass the early rice, everyone has changed their old habits." We were really attracted by the green rice fields in front of us, and we couldn't help but say, "Good seedlings, good seedlings." Old Yang bent down and counted, one plant had already tillered fourteen roots, and then smiled and said, "This is not even a first-class seedling!" We calculated that it had only been more than twenty days from transplanting to now, and the late rice had grown to a foot tall and tillered to seal the rows, which is rare. At this time, we suddenly remembered a story we heard when we first arrived: In early August, the General Branch Committee of the Yuhu Management District of the Communist Party of China commended the Third Team of the You'ai Production Brigade at a small team leaders' meeting. The 90 mu of late rice in this team had tillered eighteen to twenty roots per plant. At that time, only Ren Xueyun, the captain of the Fifth Team of the Wuxing Production Brigade, was unconvinced and kept muttering in his heart: "Our team's 40 mu of late rice has been weeded twice and topdressed twice, and there are still more than ten mu of backward seedlings!" After the meeting, this impatient person didn't even eat and hurried to the Third Team of the You'ai Production Brigade, five or six li away. After taking a look, it was indeed good, good everywhere. Old Ren returned to the team and immediately discussed with the team committee, and then convened a commune member meeting to specially arrange the manpower to rush to topdress and weed, and finally made the more than ten mu of backward seedlings catch up with the first-class seedlings. You see, people are chasing me like this, I am chasing you, adding effort, adding measures, how can the rice not grow well!
    During our visit to Gong'an County, the sentence we heard the most was "experimental fields move house." At first, we didn't quite understand the full meaning of this sentence. Later, after inquiring, it turned out to be this: In order to overcome the drought and seize a good harvest, many cadres in this county chose the experimental fields in the places with the heaviest drought and the greatest difficulties, in order to influence and lead the broad masses. This is what people often say is the experimental field moving "house." Xiong Changyu, the First Secretary of the Yonghe Commune Party Committee, originally had his experimental field in the Xinyun Production Brigade in the plain area, where the water source was good. After the drought lasted for more than twenty days, he suddenly moved the experimental field to the Eighth Team of the Baiyun Production Brigade. That was a hilly area, with high terrain and difficult water source. After Old Xiong put up the sign of the experimental field, in order to rescue the rice seedlings that were about to dry out, after discussing with the old farmers, he used 19 water wheels to turn over nine ponds and weirs from the foot of the mountain, and forcibly turned the water under the mountain to the hill, and as a result, he rescued the highest and worst-watered rice field. In this way, the experimental fields of the cadres in the entire commune moved "house" one after another. The working style of the cadres being so bold, daring, and hard-working further encouraged the broad masses of commune members, and especially educated those who initially lacked confidence in overcoming natural disasters. There is also such a thing here: Dai Jiafan of the Red Flag Team of the Jingjiang Production Brigade of the Changjiang Commune had 11 mu of cotton, which was very short due to the long drought, and several mu of them had already "collapsed." At that time, many commune members determined that this field was hopeless. Zhang Shuanbi, the captain of this small team, a female Communist Party member, and Tan Zaide, a Party member, disagreed with everyone's view, but they couldn't convince others. So, they connected with a dozen female commune members and began to carry water to irrigate the fields. Some commune members saw it and kindly advised them: "As the saying goes, 'an inch of seedlings is not afraid of a foot of water, but a foot of seedlings is afraid of an inch of water', you can't water it!" They thought: If people don't drink water, they will be thirsty, can crops be different? They still carried and watered every day. In two days, all the water was moistened once. Then, they controlled pests, cultivated in the middle, weeded, topdressed…, in this way, this cotton, which was considered hopeless, changed every day, and as a result, the entire team quickly launched an anti-drought movement and set off a climax of cotton field cultivation and management.

    敢于向天宣战的人
    本报记者  田庄  胡烈斌
    最近，我们在访问湖北省公安县的日子里，常常问起自己：什么是最动人、最迷人的景色？是那些景致如画、游人如织的公园吗？是那些一望无际、葱绿可爱的田野吗？不，不是！当我们访问了遭到大旱袭击的公安县以后，深深地感到：只有敢于向天宣战的人，跟大自然索取粮食、棉花……的伟大情景，才是最动人、最迷人的！
    8月的一天上午，我们从县委会出发，翻过一道堤防，来到了长江公社。这天，太阳像把火伞高挂天空，茂盛的庄稼——茁壮的稻禾，高大的棉花……傲然地?立在田野里。远处，不时传来扮禾桶的有节奏的响声，人们正在忙碌地收打中稻；近处，一群群的男女社员，有的在治虫，有的在除草，有的在追肥……忙个不停。要不是到处贴着抗旱的标语，简直令人不能相信这里竟是四、五十天没下过雨的地方。因为，在通常的情况下，大旱几十天，庄稼早该不像样子啦！但是，在这里，我们眼前的一切却是另一番景色！
    我们来到了荆江生产队的红旗小队。十几个男女社员身背喷雾器，像出征的战士一样，雄赳赳、气昂昂，正在一片大半人高的棉花地里劳动着。打头的是一个四十上下的中年人，这人叫王财富，长工出身，现在是队里的技术队长。今天，是他领着社员在这片田里开始第九次的治虫了。陪同我们访问的县委办公室的小谭，轻轻地告诉我们：“这就是王积极啊？”此人为什么叫王积极，一问原来是这么回事：7月下旬，干旱越来越严重了。全队三百八十多亩棉花就有一百二十多亩脱叶掉铃，老王急得像热锅里的蚂蚁。心想：不管咋样，也不能叫棉花受屈。于是，白天，他领着社员下地治虫；夜晚，他又带头车水灌田，连续几天几夜的“上打下灌、下灌上治”，果然把这一百二十多亩棉田救下来啦。讲故事的人告诉我们：在那些日子里，老王呀，就好像脚上生了根似地，没日没夜地长在田里，甚至他的两个小儿子病了几天，他也顾不上问一下，还是在支部书记的催促下，才带他们到街上门诊所看了看。但是，把孩子刚送回家，他把药往妻子怀里一丢，拔腿又到田里去了。“王积极”这个绰号便这样在人们中间叫开了。现在，我们简直被眼前这片油光水滑的棉花迷住了。老王这时停下手里的活儿，说：“看，人还是比天狠哪！”说着，弯下腰连数了两株棉花，每株都有十三、四个鸡蛋大的伏桃。他用手抹去脸上的汗，信心十足地说：“别看伏桃多，我们还要叫秋桃超伏桃哩！”这时，老王身旁的几个小伙子也插嘴说：保证说到做到。接着，大家都笑起来了。
    笑声在田野里震荡着……。这笑声分明是向大自然的挑战，对大自然的藐视啊！
    离开红旗小队以后，小谭特地又把我们引到金积生产队的第七小队。这个队是全公社旱情最重的地方。所以，在路上我们心里就这么嘀咕着：那里的庄稼怕要干枯了吧！但是，完全出于我们的意料。你看吧！大片大片的棉花，像绿色的海洋直伸向天边，田里是湿润润的，空气里还散发着一股泥土味哩。这是怎么回事呢？队的支部书记龚祖华轻轻地笑了笑，说：“真不巧，你们早来几天就看见啦！”接着，他给我们讲了一段这样的故事：
    这个小队今年种植了二百五十四亩棉花。7月下旬，正是开花结铃的时候，老天偏偏跟他们作对，成天烈日暴晒，南风猛吹，整整持续了二、三十天。不知从哪天起，红蜘蛛又一下蔓延开啦，油光光的棉花由绿而黄，由黄而红，由红而枯……，一阵风能吹落一地，只几天功夫，全队二百五十四亩棉花，就有二百二十四亩落个精光。庄稼人看到自己一手种的庄稼，几天变成了这样子，谁不痛心？但是，从当时的情况看，单凭这个小队的力量怎么也挽救不了。难道就叫旱魔这样吞掉了吗？不能！因此，支部一声号召，各个小队的社员没说二话，出人的出人，送肥的送肥，在那些难忘的日子里，就在我们刚才走过的那条路上，送粪的成天络绎不绝。第三小队的五十多岁的婆婆徐欢?和龚?玉，挪动着小脚，也抬着一大桶粪夹在人群中间；第九小队有个叫朱一新的老汉，已经几年没出工了，听到七小队的棉花遭了害，忙把自己家里的大粪送来了一担，并且亲手撒到田里。为了叫棉花迅速“起死回生”，支部把各小队支援的七、八十个劳动力，组成了一支突击队，吃、睡都在田间，不分日夜地车水灌田，治虫锄草，中耕追肥……这样大战了七、八个昼夜，原先已经光秃秃的棉花，这才从死亡的边缘上返回过来，重新获得了生命。我们访问的那天，这里的棉花青枝绿叶，花铃累累，逗人喜爱。正忙着给棉花锄草、治虫的社员们对我们说：“人民公社的力量实在大，死了的庄稼又被救活了！”
    我们一直被这个故事激动着。请想想看，还是那些人，为什么过去那怕碰到比这轻得多的灾害，不是走的走，就是逃的逃。而现在，在如此严重干旱的情况下，他们却胆大包天地改变着庄稼的命运！这是多么巨大的变化啊！
    有一天，我们到水稻产区的玉湖公社的双湖生产队访问，社员们正在水汪汪的双季晚稻田里“踊草”（即用脚踩蔸）、追肥，陪同我们访问的公社党委书记杨世云对我们说：“这里过去对双季晚稻不薅草，不追肥，今年为了超早稻，大家把老习惯都改变了。”我们真被眼前一块又一块的青乌乌的稻田吸引住了，有时竟情不自禁地说：“好禾苗，好禾苗。”老杨弯下腰数了一数，一蔸已分蘖十四根，然后笑着说：“这还划不上一类苗呢！”我们屈指一算，从插秧到现在只不过二十多天，而晚稻已长有尺把高，发蔸封行，这已不多见啦。这时，我们突然想起刚来时听到的一个故事：8月上旬，中共玉湖管理区总支委员会在一次小队长的会议上，表扬了友爱生产队第三小队。这个小队九十亩晚稻，蔸蔸都已分蘖十八到二十根。当时，只有五星生产队第五小队的队长任学云不服气，心里老是嘀咕着：“我们队里四十亩晚稻连薅了两遍草，追了两遍肥，还有十来亩的落后苗哩！”散会以后，这个急性子人连饭也不吃，便三步并两步地赶到五、六里路外的友爱生产队第三小队。一看，确是块块好，蔸蔸好。老任折回队里，马上找队委商量，接着又召开社员大会，专门安排了力量，突击追肥薅草，终于使十几亩落后苗赶上了一类苗。你看，人们就是这样地你追我，我赶你，加干劲，加措施，稻禾怎能长不好呢！
    在访问公安县的日子里，我们听得最多的一句话要算“试验田搬家”了。开头，我们还不大了解这句话的全部意思，后来一打听，原来是这么回事：为了战胜干旱夺取丰收，这个县的许多干部把试验田选在干旱最重、困难最大的地方，以影响带动广大群众。这就是人们常说的试验田搬“家”了。中共永和公社党委第一书记熊昌钰，原来试验田在平原地区的新云生产队，水源好；干旱持续了二十多天以后，他突然把试验田搬到白云生产队的第八小队。那里是个山岗地带，地势高，水源困难。老熊把试验田的牌子插上以后，为了抢救这里快要干死的禾苗，同老农商量以后，就用十九部水车，从山脚下翻过九口塘堰，硬把山下的水翻上了山岗，结果把这块地势最高、水源最差的稻田抢救下了。这样一来，全公社的干部的试验田都纷纷搬开“家”了。干部们这样敢想敢做、实干苦干的工作作风，更加鼓舞了广大社员，特别是对那些开始对战胜自然灾害信心不足的人教育更大。这里还有这样一件事：长江公社荆江生产队红旗小队的戴家?有十一亩棉花，因久旱长得很矮，其中有几亩已经“垮秆”。当时，不少社员断定这块田无救了。这个小队的队长、女共产党员张栓?和党员谭在德却跟大家的看法不一样，可是他们又说服不了人家，于是，便串连了十几个妇女社员，开始挑水灌田。有的社员看见了，好心地劝他们说：“俗语说‘寸苗不怕尺水，尺苗却怕寸水’，浇不得呀！”她们想：人不喝水还渴得慌呢，庄稼能两样？她们还是每天挑呀浇呀，两天功夫，全部润了一次水。接着，她们就治虫、中耕、锄草、追肥……，就是这样，这块被人认为无救的棉花，一天变一个样，结果全队很快地开展了抗旱运动，并掀起了棉田培育管理的高潮。
