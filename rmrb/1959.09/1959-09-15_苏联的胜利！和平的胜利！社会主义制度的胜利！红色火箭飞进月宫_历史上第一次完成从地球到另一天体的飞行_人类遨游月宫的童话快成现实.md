Soviet Victory! Victory for Peace! Victory for the Socialist System!
Red Rocket Flies into the Lunar Palace
Historically First Flight from Earth to Another Celestial Body Completed. The Fairy Tale of Humans Exploring the Lunar Palace is About to Become Reality

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket reached the surface of the moon on September 14th. TASS released a communique, the full text of which is as follows:

Today (September 14th) at 00:02:24 Moscow time, the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket reached the surface of the moon.

For the first time in history, a flight from Earth to another celestial body has been completed. To mark this remarkable event, a marker bearing the Soviet national emblem and the inscription "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. September 1959" was sent to the surface of the moon.

Structural measures were taken to ensure that this marker remained intact upon impact with the moon.

The scientific measurement plan has been completed.

The radio equipment installed on the container with scientific and measuring instruments stopped working upon impact with the moon.

The arrival of the Soviet cosmic rocket on the moon is an outstanding achievement in science and technology. It opens a new chapter in the exploration of cosmic space.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket reached the moon at 00:02:24 Moscow time today, according to the original plan. This fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's outstanding achievements in cosmic flight research and rocket technology.

As early as September 12th, when the communique on the launch of the cosmic rocket was released, TASS pointed out that the cosmic rocket was expected to reach the moon at 00:05 Moscow time on September 14th.

As the cosmic rocket advanced towards the moon, ground measurements and calculations were continuously carried out based on its actual operation. Any changes in any aspect could affect the rocket's operation. Therefore, on September 12th, before the rocket reached the moon, TASS science reporters predicted here that it would touch the surface of the moon, and it was also possible that it would become a satellite of the moon, or continue to advance and become a new artificial planet.

The final facts prove that the cosmic rocket achieved the first possibility and collided with the moon. This degree of precision is extremely astonishing.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Moscow Dispatch: According to a TASS report from Moscow on September 13th: At 16:00 Moscow time on September 13th, the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket continued its flight towards the moon. Ground control stations continued to receive scientific information from the rocket.

Since the rocket reappeared within the observation range of the Soviet observation stations, a complete set of automatic measuring instruments has continued to observe the rocket's flight and measure the parameters of its actual orbit. The results of processing the measurement data show that the rocket is moving towards the moon along an orbit close to the original calculation. The adjustment calculation center is now finalizing the parameters of the rocket's flight orbit.

The rocket's orbit from Earth to the Moon can be divided into two segments. In the first segment (from the start of the launch to about 66,000 kilometers from the moon), the Earth's gravity plays a major role. At this time, the rocket's speed gradually decreases as it moves further and further away from the ground, from an initial speed of more than 11.2 kilometers per second to 2.31 kilometers per second. In the second segment, the Moon's gravity plays a major role. At this time, as it approaches the Moon, the rocket's speed gradually increases, and at 1,000 kilometers from the lunar surface, the speed will reach 2.97 kilometers per second, and the speed at contact with the Moon will be 3.3 kilometers per second. At 16:40 Moscow time, the rocket will enter the Moon's gravitational range.

At 18:00 Moscow time, the rocket will be 322,000 kilometers from Earth, and its position above the ground will be 12.5 degrees south latitude and 95.9 degrees east longitude. At that time, the rocket will be about 54,000 kilometers from the moon.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Moscow Dispatch: Reporters Dai Feng and Cui Yongchang reported: On the evening of September 13th, a bright moon hung high above the Moscow River. This was an unusual night, and an atmosphere of excitement and pride filled the capital of the Soviet state.

Crowds gathered at the Moscow Planetarium, where nineteen telescopes were pointed in the direction of the moon, and people were observing the lunar surface through the telescopes. A powerful radio in the planetarium was receiving signals from the cosmic rocket.

With only forty minutes left until the cosmic rocket reached the moon, the director of the planetarium, Bauzekin, accompanied us to a model of the lunar surface layer. He pointed to a small depression on the map with a white arrow and said that the cosmic rocket would collide with the moon here. This place is within the "Sea of Tranquility", "Sea of Serenity" and "Sea of Vapors" areas. He said that we call the darker areas of the lunar surface "seas", but they are not real seas, but rather large lunar plains, because the surface is darker, it is easier to observe when the rocket arrives, so the cosmic rocket chose to land here.

At 00:02:24 on September 14th, the signal from the cosmic rocket suddenly stopped, and the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket successfully reached the moon. (Attached picture)

    红色火箭飞进月宫
    历史上第一次完成从地球到另一天体的飞行  人类遨游月宫的童话快成现实
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联第二个宇宙火箭14日到达了月球表面。塔斯社发表了公报，全文如下：
    今天（9月14日）莫斯科时间零时零二分二十四秒，苏联第二个宇宙火箭到达了月球表面。
    历史上第一次完成了从地球到另一个天体上的飞行。为了给这个卓越的事件留下标志，把带有苏联国徽和“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟。1959年9月”字样的标记送到了月球的表面。
    为了保证在同月球相碰时，这个标记能够保持完整，曾经采取了一些结构上的措施。
    科学测量计划已经完成。
    安装在带有科学和测量仪器的容器上的无线电装置，在同月球相碰时已经停止工作。
    苏联宇宙火箭到达月球是科学和技术的杰出成就。在考察宇宙空间方面揭开了新的一页。
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联第二个宇宙火箭已在今天莫斯科时间零时零二分二十四秒，按照原订计划到达了月球。这充分证明了苏联在宇宙飞行的研究和火箭技术方面的卓越成就。
    早在9月12日发布关于发射宇宙火箭公报的时候，塔斯社就指出，预计宇宙火箭将在9月14日莫斯科时间零时零五分到达月球。
    当宇宙火箭在向月球前进的时候，地面上不断继续按照它的实际运行情况，进行测量计算。如果各方面的情况稍有变动，都可能对火箭运行产生影响。因此，塔斯社科学记者在火箭到达月球以前，就曾在12日在这里预测，它将接触月球的表面，同时也有可能成为月球的卫星，或者继续前进成为新的人造行星。
    最后的事实证明，宇宙火箭实现了第一个可能，同月球相碰了。这种精确程度是极其惊人的。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：9月13日莫斯科时间十六时，苏联第二个宇宙火箭继续朝月球飞行。地面遥控站继续从火箭上收到科学情报。
    自从火箭重新在苏联各观测站的观测区内出现以后，一整套自动测量仪器又继续不断地对火箭的飞行进行观测，并测量其实际轨道的参数。整理测量数据的结果表明，火箭沿着接近原计算的轨道向月球运行。现在，调整计算中心正在最后确定火箭飞行轨道的参数。
    火箭从地球飞向月球的轨道可以分为两段。在第一段（从运行开始到离月球约六万六千公里处）运行时，主要的是地球引力起作用。这时，火箭的速度随着离开地面愈来愈远而逐渐减小，从最初每秒十一点二公里以上减少到每秒二点三一公里。在第二段运行时，主要是月球的引力起作用。这时，随着和月球的接近，火箭的速度逐渐增加，而在离月球表面一千公里时，速度将达到每秒二点九七公里，与月球相接触时，速度将为每秒三点三公里。莫斯科时间十六时四十分，火箭将进入月球引力范围。
    莫斯科时间十八时，火箭离地球将为三十二万二千公里，它在地面上空的位置将为南纬十二点五度，东经九十五点九度。那时火箭离月球约有五万四千公里。
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　记者戴枫、崔永昌报道：9月13日的晚上，一轮明月高挂在莫斯科河上空。这是一个不平常的夜晚，一种兴奋和骄傲的气氛充满了苏维埃国家的首都。
    在莫斯科天文馆里聚集了广大的人群，这里有十九架天文望远镜对准了月球的方向，人们从望远镜里注视着月球表面。在天文馆里有一架强力收音机正在收听着来自宇宙火箭的讯号。
    离宇宙火箭到达月球的时间只剩四十多分钟了，天文馆馆长鲍泽金陪着我们走到一个月球表面层模型图那里。他指着图上插着一个白色箭头的小洼地说，宇宙火箭将要在这儿和月球相碰。这个地方在“澄海”、“静海”和“汽海”地区内。他说，我们把月球表面较暗的区域称为“海”，实际上并不是真正的海，而是面积较大的月平地，因为表面较暗，火箭到达时易于观察，所以宇宙火箭选择在这里降落。
    14日零时2分24秒，无线电中宇宙火箭的讯号突然停止，苏联第二个宇宙火箭胜利地到达了月球。（附图片）
