	School Opens Today
		Chen Si
	Today, the new school year begins.
	Today, all primary schools welcome new students. The classrooms are bright and clean, the sports fields are brand new. The smell of paint on the desks and wave wood has not completely dissipated, waiting for the laughter of the children.
	Today, the primary schools of the People's Communes welcome another group of children amidst the fight against drought and the joy of harvest. Today, bright red scarves flash on the streets of Lhasa, reflecting and competing with the yellow tiles of the Jokhang and Ramoche Temples. Today, millions more children who have just left the care of kindergarten teachers proudly and curiously step into the gates of elementary school. Our secondary and higher education institutions are also opening one after another, welcoming batch after batch of new students.
	Our Party and country are meticulous in the education and cultivation of the new generation. In the 1959 national budget, social, cultural, and educational expenditures accounted for 11% of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 32% over the previous year. In 1952, we had more than 51 million primary school students, which increased to 86 million last year.
	What immerses us in infinite happiness is not just the numbers, though they shine so brightly. Don't people love to compare children to "flowers of the motherland"? This is not an exaggeration at all. Although, because our country's material production base is not yet rich enough, we have not been able to prepare more things for the children as our advanced brother countries have. However, they are enjoying a happiness that their elders have never experienced.
	At times like these, one cannot help but think of the West.
	Just a few days ago, there was a news item: in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the United States, a group of racists caused trouble again because two public schools accepted five black children. They shouted "Against black and white co-education." The governor of Arkansas also cheered for these guys, saying: "I am always with you." The inhuman treatment suffered by black children in the United States, is it only in Little Rock? In the United States, who are the only children deprived of the right to attend school? According to statistics, only 77% of school-age children in the United States can enter school.
	What if you go to school? Aren't American parents racking their brains over the "adaptation to life" theory? According to that theory, which is quite popular in the United States, education is not for the noble purpose of cultivating new people, but only for "adapting to life." As for seeking knowledge, that is a secondary task. Therefore, in order to adapt to capitalist life, parents choose courses for their children at will, just like buying stocks and doing business. At the end of the school year, all students, regardless of their grades, are 100% promoted, supposedly to avoid children's "disappointment." The "Chicago Sun-Times" published a letter from a reader, which said: "Johnny should go to high school, but he still can't read, write, or do arithmetic properly. ... The only product of our education system is: football players, boys and girls who spend time at night, and worthless diplomas." The letter was signed "Angry Parent."
	This parent's anger is understandable. It is not surprising that such an education system appears under a social system like that in the United States. In a country where education expenses account for only 4% of the national budget, and where the purpose of education is only to cultivate a group of tools for monopoly capital groups, how can one expect it to be decent?
	There is an Eastern proverb: "Tell me how you treat your children, and I will know what you are thinking." Can't the truth of this sentence also be proved from the matter of children entering school?

    今天开学
          陈思
    今天，新的学年开始了。
    今天，所有的小学迎接新的学生，教室里，窗明几净，运动场上，焕然一新，课桌和浪木的油漆气味还没有完全散尽，就等待着孩子们的欢笑声了。
    今天，人民公社的小学校在抗旱的战斗和丰收的欢乐中迎来又一批孩子。今天，在拉萨的街头闪动着鲜艳的红领巾，同大小昭寺的黄瓦相映争辉。今天，又是几百万刚离开幼儿园阿姨的孩子们，骄傲而又好奇地跨进小学校大门。我们的中等和高等学校，也正在陆陆续续开学，迎接一批一批的新学生。
    我们的党和国家对新生一代的教育和培养是无微不至的。在1959年的国家预算里，社会文教费占预算支出总数的11％，比上年又增长32％。在1952年，我们有五千一百多万小学生，到了去年，就增加到八千六百万了。
    使我们沉浸在无限的幸福感中的，还不只是由于数字，它们是那样金光闪闪。人们不是爱把孩子们比作“祖国的花朵”吗？这是一点也不过份的。虽然，由于我们国家的物质生产基础还不够丰富，我们还没有能像我们的先进的兄弟国家那样，为孩子们准备下更多的东西。但是，他们正享受着他们的长辈们从没经历过的幸福。
    在这种时候，总是使人不禁想到西方。
    就在几天以前，报上还有这么一条新闻：在美国阿肯色州小石城，由于两所公立学校收容了五个黑人孩子入学，一帮种族主义者又闹了事，叫嚷“反对黑白人合校”。阿肯色州州长也为这批家伙喝采，说：“我始终同你们在一起。”美国的黑孩子所受到的非人的遭遇，又岂仅是小石城一地？在美国，被剥夺了入学的权利的，又岂仅是黑人的孩子？据统计，美国的学龄儿童能入学校的，只有77％。
    入了学校又怎么办？美国的家长们，不正在为“适应生活”论大伤其脑筋么？按照那个在美国相当流行的理论，教育不是为了高尚的培养新人的目的，只是为了“适应生活”。至于求知识，那更是次要的任务。于是，为了适应资本主义的生活，家长们就随意为孩子们选择课程，就像他买股票、做买卖一样。到了学年结束，全体学生不问成绩好坏，百分之一百都升级，据说这样做为的是不使儿童“希望破灭”。“芝加哥太阳时报”发表过一封读者来信，信里说：“约翰尼该进高等学校了，但是他直到现在还不会像样子地读书、写字和作算术题。……我们教育制度的唯一产品，就是：足球员、在晚上消磨时间的男孩和女孩，以及毫无价值的文凭。”信后署名是“愤怒的家长”。
    这位家长的愤怒，是可以理解的。在美国那样的社会制度下出现那样的教育制度，也是不足为怪的。在教育费用只占国家预算的4％的国家里，在教育的目的只是培养一批垄断资本集团的工具的国家里，怎么可能指望它像样一些呢？
    东方有一句谚语；“告诉我你怎样对待你的孩子，我就知道你正在想些什么。”从儿童入学这一件事上，不是也可以证明这句话的真理吗？
