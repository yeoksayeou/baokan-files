This National Games is an unprecedentedly large gathering of heroes in the history of Chinese sports. The athletes participating in the competition were selected from tens of millions of people from the grassroots level. Among them are world record holders, creators of the latest world achievements, and world champions, totaling 640 athletes of master level and 2,714 first-class athletes. Eighteen delegations have reached the full quota (400 people). Even remote areas of the motherland such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet have sent athletes.
