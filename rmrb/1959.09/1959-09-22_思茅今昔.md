Simao: Then and Now
By Our Reporter Ye Zijian

	This is the Simao "malaria zone" people used to talk about.
	Before my eyes, the plains and valleys of Simao County: the early rice is being harvested, the late rice has just been planted, and the middle rice is already bowing its head. In the dry land by the mountains, ripe pineapples exude a fragrant aroma, heavy bunches of bananas droop from the large leaves, and the endless sugarcane grows taller than people. Those who are harvesting the rice swiftly thresh the newly cut ears of rice in "threshing basins," and the fields are filled with the lively sound of threshing. At night, Simao City is brightly lit, sparks fly in the steel mill, motors roar in the machinery factory, and the sparks from the chimneys quickly disappear into the dark night sky. Simao, like a pearl in the Wuliang Mountains, is lovable.
	In the face of this brand-new scene, I cannot help but recall the situation in Simao City not long after our army arrived one winter.
	At that time, I followed a mule team, trekking through thousands of mountains and valleys for several days before reaching Simao. The weeds in the fields swayed in the wind, and everywhere there were iron caltrops and cacti. On a barren dam, there was a wrecked airplane. When we went to look at the fuselage, several emaciated wild dogs suddenly jumped out of the cabin. Not far ahead, a dead horse lay by the post road, and several vultures pecking at the dead horse were startled and flew low. Simao City, the dilapidated city gate could no longer be closed. At night, there were no lights in the city, and no pedestrians on the streets.
	That night, several comrades and I talked about the severe malaria epidemic in this Simao "malaria zone." Not far away, we heard the mournful cries of wild animals. I could not sleep for a long time because of the desolate scene of this malaria-stricken city. But, in just a few years, when I came to Simao for the second time, it had become unrecognizable. That night, I stayed in the newly built Simao Hotel, and across the street, the cinema was showing "And Quiet Flows the Don." The laughter of the audience caused by the film also kept me awake for a long time.
	The next day, comrades from the county committee led me to visit the Dongfeng People's Commune. The deputy director of the commune, Ma Wenliang, said: "If you want to understand the changes in Simao County, there is no one more suitable than the old commune member Zhang Chongde." Near a group of milky white buildings, in a courtyard, Zhang Chongde was playing with his fat son. As soon as he saw me, he said: "Fortunately, we have the Party, or I would not be alive today." Then he said:
	“You may not know that there used to be malaria here every year, and many people felt uncomfortable in the morning and died by night. Even the Kuomintang county magistrate in Simao City fled to the high mountains."
	"You may not believe it," Lao Zhang said with a smile as he looked at me, "At that time, leopards gave birth in the county yamen, and tigers bit cattle and horses on the streets. I lived in Sanjia Village, only two miles from the city. More than thirty households all died of malaria. My father, my mother, my two wives, and my five children all died of malaria. Only I was left, and I was tortured by this disease beyond recognition.” Speaking of this, Zhang Chongde paused with a complicated expression. After a long time, he said:
	“At that time, people used to say: Simao, Simao, the living cannot stay. At that time, the grain turned yellow and rotted in the fields; people caught malaria and lay sick in bed. I never thought I could live to this day. Alas, those old things are all in the past! Let's not talk about them! Let's talk about these last few years.”
	“I really didn't expect the good days to come so quickly, and the construction to be so fast. You see, in these few years, people's malaria has been cured, their bones have become strong, and they have the energy to do anything. The county yamen where the leopards gave birth has been demolished. Several neat buildings are the newly established Simao Middle School, where hundreds of students are studying. The place where the tigers used to eat horses is the office building of the Simao Post and Telecommunications Bureau. The post road where the dead horses stank has become a highway to Kunming. Look at the cinemas, bookstores, hotels, and shops on both sides of the highway."
	As he was speaking, Zhang Chongde's wife, a woman under thirty, came home from the cafeteria with food. She placed the food on a table. Zhang Chongde asked, "What are we eating today?"
	“We're eating bean curd rice. I've been wanting this for a long time!" Only then did I notice the room. Four pairs of carved wooden chairs and a carved square table were neatly arranged against the wall. A portrait of Chairman Mao was pasted on the opposite wall. Zhang Chongde started talking about this portrait:
	“I've been worshiping gods for decades. In the past, I lived in fear and trepidation before the gods, obediently suffering hardships. I never argued about anything, and everything was arranged by the gods. I didn't live freely at all! When the Communist Party came, I slowly realized that these things were all fake, all fabricated. So I tore up and burned the statues of the gods, and put a portrait of Chairman Mao in the place where the statues of the gods used to be."
	When the People's Liberation Army entered Simao City, Zhang Chongde was still working as a long-term laborer for a landlord. At that time, his spleen was so swollen that he couldn't even button his clothes. He had malaria every afternoon and could only work half a day. If he didn't work, the landlord wouldn't give him food or even water. He often wept sadly in bed, thinking that his ancestors had not accumulated virtue, and he thought about digging up the ancestral graves on the mountain several times.
	The working comrades of the People's Government convened farmers to discuss production plans and mobilized them to apply more fertilizer to increase grain production, but Zhang Chongde said:
	"As long as we can cure our malaria, let alone ten percent, we can increase production by thirty percent!" Many farmers agreed with Zhang Chongde's opinion.
	When the government began to eliminate malaria and mobilized everyone to take preventive medicine, Zhang Chongde's malaria flared up again. But he still followed the witch doctor's instructions and went to the old forests in the high mountains to avoid the malaria, and fainted on the mountain several times.
	Later, the Southwest Anti-Epidemic Team and the Anti-Malaria Team of the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army went to Simao. They held exhibitions of physical objects everywhere, showed slides, and explained how malaria parasites enter human blood. Everyone went to visit, and Zhang Chongde also looked at the specimen glass slide under the microscope once.
	From then on, Zhang Chongde no longer believed in any "malaria." Whether he was working in the fields or resting at home, the comrades from the anti-epidemic team delivered medicine and boiled water to him four times a day, and he happily swallowed it. As time went on, he felt very moved and thought: These comrades are so good. They left their relatives and came to the frontier to take care of us. He remembered that in the past, when people in the village had malaria, they hired doctors into the city to carry them there in sedan chairs. The doctor would give the patient a quinine pill for one silver dollar, and an injection of "Fubailong" would cost dozens of half-open (a kind of silver coin issued locally in Yunnan before liberation). Many poor people could not afford to see a doctor and had to lie down and wait to die. Zhang Chongde had suffered from malaria for half a month, and no one came to see him. He had a fever and was delirious, and he couldn't get a drop of water even if his tongue was parched and his mouth was dry. Zhang Chongde said painfully at a complaint meeting: "If the Communist Party had come earlier, our village would not have been destroyed; if the Communist Party had come earlier, my family would not have died."
	Many people, like Zhang Chongde, broke their superstition about "malaria."
	From the spring of 1953, a mass movement to eliminate malaria was launched in Simao County.
	Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the county mobilized, filled pits and ponds, cleaned ditches, hoeed weeds, and threw local medicines such as chinaberry, ailanthus, and fish skin into the ponds, killing a large number of malaria mosquito larvae. They sprayed wettable 666 powder in more than four million square meters of human rooms and cowsheds to eliminate malaria mosquitoes. Up to now, out of the twenty-four kinds of mosquitoes that have been found in the county, only four kinds are left, and none of these four kinds of mosquitoes transmit malaria. At the same time, the malaria prevention and treatment station checked the malaria situation of all ethnic groups in the county, and all patients received free treatment; the county also carried out social prevention and health prevention work. In 1953, more than 16,000 people in the county had malaria. After taking drugs such as Atabrine, quinine, Changshan pills, and Daraprim for a long time, the number decreased to more than 2,800 in 1958, and there are only a few patients this year. In Simao Dam, where malaria was most severe in the past, not a single local resident has been found to have malaria this year. Since 1953, the birth rate in the county has exceeded the death rate. Production has developed greatly. The cultivated land in the county has increased from more than 20,000 mu to more than 40,000 mu, and the yield per unit area of rice has increased from more than 200 jin at the time of liberation to more than 500 jin last year.
	Zhang Chongde's malaria has long been cured, and his body has slowly recovered. He was given land, cattle, and houses in the land reform struggle, and later married the daughter of a poor peasant. Since then, he ended his years of hired labor and had a warm family. He actively participated in mutual aid teams, agricultural cooperatives, and people's communes. Zhang Chongde told me with a smile: "Now, not only has my illness been cured, but I feel energetic all over. Everyone in the management area is like this. In 1953, we were still an agricultural cooperative. We finished reclaiming the wasteland in just two years. The more than 20,000 mu of wasteland on Simao Dam used to be covered with cogon grass more than a person deep. Now, it's all green rice fields. Later, we learned to grow double-cropping rice. Last year, we established a people's commune, and the crops were taken care of even better, and we had a great harvest of grain. The average yield per mu of two seasons of rice has increased more than threefold compared with the year of liberation. Right now, the early rice managed by our district is also harvesting well."

    思茅今昔
  　本报记者　叶子健
    这就是人们传说里的思茅“瘴气区”。
    眼前，思茅县的平坝和河谷：早稻正在收割，晚稻刚刚栽完，中稻已经低头了。那山边的旱地里，熟透了的菠萝散发着滋滋的香味，累累的香蕉从肥大的叶子间沉下来，望不到头的甘蔗长得比人还高。那些开镰割稻的人们，一转眼就把刚刚割下来的稻穗在“掼盆”里脱了粒，田野里一片熟闹的打稻声。夜里，思茅城灯火齐明，炼铁厂里铁花飞溅，机械厂里马达轰鸣，从烟囱里冒出的火星很快地消逝在漆黑的夜空里。思茅，像无量山脉里的一颗珍珠样叫人喜爱。
    在这崭新的景象面前，不禁想起思茅城在我军到达不久的一个冬天的情形。
    那时，我随着一队马帮，在千山万壑之中跋涉了几天，才到了思茅。田野里的荒草在疾风中摇曳，到处是铁蒺藜和仙人掌。在一块荒坝上，摆着一架飞机的残骸，我们前去看机身时，蓦地从机舱里窜出几条饿得很瘦的野狗。再往前不远，一匹死马卧在驿道边，几支啄食死马的老鸪被惊得低低飞起。思茅城，破烂的城门已经无法掩闭。夜里，城中没有灯火，街上没有行人。
    那天夜里，我和同行的几位同志交谈着这思茅“瘴气区”疟疾严重流行的情形，不远的地方传来野兽的悲叫声，我为思茅这个瘴区城市的荒凉景象，很久不能入睡。但，仅仅在这几年当中，当我第二次来到思茅的时候，她已经变得使人不能认识了。这天夜里，我住在新盖的思茅宾馆的大楼里，对门电影院正在放映“静静的顿河”，影片引起的观众的笑声，也使我很久很久不能入睡。
    第二天，县委会的同志领我去访问东风人民公社，公社副社长马文亮说：你要了解思茅县的变化，没有比老社员张崇德更合适的人了，在一群乳白色楼房附近的一个院子里。张崇德抱着他的胖儿子在院子里玩，他一见我就说：“幸亏有了党，要不我也活不到现在。”接着他说：
      “你可能不知道，过去这里年年有瘴气，许多人早上感到不舒服，到晚上就死了。思茅城里连国民党的县太爷也躲到高山上去了。”
      “说来你不相信”，老张看了看我笑着说：“那时豹子在县衙门里下崽子，老虎在大街上咬牛吃马。我住在三家村，距城里只有两里路，三十多户人家，都得瘴气病死了，我的阿爹阿妈和我前后两个妻子、五个儿女也都得瘴气病死了，只剩下我一个人，也着这种病折磨得不像人了。”说到这里，张崇德带着一种复杂的神情停下了，好久他才说：
    “那时候，人们都说：思茅思茅，活人不牢。那时候，谷子黄了，烂在田里；人着瘴气，病在床上。当时我那想活到现在，哎，这些老事都过去啦！不说啦！还是说这几年吧。”
    “真没有想到好日子来得这样快，建设得这样快。你看，这几年，人们的瘴气病好了，骨头硬了，干什么都有劲。豹子下崽的县衙门被拆掉了，齐齐整整地几幢楼房，是新办的思茅中学，眼下有几百个学生在那里读书。老虎吃马的地方，是思茅邮电局的办公楼。当年死马熏臭的驿道变成通昆明的公路，你看公路两边那电影院、书店、旅馆、商店。”
    正说着，张崇德的妻子，一个不到三十岁的妇女，从食堂里打饭回家来了。她在一张桌子上把饭摆起来。张崇德问道：“今天吃什么？”
  “吃豆花饭，这种饭我想了好久了！”这时我才注意看这屋里，挨墙整齐地摆着四对雕花的木椅和一张雕花的方桌，迎面墙上贴着毛主席像。张崇德又从这张像说起来：
      “我敬了几十年的神了，过去都是在神面前战战兢兢地过日子，服服贴贴地受苦难。凡事不去争辩，一切都由神安排，活得真不自由！等共产党来了，我才慢慢地看出来，这些东西都是假的，都是捏造的。于是我把神像撕掉烧了，在贴神像的地方贴上毛主席他老人家的像。”
    当解放军开进思茅城的时候，张崇德还给地主家当长工。那时他脾脏肿得连衣裳都扣不拢，每天下午发疟疾，一天只能干半天活。他不干活，地主就不管吃饭，连水也不给喝。他常在病榻上伤心流泪，以为祖宗没有积阴德，几次想上山把祖坟挖掉。
    人民政府的工作同志召集农民讨论生产计划，动员他们多施肥料，增产粮食，张崇德却说：
    “只要能把我们的瘴气病治好，莫说一成，增产三成也行！”许多农民都同意张崇德的意见。
    当政府着手消灭疟疾，动员大家都吞食预防药时，张崇德的疟疾又发起来。但他还是遵照巫师的嘱咐：到高山老箐里去避瘴气，不少次都昏倒在山上。
    后来，西南防疫队和解放军西南军区抗疟大队到思茅去了，到处举办实物展览，放映幻灯，讲解疟疾是怎样把疟原虫传进人的血液的？人人都去参观了，张崇德有一回也到显微镜下面看了标本玻璃片。
    从此张崇德不再相信什么“瘴气”了。不论在田间劳动，还是在家里休息，防疫队的同志一天四次把药和开水送到他手上，他都乐意地吞服下去。日子长了，他很有感触，心想：这些同志真好，他们丢开自己的亲人到边疆来照顾我们。他想起以前寨子里的人发疟疾时，进城把医生用轿子抬了去，医生给病人吃一粒奎宁，要一块银元，打一针“福白龙”要几十元半开（解放前云南地方出的一种银币）。许多穷人看不起病，只好躺着等死。张崇德那时打了半个月摆子，没有人去看望他，发烧发得神智不清，舌焦口燥也得不到一滴水喝。张崇德在一次诉苦会上痛心地说：“如果共产党早来，我们寨子不会毁；如果共产党早来，我一家人不会死。”
    许多人都像张崇德一样，破除了对“瘴气”的迷信。
    1953年春天起，思茅县全民消灭疟疾的群众运动掀起来了。
    全县人民在党的领导下动员起来，填坑塘、清理水沟、锄杂草，又用苦练子、冲天子、鱼行皮等土药丢进水塘，杀灭了大量的疟蚊幼虫。他们在四百多万平方公尺的人室牛棚中喷洒可湿性六六六粉消灭了疟蚊。到现在，全县已发现的二十四种蚊子，消灭得只剩四种了，这四种蚊子都不传染疟疾。同时，疟疾防治站检查了全县各族人民发疟疾的情况，病人都进行了免费治疗；全县并开展了社会性预防工作和健康性预防工作。1953年全县有一万六千多人发疟疾，这些人经先后长期服用阿的平、捕疟奎宁、常山丸和的乐君等药，到1958年减少到二千八百多人，今年只有几个病人了。过去疟疾病情最严重的思茅坝，今年没有发现一个本地人发疟疾。从1953年开始，全县出生率超过了死亡率。生产有了很大发展。全县耕地由二万多亩增加到了四万多亩，水稻的单位面积产量由解放时的二百多斤增加到去年的五百多斤。
    张崇德的疟疾早已得到了根治，身体慢慢地健康起来，他在土改斗争中分得了田地、牛和房子，后来又和一个贫农的女儿成了亲。从此，他结束了多少年的雇工生活，有了温暖的家庭。他积极地参加了互助组、农业社和人民公社。张崇德笑着告诉我：“现在，不光我的病治好了，觉得浑身是劲，全管理区的人都这样，1953年我们还是农业社，只用两年工夫就把荒地开完了，思茅坝子上的两万多亩荒地，以前只见一人多深的班茅草，现在绿茵茵尽是水田，以后我们又学会了种双季稻，去年办了人民公社，庄稼照顾得更好了，粮食得到了大丰收。两季水稻平均亩产比解放那年增加了三倍多，眼下，我们区管理的早稻又丰收了。”
