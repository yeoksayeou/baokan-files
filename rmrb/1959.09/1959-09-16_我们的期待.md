    Our Expectations

    After passing corresponding resolutions, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee concluded its three-day discussion on the Sino-Indian border issue on the 13th. The Indian Parliament's Council of States and House of the People also adjourned on the 10th and 12th, respectively. After a fierce debate, there is reason to expect that the tense situation in Sino-Indian relations over the past period can be eased.

    This is the second dispute between China and India in the past six months. Such a dispute, occurring between two traditionally friendly neighbors, is certainly not a pleasant thing. However, like the dispute in April and May of this year caused by India's interference in China's internal affairs during the Tibetan rebellion, the responsibility for this uproar over the Sino-Indian border issue does not lie with China, but with some individuals in India who deliberately provoked it. These schemers, hostile to Sino-Indian friendship, seeing themselves in a very awkward position due to their involvement in the Tibetan rebellion, fabricated rumors of Chinese troops "invading" Indian territory months ago, systematically stirring up a new anti-China wave. Regrettably, our respected Prime Minister Nehru did not maintain the proper level of wisdom in this matter and was also drawn into this vortex. In the eyes of right-wing politicians, members of parliament, and even some officials in India, China's "silence" was a sign of weakness, and therefore they seemed to have nothing to fear, attacking China with increasing malice and vehemently demanding that China express its position. Thus, having reached the limit of our tolerance, we had no choice but to respond to their slander, making the truth known to the world, partly to satisfy their demands, and more importantly, to clarify the facts. Even in this situation, we still cannot help but feel regret that our dispute had to involve Prime Minister Nehru, because many of his more than ten speeches on Sino-Indian relations in the past month cannot be considered fair and consistent with the facts. Originally, we did not hope or want to do this.

    Of course, there is no reason to believe that this dispute over the Sino-Indian border issue is only negative. At the very least, after this dispute, the positions of both China and India have been clarified; for all those who care about Sino-Indian friendly relations, the truth about the Sino-Indian border issue is out in the open. Here, we have no intention of repeating this dispute, but people can at least understand that there is no such thing as China invading Indian territory. On the contrary, India has not only drawn Sino-Indian boundaries far to the east and north of the traditional Sino-Indian border line that have never been recognized by the Chinese government, but has also sent troops across the border to occupy more than a dozen places in China. The Indian side cannot produce any evidence of Chinese troops invading Indian territory in any place, and in fact, there is no such thing at all. After this dispute, people can at least see that there are fundamental differences between China and India regarding the Sino-Indian border issue. These are: (1) The Chinese side believes that the approximately 2,000-kilometer border between China and India has never been formally demarcated, and there has never been a formal treaty or agreement approved by the governments of the two countries to determine the boundary between the two countries; the Indian side believes that the boundary line marked on the current Indian map is the boundary line between China and India, which is obviously a unilateral decision and an attempt to impose it on the other side. (2) The Chinese side believes that the McMahon Line is the product of British imperialism's aggressive policy towards Tibet, China, and is illegal, and no Chinese central government has ever recognized it; the Indian side believes that the McMahon Line is the Sino-Indian border east of Bhutan, based solely on the illegal documents secretly exchanged by McMahon and representatives of the Tibetan local authorities behind the back of the Chinese central government and the Simla Treaty, which was never approved by the Chinese central government. Such differences have long existed, and have now been clarified after this dispute. This is certainly beneficial for China and India to understand each other's positions, especially for the Indian side to understand China's firm position and avoid misunderstandings, so as to consider how to reasonably resolve the Sino-Indian border issue.

    How to resolve the border issue between China and India? The Chinese government's position has been clearly put forward in Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru on September 8 and in the resolution passed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on September 13. These are: (1) In view of the fact that the entire Sino-Indian border has not been formally demarcated, the Chinese government has consistently advocated that China and India should consider the historical background and the current actual situation, and comprehensively resolve the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultations, prepared and step by step, in accordance with the Five Principles. Such a comprehensive solution is a once-and-for-all solution for both China and India.

    (2) The Chinese government has advocated in the past and still advocates now that, as a temporary measure before a comprehensive solution is reached, both sides should maintain the long-existing state of the border, and not change this state by unilateral action, let alone by the use of force. This is particularly important at present. China has not, does not, and will never change this situation by unilateral action, let alone use force for this purpose. We expect the Indian government to take the same attitude and quickly withdraw from the Chinese territory it recently occupied. If this can be done, the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border will be immediately eliminated.

    (3) The Chinese government has also consistently advocated that for some disputes, local and temporary agreements can be reached through negotiations to ensure the tranquility of the border and maintain the friendship between the two countries.

    This is the Chinese government's reasonable, conciliatory, and friendly attitude, a manifestation of utmost benevolence and righteousness. We eagerly hope and expect that China's reasonable, conciliatory, and friendly attitude on the Sino-Indian border issue will also receive a corresponding response from the Indian side.

    China and India are two friendly countries, and at the same time, they are well-known initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Therefore, our two countries should attach importance to friendship in dealing with any issues related to Sino-Indian relations, and should become models for implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Since China and India have always advocated that all international disputes should be resolved through peaceful consultation, as two friendly countries, we should firmly adhere to this principle to resolve disputes between our two countries. The Chinese side has always done this for many years. We will not forget that, under the leadership of Prime Minister Nehru, the Indian government has also done things that have benefited Sino-Indian friendship in the spirit of Panchsheel (the Five Principles). Although in the past, there have been disputes between China and India on certain issues, and there have been incidents of the Indian side crossing the border on the Sino-Indian border, they have all been handled with a friendly attitude and have not become a big deal. Therefore, Sino-Indian relations were originally satisfactory. Although, since the rebellion in Tibet this spring, the Indian side has openly interfered in our internal affairs, followed by continuous violations and occupation of our territory on the Sino-Indian border, and at the same time launched a fervent anti-China movement, creating a temporary tension in Sino-Indian relations, we have noticed that Prime Minister Nehru has repeatedly stated in the Indian Parliament recently that India will still adhere to the diplomatic policy based on the principles of Panchsheel, advocating resolving the Sino-Indian border issue through peaceful consultation, and expressing its efforts to maintain Sino-Indian friendship. These remarks have undoubtedly been valued and welcomed. We are willing to say frankly that we hope the Indian authorities can be consistent in their words and deeds. Since the Indian authorities have made the above statement, we have even more reason to demand, as hoped for in the resolution of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on September 13, that India should immediately stop the anti-China movement (including the anti-China activities carried out in India by some people using the Dalai Lama and Tibetan rebels), quickly withdraw from all the places occupying Chinese territory, and start friendly negotiations with China to peacefully resolve the border issue.

    We hope that the storm over the Sino-Indian border issue provoked by certain people with ulterior motives on the Indian side can subside. We know very well that any tension between China and India will only benefit imperialism and its agents, and will be very detrimental to the people of China and India. The friendship between the two great nations of China and India has a history of nearly two thousand years, and we must maintain this friendship for thousands of years to come. The six-month anti-China movement created by a small number of people in India who are hostile to Sino-Indian friendship is insignificant compared to the power of the great friendship of the one billion people of our two countries; compared to the history of thousands of years of Sino-Indian friendship, it is only an episode. We hope that our Indian friends will share a common belief with us: the dark clouds appearing over the Himalayas are temporary, and the traditional friendship between the people of China and India will shine like the sun, forever radiating its undying light.

### 我们的期待

    我们的期待
    我国的全国人民代表大会常务委员会在通过了相应的决议之后，已于13日结束了为期三天的关于中印边界问题的讨论。印度议会的联邦院和人民院也在10日和12日先后宣告休会。在一场激烈的争论之后，人们有理由期待过去一个时期内中印关系的紧张局势能够缓和下来。
    在过去的半年中，中印之间的争论，这已经是第二次了。这样的争论，发生在两个向来和睦相处的邻邦之间，诚然不是令人愉快的事情。但是，如同今年4、5月间由于印度在西藏叛乱事件中干涉中国内政而引起的争论一样，这次关于中印边界问题的轩然大波，其责任不在中国方面，而是印度有些别有用心的分子有意挑起来的。这些敌视中印友谊的阴谋家，鉴于他们因插手西藏叛乱而处于十分尴尬的地位，早在几个月以前就制造了所谓中国军队侵入印度国境的谣言，有计划地掀起一个新的反华浪潮。令人惋惜的是，我们尊敬的尼赫鲁总理对此没有保持应有的明智态度，竟然也被卷入这个漩涡中去了。在印度的右翼政客、议员以至某些官员看来，中国的“沉默”是软弱的表示，因而他们似乎是有恃无恐，越来越恶毒地攻击中国，声色俱厉地要求中国表示态度。于是，忍无可忍，我们只好起来回答他们的诽谤，把真相公诸于世，一方面是为了满足他们的要求，另方面，更重要的是为了弄清是非。即便在这种情况下，仍然使我们不能不感到遗憾的是，我们的争论不能不涉及到尼赫鲁总理，这是因为他在过去一个月中发表的十多次有关中印关系的谈话中有不少是不能被认为是公允和符合事实的。本来我们并不希望也不愿意这样做。
    当然，没有任何理由认为，这次关于中印边界问题的争论只是消极性的东西。至少，经过这次争论，对于中印双方来说，彼此的立场阐述得更明确了；对于一切关心中印友好关系的人们来说，中印边界问题的真相大白于天下了。在这里，我们无意重复这个争论，但是，人们至少可以了解：根本不存在所谓中国侵犯印度的领土，恰恰相反，印度不但在传统的中印边界线以东和以北很远的地方划下了从来未经中国政府承认的中印国界，而且还派遣军队越境侵占着中国的十几个地方。印度方面举不出中国军队在任何一个地方侵入印度领土，事实上也根本不存在这样的事情。经过这次争论，人们至少也可以看到：关于中印边界问题，中国和印度之间存在着根本分歧。这就是：（一）中国方面认为，中印之间的大约二千公里的边界从来没有正式划定过，历史上从来没有经过两国政府批准的关于确定两国边界的正式条约和协定；印度方面则认为，印度现行地图上所标明的界线就是中印两国的边界线，这显然是单方面决定而企图强加于另一方面的。（二）中国方面认为，麦克马洪线是英帝国主义对中国西藏地方执行侵略政策的产物，是非法的，没有任何一个中国中央政府曾经承认过的；印度方面则认为，麦克马洪线是不丹以东的中印国界，根据仅仅是麦克马洪和西藏地方当局的代表背着中国中央政府秘密交换的非法文件和根本没有得到中国中央政府批准的西姆拉条约。这样的分歧，本来久已存在，现在经过这次争论明朗化了。这对于中印双方相互了解彼此的立场，特别是使印度方面了解中国的坚定不移的立场而不致有所误解，从而考虑如何合理地解决中印边界问题，当然是有好处的。
    怎样解决中印两国边界问题？中国政府的主张已经在周恩来总理9月8日给尼赫鲁总理的信中和全国人民代表大会常务委员会9月13日通过的决议中，明确地提出来了。这就是：（一）鉴于中印边界全部没有正式划定过，中国政府一贯主张，中印双方应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，有准备有步骤地通过友好协商，全面解决两国边界问题。这种全面解决，无论对中国和印度，都是一劳永逸。
    （二）中国政府过去和现在都是主张，在全面解决之前，作为临时性的措施，双方应该维持边界久已存在的状况，而不以片面行动，更不应该使用武力改变这种状况。这在目前特别重要。中国过去没有、现在和将来也决不会以片面行动改变这种状况，更绝不会为此而使用武力。我们期待印度政府也采取同样的态度，迅速撤出不久前侵占的中国领土。果能如此，中印边境的紧张局势马上就会消除。
    （三）中国政府也一贯主张，对于一部分争执，还可以通过谈判达成局部性和临时性的协议，以保证边界的安宁，维护两国的友谊。
    这是中国政府合理的、和解的和友好的态度，仁至义尽的态度。我们热切地希望着和期待着，中国方面在中印边界问题上的这种合理的、和解的和友好的态度，也能够得到印度方面相应的回答。
    中国和印度是两个友好的国家，同时又是著名的和平共处五项原则的倡议者，因此我们两国在对待有关中印关系的任何问题上，都应该以友谊为重，并且应该成为执行和平共处五项原则的模范。中印两国既然一向主张，一切国际争端都应该通过和平协商方式解决，那么作为两个友好国家，我们更应该坚决根据这个原则来解决两国之间的争端。多年以来，中国方面一直就是这样做的。我们也不会忘记，在尼赫鲁总理的领导下，印度政府根据潘查希拉（五项原则）的精神，也做过有益于中印友谊的事情。虽然过去在某些问题上，中印双方也有过争执，在中印边境上也发生过印度方面越境的事件，但都由于采取了友好的态度加以处理，没有成为轩然大波。因此，中印关系本来是令人满意的。虽然，从今年春天西藏发生叛乱以后，印度方面竟公然干涉我国内政，继之以在中印边境上接连侵犯和侵占我国领土，同时掀起狂热的反华运动，造成了中印关系的一时的紧张，但是，我们注意到，尼赫鲁总理最近在印度议会中一再申明，印度仍然要坚持执行以潘查希拉为原则的外交政策，主张用和平协商方式解决中印边界问题，并表示要努力维护中印友好。这些言论无疑地受到重视和欢迎。我们愿意坦率地说，我们希望印度当局能够言行一致。既然印度当局作了上述的表示，我们就更加有理由要求，如像我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会9月13日的决议中所希望的，印度应当立即停止反华运动（包括有人利用达赖喇嘛和西藏叛乱分子在印度进行的反华活动），迅速退出侵占中国领土的所有地点，同中国开始和平解决边界问题的友好谈判。
    我们希望，由印度方面某些别有用心的人所挑起的这一场关于中印边界问题的风波，能够平息下去。我们深知，中印双方的任何紧张关系，都只会对帝国主义及其代理人有利，而对中印两国人民是十分不利的。中印两大民族的友谊已经有近两千年的历史了，今后我们还要千年万年地维护这种友谊。印度一小部分敌视中印友谊的人们所制造的六个月的反华运动，比起我们两国十亿人民的伟大友谊的力量，是渺小的；比起千年万年的中印友谊的历史来，不过是一段插曲。我们希望，印度的朋友们将同我们有着一个共同信念：出现在喜马拉雅山上空的黑云是暂时的，中印两国人民的传统友谊将像太阳一样，永远放射着不灭的光芒。
