Friends Cheer for the Achievements of Our Sports Undertakings
— Visiting Sports Representatives of Brotherly Countries at the National Games
By our reporters Lian Yunshan, Ai Tiemin

The first National Games of our country have not only attracted the attention of the people of the whole country, but also the attention of sports workers from all over the world, especially from brotherly countries. At the New Qiao Hotel in the capital, reporters interviewed sports representatives from eleven brotherly countries including the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, North Korea, Vietnam and Mongolia, who spoke with great excitement about their impressions of the National Games and the development of mass sports in our country, as well as their visits to Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places.

The convening of the first National Games is not only a major event in Chinese sports, but also something that the people and athletes of socialist countries are very concerned about and happy about. This National Games was a great success. It marks the rapid progress of Chinese sports. This is the common feeling of the sports representatives of the brotherly countries. M. Pishlyak, Vice Chairman of the Soviet Sports Association and the Federation of Sports Organizations, told reporters: "The holding of the first National Games on the eve of the historically significant 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is of special importance. It shows the care and attention of the Chinese Communist Party and the government to sports, and shows the heroic spirit of Chinese athletes to welcome this great celebration with excellent results. In the various competitions of the National Games, Chinese athletes have created many good results, not only breaking many national records of 1958, but also breaking three world records. China has many excellent athletes in track and field, weightlifting, swimming, table tennis, etc., and a large number of new excellent athletes have emerged this time. The achievements of this National Games show the rapid improvement of Chinese sports and the vigorous development of mass sports."

Fr. Vodes, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation, is visiting China for the first time. He said enthusiastically: The National Games gave me an extremely good impression from the opening ceremony. The scale of the National Games is so large, and the programs are very wonderful. At the opening ceremony, I saw the excellent team of athletes selected from more than 50 million athletes across the country, all of whom were full of energy, healthy and happy; at the same time, I saw a very beautiful group calisthenics performance, which concentratedly showed the strength of the Chinese athletes and the improvement of their sports level.

Sports representatives from other brotherly countries also gave high praise to the colorful gymnastics performances at the opening ceremony. I. Nikolov, First Vice Chairman of the Bulgarian Sports Federation, said excitedly: It is valuable that each program has political content, not only are the movements neat and beautiful, but the naming is also very meaningful. He said that it is quite difficult to organize such a large-scale mass gymnastics performance, but you have organized it very well. The more difficult technical performances and gymnastics of children are done beautifully and easily, which shows the achievements of the Chinese Communist Party in conducting moral, physical, and intellectual education for children in an all-round way. The Bulgarian guest also praised the celebration dance of the wheat waves rolling and the eyebrow stick fight, which have Chinese national characteristics. Kim Ki-soo, Chairman of the Sports Guidance Committee of the Korean Cabinet, and Tran Chi Hien, Member of the Sports and Gymnastics Committee of Vietnam, as well as Comrade Yadam Surun, Chairman of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the Mongolian People's Republic, believe that the group calisthenics performance at the opening ceremony is extremely rich in content, high in technical level, and perfect in artistic conception, which shows the organizational strength and rich life content of the Chinese people, just like flowers blooming together. Bievchaiwich, Deputy Director of the International Department of the Polish Sports Commission, said that he had never seen a mass sports performance organized so compactly and skillfully. He was especially surprised that these performances were rehearsed by middle school and primary school students in their spare time. Gyula Heki, the 60-year-old Chairman of the Hungarian Sports Commission, told reporters that the wonderful performance at the opening ceremony of the National Games, from the perspective of sports technology, every program, even the children's gymnastics, has a very high level.

Friends from brotherly countries generally believe that the many excellent results in the gymnastics performance and various competitions of the National Games are the concentrated expression of the Chinese Communist Party and the government's emphasis on developing mass sports, and also the result of the great leap forward of Chinese athletes under the correct guidance of the general line of the Chinese Communist Party. The completion of the Beijing Workers' Stadium, a modern sports building with complete equipment and a large scale, within one year is an example of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's emphasis on the development of sports.

When the representatives visited Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan and other cities, they also saw many well-equipped stadiums and gymnasiums, and also saw the vigorous development of mass sports. Rudi Leicht, Chairman of the German Democratic Republic Sports Federation, praised the extensiveness of Chinese sports. He said that there is a basketball court next to the hotel in Shanghai where he stayed, and people often play basketball. Many people do gymnastics on the Huangpu River every morning, and when visiting a commune in the suburbs of Guangzhou, he saw the commune members playing basketball. There are many swimming pools in several places he has visited, and many people are swimming. It can be seen that the great achievements of Chinese sports are not accidental. Kalaguni, a member of the Albanian Sports Commission who visited China two years ago, said that after visiting China again after two years, he saw that China's leap forward was really progressing at a rapid pace. Sports has also achieved great results. Potnarashi, Chairman of the Romanian Sports Federation, who has visited China three times, said that sports cannot be separated from politics. The great achievements of Chinese sports were only possible under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the overthrow of the reactionary rule. He said that China's sports has reached the world level, and the imperialists have created the despicable conspiracy of "two Chinas" to obstruct China from participating in international sports organizations. However, Romanian athletes and people support China, and socialist countries also support China.

Friends are happy for the great achievements we have made in sports. Pishlyak, Vice Chairman of the Soviet Sports Association and the Federation of Sports Organizations, told reporters enthusiastically: Just from the fact that there are 100 million people in China who regularly participate in sports, China is already one of the advanced countries in the world in terms of sports development, and Chinese athletes have already stepped onto the international stage. He said that Soviet athletes and the Soviet people are naturally happy for the great achievements of Chinese athletes and Chinese sports. Athletes from China and the Soviet Union have had friendly contacts for a long time, and friendly competitions are held many times every year, which not only helps to improve technical level, but also strengthens the friendship between the people of the two countries. On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, Soviet athletes warmly congratulate Chinese athletes and celebrate their good results in the National Games.

    朋友为我们体育事业的成就欢呼
    ——访参观全运会的兄弟国家体育代表
    本报记者　连云山　艾铁民
    我国第一届全国运动会，不仅吸引了全国人民，而且吸引了世界各国，特别是兄弟国家的体育工作者的注视。在首都新侨饭店里，记者访问了来自苏、波、捷、德、匈、罗、保、阿、朝、越、蒙等十一个兄弟国家的前来参观全运会的体育代表，他们都以极其兴奋的心情，畅谈了对我国的全国运动会和开展群众性体育运动的观感，以及参观和访问上海、广州等地的印象。
    第一届全国运动会的召开，不但是中国体育运动的大事，同时也是社会主义阵营各国人民和运动员们非常关心并感到高兴的事。这次全运会开得很成功。它标志着中国体育运动的突飞猛进。这是兄弟国家体育代表们的共同感触。苏联体育协会和体育组织联合会副主席米·彼斯利亚克对记者这样说：“在具有历史意义的日子——中华人民共和国建国十周年前夕，举行第一届全国运动会具有特殊重要意义，它表明了中国共产党和政府对体育事业的关怀和重视，表明了中国运动员以优良的成绩迎接这个伟大庆典的豪迈心情。在全运会的各项比赛中，中国运动员创造了许多很好的成绩，不仅刷新了多项1958年的全国纪录，而且，还打破了三个世界纪录。在田径、举重、游泳、乒乓球等方面，中国都拥有不少优秀的选手，这次又出现了大批新的优秀选手。这次全运会的成就，说明了中国体育运动水平的迅速提高和群众性体育运动的蓬勃开展。”
    捷克斯洛伐克体育总会主席弗·伏德斯是第一次来中国访问，他热情地说：全运会从开幕式起就给了我极其美好的印象，全运会的规模是这样大，节目都非常精彩。在开幕式上，我看到了从全国五千多万运动员中选拔出来的优秀选手队伍，个个精神饱满，健美愉快；同时看到了非常优美的团体操表演，这集中表现了中国运动员队伍的强大和运动水平的提高。
    其它各兄弟国家的体育代表，对开幕式上丰富多彩的体操表演，也都给了很高的评价。保加利亚体育联合会第一副主席依·尼科洛夫兴奋地说：可贵的是每个节目都具有政治内容，不但动作整齐优美，而且命名很有意义。他说，组织那样大规模的群众性体操表演是相当困难的，可是你们组织得很好，那些动作比较难的技巧表演和少年儿童的体操做得很优美和轻松愉快，这说明了中国共产党对儿童进行德育、体育和智育全面教育的成就。这位保加利亚客人还盛赞麦浪滚滚的庆丰收舞和齐眉棍对打具有中国民族特色。朝鲜内阁体育指导委员会委员长金基洙和越南体育体操委员会委员陈志贤，以及蒙古人民共和国体委主席雅达姆苏伦同志认为：开幕式上的团体操表演内容极其丰富，技术水平很高，艺术构思完美，这表示了中国人民的组织力量和丰富的生活内容，真像齐放的花朵一样。波兰体育运动委员会国际司副司长别弗柴维奇说：他还没有见到过群众性的体育表演组织得如此紧凑和巧妙。尤其使他惊奇的是：这些表演是中学和小学生利用课余时间排练出来的。六十岁的匈牙利体育运动委员会主席久拉·赫基告诉记者，全运会开幕式上的精彩表演，从体育技术的观点来看，每个节目，乃至少年体操都具有很高的水平。
    兄弟国家的朋友们共同认为：全运会的体操表演和各项竞赛中出现的许多优良成绩，是中国共产党和政府重视发展群众性体育运动的集中表现，也是中国运动员们在中国共产党的总路线的正确指导下大跃进的结果。北京工人体育场这样一座设备完善、规模宏大的现代化体育建筑，在一年之内修成，就是中国共产党和人民政府重视发展体育运动的例证。
    代表们在上海、杭州、广州、武汉等城市参观时，也看到了不少设备完善的体育场、馆，也看到了群众性体育运动蓬勃开展的状况。德意志民主共和国体育总会主席鲁迪·莱希特盛赞中国体育运动开展的广泛性。他说，在上海住的旅馆旁边就有篮球场，经常有人在打球，在黄浦江边每天早晨也有很多人在做体操，在广州郊区的一个公社参观时，看到那里社员们在打篮球。到过的几个地方都有不少游泳池，有许多人在游泳。由此可见，中国体育运动的巨大成就不是偶然的。两年前曾访问过中国的阿尔巴尼亚体委委员卡拉古尼说：两年后再访中国，看到中国的跃进真是一日千里。体育事业也同样取得重大成就。三次访问过中国的罗马尼亚体育总会主席波特纳拉希说：体育是不能离开政治的。中国体育运动的巨大成就是在伟大的中国共产党领导下，推翻了反动统治，才有可能取得的。他说，中国的体育事业已经达到了世界水平，帝国主义竟制造“两个中国”的卑鄙阴谋，阻挠中国参加国际体育组织。但是，罗马尼亚的运动员和人民支持中国，社会主义国家也都支持中国。
    朋友们为我们在体育事业上所取得的重大成就而高兴。苏联体育协会和体育组织联合会副主席彼斯利亚克热情地对记者说：仅仅从中国有一亿人经常参加体育运动这一事实来说，中国就已经是世界上体育发展的先进国家之一，中国的运动员已经登上了国际舞台。他说，苏联运动员和苏联人民，为中国运动员和中国体育事业的巨大成就而自然感到高兴。中苏两国运动员很早就有了友好的联系，每年都举行多次的友好比赛，这不仅有助于提高技术水平，同时加强了两国人民的友谊。在伟大的中华人民共和国建国十周年前夕，苏联运动员热烈地向中国运动员祝贺，庆贺他们在全运会上取得良好的成绩。
