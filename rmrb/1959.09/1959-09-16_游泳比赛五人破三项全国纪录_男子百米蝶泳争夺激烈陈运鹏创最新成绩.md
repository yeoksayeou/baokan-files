Xinhua News Agency, 15th – Good news kept pouring in from the Beijing Gymnasium swimming pool. Today, on the second day of the swimming competition of the First National Games, five athletes broke three national records. Shanghai athlete Chen Yunpeng won the championship in the men's 100-meter butterfly final and set a new national record of 1 minute 3.2 seconds. Liu Furan from the People's Liberation Army also performed excellently in this event, with a time of 1 minute 3.3 seconds, both breaking the previous national record of 1 minute 4.3 seconds. In the women's 100-meter backstroke preliminary, Shanghai athlete Zhou Yongqi achieved a time of 1 minute 19.1 seconds, breaking the national record of 1 minute 20.4 seconds. Shanghai athlete Dai Lihua won the women's 100-meter freestyle championship with a time of 1 minute 9.4 seconds, and Fujian's Fu Cuimei came in second with a time of 1 minute 9.7 seconds, both breaking the national record of 1 minute 9.8 seconds.

The men's 100-meter butterfly final was extremely competitive. The champion, Chen Yunpeng, and the runner-up, Liu Furan, were very close throughout the race. It was only about fifteen meters from the finish line when Chen Yunpeng took a deep breath and stroked eleven times in a row to reach the finish line first. Liu Furan finished only 0.1 seconds behind him. This is the first time that our athletes have competed so fiercely at such a high level in this event. The other six athletes who won places in this event also achieved results within the Sports Master standard of 1 minute 8 seconds.

The men's 100-meter freestyle final aroused great interest among the audience. The athletes were almost neck and neck after entering the water. Finally, Guangdong's Lin Jinzhu "sprinted" vigorously with powerful strokes and reached the finish line first, with a time of 57.7 seconds. The second place was Hebei's Mu Ruilong, with 58.5 seconds, and the third place was Beijing's Lin Kechun, with 59.2 seconds. The results of the fourth to sixth place athletes were also within 60 seconds. This is also the first time that such a high level and fierce competition has appeared in our 100-meter freestyle race.

Today also held the women's 100-meter breaststroke, men's 100-meter backstroke, and 400-meter freestyle finals. In the women's 100-meter breaststroke final, Guangdong athlete Zhou Yueping unexpectedly defeated Shanghai athlete Liu Yusen, who had broken the national record many times this year, and won the national championship with a time of 1 minute 27.9 seconds. The men's 100-meter backstroke championship was won by Beijing's Wang Qiangli, with a time of 1 minute 8.6 seconds. Guangdong athlete Fu Dajin also won the men's 400-meter freestyle final over the national record holder, Guangdong's Li Xiqing, with a time of 4 minutes 49.8 seconds. (Attached picture)
