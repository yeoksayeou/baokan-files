A Fierce Battle Between Powerful Teams
——A Record of the Polo Championship
By Our Correspondent Liao Youbin

On the polo field under the Daqingshan Mountains in Hohhot, the sound of the bronze gong rang, the steeds galloped, and the polo ball flew. In the National Games polo competition, the Inner Mongolia team and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) team, two powerful teams that had won all eight of their matches, met on the 20th, starting a tense and fierce polo championship battle.

The Inner Mongolia team, known for its skilled polo techniques, used lightning-fast long passes to bypass the PLA team's forwards and defenders, fiercely attacking the goal and scoring the first point within two minutes of the start of the game. After losing a goal, the young PLA team became somewhat nervous, and their formation was slightly disrupted. Before long, the Inner Mongolia team's main player, Deminghai (Mongolian), dribbled the ball into the goal, losing another point.

At this time, the PLA team changed its tactics to strengthen its defense, adopting a strategy of two players attacking and two players defending. Although this strengthened the defensive force, it weakened the offensive force. Many balls looked as if they were heading straight for the opponent's goal, but when the forward missed the shot, the defender couldn't respond, losing scoring opportunities. By the end of the first chukker (each chukker is eighteen minutes), they were behind by three to zero.

At the beginning of the second chukker, the PLA team was full of fighting spirit and vigor. Based on the team's characteristic of fast horses, they changed to an offensive-minded tactic, actively striving for the initiative. One minute later, they shot the ball into the goal and scored a point. The situation on the field suddenly became tense, and the two sides fought more and more fiercely. Before long, the PLA team scored another point. By the end of the first half, the score was four to two, with the Inner Mongolia team temporarily leading by two points.

At the beginning of the third chukker of the second half, the PLA team, with even greater fighting spirit, became more active, lengthened its formation, closely marking the Inner Mongolia team's main forwards, Saijilah (Mongolian) and Changsheng (Mongolian), while also taking the initiative to attack. In an instant, the red flag at the goal was raised high, and the PLA team scored another point, making the score four to three. At this time, both sides launched fierce attacks against each other, forming a seesaw battle. Sometimes the polo ball rolled towards the Inner Mongolia team's goal area, but before the PLA team could extend their mallets to hit the ball, it had been counterattacked by the Inner Mongolia team, causing the polo ball to circle near the PLA team's goal. The two sides fought fiercely until the end of the third chukker, and neither side was able to score another goal.

The fourth chukker was the decisive battle for both sides to win the polo championship. The technically skilled Inner Mongolia team was somewhat restrained at this time, not daring to attack boldly, while the PLA team, determined to win, launched an attack with all its forces. In less than one round, the PLA team hit the ball and scored, making it four all. At this time, the Inner Mongolia team reorganized and launched a full counterattack. Forward number one, Saijilah, broke through the encirclement and pursuit of several horses with his skillful ball skills, dribbled the ball into the PLA team's goal, and scored. The Inner Mongolia team took the lead again with five to four. The end of the game was approaching, and people thought that the Inner Mongolia team could稳拿(guaranteed) the championship, but the PLA team was not discouraged and continued to launch a fierce attack. In just one minute, they scored another goal, making it five all. At this time, the atmosphere on the field was very tense. In the last three minutes, the PLA team became more and more courageous, breaking through the opponent's defense line several times, light cavalry dribbling the ball towards the goal, but unfortunately, they were too eager to win and missed the shot. The Inner Mongolia team carefully defended on one side, while looking for opportunities to attack on the other, but they were unsuccessful due to the opponent's strong defensive strength. In the end, the two sides tied at five all.

    雄师遇劲旅
    ——记马球冠军争夺战
    本报记者　廖由滨
    在呼和浩特大青山下的马球场上，铜锣声响，骏马奔腾，马球飞滚。在全运会马球比赛中都八战八捷的内蒙古队和解放军队两支劲旅，20日相遇，一场紧张激烈的马球冠军争夺战开始了。
    素以马球技术娴熟著称的内蒙古队，以闪电式的长传球，越过解放军队的前锋和后卫，猛叩球门，开赛两分钟后即首开纪录先得一分。年轻的解放军队输了一球以后，队员们有些紧张，阵营稍乱，不多久又被内蒙古队主力队员德明海（蒙古族）带球入门，又输一分。
    这时，解放军队为了加强防守，变换了战术，采用两人进攻两人防守的办法。这样虽然防守力量加强，却又减弱了进攻力量，有不少球，眼看直逼对方球门，但当前锋击球失误时，后卫接应不上，失掉了得分机会，到赛程第一局（每局十八分钟）结束时，以零比三落后。
    第二局一开始，解放军队斗志旺盛，干劲十足，根据本队马快的特点，又改为以攻为守的战术，积极争取主动权，一分钟后即击球入门得了一分。场上战局顿形紧张，双方愈战愈烈，不久解放军队又得一分，到了上半场终，场上比分是四比二，内蒙古队暂以多二分领先。
    下半场第三局开始，斗志愈加昂扬的解放军队更加活跃，拉长阵势，死盯住内蒙古队前锋主力队员赛吉拉呼（蒙古族）和常胜（蒙古族），同时更加主动地进攻，刹那间球门红旗高举，解放军队又得一分，场上记录成了四比三。这时双方互相猛烈进攻，形成拉锯，时而马球滚向内蒙古队的球门禁区，但不等解放军队伸棍击球，已被内蒙古队反击回来，使得马球又在解放军队的球门附近周旋，就这样双方酣战到第三局终了，都未能再射入一球。
    第四局，是双方谁能夺得马球冠军具有决定性的最后一仗。技术熟练的内蒙古队，这时有些拘谨，不敢大胆进攻，而一心求胜的解放军队，却以全部兵力展开进攻，不到一个回合，解放军队就击球得中，成了四平。此时，内蒙古队重整旗鼓，全力反攻，前锋一号队员赛吉拉呼以他娴熟的球技冲破数马的包围和追赶，脱群带球进入解放军队的球门，射中得分。内蒙古队又以五比四领先。终场时间快到了，人们都认为内蒙古队已可稳拿冠军，但解放军队并不气馁，再接再厉发起猛攻，仅隔一分钟即射入一球，打成五平。这时场上的气氛十分紧张，临到最后三分钟，解放军队越战越勇，几次突破对方防线，轻骑带球叩门，可惜求胜心切没有射中，内蒙古队一边加意防守，一边伺机进攻，但阻于对方强劲的守力，没有成功，最后双方打到五平结束。
