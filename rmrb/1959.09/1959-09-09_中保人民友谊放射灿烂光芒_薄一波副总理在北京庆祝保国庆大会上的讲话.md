Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

Tomorrow is the fifteenth anniversary of the Bulgarian socialist revolution. People from all walks of life in our capital are gathering here with boundless excitement to hold a grand meeting celebrating this great festival. On behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I extend my warmest congratulations to the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian government, and the Bulgarian people.

The Bulgarian people are heroic, industrious, and peace-loving people with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Bulgarian people have waged a heroic and successive struggle for national independence and liberation. During World War II, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people vigorously launched a heroic armed struggle against the occupation of Hitler and the fascist dictatorship. On September 9, 1944, the Bulgarian people, with the direct help of the Soviet army, finally staged an armed uprising, overthrew the royal fascist rule, ended the occupation of fascist Germany, and won a glorious victory of historical significance. Since then, Bulgaria has been forever freed from fascist rule and embarked on the road of democratic and socialist development. For the first time in their history, the Bulgarian people have become masters of the country. The Chinese people have always been heartened and encouraged by this historic victory of Bulgaria and the rebirth of the Bulgarian people.

In the years of the people's regime after liberation, the hardworking and courageous Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party, have devoted all their energy and enthusiasm to the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

In the past, Bulgaria under the monarchical autocratic era was an economically backward country, and the working people were in a dire situation of political disenfranchisement, poverty, and cultural backwardness. However, in the short fifteen years since liberation, Bulgaria has undergone fundamental changes. The dark, backward, and impoverished Bulgaria is gone forever. After restoring the economy and consolidating the regime, the Bulgarian people have achieved brilliant achievements in building their new life. As a result of the Bulgarian Communist Party's unwavering implementation of the policy of socialist industrialization, socialist industry has developed rapidly. Bulgaria has established heavy industrial sectors such as the metallurgical industry, chemical industry, machine manufacturing industry, shipbuilding industry, and electric power industry, which did not exist before liberation. Light industry has also made great progress. The proportion of total industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value has increased from 24.8% in 1939 to 69.9% in 1958. The total industrial output value in 1958 was equal to 8.86 times the highest pre-war level in 1939. The Bulgarian people have completed the socialist transformation of agriculture. The agricultural labor cooperatives born in the process of the socialist revolution in rural areas have proved to the broad masses of farmers the unparalleled superiority of the socialist collective economy over the capitalist individual economy. Bulgaria has made great achievements in increasing agricultural production and improving agricultural technology. During the Second Five-Year Plan alone, the total output of agricultural products increased by 25%. The output of many agricultural products has multiplied compared with the pre-war period. The number of tractors in the country has increased tenfold compared with the pre-war period. The irrigated area has increased nearly sixteen times compared with the pre-war period. The victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the great development of agriculture in recent years prove that a series of measures taken by the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government in agriculture are completely correct. Due to the victory of socialism in urban and rural areas, Bulgaria has changed from a backward agricultural country into a prosperous socialist country with developed industry and large-scale cooperative and mechanized agriculture. With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the material and cultural living standards of the working people have also been significantly improved, and science, culture, and education have flourished.

In June last year, the Bulgarian Communist Party convened its Seventh Congress on the basis of decisive victories in socialism and great achievements in the national economy. The convening of this congress was a major event in the modern life of the Bulgarian people, marking that Bulgaria's socialist construction has entered a new stage of development—the stage of building socialism and preparing conditions for a gradual transition to communism. The resolutions of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the new Five-Year Plan immediately became a new source of inspiration for the Bulgarian people. Victory messages of overfulfilling production tasks came like snowflakes from all over the country. After analyzing the favorable situation that emerged after the Party Congress, the Bulgarian Communist Party issued a new fighting call to the people of the whole country in November last year: strive to complete the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in three or four years. At the beginning of this year, it put forward inspiring grand targets for developing the national economy: compared with 1957, the total industrial output value will increase by about one time by 1962, and by about two to three times by 1965; the total agricultural output value will increase by nearly two times by 1962; the national income will increase by more than one time by 1962, and by two times by 1965. This year alone, the total industrial output and the total agricultural output will increase by 27.8% and 73.9% respectively compared with last year. Excited and encouraged by this magnificent program of socialist construction, the Bulgarian people have brought into play their high labor enthusiasm and revolutionary drive, and launched an unprecedented mass movement across the country. As a result, a vibrant and prosperous situation has emerged on the entire political and economic fronts in Bulgaria. Completing the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and successfully realizing the above-mentioned grand program will not only enable the Bulgarian people to achieve great victories in the cause of building socialism, but also make a significant contribution to the peaceful competition between the world socialist system and the world capitalist system.

The Chinese people hail the brilliant achievements of the fraternal Bulgarian people, express their admiration for their heroic spirit and bold actions, and firmly believe that with the correct leadership of the tested Bulgarian Communist Party, the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and the fraternal support and cooperation of other socialist countries, the highly politically conscious Bulgarian people will surely victoriously realize this historically significant grand program.

The Bulgarian people have always been loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, cherishing and defending the unbreakable friendship and great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In the struggle against modern revisionism, the Bulgarian people have demonstrated a high degree of Marxist-Leninist principled spirit and unwavering proletarian stance, thus making valuable contributions to consolidating the world socialist camp and the unity of the international communist movement.

Representing the Bulgarian people's love of peace, the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has steadfastly pursued a peaceful foreign policy for fifteen years, unswervingly striving to safeguard world peace, ease international tensions, strengthen international cooperation, and promote friendship among the peoples of all countries. The Bulgarian government resolutely opposes the aggression and war policies of US imperialism, fully supports all major peace initiatives of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and sympathizes with and supports the just struggles of the people of Asian, African and Latin American countries against colonialism and for national independence. These efforts made by the People's Republic of Bulgaria in international affairs have won the universal support of the people of socialist countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, greatly enhanced its international prestige, and made important contributions to consolidating world peace. In recent years, Bulgaria has played an increasingly important role in promoting the Balkan Peninsula region to become a region of peace and security and in establishing friendly and good-neighborly relations among the countries of this region. The Bulgarian government has repeatedly stated its hope that the Balkan Peninsula region will become a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and has repeatedly stated its willingness to sign collective or bilateral non-aggression and cooperation agreements with Balkan countries. Recently, the Bulgarian government formally proposed to the Greek government an important proposal to conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries. The Chinese government and the Chinese people express their full support for these major efforts and proposals of the Bulgarian government.

Comrades, friends, like the Bulgarian people, our great motherland has also made brilliant achievements on the road of socialist construction. Inspired by the Party's General Line, the people of our country launched a vigorous Great Leap Forward movement last year, rapidly changing the face of our country as being "poor and blank". The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was held not long ago, and the resolutions of great historical significance adopted at the meeting, have raised even higher the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, resolutely overcoming the right-leaning opportunist thinking of some cadres, and putting forward to the entire Party and the people of the country the great fighting task of basically completing the Second Five-Year Plan within two years. Now, the people of the whole country have resolutely responded to the great call of the Communist Party of China, pushing the movement to increase production and practice economy to a new climax. With full confidence and soaring enthusiasm, they are determined to greet the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with new labor achievements, and strive to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year. Imperialism and all reactionaries have always held an extremely hostile attitude towards the great achievements made by our socialist countries. Recently, they have frantically issued various kinds of clamors, attempting to shake the Chinese people's determination to accelerate socialist construction and undermine the international prestige of the People's Republic of China. However, facts will once again give them a merciless blow. All the shameless clamors of reactionaries at home and abroad are in vain, and they will inevitably suffer new failures; the Chinese people will surely achieve more brilliant victories in the Great Leap Forward in the cause of socialist construction!

The people of China and Bulgaria have established a fighting friendship in the revolutionary struggle. Georgy Dimitrov, an outstanding activist in the world communist movement and the great leader and teacher of the Bulgarian people, had boundless care and sympathy for the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. Whether during the War of Resistance Against Japan or the War of Liberation, Dimitrov's concern and support for the Chinese people encouraged the Chinese people's determination to fight and won the heartfelt love of the Chinese people. Even at that time, the deep friendship of the Bulgarian people was stirring in the hearts of the Chinese people. However, only after the people of the two countries have successively achieved liberation can the friendship between our two peoples blossom and bear fruit in fertile soil. The great Marxist-Leninist ideology and the common goal of striving for lasting world peace and the cause of communism have closely linked the peoples of our two countries together. The fraternal friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries, established on this basis, fully embody the new type of close relationship between socialist countries. Like the rising sun, it radiates brilliant light in the socialist construction of our two countries. The Chinese people will continue to dedicate all their strength to consolidating and developing the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples.

Comrades, friends, when the Bulgarian people across the country are jubilantly celebrating their own festival, we Chinese people can hardly restrain our inner excitement. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people, to warmly hail the great achievements of the Bulgarian people, and sincerely wish them new and greater victories in the struggle to build a prosperous and strong socialist motherland and promote world peace and human progress!

Long live the socialist People's Republic of Bulgaria and the hardworking and brave Bulgarian people!

Long live the unity of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people!

Long live world peace!

    中保人民友谊放射灿烂光芒
    薄一波副总理在北京庆祝保国庆大会上的讲话亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    明天是保加利亚社会主义革命的十五周年。我们首都各界人民以无限兴奋的心情在这里举行隆重的集会，庆祝这个伟大的节日。我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民向保加利亚共产党、保加利亚政府和保加利亚人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    保加利亚人民是具有光荣的革命传统的、英勇勤劳、热爱自由和和平的人民。保加利亚人民为了争取民族独立和解放，曾经进行了前仆后继的斗争。在第二次世界大战期间，保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，有力地展开了反对希特勒占领和法西斯独裁统治的英勇的武装斗争。1944年9月9日，保加利亚人民终于在苏联军队的直接帮助下，举行了武装起义，推翻了保皇法西斯统治，结束了法西斯德国的占领，取得了具有历史意义的光辉胜利。从此，保加利亚永远摆脱了法西斯统治，走上了民主和社会主义发展的道路，保加利亚人民有史以来第一次成为国家的主人。中国人民一向为保加利亚这一历史性胜利和保加利亚人民的新生而欢欣鼓舞。
    在解放后人民政权的年代中，勤劳勇敢的保加利亚人民在光荣的保加利亚共产党的领导下，又以全副精力和热情投身于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业。
    过去，在君主专制时代的保加利亚是一个经济落后的国家，劳动人民处于政治无权、生活贫困、文化落后的水深火热的境遇中。但是，在解放后的短短十五年中，保加利亚的面貌发生了根本的变化。黑暗、落后、贫困的保加利亚已经一去不复返了。在恢复了经济、巩固了政权以后，保加利亚人民在建设自己的新生活中取得了光辉灿烂的成就。由于保加利亚共产党坚定不移地执行社会主义工业化的方针的结果，社会主义工业获得了一日千里的发展。保加利亚已经建立起解放前所没有的冶金工业、化学工业、机器制造业、造船工业、电力工业等重工业部门。轻工业也取得了巨大的发展。工业总产值在整个工农业总产值中的比重已经从1939年的24.8％上升到1958年的69.9％。1958年的工业总产值等于战前最高水平的1939年工业总产值的八点八六倍。保加利亚人民已经完成了农业的社会主义改造。在农村社会主义革命的过程中诞生的农业劳动合作社，向广大农民证明了社会主义集体经济对于资本主义个体经济的无比优越性。保加利亚在增加农产品产量和提高农业技术方面取得了巨大的成就。单在第二个五年计划期间，农产品总产量就增加了25％。许多农产品产量同战前比较都有成倍的增长。全国拖拉机的台数已增为战前的十倍。灌溉面积比战前增加了近十六倍。农业社会主义改造的胜利和近年来农业的巨大发展证明，保加利亚共产党和政府在农业方面采取的一系列措施，是完全正确的。由于社会主义在城乡的胜利，保加利亚已经从一个落后的农业国变成了一个具有发达的工业和大规模合作化和机械化的农业的繁荣昌盛的社会主义国家了。随着工农业的迅速发展，劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平也有了显著的提高，科学、文化、教育事业获得了蓬勃的发展。
    去年6月间，在社会主义取得决定性胜利和国民经济取得巨大成就的基础上，保加利亚共产党召开了第七次代表大会。这次代表大会的召开是保加利亚人民现代生活中的一件大事，它标志着保加利亚社会主义建设事业进入了一个新的发展阶段——建成社会主义和为逐步向共产主义过渡准备条件的阶段。保共第七次代表大会的决议和新的五年计划立即成为保加利亚人民新的鼓舞力量。超额完成生产任务的胜利消息从全国各地雪片飞来。保加利亚共产党分析了党代表大会以后出现的有利形势，在去年11月间，向全国人民发出了新的战斗号召：争取在三、四年内提前完成第三个五年计划。今年年初又提出振奋人心的发展国民经济的宏伟指标：同1957年相比，工业总产值到1962年将增长一倍左右，而到1965年将增长约二至三倍；农业总产值到1962年将增长近两倍；国民收入到1962年将增长一倍多，而到1965年将增长两倍。单是今年工业总产量和农业总产量，就将比去年分别增长27.8％和73.9％。为这一宏伟的社会主义建设纲领所激动和鼓舞的保加利亚人民，发挥了高度的劳动热忱和革命干劲，在全国范围内掀起了一个声势空前浩大的全民运动，于是在保加利亚整个政治和经济战线上出现了一种生气蓬勃、欣欣向荣的局面。提前完成第三个五年计划和胜利实现上述的宏伟纲领，不但将使保加利亚人民在建设社会主义的事业中取得伟大的胜利，同时也将对世界社会主义体系同世界资本主义体系的和平竞赛作出重大的贡献。
    中国人民欢呼兄弟的保加利亚人民的光辉成就，对于他们这种英雄气概和豪迈的行动表示十分钦佩，同时坚信，有了久经考验的保加利亚共产党的正确领导，有了苏联的无私援助和其他社会主义国家兄弟般的支援和合作，具有高度政治觉悟的保加利亚人民一定会胜利地实现这一具有历史意义的宏伟纲领。
    保加利亚人民一向忠于无产阶级国际主义的原则，珍视和捍卫以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的友谊和伟大团结。保加利亚人民在反对现代修正主义的斗争中，表现了高度的马克思列宁主义的原则精神和坚定不移的无产阶级立场，从而对巩固世界社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，作出了宝贵的贡献。
    代表着保加利亚人民热爱和平意志的保加利亚人民共和国政府，十五年来坚定不移地执行着和平外交政策，始终不渝地为维护世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势、加强国际合作和各国人民之间的友谊而努力。保加利亚政府坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，全力支持苏联和其他社会主义国家的一切重大的和平倡议，同情和支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争。保加利亚人民共和国在国际事务中所作的这些努力，获得了社会主义国家的人民以及世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民的普遍支持，大大地提高了它的国际声誉，并且对巩固世界和平作出了重要的贡献。近几年来，保加利亚在促进巴尔干半岛地区成为和平安全地区以及建立这一地区各国人民的友好睦邻关系方面，起着愈来愈大的作用。保加利亚政府曾经一再表示，希望巴尔干半岛地区成为无原子武器区，并且多次声明，愿同巴尔干各国签订集体或双边的互不侵犯和合作协定。最近保加利亚政府又正式向希腊政府提出了缔结两国互不侵犯条约的重要建议。中国政府和中国人民对于保加利亚政府这些重大的努力和建议表示完全支持。
    同志们，朋友们，同保加利亚人民一样，我们伟大的祖国在社会主义建设的道路上也取得了辉煌的成就。我国人民在党的总路线的鼓舞下，去年掀起了轰轰烈烈的大跃进运动，迅速改变着我国“一穷二白”的面貌。不久以前举行的中国共产党第八届中央委员会第八次全体会议和会议所通过的具有重大历史意义的决议，更高地举起了总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光荣旗帜，坚决地克服了某些干部的右倾机会主义思想，向全党和全国人民提出了在两年内基本完成第二个五年计划的伟大战斗任务。现在，全国人民坚决响应了中国共产党的伟大号召，把增产节约运动推向新的高潮。他们信心百倍、干劲冲天，决心以新的劳动成绩来迎接伟大的中华人民共和国十周年国庆，为在今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗。帝国主义和一切反动派对于我们社会主义国家所取得的伟大成就一贯抱着极端仇视的态度。最近，他们疯狂地发出了各种各样的叫嚣，企图动摇中国人民加速建设社会主义的决心，破坏中华人民共和国的国际威信。但是，事实将再一次给他们以无情的打击。国内外反动派的一切无耻叫嚣都是枉费心机，而且必将遭到新的失败；中国人民在社会主义建设事业的大跃进中一定会取得更加辉煌的胜利！
    中保两国人民在革命斗争中建立了战斗的友谊。世界共产主义运动的杰出活动家、保加利亚人民的伟大领袖和导师格奥尔基·季米特洛夫对于中国人民的革命斗争，曾经寄予无限的关怀和同情。无论在抗日战争时期或者解放战争时期，季米特洛夫对中国人民的关怀和支持都鼓舞了中国人民的斗争决心，赢得了中国人民的衷心爱戴。还在那个时候，在中国人民的心目中就激荡着对保加利亚人民的深厚友情。然而，只是在两国人民相继获得解放之后，我们两国人民的友谊，才能在肥沃的土壤上开花结果。伟大的马克思列宁主义思想和为世界持久和平和共产主义事业奋斗的共同目标，把我们两国人民紧紧地联系在一起。我们两国建立在这种基础上的兄弟友谊和互助合作，完全体现了社会主义国家间亲密无间的新型关系。十年来，我们两国在政治、经济、文化各方面的互助和合作，充分显示了这种新型关系的伟大生命力。它像初升的太阳一样，在我们两国的社会主义建设事业中放射着灿烂的光芒。我们中国人民将继续为巩固和发展我们两国人民牢不可破的友谊而献出一切力量。
    同志们，朋友们，当保加利亚全国人民举国欢腾地庆祝自己节日的时候，我们中国人民也难以抑制内心的激动，请允许我代表中国人民热烈欢呼保加利亚人民的伟大成就，衷心地预祝他们在建设繁荣富强的社会主义祖国和促进世界和平和人类进步事业的斗争中，取得新的更大的胜利！
    社会主义的保加利亚人民共和国和勤劳勇敢的保加利亚人民万岁！
    以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营的团结万岁！
    中保两国人民牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
