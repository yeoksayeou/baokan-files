Comrades and friends,

    The celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China now begins. Let us express our sincerest gratitude and warmest welcome to our dear guests who have come from afar to participate in our National Day celebration, to the leading comrades of our great ally the Soviet Union and the socialist countries, to the representative comrades of the Communist Parties of various countries, and to friends from all over the world! (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause)

    Ten years ago, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups in our country achieved a great victory in the people's democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and established the People's Republic of China. This opened up a new socialist era in Chinese history. (Enthusiastic applause)

    In the past ten years, we have rapidly achieved a great victory in the socialist revolution, thoroughly liberating the social productive forces of our country. Our socialist construction is developing rapidly. Our industrial production has increased more than tenfold in ten years, and agricultural production has also increased by one and a half times. The living standards of our people have generally improved. Our education, culture, science, and health undertakings are also flourishing. (Enthusiastic applause)

    All our achievements have been created by the hard work of the broad masses of the people. The Great Hall of the People, where we are holding this celebration, is a powerful testament to the great creative power of the people. Let us take this opportunity to express our highest respect to the more than 14,000 construction workers and engineering technicians who built this hall in ten months, and to the working people of the whole country who have achieved great achievements in the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement under the glorious banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction. (Stormy applause)

    In the past ten years, we have received fraternal assistance from the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and we have received sympathy and support from the proletariat of all countries, all peace-loving countries and peoples. We sincerely thank our international friends for their great assistance and support. (Enthusiastic applause)

    Ten years is a short time. The achievements we have made are still small in relation to the needs of the country and the people, and our leap forward in construction is only just beginning. We still have very great tasks ahead of us. In order to accomplish such great tasks, we must constantly consolidate and strengthen the great unity of the Chinese people and the great unity of the people of the world. (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause)

    The great unity of the Chinese people is the fundamental condition for our victory in the cause of revolution and construction. Under the banner of socialism, the people of all nationalities in our country are closely united in the big family of the motherland. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals in our country have formed flesh-and-blood ties in the long struggle, and are united with all patriotic people. As long as the 650 million Chinese people are more closely united around the Chinese Communist Party, work together with one heart and one mind, and struggle heroically, we will surely be able to overcome any difficulties, and we will surely be able to achieve our great goals. (Enthusiastic applause)

    The great unity of the people of the world is the fundamental condition for the world to obtain peace and progress, and it is also the international condition for the victory of our socialist cause. We will always unite with the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp. We will always unite with the working people of all countries, the democratic and progressive forces of all countries, and the Communist Parties of all countries. We will always unite with all the people and governments in the world who advocate maintaining peace, striving for national independence, and opposing policies of aggression and war. (Enthusiastic applause)

    We believe that, in order to maintain peace, all countries with different social systems should practice peaceful coexistence and engage in peaceful competition on the basis of the Five Principles. At the same time, in order to maintain peace, aggression must be stopped. The United States still occupies our territory of Taiwan, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. The Chinese people must liberate their territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu. (Prolonged applause)

    The socialist camp countries, headed by the Soviet Union, have consistently dedicated themselves to easing international tensions and striving for lasting world peace. Thanks to the efforts of peace-loving governments and people all over the world, the demand for peace is deepening into the hearts of people in all countries day by day. The 650 million people of our country have consistently stood at the forefront of maintaining Asian peace and world peace in the past ten years, and will continue to work hand in hand with all peace forces in the world for the cause of peace and for the cause of mutual friendship among the people of all countries. (Stormy applause)

    The world situation is favorable to the people who maintain peace, strive for independence, and progress; it is favorable to the advance of the socialist countries' peaceful construction and to the advance of the Chinese people's peaceful construction.

    Let our people of all nationalities, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, and under the glorious light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, advance courageously and go from victory to greater victory! (Stormy applause)

    Long live the great unity of the Chinese people! (Stormy applause)

    Long live the great unity of the people of the world! (Enthusiastic applause)

    Long live the People's Republic of China! (Prolonged and enthusiastic applause)

    在中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝大会上
    刘少奇主席的开幕词亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    中华人民共和国成立十周年庆祝大会现在开始了。让我们向远道前来参加我们国庆典礼的亲爱的来宾们，向我们伟大盟邦苏联和社会主义各国的领导同志们，向各国共产党的代表同志们，向来自世界各国的朋友们，表示最诚挚的感谢和最热烈的欢迎。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
    十年前，我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民民主革命的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。这就开辟了中国历史的社会主义新时代。（热烈鼓掌）
    十年来，我们迅速地取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利，使我国社会生产力得到了彻底的解放。我国的社会主义建设事业，正在高速度地向前发展。我们的工业生产在十年间增长了十倍以上，农业生产也增长了一倍半。我国人民生活水平普遍地有了提高。我们的教育、文化、科学、卫生事业，也在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。（热烈鼓掌）
    我们的一切成就都是广大人民的辛勤劳动所创造的。我们在这里举行庆祝大会的人民大会堂，就是人民群众的伟大创造力量的有力证明之一。让我们借这个机会，向在十个月时间内建成这座大会堂的一万四千多名建筑工人和工程技术人员，向高举着党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉旗帜，在大跃进和人民公社运动中取得伟大成就的全国劳动人民，表示崇高的敬意。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在过去的十年间，我们得到了伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家的兄弟般的援助，得到了世界各国无产阶级、一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。我们衷心地感谢国际朋友们的伟大的援助和支持。（热烈鼓掌）
    十年是一个短时间。我们所得的成就对于国家和人民的需要来说还很小，我们在建设中的跃进还只是开始。在我们的面前，还有非常巨大的任务。为了完成这样巨大的任务，我们必须不断地巩固和加强中国人民的大团结和世界人民的大团结。（长时间热烈鼓掌）
    中国人民的大团结，是我们在革命和建设事业中取得胜利的根本条件。在社会主义的旗帜下，我国各民族的人民亲密地团结在祖国的大家庭里。我国的广大工人、农民和革命知识分子，在长期的斗争中结成了血肉的联系，并且团结着一切爱国的人民。只要六亿五千万中国人民更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，同心同德，英勇奋斗，我们一定能够克服任何困难，我们一定能够达到我们的伟大目标。（热烈鼓掌）
    世界人民的大团结是世界获得和平和进步的根本条件，也是我国社会主义事业取得胜利的国际条件。我们将永远同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家团结在一起。我们将永远同各国劳动人民、各国民主进步力量和各国共产党团结在一起。我们将永远同全世界一切主张维护和平、争取民族独立、反对侵略政策和战争政策的人民和政府团结在一起。（热烈鼓掌）
    我们认为，为了维护和平，一切社会制度不同的国家都应当本着五项原则实行和平共处，进行和平竞赛。同时，为了维护和平，必须制止侵略。美国到现在还侵占着我国的领土台湾，这是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。中国人民一定要解放自己的领土台湾、澎湖和金门、马祖。（长时间的鼓掌）
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，一贯地致力于缓和国际紧张局势和争取世界持久和平。由于全世界爱好和平的政府和人民的努力，和平的要求正在一天天深入各国的人心。我国的六亿五千万人民在过去十年中一贯站在维护亚洲和平和世界和平的最前线，在今后也将继续为和平事业，为各国人民互相友好的事业，同全世界一切和平力量携手奋斗。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    世界的形势是有利于维护和平、争取独立和进步的人民的，是有利于社会主义各国和平建设事业的前进、有利于中国人民和平建设事业的前进的。
    让我们全国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在马克思列宁主义的战无不胜的旗帜下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，奋勇前进，从胜利走向更大的胜利！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    中国人民大团结万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    世界人民大团结万岁！（热烈鼓掌）
    中华人民共和国万岁！（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
