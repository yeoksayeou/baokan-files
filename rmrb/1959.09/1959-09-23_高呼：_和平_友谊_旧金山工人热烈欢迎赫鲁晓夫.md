Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd, dispatch from San Francisco by TASS: The press group accompanying the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union issued a communiqué stating that after the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, arrived in San Francisco on the evening of September 20th, he was invited that evening to meet with American labor union leaders. Many well-known activists in the American labor movement were present.

The communiqué stated, "Everyone frankly exchanged views on many important international situation issues and certain issues of the labor union movement. At the beginning of the discussion, Carey and Reuther said that the American labor union leaders were very happy to have the opportunity to discuss with the head of the Soviet government, and this frank conversation may have a beneficial effect." Carey said, "The main issue is how to maintain peace."

The discussion lasted for more than three hours, and sometimes it was very pointed. Khrushchev answered many questions. He pointed out that until now, there had been no contact between Soviet and American labor unions. He said, "We stand on different positions. It seems impossible for you to understand us all at once, and we may not know everything about you. Let us not make the relationship tense. Although we have differences on many issues, we have a common cause, and we should unite our strength for this cause, which is the struggle for peace."

American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) Vice President Carey thanked Khrushchev for the meeting at the end of the discussion. He suggested a toast to the distinguished guest. He said, "Thank you for generously spending your precious time to discuss with us, and wish you a good journey. Let us cooperate to benefit peace and benefit humanity."

"What is surprising is that Reuther, in a press conference held immediately after the meeting, seriously distorted Khrushchev's opinions on some important issues when talking about the discussion, and attributed many words that Khrushchev did not say to him."

The communiqué stated, "At the invitation of Bridges, President of the Pacific Coast Longshoremen's Union, Khrushchev visited the union's headquarters. He was warmly welcomed by the workers gathered there. In talking with Khrushchev, the workers talked about their working conditions. They asked to convey their respects to the Soviet workers and expressed their will to strive for peace. Khrushchev made a brief speech to everyone, saying: "Please allow me to address you with the customary term used among our Soviet workers—comrades! (Stormy applause. Friendly shouts.) I sincerely thank Bridges, the President of your union, for his kind invitation. During my stay in the United States, I have met with ordinary Americans and your activists. I have the impression that Americans want peace. We welcome this desire because we ourselves also want lasting peace! (Stormy applause. Everyone shouted in Russian and English: Peace! Peace!) Dear friends, thank you for your hospitality (Stormy applause). I represent the Soviet workers to greet you, and I will convey your greetings to them after I return home (Stormy applause). I hope you can get what the workers hope to get. What do the workers want? (Shouts: "Peace!") Yes, peace. There must be peace. In addition, I hope you always have work to do and have high wages (Stormy applause). Goodbye, friends!" (Stormy applause. Shouts: "Peace!" "Friendship!" "Goodbye, Khrushchev!")"

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd, dispatch from San Francisco by TASS: San Francisco Mayor George Christopher, the World Affairs Council of Northern California, and the Commonwealth Club hosted a banquet for the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, on the evening of the 21st. About two thousand guests gathered in the hall of the Palace Hotel—business people, scientists, cultural figures, and social celebrities from San Francisco and California.

When the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, appeared in the hall, people applauded warmly to welcome him.

Rockwell, Chairman of the World Affairs Council of Northern California, San Francisco Mayor Christopher, California Governor Brown, and U.S. President's Personal Representative Lodge all spoke at the banquet.

The speakers emphasized the special importance of the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, and said that the residents of San Francisco were delighted by the presence of the Soviet distinguished guest.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a long speech in reply. He especially emphasized that the people of the Soviet Union and the United States must establish peaceful and friendly relations. Khrushchev said that he had a strong impression of San Francisco and the San Francisco citizens who warmly received him. Khrushchev's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause and praise from the audience.

At the end of the banquet, someone presented Khrushchev with a gift—the gavel used by the person presiding over the meeting, as a souvenir of his visit to San Francisco. When receiving the gift, Khrushchev pointed out that after the signing of the Soviet-American Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Treaty of Complete Disarmament, he hoped to use this gavel to strike a symbolic blow. He hoped that his talks with President Eisenhower would help ensure peace and friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the United States.

    高呼：“和平”“友谊”
    旧金山工人热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社旧金山22日讯：苏联部长会议主席随行新闻组发表公报说，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫9月20日晚间到达旧金山后，在当晚应邀同美国工会领袖会晤。到场的有美国许多著名工会运动活动家。
    公报说，“大家坦率地就许多重要的国际局势问题和工会运动的某些问题交换了意见。在座谈开始时，凯雷和路德说，美国工会领袖很高兴能够有机会同苏联政府首脑座谈，这次坦率的谈话可能起有益的作用。凯雷说，“主要的问题是如何维护和平的问题。”
    座谈进行了三个多小时，有时谈得很尖锐，赫鲁晓夫回答了许多问题。他指出，直到现在，苏联工会和美国工会之间还没有接触，他说，“我们站在不同的立场。你们看来不可能一下子理解我们，我们也可能不知道你们的一切。让我们不要把关系搞得紧张起来。尽管在许多问题上我们是有分歧的，但我们有一个共同的事业，我们应当为这个事业团结我们的力量，这个事业就是争取和平的斗争。”
    美国劳联—产联副主席凯雷在座谈的最后感谢赫鲁晓夫这次会晤。他建议为贵宾干杯。他说，“谢谢你慷慨花费宝贵的时间同我们座谈，祝你一路顺风。让我们合作共同来造福和平，造福人类。”
    “值得惊奇的是，路德在会晤后立即举行的记者招待会上谈到关于这次座谈时，竟严重地歪曲了赫鲁晓夫在一些重要问题上表示的意见，并且把许多赫鲁晓夫并没有说过的话加在他的头上。”
    公报说，“赫鲁晓夫应太平洋海岸码头工人工会主席布里奇斯的邀请，参观了这个工会的总部。他受到了聚集在那里的工人们的衷心欢迎。工人们在同赫鲁晓夫谈话时谈到了自己的劳动条件，他们请求向苏联工人转达他们的敬意，并且表达了自己争取和平的意志。赫鲁晓夫向大家作简短的致词，他说：“请允许我用我们苏联工人互相间惯用的称呼来称呼你们——同志们！（暴风雨般的掌声。友好的呼声。）我衷心感谢你们工会的主席布里奇斯的盛意邀请。我在美国逗留期间曾经同普通美国人和你们的活动家会晤。我有这样一个印象：美国人是希望和平的。我们欢迎这种愿望，因为我们自己也希望巩固的和平！（暴风雨般的掌声。大家用俄语和英语高喊：和平！和平！）亲爱的朋友们，谢谢你们的盛情招待（暴风雨般的掌声）。我代表苏联工人向你们问候，而在回国后也要把你们的问候转达给他们（暴风雨般的掌声）。我希望你们能获得工人希望获得的东西。工人希望什么呢？（喊声：“和平！”）对，和平。必须和平。此外，我希望你们一直有工可做，有很高的工资（暴风雨般的掌声）。再见，朋友们！”（暴风雨般的掌声。高呼：“和平！”“友谊！”“再见，赫鲁晓夫！”。）”
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社旧金山21日讯：旧金山市长乔治·克里斯托弗、北加利福尼亚世界事务委员会以及联邦俱乐部在21日晚设宴招待苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。皇宫饭店的大厅里聚集了约两千名客人——旧金山和加利福尼亚州的实业界人士、科学家、文化活动家及社会名流等。
    当苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在大厅出现时，人们热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    北加利福尼亚世界事务委员会主席罗克韦耳、旧金山市长克里斯托弗、加利福尼亚州州长布朗和美国总统私人代表洛奇都在宴会上讲了话。
    发言的人们着重指出了赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔互相访问的特殊重要意义，并且说，旧金山的居民为苏联贵宾的光临而感到高兴。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫发表了长篇答谢演说。他特别强调说，苏美两国人民必须建立和平友好关系。赫鲁晓夫说，他对旧金山以及热情接待他的旧金山市民有着强烈的印象。赫鲁晓夫的演说一再被听众的掌声和赞扬声打断。
    在宴会结束的时候，有人向赫鲁晓夫献礼——主持会议的人使用的小锤，作为他访问旧金山的纪念。赫鲁晓夫在受礼时指出，在苏美友好和互不侵犯条约、全面裁军条约签订以后，他希望用这把小锤作一象征性的敲击。他希望，他和艾森豪威尔总统的会谈将有助于保障苏美两国人民的和平和友谊。
