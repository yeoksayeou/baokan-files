Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: The track and field competition of the First National Games reached its climax today, with twelve athletes breaking five national records.

Premier Zhou Enlai watched the track and field competition this afternoon and spoke cordially with athletes and coaches on the field.

The record-breaking achievements today were: Liu Zheng, a competitor from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, clocked 10.9 seconds in the women's 80-meter hurdles semi-final, creating the third-best result in the world this year (the world record is 10.6 seconds); in the men's 400-meter final, Li Zhonglin from Shandong and Xuan Yaolun, a nineteen-year-old from Shanghai, broke the "oldest" national record in Chinese track and field, set by Liu Jingren in August 1955 with 49.1 seconds, achieving 48.9 seconds and 49.0 seconds respectively; in the men's 1500-meter final, the top six finishers all broke the national record of 3 minutes 59.8 seconds, and the seventh-place finisher also equaled the national record; the top two finishers in the men's 200-meter low hurdles final both broke the national record. Jiang Yumin, a female athlete from Zhejiang, broke the national record of 24.8 seconds with a time of 24.5 seconds in the women's 200-meter preliminary round.

So far, since the start of the National Games track and field competition a week ago, twenty-two athletes have broken twelve national records.

Today's men's high jump final was conducted at an unprecedentedly high level in the history of Chinese track and field. The top seven finishers all reached or exceeded 1.90 meters (Wu Bixian's pre-liberation national record, set in 1936, was only 1.871 meters). Duan Qiyan, a twenty-one-year-old athlete from Beijing, won the championship with a jump of 1.97 meters, surpassing his own best performance this year of 1.95 meters. Chen Zhongyuan, a twenty-one-year-old student from Nanjing First Medical College, came in second with a jump of 1.93 meters. Shi Hongfan, an eighteen-year-old athlete from Shandong who recently jumped over 2.02 meters, only cleared 1.93 meters due to nervousness, placing third. Kang Jubei, a twenty-year-old athlete from Guangdong, came in fourth, also jumping 1.93 meters. Li Dapei, a veteran from Jiangxi, came in fifth with 1.90 meters. National record holder Ma Xianglong from Yunnan was eliminated in yesterday's high jump "qualifying round" (qualifying standard was 1.90 meters) due to a knee injury.

The weather in Beijing was particularly good today, and good news kept coming from the Beijing Workers' Stadium, with waves of applause from the audience. Liu Zheng, a competitor from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, equaled the national record held by Wen Yunzhen from Guangxi with a time of 11 seconds in the women's 80-meter hurdles preliminary round. After a break of more than an hour, she created an excellent result of 10.9 seconds in the semi-final, becoming the first person in China to break through the 11-second "barrier" in the women's 80-meter hurdles.

The men's 400-meter final was very exciting. Xuan Yaolun, who is 1.84 meters tall and has a long stride, had been leading all the way. Li Zhonglin followed closely, and with the last 100 meters remaining, the two were almost side by side. The audience cheered them on with shouts of "Jiayou!" In the end, Li Zhonglin crossed the finish line first with a shoulder's advantage, and Xuan Yaolun came in second. The audience's noise had just subsided when the loudspeaker announced the good news that they had both broken the national record.

The men's 1500-meter final was even more intense than yesterday's preliminary round. In the end, the "battle" concluded with six athletes breaking the national record and one athlete equaling the national record. Li Henian, a competitor from Hebei who won the championship, only overtook Yin Fengwu, a competitor from Jilin who had been leading all the way and had beaten him in the preliminary round, in the last hundred meters, and reached the finish line first with a time of 3 minutes 55.7 seconds. Yin Fengwu came in second with 3 minutes 57.5 seconds. Wang Zhixiang from Beijing came in third with 3 minutes 58.2 seconds. The following were Yitaotege from Inner Mongolia, 3 minutes 58.8 seconds; Wang Weipei from Fujian, 3 minutes 59.3 seconds; Bao Shusen from Heilongjiang, 3 minutes 59.5 seconds. They all broke the national record of 3 minutes 59.8 seconds, and Liu Xingtai from Liaoning, who finished seventh, equaled the national record. It is the first time we have seen so many athletes finish the 1500 meters in under four minutes in China.

Zhou Yuguang, a competitor from Guangdong, won the men's 110-meter hurdles final the day before yesterday, and today he also won the men's 200-meter low hurdles final, and together with Liang Shiqiang from Beijing, who came in second, broke the national record of 24.9 seconds with a time of 24.5 seconds.

In the men's javelin final held today, Ma Facheng, a competitor from Henan, won all his opponents with his last throw, winning the championship with a score of 67.78 meters. (Attached picture)

    田径比赛一浪高过一浪
    昨日十二名运动员打破五项全国纪录
    男子1500米决赛“大面积丰收”七人成绩在四分以内
    据新华社19日讯　第一届全国运动会的田径比赛今天进入高潮，有十二名运动员打破了五项全国纪录。
    周恩来总理观看了今天下午的田径比赛，并且到运动场上同运动员和教练员们亲切谈话。
    今天破纪录的情况是：内蒙古自治区选手刘正在女子八十米低栏复赛中，创造了十秒九的今年以来的世界上第三个最好成绩（这项世界纪录是十秒六）；在男子四百米决赛中，山东选手李忠林和上海十九岁的宣耀伦分别以四十八秒九和四十九秒的成绩，打破了我国田径全国纪录中最“老”的、刘敬仁在1955年8月创造的四十九秒一的全国纪录；在男子一千五百米决赛中，前六名的成绩都打破了三分五十九秒八的全国纪录，第七名的成绩也平了全国纪录；男子二百米低栏决赛前两名的成绩都打破了全国纪录。浙江女选手姜玉民在女子二百米预赛中，以二十四秒五的成绩打破了二十四秒八的全国纪录。
    至此，全运会田径赛开始举行一个星期以来，已有二十二名运动员打破了十二项全国纪录。
    今天的男子跳高决赛，是在我国田径史上空前高的水平上进行的，前七名的成绩都达到或超过了一米九十（吴必显在1936年创造的解放前的全国纪录只有一米八十七点一）。获得冠军的是北京二十一岁的选手段其炎，成绩一米九十七，超过了他自己今年的最高成绩——一米九十五。第二名是南京第一医学院二十一岁的学生陈钟元，成绩一米九十三。不久前曾跳过两米零二的山东十八岁的选手史鸿范由于紧张，只跳过一米九十三，名列第三。广东二十岁的选手康驹培第四，也跳过了一米九十三。第五名是江西老将李大培，一米九十。全国纪录保持者、云南马翔龙因膝受伤，在昨天举行跳高“及格赛”时（及格标准一米九十）被淘汰。
    今天北京天气特别好，北京工人体育场捷报频传，观众掌声一阵接着一阵。内蒙古自治区选手刘正在女子八十米低栏预赛中，就以十一秒的成绩平了广西选手文蕴珍保持的全国纪录。休息一个多小时后，在复赛中她又创造了十秒九的优异成绩，成为我国女子八十米低栏成绩突破十一秒“大关”的第一人。
    男子四百米决赛十分精采，身高一米八十四、步伐长大的宣耀伦原来一直领先，李忠林紧随不舍，还剩最后一百米时两人几乎是并肩前进，观众齐声呐喊为他们“加油”，最后李忠林以一肩之差的优势首先冲过终点线，宣耀伦第二。观众喧闹声刚刚平静，扩音器中就传出了他们双双打破全国纪录的喜讯。
    男子一千五百米决赛比昨天预赛时争夺得更为激烈，最后是以六名选手打破全国纪录、一名选手平全国纪录来结束“战斗”的。获得冠军的河北选手李贺年，是在最后一百多米处才赶过原来一直领先的、在预赛时曾赢过他的吉林选手殷凤武，第一个到达终点，成绩三分五十五秒七。殷凤武第二，三分五十七秒五。北京王致祥第三，三分五十八秒二。以下是内蒙古伊套特格，三分五十八秒八；福建王为培，三分五十九秒三；黑龙江包树森，三分五十九秒五，他们都打破三分五十九秒八的全国纪录，第七名辽宁刘兴太平全国纪录。有这么多选手一千五百米成绩在四分钟以内，这在我国还是第一次看到。
    广东选手周裕光继前天夺得男子一百一十米高栏决赛的冠军后，今天又取得了二百米低栏决赛的冠军，并且同第二名、北京的梁仕强同以二十四秒五的成绩打破二十四秒九的全国纪录。
    在今天举行的男子标枪的决赛中，河南选手马法成在最后一次投掷时赢了所有的对手，以六十七米七八的成绩获得冠军。（附图片）
