    Revolutionary Drive and "Petty-Bourgeois Frenzy"
    Xu Feiguang

    Regarding the same thing, standing on different positions and adopting different attitudes will lead to completely different conclusions.

    Different people have completely different views on the revolutionary drive shown by the broad masses of the people in our country in the great mass movements since 1958. The broad masses of the people adopt a positive attitude towards this drive. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his article "Introducing a Cooperative," enthusiastically praised this revolutionary drive of the masses. He said: "Apart from the leadership of the Party, the 600 million population is a decisive factor. With more people, there are more discussions, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive. Never have we seen the masses of the people so spirited, high in morale, and full of vigor." The inevitable conclusion drawn from this view is to cherish the revolutionary drive of the masses and continue to promote the revolutionary drive of the masses. Some people who originally looked down on the working people and mass movements could not help but examine their old views and re-evaluate the working people after this great revolutionary movement. They are naturally changing their minds in the face of unprecedented miracles. However, some right-leaning opportunists, who were frightened by the vigorous revolutionary movement of the masses, stubbornly clung to that set of bourgeois views, even saying that our mass movement is a "petty-bourgeois frenzy." The inevitable conclusion drawn from this is that the revolutionary drive of hundreds of millions of people in our country is a manifestation of "petty-bourgeois fanaticism." That being the case, a bucket of cold water should be poured on this drive.

    Equating the tremendous revolutionary drive shown by hundreds of millions of people with petty-bourgeois frenzy is a black-and-white slander against the 600 million Chinese people and also a slander against the Party Central Committee's general line for socialist construction. Because from this point of view, we can only conclude that the general line is "wrong" and the drive of the working people is "blind."

    In fact, the revolutionary drive of the working people in our country is by no means a manifestation of petty-bourgeois fanaticism. The revolutionary drive of the working people we are talking about refers first and foremost to the unprecedentedly high political enthusiasm shown by hundreds of millions of working people in the Great Leap Forward, and the revolutionary courage to despise all difficulties and the heroic spirit of hard struggle generated on this basis. This drive is an important driving force for hundreds of millions of working people to impact things and build a new society. Last year alone, the increase in the output of grain and cotton exceeded the total increase in the five years of the First Five-Year Plan; the growth rate of crude steel production also greatly exceeded the annual increase of 31.7% in steel production during the First Five-Year Plan period. Can it be imagined that such a huge task, or even a task smaller than this, could be accomplished without revolutionary drive? Obviously, that is absolutely impossible. We relied on this drive to achieve victory in the struggle to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; similarly, in completing the cause of socialist revolution and construction, we need this revolutionary drive even more. Stalin, in his book "Foundations of Leninism," gave a very good explanation of revolutionary drive. He said: "Russian revolutionary daring is a remedy for eliminating inertia, conservatism, backwardness, stagnation of thought, and blind obedience to old traditions. Russian revolutionary daring is an inspiring force that can awaken thought, promote progress, destroy the old, and open up the future. Without this revolutionary daring, one cannot move forward even one step." Here, the "revolutionary daring" that Stalin said is what we call revolutionary drive. Obviously, without revolutionary drive, there would be no revolutionary movement, no bold creation, and no leap forward. This should be common sense for us. Therefore, mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people, going all out, and striving for the top is a very important component of the general line of socialist construction put forward by the Party Central Committee. If we abolish going all out and striving for the top, it is equivalent to castrating the essence of the general line, which is equivalent to abolishing the general line.

    Petty-bourgeois frenzy is completely different from our revolutionary drive. If revolutionary drive is a youthful vitality and a source of revolutionary strength, then petty-bourgeois frenzy is a morbid heat. This heat will not only not promote socialist construction, but will also harm socialist construction. Lenin, in his book "Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder," made an extremely profound analysis of petty-bourgeois frenzy. He said: "The small proprietor, the small master... who under capitalism is constantly oppressed and whose life is often suddenly worsened, leading to ruin, easily falls into extreme revolutionary fervor, but lacks perseverance, organization, discipline, and steadfastness." He also said: "Vacillation caused by various changes in circumstances, liking to go to extremes, being flashy and unrealistic, and taking advantage of opportunities are the characteristics of petty-bourgeois thought on the bad side. This is the ideological reflection of the unstable economic position of the petty bourgeoisie." (Resolution of the Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Historical Issues) Here, Lenin clearly revealed the root causes, main manifestations, and final destination of petty-bourgeois frenzy.

    As long as we compare Lenin's analysis of petty-bourgeois frenzy with the revolutionary drive of the broad masses of the people in reality, we can see that the two are completely different, even mutually opposed.

    The generation of petty-bourgeois frenzy is determined by the class status of the petty bourgeoisie. "Many representatives of petty-bourgeois revolutionaries hope for an immediate victory of the revolution in order to fundamentally change their current position; therefore, they lack patience for the long-term efforts of the revolution, and they have great interest in 'leftist' revolutionary words and slogans." "Swinging left and right, liking to go to extremes, being flashy and unrealistic, and taking advantage of opportunities due to changes in various circumstances are characteristics of petty-bourgeois thought on the bad side. This is the ideological reflection of the unstable economic position of the petty bourgeoisie." (Resolution of the Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Historical Issues) The revolutionary drive of the masses is a force generated under the guidance of the Party and under the inspiration of the general line in order to get rid of the poor and blank state of our country and build a great socialist country.

    Petty-bourgeois frenzy, under normal circumstances, is only the action of a small group of people who are divorced from the masses. The Russian Populists were such people. Relying on temporary revolutionary enthusiasm, they relied on a few people to engage in assassinations, terror, and desperate activities. Not to mention mobilizing hundreds of millions of people, they could not even mobilize hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of people. However, our mass movement is a great movement involving 600 million people. Such a large-scale revolutionary movement and the revolutionary drive shown by the working people in the movement cannot be inspired by some kind of petty-bourgeois frenzy.

    Petty-bourgeois frenzy is often only a temporary frenzy. It is not only "unstable and flashy," but also "quickly turns into obedience, depression, indulgence in fantasy." They are sometimes very "left," but they often turn and fall into the quagmire of right-leaning opportunism. Therefore, this frenzy is at most a flash in the pan and will quickly disappear. However, the revolutionary drive of the broad masses of the people is a force that is booming and lasting. With the "momentum of overturning mountains and overwhelming seas, and the force of thunder," it goes forward bravely, indomitable in the face of any difficulties and obstacles, and shows great revolutionary tenacity. It is forever irreconcilable with the bourgeois ideology of right-leaning opportunism, and wages a resolute struggle with it. At the same time, the more thoroughly opportunism is overcome, the more fully revolutionary drive will be boosted. It is precisely because of this that we can strive for continued leaps forward in 1959 on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

    In short, petty-bourgeois frenzy, as Lenin said in the same book, "in any major issue, it departs from the conditions and requirements of the proletariat's persistent class struggle." The revolutionary drive of the broad masses of the people, on the contrary, is not blindly rushing, but fully exerting the subjective initiative of people on the basis of scientific analysis and respect for objective regularity. It fully takes into account the "conditions and requirements of the proletariat's persistent struggle" in any major issue. Petty-bourgeois frenzy is always a tree without roots, only blooming but not bearing fruit, and always ends in failure or surrender; and our mass revolutionary drive has yielded unprecedentedly rich fruits in just one year.

    For the above reasons, our Party has always resolutely opposed petty-bourgeois frenzy and resolutely protected the revolutionary drive of the masses; it adopts a method of patiently helping the masses with certain shortcomings that occur in the revolutionary movement, and never pours cold water on them. Right-leaning opportunists, under the guise of "opposing petty-bourgeois frenzy," oppose the mass movement and pour cold water on the revolutionary drive of the masses, which precisely proves that they are standing on the bourgeois position to view the mass movement and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, thus playing an extremely disgraceful role. Facts have proved that the revolutionary drive of hundreds of millions of people is by no means a "petty-bourgeois frenzy." The label of "petty-bourgeois frenzy" put on by right-leaning opportunists does not mean that they are genuinely interested in overcoming "petty-bourgeois frenzy." "The drunkard's intention is not in the wine." Their real purpose is to abolish the Party's general line and abolish the revolutionary mass movement. Therefore, we must recognize their true purpose, unswervingly implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results put forward by the Party Central Committee, and use this to answer the rampant attacks of domestic and foreign reactionaries and domestic right-leaning opportunists.

    革命的干劲和“小资产阶级的狂热”
    徐非光
    对于同样一件事，站在不同的立场，采取不同的态度，就会得出完全不同的结论。
    对于1958年以来我国广大劳动人民在伟大的群众运动中所表现出的革命干劲，不同的人就有完全不同的看法。广大的劳动人民对这种干劲，是采取肯定的态度。毛泽东同志就曾在“介绍一个合作社”一文中，满腔热情地赞扬了群众的这种革命干劲。他说：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。从来也没有看见人民群众像现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”从这种看法中得出的必然结论，就是要爱护群众的革命干劲，继续发扬群众的革命干劲。有些原来看不起劳动人民和群众运动的人，经过了这场伟大的革命运动，也不能不审查自己的旧观点，重新估量劳动人民。他们正在史无前例的奇迹面前改换脑筋，这是自然而然的事。但是，有一些被群众的轰轰烈烈的革命运动吓昏了的右倾机会主义分子，却继续顽固地抱住那一套资产阶级观点不放，竟说我们的群众运动是一种“小资产阶级的狂热运动”。从这里得出的必然结论就是，我国亿万人民的革命干劲乃是一种“小资产阶级的狂热性”的表现。既然如此，那就应当向这股干劲大泼冷水了。
    把亿万人表现出来的巨大革命干劲与小资产阶级的狂热相提并论，这是对六亿中国人民的一种颠倒黑白的污蔑，也是对党中央提出的社会主义建设总路线的污蔑。因为从这个观点中，我们只能得出，总路线是“错误”的，劳动人民的干劲是“盲目”的。
    实际上，我国劳动人民的革命干劲，绝不是什么小资产阶级狂热性的表现。我们所说的劳动人民的革命干劲，首先就是指的亿万劳动人民在大跃进中表现出的那种无比高涨的政治热情，以及在这个基础上产生的藐视一切困难的革命魄力和艰苦奋斗的英雄气概。这种干劲，正是亿万劳动人民冲击事物和建设新社会的重要动力。去年一年，粮食和棉花的产量的增长，就超过了第一个五年计划的五年增长的总和；洋钢的产量的增长速度，也大大超过了第一个五年计划期间的钢产量每年递增31.7％的速度。难道能够设想，没有革命的干劲而能完成这样巨大的，哪怕是比这小得多的任务吗？显然，那是绝不可能的。我们在推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治的斗争中，曾经依靠了这种干劲才取得了胜利；同样的，在完成社会主义的革命和建设的事业中，更需要这种革命的干劲。斯大林在“列宁主义基础”一书中，曾经对革命干劲作过很好的说明。他说：“俄国人的革命胆略是消除因循习惯、守旧思想、保守主义、思想停滞以及对老旧传统的盲从态度的药剂。俄国人的革命胆略是一种振奋人心的力量，它能唤起思想，推动前进，破坏旧事物，开辟前途。没有这种革命胆略，就一步也不能前进。”在这里斯大林所说的“革命的胆略”，也就是我们所说的革命干劲。显然，没有革命的干劲，就不会有任何革命运动，不会有任何大胆的创造，更不会出现任何的跃进。这对我们来说，应当是一种常识。因此，调动亿万人民的革命积极性，鼓足干劲，力争上游，是党中央提出的社会主义建设总路线的一个十分重要的组成部分。如果取消了鼓足干劲和力争上游，那就等于阉割了总路线的实质，也就等于取消了总路线。
    小资产阶级的狂热与我们的革命干劲完全是两回事。如果说革命的干劲是一种青春的活力，是一种革命力量的源泉的话，那末小资产阶级的狂热则是一种病态的热，这种热不仅不会推动社会主义建设，反而会损害社会主义建设。列宁在“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”一书中，对于小资产阶级的狂热病，曾经作过极其深刻的分析。他说：“小有产者，即小业主……，由于在资本主义制度下经常受到压迫，生活往往陡然下降，以至于破产，所以容易激发一种极端的革命狂热，而缺乏坚韧性、组织性、纪律性和坚定精神。”他又说：“这种革命狂热动摇不定，华而不实，有一种很快就转为俯首听命、消沉颓丧、耽于幻想，甚至转为‘疯狂地’醉心于这种或那种资产阶级的‘时髦’思潮的特性，——所有这一切都是人所共知的。”在这里列宁把小资产阶级狂热病产生的根源、主要的表现和最后的归宿，都揭露得一清二楚了。
    只要把列宁对小资产阶级狂热病的分析与现实中广大劳动人民的革命干劲对照一下，我们就看出，这两者是完全不同的，甚至是互相对立的。
    小资产阶级的狂热性的产生，是由小资产阶级的阶级地位决定的。“小资产阶级革命家的许多代表人物希望革命马上胜利，以求根本改变他们今天所处的地位；因而他们对于革命的长期努力缺乏忍耐心，他们对于‘左’的革命词句和口号有很大的兴趣”。“由于各种情况的变化而产生的左右摇摆、好走极端、华而不实、投机取巧，是小资产阶级思想在坏的一面的特点。这是小资产阶级在经济上所处的不稳定地位在思想上的反映”。（中共第六届中央委员会扩大第七次全会关于若干历史问题的决议）而群众的革命干劲则是在党的指导下，在总路线的鼓舞下，为了摆脱我国一穷二白的状况、建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而产生出来的力量。
    小资产阶级的狂热，在通常的情况下，都只是一小群脱离群众的人的行动。俄国的民粹派就是这样的一些人，他们凭一时的革命热情，依靠少数几个人去从事暗杀、恐怖和孤注一掷的活动。不要说动员几亿人，就是动员几十万或几万人，他们也是作不到的。但是，我们的群众运动却是一个包括六亿人口的伟大运动。这样规模宏大的革命运动和劳动人民在运动中表现出来的革命干劲，绝不是某种小资产阶级的狂热所能鼓舞起来的。
    小资产阶级的狂热，往往只是一时狂热。它不仅“动摇不定，华而不实”，而且会“很快就转为俯首听命、消沉颓丧、耽于幻想”。他们有时“左”得很，可是他们常常转而堕落到右倾机会主义的泥坑里去。因此，这种狂热顶多也不过是昙花一现，很快就会烟消云散。但是，广大劳动人民的革命干劲，却是一种方兴未艾、持久不衰的力量。它以“排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力”，一往直前，在任何困难和险阻面前都百折不挠，表现出极大的革命坚忍性。它永远与右倾机会主义的资产阶级思想毫不调和，并且与它作坚决的斗争。同时，越是把机会主义克服得彻底，革命的干劲就会鼓得越足。正因为如此，我们才可能在1958年大跃进的基础上，争取1959年的继续跃进。
    总之，小资产阶级的狂热，正如列宁在同上书中所说的，“它在任何重大问题上，都离开无产阶级进行坚韧的阶级斗争的条件和要求”。而广大人民群众的革命干劲却与此相反，它并不是盲目地蛮干，而是在科学分析和尊重客观规律性的基础上充分发挥人的主观能动作用。它在任何重大问题上都充分考虑到“无产阶级进行坚韧的斗争的条件和要求”。小资产阶级的狂热永远是无根之木，只开花不结果，并且总是以失败或投降作为归宿；而我们群众的革命干劲仅在一年中，结出了史无前例的丰硕果实。
    由于上述原因，我们党从来都坚决反对小资产阶级的狂热，而坚决保护群众的革命干劲；对群众在革命运动中发生的某些缺点采取耐心帮助的办法，而绝不向他们泼冷水。右倾机会主义者打着“反对小资产阶级狂热”的幌子，来反对群众运动，向着群众的革命干劲泼冷水，恰恰证明他们是站在资产阶级的立场上来看待群众运动和群众的革命积极性，从而扮演了极不光彩的角色。事实证明，亿万人民的革命干劲绝不是什么“小资产阶级的狂热”。右倾机会主义者给扣上一个“小资产阶级狂热”的帽子，并不是他们真正对克服“小资产阶级狂热”感到兴趣。“醉翁之意不在酒”，他们的真正目的是要取消党的总路线，取消革命的群众运动。因此，我们必须认清他们的真实目的，毫不动摇地贯彻党中央提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，以此回答国内外反动派和国内右倾机会主义分子的猖狂进攻。
