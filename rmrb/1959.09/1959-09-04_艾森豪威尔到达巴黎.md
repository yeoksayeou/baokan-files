Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 2nd. U.S. President Eisenhower arrived in Paris by plane on September 2nd from London for a visit. French President de Gaulle, Prime Minister Debré, and other French government officials welcomed him at the airport.

Eisenhower is scheduled to stay in the French capital for forty-eight hours. Many newspapers believe that his talks with de Gaulle will be the most difficult and delicate stage of Eisenhower's trip to Western Europe. After meeting with de Gaulle, Eisenhower will meet with Luns, Chairman of the Permanent Representatives Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Secretary-General Spaak; on the morning of the 3rd, he will also receive Italian Prime Minister Segni and Foreign Minister Bella.

Well-informed sources here believe that the Algerian issue will be the central content of the Eisenhower-de Gaulle talks. This is because the United Nations General Assembly is about to open; last year, France narrowly avoided condemnation by only one vote, with the United States abstaining.

In addition, the talks will certainly also involve issues such as mutual visits between Soviet and American leaders, France's participation in the "nuclear club," and France's role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    艾森豪威尔到达巴黎
    新华社巴黎2日电　美国总统艾森豪威尔2日从伦敦乘飞机到达巴黎进行访问。到机场欢迎的有法国总统戴高乐、总理德勃雷和法国政府的其他官员。
    艾森豪威尔预定在法国首都停留四十八小时。许多报纸认为，他同戴高乐之间的会谈将是艾森豪威尔西欧之行中最困难和最微妙的阶段。在同戴高乐会谈后，艾森豪威尔将会见北大西洋集团的常任代表理事会主席伦斯和秘书长斯巴克；3日上午他还将接见意大利总理塞尼和外交部长贝拉。
    此间消息灵通人士认为阿尔及利亚问题将是艾森豪威尔—戴高乐会谈的中心内容。这是因为联合国大会即将开幕；去年法国只以一票之差才幸免于受到谴责，当时美国是投的弃权票。
    另外，会谈肯定还将涉及有关苏美领导人互相访问、法国参加“原子俱乐部”和法国在北大西洋集团中的作用等问题。
