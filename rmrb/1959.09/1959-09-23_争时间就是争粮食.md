Short commentary:

    Seizing Time is Seizing Grain
    Whether sowing is timely is closely related to wheat yield. In the main winter wheat producing areas of our country, the autumnal equinox (September 24th) is the most appropriate sowing period. If sowing is too late, there will be very few tillers before winter, and the wheat roots will not be well developed, making them susceptible to frost damage. According to investigation reports on wheat frost damage in some areas, wheat that has grown three to four tillers before the end of the year has the strongest resistance to cold; most of the wheat that died from frost was sown late. In the former Qiuxian County of Hebei, wheat sown only at the time of the first frost yielded only half as much as wheat sown at the autumnal equinox. In Laiyang, Shandong, when wheat was planted on the same land using the same cultivation methods, each mu yielded 250 jin when sown before the autumnal equinox, but only 145 jin when sown eight days after the cold dew. What a big difference! "Seizing time is seizing grain" is absolutely correct.
    This year's winter wheat planting area will be larger than last year. With the expanded planting area, can we ensure that it is planted quickly and well? We should have full confidence: we can plant more, faster, and better. Compared with last year, the conditions are even better this year. When wheat was planted last year, the people's communes had just been established, and many tasks were not yet ready; this year, we are stronger in terms of organization and technology than last year, and the arrangement of work tasks and labor force is more rational. The conditions are so good, as long as we pool our wisdom and efforts and go all out, we will definitely be able to fully achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in wheat planting.
    The facts in the Pingliang area of Gansu have fully proved this point. Last year, this area planted 5.2 million mu of winter wheat, and this year it will plant at least 200,000 mu more than last year, and strive to plant 300,000 to 400,000 mu more than last year. By September 15, 80% of the winter wheat sowing plan had been completed. What about the quality? It is generally sown after plowing, and it is estimated that 85% to 90% have been plowed twice or more; the fertilizer averages 5,800 jin per mu; more than 99% are using improved varieties. At the same time, they have also managed the autumn fields well; grasping both the future and the present. Why can they do this? The most important thing is to go all out and strive for the top. From the prefectural party committee to the commune party committee, they grasped the work early, acted quickly, prepared adequately, and made thorough arrangements. They also implemented a responsibility system and organized mutual assistance and cooperation between mountain and plain areas, and between shady and sunny slopes. With both drive and perfect methods, more, faster, better, and more economical results are reliably guaranteed.
    Tomorrow is the autumnal equinox, and wheat planting is at the most critical juncture. The Yellow River basin should finish planting winter wheat in the next few days at the latest, and should not be delayed beyond the cold dew (October 9th). The Yangtze River basin should preferably not delay wheat planting beyond the frost (October 24th). In terms of the overall arrangement of this autumn and winter work, work that can be done in advance should be done as early as possible. Taking a step earlier puts you in the driver's seat at every turn; taking a step later puts you in a passive position at every turn. Grasp the time tightly!

### 争时间就是争粮食

    争时间就是争粮食
    播种是不是适时，同小麦的产量有很密切的关系。在我国主要的冬小麦产区，秋分（9月24日）前后是最适当的播种期。播种太迟，冬前分蘖就会很少，麦根也不能很好地发育，容易遭受冻害。根据一些地区关于小麦冻害的调查报告，在年前长好三个到四个分蘖的小麦，抗寒力最强；冻死的小麦，大半是迟播的。河北原丘县到霜降才播种的小麦，产量只相当于秋分播种的小麦产量的一半。山东莱阳在同样的土地上用同样的栽培方法种植的小麦，秋分前播种的每亩可产二百五十斤，寒露后八天播种的，每亩只产一百四十五斤。这是多么大的差别！“争时间就是争粮食”，真是一点也不错。
    今年冬小麦的播种面积要比去年扩大。扩大了播种面积，能不能保证种得快种得好呢？应该有充分的信心：既能种得多，也能种得快、种得好。今年与去年相比，条件已经更好了。去年种麦的时候，人民公社刚刚建立起来，很多工作都还没有就绪；今年，在组织上、技术上都比去年更强了，工作任务的安排和劳动力的安排都更为合理。条件是这样好，只要群策群力，鼓足干劲，在种麦工作中就一定能全面实现多、快、好、省。
    甘肃平凉地区的事实已经充分地证明了这一点。这个地区去年种冬小麦五百二十万亩，今年至少要比去年多种二十万亩，还要争取比去年多种三十万到四十万亩。到9月15日，冬小麦播种计划已经完成了80％。质量如何？普遍是耕过以后种的，耕了两遍和两遍以上的估计可以达到85％到90％；肥料，平均每亩五千八百斤；99％以上都是选用良种。同时，还做到了管好秋田；既抓明年，也抓当前。为什么能做到这样？最要紧的就是鼓足干劲，力争上游。从地委到公社党委，抓得早，行动快，准备充足，布置周密。他们还实行了责任制度，组织了山区和平地、阴坡和阳坡各单位之间的互助协作。既有干劲，又有完善的办法，多、快、好、省就有了可靠的保证。
    明天就是秋分，种麦工作已到了最要紧的关头。黄河流域最好在最近几天就把冬小麦种完，至迟也不可拖过寒露（10月9日），长江流域最好也不要把种麦时间拖过霜降（10月24日）。就今年秋冬工作的全面安排来说，也要把能提前做的工作尽可能提前做好。早走一步，步步主动；迟走一步，步步被动。紧紧地把握住时间吧！
