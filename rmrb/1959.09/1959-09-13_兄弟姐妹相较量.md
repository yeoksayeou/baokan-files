Siblings competing against each other are not uncommon at the National Games. They instruct each other in practice, compensating for each other's weaknesses, but in the National Games competitions, they will not yield to each other and will do their best.

In the Sichuan team, the nineteen-year-old twin sisters Chen Guide and Chen Guili are both gymnastics athletes. Another pair of sisters is in the Hebei team; the elder sister, Yang Bozi, is twenty-one years old, and the younger sister, Yang Hezi, is nineteen years old, both of whom are sports athletes.

There is also a pair of sisters competing in the swimming pool. Seventeen-year-old Shanghai athlete Liu Yusen is the creator of China's women's 100-meter breaststroke record, while her sister Liu Lisen represents Hebei and is also a good player. There are two pairs of brothers in the table tennis arena, one pair being Zhou Lansun and Zhou Shusen, representing the Shanxi and Zhejiang teams respectively. The other pair of brothers are Wu Xiaode and Wu Xiaoming from the Zhejiang team.
