Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 16th: President Sukarno summoned Acting Attorney General and Acting Military Attorney General Tarunamihaaga to the Presidential Palace this morning and spoke with him for about an hour. Tarunamihaaga was escorted to the Presidential Palace by two military police officers.

It is reported that on the night of September 10th, Lieutenant General Nasution, in his capacity as the Central War Administrator of the Army, ordered the detention of Tarunamihaaga and interrogated him on the 12th. The Army authorities believe that he engaged in certain activities "to undermine the prestige of the Army leadership" and "create a tense atmosphere." According to a statement issued by the Army Department, prior to taking this action, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, Gatot Subroto, convened a meeting at the Army Headquarters, which considered this action necessary. At the same time, Central War Administrator and Army Chief of Staff Nasution also held talks with Indonesian First Minister Djuanda and others.

After Tarunamihaaga's arrest, many urgent issues needed to be resolved by Sukarno. It is reported that Sukarno, after returning from an inspection tour of outer islands on September 14th, immediately consulted with First Minister Djuanda. He summoned Minister of Defense and Security Lieutenant General Nasution on the 15th, and Sukarno is scheduled to hold talks with Djuanda and Nasution together on the 17th.

    苏加诺总统
    召见被陆军当局扣押的代理检察总长
    据新华社雅加达16日电　苏加诺总统今天上午传召代理检察总长兼代理军事检察总长塔鲁纳米哈加到总统府去，并且同他谈了大约一个钟头。塔鲁纳米哈加是在两名军警护送下到总统府去的。
    据报道，9月10日深夜，纳苏蒂安中将以陆军中央战时掌权者的资格下令拘留了塔鲁纳米哈加，并在12日对他进行了审讯。陆军当局认为，他进行某种活动，“以破坏陆军领导机构的威信”和“制造紧张气氛”。据陆军部发表的声明说，在采取这一行动之前，陆军副参谋长加托特·苏布罗托在陆军总部召开了会议，会议认为，采取这一行动是必要的。与此同时，中央战时掌权者、陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安还同印度尼西亚政府第一部长朱安达等人举行了会谈。
    在塔鲁纳米哈加被捕后，有许多迫切的问题有待苏加诺来解决。据报道，苏加诺在9月14日从外岛地区视察旅行回来后立即同第一部长朱安达商谈。他在15日召见了国防和安全部长纳苏蒂安中将，苏加诺预定在17日同朱安达和纳苏蒂安一起举行会谈。
