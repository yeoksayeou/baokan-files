Taming the Rampaging Dragon
——After Watching the New Documentary "Man Will Conquer Nature" Xin Xuan
In mid-June, some areas of Guangdong Province suffered severe flooding. The East, West, and North Rivers experienced the worst floods in a century. The people in the areas along the rivers, the Pearl River Delta, and Guangzhou City were hit by the floods, and more than a dozen counties and cities were severely affected, suffering great losses. However, under the strong leadership of the Party, the Party, government, army, and people united as one to fight the flood and provide disaster relief. Not only did they subdue the dragon demon, but they also rebuilt their homes, striving to eliminate the traces of the disaster by autumn. The film "Man Will Conquer Nature" is an eyewitness account of this battle. It narrates the beginning and end of this battle, and demonstrates the heroic spirit of the people in the disaster area. When the earth-shaking thunder, rainstorms, and raging tides attempted to plunder everything in the human world, people had already organized themselves: a million-strong army, on the one hand, protected the dikes, reinforced them, and rushed to repair them day and night, engaging in a final battle between the dikes and the flood; on the other hand, they plunged into the water to cut rice, seizing grain from the dragon king's mouth; at the same time, they rescued the disaster victims in the dangerous areas to safe places. In some places, the water was too fierce, and people were caught off guard, and a few people were trapped in the flood. The situation was indeed extremely urgent. However, the People's Liberation Army's rescue boats arrived; airplanes loaded with biscuits and clothes came with airdrops; and the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee's infinite concern, warmth, and inspiring letters of condolences were also sent. We saw some old ladies in the film who did not lose confidence or cry in fear because of the disaster. They firmly believed that with the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and the support of the People's Liberation Army, even the greatest difficulties could be overcome. But after hearing the letter of condolences, they were moved to tears. The disaster victims received all kinds of spiritual and material support, and Guangzhou was also safe and sound. The people who had just overcome the flood immediately launched the "retreat one inch, production advances one inch," and "if one mu is flooded, plant two mu" production self-rescue and reconstruction movement. Although in the severely affected areas after the flood receded, one could not see any signs of being emotionally affected by the disaster. However, when I consulted the "Guangzhou Prefecture Records" and "Huizhou Prefecture Records" compiled during the Guangxu years, I found two records of disasters: "(Daoguang Thirteenth Year) In the autumn, there was heavy rain in the seventh month, and the water in the low-lying areas of the city was more than ten feet deep. The higher areas were also four or five feet deep, destroying countless houses and drowning people... The late rice could not be planted, and the people were starving." (Guangzhou); "(Tongzhi Third Year) In July, there was a great flood, and countless villages and markets were flooded in the two rivers, and floating corpses covered the water surface." (Huiyang). The two are indeed a stark contrast. As Comrade Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, explained, we have a Party that serves the people, a state of the proletarian dictatorship, people's communes with unlimited vitality, and we are in an era of great leaps forward. Therefore, the hardworking and brave people have no insurmountable difficulties. This is not only something that could not be done in the past under reactionary rule, but it is also something that cannot be done in capitalist countries, but we can certainly do it.
The film reflects everything so realistically that the audience's mind remains in the tense state characteristic of engaging in arduous struggles; the images it presents are so vivid that after watching the film, you will naturally feel as if you are in the heat of the mass struggle, and you will love the great Party and motherland even more, love the people who overcome all obstacles that hinder our socialist construction, and be even more determined to share more worries and dedicate more effort to the socialist motherland. The strong effect of the film is determined by the seriousness and combativeness of the subject matter, and the artistic skills of the filmmakers also played a great role. This film is like a bold, magnificent, and freehand ink painting. It wrote about the heroic aspirations and strength of the people who tamed the rampaging dragon.

    力缚狂龙
    ——新影纪录片“人定胜天”观后	辛萱
    6月中下旬，广东部分地区暴雨成灾。东、西、北江出现了百年特大洪峰。沿江地区、珠江三角洲和广州市人民遭到洪水袭击，十几个县市成为重灾区，损失很大；但在党的坚强领导下，党政军民万众一心，抗洪救灾，不但降服了龙魔，还要重建家园，力争在秋后消灭灾痕。“人定胜天”这部影片就是这场搏斗的目击记。它叙述了这场搏斗的始末，表现了灾区人民磅礴无畏的英雄气概。当震天动地的轰雷、暴雨、狂潮企图来洗劫人间一切的时候，人们早已组织起来了：百万大军一面护堤防险，加高加固，日夜赶修，把堤防和洪水决赛；一面钻到水里割稻，从龙王嘴里夺粮食；同时把险区的灾民抢救到安全地带去。有些地方水势太猛，猝不及防，少数人陷在大水里，情况确实万分火急。但是，解放军的救命船开来了；飞机装满饼干和衣服空投来了；中共广东省委的无限关切、温暖和鼓舞人心的慰问信也送来了。我们从影片中看到一些老太太，她们没有因灾害而失去信心，惊恐啼哭，她们坚信，有党和人民政府的领导，有人民解放军的支援，天大的困难也能克服。但是在听到慰问信以后却感动得掉下眼泪来。灾民得到了各种各样精神的和物质的支援，广州也安然无恙。刚刚战胜洪水的人们，立即又展开了“水退一寸，生产前进一寸”、“淹一亩、种两亩”的生产自救重建家园运动。虽然在水退后的重灾区，也看不到受灾的情绪。然而我在翻阅光绪年间编修的“广州府志”和“惠州府志”时却发现有这样两条灾情实录：“（道光十三年）秋七月大雨、城中地卑者水深丈余。高者亦四五尺、坏屋溺人无算……晚禾弗克莳民大饥”（广州）；“（同治三年）七月大水，两江村市田庐漂荡无算、浮尸遍水面”（惠阳）。二者真是强烈的对照。这里正如中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志所说明的，我们有为人民服务的党，有无产阶级专政的国家，有无限生命力的人民公社，又处在大跃进的年代，所以，勤劳而勇敢的人民没有不可克服的困难。这不仅是过去反动统治时代所办不到的事，就是在资本主义国家也是办不到的事，我们却一定能办得到。
    这部影片它所反映的一切都是那样的真实，以致观众的心一直保持在从事艰苦斗争时特有的那种紧张状态之中；它所表现出来的形象是那样的生动，使你看完片子之后会自然而然地觉得自己仿佛就在群众斗争的热流中，更加热爱伟大的党和祖国，热爱战胜一切阻碍我们建设社会主义逆流的人民，更坚定地要为社会主义祖国分担更多的忧患，掬献更多的心血。影片这种强烈的效果固然是由题材的严肃性和战斗性决定，同时影片作者的艺术手腕也起了很大的作用。这部影片真像一幅粗犷、雄壮、大笔淋漓的泼墨画。写出了力缚狂龙的人民的豪情壮志和力量。
