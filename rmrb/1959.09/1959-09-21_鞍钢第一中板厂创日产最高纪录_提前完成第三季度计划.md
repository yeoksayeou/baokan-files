Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th - The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's First Medium Plate Mill have once again dedicated new gifts to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation. The mill completed its third-quarter production plan for high-quality steel plates ten days and sixteen hours ahead of schedule and also created the highest daily production level since its opening. The first-class steel plate rate also increased compared to the plan.

Since August, all the workers of this factory have earnestly implemented the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and are full of energy. Production workers took the lead. The Sun Haiquan team of Class A, whose production was relatively lagging behind, sent people to the advanced Dong Wanli team to "learn from experience," and caught up with the Dong Wanli team in a few days. The Dong Wanli team also took measures to catch up. In this way, through mutual pursuit and competition, Class A's steel plate rolling output repeatedly created new records. Class A workers also achieved significant results in inter-class competitions with Class B and Class C workers. Repair workers shortened repair time by 30% to meet the needs of increased steel plate production.

    鞍钢第一中板厂创日产最高纪录
    提前完成第三季度计划
    据新华社鞍山20日电　鞍钢第一中板厂的职工又为庆祝建国十周年，献出新的礼品。这个厂提前十天零十六小时完成了第三季度优质钢板的生产计划，并且创造了开工以来的最高日产水平。钢板一级品率也比计划提高。
    8月份以来，这个工厂的全体职工，认真贯彻了党的八届八中全会的精神，个个干劲十足。生产工人一马当先，甲班生产比较落后的孙海泉小组，派人到先进的董万里小组“取经”，几天后就赶上了董万里小组。董万里小组也采取措施赶上去。这样，你追我赶，甲班轧钢板产量，连续创造几次新纪录。甲班工人与乙班、丙班工人展开班际竞赛，也取得显著成绩。修理工人将修理时间缩短30％，满足增产钢板的需要。
