    In Front of the Display Window
    Recently, Huaihai Road in Shanghai has been a riot of color. The window displays from ten cities have decorated this street as if for a festival. The window designers, using artistic techniques and commodity arrangements, have reflected the continuous development of current industrial and agricultural production and the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, winning praise from the broad masses.
    The window display in Beijing, with the theme of promoting woolen fabrics, arranged several pieces of peach-red, light-colored plaid, and green woolen material undulating up and down. A golden horse carries a gray-blue material, traversing from right to left, breaking the monotony of the layout and making the entire picture appear open, generous, and imposing, fully expressing the theme of continuously improving the quality of woolen products.
    The window in Tianjin, using a close-up artistic form, reported to everyone the achievements of Tianjin's product—White Elephant brand soap—in the Great Leap Forward. The theme promotes soap, and also promotes scented soap and enamel basins, organically linking commodities and life. The left two-thirds of the background is white, and the right side is green, the proportions are very appropriate, and the color matching is very harmonious.
    In order to make it easier for mothers or aunts to choose towels or handkerchiefs for their children, and to inspire children to pay attention to hygiene and love labor, the Shanghai window designers chose children's favorite bath towels, face towels, and handkerchiefs as the theme of the window. A sleeping child dreams of the various things he encountered during the day as a backdrop, with bright, optimistic, lively, and comfortable colors, forming a touching picture.
    The designers of the Hangzhou window are ingenious. They successfully combined the goods and the backings. On the left, they selected silks of different colors, arranged in the order of the spectrum as a backing; on the right, a white backing is decorated with a green mulberry leaf and silkworm, highlighting the importance of developing the silk industry; a flower silk is suspended in the middle, making the calm layout appear active.
    Representatives from Guangzhou and Chengdu arranged windows for local specialties—handicrafts. Guangzhou selected Shiwan ceramics, displayed in a curio cabinet, organizing the relatively fragmented commodities, with several palm trees outside the window as a backdrop, rich in southern flavor; Chengdu took Sichuan's unique bamboo weaving as the theme, with bright yellow silk fabrics as a backdrop, making the commodities appear antique and unique.
    The windows designed by Harbin and Wuhan promoted the characteristics of local industrial products. Wuhan took the local product bed sheet as the theme, supplemented by a distant view of the Yangtze River Bridge as a backdrop; Harbin took the promotion of tussah silk as the theme, supplemented by the Songhua River as a backdrop, and the effect was good. The cotton cloth display in Luoyang, with its light, lively, symmetrical, and healthy lines, is also very popular.
    These beautiful and meaningful window designs reflect the leaping progress of the Chinese people. Zhou Ruilin

    在橱窗前
    最近，上海市淮海路上群芳争艳，十个城市展出的橱窗陈列把这条街道打扮得节日一般。橱窗设计者们，以艺术的手法，通过商品布置，把当前工农业生产不断发展，人民物质文化生活水平不断提高的面貌反映了出来，博得了广大群众的称赞。
    北京市的橱窗陈列，以宣传呢绒为主题，布置了几块桃红的、浅色带格的、绿色的上下起伏的毛料，用金马驮起一条灰蓝色的料子，自右至左横贯而上，冲破了布局的平淡，使整个画面显得开阔、大方，有气势，充分表达了呢绒产品质量不断提高的主题思想。
    天津市的橱窗，以特写的艺术形式，向大家汇报了天津产品——白象牌肥皂在大跃进中取得的成就。主题宣传肥皂，联带宣传香皂和搪瓷面盆，使商品和生活有机地联系起来。背景左边三分之二用白色，右边用绿色，比例很恰当，色彩调配的非常和谐。
    为了便于母亲或阿姨们给孩子们选购毛巾或手帕，启发儿童讲究卫生，热爱劳动，上海市的橱窗设计者选择了儿童所喜爱的浴巾、面巾、手帕为橱窗主题，以一个入睡的儿童，梦见白日里所接触的各项事物为衬托，着色明朗、乐观、活泼、舒畅，构成一幅动人的画面。
    杭州市橱窗的设计者别出心裁。他们成功地把商品和背衬结合在一起，左边选择不同颜色的丝绸，按着光谱的顺序排列作为背衬；右面白色背衬上用一片绿色桑叶和蚕装饰起来，突出了发展蚕丝事业的重要；中间悬起一条花绸，使平静的布局显得活跃起来。
    广州、成都来的代表，布置了地方特产——工艺品橱窗。广州选用了石湾瓷器，用百宝格陈列，把比较零碎的商品组织起来，背衬窗外几株棕榈，富有南方风味；成都则以四川特有的竹丝编物为主题，背衬饰以鲜黄色的丝织物，把商品衬托得古色古香，别具一格。
    哈尔滨、武汉市设计的橱窗，宣传了地方工业品的特色。武汉市以地方产品床单为主题，辅以长江大桥远景为背衬；哈尔滨市以宣传柞蚕丝绸为主题，辅以松花江畔为背衬、效果都不错。洛阳市的棉布陈列，线条轻松、活泼、匀称、健康，也很招人喜爱。
    这些美观而有意义的橱窗设计，反映了我国人民的跃进面貌。	周瑞林
