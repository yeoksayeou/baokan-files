Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: The First National Games has entered its final stage. Today is mainly focused on fierce ball game competitions, the last battle for the championship. All events will conclude tomorrow, and the winners will be determined.

The semi-finals of the men's and women's singles, doubles, and mixed doubles in table tennis were held today. Those who qualified for the finals are Wang Chuanyao and Zhuang Jiafu in men's singles, Ye Peiqiong and Hu Keming in women's singles, Wang Chuanyao/Zhuang Zedong and Jiang Yongning/Zhuang Jiafu in men's doubles, Chi Huifang/Zhu Peimin and Qiu Zhonghui/Ye Peiqiong in women's doubles, and Zhou Lansun/Yang Yueying and Zhuang Zedong/Qiu Zhonghui in mixed doubles. They will compete in the finals on the 27th.

Today, Wang Chuanyao defeated Jiang Yongning, known for his chop defense, with his ambidextrous style, with a score of 3-1. Li Furong, who had defeated Rong Guotuan, faced Zhuang Jiafu today. Zhuang Jiafu used spin and no-spin chop defense, causing Li Furong's powerful smashes to frequently fail or go out of bounds. As a result, Zhuang Jiafu won 3-0. Hu Keming's left push and right attack were excellent today, with fierce shots, defeating Qiu Zhonghui with a decisive 3-0 victory. Ye Peiqiong's defense was solid, also defeating Sun Meiying 3-0.

Today, the top four men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles players competed for the top two spots. In both men's doubles matches, Beijing players won. Wang Chuanyao and Zhuang Zedong defeated Wang Hongji and Zhu Renlong of Shanxi 3-1, and Jiang Yongning and Zhuang Jiafu defeated Xue Weichu and Li Furong of Shanghai 3-0. Jiang Yongning and Zhuang Jiafu were defeated by Wang Chuanyao and Fu Qifang last year and placed second. This time, Wang Chuanyao is partnered with Zhuang Zedong, a famous young player from the Beijing team. It is expected that there will be a fierce battle for the doubles championship tomorrow. In women's doubles, last year's doubles champions, Chi Huifang and Zhu Peimin from Shanghai, will compete against Qiu Zhonghui and Ye Peiqiong from Beijing. Chi Huifang and Zhu Peimin defeated Han Yuzhen and Sui Chunling of Heilongjiang 3-0 today, and Qiu Zhonghui and Ye Peiqiong also defeated Zhang Yun and Hu Shufen of Hubei 3-0.

The top two mixed doubles matches were also held today. Zhou Lansun and Yang Yueying of Shanxi defeated Xu Yinsheng and Chi Huifang of Shanghai 3-1, and Zhuang Zedong and Qiu Zhonghui of Beijing defeated Jiang Yongning and Ye Peiqiong 3-1. The mixed doubles championship final tomorrow will be contested between Zhou Lansun/Yang Yueying and Zhuang Zedong/Qiu Zhonghui.

Four basketball finals were held today. The top three places in the men's group will be determined by the result of the match between the People's Liberation Army team and the Beijing team on the evening of the 27th. The Sichuan team defeated their last opponent, the Hebei team, on the 25th, achieving a record of ten wins in eleven games. The People's Liberation Army team has nine wins in ten games, and the Beijing team has eight wins in ten games. If the People's Liberation Army team defeats Beijing tonight, their points will be equal to those of the Sichuan team, but the People's Liberation Army team defeated Sichuan by one point. According to the competition rules, the People's Liberation Army team will be the champion, Sichuan will be the runner-up, and Beijing will be third. If the People's Liberation Army team loses to Beijing, their points will be equal to those of the Beijing team. According to the rules, their ranking will be behind Beijing, resulting in Sichuan as the champion, Beijing as the runner-up, and the People's Liberation Army team in third place. The fourth and fifth places have been determined as the Jiangsu team and the Hebei team, with seven wins and four losses. The sixth and seventh places are the Liaoning team and the Shanghai team, with five wins and six losses. The Jilin team and the Heilongjiang team are ranked eighth and ninth, with four wins and seven losses.

In women's basketball, the Beijing team has ten wins in ten games, and the People's Liberation Army team has eight wins and two losses. Although they will play one more game tomorrow night, regardless of who wins or loses, according to the points calculation, the Beijing women's team is definitely the champion, and the People's Liberation Army women's team is guaranteed second place.

The second stage finals of the football competition have had twenty-nine games played out of a total of thirty, but the top five rankings cannot yet be determined.

Two more games were held today in the first group, competing for the top six places. Liaoning and Beijing tied 0-0, and Guangdong won 2-1 against Shaanxi. Because Hebei, Liaoning, and Beijing currently have the same points, six points each (according to two points for a win, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss); the People's Liberation Army and Guangdong also have the same points, five points each; and Hebei and the People's Liberation Army still have one game to be held, and they can still score points if they win. If the People's Liberation Army team defeats Hebei tomorrow, they can win the championship; if they lose, they can only get fifth place. Therefore, tomorrow's crucial battle may affect the entire ranking of the top five.

The competition for the seventh to twelfth places in the second group has ended today, and the rankings have also been determined. Today, Shanghai defeated Jilin 5-0; Hubei defeated Jiangsu 3-0; Sichuan defeated Heilongjiang 1-0. Thus, Shanghai won seventh place with three wins, one draw, and one loss. Jilin also had three wins, one draw, and one loss, but lost to Shanghai, so they won eighth place. Ninth place went to Sichuan, tenth to Hubei, eleventh to Heilongjiang, and twelfth to Jiangsu.

Today, competitions were also held in volleyball, badminton, gymnastics, shooting, and road cycling.

Tomorrow (the 27th) is the last day of the First National Games, and some unfinished events will end on this day, so it is also a decisive day. In addition to football, basketball, and table tennis, twelve volleyball games will be played on the 27th. The two games between the People's Liberation Army men's and women's teams and the Shanghai men's and women's teams in the evening will be the "finale" battles for the championship. In badminton, four men's and women's singles games will be held, including one where Wang Wenjiao and Chen Fushou of Fujian will compete for the men's singles champion and runner-up, and one where Chen Jiaoyan of Fujian and Peng Yuemei of Guangdong will compete for the women's singles champion.

    足、篮、排、乒乓、羽毛各项球类比赛
    冠军谁属且看今日决战
    据新华社26日讯　第一届全国运动会已进入比赛结束前夕，今天主要是球类的激战，为取得冠军作最后的争夺，明天各个项目比赛将全部结束，分出胜负。
    乒乓球男、女单打、双打和混合双打五项准决赛今天进行。获得决赛权的男子单打是王传耀和庄家富，女子单打是叶珮琼和胡克明，男子双打是王传耀、庄则栋组和姜永宁、庄家富组，女子双打是池惠芳、朱培民组和丘钟惠、叶珮琼组，混合双打是周兰荪、杨月英组和庄则栋、丘钟惠组，他们将在27日进行决赛。
    今天，王传耀以他擅长的左右开弓战胜了以削球防守著称的姜永宁，比分是三比一。曾战胜容国团的李富荣，今天和庄家富交锋，庄家富用有转和不转的削球防守，使李富荣的大板扣杀屡屡落网或出界，结果庄家富以三比零胜。胡克明的左推右攻今天打得十分出色，抽击凶狠，以三比零的绝对优势击败了丘钟惠。叶珮琼则防守稳健，同样以三比零战胜了孙梅英。
    今天，进入前四名的男女双打和混合双打选手，为争夺前两名进行了决战。两场男子双打比赛结果都是北京选手获胜，王传耀和庄则栋以三比一胜山西王宏基和朱人龙，姜永宁和庄家富以三比零胜上海薛伟初和李富荣。姜永宁和庄家富去年曾被王传耀和傅其芳击败而居第二，这次与王传耀合作的是北京队著名的小将庄则栋。预料明天争夺双打冠军时将有一番激战。女子双打由去年双打冠军、上海池惠芳和朱培民与北京丘钟惠和叶珮琼争夺。池惠芳和朱培民今天以三比零胜黑龙江的韩玉珍、隋春玲，丘钟惠和叶珮琼也以三比零胜湖北张云和胡淑芬。
    男女混合双打今天也进行了前两名的决战，结果山西周兰荪和杨月英以三比一胜上海徐寅生和池惠芳，北京庄则栋和丘钟惠以三比一胜姜永宁和叶珮琼。明天混合双打冠军决赛将由周兰荪、杨月英和庄则栋、丘钟惠争夺。
    篮球决赛今天进行四场比赛，男子组前三名的名次，将要看27日晚解放军队对北京队的比赛结果确定。四川队25日战胜最后一个对手河北队，获得十一战十胜的成绩，解放军队是十战九胜，北京队是十战八胜。如果今晚解放军队战胜北京，积分和四川队相等，但解放军队曾以一分胜四川，按照竞赛规定，解放军队得冠军，四川亚军，北京第三。如果解放军队败于北京，积分则和北京队相等，按照规定，名次将排列在北京后面，结果将是四川冠军，北京亚军，解放军则名列第三。第四、五名已确定是七胜四负的江苏队和河北队，第六、七名是五胜六负的辽宁队和上海队，四胜七负的吉林队和黑龙江队列第八名和第九名。
    女子篮球，北京队是十战十胜，解放军队八胜二负，她们虽然还将在明天晚上比赛一场，但是不管谁胜谁负，根据积分推算，北京女子队已肯定是冠军，解放军女队稳得第二名了。
    足球第二段决赛，到今天三十场比赛已进行了二十九场，但前五名名次还无法确定。
    第一组争夺前六名名次的足球劲旅今天又举行了两场比赛，辽宁对北京队零比零踢平，广东二比一胜陕西队。由于河北、辽宁、北京三队目前积分相等，都是六分（按胜一场得两分、平一场得一分、负一场零分计算）；解放军、广东两队也积分相等，都是五分；而河北、解放军两队还有一场比赛待举行，获胜时仍可得分。如果明天解放军队战胜河北，可获冠军；如打败了，就只能获得第五名。因此明天一场关键性的决战可能牵动整个前五名名次的排列。
    第二组争夺第七名至十二名名次的比赛今天已全部结束，名次也已确定。今天上海队以五比○战胜了吉林队；湖北队三比○胜江苏队；四川队一比○胜黑龙江队。至此，上海队以三胜一平一负的成绩夺得了第七名。吉林队也是三胜一平一负，但败于上海队，故获得第八名。第九名四川，第十名湖北，第十一名黑龙江，第十二名江苏。
    今天还进行了排球、羽毛球、体操、射击和公路自行车的比赛。
    明天（27日）是第一届全国运动会的最后一天，一些还未结束的项目都要这一天结束，因此也是决定性的一天。除足球、篮球、乒乓球外，排球在27日还要进行十二场比赛，晚上解放军男、女队对上 海男、女队的两场比赛，将是争夺和产生冠军的“压轴战”，羽毛球的四场男、女单打比赛，其中有一场是福建队的王文教和陈福寿争夺男子单打冠军、亚军，一场是福建队的陈家琰和广东的彭月梅争夺女子单打冠军。
