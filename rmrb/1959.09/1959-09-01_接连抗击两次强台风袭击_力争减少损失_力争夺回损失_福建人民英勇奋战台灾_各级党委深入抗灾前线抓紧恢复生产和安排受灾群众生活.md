Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 31st: Under the strong leadership of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the broad masses fought bravely, and the people of Fujian overcame a Force 12 typhoon, achieving a major victory in the fight against the wind.

Starting from August 28th, a strong typhoon from the Pacific Ocean affected coastal areas of Fujian. By 13:00 on August 30th, the center of the Force 12+ typhoon landed in Putian County. Before and after the typhoon's landfall, wind forces in coastal areas were at Force 10 to Force 12 or above. After the heroic and tenacious resistance of millions of anti-typhoon troops throughout the province, they finally overcame the rare strong typhoon attack since liberation. Due to sufficient prior preparation, strict anti-typhoon organization, and extremely rapid action, the disaster caused by the typhoon was greatly reduced, ensuring the safety of people's lives and property. As of the evening of the 30th, incomplete statistics showed: a total of three residents died, fifty-seven were injured, six were missing, 774 houses collapsed, 7,784 were damaged, 43 boats were lost or did not return to port, and a total of more than 153,000 mu of sweet potatoes, sugarcane, jute, and other crops suffered losses; more than 45,000 fruit trees were blown down or broken, and more than 11,000 tons of fruit were blown off.

The powerful strength of the people's communes in various places was fully demonstrated in this struggle against the strong typhoon. Before the typhoon struck, people's communes in various places, with the participation of party and government cadres at all levels and the support of garrison troops, quickly organized millions of anti-typhoon troops, taking the commune or production team as a unit, forming rescue teams, patrol teams, dike reinforcement teams, etc., responsible for specific areas and lines, and quickly prepared a large number of anti-typhoon and rescue materials. In the fierce battle against the typhoon, various places quickly repaired more than 350 kilometers of sea dikes, promptly transferred more than 50,000 households of residents living in dangerous areas and dangerous houses, protected important warehouses, basic construction sites, and factories, and harvested a large number of mature jute, peanuts, and longan. Under the timely notification and organization of the communes, the vast majority of fishermen at sea safely returned to the mainland before the typhoon arrived. Almost all large and small boats along the coast entered sheltered harbors and were dragged ashore early.

During the strong typhoon's invasion, party and government cadres at all levels went deep into the front lines with commune cadres to direct and fight alongside the masses. Under the leadership of more than 30 cadres, the Sandu Commune of Ningde County organized a rescue team of more than 3,300 people in each brigade within one or two hours to guard three reservoirs. When the wind force gradually increased to Force 12 or above and torrential rain poured down, with a rainfall of 150 millimeters per hour, the commune quickly mobilized a rescue team of more than 2,000 people to participate in the repair of embankments. According to the fact that the wind force on the seawall was the strongest, each commune in Pingtan County organized more than 3,000 people, mainly young people, into a dike protection army. Led by the party committee and commune cadres, the young commune members reinforced the seawall day and night, and in a very short period of time, they repaired 579 seawalls, enabling the county's seawalls to safely pass the dangerous period of strong typhoons and rainstorms, protecting the safety of large areas of crops in the communes. The Gushan Commune in the suburbs of Fuzhou City further demonstrated the great power of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers working together to overcome natural disasters. The workers of the Gushan Farm Implement Factory of this commune rushed to produce a large number of iron nails overnight to support the disaster relief needs of various production brigades; the commune's commercial departments also tried every means to prepare materials such as timber, kerosene, and batteries to supply the urgent needs of various aspects of rescue. The commune's medical department organized 80 medical personnel, set up 30 anti-typhoon first-aid stations, and equipped all 135 first-aiders who had been trained in advance with first-aid kits, so that there were doctors in each brigade and first-aiders in each production team during the anti-typhoon effort. The militia teams of each production team were the backbone of dike repair and rescue, and they were responsible for protecting and reinforcing the dangerous sections of the river dikes within the scope of the entire commune.

After the strong typhoon, torrential rain followed, and the four million anti-typhoon troops in the province are now fully shifting to the struggle against torrential rain and mountain floods. After the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting last night to study strengthening wind and flood prevention work, it held a production and disaster relief telephone conference tonight to deploy continued disaster relief and work in September and October, calling on all localities to repair two places for every water conservancy facility damaged and to build two new fishing boats for every fishing boat lost. Continue to raise and reinforce sea dikes, river dikes, reservoirs, and other water conservancy projects day and night to ensure the safety of residents' lives and property and to do a good job in subsequent production and disaster relief work. The people of Fujian, who have overcome the typhoon, are fighting against the rainstorms. At the same time, they are quickly organizing the restoration of normalcy and handling the aftermath. Party committees and people's communes in various places have promptly arranged food, housing, clothing, and other living issues for the affected masses, and the treatment of the injured and the burial of the dead are being properly arranged, and efforts are being organized to harvest mature disaster-stricken mid-season rice, jute, peanuts, and fruits. Replanting, seedling support, soil addition, and topdressing are being carried out for disaster-stricken late rice, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables to promote their rapid transition and growth. Fishing areas are seizing the time to repair fishing grounds and nets so that they can quickly go to sea for production after the typhoon and rainstorms subside.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 31st: The broad masses of workers and peasants in the areas of southern Fujian that suffered from the typhoon disaster on August 23rd are actively fighting the disaster and restoring production under the leadership of party organizations at all levels.

In recent days, in Haicheng, Longxi, Zhangpu, Zhangzhou and other places, more than 200,000 people have been involved in disaster relief and restoration of production. Most of the broken embankments in coastal areas of Longxi, Haicheng and other counties have been quickly blocked and reinforced. The flooded crops in various places have basically been drained and the seedlings have been washed. Various places have also harvested more than 32,000 dan of fallen longan, bananas, pomelos and other fruits. A large number of fallen fruit trees have been straightened, and more than 11,000 mu of sugarcane have been erected.

The Force 12 typhoon that landed on the coast of Xiamen, Haicheng, Longxi and other places in southern Fujian on August 23rd was rare in decades. Before the arrival of the typhoon, the party and government leading departments in Fujian Province and the coastal areas of southern Fujian led the masses to carry out defense as early as possible to reduce some losses, but due to the excessive wind force, rapid arrival, and violent momentum, although necessary preparations were made, serious losses were still suffered under irresistible circumstances. Further investigation revealed that a total of 720 people died, 618 were injured, and 996 were missing. The houses in various disaster-stricken areas were severely damaged. In Longxi County and Zhangzhou City and other places, 5,397 houses collapsed and 23,106 were damaged. In Xiamen City and Haicheng County, 80% to 90% of the houses collapsed and were damaged. Sea dikes in many sections along the coast of Longxi, Haicheng, and Zhangpu were breached, and large areas of farmland and salt fields were destroyed. A total of more than 3,400 large and small boats were sunk and damaged in the storms in various places, and 287 were washed away. Livestock losses were also considerable in various places. After the disaster, party and government authorities in various places took follow-up measures, and production and life order have gradually returned to normal in the past week.

Workers in factories and basic construction sites in Xiamen City and Zhangzhou City overcame various difficulties and quickly resumed production, determined to win high yields in August and September. After the disaster, workers in various factories and handicraft cooperatives in Xiamen City and Zhangzhou City continued to produce in sheds, canteens, dormitories or in the open air while repairing their workshops. Nine bamboo ware production cooperatives not only quickly restored production on their own, but also concentrated the workers and family members of the entire industry to rush to make bamboo sheds to support factories and rural areas and accelerate the restoration of production.

The people's communes in various places have exerted great power in leading and organizing disaster relief and rescue struggles. Under the unified leadership of the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Longxi County quickly launched a large-scale production movement of 100,000 people centered on disaster relief and restoration of production, determined to regain what was taken away by the typhoon. The secretaries and members of the party committees of the communes went deep into the production teams and fought together with the masses. In the severely affected Jiaowei Commune of this county, under the unified organization of the commune, more than 10,000 people were mobilized every day to repair embankments and rescue crops day and night.

The masses in non-disaster areas throughout the province have carried forward the spirit of great cooperation and vigorously supported the people in the disaster areas in terms of manpower and materials. Peace, Nanjing, Yunxiao, Zhao'an, Dongshan and other counties and Zhangpu County, which was less affected by the disaster, sent support teams led by responsible comrades of the county party committee to the severely affected areas to carry out disaster relief and rescue. The Jinjiang Special Region is drawing a large number of civil construction workers to Xiamen City to participate in post-disaster construction work. Longyan and Nanping Special Regions also transferred a batch of materials urgently needed in the disaster areas to support Xiamen and other disaster areas.

The relevant departments of Fujian Province are currently rapidly organizing manpower and material resources to support the people in the disaster-stricken areas to resettle their lives and restore production. A large number of production and living materials are being shipped to the disaster areas. In addition to allocating relief funds and funds to support production in the disaster areas of 2 million yuan, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, the Provincial People's Bank also issued a large number of agricultural loans. The Provincial Department of Commerce, the Forestry Department, and other departments allocated a large number of timber, bamboo, sack, chemical fertilizer, cloth, as well as cement, iron wire, Yuan nails, firewood, and other materials to support the disaster areas to repair embankments, repair houses and restore production.

A consolation group led by Wei Jinshui, Liu Yongsheng and other heads of party and government departments is currently going deep into the disaster areas to express condolences, and to lead and organize the masses to quickly restore production and life order.

    接连抗击两次强台风袭击  力争减少损失  力争夺回损失
    福建人民英勇奋战台灾
    各级党委深入抗灾前线抓紧恢复生产和安排受灾群众生活
    新华社福州31日电　在中共福建省委的坚强领导下，广大群众奋勇搏斗，福建人民战胜了十二级强台风，取得了抗风斗争的重大胜利。
    从8月28日开始，来自太平洋的强台风，即波及到福建沿海各地，到8月30日十三时，十二级以上的强台风中心从莆田县登陆。台风登陆前后沿海各地风力都在十级到十二级以上，经全省数百万抗风大军英勇顽强的抗击，终于战胜了解放后少有的强台风的袭击。由于事前准备充分，抗风组织严密，行动十分迅速，大大减轻了台风造成的灾害，保证了人民生命财产的安全。到30日夜晚不完全统计：共死亡居民三人，伤五十七人，下落不明六人，倒塌房屋七百七十四间，损坏七千七百八十四间，船只漂失和未进港的四十三条，遭受损失的甘薯、甘蔗、黄麻等农作物共十五万三千多亩，果树被刮倒和刮断四万五千多株，落果一万一千多吨。
    这次抗击强台风的斗争中，充分显示了各地人民公社的强大威力。在台风袭击之前，各地人民公社在各级党政干部的参加和驻军等支援下，以公社或生产队为单位，火速组织起数百万人的抗风大军，组成抢险队、巡逻队、加固防堤队等，分片分线负责到底，并迅速备好大批抗风抢险物资。在抗风激战中，各地很快抢修了海堤三百五十多公里，及时转移了住在危险地带和危险房屋里的居民五万多户，保卫了各个重要仓库、基本建设工地和工厂，抢收了大批已成熟的黄麻、花生和龙眼等。在各公社及时通知和组织下，出海的渔民绝大部分都在台风到来之前，安全返回大陆。沿海大小船只，基本上都及早进入避风港和拖上岸来。
    在强台风侵袭期间，各级党政干部都和公社干部一起深入到第一线，进行指挥和同群众并肩战斗。宁德县三都公社在三十多个干部带领下，各大队在一两个小时里便组织三千三百多人的抢险队，守卫着三个水库，到风力逐渐增强到十二级以上，暴雨倾盆，每小时降雨量达一百五十毫米，公社又迅速调集了两千多人的抢险队，参加抢修堤岸。平潭县各公社根据海堤上风力最猛，以青年为主组织了三千多人的护堤大军，青年社员们在党委和公社干部带领下，昼夜不停地加固海堤，在很短时间里，就冒着风雨抢修好五百七十九条海堤，使全县海堤安度了强台风和暴雨的险期，保卫了各公社大片农作物的安全。福州市郊鼓山公社更发挥了工农商学兵并肩协作战胜自然灾害的巨大力量。这个社鼓山农具厂的职工们为了支援各生产大队抗灾需要，连夜赶制了大批铁钉；公社商业部门也千方百计地准备了木材、火油、电池等物资供应各方面抢险急需。公社医疗部门组织八十个医务人员，分别设立了三十个抗风急救站，并把事先训练好的一百三十五个急救员，全部配备了急救箱，做到了在抗风中每个大队都有医生，每个生产队有急救员。各生产队的民兵队伍更是修堤抢险中的骨干，他们担任了保卫和加固全社范围内的江堤的险要地段。
    强台风过后又带来了暴雨，全省四百万抗风大军，现在正全面转入抗暴雨和山洪斗争。中共福建省委昨晚开会研究了加强防风防洪工作之后，又在今晚召开了生产抗灾电话会议布置继续抗灾和9、10月份工作，号召各地要做到水利损坏一处就修两处，渔船损失一条就新制两条，继续日夜加高加固海堤江堤和水库等水利工程，以保证居民生命财产的安全和做好以后的生产救灾工作。战胜台风袭击的福建人民，又在和暴雨搏斗。同时迅速组织恢复正常和处理善后工作。各地党委和人民公社都及时安排了受灾群众的吃、住、穿等生活问题，对伤者的治疗和死者的安葬都在妥善安置，并组织力量抢收成熟的受灾中稻、黄麻、花生和水果等。对受灾的晚稻、甘薯、甘蔗和蔬菜等进行补苗扶苗、培土、追肥，促其迅速转机成长。渔区则抓紧进行修场补网以便台风和暴雨平息后迅速出海生产。
    新华社福州31日电　福建省南部8月23日遭受台风灾害地区的广大工农群众，在各级党组织的领导下，以冲天的干劲积极抗灾和恢复生产。
    连日来，海澄、龙溪、漳浦和漳州等地，经常有二十多万人投入救灾和恢复生产工作，龙溪、海澄等县沿海地区被冲破的堤岸大部已被抢堵起来和进行了加固。各地受淹农作物已基本排水、洗苗完毕。各地还抢收龙眼、香蕉、柚子等落果三万二千多担，大批倒伏的果树已被扶正，扶起甘蔗一万一千多亩。
    8月23日从福建南部厦门、海澄、龙溪等地沿海登陆的十二级强台风，是几十年来所少见的。在台风到来之前，福建省和闽南沿海各地的党政领导部门都及早领导群众进行防御，减少一些损失，但由于风力过大、来得极快，来势很猛，虽然作了必要的准备，但在不可抗拒的情况下，仍遭受严重损失。据进一步查明：共死亡七百二十人，受伤六百一十八人，下落不明的九百九十六人。各受灾地区房屋被毁坏的十分严重，龙溪县和漳州市等地倒塌房屋五千三百九十七间，损坏的二万三千一百零六间。厦门市和海澄县倒塌和损坏的房屋达80％到90％。龙溪、海澄和漳浦等地沿海许多地段的海堤决口，大片农田、盐田等都被冲毁。各地在暴风雨中沉没和损坏大小船只达三千四百多只，被漂走的二百八十七只。各地家禽、家畜损失也不少。灾情发生后，各地党政采取善后措施，一星期来生产和生活秩序已逐步恢复。
    厦门市和漳州市各工厂和基本建设工地的工人，克服了各种困难，迅速恢复生产，决心夺取8、9月份高产。厦门市、漳州市受灾后的各个工厂和手工业社的工人，一面抢修工棚、一面在食堂宿舍或露天里继续生产。九个竹器生产合作社不但自己很快恢复了生产，而且把整个行业的工人和家属集中起来，赶制竹篷，支援各工厂和农村，加速恢复生产。
    各地人民公社在领导和组织抗灾、救灾斗争中，发挥了巨大威力，龙溪县在中共龙溪县委会的统一领导下，各公社迅速掀起一个十万人以救灾、恢复生产为中心的大生产运动，决心把被台风夺走的东西再夺回来。各公社党委书记、委员等负责干部都分别深入各生产队和群众一起战斗。这个县的重灾区角尾公社在公社统一组织下，连日出动了一万多人，日夜抢修堤岸和抢救农作物。
    全省非灾区的群众发扬了大协作的精神，在人力、物力上大力支援灾区人民。平和、南靖、云霄、诏安、东山等县和受灾较轻的漳浦县，都由县委负责同志亲自率领支援队伍，赶往重灾区进行抗灾抢险。晋江专区正在抽调大批土木工人赶到厦门市参加灾后的修建工作。龙岩、南平两专区也调出一批灾区迫切需要的物资支援厦门等灾区。
    福建省各有关部门，目前正迅速组织人力物力，支援各地受灾区人民安置生活和恢复生产。大批生产和生活资料源源运往灾区。省委和省人民委员会除拨出救济款和支援灾区生产的资金二百万元，省人民银行还发放大批农贷，省商业厅、林业厅等部门调拨了大批木材、毛竹、麻袋、化学肥料、布匹以及水泥、铁丝、元钉、柴火等物资，支援各灾区抢修堤坝修缮房屋和恢复生产。
    由党政部门的负责人魏金水、刘永生等率领的慰问团目前深入灾区进行慰问，和领导组织群众迅速恢复生产和生活秩序。
