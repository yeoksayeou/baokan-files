    The Winter Wheat Area in Huaiyin City Expanded by One-Third.
    150,000 Laborers and 30,000 Teams of Oxen in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, Involved in the Deep Plowing Campaign.
    This newspaper reports: Correctly analyzing the current production situation and fully leveraging the superiority of the People's Commune, Huaiyin City, Jiangsu Province, has decided to expand the winter wheat planting area by one-third compared to last year. By August 22nd, all 400,000 mu of early and mid-season wheat fields in the city's suburbs had been plowed, a month ahead of last year. Currently, farmers are working intensively to accumulate and transport fertilizer, striving to complete sowing five days before the Autumn Equinox.
    Before deciding to engage in large-scale deep plowing of wheat fields, the Huaiyin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China led farmers throughout the city in analyzing the current production situation and discussing whether or not to engage in large-scale deep plowing. During the discussion, everyone used many examples to prove that the rural production situation has been getting better and better since communization. In the first year of communization – the autumn of 1958 – they engaged in large-scale deep plowing of wheat fields, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest of the three wheat crops this year. One large area of land in the Qianjin Brigade of the Yugou Commune previously yielded 120 jin of the three wheat crops per mu; after large-scale deep plowing, this year's wheat yield was 350 jin per mu. The increase in yield was even greater after deep plowing of saline-alkali land. Many saline-alkali lands in the Zhiju Commune previously only yielded 60 jin of wheat per mu; after deep plowing, the yield was 420 jin per mu. Therefore, everyone said that after communization, we have the opportunity to better utilize the land, and by firmly grasping deep plowing, we can greatly increase production.
    So, can we deep plow? They also conducted a specific analysis. They believe that after communization, this year's various productions have taken the initiative. Corn was planted early, harvested early, and the stubble was cleared early, leaving time for deep plowing. The current mid- and late-autumn field management is already on track, basically achieving weed-free and pest-free conditions; coupled with the large-scale basic construction of water conservancy projects after communization, there are no difficulties in terms of irrigation. The draft cattle are also fatter and stronger than in previous years, generally with 80% to 90% of their fat. In addition, the conditions for tool preparation, plowing techniques, and labor management are all very good. Therefore, we can adopt the approach of "grasping the present with one hand and the future with the other," and while focusing on field management, we can engage in large-scale deep plowing of wheat fields.
    After affirming that we can engage in large-scale deep plowing, the Huaiyin Municipal Committee further led the farmers in discussing when is the best time to deep plow? Everyone said that early plowing and early sowing are better than late plowing and late sowing. A large area of wheat fields in the Lianghuai Brigade of the Wangxing Commune, because deep plowing was done at different times, the growth situation was also in line with the deep plowing – the earlier it was plowed, the better it grew; the later it was plowed, the worse it grew. Corn, sweet potatoes, and other crops that were planted earlier also grew much better than those that were planted later. Therefore, they said: "Agricultural work is one after another, early is better in every way, especially with the high temperatures this summer, early plowing will bring greater benefits."
    In the spirit of great effort and seizing every second, the city formulated a plan for deep plowing of wheat fields. It required all 400,000 mu of early and mid-season wheat fields to be initially plowed by August 25th, with 35% being manually deep dug. Because ideological work was done in advance, the plan was quickly implemented to the teams, and the deep plowing campaign immediately unfolded.
    During the deep plowing campaign, the people of Huaiyin City fully leveraged the superiority of the People's Commune. First, it improved the attendance rate. Due to the implementation of the principle of distribution according to work and the implementation of the system of rewarding over-quota production, coupled with political and ideological education, the attendance rate in many places reached 100%. Second, labor was rationally arranged. Communes such as Haiming, Sanlin, Yugou, Xindu, Chenji, and Wenke all, based on their local conditions, assigned 50% of the labor force to be responsible for autumn harvest and field management, and 50% of the labor force to participate in deep plowing. Third, there was a general mobilization of deep plowing tools, and forces were organized for a major assault. The Haiming Commune organized an assault week, enabling manual digging, machine plowing, multiple plowing, double-blade plows, and deep plows to advance simultaneously. Fourth, large-scale cooperation was organized as needed and where possible. In the deep plowing work in Huaiyin City, in addition to adopting the methods of contracting work to households, assigning responsibilities to individuals, and small collective battles, large-scale operations by large forces were also appropriately adopted. Because they implemented the principle of equal exchange, and the work was divided into ridges and rows, with responsibilities assigned to individuals, and a system of inspection, acceptance, and rewarding over-quota production was implemented, the results were very good. The Xinmin Brigade of the Yugou Commune worked alone, averaging 2.5 fen dug per person per day; in large-scale operations, the average was 4.5 fen dug per person per day.
    Due to the full leveraging of the superiority of the People's Commune, the deep plowing work in Huaiyin City achieved unprecedented results. First, it was manifested in the resolute implementation of the national plan, expanding the planting area of the three wheat crops from 430,000 mu last year to 620,000 mu. Second, the speed of deep plowing was accelerated. Last year, deep plowing work started in late August and only plowed 320,000 mu by late September. This year, starting in mid-August, all 400,000 mu of early and mid-season wheat fields had been plowed by August 22nd, completing the work more than a month ahead of last year. Third, high-yield plots were cultivated. A total of 100,000 mu of high-yield fields were cultivated throughout the city, all of which were manually deep plowed, striving for six plowings before sowing. Fourth, attention was paid to eliminating third-class fields from the beginning.汤集 Tangji and other communes had a lot of saline-alkali land, so they focused on digging the saline-alkali land to a depth of more than 1.2 chi.
    Currently, in addition to vigorously fighting drought and strengthening field management and planting late autumn crops, farmers in Huaiyin City are actively organizing forces to carry out more plowing and deep plowing. Those that have been deep plowed should be shallowly plowed again; those that have been stubble-mulched should be deep plowed again. At the same time, specialized forces are being organized to accumulate and transport fertilizer. Fertilizer plans have been implemented to households and fields. Generally, basic fields are required to have 50 dan of refined fertilizer and 200 dan of coarse fertilizer; general fields are required to have 15 dan of refined fertilizer and 100 dan of coarse fertilizer per mu. The city also plans to plant 130,000 mu of green manure, which has now been implemented to the fields and will be sown soon. Recently, Party committees at all levels in Huaiyin City are leading farmers in discussing the standards for autumn sowing and studying how to ensure that early-season wheat is planted well five days before the Autumn Equinox.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: According to the spirit of grasping early and doing well, Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, has launched a mass upsurge of deep plowing land throughout the county.
    Zaoyang County in Hubei Province is famous for its wheat production. According to years of experience, especially the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, one of the keys to high wheat yield is to plant well, and planting well is most important for deep plowing the land.
    Currently, 150,000 laborers and 30,000 teams of oxen throughout the county are involved in deep plowing. Now the fields are full of red flags and everywhere is bustling with activity and soaring enthusiasm. As of August 29th, the county had deep plowed 250,000 mu, of which 60% of the cultivated layer was above 8 cun. The farmers throughout the county are determined to strive to complete the deep plowing of all 1.1 million mu of wheat land before September 20th.
    The deep plowing campaign in Zaoyang County is being carried out in the context of an unusually severe drought. However, despite the drought bringing many difficulties to deep plowing, the people who are determined to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year have expressed such determination: We will deep plow when it rains, and we will deep plow even if it doesn't rain; we will deep plow where there are many draft cattle, and we will deep plow where there are few draft cattle; we will deep plow river land "plains," and we will deep plow hilly land. In order to do a good job in deep plowing, in addition to concentrating more than 60% of the labor force on deep plowing, the county has also transferred more than 18,000 cadres to lead this campaign. At the same time, every Party member, League member, and cadre has engaged in experimental fields from the beginning of deep plowing. In order to ensure the quality of large-scale deep plowing, each commune has adopted the method of fixed leadership, fixed teams, dividing war zones, and operating separately, engaging in large-scale competitions, evaluations, and inspections, so that not only are the fields by the roadside deep plowed well, but remote areas are also deep plowed very well.
    In deep plowing the land, Zaoyang County mainly uses multiple plows, modified double-blade plows, and mattocks. And it has also promoted the production responsibility system with the content of group contracting and recording points per mu. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee attach great importance to the experience of Zaoyang County in deep plowing the land. The Xiangyang Prefectural Committee held an on-site meeting here on August 30th to promote their experience, requiring a rapid upsurge in deep plowing throughout the prefecture.

    提前完成麦地深翻　组织力量积肥运肥　保证适时播下良种
    淮阴市冬麦面积扩大三分之一
    湖北枣阳十五万劳力三万犋耕牛投入深翻地运动
    本报讯　正确分析当前生产形势，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，江苏省淮阴市决定冬麦播种面积比去年扩大三分之一。到8月22日止，全市郊区四十万亩早、中茬麦田已经全部翻好，比去年提早一个月。目前，农民正紧张地积肥、运肥，力争在秋分前五天完成播种工作。
    在决定大搞麦田深翻之前，中共淮阴市委曾领导全市农民分析当前生产形势，讨论要不要大搞深翻。在讨论中，大家用许多事例证明，公社化以后使农村生产形势越来越好。公社化的第一年——1958年秋天，他们大搞麦田深翻，使今年的三麦获得了空前未有的丰收。渔沟公社前进大队有一大片土地，往年亩产三麦为一百二十斤，大搞深翻以后，今年亩产麦子三百五十斤。沙碱地深翻以后，增产幅度更大。志举公社很多沙碱地往年每亩只产麦子六十斤，深翻以后亩产麦四百二十斤。因此，大家都说，公社化以后，我们有可能更好地利用土地，紧紧抓住深翻，就能够大大增产。
    那么，能不能够深翻呢？他们也进行了具体分析。认为公社化以后，今年的各项生产都已取得了主动。玉米播种早、收割早、茬口腾的早，有时间深翻。当前中、晚秋田间管理已经上路，基本上做到无草无虫；加上公社化后大干水利基本建设，灌溉方面也无困难。耕牛也比往年肥壮，一般都有八、九成膘。此外，工具准备、耕翻技术、以及劳动管理等方面，条件也都很好。因此可以采取“一手抓当前、一手抓明年”的做法，在大抓田间管理的同时，大搞麦田深翻。
    在肯定了能够大搞深翻以后，淮阴市委又进一步领导农民讨论什么时候深翻好？大家都说，早翻早播比迟翻迟播好。王兴公社两淮大队有一大块麦田，因为深翻有先有后，结果生长情况也和深翻一样，先翻的长的好，后翻的长的差。玉米、山芋等先播先栽的也比后播后栽的好得多。因此，他们说：“农活一项接一项，一早百早，一好百好，特别是今夏气温高，早翻会得到更大的好处。”
    本着大鼓干劲、分秒必争的精神，全市制定了麦田深翻规划。要求四十万亩早、中茬麦田全部在8月25日以前初步耕翻好，其中35％是人工深挖。由于事前做好了思想工作，规划很快落实到队，深翻运动马上展开。
    在深翻运动中，淮阴市人民充分发挥了人民公社的优越性。首先是提高了出勤率。由于贯彻了按劳分配的原则和实行超额奖励的制度，再加上政治思想教育，很多地方出勤率达到百分之百。其次是合理安排劳动力。海明、三林、渔沟、新渡、陈集、文科等公社都根据本地实际情况，以50％的劳力负责秋收和田间管理，以50％的劳动力参加深翻。第三是深翻工具总动员，组织力量大突击。海明公社组织了一个突击周，使人挖、机耕、套耕、双铧犁、深耕犁等方法齐头并进。第四，根据需要和可能组织大协作。淮阴市深翻工作中除采取包工到户、责任到人和小集体战斗外，也适当采取了大兵团作战的方法。由于他们贯彻了等价交换的原则，工作中又划畦划行、责任到人，并实行检查验收和超额奖励制度，效果很好。渔沟公社新民大队单独作战，平均每人每天挖两分半；大兵团作战，平均每人每天挖四分半。
    由于充分发挥人民公社优越性，淮阴市麦田深翻工作获得了空前未有的成绩。首先表现在坚决执行国家计划，把三麦播种面积从去年的四十三万亩扩大到六十二万亩。第二，加快了深翻速度。去年深翻工作从8月下旬开始，到9月下旬才深翻三十二万亩。今年从8月中旬开始，到8月22日已把四十万亩早中茬麦田全部耕翻好。比去年提前一个多月完成。第三，培养了高产片。全市共培养十万亩高产田，这些地全是人工深翻的，争取六犁下种。第四，一开始就注意消灭三类田。汤集等公社沙碱地多，他们就重点大挖沙碱地，深达一尺二寸以上。
    目前，淮阴市农民除大力抗旱和加强田间管理及播种晚秋外，又积极组织力量进行多耕、深耕。已深耕的还要再浅耕；先灭茬的还要再深耕。同时，又组织专门力量积肥、运肥。肥料规划已经落实到户、到田。一般要求基本田有精肥五十担，粗肥二百担；一般田每亩有精肥十五担，粗肥一百担。全市还规划种植绿肥十三万亩，现已落实到田，即将播种。最近，淮阴市各级党委正领导农民讨论秋播规格问题，并研究怎样保证在秋分前五天种好早茬麦的方法。
    据新华社武汉电　湖北枣阳县根据抓早抓好的精神，在全县范围内掀起了群众性的深翻土地的高潮。
    枣阳县在湖北省以盛产小麦著名。根据历年经验，特别是去年大跃进的经验，小麦丰产的关键之一是种好，而种好又以深翻土地最为重要。
    目前，全县投入深翻地的有十五万劳动大军，三万犋耕牛。现在田野里遍地红旗招展，到处人声鼎沸，干劲冲天。到8月29日止，全县已深耕二十五万亩，其中60％耕层都在八寸以上。全县农民决心争取在9月20日以前将一百一十万亩小麦地全部深翻完。
    枣阳县深翻土地的运动是在异常干旱的情况下进行的。但是，尽管干旱给深翻土地带来了许多困难，决心争取明年小麦丰收的人们，却表示了这样的决心：天下雨要深翻，天不下雨也要深翻；耕牛多的地方要深翻，耕牛少的地方也要深翻；河地“平原”要深翻，岗地也要深翻。为了搞好深翻工作，全县除集中了60％以上的劳动力深翻土地以外，还抽调了一万八千多名干部领导这一运动。同时，每个党、团员、干部从深耕开始就搞了试验田。为了保证大面积深翻质量，各公社采取了固定领导、固定班子、划分战区、分头作战的方法，大搞竞赛、评比、检查，这样不仅使路边的田深翻得好，边远地区也深翻很好。
    枣阳县在深翻土地中主要用套犁、改制的双铧犁以及镢头进行深翻。并且还推行了小组承包，按亩记分等为内容的生产责任制。中共湖北省委、襄阳地委对枣阳县深翻土地的经验极为重视。襄阳地委8月30日在这里召开现场会，推广他们的经验，要求在全专区范围内迅速掀起一个深翻土地的高潮。
