Dear Comrades,

On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the overthrow of the rule of the imperialists and domestic reactionaries, and the establishment of the people's political power and a new democratic system, the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran extends its heartfelt congratulations in its own name and in the name of the entire Iranian people. The great significance of the Chinese people's revolution in human history is now clearer than ever. It is the most significant event in the entire history of mankind since the great Russian October Socialist Revolution. Because it took place in a semi-colonial country, it has had a significant impact on the development of the national liberation movements of the oppressed nations of Asia and Africa, and its significance is even greater.

The Chinese revolution, victoriously completed by the Chinese Communist Party, headed by the outstanding Marxist theorist Comrade Mao Zedong, with rich experience in struggle, has enabled the great people to give full play to their creativity and achieve great achievements in the economic and cultural fields. The various ethnic groups in China have established close brotherly friendship. In the short historical period of ten years, New China has made extremely great achievements in the struggle to strengthen its political and economic independence and in the struggle for universal prosperity and progress. Through the example of your great country, the principles of Marxism-Leninism have once again brilliantly demonstrated their vitality. Now, the People's Republic of China is defending world peace, and no direct or indirect conspiracies of imperialism can shake its power. The day is not far off when the People's Republic of China will occupy its rightful seat in the United Nations, which is now illegally occupied by the imposter Chiang Kai-shek elements, and play its due role in this organization.

The victories achieved by the Chinese people in building a new economy, the extensive and in-depth movement to transform agriculture, and the progress in culture have made the people of our country feel happy and encouraged, because the fate of our people is similar in many respects to the fate of pre-revolutionary China. The people of all ethnic groups in our country clearly know that the strengthening of the socialist camp will shorten their path to liberation.

Now in our country, the reign of terror of the Mohammad Reza monarchy fascist regime is very rampant. Our people and our party are in the most difficult days in history. But our people and our party are determined to continue the struggle until complete victory is achieved. The victory of socialism on a world scale and the achievements of the Chinese people encourage us to carry out our own struggle.

Dear Comrades, please allow us to once again congratulate you on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We believe that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will not only be able to complete the current long-term plan—to catch up with and surpass Britain in the next few years—but also the day is not far off when the People's Republic of China will become a world-class power with a highly developed and strong economy.

Dear Comrades, please accept our fraternal greetings.

              First Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran: Radmanesh
                                        Secretary: Eskandari (with picture)

### 伊朗人民党中央执行委员会委员、伊朗人民党代表团团长  塔巴里同志宣读伊朗人民党的贺词

    伊朗人民党中央执行委员会委员、伊朗人民党代表团团长
    塔巴里同志宣读伊朗人民党的贺词亲爱的同志们：
    伟大的中国人民在中国共产党的英明领导下取得了解放斗争的胜利，推翻了帝国主义者和国内反动派的统治，建立了人民的政权和新的民主制度，值此中国人民胜利的十周年，伊朗人民党中央委员会以自己的名义和全体伊朗人民的名义表示衷心的祝贺。中国人民革命在人类历史上的伟大意义现在比过去任何时候都更加清楚了。它是在伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命以后整个人类历史上的最重大的事件。由于它是发生在一个半殖民地的国家，对亚洲和非洲被压迫民族的民族解放运动的发展产生了重大的影响，因此它的意义就更加伟大。
    以杰出的马克思主义理论家毛泽东同志为首的、富有斗争经验的中国共产党所胜利完成的中国革命，使伟大的人民充分发挥了创造力，在经济和文化方面取得伟大的成就。中国国内各民族已经建立了紧密的兄弟般的友谊。在十年这个短短的历史时期内，新中国在加强自己的政治独立和经济独立的斗争中、在争取普遍富裕和进步的斗争中取得了极其伟大的成就。通过你们这个伟大国家的实例，马克思列宁主义的原则又一次光辉地证明了自己的生命力，现在中华人民共和国正在保卫着全世界的和平，帝国主义的任何直接的间接的阴谋诡计都不能动摇它的威力。中华人民共和国在联合国内占据应有的、而现在被冒名顶替的蒋介石分子非法占据的席位，并在这个组织中起它所应起的作用的日子已经为期不远了。
    中国人民在建设新经济方面所取得的胜利。广泛而深入地展开的改造农业的运动和文化的进步，使我国人民感到欢欣鼓舞，因为我国人民的命运同革命前中国的命运在许多方面是相似的。我国各族人民清楚地知道，社会主义阵营的增强会缩短他们走向解放的路程。
    现在在我们国内，穆罕默德·礼萨君主法西斯制度的恐怖统治非常猖獗。我国人民和我们党正处于历史上最艰难的日子。但是我国人民和我们党有决心斗争下去，直到取得完全的胜利。社会主义在世界范围的胜利和中国人民的成就鼓舞我们去进行自己的斗争。
    亲爱的同志们：请允许我们再一次向你们祝贺中华人民共和国建国十周年。我们相信，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下不仅能够完成目前的远景计划——在最近几年内赶上并超过英国，而且中华人民共和国，作为一个拥有高度发达的强大的经济的世界头等强国的日子已经为期不远了。
    亲爱的同志们：请接受我们兄弟般的敬礼。
              伊朗人民党中央委员会第一书记：拉德马内什
                                        书记：爱斯刚德里（附图片）
