The great 10th anniversary of the National Day is approaching! All the staff and workers on our mechanical industry front, together with the people of the whole country, are warmly responding to the Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee's call to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and are celebrating this victorious festival with even greater achievements in production and construction.

In the past ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved historically significant victories in the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. This is the victory of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism closely integrated with the Chinese reality. This is the victory of the Party's General Line. The construction and development of China's mechanical industry, like all other construction undertakings, has unswervingly implemented the Party's General Line. With the support of the people of the whole country and all brother departments, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, through the efforts of all the staff and workers in the mechanical industry, China's mechanical industry has basically formed a complete system.

Ten years of great achievements, especially the Great Leap Forward in 1958, have enabled the mechanical industry to basically form a complete system

After three years of recovery, China's mechanical industry entered a period of planned construction. During the First Five-Year Plan, we built and rebuilt many backbone enterprises necessary for national industrialization, and carried out a series of consolidations and technological transformations of the original state-owned enterprises; at the same time, we carried out socialist transformation of private enterprises; thus, we laid the initial foundation for China's modern mechanical industry. Since 1958, we have resolutely implemented the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, as well as a whole set of policies of walking on two legs, realizing an unprecedented Great Leap Forward, and pushing the mechanical industry to a higher stage of development.

China's mechanical industry has built a manufacturing industry with complete sectors and world-class levels. It has dozens of manufacturing sectors that never existed in the past, such as metallurgical equipment manufacturing, power generation equipment manufacturing, mining equipment manufacturing, oil refining and chemical equipment manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, radio manufacturing, locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, shipbuilding, tractor and agricultural machinery manufacturing, power machinery manufacturing, machine tool and tool manufacturing, precision instrument manufacturing, bearing manufacturing, textile machinery and light industrial machinery manufacturing, and other machinery manufacturing, etc. While building modern backbone enterprises of the mechanical industry, tens of thousands of medium and small-sized enterprises have been established throughout the country, forming a dotted mechanical industry network combining large enterprises with medium and small-sized enterprises, which has greatly improved the distribution of the mechanical industry and rapidly improved the production capacity of the mechanical industry.

China's mechanical industry has completed the transition from repair and assembly to manufacturing, and has entered the stage of being able to manufacture major, precision, and cutting-edge machinery and equipment from the manufacturing of general machinery and equipment. Now we have manufactured primary rolling mills with a roll diameter of 750 mm, 2,500-ton free forging hydraulic presses, large blast furnaces with a volume of 1,513 cubic meters, 50,000 kW steam turbine generator sets, 72,500 kW hydro-turbine generator sets, and high-precision coordinate boring machines, etc. At the same time, modern jet aircraft, various types of automobiles, electric locomotives, diesel locomotives, 5,000-ton coastal freighters, various tractors, new types of radio and electronic equipment, and modern national defense equipment have also been successfully trial-produced and put into production.

The transition from imitation to independent design is a technological leap in China's mechanical industry in recent years. Now we can not only design general machine products, but also design 10,000-ton ocean freighters, new locomotives, automobiles, airplanes, 12,500-ton free forging hydraulic presses, 1,150 mm diameter primary rolling mills, and other major and cutting-edge products. This marks that China's mechanical industry has entered the field of advanced world technology.

Another sign of the high-speed development of the mechanical industry is that the self-sufficiency rate of China's machinery and equipment has been greatly improved. During the First Five-Year Plan, many large and precision machinery and equipment could not be manufactured domestically, and many of the machinery and equipment required for construction relied on imports. In the five years, the highest self-sufficiency rate was only about 60%. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the self-sufficiency rate increased to 78%, and it is expected to reach more than 80% this year. That is to say, in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, we completed ahead of schedule the task proposed by the Party's Eighth National Congress to increase the self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment to about 70% in 1962. It should be particularly pointed out that the main complete sets of equipment, such as metallurgy, power stations, and other heavy machinery, have begun to shift from foreign complete supply to domestic complete supply, which is a major change in China's mechanical industry.

In the past ten years, the scientific research and education of the mechanical industry have made great progress. More than 80 scientific research and product design institutions have been established; more than a dozen factory design institutions; and hundreds of higher education institutions, secondary technical schools, and technical worker schools have been established. Most enterprises have also established experimental research and employee education institutions. With such technical backing and reserve forces, important conditions have been provided for the continuous development of the production technology of the mechanical industry.

The high-speed development of the production and construction of the mechanical industry is inseparable from the continuous growth and expansion of its team. The total number of employees in mechanical enterprises above the county level has increased from more than 300,000 in 1949 to more than 3 million in 1958. Under the leadership and education of the Party, all employees have undergone practical tests and training in various political movements, especially the rectification movement, the anti-rightist struggle, and the Great Leap Forward, and their political and ideological level, technical level, and cultural level have been greatly improved. The infinite wisdom and strength hidden in the broad masses of employees have been greatly brought into play in the cause of socialist construction. This is an important guarantee for the continuous leap forward of the mechanical industry.

All these changes and the great achievements that have been made mark that China's mechanical industry has entered a higher stage of development and has basically formed a complete mechanical industry system. This provides a material guarantee for China's national industrialization, agricultural mechanization, electrification, and national defense modernization.

The reason why we were able to form a complete mechanical industry system in just ten years is that the Great Leap Forward in 1958 played a major role. During the First Five-Year Plan, the average annual growth rate of the mechanical industry was 30%. The highest growth rate in the five years was 61% in 1956. It should be said that this was already a very fast development speed. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, it increased by 1.6 times in one year, which is equivalent to more than five times the average annual growth rate in the previous five years, and equivalent to two and a half times the growth rate in 1956. The output of all products has also increased sharply. For example, metallurgical equipment increased by seven times in 1958 compared with 1957, which is more than twice the total output during the First Five-Year Plan; power station equipment increased by three times in 1958 compared with 1957, which is more than 63% more than the total output during the First Five-Year Plan. The output of other products has also doubled. The high-speed development of the mechanical industry has significantly increased its proportion in the entire industry. The great practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 has further enriched our construction experience and opened up a broad road for the continued Great Leap Forward of the mechanical industry.

On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 has also achieved great results. As of the end of August, the output of metallurgical equipment reached 132,000 tons, which has far exceeded the original target of 30,000 to 40,000 tons to be reached in 1962; the output of cement equipment reached more than 10,000 tons, overfulfilling the original target of 9,000 tons to be reached in 1962; the output of power machinery reached 2.52 million horsepower, exceeding the original target of 1.7 million horsepower to be reached in 1962. The output of other products, such as power generation equipment, metal cutting machine tools, and paper making equipment, will also reach and exceed the original targets set for the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Completing the five-year plan targets in two years is a heart-stirring and world-shaking event.

The high-speed development of China's mechanical industry is not only incomparable to the old China, but also far beyond the reach of any capitalist country in the world. From 1949 to 1958, the total output value of China's mechanical industry increased by nearly 40 times, while the mechanical industries of the United States and Britain increased by only about 50% in roughly the same period. Taking the output of metal cutting machine tools as an example, China's output in 1958 was 50,000 units (excluding simple machine tools), an increase of 79% over 1957; while the United Kingdom, which has a history of more than 100 years in producing metal cutting machine tools, produced only about 60,000 units in 1958. This fact of the high-speed development of China's mechanical industry has powerfully shattered the various slanders of hostile elements at home and abroad and proved the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. We firmly believe that in about ten years, we will catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products.

The mass movement, the combination of large, medium, and small-sized enterprises, has greatly accelerated the development of the mechanical industry

In 1958, under the guidance of the Party’s General Line for building socialism, the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the simultaneous development of central industry and local industry, the simultaneous development of large and small enterprises, and the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, a vigorous mass movement to run industry by the whole people was launched across the country. In this mass movement, the mechanical industry built and expanded 220 large backbone enterprises on the one hand, and built tens of thousands of medium and small enterprises on the other hand. Provinces, cities, autonomous regions, special districts, counties, and people's communes all set up mechanical manufacturing and repair enterprises. Many places that could not manufacture machines in the past can now manufacture them, and a moving scene of factories all over the countryside and machines ringing everywhere has appeared. During the First Five-Year Plan, the regions that produced power generation equipment were mainly Shanghai and Harbin, and only a very few enterprises produced automobiles and tractors. Now, 15 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions produce power generation equipment, and more than a dozen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have successfully trial-produced or produced various automobiles and tractors. As for metallurgical equipment, motors, machine tools, power machinery, agricultural machinery, and ball bearings, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions can manufacture them. The policy of walking on two legs, like nuclear fission, has generated enormous power and brought an unprecedentedly vigorous new atmosphere to the mechanical industry.

The result of running industry by the whole people and the large-scale construction of medium and small enterprises has further improved the distribution of China's mechanical industry. The foundation of the mechanical industry was extremely weak in the past, and it was concentrated in a few coastal cities, while the vast inland areas had very little, and many areas had almost no mechanical industry. After the construction of the First Five-Year Plan, this unreasonable distribution has been greatly changed. In the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the mechanical industry in coastal cities still had greater development, but the development speed of the mechanical industry in the inland areas also increased even more. For example, the proportion of mechanical industry enterprises distributed in the inland areas increased from 25% in 1955 to 51% in 1958; the proportion of the number of employees in the inland mechanical industry to the total number of employees in the national mechanical industry increased from 33% in 1955 to 48% in 1958; the proportion of the output of metal cutting machine tools in the inland areas to the total output of machine tools in the country increased from 11% in 1955 to 32% in 1958. Areas that had almost no mechanical industry in the past, especially minority areas, now have mechanical industry, and they are developing rapidly. For example, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the output value of the mechanical industry increased by more than three times in 1958 compared with 1957; products such as metallurgical equipment, mining equipment, lifting and transportation equipment, metal cutting machine tools, and forging and pressing equipment, which could not be produced in the past, can now be produced. In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the output value of the mechanical industry increased by two times in 1958 compared with 1957; the output of metal cutting machine tools increased by 21 times. In Gansu Province, more than 140 mechanical factories above the county level were established in the Great Leap Forward, and metallurgical equipment, mining equipment, petroleum equipment, machine tools, and power machinery and other products were produced. The above situation fully shows that the regional distribution of the mechanical industry has undergone great changes. A reasonable regional distribution of the mechanical industry helps promote the development of the regional economy.

The widespread development of the mechanical industry has created favorable conditions for the gradual realization of agricultural mechanization. According to incomplete statistics in February this year, people's communes have established more than 80,000 small agricultural tool manufacturing and repair factories, manufacturing a large number of medium and small agricultural tools and processing machinery pulled by humans and animals. A large number of small agricultural tools promoted nationwide last year, such as deep plows, water conservancy construction tools, transportation tools, harvesting and threshing tools, and ball bearings, were produced by newly established agricultural tool manufacturing and repair factories. The manufacture and promotion of these agricultural tools have played an important role in improving agricultural labor productivity.

The large-scale promotion of agricultural machinery, which has enabled farmers who have used backward agricultural tools for thousands of years to get their hands on machines, must be fully evaluated for the great significance of this matter. Through the manufacture of agricultural tools and simple machines, the mysterious view of industrial technology and agricultural mechanization has been broken, and many skilled craftsmen have been cultivated, thereby promoting the development of the rural cultural revolution and technological revolution.

The reason why the policy of walking on two legs can be quickly mastered by the masses and achieve immediate results is that China is a country with a large area, abundant resources, a large population, and is "poor and blank." Socialist construction urgently needs a lot of machinery and equipment; the policy of walking on two legs correctly reflects the urgent wishes and requirements of the people. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Only when China completely completes the socialist transformation in terms of the social and economic system, and also uses machine operations in all departments and places where machine operations can be used, can the social and economic face be completely changed." Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction put forward glorious and great tasks for the mechanical industry and pointed out a clear direction. Building any factory, making steel, mining more coal, generating more electricity, producing more grain and cotton, developing transportation, and producing more daily necessities for the people, etc., all require machines; especially after the people's communes were established, various construction undertakings have developed rapidly, and more machines are needed. In this way, the whole people must be mobilized to build more medium and small mechanical enterprises while building large mechanical enterprises, in order to rapidly increase production capacity and meet various needs as soon as possible.

From the perspective of the characteristics of the mechanical industry itself, it is also necessary to implement the policy of walking on two legs. The product variety and product structure of the mechanical industry are very complex. Products are divided into main bodies, auxiliary machines, and accessories, and often have thousands of parts; enterprises are also divided into manufacturing and repair. At the same time, the parts and components of many products are often not produced in one enterprise, but must be produced in sets by enterprises of various sizes in coordination; with the improvement of specialization and cooperation, this interrelationship will become closer and closer. These characteristics determine that the scale of mechanical industry enterprises needs to be large, medium, and small, and cannot walk on one leg.

The practice of the Great Leap Forward further proves that resolutely implementing the policy of the simultaneous development of central industry and local industry and the simultaneous development of large and small enterprises has greatly accelerated the development of the mechanical industry. The large backbone enterprises of the mechanical industry have been assisted by medium and small enterprises, which is like adding wings to a tiger. They can free up their hands to develop major products and cutting-edge technologies more quickly. Since the Great Leap Forward, the high-speed increase in the output of mechanical industry products, the sharp increase in new products, the strengthening of complete set capabilities, and the growth of technical strength cannot be achieved without large enterprises, and it is also impossible to achieve without the cooperation of medium and small enterprises. The practice of the Great Leap Forward also proves that the development of large, medium, and small enterprises in the mechanical industry, combined with the development of large, medium, and small enterprises in various departments of the national economy, and combined with the development of the people's commune movement, will accelerate the development of China's socialist economic construction cause more quickly. Running industry by the whole people, having factories everywhere, will, as the Party Central Committee has pointed out, inevitably accelerate the process of national industrialization; accelerate the process of agricultural mechanization; and accelerate the process of narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas.

Currently, our important task is to carry out rectification, consolidation, and improvement work on the basis of the Great Leap Forward, according to the spirit of the whole country as a single chess game, make overall plans, strengthen leadership, according to the needs of the entire national economic construction and the specific conditions of each region, pay attention to the layout of the mechanical industry, organize the specialization and cooperation of various sectors of the mechanical industry, and rationally adjust the proportion of manufacturing and repair, so that it can be perfected on a new basis, continue to leap forward, and give fuller play to the great power of running the mechanical industry by the whole people.

We must also adhere to the policy of walking on two legs in the great technological innovation and technological revolution.

Technologically transforming various sectors of the national economy, and gradually transitioning them to a new technological foundation and to the technological foundation of modern large-scale production, is the main task of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party. This task requires the mechanical industry to rapidly improve its technical level and accelerate the provision of more and better technical equipment to various sectors.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the technological development of the mechanical industry has leaped from the level of imitating general products to a new stage of independently designing and manufacturing major and precision products at an unprecedented speed. More than 1,000 types were included in the trial production plan in 1958; as soon as the mass movement started, trial production and tackling cutting-edge technologies were carried out everywhere, greatly exceeding the original plan. Among the successfully trial-produced new products, there are more than 120 types of representative important varieties, most of which are heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products. Many products that were originally planned to be trial-produced in two or three years, or even four or five years, have also been manufactured ahead of schedule. These new products are mostly designed by China itself or designed with reference to foreign technical data. This high-speed leap in the technology of the mechanical industry has certainly been obtained on the basis of the existing foundation and fully absorbing domestic and foreign experience. However, the more important reason is that the Party’s General Line has inspired the enthusiasm of all employees, implemented political command, broken superstitions, promoted a high degree of creative spirit, launched a wide range of technological innovation and technological revolution movements, liberated thinking, and implemented the policy of walking on two legs with both foreign and indigenous methods.

Before the Great Leap Forward, the material and technical foundation and technical level of the mechanical industry were not commensurate with the requirements put forward by various sectors of the national economy during the Great Leap Forward. Many major and precision machinery and equipment could not be produced, and the quantity of varieties that could be produced could not meet the needs. At that time, the task before us was how to fully utilize the existing conditions, rapidly improve the production capacity and technical level, expand output, and increase varieties. If, as some people thought, we waited to build new factories, import equipment from abroad, and then start trial production; or waited until the state had equipped all existing enterprises with modern equipment, and then increased the variety and output of products, it would obviously miss the opportunity.

In this situation, employees sharply raised the question: If we say that we do not have the conditions to manufacture major and precision products, then we cannot produce these products, then where did the world's first heavy equipment come from? How was the first precision machine made? They pointed out the common truth of starting from scratch, from small to large, and from rough to fine, and broke the superstition of conditionalists; with their own practical actions, they tried every means to overcome various difficulties, launched a battle to capture major and precision products, and achieved great achievements. Here, only two examples of enterprises are given. The Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Plant accepted the task of manufacturing large-scale nitrogen fertilizer equipment with 2,400 horsepower; this equipment weighed 182 tons, and the large parts weighed more than 10 tons; in terms of the original processing equipment of this factory, the conditions for producing this equipment were insufficient; however, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of employees, with the spirit of daring to think, dare to say, and dare to do, manufactured seven types of 19 small and medium-sized special machine tools designed by themselves, processed large parts like ants gnawing bones, created conditions, overcame difficulties, and finally manufactured large-scale nitrogen fertilizer equipment and put it into batch production. The Harbin Jilian Machinery Factory, which only had 47 old machine tools, created modular machine tools that could be assembled at will, and used the method of ants gnawing bones to make ball mills with a diameter of four meters, washing machines with a height of four meters, blast furnaces with a volume of 255 cubic meters, cement drying equipment weighing 50 tons, and large sugar-making equipment. During the Great Leap Forward, employees of many enterprises, with this dauntless spirit, fully utilized existing conditions, created many indigenous methods, overcame many difficulties, and manufactured many major and precision machines that had never been made before; and created effective technical experiences such as "turning large into small, combining small into large, replacing casting with forging, replacing iron with steel," and self-made special equipment or simple equipment. The correct application and continuous improvement of these experiences is of great significance not only at present, but also in the future for us to accelerate the mastery of the manufacturing technology of major and precision new products.

The tens of thousands of factories of various types built by the whole people in urban and rural areas need a large number of machinery and equipment, but although the number of metal cutting machine tools (excluding simple machine tools) produced domestically last year increased sharply to 50,000 units, the number that could be allocated to small enterprises was very limited except for equipping large and medium-sized enterprises. In order to equip these enterprises, a mass movement to build indigenous machine tools and simple equipment was launched across the country under the guidance of the policy of walking on two legs with both foreign and indigenous methods, and thousands of simple machines were manufactured, equipping a large number of newly built medium and small enterprises. Using these equipment, combined with foreign equipment, not only produced some machine products needed for local industry, agriculture, transportation, and people's livelihood, but also many factories relied on these indigenous and simple equipment to produce more advanced machines than themselves. In this way, along the path of development from nothing to something and from low to high, their equipment level and technical level are constantly improving.

In this way, the mechanical industry has implemented the policy of walking on two legs with both foreign and indigenous methods. There are both foreign methods and indigenous methods; there are both foreign equipment and indigenous equipment; when the two are combined, the situation of the entire mechanical industry becomes active. Because we have adopted the method of combining foreign and indigenous methods, many major and precision products that were considered impossible to manufacture in the past can now be manufactured; products that could only be manufactured by a few large enterprises in the past can also be manufactured by medium and small enterprises; newly built enterprises and enterprises lacking some key equipment have also quickly armed themselves with indigenous equipment; in this way, the problem of improvement has been solved, and the problem of popularization has also been solved. This method is not only suitable for the current situation in our country and accelerates our process of mastering major and precision products; but also because it contains the valuable experience accumulated by Chinese mechanical workers over a long period of time, it promotes the new and creates better technical experience that combines foreign and indigenous methods, enriching the technical treasure house of China's mechanical industry.

The relationship between learning and creation is also an important issue in the technological development of the mechanical industry, especially in product design work. Combining learning with creation and combining imitation with independent design is another policy of walking on two legs to rapidly improve the technical level of the mechanical industry.

In science and technology, we need to constantly emphasize learning advanced foreign technology, especially Soviet technology. The reason why we quickly completed the transition from repair and assembly to manufacturing is because we absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brother countries through imitation and mastered the technology in a relatively short period of time. This is a very good learning method. Today, we not only have a strong socialist camp, but also have the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, which far surpasses capitalist countries in technology. We can and should fully utilize this favorable condition to directly use their advanced achievements and accelerate our technological development. However, some people turn learning into reliance, do not use their own brains, do not believe in their own creative ability, and do not dare to design independently, which is certainly wrong.

Whether or not we can design independently depends on whether or not we can combine the advanced foreign technology we have learned with the actual conditions of our country and with the manufacturing and use experience of employees. If we learn well and combine well, we can design on our own and creatively deal with the problems encountered in the design. For example, the large blast furnace with a volume of 1,513 cubic meters manufactured last year, as well as the 2,500-ton free forging hydraulic press designed and manufactured independently, are the result of implementing the above principles. The rational simplification and improvement of the structure of old products by many enterprises in 1958 reflects more of the production and use experience of the broad masses of employees.

Some people completely oppose learning and creation and say that the mass innovation movement in 1958 is like wanting to run before learning to walk. This view is wrong. We emphasize learning in order to create; future imitations must also strive to combine with the actual situation and experience of our country and cannot be completely copied. Only those who dare to create can learn seriously; those who do not dare to go beyond the circle of imitation are often satisfied with the status quo and their minds are not liberated, and there is even less talk about creation. Some people seize on some immature or flawed designs in the Great Leap Forward to deny the path of independent design. This is also completely wrong. It should be understood that it is a remarkable achievement that we have changed from not being able to design independently to being able to design independently. As for some designs that are not mature enough, they will inevitably gradually mature through continuous improvement and experimentation.

What attitude to take towards technical specifications, quotas, and other technical documents is also an important issue encountered in the technological development of the mechanical industry. This issue should be treated from two aspects. On the one hand, technical specifications are the crystallization of modern technical development, reflect the experience of millions of people working for a long time, and are necessary technical rules in production; every employee should study them seriously and strictly abide by and implement them in production. The organized production of modern enterprises cannot be without rules, otherwise there will be chaos. On the other hand, no technical specification is absolutely immutable; it must be revised and supplemented with the growth of labor experience and the improvement of technical level, replacing the old with the new and replacing the better with the better. In this way, production technology can be developed rapidly and labor productivity can be continuously improved.

The mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution promotes continuous revolution in technology, and some technical specifications must also be constantly revised and supplemented. During the Great Leap Forward, the masses used thousands of innovation proposals to reform operating methods, reform tools, transform equipment, and even develop to reform the process routes of work sections and workshops and the entire factory design, greatly improving labor productivity and increasing the output per "unit area." Employees of many enterprises have also made reasonable improvements to the structure of old products, improved product performance, and saved man-hours and materials. All of this is the foundation for improving the technical level of the mechanical industry. It should be seen that technology is not a mysterious thing and should be treated with a revolutionary attitude, daring to constantly replace and develop it with the newer experience and achievements of their own labor, rather than, like those conservatives and dogmatists, treating it as an immutable dead thing. We must adhere to the principle of political command and "fully mobilizing the masses and experimenting with everything," carry out mass technological innovation and technological revolution movements, actively organize experiments, and constantly incorporate the innovation proposals that have been verified as qualified into various technical documents.

In the past ten years, especially during the Great Leap Forward, we have found a faster and better way to develop technology on the basis of our existing experience. That is, under the guidance of the Party’s General Line, fully relying on the masses, breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, resolutely implementing the policy of walking on two legs with both foreign and indigenous methods, widely carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements, combining learning with creation, theory with practice, and popularization with improvement, giving full play to the potential of the existing material and technical foundation, and promoting the continuous leap forward of the technical level of the mechanical industry.

Only by launching mass movements can a vigorous situation and solid measures emerge in enterprises

As mentioned above, the great achievements of the mechanical industry over the past ten years and the continuous improvement of enterprise management are inseparable from the continuous launch of mass movements in enterprises. The mass movement of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 was especially different from the mass movements in previous years. It was launched under the encouragement and guidance of the Party’s General Line for building socialism and under the impetus of the people’s commune movement and the mass steelmaking movement. Its depth of mobilizing the masses and the richness of experience are unprecedented. Our enterprises are socialist enterprises and must unswervingly rely on the broad masses of employees, launch mass movements on a large scale, and combine centralized leadership with letting go and mobilizing the masses, replacing the cold and cheerless situation of relying solely on a few people to run industry with revolutionary and vigorous mass movements. This truth has been irrefutably proven by the great practice of the Great Leap Forward.

The vigor of the situation and the solidity of the measures are interconnected and inseparable. Thousands of production and technical keys are broken through by vigorous mass movements, thousands of measures are put forward and implemented by the masses in vigorous movements, and thousands of big-character posters are filled with solid measures. All the Great Leap Forward indicators are difficult to achieve unless they are implemented in vigorous mass movements. Precisely because we want to be solid, we must be vigorous; only with a lively and revolutionary situation can the infinite wisdom of the broad masses be stimulated. It is wrong to use solidity as an excuse not to launch vigorous mass movements; it is also wrong to be satisfied with superficial vigor without seeking solid measures.

There is such a view that modern mechanical enterprises are technically complex and have a fine division of labor, which is different from the countryside; the set of methods for mobilizing the masses in the countryside is not suitable for modern mechanical enterprises. We believe that precisely because the technology is complex and the division of labor is fine, it cannot be monopolized by a few people and it is even more necessary to mobilize the masses; the directly producing employees know best where the key problems in production and technology lie, and only they can best find ways to solve these problems; we have even less reason not to rely on the employees as masters to run our enterprises well. Those who believe that mass movements cannot be launched on a large scale in modern mechanical enterprises should carefully review what Comrade Mao Zedong said to Xinhua News Agency reporters after inspecting the north and south of the Yangtze River in September 1958: "... In some places and some enterprises, the work of mobilizing the masses has not been done well. Mass meetings have not been held, and the tasks, reasons, and methods have not been clearly explained to the masses, and debates have not been launched among the masses. To this day, some of our comrades are unwilling to engage in large-scale mass movements in the industrial field. They say that engaging in mass movements on the industrial front is 'irregular' and demeans it as 'rural style' and 'guerrilla habits.' This is obviously wrong."

The experience of 1958 proves that not only can and should mass movements be launched on a large scale in modern mechanical enterprises, but also brilliant achievements have been made and rich experience has been created. The achievements in production technology, such as the increase in output and quality, the unprecedented expansion of varieties, the leap in technology, the rise in labor productivity, and the large-scale saving of raw materials, are extremely significant. In terms of the experience of mass movements, such as explaining the situation, tasks, policies, and methods to the masses; mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, debate freely, post big-character posters; widely launching socialist labor competitions by adopting methods such as comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced; organizing visits and evaluations, holding on-site meetings; and holding meetings of cadres at several levels, etc. These methods are all effective and should be widely adopted and developed and improved in the future. It should be seen that labor competition is not only a matter of work methods, but also a concrete manifestation of going all out, aiming high, and striving for the upstream in the implementation of the General Line. When carrying out labor competitions, we must implement the General Line of thinking, establish ambitious goals in socialist construction, and strive for high speed. The two participations, one change, and three combinations that have been widely promoted are especially of great significance. After implementing this method, profound changes have taken place in the relationship between people in the enterprise, and the mass foundation of the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party Committee and the employee representative assembly system under the leadership of the Party Committee has been more firmly strengthened, and more concrete implementation methods have been found and implemented in the daily production activities of the workers. On this basis, after continuous enrichment and improvement, the management system of socialist enterprises can gradually become perfect. The significance of this initiative, especially the significance of workers participating in management, should not be underestimated. Some people think that only full-time management plus the mass line is enough, and workers do not need to participate in management. This is an underestimation of the great significance of workers participating in management. If we hold such an attitude, it is impossible to take the mass line well when carrying out full-time management.

In short, we should have a passionate and positive attitude towards launching mass movements like those in 1958 in modern mechanical enterprises.

The movement launched by thousands of people is not embroidery, and the achievements in various aspects cannot be neatly arranged on a line, and it should not be required that it does not produce any shortcomings. The question is what attitude to take towards shortcomings. For example, in terms of quality, although some products once had poor quality, this cannot be used to criticize the mass movement and deny the achievements of the Great Leap Forward. Naturally, the quality of mechanical products is an extremely important issue. Because mechanical products are the production tools and technical equipment of various sectors of the national economy, their quality has a direct impact on the production and construction of various sectors, so we must pay great attention to quality and constantly improve quality. However, the quality issue must be treated comprehensively according to the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, ensuring quality while completing and overfulfilling state plans, and neither should be neglected. The question now is not whether or not to pay attention to product quality, but who to rely on and what path to take to continuously

    十年来的机械工业
    第一机械工业部部长　赵尔陆
    举国欢庆的伟大的国庆十周年到来了！我们机械工业战线上的全体职工同全国人民一起，正在热烈地响应党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的战斗号召，以更加巨大的生产建设成就，来庆祝这一胜利的节日。
    建国十年来，我国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业中，取得了具有历史意义的胜利。这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国实际密切结合的胜利。这是党的总路线的胜利。我国机械工业的建设和发展，同其他一切建设事业一样，始终不渝地贯彻执行着党的总路线。在全国人民和各兄弟部门的支持下，在苏联和其他社会主义国家的援助下，经过机械工业全体职工的努力，我国机械工业基本上形成了完整的体系。
    十年的巨大成就，尤其是一九五八年的大跃进，使机械工业基本上形成了完整的体系
    我国机械工业在经过三年的恢复后，便进入了有计划建设的时期。在第一个五年计划建设中，我们新建和改建了许多国家工业化所必需的骨干企业，对原有的国营企业进行了一系列的整顿和技术改造；与此同时，对私营企业进行了社会主义改造；这样，就奠定了我国现代化机械工业的初步基础。1958年以来，我们坚决地贯彻执行了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，实现了前所未有的大跃进，把机械工业推向了一个更高的发展阶段。
    我国机械工业已经建成了行业齐全并具有世界先进水平的制造业。它拥有几十个过去从来没有过的制造行业，如冶金设备制造业、发电设备制造业、采矿设备制造业、炼油和化工设备制造业、飞机制造业、无线电制造业、机车车辆制造业、汽车制造业、船舶制造业、拖拉机和农业机械制造业、动力机械制造业、机床和工具制造业、精密仪器仪表制造业、轴承制造业、纺织机械和轻工业机械制造业，以及其他机械制造业等等。在建设现代化的机械工业骨干企业的同时，全国各地兴办了数以万计的中小型企业，形成了大型企业同中小型企业相结合的星罗棋布的机械工业网，大大改善了机械工业的分布状况，迅速提高了机械工业的生产能力。
    我国机械工业完成了从修配到制造的过渡，又从制造一般的机器设备开始进入了能够制造重大、精密和尖端机器设备的阶段。现在我们已经制造了轧辊直径为七百五十毫米的初轧机，二千五百吨自由锻造水压机，容积为一千五百一十三立方米的大高炉，五万瓩的汽轮发电机组，七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机组和高级精密的座标搪床，等等。同时，具有现代水平的喷气式飞机、各式汽车、电气机车、内燃机车、载重量五千吨的沿海货轮、各种拖拉机、新型的无线电电子设备以及现代化的国防装备等等，也都已经试制成功和投入生产。
    从仿造到自行设计，是近年来我国机械工业技术上的一个飞跃。现在我们不仅能设计一般的机器产品，而且能设计像万吨远洋货轮、新型机车、汽车、飞机、一万二千五百吨自由锻造水压机、轧辊直径一千一百五十毫米初轧机以及其他重大和尖端的产品了。这就标志着我国机械工业已经进入了世界先进技术的领域。
    机械工业高速度发展的另一标志，是我国机器设备的自给率有了很大的提高。在第一个五年计划期间，许多大型的精密的机器设备，国内都不能够制造，建设所需要的机器设备许多是依靠进口，五年内，自给率最高的年份只达60％左右。大跃进的1958年，自给率就提高到了78％，预计今年可以达到80％以上。这就是说，我们在第二个五年计划的第一年就提前完成了党的八次代表大会所提出的，在1962年使机器设备的自给率提高到70％左右的任务。特别应该指出的是主要成套设备，如冶金、电站以及其他重型机械等，由国外成套供应为主已开始转变为国内成套供应为主，更是我国机械工业的一个重大的变化。
    十年来，机械工业的科学研究和教育事业有了较大的进展。已经建立了八十多个科学研究和产品设计机构；十几个工厂设计机构；并且建立了数以百计的高等院校、中等技术学校和技术工人学校。大多数企业也设立了试验研究和职工教育机构。有了这样的技术后方和后备力量，便为机械工业生产技术的不断发展提供了重要的条件。
    机械工业生产建设事业的高速度发展，是同它的队伍不断地成长壮大分不开的。县以上机械企业的职工总数，从1949年的三十多万人，增长到1958年的三百多万人。在党的领导和教育下，全体职工经过了历次政治运动，特别是经过了整风运动、反右派斗争和大跃进的实际考验和锻炼，政治思想水平、技术水平和文化水平都有了很大的提高。蕴藏在广大职工群众中的无穷的智慧和力量，在社会主义建设事业中得到了极大的发挥。这是机械工业不断跃进的重要保证。
    所有这些变化和已经取得的巨大成就，标志着我国机械工业已经进入了一个更高的发展阶段，基本上形成了完整的机械工业体系。这就为我国国家工业化、农业机械化电气化和国防现代化提供了物质保证。
    我们所以能够在短短的十年里形成完整的机械工业体系，1958年大跃进起着重大的作用。在第一个五年计划期间，机械工业的每年平均发展速度是30％，五年中增长速度最高的1956年是61％。应当说，这已经是发展很快的高速度。而在大跃进的1958年，一年猛增一点六倍，相当于前五年平均每年增长速度的五倍多，相当于1956年增长速度的两倍半。所有的产品的产量也都有猛烈的增长，如冶金设备，1958年比1957年增长了七倍，比第一个五年计划期间的总和还多两倍；电站设备，1958年比1957年增长了三倍，比第一个五年计划期间的总和还多63％。其他产品也都是成倍地增长。机械工业的高速度发展，使它在全部工业中的比重有了显著的提高。1958年大跃进的伟大实践，更加丰富了我们的建设经验，开拓了机械工业继续大跃进的康庄大道。
    在1958年大跃进的基础上，1959年的继续大跃进又取得了巨大的成就。到8月底止，冶金设备的产量达十三万二千吨，已经远远地超过了原定在1962年达到的三至四万吨的指标；水泥设备的产量达一万多吨，超额完成了原定在1962年达到的九千吨的指标；动力机械的产量达二百五十二万马力，超过了原定在1962年达到的一百七十万马力的指标。其他产品的产量，如发电设备、金属切削机床、造纸设备等也将提前三年达到和超过原定在第二个五年计划最后一年达到的指标。两年完成五年计划的指标，这是如何动人心弦、震撼世界的大事。
    我国机械工业的高速度发展，不仅旧中国不能同日而语，有天壤之别，即使世界上任何资本主义国家也是望尘莫及的。从1949年到1958年，我国机械工业总产值增长了近四十倍，而美、英两国的机械工业在大体相当的时期内只增长了50％左右。拿金属切削机床的产量来说，我国1958年的产量是五万台（不包括简易机床），比1957年增长了79％；而生产金属切削机床有一百多年历史的英国，1958年只生产了六万台左右。我国机械工业高速度发展的这一事实，有力地粉碎了国内外敌对分子的各种诬蔑，证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。我们坚信，在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面一定会赶上或者超过英国。
    全民动手，大中小结合，大大地加速了机械工业的发展
    1958年，在党的建设社会主义的总路线和工业与农业同时并举、中央工业与地方工业同时并举、大型企业与中小型企业同时并举以及以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针的指导下，在全国范围内掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的全民大办工业的群众运动。在这个群众运动中，机械工业一方面新建和扩建了二百二十个大型骨干企业，另一方面又建设了数以万计的中小型企业。各省、市、自治区、专区、县以及人民公社都办起了机械制造企业和修理企业。许多原来不能制造机器的地方，现在都能制造了，出现了工厂遍城乡、机器处处响的动人情景。在第一个五年计划期间，生产发电设备的地区主要是上海和哈尔滨，生产汽车和拖拉机的只有极少数企业，而现在已有十五个省、市、自治区生产发电设备，有十几个省、市、自治区已经试制成功或者生产各种汽车和拖拉机了。至于冶金设备、电动机、机床、动力机械、农业机械以及滚珠轴承等产品，各省、市、自治区都能制造了。两条腿走路的方针，就像原子核分裂一样，产生了巨大的力量，使机械工业出现了前所未有的蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
    全民办工业的结果，中小型企业的大量兴建，进一步改善了我国机械工业的分布状况。机械工业过去的基础极为薄弱，而又偏集于沿海少数城市，内地广大地区却很少，许多地区几乎没有机械工业。经过第一个五年计划的建设，这种不合理的分布状况有了很大的改变。在1958年的大跃进中，机械工业在沿海城市仍有较大的发展，但是内地机械工业的发展速度也有更大的提高。例如：机械工业的企业分布在内地的比重，已由1955年的25％提高到1958年的51％；内地机械工业职工人数占全国机械工业职工总数的比重，由1955年的33％提高到1958年的48％；内地金属切削机床产量占全国机床总产量的比重，由1955年的11％提高到1958年的32％。原来几乎没有机械工业的地区，特别是少数民族地区，现在都有了机械工业，并且有着突飞猛进的发展。如内蒙古自治区，机械工业的产值1958年比1957年增长了三倍多；原来不能生产冶金设备、矿山设备、起重运输设备、金属切削机床以及锻压设备等产品，现在都能生产了。广西僮族自治区，机械工业的产值1958年比1957年增长了两倍；金属切削机床的产量增长了二十一倍。甘肃省，在大跃进中建立了一百四十多个县以上的机械工厂，并生产了冶金设备、采矿设备、石油设备、机床和动力机械等产品。以上情况充分说明了机械工业的地区分布，已经发生了很大的变化。机械工业合理的地区分布，有助于促进地区经济的发展。
    机械工业的普遍发展，为了逐步实现农业机械化创造了有利的条件。据今年2月间不完全统计，人民公社建立了八万多个小型农具制造修配厂，制造了大量的中小型农具和人畜力牵引的加工机械。去年在全国推广的大量的小型农具，如深耕犁、水利施工工具、运输工具、收割脱粒工具以及滚珠轴承等，有很多是新建立起来的农具制造和修配厂生产的。这些农具的制造和推广，对提高农业劳动生产率，起了重要的作用。
    农业机械开始大量推广，使几千年来使用落后农具的农民摸到了机器，这件事情的伟大意义，必须给予充分的估价。通过农具和简单机器的制造，破除了对工业技术和农业机械化的神秘观点，培养了许许多多的能工巧匠，从而促进了农村文化革命和技术革命的开展。
    两条腿走路的方针所以能够很快地被群众掌握，并且得到立竿见影之效，是因为我国是一个地大、物博、人多又是“一穷二白”的国家，进行社会主义建设迫切需要许多机器设备；两条腿走路的方针正确地反映了人民的迫切愿望和要求。正如毛泽东同志说过的：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”毛泽东同志的这一指示，对机械工业提出了光荣的、伟大的任务，指出了明确的方向。办任何工厂，大炼钢铁，多挖煤炭，多发电，多产粮食、棉花，多发展交通运输事业，多生产人民生活用品，等等，都需要机器；特别是人民公社化以后，各项建设事业得到了迅速的发展，需要的机器就更多。这样，就必须全民动手，在建设大型机械企业的同时，建设更多的中小型机械企业，以迅速增加生产能力，尽快地满足多方面的需要。
    从机械工业本身的特点来看，也必须贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针。机械工业的产品品种和产品结构都很复杂，产品有主体、辅机、配件之分，往往有着成千成万个零件；企业也有制造、修理之分。同时，许多产品的零件和部件往往不在一个企业内生产，要由各种规模的企业协作配合才能成套生产的；随着专业化和协作水平的提高，这种相互关系还将越来越密切。这些特点，决定了机械工业企业的规模需要有大、有中、有小，不能一条腿走路。
    大跃进的实践进一步证明，坚决贯彻执行中央工业与地方工业同时并举、大型企业与中小型企业同时并举的方针，大大加快了机械工业的发展。机械工业的大型骨干企业，得到了中小型企业的配合，真是如虎添翼，可以腾出手来，更快地发展重大产品和尖端技术。大跃进以来，机械工业产品产量的高速度上升，新产品的猛增，成套能力的加强和技术力量的增长等等，没有大型企业是不能实现的，同样没有中小型企业的配合也是不可能实现的。大跃进的实践同样证明，机械工业的大中小企业的发展，同国民经济各部门的大中小企业的发展相结合，同人民公社化运动的发展相结合，就会更快地加速我国社会主义经济建设事业的发展。全民办工业，处处有工厂，便正如党中央所指出的，必然加速国家工业化的进程；加速农业机械化的进程；加速缩小城乡差别的进程。
    当前，我们的重要任务是，在大跃进的基础上，根据全国一盘棋的精神，全面规划，加强领导，按照整个国民经济建设的需要和各个地区的具体条件，进行整顿、巩固和提高的工作，注意机械工业的布局，组织机械工业各个行业的专业化和协作，合理调整制造同修理的比例，使之在新的基础上日臻完善，继续跃进，更充分地发挥全民办机械工业的巨大威力。
    大闹技术革新和技术革命也必须坚持两条腿走路的方针
    对国民经济各个部门进行技术改造，逐步地把它们转到新的技术基础上，转到现代化大生产的技术基础上，这是党的八大二次会议所提出的技术革命的主要任务。这个任务要求机械工业迅速地提高自己的技术水平，加速对各个部门提供又多又好的技术装备。
    大跃进以来，机械工业的技术发展，以空前未有的速度，从仿造一般产品的水平跃进到自行设计和制造重大、精密产品的新阶段。1958年列入当年试制计划的就有一千多种；群众运动一起来，处处搞试制、攻尖端，大大地超过了原来的计划。在试制成功的新产品里，各类有代表性的重要品种达一百二十多种，多半是属于重型、大型、精密和尖端性质的产品。有很多本来计划在两三年、甚至四五年以后，才进行试制的产品，也都提前制造出来了。这些新产品大都是我国自行设计的，或者参照国外技术资料设计出来的。机械工业技术上的这种高速度的飞跃发展，固然是在已有的基础上，充分地吸取了国内外的经验而获得的。但是，更主要的还是由于党的总路线鼓舞了全体职工的干劲，实行了政治挂帅，破除了迷信，发扬了高度的创造精神，开展了广泛的技术革新和技术革命运动，解放了思想，贯彻执行了洋土并举两条腿走路的方针而获得的。
    大跃进前，机械工业的物质技术基础和技术水平，同大跃进中国民经济各个部门向它提出的要求，是不相称的，很多重大和精密的机器设备还生产不了，能够生产的品种在数量上也满足不了。当时摆在我们面前的任务是，如何充分地利用现有条件，把生产能力和技术水平迅速地提高一步，扩大产量，增加品种。如果像某些人所想的，等待另建新厂，从国外进口设备，再来试制；或者等国家把现有的企业都用现代化的设备装备齐全了，再来增加产品的品种和产量，显然地，那就会坐失时机了。
    在这种形势下，职工们尖锐地提出了这样一个问题：如果说我们没有制造重大和精密产品的条件，就不能生产这些产品，那么世界上第一台重型设备哪里来的？第一台精密的机器又怎么制造的？他们一语点明了从无到有、从小到大、从粗到精的这一普通真理，打破了唯条件论者的迷信；用自己的实际行动，千方百计，克服各种困难，展开了攻取重大和精密产品的战斗，并且获得了极大的成就。在这里只举出两个企业的例子。东北机器制造厂接受了制造两千四百马力的大型氮肥设备的任务；这个设备全重一百八十二吨，大的零件重达十多吨；以这个厂的原有加工设备来说，生产这种设备的条件是不足的；但是，广大职工群众在党的领导下，以敢想、敢说、敢做的精神，制造出七种十九台自己设计的中小型专用机床，像蚂蚁啃骨头一样地进行大件加工，创造了条件，克服了困难，终于制成了大型氮肥设备并投入了成批生产。哈尔滨机联机械厂，是一个仅有四十七台陈旧机床的工厂，这个厂的职工创造了能随意拼装的积木式机床，应用蚂蚁啃骨头的方法，制成了直径四米的球磨机、高达四米二的洗涤机、容积二百五十五立方米的高炉、重达五十吨的水泥烘干设备和大型制糖设备。在大跃进中，很多企业的职工，就是以这种大无畏的精神，充分利用现有条件，创造了许多土办法，克服了重重困难，制成了很多从未做过的重大和精密的机器；而且创造了“化大为小、拼小为大、以铸代锻、以铁代钢”、自制专用设备或简易设备等等行之有效的技术经验。这些经验的正确应用和不断提高，不仅在当前，就是在今后，对我们加速掌握重大和精密新产品的制造技术都有重大的意义。
    全民办工业，城乡建立的数以万计的各类工厂，需要大量的机器设备，但是去年国内生产的金属切削机床（不包括简易机床）虽然猛增至五万台，除了用以装备大中型企业以外，能分配到小型企业的数量就很有限了。为了装备这些企业，全国各地在洋土并举的方针的指导下，掀起了大造土机床和简易设备的群众运动，制造了成千上万的结构简单的机械，装备了大量的新建的中小企业。利用这些设备，同洋设备结合起来，不但生产了当地工业、农业、交通运输业和人民生活所需要的某些机器产品，而且许多工厂还依靠这些土的、简易的设备，生产出比它本身更高级的机器。这样，沿着从无到有、由低到高的发展的途径，不断地提高着自己的装备水平和技术水平。
    机械工业就是这样地贯彻执行了洋土并举的方针。既有洋办法，又有土办法；既有洋设备，又有土设备；两者结合起来，整个机械工业的局面就活了。由于我们采取了洋土结合的办法，很多过去被认为没有条件制造的重大和精密的产品，现在能制造了；过去只有少数大型企业能制造的产品，中小型企业也能制造了；新建企业和缺少部分关键设备的企业，也利用土设备迅速地武装起来了；这一来，提高的问题解决了，普及的问题也解决了。这种办法不只是适合我国目前的情况，加速了我们掌握重大和精密产品的进程；而且还由于这里面包含了我国机械职工长期积累下来的宝贵经验，推陈出新，创造出洋土结合得更好的技术经验，丰富了我国机械工业的技术宝库。
    学习和创造的关系问题，也是机械工业技术发展，特别是产品设计工作中的一个重要问题。把学习同创造结合起来，把仿造同自行设计结合起来，这是迅速提高机械工业技术水平的又一个两条腿走路的方针。
    在科学技术上，我们需要经常地强调学习国外的特别是苏联的先进技术。我们所以很快地完成从修配到制造的过渡，是由于我们经过仿造，吸取了苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验，用较短的时间掌握了技术。这就是一种很好的学习办法。我们今天不但有了一个强大的社会主义阵营，而且有在技术上远远超过资本主义国家的苏联的无私援助，就完全可以而且应该充分地利用这个有利条件，直接运用他们的先进成就，加快我们的技术发展。但是，有些人把学习变成了依赖，不开动自己的脑筋，不相信自己的创造能力，不敢动手自行设计，这当然是不对的。
    能不能自行设计，关键在于能不能把学到的国外先进技术，同我国的实际情况结合起来，同职工的制造经验和使用经验结合起来。学得好，又结合得好，就能自己动手设计，创造性地处理设计中所碰到的问题。例如去年制成的容积一千五百一十三立方米的大高炉，以及自行设计并制造的两千五百吨的自由锻造水压机，都是贯彻执行了上述原则的结果。1958年很多企业对于老产品的结构进行了合理的简化和改进，则是更多地反映了职工群众的生产和使用的经验。
    某些人把学习同创造完全对立起来，把1958年群众性的创造发明运动，说成是没有学会走路就要想跑。这种观点是错误的。我们强调学习，就是为了创造；今后的仿造，也要力求结合我国的实际情况和经验，不能完全照搬。只有那些敢于创造的人，才能认真地学习；那些不敢越过仿造圈子的人往往是满足现状，思想没有解放的人，也就更谈不到什么创造了。有人抓住大跃进中某些还不成熟或有缺点的设计，来否认自行设计的道路。这也是完全错误的。应该了解，我们从不能自行设计变成能够自行设计，就是一件了不起的大事。至于某些还不够成熟的设计，经过不断的改进和试验，是必然可以逐渐成熟起来的。
    对待技术上的各种规范、定额和其他技术文件采取什么态度，也是机械工业技术发展中遇到的一个重要问题。这个问题应该从两个方面来对待。一方面，技术规范等等都是近代技术发展的结晶，反映了千百万人长期劳动的经验，是生产中必要的技术规矩；每个职工都应当认真地学习它，并在生产中严格地遵守贯彻它。现代企业的有组织的生产是不能没有章则的，否则就会出现混乱现象。另一方面，任何一种技术规范都不是绝对不变的；它必须随着劳动经验的增长和技术水平的提高，进行修改和补充，用新的来代替旧的，用更好的来代替较好的。这样，才能使生产技术得到日新月异的发展，劳动生产率获得不断的提高。
    技术革新和技术革命的群众运动促使技术不断革命，技术上的一些规范也必须不断地修改和补充。大跃进中，群众以千千万万的革新建议，改革了操作方法，改革了工具，改装了设备，甚至发展到改革工段、车间的工艺路线和整个工厂设计，大大地提高了劳动生产率，提高了“单位面积”的产量。很多企业的职工还对老产品的结构进行了合理的改进，提高了产品的性能，节约了工时和材料。这一切都是机械工业技术水平提高的基础。应该看到，技术并不是神秘的东西，对待它要有革命的态度，敢于不断地以自己劳动所得的更新的经验和成就去代替它，发展它。而不是像那些保守分子和教条主义者那样，把它看成一成不变的死东西。我们要坚持政治挂帅和“充分发动群众，一切经过试验”的原则，开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，积极地组织试验；并且不断地把已经验证合格的革新建议纳入各种技术文件里去。
    十年来，特别是在大跃进中，使我们在已有的经验的基础上，找到了发展技术更快、更好的途径，这就是在党的总路线的指导下，充分依靠群众，破除迷信，解放思想，坚决执行洋土并举的方针，广泛地开展技术革新和技术革命运动，把学习同创造、理论同实践、普及同提高结合起来，充分发挥现有的物质技术基础的潜力，促进机械工业技术水平的不断跃进。
    大搞群众运动，在企业中才能出现轰轰烈烈的局面和扎扎实实的措施
    如上所述，十年来，机械工业的巨大成就以及企业管理的不断改善，都是同在企业中不间断地大搞群众运动分不开的。1958年大跃进的群众运动尤其不同于历年的群众运动。这是在党的建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞和引导下，在农村中人民公社化运动和全民大办钢铁的运动的带动下开展起来的。其发动群众的深透和经验的丰富，都是空前的。我们的企业是社会主义性质的企业，就必须坚定不移地依靠广大的职工群众，大搞群众运动，把集中领导同放手发动群众结合起来，用革命的、轰轰烈烈的群众运动去代替单纯依靠少数人办工业的冷冷清清的局面。这一真理，已经被大跃进的伟大实践所不容置辩地证明了。
    局面的轰轰烈烈同措施的扎扎实实是互相联系、不可分割的。千千万万的生产和技术关键都是轰轰烈烈的群众运动突破的，千千万万的措施都是在轰轰烈烈的运动中群众提出来并且付诸实现的，千万张大字报上载满了扎扎实实的措施，所有的大跃进指标如果不是到轰轰烈烈的群众运动中去落实都是很难实现的。正因为要扎扎实实，才必须轰轰烈烈；只有有了生动活泼的革命局面，才可以激发出广大群众的无穷智慧。借口扎扎实实而不开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动是错误的；满足于表面的轰轰烈烈，而不求措施的扎扎实实，也是不对的。
      有这样一种看法：现代化的机械企业，技术复杂，分工细密，不同于农村；农村中发动群众的那一套不适合于现代化的机械企业。我们认为，正因为技术复杂，分工细密，就不是少数人所能包办的，就更加需要发动群众；直接生产的职工群众最了解生产中和技术上的关键问题所在，只有他们才最能想办法解决这些问题；我们更没有任何理由不依靠作为主人翁的职工来办好我们的企业。那些认为在现代化机械企业中不能大搞群众运动的人，应当很好地重温毛泽东同志1958年9月巡视大江南北以后对新华社记者所说的这些话：“……有一些地方，有一些企业，对于发动群众的工作还没有做好，没有开群众大会，没有将任务、理由和方法，向群众讲得清清楚楚，并在群众中展开辩论。到现在，我们还有一些同志不愿意在工业方面搞大规模的群众运动，他们把在工业战线上搞群众运动，说成是‘不正规’，贬之为‘农村作风’、‘游击习气’。这显然是不对的。”
    1958年的经验证明，在现代化的机械企业中，不但可以和应当大搞群众运动，而且取得了辉煌的成果和创造了丰富的经验。表现在生产技术方面的成果，如产量和质量的提高，品种的空前扩大，技术上的飞跃，劳动生产率的上升和原料材料的大量节约，等等，都是极为显著的。在群众运动的经验方面，例如向群众交形势、交任务、交政策、交方法；发动群众大鸣、大放、大辩论、出大字报；采取比先进、学先进、赶先进等方式广泛地开展社会主义劳动竞赛；组织参观评比，召开现场会议；以及举行几级干部会议，等等。这些方法都是行之有效的，今后还应当广泛采用并且使它日益发展和提高。应当看到，劳动竞赛不止是工作方法问题，而且是执行总路线中鼓足干劲、力争上游的具体表现。开展劳动竞赛时必须贯彻总路线思想，在社会主义建设中立雄心大志，力争高速度。得到普遍推广的两参一改三结合，尤其具有重大的意义。实行了这种办法以后，在企业中人同人的关系便发生了深刻的变化，更为坚实地加强了党委领导下的厂长负责制和党委领导下的职工代表大会制的群众基础，找到了更为具体的贯彻方法，落实在工人群众的日常生产活动中。在这个基础上经过不断地充实和改进，社会主义企业的管理制度就可以逐步地趋于完善。对这一创举的意义，尤其对工人参加管理的意义，是不能低估的。有人以为，只需要专职管理加上走群众路线就够了，不必要工人参加管理。这便是对工人参加管理的重大意义估计不足。如果抱着这样的态度，在进行专职管理时也就不可能很好地走群众路线。
    总之，我们对于在现代化机械企业中开展像1958年那样大规模的群众运动应当抱着满腔热情的肯定的态度。
    成千上万的群众掀起的运动不是绣花，表现在各个方面的成果不可能是整整齐齐地排在一条线上，更不应当要求它不产生一点缺点。问题在于对缺点采取什么态度。譬如在质量方面，某些产品虽然一度出现过质量不好的现象，但不能用这来非难群众运动和否定大跃进的成绩。自然，机械产品的质量是个极关重要的问题。因为机械产品是国民经济各部门的生产工具和技术装备，它的质量的好坏，对各部门的生产和建设都有直接的影响，所以我们必须十分重视质量和不断提高质量。但是质量问题必须根据多快好省的精神全面对待，既要保证质量，又要完成和超额完成国家计划，不可偏废。现在的问题，不是要不要重视产品质量，而是依靠谁和走什么道路来不断提高产品质量和确保产品质量。1958年生产的各种机械产品，早已投入各个生产战线上发挥出巨大的作用，这就是大跃进中大搞群众运动产量与质量齐飞的证明。正因为大跃进和大搞群众运动，所以1958年的产品质量问题比以往任何一年都解决得迅速和良好，许多长期没有解决的质量问题都在大搞群众运动中获得了解决。任何把大搞群众运动同提高产品质量对立起来的看法，都是不对的。事实证明，只有实行政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，才是全面实现多快好省的根本保证。
    1958年波澜壮阔的群众运动及其巨大的成就和宝贵的经验，是广大群众在党的建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下社会主义觉悟大高涨的产物，为今后的继续跃进开辟了一条康庄大道。
    我国机械工业十年来，特别是大跃进以来取得的史无前例的巨大成就，充分证明了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的。对于我们建设事业的伟大成就怀有敌意的右倾机会主义分子，反对党的总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，把高涨的群众运动说成是“小资产阶级狂热性”，把大跃进的伟大成就说成是“得不偿失”、“有失无得”。这些攻击在事实面前都是站不住脚的。
    党的八届八中全会的精神已经深入人心，机械工业出现了新的跃进局面，一个声势浩大的增产节约运动的新高潮正以磅礴之势向前推进。我们机械工业战线上的全体职工同全国人民一起，在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，高举总路线的光辉旗帜，反对右倾，鼓足干劲，沿着大跃进的胜利道路奋勇前进，为制造更多更好的机械来满足全国工业化和农业机械化而奋斗！为实现提前三年完成第二个五年计划的伟大任务而奋斗！为在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的伟大任务而奋斗！（附图片）
