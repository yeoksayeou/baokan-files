On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of your revolutionary victory, please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, and the Hungarian Revolutionary Government of Workers and Peasants, and in the name of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation, to extend our heartfelt congratulations to you—the representatives of the victorious Chinese people.

Today, the whole world is watching Beijing: the people of the fraternal socialist countries are watching with joy and pride, the people who are still suffering oppression are watching with hope and confidence, while the imperialists are watching with hatred and despair. Since the Great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 and the victory over fascism in World War II, the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has been the greatest military feat in world history. This revolution not only won freedom for the broad masses of the Chinese people but also set an example for the oppressed people of all countries, and continues to inspire the struggle for independence of all enslaved and oppressed people. The fact that China, a giant that seemed to have been sleeping for centuries, has shattered its shackles and embarked on a path of rapid progress and prosperity, a path towards socialism and communism, has fundamentally shaken the imperialist colonial system.

Our people admire the heroic struggle of the Chinese people, under the leadership of their revolutionary party, against the imperialist aggressors for their independence. The 25,000-li Long March is an example to the whole world of determination, perseverance, and firm belief in final victory. The stubborn attempts of the American overlords to shield the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on the island of Taiwan, ignoring the People's Republic of China with its 650 million people, are all in vain and only prove that they are blind to history.

The Hungarian people are satisfied and proud to have friends like the strong and outstanding Chinese people; our two peoples are fighting shoulder to shoulder in the socialist camp headed by our common example—the glorious Soviet Union—for peace and a better future for all mankind. Our two peoples are far apart and speak different languages, but this cannot separate us, nor can it prevent the growing friendship and fraternal alliance between us from bearing increasingly abundant fruits. There is an incomparably powerful force that binds us together, one that can overcome distance and language differences, and that is the great ideology and practice of proletarian internationalism. The Hungarian people are deeply concerned about the great and creative construction work that the Chinese people are carrying out under the leadership of their Party and Government to build socialism in their own country. The achievements of China's socialist construction also inspire the working people of our country.

News of valuable initiatives to accelerate this massive construction work has reached our country. The rapid development of the People's Republic of China has also played a major role in the fact that the balance of international forces has shifted significantly in favor of the camp of peace. Finally, on the great festival of the tenth anniversary of your revolutionary victory, please allow me to extend my warmest congratulations to you on behalf of all the Hungarian people. I sincerely wish our great fraternal people happiness and success in their continued efforts to build socialism in their motherland. May the fraternal friendship between the people of the Hungarian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China be further deepened and strengthened in the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the organizer and leader of the revolution, the inspirer of socialist construction!
Long live the peaceful and creative labor of the working people of the People's Republic of China!
Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples! (Attached photo)

    匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席、匈牙利人民共和国党政代表团团长
    道比·伊斯特万同志的贺词
    在你们革命胜利十周年的时候，请允许我根据匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会、匈牙利人民共和国主席团和匈牙利工农革命政府的委托，以匈牙利党政代表团的名义，在这里向你们——胜利的中国人民的代表们——表示衷心的祝贺。
    今天全世界都注视着北京：兄弟的社会主义国家人民是怀着欢乐和自豪的心情，现在还在受压迫的人民是充满着希望和信心，而帝国主义者却是带着仇恨和绝望的心情。自从1917年伟大十月社会主义革命和第二次世界大战中战胜法西斯主义以来，中国人民革命的胜利是世界历史上最伟大的军事上的丰功伟绩。这个革命不仅使中国的广大人民群众赢得了自由，而且给被压迫的各国人民作出了榜样，今天还在鼓舞着一切被奴役、被压迫的人民的独立斗争。中国这个似乎沉睡了多少世纪的巨人，粉碎了他身上的枷锁，走上了以暴风骤雨般的速度突飞猛进、繁荣昌盛的道路，走上了通向社会主义和共产主义的道路，这一事实从根本上动摇了帝国主义的殖民体系。
    我国人民钦佩中国人民在自己的革命政党的领导下为争取独立而对帝国主义侵略者所进行的英勇斗争。二万五千里长征在全世界上是决心、毅力和对最后胜利的坚定信念的范例。美国老爷们顽固地企图在台湾岛上庇护蒋介石卖国集团，无视拥有六亿五千万人口的中华人民共和国，这都是枉费心机，只不过证明了他们是历史的盲人。
    匈牙利人民感到满意和自豪的是：我们有像强大的、卓越的中国人民这样的朋友；我们两国人民在以我们大家的榜样——光荣的苏联——为首的社会主义阵营中为和平和全人类的更美好的未来并肩合作地进行着斗争。我们两国人民遥遥相隔，语言不同，但是这都不能把我们分开，也不能阻碍我们之间发展着的友谊和兄弟同盟结出越来越丰硕的果实。有一种无比强大的力量把我们联结在一起，它能克服遥远的距离和语言的差别，那就是无产阶级国际主义的伟大思想和实践。匈牙利人民深切地关怀着中国人民在他们的党和政府的领导下为在自己的祖国建设社会主义而进行的伟大的、创造性的建设工作。中国社会主义建设的成就也鼓舞着我国的劳动人民。
    加快这个巨大建设工作的宝贵倡议的消息传到了我国。国际力量对比起了有利于和平阵营的重大变化，在这一事实中，中华人民共和国的这种迅速发展也起了重大作用。最后，在你们革命胜利十周年的伟大节日的时候，请允许我代表全体匈牙利人民，向你们表示最热烈的祝贺。衷心地祝我们伟大的兄弟人民幸福地、顺利地为祖国的社会主义建设而继续努力。祝匈牙利人民共和国和中华人民共和国两国人民的兄弟友谊本着无产阶级国际主义的精神进一步加深和增强。
    革命的组织者和领导者、社会主义建设工作的鼓舞者——中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国劳动人民的和平的、创造性的劳动万岁！
    中匈两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！（附图片）
