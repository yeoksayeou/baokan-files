Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Marshal Lin Biao, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense, received all members of the Korean military delegation led by General Kim Kwang-Hyup tonight.
	Marshal Lin Biao had a cordial conversation with the distinguished guests.
	Present at the reception were Marshal He Long, General Luo Ruiqing, General Tan Zheng, General Wang Shusheng, Senior General Li Juikui, Air Force General Liu Zhen, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, and Navy Lieutenant General Luo Shunchu.
	Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Marshal Lin Biao, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the Korean military delegation led by General Kim Kwang-Hyup and Senior General Choi Yong-jin.
	After the banquet began, Marshal Lin Biao spoke first, expressing, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a warm welcome to all comrades of the Korean military delegation led by Comrade Kim Kwang-Hyup and Comrade Choi Yong-jin. He said that today, on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, we are particularly happy to be able to gather together. In the past year, it has been a time of rapid progress in the socialist construction of our two countries. Under the glorious banner of the General Line, China's socialist construction has not only seen an overall Great Leap Forward last year, but also continues to leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward this year. We are also extremely excited to see that the heroic Korean people and the People's Army, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, are leaping forward along the bright road of socialism with the bold steps of riding a Chollima.
	Marshal Lin Biao said that the efforts made by the Korean government and people to peacefully unify their country and to maintain peace in the Far East and the world have won universal praise and support from the people of all countries. In contrast, the US imperialists, completely disregarding the wishes of the Korean people and all peace-loving people around the world, not only refuse to withdraw their aggressor troops from South Korea, but also continue to undermine the armistice agreement, increase armed forces in South Korea, transport atomic weapons and rocket weapons, and constantly carry out provocative activities, deliberately escalating the tense situation. Marshal Lin Biao then pointed out that the Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. With the support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world, the Korean people's struggle will surely achieve final victory.
	General Kim Kwang-Hyup said in his speech that we are extremely delighted to be able to come to the great neighbor—the People's Republic of China—and celebrate the glorious National Day of the Chinese people with our closest comrades-in-arms. After outlining the great achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects over the past ten years, he said that the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement of the Chinese people are creating great miracles with each passing day. The powerful armed forces led by the Communist Party of China—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—not only defends the socialist construction of its own country, but also makes great contributions to the great cause of maintaining peace in Asia and the world.
	General Kim Kwang-Hyup said that the people of North Korea and China have forged an unbreakable friendship and unity in the long struggle against common enemies. This friendship and unity has been further consolidated and developed in the just struggle against armed aggression led by US imperialism.
	General Kim Kwang-Hyup concluded by saying that the US imperialist aggressors are still clinging to South Korea, constantly undermining the armistice agreement, clamoring for war, and hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea. Recently, the US imperialists have been intensifying their efforts to create tension in Southeast Asia. If the enemy dares to provoke a new war, it will perish by its own hand.
	Marshal He Long, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, General Luo Ruiqing, General Tan Zheng, General Wang Shusheng, General Su Yu, Senior General Zhang Zongxun, Senior General Gan Siqi, Senior General Chen Xilian, Senior General Yang Yong, Senior General Li Zhimin, Senior General Fu Qiutao, Air Force General Liu Zhen, Senior General Yang Zhicheng, Senior General Song Shilun, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, and Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army attended the banquet.
	Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei and Vice President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association Lao She attended the banquet.
	Also invited to the banquet were Korean Ambassador to China Ri Yong-ho and military attachés of various countries in China.
	Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Marshal Lin Biao, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense, received all members of the Vietnamese military delegation headed by General Vo Nguyen Giap this morning.
	The guests and hosts had a cordial conversation.
	Present at the reception were General Luo Ruiqing, General Tan Zheng, General Xu Guangda, Senior General Li Juikui, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Navy Lieutenant General Zhou Xihan, and Air Force Lieutenant General Wang Bingzhang.
	Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Marshal Lin Biao, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense, hosted a banquet today to welcome the Vietnamese military delegation. Marshal Lin Biao said at the banquet that the Chinese people firmly advocate that the United States must be stopped from threatening the security of China and Vietnam and endangering peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia; the independence and peaceful neutrality of Laos must be guaranteed in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.
	After the banquet began, Marshal Lin Biao spoke first, expressing, on behalf of the Chinese people and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a warm welcome to Comrade Vo Nguyen Giap and all members of the delegation. He said that there is a long history of friendly relations between the people of China and Vietnam. In recent years, the relations of mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries in the cause of building socialism and defending peace have been fully developed, further increasing and consolidating our friendship.
	When Marshal Lin Biao spoke about the great victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in socialist transformation and socialist construction, he said that the Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the brilliant achievements of the fraternal Vietnamese people. Then, he said, the Vietnamese People's Army is a people's army with a long history of training and glorious revolutionary traditions. Now, it has become a strong force to defend the socialist construction of the Vietnamese people and strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Marshal Lin Biao said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, strictly abided by the Geneva Accords, and made unremitting efforts to maintain peace in Indochina and realize the reunification of the motherland. However, the US imperialists and their lackey, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, adhere to a policy of war, not only consistently undermining the Geneva Accords and obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, but also constantly creating tense situations in the Indochina region. Marshal Lin Biao stressed that China and Vietnam are both peace-loving countries. We never invade others, but we will never allow others to invade us. The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to safeguard the Geneva Accords and strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and firmly believe that this struggle will win the final and complete victory.
	General Vo Nguyen Giap spoke at the banquet. On behalf of the Vietnamese people and all commanders and fighters of the People's Army, he extended cordial and fraternal greetings to the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, the people, and all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He expressed warm congratulations on the great achievements made by the Chinese people and army over the past ten years.
	General Vo Nguyen Giap, in denouncing the US imperialists for intensifying their military intervention in Laos, said that the Vietnamese people strongly condemn the US imperialists and the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc and the pro-US reactionary group in Laos for blatantly undermining the Geneva Accords and disrupting peace in Indochina. The US imperialists must immediately stop any interference in the internal affairs of Laos, and the Phoui Sananikone government must strictly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreement. This is the only way to eliminate the current tense situation in Laos.
	Marshal He Long, General Luo Ruiqing, General Tan Zheng, General Xu Guangda, Senior General Yang Chengwu, Senior General Peng Shaohui, Senior General Fu Zhong, Senior General Li Juikui, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Navy Lieutenant General Zhou Xihan, and Air Force Lieutenant General Wang Bingzhang and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army attended the banquet.
	Also attending the banquet were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei and Ding Xilin, Director of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association.
	Pham Binh, Counselor of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, and military attachés of various countries in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    新华社27日讯　副总理兼国防部长林彪元帅今晚接见了以金光侠大将为首的朝鲜军事代表团全体人员。
    林彪元帅和贵宾们作了亲切的交谈。
    接见时在座的有贺龙元帅、罗瑞卿大将、谭政大将、王树声大将、李聚奎上将、刘震空军上将、萧向荣中将和罗舜初海军中将。
    新华社27日讯　副总理兼国防部长林彪元帅今晚举行宴会，欢迎以金光侠大将和崔勇进上将为首的朝鲜军事代表团。
    宴会开始后，林彪元帅首先讲话，他代表中国人民和中国人民解放军，向以金光侠同志和崔勇进同志为首的朝鲜军事代表团的全体同志们表示热烈的欢迎。他说，今天，在我国建国十周年的前夕，我们能够欢聚在一堂，使我们格外高兴。近一年以来，正是我们两国人民社会主义建设事业突飞猛进的时刻。我国的社会主义建设事业，在总路线的光辉旗帜下，不但在去年出现了全面大跃进的局面，而且今年也在大跃进的基础上继续跃进。我们也极其兴奋地看到，英雄的朝鲜人民和人民军，在朝鲜劳动党和政府的正确领导下，以跨上千里马的豪迈步伐，沿着社会主义的光明大道飞跃前进。
    林彪元帅说，朝鲜政府和人民，为和平统一自己的祖国，为维护远东和世界和平所作的努力赢得了各国人民的普遍赞扬和支持。与此相反，美帝国主义则根本不顾朝鲜人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民的愿望，不但不撤走在南朝鲜的侵略军，还不断破坏停战协定，在南朝鲜增加武装力量，运进原子武器及火箭武器，并不断进行挑衅活动，蓄意加剧紧张局势。林彪元帅接着指出，中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国的正义斗争，在以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营和全世界一切爱好和平人民的支持下，朝鲜人民的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。
    金光侠大将致词说，我们能够来到伟大的邻邦——中华人民共和国同最亲密的战友们在一起迎接中国人民的光荣的国庆节感到极大的喜悦。他在概述了十年来中国人民在各方面所取得的伟大成就后说，中国人民的大跃进和人民公社运动正在日新月异地创造着伟大的奇迹。中国共产党领导的强有力的武装力量——中国人民解放军不但捍卫着自己祖国的社会主义建设，并对维护亚洲和世界和平的伟大事业作出了极大的贡献。
    金光侠大将说，朝中两国人民在反对共同敌人的长期的斗争中结成了牢不可破的友谊和团结。这种友谊和团结在反对以美帝国主义为首的武装侵略的正义斗争中得到了进一步的巩固和发展。
    金光侠大将最后说，美帝国主义侵略者至今仍旧赖在南朝鲜，不断地破坏停战协定、叫嚣战争和阻挠朝鲜人民的和平统一。最近美帝国主义者又正在东南亚加紧制造紧张局势。如果敌人胆敢挑起新的战争，那么它将自取灭亡。
    贺龙元帅、聂荣臻元帅、罗瑞卿大将、谭政大将、王树声大将、粟裕大将、张宗逊上将、甘泗淇上将、陈锡联上将、杨勇上将、李志民上将、傅秋涛上将、刘震空军上将、杨志诚上将、宋时轮上将、刘志坚中将、萧向荣中将等中国人民解放军高级将领出席宴会作陪。
    外交部副部长姬鹏飞、中朝友协副会长老舍出席了宴会。
    应邀出席宴会的还有朝鲜驻华大使李永镐和各国驻华武官。
    新华社27日讯　副总理兼国防部长林彪元帅今天上午接见了以武元甲大将为首的越南军事代表团全体人员。

    接见时在座的有罗瑞卿大将、谭政大将、许光达大将、李聚奎大将、萧向荣中将、周希汉海军中将和王秉璋空军中将。
    新华社27日讯　副总理兼国防部长林彪元帅今天举行宴会，欢迎越南军事代表团。林彪元帅在宴会上说，中国人民坚决主张，必须制止美国威胁中、越两国安全、危害印度支那和东南亚地区和平的活动；老挝的独立和和平中立地位，必须按照日内瓦协议的规定得到保证。
    宴会开始后，林彪元帅首先讲话，他代表中国人民和中国人民解放军全体官兵，向武元甲同志和代表团全体人员表示热烈的欢迎。他说，中、越两国人民之间有着悠久的友好关系。近年来我们两国在建设社会主义和保卫和平的事业中互助合作关系有了全面的发展，使我们的友谊得到了进一步的增长和巩固。
    林彪元帅谈到英勇的越南人民在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中都取得了巨大的胜利时说，中国人民为兄弟的越南人民所取得的光辉成就，感到欢欣鼓舞。接着，他说，越南人民军是一支久经锻炼的、有着光荣革命传统的人民军队。现在，它已成为保卫越南人民的社会主义建设，争取祖国和平统一的坚强力量。林彪元帅说，越南民主共和国政府向来执行和平外交政策，严格地履行日内瓦协议，为维护印度支那和平、实现祖国统一作了坚持不懈的努力。但是美帝国主义者和它的走狗吴庭艳集团，坚持战争政策，不但一贯破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的和平统一，并且不断地在印度支那地区制造紧张局势。林彪元帅着重指出，中、越两国都是爱好和平的国家。我们从来不侵略别人，但是也决不允许别人侵略我们。中国人民完全支持越南人民维护日内瓦协议，争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争，并深信这个斗争，一定会赢得最后的完全胜利。
    武元甲大将在宴会上讲话。他代表越南人民和人民军全体指战员，向中国共产党、中国政府、人民和中国人民解放军全体同志致以亲切的兄弟般的敬礼。他对十年来中国人民和军队所取得的巨大成就表示热烈的祝贺。
    武元甲大将在痛斥美帝国主义加强对老挝的军事干涉时说，越南人民极力谴责明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议、破坏印度支那和平的美帝国主义及东南亚侵略集团和老挝亲美反动集团。美帝国主义必须立刻停止任何干涉老挝内政的行为，培·萨纳尼空政府必须严格履行日内瓦协议和万象协议。这是消除目前老挝紧张局势的唯一途径。
    贺龙元帅、罗瑞卿大将、谭政大将、许光达大将、杨成武上将、彭绍辉上将、傅钟上将、李聚奎上将、萧向荣中将、周希汉海军中将、王秉璋空军中将等中国人民解放军高级将领出席宴会作陪。
