Adhere to Putting Politics in Command and Vigorously Develop Mass Movements
The Communist Party of China, Pingshan County Committee

    Like the rest of the country, Pingshan County, Hebei Province, is experiencing an infinitely positive situation. On the foundation of the Great Leap Forward last year, we have achieved continued leaps forward this year. In agricultural production, the county achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in the summer, with the total output of wheat increasing by 19% compared to the bumper harvest of 1958. The autumn field crops are also stronger than last year, with a surplus of 10-20% fully assured. In industrial production, the iron smelting task for the first half of the year was completed ahead of schedule by the end of May, consistently maintaining the "Excellent Red Banner". The production of machinery, light industry, the chemical industry, and handicrafts has all seen great development, with the total industrial output value increasing by 161% compared to the same period last year. New leaps forward were also achieved on the financial and cultural-educational fronts in the first half of the year. Since the publication of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the people of the county have been even more spirited. Workers are determined to strive to complete the industrial tasks for the whole year one and a half months ahead of schedule; commune members are determined to over fulfill this year's agricultural production increase plan targets.
    The achievement of these successes is inseparable from the Pingshan County Party organization's adherence to the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune banner, under the leadership of the higher-level Party organization, and its adherence to putting politics in command and vigorously developing mass movements.
  
  Regularly Analyze the Situation and Vigorously Grasp Ideological Work
    Adhering to putting politics in command means first adhering to the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune banner, and actively guiding cadres and the masses to bravely advance along this glorious and victorious road. This requires, under the leadership of the Party organization, timely and correctly analyzing the situation, proposing new battle slogans in a timely manner through the analysis of the economic and political situation, vigorously grasping ideological work, vigorously carrying out propaganda movements, and greatly encouraging enthusiasm. Only in this way can the broad masses of cadres and people constantly maintain a clear mind, high morale, and continuously move forward. When deploying the leap forward tasks for 1959 this spring, the Pingshan County Party Committee found that some cadres had confused understanding of achieving continued leaps forward, saying "the potential was exhausted in 1958." At this time, the county Party committee analyzed the situation and summarized the ten favorable conditions for realizing continued leaps forward, and then organized thousands of troops to carry out publicity activities. People saw the favorable situation and strengthened their confidence in continued leaps forward. Later, in the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes, it was found that some people with right-leaning sentiments exaggerated certain difficulties and shortcomings in the process of advancement, lacked a correct assessment of the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, and some even wanted to lay down their arms and cease their efforts, and did not advocate carrying out mass movements on a large scale again. At this time, after careful and meticulous investigation and analysis, the county Party committee criticized the pessimistic and right-leaning thinking of some people at the five-level cadre meeting held at the time, and loudly proposed: "The red flag must be held higher, and the war drums must be beaten louder!" Calling on party members, cadres and masses throughout the county to advance victoriously. During the campaign for overproduction in rural areas, the vast majority of cadres and the masses were full of confidence and full of energy, but a small number of people still had the idea of "fixed outcome," saying that "the autumn harvest is fixed at the beginning of autumn, and management is useless," and wanted to hang up their hoes and rest. The county Party committee immediately held an on-site meeting, organized team cadres to actually observe in the fields, analyzed the overproduction potential of various crops, and after specific on-site accounting, unanimously realized that it was a great time to seize overproduction, thereby breaking the "fixed outcome" theory and powerfully promoting the development of the overproduction campaign.
    Each time the situation is analyzed, after clarifying and unifying ideological understanding within the Party, a vigorous propaganda movement is immediately carried out among the masses, and through extensive and in-depth propaganda, the Party's call is turned into the actual action of the broad masses. In the overproduction competition campaign, through in-depth publicity and carrying out great debates, the broad masses of grassroots party member cadres and commune members not only refuted the "fixed outcome" theory of some people with facts, but also contributed more than 110,000 ideas for winning overproduction.

    Plant Red Flags, Establish Pace-setters, You Catch Up with Me
    Planting red flags, establishing pace-setters, and mobilizing the backward to catch up with the advanced are extremely valuable experiences from the mass movements carried out on a large scale in 1958. This year, we applied this experience to the new leap forward, and erected four red flags of three types in the county's production teams: the Gaocun Production Team in the plains, the Qiejiazhuang Production Team along the river, the Sancha Production Team in the deep mountain area, and the Nangunlonggou Production Team. In order to hold these four banners high and make them well-known, the county Party committee often sends cadres and technicians there to help with their work and summarize their experiences. Because these are red flags for achieving increased production in different regions, production teams throughout the county with various natural conditions have their own examples to learn from and catch up with. The county Party committee has held many on-site meetings in these places, organized visits, and launched a large-scale production increase competition campaign to learn from Sancha and catch up with Gaocun throughout the county. This greatly encouraged people's confidence in striving for the upper reaches and striving for increased production. This summer, the county Party committee convened the party committee secretaries of various communes and some production team branch secretaries to visit the wheat in Gaocun, Qiejiazhuang, and Sancha. The people who had originally shaken their heads were convinced in the face of the facts. They said: It is up to people to do it, and more production can be increased with hard work. This on-site meeting greatly promoted the later stage management of wheat at that time.
    In this year's continued leap forward movement, all fronts, departments, and aspects of the county have counterpart competitions, opponent competitions, pace-setters, top scorers, and red flag bearers. In the first half of the year, more than 28,000 pace-setters, red flag bearers, and heroic models were selected throughout the county. Through putting them on the honor roll, honor platform, holding celebration meetings, and carrying out learning, chasing, and catching-up competition movements, all fronts presented a vivid and lively situation of you chasing me, everyone striving for the upper reaches, and striving for the red flag, which powerfully promoted the development of various tasks.
    While vigorously grasping the advanced, special attention was also paid to helping the backward catch up with the advanced. Practice has proved that as long as these two ends are grasped well, an all-round leap forward can be driven. We mainly started from three aspects in this work: First, cultivate typical examples of the backward catching up with the advanced; second, help backward units analyze favorable factors and establish the ambition to change their appearance; and third, grasp the leading backbone and, when necessary, send some leading backbones to work in backward areas, or provide necessary material support. Nandian Commune, known as the "Sand and Soil Kingdom," is a low-yield commune in Pingshan County. In order to completely change the working face of this commune, the county Party committee, in addition to helping them find the reasons for low yields and formulate plans for catching up with the advanced, also made a special decision to provide support in terms of manpower and material resources. This greatly stimulated the courage of cadres and commune members of this commune to catch up with the advanced and strive for the upper reaches. As a result, the autumn crops of this commune generally grew well, and won a red flag in a recent evaluation. In order to point out the direction for the backward teams in the county, a red flag for the backward to catch up with the advanced - Changsang Production Team - was also erected. In the summer, some leading cadres of this team reduced production of wheat due to right-leaning thinking. After the leaders helped them summarize the lessons learned from production reduction, they jumped to become a high-yield team in the autumn, especially in rice, ranking first in the county. The county Party committee seized this typical example and organized backward teams to learn from Changsang and catch up with Changsang. Because a clear direction was pointed out for the backward teams and a living model was put up, the result was that many backward teams plucked up the courage and caught up.

      Go to the Masses to Lead the Masses
    In order to do a good job in mass movements, leaders must stand at the forefront of the movement, share the same breath and destiny with the broad masses, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. We learned from the experience of organizing the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958 and conscientiously implemented the "Four Guarantees" leadership method, which is: the county Party committee secretary guarantees the war zone, the committee member guarantees the commune, the commune cadre guarantees the management area, and the management area cadre guarantees the production team. Since this year, the county Party committee has often had two-thirds of the secretaries, one-half of the committee members, leading more than 100 county-level agency cadres to the front line to direct production. After these comrades went deep into the grassroots, they ate, lived, and labored with the masses. The masses regarded them as their own relatives and were willing to tell them their innermost thoughts. They were also the easiest to understand the masses' thoughts and demands, which facilitated in-depth research on the Party's policies, and specifically helped grassroots cadres improve their working methods and implement the Party's mass line. For example, when Liang Ge, the secretary of the county Party committee secretariat, went to Yingli Commune in the deep mountain area to help with his work, he discovered that there were problems in the implementation of the pig raising and manure accumulation reward policy. He immediately coordinated with the commune cadres, discussed with the masses, and studied specific solutions, which greatly promoted the development of the local pig raising industry.
    According to the central government's instructions on cadres at all levels participating in physical labor, the county Party committee stipulated that going deep into reality, participating in production, and contacting the masses should be regarded as an important content for measuring cadres, and regularly checked, summarized, and announced it, so that the broad masses of cadres could consciously go deep into their work and become one with the masses.

  Give Play to the Fortress Role of Grassroots Party Organizations
    In the mass movement, in implementing the Party's various policies and guidelines and realizing the various work tasks proposed by the Party, it is necessary to give full play to the fighting fortress role of grassroots Party organizations and give play to the exemplary leading role of the broad masses of Party members. In order to enable the broad masses of Party members and cadres to keep up with the requirements of the development of the situation and give full play to their backbone role, the county Party committee first prominently grasped the ideological education of Party members and cadres, and regularly conducted education on the Party's general line and socialist construction theory, education on the Party's policies and guidelines and working methods, and education on the great communist future for them. In the past six months, the county Party school and the Party schools of various communes have trained 80% of the rural grassroots Party members in rotation. Usually, the Party branches of each production team generally insist on having two Party classes a month; each management area has a Party class education and dissemination station, where the general branch secretary convenes branch instructors to prepare lessons. At the same time, in view of the fact that there are many old Party members in Pingshan County, education on "carrying forward revolutionary traditions and striving for greater glory" is also frequently carried out for old Party members, encouraging them to create miracles in the face of new struggle tasks and contribute greater strength to the Party. This has worked very well. Party members have reflected that they are clear-headed and have more ways to do their work.
    We have also tightly grasped the competition and evaluation work of branches and Party members, and issued calls and put forward requirements to all Party members according to the different work centers in various periods. Most of the 700 grassroots branches in the county have established Party member evaluation platforms, honor rolls, and honor trees. The Xihuangni Party Branch of Hongzidian Commune adopted the method of "one tree for one Party member and one flower for one plan". Whoever contributes an idea will have a flower bloom on the tree, and whoever implements an idea will bear a fruit, greatly stimulating the political enthusiasm of Party members. The Gaojiazhuang Branch of Huishe Commune, originally had a small number of Party members who were not active in their work and showed fatigue. In the branch competition and evaluation movement, they gradually improved their consciousness, changed their work attitude, and became active members in the overproduction competition movement.

    坚持政治挂帅　大搞群众运动
    中共平山县委员会
    河北平山县和全国各地一样，形势无限好。在去年大跃进的基础上，又实现了今年的继续跃进。全县在农业生产上夏季得到了空前丰收，小麦总产量比大丰收的1958年增产了19％；秋季大田作物又比去年强，超产一二成满有把握。在工业生产上，上半年的炼铁任务已经在5月底提前超额完成，始终保持了优胜红旗；机械、轻工业、化学工业和手工业生产，都有很大发展，工业总产值比去年同期增长了161％。在财经和文教战线上，上半年也实现了新的跃进。党的八届八中全会决议公布以来，全县人民更加意气风发。职工们决心要争取提前一个半月完成全年工业上的任务；公社社员们定要超额完成今年的农业增产计划指标。
    这些成绩的取得，是和平山县党组织在上级党的领导下，坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜，坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动分不开的。
  经常分析形势大抓思想工作
    坚持政治挂帅，首先是坚持总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜，积极引导干部和群众，沿着这条光荣的胜利的道路奋勇前进。这就需要在党组织的领导下，及时地正确地分析形势，通过分析经济、政治形势，适时提出新的战斗口号，大抓思想工作，大搞宣传运动，大鼓干劲。这样，才能使广大干部和群众经常保持头脑清醒，斗志旺盛，不断向前。今年春季部署1959年的跃进任务时，平山县委发现部分干部对实现继续跃进有糊涂认识，说“1958年把潜力挖尽了。”这时，县委分析形势，总结出实现继续跃进的十大有利条件，接着组织千军万马开展宣传活动。人们看到了有利形势，坚定了继续跃进的信心。后来，在整顿巩固人民公社的工作中，发现有些有右倾情绪的人夸大某些前进中的困难和缺点，对大跃进、人民公社的伟大成绩缺乏正确的估计，有的人甚至想偃旗息鼓，不主张再大搞群众运动。这时，县委经过认真细致地调查和分析研究，在当时召开的五级干部大会上批判了某些人畏难悲观的右倾思想，响亮地提出：“红旗要举得更高，战鼓要敲得更响！”号召全县的党员干部和群众乘胜前进。在农村中开展超产竞赛运动的时候，绝大多数的干部和群众信心百倍，干劲十足，但仍有少数人有“定局论”思想，说什么“立秋年景定，管理不顶用”，想挂锄休战。县委立即召开现场会，组织队干部到地里实际观察，分析各种农作物的超产潜力，经过现场具体算账，一致认识到目前正是夺取超产的大好时光，从而打破了“定局论”，有力地推动了超产竞赛运动的开展。
    每次分析形势，在党内明确和统一思想认识以后，就紧跟着向群众开展轰轰烈烈的宣传运动，通过广泛深入的宣传，把党的号召变成广大群众的实际行动。在超产竞赛运动中，经过深入宣传，开展大鸣大放大辩论，广大基层党员干部和社员群众，不但用事实驳倒了某些人的“定局论”，还为争取超产献计献策十一万多条。
    插红旗立标兵你追我赶
    插红旗，立标兵，发动落后追赶先进，是1958年大搞群众运动的一项极为宝贵的经验。今年我们把这条经验应用到新的跃进中来，在全县生产队中树起平原的高村生产队、沿河的郄家庄生产队、深山区的三岔生产队、南滚龙沟生产队等三种类型的四面红旗。为了把这四面旗帜举得高，叫得响，县委常派干部和技术员在那里帮助工作，总结经验。因为这是不同地区实现增产的红旗，全县具有各种不同自然条件的生产队都有自己学习、追赶的榜样。县委曾多次在这些地方开现场会，组织参观，在全县范围内大张旗鼓地开展学三岔、赶高村的增产竞赛运动。这样就大大鼓舞了人们争上游、争增产的信心。今年夏季县委召集各公社党委书记和部分生产队支部书记参观了高村、郄家庄和三岔的小麦，原来摇头的人在事实面前心服口服了，他们说：事在人为，有干劲就能多增产。这个现场会大大推动了当时的小麦后期管理工作。
    在今年的继续跃进运动中，全县各条战线、各个部门和各个方面，都有对口赛、对手赛、有标兵、有状元、有红旗手。上半年，在全县共选出标兵、红旗手、英雄模范二万八千多人，通过给他们上光荣榜、光荣台、开庆功会、开展学、追、赶的竞赛运动，各个战线都呈现着你追我赶、个个争上游、争红旗的生动活泼局面，有力地推动了各项工作的开展。
    在大抓先进的同时，还特别注意了帮助落后赶先进。实践证明，只要这两头抓得好，就能带动全面跃进。我们在这一工作中主要是从三方面入手的：一、培养落后赶先进的典型；二、帮助落后单位分析有利因素，树立改变面貌的雄心大志，三、抓领导骨干，必要时派一些领导骨干到落后地区工作，或给以必要的物质支援。号称“沙土国”的南甸公社是平山县的低产社，为彻底改变这个公社的工作面貌，县委除帮助他们找低产原因，制定赶先进的规划，还专门作了决定，从人力、物力上给予支持。这样就大大激发了这个公社干部和社员赶先进、争上游的勇气，结果这个公社的大秋作物普遍生长良好，在最近一次评比中获得了红旗。为了给全县落后队指出方向，还树起了一面落后赶先进的红旗——长桑生产队。夏季这队有些领导干部由于有右倾思想，小麦减了产，经领导帮助他们总结减产的教训，在秋季一跃变成了高产队，尤其是水稻跃居全县第一。县委就抓住这个典型，组织落后队学长桑、赶长桑。由于给落后队指出了明确的方向，摆出了活的样板，结果使好多落后队鼓起勇气，赶了上来。
      到群众中去领导群众
    为了搞好群众运动，领导者必须站在运动的最前哨，跟广大群众同呼吸共命运，及时发现问题解决问题。我们吸取1958年组织生产大跃进的经验，认真执行了“四包”的领导方法，就是：县委书记包战区，委员包公社，社干部包管理区，管理区干部包生产队。今年以来，县委经常有三分之二的书记，二分之一的委员，带领一百多名县级机关干部到第一线指挥生产。这些同志深入基层以后，与群众同吃同住同劳动，群众都把他们看作自己的亲人，愿意把心腹话讲给他们听，他们也就最容易了解群众的思想和要求，便于深入研究党的政策，和具体帮助基层干部改进工作方法，贯彻党的群众路线。比如，县委书记处书记梁格到深山区营里公社帮助工作时，发现这里执行养猪积肥奖励政策中有问题，马上协同社干部，经过和群众商量，研究了具体解决的办法，对当地养猪事业的发展起了很大推动作用。
    县委根据中央关于各级干部参加体力劳动的指示，规定把深入实际、参加生产、联系群众作为衡量干部的重要内容，定期检查总结公布，使广大干部能自觉地深入工作，同群众打成一片。
  发挥基层党组织的堡垒作用
    在群众运动中，在贯彻执行党的各项方针政策和实现党提出的各项工作任务当中，必须充分发挥基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用，发挥广大党员的模范带头作用。为了使广大党员、干部能跟上形势发展的要求，充分发挥骨干作用，县委首先突出地抓住了对党员、干部的思想教育工作，经常向他们进行党的总路线和社会主义建设理论的教育，进行党的方针政策和工作方法的教育，进行伟大的共产主义前途的教育。半年多来，县委党校和各公社党校已经把全县80％的农村基层党员轮训了一遍，平时各生产队党支部一般每月坚持上两次党课；各管理区都设有党课教育传授站，由总支书记召集支部教员备课。同时，针对平山县老党员较多的情况，还经常对老党员进行“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教育，鼓励他们在新的斗争任务面前创造奇迹，为党贡献出更大的力量。这样做效果很好，党员反映说：心明眼亮，干工作更有办法了。
    我们还紧紧地抓住了支部、党员的评比竞赛工作，根据各个时期不同的工作中心，向全体党员发出号召，提出要求。全县七百个基层支部大部分都建立了党员评比台、光荣榜、光荣树等。洪子店公社西黄埿党支部，采用“一个党员一棵树，一项计谋一朵花”的方法，谁献一计树上就开一朵花，实现一计结一个果，大大激发了党员们的政治积极性。回舍公社郜家庄支部，原来有少数党员工作不积极，表现疲沓，在支部竞赛评比运动中，逐渐提高了觉悟，工作态度转变了，成了超产竞赛运动中的积极分子。
