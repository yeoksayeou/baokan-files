Xinhua News Agency, Miyun, 6th: Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo, inspected the Miyun Reservoir today. Accompanying them were ministers and vice ministers, directors and vice directors of various industrial and transportation ministries and commissions, including Wang Heshou, Zhao Erlu, Li Baohua, Liu Lanbo, Song Renqiong, Liu Xiufeng, Zhang Linzhi, Wang Shoudao, Chen Zhengren, He Changgong, Lü Zhengcao, Han Guang, Sun Zhiyuan, as well as Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Kang Keqing, Vice Chairman, and more than 150 others.

Zhao Fan and Wang Xian, Party Committee Secretary and General Commander of the Miyun Reservoir Construction, Party Committee Secretaries Wang Yuzhong and Fan Puquan, and Yang Sen accompanied them.

Chairman Zhu De, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Bo Yibo, and others inquired about the reservoir project and the lives of the reservoir laborers from Wang Xian. Then, together with the ministers and vice ministers, directors and vice directors of various ministries and commissions, they visited the Baihe Dam. After inspecting the reservoir, they unanimously agreed that the Miyun Reservoir is the largest reservoir in terms of capacity and earthwork, yet built in the shortest time with the quickest flood control effect in North China since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The reason for this achievement is undoubtedly due to the people of twenty-one counties (districts) under Hebei Province and Beijing, inspired by the Party's General Line and the Great Leap Forward, exerting great effort, cooperating with each other, and supporting each other.

    朱委员长等视察密云水库
    新华社密云6日电　朱德委员长，李富春、薄一波副总理，今天视察了密云水库。和他们一同前来视察的还有工业、交通各部委的正副部长，正副主任王鹤寿、赵尔陆、李葆华、刘澜波、宋任穷、刘秀峰、张霖之、王首道、陈正人、何长工、吕正操、韩光、孙志远及全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅、副主席康克清等一百五十多人。
    陪同他们的有密云水库党委书记、水库修建总指挥赵凡、王宪，党委书记王玉中、范普权和杨森。
    朱德委员长、李富春、薄一波副总理等向王宪询问了有关水库工程和水库民工生活的各种情况，然后，和同来的各部委正副部长、正副主任等一起参观了白河大坝。他们视察了水库后，一致认为，密云水库是我国建国以来在华北修建的容积最大、土方最多但是工期最短、起拦洪效果最快的一个水库，其所以收到这个效果的原因，无疑地是由于河北省和北京市所属二十一个县（区）的人民在党的总路线和大跃进鼓舞下，鼓足干劲，相互协作，相互支援的结果。
