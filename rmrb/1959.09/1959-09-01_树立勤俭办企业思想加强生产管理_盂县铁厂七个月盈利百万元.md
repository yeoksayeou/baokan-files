Establish the Idea of Running Enterprises Through Diligence and Thrift, Strengthen Production Management
Yu County Iron Factory Earns One Million Yuan in Seven Months

(Our newspaper Taiyuan, August 31st dispatch) The Yu County Iron Factory in Shanxi Province mobilized the masses to improve production management, adhered to the principle of running enterprises through diligence and thrift. The production cost of small blast furnaces in the entire factory decreased month by month, resulting in a total profit of 1,172,200 yuan from January to July. It has become a red banner of high yield, high quality, and low cost among the (small Western-style furnace group) iron factories in the province.

The Yu County Iron Factory was developed during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. It was originally two small iron factories, and the earliest furnace had only been in operation for a little over a year. In 1958, the average cost of producing one ton of pig iron in the factory was as high as 219 yuan. At the end of the year, there was a total loss of 14,900 yuan. To improve this situation, the factory Party committee seriously analyzed the reasons for the high cost. While taking a series of improvement measures, they also launched a high-yield, high-quality competition centered on reducing costs among the factory's employees. After a period of effort, the average cost of producing one ton of iron in the factory this year has been reduced to 193 yuan, a decrease of 66 yuan compared to the end of last year. Starting in April, although the prices of raw materials such as ore and coking coal and transportation have increased compared to the first quarter, the costs in May, June, and July continued to decline month by month. By July, the cost of producing one ton of iron in the factory decreased from 193 yuan in the first half of the year to 189 yuan.

In the high-yield, high-quality competition, the factory Party committee helped each workshop with specific accounting and focused on production management, while organizing workers to accelerate the improvement of production levels, effectively promoting the monthly reduction of costs. They discovered in specific accounting that if the utilization coefficient of the entire factory increased by 0.1 tons, the cost of each ton of iron could be reduced by 6.32 yuan; if labor efficiency doubled, the cost of each ton of iron could be reduced by 3.59 yuan. In response to the materials discovered in the accounting, the Party committee promptly organized workers to conduct discussions, focusing the cost reduction on high yield, high quality, and high efficiency. Subsequently, a socialist competition movement centered on high yield, high quality, and high efficiency was vigorously launched throughout the factory.

While the output, quality, and efficiency rapidly increased, the Party committee promptly took measures to correct the growing wasteful phenomena in the enterprise that disregarded costs, and mobilized workers to make practicing strict economy and running the enterprise diligently and thriftily an important part of the competition. To this end, they first started by strengthening raw material management, striving to reduce the loss rate. Workers at the mining site adopted the principle of "poor ore not entering the pit, not leaving the mountain, and not entering the factory," implemented pit mouth sampling and testing in the mining area, carefully selected and sorted the ore, ensuring that qualified ore was transported to the factory; workers in the crushing workshop processed the ore into concentrate and ore fines, which were charged into the furnace separately. This greatly overcame waste in raw materials, transportation, and other aspects. In fuel management, attention was paid to educating loading and unloading workers and crushing workers, adopting light loading and unloading and improving crushing methods to minimize losses. In the past, one ton of coke would lose more than 30%, now it only loses about 20%, thus reducing the cost of each ton of iron by more than 3.9 yuan. At the same time, the factory also strictly established a material requisition system and formulated consumption quotas, thereby blocking waste. In addition, the factory also implemented reasonable allocation in terms of organizational structure and personnel, reducing expenses and implementing the principle of running the enterprise diligently and thriftily. This played an important role in reducing costs.

    树立勤俭办企业思想加强生产管理
    盂县铁厂七个月盈利百万元
    本报太原31日电　山西省盂县铁厂发动群众改善生产管理，坚持勤俭办企业的方针，全厂小高炉的生产成本逐月下降，1至7月共盈余一百一十七万二千多元。已成为全省（小洋群）铁厂中高产、优质、低成本的一面红旗。
    盂县铁厂是在1958年大跃进中发展起来的，原来是两个小铁厂，开炉最早的也只有一年多时间。1958年全厂小高炉平均每吨生铁的成本高达二百十九元以上。年终共亏损了一万四千九百多元。为了改善这个情况，工厂党委认真分析了成本高的原因，在采取一系列改进措施的同时，并发动全厂职工展开了以降低成本为中心的高产、优质竞赛。经过了一番努力，今年上半年全厂每吨铁的成本平均降低到一百九十三元，比去年年底降低了六十六元。从4月份开始，虽然矿石、焦煤等原料和运输的价格都比第一季度提高了，但是5、6、7月份的成本仍然是逐月降低。到7月份，全厂每吨铁的成本由上半年的一百九十三元降低到一百八十九元。
    在高产、优质的竞赛运动中，厂党委一边帮助各车间具体算帐大抓生产管理，一边组织工人加速提高生产水平，有效地促使成本逐月降低。他们在具体算帐中发现，全厂利用系数每提高零点一吨，每吨铁的成本就可以降低六点三二元；劳动效率提高一倍，每吨铁的成本就可以降低三点五九元。针对算帐中发现的材料，党委及时组织工人展开讨论，把降低成本的中心放在高产、优质、高效率的方面。紧接着，一个以高产优质高效率为中心内容的社会主义竞赛运动在全厂蓬勃开展了起来。
    在产量、质量、效率迅速提高的同时，党委又及时采取措施纠正了企业中日渐滋长的不计成本的浪费现象，发动工人把厉行节约，勤俭办企业，作为竞赛的一项重要内容。为此，他们先从加强原料管理入手，努力降低耗损率。采矿场工人采取“贫矿不上坑、不下山、不进厂”，在矿区实行了坑口选样化验，精选细挑，保证把合格矿石运到工厂；粉碎车间工人加工成成矿和矿末，分别入炉。大大克服了原料、运输等各方面的浪费；在燃料管理上，注意教育装卸工人和粉碎工人，采取轻装、轻卸和改进粉碎方法，尽量减少损耗，过去一吨焦炭要损耗30％以上，现在仅损耗20％左右，每吨铁的成本费因此就减少了三点九元多。同时，厂里并严格建立了领发料制度和制订了消耗定额，从而堵绝浪费现象。此外，这个厂并在机构人员上实行了合理调配，减少了开支，贯彻了勤俭办企业的方针。对降低成本起了重要作用。
