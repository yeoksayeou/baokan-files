    Tanggu Fishermen Determined to Increase Fish and Shrimp Production by 2 Million Jin This Year

Xinhua News Agency, Luda, September 5th: The broad masses of workers and fishermen on the Luda aquatic product front, responding to the Party's call, are determined to increase aquatic product output by 5,000 tons in September to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    In July and August of this year, Luda aquatic product workers and fishermen broke with the conventional off-season practices and launched a high tide of production during the closed fishing season with no idle people and no idle boats, turning the off-season into a productive peak season. The city's aquatic product production in two months increased by 25% compared to the same period last year.

    Now, fishermen and workers have put forward their guarantees one after another. Fishermen in Changhai County proposed to guarantee the completion of the third quarter fishing plan of 5,000 tons ahead of schedule, and strive to complete the annual plan of 21,500 tons of aquatic products two months ahead of schedule, and strive to increase production by 3,000 tons. They used this as a condition to challenge various counties and cities. This challenge was immediately responded to by four regions including Zhuanghe, Lushun, Xinjin, and Fuxian. Currently, most of the fishing boats have been repaired, equipped with nets, and set sail to the open sea to catch large prawns, yellow croakers, and hairtail. All idle boats and idle people have also been mobilized. Some fishermen are gathering in the near sea to engage in shellfish, algae, and jellyfish fishing. Some areas are also raising seedlings in the port for planned freshwater fish production. Scouting boats and command boats are also frequently active at sea, strengthening fish condition reconnaissance.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 5th: A fishing battle is unfolding on the vast Hongze Lake. Inspired by the call of the Party Central Committee, the fishermen are full of energy, and the average daily output has soared from 20,000 to 30,000 Jin in early August to about 200,000 Jin currently. On the lakeside highway, dozens of fully loaded ten-wheel trucks are transporting the fish and shrimp they catch to cities such as Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Changzhou day and night.

    Hongze Lake is more than 500 li in circumference and is the main freshwater fish production area in Jiangsu Province. The current time is a great opportunity for fishing. The Hongze County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a fishing season production command headquarters. In addition to the 30,000 fishermen in the lake, it also transferred more than 40,000 people from the people's communes on land to participate in fishing, processing, and transportation. In order to increase production, the fishermen used all their "eighteen kinds of martial arts." Wang Guangjin, a fishing expert, used small tools such as firewood hooks, small cards, and round forks for fishing in addition to large weirs. Employees of local commercial departments also greatly encouraged their efforts, and tried every possible means to transfer a large number of materials such as Mao bamboo, pig blood material, and firewood to meet the needs of fishermen to supplement production tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 5th: When the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were transmitted to Sansha Town, a famous fishing port in Fujian Province—more than 10,000 members who returned from the sea and those repairing boats and weaving nets at home gathered in various fishing villages to hold mobilization radio rallies, determined to continue riding the east wind and breaking through the giant waves. They will work hard for four months, and use the actual action of increasing fish and shrimp production by 5 million jin more than last year to respond to the Party's militant call.

    Sansha Commune is a relatively large-scale people's commune in the coastal area of ​​Fujian Province mainly engaged in marine fishing. This year, the commune gave full play to the superiority of its large population and extensive business scope, and established various professional teams for fishery, agriculture, and transportation, so that various productions have been fully developed. Three thousand seven hundred and ninety members of the fishery professional team, because they solved the contradiction between fishing and farming, traveled on the ocean all year round without any worries, and concentrated on fishing production, so that this year's spring and summer fishing season, despite strong winds and heavy rains, has gained a special bumper harvest of more than 1.3 million jin of fish and shrimp more than last year during the Great Leap Forward. After hearing the Party's call, the broad masses of members worked even harder. The members of the Sanwo production team, who originally planned to suspend fishing for repairs and prepare for the winter fishing season production, held a Zhuge Liang meeting to increase their efforts and find measures, and decided to divide the twenty fishing boats into four batches for repair by adopting the method of "boats stop, nets don't stop, and repairs are carried out in turn." While preparing the hairtail nets, the pomfret gillnets on the ships that were suspended for repairs were distributed to other fishing boats for use. They re-revised the leap forward indicators, requiring that the autumn and winter fishing season output be doubled compared with the same period last year. In addition, the commune also decided to use public accumulation to add 50 sampans and a batch of fishing gear to expand production. Now, the fishermen are using a variety of fishing gear to implement simultaneous and rotational operations, and have caught more than 154,400 jin of fish and shrimp in three days, an increase of 4.4 times compared to the same period last year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: After studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the fishermen on Ant Island in the Zhoushan Islands have become more enthusiastic and decided to catch 4 million jin more fish than originally planned during the autumn fishing season, and strive to complete the plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    Ant Island is a small island in the Zhoushan Islands. All the fishermen on the island have joined the Ant People's Commune. This commune had an unprecedented bumper harvest this summer fishing season, catching a total of 8.24 million jin of fish, doubling the production target. The original plan for the autumn fishing season was to catch 9.4 million jin of fish, and now the members have decided to increase it to 13.4 million jin.

    For the past three days, the fishing competition in the Ant Commune has been in full swing, with members catching up with each other and racing against time. Every day, as soon as the fish belly white appeared in the east, more than 60 fishing boats of the commune set sail and headed for the more than 3,000 fishing nets fixed in the sea with bamboo piles to scoop up the fish. Scooping up the fish on the sea off the south of the island is the fourth production team, which has won the competition red flag continuously. Although the fishermen on each boat in this team are half as many as other fishing boats, each person is very quick and scoops up one net after another, never stopping. The second production team, which is harvesting fish on the sea off the east of the island, is also determined to win the competition's red flag. Squad leader Hu Shengtian and boat boss Hu Aqing are competitors. Hu Shengtian gets up early, goes to sea early, and scoops up the nets quickly. He has the highest unit output in the whole team, and he often helps others scoop up the nets. Hu Aqing has also significantly increased his output with his own efforts and the help of others in the competition.

    At night, the vast sea around Ant Island is scattered with fishing lights. More than 100 members who are taking advantage of the low tide to drive piles are working hard to drive one bamboo into the seabed as a stake for setting up nets for fishing. They know that driving one more pile and setting up one more net will catch thousands of jin of fish. Therefore, they drive during the day and drive at night, seize the opportunity of low tide, and make a tense breakthrough. In three days, the whole commune has added more than 300 new piles.

    As the main force of logistics, more than 400 female members are also determined to fight hard for four days to weave and knot the newly purchased 400 fish nets, repair the old nets, and support the front line to set up more nets and catch more fish.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 5th: The members of the Tanggu District Fishery Commune, fighting in Bohai Bay, under the militant call of the Party Central Committee, are greatly encouraged and determined to overfulfill the annual fishing plan by 25%, increasing fish and shrimp production by 2 million jin compared to last year. The autumn fishing season production has achieved initial success. In August, a total of more than 1.97 million jin of fish and shrimp were caught, an increase of about 75% compared to July.

    Fishery members resolutely overcame the difficulties of strong winds and heavy rains this year, and put forward many measures to increase production. Many production brigades used to only be able to fish on the sea surface with a water depth of 30 to 35 feet. Now, under the premise of ensuring safe production, they use existing boats and equipment to fish on the sea surface with a water depth of 60 feet, and implement the method of pulling one more net per boat per day. They also publish the daily production situation, evaluate each tide, and promote each other. Therefore, production is rising day by day, and the average daily output has jumped from 71,400 jin in late August to the current 116,000 jin.

    旅大水产职工和渔民在今年7、8月打破歇伏常规，掀起了一个无闲人、无闲船的伏季生产高潮，把淡季变成了丰产的旺季。全市两个月生产的水产品比去年同期增长了25％。
    现在，渔民和职工们又纷纷提出保证。长海县渔民提出要保证提前完成第三季度捕鱼五千吨的计划，争取全年二万一千五百吨水产品计划提前两个月完成，力争增产三千吨，并以此为条件向全市各县提出了挑战。这个挑战立即得到了庄河、旅顺、新金、复县等四个地区的应战。目前大部分渔船已经修好，备齐了网具，扬帆到远海去捕大对虾、黄花鱼和刀鱼，闲船闲人也都全部出动。有一部分渔民聚集在近海大搞贝类、藻类和大捕海蜇。有的地区还在港内纳苗放养，有计划的生产淡水鱼。探苗船和指挥船也在海上频繁地活动，加强鱼情的侦察工作。
    新华社南京5日电　广阔的洪泽湖上正在展开捕捞大战。渔民们在党中央号召的鼓舞下，干劲十足，平均日产量从8月初的两三万斤激增到目前的二十万斤左右。湖边公路上，数十辆满载的十轮卡车，正日夜不停地把他们捕捞的鱼虾运往南京、无锡、苏州、常州等城市。
    洪泽湖方圆五百多里，是江苏省淡水鱼主要产地。当前正是捕捞的大好时机。中共洪泽县委组织了渔汛生产指挥部，每天除全湖三万多渔民全部出动外，还从陆上各人民公社抽调了四万多人参加捕捞、加工和运输工作。渔民们为了增产，将“十八般武艺”一齐用上。捕鱼能手王广金，除了利用大簖以外，还利用了柴钩、小卡、圆叉等小型工具捕捞。当地商业部门职工也大鼓干劲，千方百计地调运大批毛竹、猪血料、大柴等物资，满足渔民增补生产工具的需要。
    新华社福州5日电　党的八届八中全会公报和决议传到福建省著名渔港—霞浦县三沙镇时，一万多名出海归来和在家修船织网的社员，分别集合在各渔村举行誓师广播大会，决心要继续乘东风、破巨浪，大干四个月，用比去年多增产五百万斤鱼虾的实际行动，来响应党的战斗号召。
    三沙公社是福建省沿海规模较大的以海洋捕捞为主的人民公社，今年公社充分发挥了人多力大、经营范围广的优越性，成立了渔业、农业、运输等各种专业队，使各种生产获得全面发展。三千七百九十名渔业专业队的社员，因为解决了既要捕鱼又要种地的矛盾，终年无后顾之忧地驰骋在海洋上，专心从事捕捞生产，使今年春夏鱼汛在风大雨多的情况下，获得了比大跃进的去年多捕一百三十多万斤鱼虾的特大丰收。广大社员在听到党的号召后，干劲更大。原来计划歇海修补、准备迎接冬汛生产的三沃生产队的队员们召开了加干劲、找措施的诸葛亮会，决定采用船停网不停、轮番修补的方法，把二十条渔船分成四批修理。一边准备带鱼绘、一边把停海修补的船上的鲳鱼缣分给其他渔船使用。他们重新修订了跃进指标，要求秋冬鱼汛产量比去年同期翻一番。此外，公社还决定用公共积累增置五十条舢舨和一批渔具，扩大生产。现在，渔民们正使用多种渔具，实行兼作和轮作作业，在三天中捕捞鱼虾十五万四千多斤，比去年同期增加了四点四倍。
    据新华社杭州讯　舟山群岛蚂蚁岛上的渔民在学习党的八届八中全会公报和决议后，干劲更足，决定在秋汛期间比原计划多捕四百万斤鱼，并力争提前超额完成，迎接国庆十周年。
    蚂蚁岛是舟山群岛中的一个小岛。岛上渔民全部参加了蚂蚁人民公社。这个公社今年夏汛空前大丰收，共捕鱼八百二十四万斤，比包产指标翻了一番。秋汛原定计划捕鱼九百四十万斤，现在社员们决定把它提高到一千三百四十万斤。
    三天来，蚂蚁公社捕鱼竞赛热火朝天，社员们你追我赶，分秒必争。每天东方刚出现鱼肚白，公社的六十多只渔船就扬帆出海，奔向用竹桩固定在海中的三千多张鱼网，撩网收鱼。在岛南海面上撩网收鱼的是连续获得竞赛红旗的第四生产队，这个队每只船上的渔人，虽然比其它渔船少一半，但是每个人动作十分迅速，敏捷地撩了一网又一网，时刻不停。在岛东海面上收鱼的第二生产队，也决心夺取竞赛优胜红旗。小队长胡生田和船老大胡阿青是竞赛对手，胡生田早起床，早出海，撩网快，在全队中单位产量最高，他还常去帮助别人撩网收鱼。胡阿青在竞赛中自己加劲干，又得到帮助，产量也已显著提高。
    夜晚，蚂蚁岛周围辽阔的海面上散布着点点渔火，一百多个趁着落潮的机会打桩的社员，正在紧张地把一支一支毛竹打入海底，作为张网捕鱼的桩头。他们知道，多打一根桩，多张一顶网，就能多捕千斤鱼。因此，他们白天打，晚上打，抓紧落潮时机，紧张突击，三天中，全社就已新增桩头三百多支。
    作为后勤主力军的四百多名女社员，也决心苦战四天，把新买进的四百多顶鱼网织好结好，旧网补好，支援前方多张网，多捕鱼。
    新华社天津5日电　战斗在渤海湾上的塘沽区渔业公社社员，在党中央的战斗号召下，大鼓干劲，决心超额25％完成全年捕捞计划，比去年增产两百万斤鱼虾。秋汛生产已获初捷，8月份共捕鱼虾一百九十七万多斤，比7月份增加75％左右。
    渔业社员们坚决克服今年风大、雨多的困难，提出了许多增产措施。不少生产大队过去只能在水深三十到三十五尺的海面上捕捞，现在他们在保证安全生产的前提下，利用现有船只和设备，到水深六十尺的海面上捕捞，并且实行每船每天多拉一网的办法。他们还把每天生产情况公布，潮潮评比，互相促进。因此生产逐日上升，平均日产量已由8月下旬的七万一千四百斤跃增到目前的十一万六千斤。
