In the first half of this year, the Production and Construction Corps has made great progress in agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and other aspects compared with the same period last year.

In order to strive for a greater harvest, the troops on the agricultural production front, after the summer harvest work was completed, concentrated their forces to strengthen the management of autumn fields, and strived for a bumper harvest of cotton and grain this year. At the same time, a batch of manpower was transferred to prepare for winter wheat sowing. Now, the sowing preparations are nearing completion, and in early September, some farms north of the Tianshan Mountains will begin sowing. In order to prepare feed for livestock to survive the winter, various farms have also launched feed storage work.
