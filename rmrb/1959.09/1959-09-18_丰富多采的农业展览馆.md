The rich and colorful Agricultural Exhibition Hall
By Our Correspondent Zhou Dingfang

The National Agricultural Exhibition Hall has been completed. Those who have visited it praise the architectural art of the exhibition hall, believing that it has both a unique style and national characteristics.

These days, people can see sculptors carefully shaping two huge sculptures, each eight meters high, in the large square in front of the Agricultural Exhibition Hall. The theme of the southern sculpture is "Long Live the People's Commune Where Workers, Peasants, Merchants, Students, and Soldiers are United." A robust young farmer is riding two steeds, raising a drum mallet, and striking a large drum vigorously. Surrounding him are eight men and women dressed as workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers. Each of them is radiant, smiling, and celebrating the birth of the People's Commune. The northern sculpture depicts the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side-line production, and fisheries in the People's Commune. A cornucopia, filled with wheat ears, grapes, pineapples, and other agricultural and sideline products, is carried on the backs of two galloping horses. A plainly dressed rural girl is standing on the horse, rhythmically striking cymbals. Eight men and women surround her, some planting trees, some herding sheep, some letting horses graze, some picking tea, and some fishing. They succinctly reflect the scene of 500 million farmers leaping forward with heroic strides under the illumination of the Party's General Line in the year since the establishment of the People's Commune. At the same time, they express the desire and enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to continue the Great Leap Forward. These two sculptures, majestic and full of enthusiastic atmosphere, are the collective creation of teachers and students of the Sculpture Department of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts after they went deep into the countryside to experience life.

In the square, the architect who designed this project gave us an overview of the scale and design process of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall. He said that the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall was built to exhibit the great achievements on the agricultural front in the past ten years, especially the achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year, and to exchange and promote advanced experiences. It consists of twelve parts, including the Comprehensive Hall, the Crop Hall, the Forestry Hall, the Animal Husbandry Hall, the Special Products and Horticulture Hall, the Aquatic Products Hall, the Agricultural Science Hall, and the Meteorological Hall, with a total construction area of more than 28,000 square meters. In order to avoid excessive concentration of the audience, excessively long visiting routes, and excessive dispersion, which would make management difficult, the twelve halls are arranged into four building groups in the layout, scattered on about 50 hectares of land. The surrounding area is treated in a garden style, with large green spaces and flower beds, so that visitors can walk and rest here after the visit. In architectural art, traditional Chinese techniques such as attracting people with scenery, adapting to local conditions, and borrowing scenery with implicit meaning are adopted to achieve richness and diversity, so that visitors are full of interest after the visit.

The center of the Agricultural Exhibition Hall is the Comprehensive Hall. It is taller than the other halls, and its modeling art is rich and colorful. On top is a three-story, double-eaved octagonal pavilion, and the two wings are single-story, double-eaved roofs. On the granite steps, there are bas-reliefs of grapes, bananas, apples and other fruits that seem to be dripping with honey. The railings on both sides are decorated with wheat ears and cotton bolls. In the middle of the Comprehensive Hall is the central hall, where a plaster sculpture of Chairman Mao having a cordial conversation with farmers is displayed. The middle-aged farmer is gesticulating as he reports to Chairman Mao. Judging from the excited expression on his face, the farmer seems to be telling about the happy life after the collectivization. A young peasant woman and a child are also sitting next to him, and the child is affectionately holding Chairman Mao's hand. Behind the sculpture is a nine-meter-high bas-relief that combines romanticism and realism, depicting the People's Commune celebrating the harvest and the soaring enthusiasm of 500 million farmers. In the middle of the bas-relief, a farmer is stepping on clouds and carrying the moon and the sun on his shoulders. Another farmer is holding a dragon and ordering it to divert water for irrigation, symbolizing the power of the people to reverse the universe. The upper part of the bas-relief is the vision of the People's Commune, with many factories, blast furnaces, and hydroelectric power stations in the distance. In the foreground, farmers are learning science. At the bottom of the bas-relief is a scene of people joyfully celebrating the bumper harvest of the five industries. Around the central hall are three huge slogans hanging, which read: "Long Live the General Line," "Long Live the Great Leap Forward," and "Long Live the People's Commune."

Walking north from the Comprehensive Hall is the Crop Hall, and turning east is the Local Specialty Hall. Opposite these two halls are the Measures Hall and the Science Hall. These halls are all unique in style. Some have round colored glass canopies, some have square coffered canopies, and some are all decorated with wood. However, they have one common feature: the walls and floors are mainly light-colored, and the decorations are patterned with various agricultural and sideline products. The halls are bright and people will feel refreshed and comfortable when visiting the exhibits. These halls are connected to each other by quaint corridors, forming a beautiful group of buildings.

Walking south through a circular square, you come to the Meteorological Hall. Its roof is semi-circular, equivalent to the top of a four-story building, decorated with a tower base composed of wheat ears and clouds, but from inside the hall, the color of the canopy looks like a blue sky. In the southwest of the hall, there is also a circular open-air exhibition field, where meteorological observation instruments are set up for on-site demonstration and meteorological observation. In this hall, people will be able to understand the impact of climate on crops and help people establish the belief that man will conquer nature.

To the east of the Meteorological Hall is the Aquatic Products Hall. It consists of three parts: the Crystal Palace, the Aquatic Animals Exhibition Hall, and the Plants Exhibition Hall. The color of the outer wall is lake green, and the lower part is decorated with sea waves, as if the entire building is built on the water. The architect here adopted the fascinating design technique of "another village after passing through dark willows and bright flowers." The walls on both sides of the entrance to the Aquatic Animal Exhibition Hall are inlaid with aquatic animal patterns such as "shells" and "conches," and four "fish" form the top lamps of the exhibition hall. In the exhibition hall, plaster fish are swimming in plaster waves. The Aquatic Plant Exhibition Hall on the south side is the same style, and the canopy in the hall is decorated with plaster flowers such as aquatic plants, lotus flowers, and corals. The Crystal Palace is in the middle of the Aquatic Products Hall, and its outer wall is composed of twelve circular arches.

Opposite the Aquatic Products Hall is the Animal Husbandry Hall. The central part is circular, and the two wings extend backwards, making the body appear light and lively, simple and generous. On the huge windows, inlaid with iron flowers, a traditional Chinese folk art, are cast images of sheep, horses, and sika deer. To the northeast of the Animal Husbandry Hall, there is also a live animal exhibition field, where cattle, sheep, pigs, and various excellent breeds of fur animals will be exhibited. It will be like a small zoo.

According to the plan, more than 90% of the entire exhibition hall is green space. Currently, gardeners are planting trees around the hall. In the future, after visitors finish the exhibition, they can take a walk in the woods, row a boat on the lake, or lean on the railing by the lake and overlook the surrounding scenery, which will be refreshing and pleasing to the eye, and can quickly eliminate fatigue.

Returning to the Comprehensive Hall, we arrived at the three-story double-eaved octagonal pavilion on the top of the hall. A parasol-shaped chandelier surrounded by olive leaves hangs under the canopy. This hall has more than forty kinds of lamps, which are novel in style and add color to the building. The four types of street lamps installed around the building are either wheat ear-shaped, candle-shaped, or the lamp poles are bright all over.

In the octagonal pavilion, you can have a panoramic view of the entire hall. The gate of the hall faces Dongzhimen, and is connected to the planned third ring road, making transportation convenient. The east side will be a lake area of the Water Mill Park. The surrounding environment makes it even more elegant and beautiful.

    丰富多采的农业展览馆
    本报记者　周定舫
    全国农业展览馆落成了。参观过的人，都称赞这座展览馆的建筑艺术，认为它既有独特风格，又有民族特点。
    这几天，人们在农业展览馆前面的大广场上可以看到雕塑工人正在精心塑造两座八米高的巨大雕塑。南面一座的主题思想是“工农商学兵互相结合的人民公社万岁”。一个体格健壮的青年农民骑在两匹骏马上，高举鼓锤，猛击大鼓。周围围绕着工农商学兵装束的八个男女，他们个个容光焕发，笑逐颜开，欢庆人民公社的诞生。北面一座是表现人民公社农林牧副渔全面发展的情景。在两匹奔驰着的马背上，驮着一个聚宝盆，盆内满装着麦穗、葡萄、菠萝等农副产品。一个装束朴实的农村姑娘站在马上，正在有节奏地打钹。周围围着八个男女，有的在植树，有的在牧羊，有的在放马，有的在采茶，有的在捕鱼。它们简括地反映了人民公社成立一周年来，五亿农民在党的总路线照耀下，以豪迈的步伐向前跃进的景象。同时，又表现了广大人民继续大跃进的愿望和热情。这两座气魄雄伟、充满热情气氛的雕塑，是鲁迅艺术学院雕塑系的师生深入到农村体验生活后，集体创作的。
    在广场上，设计这项工程的建筑师，向我们概述了全国农业展览馆的规模和设计经过。他说，全国农业展览馆是为了展览十年来农业战线上的伟大成就特别是去年大跃进的成就，和交流推广先进经验而兴建的。它由综合馆、农作物馆、林业馆、畜牧馆、特产园艺馆、水产馆、农业科学馆和气象馆等十二个部分组成，建筑面积总共达二万八千多平方米。为了不使观众过分集中，参观路线过长，又不过于分散，以致难于管理，在平面布局上，将十二个馆组成四个建筑组，分散地布置在五十公顷左右的土地上。周围加以庭园式处理，布置了大片绿地花坛，使观众参观以后可以在这里散步休息。在建筑艺术上，采用了我国传统的引人入胜、因地制宜、借景含蓄等手法，做到丰富多彩，使参观者观后余兴盎然。
    农展馆的中心是综合馆。它比别的馆高，造型艺术丰富多彩。顶上是一座三层重檐的八角阁，两翼是单层重檐屋顶。在花岗石的台阶上，塑造着好像一碰就会溅出蜜浆来的葡萄、香蕉、苹果等浮雕，两旁栏杆上塑着麦穗和棉桃等花饰。综合馆的中间是中央大厅，里面陈列着毛主席同农民亲切谈话的石膏雕塑。那个壮年农民用手势比划着在向毛主席汇报。从脸部激动的表情看来，这个农民似乎是在诉说公社化后的幸福生活。旁边还坐着一个青年农妇和一个小孩，小孩亲热地拉着毛主席的手。雕塑背后，是一幅浪漫主义和现实主义相结合的九米高的浮雕，它描绘了人民公社欢庆丰收和五亿农民的冲天干劲。浮雕当中，一个农民脚下踩着云朵，肩上挑着月亮和太阳。另一个农民手里牵着一条蛟龙，命令它引水浇田，象征着人民扭转乾坤的力量。浮雕上部是人民公社的远景，远处是一望无边的许多工厂、高炉和水力发电站等建筑。近处是农民正在学习科学。浮雕底下，是人们喜气洋洋地欢庆五业丰收的景象。中央大厅周围，悬挂着三组巨大的标语，上面写着：“总路线万岁”“大跃进万岁”“人民公社万岁”。
    综合馆往北走，是农作物馆，往东拐是土特产馆。和这两个馆相对称的是措施馆和科学馆。这些馆都别具风格，有的是圆形的彩色玻璃顶篷，有的是方格形的藻井顶篷，也有全部装修都是木制的。但是，它们有一个共同的特点，墙面和地面都是以浅色为主，装饰都以各种农副产品作为图案。馆内光线明朗，人们在参观展品时，将会感到清新和舒畅。这些馆相互之间，是用古色古香的长廊联接起来的，构成一组优美的建筑。
    往南走过一个圆形广场，就来到气象馆。它的屋顶是半圆形的，相当于四层高楼的顶上装饰着用麦穗和云朵组成的塔座，但从馆内看上去，顶篷的颜色又像蔚蓝的天空。馆的西南面还有一个圆形露天展览场，设置气象观测仪器，作为实地表演并作气象观测之用。人们在这个馆内，将能了解气候对农作物的影响，帮助人们树立人定胜天的信念。
    气象馆的东面，是水产馆。它是由水晶宫、水产动物和植物展览厅三个部分组成。外墙的颜色呈湖绿色，下部饰有海水的浪花，好像整个建筑建在水面上一样。建筑师在这里采用了“柳暗花明又一村”的引人入胜的设计手法。水产动物展览厅大门入口两旁的墙壁上，镶嵌着“贝壳”、“海螺”等水产动物的花饰，四条“鱼”组成了展览厅的顶灯。展览厅内，用石膏制成的鱼正在石膏浪花里游着。南面的水产植物展览厅式样和它一样，厅内顶篷上塑造的是水草、荷花、珊瑚等石膏花饰。水晶宫在水产馆的当中，它的外墙是用十二个圆拱组成的。
    和水产馆遥遥相对的是畜牧馆。中央部分是圆形的，两翼往后伸延，体型显得轻巧活泼、朴素大方。在巨大的窗户上，嵌着我国民间传统的艺术——铁花、铸造着羊、马和梅花鹿的形象。畜牧馆的东北面，还有活牲畜展览场，在这里，将展出牛、羊、猪以及各类优良品种的皮毛兽等。它将像一个小的动物园。
    根据规划，整个展览馆有90％以上的面积是绿地。目前，园林工人正在馆的周围栽植树木。将来，观众们看完展览以后，在树林中散散步，在湖水中划划船，或是倚在湖旁栏杆上眺望周围景色，爽心悦目，能够迅速地消除疲劳。
    回到综合馆，我们到达馆顶的三层重檐的八角阁。顶篷下面吊着一盏橄榄叶围成的伞形吊灯。这个馆共有四十多种灯，式样新颖，给建筑物增色不少。装在建筑物周围的四种路灯，有的是麦穗形的，有的是腊烛形的，有的灯杆上下全身通明。
    在八角阁内，可以鸟瞰全馆景色。馆的大门，正对着东直门，与规划中的第三环行路相联，交通方便。东面将来是水碓公园的一片湖面。周围环境把它衬托得更加优雅美丽。
