    Ode to Miaofeng Mountain
  　Guo Huang
You are a heroic mountain, your verdant pine forest is like an umbrella, the strange rocks in the fields are surrounded by cooking smoke, and the white mist is wrapped in a rising sun. The mountain wind shakes your stout pine cones, sending the rich fragrance of roses from ten miles away, in the clear stream is a village girl's mirror-like reflection, and on the rocky mountain there is the shining of Red Army slogans. Your flying springs strike the electric mill, the war songs of the past have turned into a chorus of whistles, every hillside has lush orchards, and every fruit branch is bent by heroic stories... Now I follow in the footsteps of my predecessors, admiring your magnificence and battle traces, at every rustle of the mountain wind and grass it seems that the Red Army is waving, I rush forward to offer a passionate hymn!

    妙峰山礼赞
  　郭煌你是英雄的山啊，你苍翠的松林像伞，四野的异石缭绕着炊烟，白雾里裹着一片朝阳。山风摇着你硕壮的松塔，十里外送来玫瑰的浓香，清流里有村姑照人的镜子，岩山上有红军标语的闪光。你的飞泉迸击电磨响，昔日的战歌化成了汽笛的合唱，每片山坡都有繁茂的果园，每株果枝都被英雄的故事压弯……如今我沿着前人的脚印，把你的雄姿和战迹景仰，山风草动处仿佛有红军招手，我奔上前去，献一曲激情的礼赞！
