    An Ironclad Proof of the Great Leap Forward, A Symbol of High Speed
    Metallurgical Equipment Production Far Exceeds 1962 Levels
    Power Generation Equipment to Fulfill Second Five-Year Plan Three Years Ahead of Schedule
    Metallurgical Equipment: From January to August this year, 117,000 tons were produced, completing the annual plan four months ahead of schedule, exceeding the 30,000-40,000 ton target for the end of the Second Five-Year Plan by several times; the total annual production capacity of these equipment is: more than 2 million tons of steelmaking, more than 4 million tons of ironmaking, and more than 2 million tons of steel rolling.
    Power Generation Equipment: From January to August this year, 1.15 million kilowatts were produced, equivalent to 76%-82% of the 1.4-1.5 million kilowatt target for the end of the Second Five-Year Plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: A great leap forward victory has been reported in China's metallurgical equipment manufacturing industry: from January 1st to August 20th this year, a total of 117,000 tons of metallurgical equipment were produced, completing the annual state plan more than four months ahead of schedule. The output of metallurgical equipment in the first eight months of this year has already exceeded the target of 30,000 to 40,000 tons for 1962 set by China's Second Five-Year Plan by several times.
    Among the metallurgical equipment that China has completed or is completing this year, there are more than ten sets of open-hearth furnace equipment, with a total steelmaking capacity of more than 2 million tons per year. A total of more than forty sets of rolling mills have been produced this year, including three primary rolling mills with an annual processing capacity of hundreds of thousands of tons of steel billets; nineteen sets of sheet rolling mills with a total production capacity of more than 380,000 tons of sheet per year; and sixteen sets of section steel rolling mills with a total capacity of more than 2 million tons of steel per year. In addition, there is also a rolling mill with an annual output of 15,000 tons of seamless steel pipes. More than sixty sets of blast furnace equipment have been produced this year, including eleven sets of large and medium-sized blast furnaces with volumes ranging from 100 cubic meters to 1,513 cubic meters. The total capacity of these blast furnace equipment is more than 4 million tons of iron per year. The metallurgical equipment produced this year also includes twenty-three sets of coke oven equipment and converter equipment with an annual output of 300,000 to 450,000 tons of coke, as well as non-ferrous metal smelting equipment.
    This metallurgical equipment is a strong new force to ensure that China completes its leap forward plans for steel, iron, and steel materials this year, and to ensure the continued high-speed development of China's metallurgical industry next year. At present, the machinery industry department is organizing forces to vigorously strengthen the matching of metallurgical equipment. Nineteen sets of rolling mills and other equipment that have been assembled or are basically assembled are being shipped to Baotou, Wuhan and elsewhere for installation.
   The technical level of the metallurgical equipment manufacturing industry in China has also basically leaped to the level of 1962. The 1,513 cubic meter blast furnace with an annual output of more than 800,000 tons of iron and the open-hearth furnace with a daily output of 500 tons, which were manufactured this year, were originally planned to be produced only in 1962. However, due to the Great Leap Forward in 1958, mass movements were carried out on a large scale, the masses were highly motivated, superstitions were eliminated, and workers and technicians, based on Soviet designs, began trial production last year and began formal production this year. At present, China's metallurgical equipment manufacturing industry is trial-producing a primary rolling mill with a roll diameter of 1,150 mm and an annual processing capacity of 3.2 million tons of steel billets. This world-class rolling mill was also originally scheduled to be produced in 1962, and its huge frame has been successfully manufactured. China's ability to manufacture this equipment marks that the technical level of China's modern metallurgical equipment manufacturing industry, established with Soviet assistance, in manufacturing ferrous metallurgical equipment has approached or leaped to the world level, and marks that China's metallurgical equipment manufacturing industry can use advanced technology and equipment to equip the iron and steel industry, providing a more sufficient material and technical basis for the continued high-speed development of China's iron and steel industry.
    After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a battle call to overcome right-leaning thoughts and carry out an increase production and practice economy movement, it immediately received a warm response from the vast number of cadres and workers in the metallurgical equipment manufacturing industry. The staff and workers of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant proposed to increase the production of machine products by 1,000 tons, molten steel by 7,300 tons, and large forgings by 3,000 tons on the basis of the original plan of 22,138 tons this year. The Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant held a 10,000-person mobilization meeting, resolutely responding to the Party's call with practical actions to complete or overfulfill the third quarter plan, and the entire plant has launched a high tide of a six-competition contest comparing enthusiasm, quality, variety, output, safety, and conservation. The staff and workers of other metallurgical equipment manufacturing plants are revising their targets, organizing shock teams to solve key production problems, and are determined to manufacture more blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and rolling mills for the country in September to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry continues to develop at a great leap forward speed this year. In the first eight months of this year, the country produced a total of 1.15 million kilowatts of power generation equipment, accounting for 63.9% of the annual plan of 1.8 million kilowatts. This is equivalent to 76.6% to 82.1% of the 1962 production target (1.4 million to 1.5 million kilowatts) stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan. This situation shows that it is a foregone conclusion that China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry will overfulfill the Second Five-Year Plan target three years ahead of schedule, and the fruitful results of this year's great leap forward plan for the electrical machinery manufacturing industry can be reaped as long as we continue to exert our efforts.
    This year's planned output of power generation equipment in China is 1 million kilowatts more than the 800,000 kilowatts produced in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. This is still a great leap forward plan. The output of power generation equipment in China jumped from 198,000 kilowatts in 1957 to 800,000 kilowatts in 1958, and then to 1.8 million kilowatts this year. Such continuous high-speed leaps are unprecedented. In the United Kingdom, which was the earliest to manufacture power generation equipment, the development was relatively fast after World War II, but it only increased by an average of 200,000 kilowatts per year in the twelve years from 1946 to 1958, with an average annual growth of only 10.1%. Japan's output of power generation equipment, from 200,000 kilowatts in 1932 (annual output of 200,000 kilowatts), which was equivalent to China's 1957 production level, to 1.336 million kilowatts in 1957, took twenty-five years, only 74% of China's planned output this year.
    The technical level of China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry is also advancing shoulder to shoulder with its output. The complete set of 72,500-kilowatt hydropower generation equipment, which was originally scheduled to be produced in 1960, has been successfully manufactured this year; the complete set of 25,000-kilowatt thermal power generation equipment has been produced in batches this year; and the 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine and boiler were born in the Great Leap Forward last year and this year, and the steam turbine generator is also about to be trial-produced. The speed at which China's electrical machinery industry has mastered the production technology of these products is also far beyond that of capitalist countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan. It took the United Kingdom more than ten years from the production of a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator to master the technology for producing a 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator.
    Now, the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has become a huge driving force for the staff and workers of the electrical machinery industry to overfulfill the 1962 target three years ahead of schedule. The three major power plants in Shanghai, one of the main bases of power generation equipment in China—Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, Turbine Plant, and Boiler Plant—and the three major factories of Harbin Electric Machinery, Boiler, and Turbine, and Shenyang Transformer Plant, another power generation equipment base in China, have all put forward new leap forward targets. At present, the staff and workers of the national electrical machinery industry are striving to overfulfill the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan.

    大跃进的铁证　高速度的标志
    冶金设备产量远远超过一九六二年
    发电设备将提前三年完成第二个五年计划
    冶金设备：今年头八月生产11.7万吨，提前四月完成全年计划，成倍地超过了第二个五年计划末年3—4万吨的指标；这些设备年产总能力为：炼钢二百多万吨，炼铁四百多万吨，轧钢二百多万吨。
    发电设备：今年头八月生产115万瓩，等于第二个五年计划末年140—150万瓩的76％—82％。
    据新华社6日讯　我国冶金设备制造业传来了大跃进的捷报：今年1月至8月20日共生产冶金设备一十一万七千吨，提前四个多月完成了今年全年的国家计划。今年前八个月冶金设备的产量，已经成倍地超过了我国第二个五年计划规定的1962年生产三至四万吨的指标。
    今年我国已经完成或正在完成的冶金设备中，有十多套平炉设备，这些设备炼钢的总能力为年产二百多万吨钢。今年生产的轧钢机共有四十多套，其中有年处理数十万吨以上钢坯的三套初轧机；有十九套薄板轧机，总生产能力为年产三十八万多吨薄板；有十六套型钢轧机，总能力为年产二百多万吨钢材；另外还有年产一万五千吨无缝钢管的轧机。今年生产的高炉设备共有六十多套，其中容积为一百立米到一千五百一十三立米的大、中型高炉共十一套。这些高炉设备总能力为年产四百多万吨铁。今年生产的冶金设备中，还有二十三套年产三十万到四十五万吨焦的焦炉设备和转炉设备、有色金属冶炼设备。
    这些冶金设备，是保证我国完成今年钢、铁、钢材跃进计划和保证明年我国冶金工业继续高速度发展的强大的生力军。现在，机械工业部门正在组织力量，大力加强冶金设备的配套工作。已经配成套或基本成套的十九套轧钢机和其它设备，正在陆续运往包头、武汉等地安装。
    我国冶金设备制造工业的技术水平，也基本上跃进到了1962年的水平。今年制造的容积一千五百一十三立米年产八十多万吨铁的高炉，日产五百吨的平炉，按原定计划都是在1962年才能生产的产品。但由于1958年大跃进，大搞群众运动，群众干劲冲天，破除迷信，工人和技术人员们根据苏联的设计，提前在去年动手试制，并在今年开始了正式生产。现在，我国的冶金设备制造业，正在试制轧辊直径一千一百五十毫米年处理三百二十万吨钢坯的初轧机，这种世界上第一流的轧钢机，也是原定1962年才能生产，它的巨大的机架已经制造成功。我国能够制造这些设备，标志着我国在苏联帮助下建立的现代冶金设备制造工业在制造黑色冶金设备的技术水平方面，已经接近或跃进到了世界水平，标志着我国的冶金设备制造工业，已经可以用先进的技术设备来装备钢铁工业，使我国钢铁工业继续高速度地发展有了更充分的物质技术基础。
    在党的八届八中全会发出克服右倾思想开展增产节约运动的战斗号召以后，立即得到冶金设备制造工业的广大干部和工人群众的热烈响应。太原重型机器厂的职工们提出，在今年原订计划生产二万二千一百三十八吨基础上增加机器产品一千吨，钢水七千三百吨，大型锻件三千吨。富拉尔基重型机器厂召开了万人誓师大会，坚决以完成或超额完成第三季度计划的实际行动来响应党的号召，全厂已经掀起了比干劲，比质量，比品种，比产量，比安全，比节约的六比竞赛高潮。其它各冶金设备制造厂职工正纷纷修订指标，组织解决生产关键问题的突击队，决心在9月份为国家制造更多的高炉、平炉、轧钢机，迎接国庆十周年。
    据新华社6日讯　我国电机制造工业今年又以大跃进的速度继续向前发展，今年的头八个月，全国共制造了发电设备一百一十五万瓩，占全年计划一百八十万瓩的63.9％。等于第二个五年计划规定的1962年生产指标（一百四十万到一百五十万瓩）的76.6％到82.1％。这种情况说明我国电机制造工业提前三年超额完成第二个五年计划指标已成定局，今年电机制造工业大跃进计划的丰硕果实只要继续鼓足干劲就可摘到手。
    今年我国发电设备的计划产量，比大跃进的1958年年产八十万瓩，增加了一百万瓩。这仍然是一个大跃进的计划。我国发电设备的产量从1957年的十九点八万瓩跳到1958年的八十万瓩，再跳到今年的一百八十万瓩。这样连续的高速度的跳跃是史无前例的。世界上制造发电设备最早的英国，在第二次世界大战以后发展是比较快的，但它从1946年到1958年十二年中，每年平均也才仅仅增加二十万瓩，平均每年也只增长10.1％。日本的发电设备产量，从相当于我国1957年生产水平的1932年（年产二十万瓩）到1957年，经过了二十五年的时间也才达到了一百三十三万六千瓩，仅及我国今年计划产量的74％。
    我国电机制造工业的技术水平，也和它的产量并肩跃进。原定在1960年才能生产的七万二千五百瓩成套的水力发电设备，已经在今年制造成功；二万五千瓩的成套火力发电设备今年已成批生产；五万瓩的汽轮机、锅炉已经在去年和今年大跃进中诞生，汽轮发电机也即将试制完成。我国电机工业掌握这些产品的生产技术的速度之快，也远不是英国和日本等资本主义国家所能相比的。英国从生产出二万五千瓩的汽轮发电机起，经过了十多年的时间，才掌握了生产五万瓩汽轮发电机的技术。
    现在，党的八届八中全会的决议，已经成为电机工业职工们提前三年超额完成1962年指标的巨大动力。我国发电设备的主要基地之一的上海三大动力厂——上海电机厂、汽轮机厂、锅炉厂和我国另一发电设备基地的哈尔滨电机、锅炉、汽轮机三大工厂和沈阳变压器厂等企业，都提出了新的跃进指标，现在，全国电机工业的职工们，正为提前三年超额完成第二个五年计划和超额完成今年的跃进计划而奋勇前进。
