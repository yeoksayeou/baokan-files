Comrades and friends!

    We are greatly honored by the invitation from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chairman, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the State Council of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Party and Government Delegation to attend the grand celebration of the 10th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China. We express our heartfelt thanks for this invitation.

    On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Council of Ministers, I congratulate you on this great and joyful holiday from this lofty platform. Dear comrades, today the entire Soviet people celebrate this glorious day with you. Our people extend their heartfelt respect to the hundreds of millions of Chinese people who are as close as brothers and sincerely wish you new and greater achievements in socialist construction.

    The great Chinese people's revolution is a direct continuation of the cause begun by the Russian workers and peasants under the leadership of Lenin in October 1917. As Comrade Mao Zedong correctly pointed out, the Chinese revolution has always been an integral part of the world proletarian socialist revolution begun by the Russian proletariat. The Chinese working class, headed by the Communist Party of China, was one of the first in the world to respond to the October Revolution. Holding high the banner of revolution, the Chinese Communists went through the domestic war and the sacred struggle against Japanese imperialism. The result of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people was finally the establishment of a socialist state of workers and peasants.

    Since the Great October Socialist Revolution, there has been no event in history greater in scale and significance than the victory of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese revolution has brought about a tremendous change in the balance of power on the international stage in favor of socialism, and has further consolidated the world socialist system. The victory of the Chinese revolution dealt a new and fatal blow to imperialism in one of the most important regions of the world. The First World War and the Russian October Revolution caused a crisis of colonialism, and the Second World War, the victory of the Chinese Revolution, and the formation of the world socialist system have caused the colonial system of imperialism to collapse more rapidly.

    In the past, Asia was considered a solid rear area of imperialism, where the imperialist powers could plunder and oppress the Asian people at will, subjecting them to poverty and powerlessness. Due to the defeat of the fascist bloc in World War II and the victory of the Chinese Revolution, imperialist rule in Asia was destroyed, and the people of China and many other countries in Asia achieved national freedom and independence.

    The complete and thorough victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the victory of the Chinese revolution, and the achievements of socialist construction in China and other People's Democracies in Europe and Asia, inspire the people of colonial and dependent countries, give them confidence in their own strength, and point out to them the true path to national liberation and a happy life. The people of colonial and dependent countries all over the world have seen and are deeply convinced that imperialist rule is about to collapse; as long as they act resolutely and work together, they can end the shameful colonial system forever.

    As early as more than fifty years ago, the great Lenin, based on a profound analysis of the laws of social development, concluded that the socialist revolution can triumph not only in countries with a high level of productive forces and where the working class accounts for the vast majority of the population, but also in countries with relatively underdeveloped productive forces. This wise conclusion was of great significance for the victory of socialism in Russia.

    As everyone knows, the opportunists and dogmatists of the Second International did not understand the laws of social development. They denied the possibility of the victory of the socialist revolution in Russia under the pretext that the Russian proletariat was small in number. The victorious socialist construction in the Soviet Union proved in practice that the views of the Second International "theorists" were completely absurd and unfounded. China under the rule of the Kuomintang was economically more underdeveloped than Russia under the rule of the Tsar, and the Chinese working class accounted for only a small part of the population in this vast country. But the dogmas of the Social Democratic "theorists" also went bankrupt in China, and the invincible Leninism was newly proven in the vivid practice of the socialist revolution in China.

    In our era, when there is a powerful socialist camp with truly unlimited potential, socialist construction has become a reality not only for countries with high and medium levels of development. The comprehensive fraternal support and mutual assistance among the countries of the new world system contributes to the victory of socialism in countries where productive forces are still temporarily underdeveloped. It is not difficult to understand that this situation is of great significance to the people of many Asian and African countries who are striving to break free from the shackles of political and economic dependence and embark on the path of genuine progress.

    The Chinese people have accomplished tremendous work in the ten years of the people's government, fundamentally changing the face of their country. The backward, semi-colonial, semi-feudal China, cruelly exploited by domestic and foreign exploiters, no longer exists. New China has basically completed the socialist transformation in all aspects of economic and social life. The era when almost all industrial products in China were marked with foreign labels such as "Made in America" and "Made in Japan" is gone forever. The situation has now changed completely. Thanks to the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, a solid foundation for socialist industrialization has been laid! In the countryside, more than 120 million peasant households have firmly embarked on the socialist path of development - the only path for the working peasants to get rid of generations of poverty and embark on a happy and pleasant life.

    In this way, socialist relations of production have been firmly established in urban and rural areas. Liberated China, giving full play to the infinite creative power of the masses, is now experiencing a tremendous upsurge in the national economy and culture, ensuring the continuous improvement of people's lives and advancing bravely towards the victory of socialism.

    Dear friends, we share your genuine joy and pride in the historic achievements of the People's Republic of China, and we warmly wish you new and major victories in the construction of a socialist society, in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.

    The Soviet people are well aware that the People's Republic of China has been able to achieve all these achievements because the country and the people are led by the militant, battle-hardened Communist Party of China, whose entire activity is an example of serving the interests of its own people. The Communist Party of China skillfully and creatively develops and applies the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism under the conditions of its own country. The working people of People's China rightly regard the Communist Party of China as their long-tested and recognized leader. The unprecedented labor enthusiasm of the Chinese people, its unity under the banner of socialist and communist ideas, its determination to overcome any obstacles and difficulties on the road forward - all these are the results of the great organizational and educational work of the Communist Party of China.

    The Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the Chinese people to strive to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and put forward the task of catching up with Britain in the production level of the most important industrial products in the next ten years. The plenary session criticized the right-leaning opportunist errors of some cadres in the Party who doubted the strength and enthusiasm of the Chinese people and doubted the reality of the Party's general line. There is no doubt that the resolutions of the plenary session will unite the Chinese Communists more closely around the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

    Comrades! The tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China is also a festival for the people of socialist countries who are closely cooperating to build a new life together. Everyone is happy that the achievements of each fraternal country increase the strength of the entire socialist camp.

    Please allow me to briefly talk about the achievements of the Soviet working people. The Soviet people are now experiencing a wonderful and exciting era, and their lives have entered a new historical stage, that is, the period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society. Our country is seizing the time to build the material and technical foundation of communism. The Soviet people are concentrating all their will, energy, and strength to achieve this great goal.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has formulated a broad program to implement the historic resolution of our Party's 21st Congress to achieve the fastest technological progress in all sectors of the national economy. Our Party believes that the mechanization and automation of industry and agriculture is a decisive means to rapidly increase social labor productivity and increase the production of material wealth, so that our country can reach a state of abundance in food and consumer goods in the next few years and ensure that all working people can live in well-equipped housing.

    Only with rapid technological progress can socialist production be organized on a new and higher quality basis. Lenin taught us long ago: "Those who possess high technical equipment, organization, discipline, and first-class machines will prevail" ("Complete Works of Lenin," Chinese edition, Vol. 27, p. 177). Our country is implementing these teachings of Lenin, manufacturing new means of production at an accelerated pace on the basis of the latest science and technology, improving existing means of production, utilizing the most efficient energy sources, and improving production processes. Soviet scientists, engineers, and technicians are doing everything possible to make work in factories and agriculture increasingly mechanized, to liberate people from heavy physical labor, and to shorten their working hours.

    It is precisely because of the comprehensive utilization of scientific and technological achievements and the substantial increase in social labor productivity that the working hours of all workers and staff in our country will be shortened to seven hours in 1960 (the working day for workers engaged in main work in the coal and mining industries and for workers engaged in underground labor is shortened to six hours). We are now creating favorable conditions to realize the great task put forward by the Party's 21st Congress: to make the Soviet Union the country with the shortest working day and the fewest working days per week in the world in the next few years. At the same time, the wages of workers and staff will also continue to increase. In our country, all the achievements of human wisdom in science and all the latest achievements in technological thought serve the masters of the earth - the working people.

    Comrades! Communism not only means that productive forces reach a high level, but also means that members of the new society have a high degree of consciousness and all-round development. Our Party spends great effort to carry out communist education among the workers. Our Party has achieved remarkable success in the great work on the ideological front. In the process of building socialism, the Soviet people have repeatedly demonstrated self-sacrifice and a high degree of consciousness. From the earliest communist Saturday voluntary labor to the national socialist competition to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and the mass movement to strive for the title of communist labor team - this is the Soviet people's path to victory in communism.

    Currently, a patriotic movement to learn from the famous textile worker Valentina Gaganova is unfolding in the Soviet Union. Many advanced Soviet people leave advanced work teams to work in backward work teams in order to achieve the victory of the common cause of communist construction, helping them to raise their level to the advanced level. They go to the most difficult posts, take on more work, and even willingly reduce their wages temporarily.

    This seems incredible to many people in the bourgeois world, because such noble behavior is completely incompatible with the traditions of capitalist society. Some Western propagandists even insinuate that Gaganova and those who learn from her do not help the backward voluntarily. These propagandists are very similar to the grass snake in Gorky's "Song of the Falcon." The grass snake crawling on the ground cannot understand the falcon's desire to pursue light and soar, and those who hold vulgar bourgeois views of life cannot understand the lofty feelings of the Soviets.

    People like Gaganova view life not from a narrow personal perspective, but from the perspective of the entire society. They understand that the faster backward production units raise their level to the advanced level, the higher the social labor productivity, the more products the country gets, and the better and richer the lives of all working people, including themselves.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union supports and develops every initiative of the Soviet working people aimed at accelerating our country's advance towards communism with great care. The initiatives of textile worker Gaganova, miner Mamai, collective farm mechanic Kitalov, and other advanced figures in our society demonstrate the creative spirit of the people. The Party merges these trickles into a torrent. This torrent is becoming more and more turbulent, and the waves are becoming more and more magnificent.

    Due to the creative and selfless labor of all the people in our country, our country has achieved remarkable success in developing industry and agriculture this year.

    Taking Soviet industry as an example, its development is very smooth. From January to August 1959, all industrial sectors overfulfilled the production plan, and the growth rate of production in each industrial sector exceeded the same period last year. We have every reason to make such an estimate: in 1959, the total industrial output value will increase by at least 11% compared to last year, while the original plan stipulated an increase of 7.7%. Because every 1% increase in industrial output value in 1959 is equal to 11 billion rubles, by the end of the year, the output value of our country's industry just exceeding the plan will reach 35 to 40 billion rubles.

    This year, the production of pig iron, steel, steel products, and electricity will have unprecedented growth. Our country is expected to smelt 43 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, produce 47 million tons of steel products, extract 129 million tons of oil, and produce 261 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 1959.

    Our country's socialist agriculture is also booming. Thanks to the various measures taken by the Party and the government, the average annual growth rate of agricultural output value in 1954-1958 reached 8.4%. From 1954 to 1958, the total agricultural output value of the Soviet Union increased by 50%, and grain production increased by 3.6 billion poods. The output and state purchases of meat, milk, eggs, and other products have greatly increased. During these years, the monetary income of collective farms increased by 1.6 times. Now the collective farms have 610,000 tractors and 247,000 grain combines. In such a short period of time, agriculture has made such great progress, which no capitalist country has ever done.

    A few years ago, when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union began to resolutely eliminate the errors and major shortcomings that existed in agricultural leadership at that time, many people who were ill-intentioned towards our country clamored and shouted that an agricultural "crisis" was occurring in the Soviet Union. Five years have passed, and what is the result? The bankrupt predictions of the bourgeoisie have once again lost face.

    The achievements made by the Soviet Union in developing the national economy in recent years are a reliable foundation for winning the peaceful competition between our country and the United States. The total output of milk and meat in the Soviet Union has now jumped to the first place in the world. The day is not far away when our country will catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita output of important agricultural products.

    The Soviet Union's great achievements in the development of science, culture, and art are well known. Now our country ranks first in the world in training engineering and technical personnel. In 1950, our country graduated 36,000 engineers from universities, while the United States graduated 53,000. In 1958, the situation changed greatly. Last year, the Soviet Union trained 94,000 engineers, while the United States trained only 35,000. This is a very convincing fact.

    Now even the most fanatical capitalist apologists have to bite the bullet and admit that many scientific and technological sectors in the Soviet Union are at the forefront of world scientific and technological progress. The Soviet Union was the first to build an atomic energy power station and the first to manufacture first-class jet airliners. A few days ago, the world's first giant Soviet atomic icebreaker "Lenin" set sail amidst enthusiastic cheers. The Soviets are victoriously implementing the plan to explore interstellar space. The first artificial Earth satellites were launched by our Soviet country. The cosmic rocket that became an artificial planet rose from Soviet land. The Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket to the moon is a new great achievement of science and human wisdom. This remarkable event is amazing in all aspects, whether in the successful launch of such a huge rocket into space, in the perfect control system during the rocket's long journey of nearly 400,000 kilometers, or in the rocket's arrival on the moon on time. The socialist world is victoriously opening up the road to the planets, to the universe, and opening up a new era in human life - a new era of interstellar transportation. This matter is of extremely great significance.

    The achievements made by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all countries in the socialist camp show the people of our socialist countries a more brilliant and more encouraging prospect for victoriously building socialism and communism. The Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, which the Soviet people are now striving to implement, is a plan that is more magnificent than all previous economic and cultural construction plans. It is a plan for comprehensively unfolding the construction of communism. We are proud and happy that we are the first to open up the road to this society. We are strong, powerful, united, and fully armed with modern science and technology as we march towards communism. No force can stop us from achieving this great goal.

    We are very happy that the great Chinese people and the people of all socialist countries are victoriously marching towards a bright future together with us. The cooperation of socialist countries is a reliable fortress of world peace and progress, and is the most powerful force in the world, which all mankind looks upon with hope.

    Socialist countries, which are developing their economy and culture smoothly, are very concerned about maintaining lasting international peace. They have always been unswervingly opposed to the threat of war. Consolidating world peace and ensuring the peaceful coexistence of all countries with different social systems is the general policy of all socialist countries' foreign policy.

    The Soviet Union, like all socialist countries, is always ready to conduct any negotiations and take any measures sufficient to ensure lasting peace throughout the world. Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev's visit to the United States is a vivid manifestation of the desire of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries to eliminate the "Cold War" and international tensions. Comrade Khrushchev visited the United States as an envoy of peace. Now, as his visit is about to end, it can be said without exaggeration that Comrade Khrushchev gloriously, excellently, decisively, firmly, and with great perseverance and Lenin-like principles, implemented and defended the policies of all socialist countries and all peace-loving people, and implemented and defended the policy of consolidating world peace.

    The talks between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, which were conducted in a frank and fairly understanding atmosphere, Khrushchev's conversations with other American leaders, and his meetings with the American people undoubtedly have great significance for easing international tensions.

    For a long time, the relations between the major countries with different social systems have been filled with the atmosphere of the Cold War, and this situation has now improved somewhat. This is possible entirely because of the growing power of the socialist camp, which has brought about a major change in the balance of power on the international stage in favor of socialism, and entirely because the struggle to consolidate peace is becoming more and more magnificent on all continents of the world.

    However, it would be too naive to think that international tensions will continue to ease automatically. In the countries of monopoly capitalism, especially in the United States and West Germany, there are still some forces that are一心in pursuing the arms race and一心want to maintain the state of the Cold War. A dangerous situation still exists in the world. War must be stopped, because in our century, in the century of atomic and rocket technology, war will bring infinite pain and disaster to mankind. There is no doubt that the possible easing of the international situation will certainly promote all ordinary people in the world to strengthen the struggle to defend peace. As long as the people of all countries engage in this struggle, war can be prevented. The Soviet Union's plan for universal and complete disarmament of all countries, which was recently submitted to the United Nations for discussion, reflects the ardent aspirations of all ordinary people in the world and opens up the path to achieving genuine and lasting peace.

    In the common struggle to defend peace, which is in line with the vital interests of all mankind, the people of Asian countries, who account for more than half of the world's population, play a very important role. Their desire to live in peace is entirely understandable. Because it was in Asia that the atomic bomb was first exploded, and after the end of World War II, the Pacific and Indian Oceans surrounding Asia have become places where some Western countries test lethal thermonuclear weapons.

    Socialist countries have always supported in the past and will continue to support in the future the just struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against the preparation for new wars, to completely eliminate the shameful colonial system, and to consolidate national independence. Socialist countries firmly support the desire of Asian and African countries to develop their own economies. We are assisting all countries in Asia and Africa, and as our capabilities grow, we will provide them with greater assistance in the future. The people of Asian and African countries have seen more than once that the socialist camp is their most loyal and reliable friend. Because of this, the friendship between socialist countries and non-socialist countries in Asia and Africa is constantly growing. We are proud of this friendship, and we will do everything possible to make this friendship stronger day by day.

    Of course, this friendship is not to the taste of the imperialists. They are trying their best to alienate the relations between socialist countries and non-socialist countries, and to alienate the relations between communists and other progressive forces in the national liberation movement in Asia and Africa. The imperialist countries have not abandoned their consistent policy of enslaving all small and weak countries at all. It's just that they are now implementing this policy by other means. The establishment of the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, formerly the Baghdad Pact Organization, is one of these means; the Baghdad Pact Organization had to rush to change its signboard because it was driven out of the city where it was born. It is obvious that the bosses of this organization, taking into account the signs of the times, did not dare to venture to name it after the capital of one of its participating countries, and gave it an abstract name. The actual manipulators of these groups - the ruling groups in the United States and Britain - are trying to prove that the above-mentioned military groups seem to be established for the interests of Asian countries. But, as the Chinese saying goes, they are挂羊头卖狗肉（hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat). The activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization clearly prove that these groups are new forms of colonialism.

    Taking the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as an example, what has it given to the people of Asian countries in the five years of its existence? The whole world knows that one of the main organizers of the anti-people rebellion in Indonesia, the main creator of tensions and armed conflicts in this region of Asia and other countries, is precisely the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The armed conflict provoked by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Laos is one of the most recent clear examples of its sabotage activities. The reactionary forces in Laos, with the support of some participating countries in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, grossly violated the Geneva Agreement.

    In order to split and weaken the peace and national liberation movement fronts of all countries, the colonial countries have recently widely used forged anti-communist slogans together with other reactionary forces. Under this banner, the imperialists are carrying out a movement against progressives in the East, organizing reactionary coups, and trying to eliminate democracy. There is no need to prove that the attempt to portray communists as enemies of the people of Asian and African countries is very absurd. Communists are the loyal sons of their own people, the most steadfast patriots, and the most loyal fighters for national independence, for peace, and for the prosperity of their motherland.

    The communists of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries have proven in practice that only they are the most loyal defenders of the interests of the working people of their own countries, and they can lead their countries better than the bourgeois and landlord parties. At the same time, communists are good at combining patriotism, love for their motherland, with the great principles of proletarian internationalism.

    Comrades! On the basis of consistent goals and consistent views, and on the basis of loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism, strong cooperation has emerged between the countries and people of the socialist system. Nearly one billion people on earth have been closely united in the new socialist world, marching towards the victory of socialism and communism in unison. What unites the people of our camp is the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and what connects us is the great and sincere friendship that is unprecedentedly close and unprecedentedly solid in the world.

    Our imperialist enemies and their echoers, the revisionists, clearly understand the great strength of the unity of socialist countries. They have tried more than once and will undoubtedly try in the future to alienate socialist countries, first of all to undermine the alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. But the struggles of these gentlemen are futile. The alliance and friendship between these two great socialist countries, the friendship of all socialist countries, is becoming more and more solid day by day and more and more unbreakable.

    An indispensable factor in the entire socialist family, the friendship of our people, is a great force that has already had and will undoubtedly have a profound and positive impact on the entire course of world history. Our friendship is strong because the friendship of our fraternal Marxist-Leninist parties - the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China - is strong.

    Selfless fraternal mutual assistance is the most important law of socialist cooperation. The Soviet Union follows this law and considers helping China and other socialist countries its internationalist obligation. I would like to mention that exactly five years ago, Comrade Khrushchev said at the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "The Chinese people can be firmly assured that the Soviet people will continue to be its reliable and loyal friend in the future, and will continue to do their best to give it help and support in the struggle to further consolidate and develop the People's Republic of China."

    Dear comrades and friends, please allow me to firmly assure you that the Soviet Union will continue to hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism in the future and will protect and consolidate our great friendship like the apple of our eye.

    Now please allow me to read the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the Council of Ministers of Soviet Union on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、书记处书记
    米·安·苏斯洛夫同志的贺词亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    中国共产党中央委员会、中华人民共和国主席、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会和国务院给了我们很大的荣誉，邀请苏联党政代表团来参加庆祝中国革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立十周年这一重大节日的盛典。我们对这一邀请表示衷心的感谢。
    我代表苏联共产党中央委员会、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团和部长会议，在这个崇高的讲台上向你们祝贺这一伟大的、欢乐的节日。亲爱的同志们，今天全体苏联人民和你们一起庆祝这个光辉的日子。我国人民向亲如手足的亿万中国人民致以衷心的敬意并真诚地预祝你们在社会主义建设中取得新的更大的成就。
    伟大的中国人民革命是1917年10月俄国工农在列宁领导下所开始的事业的直接继续。正像毛泽东同志正确指出的，中国革命从来就是俄国无产阶级所开始的世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一个组成部分。以中国共产党为首的中国工人阶级是世界上响应十月革命最早的一个。中国共产党人高举革命的旗帜经历了国内战争，经历了反对日本帝国主义的神圣斗争的烈火。中国人民英勇斗争的结果终于成立了工人农民的社会主义国家。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，在历史上还没有过比中国革命的胜利规模更大和意义更大的事件。中国革命使国际舞台上的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的巨大变化，更加巩固了世界社会主义体系。中国革命的胜利在世界上最重要的一个地区给予帝国主义以新的、致命的打击。第一次世界大战和俄国十月革命使殖民主义发生了危机，第二次世界大战、中国革命的胜利和世界社会主义体系的形成，使帝国主义的殖民体系开始更快地崩溃。
    过去，亚洲曾被认为是帝国主义的巩固的后方，帝国主义列强可以为所欲为地掠夺和压迫亚洲人民，使他们遭受贫困和处于无权状态。由于法西斯集团在第二次世界大战中被击溃，由于中国革命的胜利，帝国主义在亚洲的统治被摧毁了，中国和亚洲其他许多国家的人民取得了民族自由和独立。
    社会主义在苏联的完全的和彻底的胜利，中国革命的胜利，中国和欧亚其他各人民民主国家社会主义建设的成就，鼓舞着殖民地和附属国的人民，使他们对自己的力量有了信心，给他们指出了走向民族解放和幸福生活的真正道路。全世界殖民地和附属国的人民亲眼看到并且深信，帝国主义的统治就要垮台；只要行动坚决并且同心协力，就能够永远结束可耻的殖民制度。
    早在五十多年以前，伟大的列宁根据对社会发展规律的深刻分析就得出结论说，社会主义革命不仅可以在有高度生产力水平、工人阶级占人口的绝大多数的国家里取得胜利，而且也可以在生产力比较不发达的 国家里取得胜利。这个英明的结论对于俄国社会主义的胜利具有重大的意义。
    大家知道，第二国际的机会主义者和教条主义者不了解社会发展的规律。他们借口俄国无产阶级人数少而否认俄国社会主义革命胜利的可能性。苏联胜利的社会主义建设用实践证明了第二国际“理论家”的观点是完全荒谬的和毫无根据的。国民党统治时期的中国，比沙皇统治时期的俄国在经济上更不发达，而中国工人阶级在这个巨大国家的人口中只占很小的一部分。但是社会民主党“理论家”的教条在中国也遭到了破产，无往不胜的列宁学说在中国社会主义革命的生动的实践中得到了新的证明。
    在我们的时代，当存在着拥有真正无限潜力的强大的社会主义阵营的时候，社会主义建设已经不仅对于有高度发展水平和中等发展水平的国家成为现实的事情。新的世界体系的各国之间全面的兄弟般的支持和互助，有助于社会主义在生产力暂时还不发达的国家里取得胜利。不难了解，这种情况对于力求挣脱政治和经济依赖的锁链而走上真正进步道路的许多亚非国家的人民具有重大的意义。
    中国人民在人民政权存在的十年间完成了巨大的工作，根本改变了自己国家的面貌。落后的、半殖民地半封建的、受国内外剥削者残酷剥削的中国已经不存在了。新中国在经济和社会生活的一切方面基本上完成了社会主义改造。中国那种在几乎所有工业品上都刻有“美国造”、“日本造”等外国标记的时代一去不复返了。现在情况有了彻底的改变。由于第一个五年计划的完成，已经建立了社会主义工业化的强固基础！在农村，一亿二千万以上的农户坚定地走上了社会主义的发展道路——劳动农民摆脱世世代代的贫困而走上幸福愉快的生活的唯一道路。
    这样，在城市和乡村就巩固地确立了社会主义的生产关系。解放了的中国，发挥了人民群众的无穷的创造力量，现在正经历着国民经济和文化的巨大高涨，保证人民的生活不断改善，勇往直前地向社会主义的胜利前进。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们和你们一起为中华人民共和国具有历史意义的成就而感到真正的高兴和骄傲，我们热烈地预祝你们在社会主义社会的建设中，在政治、经济和文化生活的一切方面获得新的重大的胜利。
    苏联人民很清楚地知道，中华人民共和国能够取得这一切成就，是因为领导着国家和人民的是战斗的、在斗争中久经锻炼的中国共产党，它的全部活动都是为本国人民的利益服务的范例。中国共产党在本国的条件下巧妙地、创造性地发展和运用着马克思列宁主义的学说。人民中国的劳动者把中国共产党看作自己久经考验的和公认的领袖是公正的。中国人民的空前的劳动热情，它在社会主义和共产主义思想的旗帜下的团结，它准备克服前进道路上的任何阻碍和困难的决心，——所有这些都是中国共产党进行了巨大的组织工作和教育工作的结果。
    中国共产党中央委员会第八次全会号召中国人民为提前完成第二个五年计划而奋斗，提出了在最近十年内在最主要工业产品的生产水平上赶上英国的任务。全会批判了党内某些工作人员的右倾机会主义的错误，这些人怀疑中国人民的力量和干劲，怀疑党的总路线的现实性。毫无疑问，全会的决议一定会把中国共产党人更紧密地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的周围。
    同志们！伟大的中华人民共和国建国十周年同时也是密切合作共同建设新生活的社会主义各国人民的节日。每个兄弟国家的成就都会增加整个社会主义阵营的力量，这不能不使我们大家感到高兴。
    请允许我向你们简要地谈一谈苏联劳动人民的成就。苏联人民现在正经历着一个美好的激动人心的时代，他们的生活已经进入了一个新的历史阶段，即全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。我们的国家正抓紧建设共产主义的物质技术基础。苏联人民正在集中全部意志、干劲和力量来达到这个伟大的目标。
    苏联共产党中央委员会制定了广泛的纲领，来实现我们党第二十一次代表大会使国民经济各部门在技术上最快地取得进步的历史性的决议。我们党认为工业和农业的机械化和自动化是一种具有决定意义的手段，它能迅速提高社会劳动生产率，增加物质财富的生产，以便在最近几年内使我国在食品和消费品方面达到丰富的地步，保证全体劳动人民都能住上设备完善的住宅。
    只有在技术上取得迅速的进步，才能在新的、更高的质的基础上组织社会主义生产。列宁早就教导我们说：“占上风的是拥有高度技术装备、组织性、纪律性和头等机器的人”（“列宁全集”中文版第二十七卷第一七七页）。我们国家正在执行列宁的这些遗训，以加快的速度在最新的科学技术的基础上制造新的生产工具，改进现有的生产工具，利用效率最大的能源，改进生产的工艺过程。苏联的科学家、工程师和技术人员正在尽一切努力，使各工厂和农业中的工作愈来愈多地用机器来进行，把人从沉重的体力劳动中解放出来，缩短他们的工作时间。
    正是由于全面地利用了科学技术成就，由于社会劳动生产率的大大提高，我国的全体工人和职员的工作时间将在1960年缩短为七小时（在煤炭工业和采矿工业中从事主要工作的工人、从事地下劳动的工人的工作日缩短为六小时）。现在我们正在创造有利的条件，来实现党的第二十一次代表大会所提出的伟大任务：在最近几年内使苏联成为世界上工作日最短和每周工作日最少的国家。同时，工人和职员的工资也将不断地提高。在我国，人类智慧在科学方面取得的一切成就，技术思想所达到的一切最新的成就，都是为地球的主人——劳动人民服务的。
    同志们！共产主义不仅意味着生产力达到高度的水平，而且还意味着新社会的成员具有高度的觉悟和全面的发展。我们党花费很大的力量对劳动者进行共产主义教育。我们党在思想战线上的巨大工作获得了卓越的成就。在建设社会主义的过程中，苏联人民一次又一次地表现了自我牺牲精神和高度的觉悟。从最早的共产主义星期六义务劳动到争取提前完成五年计划的全民社会主义竞赛以及争取目前共产主义劳动队称号的群众运动，——这就是苏联人民争取共产主义胜利的道路。
    目前，在苏联正展开一个学习著名的纺织女工瓦连廷娜·加干诺娃的爱国主义运动。许多先进的苏联人为了使共产主义建设的共同事业取得胜利，离开先进的工作队到落后的工作队去工作，帮助他们提高到先进的水平。他们到最艰苦的岗位上去，承担更多的工作，甚至甘愿暂时降低自己的工资。
    这在资产阶级世界的许多人看来，是不可思议的，因为这样高尚的行为是和资本主义社会的传统完全不相容的。西方的某些宣传家甚至含沙射影地说，加干诺娃和学习她的人帮助落后者并非出于自愿。这些宣传家很像高尔基的“鹰之歌”里的黄颔蛇。在地上爬行的黄颔蛇不能理解鹰对追求光明和展翅高翔的渴望，这些抱着庸俗的资产阶级人生观的人，也不能理解苏维埃人的崇高的感情。
    像加干诺娃这样的人不是从狭隘的个人的角度，而是从整个社会的角度来看待生活的。他们懂得，落后的生产单位越快地提高到先进水平，社会劳动生产率就越高，国家得到的产品就越多，全体劳动人民，包括他们自己在内，生活也就更加美好和富裕。
    苏联共产党十分关怀地支持和发展苏联劳动人民旨在加速我国向共产主义前进的每一创举。纺织女工加干诺娃、矿工马玛依、集体农庄机械师基塔洛夫和我们社会的其他先进人物的创举，表现了人民的创造精神。党把这些涓涓细流汇成一股洪流。这股洪流越来越汹涌，波澜越来越壮阔。
    由于我国全体人民的创造性的忘我的劳动，今年我国在发展工业和农业方面取得了卓越的成就。
    拿苏联工业来说，它的发展非常顺利。1959年1月至8月，所有工业部门都超额完成了生产计划，各工业部门的生产增长速度都超过了去年的同一时期。我们有一切理由作这样一个估计：1959年工业总产值将比去年至少增长11％，而原来计划规定增长7.7％。因为1959年工业产值每增加1％等于一百一十亿卢布，所以到年底，我国工业单是超计划完成的部分的产值就将达到三百五十至四百亿卢布。
    今年生铁、钢、钢材和电力的生产都将有空前的增长。我国预计在1959年将炼出四千三百万吨生铁、六千万吨钢，生产四千七百万吨钢材，开采一亿二千九百万吨石油，生产二千六百一十亿度电。
    我国的社会主义农业也正在蓬勃发展。由于党和政府采取了各种措施，在1954—1958年农业产值每年平均增长速度达到8.4％。1954—1958 年苏联农业总产值增加了50％，谷物产量增加了三十六亿普特。肉类、牛奶、蛋类和其他产品的产量和国家采购量都大大增加。在这几年中，集体农庄的货币收入增加了一点六倍。现在集体农庄拥有六十一万部拖拉机和二十四万七千台谷物联合收割机。在这样短短的时期内，农业取得了这样巨大的进展，这是任何一个资本主义国家从来都没有做到的。
    几年以前，当苏联共产党开始坚决消除当时在农业领导方面存在的错误和重大缺点的时候，许多对我国不怀好意的人大嚷大叫，说苏联发生农业“危机”。五年过去了，结果怎样呢？资产阶级的不灵验的预言又一次丢尽了脸。
    近年来苏联在发展国民经济方面所取得的成就，是我国同美国和平竞赛取得胜利的可靠基础。苏联的牛奶和肉类的总产量现在就已经跃居世界第一位。我国在按人口平均计算的重要农产品产量方面赶上并超过美国的日子已经不远了。
    苏联在发展科学、文化、艺术方面的巨大成就是人所共知的。现在我国在培养工程技术人材方面占世界第一位。1950年我国高等学校毕业的工程师是三万六千人，而美国是五万三千人。1958年情况有极大的变化。去年一年苏联培养出来的工程师有九万四千人，而美国只有三万五千人，这是很有说服力的事实。
    现在甚至最狂热的资本主义辩护士也不得不硬着头皮承认，苏联的许多科学技术部门在世界科学技术进步中走在最前面。苏联第一个建成了原子能发电站，第一个制造出第一流喷气式客机。前几天，世界上第一艘巨大的苏联原子破冰船“列宁号”在热烈的欢呼声中启航。苏联人正在胜利地实现探索星际空间的计划。第一批人造地球卫星是我们苏维埃国家发射的。成了人造行星的宇宙火箭是从苏维埃土地上升起的。苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭是科学和人类智慧的新的伟大成就。这桩了不起的事件在各方面，无论在成功地向宇宙发射这样巨大的火箭方面，在火箭近四十万公里的长途飞行中完善的操纵系统方面，或者在火箭准时到达月球方面，都使人非常惊叹。社会主义世界正在胜利地开辟着通向行星，通向宇宙的道路，开辟着人类生活的新纪元——星际交通的新纪元，这件事具有极其重大的意义。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、社会主义阵营的所有国家所取得的成就，向我们社会主义国家的人民展示了更加辉煌、更加令人欢欣鼓舞的胜利建设社会主义和共产主义的前景。苏联人民现在正努力实现的发展国民经济的七年计划，是一个比以前所有的经济和文化建设计划都要宏伟的计划，这是全面展开共产主义建设的计划。我们感到自豪和幸福的是：我们第一个开辟着走向这个社会的道路。我们强大有力地、团结一致地，用现代科学技术全面武装着地走向共产主义。没有任何力量能够阻碍我们实现这个伟大的目标。
    我们很高兴，和我们一起胜利地走向光辉的未来的，有伟大的中国人民，有一切社会主义国家的人民。社会主义国家的协作，是世界和平和进步的可靠堡垒，是世界上最强大的、全人类怀着希望注视着它的力量。
    顺利地发展着经济和文化的社会主义国家，非常关心维护持久的国际间的和平。它们始终不渝地反对战争威胁。巩固世界和平，保证社会制度不同的一切国家和平共处，是所有社会主义国家对外政策的总方针。
    苏联和所有社会主义国家一样，时刻准备着进行足以保证全世界持久和平的任何谈判和采取任何措施。尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫访问美国，就是苏联和所有社会主义国家渴望消除“冷战”和国际紧张局势的鲜明表现。赫鲁晓夫同志是作为和平使者访问美国的。现在，当他的访问就要结束的时候，可以毫不夸大地说，赫鲁晓夫同志光荣地、出色地、果断地、坚定地、以极大的毅力、以列宁式的原则性贯彻了和捍卫了所有社会主义国家和爱好和平的各国人民的政策，贯彻了和捍卫了巩固世界和平的政策。
    赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔在坦率和相当谅解的气氛中进行的会谈，赫鲁晓夫和美国其他领导人的谈话，他和美国人民的会见，毫无疑问，对于缓和国际紧张局势具有巨大的意义。
    长期以来，在社会制度不同的大国的关系中，充满着冷战的气氛，这种情况现在已经有了一些改善。这所以有可能，完全是因为社会主义阵营的威力日益增长，使国际舞台上的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的重大变化，完全是因为巩固和平的斗争在世界各大洲越来越波澜壮阔。
    但是，如果认为国际紧张局势会自动地继续缓和，那就太天真了。在垄断资本主义的国家里，特别是在美国和西德，还有一些势力，一心在追求军备竞赛，一心要保持冷战状态。危险的形势仍然在世界上存在着，战争必须制止，因为在我们的世纪里，在原子和火箭技术的世纪里，战争会给人类带来无穷的痛苦和灾难。毫无疑问，国际局势的可能缓和，一定会促使全世界一切普通人加强保卫和平的斗争。只要各国人民来从事这一斗争，战争是可以防止的。苏联最近提交联合国讨论的关于各国普遍和彻底裁减军备的计划，反映了全世界一切普通人的热望，开辟了实现真正的持久和平的道路。
    在符合全人类切身利益的保卫和平的共同斗争中，占全世界人口半数以上的亚洲各国人民起着极大的作用。他们要求过和平生活的愿望是完全可以理解的。因为正是在亚洲最先爆炸了原子弹，而在第二次世界大战结束以后，环绕着亚洲的太平洋和印度洋又成了某些西方国家试验杀人的热核武器的场所。
    社会主义国家过去始终支持将来仍然支持亚非各国人民为反对准备新战争、争取彻底消灭可耻的殖民制度、争取巩固民族独立而进行的正义斗争。社会主义国家坚决支持亚非国家发展本国经济的意愿。我们援助亚非一切国家，并且随着我国能力增长的程度，今后将对它们提供更大的援助。亚非各国人民已经不止一次地看到，社会主义阵营是它们的最忠实最可靠的朋友。正因为这样，社会主义国家和亚非非社会主义国家之间的友谊在不断地增长。我们为这种友谊感到自豪，我们将尽一切力量使这种友谊一天天更加巩固。
    当然，这种友谊是不合帝国主义者的口味的。它们极力想离间社会主义国家同非社会主义国家之间的关系，离间共产党人同亚非民族解放运动的其他进步力量之间的关系。帝国主义国家根本没有放弃它们奴役各弱小国家的一贯政策。只是现在它们用别的手段来实行这种政策。侵略性的东南亚军事集团的建立以及中央条约组织即过去的巴格达条约组织就是这种手段之一；巴格达条约组织由于它被赶出了它所诞生的城市，不得不赶忙换了一个招牌。显而易见，这个组织的老板们考虑到时代的征兆，不敢冒险再用它的一个参加国的首都的名称来命名了，而给它起了一个抽象的名字。这些集团的实际操纵者——美国和英国的统治集团——企图证明，上述军事集团似乎是为了亚洲国家的利益而建立的。但是，像中国俗话所说，他们是在挂羊头卖狗肉。东南亚军事集团和中央条约组织的活动明显地证明，这些集团是殖民主义的新形式。
    以东南亚军事集团而论，在它存在五年以来究竟给了亚洲各国人民些什么呢？全世界都知道，印度尼西亚反人民叛乱的主要组织者之一、亚洲的这一地区、其他国家的紧张局势和武装冲突的主要制造者正是东南亚军事集团。东南亚军事集团在老挝挑起的武装冲突就是它最近进行破坏活动的明显例证之一。老挝的反动势力在东南亚军事集团的一些参加国的支持下粗暴地破坏日内瓦协定。
    为了分裂和削弱各国人民的和平和民族解放运动阵线，各殖民国家最近同其他反动势力一起广泛地利用伪造的反共口号。在这个旗帜下，帝国主义者在东方进行反对进步人士的运动，组织反动的政变，力图消灭民主。用不着证明，把共产党人说成是亚非各国人民的敌人的企图是非常荒谬的。共产党人是本国人民的忠实儿子，是最坚定的爱国者和争取民族独立、争取和平和自己祖国繁荣的最忠诚的战士。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的共产党人在实际上证明了，只有他们才是本国劳动人民利益的最忠实的捍卫者，他们能够比资产阶级和地主的政党更好地领导自己的国家。同时，共产党人善于把爱国主义，把对自己祖国的热爱同伟大的无产阶级国际主义原则结合起来。
    同志们！在目标一致和观点一致的基础上，在忠于无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，产生了社会主义体系的国家和人民的强有力的合作。地球上已经有将近十亿的人民，在新的社会主义世界中紧紧地团结起来，一致向着社会主义和共产主义的胜利前进。把我们阵营的各国人民团结起来的是伟大的马克思列宁主义学说，把我们联结起来的是世界上空前紧密、空前牢固的伟大和真诚的友谊。
    我们的帝国主义敌人和他们的应声虫——修正主义者清楚地了解到社会主义各国团结一致的巨大力量。他们不止一次地企图而且今后无疑地还会企图离间社会主义国家，首先是破坏苏联和中华人民共和国的同盟和友谊。但是这些先生们的挣扎是徒劳无益的。这两个伟大的社会主义国家的同盟和友谊，一切社会主义国家的友谊，一天比一天巩固，越来越牢不可破了。
    整个社会主义国家大家庭中的一个不可缺少的因素，我们人民的友谊，是一个巨大的力量，它对整个世界历史进程已经发生而且今后无疑地还会发生深刻的、良好的影响。我们的友谊之所以巩固，是因为我们的亲如兄弟的马克思列宁主义政党——苏联共产党和中国共产党的友谊是巩固的。
    无私的兄弟互助是社会主义合作的最重要的法则。苏联遵循这一法则，认为帮助中国和其他社会主义国家是自己的国际主义义务。我想提一提，整整五年以前，赫鲁晓夫同志在中华人民共和国成立五周年庆祝大会上说过：“中国人民可以坚信，苏联人民今后仍然是它的可靠的、忠实的朋友，在进一步巩固和发展中华人民共和国的斗争中仍然会尽力给它以帮助和支援。”
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们，请允许我向你们坚决保证，苏联今后仍然要高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，像保护眼珠一样保护和巩固我们伟大的友谊。
    现在请允许我宣读苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和苏联部长会议庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的贺词。（贺词全文见第二版）（附图片）
