    Dongpeng Commune Has Sufficient Funds and Strength
    All Rice Fields Achieve Electric Irrigation
    (Our Dispatch) Dongpeng People's Commune in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, relying on the commune's great strength, has enabled all nearly three thousand mu of paddy fields in the commune to achieve electric irrigation, ensuring no waterlogging even with continuous heavy rain and a guaranteed harvest even without rain all year round.
    Dongpeng Commune is located on the Hangjiahu Plain, with abundant water sources and fertile land. However, in the past, the rivers were not connected, and the fields were low-lying, suffering either from drought or flooding. In some years, the area affected by drought and flood accounted for more than 70% of the total farmland.
    Last winter, the original ten advanced cooperatives here established the Dongpeng People's Commune. Seeing that the commune had sufficient funds and plenty of labor, and that all the paddy fields were used in a unified manner, the masses requested to solve the problems of drought and flood. After careful study and discussion, the commune's leading cadres decided to mobilize the masses to work hard for half a year to realize the canalization of the commune's paddy fields and the electrification of drainage and irrigation.
    The commune allocated more than 53,000 yuan to purchase nine electric motors, water pumps, belts and other materials, and built seven electric irrigation pumping stations. The lime factory and brick and tile factory run by the commune rushed to produce a large amount of lime, bricks, tiles and other raw materials, solving the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. At the same time, the state also invested 35,000 yuan to help purchase copper wire, transformers and other materials, and electrical workers worked day and night to erect transmission lines.
    In addition to a large amount of funds, the realization of electric irrigation also required sufficient labor and continuous fields to open up a channel network. The commune uniformly arranged for the entire commune's labor force to draw more than 1,300 people to form a water conservancy army, fighting hard for four months, digging and repairing a total of 300 li of main and branch channels. At the same time, land leveling was carried out throughout the commune, connecting scattered fields into large areas. In this way, the channels, which extend in all directions, are like blood vessels, covering nearly three thousand mu of farmland, transporting water to every field day and night; when there is too much accumulated water, the channels also drain the accumulated water from the fields into the rivers, ensuring smooth drainage and irrigation throughout the year.
    After the Dongpeng Commune realized electric irrigation, the spring flowering crops and early rice increased by more than 20% this year, and the area of double-cropping rice has also been greatly expanded. At the same time, because drainage and irrigation replaced manual labor and cattle-powered waterwheels, the entire commune saved nearly 200,000 workdays compared with 1958. The commune strengthened the production of agriculture, industry, and sideline industries with the more than 1,400 laborers who were used to operate water wheels last year. Therefore, this year's rush harvest and rush planting were completed ahead of schedule, and the speed ranked first in the county.
    The implementation of electric irrigation has also greatly reduced water costs and lowered agricultural costs. Compared with last year, irrigation costs can be saved by more than 70,000 yuan this year.

### 东棚公社资金足力量大  全部稻田实现电力排灌

    东棚公社资金足力量大
    全部稻田实现电力排灌
    本报讯　浙江省嘉兴县东棚人民公社依靠公社的巨大力量，使全社近三千亩水田全部实现了电力灌溉，做到了连日暴雨不受涝，一年无雨保丰收。
    东棚公社在杭嘉湖平原上，水源丰富，土地肥沃。但是过去河不成系，田地低洼，不是旱，就是涝。有几年旱涝面积占总农田的70％以上。
    去年冬天，这里原有的十个高级社建立了东棚人民公社。群众看到公社资金足、劳力多，所有水田又统一使用，就纷纷要求解决旱涝灾害问题。公社领导干部经过仔细研究讨论，决定发动群众苦战半年，实现全社水田渠网化、排灌电气化。
    公社拨出了五万三千多元购买了九台电动机和水泵、皮带等材料，建筑了七处电力灌溉机埠。公社所办的石灰厂、砖瓦厂赶制出大量石灰、砖瓦等原料，解决了原料不足的困难。同时国家也投资三万五千元帮助购买铜丝、变压器等材料，电气工人们日夜出工架设了输电线路。
    实现电力灌溉化除了需要大量资金外，其次就是要有足够的劳力和连片的田地开设渠道网。公社统一安排了全社劳力抽调了一千三百多人组成水利大军，奋战四个月，挖修了共长三百里的干支渠道。同时在全社范围内进行了平整土地，把分散的田地连成大片。这样，四通八达的渠道，像血管一样遍布在近三千亩农田上，日夜把水输送到每一丘田；当积水过多时，渠道又把田里的积水排入河流，一年四季做到排灌畅通。
    东棚公社实现电力灌溉化以后，今年春花作物和早稻增产两成以上，连作稻面积也扩大很多。同时由于排灌代替了人力、牛力车水，全社比1958年节省了近二十万个工。公社把去年用于车水的一千四百多个劳力，分别加强了农业、工业、副业等方面的生产，因而使今年抢收抢种提前完成，速度在全县占第一。
    由于实行电力灌溉，还大大减轻水费负担，降低农业成本。今年和去年比较，灌溉费用可节省七万多元。
