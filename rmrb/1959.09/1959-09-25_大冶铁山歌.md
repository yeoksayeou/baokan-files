Song of Daye Iron Mine
Li Yang

White clouds often float in the blue sky, surrounded by verdant mountains.
You contain the supreme treasure of the world;
You contain abundance and infinity.
In those remote and ignorant ancient times, you harbored absurd myths:
It is said that a lame beggar came here to forge his iron crutch.
He forged that magical crutch,
He attained enlightenment and became an immortal,
The crutch transformed into a giant dragon, carrying him to heaven—
The place of enlightenment is this Enlightenment Bay.
This seemingly ridiculous legend,
Is so like the "flying carpet" in Western mythology—
Humanity's ancestors wanted to conquer nature long ago,
How romantic are these fantasies!

Generation after generation, you also harbored:
The miners' many hardships and sufferings.
The gurgling spring water flowing down the mountain,
Seems like their blood and tears have not yet dried.
They crawl in the mine all year round,
Extracting the supreme treasure of the world for the oppressors;
The oppressors refine the ore into pig iron,
And then forge it into shackles and butcher knives.
They crawl in the mine all year round,
Extracting the supreme treasure of the world for the exploiters;
The exploiters suck their blood and sweat,
And become wealthy without labor.
They created wealth for others,
But they themselves suffered whips and hunger;
The greatest wage for a lifetime of labor,
Is endless hatred and a thin wooden coffin.

When the Japanese devils invaded our sacred land,
You again harbored national hatred:
How much blood and tears flowed under the whip;
How many lives were buried alive in the mine pits!
Seven days' wages for one pound of salt,
Sounds like a fantastic tale.
Who says life is as bland as water?
The bitterness of life is saltier than saltwater!

Deeply buried underground hatred,
Sometimes erupts into a raging volcano:
Breaking the heavy yokes and shackles,
Illuminating the dark human hell.
Sometimes, a pair of huge, rough, black hands,
Strangles the devil's throat in the dead of night;
Sometimes, hundreds of flying carrying poles,
Scare the enemies to their very bones.
Hundreds of red flags are the torches of liberation,
In 1949, they illuminated Iron Mountain;
Illuminated the hungry and cold people;
And also burned away all hatred and suffering.

The oppressed people raised their eyebrows and breathed freely,
Waves of laughter surged from the depths of the pits;
Even the land and ore were unwilling to remain silent,
Rolling and reviving beneath the drilling machine.
In the old days, tigers haunted this place,
Now the human tigers no longer run rampant.
Nature has also changed its appearance along with society:
The flowers are redder than before, the grass is greener than before.
The dark, low thatched cottages have been torn down,
And replaced with red brick and tile workshops;
The mine pits have been closed, and open-pit mining is used,
People and ore are breathing in the sunlight.
Tall buildings are not anyone's villas,
But nurseries, hospitals, bookstores, and theaters.
The architecture of the ore dressing plant is towering and magnificent,
Surpassing the palaces of feudal lords.
Electric locomotives soar up and down,
Truly like the giant dragon transformed from Iron Crutch;
Electric shovels excavate ore day and night,
More capable than the hands of immortals.
Girls drive locomotives and air compressors,
Miners discuss poetic style on the construction site.
Joyful labor, joyful singing,
Flying like the morning glow, surging like the Yangtze River.
Laboring machines, laboring people,
Welcome the great leader Mao Zedong.
Joy has changed the color of the sun, moon, mountains, and rivers:
The sky is bluer than before, the sun is redder than before.
His footsteps do not step on the front line of national defense,
But step on this mountain city in the mining area;
Even the ore and sand are well aware:
What we want is peace, not war.

"Nature" is the most kind and broad-minded mother,
She best understands the feelings of her human children.
She uses red flowers to adorn the dilapidated bunkers;
And covers the trenches with green grass.
You contain the history of the nation and the class,
The people's struggle, life, and labor.
You contain more than just earthly treasures,
You contain infinity and boundlessness.
Pure white clouds drift in the sky,
Surrounded by verdant and green peaks.
Who can write this infinitely rich picture?
Could it be the Northern School of Li Family of ancient times!

    大冶铁山歌
    力扬蓝天上时常飘浮着白云，四周环绕着翠绿的群山。你蕴藏着的是人间的至宝；你蕴藏着的是丰富和无限。在那远古蒙昧的年代里，你蕴藏着无稽的神话：说有一个跛足的乞丐，来这里锻造他底铁拐杖。他锻成了那神异的拐杖，他就得了道，成了仙家，拐杖化为巨龙驮着他升天——得道的地方就是这得道湾。这个听来如此荒唐的传说，多么像西方神话中的“飞毯”——人类底祖先早就要征服自然，这些幻想是多么的浪漫！一代又一代，你也蕴藏过：矿工们多少的酸辛和苦难。那山下流淌着的淙淙泉水，好像是他们底血泪未干。他们终年匍匐在矿洞里，替压迫者开采着人间的至宝；压迫者把矿石炼成了生铁，又把它打成了镣链和屠刀。他们终年匍匐在矿洞里，替剥削者开采着人间的至宝；剥削者吸尽了他们底血汗，就成为不劳而食的富豪。他们给别人创造了富贵，自己却遭受着鞭挞和饥寒；劳动了一生的最大工资，是无尽的仇恨和薄薄的木棺。当日寇把神圣的国土侵犯，你又蕴藏着民族的仇恨：多少血泪在皮鞭下流淌；多少生命在矿坑里活埋！七天的工资是食盐一斤，听起来真像是天下奇谈。谁说日子过得水一样的淡？生活的苦味比盐水还要咸！深深地埋藏在地下的仇恨，有时会爆发成熊熊的火山：把沉重的枷锁、镣铐烧断，把黑暗的人间地狱照亮。有时，一双巨大粗黑的手，在深夜里掐断魔鬼的喉管；有时，千百根横飞的扁担，打得敌人们个个心惊胆怕。千百面红旗是解放的火炬，一九四九年照亮了铁山；照亮了饥寒交迫的人们；也烧毁了一切的仇恨和苦难。被压迫的人们扬眉吐气，深坑里奔流出浪涛般的笑声；连土地和矿石都不甘沉默，在钻探机下面翻滚，苏生。在旧时代里，猛虎在这里出没，如今人中的猛虎也不再横行。自然跟着社会也变了个样：花比往日的红，草比往日的青。拆去了阴暗、低矮的茅屋，改建成红砖红瓦的工房；停闭了矿坑，露天开采，人和矿石都吸呼着阳光。高楼大厦不是谁的别墅，是托儿所、医院、书店和剧场。选矿厂的建筑崔巍、雄壮，赛过了封建王侯的殿堂。电汽机车上下腾云驾雾，真像是铁拐杖化成的巨龙；电铲机日夜挖掘着矿石，比仙人的双手还要神通。姑娘们驾驶着机车、压风机，矿工们在工地上谈论着诗风。欢畅的劳动，欢畅的歌唱，朝霞般飞扬，长江般汹涌。劳动着的机械，劳动着的人，欢迎着伟大的领袖毛泽东。欢乐使日月山川都变了颜色：天比往日青，太阳比往日红。他底足步不踏上国防的前线，却踏上这个矿区里的山城；连矿石和沙土都十分了解：我们要的是和平，不是战争。“自然”是最慈爱、博大的母亲，她最理解人类儿女的心情。她用红花去点缀残破的碉堡；把战壕也铺上了绿草如茵。你蕴藏着民族和阶级的历史、人民底斗争、生活和劳动。你蕴藏着的不止人间的财宝，你蕴藏着的是无限和无穷。天上飘流着纯洁的白云，四围是苍翠碧绿的群峰。谁能写此无限丰富的图画？难道是古代的李家北宗！
    一九五九年八月二十三日，
            于武钢工地
