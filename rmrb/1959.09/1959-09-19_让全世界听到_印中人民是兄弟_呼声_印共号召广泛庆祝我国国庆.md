    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 17th -- The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India today issued a statement to the Indian press, calling on the entire party and all patriotic and peace-loving people in India to hold activities celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in order to promote Sino-Indian friendship.
    The statement first stated that the establishment of the People's Republic of China is a major event that has decisively shifted the world's balance of power in favor of peace, national independence, and socialism. It has greatly encouraged the people and countries of Asia. The remarkable progress China has made in social and economic fields during this short period has moved and inspired millions of people. In these ten years, the friendship between our two countries has greatly strengthened, which has brought great benefits to both India and China, and has popularized the influence of Panchsheel throughout the world.
    The statement pointed out that Sino-Indian friendship is the cornerstone of Asian unity, the strongest guarantee of the freedom of newly independent Asian countries, and the best guarantee against the imperialist plots to undermine peace and destroy the freedom of Asian countries.
    The statement then said that in the past few months, regrettable border incidents have cast a shadow over this precious friendship. The reactionary forces in India are doing everything possible to further, and even completely, destroy this friendship. Western imperialist groups are trying to exploit this situation to achieve their own goals.
    The statement concluded by saying that the Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India calls on all party committees, units, and all party members to immediately carry out preparations to warmly celebrate "October 1st." On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we must do our best to conduct propaganda and mobilization among all people in India who strive to further strengthen and promote Sino-Indian friendship. All patriots and peace-loving people must, through gatherings, parades, exhibitions, discussions, and other forms, let the world hear the cry of "Indian and Chinese people are brothers."

    让全世界听到“印中人民是兄弟”呼声
    印共号召广泛庆祝我国国庆
    新华社新德里17日电　印度共产党全国委员会书记处今天向印度报界发表声明，号召全党和印度所有爱国、和平人士举行庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的活动，以促进印中友谊。
    声明首先说，中华人民共和国的建立是使世界力量对比决定性地转向有利于和平、有利于民族独立和社会主义的一件大事。它对亚洲人民和国家起了莫大的鼓舞作用。中国在这短短期间在社会和经济方面所取得的惊人进展感动和启发了千百万人民。在这十年内，我们两国的友谊大大增强了，从而对印、中两国带来极大的好处，并且使潘查希拉的影响普及全世界。
    声明指出，印中友谊是亚洲团结的基石，是新近独立的亚洲国家的自由的最坚固的保证，是使帝国主义破坏和平、摧残亚洲国家的自由的阴谋诡计不能得逞的最好保障。
    声明接着说，在过去几个月中，令人遗憾的边界事件给这种珍贵的友谊蒙上了一层阴影。印度的反动派正在千方百计地进一步、甚至完全破坏这种友谊。西方帝国主义集团试图利用这种局面来达到它们自己的目的。
    声明最后说，印度共产党全国委员会书记处号召全党各委员会、各单位和全体党员立即进行准备工作，来热烈庆祝“十·一”。在中华人民共和国成立十周年之际，必须竭尽全力对印度所有力求进一步加强和促进印中友谊的人们进行宣传鼓动。所有爱国者和爱好和平的人士必须通过集会、游行、展览会、讨论会等等形式，让全世界听到“印中人民是兄弟”的呼声。
