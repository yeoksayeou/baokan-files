Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The National Labor Reform of Criminals Work Exhibition, showcasing the tremendous achievements in our country's labor reform of criminals, is now ready and scheduled to officially open in Beijing on October 2nd.

This exhibition is sponsored by the Ministry of Public Security. During the preparation period, a preview of the exhibition was held, attracting 240,000 visitors. Among the visitors were prominent figures from all walks of life, as well as cadres, workers, farmers, soldiers, and students. They unanimously praised the great achievements of the labor reform work during their visits.

Through Concrete Examples, the Achievements of Labor Reform Work are Vividly Introduced

The exhibition is located in Beijing's Ditan Park. The exhibition is divided into three parts. The first part uses many physical objects and typical examples to vividly introduce the achievements of labor reform work. The second and third parts introduce the production achievements of labor reform inmates.

The first part of the exhibition tells people that the policy of labor reform of criminals is: combining punishment with leniency, and combining labor reform with ideological education. At the exhibition, people saw from charts the labor reform organs' organization of criminals to participate in labor production and the labor reform organs' thorough political and ideological education for criminals, all based on this policy. In the early days of liberation, labor reform organs focused on carrying out repentance and law-abiding education for prisoners, making them bow their heads, admit their guilt, and honestly confess their crimes. During the socialist three major transformations movement, labor reform organs carried out socialist prospect education for criminals. In this education, in addition to organizing prisoners to study documents, they also organized prisoners to visit various socialist construction projects. During the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, labor reform organs organized prisoners to study Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. During the Great Leap Forward, labor reform organs conducted education for prisoners on "double leaps in ideological transformation and labor production." The exhibition tells people that through labor reform and a series of educations, the vast majority of criminals have been transformed to varying degrees, and a considerable number of criminals have indeed turned over a new leaf and started a new life.

The exhibition also displayed many typical examples, such as the local tyrant Ye Huasheng, who claimed to have "four fears" in the early stage of labor reform: fear of labor, fear of seeing the sun, fear of eating coarse grains, and fear of getting up early. After several years of labor reform and ideological education, he has been able to participate in labor honestly. In the past, he could only lift thirty catties of things with other prisoners, but now he can carry one hundred and thirty catties alone. He has developed a habit of labor and actively learns production techniques. Zhao Jinming, a famous "black money" thief in Tianjin, had more than 20 years of theft history. After labor reform, he has now become a fifth-grade kiln worker.

While organizing criminals to participate in labor and conducting ideological education, labor reform organs also organize prisoners to learn techniques. A chart in the exhibition shows that according to statistics from nine labor reform units, 61.3% of the prisoners who originally did not understand technology have now learned general techniques, and 12.4% of the prisoners who were originally technicians have now been promoted to the level of technicians. Many of the prisoners undergoing labor reform have become agricultural, water conservancy, animal husbandry, forestry, fishery, construction, medical, and other technical personnel. The exhibition displayed a set of comic strips about Wang Lun, a special agent who did not understand technology, learning architectural design techniques. Wang Lun was imprisoned for labor reform in 1949 and went to the labor reform construction engineering team to study design techniques in 1952. He said with infinite gratitude: This is something I never dreamed of. Under the supervision and education of government cadres, he studied technology diligently and quickly learned the design techniques for general office buildings and dormitories.

Labor reform organs also organize criminals to study culture. In the glass cabinets of the exhibition are cultural textbooks and blocks printed by labor reform organs in various places for prisoners to study, as well as prisoners' homework books. A chart in the exhibition shows that according to statistics from twenty-five labor reform units, more than 68% of the prisoners who were originally illiterate have now shaken off the label of illiteracy. A letter from a prisoner named Jiang Yikang to the labor reform organ stated: I am a shameful thief who did not learn culture since I was a child and wandered around public places in the city to steal. I was arrested in 1954, and after the government's leniency, I was sentenced and underwent labor reform. Within three years, I learned more than 2,000 characters and can now read newspapers and write letters. He said gratefully in his letter: The people's kindness is truly endless.

Many Criminals Have Begun to Become Useful People for the Socialist Construction of the Motherland

The second and third parts of the exhibition introduced the situation of labor reform production to the audience. In these two parts of the exhibits, people saw that in the process of labor reform, prisoners transformed their thinking and also produced many products for society. At the exhibition, people can see agricultural products, light industrial products, as well as machinery, electrical machinery, chemical, mining and other products produced by prisoners. These indicate that under the call of the labor reform policy, many prisoners have begun to become useful people for the socialist construction of the motherland.

An overseas Chinese who had just returned from abroad expressed his feelings in the guestbook after visiting the exhibition. He wrote: I have just returned to the motherland from a capitalist country. After visiting the exhibition today, I am even more proud of the motherland. Because the cause of transforming bad people into good people carried out in our motherland is something that no capitalist country can do. I want to shout: Long live the great motherland!

    劳动改造罪犯工作展览会筹备就绪
    将于十月二日起在北京正式开幕
    新华社23日讯　显示我国劳动改造罪犯工作获得巨大成绩的全国劳动改造罪犯工作展览会，已经筹备就绪，决定于10月2日在北京正式开幕。
    这个展览会是由公安部举办的。在筹备期间，展览会举行了预展，观众已达二十四万人。参观的人中，有社会各界知名人士，还有机关干部、工人、农民、军人和学生等。他们在参观中一致赞扬劳动改造工作的伟大成绩。
    通过具体事例生动地介绍了劳动改造工作的成绩
    展览会设在北京地坛公园。展览会分三个部分，第一部分是以许多实物、典型事例，具体生动地介绍劳动改造工作的成绩，第二和第三部分是介绍劳改犯人的生产成绩。
    展览会的第一部分告诉人们，劳动改造罪犯的方针是：惩办和宽大相结合、劳动改造和思想教育相结合。在展览会上，人们从图表中看到了劳改机关根据这个方针组织罪犯参加劳动生产和劳改机关对罪犯充分地进行政治思想教育的情况。在解放初期，劳改机关着重地对犯人进行认罪守法教育，使罪犯低头认罪，老实交代罪行。在社会主义三大改造运动中，劳改机关向罪犯进行社会主义前途教育。在这一教育中，除组织犯人学习文件外，还组织犯人参观各项社会主义建设。在整风运动和反右派斗争中，劳改机关组织犯人学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的讲话。在大跃进中，劳改机关对罪犯进行了“改造思想、劳动生产双跃进”的教育。展览会告诉人们，通过劳动改造和一系列的教育，使绝大多数犯人得到不同程度的改造，有相当一批犯人确实已经改恶从善，重新做人。
    展览会还展出了很多典型事例，如恶霸地主叶华生，在劳动改造初期，自称有“四怕”：怕劳动、怕见太阳、怕吃粗粮、怕起床早。经过几年的劳动改造和思想教育以后，他已经能够老老实实地参加劳动。过去他只能和其他犯人合抬三十斤重的东西，现在能单挑一百三十斤，他已养成了劳动习惯，积极学习生产技术。天津市有名的“黑钱”大盗赵金铭，有了二十多年的盗窃历史，经过劳动改造，现在已成为五级烧窑技工。
    劳改机关在组织罪犯参加劳动和对罪犯进行思想教育的同时，还组织犯人学习技术。展览会上的一幅图表中标明：根据九个劳改单位的统计，原来不懂技术的现已学会一般技术的犯人占61.3％，原来是技工的现在已提高到技术员水平的犯人占12.4％。正在劳改的犯人中有许多已成为农业、水利、畜牧、林业、渔业、建筑业、医务等各种技术人员。展览会展出了一个不懂技术的特务分子王仑学习建筑设计技术的一套连环画。王仑1949年入狱劳改，1952年到劳改建筑工程队学习设计技术。他无限感激地说：这是我做梦也没有想到的事情。他在政府干部的督促和教育下，钻研技术，很快地学会了一般办公楼和宿舍的设计技术。
    劳动改造机关还组织罪犯学习文化。在展览会的玻璃柜里展出了各地劳改机关印制的供犯人学习的文化课本、字块，还有犯人的作业本等。展览会一幅图表上标明：根据二十五个劳改单位的统计，原来是文盲的犯人，现在已有68％以上摘掉了文盲帽子。展览会展出的一个名叫江彝康的犯人给劳改机关的信中说：我是一个可耻的盗窃犯，从小没有学习文化，成天流浪在城市的公共场所行窃，1954年被捕，经政府宽大判刑，劳动改造，三年内学会了二千多字，已能读报和写信。他在信中感激地说：人民的恩情真是说也说不完。
    许多犯人开始成为祖国社会主义建设有用的人
    展览会的第二、第三部分向观众介绍了劳改生产的情况。人们在这两部分展品中，看到了犯人在劳动改造过程中，改造了思想，也为社会生产了许多产品。在展览会上人们可以看到犯人生产的农产品、轻工业产品以及机械、电机、化工、矿业等产品。这一些表明了许多犯人在劳改政策的感召下，已开始成为祖国社会主义建设中有用的人。
    一位刚从国外回来的华侨参观后在留言簿上发表了他的感想。他写道：我刚从一个资本主义国家回到祖国，今天参观了展览会后，使我更加为祖国骄傲。因为，在我们的祖国所进行的把坏人改造成为好人的事业是任何资本主义国家所办不到的。我要高呼：伟大的祖国万岁！（附图片）
