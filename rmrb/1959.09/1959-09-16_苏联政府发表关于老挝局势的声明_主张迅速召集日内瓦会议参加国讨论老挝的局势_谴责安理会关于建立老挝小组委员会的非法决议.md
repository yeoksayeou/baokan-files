Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th. TASS Moscow, September 15th: Statement by the Soviet Government regarding the situation in Laos. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On September 7, 1959, representatives of Western countries took illegal actions in the Security Council, attempting to use the guise of the United Nations to cover up their interference in Laotian affairs. This action manifested itself in the fact that ten members of the Security Council, disregarding the United Nations Charter and violating the Geneva Agreements on Laos, voted in favor of establishing a subcommittee composed of Argentina, Italy, Japan, and Tunisia, tasking this subcommittee with studying the statements made in the Security Council regarding Laos, accepting new statements and documents, conducting investigations it deems necessary, and submitting a report to the Security Council as quickly as possible.

The Soviet government cannot ignore this action, because it contains serious consequences, and its purpose is obviously to create obstacles to hinder the smooth implementation of the measures currently being taken to ease international tensions.

The Security Council's Discussion and Decision Violate the UN Charter

The discussion in the Security Council of the question of establishing a subcommittee and the vote by ten members of the Security Council in favor of the aforementioned proposal clearly violate the United Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the Security Council. Moreover, submitting this issue to the Security Council for discussion is itself illegal.

As everyone knows, on September 4, 1959, the Lao Foreign Minister sent a telegram to the UN Secretary-General, falsely claiming that forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had taken action against Lao troops.

Despite the fact that no member of the Security Council requested that this issue be submitted to the Security Council for discussion, the Italian representative, serving as president of the Security Council in September, with the active assistance of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, convened a meeting of the Security Council and submitted the resolution proposed by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the establishment of a subcommittee to the Security Council for discussion.

It is worth noting that, in order to achieve their ulterior motives, the representatives of Western countries, in violation of the United Nations Charter and practice, attempted to assert that the recommendations in the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France were procedural in nature and that the passage of such recommendations did not require the unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council.

However, this position of the Western countries is untenable. If one examines the United Nations Charter, it is not difficult to be convinced of this. According to the United Nations Charter, all issues submitted to the Security Council for discussion are divided into two categories: substantive issues and procedural issues. Resolutions on the first category of issues must be passed by at least seven members of the Security Council, including the affirmative votes of all permanent members of the Security Council. Resolutions on the second category of issues require the affirmative votes of at least seven members of the Security Council. If a dispute arises as to which category an issue belongs, then such a dispute shall be resolved by a vote, and a decision to classify the issue as procedural must be approved by all permanent members of the Security Council. This voting system of the Security Council is expressly stipulated in the United Nations Charter and in the declaration published on June 7, 1945, in the name of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and China, and adopted by all the founding members of the United Nations.

The governments of the United States, Britain, and France, as initiators of the draft resolution to establish a subcommittee, as well as the governments of Italy, Japan, Argentina, Panama, Canada, and Tunisia, which voted in favor of this resolution, disregarded both the United Nations Charter and the aforementioned declaration, and declared that the resolution had been passed. However, one of the permanent members of the Security Council opposed the proposal.

In the past, in the actual work of the Security Council, there have also been cases where it discussed draft resolutions submitted to it regarding the establishment of investigative bodies. In all these instances, the voting on these drafts followed the principle of unanimous agreement of all permanent members of the Security Council.

For example, in 1946, during the discussion of the Greek question in the Security Council, a proposal was made to establish a committee and entrust it with investigating the facts concerning incidents on the northern border of Greece. The Security Council did not pass this proposal because a permanent member of the Council voted against it. Is this example not very similar to the Laotian question?

Similar situations that have occurred in the Security Council can also be cited, for example, situations that occurred during the study of the Indonesian question (1947), the Czechoslovak question (1948), the Chinese question (1950), and other questions.

Whether the provisions of the Charter and the Declaration, or the actual work of the Security Council, show that the Western countries have clearly embarked on the path of undermining the United Nations Charter by including the Laotian question on the agenda of the Security Council and voting in favor of the resolution to establish a subcommittee, which contains serious consequences for peace and security. By taking this step, Western countries have further undermined the foundations upon which the United Nations Organization was built.

Due to the extremely crude violation of the United Nations Charter in studying this issue, it goes without saying that the aforementioned resolution cannot be considered to have been passed by the Security Council.

This Approach by Western Countries Aims to Poison the International Atmosphere

This behavior of Western countries in the Security Council reflects the attempt by certain groups in these countries to poison the international atmosphere at a time when signs of easing international tensions are clearly emerging, and all mankind hopes to end the "Cold War" and associates this hope with the upcoming mutual visits between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States. The recent provocative act of handing over the Laotian entanglement to the Security Council for discussion proves that certain influential political figures in the West clearly dislike the tendency of improving Soviet-American relations that has formed and is increasingly having a beneficial impact on the international climate. They fear a further warming of the international climate and are therefore taking every possible means to hinder the desire of all peoples to approach each other and to eliminate the "cold" and "hot" wars in international relations. There is no other reason to explain the undeniable fact that the Laotian "accusation" was forcibly brought to the Security Council for discussion, and the representatives of Western countries began to directly disregard the United Nations Charter and violate the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The Geneva Agreements on Laos stipulate that all measures must be taken to restore and maintain peace in the country and to ensure its peaceful and democratic development. The Geneva Agreements stipulate that Laos shall not at any time participate in the execution of an aggressive policy, nor shall it allow its territory to be used for such policy. According to these agreements, foreign military personnel are prohibited from entering Laos, and the import of weapons, ammunition, and military materials is prohibited, except for a certain quantity and type of armaments specifically stipulated as necessary for Lao national defense, and the transfer of these armaments to Laos shall be carried out under the supervision of the Lao International Commission. The Geneva Agreements also stipulate that the Lao government shall allow all participants of the former Pathet Lao movement to participate in the common national life without discrimination and guarantee that they enjoy equal and free civil rights.

The Geneva Agreements Have Suffered a Serious Blow

The agreement on the Lao International Supervisory and Control Commission, composed of representatives from India, Poland, and Canada, is an integral part of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, making this "concern" to send any other observers to Laos unnecessary, unless this "concern" is not pursuing provocative purposes.

If Western countries truly hope to resolve the Laotian situation that has intensified recently, then why not authorize the Lao International Commission, which is operating in accordance with the Geneva Agreements signed by these Western countries, to quickly resume its work and cooperate with the Lao government in formulating measures to quickly normalize the situation in the country?

However, this obviously most effective way to eliminate the source of Laotian tension seems to be the least in line with the objectives of the aforementioned Western political groups, and thus the Laotian slander was brought to an international forum such as the United Nations Security Council, and the resolution to establish a subcommittee on Laos was illegally passed. This subcommittee is said to have sent "observers" to Laos. These actions mean undermining the agreement on the Lao International Supervisory and Control Commission, which is not only a serious blow to the Geneva Agreements on Laos, but also a serious blow to the entire set of Geneva Agreements on Indochina. The Soviet government cannot fail to point out that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, as the initiators of the aforementioned resolution, bear full responsibility for this; such behavior may have far-reaching consequences for peace and security in Indochina. In view of this situation, one cannot ignore the belligerent remarks of American generals and leaders of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, who are clamoring to prepare to immediately use the armed forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states, primarily the armed forces of the United States, to conduct extensive military intervention in Laos.

Western Countries Want to Shift Responsibility for the Situation to the Sananikone Government

The actions of Western countries undoubtedly show that they want to use this approach to shift the responsibility for the current situation in Laos to the Sananikone government, while clamoring around the provocative slander that forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have invaded Laos, in order to deceive world public opinion.

It cannot be denied that the United States State Department is playing an unsavory role in this regard, as it has adopted its usual trick - declaring that the recent events in Laos are the result of "foreign communist interference." However, this approach is commonplace. Whenever it wants to cover up the United States' reckless interference in the internal affairs of other countries, the State Department resorts to this trick. As for Laos, this interference is being carried out by sending American military advisors and instructors to the country, as well as importing weapons and various military supplies.

However, no matter what slanders the Sananikone government and its protectors fabricate, they cannot conceal the fact that this government has refused to fulfill the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the Vientiane Agreements, used force against soldiers of the former Pathet Lao combat forces who should have been incorporated into the Lao regular army, arrested Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, implemented terror and persecution against personnel of the former Pathet Lao side, and attempted to stifle democratic forces that advocate Laos' implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality and advocate the participation of participants in the national liberation struggle in Lao social life. The fault for the current state of division in Laos and the armed activities taken by residents dissatisfied with the actions of the Sananikone government lies entirely with the Sananikone government and those who prompted it to violate the Geneva Agreements. Does not the fact that Lao patriotic forces are only demanding that the Sananikone government resume compliance with and further implementation of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements also confirm this point?

The Soviet government believes that the tensions that have arisen in Laos can and should only be resolved on the basis and within the scope of the Geneva Agreements, because the Geneva Agreements are the foundation of peace and security in Indochina. The Soviet government deeply regrets that Western countries are willing to use the Security Council to undermine these agreements and to incite actions aimed at tearing them up.

The Soviet government believes that maintaining the Geneva Agreements on Indochina is its inescapable obligation, because abolishing these agreements would mean eliminating the only legal basis for maintaining peace in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. In this regard, the Soviet government fully understands and shares the unease and concern shown by the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of India, and other countries concerned with maintaining and consolidating peace and security regarding the situation formed in Laos.

In order to resolve the Laotian issue and normalize the situation in the region, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to rapidly convene a meeting of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to discuss the situation that has formed in Laos. The Soviet government believes that the Lao International Supervisory and Control Commission should report to the aforementioned conference on the results of its work and its proposed recommendations for normalizing the situation in Laos.

The Soviet government hopes that this proposal of the Soviet government will receive the support of the governments of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference on Indochina.

### 苏联政府发表关于老挝局势的声明  主张迅速召集日内瓦会议参加国讨论老挝的局势  谴责安理会关于建立老挝小组委员会的非法决议

    苏联政府发表关于老挝局势的声明
    主张迅速召集日内瓦会议参加国讨论老挝的局势
    谴责安理会关于建立老挝小组委员会的非法决议
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联政府关于老挝局势的声明。声明全文如下：
    1959年9月7日，西方国家的代表在安全理事会中采取了非法的行动，想用联合国的幌子来掩饰他们对老挝事务的干涉。这种行动表现在，安理会的十个理事国不顾联合国宪章，并且违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议，投票赞成建立一个由阿根廷、意大利、日本和突尼斯组成的小组委员会，责成这个小组委员会来研究在安理会中发表的有关老挝的声明，接受新的声明和文件，进行它认为必要的调查，并且尽速地向安理会提出报告。
    苏联政府不能无视这种行动，因为这种行动包藏着严重的后果，其目的显然是想制造障碍，来阻挠目前在缓和国际紧张局势方面所采取的措施的顺利执行。
    安理会的讨论和决定违反联合国宪章
    讨论在安理会中成立小组委员会的问题和安理会十个理事国投票赞成上述提案，显然违反了联合国宪章和安理会的议事规程。而且，把这个问题提交安理会讨论这件事本身就是非法的。
    大家知道，1959年9月4日老挝外交大臣曾致电联合国秘书长，电报中无中生有地硬说，越南民主共和国部队对老挝驻军采取了行动。
    尽管没有一个安理会理事国请求把这个问题提交安理会讨论，然而在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的积极帮助下，担任安理会9月份主席的意大利代表竟召开了安理会会议，并且把美、英、法三国代表提出的关于成立小组委员会的决议案提交安理会讨论。
    值得注意的是，西方国家代表为了要实现自己的见不得人的目的，竟违背联合国宪章和惯例而企图证实，仿佛美、英、法三国提案中的建议是程序性的，通过这种建议并不需要安理会常任理事国的一致。
    但是，西方国家的这种立场是站不住脚的。如果翻一翻联合国宪章，就不难确信这一点。根据联合国宪章，提交安理会讨论的所有问题分为两类：实质问题和程序问题。对第一类问题通过决议，至少必须有七个安理会理事国，包括安理会所有常任理事国投赞成票。关于第二类问题的决议，需要安理会至少七个任何理事国投票赞成。如果对某一问题属于哪一类产生了争执，那么这种争执应通过表决来解决，而要作出关于把这个问题列为程序问题的决定，必须经过安理会所有常任理事国的同意。安理会的这种表决制度是联合国宪章和1945年6月7日以苏联、美国、英国、中国的名义发表并为联合国全体创始国所通过的宣言中明文规定的。
    作为成立小组委员会决议草案倡议人的美国、英国和法国政府，以及投票赞成这一决议的意大利、日本、阿根廷、巴拿马、加拿大和突尼斯政府既不考虑联合国宪章，也不考虑上述宣言，却宣布这一决议已经通过了，但是，安理会常任理事国之一是反对这一提案的。
    过去在安理会的实际工作中，也有过这样的情况：它讨论过提交给它的关于成立调查机构的这种决议草案。在所有这些场合，表决这些草案时都遵循了安理会全体常任理事国一致同意的原则。
    例如，1946年安理会在讨论希腊问题时曾有人提议成立一个委员会，并委托这个委员会调查有关希腊北部边境事件的事实。安理会没有通过这个提案，因为理事会的一个常任理事国投票反对。难道这个例子和老挝问题不是十分相似吗？
    还可以举出一些安理会所发生过的类似的情况，例如，在研究印度尼西亚问题（1947年）、捷克斯洛伐克问题（1948年）、中国问题（1950年）及其他问题时所发生过的情况。
    无论是宪章和宣言的条文，还是安理会的实际工作都表明，西方国家把老挝问题列入安理会的议程并投票赞成关于建立小组委员会的决议，显然已经走上了破坏联合国宪章的道路，这对和平和安全包藏着严重的后果。西方国家采取这种步骤进一步破坏了联合国组织赖以建立的基础。
    由于在研究这个问题时极粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章，不言而喻，上述决议案不能认为是由安理会所通过的。
    西方国家这种做法旨在毒化国际气氛
    西方国家在安理会上采取的这种行为反映了这些国家的某些集团企图在这样一个时候来毒化国际气氛，这个时候就是：国际紧张局势缓和的征兆已明显显示出来了，全人类都希望结束“冷战”，并把这种希望同苏联和美国两国政府首脑之间即将进行的互相访问联系在一起。最近把老挝的纠葛交给安理会讨论这种挑衅性的作法证明，西方某些有影响的政界人士显然不喜欢目前已形成的、并日益对国际气候有良好影响的改善苏美关系的倾向。他们担心国际气候进一步转暖，因而正在采取一切可能采取的手段，来阻挠各国人民力求相互接近、力求消除国际关系中的“冷”战和“热”战的愿望。没有其它原因可以解释下面这一无可争论的事实：老挝的“控告”是强行提到安理会来讨论的，西方国家的代表开始直接无视联合国宪章，破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    关于老挝的日内瓦协议规定，要采取一切措施来恢复和保持这个国家的和平，来保证它的和平和民主的发展。日内瓦协议规定老挝任何时候不得参与执行侵略性政策，不得允许利用老挝领土为这种政策服务。根据这些协议，禁止外国军事人员进入老挝，禁止运进武器、军火和军事物资，除了老挝国防所需要的一定数量的种类有特殊规定的军备以外，而且向老挝输送这些军备应在老挝国际委员会的监督下进行。日内瓦协议还规定老挝政府应毫无歧视地使前寮国运动的所有参加者参加全国共同生活，并保证他们平等地和自由地享有公民权。
    日内瓦协议遭到了严重的打击
    关于由印度、波兰、加拿大的代表组成老挝国际监察和监督委员会的协议是关于老挝的日内瓦协议的不可分割的一部分，它使企图向老挝派遣任何其他观察员的这种“关怀”成为不必要，除非这种“关怀”不是追求挑衅性目的。
    如果西方国家真正希望解决最近期间加剧的老挝局势，那么为什么不授权根据有这些西方国家参与签定的日内瓦协议进行活动的老挝国际委员会迅速恢复工作并同老挝政府合作制订使这个国家局势迅速正常化的措施呢？
    但是，这一显然最有效的消除老挝紧张局势策源地的途径，看来最不符合上述西方政治集团的目的，于是把老挝的诬赖搬到了像联合国安全理事会这样的国际讲坛上，并非法地通过了成立关于老挝的小组委员会的决议，据说这个小组委员会已经往老挝派出“观察员”。这些行动意味着破坏关于老挝国际监察和监督委员会的协议，不仅是对关于老挝的日内瓦协议的严重打击，而且是对关于印度支那问题的整套日内瓦协议的严重打击。苏联政府不能不指出：作为上述决议的发起人的美国、英国和法国政府应对此负完全的责任；这种行为可能对印度支那的和平和安全造成深远的后果。鉴于这种情况，不能无视美国将军们和东南亚条约组织领导人的好战言论，他们叫嚷准备立即使用东南亚条约组织成员国的武装部队，首先是美国的武装部队对老挝进行广泛的军事干涉。
    西方国家想为萨纳尼空政府推卸责任
    西方国家的行动无疑说明，它们想同时用这种做法来为萨纳尼空政府推卸对目前老挝局势应负的责任，围绕着硬说越南民主共和国部队侵入老挝的挑衅谰言进行叫嚣，以欺骗世界公众。
    不能不指出美国国务院在这方面所起的不光彩的作用，美国国务院采用了它的惯技——宣布老挝最近的事件是“外来的共产主义干涉”的结果。然而，这种作法是屡见不鲜的。每当要掩盖美国对其他国家内政的疯狂干涉的时候，国务院就采用这种伎俩。至于对老挝，这种干涉正在通过向这个国家派遣美国军事顾问和教官以及运入军火和各种军用物资等办法来进行着。
    但是，不管萨纳尼空政府及其保护人制造什么谰言，都不能掩饰这样一个事实，即这个政府拒绝履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和万象协议，采用武力对付应该编入老挝正规军的前寮国战斗部队的战士，逮捕了苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领袖，对前寮国方面的人员实行恐怖和迫害，企图窒息主张老挝执行和平和中立政策以及主张让民族解放斗争参加者参加老挝社会生活的民主力量。目前老挝之所以处于国家分裂状态和居民对萨纳尼空政府行动的不满采取了武装活动的形式，过错完全在于萨纳尼空政府和促使它违背日内瓦协议的那些人。老挝爱国力量只是要求萨纳尼空政府重新遵守和进一步实现日内瓦协议和万象协议，难道不也证实了这点吗？
    苏联政府相信，在老挝产生的紧张局势能够而且应当只在日内瓦协议的基础上和范围内求得解决，因为日内瓦协议是印度支那和平和安全的基础。苏联政府深感遗憾的是，西方国家竟不惜利用安理会来破坏这些协议，并鼓动旨在撕毁这些协议的行动。
    苏联政府认为，维护关于印度支那的日内瓦协议是自己义不容辞的义务，因为废除这些协议将意味着取消维持越南、老挝和柬埔寨和平的唯一法律基础。苏联政府在这方面完全理解和分担越南民主共和国、柬埔寨王国、中华人民共和国、印度共和国政府以及关心维护和巩固和平和安全的其他国家政府对老挝形成的局势所表现的不安和忧虑。
    为了解决老挝问题和使这个地区的局势正常化，苏联政府认为必须迅速召集参加1954年印度支那问题日内瓦会议的国家开会，来讨论在老挝所形成的局势。苏联政府认为，老挝国际监察和监督委员会应当向上述会议报告它的工作结果和它所提出的关于使老挝局势正常化的措施的建议。
    苏联政府希望，苏联政府这一建议将会得到关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议参加国政府的支持。
