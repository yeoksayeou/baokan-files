Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th. TASS Moscow, September 15th: Statement by the Soviet Government regarding the situation in Laos. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On September 7, 1959, representatives of Western countries took illegal actions in the Security Council, attempting to use the guise of the United Nations to cover up their interference in Laotian affairs. This action manifested itself in the fact that ten members of the Security Council, disregarding the United Nations Charter and violating the Geneva Agreements on Laos, voted in favor of establishing a subcommittee composed of Argentina, Italy, Japan, and Tunisia, tasking this subcommittee with studying the statements made in the Security Council regarding Laos, accepting new statements and documents, conducting investigations it deems necessary, and submitting a report to the Security Council as quickly as possible.

The Soviet government cannot ignore this action, because it contains serious consequences, and its purpose is obviously to create obstacles to hinder the smooth implementation of the measures currently being taken to ease international tensions.

The Security Council's Discussion and Decision Violate the UN Charter

The discussion in the Security Council of the question of establishing a subcommittee and the vote by ten members of the Security Council in favor of the aforementioned proposal clearly violate the United Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the Security Council. Moreover, submitting this issue to the Security Council for discussion is itself illegal.

As everyone knows, on September 4, 1959, the Lao Foreign Minister sent a telegram to the UN Secretary-General, falsely claiming that forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had taken action against Lao troops.

Despite the fact that no member of the Security Council requested that this issue be submitted to the Security Council for discussion, the Italian representative, serving as president of the Security Council in September, with the active assistance of UN Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld, convened a meeting of the Security Council and submitted the resolution proposed by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the establishment of a subcommittee to the Security Council for discussion.

It is worth noting that, in order to achieve their ulterior motives, the representatives of Western countries, in violation of the United Nations Charter and practice, attempted to assert that the recommendations in the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France were procedural in nature and that the passage of such recommendations did not require the unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council.

However, this position of the Western countries is untenable. If one examines the United Nations Charter, it is not difficult to be convinced of this. According to the United Nations Charter, all issues submitted to the Security Council for discussion are divided into two categories: substantive issues and procedural issues. Resolutions on the first category of issues must be passed by at least seven members of the Security Council, including the affirmative votes of all permanent members of the Security Council. Resolutions on the second category of issues require the affirmative votes of at least seven members of the Security Council. If a dispute arises as to which category an issue belongs, then such a dispute shall be resolved by a vote, and a decision to classify the issue as procedural must be approved by all permanent members of the Security Council. This voting system of the Security Council is expressly stipulated in the United Nations Charter and in the declaration published on June 7, 1945, in the name of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and China, and adopted by all the founding members of the United Nations.

The governments of the United States, Britain, and France, as initiators of the draft resolution to establish a subcommittee, as well as the governments of Italy, Japan, Argentina, Panama, Canada, and Tunisia, which voted in favor of this resolution, disregarded both the United Nations Charter and the aforementioned declaration, and declared that the resolution had been passed. However, one of the permanent members of the Security Council opposed the proposal.

In the past, in the actual work of the Security Council, there have also been cases where it discussed draft resolutions submitted to it regarding the establishment of investigative bodies. In all these instances, the voting on these drafts followed the principle of unanimous agreement of all permanent members of the Security Council.

For example, in 1946, during the discussion of the Greek question in the Security Council, a proposal was made to establish a committee and entrust it with investigating the facts concerning incidents on the northern border of Greece. The Security Council did not pass this proposal because a permanent member of the Council voted against it. Is this example not very similar to the Laotian question?

Similar situations that have occurred in the Security Council can also be cited, for example, situations that occurred during the study of the Indonesian question (1947), the Czechoslovak question (1948), the Chinese question (1950), and other questions.

Whether the provisions of the Charter and the Declaration, or the actual work of the Security Council, show that the Western countries have clearly embarked on the path of undermining the United Nations Charter by including the Laotian question on the agenda of the Security Council and voting in favor of the resolution to establish a subcommittee, which contains serious consequences for peace and security. By taking this step, Western countries have further undermined the foundations upon which the United Nations Organization was built.

Due to the extremely crude violation of the United Nations Charter in studying this issue, it goes without saying that the aforementioned resolution cannot be considered to have been passed by the Security Council.

This Approach by Western Countries Aims to Poison the International Atmosphere

This behavior of Western countries in the Security Council reflects the attempt by certain groups in these countries to poison the international atmosphere at a time when signs of easing international tensions are clearly emerging, and all mankind hopes to end the "Cold War" and associates this hope with the upcoming mutual visits between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States. The recent provocative act of handing over the Laotian entanglement to the Security Council for discussion proves that certain influential political figures in the West clearly dislike the tendency of improving Soviet-American relations that has formed and is increasingly having a beneficial impact on the international climate. They fear a further warming of the international climate and are therefore taking every possible means to hinder the desire of all peoples to approach each other and to eliminate the "cold" and "hot" wars in international relations. There is no other reason to explain the undeniable fact that the Laotian "accusation" was forcibly brought to the Security Council for discussion, and the representatives of Western countries began to directly disregard the United Nations Charter and violate the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The Geneva Agreements on Laos stipulate that all measures must be taken to restore and maintain peace in the country and to ensure its peaceful and democratic development. The Geneva Agreements stipulate that Laos shall not at any time participate in the execution of an aggressive policy, nor shall it allow its territory to be used for such policy. According to these agreements, foreign military personnel are prohibited from entering Laos, and the import of weapons, ammunition, and military materials is prohibited, except for a certain quantity and type of armaments specifically stipulated as necessary for Lao national defense, and the transfer of these armaments to Laos shall be carried out under the supervision of the Lao International Commission. The Geneva Agreements also stipulate that the Lao government shall allow all participants of the former Pathet Lao movement to participate in the common national life without discrimination and guarantee that they enjoy equal and free civil rights.

The Geneva Agreements Have Suffered a Serious Blow

The agreement on the Lao International Supervisory and Control Commission, composed of representatives from India, Poland, and Canada, is an integral part of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, making this "concern" to send any other observers to Laos unnecessary, unless this "concern" is not pursuing provocative purposes.

If Western countries truly hope to resolve the Laotian situation that has intensified recently, then why not authorize the Lao International Commission, which is operating in accordance with the Geneva Agreements signed by these Western countries, to quickly resume its work and cooperate with the Lao government in formulating measures to quickly normalize the situation in the country?

However, this obviously most effective way to eliminate the source of Laotian tension seems to be the least in line with the objectives of the aforementioned Western political groups, and thus the Laotian slander was brought to an international forum such as the United Nations Security Council, and the resolution to establish a subcommittee on Laos was illegally passed. This subcommittee is said to have sent "observers" to Laos. These actions mean undermining the agreement on the Lao International Supervisory and Control Commission, which is not only a serious blow to the Geneva Agreements on Laos, but also a serious blow to the entire set of Geneva Agreements on Indochina. The Soviet government cannot fail to point out that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, as the initiators of the aforementioned resolution, bear full responsibility for this; such behavior may have far-reaching consequences for peace and security in Indochina. In view of this situation, one cannot ignore the belligerent remarks of American generals and leaders of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, who are clamoring to prepare to immediately use the armed forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states, primarily the armed forces of the United States, to conduct extensive military intervention in Laos.

Western Countries Want to Shift Responsibility for the Situation to the Sananikone Government

The actions of Western countries undoubtedly show that they want to use this approach to shift the responsibility for the current situation in Laos to the Sananikone government, while clamoring around the provocative slander that forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have invaded Laos, in order to deceive world public opinion.

It cannot be denied that the United States State Department is playing an unsavory role in this regard, as it has adopted its usual trick - declaring that the recent events in Laos are the result of "foreign communist interference." However, this approach is commonplace. Whenever it wants to cover up the United States' reckless interference in the internal affairs of other countries, the State Department resorts to this trick. As for Laos, this interference is being carried out by sending American military advisors and instructors to the country, as well as importing weapons and various military supplies.

However, no matter what slanders the Sananikone government and its protectors fabricate, they cannot conceal the fact that this government has refused to fulfill the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the Vientiane Agreements, used force against soldiers of the former Pathet Lao combat forces who should have been incorporated into the Lao regular army, arrested Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, implemented terror and persecution against personnel of the former Pathet Lao side, and attempted to stifle democratic forces that advocate Laos' implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality and advocate the participation of participants in the national liberation struggle in Lao social life. The fault for the current state of division in Laos and the armed activities taken by residents dissatisfied with the actions of the Sananikone government lies entirely with the Sananikone government and those who prompted it to violate the Geneva Agreements. Does not the fact that Lao patriotic forces are only demanding that the Sananikone government resume compliance with and further implementation of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements also confirm this point?

The Soviet government believes that the tensions that have arisen in Laos can and should only be resolved on the basis and within the scope of the Geneva Agreements, because the Geneva Agreements are the foundation of peace and security in Indochina. The Soviet government deeply regrets that Western countries are willing to use the Security Council to undermine these agreements and to incite actions aimed at tearing them up.

The Soviet government believes that maintaining the Geneva Agreements on Indochina is its inescapable obligation, because abolishing these agreements would mean eliminating the only legal basis for maintaining peace in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. In this regard, the Soviet government fully understands and shares the unease and concern shown by the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the Republic of India, and other countries concerned with maintaining and consolidating peace and security regarding the situation formed in Laos.

In order to resolve the Laotian issue and normalize the situation in the region, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to rapidly convene a meeting of the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to discuss the situation that has formed in Laos. The Soviet government believes that the Lao International Supervisory and Control Commission should report to the aforementioned conference on the results of its work and its proposed recommendations for normalizing the situation in Laos.

The Soviet government hopes that this proposal of the Soviet government will receive the support of the governments of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference on Indochina.
