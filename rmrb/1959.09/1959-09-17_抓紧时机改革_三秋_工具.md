    Seize the Opportunity to Reform "Three Autumns" Tools
    The Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Leading Organs held an on-site meeting, requiring all localities to fully mobilize the masses, resolutely implement the policy of adapting to local conditions, utilizing materials and skills, emphasizing both repair and new construction, and considering large, medium, and small sizes, to quickly complete the task of repairing and manufacturing 7.4 million pieces of farm equipment.
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: Inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the skilled craftsmen and vast numbers of commune members in various parts of Shanxi Province are actively working to reap a good autumn harvest and sow wheat well, setting off a wave of tool reform to dedicate even greater achievements to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
    This year, the autumn crops on more than 45 million mu in Shanxi Province are generally growing with thick stalks, large ears, and full grains. Therefore, the tasks of harvesting, transporting, and threshing are particularly heavy. This year, the wheat planting area in the province will be expanded by 18% compared with last year, and rational close planting must be universally implemented. The work of autumn plowing should also be carried out on the basis of general plowing, with a plowing depth of six to eight inches. In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor and animal power, the people's communes in various regions, focusing closely on the "Three Autumns" work, have launched a mass tool reform campaign, taking into account the characteristics of this year's large autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing tasks, short time frame, and high quality requirements.
    The people's communes in the Jinnan area, where wheat is abundant, such as Yuncheng and Houma, have adopted the method of field testing, repeated research, and three-level finalization. By the end of August, they had transformed more than 16,360 close-planting drills suitable for use in irrigated land, dry land, and mountain slopes. These drills have been put into the current wheat sowing campaign, ensuring fast progress and good quality of the sowing work. The people's communes in Shuoxian County, with 50 farm tool repair factories as the core and 1,435 skilled craftsmen as the backbone, have formed 194 specialized farm tool repair teams, which go deep into the management areas and production teams to repair and assemble farm tools on a rotating basis. In the past half month, they have repaired and manufactured more than 110,000 pieces of large and small farm tools such as sickles, wooden shovels, wooden forks, plows, and drills, achieving major repairs and manufacturing without leaving the commune, and minor repairs and manufacturing without leaving the village.
    In order to promote the further development of the "Three Autumns" tool reform movement, the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Construction Department recently held a provincial "Three Autumns" tool reform on-site meeting in Fanshi County, Jinbei area. Through visits, discussions, and exchange of experiences. The meeting called on all localities to seize the current time, fully mobilize the masses, resolutely implement the principle of adapting to local conditions, utilizing materials and skills, emphasizing both repair and new construction, and considering large, medium, and small sizes, focusing on the manufacture and promotion of small farm tools such as sickles and hoes, as well as deep plows, close-planting drills, threshing tools, and vehicles, and striving to complete the task of repairing and improving more than 7.4 million pieces of farm tools in the shortest possible time, to dedicate to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    抓紧时机改革“三秋”工具
    山西省农业领导机关召开现场会议，要求各地充分发动群众，坚决贯彻因地制宜，因材施技，修旧增新并举，大中小兼顾的方针，迅速完成修造七百四十万件农具的任务。
    新华社太原讯　山西省各地人民公社的能工巧匠和广大社员，在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，积极为收好秋，种好麦，掀起了工具改革的热潮，以更大的成就向国庆十周年献礼。
    今年，山西省四千五百多万亩秋作物普遍生长得秆粗穗大，籽粒饱满。因此，收割、运输、脱粒工作任务特别繁重；今年全省小麦播种面积将比去年扩大18％，要普遍实行合理密植；秋耕地工作也要在普耕的基础上，耕翻深度达到六寸到八寸。各地人民公社根据今年秋收、秋种、秋耕任务大，时间短，要求质量高，而又同时进行的特点，为了解决劳畜力不足问题，紧紧围绕三秋工作，掀起一个群众性的工具改革热潮。
    盛产小麦的晋南专区运城、侯马等十一个县、市人民公社，采取了实地试验，反复研究，三级定型的办法，到8月底已改造成适合水地、旱地、山坡地使用的密植耧一万六千三百六十多张，这些耧已经投入了当前小麦播种运动，保证了播种工作进度快，质量好。朔县各人民公社以五十个农具修配厂为核心，以一千四百三十五名能工巧匠为骨干，分别组成了一百九十四个农具修配专业小组，深入各管理区和生产队，巡回修配农具，在最近半个月内修造镰刀、木锨、木?、犁、耧等大小农具十一万多件，做到了大修大造不出社，小修小造不出村。
    为了推动“三秋”工具改革运动的进一步发展，最近，山西省农业建设厅，在晋北地区的繁峙县召开了全省“三秋”工具改革现场会议，通过参观，座谈，交流了经验。会议要求各地抓紧当前时间，充分发动群众，坚决贯彻因地制宜、因材施技、修旧增新并举、大中小兼顾的方针，抓住镰刀、镢锹等小农具和深耕犁、密植耧、脱粒工具、车辆的制造和推广，争取用最短的时间，完成修理和改良大小农具七百四十多万件的任务，向国庆十周年献礼。
