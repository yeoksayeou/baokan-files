    The Sun Rises Here
    Li Ji
    The morning glow burns red across ten thousand miles of sea waves, a red sun rises from here into the sky. The red sun shines with ten thousand beams of light, illuminating the green mountains and golden plains. Gazing from Eagle Horn Pavilion, our situation has never been better than today. The morning glow burns red across ten thousand miles of sea waves, a red sun rises from here into the sky. The People's Commune is like the red sun emerging from the sea, embraced by waves soaring into the bright and clear sky. Six hundred and fifty million hands hold high this red sun, it will shine upon our descendants for ten thousand generations!

    太阳从这儿升起
    李季朝霞烧红万里海浪，一颗红太阳从这儿升上天。红日耀耀光芒千万丈，照遍绿色的山水金黄色的大平原。鹰角亭上放眼观望，我们的时势从来没有好过今天。朝霞烧红万里海浪，一颗红太阳从这儿升上天。人民公社就像红日出海上，波涛簇拥飞上朗朗晴空间。六亿五千万双手高举这颗红太阳，它将照耀我们子孙万代千年万年！
    9月5日晨5时半于北戴河海滨归来时写。
