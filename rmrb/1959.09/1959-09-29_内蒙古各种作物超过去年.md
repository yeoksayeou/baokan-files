Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 28th: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved a general bumper harvest of grain, oil crops, and other crops in the first year after communization. The average yield per mu of the 8.4 million mu of spring wheat that has already been harvested throughout the region has increased by 38% compared to last year. The total output of the 6.89 million mu of oil crops and 370,000 mu of sugar beets currently being harvested is expected to increase by 50% to 70% respectively compared to last year. The yield per mu of rice, corn, millet, and sorghum and other crops has also exceeded that of last year's bumper harvest.

Now, from the fertile Hetao Plain to the windy Hulunbuir League fields, an autumn harvest army composed of more than 2 million people of all ethnic groups is launching a major autumn harvest battle to ensure a bumper harvest and pay tribute to the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the country. As of September 22, the entire autonomous region had harvested more than 30 million mu of various crops, accounting for more than 45% of the total sown area. In the Hetao Plain and the southern foothills of the Daqing Mountains, where harvesting began earlier, most of the crops have been harvested.

    内蒙古各种作物超过去年
    据新华社呼和浩特28日电　内蒙古自治区的粮食、油料等作物，在公社化后的第一年里普遍获得丰收。全区已经收获的八百四十多万亩春小麦，平均亩产比去年增长38％；正在收获的六百八十九万多亩油料作物和三十七万多亩甜菜，预计总产量将分别比去年增长五成到七成以上。水稻、玉米、谷子和高粱等农作物的亩产量，也都超过大丰收的去年。
    现在，从富饶的河套平原到寒风飒飒的呼伦贝尔盟田野上，两百多万各族社员组成的秋收大军，掀起秋收大战，保证丰产丰收，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。到9月22日，全自治区已收割各种农作物三千多万亩，占总播种面积45％以上。收割较早的河套平原和大青山南麓一带，大部分作物已收割完毕。
