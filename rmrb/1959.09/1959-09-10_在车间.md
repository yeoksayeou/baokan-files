    In the Workshop	Guo Huang
    The converter sprays a roaring flame!
    Like magma surging! Waves splashing!
    The white heat scorches the eyes,
    At the furnace mouth, a young man is busy.
    The molten iron reflects red on his body,
    Sweat bathes his determined face,
    He swings a long steel pry bar with both hands,
    Probing into the volcano-like furnace.
    He is writing poetry with a steel bar,
    Dipping into the fiery molten iron, fiery vows,
    The sound of the blower hums in the furnace,
    As if singing his soaring enthusiasm.
    The Party branch committee member comes over to ask if he has read the communique and resolutions,
    He seems not to hear clearly, pointing to his heart;
    When I approach and hand him a cup of tea,
    I see him! Holding the resolution tightly against his chest!

    在车间	郭煌
    转炉喷射熊熊的火焰！
    像岩浆怒涌！海浪飞溅！
    白热照得灼人眼痛，
    炉门口，忙碌着一个青年。
    铁水映得他浑身发红，
    汗珠沐浴他坚毅的脸，
    他双手抡起长柄钢钎，
    ?向火山似的炉膛里面。
    他是在用钢钎写诗啊，
    蘸着火红的铁水，火红的誓言，
    鼓风机的声音在炉膛里嗡嗡，
    好像在歌唱他的干劲冲天。
    支委走来问看没看公报和决议，
    他像没听清，指了指心间；
    当我走拢递给他一杯茶，
    看见他啊！把决议紧贴在胸前！
