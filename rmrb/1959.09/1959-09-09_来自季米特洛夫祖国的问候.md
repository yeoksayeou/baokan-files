    Greetings from the Motherland of Dimitrov
    People's Artist of Bulgaria, Deputy to the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Peter Dimitrov
    Dear Chinese friends! It gives me immense pleasure to have the opportunity, on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the Bulgarian people's overthrow of bourgeois fascist rule and the establishment of the People's Democratic regime in Bulgaria, to express the genuine feelings of happiness of the entire Bulgarian people and its intellectuals.
    During my visit to your enchanting homeland, I saw many things and understood some wise truths, for which I am very grateful. I remember a Chinese proverb that says: "One thinks of one's relatives all the more on festive occasions." The Bulgarian people are welcoming the fifteenth anniversary of their National Day with outstanding achievements on the economic and cultural fronts. We are confident that our friends throughout the socialist camp, as well as the loyal fighters around the world who are striving for peace and progress, are sharing in the joy of the Bulgarian people. The Bulgarian people are proud of the achievements they have made in the struggle to realize socialism.
    The question can only be this: Whoever is completely devoted to the great and profoundly humanitarian ideas of Marxism-Leninism will be delighted to welcome every achievement of friends and comrades in the common great struggle for the bright future of mankind.
    The Bulgarian people have something to rejoice about and be proud of. For fifteen years since September 9, 1944, the Bulgarian people have been able, under the leadership of their beloved Communist Party and with the friendly assistance of the entire socialist camp, primarily the powerful Soviet Union, to build a socialist country on the ruins of backward bourgeois Bulgaria.
    The Party and the People's Government spare no effort or money in developing the people's culture. It is enough to cite the following fact to illustrate the point: Today there are forty-three state theaters in the country, whereas before September 9, 1944, only three theaters were state-funded. Over the past fifteen years, many magnificent theaters and hundreds of cultural palaces and clubs have been built in the country. Amateur cultural activities in the country have developed unprecedentedly, and the excellent troupes among them have reached the level of professional skill. The tours of such outstanding troupes as the Moscow "Maly Theater" and the theater named after the "Moscow Soviet," as well as the visits of outstanding Soviet cultural figures to our country, have enriched our drama with valuable experience and promoted its further healthy development. Many of our troupes have gone on tour to other countries. Troupes from other countries have also come to our country for tours.
    The People's Government has built dedicated buildings with audience halls and rehearsal halls for the Higher Institute of Dramatic Arts. The establishment of this institute has promoted the growth of young actors who successfully work on the stages of our theaters.
    The recently concluded Bulgarian National Drama Festival marked the undeniable achievements of Bulgarian drama, which significantly improved the artistic level of the drama. The method of socialist realism is increasingly becoming the only correct creative method for our drama. Our drama has fully embraced this method because our drama has stood on a healthy realistic position from the very beginning of its existence, and in this respect, it also has its own tradition. Soviet dramatic art, which is both spiritually and linguistically close to us, has provided invaluable assistance to the development of our dramatic cause.
    Bulgarian drama workers are learning from the experiences of Russian and Soviet drama, creatively mastering the foundation of acting skills, which was established by its outstanding representatives, and first and foremost by the genius Stanislavsky. They are doing everything possible to better respond to the care of the Party and the People's Government for the development of dramatic art.
    Needless to say, our work has shortcomings. It is not so easy to climb to the summit of socialist art. However, what is important is that the road to the summit is correct, which is a guarantee for our drama to achieve new and more significant achievements.
    As loyal and reliable friends of the Chinese people, we are particularly happy to welcome every achievement of our Chinese colleagues. I cannot praise enough the Chinese classical drama, which is full of emotion, very exciting, and highly artistic.
    The achievements of the fraternal Chinese modern drama also make us rejoice. It embodies on its stage the heroic struggle of the Chinese working people against the oppression of the reactionaries, as well as their heroic struggle to build a socialist society. The infinite loyalty of the Chinese drama workers, who are building the glorious future of their motherland shoulder to shoulder with the working people in urban and rural areas, makes us praise them.
    We watch the work of our Chinese colleagues with great concern. We are very happy when we learn about their achievements and new performances. For example, the "Thirteen Tombs Reservoir Capriccio" performed by the Beijing Youth Art Theater left us with the most delightful impression. The author of this script is our good friend Tian Han. Both the author of the script and the actors of the theater worked together at the construction site of the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir near Beijing. This enabled them to create a moving play.
    Chinese friends are delighted with our achievements in socialist construction, and we are excited about their achievements in socialist construction. The friendship between us is pure, fraternal, and great, and therefore invincible.

    来自季米特洛夫祖国的问候
    保加利亚人民演员  保加利亚人民共和国国民议会代表  彼·季米特洛夫
    亲爱的中国朋友们！使我万分高兴的是，我有机会在保加利亚人民推翻资产阶级法西斯统治和建立保加利亚人民民主政权十五周年的日子，表达全体保加利亚人民及其知识分子的那种真正幸福的感情。
    在我访问你们的迷人的祖国期间，我看到了很多东西，懂得了一些英明的道理，这是非常值得感谢的。我记得中国有一句俗话是：“每逢佳节倍思亲”。保加利亚人民以经济和文化战线上的卓越成就迎接了国庆十五周年。我们确信，我们整个社会主义阵营的朋友们，以及全世界为争取和平与进步而斗争的忠诚的战士们，都在分享着保加利亚人民的喜悦。保加利亚人民以他们在为实现社会主义而斗争中取得的成就而自豪。
    问题只能是这样的。凡是完全献身于伟大的具有深刻人道主义的马克思列宁主义思想的人，都会欢欣鼓舞地欢迎在争取人类光明未来的共同的伟大斗争中的朋友和同志的每一项成就。
    保加利亚人民有值得欢欣鼓舞和自豪的东西。从1944年9月9日起的十五年来，保加利亚人民能够在自己亲爱的共产党的领导下，在整个社会主义阵营首先是强大的苏联的友好援助下，在落后的资产阶级保加利亚的废墟上建设社会主义国家。
    党和人民政府在发展人民文化方面是不吝惜力量和金钱的。只消举出下面这一事实就足以说明问题了。那就是今天国内有四十三家国家剧院，而在1944年9月9日以前，受国家资助的只有三个剧院。十五年来，国内建成了很多华美的剧院和成百的文化宫和俱乐部。国内的业余文娱活动有了空前的发展，其中优秀的剧团已经达到了专业技巧的水平。像莫斯科“小剧院”和以“莫斯科苏维埃”命名的剧院这些杰出剧团的巡回演出，以及杰出的苏联文化活动家来我国访问，都以宝贵的经验丰富了我们的戏剧，促进它的进一步的健康发展。我们的好多剧团到其他国家去作巡回演出。其他国家的剧团也来我国作巡回演出。
    人民政府为高等戏剧学院建设了有观众大厅和排练大厅的专用楼房。这一学院的建立，促进了年青演员的成长，他们成功地在我国剧院的舞台上工作。
    不久以前结束的保加利亚民族话剧会演，标志着保加利亚戏剧有着无可争辩的成就，它显著地提高了戏剧的艺术水平。社会主义现实主义方法，日益成为我国戏剧唯一正确的创作方法。我们的戏剧完全接受了这一方法。因为我们的戏剧从它存在的初期起就站在健康的现实主义立场上，而且在这方面它还有自己的传统。在精神和语言方面都使我们感到亲切的、苏维埃的戏剧艺术，对我国的戏剧事业的发展给予了不可估价的援助。
    保加利亚戏剧工作者在学习俄罗斯的和苏维埃戏剧的经验，创造性地掌握演员技巧的基础，这一基础是由它的杰出代表人物，而首先是天才的斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基制定的。他们尽一切可能更好地回答党和人民政府对于发展戏剧艺术的关怀。
    不消说，我们的工作是有缺点的。要攀登社会主义艺术的顶峰是不那么容易的。但是，重要的是通往顶峰的道路是正确的，这是我们戏剧达到新的更显著的成就的保障。
    作为中国人民的忠诚可靠的朋友，我们特别高兴地欢迎我们中国同行的每一项成就。我对中国古典戏剧称颂不已，这是一种充满感情、十分激动人心和具有高度艺术性的戏剧。
    兄弟般的中国的现代戏剧的成就，也使我们欢欣鼓舞。它在自己的舞台上体现了中国劳动人民反对反动派压迫的英勇斗争，以及他们争取建立社会主义社会的英勇斗争。中国戏剧工作者肩并肩地和城乡劳动者一起创建自己祖国的光辉的未来，他们对人民的无限忠诚使我们称颂不已。
    我们怀着十分关切的心情注视着我们中国同行的工作。当我们知道他们的成就和新的演出时，我们非常高兴。比如，北京青年艺术剧院演出的“十三陵水库畅想曲”，给我们留下了最欣快的印象。这个剧本的作者是我们的好朋友田汉。无论是剧本的作者和剧院的演员们都一道在北京附近的十三陵水库工地上工作过。这就使他们能够创造出激动人心的剧作。
    中国朋友们对我们在社会主义建设中的成就感到欣快，我们对他们在社会主义建设中的成就也感到兴奋。我们之间的友谊，是纯洁的、兄弟般的、伟大的，因此也就是不可战胜的。
