Greetings to Lanzhou
　　Lǐ Xiùfēng

Dear Comrade:

　　I am truly delighted to hear that you are coming to Lanzhou in this season of crisp autumn air, clear skies, and gentle breezes. However, we Lanzhou people are somewhat displeased that you imagine Lanzhou as an ancient battlefield with boundless sands, howling north winds, desolate weeds, and bone-chilling cold.

　　Yes, Lanzhou has a past of great suffering and a history stained with blood and tears. But the earth-shattering sounds of the cannons at liberation have long turned these into relics of history. Now it is: songs fill the hundred-mile-long street, and laughter flies from thousands of homes!

　　If you don’t believe it, come to Lanzhou and climb White Pagoda Mountain, and look down on the city of Lanzhou. Then you will see beneath the exquisite White Pagoda and above the towering pavilions: the Yellow River stretches far to meet the azure sky, presses close to the green fields, shattering thousands of mountains and ridges, rolling up turbulent waves and surging torrents, rushing towards the sea; and Lanzhou is divided north and south by the great river. Please do not worry, on this arrogant torrent, there are not only bridges and steamers, but also from the time the morning sun climbs the eastern sky, and the river surface shimmers with golden light, and the whistles of steamers resound far and near, rafts fully loaded with fertilizer, like sea swallows and sand gulls, speed through the raging waves, cutting through the golden light waves, sailing towards the green oases in the lower reaches of the river. Until a bright moon hangs high in the sky, the night is deep, and thousands of lights are on, they still ride the wind and waves, rushing back and forth, carrying rafts full of fruits and also carrying rafts full of moonlight, concentrated at the ancient iron bridge, supplying the market. You will see: not far to the east, there is a lush green island, two silver glittering white ribbons, the island reflects endless spring, the white ribbons roll up thousands of piles of snow, green and white complement each other, full of poetic charm. This island is Yantan, and these white ribbons are the Yellow River. Yantan is one of the melon, fruit and vegetable islands in the Lanzhou River, and also one of the scenic spots. There are towering black trees, orchards laden with fruit, endless vegetable fields, and brightly colored flowers. If you like activities, on the artificial lake, sometimes the surface is as smooth as a mirror, sometimes the waves ripple, in the sound of wind, the sound of water, the sound of oars, and light laughter, you will enjoy new happiness. And mainly you will see: tall buildings, towering chimneys, light and airy plumes of smoke, red flags fluttering in the wind, between the high mountains and the great river, among the green trees and fragrant flowers, stretching endlessly, meandering east and west, you cannot see the beginning, you cannot see the end. At this time, you may want to ask about the size of Lanzhou. People will tell you that the Party led the working people, and in just ten years, expanded Lanzhou, which occupied less than 1.5 square kilometers in old China, by forty or fifty times. The long street, which is about to be completely connected by brand-new buildings, is already more than a hundred *li* long. This is Lanzhou, standing on the banks of the roaring Yellow River, at the foot of the majestic Gaolan Mountain; this is Lanzhou, the center of the motherland.

　　Speaking of Lanzhou, you will always remember the Yellow River, a natural barrier described as "The water of the Yellow River comes from the sky, rushing to the sea never to return;" you will always remember: the Yellow River Iron Bridge in Lanzhou, formerly known as one of the three major bridges in the motherland. The rulers' skill is to cruelly exploit and savagely kill; they love money, beauties, red lights, and green wine. As for doing things, they are all first-class big dummies. The bridge, built by Sheng Yun, Governor of Gansu in the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, not only took more than two years and cost 300,000 taels of silver, but some working people were buried in the torrents, and some were exhausted on the piers. The German rogue, Kaso, who contracted the project, and the American swindler, Manbaoben, filled their pockets and returned home loaded with wealth, using the blood and sweat of the Chinese people to feed their red cheeks. And the rulers also erected stone tablets to sing their praises and virtues. From 1954 to this spring, in just a few years, we have built nine bridges over the perilous Yellow River. Including those under construction, there will be thirteen bridges. Some of these bridges are connected by three arch beams of more than fifty meters long; some are composed of five holes of forty meters long and two holes of thirty meters long reinforced concrete cantilever beams... The Party leads the people, with wisdom and hands, in a very short time, at a very fast speed, builds nine rainbows on the Yellow River, connects the north and south of the great river into one piece; the ancient natural barrier is transformed into a thoroughfare.

　　You, who love heavy industry, may have noticed the industry in Lanzhou in old China. That is: only a few broken belt lathes in the Gansu Machinery Factory; the Lanzhou Power Plant with an installed capacity of only more than 900 kilowatts; the wool textile factory using machines from the Empress Dowager Cixi era. But in just ten years, the Party and the people have made Lanzhou full of chimneys and full of vigor, initially possessing the scale of a heavy industrial city. Let’s not mention the general factories for the time being, just take a car along the West Jin Road, which is lined with tall buildings, surrounded by green trees, and wide and flat, and drive forty *li* to see the projects above the limit of the first five-year plan. Most of this area used to be desolate sandy land, lush weeds, where foxes and rabbits haunted, and eagles circled. Today, in the vast complex of buildings, you first see a large chimney more than 100 meters high, standing on the bank of the Yellow River, raising its head to the blue sky. It is like an angry dragon. Day and night, it relentlessly spews out a fiery flame more than ten feet long, painting the blue sky with red ribbons, and making the silver stars lose their brilliance. What is this place? This is the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant, which is equivalent to 120 times the power generation of the old Lanzhou Power Plant, supplying more than 200 tons of steam to nearby factories every hour, both generating electricity and supplying heat, this is the chimney of the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant. You will also see: under the blue sky and autumn sun, on a plant site covering more than 2 square kilometers, rows of refining towers stand tall, competing for beauty; horizontal and vertical oil tanks, sparkling and shining; trains and cars, roaring and flying, emitting colorful rays of light, interwoven into a moving movement. What is this place? This is the most advanced integrated oil refining enterprise in China at present, with more than 30 kinds of products, and the annual output far exceeds the oil refining volume of old China, the Lanzhou Oil Refinery. You will also see: rows of pools, like mirrors in myths, and like lakes on the earth. In the mirror are lingering blue sky and white clouds, and floating graceful figures. Here you will feel refreshed and enlightened. What is this place? This is the Lanzhou Tap Water Plant, which filters the silt of the Yellow River, supplies people with clean water, and produces the highest standard of water for 10 million people a day and night. You will also see: more than 180 kilometers of process pipelines, crisscrossing and spreading throughout the plant; large gas cabinets up to 36 meters high and with a capacity of more than 22,000 cubic meters; high-speed turbo compressors rotating at more than 4,000 revolutions per minute; and an electric compressor with a machine shaft weighing 20 tons. These things will give people greatness and amazement, but more of excitement and pride. What is this place? This is the Lanzhou Chemical Plant, whose annual fertilizer production can increase grain production equivalent to the grain output of two or three counties. Of course, you can drive west to visit the Yongdeng Cement Plant; you can also turn east to visit the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant. These are the six great pillars that support the sky, and also the six wonderful flowers that press the ground, they give Lanzhou new life and new light!

　　After the tour, you may be hot and tired, then Lanzhou, one of the famous melon and fruit cities of the motherland, will not disappoint its guests. The intoxicating melon with fragrant wine flavor, the watermelon with sandy pulp and plenty of juice, the Lanzhou melon with a harmonious aroma, plus what Golden Pagoda Temple, Green Fragrant Melon, Golden Toad, Iron Egg... it should be said that it is a dazzling array of beautiful things. It is a pity that you cannot stay until winter to appreciate the world of Lanzhou pears. That is also a variety of flowers blooming, and a variety of colors blooming. The soft sweetness and rich aroma will clear your mind and refresh you, relieving fatigue.

　　Dear comrade, it is truly "the paper is short, but the affection is long, and the meaning is not exhausted." Moreover, I do not have Jiang Yan's pen that produces flowers, even if it is a lengthy article, it cannot express even a fraction of Lanzhou. Fortunately, you are coming, in Lanzhou, you will feel it, its speed of advancement is like a heavenly horse galloping, its sound of advancement is like spring thunder roaring, magnificence contains exquisiteness, and vigor includes tenderness, you will unconsciously fall in love with Lanzhou!

    兰州寄语
  　李秀峰亲爱的同志：
    在这秋高气爽，云淡风轻的季节，得到你要来兰州的消息，我真是高兴极了。不过你把兰州想像成：平沙无际，朔风怒号，塞草萧索，寒气浸骨的古战场，却使我们兰州人有些不快。
    是的，兰州有它苦难重重的已往，血泪斑斑的过去。但解放时惊天动地的炮声，早把这些化作历史的陈迹了。而今则是：百里长街歌声满，千门万户笑语飞！
    不信，你来到兰州登上白塔山，俯瞰一下兰州市容。那你会在玲珑多姿的白塔之下，檐牙高啄的亭阁之上看到：黄河远接碧天，近压绿野，粉碎千山万岭，卷起滔天浊浪汹涌奔腾，驰向大海；而把兰州，横隔在大河南北。请不要耽心，在这骄纵的巨流上，不只有桥梁、有汽船，而且从朝日爬上东天，河面金光荡漾，远近汽笛轰鸣时起，满载肥料的皮筏，如海燕、如沙鸥，驰过惊涛骇浪，划破金色光波，驶向下游的河中绿洲。直到一轮皓月，高悬天空，夜色沉沉，万家灯火时止，还乘风破浪，前奔后驰，载着满筏瓜果，也载着满筏月色，集中到古老的铁桥边，供应市场。你会看到：不远的东方，有一座树木葱茏的孤岛，两条银光闪灼的白练，孤岛映出无尽春，白练卷起千堆雪，绿白互衬，诗意昂然。这孤岛就是雁滩，这白练就是黄河。雁滩是兰州河中瓜果蔬菜洲之一，也是风景区之一。有黛色参天的大树，有果实累累的园林，有一望无际的菜畦，有鲜艳夺目的鲜花。如果你喜欢活动，那人工湖上，有时水平如镜，有时波淀涟漪，在风声、水声、款乃桨声、轻盈笑声中，你将享受新的快乐。而主要的你会看到：高大的楼房，耸立的烟囱，轻盈舒卷的烟带，临风招展的红旗，在高山大河之间，在绿树香花之中，连绵不绝，迤逦东西，望不见头，看不到尾。这时候，你也许要问兰州的大小。人们将告诉你，党领导劳动人民，在短短十年里，把旧中国占地不到一点五平方公里的兰州，扩大了四五十倍。快要完全被崭新的建筑连结起来的长街已经是一百多华里了。这就是矗立在奔腾叫啸的黄河岸边，雄伟嵯峨的皋兰山麓的兰州；这就是祖国中心的兰州。
    提到兰州，你总会记起：“黄河之水天上来，奔流到海不复回”的黄河天险；总会记起：过去称作祖国三大桥梁之一，兰州的黄河铁桥。统治者的本领，是残酷地剥削，狰狞地杀戮；爱好的是金钱美人，红灯绿酒。至于办事，全是天字第一号的大草包。清光绪时代，甘肃总督升允兴建的这座桥梁，不只耗费了两年多的时间，用掉了三十万两纹银，而劳动人民，有些葬身于洪流之中，有些累倒在桥墩之上。承包的德国流氓喀佐斯，设计的美国骗子满宝本，则充箱盈囊，满载而归，用中国人民的血汗，去喂红他们的双腮。而统治者还为立石树碑，歌功颂德。从1954年到今春，短短的几年里，我们在天险的黄河上，架起了九座桥梁。连同施工的在内，将有十三座桥梁出现。这些桥梁，有的是用三个五十多米长的拱梁连成的；有的是用五孔四十米长，二孔三十米长的钢筋混凝土悬臂式梁组成的……党领导人民，以智慧和双手，以极短的时间，以极快的速度，在黄河上架起九道长虹，把大河南北，连成一片；千古天险，化作通衢。
    爱好重工业的你，可能留意过旧中国的兰州工业。那就是：只有几部破旧皮带车床的甘肃机器厂；装机容量仅九百多瓩的兰州电厂；用着慈禧太后时代机器的毛纺织厂。但短短十年，党和人民，已使兰州烟囱林立，气象万千，初具了重工业城市的规模。一般工厂暂时不提，就请你驱车沿着高楼连绵，绿树萦绕，宽阔平坦的西津路，奔驰四十华里，看看第一个五年计划限额以上的项目吧。这里原来大部分是漠漠平沙，苍苍荒草，狐兔出没，雄鹰盘旋的地方。而今天，在广阔无垠的建筑群里，你先看到耸立黄河之滨，昂头青天之边，一座一百多米高的大烟囱。它像愤怒的苍龙。日夜不息，喷射着一丈多长的烈焰，给青天涂上红带，使银星丧失光芒。这是什么地方呢？这里就是等于旧兰州电厂发电量一百二十倍，每小时供给邻近工厂二百多吨蒸汽，既发电、又供热的兰州热电厂，这就是兰州热电厂的烟囱。你又会看到：在蓝天秋阳之下，在占地二平方公里多的厂址上，林立的炼塔，争妍斗奇；纵横的油罐，闪光发亮；火车汽车，轰鸣飞奔，放射着多采的光芒，交织成动人的乐章。这是什么地方呢？这就是我国目前最先进的综合炼油企业，产品已有三十多种，年产量远远超过旧中国炼油量的兰州炼油厂。你还会看到：一排排的水池，既像神话里的明镜，又像大地上的湖泊。镜里有徘徊的蓝天白云，有浮动的绰约人影。在这里你会感到心旷神怡，豁然开朗。这是什么地方呢？这就是滤涤黄河泥沙，供给人民清水，一昼夜生产可供一千万人最高标准用水量一天的兰州市自来水厂。你更会看到：有一百八十多公里长，纵横交错，遍布全厂的工艺管道；有高达三十六米，容量二万二千多立方米的大汽柜；有每分钟转四千多转，高速的涡轮压缩机；有一个机轴，重达二十吨的电动压缩机。这些东西，会给人们以伟大和惊异，但更多的是兴奋和骄傲。这是什么地方呢？这就是所产化肥一年增产粮食可顶两三个县粮食产量的兰州化工厂。当然，你可以驱车西去，参观永登水泥厂；你也可以掉车东来，访问兰州石油机器厂。这是撑天的六根大柱，也是压地的六朵奇花，它们给兰州以新的生命，新的光芒！
    游罢归来，你可能满身燥热，一片疲倦，那祖国瓜果名城之一的兰州，是不会辜负它的嘉宾的。酒味芬芳的醉瓜、瓤砂汁多的西瓜、香气和顺的兰州瓜，再加上什么金塔寺、绿香瓜、金蛤蟆、铁蛋子……应该说是琳琅满目，美不胜收。可惜你待不到冬天，欣赏不到兰州梨的世界。那也是花开多种，彩放各色的。柔和的甜味，浓郁的香气，是会清神爽意，解除疲劳。
    亲爱的同志，真是“纸短情长，言不尽意。”而且我没有江淹生花之笔，即使连篇累牍，也不能表达兰州的万一。好在你要来了，在兰州，你就会感到它，前进的速度如天马飞驰，前进的声音如春雷轰鸣，雄伟里含有精致，刚健中包括柔媚，你会不知不觉的爱上兰州！
