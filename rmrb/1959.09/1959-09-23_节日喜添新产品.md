New Products Add Joy to the Festival

On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, people expect the workers of Shanghai, the country's largest light industrial and textile industrial base, to provide them with more festive supplies. Shanghai's 600,000 light industrial and textile workers have not disappointed these expectations. From January to August this year, they have produced a large number of exquisite, beautiful, sturdy and durable new consumer products, most of which have now been successively supplied to the market and are meeting customers.

　　　　"All Over Red" Printed Cloth

The new printed cloth, "All Over Red," symbolizing the prosperity of the motherland's construction undertakings over the past decade and the rich and colorful life of the people, has recently been shipped from Shanghai to all parts of the country.

The "All Over Red" printed cloth was designed by Zhang Ziyu, a designer at the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, who collected various peony flower patterns from Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and other places. After repeated observation and thinking, he carefully designed it. The peonies printed on the cloth, some are budding, some are in full bloom, with luxuriant flowers and leaves, and rich and varied beauty; the color scheme is also harmonious and dazzling.

　　　　　Beautiful Men's Clothing Fabrics

The new products, gabardine and "Spring Light" cloth, jointly produced by the Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory and the Dafeng No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, specially for men to celebrate the festival, are already on the market. These new products are made of a blend of rayon and cotton yarn. The two have different colors, and after fiber modification treatment, they look like sesame tweed. They do not wrinkle easily and resemble woolen fabrics. They can be used by men to make suits and Zhongshan suits.

These fabrics are inexpensive and beautiful, and come in six different colors such as coffee, beige, and cyan-green, breaking the past situation where men's clothing fabrics generally only had a few colors such as blue, gray, and black. Compared with the colorful fabrics for women's clothing, this is undoubtedly good news for men.

　　　　"August 1st" Racing Bike

The domestically produced "August 1st" racing bike is already on the market. This is a new product from the Shanghai Bicycle Factory. The characteristics of this bicycle are that it is sturdy, ingenious, and fast. Its frame is made of seamless steel pipes, the handlebars are made of aluminum alloy, and the fenders are made of plastic. The entire bike weighs only fourteen kilograms, and one person can carry it upstairs with one hand. It is equipped with a transmission device that can change four different speeds at any time when driving at high speed, with a maximum speed of 40 kilometers per hour. A plastic water bottle is also installed on the handlebar, so athletes can drink to their heart's content with just a slight bow of their heads while driving.

This bike made its debut at the Shanghai Municipal Games, where twenty-four athletes rode it and earned the title of sports champion.

　　　　　　New Type Accordion

The most distressed thing for a singer is not having a good band to accompany them; and the most headache for a musician is not having a good instrument. Now, the Shanghai Baili Accordion Factory has manufactured a one hundred and twenty-bass continuous tone-changing accordion, which will become a good assistant for talented accordion players.

The difference between this accordion and the general domestic accordions is that it can continuously change tones and play advanced musical pieces independently. It ensures that when changing timbres continuously at high speed, it will not be interrupted and affect the correctness of the beat, so that the performer can give full play to his artistic talent.

The workers of this factory are actively expanding production, so that it can play beautiful and moving melodies for the people of the whole country during the joyous festival.

　　　　　High-Grade Two-Color Ballpoint Pen

The Fenghua Ballpoint Pen Factory recently produced a unique two-color ballpoint pen as a gift to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Generally, two-color ballpoint pens have two different colored refills installed at both ends of the pen barrel, which is very inconvenient to flip up and down when in use. The Shanghai brand ballpoint pen has red and blue refills installed at one end. If you want to write with the blue refill, just rotate it and the blue comes out; if you want to use red, rotate it again, the blue refill retracts and the red refill extends, which is very convenient.

This ballpoint pen is not only novel in structure and easy to use, but also of high quality. Its ink is made of high-grade pigment solvent, and its light resistance time is four times longer than that of ordinary refill ink, and the blue never fades. It also has a large oil storage capacity, and a refill oil tube can draw a line seven kilometers long. There are currently two types produced, one with a stainless steel sleeve and one with a gold-plated sleeve.

    节日喜添新产品
    在建国十周年的前夕，人们期待着全国最大的轻工业、纺织工业基地——上海的工人为他们提供更多的节日用品。上海六十万轻工、纺织工人，没有辜负人们的期望。今年1月到8月，他们制成了大批精美绮丽、坚固耐用的日用百货新产品，现在，大部分已陆续供应市场，与顾客见面了。
          “满堂红”花布
    象征着祖国十年来的建设事业繁荣昌盛和人民生活丰富多彩的新花布——“满堂红”花布，最近已从上海运到全国各地。
    “满堂红”花布，是国营上海第一印染厂设计师张自煜把苏、杭、沪等地各种不同姿态的牡丹花样搜集在一起，经过反复的观察和思考，然后精心设计出来的。印在布上的牡丹花，有的含苞待放，有的正在盛开，花叶并茂，丰彩多姿；配色也很调和，绚烂夺目。
            美观的男衣料
    上海第一印染厂和达丰第三棉纺厂协作，特为男同志过节赶制的新产品华达呢和春光呢，已经上市。这种新产品是利用人造纤维和棉纱交织而成的，二者色泽不同，再经过纤维变性处理，所以看上去像芝麻呢。不折不绉又像毛料织物。可供男同志做西服和中山装用。
    这种呢料价廉物美，且有咖啡、米黄、青绿等六种不同的颜色，突破了过去男同志服装用布一般只有蓝、灰、黑少数几种颜色的情况。和女同志衣着用布万紫千红相比较，对男同志来说，不能不说是一个喜讯。
          “八一”型赛车
    国产“八一”型赛车已经上市，这是上海自行车厂的新产品。这种自行车的特点是坚固、经巧、速度快。它的车架，由无缝钢管制成，车把用的是铝合金，而挡板则用塑料做成。整部车子，总重量只有十四公斤，一个人一只手就可提上楼。设有变速装置，能在飞快行驶的时候，随时变换四种不同的速度，最快每小时四十公里。在车把上，还装有一只塑料水壶，运动员在行驶中只须略微低头就可以喝个痛快。
    这种车子曾在上海市运动会上初露头角，曾有二十四名运动员骑着它得到运动健将的称号。
                  新型手风琴
    一个歌唱家最苦恼的是没有好的乐队伴奏；而一个乐师最头疼的，莫过于没有好乐器。现在，上海百乐手风琴制造厂制造成一种一百二十倍司连续变音器手风琴，它会成为天才手风琴手的好助手。
    这种手风琴与目前国内一般的手风琴不同之处是：能连续变音和单独演奏高级的乐曲，它保证在连续高速度地变换音色时，不会间断和影响节拍正确，因而能使演奏者尽情地发挥他的艺术天才。
    这家工厂的工人，正积极扩大生产，让它为全国人民在欢乐的节日，弹奏出美好动听的曲调。
              高级双色圆珠笔
    丰华圆珠笔厂最近制成一种独具一格的双色圆珠笔，向建国十周年献礼。
    一般双色圆珠笔是把两种不同颜色的笔芯安装在笔杆两头，用时翻上翻下，十分不便。上海牌圆珠笔是把红蓝两种不同颜色的笔芯装在一头。如欲用蓝色笔芯书写，一旋转，则蓝出；如欲用红色，一旋转，蓝笔芯缩进去，红笔芯伸出来，十分简便。
    这种圆珠笔不但结构新颖、使用简便，而且质量较高。它的油墨是用高级颜料溶剂调成，耐晒时间比一般笔芯油墨要长四倍，蓝的永不褪色。它的储油量也大，一技笔芯油管可以划一条七公里的长线。目前生产两种，一种是不锈钢套，一种是包金套。
