Planning

The kerosene lamp burns the night,
The commune leader's ideological flame burns even higher.
The heroic words at the heroes' meeting,
Surge in his heart like rolling waves.
The hand holding the pen,
Exerts all its strength,
He wants to write on this white paper,
The ideals of all the people of the commune.
An extraordinary ingenuity,
Combines the wishes of thirteen thousand people,
Even a gentle stroke,
Is the brilliance of wisdom shining.
Fearing to fail the trust of the people,
The commune leader carefully examines the plan again and again;
But he finally smiles,
Because he sees the wings of life spread open.
High-rise buildings, power stations, canals, chimneys...
A radiant golden sun,
Carrying the enthusiasm of all the people of the commune,
Flying towards a better life.
A burst of rooster crows wafts from outside the window,
The commune leader's heroic spirit is not exhausted,
He quietly comes to a small hill,
Facing the night wind, he opens the curtains of memory.
Just below this small hill,
Lies the thirty years of fire and blood;
People used tears to send the Red Army north,
Used hatred to treat the reactionaries' atrocities.
People pass, the grass is cut three times, fire passes,
The revolutionary hometown burns in the sea of fire.
The white bandits boast triumphantly:
"Where the Red Army has been, not even a blade of grass will be left."
The grass burned by fire is even greener,
The pine trees that have survived the winter are even more vigorous,
The persecuted people carried the red flag back,
The steel that has been through fire is three times harder.
Relying on the memory retained in their hearts,
Rebuilding their own homeland,
The commune leader's hand that once held the red-tasseled spear,
Has added another layer of calluses.
Recording this history of revolutionary struggle,
Isn't it a glorious poem of a heroic era?
Erecting a stele on the small hill,
Isn't it a red flag planted in people's hearts?
The red glow smiles and climbs up the horizon,
The commune leader spreads out the plan in front of him,
He seems to solemnly declare:
A new and great change is about to appear!

    规划
    郑伯权煤油灯在把黑夜燃烧，社长的思想火焰燃得更高，群英会上的豪言壮语，在心头涌着像滚滚波涛。握着笔杆的手，使出了全身力量，他要在这一方白纸上面，写下全公社人民的理想。一颗非凡的匠心，凝合了一万三千人的愿望，那怕是轻轻的一笔，也是智慧闪射的光芒。唯恐辜负了众人的嘱托，社长再三把规划端详；可是他终于笑了，因为他看到了生活张开的翅膀高楼、电站、运河、烟囱……一颗光辉灿烂的金阳，带着全公社人民的热情，向着美好的生活飞翔。窗外飘来一阵阵鸡声，社长的豪兴未尽，他悄步来到小丘上，迎着夜风打开了记忆的窗帘。就在这小丘下面，记载着火与血的三十年；人们用泪水送红军北上，用仇恨对待反动派的暴行。人过三刀草过火，革命的故乡在火海里烧。白狗子得意夸下海口：
  “红军到过的地方草不留根”。火烧过的野草更青，熬过冬的松树更苍劲，被迫害的人们扛着红旗回来了见过火的钢又硬了三分。凭着保留在心里的记忆，重建自己的家园，社长那拿过红缨枪的手，又加上了一层老茧。记下这革命斗争的历史，岂不是英雄时代的光辉诗篇？在小丘上立一块碑石，岂不是一面红旗插在人们心间？红霞笑着爬上了天边，社长把规划展开在面前，他仿佛在庄严宣告：一个新的巨变就要出现！
