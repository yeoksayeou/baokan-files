Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 5th: Inspired by the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Coral People's Commune in Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, has redoubled its efforts and proposed even greater leap forward targets, sparking a production upsurge to strive for an all-round bumper harvest of autumn crops and prepare sufficient base fertilizer for autumn planting.

The Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have been made known to every household and individual in the Coral Commune, becoming a tremendous driving force for a greater leap forward in the entire commune. Within three days of the Communiqué's publication, the commune organized a nearly 10,000-strong anti-drought army, irrigating 4,000 mu of sweet potatoes, 1,395 mu of taro, and 2,870 mu of carrots. Simultaneously, they rushed to harvest millet, sorghum, and corn, and applied insecticide powder to all 3,500 mu of rice paddies. They also accumulated an additional 740,000 dan of fertilizer. After studying the Communiqué, all members of the Yanggang Brigade immediately devoted 70% of their labor force to fertilizer accumulation and production. Their slogan is: "Extract gold from the river (river mud), uncover treasure at home (thousand-legged soil), not sparing even an inch of green turf or mud; work hard for ten days, accumulate 600,000 dan of fertilizer, and guarantee 300 dan of base fertilizer per mu for autumn sowing." The commune also replanted 1,530 mu of carrots in a few days.

Based on the enthusiasm and demands of the vast number of cadres and commune members, and in conjunction with the crop growth situation in the region, the Commune Party Committee has revised upwards the autumn grain yield targets. The grain target was originally 504 jin per mu, but has now been raised to 598 jin, an increase of 18.6% compared to the original plan. The peanut target was originally 430 jin per mu, but has now been raised to 470 jin, an increase of 9.3%. The carrot target was originally 4,500 jin per mu, but has now been raised to 6,000 jin, an increase of 33.33% compared to the original plan. These plan revisions have all been discussed and approved by the vast number of commune members, and specific measures have been formulated to achieve the targets. For example, the harvested sorghum, millet, and corn are being threshed again to ensure every grain is stored in the granary, and the measures to increase production of sweet potatoes and taro are being universally intensified. Special attention is being paid to second- and third-class seedlings, with a three-pronged approach of increased fertilization, vine turning, and soil heaping to strengthen management. To ensure the implementation of these measures, the Commune Party Committee is using 40% of the labor force for field management of late autumn crops and 60% of the labor force for large-scale fertilizer accumulation and production. They are determined to work hard for ten days, adding 4.2 million dan to the existing 2.6 million dan, guaranteeing 200 dan of base fertilizer per mu.

While launching a production upsurge, the commune has also launched a widespread upsurge in setting plans for diligence and thrift in household management and increased production and economy. After studying the resolution on increasing production and practicing economy, the members of the First Team of the Wuqiao Brigade proposed the following guarantees: "1. Grow more vegetables and conserve grain; 2. Gather more grass in spare time and conserve fuel; 3. Increase the number of chickens raised per household by two and the number of pigs by one; 4. Maintain good family unity and exceed labor quotas." Currently, the entire commune has launched an upsurge in which brigades are setting increased production targets and households are setting economy plans.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 6th: After studying the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, members of the Zhuanji People's Commune in Jieshou County, Anhui Province, have redoubled their efforts and are determined to increase the full-year agricultural production targets by 25%.

Currently, the commune members are responding to the Party's call with practical actions. On top of two previous applications of fertilizer, late rice in the entire commune has been given an additional 20 jin of cake fertilizer, 10 jin of calcium sulfate, and 45 dan of ash per mu. Soybeans have been given an additional 80 dan of urine fertilizer and 15 dan of human manure per mu. Cotton has been given an additional 80 dan of human manure and urine fertilizer per mu. According to statistics, the more than 22,800 laborers in the entire commune have completed more than 912,000 labor days in the five days after the Communiqué was published, an increase of 30% compared to the previous five days. Commune members are also adopting a method of focusing on key areas combined with comprehensive measures to strengthen weak links in field management. For example, locusts were discovered in more than 130 mu of soybeans in the Lizhuang Production Team. All 138 laborers in the team, along with some auxiliary laborers, completely eliminated the locusts in one day and one night. The Qiuzhuang Production Team discovered that more than 60 mu of late-planted red sweet potato seedlings, planted during the drought, were weak. The production team immediately extracted 49 people from the drought relief labor force and mobilized 26 auxiliary laborers to rush to apply more than 4,800 dan of human manure fertilizer in one day. Now, these weak late-planted red sweet potato seedlings have turned from yellow to green and are growing vigorously. Due to the timely strengthening of field management by the Zhuanji People's Commune, autumn crops throughout the commune are generally growing well. The vast number of commune members are continuing their efforts, further strengthening field management, and striving for an all-round bumper harvest of autumn crops.

    江苏泰兴珊瑚公社提高秋粮产量指标
    安徽界首砖集公社全年指标提高了百分之二十五
    新华社南京5日电　江苏省泰兴县珊瑚人民公社在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，鼓足干劲，提出更大跃进的指标，掀起了争取秋熟全面丰收，为秋播准备好基肥的生产热潮。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议在珊瑚公社已做到家喻户晓，人人皆知，并成为推动全社更大跃进的巨大动力。公报公布后三天内，公社就组织了近一万人的抗旱大军，将四千亩山芋、一千三百九十五亩芋头，二千八百七十亩胡萝卜全部浇了一次水。同时，抢收好粟子、高粱、玉米，将三千五百亩水稻全部用药粉治虫一次。还增积肥料七十四万担。洋港大队的全体社员在学习了公报后，立即以70％的劳力投入积肥造肥运动。他们的口号是：“河里取金（河泥），家里翻宝（千脚土），青草皮泥一寸也不饶，苦干十天，积肥六十万担，保证秋种基肥每亩三百担。”这个公社在几天内还翻种了一千五百三十亩胡萝卜。
    公社党委根据广大干部和社员的干劲和要求，结合本地区的作物生长情况，重新提高了秋熟粮食产量指标，粮食指标原来是亩产五百零四斤，现在提高为五百九十八斤，比原计划上升18.6％；花生原订亩产四百三十斤，现在提高为四百七十斤，上升9.3％；胡萝卜原订亩产四千五百斤，现提高为六千斤，比原计划上升33.33％。这些计划的修订，都经过了广大社员的讨论和通过，并订出了实现指标的具体措施。如将已经登场的高粱、粟子、玉米等重新复打一下，做到颗粒进仓，对山芋、芋头的增产措施普遍加码。特别是对二、三类苗，采用加肥、翻藤、壅土三管齐下的方法，加强管理。为了保证这些措施实现，公社党委以40％的劳力搞晚秋作物的田间管理，以60％的劳力大搞积肥造肥运动。他们决心苦干十天，在现在二百六十万担的基础上，再积四百二十万担，保证每亩基肥二百担。
    这个公社在掀起生产高潮的同时，掀起了普订勤俭持家增产节约的计划热潮。吴桥大队第一小队社员学习了关于增产节约决议以后，他们提出了以下保证：“一、多种蔬菜，节约粮食；二、闲时多拾草，节约燃料；三、在现有的基础上，每户增养二只鸡一头猪；四、家庭团结好，劳动超定额。”目前全公社已掀起队队订增产指标，家家订节约计划的热潮。
    新华社合肥6日电　安徽省界首县砖集人民公社社员学习了党的八届八中全会公报后，干劲倍增，决心将全年农业生产指标提高25％。
    现在，社员们正以实际行动响应党的号召。全社晚稻在追肥两次的基础上，每亩又增施饼肥二十斤，硫酸钙十斤和草木灰四十五担，黄豆每亩又追了尿肥八十担，人粪十五担。棉花每亩又追了人粪和尿肥八十担。据统计全社二万二千八百多个劳力在公报发表后的五天中共做九十一万二千多个劳动
  日，比前五天提高30％。社员还采用重点突击全面结合的办法，加强田间管理中的薄弱环节。如李庄生产队一百三十多亩黄豆发现有蝗虫，全队一百三十八个劳力和部分辅助劳力，在一天一夜内将蝗虫全部消灭，丘庄生产队发现有六十多亩抗旱抢种的晚红芋秧苗瘦弱，这个生产队立即在抗旱劳力中抽出四十九人，还发动了辅助劳力二十六人，突击一天，追人粪肥四千八百多担。现在这些瘦弱的晚红芋秧已由黄转青，生长盛旺。砖集人民公社由于及时加强田间管理，全社秋季作物，普遍生长良好。广大社员正再接再厉，继续加强田间管理，力争秋季作物全面丰收。
