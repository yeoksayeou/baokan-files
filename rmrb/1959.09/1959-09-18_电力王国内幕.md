    Inside the Electric Power Kingdom
    Wei Jiewen

    Since the rise of the electric power kingdom in the nineteenth century, the ancient steam engine kingdom has gradually declined. The emerging electric power kingdom has almost occupied all modern production and even living fields. The supremely powerful electricity is a Hercules; it can be transformed into mechanical kinetic energy, driving machines and controlling operations; it can emit light for illumination; it can generate heat, becoming the incarnation of the sun; it can emit sound, becoming an assistant to the communication soldier; it can cause chemical reactions, such as electrolyzing copper and synthesizing fibers, becoming a magician of manufacturing substances... Electricity can be transmitted regardless of distance, from a few meters to over a thousand kilometers; electricity can be used regardless of time, from fractions of a second to years; electricity can be supplied regardless of quantity, from a few kilowatts to millions of kilowatts; electricity transmits rapidly, traveling 300,000 kilometers per second.

    Within the electric power kingdom, fierce struggles are constantly taking place. First, there is the struggle between the thermal power faction (thermal power generation) and the hydropower faction (hydroelectric power generation). The thermal power faction, backed by mineral resources such as coal and oil, has seen its strength greatly weakened due to the limited resources and the increasing use of oil, coal, and other natural resources by the chemical industry to manufacture various synthetic substances, directly serving to improve people's material lives. The hydropower faction relies on its innate, infinite, and enormous water energy and low cost to compete with the thermal power faction. Despite this, the hydropower faction cannot yet completely defeat the thermal power faction, because the thermal power faction can establish bases everywhere, with low construction costs and short construction times; the hydropower faction can only open bases on rivers, with high construction costs and long construction times, often making it a case of distant water not quenching immediate thirst. The tidal power faction (tidal power generation), allied with the hydropower faction, is vying for territory with the thermal power faction along the coast. From a developmental perspective, the hydropower faction, based on the continuous flow of water, and the tidal power faction, backed by the cyclical ebb and flow of tides, will eventually defeat the thermal power faction, based on mineral fuels.

    The once prominent atomic power faction (atomic energy generation), although capable of generating huge amounts of energy from small amounts of raw materials and is very popular, cannot fully support the atomic power faction within the electric power kingdom because the atomic energy released from small amounts of radioactive materials needs to be used directly in agriculture and medical fields, in large-scale transformations of nature such as moving mountains and overturning seas, in lighting and raising temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctic circles during half-year-long nights in the future; in melting alpine glaciers to open up water sources and overcome drought; in melting ice layers in the Arctic Ocean and around Antarctica to open up waterways; and to power space rockets to meet the increasingly busy interstellar travel in the future.

    The wind power faction (wind power generation) is a new force that cannot be ignored in the electric power kingdom. Its sphere of influence can span the globe, with the wind power of the entire Earth equivalent to three thousand times the energy of coal burned annually worldwide.

    The solar power faction (solar power generation) is uniquely favored, with the solar power faction's forces present in land, sea, plateaus, plains, forests, and deserts. Especially near the equator, in the Arctic and Antarctic circles, there are continuous days, continuously receiving solar heat energy for days or even nearly half a year. Currently, the power of the solar power faction in the electric power kingdom is not as active and valued as solar energy is in the agricultural world.

    The underground heat faction (geothermal power generation), which rarely showed its face in the past, is also a newly emerging powerhouse in the electric power kingdom, with its strength based on the ocean of magma boiling beneath our feet—the vast amount of heat energy stored inside the Earth. Its potential power is very strong, and it is still difficult for us to calculate its total energy. It is estimated that the heat released from the Earth in a hundred years is equal to the heat generated by all fuels on Earth. As for the heat that has not yet been released inside the Earth, there is even more. For example, the energy generated by an ordinary volcanic eruption is equivalent to the energy generated by thousands of large hydroelectric power stations. It is not difficult to imagine how enormous the power hidden deep underground is!

    Electricity is the main driving force for all modern production. Let us mobilize all forces within the electric power kingdom to meet the growing need for electricity in production and life, and let more electricity contribute all its strength to building a beautiful socialist and communist society.

    电力王国内幕
    卫杰文
    从十九世纪电力王国兴起以来，古老的蒸汽机王国逐渐衰落。新兴的电力王国几乎占领了所有现代生产领域以至生活领域。神通广大的电力是大力士，它可以变成机械运动力，带动机器，控制操作；可以发出光亮，用以照明；可以发热，是太阳的化身；可以发出声音，成为通讯兵的助手；可以引起化学作用，如电解铜、合成纤维，成为制造物质的魔术师……。电力不计路程远近，从几米到一千公里以外都可以输送；电力不计时间长短，从几分之几秒到几年都可以使用；电力不计用量大小，从几个瓩到几百万瓩都可以供应；电力传送迅速，每秒钟能走三十万公里。
    在电力王国内部不断进行着剧烈的斗争。首先是火力派（火力发电）和水力派（水力发电）之间的斗争。以煤、石油等矿物资源为后盾的火力派，由于资源的有限，加上化学工业越来越多地利用石油、煤等天然资源来制造各种合成物质，使它们直接为改善人们物质生活服务，因此，火力派的实力大大削弱。水力派依靠它天赋的无穷的巨大的水能和低廉的成本，跟火力派较量。尽管这样，水力派目前还不能完全战胜火力派，因为火力派到处可以建立根据地，造价低、建设时间短；水力派只能在江河上开辟根据地，造价高、建设时间长，往往远水救不了近火。跟水力派结盟的潮力派（潮力发电）在沿海跟火力派争夺地盘。从发展上看，以川流不息的水力为基础的水力派和以循环不已的潮汐涨落的力量为后盾的潮力派，将会战胜以矿物燃料为基础的火力派。
    显赫一时的原子派（原子能发电），虽然能以少量的原料发出巨大的能量，很受人欢迎，但是从少量的放射性物质中释放出来的原子能，不能全部支持电力王国中的原子派，因为它要直接用之农业、医疗方面，用在大规模改造自然的移山倒海方面，用在将来南北极圈内夜半年的照明和提高气温方面；用在融化高山冰川开辟水源，克服干旱方面；用在融化北冰洋和南极洲附近洋面的冰层，开辟航道；用来发动宇宙火箭以满足将来日益繁忙的星际航行等。
    风力派（风力发电）是电力王国里一支不可忽视的新生力量，它的势力范围可遍及全球，全地球的风力相当于全球每年所燃烧的煤的能量的三千倍。
    太阳能派（太阳能发电），得天独厚，不论是陆地、海洋、高原、平原、森林、沙漠都有太阳派的势力。尤其是赤道附近，在南北极圈里有连续的白昼，几天以至近半年的长时期内不断接受着太阳的热能。目前在电力王国里太阳派的力量，还没有像太阳能在农业世界里那样活跃和受人重视。
    过去很少露头角的地下热派（地下热能发电），也是电力王国里新生的实力派，它以在我们脚下沸腾着岩浆的海洋——蕴藏在地球内部的大量热能为实力。它的潜在力量是十分雄厚的，现在我们还很难计算出它的全部能量，据估计地球上一百年内放出的热量，就等于全地球所有燃料所发出的热量，至于地球内部还没有放出的热量，就更多了。例如一次普通火山爆发所产生的能量，相当于几千个大型水力发电站所产生的能量那么大，不难想像出地下深处蕴藏着的力量该是多么巨大！
    电力是一切现代化生产的主要动力来源，让我们调动电力王国内部一切力量，来满足生产上、生活上对电力日益增长的需要，让更多的电力为建设美好的社会主义、共产主义贡献出全部力量。
