    Mongolian Sukhbaatar City
    Newly Built Factories Put Into Production
    (Xinhua News Agency, Sukhbaatar) The first pulp and paper mill and a prefabricated wooden structure factory built by Mongolia in Sukhbaatar City were officially handed over and put into production on the 5th.
    These two newly built enterprises, together with the thermal power plant completed at the end of last year, have become a new industrial zone in Sukhbaatar City. The paper mill can produce 3,500 tons of various types of paper annually. The prefabricated wooden structure factory is attached with a plywood manufacturing factory, with an annual output of 20,000 square meters of house components, which can be used to build 100 wooden houses of 30 square meters; in addition, it also produces 10,000 cubic meters of flooring and 45,000 square meters of doors and windows.
    These two factories were constructed with China's free assistance to Mongolia under the 1956 Sino-Mongolian agreement on China's provision of economic and technical assistance to Mongolia. The factories officially started construction in April last year and were completed successively in June and August this year. After trial production, they proved to meet the design requirements.

    蒙古苏赫巴托尔市
    新建两厂投入生产
    据新华社苏赫巴托尔电　蒙古在苏赫巴托尔市兴建的第一座纸浆造纸厂和一座木结构房屋预制厂5日正式移交投入生产。
    这两个新建企业和去年底完工的热电站连在一起，成为苏赫巴托尔市的一个新兴的工业区。造纸厂每年能生产各种纸张三千五百吨。木结构房屋预制厂附设一座胶合板制造厂，年产房屋构件两万平方米，可以用来建成三十平方米的木结构房屋一百座；另外还生产一万立方米的地板和四万五千平方米的门窗。
    这两个工厂是根据1956年中蒙关于中国给予蒙古经济和技术援助协定，由中国无偿地帮助蒙古建设的。工厂在去年4月正式施工，今年6月和8月先后建成，经过试车生产，证明符合设计要求。
