    China's Foreign Trade Over the Past Decade
    Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade

    Completely freed from the dependence of old China's foreign trade on imperialism, establishing an independent and autonomous foreign trade serving the interests of the broad masses of the Chinese people and the socialist cause.

    Over the past decade, based on the great victories achieved in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and with the continuous rise of China's national economy and the extensive development of foreign relations, China's foreign trade has also made tremendous achievements, becoming a completely independent, autonomous, and socialist foreign trade.

    For more than a century before liberation, due to the continuous aggression of imperialism, China gradually became a colony and semi-colony, serving as a market for the sale of industrial products and a place for the plundering of industrial raw materials by imperialist countries. Relying on their military and economic advantages, the imperialists imposed various unequal treaties on the Chinese people, seized many privileges in China, and forced China to open many so-called treaty ports as strongholds for plundering the wealth of the Chinese people. They also seized control of China's customs administration, held the key to China's gate, and manipulated China's foreign trade. At that time, China's foreign trade was entirely a tool serving the interests of imperialism and the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, playing only a role of serious obstruction and destruction to the national economy. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, this situation has completely changed. From the day of the founding of the country, while thoroughly destroying all the privileges of imperialism in China, we regained the autonomy of customs administration, holding the key to China's gate in the hands of the Chinese people themselves. We completely freed ourselves from the dependence of old China's foreign trade on imperialism, establishing an independent and autonomous foreign trade serving the interests of the broad masses of the Chinese people and the socialist cause.

    At the beginning of the founding of the country, the socialist state-owned foreign trade was already in a leading position in China's foreign trade field, and soon occupied an absolute advantage in terms of operating proportion. With the victorious progress of China's socialist revolution, China's private import and export merchants, like other private industrial and commercial enterprises, implemented joint state-private ownership across the entire industry in 1956, basically completing socialist transformation.

    In order to ensure the absolute leadership of the people's democratic regime in foreign trade and consolidate the independence and autonomy of foreign trade, China has consistently pursued a policy of state control and trade protection. According to this policy, a series of measures have been implemented, including classified management of import and export commodities, import and export licensing system, protective tariffs, prohibition of smuggling, foreign exchange control, inspection and control of the quality of import and export commodities, registration management of private import and export merchants, and management of foreign businesses. These measures have effectively resisted the economic aggression of imperialism, protected the development of China's industrial and agricultural production, ensured that foreign trade activities are carried out completely in accordance with established guidelines and policies and plans, and facilitated the state's utilization, restriction, and transformation of private import and export merchants. In trade with various fraternal countries, these measures have played a role in strengthening economic cooperation between each other in a planned way.

    China's foreign trade has consistently followed the general line and various economic policies of the Party and the state, organizing the exchange of materials between domestic and foreign in a planned way.

    Since the founding of the country, China's foreign trade has consistently followed the general line and various economic policies of the Party and the state, organizing the exchange of materials between domestic and foreign in a planned way, serving China's industrial and agricultural production and socialist construction.

    Since the founding of the country, we have resolutely implemented the policy of self-reliance as the primary focus and striving for foreign assistance as a supplement in foreign trade. In order to gradually build our country, with its large population, vast land, backward economy, and abundant resource potential, into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, we must mainly rely on our own human, material, and financial resources, fully utilize the wisdom and strength of the people across the country, practice diligence and thrift, and work hard; at the same time, under the premise of self-reliance, strive for appropriate assistance from fraternal countries according to needs and possibilities. This assistance is an important and favorable condition for the relatively high-speed development of China's socialist construction. Under the guidance of the above policy, actively doing a good job in striving for foreign assistance is a major task of China's foreign trade. In accordance with this policy, we have consistently implemented the principle of seeking truth from facts and acting according to our capabilities in foreign trade work, not acting solely on our own subjective wishes.

    Because we have resolutely implemented the above policy, the development of China's foreign trade over the past decade has been adapted to the development of the entire national economy. On the basis of the rapid recovery and development of China's national economy, China's import and export volume has grown considerably. The total import and export volume in 1958 increased by approximately twofold compared to 1950. Foreign exchange revenue and expenditure have always been balanced, fundamentally changing the situation of long-term import surplus and serious deficit in old China. In the total import volume over the years, means of production have consistently accounted for the vast majority. For example, during the period from 1950 to 1958, means of production accounted for more than 90% of China's imported materials. The means of production imported by China over the years mainly include various modern industrial complete sets of equipment, various machine tools and other machinery, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, automobiles, locomotives, precision instruments, telecommunications equipment, petroleum and its products, chemical raw materials, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and other materials. These materials have powerfully promoted the recovery and development of China's industrial and agricultural production, supported the great leap forward of China's national economy since 1958, and accelerated the process of China's socialist industrialization. In addition to these important means of production, a portion of daily necessities for the people's lives are also imported, such as sugar, paper, medicines, medical equipment, cotton cloth, medicinal materials, kerosene, and other materials, as well as certain raw materials and materials necessary for domestic light industrial production, such as rubber, wool tops, cotton, dyes, rayon, iron sheets, and chemical raw materials. These materials also play a certain role in meeting the needs of the domestic market and improving the lives of the Chinese people.

    With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the structure of China's export commodities has also undergone significant changes over the past decade. In the past, the vast majority of exports were agricultural and sideline products and their processed products. In recent years, the export of industrial and mineral products has gradually increased. For example, in 1952, industrial and mineral products accounted for 18% of China's export trade volume, rising to 28% by 1957. Now, some materials that China could not produce in the past or mainly relied on imports to supply domestic needs, such as certain machinery and equipment and general machine tools, several chemical raw materials, as well as bicycles and sewing machines, not only no longer need to be imported, but can also export a portion to meet foreign needs.

    Since the founding of the country, we have consistently implemented the principle of overall planning and appropriate arrangements in the arrangement of export materials, maintaining an appropriate ratio between domestic and foreign sales, so that on the one hand, we can ensure the supply of major products to the domestic market, and on the other hand, we can organize exports according to needs and possibilities in order to exchange for necessary imported materials. The proportion of China's total export commodity value in the total output value of industry and agriculture has generally been around 4%, basically adapting to the requirements of national economic development. This not only takes into account the immediate interests of the Chinese people, but also takes into account the long-term interests of the Chinese people.

    In the first half of this year, due to the rapid growth of people's purchasing power, the supply of a small portion of non-staple foods and a few daily necessities temporarily could not keep up, and some people suspected that this was due to excessive exports. This is not in line with the facts. As for the malicious slander by the imperialist reactionaries that China is implementing "hunger exports," that is even more unable to withstand the test of facts.

    China has consistently adhered to the establishment and development of commercial and trade relations with countries around the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, enabling China's foreign trade relations to greatly develop.

    Since the founding of the country, China has consistently adhered to the policy of establishing and developing commercial and trade relations with countries around the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. China's constitution clearly stipulates: "In international affairs, China's unwavering policy is to strive for the noble goals of world peace and human progress." According to this fundamental policy, China has consistently actively consolidated and developed friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation with the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, and has also consistently actively consolidated and developed friendly relations with nationalist countries and other peace-loving countries, adhering to peaceful coexistence with all countries, regardless of their social systems. Our socialist system has incomparable superiority, and we are not afraid to conduct peaceful competition with capitalism, and we firmly believe that we will achieve the final victory in peaceful competition. Carrying out equal and mutually beneficial international trade exchanges is conducive to strengthening the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist fraternal countries, and is also conducive to promoting peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Therefore, for the past decade, China has consistently adhered to the establishment and development of commercial and trade relations with countries around the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, enabling China's foreign trade relations to greatly develop. To date, China has established trade relations with ninety-three countries and regions, and has signed intergovernmental trade treaties or agreements with twenty-seven of them.

    With a spirit of combining patriotism and internationalism, and based on actual needs and possibilities, planned development of China's trade relations with socialist countries, conducting close mutual assistance and cooperation and mutual support, in order to promote the common rise of their respective economies.

    China's trade relations with fraternal countries in the socialist camp are an important aspect of the new type of socialist international relations, and are an important form for socialist fraternal countries to implement economic cooperation and mutual support. For the past decade, China has consistently followed the principles of active collaboration, equality and mutual benefit, and seeking truth from facts, with a spirit of combining patriotism and internationalism, and based on actual needs and possibilities, planned development of China's trade relations with socialist fraternal countries, conducting close mutual assistance and cooperation and mutual support, in order to promote the common rise of their respective economies. In trade exchanges, each tries to meet the needs of the other as much as possible, regarding helping other fraternal countries as their bounden duty. Since 1950, China has signed trade agreements with fraternal countries in the socialist camp every year, or signed commodity exchange protocols in accordance with the already signed trade agreements; and has signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with the Soviet Union, and has signed or is negotiating the signing of long-term trade agreements with many fraternal countries in the socialist camp.

    China's trade with fraternal countries in the socialist camp is the most solid and reliable foundation for the development of China's foreign trade, and is the main part of China's foreign trade. With the rapid development of the economies of socialist countries and the increasing consolidation and strengthening of mutual unity and cooperation, China's trade relations with various fraternal countries are constantly developing vigorously. In 1958, China's trade volume with fraternal countries in the socialist camp increased by more than fivefold compared to 1950. Over the past decade, the trade volume with socialist countries has accounted for approximately 75% of China's total foreign trade volume.

    Through foreign trade, China has received tremendous support from fraternal countries in the socialist camp, especially from the Soviet Union. The materials imported by China from various fraternal countries are entirely materials necessary for China's economic construction and people's lives, the vast majority of which are machinery and equipment and various important equipment and raw materials necessary for industrial and agricultural production construction, scientific and technological research, and transportation industries. During the first five-year plan period, of the one hundred and sixty-six major engineering enterprises assisted by the Soviet Union in China's construction, one hundred and thirteen had been fully or partially completed and put into production by the end of 1958. The scale of these enterprises is large, and the technology is advanced and first-class. They are important projects for industrial construction during China's first five-year plan period. In 1958 and 1959, China and the Soviet Union signed two agreements on the Soviet Union helping China build and expand forty-seven enterprises and seventy-eight enterprises. These one hundred and twenty-five construction projects are all important industrial sectors necessary for China to further develop its national economy. Their completion will further enhance the strength of China's modern industry.

    The fraternal countries of Eastern Europe have also provided China with many important industrial complete sets of equipment and valuable technical assistance, using their most advanced and sophisticated technology to help China carry out construction. During the first five-year plan period, fraternal countries such as the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria helped China build sixty-eight industrial and mining enterprise projects, many of which have been completed and put into production. This has also played an active role in improving the level of China's modernized industrial production and accelerating the speed of China's economic construction.

    In addition to the above-mentioned complete sets of equipment, China has also imported important materials needed for China's industrial and agricultural production construction from the Soviet Union and Eastern European fraternal countries, mainly including: various machine tools, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, generators, diesel engines, heavy-duty automobiles, locomotives, mining equipment, drilling equipment, precision instruments, telecommunications equipment and equipment, petroleum and its products, chemical raw materials, tractors and other agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and fine seeds. Asian fraternal countries have also supplied China with some important materials needed for production construction, such as ore, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, chemical raw materials, draft horses, and timber. In the total import volume from fraternal countries in the socialist camp from 1950 to 1958, materials used for production construction (including complete sets of equipment) accounted for approximately 95%, and the remainder were materials directly used for consumption.

    In order to support the economic construction of fraternal countries in the socialist camp, we have also planned to organize the export of many materials, trying to meet the needs of various fraternal countries as much as possible. For the past decade, China's exports to various fraternal countries have mainly been agricultural and sideline products and their processed products, such as rice, soybeans, wheat, wool, hides, pig bristles, frozen meat, fruits, egg products, tea, silk, and handicrafts. In addition, some industrial and mineral products have also been exported, such as tungsten ore, molybdenum ore, mercury, pig iron, and caustic soda. In recent years, China has also supplied small and medium-sized complete sets of equipment to Asian fraternal countries, such as textile, match, paper, enamel, glass, brick and tile, rice milling, cultural and educational supplies factories, as well as some machinery, industrial equipment, woodworking tools, construction equipment, transportation equipment, and communications equipment. The export of these materials is of positive significance for promoting the development of the national economy and improving the living standards of various fraternal countries.

    In addition to trade, China and fraternal countries in the socialist camp have also conducted extensive and close cooperation in economic assistance, loans, science and technology, and transportation.

    Over the past decade, China's trade relations with Asian and African countries and regions have also greatly developed. To date, China has established trade and economic ties with fifty-four Asian and African countries and regions, and has successively signed intergovernmental trade agreements with countries such as Ceylon, Indonesia, Burma, India, the United Arab Republic, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, and Iraq. In 1958, China's trade volume with Asian and African nationalist countries increased by 1.8 times compared to 1950. The commodities exported by China to Asian and African countries and regions include necessities for people's lives that they need, as well as equipment and raw materials such as machinery, instruments, steel, pig iron, chemical raw materials, cement, and coal needed for their production construction. At the same time, we have also supplied some Asian and African countries with some complete sets of equipment necessary for them to develop their national industries within the scope of the other party's willingness and our capacity, such as textile factories, paper mills, plywood factories, cement plants, and potassium chlorate plants. The types of commodities imported by China from Asian and African countries and regions are also increasing day by day, with the main imported commodities being cotton, rubber, jute, coconut meat, coconut oil, medicines, and sugar. The import and export of these materials are beneficial to promoting the economic development of both sides and meeting the needs of people's lives.

    In trade exchanges with Asian and African countries, resolutely implement the policy of equality and mutual benefit and mutual exchange of goods, and conscientiously carry out trade exchanges according to the needs and possibilities of both sides. At the same time, provide economic and technical assistance to some Asian and African countries to help these countries develop independent and autonomous national economies.

    In China's trade exchanges with Asian and African countries, we have consistently resolutely implemented the policy of equality and mutual benefit and mutual exchange of goods, strictly respecting the needs and wishes of the other party, and conscientiously carrying out trade exchanges according to the needs and possibilities of both sides, never forcing the other party to accept commodities they do not need, or forcing the other party to sell commodities they do not want to sell, and never attaching any unequal special conditions that harm the other party's sovereignty and economic interests. In order to help some friendly countries solve their urgent needs for imports and exports, we have adjusted a portion of important materials from within the country to support these friendly countries, and have purchased a portion of materials that they felt were difficult to sell at the time. We have also implemented a trade policy of having imports and exports and balancing imports and exports with Asian and African countries, and have adopted a method of using the other country's currency to record accounts and make payments with some countries in order to facilitate external payments by both sides, give play to the trade potential of both sides, and develop mutual exchange of goods and trade exchanges. The prices of import and export commodities in China's trade with Asian and African countries are basically determined through consultation between both sides based on the level of capitalist international market prices, so that they are fair and reasonable and beneficial to both sides.

    Over the past decade, China has provided some economic and technical assistance to Asian and African countries such as Nepal, Yemen, Indonesia, and Ceylon to help these countries develop independent and autonomous national economies. Because China's economic strength is still weak and the level of production technology is not high, the economic and technical assistance we can provide to foreign countries is still very limited. However, the assistance we provide does not carry any political privileges or conditions, and the aid funds and loans are completely independently controlled by the other party, and we do not supervise or interfere in the slightest; the experts and technicians we send only have the obligation to provide suggestions to the other country and help the other party's work, and do not demand any privileges; the materials we provide in accordance with aid or loans all meet the actual needs of the other party, and the vast majority are means of production such as machinery and equipment needed by the other party to develop its national industry. These situations fully demonstrate that China's economic and technical assistance to Asian and African countries is entirely based on the sincere desire to actively support Asian and African countries to develop independent economies.

    The historical facts of the past decade powerfully prove that the development of trade and economic cooperation between China and Asian and African countries is fully in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit, is conducive to Asian and African countries developing independent national economies on the basis of self-reliance, and is conducive to enhancing friendly cooperative relations between Asian and African countries and the cause of world peace. The peaceful foreign trade policy of equality and mutual benefit and mutual exchange of goods implemented by China has had a good impact in Asian and African countries and regions, and is increasingly valued and welcomed by the governments and peoples of Asian and African countries.

    Under the influence of China's peaceful foreign trade policy of equality and mutual benefit, coupled with the efforts of the broad masses of the people and business circles in Western countries, China's trade with Western countries has also developed to some extent.

    Over the past decade, China has consistently established and developed trade relations with Western countries in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit. However, some Western countries have followed US imperialism in imposing an "embargo" on China since 1950; after the "embargo" clearly suffered a defeat, they have continued to implement various discriminatory measures to restrict China's exports to these countries. This will inevitably lead to China correspondingly reducing imports from these countries; the result is only that their foreign markets are further reduced, and commodity sales are increasingly difficult. For us, these measures fundamentally cannot hinder the victorious progress of China's economic construction and the development of foreign trade. On the contrary, they promote our self-reliance to build our country faster. Therefore, these trade discrimination measures have been increasingly strongly opposed by peace-loving countries and the broad masses of the people, and are becoming increasingly unpopular even within Western countries. Under the influence of China's peaceful foreign trade policy of equality and mutual benefit, coupled with the efforts of the broad masses of the people and business circles in Western countries, China's trade with Western countries has still developed to some extent in recent years. To date, China has successively signed intergovernmental trade agreements with countries such as Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway; the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and China's state-owned foreign trade specialized companies have also successively signed non-governmental trade agreements or contracts with industrial and commercial enterprises or groups in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, and Italy. In the future, we will continue to conduct trade exchanges with Western countries in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit. However, it should be pointed out that all international trade exchanges can only develop normally in a friendly political atmosphere. It is obviously unrealistic for some Western countries to adopt a discriminatory attitude towards China politically or economically and want to develop trade with us. Some Western countries even think that we have no choice but to do business with them, and thus still vainly attempt to make a profit in trade with China, which is even more wrong.

    Over the past decade, China's trade relations with Latin American countries have also recovered and developed to a certain extent. The friendly contacts between China and non-governmental organizations and business circles in some Latin American countries have also increased day by day. China's trade with Latin American countries has the potential for development. In recent years, the calls from the broad masses of the people and business circles in Latin America to establish and develop trade relations with China have been increasing day by day, and we have consistently given active support and warm welcome to this desire. We are willing to work together with the people of various Latin American countries to develop mutually beneficial trade relations on an equal footing.

    China's great achievements in peaceful foreign trade are part of the great victory of the Party and the state's general line, peaceful diplomatic policy, and peaceful economic policy.

    The achievements of China's foreign trade over the past decade vividly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and fully prove the consistency of China's socialist peaceful foreign trade with the interests of the people of all countries in the world and the cause of world peace. The imperialist reactionaries who were driven out by the Chinese people once asserted that the Chinese people would not be able to run the economy. US imperialism also coerced other countries to follow it in imposing an "embargo" on China, vainly attempting to strangle China's economy and undermine China's socialist cause. These conspiracies have all been thoroughly bankrupted. China's great achievements in peaceful foreign trade are part of the great victory of the Party and the state's general line and peaceful diplomatic policy and peaceful economic policy, and are the result of the broad masses of the people across the country working hard, struggling arduously, and actively supporting foreign trade work on various production and construction fronts. At the same time, this is also inseparable from the friendly cooperation and active support of the Soviet Union and other socialist fraternal countries. We have not only received friendly cooperation and support from the Soviet Union and other socialist fraternal countries in foreign trade activities, but have also learned from the experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries in foreign trade work, combining it with China's actual situation. In the future, we will continue to resolutely obey the leadership of the Party, rely on the strong support of the people across the country, and on the basis of the achievements and experience gained in foreign trade work over the past decade, under the premise of correctly implementing the Party and the state's general line and various guidelines and policies of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, in accordance with the resolutions and instructions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, oppose rightism, encourage enthusiasm, and launch an in-depth campaign to increase production and practice economy in the national foreign trade system, cooperate with the great leap forward of the national economy, further improve the level of foreign trade work, and better complete foreign trade tasks. We will continue to actively strive to consolidate and strengthen the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation with the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, to develop trade exchanges with Asian and African nationalist countries and Latin American countries, as well as all peace-loving countries, so that China's foreign trade can better serve China's socialist cause, and continue to play its active role in the cause of world peace and human progress.

    十年来我国的对外贸易
    对外贸易部部长　叶季壮
    彻底摆脱了旧中国对外贸易对帝国主义的依附，建立了独立自主的、为我国广大人民利益和社会主义事业服务的对外贸易
    十年来，在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得伟大胜利的基础上，随着我国国民经济的不断高涨和对外关系的广泛开展，我国对外贸易也取得了巨大的成就，并且成为完全独立自主的、社会主义性质的对外贸易。
    在解放以前一百多年中，由于帝国主义的不断侵略，我国逐步沦为殖民地、半殖民地，成为帝国主义国家工业产品的销售市场和工业原料的掠夺对象。帝国主义者凭借着军事和经济上的优势，把各种不平等条约强加在中国人民的身上，在我国攫取了许多特权，并且强迫我国开放许多所谓通商口岸，作为他们掠夺中国人民财富的据点。他们还夺取了我国海关管理权，掌握了我国大门的钥匙，操纵了我国的对外贸易。那时候，我国的对外贸易完全是为帝国主义及官僚买办资产阶级的利益服务的工具，对国民经济只是起着严重的阻碍和破坏作用。自从中华人民共和国成立以后，这种情况就完全改变了。从建国之日起，我们在彻底摧毁帝国主义在我国的种种特权的同时，收回了海关管理的自主权，将中国大门的钥匙掌握在中国人民自己的手里。我们彻底摆脱了旧中国对外贸易对帝国主义的依附，建立了独立自主的、为我国广大人民利益和社会主义事业服务的对外贸易。
    在建国开始时，社会主义性质的国营对外贸易在我国对外贸易领域中，就已处于领导地位，不久就在经营比重上占着绝对优势。随着我国社会主义革命的胜利进行，我国私营进出口商，如同其他私营工商业一样，在1956年实行了全行业公私合营，基本上完成了社会主义改造。
    为了确保人民民主政权在对外贸易方面的绝对领导，巩固对外贸易的独立自主，我国一贯执行国家管制和保护贸易的政策。根据这个政策，实行了进出口商品分类管理、进出口许可证制度、保护关税、查禁走私、外汇管理、进出口商品品质的检验和管制，私营进出口商登记管理和外商管理等一系列的措施。这些措施有效地抵制了帝国主义的经济侵袭，保护了我国工农业生产的发展，保证了对外贸易活动完全按照既定的方针政策和计划来进行，而且便于国家对私营进出口商进行利用、限制和改造。在对各兄弟国家的贸易中，这些措施起了有计划地加强彼此间经济合作的作用。
    我国对外贸易一贯遵循党和国家的总路线和各项经济政策，有计划地组织内外物资交流
    建国以来，我国对外贸易一贯遵循党和国家的总路线和各项经济政策，有计划地组织内外物资交流，为我国工农业生产和社会主义建设事业服务。
    建国以来，我们在对外贸易中坚决贯彻了自力更生为主、争取外援为辅的方针。为了把我们这样一个人口众多、土地辽阔、经济落后而资源潜力又很丰富的国家，逐步地建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，必须主要依靠本国的人力、物力和财力，充分发挥全国人民的智慧和力量，克勤克俭，艰苦奋斗；同时，在以自力更生为主的前提下，根据需要和可能，从兄弟国家争取适当的援助。这种援助，是我国的社会主义建设事业能够以比较高的速度向前发展的重要的有利条件。在上述方针指导下，积极做好争取外援的工作，就是我国对外贸易的一项主要任务。按照这个方针，我们在对外贸易工作中一贯贯彻执行实事求是、量力而行的原则，不是单凭自己的主观愿望办事。
    由于我们坚决执行了上述方针，十年来我国对外贸易的发展同整个国民经济的发展是相适应的。在我国国民经济迅速恢复和发展的基础上，我国对外贸易的进出口额有了相当的增长。1958年进出口总额比1950年约增长了二倍。对外收支一直是平衡的，根本改变了旧中国长期入超和严重逆差的情况。在历年进口总额中，生产资料一直占着绝大的比重。例如，在1950年到1958年期间，我国进口物资中，生产资料就占九成以上。我国历年进口的生产资料，主要是各种现代化的工业成套设备、各种机床和其他机械、黑色金属、有色金属、汽车、机车、精密仪器、电讯器材、石油及其产品、化工原料、化学肥料、农药等物资。这些物资有力地促进了我国工农业生产的恢复和发展，支援了1958年以来我国国民经济的大跃进，加速了我国社会主义工业化的进程。除了这些重要的生产资料外，还进口了一部分人民生活日用必需品，如砂糖、纸张、药品、医疗器材、棉布、药材、煤油等物资以及国内轻工业生产所必需的某些原料和材料，例如橡胶、毛条、棉花、染料、人造丝、铁皮和化工原料等。这些物资对供应国内市场的需要和改善我国人民的生活，也有一定的作用。
    随着工农业生产的发展，十年来我国出口商品的结构也有了显著的变化。过去出口的绝大部分是农副产品及其加工品。近年来工矿产品的出口逐渐增多。例如，在1952年我国出口贸易额中，工矿产品占18％，到1957年已经上升到28％。现在，有些过去我国不能生产或者主要依靠进口来供应国内需要的物资，如某些机器设备和一般机床、若干化工原料以及自行车、缝衣机等，不仅不再需要进口，而且还可以出口一部分供应国外需要了。
    建国以来，我们在出口物资的安排上，一贯地贯彻执行统筹兼顾和适当安排的原则，使内外销保持适当的比例，一方面能够保证主要产品对国内市场的供应，另一方面又能按照需要和可能组织出口，以便换回必要的进口物资。我国历年出口商品总值在工农业总产值中所占的比重，一般都在4％左右，基本上是适应国民经济发展的要求的，这样不仅照顾到我国人民的眼前利益，而且照顾到我国人民的长远利益。
    今年上半年，由于人民购买力增长很快，有一小部分副食品和少数日用品供应一时跟不上去，有人怀疑是因为出口多了，这是不合乎事实的。至于帝国主义反动派恶意地污蔑我国实行“饥饿出口”，那是更经不起事实的对证的。
    我国一贯坚持在平等互利的基础上，同世界各国建立和发展通商贸易关系，使我国对外贸易关系有了很大发展
    建国以来，我国一贯坚持执行在平等互利的基础上同世界各国建立和发展通商贸易关系的政策。我国宪法明确规定：“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力”。根据这个根本方针，我国一贯积极地巩固和发展同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的友好团结和互助合作，同时也一贯积极地巩固和发展同民族主义国家及其他爱好和平的国家的友好关系，坚持同一切国家和平共处，而不问其社会制度如何。我们的社会主义制度有着无比的优越性，我们不怕同资本主义进行和平竞赛，并且深信在和平竞赛中我们必将得到最后的胜利。而开展平等互利的国际贸易往来，是有利于加强社会主义各兄弟国家间的友好团结和互助合作的，也是有利于促进不同社会制度国家和平共处的。因此，十年来我国一贯坚持在平等互利的基础上，同世界各国建立和发展通商贸易关系，使我国对外贸易关系有了很大的发展。到目前为止，我国已经同九十三个国家和地区建立了贸易关系，并且同其中二十七个国家签订了政府间贸易条约或协定。
    以爱国主义和国际主义相结合的精神，根据实际需要和可能，有计划地发展我国同社会主义国家的贸易关系，进行紧密的互助合作和相互支援，以促进各自经济的共同高涨
    我国同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的贸易关系，是新型的社会主义国际关系的一个重要方面，是社会主义各兄弟国家间实行经济合作和互相支援的重要形式。十年来，我国一贯按照积极协作、平等互利、实事求是的方针，以爱国主义和国际主义相结合的精神，根据实际需要与可能，有计划地发展我国同社会主义各兄弟国家的贸易关系，进行紧密的互助合作和相互支援，以促进各自经济的共同高涨。在贸易往来中，彼此都尽可能地满足对方的需要，把帮助其他兄弟国家作为自己应尽的义务。自1950年以来，我国同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家每年都签订了贸易协定，或者按照已经签订的贸易协定签订商品交换议定书；并且同苏联签订了中苏通商航海条约，同社会主义阵营许多兄弟国家分别签订了或者正在商谈签订长期贸易协定。
    我国同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的贸易，是我国对外贸易发展的最巩固、最可靠的基础，是我国对外贸易中的主要部分。随着社会主义各国经济的迅速发展和相互间的团结合作的日益巩固和加强，我国同各兄弟国家的贸易关系不断蓬勃地发展着。1958年我国同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的贸易额比1950年增长了五倍多。十年来，对社会主义国家的贸易额在我国对外贸易总额中约占75％。
    通过对外贸易，我国从社会主义阵营各兄弟国家，特别是从苏联，得到了巨大的支援。我国从各兄弟国家进口的物资，完全是我国经济建设和人民生活所必需的物资，其中绝大部分是工农业生产建设、科学技术研究事业和交通运输业所必需的机器设备和各种重要器材和原料。在第一个五年计划期间，苏联帮助我国建设的一百六十六项重大工程企业，到1958年底止，已经有一百一十三项全部建成或部分建成，投入生产。这些企业的规模都是宏大的，技术都是先进的和头等的。它们是我国第一个五年计划期间工业建设的重要项目。在1958年和1959年，中苏两国又签订了关于苏联帮助中国建设和扩建四十七项企业和七十八项企业的两个协定。这一百二十五个建设项目都是我国进一步发展国民经济所必需的重要工业部门，它们的建成，将进一步增强我国现代工业的力量。
    东欧各兄弟国家对我国也提供了许多重要的工业成套设备和宝贵的技术援助，用它们的最先进、最精湛的技术来帮助我国进行建设。在第一个五年计划期间，德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚等兄弟国家帮助我国建设了六十八个工矿企业项目，其中有许多项目已经建成和投入生产。这对于提高我国现代化工业生产的水平，加快我国经济建设的速度，也起了积极的作用。
    除了上述成套设备外，我国还从苏联和东欧兄弟国家进口了我国工农业生产建设所需要的重要物资，主要有：各种机床、黑色金属、有色金属、发电机、柴油机、载重汽车、机车、矿山设备、钻探设备、精密仪器、电讯器材和设备、石油及其产品、化工原料、拖拉机及其他农业机械、化学肥料、优良种籽等。亚洲各兄弟国家也供应了我国生产建设所需要的一些重要物资，如矿砂、黑色金属、有色金属、化工原料、耕马、木材等。在1950年至1958年我国从社会主义阵营各兄弟国家进口总额中，用于生产建设的物资（包括成套设备）占95％左右，其余是直接用于消费的物资。
    为了支援社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的经济建设，我们也有计划地组织了许多物资出口，尽可能满足各兄弟国家的需要。十年来，我国对各兄弟国家出口的主要是农副产品及其加工品，如大米、大豆、小麦、羊毛、皮张、猪鬃、冻肉、水果、蛋品、茶业、丝绸、手工艺品等。此外，还出口了一些工矿产品，如钨砂、钼砂、水银、生铁、烧碱等。近年来，我国对亚洲各兄弟国家还供应了中小型的成套设备，如纺织、火柴、造纸、搪瓷、玻璃、砖瓦、碾米、文教用品等工厂以及一些机器、工业器材、木工工具、建筑器材、交通运输器材和通讯器材等。这些物资的出口，对于促进各兄弟国家国民经济的发展和人民生活水平的提高，是有积极意义的。
    除了贸易以外，我国同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家还在经济援助、贷款、科学技术和交通运输等方面进行了广泛而密切的合作。
    十年来，我国同亚非国家和地区的贸易关系也有了很大的发展。到目前为止，我国已经同五十四个亚非国家和地区建立了贸易和经济联系，并且先后同锡兰、印度尼西亚、缅甸、印度、阿联、柬埔寨、阿富汗、也门、突尼斯、摩洛哥、伊拉克等国家签订了政府间贸易协定。1958年我国对亚非民族主义国家的贸易额比1950年增长了一点八倍。我国对亚非国家和地区出口的商品，有它们所需要的人民生活必需品，也有它们进行生产建设所需要的机器、仪器、钢材、生铁、化工原料、水泥、煤炭等器材和原料。同时，我们还在对方愿意和我方力所能及的范围内，向一些亚非国家供应了它们发展民族工业所必需的一些成套设备，例如纺织厂、造纸厂、胶合板厂、水泥厂、氯酸钾厂等。我国从亚非国家和地区进口商品的种类也日益增多，主要的进口商品有棉花、橡胶、黄麻、椰干、椰油、药品、砂糖等。这些物资的进口和出口，对于促进双方经济的发展和供应人民生活的需要，都是有利的。
    在对亚非国家的贸易来往中，坚决执行平等互利和互通有无的政策，切实按照双方的需要和可能来进行。同时，对部分亚非国家提供了经济、技术援助，帮助这些国家发展独立自主的民族经济
    我国在对亚非国家的贸易往来中，一贯坚决执行平等互利和互通有无的政策，严格尊重对方的需要和愿望，切实按照双方的需要和可能来进行，从不强迫对方接受他们所不需要的商品，或者强迫对方出售他们所不愿出售的商品，也从不附加任何不平等的特殊条件，损害对方的主权和经济利益。为了帮助一些友好国家解决他们对进口和出口的急需，我们曾经从国内调剂出一部分重要物资支援这些友好国家，并曾向一些友好国家购买了一部分当时他们感到销售困难的物资。我们对亚非国家还贯彻了有进有出、进出平衡的贸易方针，并且对有些国家采取了用对方国家货币记账支付的方式，以利于双方对外支付，发挥双方的贸易潜力和发展互通有无的贸易往来。我国同亚非国家贸易的进出口商品价格基本上是根据资本主义国际市场价格水平，经过双方协商确定的，使其公平合理，对双方都有利。
    十年来，我国尼泊尔、也门、印度尼西亚、锡兰等亚非国家提供了一些经济、技术援助，帮助这些国家发展独立自主的民族经济。由于我国经济力量还很薄弱，生产技术水平还不高，因此，我们对外所能提供的经济和技术援助还十分有限。但是，我们所提供的援助不附带任何政治特权和条件，援款和贷款完全由对方自主地支配，我们丝毫不加以监督和干涉；我国派出的专家和技术人员只有向对方国家提供建议和帮助对方工作的义务，而不要求任何特权；我们按照援助或贷款所提供的物资，都是符合对方实际需要的，而且绝大部分是对方发展民族工业所需要的机器设备等生产资料。这些情况充分表明：我国对亚非国家提供的经济和技术援助，完全是基于积极支持亚非国家发展独立经济的真诚愿望。
    十年来的历史事实有力地证明：我国同亚非国家间的贸易和经济合作的发展，是完全符合和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神的，是有利于亚非各国在自力更生的基础上发展独立的国民经济的，有利于增进亚非各国之间的友好合作关系和世界和平事业的。我国所执行的平等互利和互通有无的和平对外贸易政策，在亚非国家和地区已经发生良好的影响，并且日益受到亚非国家政府和人民的重视和欢迎。
    在我国平等互利的和平对外贸易政策的影响下，加上西方国家广大人民和工商界人士的努力，我国同西方国家的贸易也有所发展
    十年来，我国一贯按照平等互利的原则，同西方国家建立和发展贸易关系。但是，某些西方国家自1950年以来就追随美帝国主义对我国实行“禁运”；在“禁运”明显地遭到失败之后，又不断实行各种歧视措施，来限制我国对这些国家的输出。这就必然导致我国相应地减少从这些国家的进口；其结果只是使他们的国外市场更加缩小，商品销售日益困难。对我们来说，这些措施根本阻碍不了我国经济建设的胜利进行和对外贸易的发展，相反地，还促进我们自力更生来更快地建设自己的国家。因此，这些贸易歧视措施已经遭到爱好和平的国家和广大人民日益强烈的反对，就是在西方国家内部也愈来愈不得人心。在我国的平等互利的和平对外贸易政策的影响下，加上西方国家广大人民和工商界人士的努力，近年来我国同西方国家的贸易仍然有所发展。到目前为止，我国已先后同芬兰、瑞典、丹麦、挪威等国家签订了政府间贸易协定；中国国际贸易促进委员会和我国国营外贸专业公司也曾先后同英国、法国、西德、荷兰、瑞士、奥地利、比利时，意大利等国家的工商企业或团体签订过民间性贸易协议或合同。今后，我们将继续按照平等互利的原则同西方国家进行贸易往来。但是，应当指出，一切国际贸易往来，只有在友好的政治气氛下，才有可能得到正常的发展。某些西方国家在政治上或经济上对我国采取歧视态度，而又想同我们发展贸易，这种想法显然是不现实的。有的西方国家甚至以为我们非同它们做生意不可，因而还妄想在同我国的贸易中捞一把，那更是大错特错了。
    十年来，我国对拉丁美洲国家的贸易关系也有一定程度的恢复和发展。我国同拉丁美洲一些国家的民间团体和工商界人士的友好接触也日益增多。我国同拉丁美洲各国的贸易，是具有发展的可能的。近年来，拉丁美洲广大人民和工商界人士要求同我国建立和发展贸易关系的呼声日益增高，我们对这种愿望一贯给以积极支持和热烈欢迎，我们愿意和拉丁美洲各国人民共同为发展相互之间的平等互利的贸易关系而努力。
    我国和平对外贸易的巨大成就，是党和国家的总路线、和平外交政策、和平经济政策的伟大胜利的一部分
    十年来我国对外贸易的成就，生动地显示了社会主义制度的优越性，充分证明我国社会主义的和平对外贸易与世界各国人民利益和世界和平事业利益的一致性。被中国人民赶走了的帝国主义反动派曾经断言中国人民不会办经济，美帝国主义还胁迫其他国家追随它对我国实行“禁运”，妄想扼杀我国的经济，破坏我国的社会主义事业，这些阴谋都已经彻底地破产了。我国和平对外贸易的巨大成就，是党和国家的总路线与和平外交政策及和平经济政策的伟大胜利的一部分，是全国广大人民在各个生产建设战线上鼓足干劲、艰苦奋斗、积极支持外贸工作的结果。同时，这同苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家对我国的友好合作和积极支援也是分不开的。我们不仅在对外贸易活动上得到苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的友好合作和支援，而且结合我国实际情况，学习了苏联和其他兄弟国家的对外贸易工作的经验。今后我们将继续坚决服从党的领导，依靠全国人民的大力支持，在十年来对外贸易工作成就和取得的经验的基础上，在正确贯彻执行党和国家的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和各项方针政策的前提下，根据八中全会的决议和指示，反右倾，鼓干劲，在全国外贸系统中深入开展增产节约运动，配合国民经济大跃进，进一步提高对外贸易工作的水平，更好地完成对外贸易任务。我们将继续积极地为巩固和增强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的友好团结和互助合作，为发展同亚非民族主义国家和拉丁美洲国家以及一切爱好和平的国家的贸易往来而努力，使我国对外贸易更好地为我国的社会主义事业服务，并且在世界和平和人类进步事业中继续发挥其积极作用。
