Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 5th: Over 20,000 basic construction workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, inspired by the great call of the Party Central Committee, have decided to take all measures to shorten the construction period of this year's key construction projects in the steel capital by one to two months. This is to ensure that Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfills this year's steel production target and contributes to the nation's overfulfillment of the 12 million tons of steel production target.

Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction scale this year is still very large, with a total of thirty-four new and continued projects. These projects are all being built to enhance Anshan Iron and Steel's production capacity in raw materials, fuel, power, heat, transportation facilities, etc. Among them, thirty projects will be partially or fully completed and put into production this year. After these projects are put into production, Anshan Iron and Steel's iron ore output can be increased by 16%, artificial rich ore output by 4.4%, and coke output by 7%.

When the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached Anshan Iron and Steel, the builders here were in high spirits. The next morning, a solemn oath-taking rally was held, immediately setting off a massive competition for speed, quality, and low cost. They are doing everything possible to overcome difficulties, tap potential, widely mobilize all positive factors, and vigorously accelerate the construction period. They are determined to shorten the construction period of the first phase of the Gongchangling Concentrator, the Dong Anshan Filtration Workshop, the No. 1 Rotary Kiln of the Dashiqiao Magnesite Brick Factory, the Gongchangling Coking Project, the Shoushan Water Source Water Pipeline, the Steelmaking Plant Ingot Crane, the Rolling Mill Waste Heat Boiler, and the 12 Gas Booster Station Pipeline by one to two months respectively compared with the original plan. These projects are to be completed and put into production ahead of schedule by the end of September, adding fresh troops to the steel front to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the workers of all ethnic groups are in high spirits and fighting overnight to get the No. 1 Blast Furnace to produce iron early, as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    鞍钢建设者立下大志  重点工程将提前建成
    新华社鞍山5日电　鞍山钢铁公司两万多基本建设职工，在党中央的伟大号召鼓舞下，决定采取一切措施，把钢都今年重点建设工程的工期缩短一个月到两个月，以确保鞍钢超额完成今年钢铁生产任务，为全国超额完成一千二百万吨钢的生产任务贡献自己的力量。
    鞍钢今年的基本建设规模仍然很大，全部新建续建工程共计三十四项。这些项目，都是为增强鞍钢的原料、燃料、动力、热力、运输设施等方面的生产能力而建设的，其中有三十项工程将在今年内部分或全部建成投入生产。这些工程投入生产之后，鞍钢铁矿石产量可以提高16％，人造富矿产量提高4.4％，焦炭产量提高7％。
    当党的八届八中全会公报和决议传到鞍钢的时候，这里的建设者们情绪高昂。第二天一早就举行了庄严的誓师大会，立即掀起声势浩大的快速、优质、低成本竞赛。他们千方百计地克服困难，挖掘潜力，广泛地调动一切积极因素，大力加快建设工期，立志要将弓长岭选矿厂的一期工程，东鞍山过滤车间，大石桥镁砖厂一号回转窑，弓长岭焦化工程，首山水源地输水管道，炼钢厂铸锭吊车，轧钢厂余热锅炉，一二瓦斯加压站管道等工程，分别比原计划缩短一个月到两个月的工期，提前在9月底建成并投入生产，为钢铁战线增添生力军，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。（附图片）
