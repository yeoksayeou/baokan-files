Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch　Wang Shikang, a young technician from the Third Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, through bold experimentation, created a major new technology for converter steelmaking: non-stop blowing charging. After the application of this new technology on the six 6-ton converters in the first workshop of this steelmaking plant, steel production can be increased by 15,000 tons from now until the end of the year.

Each heat of steelmaking in a converter requires 700 to 800 kilograms of lime, and manual charging takes 10 to 15 minutes. In the past, air blowing had to be stopped during charging. Therefore, each time the material was added, the furnace temperature dropped by 150 to 200 degrees. This not only prolonged smelting time but also lowered the temperature of the molten steel, affecting the quality of the steel and increasing the consumption of lime and ferroalloy. For a long time, this issue has been a key problem for the Third Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in improving steel production and quality. When the young technician Wang Shikang initially proposed experimenting with non-stop blowing charging and using machinery to replace manual charging, he was opposed by a few people with conservative ideas. They said, "With such a strong wind, and such small lime particles, if you add materials without stopping the wind, won't it all be blown away?" However, Wang Shikang was not discouraged. Through repeated experiments, it was proven that lime particles larger than 20 millimeters could be added without stopping the wind, and such a large particle size also met the technical requirements of steelmaking. The factory Party committee promptly encouraged and supported him in further experiments, helping him to make storage cylinders, chutes, supports, and other equipment used for non-stop blowing charging. Originally, Wang Shikang's designed charging chute was fixed, and slag easily adhered to it during charging. Han Shengzhang, the deputy leader of the No. 4 furnace team, suggested changing the fixed chute to an extendable and retractable movable chute. Jiao Fengxian, Wang Fuguan of the youth furnace, and Tian Guoren, the leader of the No. 3 furnace team, also helped him with the experiment. Thus, after two months, the experiment was finally successful. Adopting the new method can shorten the smelting time by 15 to 25 minutes per heat of steel. The labor productivity of charging workers can be increased by more than 30%. Fifteen kilograms of lime can be saved per heat of steel. The labor intensity of workers is greatly reduced. The quality of the steel is improved, and it is also beneficial for prolonging the life of the furnace lining.

Currently, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company is promoting this new technology throughout the factory. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has decided to award Wang Shikang the honorary title of "Socialist Construction Youth Leap Forward Shock Worker" and commended the young workers who participated in the experiment: Han Shengzhang, Jiao Fengxian, Wang Fuguan, Tian Guoren, and others.

    转炉炼钢的一项重大技术革新
    王诗康试验不停风加料成功
    每炼一炉钢的时间可缩短十五至二十五分钟
    新华社太原电　太原钢铁公司第三炼钢厂青年技术员王诗康，经过大胆试验，创造了转炉炼钢不停风加料法的重大新技术。这一新技术在这个炼钢厂第一车间的六座六吨转炉上运用后，由现在到年底可以增产一万五千吨钢。
    转炉每炼一炉钢，需要七百公斤到八百公斤石灰，用人工加料要十分钟到十五分钟。过去加料时要停风。因此每加一次料，炉温要降低一百五十度到二百度。这样不但延长冶炼时间，而且降低钢水温度，影响钢的质量，石灰和合金铁的消耗量也要增加。长期以来，这个问题成为太原钢铁公司第三炼钢厂提高钢的产量质量的关键问题。青年技术员王诗康在开始提出试验不停风加料和利用机械代替人工加料的时候，曾受到少数有保守思想的人反对。他们说：那么大的风，石灰粒又那么小，要不停风加料，还不全给吹光了。但是，王诗康并不气馁。经过一次又一次的试验，证明在不停风的情况下，粒度二十个毫米以上的石灰都可以加进去，同时这样大的粒度也合乎炼钢的技术要求。工厂党委及时鼓励和支持他作进一步的试验，帮助他制作了不停风加料所用的储料缸滑槽、支架等设备。原来王诗康设计的加料滑槽是固定的，加料时渣子容易粘结，四号炉副组长韩圣章就提出由固定槽改为可以伸缩的活动槽的建议，青年炉的焦凤仙、王富官和三号炉的田国仁等三个组长也帮助他试验。这样，经过两个月的时间终于试验成功了。采用新的方法，每炼一炉钢的冶炼时间可以缩短十五分钟到二十五分钟。加料工人的劳动生产率可以提高30％以上。每炼一炉钢可以节约十五公斤石灰。工人的劳动强度大为减轻。钢的质量改善了，对于延长炉衬寿命也有好处。
    目前，太原钢铁公司正在全厂推广这项新技术。共青团太原市委决定授予王诗康“社会主义建设青年跃进突击手”的光荣称号，同时表扬了参与试验的青年工人韩圣章、焦凤仙、王富官、田国仁等。
