Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 23rd: The Presidium of the World Peace Council issued an appeal on the 22nd, advocating that a summit meeting be held without delay.

    The appeal welcomes the mutual visits of the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States, welcomes the progress in negotiations on the cessation of nuclear testing, welcomes the agreement of the four major powers to establish a disarmament commission on a basis of reciprocity, and the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward by the Soviet government at the United Nations General Assembly.

    The appeal emphasizes that, however, the problems remaining to be solved are complex. The atmosphere of mistrust that poisons the world has not yet been eliminated, and there are still forces opposing the end of tension. The struggle is not over, and efforts must be made to win victory. In order to provide the best possible opportunity for negotiations and exchange of views, a summit meeting must be held without delay.

    The appeal points out that public opinion has facilitated the meetings of politicians. Public opinion will also prompt them to reach agreements. The appeal emphasizes that making war impossible is no longer a dream, but a responsibility of governments and a task of the people of all countries. Today, this is something that the people of all countries can achieve.

    世界和平理事会发出呼吁
    必须毫不迟延举行最高级会议
    新华社布拉格23日电　世界和平理事会主席团在22日发表的一份呼吁书中主张毫不迟延地举行最高级会议。
    呼吁书欢迎苏美两国政府首脑的相互访问，欢迎关于停止核试验的谈判的进展，欢迎四大国就在对等的基础上建立裁军委员会达成协议，以及苏联政府在联合国大会上提出的全面和彻底的裁军的建议。
    呼吁书强调说，但是，尚待解决的问题是复杂的。毒化全世界的不信任气氛尚未消除，还有一些势力在反对结束紧张局势。斗争尚未结束，还要作出努力才能赢得胜利。为了尽可能替谈判和交换意见提供最好的机会，必须毫不迟延地举行最高级会议。
    呼吁书指出，公众舆论促成了政治家们的会晤。公众舆论也将促使他们进而达成协议。呼吁书强调说，使战争成为不可能，现在已经不再是梦想，而是各国政府的职责，是各国人民的任务。今天，这是各国人民所能做到的事。
