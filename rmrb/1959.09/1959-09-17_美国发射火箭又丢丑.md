    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: New York dispatch: At 11:45 AM international standard time on the 16th, the United States launched a "Jupiter" rocket carrying small animals from Cape Canaveral, Florida. However, the rocket exploded in the air ten seconds after liftoff.
    The rocket carried fourteen pregnant mice, two frogs, fruit fly larvae, onions, human blood, and human skin, among other experimental materials, to test the possible effects of space flight on them. The rocket was scheduled to reach an altitude of 300 miles and land in an area of the Atlantic Ocean after flying 1,500 miles. Planes and ships were already waiting in that area to retrieve the rocket before it was launched.
    However, immediately after liftoff, the rocket deviated from its course, swaying from left to right as it ascended. A moment later, the rocket emitted large plumes of flame and caught fire, exploding ten seconds after liftoff. The fragments of the rocket and the remains of all its "passengers" were scattered across the launch site. Fortunately, no personnel were injured. According to the British "Daily Mirror," "The United States originally wanted to launch the rocket a few hours before Khrushchev arrived in the United States in order to gain some recognition after the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket successfully reached the moon."

    美国发射火箭又丢丑
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：16日国际标准时间十一点四十五分，美国在佛罗里达的卡纳维拉尔角发射了一个带有小动物的“丘辟特”火箭，但是，火箭在起飞后十秒钟就在空中爆炸了。
    这个火箭中带有十四只已经怀孕的老鼠、两只青蛙、果蝇幼虫、洋葱、人血和人的皮肤等试验物，准备试验宇宙飞行可能对它们产生的影响。预定这个火箭将达到三百哩的高度，并在飞完一千五百哩后落在大西洋的一个地区。火箭发射前，早已有飞机和船只在那个地区等待捡收这个火箭。
    然而，火箭刚一发出即偏离轨道，左摇右摆地向上钻去，一会儿，火箭喷出了大团的火焰，并在起飞后十秒钟时，起火爆炸。火箭和它携带的全部“乘客”的碎尸残骸纷纷散落在火箭起飞的发射场上。幸好场上人员没有伤亡。据英国“每日镜报”报道，“美国原想在赫鲁晓夫到达美国以前的几小时内，发射火箭，以便在苏联的宇宙火箭成功地到达月亮之后，也争出一点风头。”（附图片）
