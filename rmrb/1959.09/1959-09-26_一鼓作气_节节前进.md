\tHenan to Complete Annual Coal Production Plan Twenty Days Ahead of Schedule
\tFushun West Open-pit Mine Increases Coal Production by Another 116,000 Tons
\tFuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine Exceeds Third Quarter Plan

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 24th: Henan Province's coal mine workers' production increase and economy drive are surging higher and higher, with coal production increasing every ten-day period. Taking the average daily output in early August as 100, it was 122 in mid-August, 138 in late August, 146 in early September, and 169 in mid-September. The average daily coal output in mid-September has increased from 55,000 tons in July to 89,000 tons. At present, Pingdingshan, Yima, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Xuchang, Luoyang and other regions or key coal mines have completed the third quarter coal production plans ahead of schedule. It is estimated that the province's third quarter coal production plan can be greatly overfulfilled.

In order to produce more coal to meet the needs of winter production and life, the Henan Provincial Coal Industry Department called on coal mine workers throughout the province to apply the experience and enthusiasm of August and September to the next phase of work, press on with sustained efforts, and work hard in October and the fourth quarter to ensure the completion of the annual coal production plan twenty days ahead of schedule. All mines are required to seize the opportunity during the National Day holiday to do a good job in equipment maintenance and other production preparations, and strive for the production level in early October to exceed that of late September. At the same time, take advantage of the period before and after National Day when railway transportation has fewer other transportation tasks, and transport coal to various coal-using production units in advance. The workers of all mines responded to the call of the coal industry department and challenged each other. The workers of Jiaozuo Coal Mine put forward a proposal to the coal mine workers of the province to work hard in October and the fourth quarter. The workers of Hebi Coal Mine put forward the battle slogan of "Working hard for ninety days, seizing 830,000 tons of coal," guaranteeing to increase the production of raw coal by 100,000 tons for the state.

After studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the coal mine workers in Henan Province quickly launched a magnificent upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. Not only did coal production rise linearly, and costs fall, but also the ash content of coal was lower than in the past, and the tunneling speed and basic construction workload were greatly improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, September 24th: After completing the third quarter national plan twelve days ahead of schedule, the workers of Fushun West Open-pit Mine pressed on with sustained efforts and advanced victoriously, and on the 24th, they completed the third quarter production increase plan of 116,000 tons of coal ahead of schedule as a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

Fushun West Open-pit Mine, which has won successive victories, proposed the goal of completing the production increase plan six days ahead of schedule in order to make more outstanding achievements as a gift to National Day. Immediately afterwards, a dragon-style competition was launched among the three main processes of open-pit mining (loading, hauling, and unloading), and advanced electric shovel drivers and electric locomotive drivers were organized to perform technical demonstrations, thereby improving the technical level of all drivers. After the efficiency of electric shovel loading was greatly improved, the electric locomotive drivers also followed suit by hauling more and running faster, resulting in a continuous increase in high-yield electric shovels and high-yield electric locomotives. The number of electric shovels that reached the large-area high-yield indicators stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry in the last six days increased from seventeen in the first eighteen days to twenty-seven.

Now, all the workers of the mine are seizing the last few days of this month, preparing to increase coal production for the country by another 153,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, September 24th: The workers of Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine presented the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with excellent production achievements: completing the third quarter coal production plan seven days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by 4,960 tons.

Since entering August, this mine has opposed right-leaning tendencies and inspired enthusiasm. While focusing on coal mining, it has also focused on stripping, tunneling, and mechanical maintenance, increasing the amount of recoverable coal and promoting the continuous rise of coal production levels. In August, Fuxin area had fourteen days of heavy rain, causing the largest rain damage to this open-pit coal mine since liberation. Under the leadership of the Party committee, all the workers of the mine fought bravely in the rain, ensuring that light rain did not affect production and heavy rain had less impact on production, overcame the rain damage, and still overfulfilled the production plan.

After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published in late August, all the workers of the mine widely launched counterpart competitions, opponent competitions, and performance competitions. Management cadres also formed professional groups, went deep into the site, discovered problems, and solved problems. Therefore, the output of the entire mine rose steadily, achieving a good start, a red day, and a red ten-day period in September. At present, all the workers of the mine are continuing to work hard, striving to increase coal production for the country by another 180,000 tons by the end of this month.

    一鼓作气　节节前进
    河南要提前二十天完成全年产煤计划
    抚顺西露天矿又增产十一万六千吨煤
    阜新海州露天矿超额完成三季度计划
    新华社郑州24日电　河南省煤矿职工增产节约运动一浪高过一浪，煤炭产量一旬高过一旬。如以8月上旬平均日产量为一百，8月中旬为一百二十二，8月下旬为一百三十八，9月上旬为一百四十六，9月中旬为一百六十九。9月中旬煤的平均日产量已由7月份平均日产五万五千吨提高到八万九千吨。目前，平顶山、义马、郑州、新乡、许昌、洛阳等地区或重点煤矿都已提前完成第三季度产煤计划，预计全省第三季度的煤炭生产计划可以大大超额完成。
    为了生产更多的煤炭，满足冬季生产和生活的需要，河南省煤炭工业部门号召全省煤矿职工，把8、9月份的经验和干劲，用到下一段工作中去，一鼓作气，大干10月份和第四季度，保证提前二十天完成全年的煤炭生产计划。要求各矿抓紧在国庆节休假期间作好设备预修工作和其他生产准备工作，力争10月上旬的生产水平超过9月下旬。同时利用国庆节前后铁路运输上其他运输任务较少的时期，把煤炭提前运到各个用煤的生产单位。各矿职工纷纷响应煤炭工业部门号召，互相挑战应战。焦作煤矿的职工向全省煤矿职工提出大干10月份和第四季度的倡议书，鹤壁煤矿职工提出：“大干九十天、夺煤八十三万吨”的战斗口号，保证为国家增产原煤十万吨。
    河南省煤矿职工学习党的八届八中全会决议以后，很快地掀起了波澜壮阔的增产节约高潮。不仅煤炭产量直线上升，成本下降，而且煤的灰分比过去降低，掘进速度和基本建设工作量都大大提高。
    新华社抚顺24日电　抚顺西露天矿职工继提前十二天完成第三季度国家计划之后，一鼓作气乘胜前进，又在24日提前超额完成了第三季度增产十一万六千吨煤炭向建国十周年献礼的计划。
    连战连捷的抚顺西露天矿，为做出更出色的成就向国庆节献礼，在提前完成第三季度计划的当天，又提出提前六天完成增产计划的奋斗目标。紧接着，露天采煤的三道主要工序（装车、拉车、翻车）之间，又展开一条龙大竞赛，组织先进的电铲司机、电机车司机进行技术表演，从而提高了全体司机们的技术水平。在电铲装车效率大大提高之后，电机车司机们，也跟着多拉、快跑，因而高产电铲、高产电机车不断增加。最近六天达到煤炭工业部规定的大面积丰产指标的电铲，由头十八天的十七台增产到二十七台。
    现在，全矿职工正在抓紧本月的最后几天，准备再为国家增产煤炭十五万三千吨。
    新华社阜新24日电　阜新海州露天矿职工以优异的生产成绩向建国十周年献礼：提前七天，超额四千九百六十吨完成了第三季度煤炭生产计划。
    这个矿从进入8月以来，反右倾、鼓干劲，在抓采煤的同时，大抓剥离、掘进、机械检修等工作，增加可采获得煤量，推动煤炭生产水平不断上升。阜新地区在8月份，先后下了十四天大雨，使这个露天煤矿的生产受到解放以来最大一次雨害。全矿职工在党委领导下，冒雨奋战，做到小雨不影响生产、大雨少影响生产，战胜雨害，仍然超额完成了生产计划。
    8月下旬，党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，全矿职工广泛展开了对口赛、对手赛、表演赛，管理干部也组成专业小组，深入现场，发现问题。解决问题。因此，全矿产量节节上升，在9月份做到了开门红、日日红、旬旬红。目前全矿职工正在继续苦战，力争在本月末再给国家增产十八万吨煤炭。
