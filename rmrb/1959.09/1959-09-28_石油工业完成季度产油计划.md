Xinhua News Agency, September 27th. The national petroleum industry workers today completed the third quarter crude oil production plan three days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by 1.1%; in the first twenty days of September, the crude oil production level increased by 23.5% compared with the same period in August, and on the 23rd, a record high for the national daily crude oil production was created. Now, the workers are determined to advance victoriously, fight hard in the fourth quarter, and redouble their efforts to overfulfill the annual national production plan.

After the Communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, the vast number of workers in the petroleum industry system opposed right-leaning ideas, boosted their energy, and quickly pushed the increase production and practice economy campaign to a new high. In August, the national crude oil production plan was overfulfilled by 2.5%, and the crude oil output increased by 18.14% compared with July. At the beginning of September, the Yumen, Xinjiang, Qinghai and other petroleum administrations all convened workers' conferences of several thousand or even tens of thousands of people to summarize the experience of carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign in August, to evaluate and reward advanced units and advanced workers, and to take measures to solve some key problems in production that had not been solved in the past, so as to further improve the production level. For example, in the past, the capacity of the oil pipeline from Karamay to Dushanzi in Xinjiang could not keep up with the needs of crude oil production, which affected the increase in crude oil production. After hard work day and night by the workers, an auxiliary oil pipeline was built in early September, and now the average daily oil transmission is about 18% higher than in the past. This has better utilized the production potential of crude oil. The workers of the first integrated oil production zone of Ya'erxia Oil Mine in Yumen, in mid-September, classified all pumping wells according to oil well output, pressure, oil-gas ratio, and water content ratio, and strictly implemented the "five fixed" measures of fixed time, fixed pressure, fixed well, fixed shift, and fixed quantity to ensure oil production from every well, and the average daily output in mid-September increased by 80% compared with the beginning of the month.

Well teams, groups, and sections also universally carried out competition and cooperation. In the competition, the workers greatly promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. After creating a deep well drilling speed record of 451 meters per day, the advanced 32137 well team of Yumen Petroleum Administration sent their best driller to help their competitor, the 3280 team, so that they quickly created a record of 452 meters per day. They became an advanced well team.

    石油工业完成季度产油计划
    新华社27日讯　全国石油工业职工今天提前三天超额1.1％完成了第三季度原油生产计划；9月头二十天原油生产水平比8月同期增长了23.5％，并在23日创造了全国原油日产量的最高纪录。现在，职工们决心乘胜前进，大战第四季度，为超额完成全年国家生产计划加倍努力。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，石油工业系统的广大职工，反右倾，鼓干劲，迅速把增产节约运动推向了新的高潮。8月份超额2.5％完成了国家原油生产计划，原油产量比7月份增长了18.14％。9月初，玉门、新疆、青海等石油管理局都召开了几千人以至于成万人的职工大会，总结8月份开展增产节约运动的经验，评选奖励先进单位与先进职工，并且采取措施解决了生产中一些过去没有解决的关键问题，使生产水平进一步提高。例如新疆克拉玛依到独山子的输油管的能力过去赶不上原油生产的需要，影响原油产量的提高，经过职工日夜苦战，在9月上旬修成了一条输油副管，现在平均每天输送的原油比过去每天提高18％左右。这样就更好地发挥了原油的生产潜力。玉门油矿鸭儿峡综合采油第一区队的职工们，在9月中旬根据油井产量、压力、油气比、含水比，把全部抽油井进行分类排队，严格执行定时、定压、定井、定班、定量的“五定”措施，保证井井出油，中旬平均日产量较月初提高80％。
    各井队、班组、科室还普遍开展对手赛，协作赛。竞赛中，职工们大大发扬共产主义协作精神。玉门石油管理局先进的三二一三七井队在创造日进四百五十一米的深井钻速纪录以后，抽出自己最好的司钻去帮助竞赛对手三二八○队，使他们很快也创造了日进四百五十二米的纪录。成为先进井队。
