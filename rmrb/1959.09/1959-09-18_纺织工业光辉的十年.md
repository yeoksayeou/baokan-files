Glorious Decade of the Textile Industry
Jiang Guangnai, Minister of Textile Industry

Our people are greeting the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland with boundless joy. Over the past ten years, in the rapid development of our national economy, the textile industry, which supplies the people's clothing needs, has also achieved rapid development. Now, it is an independent industrial sector that can guarantee the warmth of 650 million people, and can completely solve domestic problems in terms of raw materials, equipment, and production.

Although the textile industry in old China was more developed than other industries, from the appearance of the first modern cotton textile enterprise in 1890 to the eve of liberation in 1949, a total of only five million cotton spindles were built in sixty years. A large part of these were established by imperialists to exploit our country's raw materials and cheap labor for predatory production. Although national capital had a certain degree of development, it was often in a precarious situation and living on borrowed time under the exclusion of imperialist and bureaucratic capital. Our country originally had good natural conditions for producing textile raw materials such as cotton, wool, hemp, and silk, but under the dual oppression and exploitation of reactionary rulers at home and abroad, the vast rural areas were bankrupted, and raw materials could not even be self-sufficient. From 1946 to 1949, half of the cotton used by yarn factories across the country relied on imports from capitalist countries. The textile machinery industry was even more unable to develop, and almost all equipment depended on imports from capitalist countries. Factories were abnormally concentrated in a few coastal cities, far away from the vast raw material producing areas and consumer markets. Shanghai alone concentrated 47% of old China's cotton textile equipment and 73.5% of its wool textile equipment. Production technology in enterprises was backward, management was extremely corrupt, the abuse of workers was very cruel, and production efficiency was extremely low. In sixty years, the highest annual output of cotton yarn was only 2.45 million bales, and cotton cloth was only 2.79 billion meters. Adding in the large amount of imported cotton cloth and the peasant's own spun and woven homespun cloth, the national average per capita consumption of cotton cloth was only a little over five meters. In 1949, when the country was liberated, cotton yarn production further dropped to 1.8 million bales, and cotton cloth production dropped to 1.89 billion meters. The national average per capita consumption of cotton cloth was only about three meters, of which the rural population only had about two meters (calculated based on a population of over 470 million). In fact, at that time, many working people could not even get rid of the threat of hunger, and very few could afford to buy new clothes.

The establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 completely overthrew the criminal rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary group, and later achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, opening up infinitely broad prospects for the high-speed development of the textile industry. Now, only ten short years after the founding of the new China, our country's textile industry has already experienced an extremely glorious development process. During the period of national economic recovery from 1950 to 1952, our country's textile industry was rapidly restored and developed. In 1952, cotton yarn production reached 3.62 million bales, double the amount in 1949, exceeding the highest annual output in history by 48%. In 1953, our country began to implement the large-scale First Five-Year Plan for economic construction. On the one hand, the textile industry further tapped the potential of existing enterprises, and at the same time, built a large number of new factories in the vast raw material producing areas, which greatly increased the production capacity of the textile industry. In 1957, cotton yarn production reached 4.65 million bales, an increase of 28% compared with 1952. Cotton cloth increased by 32%. The wool, hemp, and silk textile industries have also greatly developed.

In 1958, illuminated by the party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, our country's textile industry, like other sectors, entered an unprecedented period of the Great Leap Forward. In that year, the production of cotton yarn reached 6.1 million bales, an increase of 31% compared with 1957. That is to say, the annual growth rate was greater than the five-year growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period. Wool, hemp, and silk textiles also increased by about 40% compared with 1957, all greatly exceeding the average annual growth rate in the First Five-Year Plan.

This year, our country's textile industry, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, is continuing to leap forward at a faster pace. This year's cotton yarn production will reach 8.2 million bales, an increase of 34% compared with 1958. In this way, the target of producing 8 to 9 million bales of cotton yarn by 1962 can be victoriously completed three years ahead of schedule. Now, a magnificent new high tide of the increase production and practice economy movement has been vigorously launched on the national textile industry front. The broad masses of workers are high in morale, full of vigor, and full of infinite confidence in completing and overfulfilling this year's plan.

While the output of various types of textiles has increased rapidly, the quality of products has also greatly improved. Before liberation, the most that could be produced with domestic cotton was 42-count cotton yarn, but now it is possible to produce 150-count or higher cotton yarn. The output of woolen fabrics in old China was low, and the quality was poor, but now many varieties, such as fancy overcoating, high-grade gabardine, and women's tweed, have reached advanced levels in quality. The variety of designs and colors is even more diverse. In 1958 alone, more than 5,000 new varieties were trial-produced and produced, including not only a large number of popular products with novel designs and durability, but also many high-end products that were previously considered impossible to manufacture for a while, such as high-grade shrink-resistant poplin, electrostatic flocking fabrics, cashmere fabrics, colorful Xiangyun silk, and anti-pressure velvet. These high-quality textiles not only better meet the diverse needs and preferences of the domestic people, but also have been welcomed and praised abroad. Over the past ten years, we have also produced many industrial textiles that used to rely on imports, such as industrial felt, tire cord fabric, electrical insulation base fabric, and industrial screening silk, which have strongly supported the needs of national construction.

The rapid growth in the output of textiles and the increasing variety of designs and colors have greatly improved the clothing situation of our people. This year, the national average per capita consumption of cotton cloth will reach more than eight meters, more than double that of 1949, and more than double for the rural population. The average per capita consumption of other items such as knitwear, woolen yarn, woolen fabrics, and silk fabrics has also increased year by year. Compared with 1958 and 1952, woolen yarn increased by 2.7 times, knitwear increased by 1.5 times, and woolen fabrics and silk fabrics both increased by more than double.

Imperialists and their running dogs are currently doing their best to slander our country's construction achievements, especially the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and are doing their best to tout the so-called prosperity of capitalist countries, and maliciously slander that the rapid development of our national economy is achieved at the expense of lowering the people's living standards. Then let us compare it with the development speed of the textile industry that supplies the people's clothing needs. The United Kingdom, an old capitalist country that once dominated the textile industry, had 28% more cotton yarn production in 1949 than our country in the same year, while in 1958, it only had a quarter of our country's production in the same year. The United States is currently the country with the highest cotton yarn production in the world. From its textile cotton data, it took nearly twenty years to increase from producing more than 6 million bales of cotton yarn to more than 8 million bales. Although it once increased to more than 9 million bales, it has declined to more than 8 million bales in recent years. Our country can increase from 6.1 million bales to 8.2 million bales in just one year. Faced with this ironclad fact, what else can they clamor about? Their hysterical slander and vilification only exposes their inner fear, and cannot conceal the incomparably brilliant glory of our country's Great Leap Forward!

The fact that our country's textile industry can achieve such brilliant achievements is inseparable from the party's deep concern for the people's clothing needs. In the process of leading our people in socialist construction, the party has always adhered to the policy of actively developing agriculture and light industry on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. This ensures that the various sectors of our national economy develop in a coordinated, proportional, and high-speed manner, and also ensures that our people's lives are continuously improved on the basis of developing production. In 1958, the party further put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism and a set of policies of walking on two legs. A vigorous and large-scale mass movement was launched on the industrial front, which more fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to build socialism, and made the textile industry, like other sectors, appear in an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. The wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, Chairman Mao, and the increasingly high revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses are the most fundamental guarantees for our continuous victory.

The high-speed development of the textile industry has first received huge support from agriculture. Since liberation, under the leadership of the party, the broad masses of farmers have completely eliminated feudal landlord exploitation, relied on the huge superiority of agricultural cooperativization, and the encouragement of the state in terms of price policies and agricultural loans, as well as the material assistance of industry to agriculture. While vigorously increasing grain production, they have actively developed the production of cotton, wool, hemp, and silk, improved varieties, and enabled the supply of raw materials for the textile industry to quickly embark on the road of self-sufficiency. Compared with 1957 and 1949, cotton increased by about 2.7 times, jute increased by 8.5 times, and wool and silkworm cocoons also increased by more than double. In 1958, an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in production and the movement for people's communes appeared on the agricultural front, which made the actual harvest of cotton reach 42 million dan, a sharp increase of 28% compared with 1957, and several times more than the average annual increase of 4.7% during the First Five-Year Plan period. This greatly promoted the leap forward of the textile industry. This year, although our country encountered extraordinary floods and droughts, the production of grain and cotton will still have a large increase compared with the Great Leap Forward of 1958, thanks to the incomparable power of the new social organization of the people's commune. In the future, with the increasing consolidation and development of the people's communes and the increasing growth and strength of the chemical fiber industry, the supply of raw materials for the textile industry will become more and more abundant, which is an extremely powerful guarantee for the high-speed development of the textile industry.

Establishing our country's independent and self-reliant textile machinery industry and solving equipment problems through self-reliance is another important condition for rapidly developing the textile industry. In old China, there were nominally several textile machinery factories, but they were small in scale, had simple equipment, and were technologically backward, and in fact, most of them could only do some repair work. After liberation, in order to build our own textile machinery industry as soon as possible, the state expanded, rebuilt, and technically transformed some of the original textile machinery repair factories, added a large number of new equipment to make them textile machinery manufacturing factories with a certain scale; at the same time, it vigorously built new large-scale textile machinery factories with modern technical equipment. Within the country, according to a unified plan, it organized professional division of labor, collaborative coordination, so that each machinery factory could conduct specialized production according to its own expertise and technical experience, thereby rapidly expanding the production capacity of textile machinery, improving the technical level, and adapting to the needs of large-scale production. By 1958, our country had produced more than 3.8 million cotton spinning spindles and more than 90,000 looms. Wool, hemp, silk textile, and printing and dyeing equipment can also be manufactured by ourselves. All types of equipment have good quality and performance because they have widely absorbed advanced technical experience at home and abroad in design and manufacturing. They not only meet the needs of large-scale factory construction in the country, but also have exports.

Self-sufficiency in textile raw materials and equipment has provided a material basis for large-scale capital construction in our country's textile industry. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the state's investment in capital construction for the textile industry reached about 1.6 billion yuan, accounting for 6.4% of the total industrial investment in the country during the five years, and more than 70 new factories were built, including more than 40 cotton textile factories and more than 20 wool, hemp, and silk textile factories. Since 1958, under the guidance of the party's policy of developing both central and local industries, and developing both large and small and medium-sized enterprises, the capital construction of the textile industry has developed even more vigorously. A total of 118 capital construction projects were included in the national plan in 1958 and 1959. By 1958, the cotton spinning spindles that had been put into production in our country had increased by about 70% compared with 1949, wool spinning spindles had increased by 36.4%, and jute looms had increased by more than double. The centers of the cotton producing areas in the interior, such as Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, and Handan, have become emerging textile industry bases. Each base has a huge number of cotton textile equipment, and has built or is building corresponding printing and dyeing processing equipment, equipped with a complete textile machinery repair factory, and has established schools specializing in training textile professionals. Minority fraternal regions such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Guangxi also have or are building modern textile factories. These new factories and old factories complement each other, distributed in the vast majority of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, making our country's textile industry change the unreasonable phenomenon of being biased towards a few coastal cities in the past, and a new situation of scattered distribution and flourishing everywhere has emerged throughout the country.

While vigorously building new factories, giving full play to the potential of existing enterprises is another main aspect of developing the textile industry in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. In the textile industry, the original old factories still account for a large proportion of the country's equipment. Giving full play to their role is of great significance for increasing production, accumulating funds, cultivating talents, and supporting the construction of new factories. Since liberation, relying on the leadership of the party and the efforts of the broad masses of workers, the state has carried out a series of transformation work on the original old factories. The old bureaucratic capitalist enterprises were confiscated by the state when the country was first liberated and became the leading component of the national economy. Private textile enterprises, which accounted for more than 60% of the total output value of the national textile industry at the time of liberation, also fully realized joint state-private ownership in 1956 after socialist transformation. The numerous handicraft textile industries with a long history in our country have made proper arrangements in production according to the state's policy of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangements, and fully realized cooperativization in 1956. In enterprises, the party's leadership was strengthened, various old, reactionary, and corrupt management systems were abolished, and socialist enterprise management systems were established; the original extremely harsh working conditions were greatly improved; the maintenance and repair of equipment were strengthened, and necessary reconstruction, expansion, and technical transformation were carried out; various advanced technical operating experiences were continuously summarized and promoted, such as the Hao Jianxiu work method, the May 1 weaving work method, and the May 3 maintenance work method, which greatly improved the technical level of workers. The material and cultural life of the workers has also been greatly improved. The state-owned enterprises directly under the central government alone built 800,000 square meters of employee housing during the First Five-Year Plan period. Many workers who were originally illiterate have improved to the middle school level after several years of effort. The workforce has also greatly expanded. Compared with 1958 and 1949, the total number of employees has increased by more than double, and the number of engineering and technical personnel has increased by more than four times. A large number of outstanding workers have been promoted to take on administrative and technical leadership positions. All these measures have fundamentally changed the face of the original enterprises, greatly improved the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, and enabled the increase production and practice economy movement of enterprises to continuously develop, and the production potential has been greatly exerted. Taking the cotton textile industry as an example: Compared with 1957 and 1949, the equipment utilization rate increased by more than 20%, the national average output per thousand spindles per hour of medium-count cotton yarn increased from 18 kilograms to 25 kilograms, an increase of about 40%; the ability of fine yarn workers to tend spindles generally increased from 300 to 400 spindles per person to more than 800 spindles, and the average cotton consumption per bale of cotton yarn decreased from about 210 kilograms to about 193 kilograms. Especially since 1958, due to the great victory of the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, as well as the insistence on putting politics in command in enterprises and further implementing the mass line work method, the implementation of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" has made the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers unprecedentedly high. They have liberated their minds, broken superstitions, and launched a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, which has led to an unprecedented leap forward in production. For example, the unit output of the high-yield carding machine successfully researched in the cotton textile industry can be increased by about double; the hydrogen peroxide bleaching successfully researched in printing and dyeing can shorten the bleaching time from 20 to 30 hours to two or three hours, and can also save a lot of steam, water, electricity, and acids and alkalis, and improve labor productivity.

In our country's textile industry construction, the socialist brother countries, headed by the great Soviet Union, have given us great assistance. The Soviet government and people helped our country build the Harbin Flax Textile Factory with the latest equipment and superb technology, and also sent many excellent experts to our country to specifically guide the design of capital construction and machinery manufacturing, and helped us solve many important key production problems. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic provided new equipment for the first modern cotton textile factory in our country's capital, and helped our country build the Baoding Rayon Fiber Factory and the Beijing Synthetic Fiber Factory. Other fraternal countries have also given us selfless assistance. This noble spirit of internationalism and brotherly friendship will always be remembered in the hearts of our people.

Over the past ten years, the achievements of the new China's textile industry have been very great. It has transformed us from a country that imported cotton, cotton cloth, and textile equipment into a country that can be independent and self-reliant in the textile industry. This fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the great vitality of the new China. Of course, for a country with a population of more than 600 million, the production level of our country's existing textile industry is still relatively low. To fully meet the growing huge needs of the people in every aspect such as the quantity, quality, variety, and color of textiles, we must still under the leadership of the party, make arduous struggles and continue to develop the textile industry at high speed. However, since we have been able to achieve such brilliant victories as today on the basis of the backward textile industry in old China, we will certainly be able to continue to achieve new and greater victories under the brilliant banner of the party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune.

    纺织工业光辉的十年
    纺织工业部部长　蒋光鼐
    我国人民正怀着无限的欢乐迎接自己伟大的祖国建国十周年，十年来。在我国整个国民经济一日千里的发展过程中，供应人民衣着需要的纺织工业也获得了飞跃的发展。现在、它已经是一个能够保证六亿五千万人民穿暖，并且在原料、设备、生产方面国内已经完全能够解决的独立的工业部门了。
    旧中国的纺织工业虽然比其他工业发达一些，但从1890年出现第一个近代棉纺织企业起，到1949年解放前夕为止的六十年间，总共只建设了棉纺锭五百万枚，而且其中很大一部分是帝国主义为了利用我国的原料和廉价的劳动力进行掠夺性的生产而建立的。民族资本虽有一定的发展，但在帝国主义资本和官僚资本的排挤下，经常陷于风雨飘摇、朝不保夕的境地。我国本来有生产棉、毛、麻、丝等纺织原料的良好自然条件，但在国内外反动统治者的双重压迫和榨取下，广大农村陷于破产，原料反而不能自给。1946至1949年全国纱厂用棉有半数是靠从资本主义国家进口的。纺织机械工业更得不到发展，设备几乎全部依赖从资本主义国家进口。工厂畸形地集中在沿海少数城市，远离广大原料产地和消费市场。仅上海一地就集中了旧中国棉纺织设备的47％和毛纺织设备的73.5％。企业中生产技术落后，管理十分腐败，对工人的虐待非常残酷，生产效率极为低下。六十年间，棉纱的最高年产量只有二百四十五万件，棉布只有二十七点九亿米，加上当时大量进口的棉布和农民自纺自织的土布，全国人口平均每人的棉布消费量也只有五米多一些。1949年，全国解放的时候，棉纱产量更下降到一百八十万件，棉布产量下降到十八点九亿米，全国平均每人的棉布消费量只有三米左右，其中农村人口只有二米左右（按四亿七千多万人计算），事实上，当时许多劳动人民连饥饿的威胁都不能摆脱，能够添置衣服的更是寥寥无几了。
    1949年中华人民共和国建立，彻底推翻了帝国主义和国民党反动集团的罪恶统治，之后又取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，为纺织工业的高速度发展开辟了无比广阔的前途。现在新中国成立不过短短的十年，我国纺织工业已经经历了一个极其光辉的发展过程。在1950到1952年的国民经济恢复时期中，我国纺织工业就迅速地得到了恢复和发展。1952年棉纱产量达到三百六十二万件，比1949年增加了一倍，超过历史上最高年产量48％。1953年，我国开始执行大规模的第一个五年经济建设计划。纺织工业一方面进一步发挥原有企业潜力，同时在广大原料产地大量地建设新厂，使纺织工业的生产能力有了很大增长。1957年棉纱产量达到四百六十五万件，比1952年增长了28％。棉布增长了32％。毛麻丝纺织工业也都有很大发展。
    1958年，在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国纺织工业和其他部门一样，进入了一个史无前例的大跃进时期。这一年生产的棉纱达六百一十万件，比1957年增长了31％。也就是说，一年的增长速度比第一个五年计划期间五年的增长速度还要大。毛麻丝纺织品也都比1957年增加40％左右，都大大超过了第一个五年计划中每年平均增长的速度。
    今年我国的纺织工业又在1958年大跃进的基础上，快马加鞭，继续跃进。今年的棉纱产量将达到八百二十万件，比1958年增长34％。这样，到1962年生产棉纱八百到九百万件的指标，就可以提前三年胜利完成。现在，一个波澜壮阔的增产节约运动新高潮已在全国纺织工业战线上蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。广大职工斗志昂扬，意气风发，对完成和超额完成今年的计划，充满着无限的信心。
    在各类纺织品产量飞跃增长的同时，产品质量也大大提高了。解放前用国产棉花最多只能生产四十二支棉纱，现在可以生产一百五十支以上的棉纱。旧中国的毛织品产量低，质量低劣，而现在生产的许多品种，如拷花大衣呢、高级华达呢、女色花呢等，质量都达到了先进的水平。花色品种更是百花齐放，万紫千红。仅1958年试制和生产的新品种就达五千多种，其中不仅有大量花色新颖和坚牢耐用的大众化产品，而且有许多过去认为一时不能制造的高级产品，如高级防缩府绸、静电植绒织物，山羊绒织物，五彩香云纱，抗压立绒等等。这些质地优良的纺织品不仅更好地满足了国内人民各种不同的需要和爱好，而且受到了国外的欢迎和赞扬。十年来，我们还生产了许多过去要依赖进口的工业用纺织品，如工业用毡、轮胎用帘子布、电气用绝缘底布、工业用筛绢等，有力地支援了国家建设的需要。
    纺织品产量的迅速增长和花色品种的日益丰富多彩，使我国人民的衣着状况得到了很大改善。今年全国每人平均的棉布消费量将达到八米以上，要比1949年增加一倍多，其中农村人口将要增加二倍多。其他如针织品、毛线、呢绒、绸缎的平均每人消费量也逐年有所增长。以1958年与1952年比较，毛线增加了二点七倍，针织品增加了一倍半，呢绒、绸缎都增加了一倍以上。
    帝国主义者及其走狗目前正在极力诋毁我国的建设成就，特别是大跃进的成就，极力吹嘘资本主义国家的所谓繁荣，并恶毒地污蔑我国国民经济的迅速发展是以降低人民生活水平的代价获得的。那我们就以供应人民衣着需要的纺织工业发展速度来比一比吧。英国，这个曾在纺织工业上称霸一时的老牌资本主义国家，1949年的棉纱产量比我国同年多28％，而1958年，就只有我国同年产量的四分之一了。美国是目前世界上棉纱产量最高的国家，从它的纺织用棉资料推算，它从生产棉纱六百多万件增加到八百多万件，共花了近二十年左右的时间，以后虽曾一度增加到九百多万件，但近年来又下降到八百多万件。而我国只一年就可由六百一十万件增加到八百二十万件。面对着这一铁的事实，他们还有什么可以叫嚷的呢。他们声嘶力竭地进行诽谤和污蔑，只是更加暴露了他们内心的恐惧而已，丝毫也掩盖不住我国大跃进的无比灿烂的光辉！
    我国纺织工业能够取得这样辉煌的成就，是和党对人民衣着需要的深切关怀分不开的。党在领导我国人民进行社会主义建设过程中，一贯坚持在优先发展重工业的基础上积极地发展农业和轻工业的方针，这就保证了我国国民经济的各个部门互相协调地、按比例地、高速地向前发展，同时也保证了我国人民的生活在发展生产的基础上不断地得到改善。1958年，党又进一步提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一套两条腿走路的方针，在工业战线上开展了轰轰烈烈的大规模的群众运动，因而更充分地调动了全国人民建设社会主义的积极性，使纺织工业和其他部门一样，出现了空前大跃进的局面。中国共产党和我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，广大群众日益高涨的革命干劲，这是我们不断取得胜利的最根本的保证。
    纺织工业的高速度发展，首先得到了农业的巨大支援。解放以来，广大农民在党的领导下，彻底消灭了封建地主剥削，依靠农业合作化的巨大优越性，以及国家在价格政策、农业贷款等方面的鼓励和工业对农业的物质援助，在大力增产粮食的同时，积极地发展了棉毛麻丝等生产，改良了品种，使纺织工业的原料供应迅速走上了自给的道路。以1957年和1949年相比，棉花约增加了二点七倍，黄麻增加了八点五倍，羊毛和蚕茧也都增加了一倍以上。1958年，农业战线上出现了空前的生产大跃进和人民公社化运动，使棉花的实际收获量达到四千二百万担，比1957年猛增了28％，比第一个五年计划期间平均每年递增4.7％的速度增加了好几倍。这就大大地促进了纺织工业的跃进。今年，我国尽管遇到了特大的水旱灾害，但由于人民公社这一新的社会组织发挥了无比巨大的威力，粮棉生产仍将比大跃进的1958年有很大的增长。今后，随着人民公社的日益巩固和发展，化学纤维工业的日益成长和壮大，纺织工业的原料供应将越来越丰富，这是纺织工业高速度发展的极其有力的保证。
    建立我国独立自主的纺织机械工业，自力更生地解决设备问题，是迅速发展纺织工业的另一个重要条件。旧中国名义上有几家纺织机械厂，但规模狭小，设备简陋，技术落后，实际上大都只能做些修配工作。解放后，为了尽快地建设我们自己的纺织机械工业，国家对原有部分纺织机械修配厂进行扩建、改建和技术改造，增添大量新设备，使之成为具有一定规模的纺织机械制造厂；同时，大力新建了规模巨大具有现代技术装备的新型纺织机械厂，在全国范围内按照统一的规划，组织专业分工，协作配套，使每个机械厂根据自己的专长和技术经验，进行专业生产，因而迅速扩大了纺织机械的生产能力，提高了技术水平，适应了大规模生产的需要。到1958年为止，我国已生产了棉纺机三百八十余万锭，布机九万多台，毛麻丝纺织及印染设备也都能自己制造了。各类设备由于在设计和制造方面广泛地吸取了国内外的先进技术经验，质量和性能都很良好。它们不仅供应了国内大规模建厂的需要，而且还有出口。
    纺织原料和设备的自给，为我国纺织工业大规模基本建设提供了物质基础。第一个五年计划期间，国家用于纺织工业基本建设的投资即达十六亿元左右，占五年内全国工业总投资的6.4％，建设新厂七十余个，其中棉纺织四十余个，毛麻丝纺织二十余个。1958年以来，在党提出的中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针指导下，纺织工业的基本建设更加蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。1958和1959两年中列入国家计划的基本建设项目共达一百一十八个。到1958年为止，我国已投入生产的棉纺锭比1949年增加了70％左右，毛纺锭增加了36.4％，黄麻织机增加了一倍以上。内地产棉区的中心，如西安、郑州、石家庄、邯郸等地都已成为新兴的纺织工业基地。每个基地都拥有数量巨大的棉纺织设备，并已建成或正在兴建相应的印染加工设备，配备有完善的纺织机械修配厂，设立有专门培养纺织专业人才的学校，新疆、青海、内蒙古、宁夏、广西等少数兄弟民族地区也已经具有或正在新建近代化的纺织厂。这些新厂和老厂交相辉映，分布在全国极大部分的省、市、自治区，使我国纺织工业改变了过去偏处于沿海少数城市的不合理现象，在全国范围内出现了一个星罗棋布、遍地开花的新局面。
    在大力建设新厂的同时，充分发挥现有企业的潜力，是多快好省地发展纺织工业的另一个主要方面。在纺织工业中，原有老厂仍占全国设备的很大比重，充分发挥它们的作用，对增加生产、积累资金、培养人才、支援新厂建设等都有极重要的意义。解放以来，依靠党的领导和广大职工的努力，国家对原有老厂进行了一系列的改造工作。旧的官僚资本主义企业，在全国刚解放时就被没收为国家所有，成为国民经济中的领导成份。解放时占全国纺织工业总产值60％以上的私营纺织企业，经过社会主义改造，也于1956年全面实现了公私合营。在我国具有长期历史的为数众多的手工纺织业，根据国家统筹兼顾、全面安排的方针，在生产上作了妥善安排，并于1956年全面实现了合作化。在企业中，加强了党的领导，废除了各种旧的反动腐败的管理制度，建立了社会主义企业的管理制度；大力改善了原来极其恶劣的劳动条件；加强了设备的维护检修工作，进行了必要的改建、扩建和技术改造；不断总结和推广了各种先进技术操作经验，如郝建秀工作法、五一织布工作法、五三保全工作法等，使工人的技术水平得到了很大提高。职工的物质文化生活也得到了极大改善。仅原属中央领导的国营企业在第一个五年计划期间就新建了八十万平方米职工住宅，很多原来一字不识的工人，经过几年来的努力，已提高到中学水平。职工队伍也大大扩充了。以1958年和1949年相比，职工总人数增加一倍以上，其中工程技术人员增加了四倍以上。大批的优秀工人被提拔担任行政和技术方面的领导工作。这一切措施从根本上改变了原有企业的面貌，大大提高了广大职工的生产积极性，使企业的增产节约运动不断地发展，生产潜力得到很大的发挥。以棉纺工业为例：1957年与1949年相比，设备利用率提高了20％以上，中支棉纱全国平均每一千纺锭每一小时的产量由十八公斤增加到二十五公斤，增长40％左右；细纱工人看锭能力一般由每人看三百到四百锭增加到八百锭以上，每件棉纱的平均用棉量由二百一十公斤左右减少到一百九十三公斤左右。特别是1958年以来，由于整风运动和反右斗争的伟大胜利，以及企业中坚持政治挂帅，进一步贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，实行了“两参一改三结合”，使广大职工的革命干劲空前高涨。他们解放思想、破除迷信，开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动，使生产上出现了空前的跃进。如中支棉纱的每一千纺锭每一小时的产量，到1958年底提高到三十公斤以上，比1957年增加了20％以上，达到了国际上先进的水平。技术革新项目更是成千上万。如棉纺织工业方面研究成功的高产梳棉机单位产量可提高一倍左右；印染方面研究成功的双氧水漂白，可以使漂炼时间由二十到三十小时缩短到两三小时，同时还可以节约大量的蒸汽、水、电和酸碱，提高劳动生产率。
    在我国纺织工业建设中，以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义兄弟国家，给了我们极大的援助。苏联政府和人民以最新型的设备和精湛的技术帮助我国建设了哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂，同时还派遣了许多优秀的专家来我国具体指导基本建设和机械制造的设计，帮助我们解决了许多重要的生产关键问题。民主德国政府和人民，为我国首都第一座近代棉纺织厂提供了新型设备，帮助我国建设了保定人造纤维厂和北京合成纤维厂。其他兄弟国家也同样给了我们无私的援助。这种崇高的国际主义精神和兄弟般的深情厚谊，将永远铭记在我国人民的心中。
    十年来，新中国纺织工业的成就是十分巨大的。它使我们从一个进口棉花、棉布和纺织设备的国家变成了在纺织工业上能够独立自主的国家了。这充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性和新中国的伟大生命力。当然，对一个六亿多人口的国家说来，我国现有纺织工业的生产水平仍然是比较低的，要在纺织品的数量、质量、品种、花色等每个方面都充分满足人民日益增长的巨大需要，我们还必须在党的领导下，进行艰苦的奋斗，继续高速度地发展纺织工业。但是，我们既能在旧中国纺织工业那样落后的基础上取得像今天这样辉煌的胜利，我们就一定能够继续在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜下，进一步取得新的更大的胜利。
