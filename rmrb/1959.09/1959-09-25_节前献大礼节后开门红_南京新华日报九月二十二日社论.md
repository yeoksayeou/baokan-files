Presenting a Grand Gift Before the Holiday, Achieving a Flying Start Afterwards
    ——Nanjing Xinhua Daily Editorial, September 22nd
    Victorious news of the September Great Battle has arrived. Four hundred and sixty-five factories in Nanjing, Wuxi, and other cities have already completed their September production plans ahead of schedule. The workers of these factories, with heroic spirit, have put forward the battle cry of "Presenting a Grand Gift Before the Holiday, Achieving a Flying Start Afterwards," and set new goals. This is a slogan of striving for the best, a manifestation of exerting all-out effort. Although there are only nine days left until the end of the month, these nine days are of great potential. All workers in the province should treat these nine days as two nine days, three nine days, striving to over fulfill the September and third quarter plans, and present a grand gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country; and make good production preparations for October, creating favorable conditions for greater achievements in the fourth quarter.
    Why should we treat these last nine days of September as two nine days, three nine days? Because it is the crucial nine days to win a great victory in the third quarter, and the nine days to ensure a flying start in the fourth quarter. At the beginning of the month, we set lofty aspirations to make September the best month for completing the plan this year, and present a generous gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. Over the past twenty days, all industries and all fronts have been staging competitions, planting red flags, holding contests, and carrying out technical revolutions, pushing the movement to increase production and practice economy to a new high. In the first and middle ten-day periods, one victory report followed another, and more and more factories completed their third quarter and September plans ahead of schedule. Some factories and mines have even entered 1960 ahead of schedule. However, for the province as a whole, the number of factories that have completed their plans ahead of schedule is not yet the majority. To present a grand gift for the National Day, we require more factories to complete their plans ahead of schedule. Not only that, we must also see that October has three fewer working days due to the National Day holiday. In order to win the initiative in October, we must be tight in front and not tight in the back, and bring the work of the first ten days of October to the last ten days of September. Furthermore, October is the first month of the fourth quarter, and this battle must be fought well, striving for October to surpass September. Therefore, we must complete the production preparations for October and the fourth quarter by the end of September. Whether we can realize the lofty aspirations we set at the beginning of the month, and make September the best month for completing the plan this year, depends on these nine days; whether we can continuously strive for the best and ensure that October surpasses September, with every month being a success, is also closely related to how well we do our work in these few days. These nine days are extraordinary, and we must not relax for even a minute and a second, grasping them tightly and firmly.
    How to grasp? First of all, we must grasp the movement, grasp the comparisons, continue to sweep away rightism and boost morale, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy more deeply and widely. Since August and September, countless vivid facts have told us that the deeper and more thoroughly rightist ideas are opposed, the more vigorous the movement is, and the higher production jumps. According to the experience of some regions, ranking the differences between the advanced and the backward, and grasping comparisons, is a good way to educate cadres to overcome rightist emotions, and a good way to clarify the goals of struggle, mobilize the masses, and launch labor competitions. Because by ranking the differences, and comparing the advanced with the backward, the production potential can be clearly displayed, and right-wing conservatism can be broken with powerful facts; by ranking the differences and grasping comparisons, the banner of the advanced can be established, creating a strong political atmosphere of learning from the advanced, so that the backward can rise up to catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced, and the advanced can become even more advanced. This will inevitably promote the exchange of advanced experience, and the more in-depth and widespread development of technical revolution and technical innovation, so that production continues to rise. Leaders at all levels in all regions and industries should master and use this method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, not only comparing between industries and between factories, but also comparing between workshops, between groups, and between individuals; not only comparing output value and output, but also comparing quality and savings, and all technical and economic indicators. This can promote the comprehensive upsurge of the movement and ensure the over-fulfillment of the September plan.
    To achieve daily over-fulfillment of the plan in these last nine days, we must grasp the progress every day, grasp the progress at every level, and grasp the production in all aspects. Grasping the progress every day means grasping the key enterprises, key products, and key issues every day, even several times a day. Grasping the progress at every level means that the municipal and county party committees must grasp the production progress of each factory and mine, the party committees of each factory and mine must grasp the production progress of each workshop, and the workshop must grasp the progress of the group and even the individual; grasping production in all aspects means grasping not only output value but also output, quality, and other indicators. Grasping progress is to inspect production. If the progress is grasped tightly, we can quickly discover problems and immediately take measures to solve them quickly, and we can also discover the advanced in time, analyze and summarize them, and quickly spread advanced experience. Whether the progress is grasped tightly is a sign of whether the leading cadres have sufficient energy. People who are full of revolutionary energy always strive for the best at all times and never relax. Only by grasping the production progress tightly and constantly solving the problems in production can we constantly inspire the morale of the masses and make production improve every day and strive for the best at all times.
    While grasping production, we must also grasp logistics; while grasping the present, we must also grasp future production preparations. With the continuous development of the movement, new imbalances will inevitably occur in production. Some regions have recently felt that the supply of electricity, raw materials, and fuel is in short supply. In order to ensure that production leaps forward, so that the "front" has no worries, all regions should establish a strong logistics department, organize the forces of planning, transportation, and commerce departments, work together, and do a good job in the supply of raw materials, electricity, fuel and other materials, to meet the needs of the production leap forward. At the same time, all regions and factories should also grasp the production preparations for October and the fourth quarter, not only to do a good job in production arrangements, material supply, technical design and other preparations, but more importantly, to deliver the October production plan to the masses as early as possible, mobilize the masses to discuss, so that everyone is clear about the goals of the struggle, so that after the National Day holiday, they can immediately enter the battle and fire the first shot of October production. During this period, the party organizations of all factories and enterprises must do a strong job in political and ideological work, educating the workers to seize the opportunity before the holiday, seize every minute and second, and over fulfill the September and third quarter plans as much as possible; after the holiday, ensure that the energy is increased, go to work on time, attend all shifts, and invest in the October battle, so that "Presenting a Grand Gift Before the Holiday, Achieving a Flying Start Afterwards" becomes the action slogan of every worker. For the workers in iron and steel, electricity, transportation and other units who need to persist in production during the festival, it is even more necessary to give them cordial care, encourage them to carry forward the noble style of selfless labor, and celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with outstanding production achievements.

   节前献大礼节后开门红
    ——南京新华日报九月二十二日社论
    9月大战捷报传来，南京、无锡等市已有四百六十五家工厂提前完成了9月份生产计划；这些厂的职工又以豪迈的气概，提出了
  “节前献大礼，节后开门红”的战斗口号，订出了新的奋斗目标。这是个力争上游的口号，是鼓足干劲的表现。现在距离月底虽然只有九天时间，但是这九天是大有可为的九天。全省职工都应该把这九天当做两个九天、三个九天来过，争取更多地超额完成9月份和三季度计划，向建国十周年献大礼；并且做好10月份的生产准备工作，为四季度的更大成就创造良好条件。
    为什么要把9月份的这最后九天当做两个九天、三个九天来过呢？因为它是夺得三季度大胜的关键性的九天，是保证四季度开门红的九天。我们在月初曾经立下雄心大志，要使9月成为今年来完成计划最好的一个月，向建国十周年献上一份厚礼。二十天来，各行各业各路大军大摆擂台，大插红旗，大比大赛，大搞技术革命，把增产节约运动推向新的高涨。上、中两旬，胜利捷报一个接着一个，提前完成三季度和9月份计划的工厂越来越多，甚至有的厂矿已提前跨进了1960年。但是，就全省来说，提前完成计划的工厂还不是多数，我们要为国庆节献大礼，就要求更多的工厂都来提前完成计划。不但这样，我们还必须看到，10月份由于国庆休假而减少了三个工作日，为了争得10月份的主动，我们要紧前不紧后，把10月上旬的活拿到9月下旬来做。再者，10月份是四季度开头的一个月，这一仗一定要打好，力争10月超9月。因此，我们必须在9月底把10月份以及四季度的生产准备工作做好。我们能不能实现月初立下的雄心大志，使9月成为今年以来完成计划最好的一个月，就要看这九天；我们能不能不断争上游，保证10月超9月，月月满堂红，与这几天的工作做得好坏也有很大关系。这九天不同寻常，我们一定要一分一秒不放松，抓得既紧又狠。
    怎样抓？首先要抓运动、抓评比，继续横扫右倾、大鼓干劲，把增产节约竞赛运动更加深入、广泛地开展起来。8、9月以来，无数生动的事实告诉我们，右倾思想越反得深反得透，运动越是搞得轰轰烈烈，生产就跳得越高。根据有些地区的经验，排先进与落后之间的差异、抓评比，是教育干部克服右倾情绪的好方法，是明确奋斗目标，发动群众，开展劳动竞赛的好方法。因为通过排差异，通过先进与落后的比较，就可以明显地把生产潜力摆出来，以有力的事实打破右倾保守；通过排差异、抓对比，可以把先进的旗帜树立起来，造成强烈的学先进的政治气氛，使落后的奋起直追，赶上先进，超过先进，先进的做到更加先进。这样就必然会促进先进经验的交流，技术革命和技术革新的更加深入广泛的开展，使生产不断上升。各地区、各行业领导上都应当掌握和运用这种抓两头带中间的工作方法，不仅行业之间、厂厂之间要比，而且车间与车间、小组与小组、个人与个人之间也要比；不仅要比产值、比产量，还要比质量、比节约，各项技术经济指标都要比。这就可以推动运动全面高涨，保证9月计划超额完成。
    要在这最后九天中做到天天超额完成计划，就要天天抓进度，层层抓进度，全面抓生产。天天抓进度，就是要对重点企业、重点产品和关键问题天天抓，甚至一天抓几次。层层抓进度，就是市委、县委要抓各厂矿的生产进度，各厂矿党委要抓每个车间的生产进度，车间要抓小组以至个人的进度；全面抓生产，就是要既抓产值又抓产量、质量，及其它各项指标。抓进度就是对生产进行检查，进度抓得紧，就可以使我们很快发现问题，立即采取措施迅速解决，也可以使我们及时发现先进，加以分析总结，很快传播先进经验。进度抓得紧不紧，对于领导干部来说，就是衡量干劲足不足的一个标志。鼓足了革命干劲的人，总是时刻争上游，一着不放松的。只有抓紧生产进度，不断解决生产中的问题，才能不断鼓舞群众斗志，使生产天天向上，时时争得上游。
    在抓生产的同时，还必须抓后勤；在抓当前的同时，还必须抓今后的生产准备。随着运动的不断发展，生产上必然会出现新的不平衡。有些地区最近已感到电力、原料、燃料供不应求。为了保证生产大跳特跳，使“前方”无后顾之虑，各地都应建立一个强有力的后勤部，把计划、交通、商业等部门的力量组织起来，协同作战，作好原料、电力、燃料等物资供应工作，适应生产跃进的需要。与此同时，各地区、各厂矿还要把10月份和四季度的生产准备工作抓起来，不仅要做好生产安排、物资供应、技术设计等项准备工作，更重要的是及早把10月份的生产计划交给群众，发动群众进行讨论，使人人明确奋斗目标，以便国庆休假以后，立即投入战斗，打响10月生产头一炮。在这个期间，各厂矿企业党组织要强有力地做好政治思想工作，教育职工节前抓紧时机，争分夺秒，更多地超额完成9月份和三季度计划；节后保证劲上加劲，按时上工，全部出勤，投入10月大战，使“节前献大礼，节后开门红”成为每一个职工的行动口号。对于在节日里需要坚持生产的钢铁、电力、交通运输等单位的职工，更需要给以亲切的关怀，鼓励他们发扬忘我劳动的高尚风格，用出色的生产成就庆祝建国十周年。
