Achievements of Economic Construction in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
							Wu Xing

	Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Labor Party, the more than 13 million people in North Vietnam have made brilliant achievements in economic construction. At present, they are moving from victory to greater victory at an accelerated pace.
	In the early days of peace restoration, the Vietnamese people began to restore the economy under very difficult conditions. French imperialism ruled Vietnam for nearly a hundred years, frantically plundering Vietnam's resources and strangling the development of colonial industry. Representatives of French monopoly capital groups have more than once bluntly emphasized the need to safeguard the interests of the so-called "suzerain state" (France) industry and prevent the gathering and growth of the colonial proletariat. They decided that the exploitation and plunder of the Vietnamese people should be mainly based on commodity exports, not capital exports. Obviously, the imperialists wanted to keep the more than 20 million Vietnamese people in a state of backwardness and poverty forever. Therefore, after the restoration of peace, what lay before the Vietnamese people was a backward country that had been devastated by more than ten years of brutal war. The main difficulties at the time were: most of the factories, railways, and highways were destroyed, and many large-scale farmland water conservancy projects were destroyed; colonialism left behind serious unemployment; and there was a great shortage of economic work cadres and scientific and technical personnel.
	When the French colonialists withdrew, they gloated and clamored to wait and see the Vietnamese people fail. However, the heroic Vietnamese people answered the enemy's shameful conspiracy with amazing achievements.
	After the 1954 Geneva Conference, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, after full preparation, relying on the workers and the masses, smoothly completed the takeover of the cities, stabilized social order, and ensured the normalization of urban life. At the same time, under the leadership of the Labor Party, the Vietnamese people began a three-year (1955-1957) economic recovery effort.
	The rapid restoration of transportation was the top priority at that time. The Party and the government issued an urgent call, mobilizing the people to repair the Hanoi-Muc Nam Quan railway in the shortest possible time with the support of fraternal countries. In the first half of 1955, the Vietnamese railway department began to handle international through transport services, connecting Hanoi, the capital of the Vietnamese people, with Moscow and the capitals of other fraternal countries. In August 1956, the Hanoi-Lao Cai railway was also restored. Then, the Hanoi-Nam Dinh-Thanh Hoa railway was also repaired. At the same time, the Republic government also vigorously developed inland river transportation and maritime transportation, and the mileage of highways open to traffic in the entire North Vietnam increased more than threefold. In addition, international civil aviation transportation was also carried out. This not only facilitated international exchanges, but also greatly developed urban-rural exchanges, and promoted the improvement of production and people's lives.
	According to the policies of the Party and the government, agricultural production is the focus of Vietnam's economic recovery. After the restoration of peace, Vietnam continued land reform in the newly liberated areas. About seven million farmers were allocated nearly 700,000 hectares of land, eliminating the heavy exploitation of the reactionary landlord class and greatly liberating the productive forces. In addition to land, livestock, and farm tools, farmers increased their income by 600,000 tons of rice simply by being exempted from paying rent to landlords, which greatly boosted their enthusiasm for production. The state attached great importance to water conservancy and irrigation, and actively repaired various large-scale water conservancy projects that had been destroyed by the war. In 1955 alone, thirteen large-scale farmland water conservancy systems were restored, many medium-sized and small-scale water conservancy projects were renovated, and more than 3,000 kilometers of river embankments and more than 400 concrete culverts were repaired and consolidated. After 1956, five more large-scale water conservancy projects were built. By 1958, the national large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy irrigation area had reached 47% of the area of early and late rice fields. In the second half of 1958, construction began on the largest Bac Hung Hai Xuan Quang water gate project, which was completed in May 1959. This project irrigates more than 160,000 hectares of farmland in the Bac Ninh, Hung Yen, and Hai Duong regions. These measures have continuously improved agricultural production. In terms of rice alone, more than 4.57 million tons were harvested in 1958, an increase of 26.8% compared with 1955 and an increase of 89.9% compared with 1939 before the war. The early rice harvest in 1959 has been unprecedentedly abundant, and it is expected that the annual output will increase even more than last year.
	For the Vietnamese people, restoring industrial production is an arduous task. It is necessary to repair the destroyed factory machinery; to do a good job in business management and properly solve a series of problems such as supply, production, and sales; and to quickly train technical and business cadres. Under the leadership of the Party and with the enthusiastic support of fraternal countries, the Vietnamese working class has overcome numerous difficulties and continuously achieved success. By 1957, within a short period of three years, the enterprises in the liberated areas during the war of resistance were maintained and expanded; some power plants, water plants, and coal mining enterprises were restored and production developed; and some large enterprises destroyed by the enemy, such as the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, the Hai Phong Cement Plant, as well as wineries, woolen mills, soap factories, and paper mills, were renovated and expanded. During the three-year economic recovery period, a number of new enterprises with modern equipment and modern technical level were also built, such as machinery factories, power plants, tin mines, apatite mines, rice mills, tea processing plants, and match factories. All of this has strengthened the foundation for Vietnam's industrial development. The growth of the output value of state-owned industry, with 1955 as 100, was 822.3 in 1957. Due to the continuous investment of new enterprises in production and the improvement of the management level of existing enterprises, the output value of state-owned industry in 1958 increased by 64.4% compared with 1957. In the first half of 1959, the total output value of state-owned industry increased by 80.9% compared with the same period last year.
	In order to quickly change the serious situation of lack of technical cadres, the Party and the government have taken a series of effective measures: sending thousands of cadres and workers to fraternal countries for long-term study and short-term internships and inspections; establishing a multi-disciplinary engineering university and opening various intermediate and primary technical schools to train technical and business cadres for various economic sectors; setting up various short-term training courses to train a large number of accounting, statistics, planning, surveying, and other work cadres; in addition, with the assistance of experts from fraternal countries, tens of thousands of cadres and workers familiar with the business have also been trained in practical work.
	In order to transform the economy that once served imperialism into an economy suitable for the needs of the people, and to rapidly reduce urban unemployment, the Party and the government have done a lot of work. In addition to the employees absorbed by state-owned industry, the state has also resettled the unemployed through methods such as job placement, organizing self-help production, work-for-relief, and mobilizing them to return to their hometowns for production. Over the past five years, 240,000 people in North Vietnam have been placed in jobs, and the employment problem of the working people can be basically solved next year.
	In terms of trade and commerce, due to the rapid growth of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, the stability of market prices and the supply of people's daily necessities have been effectively guaranteed. The proportion of wholesale of goods by state-owned commerce accounted for 52.6% of the total wholesale volume in 1957 and 73.5% in 1958; the proportion of retail sales of goods by state-owned and cooperative commerce accounted for 29.9% of the total retail volume in 1957 and 42% in 1958. Foreign trade is almost entirely controlled by the state. The volume of import and export trade has increased year by year. The export value in 1957 increased by 4.7 times compared with 1955, and increased by 22.3% in 1958 compared with 1957. Vietnam's coal, cement, and agricultural and forestry products, in addition to supporting fraternal countries, also sell well in many capitalist countries in Asia and Europe.
	In early 1958, the Vietnamese government announced that the economic recovery work had been completed, and the first long-term plan for building socialism in Vietnam—the three-year (1958-1960) economic development plan—began in 1958. The Fourteenth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party formulated and adopted this magnificent plan and submitted it to the Ninth National Assembly for discussion and approval. The three-year plan puts forward three main tasks: first, to strengthen the development of industrial and agricultural production, with agricultural production as the mainstay, with special attention to solving the food problem, while paying attention to industrial production, vigorously increasing the production of means of production, and solving the needs of most daily consumer goods; second, to vigorously carry out the socialist transformation of agricultural handicrafts and private capitalist industry and commerce, the main link of which is to strengthen agricultural cooperation; third, to further improve the material and cultural life of the people, especially the working people, on the basis of developing production, and to strengthen and consolidate national defense. The plan also requires that during the implementation of the three-year plan, preparations should be actively made for the first five-year plan: attention should be paid to investigation and exploration work, the planning of various economic regions and departments should be studied, cadres and technical forces should be prepared, and the first five-year plan should be drafted in a timely manner.
	The three-year plan proposes that the total output value of industry and agriculture in 1960 should increase by 78% compared with 1957, with an annual increase of 21.2%. Among them, agriculture increased by 73.6%, and the entire industry increased by 143%. The output value of state-owned industry increased by 216.7% in three years, with an annual increase of 46.9%.
	The plan requires that rice production in 1960 will increase to 7.6 million tons (6.2 million tons in 1959), an increase of 92% compared with 1957. By 1960, the average rice per person will reach 500 kilograms; if cereals are added, it will reach 600 kilograms per person per year. In three years, cotton will increase by 58%, sugarcane will increase by 86%, and peanuts will increase by 1.3 times. The main way to increase agricultural production is to increase the yield per unit area. The average yield per hectare of single-season rice will increase from 1.8 tons in 1957 to 3.28 tons. In order to achieve this goal, on the one hand, the mutual aid and cooperation movement should be developed; on the other hand, technical measures such as water, fertilizer, seed, deep plowing, and close planting should be emphasized.
	The total amount of basic construction investment in the three-year plan increased by 94.3% compared with the three-year economic recovery period. Among them, industrial investment increased by 212.2%, and the proportion of industrial investment accounted for 46.52%. There are a total of 186 construction projects above the limit in three years (125 new projects started during the three-year plan). After all these basic construction projects are completed, Vietnam will initially have its own industrial system, greatly changing its previous backwardness; a new and strong technical team will also grow up, preparing for the next more ambitious long-term national economic plan.
	The resolution of the Fourteenth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party and the three-year plan clearly announced that the task of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce will be basically completed by 1960.
	Among the above-mentioned three major transformations, agricultural cooperation is the main link. The task of guiding farmers to join the lower-level agricultural production cooperatives will be basically completed before 1960, and some cooperatives will be upgraded to advanced cooperatives. The Party requires consolidating the permanent mutual aid teams with work points and planned, steady, and guided expansion of the organization and cooperation movement; emphasizing socialist education among farmers; and requiring party committees at all levels to regularly go deep into the countryside to lead labor exchange teams and cooperatives, pay attention to training cadres, and improve the quality of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in all aspects. In May of this year, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Chinh delivered a report on "Resolutely Lead the Farmers of Our Northern Country to Socialism through the Road of Agricultural Cooperation" on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party and the government at the Tenth National Assembly, making a detailed analysis of the specific situation of various classes in the Vietnamese countryside, and making an affirmative evaluation of the desire of the broad masses of farmers to take the road of cooperation. Deputy Prime Minister Truong Chinh clearly pointed out that the Party's class line in the countryside is: "Resolutely rely on poor and lower-middle peasants, closely unite with middle peasants, limit and even eliminate the economic exploitation of rich peasants, and transform the thinking of rich peasants. Prevent landlords from rising, and continue to give landlords the opportunity to reform themselves through labor and become new people. Resolutely guide farmers to take the road of cooperation to enter socialism." Since 1958, especially in the second half of the year, a wave of demand for cooperation has appeared in the Vietnamese countryside. By the end of 1958, households participating in mutual aid teams accounted for 65.5% of the total number of households in the North; households joining cooperatives accounted for 5% of the total number of households. In the first half of this year, households participating in cooperatives accounted for 21% of the total number of households.
	In terms of handicraft cooperation, the 1959 plan is to organize 80% of all handicraftsmen in North Vietnam, of which 50% will participate in handicraft production cooperatives. By mid-August of this year, the organized handicraftsmen accounted for 51.8% of the total number of handicraftsmen.
	The three-year plan stipulates that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce should expand the pilot work of joint state-private capitalist industries, and then comprehensively carry out joint state-private operation; other transformation forms should also be tested. At the same time, the transformation of capitalist commerce should also be accelerated.
	At present, more than 100 private industrial enterprises have been approved by the government to implement joint state-private operation, and the joint operation of commercial households is also gradually expanding. The Hanoi Municipal People's Congress decided to implement joint state-private operation of 90% of the city's capitalist industrial and commercial households within this year.
	The above-mentioned many facts show that the Vietnamese people are moving from victory to greater victory at an accelerated pace.

    越南民主共和国经济建设的成就	吴兴
    五年来，越南北方一千三百多万人民在劳动党的领导下，在经济建设方面取得了辉煌的成就。目前，他们正在以加快的速度从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    和平恢复的初期，越南人民是在非常困难的条件下着手恢复经济工作的。法帝国主义统治越南将近一百年，疯狂地掠夺越南的资源，扼杀殖民地工业的发展。法国垄断资本集团的代表们曾经不止一次露骨地强调，要维护所谓
  “宗主国”（法国）工业的利益，防止殖民地无产者的聚集和成长。他们决定，对越南人民的剥削和搜刮，以商品输出为主，不以资本输出为主。显然，帝国主义者是要使两千多万越南人民永远处在落后和贫困的境地。因此，和平恢复后，摆在越南人民面前的是一个落后的、又经过十几年残酷战争破坏的国家。当时面临的主要困难是：工厂、铁路、公路绝大部分被破坏，许多大型农田水利工程被摧毁；殖民主义留下了严重的失业现象；经济工作干部和科学技术人员非常缺乏。
    当法国殖民者撤退的时候，他们曾幸灾乐祸地扬言，要等待看越南人民失败。但是，英雄的越南人民却以惊人的成就来回答敌人可耻的阴谋。
    1954年日内瓦会议之后，越南民主共和国政府经过充分的准备，依靠工人，依靠群众，顺利地完成了城市接管工作，稳定了社会秩序，保证了城市生活的正常化。与此同时，越南人民在劳动党的领导下，开始了三年（1955—1957年）恢复经济工作。
    迅速恢复交通是当时迫不及待的首要任务。党和政府发出紧急号召，动员人民在兄弟国家支援下，在最短的几个月内，修通了河内—睦南关铁路。1955年上半年，越南铁路部门就开始办理国际联运业务，把越南人民首都河内和莫斯科以及其他各个兄弟国家的首都连结起来。1956年8月，又恢复了河内—老街铁路。接着，河内—南定—清化铁路也修通了。同时，共和国政府还大力发展内河运输和海上运输，全北越公路的通车里程也增加了三倍以上。此外，还举办了国际民用航空运输。这样，不仅便利了国际间的相互往来，也大大发展了城乡交流，促进生产的提高和人民生活的改善。
    根据党和政府的政策，农业生产是越南恢复经济的重点。和平恢复后，越南继续在新解放地区进行土地改革。约有七百万农民分到近七十万公顷的土地，取消了反动地主阶级的重重剥削，大大解放了生产力。农民除了分得土地、耕畜、农具之外，仅免除向地主交租一项即增加了六十万吨稻谷的收入，因而生产积极性空前高涨。国家对水利灌溉事业十分重视，积极修复被战争破坏的各个大型水利工程。仅在1955年即恢复了十三个大型农田水利系统，整修了许多中小型水利，修固河堤三千多公里及混凝土涵闸四百多处。1956年以后又增修大型水利工程五处。到1958年，全国大、中、小型水利灌溉面积已达早稻和晚稻耕地面积的47％。1958年下半年又动工兴修规模最大的北兴海春光水闸工程，1959年5月完工。这个工程使北宁、兴安、海阳地区十六万公顷以上的农田得到灌溉。这些措施使农业生产不断提高。单就稻谷一项来说，1958年即收获四百五十七万多吨，较1955年增长26.8％，较战前1939年增长89.9％。1959年早稻已获空前大丰收，预计全年产量将较去年有更大的增长。
    对越南人民来说，恢复工业生产是一项艰巨的任务。要把破坏了的工厂机器修好；要搞好经营管理，妥善解决供、产、销等一系列问题；要迅速培养技术和业务干部。越南工人阶级在党的领导下，在各兄弟国家的热情支援下，冲破了重重困难，不断地取得成就。到1957年为止，在短短的三年中，维持并扩建了抗战时期解放区的企业；恢复了若干电力厂、自来水厂、煤矿企业等并发展了生产；重新修复和扩建了被敌人破坏了的一些大企业如南定纺织厂、海防水泥厂以及酒厂、绒线厂、肥皂厂、造纸厂等等。在三年恢复经济中，还新建了一批具有现代设备的和现代技术水平的新企业如机器厂、发电厂、锡矿、磷灰石矿、碾米厂、茶叶加工厂、火柴厂等。所有这些工作，都加强了越南工业发展的基础。国营工业产值的增长，以1955年为一百，则1957年为八百二十二点三。由于新建企业不断投入生产和旧有企业管理水平的提高，1958年国营工业产值又较1957年增长64.4％。1959年上半年，国营工业总产值比去年同期增长80.9％。
    为了迅速改变缺乏技术干部的严重状况，党和政府采取了一系列有效措施：派遣成千干部和工人到兄弟国家进行长期学习和短期的实习考察；创办了一所多科性的工科大学并开办多种中级和初级技术学校，培养各经济部门的技术和业务干部；设立各种短期训练班，训练大批会计、统计、计划、测量等工作干部；此外，在兄弟国家专家的协助下，在实际工作中也造就了成千上万熟悉业务的干部和工人。
    为了把过去为帝国主义服务的经济改造为适合人民需要的经济，并使城市失业现象迅速减少，党和政府做了大量工作。除了国营工业所吸收的职工外，国家还通过介绍就业、组织生产自救、以工代赈、动员还乡生产等办法对失业人员作了安置。五年来，越南北方已有二十四万人被安排了工作，明年就可以基本上解决劳动人民的就业问题。
    在贸易和商业方面，由于国营商业和合作社商业的迅速壮大，有力地保证了市场物价的稳定和人民生活必需品的供应。国营商业的商品批发比重，1957年占批发总额的52.6％，1958年占73.5％；国营与合作社商业的商品零售比重，1957年占零售总额的29.9％，1958年占42％。对外贸易几乎全部由国家掌握。进出口贸易额逐年增长，1957年出口金额较1955年增长四点七倍，1958年又较1957年增加22.3％。越南的煤炭、水泥、农林产品除支援兄弟国家外，还畅销亚、欧许多资本主义国家。
    1958年初，越南政府宣布经济恢复工作已经完成，自1958年起开始越南第一个建设社会主义的长期计划——三年（1958—1960年）发展经济计划。越南劳动党第十四次中央全会扩大会议制定和通过了这个雄伟的计划，提交第九次国会讨论通过。三年计划提出了三个主要任务：第一，加强发展工农业生产，以农业生产为主，其中特别要解决粮食问题，同时注意工业生产，大力增加生产资料生产，并解决大部分日用消费品的需要；第二，大力进行农业手工业和私人资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，其主要环节是加强农业合作化；第三，在发展生产的基础上进一步提高人民、特别是劳动人民的物质文化生活，并加强巩固国防。计划还要求在实现三年计划期间，积极为第一个五年计划作准备：注意调查、勘探工作，研究各经济区域和各个部门的规划，准备干部和技术力量并及时起草第一个五年计划。
    三年计划提出1960年的工农业总产值要较1957年增长78％，每年递增21.2％。其中，农业增长73.6％，全部工业增长143％。国营工业产值三年增长216.7％，每年递增46.9％。
    计划要求1960年稻谷产量将增加到七百六十万吨（1959年计六百二十万吨），较1957年增长92％。到1960年，平均每人稻谷要达到五百公斤；如加上杂粮，每人每年达六百公斤。三年内棉花要增长58％，甘蔗增长86％，花生增长一点三倍。农业增产的主要途径是提高单位面积产量，稻谷平均每公顷单季产量要从1957年的一点八吨增加到三点二八吨。为了达到这个指标，一方面发展互助合作运动；另一方面强调水、肥、种、深耕、密植等技术措施。
    三年计划的基本建设投资总额，较三年经济恢复时期增加94.3％。其中，工业投资增加212.2％，工业投资额的比重占46.52％。三年内限额以上的建设工程共一百八十六项（在三年计划期间新开工的一百二十五项）。这些基本建设工程项目全部建成后，越南将初步有了自己的一套工业体系，大大改变以往的落后面貌；一批新的、强大的技术队伍也将成长起来，为下一个更加宏大的国民经济长期计划作准备。
    越南劳动党第十四次中央全会决议和三年计划中明确宣布，到1960年将基本上完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
    在上述三大改造中，农业合作化是主要环节。要在1960年以前基本上完成引导农民加入低级形式的农业生产合作社，并将部分合作社提高到高级社的任务。党要求巩固有评工计分的常年互助组，稳妥地、有计划地、有领导地扩大组织合作社运动；强调在农民中进行社会主义教育；要求各级党委经常深入农村领导变工组和合作社，注意培养干部，在各方面提高互助合作运动的质量。今年5月，长征副总理代表越南劳动党中央和政府在第十次国会上作了“坚决使我国北方农民通过农业合作化的道路走向社会主义”的报告，对越南农村各阶级的具体情况作了详尽的分析，对广大农民要求走合作化的道路作了肯定的评价。长征副总理明确指出，党在农村的阶级路线是：“坚决依靠贫农和下中农，紧密团结中农，限制以至消灭富农的经济剥削，改造富农思想。防止地主抬头，继续给地主以劳动改造和成为新人的出路。坚决引导农民走上合作化的道路以进入社会主义”。1958年特别是下半年以来，越南农村出现要求合作化的热潮，1958年底参加互助组的农户已占北方农户总数的65.5％；加入合作社的农户占农户总数5％。今年上半年，参加合作社的农户已占农户总数21％。
    在手工业合作化方面，1959年计划要把占越南北方全体手工业者的80％组织起来，其中50％参加手工业生产合作社。到今年8月中旬，组织起来的手工业者已占手工业者总数的51.8％。
    对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作，三年计划规定，要扩大资本主义工业公私合营的试点工作，进而全面开展公私合营；还要试验其他改造形式。同时，也要加紧改造资本主义商业。
    目前，已有一百多个私营工业企业获得政府批准实行公私合营，商业户的合营工作，也正在逐步扩大。河内市人民议会决定，在今年内要把本市的90％的资本主义工商业户实行公私合营。
    上述的许多事实表明，越南人民正在以加快的速度从胜利走向更大的胜利。
