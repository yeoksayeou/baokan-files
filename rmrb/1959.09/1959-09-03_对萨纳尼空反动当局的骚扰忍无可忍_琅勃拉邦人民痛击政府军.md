Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 2nd: This paper reprinted on September 1st a report from the "Khuang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" on the victorious struggle of the people of Luang Prabang Province, Laos, against the terror searches conducted by the troops of Phoui Sananikone.

The report said that in early August, the Phoui Sananikone troops stationed in Sopsao, eastern Luang Prabang Province, conducted searches in the Ha Wu area, robbing local residents of pigs and poultry, raping women, and torturing those considered sympathetic to the Lao fighting forces.

The local residents were outraged by this barbaric behavior and, with the help of the guerrillas, drove the Phoui Sananikone troops back to their stronghold.

On August 14th, the local people went to the stronghold to demand compensation and the return of the stolen goods. The commander of the stronghold ordered his men to fire on the people. The people's self-defense forces were forced to retaliate. The fighting lasted all day. Many soldiers in the stronghold responded to the people's call, escaped and joined the people's ranks; many others abandoned their weapons and fled into the forest. That evening, two companies of Phoui Sananikone's troops were forced to abandon the stronghold. The enthusiastic masses immediately destroyed the stronghold's bunkers and prisons, recovered the stolen goods, and captured a large number of weapons and other military equipment, including a radio station.

Subsequently, the local residents held a rally to celebrate this victory against the atrocities of Phoui Sananikone's troops.

    对萨纳尼空反动当局的骚扰忍无可忍
    琅勃拉邦人民痛击政府军
    新华社河内2日电　此间报纸1日转载了“川圹老挝爱国报”报道老挝琅勃拉邦省人民反抗培·萨纳尼空军队的恐怖搜查的胜利斗争的消息。
    消息说，在8月上旬，驻在琅勃拉邦省东部索桑的培·萨纳尼空军队到哈吴地区进行搜查，并且抢劫当地居民的猪和家禽，强奸妇女，拷打那些被认为同情寮国战斗部队的人。
    当地居民对这种野蛮行为感到愤怒，在游击队的帮助下，把培·萨纳尼空的军队赶回据点。
    8月14日，当地人民到据点去要求赔偿和归还被抢走的东西。据点的指挥官下令向人民开枪。人民自卫武装被迫还击。战斗持续一整天。据点里有许多士兵响应人民的呼吁，逃出来加入人民的队伍；另外有许多人丢弃了他们的武器，逃到森林里去。当天晚上，培·萨纳尼空的两连军队被迫放弃这个据点。热情的群众立即平毁了这个据点的碉堡和监狱，收回被抢走的东西，并且缴获了大量武器和其它军事装备，其中包括一部电台。
    随后，当地居民举行了集会，庆祝这次反抗培·萨纳尼空军队的暴行的胜利。
