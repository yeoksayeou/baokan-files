Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 5th: The "Khuang Lao Patriotic News" reported on September 1st that U.S. imperialism and the government of Phoui Sananikone recently continued to increase troops in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, intensifying their "sweeping" operations and cruelly suppressing and persecuting the people in these areas.

Facing this situation, the local people and the people's armed forces have resolutely counterattacked the Kingdom's army, forcing them to withdraw from their strongholds in Muong Khoua and Muong Et in Sam Neua province, and Muong Khoa in Phongsaly province at the end of August.

In the above-mentioned anti-"sweeping" battles, the Lao Kingdom army suffered some casualties, and more than a dozen soldiers defected to the people's side. The Kingdom's army, fleeing in disarray, abandoned a large number of weapons, ammunition, and grain, cattle and horses plundered from the local people.

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: Honolulu dispatch: U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Felt admitted that the United States has been arming the Lao Kingdom army with military supplies for several years, and clamored that the U.S. Pacific Fleet is ready to intervene in the situation in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia by armed force at any time. Felt said at a press conference on the 2nd: "For several years, supplies have been shipped to Laos. The recent shipments—small arms and light equipment—have been increased because of the special situation now existing there."

Felt expressed concern that the current U.S. "aid" to the Lao Kingdom government could not subdue the Lao people. He clamored: "All units of the (U.S.) Pacific Command are closely watching the (Laos) situation." He also said that if necessary, the U.S. Pacific Fleet is ready to intervene in any part of the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia at any time.

    美军头子费耳特竟叫嚷要武装干涉老挝局势
    新华社河内5日电　越南通讯社今天据“川圹老挝爱国报”9月1日的消息报道：美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府最近继续向桑怒和丰沙里两省增调军队，加紧扩大“扫荡”行动，残酷镇压和迫害这些地区的人民。
    面对这种局势，当地人民和人民的武装力量给予王国军队以坚决的反击，并且迫使王国军队在8月底撤出桑怒省的川库、孟埃和丰沙里省的芒科等据点。
    在上述反“扫荡”战斗中，老挝王国军队有若干伤亡，还有十多人投向人民方面。临阵窜逃的王国军队丢弃了大批武器、弹药和从当地人民那里抢来的粮食和牛马。
    新华社4日讯　檀香山消息：美国太平洋舰队司令费耳特承认几年以来美国一直以军事物资武装老挝王国军队，并叫嚷说美国太平洋舰队随时准备武装干预西太平洋和东南亚局势。费耳特2日在一次记者招待会上说：“好几年来，（美国）供应物资一直向老挝运去。最近运去的物资——小型武器和轻型装备——是因为现在那里产生的特别局势而增加的。”
    费耳特表示担心美国目前对老挝王国政府的“援助”不能压服老挝人民。他叫嚷说：“（美国）太平洋司令部的所有部队都在密切注视着（老挝）局势。”并说，如果有必要的话，美国太平洋舰队随时都能够干预西太平洋和东南亚任何地区。
