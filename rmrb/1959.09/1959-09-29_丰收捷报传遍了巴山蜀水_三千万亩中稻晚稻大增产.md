Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 28th: News of bumper harvests across a large area of Sichuan Province's main grain crops – over 41 million mu of mid-season rice and single-season late rice – has spread like wildfire, with over 33 million mu already harvested.

Both disaster-stricken and non-disaster-stricken areas, mountainous regions and plains, high-yield and low-yield areas, have achieved substantial increases in production across large areas. In the famous granary of the western Sichuan plain, over 4 million mu of mid-season rice have generally increased production by 10% to 20%. In the Xichang region, the average yield of 150,000 mu of harvested mid-season rice has exceeded 900 jin per mu, an increase of 25% compared to last year. In the hilly Lezhi County, the average yield of 200,000 mu of mid-season rice is 800 jin per mu, an increase of 40% compared to last year. Rong County, which recently launched a "Non-Disaster Areas Greatly Increase Production" competition across the province, has an average yield of 700 jin per mu on over 170,000 mu of mid-season rice, an increase of nearly 20% compared to last year. Areas severely affected by drought have also achieved bumper harvests. In Kaijiang County, the average yield of over 230,000 mu of mid-season rice reached 1,012 jin per mu, making it the first county in the province to achieve a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu this year. Wanxian, Daxian, and Mianyang were the most severely drought-stricken areas in Sichuan this year, but many counties and communes still achieved substantial increases in production across large areas. In Shehong County, which suffered the worst drought in decades, the yield of over 120,000 mu of mid-season rice increased by 10% compared to last year, and due to the expansion of the area, the total output increased by 65%. In the severely affected Nanchong region, over 4 million mu of mid-season rice have achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest, with the yield per mu increasing by 10% compared to last year.

This year, Sichuan's mid-season rice suffered from the worst drought in decades during the flowering and heading stages, and many places were also affected by waterlogging and pests. In Wanxian, Jiangjin, Daxian and other regions, the area of mid-season rice with cracked soil due to water shortage reached more than half. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the province established the idea that man can conquer nature, fully utilized the strength of the people's communes, and persisted in fighting the drought to the end. Men and women, young and old, were mobilized, and a total of more than 20 million laborers were invested in the drought resistance effort.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of mid-season rice, Party committees at all levels across the province have closely grasped every link from planting to harvesting, constantly organized inspections, deeply mobilized the masses, and launched mass movements. The broad masses each found opponents and carried out rich and varied forms of competition. Party committee leaders and cadres at all levels have always gone deep into the countryside, sharing weal and woe with the masses, planting experimental fields to enrich their leadership experience and establish models. The twelve regions and cities alone planted a total of more than 2 million mu of experimental fields, and the yield was generally about 30% higher than ordinary fields. (Attached image)

    丰收捷报传遍了巴山蜀水
    三千万亩中稻晚稻大增产
    据新华社成都28日电　四川省主要粮食作物——四千一百多万亩中稻和一季晚稻，已经收割了三千三百多万亩。大面积丰收捷报有如春花怒放，传遍巴山蜀水。
    曾经受过灾的地区和非灾区，山地和平原，高产区和低产区，都获得大面积增产。著名谷仓川西平原，四百多万亩中稻一般都增产一成到两成。西昌专区已收的十五万亩中稻，平均亩产超过九百斤，比去年增产两成半。丘陵区乐至县二十万亩中稻，平均亩产八百斤，比去年增产四成。最近首先向全省发起“无灾区大大增产”竞赛的荣县，十七万多亩中稻，平均亩产七百斤，比去年增产近两成。曾经受到严重干旱的地区，也夺得了丰收。开江县二十三万多亩中稻，平均亩产达一千零一十二斤，是全省今年第一个中稻千斤县。万县、达县、绵阳是四川今年干旱最严重的地区，但仍有许多县、社获得大面积增产。遭受了几十年未有的大旱的射洪县，十二万多亩中稻亩产比去年增加一成，由于扩大了面积，总产量增加65％。重灾区的南充专区，四百多万亩中稻全面丰收，亩产比去年增加一成。
    今年四川中稻在扬花抽穗期间遭受了几十年来未有的干旱，不少地方还先后受到内涝和虫害。万县、江津、达县等专区中稻断水开裂面积达一半以上。但是，全省人民在党的领导下，树立人定胜天的思想，充分发挥人民公社的力量，坚持抗旱到底。男女老少一齐出动，全省先后投入抗旱的劳力达两千多万人。
    为了争取中稻大丰收，全省各级党委从种到收，环环抓紧，不断组织检查，深入发动群众，大搞群众运动。广大群众各找对手，开展了内容丰富、形式多样的对手赛，连环赛。各地党委领导人和广大干部始终深入农村，和群众同甘共苦，大种指挥田，丰富领导经验，树立标兵。仅十二个专区和市，就共种指挥田二百多万亩，产量一般都高出普通田三成左右。（附图片）
    中稻、晚稻的清香，飘遍了巴山蜀水。这两个姑娘正在愉快地翻晒丰收果实。人们用以下的话句描述当时的情景：中稻丰收心里欢，巴蜀姑娘晒谷忙。
