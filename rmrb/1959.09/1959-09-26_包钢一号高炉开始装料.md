Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, September 24th: The Baotou Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace began charging materials into the furnace at 1:05 AM on the 24th.

The overall joint trial operation of the No. 1 Blast Furnace system, which began on the evening of the 21st, demonstrates the excellent engineering quality of this world-class large blast furnace. From the automatic signals on the instrument panel in the blast furnace duty room, it can be seen that the two charging cars travel freely up and down the inclined bridge track; the large bell, small bell, and distributor, which automatically control the charging at the top of the furnace, open and close rhythmically; and the weighing cars in the material bin trestle move back and forth. The temperature at the top of the three hot blast stoves has reached about 1,000 degrees. As soon as the gas worker opened the hot air pipe switch, the cold air sent from the steam blower station to the hot blast stove quickly turned into hot air and rushed into the blast furnace. All of these operations are performed entirely by workers operating mechanical and electrical equipment.

    包钢一号高炉开始装料
    新华社包头24日电　包钢一号高炉24日晨一时零五分开始向炉内装料。
    从21日晚上开始的一号高炉系统总体联合试运转表明，这座世界上第一流的大高炉，工程质量良好。从高炉值班室计器盘上的自动信号上可以看到：两个上料车沿着斜桥轨道上下行驶自如；炉顶自动控制上料的大钟、小钟、布料器等，有节奏地启开和关闭，料仓栈桥里的称量车来回走动。三座热风炉的炉顶温度，已经达到一千度左右。瓦斯工把热风管的开关一打开，从蒸气鼓风机站送到热风炉的冷风，迅速变成热风冲入高炉。所有这些操作，完全是由工人操纵机械和电气设备进行的。
