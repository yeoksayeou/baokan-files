Anhui Builds Converters: Leaders Determined, Labor Well-Organized;
Twenty-Eight Converters Put into Production in Four Months

This newspaper reports that Anhui Province, drawing on its experience in building small indigenous blast furnaces last year, is accelerating the construction of steelmaking converters. The province plans to build and renovate forty-two three-ton converters this year. From May to the end of August, twenty-eight have already been built and renovated and put into production. The remaining ones are being built at an accelerated pace. After these converters are put into production, the annual production capacity will be 630,000 tons, which is more than six times the province's original steelmaking capacity.

In May of this year, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on the province to build converters with the same determination and drive as last year in building small indigenous blast furnaces, and to strive to overfulfill this year's steel production plan. An important experience of Anhui's construction of small indigenous blast furnaces last year was: unified leadership, unified command, and, on the premise of giving priority to ensuring the completion of the state-allocated product manufacturing, concentrating the province's mechanical force and concentrating raw materials to first ensure the equipment production of small blast furnaces. In May of this year, the Provincial Party Committee decided to draw on this experience to accelerate the construction of converters. The Provincial Party Committee's Industrial Secretary personally led the work and established a steel plant construction headquarters to unify the command of the province's converter equipment supporting and construction work. The cities where steel plants were being built established corresponding organizations. The headquarters was attended by the main leaders of the metallurgical, mechanical manufacturing, materials supply, construction and installation departments, and led by the Provincial Party Secretary. Therefore, problems related to the converter construction, such as drawing review, equipment manufacturing, material supply, construction and installation, could be quickly resolved.

In terms of equipment manufacturing, except for a few major equipment allocated by the central government and collaborating with Shanghai, the remaining equipment for the forty-two converters was manufactured by the province. In view of the fact that converter equipment has many large parts, large processing volume, high technical requirements, but small batches, Anhui Province decided that general-purpose equipment should be arranged by the whole province, and other equipment should be solved locally. General-purpose equipment for converters, such as air compressors, motors, and high-pressure water pumps, has high technical requirements, and it is difficult and time-consuming for various places to manufacture them separately, so the province unified the arrangement and organized professional factories to manufacture them. Other equipment, such as furnace shells, iron melting furnaces, and molten steel ladles, not only have many varieties, but some equipment is large and bulky, and it is difficult to arrange transportation throughout the province and cannot be quickly matched, so the local area is responsible for manufacturing them. However, the Provincial Headquarters also directly assigned tasks to factories for these equipment, sent drawings to factories, and distributed materials to factories, which greatly accelerated the equipment manufacturing time. The order in which mechanical factories across the province manufacture equipment is based on the order of installation. For example, when installing converters, the tilting equipment is installed first, and the mechanical factory first manufactures the tilting equipment. The province's mechanical strength is relatively weak, and the equipment is poor. Many converter equipment has never been manufactured before, and it is necessary to organize cooperation among factories. Therefore, the headquarters specifically established a dispatching room to strengthen the equipment collaboration and supporting work.

In terms of construction and installation, Anhui Province, in the spirit of "early construction, early installation, early production, ensuring quality, economy, and safety," adopted the method of staggering the construction of the main workshop and auxiliary workshop for civil engineering projects, and staggering civil engineering and installation. The steel plant also implemented a unified leadership. With the steel plant as the main body, the construction and installation departments participated in the establishment of a headquarters, with division of labor and mutual cooperation. The Provincial Party Committee Steel Plant built a steelmaking workshop with four three-ton converters in just over two months from construction to installation.

Anhui Province also adopted the method of relying on the masses to clear warehouses, save, substitute, manufacture and adjust to solve the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and many required specifications and varieties. (Attached picture)

    安徽建转炉　领导决心大　劳动组织好
    四个月二十八座转炉投入生产
    本报讯　安徽省吸取去年建设小洋高炉的经验，加快炼钢转炉建设。全省今年计划新建和改建三吨转炉四十二个，从5月到8月底，已经建成和改好二十八个，投入了生产。其余正加紧建设。这些转炉投入生产后，年产能力为六十三万吨，等于全省原有炼钢能力的六倍多。
    今年5月，中共安徽省委就号召全省以去年建设小洋高炉的决心和干劲来建设转炉，力争超额完成今年钢的生产计划。去年安徽建设小洋高炉的重要经验是：统一领导，统一指挥，在优先保证完成国家分配产品制造前提下，集中全省机械力量，集中原材料，首先保证小高炉的设备生产。今年5月，省委便决定吸取这一经验，加快转炉的建设。省委工业书记亲自领导，并成立钢厂建设指挥部，统一指挥全省的转炉设备配套和建设工作。各建设钢厂的市，成立了相应的组织。指挥部由冶金、机械制造、物资供应、建筑安装等部门的主要负责人参加，省委书记领导，因此有关转炉建设的图纸审查、设备制造、材料供应、建筑安装等问题，都能很快解决。
    在设备制造方面，四十二个转炉除少数主要设备由中央分配和与上海协作外，其余设备都由本省制造。根据转炉设备的大件多，加工量大，技术要求高，但批量少的情况，安徽省确定通用设备由全省安排，其他设备就地解决。转炉的通用设备如空气压缩机、电动机、高压水泵等，技术要求高，各地分散制造有困难，时间慢，便由全省统一安排，组织专业厂制造。其他设备如炉壳、化铁炉、钢水包等，不仅品种多，有些设备大而笨重，由全省安排，运输有困难，而且不能很快配套的，由地方包干制造。但这些设备也由省指挥部把任务直接分配到厂，图纸送到厂，材料分到厂，这就大大加快了设备的制造时间。全省各机械厂制造设备的先后次序是根据安装先后次序进行的，如安装转炉，先装倾动设备，机械厂首先制造倾动设备。全省机械力量比较薄弱，设备差，转炉的很多设备从未制造过，必须组织各厂协作。因此，指挥部专门成立调度室，加强设备的协作配套工作。
    在建筑安装方面，安徽省本着“早建、早安、早生产，保证质量，节约、安全”的精神，采取了土建工程的主厂房与副厂房交错进行，土建与安装交错进行的办法。钢厂还实行了一元化领导。以钢厂为主，由建筑、安装部门参加，成立指挥部，分工负责，互相协作，省委钢铁厂，从施工到安装完毕，只用两个多月时间，就建成了有四个三吨转炉的炼钢车间。
    安徽省还采取依靠群众清仓、节约，代用，制造和调剂的办法，解决原材料不足、规格品种要求多的困难。（附图片）
