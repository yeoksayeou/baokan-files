Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 17th. While reaping a great agricultural harvest this year, the rural areas of Sichuan have launched a competition aimed at achieving a great rapeseed harvest next year. Currently, the increase production and practice economy movement in the vast Sichuan Basin is being further enhanced, and the masses are even more motivated. The province-wide rapeseed sowing and seedling cultivation work is rapidly and comprehensively underway.

Sichuan Province is one of China's major rapeseed producing areas. Since the Great Leap Forward, rapeseed production here has advanced by leaps and bounds. This year, brilliant achievements have been made with an increase of about 40% compared to last year, and the yield per unit area has jumped to the forefront of the country. During the bumper harvest, high-yield rapeseed counties such as Zhongxian, Xindu, Mianzhu, and Xinfan, as well as a large number of high-yield rapeseed communes and teams, emerged. The province has accumulated rich rapeseed cultivation experience, providing very favorable conditions for the continued leap forward in rapeseed production next year.

The competition to strive for a great rapeseed harvest next year started very intensely and enthusiastically. Zhongxian and Mianzhu, which hold the red flag for high rapeseed yields in the province, jointly challenged Xindu County and proposed to all counties in the province to launch a competition. The two counties proposed: actively expand the rapeseed planting area, increase the yield per unit area, and strive to increase the total rapeseed output next year by one to two times compared to this year. To ensure the realization of this plan, the two counties mobilized the masses from top to bottom to study and formulate production increase measures, requiring the implementation of rational close planting as the center, using fine varieties, timely sowing and transplanting, adhering to deep plowing of about one foot, applying heavy base fertilizer, rational topdressing, and doing a good job in preventing and controlling diseases and insects, as well as doing a good job in drainage and irrigation, which were effective measures last year. While proposing the competition, Zhongxian has already trained two thousand rapeseed technicians and is vigorously engaged in deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation and production. Since late August, the county has mobilized 60,000 people every day to plow all the rapeseed fields, and the sowing work has now been basically completed. Under the impetus of these high-yield rapeseed counties, many regions and counties in the province, communes and communes, and teams and teams have also launched opponent competitions and chain competitions with the aim of striving for a bumper harvest of small spring crops such as rapeseed, so that this competition has rapidly spread throughout the province.

Summarizing and promoting the experience of rapeseed bumper harvest this year and learning from the experience of advanced regions have become a remarkable activity in this competition. Many places sent representatives to Zhongxian, Xindu and other places to study and visit. From mountainous areas to plains, the experience of timely and early sowing and transplanting created by Zhongxian has been widely promoted. Chengkou County in the high mountainous area started in early August, and by the end of August, more than half of the planned sowing area had been completed. The western Sichuan Plain, which used to have a late season, also started comprehensively as soon as the "Chushu" (End of Heat) solar term passed, nearly a month earlier than last year. Many places in Neijiang, Wenjiang, Ya'an and other prefectures have also widely used the experience of cultivating large rapeseed plants in Zhongxian to vigorously carry out the movement of everyone using open spaces and barren slopes to plant "Rapeseed Kings". Some high-yield counties modestly learn from other places to supplement their lack of experience. For example, Zhongxian has decided to learn from Xindu's method of applying sufficient base fertilizer and rational topdressing. The county's 45,000 mu of rapeseed fields have recently been fertilized at an average rate of more than 7,000 jin per mu.

The competition has greatly promoted the province's rapeseed sowing work and transplanting preparations. Early planning, early action, high quality, and fast progress have become prominent features of Sichuan's rapeseed sowing from the beginning. In Xindu County, rapeseed sowing generally achieves deep plowing and multiple harrowing, careful selection of fine varieties, sufficient base fertilizer, and deep drainage. In Qingju District of Nanchong, the seedling cultivation of each commune in two days accounted for a quarter of the planned area. The seedling beds are all good land with good drainage, good soil, and sufficient fertilizer. After inspection, they all meet the technical specifications for seedling cultivation. Various places have taken the method of plowing the fields and applying fertilizer while harvesting middle rice to speed up the sowing progress. Now, the rapeseed sowing task in general areas has been more than half completed.

This newspaper reports that, encouraged by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, the vast number of cadres, officers and soldiers, teachers and students of schools, and urban residents in Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan, have widely launched a movement in which each person cultivates ten "Rapeseed King" plants, striving to produce one jin of rapeseed per plant.

The work of cultivating Rapeseed Kings is carried out simultaneously with vegetable planting. They are mostly planted in some open spaces and barren areas within agencies. At present, soil cultivation and seedling cultivation are underway in various places. The cadres of the Neijiang Prefectural Party Committee have sown rapeseed seeds around their residences that can be planted on an area equivalent to eighteen mu of fields, and they will be transplanted soon. After leveling, the seedling cultivation sites of various agencies, troops, and schools in Jianyang County have also been fertilized in a timely manner. In order to enable the large rapeseed plants cultivated by various agencies, troops, and schools in Rongxian County to obtain the expected high yield, they paid great attention to making the work solid and meticulous when preparing the land, and some also decided to apply 600 jin of fertilizer to each rapeseed plant.

While urban cadres and residents are cultivating large rapeseed plants, the vast number of farmers in Neijiang Prefecture are more actively using barren slopes and other non-arable land to cultivate large rapeseed plants. It is estimated that the output of large rapeseed plants planted on non-arable land in the entire prefecture will be equivalent to one-third of the prefecture's rapeseed output this year.

    今年抓明年  丰收再丰收
    四川开展油菜多种高产竞赛
    内江专区机关部队学校人人培植十窝大油菜
    新华社成都17日电　四川农村在夺取今年农业大丰收的同时，一个以争取明年油菜大丰收为内容的竞赛运动又已形成。目前，千里盆地的增产节约运动锦上添花，广大群众干劲倍增。全省油菜播种育苗工作迅速全面展开。
    四川省是我国油菜子主要产区之一。大跃进以来，这里油菜生产突飞猛进。今年取得了比去年增产四成左右的辉煌成绩，单位面积产量已跃居全国前列。大丰收中还出现了忠县、新都、绵竹、新繁等油菜高产县和大量的油菜高产社、队。全省积累了丰富的油菜培植经验，为明年油菜生产继续跃进提供了十分有利的条件。
    以争取明年油菜大丰收为内容的竞赛，一开始就十分紧张热烈。高举全省油菜高产红旗的忠县和绵竹，联合向新都县提出挑战，并向全省各县倡议开展竞赛。两县提出：积极扩大油菜种植面积，提高单位面积产量，力争明年油菜总产量比今年增产一倍到一倍以上。为了保证这一计划实现，两县从上到下深入发动群众研究和制订了增产措施，要求以推行合理密植为中心，采用良种，适时播种和移栽，坚持深耕一尺左右，重施底肥，合理追肥以及做好防治病虫、做好排灌等去年行之有效的措施。忠县在提出竞赛同时，已经训练了两千名油菜技术员，大搞深翻地和积肥造肥。8月下旬以来，全县每天出动六万人，翻耕了全部油菜田，目前已基本完成播种工作。在这几个油菜高产县带动下，全省许多地区县与县、公社与公社、队与队也都以争取小春油菜等作物丰收为内容，开展了对手竞赛和连环竞赛，使这一竞赛迅速遍及全省。
    总结推广今年油菜丰产经验，学习先进地区经验，成为这次竞赛中引人注目的一项活动。许多地方派出代表到忠县、新都等地学习访问。从山区到平原，普遍推广了忠县创造的适时提早播种和栽插的经验。高山区城口县8月上旬就开始动手，8月底计划播种面积就已经完成一半以上。过去季节迟的川西平原也在“处暑”一过就全面动手，比去年提早近一个月。内江、温江、雅安等专区许多地方还广泛运用忠县培植大株油菜的经验，大力开展人人利用空地荒坡种“油菜王”的运动。有些高产县虚心向外地学习，以补自己经验的不足。例如忠县就决定学习新都施足底肥合理追肥的办法，全县四万五千亩油菜田在最近每亩平均施肥达七千斤以上。
    竞赛大大推动了全省油菜播种工作和移栽准备。规划早、行动早、质量高、进度快，成为今年四川油菜播种一开始就表现出的突出特点。新都县已播油菜一般都做到深翻多耙，精选良种，施足底肥，深放排水等。南充青居区各公社两天育苗就占计划面积四分之一，苗床都是排水好、土壤好、施肥足的好地，经检查都合乎育苗技术规格。各地采取边收中稻、边犁田的方法及时深翻和施肥，加快播种进度。现在一般地区的油菜播种任务已完成一半以上。
    本报讯　在党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议的鼓舞下，四川内江专区广大机关干部、部队官兵、学校师生以及城镇居民，都广泛开展了一个每人培植十窝“油菜王”的运动，争取每窝产一斤油菜子。
    培育油菜王的工作是与栽种蔬菜同时进行的。它们多被选择在机关内的一些空地和荒坪、荒坡上栽种。现在，各地都正在进行培土和育苗工作。中共内江地委机关干部在住地周围已经播下了可以栽相当于十八亩田面积的油菜种子，不久就可以移栽。简阳县各个机关、部队、学校的育苗地经过平整以后，也都及时施足了肥料。荣县各机关、部队、学校为了使培育的大株油菜，能获得预期的高产，在整地时，都十分注意把活路做踏实、细致，有的还决定给每窝油菜施六百斤肥料。
    在城镇机关干部、居民培育大株油菜的同时，内江专区广大农民更积极利用荒坡、荒坪等非耕地，培育大株油菜。预计全专区利用非耕地种植的大株油菜的产量可相当于全区今年油菜产量的三分之一。
