    篮球决赛第三轮战况
    新华社6日讯　全国运动会篮球决赛今天进行了第三轮比赛。解放军、北京和四川队的男、女队仍然保持不败纪录，两战两胜的江苏男队在第三轮败给北京男队。
    第三轮的全部比赛结果，男子队是：解放军胜吉林（一百零三比七十二）；北京胜江苏（九十五比七十五）；四川胜辽宁（八十一比七十二）；河北胜黑龙江（七十二比六十三）；广东胜上海（八十九比八十七）；陕西胜湖北（八十八比六十六）。女子队是：解放军胜吉林（五十七比四十六）；北京胜江苏（六十六比四十六）；四川胜云南（六十九比五十七）；河北胜山西（七十二比五十一）；广东胜上海（六十七比四十四）；贵州胜湖北（五十七比五十五）。
    江苏男队在前两轮打得很出色，今天首遇北京男队，攻击力也十分凌厉。上半场北京队首开纪录，四平以后，江苏队一直领先三分到五分，直到最后的一分多钟，北京队展开快攻，连进五球，才以四十比四十五落后。下半场北京队王忆诚、陶传孝中距离投篮有投皆中，高个子中锋鞠汾康又活跃篮下，里应外合，江苏队虽拼力防守和组织快速反攻，仍不免败下阵来。
    篮球决赛7日和8日两天休息，9日，解放军、北京和四川的男、女队，将分别与江苏、河北和上海的男、女队交锋。这六场比赛预料将是决赛开始以来最激烈的战斗。
