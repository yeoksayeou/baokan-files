    Poisonous Fungus in a Stagnant Pond
    ——On the Bulgarian Film "On the Eve of Appointment"

    In celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, we were pleased to appreciate the excellent Bulgarian film "On the Eve of Appointment," which premiered in our country.
    This satirical comedy is adapted from the comedy "Golimanov" by the famous Bulgarian writer Stefan Kostov. Through Golimanov, who dreamed of becoming a minister and exhausted all卑鄙无耻 (despicable and shameless) means but ended up with nothing, the film portrays various characters in the old society who schemed against each other for fame and fortune, revealing their dirty souls.
    Golimanov's philosophy of life is: in order to achieve the goal of climbing up, any means can be used. When he heard the news of the minister's death, he was overjoyed and went crazy. He cheered that the dead man had made way for him, and he could climb up. He even swore that he must succeed, "even if it means the destruction of his family!" In order to curry favor with the Prime Minister's wife, he even went to the countryside to find someone to "build a bridge"; in order to please the Prime Minister's wife, he instructed his hangers-on to forcibly seize other people's rose oil, and even after being rejected by the Prime Minister's wife, he continued to flatter and fawn.
    The film exposes Golimanov's ugly mask. He is clearly obsessed with profit, but he talks about "serving the people and sacrificing himself"; he colludes with other people in society to praise each other and carry out election activities. Through these descriptions, the film reveals the dirty fig leaf of the upper class, allowing us to see some hypocrites of various kinds. For example, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Sikov, would publish articles praising whoever paid him more; for example, those boring and shameless politicians in the club who listened to the host Golimanov exaggerating himself on the stage, but were thinking about coffee and lemonade, and perhaps even wine. Through this fierce battle for "minister," the film fully reflects the ugly essence of the bourgeois upper class: self-centeredness, mutual exploitation, and mutual infighting. Old Grandma Gishka's metaphor of people as bears is precisely a rebuke to those昏愦庸俗 (muddle-headed and vulgar) people; her sharp laughter is to tear apart that sinful world!
    The mayor and principal who came to Golimanov for donations to build a library in their hometown were very appropriately arranged by the author to reappear before the final climax of the film, so that people would have a more lasting aftertaste after leaving the cinema. They came to offer congratulations to the "minister" who was about to "take office," hoping that Golimanov would generously donate, but unexpectedly Golimanov took out a photo of himself as a young teacher as a return gift, wanting them to take it back as a "permanent memorial," "which can be used to educate young people, so that everyone knows that only like me can one rise step by step until today as a minister!" In this way, the spiritual world of Golimanov, a man obsessed with officialdom and greedy for money, is further revealed.
    The phone call about the sudden resignation of the cabinet shattered Golimanov's dream of becoming a "minister." Under this comedic climax, Golimanov fell, and he fell painfully and hard! The author used this to mercilessly鞭挞 (lash out at) these filthy souls.
    In capitalist society, such comedies are constantly being staged with new tricks, but they have disappeared forever in the countries of the people's regime. After watching this film, we understand even more why the Bulgarian people are so eager for a free, democratic, and socialist life, and curse the eternal demise of capitalism!

    死水塘里的毒菌
    ——谈保加利亚影片“上任前夕”
    萧吟
    在庆祝保加利亚人民共和国成立十五周年的时候，我们满意地欣赏了在我国首映的保加利亚优秀影片“上任前夕”。
    这部讽刺喜剧片是根据保加利亚著名作家斯梯芬·柯托夫的喜剧“戈里马诺夫”改编摄制的。影片通过一个朝思暮想当部长使尽了一切卑鄙无耻的手段却落得一场空的戈里马诺夫，刻划了旧社会为名利为钱财尔虞我诈、明争暗斗的各色人物，揭开了他们龌龊的灵魂。
    戈里马诺夫的人生哲学是：为了达到向上爬的目的，可以不择手段。他听到部长死了的消息，高兴得发疯了，他欢呼这是死人给他让出了一条路，他可以爬上去了。他甚至宣誓非成功不可，“哪怕家破人亡，也在所不惜！”为了巴结上首相夫人，他还特意到乡下找人来“搭桥”；为了讨好首相夫人，他指使他的帮闲强夺了别人的玫瑰油，甚至尝了首相夫人的闭门羹还要继续谄媚巴结。
    影片揭露了戈里马诺夫丑恶的假面具。明明是利禄熏心，却满口“为人民效劳，不惜牺牲自己”；拉拢社会上的其他一些来互相吹捧，进行竞选活动。通过这些描写，影片向我们揭开了上层社会肮脏的遮羞布，让我们看到一些形形色色的伪君子们。例如报社主笔西考夫，谁给得钱多，他就登捧谁的文章；例如那些在俱乐部里听东道主戈里马诺夫在讲台上自我扩张、心里却在想着咖啡和柠檬水、想着也许还会有酒喝的无聊而又无耻的政客们。影片通过这一场激烈的“部长”争夺战，充分反映了资产阶级上层社会，自我中心，互相利用，彼此倾轧的丑恶本质。片中人吉什卡老奶奶把人喻为狗熊，就正是对那些昏愦庸俗小人们的斥责；她那尖厉的笑声，就是要把那个罪恶的世界撕裂！
    为了家乡建立图书馆，想来求助于戈里马诺夫捐款的市长和校长，作者极其恰当地把他们安排在影片最后的一个高潮来到之前重新出场，好让人们在离开电影院之后有着更隽永的回味。他们来为行将“上任”的“部长”致祝词，企望戈里马诺夫会慷慨解囊捐助，但竟意想不到戈里马诺夫取出一帧年青时代当教员的照片作为回礼，想让他们带回去作个“永久纪念”，“可以用来教育青年，使所有的人知道，唯有像我这样，方才能够步步高升直到今天当部长！”这样，就更深入一层地再揭示了戈里马诺夫这个官迷心窍、爱财如命的人物的精神世界。
    内阁突然总辞职的电话，使戈里马诺夫的“部长”之梦顿成泡影。在这个喜剧性高潮之下，戈里马诺夫摔下来了，摔得痛，也摔得狠！作者就是给这些龌龊的灵魂以无情的鞭挞。
    在资本主义社会里，这样的喜剧正层出不穷、花样翻新地演出，但是它在人民政权的国家已一去不复返了。看了这部影片，让我们更加理解保加利亚人民为什么这样渴望自由民主的社会主义的生活，诅咒资本主义的永远灭亡！
