    We can certainly straighten the question mark
  　Liu Junde
    To put the No. 1 coke oven into production ten months ahead of schedule, and the No. 1 blast furnace into production nine months ahead of schedule – this was the grand ambition that the workers building the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) made to the motherland in May of last year. At the time, some journalists from capitalist countries who were visiting China did not believe it. Not long after, both furnaces were put into production ahead of schedule according to the workers' will. The workers humorously said: We straightened the question mark in their hearts, turning it into an exclamation mark! (Red Flag, 1959, Issue 13)
    Recently, we have seen news that WISCO's No. 3 large coke oven and No. 2 large blast furnace have been put into production. These two furnaces were built at an even faster speed. The construction of No. 1 blast furnace took fourteen months and twelve days, while No. 2 blast furnace took only four months and twenty days, and the project quality is very good. This fact will cause "!!!" three times the exclamation marks to appear in the hearts of those journalists from capitalist countries.
    "Straighten the '?' mark," this magnificent and resounding slogan contains infinite power, confidence, and determination, and expresses the heroic spirit of the working class. Only today, when the workers and peasants and the laboring masses have become masters of the country, can they express the heartfelt wish of "We want to create miracles, and we can definitely do it."
    On our road forward, we will create thousands of miracles, and of course, we will encounter difficulties of all sizes. Those old gentlemen who doubt that our cause can be victorious will also release all kinds of "?" marks to scare us. However, under the leadership of the Party, the industrious, brave, ingenious, and intelligent Chinese people will certainly be able to straighten all kinds of "?" marks one by one, turning them into a broad road composed of big and thick "!" marks, leading directly to a happy communist society.

    一定能把“？”号拉直
  　刘钧德
    要一号焦炉提前十个月、一号高炉提前九个月投入生产——这是建设武钢的工人们在去年5月向祖国立下的宏愿大志。当时，在我国访问的一些资本主义国家的记者们却不相信。事隔不久，这两座炉子都按照工人的意志提前投入生产了，工人们幽默地说：咱们把他们心上的“？”号拉直了，使它变成了“！”号。（红旗1959年13期）
    最近，我们又看到了武钢的三号大型焦炉，二号大型高炉投入生产的消息，这两个炉子是用更快的速度建设起来的，建设一号高炉前后共用十四个月零十二天，而二号高炉只用了四个月零二十天，工程质量十分良好。这个事实，将在那些资本主义国家的记者们的心上会出现“！！！”三倍的惊叹号。
    “把‘？’号拉直”，这个宏壮响亮的口号，包含着无穷的力量、信心和决心，它表达了工人阶级的英雄气概。只有在今天，工农劳动群众做了国家的主人，才能说出“我们要创造奇迹，而且一定能办到”的心声。
    在我们前进的道路上，要创造千千万万的奇迹，当然也会遭遇大大小小的困难，那些怀疑我们的事业能取得胜利的老爷先生们，也就会放出形形色色的“？”号来，吓唬我们。但是，勤劳勇敢机智聪明的中国人民，在党的领导下，一定能把形形色色的“？”号一个个拉直，变成一条由又大又粗的“！”号所组成的康庄大道，一直通向幸福的共产主义社会。
