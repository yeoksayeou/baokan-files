China's Track and Field Sports Develop Rapidly
Zong He
Track and field sports include running, jumping, walking, and throwing events. It is the foundation of all sports and the most effective means to comprehensively cultivate and exercise people's speed, strength, agility, and endurance. Any athlete, if they can run fast and jump high, will find it easier to master techniques and deploy tactics. Therefore, the improvement of track and field levels directly impacts the improvement of all sports levels. After liberation, under the care and leadership of the Party and the government, China's track and field sports have greatly developed. In particular, the national Labor and Defense System, which lists track and field as an important component, has been warmly welcomed by the masses, especially young people. The implementation of the "Labor and Defense System" has even more powerfully promoted the development of track and field sports and the improvement of technical levels.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the technical level of China's track and field sports was extremely backward. The results of many events were only equivalent to the level of current second-class athletes, especially women's records were even lower. For example, the 100m and 200m sprints and high jump were only equivalent to the standards of third-class athletes. As for the 80m hurdles and javelin, shot put, discus, and other events, the results were much worse than the current third-class athlete standards. The speed of improvement was also extremely slow. From 1936 to 1948, in dozens of men's and women's track and field events, national records were only changed ten times. After liberation, track and field sports have improved rapidly. From 1953 to 1954, in just one year, Chinese male and female track and field athletes created 72 national records, exceeding the nine changes to seven records during the thirteen years from 1936 to 1948 by eight times. From January to mid-August this year, Chinese male and female track and field athletes broke 22 of last year's national records, exceeding half of the 43 men's and women's track and field single-event national records. Some events have approached world levels, such as women's high jump, men's pole vault, and marathon. Now, we have left the pre-liberation track and field records far behind.

In international competitions, China's outstanding track and field athletes have also won glory for the motherland. Jiang Yumin, the national record holder for women's 100m, 200m, and 400m sprints, won third place in the women's 100m sprint and second place in the women's 200m sprint at the 10th Bucharest International Track and Field Championships in 1957. At the 11th Bucharest International Track and Field Championships, Wen Yunzhen won the silver medal in the 80m hurdles; Liu Xingyu won third place in the women's long jump with a jump of 5.83 meters. Zheng Fengrong has consistently ranked among the top in various international competitions. Yang Yumin defeated fourteen opponents at the Rosicky Memorial International Track and Field Meet this year and won first place in the women's long jump; Zhou Lianli won the silver medal in the 110m hurdles at the 11th International Track and Field Championships in 1958, and won the championship in the same event at the first International Military Sports Council Games of Socialist Countries that same year, and won the championship again in the 110m hurdles at the Rosicky Memorial International Track and Field Meet this year.

On the basis of the widespread development of mass sports, the reserve force of track and field sports is constantly growing. Currently, tens of thousands of young athletes are studying in track and field classes at youth amateur sports schools across the country. Under the guidance of teachers, they are engaged in systematic and hard training. The continuous emergence of new forces will make China's track and field sports even more splendid.

The convening of the first National Games is a grand review of China's sports over the past ten years, and it is also a grand review in track and field. This time, track and field athletes from all over the country are gathering together, all full of enthusiasm, and undoubtedly, some good results will appear. In the past few days of competition, athletes such as Jiang Yumin, Qi Dechang, Huang Zhiyong, Su Wenren, and Huo Tianshun have broken the national records in events such as the women's 400m, men's decathlon, and 5000m respectively. For other events that have not yet started, such as the men's 100m, there are 83 participants in the preliminaries, including many talented athletes. In the preliminary rounds on the 14th, the results were not ideal. Liu Jingren, Chen Jiaquan, Gao Zhengquan, and others, who had previously run 10.6 seconds, did not perform at their best. There are still two opportunities in the semi-finals and finals, and there is still hope to break 10.6 seconds. In the men's 10,000m race, Su Wenren, the national record holder for the 10,000m and 5,000m in 1958, as well as Huo Tianshun, Zhao Baorong, Zheng Zhaoxin, and other talented athletes are participating, and it is very likely that the 30-minute mark will be broken in the 10,000m.

There are now eight people who can jump over or exceed 4.10 meters in the pole vault. Cai Yishu's result reached 4.47 meters. With a little more effort, the result can be further improved. In addition, there are two men who can jump over 2 meters in the high jump, and seven or eight people who can jump over 1.90 meters; more than 20 women can jump over 1.40 meters in the high jump, and five can jump over 1.60 meters. These events are expected to unfold fiercely and produce good results.

Through this National Games, China's track and field level, like other sports, will be further advanced.

Of course, the current achievements of China's track and field sports are still not high, and there is still a certain distance from the world level, requiring Chinese track and field athletes to make greater efforts. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, by diligently learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, coupled with the athletes' soaring enthusiasm and dedicated research, China's track and field sports will surely continue to leap forward on the existing foundation.

    我国田径运动发展迅速
    宗和
    田径运动包括跑、跳、竞走、投掷等项目。它是各项运动的基础，是全面培养和锻炼人们的速度、力量、灵敏和耐力最有效的手段。任何项目的运动员，如果跑得快，跳得高，他就更易于掌握技术，发挥战术，因此，田径运动水平的提高就直接影响到各项运动水平的提高。解放后，在党和政府的关怀和领导下，我国田径运动有了很大的开展。特别是国家颁布的劳卫制把田径列为其中的重要内容，受到广大群众，特别是青年的热烈欢迎。“劳卫制”的推行，更加有力地推动了田径运动的开展和技术水平的提高。
    在国民党反动派统治时期，我国田径运动的技术水平十分落后，有不少项目成绩只相当于现在二级运动员的水平，特别是女子纪录更低，像一、二百米跑、跳高等只相当于三级运动员标准，至于八十米低栏和标枪、铅球、铁饼等项的成绩比现在的三级运动员标准还差不少。提高的速度也极为缓慢。从1936年到1948年的十几年中，在男、女几十个田径项目中，只改变过十次全国纪录。解放后，田径运动有了飞速提高。从1953年到1954年，仅仅一年的时间，我国男、女田径运动员就创造了七十二次全国纪录，超过了1936年到1948年的十三年间、改变七项九次纪录的八倍。今年1月到8月中旬，我国男女田径选手又打破了二十二项去年的全国纪录，超过了四十三个男、女田径单项全国纪录的一半。有的项目已经接近了世界水平。如女子跳高、男子撑竿跳和马拉松等。现在，我们已经把解放前的田径纪录远远地抛在后面了。
    在国际比赛中，我国优秀田径运动员也为祖国争得了荣誉。女子一百、二百、四百米跑全国纪录保持者姜玉民，在1957年第十届布加勒斯特国际田径锦标赛中，获得女子百米跑第三名和女子二百米跑第二名；在第十一届布加勒斯特国际田径锦标赛中，八十米低栏选手文蕴珍获得亚军；刘兴玉以五点八三米获女子跳远第三名。郑凤荣在历次国际比赛中都曾名列前茅。杨玉敏在今年举行的纪念罗西茨基国际田径赛中战胜十四个对手，荣获女子跳远第一名；1958年第十一届国际田径赛中，周连立获一百一十米高栏亚军，同年在第一届社会主义国家国际友军运动会获该项冠军，今年在纪念罗西茨基国际田径赛中，又获一百一十米高栏冠军。
    在群众性体育广泛开展的基础上，田径运动的后备力量正在不断成长。目前，在全国各地青少年业余体育学校田径班学习的青少年运动员数以万计，他们在教师们的指导下，进行系统的刻苦锻炼。新生力量的不断涌现，将使我国田径运动更加绚丽多采。
    第一次全国运动会的召开是对十年来我国体育运动的大检阅，在田径方面也同样是个大检阅。这次，各地田径好手云集，个个都干劲十足，无疑将会出现一些好成绩。在前几天的比赛中姜玉民、齐德昌、黄志勇、苏文仁、霍天顺等运动员分别打破了女子四百米、男子十项、五千米等项目的全国最高纪录。其他还没有比赛的像男子百米就有八十三人参加预赛，其中好手很多。在14日的预次赛中，成绩不够理想，刘敬仁、陈家全、高正铨等过去跑过十秒六的都未跑出最好水平来，还有复赛决赛两次机会，突破十秒六还是有希望的。男子万米比赛，1958年万米和五千米全国纪录保持者苏文仁以及霍天顺、赵宝荣、郑昭信等好手都参加，万米很有破三十分大关的可能。
    撑竿跳高能跳过和超过四米一十的现在已有八人，蔡艺墅的成绩达到四米四七，再加把劲，成绩还能提高。另外，男子跳高能跳过两米以上的有二人，跳过一米九十以上的有七、八人；女子跳高超过一米四十的有二十多人，能跳过一米六十的就有五人，这些项目，预计一定会展开激烈竞争，并会出现好成绩。
    通过这次全运会我国田径运动水平也同其他项目一样，将会向前推进一步。
    当然，我国田径运动的现有成绩还是不高的，离世界水平还有一定的距离，需要我国田径运动员付出更大的努力。我们相信在党的领导下，认真学习苏联和其它兄弟国家的先进经验，加上运动员的冲天干劲和刻苦钻研，我国的田径运动必将在现有的基础上，继续向前跃进。
