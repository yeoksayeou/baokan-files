The Great Victory of Socialist Transformation of Handicraft Industry in China
Deputy Minister of Light Industry and Director of All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives, Deng Jie

China's handicraft industry is highly developed, with a long history and a broad mass base. It is closely related to social production and people's lives, occupying a significant position in the national economy. Its industries are numerous, and its products are diverse, ranging from simple and small items like hairpins and shoe eyelets to tables, chairs, benches, various farm implements and tools, construction materials, as well as clothing, hats, shoes, socks, and many traditional famous brand products that enjoy high reputation both at home and abroad, numbering in the tens of thousands. As for exquisite, magnificent, and artistically crafted items with national styles and local features, they are precious heritages of the motherland's culture. The production and management of handicrafts are also very flexible, including batch production in fixed workshops, flexible processing, renovation, and repair, as well as street vending and mobile services, which can fully adapt to the dispersed, complex, ever-changing, seasonal, and varied social needs.

Since the individual handicraft industry is a small-commodity economy based on small private ownership, the relations of production restrict the development of the productive forces and have a spontaneous tendency towards capitalism. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation to completely liberate the productive forces and give full play to its positive role in the national economy, and to guide the broad masses of handicraft workers to gradually get rid of poverty and embark on the broad road to happiness and prosperity.

As early as the eve of the nationwide liberation in 1949, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party clearly pointed out that the individual handicraft industry must gradually develop towards modernization and collectivization. After the nationwide liberation, the Party and the government actively supported handicraft production on the one hand, and conducted typical trials on the other, guiding the individual handicraft industry to develop towards collectivization in a step-by-step manner. By 1952, the last year of the period of national economic recovery, the number of handicraft workers nationwide had increased from 5,855,000 in 1949 to 7,364,000, and the output value had increased from 3.23 billion yuan in 1949 to 7.32 billion yuan, reaching 96.6% of the highest annual output value before liberation—that of 1936. The number of handicraft cooperatives nationwide had grown to 2,678, with 250,000 members and an annual output value of 250 million yuan.

In 1953, China entered the period of the First Five-Year Plan for national economic construction. The Party put forward the general line for the transitional period and regarded the socialist transformation of the handicraft industry as one of the components of the general line. Since then, China's handicraft cooperative movement has entered a stage of universal development. In order to guide the broad masses of handicraft workers to consciously organize themselves, the Party put forward the policy of "active leadership, steady progress," adhered to the principles of voluntarism and mutual benefit, and adopted the methods of persuasion, demonstration, and state assistance. It adopted three organizational forms suitable for the masses' level of awareness and production needs—handicraft supply and marketing production groups, supply and marketing production cooperatives, and production cooperatives—starting with supply and marketing, implementing social transformation and production transformation, from small to large, from low to high, and gradually organizing the handicraft workers. By the end of 1954, the number of handicraft cooperatives (groups) nationwide had grown to more than 41,000, with more than 1,130,000 members, and an annual output value of 1.16 billion yuan. In the first half of 1955, handicraft cooperatives in various regions successively launched a rectification campaign centered on strengthening socialist education, opposing capitalist management ideology and style, purifying internal organization, rectifying the direction of management, and vigorously implementing the principles of democratic management and thrift. Therefore, the handicraft cooperative organizations were further consolidated ideologically and organizationally.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on the question of agricultural cooperation in the second half of 1955, agricultural cooperation first entered a high tide. In January 1956, under the impetus and influence of the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce, a vigorous upsurge of cooperation also emerged in the handicraft industry. During the upsurge, approximately 3 million people joined handicraft cooperatives, bringing the total number organized before the upsurge to more than 5 million. In addition, farmers engaged in commodity handicraft production and some individual handicraft workers scattered in the countryside joined agricultural cooperatives. A small number of individual handicrafts and capitalist handicraft industries closely related to industry and commerce participated in joint state-private enterprises and were transformed along with private industry and commerce. In this way, the task of transforming the handicraft industry from individual private ownership to collective ownership has been basically completed.

After the vigorous nationwide cooperation upsurge in 1956 and timely consolidation, the economic foundation for the generation of capitalism was destroyed in the handicraft field, and the contradiction between the relations of production and the productive forces was overcome, creating a very important prerequisite for tapping the enormous potential of handicraft production. The tragic history of handicraft workers suffering oppression and exploitation for thousands of years has become a thing of the past.

After cooperation, China's handicraft industry has shown unparalleled advantages over individual economy: changing individual operation into collective operation, it can get rid of the control and exploitation of commercial capital and usurious capital from the very beginning, overcome the difficulties in supply and marketing and the threat of off-seasons, and realize normal production; it is further convenient to incorporate handicraft production into the state plan, implement overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, unified planning, and planned balance; changing individual labor into collective labor, it is convenient to implement division of labor and cooperation in production, organize labor reasonably according to the members' skill level and physical strength, and also can give play to individual expertise and collective wisdom, continuously improve tools and equipment, increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and expand public accumulation, so as to gradually realize semi-mechanization and mechanized production by self-reliance and self-arming; after being organized, the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, and the original feudal relations and exploitation relations in the handicraft industry have been replaced by new socialist, democratic, mutual assistance, and cooperative relations. At the same time, the traditional guild concepts and conservative ideas have been broken, and unity has been strengthened, and labor enthusiasm has been encouraged. Therefore, production has developed rapidly. In 1957, after the realization of cooperation, the total output value of the handicraft industry nationwide reached 13.3 billion yuan, an increase of more than threefold compared with 1949, exceeding the First Five-Year Plan by 13.6%, and an increase of 78% compared with the most prosperous era before liberation—1936. On the basis of production development, the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of handicraft workers have been continuously improved and raised. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the wages of members of handicraft production cooperatives increased by an average of 16.7% per year. Handicraft cooperatives have also established various labor protection and welfare facilities to varying degrees according to their own economic strength, such as public medical care, canteens, bathrooms, nurseries, etc., changing the phenomenon that handicraft workers had no support in old society for birth, old age, sickness, and death. Handicraft cooperatives have also provided extremely favorable conditions for members to study culture, held literacy classes, spare-time cultural schools, and technical training classes, organized clubs, troupes, sports teams, and other cultural, recreational, and sports organizations, so that many members have removed the label of illiteracy, improved their scientific and technological level, enhanced their physical fitness, and enriched their cultural lives. Through the road of cooperation, the broad masses of handicraft workers in China have since embarked on the broad road to civilized production and prosperous life.

In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the handicraft industry, like the entire industrial and agricultural production, saw an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. In this year, the total output value of the handicraft industry nationwide (including fishery, salt industry, and farmers' part-time commodity handicraft industry) was estimated at approximately 20 billion yuan, an increase of nearly 50% compared with 1957; of which, the handicraft cooperatives, together with the units that had already transitioned to factories, amounted to more than 14 billion yuan, an increase of nearly 70% compared with 1957. The growth rate far exceeded any year after liberation. The absolute value of the growth of the entire handicraft industry reached 7 billion yuan, exceeding the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan period. In terms of technological revolution, under the policy of fully mobilizing the masses, self-reliance, and self-arming, with the help and cooperation of the state, higher-level cooperatives, and relevant departments, handicraft cooperative organizations, starting with the reform of existing tools and equipment and the improvement of skills, adopted the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods, from indigenous to foreign, and manufactured various machinery and equipment by themselves. Many units gradually realized semi-mechanization or mechanized production. By the end of 1958, handicraft cooperative organizations nationwide had more than 120,000 sets of various mechanical and power equipment, and the output value of semi-mechanized and mechanized production reached more than 30% of the total output value, initially changing the backwardness of China's handicraft production. In particular, all members, employees, and cadres of handicraft cooperatives and factories enthusiastically participated in the great movement of all the people to make steel; and achieved great results in the process from small earthen furnaces to small blast furnaces. All these show the new vitality displayed by the handicraft industry on the basis of the victory of socialist transformation, in the process of implementing the general line.

With the tremendous development of production, new changes have also taken place in the relations of production in handicraft cooperatives. As early as the second half of 1956, the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party had already pointed out that "a part of the cooperative organizations will develop into state-owned enterprises or merge into state-owned enterprises under appropriate conditions; a part of the cooperative organizations will maintain the collective ownership of the means of production for a long time; and another part of the cooperative organizations will maintain the mode of operation of being responsible for their own profits and losses under the management of socialist enterprises." According to this policy, since the winter of 1956, various regions have conducted pilot work on the transition to factories in some old cooperatives with larger scale, more accumulation, and higher degree of mechanization. In 1958, under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially the large-scale development of industry in various regions and the communalization of rural people's communes, the transition of handicraft cooperatives to factories has entered a new stage of phased, batch-by-batch, and comprehensive promotion from individual pilot projects. According to the statistics in May 1959, among the more than 100,000 handicraft cooperatives with more than 5 million members nationwide, 37.8% have transitioned to local state-owned factories, 13.6% have transitioned to cooperative factories operated by handicraft joint cooperatives, 35.3% have transitioned to people's commune factories, and 13.3% still retain the form of cooperatives. After handicraft cooperatives are transformed into local state-owned factories and cooperative factories, the original cadres, funds, equipment, labor force, and technical strength can be uniformly adjusted and reasonably used on a larger scale, which is more convenient for the state to arrange production in a unified manner according to industry and fully utilize the foundation of the original handicraft cooperatives to develop local industry. Many units have also carried out economic reorganization and expansion and reconstruction, accelerating the process of technological revolution in the handicraft industry. After the rural handicraft cooperatives are transformed into people's commune factories, it is more conducive to the combination of industry and agriculture and to serve agricultural production.

Since 1958, the achievements in the leap-forward development of handicraft production and the profound changes in the relations of production have been tremendous. However, some areas did not pay enough attention to overall planning while transitioning handicraft cooperatives to factories and reorganizing the economy, squeezing out some small commodity production and repair service businesses. At the same time, due to the rapid growth of social purchasing power, some small handicraft commodities have appeared in short supply in the market. For these problems, the central and local party committees have begun to take measures since this spring. In the past few months, handicraft production has made great progress. A small number of products that have been shut down or reduced in production have resumed production, and many regions have also increased some new varieties according to people's needs, and seasonal commodities have been launched on the market one after another. Repair service businesses have also expanded and added many new service items, which have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

Ten years of transformation experience have proved that the handicraft industry is not only in the past, but also in the future, is an important department of the national economy. Some people think that "national industrialization means that the handicraft industry is dispensable," this idea is one-sided and incorrect. Modern large-scale industry is the foundation of the national economy, and it must be developed in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. However, while rapidly developing modern large-scale industry, it is also necessary to develop the production of small handicraft products; because large-scale industry cannot completely replace the handicraft industry. Therefore, while developing modern large-scale industry, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of handicraft production. Only in this way can we correctly implement the policy of walking on two legs, that is, running large, medium, and small industries simultaneously, and combining indigenous and foreign methods of production, as stipulated by the Party's general line for socialist construction.

Now, encouraged by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, under the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, a vigorous upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy is being carried out in handicraft cooperative factories and societies across the country. The broad masses of members and employees are advancing courageously in a fighting posture; determined to contribute all their strength and wisdom to accelerate the industrialization of the motherland and to strive to build socialism at an early date.

    我国手工业社会主义改造的伟大胜利
    轻工业部副部长  全国手工业合作总社主任  邓洁
    我国手工业非常发达。手工业生产有悠久的历史和广泛的群众基础。它同社会生产和人民生活的关系非常密切，在国民经济中占有相当重要的地位。它的行业很多，产品多种多样。从简单细小的发卡、鞋眼，到桌椅板凳、各式农具和工具、建筑器材，以至衣帽鞋袜和不少在国内外享有很高声誉的传统名牌产品等等，数以万计。至于精致、瑰丽、具有民族风格和地方色彩的工艺美术品，更是祖国文化的宝贵遗产。手工业的生产经营也很灵活，既有固定工场成批生产，也有零活加工、翻新补旧，还有游街串乡、流动服务，能够充分适应分散的、复杂的、变化多端、季节不同、要求各异的社会需要。
    由于个体手工业是以小私有制为基础的小商品经济，生产关系束缚着生产力的发展，并且有着资本主义的自发倾向。因此，必须进行社会主义改造，才能彻底解放生产力，充分发挥它对国民经济的积极作用；才能引导广大手工业劳动者逐步摆脱贫困，走上幸福富裕的康庄大道。
    当1949年全国解放前夕，党的七届二中全会就明确指出了个体手工业必须逐步向现代化和集体化的方向发展。全国解放后，党和政府一方面积极扶持手工业生产，一方面进行典型试办，有步骤地引导个体手工业向集体化的方向发展。到国民经济恢复时期的最后一年——1952年，全国手工业从业人员由1949年的五百八十五万五千人增加到七百三十六万四千人，产值由1949年的三十二亿三千万元上升到七十三亿二千万元，达到解放前最高年产值——1936年产值的96.6％。全国手工业合作社发展到二千六百七十八个，社员二十五万人，全年产值达二亿五千万元。
    1953年，我国进入国民经济建设的第一个五年计划时期，党提出了国家过渡时期的总路线，并把手工业社会主义改造作为总路线的组成部分之一。从此，我国手工业合作化运动进入了普遍发展阶段。为了引导广大手工业劳动者自觉地组织起来，党提出了“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，坚持了自愿互利原则和说服、示范、国家援助的方法，采用了适合群众觉悟程度和生产需要的三种组织形式——手工业供销生产小组、供销生产社和生产合作社，从供销入手，实行社会改造和生产改造，由小到大，由低到高，逐步地把手工业劳动者组织起来。到1954年底，全国手工业合作社（组）发展到四万一千多个，拥有社（组）员一百一十三万多人，全年产值十一亿六千万元。1955年上半年，各地手工业合作社先后开展了以加强社会主义教育、反对资本主义经营思想和作风为中心的整社运动，纯洁内部组织，端正经营方向，大力贯彻民主办社和勤俭办社的方针，因而从思想上、组织上进一步巩固了手工业合作组织。
    1955年下半年毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议公布以后，农业合作化首先进入高潮。1956年元月，在农业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造高潮的推动与影响下，手工业也出现了一个声势浩大的合作化运动高潮。在高潮中，大约有三百万人参加了手工业合作社，连同高潮以前组织起来的共达五百多万人。此外，农民兼营商品性手工业的从业人员和一部分分散在农村的个体手工业者参加了农业合作社，少数和工业、商业协作关系密切的个体手工业和资本主义工场手工业，参加了公私合营企业，和私营工商业一并进行改造。这样，手工业从个体私有制到集体所有制的改造任务已经基本完成。
    经过1956年声势浩大的全面合作化高潮和及时的整顿巩固以后，在手工业领域内摧毁了产生资本主义的经济基础，克服了生产关系和生产力之间的矛盾，为发掘手工业生产的巨大潜力，创造了极为重要的前提。几千年来，手工业劳动者受尽压迫、剥削的悲惨历史，从此一去不复返了。
    我国手工业在合作化以后，显示出为个体经济无可比拟的优越性：变个体经营为集体经营，一开始就可以摆脱商业资本和高利贷资本的控制和剥削，克服供销困难和淡季威胁，实现正常生产；进一步便于将手工业生产纳入国家计划，实行统筹兼顾，全面安排，统一规划，计划平衡；变个体劳动为集体劳动，便于在生产上实行分工协作，按照社员技艺高低和体力强弱，合理地组织劳动力，而且还可以发挥个人专长和集体智慧，不断地改进工具设备，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，扩大公共积累，以自力更生，自己武装自己的办法，逐步实现半机械化、机械化生产；组织起来后，生产关系发生了根本的变化，手工业中原有的封建关系和剥削关系，为新的社会主义的、民主的互助合作关系所代替，同时打破了传统的行会观念和保守思想，加强了团结，鼓舞了劳动热情。因此，生产有了迅速的发展。在实现合作化以后的1957年，全国手工业总产值达一百三十三亿元，比1949年增长三倍多，超额13.6％完成了第一个五年计划，比解放前最昌盛的年代——1936年增长78％。在生产发展的基础上，广大手工业劳动者的物质、文化生活不断得到改善和提高。第一个五年计划期间，手工业生产合作社社员的工资平均每年增长16.7％。手工业合作社还根据本身经济力量，举办了不同程度的各种劳保福利设施。如公费医疗、食堂、浴室、托儿所等等，改变了手工业劳动者在旧社会生老病死都无所依靠的现象。手工业合作社还为社员学习文化提供了极为有利的条件，举办了扫盲班、业余文化学校和技术训练班，组织了俱乐部、剧团、球队等各种文化娱乐体育组织，使许许多多的社员摘掉了文盲帽子，提高了科学技术水平，增强了体质，丰富了文化生活。经过合作化道路，我国广大手工业劳动者从此走上了文明生产和富裕生活的康庄大道。
    1958年，在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，手工业和整个工农业生产一样，出现了空前未有的大跃进。这一年，全国手工业总产值（包括渔业、盐业、农民兼营商品性的手工业）约计为二百亿元，比1957年增长近50％；其中手工业合作社连同已经转厂过渡的单位为一百四十多亿元，比1957年增长近70％。增长的速度远远超过解放后的任何一年。全部手工业生产增长的绝对值达七十亿元，超过第一个五年计划期间增长的总和。在技术革命方面，手工业合作组织在充分发动群众、自力更生、自己武装自己的方针下，在国家、上级社及有关部门的帮助和协作下，因陋就简地从改革现有工具设备和提高技艺入手，采取土洋结合、由土到洋的办法，自己动手制造各种机器设备，不少单位逐步实现了半机械化或机械化生产。到1958年底，全国手工业合作组织已拥有各种机械和动力设备达十二万台左右，半机械化、机械化的产值达到总产值的30％以上，初步改变了我国手工业生产的落后面貌。尤其是手工业合作社、厂全体社员、职工和干部都热烈地参加了全民大炼钢铁的伟大运动；在从小土炉发展到小高炉的过程中，取得了很大成绩。所有这些，都说明手工业在社会主义改造胜利的基础上，在贯彻执行总路线的过程中所表现出来的新生命力。
    随着生产的巨大发展，手工业合作社的生产关系也发生了新的改变。早在1956年下半年，党的八大第一次会议就已经指出：“一部分的合作组织在适当的条件下，将要发展成为国营企业或者并入国营企业；一部分的合作组织将在长时期内保持生产资料的集体所有制；而另一部分的合作组织，则将在社会主义企业的管理下保持各负盈亏的经营方式”。根据这一方针，从1956年冬季起，各地即在一部分规模较大、积累较多、机械化程度较高的老社中开展了转厂过渡的试点工作，1958年，在工农业生产大跃进，特别是在各地大办工业和农村人民公社化的推动下，手工业合作社的转厂过渡由个别试点进入到分期分批、全面推开的新阶段。据1959年5月的统计，全国十万多个手工业合作社的五百多万社员中，已经过渡为地方国营工厂的占37.8％，转为手工业联社经营的合作工厂的占13.6％，转为人民公社工厂的占35.3％，目前还保留合作社形式的占13.3％。手工业合作社转为地方国营工厂和合作工厂以后，原有的干部、资金、设备、劳动力和技术力量，都可以在更大的范围内统一调剂和合理使用，更便于国家按行业统筹安排生产，充分利用原有手工业合作社的基础发展地方工业。还有不少单位进行了经济改组和扩建改建，加速了手工业技术革命的进程。农村手工业合作社转为人民公社工厂以后，更有利于工农结合，为农业生产服务。
    1958年以来，手工业生产的飞跃发展和生产关系的深刻变革，成绩是巨大的。但是，有些地区在手工业合作社转厂过渡、经济改组的同时，对统筹安排注意不够，挤掉了一些小商品生产和修理服务业务。同时，由于社会购买力的迅速增长，一部分手工业小商品在市场上出现了供不应求的情况。对这些问题，从今年春季开始，中央和地方党委就着手采取措施。几个月来，手工业生产又有了很大的发展。少数停产减产的产品已经恢复生产，许多地区还根据人民需要增加了一些新的品种，当令商品源源上市。修理服务业务也扩大和增加了许多新的服务项目，受到广大人民群众热烈的欢迎。
    十年的改造经验证明，手工业不仅在过去，而且在今后，都是国民经济的一个重要部门。有的人认为“国家工业化，手工业可有可无”，这种思想是片面的，不正确的。现代化大工业是国民经济的基础，必须多快好省地发展它。但是在迅速发展现代化大工业的同时，还要发展手工业小产品的生产；因为大工业不能完全代替手工业。因此，在发展现代化大工业的同时，必须加强对手工业生产的领导。只有这样才能正确贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线所规定的大中小并举、土法生产和洋法生产并举的两条腿走路的方针。
    现在，在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜下，一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动高潮，正在全国手工业合作厂、社开展着。广大社员职工以战斗的姿态，奋勇前进；决心贡献出自己全部的力量和智慧，为加速祖国工业化，为争取早日建成社会主义而斗争。
