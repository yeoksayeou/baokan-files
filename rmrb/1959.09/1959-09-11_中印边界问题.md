    The Sino-Indian border is approximately two thousand kilometers long, and none of it has been formally demarcated. The Sino-Indian border issue is a complex problem left over by history and is a product of British imperialist aggression. During the period of British rule in India, Britain harbored aggressive ambitions towards China's Tibet region, trying to create a state of "independence" or semi-"independence" for Tibet in order to place it under British control. At the same time, Britain also used India as a base to extensively expand its territory into China's Tibet and even Xinjiang regions. Britain also constantly tampered with maps, resulting in increasing discrepancies between Chinese and British/Indian maps regarding the delineation of the Sino-Indian border.
    After India's independence, the Indian government insisted on inheriting the boundary line unilaterally declared by Britain, insisted on the unilateral modifications made to the traditional depiction of the Sino-Indian border on Indian-published maps, and forcibly demanded that China accept them. This unreasonable attitude of the Indian government has not only prevented the Sino-Indian border issue from being resolved but has also led to many new disputes and damaged Sino-Indian friendly relations.
    The following is a description of the historical background and existing problems of the Sino-Indian border, divided into three sections from west to east:
    (1) Regarding the section of the border between China's Xinjiang and Tibet regions and India's Ladakh. This section of the border has never been formally demarcated in history. The consistent depiction of this section of the border on Chinese-published maps is based on the actually existing traditional customary line, which conforms to the scope of China's historical administrative jurisdiction. The current Indian-published maps depict this section of the border as extending approximately 38,000 square kilometers into Chinese territory, and India insists on considering these areas as Indian territory. However, neither in the past nor now has the administrative jurisdiction of Britain or India ever reached these areas. The Indian government insists that the depiction of this section of the border on Indian maps is based on an 1842 treaty between Tibet and Kashmir, and that the Chinese government confirmed this boundary line in 1847. However, this is a completely far-fetched claim. In 1842, after an armed conflict between the Chinese Tibet local authorities and the Kashmir authorities, they signed a treaty of peace, but the treaty only vaguely mentioned that both sides would abide by their respective boundaries, without specifically stipulating or explaining the location of this boundary. In 1847, when Qi Ying, the Governor-General of Liangguang, replied to the British representative in Guangdong's request to demarcate this section of the boundary, he only stated that there was a traditional boundary to follow and that there was no need for surveying. The reply did not mention any border treaty, nor did it agree to any British border claims. It is clear that the claim that this section of the border was determined by treaty is groundless. Recently, Prime Minister Nehru also had to admit: "This is the border between the old Kashmir state and Tibet and Chinese Turkestan. No one has ever demarcated this border."
    It must also be pointed out that the depiction of this section of the border on Indian maps is also extremely inconsistent with many early British-published maps (for example, the map of "Punjab, Western Himalayas, and parts bordering Tibet" drawn by the Englishman John Walker in 1854 under the order of the East India Company). These maps marked the boundary closer to Chinese maps, not closer to current Indian maps. Therefore, India is only inheriting the boundary line fabricated by Britain in its later period for territorial expansion. The British border claims have no legal basis and do not conform to the historical reality of the border.
    In order to invade and occupy the Chinese territory unilaterally incorporated into its territory by India, the Indian government has repeatedly sent armed personnel to illegally intrude into our country for reconnaissance and surveying activities in recent years. In September 1958 and July 1959, two groups of Indian troops, the first group of fifteen people and the second group of six people, were captured by our border defense forces in the Dahongliutan area of southern Xinjiang and the Bangong Lake area of Tibet, respectively, and were sent out of the country. Afterwards, the Indian side falsely accused us of illegally occupying Indian territory and said that our Xinjiang-Tibet highway was built in Indian territory, lodging a protest with us. We immediately sternly refuted this and warned the Indian army not to intrude again.
    (2) Regarding the section of the border between China's Ali region of Tibet and India's Punjab and Uttar Pradesh provinces. This section of the border has also not been formally demarcated by the two countries, a fact that the Indian government acknowledges, but there is a customary line to follow. Our country's maps have always depicted this boundary line according to the customary line, while the depiction of this boundary line on currently published Indian maps differs to varying degrees from our country's maps in many places. There have always been disputes between the two sides over the ownership of many places. For example, the Sang and Congsha areas southwest of Zhabranzong in Tibet, which have historically belonged to China, were invaded and occupied by the British-Indian side thirty or forty years ago. The Tibetan local authorities repeatedly negotiated with the British side without result, becoming a historical unresolved case. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Indian troops successively invaded and occupied Barigas, Juwa, Qure, Shipchi Pass, Boling Sando, Xiangzha, Labudi and other places within our country, and have not withdrawn to this day. Another place, Wure, is also our country's territory and has always been under our administrative jurisdiction. After 1954, Indian troops invaded twice and formed a sharp confrontation with our army. In order to avoid conflict, the two sides reached a temporary agreement of mutual non-stationing of troops to facilitate resolution through negotiations. However, due to obstruction by the Indian side, negotiations have not yet yielded results. In 1958 and 1959, the Indian side still invaded with "civilian personnel." In order to maintain Sino-Indian friendship, we have taken a restrained attitude towards the above-mentioned incidents of the Indian side's occupation of our territory in the past and have never disclosed them to the outside world.
    (3) Regarding the Sino-Indian border east of Bhutan. This section of the border has also not been formally demarcated, but there is a traditional boundary to follow. The boundary line drawn on our country's maps is bounded by the southern foot of the Himalayas. The area north of the southern foot has always been under the administrative jurisdiction of the Tibetan local government. This depiction fully conforms to the traditional boundary line between the two countries. Thirty years ago, British and Indian-published maps generally adopted this depiction. Later, British and Indian-published maps used the Himalayan mountain ridge as the boundary, actually including approximately 90,000 square kilometers of Chinese territory, equivalent to a Zhejiang province, within the Indian map.
    The Indian government insists that the boundary line it advocates has been formally and clearly demarcated through treaties long ago. The basis it puts forward is that the boundary line was jointly demarcated at the Simla Conference held in Simla, India, in 1913-1914 by representatives of the Chinese government, the Tibetan local authorities, and the British government, namely the so-called McMahon Line (McMahon was the name of the British representative). This statement by India is completely inconsistent with the facts. In fact, the Simla Conference was a conference planned by Britain to coerce China into recognizing the semi-independent status of Tibet, incorporating many places in mainland China into Tibet, and strengthening Britain's special position in Tibet. Given that the conference was not proceeding smoothly, Britain did not dare to raise its other conspiracy, namely the demarcation of the Indo-Tibetan border, for discussion at the conference, and the other two parties did not mention the Indo-Tibetan border issue at all. The so-called McMahon Line was determined in Delhi in March 1914, more than three months before the signing of the Simla Treaty, by representatives of the British government and representatives of the Tibetan local authorities, concealing it from the representatives of the Chinese central government, through a secret exchange of notes. This exchange of notes was clearly illegal and invalid. The text of the Simla Treaty also did not mention the Indo-Tibetan border issue at all. Only in the attached map of the treaty, the McMahon Line was secretly marked as part of the boundary between Tibet and other parts of China. According to this marking, this line cannot be interpreted as the national border between China's Tibet and India under any circumstances. Moreover, the representative of the Chinese government did not sign this Simla Treaty, and none of the central governments of China at that time and later have ever recognized it. Therefore, this treaty is also illegal and invalid. Precisely because of the above reasons, Britain dared not publish the full text of the above-mentioned secret exchange of notes and the Simla Treaty for more than ten years, and British-Indian maps did not dare to adopt the depiction of the "McMahon Line." For example, the map of "Tibet and its Neighboring Countries" published by the Indian Survey Bureau in 1917 and the attached map in Volume 24 of the 14th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1929 still depicted this section of the border in the same way as Chinese-published maps. The areas south of the "McMahon Line," which have historically belonged to our country, were basically still controlled by our country's Tibetan local government until after 1940, when British troops invaded and occupied some places in this area. The Chinese people naturally felt great indignation at the McMahon Line, and the Tibetan local government later publicly expressed strong dissatisfaction with it. Before and after India's independence in 1947, the Tibetan local authorities successively negotiated with the British-Indian side and telegraphed Prime Minister Nehru, requesting the return of all areas south of the "McMahon Line" that had historically belonged to China's Tibet. At that time, the Indian government proposed in its reply to "maintain the relations between the two sides on the existing basis until a new agreement acceptable to both sides is reached." This shows that the Indian government did not rule out the possibility of reaching a new agreement at that time.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially before and after the peaceful liberation of China's Tibet in 1951, Indian troops advanced on a large scale into the area south of the so-called McMahon Line. The Chinese government later explained to the Indian government that China does not recognize the McMahon Line. However, for the sake of Sino-Indian friendship and maintaining harmony on the border, the Chinese army will also not cross this line in order to facilitate the rational solution of the border issue through negotiations in the future. Due to China's friendly attitude, the border area has been basically peaceful for several years. However, since the Tibetan rebellion this year, a large number of Tibetan rebels have crossed this line and fled into India, and the Indian army has continued to press northward. The Indian army has not only exceeded the so-called McMahon Line marked on the attached map of the above-mentioned secret exchange of notes but also exceeded the boundary line marked on the currently published Indian maps (this line is said to be the so-called McMahon Line, but in fact, it is deeper into Chinese territory than the so-called McMahon Line in many places). The Indian army has invaded and occupied Langjiu north of these two lines, invaded Yaxier, and is still occupying Shaze, Jianzemani, and Tamadun. The Indian army also provoked our guard troops stationed north of the so-called McMahon Line to prevent the remaining Tibetan armed rebels from entering and leaving the border to carry out harassment.
    On August 25, 1959, the Indian troops invading Langjiu opened fire on our troops stationed in Majidun for no reason, provoking the first armed conflict incident on the entire Sino-Indian border. On August 26, the Indian troops there fired on our army again. We ignored it. The Indian troops were guilty and began to retreat south of the "McMahon Line."
    Recently, the Indian government, in coordination with the military advance on the border, has continuously exerted pressure on our country on the border issue in diplomatic and public opinion aspects, attempting to force our country to accept the illegal boundary line concerning the Sino-Indian border that the Indian government inherited from British imperialism. The Indian government, Congress, and so-called public opinion, as well as some political figures, have used the border issue to clamor, slander our country for invading India, and accuse our country of being imperialistic, and have stirred up a new anti-China climax in India. Imperialism is also taking the opportunity to fan the flames and do its best to provoke Sino-Indian relations. In order to distinguish right from wrong and responsibility, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of our government, sent a letter to Prime Minister Nehru on September 8, 1959, systematically explaining the true situation of the Sino-Indian border and our country's consistent position and proposition adopted for maintaining Sino-Indian friendship and fairly and reasonably resolving the Sino-Indian border issue.

    中印边界问题
    新华社
    中印边界共长约二千公里，全部未经划定。中印边界问题是历史遗留下来的复杂问题，是英帝国主义侵略政策的产物。在英国统治印度时期，英国对中国西藏地方抱有侵略野心，极力制造西藏的“独立”或者半“独立”状态，以便把西藏置于英国的控制之下。与此同时，英国还以印度为基地，广泛地向中国的西藏地方甚至新疆地方进行领土扩张。英国并不断篡改地图，致使中国和英、印出版的地图对中印疆界画法的出入越来越大。
    印度独立后，印度政府坚持继承英国片面宣布的疆界线，坚持印度出版的地图对于中印边界传统的画法所作的片面修改，并且强要中国加以接受。印度政府这种不合理态度使中印边界问题非但不能得到解决，反而导致许多新的纠纷，并使中印友好关系受到损害。
    现将中印边界自西向东分为三段说明边界的历史背景和现存问题如下：
    （一）关于中国的新疆地方和西藏地方同印度的拉达克一段边界。这段边界历史上从未正式划定。中国出版的地图对这段边界的一贯画法是根据实际存在的传统习惯线，这符合于中国历来行政管辖所到达的范围。印度现行出版的地图对这段边界的画法却深入中国境内约三万八千平方公里，印度把这些地方硬算作印度领土。但是，无论过去和现在，英国和印度的行政管辖都从来没有到达过这些地方。印度政府坚持，印度地图对这段边界的画法是根据1842年西藏和克什米尔的一项条约，而且1847年中国政府确认过这段边界线。但是，这完全是牵强附会的说法。1842年，中国西藏地方当局同克什米尔当局在双方发生了一场武装冲突之后，签订过一项和约，但是，和约中只泛泛提到双方将恪守各自的疆界，而并没有具体规定和说明这段边界的位置。1847年两广总督耆英在答复英国驻广东代表要求划定这一段界址的时候，也只表示既有传统的边界可循，无用勘定。答复中既未提到什么边界条约，也未同意英方的任何边界主张。由此可见，所谓这段边界曾由条约确定的说法是毫无根据的。最近，尼赫鲁总理也不得不承认：“这是旧克什米尔邦同西藏和中国土耳其斯坦的疆界。没有谁划定过这条疆界。”
    还须指出，印度地图对这段边界的画法也同早期英国出版的许多地图（例如，1854年英国人约翰·瓦克根据东印度公司董事会的命令所画的“旁遮普、喜马拉雅山西部以及同西藏接壤部分”图）极不一致。这些地图对边界的标法是更接近于中国地图，不是更接近于现行的印度地图。因此，印度只是继承英国后期为进行领土扩张而凭空臆造出来的边界线，英国的边界主张既无法理根据又不符合边界的历来实际情况。
    印度政府为了侵占印度片面划入自己版图的中国领土，近年来竟多次派遣武装人员非法窜入我国境内进行侦察和勘查活动。1958年9月和1959年7月，印军两批，第一批十五人，第二批六人，分别在南疆大红柳滩和西藏班公湖地区为我边防部队捕获，并且被遣送出境。事后印方反诬我非法侵占印度领土，并且说我新疆—西藏公路修筑在印度境内，向我提出抗议。我当即严加驳斥，并且警告印军不得再行侵入。
    （二）关于中国西藏阿里地区同印度旁遮普省、北方省接壤的一段边界。这一段边界也是未经两国正式划定的，印度政府承认这一事实，但是有习惯线可循。我国地图对这段边界线一向是按习惯线画的，而印度目前出版的地图对这段界线的画法同我国地图画法在许多地点有不同程度的出入。双方对许多地点的归属问题历来就有争执。例如，在西藏扎布兰宗西南、历来属于中国的桑、葱莎地区，三四十年以前就为英印方面侵占，西藏地方当局几度同英方交涉均无结果，成为历史悬案。和平解放西藏后，印军又先后侵占我国境内的巴里加斯、巨哇、曲惹、什普奇山口、波林三多、香扎、拉不底等地，至今未退。另乌热一地，也是我国领土，历来受我行政管辖，1954年后，印军两次侵入并同我军形成尖锐对峙。为避免冲突，双方曾达成互不驻军的临时协议，以便通过谈判解决。但由于印方的阻挠，谈判迄无结果。而印方于1958、1959两年仍以“民政人员”侵入。为了维护中印友谊，对印方上述侵占我领土的事件，我过去尽量采取克制态度，从未向外披露。
    （三）关于不丹以东的中印边界。这段边界也是未经正式划定，但是有传统疆界可循的。我国地图所画的这段边界线是沿喜马拉雅山南麓为界，南麓以北地区，过去一直由西藏地方政府行使行政管辖权，这样画法是完全符合两国的传统边界线的。三十年以前，英、印出版的地图一般也采取这种画法。后来英国和印度出版的地图却以喜马拉雅山山脊为界，竟把大约九万平方公里，即相当于一个浙江省的中国领土，画入印度版图之内。
    印度政府坚持，它所主张的边界线是早经通过条约、正式、明确划定了的。它所提出的根据是，1913—1914年在印度西姆拉由中国政府、西藏地方当局和英国政府三方面代表所举行的会议上共同划定了这段边界线，即所谓麦克马洪线（按麦克马洪是英国代表的名字）。印度的这种说法是完全不符合事实的。事实上，西姆拉会议是英国为胁迫中国承认西藏的半独立状态、把中国内地的许多地方划入西藏和加强英国在西藏的特殊地位而策划的一次会议，英国鉴于会议进行得并不顺利，没有敢把它的另一阴谋即划定印藏边界问题提到会议上讨论，其他两方也根本没有提过印藏边界问题。所谓麦克马洪线，是在西姆拉会议以外由英国政府代表同西藏地方当局的代表，瞒着中国中央政府的代表，于1914年3月，也就是在西姆拉条约签订前三个多月，在德里用秘密换文的方式所确定的。这个换文显然是非法的，无效的。西姆拉条约的约文也根本没有提到印藏边界问题。只是在条约的附图中，把这条麦克马洪线偷偷地作为西藏同中国其他部分之间的界线的一部分标在图上，根据这种标法，这条线也无论如何不能被解释为中国西藏地方同印度之间的国界线。而且就是这个西姆拉条约，中国政府的代表也没有签字，中国当时的以及以后的任何一个中央政府都始终拒绝承认，因此这个条约也是非法的，无效的。正由于上述种种原因，英国隔了十多年还迟迟不敢公布上述秘密换文和西姆拉条约的全文，英印地图也不敢采用“麦克马洪线”的画法。例如1917年印度测量局出版的“西藏及其邻国”图和1929年第十四版大英百科全书第二十四卷附图，对这段边界的画法，都仍然同中国出版的地图一致。“麦克马洪线”以南历来属于我国的地区基本上也还是由我国西藏地方政府控制着，直到1940年以后，英国军队才侵占这一地区的若干地点。中国人民自然对麦克马洪线感到极大愤慨，就是西藏地方政府后来也对此公开表示强烈不满。1947年印度独立前后，西藏地方当局先后同英印方交涉并曾致电尼赫鲁总理，要求归还“麦克马洪线”以南的历来属于中国西藏地方的全部地区。当时印度政府在答复中提出“在现存基础上维持双方关系，直到双方均愿接受的新协定达成为止。”这说明印度政府当时并没有排除达成新的协议的可能。
    中华人民共和国成立后，特别是1951年中国西藏地方和平解放前后，印度军队大规模地向所谓麦克马洪线以南地区推进。中国政府以后向印度政府说明，中国并不承认麦克马洪线。但是，为了中印友谊和维持边境的和睦，中国军队也不越过这条线，以利于以后通过谈判谋求边界问题的合理解决。由于中国的这种友好态度，若干年来这一带边境基本相安无事。但是，自从今年西藏叛乱发生以后，大批西藏叛乱分子越过这条线逃入印度，印度军队就继续向北进逼。印军不仅超越了上述秘密换文附图中标明的所谓麦克马洪线，而且超越了印度现行出版的地图上标明的边界线（这条线据说就是所谓麦克马洪线。但是实际上在许多地方比所谓麦克马洪线更加深入中国境内）。印军在这两条线以北侵占了朗久，侵入了雅斜儿，并且仍然侵占着沙则、兼则马尼、塔马顿。印军还对我国为防止残余的西藏武装叛匪出入边境进行骚扰而派驻到所谓麦克马洪线以北的警戒部队进行挑衅。
    1959年8月25日，侵入朗久的印军对我驻马及墩的部队无端开火，挑起了整个中印边界上的第一次武装冲突事件。8月26日该处印军再次向我军进行射击，我未置理，印军心虚，始退往“麦克马洪线”以南。
    最近印度政府配合边境上的军事进逼，在外交和舆论方面就边界问题不断对我国施加压力，企图迫使我国接受印度政府从英帝国主义承袭下来的关于中印边界的非法界线。印度政府、国会和所谓公众舆论以及一部分政界人士利用边界问题大肆叫嚷，诽谤我国侵略了印度，诬蔑我国是帝国主义，并且在印度挑起一个新的反华高潮。帝国主义也正借机煽风点火，竭力挑拨中印关系。为了明辨是非和责任，周恩来总理代表我国政府已于1959年9月8日致函尼赫鲁总理，系统地说明中印边界的真实情况和我国为维护中印友好和公平合理地解决中印边界问题所采取的一贯立场和主张。　（新华社10日讯）（附图片）
