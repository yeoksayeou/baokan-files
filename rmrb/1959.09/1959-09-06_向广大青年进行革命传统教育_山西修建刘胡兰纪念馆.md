　　To Conduct Revolutionary Tradition Education for the Broad Masses of Youth
　　Shanxi Builds Liu Hulan Memorial Hall

　　(Our dispatch) Yunzhou West Village (formerly belonging to Wenshui County), the hometown of the revolutionary heroine Martyr Liu Hulan, has recently started the construction of a large-scale Liu Hulan Memorial Hall.

　　The Liu Hulan Memorial Hall is being expanded on the basis of the original Martyrs' Cemetery. According to the design, the memorial hall gate faces south, and inside the gate is a white marble inscription tower, which will be engraved with Chairman Mao Zedong's inscription for Martyr Liu Hulan: "A great life, a glorious death." The back of the tower is engraved with the decision of the CPC Central Jin Sui Branch to posthumously recognize Liu Hulan as a full member of the Communist Party of China. Passing the inscription tower, there is a Chinese national-style memorial hall. The memorial hall is located in the center of the north end of the original east and west rows of exhibition rooms and is the center of the entire building. To the east of the hall is the ancient temple where the enemy interrogated Liu Hulan and the place where the martyr died. The white marble statue of the hero meticulously sculpted by Chinese sculptor Wang Chaowen will stand in front of the martyr's tomb, surrounded by flower beds and green trees. At the same time, the historical appearance will be restored and landmarks built at "Hulan's Home" and the places where Martyr Liu Hulan lived.

　　The memorial hall will display physical objects and documents of Martyr Liu Hulan's life and artistic works, as well as physical objects and photos of activities commemorating and learning from Martyr Liu Hulan. The memorial hall will also display materials and artistic works reflecting the major events and heroic figures of the revolutionary struggle of the people of Shanxi under the leadership of the Party since the "September 18th" Incident. Autographed inscriptions from responsible comrades of the central and provincial governments, as well as Guo Moruo's "Ode to Liu Hulan."

　　The construction of the memorial hall officially started on July 2. It is currently being rushed day and night and will be completed soon. The construction of this memorial hall is led by the Preparatory Committee composed of Zheng Lin, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor of Shanxi Province, and others. The memorial hall is expected to be partially opened for the tenth anniversary of the National Day and fully opened on "July 1" next year.

　　The preparation of the Liu Hulan Memorial Hall is of great significance. It will become a school for conducting revolutionary tradition education for the people and youth of the whole country.

　　Comrade Liu Hulan was born on October 8, 1932, into an ordinary peasant family. On January 12, 1947, she heroically dedicated her young life to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. For more than ten years, her heroic name and her unyielding revolutionary spirit have become a shining example for the youth of the whole country to learn from. (Attached picture)

    向广大青年进行革命传统教育
    山西修建刘胡兰纪念馆
    本报讯  革命女英雄刘胡兰烈士的家乡——山西省汾阳县云周西村（原属文水县），最近动工修建一座规模较大的刘胡兰纪念馆。
    刘胡兰纪念馆是在原来烈士陵园的基础上扩建的。按照设计，纪念馆大门坐北向南，一进大门是一座汉白玉的题字塔，上面将镌刻毛泽东主席为刘胡兰烈士的题字：“生的伟大，死的光荣”。塔的背面刻有中共中央晋绥分局关于追认刘胡兰为中国共产党正式党员的决定。绕过题字塔，是一座中国民族形式的纪念大厅，纪念大厅位于原来东西两排陈列室北端的中央，是整个建筑的中心，大厅东面是敌人审讯刘胡兰的古庙和烈士就义处。中国雕塑家王朝闻精心塑造的表彰英雄形象的汉白玉雕像将要在烈士墓前耸立起来，烈士像的周围满布花坛和绿树。同时在“胡兰之家”以及刘胡兰烈士生前活动的地方，都要恢复历史原貌和建树标志。
    纪念馆将陈列关于刘胡兰烈士生平事迹的实物及文献和艺术作品，关于纪念和学习刘胡兰烈士活动的实物、照片等。纪念馆还将陈列表现“九一八”以来，党领导下的山西人民革命斗争的重大事件和英雄人物的资料和艺术作品。中央和省的负责同志的亲笔题字。还有郭沫若同志写的“刘胡兰赞”。
    纪念馆的修建工程于7月2日正式动工，目前正在日夜赶修，将在最近完工。由中共山西省委书记处书记、山西省副省长郑林等人组成的筹备委员会领导这个纪念馆的建设工作。纪念馆预计国庆十周年部分开放，明年“七一”全部开放。
    刘胡兰纪念馆的筹建有着重大意义，它将成为一所向全国人民和青年进行革命传统教育的学校。
    刘胡兰同志于1932年10月8日出生在一个普通农民的家庭里，1947年1月12日，她为中国人民的解放事业壮烈地献出了年轻的生命。十多年来她的英名，她那种坚贞不屈的革命精神，已成为全国青年学习的光辉榜样。（附图片）
