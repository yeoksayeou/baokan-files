I stand on the Kunlun Mountains, watching the rolling Yellow River and Yangtze River, they flow through the land of heroes, singing to the great motherland. Motherland, oh motherland, you stand tall in the East; Motherland, oh motherland, you are engraved in our hearts. You nourish our youthful vitality; We call out to you day and night, our most loving mother!
I walk into the newly built factory, inside are lathes connected to lathes; Listen to the songs of the working class, praising our beloved motherland. Motherland, oh motherland, you have the boldness of a flying dragon; Motherland, oh motherland, you have the strength of a mighty lion. We shed our blood for you on the battlefield, Now let you transform into the most beautiful phoenix in the world!
See the colorful clouds hanging in the sky, fragrant flowers blooming in front of the door, The fields are filled with happy people, striving to pile gold into mountain ridges. Motherland, oh motherland, you have stood up with the chest of a giant; Motherland, oh motherland, you are leaping forward on the road of progress. We are exerting our soaring strength for you, you will radiate the most brilliant light for generations to come!
Listen to the incomparably loud singing, it spreads its wings in the commune, like a large orchestra, traveling all over the vast country and borders. Motherland, oh motherland, the people's commune has endless treasures, Motherland, oh motherland, it is a bridge for your greater prosperity. We are not afraid of the enemy's curses and slanders; You have a sun, forever shining in the East!

    祖国颂（歌词）
    放平我站立在昆仑山上，望着滚滚的黄河长江，它们流过英雄的土地，在向伟大的祖国歌唱。祖国呵祖国，你屹立在世界的东方；祖国呵祖国，你铭刻在我们的心上。你为我们滋润着青春的活力；我们日日夜夜呼唤你最慈爱的亲娘！我走进新盖的工厂，里面是车床连着车床；听听工人阶级的歌声，在把亲爱的祖国赞扬。祖国呵祖国，你有飞龙一样的豪放；祖国呵祖国，你有雄狮一样的刚强。我们为你把鲜血洒遍了战场，如今让你化成世界上最美丽的凤凰！看彩云挂在天上，鲜花在门前开得喷香，田野上是幸福的人群，努力把黄金堆成山岗。祖国呵祖国，你挺起了巨人的胸膛；祖国呵祖国，你飞跃在前进的路上。我们为你正使出冲天的力量，你将世世代代放射着最灿烂的光芒！听歌声无比地嘹亮，它在公社里张开翅膀，好像一支大型的乐队，走遍辽阔的国土和边疆。祖国呵祖国，人民公社有无穷的蕴藏，祖国呵祖国，它是你更繁荣的桥梁。我们不怕敌人的诅咒和诽谤；你有一颗太阳，永远永远地照在东方！
