    Hurrah for Three Cheers
    Guo Moruo
    I. Long Live the General Line!
    A glorious line strives to be first,
    Infinite brightness illuminates the universe.
    We shout "Long Live" three times, hats off,
    Double the leap forward, whip on.
    The yapping dogs bark at the days of Yao,
    The fluttering phoenixes sing the praises of Shun's heaven.
    Brilliant hundred flowers bloom together,
    Ten years of construction surpass a thousand.

    II. Long Live the Great Leap Forward!
    The people's liberation is unprecedented,
    A burst of east wind heralds victory.
    Drawing water up the mountain, water down the mountain,
    Turning the sky and patting the earth, the earth kisses the sky.
    Thousands of communes churn the waves of grain,
    Large and small blast furnaces gush forth iron springs.
    Melt away the snow on the peaks of Kunlun,
    We will transform the Gobi into fertile fields.

    III. Long Live the People's Communes!
    How can we forget the large scale and public ownership?
    Creating the universe, controlling heaven and earth.
    Distribution according to labor, three-level ownership,
    Happy in work, singing praises in ten thousand chapters.
    With discipline and order, labor is easily transformed,
    The power to resist floods and droughts is immeasurable.
    The highest merit belongs to the Party,
    The glory of the rising sun shines in all directions.

    三呼万岁
    郭沫若
    一、总路线万岁！辉煌路线力争先，无限光明照大千。万岁高呼三脱帽，两番跃进再加鞭。啀啀桀犬吠尧日，翽翽鸾凰颂舜天。灿烂百花齐放蕊，十年建设胜千年。
    二、大跃进万岁！人民解放力空前，一片东风奏凯旋。引水上山山下水，掀天抚地地摩天。万千公社翻禾浪，大小高炉涌铁泉。化尽昆仑巅上雪，要将戈壁化良田。
    三、人民公社万岁！一大二公岂可忘？创新宇宙控玄黄。按劳分配权三级，乐业欢虞颂万章。有纪有纲工易化，抗涝抗旱力难量，最高功绩归于党，旭日光华照八方。
