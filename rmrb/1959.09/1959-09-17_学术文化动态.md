Soviet Scholar Karayev Writes "Military Science of Ancient China"

Recently, the famous Soviet military historian, retired Major General Karayev, completed the book "Military Science of Ancient China." In this work, the author narrates the emergence and development of ancient China's unique and advanced military science, and explores the works of Sun Tzu and other famous ancient strategists and military theorists.

After analyzing many facts, Karayev pointed out that it is a deliberate distortion for bourgeois historians to insist that the ancient military heritage of countries such as Egypt, China, and India is merely "prehistory of true military science." Karayev wrote that in the distant past, when the dawn of human history had just appeared, the Chinese people were already representatives of high culture and advanced military science in East Asia. In particular, Sun Tzu, who lived at the end of the fifth and the beginning of the sixth century BC, wrote the first book in history that discussed the essence of the phenomenon of war and expounded the principles of military science. Many of the arguments he put forward are still valid today.

British Scientists Discover "Permeability Factor"

According to foreign news reports, some British scientists have been conducting research at the Lister Institute in London since 1955. They have isolated a substance, previously unknown, from the serum of guinea pigs. This substance can increase the permeability of small blood vessels and is called PF (permeability factor). It exists in serum in an inactive form, and it becomes active when the serum is diluted 1/200 with water. The director of the institute believes that this is an alpha-2-globulin, possibly an enzyme (perhaps a protease). They are continuing their research to prove that not only guinea pig serum has this substance, but also the serum of rats, rabbits, cats, dogs, horses, cattle, and even humans. This research is also being carried out in other laboratories, and some people have found globulins similar to PF in inflammatory exudates. After studying their effects on permeability, they believe that their effect is better than the inflammatory edema or other histamines discovered in the United States in 1930.

    学术文化动态
    苏联卡拉耶夫撰写“古代中国的军事学”
    最近，苏联著名的军事历史学家，退休的少将卡拉耶夫写成了“古代中国的军事学”一书。作者在这部著作中，叙述了古代中国独特的和先进的军事学的产生和发展，并且探讨了孙子和其他一些古代著名的战略家和军事理论家的著作。
    卡拉耶夫在分析了许多事实以后指出，资产阶级历史学家硬说，埃及、中国和印度等国家的古老的军事遗产只不过是“真正军事学的史前期的东西”，这是一种别有用心的说法。卡拉耶夫写道，在遥远的古代，当人类历史刚刚现出曙光的时候，中国人民就已经是亚洲东部高度文化和先进军事学的代表者。特别是公元前五世纪末、六世纪初的孙子，写出了历史上第一部论述战争现象实质的著作，阐述了军事学的原理。他所提出的许多论点，直到现在仍然有效。
    英国科学家发现“渗透因素”
    据国外消息报道，英国的一些科学家从1955年开始，在伦敦李斯特研究所进行着一项研究工作，他们从豚鼠的血清中分离出一种至今还没有人知道的物质，这种物质能够增加小血管的渗透性，这种物质叫做PF（渗透因素permeabilityfactor）。它以一种不活跃的形式存在于血清中，如用水将血清稀释1／200，它就会活动起来。这个研究所的所长认为，这是一种甲二球蛋白，也可能是一种酶（也许是蛋白酶）。他们正在继续研究，以便证明不仅仅豚鼠血清中具有这种物质，在鼠、家兔、猫、狗、马、牛，以至人的血清中都有这种物质。这个研究在别的实验室也在进行，并有人从发炎渗出物中找到了类似PF的球蛋白，研究了它们对于渗透性的影响后，认为它们的作用胜过1930年美国发现的发炎性水肿或其他的组胺。
