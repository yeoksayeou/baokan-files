The Patriotic Commune Vigorously Develops Basic Farmland Construction
Channels Run Horizontally and Vertically, Forming an Irrigation Network, Turning Tens of Thousands of Mu of Barren Land into Good Harvests

(Our Correspondent in Hefei, September 1st) Since its establishment, the Patriotic Commune in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, has achieved great success in developing basic farmland construction, fully demonstrating the superiority of the People's Commune.

The Patriotic Commune was formed in September last year by merging four agricultural cooperatives. The commune has more than 14,000 households, over 60,000 people, and more than 180,000 mu of land. Except for the western plains, where water conservancy conditions are relatively good, the water conservancy conditions in the upland and hilly areas are poor, and 40% of the cultivated land is prone to drought. The northwestern part is a low-lying area, and 21% of the total area is often subject to flooding. Before the establishment of the commune, although many water conservancy projects were built and played a certain role in drought and flood prevention, the limited manpower and resources of the small cooperatives restricted the construction of larger-scale water conservancy projects. For example, the Hongqiao River, which flows through the territory of the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative, was uncontrollable. In the vicinity of Yangxianpu alone, more than 15,000 mu of land were frequently flooded. However, during the water use season, more than 40,000 mu of land were often affected by drought due to the loss and drying up of river water. The Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative had wanted to build a control gate in the Hongqiao River channel near Yangxianpu several times, but because the project was large, it would take more than three months for all 2,000 able-bodied laborers in the cooperative to complete it. The cost of materials for building the gate would be 130,000 yuan, equivalent to the total production cost of the cooperative in 1957. Therefore, it had never been built. In the plains with better water conservancy conditions, in addition to the 80,000 mu of land along the banks of the Pihe River, the Xihe River, and the Hongqiao River that could be irrigated, more than 40,000 mu of land were also frequently affected by drought because the small cooperatives were unable to build large-scale water diversion channels, and the water storage capacity of ditches and ponds was small.

After the establishment of the commune, it first broke the boundaries of the original agricultural cooperatives, carried out unified planning, and systematically built various large-scale water conservancy projects. Last winter and this spring, the entire commune organized more than 9,000 people and put them into the battle of water conservancy construction, digging two main canals in the southeast to northeast highlands, with a total length of 65 li and a total earthwork of 2.2 million cubic meters. The Yangxianpu control gate, which the original small cooperatives were unable to build, was immediately organized by the commune to gather resources and materials from the masses. After several months of construction, the task of building the gate has now been completed. In the plains, the focus was on digging water diversion ditches and renovating existing ponds and dams. The entire commune renovated 450 large ditches and ponds, dug more than 200 water diversion channels, and built 12 culverts. Twelve water diversion channels were also built between rivers and channels. Now, except for the Pihe River on the southern edge, the other major rivers and channels have been interconnected, crisscrossing each other, and have initially formed a new irrigation system. After several months of water conservancy construction, it has not only completely solved the problem of waterlogging on 40,000 mu of land, but also expanded the irrigation area by 80,000 mu, and the area of gravity irrigation has also increased from the original 50,000 mu to 80,000 mu. These projects have played a significant role in the current fight against drought. Commune members said, "The big river was dug by the commune, the big gate was built by the commune, and the good harvest was brought by the commune."

Large-scale soil improvement is also a major basic farmland construction project carried out after the establishment of the Patriotic Commune. The commune has 30,000 mu of barren land, including Cheng Bai soil, sandy soil, dead yellow soil, and black sticky soil. These lands are not only difficult to plow and harrow, but also intolerant of water and drought. Generally, the yield per mu is only about 100 jin. The masses call it "three baskets of seedlings, one basket of rice, and barren land where rabbits don't leave droppings." These barren lands are concentrated in the areas of Gaojia Lake, Liao Jiahu Lake, Northwest Lake, and the southeastern highlands. It takes a lot of work to improve the soil on these lands, and the original agricultural cooperatives could not carry out this work due to limitations in labor and livestock. For example, the Dongfeng Brigade (formerly an agricultural cooperative) had 3,800 mu of inferior land in pieces. If the soil on these lands were to be improved, it would take all the labor force of the entire brigade a month. The original Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative had 12,000 mu of inferior land, but the entire cooperative only had 740 head of cattle. If the livestock were used for soil improvement work, it would delay winter plowing and spring plowing. After the establishment of the commune, a method of large-scale cooperation was adopted, organizing more than 20,000 laborers and 3,000 head of cattle from the entire commune. Combining water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, the soil structure was changed by methods such as "blending" (mixing sandy soil and clay), "pressing" (pressing ditch and pond mud), "burning" (burning soil bags on the spot), and combining deep plowing and increasing the application of organic fertilizers. The crops on the improved soil are now growing better than in the past, and the commune members happily said, "The commune has great strength, and good crops are also growing on barren land."

The Patriotic Commune also organized more than 12,000 laborers and more than 1,000 head of cattle to reclaim more than 13,000 mu of wasteland, added two tractors and six large machines such as water pumps, and built a small power station, all of which were impossible to do before the establishment of the commune.

    小社难展翅　公社飞得高
    爱国公社大搞农田基本建设
    渠道纵横形成灌溉网，几万亩薄地长出了好庄稼
    本报合肥1日电　安徽省寿县爱国公社从建社以来，在大办农田基本建设方面，取得了很大的成就，充分显示了人民公社的优越性。
    爱国公社是去年9月由四个农业社合并办成的，全社共有一万四千多户，六万多人，土地有十八万多亩。除西部平原水利条件较好以外，岗地和丘陵地区水利条件差，有40％的耕地容易受旱；西北部是一片洼地，经常受涝的占总面积的21％。办公社前，虽然兴修了不少水利工程，在防旱、防涝上发挥了一定作用，但是，由于社小，人力物力都受到一定限制，有些工程规模较大的水利建设，就无法兴建。例如流经爱国农业社境内的洪桥河，由于河水无法控制，仅杨仙铺附近，就有一万五千多亩土地经常受涝；但一到用水季节，则因河水流失、干涸，经常有四万多亩地受旱。爱国农业社几次想在杨仙铺河道里兴建一个节制闸，但由于工程大，全社二千多整劳力全部出动，也需要三个多月时间才能建成；建闸的器材费用需要十三万元，相当于全社1957年生产费用的总和。所以，一直没有修建。在水利条件较好的平原地区，除沿淠河、西河、洪桥河两岸的八万亩土地有水灌溉外，还有四万多亩地因小社无力兴修大型引水渠道，沟塘蓄水量少，也经常受旱。
    公社建成后，首先打破了原来农业社的界限，进行了统一规划，有计划地兴办各种较大的水利工程。去冬今春，全社共组织了九千多人，投入兴修水利的战斗，分别在东南到东北部高岗地开挖了两道干渠，全长六十五华里，共做土方工程二百二十万公方。原来小社无力兴建的杨仙铺节制闸，办公社以后，立即组织力量，依靠群众筹集资金和器材，经过几个月来的施工，目前已经完成了建闸任务。在平原地区，着重挖开引水沟、整修原有塘坝，全社共整修较大的沟塘四百五十处，开挖引水渠二百多条，兴建涵闸十二处，在河渠之间又修了十二道引水渠。现在除了南部边缘的淠河以外，其余几条较大的河流、渠道，已相互沟通，纵横交错，初步形成了一个新的灌溉体系。经过几个月来的水利建设，不仅彻底解决了四万亩土地的涝害，同时还扩大灌溉面积八万亩，自流灌溉的面积也由原来的五万亩增加到八万亩。这些工程，在当前的抗旱斗争中，已经发挥了很大的作用。社员们说：“大河是公社挖的，大闸是公社修的，丰收是公社带来的”。
    大规模地改良土壤，也是爱国公社建成后进行的一项较大的农田基本建设。这个社共有澄白土、沙浆土、死黄土、黑粘土等贫瘠土地三万亩，这些土地不仅难犁难耙，同时不耐水、不耐旱，一般亩产只有一百斤左右，群众都称为“三挑秧、一挑稻，兔子不拉屎的薄地”。这些薄地又集中分布在高家湖、廖家湖、西北湖以及东南部高岗地带。改良这些地的土壤，费工很大，原来的农业社，由于劳、畜力的限制，无法进行这项工作。如东风大队（原来是一个农业社）就有成片的劣等土地三千八百亩，如果要改良这些地的土壤，全大队的劳力要干一个月。原爱国农业社有劣等土地一万二千亩，但全社只有七百四十条耕牛，如果把畜力用在改良土壤工作上，就会耽误冬耕和春耕。公社成立后，采取大协作的办法，从全社范围内组织劳力二万多人，三千头耕牛，结合兴修水利和积肥，用“兑”（沙土、粘土相兑）、“压”（压沟塘泥）、“烧”（就地烧土包）以及结合深耕、增施有机肥料等办法，改变土壤结构。经过改良的土壤，现在庄稼长得都比过去好，社员们高兴地说：“公社力量大，薄地也长出了好庄稼”。
    爱国公社还组织了一万二千多劳力和一千多头耕畜，开垦荒地一万三千多亩，添置了拖拉机两部、抽水机等大型机械六部，兴修了小型发电站一处，这些都是公社成立以前无法办到的。　（寿县县委通讯组）（附图片）
