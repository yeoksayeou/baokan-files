    Flying Horse Takes the Field to Increase Production of Power Station Boilers
    Wuhan Boiler Factory Fully Enters Production
    (Report from this newspaper) The first phase of construction of a modern power station boiler manufacturing plant – the Wuhan Boiler Factory – has been fully completed and has comprehensively entered production, beginning a new stage of the second phase of construction. From now on, this factory will be able to comprehensively manufacture various types of power station boilers.
    The Wuhan Boiler Factory was designed by China itself. It is the second newly built modern power station boiler manufacturing plant in China, following the Harbin Boiler Factory, which went into production in 1957. The state required that the first phase of the project be completed and fully put into production by the end of this year. Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, especially after the publication of the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the builders were filled with soaring enthusiasm, and finally completed the first phase of construction three and a half months ahead of schedule and comprehensively entered production.
    This factory is now mass-producing power station boilers with a steam evaporation capacity of 35 tons per hour. This type of boiler is one of the three major pieces of equipment comprising a 6,000 kilowatt power station, and is also trial-producing medium-pressure power station boilers with a steam evaporation capacity of 120 tons per hour to support 25,000 kilowatt power stations.
    During the survey and design process, this factory received guidance from Czechoslovak experts, and during the construction process, it continuously received assistance from Soviet experts.
    Currently, this factory is organizing a new upsurge of double leap forward in production and construction. All factory workers are working towards one goal: to complete the trial manufacture of boiler steam drums and one medium-pressure 120-ton/hour power station boiler before the end of September, and strive to complete the September production plan five days ahead of schedule, to greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with new achievements.

    飞马上阵增产电站锅炉
    武汉锅炉厂全面投入生产
    本报讯　一座现代化的电站锅炉制造厂——武汉锅炉厂的第一期建设工程已经全部竣工，全面投入了生产，开始进入第二期工程建设的新阶段。从此，这个厂能够全面地制造各种型号电站锅炉了。
    武汉锅炉厂是我国自行设计的，它是继1957年投入生产的哈尔滨锅炉厂之后建成的我国第二个新建的现代化电站锅炉制造厂。国家要求第一期工程在今年年底建成全面投入生产。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，特别是党的八届八中全会公报发表后，建设者们鼓足了冲天的干劲，终于提前三个半月完成了第一期建设工程，全面投入了生产。
    这座厂现在已在成批地制造每小时蒸发量三十五吨的电站锅炉，这种锅炉是组成六千瓩电站设备的三大主机之一，同时还在试制配合二万五千瓩电站设备的每小时蒸发量一百二十吨的中压电站锅炉。
    这个厂在勘察设计过程中，曾得到捷克斯洛伐克专家的指导，在建设过程中，又不断得到苏联专家的帮助。
    现在，这个厂正在组织一个新的生产、建设双跃进的高潮。全厂职工朝着一个目标：决心在9月底以前完成锅炉汽包和一台中压一百二十吨／时电站锅炉的试制任务，争取提前五天完成9月份生产计划，以新的成绩迎接建国十周年。
