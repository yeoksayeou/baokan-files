    Farmer Parachutist Wen Jinhua
    Wen Jinhua, an 18-year-old parachutist from Hunan Province participating in the National Games, was a rural youth who had never even seen a parachute eight months ago. However, on the 12th, in the men's daytime 600-meter individual precision jump competition of the First National Games, he broke the national record of 10.73 meters set in 1958 with an average distance of 3.9 meters from the center of the target, earning him third place in the event.

    Wen Jinhua is a youth shock brigade leader from the Taohuayuan People's Commune in Taoyuan County, Hunan Province. He usually enjoys sports, participating in basketball and maintaining a healthy physique through exercise.

    He was very nervous when he first participated in parachuting. After the parachute opened, he forgot all the things the instructor taught him about wind speed, wind direction, sideslip, turning, braking… In the end, he and his parachute crossed the ground target and flew out of the airport, landing near a village. The villagers greeted this sky-borne guest with surprised expressions. He got a zero score this time. Comrades helped him, and the Party encouraged him: as long as you work hard, you will definitely master this skill. He did not lose heart and persisted in practicing in his spare time.

    Afterward, Wen Jinhua worked hard. He constantly thought about parachuting problems, practiced parachuting movements, and his bed, chairs, stools, platforms… everywhere became his practice “field.” Sometimes he would even walk around with his arms outstretched, repeatedly experiencing the feeling of free fall in the air.

    In the Hunan, Henan, Anhui, and Shaanxi four-province parachuting friendship competition held in Henan in August, Wen Jinhua won first place in the men's daytime 1,500-meter individual combined parachuting event.

    At the National Games, he was determined to create even better results. In addition to practicing himself, he also watched other excellent athletes practice and asked them to share their experiences. In this way, his athletic performance was further consolidated and improved. On the 12th, his score for the first jump was 1.15 meters, and the second jump was 6.65 meters because he pulled the control strap too hard, averaging 3.9 meters.

    Now he says he wants to further improve his skills and strive to create even better results.

    Female Jockey Qing Saima Wins Two Championships

    On the grounds of the horse racing, obstacle racing, and polo competitions of the National Games held in Hohhot, a chestnut horse suddenly stood out from the crowd. As the crowd's eyes focused, shouts of "Qing Saima, Qing Saima!" immediately rang out across the field. Qing Saima, astride the chestnut horse, held the reins in her left hand and the whip in her right, her body pressed tightly against the horse's back, shooting forward like a meteor. Finally, she won the national championship in the women's Group B 2,000-meter horse race with a time of two minutes, thirty-one and two-tenths of a second. She also won another championship in the women's Group B 1,000-meter horse race with a time of one minute and nine and eight-tenths of a second.

    Qing Saima, a sixteen-year-old Mongolian girl, grew up in the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area of Bairin Left Banner in Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In 1956, when she was in elementary school in her hometown, she began practicing riding techniques. Because she grew up in a brave and skilled equestrian herding family on the grasslands, she had a brave and tenacious character from a young age. When she first learned to ride a horse, she was small and had to be supported by adults. She often fell off her horse during practice, but she was not discouraged and persisted in practicing. Every day at dawn, she came to the training ground, stepping on the cold dewdrops of the frontier, and began to train. She quickly mastered the basic riding techniques and gradually became an excellent jockey.

    The brave Qing Saima is not only a multiple champion in the National Games horse racing competition but also an accurate and skilled stunt rider. When she stands upright on the shoulders of another male rider and makes a flying pose, rushing past the audience like lightning, her colorful clothes filled with the force of the wind, rustling, her graceful posture is like a swift passing through the air, making people exclaim at her superb skill.

    From Serf's Daughter to Excellent Jockey

    On September 12th, the women's Group B high jump obstacle race of the First National Games began. When Man Zhuoma, a Tibetan girl from Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, jumped her horse over a height of more than one meter, the audience present applauded for her, congratulating her on her new achievements in the competition.

    Man Zhuoma won seventh place in the women's Group B high jump obstacle race.

    Ten years ago, when Man Zhuoma followed her father as a serf for the feudal headman, she secretly watched horse races. From that time on, the young and innocent Man Zhuoma fantasized about riding a tall steed and participating in a horse racing competition. But as the daughter of a serf under cruel feudal rule, where could she find a horse to ride!

    After liberation, Man Zhuoma's family had their own livestock with the help of national loans. Since then, she has often ridden horses on the grasslands to graze her livestock. During several years of grazing, the brave and resourceful Man Zhuoma became an excellent equestrian athlete through arduous training. Last year, she won first place in the 5,000-meter race at the horse race in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.

    A month ago, Man Zhuoma came to Hohhot to participate in the National Games horse racing competition and temporarily signed up for the high jump obstacle race. She had never learned to jump high obstacles before, and the horse was not used to jumping either. It often stopped in front of the high obstacles, sometimes stopping so abruptly that it threw her off the horse. But Man Zhuoma was not intimidated by these difficulties. She continued to practice after falling off her horse. Late at night, she was still enthusiastically practicing riding postures and jumping movements on a stool as if it were a saddle, as well as the clamping force of her legs. Soon, her technique improved greatly, and she could jump over a height of 1.2 meters. But Man Zhuoma was not complacent about this. Seeing that the Mongolian female rider Wuyun Qimuge from the Inner Mongolia team jumped even higher than her, she humbly learned from her. This greatly improved Man Zhuoma's technique.

    Women's Springboard Diving Champion Zhou Xiyang

    Zhou Xiyang is a junior high school student at Beijing No. 11 Middle School, wearing a red scarf and full of naivete. A year ago, she didn't even know what "diving" was, but on September 16th, she leapt to the standard of a Master of Sports, becoming the national women's springboard diving champion with a total score of 136.64 points.

    What attracted her most at first was gymnastics, with its emphasis on artistic beauty. On one accidental occasion, she watched a diving competition and saw some diving experts making various beautiful movements in the air and diving into the water. She fell in love with diving.

    To learn to dive, you must first know how to swim. But she knew nothing about swimming. From the beginning, she showed a spirit of not fearing difficulties and vowing not to give up until she achieved her goal. Learning to swim inevitably meant swallowing some water, and sometimes she choked so much that tears flowed, but she still insisted on learning. After two lessons, she began to get on the diving board. During the learning process, she was very serious and hardworking. In order to increase the coordination and beauty of her movements, she arranged ballet training in addition to specialized training.

    Not long ago, when she was learning to do an inward one-and-a-half somersault, she jumped from the ten-meter platform. Because she didn't master the timing of unfolding her body, she collided with the surface of the water, and her skin was bruised red. The coach told her to rest, but she wanted to continue jumping, determined to succeed. It was this perseverance and courage that made her technique progress rapidly. In April of this year, she reached the level of a second-class athlete, in July she reached the level of a first-class athlete, and this time she leapt to become the second youngest Master of Sports in our country.

    运动场上的新手
    农民跳伞运动员文进华
    全国运动会湖南省十八岁的飞机跳伞运动员文进华，八个月前还是个连降落伞也没见过的农村青年，但12日在第一届全国运动会男子日间六百米单人定点跳伞比赛中，竟以平均距圆心三米九的成绩，打破了1958年十米七三的全国纪录，被录取为这项运动的第三名。
    文进华是湖南省桃源县桃花源人民公社的一个青年突击队长。平常他很喜爱体育运动，参加篮球运动，身体锻炼得相当健康。
    第一次参加跳伞时，他是很紧张的。降落伞打开以后，他把教员讲的什么风速、风向、侧滑、转身、刹车……，一时全忘了，结果连人带伞越过了地面的圆跳靶，飞出了机场，落在一个村子附近。村子里的人带着惊奇的眼神，来迎接这位从天而降的飞客。这一次得了个零分。同志们帮助他，党鼓励他：只要下苦功夫，就一定能够掌握这项本领。他自己没有气馁，坚持业余练习。
    以后，文进华刻苦下功夫。经常考虑跳伞问题，练习跳伞动作，床铺、椅、凳、平台……到处都是他的练习“场地”，有时走路还伸开两手，反复体会在空中自由坠落的姿势。
    8月在河南举行的湖南、河南、安徽、陕西四省跳伞友谊赛中，文进华在男子日间一千五百米单人综合跳伞项目里得了第一名。
    在全国运动会上他立志要创造更好的成绩，除了自己练习以外，还要看别的优秀运动员练习，请他们介绍经验，这样，他的运动成绩就进一步巩固和提高了。12日他第一次跳伞的成绩是一米十五，第二次操纵带拉重了一把，跳了个六米六五，平均是三米九。
    现在他表示要进一步提高本领，争取创造更高的成绩。

    夺得两项冠军的女骑手青赛玛
    在呼和浩特举行的全国运动会赛马、障碍赛马和马球比赛的场地上，刹那间，一匹枣骝小马超群而出，随着群众视线所集，“青赛玛，青赛玛！”的欢呼声，立刻响遍了全场。只见跨驰枣骝小马的青赛玛，左手揽缰，右手持鞭，将全身紧贴马背，像流星似地直射向前。终于她以二分三十一秒二的成绩夺得了女子乙组二千米赛马的全国冠军。她在女子乙组一千米赛马中，也以一分九秒八的成绩获得了另一个冠军。
    十六岁的蒙古族姑娘青赛玛，在内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟半农半牧区的巴林左旗长大。1956年她在家乡念小学时，就开始练习骑马技术。由于她自幼生活在草原上一个骁勇善骑的牧民家庭，自小有着勇敢顽强的性格。当她初学骑马时因年纪小，要由大人扶，练习时还经常滚鞍落马，但她并不灰心，坚持进行练习。每天黎明，踏着塞外冰冷的露珠，来到练马场上，开始锻炼，很快就掌握了骑马的基本技术，逐步变成了一名优秀的骑手。
    勇敢的青赛玛，不仅是全国运动会赛马比赛中的多项冠军获得者，而且也是一位准确、娴熟的优秀特技骑手。当她直立于另一男骑手的肩头之上作展翅飞翔的姿势，风驰电掣般地由观众眼前疾驰而过时，她那鼓满劲风的彩色衣裳，呼呼作响，优美的风姿，恰如掠空而过的海燕，使人叹为绝技。（张平亚）
    从农奴女儿到优秀骑手
    9月12日，第一届全国运动会障碍赛马女子乙组超越高障碍比赛开始，一位来自青海省海北藏族自治州的藏族姑娘满卓玛，纵马跳过了一米以上高度的时候，在场的观众都为她鼓掌，祝贺她在比赛中取得的新成绩。
    满卓玛获得女子乙组高障碍赛马的第七名。
    十年前，满卓玛跟随她的父亲给封建头人当农奴时，曾偷偷地观看过赛马会，从那时候起，幼小天真的满卓玛就幻想着骑上高大的骏马参加赛马大会。但是在残酷封建统治下的农奴的女儿，那里能有马可骑啊！
    解放后满卓玛的家庭在国家贷款扶助下，有了自己的牲畜，从此她便常年骑马在草原上放牧自己的牲畜。在几年的放牧中，勇敢机智的满卓玛，经过艰苦锻炼，成了一个优秀的马术运动员。去年在青海省海北藏族自治州的赛马会上，她曾获得了五千米的第一名。
    一个月以前，满卓玛来到呼和浩特参加全国运动会的赛马比赛，临时报名参加高障碍赛马。过去她没有学过跳高障碍，马也不习惯跳，往往跑到高障碍前就停下来，有时停得太猛，将她从马上摔下来。但是满卓玛没有被这些困难吓倒，摔下来又继续上马练习。到了夜深人静，她仍兴趣盎然地把凳子当作马鞍子，骑在凳子上练习骑坐姿势和起跳的动作，以及两腿的夹力。不久，她在技术上终于有了很大的提高，可以跳过一米二十的高度了。但是满卓玛没有以此自满，她看见内蒙古队蒙古族女骑手乌云其木格比她跳得更高，就虚心地向她学习。这样使满卓玛在技术上有了很大的提高。（廖由滨）
    女子跳板跳水冠军周希洋
    周希洋是北京第十一中初二的学生，系上红领巾，稚气十足。一年以前还不知道“跳水”是怎么回事，9月16日却一跃达到了运动健将标准，成为全国女子跳板跳水冠军，总成绩是一百三十六点六四分。
    最早吸引她的是讲究造型艺术美的体操运动。在一次偶然的机会里，她看了一次跳水比赛，看到一些跳水能手在空中做出各种美妙的动作跃入水中，她又爱上了跳水。
    要学跳水先得会游泳。可她对游泳却一窍不通。一开始她就表现了不怕困难、不达目的誓不休的精神。学游泳免不了要喝些水，有时呛得眼泪都流出来了，她还是坚持学下去。两次课后她就开始上跳板。在学习过程中，她非常认真刻苦。为了增加动作协调的美，她除了专项练习，还安排了芭蕾舞的练习。
    不久前，她在学习向内翻腾一周半时，从十米跳台上跳下来，因为没掌握好展开身体的时间，和水面相碰了，皮肤摔得通红，教练让她休息，她却要继续再跳，一定要跳成功。就是这种毅力和勇敢，使她的技术进步很快，今年4月，达到二级运动员标准，7月就达到一级运动员标准，而这一次又一跃成为我国第二个年龄最小的运动健将。
