Achieving Water Conservancy: Great Harvests Even in Drought

Yuxi County Builds a Long Vine and Melon-Style Water Network to Prevent Drought Years

Tianmen County's Shihe Commune Cooperates to Develop New Water Sources, Winning a Bumper Harvest of Mid-Season Rice

This newspaper, Kunming, 3rd: The "long vine and melon" style farmland water conservancy network newly built by the people's communes in Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, is playing a significant role in the current struggle against drought, ensuring that the county's crops are not affected by drought in dry years.

This year, just as the rice was budding and developing ears, the county experienced a continuous drought for more than forty days. Over 80% of the mid-season rice and flue-cured tobacco were seriously threatened by the drought. However, thanks to the timely release of water from large and small reservoirs throughout the county, various crops were generally irrigated. Currently, the county's 100,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco has begun to be harvested and baked, with average yields per mu increasing by about 50% compared to last year. The 150,000 mu of mid-season rice are generally growing with large ears and full grains, holding great hope for a bumper harvest.

During the Great Leap Forward last year, the people of Yuxi County built sixteen medium and large-sized reservoirs and more than a thousand small-scale water conservancy projects, with a water storage capacity that could irrigate over 200,000 mu of farmland, which is 1.9 times the total water conservancy construction in the eight years since liberation. After communization, the communes throughout the county launched a new upsurge in water conservancy construction last winter and this spring. A network of reservoirs connected by ditches and canals was built throughout the county, forming a "long vine and melon" style water conservancy network. As a result, the county's water storage capacity reached over 240 million cubic meters, which can irrigate over 311,000 mu of farmland, accounting for 83% of the county's total cultivated land.

Because the county has basically completed the construction of the farmland water conservancy network, it has achieved drought resistance in dry years. Over 120,000 mu of mid-season rice and over 80,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco that showed signs of drought were timely provided with water to protect the seedlings. The communes mobilized twenty-six water pumps and more than six hundred waterwheels to pump water, solving the problem of water for seedling protection in some of the higher fields. In the past, when faced with such drought conditions, an average of 30% to 40% of the county's labor force had to be invested in water carrying and drought resistance, thus often missing the best time for weeding and topdressing. This year, many communes no longer need to carry water for drought resistance and are fully invested in the later-stage processing and management of rice. All rice fields have been weeded three times, and an average of several thousand catties of topdressing fertilizer have been applied per mu. The masses are saying: "For decades, we have never seen the weeds in the fields weeded so cleanly and meticulously. Truly, 'With communization, we lay a foundation for ten thousand years; with water conservancy, we have great harvests even in drought.'" (Ma Lie)

This newspaper, Wuhan, 3rd: The Shihe Commune in Tianmen County, Hubei Province, has vigorously organized cooperation and extensively developed water sources, constantly achieving victory in the struggle against drought.

The Shihe Commune has rolling hills and a shortage of water sources, and in the past, it mainly grew dryland crops. In recent years, with large-scale water conservancy construction, the area of paddy fields has increased. This year, it suffered a severe drought. Thanks to the spirit of cooperation among the management areas and production teams, they were able to adjust and allocate water to each other, finally winning a bumper harvest of mid-season rice. However, most of the late rice is still under the threat of drought, and some seedlings have turned yellow and withered. Under the organization and leadership of the commune, the entire commune has launched a crash water conservancy construction movement, continuing to fight the drought.

The entire commune organized more than 15,000 laborers, with the spirit of splitting mountains and breaking ridges, to open canals around the mountains and develop new water sources. The Xinmin Management Area has nine ridges and is a place with relatively few water sources. The management area cadres decided to open a winding canal along the long ridge to divert water for irrigation. After three days of hard work, the canal was built, and more than 6,800 mu of single-season late rice were generally irrigated. The Fenjin Management Area has the worst water source conditions in the entire commune, and the drought situation is particularly serious. The management area planned to divert water from the Sudu River north of Longwei Mountain for irrigation, but the mountain was high and the cliffs were steep, and the project was arduous. After unified planning by the commune, a portion of the labor force was drawn from other management areas to provide support, and in just four days, they split open Longwei Mountain and opened a twelve-li long canal, diverting water from the Sudu River to irrigate more than 8,400 mu of rice. The commune members joyfully sang: "Longwei Mountain turns itself over, the mountain connects to the water, the water connects to the mountain, we open mountains and split ridges to build big canals, divert water for irrigation to ensure increased production." During this period, the entire commune successively split mountains and broke ridges on Longwei Mountain to build five water conservancy projects, increasing the irrigated area by approximately 44,000 mu.

Under the unified leadership of the commune, the management areas and production teams also assisted the management areas and production teams with difficulties in the spirit of "sharing weal and woe." The Democratic and Shihe Management Areas had better water source conditions. After education by the Party General Branch, the commune members voluntarily proposed to take out a portion of their water to give to the Xinmin and Fenjin Management Areas, which had water source difficulties, to help irrigate 15,000 mu of fields. The masses of the Second Team of the Shifeng Management Area not only gave their team's water to the Fifth Team for irrigation but also voluntarily took out tables, benches, door panels, etc., to help the Fifth Team build a nearly two-li long sky trough, introducing the lake water into the drought-stricken fields.

    实现水利化  大旱也丰收
    玉溪县修成长藤结瓜式水网作到了旱年不旱
    天门县石河公社协作增辟水源赢得中稻丰收
    本报昆明3日电　云南玉溪县各人民公社新修的长藤结瓜式农田水利网，在当前抗旱斗争中发挥了很大的作用，保证了全县农作物在旱年不受旱。
    今年，正当稻谷含苞孕穗期间，全县旱象持续了四十多天，中稻和烤烟有80％以上受到严重旱灾威胁。但由于全县大小水库适时放水，各种作物普遍得到灌溉。现在，全县十万亩烤烟已开始摘叶烘烤，每亩单产平均都比去年增加了50％左右。十五万多亩中稻，一般都长得穗大粒饱，大有丰收希望。
    去年大跃进中，玉溪县人民兴修了中型和较大型的水库十六个，小型水利一千多个，蓄水量能灌溉农田二十多万亩，为解放八年来兴修水利总和的一点九倍。公社化以后，全县各公社又在去冬今春掀起了兴修水利的新高潮。县境内修建了沟渠相通的水库群，形成长藤结瓜式的水利网。至此，全县蓄水量达二亿四千多万方，可灌溉农田三十一万一千多亩，占全县总耕地的83％。
    全县由于基本上完成了农田水利网的建设，作到了旱年不旱。出现旱象的十二万多亩中稻和八万多亩烤烟都及时地放了保苗水。各公社抽调了二十六部抽水机，六百多台水车抽水，解决了部分高田的保苗用水问题。过去碰到这样的旱情，全县平均要有30％到40％的劳力投入车水抗旱工作，因此，往往错过了薅锄追肥的最好时机。今年许多公社却再也不必车水抗旱，全力投入了稻谷的后期加工管理。全部稻田已经薅完了三道草，平均每亩施了几千斤追肥。群众都说：几十年来，没有见过田里的杂草薅锄得这样干净细致，真是“有了公社化，栽下万年桩，实现水利化，大旱也丰收。”（马烈）
    本报武汉3日电　湖北省天门县石河公社大力组织协作和广辟水源，在抗旱斗争中不断地获得胜利。
    石河公社岗岭纵横，水源缺乏，过去以种旱作物为主。近年大修水利，水田增多。今年，这里遭受严重的干旱。由于各管理区和生产队发扬协作精神，相互调剂用水，终于赢得了中稻丰收。可是，绝大部分晚稻都处在干旱威胁中，部分秧苗已秆黄叶枯。在公社的组织领导下，全社又开展了突击兴修水利运动，继续大战干旱。
    全公社组织了一万五千多个劳力，以劈山破岭的气概，盘山开渠，增辟水源。新民管理区有九条岗岭，是水源较少的地方。管理区干部决定在沿长岗岭开一条盘山渠，引水灌田。经过三天的苦战，就把这条渠道修成了，使六千八百多亩一季晚稻普遍灌上了水。坟禁管理区是全公社水源最差的地方，受旱情况特别严重。这个管理区计划从龙尾山北边的苏渡河引水灌溉，但山高壁陡，工程艰巨。经公社统一筹划，从其他管理区抽出一部分劳力给以支援后，仅四天就劈开了龙尾山，开了一条十二里长的渠道，引苏渡河的水灌了八千四百多亩水稻。社员们欢乐地歌唱着：“龙尾山、把身翻，山连水、水连山，开山劈岭修大渠，引水灌田保增产。”这期间，全公社先后在龙尾山劈山破岭增修了五处水利工程，增加灌溉面积大约四万四千多亩。
    在公社的统一领导下，各管理区和生产队也都以“患难相共”的精神，援助有困难的管理区和生产队。民主、石河两个管理区水源条件较好，经过党总支的教育，社员们主动提出拿出一部分水给水源困难的新民、坟禁两管理区，帮助灌田一万五千亩。石丰管理区二队的群众，不仅把本队的水让给五队灌田，还自动拿出桌、凳、门板等，帮助五队架起了约二里长的一座天涧，将湖水引入受旱田里。　（李金锴）
