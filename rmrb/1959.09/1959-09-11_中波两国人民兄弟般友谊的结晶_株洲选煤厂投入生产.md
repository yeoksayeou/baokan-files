Xinhua News Agency, Zhuzhou, September 9th: The modern Zhuzhou Coal Preparation Plant officially went into production on the 8th and held a grand opening ceremony.

This large-scale coal preparation plant, which began construction in the first half of 1957, was built with the assistance of the People's Republic of Poland. It can wash 1.8 million tons of raw coal into coking coal concentrate annually. Thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of all builders under the leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the entire project was put into production more than a month ahead of schedule.

    据新华社株洲9日电　现代化的株洲选煤厂8日正式投入生产，并且举行了隆重的开工典礼。
    这座在1957年上半年动工的大型选煤厂，是波兰人民共和国帮助我国建设的，它每年能把一百八十万吨原煤洗选成为炼焦精煤。由于全体建设者在党的领导和总路线的光辉照耀下发挥了冲天干劲，整个工程投入生产的时间比原计划缩短了一个多月。
    煤炭工业部副部长钟子云以及中共湖南省委委员、湖南省副省长徐明，中共株洲市委书记孙天彪等省市负责人参加了这个工厂的开工典礼。
    参加典礼的，还有应我国煤炭工业部邀请的以波兰采煤和动力工业部部长扬·米特伦加为首的波兰煤矿代表团全体成员，波兰驻华大使馆临时代办傅拉托，以及现驻株洲选煤厂的波兰专家工作组组长特·格文伯克等全体专家。波兰煤矿代表团是昨天上午零点二十九分到达株洲的，他们受到湖南省、株洲市党政负责人的热烈欢迎。选煤厂基建单位的代表和选煤厂的全体生产职工，像过节日一样地参加了典礼。
