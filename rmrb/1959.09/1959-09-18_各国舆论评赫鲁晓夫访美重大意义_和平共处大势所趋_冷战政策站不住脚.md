Xinhua News Agency dispatch: News from around the world: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's visit to the United States has become the focus of attention for public opinion in various countries. Newspapers in many countries have published commentaries, pointing out the great significance of this visit.
    The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published an editorial saying that people believe that the meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower is a victory for the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy.
    The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial saying that Eisenhower once said that he wanted to thaw the "ice" of the "Cold War." People all over the world expect the US President to fulfill this promise and make it possible to find concrete solutions to some urgent and important issues.
    Czechoslovakia's "Rude Pravo" welcomed Khrushchev's visit to the United States in an editorial. The editorial said that the Czechoslovak people hope that this visit will bring good and beneficial results, and that an era of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the two existing systems will replace the situation of world instability and tension.
    Hungary's "Népszabadság" pointed out in an editorial that the changing balance of world power is increasingly favorable to the front of defending peace, and increasingly demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system. People who love peaceful labor and advocate peaceful competition welcome this change in the world situation and Khrushchev's visit to the United States. The broad masses of the Hungarian people hope and wish Khrushchev's visit to the United States success.
    Poland's "Trybuna Ludu" published an editorial saying that we hope that this meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower will open up a completely new prospect for the whole world. The editorial said that there is no need to explain why we are concerned about the smooth progress of the Washington talks. Like Poland and other socialist countries, its future, development and progress are linked to the hope of lasting peace and peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems.
    Romania's "Scînteia" published a commentary saying that the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower have been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world. This shows that the mutual visits and talks between the Soviet and American leaders meet the objective needs of our times. The "Cold War" policy is no longer tenable, and the people of all countries demand that this visit take a decisive step in eliminating the dangers of the "Cold War" and restoring normal relations between countries.
    Iraq's "Sawt Al Ahrar" wrote in an article entitled "Khrushchev and Eisenhower's Mutual Visits Benefit Newly Independent Countries" that the meeting of the leaders of the two major powers will once again prove that all international disputes can and should be resolved by peaceful means, and that intimidation policies and threats cannot be used on the international stage.
    The article said that the meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower "will also help those countries that have recently gained independence and are now advancing along the road of consolidating their freedom, because it will convince some people in these countries who advocate joining military blocs that this approach is dangerous."
    The Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial on the 17th, pointing out that Khrushchev's visit to the United States is clearly a victory for the Soviet Union's peaceful policy. The newspaper expressed its belief that this visit will play a beneficial role in easing international tensions and consolidating world peace.
    "Akahata" reminded people that although the United States agreed to hold Soviet-US summit talks, forces within the United States that oppose easing international tensions, oppose peaceful coexistence, and advocate continuing to implement war policies still occupy a leading position. They do not want to learn from the fact that the United States' past policies have failed, and continue to violate the wishes of the people of the world, provoke wars in Laos and other places, and attempt to further intensify international tensions.
    Cuba's "Hoy" published an editorial on the first page on the 16th on Khrushchev's visit to the United States, saying that this is "the most prominent international event since World War II," and nothing can diminish the significance of this visit.
    "Hoy" emphasized that Khrushchev's visit will strengthen world peace. "Because although the forces that once promoted the vicious Foster Dulles are still at work, no one can deny that the international policy of these forces has suffered a very obvious failure in continuing to speak from a 'position of strength' and attempting to lead the world back to the 'brink of war'."
    "Hoy" concluded, "The Cuban people congratulate Prime Minister Khrushchev on his arrival in the United States, believing that this is the realization of the wishes of the people of all countries."

    各国舆论评赫鲁晓夫访美重大意义
    和平共处大势所趋  冷战政策站不住脚
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对美国的访问已成为各国舆论注意的中心。许多国家的报纸发表评论，指出这次访问的重大意义。
    蒙古“真理报”发表社论说，人们认为赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔举行会见是苏联和平外交政策的胜利。
    德意志民主共和国“新德意志报”发表社论说，艾森豪威尔曾经说过要使“冷战”的“冰块”解冻。全世界人民都期待美国总统实践这一诺言，并使一些迫切的重要问题有可能得到具体解决。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”在社论中表示欢迎赫鲁晓夫访问美国。社论说，捷克斯洛伐克人民希望这次访问能带来良好有益的结果，现有的两种制度之间和平共处与和平竞赛的时代将代替世界不稳定和紧张的局面。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”在社论中指出，世界力量对比的变化日益有利于保卫和平的阵线，日益显示着社会主义制度的优势。爱好和平劳动，主张和平竞赛的人们都欢迎这种世界局势的变化和赫鲁晓夫访问美国。匈牙利广大人民希望并祝赫鲁晓夫访美获得成功。
    波兰“人民论坛报”发表社论说，我们希望赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的这次会见为全世界打开全新的前景。社论说，我们所以关心华盛顿会谈的顺利进展是无须解释的。波兰和其他社会主义国家一样，它的未来、发展和进步是和持久和平以及各个不同社会制度国家和平共处的希望相联系的。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”发表评论说，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的互相访问受到了全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎，这说明苏美领导人的互访和会谈符合我们时代的客观需要，“冷战”政策已经站不住脚了，各国人民要求这次访问能在消除“冷战”危险和恢复国家间正常关系方面迈出决定性的一步。
    伊拉克“自由人之声报”在题为“赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔互相访问有利于不久前获得独立的国家”的一篇文章中写道，两大国领导人的会见将再一次证明，一切国际争端能够也应该用和平的方法解决，在国际舞台上不能使用恐吓政策和制造威胁。
    这篇文章说，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的会见“也将会有助于那些不久前获得独立、现在正沿着巩固自己的自由的道路上前进的国家，因为这会使这些国家里主张参加军事集团的一些人相信，这种方针是危险的”。
    日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”17日发表社论指出，赫鲁晓夫访问美国显然是苏联的和平政策的胜利。报纸表示相信这次访问将在缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平方面起有益的作用。
    “赤旗报”提醒人们，虽然美国同意举行苏美首脑会谈，但是在美国国内反对缓和国际紧张局势、反对和平共处、主张继续执行战争政策的势力仍然占着领导地位。它们并不想从美国过去所执行的政策遭到失败的事实中吸取教训，继续违背世界人民的愿望，在老挝等地挑起战争，企图使国际紧张局势进一步加剧。
    古巴“今日报”16日在第一版就赫鲁晓夫访问美国发表社论说，这是“第二次世界大战以来最突出的国际事件”，没有任何东西能贬低这次访问的意义。
    “今日报”强调指出，赫鲁晓夫这次访问将加强世界和平。“因为虽然曾经推动凶恶的福斯特·杜勒斯的势力仍然在起作用，但是任何人也不会否认：这种势力的国际政策在继续从‘实力地位’说话以及企图把世界再一次引向‘战争边缘’方面遭到了非常明显的失败。”
    “今日报”最后说，“古巴人民祝贺赫鲁晓夫总理到达美国，认为这是实现了各国人民的愿望。”
