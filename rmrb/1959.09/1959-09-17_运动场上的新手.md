    Newcomers on the Sports Field
    Hammer Throw Champion Zhang Yankai
    Zhang Yankai, the hammer throw champion, is a strong young man, 1.77 meters tall and weighing 86 kilograms.

    Zhang Yankai is twenty-two years old this year. Before the end of 1956, he was a weightlifter, and he effortlessly reached the standard of a third-level weightlifter. Later, he fell in love with the hammer throw. At the end of 1957, he participated in the National Track and Field Championships for the first time, throwing more than 35 meters, ranking eighth in Group B (only six were selected at that time). He was not discouraged and worked even harder. Three months later, he achieved sixth place in the 1958 National Spring Track and Field Championships with a score of 40.85 meters.

    Zhang Yankai is a graduate of the Foundry Engineering Department of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and his studies are very demanding. In order to prepare for the National Games, he still tried to find time to practice the hammer throw, especially strengthening his strength training. Bi Hongfu, the national record holder in the hammer throw, also enthusiastically helped him correct his poor frequency and flaws in his release of the hammer. As a result, his physical fitness and technique have improved significantly.

    At this National Games, he was very nervous at the beginning because his competition results were always worse than his practice results. He tried to calm down and decided to strive for excellent results. On his fifth throw, he finally jumped to the championship with a score of 51.66 meters.

    Female Javelin Thrower Han Juyuan
    "? ! ? ! ? ! ..." After a few crisp steps, a javelin flew away with the wind with a "whoosh". Accurate run-up, fast release, neat. This is the moment when Han Juyuan, a female javelin thrower from Beijing and a student at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, who won the women's javelin championship at the National Games, throws the javelin.

    Han Juyuan, a girl with a height of 1.65 meters and a weight of 64 kilograms, liked to throw stones when she was a child and loved sports activities, so she gradually developed strength that surpassed other children. In 1956, she started practicing the javelin. In the same year, she represented Beijing in the first National Junior Games and won the women's javelin championship with a score of 32.99 meters. Last year, she went to university, and after systematically undergoing physical training, her physique was greatly strengthened. Also last year, she won the javelin and hand grenade championships at the National University Games for Beijing and reached the standard of a first-level athlete. This year, she broke the national hand grenade record three times, creating a best score of 55.64 meters.

    She usually relies only on her arm strength during practice, and her leg strength is not used. Recently, she has focused on practicing the coordination between her legs and arms. On September 15, at the National Games, she concentrated her mind and paid attention to improving her technique at all times, finally winning the women's javelin championship. People say that she has a great future because she is not only strong but also very young, only nineteen years old.

    Race Walking Champion Li Fude
    Li Fude, the race walking champion of the First National Games, is a student at the Harbin Institute of Physical Education. He is twenty-two years old this year, tall and sturdy, weighing 67.5 kilograms and 1.87 meters tall. In the past, although he was also a track and field athlete, he only started practicing "race walking" in October last year.

    Some people think that "race walking" is boring, but Li Fude has an idea: interest is cultivated, and achievements are achieved through hard work. In the morning, evening, and even when walking or going to the street, he also reviews the courses taught by the teacher - "race walking".

    To achieve results in race walking, you need speed, endurance, and a large lung capacity. So, he started long-distance running, cross-country running. In the cold month of October, he always runs with sweat all over his body, insisting on more than an hour every day.

    In March of this year, Li Fude represented Heilongjiang Province for the first time in the National Spring Track and Field Zonal Competition held in Shanghai, taking fifth place with a score of 50 minutes and 36 seconds.

    At this National Games, he saw the performance of excellent race walking athletes from the Czech track and field team and learned a lot. He realized that his shortcomings were insufficient flexibility in his hip joints and too small a stride. Grasping these two points, Li Fude worked hard again. He continuously used auxiliary movements with wooden sticks and performed leg splits and other exercises to increase the flexibility of his body, and increased his stride from 1.85 meters to 1.933 meters through various runs and jumps, and his race walking technique was also improved. Finally, he won the 10-kilometer race walking championship in the competition.

    Li Fude is not only diligent and hardworking in sports, but also actively uses his brain, and he is also very active in learning and work.

    运动场上的新手
    链球冠军张宴凯
    获得链球冠军的张宴凯，是一个壮小伙子，身高一米七七，体重八十六公斤。
    张宴凯今年二十二岁。1956年底以前，他是一个举重运动员，他曾经毫不费力地达到举重三级运动员标准。后来，他又爱上了链球。1957年底，他第一次参加全国田径运动会，扔了三十五米多，列乙组第八名（当时取六名）。他不气馁，更加劲苦练。三个月以后，他取得了1958年全国春季田径运动会第六名，成绩是四十米八五。
    张宴凯是北京钢铁学院冶金系铸造工程专业应届毕业生，学习很紧张。为了迎接全运会，他还是想法抽空练习链球，特别加强力量的练习。链球全国纪录保持者毕鸿福也热情地帮助他改正频率不好和链球出手上的缺点，结果他的身体素质和技术都有了显著的提高。
    这次在全运会上，开始时他心情很紧张，因为他的比赛成绩总是比练习成绩差。他努力镇静下来，决心争取优良成绩。第五次试掷时，他终于以五十一米六六的成绩一跃而为冠军。
    女标枪手韩菊元
    “?！?！?！……”几声清脆的步点响过，“嗖”的一声，一只标枪随风而去。跑得准，出手快，利落。这就是获得全运会女子标枪冠军的北京女标枪选手、北京钢铁学院学生韩菊元掷标枪的一刹那。
    身高一点六五米、体重六十四公斤的姑娘韩菊元，小时候就喜欢扔石头玩，喜爱体育活动，于是她逐渐具有超过别的孩子的力量。1956年她开始练标枪，这一年她代表北京参加全国第一届少年运动会，以三十二米九九的成绩获得了女子标枪冠军。去年她上了大学，在有系统地进行身体训练以后，体质大大加强。也就是去年，她为北京争得了全国大学生运动会标枪和手榴弹冠军，并达到了一级运动员标准。今年，她三次打破手榴弹全国纪录，创造了五十五米六四的最好成绩。
    她平常在练习中往往只凭臂力，腿劲用不上。最近，她就着重练习腿臂的配合动作。9月15日在全运会上，她精神集中，随时注意改进技术，终于获得女子标枪冠军。人们都说她很有发展前途，因为她不仅体格健壮，而且还很年轻，才十九岁。
    竞走冠军李福德
    第一届全国运动会竞走冠军李福德，是哈尔滨体育学院的学生，今年二十二岁，长的修长而结实，体重六十七点五公斤，高一点八七米。过去他虽然也是个田径运动员，但练习“竞走”还是去年10月才开始的。
    有的人认为“竞走”很枯燥，但李福德却有个想法：兴趣是培养的，成绩是苦练出来的，早晨、晚上，甚至散步、上街，他也要复习老师教给的课程——“竞走”。
    竞走要出成绩，要有速度，要有耐久力，要有大的肺活量。于是，他开始了长跑，越野跑，在隆冬十月，他总是跑得满身汗水，每天坚持一个多小时。
    今年3月，李福德第一次代表黑龙江省参加了在上海举行的全国春季田径分区竞赛，以五十分三十六秒的成绩取得第五名。
    在这次全运会上，他看到了捷克田径队优秀竞走运动员的表演，学习了不少东西。他认识到自己的缺点是髋关节不够灵活和步幅太小。抓住这两环，李福德又苦练起来。他不间断地用助木作辅助动作，并进行劈腿等练习，增加身体的柔软性，通过多种跑、跳来增大步幅，由一点八五米增大到一点九三三米，竞走技术也改进了。终于，在比赛中获得了十公里竞走冠军。
    李福德不仅在体育运动中勤学苦练、善动脑筋，而且学习、工作都很积极。
