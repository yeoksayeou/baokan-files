Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesman of the Information Department of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said today that the Lao authorities are preparing to manufacture so-called "evidence" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam conducting "aggression," attempting to deceive Lao and world public opinion, in order to find excuses for the US imperialists and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to carry out armed intervention in Laos.

The spokesman recalled that Lao Foreign Minister Phoui Sananikone, on his way to the United Nations, repeatedly claimed that he possessed many "concrete evidence" regarding the so-called "aggression" by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The spokesman pointed out that, according to the BBC, the so-called "Laotian Situation Investigation Sub-Committee," which arrived in Laos on September 15, was granted two days of rest because it still had to wait for the Lao authorities to prepare documents and so-called "concrete evidence."

The spokesman asked, "What is behind this embarrassing situation?" He pointed out that this shows that their claims about the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's "aggression" are completely fabricated, and now they are trying to concoct such "evidence" for the "investigation sub-committee" in order to deceive Lao and world public opinion and to find excuses for the US imperialists and the aggressive bloc of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to carry out armed intervention in Laos.

The spokesman concluded, "This is the usual practice of the US imperialists and the like of Phoui Sananikone government. They cry 'stop thief!' while being the thief themselves, and shout 'fire!' while setting the fire themselves."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th: Premier Pham Van Dong of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a telegram to Premier Phoui Sananikone of the Royal Lao Government on September 14, protesting the continued repeated violations of the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by aircraft of the Royal Lao Government, and demanding that the Royal Lao Government immediately cease such provocative actions.

The telegram stated: "At 11:03 on September 1 this year, an aircraft of the Royal Lao Government violated the airspace of the Viet Tu Lu and Phuc Son regions of the Vinh Linh area of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; at 11:16 AM on September 11, an aircraft of the Royal Lao Government violated the airspace of the Muong Xiem area of Nghe An province of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; at 9:58 AM on September 12, an aircraft of the Royal Lao Government violated the airspace of the Thuan Chau area in the Northwest region of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; at 10:50 AM and 4:50 PM on September 12, aircraft of the Royal Lao Government violated the airspace of the Hoi Xuan area in Thanh Hoa province of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The telegram pointed out that from August 1958 to the present, there have been as many as forty-eight sorties of Royal Lao Government aircraft violating the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The telegram concluded, "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly protests the above-mentioned provocative actions and demands that the Royal Lao Government immediately cease these provocative actions. The Royal Lao Government must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences brought about by its provocative actions."

    越南外交部指出
    老挝当局在为美国干涉制造借口
    范文同总理抗议老挝飞机屡次侵犯越南领空
    新华社河内17日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南外交部新闻司发言人今天说，老挝当局正在准备制造所谓越南民主共和国进行“侵略”的“证据”，企图欺骗老挝和世界的舆论，以便为美帝国主义者和东南亚条约组织在老挝进行武装干涉寻找借口。
    发言人追述，老挝外交大臣班雅在去联合国途中曾多次声称，他持有许多关于越南民主共和国进行所谓“侵略”的“具体证据”。
    发言人指出，但是据英国广播公司透露，在9月15日到老挝的所谓“老挝局势调查小组委员会”得到两天的休息，因为它还得等待老挝当局去准备文件和所谓“具体证据”。
    发言人问道，在“这种狼狈局面的背后是什么？”他指出，这表明，他们关于越南民主共和国进行“侵略”的说法完全是捏造的，现在他们正在努力为“调查小组委员会”编造那样的“证据”，以便欺骗老挝和世界的舆论，并为美帝国主义者和东南亚条约组织侵略集团武装干涉老挝寻找借口。
    发言人最后说，“这是美帝国主义者和培·萨纳尼空政府之流的通常做法。他们做贼而大喊捉贼，自己放火而大喊救火。”
    新华社河内17日电　越南民主共和国政府总理范文同在9月14日打电报给老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空，抗议老挝王国飞机继续多次侵犯越南民主共和国的领空，并要求老挝王国政府立即停止这种挑衅行动。
    电报说：“今年9月1日十一时三分，老挝王国飞机一架侵犯了越南民主共和国永灵区越土鲁和福山两个地区的领空；9月11日上午十一时十六分，老挝王国飞机一架侵犯了越南民主共和国宜安省芒暹地区的领空；9月12日上午九时五十八分，老挝王国飞机一架侵犯了越南民主共和国西北部顺州地区的领空；9月12日上午十时五十分和下午四时五十分，老挝王国飞机侵犯了越南民主共和国清化省回春地区的领空。”
    电报指出，仅在1958年8月到现在，就有老挝王国飞机四十八架次侵犯了越南民主共和国的领空。
    电报最后说，“越南民主共和国政府坚决抗议上述挑衅行动，并要求老挝王国政府立即停止这些挑衅行动。老挝王国政府必须对它的挑衅行动所带来的严重后果负完全责任。”（附图片）
