    A Pencil Stub
    Liao Jian
    Among the revolutionary historical relics collected by the Ministry of Railways, there is a used pencil stub, sharpened to a point, only an inch or so long, connected by a string. According to the description on the card, it was used by Soviet experts when they worked on the Chinese Changchun Railway. After the Soviet Union handed over the Chinese Changchun Railway to our country without compensation, this pencil stub, like other things on the railway, was preserved by our railway bureau as a historical relic and was used to educate railway workers about thrift, playing a demonstrative role.
    Today, when the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee calls on the people of the whole country to practice increasing production and practicing economy, I can't help but think of this pencil stub again. The spirit of economy of the Soviet experts is really a good example for us to learn from. In our work, there are still many areas where we are not thrifty enough. Not long ago, the administrative section also pointed out to everyone some wasteful phenomena in office supplies, such as good sheets of paper often mixed in waste paper boxes, usable iron pen nibs, thumbtacks, paper clips, carbon paper, etc. … These seem like small things, but some people still can't do it, which shows that they are not small things. Practicing strict economy is the responsibility of everyone. Comrades who work in the office should also think carefully: How can I respond to the Party's great call? Have I achieved the due economy and care for public property? Then, you will think of that pencil stub, which is indeed a very good relic.

    一只铅笔头
    廖坚
    铁道部搜集的革命历史文物中，有一只用剩的铅笔头，削得尖尖的，只有寸来长，用一条线联着。看卡片上的说明，才知道这是过去中长铁路的苏联专家在工作中使用过的。苏联无偿地把中长铁路移交给我国以后，这只铅笔头就和铁路其他东西一样，被我们的铁路局作为历史文物保存下来了，并且用它向铁路职工进行过节约的教育，起了示范的作用。
    当今天党的八中全会号召全国人民厉行增产节约的时候，不禁又想起了这只铅笔头，苏联专家的节约精神，真是我们学习的好榜样。在我们的工作中，不够节约的地方还是很多的，不久行政科还向大家指出了对办公用品的某些浪费现象，如在废纸箱里常常夹杂着成张的好纸、能用的铁笔尖、大头针、回纹针、复写纸等……。这些看起来只是小事，但还是有人办不到，可见并不是小事。厉行节约，人人有责。我们坐办公室的同志，也应该好好想一想：我怎样响应党的伟大号召呢？我对公共财物作到了应有的节约和爱护吗？然后，你就会想到那只铅笔头，的确是一件很好的文物了。
