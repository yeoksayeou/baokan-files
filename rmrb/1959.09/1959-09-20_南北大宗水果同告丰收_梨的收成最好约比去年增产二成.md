Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Various regions report bumper harvests of autumn fruits. The output of major fruits such as pears and grapes in the north, and bananas in the south, is expected to exceed the bumper harvest of last year. The pear harvest is the best, with an estimated increase of 10% to 20% over last year. Although the main producing areas of apples in the north and citrus fruits in the south suffered from severe drought and flood disasters, the output is estimated to remain at last year's level. The harvest of pineapples in South China and dates and persimmons in North China is also good this year.

Among the famous fruits, the Hebei Ya pear (i.e., the famous Tianjin Ya pear), the Anhui Dangshan County Su pear, and the Shandong Laiyang pear are estimated to increase by 10% to several tens of percent this year. The fragrant and crisp Yantai apples are expected to increase by about 40% compared with last year. The output of Binzi in Yuanping County, Shanxi Province, has increased by two times compared with last year. Longan in Fujian, white grapes in Turpan, Longan grapes in Pingdu, Shandong, and Jinsi dates in Leling have also had bumper harvests this year.

In the newly established fruit tree bases and orchards in the old course of the Yellow River in eastern Henan and on the northern slopes of the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, the early-planted trees are also bearing abundant fruit. In the Yifeng Horticultural Farm in the old course of the Yellow River, 2 million catties of grapes have been picked from the vineyard, more than double the amount of last year. The fruit output in Inner Mongolia this year has increased nearly three times compared with last year. Herdsmen in the Xilin Gol grasslands, who could not often eat fresh fruit in the past, are now also eating various small apples and plums produced in the newly built local orchards.

In recent years, agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of China have paid great attention to the development of fruit tree production. After communization, the people's communes in most fruit-concentrated areas have organized specialized fruit tree production teams, making overall arrangements for a certain amount of manpower and materials, and strengthening the management of orchards. This year, the area of orchards watered, fertilized, and treated for disease and pest control in various regions has been significantly expanded compared with before communization.

    南北大宗水果同告丰收
    梨的收成最好约比去年增产二成
    据新华社18日讯　各地秋熟水果喜丰收。北方的梨、葡萄和南方的香蕉等大宗果品，产量可望超过大丰收的去年。梨的收成最好，约比去年增产一成到两成。北方的苹果和南方的柑桔，虽然主要产区受到了严重的旱涝灾害，但是产量估计仍可维持去年的水平。华南的菠萝和华北的枣、柿等今年的收成也不错。
    著名的水果中，河北的鸭梨（即著名的天津鸭梨）、安徽砀山县的酥梨、山东莱阳梨，今年估计分别增产一成到几成。清香脆甜的烟台苹果，今年比去年约增产四成左右。山西原平县的槟子今年产量比去年增加两倍。福建龙眼、吐鲁番白葡萄、山东平度的龙眼葡萄、乐陵的金丝小枣，今年也都丰收。
    豫东黄河故道和陕西秦岭北麓等地我国新建的果树基地和果林，早栽的树也结果累累。黄河故道仪封园艺场中，葡萄园已摘葡萄二百万斤，比去年增产一倍多。内蒙古地区今年水果比去年增产近三倍。去年常年吃不到鲜果的锡林郭勒大草原的牧民，现在也吃上了本地新建果园生产的各种小苹果和李子。
    几年来，我国各地农业生产合作社对于发展果树生产都很注意。公社化后，大部分水果集中产区的人民公社更组织果树生产专业队，统筹安排一定的人力、物力，加强了果园的经营管理。今年各地果园浇水、施肥、防治病虫害的面积都比公社化以前显著地扩大。
