Boost Enthusiasm, Strive for the Upper Reaches, Transform the Mountainous Areas
　　　　Magakeng and Houkeng Achieve Bumper Harvests, Cattle and Sheep Thrive
　　This newspaper reports: The Magakeng Production Team and Houkeng Production Team of Jinxian Commune in Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, have persisted in a socialist competition of mutual encouragement for two years, transforming natural conditions and turning a pair of poor mountain ravines into prosperous teams with sufficient grain and thriving pigs and sheep.
　　Under the guidance of striving for the upper reaches, these two production teams, since starting the linked competition in March 1958, have consistently adhered to the spirit of "learning, helping, and catching up," firmly grasping the key to production in each period, and striving for high yields and first place through mutual encouragement. Both the Magakeng Production Team and the Houkeng Production Team are located in mountainous areas over 1,200 meters above sea level, cultivating terraced fields and sloping land with shallow topsoil and insufficient sunlight, resulting in very poor natural conditions. Therefore, after the start of the competition, they first tackled the problem of the soil. The Magakeng Production Team organized eighteen commune members to deep-plow for a month, turning over eight mu of land to a depth of more than 1.5 chi. The Houkeng Production Team learned from their example and organized thirty-three laborers to work hard for sixteen days, deep-plowing eighteen mu of land. After the Magakeng Production Team learned of this news, they mobilized even more commune members to rush to plow the land. As a result, all the land of both teams was deep-plowed to a depth of more than one chi. Some plots of land had soil that was too thin to be deep-plowed. With soaring enthusiasm and a tenacious spirit, the commune members of the Magakeng Production Team added more than 2,000 dan of transported soil per mu on thirty mu of land. The Houkeng Production Team quickly caught up, immediately organizing commune members to dig turf mud, and quickly added more than 1,000 dan of transported soil per mu to twenty-two mu of land with shallow topsoil. At the same time, they launched twenty-one fertilizer accumulation competitions according to different production seasons. The Magakeng Production Team not only dug out all the bottom mud of the fields, the bottom mud of the manure tanks, and the mud from the pig and sheep pens, but even swept the dust from the chimneys and the eaves of the tiles. Last year, the entire team accumulated more than 28,000 dan of standard fertilizers such as pen manure, leaf fertilizer, burnt mud ash, and human waste, averaging 715 dan of fertilizer per mu. The Houkeng Production Team did not show any weakness and also accumulated 714 dan of fertilizer per mu. They applied these fertilizers in layers and in stages, raising all the cultivated land by three or four cun, providing sufficient base fertilizer and improving the soil. After deep plowing, adding soil, and increasing fertilizer, their fields now have thick, loose, and fertile soil, and they no longer have to rely on shallow planting and meager harvests.
　　Linking each step tightly, learning from the advanced, and opposing conservatism are the characteristics of their competition. After thickening the soil layer and improving the soil, they immediately changed from sparse planting to rational close planting; they broke the superstition that double-cropping rice could not be planted in mountainous areas, changed from single cropping to double cropping, and greatly improved land utilization. Competing for time and comparing speed are the basic requirements of their competition. The Magakeng Production Team broke the convention that sweet potato vines could only be cut and planted when they were six cun long and planted the vines early. The Houkeng Production Team immediately mobilized its members to work hard overnight and planted five mu. After the Magakeng Production Team learned that the Houkeng Production Team had caught up with them, they whipped their horses and, before the "Summer Solstice," planted more than 12,000 jin of sweet potato vines. However, the commune members of the Houkeng Production Team had even more enthusiasm, braving the heavy rain and working day and night to catch up, and finally planted more than 14,000 jin of sweet potato vines five days earlier than the Magakeng team. In the competition, they were very concerned about each other's progress, learned from each other's advantages, and pointed out each other's shortcomings, achieving mutual help and common improvement.
　　These two production teams, after two years of competition, have undergone tremendous changes in production. In 1958, the Houkeng Production Team's average grain yield per mu was 1,375 jin, and the total output reached 118,250 jin, more than doubling from 1957; the average grain per person jumped from 640 jin in 1957 to 876 jin, thus changing from a grain-deficient team to a grain-surplus team. In addition to reserving enough rations and seeds, the entire team also left more than 200 jin of feed for each pig, and also sold 30,000 jin of grain to the state and the higher-level accounting units. In 1958, the Magakeng team had an average of 967 jin of grain per person, an increase of 38% compared to 1957; in addition to selling to the state and the higher-level accounting units, they also had more than 6,600 jin of grain reserves. The spring flowers and early rice of these two production teams have also achieved bumper harvests this year. The spring flower yield per mu of Magakeng was 455 jin, and the spring flower yield per mu of Houkeng reached 532 jin, both of which increased by more than 30% compared to last year, exceeding the original plan. The average yield of early rice per mu of the Houkeng team was 753 jin, which is a red flag for large-scale bumper harvests of early rice in mountainous areas.
　　While developing agricultural production, they resolutely implemented the policy of public and private raising, and vigorously developed poultry and livestock. This year, the Magakeng Production Team has an average of 21.9 pigs and sheep and 32.9 poultry per household, making it the production team with the most livestock and poultry in the county. The Houkeng Production Team also has an average of 38 livestock and poultry per household.
　　Due to the rapid development of production, the lives of the commune members have greatly improved. Now, not only can every family eat their fill and dress warmly, and every household has cured meat and lard, but also many people have bought many daily necessities such as clocks, woolen sweaters, pens, cotton quilts, and rubber shoes. The commune members sing a ballad from the bottom of their hearts: "Since the Communist Party came, the five grains are abundant and the granaries are full, the six domestic animals are in groups and the mountains are full, and poor villages have become happy villages." Praising the leadership of the Party and the happy life.
　　Why has the linked competition between Magakeng and Houkeng achieved such great achievements? To sum up, there are the following reasons:
　　First, it has received the attention and support of Party committees at all levels. The county Party committee and the commune Party committee have repeatedly helped them summarize their experiences, improve their work, and hold on-site meetings to promote their experiences.
　　Second, the guiding ideology of the competition is correct. They have firmly established the idea of striving for the upper reaches and rapidly changing the poor situation. In the competition, they adhered to the socialist competition principle of "learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths, and making up for each other's weaknesses, and improving together."
　　Third, organizing visits and regular evaluations are important methods for them to promote the competition to a higher level. They insisted on visiting each other once every seven days and evaluating once every half a month, constantly moving forward.
　　Furthermore, for more than a year, the Jinyun County Party Committee has carried out the competition campaign of "learning from 'Shuangkeng' and surpassing 'Shuangkeng' (Magakeng and Houkeng)" in the county's rural areas.
　　All six communes, thirty-eight large teams, more than four hundred production teams, and more than one thousand eight hundred production teams in the county have all been linked up to carry out a competition of mutual encouragement. Advanced figures and advanced units have emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,140 advanced pacesetters have been established in the county; twenty-six production teams have caught up with "Shuangkeng" in various tasks, and one hundred and eighteen production teams have caught up with or surpassed "Shuangkeng" in single items such as spring flowers, early rice, and animal husbandry.

    鼓干劲　争上游　改造山区
    马加坑  后坑五谷丰登　牛羊成群
    本报讯　浙江省缙云县缙仙公社马加坑生产队和后坑生产队，坚持了两年你追我赶的社会主义竞赛，改造了自然条件，一对穷山坑变成为粮食充足、猪羊成群的富裕队。
    这两个生产队在力争上游的思想指导下，从1958年3月挂钩竞赛起，一直本着“学、帮、赶”的精神，紧紧抓住了各个时期的生产关键，你追我赶的争高产、夺第一。马加坑生产队和后坑生产队都处在海拔一千二百米以上的山区，种的都是土层浅薄、阳光不足的梯田、斜地，自然条件很差。因此，他们竞赛开始后，首先就攻土壤这一关。马加坑生产队组织了十八个社员深翻一个月，翻了八亩地，深度达一点五尺多。后坑生产队学习他们的样子，组织了三十三个劳动力，苦战了十六天，深翻了十八亩地。马加坑生产队得到这个消息后，又动员更多的社员突击翻地。结果，两队全部土地深翻了一尺以上。有些地块土层太薄，深翻不下去，马加坑生产队的社员以冲天的干劲，顽强的精神，在三十亩地上每亩加客土二千多担。后坑生产队急起直追，马上组织社员去挖草皮泥，很快把二十二亩土层浅薄的地田每亩加上了一千多担客土。在此同时，他们根据不同的生产季节，开展了二十一次积肥竞赛。马加坑不仅挖光了地脚泥、粪缸底泥、猪羊栏泥，就连烟囱、瓦檐上的灰尘也刷得一干二净，全队去年积栏肥、树叶肥、焦泥灰、人粪等标准肥二万八千多担，平均每亩施肥七百一十五担；后坑生产队毫不示弱，每亩也积足了七百一十四担肥。他们把这些肥分层分次的施上，所有耕地足足增高了三、四寸，既施足了基肥，又改良了土壤。通过深翻、加土、增肥后，现在他们的田地都是土厚、土松、土肥了，从此再不浅种薄收了。
    环环扣紧，学先进，反保守是他们竞赛的特色。在加厚土层改良土壤后，他们紧接着就把大株稀植改为合理密植；打破了山区不能种双季稻的迷信，把单熟改为两熟，大大提高了土地利用率。争时间、比速度，是他们竞赛的基本要求。马加坑生产队打破了甘薯种藤六寸长才能剪插的常规，提早插藤后，后坑生产队立即发动社员苦战了一夜种上了五亩。马加坑生产队知道后坑生产队已赶上了他们，快马加鞭，在“夏至”前就插下了甘薯藤一万二千多斤。可是后坑生产队社员的干劲更足，冒着大雨不分昼夜的赶，终于比马加坑提前五天插好了一万四千多斤甘薯藤。在竞赛中，他们非常关心对方的进步，见到对方优点就学，见到缺点就提，达到互相帮助，共同提高的目的。
    这两个生产队，经过两年的竞赛，在生产上发生了巨大的变化。1958年后坑生产队粮食平均亩产一千三百七十五斤，总产量达到十一万八千二百五十斤，比1957年增加了一倍多；每人平均粮食由1957年的六百四十斤跃到八百七十六斤，因此由缺粮队变为余粮队。全队除留足了口粮、种子，又给每头猪留下了二百多斤饲料，而且还有三万斤粮食卖给国家和上调核算单位。马加坑队1958年每人平均有粮食九百六十七斤，比1957年增加了38％；除了卖给国家和上调核算单位外，还有储备粮六千六百多斤。这两个生产队今年的春花、早稻又获得了大丰收。马加坑的春花亩产四百五十五斤，后坑队春花亩产达五百三十二斤，都比去年增长了三成以上，超过了原计划。后坑队的早稻平均亩产七百五十三斤，是山区早稻大面积丰产的红旗。
    在发展农业生产的同时，他们坚决执行公养和私养的方针，大力发展家禽家畜。今年马加坑生产队平均每户已养猪、羊二十一点九头，家禽三十二点九只，是目前全县家畜家禽最多的一个生产队。后坑生产队平均每户也有家畜家禽三十八只。
    由于生产飞速的发展，社员的生活大大的改善。现在不仅家家吃得饱、穿得暖，户户有腌肉、猪油，而且许多人买了钟表、毛线衣、钢笔、棉被、胶鞋等许多生活用品。社员们从心坎里唱出这样一首歌谣：“自从来了共产党，五谷丰登粮满仓，六畜成群满山岗，穷村变成幸福庄。”歌颂党的领导和美满的生活。
    马加坑和后坑的挂钩竞赛为什么能取得这样巨大的成就呢？概括起来有以下几方面原因：
    一、得到各级党委的重视和支持。县委和公社党委多次帮助他们总结经验，提高工作，并召开现场会议推广他们的经验。
    二、竞赛的指导思想正确。他们牢固地树立了力争上游，迅速改变穷困面貌的思想。在竞赛中坚持了“互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高”的社会主义竞赛原则。
    三、组织参观、定期评比，是他们促进竞赛一浪高一浪的重要方法。他们坚持七天相互参观一次，半月评比一次，你追我赶不断前进。
    又讯　一年多来，缙云县委在全县农村开展了“学‘双坑’、超‘双坑’（马加坑和后坑）”的竞赛运动。
    全县六个公社、三十八个大队、四百多个生产队和一千八百多个生产小队全部挂起钩来，开展了你追我赶的竞赛。先进人物和先进单位如雨后春笋般的涌现出来。据不完全统计，全县已树立了一千一百四十多个先进标兵；有二十六个生产队在各种工作上赶上了“双坑”，有一百一十八个生产队在春花、早稻、畜牧业等方面单项赶上或超过了“双坑”。
