Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th: More than twenty basic construction projects newly built and expanded in Guangdong Province to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China have been basically completed recently.

Among these more than twenty basic construction projects, those belonging to industrial production include the Guangzhou Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, the Guangzhou Xicun Foundry, the Guangzhou Hardened Oil Factory, the Guangzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, the Guangzhou Thermos Factory, and the 76 Seamless Steel Pipe Workshop of the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant; those belonging to civilian use include the China Export Commodities Exhibition Hall, the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Exhibition Hall, and the Guangdong Provincial Television Station. The China Export Commodities Exhibition Hall, with a construction area of 36,000 square meters and a height of 49.2 meters, has had eight of its ten floors completed and handed over for use. All six pavilions of the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Exhibition Hall, including agriculture, aquatic products, meteorology, agricultural tools, animal husbandry, etc., have been completed and have begun to arrange exhibits.

Most of these newly built or expanded factories and workshops are not only unprecedented in the history of Guangdong Province, but also industries that are still "missing links" to this day, such as the Guangzhou Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory. To this day, the amount of measuring tools and cutting tools needed in the province still relies on supply from other places. After the completion of the new measuring tool and cutting tool factory, it will be able to produce 10 million pieces of measuring tools and cutting tools every year, which can not only meet the needs of the province, but also supply the provinces of South China.

In order to ensure that all these basic construction projects are completed before the end of this month to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the construction and installation workers on each construction site are doing everything possible to speed up the construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 26th: By the first half of September, Chongqing City had put 315 basic construction projects into production this year. In addition, there are another 259 projects that have entered the completion stage, and construction is proceeding day and night in order to put them into production before National Day.

This year, the scale of basic construction in Chongqing City is larger than in previous years. The basic construction investment in the iron and steel industry is equivalent to 207.3% of the total investment from 1950 to 1957, and the investment in the coal industry is equivalent to 105.3% of the total investment in eight years. The investment in the power industry is also very large. In terms of iron and steel, the first and second phases of the Liujiaba Converter Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have been put into production in September; other factories have also put a number of converters into production. By the end of the month, the city will have added 416,000 tons of steelmaking capacity. In terms of coal and electricity, the commissioning of modern mines such as the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine South Mine and the Yutianbao Coal Mine No. 1 Mine has added 1.5 million tons of coking coal production capacity to the city; the expansion project of the Chongqing Power Plant and the Longxi River Xiaotong Hydropower Station have been delivered for production. In addition, with the new generating units of the Chongqing Power Plant and some small power generating equipment of other factories that will soon be put into production, the city's new generating capacity will reach more than 60,000 kilowatts before the end of September.

This year, according to the Party's General Line and the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee's instruction of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end," the staff of Chongqing's basic construction departments have given full play to their soaring enthusiasm and wisdom, enabling a large number of projects to proceed quickly, with good quality, and saving investment. In the construction process of the fully mechanized Yutianbao No. 1 Mine, the miners fought tenaciously with gas and water inrush, and successively put forward more than 20,000 technical innovation suggestions, and popularized 23 major advanced experiences, so that the entire mine was completed three months ahead of schedule and saved 20% of the investment for the state.

    进度快　质量好　投资省
    广东、重庆大批基本建设工程竣工
    据新华社广州27日电　广东省为迎接建国十周年而新建和扩建的二十多个基本建设项目，已在最近陆续基本完工。
    在这二十多个基本建设项目中，属于工业生产的有广州量具刃具厂，广州西村铸造厂，广州硬化油厂，广州第二棉纺厂，广州热水瓶厂，广州钢铁厂的七十六无缝钢管车间等；属于民用的有中国出口商品陈列馆，广东省农业展览馆，广东省电视台等。建筑面积达三万六千平方米、高四十九点二米的中国出口商品陈列馆，十层大楼已有八层全部建成移交使用。广东省农业展览馆的农业、水产、气象、农具、畜牧等六个馆已全部建成，并且开始布置展品。
    这批新建或扩建的工厂和车间，不仅大部分是广东省历史上从来不曾有过的，而且直到现在还是“缺门”的行业，例如广州量具刃具厂。直到今天，全省所需的量具刃具，仍然依靠外地供应。新建的量具刃具厂建成以后，每年能生产量具刃具一千万件，除了满足本省的需要以外，还可以供应华南各省。
    为了确保这批基本建设工程在本月底以前全部建成，向建国十周年献礼，各个工地上的建筑安装工人，正千方百计加快施工速度。
    据新华社重庆26日电　到9月上半月，重庆市今年已有三百一十五项基本建设工程投入生产。另外还有二百五十九项已经进入竣工阶段的工程，也正在日夜紧张施工，争取在国庆节前投入生产。
    今年重庆市的基本建设规模比历年都大。钢铁工业基本建设投资相当于1950年到1957年投资总和的207.3％，煤炭工业投资相当于八年投资总和的105.3％，电力工业的投资也很大。钢铁方面，重庆钢铁公司刘家坝转炉厂第一和第二两期工程已在9月先后投入生产；其他工厂也有一批转炉投入生产。到月底，全市将新增炼钢设备能力四十一万六千吨。在煤、电方面，中梁山煤矿南矿井、鱼田堡煤矿一号井等现代化矿井的投入生产，使全市新增加了一百五十万吨煤焦的生产能力；重庆发电厂扩建工程、龙溪河下硐水电站等工程都已交付生产，加上最近即将投入生产的重庆发电厂新建发电机组和其他工厂一些小型发电设备，9月底以前全市新增发电能力将达到六万瓩以上。
    今年来，重庆市基本建设部门职工根据党的总路线和中共四川省委“一开头就抓紧、自始至终都抓紧”的指示，发挥了冲天干劲和智慧，使大批工程进展快，质量好，投资省。全部机械化的鱼田堡一号井在建设过程中，矿工们与瓦斯、涌水顽强搏斗，先后提出两万多件技术革新建议，推广二十三项重大先进经验，使整个矿井比原计划提前三个月建成，并为国家节约了20％的投资。
