Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd. The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Akahata," published an editorial today, welcoming and supporting the joint communique of Premier Zhou and Shibashi.

The editorial pointed out that the greatest significance of this joint communique lies in the fact that a veteran of the Liberal Democratic Party publicly expressed an attitude that is opposed to the Kishida Cabinet's so-called "wait and see" approach and the "separation of politics and economics" towards China. At the same time, the spirit of the joint communique is basically consistent with the wishes of the Japanese people who yearn to restore diplomatic relations with China and are waging struggles for this purpose. Therefore, this joint communique has dealt a heavy blow to the Kishida Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party.

"Akahata" pointed out that for more than a year, the relations between Japan and China have continued in a completely abnormal state, contrary to the wishes of the people of both countries. The responsibility for this lies entirely with the Kishida Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party. The reason why Japan-China relations have fallen into today's unfortunate state is because the Kishida Cabinet is following the United States, blatantly hostile to China, and conspiring to create "two Chinas," attempting to forcibly revise the "Security Treaty."

The editorial pointed out that the Kishida Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party have been trying to reverse right and wrong, attempting to shift the responsibility for the deadlock in Japan-China relations onto China. To this end, they have also carried out ridiculous propaganda, but this time the joint communique of Premier Zhou and Shibashi clearly shows that their lying attitude can no longer deceive even knowledgeable members of the Liberal Democratic Party and their supporters.

The editorial criticized the Kishida Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party for not wanting to change their policy towards China even at this stage. The editorial also condemned Kono Yohei, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Foreign Affairs Research Council, for openly claiming that "the government and the Liberal Democratic Party will not change their original policy because of the joint communique of Shibashi and Premier Zhou," attempting to erase the significance of the communique.

"Akahata" emphasized that restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China is the common wish of the Japanese people. The normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and close economic and cultural exchanges are not only beneficial to the people of both countries, but also necessary conditions for maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East. "Akahata" pointed out that, therefore, for the Japanese Communist Party and democratic forces, the most important thing at present is to combine the issue of restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China with the issue of opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty" to launch a struggle, and in the struggle, thoroughly expose the relationship between revising the "Security Treaty" and the policy of hostility towards China, as well as the Kishida Cabinet's policy of following the United States and the aggressive policy of American imperialism, and strengthen the united action to win friendship between the people of Japan and China.

The Japan-China Trade Promotion Association unanimously passed a resolution today supporting the joint communique of Premier Zhou and Tanzan Shibashi. The resolution stated, "The communique has great positive significance for resolving the current relationship between Japan and China." The resolution stated, "As stated in the communique, the people of Japan and China should join hands to contribute to peace in the Far East and the world. This is an unwavering guideline for opening up Japan-China relations and therefore receives our full support."

The resolution expressed agreement with all other points mentioned in the communique, and finally stated, "We guarantee to do our best to implement the spirit of the communique in actual politics and economics."

    日共“赤旗报”发表社论
    支持周总理石桥会谈公报
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，表示欢迎和支持周总理和石桥的会谈公报。
    社论指出，这次会谈公报最大的意义在于自由民主党元老公开表明了与岸信介内阁对中国采取的所谓“静观”和“政治与经济分开”相对立的态度。同时，会谈公报的精神在基本上同渴望恢复同中国的邦交，并为此正在展开斗争的日本人民的愿望是一致的。因此，这项会谈公报对岸信介内阁和自由民主党给予了沉重的打击。
    “赤旗报”指出，一年多以来日中两国间的关系正与两国人民的愿望相反，仍然继续着完全不正常的状态，这个责任完全在于岸信介内阁和自由民主党。日中关系所以陷入今天的不幸状态是因为岸信介内阁追随美国，露骨地敌视中国和阴谋制造“两个中国”，企图强行修改“安全条约”。
    社论指出，岸信介内阁和自由民主党一直颠倒是非想把日中关系陷入僵局的责任推到中国身上，为此还进行了谎谬的宣传，但是这次周总理和石桥的会谈公报清楚表明，它们这种撒谎的态度已经连有见识的自由民主党员和它们的支持者都骗不过去了。
    社论指责岸信介内阁和自由民主党到了今天这种地步还不想改变对中国的政策。社论并且谴责自由民主党外交调查会会长贺屋兴宣公然声称“政府和自由民主党并不由于石桥和周总理会谈公报而改变原来的方针”，企图抹煞公报的意义。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，恢复日中邦交是日本人民的共同愿望，日中两国邦交的正常化和经济、文化的密切交流，不仅对于两国人民有益，而且是维护和巩固远东和平所必需的条件。“赤旗报”指出，因此，对于日本共产党和民主力量来说，目前最重要的是把恢复日中邦交问题和反对修改“安全条约”问题结合起来展开斗争，并且在斗争中彻底地揭穿修改“安全条约”与敌视中国政策的关系和岸信介内阁追随美国的政策以及美帝国主义的侵略政策，加强为争取日中两国人民友好的统一行动。
    日中贸易促进协会今天一致通过决议，支持周总理和石桥湛山的会谈公报。决议说：“公报对解决目前日中两国关系具有重大的积极意义。”决议说，“正如公报中所说的，日中两国人民应该携起手来，为远东和世界和平作出贡献。这是打开日中关系的坚定不移的方针，因此得到我们的全力支持。”
    决议表示同意公报中所提的其它各点，最后说：“我们保证尽力把公报的精神贯彻到实际政治和经济中去。”
