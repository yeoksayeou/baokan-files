At a time when the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of the capital are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and are launching a new high tide of the production and economy movement across all fronts, the second session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress is convening. This is of great significance.

The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on launching the production and economy movement points out: "At present, the central task of the entire Party and all the people of all nationalities across the country is to deeply develop a vigorous production and economy movement, and to struggle to complete and overfulfill the 1959 production and construction plans. Especially in the next month or so, we must seize the opportunity to launch a new production high tide, so that industry, agriculture, and transportation can achieve decisive victories in the third quarter, and use this victory to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China."

To complete this glorious task, the people of Beijing, like the people of the entire country, on the basis of the great leap forward of 1958, have rolled up their sleeves and launched a red-hot continuing leap forward movement across all fronts, continuously achieving new victories. In the industrial sector, in August, the workers of the entire city completed the monthly production value plan with an excess of 15.2%, and the average daily production value reached 27 million yuan, creating the highest record of average daily production value so far this year. The situation in the first five days of September was even better, with the total industrial production value of the entire city increasing by about 38% compared to the first five days of August. The production of major products also increased significantly: for example, pig iron increased by 8%, steel increased by 87%, steel products increased by 42%, and coal increased by 16%. In the agricultural sector, despite suffering severe waterlogging disasters, the suburbs planted 550,000 mu of autumn vegetables, exceeding the original plan of 418,000 mu by 32%. The Miyun Reservoir, with a capacity of 410 million cubic meters, started construction in the autumn of last year and has already intercepted floods during this year's flood season, playing a huge role in flood control, saving tens of counties downstream of the Chaobai River from flood disasters. In terms of basic construction projects, all workers have worked together to rush the completion of unfinished projects, with 760,000 square meters of construction completed in just 20 days. Everyone can see that the buildings of the National People's Congress, the Chinese Revolution Museum, the Chinese History Museum, the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum, the Nationalities Culture Palace, Beijing Railway Station, and the Workers' Stadium, among others, have been completed in less than a year.

Our continuous leaps forward in various aspects of socialist construction fully prove the correctness of the general line of building socialism with great, swift, and sound progress. It has powerfully refuted the slander and defamation of all domestic and foreign hostile elements against our socialist construction general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes. The great achievements of our socialist revolution and construction will not be diminished by any slander and defamation; on the contrary, the more domestic and foreign hostile elements attack our general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes, the more it proves that we are completely correct. We must raise high the banners of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes, and march forward bravely.

Why can we make such high-speed leaps forward? This is because the national economy left behind by the old society was extremely backward, making us in a state of both poverty and ignorance. However, the people of our country are not content with being backward; they want to quickly get rid of the state of both poverty and ignorance. Therefore, after the country's liberation, when the people took control of their own destiny, they demanded large-scale, high-speed socialist revolution and construction. We can make such high-speed leaps forward because we have the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core. The Party has formulated the correct lines, principles, and policies for revolution and construction in each period, closely linked with the masses, and embodied the wishes and demands of the people, leading the people from one victory to another. The achievements of Beijing over the past decade vividly prove this point.

Over the past decade, with an unremitting revolutionary spirit, we have not only thoroughly completed all democratic reforms but also achieved decisive victories in the socialist revolution, launching large-scale socialist construction work. This has made our capital's appearance change greatly along with the rapid development of our great motherland.

Before liberation, Beijing was a backward consumption city, with almost no modern industry. In 1949, the total industrial and handicraft production value of the entire city was only 170 million yuan, and there were only about 70,000 industrial workers. By 1958, our industrial and handicraft production value had grown to 4.6 billion yuan, an increase of 26 times compared to 1949. The number of industrial workers reached 870,000, an increase of more than 11 times compared to 1949. In 1949, most of Beijing's industries were small and dilapidated factories; now, we already have 97 factories with more than 1,000 but fewer than 5,000 workers, and 13 factories with more than 5,000 workers. In 1958 alone, the production value increased by 2.5 billion yuan, exceeding the total increase in production value over the previous nine years. This fully proves that we have been continuously leaping forward over the past decade, and last year was an unprecedented year of great leap forward.

In the early days of liberation, the farmers in the suburbs were still scattered individual households, and feudal land relations shackled the development of agricultural productivity. At that time, there was not a single tractor, and there were almost no power-driven irrigation machines. Only 2.8% of the arable land could be irrigated; now, the rural areas of the suburbs have completely achieved communalization. By the end of 1958, we already had 490 tractors and more than 89,000 horsepower of various irrigation machines, and the arable land that could be irrigated accounted for one-third of the total arable land. In 1958, the grain yield per mu reached 318 jin, an increase of 47% compared to 216 jin in 1957. Such a large increase in one year, is this not an unprecedented great leap forward?

Over the past decade, the newly constructed building area has reached 2,724 million square meters, which is 1.3 times the total original building area of Beijing City. When Beijing was just liberated, the entire city had only 280 kilometers of sewers, most of which were silted up and unusable, with only 20 kilometers that could be used. After ten years of construction, in addition to completely dredging the silted-up sewers, we have also built 561 kilometers of new sewers, with diameters and engineering quality far superior to the old sewers. The paved roads, which had only 2.19 million square meters before liberation, have now reached 10.81 million square meters, and we have roads as wide as Chang'an Street. At the time of liberation, the entire city had only 5 public buses and 49 trolleybuses, but now public transportation vehicles have reached 1,136.

With the development of production and the reconstruction of the city, people's material and cultural lives have significantly improved. The number of employed people in the entire city has increased from 430,000 in 1949 to 1.62 million in 1958. In addition to the significant increase in social labor insurance and welfare, from 1949 to 1958, the average wage of industrial workers increased by more than 70%; the average income of each agricultural laborer, according to statistics from the suburban areas, also increased by more than two times.

At the time of liberation, the city had only 110,000 primary school students and 40,000 middle school students. At that time, about half of the school-age children could not attend primary school, and even fewer could attend middle school and university. If calculated according to the current district divisions, at the time of liberation, there were 320,000 primary school students, 43,000 middle school and normal school students, and 14,000 university students; now, there are 916,000 primary school students, 267,000 middle school and normal school students, and 110,000 university students. This means that the number of primary school students has nearly doubled, the number of middle school and normal school students has increased by five times, and the number of university students has nearly increased by seven times. At the time of liberation, Beijing had very few large hospitals, with only about 4,000 doctors and other medical personnel in the entire city, and only 3,000 hospital beds; by the end of 1958, the number of doctors and other medical personnel had increased to nearly 30,000, and the number of hospital beds had increased to more than 21,000, an increase of more than six times.

These facts fully prove that our achievements over the past decade have been enormous! These facts indisputably prove the great superiority of the socialist system. Especially in 1958, under the guidance of the general line of building socialism with great, swift, and sound progress, the entire city's people were full of vigor, liberated their minds, worked hard, and worked smartly, launching a vigorous mass movement across all fronts, achieving an unprecedented, comprehensive great leap forward, accelerating the speed of national economic development, and fully demonstrating the power of the general line.

Over the past decade, especially since last year's great leap forward, we have accumulated rich experience. Summarizing this experience, on the basis of the great victories already achieved, responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, we must raise high the victorious banner of the general line of building socialism with great, swift, and sound progress, and continue to leap forward. This is our glorious task for the future. Now, I will report on the work of several major aspects on behalf of the Municipal People's Committee.

(1) Regarding Industrial Production and Basic Construction

The situation of industrial production in Beijing has always been good. Currently, the new high tide of the production and economy movement is fully unfolding in the industrial sector, and industrial production value is increasing day by day. In August, the total industrial production value completed 530 million yuan, exceeding the monthly plan by 15.2%, and increasing by 19% compared to July. Among them, steel production increased by 12.7%, steel products increased by 17%, pig iron increased by 2.7%, and major products such as cement, electricity, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, and woolen textiles all exceeded the plan. Many daily light industrial products are also increasing rapidly. How was this new achievement made? This is the result of continuing to leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward of 1958. If it were not for the great leap forward, we simply could not imagine how we could achieve such results.

Last year, the total industrial production value of the entire city completed 4.6 billion yuan, an increase of 1.15 times compared to 1957, and an increase of 26 times compared to 1.7 billion yuan in 1949. And this year, from January to August, we have already completed 4.3 billion yuan, an increase of more than one time compared to the same period last year. Domestic and foreign hostile elements slander our great leap forward as a "great retreat," and they wouldn't even dare to dream that there could be such a great leap forward in the world. This is only because they have short-sighted vision and malicious intentions. As for the facts of our great leap forward, they will not be erased by this.

To illustrate the great leap forward in industrial production in 1958 and the continuing leap forward this year, let's take a look at the development of several major products.

First, steel: In 1949, Beijing had no steel smelting enterprises; in 1957, at the end of the First Five-Year Plan, the annual steel production was only 28,000 tons; but in 1958, the annual production reached 160,000 tons (including 120,000 tons of "foreign steel"). From January to August this year, we have already completed 206,000 tons of "foreign steel."

Second, steel products: In 1949, we could not produce a single ton of steel products; by 1957, we only produced 14,000 tons; in 1958, we leaped to an annual production of 58,400 tons. From January to August this year, we have already completed 118,000 tons.

Third, pig iron: In 1949, the annual production was only 26,000 tons; in 1957, it had increased to an annual production of 430,000 tons; in 1958, it further increased to an annual production of 520,000 tons, nearly 19 times the 1949 production. From January to August this year, we have already completed 454,000 tons.

The rapid development of the steel industry fully proves that the mass movement of steel smelting in 1958 was full of vitality and achieved great results. Domestic and foreign hostile elements slander that our steel smelting has "failed," and right-opportunist elements also say that the large-scale steel production is "not worth the effort." In the face of these facts, these arguments have already collapsed.

Fourth, raw coal: In 1949, the annual production was 1.11 million tons, and production was extremely backward at the time, relying entirely on manual mining, with no modern equipment. Moreover, once the rainy season came, the mines were often flooded and had to stop production; after several years of improvement, modern equipment was added. In 1957, it increased to 2.57 million tons; in 1958, it increased to 4.6 million tons, more than three times the 1949 production. Moreover, the level of equipment and technology in coal mining has also improved significantly. Now, there are 26 modern mines in the entire city, and the production process has basically been mechanized or semi-mechanized. From January to August this year, we have already completed 409 million tons, an increase of 68.5% compared to the same period last year.

Fifth, electricity: In 1949, the entire city's electricity production was 150 million kWh; in 1957, it was 700 million kWh; in 1958, it reached 1.05 billion kWh, more than six times the 1949 production. From January to August this year, we have already completed 1.16 billion kWh, exceeding the total electricity production of last year.

Sixth, metal cutting machine tools: In 1949, Beijing had no machine tool manufacturing industry; in 1957, the annual production was 1,900 units; in 1958, the annual production increased to 4,770 units, an increase of 1.5 times compared to 1957, and the variety of machine tools also increased from two to more than 50. From January to August this year, we have already completed more than 2,700 units, an increase of 7.8% compared to the same period last year.

Seventh, power machinery: In the early days of liberation, Beijing could not produce any power machinery; in 1957, the entire year only produced 500 horsepower of power machinery; in 1958, it increased to 38,000 horsepower. From January to August this year, we have already completed 24,600 horsepower, an increase of one time compared to the same period last year.

Eighth, electronics and radio industry: In the early days of liberation, we had a blank in the electronics and radio industry. After the construction of the First Five-Year Plan, we have established factories with the latest technology and equipment for electronics, radio, and electrical communication materials, laying a good foundation for this industry. In 1958, the product output had a great leap forward, and the output of electronic tubes alone increased by about two times compared to 1957. This year, it is estimated that it can increase by about one time compared to last year.

Ninth, cotton yarn: In 1949, Beijing had no modern cotton spinning industry; during the First Five-Year Plan period, we successively built several large-scale spinning mills, and the total number of spindles in the entire city reached 240,000. In 1957, the annual cotton yarn production was 1.09 million piculs; in 1958, it increased to 1.8 million piculs, an increase of 65% in one year. From January to August this year, we have already completed 1.5 million piculs, an increase of 48.8% compared to the same period last year.

Comrades, the above-mentioned important industrial products were mostly not produced in Beijing at all in the early days of liberation. Over the past decade, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, through the efforts of the people of the entire city, with the support of people from all over the country, and with the help of experts from the Soviet Union and other brother countries, as well as learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we have not only gone from nothing to something but also, through the construction of the First Five-Year Plan period and 1958, made these industries achieve leaps and bounds in development. Especially for many products, the increase in 1958 alone was more than the increase over the five years of the First Five-Year Plan period. If it were not for the great leap forward of 1958, how could we imagine achieving such great results?

In 1958, significant achievements were also made in reducing costs and improving production efficiency. Compared to 1957, the average cost of comparable products was reduced by 14.4%; the labor productivity of the entire industry increased by an average of 70%; especially in 1958, thousands of new products were added, and the quality of some products was also improved. This shows that our industrial technology level has significantly improved.

Since this year, we have continuously opposed the rightist slackening tendency, and especially since July, the ideological work to oppose rightism has become more in-depth. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has increased, and production has risen step by step. Since the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on launching the production and economy movement was announced, this great driving force has further quickly pushed the production and economy movement in our city to a new and greater high tide. Now, we can see that this new high tide has some new characteristics:

First, from the beginning, a wave of mass technological innovation has appeared. For example, the vacuum pump workshop of the Xingping Machinery Factory has almost every process with technological innovations, and the production efficiency of the entire workshop has increased by nearly two times; the Civil Lighting Factory has implemented 91 technological innovations since August 27, and some have increased efficiency by 15 times.

Second, many factories have generally broken through production quotas. For example, the second factory of the North China Radio Materials Factory, after the announcement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in five days, out of 859 workers with production quotas, 741 people broke through the quotas; in the Civil Lighting Factory, 363 out of 425 people broke through the quotas.

Third, a more extensive mass movement of learning from and catching up with advanced workers has emerged, and many workers create new records every day. The Jiang Donglai team of the First Machine Tool Factory used to produce 18 main shafts of lathes per day, but in this movement, on August 26, they produced 28, on the 27th, they produced 32, on the 28th, they produced 34, and on the 29th, they produced 38, creating new records every day. The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, in August, the production value exceeded the plan by 71%, and the scrap rate was reduced by 12% compared to July.

The unprecedented high tide of production is continuing to develop, moving from one victory to another.

In terms of basic construction, because Beijing is our capital, a considerable amount of investment is needed for urban reconstruction and the construction of state organs and cultural and educational undertakings. However, we have continued to increase the proportion of investment in industrial construction, especially in 1958, the investment in industrial basic construction reached 590 million yuan, accounting for nearly half of the total basic construction investment that year, an increase of 2.5 times compared to 1957, equivalent to more than 60% of the total industrial basic construction investment in the First Five-Year Plan period in our city. In 1958, the newly built and expanded projects, by the end of the year, had 133 projects completed or partially completed and put into production, including 32 projects above the quota. After ten years, especially through the construction of the First Five-Year Plan period and 1958, our city has already had a certain scale in steel and iron smelting industry, mechanical and electrical manufacturing industry, electronics and radio industry, chemical industry, building materials industry, cotton and wool textile industry, and other aspects, laying the initial foundation for the industrialization of the capital. However, the goal of a modern industrial city is still far away, and our construction tasks in the future are still very arduous.

We have arranged the basic construction projects for this year according to the spirit of the national chessboard and the principle of concentrating forces to ensure key points. The total basic construction investment in the municipal financial budget is 1.6 billion yuan, with the main part still concentrated in the industrial sector. Among the eight projects above the quota, six are industrial projects, mainly including the Special Steel Plant, Steam Turbine Plant, First Machine Tool Plant, Casting and Forging Plant, Second Chemical Plant, Enamel Plant, etc.; the cultural enterprises include the Beijing Film Studio; the municipal public utilities include new projects for water supply engineering. In addition, there are more than 30 projects invested by the central government, including the Dongjiao Thermal Power Plant and Beijing Bearing Factory. The total basic construction investment by the central and local governments is 12.3 billion yuan.

In 1959, the total industrial production value plan for the entire city is 65 billion yuan, an increase of 41% compared to 1958. According to this plan, steel, steel products, industrial bearings, locomotives, freight cars, and other industrial products will all increase by one to several times; pig iron, electricity, combine harvesters, vegetable oil, and other products will all increase by more than 50%; raw coal, caustic soda, cotton yarn, machine-made paper, and other products will all increase by more than 25%.

According to this year's industrial production plan, the total production value for the year should be 65 billion yuan, which means that in the next few months, the average monthly production value should be more than 6 billion yuan, an increase of 22% compared to the average monthly production value of the previous eight months, and an increase of 15% compared to August. Therefore, our task is still very arduous, and we must roll up our sleeves, seize the current favorable situation, mobilize the masses of workers, further deepen the production and economy movement, improve labor productivity, increase production, improve quality, save raw materials, reduce costs, strengthen enterprise management, strengthen equipment maintenance, ensure safe production, launch a technological revolution, improve labor organization, combine hard work with smart work, and strive to complete and overfulfill the industrial production plan for this year on a monthly and quarterly basis.

(2) Regarding Agricultural Production

1958 was also a year of comprehensive great leap forward in our rural work, which was mainly reflected in the unprecedented bumper harvest of agricultural production, the deep plowing of autumn wheat, the large-scale water conservancy construction, the expansion of agricultural basic construction, the full realization of communalization in the suburbs, the large-scale development of industry by the communes, and the large-scale development of collective welfare undertakings, etc.

Since liberation, our agricultural production level has significantly improved. According to statistics from the suburban areas, in 1958, the cotton yield per mu was 60 jin, and the vegetable yield per mu was 5,168 jin, both of which increased by more than two times compared to 16 jin and 1,600 jin in 1949. In 1958, after verification, the grain yield per mu reached 318 jin, an increase of more than one time compared to 127 jin in 1949. And the increase in 1958 was faster than in previous years, with the grain yield per mu increasing by 47% compared to 216 jin in 1957. This is a special great leap forward.

This year's bumper harvest of wheat is a sign of a new leap forward in suburban agriculture. Various people's communes have fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses, implemented the various production measures stipulated in the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production, and accumulated rich experience. Last autumn, the wheat sowing area was expanded, generally plowed to a depth of about one chi, universally implemented dense planting, applied more base fertilizer, and most of the wheat fields were irrigated. Moreover, the field management of wheat fields was strengthened, so that this year's wheat harvest achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. This year's total wheat production reached 218 million jin, an increase of 35% compared to 161 million jin last year. Large areas of high-yield fields appeared, with more than 12,000 mu of wheat fields yielding more than 500 jin per mu, and more than 30 mu yielding more than 1,000 jin per mu.

To meet the increasing demand for vegetables in the city, we have gradually expanded the planting area of various vegetables year by year. We have vigorously developed the production of summer and autumn vegetables and increased the production of spring vegetables by setting up sunbeds and greenhouses. Compared to the original seven suburban districts, the total vegetable production increased from 107 million jin in 1949 to nearly 1.6 billion jin in 1958, an increase of more than 13 times, and in 1958 alone, it increased by nearly 400 million jin.

The leap forward in the agricultural sector in 1958 was also reflected in the rapid expansion of agricultural accumulation and basic construction. Since the winter of 1957, the movement of large-scale water conservancy construction has begun, and in 1958 alone, 13 projects including the Ming Tombs Reservoir and Huairou Reservoir were completed, and various people's communes also built more than 90 small reservoirs. Together with the excavation of canals and other engineering quantities, it reached 85 million cubic meters of earth and stone. Most of these reservoirs have already shown benefits this year. The actual irrigated area in the entire suburbs increased from 580,000 mu in 1957 to 2.37 million mu. Starting from last autumn, under the direct leadership of the central government, in cooperation with Hebei Province, the construction of the Miyun Reservoir began, with an engineering quantity of 37 million cubic meters of earth and stone. Now, 25 million cubic meters have been completed, and the main dam has reached the flood interception elevation. After completion, the water storage capacity will be equivalent to 60 Ming Tombs Reservoirs. The number of civilian workers participating in the reservoir construction often reaches 200,000. These water conservancy projects have created extremely favorable conditions for future agricultural increases and the prevention of water and drought disasters. The agricultural accumulation in 1958 also increased rapidly. In one year, 162 tractors were added, an increase of 70% compared to 1957; irrigation machinery increased by 23,500 horsepower, an increase of 1.4 times compared to 1957.

After the autumn of 1958, in a very short period of time, the entire suburbs achieved communalization like a surging tide. Immediately, a high tide of deep plowing of land was launched, with 6 million mu of land deep plowed, of which about 4.5 million mu of land were deep plowed to a depth of one chi to one chi and five inches. At the same time, several thousand commune-run factories were established, and the winter sideline production movement was launched, rapidly expanding agricultural accumulation, establishing a large number of canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, liberating a large number of female laborers, and also dispatching 80,000 to 90,000 strong laborers to participate in the construction of the Miyun Reservoir. The facts have proven that the people's communes are obviously more convenient for unified planning, can undertake relatively large production undertakings and basic construction that agricultural production cooperatives cannot undertake, are convenient for the overall planning and distribution of the entire commune, and can reasonably arrange labor and undertake various collective welfare undertakings. Now, the 2.8 million farmers in the suburbs, organized into 76 large-scale people's communes that combine industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military, and integrate politics and communes, have already embarked on a solid and healthy development path after being rectified according to the principles of unified leadership, hierarchical management, hierarchical accounting, and distribution according to work.

Under the unified planning and leadership of various people's communes this year, the suburbs have continued to leap forward in all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. In addition to the bumper harvest of wheat, the spring and summer sowing area of grain crops has been completed, reaching 6.07 million mu, exceeding the plan; the spring and summer sowing of vegetables has been completed, reaching 480,000 mu; the autumn sowing of vegetables has been completed, reaching 550,000 mu, an increase of two and a half times compared to last year. In addition to supplying the market and farmers' own consumption, the current number of chickens raised has reached 4.53 million, an increase of more than 80% compared to the beginning of the year's 2.5 million; the number of pigs raised has reached 1.07 million, an increase of 20% compared to the beginning of the year's 890,000. In addition to the leap forward in production, this year, 128 tractors and more than 20,000 horsepower of irrigation machinery have been added. All of this shows that under the unified planning of the people's communes, the production and basic construction in the rural areas have continued to leap forward. Domestic and foreign hostile elements say that the "people's communes have gone wrong," and that "farmers in the communes have begun to lose interest in increasing production." This is not shameless slander? Especially in this year's anti-flood and disaster relief struggle, the role of the people's communes has become even more prominent. The flood disaster this year, due to the heavy rainfall, is unprecedented in the past few decades, and the time and place of the rainfall are also very concentrated. The cumulative rainfall in July and August reached 1,066 millimeters, which is 400 millimeters more than the annual rainfall in normal years. Although several major rivers did not cause disasters due to our construction of reservoirs, important vegetable-producing areas, grain-producing areas, and important bases for sideline food production have suffered serious internal flooding disasters. The most severely affected area, Daxing District, has 810,000 mu of flooded arable land, accounting for 90% of the total arable land in the district. The entire suburbs have 2.5 million mu of flooded land, accounting for about one-third of the total arable land in the suburbs. In the face of such a serious disaster, the diligent and brave farmers of the suburbs, under the banner of the people's communes, have determined to conquer nature, with sky-high enthusiasm, and launched a tenacious struggle against the flood disaster. They braved the heavy rain, day and night, rushed to repair the dikes, drain the water, rescue the crops, and sow autumn vegetables. In many places, they sowed autumn vegetables in the rain, sowed and were washed away, washed away and sowed again, repeating this process three, four, or even five times. After such a tenacious battle, 2.3 million mu of land have now been drained, and the autumn vegetable sowing plan has been exceeded.

The state-owned farms have developed significantly in 1958, with rapid increases in the production of milk, pigs, chickens, and vegetables. These state-owned farms should focus on the production of sideline food and become an important base for the production of sideline food in our city.

Now, the entire city has several large reservoirs and some artificial lakes, with a total water area of 430,000 mu, which should be well utilized to develop freshwater aquaculture.

The current task of various people's communes in the suburbs is to seize the opportunity, immediately mobilize and organize all forces, and do a good job in production work centered on autumn harvest, wheat sowing, and field management of autumn vegetables, striving for a bumper harvest in autumn and laying the foundation for continuing to leap forward next year. During the autumn harvest, we must harvest one field at a time, and definitely harvest better, faster, and cleaner than last year. At the same time, we must immediately launch a high tide of wheat sowing, fine-tilling, and timely sowing. We strive to expand the autumn sowing of wheat to about 1.5 million mu and launch a large-area high-yield field movement, striving for the unit area yield to greatly exceed this year's wheat harvest. In terms of vegetable production, the main task is to manage the already sown 550,000 mu of autumn vegetables well, prevent and control diseases and pests, strive to exceed the planned production of autumn vegetables, and do a good job in the production of winter greenhouses, sunbeds, and root vegetables. To prevent future drought and flood disasters, in this winter and next spring, we must launch a large-scale water conservancy construction movement, unified planning, unified leadership, and conduct a systematic investigation and research on the characteristics of this year's rainwater accumulation, and comprehensively repair the existing rivers, canals, and culverts, so that they can not only irrigate but also drain. Moreover, we must develop the existing 2.45 million mu of effective irrigated area to about 4 million mu, creating more favorable conditions for the continued leap forward of agriculture next year. To further improve the labor productivity of agricultural production, in addition to continuing to improve the labor organization and tap labor potential, we must strive to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of tillage and irrigation within the next three to five years, strive to improve the means of transportation in rural areas, and strive to produce and supply more chemical fertilizers.

The public canteens and nursery organizations in rural areas must be actively run well, with voluntary participation, and continue to implement the principle of rationing grain according to the number of people, distributing to households, and saving for oneself. We must do everything possible to run the public canteens and nurseries well.

(3) Regarding Urban Construction

Like industry and agriculture, since 1958, there has also been a great leap forward in urban construction, with large-scale urban reconstruction work being carried out, making our capital rapidly advance towards the goal of modernization.

In terms of construction projects, the scale of 1958 and 1959 has exceeded any year since liberation. In 1958, the total completed construction area for the entire year increased from an average of 3 million square meters per year during the First Five-Year Plan period to 4.57 million square meters. By the end of August 1959, the total construction area that had started construction reached 3.37 million square meters, and the total completed construction and installation work volume reached 460 million yuan, an increase of 1.2 times compared to the same period last year.

The main construction projects are the construction and expansion of the Shijingshan Steel Plant, Beijing Steel Plant, Special Steel Plant, Coking Chemical Plant, Steam Turbine Plant, First Machine Tool Plant, Agricultural Machinery Plant, and other factories, and the construction of the National People's Congress building and the Chinese Revolution Museum, Chinese History Museum, Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum, Nationalities Culture Palace, Beijing Railway Station, Workers' Stadium, and other large public buildings. While concentrating our efforts to rush the construction of industrial basic projects and these huge public buildings, we have also built a batch of scientific research institutions, schools of all levels, and residential buildings. From the beginning of 1958 to the end of August this year, the total completed area has reached more than 2.6 million square meters; among them, residential buildings have reached more than 1.8 million square meters.

In addition to the construction of industrial basic projects and these huge public buildings, we have also built a batch of scientific research institutions, schools of all levels, and residential buildings. From the beginning of 1958 to the end of August this year, the total completed area has reached more than 2.6 million square meters; among them, residential buildings have reached more than 1.8 million square meters.

Title: Great Leap Forward in Beijing's Construction Industry
Author:
Date: 1959-09-26
Page: 1

Since the Great Leap Forward, Beijing's construction industry has made significant strides in engineering quality, construction speed, technological level, and management level. Many large-scale projects with high standards of decoration and modern equipment have been completed in less than a year. For example, the current largest modernized Beijing Railway Station, which started construction in January this year, is expected to be handed over for use by mid-month. The grand-scale Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution was completed by the end of July this year. The largest building for the National People's Congress has a floor area of over 170,000 square meters, larger than the entire building area of the Forbidden City, with a complex structure featuring steel beams with spans of over 60 meters, the heaviest weighing 141 tons. The reinforced concrete in this building totals 127,000 cubic meters, with marble, granite, and terrazzo covering 170,000 square meters. It also includes complex ventilation, broadcasting, television, air conditioning, gas, and heating systems. This project, from design to completion, took less than a year. Such large-scale projects completed in such a short time are unprecedented in China's construction history! Those who attack, slander, or doubt our Great Leap Forward should come and see these large-scale buildings for themselves!

In municipal engineering and public utilities, due to the rapid development of industry and the need for capital reconstruction, the total volume of completed projects in 1958 increased by nearly one-fold compared to 1957, and 1959 is expected to increase by nearly 80% compared to 1958. The main municipal engineering projects for 1959 include: the completion of the Tiananmen Square renovation, expanding the square from the original 11 hectares to the current 40 hectares; the completion of the road renovation of East Chang'an Street and the underground pipeline project from Dongdan to Xidan; especially for a modern city, the indispensable heat and gas, after last year's small-scale trial, large-scale construction began this year, with an expected completion of 11 kilometers of heat pipes and 21 kilometers of gas pipes. Since 1958, public transportation has also seen significant development and improvement. To adapt to the city's development, improve public transportation, and reduce urban noise, the tram lines in the inner city have been completely removed, while 142 trolleybuses and 395 buses have been added.

Since 1958, we have been able to achieve such a great leap in urban construction because, under the guidance of the general line, we have implemented the policy of concentrating forces, ensuring key points, and attacking key points in our work. We have combined centralized leadership with mass movements, combined the masses' sky-high enthusiasm with meticulous management work, improved technical and construction management, and most importantly, the broad masses of workers in the urban construction sector have liberated their thinking, mustered sky-high enthusiasm, and combined hard work, practical work, and clever work to engage in selfless labor. This fully demonstrates the self-awareness of the masters. The right-wing opportunists not only close their eyes and fail to see the glorious achievements of the Great Leap Forward but also oppose the general line and fear to mobilize the masses. They label the enthusiastic mass movement as "petty-bourgeois enthusiasm." The facts prove that without the general line and the enthusiastic mass movement, such a great leap forward would be impossible. Isn't this very clear?

Over the past ten years, our urban construction work has made significant progress. Today's situation is fundamentally different from the pre-liberation days of Beijing, where "no wind raises three feet of dust, and rain makes the streets muddy." Over 1.5 million square meters of dilapidated buildings have been demolished, and 27.24 million square meters of new buildings have been constructed. The remnants of the feudal city walls, which hindered modern urban construction, have been partially demolished. However, the current Beijing is still far from being a completely modernized city. Over the past ten years, although we have built over 10 million square meters of housing and many municipal transportation facilities, housing is still insufficient, and public transportation and water supply still cannot meet the rapidly growing needs. These are the difficulties of development. The reconstruction and expansion of the capital is a long-term and arduous task that requires a large amount of manpower, material resources, and investment. Under the current situation where we concentrate our main efforts on developing industry and agriculture and the city's population is rapidly increasing, it is impossible to quickly and fully meet the citizens' demands for housing, public transportation, and other public facilities. These problems can only be gradually solved with the continuous development of production.

In the coming months, in the field of construction engineering, in addition to ensuring the rapid completion and handover of basic construction projects that are about to be completed, we should also focus on important factories, scientific research institutions, schools, and residential buildings. In municipal engineering, we should focus on the expansion of water wells and water pipelines and the laying of coal gas and heat pipes to fully utilize coal gas and heat. In design and construction, we should continue to implement the general line, launch mass movements, and promote technological revolutions to create a new high tide of the Great Leap Forward, improve production efficiency, ensure engineering quality, practice economy, and oppose waste. Design work should seriously implement the principles of practicality, economy, and, where possible, aesthetics. Designers should go to the site, combine theory with practice, investigate and study, summarize experiences, and continuously improve design levels and gradually promote standardized design. In construction, we should further improve construction management, establish various systems, improve labor organization, and strengthen the management and use of construction machinery to improve equipment utilization.

The speed of capital construction will continue to increase. Currently, the mechanization level of our construction and municipal engineering is still low, and manual labor still accounts for a significant proportion. This backward situation is clearly insufficient to meet the needs of rapid urban reconstruction. We must adopt the policy of "walking on two legs," improving labor organization and manual operation methods on one hand, and gradually increasing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of construction with the development of the capital's industry on the other. We should start solving the production of construction machinery and vigorously cultivate technical forces for mechanized construction to improve the technical level of capital construction and municipal enterprises.

In urban planning, we must combine short-term construction with long-term planning, considering both the current level of national production and people's living standards and future development needs. We must comprehensively consider and arrange all aspects of urban construction, such as factories, housing, shops, schools, roads, and water and sewage systems, and strengthen the management of urban planning.

Due to the rapid development of basic construction and industrial and agricultural production, the volume of railway and highway freight transportation has increased significantly this year. In addition to reasonably arranging transportation tasks and improving transportation efficiency, we must fully utilize the potential of all transportation vehicles in the city, organizing vehicles from government agencies, enterprises, and suburbs to participate in transportation. For the difficulties of short-distance transportation and insufficient loading and unloading capacity, we should mobilize the masses, launch technological revolutions, and concentrate forces to solve them. We should also gradually increase the number of motor vehicles to achieve the mechanization or semi-mechanization of transportation and loading and unloading work.

(4) On the issue of market commodity supply

With the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the rapid development of various construction projects, and the rapid increase in urban population, the commodity market in our city has expanded unprecedentedly, and the volume of commodity procurement and sales has increased rapidly. In the first half of this year, the total value of commodity purchases was 1.68 billion yuan, an increase of 1.2 times over the same period last year, of which the total value of commodity purchases in our city was 810 million yuan, an increase of 1.4 times. The total value of wholesale sales was 1.16 billion yuan, an increase of 73% over the same period last year. The total retail sales of social commodities reached 1.09 billion yuan, an increase of 43% over the same period last year. This year, whether in terms of the absolute increase or the rate of increase, it is higher than in previous years. The supply of major commodities has increased significantly. The supply situation in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year is as follows:

        Grain: Increased by 27%
        Edible oil: Increased by 54%
        Vegetables: Increased by 22%
        Aquatic products: Increased by 61%
        Sugar: Increased by 16%
        Pastries: Increased by 2.5 times
        Alcohol: Increased by 1 time
        Cotton cloth: Increased by 82%
        Wool and cotton: Increased by 2.3 times
        Cotton and wool clothing: Increased by 1.4 times
        Underwear: Increased by 2 times
        Towels: Increased by 48%
        Rubber shoes: Increased by 1.9 times
        Cloth shoes: Increased by 40%
        Soap: Increased by 88%
        Radios: Increased by 1.8 times
        Pens: Increased by 2.5 times
        Basins: Increased by 1.8 times

In the first half of this year, only pork and eggs had a slight decrease in market supply due to an increase in the part consumed by farmers. This is understandable as farmers' living standards have improved, and they consume more. Additionally, due to poor planning of daily industrial products and handicrafts, some items were temporarily in short supply. However, overall, the supply of clothing and most daily necessities, grains, and most side dishes was relatively sufficient in the first half of this year. Only a few commodities were in short supply. By arranging production, actively organizing supplies, and with the support of various places across the country, the supply situation of some daily industrial products and side dishes that were temporarily in short supply has improved since June.

The temporary tight supply of some commodities is mainly due to the increase in population and the number of employed people, thereby increasing purchasing power. Now, the purchasing power of society has not only partially but universally increased. In the past, only a small number of people had high purchasing power, while the vast majority had low purchasing power and little consumption. This situation has fundamentally changed, and the purchasing power of urban and rural people has universally increased. According to the changes in the market over the past ten years, this trend is very obvious. According to comparable figures, the total retail sales of social commodities increased from 220 million yuan in 1949 to 1.64 billion yuan in 1958, an increase of 6.4 times. In the same period, excluding the nine counties and one city newly incorporated into the city in 1958, the population increased from 2.36 million to 4.44 million, an increase of 88%. This means that the per capita retail sales of commodities have increased significantly.

After the implementation of the people's commune system and the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in the suburbs, a large number of rural women have participated in production labor, and the income and accumulation of commune members have significantly increased, making the purchasing power of rural areas grow even faster. According to statistics from the commercial stores of four people's communes in Tongzhou District's Majiabang and Yongledian, and Daxing District's Caoyu and Panggezhuang, in addition to a significant increase in the supply of production materials, the supply of consumer goods has also increased significantly. The supply of several major commodities in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year is as follows:

        Rubber shoes: Increased by 3.9 times
        Underwear: Increased by 3.4 times
        Enamel cups: Increased by 2.7 times
        Cloth shoes: Increased by 1 time
        Towels: Increased by 70%
        Socks: Increased by 57%

From the above statistics, it is not difficult to see that the purchasing power of urban and rural people has universally increased. The sales volume of daily industrial products in rural areas has even increased at a higher rate than the average increase in the city. Imperialists and domestic enemy elements slander our Great Leap Forward, saying the market situation is "chaotic." We say the situation is "very good." The vast majority of people, especially the majority of the population who are farmers, have improved their living standards and increased their consumption. Isn't this a great thing? Isn't this the benefit that the Great Leap Forward and people's communes have brought to the people?

Although there was a period when a small number of commodities, mainly some side dishes and certain daily industrial products, were in short supply, we believed that this phenomenon was temporary and that we had ways to improve the situation. Now, hasn't the situation improved? The fundamental solution is to increase production. Since this spring, we have made great efforts to arrange the production of side dishes and daily industrial products, and now we have achieved good results.

Regarding the production and supply of vegetables, since last winter, we have done a lot of work to increase the production of winter greenhouses and sunken fields, vigorously develop summer vegetable production, and the supply of vegetables has gradually improved since April and May this year, reaching an average daily sales volume of over 5 million catties in July, not only fully meeting the needs but also having some surplus. Recently, due to severe flooding in the main vegetable-producing areas, vegetable losses have been significant, leading to a temporary shortage of vegetable supply. With the support of various places across the country, the situation has improved, and it is estimated that after the arrival of large white cabbages and radishes in October and November, the supply of vegetables will improve. However, due to the increase in population and storage difficulties, it is impossible to have everything in abundance throughout the year in a city like Beijing with such climatic conditions, and adjustments will be needed.

Regarding the production of pork, chickens, and other side dishes, after adopting the policy of "walking on two legs" of collective feeding and individual feeding by commune members, the enthusiasm of commune members to raise poultry and livestock has significantly increased. At the same time, the state-owned farms in our city, which mainly produce side dishes, will gradually become an important base for urban side dish production. In addition, government agencies, troops, enterprises, and schools are also utilizing all possible conditions to raise some poultry and livestock to solve part of their own side dish supply problems. Currently, the number of pigs and chickens raised in all suburbs has increased significantly, but these pigs and chickens still need a breeding and fattening process. Therefore, to fundamentally improve the supply of these side dishes, it will still take some time.

Due to the development of production, the total value of commodity purchases in our city has increased by 1.4 times compared to the same period last year. This reflects the significant increase in the production of daily industrial products in our city. Among various daily industrial products, most commodities have significantly increased production and can meet the supply; some commodities that were temporarily in short supply have improved their supply situation after production arrangements; only a few commodities, such as rubber and leather products, are temporarily unable to fully supply due to insufficient raw materials and other reasons.

Some individuals whose thoughts have not been thoroughly reformed, such as some bourgeois and other exploiting class elements, say that nothing can be bought in Beijing, but what is the actual situation? Just in the Beijing Department Store, there are always over 32,000 types of commodities on sale. I ask these gentlemen, has Beijing ever had so many commodities before?

To promote the development of industrial and agricultural production and support the continued leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, we must further do a good job in commodity supply. The commercial sector should actively cooperate with the current increase and save movement on all production fronts, vigorously organize the supply of production materials in cities and rural areas, and the procurement of agricultural products, light industrial products, and handicrafts. We should also seriously improve warehouse management, reasonably allocate commodities, and plan the supply of living materials. Especially after the arrival of the autumn peak season, a large number of agricultural and sideline products will be on the market. The commercial sector should, in addition to focusing on the procurement of vegetables, meat, fruits, and medicines, also actively prepare for the procurement, transportation, and processing and storage of grain, cotton, and oil crops. At the same time, the commercial sector should mobilize the masses to vigorously improve enterprise management, accelerate capital turnover, reduce losses, and save costs; strive to improve service quality and improve service attitudes. The reform of commercial work initiated by Tianqiao Department Store in 1958, with the center of improving enterprise management level and service quality and improving service attitudes, has achieved great results. In the future, we must continue to further and broadly carry out this movement and continuously improve it. In the enthusiastic nationwide increase and save movement, commercial work must also achieve outstanding results in serving production and the masses.

(5) On cultural education and health work

1958 was also a year of great leap forward in Beijing's educational undertakings. By resolutely implementing the policy of education serving proletarian politics, serving the working people and socialism, and combining education with productive labor, the nature of education has fundamentally changed, breaking away from the old tradition of several thousand years where education was separated from productive labor and mental labor was separated from physical labor. Under the strengthened leadership of the Party, broad teachers and students, through practical labor, have basically overcome the erroneous views of looking down on physical labor and the working people, and to a large extent, changed the state of theory being separated from practice. This is a great revolution in education.

However, those untransformed bourgeois intellectuals have attacked our correct educational policy in various ways. They say, "The school is no longer in good shape." What is the fact? The old style of schools that only read books without labor indeed no longer exists; we have established new-type schools that combine teaching with labor. This is what a proletarian-led socialist country and people need. Isn't such an educational revolution a great thing?

Anyone who is willing to face facts cannot but admit that our educational undertakings are advancing in leaps and bounds. Last year, the total number of students in primary, secondary, and higher education in the city reached 1.18 million. On the basis of last year, there has been a significant development this year. Now, the total number of students in primary, secondary, and higher education and secondary specialized schools in the city has reached 1.35 million, accounting for one-fifth of the city's total population. In the past ten years since liberation, the number of students in higher education in Beijing has increased from 14,000 to 110,000, an increase of nearly seven times, and the number of secondary school students has increased from 43,000 to 260,000, an increase of five times. Primary education has been universalized. The development of education is so rapid, but the construction of school buildings cannot keep up with the needs, and many schools still have to implement the double-shift system; teachers have also increased, but there is still a shortage. These problems are obviously not something that can be solved overnight, and these must be solved gradually with the development of production.

Last year, 350,000 workers and peasants participated in part-time study, and significant achievements have been made in the elimination of illiteracy. Kindergartens have also developed significantly.

Educational work must be full of vigor and perseverance in implementing the Party's educational policy, arranging teaching and labor time better, and continuously improving the quality of education. For this, municipal and district educational administrative departments and schools at all levels must strengthen the leadership of teaching work, strengthen the teaching of basic courses, summarize and exchange good experiences, vigorously cultivate teachers, and compile a set of textbooks that can be used for a relatively long period. Higher education institutions should actively carry out scientific research work on the premise of focusing on teaching. To better make workers and peasants knowledgeable, we must actively continue to carry out literacy campaigns and do a good job in workers' and peasants' part-time education.

Cultural work has also seen a great leap forward. Last year, whether it was mass amateur cultural activities or professional cultural work, there was significant development. More than 2,400 professional cultural workers went deep into factories, mines, and rural areas, combining with workers and peasants, launching a high tide of mass amateur cultural activities, cultivating a large number of backbone members, and the professional cultural team itself was also tempered and improved. On this basis, this year, factory and rural amateur cultural activities have gradually deepened and become regular, and professional cultural activities have also flourished significantly. This year, during the National Day celebrations, a large number of excellent art performances will be presented to the audience. In the first half of this year, the number of new books published increased by more than 70% compared to the same period last year. Revolutionary museums, historical museums, and other museums and exhibitions will open or be on display during the National Day celebrations. In addition, many new outstanding young performers have emerged in the art world this year, and old artists have also shown greater enthusiasm. All these achievements are inseparable from the guidance and support of relevant central departments and the active support of various places across the country. In the future, cultural work should continue to resolutely implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," better serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism. Professional cultural workers must continue to strive to improve the quality of their creations and performances, using works with higher ideological and artistic levels to educate the people and meet the people's growing cultural needs. Factory and rural mass cultural activities should be carried out in various forms under the principle of combining production and voluntary participation.

In the field of health work, last year, a massive patriotic health campaign was launched with the center of eliminating four pests and controlling major diseases, significantly reducing the incidence of dysentery and controlling the spread of measles in winter. Broad medical staff, through the rectification movement, improved their political and ideological awareness, strengthened the idea of serving the masses, went out of hospitals, went to factories, rural areas, and communities, and brought medicine to the patients. Last year, in addition to the increase of 2,200 beds by the state and enterprises, various hospitals also increased some beds by tapping potential. The newly built modern maternity hospital with modern equipment was opened in the first half of this year. These all show that last year's medical and health work also made great strides.

Based on the summary of last year's great leap forward experience, we have rectified various medical institutions, especially large hospitals, and the medical quality of both large and small medical institutions has improved. Large hospitals and specialized hospitals not only have the responsibility of treating major diseases but also have the tasks of guiding general medical institutions, cultivating talents, and scientific research, that is, the task of improving medical standards. These hospitals must strengthen political and ideological leadership, improve service attitudes, unite Chinese and Western medicine, improve medical effects and medical technology levels, strictly implement advanced medical systems, and improve hospital management levels. The medical and preventive networks established in rural areas last year and the community work carried out in streets should be further strengthened and guided under the principle of graded and divided work.

To actively prevent diseases, we have carried out four large-scale health campaigns in the first half of this year, and since July, we have further mobilized the masses to continue two more campaigns, all of which have achieved good results. To further eliminate the four pests, we will carry out two more campaigns this month to make health work even better.

To enhance the physical fitness of the people, we must continue to carry out mass sports activities and, on this basis, strive to improve sports levels. The first National Games will be held in the capital soon, and we hope that the athletes of the capital will be friendly and cooperative with athletes from all over the country, learn from the good style and technology of athletes from all over the country, demonstrate good sportsmanship, and achieve good results.

Under the call to break superstitions and liberate thoughts, scientific research work has developed significantly last year, which is an important condition for our production leap forward, especially for improving labor productivity. We must be full of vigor and perseverance, with unyielding spirit and hard work, to seize new heights in science and technology. The combination of scientific research institutions and production units, and the combination of scientific researchers with practice, is a key to our achievements last year. In the future, we must further organize cooperation according to the scientific research plan and grasp the inspection. Scientific research work should first study the key scientific and technological problems in production and construction, concentrate forces, and break through key points. However, we should not neglect the frontier sciences that open up the way for future production and the basic theoretical sciences that indirectly serve production. For new technologies and new products that have been successfully researched, we should promptly identify and promote them. The number of scientific research institutions under the jurisdiction of Beijing has increased from more than ten in 1957 to the current 33. We must consolidate and strengthen these research institutions to further develop scientific research work.

The policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" in academia and "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in the arts is a long-term policy to promote academic prosperity and artistic flourishing. We have achieved results in implementing this policy, and academic discussions have gradually become lively, which is a good phenomenon. In the future, we must continue to firmly implement this policy.

(6) Oppose rightist tendencies, be full of vigor, and strive to overfulfill the 1959 leap forward plan

Comrades, the great achievements we have made under the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes in 1958 and this year have completely proven that the malicious slander of our general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes by domestic and foreign enemy elements is groundless. Our future is full of limitless brightness. Our current main task is to unswervingly continue to implement the spirit of the general line, be full of vigor, oppose rightist conservative thoughts and slacking tendencies, and launch a magnificent increase and save mass movement. We must use new achievements of the Great Leap Forward to respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, strive to complete the main indicators of the second five-year plan this year, strive to significantly overfulfill the Twelve-Year Agricultural Development Outline, and strive to catch up with Britain in the production of major industrial products within about ten years. We must pay attention to the fact that rightist conservatism is still the main danger in our current work. We must resolutely, thoroughly expose, criticize, and overcome rightist conservative thoughts, continue to be full of vigor, strive for the forefront, and implement the general line of socialist construction. From practical experience, we deeply feel that one can be inspired but not discouraged. Under the same objective conditions, the results of being inspired and slacking are completely different. Everyone still remembers that in July and August last year, there was a period when conservative thoughts played tricks, and many production targets determined through mass discussions were in danger of not being completed; but before and after the Eighth Session of the Municipal People's Congress last August, we held a series of mass mobilization meetings, everyone was inspired, and all the planned targets were overfulfilled. This year, in May and June, there was also a period when some people had rightist slacking tendencies; but after opposing rightist thoughts and being full of vigor, the production situation immediately changed, and production values increased day by day. We must always remember this precious experience and never forget it!

The call for launching the increase and save movement issued by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the people of the whole country should become the center of all our work at present. In industry, agriculture, basic construction, commerce, and other fronts, we must strive to increase production, work hard, and launch socialist labor competitions. In industry, by the end of this year, we must complete the production tasks of 800,000 tons of pig iron, 360,000 tons of steel, 200,000 tons of steel materials, and 6.35 million tons of raw coal, and strive to overfulfill them. In basic construction, we must concentrate our forces to ensure key projects, so that more enterprises, undertakings, and public buildings can quickly enter production or be handed over for use, and strive to achieve faster investment returns. In agriculture, in areas without disasters, we must strive for greater harvests to compensate for losses; in disaster-stricken areas, we must take production as the center of disaster relief, develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries according to local conditions, grasp autumn harvesting and sowing, and field management, especially grasp wheat sowing, launch a mass high tide of wheat sowing, and strive for an even greater harvest next year. In transportation, we must reasonably arrange transportation tasks, tap transportation potential, improve transportation efficiency, and launch technological revolutions to solve the two weak links of short-distance transportation and loading and unloading work. Commercial work must actively cooperate with the increase and save movement on all fronts, vigorously organize the supply of production materials and living materials in cities and rural areas, and vigorously organize the procurement of agricultural products, light industrial products, and handicrafts.

While striving for increased production, we must also strive for economy. On one hand, increase production, on the other hand, save, build the country thriftily, manage people's communes thriftily, manage all enterprises, undertakings, and households thriftily. This is the way to the prosperity and strength of our country and is also an important key to completing and overfulfilling this year's plan. In addition to saving in production, we must also carry out extensive propaganda and education on saving among the people of the whole city. Government agencies should take the lead in setting an example, be thrifty and diligent, and save all possible expenses. Among urban and rural residents, we should advocate saving grain, coal, electricity, and other consumer goods that are still not abundant, and advocate saving. We not only need to be good at arranging production but also need to be good at arranging life, living frugally, and planning carefully, leaving room for the future.

Political leadership and implementing the mass line are important guarantees for successfully launching the increase and save movement and overfulfilling the 1959 plan indicators, and are also principles that we must adhere to in doing all our work. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in the first half of this year not only specifically demonstrated the power of the general line of building socialism with more, faster, better, and cheaper efforts but also showed that our socialist construction must be carried out through magnificent mass movements.

We should always remember Chairman Mao's teachings. He said: "We must believe: (1) The broad masses of peasants are willing to gradually walk the socialist road under the leadership of the Party; (2) The Party can lead the peasants to walk the socialist road. These two points are the essence and mainstream of things. If we lack such confidence, we will not be able to basically build socialism in about three five-year plans." This was what Chairman Mao said four years ago. Today, we should still examine ourselves according to this passage, see if we have such full confidence in the masses and the Party? We must always adhere to and implement the mass line, fully mobilize the masses' surging revolutionary enthusiasm.

The methods of regularly holding mass meetings, five-level cadre meetings, and big debates formed in the nationwide rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward last year, as well as the good methods of cadres participating in labor, planting experimental fields, grasping typical cases, studying business, and frequently contacting grassroots masses, must be continued to promote our work to continue to advance.

Comrades, looking back, our achievements are very great; looking forward, our future is limitless. The workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other patriotic people of our capital should unite more closely under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, unite as one, and high-spiritedly raise the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, strive to overfulfill this year's leap forward plan, strive to complete the main indicators of the second five-year plan this year, and strive to create new glorious achievements of the Great Leap Forward on all fronts to welcome the great festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜前进
    北京市副市长万里在北京市第三届人民代表大会第二次会议上的报告各位代表：
    今天，正当首都的工人、农民和革命的知识分子热烈地响应中国共产党八届八中全会的号召，在各个战线上掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动新高潮的时候，我们北京市第三届人民代表大会第二次会议开幕了。这是具有十分重大意义的。
    中共八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议指出：“目前全党和全国各族人民的中心任务，就是要深入展开轰轰烈烈的厉行增产节约的群众运动，为完成和超额完成一九五九年的生产和建设计划而斗争。特别要抓紧今后一个多月的宝贵时机，掀起新的生产大高潮，使工业、农业、运输业在第三季度取得决定性的胜利，用这个胜利来迎接伟大的中华人民共和国成立的十周年。”
    为了完成这个光荣的任务，我们北京市人民，和全国人民一样，在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，鼓足干劲，在各个战线上展开热火朝天的继续大跃进的群众运动，不断地取得了新的胜利。在工业战线上，八月份全市职工以超额百分之十五点二的优异成绩完成了全月的产值计划，八月下旬平均日产值达到二千七百万元，创造了今年以来平均日产值的最高纪录。九月头五天的情况更好，全市工业的总产值比八月头五天增长了百分之三十八左右，主要产品的产量也都有很大的增长：如生铁增长百分之八，钢增长百分之八十七，钢材增长百分之四十二，煤增长百分之十六。在农业战线上，郊区在遭受严重水涝灾害的情况下，抢种了五十五万亩秋菜，超额完成了原订四十一万八千亩秋菜播种计划的百分之三十二。蓄水量四十一亿公方的密云水库，从去年秋季开工，到今年汛期已经拦洪，发挥了巨大的防汛作用，使潮白河下游十几个县份免遭洪水的灾害。在基本建设工程上，全体职工一鼓作气，突击未完工程，二十天中竣工面积达到七十六万平方米。大家都可以看到全国人民代表大会的建筑和中国革命博物馆、中国历史博物馆、中国人民革命军事博物馆、民族文化宫、北京车站、工人体育场等十项大建筑，不到一年的工夫就已经完成了。
    我们在社会主义建设事业各个方面不断跃进的事实，充分地证明了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的正确，它有力地粉碎了国内、国外一切敌对分子对我国社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的无耻诽谤和诬蔑。我们的社会主义革命和建设事业的伟大成就，决不因为任何诽谤和诬蔑而有所减色；相反的，国内外一切敌对分子越是加紧攻击我们的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，就越加证明我们是完全做对了，我们更要高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜，奋勇前进。
    我们为什么能够这样高速度地不断地向前跃进呢？这是因为旧社会遗留给我们的国民经济基础极端落后，使我们处于又穷又白的状态，而我国人民是不甘心于落后的，他们要求迅速地摆脱又穷又白的状态。因此，当着全国解放，人民掌握了自己的命运以后，他们就要求大规模地、高速度地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设。我们所以能够这样高速度地不断地向前跃进，还因为我们有以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导。党在每个时期规定了革命和建设的正确路线、方针和政策，密切联系群众，体现了人民的愿望和要求，引导人民从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。北京十年来的成就非常生动地证明了这个道理。
    十年来我们以不断革命的精神，不但彻底完成了各项民主改革，而且取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利，展开了大规模的社会主义建设工作，使我们首都的面貌，随着我们伟大祖国的飞跃发展而发生了巨大的变化。
    解放前的北京是一个落后的消费城市，当时几乎没有什么现代化的工业，一九四九年全市工业、手工业的产值只有一亿七千万元，全市产业工人只有七万多人；而一九五八年我们的工业、手工业的产值已增长到四十六亿元，比一九四九年增长了二十六倍。产业职工达到八十七万人，比一九四九年增长了十一倍以上。一九四九年北京的工业绝大部分是破破烂烂的小厂；而现在我们却已经有了一千人以上五千人以下的工厂九十七个，五千人以上的十三个。一九五八年一年的产值就增加了二十五亿元，超过了以前九年产值增长数的总和。这完全证明我们十年来是在不断的飞跃进步的过程中，而去年更是空前大跃进的一年。
    在解放的初期，郊区的农民还是分散的个体农户，封建的土地关系束缚着农业生产力的发展。当时没有一台拖拉机，没有什么动力排灌机械，能灌溉的耕地仅占全部耕地面积的百分之二点八；现在，郊区农村已经全部实现了人民公社化。到一九五八年底，我们已经拥有四百九十台拖拉机和八万九千多匹马力的各种排灌机械，能灌溉的耕地已占全部耕地面积的三分之一。一九五八年粮食每亩产量达到三百一十八斤，比一九五七年的二百一十六斤增长了百分之四十七。一年内增长这样多，这难道不是空前的大跃进吗？
    十年来新建房屋面积已达二千七百二十四万平方米，等于北京城原有建筑面积总和的一点三倍。在北京刚解放时，全市下水道只有二百八十公里，大部分淤塞不通，能使用的仅有二十公里，经过十年的建设，除将淤塞不通的下水道全部修通以外，还新建下水道五百六十一公里，管径和工程质量都远非旧日的下水道可比。铺装路面的道路，解放前只有二百一十九万平方米，现在已经达到了一千零八十一万平方米，并且有了像长安街那样宽阔的高级道路。解放时全市只有五辆公共汽车和四十九辆有轨电车，而现在公共交通车辆已经达到一千一百三十六辆。
    随着生产的发展和城市的改建，人民的物质生活和文化生活都有了显著的提高。全市在业人口由一九四九年的四十三万人，增长到一九五八年的一百六十二万人。除了社会劳保福利大大增长以外，从一九四九年到一九五八年，工业职工的平均工资增长了百分之七十多；每一个农业劳动力的平均收入，根据近郊区的统计，也增长了两倍多。
    解放时，本市小学学生只有十一万多人，中学学生只有四万多人，当时大约有一半的学龄儿童不能上小学，上中学和大学的更少。如果按照现在的区划计算，解放时小学学生为三十二万人，中学和师范学生为四万三千人，大学学生为一万四千人；现在，小学学生已达到九十一万六千人，中学和师范学生达到二十六万七千人，大学学生达到十一万多人。即小学生增长了近两倍，中学和师范学生增长了五倍，大学学生增长了近七倍。解放时北京较大的医院很少，全市医生和其他医务人员只有四千多人，病床只有三千张；一九五八年底医生和其他医务人员已增长到近三万人，病床增长到二万一千多张，增长了六倍多。
    这些事实都充分说明了我们十年来的成就是极为巨大的！这些事实无可辩驳地证明了社会主义制度的巨大优越性。特别是一九五八年，我们全市人民，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线光辉照耀下，意气风发，解放思想，苦干、实干、巧干，在各个战线上都掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，实现了空前的全面的大跃进，加快了国民经济发展的速度，充分显示了总路线的威力。
    十年来，特别是去年大跃进以来，我们积累了丰富的经验。总结这些经验，在已经取得的伟大胜利的基础上，响应中共八届八中全会的伟大号召，高举鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的胜利旗帜，继续跃进，这就是我们今后的光荣任务。现在我代表市人民委员会就几个主要方面的工作报告如下。
    （一）关于工业生产和基本建设
    北京市工业生产的情况一直是良好的。目前轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动的新高潮，正在工业战线上全面展开，工业产值日益增长。八月份工业总产值完成了五亿三千万元，超额百分之十五点二完成了月计划，比七月份增长百分之十九，其中钢的产量增长百分之十二点七，钢材增长百分之十七，生铁增长百分之二点七，水泥、电力、棉布、棉纱、毛织品等主要产品，都超额完成了计划。很多日用轻工业品，也在迅速增长。这个新的成绩是怎样取得的呢？这是在一九五八年大跃进的基础上继续跃进的结果。如果没有大跃进，我们简直不能想像怎么能够有这样的成绩。
    去年全市工业总产值完成四十六亿元，比一九五七年增加了一点一五倍，比一九四九年的一亿七千万元增长了二十六倍。而今年一月至八月已经完成四十亿三千多万元，比去年同期又增长了一倍多。国内外的敌对分子谩骂我们的大跃进是“大跃退”，他们连做梦也不敢想到世界上会有这样大的跃进。这只能怪他们眼光短浅，而又居心不良。至于我们大跃进的事实，那是决不会因此而被抹杀的。
    为了说明一九五八年工业生产的巨大跃进和今年的继续跃进，现在就让我们来看看以下几种主要产品发展的情况吧。
    第一是钢：在一九四九年，北京根本没有炼钢企业，在一九五七年即第一个五年计划完成的时候，钢的年产量也只有二万八千吨；而一九五八年一年的产量就达到了十六万吨（其中“洋钢”十二万多吨）。今年一至八月已经完成了二十万零六千吨“洋钢”。
    第二是钢材：一九四九年我们一吨钢材也不能轧制；到一九五七年也只生产一万四千多吨；一九五八年一年即跃进到年产五万八千四百吨。今年一至八月就完成了十一万八千吨。
    第三是生铁：一九四九年年产量不过二万六千吨；一九五七年已经增长到年产四十三万吨；一九五八年更进一步增长到年产五十二万吨，比一九四九年增长了将近十九倍。今年一至八月已经完成了四十五万四千吨。
    钢铁工业突飞猛进的发展这个事实，充分说明去年的大炼钢铁的群众运动，具有巨大的生命力，所得极大。国内外的敌对分子诬蔑我们大炼钢铁“失败了”，右倾机会主义分子也胡说什么大办钢铁是“得不偿失”。在铁的事实面前，这些论调都已不攻自破。
    第四是原煤：一九四九年年产量为一百一十一万吨，当时生产非常落后，全靠手工开采，没有现代化设备，而且雨季一到就常常淹窑停产；经过几年来的改进，增加了现代化设备。一九五七年增长到二百五十七万吨；一九五八年增长到四百六十万吨，比一九四九年增长三倍多。而且在采煤的设备和技术水平上也都有很大的提高，现在全市现代化的矿井有二十六个，生产过程已经基本上机械化或半机械化了。今年一至八月已经完成了四百零九万吨，比去年同期增长百分之六十八点五。
    第五是电力：一九四九年全市电力生产一亿五千万度；一九五七年为七亿度；一九五八年达到十亿零五千万度，比一九四九年增长六倍多。今年一至八月已经完成十一亿六千万度，超过了去年全年的发电量。
    第六是金属切削机床：一九四九年北京根本没有制造机床的工业，一九五七年年产一千九百台；一九五八年年产量增长到四千七百七十台，比一九五七年增长了一倍半，而且机床的品种也由两种增加到五十多种。今年一至八月已经完成二千七百多台，比去年同期增长百分之七点八。
    第七是动力机械：在解放初期北京根本不能生产任何动力机械；一九五七年全年也只生产了动力机械五百匹马力；一九五八年则增长到三万八千匹马力。今年一至八月已经完成了二万四千六百多匹马力，比去年同期增长一倍。
    第八是电子、无线电工业：解放初期我们在电子、无线电工业方面是一片空白。经过第一个五年计划的建设，我们已经建立起具有最新技术和最新设备的电子、无线电和电气通讯器材的工厂，为这项工业打下了良好的基础。一九五八年产品产量有了很大跃进，仅电子管一项就比一九五七年增长了大约两倍。今年预计可以比去年增长一倍左右。
    第九是棉纱：一九四九年北京根本没有现代的棉纺工业；在第一个五年计划期间我们陆续建设了一些规模较大的纺纱厂，全市纱锭达到二十四万个。一九五七年棉纱的年产量为十万零九千件；一九五八年增长到十八万件，一年中增长了百分之六十五。今年一至八月已经完成了十五万件，比去年同期增长百分之四十八点八。
    各位代表：以上这些重要的工业产品在解放初期多数是北京根本不能生产的，十年来，在中国共产党的领导下，经过全市人民的努力，经过全国各地的支援，和苏联以及其他兄弟国家有关的专家的帮助，并学习了苏联的先进经验，我们不但从无到有，而且通过第一个五年计划期间和一九五八年的建设，使这些工业有了飞跃的发展，特别是其中很多产品，在一九五八年一年中所增长的比第一个五年计划期间五年增长的还要多。如果没有一九五八年的大跃进，我们怎么能够想像会有这样巨大的成绩呢？
    一九五八年在降低成本和提高生产效率方面，所取得的成绩也很显著。和一九五七年比较，可比产品的成本平均降低了百分之十四点四；工业全员劳动生产率平均提高了百分之七十；特别是一九五八年新产品增加了几千种，有些产品的质量也有了改进。这说明了我们的工业技术水平有很大的提高。
    今年以来，我们不断反对右倾松劲情绪，特别是七月以来，反右倾的思想工作更加深入，广大工人群众的干劲更足，生产节节上升。从中共八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议公布以后，这一个巨大的推动力量，又进一步把本市的增产节约运动，迅速推到一个新的更大的高潮中去。现在可以看到这个新的高潮具有一些新的特点：
    第一，一开始就出现了群众性的技术革新的热潮。如兴平机械厂真空泵车间，几乎每道工序都有技术革新，全车间的生产效率提高了将近二倍；民用灯具厂从八月二十七日以来，已经实现了九十一项技术革新，有的提高效率达十五倍。
    第二，很多工厂普遍地突破了生产定额。如华北无线电器材厂第二分厂在中共八届八中全会公报公布后的五天内，在八百五十九名规定了生产定额的工人中，就有七百四十一人突破了定额；民用灯具厂四百二十五人中有三百六十三人突破了定额。
    第三，更广泛地出现了群众性的比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛运动，很多职工天天创造新纪录。第一机床厂的姜东来小组过去每日锻铣床主轴十八根，在这次运动中，八月二十六日锻出二十八根，二十七日锻出三十二根，二十八日锻出三十四根，二十九日锻出三十八根，每天都创造新纪录。北京电子管厂，八月份产值超过计划百分之七十一，废品率比七月份降低百分之十二。
    现在空前高涨的大生产运动正在继续发展，从一个胜利引向另一个胜利。
    在基本建设方面，因为北京是我们的首都，在城市改建和国家机关文教事业的建设方面都需要相当数量的投资，但是我们仍然不断地增加了工业建设投资的比重，特别是一九五八年，工业基本建设投资达五亿九千万元，占当年基本建设投资总额将近一半，比一九五七年增长了两倍半，相当于第一个五年计划期间本市工业基本建设投资总额的百分之六十以上。一九五八年新建和扩建的项目中，到年底已经建成或部分建成并投入生产的有一百三十三个，其中限额以上的有三十二个。经过十年，特别是通过第一个五年计划期间和一九五八年的建设，本市在钢铁冶炼工业、机电制造工业、电子无线电工业、化学工业、建筑材料工业、棉毛纺织工业等方面，都已经具有一定的规模，为首都的工业化打下了初步的基础。但是距离一个现代化的工业城市的目标还很远，今后我们的建设任务还很艰巨。
  我们根据全国一盘棋的精神和集中力量保证重点的方针，对今年的基本建设项目作了安排，通过本市财政预算的基本建设投资总额为一亿六千万元，主要的部分仍然集中使用在工业方面，八个限额以上的项目中有六个是属于工业方面的，主要有特殊钢厂、汽轮机厂、一机床厂、铸锻件厂、第二化工厂、搪瓷厂等；属于文化企业的有北京电影制片厂；市政公用事业方面列入了自来水工程的新项目。此外，由中央投资兴建的还有东郊热电站、北京轴承厂等三十几个项目。中央和地方的基本建设投资合计为十二亿三千万元。
    一九五九年我们制订的全市工业产值计划是六十五亿元，比一九五八年又增长百分之四十一。按照这个计划，钢、钢材、工业用的轴承、机车、货车等都将增长一倍乃至几倍；生铁、电力、联合收割机、植物油等都将增长百分之五十以上；原煤、烧碱、棉纱、机制纸等都将增长百分之二十五以上。
    按照今年的工业生产计划，全年要完成六十五亿元产值，也就是说，今后几个月平均每月要完成六亿多元的产值，比前八个月平均的月产值要提高百分之二十二，比八月份要提高百分之十五。因此，我们的任务还是十分艰巨的，必须鼓足干劲，紧紧抓住当前的有利形势，发动职工群众，进一步深入开展增产节约运动，提高劳动生产率，大力增加生产，提高质量，节约原材料，降低成本，加强企业管理，加强设备维修，保证安全生产，大闹技术革命，改进劳动组织，实干结合巧干，争取按月按季地全面完成和超额完成今年的工业生产计划。
    （二）关于农业生产
    一九五八年也是我们农村工作全面大跃进的一年，这主要表现在农业生产的空前大丰收，秋季的深翻种麦，大规模地兴修水利，农业基本建设的扩大，全郊区实现了人民公社化，公社大办工业，大办集体福利事业等方面。
    解放以来，我们的农业生产水平有了很大的提高。根据近郊区的统计，一九五八年棉花亩产量为六十斤，蔬菜亩产量为五千一百六十八斤，分别比一九四九年的十六斤和一千六百斤增长了两倍多。一九五八年，经过核实，粮食亩产量达到三百一十八斤，比一九四九年亩产一百二十七斤增长了一倍多。而一九五八年增长的速度比以往几年更快，粮食的亩产量比一九五七年的亩产二百一十六斤增长了百分之四十七。这是一个特大的跃进。
    今年小麦的大丰收是郊区农业新的跃进的标志。各人民公社在小麦的种植过程中充分发挥了社员群众的冲天干劲，贯彻执行了农业生产的“八字宪法”所规定的各项增产措施，积累了丰富的经验。去年秋季扩大了小麦播种面积，一般地都深翻一尺左右，普遍地实行了密植，增施了更多的底肥，大部分麦田都浇了水，并且加强了麦田的田间管理工作，因而使得今年的小麦获得了空前的大丰收。今年小麦的总产量达到二亿一千八百多万斤，比去年的一亿六千一百万斤增长了百分之三十五。出现了大面积的丰产田，亩产五百斤以上的麦田达一万二千多亩，其中有三十多亩亩产千斤以上。
    为了供应城市人口对蔬菜的不断增长的需要，我们逐年地扩大了各种蔬菜的种植面积。大力发展了夏菜、秋菜的生产，并且增设了阳畦、温室以提高春菜产量。按原来的七个近郊区比较，十年来蔬菜的总产量由一九四九年的一亿零七百万斤增长到一九五八年的近十六亿斤，增长了十三倍以上，而在一九五八年一年内就增长了近四亿斤。
    一九五八年农业战线上的跃进，还表现在农业积累和基本建设的迅速扩大方面。从一九五七年冬季就开始了大兴水利的运动，一九五八年一年内连续建成了十三陵水库和怀柔水库，同时各人民公社还修建了九十多个小型水库，连同挖渠等的工程量共达八千五百万土石方。这些水库大部分在当年就发生了效益。全郊区实际受益的灌溉面积从一九五七年的五十八万亩增长到二百三十七万亩。去年秋天开始，在中央直接领导下，与河北省共同建设的密云水库，工程量达三千七百多万土石方，现在已完成了两千五百多万土石方，主坝已达拦洪高程，建成后蓄水量相当于六十个十三陵水库，参加水库建设的民工经常达二十万人。这些水利工程的修建，为今后农业增产和防止水旱灾害，创造了极其有利的条件。一九五八年农业的积累也迅速增加。一年内增加了一百六十二台拖拉机，比一九五七年增长了百分之七十；排灌机械增加了两万三千五百匹马力，比一九五七年增长了一点四倍。
    一九五八年秋后，在一个极短的时间内，全郊区势如潮涌般地实现了人民公社化。并且立即掀起了深翻土地的高潮，深翻土地的面积达六百万亩，其中约有四百五十万亩土地深翻一尺到一尺五寸，同时还兴办了几千个社办工厂，展开了冬季副业大生产运动，迅速地扩大了农业积累，举办了大批的食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，解放了大批的妇女劳动力，并且抽调了八、九万壮劳动力参加密云水库的建设。事实证明人民公社显然更便于实行统一规划，能够举办农业生产合作社所无力举办的较大的生产事业和基本建设，便于统筹全社的生产和分配，合理地安排劳动力和举办各种集体福利事业。现在由郊区二百八十万农民所组织起来的七十六个大规模的、工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社，在按照统一领导、分级管理、分级核算、按劳分配的原则进行了整顿以后，已经走上了巩固的健全的发展道路。
    今年在各人民公社的统一规划和统一领导下，郊区农村农、林、牧、副、渔各项生产继续全面跃进。除了小麦大丰收以外，粮食作物的春、夏播种面积，完成了六百零七万亩，超额完成了计划；春、夏播蔬菜完成了四十八万多亩；秋菜播种五十五万亩，比去年增长了两倍半。除了供应市场和农民自食的以外，目前鸡的饲养数已达到四百五十三万只，比年初的二百五十万只增加了百分之八十多；猪的圈存数达到一百零七万头，比年初的八十九万头增加了百分之二十。除了生产方面的跃进之外，今年又增加了拖拉机一百二十八台，排灌机械两万多匹马力。这一切都说明了在人民公社的统一规划下，今年农村的生产和基本建设的继续跃进。国内外的敌对分子说什么“人民公社搞糟了”，“公社内的农民开始失去对增加生产的兴趣”，这不是无耻的造谣又是什么呢？特别是在今年抗涝救灾的斗争中，人民公社的作用更加显著。今年的水涝灾害，由于雨量之大是近几十年来所未有的，降雨的时间和地点又十分集中，七、八两月累计降雨一千零六十六毫米，比常年全年降雨量还多四百多毫米。虽然几条大河由于我们兴建了水库没有成灾，但是重要的产菜区、产粮区和重要的副食品基地却造成了严重的内涝灾害。灾情最严重的大兴区遭受涝灾的耕地有八十一万亩，占全区耕地面积的百分之九十。全郊区淹地共达二百五十万亩，约为郊区全部耕地面积的三分之一。在这种严重灾害面前，勤劳勇敢的郊区农民，在人民公社的光辉旗帜下，抱定了人定胜天的抗灾决心，以冲天的干劲，向雨涝灾害展开了顽强的斗争，他们冒着倾盆大雨，日夜抢险、排涝，抢救庄稼，抢种秋菜。不少地方冒雨抢种秋菜，种了被冲，冲了又种，反复三、四次甚至于五次。经过这样的顽强战斗，现在已排出二百三十万亩土地的积水，并且超额完成了秋菜播种计划。
    一九五八年国营农场有很大的发展，牛奶、猪、鸡、菜的生产都有迅速的增长。这些国营农场应当以生产副食品为主，并成为本市副食品生产的重要基地。
    现在全市有几个大水库和一些人工湖，水面共达四十三万亩，应该好好地利用起来，发展淡水养鱼。
    当前郊区各人民公社的任务是要抓紧时机，立即动员组织一切力量，作好以秋收、种麦和秋菜田间管理为中心的生产工作，力争秋季大丰收和打下明年继续跃进的基础。在秋收当中要作到熟一块、收一块，一定要比去年收得好、收得快、收得干净。同时要立即掀起一个种麦高潮，精耕细作，及时播种。争取秋播小麦扩大到一百五十万亩左右，并且开展大面积丰产田运动，力争单位面积产量大大超过今年的麦收。在蔬菜生产方面，主要是切实管理好已经种上的五十五万多亩秋菜，防治病虫，力争超额完成秋菜的计划产量，并且搞好冬季温室、阳畦和根茬菜的生产。为了防止今后的旱涝灾害，在今冬明春，要开展大规模的兴修水利运动，统一规划、统一领导，对今年雨涝积水的特点加以系统的调查研究，对现有的河道、渠道和涵洞，进行全面的整修，使之既能灌溉，又能宣泄，并且要使现有的二百四十五万亩有效灌溉面积发展到四百万亩左右，为明年农业继续跃进创造更为有利的条件。为了进一步提高农业生产的劳动效率，除了要继续改进劳动组织、挖掘劳动潜力之外，要力争在今后三五年内实现耕作、排灌的机械化和半机械化，要努力改良农村的运输工具，要力争生产和供应更多的化肥。
    农村公共食堂、托儿组织必须坚持积极办好，自愿参加，继续实行粮食按人定量，分配到户，节约归己的原则，千方百计地把公共食堂、托儿所办好。
    （三）关于城市建设
    和工业、农业一样，在城市建设方面，从一九五八年以来也出现了大跃进，大规模地进行了城市改建工作，使我们的首都日益向着现代化的目标迅速前进。
    在建筑工程方面，一九五八年和一九五九年的规模都超过了解放以来的任何一年。一九五八年全年竣工的建筑面积，由第一个五年计划期间平均每年的三百万平方米增长到四百五十七万平方米。一九五九年到八月底止，已经开工的建筑面积达三百三十七万平方米，已经完成的建筑安装工作量达四亿六千万元，比去年同期增长了一点二倍。
    主要的建筑工程是兴建和扩建石景山钢铁厂、北京钢厂、特殊钢厂、炼焦化学厂、汽轮机厂、第一机床厂、农业机械厂等工厂，兴建了全国人民代表大会的建筑和中国革命博物馆、中国历史博物馆、中国人民革命军事博物馆、民族文化宫、北京车站、工人体育场等大型公共建筑。我们在集中力量突击工业基本建设和这一些巨大的公共建筑的同时，还兴建了一批科学研究机构、大中小学校和住宅建筑，从一九五八年初到今年八月底已经竣工的面积达二百六十多万平方米；其中包括住宅宿舍达一百八十多万平方米。
    大跃进以来，北京的建筑业在工程质量、施工速度、技术水平、管理水平等各个方面都有飞跃的进步。许多工程量很大、装修标准较高、具有新式设备的重要建筑，都是在不到一年的时间内完成的。如目前全国最大的具有现代化设备的北京车站是在今年一月开工的，预计本月中旬即可交付使用。规模宏伟的人民革命军事博物馆，在今年七月底即已落成。全国人民代表大会的建筑规模最大，面积达十七万多平方米，比故宫的全部建筑面积还要大，结构十分复杂，有六十多米跨度的钢梁，最大的钢梁重达一百四十一吨；这个建筑的钢筋混凝土达十二万七千多立方米，大理石、花岗石、水磨石等十七万多平方米，并且具有复杂的通风、广播、电视、译意风、煤气、热力等设备。这个工程从开始设计到完工还不到一年。像以上这样一些大的工程，在这样短的时间内完成，这应该说是中国建筑史上空前的最大的跃进！那些攻击、诬蔑或者怀疑我国大跃进的人们，让他们来看看我们的这许多大规模的建筑吧！
    在市政工程和公用设施方面，由于工业大发展和首都改建的需要，一九五八年完成的工程总量比一九五七年增长了将近一倍；而一九五九年又将比一九五八年增长近百分之八十。一九五九年的市政工程主要是：完成了天安门广场的改建工程，广场的规模由原来的十一公顷扩大到现在的四十公顷；完成了东长安街的道路改建工程和由东单到西单的地下管道工程；特别是为现代化城市所不可缺少的热力和煤气，经过去年小型试办之后，今年开始进行了大规模的建设，预计今年可以建成热力干管十一公里，煤气干管二十一公里。一九五八年以来公共交通事业也有很大的发展和改进，为了适应城市发展的需要、改善公共交通、减少城市嘈杂，内城区的有轨电车线路已经全部拆除，同时增加了无轨电车一百四十二辆，公共汽车三百九十五辆。
    一九五八年以来，我们在城市建设方面所以能够实现这样的大跃进，是由于我们在总路线的光辉照耀下，在工作中贯彻执行了集中力量、确保重点、突击重点的方针；把集中领导和群众运动结合起来，把群众的冲天干劲和细致的管理工作结合起来，改进了技术管理和施工管理；而更重要的是城市建设战线上广大职工解放了思想，鼓足了冲天的干劲，把苦干、实干、巧干结合起来，进行着忘我的劳动。充分表现了主人翁的自觉。右倾机会主义分子不仅闭着眼睛，看不见大跃进的辉煌成就，而且反对总路线，害怕放手发动群众，他们把轰轰烈烈的群众运动说成是“小资产阶级的狂热性”。事实证明如果没有总路线，没有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，就不可能有这样的大跃进，这难道不是很清楚的吗？
    十年来我们的城市建设工作确有很大的发展，今天的情况比北京解放以前的“无风三尺土，有雨一街泥”的情景有了根本的改变，破旧的房屋已经拆除了一百五十多万平方米，建造了两千七百二十四万平方米的新建筑，从封建时代残留下来的妨碍现代化市政建设的城墙，已经开始拆除了一部分。但是目前的北京距离一个完全现代化城市的标准还很远。十年来我们虽然建成了一千多万平方米的住宅和很多市政交通设施，但是我们的住房仍感不足，公共交通和自来水的供应也还赶不上日益增长的需要。这是发展中的困难。首都的改建与扩建工作是一个长期的严重的任务，需要大量的人力、物力和投资。在目前我们集中主要力量发展工业和农业生产，并且城市人口不断迅速增长的情况下，不可能很快地完全满足市民对住宅、公共交通和其他公共设施的要求。这些问题，只能随着生产的不断发展逐步解决。
    今后的几个月，在建筑工程方面，除了应该坚决地把即将完工的基本建设项目迅速突击完工、交付使用以外，还应该大力突击重要的工厂、科学研究机构、学校和住宅等建筑工程；在市政工程方面要抓紧水源井和自来水管线的扩建工程；并且抓紧进行敷设煤气、热力管道的支线和户线，以发挥煤气、热力的效用。在设计和施工方面，都应该继续贯彻执行总路线，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，掀起大跃进的新高潮，提高生产效率，保证工程质量，厉行节约，反对浪费。设计工作要认真贯彻适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观的方针，设计人员要深入现场、结合实际、调查研究、总结经验，不断地提高设计水平和逐步推广标准化设计。施工方面要进一步改进施工管理，健全各种制度，改进劳动组织，同时要加强施工机械的管理和使用，提高设备的利用率。
    首都建设的速度将要不断提高，目前我们的建筑和市政工程的机械化施工水平还不高，手工劳动还占有相当大的比重，这种落后的状况决不足以适应迅速改建城市的需要。我们必须采取两条腿走路的方针，一面改善劳动组织，改进手工操作方法；一面随着首都工业的发展，逐步提高施工的机械化与半机械化的程度。现在就应该着手解决建筑机械的生产，大力培养机械化施工的技术力量。以提高首都建筑、市政企业施工的技术水平。
    在城市规划方面，必须把近期建设和长远规划结合起来，既要从当前国家的生产水平和人民生活水平出发，又要考虑到将来发展的需要。必须对城市的各项建设，如工厂、住房、商店、学校、道路、上下水道等全面考虑，统筹安排、加强对城市规划的管理。
    由于基本建设和工农业生产的迅速发展，今年的铁路、公路货运量都有很大的增长。当前除了抓紧运输任务的合理安排，提高运输工作的效率以外，还必须充分发挥全市运输工具的潜力，组织机关企业和郊区的各种运输工具参加运输。对于短途运输和装卸力量不足的困难，应该发动群众，大搞技术革命，集中力量加以解决。并且要逐步地增加机动车辆，实现运输工作和装卸工作的机械化或半机械化。
    （四）关于市场的商品供应问题
    随着工农业生产的继续跃进、各项建设事业的迅速发展和城市人口的迅速增长，本市的商品市场空前扩大，商品的收购数量和销售数量都增长很快。今年上半年商品购进总值为十六亿八千万元，比去年同期增长一点二倍，其中，本市产品收购总值为八亿一千万元，增长一点四倍。批发销售总值为十一亿六千万元，比去年同期增长百分之七十三。社会商品零售额达到十亿九千万元，比去年同期增长百分之四十三。今年以来无论从增长的绝对数和增长的速度来看，都比过去历年要高，主要商品的供应量有很大的增长。今年上半年的供应量比去年同期增长情况如下：
        粮食　增长　百分之二十七
        食油　增长　百分之五十四
        蔬菜　增长　百分之二十二
        水产　增长　百分之六十一
        食糖　增长　百分之十六
        糕点　增长　二点五倍
        酒　增长　一倍
        棉布　增长　百分之八十二
        呢绒　增长　二点三倍
        棉毛衫裤　增长　一点四倍
        汗衫背心　增长　二倍
        毛巾　增长　百分之四十八
        胶鞋　增长　一点九倍
        布鞋　增长　百分之四十
        肥皂　增长　百分之八十八
        收音机　增长　一点八倍
        金笔　增长　二点五倍
        面盆　增长　一点八倍
    今年上半年，只有猪肉、蛋品等因为农民自食的部分增加了，市场供应量减少了一些；由于农民的生活提高了，他们多消费一些，这也是可以理解的。另外，由于我们对于日用工业品和手工业品的生产安排得不够好，所以有少数品种曾一度供应不足。但是总的来说，今年上半年属于穿的和多数用的商品，粮食和大部分副食品的供应都是比较充足的，供应不足的只不过是极少的一部分商品。经过抓紧安排生产，积极组织货源，并且在全国各地的支援下，某些供应不足的日用工业品和副食品，六月以后供应的情况已经有了好转。
    某些商品供应一时紧张，主要是由于人口的增加和就业人数增加，因而购买力提高的结果。现在社会的购买力不是部分地而是普遍地提高了。过去是一少部分人有很高的购买力，而绝大多数人的购买力很低、消费量很少。现在这种情况已经发生了根本变化，城乡人民的购买力普遍提高。根据十年来市场变化的情况，这种趋势十分明显。按照可比的数字计算：社会商品零售额从一九四九年的二亿二千万元增长到一九五八年的十六亿四千万元，即增长了六点四倍；在这同一时期内，除去一九五八年新划入本市的通州等九县一市外，人口从二百三十六万增长到四百四十四万，即增长了百分之八十八。这就是说，按人平均的商品零售额有了很大的增长。
    郊区实现了人民公社化和农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展以后，大批农村妇女参加生产劳动，社员收入和公社积累大大增加，农村购买力增长得更快。根据通州区马驹桥、永乐店和大兴区采育、庞各庄四个人民公社的商店统计，除了生产资料的供应大大增加以外，消费资料也增长的很多。上半年几种主要商品的供应量比去年同期增长的情况是：
        胶鞋　增长　三点九倍
        汗衫背心　增长　三点四倍
        搪瓷口杯　增长　二点七倍
        布鞋　增长　一倍
        毛巾　增长　百分之七十
        袜子　增长　百分之五十七
    从以上的统计不难看出，城乡人民的购买力有了普遍的增长。农村日用工业品销售额增长的比例甚至比全市平均增长的比例还高。帝国主义者和国内敌对分子污蔑我们大跃进以来市场情况“混乱”，我们却要说“情况很好”。广大人民特别是占全国人口绝大多数的农民，生活提高了，消费量增加了，这难道不是一件大大的好事吗？这不正是大跃进、人民公社给人民带来的好处吗？
    虽然曾经有一个时期有一小部分商品，主要是少数副食品和某些日用工业品供应不足，当时我们就认为，这种现象是暂时的，我们有办法改善这种状况。现在不是改善了吗？改善的根本办法是增加生产。从今年春季起，我们用很大力量进行了副食品和日用工业品生产的安排，现在已经收到了很好的效果。
    关于蔬菜的生产和供应，从去年冬天起我们就作了很多工作，增加了冬季温室、阳畦蔬菜的生产，大力发展了夏季蔬菜生产，蔬菜的供应情况从今年四、五月起，就已经逐渐改善，到了七月份销售量平均每日达到五百多万斤，不但充分满足了需要，而且还有一些剩余。最近一个时期因为主要的菜区受到严重涝灾，蔬菜损失很大，以至蔬菜供应暂时又有些困难。经过全国各地的大力支援目前已经有好转，估计在十月、十一月大白菜、萝卜等上市以后，蔬菜供应的情况就可以改善。但是因为人口的增加和保管上的困难，在像北京这样的气候条件下，不可能一年四季样样俱全，需要调剂着吃。
    关于猪、鸡等副食品的生产，在采取了集体喂养和社员自己喂养两条腿走路的方针以后，社员们饲养家禽、家畜的积极性大大提高了。同时，本市的国营农场也是以生产副食品为主的，并且将日益成为城市副食品生产的重要基地。此外，机关、部队、企业、学校等集体伙食单位，也正在利用一切可能的条件，饲养一部分家禽、家畜，以解决他们自己的一部分副食品供应问题。目前全部郊区饲养的猪、鸡都已经增加了不少，但是，这些猪、鸡还需要一个繁殖和育肥过程，因此要根本改善这些副食品的供应，还需要一些时间。
    由于生产的发展，本市产品收购的总值比去年同期增长了一点四倍。这反映了本市日用工业品生产的巨大增长。在各种日用工业品中，多数商品，因为增产很多，已能满足供应；有些商品，一时供应不足，在生产上加以安排后，供应情况也已经好转；只有一部分商品，例如橡胶、皮革等制品，由于原料不足等原因，一时还不能充分供应。
    有少数思想尚未改造好的资产阶级分子和其他剥削阶级分子，说在北京什么也买不到，而实际情况怎样呢？仅百货大楼经常出售的就有三万二千多种商品。请问这些先生们，北京过去什么时候有过这样多的商品呢？
    为了促进工农业生产的发展，为了支持工农业生产继续跃进，进一步作好商品的供应工作，商业部门应该积极地配合目前各个生产战线上的增产节约运动，大力组织城乡生产资料的供应和农产品、轻工业品、手工业品的收购，并且认真改善仓库的管理，合理地调拨商品，有计划地组织生活资料的供应。特别是秋后旺季已经到来，农副产品将要大量上市，商业部门除了要抓紧蔬菜、肉类、水果、药材等的收购以外，还要积极地做好粮食、棉花、油料的收购、运输以及加工保管的准备工作。同时，商业部门要发动群众大力改善企业的经营管理，加速资金周转，降低损耗，节约费用；努力提高服务质量，改善服务态度。一九五八年由天桥百货商场发起的以提高企业经营管理水平和服务质量、改善服务态度为中心的改革商业工作的群众运动，已经取得了巨大的成绩，今后还必须继续更加深入地广泛地开展，并且不断加以提高。在轰轰烈烈的全民增产节约的运动中，商业工作也一定要在为生产、为群众服务方面作出更出色的成绩。
    （五）关于文化教育和卫生工作
    一九五八年也是北京市教育事业大跃进的一年。由于我们坚决地贯彻执行了教育为无产阶级的政治服务、为劳动人民、为社会主义服务，教育与生产劳动结合的方针，使教育事业发生了根本性质的变化，改变了几千年来教育与生产劳动脱节、脑力劳动与体力劳动分离的旧传统。在党的领导加强的前提下，广大师生通过劳动的实践，基本上克服了轻视体力劳动、轻视劳动人民的错误观点，在很大程度上改变了理论与实际相脱离的状态。这是教育事业上的一个大革命。
    但是，那些未经改造的资产阶级知识分子却百般地攻击我们的这个正确的教育方针。他们说：“学校搞得不像样子了。”事实是怎么样呢？过去只读书不劳动的那种学校的老样子的确已经不存在了；我们已经建立了又有教学又有劳动的新型学校。这是无产阶级领导的社会主义国家和人民所需要的。这样的教育革命难道不是一件大大的好事吗？
    只要是愿意正视事实的人，都不能不承认，我们的教育事业是在不断的跃进中。去年全市大、中、小学生的总数已达到一百一十八万人。在去年的基础上，今年又有很大的发展。现在全市大、中、小学和中等专业学校学生总数已达到一百三十五万人，占全市总人口的五分之一。解放十年来，北京市高等学校学生从一万四千多人增长到十一万人，增长了近七倍，中学学生从四万三千人增长到二十六万人，增长了五倍。小学已经普及。教育发展这样迅速，但是校舍的建设赶不上需要，许多学校还要办二部制；教员也增加了不少，但是还感不足。这些问题显然都不是一下子可以解决的，这些都必须随着生产的发展逐步地解决。
    去年一年中，参加业余学习的工农群众达到了三十五万人，扫除文盲的工作有很大的成绩，幼儿园也有很大的发展。
    教育工作必须鼓足干劲，坚持不渝地贯彻执行党的教育方针，把学习和劳动的时间安排得更好，不断地提高教育质量。为此，市、区教育行政部门和各级学校都必须加强对教学工作的领导，加强基础课的教学，总结和交流好的经验，大力培养师资，并且要编好一套可以较长期使用的教材；高等学校要在以教学为主的前提下积极开展科学研究工作。为了更好地使工农知识化，要积极地继续开展扫盲工作，办好工农业余教育。
    文化工作也出现了巨大的跃进。去年无论是群众业余文化活动和专业文化工作都有很大的发展。二千四百多名专业文化工作者深入厂矿、农村，同工农群众相结合，掀起了群众业余文化活动的高潮，培养出大批骨干分子，而专业文化队伍本身也受到了锻炼和提高。在这个基础上，今年工厂农村业余文化活动逐步地走向深入和经常化，专业的文化活动也大大繁荣起来。今年国庆节将有大批优秀的文艺节目和观众见面。今年上半年，新书的发行数量比去年同期增加了百分之七十多。革命博物馆、历史博物馆和其他博物馆、展览会等，都将在国庆期间先后开馆或展出。此外，今年在文艺界涌现出许多新的优秀的青年演员，而老的艺术家也发挥了更大的积极性。所有这些成绩的获得，都是同中央有关部门的指导帮助和全国各地的积极支援分不开的。今后文化工作方面，仍然应当坚决贯彻执行百花齐放、推陈出新的方针，更好地为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务。专业文化工作者必须继续努力提高创作和演出的质量，以思想性、艺术性更高的作品，来教育人民，满足人民群众不断增长的文化需要。工厂、农村的群众文化活动应当在配合生产坚持业余自愿的原则下，用多种、多样形式，加以开展。
    在卫生工作方面，去年开展了以除四害、消灭主要疾病为中心的、轰轰烈烈的群众性的爱国卫生运动，使痢疾的发病率大大下降，控制了冬季麻疹的蔓延。广大医务人员通过整风运动提高了政治思想觉悟，加强了为群众服务的观点，他们走出医院，下厂、下乡、下地段，把医药送到病家。去年除了由国家投资和企业投资增设病床两千二百多张以外，各医院还挖掘潜力增加了一部分病床。新建的有现代化设备的妇产医院已于今年上半年开幕。这些都说明，去年在医药卫生工作方面也有巨大的跃进。
    在总结去年大跃进丰富经验的基础上，我们对各种医疗机构特别是大型医院进行了整顿，不论大、小医疗机构的医疗质量都有所提高。大医院和专科医院不但要负责进行治疗重大的疾病，而且有指导一般医疗机构、培养人材和科学研究的任务，也就是说，担负有提高医疗水平的任务。这些医院，必须加强政治思想领导，改进服务态度，团结中西医，提高医疗效果、医疗技术水平，严格执行先进的医疗制度，提高医院的管理水平。去年在农村建立的医疗预防网和在街道开展的地段工作，应当在贯彻分级分工的原则下，继续加强对他们的指导和帮助。
    为了积极预防疾病，今年上半年我们已经进行了四次群众性的卫生突击运动，从七月份起，我们又进一步发动群众，继续进行了两次突击运动，都收到很好的效果。为了进一步消灭四害，在本月内我们要再进行两次突击运动，把卫生工作搞得更好。
    为了增强人民体质，必须继续开展群众性的体育运动，并在这个基础上努力提高体育水平。第一届全国运动会即将在首都举行，希望首都的运动员能和各地的运动员友爱合作，很好地学习各地运动员的优良作风和技术，表现出优良的体育道德，取得优良的成绩。
    在破除迷信、解放思想的号召下，去年的科学研究工作有很大的开展，这是我们生产跃进、特别是提高劳动生产率的重要条件之一。我们必须鼓足干劲、扎扎实实地，以坚毅不拔的精神和刻苦的努力，来夺取科学技术的新阵地。科学研究机关和生产单位相结合，科学研究人员联系实际，是我们去年取得成绩的一个关键。今后要进一步按照科学研究的规划，组织协作，并抓紧检查。科学研究工作首先要研究生产建设中关键性的科学技术问题，集中力量，突破重点。但是，对于为将来生产开辟道路的尖端科学，和间接为生产服务的基础理论科学，也不应该忽视。对于已经研究成功的新技术和新产品，要抓紧鉴定和推广。北京市市属的科学研究机构，已经由一九五七年的十多个发展到目前的三十三个，我们必须巩固和充实这些研究机构，以利科学研究工作进一步地开展。
    学术上的“百家争鸣”、艺术上的“百花齐放”是促使学术昌盛和艺术繁荣的长远方针，我们执行这个方针已经有了效果，学术界的讨论已经渐渐活泼起来，这是很好的现象。今后一定要继续坚持贯彻这个方针。
    （六）反右倾、鼓干劲，为超额完成一九五九年的跃进计划而奋斗
    各位代表：去年和今年，我们在总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜下所取得的振奋人心的伟大成就，已经完全证明国内外的那些敌对分子，对于我们的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的恶意诽谤是毫无根据的，我们的前途充满着无限的光明。我们当前最主要的任务是要毫不动摇地继续贯彻总路线的精神，鼓足干劲，反对右倾保守思想和松劲情绪，深入展开轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动。我们要用新的大跃进的成就，来响应中共八届八中全会的号召，争取在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，争取大大提前超额完成十二年农业发展纲要，争取在十年左右的时间内，在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国。必须注意，右倾保守仍然是我们当前工作中的主要危险。我们必须坚决彻底地揭露、批判和克服右倾保守思想，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，贯彻执行社会主义建设的总路线。从实际的经验中，我们深刻地体会到气可鼓而不可泄，同样的客观条件，一鼓劲和一泄劲所产生的结果完全不同。大家都还记得，在去年七、八月的时候，就曾有过一部分保守思想作怪，当时很多经过群众讨论所规定的生产指标都有完不成的危险；但是去年八月的市人民代表大会前后，我们召开了一系列的群众动员大会，大家一鼓劲，各项计划指标终于都超额完成了。今年五、六月间，也有一部分人产生了右倾松劲情绪；而在反右倾思想、鼓干劲之后，生产的面貌立刻起了变化，产值天天上升。我们必须永远记取这个宝贵的经验，无论如何不要忘记！
    中国共产党八届八中全会向全国人民发出的开展增产节约运动的号召，应该成为我们当前一切工作的中心。在工业、农业、基本建设、商业以及其他各个战线上，都要努力增产、努力工作，开展社会主义的劳动竞赛。在工业方面，到今年年底，必须完成八十万吨生铁、三十六万吨钢、二十万吨钢材、六百三十五万吨原煤的生产任务，并要力争超额完成。基本建设方面要集中力量，保证主要项目，使更多的企业、事业和公共建筑迅速投入生产或交付使用，争取更快地发挥投资效果。在农业方面，没有受灾的地区要力争更大的丰收，以丰补歉；受灾地区要以生产救灾为中心，因地制宜地发展农、林、牧、副、渔各项生产，要抓紧秋收秋种、田间管理，特别要抓紧种麦工作，掀起一个种麦的群众高潮，争取明年更大的丰收。交通运输方面要合理地安排运输任务，挖掘运输潜力，提高运输效率，并且要大闹技术革命，解决短途运输和装卸工作这两个薄弱环节。商业工作要积极配合各个战线的增产节约运动，大力组织城乡生产资料和生活资料的供应，大力组织农产品、轻工业品和手工业品的收购。
    在厉行增产的同时，必须厉行节约。一面增产，一面节约，勤俭建国，勤俭办人民公社，勤俭办一切企业、事业，勤俭持家，这是我们国家的富强之道，也是我们完成和超额完成今年计划的重要关键。除了生产方面的节约以外，还要在全市人民中广泛进行节约的宣传教育工作。国家机关应该首先做模范，克勤克俭，节俭一切可以节减的开支。在城乡居民中提倡节约粮食、煤炭、电力和其他供应还不算富裕的消费品，提倡储蓄。我们不但要善于安排生产，而且要善于安排生活，会过日子，精打细算，留有后备。
    政治挂帅、贯彻群众路线是胜利地开展增产节约运动和超额地完成一九五九年计划指标的重要保证，也是我们做好一切工作所必须坚持的方针。一九五八年的大跃进和今年上半年的继续跃进，不但具体地显示了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的威力，也说明了我们的社会主义建设必须通过轰轰烈烈的群众运动来进行。
    我们应该时时刻刻记住毛主席给我们的教导。他说：“我们必须相信：（一）广大农民是愿意在党的领导下逐步地走上社会主义道路的；（二）党是能够领导农民走上社会主义道路的。这两点是事物的本质和主流。如果缺乏这种信心，我们就不可能在大约三个五年计划时期内基本上建成社会主义。”这是毛主席在四年以前说的话，今天我们还应该按照这一段话来检查我们自己，看看我们对于群众、对于党是否有这样饱满的信心？我们要永远坚持贯彻群众路线，把广大群众日益高涨的革命干劲充分地发挥出来。
    在全民整风运动和去年大跃进中所形成的定期召开群众会、五级干部会、大鸣大放大辩论的方法，以及干部参加劳动、种试验田、抓典型、学习业务、经常地联系基层群众等好方法，必须继续坚持下去，推动我们的工作不断地前进。
    各位代表：回顾过去，我们的成就是十分伟大的；展望将来，我们的前途是无限光明的。我们首都的工人、农民、革命知识分子和其他爱国的人民要更加紧密地团结起来，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，同心同德，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，力争超额完成今年的跃进计划，力争在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，力争在各个战线上创造新的大跃进的光辉成绩，来迎接我们中华人民共和国成立十周年的伟大节日。附图片）
