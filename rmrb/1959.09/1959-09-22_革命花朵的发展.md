Listening to the high-pitched, sonorous, gentle, and beautiful music of Longdong Daoqing in "Fengluo Pond," I immediately thought of the many small folk operas performed in Yan'an, northern Shaanxi, in those years. The famous song "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" developed some of its tunes from "Daoqing." These folk music pieces from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region once accompanied the vast number of revolutionary workers in their struggles and laughter, becoming comrades-in-arms to the revolutionary cadres and masses at the time, and the most powerful tool for mobilizing and inspiring the masses. Now, listening to these beautiful music pieces again, it is like reuniting with comrades who shared hardships on the revolutionary journey, feeling intimately close. Almost every melody is so captivating, and every sound is a precious word.

Originally, "Longdong Daoqing" was a type of shadow play music. Due to the neglect and destruction by the reactionary rulers of the old society, it had long been "shelved." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, some music workers re-collected and recorded its tunes, newly composing some small folk operas to serve the war effort. Until 1953, it was still only performed by amateur groups. Only at the beginning of this year was it officially transformed into a professional Daoqing opera troupe. I think that thanks to the wise leadership of the local Party organization, this art created by the local people has been given new life, opening up a broad road for it. At the same time, this art, which accompanied the revolution, made contributions, and suffered hardships, has been rejuvenated and will thrive alongside the revolution.

I don't want to say much about the script and performance of "Fengluo Pond." Although there are still many shortcomings, it is not easy for this troupe to have achieved such results after only being established for more than half a year.

However, the Daoqing music is of great musical value, especially the lyrical tunes. For example, in the scene "Feigned Marriage," Wu Feixia's singing "Wu Feixia Sits in a City of Sorrow," the section where Feixia and Du Ruoyi flee at night and Ruoyi is arrested, the solo and chorus in "Assassinating Liang" (with Ma Xing), and Ma Yaocao and Jian Rentong's betrothal: "Observing the Gentleman Sitting Quietly with a Candle"... etc., the music is infinitely affectionate, with a high degree of operatic music components, and the dramatic performance of the melody is very rich and unique.

Daoqing music also has a characteristic: it uses "backing vocals" (commonly known as "ma huang") in important parts of the plot to enhance the atmosphere.

The Daoqing opera orchestra has been greatly improved; the tones are accurate and beautiful, the pipa is used with great character, especially the flute, which makes the Daoqing music's mood melodious, and the northwest flavor is also expressed very prominently, blowing to make people soul-stirring.

The male roles' music, such as Ruoyi's singing "Filled with Indignation" when arrested in the "Night Escape" scene, and the passages sung when Feixia's father wakes up, also have a deep musical impact. However, some short songs lack musicality and expressive power. To be elevated to the level of "operatic music," it still needs to be developed.

    革命花朵的发展
    李凌
    听到“枫洛池”中那些高吭昂扬，委婉秀丽的陇东道情的音乐，立刻就连想起当年在陕北延安演的许多小调戏。那首有名的“兄妹开荒”，其中有些曲调，就是从“道情”发展出来的，这些陕甘宁边区的民间音乐，曾经陪同广大的革命工作者一起斗争一起欢笑，成为当时革命干部和群众的战友，成为当时动员群众和鼓舞群众的最有力的工具。而今再次聆听这些优美的音乐，正如同重逢革命程途中共过患难的同志一样亲切。几乎每一个旋律都是如此迷人，每一个音响都是宝贵的话语。
    本来，“陇东道情”是一种皮影戏的音乐，由于旧社会的反动统治者的漠视摧残，早已“投闲置散”了。在抗日战争中，一些音乐工作者重新收集、采记它的曲调，新编一些小调戏，为抗战服务，直到1953年还只有业余性的表演；今年初、才正式改为专业的道情剧团。我想，由于当地党组织的英明领导，把那些地方的老百姓所创造的艺术给以新的生命，为它开辟了一条宽广的道路，同时也把这些陪同革命的战士立过功劳、受过苦难的艺术重新焕发，和革命共长春。
    “枫洛池”的编剧和表演，我不想多说，虽然还有不少不足之处，但这个剧团刚成立半年多，有这样的成绩是不大容易的。
    而道情音乐，却是很有音乐价值，其中特别是抒情调，如“诳嫁”一场邬飞霞唱的“邬飞霞坐愁城”，飞霞和杜若义夜逃，若义被捕一段，“刺梁”中独唱和齐唱（与马兴），以及马瑶草与简仁同订终身：“观君子秉烛静坐”……等曲，音乐无限深情，带有极高的戏曲音乐成分，旋律的剧性表演非常丰富，而又别树一格。
    道情音乐，还有个特点，它们在剧情重要的地方。采用“帮腔”（俗称嘛簧），来增强气氛。
    道情戏的乐队，已经大大的改良了；音调准确而优美，琵琶应用得很有特色，特别是那支笛子，使道情音乐的情调悠扬，西北风味也表现得非常突出，吹来使人荡魂动魄。
    男角的音乐，如“夜逃”一场中若义被捕时所唱的“气冲牛斗”，飞霞父醒来时所唱的段落，音乐感染力也很深，可是还有一些简短的歌唱，音乐性不足，表情力也嫌薄弱。要提高到“戏曲音乐”的程度，还需要加以发展。
