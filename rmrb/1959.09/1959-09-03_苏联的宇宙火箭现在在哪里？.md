Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd. According to today's "Izvestia," although radio communication between the first Soviet space rocket and Earth has long ceased, the location of this solar satellite can still be calculated based on materials obtained after its launch.

After the space rocket was launched, it reached its perihelion on January 14th this year, at a distance of 146.4 million kilometers from the sun, at which time its speed was the greatest. On April 27th, the Earth overtook the space rocket, and at that time, the distance between the Earth and it was 18 million kilometers. Since then, the Earth has moved further and further away from it.

This Soviet solar satellite has now traveled half of its orbit around the sun. It has traveled more than 500 million kilometers since entering orbit and is currently at its aphelion, more than 197 million kilometers from the sun. Its current speed is 23.9 kilometers per second, and its distance from Earth is 120 million kilometers.

This rocket can approach the Earth relatively closely once every five years, and it will approach the Earth particularly closely in January of 1975, 2028, and 2044. At that time, the distance between the Earth and the rocket will still be several million kilometers. However, when they are relatively close, it may be possible to observe this small planet bearing the Soviet national emblem with astronomical instruments and photograph it.

    苏联的宇宙火箭现在在哪里？
    新华社莫斯科2日电　据今天的“消息报”报道；尽管苏联第一个宇宙火箭和地球上的无线电联系早已停止，但现在仍可以根据放射后获得的材料计算出这个太阳卫星的位置。
    宇宙火箭发射后，在今年1月14日它到达了近日点，离太阳一亿四千六百四十万公里，当时它的速度最大。4月27日地球赶过了这个宇宙火箭，那时地球和它的距离是一千八百万公里，此后地球赶过它越来越远。
    现在这颗苏联的太阳卫星已走了它绕太阳运转轨道的一半旅途。从它进入轨道起已经走了五亿多公里，而目前正处在远日点，离太阳一亿九千七百多万公里。现在它的速度是每秒二十三点九公里，与地球的距离是一亿二千万公里。
    这个火箭每经五年可以较近地接近地球一次，它接近地球特别近的时间将在1975、2028、2044年的1月份。那时，地球与火箭间的距离仍有几百万公里，不过，在相距较近时，可能用天文器械观察到这颗戴有苏联国徽的小行星，并可把它拍摄成照片。
