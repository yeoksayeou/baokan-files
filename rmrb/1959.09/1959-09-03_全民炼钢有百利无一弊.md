    Mass Steelmaking Has a Hundred Benefits and Not a Single Drawback
    Li Enjun, Engineer, Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant
    Mass steelmaking is a movement with a hundred benefits and not a single drawback. Take Tianjin's steel production as an example. Thanks to the mass steelmaking movement in 1958, it increased by more than 70,000 tons (excluding native steel), making it the fastest-growing year in recent years. This year, steel production will increase by 50% compared to last year. In the mass steelmaking movement, many things that seemed unimaginable in the past have become a reality. For example, in the past, our factory dared not use pig iron with a sulfur content exceeding 0.1. However, since the second half of last year, most of the pig iron we have used has been native iron produced by native blast furnaces and small blast furnaces in Zhangjiakou, Handan, Shijiazhuang, and other places. Its sulfur content is generally between 0.2 and 0.5. We not only used it to produce qualified steel, but also high-quality steel of many varieties such as steel wire rope steel, alloy steel, and spring steel. Now the qualified rate of our factory's steel ingots has reached more than 98%, of which more than 97% are the best grade of steel ingots. At present, the quality of the pig iron raw materials we use has been greatly improved, because the "small native groups" in Zhangjiakou, Handan, and other places that supply us with raw materials have gradually developed into "small foreign groups," so "high-sulfur native iron" has gradually been replaced by "foreign iron."
    In the Great Leap Forward, we learned and created many advanced experiences, which enabled our steel production technology to be rapidly improved. In the past year or so, eight workers from our factory alone have been promoted to engineers, and more veteran workers have been transferred to newly built steel plants to serve as furnace chiefs, technicians, and management cadres. We can not only guide production under normal circumstances, but also learned how to guide production under difficult conditions. If it weren't for the mass steelmaking last year, how could such a situation have arisen?!
    The communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have given our steel workers unlimited confidence and strength. We are determined, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, to go all out and, on the basis of the experience gained in the Great Leap Forward and mass steelmaking, to advance more courageously.

    全民炼钢有百利无一弊
    天津第一钢厂工程师  李恩俊
    全民炼钢是有百利而无一弊的运动。就以天津市的钢产量来说吧，经过1958年的全民炼钢运动就增加了七万多吨（土钢除外），是近几年来增长最快的一年。今年的钢产量又将比去年增长50％。在全民炼钢运动中，使许多过去看来不可想像的事情变成了现实。比如过去我厂炼钢时，生铁的含硫量超过了零点一就一概不敢使用。可是去年下半年以来，我们使用的生铁，绝大部分都是张家口、邯郸、石家庄等地的土高炉和小高炉生产的土铁，它的含硫量一般都在零点二到零点五左右。我们不仅用它炼成了合格钢，并且炼成了钢系绳钢、合金钢、弹簧钢等许多品种的优质钢，现在我们厂钢锭的合格率已达到98％以上，其中97％以上是钢锭中最好的一级品。目前我们使用的生铁原材料的质量已大为改善，这是因为供应我们原料的张家口、邯郸等地的“小土群”，已逐渐发展成“小洋群”，因此“高硫土铁”已逐渐被“洋铁”所代替了。
    在大跃进中，我们学习和创造了很多先进经验，使我们钢铁生产的技术水平得到迅速的提高。一年多以来，仅我们这个厂就有八名工人被提任了工程师，更多的老工人被抽调到新建的钢厂中担任炉长、技术员和管理干部。我们不仅能在正常的情况下指导生产，而且学会了在困难的条件下如何指导生产。要不是去年的全民炼钢，怎么会出现这样的局面呢？！
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议，给我们钢铁工人增加了无限的信心和力量，我们决心在党和毛主席的领导下，鼓足干劲，在大跃进和全民炼钢已取得经验的基础上，更加奋勇地前进。
