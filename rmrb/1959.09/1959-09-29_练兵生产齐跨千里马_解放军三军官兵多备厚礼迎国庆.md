Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: The People's Liberation Army’s land, sea, and air forces are advancing vigorously in all their work, using outstanding achievements to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

The various units engaged in military training are racing against each other, and their results are improving daily. One naval unit completed 26% of its annual training target in just over twenty days during the intense month of September. In an air force fighter unit, officers and soldiers eagerly offered suggestions and strategies, rapidly improving their tactical and technical level. In one exercise, they precisely achieved the goal of "attacking the enemy high in the sky and annihilating them when they come low." The armored units stationed in the Guangzhou area have been working hard in the scorching sun, striving to meet the standard of "being proficient in one skill and capable in many," with some battalions and companies becoming "all-round excellent" units. An artillery unit training on the grasslands completed the entire month's training tasks in twenty days, and many soldiers became excellent "all-around gunners." An engineer corps training team, in order to gain experience in crossing wide rivers, went to the banks of the Yangtze River for day and night practice. In a short period, 99% of them were able to swim continuously for three to four hours, crossing the Yangtze River using the breaststroke, sidestroke, and freestyle. Many engineering construction units achieved great victories in their construction tasks in August, and climbed to new heights in September. Some units completed their annual tasks a quarter ahead of schedule, with quality reaching first-class standards.

In supporting industrial and agricultural construction, tens of thousands of officers and soldiers are working with soaring enthusiasm, determined to dedicate new achievements to National Day. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit supporting the Kunming Iron and Steel Company put forward the inspiring slogan: "Complete the earthwork task for the steel rolling mill ahead of schedule to welcome National Day." In recent days, they have been vigorously carrying out technological innovations, and many companies are completing two days' worth of tasks in one day. The troops constructing the Ma (Manigango) Yu (Shu) Highway have encountered heavy rain almost every day, followed by scorching sun. The soldiers' clothes are wet and dry repeatedly, but they are in high spirits, smiling and saying: "Work hard during light rain, work harder during small rain, and work furiously when it doesn't rain." Their vow is: "Swamps, glaciers, and rushing rivers are cold, but wind and rain cannot stop heroes. We will complete the Ma-Yu Road in ten days and offer a gift for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation." The company where the "Five Warriors of Langya Mountain Squad" is stationed, is engaged in a labor competition with civilian workers at the Hetian Reservoir construction site in Guangzhou, creating a record of each person extracting five cubic meters of earth per day. Under the slogan of "Helping the people with the autumn harvest and welcoming National Day," troops in Shenyang, Beijing, and other regions have marched to the fields in large numbers to help people's communes rush to harvest autumn grain. The land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai recently dispatched more than two hundred vehicles and two thousand officers and soldiers to participate in local transportation work. They fought hard for seven days and seven nights, transporting more than 43,500 tons of supplies for the people to celebrate the holiday.

In mass activities to celebrate National Day, the troops are demonstrating their skills in all walks of life.

A certain factory in Wuhan completed the main targets of this year's annual plan one hundred and seventeen days ahead of schedule, and many workers created and modified many new types of tools through technological innovation. The automatic buttonhole machine successfully trial-produced by worker Zhang Pushan increased production efficiency by more than three times. In the motor transport troops, many motor vehicle companies completed their transport tasks more than ten days ahead of schedule. At the same time, the achievements of agricultural and sideline production in the troops are also rising steadily. Under the slogan of "Planting more fields to welcome National Day," a certain unit of the troops in the Guangzhou area has reclaimed more than 150 mu of wasteland in their spare time, planting peanuts, sweet potatoes, and other crops. The troops stationed on Dachen Island in Zhejiang have achieved a bumper harvest of non-staple foods, collecting more than one million jin of vegetables, raising more than 1,600 pigs, achieving complete self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables, and self-sufficiency in burning grass for nine months. Their determination is: "Offer a generous gift before the festival and have a good start after the festival."

    练兵生产齐跨千里马
    解放军三军官兵多备厚礼迎国庆
    据新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军陆、海、空三军各项工作齐头猛进，纷纷用优异成绩向建国十周年献礼。
    各个进行军事训练的部队，都在你追我赶，成绩日新月异。海军某部在大战9月里，二十多天完成了全年训练指标的26％。空军某歼击机部队，指战员争相献策献计，战术技术水平迅速提高，在一次演习中，精确地做到了“敌机”高来高打，低来低歼。驻广州地区的装甲兵部队，连日来冒着烈日高温，深钻苦练，基本达到“一专多能”的标准，有些营、连还成了“满堂红”单位。正在草原上练武的某炮兵部队，二十天完成了全月的训练任务，许多战士成了优秀的“全能炮手”。工程兵集训队为了取得横渡宽阔江河的经验，开赴长江沿岸，日夜练习，短时间内有99％的人能在水里连续游泳三至四小时，用蛙泳、侧泳、自由式三种姿式泅过长江。许多工程作业部队，8月份的施工任务大获全胜，9月份再登高峰，有的单位提前一个季度完成了全年的任务，质量达到一级标准。
    在支援工农业建设中，成千上万的官兵干劲冲天，决心以新成就献给国庆。支援昆明钢铁公司的某部官兵，斗志昂扬地提出：“提前完成轧钢厂土石方任务迎接国庆”的口号，连日来大闹技术革新，许多连队两天任务一天完成。正在修建马（马尼干戈）玉（树）公路的部队，这几天几乎天天都遇大雨，雨后又是烈日当头，战士们的衣服湿了又干，干了又湿，他们精神振奋，笑逐颜开地说：大雨小干，小雨大干，不下雨发狠干。他们的誓言是：沼泽冰河急水寒，风雨难挡英雄汉，十天修通马玉路，建国十年把礼献。“狼牙山五壮士班”所在的连队，在广州鹤地水库工地上，与民工发起了劳动竞赛，创造出每人每天取土五立方的最高纪录。沈阳、北京等地区部队在“助民秋收，迎接国庆”的口号下，浩浩荡荡开赴农田，帮助人民公社抢收秋粮。驻上海的陆海空三军，最近还派出二百多辆汽车，两千多名官兵参加当地运输工作，他们奋战了七天七夜，运出了四万三千五百多吨供人民过节的物资。
    在群众性的向国庆献礼活动中，部队各行各业都大显身手。
    武汉某厂提前一百一十七天，完成了今年年度计划的主要指标，许多工人在技术革新中创造和改制出许多新式工具。工人张普善试制成功的自动化扣兜机，提高生产效率三倍以上。在汽车运输部队里，许多汽车连提前十多天完成了运输任务。在这同时，各部队农副业生产的成绩，也在节节上升。广州地区部队某部，在“多种田，迎国庆”的口号下，利用业余时间开荒一百五十多亩，种下花生、地瓜等农作物。驻浙江大陈岛的部队，获得副食品大丰收，收到蔬菜一百多万斤，养猪一千六百多头，作到肉菜全部自给，烧草九个月自给。他们的决心是：节前献大礼，节后开门红。
