Great Leap Forward in Pest Control
Chen Shixiang, Director of the Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

I wholeheartedly support the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. In 1958, China made great achievements on the economic and cultural fronts, achieving an unprecedented great leap forward. I am an entomologist. Let me illustrate this with the leap forward facts on the pest control front.

First, since liberation, China's pest control work has developed from past sporadic and localized control to large-scale and comprehensive control. The progress in 1958 was particularly rapid, forming a large-scale pest control effort. In 1958, the area of agricultural pest and disease control nationwide leaped from 700 million mu in 1957 to over 1.8 billion mu. More than 700 counties and cities eliminated one or several major pests and diseases. China's most serious rice stem borer has been basically eradicated in 173 counties and cities in 14 provinces. This great achievement is inseparable from the establishment of people's communes. Only under the commune system can such a rapid leap forward be achieved.

Second, pest forecasting work has been established in recent years. This work has shifted our pest control from passive to active. In 1956, there were 113 national forecasting stations, which increased to 200 in 1957, and leaped to 678 in 1958. There were also more than 13,000 insect situation reporting points. This development continued in 1959, with forecasting points and insect reporting points extending to people's communes and production brigades. A large-scale national insect situation network has been formed. The study of pest occurrence patterns has also made great progress in recent years. By mastering a large amount of scientific data, we have now formulated prediction and forecasting methods for 32 important agricultural crop pests.

Third, there has been great progress in insecticides and machinery. The supply of pesticides and machinery from 1952 to 1957 totaled more than 400,000 tons of various pesticides and more than 3 million machines. In 1958 alone, the quantity of pesticides and machinery supplied exceeded the total of the previous six years. The manufacture of "foreign drugs" saw the successful trial production of insecticides such as Aldrin, Chlordane, Malathion, Thiodan, etc. in 1958. These were all successfully made in a very short period of time under the ideology of daring to think and daring to act. Under the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," the masses across the country vigorously engaged in the movement of indigenous pesticides in 1958, producing more than 500 kinds of indigenous pesticides. They explored a lot of experience in the collection, manufacture, use, and storage of indigenous pesticides, and created many compound mixed agents with high insecticidal effects.

Fourth, summary works such as "Chinese Indigenous Pesticide Records," "First Collection of the Chinese Crop Pest and Disease Atlas," "First Collection of the Chinese Forest Pest Atlas," and "Chinese Economic Insect Records Cerambycidae" were all completed in a very short time through collective collaboration, promoting the spirit of collectivism.

Fifth, the scientific mass line made great leaps forward in 1958. Under the policy of combining theory with practice and facing the masses, entomological work not only received the support of the broad masses but also saw the emergence of many creations and inventions among the masses. For example, Li Shimei's research on termite control, Wang Zhihai's research on rice planthoppers, and the achievements of the masses in the vigorous movement of indigenous pesticides have all played a significant role in production.

From the above examples, it can be seen that China's entomology, like other sciences, is advancing rapidly by leaps and bounds under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the brilliant illumination of the general line. All of us entomologists across the country will respond enthusiastically to the great call of the Party Central Committee with firm confidence and soaring enthusiasm, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 grain and cotton leap forward targets!

    害虫防治工作在大跃进
    中国科学院昆虫研究所所长　陈世骧
    我衷心拥护八届八中全会的公报和决议。1958年我国在经济战线和文化战线上作出了伟大的成就，实现了史无前例的巨大跃进。我是一个昆虫学工作者。让我就害虫防治战线上的跃进事实来作一说明。
    第一，解放以来，我国的害虫防治工作已由过去的点片、局部的防治，发展到大面积的全面防治，1958年的进展尤其迅速，形成大规模防治害虫工作。1958年，全国农业病虫害的防治面积已由1957年的七亿亩跃进到十八亿多亩，消灭一种或几种主要病虫害的县、市达七百多个，我国最严重的水稻螟害，已在十四个省区的一百七十三个县、市内得到基本扑灭。这个巨大的成就是和人民公社的建立分不开的，只有在公社的制度下，才能实现这样迅速的跃进。
    第二，害虫预测工作是最近几年内建立起来的。这个工作使我们的害虫防治由被动转向主动。1956年全国预测预报站共有一百一十三个，1957年增加到二百个，1958年则跃进到六百七十八个，并设有虫情报告点一万三千多个，1959年更为发展，预报点和虫情点深入到人民公社和生产大队，一个规模宏大的全国虫情网已经组成。害虫发生规律的研究，近年来也有很大进展，由于掌握了大量科学资料，我们现已对三十二种重要农作物害虫制订出预测预报的办法。
    第三，杀虫药械有很大的进展。药械供应量在1952年到1957年共供应各种农药四十多万吨，器械三百多万架，而在1958年一年内所供应的农药和器械数量超过以往六年的总和。“洋药”制造，1958年试制成功的杀虫剂有艾氏剂、氯丹、马拉松、西多特等等。都是在敢想敢做的思想下，在极短时期内做成功的。在“土洋并举”的方针下，1958年全国各地群众大搞土农药运动，生产土农药五百多种，在土农药的采集、制造、使用、贮存等方面，摸索出不少经验，并创造了许多复方配制的混合剂，杀虫效果很高。
    第四，“中国土农药志”、“中国农作物病虫图谱第一集”、“中国森林害虫图志第一辑”、“中国经济昆虫志天牛科”等总结性著作，都是通过集体协作的方式，发扬集体主义精神，在极短时间内完成的。
    第五，科学的群众路线在1958年内得到了很大跃进，在结合实际、面向群众的方针下，昆虫学工作不仅得到了广大群众的支持，并在群众中涌现出不少创造和发明。例如李始美关于防治白蚁的研究，王治海关于稻风虱的研究，以及各地群众在大搞土农药运动中的成就，在生产上都起着很大作用。
    从以上几个例子，可以看到我国昆虫学和其他科学一样，在中国共产党的正确领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，正在大踏步地迅速前进。我们全国昆虫学工作者，都将以坚定的信心，冲天的干劲，热烈响应党中央的伟大号召，为完成并超额完成1959年的粮棉跃进指标而努力！
