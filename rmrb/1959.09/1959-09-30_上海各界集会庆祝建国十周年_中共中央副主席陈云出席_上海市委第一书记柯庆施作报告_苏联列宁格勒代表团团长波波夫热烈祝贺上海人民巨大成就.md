Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 29th. Shanghai held a grand rally this afternoon at the Cultural Square to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. More than 9,000 representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai attended the meeting.

Chen Yun, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, who is currently in Shanghai, attended the meeting.

Also attending today's meeting was the Soviet Leningrad delegation, led by Popov, Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the CPSU, who are visiting Shanghai at the invitation of the Chinese government.

Also invited to attend the meeting were consular personnel stationed in Shanghai and foreign guests in Shanghai.

The magnificent venue was decorated with lanterns and streamers, shining brightly. Many flowers were placed on the rostrum, making it particularly solemn and beautiful. People were elated and filled with joy, and the entire venue was filled with an atmosphere of joy, friendship, and unity.

At 3:00 p.m., the meeting was declared open in the solemn national anthem. Then, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Mayor of Shanghai, delivered a long speech. He spoke in detail about the changes in Shanghai over the past ten years, especially the great achievements made since the Great Leap Forward last year. He said: Like the rest of the country, Shanghai has undergone a series of profound changes in the economic, political, and ideological fronts over the past ten years. The socialist transformation has been basically completed, and the socialist relations of production have been established and are being consolidated and improved. The significant changes in the relations of production have opened up avenues for the development of social productive forces. Shanghai's modern industry has a history of 107 years by the time of liberation in 1949, but the total industrial output value for the entire year of 1949 was only 3.99 billion yuan. After the first Five-Year Plan period after liberation, by 1957, Shanghai's industrial output value increased by 268.5% compared to 1949. In 1958, inspired by the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the Shanghai working class was more fully demonstrated. In that year, Shanghai's industrial output value soared to 17.13 billion yuan, equivalent to 553.5% of 1949. In 1959, we are striving to reach a total industrial output value of 24 billion yuan, which is close to eight times the output value of Shanghai in the year of liberation. At the beginning of 1958, the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress suggested that Shanghai's total industrial output value should be increased to 22.8 billion yuan during the second Five-Year Plan period. Now it seems that this task can be completed ahead of schedule this year.

Ke Qingshi said: Shanghai's industrial structure has also undergone significant changes. Before liberation, the main part of Shanghai's industry was light textile industry, with very little heavy industry, capable only of repair and maintenance. Over the past ten years, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, eleven new industrial areas, including Yunzaobang, Pengpu, Taopu, Beixinjing, Caohejing, Wujing, and Minhang, have been newly built and expanded, greatly changing the incomplete state of Shanghai's industry. In 1949, heavy industry accounted for 13.6%, general light industry accounted for 24%, and the textile industry accounted for 62.4%. In 1958, the proportion of heavy industry rose to 45.6%. This change has greatly strengthened the role of Shanghai's industrial base. On the basis of the priority development of heavy industry, the light textile industry, which already had a good foundation, is also developing rapidly. General light industry has increased fourfold compared to 1949, and the textile industry has increased by 1.9 times. Shanghai's technical level is also rapidly improving. Now, it can not only produce a large amount of technical equipment and consumer goods for the country and the people, but also produce many high-end, precision, large-scale, and cutting-edge products. Shanghai has developed into a powerful comprehensive industrial base.

Ke Qingshi said: This great change in Shanghai's industry is closely related to the great changes in the whole country. The development of Shanghai's industry has provided the country with more products, accumulated more construction funds for the country, and cultivated a large number of technical personnel for the country. Over the past ten years, Shanghai has trained a total of 490,000 young apprentices, including 124,000 trained for other regions. 1.5 million laborers have been transferred to other regions, including more than 200,000 skilled workers and various specialized talents. This has strongly supported the country's industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings.

He said: After the realization of the people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai, various undertakings have developed particularly rapidly. In the not-too-distant future, the suburbs may realize mechanization and electrification. Commerce, transportation, and cultural and educational undertakings have also developed greatly over the past ten years, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958. There are now a total of 2.06 million primary and secondary school students in the city, an increase of two and a half times compared to 1949. Now, one out of every five residents in the city's population of ten million is a student.

Ke Qingshi said: The entire appearance of Shanghai has greatly changed in the ten years since liberation. Among all the changes, the most valuable is the change in people's mental outlook. The influence of the old ideas and old habits left over from the old era of exploiting classes and exploiting systems is gradually shrinking, and the socialist mutual assistance and cooperation between comrades has gradually become the new customs and new habits of our new Shanghai.

Ke Qingshi then said that all these victories and achievements were created by the people of Shanghai under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. These achievements cannot be denied by anyone. He said: When Shanghai was first liberated, the American imperialism and its echoers once asserted that "the Communist Party can only engage in politics and military affairs, but cannot manage the economy, and cannot manage a big city like Shanghai," and also said that "Shanghai is a big dye vat, the Communist Party enters red and exits black." Now, the facts have proven that we can not only manage Shanghai, this big city, but also manage it many times better than any imperialist and all reactionaries. Our Communist Party has not only not exited black, but has continued to maintain its revolutionary character, and has transformed the entire Shanghai into a red revolutionary city. The old Shanghai, the "paradise of adventurers," is long gone.

Ke Qingshi emphasized that our victories in the past ten years are extremely great. This is the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China, the victory of the Party's general line for socialist revolution, the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party in carrying out a vigorous revolutionary mass movement. He concluded by saying: Under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong and the glorious light of the general line, we will surely be able to go all out, aim high, and build a new socialist Shanghai and build our powerful socialist motherland in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

Amidst thunderous applause, Popov, head of the Soviet Leningrad delegation and Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the CPSU, delivered a congratulatory speech to the meeting. He first extended his heartfelt congratulations to the fraternal people of Shanghai on behalf of the Party and working people of Leningrad. He said: Both Shanghai and Leningrad have made great contributions to the revolution and construction of their respective countries, therefore, the two cities must strengthen friendly ties and exchange construction experiences. We are proud that many factories, enterprises, and scientific research institutes in Leningrad are manufacturing orders for the People's Republic of China, preparing and providing various equipment, machines, instruments, and other technical data; Chinese children are studying and improving their professional skills in our universities and scientific research institutes. There are also eighteen Leningrad experts working in various enterprises and institutions in Shanghai.

He said that the people of Leningrad will do everything possible to fulfill the glorious task put forward by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the people of Leningrad to support our fraternal Chinese people. After Popov's speech, he read out the congratulatory letter from the Leningrad Oblast Committee and the Leningrad City Committee of the CPSU, the Executive Committee of the Leningrad Oblast Soviet of Workers' Deputies, and the Executive Committee of the Leningrad City Soviet of Workers' Deputies to the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee. Finally, Popov, on behalf of the working people of Leningrad, presented the commemorative medal and commemorative vase of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Leningrad to the working people of Shanghai. When he handed these precious gifts to Ke Qingshi, everyone stood up and applauded warmly for a long time.

Subsequently, representatives of Shanghai's various people's organizations, democratic parties, and people from all walks of life, Guo Jian, Zhao Zukang, Li Landing, Li Fuxiang, and Gu Busheng, delivered speeches successively. They warmly hailed the great achievements made by Shanghai under the leadership of the Party over the past ten years, and hailed the great victories achieved since last year in the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the people's communes, and the ideological transformation of intellectuals, inspired by the Party's General Line for socialist construction. They unanimously expressed that they must hold higher the banner of victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, further go all out, aim high, and throw themselves into the vigorous new upsurge of the increase production and practice economy movement, and make better contributions in the great struggle to complete and overfulfill the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 29th. The Soviet Leningrad delegation, which was invited to visit Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai by plane yesterday afternoon from Beijing, led by Popov, the head of the delegation and Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the CPSU.

    上海各界集会庆祝建国十周年
    中共中央副主席陈云出席　上海市委第一书记柯庆施作报告
    苏联列宁格勒代表团团长波波夫热烈祝贺上海人民巨大成就
    新华社上海29日电　上海市人民庆祝建国十周年大会今天下午在文化广场隆重举行。参加大会的有上海市各界代表九千多人。
    正在上海的中共中央副主席、国务院副总理陈云参加了大会。
    出席今天大会的，还有应邀来上海访问的、以苏共列宁格勒市委书记波波夫为首的苏联列宁格勒代表团。
    应邀参加大会的还有各国驻上海的领事人员和在上海的外宾。
    宏伟的大会会场上悬灯结彩，光辉夺目。主席台上摆着许多鲜花，显得格外庄严美丽。人们兴高采烈，喜气洋洋，整个会场充满了欢乐、友爱、团结的气氛。
    下午三时，大会在庄严的国歌声中宣布开幕。接着，中共上海市委第一书记、上海市市长柯庆施作了长篇讲话。他详细谈到了上海十年来的变化，特别是去年大跃进以来所取得的巨大成就。他说：上海如同全国一样，十年来在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上都发生了一系列的深刻变化。社会主义改造已经基本完成，社会主义生产关系已经建立并日益巩固和完善起来。生产关系的重大变化，为社会生产力的发展开辟了道路。上海的现代工业，到1949年解放时，已有一百零七年的历史，但是1949年全年工业总产值只有三十九亿九千万元。解放后经过第一个五年计划时期，到1957年上海工业产值比1949年增加了268.5％。1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，上海工人阶级的革命首倡精神更加充分地表现出来，这一年上海工业产值飞升到一百七十一亿三千万元，相当于1949年的553.5％。1959年我们正在力争使工业总产值达到二百四十亿元，接近解放那一年八个上海的产值。1958年初，上海市的党员代表大会曾经建议：在第二个五年计划期间使上海工业总产值增加到二百二十八亿元，现在看来，这个任务今年就可以提前超额完成。
    柯庆施说：上海的工业结构也发生了重大变化，解放前上海工业的主要部分是轻纺工业，重工业很少，只能修修补补。十年来，特别是经过1958年的大跃进，新建和扩建了蕴藻浜、彭浦、桃浦、北新泾、漕河泾、吴泾、闵行等十一个新工业区，使上海工业残缺不全的状况有了很大改变。1949年，重工业占13.6％，一般轻工业占24％，纺织工业占62.4％，1958年重工业比重上升为45.6％。这个变化使上海工业基地的作用大大加强了。在重工业优先发展的基础上，本来基础较好的轻纺工业也在迅速发展。一般轻工业比1949年增加四倍，纺织工业增加了一点九倍。上海的技术水平也在迅速提高。现在不但能够为国家和人民生产大量的技术装备和消费品，而且能够生产不少高级、精密、大型、尖端的产品。上海已经发展成为一个强大的综合性的工业基地。
    柯庆施说：上海工业的这个大变化，是同全国的大变化密切联系的。上海工业的发展为国家提供了更多的产品、为国家积累了更多的建设资金，并且为国家培养了大批技术力量。十年来，上海培养的青工艺徒共有四十九万人，其中为外地培养的有十二万四千人。调往外地的劳动力有一百五十万人，其中技术工人和各种专门人材共有二十多万人。有力地支援了全国的工农业生产和各项建设事业。
    他说：上海郊区实现人民公社化后，各项事业发展特别迅速。在不要很远的将来，郊区就可能实现机械化、电力化。商业、交通运输事业和文化教育事业，十年来，特别是经过1958年的大跃进，也都有很大发展。现在全市大、中、小学生共二百零六万人，比1949年增加两倍半。现在全市一千万人口中，每五个居民就有一个是学生。
    柯庆施说：上海解放十年来，整个面貌已经大大改观。在各种变化中最值得珍贵的是人们精神面貌的变化。旧时代的剥削阶级和剥削制度遗留下的旧思想、旧习惯的影响正在逐渐缩小，社会主义的同志间的互助合作关系，逐渐成了我们新上海的新风俗、新习惯。
    柯庆施接着说，所有这些胜利和成就，都是上海人民在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下创造出来的。这些成就是任何人也否认不了的。他说：上海刚解放的时候，美帝国主义和它的应声虫曾经断言“共产党只会搞政治、搞军事，就是管不了经济，管不了上海这样的大城市”，又说“上海是个大染缸，共产党红着进来黑着出去”。现在事实已经证明，我们不但管得了上海这个大城市，而且比任何帝国主义者和一切反动派管理得不知要好多少倍，我们共产党不但没有黑着出去，不但继续保持着革命的本色，而且把整个上海变成了红色的革命城市。“冒险家的乐园”的旧上海早已一去不复返了。
    柯庆施强调指出，我们十年来的胜利极其伟大。这是马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利，这是党的社会主义革命总路线的胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是中国人民在党的领导下开展轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动的胜利。他最后说：在党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲的号召下，在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，我们一定能够鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的新上海，建设我们强大的社会主义祖国。
    苏联列宁格勒代表团团长、苏共列宁格勒市委书记波波夫在雷动的掌声中向大会致贺词。他首先代表列宁格勒的党和劳动人民，向兄弟般的上海人民致衷心的祝贺。他说：上海和列宁格勒都在自己祖国的革命和建设中作了巨大的贡献，因此这两个城市一定要加强友好联系，相互交流建设经验。我们感到骄傲的是：列宁勒格有许多工厂、企业和科学研究所，正在为中华人民共和国制造订货，准备和提供各种设备、机器、仪器等技术资料；中国的儿女正在我们的高等学校和科学研究所里学习和提高自己的业务水平。在上海的各个企业和机构里也有十八个列宁格勒专家在进行工作。
    他说，我们列宁格勒人民将尽一切力量完成苏联共产党向列宁格勒人民提出的支援我们兄弟般的中国人民的光荣任务。波波夫致词以后，接着宣读了苏共列宁格勒州委会和列宁格勒市委会、列宁格勒州劳动者代表苏维埃执行委员会和列宁格勒市劳动者代表苏维埃执行委员会给中共上海市委会和上海市人民委员会的祝贺信。最后波波夫代表列宁格勒劳动人民把列宁格勒建城二百五十周年纪念章和纪念花瓶，赠给上海市劳动人民。当他把这些珍贵的礼品交给柯庆施的时候，全体起立，报以长时间的热烈掌声。
    接着，上海市各人民团体、各民主党派和各界人民的代表郭建、赵祖康、李蓝丁、李福祥、顾步生相继讲话，他们热烈欢呼上海市十年来在党领导下所取得的伟大成就，欢呼去年以来在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，工农业生产大跃进、人民公社化和知识分子思想改造等方面所取得的辉煌胜利。他们一致表示一定要更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社化的胜利旗帜，进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，投入轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动新高潮，在今年内完成和超额完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大斗争中，更好地作出贡献。
    新华社上海29日电　应邀来上海访问的苏联列宁格勒代表团，在团长、苏共列宁格勒市委书记波波夫率领下，昨天下午由北京乘飞机到达上海。
    前往机场欢迎的有中共上海市委书记处书记马天水，中共上海市委书记处候补书记、上海市中苏友好协会副会长石西民，上海市人民委员会秘书长曾涛等。
