Comrade Zvi Breitstein, Chairman of the Central Auditing Commission of the Communist Party of Israel and Representative of the Communist Party of Israel, delivered a congratulatory message:

    I am very happy to celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with you. I am very honored to convey to you, and through you to the great and heroic Chinese people, the sincere and fraternal congratulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Israel and the progressive working people of our country who love peace and freedom.
    I now read the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Israel:
      Congratulatory Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Israel
    Dear Comrades:
    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we extend our warm and heartfelt fraternal congratulations to you, and through you to the great Chinese people.
    The great victory of the people's revolution ten years ago over the combined forces of domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialism made the Chinese people with a long history masters of their own country's destiny. Under the wise leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party and its great and beloved leader Comrade Mao Zedong, your country has transformed from a backward and weak nation into an advanced and powerful one. Its importance on the international stage is constantly growing. Thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, thanks to the tireless labor of the heroic liberated Chinese proletariat and all Chinese working people, your great country has become a shining example for the oppressed peoples of all countries who are fighting for peace, freedom, and prosperity over the past ten years.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China will be recorded in history as a major international event, which has changed the balance of power between capitalism and socialism in the world in favor of socialism. This event marks a new stage and has become a source of rich experience, inspiration, and encouragement for the people of all continents in their national liberation struggle to break free from the shackles of imperialist oppressors.
    You have successfully eliminated feudalism in China, carried out extensive and in-depth land reform, and continuously improved the material and cultural standards of the masses of workers, peasants, and working intellectuals. This victory proves to all people who love peace and socialism that a conclusion of Marxism-Leninism is definitely correct, that is: the revolutionary alliance of the working class and laboring peasants led by the working class under the guidance of the Communist Party will bring complete national and social liberation to the laboring masses who have been exploited and oppressed for generations, and will bring large-scale and comprehensive development to the motherland.
    People's China plays a respected role in the struggle of people all over the world for peace, freedom, and independence—it once gave significant assistance to the heroic Korean people in their struggle to drive the US imperialist aggressors out of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, made a great contribution to the success of the historic Bandung Conference of Asian and African Peoples, and played a major role in stopping the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against the Egyptian people in 1956 and in preventing the attempt to strangle the Republic of Iraq in the early days after the historic victory of the Iraqi people over the bloodstained, pro-imperialist regime of Nuri al-Said, the butcher who slaughtered the Iraqi people.
    Due to the great achievements of the People's Republic of China, due to its unwavering fraternal great unity with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, and because it is an integral part of the powerful world socialist camp headed by communist builders and people who launch cosmic rockets to the moon, the People's Republic of China is at the forefront of the working people of the world advancing towards communism!
    No force in the world can forever prevent the great Chinese people from obtaining their legitimate position in the United Nations, or from liberating Taiwan from the rule of the bloody butcher who murdered the Chinese people, the traitor, the despicable servant of US imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek.
    The historic victory of People's China has greatly encouraged our patriotic and internationalist political struggle at home for a fundamental change in Israeli policy, which is: to change the policy of threatening and using force to a policy of peace and consultation; to change the policy of relying on imperialists to a policy of national independence; to change from a policy of national oppression against Arab residents in Israel and non-recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian Arab people to a policy of guaranteeing the civil and national rights of our Arab residents and recognizing the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian Arab people; to change from a policy of hostility towards the national liberation movements of the people of neighboring Arab countries to a policy of firmly supporting the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of the Near East and Middle East. Our party mobilizes the Israeli masses, peace and democracy fighters, to demand that the Israeli government support the right of the People's Republic of China to restore its seat in the United Nations and to adopt a friendly policy towards People's China, the Soviet Union, and all socialist countries.
    We deeply admire and are proud of the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of your Party Central Committee, and we sincerely wish you further achievements in peaceful socialist construction; your socialist construction is an important and powerful cornerstone of the great edifice of the world socialist camp, which is the invincible fortress of peace, democracy, and socialism, led by the Soviet Union.
    Long live the People's Republic of China, may it prosper!
    Glory and praise to the great Chinese people and its heroic Communist Party!
    Long live the ever-stronger world socialist camp!
    Long live peace!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!
    Long live communism!
                      General Secretary She. Mikunis (signed)
                                  Representing the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Israel
                                     September 23, 1959 (attached picture)

    以色列共产党中央监察委员会主席、以色列共产党代表
    兹维·布莱斯坦同志的贺词
    我非常高兴来同你们一起庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的伟大国庆。我很高兴的能够荣幸地向你们、并且通过你们向伟大英勇的中国人民转达以色列共产党中央委员会和我国热爱和平和自由的进步劳动人民的热诚的兄弟般的祝贺。
    我现在宣读以色列中央委员会的贺信：
      以色列共产党中央委员会的贺信亲爱的同志们：
    值此中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，我们向你们、并且通过你们向伟大的中国人民致以热烈的、最衷心的兄弟的祝贺。
    人民革命在十年前对国内反动派和外国帝国主义的联合力量所取得的伟大胜利，使得有悠久历史的中国人民成了自己国家的命运的主人。在英雄的中国共产党及其伟大的受到爱戴的领袖毛泽东同志的英明领导下，你们的国家已经从一个落后衰弱的国家变成一个先进强大的国家。它在国际舞台上的重要性正在不断增长。由于中国共产党的领导，由于英勇的解放了的中国无产阶级和中国全体劳动者的不倦的劳动，你们伟大的国家这十年来已经成为正在为和平、自由和繁荣而斗争的各国受压迫人民的光辉榜样。
    中华人民共和国的成立将作为一个重大的国际事件载入史册，它使世界上资本主义和社会主义之间的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义的变化。这一事件标志着一个新的阶段，并且已经成为各大洲的人民在争取摆脱帝国主义压迫者的枷锁的民族解放斗争中吸取丰富经验、得到振奋和鼓舞的源泉。
    你们成功地消灭了中国的封建制度，进行了广泛而深入的土地改革，不断提高工人、农民和劳动知识分子群众的物质和文化水平。这一胜利向所有爱好和平和社会主义的人民证明马克思列宁主义的一个结论是肯定正确的，那就是：在共产党引导下的工人阶级所领导的工人阶级和劳动农民的革命联盟，会给世世代代备受剥削和压迫的劳动群众带来完全的民族解放和社会解放，会给祖国带来大规模的全面的发展。
    人民中国在全世界各国人民争取和平、自由和独立的斗争中起了受人尊敬的作用——它曾经给英雄的朝鲜人民把美帝国主义侵略者赶出朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的斗争以重大的援助，对具有历史意义的亚非人民万隆会议的成功作出了巨大贡献，在制止1956年法英以三国对埃及人民的侵略方面、在制止企图在伊拉克共和国对屠杀伊拉克人民的刽子手努里·赛义德的沾满鲜血的亲帝国主义政权取得具有历史意义的胜利之后的最初日子里，扼杀伊拉克共和国的侵略方面作出了重大贡献。
    由于中华人民共和国的巨大成就，由于它同苏联以及所有社会主义国家的不可动摇的兄弟般的伟大团结，由于它是以共产主义建设者们和向月球发射宇宙火箭的人们为首的强大的世界社会主义阵营不可分割的一部分，中华人民共和国走在向共产主义前进的全世界劳动人民的前列！
    世界上没有任何力量能够永远阻挠伟大的中国人民取得他们在联合国中的合法地位，阻挠伟大的中国人民把台湾从杀害中国人民的血腥刽子手、卖国贼、美帝国主义的可鄙的奴仆蒋介石的统治下解放出来。
    人民中国的具有历史意义的胜利大大鼓舞了我们在国内进行的争取从根本上改变以色列政策的爱国的、国际主义的政治斗争，这种改变就是：把武力威胁和使用武力的政策变为和平和协商的政策；把依靠帝国主义者的政策变为民族独立的政策；从对以色列境内的阿拉伯居民实行民族压迫和不承认巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民正当的民族权利的政策变为保障我国阿拉伯居民的公民权利和民族权利和承认巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民正当的民族权利的政策；把敌视邻近的阿拉伯国家人民的民族解放运动的政策变为坚定地支持近东和中东各国人民的反帝国主义的斗争的政策。我们的党动员以色列的人民群众、和平和民主战士，要求以色列政府支持中华人民共和国恢复在联合国组织内的席位的权利，要求对人民中国、苏联和所有社会主义国家采取友好的政策。
    我们对于中国人民在你们党中央委员会的英明的领导下取得的巨大成就十分钦佩，而且引以自豪，我们由衷地祝你们在和平的社会主义建设中获得进一步的成就；你们的社会主义建设是和平、民主和社会主义的不可战胜的堡垒——以苏联为首的世界社会主义阵营——这一巨大建筑物的重要的、强有力的基石。
    中华人民共和国万岁，繁荣！
    光荣和赞美归于伟大的中国人民和它的英雄的共产党！
    日益强大的世界社会主义阵营万岁！
    和平万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党万岁！
    共产主义万岁！
                      总书记舍·米库尼斯（签字）
                                  代表以色列共产党中央委员会
                                     1959年9月23日（附图片）
