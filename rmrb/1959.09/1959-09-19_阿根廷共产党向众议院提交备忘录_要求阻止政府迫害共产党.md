Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 16th. Argentine Communist Party parliamentarians today submitted a memorandum to the Presidium of the House of Representatives, condemning the government's conspiracy to ban the Communist Party from participating in next year's parliamentary elections.

The memorandum stated that the government's purpose in doing so "is to engage in fraudulent activities in the elections, which completely undermines the democratic, republican, and representative system of the Argentine Constitution." The memorandum emphasized that the plan to outlaw the Communist Party is directly aimed at the entire democracy of Argentina, because "in the history of our political life over the past thirty years, the legality or illegality of our party has been considered linked to the legality or illegality of the entire democracy." Now all major political parties have issued statements opposing the persecution of the Communist Party.

The memorandum then pointed out, "There is no need to avoid saying that such actions of persecuting the Communist Party, persecuting the working class, and persecuting the people are the demands of international capitalism, primarily American imperialism: the coercive means of the International Monetary Fund are very familiar to our people. Therefore, the government's various accusations against the Communist Party that it is acting in accordance with 'international orders' are futile; only those who serve foreign countries to deal with the people and the country are subject to the demands of imperialism." The memorandum pointed out, "By implementing such unconstitutional persecution measures, the government is placing itself, not the Communist Party, in an illegal position." The memorandum demanded that the government's request to ban the Communist Party be rejected when it is submitted to the parliament; demanded that the parliament guarantee democratic rights; and believed that any anti-democratic laws should be repealed, first and foremost martial law.

    阿根廷共产党向众议院提交备忘录
    要求阻止政府迫害共产党
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯16日电  阿根廷共产党议员今天交给众议院主席团一份备忘录，谴责政府阴谋禁止共产党参加明年议会选举。
    备忘录说，政府要这样做的目的“是在选举中搞欺诈活动，这种行动完全破坏了阿根廷宪法的民主共和代议制”。备忘录着重指出，宣布共产党非法的计划是直接针对阿根廷的整个民主的，因为“在我们过去三十年的政治生活史中，我们党的合法或非法是被认为同整个民主的合法或非法联在一起的”。现在各大政党都发表了声明反对迫害共产党。
    备忘录接着指出，“无庸讳言，迫害共产党、迫害工人阶级、迫害人民的这种行动是国际资本主义，首先是美国帝国主义的要求：国际货币基金组织的强迫手段是我国人民十分熟悉的。因此政府对共产党的所谓它遵照“国际命令”行事的种种指责都是徒劳的；只有为外国服务来对付人民和国家的人才是服从于帝国主义的要求的。”备忘录指出，“由于实行这种违反宪法的迫害措施，政府使自己，而不是使共产党处于不法地位。”备忘录要求在政府向议会提出禁止共产党的要求时予以拒绝；要求议会保障民主权利；认为应当撤销任何反民主的法律，首先是戒严法。
