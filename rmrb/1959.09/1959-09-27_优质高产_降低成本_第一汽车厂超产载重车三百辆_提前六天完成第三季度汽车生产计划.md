Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 26th: The employees of the First Automobile Works have overfulfilled the September and third-quarter automobile production plans, achieving the goal of presenting a gift to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation ahead of schedule.

By the 24th of September, a total of 1,802 trucks had been assembled, exceeding the monthly plan by 202 vehicles. In these twenty-four days, eleven days reached a shift production of more than 100 vehicles, and the shift production on the 22nd even reached 134 vehicles, representing the highest monthly and shift production of cars since this year. The third quarter production plan for trucks was also overfulfilled by 305 vehicles ahead of schedule by the 24th. The automobile output in this quarter increased by 42% compared with the same period last year, equivalent to 88% of the total output in the first half of this year.

The first batch of 30 "Red Flag" luxury sedans, manufactured during mass trial production, were all shipped to Beijing on time on the 22nd. Now, this type of luxury sedan is being mass-produced in batches according to plan.

In terms of conservation, the factory saved 1,293 tons of steel materials, exceeding the gift plan by 108%; saved 1,671 tons of coal, saving 371 tons more than the gift plan; the consumption of kinetic energy, tools, and lubricating oil, rags, etc., has also been significantly reduced.

Due to the significant results of increased production and conservation, the cost of automobile production has been reduced, and the labor productivity of the entire factory has greatly improved in September. The preliminary estimate of automobile costs in September is 0.5% lower than the same period last year and 0.87% lower than in August; labor productivity is 20% higher than the national planned target for the month.

In this year's increased production and conservation campaign, the First Automobile Works organized mass battles, major assaults, major inspections, major evaluations, and major victory reports. Since the second half of the year, the mass movement has been surging forward wave after wave. Entering July, from the mass rectification of production order, strengthening equipment management, and emphasizing product quality, and other organizational and ideological construction, the movement developed into an increased production and conservation campaign centered on improving product quality. In August and September, all the employees of the factory thoroughly implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the CPC on further carrying out the increased production and conservation campaign, swept away right-leaning thoughts, greatly boosted morale, and pushed this movement to a new high tide of all-round leap forward with high-quality and high-yield as the main content. From the factory to the production team, plans were made at all levels to present gifts to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation. The factory successively formed 448 shock teams, targeting various production bottlenecks, and launched large-scale battles and assaults. The workers and masses were in high spirits, carrying out technical innovations and breaking through production bottlenecks. By September 23, a total of 549 technical innovations and 246 rationalization proposals were implemented in the factory, and 657 key problems were solved.

After the vigorous development of the movement in August and September, the factory organized inspection teams of more than 2,000 people to carry out mass inspections and evaluations, promptly discovering and solving problems, thus creating a situation of constantly revising gift plans and learning from and catching up with advanced experiences, promoting the movement to develop more persistently and deeply. In mid-August and September, 80% of the work departments, 70% of the groups, and 54% of the departments revised their gift plans and proposed higher leap-forward goals. By the 23rd, 849 work departments, groups, and departments had completed all or part of their gift plans.

    优质高产　降低成本
    第一汽车厂超产载重车三百辆
    提前六天完成第三季度汽车生产计划
    新华社长春26日电　第一汽车制造厂职工已经超额完成9月份和第三季度的汽车生产计划，提前实现了向建国十周年献礼的计划。
    9月份到24日止，共装配载重汽车一千八百零二辆，超过全月计划二百零二辆；在这二十四天中，有十一天达到班产一百辆以上，22日班产更高达一百三十四辆，出现了今年以来月产和班产汽车的最高纪录。第三季度生产载重汽车的计划，到24日也已超额三百零五辆提前完成。这一季度的汽车产量比去年同期增长42％，相当于今年上半年产量总和的88％。
    “红旗”牌高级轿车在成批试生产中制造出来的第一批三十辆，已经在22日全部按时发往北京。现在，这种高级轿车正按计划陆续地成批试生产。
    在节约方面，全厂节约钢铁材料达一千二百九十三吨，超额108％完成了献礼计划；节约用煤一千六百七十一吨，比献礼计划多省了三百七十一吨；动能、工具以及机油、擦布等的消耗，也都有显著降低。
    由于增产节约成果显著，汽车生产成本降低了，全厂劳动生产率在9月份有了很大提高。9月份汽车成本初步预计比去年同期降低0.5％，比8月份降低0.87％；劳动生产率比当月国家计划指标提高20％。
    第一汽车制造厂在今年的增产节约运动中，组织了群众性的大会战、大突击、大检查、大评比、大报捷。下半年以来，群众运动一浪高过一浪，滚滚向前。进入7月，从群众性的整顿生产秩序、加强设备管理，重视产品质量等组织建设和思想建设，发展到以提高产品质量为中心的增产节约运动。到了8、9月，全厂职工深入贯彻党的八届八中全会的决议和中共吉林省委关于进一步开展增产节约运动的指示，猛扫右倾，大鼓干劲，更把这一运动推向以优质高产为主要内容的全面跃进新高潮。从厂到生产小组，层层订出了向建国十周年献礼的计划。全厂先后组成了四百四十八个突击队，针对各种生产关键，展开了大会战、大突击。职工群众精神抖擞，大搞技术革新，大破生产关键。到9月23日统计，全厂共实现技术革新五百四十九项，合理化建议二百四十六项，解决关键问题六百五十七个。
    8、9月间运动轰轰烈烈展开以后，全厂又组织二千多人参加的检查团，展开了群众性的大检查、大评比，及时发现和解决问题，从而又出现了不断修订献礼计划、学先进赶先进的局面，推动运动更加持久深入地开展。8、9月中，有80％的工部，70％的小组，54％的科室，修订了献礼计划，提出了更高的跃进目标。到23日，已全部或部分完成献礼计划的工部、小组、科室，已经有八百四十九个。
