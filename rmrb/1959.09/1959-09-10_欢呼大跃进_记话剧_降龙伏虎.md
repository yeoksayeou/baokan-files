	Hail the Great Leap Forward
	— On the Drama "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger"
	By our correspondent Zhou Jianying
	Throughout the ages, many heroes have passed. The times have called on them to give way to today's people's heroes. Today's heroes do things that their predecessors could not, they carve out mountains and build a socialist paradise on earth. The drama "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger," which premiered at the China Youth Art Theatre on the 10th, depicts how brave and intelligent mountain farmers in the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, opposed conservatism and supported the advanced; established science and broke superstition, and fought a beautiful battle with nature, finally building a large bridge over the raging Dragon Saliva River, transporting rich mineral deposits from the "Treasure Trove" – Tiger Head Mountain, to build their hometown and support the nation's steel production.

	In this battle with heaven and earth, the power of the masses was displayed first and foremost. Yin Zhefu, an engineer from the provincial capital, wanted to help the mountain people build a bridge with great enthusiasm. Unfortunately, conservative thinking clouded his vision and he could not see the strength of the masses. Thus, the facts ruthlessly taught him a lesson: In one day and night, with the help of technicians Meng Danhua and He Guochang, everyone made more than a hundred bridge models. Even Yin Zhefu himself had to nod and say "Good!" after seeing these models. After several days of hard work, everyone successfully tested the method of building bridge piers in the rapids using cofferdams. The situation was pressing! The flood was coming, everything was ready, waiting only for Yin Zhefu's engineering drawings. The engineer, seeing that he was about to lose to the masses in this "competition," was truly unconvinced. In a fit of pique, he pulled the renownedly brave Zhao Dakang and Jin Delong to risk crossing Ghost Gate Shoal to measure the water level. A large whirlpool overturned the boat, and if the masses had not come to save him, he would have almost lost his life. In his illness, Yin Zhefu, watching the villagers constantly coming to visit and comfort him, began to understand the simplest and most important truth in the world, his eyes shining with emotion: the masses are the great force driving social progress.

	Here, we see how the kind working people use their growing communist style to resolve ideological contradictions with each other. This style is embodied in mankind's most sublime love, illuminating people's eyes and souls, enabling them to see further and love deeper. The vigorous young man Zhao Dakang and the hero of Dragon Gate Commune, Jin Delong, had a "contradiction" as soon as they met. Both wanted to take down the "Recruitment Notice" and go into the water to contract for building bridge piers. It seemed like they were really fierce and unwilling to give way, and were about to fight, but when they heard that the County Party Secretary wanted them to lead the "Taming the Dragon" and "Subduing the Tiger" underwater commando teams, each building a bridge section, these two heroes immediately burst into laughter and drank a toast. Zhao Dakang and Li Yutao, a loving couple, also had a dispute during the bridge construction. The wife became the construction site director, and the husband, disregarding discipline, anxiously went to steal construction of the bridge piers. The construction site director gave him a stern criticism, and the young man, unable to save face, walked away in a huff. After Li Yutao explained the greater righteousness behind his back, the husband submitted to the truth, and their love for each other deepened.

	The Party's leadership is like a rainbow spanning the sky, running through the entire drama. The resolute, decisive, and approachable County Party Secretary Lao Xing always solved the contradictions among the people in a persuasive manner. He impartially led this mountain construction team, moving forward firmly. In certain situations, he was decisive; in other situations, he was humorous. He could pinpoint people's shortcomings and open others' minds with a simple truth. One day at dawn, while tending to the engineer who fell ill from falling into the water by the campfire, he earnestly pointed out the engineer's mistake of not believing in the masses and then recklessly crossing Ghost Gate Shoal, analyzing that it was mainly individualism at work, wanting to show off in front of the masses. This criticism cleared the engineer's head, and he was sincerely convinced. Later, he relied on the masses to carry out his work, contributing his bridge-building knowledge even better.

	The birth of "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger" was not accidental. The authors, Duan Chengbin and Du Shijun, were sent down to mountain areas in Jilin Province and rural areas in Jiangsu Province last year, respectively. In their practical lives, they discovered many admirable and lovable people. These heroes, for the sake of the motherland's leap forward, never gave up and were full of energy. Last Spring Festival, the peasants of Sankeshu Township in Tonghua County went up the mountain to build water conservancy projects. They were not afraid of the cold and fought hard all night long, persisting until the sowing season. When the young men in the mountains fought drought, they went up the mountain to dig wells, not returning home for four days and four nights, digging hundreds of wells in one breath, finally overcoming the drought and ensuring a bumper harvest of rice.

	Day and night, the authors were moved by the heroic spirit, fell in love with these people, fell in love with this life of galloping horses, and could not help but pick up their pens to sing their praises.

	The play is directed by Wu Xue, and the main actors include Zhang Ping, Yu Cun, An Ran, Yu Daiqin, Liu Yansheng, Wang Shangxin, Du Peng, Liu Kai, etc. From the writing of the script to the performance, opinions from all parties were solicited and revised more than thirty times. It embodies the hard work and feelings of many actors. Many of the actors who played the working people in the play had lived in the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir and Miyun Reservoir construction sites, and some had also gone to the countryside. They met many heroes and good men on the production front, and also compiled short plays based on their moving deeds for propaganda and performance. This time, when rehearsing "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger," the actors enriched the characters' personalities based on their own feelings. For example, the characters of Grandpa Zhao and Uncle Qin are very distinct, which is the result of great efforts by the actors Du Peng and others. People praise the actress Yu Daiqin for playing Li Yutao as spicy, capable, and efficient, especially in the scene where she is the construction site director, with the demeanor of Mu Guiying taking command. Yu Daiqin said: "Hey, there are many such heroines at the reservoir construction site, I learned from them."

	A drop of water can reflect the sun, and the great changes in a remote mountain corner symbolize the leaps forward in all parts of the country. The drama "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger" pulsates with the rhythm of the times and shines with the brilliance of the times. It writes an enthusiastic ode to the Great Leap Forward of 1958!

### 欢呼大跃进——记话剧“降龙伏虎”

    欢呼大跃进
    ——记话剧“降龙伏虎”	    本报记者　周建英
    千古以来，多少豪杰，都过去了。时代叫他们让位给今天的人民英雄。今天的英雄做出前辈好汉不能做的事，他们开山辟地，在地上建立起社会主义的天堂。十日起在中国青年艺术剧院公演的话剧“降龙伏虎”，就是描写大跃进中骁勇、聪明的山区农民，在党的领导下，怎样反保守、扶先进；立科学、破迷信，和大自然打了漂亮的一仗，终于在凶猛的龙涎河上架起一座大桥，从“百宝库”——虎头山里运出富藏的矿石，建设自己的家乡，支援全国的钢铁生产。
    在这场和天地的战斗中，首先显示了人多力量大的威力。从省城来的工程师尹哲夫怀着满腔热情想帮助山区人民建大桥。可惜，保守思想遮住了自己的视线，看不到千军万马的群众力量。于是，事实无情地来教训他：一个昼夜，大伙儿在技术员孟丹华、贺国昌帮助下，制造出一百多座大桥模型，这些模型，连尹哲夫自己见了，也不得不点头说声“好！”几天奋战，大伙儿又把用隔水圈在急流中砌桥墩的办法试验成功了。形势逼人呵！洪水要到来，万事俱备，就等尹哲夫的工程图了，工程师眼看着自己在这场“竞赛”中要输给群众了，心里真不服。气急之下，拉了勇猛著称的赵大康和金德龙冒险强渡鬼门滩，去测量水位。一个大旋涡，卷翻了船，要不是群众赶来救了他，几乎丧失生命。尹哲夫在病中，望着不断前来探病、慰问的老乡们，激动地闪着泪光，开始明白了世界上最朴素而重要的真理：群众才是推动社会前进的伟大动力。
    这里，我们看到善良的劳动人民，怎样让自己日益成长的共产主义风格，来解决彼此间的思想矛盾。这种风格体现成人类最崇高的爱，照亮了人的眼睛和灵魂，使他们看得更远，爱得更深。生龙活虎般的青年人赵大康和龙门公社的好汉金德龙一见面就发生“矛盾”。两人都要揭下“招贤榜”，下水去包建桥墩。看来真是气势凶凶，各不相让，正要出手比武，听得县委书记要他俩领导“降龙”、“伏虎”两个水下突击队，各建大桥时，这两个英雄立即笑声朗朗，交杯饮酒了。一向相亲相爱的夫妇——赵大康和李玉桃，在建桥时也发生了纠纷。妻子当了工地主任，丈夫不守纪律心急地去偷建桥墩。工地主任给了一顿严厉批评，小伙子下不了台，憋着气走了。经过李玉桃在人背后晓以大义，丈夫服从了真理，彼此相爱更笃了。
    党的领导，像万里彩虹，贯串了全剧。刚毅果断而又平易近人的县委书记老邢，总是那样循循善诱地解决了人民之间的矛盾。他不偏不倚领导着这支山区建设队伍，坚定不移地向前迈进。在某种场合下，他斩钉截铁；在另一种场合下，他又谈笑风生。他会一针见血地指出人们的缺点，也会用一个简单的道理，打开别人的心窍。有一天黎明，他一面在篝火边给因落水生病的工程师看药，一面恳切地指出了工程师从不相信群众到冒险渡鬼门滩的错误，给他分析这主要是个人主义思想作祟，光想自己在群众面前露一手。这批评使工程师的头脑清醒起来，口服心服。后来他依靠群众进行工作，把自己的建桥知识更好地贡献出来。
    “降龙伏虎”的诞生不是偶然的。作者段承滨和杜士俊，去年分别下放到吉林省山区和江苏省农村。他们在实际生活中发现许多可敬可爱的人物。这些英雄为了祖国的跃进，百折不回，干劲冲天。去年春节，通化县三棵榆树乡的农民上山修水利，他们不怕天寒地冻，连夜苦战，一直坚持到播种季节，山区小伙子们抗旱时上山打井，四天四夜不回家，一口气打出了几百口井，终于战胜旱灾，保住水稻大丰收。
    日日夜夜，作者为英雄气概所激动，爱上了这些人，爱上了这万马奔腾般的生活，情不自禁地要拿起笔来歌颂他们。
    这个剧由吴雪导演，主要演员有张平、于村、安冉、于黛琴、刘燕生、王尚信、杜澎、刘凯等。剧本从写成到演出，征求了各方面的意见，修改了三十多次，它凝结着许多演员的心血和感情，扮演剧中劳动人民的好些演员，曾在十三陵水库、密云水库工地生活过，有的还去了农村。他们结识了许多生产战线上的英雄好汉，也为他们动人的事迹编了短剧，宣传演出过。这次排演“降龙伏虎”，演员就根据自己感受，丰富了角色的性格，如剧中的赵大爷和秦二伯人物性格很鲜明，就是演员杜澎等花了很大的努力塑造的。人们称赏演员于黛琴把李玉桃演得泼辣能干，干净利落，尤其是当工地主任一场，俨然是穆桂英挂帅的风度。于黛琴说：“嗨，这样的女英雄水库工地多的是，我是向她们学来的。”
    一粒水珠可以反映太阳，一个深山角落的巨变，寓意着全国各地的飞跃。话剧“降龙伏虎”跳动着时代的脉搏，闪烁着时代的光辉，它为1958年大跃进写下了一首热情澎湃的赞歌！
