	The Problem Isn't "I"
	Wang Yi

	The People's Daily published an article titled "Pretentiousness" in the "Essays on Writing Style" column on July 18th. After reading it, I have some thoughts.

	Some articles in newspapers and periodicals do have a pretentious air, not being so approachable. Chairman Mao pointed out in "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing" in 1942 that one manifestation of unhealthy tendencies is posturing and intimidating others. It seems that it still has its market today. I fully support Comrade Sun Yuanfan's proposal that writing should be simple, unadorned, and without pretentiousness.

	However, Comrade Sun Yuanfan's assertion that some authors like to use the word "I" in their communications and feature articles to illustrate that these authors are pretentious may not be appropriate.

	Just as novels allow both first-person and third-person narrative styles, why can't the author of a communication or feature article appear in the article? Why should an author be criticized and seen as self-aggrandizing simply for directly addressing the reader in their own identity? In fact, writing communications and feature articles in the first person, using the author's "I" to describe and comment on what they have seen and heard to the reader, sometimes has its unique advantages. This form is by no means without merit in all situations. As for saying that writing in this way is "centered on 'I'" and "always placing the author 'I' in a key position" to prove the author's arrogance and personal prominence, it is even less convincing. Some articles, even without using the first person, can still be pretentious; some articles, although written in the first person, are not necessarily pretentious. Comrade Wei Wei's "Who Are the Most Beloved People?" is a recognized excellent communication, and this communication is written precisely in the first person, using the author's "I" to narrate and express emotions. Can you say that this communication is pretentious? Merely judging that a report is pretentious simply because the author's "I" appears in it actually negates the use of the first-person expression technique in all reports.

	Comrade Sun Yuanfan cited an example in his article of a report with more than forty "I"s throughout the text. This example is relatively prominent. However, Comrade Sun Yuanfan did not specify the title of this report, so we cannot prematurely draw a conclusion about whether this report is pretentious. However, even if there is indeed such a report in the newspaper that is pretentious and uses many "I"s, can it be inferred that all reports using the first person are pretentious articles? No. Because there is no necessary connection between "person" and "pretentiousness," it is difficult to draw universal conclusions from examples lacking a necessary connection.

    问题不在“我”
    王毅
    7月18日人民日报八版登了一篇题为“架子”的文风杂谈，读后有些感想。
    报刊上某些文章，确实有副架势，不是那么平易近人。毛主席在1942年“反对党八股”中指出过的歪风表现之一——装腔作势、借以吓人，看来今天还有它的市场。孙元凡同志提出写文章要平易朴素、不摆架子，我举双手拥护。
    可是，孙元凡同志以有些作者在通讯特写中好用“我”字，来说明这些作者有架子，就未必妥当。
    正像小说既允许第一人称又允许第三人称方式描述一样，为什么通讯特写作者就不可以在文章中出场呢？为什么作者一用自己的身份跟读者直接交谈，就要遭到非议，被看成为在自我表现呢？其实，以第一人称写通讯特写，通过作者“我”的眼睛，来向读者描述、评介他的所见所闻，有时倒有它的独特的长处，这种形式，决不是在任何场合都毫无可取。至于说用这种方式写作，就是“以‘我’为中心”，“处处不忘将作者本人‘我’放在关键地位”，来证明作者的自高自大，个人突出，更难令人信服。有的文章不用第一人称写，它仍旧可以是有架子的；有的文章，虽则以第一人称写，倒未必就有架子。魏巍同志的“谁是最可爱的人”，是公认出色的通讯，而这篇通讯的写法恰恰是用第一人称，通过作者的“我”来叙事抒情。你能说这篇通讯有架子吗？单凭报道中有作者的“我”出场，就判定报道作者有架子，实际上就会否定在一切报道中运用第一人称的表现手法了。
    孙元凡同志在文章里举了一篇全文共有四十多个“我”字报道作例子。这个例子是比较突出的。不过孙元凡同志没有注明这篇报道的篇名，我们就不能过早地替这篇报道下结论，这篇报道有没有架子。但是，即使报纸上确实有这么篇报道，它有架子，而且还用了许多“我”字，是不是由此可以推论，凡是用第一人称的报道都是有架子的文章呢？不能。因为“人称”与“架子”之间缺乏必然联系，从缺乏必然联系的例子中，难以得出普遍性的结论。
