Xinhua News Agency, 8th September. On the basis of the great achievements already made in the first eight months, the national electric power industry workers are continuing to forge ahead to complete and overfulfill this year's power generation plan.

In the first eight months of this year, the national power generation has reached 25.1 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 51% compared with the same period last year, and 12% more than the total power generation in 1957. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call for carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, a vigorous new upsurge in production has rapidly taken shape across the country. The electricity consumption of various enterprises has increased rapidly. Inspired by the call of the Party Central Committee, all employees of the electric power industry are doing everything possible to fully tap the potential of equipment, speed up the progress of capital construction, and strive to generate more electricity and supply more electricity to ensure the needs of continued leaps forward in all sectors of the national economy. Through the efforts of all employees, in late August, the average daily power generation of the ten key power grids, which account for more than 70% of the country's power generation, increased by 4.1% compared with mid-August; in the first four days of September, it increased by 4.2% compared with the average daily power generation in August.

Based on this situation, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power recently revised its production plan, requiring that by the end of this year, the national power generation will reach 39 billion kilowatt-hours. In this way, the electric power industry may approach completion this year of the minimum power generation target for 1962 set by the Second Five-Year Plan, and will be only about 10% away from the maximum power generation target for 1962 set by the Second Five-Year Plan.

The power generation to be achieved in 1962, as stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan, is 40 billion to 43 billion kilowatt-hours. It requires the electric power industry to maintain an annual growth rate of 15% to 17% in order to achieve this goal. However, last year's Great Leap Forward greatly shortened this distance. The new generating equipment capacity added last year was equal to the total generating equipment capacity left by the old China's electric power industry over sixty-seven years. The power generation also increased sharply from 19.3 billion kilowatt-hours in 1957 to 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of one and a half times the average annual growth rate stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan. This has created favorable conditions for completing the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

In order to ensure the completion and strive for overfulfillment of this year's production target of 39 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, the national electric power industry departments are now taking effective measures to strengthen the work on both capital construction and production fronts. In terms of capital construction, the main approach will be to concentrate efforts, ensure key projects, combine self-reliance with organized cooperation, and strive to put twenty to thirty new generating units into production within the month of September. In terms of production, the main measures are to strengthen power distribution, ensure safe operation, do a good job in planned maintenance and economize on electricity consumption, and strive to fully utilize existing equipment capacity with the lowest consumption to achieve the goal of generating more electricity and supplying more electricity.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th September. This year, the construction of China's electric power industry has continued to leap forward with giant strides. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, from January to August, the generating equipment capacity put into production in various regions was more than 700,000 kilowatts, an increase of 18% over the new generating equipment added in the same period last year. There are now 184 power stations under construction simultaneously across the country, and it is expected that another 1.6 million kilowatts of generating equipment will be installed by the end of this year. In this way, the new generating equipment capacity added in China this year will be equivalent to more than 90% of the total power generation capacity added during the First Five-Year Plan period, and will be 500,000 kilowatts more than the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

Many large-scale hydropower projects have entered the construction climax this year. After the successful completion of the damming of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project last year, tens of thousands of builders have been racing against the floods this year. In just seven months, they rushed to repair the dam to an elevation of 310 meters above sea level. At present, workers are installing steel pipes and embedded parts related to the turbines. After more than half a year of efforts, the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station has completely opened the 675-meter-long diversion tunnel, and thousands of workers are excavating the dam foundation and underground powerhouse on the left bank of the future dam. Although the Xinfengjiang and Xin'anjiang hydropower stations encountered extraordinarily heavy floods this spring and summer, after the heroic struggle of the workers, by the end of August, the dam projects of these two power stations had met the requirements for flood control and water storage, and the generating equipment will soon begin to be installed.

In terms of thermal power generation, twenty-five large-scale power stations are under large-scale construction this year. The design capacity of these power stations is all above 100,000 kilowatts. At the Beijing Thermal Power Station, China's first 100,000-kilowatt high-voltage and high-temperature generating unit will be put into production this year. This special large-scale generating unit is the latest product manufactured by the Soviet Union for China.

Due to the accelerated construction of a large number of large power stations, the newly added power generation capacity in major regions of China this year has exceeded any previous year. In the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang alone, the generating equipment installed by the end of August was 216,000 kilowatts, and it is expected that the new equipment put into operation by the end of the year will greatly exceed this number.

The medium and small-sized power stations built in various places have also blossomed everywhere in the first eight months of this year. According to statistics, the total capacity of small-sized generating equipment with a capacity of 6,000 kilowatts or less that has been put into operation nationwide is about 100,000 kilowatts. The rapid completion of these small power stations has strongly supported the industrial production in some areas with relatively tight power supply, enabling many relatively remote places that have never had electricity, such as Yongchang in Gansu, Yiyang in Henan, and Heshan in Guangxi, to use electricity for the first time.

At present, a production increase and economy campaign that is even larger in scale than the previous eight months is rapidly unfolding on various electric power industry construction sites. Inspired by the militant call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, mass rallies were held on various construction sites to criticize the right-leaning slack mood among some cadres, and to launch a socialist labor competition upsurge by exchanging war pledges with each other. Their slogans for action are: "Seize September, strive to complete and overfulfill the annual installation plan, and greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with new achievements."

    电力工业迈开巨人步伐　为大跃进添热增光
    发电量头八月比去年同期猛增51％
    今年全年可发电390亿度，接近原订1962年的指标
    184个电站同时施工，已新增发电设备70万瓩，到年底可增加230万瓩
    新华社8日讯　全国电力工业职工在前八个月已经取得巨大成就的基础上，正在继续快马加鞭争取完成和超额完成今年的发电量计划。
    今年头八个月，全国发电量已达到二百五十一亿度，比去年同期增长了51％，比1957年全年的发电量还多12％。中共八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动号召发出后，一个轰轰烈烈的生产新高潮已在全国迅速形成。各企业的用电量迅速增加。电力工业全体职工在党中央的号召鼓舞下，正在千方百计地充分挖掘设备潜力，加快基本建设速度，力争多发电，多供电，保证国民经济各部门继续跃进的需要。经过全体职工的努力，8月下旬，占全国发电量70％以上的十个重点电力网平均日发电量比中旬增长了4.1％；9月头四天，又比8月份平均日发电量增长了4.2％。
    根据这个情况，水利电力部最近修订的生产计划，要求到今年年底，全国发电量将达三百九十亿度，这样，电力工业在今年内就有可能接近完成第二个五年计划规定的1962年的最低发电量指标，距离第二个五年计划规定的1962年最高发电量指标只差10％左右。
    第二个五年计划规定的1962年应达到的发电量，是四百亿到四百三十亿度。它要求电力工业必须每年保持15％到17％的增长速度才能达到这个目标。可是去年一年的大跃进，使这个距离大大缩短了。去年全国新增加的发电设备容量，就等于发展了六十七年的旧中国电力工业留下的全部发电设备容量，发电量也从1957年的一百九十三亿度猛增到二百七十五亿度，比第二个五年计划规定的平均年增长速度提高一倍半。这样就为提前完成第二个五年计划创造了有利条件。
    为了保证完成和争取超额完成今年三百九十亿度电力的生产任务，现在全国电力工业部门正在采取有效措施，加强基本建设和生产两条战线的工作。在基本建设方面，主要将采用集中力量，保证重点，自力更生和组织协作相结合的办法，争取在9月一个月内，就有二十到三十套新发电设备投入生产。在生产方面，主要措施是加强电力分配工作，保证安全运行，做好计划检修和节约用电等，争取以最低消耗，充分利用现有设备能力，达到多发电，多供电的目的。
    据新华社8日讯　我国电力工业建设今年又以巨人的步伐继续向前跃进。根据水利电力部的统计，1月至8月，各地投入生产的发电设备容量有七十万瓩以上，比去年同期新增加的发电设备增长18％。现在全国有一百八十四个电站正在同时施工，预计到今年年底，还有一百六十万瓩左右的发电设备可以安装完毕。这样，今年一年内，我国新增加的发电设备容量就将相当于第一个五年计划期间新增加的全部发电能力的90％多，比大跃进的1958年还多五十万瓩以上。
    许多特大型的水力发电工程，今年大部分都已进入施工高潮。三门峡水利枢纽工程在去年胜利完成截流以后，几万名建设者今年以来一直在同洪水赛跑。他们在短短七个月内，就把拦河大坝抢修到了拔海三百一十米的高程。目前职工们正在安装同水轮机有关的钢管及预埋件等。刘家峡水电站经过半年多的努力，已经把长达六百七十五米的导流隧洞全部打通，几千名职工正在未来拦河大坝的左岸山峰上开挖坝基和地下厂房。新丰江和新安江两水电站虽然在今年春夏遇到特大洪水的冲击，但是经过职工们的英勇搏斗，到8月底，这两个电站的大坝工程已经达到拦洪蓄水的要求，发电设备也即将开始安装。
    在火力发电方面，今年有二十五个大型电站正在大规模施工。这些电站的设计能力都在十万瓩以上。在北京热电站，今年将有我国第一套十万瓩的高压高温发电设备投入生产。这套特大型发电设备是苏联为我国制造的最新产品。
    由于大批大型电站的加快建设，今年我国各主要地区新增加的发电能力，都超过了以往任何一年。仅辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省，到8月底已安装完毕的发电设备就有二十一万六千瓩，预计到年底，投入运行的新设备将大大超过此数。
    各地建设的中小型电站，今年头八个月也遍地开花。据统计，全国已发电的六千瓩以下的小型发电设备，总容量就有十万瓩左右。这些小电站的迅速建成，有力地支援了一些电源比较紧张地区的工业生产，使许多比较偏僻、一向没有电的地方，如甘肃永昌，河南伊阳，广西合山等地，第一次用到了电。
    现在，一个比前八个月还要规模壮阔的增产节约运动，正在各个电力工业建设工地上迅速展开。在党的八届八中全会的战斗号召鼓舞下，各工地纷纷召开群众大会，批判了某些干部中的右倾松劲情绪，并且互下战表，掀起了社会主义劳动竞赛高潮。他们的行动口号是：“大抓9月份，争取完成和超额完成全年装机计划，以新的成就迎接国庆十周年”。
