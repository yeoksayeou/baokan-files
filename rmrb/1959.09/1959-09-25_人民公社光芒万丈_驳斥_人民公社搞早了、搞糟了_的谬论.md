The People's Commune was produced by the broad masses of laboring peasants in our country under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, and during the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958. This is a manifestation of the great will of hundreds of millions of peasants in our country, a continuation and development of the socialist revolution in our country's rural areas, and a great initiative of our people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao. Now, hostile elements at home and abroad and right-leaning opportunists have carried out all kinds of malicious slanders against the People's Commune, saying: "The People's Commune was stirred up by a few people," "The People's Commune was started too early and botched up," and so on. This is a complete confusion of right and wrong, a reversal of black and white, and the facts powerfully shatter this fallacy.

Was the People's Commune stirred up by a few people? Was it started too early?

After the rectification movement and the struggle between the two roads in our country's rural areas in 1957, the socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants soared to unprecedented heights. During the large-scale water conservancy movement in the winter of 1957 and the spring of 1958, many regions saw communist-style large-scale cooperation that transcended the boundaries of cooperatives, townships, and even counties, followed by the phenomenon of merging smaller cooperatives into larger ones. For example, in Henan Province, at the beginning of 1958, there were 49,000 agricultural cooperatives, which were merged into 37,000 by June 1958. At the beginning of 1958, there were 789,000 agricultural cooperatives nationwide, which were merged into 741,000 by June 1958.

Large-scale water conservancy projects promoted a series of changes in agricultural production and rural relations of production. In order to build water conservancy projects, a large amount of labor and building materials were needed; at the same time, with water conservancy, it was necessary to increase the application of fertilizer, followed by a series of tool reforms, and so on. In this way, the original organizational form of small-scale agricultural cooperatives that only engaged in agriculture appeared to be incompatible with the requirements of rapidly and extensively developing diversified operations. As early as before the Beidaihe Conference of the CPC Central Committee, some of the earliest established People's Communes, such as the Chayashan People's Commune in Suiping, Henan, and the Qiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang, had already attracted hundreds of thousands of rural cadres from all over the country to visit and learn from them, and learning from these communes had become an unstoppable trend. By the end of August 1958, 8,730 new social organizations integrating industry and agriculture and engaging in comprehensive operations—People's Communes—had emerged nationwide.

With the development of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the movement for the people's commune system progressed even faster in the second half of 1958. After the Central Committee's "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas" (August 29, 1958) was announced, a massive upsurge in realizing the people's commune system was rapidly launched across the country. In less than two months, more than 740,000 agricultural cooperatives in rural areas nationwide formed 26,000 People's Communes.

The movement for the people's commune system, which emerged in the context of the great leap forward in agricultural production and the enormous increase in the socialist consciousness of the peasants, was a manifestation of the strong desire of more than 500 million peasants in our country for socialist revolution, and a necessary product of historical development. Can such a mass movement for the people's commune system, which was vigorously carried out throughout the country, be said to have been "stirred up by a few people"?

Right-leaning opportunists say: "The People's Commune was started too early and too quickly." According to their logic, People's Communes should not have been established at all at the present time, and if they were established, they would inevitably collapse. But the facts are exactly the opposite of their logic. Since the establishment of the People's Communes, not only has not a single one collapsed, but after the rectification of the communes last winter and this spring, the People's Communes have rapidly embarked on a path of more consolidated and sound development.

At the end of 1958, there were a total of 26,000 People's Communes nationwide, with an average of about 4,600 households per commune. After adjustments and mergers, there are now a total of 24,000 People's Communes nationwide, with an average of about 5,100 households per commune, a scale approximately equal to 30 times that of the former agricultural cooperatives. Is the healthy development of our country's People's Communes a sign that they were started too early? Or too quickly? If they were stirred up by a few people, would they have developed so healthily and rapidly?

Were the People's Communes botched up?

The People's Commune has only been established for a year, a very short time, but even in such a short time, it has most fully demonstrated its strong vitality and unparalleled superiority.

The People's Commune system has greatly accelerated the development of agricultural production in our country, and an unprecedented great leap forward in agricultural production has emerged.

In 1958, the total grain output in our country reached 500 billion catties, an increase of 130 billion catties over 1957, an increase of 35%, equivalent to more than twice the total increase of 61.2 billion catties produced by individual peasants and agricultural cooperatives during the first five-year plan. In 1958, the total cotton output reached 42 million dan, an increase of 28% over 1957, greatly exceeding the average annual growth rate of 4.7% of individual peasants and agricultural cooperatives during the first five-year plan. The output of other economic crops also developed greatly.

Before and after the people's commune system was established, a large-scale mass production and construction movement centered on the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture was widely carried out in 1958. In that year, water conservancy projects expanded the irrigated area by 480 million mu, the area for controlling waterlogging in low-lying areas was 210 million mu, the area under preliminary control for soil and water conservation was 320,000 square kilometers, the improved soil area was 140 million mu, the deeply plowed land was 680 million mu, the masses accumulated more than 300 billion dan of fertilizer, the area for promoting improved varieties was 1.75 billion mu, the area for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests was 1.8 billion mu, and 210 million pieces of various agricultural implements were improved and promoted. Therefore, it effectively guaranteed the great bumper harvest in agricultural production and the widespread emergence of large areas of high-yielding fields. In 1958, the average grain yield per mu increased by 35% over the previous year, soybeans increased by 37.1%, cotton increased by 28.9%, ambary hemp increased by 22.7%, and flue-cured tobacco increased by 44.8%.

Under the unified arrangement of the People's Commune, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery all developed comprehensively in 1958. The agricultural output value increased by 25.5% over the previous year; the forestry output value increased by 193.2%; the fishery output value increased by 128%; the animal husbandry output value increased by 5.2%. While the People's Commune vigorously developed industry, agricultural water conservancy construction, and transportation, it also paid attention to the arrangement of sideline production, and the sideline output value still maintained the level of the previous year.

The above-mentioned total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery increased by 25% compared with 1957, which is even higher than the growth rate of 24.7% of the total output value of individual peasants and agricultural cooperatives during the first five-year plan.

This year's summer harvest further demonstrated the power of the People's Commune. According to preliminary statistics, the yield per unit area of winter wheat increased by 22% compared with the bumper harvest of 1958; the yield per unit area of summer miscellaneous grains also increased by 20% compared with 1958. Such a high growth rate was not seen in the past agricultural cooperative period. This year, spring wheat and early rice in various places have also achieved bumper harvests.

People's Commune industries are blooming everywhere, powerfully promoting the great development of rural industries

According to a survey of 17 provinces, People's Communes established approximately more than 80,000 farm tool manufacturing and repair factories in 1958, producing and repairing more than 100 million pieces of farm tools; more than 600,000 steel and iron smelting furnaces, smelting more than 2.4 million tons of native iron and 530,000 tons of native steel (excluding the native steel produced by local industries in cities, special districts, and counties); 59,000 coal kilns, producing 25.3 million tons of raw coal; more than 9,000 cement plants, producing more than 290,000 tons of cement; more than 4,000 small power stations, generating 36.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. In addition, a large number of native fertilizer plants, grain processing plants, oil pressing plants, sugar refineries, and sewing factories, etc., serving agricultural production and the lives of commune members, were also established.

In 1959, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, People's Commune industries were rectified. According to recent statistics, there are currently approximately 700,000 industrial units in People's Communes nationwide, with a total output value approximately twice that of the previous year, accounting for approximately 10% of the total industrial output value nationwide. The output of major industrial products has increased several times over. The output of major products in the first half of 1959 increased compared with the same period last year by approximately: steel 5.3 times, iron 103 times, power generation 22 times, raw coal 6 times, native fertilizer 7.2 times, timber transported out 0.6 times, and threshers 3.1 times.

According to a typical survey of more than 7,000 People's Commune industrial production units in the first half of this year, production materials and consumer goods each account for approximately half of the total industrial output value. Among them, about 33% serve agricultural production, about 46% serve the lives of commune members, about 17% serve industry and basic construction, and about 4% serve exports. Of these industries, about 58% are directly led by the People's Commune, about 23% are led by the management area, and about 19% are led by the production team. The People's Commune vigorously developing industry and the peasants vigorously developing industry is a great initiative of our people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. People's Communes running industries not only make the distribution of industries more reasonable and the production site and consumption site closer, but more importantly, they break the mysterious view of running industries, cultivate a large number of industrial and technical forces, and find a specific path to realize rural industrialization and reduce the gap between urban and rural areas. This is a great victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction. These indisputable facts cannot be denied by anyone.

After the commune system, rural transportation has also developed greatly.

In 1958, 150,000 kilometers of new highways were built nationwide, of which approximately two-thirds or more were built by People's Communes, which greatly accelerated the speed of highway construction nationwide. In terms of railway construction, People's Communes have also made great contributions, organizing a large amount of labor to participate in railway construction work. The People's Communes along the Beijing-Guangzhou and Tianjin-Pukou railways mobilized 1.5 million people to participate in the double-track construction project, completing more than 2,700 kilometers of roadbed engineering, thereby shortening the time for constructing the double-track project, which played a great role in alleviating the tense situation of north-south transportation.

In the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially in the large-scale steelmaking movement last winter, People's Communes nationwide mobilized approximately 20% of animal-drawn carts and handcarts, and 30% of wooden sailboats, forming a mighty transportation team, working day and night, to complete a large number of transportation tasks for the country. In 1958, the volume of freight transported by People's Communes accounted for approximately 30% of the volume of local transportation freight nationwide, and approximately one-fifth of the volume of freight nationwide.

With the realization of the People's Commune system, new types of specialized transportation organizations have emerged in our country's rural areas. According to a survey of nine provinces including Jiangsu and Hubei in the first half of 1959, approximately 40% of People's Communes have established specialized transportation teams. In some areas, almost all People's Communes have established specialized transportation teams, with an average of 40 to 50 animal-drawn carts and handcarts, or 10 wooden sailboats, and more than 40 laborers per specialized team. These specialized transportation organizations of People's Communes played an important role in the busy short-distance transportation this year.

In terms of railway transportation, new organizational forms of People's Communes running loading and unloading and running handling have also emerged. By the end of April 1959, 1,011 stations on railway lines nationwide had implemented organizational forms of People's Communes running loading and unloading and running handling, greatly shortening the cargo loading and unloading time and accelerating the railway turnover speed.

With the establishment of People's Communes, the construction speed of rural postal and telecommunications networks is very fast. By the end of 1958, 98% of People's Communes and 60% of production teams were able to make telephone calls, and approximately 69% of communes were equipped with telephone exchanges.

On the basis of the commune system and the great leap forward in agricultural production, commodity circulation has also developed rapidly.

In 1958, the value of agricultural and sideline products sold reached 22 billion yuan, exceeding any year in history, almost doubling compared with 1952 before collectivization, and also increasing by 27.6% compared with 1956 when advanced cooperatives were realized. In the first half of this year, the total amount of agricultural and sideline products sold by People's Communes and peasants increased by another 1.4 billion yuan compared with the same period last year, which further strengthened the economic ties between urban and rural areas and powerfully supported the development of industrial production.

The quantity of commodities provided by People's Communes also greatly exceeded any previous year. Calculated by production year, grain was 111.3 billion catties, an increase of 20% over the previous year (the average annual increase of individual peasants and agricultural cooperatives during the first five-year plan was 6.5%), cotton was 35 million dan, an increase of 23% over the previous year (the average annual increase of individual peasants and agricultural cooperatives during the first five-year plan was 5.3%), and flue-cured tobacco was 6.9 million dan, an increase of 38% over the previous year (the average annual increase of individual peasants and agricultural cooperatives during the first five-year plan was 5.5%).

Due to the increase in the quantity of commodities sold by People's Communes, the purchasing power of rural People's Communes and peasants reached 27.5 billion yuan in 1958, an increase of 26.9% over the previous year, of which the purchase of means of production increased by more than double over the previous year, and the purchase of consumer goods increased by 13% over the previous year. Such a growth rate is unprecedented in previous years, which is extremely beneficial to the development of agricultural production and the improvement of the living standards of commune members.

After the commune system, the lives of peasants have not declined, but have improved.

With the development of agricultural production, the expansion of commodity circulation, and the increase in monetary income, the living standards of peasants have improved significantly. In 1958, the income level and living standards of each peasant increased by approximately 10% compared with 1957. Such a rapid increase in one year is unprecedented. During the first five-year plan, individual peasants and agricultural cooperatives increased by approximately 3.2% per person per year on average. The rapid improvement in the lives of peasants is obviously the result of the great leap forward in agricultural production and the people's commune system. Calculated based on peasant household income and expenditure survey data, each peasant consumed approximately 70 catties more grain, 3 catties more meat, and approximately 3 chi more cotton cloth in 1958.

In the first half of 1959, the living standards of peasants continued to improve somewhat. According to a survey of the income and expenditure of 1,899 peasant households in five provinces and regions including Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Hunan, the average per capita consumption expenditure of peasants in the first half of this year increased by approximately 6% compared with the same period last year, of which grain increased by 5%. The income of peasants in the summer harvest distribution in 1959 has been further improved. According to the summer harvest distribution survey data of 250 production teams in eight provinces including Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Guizhou, the average per capita distribution income increased by 33% compared with 1958, which further encouraged the labor enthusiasm of commune members. On the basis of increased income, the living standards of peasants will be further improved in the second half of the year.

In the great leap forward in agricultural production and under the organizational form of the People's Commune, the accumulation of People's Communes has greatly increased.

In 1958, the accumulation of rural People's Communes reached 10.1 billion yuan, more than doubling the accumulation of agricultural cooperatives in 1957, equivalent to more than half of the total accumulation of individual peasants and agricultural cooperatives during the first five-year plan. This fact powerfully proves how great the vitality of the People's Commune is in terms of expanded reproduction.

Rural basic construction in 1958 started with large-scale water conservancy projects. According to a survey of 17 provinces, People's Communes have built more than 240,000 large, medium, and small reservoirs in the past year, with a water storage capacity of 14.6 billion cubic meters in that year. After the actual test of this year's extraordinary floods, most of these projects are good, and only a very small part (approximately 3.2%) are of poor quality. By the end of 1958, the irrigated area of water conservancy in our country had reached 1 billion mu, and the proportion of the cultivated area nationwide had increased from 30.7% in 1957 to more than 60%. Right-leaning opportunists insisted that water conservancy was botched up and the losses outweighed the gains, which is obviously a shameless slander.

With the expansion of farmland water conservancy construction, the agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery owned by rural People's Communes has also greatly increased. By the end of 1958, People's Communes nationwide had a total of 1.6 million horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery and 150,000 kilowatts of hydropower equipment, of which more than 1 million horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery and 130,000 kilowatts of hydropower equipment were added in 1958 alone. All of this has greatly improved the ability of People's Communes in our country's rural areas to resist floods and droughts, and greatly enhanced the material foundation for fighting against natural disasters.

On the basis of expanded accumulation in 1958, People's Communes increased a large amount of agricultural machinery and equipment, new agricultural implements, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides. In the whole year of 1958, the newly added main agricultural machinery and equipment, transportation tools, and new agricultural implements of rural People's Communes were worth a total of 1.7 billion yuan, an increase of more than double compared with 560 million yuan in 1957, equivalent to approximately 60% of the total amount added during the first five-year plan. The growth of major means of production in rural People's Communes at the end of 1958 is as follows:

                       Number at the end of 1957   Number at the end of 1958
    Specially-made waterwheels (10,000 units)        181.8                   264
    Double-wheeled plows with shares (10,000 units)       164                    227
    Combine harvesters (units)        1,657                3,500

Due to the increase in agricultural machinery and equipment and new agricultural implements in 1958, the level of technical equipment per labor force has also greatly improved. The technical equipment (agricultural machinery and equipment and agricultural implements) per labor force increased by 13.3% compared with 1957, while the average annual increase during the first five-year plan was 3.3%. This guarantees the growth of agricultural labor productivity. Agricultural labor productivity increased by approximately 26% compared with the previous year in 1958, which marks that the backward state of agricultural production technology left over from history in our country is rapidly changing. This is a great change of historical significance.

With the development of production and construction in People's Communes, the construction of collective living and welfare undertakings in communes has also greatly increased. By the end of 1958, more than 3.4 million public canteens, 150,000 homes for the elderly, and more than 3.4 million various childcare organizations had been established in rural areas nationwide. The development of public welfare undertakings in communes has liberated tens of millions of rural women from tedious housework. At the same time, rural cultural and health undertakings have also developed rapidly. By the end of 1958, People's Communes had established nearly 60,000 cultural centers, more than 500,000 clubs, and more than 130,000 amateur theater troupes. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Health, in the first half of 1959, each commune established one or several health centers (hospitals), production brigades established health stations and maternity hospitals, and most production teams and natural villages had health rooms. The health work network centered on People's Communes has basically formed in our country's rural areas.

On the basis of the rapid development of various industrial and agricultural productions, cultural and educational undertakings have also achieved a leap forward. A mass literacy campaign on an unprecedented scale has been launched in various places. 40 million people have been eliminated from illiteracy nationwide, exceeding the total number of people eliminated from illiteracy in the past nine years. Countless amateur primary schools, amateur middle schools, amateur universities, red and expert schools, and cultural and technical schools have been established in various places, and scientific research organizations have been established relatively universally. Under the guidance of the policy of combining work-study programs and combining education with productive labor, new types of agricultural schools have been established in various places, which are of great significance for improving rural cultural and technical levels and promoting the development of productive forces.

The expansion of People's Commune construction and the increase in public accumulation in rural areas in 1958 have brought about significant changes in the proportion of accumulation and consumption in the national income of People's Communes in 1958. The proportion of accumulation increased from 10% in the previous year to 18.2%, and the proportion of consumption relatively decreased from 90% in the previous year to 81.8%. This change in the distribution proportion is not only very beneficial to improving people's lives and strengthening the expanded reproduction capacity of People's Communes, but also of great significance for the gradual transition of People's Communes from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. This fully demonstrates the great superiority of the People's Commune.

The above are the great and glorious achievements that the People's Commune has achieved in a short period of one year.

Right-leaning opportunists attack the People's Commune on one point and ignore the rest, only seeing the trees and not the forest, and are destined to suffer a shameful failure, and have already failed.

Now the People's Commune is like the rising sun, shining brightly, and is increasingly emitting its great heat and brilliant light. The people of the whole country are shouting:

Long live the People's Commune!

    人民公社光芒万丈
    ——驳斥“人民公社搞早了、搞糟了”的谬论
    贾启允
    人民公社是我国广大劳动农民在社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，在1958年工农业生产大跃进中产生的。这是我国几亿农民伟大意志的表现，是我国农村社会主义革命的继续和发展，是我国人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席领导下的伟大创举。现在，国内外敌对分子和右倾机会主义分子对人民公社进行了各种各样的恶毒的诬蔑，说：“人民公社是少数人轰起来的”，“人民公社搞早了、搞糟了”，等等。这完全是混淆是非、颠倒黑白，事实有力地粉碎了这种谬论。
    人民公社是否由少数人轰起来的呢？是否搞早了呢？
    我国农村经过1957年的整风运动和两条道路的斗争，广大农民的社会主义觉悟和劳动热情空前高涨。在1957年冬和1958年春大兴水利运动中，很多地区都发生了超越社界、乡界以至县界的共产主义的大协作，随之即出现了并大社的现象。例如河南省在1958年初，农业社为四万九千个，到1958年6月合并为三万七千个。1958年初全国共有农业社七十八万九千个，到1958年6月合并为七十四万一千个。
    大兴水利，促进了农业生产和农村生产关系一系列的变化。为了兴修水利，就需要大量的劳动力和建筑材料；同时，有了水利就需要增施肥料，接着就需要进行一系列的工具改革，等等。这样，原来小规模的单纯经营农业的农业合作社的组织形式，就显得同迅速地大规模地发展多种经营的要求不相适应了。早在中共中央北戴河会议以前，一些办得最早的人民公社，如河南遂平的嵖岈山人民公社、新乡的七里营人民公社等，已经吸引了全国各地几十万农村干部的参观访问，向这些公社学习已经成为不可阻挡之势。到1958年8月底，全国已经出现了工农业并举和综合经营的新的社会组织——人民公社八千七百三十个。
    随着农业生产大跃进的发展，1958年下半年人民公社化运动进展更快。自中央“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”（1958年8月29日）公布后，在全国范围内迅速掀起了一个声势浩大的实现人民公社化的高潮，在不到两个月的时间内，全国农村由七十四万多个农业社组成了二万六千个人民公社。
    在农业生产大跃进和农民社会主义觉悟巨大高涨的形势下所出现的人民公社化运动，这是我国五亿多农民社会主义革命强烈愿望的表现，是历史发展的必然产物。这样在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地开展的人民公社化的群众运动，难道能说是“少数人轰起来的”吗？
    右倾机会主义分子说：“人民公社搞早了，搞快了”。按照他们的逻辑，目前根本不应该办人民公社，办了也非垮台不可。但事实恰好与他们的逻辑相反，人民公社成立以来，不仅一个也没有垮台，而且经过去冬今春的整社，人民公社迅速的走上了更加巩固和健全的发展道路。
    1958年年底全国共有二万六千个人民公社，平均每社约四千六百余户。经过调整合并后，现在全国共有二万四千个人民公社，平均每社约五千一百户，规模大约等于过去农业社的三十倍。我国的人民公社这样健康地发展，难道是搞早了么？搞快了么？如果说是由少数人轰起来的，难道会有这样健康的迅速的发展么？
      人民公社是否搞糟了呢？
    人民公社成立仅一年，时间很短，但是，即使在短短一年的时间内，它已经最充分地表现出了强大生命力和无比的优越性。
    人民公社化大大加速了我国农业生产的发展，出现了史无前例的农业生产大跃进
    1958年我国粮食总产量达到五千亿斤，比1957年增长一千三百亿斤，增长35％，相当于第一个五年计划期间个体农民和农业社增产总量六百一十二亿斤的两倍多。1958年棉花总产量达到四千二百万担，比1957年增产28％，大大超过了第一个五年计划期间个体农民和农业社平均每年4.7％的增长速度。其他经济作物产量也有很大发展。
    在人民公社化前后，1958年广泛开展了以贯彻农业“八字宪法”为中心的大规模的群众性生产建设运动。这一年水利工程扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，洼改治涝面积二亿一千万亩，水土保持初步控制面积三十二万平方公里，改良土壤一亿四千万亩，深翻地六亿八千万亩，群众积肥三千亿担以上，推广良种面积十七亿五千万亩，防治病虫害十八亿亩，改良和推广各种农具二亿一千万件。因此，有力地保证了农业生产大丰收和大面积丰产田的广泛出现。1958年粮食每亩产量平均比上一年提高35％，大豆提高37.1％，棉花提高28.9％，黄洋麻提高22.7％，烤烟提高44.8％。
    在人民公社统一安排下，1958年农、林、牧、副、渔各业都有全面的发展，农业产值比上一年增长25.5％；林业产值增长193.2％；渔业产值增长128％；牧业产值增长5.2％；在人民公社大办工业、大办农田水利建设和大办交通运输业的同时，也注意了对副业生产的安排，副业产值仍保持了上一年的水平。
    上述农、林、牧、副、渔总产值比1957年增长25％，比第一个五年计划期间个体农民和农业社总产值增长24.7％的速度还高。
    今年的夏收进一步显示了人民公社的威力。据初步统计，冬小麦单位面积产量比大丰收的1958年增长22％；夏杂粮的单位面积产量也比1958年增长20％。这样高的增长速度，是在过去农业社时期所没有的。今年各地春麦和早稻也获得了丰收。
    人民公社工业遍地开花，有力地促进了农村工业的大发展
    根据十七个省的调查，1958年人民公社大约举办了农具制造厂和修理厂八万多个，生产和修理了农具一亿多件；炼钢、炼铁炉六十余万个，炼出土铁二百四十多万吨，土钢五十三万吨（不包括城市、专区和县的地方工业生产的土钢）；煤窑五万九千个，生产原煤二千五百三十万吨；水泥厂九千多个，生产水泥二十九万多吨；小型发电站四千多个，发电三千六百四十万度。此外，还建立了大量的为农业生产和社员生活服务的土化肥厂、粮食加工厂、榨油厂、制糖厂和缝纫厂，等等。
    1959年在党中央和毛主席的领导下，人民公社工业进行了整顿。根据最近的统计，目前全国人民公社的工业约有七十万个单位，总产值比上一年增长约两倍，占全国工业总产值的比重10％左右。主要工业品产量成倍增长。1959年上半年主要产品产量比去年同期的增长情况约为：钢五点三倍，铁一百零三倍，发电量二十二倍，原煤六倍，土化肥七点二倍，运出木材零点六倍，脱粒机三点一倍。
    根据今年上半年对七千多个人民公社工业生产单位的典型调查，在全部工业产值中，生产资料和消费资料大体各占一半。其中为农业生产服务的约占33％，为社员生活服务的约占46％，为工业和基本建设服务的约占17％，为出口服务的约占4％。在这些工业中，由人民公社直接领导的约占58％，由管理区领导的约占23％，由生产队领导的约占19％。人民公社大办工业，农民大办工业，这是我国人民在中国共产党领导下的伟大创举。人民公社办工业不仅使工业分布更加合理，生产地和消费地更加接近，更主要的是打破了办工业的神秘观点，培养了大批工业技术力量，找到了实现农村工业化和缩小城乡差别的具体道路。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，对于这些颠扑不破的事实，是任何人都无法否认的。
    公社化以后，农村交通运输事业也有很大的发展
    1958年全国新建公路十五万公里，其中由人民公社修建的约占三分之二以上，这样就使全国修建公路的速度大大加快了。在铁路建设方面，人民公社也作出了很大的贡献，组织了大量的劳动力参加铁路建设工作。在京广、津浦两条铁路沿线的人民公社，前后动员了一百五十万人参加复线建设工程，完成二千七百多公里的路基工程，从而缩短了修筑复线工程的时间，对于缓和南北交通运输紧张的局面起了很大的作用。
    在工农业生产大跃进中，特别是在去冬大办钢铁运动中，全国人民公社动员了大约20％的兽力车、人力车，30％的木帆船，组成了浩浩荡荡的运输队伍，披星戴月，为国家完成了大量的运输任务。1958年人民公社完成的货运量，约占全国地方交通货运量的30％左右，约占全国货运量的五分之一左右。
    随着人民公社化的实现，在我国农村中出现了新型的专业运输组织。根据1959年上半年江苏、湖北等九省调查，大约有40％的人民公社建立了专业运输队，有的地区几乎所有人民公社都建立了专业运输队，每一个公社专业队平均有兽力车、人力车四十到五十辆，或木帆船十艘，劳动力四十多人。这些人民公社的专业运输组织在今年繁忙的短途运输中，发挥了重要的作用。
    在铁路运输方面，也出现了人民公社办装卸、办搬运的新的组织形式。到1959年4月底，在全国铁路线上已有一千零十一个车站实行了人民公社办装卸、办搬运的组织形式，大大缩短了货物装卸时间，加快了铁路周转速度。
    随着人民公社的建立，农村邮电网的建设速度很快。到1958年底已有98％的人民公社和60％的生产队能通电话，并有69％左右的公社装有电话交换机。
    在公社化和农业生产大跃进的基础上，商品流通也有飞速的发展
    1958年出售农副业商品产值达到二百二十亿元，超过历史上的任何一年，与合作化前的1952年相比，几乎增加了一倍，与实现高级合作社的1956年相比，也增加了27.6％。今年上半年人民公社和农民出售的农副产品总额又比去年同期增加十四亿元，这就进一步密切了城乡之间的经济联系，有力地支援了工业生产的发展。
    人民公社提供的商品数量也大大超过以往任何一年，按生产年度计算，粮食为一千一百一十三亿斤，比上一年度提高20％（在第一个五年计划期间个体农民与农业社平均每年增长6.5％），棉花为三千五百万担，比上一年度提高23％（在第一个五年计划期间个体农民与农业社平均每年增长5.3％），烤烟为六百九十万担，比上一年提高38％（在第一个五年计划期间个体农民与农业社平均每年增长5.5％）。
    由于人民公社出售商品量的增加，1958年农村人民公社和农民购买力达到二百七十五亿元，比上一年增加26.9％，其中，购买生产资料比上一年增长一倍以上，购买消费资料比上一年增长13％。这样的增长速度是以往各年所未有的，这对于农业生产的发展和社员生活水平的提高都是极为有利的。
  公社化以后，农民生活不是降低了，而是提高了
    随着农业生产的发展，商品流通量的扩大和货币收入的增加，农民生活水平显著地提高了。1958年每一农民收入水平和生活水平比1957年大约提高10％左右。一年提高这样快，是空前未有的。在第一个五年计划期间个体农民和农业社，大约每人每年平均提高3.2％。农民生活的迅速提高，显然是农业生产大跃进和人民公社化的结果。根据农民家庭收支调查资料计算，1958年每一农民大约多消费粮食七十多斤，肉食三斤多，棉布三尺左右。
    1959年上半年农民生活水平继续有所提高，根据河北、内蒙古、黑龙江、吉林、湖南等五省区一千八百九十九户的农民家庭收支调查，今年上半年农民平均每人消费额比去年同期提高6％左右，其中粮食提高5％。1959年夏收分配中农民收入有更进一步的提高，根据河北、山西、河南、陕西、安徽、江苏、湖北、贵州等八个省二百五十个生产队的夏收分配调查资料，每人平均分配收入较1958年增加33％，这就进一步鼓舞了社员的劳动热情。在收入增加的基础上，下半年农民生活水平将会有更大的提高。
      在农业生产大跃进中和人民公社组织形式下，
  人民公社的积累大大增加了
    1958年农村人民公社积累达到一百零一亿元，比1957年农业合作社的积累增长一倍多，相当于第一个五年计划期间个体农民与农业合作社积累总和的一半以上。这一事实有力地证明人民公社在扩大再生产方面具有多么巨大的生命力。
    1958年农村基本建设是从大兴水利工程开始的。根据十七个省的调查，一年来人民公社兴修了大、中、小型各种水库共二十四万多个，当年蓄水一百四十六亿立方米。这些工程经过今年特大洪水的实际考验，绝大部分都是良好的，仅有极小部分（约占3.2％）质量不太好。1958年底，我国水利灌溉的面积已达十亿亩，占全国耕地面积的比重，已由1957年的30.7％提高到60％以上。右倾机会主义分子硬说水利化搞糟了，得不偿失，显然是无耻的污蔑。
    随着农田水利建设的扩大，农村人民公社所拥有的农田排灌机械也有很大的增加。1958年底全国人民公社共拥有排灌机械一百六十万马力，水力发电设备十五万瓩，其中仅1958年就增加了排灌机械一百多万马力，水力发电设备十三万瓩。所有这一切，都大大地提高了我国农村人民公社抗拒水旱灾害的能力，极大地增强了与自然灾害作斗争的物质基础。
    1958年在积累扩大的基础上，人民公社增加了大量的农业机械设备和新式农具以及化肥、农药等。1958年全年，农村人民公社新增加的主要农业机械设备、运输工具和新式农具等，共值十七亿元，比1957年的五亿六千万元增加两倍以上，相当于第一个五年计划期间增加总额的60％左右。1958年末农村人民公社主要生产资料增长情况如下：
                       1957年末数          1958年末数特制水车（万部）        181.8                   264双轮带铧犁（万部）       164                    227联合收割机（台）        1，657                3，500
    由于1958年农业机械设备和新式农具的增加，每一劳动力的技术装备水平，也有很大的提高。每一劳动力的技术装备（农业机械设备和农具）比1957年提高13.3％，而第一个五年计划期间每年平均提高3.3％。这就保证了农业劳动生产率的增长，1958年农业劳动生产率比上一年增长了26％左右，这标志着我国历史上所遗留下来的农业生产技术落后的状况正在迅速改变。这是一个具有历史意义的伟大变化。
    随着人民公社生产建设的发展，公社集体生活福利事业建设也有很大增长。1958年底全国农村共建立了公共食堂三百四十多万个，敬老院十五万所，各种托儿组织三百四十多万个。公社公共福利事业的发展，使几千万农村妇女从繁琐的家务劳动中解放了出来。同时，农村文化卫生事业，也发展很快，1958年底人民公社举办的文化馆将近六万个，俱乐部五十多万个，业余剧团十三万多个。据卫生部初步统计，1959年上半年每个公社都建立了卫生院（医院）一个或几个，生产大队设立了卫生所、产院，多数生产队和自然村设有卫生室。我国农村以人民公社为中心的卫生工作网已经基本形成。
    在工农业各项生产飞速发展的基础上，文化教育事业也获得了飞跃发展，各地先后掀起了规模空前的扫盲运动，全国扫除文盲四千万人，超过了过去九年的扫盲总数。各地建立了无数的业余小学、业余中学、业余大学、红专学校和文化技术学校，并且比较普遍地建立了科学研究组织。在贯彻勤工俭学、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针下，各地建立了新型的农业学校，这对提高农村文化和技术水平，促进生产力的发展，具有很大的作用。
    1958年农村人民公社建设的扩大和公共积累的增加，使1958年人民公社国民收入中积累和消费的比重发生了显著的变化。积累的比重由上一年的10％提高到18.2％，消费的比重由上一年的90％相对下降为81.8％。这一分配比重的变化，不仅对于提高人民生活，加强人民公社的扩大再生产力量，是十分有利的，而且对于人民公社由集体所有制逐步向全民所有制过渡，也具有十分重要的意义。这充分显示了人民公社的巨大优越性。
    以上是人民公社在短短的一年时间内所获得的伟大的光辉的成就。
    右倾机会主义分子对人民公社攻其一点，不及其余，只见树木，不见森林，注定要遭到可耻的失败，而且现在已经失败了。
    现在人民公社正如旭日东升，光芒普射，正越来越强烈地发出它巨大的热力和灿烂的光芒，全国人民都在高呼：
    人民公社万岁！
