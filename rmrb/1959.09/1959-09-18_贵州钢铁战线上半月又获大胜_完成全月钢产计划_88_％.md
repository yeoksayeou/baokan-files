Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 17th - Guizhou completed 88% of its monthly steel production plan in the first half of September, exceeding the same period in the high-yield August by more than 60%, and the quality of the steel also improved. The workers have proposed to complete the annual steel production plan two and a half months ahead of schedule.

Since the beginning of September, the workers of factories and workshops in Guizhou Province with steelmaking tasks have meticulously discussed and formulated measures to ensure the overfulfillment of the September steel production plan, further setting off a socialist competition upsurge of catching up with each other, learning from each other, and cooperating with each other. Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant, which undertakes the main task of steelmaking in the province, closely cooperated in all sections. The furnace front helped the furnace back, and ironmaking ensured steelmaking. The output of each shift in the first workshop increased from eleven or twelve furnaces in August to fourteen or five furnaces. The workers in the second workshop created the highest daily output level of 27.6 tons of half-ton small converters on the first day of September. Class B of the steelmaking workshop of Guiyang Central Foundry had been lagging behind Class A and Class C in August. At the beginning of September, they quickly caught up and caught up with Class A and Class C. On the 4th, the three classes jointly created the highest daily output record of the entire factory. Factories and workshops have also established technical research groups, organized workers to explore equipment capabilities in every possible way, and improved operating techniques to continuously increase steel production while ensuring the quality of the steel. In the past half month, the province's daily steel output has increased by about 200 tons compared to the previous day.

    贵州钢铁战线上半月又获大胜
    完成全月钢产计划88％
    据新华社贵阳17日电　贵州9月上半月完成了全月产钢计划88％，比高产的8月份同期还超产60％以上，钢的质量也提高了。职工们已提出，要提前两个半月完成全年的产钢计划。
    进入9月以来，贵州省有炼钢任务的工厂、车间的职工们，细致地讨论和制定了保证超额完成9月份产钢计划的措施，进一步掀起了你追我赶，互相学习，互相协作的社会主义竞赛热潮。担负全省炼钢主要任务的贵阳钢铁厂，各工段密切配合，炉前帮炉后，化铁保吹炼，第一车间各班钢产量由8月份的十一、二炉上升到十四、五炉，第二车间职工在9月第一天就创造了半吨小转炉日产二十七点六吨的最高日产水平。贵阳中心铸造厂炼钢车间乙班，8月间一直落在甲丙两班后面，9月一开始，他们急起直追，赶上了甲丙两班，4日三个班共同创造了全厂最高的日产纪录。各厂、车间还成立了技术研究小组，组织职工千方百计挖掘设备能力，改进操作技术，在保证钢的质量的基础上不断提高钢的产量。半个月来，全省每天的钢产量都比上一天增加二百吨左右。
