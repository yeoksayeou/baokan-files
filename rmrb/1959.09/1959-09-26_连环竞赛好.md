Continuous Competition is Good
(Excerpts from a Shanxi Daily Editorial)

A continuous battle is raging in the Jinxi Machine Factory. This is a new development in the mass competition movement; it marks a new high tide in the movement to increase production and practice economy, becoming broader, deeper, and more thorough.

The "continuous battle" is actually a mass mobilization, a great promotion, a great collaboration, and a great evaluation. It is a great mobilization because, through this competition, every department, every aspect, every link, and every individual are mobilized without exception to fight for a common goal, forming an overall battle. It is a great promotion because, in the process of fighting for a common goal, everyone must improve comprehensively and rise together. Here, one link is tightly connected to another, and each link is closely related. It does not allow for any weak link or "dead corner" because if one link falls behind, it will affect the whole. Thus, it inevitably forces each link to actively catch up, thereby better connecting the entire production process. It is a great collaboration because, through this competition, departments or links that are ahead can be encouraged to actively help weaker links or backward points, to catch up with themselves, surpass themselves, and advance together. Otherwise, it will affect the balanced development of the entire production. In this way, the spirit of communist collaboration is better promoted. It is a great evaluation because, after such a competition, who is strong and who is weak, who is ahead and who is behind, whether there is a spirit of communist collaboration..., all will be revealed to the public. This encourages the strong to become stronger, the weak to catch up with the strong; the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to help the backward. All these are the new characteristics of the "continuous battle" competition form. These characteristics are precisely adapted to the large-scale production of modernized enterprises. Because the production of modernized enterprises itself is a highly collaborative and closely coordinated whole, it requires the full mobilization of all aspects. Only on the basis of common progress and common improvement can the overall improvement of the enterprise's production technology level be promoted, can the product be complete, and can the state production plan be completed more comprehensively. Judging from the facts of the Jinxi Machine Factory, the "continuous battle" competition has remarkably demonstrated this function.

This great mobilization, great promotion, great collaboration, and great evaluation require further mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses. Because only when the masses rise up, mobilize themselves, promote themselves, participate in the evaluation themselves, and actively collaborate themselves, and completely integrate their actions and desires with the Party's calls and requirements, can the movement to increase production and practice economy be higher and higher, wave after wave. The fact that the Jinxi Machine Factory is vigorously carrying out the "continuous battle" most vividly illustrates that the broad masses of workers have extremely rich creative talents, and how magnificent and magnificent the flames of this competition movement are. Shouldn't those who lack enthusiasm for the mass movement, or who have right-leaning tendencies, be inspired and educated here, and thus completely change their wrong attitude towards the mass movement?

We congratulate the emergence of the "continuous battle" competition form, which has added new branches and leaves to our mass competition movement. Combined with the various competition forms currently appearing in various enterprises, it will make the entire competition movement more surging and promote the movement to increase production and practice economy more deeply.

    连环竞赛好
    山西日报社论摘要
    一场连环大战，正在晋西机器厂如火似荼地开展着。这是群众性竞赛运动又一新的发展；它标志着增产节约运动的新高潮，更广、更深、更透了。
    “连环战”，实际上是一个群众性的大发动，大促进，大协作，大评比。说它是大发动，是因为通过这种竞赛，把各个部门，各个方面，各个环节，各个人，都毫无例外地动员了起来，去为一个共同的目标而战。这样，就形成一个整体战。说它是大促进，是由于大家在为共同目标而战的过程中，必须全面提高，共同高涨。在这里，真是一环紧扣一环，环环密切相连，它不容许有任何一个薄弱环节或
  “死角”。因为一环跟不上，就要影响全局。这样，就必然使每一个环节主动地往前赶，从而使整个生产过程更好地衔接起来。说它是大协作，是由于通过这种竞赛，能促使走在前面的部门或环节，主动地去帮助薄弱环节或落后点，追自己，赶自己，同自己一起前进。否则就要影响整个生产的平衡发展。这样，就使共产主义大协作的精神，得到了更好地发扬。说它是大评比，因为经过这么一赛，谁强谁弱，谁先谁后，有无共产主义大协作的精神……，就都揭示于众了。这样，就促使强者更争强，弱者要赶强；落后者追先进，先进者帮落后。所有这些，就是“连环战”竞赛形式的新特点。这些特点，恰恰与近代化企业的大生产相适应。因为近代化企业生产本身，就是一个高度协作、密切配合的整体，它要求充分地调动起各个方面的积极性；只有在共同前进，共同提高的基础上，才能够促进企业生产技术水平的全面提高，才能保证产品成套，才能更全面地完成国家生产计划。从晋西机器厂的事实来看，“连环战”竞赛，已经卓越地显示了这种功能。
    这种大发动，大促进，大协作，大评比，要求进一步发动群众、依靠群众。因为只有群众起来，自己发动自己，自己促进自己，自己去参加评比，自己去主动协作，把自己的行动和愿望，同党的号召和要求，完全融解在一起，才能使增产节约运动一浪赶一浪，一浪胜一浪。晋西机器厂大搞“连环战”的事实，最生动地说明，广大职工群众有极为丰富的创造才能，而这种竞赛运动的烈火，又是多么气势磅礴，波澜壮阔。那些对待群众运动缺乏热情，或有右倾情绪的人，难道还不应该在这里受到启发，得到教育，从而彻底转变对待群众运动的错误态度吗？
    我们祝贺“连环战”竞赛形式的出现，它为我们的群众竞赛运动又增添了新枝叶，它和当前各企业出现的各种竞赛形式结合起来，将会使整个竞赛运动更加汹涌澎湃，推动增产节约运动更加深入地开展。
