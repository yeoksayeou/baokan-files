Xinhua News Agency, 10th September: The Indian Information Service reported on August 31st: Prime Minister Nehru said in the Council of States on August 31st that contact had now been made with the Indian outpost at Longju, which was surrounded by the Chinese on August 26th; according to the latest intelligence received by the government from them, the Indians who left Longju were now en route and had established an outpost at Garang.

He also said, "It is apparently not clear whether the Chinese patrol has occupied Longju or is merely operating around it."

The Prime Minister made the statement in reply to a question raised at short notice:

"On August 7, 1959, a Chinese armed patrol trespassed into Indian territory in the Kameng Frontier Division of the Northeast Frontier Agency at Khinzemane. They pushed our patrol, which was greatly outnumbered, back one or two miles to the Zhongkun Bridge. On August 14, another Chinese patrol attempted to outflank Khinzemane, but was unsuccessful and later retreated. Since then, we have not received further reports from this area; therefore, it can be assumed that our position on this border remains unaffected.

"On August 25, in another area of the Northeast Frontier Agency, another incident occurred of Chinese troops intruding into Indian territory. This was at a point slightly south of Maza, and slightly past Longju in the Subansiri Frontier Division, where there is an Indian outpost. This Chinese force encountered the Indian outpost and opened fire on them. The Indian outpost consisted of one sergeant and ten riflemen. Our outpost was captured by the Chinese, but later eight of the eleven riflemen managed to escape to our Longju outpost. On August 26, Chinese troops approached Longju and opened fire on our outpost. It appears that our people at this outpost had to abandon their position while being surrounded. We have not received further information about what subsequently happened in this area.

"We immediately protested to the Chinese government about this intrusion of Chinese troops into Indian territory and the firing on our troops. The Chinese government itself has protested to us, based on the claim that our troops intruded into their territory south of Maza and fired on their guards at that location. According to this note from China, the Chinese border guards returned fire in self-defense. The Chinese note also mentioned that they had found the body of an Indian.

"I can add one more sentence: After this reply—the reply I have just read—was drafted, we received some new information from two of our people who left Longju. We have been in contact with them. According to them, our people have been about two days' journey away from Longju and have established an outpost at Garang. It is not clear whether the Chinese patrol has occupied Longju, or is merely operating around it."

A member asked: Have there been any more recent incidents of intrusion? He mentioned a news report that some more outposts belonging to the Assam Rifles had been occupied.

Nehru: We have not received intelligence about this matter; generally speaking, we receive information about the Northeast Frontier Agency fairly quickly, and I imagine those messages are incorrect.

In answering another question, Nehru said: It is almost impossible for me to tell the Council of States what military or similar steps we have taken on this issue. It is impossible to prevent intrusion activities along a border of two thousand miles, if I may say so. But it is possible to take certain steps to repel such intrusion activities or to strengthen our defenses. But the Council of States should remember that, although we of course have a responsibility to defend our borders and strengthen them, thereby protecting the integrity of India, generally speaking, large countries do not suddenly and fully engage in war as if war has broken out between them. People will consider these matters, and they will try to resolve issues through discussion and other means. At the same time, people will defend themselves when attacked. For China or India, it makes practically no difference whether one or two miles of land in the mountains belongs to them or to us. However, it is indeed of great significance if treaties are violated or aggressive attitudes are adopted. In places where these problems occur, we must adopt a dual policy, on the one hand, of course, defending ourselves, and on the other, always resolving these issues through meetings.

A member: Does the Indian government consider this unprovoked intrusion into our territory by China to be a friendly act?

Nehru: At first glance, this behavior does not seem very friendly.

One questioner wanted to know about the eight people who escaped from Longju. In answering this question, the Prime Minister said: I have just said that contact has been made with two of them, and they have provided us with some information. I am not entirely clear where the remaining six are. They may be with our other people. It is very difficult. We can get information from the outposts, but people between the two outposts cannot send messages.

A member: I would like to know, on the issue of this specific territory where the Chinese intrusion occurred, is there any doubt about the ownership of this area, or are we sure it belongs to us?

Nehru: Yes, the Chinese not only doubt it, but also claim that the area belongs to them. I don't know to what extent this is correct, but they claim to own the area and told our people that the area belongs to them. Whether they are justified in doing so is another matter.

A member of parliament asked: Can the Prime Minister explain the reasons why the Chinese have taken such aggressive actions in these areas at this time?

Nehru said: This is obviously a matter that can only be speculated upon. First, I would like to distinguish the situation in the northeast from the situation in Ladakh. The situation in Ladakh is different from the Northeast Frontier Agency and the situation of these borders. All these borders are part of the so-called McMahon Line. If you accept the McMahon Line, then you accept that long border stretching from Burma all the way to Nepal. That does not apply to the Ladakh border. The Ladakh border has been under the jurisdiction of Jammu and Kashmir for many years; no one knows exactly what the situation is there, although some British officers went there a hundred years ago and drew a line that the Chinese did not accept. This issue is obviously one that needs to be considered and discussed, but it does not apply to this area. Here there is the McMahon Line; there is no doubt that in our view this is a clear act of aggression. Why they did this, I naturally cannot say for certain. It can only be speculated upon.

The Indian Information Service also reported: Prime Minister Nehru rejected in the Council of States on August 31 a suggestion from the opposition party that it would be appropriate to consider blowing up the Yecheng-Gartok highway, which the Chinese had built through a section of Indian territory within Ladakh.

Nehru said that the government would not consider this approach "because the government does not wish to act in that way on such issues." India claims that that part of the area belongs to it because the evidence is in its favor. But the Chinese have also produced their own maps, just as old, that are in their favor. This area is known as "barren, uninhabited wasteland."

He said that decisions on such issues can only be made through meetings and reaching consensus. Then he added: "No country would, and should not, go to war on such issues without taking other measures."

The Prime Minister said on August 31 in the Council of States, in response to a question raised at short notice concerning the Chinese construction of a highway in Ladakh:

According to the announcement made by China, the Yecheng-Gartok highway, also called the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway, was completed in September 1957. Someone once drew our attention to a very small map published in a Chinese newspaper showing the approximate location of this route, a map that was about two and a quarter inches long and one and three-quarters inches wide. From this small map, it was impossible to tell whether the highway passed through Indian territory, although it seemed as if it did. Therefore, it was decided at that time to send a reconnaissance team the following summer to find out the route of this highway. Thus, two reconnaissance teams were sent out last year. One of the teams was detained by a Chinese force that was in a superior position. The other team returned and gave us a rough description of the new highway in the Aksai Chin area. According to their report, the highway enters Indian territory near the southern part of Lake Shalujili, then extends northwest and leaves Indian territory near Haji Langar in the northwestern corner of Ladakh.

In a note that we handed to the Chinese ambassador in New Delhi on October 18, 1958, we raised the issue with the Chinese government, drawing their attention to the construction of a highway through Indian territory and the arrest of fifteen members of an Indian reconnaissance team within India. The Chinese government informed us in a reply note submitted on November 1, 1958, that these people had been released and claimed that the highway passed through Chinese territory. On November 8, 1958, we submitted another note to the Chinese authorities, expressing surprise at the Chinese claim. Subsequently, we reminded them of this matter again. We have not received any further replies.

The general altitude of the Aksai Chin area is above 17,000 feet.

As a result of the treaty signed in 1842 representing the side of Governor Gulab Singh and the Guru Sahib Lama of Lhasa—that is the name written in the agreement I quoted—and the representative of the Chinese Emperor on the other side, the entire Ladakh area, including Aksai Chin, became part of Jammu and Kashmir. Since then, this area has been part of Jammu and Kashmir. Later, British officers repeatedly attempted to delineate the boundary between Jammu and Kashmir and Tibet. The Chinese government was asked to send representatives to cooperate in doing this work. They did not participate. However, the Chinese Commissioner made the following statement on January 13, 1847:

"Allow me to point out that the boundaries of these areas have been fully and clearly delineated, and therefore it is best to abide by this ancient arrangement, and the facts will prove that it would be much easier not to take any other measures to delineate the boundaries."

British officers also held this view. Although no actual boundary lines were drawn on the ground, maps were drawn based on ancient customs and practices. For roughly the past hundred years, these maps have been used in India. They include the Aksai Chin area as part of Ladakh. Because the Aksai Chin area's boundary with China-Tibet was not delineated on the ground, the question of the precise demarcation of this boundary has arisen once or twice. Old Chinese maps show different boundaries.

Someone asked why the situation had not been explained to parliament earlier, and Nehru said:

There was not much to explain, it was—I give the date—about last November, when we protested, and then sent letters reminding them. In this regard, it is obviously particularly suitable to carry out some kind of consultation and make a decision on the facts, because the facts are very complicated, and the Chinese claim that area as theirs. In fact, they did not let us know that they had built a highway in that extremely remote corner, and we have been handling this matter through correspondence. There was no special situation that required bringing the matter to parliament, because we believed that we might make progress through correspondence, and when the time was right, we would inform parliament.

A member: Given that China claims that this territory, which is recognized as Indian territory, is within their borders, and that we protested as early as July or August 1958, given that the Chinese claim is unfounded and no response has been given to the Indian government, is the government considering using force to drive the Chinese out of this Indian area? Is the Indian government at least considering whether it would be appropriate to blow up the highway built in our territory?

Nehru: No, the government will not consider doing that, because the government does not wish to act in that way on such issues. The members began by saying that this is recognized Indian territory, but the Chinese would not agree with that. There is a contradiction in the statement. In fact, it is Indian territory, and we declare it is Indian territory because we believe that the evidence is in our favor, with maps, etc. But the Chinese have also produced their own maps, just as old, that are in their favor. This area is barren. It is called barren, uninhabited wasteland, at an altitude of 17,000 feet. In places like these, decisions can only be made through meetings, through agreements. No country would, and should not, go to war on such issues without taking other measures.

A member: Since the Chinese government has not even responded to our protest made as early as around August, what should we do?

Nehru: The date raised by the member is not entirely correct. They did make a response, and we have also responded to that response.

Speaker: The last time was on November 8, 1958. Have you sent them any letters after that?

Nehru: After that, we sent them letters reminding them, and they did not respond to this. That is the fact.

A member: Despite the letters reminding them, they have not responded?

Nehru: Despite these letters. We can only send letters reminding them again.

Another member: Before they responded, was the construction of the highway stopped?

Speaker: I think the road has already been built.

Nehru: The road has been built. Roads in these areas are a special kind of road. In these high-altitude areas, the ground is very hard, even harder than ordinary cement. When you build a road, you just have to level the ground a little and clear away stones and bushes. I can't even say now when the road was built. But as I said, the news about it came from a small Chinese map two years ago. From the Chinese point of view, another question has also arisen, that is, whether it is part of Chinese Xinjiang or part of Tibet. Because according to some Chinese statements, according to some old statements made later, it belongs to Chinese Xinjiang.

A member asked if there were still people being detained by China.

Nehru: No, sir.

Speaker: They have all been released.

Another member: Has the government received any further reports indicating that the Chinese have expanded their occupied area and controlled a larger area than we had information about when we received the information about the construction of this highway?

Nehru: Not about that area, that is different. There is no problem about that. There were reports this month (August), not about this area, but near Ladakh, quite far from this area, in the area bordering Tibet in eastern Ladakh. There, a reconnaissance team in that area—a small Indian patrol—saw Chinese troops; as a result, I think seven, eight, or ten people—I don't remember the number—were captured by the Chinese, and then released later. The same statement arose here: they said that this was their territory, and we said that this was ours. As I said this month, the issue has arisen. We are corresponding about that territorial issue. These places are not demarcated on the ground. We rely on our maps, and the Chinese do not recognize these maps. They probably rely on their maps, whatever maps they have. According to our maps, the Chinese patrol came in four, five, maybe seven or eight miles, I'm not too sure. We learned that they have established small checkpoints just inside the international border, in our area, not far from the border, in the area bordering Tibet in eastern Ladakh. This is near a place called Chushul, near that place, we have a checkpoint of our own?

Nehru said in reply to another question: I am only talking about the Yecheng area and not about the whole of Ladakh, although generally speaking, the height of the whole of Ladakh is between 11,000 and 17,000 and 20,000 feet. The Chinese probably attach great importance to this area because this route connects part of Chinese Turkestan with Gartok-Yecheng. This is an important connection.

A member of parliament asked: Does the government have any checkpoints on that Ladakh border?

The Prime Minister said: We have some checkpoints. For example, the checkpoint I just mentioned called Chushul. This is not just a checkpoint, but also a temporary airport, about four years ago, I happened to go there.

Another member of parliament asked: Have the Chinese entered and occupied some Indian territories on the Uttar Pradesh-Tibet border near Almora?

Nehru: "Not to our knowledge."

### 八月三十一日在印度联邦院中  尼赫鲁大谈“中国侵入印度领土”

    八月三十一日在印度联邦院中
    尼赫鲁大谈“中国侵入印度领土”
    新华社10日讯　印度新闻处8月31日报道：尼赫鲁总理8月31日在联邦院说，现在已经同在8月26日被中国人包围的印度朗久前哨站的人进行过联系；根据政府从他们那里收到的最新情报，离开朗久的那批印度人现在已经在途中在加伦建立了前哨站。
    他还说：“中国巡逻队究竟是占领了朗久，还是仅仅是在那里周围活动，这一点显然还不清楚。”
    总理在回答一个临时提出的问题时发表的谈话中说：
    “1959年8月7日，中国武装巡逻队在东北边境特区卡门边境区的坚则马尼越界进入印度领土。他们把我们的人数大大处于劣势的巡逻队推回了一两英里，一直推到仲昆桥。8月14日，另一支中国巡逻队试图从侧面包围坚则马尼，但是没有成功，后来他们撤退了。自从那时以来，我们没有从这个地区接到进一步的报告；因此可以认为，我们在这条边界上的地位依然没有受到影响。
    8月25日，在东北边境特区的另一个地区，发生了另一次中国人入侵印度领土的事件。这是在苏班西日边区马及墩南面一点、朗久稍微过去一点的地方，在朗久那里有印度的前哨站。这支中国队伍遇到了印度的前哨队，并且向他们开了火。这支印度前哨队由一名军士和十名步枪手组成。我们的前哨队被中国人抓去了，但是后来十一个步枪手中有八个人设法逃到了我们的朗久前哨站。8月26日，中国军队开近朗久，并且朝我们的前哨站开了火。看来我们在这个前哨站里的人在被包围的时候不得不放弃他们的阵地。关于这个地区随后发生的情况，我们没有得到进一步的情报。
    我们立即就中国军队这次侵入印度领土和向我们的部队开火的事件向中国政府提出了抗议。中国政府自己曾经向我们提出抗议，他们的根据是，据说我们的军队侵入马及墩以南的他们的领土，并向他们在这个地方的守卫部队开火。根据中国的这份照会，中国边防部队为了自卫而还了火。中国的这份照会里还提到他们发现了一具印度人的尸体。
    我可以再补充一句：在这个答复——我刚刚宣读的这个答复——草拟好以后，我们又从离开朗久的我们的两个人那里接到了一点新情报。我们同他们进行了联系。据他们说，我们的这批人已经离开朗久大约有两天的路程，并且已经在加伦建立了前哨站。中国巡逻队究竟是占领了朗久，还是仅仅是在朗久周围活动，这一点还不清楚。”
    一位议员问：最近是不是又发生了一些入侵事件？他提到报上的一则消息，这则消息说，又有一些属于阿萨姆步枪队的前哨站被占领了。
    尼赫鲁：关于这个问题，我们没有收到情报；总的说来，关于东北边境特区的情报，我们得到得相当快，我想像那些消息是不正确的。
    在回答另一个问题的时候，尼赫鲁说：我几乎不可能告诉联邦院，我们在这种问题上已经采取了什么军事的或者这一类的步骤。要防止两千英里长的边界上的入侵活动是不可能的，如果我可以这么说的话。但是采取某些步骤来击退这种入侵活动或者加强我们的防务是可能的。但是联邦院应该记住，虽然我们当然有责任保卫我们的边境并且加强它们，从而保护印度的完整，但是通常就大国来说，人们不会好像它们之间发生了战争一样，突然动手，全面地打起来。人们会考虑这些事情，人们会设法通过讨论等办法来解决问题。同时，人们在受到进攻的时候会进行自卫。对于中国或者印度说来，高山中的一两英里的地方究竟属于他们还是属于我们，实际上显然没有多大差别。但是，如果条约遭到破坏，或者采取了侵略性的态度，那的确是有重大关系的。在发生这些问题的地方，我们必须采取双重的政策，一方面当然是要进行防御，另一方面始终要通过举行会议的办法解决这些问题。
    一位议员：请问印度政府是否认为中国这种无端入侵我国领土的行为是友好的行为？
    尼赫鲁：一眼看去，这种行为似乎不是很友好的。
    有一个提问题的人希望了解从朗久逃出的八个人的情况。在回答这个问题时，总理说：我刚刚说过，已经同他们中间的两个人进行了联系，他们向我们提供了一些情报。我不十分清楚剩下的六个人在哪里。他们可能同我们的其他的人在一起。这是很困难的。我们可以从前哨站那里得到情报，可是在两个前哨站之间的人无法发出讯息。
    一位议员：我想知道，在发生中国人入侵事件的这块具体领土问题上，这一地区的所有权是不是有任何疑问，或者说我们是不是肯定它是属于我们的？
    尼赫鲁：有的，中国人不仅怀疑，而且还声称那一地带归它所有。我不知道这话在多大程度上是正确的，但是他们声称拥有那一地带，并且对我们的人说，那一地带是属于他们的。他们这样做是不是有道理，那是另外一个问题。
    有议员问道：总理是不是能够说明中国人在这个时候在这些地区采取这种侵略行动的原因。
    尼赫鲁说：这显然是一个只能揣测的问题。首先我想把东北方面的情况同拉达克的情况区别开来。拉达克的情况同东北边境特区和这些边界的情况是不同的。所有这些边界都是所谓麦克马洪线的一部分。如果你接受麦克马洪线，那么你就接受从缅甸开始一直到尼泊尔的整个那条很长的边界。那并不适用于拉达克边境。拉达克边境许多年以来一直是在查谟和克什米尔邦的管辖下；没有人确切地知道那里的情况怎样，虽然一百年以前曾经有一些英国军官到那里去过，并且划了一条线，中国人没有接受那条线。这个问题显然是一个需要考虑和讨论的问题，但是那并不适用于这个地区。在这里有麦克马洪线；毫无疑问，在我们看来这是一个明白的侵略事件。他们为什么这样做，我自然无法确切地说明。这只能揣测而已。
    印度新闻处还报道：尼赫鲁总理8月31日在联邦院拒绝了反对党提出的一项建议，这项建议主张考虑炸掉中国所修建的穿过拉达克境内一段印度领土的叶城—噶大克公路是否适宜。
    尼赫鲁说，政府不会考虑这种做法，“因为政府在这种问题上不希望以那样的方式行事”。印度声称那一部分地方是它的，因为证据对它是有利的。但是中国人也拿出了他们自己的同样老的、对他们有利的地图。这个地区被称为“荒芜的、无人居住的不毛之地”。
    他说，关于这种问题的决定只能通过举行会议和取得一致意见的办法作出。接着他又说：“任何国家都不会、也不应当在这种问题上不采取其他办法就进行战争。”
    总理8月31日在联邦院回答有关中国在拉达克修建公路的临时提出的问题的时候说：
    根据中国宣布的消息，叶城—噶大克公路，也叫新藏公路，是在1957年9月建成的。有人曾经要我们注意中国报纸上所刊登的一幅非常小的、说明这条路线的大略位置的地图，这幅地图大约长二又四分之一英寸，宽一又四分之三英寸。从这幅小地图上不可能看出这条公路是不是穿过印度的领土，虽然看来好像是穿过印度的领土。因此当时决定在第二年夏天派遣侦察队去了解这条公路的路线。于是在去年派出了两个侦察队。其中有一个队被中国一支处于优势的部队拘留了起来。另一个队回来了，并且向我们大概说明了阿克赛地区的这条新建的公路的一些情况。根据他们的报告，这条公路在南面靠近沙勒吉里干湖的地方进入印度领土，然后往西北方延伸，在拉达克西北角的哈季朗加附近离开印度领土。
    我们在1958年10月18日在新德里交给中国大使的一项照会中向中国政府提出了意见，请他们注意穿过印度领土修建公路的事情和在印度境内逮捕印度侦察队十五名队员的事情。中国政府在1958年11月1日提出的复照中通知说这批人已经释放，并且声称这条公路经过的是中国的领土。在1958年11月8日我们又向中国当局提出了另一项照会，对中国的说法表示惊奇。随后我们又提醒他们注意。还没有接到进一步的答复。
    阿克赛地区一般的高度在一万七千英尺以上。
    由于在1842年代表古拉布辛大君一方和拉萨的古鲁萨希布喇嘛——这就是我所引述的协定中所写的名字——和中国皇帝的代表另一方签订的条约的结果，整个拉达克地区，包括阿克赛，成为查谟和克什米尔邦的一部分。自从那时以来，这个地区就成为查谟和克什米尔邦的一部分。后来，英国军官曾屡次企图划定查谟和克什米尔邦同西藏之间的边界。曾经要求中国政府派代表合作来做这个工作。他们没有参加。但是，中国专员在1847年1月13日曾发表声明如下：
    “请容许我指出，这些地区的边界已经充分地、明确地划定了，因此最好是遵守这项古老的安排，事实将会证明不再另外采取任何划定边界的措施要方便得多。”
    英国军官也抱有这种看法。虽然没有在地面上划出实际的分界线，可是根据古老的习惯和惯例绘制了地图。在过去约莫一百年的时间内，在印度一直是使用这些地图的。它们包括阿克赛地区，作为拉达克的一部分。由于阿克赛地区同中国—西藏的边界没有在地面上划出来，曾有一次或者两次产生了关于这个边界的确切的界线的问题。中国的旧地图上划着不同的界线。
    有人问，为什么早些时候没有就这个问题向议会说明情况，尼赫鲁说：
    没有多少情况可以说明，这是——我提出日期——大约在去年11月，当时我们提出抗议，后来又发出信件提醒他们。在这方面显然特别适于就事实进行某种协商和作出决定，因为事实是非常复杂的，中国人声称那个地区为他们所有。事实上，他们没有让我们知道就在那个极远的角落修建了公路，我们一直在以通信的方式处理这个问题。没有发生特别的情况需要把这个问题向议会提出，因为我们认为，我们或许可以通过通信取得进展，在时间成熟时，我们就通知议会。
    一位议员：鉴于中国声称这个公认是印度的领土在他们的边界以内，而我们远在1958年7月或者8月就提出了抗议，鉴于中国的说法是没有理由的，而且没有向印度政府提出答复，政府是否考虑用武力把中国人从这个印度地区赶出？印度政府是不是至少要考虑把在我国领土上建筑的公路炸毁是否相宜？
    尼赫鲁：不，政府不会考虑那样做，因为政府在这种问题上不希望以那样的方式行事。议员们一开头就说这是公认的印度的领土，但是中国不会同意这一点。说法上是有矛盾的。事实上它是印度领土，我们宣称它是印度的领土，因为我们认为证据是对我们有利的，有地图等等。但是中国人也拿出了他们自己的同样古老的、对他们有利的地图。这个地区是贫瘠的。它被称为荒芜的、无人居住的不毛之地，高度在一万七千英尺。在像这样的一些地方，只有通过会议、通过协议才能作出决定。任何国家都不会、也不应当在这种问题上不采取其他办法就进行战争。
    一位议员：既然中国政府甚至不答复我们远在8月光景提出的抗议，我们怎么办呢？
    尼赫鲁：议员提出的日期并不完全正确。他们的确作出了答复，我们对这种答复也提出过答复。
    议长：上次是在1958年11月8日，在这以后你是否也向他们发出过甚么信件？
    尼赫鲁：在那以后我们曾经向他们发出信件提醒他们，他们对此没有作出答复。这是事实。
    一位议员：尽管发出了提醒他们的信件，他们也没有答复？
    尼赫鲁：尽管发出了这种信件。我们只能再发出信件提醒他们。
    另一位议员：请问在他们作出答复以前，是否已制止这条公路的修建工作？
    议长：我想路已经修好了。
    尼赫鲁：路修好了。这些地区的路是很特别的一种路。在这些地势很高的地区，地面非常硬，比一般水泥还硬，你在筑路时只要稍为平一平地，清除石块和灌木就行了。我现在甚至说不上，路是什么时候修的。可是正如我所说的，关于它的消息是在两年前从中国小地图上传来的。从中国的观点看来，还产生了另外一个问题，那就是，它究竟是中国新疆的一部分，还是西藏的一部分。因为按照中国的某些说法，按照后来提出的一些老的说法，它属于中国的新疆。
    一位议员问道，现在是否仍然有人被中国拘留。
    尼赫鲁：没有，先生。
    议长：他们已经全部获释了。
    另一位议员：请问政府有没有收到任何进一步的报告，说明中国人扩大了他们的占领区，控制了比我们得到关于修建这条公路的情报时还要大的地区？
    尼赫鲁：不是关于那个地区，那是不同的。关于那一点不存在问题。在本月（8月）有报告，不是关于这个地区，而是在拉达克附近，离这个地区相当远，在拉达克东部同西藏交界的地区。在那里，那个地区的侦察队——印度一支小巡逻队——看见中国部队；结果，我想有七、八个或者十个人——我记不清人数——被中国人俘掳，后来又被释放。这里产生了同样的说法：他们说，这是他们的领土，而我们说，这是我们的。正如我在本月份所说的，问题产生了。我们正在就那个领土问题通信。这些地方在地上没有划定界线。我们依据我们的地图，而中国人不承认这些地图。他们大概依据他们的地图，不管他们拥有的地图是怎样的地图。根据我们的地图，中国巡逻队进来的地方是四、五英里，可能是七、八英里，我不太肯定。我们得悉，他们就在拉达克东部同西藏交界的地区、在国际边界的我们这方面，离边境不远的地方建立小检查站。这是在名叫丘顺的地方附近，在那个地方附近，我们有我们自己的一个检查站？
    尼赫鲁在答复另一个问题时说：我只是在谈叶城地区而不是谈整个拉达克，虽然总的说来，整个拉达克的高度为一万一千到一万七千和二万英尺。中国人大概很重视这个地区，因为这条路线把中国土耳其斯坦的一部分和噶大克—叶城连接起来。这是重要的联系。
    有议员问：政府在那个拉达克边界上有没有甚么检查站？
    总理说：我们有一些检查站。例如，我刚刚提到的名叫丘顺的检查站。这不仅仅是检查站，而且是临时机场，大约在四年前，我偶尔到那里去过。
    另一位议员问：中国人有没有进入和占领在阿尔摩拉附近的北方邦——西藏边界上的一些印度领土？
    尼赫鲁：“就我们所知，没有”。
