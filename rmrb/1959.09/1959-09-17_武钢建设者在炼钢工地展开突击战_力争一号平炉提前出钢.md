Wuhan Steel Builders Launch a Blitz on the Steelmaking Site
Striving for Early Steel Production from No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace

(Our Dispatch) Construction of the Wuhan Steel No. 1 open hearth furnace system is progressing rapidly. Currently, about 85% of the total project workload has been completed, and it has entered the final decisive stage. From September 7th, bricklaying also began in the melting chamber of the open hearth furnace body. The builders are determined to complete the furnace building plan ahead of schedule and strive for early furnace baking and early steel production.

After the completion of the blast furnace on July 2nd, Wuhan Steel concentrated the construction team on the steelmaking site. The builders, recognizing that putting No. 1 open hearth furnace into production ahead of schedule would contribute to the country's goal of producing 12 million tons of steel this year, and that the completion of the No. 1 open hearth furnace system would basically form Wuhan Steel's steelmaking system, are doing everything possible to overcome difficulties, improve project quality, and accelerate construction speed. After the Party Central Committee put forward the fighting task of completing the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the Wuhan Steel builders became even more high-spirited. In a short period of time, the construction of the steelmaking project has made rapid progress. Now, many auxiliary projects distributed around the open hearth furnace, such as the whole-mold yard, ingot stripping bay, material bay, and drop hammer crushing bay, have basically built factory buildings and are installing equipment. In the main factory building, which is entirely steel structure, the steel columns have been installed to the 34th line, and the roof frames are being installed and the roofing is being laid. More than a thousand tons of components of the open hearth furnace body have been installed, and the bricklaying of regenerators and slag pockets has been completed. The commissioning projects of traffic, electricity, water, gas, and coal gas, which are the prelude to production, are also progressing rapidly.

    武钢建设者在炼钢工地展开突击战
    力争一号平炉提前出钢
    本报讯　武钢一号平炉系统的建设进展迅速，目前已完成全部工程量85％左右，进入了最后决战阶段。从本月7日起，平炉本体的熔炼室也开始砌砖。建设者们决心提前完成筑炉计划，力争平炉提前烘炉，提前出钢。
    武钢从7月2日高炉建成以后，将施工队伍集中到炼钢工地。建设者们由于认识到一号平炉提前投入生产，就可为全国今年生产一千二百万吨钢早日贡献力量，而且一号平炉系统的工程建成以后，武钢的炼钢体系就能基本形成，大家都千方百计地战胜困难，提高工程质量，加快建设速度。当党中央提出提前完成第二个五年计划的战斗任务以后，武钢建设者们更是个个意气风发，短时期内，炼钢工程的建设就有了飞速的进展。现在，分布在平炉周围的整模场、脱锭间、材料间、落锤破碎间等许多辅助工程，都基本上建起了厂房，正在安装设备。全部钢结构的主厂房，钢柱已安到第三十四线，正在安房架，铺屋面。平炉本体的一千多吨构件已经安装完毕，并且完成了蓄热室、沉渣室等砌砖工程。作为生产前奏的通车、通电、通水、通气、通煤气工程，进展也很快。
