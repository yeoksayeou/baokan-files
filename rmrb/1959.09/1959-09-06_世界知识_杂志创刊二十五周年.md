Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: The 17th issue of "World Knowledge," published today, features a special column commemorating the 25th anniversary of the magazine's founding, including commemorative articles by several former editors of the magazine, and the "Inaugural Address" from twenty-five years ago.

"World Knowledge" was founded on September 16, 1934, as a specialized publication introducing international political, economic, and cultural knowledge. These commemorative articles illustrate the earth-shattering changes that have occurred in the domestic and international situation since then. In his article, Hu Yuzhi pointed out that the 25-year history proves that the old world is rapidly collapsing, and the new world is rapidly growing. He said: "When the masses of the people grasp the historical laws of human society,... they will unleash infinite wisdom and soaring energy, propelling the giant wheel of history forward at a speed hundreds and thousands of times faster than in the past." In his article entitled "Memories and Blessings," Xia Yan wrote: "1934 was a year of deepest suffering, but at the same time, 1934 was also a turning point in the history of the Chinese revolution. ... Therefore, the day of the founding of 'World Knowledge' is deeply unforgettable in our memory. ... Even twenty-five years later, mentioning 'World Knowledge' evokes a particularly warm feeling in our hearts, simply because this magazine, founded in the bitter cold, heralded the coming spring."

    “世界知识”杂志创刊二十五周年
    据新华社5日讯　今天出版的“世界知识”第十七期上，辟出纪念这个杂志创刊二十五周年的专栏，刊登了过去曾经担任这个杂志编辑的几个人的纪念文章，和二十五年前的“创刊辞”。
    “世界知识”创刊于1934年9月16日，是一个介绍国际政治、经济、文化知识的专门刊物。这些纪念文章，说明今昔的国内外形势发生了翻天复地的变化。胡愈之在文章中指出二十五年的历史证明，旧世界在迅速崩溃，新世界在迅速壮大。他说：“当人民群众掌握了人类社会的历史规律的时候，……就将发挥无穷的智慧和冲天的干劲，推动着历史的巨轮以比过去更高百倍千倍的速度前进。”夏衍在以“回忆与祝福”为题的文章中写道：“1934年是一个苦难最深重的年月，但同时，1934年也是一个中国革命史上具有转折性的时刻。……为此，‘世界知识’创刊的这个日子，在我们的记忆中，是深刻难忘的。……即使在二十五年之后，提起‘世界知识’就会在我们心里引起一种特别亲切的感觉，只因为这个在酷寒中创刊的杂志预告了即将到来的春天。”
