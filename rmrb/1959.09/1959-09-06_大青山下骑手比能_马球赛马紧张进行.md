Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 4th: The first National Games' equestrian and steeplechase events have entered their fourth day, and the polo matches have entered their fifth. In recent days, galloping horses and skilled riders have created a lively atmosphere under Daqing Mountain.

In the past few days of polo matches, the strong Inner Mongolia team and the People's Liberation Army team have been winning consecutively, and they are both expected to compete for the polo championship. Other teams have had mixed results, with Guizhou, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang teams showing rapid improvement in their techniques through dedicated study, drawing attention. In the eight equestrian and steeplechase events that have already been held, the Inner Mongolia team has performed the best, ranking in the top positions in seven events. Among the teams from the south, the Anhui team is particularly eye-catching, having achieved nine rankings in seven events. The female athletes of the Anhui team, known as the "Jiangnan Girls," have only been learning to ride horses for less than a year, but they have already earned five rankings in three events. For example, in the women's Group A 2,000-meter race, they occupied three of the eight total rankings.

On the 3rd and 4th, the men's Group A 5,000-meter and men's Group B 2,000-meter races were held, and the steeplechase events included the women's Group B consecutive obstacle course and the men's Group A wide obstacle course. Twelve polo matches were played.

On the 3rd, the Jilin team stood out in the men's Group A 5,000-meter race, occupying three of the top eight positions, including first place. Gao Fengming of this team is highly skilled. At the beginning, based on his experience in long-distance racing, he only released half of the reins, allowing the horse to maintain a certain speed. When half the race was completed, he released the reins completely, and the horse ran faster and faster, leaving his competitors behind by more than 200 meters. He ultimately won first place with a time of six minutes and fifty-one point seven seconds.

The women's Group B consecutive obstacle course competition was the most intense. Xinjiang athlete Jian Milai (Kazak) took first place, followed by Wang Ronghua (Heilongjiang) in second place, and Quan Yonglian (Guizhou) in third place.

On the 4th, People's Liberation Army athlete Xu Shengde won first place in the men's Group B 2,000-meter race with a time of two minutes and thirty-three point seven seconds. The men's Group A wide obstacle championship was the most captivating. Zhang Zhenlu, an athlete from Hebei Province, initially achieved a score of five meters and fifty-nine centimeters. Li Boxun, an athlete from Anhui Province, actively pursued him, leaving only the two of them to compete for first place. Later, Zhang Zhenlu took the lead again, soaring over the six-meter mark, while Li Boxun also rode his horse and jumped over a width of six meters and twenty-one centimeters. A few minutes later, Zhang Zhenlu created another score of six meters and forty-four centimeters, defeating his opponent and taking first place. Li Boxun was ranked second. The scores of both individuals exceeded the five meters and eighty-nine centimeters achieved in the wide obstacle event at the Second National Games of the People's Liberation Army this year.

    据新华社呼和浩特4日电　第一届全国运动会赛马、障碍赛马今天进入第四天，马球比赛已进入第五天。连日来骏马奔驰，骑手比能，大青山下一片欢腾。
    在几天来的马球比赛中，实力较强的内蒙古队和解放军队都是连战连捷，他们都将有希望争夺这次的马球冠军。其他队都有胜有败，其中贵州、江苏、黑龙江等队比赛中由于钻研学习，技术提高比较快，受到注意。在已举行过的赛马、障碍赛马的八个项目中，成绩最好的是内蒙古队，有七项都列入名次。南方来的代表队中，特别引人注目的是安徽队，已在七个项目中共取得九个名次，被称为“江南姑娘”的安徽队女子运动员们，虽然学习骑马的时间都还不到一年，但她们已在三个项目中争得五个名次，其中像女子甲组二千米赛马总共八个名次中她们即占了三个。
    3、4两日赛马进行了男子甲组五千米、男子乙组二千米，障碍赛马进行了女子乙组超越连续障碍、男子甲组超越宽障碍，马球比赛进行了十二场。
    3日，在男子甲组五千米赛马中，突出的是吉林队，在前八名中占了三名，其中一个是第一名。这个队中有技术熟练的高凤鸣，一开始他根据长距离赛马的经验，只把马缰放了一半，让马保持一定
  速度，等到跑了赛程一半才把马缰全部松开，于是
  马越跑越快，结果把同跑的伙伴，拉下了二百多米，最后以六分五十一秒七的成绩夺得了第一名。
    女子乙组超越连续障碍比赛争夺最为激烈，新疆运动员见米来（哈萨克族）取得第一名，第二名王荣华（黑龙江），第三名全永莲（贵州）。
    4日，解放军队运动员徐胜德在男子乙组二千米的赛马中，以二分三十三秒七的成绩，得到了第一名。男子甲组宽障碍争夺冠军的比赛最引人入胜。河北省运动员张振录首创五米五十九的成绩，安徽省的运动员李伯勋积极追赶，剩下他们俩争夺第一名。后来，张振录又一马当先腾空跳过了六米大关，而李伯勋也乘马而来，又跳过了六米二十一的宽度。几分钟后张振录又创造了六米四十四的成绩，战败了对方，取得了第一名。李伯勋列为第二名。他们两个人的成绩都超过了今年解放军第二届全军运动会宽障碍五米八十九的成绩。（附图片）
