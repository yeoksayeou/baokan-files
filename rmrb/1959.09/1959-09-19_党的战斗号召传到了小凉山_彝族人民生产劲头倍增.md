Xinhua News Agency report: As Xiaoliang Mountain, at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters, anticipates a bountiful harvest, the Party's great call for increasing production and practicing economy has reached this remote mountain area. The Yi people of Ninglang Yi Autonomous County are overjoyed and unanimously respond to the Party's call, proposing to harvest carefully, thresh meticulously, and return every grain to the household.

The Yi people, freed from the shackles of slavery, have learned the techniques of farming under the guidance of Han cadres and experienced minority farmers. As a result, this year's rice, buckwheat, and other crops are growing very well, and the total output of spring crops in the county is estimated to increase by about 40% compared to last year.

During the autumn harvest, the Yi people generally adopted the method of cutting and threshing simultaneously, ensuring that "buckwheat is not left overnight." Because buckwheat easily sheds its grains, they also generally cut "dewy buckwheat," cutting early in the morning and threshing during the day. They threshed buckwheat three times, greatly reducing scattering compared to last year. During the autumn harvest upsurge, many commune members went to work at the first crow of the rooster, not stopping until the day's work was completed. The Yang'anshan Production Team of the Paomaping Commune mobilized more than 100 laborers and harvested 400 mu in five days. Thanks to the great enthusiasm of the masses and good organization, by September 7, more than 20,000 mu of buckwheat had been basically harvested.

    党的战斗号召传到了小凉山
    彝族人民生产劲头倍增
    据新华社讯  当海拔两千多米的小凉山上正是丰收在望的时候，党的增产节约伟大号召传到了这个偏僻山区。宁蒗彝族自治县的彝族人民喜气洋洋，一致响应党的号召，提出要细收细打，颗粒还家。
    挣脱了奴隶枷锁的彝族人民，在汉族干部和有经验的少数民族农民的传授下，已经学会了种庄稼的技术，因而今年的水稻、荞子等作物长得很好，全县大春作物的总产量估计将比去年增加四成左右。
    在秋收中，彝族人民普遍采取边割边打的办法，做到了“倒荞不过夜”。因为荞子容易脱粒，他们还普遍割“露水荞”，清早割，白天打，打荞的时候先后打三道，比去年大大减少了抛撒。在秋收高潮中，不少社员鸡叫一遍就出工，每天的活计做不完不歇手。跑马坪公社羊安山生产队出动了一百多个劳动力，五天时间就收好四百亩。由于群众干劲大，组织得又好，到9月7日，两万多亩荞子就基本收完。
