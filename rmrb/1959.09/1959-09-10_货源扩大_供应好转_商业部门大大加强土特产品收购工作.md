Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: With the rapid development of diversified operations in people's communes and the rapid development of urban and rural handicraft production, commercial departments have greatly strengthened the procurement of native and special products. The total purchase amount of native and special products in the first half of the year increased by 17.1% compared with the same period last year, and it is still continuing to increase recently.

After vigorously organizing sources of goods, the supply of daily sundry goods in more than twenty large and medium-sized cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou has improved. The quantity and variety of daily-use pottery, umbrellas, straw mats, and daily sundry goods and cooking utensils processed from iron, wood, bamboo, rattan, and grass have increased significantly in the market.

In organizing the source of goods, commercial departments have added purchasing points and improved purchasing methods to facilitate the sale of local and special products by the masses as much as possible. Commercial departments in Jiangxi Province have set up specialized or comprehensive agricultural and sideline product purchase and sale outlets in various places, and temporary purchasing stations have been added during market days or material exchange fairs, basically achieving a purchase and sales point in each production brigade of the commune. At the same time, part-time agricultural and sideline product purchasers are set up in natural villages to purchase agricultural, sideline, and special local products on their behalf. Purchasing agents of the Wanshan Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, carry samples with them and go to the villages for roving exhibitions, doing both propaganda and purchasing, with good results. The masses reflected: "The leadership of the Party is really good, the grass and trees in the mountains become treasures, the lives of the members are greatly improved, and the enthusiasm for production leaps forward day by day."

While organizing procurement, commercial departments also help communes formulate production plans for local and special products, arrange labor, provide technical guidance, and provide raw materials, providing support in many ways. The procurement department of Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province, helped communes establish 56 bee farms, 150 straw bag and straw rope factories, and 883 mat weaving and earthen basket factories. They also established specialized teams for hunting, collecting, and grass cutting, which greatly promoted the development of diversified operations. Commercial departments in many areas also organized technical cooperation and exchanged production experience of local and special products by holding technical training classes and on-site meetings.

    货源扩大　供应好转
    商业部门大大加强土特产品收购工作
    据新华社9日电　随着人民公社多种经营和城乡手工业生产的迅速发展，商业部门大大加强了土特产品的收购工作。上半年土特产品的采购总额比去年同期增加了17.1％，近来仍在继续增加。
    经过大力组织货源以后，目前上海、北京、天津、广州等二十多个大中城市的日用杂品供应情况已经好转。市场上日用陶器、雨伞、草席和用铁、木、竹、藤、草等加工的日用杂品和炊事用具，无论数量和花色品种都有显著增加。
    商业部门在组织货源中，增设了采购点，改进了采购方法，以尽量便利群众出售土特产品。江西省商业部门在各地设专业或综合性的农副产品收购门市部，在集市日期或物资交流会期间增设临时收购站，基本上做到在公社每个生产大队中有一个购销点，同时在自然村中设兼职的农副产品采购员，代购农副土特产品。浙江省青田县万山公社供销部采购员，随身带着样品，下村巡回展览，边宣传，边收购，效果很好。群众反映说：“党的领导真正好，山区草木变成宝，社员生活大提高，生产干劲日日跃。”
    在组织收购的同时，商业部门还帮助公社制订土特产品的生产规划，安排劳动力，进行技术指导，以及供应原料，多方面给予支持。黑龙江省五常县采购部门帮助公社建立养蜂厂五十六处，草袋、草绳厂一百五十处，编席子、土篮子厂八百八十三处，还建立了狩猎、采集、打草等专业队，大大促进了多种经营的发展。许多地区的商业部门还通过举办技术训练班和召开现场会议等办法，组织技术协作和交流土特产品的生产经验。
