Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Electric Dispatch: In August, small and medium-sized blast furnaces and converters in Anhui Province created excellent results. Both steel and iron overfulfilled their monthly plans. The average qualified rate of pig iron in the province has been raised to over 83%; among them, the qualified rate of pig iron in Ma'anshan, Bengbu, Fuyang and other places is over 90%. The quality of steel has also been greatly improved, and the qualified rate of steel ingots in the Hefei Steel Plant has reached 94%.

"September must be stronger than August." Under the encouragement of the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers of the iron and steel industry in the province are full of enthusiasm and energy, and are advancing towards the new goal of producing 7,500 tons of pig iron and 1,200 tons of steel per day.

At the beginning of August, Party committees and iron and steel industrial enterprises at all levels in Anhui Province criticized the right-leaning emotions of some cadres. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees, put forward new production targets, and organized competitions between regions. The secretaries of the local prefectural and municipal party committees conscientiously implemented the instructions of the provincial party committee, strengthened their leadership over industrial production such as iron and steel, and grasped it every day, specifically, and comprehensively. For example, the secretary of the Bengbu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in charge of industry not only checked the iron and steel production situation every day and went to the iron and steel plant to specifically solve problems in production, but also grasped ore production and transportation and pig iron testing to ensure that the blast furnace was well-fed and that the quality of pig iron gradually increased. In August, the average utilization coefficient of the twenty-five small blast furnaces in the entire special zone increased from 0.85 in July to 1.1, the average coke ratio decreased to 1.35, the average qualified rate of pig iron reached more than 90%, and the cost was greatly reduced. After launching a competition against each other, the iron and steel workers in Ma'anshan increased steel production by more than 1,000 tons in the middle ten days of the month compared with the first ten days.

    安徽钢铁工业职工干劲十足  向日产七千五百吨生铁进军
    新华社合肥电　安徽省中小型高炉和转炉生产8月份创造了优异的成绩。钢和铁都超额完成了月计划。全省生铁合格率平均已提高到83％以上；其中，马鞍山、蚌埠、阜阳等地的生铁合格率都在90％以上。钢的质量也大大提高，合肥钢厂钢锭合格率达到94％。
    “9月定比8月强”，全省钢铁工业职工在党的八届八中全会伟大号召的鼓舞下，情绪十分饱满，干劲更加充沛，正在向新的奋斗目标——日产生铁七千五百吨、钢一千二百吨前进。
    8月初，安徽省各级党委和钢铁工业企业，批判了部分干部中的右倾情绪。中共安徽省委召开了地委、市委书记会议，提出新的生产指标，组织地区之间的竞赛。各地委、市委书记都认真贯彻省委的指示，加强了对钢铁等工业生产的领导，做到天天抓，具体抓，全面抓。如中共蚌埠地委管工业的书记，不仅天天检查钢铁生产情况，到钢铁厂去具体解决生产中的问题，还抓矿石生产和调运以及生铁化验工作，保证高炉吃饱吃好，使生铁质量步步上升。8月份，全专区二十五个小高炉的平均利用系数从7月的零点八五提高到一点一，焦比平均下降到一点三五，生铁合格率平均达到90％以上，成本大大降低。马鞍山的钢铁职工在展开对手竞赛以后，使中旬比上旬增产了一千多吨钢。
