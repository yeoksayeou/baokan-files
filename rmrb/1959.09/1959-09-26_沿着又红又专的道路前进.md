Advancing Along the Path of Redness and Expertise
Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society

On October 1, 1949, the solemn five-star red flag was raised over Tiananmen Square, and Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, declared to the world the founding of the People's Republic of China. Six hundred and fifty million hard-working, brave, and intelligent people overthrew extremely powerful enemies and stood up. The democratic revolution that had lasted for more than a hundred years since the Opium War of 1840 finally achieved the most glorious results under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China. The history of the motherland began a new era, a new era of the people being masters of their own house.

Ten years have passed since that great day. The face of the motherland has undergone tremendous and fundamental changes that were unimaginable ten years ago. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have not only achieved a decisive victory in the earth-shaking socialist revolution, but also carried out a world-shaking socialist construction, leaping forward at an accelerated pace with giant strides. Last year was the ninth year after the national liberation. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, production developed by leaps and bounds. The whole people engaged in steelmaking, doubling production, and coal production surpassed that of the old-line imperialist country, Britain. Due to the universal establishment of people's communes in rural areas across the country to meet the needs of the people, agricultural production achieved unprecedented huge growth. This year, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we will basically complete the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Celebrating National Day in such a continuous great leap forward makes us even more excited.

The members of the Jiusan Society are intellectuals working in the fields of science and technology, culture and education, and medicine and health. We have experienced tremendous changes in these ten years. Under the guidance of the Party, we have also continuously made progress in our thinking and achieved success in our work. Our personal feelings about the glorious achievements of the country and the wise leadership of the Party over the past ten years are particularly profound.

Since liberation, the large-scale development of national construction, the continuous rise in the living standards of the people, the great improvement of China's international status, and especially the vigorous development of scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings, which are most dear to intellectuals, have made us extremely happy and inspired. We older intellectuals have fresh memories of the suffering of the motherland before liberation. The rapid economic recovery in the early days of liberation made us cheer for our own people's country. The Party and the People's Government's kind concern for intellectuals moved us greatly. In particular, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, which struck the world's number one imperialist, the United States, made all patriotic intellectuals proud of the Chinese people's pride and washed away the sense of national inferiority, making them love our new country. In our various positions, we have directly witnessed the unprecedented development of various undertakings that were only ideals or even dreams. The number, quality, and scale of institutions of higher learning have advanced by leaps and bounds. Under the guidance of the Party's educational policy, the quality of teaching has continuously improved, and the number of students has increased exponentially. In some departments, the number of graduates in one year exceeded the total number of graduates in the decades before liberation. Cutting-edge sciences in the world, such as the peaceful use of atomic energy, semiconductors, radio electronics, and automatic control, which previously could only be studied abroad and by a small number of people, have now been established as departments or majors in universities. The scattered and fragmented scientific research institutions before liberation have expanded into huge, rich, and nationally needed scientific research bases in just a few years. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the establishment of scientific research institutions in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions has sprung up like mushrooms after rain, demonstrating the correctness of the Party's policy of "walking on two legs." Many scientific departments have undergone amazing development with the needs of production and the active participation of the people. Countless young teams are spread across the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, engaged in exploring underground resources, mapping the face of the earth, exploring changes in the air, and researching and transforming biological habits. These are all situations that we could not have imagined before liberation. Basic sciences such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry have been universally promoted by the state, and the rapid development of applied sciences such as engineering technology, agriculture, forestry, and medicine and health can be imagined. Under the guidance of the truth of Marxism-Leninism, natural science has undergone unprecedented changes in connection with production practice. Social science has fundamentally changed its nature. Over the past ten years, every senior scientist who has seen the growing number of young people around him and seen his research in the study and laboratory no longer just for personal research of literature, but to serve the motherland's large-scale construction, recalling the hard work in the decades before liberation under the reactionary rule, how can he not be excited and motivated by the rebirth of the motherland?

Since liberation, every achievement in the construction of the motherland, as well as every leap forward in the quality and quantity of scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings, has educated and inspired us. At the same time, we cannot help but investigate the reasons and feel that we must solve the relationship between science and politics. The situation of always claiming to be detached from politics and burying oneself in books began to be broken from the beginning of liberation, but it still takes a long time to solve the problem ideologically. The Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals has changed our past erroneous idea of ​​science for science's sake, and gradually recognized the basic principle of serving the people. From the "Three-Anti" movement to the anti-Rightist struggle and the "Double-Anti" movement, a series of major victories in mass political and ideological struggles have gradually moved us away from the influence of decadent bourgeois ideas and various pseudo-sciences, and turned to the proletarian viewpoint and the truth of Marxism-Leninism. "Politics in command" and "both red and expert" have now been accepted by everyone and have become the goals of our efforts to transform ourselves.

The slogan "Learn from the Soviet Union" has played a great role in improving our thinking in practice. Many comrades in the Jiusan Society who are engaged in scientific work were mostly familiar with the scientific situation in capitalist countries in the past, and therefore regarded the path of bourgeois scientists as the only path. Only by learning from the advanced science of the Soviet Union did we broaden our horizons, gradually distinguish the two paths in scientific undertakings, and recognize the relationship between science and socialism. Since the Soviet Union's artificial satellites and space rockets have been successfully launched repeatedly, we have unanimously cheered the great victory of Soviet science, which is guided by Marxism-Leninism and follows the socialist road. The exemplary behavior of Soviet experts working diligently and selflessly for the people's cause in our country and their lofty internationalist spirit have moved many of our comrades who worked with them, and they have worked hard to learn from them. After many people came into contact with these scientists with communist moral qualities, they compared them with scientists from Britain and the United States who were permeated with bourgeois ideas, and further realized the path they should take, and strengthened their enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet Union and their determination to thoroughly transform themselves.

The young masses around us have also had a profound impact on our original ideas. The young people's infinite loyalty to the guidance and teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, their enthusiasm for socialist construction, their firm will to fight against hostile elements and decadent ideas, their courage to quickly correct their shortcomings and mistakes, their sensitivity to new things and their strong desire for knowledge, their collectivist spirit of relying on the masses, and their communist style of daring to think, speak, and act are constantly improving under the education of the Party. Especially in the Great Leap Forward last year, they enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution, and showed their ambition to bravely undertake arduous construction undertakings and realize the great ideals of the Party and Chairman Mao. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of all parties, they have made outstanding achievements. Seeing such a young team growing day by day, how can we not be happy that there are successors and that the younger generation surpasses the older generation? Feeling the deep expectations of these young people for the older generation of scientists, how can we not recall our mood in our youth and become more energetic? Ten years of planting trees, peaches and plums in the shade, from the new young generation cultivated by the Party and connected with the working people, we see the glorious future of the motherland, and we are even more motivated to serve socialism.

The Party has always been incomparably concerned about our intellectuals, not only giving us appropriate arrangements and active assistance in our lives and work, but also giving us countless opportunities to experience new social life and participate in production practice and revolutionary struggles, so that our body and mind have received the most needed nutrition. Through various visits, we came into contact with the vast working people who are working selflessly and the most beloved people who bravely defend the motherland - the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army. We saw the heroes of the old revolutionary bases and heard countless touching heroic deeds. We gained education in class struggle by participating in land reform; we improved our understanding of socialism by visiting agricultural cooperatives and people's communes. A large number of water conservancy projects, a large number of newly built factories, and the vigorous development of science, culture, and education have all deeply educated us intellectuals. We have a rich political life in China, allowing us to understand the current situation and the Party and the country's policies; sometimes when we go abroad, we also see with our own eyes the booming achievements of the great Soviet Union and other brother countries, and meet progressive people in the international community who are working for world peace and democracy. All this has enabled us to continuously change our thinking and improve our understanding in life practice and social practice; and what excites us the most is the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune Movement last year. Immediately after the end of the rectification movement, we personally experienced this unprecedented miracle. The negative elements in our thinking have decreased, and the positive elements have increased. Everyone actively participated in physical labor within their capacity, and strived to realize the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants. As a result, many people have undergone even greater changes than before, and resolutely demanded that they become working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert. Ten years of work and social life practice have promoted our ideological changes. Countless examples before our eyes and one personal experience after another have shown that in order to better serve socialist construction, we must continue to thoroughly transform ourselves. As a result, we have strengthened our determination and confidence in further transformation, and have formulated personal red and expert plans to urge our progress.

Over the past ten years, in the face of so many great achievements, we cannot help but ask: Why can we achieve this? Why can the people of the motherland suddenly liberate such endless potential and create so many earth-shattering miracles? Why can our industrialization speed far exceed that of capitalist countries? There is no doubt that this is due to the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system, the infinite wisdom and strength of the broad masses of the people, the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and our most respected great leader Chairman Mao, and the great power of the guiding ideology of our country - the invincible Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao's creative integration of Marxism-Leninism with China's revolutionary practice is the source of all victories. In the future, we must work harder to study, sincerely and actively accept the leadership of the Party, put politics in command, go all out, and fully contribute to serving socialist construction.

In the long history, ten years is only a short process, but our great motherland has created miracles in these short ten years. Not only can the progress of the past thousands of years of feudal society not be compared with today, but also the development of all capitalist countries cannot be compared. Due to the Great Leap Forward last year and the continued leap forward this year, we have achieved the progress of industrialization that capitalist countries could only achieve in the past few decades in just one or two years. Completing the Five-Year Plan in two years and catching up with Britain in about ten years is the expression of the heroic spirit of the 650 million people under the leadership of the Party. We are deeply fortunate to live in this era and to see the sun of communism shining on the earth. We must redouble our efforts to transform ourselves and participate in the great cause of transforming the world. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, our 650 million people will surely continue to build the motherland into a prosperous and strong great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture at a leaping high speed.

    沿着又红又专的道路前进
    九三学社主席　许德珩
    1949年10月1日天安门上升起了庄严的五星红旗，我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席向全世界宣告中华人民共和国成立。六亿五千万勤劳、勇敢、智慧的人民推翻了极其强大的敌人，站起来了。从1840年鸦片战争以来一百多年来的民主革命，终于在伟大的中国共产党领导下，获得了最光辉的成果。祖国的历史开始了新的纪元，开始了人民当家作主的新时代。
    从这一个伟大的日子到现在已经是十周年了。祖国的面貌有了十年前想像不到的极其巨大的根本变化。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我国人民不但取得了翻天复地的社会主义革命的决定性胜利，而且进行了震动世界的社会主义建设事业，以巨人般的步伐向前加速度地跃进。去年是全国解放后第九年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，生产飞跃发展。全民炼钢，产量翻了一番，煤产量超过了老牌帝国主义英国；由于全国农村普遍建立了适合人民需要的人民公社，农业生产获得了史无前例的巨大增长。今年庆祝建国十周年，我们就要提前三年基本上完成第二个五年计划。在这样的继续不断的大跃进中欢欣鼓舞地庆祝国庆，更使我们万分兴奋。
    九三学社的成员是在科学技术、文化教育、医药卫生岗位上工作的知识分子。我们在这十年中，经历了极大的变化，在党的教导下，也不断地取得了思想上的进步和工作中的成绩。从我们的亲身感受来体会十年来国家的辉煌成就和党的领导的英明，就感觉到格外的深刻。
    解放后，国家建设的大规模展开，人民生活水平的不断上升，我国国际地位的大大提高，尤其是知识分子最感亲切的科学文教事业的蓬勃发展，都使我们万分欢欣鼓舞。我们这些年龄较大的知识分子，对解放前祖国的苦难，是记忆犹新的。解放初期，经济上的迅速恢复，使我们为人民自己的国家欢呼，党和人民政府对知识分子的亲切关怀，使我们受到极大的感动，尤其是抗美援朝战争，打击了世界上头号帝国主义美国，更使一切爱国的知识分子为祖国人民的扬眉吐气而感到自豪，洗涤了民族自卑感，热爱我们的新国家。我们在各个不同岗位上，又直接见到了从来只是理想的，甚至许多是从来梦想不到的各方面事业的空前大发展。高等学校的数量、质量和规模突飞猛进，在党的教育方针指导下，教学质量不断提高，学生数量成倍地增长，有的系科，一年毕业生的人数就超过了解放前几十年全部毕业生的总和。世界上尖端科学如和平利用原子能、半导体、无线电电子学、自动控制等，以前只有到外国去学而且人数寥寥，现在却已经在大学中设立系或专业。解放前七零八落、支离破碎的科学研究机构，几年间就扩大成为巨大、丰富而切合国家需要的科学研究基地。去年大跃进以来各省、市、自治区的科学研究机构的建立更如雨后春笋，显示了党的用“两条腿走路”的方针的正确。许多科学部门，随着生产需要和人民群众的积极参加，都有了惊人的发展。数不清的青年队伍，遍布在祖国的锦绣山河上，从事于勘探地下资源，测绘大地面貌，探究空中变化，研究和改造生物习性。这都是解放前我们想不到的情况。基础科学如数学、物理、化学等普遍受到国家的大力推动，工程技术、农、林、医药卫生等应用科学的飞跃发展更可以想见了。在马克思列宁主义真理的指导之下，自然科学联系生产实际起了空前变化。社会科学更是根本改变了性质。十年来，每一个年长的科学工作者见到在自己周围逐年增加的青年队伍，看到自己在书斋和实验室中的研究，不再是只为个人钻研文献，而是为祖国的大规模建设事业服务，回想到解放前几十年在反动统治下的艰苦工作情况，如何能不为祖国的新生而心情激动，奋发有为？
    解放后，祖国的每一项建设的成就，以及科学文教事业在质量和数量方面的每一跃进，都给我们以教育和鼓舞，同时也不能不使大家追究其原因而感到必须解决科学和政治的关系的问题。一向自命为脱离政治而埋头书本的情况，从解放当初就开始打破了，但是在思想上解决问题，还需要一段较长的时间。党对知识分子的团结、教育、改造方针的贯彻，使我们改变了过去为科学而科学的错误想法，逐步认识到为人民服务这一条基本原则。从“三反”运动直到反右派斗争和“双反”运动，一系列群众性的政治思想斗争的重大胜利，使我们一步步离开了腐朽的资产阶级思想和种种伪科学的影响，转而面向无产阶级的观点和马克思列宁主义真理。“政治挂帅”、“又红又专”现在已经为大家所接受，成为我们努力自我改造的目标。
      “向苏联学习”这一口号，在实践中对我们思想的提高，起了很大的作用。九三学社社员中从事科学工作的同志，过去所熟悉的，多半是资本主义国家的科学情况，因而也把资产阶级科学家的道路当作唯一的道路。学习了苏联的先进科学，这才扩大了眼界，逐渐分辨了科学事业中的两条道路，认识到科学和社会主义的关系。自从苏联的人造卫星和宇宙火箭一再发射成功，我们一致欢呼以马克思列宁主义为指导思想而遵循社会主义道路进行的苏联科学的伟大胜利。苏联专家在我国工作时勤勤恳恳为人民事业奋不顾身的模范行为和他们的崇高的国际主义精神，使许多和他们共同工作的我社同志，受到了感动，努力地向他们学习。不少人接触到这些具有共产主义道德品质的科学家以后，以英美的浸透着资产阶级思想的科学家和他们对比，更加认清了自己所应走的道路，加强了向苏联学习的热情和彻底改造自己的信心。
    我们周围的青年群众，也对我们原有的思想，发生了深刻的影响。青年们对党和毛主席的指引教导的无限忠诚，对于社会主义建设事业的热情，对敌对人物和腐朽思想进行斗争的坚决意志，迅速改正自己的缺点和错误的勇气，对于新鲜事物的敏感和旺盛的求知欲，依靠群众的集体主义精神，敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，都在党的教育下不断提高。特别是在去年的大跃进中，他们热烈地响应了党的进行技术革命、文化革命的号召，更表现出要奋勇担当艰巨的建设事业和实现党和毛主席的伟大理想的雄心，并且在党的领导和各方面的帮助下，做出了优异的成绩。看到这样的青年队伍日益成长，我们怎能不为后继有人、后来居上而欣喜？感到这些青年对老一辈科学家的深切期待，我们又怎能不回想起自己在青年时代的心情而更加振奋？十年树木，桃李成荫，从党所培养的，和劳动人民血肉相连的新的青年一代，我们看出了祖国的光辉未来，更鼓足自己的为社会主义服务的干劲。
    党对我们知识分子一贯是无比地关怀，不仅对我们的生活和工作给以适当的安排和积极帮助，而且还给了我们无数体验新的社会生活和参加生产实践与革命斗争的机会，使我们的身心得到了最需要的营养。通过各种各样的参观访问，我们接触到了忘我地工作着的广大的劳动人民和英勇保卫祖国的最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军和人民解放军。我们看到了革命老根据地的英雄们，听到了无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹。我们在参加土地改革中，获得了阶级斗争教育；在参观农业合作社和人民公社时，提高了对社会主义的认识。大量的水利工程，大批的新建工厂，蓬勃发展的科学、文化和教育事业，都使我们这些知识分子受到深刻的教育。我们在国内有丰富的政治生活，得以认识当前的形势以及党和国家的方针政策；有时到国外，又亲眼看见了伟大的苏联以及其他兄弟国家的蒸蒸日上的成就，会晤了国际上为世界和平民主而努力的进步人士。这一切，都使我们在生活实践和社会实践中不断地改变思想，提高认识；而最激动我们的，则是去年的大跃进和人民公社运动。紧接着整风运动的结束，我们就亲身经历了这一旷古未有的奇迹。我们的思想上的消极因素减少了，积极的成分增加了。大家积极参加力所能及的体力劳动，为实现知识分子工农化而努力。很多人由此有了较以前更大的转变，坚决要求自己成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。十年的岗位工作和社会生活实践，促进了我们的思想变化。无数眼前实例和一次又一次的亲身体会，都说明：要更好地为社会主义建设服务，就必须继续彻底进行自我改造。我们由此更加强了进一步改造的决心和信心，都制订了个人的红专规划以督促自己的进步。
    十年来，我们在许许多多的伟大成就面前，不能不问一问：为什么能达到这个地步？为什么祖国人民能骤然解放出这样无穷无尽的潜力，创造出这么多惊天动地的奇迹？为什么我们的工业化速度能远远超过资本主义国家？毫无疑义，这是由于我们的社会主义制度的无比的优越性，是由于广大人民群众的无穷的智慧和力量，是由于伟大的中国共产党和我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，是由于我们国家的指导思想——战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的巨大威力，而毛主席创造性地把马克思列宁主义和我国革命实践相结合的伟大思想，则是一切胜利的源泉。我们今后一定要更加努力学习，真诚地积极地接受党的领导，政治挂帅，鼓足干劲，充分贡献力量为社会主义建设服务。
    在悠久的历史中，十年只是一个短暂的过程，而我们伟大的祖国，却在这短短的十年间创造了奇迹，不但过去封建社会几千年的进展不能和今天相比，就是一切资本主义国家的发展也远远不能相比。由于去年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进，我们把资本主义国家过去几十年才能达到的工业化的进度在一两年内就达到了。两年完成五年计划，十年左右赶上英国，这就是党领导下的六亿五千万人民的豪迈气概的表现。我们深深庆幸能生活在这个时代，能看到共产主义的太阳在地球上吐露光芒。我们一定要加倍努力来改造自己和参加改造世界的大业。在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，我们六亿五千万人民，一定能够不断地以跃进的高速度，把祖国建设成为有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的、繁荣富强的伟大社会主义国家。
