Offering Auspicious Highland Barley to Chairman Mao
By Our Correspondent

In early September, more than 300 farmers from the western district of Lhasa carried a bundle of long-eared, large-grained, golden highland barley ears, waving red flags, beating gongs and drums, and happily reported the good news to the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Their representatives said to the responsible comrades of the Party committee: "This year's bumper harvest was given to us by the Party, and we dedicate this bundle of bumper barley to the Party and Chairman Mao." From that day on, the golden Lhasa Plain ushered in the prelude to a great harvest.

In the spring, when the rebellion launched by the reactionary upper strata of Tibet against the motherland and the people had just been quelled, the planting season seemed slightly delayed. At that time, the first thought that arose in people's minds was to seize the opportunity and sow the first batch of seeds of peace and happiness. The Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly led the farmers in spring ploughing, announcing that this year the land of the rebellious lords would be subject to "whoever plants it, harvests it," and the land of the lords who did not participate in the rebellion would be subject to "two-eight rent reduction"; a large number of cadres were sent to various villages to distribute a large amount of interest-free seed grain and relief rations, and to lead the farmers to repair canals, transport fertilizer, and plant seeds. In this way, although the planting season was later than in previous years, the planting area increased compared to previous years, and many wastelands that were previously forbidden to be planted by the reactionary lords were also planted with crops this year. When the seedlings were growing, they encountered drought. However, with the development of the "three-anti and two-reduction" movement (anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvee labor, anti-slavery and rent and interest reduction) in the vast rural areas of Lhasa, the farmers' enthusiasm for production soared, and they put forward the slogan of "protecting seedlings for a bumper harvest," repairing canals and dams, negotiating rational water use, and carrying out irrigation. When the crops began to ripen, it was the rainy season on the plateau, and the Lhasa River flooded, submerging some crops. At this time, the farmers along the riverbanks, under the leadership of the local Party and government and with the assistance of the stationed troops, launched a battle of "fighting the water for grain," building dikes to prevent disasters and draining water to protect seedlings, so that the crops did not suffer losses, and finally achieved today's bumper harvest.

During these days of harvest, the emancipated serfs of the Lhasa Plain celebrated the "Wangguo Festival" to welcome the harvest. People celebrated their new life and the bumper harvest to their heart's content. We participated in the grand "Wangguo Festival" held jointly by more than a thousand farmers from seventeen manors in the western suburbs of Lhasa. That morning, people dressed in festive costumes, lit auspicious pine smoke in front of their doors and in the fields, raised the five-star red flag on the lawn, and put up colorful tents. When the sun rose, people gathered from various villages to the lawn. In the past, this was the time when the rebellious lords Lalu Tsewang Dorje, Ouxie Tudeng Sangzhu, etc., extorted rent and debts from the serfs, but this year it was the day for the farmers to celebrate their emancipation and welcome the harvest.

The "Wangguo Festival" began, and people, some riding horses and some walking, sang and shouted, passing through the field paths with drooping ears of wheat, offering highland barley wine to each other in each field, and wishing a bumper harvest and good luck. Finally, beside a field of highland barley, they offered auspicious highland barley ears and a white Hada scarf to the statue of Chairman Mao hanging on the archway, and said loudly: "Chairman Mao, thanks to you, we have harvested our own crops for the first time in our lives!"

At the end of the lawn, knights with red tassels on their heads and bows and arrows on their backs were about to hold horse racing and archery. At the sound of a bugle, they galloped one after another, performing various skills, and the feathered arrows swooshed into the target. These competitions, in the past, were merely performances for the entertainment of the lord masters, but now they have won enthusiastic applause from the vast number of farmers.

Joy filled the golden Lhasa River valley, and people excitedly harvested crops and transported their own grain into their own huts. On the day of the start of harvesting in the eastern suburbs of Lhasa, we came to the original manor of the rebel Xianka Jumei Dorje. Standing on the three-meter-high "earth fort" and looking out, the red flags of the production commando team fluttered in the wind in the fields, and more than forty commando team members, each tied with a red headscarf, competed with sickles. The chest-deep highland barley fell in front of the sickles, and soon turned into piles of wheat stacks scattered in the fields. A Tibetan cadre told us that this "earth fort" used to be the place where the lords supervised the serfs' labor and punished them, but now it has become a watchtower for the emancipated farmers to guard their crops.

In mid-September, we came to Qushui Township, Qushui County. When we arrived, it was already late at night. In the office of the township farmers' association, the director Zhongzhu, the deputy director Baima, and several committee members were studying their work. They were all born as domestic slaves and serfs. The farmers said that they had suffered all the hardships of the lords, and their demands for reform were the most resolute. They were also kind and fair, so they were elected to be in charge. They did not disappoint the hopes of their poor brothers, and in these days of bumper harvest, they led the masses in autumn harvest during the day and studied their work until late at night.

After bidding farewell to these village cadres who worked day and night for the masses, we were attracted by the joyful singing to the threshing ground. Here, the moonlight was bright, and more than a hundred people were singing Tibetan opera while beating cowhide drums. A young man who was an actor, an audience, and a farmer told us that there was a bumper harvest in every field here, and generally one gram of seed land could harvest ten grams of grain, and the highest reached twenty-four grams, which was a good harvest that had not been seen in recent years. People were very happy. After threshing for a while every night, they would sing Tibetan opera until late at night, and they still had inexhaustible energy to harvest crops the next day. At this time, two middle-aged women came to the dance floor. They had no time to brush off the dust from the threshing floor, and they joined the dance circle. After dancing for a while, they started talking to us. They were two sisters, one called Genzhu and the other called Cangjie. In the past, they planted fifteen grams of land for the rebellious lord, and every year when the grain was harvested, the lord would take it all away in the name of land rent and debts, leaving the whole family starving and borrowing new debts. This year, the policy of "whoever plants it, harvests it" was implemented, and the crops were harvested 30% more than in previous years. It is estimated that they can harvest more than 150 grams in total (equivalent to 4,000 jin), and the whole family of seven will no longer have to worry about food and clothing.

The golden Lhasa River valley is joyful and boiling!

    把吉祥的青稞献给毛主席
    本报记者
    9月初的一天，拉萨市西城区三百多位农民，抬着一束穗长粒大黄金般的青稞穗，打着红旗，敲着锣鼓，兴高采烈地向中共拉萨市委报喜。他们的代表向党委的负责同志说：“今年的丰收是党给我们的，把这束丰收的青稞献给党和毛主席。”从这天起，金色的拉萨平原揭开了大丰收的序幕。
    春天，当西藏上层反动集团发动的背叛祖国、背叛人民的叛乱刚一平息，播种时期已显得略迟了一些。当时，唤起人们的第一个念头，就是抓紧时机，撒下第一批和平幸福的种籽。中共拉萨市委及时地领导农民春耕，宣布了今年对叛乱领主的土地实行“谁种谁收”，未参加叛乱领主的土地实行“二八减租”；派出了大批干部深入各村庄，发放了大批无息种粮和救济口粮，并且领导农民修整水渠、运肥料和播种。这样，虽然播种时期较往年晚，播种面积却比往年有了增加，许多过去被反动领主禁种的荒地，今年也种上了庄稼。在青苗长起来的时候，遇到了旱象。但随着拉萨地区广大农村反叛乱、反乌拉、反奴役和进行减租减息的“三反双减”运动的开展，农民生产积极性空前高涨，提出了“保苗丰收”的口号，修整水渠、水坝，协商合理用水，进行灌溉。庄稼开始黄熟的时候，正是高原雨季，拉萨河洪水上涨，淹了一些庄稼。这时沿河两岸的农民，在当地党和政府的领导和驻军的协助下，展开了一场“与水争粮”的战斗，筑堤抢险，排水保苗，使庄稼没有遭受损失，终于得到了今天的丰收。
    在丰收的这些日子里，拉萨平原的翻身农奴们，分别地庆贺了迎丰收的“望果节”，人们尽情地欢庆自己得到新生、得到丰收。我们曾参加了拉萨西郊十七个溪卡一千多名农民联合举行的“望果节”盛会。那天清晨，人们穿着节日的盛装，在门前和田野燃起吉祥的松烟，在草坪上升起了五星红旗，撑起了彩色的帐篷。太阳升起来的时候，人们从各个村庄汇集到草坪上来。往年，这正是叛乱领主拉鲁·策旺多吉、欧协·土登桑却等向农奴索取租粮和债款的时候，今年却是农民们喜庆翻身和迎接丰收的日子。
    “望果节”开始了，人们有的骑马，有的步行，唱着、喊着，穿过麦穗低垂的田间小道，在每块田里互献青稞酒，祝贺丰收吉祥如意。最后在一块青稞地边，向牌坊上悬挂的毛主席像献了吉祥的青稞穗子和洁白的哈达，并高声说道：“毛主席，有了你，今年我们才有有生以来第一次收获自己的庄稼啊！”
    在草坪的尽头，头带红缨、身佩弓箭的骑士，就要举行跑马射箭了。一声号角响，一个接一个地急驰而来，表演着各式各样的技艺，羽箭嗖嗖地射在靶牌上。这些比赛，在过去仅仅是表演给领主老爷们娱乐的，现在却赢得了广大农民热烈的喝采。
    喜悦充满了金色的拉萨河谷，人们兴奋地收割庄稼，并把属于自己的粮食运进了自己的小屋。在拉萨东郊区开镰收获的那天，我们来到了叛乱分子先喀·居美多杰原来的溪卡。站在三米高的“土堡”上一看，田野里生产突击队的红旗迎风飘扬，四十多个突击队员，个个扎上红头巾挥镰竞赛，齐胸深的青稞迎着镰刀倒下，旋即又星罗棋布地在田里变成堆堆麦垛。一个藏族干部告诉我们，就是这个“土堡”，过去是领主们监督农奴劳动和惩罚农奴的场所，现在却成了翻身农民们看守庄稼的了望台。
    我们在9月中旬，来到曲水县曲水乡，到达时已经是深夜了，在乡农民协会的办公室里，主任中柱、副主任白玛和几个委员，正在研究工作。他们都是家奴和农奴出身，农民们说他们吃尽了领主的苦头，要求改革最坚决，为人又和蔼公正，所以选他们出来当家。他们没有辜负穷苦兄弟们的希望，在这丰收的日子里，白天领导群众秋收，晚上研究工作直到深夜。
    告辞了这些日夜为群众操劳的村干部们，我们被欢乐的歌声吸引到打麦场上。这里月光明亮，一百多人正在敲着牛皮鼓唱藏戏。一个又是演员、又是观众、又是农民的青年告诉我们，这里块块地丰收，一般一克种籽地收十克粮，最高达到二十四克，是近些年来没有过的好收成。人们非常高兴，每天晚上打过一阵场之后，就唱起藏戏来，一直要闹到深夜，第二天仍有用不完的力气去收获庄稼。这时，舞场上又来了两个中年妇女，她们来不及拂去打场时留下的满身灰尘，就投入了舞圈。舞了一阵之后，便同我们攀谈起来。她们是姐妹俩，一个叫根珠，一个叫仓杰，过去种了叛乱领主的十五克地，每年粮食一打下来，就被领主以地租、债务的名义七扣八折地抢得精光，全家饿着肚子再借新债。今年实行了“谁种谁收”，庄稼又比往年多收三成，估计全部能收一百五十多克（约合四千斤），全家七口人吃用再不发愁了。
    金色的拉萨河谷在欢乐，在沸腾！
