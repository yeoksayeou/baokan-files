The returning overseas Chinese sports visiting group attended today's opening ceremony.

Ambassadors and diplomatic officials of various countries to China were invited to attend the opening ceremony. More than 80,000 people attended the opening ceremony. Today, the weather in Beijing was clear, and colorful flags were planted around the Workers' Stadium. Above the rostrum hung huge portraits of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Lin Biao, and Deng Xiaoping, as well as large slogans such as "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" and "Develop sports and strengthen the people's physique." The opening ceremony was presided over by Huang Zhong, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the First National Games. Huang Zhong announced the opening of the ceremony, and the military band composed of more than 1,200 people played military music in unison. Amidst thunderous applause, led by the honor guard carrying the national emblem and red flags, athletes of all nationalities participating in the National Games, full of vigor, marched into the stadium to accept the review of Party and state leaders. Outstanding national male and female athletes and national referees walked at the forefront of each delegation. Most of these outstanding athletes are the elite of the master athletes. There are creators of world records in swimming, track and field, and aviation models; the highest female mountaineers in the world; creators of national records; members of the national men's and women's basketball, football, volleyball, and table tennis teams; and world table tennis singles champions. They have established meritorious service for the country's sports movement and won glory for the country. The outstanding national male team members wore navy blue formal attire with the national emblem, while the outstanding national female team members wore colorful fashions. The audience responded with warm applause as each stand was passed.

Following the leaders who accepted the review were the teams from the People's Liberation Army, Shanghai, Shanxi, Sichuan, Gansu, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Guangxi, Liaoning, Tibet, Yunnan, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan, Jilin, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Qinghai, Hubei, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Fujian, Xinjiang, Beijing and other twenty-nine national delegations. Behind each delegation's flag were three leaders and the athletes. The athletes of each delegation wore sports uniforms of different colors, exposing their dark, strong, and powerful legs and arms. The female athletes all wore short skirts and shirts with ribbons tied in their hair. There are advanced labor figures from all walks of life, model workers, combat heroes, and "three-good" students in the team. They were all welcomed by warm applause from the audience.

The People's Liberation Army delegation, the guardians of the peaceful construction of the motherland, and the delegations from remote ethnic minority areas such as Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Tibet, Yunnan, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, who traveled thousands of miles, received thunderous applause from the audience as they passed each stand. Among the leaders of the delegations from ethnic minority areas, there were Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Uighur, and other ethnic groups with distinctive costumes, symbolizing the gathering of athletes from all ethnic groups in our country. The Tibetan delegation received a particularly warm welcome. This sports team was established only a few months ago, and some of them were slaves under the unliberated serf system not long ago. However, due to hard training, their competitive results have improved rapidly in a short period of time, and many people have reached the level of national-level athletes.

After the band played the national anthem, He Long, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, delivered the opening speech (full text on page 4). On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, He Long warmly congratulated the victorious opening of the First National Games of the People's Republic of China and expressed a warm welcome to the guests present.

Vice Premier He Long briefly talked about the unprecedented great victories of the socialist revolution and socialist construction achieved by the people of all ethnic groups in our country in these glorious ten years. He said: "Our sports cause, due to the firm implementation of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's policy of carrying out mass sports activities to serve production and national defense, has also achieved great achievements in the past ten years. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and encouraged and promoted by the Great Leap Forward, the People's Communes, and the movement of All the People Soldiers, both the popularization of mass sports and the improvement of sports technical level have achieved leapfrog development and remarkable achievements."

Vice Premier He Long elaborated on the great achievements of China's sports movement in the past decade and the reasons for achieving these great achievements, and clearly pointed out that "in future work, we must resolutely implement the policy of sports serving production and national defense. Strengthen the Party's leadership, put politics in command, oppose right-leaning thoughts, hold high the brilliant banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and continue to implement the principle of combining popularization and improvement. Learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. Popularize mass sports, enhance the people's physique, accelerate the improvement of sports technical level, and constantly create new records, especially improve the results of major sports projects. Push China's sports movement to a new stage of more universal and in-depth development."

Vice Premier He Long called on all comrades of the National Games to follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee, put politics in command, go all out, aim high, carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to do, and good moral style. Work together with one heart and one mind, unite as one, be conscientious and responsible, and learn with humility. Do not be arrogant in victory, nor be discouraged in defeat, and with the heroic spirit of the Chinese people in the era of the Great Leap Forward, do everything possible to create outstanding achievements, and make the National Games a success and a splendid one!

Vice Premier He Long finished his speech. More than 100 female athletes from twenty-nine sports delegations each held a bouquet of flowers and ran lightly to the rostrum to present flowers to the national leaders to pay tribute. Suddenly, colorful balloons rose into the air, and a thousand peace doves flapped their wings and flew into the sky from the stands. Cheers and applause from the stage and the audience resounded in one voice.

When the athletes retreated, more than 600 children immediately ran to the front of the rostrum, to the front of the foreign guests' stands, and to the front of the surrounding audience stands to present flowers and pay tribute. The group callisthenics performance, entitled "National Celebration," officially began. Participating in the group callisthenics performance were 8,000 male and female students from some primary schools, middle schools, and universities in Beijing. They successively performed exercises for happy children, flowers of youth exercises, heroes competing in martial arts, double skills, Long Live Motherland, and other exercises. These callisthenics movements are beautiful and varied, reflecting the happy growth of children in the new China, the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and demonstrating the martial arts style with historical traditions in our country. They constantly won cheers from the audience.

Finally, a match in the second stage final of the National Games football competition was held between the Beijing team and the Guangdong team. The Beijing team won four to one. (Picture attached)
