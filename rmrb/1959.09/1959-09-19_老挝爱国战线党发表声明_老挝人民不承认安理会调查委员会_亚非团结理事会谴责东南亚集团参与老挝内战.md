Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th - According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesman for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, Khamtay Siphandone, issued a statement on September 14 regarding the United Nations Security Council's dispatch of a so-called "Investigative Subcommittee" to Laos, stating that the aforementioned decision of the United Nations Security Council is illegal, violates international agreements, and violates the wishes of the Lao people. It cannot bring peace but only creates conditions for expanding the civil war in Laos and provoking war in Indochina.

Khamtay pointed out that at this very moment, U.S. imperialism is increasing military aid to the Sananikone government to further expand the Lao civil war; countries subservient to the U.S. in the Southeast Asia Treaty Military Group and reactionaries in South Vietnam are clamoring for direct military intervention in Laos.

He emphasized that the Lao Patriotic Front Party and all the Lao people firmly oppose and do not recognize the Security Council's so-called "Investigative Subcommittee," and that any work it undertakes is invalid for the Lao people.

Khamtay pointed out that the Lao Patriotic Front Party and the Lao people only recognize the Geneva Agreements and Vientiane Agreements regarding Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 17th - The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council today issued a statement to the press condemning the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's involvement in interfering in Lao internal affairs and provoking civil war in Laos to create tension in the region.

The Secretariat also criticized the United Nations for dispatching a subcommittee to Laos to investigate the situation, disregarding the 1954 Geneva Accords, thereby interfering in Laos.

The statement pointed out that the facts of the five years since the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization clearly show that its purpose is to strengthen the economic and political position of colonial countries and to undermine and destroy the national liberation movements of the peoples of the East. The statement said that colonial countries are attempting to use this organization as a new Trojan horse to infiltrate the most important areas of Asia; and the group's only three Asian member states obediently carry out the strategic objectives of their main partner and true master—the United States.

Speaking of the U.S. plan to establish a Northeast Asia Treaty Organization, the statement pointed out that this is an attempt to expand the scope of activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which means intensifying artificial tensions and strengthening colonialism.

The statement said that earlier this year it was learned that a special agency had been established to coordinate the activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the ANZUS Treaty Organization, the then Baghdad Pact Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The statement pointed out that the purpose of this is to ultimately turn the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization into an auxiliary body of NATO, a stronghold of U.S. militarism. The first result of this is the establishment of atomic bases and missile installations in Southeast Asian regions such as South Vietnam.

The statement said that therefore, the Asian-African solidarity movement cannot but express deep surprise at the dangerous policies of the heads of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and lodge a strong protest.

The statement concluded that the peoples of Asia and Africa are well aware that any attempts by the heads of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization must be defeated, and that peace in the region can only be guaranteed through the establishment of peace zones and nuclear-weapon-free zones.

    老挝爱国战线党发表声明
    老挝人民不承认安理会调查委员会
    亚非团结理事会谴责东南亚集团参与老挝内战
    新华社河内18日电　据越南通讯社报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人堪代9月14日就联合国安全理事会派出所谓“调查小组委员会”到老挝的问题发表声明说，联合国安理会的上述决定是非法的，它违反了国际协议并且违反了老挝人民的愿望。它不能带来和平，只能为扩大老挝的内战和挑起印度支那的战争创造条件。
    堪代指出，就在这个时候，美帝国主义增加对萨纳尼空政府的军事援助以进一步扩大老挝内战；在东南亚条约军事集团中的美国仆从国家和越南南方的反动派等，大肆叫嚣要对老挝进行直接的军事干涉。
    他强调指出，老挝爱国战线党和老挝全体人民坚决反对和不承认安理会的所谓“调查小组委员会”，它所进行的工作对于老挝人民来说都是无效的。
    堪代指出，老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民只承认关于老挝的日内瓦协议和万象协议。
    新华社开罗17日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天向报界发表一项声明，谴责东南亚条约组织参与干涉老挝内政和挑起老挝内战，以便在这个地区制造紧张局势。
    书记处同时指责联合国不顾1954年的日内瓦协议而派遣所谓调查老挝局势的小组委员会到老挝，从而对老挝进行了干涉。
    声明指出，东南亚条约组织成立五年间的事实清楚地表明，东南亚条约组织的目的是加强殖民国家的经济和政治地位，并且破坏和摧毁东方各国人民的民族解放运动。声明说，殖民国家企图把这个组织作为新的特洛伊木马，以便渗入亚洲最重要的地区；而这个集团仅有的三个亚洲成员国唯命是从地执行着它们的主要伙伴和真正主人——美国——的战略目的。
    在谈到美国策划建立东北亚条约组织的计划时，声明指出，这是一种扩大东南亚条约组织活动范围的企图，这意味着加剧人为的紧张局势和加强殖民主义。
    声明说，今年早些时候获悉，已经建立一个特别的机构来协调北大西洋公约组织、美澳新条约组织、当时的巴格达条约组织和东南亚条约组织的活动。声明指出，这样做的目的是为了把东南亚条约组织最后变成美国军国主义的堡垒北大西洋公约组织的一个附属机构，这样做的第一个结果是在像南越这样的东南亚地区设立原子基地和导弹设置。
    声明说，因此，亚非团结运动不能不对东南亚条约组织首脑的这种危险的政策深表惊讶，并且提出强硬的抗议。
    声明最后说，亚非各国人民十分清楚，必须击败东南亚条约组织首脑的任何企图，这个地区的和平只能通过建立和平区和无核武器区才能得到保障。
