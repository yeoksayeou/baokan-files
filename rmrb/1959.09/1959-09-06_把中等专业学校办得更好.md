To Run Secondary Specialized Schools Better
By a commentator of this newspaper

    The task of secondary specialized schools is to cultivate middle-level specialized personnel with socialist consciousness and a certain cultural level. Since liberation, secondary specialized schools have greatly developed. Especially driven by the situation of the Great Leap Forward last year, secondary specialized schools have been established from the province to the prefecture level. Many previously blank specialties have been gradually set up, and new specialties have been added with the development of science and technology. In the past few years, secondary specialized schools have already sent more than 1.3 million graduates to grassroots production and work posts. In some industrial sectors, more than 80% of the secondary technical personnel are graduates of secondary specialized schools. At the same time, some graduates of secondary specialized schools, after several years of practical training, have been promoted to the level of engineers and have taken on the work of engineers. This year, another large number of secondary specialized school graduates are leaving school to go to places where the motherland needs them.
    Secondary specialized school students have similarities with ordinary middle school students in that they are younger, lack social knowledge, and have weaker independent working abilities; at the same time, they also have similarities with university students in that they study a major and are required to be able to work independently after leaving school. However, the training goals of secondary specialized schools are different from both ordinary middle schools and universities. Students in secondary specialized schools must have the corresponding basic knowledge and specialized knowledge, master certain operational skills or working methods, and possess certain organizational management skills. The teaching work of secondary specialized schools needs to take into account both the students' basic knowledge and their specialized knowledge and practical skills; it must not only specifically guide students' learning, life, and work, but also pay attention to cultivating their independent working abilities.
    Currently, in order to directly combine professional teaching with production labor, many secondary specialized schools have universally established production labor sites in their teaching. Through production labor, the teachers and students have established the idea of ​​loving labor, increased their practical knowledge of production, improved students' independent working abilities, and also created certain wealth for the country. The factories run by schools must be combined with teaching as much as possible, and the scale of the factory should be adapted to the teaching needs and the labor force of the students. In order to further promote production labor, schools must summarize the experience of combining education with production labor, seek appropriate forms of labor, enrich appropriate production content, and consider how to adapt to new changes and improve the teaching methods of professional courses after students participate in production labor and increase their practical knowledge. All types of schools (industry, agriculture, medicine, teachers, art, etc.) must actively make proper arrangements according to their own teaching requirements and incorporate production labor into the teaching plan. Schools can also combine teaching and production labor to appropriately organize students to participate in general scientific and technological activities outside of class.
    Building a strong contingent of teachers who are both red and expert is the key to developing and improving secondary specialized education. At present, it is necessary to improve the teachers' political consciousness through political study, production labor, and teaching practice, and also to adopt various methods to improve their theoretical knowledge and practical production knowledge, in order to meet the teaching requirements. Although there is an urgent need to improve the quality of teachers, the quantity is also insufficient. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has taken many measures to train teachers: restoring and strengthening teacher in-service training colleges; opening teacher training courses and short-term training classes; and transferring in-service teachers to universities for further study. The Guangdong Provincial Education Department entrusted well-established secondary specialized schools to open training classes for basic course teachers; selected some people from the current graduates to stay in school to work or sent them to universities for further study; and uniformly adjusted and allocated teachers for similar schools by the province. These practices are relatively good. In addition to the central government and provinces and cities finding ways to solve the teacher problem, schools must pay attention to cultivating and improving teachers.
    At present, schools generally attach importance to the work of compiling teaching materials, but the work is still uneven. Some schools have not yet compiled teaching materials because the education plan and teaching syllabus have not been revised and the teachers have a heavy teaching load. In order to strive to compile good teaching materials in a not-too-long period of time, we should adopt a combination of unified leadership and division of responsibility, a combination of centralized compilation and separate compilation, and a combination of specialized compilation and teaching while compiling, mobilize forces, and complete the task of compiling all teaching materials. The central business departments have compiled many teaching materials in the past and can summarize their experiences to promote the work. The scope of basic technical course materials is relatively large. If each compiles their own, it will waste effort. For example, theoretical mechanics is required for many majors. Therefore, it is necessary for departments to help and cooperate with each other.
    Strengthening the leadership of secondary specialized schools is an urgent task at present. Last year, many secondary specialized schools were run by local authorities; at the same time, various central ministries also decentralized some secondary specialized schools; the scale of the original schools has also been expanded, making the teaching work more complicated and the management more difficult. Therefore, the leadership of secondary specialized schools must be strengthened. Each province, city, and prefecture should have a dedicated institution to manage secondary specialized schools, and the relevant local business bureaus should strengthen supervision and leadership over the schools. In addition to strengthening the leadership of the secondary specialized schools under their jurisdiction, the central ministries should also provide assistance and guidance to the relevant secondary specialized schools run by local authorities.
    Under the leadership of the Party, strengthening political and ideological education work and continuing to implement the Party's education policy, the cause of secondary specialized education will present a brand new look.

    把中等专业学校办得更好
    本报评论员
    中等专业学校的任务，是培养具有社会主义觉悟的有一定文化水平的中等专门人材。解放以来，中等专业学校有了很大发展。特别是在去年生产大跃进的形势推动下，从省到专区都办了中等专业学校。过去许多空白的专业，都逐步设置起来，随着科学技术的发展，又增加了新的专业。过去几年来，中等专业学校已经输送了一百三十多万毕业生到基层的生产和工作岗位上去。有的工业部门中等技术人员中，有80％以上是由中等专业学校毕业生来担任的。同时，有些中等专业学校的毕业生，经过几年的实际锻炼，已经提高到工程师的水平，并且担任了工程师的工作。今年又有大批中等专业学校毕业生走出校门，到祖国需要的地方去。
    中等专业学校的学生同普通中学的学生有相同之点，都是年龄较轻，社会知识不够，独立工作能力较差；同时，又同高等学校的学生有相同之点，学习专业，要求走出校门能够独立工作。但是中等专业学校的培养目标既不同于普通中学，又不同于高等学校。中等专业学校的学生，必须具有相应的基础知识和专业知识，掌握一定的操作技能或工作方法，并且具备一定的组织管理能力。中等专业学校的教学工作，就需要既照顾到学生的基础知识，也照顾到学生的专业知识和实际技能；既要具体辅导学生的学习、生活和工作，又要注意培养他们的独立工作能力。
    现在，许多中等专业学校在教学中，为了能够把专业教学同生产劳动直接结合起来，普遍建立了生产劳动场所。通过生产劳动，树立了师生热爱劳动的思想，增加了师生的生产实际知识，提高了学生的独立工作能力，也为国家创造了一定的财富。学校办的工厂一定要尽可能地结合教学，工厂的规模应该与教学需要和学生的劳动力相适应。为了把生产劳动推进一步，学校要总结教育结合生产劳动的经验，寻求适当的劳动方式，充实适当的生产内容，并考虑到学生参加生产劳动，增加实际知识以后，如何适应新的变化，改进专业课的教学方法。各类学校（工、农、医、师、艺术，等等）都要根据自己的教学要求，积极地进行妥善安排，把生产劳动纳入教学计划中去。学校还可以结合教学和生产劳动，适当地组织学生在课外参加一般的科学技术活动。
    建立一支强大的又红又专的教师队伍，是发展和提高中等专业教育的关键。目前要通过政治学习、生产劳动和教学实践来提高教师的政治觉悟，又要采取各种办法来提高他们的理论知识和生产实际知识，才能满足教学要求。现在教师固然迫切需要在质量上提高，但是数量也很不足。冶金工业部在培养师资方面，采取了许多办法：恢复和加强教师进修学院；开办了师资专修科和短期训练班；抽调在职教师到高等学校进修。广东省教育部门委托基础好的中等专业学校开设基础课教师培训班；在应届毕业生中挑选一些人留校工作或送高等学校进修；对于同类学校，由省统一调整调配师资。这些做法都是比较好的。除了中央和省、市设法解决师资问题以外，学校必须注意培养和提高师资。
    目前，各学校一般都重视教材的编写工作，但是工作还不平衡。也有的学校由于教育计划、教学大纲还未修订，教师任课较重，还没有编写教材。要争取在不太长的时期内编好教材，应当采取统一领导与分工负责相结合，集中编写与分头编写相结合，专门编写和边教学边编写相结合的方法，动员力量，完成全部教材的编写任务。中央业务部门过去已经编写了许多教材，可以总结经验借以推动工作。基础技术课教材需要的范围比较大，如果各编各的，就会浪费力量。例如理论力学，许多专业都要学。所以部门和部门之间，有必要互助协作。
    加强对中等专业学校的领导，是当前一项迫切的任务。去年地方办的中等专业学校很多；同时，中央各部又下放了一部分中等专业学校；原有学校的规模也都有所扩大，教学工作比较复杂，管理比较困难。所以，对中等专业学校的领导必须加强。各省、市、专区，应该设有专门机构，把中等专业学校管起来，地方有关业务厅局，要对学校加强监督和领导。中央各部除了对所属中等专业学校加强领导外，对地方办的有关的中等专业学校，也要予以帮助和指导。
    在党的领导下，加强政治思想教育工作，继续贯彻党的教育方针，中等专业教育事业将会出现簇新的面貌。
