Our modern humans, where do we ultimately come from? Ever since humans possessed "thinking," they have posed such questions, but in times before the development of science, answers remained elusive for a long time. Western religious figures said: "God created man." In ancient China, we also have the myth of Nüwa creating humans by kneading yellow earth. These superstitious myths were later used by the ruling class as tools to govern the people.

It was not until the second half of the nineteenth century, with the tremendous development of biological science, that the British biologist Darwin proposed the theory that humans evolved from ancient apes. However, constrained by bourgeois ideology, he failed to explain the causes of human evolution. Only our revolutionary and great teacher Engels brilliantly explained the reasons for the evolution of ancient apes into humans. This is his immortal theory of "Labor Created Man."

We Chinese people are very fortunate that in Zhoukoudian, near our capital Beijing, the earliest ancestors of mankind, or humans contemporaneous with the earliest ancestors—the Chinese Ape-Man (commonly known as Peking Man)—were discovered. Furthermore, evidence of tools used and fire employed by our ancestors was found, powerfully proving the theory that labor creates man.

The discovery and research of the Chinese Ape-Man made it impossible for bourgeois scholars who scorn labor to refute Engels' theory.

Now, the Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio, with the support of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the strong cooperation of the Shanghai Animation Film Studio, has filmed the research work on "Chinese Ape-Man" and other related research on human fossils in China into a science education film, which will be shown in major cities across the country during the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation. This demonstrates the Party's emphasis on scientific endeavors and signifies the great leap forward in scientific undertakings. The people of the whole country should cheer for it!

From this film, we can understand how our ancestors from 500,000 years ago made and used tools, and how they engaged in arduous struggles with nature and achieved victory. This not only enriches our historical knowledge and increases our belief in historical materialism but also strengthens the will of us people who are currently building socialism to struggle against nature.

    庆祝“中国猿人”电影的上演
    裴文中
    我们现代的人类，究竟从哪里来？人类从有了“思维”以来，就提出了这样的问题，但是在科学未发达的时期，长期没有得到解答。西洋宗教家说：“上帝造人”。我们中国古代也流传着女娲氏用黄土捏人的神话。这些迷信的神话，后来被统治阶级所利用，作为统治人民的工具。
    直到十九世纪后半世，生物科学有了巨大的发展，英国生物学家达尔文才提出人类是由古代的猿猴进化而来的说法。但是因为他受了资产阶级思想的束缚，没有能够解释人类进化的原因。只有我们革命的伟大导师恩格斯才天才地解释了古猿进化成人的原因。这就是他不朽的“劳动创造了人”的学说。
    我们中国人民很幸运，就在我们首都北京的附近周口店，发现了人类最早的祖先或者是同最早的祖先同时的人类——中国猿人（俗名北京人）。并且发现了我们祖先使用的工具和用火的证据；更有力地证明劳动创造人的理论。
    中国猿人的发现和研究，使轻视劳动的资产阶级学者没有理由再来反驳恩格斯的理论。
    现在上海科学教育电影制片厂，在中国科学院古脊椎动物研究所的支持之下，与上海美术电影制片厂的大力协作下，将“中国猿人”的研究工作以及中国其他有关人类化石的研究工作拍摄成了一部科学教育影片，在建国十周年时在全国各大都市演出。这说明党对科学事业的重视，也说明了科学事业的大跃进。全国人民应当为它欢呼！
    从这部影片中，我们可以了解我们五十万年以前的远祖，如何制造和使用工具，如何同自然界进行艰苦的斗争而取得胜利。这不但丰富我们的历史知识和增加对历史唯物主义的信念，还可使我们正在建设社会主义的人们增强对自然斗争的意志。
