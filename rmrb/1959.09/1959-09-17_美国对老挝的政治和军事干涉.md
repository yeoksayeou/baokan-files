U.S. Political and Military Interference in Laos

    After Laos restored domestic peace under the Geneva Accords in 1954, the United States has been carrying out extremely vicious political and military interference in Laos. The breakdown of the national unity that Laos had once achieved after the restoration of peace and the re-emergence of civil war in Laos were all caused by the United States' interference. The current intensified support by the United States for the Phoui Sananikone government's actions to expand the civil war and the conspiracy to launch armed intervention in Laos through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are making the tense situation in Laos and Southeast Asia even more dangerous.

　　In order to achieve its goal of enslaving the Lao people and turning Laos into its military base, the United States has been pursuing a policy of undermining the reconciliation between the two sides in Laos and re-igniting the civil war in Laos, attempting to use the means of "using Laotians to rule Laotians" to strangle the patriotic forces of Laos and place the Lao ruling group under its military and political control.
　
　  According to this policy, the United States has taken a series of despicable and blatant acts of interference in Laos. In September 1954, shortly after the start of negotiations between the Kingdom of Laos government and the former Lao Issara forces on the peaceful reunification of the country, the United States instigated pro-American elements in Laos to assassinate Defense Minister Kou Voravong, who advocated negotiations with the former Lao Issara forces, causing the negotiations to be interrupted and triggering a crisis in the Phouma cabinet. Subsequently, then U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles personally traveled to Laos on February 27, 1955, to instruct the newly appointed Lao Prime Minister, the pro-American Katay Don Sasorith, to "launch more vigorous actions to deal with the Lao Issara." Under the direct instigation of the United States, the Katay government launched large-scale offensives against the former Lao Issara forces in June and July 1955.

    In order to obstruct reconciliation between the two sides in Laos, the United States also created division activities in Laos and constantly exerted economic pressure on successive Phouma cabinets that advocated national reconciliation. After the re-established Phouma cabinet resumed negotiations with the former Lao Issara forces in August 1956, the United States incited a group of Lao reactionary officers to launch offensives against the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, and also directed the remnant armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to launch offensives against the Lao Royal Army and instigated pro-American and pro-Thai elements in Lower Laos to engage in separatist activities, in order to put pressure on the Phouma cabinet. At the same time, the United States threatened to suspend "aid," delaying the allocation of "aid" funds several times, making it impossible for the Phouma cabinet to pay salaries in a timely manner. As a result, although the Phouma cabinet reached a principled agreement with the former Lao Issara forces on the establishment of a coalition government on December 28, 1956, it had to resign again in May 1957 due to various pressures from the United States.

　　The U.S. magazine "The Nation" admitted that after the two sides in Laos reached the above-mentioned principled agreement, the United States had exerted various pressures on the Phouma cabinet, implying that it should cancel the above-mentioned agreement.
　
　In this regard, the notes submitted by the United States, Britain, and France to the Kingdom of Laos government on April 16, 1957, were an extremely blatant threat. In this note, the United States, Britain, and France accused the former Lao Issara forces of raising "irrelevant conditions" in the negotiations and demanded that the Kingdom of Laos government adopt a "tough attitude." The so-called "irrelevant conditions" accused here by the United States, Britain, and France included the demands put forward by the former Lao Issara forces to implement a policy of peace and neutrality and establish a coalition government. It can be seen that what the imperialist group headed by the United States hates is precisely the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding Laos becoming a peaceful and neutral country and the national unity of Laos.

    However, under the strong desire of the Lao people for peaceful reunification and neutrality, the Phouma cabinet, which re-established itself in August 1957, finally reached an agreement with the former Lao Issara forces on November 2 of the same year on the establishment of a coalition government and the resolution of the issue of the two provinces. After this, the United States again exerted pressure on the Phouma cabinet by threatening to devalue the kip (Lao currency) against the U.S. dollar, stop allocating U.S. "aid," and freeze Lao deposits in U.S. banks. At the same time, a group of extremely pro-American young Lao officers, young diplomats stationed abroad, and senior members of the Lao Youth Chamber of Commerce organized by the United States formed the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" in June 1958. Due to financial difficulties and pressure from pro-American right-wing forces, the Phouma cabinet finally resigned in July 1958.

    In 1958, Phoui Sananikone came to power and reorganized the cabinet in January 1959. According to the will of the United States, the new Phoui Sananikone cabinet included seven members of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" among its fourteen cabinet members. After this thoroughly pro-American and traitorous government was formed, the United States immediately instructed it in February of this year to unilaterally declare the abandonment of the Geneva Accords, and then instructed it in May to re-ignite the civil war in Laos.

    The U.S. magazine "Newsweek" in its June 1 issue described the fact that the United States finally orchestrated the re-ignition of the civil war by the Phoui Sananikone government, which it had single-handedly put into power, as an "almost miraculous achievement." This complacent revelation by this American magazine is precisely an admission of U.S. interference in Laos.

    While engaging in political interference, the United States has continuously violated the Geneva Accords, transporting large quantities of military equipment and military personnel into Laos to be used by the reactionary pro-American regime of Laos to launch a civil war, and turning Laos into a U.S. military base in order to undermine peace in Indochina and threaten China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. According to a recent disclosure by a reporter for the U.S. "Wall Street Journal," "In the past five years, U.S. military and economic aid to Laos has amounted to approximately $225 million." It should be pointed out that the vast majority of U.S. "aid" to Laos is "military aid," and most of the "economic aid" is also used for military purposes. For example, the expenses of the Lao police and the costs of the United States constructing strategic highways and airports in Laos are all allocated under the U.S. "economic aid" item.

    The United States has also dispatched a large number of military personnel to Laos under the guise of "technical personnel" and "employees" to control the Lao army and military bases. According to U.S. diplomatic officials in Vientiane on August 8, approximately one hundred U.S. military personnel have arrived in Vientiane since July 25 of this year.

    In the process of conducting military interference in Laos, the United States has tried its best to utilize the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. This aggressive bloc has repeatedly claimed that Laos is within its "protected area." The Phoui Sananikone government's armed offensive against the former Lao Issara forces was launched after this aggressive bloc formulated a "blueprint" for intervention in Laos at the Wellington Conference in April of this year. Currently, the United States is stepping up its planning to have the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization come forward to launch armed intervention in Laos. The United States' manipulation of the United Nations Security Council to illegally dispatch a "investigation sub-committee" to Laos is to create a "basis" for the United States' plan to carry out international intervention in Laos.

    In order to further expand the civil war in Laos, the U.S. government openly decided on August 26 to provide the Phoui Sananikone government with a large amount of weapons and U.S. dollars in "emergency aid." According to this "aid" plan, the United States has been continuously transporting large quantities of military equipment into Laos since August 31. A spokesman for U.S. Pacific Armed Forces Commander Felt revealed that some of this military equipment was transported from Japan to Laos. The United States chartered aircraft from the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan to transport this batch of military equipment.

### 美国对老挝的政治和军事干涉

    美国对老挝的政治和军事干涉
    1954年老挝根据日内瓦协议恢复国内和平以后，美国一直对老挝进行着穷凶极恶的政治和军事干涉。老挝在恢复和平后一度达成的国内团结所以遭到破坏和老挝内战的重新爆发，都是美国的干涉行动造成的。美国目前加紧支持培·萨纳尼空政府扩大内战的行动和正在策划的通过东南亚条约组织武装干涉老挝的阴谋，使老挝和东南亚地区的紧张局势具有了更加危险的性质。
　　美国为了达到奴役老挝人民和把老挝变为它的军事基地的目的，一直执行着破坏老挝双方和解和重新挑起老挝内战的政策，企图通过“以寮治寮”的手段，绞杀老挝的爱国力量，并且把老挝统治集团置于它的军事和政治控制之下。　
　  根据这种政策，美国对老挝采取了一系列的卑鄙和露骨的干涉行动。1954年9月，老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队关于和平统一国家的谈判开始不久，美国就指使老挝的亲美分子刺杀了主张同前寮国战斗部队谈判的国防部长古·沃拉冯，使谈判陷于中断，并且引起富马内阁的危机。接着，美国前国务卿杜勒斯在1955年2月27日亲自赶到老挝，当面指示新上台的老挝首相、亲美分子卡代·敦·萨索里特“发动更加强有力的行动来对付寮国”。在美国的直接策动下，卡代政府在1955年6、7月间对前寮国战斗部队发动了大规模的进攻。
    为了阻挠老挝双方和解，美国还在老挝制造分裂活动，并且不断对历届主张民族和解的富马内阁施加经济压力。在重新执政的富马内阁同前寮国战斗部队于1956年8月恢复谈判以后，美国就煽动一批老挝反动军官向桑怒和丰沙里两省发动进攻，并且指使蒋介石集团残余武装向老挝王国军队发动进攻和策动下寮亲美亲泰分子搞分裂活动，借以对富马内阁施加压力。同时，美国以中止“援助”相威胁，几次拖延拨付“援助”款项，使富马内阁不能及时发放薪饷。这样，富马内阁虽然在1956年12月28日同前寮国战斗部队就成立联合政府问题达成原则协议，但是由于美国的种种压力，不得不在1957年5月再度辞职。
　　美国“民族”周刊承认，在老挝双方达成上述原则协议以后，美国曾经对富马内阁施加种种压力，暗示它应该取消上述协议。　
　在这方面，美国在1957年4月16日伙同英、法两国分别提交给老挝王国政府的照会是一次极其露骨的威胁。美、英、法三国在这项照会中指责前寮国战斗部队在谈判中提出“不相干的条件”，并且要求老挝王国政府采取“强硬态度”。美、英、法在这里指责的所谓“不相干的条件”，包括了前寮国战斗部队提出的执行和平中立政策和成立联合政府等要求。可以看出，以美国为首的帝国主义集团所仇视的正是日内瓦协议关于老挝应该成为和平中立国家的规定和老挝的民族团结。
    但是，在老挝人民强烈要求和平统一和中立的愿望下，于1957年8月重新执政的富马内阁终于在同年11月2日同前寮国战斗部队达成关于成立联合政府和解决两省问题的协议。而在这以后，美国又通过威胁要贬低基普（老挝币）同美元的比值、停止拨付美“援”和冻结老挝在美国银行中的存款等手段，对富马内阁施加压力。与此同时，老挝的一批极端亲美的青年军官、青年驻外使节和美国组织的老挝青年商会的上层分子在1958年6月组成了所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”。富马内阁由于财政困难和亲美右派势力的压力，最后在1958年7月辞职。
    1958年，培·萨纳尼空上台执政，并且在1959年1月改组了内阁。按照美国的意旨，培·萨纳尼空新内阁的十四名阁员中包括了七名“保卫国家利益委员会”的成员。在这个彻头彻尾的亲美卖国政府组成以后，美国立即在今年2月指使它片面宣布废弃日内瓦协议，随后在5月间指使它重新挑起老挝内战。
    今年6月1日出版的美国“新闻周刊”把美国终于策动由它一手捧上台的培·萨纳尼空政府重新挑起内战的事实，描述为“近似奇迹的成就”。这家美国刊物得意忘形的流露正是美国干涉老挝的招供。
    在进行政治干涉的同时，美国不断违反日内瓦协议，把大批军事装备和军事人员运进老挝，供老挝反动亲美政权发动内战，并且把老挝变成美国的军事基地，以破坏印度支那的和平和威胁中国、越南民主共和国。据美国“华尔街日报”记者最近透露，“最近五年来，美国给老挝的军事援助和经济援助大约有二亿二千五百万美元。”应该指出，美国给予老挝的“援助”的绝大部分是“军事援助”，而“经济援助”的大部分也都用于军事目的。例如老挝警察的经费、美国在老挝建设战略公路和飞机场的费用都是在美国“经济援助”项下拨付的。
    美国还以“技术人员”、“雇员”等名义向老挝派遣了大批军事人员，以控制老挝的军队和军事基地。据万象的美国外交人士在8月8日透露，从今年7月25日起，已经有大约一百名美国军事人员到了万象。
    美国在对老挝进行军事干涉过程中，极力利用了东南亚条约组织。这个侵略集团曾经几次宣称老挝处于它的“保护地区”。而培·萨纳尼空政府对前寮国战斗部队的武装进攻，就是在今年4月这个侵略集团在惠灵顿会议上制定了干涉老挝的“蓝图”以后发动的。目前，美国正在加紧策划由东南亚条约组织出头去武装干涉老挝。美国操纵联合国安全理事会非法派遣“调查小组委员会”到老挝活动，就是为了替美国的对老挝进行国际干涉的计划制造“根据”。
    为了进一步扩大老挝内战，美国政府在8月26日公然决定给予培·萨纳尼空政府以大量武器和美元的“紧急援助”。根据这项“援助”计划，美国从8月31日起，一直不断地把大批军事装备运入老挝。美国太平洋武装部队司令费耳特的一名发言人透露，在这些军事装备中，有一部分是从日本运往老挝的。在输送这批军事装备时，美国租用了台湾蒋介石集团的飞机。
