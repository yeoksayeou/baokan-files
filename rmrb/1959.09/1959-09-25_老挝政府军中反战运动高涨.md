Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 23rd: According to "Lao Patriotic News" on September 16th, the anti-war movement within the Sananikone government army is growing. On August 20th, sixty soldiers stationed at Muang Ngern in Xieng Khouang province held a meeting to protest the Sananikone government's launching of a civil war, as well as the food shortages that left them hungry. They subsequently returned to their homes. The commander ordered the remaining fifty-two soldiers to shoot the deserters, but the soldiers refused to obey and instead tied the commander to a tree before also deserting along with the original sixty soldiers. Forty soldiers at the Nam Ngern post also deserted.

On September 6th, an officer and some soldiers at the An Kham post in Khammouane province, objecting to the commander's coercion of them to suppress the people, threw away their medals and insignia and fled.

In Phong Saly, on September 2nd, twenty soldiers and a company commander who were "sweeping" Nam Ngao defected to the people, bringing with them eight machine guns, twelve rifles, and a radio transmitter.

    老挝政府军中反战运动高涨
    新华社河内23日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”9月16日报道，萨纳尼空政府军队中的反战运动正在日益发展。川圹省芒银据点的六十名士兵8月20日举行了集会，抗议萨纳尼空政府发动内战，以及由于给养缺乏，使他们吃不饱。他们随后各自回家。指挥官命令其余的五十二名士兵向走散的士兵开枪，但这些士兵不肯听从，反而把指挥官绑在树上，然后也跟着那六十名士兵一起逃走。南更据点的四十名士兵也开了小差。
    甘蒙省安堪据点的一名军官和一些士兵9月6日因为反对指挥官强迫他们去镇压人民，把自己的勋章和领章扔掉逃走。
    在丰沙里，9月2日到南娥“扫荡”的二十名士兵和一个连长带着八挺机关枪、十二支步枪和一个无线电台向人民投诚。
