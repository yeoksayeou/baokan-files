Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 6th: Chongqing's two outstanding technical innovation experts, Communist Party members Liao Shigang and Wei Gaohou, inspired by the call of the Party Central Committee, have launched a competition to compare drive, innovation, and contribution. Following significant achievements in August, they have made a successful start in September.

Wei Gaohou, a young milling machine operator at the Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, proposed sixteen innovation suggestions from September 1st to 4th, implementing eleven of them. As a result, he completed eight of the fourteen varieties that should be processed in September in three and a half days, equivalent to more than a month's workload. Liao Shigang, a young milling machine operator at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, completed his daily plan on September 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, exceeding the plan by over 37% on the 2nd and 3rd. On the 1st and 4th, he went to support the generator workshop, which was facing production difficulties, and proposed twenty-six innovation suggestions aimed at key production problems, which are currently under study for implementation.

Liao Shigang and Wei Gaohou both entered the factory as mechanical workers in 1953 and joined the Party in 1956. Although they are not in the same factory, they share a common desire: to make more contributions to socialist construction. At the beginning of this year, they started competing, encouraging each other, learning from each other, and researching together, achieving brilliant results from January to July. Liao Shigang implemented 233 innovation suggestions from January to July, repeatedly breaking through major production bottlenecks in the workshop. Wei Gaohou implemented 290 innovation suggestions from January to July, breaking through 56 major bottlenecks, saving 430 tons of steel, and increasing production and saving 650,000 yuan for the country.

After the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, both revised their competition plans at the same time, deciding to complete the tasks for the last four months of this year in twenty days, implement more than 300 innovation suggestions, and help other workers improve their technical level and implement innovation suggestions. On August 26th, the two worked hard and cleverly, simultaneously implementing five innovation suggestions, creating new records of high output and high quality.

Starting on September 1st, the two devoted themselves to the production battle with greater enthusiasm. With the help of experienced workers, Wei Gaohou, after seven experiments, implemented a major innovation suggestion on the morning of the 1st: changing the "square tool holder" part of the old machine from forging to precision casting. Using the new method to process this batch of square tool holders can save 14 tons of metal materials, worth 65,000 yuan, and also free up manpower and machines to process other parts. On this day, Wei Gaohou completed more than twelve days of work. From the 2nd to the 4th, he searched for innovative methods in his own processing tasks and the processing tasks of others, creating amazing production results every day and driving his production team to over fulfill the plan every day.

On September 1st, Liao Shigang went to the generator production workshop, which had heavy tasks. Seeing that this workshop used large materials to process small parts, which was both time-consuming and wasteful of materials, he helped the workshop workers propose twenty-six suggestions for improving the processing methods for twenty-six types of processed parts to improve production efficiency and save materials. On the 2nd, the "claws" of the fixture used on his lathe were damaged due to insufficient hardness and could not continue production. He was quick-witted and found a way to overcome this temporary difficulty, resulting in exceeding the production plan for the day. On the 4th, after quickly completing his own production plan, he continued to help the generator workshop break through production bottlenecks.

### 革新能手比智比巧  廖世刚、魏高厚分别提出一批新建议

    革新能手比智比巧
    廖世刚、魏高厚分别提出一批新建议
    新华社重庆6日电　重庆市两位出色的技术革新能手、共产党员廖世刚和魏高厚，在党中央的号召鼓舞下，展开了比干劲、比革新、比贡献的对手竞赛，继8月份取得显著成绩之后，9月份又旗开得胜。
    重庆长安机器厂青年铣工魏高厚，9月1日至4日提出了十六项革新建议，实现了十一项，因此以三天半的时间完成了9月份应该加工的十四个品种中的八个品种，相当于一个月以上的工作量。重庆建设机床厂青年铣工廖世刚，9月2、3、4日都完成了日计划，2、3两日各超额37％以上。1日和4日，他到生产上遇到困难的发电机车间去支援，针对生产中的关键问题提出二十六项革新建议，正在研究实现中。
    廖世刚和魏高厚同在1953年进厂当机械工人，又同在1956年入党。他们虽然不在一个工厂，但却有一个共同的愿望：为建设社会主义多立功劳。今年一开头，他们就搭手较量，互相鼓励，互相学习，互相研究，1至7月份都取得辉煌成就。廖世刚1至7月份实现革新建议二百三十三件，屡次突破车间的重大生产关键；魏高厚1至7月份实现革新建议二百九十件，突破重大关键五十六项，节约钢材四百三十吨，为国家增产节约六十五万元。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，两人都同时修订了竞赛计划，都决定以二十天的时间完成今年最后四个月的任务，实现革新建议三百项以上，还要帮助其他工人提高技术水平，实现革新建议。8月26日，两人苦钻巧干，同时实现了五项革新建议，创造了高产优质的新纪录。
    9月1日开头，两人以更大的干劲投入生产战斗。魏高厚在老师傅们的协助下，经过七次试验，在1日早晨实现了一项重大的革新建议：将元车的零件“四方刀架”由锻工锻造改为精密铸造。用新的方法加工这批四方刀架，可以节约金属材料十四吨，价值六万五千元，还腾出了人力和机器加工别的零件。1日这一天，魏高厚却完成了十二天以上的工作量。2日到4日，他又在自己的加工任务和别人的加工任务上，找寻革新方法，每天都创造了惊人的生产成绩，并带动他的生产小组天天超额完成计划。
    廖世刚9月1日到任务繁重的发电机生产车间，看到这个车间用大材料加工小零件，既费工时又浪费材料，便帮助车间工人针对二十六种加工的零件，提出二十六项改进加工方法的建议，以提高生产效率和节省材料。2日，他车床上用的夹具“爪子”因硬度不够而损坏了不能继续生产，他情急智生，想办法克服了这一临时遇到的困难，结果超额完成了当天的生产计划。4日，他在迅速完成了自己的生产计划以后，又继续帮助发电机车间突破生产关键。
