Shanghai’s vigorous campaign to conserve coal, electricity, and petroleum is deepening step by step and has achieved significant results. The city saved 150,000 tons of coal in July and August, accounting for 60% of the total savings in the first half of the year; and saved over 12,000 tons of petroleum, accounting for more than half of the total savings in the first half of the year. There have also been significant savings in electricity.

In the first half of the year, the broad masses of workers in Shanghai paid close attention to conserving coal, electricity, and petroleum, which are the most widely used and consumed. After the Party Central Committee put forward the call to vigorously seize August and September to launch a high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, the enthusiasm of the city's workers and masses became even greater, and the conservation movement entered a new high tide. Industrial, transportation, and other systems have all focused on key points, cultivated typical examples, and established pacesetters, holding numerous on-site experience exchange meetings, with 45 meetings on coal conservation alone. After eight printing and dyeing factories in Luwan District held an on-site meeting at the Liming Printing and Dyeing Factory, they signed competition contracts on the spot. Subsequently, these eight factories adopted measures such as waste heat utilization, secondary gas recycling, "cutting off the appendix" (removing waste gas pipes), and "dressing" (wrapping asbestos around water heating pipes), which generally reduced coal consumption rates by more than 30%.

In the previous period, various departments focused on blocking loopholes and stopping waste in the conservation movement. Since the second half of the year, the broad masses of workers have mainly carried out large-scale technological innovations to achieve high output, high quality, and savings simultaneously. Workers at the Guoqiang Forging Factory dismantled the original old-fashioned stoves, built two reverberatory furnaces, improved the grates, shortened the distance between the hearth and the reverberatory chamber, and adopted methods such as water infiltration mixing and frequent ventilation, using a mixture of 50% white coal dust and bituminous coal. Because bituminous coal has long flames and white coal dust has strong firepower, the quality of the iron completely met the standards after the two types of coal were mixed and burned, while the output increased by one time, and the amount of coal burned only increased by 20%.

In terms of saving petroleum products, following the successful diesel-water mixture navigation by the No. 254 fishing vessel of the Marine Fisheries Brigade of the Aquatic Products Bureau, units such as the Shipping Bureau, Jiangnan Shipyard, and Diesel Engine Factory have also successfully experimented. They mixed about 10% of water into diesel engines of different styles and horsepower. Under the condition that the speed remained unchanged, the general savings of diesel could be about 10%. The Qingong Rubber Factory mixed 40% of water into gasoline to make rubber slurry, which not only saved a corresponding amount of gasoline, but also had good quality and was more convenient to operate.

The conservation movement has also promoted enterprise management. Many factories have established strict management systems for the use of coal, electricity, and petroleum, and have created many experiences. The Liming Printing and Dyeing Factory implemented a system of dedicated personnel in charge and established systems for coal acceptance, separate stacking according to variety, and weighing materials, completely eliminating coal shortage and consumption in July and August. They also established a daily statistical system for coal and gasoline consumption, which enabled workers to continuously improve operations and save coal with accurate analysis data. The Wool and Hemp Company improved the vehicle management system, and after adopting methods such as centralized dispatching, double-track transportation, and on-site parking, the phenomenon of empty vehicle trips was significantly reduced, and the effective mileage reached more than 60%. Units under the Municipal Commercial First and Second Bureaus also studied the rational use of vehicles and the increase of effective vehicle mileage. Units such as the Suburban Wholesale Department of the Zhongbai Company and the Municipal Vegetable Company launched cooperative transportation with empty vehicles, which not only reduced the empty vehicle rate but also accelerated the turnover of goods and solved the problem of insufficient transportation capacity.

Currently, relevant departments in Shanghai, including some scientific research units, are vigorously promoting these experiences and are further studying the expansion of the use of low-quality coal, the mixing of water into oil and transformer oil, and the rational use of electricity.

    从着重堵塞漏洞发展到着重革新技术
    上海节约煤电油步步深入
    本报讯　上海市雷厉风行节约煤、电、石油的活动正在步步深入，并已收到了显著效果。全市7、8月份节约煤十五万吨，为上半年节约总数的60％；节约石油一万二千余吨，为上半年节约总数的一半以上。电力亦有很大的节约。
    上半年，上海市广大职工十分注意节约使用面最广、使用量最大的煤、电、石油。在党中央提出大抓8、9两个月开展增产节约高潮的号召以后，全市职工群众的干劲更足，节约运动又进入新高潮。各工业、交通运输业等系统都抓住重点、培养典型、树立标兵，召开了多次现场经验交流会，仅在节约煤炭方面，即有四十五次。卢湾区八个印染厂在丽明印染厂开了现场会议以后，当场签订了竞赛合同，随后这八个厂采取废热利用、二气回用和“割盲肠”（割除废气管）、“穿衣裳”（在水汀管外包石棉）等措施，耗煤率普遍降低了30％以上。
    前一时期，各部门在节约运动中，着重于堵塞漏洞、制止浪费。下半年来，广大职工主要是通过大搞技术革新，做到高产、优质、节约齐头并进。国强锻炼厂工人拆除了原始的老式炉灶，砌成二只反射炉，改进炉排，缩短炉膛和反射室之间的距离，采用渗水拌和和勤通风等方法，以50％白煤屑与烟煤掺烧。由于烟煤火苗长，白煤屑火力强，二种煤混合烧以后，铁的质量完全符合标准，产量却增长一倍，烧煤量仅增加二成。
    在节约石油产品方面，继水产局海洋渔业捕捞队二五四号渔轮创柴油掺水航行成功以后，航务局、江南造船厂和柴油机厂等单位，也先后试验成功。他们在不同式样、不同马力的柴油机上掺用10％上下的水，在转速不变的情况下，一般可节约柴油10％左右。勤工橡胶厂以40％的水掺入汽油内打胶浆，除节约了相应数量的汽油外，质量良好，操作也较方便。
    节约运动同时也促进了企业管理，许多工厂建立了严格的管理煤、电、石油的使用制度，并创造了很多经验。丽明印染厂实行了专人负责，并建立了煤炭验收、按品种分别堆放、过磅领料等制度，7、8月份完全消灭了煤炭缺耗。他们还建立了用煤、用汽油的逐日统计制度，使工人不断改进操作、节约煤炭有了正确的分析资料。毛麻公司改进了车辆管理制度，采取集中调度、复线运输、现场停车等方法以后，车辆放空现象显著降低，有效里程达到60％以上。市商业一、二局所属单位，也就合理使用车辆、提高车辆有效里程问题作了研究，中百公司郊区批发部和市蔬菜公司等单位，展开空车协作运输，不仅减少了车辆放空率，而且加速了商品周转，解决了运输能力不足的问题。
    目前，上海市有关部门，包括一些科学研究单位，正在大力推广这些经验，并进一步就扩大低质煤使用范围，机油、变压器油掺水和合理用电等问题进行研究。
