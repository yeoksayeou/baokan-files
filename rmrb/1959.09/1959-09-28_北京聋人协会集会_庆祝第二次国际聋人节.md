Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Today, the Beijing Deaf Association held a gathering at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall to celebrate the Second International Day of the Deaf.

At the celebration, Beijing Vice Mayor Wu Han extended holiday greetings to the deaf and mute on behalf of the people of the capital. He said that under the leadership of the Party, the welfare work for the deaf and mute in Beijing has greatly developed. 90% of the deaf and mute who are capable of labor have participated in work and made great achievements. This fully shows that in socialist countries, the deaf and mute can completely become laborers who are disabled but not useless, self-reliant, and contribute to the great socialist construction cause.

The World Federation of the Deaf has decided that the fourth Sunday of September each year will be International Day of the Deaf.

Tonight, deaf and mute people throughout the city held a party, and deaf and mute people performed entertainment programs.
