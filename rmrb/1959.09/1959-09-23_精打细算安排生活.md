    Arranging Life Meticulously
    The "Resolution on Launching a Production Increase and Thrift Campaign" from the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party calls upon the people of the whole country to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, launch a vigorous mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, and complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, within this year; at the same time, it requires the people of the whole country to "not only be good at arranging production, but also be good at arranging life, know how to manage the household, be meticulous in planning, and leave reserves." This call from the Party Central Committee has been warmly responded to by the people of the whole country. In the heat of the production increase and thrift campaign, diligence and frugality have become a new social trend. The residents of Jingwei Street in Daoli District, Harbin City, who have been rated as advanced units in social conservation for three consecutive years, and Jiang Yumei, a model of thrift from Qijiabu Production Team of the Qiji People's Commune in Jimo County, Shandong, published in this newspaper today, are outstanding examples. Facts show that whether among urban residents or commune members in people's communes, promoting thrift and properly arranging life while striving to increase production is the way to national prosperity and abundant livelihood.
    Frugal housekeeping includes both diligence and thrift. Diligence means increasing production in many ways; thrift means saving in many ways. Being meticulous in planning in family life, implementing the spirit of diligence and frugality, being good at arranging life, and knowing how to manage the household are not only matters for every family and individual, but also related to the gradual improvement of the lives of the people across the country. Whether individuals and families are diligent and frugal or extravagant is naturally closely related to the country. Therefore, nation-building and housekeeping are unified, and the prosperity of the country is closely linked to the happiness of family life. If every family can pay attention to saving bit by bit in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, it will inevitably save huge materials for the country. Our country has a large population, and if everyone is meticulous in planning and saves a little, it adds up to a large amount. For example, if each person saves one jin of grain per month, the country will save seven or eight billion jin of grain a year; again, if each person saves five jiao per month, the country will save three or four billion yuan a year. According to statistics from the People's Bank of China, urban savings deposits across the country increased by more than 75 million yuan in August compared to July. With the deepening of the production increase and thrift campaign, the savings business will surely have greater development. In this way, in addition to mainly relying on the accumulation of state-owned enterprises, the funds for socialist construction can also concentrate the money scattered in the hands of everyone, which can accelerate socialist construction.
    However, not everyone understands the great significance of being meticulous in planning, managing the household diligently and frugally, properly arranging life, and knowing how to manage the household. Some people think that China's economy has greatly developed, especially with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, and this year continues to leap forward. As long as we increase production, why bother with meticulous planning, calculating every ounce and every penny? This view is wrong. It should be fully recognized that increasing production is important. Without increasing production and simply relying on saving, no matter how much you save, it will not add new wealth to society. However, if you do not pay attention to saving after increasing production, the fruits of increased production will also be wasted. As the saying goes, "Diligence and thrift make a family prosperous, and proper use of money makes the flow last long." Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his political report at the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "In all enterprises, in all state organs, and in the entire social life, it is necessary to continue to advocate thrift and overcome waste. Waste is always an obstacle to the development of production and the improvement of life." This means that diligence and thrift, and opposition to waste, are not only what we need now, but also what we will need in the future communist society. It is just that at that time, the people's living standards will be generally improved, and the standard of saving will be different from what it is now.
    Some people think that saving is naturally a good thing, but their own consumption is limited, and saving a little bit of something will not be of much use in promoting the cause of socialist construction. Indeed, if viewed in isolation, saving a little something by one or a few people is indeed of very limited use, but if the things saved by everyone are accumulated, it will be a considerable amount. The residents of Jingwei Street in Daoli District, Harbin, manage their households according to the principle of "living a rich life as if it were a poor life," and properly arrange their lives. Over time, in the first half of this year alone, the entire street saved more than 583,000 jin of grain, 2,626 tons of coal, more than 98,000 jin of wood, and more than 8,000 chi of cloth. More than 80% of the 9,700 households on the street have savings in the bank. This fact fully illustrates the principle of "many a little makes a mickle." If the people in urban and rural areas across the country can be as meticulous in planning as the residents of Jingwei Street, paying attention to saving bit by bit everywhere, what a big number that would be? Saving starts from a little bit, and what the residents of Jingwei Street can do, all families and individuals across the country can certainly do.
    Some people think that frugal housekeeping means lowering the standard of living. This is a misunderstanding. Frugal housekeeping means being diligent and thrifty, opposing extravagance and waste, requiring us to remove the wasteful and extravagant parts from our current standard of living, and save the money that is temporarily not used in the bank to support national construction. The ultimate goal of national production and construction is still to improve the people's lives. Therefore, consuming less now is precisely for a better life in the future, not to lower the standard of living. From a long-term perspective, this is precisely to improve our standard of living. It should be recognized that our lives can only gradually rise with the development of production, and cannot reach the sky in one step. This is because production is the basis of consumption. Without developing production and greatly increasing social wealth, there is no material basis for improving life. We advocate saving precisely to develop production and to strengthen the material basis for improving life.
    Some people also think that in the past, people had no security and had to guard against old age, illness, and unemployment. Now, factories have labor insurance and pensions, and rural areas have social relief and homes for the elderly. There is no need to "guard" against anything anymore, so it doesn't matter if you don't save. Naturally, our current situation is fundamentally different from the past, but we must not therefore conclude that no one needs to be meticulous in planning and leave reserves. If we do not have reserves at ordinary times, we will encounter difficulties when we encounter special needs. In actual life, two situations often arise: under circumstances where the amount of income and family burden are similar, some people live well, while others, because they hold the idea that social insurance will prevent them from starving anyway, are not good at arranging life and do not know how to manage the household, and often encounter difficulties. In this way, it will not only affect personal life and family unity, but also affect their own production and work mood, and increase the burden on the country. It can be seen that not arranging life, not paying attention to saving, and not leaving reserves are not only unfavorable to individuals, but also unfavorable to production and work, and unfavorable to the country. As the ancients said, "It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality." It is very easy for a person to get into the habit of extravagance and waste. And the habit of saving must be cultivated unremittingly. Therefore, at any time, we should have the spirit of "always thinking of having nothing when you have something, and not thinking of having something when you have nothing," properly arrange life, and manage the household diligently and frugally.
    Caring for the masses and helping the masses arrange their lives can only be done in a country where the people are the masters under the leadership of the Communist Party. In the old society, a small number of rulers lived extravagant lives, while the broad masses of working people suffered from cruel oppression and exploitation, lived difficult and impoverished lives, and were threatened by hunger, cold, poverty, unemployment, and the threat of birth, old age, illness, and death. Now, our situation is completely different from the old society. Unemployment, poverty, pawning, and selling land can no longer threaten us. We are now not only able to eat our fill and keep warm, but our lives are getting better and better. Now, the whole country is a scene of prosperity and prosperity. However, we should understand that our country was originally a poor and backward country with a very thin foundation. And our goal is to change the poor and backward face of our country in the shortest possible time and build a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Although our socialist construction has achieved great achievements, there is still a long way to go before we achieve this great goal. Therefore, we must continue to carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle and build our country diligently and thriftily. Further carrying forward the fine tradition of diligence and frugal housekeeping of our working people, and practicing strict economy, is first of all the responsibility of all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and revolutionary cadres. We should set an example in this regard. Every family, young and old, should develop the habit of diligence and thrift. Women are the masters of housework, controlling the consumption of firewood, rice, oil, and salt in the family, and planning clothing, food, housing, and transportation, so housewives are also the main force in promoting diligent and frugal housekeeping. Diligent and frugal housekeeping should be said to be a practical action for women to participate in diligent and frugal nation-building. Every woman should strive to be a model and expert in diligent and frugal housekeeping. Other members of each family should also work together with the masters of housework to save money and use it sparingly. We believe that if every household is meticulous in planning, properly arranges life, and manages the household diligently and frugally, we will surely enable socialist construction to achieve faster development. With the development of production, our lives will gradually improve, and our people will become more and more prosperous, more and more happy, and more and more happy.

    精打细算安排生活
    党的八届八中全会“关于开展增产节约运动的决议”中，号召全国人民反右倾、鼓干劲，开展一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动，提前三年，在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标；同时要求全国人民，“不但要善于安排生产，而且要善于安排生活，会过日子，精打细算，留有后备”。党中央的这个号召，已得到了全国人民的热烈响应。在热火朝天的增产节约运动中，勤劳节俭更成为社会的新风尚。今天本报发表的连续三年被评为市、区社会节约先进单位的哈尔滨市道里区经纬街的居民们和山东即墨县七级人民公社綦家埠生产队社员节约模范姜玉美，就是突出的例子。事实表明，不论在城市的居民中和人民公社的社员中，在努力增产的同时，提倡节约，妥善地安排生活，学会过日子，这是国富民丰之道。
    勤俭持家包括勤和俭两个方面。勤，就是要多方面增产；俭，就是要多方面节约。在家庭生活上精打细算，贯彻勤俭持家的精神，善于安排生活，会过日子，这不仅是一切家庭和个人的事情，同时也是关系到全国人民生活的逐步改善。个人和家庭是勤俭还是奢侈，自然同国家息息相关。所以，建国和持家是统一的，国家的富强是和家庭生活的幸福密切相联的。如果每个家庭都能从衣、食、住、行各方面注意一点一滴的节约，则必然给国家节约出巨大的物资。我国人口众多，每个人都精打细算，节约一点，聚集起来就是一个很大的数目。例如每人每月节约一斤粮食，全国一年就节约七、八十亿斤粮食；又如每人每月节约五角钱，全国一年就省下三、四十亿元。根据人民银行的统计，八月份全国城镇储蓄存款就比七月份增加七千五百多万元。随着增产节约运动的深入开展，储蓄事业一定会有更大的发展。这样，社会主义的建设资金除了主要地依靠国营企业的积累以外，还可以把分散在每个人手中的钱集中起来，这就可以加速地进行社会主义建设。
    但是，对于精打细算，勤俭持家，妥善地安排生活，学会过日子，并不是所有人都了解它的重大意义的。有的人认为：我国的经济已大大地发展了，尤其是1958年我国工农业生产大跃进，今年又继续跃进，只要多增产就行，何必再去斤斤两两、点点滴滴地精打细算？这种看法是不对的。完全应当承认，增产是重要的，如果没有增产而单纯地依靠节约，无论怎样节约也不会给社会增加新的财富。不过，如果增产之后不注意节约，那么也会把增产的果实浪费掉。谚语说得好：“勤俭治家家业盛，正当用钱细水长”。刘少奇同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上的政治报告中指出：“在一切企业中，在一切国家机关中，在整个社会生活中，都必须继续提倡节约，克服浪费。浪费在任何时候都是妨碍生产的发展和生活的改善的。”这就是说，勤俭节约，反对浪费，不仅现在是我们需要的，就是将来到共产主义社会，同样也是需要的，只是在那个时候人民生活水平普遍提高了，节约的标准同现在不同而已。
    有的人认为：节约自然是好事，可是自己的消费有限，节约一星半点的东西，对促进社会主义建设事业也不会有多大用处。的确，如果孤立起来看，一个或几个人节约一点东西，用处也实在有限得很，但是，如果把大家节约的东西聚积起来，那么就是一个很可观的数目。哈尔滨道里区经纬街的居民们，按着“富日子当穷日子过”的道理持家，妥善地安排生活，日积月累，仅今年上半年全街共节约了五十八万三千多斤粮食，二千六百二十六吨煤，九万八千多斤木材，八千多尺布，全街九千七百多户中有80％以上的户在银行有存款。这个事实充分地说明了
  “集腋成裘”的道理。如果全国城乡人民都能像经纬街居民一样，处处精打细算，点点滴滴地注意节约，那又是一个多么大的数字？节约就是从一点一滴做起的，经纬街居民能做到的，全国所有家庭和个人也一定能做到。
  有的人认为：勤俭持家就是要降低生活水平。这是一种误解。勤俭持家就是勤劳节俭，反对铺张浪费，要我们在现在的生活水平上，去掉浪费奢侈的部分，把暂时不用的钱存到银行里去，支援国家建设。国家生产建设的最终目的仍然是为了改善人民生活。所以现在少消费一些，正是为了将来生活更好一些，并不是要降低生活水平。从长远利益来看，这正是为了提高我们的生活水平。应该认识到，我们的生活，只能随着生产的发展逐步上升，而不能一步登天。这是因为生产是消费的基础，不发展生产，大量增加社会财富，提高生活就没有物质基础。我们提倡节约，正是为了发展生产，为了增强改善生活的物质基础。
    有的人还认为：从前人们生活没有保障，要防老、防病、防失业，现在，工厂有劳动保险，有退休金，农村有社会救济，有敬老院，不需要再“防”什么的了，因此不节约也没有什么关系。自然，我们现在的情况同过去是根本不同了，但决不能因此就得出结论说，不论任何人都不需要精打细算，留有后备。如果我们平时不留有后备，一遇到特别需要，就会发生困难。在实际生活中常常会出现这样两种情况：在彼此的收入数量、家庭负担相差不多的情况下，有的人生活过得很好，有的人由于抱着有社会保险反正不会挨饿的思想，因而不善于安排生活，不会过日子，经常发生困难，这样，不但要影响个人生活，影响家庭团结，而且还会影响自己的生产和工作的情绪，增加国家负担。可见，不会安排生活，不注意节约，不留有后备，不但对个人不利，而且对生产和工作不利，对国家不利。古人说得好：“由俭入奢易，由奢入俭难”。一个人沾染上奢侈浪费的习惯是非常容易的。而节约的习惯就要坚持不懈地养成。因此，任何时候我们应该有“常将有日思无日，莫待无时想有时”的精神，妥善地安排生活，勤俭持家。
    关心群众，帮助群众安排过日子，这只有在共产党领导的人民当家作主的国家才能做到。在旧社会，少数统治者过着奢侈的日子，广大劳动人民受着残酷的压迫和剥削，过着艰难困苦的日子，受着饥饿、寒冷、贫困、失业，以及生老病死的威胁。现在，我们的情况与旧社会是完全不同了。失业、贫困、典当、卖地再也不能威胁我们了，我们现在不但能吃饱穿暖，而且生活过得越来越好。现在，全国是一片繁荣兴盛的景象。但是，我们应该懂得，我国原来是一个贫穷落后的国家，家底很薄。而我们的目的是要在尽可能短的时间内改变我国的贫穷落后的面貌，建成一个具有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代化科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国。我们的社会主义建设虽然已经取得了伟大的成就，可是，离我们实现这个伟大的目标，还有一段很长的距离。因此，我们必须继续发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，克勤克俭地建设我们的国家。进一步发扬我国劳动人民勤俭持家的优良传统，厉行节约，首先是一切共产党员、共青团员和革命干部的责任，我们应当在这方面作模范。每个家庭的男女老少都要养成勤俭的习惯。妇女是家务的主持者，掌握着家庭柴米油盐的消费和衣食住行的筹划，所以家庭妇女又是推行勤俭持家的主要力量。勤俭持家应当说是妇女参与勤俭建国的实际行动，每个妇女应当争取当个勤俭持家的模范和能手。每个家庭的其他成员也应当与家务主持者同心合力，省吃俭用。我们相信，家家户户都精打细算，妥善地安排生活，勤俭持家，我们就一定可以使社会主义建设获得更快的发展。生产发展了，我们的生活也将逐步得到改善，我们人民将越过越富裕、越美满、越幸福。
