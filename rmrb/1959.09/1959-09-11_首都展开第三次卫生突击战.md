Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Following the victories of the first two health campaigns, the people of the capital today launched the third health campaign. The central tasks of this campaign and the upcoming fourth campaign are to rectify the appearance of the city, vigorously promote environmental sanitation, completely eliminate mosquitoes and flies, and greet National Day in a clean and tidy manner.

　　This morning, cadres from government offices, students, and residents all joined the battle, vigorously rectifying the appearance of the city and promoting environmental sanitation. Many neighborhood committees organized city appearance rectification work groups and shock teams. In the Erlong Road subdistrict of the Xicheng District, more than 60 people inspected and cleaned up broken bricks, tiles, weeds, and potholes on more than 30 major streets. Many construction sites are carrying out final project work, also clearing on-site debris and stockpiled materials, requiring the sites to be clean. Cleaning teams have also strengthened street patrols.

　　The third campaign lasts from today to the 12th. The fourth campaign will be from the 17th until National Day. The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee held an enlarged meeting a few days ago and made specific arrangements for this.

    首都展开第三次卫生突击战
    新华社10日讯　首都人民在获得前两个卫生战役的胜利后，今天起展开了第三次卫生突击战役。这次战役和不久将展开的第四次战役的中心任务，是整顿市容，大搞环境卫生，彻底消灭蚊蝇，干干净净迎接国庆节。
    今天清晨，机关干部、学生和居民等，都纷纷投入战斗，大力整顿市容，大搞环境卫生。许多居民委员会组织了整顿市容工作组和突击队。西城区二龙路办事处有六十多人分别在三十多个主要街道上边检查边清理碎砖烂瓦、杂草、坑洼。许多建筑工地正在作工程收尾工作。也在清除现场上碴土和堆料，要求做到场光地净。清洁队也加强了街道的巡回保洁工作。
    第三次战役是今天起到12日止。从17日到国庆节前将是第四次战役。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会在日前召开扩大会议，对此作了具体布置。
