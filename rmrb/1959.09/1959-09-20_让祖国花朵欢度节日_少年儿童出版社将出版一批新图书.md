To allow the broad masses of children to enjoy reading during the National Day celebrations, the Children's Publishing House will publish a series of new books in September to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	In this batch of books, the "I Love My Motherland Little Series" selects representative events from the most important aspects of the motherland's construction that are easy to arouse children's interest. The content is rich and the writing is lively.

	In the book "Scientists Talk About the 21st Century," more than 20 well-known scientists and engineers such as Li Siguang, Hua Luogeng, and Mao Yisheng tell young children about the prospects for scientific development. Readers can see from the book: how people will conquer nature and become the masters of nature, explore the distant world of stars, artificially control the climate, create newer and more convenient means of transportation, eliminate diseases, and so on. It can inspire children's scientific ideals and guide their interest in science.

	The "Selected Children's Literature," compiled by the Shanghai Ten-Year Literature Anthology Editorial Board, selects more than 40 outstanding children's literature works from Shanghai in the past ten years, including various literary forms and a wide range of subjects: some reflect the suffering and misery of children in old China; some describe how their fathers bravely fought against the reactionary rule at the time through the memories of the children of martyrs; some describe the past revolutionary struggles; and some reflect the happy life of children after liberation and their love for the motherland and their collective cause...; "Selected New Children's Songs in Shanghai," compiled by Zhang Lihui, Ding Jingtang, etc., includes 80 new children's songs popular in Shanghai in recent years. These children's songs have the spirit of the times and are full of ideology and artistry. In addition, there are novels with revolutionary traditional education as the theme, such as "Looking for the Red Army" and "Battle in the Dense Forest," and novels reflecting children's lives, such as "New Deskmates."

	In order to comprehensively and systematically introduce the works of outstanding Soviet children's literature writers, the Children's Publishing House will also publish the "Gaidar Selected Works" and Marshak's "Poems for Children." "Gaidar Selected Works" will be published in two volumes. The first volume will be published before the National Day, including works such as "Revolutionary Military Commission," "School," "Fourth Air-Raid Shelter," "The Faraway Land," and "Let It Shine." The book "Poems for Children" includes more than a dozen fairy tale poems written by Marshak for younger children, with color illustrations by famous Soviet painters. The book also includes a preface written by the old poet for Chinese readers. In terms of translated literature, Pushkin's fairy tale poem "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish," translated by Ge Baoquan, will also be published.

	Books published for lower grades of elementary school and preschool children include: "Hercules," which vividly introduces the labor of worker uncles to children through beautiful poems and pictures, such as lathe workers, planers, welders...; "The Motherland Has Beautiful Scenery Everywhere," which praises the motherland's magnificent socialist construction in the form of poetry; "Chinese Dolls and American Friends," through the encounters of a Chinese doll in the United States, allows children to see the abominable nature of the American reactionaries. There are also "Picking Up Grain," "Do Your Own Things," and "Xiao Lin's Manure Accumulation" with the theme of labor education, the animal story "Friends" with the theme of unity and mutual assistance, and "The Story of Comrade Fang Zhimin's Childhood," which introduces the childhood of martyrs, and "Black Water," which depicts the lives of children in coal mining areas.
