Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from New York: Similar to the situation in the steel industry, the coal industries of major capitalist countries are currently experiencing a slump characterized by reduced production, increased inventories, and a significant rise in unemployment.

    The coal industry in the United States has long been mired in a chronic crisis. According to recent figures released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. coal production index for the first half of this year was 72 (with the average for 1947-1949 being 100), meaning it was less than three-quarters of the level it was a decade ago.

    In July of this year, U.S. coal production declined sharply, with the production index falling to 56, a decrease of 13% compared to July of last year and 24% compared to June of this year. The sharp decline in U.S. coal production is partly due to the 500,000 steelworkers' strike, which significantly reduced the amount of coal used by the steel industry, but more fundamentally, it is due to the shrinking market and lack of sales. "Outlook" magazine recently reported that the demand for lignite in the United States has decreased by half in the past thirty-five years.

    Due to sluggish sales, U.S. coal mine capitalists have laid off large numbers of workers. This spring, the number of employees in the U.S. coal mining industry decreased by 25,000 compared to the same period last year.

    In Britain, British coal production in the first 27 weeks of this year decreased by 4% compared to the same period last year, a reduction of 4 million tons, while coal inventories increased by nearly 5 million tons compared to the end of last year. Due to coal unsold, the British National Coal Board recently decided to close approximately 240 coal mines, which is nearly one-third of the total number of coal mines in Britain.

    In Western Europe, the "Coal and Steel Community" six countries produced only 137 million tons of coal from January to July this year, a decrease of 6% compared to the same period last year. The largest decrease was in Belgium, from 16.4 million tons to 13.1 million tons, a decrease of about 20%; West Germany decreased by 6.3%, and France decreased by 0.6%. While production decreased, the group's coal reserves continued to increase, from 20 million tons in July of last year to 32 million tons in July of this year.

### 生产低落销路缺乏工人减少  资本主义国家煤业不景气

    生产低落销路缺乏工人减少
    资本主义国家煤业不景气
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：同钢铁工业的情况一样，资本主义世界各主要国家的煤矿业目前也处在生产减少，存货增加和失业人数大大上升的不景气状态。
    美国的煤矿业长期以来一直处于慢性的危机而不能自拔。根据美国商务部最近发表的数字，在今年上半年，美国煤的生产指数是七十二（1947—1949年的平均数为一百），就是说还不到十年前的水平的四分之三。
    在今年7月份，美国煤的生产更是急剧下降，生产指数降到五十六，即比去年7月份的水平减少了13％，比今年6月份的水平减少了24％。美国煤的生产的剧烈下降，一方面是因为五十万钢铁工人大罢工使钢铁工业用煤大大减少，但更根本的方面还是由于市场日益狭窄，产品缺乏销路。美国“展望”杂志最近曾经报道，最近三十五年来，美国褐煤的需求量减少了一倍。
    由于销路不景，美国煤矿资本家大量解雇工人。今年春季，美国煤矿业的就业人数比去年同期减少了二万五千人。
    在英国，今年头二十七个星期的英国煤产量比去年同期下降了4％，即减少了四百万吨，而煤的存货却比去年年底增加了近五百万吨。由于煤的滞销，英国国家煤业局最近已决定关闭大约二百四十座煤矿，这个数目将近英国煤矿总数的三分之一。
    在西欧，“煤钢联营集团”六国今年从1月到7月的煤产量只达到一亿三千七百万吨，比去年同期减少了6％，其中减产最多的是比利时，从一千六百四十万吨减少到一千三百十万吨，减产了20％左右；西德减产6.3％，法国减产0.6％。在生产减少的同时，这个集团的存煤却不断增加，这个集团存煤已经从去年7月的二千万吨增加到今年7月的三千二百万吨。
