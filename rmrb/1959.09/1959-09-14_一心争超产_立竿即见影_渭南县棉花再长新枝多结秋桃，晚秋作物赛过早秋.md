(Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an on the 13th) Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, is enthusiastically launching an autumn overproduction campaign with the goal of "increasing cotton production by ten to fifteen *jin* of ginned cotton per *mu* and increasing autumn grain production by thirty *jin* per *mu*," striving for a county-wide increase of 6.2 million to 9.3 million *jin* of ginned cotton and an increase of 23 million *jin* of autumn grain.

Although Weinan County suffered severe drought this year, the people of the county, after more than fifty days of struggle, have basically overcome the disaster, and the autumn fields are still a scene of abundant harvest. According to surveys in various places, the county's more than 620,000 *mu* of cotton fields have an average of 2,500 to 3,000 plants per *mu*, with an average of about ten cotton bolls per plant, and an estimated yield of 73 *jin* of ginned cotton per *mu*. The late autumn grain crops cover more than 770,000 *mu*, and the yield per *mu* can also approach the planned amount. People are very clearly seeing that, following the summer harvest, autumn will also be a great harvest.

The Weinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, mobilized the masses on such a successful foundation to launch an autumn overproduction campaign. The specific requirements are: each cotton plant should grow two more autumn bolls, increasing production by ten to fifteen *jin* of ginned cotton per *mu*, and each *mu* of late crops should increase production by thirty *jin* of autumn grain. Party organizations at all levels of communes, management districts, and production teams enthusiastically responded to this call. On the one hand, they examined any slackening thoughts, and on the other hand, they organized propaganda teams to go deep into the fields to publicize the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee to the masses. At the same time, they widely organized debate meetings and field comparison meetings. At these meetings, by presenting facts and reasoning, the masses further realized that as long as the superior conditions of the commune are fully utilized, both severe droughts can be overcome and autumn overproduction can be guaranteed. The masses also analyzed how to turn the unfavorable condition of drought into a favorable condition for overproduction. The masses generally believe that, first, the drought has forced people to have soaring enthusiasm; second, the drought has slowed the decrease in ground temperature compared to previous years, delaying the maturity of late autumn crops. As long as we continue to add water and fertilizer and cultivate to preserve moisture, we can promote increased production of autumn crops.

From August 27th, a massive autumn overproduction campaign was launched. A total of 260,000 male and female commune members in the county, led by party secretaries at all levels, reinstalled windlasses, waterwheels, and pumps in the fields, watering late autumn crops day and night. In some places, women and primary school students were holding basins and jars, lining up along the riverbank and well platforms to carry water to irrigate cotton and late corn. The cotton fields and cornfields were full of people, picking new cotton and harvesting early autumn crops, while also applying top dressing and preventing insect pests to cotton and late autumn crops. The production teams of the Shuangwang Management District of the Chengguan Commune conducted inspections and comparisons of cotton fields and, based on the inspection results, classified and ranked them, proposing overproduction plans for each plot to ensure that each plant grows three to five more old bolls, striving for a yield of 120 to 150 *jin* of ginned cotton per *mu* in the cotton fields of the entire management district. Additional overproduction measures were also added to the late corn, with a universal watering and top dressing to strive for an overproduction of 70 *jin* of grain per *mu*. After the hard work of the male and female commune members of the entire management district, new branches have generally grown on the cotton, and new flower buds have emerged. On average cotton fields, four or five flower buds have been added per plant, and in high-yield cotton fields, more than a dozen flower buds have been added per plant. In the high-yield cotton fields of Zhang Qiuxiang, Xue Junxiu, Lu Yumei, and others, the most added was as many as fifty flower buds. The late corn processed by the Shuangwang Management District is growing even better than the early corn, and it is predicted that each *mu* can yield 650 to 700 *jin*. The management districts of the Gaotang Commune held overproduction campaign mobilization rallies, proposing that 46,540 *mu* of corn would guarantee an overproduction of 1.43 million *jin*, and more than 2,300 *mu* of rice would increase production by 90 *jin* per *mu*. After the overproduction plans and increased production measures were implemented in each production team, the teams competed to launch overproduction competitions. The teams exchanged information every day and announced the results every night, promoting the overproduction campaign to a climax.

In this overproduction campaign, party secretaries and cadres at all levels went deep into the fields to labor with the masses. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, in this movement, carried forward the Party's glorious tradition, going wherever it was most difficult. Therefore, they were responsible for managing the third-class autumn fields with poor conditions and arduous work tasks. For example, the first and second-class corn in the Tuopo Management District of Huazhou Commune were distributed to the masses for management, and more than 1,010 *mu* of third-class corn remained. People thought that the conditions were poor and difficult to manage, so more than 800 party and Youth League members automatically took charge of these third-class cornfields, and proposed that no matter how many difficulties there were, the third-class corn must be upgraded.

At present, although it is already late autumn, a scene rarely seen in the past has appeared in the fields of Weinan County: in the cotton fields, there is a field of red flowers above and a field of white cotton below. The cotton farmers are picking white cotton while strengthening management to promote the growth of more autumn bolls. The peasants excitedly said: "This is a scene of harvest! Let's work harder, strive to exceed the overproduction plan, and welcome National Day!"

### 一心争超产　立竿即见影  渭南县棉花再长新枝多结秋桃，晚秋作物赛过早秋

    一心争超产　立竿即见影
    渭南县棉花再长新枝多结秋桃，晚秋作物赛过早秋
    本报西安13日电　陕西渭南县热烈展开“每亩棉田增产十至十五斤皮棉，每亩秋田增产三十斤粮”的秋季超产运动，力争全县增产皮棉六百二十万斤至九百三十万斤，增产秋粮二千三百万斤。
    渭南县今年虽然遭受了严重的旱灾，但是，全县人民经过五十余天奋斗，基本上战胜了灾害，秋田仍是一片丰收景象。据各地调查，全县六十二万多亩棉田，平均每亩有二千五百至三千株，平均每株有棉桃十个左右，预计亩产七十三斤皮棉；晚秋粮食作物共有七十七万多亩，亩产也可以接近计划。人们都非常清楚的看到，继夏季丰收之后，秋季又将是一个大丰收。
    中共渭南县委根据八届八中全会的精神，在这样一个丰收的基础上，发动群众，开展秋季超产运动。具体要求是：每株棉花再增加两个秋桃、每亩增产十至十五斤皮棉，每亩晚庄稼增产三十斤秋粮。各公社、管理区和生产队的党组织热烈响应了这个号召，一面检查松劲思想，一面组织宣传大军，深入田间，向群众宣传党的八中全会的精神。同时广泛地组织了辩论会和田间评比会。在这些会上，通过摆事实、讲道理，使群众进一步认识到：只要充分发挥了公社的优越条件，既能战胜严重的旱灾，也能保证秋季超产。群众还分析了把旱灾这个不利的条件，变为对超产的有利条件。群众普遍认为，第一，干旱逼起人们的冲天干劲；第二，旱灾使地温降低的比往年慢，推迟了晚秋作物的成熟期，只要继续加水加肥、中耕保墒，就可以促使秋庄稼增产。
    从8月27日起，一个声势浩大的秋季超产运动就展开了，全县共有二十六万男女社员在各级党委书记率领下，在田间，重新安装起辘轳、水车、水泵，日夜浇灌晚秋作物。有的地方，妇女和小学生都拿着盆盆罐罐，一排排的在河边、井台端水，浇灌棉花和晚玉米。棉田里和玉米地里到处是人，他们一面摘新棉、收早秋，一面给棉田、晚秋作物施追肥、防虫害。城关公社双王管理区各生产队，对棉田进行了检查评比，并根据检查的情况分类排队，逐块提出超产计划，保证每株再长三至五个老桃，力争全管理区棉田亩产一百二十斤至一百五十斤皮棉。对晚玉米也追加了超产措施，普遍浇水追肥一次，争取每亩超产七十斤粮。经过全管理区男女社员的奋战，现在棉花普遍长出新的枝节，开出新的花蕾。一般的棉田每株增加四、五个花蕾，丰产棉田每株增加十几个花蕾。张秋香、薛俊秀、卢玉梅等的高额丰产棉田里，增加最多的竟达五十多个花蕾。双王管理区经过加工后的晚玉米，比早玉米生长得还好，预测每亩可收六百五十斤至七百斤。高塘公社各管理区分别举行了超产运动誓师大会，他们提出四万六千五百四十亩玉米，保证超产一百四十三万斤；二千三百多亩水稻，每亩超产九十斤。当超产计划和增产措施落实到各生产小队之后，各小队都争先恐后地展开了超产竞赛。各队之间天天交流情报，夜夜公布战果，促进超产运动向高潮发展。
    在这次超产运动中，各级党委书记和干部都深入田间和群众同劳动。共产党员、共青团员在这次运动中，都发扬了党的光荣传统，哪里最艰苦，就到哪里去。因此，他们负责管理的都是条件不好、工作
  任务艰巨的三类秋田。例如华州公社椭坡管理区一、二类玉米都分配给群众管理，剩下一千零一十多亩三类玉米，人们认为条件差、不好管理，八百多党、团员自动把这些三类玉米管起来，并且提出不管有多少困难，一定要三类玉米升级。
    目前，虽然已是深秋，但是在渭南县的田野里，却出现了过去少见的景象：在棉田里，上面是一片红花，下边一片白絮，棉农们一面摘白花，一面加强管理，促使多结秋桃。农民们兴奋地说：“这才是丰收的景象哩！再加一把劲，争取超过超产计划，迎接国庆！”
