Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: The second session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which closed today, called on the people of the city to strive to build our great motherland's capital into a socialist city with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and technology, and culture.

Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and Mayor of Beijing, delivered an important speech at today's closing session.

The Second Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress began on the 10th. The representatives listened with great excitement to the work report made by Vice Mayor Wan Li on behalf of the Municipal People's Committee. All the representatives expressed great satisfaction with the current vigorous and magnificent Great Leap Forward situation and the brilliant achievements in construction in Beijing. They unanimously agreed that the work in Beijing over the past year has resolutely and comprehensively implemented the general line of the Communist Party of China for socialist construction. In group and plenary discussions, representatives from various fronts used many specific and vivid facts to praise the glorious victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and refuted the slanders and smears of hostile elements at home and abroad. The representatives expressed their warm response to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, and continued to leap forward with even greater strides on the basis of the great achievements already made. Cao Xianbo, chairman of the trade union of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, said that some people said that our large-scale iron and steel production "failed," but the facts prove that this is completely slanderous. The pig iron output of our Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company in 1958 increased eighteen-fold compared with 1949, and increased by 17% compared with 1957 without increasing equipment. In the Great Leap Forward last year, a converter workshop and a small rolling mill were built in a very short period of time. Immediately afterwards, the No. 3 Blast Furnace, No. 3 Coke Oven, and Sintering Plant were built in less than a year. These three major projects have been put into production this year. At present, the employees have launched a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. In early September, the average daily output of pig iron increased by 12.78% compared with August, steel increased by 20.05% compared with the average daily output in August, and steel products increased by 48.33%. All employees of the company are determined to respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session with greater leap forward achievements. Chen Shilin, chairman of the trade union of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, said that 1958 was an unprecedented year of the Great Leap Forward for the Jingxi Mining Bureau. The annual output of raw coal was 4.06 million tons, an increase of 71.24% compared with 1957, equivalent to more than half of the total actual coal output during the First Five-Year Plan, and equal to the total coal output in the twenty years before liberation. New victories have been achieved in production this year, with raw coal production from January to August increasing by 68.86% compared with the same period last year. He said that the employees of the entire mining bureau are now using the practical action of producing more and better coal to celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

Many representatives from the people's communes spoke freely about the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. Guo Rong, deputy director of the Changxindian People's Commune, said that the people's commune is a great good thing that the Party has led the peasants to do. Compared with 1957 before communization, the per-mu yield of grain in our commune increased by 27.6%, sideline production increased by 40%, and the average income per household increased by 34%. In addition, a large number of canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly were established, reservoirs and canals were built, and forty-two large and small factories were established. Ai Dehuai, deputy secretary of the Zhaizhai Township Party Committee of Mentougou, said that when it was just liberated, there was a shop in Malan Village, Mentougou District, with more than 200 households. The shop had ten kilograms of white sugar and a pack of Hengda brand cigarettes, which were not sold out for a whole year. By 1957, the number of people in the village had not increased much, but the village's supply and marketing cooperative sold more than 700 kilograms of white sugar in one year. After communization, several boxes of cigarettes were sold in one month. The representatives pointed out that in the face of these facts, the claim that the people's commune was "messed up" is simply a daydream.

Representatives from urban construction, culture, education, and health also used many specific facts to talk freely about the brilliant victories achieved on these fronts in implementing the Party's general line for building socialism.

In the resolution on the work report of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, which was finally adopted at the conference, the city's workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals and other patriotic people are called upon to warmly respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, and under the leadership of the Party, unite more closely, hold high the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and forge ahead bravely to build the capital of the great motherland into a socialist city with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and technology, and culture.

The conference also adopted the resolution on the final accounts of financial revenue and expenditure for 1958 and the budget report of financial revenue and expenditure for 1959, and the report of the proposal examination committee on the examination of proposals.

The first plenary session of the Second Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which began on the 10th, also closed today.

    北京三届二次人代会闭幕
    号召全市人民把首都建设成一个现代化城市
    新华社17日讯　今天闭幕的北京市第三届人民代表大会第二次会议，号召全市人民为把我们伟大祖国的首都建设成为一个具有现代化工业、现代化农业、现代化科学技术和文化的社会主义城市而奋斗。
    中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委第一书记、北京市市长彭真，在今天的闭幕会上作了重要发言。
    北京市第三届人民代表大会第二次会议是在10日开始举行的。代表们以无比兴奋的心情听取了副市长万里代表市人民委员会所作的工作报告，全体代表对当前北京市万马奔腾、雄伟壮阔的大跃进局面和光辉灿烂的建设成就表示十分满意；一致认为北京市一年来的工作是坚决地、全面地贯彻执行了中国共产党的社会主义建设总路线。在小组和大会的讨论中，来自各个战线上的代表以很多具体生动的事实，颂扬了总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉胜利，驳斥了国内外敌对分子的诽谤和诬蔑。代表们纷纷表示热烈响应中共八届八中全会的号召，在已经取得巨大成绩的基础上，继续用更大的步伐向前跃进。石景山钢铁公司工会主席曹宪波代表说，有人说我们大办钢铁“失败了”，事实证明这完全是诬蔑，我们石景山钢铁公司1958年生铁产量比1949年增长了十八倍，在设备没有增加的情况下比1957年增长了17％。去年大跃进中以极短的时间建成了转炉车间和小型轧钢车间，紧接着用不到一年的时间又建成了三高炉、三焦炉和烧结厂，这三大工程已于今年分别投入生产。目前职工们掀起了新的增产节约高潮。9月上旬生铁平均日产量比8月份提高12.78％，钢比8月份平均日产量提高20.05％，钢材提高48.33％，全公司职工决心用更大的跃进成绩响应八中全会的号召。京西矿务局工会主席陈士林代表说，1958年是京西矿务局史无前例大跃进的一年，全年生产原煤四百零六万吨，比1957年增长71.24％，相当于第一个五年计划实际产煤量总和的一半以上，等于解放前二十年产煤量的总和。今年的生产又获得了新的胜利，1至8月原煤生产比去年同期增加了68.86％。他说现在全矿务局的职工正在用多出好煤的实际行动来庆祝伟大的建国十周年。
    来自人民公社的很多代表，畅谈了人民公社的无比优越性。长辛店人民公社副主任郭荣代表说，人民公社是党领导农民办的一件天大的好事，和公社化以前的1957年比，我们公社的粮食亩产量增产27.6％，副业生产增加了40％，每户平均收入增加了34％。此外还办了大批食堂、托儿所、敬老院，修建了水库、水渠，办了四十二个大小工厂。门头沟斋堂乡党委副书记艾德怀说，刚解放时，有二百多户的门头沟区马兰村有一家商店，店里存有十斤白糖、一条恒大牌的纸烟，整整一年也没卖完。到1957年，村里人并未增加多少，但是这个村的供销社一年就卖出白糖七百多斤。公社化以后，一个月就卖出几箱纸烟。代表们指出，面对这些事实，所谓人民公社“搞糟了”的说法，岂非白日做梦。
    城市建设、文教卫生等方面的代表，也用很多具体事实，畅谈了在这些战线上贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线所取得的光辉胜利。
    大会在最后通过的北京市人民委员会工作报告的决议中，号召全市工人、农民、革命知识分子和其他爱国人民，热烈响应中共八届八中全会的号召，在党的领导下，更加紧密团结起来，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜奋勇前进，为把伟大祖国的首都建设成为一个具有现代化工业、现代化农业、现代化科学技术和文化的社会主义城市而奋斗。
    大会还通过了1958年财政收支决算和1959年财政收支预算报告的决议和提案审查委员会关于提案审查的报告。
    10日开始举行的政协北京市第二届委员会第一次全体会议也在今天闭幕。
