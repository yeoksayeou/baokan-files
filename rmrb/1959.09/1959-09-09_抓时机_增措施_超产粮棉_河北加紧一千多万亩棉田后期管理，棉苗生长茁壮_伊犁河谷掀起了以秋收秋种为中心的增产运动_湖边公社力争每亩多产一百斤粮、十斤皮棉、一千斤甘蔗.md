Seize the Opportunity, Increase Measures, Surpass Production of Grain and Cotton
    Hebei Intensifies Late-Stage Management of Over Ten Million Mu of Cotton Fields, Cotton Seedlings Grow Sturdily
    The Ili River Valley Launches a Production Increase Movement Centered on Autumn Harvest and Autumn Planting
    Hubian Commune Strives to Produce an Extra Hundred Jin of Grain, Ten Jin of Ginned Cotton, and a Thousand Jin of Sugar Cane Per Mu
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th: The over 14 million mu of cotton fields in Hebei Province are generally growing well. People's communes in cotton-producing areas are actively carrying out late-stage cotton management work, striving for a surplus in cotton production.

    After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, they powerfully encouraged the production enthusiasm of farmers in cotton-producing areas. They overcame complacency, formulated new management measures, and proposed new fighting slogans, creating a new atmosphere on the cotton production front. Farmers in Shulu County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, proposed the battle cry of "On the basis of the original plan of 85 jin of ginned cotton per mu, seize the opportunity, increase measures, and realize a county of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu." Donglizhuang Commune in this county classified and ranked the commune's 50,000 mu of cotton fields, deciding to push together and ridge the 30,000 mu of cotton fields with tall stalks and lush leaves, to remove basal leaves, shake the stalks after rain, and to pick off blighted flowers and shallowly irrigate to prevent bud and boll abscission and rotting; and to universally top-dress the over 10,000 mu of cotton fields with weak stalks, weak patches, and weak plots once. Fanjiazhuang Commune organized more than 10,000 commune members to prune the more than 30,000 mu of cotton fields once in three days, and top-dressed the 5,000 mu of weak cotton fields with a quick-acting fertilizer once. The Zhoujiazhuang Production Team of Dongzhuosu Commune started eight water-lifting machines and launched a sudden shallow irrigation, striving to grow two or three more autumn bolls per cotton plant and increase the production of 30 jin of seed cotton per mu. In order to eliminate weak cotton plants, the Xiquancheng Production Team of Dongchengquan Commune in Zhengding County top-dressed 92 mu of weak cotton plants with 10 to 15 jin of fine fertilizer; the Diaoqiao Production Team of Fengjiazhuang Commune mobilized more than 800 commune members to eliminate cotton bollworms one by one, stopping the development of the pest. Commune members of the Nandcao Management District of Dongwang Commune in Ningjin County pruned empty branches and finely pruned more than 300 mu of cotton fields, striving for each plant to set four or five more bolls.

    In order to ensure increased cotton production, commune members in various places also paid attention to meticulous harvesting. By August 31, Quzhou, Cixian, Neiqiu and other counties in Handan Prefecture had harvested more than 29.02 million jin of cotton. In general, they ensured that ripe cotton was not left on the plants during harvesting, preventing the cotton from mildewing after rain; that no cotton was left in the cotton bowls (shells of ripe cotton bolls), ensuring that the mature seed cotton was obtained; and that the harvested cotton was dried and properly stored to prevent the cotton from deteriorating.

    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 7th: More than 84,000 people of all ethnic groups in the nine people's communes of Yining County, residing on the banks of the Ili River in Xinjiang, are responding to the call of the Party with practical actions, launching a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on autumn harvest, autumn planting, and grain storage. In the past ten days, each commune has dispatched 1,500 horse-drawn plows every day, and more than a dozen tractors to rush-plant winter wheat, dispatching more than 3,000 large carts to rush-transport wheat bundles and send grain to storage. More than 10,000 male and female laborers formed a dryland harvesting commando, and went to the mountain slopes stretching for dozens of miles, building dugouts to set up camps and rush-harvesting 180,000 mu of dryland crops. As of September 5, more than 80,000 mu of winter wheat had been planted, all 19 million jin of public grain had been stored, and oil crops and spring wheat had also been harvested and transported away. The communes unanimously proposed that they would fight hard for 20 days to sow 420,000 mu of winter wheat, equivalent to the total area of winter and spring wheat harvested this year.

    Yining County is the main agricultural area of the Ili River Valley. After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were transmitted here, the people's communes convened Party representative conferences or three-level cadre meetings to mobilize all-out efforts to invest in autumn harvest, autumn planting, and grain storage. The attendance rate of more than 32,000 laborers in the county reached over 95%, and many production brigades reached 100%. The Hongxing, Shengli and other people's communes, which planted more dryland crops, sent two-thirds of their labor force to the mountain slopes without houses and trees to rush-harvest dryland crops. More than 300 temporary canteens were also set up on the mountains. In order to save time, many production teams organized manpower to harvest, thresh, and transport during the day, and winnow at night, with two sets of people and horses, changing people and horses without changing tools, and the labor efficiency was doubled. The Tianshan People's Commune concentrated all 360 large carts in the commune to pull and transport wheat bundles during the day and send public grain at night and early in the morning, sending 2.3 million jin of public grain in three days.

    The people's communes and production brigades also supported each other to solve the shortage of labor and livestock. The Yingya'er Brigade of the Hongqi People's Commune had a shortage of labor and carts. Under the unified leadership of the commune, the Bayandai Brigade drew more than 100 laborers to help them contract for harvesting 2,000 mu of crops, and the Sanduan Brigade sent 10 large carts to help them transport grain into storage. The Tianshan, Hongxing, and other five people's communes concentrated 1,000 strong laborers to support the Wuyi and Hongqi people's communes, which had more paddy fields, to ensure that the county's 60,000 mu of paddy fields were harvested within a week.

    This newspaper reports: After studying the Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, more than 24,000 commune members of the Hubian People's Commune in Gan County, Jiangxi Province, were all high-spirited and full of energy. They added targets and looked for measures, determined to work hard for 50 days, striving for the yield per mu of the 55,000 mu of grain crops and cash crops to increase by 100 jin of grain, 10 jin of ginned cotton, and 1,000 jin of sugar cane on the basis of the original plan, and resolutely turn the Party's great call to increase production and practice economy into reality.

    In order to achieve the goal of increasing production, at present, more than 24,000 commune members in the commune have invested in the battle against drought, eliminating insects, weeding, and fertilizing, setting off a wider and more in-depth production upsurge.

    The Panlong Brigade, threatened by drought, has had more than 90 commune members persisting in fighting the drought since the beginning of July. Recently, another 75 commune members were transferred to join the drought-fighting ranks, carrying buckets of water and manure ladles, while drawing water for irrigation and carrying water to water the land. From August 29 to 31, the team urgently irrigated more than 1,600 mu of crops fully once or twice. The Zhukeng Brigade, which has more insect pests, has further strengthened the work of insect prevention and elimination. In the past three days, the team has organized seven insect elimination commando teams to spray pesticides on 304 mu of late rice and 153 mu of cotton fields that have been found to have pests, and cleared away all the weeds around these fields, and also disinfected the fields and sprinkled lime, basically extinguishing the pests. In order to completely eliminate pests and prevent them from reoccurring, the team then established four insect pest forecast points, designating 17 experienced old commune members responsible for insect pest forecasting and regular pest elimination work. The late rice field management work of the Honghe Brigade was poor, and third-class seedlings accounted for 30%. After studying the Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Party Branch Secretary Huang Farong immediately led the team's 325 commune members to start work early and end work late, continuously attacking for four days, weeding the second time, and applying more than 6,800 loads of fertilizer, greatly changing the team's 343 mu of third-class seedlings.

    Now, the attendance rate of the entire commune has reached more than 99%. In the five days from August 28 to September 1, the entire commune has weeded the second time and applied the second fertilizer to more than 31,000 mu of late rice, and more than 14,000 mu of late rice has been weeded the third time and applied the third fertilizer, breaking the habit in the history of this commune of only weeding late rice twice and only applying fertilizer twice. More than 19,000 mu of rice and cotton fields in the commune where insect pests were found have basically extinguished the pests after the great rescue by the commune members.

    抓时机　增措施　超产粮棉
    河北加紧一千多万亩棉田后期管理，棉苗生长茁壮
    伊犁河谷掀起了以秋收秋种为中心的增产运动
    湖边公社力争每亩多产一百斤粮、十斤皮棉、一千斤甘蔗
    新华社天津8日电　河北省一千四百多万亩棉田普遍生长良好。产棉区各人民公社正在积极展开棉花后期管理工作，力争棉花超产。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，有力的鼓舞了产棉区农民的生产热情，他们克服自满情绪，纷纷制订了新的管理措施，提出了新的战斗口号，棉花生产战线气象焕然一新。石家庄专区束鹿县农民提出了“在原计划亩产八十五斤皮棉的基础上，抓时机，增措施，实现百斤皮棉县”的战斗口号。这个县的东里庄公社，把全社五万亩棉田分类排队，决定为株高叶茂的三万亩棉花推棵并垅，打棠叶，雨后摇棵，摘败花和小水浅浇，以防止蕾铃脱落和腐烂；为一万多亩有弱株、弱块、弱片的棉田普遍追肥一次。范家庄公社组织了一万多名社员，用了三天时间，为三万多亩棉花整枝一遍，为五千多亩弱棉田追了一次速效肥，东卓宿公社周家庄生产队开动八台提水机器，突击小水浅浇，力争每株棉花再长两三个秋桃，每亩再增产三十斤籽棉。正定县东城权公社西权城生产队为了消灭棉花弱棵，对九十二亩弱棉花追细肥十斤到十五斤；丰家庄公社刁桥生产队发动了八百多名社员除治棉铃虫，逐棵消灭，制止了虫害的发展。宁晋县东汪公社南丁曹管理区社员，为三百多亩棉田剪空杈，细整枝，争取每棵多座四、五个桃。
    为了保证棉花增产，各地社员还注意了精细收摘。邯郸专区曲周、磁县、内丘等县到8月31日止，已摘花二千九百零二万多斤。摘时普遍做到了棵上不丢已熟棉花，防止下雨后棉花发霉；棉碗（已熟棉桃的壳）里不剩零棉花，把长熟的籽棉保证拿到手；并把摘后的棉花随摘随晒、妥善收藏，防止棉花变质。
    新华社乌鲁木齐7日电　居住在新疆伊犁河岸的伊宁县九个人民公社的八万四千多各族社员，正以实际行动响应党的号召，掀起了以秋收秋种和粮食入仓为中心的增产节约运动新高潮。最近十天以来，各公社天天出动一千五百架马拉犁，十几台拖拉机抢种冬麦，出动三千多辆大车抢运麦捆和送粮入仓。一万多名男女劳动力组成旱田收割突击队，开上绵延数十里的山坡，搭地窝子安营扎寨，抢收十八万亩旱田作物。到9月5日止，已经压种冬麦八万多亩，一千九百万斤公粮已全部入仓，油料作物、春小麦也已经割完、运走。各公社一致提出，要苦战二十天，播种冬麦四十二万亩，等于今年收获的冬春小麦面积的总和。
    伊宁县是伊犁河谷的主要农业区。当党的八届八中全会公报和决议传到这里后，各人民公社就分别召开党代表大会或三级干部会议，动员全力投入秋收秋种和粮食入仓工作。全县三万二千多劳动力出勤率达到95％以上，许多生产大队达到了百分之百。播种旱田较多的红星、胜利等人民公社，有三分之二的劳动力开上了没有房子、没有树荫的山坡上，抢收旱田。在山上还临时成立三百多个食堂。为了抢时间，许多生产队都组织人力，白天收割打运，夜晚扬场，配备了两套人马，换人换马不换工具，劳动效率提高了一倍。天山人民公社集中全社三百六十多辆大车，白天拉运麦捆，夜晚和清早送公粮，三天就送了公粮二百三十万斤。
    各人民公社和各生产大队之间还互相支援，解决劳动力、畜力的不足。红旗人民公社英亚尔大队劳动力少，大车不够，在公社统一领导下，巴彦岱大队就抽了一百多名劳动力帮助他们包割两千亩庄稼，三段大队派出十辆大车帮助他们运粮入仓。天山、红星等五个人民公社集中了一千名精壮劳动力，支援水稻田较多的五一和红旗两个人民公社，保证全县六万亩水稻在一个星期内割完。
    本报讯　江西省赣县湖边人民公社二万四千多名社员学习了党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议以后，个个斗志昂扬，精神焕发，纷纷增指标、找措施，决心大干特干五十天，力争五万五千亩粮食作物和经济作物每亩产量在原计划的基础上多产一百斤粮食、十斤皮棉和一千斤甘蔗，坚决把党的增产节约的伟大号召变为现实。
    为了达到增产的目的，目前，全社二万四千多名社员纷纷投入了抗旱、灭虫、耘草、施肥的战斗，掀起了一个更广泛更深入的生产高潮。
    受干旱威胁的蟠龙大队，从7月初以来就有九十多个社员坚持抗旱，最近又抽调了七十五名社员挑着水桶粪瓢，加入抗旱行列，一边车水灌溉，一边挑水浇地，从8月29日起到31日止，全队急需灌溉的一千六百多亩农作物全部喝足了一次到二次水。害虫较多的珠坑大队，进一步加强了防虫灭虫工作，在最近三天中，全队共组织了七个灭虫突击小组，向已经发现虫害的三百零四亩晚稻和一百五十三亩棉花喷射了农药，并且把这些田地周围的杂草铲除的一干二净，还实行田间消毒撒上了石灰，基本上扑灭了害虫。为了彻底消灭害虫和预防害虫再度发生，全队接着建立了四个虫情预报点，指定十七个防虫灭虫有经验的老社员专门负责虫情预报和经常性的灭虫工作。红河大队晚稻田间管理工作做的较差，三类苗达30％，在学习了党的八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议以后，党支部书记黄发荣立即率领全队三百二十五名社员早出工、晚收工，连续突击四天，耘完了第二次草，追施了六千八百多担肥料，使得全队的三百四十三亩三类苗大大改观。
    现在，全社出勤率已经达到99％以上。在8月28日到9月1日的五天中，全社三万一千多亩晚稻已耘完第二次草，施完第二次肥，其中并有一万四千多亩晚稻耘了第三次草，施了第三次肥，打破了这一个社历史上晚稻只耘二次草只施二次肥的习惯。全社一万九千多亩发现害虫的稻田和棉田，经过社员们的大力抢救，已经基本扑灭了虫害。
