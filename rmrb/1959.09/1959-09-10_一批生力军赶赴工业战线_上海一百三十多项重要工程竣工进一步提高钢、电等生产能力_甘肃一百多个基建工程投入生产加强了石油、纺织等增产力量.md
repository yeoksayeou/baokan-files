Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 9th: Shanghai's capital construction continues to leap forward this year, with rapid progress in various projects.

From January to August, more than 130 important industrial projects were completed and put into production, including the No. 1 Steel Plant's first blast furnace with an annual output of more than 100,000 tons of pig iron and a steel ingot blooming mill, the No. 3 Steel Plant's thin plate workshop, the No. 5 Steel Plant's second electric furnace workshop and rolling mill, the hydraulic press workshops of the Pengpu Machine Factory and the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory, as well as a number of factories and workshops in the chemical, light textile, and power industries. After these projects are put into production, they will further improve Shanghai's production capacity of raw materials such as steel, steel products, electricity, and cement, and make the production equipment of some factories more balanced, so that production potential can be better utilized. For example, Shanghai's electromechanical industry used to lack large forging equipment, and the main shafts of products such as steam turbines, large motors, and diesel engines had to rely on forging from other places for production. After the hydraulic press workshops of Pengpu Machine Factory and Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory were put into production, some large steel parts could be forged locally in Shanghai. In the past, Shanghai's blooming capacity was insufficient, and many rolling equipment could not be fully utilized. After the blooming workshop of the No. 1 Steel Plant was put into production, the blooming capacity gradually approached the needs of section steel production. In addition to these 130 projects, a number of key projects such as power, coking, and casting in Shanghai are currently under construction.

In terms of urban construction, continuing to implement the policy of serving production and serving the working people, Shanghai has also built a large number of roads and bridges, and laid a large number of tap water pipes and sewers from January to August this year. The Hu-Min Road and Gonghe New Road connecting the urban area to the two industrial zones of Minhang and Pengpu have been completed and opened to traffic. In order to further improve the living conditions of the people, more than 280,000 square meters of workers' housing have been built in the past eight months; and more than 200,000 square meters of workers' housing are under construction and will soon be completed.

In terms of cultural and educational construction, the expansion projects of twelve universities and more than one hundred primary and secondary schools will also be mostly completed in the near future.

Shanghai's capital construction has accelerated step by step due to concentrating efforts, ensuring key projects, and constructing in batches. The amount of capital construction completed in the second quarter of this year increased by 35% compared with the first quarter, and it is estimated that the third quarter will increase more than the second quarter. During the construction process, efficiency has been greatly improved due to the implementation of a large number of rationalization proposals put forward by employees and the promotion of new tools. In terms of savings, the Shanghai Construction Engineering Bureau system alone has saved 900 tons of steel, more than 4,400 tons of cement, and a large number of materials such as wood by adopting technical measures such as substitute materials, centralized processing, and unified batching.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 9th: Gansu Province has completed more than 100 industrial capital construction projects this year and put them into production.

The newly put into production projects include the first phase of the Lanzhou Chemical Plant's fertilizer branch, the Lanzhou Refinery's eleven main workshops such as atmospheric and vacuum distillation, thermal cracking, catalytic cracking, and granular fractionation, the Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Plant's drilling rig drill bit workshop, heat treatment workshop, more than 100 new wells in the Yumen Oilfield, as well as a part of the expansion of the Lanzhou General Machinery Plant, the Lanzhou Cotton Textile Factory's fine spinning workshop and weaving workshop, and the expanded part of the Aganzhen Coal Mine.

Due to the comprehensive development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy by the employees during the construction process, not only was the construction progress fast and the project quality good, but also the project cost was reduced, saving the country a lot of construction materials. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of the year alone, 1,800 tons of steel, more than 10,000 tons of cement, and more than 5,700 cubic meters of wood were saved; the funds saved due to cost reduction amounted to more than 10 million yuan.

The batch of projects recently completed by the Lanzhou Refinery has done a great job in ensuring quality. Before the start of each project, the technicians and foremen would explain the quality requirements to the workers in detail according to the drawings. For key projects or places where quality accidents are likely to occur, the workers would discuss and formulate measures to ensure quality. They also implemented a quality inspection system combining worker self-inspection, mutual inspection by part-time inspectors, and comprehensive inspection by full-time inspectors; every ten days, leaders, workers, and technicians of the work area would also conduct a "three-way combination" quality inspection to find and solve problems in a timely manner. In addition, the three-level inspection system of the team, construction group, and work area was strengthened. The entire work area formed a situation where everyone was concerned about the quality of the project and responsible at all levels, thus ensuring that the quality of the completed projects all reached the first class.

The Lanzhou Chemical Plant is very prominent in accelerating the construction speed. They rationally arranged the construction forces to ensure that the main project was put into production one and a half years ahead of schedule. In the construction of auxiliary projects and ending projects, they also tried to speed up the project progress. Since most of these projects were carried out in workshops that had already been put into production, and there were many projects, if the arrangement was not good, production and capital construction would affect each other. They sorted out the numerous projects one by one and incorporated them into the plan, arranging the construction order according to the production requirements. Both parties A and B and the production workshop jointly organized a comprehensive operation command group to unify the command of construction and production. As a result, neither production was affected, nor the construction progress was accelerated.

    一批生力军赶赴工业战线
    上海一百三十多项重要工程竣工进一步提高钢、电等生产能力
    甘肃一百多个基建工程投入生产加强了石油、纺织等增产力量
    新华社上海9日电　上海市的基本建设今年继续跃进，各项工程进展迅速。
    1月到8月，工业方面有一百三十多项重要的工程竣工投入生产，其中有上钢一厂第一座年产十多万吨生铁的高炉和钢锭开坯车间，上钢三厂的薄板车间，上钢五厂的第二电炉车间和轧钢车间，彭浦机器厂和上海重型机器厂的水压机车间，以及一批化工、轻纺、电力工业的工厂和车间。这些工程投入生产后，进一步提高了上海的钢、钢材、电力、水泥等原料材料和动力的生产能力，使部分工厂的生产设备更加平衡，生产潜力能够更好地发挥出来。如上海机电工业过去缺乏大型的锻压设备，汽轮机、大型电动机和柴油机等产品的主轴都要依靠外地锻压才能生产。彭浦机器厂和上海重型机器厂的水压机车间投入生产后，某些大型钢件就可以在上海就地锻压。过去上海由于开坯能力不足，不少轧钢设备未能充分发挥作用，上钢一厂的开坯车间投入生产后，就使开坯能力逐步接近型钢生产的需要。在这一百三十多项工程之外，上海市还有一批电力、炼焦铸造等重点工程目前正在加紧施工。
    在城市建设方面，继续贯彻为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的方针，上海市今年1月到8月也修建了大批的道路桥梁，铺设了大量自来水管和下水道。市区通往闵行和彭浦两个工业区的沪闵路、共和新路目前都已建成并开始通车。为了进一步改善人民居住条件，八个月来共建成了二十八万多平方米的工人住宅；还有二十多万平方米工人住宅正在加紧施工，不久也可全部完成。
    在文教建设方面，十二所高等学校和一百多所中小学的扩建工程，也大部分将在最近期间陆续完工。
    上海市的基本建设由于集中力量，保证重点，分批建设，使建设速度步步加快。今年第二季度完成的基本建设工作量比第一季度增长35％，预计第三季度比二季度还要增长。施工中由于实现了职工提出的大批合理化建议，推行了新的工具，效率大大提高。在节约方面，仅上海市建筑工程局系统，由于采取代用材料、集中加工、统一配料等技术措施，就节约了钢材九百吨、水泥四千四百多吨，以及木材等大批材料。
    新华社兰州9日电　甘肃省今年已有一百多个工业基本建设工程项目竣工，投入生产。
    新投入生产的工程包括兰州化工厂肥料分厂一期工程，兰州炼油厂的常减压、热裂化、催化裂化、粒体精馏等十一个主要车间，兰州石油化工机器厂的钻机钻头车间、热处理车间，玉门油矿的一百多口新井，以及兰州通用机器厂扩建的一部分厂房，兰州棉纺厂的细纱车间和织布车间，阿干镇煤矿的扩建部分等。
    由于职工们在建设过程中全面开展增产节约运动，不仅保证建设进度快，工程质量好，而且降低了工程成本，为国家节约了许多建筑器材。据不完全统计，仅上半年就节约了钢材一千八百吨，水泥一万多吨，木材五千七百多立方米；由于降低成本而节约的资金达一千多万元。
    兰州炼油厂最近完工的一批工程，在保证质量方面做得很出色。在每一项工程开工之前，工地都由技术员和工长根据图纸详细地向工人交代质量要求，对重点工程或容易发生质量事故的地方，都由工人讨论和制订保证质量的措施。他们还实行工人自己检查、兼职检查员互相检查和专职检查员全面检查相结合的质量检查制度；工区领导干部、工人和技术人员每旬还要进行一次“三结合”质量大检查，发现问题及时解决。此外，还加强了队、施工组和工区三级检查制。整个工区形成对工程质量人人关心、层层负责的局面，因此保证了竣工工程质量全部达到头等。
    兰州化工厂在加快施工速度方面很突出。他们合理安排了施工力量，保证主要工程比原计划提前一年半投入生产，在辅助工程和结尾工程施工中，他们也尽量加速工程进度。由于这些工程大部分是在已经投入生产的车间里进行的，项目又多，安排不好，生产和基建就会互相影响。他们就把繁多的工程项目逐项排队编入计划，根据生产的要求安排施工次序。甲乙双方和生产车间又共同组织了综合作业指挥组，统一指挥施工和生产。结果，既未影响生产，又加快了施工进度。
