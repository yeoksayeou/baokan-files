    A Miracle Created in Ten Months
    ——Remembering the Birth of the Great Hall of the People
    By our correspondent Zhang Lijun
    The Great Hall of the People has been completed with extraordinary speed. This magnificent hall has a construction area of ​​more than 170,000 square meters, which is more than the total effective usable area of ​​the Forbidden City's architecture. However, it only took more than ten months from the start of design to its complete construction, and the construction time was only a little over ten months. This is a great miracle.
    Could it be completed in about a year? Initially, some people, after hearing the builders' affirmative answer, gasped or shook their heads repeatedly. However, under the illumination of the Party's General Line, 14,000 builders, and the people of the whole country who actively supported them, poured their efforts into it and built it with iron will for more than 300 days and nights. Now, on the eve of the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has been born. Representatives of all ethnic groups in the country will gather here to plan the major policies for the country's socialist construction, design blueprints for communist construction, and spread the strongest voice of peace to the world.
    Now, when people walk into this building, they will feel that the entire building is so harmonious, so rich and colorful, yet simple and solemn. This is a holistic building, and no single architect could design it alone. It concentrates the wisdom and efforts of thousands of people. From ordinary workers and college students to our national leaders, all participated and gave their opinions; design teams of thousands of people from Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Tianjin and other places, under the leadership of the Party, freely expressed their opinions and drew up plans. Finally, the strengths of hundreds of floor plans and elevations were combined to determine a plan.
    Like a military operation, the entire project had to resolve the battle in ten months; from the moment the first drawing was drawn, time was unchangeable. In any case, the buildings cannot spend National Day with scaffolding, time decides everything!
    The famous "Well-Shaped Beam Battle" on the construction site unfolded under these circumstances.
    When people see the rebar mesh of the well-shaped beam, they will surely think of the thermos shell woven from bamboo strips. The well-shaped beam is more than one person deep, 54 meters from north to south, and 48 meters from east to west. From the cross-section, there are 125 rebars as thick as eggs. The largest gap between the rebars is only eight centimeters, just enough to insert a vibrator rod; the smallest gap cannot even leak a stone larger than a bean. More than 1,000 cubic meters of concrete are required to be poured into one go through such a dense rebar. Because it bears the entire weight of the banquet hall, which is the size of a football field.
    In the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, concrete workers have built countless high-rise buildings, but when they stepped onto this well-shaped beam, they took a deep breath. How can concrete be rammed to the bottom at once with such a dense rebar mesh? Many workers and cadres did not dare to boast at first: "Absolutely guarantee quality."
    The construction site established a "Well-Shaped Beam Battle" command, headed by the Party Secretary of the sub-headquarters. The Party branch secretaries of each working section went deep into the construction site and held "pragmatic meetings" with technicians and outstanding shock troops. Everyone offered ideas and thought of solutions. Finally, a "V-shaped beveled pouring method" was developed, allowing concrete to enter the warehouse from both sides of the formwork through a "V-shaped" slope. In this way, layered pouring avoids the separation of concrete when it is poured from top to bottom. In order to ensure the accuracy of the sand and gravel mix ratio of the concrete, the workers weighed all the wooden trolleys used to hold the concrete before pouring. When weighing sand and gravel, people were as careful as when weighing flour, lest there be the slightest error.
    On the construction site, workers pushed trolleys full of concrete and ran back and forth happily on the scaffolding trestle, and the vibrator rods made a "bang, bang" sound. More than a thousand people fought on the well-shaped beam in an orderly manner. For thirty-three consecutive hours, many people's eyes were bloodshot, their clothes were soaked, and they did not go back to rest. Zhang Jinzhou, the fifty-year-old Party branch secretary, spent all day and night on the well-shaped beam, urging the workers to go back to rest one by one. The workers played hide-and-seek with him on the well-shaped beam; when urged too anxiously, people said, "Why don't you go back?"
    A few days after the concrete was poured, the builders came to remove the formwork with rapidly beating hearts. The curtain was unveiled, and the well-shaped beam answered them with its mirror-smooth concrete surface: no honeycomb pits, how beautiful!
    When the Well-Shaped Beam Battle was triumphantly concluded, a fierce battle unfolded next to the Great Auditorium.
    The steel structure of this part is rare in terms of its height and length. The twelve steel beams of the steel roof truss span more than sixty meters, and one end of six of them is pressed on the two large columns at the rostrum opening and the two horizontal beams spanning above them. The height of the columns is 45 meters. One horizontal beam is 4.5 meters high and the other is 9 meters high. Here, whether it was hoisting steel beams or pouring concrete, technical difficulties never encountered before were encountered. When the 60-meter-long steel beams were hoisted, a large number of experienced hoisting workers from Fulaerji, Taiyuan, Baotou and other places rushed to the scene. They fought side by side with the workers in Beijing to overcome the difficulties on the construction site. Hoisting steel beams is not a simple task. Steel beams that are seven meters high and wider than the current East Chang'an Avenue road surface became as soft as noodles and showed horizontal bending soon after they were lifted off the ground. Two trial hoists were unsuccessful. Difficulties cannot scare the heroic construction workers. After discussing with the experts, they decided to use steel supports to reinforce it and lift it up. As soon as the design and processing departments received the notice to make steel supports, they designed and processed them overnight; the transportation department immediately transported the newly made steel supports, which were still radiating heat, to the construction site. In two days and two nights, all the steel supports were installed, ensuring the success of the third trial hoisting.
    The tense battle was also taking place simultaneously in the triangular zone on both sides of the rostrum. Here, buildings equivalent to two dormitory buildings were to be built. In the construction industry, this building is called the "ear". It mainly houses control rooms for modern equipment such as broadcasting, television, simultaneous interpretation, and film shooting. Depending on the purpose, the shape and size of each building also vary. Some floors are not even as tall as a person, while some floors are equivalent to several floors of ordinary buildings. One floor slab also has four different thicknesses. The steel beams are curved and inclined, and most of the columns are inclined and rhombic. In the past, it took at least a month to tie one layer of rebar, pour one layer of concrete, lay one layer of flooring, and then lay one layer of floor slabs, but according to the project schedule, the construction period was at most only twenty-two days. What to do? The carpenters discussed it and a solution came out. They combined the experience of Beijing and Northeast China and other places and adopted the continuous formwork support method of supporting formwork from one to eight layers at a time. In this way, the carpenters can be completely unaffected by the rebar binding and concrete curing period. The rebar workers and concrete workers can also follow closely behind. After the carpenters support one floor slab, the rebar workers immediately intervene; after the rebar is tied, the concrete workers begin continuous pouring. The workers used their hands to catch up with the speed of prefabricated structures. In just over ten days, the structural engineering of two eight-story buildings was completed in one go.
    By May, the most complex steel beam hoisting task in the Great Auditorium was successfully completed. However, the entire project was just a frame of concrete wrapped in steel beams. The two-story balconies in the venue had not yet had steel beams hoisted; large and small battens and umbrella ribs had to be nailed on the top, and "sky and water in one color" ceilings had to be nailed on the skeleton; some underground projects had not yet been carried out. In addition to these structural projects, the entire Great Hall had to be plastered, painted, various lamps installed, and modern equipment such as cold and hot air and simultaneous interpretation installed. According to construction practice, decoration takes twice as long as structure. However, at this time, there were only more than three months left before the completion date. Whether these projects could be completed within such a short construction period became the key to whether the building could be completed before the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    The Party Committee handed over the problem to the masses for research: how can the complicated processes in the sky, underground, and around be carried out simultaneously in three-dimensional cross-operations?
    It is not difficult to erect scaffolding full of fir poles covering the entire floor. The difficulty is to make the fir poles not touch the ground and not affect the installation of ceilings, floors and chandeliers on the top and on the two-story balconies above and below.
    As a result, a dangerous scene like a acrobatic performance appeared. The scaffolders calculated the positions of the lamps like stars on the ceiling and cleverly inserted fir poles from the steel beams through the lamp rings without touching the ground. They then climbed down the poles like monkeys, hanging in the air more than 30 meters above the ground, tying horizontal "following water" fir poles. The fir poles were hoisted up from the ground and weighed about 100 kilograms. They caught the end of the pole and clamped it in their elbows to string it onto the frame, as freely as the Monkey King wielding his golden cudgel. After tying one pole, they used the safety rope tied to their waist to swing from one fir pole to another, like performing "aerial acrobatics." In less than two weeks, the ceiling of the entire hall and the upper and lower parts of the two-story balconies were full of suspended scaffolding, turning the entire space of the Great Hall into an eight-story operating platform with heaven above heaven and heaven and earth separated. Some were laying plastic panels on the ceiling and installing five-star sunflower chandeliers; above and below the balconies, there were those laying ceilings, laying floors, and plastering... Thousands of workers were operating on eight layers of "heaven and earth" at the same time.
    The general headquarters leading the entire project construction was like this: they divided the entire building into sections and assigned them to individual responsibility, and at the same time divided a ten-month battle into countless small battles, and concentrated superior forces to solve it according to the priority of different periods. After winning one battle, and then winning another battle, the building extended upward rapidly. By the end of August, when the scaffolding inside and outside disappeared together, this solemn and magnificent building immediately put on the most beautiful new clothes and appeared before our eyes.
    On average, there were 14,000 people building the Great Hall. They came from all over the country. There are advanced producers, model workers, and red flag bearers from construction sites all over the country; there are old workers who have done manual work all their lives, cadres of state organs, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, teachers and students of schools, and citizens; there are also women who have just left their families under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. It includes cadres and workers of various ethnic groups such as Han, Hui, Mongolian, Yi, Tibetan, and Uyghur. They only take eight hours of wages, but in order to complete a complex project, they sometimes work ten hours, twelve hours, or even twenty-four hours. Leading cadres persuaded them to rest, but no one listened. This situation really worried the leading cadres, but who can forbid others from loving their motherland and loving the cause of socialist construction? How touching the labor scene is! The cooks deliver hot meals to the scaffolding, and the medical staff also work on the construction site when they have free time. Labor is sacred and noble. Here, no one cares about the type of work and no one cares about the remuneration. Everyone's common goal is to build the Great Hall of the 600 million people more beautifully and to meet the wishes of the 600 million people.
    Now, after completing this glorious task, the builders have moved to other construction sites. A worker named Niu Zhenxiang wrote a farewell poem representing the mood of the majority of builders when he was about to leave this beloved building that he had built with his own hands:
    I stand in the center of the courtyard,
    Looking at this magnificent building once again,
    The more I look at it, the more lovable it becomes,
    The more I look at it, the more beautiful it appears.
    The car horn sounds again,
    Urging me to leave this place immediately.
    In order to throw myself into a new battle,
    Goodbye!
        Lovely Great Hall of the People. (Attached pictures)

    十个月创造的奇迹
    ——记人民大会堂的诞生
    本报记者　张丽君
    人民大会堂以非凡的速度建成了。这座宏伟壮观的大会堂，建筑面积达十七万多平方米，比故宫建筑有效使用面积的总和还多，但是，从开始设计到全部建成，仅仅用了十个多月的时间，而施工时间只有十个多月。这是一个伟大的奇迹。
    能在一年左右的时间内建成吗？起初，有些人在听到建设者们肯定的回答后，有的倒抽一口冷气，有的连连摇头。但是，在党的总路线的照耀下，一万四千名建设者，还有积极支援他们的全国人民，在这三百多个日日夜夜，用心血灌注它，用钢铁般的意志去建设它。现在，在伟大的建国十周年前夕，它诞生了。全国各族人民的代表将在这里聚会，策划国家社会主义建设的大政方针，设计共产主义建设的蓝图，把和平的最强音响遍全世界。
    现在，当人们一走进这个大厦，就会感到整个建筑是那么协调，那么丰富多彩，而又朴素庄严。这是一座浑然一体的建筑，没有一个建筑师能够单独把它设计出来。它集中了千千万万人的智慧和心血。从一个普通工人，一个大学生，到我们的国家领导人都参加了意见；北京的和来自上海、南京、武汉、广州、天津等地的上千人的设计队伍，在党的领导下，各抒己见，立案出图。最后，从成百张平面图和立面图中取长补短，确定了一个方案。
    像作战一样，整个工程十个月要解决战斗；从画出第一张图纸起，时间就是不可变更的。无论如何，不能让建筑物带着脚手架度过国庆节，决定一切的是时间！
    工地上著名的“井字梁战斗”，就在这种情况下展开了。
    人们看到井字梁的钢筋网，一定会联想到竹篾子编成的暖壶壳子。井字梁有一人多深，南北是五十四米，东西是四十八米，从断面上看，鸡蛋粗的钢筋有一百二十五根。钢筋之间最大的空隙只有八公分，刚够插进去一个震捣棒；最小的空隙连比豆子大一点的石子都漏不进去。一千多立方米的混凝土，要求通过这样密密麻麻的钢筋一气浇成。因为这里承受着比足球场面积还大的宴会厅的全部负重。
    建国十年来，混凝土工人不知盖了多少高楼大厦，可是走上这个井字梁一看，却倒吸了一口冷气。这样密的钢筋网，怎样能把混凝土一下扎到底呢？许多工人和干部一开始都不敢夸口：“绝对保证质量。”
    工地成立了以分指挥部党委书记为首的“井字梁战斗”指挥部。各工段的党支部书记，都深入工地和技术人员、优秀的突击队员一起开“务虚会”。大家出主意，想办法。最后研究出一种“八”字坡口浇灌法，让混凝土通过“八”字形的斜坡从模板两侧进入仓内。这样，分层浇筑，就避免了混凝土从上往下倒时发生的分离现象。为了使混凝土的砂石配合比准确无误，工人们在浇筑前把所有盛混凝土用的木制小车都过了磅。在称砂石料时，人们像称白面一样仔细，唯恐有丝毫的差错。
    工地上，工人们推着满载混凝土的斗车，在脚手架的马道上来往欢跑，震捣棒发出“突、突”的震响。一千多人在井字梁上战斗得有条不紊。一连三十三个小时，很多人的眼睛熬红了，衣服湿透了，也不回去休息。五十岁的党总支书记张金周整天整夜在井字梁上转，他挨个催工人回去休息，工人们就在井字梁上和他耍开了捉迷藏；催急了，人们就说：“你怎么也不回去？”
    打完混凝土的几天以后，建设者们怀着一颗急速跳动的心来拆模板。幕揭开了，井字梁以它镜子般光滑的混凝土面回答他们：没有蜂窝麻面，多么漂亮啊！
    在井字梁战斗高奏凯歌的时候，旁边的大礼堂部位又展开了激战。
    这个部位的钢结构，无论从它们的高度、长度来说，都是少见的。钢屋架的十二榀钢梁，跨度有六十米多，其中六榀的一端压在主席台口两根大柱子和横跨在上面的两榀横梁上。柱子的高度有四十五米高。横梁一榀有四点五米高，一榀有九米高。在这里，无论是吊装钢梁或浇筑混凝土，技术上都遇到了从未有过的困难。六十多米长的钢梁起吊时，富拉尔基、太原、包头等地大批富有经验的吊装工人赶来了。他们同北京的工人，在工地上肩并肩地向困难展开了斗争。吊钢梁可不是一件简单事，高度达七米、长度比现在的东长安街路面还要宽的钢梁，才吊离地面不久，却像面条一样软了，产生水平弯曲现象。两次试吊都没有成功。困难吓不倒英雄的建筑工人，他们同专家们研究后，决定用钢支架加固的办法把它吊上去。设计和加工部门一接到制做钢支架的通知，就连夜设计，连夜加工；运输部门把刚制作好还散发着热气的钢支架马上运到工地。两天两夜，钢支架就全部安装好了，保证了第三次试吊成功。
    紧张的战斗同时在主席台两侧的三角地带进行着。这里要兴建相当于两幢宿舍大楼的建筑物。建筑界把这项建筑叫做“耳光”。它主要是广播、电视、译意风和电影拍摄等现代化设备的操纵室。根据用途的不同，每间建筑物的形状和大小也各有差异。有的一层还没有一个人高，有的一层相当于普通楼房的好几层。一层楼板又有四种不同的厚度。钢梁是曲形和斜形的，柱子大部是斜形和菱形的。过去绑一层钢筋，浇筑一层混凝土，铺一层地板，再铺一层楼板，全部完成至少要一个月，可是按照工程进度，工期最多只有二十二天。怎么办呢？木工们一商量，办法就出来了。他们综合北京和东北等地的经验，采取了一层到八层模板一次支搭的连续支模法。这样，木工可以完全不受钢筋绑扎和混凝土养护期的影响。钢筋工和混凝土工也可以紧随其后，在木工支好一层楼板以后，钢筋工随即插手；钢筋绑好后，混凝土工就开始连续浇筑。工人们就用双手赶上了装配式结构的速度，只是十多天的时间，两幢八层的结构工程就一气呵成了。
    时间进入5月，大礼堂最复杂的钢梁吊装任务胜利完成了。但是，整个工程，还只是一个混凝土包着钢梁的筐架子。会场里的两层挑台还没有吊装钢梁；头顶上要钉大小龙骨和伞骨，骨架上要钉“水天一色”的天花板；地下有些工程还没有进行。除了这些结构工程外，整个大礼堂要抹灰，油漆，安装各色灯具，装置冷热风、译意风等现代化的设备。按照施工惯例，装修要比结构的时间多一倍。可是，这时离开竣工期只有三个多月了。能不能在这样短促的工期内完成这么些工程，成为这个建筑物能否在建国十周年前夕竣工的关键。
    党委把问题交给群众研究：怎么使天上、地下、四周，错综复杂的工序能够同时进行立体交叉作业？
    用几万根杉杆搭满堂落地脚手架并不困难。困难的是要让杉杆一根也不挨地，又不影响顶篷和两层挑台上下的天花板、地板和吊灯的安装。
    于是，一个像杂技表演一样的惊险场面出现了。架子工们计算了顶篷上像满天星斗的灯具的位置，巧妙地通过灯圈从钢梁上插下一根根不落地的杉杆。他们随即像猴儿爬杆一样从上顺杆而下，悬立在离地面三十多米的空中，绑扎横的“顺水”杉杆。杉杆是从地下吊上来的，有一百来斤重，他们接住杆头，就把它夹在肘中往架子上串，活像孙悟空舞动金箍棒一样自在。绑完一根以后，又像表演“空中飞人”一样，借助系在腰上的安全绳，从一根杉杆荡到另一根杉杆。不出两星期，整个大厅的顶篷、两层挑台上下，到处都是悬挂脚手架，把大礼堂的整个空间变成天上有天、天地隔绝的八层操作台。有的在铺设顶篷上的塑料板，安装五星葵花吊灯；挑台上下，有铺天花板的，有铺地板的，有抹灰的……。数以千计的工人同时在八层“天地”上操作。
    领导着整个工程建设的总指挥部就是这样：他们把整个大楼分片包干，同时把一个十个月的战斗分成无数次的小战斗，按不同时期的主次先后，集中优势兵力去解决它。打了一次胜仗，再打一次胜仗，建筑物飞速延伸上长。到8月底，当里里外外的脚手架一起消影匿迹的时候，这座庄严宏伟的建筑物，立即披上了最美丽的新装展现在我们眼前。
    建设大会堂的人们，平均每天有一万四千人。他们来自祖国的四面八方。这里有全国各工地的先进生产者，劳动模范，红旗手；有干了一辈子手工活的老工人，有国家机关干部，解放军官兵，学校师生和市民；也有才从1958年大跃进的形势下走出家庭的妇女。这里包括了汉、回、蒙古、彝、藏、维吾尔等各民族的干部和工人。他们只取八小时的工资，但是为了完成某项复杂的工程，有时干活十小时，十二小时，甚至二十四小时。领导干部劝他们休息，谁也不听。这种情形，真把领导干部急坏了，但是谁又能禁止别人对自己祖国的热爱，对于社会主义建设事业的热爱呢？劳动场面多动人呵！炊事员把热饭送到脚手架上，医务人员有空闲的时候，也在工地干起活来。劳动是神圣的，崇高的，在这里，没有人计较工种，没有人计较报酬。大家的一个共同目标，是把六亿人民的大会堂建设得更加美丽，符合六亿人民的愿望。
    现在，建设者们在完成了这个光荣任务以后，已经转移到另外一些建筑工地去了。一个名叫牛振祥的工人，在将离开他亲手建设的这个心爱的建筑物时，写了一首代表广大建设者心情的惜别诗：
    我站在庭院的中央，
    再一次把这雄伟的大厦看望，
    越看越觉得可爱，
    越看越显得漂亮。
    汽车喇叭又一次鸣响，
    催我即时离开这个地方。
    为了投入新的战斗，
    再见啦！
