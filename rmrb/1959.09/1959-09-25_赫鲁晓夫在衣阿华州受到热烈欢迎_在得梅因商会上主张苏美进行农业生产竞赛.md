Xinhua News Agency, Pittsburgh, September 24th: According to TASS, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev arrived in Pittsburgh from Des Moines on the evening of the 23rd with his entourage.

Welcoming the Soviet guests at the Pittsburgh airport were Pittsburgh Mayor Gallagher and other officials. In welcoming Khrushchev, the Mayor presented the keys to the city to Khrushchev.

Gallagher said, "I and all the citizens of this city sincerely hope that the purpose of the visit stated by President Eisenhower when he extended the invitation to you will be achieved."

"I particularly hope that what you hear and see here will help our two countries better understand each other and help establish world peace."

In his reply, Khrushchev expressed his great pleasure in visiting Pittsburgh. He said that during his visit to the United States, he had met and talked with many people who were eager to improve Soviet-American relations. Khrushchev believed that the citizens of Pittsburgh had the same desire. Khrushchev thanked Pittsburgh Mayor Gallagher for giving him the keys to the city. He said that he would use these keys to open not only the doors that the Mayor himself allowed him to open.

Khrushchev concluded by saying, thank you for your warm welcome. Wishing peace and happiness to the city of Pittsburgh and its citizens.

Khrushchev and his entourage traveled by car to the "Carlton House" Hotel. Television reporters from "Columbia Broadcasting System" asked Khrushchev to answer a few questions at the hotel entrance, where about five thousand citizens had gathered. Khrushchev gladly agreed. He expressed his belief that the mutual visits of Soviet and American leaders would improve relations between the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: According to TASS, Pittsburgh: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev left hospitable Iowa on the evening of the 23rd and flew to Pittsburgh, a major industrial center in the United States.

Seeing him off at the airport were the Governor of Iowa, the Chairman of the Des Moines Chamber of Commerce, other officials, and thousands of citizens.

Khrushchev and his entourage arrived in Pittsburgh that evening.

Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: According to TASS, Coon Rapids (Iowa), September 23rd: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev, who is visiting Iowa in the United States, visited the farm of Roswell Garst on the 23rd. Garst has visited the Soviet Union more than once and had invited Khrushchev to visit his farm and learn about his work.

Khrushchev received a warm welcome from the citizens of Iowa all the way from Des Moines.

Iowa is located in the so-called corn belt of the United States, and it is a major agricultural state in the United States. The soil here is fertile, the climate is mild, and the rainfall is abundant, making it possible to obtain bumper harvests of corn, sorghum, and other crops, and animal husbandry is also well developed. However, Iowa is currently experiencing serious economic difficulties.

On the way to Garst's farm, they passed through some small towns and farms. Residents of these places rushed to the roadside to warmly welcome Khrushchev. All schools stopped classes, and students and teachers lined the streets with welcome signs. Like a grand festival, some houses hung national flags.

In the small town of Perry, with only six thousand residents, about two thousand people came to the streets to see the Russian guest. The signs they held read: "Perry Welcomes Khrushchev."

While visiting the farm, Garst explained the farm's situation to the guests, demonstrated the process of storing corn for silage, and how to raise young animals.

Then, Khrushchev and his entourage visited the neighboring Thomas Farm, which is well-known for its experience in cultivating new breeds of livestock to enable young animals to grow rapidly. The farmer happily met the guests. One of his daughters immediately took a photo of Khrushchev with the entire Thomas family.

After visiting the farm, at Thomas's request, Khrushchev posed for a photo with the farmer's five-year-old granddaughter, Martha.

Khrushchev and his entourage had lunch at Garst's farm. Then, they drove to Ames, where Iowa State University is located.

A large group of young students from various schools gathered in this university town. At the entrance to the university town hung a large banner written in Russian: "Chairman Khrushchev, God bless you, thank you for your disarmament proposal." The signs held by the students read: "Let us build peace together." They greeted Khrushchev with cheers and applause. Before Khrushchev's arrival, the university's journal published a special issue. The editorial of the special issue wrote that the students of the university were happy about Khrushchev's visit. It wrote, "Mr. Khrushchev, your first visit to the United States gives us hope for peace."

Khrushchev was warmly welcomed by University President Hilton. After exchanging greetings, Khrushchev visited the Department of Home Economics, attended a class, and visited the department's laboratory.

After visiting the Department of Home Economics, Khrushchev walked out of the building accompanied by members of the Soviet delegation, at which time cheers and applause erupted again from the students who filled all the doorways of the Department of Home Economics and the entire building. Khrushchev stopped from time to time, smiling and waving cordially to the students, which constantly aroused successive rounds of enthusiastic applause and cheers from the students.

Khrushchev also visited the university's laboratory center, where research is being conducted on the most effective methods of fattening pigs.

Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: According to TASS: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev delivered a speech at the Des Moines Chamber of Commerce in Des Moines, the capital of Iowa, on the 22nd. Khrushchev said: We in the Soviet Union know very well that your state occupies an important position in world corn production, and you have made great achievements in developing animal husbandry. It seems that you will be interested to hear that one of our largest agricultural regions, the Krasnodar Krai, has put forward a task to compete with Iowa in the production of agricultural products.

Khrushchev said that the agriculture of the United States, especially your state, is of great interest to us, primarily because it is a highly mechanized economy.

In terms of mechanization and labor productivity, our agriculture is currently behind your country, but this is only a temporary phenomenon. The socialist agricultural system can overcome this backwardness in a short period of time and guarantee higher labor productivity than your country's farms. This system opens up infinitely broad space for the development of production, because it has no crises and no competition. We have no and cannot have any threat of a collective farm going bankrupt. We have both a high level of cultivation, skilled cadres, and a machine-building industry that can create the necessary machines for agriculture. We are working hard to achieve full mechanization of all agricultural production processes through the use of complete machines, to use labor more rationally, and to ensure that each worker's output is higher. We have outstanding agricultural machinery operators who have achieved higher labor productivity than the best farms in your country in planting corn, cotton, beets, and other crops.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union is currently making very good progress in agricultural development.

He said: Our agriculture has great potential and unlimited possibilities for further expanding planting, increasing grain yields per unit area, and developing animal husbandry.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union and the United States can learn many useful things from each other in agriculture. He said that some people oppose this contact, believing that conducting contact and improving economic relations between our two countries will promote the faster development of the Soviet economy and help the Soviet Union smoothly complete its plans. Some newspapers in your country have published articles attempting to portray our seven-year plan as some kind of "threat of a Soviet economic offensive." I ask, what is the threat of our desire to expand agricultural production, and to whom is it a threat? What's wrong with us wanting to compete with you in the production of corn, meat, and milk? It is unlikely that anyone would say that Soviets will become "aggressors" because they consume more milk, butter, and meat.

Yes, our people have put forward the slogan "catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of product output per capita." But can this be seen as some kind of threat to Americans? We would not consider the farmers of Iowa to be aggressors simply because they produce much more corn and meat than the Kuban collective farms currently produce. We are calling for competition with you in the production of meat, milk, consumer goods, machines, steel, coal, and oil in order to make people live better. Isn't this more beneficial than the race to stockpile hydrogen bombs and any kind of weapons? May there be more corn and meat, and no hydrogen bombs at all!

Khrushchev described the production targets for industrial and agricultural products stipulated in the Soviet seven-year plan, and said: The Soviets firmly believe that the tasks stipulated in the plan can not only be completed, but will also be overfulfilled.

Khrushchev said that we are visiting the United States at the invitation of President Eisenhower in order to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and to consolidate the cause of peace.

If we can improve relations between our two countries, arrange mutually beneficial trade, and further expand cultural, sports, and other ties, then we can make a significant contribution to easing international tensions, peaceful coexistence, and consolidating world peace. And this will also have a good impact on the lives of the people of our two countries and all mankind.

Khrushchev said: During our visit to the United States, we held many meaningful meetings and talks with people from all walks of life in the United States. These meetings and talks show that the American people do not want war, and they long for peace. We heard many enthusiastic words and many friendly wishes addressed to the Soviet people.

Khrushchev emphasized: The Soviet people have an unwavering determination to uphold the cause of peace, and to enhance and develop friendly relations and cooperation between our two countries and between all peoples. The Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward at the United Nations helps to achieve this goal. The Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany also helps to achieve this goal. We believe that these problems are not insoluble, naturally, it is necessary to have the desire to solve these problems. Where there is a will, there is a way. These problems will definitely be solved, because the people of all countries have a common goal - the most noble and important goal - to ensure peace. (Attached picture)

    赫鲁晓夫在衣阿华州受到热烈欢迎
    在得梅因商会上主张苏美进行农业生产竞赛
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社匹兹堡讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫23日晚上和他的随行人员从得梅因抵达匹兹堡。
    在匹兹堡机场欢迎苏联客人的有匹兹堡市长加拉格尔和其他官员。在欢迎赫鲁晓夫时，市长把城市的钥匙赠送给赫鲁晓夫。
    加拉格尔说，“我和本市全体市民都真诚地希望，艾森豪威尔总统向您发出邀请时所陈述的访问目的将能实现。”
      “我特别希望，您在这里听到的和看到的，多少会有助于我们两国更好地相互了解，有助于建立世界和平。”
    赫鲁晓夫在答词中表示非常高兴访问匹兹堡。他说，在访美期间，他曾经同许多人会晤和交谈，他们都渴望改善苏美关系。赫鲁晓夫相信匹兹堡市民也有同样的愿望。赫鲁晓夫对匹兹堡市长加拉格尔向他赠送城市钥匙表示感谢。他说，他用这些钥匙要开的不仅仅是市长本人允许他开的大门。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，感谢你们的热情欢迎。祝匹兹堡市和它的市民和平和幸福。
    赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员乘车前往“卡尔顿大厦”饭店。“哥伦比亚广播公司”电视记者在集聚了五千左右市民的饭店门口请赫鲁晓夫回答几个问题。赫鲁晓夫欣然表示同意。他表示相信苏美领导人互访将改善两国的关系。
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社匹兹堡讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫23日晚上离开了好客的衣阿华州，飞往美国大工业中心匹兹堡。
    到机场欢送的有衣阿华州州长、得梅因市商会主席和其他官方人士，还有成千上万的市民。
    赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员当天晚上抵达匹兹堡。
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社库恩拉皮兹（衣阿华州）23日讯：正在美国衣阿华州访问的苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫23日参观了鲁斯威尔·加斯特的农场。加斯特不止一次地到过苏联，并曾经邀请赫鲁晓夫访问他的农场和了解他的工作。
    赫鲁晓夫离开得梅因市时一路受到衣阿华州市民的热烈欢迎。
    衣阿华州位在美国的所谓玉蜀黍地带，它是美国主要的农业州。这里土地肥沃、气候温和、雨量丰富，因而有可能使玉蜀黍、高粱以及其他作物获得丰收，畜牧业也很发达。但是，衣阿华州现在正遭到严重的经济困难。
   在前往加斯特农场的道路上经过了一些不大的市镇和一座座的农场。这些地方的居民奔向道路旁热烈地欢迎赫鲁晓夫。各学校都停止了上课，学生和教员们一起拿着欢迎的标语牌夹道欢迎。像盛大的节日一样，一些房屋悬挂了国旗。
    在一个只有六千居民的培利小镇，约有二千人来到了街上，要看看俄国贵宾。他们举着的标语牌写道：“培利欢迎赫鲁晓夫”。
    在参观农场的时候，加斯特向贵宾们说明了农场的情况，表演了作青贮料用的玉蜀黍的堆放过程和饲养幼畜的方法。
    然后，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员访问了邻近的托马斯农场，这个农场很有名，在培养新种牲畜使幼畜迅速成长方面颇富经验。农场主高兴地会见了贵宾。他的一个女儿立刻拍照了一张赫鲁晓夫同托马斯全家的合影。
    参观农场以后，赫鲁晓夫应托马斯的请求同农场主五岁的孙女——玛达合影留念。
    赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员在加斯特农场进了午餐。然后，驱车前往阿密斯城，在那里设有衣阿华州州立大学。
    在这个大学城里聚集了一大群从各个学校跑来的青年学生。在大学城的入口处悬挂着一幅用俄文写的大标语：“赫鲁晓夫主席，上帝保佑您，感谢您的裁军建议”。学生们拿着的标语写道：“让我们共同建立和平”。他们用一片欢呼声和掌声迎接赫鲁晓夫。在赫鲁晓夫到来之前，这个大学的学报出了专刊。专刊的社论写道，大学的学生为赫鲁晓夫的访问感到高兴。它写道，“赫鲁晓夫先生，您第一次到美国的访问给了我们对和平的希望”。
    赫鲁晓夫受到大学校长希耳顿热烈的欢迎。在互相致了祝贺词之后，赫鲁晓夫参观了家政系，在一个班上听了课，并参观了这个系的实验室。
    参观家政系以后，赫鲁晓夫在苏联代表团团员的陪同下从大楼里走出来，这时在挤满家政系所有门道和整个楼房的学生中又响起了欢呼声和鼓掌声。赫鲁晓夫不时地站住，微笑着，亲切地向学生们招手，以致不断引起学生们接二连三的热烈掌声和欢呼声。
    赫鲁晓夫还参观了大学实验室的中心，这里进行着研究喂肥猪的最有效的方法的工作。
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫22日在美国衣阿华州首府得梅因市商会发表了演说。赫鲁晓夫说：我们在苏联非常清楚地知道，贵州在世界玉蜀黍生产方面占有重要地位，你们在发展畜牧业方面有着巨大的成就。看来，你们听到这样的消息不会不感兴趣，即我国的一个最大的农业地区克拉斯诺夫边疆区提出了一个任务，要在农产品生产方面同衣阿华州竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国、特别是贵州的农业，使我们感到很大的兴趣，这首先因为它是高度机械化的经济。
    在机械化和劳动生产率方面，我国的农业目前比贵国落后，但这只是暂时的现象。社会主义农业体系可以在短期内克服这种落后现象，并保证有比贵国农场更高的劳动生产率。这种体系为发展生产打开无限广阔的天地，因为它没有危机，也没有竞争。我国没有也不可能有使某个集体农庄破产的任何威胁。我国既有高度的耕作水平，也有熟练的干部，还有能为农业创造必要机器的机器制造工业。我们正在努力通过采用完备的机器实现所有农业生产过程的全盘机械化，更合理地使用劳动力，保证每个劳动者的生产量更高。我们有杰出的农业机器手，他们在种植玉蜀黍、棉花、甜菜等作物方面达到了比贵国最好的农场更高的劳动生产率。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在农业发展方面，苏联目前正在非常顺利地前进。
    他说：我国农业有很大潜力和无限可能性来进一步扩大播种，提高谷物的单位面积产量和发展畜牧业。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏、美两国在农业上可以互相学到许多有益的东西。他说，有人反对这种接触，他们认为，进行接触、改善我们两国之间的经济关系会促进苏联经济更快的发展，帮助苏联顺利地完成自己的计划。贵国一些报纸发表了文章，企图把我们的七年计划说成是某种“苏联经济攻势的威胁”。试问，我们扩大农业生产规模的愿望是什么威胁，是对谁的威胁？我们想在玉蜀黍、肉类和奶类的生产方面同你们竞赛有什么不好呢？未必会有人说，由于更多地消费奶类、黄油、肉类，苏联人会成为“侵略者”。
    是的，我国人民提出了“在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过美国”的口号。但难道可以把这看作是对美国人的某种威胁吗？我们根本不会由于衣阿华州的农场主生产的玉蜀黍和肉类比库班集体农场现在生产的要多得多就认为这些农场主是侵略者。我们号召同你们在肉类、奶类、消费品、机器、钢、煤、石油的生产方面进行竞赛是要使人们生活得更好。这比储备氢弹和任何一种武器的竞赛岂不有益得多。但愿有更多的玉蜀黍和肉类，完全不要氢弹！
    赫鲁晓夫叙述了苏联七年计划规定的工农业产品的产量指标，并且说：苏联人坚信，计划规定的这些任务不仅能够完成，而且将超额完成。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们应艾森豪威尔总统的邀请访问美国是为了改善苏美两国的关系和巩固和平事业。
    如果能够改善我们两国的关系，安排互利的贸易，进一步扩大文化、体育等联系，那么我们就能够在缓和国际紧张局势、和平共处和巩固世界和平方面作出重大的贡献。而这也会对我们两国人民和全人类的生活发生良好的影响。
    赫鲁晓夫说：在我们访问美国期间，我们同美国人民的各阶层人士举行了多次有意义的会晤和会谈。这些会晤和会谈表明美国人民不要战争，他们渴望和平。我们听到了对苏联人民说的许多热情的话，许多友好的祝愿。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说：苏联人民具有不可动摇的决心来维护和平事业，增进和发展我们两国之间和各国人民之间的友好关系和合作。苏联政府在联合国提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议有助于达到这一目标。苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议也有助于达到这一目标。我们认为，这些问题不是不可解决的，自然，必须要具有解决这些问题的愿望。哪里有愿望，那里就有途径。这些问题一定会得到解决，因为各国人民具有一致的目的——最崇高和最重要的目的——保障和平。（附图片）
