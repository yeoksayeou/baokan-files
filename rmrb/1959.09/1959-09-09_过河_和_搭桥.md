“Crossing the River” and “Building Bridges”
Jin Wen

To do all work well, we must pay attention to working methods. Chairman Mao said twenty-five years ago in "Pay Attention to the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods": "We must not only put forward tasks, but also solve the problem of methods for completing tasks. Our task is to cross the river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. Without solving the problem of the bridge or boat, crossing the river is just empty talk. Without solving the problem of methods, the task is just pointless chatter.” The profound truth contained in these vivid metaphors has not only been proven by the practice of many years of revolutionary war, but it is still so relevant when read today as we carry out socialist construction.

In factories and enterprises, workshops and groups are grassroots organizations and the cells of the factory. The Party's policies are specifically implemented through workshop directors and group leaders. All production and work tasks of the factory must be realized through them. They are in contact with the masses every day and every hour. Therefore, how to help grassroots cadres solve the problem of "building bridges" becomes a crucial key to "crossing the river."

There is no secret to learning how to "build bridges." As long as you can help grassroots cadres take the mass line well, all difficulties can be solved easily. Isn't the example of Tianjin Steel Rolling Plant a good proof? Comrade Wang Changyou, the workshop director of the structural steel workshop in this factory, believes in the masses and brings into play their enthusiasm and creativity. He was originally unable to make worm wheels, but based on the urgent objective needs and actual possibilities, he mobilized the masses to find solutions, and as a result, used a lathe to replace a milling machine to make worm wheels. This allowed the working method and the working task to be solved simultaneously.

Of course, it is not enough to just recognize the importance of taking the mass line. After all, there is still the question of how to take the mass line. Judging from the situation in Tianjin Steel Rolling Plant and many other factories and enterprises, the most important thing is to consult with the masses when something happens. One person's opinion is ultimately very limited. "Many heads are better than one" and "the masses are sages." As long as everyone consults more, collective wisdom can be concentrated, and difficulties can always be solved. In concentrating the opinions of the masses, it is important to pay attention to listening to opinions from all sides. The opinions of the majority should of course be respected, and the opinions of the minority should not be ignored; agreeing opinions are worth noting, and disagreeing opinions should also be carefully considered. Comrade Wang Changyou of Tianjin Steel Rolling Plant adopted this working method. Comrade Wang Changyou wanted to know how many screws a team could turn. The first person said they could turn two or three, the second said they could turn three or four, and the third said they could turn five or six. He brought the three people together to exchange operating methods, and relied on the wisdom of the masses to solve the problem.

Another important issue for grassroots cadres to take the mass line well is to pay attention to grasping positive factors. Workshop directors and group leaders should be good at summarizing advanced experiences and promote the advanced to become even more advanced, and the backward to catch up with the advanced. In workshop meetings, group meetings, and pre-shift and post-shift meetings, we must focus on grasping positive factors. When summarizing work, we must greatly encourage the enthusiasm of the workers and masses, and talk more about advantages and advanced experiences; for shortcomings, we must take positive measures to overcome them. This method is a very good way to promote everyone's continuous progress and should be greatly promoted. At present, the working methods of some group leaders and workshop directors are relatively simple, with more criticism and less encouragement for workers, which affects the enthusiasm of the masses, and this is very worthy of attention. In grasping positive factors, we should also pay attention to the attitude towards the masses in backward states. In any work, there will be people in advanced, intermediate, and backward states, and this is not surprising. For those in intermediate and especially backward states, we must patiently do political and ideological work, enlighten their consciousness, and encourage them to take active action.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has issued a battle call to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year. In order to complete this glorious task, we need to properly solve the problem of "building bridges." If every grassroots cadre is good at taking the mass line, and if the "building bridges" problem for all work tasks can be well solved, then we can better inspire the enthusiasm of the masses, and we will smoothly "cross the river" and reach the shore of victory.

    “过河”和“搭桥”
    津文
    要做好一切工作，必须注意工作方法。毛主席在二十五年前在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中就说过：“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”这些生动形象的比喻所包含的深刻的真理，不仅为多年的革命战争的实践所证明，而且在进行社会主义建设的今天读起来，仍然是那么亲切。
    在工厂企业当中，工段、小组是基层的组织，是工厂的细胞。党的政策通过工段长、小组长具体执行。工厂的一切生产、工作任务，要通过他们来实现。他们每日每时都接触群众。因此，如何帮助基层干部解决“搭桥”的问题，就成为“过河”的重要关键。
    所谓学会“搭桥”，并没有什么秘诀，只要能帮助基层干部走好群众路线，一切困难都可迎刃而解。天津轧钢一厂的例子，难道不是一个很好的证明吗？这个厂型钢工段的工段长王长友同志相信群众，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，本来自己不能制作蜗母轮，但根据客观的迫切需要和实际可能，经过发动群众想办法，结果用旋床代替铣床制出了蜗母轮。这样就使得工作方法和工作任务同时解决了。
    当然，只是认识到走群众路线的重要性还不行，这里毕竟还有怎样走群众路线的问题。从天津轧钢一厂和许多工厂企业的情况来看，最重要的一条叫作有事和群众商量。一个人的看法究竟有很大的局限性，“人多主意多”“众人是圣人”，只要大家多商量，就可以集中集体智慧，困难总可解决。在集中群众意见当中，要紧的是注意倾听多方面的意见。多数人的意见当然应该尊重，少数人的意见也不可忽视；同意的意见值得注意，不同意的意见也应当郑重考虑。天津轧钢一厂王长友同志正是采取了这种工作方法，王长友同志要想知道一个班能旋多少个螺丝，问第一个人说是能旋两三个，第二个说能旋三四个，第三个则说能旋五六个。他把三个人都找到一起交换了操作方法，依靠群众的智慧解决了问题。
    基层干部走好群众路线的另一个重要问题叫作注意抓积极因素。工段长、小组长，要善于总结先进经验，推动先进的更先进，落后的赶先进。在工段会议、小组会、班前班后会上，要大抓积极因素。总结工作时，要大鼓工人群众的干劲，多讲优点、先进经验；对于缺点，要采取积极办法克服它。这种方法，正是推动大家不断前进的一种很好的方法，应该大大提倡。目前，有个别组长、工段长的工作方法比较简单，对工人批评多，鼓励少；影响了群众的积极性，这一点很值得注意。在抓积极因素中，还应当注意对落后状态的群众的态度问题。任何工作中，都会出现先进、中间、落后状态的人，这原因是不足为奇的。对处于中间状态特别是落后状态的人，要耐心地作政治思想工作，启发他们的自觉，鼓励他们积极行动起来。
    党的八届八中全会已经发出了战斗号召，要在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。为了完成这个光荣的任务，这就需要我们妥善地解决“搭桥”的问题。如果每个基层干部都善于走群众路线，如果一切工作任务的“搭桥”问题都能很好地解决，那就可以更好地鼓舞群众的干劲，我们就会顺利地“过河”，到达胜利的彼岸。
