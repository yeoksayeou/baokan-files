Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, September 14th: Encouraged by the Party's call, tens of thousands of forestry workers of various ethnic groups fighting in the Great Khingan Range of Inner Mongolia have launched a vigorous new upsurge of the production increase and economy campaign. As of September 9th, they had produced more than 385,600 cubic meters of timber, completing the third quarter timber production plan 21 days ahead of schedule and exceeding it by 0.15%.

The third quarter is a period of continuous rain, muddy roads, and biting gadflies, which affects the improvement of timber production efficiency. It is also a tense period for forest regeneration and capital construction. Under the call of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers criticized the right-leaning emotions existing in a few people, further boosted their energy, and all forest farms and work sections of the Ke Yihe Forestry Bureau held mobilization rallies. Workers competed with each other and launched a great competition to catch up with each other. Leading cadres of the Forestry Bureau and forest farms organized four production increase and economy inspection teams to the front lines to direct the battle and study and solve problems in production together with the workers. As a result, the plan was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded in August. From August 31st to September 5th, two production peaks were organized, concentrating the wisdom of the workers and the great strength of ingenuity and hard work, increasing the daily output by 42.9% to more than one time compared to the plan.

In the vigorous production increase and economy campaign, workers also carried out technical innovations on a large scale. On the condition that Luchong and some vehicles were being repaired, they continued to adhere to the train-type timber transportation method promoted during the Great Leap Forward last year. Wang Shoutong and Zhang Xiushan, workers of the Tuli River Forestry Bureau, jointly created a rolling loading tool, which not only freed the loading workers from shoulder-carrying labor, but also shortened the loading time by about 30%, greatly reducing the contradiction between mechanized timber transportation and non-mechanized loading. This new tool has been widely promoted throughout the forest area since the beginning of August. In addition, the May 1st type bent handle saw has been promoted in felling, which has increased felling efficiency by about one-third.

Now, not only has timber harvesting achieved great results, but the Yituli River, Ke Yihe, and Yuanlin Forestry Bureaus have also launched a mass afforestation campaign peak, and have all completed the annual afforestation renewal operation plan ahead of schedule recently. The Xiniqi Forestry Bureau has comprehensively overfulfilled the annual timber production, forest renewal operation, and timber sales plan five months ahead of schedule in the third quarter. At present, all employees are advancing victoriously towards the leap forward goal of increasing timber production by 450,000 cubic meters for the whole year. The level of daily output is steadily increasing, and the average daily output in early September increased by 15% compared with the average daily output in August.

    大兴安岭林业职工向国庆献礼
    提前超额完成三季度生产
    新华社牙克石14日电　战斗在内蒙古大兴安岭上的数万名各族林业职工，在党的号召鼓舞下，掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动新高潮，到9月9日止，已生产出三十八万五千六百多立方米木材，提前二十一天并超额0.15％完成了第三季度木材生产计划。
    第三季度正是阴雨连绵、道路泥泞、蛟虻叮咬，影响木材生产效率提高的时期。又是森林更新、基本建设的紧张时期。在党的八届八中全会决议的号召下，职工们批判了少数人存在的右倾情绪，进一步鼓足了干劲，克一河林业局各林场、工段都召开誓师大会，职工们纷纷打擂比武，展开了你追我赶的大竞赛。林业局和林场的领导干部组织四个增产节约检查团，到前线一面指挥战斗，一面同工人一道研究解决生产中的问题。结果，8月份提前超额完成了计划。8月31日到9月5日又组织了两次生产高峰，集中了职工们的智慧和巧干苦干的巨大力量，把日产量比计划提高42.9％到一倍以上。
    在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，职工们还大搞技术革新。在路冲和一部分车辆进行检修的条件下，继续坚持推行了去年大跃进中推广的列车式运材法。图里河林业局工人王守通和张秀山共同创造了滚动式装车工具，既使装车工人摆脱了肩扛劳动，又缩短了装车时间30％左右，大大减少了机械化运材与非机械化装车之间的矛盾。这一新工具在8月初已向全林区普遍推广。此外，在采伐方面还推广了五一型弯把子锯，提高采伐效率三分之一左右。
    现在，不仅木材采伐已经取得了巨大成绩，伊图里河、克一河和原林等林业局还大搞群众性营林运动高峰，都在最近提前完成了全年营林更新作业计划。西尼气林业局已在第三季度提前五个月全面地超额完成了全年木材生产、森林更新作业和木材销售计划。目前全体职工正为达到全年增产四十五万立方米木材的跃进目标而乘胜前进。日产量水平蒸蒸日上，九月上旬平均日产量比8月份平均日产量提高了15％。
