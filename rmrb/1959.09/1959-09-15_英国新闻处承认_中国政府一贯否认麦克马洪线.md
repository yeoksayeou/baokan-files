Xinhua News Agency, London, September 13th: The official British Information Services, in a document defending the McMahon Line on the 11th, had to admit that "the Chinese government has consistently denied the legitimacy of the McMahon Line."

This British official news organization said that Britain wanted to seek an "agreement that would make Tibet virtually independent" at the Simla Conference of 1913-1914, and that the McMahon Line was "marked on a map attached to this treaty." It said, "However, the Chinese government later refused to ratify this treaty," and "the Chinese government has consistently denied the legitimacy of the McMahon Line."

Although the British Information Services tried its best to explain that these were "binding" on the Tibetan local authorities in the same way as on the British government, it also had to admit that "in practice, Tibetans also tend to cross this (McMahon) line."

The British Information Services said that the Indian government "inherited" this so-called McMahon Line, "which was not actually marked on the ground," from the British government.

The "Times" published a letter from Bailey in its reader's letters column on the 7th, in which he admitted that the so-called McMahon Line illegally "ceded" the territory traditionally under the jurisdiction of the local government of Tibet, China, to India.

In his letter, Bailey said that in 1913, he and the late Colonel Morshead (of the British Royal Engineers and the Survey of India) "traveled" from east to west in the mountainous area of the eastern Himalayas. Bailey pointed out that at that time, the jurisdiction of the Tibetan local government extended to the area "south of the snow-capped line" of the Himalayas. When they arrived at Tawang at that time, they "found that the jurisdiction was purely in the hands of Tibetans."

Bailey wrote that the result of the negotiations between the British representative McMahon in 1913-1914 was to "cede a lower-lying part of Tibet, including Tawang, to India," which was then "called the McMahon Line." "But the Chinese government refused to ratify this agreement."

### 英国新闻处承认  中国政府一贯否认麦克马洪线

    英国新闻处承认
    中国政府一贯否认麦克马洪线
    新华社13日讯　伦敦消息：英国官方的英国新闻处11日在一篇为麦克马洪线辩护的资料里，不得不承认，“中国政府一贯否认麦克马洪线的合法性”。
    这个英国官方的新闻机构说，英国在1913到1914年的西姆拉会议上是想谋求一项“能使西藏在事实上独立的协定”，而把麦克马洪线“标在这个条约所附的一幅地图上”。它说，“但是后来中国政府拒绝批准这项条约”，“中国政府一贯否认麦克马洪线的合法性”。
    虽然英国新闻处竭力企图说明这些对西藏地方当局同英国政府一样是“有约束力”的，但是它又不得不承认，“实际上西藏人也倾向于越过这条（麦克马洪）线”。
    英国新闻处说，印度政府从英国政府那里“继承”了这条“并没有实际在地上标明”的所谓麦克马洪线。
    “泰晤士报”7日在读者来信栏中刊载了贝利的一封来信，其中承认所谓麦克马洪线把中国西藏地方当局传统管辖的领土非法“割让”给印度。
    贝利在信中说，1913年他和已故的莫斯赫德上校（属英国的皇家工程和印度测量局）自东至西“游历”了喜马拉雅山东段的山区。贝利指出，当时西藏地方政府的管辖权是到喜马拉雅山的“雪峰线以南”的地区的。当时他们到达塔湾时，“发现那里纯粹是西藏人掌握着管辖权”。
    贝利写道，英国代表麦克马洪在1913到1914年谈判的结果把“包括塔湾在内的西藏地势较低的一部分割让给印度”，这便“被称为麦克马洪线”。“但是中国政府拒绝批准这项协定”。
