Sweet Potato Yield Potential is High, Strengthen Late-Stage Management
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

Judging from the current crop growth, mid-season rice and early autumn coarse grains are about to mature. Generally speaking, only protection needs to be taken into account, and additional fertilization is not urgently needed. Sweet potatoes, late rice, and late autumn crops are still developing and growing, and additional fertilization can greatly increase yields. Therefore, putting more manpower and material resources into these crops and strengthening field management is of great significance for completing the annual grain production plan.

Among the autumn harvest crops, the one with the latest harvest period and the greatest yield potential is undoubtedly the sweet potato. From the perspective of the biological characteristics of sweet potatoes, they differ from general cereal crops in that they are not limited by the number of panicles and grains formed early. As long as the temperature is sufficient and the water and fertilizer conditions are good, the tubers can continue to expand until harvest time. Currently, spring sweet potatoes still have more than a month before harvest, summer sweet potatoes will be harvested even later, and autumn sweet potatoes in the south still have more than two months of growing season. This period is precisely when the above-ground and underground parts of sweet potatoes are growing rapidly, when the need for fertilizer and water is most urgent, and it is also the most important stage of field management.

Some cadres believe that sweet potatoes are coarse grains and easily rot, so they have given up leadership over sweet potato production and do not pay attention to strengthening sweet potato field management. This view and practice are wrong. Life experience tells us that sweet potatoes are not only eaten and used in many ways, but also have high yields and are the "half-year grain" for many rural areas. In areas where sweet potatoes are planted in large quantities, whoever does not pay attention to sweet potato production will inevitably become detached from the masses.

Some people think that sweet potatoes are "lazy crops," that they can be harvested even without fertilizer, water, or management. It is true that sweet potatoes are highly adaptable crops with relatively stable yields; however, it cannot be ignored that they are crops with great yield potential. If managed well, especially during the key stages of growth, and if important yield-increasing measures are conscientiously implemented, yields can often be doubled. Since strengthening subjective efforts can result in higher yields, why not do it?

Still others believe that sweet potatoes certainly have great yield potential, but the level of yield mainly depends on how well the foundation is laid, such as abundant base fertilizer, deep tillage, and appropriate dense planting, all of which are determined during the planting period; once planted, the overall situation is set, and whether or not to manage them makes little difference. This idea is also very harmful. Of course, good planting is very important; however, laying a good foundation does not mean that everything is fine. We know that the formation and expansion of tubers is the result of the above-ground stems and leaves carrying out photosynthesis, producing nutrients, and transporting them to the roots. Only with vigorous stems and leaves can sweet potatoes produce high yields. Everyone knows that the growth of the above-ground parts is closely related to field management; topdressing and watering, intertillage and weeding can transform third-class seedlings into first-class seedlings, and greatly accelerate the growth of slow-growing plants. To say that field management has no effect is actually a manifestation of right-leaning conservative thinking.

Strengthening field management is an important link in achieving high yields of sweet potatoes, as has been proven by countless facts. For example, experiments at the former North China Agricultural Science Research Institute showed that applying quick-acting fertilizer 41 days after sweet potato planting increased yields by more than 1,400 jin per mu. Foliar spraying of phosphorus in the later stages of growth can also increase yields by 11%-14%. A survey in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, showed that applying 5-10 jin of ammonium sulfate or 200 jin of plant ash per mu increased yields by 7%-15%. Field management is particularly important for sweet potatoes, and this is determined by their biological characteristics. After sweet potatoes are planted, many young roots are initially formed; later, they differentiate into tuberous roots (i.e., the edible parts), absorbing roots (fine roots), or "burdock roots." With suitable soil temperature and humidity, ventilation and light, plus sufficient fertilizer mainly composed of potash fertilizer, the young roots change into tuberous roots; conversely, dry and compacted soil forms "burdock roots"; and in the case of excessive nitrogen fertilizer, insufficient sunlight, and excessive humidity, only fine roots grow, and no tubers are formed. In short, the quantity and size of sweet potato tubers largely depend on the growing conditions after planting, such as soil fertility, soil temperature and humidity, and ventilation and light conditions. It can be seen that sweet potatoes not only need management, but also require technical expertise. As long as field management is carried out according to the growth habits of sweet potatoes, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort and significantly increase yields.

What should be focused on in the current field management of sweet potatoes? Although this year's sweet potatoes were planted early, planted well, and grown well; since August, alternating droughts and floods have threatened sweet potato growth. Therefore, constantly fighting against natural disasters is the central link in the current field management of sweet potatoes. Water is an important component of sweet potato tubers, accounting for about 65%-75% of the tuber weight, and drought is extremely detrimental to sweet potato growth. Therefore, timely irrigation during the dry season can significantly increase yields. According to experiments at the Chuxian Prefecture Farm in Anhui Province, irrigation increased sweet potato yields by 27.5% compared to non-irrigation in dry conditions. Excessive soil moisture, on the other hand, suffocates sweet potato respiration, affects tuber growth, and even causes rot. Last year, there was excessive rainfall in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province in July and August, and tuber growth stopped for as long as 40 days. Therefore, in rainy areas or rainy seasons, ditching and drainage are prerequisites for the normal growth of sweet potatoes and cannot be ignored.

Seizing the opportunity to topdress is of great significance for increasing sweet potato yields. This year's sweet potatoes were planted early, have a long growing season, and grow luxuriantly, greatly increasing the need for fertilizer. Some summer and autumn sweet potatoes had less base fertilizer applied in order to rush planting, and some were planted on bare land; in addition, some areas relaxed sweet potato management during the rush of the summer harvest, with more weeds in the fields, consuming some nutrients and affecting sweet potato growth. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to apply some quick-acting fertilizers to sweet potatoes.

After the wheat harvest, various places have already taken some measures for sweet potato management, carrying out a concentrated effort to eliminate weeds in sweet potato fields. Currently, the phenomena of rampant weeds and weed infestation have been eliminated. However, it would be wrong to think that there is no need for intertillage after the weeds have been eliminated. The role of intertillage is not only to eliminate weeds, but also to loosen the soil, resist drought and preserve moisture, and promote rapid tuber growth. For sweet potatoes that have not filled the ridges, the opportunity should be seized to combine topdressing with one or two more intertillages and soil cultivation.

Last year, the beet armyworm was widespread and caused great harm to sweet potatoes. Currently, some areas are reporting that the beet armyworm has begun to occur again, and individual areas have already seen outbreaks, which deserves serious attention. All localities should do a good job in forecasting and prediction, and control and prevent them as soon as they are discovered, and eliminate them as early as possible.

To strive for overproduction of sweet potatoes, leadership must be strengthened. All agricultural tasks must be properly arranged, and sweet potato field management should be placed in the important position it deserves.

    甘薯增产潜力大，后期管理要加强
    本报评论员
    从目前作物生长情况来看，中稻和早秋杂粮即将成熟，一般地说，只需要注意防护，加工施肥已不是迫切需要的了。甘薯、晚稻、晚秋作物等还正在发育生长，加工施肥还可以大大提高产量。因此，把人力物力较多地用在这些作物上，加强田间管理，对于完成全年的粮食生产计划有重要的意义。
    在秋收作物中，收获期较晚、增产潜力最大的莫过于甘薯。从甘薯的生物学特性来看，它与一般谷类作物不同，不受早期形成的穗数和粒数的限制，只要温度够，水肥条件好，直到收获的时候，薯块都可以不断膨大。目前，春甘薯距收获还有一个多月时间，夏甘薯收的更要晚些，南方秋薯还足有两个多月的生长时期。这个期间正是甘薯地上部和地下部迅速生长、需肥需水最为迫切的时期，也是田间管理最重要的阶段。
    有些干部认为甘薯是粗粮，又容易腐烂，放弃了对甘薯生产的领导，不注意加强薯田管理。这种看法和作法是错误的。生活实践告诉我们，甘薯不但吃法多、用法多，而且产量高，是不少地区农村的“半年粮”。在甘薯种得比较多的地区，谁如果不注意甘薯生产，势必脱离群众。
    有些人认为，甘薯是“懒庄稼”，无肥无水，不用管理，也一样有收。诚然，甘薯是适应性强的作物，产量比较稳定；但是，不可忽视它是增产潜力极大的作物，如果管理得好，特别是在生长的关键时期，认真执行重要的增产措施，常常可以成倍增产。既然加强主观努力就可以得到更高的产量，为什么不干呢？
    还有些人认为，甘薯增产潜力固然大，但是产量的高低主要看基础打的如何，如基肥多、耕地深、密植适宜，都决定于插植时期；插上以后就大局已定，管与不管关系就不大了。这种想法也是非常有害的。固然，种的好坏十分重要；但是，打好了基础并不等于万事大吉。我们知道，薯块的形成和膨大是地上茎叶进行光合作用，制造养分，向根部输送的结果。有旺盛的茎叶，甘薯才能高产。谁也知道，地上部的生长和田间管理有密切关系；追肥浇水、中耕锄草，三类苗可以变为一类苗，生长慢的可以大大加快生长。说田间管理不起作用，实际上是右倾保守思想在作怪。
    加强田间管理是甘薯丰产的重要环节，已为无数事实所证实。如前华北农业科学研究所试验，甘薯插后四十一天追施速效肥料，每亩增产一千四百多斤。在生长后期根外喷磷，还可以增产11％—14％。山东省莱阳专区调查，每亩施硫铵五斤至十斤或草木灰二百斤，增产在7％—15％之间。田间管理对甘薯特别重要，这是它的生物学特性决定的。甘薯插植以后，最初形成的是很多幼根；以后，分化成为块根（即食用的部分）、吸收根（细根）或“牛蒡根”。有适宜的土壤温湿度、通风透光，再加上以钾肥为主的充足肥料，幼根就向块根变化；反之，土壤干旱、板结，就形成“牛蒡根”；而在氮肥过多、日照不足、湿度过大的情况下，就只长细根，不能结薯。总之，甘薯结薯的多少、大小，在很大程度上决定于插植后的生长条件，如土壤肥力、土壤温湿度和通风透光情况等等。可见甘薯不仅需要管理，还要讲究技术。只要根据甘薯生长习性进行田间管理，就可以事半功倍，显著增产。
    当前甘薯的田间管理，应该抓些什么？今年的甘薯虽说种得早、种得好、长得好；但是，8月份以来，旱涝交错，威胁着甘薯生长。因此，不断向自然灾害作斗争，是当前甘薯田间管理的中心环节。水是甘薯薯块的重要组成部分，约占薯重的65％—75％，干旱对甘薯生长是极不利的。因此，在干旱季节及时的进行灌溉，可以显著增产。据安徽省滁县专区农场试验，在干旱的情况下，浇水比不浇水的甘薯增产27.5％。土壤水分过多，又会窒息甘薯呼吸作用，影响薯块生长，甚至发生腐烂。去年江苏省宿迁县7、8月份多雨，薯块停止生长达四十天之久。因此，在多雨地区或多雨季节，开沟排水是甘薯正常生长的先决条件，不可忽视。
    抓紧时机追肥对甘薯增产有重要意义。今年甘薯种得早，生长期又长，长的繁茂，对肥料的需要量大大增加。部分夏秋甘薯为了争取早插抢时间，基肥施的较少，有的白地栽插；还有一些地区在突击夏收时一度放松甘薯管理，田间杂草较多，消耗了部分养料，影响了甘薯生长。因此，抓紧时机，给甘薯补施一些速效性肥料，是十分必要的。
    麦收以后，各地对甘薯管理已经采取了一些措施，突击消灭甘薯田间杂草。目前，杂草丛生和草荒现象已经消灭。但是，如果认为消灭了杂草就无须中耕，那是不对的。中耕的作用不仅在于消灭杂草，它还有疏松土壤、抗旱保墒、促使薯块迅速生长的作用。对于没有满垅的甘薯，应当抓紧时机，结合追肥，再中耕培土一两次。
    去年斜纹夜盗蛾普遍发生，对甘薯危害很大。目前，有些地区反映，斜纹夜盗蛾又开始发生，个别的地区已经盛发，值得引起严重警惕。各地要作好预测预报，随发现随防治，及早扑灭。
    争取甘薯超产，必须加强领导。必须妥善安排各项农活，把甘薯田间管理工作放在它应占的重要地位。
