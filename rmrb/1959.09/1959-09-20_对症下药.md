    Treating the Symptoms
    Ke Yang
    Currently, a mass-scale movement for increasing production and practicing economy is unfolding vigorously across the country. The masses are high-spirited and full of energy.
    However, some cadres still lack sufficient understanding of this issue ideologically, and their actions are slow and procrastinating. In their areas, there is no vitality, but rather listlessness; no soaring spirit, but rather despondency; lacking the optimism of a revolutionary, they only sigh in the face of difficulties. Lenin once bluntly called such people "not socialists" (Lenin: From the Destruction of the Old System to the Creation of the New), because they suffer from a kind of right-leaning stubbornness.
    For those with this right-leaning problem, the first need is to "fight the drought" in their thinking. Only by eliminating the threat of the "drought tiger" in their minds will their actions become active, their energy surge, the difficulties facing them be overcome, and the mass movement in their areas develop vigorously. We know that for seedlings to grow strong, water is essential; similarly, for people's thoughts and actions to be vigorous, some "water" is also essential. This "water" is the revolutionary practice of the masses, and it is Marxist-Leninist theory.
    Why do the revolutionary practice of the masses and Marxist-Leninist theory make people vigorous? This is because some people with right-leaning stubbornness are "blind," and "all they see is darkness." (Preface to the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"). They are completely blind to the bright side of the masses' lives and suffer from a kind of one-sidedness. No matter who it is, as long as they suffer from this disease, they will be listless and yawn a lot when doing things. An important way to cure this disease is to "take some time to go among the masses, see what the masses are thinking and doing, find advanced experiences from them, and promote them." (Ibid.) As long as he sincerely stands with the masses and participates in the struggle to change reality, he will be able to see how difficulties are conquered one by one by the masses, and after conquering the difficulties, he will feel comfortable and more and more energetic. However, there are still some people who, even if they go down, still cannot open their eyes and still cannot see the favorable conditions and the bright and promising situation. For these people, simply asking them to take some time to go among the masses does not completely solve the problem. Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously use another important method, combined with comprehensive treatment. This method is what Chairman Mao often taught us, to study Marxist-Leninist theory, especially to study some revolutionary dialectics, so that we can be more comprehensive and less one-sided. When going to the countryside and factories, be able to throw away our colored glasses and pick up the microscope and telescope of Marxism-Leninism, open our eyes, and carefully observe this rich and colorful objective world, seeing it more deeply, completely, and far. In this way, they will feel that their past steps were wrong, and they will see that what is in front of them is not a darkness but a light, an infinitely beautiful prospect.
    Lenin pointed this out to us more than forty years ago when reading Hegel's "Science of Logic." He highly praised section 225 of Hegel's "Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences." He said that this section is "very good, where 'knowledge' ('theoretical') and 'will', 'practical activity' are described as two aspects, two methods, and two means that both eliminate the 'one-sidedness' of subjectivity and the 'one-sidedness' of objectivity." (Lenin: Philosophical Notebooks, p. 195) It is clear that Lenin completely agreed with Hegel in regarding theory (mainly referring to dialectics) and practice (human practice) as the two main ways to overcome one-sidedness (in subjective thought and in objective action). Today, reviewing Lenin's instructions again is not without benefit to our current practical struggle.

    对症下药
    柯阳
    现在，一个群众规模的增产节约运动正在各地轰轰烈烈地开展着。群众意气奋发，干劲十足。
    但是，也还有一部分干部对这个问题思想上认识不足，行动上迟缓拖沓。在他们那里不是生气勃勃，而是萎靡不振；不是精神昂扬，而是意气消沉；缺少一种革命者应有的乐观主义精神，有的只是在困难面前唉声叹气。列宁曾经很干脆地称这种人“不是社会主义者”（列宁：从破坏历来的旧制度到创造新制度），因为他们害上了一种右倾顽固症。
    有这种右倾毛病的人在思想上首先需要“抗旱”。只有把思想上的“旱老虎”威胁解除了，他们的行动才会积极起来，干劲才能冲天，摆在他们面前的困难才能克服，他们那里的群众运动才能蓬勃地开展起来。我们知道，要使秧苗茁壮地生长起来，没有水是不行的；同样，要使人的思想和行动朝气蓬勃，没有一点“水”也是不行的。这个“水”就是群众的革命实践，就是马克思列宁主义理论。
    为什么群众的革命实践和马克思列宁主义理论能够使人朝气蓬勃呢？这是因为有右倾顽固症的一些人都是“瞎子”，“在他们面前出现的只是一片黑暗”，（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书的按语）他们对于群众生活中光明的一面一概看不见，害了一种片面性的毛病。不管什么人，只要一害上这种病，做起事来就没精打彩，就好打呵欠，伸懒腰。要治好这个病，一个重要的办法是：“拿出一些时间到群众中去走一走，看看群众在想些什么，做些什么，从其中找出先进经验，加以推广”（同上书）。只要他认真地和群众站在一起，参加了变革现实的斗争，他就能够看到困难怎样一个一个地为群众所征服，他在征服困难以后就会感到心情舒畅，劲头越来越大。但是，还有一些人，即使下去了，也还睁不开眼睛，仍然是看不到有利条件，看不到光明的大好形势。对于这些人，仅仅要求他们拿出一些时间到群众中去走走，并不能完全解决问题。因此，必须同时使用另一个重要办法，配合起来，进行综合治疗。这个办法就是毛主席经常教导我们的，要学习马克思列宁主义理论，特别是要学习一些革命的辩证法，使自己多一点全面性，少一点片面性。能够在下乡下厂的时候，扔掉自己的有色眼镜，拿起马克思列宁主义的显微镜和望远镜，睁开眼睛，对这丰富多采的客观世界仔细的观察一番，看得深一些、全一些、远一些。这样，他们就能感到自己过去的步子走错了，就能看到摆在他们面前的不是一片黑暗而是一片光明，是一幅无限美好的前景。
    列宁在四十多年前阅读黑格尔的逻辑学一书时早就给我们指出过这一点，他曾经极力称赞过黑格尔的“哲学全书”第225节。他说这一节“非常之好，在那里‘认识’（‘理论的’）和‘意志’，‘实践活动’被描述为既消灭主观性的‘片面性’，又消灭客观性的‘片面性’的两个方面、两个方法、两个手段。”（列宁：哲学笔记195页）很显明，列宁是完全同意黑格尔把理论（主要是指辩证法）和实践（人的实践）作为克服片面性（主观思想上的和见之于客观行动中的）的两个主要办法的。我们今天重新温习一下列宁的这些指示，对于我们当前的现实斗争，不无补益。
