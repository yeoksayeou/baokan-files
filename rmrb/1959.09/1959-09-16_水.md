    Water
    By our correspondent Gu Lei

    "Water! We still need water!"
    "With water, we will be completely liberated!"
    When the people of Gansu celebrated the destruction of the feudal system in the early days of liberation, they answered the cadres who were asking what else they needed with this ardent hope.

    Water, the most abundant substance on Earth, why has it become so precious in the hearts of the people of Gansu?

    Let's first look at two tragic historical photos. Look, under that low city wall, are filled with large and small earthen pits and densely packed graves. On a small piece of land, lie scattered corpses of men and women. A mother's corpse, her hair disheveled, her chest exposed, her head twisted to one side, lying on her side, as if she died while breastfeeding; the baby lying beside her, head against her mother's chest, as if dying while sucking on her mother's nipple, then sliding to the ground. Another photo is even more heartbreaking. In the wilderness below an earthen ridge, bodies are piled up, intertwined. One of the dead, his whole body intact, only a large piece of flesh from his thigh completely gone, as if cut off with a knife, who can say his flesh was not cut off and eaten!

    The misery in these two photos was caused by "lack of water" under the feudal system - these are the true depictions of two mass graves in Linxia County during the great drought of 1929 in Gansu. This year's drought, coupled with the cruel oppression of reactionary rulers and the landlord class, resulted in the loss of more than two million lives in Gansu!

    Gansu's "water shortage" is nationally known. Located on the Northwest Plateau, the climate here is dry. The average annual rainfall in the province is only about 300 millimeters, and the rainfall in many areas cannot meet the growth needs of crops. Although there are many large and small rivers in the province, the plains on both sides of the rivers do not lack irrigation water. However, most of the province is mountainous and semi-mountainous, with 87% of the arable land on mountains and plateaus. "Water flows to low places," and the mountainous and plateau areas still lack water.

    In the mountains, not only is there no water for irrigation, but there is also a shortage of drinking water! In many arid mountainous areas, a patch of dark clouds in the sky prompts people to hurriedly place all available water containers in their yards! When it snows in winter, people are busy sweeping it up and storing it in cellars and jars to prolong their lives by one year the next year. In Huining County, two-thirds of the people have no water to drink. Once it doesn't rain for several months, people are too thirsty to move, and livestock are too weak to support their limbs. In Hejiashan, Liyao Township, Wushan County, drought forces people to run to the base of mountain rocks more than ten miles away, searching for water dripping from the damp stone walls. People line up, carrying buckets and basins, to collect water under the rocks. Every drop of water falls on people's hearts. When several drops fall in succession, people's faces are filled with smiles. When the drops slow down, people's hearts are immediately suspended. Zhang Mangxue's mother went to fetch water and forgot to close the door. A wolf broke into the house and ate her child! ...

    Due to the low rainfall and the inability of water to reach the mountains, disasters as severe as the 1929 drought were not uncommon before liberation. Records of "great droughts and great famines" and "corpses blocking roads" fill the county chronicles of various counties. From 1644 to 1906, there were 114 droughts of varying sizes, and it is still impossible to investigate how many people starved to death.

    In those difficult years, industrious farmers also had the wisdom to create in order to survive. They dug wells and built canals. After generations of hard work, they built 4.7 million mu of irrigated land out of the province's 50 million mu of arable land. However, these crystallizations of blood and sweat became shackles for farmers who had to pay more rent to the landlords. People still could not escape the threat of hunger. Thus, the sparks of water conservancy construction were extinguished by the exploiters. The incense in front of the Dragon King Temple flourished, as if that was the path to heaven!

    On October 1, 1949, the glorious five-star red flag rose slowly amidst the booming salutes and the joyous laughter of the people! The people of Gansu unloaded a stone as heavy as Mount Tai from their backs: man-made disasters. But what about natural disasters? The cruel drought did not die with the feudal system, but still strode proudly across the land, and the shadow still covered people's hearts. Therefore, some county people, while laughing, told the county party secretary with tears in their eyes: "You ask us what else we need? We still need water, can you give us more water!"

    The Party organization in Gansu accepted the people's request and resolved to thoroughly save the people from poverty, leading the people of the province to engage in the struggle to eliminate drought.

    This is an extremely arduous struggle. To eliminate drought, the first thing that must be solved is the problem of water sources for irrigation in mountainous areas, and solving this problem is certainly not easy. But these difficulties are not the main ones. As long as we rely on the people, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. However, what was the people's state of mind at that time? On the one hand, they were thirsty for water, and on the other hand, many people feared nature. They did not believe that they could overcome drought. When faced with drought, some farmers still carried mud statues of the Dragon King to pray for rain under the scorching sun.

    The power of the people was originally as irresistible as the sea, but it was confined by this dam of fatalism, unable to flow out.

    The Party organization knew the people's hardships, and also knew that inspiring the conscious power latent in the people was a delicate task. The heads of Party organizations at all levels, leading cadres, walked out of their offices, and went to the driest places with the revolutionary's high sense of responsibility and sympathy for the people. They would use the practical results of leading the people to dig a few wells and a few meters of canals as shells to destroy the fatalistic dam in the people's minds and liberate the power of the people.

    In the spring of 1956, Bao Haizhen, the county head of Wushan County, according to the instructions of the county party committee, led a visiting group to Liyao Township, where the tragedy of a child being eaten by a wolf while waiting for water had occurred.

    "What are your opinions on the government?" Bao Haizhen asked.

    "Life is getting better day by day, what other opinions do we have!" several farmers said with a smile.

    "Do you have any requests?"

    "We do, but we are afraid it can't be done. Get us water!"

    "Okay, we will definitely find a way for you." Bao Haizhen promised.

    "Alas, then life will be better." the farmers sighed.

    When Bao Haizhen left Liyao Township, he said to Li Hua, the deputy director of the Water Conservancy Section: "You stay here to help the masses dig wells and find water. You are not allowed to return to the county until you complete the task. We have a responsibility to relieve the people's suffering." "Okay." Li Hua firmly stated.

    The Li Hua who stayed behind received a warm welcome from the masses. People slaughtered chickens to treat those who helped find water. Late at night, Li Hua dug a deep pit on a hillside and placed a bowl upside down inside. The next morning, he ran to turn the bowl over, and there were many water droplets on the bottom of the bowl. This was a symbol of water, a method of finding groundwater that Li Hua learned from old farmers, but the water droplets were too small, indicating that the groundwater level was too deep. That day, Li Hua mobilized everyone through the branch to dig a well. People stood aside and shook their heads. People doubted: Our ancestors have been digging wells for generations, and we have never found water! After repeated mobilization, people lazily walked towards the place where the well was to be dug. Li Hua, worked with everyone. A shallow well shaft appeared, but no one was willing to go down. Li Hua, bravely jumped down. One zhang, two zhang, still no sign of water. The people above were disappointed, and one by one slipped away.

    Li Hua was very ashamed, blaming himself for not completing the task and embarrassed to bother the masses again. He ran to Luomen Town, forty to fifty miles away, bought a hoe, a basket, and some dry food, and walked back to Hejiashan. He patiently mobilized an elderly farmer to help lift the soil at the wellhead, and he went down to the bottom of the well again. Li Hua's actions moved the masses, and the people at the wellhead gradually increased. Three zhang, four zhang... Suddenly, Li Hua's shout came from the well shaft: "Water is out!" "Water is out!" The people on the well also suddenly shouted. People shouted and ran wildly, running to the village, forgetting to lift Li Hua out of the well. It was not until Li Hua's throat was almost hoarse that people happily ran back. Li Hua, covered in mud, was surrounded by everyone and walked back to his residence.

    From the day the water was found, the masses in Liyao Township became active. Men, women, old and young, under the leadership of Li Hua, dug wells, dug cellars, and built irrigated land. The dry mountains that had been arid for thousands of years now had irrigated land.

    Just like Li Hua leading the masses to dig wells, cadres all over the province have used every small achievement in water conservancy construction to destroy the dam of fatalism and inspire the people's conscious power over the past few years. Although the foundation of this dam has begun to shake, it has not completely collapsed. Many people feel that digging wells and building cellars on the mountains is a solution, but it cannot solve the problem of large-scale irrigation. Water does not reach the mountains, and a happy life will not come. People are still anxiously wandering on the crossroads of whether they can overcome drought!

    The Party led the farmers who embarked on the road of collectivization to continue to advance, using the power of the collective to continue to charge towards the drought, continue to attack the dam of fatalism, and continue to seize wealth from nature...

    The people of Wushan County stood at the forefront of the struggle. In the autumn of 1956, the farmers of nine agricultural cooperatives on Dongliang Mountain in this county broke superstitions, relied on the power of collectivization, overcame countless difficulties, and built a mountain-side canal sixty li long, bringing clear springs from the distant Yunwu Mountain, allowing more than 30,000 mu of land that had been arid for thousands of years to "drink" water; it also relieved the suffering of women in the mountains who had to go down the mountain to carry water.

    This "Dongliang Canal" has a height difference of 180 meters from the river below the mountain. It is entirely a high mountain canal. Although the water flow in the canal is only 0.2 cubic meters per second, it made nature tremble! It is a powerful artillery shell, blasting open the fatalistic dam that hinders the advancement of water conservancy, and the wisdom of the people burst out of the dam, unstoppable! People said: "People are the same, the mountains are the same size, water can reach Dongliang Mountain, what mountain can't it reach!" In Gansu Province, from south to north, from east to west, thousands of people, climbed mountains and crossed ridges, to find water sources, inspect canal lines, and traveled to places rarely seen by people in the past! Tens of thousands of people, holding high the red flag, carrying tools, swayed like long dragons, climbing high mountains and plateaus!

    In those days when the power of the people burst out of the dam, the people of Yongjing County created the miracle of diverting Yellow River water to the mountains. The people of this county, designed themselves, to build a "Hero Canal" thirty-five kilometers long, to divert Yellow River water to the dry mountains. This canal, must cross the Yellow River, and a aqueduct must be built on the Yellow River for the water to reach the mountains. In the place where people planned to build the aqueduct, according to legend, it was the place where Lu Ban failed to build a bridge. To this day, countless huge stones prepared for building the bridge are still left on the Luban Beach. Later, someone wrote a poem to lament for Lu Ban: "Stone peaks towering, waves surging sand, green mountains on both sides separated by water cliffs, the first famous bridge cannot be retained, ancient stele lies in reeds with hatred." However, the canal-building heroes of Yongjing County, did what Lu Ban could not do, they climbed Zhadishan, Sanfo Cliff, split mountains to open canals, and built a aqueduct with a span of seventeen meters across the Yellow River with wood, successfully diverting the Yellow River water across the Yellow River and to the mountains to irrigate the land.

    One victory after another further encouraged the people's soaring enthusiasm, and people became fearless! In the arid mountainous areas of Dingxi, Tianshui, and Pingliang prefectures, and in all parts of the province, the upsurge of building water diversion projects to the mountains wave after wave, mountain canals, one longer than another, one wider than another, and one more ambitious than another. In less than a year, more than 3,000 water diversion canals to the mountains appeared in the province. People said happily under the fluttering red flag with red faces: "We are going to ride the Dragon King to plant crops!"

    At this time, the "Mountain Canal" was born, and a 1,400-kilometer-long high mountain river project began construction!

    This "Mountain Canal" is the nationally famous Yintao Mountain Diversion Project. The Tao River originates from the northern foot of the Minshan Mountains in southern Gansu. This river is high above, rushing north, and flows from Minxian through Weiyuan, Lintao to the south of Liujiaxia and into the Yellow River. The land east of the Tao River, however, is threatened by drought. The Yintao Mountain Diversion Project is to block the Tao River at Gucheng Village, Minxian County, 2,350 meters above sea level upstream, so that it turns back to the east, passes through Huajialing in Huining County, and leads to Dongzhiyuan in Qingyang County, 1,400 meters above sea level. The completion of this "Mountain Canal" can irrigate 20 million mu of land. Currently, 600 kilometers of river channels have started construction. On the cliffs of the Shimen Gorge and Jiudian Gorge of the Tao River, people are hanging in mid-air, with the clear blue sky above their heads and the thousand-foot abyss of the Tao River below their feet, relying on a hammer and a steel chisel to lift the ancient Tao River and embed it in the mountainside 200 meters above the water surface. People are advancing in high spirits: "Since ancient times, there has been a legend of the Milky Way, who has seen the water of the Milky Way, millions of troops build canals, the Milky Way passes by our door."

    This year, Gansu has been liberated for ten years. These ten years have been the ten years in which farmers throughout the province have fought against drought under the leadership of the Party. Ten years, is a fleeting moment in social history, and the changes in Gansu are so great, the dam of fatalism has collapsed, and the sense of ownership of people in the face of nature has been established. Along with this great change came the glorious victory of water conservancy construction throughout the province. This year, the province's irrigated land has reached 18.7 million mu, which is more than four times that of the year of liberation. Years of good harvests have followed one after another. In 1949, the province's grain output was 3.9 billion jin, and by 1957 it reached 8.5 billion jin. This year's grain output will be at least 10 billion jin.

    This year, I went to Dongliang Mountain again, where the fragrance of rice flowers that had never been there before was floating. I don't want to introduce here the specific changes in the lives of the people of Dongliang Mountain. What's so good about writing that? Everyone knows that they have long been well-fed and warmly clothed, the water mills on the mountains have long been turning, and the hydroelectric power stations have long begun to transmit electricity. What I am most interested in is the three murals in the courtyard of the commune office.

    The first picture depicts the past. There is a song on the painting: The north mountain is poor, the south mountain is rich, nothing is more bitter than Dongliang Mountain, to eat and grind flour you have to go down the mountain, no girl will marry into Baijia Mountain! The picture shows: bare mountaintops, rugged mountain roads, crowds of people going down the mountain to fetch water, people's sad faces, livestock that died by falling off the cliffs, dilapidated houses in the village, a picture of suffering.

    The second picture depicts the present. There is also a song on the painting: Baijia Mountain of ten thousand ages, now becomes a plain, water mill turns high on the mountains, dry land becomes paddy fields, lighting lamps does not require oil, marrying a wife is not a worry. The picture is: water mills, electric lights, green trees, glass windows, tap water, full granaries, schools, nurseries, crops growing luxuriantly on terraced fields, young men and women sitting hand in hand under big trees. The girls on Dongliang Mountain were afraid of going down the mountain to fetch water and were willing to marry into the plains. In 1953 alone, thirteen went down the mountain. After water reached the mountains, from 1956 to 1958, twenty-six girls married into the mountains. This is a picture of joy.

    The third picture looks forward to the future. The song on the painting says: Baijia Mountain of ten thousand ages, built into a paradise, rural urbanization, tractors on the mountains, scientific popularization, happiness for ten thousand years. The picture includes: tall buildings, neat streets, cinemas, factory chimneys, clubs, universities, scientific research rooms, tractor stations, greened residential areas... a picture of boundless happiness.

    The three paintings on Baijia Mountain summarize the past, present and future of the rural areas of Gansu. How different is the depiction of present life from the two mass grave photos in the front! If you ask them, what else do you need today? The answer you get is unusual: "Now? To seize more wealth from nature!" (Attached picture)

    Baijiashan Village, which benefited first from the construction of the Dongliang Canal, had another bumper wheat harvest this year.

    水
    本报记者　顾雷
    “水！我们还需要水！”
    “有了水，就算彻底翻身了！”
    当甘肃人民在解放初期，喜庆摧毁了封建制度的时候，他们怀着殷切的希望，这样回答征询他们还有什么要求的干部。
    水，是地球上最多的物质，为什么在甘肃人民心中变得这样珍贵？
    我们先看两张惨绝人寰的历史照片吧。你看，在那矮矮的城墙下，布满了大大小小的土坑和密密麻麻的坟堆。在一片不大的土地上，狼籍着男男女女的尸体。一具母亲的尸体，头发蓬松着，胸口袒露，脑袋歪扭在一边，侧着身子，像是奶孩子的时候死去的；躺在她旁边的婴儿，头靠着母亲的胸膛，像正在吸吮母亲的奶头时死掉，以后滑落在地上的。另一张照片，更令人痛心。荒野中一条土坎下面，尸体枕籍，交错堆在一起。其中一位死者，全身完整无损，只有一条大腿上的肉完全没有了，像是用刀子整片割下去的，谁能说他的肉不是被人割去吃了呢！
    这两张照片上的惨状，就是在封建制度下，由于“缺水”造成的——这是1929年甘肃大旱时临夏县两个万人坑的写真。这一年的大旱，加上反动统治者和地主阶级的残酷压榨，全甘肃有二百多万人丧失了生命！
    甘肃的“缺水”，是全国著称的。这里地处西北高原，气候干燥，全省平均每年降雨量只有三百毫米左右，许多地区降雨量不能满足农作物的生长需要；省内虽然有许多大小河流，河流两岸的平川，不缺灌溉的水源，但全省绝大部分地区是山区和半山区，87％的耕地在山上和塬上，“水往低处流”，山区和塬上还是缺水。
    在山区何止没水灌溉，连人吃的水都缺少啊！许多干旱山区，天空的一片乌云，引得人们急忙在院子里摆上所有能够盛水的器皿！冬天落下雪，人们忙着扫起来，藏在地窖和罐子里，留第二年延长一岁寿命。在会宁县，有三分之二的人没有水吃，一旦几个月不落雨，人渴的不能动弹，牲畜渴的无力撑起四肢。在武山县的李窑乡何家山，干旱逼着人们跑到十几里路以外的山岩下面，寻找阴湿的石壁上滴下的水滴。人们排着队，带着桶、盆子，放在岩下接水。每一滴水都滴在人们的心上，连着落下来几滴，人们面上堆满了笑容，慢下来几滴，人们的心马上被吊起了。张忙学的母亲等水去了，忘记关门，狼闯进屋子，把孩子吃掉了！……。
    由于降雨量少，水不上山，在解放前，像1929年那样惨重的旱灾，并不是绝无仅有的。“大旱大饥”、“积尸梗道”的记载，挤满了各个县的县志，1644年到1906年的二百六十二年间，这里就发生过大小旱灾一百一十四次，至今无法考查究竟饿死了多少人。
    在那苦难的岁月里，勤劳的农民，为了生存，也有着智慧的创造，他们打井修渠，经过几十代的艰辛努力，在全省五千万亩耕地中，修起了四百七十万亩水浇地，但是，这些血汗的结晶，却变成了农民必须向地主交纳更多地租的枷锁，人们仍然摆脱不了饥饿的威胁，于是，兴修水利的火花，被剥削者们扑灭了。龙王庙前的香火旺盛了，似乎那就是通向天堂之路！
    1949年10月1日，光辉灿烂的五星红旗，在隆隆的礼炮声中，在人们狂欢的笑声中冉冉升起了！甘肃人民从背上卸下了像泰山那样重的一块石头：人祸。可是，天灾呢？残酷的干旱没有随着封建制度一起死去，仍然威风凛凛地在大地上昂首阔步地走来走去，暗影仍然罩住人们的心。因此有些县的人民，在欢笑的时候，噙着眼泪告诉县委书记：“你问我们还需要什么吗？我们还需要水，再给我们水好吗！”
    甘肃党的组织接受了人民的要求，决心彻底拯救人民摆脱贫困的境地，领导全省人民投入了消灭干旱的斗争。
    这是一场异常艰苦的斗争。要消灭干旱，首先必须解决山区灌溉的水源问题，而解决这个问题，当然不是轻而易举的。但是这些困难还不是主要的。我们一切事业，只要依靠人民，没有完不成的。可是，当时人民的思想状况是什么呢？一方面，是渴求着有水，而另一方面是不少人对大自然的畏惧，他们不敢相信自己能够战胜干旱，遇到干旱，有些农民，还是在灼热的阳光下，抬着泥塑的龙王爷求雨。
    人民的力量本来像海水一样不可抗御，然而却被这宿命的堤坝禁锢着，无法奔流出来。
    党组织知道人民的苦衷，也知道启发出潜藏在人民身上的自觉力量是一件细致的工作。各级党组织的负责人，率领着干部走出了办公室，带着革命者对人民高度的责任感和同情心走向最干旱的地方，他们要用领导人民打几眼井、挖几公尺渠道的实效，当作炮弹，炸毁人民思想中的宿命堤坝，把人民的力量解放出来。
    1956年春天，武山县县长包海珍，根据县委指示，带着访问团到了曾经发生过因为等水而小孩被狼吃掉的李窑乡。
    “大家对政府有什么意见？”包海珍问。
    “日子一天比一天好，还有啥意见呢！”几个农民笑着说。
    “没有什么要求吗？”
    “有倒是有，就怕办不到。给我们弄水来！”
    “好吧，一定给你们想办法。”包海珍答应道。
    “唉，那日子就好过了。”农民们叹息说。
    包海珍离开李窑乡时，跟水利科副科长李华说：“你留在这里帮助群众打井，找水，完不成任务不准回县。我们有责任解除人民的疾苦。”“可以。”李华坚定地表示。
    留下的李华受到群众热烈的招待，人们杀鸡款待帮助找水的人。夜深了，李华在一个山坡上挖了一个深坑，里面倒扣着一个碗。第二天早晨，他跑去把碗翻过来，碗底上有许多水珠。这是有水的象征，是李华从老农民那里学来的找地下水的方法，只是水珠太小，说明地下水位太深。这天，李华通过支部动员大家挖井。人们站在一旁摇头。人们怀疑：祖祖辈辈都打井，从来没有打出过水呀！经过再三动员，人们懒散地向打井的地方走去。李华，和大家一块劳动，浅浅的井筒出现了，谁也不愿意下去。李华，勇敢地跳了下去。一丈、两丈，仍看不见水的影子。上面的人失望了，一个一个溜走了。
    李华很惭愧，责备自己没有完成任务，不好意思再去麻烦群众。他跑到四五十里以外的洛门镇，买了一张镢、一个筐、一点干粮，背着走回何家山。他耐心地动员一位年老的农民在井口帮助提土，自己又下到了井底。李华的行动感动着群众，井口上的人逐渐多起来。三丈、四丈……井筒里突然传出了李华的叫声：“出水了！”“出水了！”井上的人也突然叫唤起来。人们疯狂地叫着、跑着，向村里跑去，竟忘记把李华从井里提上来，直到李华嗓子快喊哑了，人们才乐哈哈地跑了回来。李华带着满身泥水，被大家拥簇着走回住处。
    从打出水的那一天起，李窑乡的群众活跃了，男的、女的、老的、小的，在李华的带动下打井、打窑、修水地。干旱了几千年的干山上有了水地了。
    就像李华领导群众打井那样，全省各地的干部，几年来用每一个微小的水利建设成就去摧毁宿命的堤坝，启发人民的自觉力量。虽然这坝的基础开始动摇了，却没有完全崩溃。许多人觉得：在山上打井、修窑是个办法，但是不能解决大面积的灌溉问题。水不上山，幸福生活不会降临，人们依然焦急地徘徊在能不能战胜干旱的歧路上！
    党领导走上了合作化道路的农民继续前进，用集体的力量继续向干旱冲锋，继续进攻宿命的堤坝，继续向大自然夺取财富……。
    武山县的人民，站在斗争的前列。1956年秋天，这个县东梁山上九个农业社的农民，破除了迷信，依靠合作化的力量，克服了千难万苦，修了一条长达六十里的傍山渠道，从遥远的云雾山引来清泉，让山上干旱了几千年的三万多亩土地“喝”上了水；也解除了山上妇女下山担水的痛苦。
    这条“东梁渠”，与山下河流高差一百八十公尺。完全是一条高山渠道。尽管渠中的水流不过零点二秒立方米，然而它却使大自然战栗了！它是一颗威力巨大的炮弹，炸开了阻碍水利事业前进的宿命大堤，人民的智慧破堤而出了，不可遏止！人们说：“人是一样人，山都一样大，水能上东梁山，什么山上不去呢！”在甘肃省，从南到北，从东到西，万千个人，登山越岭，去寻找水源，察看渠线，走遍了过去人迹罕见的地方！千万个人，高举红旗，扛着工具，如长龙一样摆动，爬上高山大塬！
    在那人民力量破堤而出的日子里，永靖县的人民，创造了引黄河水上山的奇迹。这个县的人民，自己设计，要修一条长达三十五公里的“英雄渠”，把黄河水引上干山。这条渠道，要横渡黄河，要在黄河上修上一座渡槽，水才能上山。在人们计划修建渡槽的地方，据传说，正是鲁班修桥失败的地方，至今在那鲁班滩上，还丢着无数块准备修桥的巨石，后来曾经有人作诗替鲁班惋惜：“石峰滔浪浪滔沙，两岸青山隔水崖，第一名桥留不住，古碑含恨卧芦花。”但是，永靖县的修渠英雄们，却干了鲁班干不了的事，他们爬上扎地山、三佛崖，劈山开渠，用木头在黄河上架起了一座孔跨度十七米的渡槽，胜利地把黄河水引过了黄河，引到了山上，去浇灌土地。
    一个接着一个的胜利，更加鼓起了人们的冲天干劲，人们变得无所畏惧了！在定西、天水、平凉专区的干旱山区，在全省各地，兴修引水上山工程的高潮，一浪盖过一浪，上山渠道，一条比一条长，一条比一条宽，一条比一条的气魄大。不到一年的时间，全省出现了三千多条引水上山渠道。人们在飘展的红旗下，满面红光乐哈哈地说：“我们要骑着龙王种庄稼了！”
    这时，诞生了“山上运河”，一条长一千四百公里的高山河流动工了！
    这条“山上运河”就是全国闻名的引洮上山工程。洮河发源于甘肃南部岷山的北麓，这条河居高临下，奔腾向北，由岷县经渭源、临洮至刘家峡南面流入黄河。洮河东面的土地，却受着干旱的威胁。引洮上山工程，就是要在上游拔海二千三百五十米的岷县古城村，把洮河水拦住，使它回头向东流，通过会宁县的华家岭，引向庆阳县境内拔海一千四百米的董志塬。修成这条“山上运河”，可以灌地两千万亩。现在，已有六百公里的河道动工兴修。在洮河石门峡、九甸峡的悬崖上，人们吊在半空里，头上是青天万里晴空，脚下是洮河千尺深渊，靠着一把锤，一根钢钎，要把古老的洮河提起，嵌在离水面高二百米的山腰里。人们正在高歌猛进：“自古传说有银河，银河之水谁见过，百万大军修运河，银河从咱门前过。”
    今年，甘肃已经解放十年，这十年，是全省农民在党的领导下向干旱斗争的十年。十年，是社会历史转瞬即逝的时刻，而甘肃的变化有多么大呀，宿命的堤坝崩溃了，人在大自然面前的主人翁感确立了，随着这个巨变而来的，是全省水利建设的辉煌胜利，到今年全省的水地已经达到一千八百七十万亩，等于解放那年的四倍多，丰收的年景一个接着一个。1949年，全省粮食产量三十九亿斤，到1957年即达到八十五亿斤了。今年粮食产量至少在一百亿斤以上。
    今年，我又到了东梁山，那里已飘起了从来没有过的稻花香。我不想在这里介绍东梁山人民生活的具体变化，那有什么好写的呢，谁都知道他们早已饱食暖衣了，山上的水磨早已转动了，水力发电站早已开始送电了。对我兴趣最大的，是公社办公室院子里的三幅壁画。
    第一幅是表现过去的。画上有一首歌：穷北山富南山，苦焦不过东梁山，吃水磨面要下山，有女不嫁柏家山！画面上是：光光的山顶，崎岖的山路，下山挑水的人群，人们愁苦的面容，崖下摔死的牲口，村中破烂的房屋，是一幅苦难图。
    第二幅是描写现在的。画上也有一首歌：万古柏家山，如今变平川，水磨高山转，旱地变水田，点灯不用油，娶妻不发愁。画面是：水磨、电灯、绿树、玻璃窗、自来水、满仓粮食、学校、托儿所、梯田上茂盛的庄稼、大树底下青年男女携手并坐。东梁山上的姑娘怕到山下挑水，都愿意嫁给川里人，1953年一年走下山去的有十三个。水上山以后，1956年到1958年，有二十六个姑娘嫁到了山上。这是一幅欢乐图。
    第三幅是向往未来的。画上的歌这样写道：万古柏家山，建设成乐园，农村城市化，拖拉机上山，科学普及化，幸福万万年。画中有：高大的楼房、整齐的街道、电影院、工厂的烟囱、俱乐部、大学校、科学研究室、拖拉机站、绿化了的住宅区……。是一幅无边的幸福生活图。
    柏家山上的三幅画，概括着甘肃农村的过去、现在和未来；对于现在生活的描绘，同前面两幅万人坑照片对比，多么不同啊！如果你问他们，今天还有些什么要求？给你的回答却是不平常的：“现在吗？要向大自然索取更多的财富！（附图片）
    修东梁渠首先受益的柏家山村，今年的小麦又获丰收。
