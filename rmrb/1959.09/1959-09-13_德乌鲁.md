    Dewulu
    By our reporter Chen Weiren
　　Leaving Lanzhou, we took a car along the winding road, crossed the densely wooded mountains, and in less than a day, we arrived at an emerging grassland city - Dewulu City, the capital of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Dewulu, this name, people are not very familiar with, it is a grassland shining with golden color. The newly built Dewulu City has two disconnected urban areas, one is called Hezuo (formerly known as Heicuo), where the leading organs of the autonomous prefecture are now stationed; the other is Xiahe, where the famous Labrang Monastery is located. These two urban areas are more than sixty kilometers apart, connected by small agricultural areas and vast grasslands.
　　Before the democratic reform last year, the vast grassland was full of sacred mountains and sacred trees, and even the plateau pikas (i.e. marmots), which seriously damaged the grasslands, became the "incarnation" of the Living Buddha, and were not allowed to be "violated." The reactionary upper classes of the monasteries and tribes said that where there were gods, it was not allowed to pull power lines, dig canals, or build roads. When scientists used microscopes to study soil and geological structures, they spread rumors that the Han people had tied up the "mountain gods" and the Tibetan people would suffer. They deceived, spread rumors, and sowed discord, attempting to maintain their thoroughly corrupt feudal rule. However, from the democratic reform to now, in just one year, not only Dewulu, but the entire Gannan area has undergone earth-shaking changes. The enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups on the grasslands to transform nature and create new life is surging like the rolling Bailong River. Hundreds of thousands of people have traveled all over the "sacred mountains" and found more than 230 mineral sources such as iron, copper, coal, germanium, and crystal, providing the best conditions for the development of production on the grasslands. Now, at the Dewulu Copper Mine in Hezuo, thousands of workers are mining, including more than 500 Tibetan workers. From then on, the Gannan Tibetan area ended its history of not having modern industry.
    Sturdy New Shoots
    Shattering the feudal lid, the national industry of Gannan, like a sturdy new shoot, emerged from the horizon. Taking Hezuo as an example, hydropower plants, mechanical parts factories, milk powder factories, and glass factories have been established one after another, among which the Gannan Dairy Factory was established earlier. During our visit to Dewulu, it left a deep impression on us.
    This dairy factory is one of the most advanced large-scale dairy factories in China. Except for finished product packaging, the production process is fully mechanized and semi-automated. Since it was built and put into production on July 1, 1957, it has mainly produced milk powder and butter, but it has also successfully trial-produced more than a dozen products such as egg powder, canned beef and mutton, and casein. Its "Golden Bull Brand" milk powder has been sold abroad since 1958 and has been continuously well received.
    In early June, when the milk production season in pastoral areas just began to enter its peak, in Gannan, we often encountered trucks from the factory pulling fresh milk at various commune milk collection stations on the road. The vast pastoral areas within a hundred miles around Hezuo supply fresh milk to the dairy factory, directly benefiting from the development of industry. Now, the purchase price of fresh milk is 15 cents per catty, and herdsmen can earn 15 yuan for selling 100 catties of fresh milk. In the past, fresh milk was processed by the herdsmen themselves, producing five catties of butter per hundred catties, worth only six yuan. We saw from the survey materials that in the year the dairy factory started production alone, six areas including Xiahe increased their income by more than 130,000 yuan due to the sale of fresh milk. A herdsman family in the Amuguhfu tribe went from having two cows to having three cows after selling milk for five months.
    In a simple office, the enthusiastic factory director talked to us about the short history of the dairy factory's development. When he turned the topic to the factory's dozen Tibetan workers, we felt even more deeply that the development of national industry in pastoral areas has a far-reaching significance than increasing economic income. This is the first time in history that a modern working class has emerged among the Tibetan people. In June and July last year, when the reactionary herdowners, chieftains, and religious upper classes on the grasslands openly engaged in rebellion, opposing the Communist Party, opposing cooperation, and opposing socialism, the Tibetan workers in the factory firmly stood up to safeguard the truth and progress, standing on the side of socialism, and worked day and night with the workers of the entire factory to stand guard, protect the factory, and volunteered to lead the way for the troops chasing and suppressing the bandits. Over the past few years, they have deeply understood from their own personal experience that cooperation and socialism are the common road to happiness and prosperity for all ethnic groups, and defending it is defending the truth and adhering to progress.
    Tibetan Village on Sangke Grassland
    Not far south of Labrang Monastery, surrounded by grassy hills on all sides, there is a fertile and vast grassland, which is the famous Sangke Grassland. After communization last year, a production team of the Labrang Commune on Sangke Grassland is now familiarly called the Sangke Team.
    The Sangke Team's grassland is one hundred li long from north to south and sixty to seventy li wide from east to west. The entire team has 517 households, all of whom are Tibetans except for two Hui households, with a population of 2,210 people, including 1,237 male and female laborers. Compared with the vast majority of areas in the mainland, this can be regarded as a vast and sparsely populated place. What makes us feel novel is that for the first time in history, a "Tibetan village" has appeared on the ancient Sangke Grassland.
    Not far from entering Sangke from Labrang, we saw a dark mass of "houses" from a distance. It was clear that the surrounding area was newly reclaimed virgin land. When we got closer, we found that a large area of ​​"houses" turned out to be made up of herdsmen's tents. We have seen tents in other places, but they are all single households, like lonely sails in the vast grassland. This is very different here. Rather than saying it is like a village, it is more like a military camp described in classical novels. The tents in the camp are tightly connected, people can hear each other's chickens and dogs, and they are as close as a family. The day we went was Sunday. The Tibetan children were not in school. As soon as we arrived at the edge of the "village", the children surrounded us. Although we couldn't understand the language, seeing the children's innocent smiles, a warm current immediately passed through our whole body. Sangke Elementary School has more than 300 students, five teachers, four Han Chinese, and one Tibetan, all of whom can teach in Tibetan. They have established close relationships with students and children's parents. Not long ago, when the parents heard that a Han teacher was going to transfer, they cried and went to the school to keep her.
    From completely nomadic to settled nomadic, this is another new thing on the grassland. The establishment of a settlement in Sangke only began in October last year. In the past, herdsmen lived scattered on the grassland, one household at a time. Whether it was fighting against nature or resisting the encroachment of evil forces, their strength seemed even weaker than that of "small farmers." With the establishment of settlements, there are more people and more strength. The changes in people's lives and thoughts are also extremely rapid. Sangke Grassland is really a scene of thriving people and animals. Unfortunately, we were a step late. A few days ago, all 110,000 livestock and most of the male and female herders of the entire team had moved to the summer pasture. Only an auxiliary professional team composed of more than 200 laborers remained in the settlement, in addition to the old, the weak, and school-age children. We went to the tents to visit each household. The people at home were all at peace, making shoes, tanning leather, and grinding roasted noodles. Everyone was busy with production. It can be seen that these production activities in the settlement are indispensable "logistics" for the front line of production. Especially grinding roasted noodles, under the tent, groups of Tibetan women, talking and laughing, some burning firewood, some frying highland barley, some lined up and collectively laboring with small stone mills. This kind of happy collective labor is naturally the first time in the lives of herdsmen. In addition, we also saw that this "Tibetan village" has a professional sewing group. At the same time, we also went to see the nursing home in the "village."
    On the newly turned land around the "Tibetan village," the Sangke Team planted 200 mu of vegetables, 200 mu of feed, and 100 mu of rapeseed. These are all experimental in nature. Gradually moving from settlement to combining agriculture and animal husbandry, what a great progress this is. Although this is just the beginning, it is not difficult to imagine that it will have a magnificent future once the first step has been taken.
    The Master of Mankel
    In the northwest corner of Labrang Monastery, there is a place called Mankel. This is a Tibetan residential area, where people are mainly engaged in agriculture. After communization, this is a production work team of Labrang Commune. The entire team has only fifty-odd households, 177 people, and a total of 75 male and female laborers, excluding the elderly and children.
    Mankel is an agricultural area and has long been settled. The situation is better than Sangke. Everyone here lives in houses. We have been to several households to see, almost every household has bright windows and clean tables, and the ground is clean, the degree of cleanliness is rare even in mainland cities. It is said that the sanitation work in this Tibetan area has been year after year, and is a well-known sanitation model unit in Gannan. A woman named Zhuodai here has not only won awards for sanitation models at the county, state, and provincial levels, but also received the highest honor of going to Beijing to attend a meeting and meet Chairman Mao in the autumn of 1958. She is a beloved activist in the team and a good "Jia Ma" (cook) in the public canteen.
    This canteen in Mankel has four Jia Mas who cook meals for more than 100 people. The "menu" for each week is posted on the wall. There are 18 meals a week, and no two meals are the same. The monthly food cost is only six yuan per person. The food is well-prepared, the commune members are satisfied, and the enthusiasm for production is very high. Although participation in the canteen is voluntary, none of the fifty-odd households are willing to go home to eat on their own. The public canteen also plays a role in changing customs. For example, the Tibetans in this team have become accustomed to washing their hands before eating, and everyone has developed good hygiene habits.
    Farewell to Gannan, and its Dewulu, Sangke, and Mankel, places full of new things, how can we not think of the Party, think of the comrades who are working hard here in accordance with the Party's ethnic policies, how difficult a road they have traveled, planting the seeds of national unity and socialism on this ancient and vibrant land; in this way, a hardworking and simple nation that has long been imprisoned has finally taken firm steps towards a new life.

    德乌鲁
    本报记者　陈维仁
　　从兰州出发，乘汽车沿着蜿蜒的公路，越过林荫茂密的山岭，不到一天工夫就到了一个新兴的草原城市——甘南藏族自治州的首府德乌鲁市。德乌鲁，这个名字，人们是不甚熟悉的，它是个闪耀着黄金色的草原。新建的德乌鲁市有两个不相连的市区，一个叫合作（原名黑错），自治州的领导机关现在就驻在这里；一个叫夏河，就是有名的拉卜楞寺的所在地。这两个市区相距六十多公里，同一片片小块农业区和辽阔的大草原连结在一起。　　去年民主改革以前，广大的草原上，遍地是神山、神树，连严重破坏草山的地老鼠哈拉（即旱獭）都成了活佛的“化身”，不许“侵害”。寺院和部落的反动上层说有神的地方，不许拉电线，开水渠，修公路。科学工作者用显微镜研究土壤、地质构造，他们就造谣说，汉人把“山神”捆绑起来了，藏民就要倒霉了。他们欺骗造谣、挑拨离间，妄图以此维持住他们腐朽透顶的封建统治。但是，从民主改革到现在，仅仅一年，不光德乌鲁，整个甘南地区都发生了天翻地覆的变化。草原上各族人民改造自然创造新生活的热情奔放，势如滚滚的白龙江，几十万群众，踏遍了“神山”，找到了铁、铜、煤、锗、水晶等二百三十多处矿源。为发展草原上的生产提供了最好的条件。现在在合作的德乌铜矿上，就有几千工人在开采，其中光藏族工人就有五百多。从此，甘南藏族地区结束了她没有近代工业的历史。
    茁壮的新芽
    打碎了封建盖子，甘南的民族工业，像一颗茁壮的新芽，露出了地平线。以合作来说，水电厂、机械制配厂、奶粉厂、玻璃厂已经先后建立起来，其中甘南乳品厂是建立较早的一个。在访问德乌鲁时，它给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    这个乳品厂是目前国内最先进的大型乳品厂之一，除成品包装外，生产过程全部机械化和半自动化。1957年7月1日建成投入生产以来，它主要生产乳粉、黄油，但还先后试制成功过蛋粉、牛羊肉罐头、干酪素等十几种产品。它的“金牛牌”奶粉，1958年以来，就一直行销国外，不断受到好评。
    6月初，牧区产奶量刚开始进入旺季，在甘南，我们经常在公路上碰到厂里到各公社收奶站拉鲜奶的汽车。合作周围百里地界内的广大牧区都为乳品厂供应鲜奶，直接得到发展工业的益处。现在鲜奶的收购价每斤一角五分，牧民卖一百斤鲜奶可收入十五元。在过去，鲜奶由牧民自己处理，每百斤产酥油五斤，价值只六元。我们从调查材料上看到，光乳品厂开工生产的当年，夏河等六个地区因出售鲜奶就增加收入十三万多元。阿木去乎部落有一户牧民，售奶五月，就从有两条牛到有三条牛。
    在一间简朴的办公室里，热情的厂长同我们谈了乳品厂短短的发展史。当他把话题转到厂里的十几位藏族工人的时候，我们却更深切地感到发展牧区的民族工业有着远比增加经济收入更深远的意义。这就是历史上第一次在藏族人民中产生了近代工人阶级。去年6、7月间，草原上的反动牧主、头人和宗教上层公开搞叛乱，反对共产党、反对合作化和社会主义的时候，厂里的藏族工人就坚定地站起来维护真理、进步，站在社会主义这一边，没日没夜地同全厂工人一起站岗放哨，保卫工厂，并自告奋勇地为追歼叛匪的部队带路。几年来，他们从自己的亲身经历中深深地懂得：合作化和社会主义是各族人民共同幸福繁荣的道路，保卫它就是保卫真理，坚持进步。
    桑科滩上藏民村
    在拉卜楞南边不远的地方，四面草山环抱有一块土质肥美而又广阔的草滩，这就是有名的桑科滩。去年公社化以后，桑科滩拉卜楞公社的一个生产大队，现在人们熟悉地把这个大队叫做桑科大队。
    桑科大队的草山南北长达一百华里，东西宽六、七十华里。全队五百十七户，除两户回民外，全是藏民，人口二千二百一十人，其中有男女劳力一千二百三十七个。这同内地的绝大多数地区比起来，真可算是幅员广大、人烟稀少的地方了。使我们感到新奇的，是古老的桑科滩上，第一次出现了历史上从来没有过的“藏民村”。
    我们从拉卜楞进入桑科不远，远远就看到一片黑压压的“房屋”，看得出，周围都是新翻的处女地。走近了，我们才发现一大片“房屋”原来都是牧民的帐篷组成的。在别的地方也看到过帐篷，但那都是一家一户，在广阔无垠的草原上，就像海洋里的孤帆。这里却大不相同，与其说像村落，倒不如说像古典小说里描写的军营。营地上帐篷一座座紧相连接，人们鸡犬之声相闻，彼此亲如一家。我们去的那天正是星期天，藏民的孩子们都没有上学，一到“村”边，孩子们就包围上来。我们虽然语言不通，看到孩子们天真稚气的笑容，一股暖流立即通过全身。桑科小学有学生三百多人，五位教员，汉民四人，藏民一人，都能用藏语教学。他们同学生和孩子们的家长建立了亲密的关系。不久前，家长们听说一位汉族教员要调动工作，就哭着到学校里挽留她。
    从完全游牧到定居游牧，这是草原上的又一桩新事物。桑科建立定居点，是去年10月才开始的。过去牧民分散地生活在草原上，一家一户，无论向自然作斗争，或抵制恶势力的侵害，力量显得比“小农”还要单薄。建立了定居点，人多力量大，人们从生活到思想上的变化，也都极为迅速。桑科滩上真是一片人畜兴旺的景象。可惜，我们来迟了一步，几天以前，全队的十一万头牲畜和多数男女牧民，都转移到夏季牧场去了。留在定居点上的，除了老弱和上学的儿童，只有一个二百多劳力组成的副业专业队。我们到帐篷去挨户串门，在家的人都各安生理，做鞋的，硝皮的，磨炒面的，大家都在忙生产。看得出，定居点上的这些生产活动，都是生产前线所不可或缺的“后勤”。特别是磨炒面，帐篷下一群群藏民妇女，说说笑笑，有的烧火，有的炒青稞，有的排成一排用手摇着小石磨集体劳动。这种愉快的集体劳动，在牧民生活中自然是第一次。另外，我们还看到这个“藏民村”有一个专业缝纫组。同时，也曾去看过“村”里的敬老院。
    在“藏民村”周围新翻的土地上，桑科大队种了二百亩菜蔬，二百亩饲料，一百亩油菜籽。这些都带试验性质。从定居逐步走向农牧结合，这又是多么大的一个进步，虽然这仅仅才是开始，但已经迈开了第一步，就不难想像它会有一个绚丽的前程。
    满客尔的主人
    在拉卜楞寺院的西北角上，有个叫做满客尔的地方。这是一个藏民聚居区，人们主要从事农业。公社化以后，这里是拉卜楞公社的一个生产作业队，全队只有五十几户人家，一百七十七人，除了老人和孩子，共有男女劳动力七十五个。
    满客尔是个农业区，早就定居了。情况比桑科就更好一些。这里家家都住的是房子。我们去过好几户人家看过，几乎户户明窗净几，地上干干净净，其整洁的程度，在内地城市里也是少见的。据说，这个藏民区的卫生工作已经常年如一日，在甘南是有名的卫生模范单位。这里一位名叫卓代的妇女，不仅得过县里、州里、省里的卫生模范的奖励，1958年秋天还得到上北京参加会议见毛主席的最高荣誉。她在队里是一位受人爱戴的积极分子，是公共食堂的一个好“家麻”（炊事员）。
    满客尔这个食堂，有四个家麻做一百多人的饭食，墙上贴着每周的“食谱”，一周十八餐，餐餐不重样。每月伙食费每人才六元。伙食办得好，社员满意，生产劲头很足。尽管参加食堂是自愿的，五十几户人家，却没有一户愿意回家自己吃的。公共食堂还起了移风易俗的作用。比如这个队的藏民都已习惯洗手吃饭，人人都养成了良好的卫生习惯。
    告别了甘南，以及它的德乌鲁、桑科和满客尔这样一些充满新生事物的地方，怎么不叫我们想到党，想到在这里按照党的民族政策辛勤工作的同志，是他们走过了多么艰难的道路，把民族团结的、社会主义的种子种在这块古老而又充满青春活力的土地上；就这样，一个长期被禁锢着的勤劳纯朴的民族，终于迈开了雄健的步伐走向新生。（附图片）
