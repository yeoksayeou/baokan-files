Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 4th: TASS reports from Moscow: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union held a reception in the Kremlin on September 3 for graduates of Soviet Armed Forces Military Academies.

Those attending the reception included Soviet party and government leaders Aristov, Brezhnev, Kirichenko, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Suslov, Khrushchev, Kosygin, and others.

Also attending the reception were Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky and Soviet Marshals of the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the government, he extended warm congratulations to the graduates. He also wholeheartedly congratulated the officers from people's democratic countries who attended the reception after graduating from military academies, and wished them great achievements in strengthening the armies of the countries of the socialist camp.

Khrushchev told the graduates that you are graduating and participating in practical work at such a wonderful moment: that is, the entire Soviet people are enthusiastically solving the historic tasks put forward by the 21st Party Congress.

He said that the resolutions of the June Plenum of the Party Central Committee are of great significance for completing the grand plans formulated by the 21st Party Congress. Further accelerating technological progress is a fundamental link in solving the task of creating the material and technical base of communism. We have placed our bet on this horse in the economic competition with the United States. There is no doubt that due to the continuous improvement of technology and the promotion of comprehensive mechanization and automation in all sectors of production, we will be able to win this competition within the scheduled time or even ahead of schedule.

Khrushchev pointed out that the high speed and outstanding achievements of the Soviet state in developing its economy and improving its science and culture have surprised representatives of the capitalist world, especially those who have the opportunity to see the reality of the Soviet Union with their own eyes.

As for the Soviet people, we are satisfied that the achievements of Soviet communist construction not only make our friends reasonably proud but also force the arrogant militarists of the West to act more calmly.

He said, we firmly believe that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and we are doing everything possible to develop cooperation between countries to rid mankind of the threat of a new world war.

Khrushchev pointed out that the efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in this regard have been supported by the world's peace forces, and good results have been continuously achieved. International relations are somewhat warmer, and the ice of the "Cold War" is beginning to melt. The upcoming mutual visits of the heads of the Soviet and American governments provide great possibilities for further easing world tensions and improving Soviet-American relations. He said that we will strive to make this visit bring as much benefit as possible to the people of our country and to the cause of strengthening peace and international cooperation.

Khrushchev said, but it must be taken into account that to ensure the security of the motherland, it is not enough to have only a peaceful, even the most active, foreign policy. As long as no international agreement on disarmament has been reached, it is necessary to strengthen national defense with all our strength to achieve this goal.

He said, we all see that the international status of the Soviet Union is constantly improving. Due to the establishment and consolidation of the world socialist system, our country is no longer in the encirclement of capitalism. The forces of peace and democracy are growing stronger and their activities are becoming increasingly active. We have every reason to say that as the Soviet Union advances towards communism and the entire socialist camp becomes more consolidated, a real possibility will arise to eliminate war as a means of resolving international disputes.

Khrushchev continued, however, all this should not make us relax our attention to the issues of strengthening national security and improving the power of the armed forces. We cannot fail to take into account that there are aggressive forces in the world carrying out activities, because there is soil that breeds these forces—imperialism. We also cannot turn a blind eye to some unpleasant things, such as the continuous arms race, the large number of military bases around the Soviet Union, and the fact that some people are giving atomic weapons to West German revanchists.

Under these circumstances, we must strengthen the armed forces with all our strength and maintain their high state of combat readiness. The Communist Party and the Soviet government constantly care about strengthening national defense and take all necessary measures to keep the armed forces at a level that meets modern requirements.

He said, we are constantly strengthening the army and navy and equipping them with the latest technology. The mission of our armed forces is to guarantee the peaceful and constructive labor of the Soviet people who are building communism. It is a great honor for every Soviet soldier to live up to this noble mission.

Khrushchev said, we are building communism in the big family of socialist countries. All countries in the socialist camp have formed a unified and indestructible team with us. Our countries are also working together to carry out the task of strengthening national defense to prevent aggression by imperialist aggressors. Strengthening the solidarity with the armies of fraternal countries and being loyal to the internationalist duty—this is the sacred obligation of all our military personnel.

He also said that the honorable duty of Soviet soldiers is: to constantly strengthen their ties with the people, always maintain the lofty prestige of our army in the hearts of the working people, and gloriously repay the lofty trust of the working people with the spirit of loyalty to the motherland.

He pointed out that the armed forces are able to victoriously complete their historical mission because the Communist Party is its victorious organizer and inspirer. The resolutions of the October 1957 Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as the concerted efforts subsequently made by commanders and political workers at all levels to implement these resolutions, have had a positive impact on the combat readiness of the armed forces. In the future, we should also unswervingly strengthen the Party's influence on all aspects of the army and navy life and strive to improve the work of Party organizations.

Khrushchev said that in solving the great and glorious tasks of the Soviet army and navy, the officer cadre plays a paramount role. The Soviet Communist Party and the government have entrusted them with the full responsibility of training and educating all military personnel. It is very clear that in order to complete these major tasks, commanders and leaders must be good at relying on Party organizations, as well as maintaining close ties with Party members and all officers and soldiers.

The high ideological consciousness of Soviet soldiers, their confidence in the justice and inevitable victory of our cause—this is a powerful weapon that makes our army a great and invincible force. Doing a good job in ideological education is a decisive condition for further enhancing the power of the armed forces.

Khrushchev said that the era we live in is an era of tremendous technological development, including the tremendous development of the tools of armed struggle. Under these circumstances, more than ever before, an officer is required to constantly improve his knowledge. Otherwise, even an excellent graduation certificate will not prevent him from experiencing setbacks in his work. Officers must be proficient in rapidly developing technology. Moreover, he should not be a narrow expert in a certain military department, but should be a person with broad vision. They must creatively apply the knowledge they have learned in the academy, so they must have constant initiative and creativity.

Khrushchev encouraged them to establish lofty prestige among their subordinates after becoming commanders. He said that the prestige of a commander is first established by himself. To do this, he should be proficient in his business, have perfect moral character, care for his subordinates, and maintain close contact with the soldiers.

Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky also spoke at the reception. He said that in the process of study, the students mainly studied the new problems arising from the use of various new military rocket technologies and weapons to equip the army and navy. To this end, higher military schools have done a great deal of work in improving the students' theoretical knowledge and cultivation, and paid special attention to the study of mathematical and physical sciences. Military academies and higher military schools have done a great deal of work in making the students' practical cultivation close to the modernization requirements and needs of the army.

Malinovsky said that thanks to the constant care of the Central Committee and the Soviet government, the Soviet armed forces have the latest equipment, as well as well-trained officers and soldiers, and it has sufficient strength to give a devastating blow to any aggressor who dares to disrupt the peaceful life of the Soviet people.

    赫鲁晓夫对军事学院毕业生讲话
    和平力量日强国际关系有些转暖
    侵略势力仍在活动必须加强国防
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团和苏联部长会议，9月3日在克里姆林宫为苏联武装部队军事学院毕业生举行招待会。
    出席招待会的有：苏联党政领导人阿里斯托夫、勃列日涅夫、基里钦科、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、柯西金等。
    出席招待会的还有：苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅和苏联元帅们。
    赫鲁晓夫在会上讲了话。他代表党中央和政府向毕业生表示热烈祝贺。他还衷心祝贺出席招待会的从军事学院毕业的人民民主国家的军官，祝他们在加强社会主义阵营各国军队方面取得巨大成就。
    赫鲁晓夫对毕业生们说，你们是在这样一个美好的时刻毕业并参加实际工作的：这就是，全体苏联人民正以奋发的热情解决着第二十一次党代表大会提出的历史性任务。
    他说，党中央六月全会的决议对完成第二十一次党代表大会所制定的宏伟的计划具有重大意义。进一步加速技术进步是解决创造共产主义物质技术基础这个任务的基本环节。在同美国的经济竞赛中，我们就在这匹马上下了赌注。毫无疑问，由于不断改进技术、在生产的一切部门中推广全盘机械化和自动化，我们能够在预定的时期内或者能够提前赢得这场竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏维埃国家在发展经济和提高科学文化方面所达到的高速度和所取得的卓越成绩，使资本主义世界的代表也感到惊讶，特别使那些有机会亲眼看到苏联现实的人感到惊讶。
    至于苏联人，我们感到满意的是，苏联共产主义建设的成就既使我们的朋友们感到合理的骄傲，同时也迫使西方狂妄的军国主义分子不得不更冷静地行事。
    他说，我们坚信，不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处，我们这方面正尽一切可能来发展国与国之间的合作，使人类摆脱新的世界大战的威胁。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联同其他社会主义国家在这方面的努力得到了世界和平力量的支持，不断取得良好的成果。国际关系有些转暖了，“冷战”的冰块在开始融化。苏联和美国政府首脑最近即将进行的互相访问，为进一步缓和世界紧张局势和改善苏美关系提供巨大的可能性。他说，我们将努力使这次访问给我们国家的人民，给加强和平和国际合作的事业带来尽可能多的好处。
    赫鲁晓夫说，但是必须考虑到，要想保障祖国的安全，仅仅有和平的、甚至是最积极的外交政策是不够的。只要还没有达成关于裁军的国际协议，要做到这一步就必须全力加强国防力量。
    他说，我们大家都看到，苏联的国际地位正在不断改善。由于世界社会主义体系的建立和巩固，我国不再处于资本主义的包围中了。和平民主力量一天天壮大，活动日益积极。我们有充分理由说，随着苏联向共产主义的推进和整个社会主义阵营的更加巩固，将会产生现实的可能来消灭作为解决国际争端手段的战争。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，然而，这一切不应当使我们放松对加强国家安全和提高武装部队威力这些问题的注意。不能不考虑到，世界上有侵略势力在进行活动，因为存在着滋生这些势力的土壤——帝国主义。也不能对一些不愉快的事不闻不问，譬如，军备竞赛在不断进行，苏联周围有大量军事基地，有人给西德复仇主义分子以原子武器。
    在这种情况下，我们必须全力加强武装部队，保持它们高度的战斗准备。共产党和苏联政府经常关心加强国防力量，采取一切必要措施使武装部队保持符合现代要求的水平。
    他说，我们不断加强陆海军和配备给它们最新式的技术装备。我国武装部队的使命是，保证正在建设共产主义的苏联人民的和平的建设性劳动。不辜负这个崇高的使命，是每个苏联军人莫大的荣誉。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们在社会主义国家的大家庭中建设共产主义。社会主义阵营的所有国家同我们结成了统一的不可摧毁的队伍。我们这些国家在执行加强国防以防帝国主义侵略者进攻这个任务方面也是同心协力的。加强同兄弟国家军队的团结，忠于国际主义的天职——这是我军全体人员的神圣义务。
    他又说，苏联军人荣誉的天职是：不断加强自己同人民的联系，始终保持我军在劳动人民心目中的崇高威望，以忠于祖国的精神光荣地报答劳动人民的崇高信任。
    他指出，武装部队之所以能够无往不胜地完成它的历史使命，是因为共产党是它的胜利的组织者和鼓舞者。苏共中央1957年10月全会的决议，以及各级指挥员和政治工作人员随后为实现这些决议所作的协同一致的努力，对武装部队的战斗准备状态产生了良好的影响。今后也应当坚定不移地加强党对陆海军生活的各个方面的影响，竭力改善党组织的工作。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在解决苏联陆海军的巨大和光荣的任务中，军官干部起着头等重要的作用。苏联共产党和政府把训练和教育全军人员的全部责任交给了他们。十分清楚，指挥员和首长要完成这些重大的任务，就必须善于依靠党组织，以及密切同党员群众和全军官兵的联系。
    苏联军人高度的思想觉悟、他们对我们事业的正义性和必然获胜的信心——这就是使我们军队具有伟大和不可战胜的力量强有力的武器。很好地对人做思想教育工作，是进一步提高武装力量的威力的决定性条件。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们生活的时代是技术有着巨大发展的时代，其中武装斗争的工具也有巨大的发展。在这种情况下，比过去任何时候都更要求一个军官不断地使自己的知识完善起来。否则，成绩优异的毕业证书也无法使他在工作中不受挫折。军官必须精通迅速发展的技术。而且，他不应该只是某一军事部门的狭隘的专家，而应该是眼界宽广的人。他们要创造性地运用在学院中学到的知识，因此，必须有经常的积极性和首创精神。
    赫鲁晓夫勉励他们在成为指挥员之后，要在下级中间树立崇高的威信。他说，指挥员的威望首先是由他自己树立起来的。要做到这一点应该精通本行业务，具有完美的品德，关心下级，和士兵群众经常保持紧密的联系。
    苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅也在招待会上讲了话。他说，在学习过程中，学员们主要是研究由于用各种新式军用火箭技术和武器装备陆海军而产生的新问题。为此，高等军事学校在提高学员的理论知识修养方面作了巨大的工作，特别注意数理学科的研究。军事学院和高等军事学校在使学员实际修养接近军队的现代化要求和需要方面作了巨大的工作。
    马利诺夫斯基说，由于中央委员会和苏联政府经常的关怀，苏联武装部队拥有最新式的装备，以及受过良好训练的军官和士兵，它有充足的力量给予胆敢破坏苏联人民和平生活的任何侵略者以歼灭性的回击。
