Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru presented a white paper to the Indian Parliament on September 7th, which included Prime Minister Nehru's letter to Premier Zhou Enlai on March 22nd of this year regarding the Sino-Indian border issue. Premier Zhou Enlai replied to Prime Minister Nehru in a letter dated September 8th. The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru is as follows: To His Excellency Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of the Republic of India, New Delhi, Dear Prime Minister:

I have carefully read Your Excellency's letter of March 22, 1959. From the letter, I have found that the two governments have fundamental differences in their positions on the Sino-Indian border issue. This surprised me a bit, and it also made me take a longer time to consider how to respond to your letter.

The Sino-Indian border issue is a complex issue left over by history. When dealing with this issue, one cannot but first consider the historical background of Britain's aggression against China during its rule over India. From a very early time, Britain harbored aggressive ambitions towards China's Tibet region. Britain continuously instigated Tibet to secede from China, attempting to place a nominally independent Tibet under British control. After this conspiracy failed, Britain exerted various pressures on China, demanding that Tibet be designated as a British sphere of influence, while China retained so-called suzerainty over Tibet. At the same time, Britain used India as a base to carry out extensive territorial expansion into China's Tibet region and even the Xinjiang region. All of this is the fundamental reason why the Sino-Indian border issue has long been disputed and unresolved.

Both China and India are countries that have suffered from imperialist aggression for a long time. This shared experience should naturally lead China and India to have a consistent view of the above-mentioned historical background, and to adopt a mutually sympathetic, understanding, and fair and reasonable attitude in handling the border issue between the two countries. The Chinese government originally believed that the Indian government would adopt this attitude. However, to the surprise of the Chinese government, the Indian government demanded that the Chinese government formally recognize the situation created by Britain's aggressive policy towards China's Tibet region as the basis for resolving the Sino-Indian border issue. More seriously, the Indian government has exerted various pressures on the Chinese government, and even resorted to force, to support this demand. This cannot but make the Chinese government feel deeply regretful.

The Chinese government has always maintained that China and India should consider the historical background and the current actual situation, and comprehensively resolve the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultations, with preparation and in a step-by-step manner, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Before this, as a temporary measure, both sides should maintain the long-standing state of the border, without unilaterally changing this state through action, let alone the use of force; for some disputes, partial and temporary agreements can also be reached through negotiations to ensure peace on the border and maintain the friendship between the two countries. This is precisely the basic idea I expressed in my letter to you on January 23, 1959. The Chinese government still believes that this is the path that our two countries should follow to resolve the border issue. From Your Excellency's letter of March 22, 1959, it seems that you do not completely oppose this principle.

Now, I would like to further explain the Chinese government's position on the various issues raised in Your Excellency's letter and in light of the recent situation on the Sino-Indian border.

1. In my letter to Your Excellency on January 23, 1959, I pointed out that the Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated. Your Excellency disagreed with this in your letter of March 22, 1959, and tried to prove that the vast majority of the Sino-Indian border was confirmed by specialized international agreements between the past Indian government and the Chinese Central Government. In order to prove that the Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated, I am willing to provide the following facts:

(1) Regarding the section of the border between China's Xinjiang region and Tibet region and Ladakh.

In 1842, a treaty was indeed concluded between the local authorities of China's Tibet region on the one hand and the Kashmir authorities on the other. However, the Chinese Central Government did not send anyone to participate in the signing of this treaty at that time, nor did it approve the treaty afterwards. Moreover, this treaty only generally mentioned that Ladakh and Tibet would abide by their respective borders, without specifically stipulating and explaining the location of this border. Obviously, this treaty cannot be used to prove that both parties formally demarcated this border, let alone to demand that the Chinese government accept the Indian government's unilateral claim to this border. As for the Chinese government officials' statement to the British representative in 1847 that this border was clear, this can only show that the Chinese government at that time had its own clear view of this border, but it cannot be used as proof that the border between the two sides has been formally demarcated. In fact, as late as 1899, the British government had suggested formally demarcating this border with the Chinese government, but the Chinese government did not agree. On August 28th of this year, Your Excellency also said in the Indian People's Assembly: "This is the border between the old Kashmir state and Tibet and Chinese Turkestan. No one has demarcated this border." From this, it can be seen that this border has never been demarcated. However, due to historical traditions, there is indeed a customary line between China and Ladakh. Chinese-published maps have always marked the border between China and Ladakh according to this line. The map of "Punjab, the Western Himalayas, and the Part Bordering Tibet" drawn by the British John Walker under the order of the Board of Directors of the East India Company (this map is attached to the book "Ladakh" written by the British Major Alexander Cunningham and published in 1854) is quite close to the Chinese-published maps in its marking of this border. Later, British and Indian maps incorporated large areas of Chinese territory into Ladakh, which is both without legal basis and does not conform to the actual situation of administrative jurisdiction that has always existed on both sides.

(2) Regarding the section of the border between China's Ali region in Tibet and India.

From your letter, it can be seen that you also agree that this section of the border has not been formally demarcated by the two countries. Not only that, in fact, there have been historical disputes between the two sides over the ownership of many places in this area. For example, the Sang and Congsha areas southwest of Zhabran Zong in Tibet have always belonged to China. Three or forty years ago, they were gradually occupied by the British. The local authorities of Tibet in China negotiated with the British several times, but to no avail, and it became a historical issue.

(3) Regarding the Sino-Indian border east of Bhutan.

The Indian government insists that this border has been clearly demarcated long ago. The basis for this claim is that at the Simla Conference in 1913-1914, representatives from the Chinese government, the Tibetan local authorities, and the British government jointly demarcated the so-called McMahon Line. I have repeatedly explained to Your Excellency that the Simla Conference was an important step in Britain's conspiracy to separate Tibet from China. At this conference, the boundary lines of so-called Inner Tibet and Outer Tibet and the boundary line between Tibet and other parts of China were discussed. Contrary to what you said in your letter, the so-called McMahon Line was never discussed at the Simla Conference. Instead, the representatives of Britain and the Tibetan local authorities secretly exchanged letters in Delhi on March 24, 1914, before the signing of the Simla Treaty. This boundary line was later marked on the attached map of the Simla Treaty as part of the boundary line between Tibet and other parts of China. The so-called McMahon Line is a product of Britain's aggressive policy towards China's Tibet region and has never been recognized by any central government of China, so it is certainly illegal. As for the Simla Treaty, the representative of the Chinese Central Government did not formally sign it at that time, which is clearly stated in the treaty. For quite a long time after the secret exchange of letters between Britain and the Tibetan local authorities, Britain did not dare to publish the relevant documents, nor did it dare to change the traditional way of drawing this section of the border on the map. This illegal boundary line has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people. Even the Tibetan local authorities later expressed dissatisfaction with this boundary line and sent a telegram to Your Excellency after India's independence in 1947, demanding that India return all the territory of China's Tibet region south of this illegal boundary line. This territory is equivalent to China's Zhejiang Province, with an area of 90,000 square kilometers. Prime Minister, how can China agree to be forced to accept such an illegal boundary line that humiliates the country, sells out its territory, and this territory is so large? The way China's traditionally published maps draw the Sino-Indian border east of Bhutan truthfully reflects the actual situation of the traditional border before the so-called McMahon Line was drawn. The "Tibet and Neighboring Countries" map published by the Indian Survey Bureau in 1917 and the attached map of the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1929 are consistent with the Chinese-published maps in the way they draw this section of the border. Indian troops only advanced on a large scale into the area south of the so-called McMahon Line around 1951, before and after the peaceful liberation of China's Tibet region. Therefore, the claim that this section of the border has been clearly demarcated long ago is obviously untenable.

Your Excellency also mentioned the border between China and Sikkim in your letter. This issue, like the border between China and Bhutan, is not within the scope of our current discussion. However, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that China is willing to live in peace and friendship with Sikkim and Bhutan, and to respect their legitimate relations with India.

From the above, it can be seen that the way China's traditionally published maps draw the Sino-Indian border is not without basis, and the way British and Indian published maps draw the Sino-Indian border was also roughly the same as the Chinese-published maps at the beginning. In fact, it is not the Chinese-published maps, but the British and Indian published maps that have later made unilateral modifications to the way the Sino-Indian border is drawn. Even so, since China and India have not yet demarcated the border through friendly negotiations and joint surveys, China has not demanded that India revise its maps. In 1954, I also explained to Your Excellency for the same reason that it is not appropriate for the Chinese government to revise old maps at present. However, some people in India have been making a big noise about Chinese-published maps, trying to create public opinion pressure to force China to accept India's unilateral claims on the Sino-Indian border. Needless to say, this approach is both unwise and undesirable.

2. As mentioned above, the Chinese government has consistently followed a very clear policy on the Sino-Indian border issue. On the one hand, it affirms the fact that the entire Sino-Indian border has not been demarcated. On the other hand, it faces reality and, in particular, takes into account the friendly relations between China and India, actively seeking a fair and reasonable solution for both parties, and never unilaterally changes the long-standing state of the border between the two countries before the border issue is resolved.

In the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border, as I have said before, China will never recognize the so-called McMahon Line, but the Chinese army has never crossed this line. This is to maintain peace on the border, which is conducive to negotiations and solutions to the border issue, and does not mean in any way that the Chinese government has recognized this line. In view of the fact that Your Excellency obviously has a misunderstanding of what I have explained to Your Excellency in my two recent letters, I think it is necessary to make the above explanation clearly again.

In the western section of the Sino-Indian border, China strictly abides by the traditional customary line. The Chinese government has always dealt with incidents of Indian troops repeatedly invading or occupying Chinese territory in a friendly manner and in different ways. For example, regarding the issue of Indian troops and administrative personnel invading Wure, the Chinese government strives to negotiate with the Indian government to resolve the issue and avoid conflict. For Indian troops who invaded the southwestern Xinjiang region of China and the Pangong Lake area of ​​the Tibet region of China, the Chinese border troops, after disarming them in accordance with international practice, adopted a reasoned attitude, demanding that they leave the country, and returning their weapons. Regarding the areas of Shipchi Pass, Barigas, Sang, Congsha, Poling Sanduo, Juwa, Qure, Xiangzha, and Labudi that Indian troops have successively occupied, the Chinese government has always conducted thorough and detailed investigations after discovering these situations, instead of immediately and excitedly lodging accusations against the Indian government. These measures prove that the Chinese government is doing its best to safeguard Sino-Indian friendship.

Despite all the above-mentioned border incidents caused by Indian troops crossing the border, the atmosphere on the Sino-Indian border was generally good until the beginning of this year. On the entire undetermined Sino-Indian border of about 2,000 kilometers, there have never been military conflict incidents. This fact itself powerfully proves that before the border between the two countries has been demarcated, as long as both sides adopt a friendly and reasonable attitude, it is possible to maintain peace and harmony in the border area without tension.

3. However, since the Tibetan rebellion occurred, the border situation has become increasingly tense due to reasons that cannot be blamed on the Chinese side. After a large number of Tibetan rebels fled to India, the Indian army immediately advanced step by step in the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border, not only unilaterally changing the long-standing state of the border between the two countries, crossing the so-called McMahon Line marked on the attached map of the secret exchange of letters between the British and Tibetan local authorities, but also crossing the boundary line marked on the currently published maps of India, which is said to be the so-called McMahon Line, but which is actually deeper into Chinese territory than the so-called McMahon Line in many places. Indian troops occupied Langju, invaded Yaqieer, and still occupy Chinese territory such as Shazhe, Jianzema Ni, and Tamadun, harboring armed Tibetan bandits in this area. Indian planes have also repeatedly violated China's airspace on the Sino-Indian border. What is particularly regrettable is that not long ago, the Indian troops who illegally occupied Langju actually launched an armed attack on the Chinese border troops stationed in Majidun, forcing the Chinese border troops to fight back in self-defense. This is the first armed conflict incident that has occurred on the Sino-Indian border. From the above, it can be seen that the recent tension on the Sino-Indian border is due to provocations by Indian troops crossing the border and should be the sole responsibility of the Indian side. However, the Indian government has instead made various unfounded accusations against the Chinese government, shouting that China has invaded India, and describing the self-defense actions of the Chinese border troops in the Majidun area as armed provocations. Many Indian politicians and propaganda organs have taken the opportunity to spread a large amount of anti-China rhetoric, and even openly advocated taking larger-scale provocative actions such as bombing Chinese territory. This has set off the second anti-China movement in India in the past six months. India does not recognize the fact that the Sino-Indian border has not been demarcated, and has intensified its pressure on China in terms of military, diplomacy, and public opinion, which cannot but make people suspect that India's attempt is to impose its unilateral claims on the border issue on the Chinese side. It must be pointed out that this attempt can never be realized, and doing so will only damage the friendship between the two countries and make the border issue more complicated and more difficult to resolve.

4. The friendly relations between China and India are built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government has always believed that all differences between our two countries must and can be resolved through peaceful consultations, and that the friendly relations between the two countries should not be affected. China regards the southwestern border as a border of peace and friendship. I can assure Your Excellency that in recent months, the Chinese government has sent guard troops to be stationed in the southeastern part of China's Tibet region only to prevent the remaining armed Tibetan bandits from entering and leaving the border and carrying out harassment. Doing so is obviously conducive to ensuring peace and tranquility on the border and will not in any way pose a threat to India. Your Excellency is one of the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, has made important contributions to consolidating and developing Sino-Indian friendship, and has often emphasized the importance of Sino-Indian friendship. The Chinese government and the Chinese people are deeply impressed by this. Therefore, I have systematically explained the entire situation of the Sino-Indian border to Your Excellency. I hope that Your Excellency and the Indian government will, in accordance with the requirements of the Chinese government, immediately take measures to withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who have crossed the border and restore the long-standing state of the border between the two countries. In this way, the temporary tension on the Sino-Indian border will immediately ease, the cloud covering the relations between the two countries will quickly dissipate, friends who care about Sino-Indian friendly relations will feel relieved, and those who provoke Sino-Indian relations and create tension will be struck.

With cordial respect.

Zhou Enlai
Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China

    周恩来总理写信答复尼赫鲁总理
    阐明我国对中印边界问题和边境局势的立场
    中印边界从未正式划定。　中国政府一贯主张双方应根据五项原则通过友好协商全面解决边界问题。　中国绝不承认所谓麦克马洪线，但是为了维持边境的和睦，中国军队从未越过这条线。　最近中印边境出现的紧张局势，都是由于印军越境挑衅造成的，应该由印度方面负完全责任。　希望印度政府立即采取措施撤回越境印军和行政人员，恢复两国边界久已存在的状况。
    新华社9日讯　印度总理尼赫鲁在9月7日向印度议会提出了白皮书，其中公布了尼赫鲁总理在今年3月22日关于中印边界问题给周恩来总理的信。周恩来总理已在9月8日写信答复尼赫鲁总理。周恩来总理给尼赫鲁总理的信全文如下：新德里印度共和国总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生阁下亲爱的总理先生：
    我已经仔细地阅读了阁下1959年3月22日的来信。从来信中我发现，在中印边界问题上，两国政府的立场有着基本的分歧。这使我有点惊异，同时也使我不得不用较长的时间来考虑如何答复你的来信。
    中印边界问题是历史遗留下来的复杂问题。处理这个问题的时候，不能不首先考虑到英国在统治印度的时期对中国进行侵略的历史背景。从很早的时候起，英国就抱着对中国西藏地方的侵略野心。英国曾经不断唆使西藏脱离中国，企图把一个名义上独立的西藏置于英国的控制之下。在这个阴谋不能得逞以后，英国又对中国施加种种压力，要求把西藏划为英国的势力范围，而让中国保留所谓对西藏的宗主权。与此同时，英国还以印度为基地，广泛地向中国的西藏地方甚至新疆地方进行领土扩张。这一切就是中印边界问题长期存在纠纷、悬而不决的基本原因。
    中印两国都是长期遭受帝国主义侵略的国家。这种共同的遭遇，本来应该很自然地使中印两国对上述的历史背景抱有一致的看法，并且采取互相同情、互相谅解和公平合理的态度，处理两国的边界问题。中国政府原来以为，印度政府是会采取这种态度的。但是，出乎中国政府的意料之外，印度政府竟要求中国政府正式承认英国对中国西藏地方执行侵略政策所造成的局面，作为解决中印边界问题的根据。更严重的是，印度政府对中国政府施加种种压力，甚至不惜使用武力，来支持这种要求。这不能不使中国政府感到深切的遗憾。
    中国政府一贯主张，中印双方应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，有准备有步骤地通过友好协商，全面解决两国边界问题。在此以前，作为临时性的措施，双方应该维持边界久已存在的状况，而不以片面行动、更不应该使用武力改变这种状况；对于一部分争执，还可以通过谈判达成局部性和临时性的协议，以保证边界的安宁，维护两国的友谊。这正是我在1959年1月23日给你的信中所表达的基本思想。中国政府仍然认为，这是我们两国解决边界问题所应该遵循的途径。从1959年3月22日阁下来信看来，似乎你并不完全反对这一原则。
    现在，我愿意就阁下来信中所提出的各项问题并且结合最近中印边境的形势，进一步说明中国政府的立场。
    一、我在1959年1月23日给阁下的信中曾经指出，中印边界是从未经过正式划定的。阁下在1959年3月22日的来信中对此表示不能同意，并且力图证明中印边界的绝大部分是由过去的印度政府和中国中央政府之间的专门的国际协定所确认的。为了证明中印边界从未正式划定，我愿意提供以下的事实：
    （1）关于中国的新疆地方和西藏地方同拉达克接壤的一段边界。
    1842年，以中国的西藏地方当局为一方和克什米尔当局为另一方，的确订立过一个和约。但是，当时中国的中央政府并没有派人参加这个条约的签订，事后也没有批准这个条约。而且这个条约也只是泛泛地提到拉达克和西藏将恪守各自的疆界，没有具体规定和说明这段边界的位置。显然，不能用这个条约来证明双方正式划定了这段边界，更不能据此要求中国政府接受印度政府对这段边界的片面主张。至于1847年中国政府官员向英国代表表示这段边界是明确的，这也只能说明当时的中国政府对于这段边界有它自己的明确的看法，而并不能作为双方边界已经正式划定的证明。事实上，直到1899年英国政府还曾经建议同中国政府正式划定这段边界，但是，中国政府没有同意。今年8月28日，阁下在印度人民院也说过：“这是旧克什米尔邦同西藏和中国土耳其斯坦的疆界。没有谁划定过这条疆界。”由此可见，这段边界是始终没有划定的。但是，中国和拉达克之间，由于历史的传统，确实存在着一条习惯线，中国出版的地图历来都是按照这条线标明中国和拉达克之间的边界的。英国人约翰·瓦克根据东印度公司董事会的命令所画的“旁遮普、喜马拉雅山西部以及同西藏接壤部分”图（这个地图附在1854年出版的英国人亚历山大·克宁汉少校所著的“拉达克”一书之内），对这段边界的标法，同中国出版的地图相当接近。后来英国和印度的地图把大片中国领土划入拉达克境内，这是既无法律根据、又不符合双方历来行政管辖的实际情况的。
      （2）关于中国西藏的阿里地区同印度接壤的一段边界。
    从你的来信看出，你也同意这段边界是未经两国正式划定的。不仅如此，事实上双方对于这一地区许多地点的归属，历史上就有争执。例如在西藏札布兰宗西南的桑、葱莎地区历来属于中国，三、四十年以前逐渐为英国人所侵占，中国西藏地方当局几度同英国交涉，均无结果，成为历史悬案。
      （3）关于不丹以东的中印边界。
    印度政府坚持这段边界是早已明确划定了的，所提出的根据是，在1913——1914年的西姆拉会议上，中国政府、西藏地方当局和英国政府三方面的代表共同划定了所谓的麦克马洪线。我曾经多次向阁下说明，西姆拉会议是英国阴谋把西藏从中国分割出去的重要步骤。在这次会议上讨论了所谓内藏、外藏的界线和西藏同中国其他部分之间的界线。同你在来信中所说的相反，所谓麦克马洪线从未在西姆拉会议上加以讨论，而是英国和西藏地方当局的代表，背着中国中央政府的代表，于1914年3月24日，也即是在西姆拉条约签订以前，在德里用秘密换文的方式决定的。这条界线，后来是作为西藏同中国其他部分之间的界线的一部分，标在西姆拉条约的附图之上的。所谓的麦克马洪线是英国对中国西藏地方执行侵略政策的产物，从未被中国的任何一个中央政府所承认，因此肯定是不合法的。至于西姆拉条约，当时中国中央政府的代表就没有正式签字，这是在条约上清楚地注明了的。在英国和西藏地方当局秘密换文以后一个相当长的时间内，英国既不敢公布有关的文件，也不敢改变地图上关于这段边界历来的画法。这条非法的界线曾经引起中国人民的极大愤慨。就是西藏地方当局，后来也对这条界线表示不满，并且在1947年印度独立以后致电阁下，要求印度归还这条非法界线以南的中国西藏地方的全部领土。这块领土相当于中国的浙江省，有九万平方公里之大。总理先生，中国怎么能够同意强迫接受这样一个丧权辱国、出卖领土、而且这块领土又是如此之大的非法界线呢？中国历来出版的地图对不丹以东中印边界的画法，真实地反映了所谓麦克马洪线划出以前的传统边界的实际情况。1917年印度测量局出版的“西藏和邻国”图和1929年大英百科全书的附图，对这段边界的画法，都同中国出版的地图一致。印度军队也只是在1951年中国西藏地方和平解放前后，才大规模地向所谓麦克马洪线以南的地区推进。因此，所谓这段边界早已明确划定的说法，显然是不能成立的。
    阁下在来信中还提到中国和锡金的边界。这个问题像中国和不丹的边界一样，并不属于我们目前讨论的范围。但是，我愿意借这个机会再一次说明，中国愿意同锡金和不丹友好相处、互不侵犯，而且一向尊重它们同印度的正当关系。
    从以上所述，可以看出，中国出版的地图历来对中印边界的画法，并不是没有根据的，而且英国和印度出版的地图对于中印边界的画法，最初也同中国出版的地图大体一致。事实上，不是中国出版的地图，而是英国和印度出版的地图，后来对于中印边界的画法作了片面的修改。虽然如此，但是，由于中印两国还没有通过友好谈判和共同勘察划定边界，因此，中国并没有要求印度修改地图。1954年，我也曾根据同样的理由，向阁下说明，中国政府在目前修订旧的地图，是不适宜的。但是，印度国内却有一些人对中国出版的地图大肆喧嚷，企图制造舆论压力，迫使中国接受印度关于中印边界的片面主张。用不着说，这种做法是既不明智、又不足取的。
    二、如上所述，中国政府对于中印边界问题一贯遵循着十分明确的方针，一方面肯定中印边界全部未经划定的事实，另一方面又面对现实，特别考虑到中印之间的友好关系，积极寻求对双方公平合理的解决办法，并且在边界问题解决以前，绝不片面改变两国边界久已存在的状况。
    在中印边界的东段，正如我在前面已经说过的，中国绝不承认所谓麦克马洪线，但是，中国军队从未越过这条线。这是为了维持边境的和睦，以利于边界问题的谈判和解决，丝毫也不意味着中国政府已经承认了这条线。鉴于阁下在最近给我的两次来信中，对于我过去曾经向阁下说明的这一点，显然有误解，我认为有必要再一次清楚地作以上的说明。
    在中印边界的西段，中国严格遵守传统的习惯线，对于印军一再侵入或者侵占中国领土的事件，中国政府始终以友好的态度，采取不同的方式，分别地加以处理。例如对于印度的军队和行政人员侵入乌热的问题，中国政府力求同印度政府谈判解决，避免冲突。对于侵入中国新疆西南部地区和侵入中国西藏地方的班公湖地区的印军，中国边防部队在依照国际惯例解除他们的武装以后，采取了说理的态度，要求他们离境，并且发还他们的武器。对于印军先后侵占什普奇山口、巴里加斯、桑、葱莎、波林三多、巨哇、曲惹、香扎、拉不底等地区，中国政府在发现这种情况以后，总是进行彻底的详细的调查，而不是立即激动地向印度政府提出指责。这些措施证明，中国政府是尽最大的努力来维护中印友谊的。
    尽管发生了上述的全部由于印军越境而引起的边界事件，但是，直到今年年初为止，中印边界的气氛总的说来还是良好的。在大约两千公里全部未定的中印边界上，始终没有发生军事冲突事件，这个事实本身就有力地证明，两国边界尚未划定以前，只要双方采取友好和合理的态度，在边境地区是可以保持和睦而不出现紧张局势的。
    三、但是，自从西藏叛乱发生以来，由于不能由中国方面负责的原因，边境局势日益紧张。大批西藏叛乱分子逃入印度以后，印度军队立即在中印边界的东段节节进逼，不仅片面地改变了两国边界久已存在的状况，越过了英国和西藏地方当局秘密换文的附图上标明的所谓麦克马洪线，而且还越过了印度现行出版的地图上所标明的边界线，这条线据说就是所谓麦克马洪线，但是，实际上在许多地方比所谓麦克马洪线更加深入中国境内。印军侵占了朗久，侵入了雅斜儿，并且仍然侵占着沙则、兼则马尼、塔马顿等中国领土，包庇在这个地区的西藏武装叛匪。印度的飞机也一再在中印边境侵犯中国的领空。尤其令人遗憾的是，不久以前，非法侵占朗久的印军，竟对驻扎在马及墩的中国边防部队进行武装袭击，使中国边防部队不得不为了自卫而予以还击。这是在中印边境上发生的第一次武装冲突事件。从以上所述可以看出，最近在中印边境出现的紧张局势，都是由于印军越境挑衅造成的，应该由印度方面负完全的责任。但是，印度政府却反而对中国政府提出种种毫无根据的指责，叫嚷中国侵略了印度，把中国边防部队在马及墩地区的自卫行动说成是武装挑衅。印度的许多政界人士和宣传机关更乘机散布大量反华言论，甚至公开主张采取轰炸中国领土等更大规模的挑衅行动。这样就掀起了半年来在印度的第二次反华运动。印度不承认中印边界未经划定的事实，变本加厉地从军事、外交和舆论等方面对中国施加压力，这就不能不令人怀疑，印度的企图是要把自己关于边界问题的片面主张强加于中国方面。必须指出，这种企图是永远不能实现的，而且这样做，除了损伤两国的友谊，使边界问题更加复杂化、更加难于解决以外，不可能有其他的结果。
    四、中印两国之间的友好关系是建筑在和平共处五项原则的基础之上的。中国政府一贯认为，我们两国之间的一切分歧都必须、也一定能够通过和平协商求得解决，而不应该使两国的友好关系受到影响。中国把西南边界看作是和平友好的边界。我可以向阁下保证，最近几个月来，中国政府派出警戒部队驻扎在中国西藏地方的东南部，只是为了防止残余的西藏武装叛匪出入边境，进行骚扰。这样做，显然有利于保证边境的安宁，而不会在任何方面形成对印度的威胁。阁下是五项原则的创始人之一，对于巩固和发展中印友谊作出过重要的贡献，而且经常强调中印友谊的重要性。对此，中国政府和中国人民是有深刻印象的。因此，我把中印边界的全部情况，系统地向阁下说明。我希望，阁下和印度政府将会根据中国政府的要求，立即采取措施，撤回越境的印度军队和行政人员，恢复两国边界久已存在的状况。这样，中印边境一时的紧张局势就会立刻和缓下来，笼罩着两国关系的阴云也会迅速消散，使关心中印友好关系的朋友们感到宽怀，使挑拨中印关系、制造紧张局势的人受到打击。
    致亲切的敬意。
