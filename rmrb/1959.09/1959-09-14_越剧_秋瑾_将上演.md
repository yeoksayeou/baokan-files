    Yue Opera "Qiu Jin" to be Performed
    The Shanghai Yue Opera Theatre is actively rehearsing a new play, "Qiu Jin," to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
    The Yue Opera "Qiu Jin" is divided into nine scenes, with the famous Yue Opera actress Yuan Xuefen playing Qiu Jin. Other important roles such as Xu Xilin, Wang Zifang, and Xu Jichen are mostly played by young actors.
    This play is an artistic creation based on Qiu Jin's revolutionary struggle history. The young male and female actors participating in the rehearsal of this play are mostly students who have just graduated from opera school. They are not only performing on the same stage with veteran actors such as Yuan Xuefen for the first time, but also are making efforts to strengthen the attempt to combine male and female performances.

    越剧“秋瑾”将上演
    上海越剧院正在积极排练新剧“秋瑾”，迎接国庆十周年。
    越剧“秋瑾”共分九场，由著名越剧演员袁雪芬饰演秋瑾，其他重要角色如徐锡麟、王子芳、徐寄尘等大都由青年演员分别担任。
    这个剧是在秋瑾的革命斗争史迹的基础上进行艺术加工创作的。参加排练这出戏的男女青年演员大都是刚从戏曲学校毕业不久的学生，他们不仅是第一次同袁雪芬等老演员一起同台演出，而且正努力地作加强男女合演的尝试。　（何其烈）
