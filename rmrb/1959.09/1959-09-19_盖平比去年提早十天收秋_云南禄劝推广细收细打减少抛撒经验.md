Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th: The autumn harvest battle in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, has begun. Currently, over 100,000 people are engaged in the harvest. As of the 12th, the county had harvested over 111,000 mu of major autumn crops, picked over 4,827,000 jin of cotton, and picked over 13,000,000 jin of apples. On the harvested land, the goal of short stubble and clean fields, with every grain returned to the granary, has been truly achieved.

In order to secure all the fruits of the bumper harvest, the communes throughout the county have made particularly full and meticulous preparations for this year's autumn harvest. In addition to organizing working groups to conduct in-depth investigations in key areas in early August, the Gaiping County Party Committee convened a mobilization meeting for autumn harvest preparations at the end of August, attended by over 1,600 people. Using the methods of recalling the past, making comparisons, and calculating detailed accounts, full ideological mobilization was carried out. All communes proposed to thoroughly carry out the autumn harvest work, ensuring that "a ten-year harvest yields a ten-year return, with not a single grain lost." All production teams properly arranged labor, and fully prepared and repaired the tools, threshing grounds, and roads needed for the autumn harvest. Due to the good and early preparations, the county's autumn harvest work started about ten days earlier than last year, beginning in early September.

Recently, the county Party committee organized an inspection team composed of the Party secretaries of each commune to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the county's autumn harvest work and promptly exchange experiences. On September 12, the county Party committee held a broadcast rally for reporting victories and comparing skills in the autumn harvest, attended by nearly 100,000 people. The commune members participating in the broadcast rally were all enthusiastic and full of vigor, resolutely expressing their response to the Party's call, guaranteeing a comprehensive victory in the autumn harvest battle, achieving both high yield and bumper harvest, and dedicating this achievement to the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

(By our newspaper) The CCP Luquan County Committee in Yunnan Province strengthens the political and ideological education of cadres and the masses, ensuring that the idea of bumper harvests, reducing waste, and returning every grain to the granary is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

On the eve of the autumn harvest, the county Party committee promptly strengthened the political and ideological education of cadres and the masses, mobilizing the masses to prepare ideologically first. It also put forward the fighting goal of "striving to increase grain production by another 5% to 10% on the basis of the estimated bumper harvest," mobilizing the broad masses to go all out and fight the last battle for increased production.

While extensively mobilizing the masses and raising their ideological awareness, the county Party committee further delved into Pingshan Commune, where harvesting started earlier, convened an on-site meeting, identified key measures for careful harvesting and threshing, and promoted them throughout the county. At the on-site meeting attended by over 400 people in Hedong Village, Pingshan Commune, detailed accounts of various increased production measures were calculated. For example, the Jiuxian Management District specifically inspected the millet that was harvested and threshed simultaneously; only one grain was lost within a five-inch square area. However, a lot of millet was wasted when it was harvested and then dried and then threshed. The practice of harvesting and threshing simultaneously was affirmed as a measure to ensure every grain was returned to the granary. The Pingshan Management District also inspected the millet straw threshed in the traditional way on the spot and found that a bunch of grass contained 130 grains of millet that were not threshed cleanly. With 750 bunches per mu, a significant amount would be lost. Through this on-site meeting, the commune mobilized all production teams to formulate plans to strive for a 10% increase in grain production per mu, and from the first day of the autumn harvest, the speed and quality of the autumn harvest were emphasized. After the county Party committee promoted these experiences, the measures of careful harvesting and threshing were deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Tongjie Commune mobilized the masses to carry out a mass activity to determine measures, specifically proposing the requirements: "Harvest millet when it is nine-tenths ripe; harvest corn when it is ripe, one ear at a time; buckwheat is easy to fall off, so harvest it promptly when it is eight-tenths ripe." Currently, 60% of the county's over 90,000 mu of early-maturing corn, rice, and potatoes have been harvested and returned to the granary, greatly reducing waste.

    盖平比去年提早十天收秋
    云南禄劝推广细收细打减少抛撒经验
    据新华社沈阳17日电　辽宁省盖平县的秋收战役已经打响。目前每天有十万多人投入秋收。到12日止，全县已收割大秋作物十一万一千多亩，同时已摘棉花四百八十二万七千多斤，摘苹果一千三百多万斤。在已收割的土地上，真正做到了楂短秆净，颗粒归仓。
    为了把大丰收的劳动果实全部拿到手，全县各公社对今年秋收准备工作做得特别充分细致。中共盖平县委除在8月上旬组织工作组深入重点调查摸底以外，8月底又召开了一千六百多人参加的秋收准备工作动员大会，采用回忆对比，算细账的办法，进行了充分的思想发动，各公社都提出要彻底搞好秋收工作，保证做到“十成年景十成收，颗颗粒粒都不丢”。所有生产队都妥善安排了劳动力，对秋收中需要的工具、场院、道路也都进行了充分的准备和整修。由于准备工作做得好、做得早，全县秋收工作比去年提前十天左右，在9月上旬就开始了。
    最近，县委组织了由各公社党委书记参加的检查团，对全县秋收工作进行了全面大检查，及时交流了经验。9月12日，县委又召开有近十万人参加的秋收报捷比武广播大会。参加广播大会的社员，个个热情洋溢，意气风发，坚决表示响应党的号召，保证全面打好秋收战役，作到丰产丰收，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。
    本报讯　中共云南禄劝县委加强对干部和群众的政治思想教育，让丰产丰收、减少抛撒浪费和颗粒还家的思想深入人心。
    秋收前夕，县委及时加强了干部、群众的政治思想教育，发动群众首先从思想上做好准备，并且提出了“争取在估产丰收的基础上再增收5％到10％的粮食”的奋斗目标，动员广大群众鼓足干劲，打增产的最后一仗。
    在广泛发动群众、提高思想的同时，县委又进一步深入到收割较早的屏山公社，召开现场会，找出细收细打的关键措施，向全县推广。在屏山公社河东庄召开的四百多人的现场会上，算了各项增产措施的细账。如旧县管理区具体检查了边收边打的谷子，五寸见方的范围才掉一颗；而割后晒、晒后再打的抛撒谷子很多，肯定了边收、边打是保证颗粒还家的措施。屏山管理区还当场检查了掼盆打的谷草，一把草上就发现有打不干净的饱谷子一百三十颗，每亩以七百五十把计算，就要少收不少。通过这次现场会，公社发动各生产队都制定了每亩力争多收一成粮食的计划，从开始秋收的第一天起，就把秋收的速度和质量抓起来。县委推广了这些经验后，细收、细打的措施深入人心。同街公社发动群众，开展了一次群众性订措施的活动，具体提出了“谷子九黄十收，包谷熟一包收一包，荞子容易脱落，熟八成就及时抢收”的要求。现在，全县九万多亩早熟的包谷、稻谷、洋芋已有60％抢收还家，抛撒大大减少。
