Dear Comrades:
	On behalf of the French delegation, I warmly thank the Chinese Communist Party for giving us the opportunity to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the People's Republic of China.

	I am very pleased to be able to take this rare opportunity to convey the fraternal respect of the French Communist Party, its General Secretary Maurice Thorez, the French working class, and the French people to the great Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people.

	After the great October Socialist Revolution, which marked a new era for the international workers' movement and progressive humanity, the liberation of China and the victory of the Chinese people's revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, in our view, is the most important event that has occurred worldwide since World War II.

	Indeed, since the vast China, with its 650 million people, has stood alongside the powerful Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the balance of power between the old capitalist world and the new socialist world has undergone a fundamental change in favor of socialism.

	In particular, the glorious example of the Chinese people has set off a new high tide in the struggle of the Asian and African people against colonial oppression and for independence. Furthermore, in the recent decade, the People's Republic of China has made extremely great achievements. The reforms you have carried out in just a few years for the benefit of your people exceed all that has been done in the past thousands of years. Based on the conditions of your country and the special conditions of your revolution, you have firmly relied on the worker-peasant alliance and, with the active participation of all progressive forces in the country, successfully created the conditions that will ensure the victory of socialist construction in China.

	Your revolution provides an extremely important experience, which shows the creativity of Marxism-Leninism.

	Therefore, the French Communists, like the Communists of all countries, have watched the progress of the new China with enthusiastic care and strong confidence in the past and present.
                * * * * * * 
	Dear Comrades: Your achievements, like those of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, are a powerful help to our struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism in France! In France, we have a government of personal dictatorship, which implements a thoroughly reactionary and corrupt policy in all aspects. The French big bourgeoisie, unable to solve the various problems raised by the colonial people's demand for independence, is keen to continue the five-year-long Algerian colonial war.

	In the international arena, the reactionary French government pursues an adventurous policy aimed at continuing the Cold War and hindering the relaxation of international tensions.

	That is how it feels hostile to the recent historic meeting between Comrade Khrushchev and the US President and the Soviet disarmament plan. But, it is obvious that Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the United States, and the disarmament plan he put forward to the United Nations in the name of the Soviet Union, fully conform to the interests and peace aspirations of the people of all countries -- including the French people who are under the heavy burden of military spending. Therefore, the French Communist Party, deeply aware of the need to defend the true interests of France and loyal to proletarian internationalism, is carrying out the following struggles:
      ——Against the Algerian war, striving for negotiations with the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic on the basis of respecting Algeria's right to independence and mutual benefit between the two countries.

    ——Striving for the relaxation of international tensions, the prohibition and destruction of atomic weapons, disarmament, and the friendly cooperation between the peoples of all countries.

    ——Striving for the People's China to enter the United Nations, and for the French government to recognize People's China.

	We believe that refusing to officially recognize the existence of the People's Republic of China, which has a population of 650 million and occupies an important position in international affairs, is indeed absurd.
            * * * * 
	Furthermore, we are deeply convinced that, due to the growing strength of the socialist camp, the growth of the world's forces of peace, and the development of the liberation movements of colonial and dependent countries, all the conspiracies of the French reactionaries, just like the conspiracies of the American and other imperialist reactionaries, will eventually be crushed.

	Dear Comrades!

	Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out many times: in tactics, and in terms of each special battle, it is inappropriate to underestimate the capitalist reactionary enemy, but from a strategic point of view and in the long run, we must absolutely not be intimidated, because capitalism has already been judged by history, and communism is sure to win.

	We, the French Communists, are fighting against the reactionary French regime established with the collusion of the right-wing Socialist leaders under the inspiration of this Leninist thought, and are working to unite the workers and democratic forces to defend the vital interests of our people, strive for peace, and restore democracy.

	Our struggle is arduous and difficult, but we fight with absolute confidence in the future. Because we know that here and elsewhere, this future does not belong to capitalism, but to the people, to communism. Everything we see and feel here will only strengthen our beliefs and will.

	The great achievements made by the Soviet Union, the great achievements made by your great country, and the great achievements made by all countries in the socialist camp,

	The strengthening of the unity of the socialist camp,

	The unbreakable unity of the international communist movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism,

	All this constitutes a reliable guarantee for the final victory of socialism and communism in the world.

	Long live peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries!

	Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party!

	Long live the unity of the Communist Parties of all countries!

	Long live communism! (Attached picture)

### 法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员  中央委员会书记、法国共产党代表团团长  瓦德克·罗歇同志的贺词

    法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员
    中央委员会书记、法国共产党代表团团长
    瓦德克·罗歇同志的贺词亲爱的同志们：
    我以法国代表团的名义，热烈地感谢中国共产党给予我们参加欢庆中华人民共和国十周年的机会。
    我感到十分高兴能够在这一个难得的时机向伟大的中国共产党和中国人民转达法国共产党、它的总书记莫里斯·多列士、法国工人阶级和人民的兄弟般的敬意。
    在标志着国际工人运动和进步人类进入新纪元的伟大的十月社会主义革命之后，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下的中国解放和中国人民革命的胜利，在我们看来，是第二次世界大战以后，在世界范围内发生的最重要的事件。
    诚然，自从幅员广阔、拥有六亿五千万人口的中国屹立于强大的苏联和其他社会主义国家的一边的时候起，旧资本主义世界和新社会主义世界之间的力量对比就起了有利于社会主义的根本变化。
    特别是中国人民的光荣榜样，掀起了亚非人民反对殖民主义压迫和争取独立斗争的新高潮。此外，在最近的十年中，中华人民共和国取得了极为巨大的成就。你们在短短几年内所进行的造福你们人民的改革，超过过去千百年来所做的一切。你们根据你们国家的情况和你们革命的特殊条件，牢牢地依靠工农联盟并在全国一切进步力量的积极参与下，成功地创造了使社会主义建设在中国一定取得胜利的条件。
    你们的革命提供了一条极为重要的经验，它显示出马克思列宁主义的创造力。
    因此，法国共产党人像各国共产党人一样，过去和现在都以热情的关怀和强烈的信心注视着新中国的前进步伐。
                * * * * * * 
    亲爱的同志们：你们的成就像苏联和社会主义阵营各国的成就一样，对我们在法国所从事的争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争是一个强有力的帮助！在法国我们有一个个人专权的政府，它在一切方面执行着彻头彻尾的反动和腐朽的政策。法国大资产阶级，没有能力解决由于殖民地人民要求独立而提出的各项问题，而热中于继续进行为期五年的阿尔及利亚殖民战争。
    在国际方面，法国反动政府奉行着旨在继续进行冷战，阻挠缓和国际局势的冒险政策。
    就是这样，它对赫鲁晓夫同志和美国总统最近举行的历史性的会晤以及苏联的裁军计划都怀着敌意。但是，显而易见，赫鲁晓夫同志在美国的旅行，以及他以苏联的名义向联合国提出的裁军计划，完全符合于各国人民——包括在军事负担重压下的法国人民——的利益与和平愿望。因此，法国共产党，深知要保卫法国的真正利益，并忠于无产阶级国际主义，正在进行着下列各项斗争：
      ——反对阿尔及利亚战争，争取在尊重阿尔及利亚独立权利和两国互利的基础上同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府进行谈判。
    ——争取缓和国际局势，禁止和销毁原子武器，裁减军备，争取各国人民之间的友好合作。
    ——争取使人民中国进入联合国，并使法国政府承认人民中国。
    我们认为，拒绝正式承认拥有六亿五千万人口、在国际事务中占有重要地位的中华人民共和国的存在，的确是十分荒谬的。
            * * * * 
    此外，我们深信：由于社会主义阵营日益增长的力量，全世界和平力量的壮大，以及殖民地和附属国人民解放运动的发展，法国反动派的一切阴谋，正和美国和其他帝国主义反动派的阴谋一样，最后都将被粉碎。
    亲爱的同志们！
    毛泽东同志曾经多次指出：在战术上，以及就每一个特殊的战役来说，低估资本主义反动派敌人是不适当的，但是从战略的角度并且从长远来看，绝对不应当被吓倒，因为资本主义已经被历史作出了判决，而共产主义肯定要获得胜利。
    我们，法国共产党人，就是在这一列宁主义思想的鼓舞下，对在右翼社会党首脑的同谋下建立起来的法国反动政权进行斗争，并且为了团结保卫我国人民的切身利益、争取和平和恢复民主的工人和民主力量而努力。
    我们的战斗是艰苦困难的，但我们怀着对未来的绝对信心而进行斗争。因为我们知道，在我们这里和在其他各地一样，这一未来不属于资本主义，而属于人民，属于共产主义。我们在这里看到的和感受到的一切只会加强我们的信念和意志。
    苏联取得的巨大成就，你们伟大国家取得的巨大成就，社会主义阵营所有国家取得的巨大成就，
    社会主义阵营团结的加强，
    在马克思列宁主义基础上的国际共产主义运动牢不可破的团结，
    所有这一切构成社会主义和共产主义在全世界取得最后胜利的可靠的保证。
    各国人民之间的和平与友谊万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    各国共产党的团结一致万岁！
    共产主义万岁！（附图片）
