    Rapidly Developing China's Steel Industry
    Wang Heshou, Minister of Metallurgical Industry
          From 150,000 tons to 12 million tons
    Our people have mastered their own destiny for a full ten years this year. Ten years is only a short time in the course of history, but for the Chinese people, it has been a decade of earth-shattering changes. If we compare China's current situation with the past, it is hard to believe that only ten years have passed. Let's look at this great change through the lens of the steel industry!
    Ten years ago, China's already weak steel industry was ruined by the Kuomintang reactionaries. In 1949, when Japan produced 3.11 million tons of steel, China only produced about 5% of that - 158,000 tons of steel. Among the 35 countries in the world with an annual steel production of more than 10,000 tons, we ranked 26th. Needless to say, we lagged far behind major capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, Germany, and Japan. We were also far behind Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands. Our steel production at that time was only a quarter of the steel production of the British Empire's colony, the Union of South Africa, and about the same as Switzerland, which had a population of only about five million. In 1949, the world produced 160 million tons of steel, and China's output accounted for less than one-thousandth of the total.
    Ten years later, in 1959, China will produce more than 12 million tons of steel. Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, and other countries have long been left behind. In the ten years (1949-1959), China's steel production increased 74 times, and its position in world steel production will rise directly from 26th to 7th.
    Ten years ago, there were only 19 enterprises in China producing iron, steel, or steel products, including large and small ones (excluding rural handicrafts). The largest, Anshan Iron and Steel, only produced 100,000 tons of steel. Most of these 19 enterprises were located in coastal areas. In the vast and rich inland areas, there were only a few small-scale iron and steel plants in Daye, Chongqing, Kunming, and other places.
    Ten years later, the number of iron and steel enterprises in China is no longer 19, but hundreds. The amount of steel produced by Anshan Iron and Steel this year is not 100,000 tons, but dozens of times that amount. Now, 28 provinces and autonomous regions across the country, except for Tibet, can produce a large amount of pig iron.
    Ten years ago, there were only seven blast furnaces smoking in China, and the volume of the largest blast furnace was only 596 cubic meters. Each cubic meter of blast furnace volume could only produce 620 kilograms of iron per day and night. There were only twelve open-hearth furnaces pouring molten steel, and the volume of the largest open-hearth furnace was only 150 tons, with each square meter of furnace bottom only producing 2.4 tons of steel per day and night. Only 22 electric furnaces could be put into production, and the capacity of the largest electric furnace was only five tons.
    Ten years later, the volume of blast furnaces put into production in China has increased dozens of times. The average pig iron production per cubic meter of volume per day and night in large and medium-sized blast furnaces has exceeded 0.6 tons by 2.5 times, with the highest exceeding four times. The number of open-hearth furnaces put into production has increased by about ten times, and the largest open-hearth furnace ten years ago was only a quarter of the size of the current largest open-hearth furnace. The average steel production per square meter of furnace bottom area per day and night has exceeded 3.5 times that of ten years ago, with the highest exceeding six times. There are already 211 electric furnaces in production, with a total capacity exceeding eight to nine times that of ten years ago.
    Ten years ago, needless to say, even a steel rail or a ton of high-quality steel needed to be imported from abroad. Even steel windows and iron nails for construction had to be purchased from capitalist countries.
    Ten years later, China has smelted more than 500 kinds of steel and rolled more than 6,000 different specifications of steel products. Not only are heavy rails produced, but also steel beams for the Yangtze River Bridge and steel plates for 10,000-ton giant ships can now be produced.
    In short, ten years ago, the proportion of China's steel production in the world's steel production was negligible. But ten years later, China has become one of the seven major steel-producing countries in the world with an annual steel production of more than 10 million tons. Ten years ago, China's steel industry was squeezed by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for many years and was like a sick person lying helplessly on the brink of death. But today, ten years later, this malnourished, poor, and backward patient is growing into a steel giant and striding forward towards the morning glow. Who can say that this is not a great change?
      From One High Speed to Another
    The most fundamental reason for the great changes in China's steel industry in the past ten years is that China's steel industry has been developing at a high speed. If there are many characteristics in the development of China's steel industry, then the most basic characteristic is high speed. And the characteristic of high speed is to go from one high speed to another.
    In 1949, after the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, achieved revolutionary victory throughout the country, they immediately began to restore the steel industry on the ruins. The liberated working class removed weeds from the factory, drove out wild animals from the mines, shattered the solidified iron blocks in the blast furnaces, and repaired the rusty equipment with missing legs or arms, so that China's steel industry, which had been in a state of dying for a long time, was revived. When the Japanese imperialist elements fled China, they contemptuously said to us: "Give you Anshan, let you grow sorghum. If you want to restore Anshan Iron and Steel, calmly speaking, it will take twenty years." Imperialists could not understand how great the strength of the liberated working class under the wise leadership of our Party was. In their view, we rapidly mastered the steel industry technology that we could not possibly master, and the restoration of the steel industry was carried out at a high speed. After only three years from 1950 to 1952, we not only completely restored the dilapidated factories and mines, but also greatly improved the production level of these enterprises. As a result, China's steel production increased from 158,000 tons in 1949 to 1.35 million tons in 1952, exceeding the highest steel production in China's history in 1943 by 46%. During this period, capitalist countries around the world, except for the United States because it was not damaged by the war, were also restoring the steel industry destroyed by World War II. But in terms of the speed of recovery, no one can compare with China. From 158,000 tons to 1.35 million tons, the average annual growth rate was 104%, while the fastest-recovering capitalist countries, Japan, West Germany, and Italy, had an average annual growth of only 31%, 19.5%, and 19.8%. At this time, China's steel production in the world had risen from 26th to 18th. It can be seen that the development of China's steel industry has been at a high speed from the day of recovery.
    Although the recovery speed was very fast, the foundation left over from old China was pitiful, and it was far from meeting the needs of China's construction. In 1953, China began its first five-year plan. During this period, under the guidance of our Party's correct policy of concentrating financial and material resources to develop the steel industry, we began large-scale capital construction of the steel industry. Due to China's long-term oppression by imperialism, China's steel industry had a serious semi-colonial imprint. Not only was the equipment old and the working conditions of workers extremely poor, but also the steel industry was extremely unbalanced internally, and the layout of the steel industry was also extremely unreasonable. In order to facilitate the exploitation of raw materials and the dumping of finished products by imperialism, the amount of iron ore produced in China far exceeded the capacity of iron and steel smelting. The rolling capacity was even more pitifully small in terms of quantity and variety. In order to facilitate control, transportation, and the utilization of the large labor force in the coastal areas, imperialists placed steel enterprises in the coastal areas. These, of course, are completely unsuitable for the needs of China's socialist construction. The capital construction of our steel industry must first fundamentally eliminate the scars left over from history, and rationally establish a complete steel industry system with modernized equipment in accordance with China's resource distribution and development needs. For this purpose, during the first five-year plan period, we not only expanded Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Chongqing, Daye, and Taiyuan steel plants, but also established two large steel bases in Wuhan in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and Baotou in the northwest. From then on, China's steel industry has been advancing by leaps and bounds along the direction indicated by our Party.
    When we first started large-scale construction of China's steel industry, foreign imperialist elements and domestic elements hostile to socialism believed that we had neither the strength nor the ability to carry out such large-scale construction. They pinned their hopes on the failure of our construction. But the wheel of history moved completely in the opposite direction of their hopes. During the first five-year plan period, we basically completed the Anshan Iron and Steel Base; started the construction of two new bases in Wuhan and Baotou; and also built and expanded dozens of medium and small-sized steel plants. The old steel plants have also undergone technical transformation to improve their technical equipment level. In this way, during the first five-year plan period, China's steel production increased from 1.35 million tons in 1952 to 5.35 million tons, with an average annual increase of 31.7%. During this period, capitalist countries with faster growth in steel production, such as Japan and Italy, only had an average annual increase of just over 10%, far behind our growth rate. In 1957, the last year of the first five-year plan, China's steel production ranked ninth in the world, rising from eighteenth in 1952. Facts have proved that the development of China's steel industry is not only at a high speed during the recovery period, but also at a high speed during the large-scale construction period of the first five-year plan.
    In 1958, China began its second five-year plan. The question of how fast China's steel industry should develop was placed before us. At this time, some people came out to speak. They said that the foundation of the steel industry in the first five-year plan was small, and the speed of development seemed to be faster. The foundation in the second five-year plan period was larger, and it was impossible to maintain a high speed. It would be almost enough to produce 9 million tons of steel by 1962. But the congress of our Party did not adopt the opinions of these people. When drafting the second five-year plan in 1956, it proposed a plan to produce 12 million tons of steel by 1962. As early as the spring of 1956, Chairman Mao put forward the policy instruction of the "Ten Major Relationships" in socialist construction: pointing out that China has 500 million farmers, and it is necessary to develop and improve agricultural production and light industrial production. In order to develop and improve agriculture and light industry, heavy industry needs to vigorously support agriculture to realize the technological transformation of agriculture. This road of vigorously developing agriculture and light industry is also the road to promote the rapid development of heavy industry. In 1958, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and the policy of walking on two legs. Then, the slogan of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward, and the great call to double steel production in 1958 were put forward. From then on, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line and under the guidance of the Party's correct policies, the people of the whole country launched a mass movement to run the steel industry on a scale never seen in history. This opened up a new speed for the development of China's steel industry. In 1958 alone, China's steel production increased from 5.35 million tons to 11.08 million tons. Even excluding the output of native steel, the 8 million tons of steel produced by modern equipment increased by 2.65 million tons compared with 1957, with a growth rate of 49.5%. The distance we crossed this year took six years in the United States, eleven years in Britain, five years in Germany, and eighteen years in Japan. This year, we also left two countries behind, rising from ninth to seventh in steel production among all countries in the world. This is a new speed of development created by China.
    Imperialists hate our Great Leap Forward, and desperately curse our Great Leap Forward. Domestic elements hostile to socialism are also afraid of the Great Leap Forward. They echoed the imperialists, saying that our Great Leap Forward had failed. A small number of right-leaning opportunists were also collecting some temporary and partial shortcomings that were inevitable in the Leap Forward, attacking the Great Leap Forward. Although the starting points of foreign imperialists, domestic socialist hostile elements, and right-leaning opportunists in opposing the Great Leap Forward were not entirely the same, they all hoped that we would abandon the general line and no longer engage in the Great Leap Forward. They hoped that our socialist construction would stagnate or proceed slowly. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country refuted all kinds of slanders, criticized the views of right-leaning opportunism, united as one, adhered to the general line, adhered to the Great Leap Forward, and put forward the battle cry of completing the 12 million-ton steel target for the last year of the second five-year plan this year. From 8 million tons to 12 million tons, an increase of 4 million tons per year, the growth rate is 50%, which will exceed the speed of the first year of the Great Leap Forward (1958).
    Since the victory of the Chinese revolution, it can be clearly seen from the development process of steel that China's steel industry has always been developing at a high speed in the past ten years. The recovery period was high speed, the first five-year plan period was high speed, and since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it has entered another higher speed. Such continuous high speed for ten years, and creating a higher speed after the production base reached 5 million tons, is unprecedented in history. In the past ten years, our average annual growth rate of steel, including native steel, was 60.5%, while excluding native steel, it was 54.5%. During the same period, the growth rate of steel production in capitalist countries was 1% in the United States, 2.6% in Britain, 5.4% in France, 10.2% in West Germany, 13.1% in Italy, and 16.3% in Japan. Does the comparison of our speed with the speed of these capitalist countries not illustrate that the speed created by China is a historical miracle? It is precisely this miracle that fully illustrates how brilliant and great the achievements of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of our Party and Chairman Mao in the past ten years are.
            Great Harvests of the Great Leap Forward
    1958 was a great year. In this year, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, China's political, economic, cultural, scientific, educational, and ideological fronts were all making a Great Leap Forward. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, China's steel industry has made brilliant achievements in all aspects. At present, the situation of the Great Leap Forward is still developing, and the growth of the steel industry is proceeding at an even higher speed. Although the Great Leap Forward has only been going on for more than a year, it is not yet possible to comprehensively summarize the achievements of the steel industry in all aspects of the Great Leap Forward. But from the facts that are manifested before us, we can already see that the following aspects have great significance.
    First, the result of the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry in the past year has raised the development speed of China's steel industry to a new stage. As mentioned earlier, in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the development speed of China's steel industry increased by 107% in terms of total steel production, and 49.5% in terms of foreign steel production. The continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 will increase steel production by another 50% compared with 1958. The growth rate in these two years far exceeds the average annual growth rate of 31.7% during the first five-year plan. This iron fact fundamentally shattered the pseudo-arguments that the growth rate of steel in the second five-year plan could not exceed that of the first five-year plan, and that the larger the base, the slower the growth rate, etc., proving that our Party's theory that China's socialist construction can and should be at a high speed, which was put forward at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and re-emphasized at the Second Congress of the Eighth Central Committee, is completely correct. Before the Great Leap Forward, there were different understandings about the development speed of China's steel industry. One type of person, starting from the theory of decreasing speed, believed that the high speed during our first five-year plan period was a temporary phenomenon. The foundation in the second five-year plan was larger, and it was impossible to maintain the speed like that of the first five-year plan. They advocated setting the steel production target for the second five-year plan lower. Another opinion believed that according to the Party's theory of building socialism at a high speed, a "poor and blank" country like China with a population of 650 million must develop the steel industry as soon as possible in order to adapt to the needs of accelerating the development of socialist construction, and that agriculture and light industry have made demands on heavy industry, and they have opened up broad prospects for the development of heavy industry. They believe that for a considerable period of time to come, although the steel base will increase, the growth rate may not be decreasing, because the speed reached in the first five-year plan is not a limit; according to China's many favorable factors, the growth rate of the steel industry in the second five-year plan can not only strive not to be lower than the previous five-year plan, but may also strive to exceed the previous five-year plan.
    The facts of the Great Leap Forward in steel prove that China can create its own high speed according to its specific conditions. The practice of the Great Leap Forward has solved this problem, which is of great significance. Because the high-speed development of the steel industry is by no means just a matter of the steel industry itself. The faster the development of the steel industry, the faster the development of other industries and transportation industries will inevitably be promoted. Just as the increase in the development speed of agriculture will promote the development speed of industry, the high-speed development of the steel industry will inevitably promote the acceleration of the entire socialist construction.
    Second, the "small foreign groups" that appeared in the process of the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry showed their strong vitality from the very beginning. It not only enabled China to increase huge steel production capacity within a year, but also proved that the Party's policy of simultaneously promoting large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, simultaneously promoting indigenous methods and foreign methods, and simultaneously promoting central industry and local industry, is the way to develop China's steel industry and even all industries at a high speed. In the mass movement of running the steel industry on a large scale in 1958, a front was opened up from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups" in addition to the large foreign groups. In just one year, this front has yielded fruitful results, adding medium and small-sized blast furnaces with a production capacity of more than 10 million tons; medium and small-sized converters with a production capacity of more than 7 million tons, and many medium and small-sized mines, small foreign coking ovens, and small indigenous coking ovens. With these small foreign groups, China's steel production can continue to leap forward in the future, which is of extremely great significance to us.
    Here we cannot help but recall that when our Party, based on China's conditions, put forward the policy of simultaneously promoting large, medium, and small enterprises, some people could not understand it. They mechanically applied foreign experience, believing that the larger the steel enterprise, the more reasonable it was. They opposed engaging in medium and small-sized steel enterprises, saying, "Can small blast furnaces be considered a 'line of business'?" Building many small enterprises will become a "burden" that cannot be carried and will be put down, which will cause passivity in the future. In their eyes, only enterprises like Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel are the real "line of business," and "small foreign groups" are not to be desired. But the mass movement of running the steel industry on a large scale, based on the Party's policy of walking on two legs, built so many small foreign groups in one year, increased huge production capacity, and suddenly raised the construction speed and production level of China's steel industry to a new height, and laid the foundation for continuing the Great Leap Forward in the future. Facts have proved that "small foreign groups" are not a burden, but a treasure, which is a victory for the Party's policy. The emergence of this victory has solved the doubts of many people about "small foreign groups," that is, about the Party's policy of walking on two legs. It made everyone clearly see that walking on two legs is the correct way to develop China's steel industry at a high speed. Without "small foreign groups," it would be fundamentally impossible for the development of China's steel industry to have such a high speed. The solution of this problem will have a significant impact on the future development of China's steel industry.
    Third, the Great Leap Forward in the past year has begun to correctly solve the problem of the layout of China's steel industry, greatly changing the face of China's steel industry. China's steel industry, which was left over from old China with a semi-colonial imprint, has undergone major changes after three years of recovery and the efforts during the first five-year plan period, but the problem of unreasonable layout has not been fundamentally solved. By the end of 1957, the amount of steel produced in inland China was still very small, and many provinces with large populations and abundant resources, such as Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangxi, could not produce steel at all, or only produced a very small amount of steel. Most provinces across the country had to transport a ton of steel from Anshan Iron and Steel or Shanghai. For a country like China, the layout of the steel industry is of strategic significance. Failure to completely solve this problem will have a serious impact on national security and the development of the national economy. In the past, some people regarded solving this problem as a very difficult task. Whenever the rational layout of the steel industry was mentioned, they always thought that it was a matter of ten or twenty years later. But this problem, which was considered difficult, began to find a shortcut to solve it in just one year during the mass movement of running the steel industry on a large scale. Now, in addition to having several, dozens of small iron-smelting foreign groups, all provinces and autonomous regions, except Tibet, are also building one, two, or more medium and small-sized steel plants. Except for Tibet, all provinces and autonomous regions will produce a large amount of pig iron; except for a few provinces and autonomous regions, they will produce tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of tons of steel. Shandong is the best example. A year ago, Shandong Province was still a blank area in the steel industry. After a year, the situation has changed greatly. Iron and steel smelting bases are dotted throughout the province. This year, it will produce more than 1.3 million tons of pig iron and more than 160,000 tons of steel, which is thousands of tons more than the total steel production in the country in 1949, and four times more than the total pig iron production in the country at that time. Looking at the face of China's steel industry on the map, steel enterprises that were only concentrated in a few provinces in the past have now begun to disperse to the whole country. This change is of great significance to the development of industrial and agricultural production in various provinces and autonomous regions. China is a country with a vast area and a large population, and it is very necessary to establish local steel industries to meet the needs of local economic development. Now this nationwide steel network has been laid out. After two or three years of effort, all provinces and autonomous regions will have a steel industry with a relatively complete production system. There is no doubt that this will have a significant impact on China's entire socialist construction, and this impact will become more and more obvious in the future.
    Fourth, in the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry, the broad masses of workers responded to Chairman Mao's call to liberate their minds, break down superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and in a very short period of time, raised the technical level of China's steel industry to a new height. In the past, the technical level of China's steel industry was backward. After the efforts during the first five-year plan period, with the help of Soviet experts, there has been a great improvement. But in general, many major economic indicators are still relatively backward. Taking the utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces as an example, the national average in 1952 was only 1.023 tons, and in 1957 it was only 1.321 tons. At that time, the utilization coefficient of the world's most advanced blast furnaces had reached about 1.5 tons. The backwardness of the technical level is certainly related to our lack of experience on the one hand, and also due to the existence of dogmatic habits and metaphysical thinking methods in the ideological field on the other hand. In last year's Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of workers liberated their minds, broke down superstitions, and attacked metaphysical viewpoints, immediately forming a high tide of technological revolution. Many old technical formulas were overturned, and a large number of new inventions and creations emerged, and a new situation appeared in the technical field. Major technical and economic indicators have leaped to the world's advanced ranks. For example, the utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces, many technicians believed in the past that it was impossible or impossible to reach 2 tons in the short term, but in September last year, the blast furnace of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant began to break through the 2-ton mark, and has been continuing to rise since then. In the second quarter of this year, it has reached 2.382 tons; the No. 1 blast furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and the No. 3 and 9 large blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have also broken through the 2-ton mark one after another. In the open-hearth furnace aspect, the utilization coefficient of the small open-hearth furnace of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant reached 14 tons, and the large open-hearth furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel exceeded 9 tons; these are the current world's advanced records. The new method of alkaline converter steelmaking and the new method of firing refractory bricks have also been created by the masses. The scientific research personnel originally planned to spend several years to establish China's alloy steel system based on China's resources, but the problem was basically solved within one year. The synthesis of these achievements has raised the technical level of China's steel industry to a new stage.
    This technological revolution and technological innovation movement, which started from breaking down superstitions and liberating minds, is very meaningful to us. It has strengthened our ambition, made the broad masses of workers dare to break through the shackles of old experiences and formulas, dare to challenge outdated things, and dare to create new theories and new formulas. Because the technical mystery viewpoint has been broken through, technology has come out of the circle of technicians and become a topic for the broad masses to study, which has made our technical front appear lively and prosperous. On this basis, we are more confident and courageous to march towards the peak of technology.
    Fifth, in the mass movement of running the steel industry on a large scale, the capital construction of the steel industry has also achieved a series of revolutionary victories, especially the shortening of construction periods and the saving of funds are particularly significant. In the past, when mentioning the time for capital construction of the steel industry, it was always calculated in "years" as the unit. It took two years to design a steel plant, one year to build a large blast furnace, one and a half years to build an open-hearth furnace workshop, and five or six years to build a joint enterprise. But last year, during the Great Leap Forward, everyone went all out, aimed high, broke down superstitions in terms of construction periods, and the construction progress of many projects was accelerated, and not just accelerated a little, but doubled. For example, the large blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel was completed in less than five months, while in the past, it took one year to build such a large blast furnace. A large steelmaking workshop in Shanghai was completed in less than two months, while the same project in the past took more than half a year. In this way, there has been a revolution in the concept of construction speed.
    In terms of investment in steel capital construction, on the one hand, because the minds of the design personnel have been liberated, they can now carry out designs in accordance with China's specific conditions and adapt to local conditions. On the other hand, because of the accelerated construction period, the creation and promotion of new construction and installation technologies have greatly saved investment in capital construction. The same project cost about one-third less in funds after the Great Leap Forward than before the Great Leap Forward. Such major events as doubling the construction period and saving one-third of the investment, which no one had thought of in the past, were not only conceived by the masses in the mass movement of running the steel industry on a large scale, but also carried out.
    Sixth, in the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry, there is also a great harvest, that is, finding a most fundamental method of running industry—the mass line of the mass movement. In the past, when carrying out revolutionary struggles, everyone understood the need to achieve the purpose of the revolution through mass movements. But when it came to running industry during the construction period, it was thought that industrial technology was complex, production was tense, and unified command was required, so it was only possible to handle affairs through top-down rules and regulations and administrative orders, and it was not possible to engage in mass movements. It seemed that the masses would cause some "trouble" to the enterprise. As a result, for a period of time, the excellent tradition of the Party's mass line was abandoned on the industrial front. Emphasis was placed on the power of things, and the power of people was underestimated. In last year's Great Leap Forward, the past methods of running industry were changed. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, mass movements were launched on a large scale. From small and medium-sized enterprises to large joint enterprises, mass movements were launched vigorously in the steel industry. In the mass movement, cadres, technicians, and workers were united, and they worked together to do a good job in production. In the mass movement, the creativity and wisdom of the working class were greatly brought into play; many outdated rules and regulations that restricted the development of productive forces were broken; many difficulties were solved under the power of the mass movement; the face of the enterprise was immediately changed, and production was booming. With the same equipment, after the mass movement was launched, the production capacity of some has increased by one-third compared with the past, some has increased by one-half, and some has doubled, and the potential of the enterprise has been greatly brought into play. In short, the result of launching mass movements on a large scale has brought about a completely new situation in the steel industry. Solving the problem of whether mass movements can be launched on a large scale in industrial enterprises in the Great Leap Forward is of inestimable significance to us in running socialist industry well, establishing the correct system of enterprise management, and giving play to the power of socialist industry. The attitude towards the mass movement is the key to whether we can make a Great Leap Forward and whether we can implement the general line.
    In the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry, due to our lack of experience, some shortcomings have also been produced. For example, during a certain period, too much labor was used, and some small blast furnaces and small converters still had the shortcomings of high cost and poor quality. But all these shortcomings, some have been solved, and some are being solved. In terms of their nature, they are all local and temporary shortcomings, and many are shortcomings that are difficult to avoid in the growth process of new things. Compared with the great achievements that have been achieved, this can only be a matter of nine fingers versus one finger.
              Marching Towards New Victories
    The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party put forward a great task to the workers on the national steel front: to complete the original target for the last year of the second five-year plan—1962—within this year. The millions of steel troops across the country immediately responded to this great call of the Party. Anshan Iron and Steel, China's largest steel base, proposed to guarantee the completion of the annual steel plan ten days ahead of schedule; steel workers in Shanghai, another large steel base, were determined to guarantee the overfulfillment of this year's steel production plan. From Tianshan to the East Sea coast, from Heilongjiang to Hainan Island, all steel enterprise workers are full of confidence and are fighting to overfulfill the target of 12 million tons of steel.
    Now, the situation on our steel front is a situation of continuing the Great Leap Forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. Since entering August, the broad masses of workers have responded to the Party's call to oppose right-leaning and encourage hard work, and have launched a new upsurge in production. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that the successful overfulfillment of 12 million tons of steel is guaranteed to be realized.
    Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the general line guiding our direction forward, and with the help of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, as long as we are not arrogant or rash, implement political leadership, continue to liberate our minds, break down superstitions, and launch mass movements on a large scale, China's steel industry will surely continue to make Great Leaps Forward and move from victory to victory. We must resolutely strive to realize the task assigned to us by the Party to catch up with Britain in ten years ahead of schedule. (Attached picture)

    高速度发展的我国钢铁工业
    冶金工业部部长　王鹤寿
          从十五万吨到一千二百万吨
    我国人民掌握自己的命运，今年刚满十周年。十年，在历史的进程上，只是一个短暂的时间，但是对我国人民来讲，却是翻天复地的十年。如果把我国今天的面貌和过去对照一下，那就很难相信时间在我们面前只走过十年。让我们从钢铁工业上看看这个伟大的变化吧！
    十年前，我国原来就十分薄弱的钢铁工业，被国民党反动派搞得稀烂。1949年，当日本生产三百一十一万吨钢的时候，我国只生产了它的5％左右——十五点八万吨钢。在世界上年产钢一万吨以上的三十五个国家中排队，我们排在第二十六位。不用说远远落在美、英、德、日本等主要资本主义国家之后，就是与意大利、比利时、卢森堡、瑞典、奥地利、荷兰相比，我们也落后得很远。我们那时候的钢产量，只有大英帝国的殖民地南非联邦钢产量的四分之一，和人口只有约五百万的瑞士差不多。1949年全世界生产了一亿六千万吨钢，我国产量占总产量的千分之一还不到。
    十年后的1959年，我国将生产一千二百万吨以上的钢，意大利、比利时、卢森堡等国，都早已落在我们的后面。十年中（1949—1959年）我国钢产量增长七十四倍，在世界钢产量的位置上，将从第二十六位直线上升到第七位。
    十年前，我国生产钢铁或钢材的企业，大大小小都算上（农村手工业不算），只有十九个，最大的鞍钢，不过生产十万吨钢。这十九个企业，多数在沿海地区，在广阔而富饶的内地，只有大冶、重庆、昆明等地有几个小规模的钢铁厂。
    十年后，我国钢铁企业的数目，已经不是十九个，而是几百个了。鞍钢今年生产钢的数量，不是十万吨，而将是十万吨的数十倍了。现在全国二十八个省、自治区，除西藏以外都已经能够生产大量的生铁。
    十年前，我国冒烟的高炉只有七座，最大高炉的容积只有五百九十六立方米。每立方米高炉容积一昼夜只能生产六百二十公斤的铁。流钢水的平炉只有十二座，最大平炉的容积只有一百五十吨，每平方米炉底每昼夜只能生产二点四吨钢。能开工生产的电炉只有二十二座，最大的电炉容量只有五吨。
    十年后，我国投入生产的高炉的容积已经增加了几十倍，大型和中型高炉每立方米容积每昼夜生产的生铁，平均已经超过零点六吨的二点五倍，最高的超过四倍。投入生产的平炉已经增加了约十倍，十年前最大的平炉只及现在最大平炉的四分之一。每平方米炉底面积每昼夜生产的钢，平均已超过十年前的三点五倍，最高超过六倍。电炉投入生产的已有二百一十一座，总容量超过十年前的八—九倍。
    十年前，不用说用一根钢轨、一吨优质钢材都需要从外国进口，就是建筑用的钢窗和铁钉，也要向资本主义国家购买。
    十年后，我国已经冶炼五百多种钢种，轧制六千多种不同规格的钢材。不但生产重轨，而且像长江大桥的钢梁，万吨巨轮的钢板，都已经能够生产了。
    总之，十年前我国钢铁的产量在世界钢铁产量中所占的比重，是微不足道的，而十年后，我国已经成为世界上年产钢铁超过一千万吨的七大产钢国家之一。十年前，我国钢铁工业被帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义多年压榨得简直像一个站在死亡线上无力呻吟的病人，而十年后的今天，这个营养不良、贫穷落后的病人，正成长为一个钢铁巨人，而且正向着朝霞，大步迈进。谁能说这不是一个伟大的变化？
      从一个高速度走上另一个高速度
    我国钢铁工业在十年的进程中，能有这样伟大的变化，最根本的问题是在于我国钢铁工业一直在高速度的发展。如果说我国钢铁工业发展有许多特点的话，那末一个最基本的特点就是高速度。而高速度的特点又是从一个高速度走上另一个高速度。
    1949年我国人民在党和伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，在全国范围内取得了革命胜利以后，立即在废墟上开始恢复钢铁工业。解放了的工人阶级，铲掉了厂里的野草，赶掉了矿洞里的野兽，炸碎了高炉里凝固的铁块，修复了生锈的不是缺腿就是缺胳膊的设备，使长期以来处于奄奄一息的我国钢铁工业，重新恢复了生机。日本帝国主义分子在逃离我国的时候曾蔑视我们说：“把鞍山给你们，让你们去种高粱吧，你们要想恢复鞍钢么，平心静气地说需要二十年。”帝国主义不能理解，在我们党的英明领导下的解放了的工人阶级有多么伟大的力量。在他们看来，我们不可能掌握的钢铁工业技术，我们迅速掌握了，钢铁工业的恢复工作，在高速度地进行着。仅仅经过1950—1952年三年的时间，我们不仅完全恢复了被毁坏得破烂不堪的工厂、矿山，而且把这些企业的生产水平大大提高了。于是我国钢的产量就从1949年的十五点八万吨，提高到了1952年的一百三十五万吨，超过我国历史上钢产量最高的1943年的46％。在这个时期，世界资本主义国家，除了美国因为没有受到战争破坏外，也都在恢复被第二次世界大战破坏的钢铁工业。但是在恢复的速度上，谁也不能和我国相比。从十五点八万吨到一百三十五万吨，每年平均增长速度是104％，而这个时期资本主义国家恢复最快的日本、西德和意大利，也不过每年平均增长31％、19.5％和19.8％。这时我国的钢产量在世界上已从第二十六位上升到第十八位。由此可以看出，我国钢铁工业的发展，从恢复的那天起，就是高速度。
    尽管恢复的速度是很快的，但是旧中国遗留下来的基础是可怜的，它远远地不能满足我国建设的需要。1953年，我国开始了第一个五年计划，这个时期在我们党的集中财力、物力发展钢铁工业的正确方针指导下，我们开始了大规模的钢铁工业的基本建设工作。由于我国长期在帝国主义压榨下，当时我国钢铁工业带有严重的半殖民地的烙印，不仅设备陈旧和工人劳动条件极坏，而且钢铁工业内部极不平衡，钢铁工业的布局也极不合理。帝国主义为了便于剥夺原料和倾销成品，我国铁矿生产的数量远远超过炼铁炼钢能力，轧钢能力在数量、品种上更是少得可怜。帝国主义为了便于控制、便于运输、便于利用人口众多的沿海地区的劳动力，所以钢铁企业都摆在沿海地区。这些，当然完全不适应我国社会主义建设的需要。我们钢铁工业的基本建设，首先必须从根本上铲除历史上所遗留下的疮痍，按照我国资源分布和发展需要，合理地建立起我国有近代化装备的完整体系的钢铁工业。为了这个目的，第一个五年计划期间，我们不仅扩建了鞍山钢铁公司和重庆、大冶、太原几个钢铁厂，并且在长江中游的武汉和西北的包头，布下了两个大钢铁基地。从此，我国钢铁工业就沿着我们党所指示的方向，大踏步地前进。
    当我们刚开始大规模建设我国钢铁工业的时候，国外帝国主义分子和国内仇视社会主义的分子，都认为我们既无力量又无本领进行这样大规模的建设。他们把希望寄托在我们建设的失败上。但是历史的车轮完全向着他们希望的相反方向前进。在第一个五年计划期间，我们基本上建成了鞍山钢铁基地；开始了武汉和包头两个新的基地的建设；同时还新建和扩建了几十个中、小型的钢铁厂。旧有的钢铁厂也经过了技术改造，提高了技术装备水平。这样在第一个五年计划期间，我国钢产量从1952年的一百三十五万吨，提高到了五百三十五万吨，平均每年增长31.7％。这个期间，资本主义国家钢铁生产增长较快的如日本、意大利等国，每年也不过平均增长10％多一点，远远落在我们增长速度的后面。第一个五年计划最后一年的1957年，我国钢铁产量在世界的地位，又从1952年第十八位上升到第九位。事实证明，我国钢铁工业的发展，不但在恢复时期是高速度，就是在第一个五年计划大规模建设时期，仍然是高速度。
    1958年，我国开始了第二个五年计划。我国钢铁工业应当以怎样的速度向前发展的问题，摆在我们面前。这时有人出来说话了。他们说，第一个五年计划钢铁工业基础小，发展的速度显得快一些，第二个五年计划时期的基础大了，再保持高速度，是不可能的，到1962年生产九百万吨钢就差不多了。但是我们党的代表大会没有采纳这些人的意见，在1956年拟定第二个五年计划草案的时候，就提出了1962年要生产一千二百万吨钢的方案。早在1956年春毛主席就提出了社会主义建设中的“十大关系”的方针指示：提出了我国有五亿农民，必须发展和提高农业生产和轻工业生产，为了发展、提高农业、轻工业，需要重工业大力支援农业，实现农业的技术改造，这种大力发展农业、轻工业的道路，也正是促进重工业迅速发展的道路；1958年党中央和毛主席又提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和两条腿走路的方针；接着又提出以钢为纲全面跃进的口号和1958年钢产量翻一番的伟大号召。从此，全国人民在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的正确方针指导下，掀起了一个历史上从未有过的大办钢铁的群众运动。这样，就又给我国钢铁工业的发展开辟了一个新的速度。1958年一年，我国钢产量从五百三十五万吨提高到了一千一百零八万吨。即使除掉土钢不计，近代设备生产的八百万吨钢，比1957年也增长了二百六十五万吨，增长速度是49.5％。这一年我们所跨过的距离，在资本主义国家里，美国用了六年，英国用了十一年，德国用了五年，日本用了十八年。这一年我们又甩掉了两个国家，在世界各国钢铁产量上，从第九位上升到了第七位。这就是我国创造的一个新的发展速度。
    帝国主义仇视我们的大跃进，拼命诅咒我们的大跃进，国内仇视社会主义的分子，也害怕大跃进。他们和帝国主义一唱一和，说什么我们大跃进失败了。一小部分右倾机会主义分子，也在到处搜集跃进当中不可避免的一些暂时的、局部的缺点，攻击大跃进。国外的帝国主义、国内的社会主义敌对分子和右倾机会主义分子，他们反对大跃进的出发点虽然不完全一样，但是他们都希望我们抛弃总路线，不再搞大跃进，他们企求我们的社会主义建设停顿不前，或者慢慢来。全国人民在党和毛主席领导下，反驳了各色各样的诬蔑，批判了右倾机会主义的观点，万众一心，坚持总路线，坚持大跃进，提出今年要完成第二个五年计划最后一年的一千二百万吨钢指标的战斗口号。从八百万吨到一千二百万吨，一年增加四百万吨，速度是增长50％，这就又将超过大跃进第一年（1958年）的速度。
    我国革命胜利以来，从钢铁发展过程中可以清楚地看到，十年当中我国钢铁工业始终在高速度发展。恢复时期是高速度，第一个五年计划期间是高速度，1958年大跃进以来又进入另一个更高的速度。这样连续十年的高速度，而且在产量基础到了五百万吨以后，创造了更高的速度，这是历史上从来没有过的。十年来我们每年钢的平均增长速度，包括土钢在内是60.5％，土钢不计算在内则是54.5％。同时期资本主义国家钢产量增长的速度，美国是1％，英国是2.6％，法国是5.4％，西德是10.2％，意大利是13.1％，日本是16.3％。我们的速度与这些资本主义国家的速度相比，不正说明我国所创造的速度是一个历史的奇迹吗？也正是这种奇迹充分地说明了我国人民在我们党和毛主席英明领导下，十年来的成就，是多么辉煌，多么伟大。
            大跃进的伟大收获
    1958年是伟大的一年。这一年在党的总路线光辉照耀下，我国的政治、经济、文化、科学、教育、思想各个战线上都在大跃进，我国钢铁工业在大跃进的年代中，各方面都取得了辉煌的成就。目前大跃进的形势仍在继续发展，钢铁工业的增长正在以更高的速度进行。虽然大跃进的时间只有一年多，现在尚不可能全面的总结钢铁工业在大跃进中各方面的成就。但是从表现在我们眼前的事实来看，已经可以看出以下几方面有重大意义的事。
    第一，一年来钢铁工业大跃进的结果，把我国钢铁工业的发展速度提到一个新的阶段。前面曾经讲过，1958年的大跃进，我国钢铁工业的发展速度，以全部钢产量计算增长107％，以洋钢计算增长49.5％，1959年的继续大跃进，钢产量又将比1958年增长50％。这两年的增长速度，远远超过第一个五年计划每年平均增长31.7％的速度。这一个铁的事实，从根本上粉碎了那些第二个五年计划钢铁的增长速度不可能超过第一个五年计划啦，基数越大增长速度越慢啦等等似是而非的论点，证明了我们党从七届二中全会就提出、八届二次大会再次强调的我国社会主义建设能够而且应该是高速度的理论是完全正确。在大跃进以前，对我国钢铁工业发展速度问题，是存在不同认识的。有一种人，从速度递减论出发，认为我们第一个五年计划时期的高速度是一个暂时现象，第二个五年计划时的基础大了，不可能保持像第一个五年计划那样的速度。他们主张把第二个五年计划钢产量指标定低些。另一种意见认为：根据党的高速度建设社会主义的理论，指出像我国这样一个六亿五千万人口的“一穷二白”的国家，必须尽快地发展钢铁工业，才能适应加速发展社会主义建设的需要，而且农业和轻工业向重工业提出了要求，它们开辟了重工业广阔发展的前途。他们认为今后一个相当长的时间里，尽管钢铁的基数加大了，但是增长速度可以不是递减的，因为第一个五年计划所达到的速度，不是一个极限；根据我国许多有利因素，第二个五年计划钢铁工业的增长速度，不仅可以争取不低于前一个五年计划，而且可能争取超过前一个五年计划。
    钢铁大跃进的事实证明，我国能够根据我国具体条件，创造自己的高速度。大跃进的实践解决了这个问题，是有伟大意义的。因为钢铁工业高速度的发展，决不只是钢铁工业本身的事情，钢铁工业发展快了，必然促进其他工业和交通运输业发展速度的加快。正如农业发展速度的提高会促进工业发展速度一样，钢铁工业高速度的发展，也必然会促进整个社会主义建设速度的加快。
    第二，在钢铁工业大跃进过程中出现的“小洋群”，一开始就显示了它的旺盛的生命力。它不但使我国在一年之内增加了巨大的钢铁生产能力，而且证明了党的大型企业与中小型企业同时并举、土法生产与洋法生产同时并举，中央工业与地方工业同时并举的方针，是高速度发展我国钢铁工业以至所有工业的道路。1958年大办钢铁工业的群众运动中，在大洋群之外，开辟了一个从“小土群”到“小洋群”的战线。仅仅一年的工夫，这条战线就结出了丰硕的果实，增加了生产能力一千万吨以上的中、小高炉；生产能力七百万吨以上的中小转炉，和许多中小型矿山、小洋焦炉和小土焦炉。有了这些小洋群，我国钢的产量，在今后就可以继续不断地向前跃进，这对我们有极为重大的意义。
    这里我们不能不回忆到，当我们党根据我国条件，提出大中小企业同时并举的方针时，有些人是想不通的，他们机械地搬用外国的经验，认为钢铁企业越大越合理，他们反对搞中、小型的钢铁企业，说什么小高炉也能算一个“行道”吗？建设许多小企业将成为“包袱”，背不了放下，会造成将来的被动。在他们的眼光里，只有鞍钢、武钢、包钢这样的企业，才是真正的“行道”，“小洋群”是要不得的。但是大办钢铁的群众运动，根据党的两条腿走路的方针，在一年的时间内，建起这样多的小洋群，增加了巨大的生产能力，一下子把我国钢铁工业的建设速度和生产水平，提到一个新的高度，并奠定了今后继续大跃进的基础。事实证明“小洋群”不是包袱，而是宝贝，这是一个党的政策的胜利。这一胜利的出现，解决了许多人对“小洋群”、也就是对党的两条腿走路方针的怀疑。使大家清楚地看到，两条腿走路是高速度发展我国钢铁工业的正确道路。没有“小洋群”，我国钢铁工业的发展就根本不可能有这样高的速度。这个问题的解决，对我国钢铁工业今后的发展，将具有重大作用。
    第三，一年来的大跃进，开始正确地解决了我国钢铁工业的布局问题，大大改变了我国钢铁工业的面貌。旧中国所遗留下的带有半殖民地烙印的我国钢铁工业，经过三年恢复和第一个五年计划期间的努力，虽有重大的改变，但布局不合理的问题没有得到根本解决。到1957年底，我国内地钢铁生产的数量还很少，还有许多人口众多、资源丰富的省像山东、河南、湖南、广东、浙江、江西、广西等，根本不能生产钢铁，或者只生产很少数量的钢铁。全国大多数省，用一吨钢材，都要从鞍钢或上海运去。像我国这样的国家，钢铁工业的布局，是有战略意义的。不彻底解决这个问题，对国家的安全和国民经济的发展，都有严重的影响。在过去，有些人把解决这个问题看作是一件非常困难的事情，一提到钢铁工业的合理布局，总是想到这是十年或二十年以后的事情。但是这个被人认为困难的问题，在大办钢铁的群众运动中，只一年的工夫，就开始找到了解决的捷径。现在除了西藏以外，所有的省、自治区，除了都拥有几个、几十个炼铁小洋群以外，还都在建设一个、两个和两个以上的中小型钢铁厂。除了西藏以外，所有省、自治区都将生产大量的生铁；除了少数几个省、自治区以外，都将生产几万吨、十几万吨甚至几十万吨的钢。山东就是一个最好的例子，一年以前，山东省还是一个钢铁工业的空白地区，经过一年，情况大变，省内炼铁炼钢的基点星罗棋布，今年将生产一百三十多万吨生铁，十六万多吨钢，比1949年全国钢的总产量还多几千吨，比那时全国生铁的总产量多四倍。在地图上看我国钢铁的面貌，过去只有集中在少数几个省的钢铁企业，现在已经开始分散到全国了。这个变化对发展各省、自治区工农业生产有重大意义。我国是一个地区辽阔，人口众多的国家，非常需要建立地方性的钢铁工业，以满足地方经济发展的需要。现在这个全国范围内的钢铁网已经布开了，再经过二三年的努力，各省、自治区都将有比较完整生产系统的钢铁工业。毫无疑问，这一点对我国整个社会主义建设是有重大的作用的，而且这个作用在今后将会越来越明显。
    第四，在钢铁工业大跃进中，广大职工响应毛主席号召，解放思想破除迷信，敢想敢说敢做，在很短的期间内，把我国钢铁工业的技术水平，提到了一个新的高度。过去，我国钢铁工业的技术水平是落后的。经过第一个五年计划期间的努力，在苏联专家的帮助下，有了很大的提高。但从总的方面讲，许多主要经济指标，还是比较落后。以大、中型高炉的利用系数为例，1952年全国平均只有一点零二三吨，1957年也不过一点三二一吨，当时世界最先进的高炉的利用系数已达到一点五吨左右。技术水平的落后，一方面固然和我们经验不足有关系，另一方面，也由于在思想领域内存在教条主义习气和形而上学的思想方法。在去年大跃进中，广大职工解放思想、破除迷信，冲击了形而上学的观点，立即形成了一个技术革命的高潮，许多旧的技术公式被推翻，大量新的发明创造涌现出来，在技术方面出现了新的局面。主要的技术经济指标，跃进到了世界先进的行列。例如，大中型高炉的利用系数，过去许多技术人员认为不可能或不可能在短期内达到二吨，但是去年9月本溪第一炼铁厂的高炉就开始突破二吨的大关，以后一直在继续上升，今年第二季度已经达到二点三八二吨；太原钢铁公司的一高炉、鞍山钢铁公司的三、九号大高炉，也先后突破二吨大关。在平炉方面，上钢三厂的小型平炉，利用系数达到十四吨，鞍钢大平炉超过了九吨；这都是目前世界上的先进纪录。新的碱性转炉炼钢的方法、新的耐火砖烧成方法，也由群众创造出来了，科学研究人员原准备用几年时间，根据我国资源建立我国合金钢系统的问题，在一年的时间内就基本上解决了。这些成果的综合，就把我国钢铁工业的技术水平，提高到一个新的阶段。
    这种从破除迷信，解放思想开始的技术革命、技术革新运动，对我们是非常有意义的。它长了我们的志气，使广大职工敢于冲破旧的经验和公式的束缚，敢于向陈旧的东西挑战，敢于创造新的理论、新的公式。由于冲破了技术神秘观点，使技术走出技术人员的圈圈，成为广大群众研究的课题，这就使我们技术战线出现生动活泼和繁荣的局面。在这个基础上，我们就更有信心、更有勇气地向技术高峰进军。
    第五，在大办钢铁工业的群众运动中，钢铁工业的基本建设也取得了一系列的革命性的胜利，特别是缩短建设工期和节约资金尤为显著。过去一提到钢铁工业基本建设的时间，总是以“年”作为计算单位。设计一个钢铁厂，就要两年的时间，建设一座大高炉就要一年的时间，建设一个平炉车间，就要一年半的时间，建设一个联合企业，就要五、六年时间。但是去年大跃进，大家鼓足干劲、力争上游，破除了工期方面的迷信，许多工程的建设进度，都加快了，而且不是加快一点，而是加快一倍。例如鞍钢的大型高炉，只用了五个月不到的时间就建成了，而过去建设这样的大型高炉，却需要一年的时间。上海一个大型炼钢车间，不到二个月就建成了，过去同样的工程，要半年以上。这样，在建设速度的观念上，就起了一个革命。
    在钢铁基本建设投资上，一方面由于设计人员思想解放，开始能够根据中国的具体情况，因地制宜地进行设计。另一方面，因为建设工期的加快，建筑安装新技术的创造和推广，大大节约了基本建设投资。同样的工程，大跃进以后，比大跃进以前大约节约资金三分之一左右。像这样工期快一倍，投资节约三分之一，在过去没有人去想，也没有人敢想的大事，在大办钢铁运动中，群众不但想出来，而且也干出来了。
    第六，在钢铁工业大跃进中，还有一个伟大的收获，就是找到了办工业的一个最根本的方法——群众运动的路线。过去，在进行革命斗争的时候，大家都懂得通过群众运动，实现革命的目的。但是到了建设时期办工业的时候，却以为工业技术复杂，生产紧张，要求统一指挥，因而只能靠从上而下的规章制度和行政命令办事，不能搞群众运动了。好像群众起来会给企业造成什么“乱子”似的。结果，有一个时期，在工业战线上，把党的群众路线的优良传统抛在脑后了。看重了物的力量，看轻了人的力量。去年在大跃进中，改变了过去办工业的方法，根据毛主席的指示，大搞群众运动，钢铁工业从中小企业到大型联合企业，群众运动轰轰烈烈的开展起来。在群众运动中，干部、技术人员和工人打成了一片，同心协力搞好生产。在群众运动中，工人阶级的创造和智慧大大地发挥出来；许多束缚生产力发展的陈规旧律破除了；许多困难在群众运动的威力下迎刃而解；企业面貌立即改观，生产蒸蒸日上。同样的设备，在群众运动起来以后，生产能力有的比过去提高三分之一，有的提高二分之一，有的提高一倍，企业的潜力大大地发挥出来了。总之，大搞群众运动的结果，使钢铁工业出现了一个全新的局面。在大跃进中解决了在工业企业里能否大搞群众运动，这对我们办好社会主义工业，确立企业管理的正确的制度，发挥社会主义工业威力，是有不可估量的意义的。对待群众运动的态度，是我们能否大跃进，能否贯彻执行总路线的关键。
    在钢铁工业的大跃进中，由于我们缺乏经验，也产生一些缺点，例如有一个时期劳动使用过多，有些小高炉和小转炉，还存在成本较高；质量较差的缺点。但是所有这些缺点，有的已经解决，有的正在解决。就其性质来讲，都是局部的和暂时的缺点，许多是新生事物在它的生长过程中，难于避免的缺点，这和获得的伟大成绩比较，只能是九个指头与一个指头的问题。
              向新的胜利迈进
    我党中央八届八中全会向全国钢铁战线上的职工提出了一个伟大任务：在今年内完成原订第二个五年计划最后一年——1962年的指标。全国几百万钢铁大军立即响应了党的这个伟大号召。我国最大的钢铁基地鞍山，提出保证提前十天完成全年钢的计划；另一个大的钢铁基地上海的钢铁工人，决心保证超额完成今年钢的生产计划。从天山到东海滨，从黑龙江到海南岛，所有钢铁企业职工正满怀信心地为超额完成一千二百万吨钢而奋斗。
    现在我们钢铁战线的形势，是在去年大跃进的基础上继续大跃进的形势。进入8月以来，广大职工响应了党的反右倾鼓干劲的号召，掀起了新的生产高潮。因此可以肯定地说，胜利地超额完成一千二百万吨钢，是有把握实现的。
    在党中央和毛主席领导下，有总路线指示我们前进方向，有以苏联为首的社会主义国家的帮助，只要我们不骄不躁，实行政治挂帅，继续不断地解放思想、破除迷信，大搞群众运动，我国钢铁工业一定会不断地大跃进，从胜利走向胜利。党交给我们的在十年内赶上英国的任务，我们一定坚决争取提前实现。（附图片）
