Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 20th - According to today's "Al Nida" newspaper, a local committee to protect Helou has recently been established in Beirut. The committee issued its first appeal, demanding that the United Arab Republic authorities immediately release Helou.
    
"Al Nida" said that after a long period of not receiving any news about Helou, people are increasingly worried and uneasy about the life of this great Lebanese leader. A group of Lebanese nationalists formed this local committee after visiting each other in Beirut. In its first appeal, the committee said, "We, a group of Lebanese people in Beirut, believe it is necessary to organize a committee to protect Helou, to save Helou, so that he can continue to carry out the national struggle for the benefit of Lebanon and the Arab cause."
    
The appeal condemned the illegal arrest of Helou by the United Arab Republic authorities. The appeal pointed out that arresting a person, hiding him in a dark prison, and cruelly torturing him violates the principles of the Declaration of Human Rights.
    
The appeal then demanded that the Syrian authorities of the United Arab Republic release this great Lebanese compatriot, or transfer him to court if he is accused of any crime.
    
The appeal also requested that the Lebanese authorities continue to contact the United Arab Republic authorities in Damascus to save the life of this Lebanese citizen and secure his release.
    
The committee called on the Lebanese people to organize local committees throughout Lebanon to protect Helou. The committee further stated in the appeal, "We are deeply convinced that the surging voice of the people's movement will促成Helou's release."
    
The appeal was signed by a group of Lebanese patriotic individuals in Beirut, including engineers, doctors, athletes, lawyers, businessmen, writers, university students, poets, etc.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 19th - According to today's "Al Nida" newspaper, Lebanese Minister of Public Works, Jemayel, confirmed here that the leader of the Lebanese Communist Party, Farajallah Helou, is still being detained in Damascus.
    
The newspaper said that Jemayel confirmed this to Helou's wife, two daughters, and brother when they visited the minister to inquire about the government's efforts to save Helou.
    
"Al Nida" has continued to publish letters and telegrams from people around the world demanding the immediate release of Helou for several days. Today, "Al Nida" published a petition signed by 1,661 residents of the Maqdad and Karada Sharqiya districts of Baghdad and employees of the Public Health Bureau of the Iraqi Ministry of Health. They believe that the abduction and torture of Helou by the United Arab Republic authorities is a "blatant violation of the most basic democratic principles and human rights." In their petition, they said, "We strongly condemn these barbaric actions and demand his immediate release."

    要求阿联立即释放黎共领袖
    黎巴嫩公众成立保卫赫卢委员会
    黎官员证实赫卢仍被关在大马士革狱中
    新华社贝鲁特20日电　据今天的“呼声报”报道，保卫赫卢地方委员会新近在贝鲁特成立。委员会发出了第一份呼吁书，要求阿联当局立即释放赫卢。
      “呼声报”说，在长时期没有获得关于赫卢的音讯后，人们对于这位伟大的黎巴嫩领袖的生命愈来愈感到担心和不安，一批黎巴嫩民族主义者在贝鲁特市内彼此访问后，就组成这个地方委员会。这个委员会在它的第一份呼吁书中说，“我们，在贝鲁特的一群黎巴嫩人，认为有必要组织一个委员会来保卫赫卢、拯救赫卢以便使他继续能为黎巴嫩和阿拉伯人的事业的利益进行民族斗争。”
    呼吁书谴责阿联当局非法逮捕赫卢，呼吁书指出，逮捕一个人，将他藏在黑暗的监狱中并且残酷地加以拷问，是违反人权宣言的原则的。
    呼吁书接着要求阿联的叙利亚当局释放这位伟大的黎巴嫩同胞，或者将他移送法院，如果他被控有任何罪名的话。
    呼吁书还要求黎巴嫩当局继续同大马士革的阿联当局接触，以挽救这位黎巴嫩公民的性命和使他获释。
    这个委员会呼吁黎巴嫩人在黎巴嫩各地组织地方委员会来保卫赫卢，委员会在呼吁书中又说，“我们深信，人民运动鼎沸的声音将促成赫卢的获释。”
    呼吁书是由贝鲁特的一群黎巴嫩爱国志士签名的，他们包括工程师、医师、体育家、律师、商人、作家、大学生、诗人等。
    据新华社贝鲁特19日电　据“呼声报”今天报道，黎巴嫩公共工程部长杰马耶勒在这里证实，黎巴嫩共产党领袖法拉贾拉·赫卢仍然被拘留在大马士革。
    报纸说，当赫卢夫人、赫卢的两个女儿和兄弟访问这位部长，向他探询关于政府拯救赫卢的消息时，杰马耶勒向他们证实了这一点。
    “呼声报”几天来继续刊登世界各地人民要求立即释放赫卢的来信和电报。“呼声报”今天刊登了巴格达的马克达迪和卡拉达沙基区居民以及伊拉克卫生部公共卫生局职工一千六百六十一人签名的请愿书。他们认为阿联当局绑架和拷问赫卢是“公然破坏最起码的民主原则和人权”。他们在请愿书中说，“我们强烈地谴责这些野蛮的行动并且要求立即释放他”。
