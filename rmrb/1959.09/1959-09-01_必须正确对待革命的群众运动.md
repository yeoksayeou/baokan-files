    Our country and people are advancing bravely along the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. Life powerfully demonstrates that this general line is the most concentrated and scientific expression of the thoughts, feelings, desires, demands, creative abilities, and wisdom of China's 650 million people to build our country into a great socialist nation. Under its call and guidance, a glorious and brilliant 1958, unprecedented in our country's history, emerged. In this great year, not only did a new situation of great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production and great development in culture and science appear, but also people's communes, like the rising sun, fully in line with the laws of historical development and full of powerful vitality, emerged. 1959 is continuing to leap forward on the basis of 1958. The people's communes have already embarked on a path of consolidation and sound development, and industry and agriculture have also seen new growth and development. This growth and development has created a new foundation for us to continue to leap forward. As the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee pointed out: "Based on the achievements already obtained last year and in the first half of this year, it is entirely possible to complete the main targets originally planned for the last year (1962) of the Second Five-Year Plan in terms of major industrial and agricultural products this year. We should take the early completion of the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan as the basic task for this year. This is a glorious and great task. The completion of this task will bring our national economy to a new and higher level." History has proven and will continue to prove that 1958 and 1959 are years of great significance in the development of our socialist cause and will be recorded in our history with a prominent position.
    We are used to and not surprised by the voices of domestic and foreign reactionaries cursing us because of our victories. How could our victories not provoke the enemy's rabid barking?
    Revolution is the cause of the masses, revolution is continuous, and revolutionary mass movements are also continuous; revolution needs revolutionary mass movements, and so does construction.
    What deserves our serious attention is a small handful of right-leaning opportunists who have appeared within our Party. They also call themselves revolutionaries, but they have once again been frightened by the victory of the revolution. They underestimate the great achievements made by hundreds of millions of working people and revolutionary activists in the Great Leap Forward movement and the people's commune movement, while they overestimate the shortcomings that arose from lack of experience in these two movements and have already been overcome. They slander the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, which were carried out enthusiastically by hundreds of millions of working people under the leadership of the Party, as a "petty-bourgeois feverish movement." This forces us to engage in debate with the right-leaning opportunists. This is a debate of principle, involving a series of theoretical issues, the most important of which is a fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism, namely, how proletarian revolutionaries should treat revolutionary mass movements, which is one of the most important hallmarks distinguishing bourgeois revolutionaries from proletarian revolutionaries.
    Revolution is the locomotive of history, a principle first uttered by Marx and then repeatedly repeated by Lenin, which has been increasingly developed and enriched with new content over the past century, especially the past half-century. It proves that: revolution is the cause of the masses, revolution is continuous, and revolutionary mass movements are also continuous. Continuous revolution and continuous mass movements exist not only in the class struggles of class societies, not only in democratic revolutions and socialist revolutions, but also in the infinite historical development after the elimination of classes. This truth has been fully confirmed by our country's democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and it has made us increasingly aware that socialist revolution is a revolutionary movement, and socialist construction is also a revolutionary movement. Revolution needs revolutionary mass movements, and so does construction, and it needs increasingly large revolutionary mass movements. This is our worldview, our view of revolution, and our view of mass movements. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly taught us. The misfortune of the right-leaning opportunists within the Party lies in the fact that they have forgotten these "important words and wonderful principles" of Marxism-Leninism and have revered the bourgeois metaphysical empiricism and egoistic worldview as sacred; this cannot but lead them to a tragic end.
    Marx and Engels were the first proletarian revolutionaries in human history. Based on the dialectical materialist worldview, they created the most scientific historical materialism for the first time. In their jointly authored "The Holy Family" in their youth, they thoroughly criticized the reactionary views of the Bauer brothers①, who slandered the people as passive and inert matter, and revealed the truth that "historical deeds and thoughts are the deeds and thoughts of the masses;" and predicted that "historical activity is the cause of the masses, and as historical activity deepens, the scope of the masses will inevitably expand." In the first document announcing his genius worldview, "Theses on Feuerbach," Marx pointed out that the task of philosophers is not only to explain the world, but more importantly to transform the world. He enthusiastically placed the historical task of transforming the capitalist world on the proletariat, and therefore in the "Communist Manifesto," co-authored by him and Engels, he issued the earth-shaking cry of "Workers of all countries, unite!" In this way, Marx and Engels left their predecessors and contemporaries far behind and raised high the great banner of relying on the broad masses of the proletariat to carry out the proletarian revolution in human history. The great Lenin was the genius successor to this banner. Comrade Mao Zedong also often tells us: "The people, and the people alone, are the driving force in creating world history."
    All proletarian revolutionaries especially value the historical initiative of the masses and treat revolutionary mass movements with great enthusiasm. Bourgeois revolutionaries are fundamentally the opposite.
    Therefore, since Marx, all proletarian revolutionaries, without exception, have paid special attention to the historical initiative of the masses. In their lifelong activities, Marx and Engels always placed the historical initiative of the masses in the primary position, as the fundamental starting point for guiding revolution and developing theory. Marx's attitude towards the Paris Commune is even more prominent and exciting because of the specific historical conditions in which the Commune was situated. At that time, the conditions for the workers to immediately revolt were not yet ripe, and the leaders of the movement were Marx's adversaries, the Proudhonists and Blanquists②. For this reason, half a year before the uprising, in September 1870, Marx had warned the French workers that carrying out an uprising was an act of recklessness. However, when in March 1871, the French workers heroically and spontaneously stormed the French bourgeoisie with an earth-shaking struggle, Marx did not in the slightest admonish the members of the Paris Commune. On the contrary, although he was far away in London, he showed great attention to this movement with the attitude of a person who had personally participated in this great event. In his famous letter to Kugelmann, he wrote: "Look at how much flexibility, how much historical initiative, and how much self-sacrifice these Parisians are showing!" "There has never been such a heroic struggle in history." He also said: "In any case, the Paris uprising, even if it is suppressed by the jackals, swine, and despicable lackeys of the old society, is still the most glorious achievement of our party since the June uprising." When evaluating Marx's thorough proletarian revolutionary attitude towards the Paris Commune, Lenin said: "Marx attached the greatest importance to the historical initiative of the masses. It would be very good if all of us Russian Social Democrats had learned from Marx to assess the historical initiative shown by the Russian workers and peasants in October and December 1905!" "Marx knew how to warn the leaders not to carry out a premature uprising. But he treated the proletariat, who were determined to soar to the sky, with the qualifications of a practical counselor and the attitude of a participant in the mass struggle, because these masses, regardless of the absurd theories and mistakes of Blanqui and Proudhon, ultimately brought the entire movement to a higher stage." ("On Marx, Engels, and Marxism," pp. 172-173) Here, we cannot but see Lenin's steadfastness as a proletarian revolutionary towards the Russian Revolution of 1905. The Russian revolutions of October and December 1905 also ultimately suffered defeat, but Lenin, as a proletarian revolutionary, evaluated this revolutionary movement with the same revolutionary attitude as Marx evaluated the historical initiative of the Paris workers; and severely criticized Plekhanov's reactionary tune of "it was not necessary to use weapons." In his evaluation of the communist Saturday voluntary labor of the workers on the Moscow-Kazan Railway, Lenin also expressed a revolutionary attitude of enthusiastically praising and firmly supporting the historical initiative of the masses. Lenin called the Saturday voluntary labor a great initiative; a cell of the new socialist society that would free the people of all countries from the shackles of capital and the scourge of war. Lenin wrote a famous passage here: "The capitalist gentlemen and their lackeys, including those Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who are accustomed to calling themselves representatives of 'public opinion,' will of course ridicule the hopes of the Communists, calling these hopes 'planting large trees in small flower pots,' and ridicule the number of Saturday voluntary labor compared to the large number of cases of theft of public property, idleness, low productivity, damage to raw materials and products, etc., is negligible... Gloating over the difficulties and setbacks of the transition, spreading panic, and advocating turning back - all this is a tool and means for the bourgeois intellectuals to conduct class struggle. The proletariat will not allow itself to be deceived."
    Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of our Party, always infused this brilliant thought of Marx and Lenin into all his activities in guiding the Chinese revolution. In every important key period of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong always firmly grasped the historical initiative of the masses as the most fundamental starting point for observing the destiny of the country and determining the Party's program and line. In 1927, Comrade Mao Zedong's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," his 1956 writings on the issue of agricultural cooperation, and the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes, written under his guidance in 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong, like Marx and Lenin, highly evaluated the historical initiative of the people. I think that simply quoting a passage from "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" is enough to illustrate the problem. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "...the rise of the peasant movement at present is a very big issue. In a very short period of time, hundreds of millions of peasants will rise up from the central, southern, and northern provinces of China, with a force like a storm, swift and extraordinary, and no great force will be able to suppress it. They will break through all the nets that bind them and run swiftly towards the road of liberation. All imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry will be buried in their graves. All revolutionary parties and revolutionary comrades will be tested by them and decide whether to adopt or abandon them. Should they stand at the head of them and lead them? Or should they stand behind them and criticize them? Or should they stand opposite them and oppose them? Every Chinese has the freedom to choose from these three options, but the situation will force you to choose quickly." It is precisely because proletarian revolutionaries cherish the historical initiative of the people in this way, and regard the people as the creators of history and the subject of history in this way, that they always share the same breath, the same destiny, the same worries, and the same joys with the people, and live and struggle with the masses. Even when the revolutionary movement produces certain shortcomings and thus suffers setbacks, they never harbor resentment towards the people or hold a reproachful attitude, but humbly and calmly summarize the lessons of experience with the masses and turn them into revolutionary wealth to overcome shortcomings and turn defeat into victory. Obviously, in any historical period, whether it is a revolutionary period or a reactionary period, a revolutionary high tide or a low tide, firmly relying on the masses and firmly believing in the masses is one of the most essential characteristics of all proletarian revolutionaries.
    Bourgeois revolutionaries, on the other hand, are fundamentally the opposite. When they are still considered to be in revolution, it is only because of the needs of their temporary class interests that they have to use the masses and rely on the masses to carry out the revolution. But even so, as long as their revolution is progressive in a certain historical period, we also praise it. Marx and Engels therefore highly evaluated the French bourgeois revolution of the eighteenth century. However, we cannot but see that due to the instincts of the exploiting class and the limitations of narrow class interests, bourgeois revolutionaries, once the actions of the masses exceed what they consider to be the scope, they will try every means to deceive the masses, restrict the masses, curse the masses, and even take cruel measures to suppress the masses. Robespierre, a bourgeois revolutionary in eighteenth-century France, did just that. Robespierre, under the pressure of the workers and peasants of the lower National Convention, created the glorious situation of the Jacobin dictatorship. However, precisely when he was still under attack and pressure from the right-wing Girondist faction of the bourgeoisie, he turned around and opposed the struggle of the so-called "madmen" of the revolution. In 1927, when the Great Revolution was at its height, the Chinese bourgeoisie also stood with the feudal warlords, imperialists, and comprador forces to oppose the working class, peasants, and communists. These are all historical facts that have passed. And in some modern countries, a group of bourgeois revolutionaries have also emerged in national movements. When they fight against imperialism and feudalism, they have to borrow the strength of the workers and peasants, but as soon as they gain power and influence, they immediately turn their backs and refuse to recognize anyone, destroy the Communist Party, and massacre the workers and peasants. It is truly "yesterday's friend, today's enemy," "turning one's hand to make clouds and turning the other to make rain." Such figures, placed before the people of the world, are truly countless. Of course, it is impossible for these people to destroy the Communist Party and the people's struggle for liberation. But their behavior has another historical role, which is that the historical lessons of the eighteenth-century bourgeois revolution, which are easily forgotten, are once again brought to people's minds; especially for the education of the younger generation, such negative teachers are indispensable.
    On one side are proletarian revolutionaries, and on the other side are bourgeois revolutionaries. After centuries of revolutionary events, the images and spiritual outlook of the two sides have clearly pointed out the road to go to all revolutionaries. As communists, as communist fighters, it should be self-evident that we can only choose the path of proletarian revolutionaries between the two. However, history has shown that some bourgeois revolutionaries have transformed into proletarian revolutionaries; while within the ranks of the proletariat, some have degenerated into bourgeois revolutionaries, or wear the cloak of proletarian revolutionaries but are essentially still bourgeois revolutionaries, and even eventually become bourgeois revolutionaries. Was not the "famous" Kautsky? Was not the "famous" Plekhanov? Was not the "famous" Chen Duxiu in the history of the CCP? Yes, they were. These figures all mixed in the ranks of the proletariat for a while. But why did these people turn from revolutionaries of yesterday into traitors of today, and from "meritorious officials" of yesterday into culprits of today? What is the reason for this? I think that finding the true secret here and taking it as a warning is the fundamental reason why we must strictly distinguish between proletarian revolutionaries and bourgeois revolutionaries. There is an important lesson to be learned here: this is because these people have not established a thorough proletarian worldview and have not stood firm on the proletarian revolutionary stand. This wavering stand and vague worldview, at the critical juncture of the revolution, such as when the revolution suffers temporary setbacks or failures, that is, during the low tide of the revolution, or when the revolution is about to achieve a new victory, in these two periods, without exception, are the periods when the enemies of the revolution launch a frenzied attack, and these people waver. And history shows that the hallmark of this wavering, without exception, is first manifested in the attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement.
    The question of how to treat the revolutionary mass movement, like the question of the proletarian dictatorship that is closely related to it, is a touchstone for Marxism and anti-Marxism, and for true Marxists and false Marxists. Some people who call themselves proletarian revolutionaries but eventually degenerate into bourgeois revolutionaries have their fundamental reason in this.
    Right-leaning opportunists stand on the position of bourgeois revolutionaries to attack the revolutionary mass movement of our people building socialism; right-leaning opportunist thought is a reflection of bourgeois anti-socialist ideology within the Party.
    After we have analyzed the fundamental differences between proletarian revolutionaries and bourgeois revolutionaries, it is indeed an interesting issue to examine our country's real life.
    What is the situation in our country's real life? The general line formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong has penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people, the situation of the Great Leap Forward is changing rapidly, and the people's communes have embarked on a path of sound development. As the Eighth Plenary Session pointed out in its Resolution on Launching the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy, "The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes are the manifestations of the great determination and great wisdom of our country's hardworking and courageous 650 million people, and are the products of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of our Party and the people of all nationalities in our country, creatively combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the actual conditions of China." As early as April 15, 1958, that is, when this great new situation was just beginning to emerge, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his famous article "Introducing a Cooperative": "Never have I seen the masses of the people so spiritually uplifted, so full of fighting spirit, and so high-spirited." This prediction has been truly proven by the iron facts of the past year. In the Great Leap Forward, in the great steelmaking campaign, and in the people's commune movement, the spirit of the people across the country has become more and more uplifted, their fighting spirit has become more and more high-spirited, and their morale has become more and more vigorous. "Like thousands of troops and horses, they are invincible, and even high mountains must bow their heads, and rivers must give way." (Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session on Launching the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy) The French Revolution of 1871 and the Russian Revolution of 1905 were both failed revolutions, and Marx and Lenin still warmly cheered and praised the heroic actions of these revolutionary masses. Why, then, is the cheering and praising of our 1958 and 1959, which have achieved great victories, causing the shouts and laments of a small handful of right-leaning opportunists? What else can be said except that they are standing on the position of bourgeois revolutionaries?
    Here, we cannot easily forget the lessons of history. Whenever the Chinese revolution enters a new mass movement, there are always people who want to shout. During the Great Revolution, Chen Duxiu described the great peasant movement as "terrible." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the right-leaning opportunists ignored the power of the hundreds of millions of people who took to the anti-Japanese front under the call and mobilization of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and committed the shameful mistake of the capitulationist line. The mass movement to reduce rent and interest carried out in some areas of the North China Anti-Japanese Base Area before 1943 was repeatedly splashed with cold water by right-leaning opportunists, forming a situation of three ups and three downs. After the nationwide liberation, when land reform was carried out in the vast liberated areas, some people sang the tune of peaceful land reform and did not dare to boldly mobilize the masses. In 1956, agricultural cooperation had already formed a high tide of mass movement, and some people advocated resolutely contracting and learning to walk like a woman with bound feet. Just a little reflection can make us think that every time in these critical periods, there is always such a group of people who come out to shout and curse, and this seems to be a law.
    And what is wonderful is that these shouts and curses are, without exception, directed at the revolutionary mass movement. However, history proves that if we act according to their line, we will not be able to carry the democratic revolution through to the end, nor will we be able to carry out the socialist revolution. Today, some people have forgotten these historical lessons and are criticizing our country's new, historically unprecedented, broader, and more profound revolutionary mass movement to build socialism, and are calling the heroic actions of 600 million people turning the world upside down a "petty-bourgeois feverishness." This is simply a great insult to the people of our country. If we talk about petty-bourgeois feverishness, we cannot but think of the Party's "left"-leaning opportunist line in 1931-1934. It was ostensibly criticizing Comrade Li Lisan's "left"-leaning line, but in essence, it was a "left"-leaning opportunist line that was much more "left" and much more thorough than the Li Lisan line. This line did indeed thoroughly demonstrate petty-bourgeois feverishness. Look at the heroic actions of our Party and the people of the whole country under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong, what point is petty-bourgeois feverishness? What point is similar to the situation in 1931-1934? At that time, the "left"-leaning opportunist line caused painful losses to the Chinese revolution. Today, our general line is leading China's revolution and construction to unprecedented great victories. This is by no means petty-bourgeois feverishness, it precisely demonstrates the proletarian revolutionary steadfastness. It is precisely this steadfastness that demonstrates the noble spirit of the Chinese people. It is this noble spirit that permeates the whole of China that has created the great leap forward situation and gave birth to the people's commune, this new type of social grassroots organization. Has the transformation of Wang Guofan's "poor stick" cooperative into a well-fed and well-clothed people's commune been "petty-bourgeois feverishness?" We say that Wang Guofan and thousands upon thousands of Wang Guofan-style grassroots cadres are the ones who truly possess proletarian steadfastness and have the bones of the proletariat. Is the national campaign to make steel in a big way, with tens of millions of people going up the mountains, petty-bourgeois feverishness? We say that the heroes who develop small indigenous groups and gradually upgrade them into small foreign groups, and combine indigenous and foreign methods, are the ones who truly possess proletarian steadfastness and have the bones of the proletariat. Those who say that proletarian steadfastness is "petty-bourgeois feverishness" precisely show that they have bourgeois steadfastness, and they want to use bourgeois steadfastness to attack our proletarian steadfastness. And the result is that they force us to use proletarian steadfastness to crush their bourgeois steadfastness.
    We clearly see that only the continued development and continued victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes can thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the capitalist system and thoroughly change the individual economy, which, as Lenin said, is constantly breeding capitalist elements. Only the continued development and victory of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes can thoroughly eliminate classes. Their victory is a sign of the complete death of capitalism. Therefore, this is a serious class struggle. It is precisely at this point that the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes have touched the bourgeois kingdom in the depths of the souls of those comrades who have committed right-leaning opportunist errors, and touched their bourgeois steadfastness. Thus, they have risen up to scold people, shout, and pour cold water. This kind of shouting and pouring cold water is essentially the bourgeois agents within the Party faithfully carrying out the task of the bourgeoisie attacking the proletariat, and it is a reflection of the bourgeois anti-socialist ideology within the Party. The essence and serious significance of our political and theoretical debate with the right-leaning opportunists today lies here.
    The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes have caused capitalism to lose too much and socialism to gain too much; we should be overjoyed and cheer for these great achievements, and we should not be alarmed by the shortcomings in the movement.
    The right-leaning opportunists seize on certain shortcomings that we have already corrected or are correcting in our work, piece them together, and exaggerate them as capital for slander and attack. This is really too pitiful, but it is a principled issue in politics and theory. Can a revolution be without shortcomings? Can a revolution even be without errors? In the great leap forward of 1958, while achieving great achievements, there were indeed some shortcomings in the work. If there were no shortcomings, we would not need to rise up to correct them. But what do these shortcomings amount to compared to our achievements? In reality, it is only a relationship of one finger to nine fingers. The so-called nine fingers refer to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward and the birth of the people's communes created under the correct guidance of the general line. This is a great new thing, this is a new thing that determines the destiny of our country, and it is the fundamental symbol of the great Chinese people carrying the socialist revolution through to the end. The so-called one finger is just some shortcomings that arose when these new things were born, due to our and the masses' lack of experience, but some shortcomings are inevitable in any revolution due to lack of experience. Whoever is afraid of shortcomings should not do work, and whoever is afraid of mistakes should not engage in revolution. A new thing is always primitive, simple, and crude when it is first born, and it cannot reach a perfect state all at once. Giving birth to a small baby requires a little bleeding and cutting the umbilical cord. Could it be that the birth of such a great new thing as the great people's commune, and the emergence of such a great situation as the national leap forward, would not have any problems at all? Is it required that our work has no loopholes at all? This is clearly impossible. I ask: with the achievements of nine fingers and the shortcomings of one finger, will you not engage in revolution? What about the shortcomings of two fingers? What about the shortcomings of three fingers? Proletarian revolutionaries dare to say this: we will do it with a score of seven to three between achievements and shortcomings, and we will do it even with a score of six to four. Because after all, the gains outweigh the losses! Revolution is not embroidery, revolution is not talking about love on a moonlit and breezy night, but a heroic struggle of hundreds of millions of people like a raging wave. In the tide of revolution, some spray is splashed, hitting people's faces, and they shout in alarm. What is this so-called revolutionary if not a complete hypocrite? Still on the issue of the Paris Commune of 1871, when Marx criticized Kugelmann for expressing doubts about this great revolution, he wrote: "If the struggle were only to be started under conditions of extremely favorable chances, then indeed the making of world history would be a very easy thing." And after the failure of the Paris Commune, Marx said: "The revolution is dead, long live the revolution! Marx showed such great proletarian revolutionary steadfastness and spirit." Taking this as a lesson, the great achievements of our general line and the Great Leap Forward have exerted and are exerting infinite power, and our people's communes are showing their boundless vitality more and more strongly. In a word, our revolution is born, so why can't we cheer and shout long live the revolution?! What is the point of making a fuss about the slightest shortcomings produced in such a great revolutionary mass movement?! It is not difficult to see that the right-leaning opportunists have completely adopted the bourgeois gentlemanly attitude of the Russian capitalist gentlemen and their lackeys towards the communist voluntary labor Saturday for our country's Great Leap Forward and the people's communes. Here, please listen to Lenin's words:
    "If we look at the problem in essence, is there a new mode of production in history that has developed all at once without many failures and repeated errors? Half a century after the overthrow of the serf system, there are still many remnants of the serf system in the Russian countryside. Half a century after the abolition of the black slave system in the United States, the blacks there are often still in a state of semi-slavery. Bourgeois intellectuals, including Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, have always maintained the essence of serving capital and seized on extremely hypocritical arguments; before the proletarian revolution, they blamed us for being utopian, and after the revolution, they demanded that we eradicate the vestiges of the old system at a ridiculous speed!
    "But we are not utopians, we know the true value of bourgeois 'arguments', and we also know that the remnants of the old things must inevitably surpass the new seedlings in a certain period after the revolution. When new things are just born, old things are always stronger than new things for a considerable period. This is a common phenomenon in nature or social life. Ridiculing the weakness of new seedlings, holding a frivolous intellectual skepticism, etc. - all this is actually a means of class struggle by the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, protecting capitalism and opposing socialism. We should carefully study the new seedlings, treat them extremely carefully, try our best to help them grow, and 'take care' of these fragile seedlings." Moreover, the problem is that, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are very agile and quick in correcting their shortcomings in the advancement. That is to say, the people's communes and a series of new things in the Great Leap Forward are no longer fragile seedlings, but are rapidly becoming towering trees that have withstood the test of wind and frost.
    Another reason for the right-leaning opportunists to attack us is the so-called argument that the losses outweigh the gains and that the gains do not compensate for the losses. We must also severely refute this. Was the Great Leap Forward of 1958 a gain or a loss? Did the gains outweigh the losses, or did the losses outweigh the gains? Who lost more and who gained more? This is indeed a principled issue in politics and theory. We say that in 1958, the Chinese people did not have the problem of gains outweighing the losses, but rather gained too much, gained things that our ancestors had never gained since they established their business on this land. Check the history books to see, in which history book did the Chinese people produce more than 11.08 million tons of steel per year? Produced more than 500 billion jin of grain per year? Our ancestors fantasized about the world of great harmony in the "Li Yun," and it has been thousands of years since then, but only in 1958 did the best organizational form for the transition from socialism to communism in the future appear on our land - the great people's commune. How should this account of gains and losses be calculated? I say, it should be calculated like this: the bourgeoisie, the capitalist system, have lost too much, and the proletariat, the socialist system, have gained too much. This also reflects the truth that "the old does not go, the new does not come." They lost what they did not want to lose, and we gained what we should have gained. This is also the view of gains and losses of proletarian revolutionaries, that is, Marxism-Leninism. There is also an account that can be calculated: we have had some shortcomings, made some mistakes, wasted some grain and manpower, and some production targets were set too high. Is this considered a loss? Can it be said that the losses outweigh the gains? After criticism and self-criticism, the shortcomings and mistakes were overcome, so didn't our cadres and masses gain more? Didn't they gain some more precious and more valuable things? Marx and Engels were right to say that the proletarian revolution lost chains and won the whole world. This Marxist view of gains and losses is so used to observe the proletarian revolution, and it must also be so used to observe specific things in a certain period. We must adhere to this view of gains and losses in order to have more courage to move forward like breaking waves! The right-leaning opportunists seize on the phenomenon and abandon the essence; seize on sesame seeds and abandon watermelons; seize on one finger and want to chop off nine fingers. We must shout loudly to them: Comrades! Please stop. This cannot be chopped off! Doing so is welcomed by our enemies and opposed by the people.
    Right-leaning opportunists have fallen into the mire of bourgeois empiricism and egoism; we must fight to defend the Marxist-Leninist worldview.
    After we have strictly distinguished the two diametrically opposed positions and attitudes of proletarian politicians and bourgeois politicians towards the revolutionary movement of the masses, we must further expose the bourgeois worldview of the right-leaning opportunists that is opposed to the proletarian worldview. Lenin once pointed out: "The reason why Marx's doctrine is omnipotent is that it is correct. It is very complete and rigorous, giving people a complete worldview that is absolutely incompatible with any superstition, any reaction, and any thought that defends bourgeois oppression." This is very true. The reason why our great Marxist teachers have become outstanding proletarian revolutionaries is that they have always thoroughly implemented this omnipotent worldview in any historical period and in any historical event. They respect materialism, respect dialectics, and respect historical materialism, so they can regard the revolution as a grand festival for the masses of the people. They have always actively launched the masses, organized the masses, and supported the masses in the revolutionary storms, and have constantly summarized the lessons of experience in the mass movement, and have bravely and correctly guided the masses to continue to move forward. They have always been worthy of being great helmsmen in the revolutionary storms. On the contrary, the biggest failure of all opportunists and all bourgeois revolutionaries within the Party is that they have deviated from this omnipotent worldview. They only respect idealism, respect metaphysics, and respect historical idealism. This antagonism of worldviews reflects the antagonism of classes, and the antagonism of classes strengthens the antagonism of worldviews, which is an inevitable logic. What deserves our special attention is that the worldview of the right-leaning opportunists within the Party has now deeply fallen into the mire of bourgeois empiricism. The empiricism of the right-leaning opportunists, due to their egoistic characteristics, has become inextricably linked with subjective idealism. The so-called everything comes from my experience, that is, everything comes from my feelings, and everything in the objective world and objective existence is a composite of my feelings. Therefore, they do not recognize objective truth, and they do not recognize that practice is the criterion for testing truth. The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes are the greatest objective existence in our country, but under the domination of their subjective idealism, existence becomes non-existence, gains become losses, correctness becomes error, and light becomes darkness, thereby leading themselves to the extremely small and extremely despicable mire of egoism. If egoism is allowed to develop, it will inevitably lead to bourgeois utilitarianism and pragmatism. With bourgeois utilitarianism, there is no proletarian utilitarianism. With egoistic utilitarianism, there is no utilitarianism of the people. This is a life-and-death struggle in the worldview. Here, regardless of whether the right-leaning opportunists have systematically studied the philosophy of subjective idealism, the problem lies in the essence of their thinking.
    It is precisely here that it is explained that in order to defend the Party's general line and defend the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, we must at the same time fight to defend the Party's omnipotent worldview - dialectical materialism and historical materialism!
    Our achievements are extraordinarily great, our future is extraordinarily bright, let us hold the red flag of Mao Zedong even higher and advance bravely!

    ① The Bauer brothers were liberal thinkers in Germany in the 1830s and 1840s, and representatives of the right-wing bourgeois radicals in the Hegelian school. They negated the objective laws of society and the primary significance of the activities of the masses, believing that self-consciousness was a powerful historical creative force. They promoted personal worship, viewing the individual as higher than the people, and considered the proletariat and working people to be "mediocre masses" incapable of independent historical activity. Therefore, they criticized the bourgeois revolution of the eighteenth century and contrasted it with the bourgeois reforms advocated by the "rational" (i.e., exploiter) state.

    ② Among the members of the Paris Commune, there were a majority and a minority. The majority was composed of Blanquists, and the minority was mostly Proudhonists. Proudhon was one of the founders of anarchism. He fantasized about making small private ownership last forever, and criticized large capitalist ownership from the standpoint of the petty bourgeoisie. He opposed class struggle, the proletarian revolution, and the proletarian dictatorship. Blanquism was a faction in the French socialist movement headed by Louis Auguste Blanqui (1805-1881). The classic Marxist-Leninist writers considered Blanqui to be an outstanding revolutionary and supporter of socialism, but also criticized his sectarianism and conspiratorial activities. The Blanquists negated class struggle. They hoped to "liberate mankind from wage slavery not through the class struggle of

    必须正确对待革命的群众运动	孙定国
    我们的国家和人民，正在沿着党中央和毛泽东同志所制定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线奋勇前进。生活有力地表明：这条总路线是我国六亿五千万人民要把我国建成伟大的社会主义国家的思想、感情、愿望、要求以及创造能力和智慧的最集中和最科学的表现。在它的号召和指引之下，在我国出现了史无前例的光辉灿烂的1958年。在这个伟大的年头里，不仅出现了工农业生产大跃进和文化科学大发展的崭新局面，而且还出现了像东升的旭日一样，完全合乎历史发展规律、富有强大生命力的人民公社。1959年正在1958年的基础上继续跃进。人民公社已经迈上了巩固而健全发展的道路，工业和农业也都有了新的增长和发展。这个增长和发展，造成了我们继续跃进的新的基础。正如八届八中全会的公报所指出的：“根据去年和今年上半年已经获得的成就，在今年内，在工农业主要产品方面，提前完成原定第二个五年计划最后一年（1962年）完成的主要指标是完全可能的。应当把提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标作为今年的基本任务。这是一个光荣的伟大的任务。这个任务的完成，将使我国国民经济达到新的更高的水平。”历史已经证明而且还将要证明，1958年和1959年，是我国发展社会主义事业的有重大意义的年头，而将以显赫的地位载入我国史册。
    国内外反动派因为我们的胜利而咒骂我们的声音，这是我们听惯了的，不足为怪。我们的胜利，又怎能不引起敌人的狂吠呢？
    革命是群众的事业，革命是不断的，革命的群众运动也是不断的；革命需要革命的群众运动，建设也需要革命的群众运动
    值得我们严重注意的，是出现在我们党内的一小撮右倾机会主义分子。他们也自称为革命家，但却又一次地为革命的胜利吓倒了。他们对于几亿劳动人民和革命积极分子在大跃进运动和人民公社运动中取得的伟大成绩，估计过低，而对于这两个运动中由于经验不足而产生、并且已经克服的若干缺点，则估计得过于严重。他们对于在党的领导下几亿劳动人民轰轰烈烈进行的大跃进和人民公社运动，污蔑为“小资产阶级狂热性运动”。这就迫使我们不得不同右倾机会主义分子展开争论。这是一场原则性的争论，在这个争论中涉及了一系列的理论问题，而最重要的，是涉及到马克思列宁主义的一个根本原则问题，即无产阶级的革命家应该怎样对待革命的群众运动的问题，这是区分什么是资产阶级革命家、什么是无产阶级革命家的一个最重要的标志。
    革命是历史的火车头，这个首先为马克思所说出而后为列宁所一再重复过的原理，在一个世纪以来，特别是半个世纪以来，日益以崭新的内容发展着和丰富着。它证明了：革命是群众的事业，革命是不断的，革命的群众运动也是不断的。不断地革命和不断的群众运动，不仅存在于阶级社会的阶级搏斗之中，不仅存在于民主主义革命和社会主义革命之中，而且还存在于阶级消灭以后的无限的历史发展之中。这一真理被我国的民主革命运动和社会主义革命运动所完全证实了，而且使我们日益认识到社会主义革命是一种革命运动，社会主义建设也是一种革命运动。革命需要革命的群众运动，建设也需要革命的群众运动，而且需要越来越大的革命群众运动。这就是我们的世界观、革命观和群众运动观。这是毛泽东同志所反复教育我们的。党内的右倾机会主义分子的倒霉之处，就在于他们把马克思列宁主义这些“要言妙道”，忘得干干净净，而把资产阶级的形而上学的经验主义和唯我主义世界观奉为神圣；这就不能不使他们得到悲惨的结果。
    马克思和恩格斯是人类历史上首次出现的无产阶级革命家，他们以辩证唯物主义的世界观为依据，首次创制了最科学的历史唯物论。在他们青年时期合著的“神圣家族”一书中，即已彻底批判了诬蔑人民群众为消极的惰性的物质的鲍威尔兄弟①的反动观点，而揭示了：“历史的事业和思想，都是群众的事业和思想”的真理；并且预言道：“历史活动是群众的事业，随着历史活动的深入，必将是群众范围的扩大。”马克思在宣布他的天才的世界观的第一个文件——“费尔巴哈论纲”中，指出哲学家的任务，不只在于说明世界，而更重要的在于改造世界。他把改造资本主义世界的历史任务，热情地寄托在无产阶级身上，因此在他和恩格斯合著的“共产党宣言”中发出了“全世界无产者，联合起来！”的惊天动地的声音。马克思和恩格斯就是这样把他们以前的和同时代的人物远远抛到后边，而在人类历史上高高举起了依靠无产阶级广大群众进行无产阶级革命的伟大旗帜。伟大的列宁，是这个旗帜的天才继承者。毛泽东同志也经常告诉我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    所有无产阶级的革命家，都特别重视群众的历史首创精神，满腔热情地对待革命的群众运动。资产阶级革命家却与此根本相反
    因此，自马克思以来，所有无产阶级革命家，无例外地都特别重视群众的历史首创精神。马克思和恩格斯在他们的毕生活动中，总是把群众的历史首创精神放在首要地位，作为他们指导革命、发展理论的根本出发点。马克思对待巴黎公社的态度，因为公社所处的特定的历史条件而显得更为突出，更为激动人心。在当时，工人立刻起义的条件并不成熟，运动的领导者又是马克思的论敌蒲鲁东派和布朗基派②，为此，在起义之前半年，即1870年9月，马克思就曾经警告过法国工人，说实行起义是一种狂妄的举动。可是，当1871年3月，法国工人英勇地、自动地以翻天复地的斗争冲激着法国资产阶级的时候，马克思并没有丝毫训诫巴黎公社社员，相反，他虽远在伦敦，却以亲身参加这一伟大事变者的态度，对这个运动表示莫大的注意。他在给库格曼的那封著名的信中写道：“你看这些巴黎人是显出多大的灵活性，多大的历史首创精神，多大的自我牺牲的本事呵！”“历史上还没有过这样英勇奋斗的实例。”他还说：“不管怎样，巴黎起义即令它会被旧社会的豺狼、瘟猪和下贱的走狗们镇压下去，也还是我党从六月起义以来最光荣的功业。”列宁在评价马克思对巴黎公社所持的彻底的无产阶级革命家的态度时说：“马克思最重视的是群众底历史首创精神。要是我们俄国社会民主党人都向马克思领教来估计俄国工农群众在1905年10月和12月所表现的历史首创精神，那就很好了！”“马克思知道应如何警告首领们不要实行过早的起义。但他对于决心冲天的无产阶级却是用实际忠告人的资格，用群众斗争参加者的态度来看待，因为这些群众不顾布朗基和蒲鲁东两人底荒谬理论和错误，终究把全部运动提到了更高的阶段。”（“论马克思恩格斯及马克思主义”，第172—173页）在这里，我们同样不能不看到列宁对于俄国1905年革命所表现的无产阶级革命家的坚定性。俄国的1905年10月和12月的革命也是最后遭受了失败的，但是作为无产阶级革命家的列宁，正是和马克思评价巴黎工人的历史首创精神一样，以革命的态度评价了这个革命运动；而且严厉地批判了普列汉诺夫所唱的“本来是不需要动用武器”的反动调子。列宁在对莫斯科—喀山铁路工人共产主义星期六义务劳动的评价中，同样表现了对群众的历史首创精神热情歌颂和坚决支持的革命态度。列宁把星期六义务劳动称之为是一种伟大的创举；是使各国人民摆脱资本桎梏和战争惨祸的社会主义新社会的一个细胞。列宁在这里写了一段有名的话：“资本家老爷及其走狗，包括那些惯于自命为‘舆论’代表的孟什维克和社会革命党人在内，当然要讥笑共产党人的希望，称这种希望是‘小花盆里栽大树’，讥笑星期六义务劳动的次数同大量存在的盗窃公物、游手好闲、生产率低落、损毁原料和产品等等现象比较起来是微乎其微的。……对转变中的困难和挫折幸灾乐祸，散布惊慌情绪，宣传开倒车，——这一切是资产阶级知识分子进行阶级斗争的工具和手段。无产阶级是不会让自己受骗的。”
    我们党的领袖毛泽东同志总是把马克思和列宁的这一光辉的思想灌注到他指导中国革命的全部活动中。在中国革命的每一个重要关键时期，毛泽东同志都是紧紧抓住群众的历史首创精神，作为观察国家命运、决定党的纲领路线的最根本的出发点。1927年，毛泽东同志所写的“湖南农民运动考察报告”、1956年写的关于农业合作化问题、以及1958年在他指导下所写成的中共八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议，毛泽东同志都像马克思、列宁一样高度地评价了人民群众的历史首创精神。我想在这里只要转引“湖南农民运动考察报告”中的一段文章，就足以说明问题了。毛泽东同志说，“……目前农民运动的兴起是一个极大的问题。很短的时间内，将有几万万农民从中国中部、南部和北部各省起来，其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，无论什么大的力量都将压抑不住。他们将冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑。一切帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏、土豪劣绅，都将被他们葬入坟墓。一切革命的党派、革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？每个中国人对于这三项都有选择的自由，不过时局将强迫你迅速地选择罢了。”正是由于无产阶级革命家是这样珍视人民群众的历史首创精神，是这样把人民群众看作历史的创造者，历史的主体，所以他们始终和人民群众一起同呼吸、共命运、同忧患、共欢乐，和群众一起生活、一起斗争，即使在革命运动产生了某些缺点、并因而遭受挫折的时候，也从不对人民群众抱埋怨情绪，持斥责态度，而是虚心冷静地和群众一起总结经验教训，把它变成克服缺点、转败为胜的革命财富。显然，在任何历史时期，革命时期与反动时期，革命高潮时期与低潮时期，都紧紧地依靠群众，坚信群众，这是一切无产阶级革命家最本质的特征之一。
    资产阶级的革命家却与此根本相反。当他们还算是在革命的时候，也只是由于他们一时的阶级利益的需要才不得不利用群众、依靠群众来进行革命。但即使是这样，只要他们的革命在一定历史时期有进步性，我们也是加以称许的。马克思和恩格斯正因此而高度地评价了十八世纪的法国资产阶级革命。可是，我们也不能不看到资产阶级革命家由于剥削阶级的本能和狭隘的阶级利益的限制，一当群众的行动在他们认为是超出了范围的时候，他们就要想尽方法欺骗群众，限制群众，咒骂群众，一直到采取残酷的手段镇压群众。十八世纪法国资产阶级革命家罗伯斯庇尔③就是这样做的。罗伯斯庇尔由于下层国民公会工农群众的压力，造成光荣的雅各宾专政的局面，可是，也恰恰在他还受着资产阶级右翼吉伦特派的攻击和压力的时候，他还是回转头来反对了革命的所谓“疯人派”的斗争。1927年，大革命正当高潮的时候，中国的资产阶级也同封建军阀、帝国主义以及买办势力站在一起，反对工人阶级、农民和共产党人。这都是已经过去的历史事实了。而就在现代的某些国家，在民族运动中，也出现了一批资产阶级革命家，当他们和帝国主义和封建制度作斗争时，不得不借工农之力，而一当他们得权得势，就立刻翻脸不认人了，摧毁共产党，屠杀工农群众，真正是“昨日朋友今仇敌”，
  “翻手作云复手雨”。摆在全世界人民面前的这样的人物，真是历历可数。当然，这些人要摧毁共产党和人民的解放斗争，那是不可能的。但他们的这种行为却有另一种历史作用，那就是十八世纪资产阶级革命所容易被人忘记的历史教训，又重新使人记起；特别是对于青年一代的教育，是决不可缺少这样的反面教员的。
    一边是无产阶级的革命家，一边是资产阶级的革命家，二者的形象和精神面貌，经过两个世纪多少次的革命事变，对一切革命者鲜明地指出了何去何从的道路。作为共产党人，作为共产主义战士，在这两者中间只能选择无产阶级革命家的道路，这应该是不言而喻的了。可是，历史又表明：资产阶级的革命家转化为无产阶级革命家的有人；而在无产阶级队伍中蜕化为资产阶级革命家的，或披着无产阶级革命家的外衣，而在实质上还是资产阶级革命家的，以至于最终成为资产阶级革命家的，也大有人在。“鼎鼎大名”的考茨基不是吗？“鼎鼎大名”的普列汉诺夫不是吗？在中共党史上“鼎鼎大名”的陈独秀不是吗？都是的。这些人物都是在无产阶级队伍里混过一番的。可是，为什么这些人从昨日的革命家变成了今日的叛徒，昨天的“功臣”变成了今日的祸首？这是为了什么呢？我认为，从这里找到其中的真正妙窍而引以为戒，这就是我们所以要严格区分无产阶级革命家和资产阶级革命家的根本原因所在。在这里有一条重要教训值得人们领取：这就是由于这些人没有树立起彻底的无产阶级的世界观、没有站稳无产阶级的革命立场。这种动摇的立场和模糊的世界观，在革命的重大转变关头，例如在革命遭受了暂时的挫折或失败，即在革命低潮的时候，或者是革命即将取得新的胜利的高潮的时候，在这两种时期，无例外地都是革命的敌人疯狂进攻的时期，这些人们就动摇起来了。而历史表明：这种动摇的标志，又毫无例外地首先表现在对待群众的革命运动的态度上面。
    如何对待革命的群众运动这个问题，像和它紧密联系的无产阶级专政问题一样，是马克思主义和反马克思主义、真马克思主义者和假马克思主义者的试金石。一些号称为无产阶级革命家而终于堕落为资产阶级革命家的人，其根本原因即在于此。
    右倾机会主义分子站在资产阶级革命家的立场上，来攻击我国人民建设社会主义的革命的群众运动，右倾机会主义思想是资产阶级反社会主义思潮在党内的反映
    当我们分析了无产阶级革命家和资产阶级革命家的根本区别之后，再来考察我国的现实生活，的确是一个饶有兴趣的问题。
    我国的现实生活情况是怎样呢？党中央和毛泽东同志所制订的总路线已经深入人心，大跃进的形势一日千里，人民公社已经走上健全发展的道路。正如八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议所指出的，“总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是我国勤劳勇敢的六亿五千万人民的伟大决心和伟大智慧的表现，是我们党和我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国实际结合起来的产物。”早在1958年4月15日，也就是在这一个伟大的新局面刚刚露出苗头的时候，毛泽东同志在“介绍一个合作社”那篇著名的文章中，就曾经说过：“从来也没有看见人民群众像现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”这个预言切切实实地被一年多来的铁的事实所证明了，全国人民在大跃进中，在大炼钢铁中，在人民公社化运动中，精神越来越振奋，斗志越来越昂扬，意气越来越风发。“有如千军万马，所向无前，真是高山也要低头，河水也要让路。”（八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议）1871年的法国革命和1905年的俄国革命，都是失败了的革命，而马克思和列宁都还热烈地欢呼和歌颂了这些革命群众的英勇行动。为什么我们取得了伟大胜利的1958年和1959年，对它的欢呼和歌颂，反而引起一小撮右倾机会主义分子的喊叫和悲泣呢？这除开说明他们是站在资产阶级革命家的立场上，还有什么可说的呢？
    在这里我们不能轻易忘记历史的教训。每当中国革命进入新的群众运动的时候，总是有人要发出叫喊的声音。在大革命的时候，陈独秀曾把伟大的农民运动说成“糟得很”。抗日战争时期，右倾机会主义者曾无视在党中央和毛泽东同志的号召和动员下走上抗日战线的亿万人民的力量，而犯了可耻的投降主义的路线错误。华北抗日根据地某些地方在1943年以前进行的减租减息的群众运动，曾被右倾机会主义分子一再泼冷水，形成了三起三落的局面。全国解放后，在广大解放区进行土地改革的时候，又有人唱出和平土改的调子，而不敢放手发动群众。1956年，农业合作化已经形成了群众运动的高潮，又有人主张坚决收缩，学小脚女人走路。只要稍微回想一下，就可以想到：每当这些关键时期，总有这样一派人出来叫喊和咒骂，这好像是一条规律一样。
    而绝妙的是，这些叫喊和咒骂，无例外地都是针对着革命的群众运动。可是，历史证明，如果我们按照他们的路线办事，我们就无法把民主革命进行到底，也无法进行社会主义革命。今天竟有人忘记了这些历史教训，而非难我国新的、历史上空前的、更广阔、更深刻的建设社会主义的革命群众运动，并且把史无前例的六亿人民翻天复地的英雄行为名之曰“小资产阶级的狂热性”。这简直是对我国人民的极大侮辱。要是说起小资产阶级狂热性的话，不能不使我们想起党在1931—1934年的“左”倾机会主义路线。它美其名曰批判李立三同志的“左”倾路线，而在实质上是比立三路线更“左”得多、更彻底得多的“左”倾机会主义路线。这条路线确实彻头彻尾地表现了小资产阶级的狂热性。试看我们党和全国人民在毛泽东同志所制定的社会主义建设总路线指引下的英雄行动，有哪一点是小资产阶级的狂热？有哪一点类似于1931—1934年的情况？在当时，“左”倾机会主义的路线造成了中国革命惨痛的损失。在今天，我们的总路线把中国的革命和建设引向了空前的大胜利。这绝不是小资产阶级的狂热性，它恰恰表现了无产阶级的革命坚定性。正是这种坚定性，表现了中国人民的浩然正气。这种浩然正气弥漫了全中国，才造成了伟大的跃进局面，诞生了人民公社这种新型的社会基层组织。王国藩的“穷棒子”社一变而成为丰衣足食的人民公社，这是“小资产阶级的狂热性”吗？我们说，王国藩以及成千成万王国藩式的基层干部，才是真正具有无产阶级坚定性的、具有无产阶级骨头的人。全民大办钢铁，几千万人上山，这是小资产阶级的狂热性吗？我们说，发展小土群并把它逐步提高为小洋群，使土洋结合起来的英雄好汉们，才是真正具有无产阶级坚定性的人，具有无产阶级骨头的人。把无产阶级的坚定性说成是“小资产阶级狂热性”的人们，恰恰说明他们有资产阶级的坚定性，他们要用资产阶级的坚定性来攻击我们无产阶级的坚定性。而结果，则是他们迫使我们以无产阶级的坚定性来粉碎他们的资产阶级的坚定性。
    我们清楚地看到了，只有总路线、大跃进、人民公社这些伟大的新生事物的继续发展和继续胜利，才能彻底肃清资本主义制度的残余，彻底改变如同列宁所说的时时刻刻都在滋生着资本主义因素的个体经济。只有总路线、大跃进、人民公社的继续发展和胜利，才能彻底消灭阶级。它们的胜利就是资本主义彻底死亡的征兆。因此，这是一场严重的阶级斗争。恰恰是在这一点上，总路线、大跃进、人民公社才触动了那些犯有右倾机会主义错误的同志们的灵魂深处的资产阶级王国，触动了他们的资产阶级的坚定性。这样，他们就起来骂人了，叫喊了，泼冷水了。这种叫喊和泼冷水，实质上是党内的资产阶级的代理人在忠诚地执行着资产阶级进攻无产阶级的任务，是资产阶级反社会主义思潮在党内的反映。今天我们和右倾机会主义分子在政治上和理论上进行争论的本质及其严重意义，就在这里。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社，使资本主义失的太多，使社会主义得的太多；我们应当为这些伟大成就雀跃欢呼，而不应当对运动中的缺点大惊小怪
    右倾机会主义分子抓住我们在工作中已经或者正在纠正的某些缺点，东拼西凑，加以渲染和夸大，作为诬蔑和进攻的资本。这也实在太可怜了，但这却又是在政治上和理论上带有原则性的问题。革命能没有缺点吗？甚至于革命能没有错误吗？在1958年的巨大跃进中，在取得伟大成就的同时，工作中是存在着某些缺点的。如果说没有缺点，我们就无需起来纠正这些缺点了。可是，这些缺点和我们的成绩相比较又算得什么呢？在实际上不过是一个指头与九个指头的关系罢了。所谓九个指头，就是指在总路线的正确指引下所造成的大跃进的新形势和人民公社的诞生。这是伟大的新生事物，这是决定我国命运的新生事物，是伟大的中国人民把社会主义革命进行到底的根本标志。所谓一个指头，只不过是在这些新事物诞生的时候，由于我们和群众经验不足而产生的某些缺点，但因经验不足而发生一些缺点，是任何革命都不可避免的。谁要是怕缺点就不要做工作，谁要是怕错误就不要干革命。一个新事物在刚诞生的时候，总是原始的、朴素的、粗糙的，不是一下子就能达到完美的形态的。生一个小小的婴儿还要流点血、剪脐带。难道像伟大的人民公社这样巨大的新事物的诞生，全民大跃进这样伟大的形势的出现，就一点岔子都不出吗？就要求我们的工作一点漏洞都没有吗？这显然是不可能的。试问：有九个指头的成绩、一个指头的缺点，就不干革命了吗？有两个指头的缺点怎么办？有三个指头的缺点怎么办？无产阶级的革命家敢于这样说：成绩和缺点七比三要干，六比四也要干。因为这究竟是得大于失啊！革命不是绣花，革命不是在月白风清的夜晚谈情说爱，而是亿万人民怒涛骇浪式的英勇斗争。在革命的浪潮中，飞溅出一些浪花，打到人们的脸上，就大惊小怪地叫嚣起来，这种所谓革命者不是一种十足的伪君子又是什么呢？还是关于1871年巴黎公社的问题，马克思在批评库格曼对这一伟大的革命表示怀疑的时候写道：“如果斗争只是在有极顺利成功机会的条件下才着手举行，那末创造世界历史的事情当然就会是一件很方便的事情了。”而在巴黎公社失败之后，马克思又说道：“革命死了，革命万岁！马克思表现了多么伟大的无产阶级革命家的坚定性和气魄呵。”以此为训，我们的总路线和大跃进所取得的伟大成就，已经而且正在发挥出无穷的威力，我们的人民公社，正越来越强烈地显示出它的磅礴的生命力，一句话，我们的革命生了，我们又为什么不能雀跃欢呼革命万万岁呢？！在这样伟大的革命群众运动中所产生的点滴缺点，又何足以值得大惊小怪呢？！这就不难看出，右倾机会主义分子对我国的大跃进和人民公社，完全采取了俄国资本家老爷及其走狗们对共产主义义务劳动星期六所持的资产阶级老爷式的态度。在这里，请听听列宁的话吧：
    “如果从实质上来观察问题，难道历史上有一种新生产方式是不经过许许多多的失败和反复的错误而一下子就发展起来的吗？农奴制颠覆后过了半世纪，俄国农村仍有不少的农奴制残余。美国废除黑奴制度后过了半世纪，那里的黑人往往还处于半奴隶状态。资产阶级知识分子，连孟什维克和社会革命党人在内，始终保持替资本服务的本色，抓住虚伪透顶的论据；在无产阶级革命之前，他们责备我们是空想主义者，而在革命之后，他们却要求我们用荒唐的速度来铲除旧制度的遗迹！
    “但我们不是空想主义者，我们知道资产阶级‘论据’的真实价值，也知道旧东西的残余在革命后的一定时期内还必然胜过新的幼芽。当新事物刚刚诞生时，旧事物在相当时期内总是比新事物强些，这在自然界或社会生活中都是常见的现象，讥笑新的幼芽软弱，抱着轻浮的知识分子的怀疑态度等等，——这一切实际上是资产阶级反对无产阶级的阶级斗争手段，是保护资本主义而反对社会主义。我们应当缜密地研究新的幼芽，极仔细地对待它们，尽力帮助它们成长，并‘照护’这些柔弱的幼芽。”  而且，问题还在于，在党中央毛泽东同志的领导下，中国人民改正自己前进中的缺点是非常敏捷和迅速的。这就是说，我们的人民公社和大跃进中一系列的新生事物，已经不是什么柔弱的幼芽，而是迅速地成为经过风霜考验的峥嵘大树了。
    右倾机会主义分子向我们进攻的另一理由，就是所谓失大于得，得不偿失的论调。我们对此也必须进行严厉的驳斥。1958年的大跃进到底是得还是失？是得大于失、还是失大于得？是谁失得多、谁得得多？这确又是一个在政治上、在理论上带有原则性的问题。我们说，在1958年，中国人民不是什么得大于失的问题，而是得得太多，得到了从我们的祖先在这块土地上立业以来所未曾得到过的东西。试查查历史看，在那本历史书上中国人民年产过一千一百零八万吨钢？年产过五千亿斤粮食？我们的祖先在“礼运”上就幻想过大同世界，迄今已数千年，而只是在1958年才在我们的国土上出现了在将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好的组织形式——伟大的人民公社。这个得失的账到底怎么算？我说，应该是这样算法：资产阶级，资本主义制度是失的太多了，而无产阶级，社会主义制度是得的太多了。这也反映了“旧者不去，新者不来”的真理。他们失掉了他们不想失掉的东西，而我们却得到了我们应该得到的东西。这也就是无产阶级革命家，也就是马克思列宁主义的得失观。还有一笔账也可以算：我们有过一些缺点，犯过一些错误，浪费过一些粮食和人力，某些生产指标订的高了些。这算不算失？能不能说是失大于得？经过批评和自我批评之后，克服了缺点和错误，使我们的干部和群众不是又得到更多的东西吗？不是又得到一些更宝贵的更有价值的东西吗？还是马克思和恩格斯说得对，无产阶级革命丢掉的是锁链，而赢得的是全世界。这种马克思主义的得失观用之于观察无产阶级的革命是如此，用之于观察某一时期的具体事物也必须是如此。我们必须坚持这种得失观，才能更有勇气乘风破浪般地前进！右倾机会主义分子，抓住现象，丢掉本质；抓住芝麻，丢掉西瓜；抓住一个指头，就要砍掉九个指头。我们必须向他们大喊一声：同志！请你住手。这是砍不得的！这样作是我们的敌人所欢迎的，是人民所反对的。
    右倾机会主义分子已经陷入资产阶级经验主义和唯我主义的泥坑；我们必须为捍卫马克思列宁主义的世界观而斗争
    当我们严格地划分了无产阶级政治家和资产阶级政治家对于群众的革命运动截然相反的两种立场两种态度之后，还必须进一步地揭露右倾机会主义分子和无产阶级世界观相对抗的资产阶级世界观。列宁曾指出：“马克思学说之所以万能，就是因为它正确。它十分完备而严整，给了人们一个决不同任何迷信、任何反动、任何辩护资产阶级压迫的思想相调和的完整世界观。”这是十分对的。我们伟大的马克思主义的导师们之所以成为卓越的无产阶级革命家，就是由于他们在任何历史时期，任何的历史事件中，总是把这个万能的世界观贯彻到底的。他们尊重唯物论，尊重辩证法，尊重历史唯物主义，所以他们能够把革命看成是人民群众的盛大的节日。他们始终在革命的惊涛骇浪中积极地发动群众，组织群众，支持群众，并且在群众运动中不断地总结经验教训，勇敢地、正确地引导群众继续前进。他们始终不愧为革命的惊涛骇浪中的伟大的舵手。与此相反，一切机会主义者、一切党内的资产阶级革命家，他们的最大的失足之处是离开了这个万能的世界观。他们只尊重唯心论，尊重形而上学，尊重历史唯心主义。这种世界观的对抗，反映阶级的对抗，而阶级的对抗又加强了世界观的对抗，这是必然的逻辑。值得我们加以特别注意的是，现在党内右倾机会主义分子的世界观，已经深深地陷入资产阶级的经验主义的泥坑中去了。右倾机会主义分子的经验主义，由于他们的唯我主义的特征，已经和主观唯心主义结下不解之缘了。所谓一切由我的经验而来，也就是一切由我的感觉而来，客观世界、客观存在的一切就是我的感觉的复合。因之他们不承认客观真理，不承认实践是检验真理的标准。总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是我们国家最伟大的客观存在，而在他们的主观唯心论的支配下，有变成无，得变成失，正确变成错误，光明变成黑暗，从而也就把他们自己引向极其渺小、极其卑鄙的唯我主义的泥坑中去了。唯我主义听其发展下去，就必然引向资产阶级的功利主义，引向实用主义。有资产阶级的功利主义，就没有无产阶级的功利主义。有唯我主义的功利主义，就没有人民群众的功利主义。这是世界观上的你死我活的斗争。在这里不管右倾机会主义分子是否系统地学过主观唯心主义的哲学，问题是在于他们的思想实质如此。
    正是在这里，也就说明保卫党的总路线，保卫中国人民革命的伟大胜利，就不能不同时为捍卫党的万能的世界观——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义而斗争！
    我们的成绩是异常伟大的，我们的前途是异常光明的，让我们更高地举起毛泽东的红旗奋勇前进吧！
    ①鲍威尔兄弟是十九世纪三十年代至四十年代德国自由主义的思想家，黑格尔学派中右翼资产阶级激进派的代表。他们否定社会的客观规律性和人民群众活动的头等意义，认为自我意识是强大的历史创造力。他们宣扬个人崇拜，把个人看得高于人民，认为无产阶级和劳动人民是不能进行独立的历史活动的“平庸的群众”。因此，他们非难十八世纪的资产阶级革命，并以“理性的”（即剥削者的）国家所倡议实行的资产阶级改革来和革命相对抗。
    ②在巴黎公社的委员中，分为多数派和少数派，多数派是由布朗基主义者构成，少数派多半是蒲鲁东派。蒲鲁东是无政府主义的创始人之一，他幻想使小私有制永世长存，并从小资产阶级的立场批判大资本主义所有制。他反对阶级斗争，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。布朗基主义是法国社会主义运动中以路易·奥古斯特、布朗基（1805—1881）为首的一个流派。马克思列宁主义的经典作家认为布朗基是杰出的革命家和社会主义的拥护者，但同时也批判他的宗派主义和密谋活动的方式。布朗基派否定阶级斗争，他们指望“不通过无产阶级的阶级斗争，而通过少数知识分子的密谋活动来把人类从雇佣奴隶制下解放出来（列宁语）。
    ③罗伯斯庇尔（1758—1794）是十八世纪末法国资产阶级革命的杰出活动家，1793—1794年雅各宾专政的革命政府的首脑。因他在贯彻革命的改造方面勇敢、坚决，遂使资产阶级革命战胜了外部和内部的敌人。但是罗伯斯庇尔和他所领导的雅各宾派却反对“疯人派”和爱贝尔派（左翼雅各宾派）的革命要求，他们的这种资产阶级的局限性就使人民群众离开了雅各宾派。反革命的资产阶级分子遂利用雅各宾专政的削弱，举行了政变。1794年7月27日罗伯斯庇尔被捕，次日遇害。
