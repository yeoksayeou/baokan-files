Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. The Hubei Tractor Factory comprehensively completed the state plan for the third quarter twenty-two days ahead of schedule. Now, all factory workers are striving to complete the annual diesel engine production task before National Day, dedicating even more brilliant achievements to the 10th anniversary of National Day. At the same time, they are actively preparing for a major battle in the fourth quarter, proposing to comprehensively overfulfill the annual plan one month ahead of schedule, increase the production of one thousand diesel engines to support farmers, and propose to launch a friendly competition with fraternal factories in the province's machinery industry. After comprehensively overfulfilling the planned targets for July, the factory's Party committee organized workers to study the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-leaning Sentiments and Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy," criticized the right-leaning and slackening thoughts existing among some cadres, and put forward the battle slogan of "Oppose Rightism, Boost Enthusiasm, Fight a Big Battle in August and September, and complete the third quarter plan ahead of schedule to support a bumper agricultural harvest and welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day." They continued to carry out technological innovation and strengthen enterprise management, and a newer and greater leap forward situation emerged in the factory. More than 70% of the workers exceeded labor quotas every day, creating new records, and achieving 111 major technological innovations in a short period.
