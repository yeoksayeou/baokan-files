Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd. While vigorously grasping this year's production, the Huainan Coal Mine is accelerating the expansion of eight old mines and the construction of the Kongji and Liziz mining pairs, preparing in advance for a continued leap forward in production next year. After these expanded and newly built mines are put into production, the designed output of the Huainan Coal Mine will increase by 38% compared to the existing mines' designed output. The eight expanded mines will continue to extend 100 to 220 meters deeper into the strata, increasing production capacity by 24%.

The scale of these expansion and new construction projects is quite large, with over 90 kilometers of tunneling. Currently, key mine sites have established infrastructure construction headquarters to uniformly arrange the construction procedures, dates, and methods, and to formulate various measures for safe and rapid construction. Regarding the equipment and materials required for the project, in addition to some major equipment being allocated by the state and relying on external cooperation to resolve, a set of proactive measures to tap potential from within the enterprise has also been adopted. To date, various mine sites have successively adjusted more than 500 pieces of lifting, tunneling, and transportation equipment, as well as a large amount of steel and timber. Workers have also launched a safe and rapid construction competition, and boldly reformed mining development technology. For example, the Li Yingzi No. 2 Mine changed the past procedure of building the shaft first and then the yard, simultaneously developing the shaft, transportation tunnels, and yard, preparing the coal mining face in advance, which can bring the mine into production half a year earlier. In addition, workers have actively promoted the Zhengui multi-cycle rapid tunneling experience of the Xuzhou Quantai Coal Mine, greatly improving work efficiency. The average monthly footage of each tunneling head in the Datong Mine has increased from 100 meters to 200 meters. The Xin Zhuangzi Red Flag Youth Tunneling Team and the Xie No. 1 Mine Tunneling Team No. 5 completed the entire year's tunneling task in six or seven months. The entire mine exceeded the state plan by 4.1% for the excavation and development of roadways in August and exceeded the state plan by 2.8% again from September 1st to 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th. The second phase expansion project of the Fuxin Power Plant is being stepped up day and night. The construction project of the generator set system has been fully launched.

On the civil engineering construction site, the tenth cooling tower has already stood tall. The planned construction period for this huge building was twenty-six days, but the workers actually built it in only twenty-two days. The large factory building, as tall as ten floors, is constantly extending eastward. A large transformer is about to be installed. Of the two 220-ton boilers, one has already completed off-site assembly and is waiting to be hoisted and installed; the assembly work for the other has also begun. The formal installation of the main body of the generator set—the turbine and the generator—is actively being prepared.

The builders of the Fuxin Power Plant completed the installation of two generator sets at an amazing speed in the first half of this year. The first one took only fifty-six days, and the second one's construction period was further shortened to forty-two days. Starting in July, they actively prepared for the construction and installation of this new generator set. Workers at each construction site, aiming to improve construction efficiency and shorten the construction period, worked hard and cleverly, launching a vigorous competition. In addition to creating the shortest construction period when building the cooling tower, the off-site assembly project of the boiler was also shortened from forty-five days in the past to thirty days. In the past, steel bars were bent after being heated with fire, which took five minutes to bend one. This time, the installation workers created a tool tire that can bend three steel bars in one minute.

    为明年生产跃进做好准备
    淮南煤矿加快步伐扩建新建十对矿井
    阜新发电厂第二期扩建工程日夜施工
    新华社合肥23日电　淮南煤矿在大抓今年生产的同时，正大力加快八对老矿井的扩建工程和孔集、李嘴孜两对新井的建设，为明年生产继续跃进提前作好准备。这批扩建和新建矿井移交生产后，淮南煤矿的设计产量将比现有矿井设计产量增加38％。八对扩建矿井将继续向地层深部延伸一百米到二百二十米，生产能力将提高24％。
    这些扩建和新建工程规模很大，井巷工程就有九十多公里长。目前重点矿场都成立了基建指挥部，统一安排了施工程序、日期、方法，制定了安全快速施工的各种措施。在工程需用的设备和材料方面，除一些主要设备由国家调拨和靠外地协作解决外，还采取了一套从企业内部挖掘潜力的积极措施。到目前为止，各矿场已先后调整出五百多台（件）提升、掘进、运输等方面的设备，以及大批的钢材和木材。职工们也开展了安全快速施工竞赛运动，并且大胆改革矿井开拓技术。如李郢孜二矿改变过去先建井筒后建车场的程序，把井筒、运道、车场同时开拓，提前准备采煤工作面，可使这个扩建矿井提前半年出煤。另外，工人们还积极推广了徐州权台煤矿正规多循环快速掘进经验，大大提高了工作效率，大通矿井平均每个掘进头月进尺由一百米提高到二百米。新庄孜红旗青年掘进队和谢一矿掘进五队，用六七个月的时间，就完成了全年掘进任务。全矿8月份掘进开拓巷道超额4.1％完成了国家计划，9月1至20日又超额2.8％完成了国家计划。
    新华社沈阳24日电　阜新发电厂第二期扩建工程正在日夜加紧施工。发电机组系统的建设工程已经全面展开。
    在土木建筑工地，第十号冷却水塔，已经巍然矗立。这座庞大的建筑物，计划工期为二十六天，但是职工们实际只用了二十二天就把它建成。有十层楼那么高的大厂房，正在不断地向东伸展。一台大型变压器即将安装完毕。两台二百二十吨的锅炉，一台已经完成厂外组合，只待起吊安装；另一台的组合工作也已开始。发电机组的本体——汽轮机和发电机的正式安装，正在积极准备。
    阜新发电厂的建设者，在今年上半年以惊人的速度完成两台发电机组的安装任务，头一台只用五十六天，第二台工期更缩短到四十二天。从7月份开始，他们就积极准备这套新的发电机组的建设和安装工作。各工地工人都以提高施工效率缩短工期为目标，苦干加巧干，展开热火朝天的竞赛。除了在修建冷却水塔时创造了最短的工期以外，锅炉的厂外组合工程也由过去的四十五天缩短到三十天。过去弯钢筋先用火烧，要五分钟才能弯好一根，这次安装工人创造一种工具胎，一分钟就能弯好三根。
