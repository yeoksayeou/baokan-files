    Linxia Prefecture Party Committee Issues Combat Call to Greet the Tenth Anniversary of National Day
    Strive for All-Round Redness in Every Field
    (Reported by this newspaper) A mass movement to eliminate weak links and ensure all-round redness in all industries, regions, and units to celebrate the tenth anniversary of National Day is unfolding vigorously in the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province.

    Because the people's communes have opened up a path to comprehensive prosperity for the countryside, an unprecedentedly excellent situation has emerged in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture. In agricultural production, the per-mu yield of spring wheat crossed the Yellow River eight years ahead of schedule, and the total output increased by 47% compared with the bumper year of 1958. Autumn crops are generally growing well, with a potential increase of 10% to 20%. In terms of industry, pig iron production has completed the annual plan ahead of schedule. The completion of agricultural product procurement, commodity sales, enterprise profits, and urban and rural savings is generally 50% to 98% higher than in the same period last year. In order to implement the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Linxia Prefecture Party Committee put forward a combat call to the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture to achieve all-round redness in every field to celebrate the tenth anniversary of National Day. The Prefecture Party Committee required that autumn fields be weeded again, fertilized one more time, and each mu should produce 50 jin more grain than originally planned; industrial indicators should increase by 20%; commerce should complete 85% to 100% of various indicators before National Day, and continue to comprehensively over fulfill tasks in the fourth quarter.

    In order to ensure the realization of various leap forward indicators, a mass inspection and comparison movement has been launched first. The Provincial Party Committee's agricultural inspection team inspected 43 communes (out of 45 communes in the prefecture), 242 production teams, and 580 work teams throughout the prefecture. During the inspection, experiences were discovered, summarized on the spot, and problems were discovered and solved on the spot. Combining seeing, listening, and doing, combining the establishment of pacesetters, driving the general, and transforming the backward to promote the general. During the inspection, 12 telephone conferences and 48 on-site meetings were held, summarizing 363 experiences, and widely introducing 28 important advanced experiences throughout the prefecture. 147 problems were solved, and 9 backward communes and 116 production teams were helped to change their appearance. This large-scale inspection work is developing extensively and deeply. Three counties (cities) and 45 people's communes in the prefecture have organized 102 various inspection teams (groups) to inspect all walks of life, all communes, teams, and people, and every piece of farmland and product. In addition, the Linxia Prefecture Party Committee also paid special attention to grasping the key points to help weak links, overcome shortcomings, and catch up with the advanced. Shen Xiaxi, secretary of the Prefecture Party Committee, helped Hezheng Iron and Steel Plant break through technical barriers and complete the annual plan in seven months. Liu Haiquan, Minister of Industry and Transportation of the Prefecture Party Committee, worked in the foundry workshop of the Prefecture Agricultural Machinery Plant for a month, helping workers increase their daily output by 83%, turning weak links into advanced ones.

    Recently, a leap forward situation has emerged in the prefecture, with agriculture leading the way, with a single horse taking the lead and ten thousand horses galloping forward. Originally, only 400,000 mu of the 680,000 mu of autumn fields had been weeded once, but now all of them have been weeded once, 450,000 mu have been weeded twice, and 150,000 mu have been weeded three times. The area of topdressing has also increased by two times. The late-stage processing of autumn fields, with the content of "labor exceeding quotas, actual production exceeding contracts, and backward exceeding the advanced," is underway. Increasing production by 50 jin per mu has become a relatively stable indicator, and now each commune has put forward the slogan of further processing to increase production. At the same time, 13.2 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated for next year, and 960,000 mu of land has been cultivated in the fall, an increase of eight times compared with the same period last year. The work of purchasing grain and putting it into storage has started 50 days earlier than in previous years. Since the end of August, industrial production has seen each factory exceeding its daily production plan every day. In the power industry and metal processing industry, the average daily output value in late August increased by 23% to 29% compared with mid-August, and the daily output value of the chemical industry, light industry, and building materials industry increased by one to three times during the same period. As of September 5, in terms of commerce, the purchase of sheepskin, cowhide, and goatskin has exceeded the annual plan, and other purchase and sales indicators will be comprehensively over fulfilled ahead of schedule, at the latest within October. Fiscal revenue will be completed this month.

    临夏州委发出迎接国庆十周年战斗号召
    力争行行处处满堂红
    本报讯　一个消除薄弱环节，保证各行业、各地区、各单位满堂红，庆祝国庆十周年的群众运动，正在甘肃省临夏回族自治州猛烈展开。
    由于人民公社为农村开拓了全面繁荣的道路，临夏回族自治州出现了空前的大好形势。农业生产，春小麦亩产量提前八年跨过了黄河，总产量比特大丰收的1958年还增加了47％。秋田普遍生长良好，可增产一至二成。工业方面生铁产量，已提前完成了全年计划。农产品采购、商品销售、企业利润、城乡储蓄等完成情况，普遍比去年同期增长50％至98％。中共临夏州委为了贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，向全州各族人民提出了行行处处满堂红，庆祝国庆十周年的战斗号召。州委要求秋田再锄一遍草，多追一次肥，每亩比原计划多增产五十斤粮食；工业指标增长20％；商业在国庆节前完成各项指标的85％至100％，第四季度继续全面超额完成任务。
    为了保证实现各项跃进指标，首先掀起了全民性的大检查、大评比运动。省委农业检查团检查了全州的四十三个公社（全州共四十五个公社）、二百四十二个生产队、五百八十个作业队。检查中，发现经验，就地总结，发现问题，就地解决。把看、听、做结合起来，把树立标兵、带动一般和改造落后、促进一般结合起来。检查中曾经召开了十二次电话会议、四十八次现场会议，总结经验三百六十三条，将其中二十八项重要先进经验，在全州广泛介绍。解决了一百四十七个问题，帮助九个后进公社、一百一十六个生产队改变了面貌。这种大检查工作正在向广泛深入发展，全州三县（市）和四十五个人民公社，已组织起一百零二个各种检查团（组），检查着各行各业、各社、队、人和每一块庄稼、产品。此外，临夏州委还特别注意抓紧重点帮助薄弱环节，克服缺点，赶上先进。州委书记沈遐熙，帮助和政炼铁厂突破了技术关，七个月完成全年计划。州委工交部长刘海泉在州农械厂铸工车间劳动一月，帮助工人提高日产量83％，使薄弱环节变为先进。
    近来，全州出现了以农业带头的一马当先、万马奔腾的跃进局面。六十八万多亩秋田，原来只有四十万亩锄过一遍草，现在全部都锄过了头遍草，四十五亩锄过二遍，十五万亩锄了三遍。追肥面积也增加了两倍。以“劳动超定额，实产超包产，落后超先进”为内容的秋田后期加工正在紧张进行。每亩超产五十斤，已成为比较稳妥的指标，现在各公社又提出了再加工多超产的口号。同时，已为明年积肥一百三十二亿斤，伏耕地九十六万亩，比去年同期增加了八倍。征购粮入仓工作，比往年提前五十天开始了。工业生产自8月下旬开始，各厂每天都超额完成日产计划。电力工业、金属加工工业，8月下旬的日产值平均比中旬增加了23％至29％，化学工业、轻工业、建筑材料工业的同期的日产值更增加了一至三倍。截至9月5日，商业方面，羊皮、牛皮、山羊皮收购已超额完成全年计划，其他各项收购销售指标，最迟在10月份内就能提前全面超额完成。财政收入更将在本月内完成任务。
