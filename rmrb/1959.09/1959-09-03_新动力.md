	New Momentum
		By our correspondent, Gu Ping

	On the evening of August 27th, the square of Guangfu Commune on the eastern shore of Taihu Lake was brightly lit, and red flags fluttered in the evening breeze. More than two thousand commune member representatives, from the waterwheels in the mountain valleys, from the silkworm rearing rooms, and from their respective labor posts, gathered here to the sound of gongs and drums, excitedly discussing the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

	That morning, people learned the content of the communique and resolutions from the radio. Everyone spread the word, conveying this call to battle.

	Weng Zongmin, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, formally conveyed the contents of the communique and resolutions at the meeting. Warm applause rolled through the venue. He summarized the achievements of the Guangfu Commune's Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in the first half of this year. This year, the commune's 14,000 mu of wheat yielded 50% more per mu than in 1958; spring cocoons increased by 30%; and the total output of flowers and fruits increased by 17%. Weng Zongmin then said that to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, we must continue to leap forward. He analyzed the objective conditions and the enthusiasm of the masses, and put forward a detailed plan for increasing production and practicing economy that could be achieved through effort. The overall goal of this plan is to increase the yield of rice by 50 jin per mu, increase the yield of autumn cocoons by 10 jin per sheet, and increase the income of each household by another 5 yuan and 9 jiao. In terms of economy, the commune plans to repair 295 waterwheels and put them into drought resistance, which can replace the work of 30 water pumps. This will not only save more than 24,000 yuan in fuel costs, but also solve the current difficulty of insufficient machine supply. This plan for increasing production and practicing economy was warmly welcomed by the commune members. The venue was boiling, everyone cheered, and everyone offered suggestions.

	Xu Rungeng, the secretary of the Xiangxue Brigade, the model brigade of the entire commune and also of Wu County, took the stage to speak first, carrying the wishes of more than 1,000 brigade members. After receiving the newspaper at noon, the Xiangxue Brigade had already used its rest time to convene a meeting of brigade members to discuss in detail the brigade's plan for increasing production and practicing economy. The original production target of this brigade was 890 jin of rice per mu, and the brigade members' meeting decided to revise it to 1,050 jin. Xu Rungeng said loudly at the meeting: "Responding to the call of the Party, we must be at the forefront."

	Next, representatives from the pumping station, the agricultural machinery factory, and the supply and marketing cooperative also put forward their units' plans for increasing production and practicing economy, focusing on the current struggle against drought to ensure a bumper harvest. Many brigades and production teams that did not have time to speak wrote letters of determination and sent them to the stage.

	It was late at night, and the commune member representatives, holding red flags and full of passion for a major undertaking, returned to their respective labor posts and worked day and night. On the 28th, the number of the drought resistance army doubled compared to the previous few days. Nearly two thousand people were distributed on the waterwheel groups rising around the mountains, chanting high-pitched water-drawing work songs and beating cheerful gongs and drums to bring the water of Taihu Lake to the upland fields. Another two thousand people were busy fighting drought for the autumn seedlings. Some poured cold water on the roofs and surrounding walls of the silkworm rearing rooms to lower the temperature. The soaring enthusiasm of the people has now been given new momentum.

    8月27日晚上，太湖东岸光福公社的广场上，灯光通明，红旗在晚风中习习飘动。二千多个社员代表，从山坞里的水车上，从蚕室里，从他们各自的劳动岗位上，敲锣打鼓集中到这里，兴高采烈地讨论党的八届八中全会的公报和决议。
    这天早晨，人们从广播里知道了公报和决议的内容。大家奔走相告，传送着这个战斗的号召。
    公社党委书记翁宗民在大会上正式传达公报和决议的内容，热烈的掌声在全场滚动。他总结了光福公社1958年的大跃进和今年上半年继续跃进的成绩。今年全社一万四千亩麦子单产比1958年增长50％；春茧增长30％；花果总产量增长17％。翁宗民接着说，第二个五年计划要提前完成，我们就要继续跃进。他分析了客观条件和群众的干劲，提出了一个经过努力可以完成的增产节约的详细计划。这个计划总的目标是每亩水稻超产五十斤粮，每张秋蚕超产十斤茧，每户再增加收入五元九角。节约方面，公社计划把二百九十五部水车整修好投入抗旱，可以代替三十部抽水机的工作。这不但能节约燃料费二万四千多元，还能解决当前机器供不应求的困难。这个增产节约计划得到了社员们的热烈响应。会场上沸腾起来了，人人欢呼，个个献计。
    全公社、也是全吴县的标兵大队——香雪大队的支部书记许润庚，带着全队一千多社员的心意第一个登台发言。香雪大队在中午接到报纸后，已经利用休息时间召开了社员大会，详细讨论了大队的增产节约计划。这个大队原来的包产指标水稻单产是八百九十斤，社员大会决定修订为一千零五十斤。许润庚在大会上响亮地说：“响应党的号召，我们要走在最前面。”
    接着抽水机站、农业机械厂及供销社等单位的代表也都围绕当前抗旱保丰收的斗争，提出了本单位的增产节约计划。来不及发言的许多大队和生产队写了决心书送到台上。
    夜深了，社员代表们举着红旗，满怀大干一场的激情，回到各自的劳动岗位上，夜以继日地干起来了。28日，抗旱大军的人数比前几天增加了一倍。近两千人分布在环山而上的水车群上，他们打着高亢的车水号子，敲起欢快的锣鼓，把太湖之水引上山田。另外两千人在忙着给秋苗抗旱。有的用凉水泼浇蚕室的屋顶和四围墙壁，降低蚕室温度。人们的冲天干劲如今又增加了新的动力。
