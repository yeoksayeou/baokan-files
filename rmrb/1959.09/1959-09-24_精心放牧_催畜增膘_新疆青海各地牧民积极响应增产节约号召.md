Xinhua News Agency report:

    In the vast pastoral areas of Xinjiang, herdsmen of all ethnic groups are putting forward measures to increase production, using practical actions to increase livestock production and respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. They are both stepping up the autumn breeding work of livestock and seizing the golden season when pastures are abundant and the climate is cool, storing winter grass, carefully grazing, and promoting rapid fattening of livestock.
    In the Tacheng area, which combines agriculture and animal husbandry, after cadres and members of the communes studied and discussed the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, a vigorous upsurge of increasing production and practicing thrift has been launched for more than half a month. The progress of autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and grass cutting in the entire area has been greatly accelerated, and the breeding task of large livestock has been completed very well. By September 8, more than 89% of the mares and cows that should have been bred in the entire area had been bred. The Nilka County communes in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture are focusing on grass cutting and autumn livestock breeding. By September 10, the county had cut 96 million catties of grass, equivalent to the total amount for the entire year last year. The autumn breeding work for two births in three years of sheep in various communes was originally planned to account for only 40% of the breeding-age ewes. After the members studied the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, their enthusiasm for increasing production was very high, and they revised the target to 60%. Now, the communes have separately grouped the ewes that can carry out two births in three years for breeding. The communes also organized thirty-five cadres to go deep into the pastures to inspect the breeding work of large livestock and carry out supplementary breeding to ensure that the conception rate of large livestock reaches 90%.
    All pastoral areas are seizing the opportunity of abundant pastures to focus on autumn fattening. The Party Committee of the Halamaya Commune in Fuhai County, Altay Prefecture, recently mobilized more than 1,100 pastoral members of the commune to check the fattening of more than 60,000 livestock in the commune. It was decided to strengthen the grazing of some weak riding horses and replace some strong horses for riding; stop milking weak dairy cows; concentrate the weak ewes and drive them in front of the flock to eat good grass; extend the grazing time for weak livestock, add saltpeter, and implement a special person responsible for fattening. After taking these measures, the condition of some weak livestock in the commune has improved significantly.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 23rd: Herdsmen in various communes on the Qinghai grassland are doing everything possible to eliminate the three types of livestock fatness, not allowing breeding-age female livestock to go through the autumn without conception, and striving to develop animal husbandry production at high speed, dedicating gifts to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.
    At the end of August, the proportion of first and second-class fatness of various livestock on the grassland accounted for 90%; since September, it has risen to more than 90% for first-class fatness alone. More than 90% of the breeding-age ewes have been bred. More and more silage haystacks are piled up at various settlements of the people's communes. Up to now, more than 26,000 sheds and pens have been built, and more than 300 million catties of grass have been cut. The survival rate of young livestock in various places this year is also very high.
    Currently, the autumn is high and the grass is fertile on the grassland. The production teams of various people's communes have implemented a super-production reward system of determining livestock groups, pastures, livestock fatness, and work points, continuing to focus on autumn fattening, and further eliminating the three types of fatness. Many herders graze with the flock during the day and sleep next to the livestock at night; cattle, horses, and other large livestock are grazed at night to ensure they are full and have enough to drink. In addition to strengthening feeding and management, all localities are also focusing on the prevention and control of livestock diseases.
    After breeding various breeding-age female livestock, all localities have also tried their best to prevent female livestock from not conceiving through inspections to ensure increased production of offspring. The Zhenqin Commune in Chengduo County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, transferred experienced old herdsmen to specially feed and manage breeding livestock, ensuring the health of breeding livestock and increasing the conception rate of female livestock.
    At the same time, all localities have also extracted part of the labor force to invest in the activity of cutting and storing green grass. The Zhihe Brigade of Guomaying Commune in Guinan County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, extracted seventy-five young and middle-aged members, carrying tents and pack animals, to go to the pastures dozens of miles away where livestock cannot graze to cut grass. Due to the competition between teams, more than 660,000 catties of grass were cut in ten days. After the six production teams of Jianzhatan Commune in Jianzha County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, launched a friendship competition, they proposed to add another one million catties on the basis of the original plan to cut three million catties of grass, and guaranteed to complete this plan to dedicate gifts to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

    精心放牧　催畜增膘
    新疆青海各地牧民积极响应增产节约号召
    据新华社讯　在新疆辽阔的牧区，各族牧民纷纷提出增产措施，以增产牲畜的实际行动，响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召。他们正在一面加紧牲畜秋季配种工作，一面抓紧牧草丰茂、气候凉爽的黄金季节，打储冬草，精心放牧，催牲畜迅速增膘。
    农牧业结合的塔城专区，各公社干部和社员学习和讨论了八中全会决议以后，半个多月来已掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约高潮，全专区秋收、秋种和打草进度大大加快，大牲畜配种任务已完成得很好。到9月8日，全专区应配种的母马、母牛，已有89％以上配好。伊犁哈萨克族自治州尼勒克县公社大抓打草和牲畜秋配工作。到9月10日，全县已打草九千六百万斤，等于去年全年的总和。各公社绵羊两年三产秋季配种工作，原来计划只占适龄母羊的40％，社员们学习了八中全会决议以后，增产热情很高，把指标修改为60％。现在各公社已把能够进行两年三产的母羊单独编群，进行配种。各公社还组织了三十五名干部深入牧场检查大牲畜配种工作，进行补配，使大畜受胎率达到90％。
    各牧区都在牧草丰茂之际，大抓秋膘。阿勒泰专区福海县哈拉玛崖公社党委，最近发动全社一千一百多个牧业社员检查了全社六万多头牲畜长膘情况，决定对一部分瘦弱乘马加强牧放，换一部分壮马乘骑；瘦弱的奶牛停止挤奶；把瘦弱母羊集中起来，赶到羊群前面吃好草；对瘦弱牲畜延长放牧时间，加喂盐硝，实行专人负责的催膘责任制。采取这些措施以后，这个公社一部分瘦弱牲畜的膘体已显著有好转。
    据新华社西宁23日电　青海草原上各公社的牧民们正在千方百计地消灭牲畜三类膘，不让适龄母畜空怀过秋，用力争畜牧业生产高速度发展的行动，向建国十周年献礼。
    草原上各类牲畜的膘情，8月底的时候是一、二类膘合占90％；从9月份以来，已上升到仅一类膘就占90％以上。已经配种的适龄母羊也达到了90％以上。在人民公社的各个定居点上，堆起了越来越多的青贮草垛。截至目前，各地已修棚搭圈二万六千多个，打草三亿多斤。今年各地幼畜成活率也很高。
    当前，草原上秋高草肥。各人民公社生产队实行了定畜群、定草场、定畜膘、定工分的超产奖励制度，继续狠抓秋膘，进一步彻底消灭三类膘。许多放牧员白天跟群放牧，夜晚睡在畜群旁；牛马等大牲畜实行夜牧，保证吃饱喝足。除了加强饲放管理，各地还大抓畜病防治工作。
    各类适龄母畜配种以后，各地又通过检查，竭力防止母畜空怀，保证仔畜增产。玉树藏族自治州称多县珍秦公社抽调有经验的老牧民，专门饲养管理种畜，保证了种畜健壮，提高了母畜的受胎率。
    各地同时都抽出部分劳力投入打储青草的活动。海南藏族自治州贵南县过马营公社直核大队抽出七十五名青壮年社员携带帐房和驮畜，到几十里外牲畜放牧不到的牧场上去割草。由于队与队开展了竞赛，十天就打草六十六万多斤。黄南藏族自治州尖扎县尖扎滩公社六个生产队开展友谊竞赛以后，在原计划打草三百万斤的基础上，提出再增加一百万斤，并保证完成这个计划，向建国十周年献礼。（附图片）
