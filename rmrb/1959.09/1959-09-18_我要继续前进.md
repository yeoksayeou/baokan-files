    I Want to Keep Moving Forward
　　Mu Xiangxiong
    After breaking the world record for the second time on August 30th, I have strong confidence in achieving even better results at the National Games.
    I deeply understand that the convocation of the First National Games is of great significance. Therefore, I have been actively and earnestly preparing since September of last year.
    I was a bit nervous during the preliminary round on the first day, and the first fifty meters were slower, which affected the overall result. After the preliminary round, I analyzed the reasons for the poor performance. The leaders, coaches, and comrades encouraged me, and I regained my confidence.
    In the final, I corrected the shortcomings of the preliminary round. I paid attention to a quick reaction at the start, a shorter distance out of the water than before (coming out of the water at just over 11 meters), speeding up the movements, and exerting all my strength to touch the edge with my fingertips when reaching the finish line, etc.
    I was able to make a small contribution at the National Games and did not disappoint the expectations of the broad masses of the people. It should be said that this is the result of the Party's cultivation and education. I am determined to guard against arrogance and rashness, and continue to work hard to make greater contributions to the socialist sports cause of the motherland.

    我要继续前进
　　穆祥雄
    从8月30日第二次破世界纪录后，我对在全运会上创造更好的成绩的信心是很强的。
    我深深懂得第一届全运会的召开，意义十分重大。因此，从去年9月份开始我就一直积极认真地准备着。
    第一天预赛时我有些紧张，前五十米较慢，影响了整个成绩。预赛后，分析了成绩不太好的原因，领导、教练和同志们又鼓励，我自己又树立了信心。
    决赛中我便改正了预赛时的缺点，在起码时注意了反应要快，出水距离较前短（在11米多处出水），加快动作速度，到达终点时使出狠劲用指尖去碰边等。
    我能够在全运会上作出一点贡献，没有辜负广大人民对我的期望，应该说这是党的培养和教育的结果，我决定戒骄戒躁，继续努力为祖国的社会主义体育事业作出更大的贡献。
