Xinhua News Agency, September 4th – The People's Fine Arts Publishing House in Beijing has recently published a batch of classical and folk art albums. These albums are exquisitely printed, beautifully designed, and concentrate many excellent works from China's national fine arts heritage.

　　"Ming Dynasty Murals of Fahai Temple in Beijing" is a finely printed large album. Fahai Temple, located at the foot of Cuiwei Mountain in Moshikou, Beijing, was built in the 15th century during the reign of Emperor Yingzong of the Ming Dynasty. The style of the temple's murals is characterized by its bold and unrestrained yet meticulously rigorous qualities. The figures on the murals are up to one hundred and sixty centimeters tall, and the lines of the clothing, which are two to three meters long, are often completed in one stroke without interruption. Some areas depict incredibly detailed scenes in a space less than a square inch. The album also shows that the murals' coloring techniques are very advanced. The painters used "gold tracing" and "raised gold application" methods to create a magnificent atmosphere, which is rare in existing ancient mural relics. Experts believe that the murals of Fahai Temple are comparable to the murals of Mogao Grottoes and Yongle Palace and are one of the treasures of ancient Chinese mural art.

　　Folk woodblock New Year pictures are a type of art most closely related to the lives of the broad masses of people. Yangliuqing in the former Tianjin area of Hebei Province is one of the earliest and most representative origins of woodblock New Year pictures in China. The "Collection of Yangliuqing New Year Picture Materials" published this time collects more than ninety representative New Year pictures from the Ming Dynasty to the present, reflecting the local people's living conditions and the fighting spirit of punishing evil and promoting good. These New Year pictures cover a wide range of subjects, making them endlessly fascinating.

　　The Dunhuang art heritage is the artistic crystallization of the Chinese working people from the 4th to the 14th centuries. The fifty-four patterns collected in the "Selected Tang Dynasty Patterns of Dunhuang" originally decorated the columns and beams of the cave eaves, the ornaments of the statues, as well as the clothing, weapons, and furniture of the figures in the murals. These patterns are consistent with the patterns of Tang Dynasty brocades, ceramics, and bronzes. They reflect the creativity of Chinese traditional art in terms of national color and structural form. This is an important reference value for the study of our decorative arts.

　　The People's Fine Arts Publishing House in Beijing also sent specialists to the foot of Wengshan Mountain southwest of Taiyuan to photograph the Song Dynasty sculptures of Jinci Temple, and published the "Selected Song Sculptures of Jinci Temple" using collotype printing. Among them, the images of the concubines are the most vivid and beautiful, graceful and charming, and are masterpieces of Song Dynasty sculpture art. The "Pottery Figurines of the Six Dynasties in Nanjing" album is based on the photographic reproductions of relics from tombs of the Six Dynasties excavated in the Nanjing area. For a long time, few figurines from the Southern Dynasties have been found, leaving a blank in archaeology. This provides reliable physical evidence for the study of the funeral system and the issue of government and private slaves during the Six Dynasties.

    集中了民族美术遗产的许多优秀作品
    一批古典和民间画册出版
    新华社4日讯　北京人民美术出版社新近出版了一批古典、民间美术画册。这些画册印刷精致、装帧设计美观，集中了我国民族美术遗产中许多优秀的作品。
      “北京法海寺明代壁画”是一本精印的大型画册。座落在北京模式口翠微山麓的法海寺，是在十五世纪明朝英宗时代建筑的。这个寺院的壁画的风格具有奔放洒脱而工丽谨严的特点。壁画上面高达一百六十厘米的人物，长达二、三米的衣纹线条往往一气呵成，中间没有停滞的痕迹，有的在不足方寸之间的画面上，描绘出间不容发的细致。从画册中也可以看出壁画的着色技巧很高，画家们用“描金”和“沥粉贴金”的方法，造成金碧辉煌的气氛，这在现存的古代壁画遗迹中是很少见的。专家们认为，法海寺的壁画足以同莫高窟、永乐宫壁画比美，是我国古代壁画艺术中的?宝之一。
    民间木版年画是同广大人民生活联系最紧密的一种艺术，河北省原天津专区杨柳青地方是我国木版年画最早、最有代表性的产地之一。这次出版的“杨柳青年画资料集”，收集了明代以来数百年间反映当地人民生活情况和疾恶扬善的战斗精神的有代表性的年画九十多幅。这些年画取材很广，引人百看不厌。
    敦煌艺术遗产是四世纪到十四世纪当中，我国劳动人民的艺术结晶。“敦煌唐代图案选”收集的五十四幅图案，原来装饰在窟檐的柱梁、塑像的妆銮，以及壁画人物的衣着、武器和家具等上面的这些图饰与唐代的织锦、陶瓷、铜器的纹样相一致。它们在民族色彩和结构形式等方面，都反映了我国传统艺术的创造性。这对研究我们装饰艺术有着重要的参考价值。
    北京人民美术出版社还派专人到太原西南瓮山脚下拍摄了晋祠的宋塑，用珂?版印制出版了“晋祠宋塑选”。其中嫔侍的形象最为生动优美，婀娜多姿，是宋代雕塑艺术的精品。“南京六朝陶俑”图册，是根据南京地区清理的六朝墓葬遗物影印的。长期以来，南朝俑发现的很少，成为考古学中的空白点，这对六朝丧葬制度和官私奴婢问题的研究，提供了可靠的实物例证。
