Xinhua News Agency report: From January to August this year, a total of 103 large and medium-sized light industrial enterprises were completed nationwide, some of which have already been put into production. The completed enterprises include 29 machine-made paper mills, 16 sugar mills, 17 salt fields, and 41 factories producing glass, enamel, plastic products, watches, soap, hardened oil, alcohol, beer, etc. The annual production capacity added by the paper-making, sugar-making, and salt-making enterprises for the country is more than 80,000 tons, 270,000 tons, and 1.79 million tons respectively.

The paper-making industry is a key focus of light industry construction this year. The Wuhu Dongfang Paperboard Factory, which is partially in production, has a total production capacity of 50,000 tons per year and is currently the largest paperboard factory in China. The second phase of the Liaoyang Paperboard Factory, built this year, has a production capacity six times larger than the first phase. It will produce insulation paperboard, filter core paperboard, waterproof paperboard, carriage paperboard, and other products in large quantities to meet the needs of the electrical, automobile, and other industrial sectors. The construction of sugar mills is also one of the key points of light industry construction this year. The newly built Guangdong Sugarcane Chemical Plant is currently the largest comprehensive utilization joint enterprise of sugarcane in the country. It can crush 3,000 tons of sugarcane per day, produce 360 tons of sugar, and also use sugarcane residue to produce 40,000 tons of pulp per year, and use waste molasses to manufacture alcohol, yeast, and dry ice. The Fujian Xianyou Sugarcane Sugar Mill, Baoji Alcohol Factory, Urumqi Enamel Factory, Shanghai Watch Factory, Taiyuan Glass Factory, Hebei Dagu Salt Field, and Huanghua Salt Field have also been put into production.

These enterprises received assistance from fraternal countries during the construction process. The People's Republic of Poland provided the Guangdong Sugarcane Chemical Plant with the latest type of sugar-making equipment, and Polish experts provided guidance from site survey, design, construction, installation to trial operation. The Baoding Paper Mill was built with the assistance of the German Democratic Republic.

In the next four months, the light industry sector will also build 81 large and medium-sized projects. After these projects are completed, they can increase paper-making capacity by 220,000 tons and sugar-making capacity by more than 320,000 tons. In addition, all provinces and cities will continue to build a large number of small oil mills, sugar mills, and paper mills. These enterprises will be completed in batches by the end of this year or the first half of next year.

    轻工业部门大批生力军上阵
    八个月建成大中型企业一百零三个
    新华社讯　今年1月至8月份，全国共建成了一百零三个大中型轻工业企业，其中一部分已经投入生产。建成的企业包括机制纸厂二十九个，糖厂十六个，盐场十七个，玻璃、搪瓷、塑料制品、手表、肥皂、硬化油、酒精、啤酒等工厂四十一个。造纸、制糖、制盐企业每年为国家增加的生产能力分别是：八万多吨、二十七万吨、一百七十九万吨。
    造纸工业是今年轻工业建设的一个重点。部分投入生产的芜湖东方板纸厂，总的生产能力为年产五万吨，是我国目前最大的板纸厂。今年建设的辽阳板纸厂第二期工程，生产能力比第一期大六倍，它生产的绝缘板纸、滤芯板纸、防水板纸、车厢板纸等将大量供应电气、汽车等工业部门的需要。糖厂的建设也是今年轻工业建设重点之一。新建的广东甘蔗化工厂是目前全国最大的全面综合利用甘蔗的联合企业。它可以日榨三千吨甘蔗，生产三百六十吨食糖，还可以利用甘蔗渣每年生产四万吨纸浆，利用废糖蜜制造酒精、酵母和干冰。已经投入生产的还有福建仙游甘蔗糖厂、宝鸡酒精厂、乌鲁木齐搪瓷厂、上海手表厂、太原玻璃厂、河北大沽盐场、黄骅盐厂。
    这些企业在建设过程中，得到了兄弟国家的帮助。波兰人民共和国为广东甘蔗化工厂提供了最新型的制糖设备，从厂址勘察、设计、建筑、安装到试车运转，都有波兰专家指导。保定纸厂是在德意志民主共和国的帮助下建成的。
    今后四个月，轻工业部门还要建设八十一个大中型工程，这些工程建成后，可以增加造纸能力二十二万吨，制糖能力三十二万多吨。另外，各省市也要继续建设一大批小型油厂、糖厂、纸厂等。这些企业将分批分期在今年年底或明年上半年建成。
