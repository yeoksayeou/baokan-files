    Great Changes in One Year
    In just one year, the "blank sheet" of the Yingju Production Brigade has been filled with the "newest and most beautiful writing" and adorned with the "newest and most beautiful drawings"... By our reporter Chen Jian
    Last June, Comrade Mao Zedong introduced the Yingju Agricultural Production Cooperative of Fengqiu County, Henan Province, now the Yingju People's Commune's Yingju Production Brigade, to the people of the whole country in the first issue of the "Red Flag" magazine. In his article, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution." So, how is this previously impoverished production brigade doing now?
    This area is low-lying, with saline-alkali soil, subject to floods nine years out of ten; if it isn't flooded, it's drought. Before liberation, the masses "sweated it out in spring, summer, and autumn, only to beg for food in winter." In the years after liberation, they still relied on government relief grain. In 1957, under the leadership of the Party branch and inspired by the great leap forward, the masses of Yingju village bravely pursued their goals, proposing the heroic slogan of "Shedding the label of disaster area, shedding the label of low production." At this time, the masses of Yingju village were facing an unprecedented severe flood. But they no longer wanted any state loans or aid, instead, they pooled their wisdom and efforts to find dozens of ways to develop sideline production for self-salvation. At the same time, in such extremely difficult living conditions, in the severe cold where the ground was frozen solid, they launched a magnificent water conservancy movement. When Chairman Mao introduced them, they had already completed more than one hundred large and small reservoirs and canals three months ahead of schedule, achieving water conservancy and creating conditions for changing the natural landscape. More than a year has passed, and Yingju Village and the surrounding advanced agricultural cooperatives have merged to form the Yingju People's Commune, which is also one year old. In one year, this "blank sheet" has been filled with the newest and most beautiful writing and adorned with the newest and most beautiful drawings. Dear readers, let us open this picture of life!
            The First Stroke of Color
    When the reporter visited Yingju Village, it was the first day of the sixth lunar month. According to the local customs, this is a festival. In the morning, the women were given a holiday, and they received kneaded white flour and prepared fillings from the food supply department. The tempting aroma of chives and garlic juice wafted from every household. Cui Ruogu, the secretary of the brigade branch, said: "Life has fundamentally changed! Last year, the yield per mu was 820 jin, and the grain harvested by the whole team, calculated at an average of 500 jin per person per year, is enough to eat for four years. This year's wheat production has increased by more than 75%, and the autumn crops are growing even better than last year. This year, we will strive to become a team with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu!" A bunch of numbers from Cui Ruogu's mouth immediately danced before my eyes. A poor village, in one year, has crossed the Yellow River and caught up with the Yangtze River in terms of output, greatly ahead of schedule and overfulfilling the ten-year requirements of the agricultural development program, and realizing the grand vow of 800 jin per mu made in front of the leader last year. What a miracle! In the center of the street, Chairman Mao's article "Introducing a Cooperative" is prominently written on the wall. Around it, new business canteens, department stores, barber shops, clothing stores, nurseries, kindergartens, and red and expert schools have been built. The first batch of commune members has moved into a row of newly built residential areas with 120 rooms; the second residential area with 80 rooms will also be completed before National Day. In the credit cooperative and the "small banks" of several production teams, there are several equally gratifying figures – the savings of the commune members, with many households having 100 to 200 yuan, and some having 30 to 50 yuan.
    Two years ago, at this time of year, Yingju Village was either an endless flood or a vast expanse of cracked saline-alkali land. Now, it is a charming scene of the south of the Yangtze River: canals crisscross, fields are like paintings, fish swim in the ponds, and wisps of fragrance float from the lotus flowers. Women roll up their trouser legs and weed in the rice fields, from time to time emitting a crisp and melodious harvest ditty – all this is a true reflection of the life of the Yingju Brigade of the Yingju People's Commune today, that is, the first stroke of brilliant color that the heroes of this team have applied to the blank sheet in the first year after communization.
  “Rather toil than suffer” “Rather toil than suffer" is the battle call of the Yingju Brigade of the Yingju Commune to encourage themselves to work hard and forge ahead bravely. It was like this in the past difficult days, and now that life has improved, they must also work hard. Because people have higher ideals and wishes.
    In early July, it was the most intense time for autumn field management. Every day, before dawn, you could hear the sound of commune members going to the fields, and the sound of laughter; in the dim light of night, the commune members returned from the fields one after another. One night, the reporter and commune member Cui Xizhen returned from the field together. I asked him, "Don't you feel tired?" He said, "Tired of what? When people have goals in their hearts, when they have a prospect, they are not afraid to climb mountains of knives! You didn't see the scene of our village building water conservancy projects in 1957. When the shovel hit the ground, there was a clang, and a crack appeared in the hand. In the heavy snow, the cotton-padded jacket was gone, and it turned out to be buried underground by the heavy snow. At that time, the masses of the whole village had only one thought: to get rid of the label of disaster area..."
    No force can stop people from going to their destination. Here, the commune, the county, and the prefecture successively held on-site rice field management meetings in Yingju Village, and people unanimously praised the excellent rice management here. A year ago, no rice had been planted here. At that time, the seedlings were not planted in rows, the drainage ditches could not drain water, and when there were insects, they did not know where to start to control them. Even when the rice was ripe and ready to be harvested, they did not know to drain the water first. In a word: everything had to be learned from scratch. Some women usually couldn't stand for long, but in order to learn how to plant rice, they soaked their feet in the water, and they didn't complain, and they also guaranteed "not to withdraw from the front line until they learned to plant rice." Now, the women's rice experimental field is the most outstanding one in the whole commune and the whole brigade. The commune asked Cui Xizhen to take care of the canal drainage work for more than 2,000 mu of rice fields. The next day, people found a new thatched hut built next to the rice field, with a tattered mat and bedding roll inside. That was built overnight by Cui Xizhen. He said, "I want to grow with the first season of rice." From then on, for three months, he did not go home. In the early morning, commune members often saw him sleeping crookedly on the edge of the field, sometimes with his feet still soaking in the ditch.
    Keeping Pace
    As soon as the People's Commune was established, the Yingju Production Brigade developed faster, like seedlings receiving timely rain after a long drought. Many things that people did not dare to even think about in the past, such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, sewing factories, shoe factories, and flour mills, were born one by one amidst the sound of gongs and drums. More than 300 women with labor ability were freed from the stove and from trivial housework. Like birds out of a cage, they shook their wings and rushed to the production front. The extreme lack of labor in the past few years has improved. The entire production has become active. Under this new situation, the brigade party branch seriously considered such a question: in the past, production was all one-sided, either agriculture or sideline production, why can't we keep pace? The branch committee discussed for several nights, and under the unified arrangement and help of the commune party committee, it proposed a plan for the simultaneous development of agricultural and sideline production in 1959. The plan was handed over to the masses for discussion for three days and three nights, pushing the emotions of the commune members to a new peak. According to this plan, this production brigade of 1,000 people will have an average income of 200 yuan per person this year, more than double the income of the advanced agricultural cooperative before communization. At a discussion meeting, branch secretary Cui Ruogu said: "Maybe some people are worried: will we lose sight of both? No. With the women on the battlefront and with good natural conditions, we will strive to report good news on both fronts." From March to now, the income from salt and alkali alone has reached more than 40,000 yuan, the raising of livestock and poultry has increased four times compared with before communization, the wage income of commune members has increased ten times compared with the initial stage of communization, and continuous leaps have occurred in agricultural production.
    In the 50 days of intense summer harvesting and summer planting, sideline production never stopped for a day.
            Lofty Ideals
    The most profound impression Yingju Brigade gives people is the change in people's thoughts and feelings. They are a microcosm of the spiritual outlook of China's 500 million peasants. Under the leadership of the Party, they have stubbornly overcome difficulties and created today's life with labor and wisdom, but they are still so diligent and thrifty. Although every family has a deposit, no one has ever used a penny indiscriminately. They all say: the ideal is still far away! On the day the wages are paid, 70% to 80% are deposited in the credit cooperative. All the canteens here have a large supply of dried vegetables, ready for winter consumption. Each family saves a small amount from their rationed grain for personal needs, so as not to buy grain from the state. There is a female commune member named Guo Meilan. After communization, she sent her four children to the nursery and kindergarten, and she and her husband ate in the canteen. Last year, she worked more than 500 labor days. Now, she and her husband have more than 300 yuan in savings. But she only has two ragged cloth shirts, and her children's clothes are patched and sewn again and again, and she never easily adds a new piece of clothing. Why is this? She said: "Why did Chairman Mao value Yingju Cooperative? Because the people in our village are poor but ambitious, they have a long-term vision, and they know why they are suffering now. A year ago, we hoped for a life of having food and clothing. Now, we hope for a socialist life of happiness for everyone. Now, grit our teeth, add effort, and work hard for another ten or eight years, and when the country is strong, the commune is rich, and everyone's life will be better." How noble is this kind of thinking and feeling, its brilliance is magnificent and brilliant! This is the thinking and feeling of the Chinese people who have stood up. With it, we can overcome all difficulties and move forward bravely!

    一年巨变
    时间仅仅过去一年，在应举生产大队这张“白纸”上，已经写出了“最新最美的文字”，画出了“最新最美的画图”……	本报记者　陈健
    去年6月，毛泽东同志在第一期“红旗”杂志上，向全国人民介绍了河南省封丘县应举农业生产合作社，即现在的应举人民公社的应举生产大队。毛泽东同志的文章里说：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。”现在这个原先比较穷困的生产大队干得究竟如何呢？
    这里地势低洼，土质盐碱，十年九涝，不涝就旱。解放前群众是“春夏秋三季一头汗，到了冬季去要饭”。解放后的几年中，仍然靠吃政府的救济粮。1957年，应举村的群众在党支部的领导下，在大跃进的战鼓激励下，奋勇直追，提出：“摘掉灾区帽子，摘掉低产帽子”的英雄口号。应举村群众这时正面临着历史上从未出现过的特大水灾。但他们不再要国家的任何贷款和援助，而是群策群力，找出几十种副业生产的门路，生产自救。同时，在那样极端艰难的生活条件下，在地冻不能入刃的严寒里，展开了雄伟的水利化运动。毛主席介绍他们的时候，他们已经提早三个月完成一百多座大小水库和渠道，实现了水利化，为改变自然面貌创造了条件。一年多过去了，应举村和周围的高级农业合作社合并成立了应举人民公社，也一周年了。一年中，这张“白纸”上，已经写出了最新最美的文字，画出了最新最美的画图。亲爱的读者，让我们打开这幅生活的画图吧！
            第一笔色彩
    记者到应举村访问时，正是阴历六月初一。按照当地群众的习俗，这是个节日。上午，妇女们放假，从饮食供应部领到揉好的白面和盘好的馅子。诱人的韭黄和蒜汁的鲜味，从家家户户飘出来。大队支部书记崔若谷说：“生活根本变啦！去年每亩产粮八百二十斤，全队收的粮食，按平均每人每年吃五百斤计算，可以吃四年。今年小麦增产75％以上，秋庄稼比去年长的更好，今年要争取成为亩产千斤队呢！”崔若谷口中的一堆数目字，立即在我眼前跳动起来。一个穷村，一年的时间在产量上跨越了黄河，赶过了长江，大大提前超额完成农业发展纲要十年的要求，实现了去年在领袖面前立下的亩产八百斤的宏伟誓愿，这是怎样的奇迹呀！在街的中央，毛主席的“介绍一个合作社”的文章，醒目地写在墙上。它的周围新盖起了营业食堂、百货商店、理发店、成衣店、托儿所、幼儿园、红专学校等。一排新落成的一百二十间房屋的居民点，已经搬进了第一批社员；第二个居民点八十间，国庆节前也要落成。信用社和几个生产小队的“小银行”里，有几笔同样令人欣喜的数目字——社员的存款，每户多者一、二百元，少者三、五十元。
    两年前，应举村在这个季节，不是无边无际的洪水，就是白茫茫一片龟裂的盐碱地。现在却是一番迷人的江南景象：渠道纵横，阡陌如画，池塘游鱼如织，荷花丛中飘出缕缕清香。妇女们卷起裤管在稻田里拔草，不时传出清脆悦耳的丰收小调——这一切就是应举人民公社应举大队今天的生活写照，也就是这个队的英雄们在公社化后的第一年中，在白纸上抹下的第一笔绚烂的色彩。
  “宁愿苦干，不愿苦熬”“宁愿苦干，不愿苦熬”，这是应举公社应举大队激励自己奋发苦干、勇猛直前的战斗号角。在过去的艰难日月中如此，现在，生活有了好转，也要苦干。因为人们有更高的理想和愿望。
    7月上旬，正是秋田管理最紧张的日子。每天天不太亮，就听见社员下地的脚步声，欢笑声；夜色朦胧中，社员才陆续从地里回来。有一天夜里，记者和社员崔希真一道从地里回来。我问他：“你不觉得累吗？”他说：“累啥？人心里有了目标，有了奔头，上刀山也不怕！你没见俺村1957年兴修水利工程的情景，铁锹打在地上，当啷一响，手上裂了口子。下着大雪，脱下的棉袄不见了，原来是被大雪埋在地下了。那时，全村群众只有一个念头：要摘掉灾区帽子。……”
    没有任何力量能阻止人们奔赴自己的目的地。在这里，社里、县里、专区接二连三地在应举村召开稻田管理现场会议，人们一致称赞这里的水稻管理得出色。一年以前，这里没有栽过水稻。那时，插秧不成行，排水沟排不出水，有了虫不知道从哪里下手治。甚至于当稻子已经成熟要收割的时候，还不知把水先排出来。一句话：都要从头学。有些妇女平时站久了，就吃不住；可是，为了学会插秧，把脚泡在水里，她们也不叫苦，还保证“不学会插秧，不下火线。”现在，妇女的水稻试验田是全公社全大队最出色的一块。社里让崔希让看管二千多亩稻田的渠道排水工作，第二天，人们发现在稻田旁边新搭起了一间草屋，里面有一条破席和铺盖卷，那是崔希让一夜盖起来的。他说：“我要和第一季水稻一块生长。”从那时起，有三个月的时间，他没有回过家。清晨，社员们经常看见他歪在地头睡着了，有时两只脚还泡在水沟里。
    齐头并进
    人民公社一成立，应举生产大队像旱禾适逢喜雨，发展得更快了。许多过去使人连想也不敢想的事物，像公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、缝纫厂、鞋厂、磨面厂等，在一片锣鼓喧天声中，一一诞生了。三百多名有劳动能力的妇女，从锅台边，从琐碎的家务中解脱出来，她们像出笼的鸟儿，抖擞着翅膀，飞奔向生产战线。几年来极端缺乏劳力的情况，得到了好转。整个生产活跃起来了。大队党支部在这种新的形势下，认真考虑这样一个问题：过去生产都是单打一，不是农业就是副业，为什么不能齐头并进呢？支委会讨论了几个晚上，在公社党委的统一安排和帮助下，提出了1959年农副业生产同时发展的计划。计划交给群众讨论了三天三夜，把社员的情绪推到新的高峰。根据这个计划，这个一千人口的生产大队，今年平均每人将有二百元的收入，比公社化前的高级农业社时，收入增加一倍多。在一次讨论会上，支部书记崔若谷说：“也许有人耽心：会不会两头抓瞎呢？不会。妇女都上了阵，又有很好的自然条件，我们要争取在两条战线上同传捷报。”从3月份到现在，仅盐碱一项收入即达四万多元，家畜家禽的饲养比公社化前增加四倍，社员的工资收入比公社化初期提高十倍，而且在农业生产上出现了连续跃进的局面。
    在五十天紧张的夏收夏种中，副业生产一天也没有停止。
            远大的理想
    应举大队给人最深刻的印象是人的思想感情的变化。他们是中国五亿农民精神面貌的缩影。他们在党的领导下，顽强地战胜困难，用劳动和智慧创造了今天的生活，但他们仍然是那么勤俭和节约。尽管每个家庭都有了一笔存款，但从没有人乱用分文。他们都说：离理想还远哪！工资发下的当天，百分之七、八十都存入信用社。这里所有食堂都存有大批的干菜，准备冬天食用。每个家庭，都在自己的定量用粮中，节余少许，以备个人急需，省得向国家买粮。有一个叫郭美兰的女社员，公社化后，她把四个孩子送到托儿所和幼儿园，自己和丈夫在食堂吃饭。去年她做了五百多个劳动日。现在，她和她的丈夫已经有三百多元的存款。可是她只有两件破布衫，她的孩子的衣服，补了又补，缝了又缝，从不轻易添件新衣。为什么这样呢？她说：“毛主席为啥看中应举社？因为俺村人穷志不短，眼光看的远，知道眼前为啥吃苦。一年前，俺们盼有吃有穿的日子，如今盼的是社会主义人人幸福的生活。现在咬咬牙，加把劲，再苦干它十年八载，国家强了，公社富了，每个人的生活也就好了。”这种思想感情多么高尚，它的光辉绚丽灿烂！这是站起来了的中国人民的思想感情，有了它，就能够战胜一切困难，勇往直前！
