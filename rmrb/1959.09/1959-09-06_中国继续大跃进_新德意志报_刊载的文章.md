Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th - "Neues Deutschland" published an article on August 28th by Erich Henschke, a correspondent for the German News Agency in Beijing, entitled "China Continues Great Leap Forward." The full text is as follows:

What level has China's economy currently reached? What tasks can and must be put forward? These questions were the focus of discussions at the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee and the Supreme State Conference convened by Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, a few days ago.

The starting point for all these considerations is the economic achievements made in the first half of 1959. Industrial production increased by 65% compared to the same period last year.

The completion and overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan laid the foundation for China's socialist industrialization. In 1958—the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan—the national economy developed rapidly at an unprecedented Great Leap Forward speed. For example, the value of industrial and handicraft output reached 117 billion yuan, an increase of 66% over 1957.

	Victorious Struggle Against Drought

It must be taken into account the very unfavorable natural disasters this year. Some areas have suffered from floods and droughts. Since June of this year, large areas of cultivated land in Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Hunan provinces have suffered from drought. Since August, sixteen more provinces have suffered from drought. The total drought-affected area is nearly 21 million hectares, and millions of people in these areas are engaged in arduous, selfless, but successful struggles.

The impact of the natural disasters has been basically contained. 60% of the disaster-stricken land, more than 13 million hectares of cultivated land, has been able to obtain artificial irrigation.

In old China, such serious natural disasters would inevitably cause millions of people to starve, tens of thousands of peasant families to leave their homes and beg for food, and for countless people, such disasters would mean death. But in today's Chinese countryside, there is no despair at all. From October 1957 to September 1958 alone, another 480 million mu (32 million hectares) of land were incorporated into the irrigation and drainage system and are now benefiting. In the old China under reactionary rule, at most only 230 million mu of land had been irrigated for hundreds of years.

In 1957, about 31% of the cultivated land benefited from the widespread irrigation system, and now 60% of the land has been irrigated.

The massive disaster relief struggle carried out by millions of peasants has shown great results, because the People's Communes can effectively arrange labor and production tools even in these difficult days.

The danger has not been completely eliminated, but today it can be asserted that the harvest of summer crops in the first half of 1959 was somewhat higher than last year. Overall, the economic situation in the first half of 1959 was good, and this year has all the favorable conditions to continue the Great Leap Forward on the basis of last year.

		Breakneck Speed

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China frankly—which convincingly illustrates the strong relationship of trust between the Party and the people—believes that last year's output estimates were too high due to a lack of experience in estimating such an unprecedented bumper harvest. After verification, the actual grain harvest in 1958 was about 500 billion jin.

This output is 35% higher than in 1957. The verified cotton output increased by 28% compared to 1957, while the grain growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan was 3.7% and cotton was 4.7%. It must be clearly pointed out that even these finally determined yields provide strong evidence for the speed of rapid development, the speed of the Great Leap Forward.

In 1958, steel production reached 11.08 million tons, of which 8 million tons were high-quality steel produced by modern metallurgical industries to meet industrial needs, and the remaining 3.08 million tons were steel produced by indigenous methods. In the future, local governments will decide how much steel to produce using indigenous methods based on local conditions. This product will continue to play a major role in developing local industries and manufacturing simple agricultural implements, but will no longer be included in the national plan. Based on this situation, it is recommended that the output of high-quality steel in the 1959 plan be increased from 8 million tons to 12 million tons, and coal production should be increased by 65 million tons compared to 1958.

			The Path is Clear

The finally determined 1959 plan will prove the power of the general line of building socialism, indicating that the plan is fully adapted to the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical." The 1959 plan is in line with the realistic assessment of objective laws, and is especially suitable for fully promoting the great enthusiasm and creativity of the Chinese people. This plan points out a steady path for continuing the Great Leap Forward. Of course, this requires overcoming all right-leaning conservatism and opportunist tendencies. The completion of the 1959 plan will take a decisive step towards achieving the important task of surpassing Britain in the output of important industrial products in about ten years.

Capitalist countries spent more than fifty years on their industrialization, and some countries even spent one hundred to one hundred and fifty years, while socialist China is industrializing at breakneck speed in order to finally get rid of poverty and backwardness—the legacy of imperialism and semi-feudal oppression. With the completion of the 1959 plan, the production targets for steel, coal, timber, metallurgical and power equipment, paper, grain, cotton, and other products in the Second Five-Year Plan will be close to being reached this year, and some will even be fully reached.

			China No Longer Sleeps

Now perhaps it is necessary to cite just a few facts from many to advise Western professional propagandists and gullible people who are in danger of being fooled.

People's China produced about 270 million tons of coal last year, which already exceeds Britain (about 50 million tons). Coal production will increase by 24% in 1959.

Britain already produced 37 million tons of coal in 1840. A century later (1936), China only produced 39 million tons of coal, while Britain had already produced 232.1 million tons of coal. The growth rate of coal mining in People's China reached an annual growth of 19% during the First Five-Year Plan. Since then, the amount of coal mined in 1957 has reached 58.5% of Britain's annual output. In 1959, China will mine 335 million tons of coal.

It took almost two centuries for British industry to reach its current level. In 1880, it produced steel equivalent to People's China's steel production in 1952, namely 1.38 million tons. In 1949, China produced 158,000 tons of steel, exactly 1% of British steel production. Britain produced 5.12 million tons of steel in 1903, roughly equivalent to the People's Republic of China's production in 1957.

The level of production reached by China during the First Five-Year Plan took Britain twenty-three years. The average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan was 31.5%. Last year alone, China produced 49.5% more steel than the 5.35 million tons in 1957.

"Let China sleep, for if China wakes, the world will regret it." The reactionary American magazine "Time" believes that it is necessary to recall Napoleon's saying. No one will stop the imperialists from sighing for the inevitable collapse of their "world." The people of the world express their respect and praise for the 650 million Chinese people who are firmly and irresistibly building socialism in their powerful homeland.

    中国继续大跃进
    “新德意志报”刊载的文章
    新华社柏林5日电　“新德意志报”8月28日刊载了德意志通讯社驻北京记者埃里希·汉希克写的一篇题为“中国继续大跃进”的文章。全文如下：
    中国的经济目前发展到怎样的水平了呢？哪些任务是能够提出并且必须提出的呢？这些问题是几天以前中共八中全会和中华人民共和国主席刘少奇召集的最高国务会议讨论的中心。
    这一切考虑的出发点是1959年上半年达到的经济成就。工业生产与去年同时期比较增长了65％。
    第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成奠定了中国社会主义工业化的基础。在1958年——第二个五年计划的第一年——国民经济以史无前例的大跃进的速度迅速发展。比如工业和手工业的产值达到一千一百七十亿元，比1957年增加了66％。
        胜利的抗旱斗争
    必须估计到今年非常不利的天灾。一些地区遭到了水灾和旱灾。今年6月以来，山西、河南、陕西和湖南等省的大片耕地遭到了旱灾。从8月以来，又有十六个省遭到了旱灾。总计受旱面积将近二千一百万公顷，千百万人们在这些地区进行着艰苦的、忘我的但是成功的斗争。
    天灾的影响基本上受到了制止。60％的受灾土地，一千三百多万公顷以上的耕地已能得到人工灌溉。
    要是在旧中国，这样严重的天灾必然使千百万人挨饿，成千上万的农民家庭离乡背井，四出讨饭，对无数的人来说，这种灾害就意味着死亡。可是在今天的中国农村里根本没有出现绝望的情绪。仅从1957年10月到1958年9月，又有四亿八千万亩（三千二百万公顷）土地被列入排灌系统，现在已经收到效益。在反动统治下的旧中国，数百年来顶多只有二亿三千万亩地得到灌溉。
    1957年约有31％的耕地受到了广布的灌溉系统的益处，现在已有60％的土地得到了灌溉。
    千百万农民大军进行的巨大的抗灾斗争已经显示出巨大的成果，因为人民公社就是在这些艰苦的日子里也能有效地安排了劳动和生产工具。
    危险尚未完全消除，但是今天已能断言，1959年上半年夏收作物的收获量比去年有一定程度的增长。总的看来，1959年上半年的经济情况是好的，今年具备一切有利的条件，在去年的基础上继续大跃进。
                飞快的速度
    中国共产党中央委员会坦白地——这令人信服地说明了共产党和人民之间的牢固的信赖关系——认为，由于在估计这样一个从未有过的丰收的时候缺乏经验，去年产量估算偏高。经核实之后，1958年谷物实际收获量约为五千亿斤。
    这个产量比1957年提高35％。经核实后的棉花产量比1957年增加28％，而第一个五年计划期间粮食增长率为3.7％，棉花为4.7％。必须明确地指出，就是这些最后确定的产量也为迅速发展的速度、大跃进的速度提供了一个有力的证明。
    1958年钢产量达到一千一百零八万吨，其中八百万吨为现代化设备的冶金工业生产出来满足工业需要的优质钢，其余的三百零八万吨是土法生产的土钢。今后地方政府在考虑当地的情况下自己决定生产多少土钢。这种产品在发展地方工业和制造简单农具方面也将继续起重大作用，但不再列入国家计划。根据这种情况，建议在1959年计划中确定优质钢的产量从八百万吨提高到一千二百万吨，煤产量应比1958年增加六千五百万吨。
              道路是清楚的
    最后确定的1959年的计划将证明建设社会主义的总路线的力量，表明计划完全适应“多、快、好、省”的原则。1959年的计划符合对客观规律的实事求是的估计，尤其适合充分发扬中国人民的伟大的积极性和创造性。这个计划指出了一条继续大跃进的稳健途径。当然这有待克服一切右倾保守和机会主义的倾向。完成1959年的计划就将在十年左右实现在重要工业产品产量上超过英国的重要任务方面迈出决定性的一步。
    资本主义国家为自己的工业化花费了五十多年时间，有些国家甚至花费了一百年至一百五十年的时间，而社会主义中国是用飞快的速度进行工业化，以便最终地摆脱贫穷与落后——帝国主义和半封建压迫的遗产。完成了1959年的计划，第二个五年计划中的钢、煤、木材、冶金和发电设备、纸、粮食、棉花和其它产品的生产指标也就将在今年接近达到，部分甚至完全达到。
                中国不再沉睡
    现在也许应该从许多事实中仅仅举出几件来奉劝西方职业宣传家和有上当危险的轻信的人。
    人民中国去年煤产量约二亿七千万吨，这已经超过英国（约五千万吨）。1959年煤产量将增加24％。
    英国在1840年已经产煤三千七百万吨。一个世纪以后（1936）中国才产煤三千九百万吨，而那时英国已产煤二亿三千二百一十万吨。人民中国采煤的增长率在第一个五年计划期间达到每年增长19％。此后，1957年采煤量已达到英国年产量的58.5％。1959年中国采煤量将为三亿三千五百万吨。
    英国的工业达到它现在的水平经历几乎了两个世纪的时间。在1880年它生产的钢已经相当于人民中国1952年的钢产量，即一百三十八万吨。1949年中国产钢十五万八千吨，恰好为英国钢产量的1％。英国在1903年产钢五百十二万吨，约相当中华人民共和国1957年的产量。
    在第一个五年计划期间中国所达到的生产水平，在英国需要二十三年。第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长率为31.5％。单是去年中国生产的洋钢就比1957年的五百三十五万吨增加了49.5％。
    “让中国沉睡吧，假如中国醒来，世界将会后悔的。”美国反动的“时代”杂志认为，回忆拿破仑说的这句话是必要的。没有人会阻止帝国主义者为他们的“世界”必然崩溃而叹息。世界各国人民对六亿五千万中国人民稳固地和以不可阻挡之势在他们强大的国土上建设社会主义表示尊敬和赞扬。
