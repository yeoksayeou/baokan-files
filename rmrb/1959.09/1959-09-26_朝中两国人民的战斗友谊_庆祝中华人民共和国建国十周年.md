    The Korean people, together with the 650 million brotherly Chinese people and all progressive people of the world, greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with joy and excitement.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China are fundamental changes in Chinese history and the greatest international event demonstrating the invincible vitality of Marxism-Leninism since the Great October Revolution. From this time on, the Chinese people, who had long been exploited and oppressed by foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary forces, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, grasped political power for the first time in history and embarked on the road of creating a new socialist life.
    The Chinese people, accounting for about a quarter of the world's population, broke away from the shackles of imperialism and embarked on the path of socialism, dealing a heavy blow to the world's imperialist forces and greatly strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution broke the largest link in the imperialist colonial system and greatly promoted the liberation struggle of the oppressed people of the world.
    The disastrous defeat of the US imperialists and their running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, on the Chinese mainland fundamentally transformed the Asian situation in favor of peace and socialism. The People's Republic of China has become a strong fortress for the liberation struggle of the Asian people, opening up a new and broad road for the Asian people to ascend the international stage more powerfully.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China gave tremendous strength to the Korean people who were fighting for the freedom, independence, and socialism of their motherland, making them more determined in their confidence in victory.
    Our country has the great Soviet Union and powerful socialist China as neighbors, which is a reliable guarantee for our people to achieve victory.
    Today, the peoples of Korea and China are close brothers in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. Our two countries are closely united and working together for the common great cause of peace and socialism.
    The friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China has a long history and has been strengthened and developed through arduous struggles.
    The peoples of Korea and China have forged a close friendship over the long years of history, and have helped each other in the common struggle against foreign aggressors. In particular, the militant friendship between the peoples of Korea and China has been further strengthened in the common struggle against the fierce Japanese imperialist aggression and plunder.
    While occupying Korea and cruelly oppressing and plundering the Korean people, Japanese imperialism turned the Korean Peninsula into a bridgehead for invading the continent, directly pointing the spearhead of aggression at the Chinese mainland.
    Entering the 1930s, Japanese imperialism further extended its aggressive claws to the Chinese mainland, further strengthening its plunder and oppression. As a result, the peoples of Korea and China more closely launched a common struggle against Japanese imperialism and developed the struggle to a higher stage.
    Korean communists and Chinese comrades organized the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and with the northern border area of our country and the northeastern region of China as the center, widely launched the anti-Japanese armed struggle. In this struggle, the Korean guerrillas received enthusiastic support and assistance from the Chinese people, and shared weal and woe with them.
    In the struggle against the aggressors and their running dogs, the peoples of Korea and China deeply realized that the destinies of the two peoples are closely linked and inseparable.
    The struggle of the peoples of Korea and China against Japanese imperialism was carried out under the red banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism by the oppressed working masses, led by the working class of the two countries. Our patriots often drew infinite strength and courage from the prosperity and strength of the Soviet Union, the center of the international workers' movement and the great fortress, and were convinced in any difficult environment that Marxism-Leninism would surely win and imperialism would surely perish. This common struggle of the peoples of Korea and China continued until 1945, when the Japanese imperialism was destroyed due to the decisive role of the great Soviet army. During this long historical period, the glorious tradition of internationalist solidarity and cooperation between the peoples of Korea and China was formed.
    After the Korean people were liberated from Japanese imperialist colonial rule by relying on the Soviet army, the Chinese revolution also achieved victory, and thus the friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China developed to a new and higher stage. The traditional friendship between the two peoples has been fully developed.
    The great vitality of the friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China was gloriously demonstrated in the Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people against the armed aggression of the US imperialists and their running dog, the Lee Seung-man bandit gang.
    The brotherly Chinese people, together with the people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, resolutely condemned the US imperialist armed aggression against the Korean people, actively supported the struggle of the Korean people, and demonstrated the unbreakable internationalist friendship with the Korean people.
    In particular, during the most difficult period for our people, the Chinese people, holding high the banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, sent the Volunteer Army composed of their own outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean front.
    The People's Republic of China was at the initial stage of its founding at this time and had many difficulties; however, the brotherly Chinese people, who were as close to our people as flesh and blood, with the firm determination to share weal and woe with the Korean people, unanimously mobilized to eliminate the common enemy. The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers infinitely inspired our people and our People's Army, and fundamentally reversed the Korean war situation in our favor.
    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side, inflicting devastating blows on the enemy who had penetrated into the northern half of our country, and drove them out of the entire northern half of the republic. The US imperialists suffered repeated defeats in the face of the power of the unity between the peoples of Korea and China, and finally had to bow their heads to the peoples of Korea and China and sign the armistice agreement.
    The Korean War, which lasted for more than three years, was one of the most intense and cruel wars in history. In this cruel war, the unparalleled revolutionary heroism demonstrated by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the solid unity formed between the peoples of Korea and China are a vivid example of the spirit of proletarian internationalism.
    The Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: The Chinese People's Volunteers should cherish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Korean Workers' Party, and the Korean people as they cherish their own country, their own party, and their own people; they should cherish every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people – the Volunteer Army warriors – faithfully carried out this instruction of their party and leader, and maintained the honor of internationalist warriors in any difficult environment.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers who participated in the Korean War, with the spirit of defending every inch of their own country, defended every highland and village in Korea with the Korean People's Army with blood, and demonstrated unparalleled heroic spirit and collective heroism in the struggle with the enemy. Hero Huang Jiguang left a last word: "The enemy's bullets may take my life, but they must never take the lives of the beloved Korean brothers." He used his chest to block the enemy's gun muzzle, ensuring the victory of our army. This is the most vivid example of the revolutionary heroism demonstrated by the Chinese People's Volunteers, which is thoroughly based on the spirit of proletarian internationalism. All the Volunteer Army warriors, with this spirit, dedicated everything most precious to them in the battle for the victory of the Korean people.
    After the Chinese People's Volunteers participated in the Korean War, many combat heroes and collective meritorious units emerged during the two years and nine months of fierce fighting. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded the title of Republic Hero to many comrades such as Huang Jiguang and Yang Gensi in recognition of their outstanding achievements, and awarded medals and badges to many Volunteer Army warriors.
    The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers were outstanding embodiments of noble moral qualities. In the harsh environment of the battle, they plowed the land with our farmers for sowing and harvesting. When the US imperialists carried out barbaric bombings, they risked their lives to rescue the lives and property of many of our people; they also saved their own military rations to help many war victims in our country. The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and our people formed a deep friendship and a beautiful relationship of selflessness and mutual assistance.
    Chinese People's Volunteer Army martyr Luo Shengjiao bravely jumped into an ice cave in the bitter winter to rescue the life of a Korean boy, sacrificing his precious youth. Korean farmer Park Jae-geun shielded Volunteer Army wounded with his own body from enemy bullets and gloriously sacrificed himself. Such examples during the Korean War are too numerous to mention.
    All the Chinese people actively participated in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, providing material and spiritual assistance to the Korean people in battle. The Chinese people annually supported the Korean people with huge amounts of grain and other relief supplies, and raised more than 20,000 war orphans in our country as if they were their own children.
    The result of the three years of fierce Korean War was the victory of the peoples of Korea and China.
    The Chinese people assisted the Korean people's just struggle for freedom and independence with blood, established immortal feats in ensuring the historical victory of the Korean people, and made great contributions to the cause of restoring peace in Korea and defending peace in the East.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army and all the Korean people, defeated the armed aggression of the international reactionaries – the US imperialists and their vassal states, and thoroughly exposed the myth of the so-called "US imperialist power." This is not only a great victory for the peoples of Korea and China, but also a historical victory for the oppressed people and peace-loving people of the world.
    The victory of the peoples of Korea and China in the Korean War shattered the US imperialists' aggressive conspiracy to provoke a new world war, gave a fatal blow to their "policy of strength," and infinitely inspired the national liberation struggles of the Eastern peoples and the struggles of the people of the world to defend peace.
    In the Korean War, the US imperialists not only suffered a disastrous military defeat, but also suffered a shameful defeat politically and morally. Their inhuman and barbaric atrocities as an important means were a concrete manifestation of the corruption and hatred of mankind at the end of the imperialist century, and were hated and cursed by the people of the world.
    The victory achieved by the peoples of Korea and China in the Korean War demonstrated to the world the superiority of the socialist system and the invincible power of the socialist camp united under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.
    The Korean War showed the unyielding fighting spirit and infinite revolutionary strength of the awakened new Asian people of socialism, and clearly stated that if the aggressors want to invade the people of the socialist camp countries, then they must suffer a disastrous defeat under the collective counterattack of the people of the socialist countries. This made the people of all countries in the socialist camp in the world more determined in their confidence in victory, and made great contributions to further strengthening the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The great achievements established by the brotherly Chinese people in the war of the Korean people against US imperialist armed aggression will be forever recorded in the annals of progressive mankind.
    After the armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with our People's Army, continued to firmly defend our country's peaceful defense line, and did everything possible to make the armistice lead to a consolidated peace. However, the US imperialists and their running dogs, who continue to occupy South Korea, violently violate the armistice agreement, frequently create provocative acts, and plot various sinister conspiracies in an attempt to sabotage the peaceful socialist construction of our people. The Chinese People's Volunteers, together with our people, firmly defended the peaceful labor of the Korean people, preventing it from being invaded by the enemy, and carried out unremitting struggles to smash the enemy's provocative plots and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea.
    At the same time, they also actively helped the Korean people to carry out the difficult post-war recovery and construction. The Volunteer Army warriors eliminated all difficulties and spared no sacrifice, exerted all their strength to help the Korean people eliminate suffering and misfortune, and ensure their future happiness. In order to promote the construction of our socialist new life, the Volunteer Army warriors helped the construction of Korean cities and villages with all sincerity, just like building their own motherland's cities and towns.
    The Volunteer Army warriors personally built many houses and public buildings in our country, restored and repaired the Daedong Bridge in Pyongyang and many other bridges. They also participated in the construction of many irrigation projects, reservoirs, and river management projects that are of great significance in accelerating the development of our rural economy, and established great labor achievements.
    For eight years, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people shared life and death and established immortal feats. According to the proposal of the governments of Korea and China in 1958, they decided to withdraw from Korea. As of the end of October 1958, the Korean people bid farewell to their closest friends – the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers – who returned to their motherland with unforgettable gratitude.
    All the Korean people, regardless of gender, age, sincerely and warmly expressed their gratitude and respect to the brotherly Chinese people and the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army and will always remember the glorious and great achievements left by the Volunteer Army warriors.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers' voluntary withdrawal from Korea is of great significance in promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea and easing the tense situation in Asia.
    The withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is a manifestation of the Chinese people's consistent and sincere efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.
    The militant friendship between the peoples of Korea and China, forged with blood in the long-term struggle against the common enemy, is further consolidated and developed in the struggle of the peoples of the two countries to build socialism today, and further demonstrates great vitality.
    The brotherly Chinese people, together with the Soviet Union and the people of other socialist countries, have consistently given our people tremendous economic and technical assistance.
    Due to the war, our people's economy was severely damaged, and during the period when the people's lives were extremely impoverished, that is, during the most difficult period of post-war recovery and construction, the Chinese people gave our people 800 million yuan (current currency) in gratuitous assistance.
    This precious assistance from the Chinese people has blossomed and borne fruit in our cities and villages, which have been rebuilt from ruins with new faces, and in all aspects of our people's thriving life.
    The People's Republic of China is still constantly giving tremendous assistance to our country's socialist construction. This assistance has made a great contribution to promoting our country's socialist construction and further improving the lives of our people.
    In socialist construction, mutual assistance and cooperation between the peoples of Korea and China are constantly expanding and developing.
    In this regard, the Agreement on Economic and Cultural Cooperation signed between Korea and China in November 1953 plays a huge role. According to this agreement, our two countries widely exchange materials and raw materials needed for socialist construction, closely cooperate in developing science and technology, and at the same time continuously expand cultural exchanges and exchange experiences in socialist construction.
    In the five years after the war (1954-1958), the trade volume between Korea and China increased by about seventeen times.
    Currently, the peoples of our two countries are working together on the Yalu River to build a modern large-scale hydroelectric power station. The Chinese people have also given our country the machinery and equipment needed for the construction of a series of factories such as the Sinuiju Textile Union Factory and the Huishan Paper Mill, as well as materials and raw materials needed for the development of our industry.
    As the development history of the world socialist system proves, it is of great significance for the brotherly countries to exchange experiences in socialist revolution and socialist construction with each other. The Korean people often absorb the rich experiences of the Soviet Union, China, and other brotherly countries in building socialism, and draw great inspiration from it.
    Korea and China were both colonial and semi-colonial countries in the past, and both inherited the backward economy and culture left over from the old society. There are many commonalities in the socialist construction of our two countries.
    Our two countries often send economic and cultural delegations to each other, and through the party newspapers and various news publishing agencies of the two countries, we widely introduce to our own people all the achievements made by the other party in socialist construction and exchange the experiences accumulated in socialist construction.
    The development of this economic and cultural cooperation further strengthens the friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China and further promotes the common prosperity of the two countries.
    Through the common struggle against aggression and close cooperation in socialist construction, the mutual understanding, trust, and love between our two parties, two governments, and two peoples have been further deepened. Our two peoples feel infinitely happy about all the victories of our own people as the common victory of the two peoples, and are inspired by it.
    In recent years, the visit of the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China to our country and the visit of our government delegation to China clearly demonstrate the unbreakable friendship and unity of our two peoples.
    The friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China is a new relationship between peoples that can only be seen in the socialist camp family headed by the Soviet Union, a new relationship that arises from common social systems, ideas, and fighting goals, and a new relationship based on complete equality, mutual respect, and fraternal cooperation based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.
    This friendship and solidarity is constantly consolidated together with the strengthening and development of the socialist camp and the victory of the socialist construction of our two countries, which cannot be destroyed by any force. The Korean people infinitely cherish the friendship and solidarity with the brotherly Chinese people and will do everything possible to further develop this friendship and solidarity.
    Today, the peoples of our two countries are strengthening cooperation with the people of all socialist countries, and strengthening mutual cooperation between our two countries, and together are launching an unprecedented high tide in socialist construction.
    The brotherly Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have made tremendous achievements in socialist construction. The socialist transformation has been successfully carried out in Chinese cities and villages, and at the same time, an unprecedented great leap forward has been launched in all sectors of socialist construction. Last year, China's industrial production increased by nearly 70%, and grain and other agricultural products achieved bumper harvests.
    The political and economic power of the People's Republic of China has been unprecedentedly strengthened, and the material and cultural living standards of the Chinese people have been further improved. All the Chinese people are giving full play to their high labor enthusiasm and political enthusiasm along the general line of socialist construction pointed out by the Chinese Communist Party, and are carrying out technical revolution and cultural revolution to further accelerate socialist construction. Today, the People's Republic of China is rapidly transforming into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.
    Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people have restored the damaged people's economy in a short period of time after the war and are confidently advancing towards the peak of socialism. In all sectors of our people's economy, the only socialist production relations have been established, and the system of exploitation of man by man has been eliminated. Productive forces are developing rapidly, and people's lives have been further improved.
    In the five years after the war, our country's industrial production has increased by an average of 42% annually, and increased by 75% in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year. Our country has completed the industrial total output value plan of the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule by the end of June this year.
    Our people are constantly making new and greater achievements in socialist construction. In the near future, our country will transform into a developed socialist industrial country.
    A vast road is unfolding before the peoples of Korea and China, that is, overcoming the backwardness left over from their national history, successfully carrying out socialist construction, and marching forward together with the people of all brotherly countries towards the ideal of mankind – communist society. Comrade Khrushchev's assertion that socialist countries will effectively use the possibilities inherent in the socialist system to transition to the advanced stage of communist society at roughly the same time inspires the peoples of our two countries to launch a new labor struggle.
    The high tide of socialist construction in Korea and China truly proves that the people who have been liberated from exploitation and oppression and have become the masters of their own destiny can certainly exert infinite creative power in the struggle to build a new life. The people of our two countries have long been subjected to the cruel exploitation and oppression of foreign aggressors, landlords, and capitalists, have suffered indescribable pain, and lived in poverty, and now, in order to make their backward countries join the ranks of advanced countries, and in order to quickly change the backward living conditions, they are unreservedly exerting their energy and talent. They are full of firm confidence in victory in their just cause. No force can destroy the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, and no force can stop their progress.
    The victorious unfolding of the socialist construction of our two countries and the strengthening of the friendship and unity of our two peoples form a huge force for finally expelling the imperialist aggressive forces in Asia, maintaining lasting peace, and ensuring the victory of socialism.
    Ignoring the unanimous protests and condemnations of all the Asian people and the peace-loving people of the world, the US imperialists continue to occupy the southern half of our country, brutally plunder and oppress the South Korean people, and turn South Korea into a living hell of hunger and poverty. The US imperialists are moving various new weapons such as atomic weapons and missiles into South Korea, and are turning South Korea into a military base for provoking a new war.
    The US imperialists are occupying Taiwan and daring to carry out aggressive and provocative acts against the Chinese people, constantly creating tension in the Taiwan Strait.
    The peoples of Korea and China are directly confronting this fierce and common enemy and launching a tense struggle.
    In order to ensure the final disastrous defeat of the enemy, and to strive for the final victory of the freedom, independence, peace, and socialism of the Asian people, the peoples of our two countries continue to resolutely launch a struggle against the common enemy.
    Premier Zhou Enlai, head of the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China who came to our country for a friendly visit at the beginning of 1958, said: "The Chinese people, who have always been loyal to their internationalist obligations, will continue to fight side by side with the Korean people to defend the common interests of the two peoples in the future, as they have done in the past, as long as it is necessary." Our people are also full of solid determination and are always ready to join hands with the Chinese people to launch a heroic struggle in order to eliminate the common enemy.
    All the glorious achievements made by the peoples of Korea and China in the struggle for peace and socialism are inseparable from the continuous assistance of the great Soviet Union and the unity and close cooperation of the people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. The further strengthening of the militant friendship between the peoples of Korea and China makes a great contribution to further strengthening the unbreakable unity and power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The unity and power of the socialist camp is rapidly strengthening and developing, and the day of the final victory of peace and socialism on earth is approaching.
    The Korean people, who defend the outpost of peace and socialism in the East, will raise the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism higher and continue to launch a tenacious struggle for our common great cause.

    朝中两国人民的战斗友谊
    庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年
    金日成
    朝鲜人民同六亿五千万兄弟的中国人民以及全世界进步人民一道，以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接中华人民共和国建国十周年。
    中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，是中国历史上的根本变革，是伟大十月革命后显示马克思列宁主义战无不胜的生命力的最大的国际事件。从这时起，长期受外国帝国主义和国内反动势力的剥削和压迫的中国人民，在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在历史上破天荒第一次紧紧掌握了政权，踏上了创造社会主义新生活的道路。
    约占世界人口四分之一的中国人民摆脱帝国主义的羁绊，踏上社会主义的道路，给予世界帝国主义势力以沉重的打击，大大地加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力。
    中国革命的胜利，冲断了帝国主义殖民体系中最大的环节，大大地推动了全世界被压迫人民的解放斗争。
    美帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石匪帮在中国大陆上的惨败使亚洲的局势从根本上转变为对和平和社会主义有利。中华人民共和国成为亚洲人民解放斗争的坚强堡垒，从此为亚洲人民开辟了更加有力的登上国际舞台的新的广阔的道路。
    中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，给予为祖国的自由独立和社会主义而斗争的朝鲜人民以巨大的力量，使得他们更加坚定了胜利信心。
    我国有伟大的苏联和强大的社会主义中国为邻，这是我国人民取得胜利的可靠的保证。
    今天，朝中两国人民是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的亲密的兄弟，我们两国紧紧团结在一起，为和平和社会主义的共同的伟大事业而协力奋斗。
    朝中两国人民的友谊团结具有悠久的历史并且是通过艰苦的斗争而得到加强和发展。
    朝中两国人民在悠久的历史年月中结成了亲密的友谊，在反对外国侵略者的共同斗争中，曾互相给以帮助，特别是在反对凶恶的日本帝国主义侵略和掠夺的共同斗争中，朝中两国人民的战斗友谊得到了进一步的加强。
    日本帝国主义在强占了朝鲜，残酷地压迫和掠夺了朝鲜人民的同时，把朝鲜半岛变成为侵略大陆的桥头堡，把侵略矛头直接指向中国大陆。
    进入二十世纪三十年代，日本帝国主义把侵略的魔掌进一步伸展到中国大陆，更加加强了掠夺和压迫。于是，朝中两国人民更加紧密地展开了反对日本帝国主义的共同斗争，并把斗争发展到更高的阶段。
    朝鲜的共产主义者们和中国的同志们一起组织了抗日联军，以我国北部国境地带和中国东北地区为中心，广泛地展开了抗日武装斗争，在这个斗争过程中，朝鲜的游击队受到了中国人民的热烈支持和援助，并和他们同甘苦共患难。
    朝中两国人民在反对侵略者及其走狗的斗争中，深刻地体会到两国人民的命运是紧密相连不可分割的。
    朝中两国人民反对日本帝国主义的斗争，是两国以工人阶级为首的被压迫的劳苦大众在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的红色旗帜下进行的。我国的爱国者们经常从国际工人运动的中心、伟大的堡垒——苏联的繁荣富强中吸取到无限的力量和勇气，在任何艰苦的环境中也确信马克思列宁主义必定胜利，而帝国主义必定灭亡。朝中两国人民的这种共同斗争一直继续到由于伟大苏联军队的决定性的作用，促使日本帝国主义灭亡的1945年。在这悠久的历史时期内，形成了朝中两国人民的国际主义团结和合作的光荣传统。
    朝鲜人民依靠苏联军队从日本帝国主义殖民地统治下获得解放以后，接着，中国革命也取得了胜利，因而朝中两国人民的友谊团结发展到新的更高的阶段。两国人民的传统友谊得到了全面的发展。
    朝中两国人民友谊团结的伟大的生命力，在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚匪帮武装侵犯的祖国解放战争中，得到了光辉的发挥。
    兄弟的中国人民和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家人民一道，对美帝国主义反对朝鲜人民的武装侵犯给予坚决谴责并积极支持朝鲜人民的斗争并且表明了和朝鲜人民的牢不可破的国际主义友谊关系。
    特别是，在我国人民最艰苦的时期，中国人民高举抗美援朝的旗帜，向朝鲜前线派遣了由自己的优秀儿女所组成的志愿军。
    中华人民共和国这时适当建国初期，具有许多困难；但是与我国人民骨肉相连的兄弟的中国人民，怀着和朝鲜人民同甘共苦的坚定不移的决心，为了消灭共同的敌人，一致动员起来了。中国人民志愿军的参战，无限地鼓舞了我国人民和我国的人民军，并从根本上扭转了朝鲜的战局，使之有利于我们。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，给予深入到我国北半部的敌人以歼灭性的打击，并把它们驱逐出整个共和国北半部地区。美帝国主义在朝中两国人民团结的威力面前，接连遭到惨败，终于不得不向朝中两国人民低下头，在停战协定上签字。
    历时三年多的朝鲜战争，是历史上最激烈、最残酷的战争之一。在这残酷的战争中，中国人民志愿军所发挥的无比的革命英雄主义精神和朝中两国人民之间结成的巩固团结，是无产阶级国际主义精神活生生的典范。
    中国共产党和毛泽东同志曾指示：中国人民志愿军要像爱护自己的国家、自己的党和自己的人民一样，爱护朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民；要珍惜朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木。中国人民优秀的儿女——志愿军勇士们，忠实地执行了自己的党和领袖的这一指示，在任何艰难的环境下都保持了国际主义战士的荣誉。
    参加朝鲜战争的中国人民志愿军，以保卫自己祖国每一寸土地的那种精神和朝鲜人民军一起，以鲜血保卫了朝鲜的每一个高地和每一个村庄，并在与敌人的斗争中，发挥了无比的英雄精神和集体英雄主义精神。黄继光英雄留下遗言：“敌人的枪弹可能夺取我的生命，但绝不能夺取可爱的朝鲜弟兄的生命”，他以自己的胸膛堵塞敌人的枪口，保证了我军的胜利。这是最足以说明中国人民志愿军勇士们所发挥的彻底基于无产阶级国际主义精神的革命英雄主义精神的最生动的事例。全体志愿军勇士们就都以这种精神，为了朝鲜人民的胜利，在战斗中献出了自己一切最宝贵的东西。
    中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战争后，在两年零九个月的激烈的战斗过程中涌现出了许多战斗英雄和集体功臣单位。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为表彰他们卓越的功勋，授予黄继光、杨根思等许多同志以共和国英雄称号，对许多志愿军勇士们授予了勋章和奖章。
    中国人民志愿军官兵们是崇高的道德品质的优秀的体现者。他们在战斗艰苦的环境中，同我国农民一起翻耕土地进行播种和收割。当美帝国主义者进行野蛮轰炸的时候，他们冒着生命危险，抢救了我国许多人民的生命和财产；他们并节约自己的军粮，救济我国许多战争灾民。中国人民志愿军官兵和我国人民之间结成了深情厚谊和舍己互助的美好关系。
    中国人民志愿军罗盛教烈士，在寒风刺骨的冬天，勇敢地跳进冰窟窿，为了抢救朝鲜少年的生命不惜献出自己宝贵的青春。朝鲜农民朴在根为了保护志愿军伤员，以自己的身躯挡住敌人的枪弹因而壮烈牺牲。在朝鲜战争过程中所发生的这类事例，是举不胜举。
    全体中国人民积极参加抗美援朝运动，从物资并从精神上援助了战斗中的朝鲜人民。中国人民每年支援朝鲜人民巨大数量的粮食和其他救济物资，并像抚育自己的亲生的儿女一样，养育了我国两万多名战灾孤儿。
    三年激烈的朝鲜战争的结果，是朝中两国人民取得了胜利。
    中国人民以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民正义的争取自由和独立的解放斗争，在保证朝鲜人民的历史性的胜利中建立了不朽的功勋，并对恢复朝鲜的和平，保卫东方的和平事业，作出了巨大的贡献。
    中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军和全体朝鲜人民一起，击溃了国际反动的魁手——美帝国主义及其仆从国家的武装侵略，彻底揭穿了所谓“美帝国主义强大”的神话。这不仅是朝中两国人民伟大的胜利，同时也是全世界被压迫人民和爱好和平人民的历史性的胜利。
    朝中两国人民在朝鲜战争中获得了胜利，从而粉碎了美帝国主义企图挑起新的世界战争的侵略阴谋，并给他们的“实力政策”以致命的打击，无限地鼓舞了东方人民的民族解放斗争和全世界人民保卫和平的斗争。
    在朝鲜战争中美帝国主义不仅在军事上遭到了惨败，而且在政治上和道德上也遭到了可耻的惨败。他们作为重要手段的非人道的野蛮暴行，是帝国主义世纪末的腐败和憎恨人类思想的具体表现，遭到了全世界人民的憎恨和诅咒。
    朝中两国人民在朝鲜战争中所取得的胜利向全世界显示社会主义制度的优越性，显示了团结在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义旗帜下的社会主义阵营战无不胜的威力。
    朝鲜战争显示了觉醒起来的社会主义的新的亚洲人民不屈的斗志和无穷无尽的革命力量，并明确地说明：侵略者如果想侵犯社会主义阵营国家的人民，那末，必定要在社会主义国家人民集体的反击下遭到惨败。这使全世界社会主义阵营各国人民更加坚定了胜利信心，并对进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的统一和团结作出了巨大的贡献。
    在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义武装侵略的战争中，兄弟般的中国人民所建立的丰功伟绩，将永远记载在进步人类的史册上。
    停战后，中国人民志愿军同我国人民军一起，继续坚强地捍卫我国的和平防线，并且竭尽一切努力，使停战导致巩固的和平。但是继续盘踞在南朝鲜的美帝国主义及其走狗，横暴地违反停战协定，频繁地制造挑衅行为，策划各种凶恶的阴谋企图破坏我国人民和平的社会主义建设。中国人民志愿军同我国人民一起，坚强地保卫了朝鲜人民的和平劳动，不让它遭到敌人的侵犯，并为粉碎敌人的挑衅策划，促进朝鲜的和平统一，进行了不懈的斗争。
    与此同时，他们还积极帮助朝鲜人民进行战后艰苦的恢复建设。志愿军勇士们排除一切困难和不惜任何牺牲，发挥了一切力量，帮助朝鲜人民消除痛苦和不幸，保证他们未来的幸福。为了促进我国社会主义新生活的建设，志愿军勇士像建设自己祖国的城乡一样，竭尽一切诚意帮助了朝鲜城市和乡村的建设。
    志愿军勇士们亲手建筑了我国许多住宅和公共建筑物，恢复和修建了平壤的大同桥和其他许多桥梁。他们还参加了在加速我国农村经济发展方面具有巨大意义的许多灌溉工程、水库和河川治理工程的建设，建立了巨大的劳动功勋。
    八年来，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民同生死共患难，建立不朽的功勋。他们根据1958年朝中两国政府的建议，决定撤离朝鲜。截至1958年10月底为止，朝鲜人民以难忘的感激之情欢送了返回自己祖国的最亲密的朋友——英雄的中国人民志愿军。
    凡是朝鲜人民不分男女老少都向兄弟的中国人民和志愿军官兵表示衷心、热烈的感激和尊敬并且永远铭记着志愿军勇士们所留下的光辉的、伟大的功勋。
    中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，对促进朝鲜的和平统一和缓和亚洲的紧张局势具有巨大的意义。
    中国人民志愿军的撤出朝鲜，是中国人民一贯为和平解决朝鲜问题而作出的有诚意的努力的表现。
    朝中两国人民在反对共同敌人的长期斗争中以鲜血结成的战斗友谊，今天在两国人民建设社会主义的斗争中，得到进一步的巩固和发展，并进一步发挥了巨大的生命力。
    兄弟的中国人民和苏联以及其他社会主义国家人民一起，一贯给予我国人民以莫大的经济和技术上的援助。
    由于战争，我国人民经济遭到严重破坏，在人民生活处于极端贫困的时期，即在进行战后恢复建设的最艰苦的时期，中国人民给予我国人民以八亿元人民币（现用货币）的无偿援助。
    中国人民的这一珍贵的援助，在从废墟上以新的面貌重建起来的我国城市和农村，在欣欣向荣的我国人民的一切生活中，已经开花结果。
    中华人民共和国今天仍然不断给予我国的社会主义建设以莫大的援助。这一援助对于促进我国的社会主义建设和进一步提高我国人民的生活，具有巨大的贡献。
    在社会主义建设中，朝中两国人民的互助合作，不断得到扩大和发展。
    在这方面，1953年11月朝中两国签订的关于经济及文化合作协定起着巨大的作用。根据这个协定，我们两国广泛交换社会主义建设所需的材料和原料，在发展科学技术方面互相密切合作，同时不断地扩大文化交流，以及进行社会主义建设经验的交流。
    战后五年来（1954—1958年），朝中两国的贸易额大约增长到十七倍。
    目前，我们两国人民正在鸭绿江协力建设一座现代化的大型水力发电站。中国人民还送给我国新义州纺织联合厂、惠山造纸厂等一系列的工厂建设所需的机械设备以及我国工业的发展所需的材料和原料。
    正如世界社会主义体系的发展历史所证明，各兄弟国家互相交流社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验，意义十分重大。朝鲜人民经常吸收苏联、中国及其他一些兄弟国家建设社会主义的丰富经验，并从中得到巨大的鼓舞。
    朝鲜和中国过去都是殖民地、半殖民地的国家，都继承了旧社会遗留下来的落后的经济和文化。我们两国的社会主义建设有许多共同性。
    我们两国经常互派经济使节团和文化代表团，并且通过两国党的机关报和各种新闻出版机关，相互向本国人民广泛介绍对方在社会主义建设中取得的一切成就，交流在社会主义建设中所积累的经验。
    这种经济及文化合作的发展，进一步加强了朝中两国人民的友好和团结，更加促进两国的共同繁荣。
    通过反对侵略的共同斗争和在社会主义建设中的紧密合作，我们两国党、两国政府和两国人民之间的相互了解、信任和爱戴，进一步加深了。我们两国人民把自己一切的胜利，当作两国人民的共同胜利而感到无限高兴，并且从中得到鼓舞。
    在最近几年内，中华人民共和国政府代表团的访问我国，和我国政府代表团的访问中国，清楚地显示出我们两国人民的牢不可破的友谊团结。
    朝中两国人民的友谊团结，是只有在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中，才能看得到的人民之间的新的关系，是产生在共同的社会制度、思想和斗争目的上的新的关系，是基于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的完全平等、互相尊重和兄弟合作的新的关系。
    这种友谊团结，同社会主义阵营的加强和发展以及我们两国社会主义建设的胜利进行一起，不断得到巩固，这是任何力量所不能摧毁的。朝鲜人民无限珍视同兄弟的中国人民的友谊团结，并且为这种友谊团结的进一步发展而竭尽一切努力。
    今天，我们两国人民加强同一切社会主义国家人民之间的合作，并加强我们两国之间的互相合作，在社会主义建设中一起掀起空前的大高潮。
    兄弟的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。中国各城市和农村胜利地进行了社会主义改造，同时，在社会主义建设的一切部门掀起了空前的大跃进。去年中国的工业生产差不多增长了70％，谷物和其它农产品取得了大丰收。
    中华人民共和国的政治经济的威力得到了空前的加强，中国人民的物质文化生活水平得到了进一步的提高。全体中国人民沿着中国共产党指出的社会主义建设的总路线，为了进一步加速社会主义建设进行技术革命和文化革命，发挥高度的劳动热情和政治热情。今天，中华人民共和国正在迅速地转变成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国。
    朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在战后短短的时间内，恢复了被破坏的人民经济，朝着社会主义的高峰满怀信心地前进着。在我国人民经济各部门，确立了唯一的社会主义生产关系，清除了人剥削人的制度。生产力飞快地发展，人民生活也得到了进一步的改善。
    战后五年来，我国的工业生产每年平均增长42％，今年上半年比去年同期增长了75％。我国已经提前二年半在今年6月底完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划。
    我国人民在社会主义建设中不断取得新的更大的成就。在不久的将来，我国将转变成为发达的社会主义工业国家。
    在朝中两国人民面前展开着一条辽阔的大道，那就是克服本国历史上遗留下来的落后性，胜利进行社会主义建设，同一切兄弟国家人民一起，朝着人类的理想——共产主义社会阔步前进的康庄大道。赫鲁晓夫同志关于社会主义国家有效地利用社会主义制度所具有的可能性，将大致同时过渡到共产主义社会的高级阶段的这一论断，鼓舞我们两国人民展开新的劳动斗争。
    朝鲜和中国的社会主义建设的大高潮，如实地证明：从被剥削和压迫中获得解放并成为自己命运的主人的人民，在建设新生活的斗争中一定能发挥无穷尽的创造性的威力。我们两国人民长期受到了外国侵略者和地主、资本家的残酷剥削和压迫，备受无法形容的痛苦，过了贫穷的生活，而现在为了使自己落后的国家走上先进国家的行列，为了迅速改变落后于人家的生活处境，无遗地发挥精力和才能。他们对自己正义的事业，充满着坚定的胜利信心。任何力量都不能摧毁人民群众的这种革命热情，任何力量都不能阻挡他们的前进。
    我们两国社会主义建设的胜利展开以及我们两国人民友谊团结的加强，形成为在亚洲最后驱逐帝国主义侵略势力，维护持久和平，保证社会主义胜利的一支巨大力量。
    美帝国主义不顾全体亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的一致抗议和谴责，继续强占我国南半部，残暴地掠夺和压迫南朝鲜人民，并且把南朝鲜变成为饥饿和贫穷的活地狱。美帝国主义往南朝鲜搬进原子武器、导弹等各种新式武器，并正在把南朝鲜转变为挑起新战争的军事基地。
    美帝国主义强占台湾，胆敢进行反对中国人民的侵略的挑衅行为，不断在台湾海峡制造紧张局势。
    朝中两国人民就和这个凶恶的、共同的敌人直接相对峙，展开着紧张的斗争。
    我们两国人民为了使敌人得到最后的惨败，为了争取亚洲人民的自由、独立、和平和社会主义的最后胜利，继续坚决展开反对共同敌人的斗争。
    1958年年初前来我国进行友好访问的中华人民共和国政府代表团团长周恩来总理曾经说：“始终忠于自己的国际主义义务的中国人民，今后只要有必要，还会同过去一样奋不顾身地同朝鲜人民一起为保卫两国人民的共同利益而战斗。”我国人民也充满着坚固的决心，为了消灭共同的敌人，随时都准备同中国人民携手展开英勇的斗争。
    朝中两国人民在争取和平和社会主义的斗争中所取得的一切光辉成就，是和伟大的苏联源源不断的援助和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的团结及紧密合作分不开的。朝中两国人民战斗友谊的进一步加强，对进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结及其威力有巨大的贡献。
    社会主义阵营的团结及其威力日益迅速的加强并发展，和平和社会主义在地球上最后胜利的日子日益逼近了。
    保卫和平和社会主义东方前哨的朝鲜人民，将更高地举起马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，为我们共同的伟大事业而继续展开顽强的斗争。
