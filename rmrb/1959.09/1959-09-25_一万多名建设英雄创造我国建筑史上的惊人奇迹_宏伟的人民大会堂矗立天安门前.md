Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: The solemn and magnificent Great Hall of the People, through the creative efforts of more than 14,000 builders, has been victoriously completed at an unprecedented high speed in just over ten months. China's highest organ of power, the National People's Congress, will discuss national affairs here, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress will also work here.

This Great Hall, built in the context of the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, is located on the west side of Tiananmen Square, standing alongside Tiananmen and the Museum of the Chinese Revolution and the Museum of Chinese History. Its outline is perfect, its form solemn, and it is the most magnificent building in Beijing today. The building area is 171,800 square meters (larger than the entire effective building area of the Forbidden City in Beijing), and the volume is 1,596,900 cubic meters, with the highest central point being 45 meters. The four sides of the building feature magnificent marble and bush-hammered stone pillars. The front courtyard has open lawns and flower beds, and among the rows of trees composed of pines, willows, maples, and willows, there are parking lots and shunting routes. Rows of magnolia-shaped lamp clusters surround it.

This building consists of three main parts: a great auditorium that can accommodate 10,000 people, a banquet hall with 5,000 seats, and the office building of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The structure of the building is very complex, with reinforced concrete columns that are two meters in diameter and more than 40 meters high, reinforced concrete beams that are nine meters high and 32 meters long, steel roof trusses with spans of more than 60 meters, and large steel beams weighing up to 141 tons. The amount of decoration work is very large, with more than 170,000 square meters of marble, granite, terrazzo, and bush-hammered stone alone.

This Great Hall has all kinds of modern equipment. More than 1,000 large and small engineering projects, such as sound, light, electricity, air conditioning, and water heating equipment, are installed in the ceiling, underground, and around the walls. The temperature and humidity of the main halls, conference rooms, and some offices can be adjusted at any time through electric remote control. The heat sources include high-pressure hot water, high-pressure steam, and gas. There are also broadcast television facsimile and film shooting equipment. The seats in the auditorium have small loudspeakers, and the representatives' seats have interpreter booths that can simultaneously translate twelve languages and amplifiers for impromptu speeches. The ventilation and lighting equipment is also very complete. The air ducts and ventilation pipes all run under the floor and between the ceiling walls. Lighting equipment is installed in the halls and conference rooms according to the characteristics of the interior decoration.

The drafting of the design plan for this large-scale, modernly equipped, and highly artistic building began in September of last year, and construction began at the end of October. The day after the design unit submitted the drawings, the workers began to excavate the foundation on a large scale. The geological conditions were not good, and there were remnants of old riverbeds from the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties underground. The builders fought the sludge day and night, and the labor efficiency increased day by day. In one month, 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork was excavated.

In the process of designing, preparing, and constructing simultaneously, the construction site headquarters turned passivity into initiative and divided the entire project into several stages for continuous progress. While the previous stage was under intense construction, preparations were made for the next stage. During the main structural engineering, the entire construction site carried out the tense work of pouring reinforced concrete. Braving the heavy snow, the workers stood on scaffolding 33 meters high and poured the reinforced concrete columns and beams at the entrance of the auditorium. In order to ensure the construction period and project quality, the workers voluntarily gave up their holidays during the Lunar New Year's Eve and Spring Festival and insisted on working at high altitudes. After the main reinforced concrete structure was basically completed, hoisting steel roof trusses and steel beams became the key to the entire project. At this time, hoisting workers from Fulaerji, Taiyuan, Baotou and other places rushed to Beijing and cooperated with the workers in Beijing. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee of the construction site, leaders at all levels came to the site in person, and the vast number of employees were in high spirits. They overcame numerous difficulties, and finally hoisted the heavy, large-span steel roof trusses and steel beams from the ground to the roof more than 40 meters high with excellent quality and the fastest speed. At this time, the decoration project was also carried out simultaneously. The construction unit implemented a three-dimensional cross-parallel assembly line operation method, making full use of space and time. In the Great Hall, multi-layer scaffolding was built from the ceiling to the ground, and eight layers of simultaneous operations were launched. The workers also adopted advanced technical measures such as suspended scaffolding, which greatly shortened the construction period of the decoration project and accelerated the progress of the entire project. When the entire project was nearing completion, the area around the building became a work area for thousands of troops and horses. The workers rushed to install pipelines and build courtyards day and night, and launched a large-scale greening project. In more than a month, the site was clean and tidy, and the solemn and magnificent Great Hall, dressed in new glory, stood in front of Tiananmen Square. Many people who once cared about or doubted whether this building could be completed before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China are now vying to talk about high speed and praise the Great Leap Forward in front of this Great Hall.

The unit responsible for building this project adhered to the principle of putting politics in command and launching a mass movement in the construction process. At the same time, it carried out meticulous organizational management work. The Party organization divided the battles according to the requirements of the project and according to different construction stages. Each battle was divided into several combat units according to different project items, processes, and locations. In each unit, the workers set deadlines, efficiency, quality, and material consumption quotas according to the overall construction deployment. Therefore, everyone had clear goals and was full of energy. The Party's general line of socialist construction is vividly reflected here.

This project was jointly undertaken by the Beijing First Construction Engineering Company and more than 30 construction and municipal construction units. In addition, construction workers from 18 provinces and cities participated in the construction work. They united as one, cooperated closely, and effectively guaranteed the victorious completion of the construction task. The Beijing Urban Planning Bureau Design Institute was responsible for the design of this project. Famous architectural experts and teachers and students from relevant schools across the country successively proposed 84 floor plans and 189 elevation drawings. After many comparisons and repeated studies and modifications, a plan was finally formulated. According to the principles of suitability, economy, and attention to aesthetics within possible conditions, the design paid attention to implementing the spirit of both boldly creating and absorbing the essence of Chinese and foreign ancient and modern architectural art. The designers also went deep into the site and worked closely with the staff of the construction unit to identify problems and modify them at any time, creating many convenient conditions for construction from the design perspective.

The people of the whole country gave great concern and support to this project. During the more than ten months of construction, 7,000 outstanding workers were sent from 18 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shanghai. Among them were rebar workers, concrete workers, sculptors, painters, stonemasons, and carpenters. These heroes who came from afar to support the project felt infinitely honored to participate in the construction of the Great Hall of the People. They fought against severe cold and heat on the construction site. During the most intense period of construction, they voluntarily gave up their New Year and Spring Festival holidays and dedicated their wisdom and energy to the Great Hall of the People, which the people of the whole country were looking forward to. The building materials and decoration equipment required by the Great Hall of the People were fully supplied by state-owned, local state-owned factories, handicraft production cooperatives, and people's communes in Beijing, as well as support from 23 provinces and cities. Among them are high-quality steel from Anshan Iron and Steel, copper doors, steel windows, and elevators from Shanghai, marble from Yunnan, Shandong, Guangdong, Hebei and other places, and brocade from Hangzhou. The wire sent by Tianjin was as long as from Beijing to Nanjing, and Nanjing transported more than 2,000 large light bulbs of more than 1,000 watts. More than 200 factory workers across the country rushed to make various decoration materials and equipment for the Great Hall of the People with great enthusiasm. When undertaking the engineering orders of the Great Hall of the People, many factories loudly put forward the slogan of "building the Great Hall of the 600 million people better and more beautiful," and paid great attention to the quality of products. When Angang manufactured more than 4,000 tons of steel for the Great Hall of the People project, the workers noted "Steel for the Great Hall of the People project" on each furnace of steel from steelmaking to steel rolling, and after rolling into steel, they were tested many times before leaving the factory. Workers from the Shenyang Bridge Factory and the Shenyang and Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factories repeatedly checked the quality of each steel material when manufacturing the steel structure of the Great Hall of the People. After each component was made, they made a detailed production registration form for easy checking of the product quality. The Shanghai Hongguang Copper and Iron Factory manufactured 32 large copper doors, each as tall as a one-story building, half a month ahead of schedule, and sent the secretary of the factory's Party branch and the chairman of the trade union with more than a dozen workers to Beijing to install the copper doors perfectly.

During the construction of the Great Hall of the People, 300,000 person-times of state organ cadres, military officers and soldiers, school teachers and students, and citizens took turns to participate in the labor. In the labor force, there were leaders and generals of some central ministries, as well as cadres of Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Yi, Uygur and other ethnic groups. They all scrambled to dedicate their efforts to the Great Hall of the 600 million people. Even if they were moving a brick or transporting a small cart of soil, they tried every means to ensure that it fully met the requirements of the project and ensured the quality of the project. Sometimes, when they found even a little problem, they immediately wrote reports or suggestions and sent them to the construction leadership department. Many government officials and school teachers and students also used their rest time during the intense labor to carry out various services for the workers, which were welcomed by the workers.

The solution of many major technical problems in the project was aided by Soviet experts.

Recently, relevant departments invited well-known experts in the national construction industry to form a completion acceptance committee to conduct comprehensive acceptance and professional acceptance of the project. The experts believed that the project quality was excellent.

The experience accumulated by the builders in the labor of this huge building has created favorable conditions for China to build larger-scale projects in the future. (Attached picture)

    一万多名建设英雄创造我国建筑史上的惊人奇迹
    宏伟的人民大会堂矗立天安门前
    在短短十个多月中飞速完成建筑面积十七万多平方米，超过故宫的全部有效建筑面积
    六亿人民的代表将在这里讨论国家大事，全国人大常委会将在这里办公会堂包括：万人大礼堂、五千人宴会厅、人大常委办公楼
    据新华社24日讯　庄严宏伟的人民大会堂，经过一万四千多名建设者的创造性的努力，以十个多月的空前高速度胜利建成。我国最高权力机关——全国人民代表大会将在这里讨论国家大事，全国人民代表大会常务委员会也将在这里办公。
    在我国工农业生产大跃进的形势下兴建的这座大会堂，位于天安门广场的西侧，同天安门和中国革命博物馆、中国历史博物馆相鼎立，轮廓完美，体型庄严，是北京目前最宏伟的一座建筑物。建筑面积达十七万一千八百平方米（比北京故宫的全部有效建筑面积还大），体积为一百五十九万六千九百立方米，中央最高部位为四十五米。建筑物的四面是大理石和剁斧石造成的壮丽的大门柱。门前庭院有开阔的草坪和花坛，在松、柳和枫、柳组成的行道树中间，有停车场和调车路线。成排玉兰花形的灯簇环在它的周围。
    这个建筑物是由能容纳万人的大礼堂、五千个座席的宴会厅和人大常委会办公楼三个主要部分组成。建筑的结构十分复杂，有直径二米、高四十多米的钢筋混凝土大柱子，高九米、长三十二米的钢筋混凝土大梁，跨度六十米多的钢屋架，重达一百四十一吨的大钢梁。装修工程的工作量很大，仅大理石、花岗石、水磨石、剁斧石等就有十七万多平方米。
    这个大会堂有各种现代化的设备。在顶篷、地下和四周墙壁安装的声、光、电、空气调节和水暖等设备，有一千多个大小工程项目。各大厅、会议室和一些办公室的温度和湿度，都可通过电动的遥远控制的办法随时加以调节。热源有高压热水、高压蒸气和煤气。还有广播电视传真和拍摄影片等设备。大礼堂内的座位都有扩音小喇叭，在代表席上有能同时翻译十二种语言的译意风和即席发言的扩音机。通风和照明设备也很完善。风道和通风管全部穿行在地板下和顶篷墙壁之间。大厅和会议室都按照室内装饰的特点安装照明设备。
    这个规模宏大、设备现代化和有高度艺术水平的建筑，去年9月开始草拟设计方案，10月底破土兴工。设计单位交出图纸第二天，工人们就大规模地开挖地基。地质情况不好，地下有残存的辽、金和元朝的旧河道。建设者夜以继日地和淤泥展开搏斗，劳动效率逐日提高，一个月的时间就挖出了三十万立方米的土方。
    在边设计、边准备、边施工过程中，工地指挥部化被动为主动，把整个工程分为若干阶段连续进行。在上一阶段紧张施工的同时，就做好下一阶段的准备工作。在进行主体结构工程的时候，整个工地展开了浇灌钢筋混凝土的紧张工作。工人们冒着满天纷飞的大雪，站在三十三米的高空脚手架上，浇灌大礼堂台口的钢筋混凝土大柱和大梁。工人们为了确保工期和工程质量，自动放弃了除夕和春节的假日，在高空坚持工作。主要钢筋混凝土的结构工程基本完成后，吊装钢屋架、钢梁就成为整个工程的关键。这时，富拉尔基、太原、包头等地的吊装工人纷纷赶到北京，和北京的工人通力协作。在工地党委的统一领导下，各级领导干部亲临现场，广大职工斗志昂扬。他们克服了重重困难，最后终于以优等的质量，最快的速度，把量重、跨度大的钢屋架、钢梁由平地吊到四十多米高的屋顶上。这时，装修工程也同时进行。施工单位实行立体交叉平行流水作业的方法，充分利用空间和时间，在大礼堂内，从顶篷到地面，搭成多层的脚手架，展开了八层同时作业。工人还采用悬空脚手架等先进技术措施，大大缩短了装修工程的工期，加快了整个工程的进度。在全部工程接近竣工时，建筑物四周又成为千军万马的作业区，工人们在这里日夜赶装管道，修建庭院，并且展开了大规模的绿化工作。一个多月间，场光地净，庄严宏伟的大会堂，披着崭新的光彩，屹立在天安门前。许多曾经关心或者怀疑这个建筑物能否在建国十周年前完工的人们，现在在这座大会堂前，争说高速度，争颂大跃进。
    负责修建这项工程的单位，在施工过程中，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。同时进行了周密细致的组织管理工作。党组织根据工程的要求，按不同的施工阶段划分战役。每个战役按照不同的工程项目、工序和部位，分成若干个战斗单元。在每个单元内，工人们根据总的施工部署，定工期，定效率，定质量，定材料消耗额，因此，人人目标明确，干劲冲天。党的社会主义建设总路线，在这里得到了生动的体现。
    这项工程是由北京市第一建筑工程公司和三十多个建筑市政施工单位协作负责施工的，另有十八个省市的建筑工人参加了建设工作。他们团结一致，密切协作，有力地保证了建设任务的胜利完成。北京市城市规划管理局设计院担负了这项工程的设计。全国各地著名的建筑专家和有关学校的师生，先后提出八十四个平面方案和一百八十九份立面图纸，经过多方比较和反复研究修改，最后制定出一个方案。根据适用、经济和在可能条件内注意美观的原则，在设计中，注意贯彻了既要大胆创造，又要吸取中外古今建筑艺术上的精华的精神。设计人员并且深入现场，和施工单位的职工密切协作，发现问题，随时修改，从设计方面为施工创造了许多便利的条件。
    全国人民对这项工程曾给以极大的关切和支援。在施工的十个多月中，辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古、河北、山东、山西、甘肃、陕西、湖北、河南、湖南、江西、四川、广西、广东、江苏、上海十八个省、市、自治区派来了七千多名优秀的工人。其中有钢筋工、混凝土工、雕刻工、油漆工、石工和木工。这些远道而来支援的英雄们，都感到参加人民大会堂的建设无限光荣。他们在工地上与严寒、酷热作斗争。在施工最紧张的时候，他们自动放弃了新年和春节的假日，为这个全国人民所盼望的人民大会堂献出了自己的智慧和精力。人民大会堂所需的建筑材料和装饰设备，除北京的国营、地方国营工厂、手工业生产合作社和人民公社全力供给外，还有二十三个省市的支援。其中有鞍钢的优质钢材，上海的铜门、钢窗、电梯，云南、山东、广东、河北等地的大理石，杭州的锦缎。天津送来的电线有北京到南京这样长，南京运来了两千多只一千瓦以上的大灯泡。全国各地有二百多个工厂的职工，满怀热情地为人民大会堂赶制各种装修材料和设备，许多工厂在承制人民大会堂工程订货时，都响亮地提出了“把六亿人民的大会堂建设得更好更美”的口号，十分注意产品的质量。鞍钢为人民大会堂工程制造四千多吨钢材时，工人们从炼钢到轧钢材，都在每炉钢上注明“人民大会堂工程钢”，并在轧成钢材后经过多次化验才出厂。沈阳桥梁工厂以及沈阳和唐山的机车车辆工厂工人在制造人民大会堂的钢结构时，反复检查每块钢材的质量，每个部件制成后又作出详细的生产登记单，以便查对产品的质量。上海红光铜铁工厂把三十二扇一层楼高的大铜门，按计划提前半个月制造出来，并派工厂党支部书记和工会主席带着十多个工人把铜门送到北京，完善地安装妥当。
    在人民大会堂的建设中，国家机关干部、部队官兵、学校师生和市民群众有三十万人次轮流参加了劳动。在劳动队伍中，有中央一些部的领导人和将军，也有藏、蒙古、回、彝、维吾尔等民族干部。他们都争先恐后为这座六亿人民的大会堂献出自己的一份力量。他们尽管是搬一块砖或运一小车土，都千方百计想尽办法，做到完全合乎工程的要求，确保工程质量。有时，发现一点一滴的问题，都立即写出报告或建议书，送给施工领导部门。许多机关干部和学校师生，在紧张劳动中，还利用休息的时间，为工人开展了多种多样的服务工作，受到工人的欢迎。
    工程中许多重大技术问题的解决，曾得到苏联专家的帮助。
    最近，有关部门曾邀请全国建筑界著名专家，组成了竣工验收委员会，对这个工程分别进行综合验收和专业验收。专家们认为工程质量优良。
    工程的建设者在这个巨大建筑的劳动中所积累的经验，给我国今后建筑更大规模的工程创造了有利条件。（附图片）
