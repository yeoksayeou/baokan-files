Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, September 12th: The Soviet Union's, and the world's, first atomic icebreaker, the "Lenin," left the shipyard at 12:30 PM Moscow time on the 12th, and sailed along the Neva River into the center of Leningrad. It will begin its first voyage in two days. This is another great victory for the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

After leaving the shipyard, the "Lenin" will be docked in the Neva River for two days. The place where it is docked is almost exactly where the famous cruiser "Aurora" shelled the Winter Palace on the Neva River nearly forty-two years ago, opening up a new era of proletarian revolution.

The "Lenin" icebreaker is the largest icebreaker in the world, with a length of 134 meters and a width of about 28 meters. If gasoline were used as fuel, it would need 200 tons of gasoline per day and night. The power of this icebreaker is twice that of the latest American "Glacier" icebreaker. The "Lenin" has 44,000 horsepower, a displacement of 16,000 tons, and a speed of 18 knots per hour. It can make continuous voyages of more than one year without calling at ports. It does not need to add fuel and can travel a distance equivalent to three times around the earth in one go.

This huge icebreaker consumes only 45 grams (about one and a half taels) of nuclear "fuel" per day, and this fuel can be packed into a matchbox.

More than 500 enterprises in more than 50 economic regions of the Soviet Union provided various materials and equipment needed for the construction of this icebreaker.

    苏联和平利用原子能又一伟大胜利
    “列宁号”原子破冰船即将开航
　　新华社列宁格勒12日电　苏联的世界上第一艘原　子能破冰船“列宁号”，已经在12日莫斯科时间十二时三十分开离造船厂，沿涅瓦河开进列宁格勒市中心区。两天以后，它即将开始第一次航行。这是苏联在和平利用原子能方面的又一个伟大胜利。
    “列宁号”离开造船厂后，将在涅瓦河中停泊两天。它停泊的地方正是差不多四十二年前著名的“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰在涅瓦河上炮轰冬宫、从而开辟了无产阶级革命的新纪元的地方。
    “列宁号”破冰船是世界上最大的破冰船，全船长一百三十四米，宽约二十八米。如果改用汽油作燃料，那末，它每昼夜就将需要二百吨汽油。这艘破冰船的功率比美国最新的“冰河号”破冰船大一倍。“列宁号”具有四万四千匹马力，排水量达一万六千吨，每小时行驶十八浬，可以作不靠港的连续航行达一年以上。它不需要添加燃料，一口气就能航行相当于绕地球三圈的距离。
    这艘庞大的破冰船每天只消耗四十五克（约一两半）的核子“燃料”，这些燃料可以装进一个火柴盒子里去。
    苏联五十多个经济区的五百多个企业为这艘破冰船提供了建造中所需要的各种材料和设备。
