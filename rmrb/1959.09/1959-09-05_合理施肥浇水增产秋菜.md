Rational Fertilization and Watering to Increase Autumn Vegetable Production
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Vegetable Research Institute

There are many kinds of autumn vegetables, the main ones being Chinese cabbage, radish, carrot, kohlrabi, mustard greens, cabbage, and turnip. These vegetables are suitable for growing in cool seasons, and they are all transportable, storable, suitable for folk pickling and processing, and have long supply periods. Therefore, the level of output and the quality of these vegetables are closely related to the daily lives of the broad masses of people.

Currently, autumn vegetables have been sown in most areas. In order to improve quality and strive for a bumper harvest, it is necessary to seize the opportunity and strengthen field management; this is especially important for areas that have suffered from drought and flood disasters and have rushed to plant autumn vegetables under abnormal conditions.

Rational fertilization and timely watering are the central links in increasing the production of autumn vegetables and improving their quality. Generally, the growth period of autumn vegetables is about seventy to more than one hundred days. The seedling stage grows slowly and requires less fertilizer and water; only when the edible organs such as heads (such as Chinese cabbage and cabbage) or fleshy roots (such as radish, carrot, and kohlrabi) expand rapidly does the need for fertilizer and water increase significantly. In response to this growth habit and climate characteristics, it is necessary to seize the two months of September and October, which are suitable for the growth and development of autumn vegetables, and adopt appropriate fertilization and watering measures in order to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables.

Various fertilizer sources can be used for cultivating autumn vegetables. The main fertilizers used in various regions are compost, stable manure, and human excrement, followed by a small amount of cake fertilizer and ammonium sulfate (fertilizer powder). Except for human excrement and ammonium sulfate, which are fast-acting fertilizers and suitable for top dressing, other fertilizers are suitable for use as base fertilizer. This is because after these fertilizers are applied, they must undergo a period of decay and decomposition under high soil temperature and appropriate moisture conditions before they can be absorbed and utilized by the root system of autumn vegetables. In drought- and flood-stricken areas, autumn vegetables that are planted (or transplanted) in a rush without applying base fertilizer should have these fertilizers applied in holes or ditches between rows or on one side before the seedlings are thinned (to avoid the heat generated by acid fermentation and decomposition from raising the soil temperature and being detrimental to seedling growth, Hebei and Shandong often apply it to the north side), so that it can be used when autumn vegetables need a large amount of fertilizer. In the Jiangnan area, autumn vegetables that have not yet been planted should be given sufficient base fertilizer before sowing or transplanting. For autumn vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and cabbage, which have a long growth period and require a large amount of fertilizer, each mu can be fertilized with 5,000 to 10,000 jin of compost (stable manure), or 200 to 300 jin of cake fertilizer. Radish and kohlrabi only need 4,000 to 5,000 jin of decomposed compost (stable manure). Autumn vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and cabbage first grow relatively fat leaves, and then rely on these leaves to produce nutrients to promote heading or root enlargement. Taking Chinese cabbage as an example, the outer leaves grown during the seedling stage have less water and a high content of carbon and potassium, while the heart leaves grown during the peak heading period have more water, and the content of carbon and potassium is only half of that of the seedling stage. Therefore, appropriate fertilization during the seedling stage is of great significance for obtaining a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables.

During the seedling stage of Chinese cabbage and cabbage, it is best to apply decomposed human excrement or ammonium sulfate every seven to ten days (avoid contaminating the leaves when applying, apply 200 to 300 jin of human excrement or 10 to 15 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu), which can make the seedlings grow strong and vigorous, and it is expected that they will grow into larger heads in the future. This experience should be particularly advocated for areas where soil fertility has been leached and lost due to excessive rainfall, resulting in slow and weak seedling growth. In arid areas with a lack of irrigation conditions, fertilizers should be applied to the ground earlier so that they can be absorbed and utilized by seedlings after rainfall. For autumn vegetables such as radish, carrot, and kohlrabi, which are eaten for their fleshy roots, if base fertilizer has not been applied or the soil fertility is poor, appropriate amounts of human excrement or ammonium sulfate should also be applied during the seedling stage to accelerate the growth and development of seedlings. Lay the foundation for future root enlargement.

When the heads, fleshy roots, or enlarged leaves (such as mustard greens) of various autumn vegetables are fully developed, a larger amount of fast-acting fertilizer should be applied to meet their growth and development needs. For Chinese cabbage, cabbage, etc., from the beginning of heading to the peak heading period, human excrement or ammonium sulfate should be used as top dressing two to four times, and the amount can be increased by one or two times compared to the seedling stage. Radish, carrot, kohlrabi, turnip, and mustard greens only need to be applied with human excrement or ammonium sulfate once or twice. When applying top dressing to root vegetables, an appropriate amount of fertilizers containing more phosphorus and potassium components such as kang soil and wood ash can be added to improve the quality of these vegetables and enhance their resistance to diseases and insects. Generally, top dressing should be stopped fifteen to twenty days before the harvest of autumn vegetables.

Combined with top dressing, timely and appropriate watering should be carried out to give full play to the effectiveness of the fertilizer, and at the same time, meet the needs of autumn vegetables for water. During the seedling stage of autumn vegetables, the amount of watering should be small, focusing on protecting the seedlings. During the vigorous growth period, water cannot be lacking, and watering should continue when the surface soil turns white (dry). In drought-stricken areas with water shortage, methods such as planting by seizing soil moisture, spot watering, or rain-fed transplanting of seedlings should be adopted to plant autumn vegetables in a timely manner, and cultivation measures such as low ridges that easily accommodate rainwater and multiple hoeing (hoeing after rain, hoeing after watering), weeding, and soil cultivation to preserve soil moisture should be combined to enable autumn vegetables to obtain higher yields under appropriate fertilizer and water conditions. In rain-prone areas, attention should be paid to planting autumn vegetables on high ridges or high furrows. After rain during the seedling stage, shallow hoeing should be carried out in a timely manner to strengthen the evaporation of surface soil moisture and increase the air content of the soil, so that the root system of the seedlings can accelerate growth and strengthen, thereby promoting the growth and development of the above-ground parts. In rain-prone areas, drainage and irrigation systems should also be improved to ensure that there can be drainage in case of rain and watering in case of water shortage, so as to ensure the normal growth and development of autumn vegetables from the perspective of water, a high-yield factor.

Currently, cabbage, kohlrabi, etc., which are widely cultivated in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, are in the peak period of head or stem enlargement, and Chinese cabbage and radish are about to enter the vigorous growth period. It is a good time to focus on fertilizer and water. These areas must adopt appropriate fertilization and watering measures according to the conditions of various autumn vegetables and fertilizer and water sources, in order to obtain a bumper harvest in October. As for the autumn vegetables planted in Northwest China, North China, and Jiangnan, they are currently in the seedling stage. Preparations for fertilizer and water should be made so as to fertilize and water in a timely manner according to the growth and development of various autumn vegetables, and strive for a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables this year.

    合理施肥浇水增产秋菜
    中国农业科学研究院蔬菜研究所
    秋菜的种类很多，主要的有大白菜、萝卜、胡萝卜、根芥菜、雪里红、甘兰、芜菁等几种。这些蔬菜适于在冷凉的季节里生长，都具有耐运输、耐贮藏，适于民间腌渍加工、供应期长等特点。所以这类蔬菜产量的高低与品质的优劣，与广大人民日常生活息息相关。
    目前，大部分地区的秋菜均已播种，为提高品质、争取丰收，必需抓紧时机，加强田间的栽培管理工作；对于那些遭受旱涝灾害，在不正常的条件下抢种秋菜的地区，尤其重要。
    合理施肥与适时浇水，是增产秋菜、改进品质的中心环节。一般秋菜的生长期约为七十天到百多天。苗期生长较慢，需肥水较少；只有当叶球（如大白菜、甘兰）或肉质根（如萝卜、胡萝卜、根芥菜）等食用器官迅速膨大时，所需肥水量才显著增多。针对这一生长习性与气候的特点，必须抓紧9、10两个适于秋菜生长发育的月份，采用适当的施肥、浇水措施，以争取秋菜丰收。
    栽培秋菜可以利用各种肥源。各地采用的主要肥料有堆肥、厩肥、人粪尿等，其次还有少量饼肥和硫酸铵（肥田粉）。除人粪尿和硫酸铵是速效性肥料，宜于作追肥外；其他肥料均宜作基肥施用。因这类肥料施用以后，必须在较高的土温和适当的水分条件下，经过一段时间的腐烂分解，才能被秋菜的根群吸收利用。在旱、涝地区因抢时、抢播（或抢栽）不及施用基肥的秋菜，应在幼苗定棵以前，将这类肥料穴施或沟施于行间或一侧（为避免因酸酵腐烂所产生的热量提高土温对幼苗生长不利，河北山东一带多施于北侧），以供秋菜大量需肥时利用。在江南地区还没有种植的秋菜，应施足基肥再播种或栽苗。对于大白菜、甘兰等生长期长、需肥量大的秋菜，每亩基肥可施用堆肥（厩肥）五千到一万斤，或饼肥二、三百斤。而萝卜、根芥菜等有四、五千斤腐熟堆肥（厩肥）即可。像大白菜和甘兰等秋菜均是首先长成较肥壮的叶片，而后依靠这些叶片制造养分，来促进结球或根部的肥大。以大白菜为例，其苗期所生长的外叶水分少，含碳、钾量高，结球盛期所生长的心叶水分较多，含碳、钾量只有苗期的一半，所以苗期适量施肥，对获取秋菜丰收有较大意义。
    在大白菜和甘兰的苗期，最好每隔七到十天施用一次腐熟人粪尿或硫酸铵（施用时不要沾染叶片，每亩施用人粪尿二、三百斤或硫酸铵十到十五斤），可以使幼苗生长健壮，将来可望长成较大的叶球。这一经验，对于因雨水过多土壤肥力遭到淋洗流失，以致幼苗生长缓慢、瘦弱的地区，特别应当提倡。在缺乏灌溉条件的干旱地区，肥料应较早施用到地里，以便在下雨后就可以被幼苗吸收利用。对于萝卜、胡萝卜、根芥菜等食用肉质根的秋菜，在没有施用基肥或土壤肥力较差的情况下，也应在苗期施用适量的人粪尿或硫酸铵，以加速幼苗的生长发育。为将来膨大根部打下基础。
    当各种秋菜的叶球、肉质根或肥大的叶片（如雪里红）充分发育壮大时，应施用较大量的速效肥料，才能满足它们生长发育的需要。像大白菜、甘兰等，从开始结球到结球盛期，应以人粪尿或硫酸铵为追肥施用二到四次，用量可较苗期增灌一、二倍。萝卜、胡萝卜、根芥菜、芜菁和雪里红等，只需施用一、二次人粪尿或硫酸铵。对根菜类施用追肥时，可适量增加炕土、草木灰等含磷、钾成分较多的肥料，以增进这类蔬菜的品质和提高它们的抗病虫能力。一般追肥应在秋菜收获前十五到二十天停止施用。
    结合追肥应适时、适量浇水，才能充分发挥肥料的功效，同时也可以满足秋菜对于水分的需要。秋菜苗期，浇水量宜小，以保苗为主。在生长旺盛时期，不能缺水，表土发白（干燥）时即需继续浇水。在干旱地区缺水的条件下，应采用抢墒种、点浇种或育苗等雨移栽等方法，及时种植秋菜，并应结合采用易于容纳雨水的低畦和多锄（雨后锄，浇水后锄）、除草、培土等保存土壤水分的栽培措施，使秋菜能在适量的肥水条件下获得较高的产量。在雨涝地区，应注意采用高垅或高畦种植秋菜。苗期雨后应及时进行浅锄，以加强表土水分的散发，增加土壤的空气含量，使幼苗的根群加速生长壮大，从而促进地上部的生长发育。在雨涝地区并应做好排灌系统，做到有雨可以排，缺水可以浇，以便从水分这一丰产因素上来保证秋菜的正常生长与发育。
    目前东北、内蒙古一带栽培较多的甘兰、球茎甘兰等正是叶球或球茎膨大盛期，大白菜、萝卜等即将进入生长旺期，正是应该大抓肥水的好时候，这些地区必须针对各种秋菜和肥源、水源等条件，适当的施肥和浇水，以期在10月里能够获得丰收。至于西北、华北及江南等地区种植的秋菜，目前，尚在幼苗时期，应作好肥、水的准备工作，以便按各种秋菜的生长发育及时施肥和浇水，力争今年秋菜大丰收。
