    Past and Present
    ——Interviews with Veteran Athletes Liu Changchun, Jiao Yulian, and Dai Linjing
    By our reporter You Qi
    (I)
    In the office of the newly built Beijing Workers' Stadium, I found Liu Changchun, a famous sprinter from our past, who has been appointed as a member of the Athletics Competition Committee for this National Games.
    Liu Changchun lives on the second floor of this newly completed, magnificent circular building. He recently came to Beijing from the Northeast. For the past few years, he has been teaching physical education courses at the Dalian Institute of Technology.
    He excitedly told me, "Since arriving in Beijing, I have seen the vigorous development of national sports, the continuous emergence of new records, and the large-scale construction of stadiums and swimming pools. I have many thoughts, but in one sentence: This generation of Chinese youth is so happy." He said, "Chairman Mao and other national leaders often meet with outstanding athletes to encourage them to train well and improve their skills. I feel that the Party and the government's care for sports is the source of the vigorous development of our country's sports."
    Speaking of this, Liu Changchun said with great emotion, "When we were young, it wasn't like this at all. If you ran well, no one cared; if you ran badly, no one cared even less. As for basic scientific training, that was out of the question. At that time, athletes had to follow the old Chinese method, 'work hard' and train on their own. Self-training is necessary, but without guidance, incorrect movements and postures cannot be corrected. Long-term habits are formed, and it becomes difficult to progress further once the performance reaches a certain level. My 'sprint' power was very good, but my reaction was not fast, and my starting foot was slow, so I often lagged behind in the first thirty or forty meters of the 100 meters. The result was always around 10.7 seconds. Now, young athletes have good coaches to help them and good facilities and equipment for them to practice in their spare time from work and study. Under such good conditions, coupled with their diligence and hard work, even better results will surely appear at this National Games."
    "My 10.7-second record in the 100 meters was maintained for twenty years in the old society, but I am not happy about it." Liu Changchun continued, "A common record maintained for twenty years can only illustrate the weakness of old China and the corruption and incompetence of the ruling class."
    Speaking of this, Liu Changchun told the following story with great sorrow:
    In the winter of 1935, the Kuomintang government, in preparation for participating in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, gathered athletes at Tsinghua University for training. The person in charge of the training did not understand the essentials of training, and the training plan was unreasonable. That winter was particularly cold, with water freezing into ice in the morning, but the training plan stipulated that Liu Changchun had to do 30-meter "sprints" outdoors from the beginning. One morning, the whistling north wind made people shiver, and Liu Changchun went outside with all his muscles contracted into a ball, but relying on his youth and good health, he still practiced according to the plan. As a result, due to the cold, the contracted and tense thigh muscle tissue ruptured. Afterwards, he never regained his original level. Later, when he competed in Berlin, he only ran 11 seconds in the 100 meters and was eliminated in the first preliminary round.

    (II)
    After a recent rain, the air in the Beijing Workers' Stadium was particularly fresh. On the second floor, I met Jiao Yulian, a famous female sprinter from our past.
    Jiao Yulian is also a member of the Athletics Competition Committee appointed for this National Games. In the 1934 North China Games, she set a pre-war Chinese women's 100-meter record of 13.2 seconds. In recent years, she has been working in the Dalian City Sports Commission.
    "It's really great!" Jiao Yulian pointed to the entire stadium and repeatedly praised, "Such a good venue, such good conditions!"
    Then, with a very heavy heart, she recounted a story from the North China Games: "More than twenty years ago, I, a girl who was in the limelight on the sports field, was training and setting records with a feeling of disgust, fatigue, and confusion. Every time I walked into the sports field with my running shoes, I always felt that the shoes weighed more than ten or twenty pounds. At that time, I didn't know why I was running or for whom I was striving for honor.
    The most unpleasant thing happened at the 1934 North China Games. When Henan selected athletes, Jiao Yulian fell at the finish line of the 100-meter preliminary round. She slid several meters on the uneven cinder track, and the flesh on both knees was scraped raw, revealing the kneecaps. The next day in the final, Jiao Yulian could no longer run, but her school's physical education teacher told her: "For the glory of our school, you must strive to be a contestant. You must run in the final." "The glory of the school" was enough to disregard the serious injury of the athlete. When the knee injury had just healed, the North China Games opened. The leader of the Henan team insisted that she participate in four events: 50 meters, 100 meters, 200 meters, and long jump. It was such a heavy burden for a girl who usually didn't exercise much to participate in intense running and jumping competitions every day for four or five days. Therefore, after all the individual events were over, Jiao Yulian was exhausted, but the leader still insisted on calling her to participate in the 400-meter relay race.
    "In this way, although we won many trophies, my impression of the sports meeting was very bad. In such a situation, how could athletes have good results!"
    Jiao Yulian finally said, "The changes between the past and the present are too great. Seeing everything now often makes people so excited that they can't sleep well. In the past, the life of Chinese girls on the sports field was very short. Most of them only appeared for three or two years, and then disappeared. Now that I see many of our outstanding female athletes improving year by year, some have been progressing continuously for five or six years, some have broken world records, and many have achieved results close to the international level, I am really happy for them. I hope that all our female athletes can strengthen their training under the care of the motherland and create more outstanding achievements."

    (III)
    At the Yongwai Hotel, a newly built hotel outside Yongdingmen – the office of the Football Competition Committee of the National Games – I interviewed Dai Linjing, a famous center forward who dominated the football field for more than ten years twenty years ago.
    Dai Linjing is from Jiaxing, Zhejiang, and has loved playing football since he was a child. Later, because he played well in several university football games, he joined the Shanghai Lehua football team. In the old society, everything was a commodity, and the Lehua team was also organized by capitalists. The boss and brokers controlled all the power of the team. Every year, once the Shanghai football season was over in the summer, the boss would organize the team to compete abroad. For three consecutive years, the Lehua team traveled to Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other places, and each time they played very well and earned considerable income. The boss made money, and in the first year, he said that he would find a venue and a practice field for the Lehua team. But three years passed, and there was no movement on the venue. Dai Linjing and seven or eight other athletes quit Lehua in a fit of anger and organized the Donghua team with another group of football enthusiasts. Although the internal management of the Donghua team was better, there were still bosses and brokers, and the status of the athletes was still just one kind of "living commodity" among thousands of commodities.
    Dai Linjing said with a wry smile, "In the old society, capitalists controlled the fate of football players. Whoever was best at playing tricks, whoever played the most fancy and beautiful, was the 'popular person' who attracted the audience. There was no real sport, let alone the all-round development of the athletes."
    "Not only that," Dai Linjing continued, "In the years when imperialism ran rampant in China, Chinese football players were also subjected to insults and oppression from imperialism. In the final of a Shanghai football league, the Donghua team competed with the West Patrol team for the championship. The referee was a foreigner who had a close relationship with the West Patrol team. He made things difficult for Donghua everywhere and used his whistle to disrupt many of Donghua's attacks, but even so, Donghua still led by two to zero in the first half. After the second half started, the referee's difficulties became even greater. Almost as soon as the ball reached the West Patrol team's defense zone, he would either blow 'offside' or call another foul. I was the captain on the field at the time and couldn't bear it any longer, so I made a suggestion to him, but he immediately expelled me from the field. After the game, the Football Association, which was controlled by Westerners, made a decision to penalize the Donghua team from participating in the football league for one year." Speaking of this, Dai Linjing sighed and said, "Under such a system, sports could not develop healthily at all. Therefore, when I saw the country's leap forward development after liberation and the Party's meticulous care for our young generation of athletes, my excitement and joy are indescribable."

    过去和现在
    ——老运动员刘长春、焦玉莲、戴麟经访问记
    本报记者　尤淇
    （一）
    在新建成的北京工人体育场的办公室里，我找到了我国过去有名的短跑健将刘长春，他是这次全国运动会聘请的田径竞赛委员会的委员。
    刘长春就住在这座新落成的巍峨的环形巨厦的第二层楼上。他是前不久才从东北来到北京的。这几年来，他一直在大连工学院担任体育课程。
    他兴奋地告诉我：“我到北京以后，看到国家体育运动这样蓬勃开展，新纪录不断涌现，体育场、游泳池的大量修建，我的感想很多，但用一句话来说就是：我国这一代青年真太幸福了。他说：“毛主席和其他国家领导人经常接见优秀运动员，鼓励运动员们练好身体，提高技术。我觉得，党和政府对体育的关怀，是我国体育运动蓬勃发展的力量的源泉。”
    说到这里，刘长春十分感慨地说：“我们年轻的时候完全不是这样的，跑好了，没有人过问，跑坏了，更没有人关心。至于科学的基本训练，就更谈不到了。那时候，运动员们只好按照中国的老法，‘下苦功’自练。自练是必要的，但是没有人指点，不正确的动作和姿势得不到纠正，长期养成了习惯，成绩到了一定高度就再难进展。我的‘冲刺’力很好，但是反应不快，起脚慢，因此百米的前三四十米经常落在后头，成绩始终在十秒七左右。现在的青年运动员在劳动和学习之余，有好的教练帮助他们，有好的场地和设备供他们练习。在这样好的条件下，再加上他们的勤学苦练，更好的成绩一定会在这次运动会上出现。”
    “我的百米十秒七的纪录在旧社会保持了二十年，但是，我并不高兴。”刘长春接着说：“一项普通的纪录保持了二十年，这只能说明旧中国的衰弱，统治阶级的腐败和无能。”
    谈到这里，刘长春十分沉痛地讲了下面的一个故事：
    1935年的冬天，国民党政府为了准备参加1936年在柏林举行的奥林匹克运动会，曾把选手集中在清华大学进行训练，负责训练的人并不懂得训练的要领，因而制订出的训练计划很不合理。那年冬天特别寒冷，早晨滴水成冰，但是训练计划中却规定刘长春要在室外作一开始就是三十米“冲刺”的练习。一天早晨，呼呼的北风吹得人发抖，刘长春走到外面全身肌肉都收缩成一团，但是他凭着年轻和身体好，仍旧按计划练习。结果，由于太冷，收缩紧绷的大腿肌肉组织破裂了。以后，他一直没有恢复原先的水平。后来到柏林比赛时，百米只跑了十一秒钟，在第一场预赛中就被淘汰了。
    （二）
    刚下过雨，北京工人体育场里的空气特别新鲜。在二楼我见到了我国过去女子短跑名手焦玉莲。
    焦玉莲也是这次全运会聘请的田径竞赛委员会的委员。她在1934年的华北运动会上，以十三秒二的成绩创造了战前中国女子百米赛跑的最高纪录。最近几年她一直在旅大市体委工作。
    “真好啊！”焦玉莲指着整个运动场，一再赞美说，“这样好的场地，这样好的条件！”
    接着，她以十分沉重的心情叙述了一段华北运动会时的往事：“二十多年前，我这个在运动场上出尽风头的女孩子，却是在厌恶、疲倦和茫然的心情下进行锻炼和创造纪录的。每次，当我提着跑鞋走进运动场的时候，总觉得那双鞋子有十几二十斤重，那时候我不知道我为什么而跑，为谁争取荣誉。
    最不愉快的事情发生在1934年的华北运动会上。当河南选拔选手的时候，焦玉莲在百米预赛的终点摔倒了，人在高低不平的煤渣地上哧蹓过去有好几米远，两个膝盖上的肉都被刮得稀烂，连膝盖骨都看得见了。第二天决赛，焦玉莲不能再跑了，但是她的学校的体育教员对她说：“为了我们学校的光荣，你必须争取当选手，决赛是非跑不可的。”好一个“学校的光荣”，就可以不顾运动员的重伤。当膝伤刚好，华北运动会就开幕了。河南省的领队非要她参加五十米、一百米、二百米、跳远四项竞赛不可。一个平常不大锻炼的女孩子，要在四五天时间内天天参加剧烈的跑跳角逐，这是多么重的负担。因此当所有个人的项目都结束以后，焦玉莲已是精疲力尽了，但是领队还非要叫她参加四百米的接力赛跑。
    “就这样，我们虽然得到了不少锦标，但是我对于运动会的印象，由此也就极坏。在那样的情景下，运动员怎么会有很好的成绩呢！”
    焦玉莲最后说：“过去和现在，变化是太大了，看到现在的一切，经常叫人激动得睡不好觉。过去，中国女孩子在运动场上的生命是非常短促的，大多数只出现三年两年，以后就消声匿迹了。当我现在看到不少我国优秀的女运动员一年比一年进步，有的五六年来一直前进不歇，个别的打破了世界纪录，不少人还创造出接近国际水平的成绩，我真为她们高兴。希望我们所有的女运动员们都能在祖国这样的关怀下加强锻炼，创造出更优异的成绩。”
    （三）
    在永定门外新建成的永外旅馆——全运会足球竞赛委员会办公的地方，我访问了二十年前曾经在足球场上称雄十多年的有名中锋戴麟经。
    戴麟经是浙江嘉兴人，从小就喜欢踢足球。后来由于在几次大学生足球赛里踢得好，加入了上海的乐华足球队。在旧社会，什么都是商品，乐华队也是由资本家组织的，老板和经纪人掌握了全队的大权。每年一到夏季，上海的足球季节一过，老板就组织全队到国外比赛。一连三年，乐华队远征了澳大利亚、印度尼西亚、马来亚等地，每次都踢得很好，收入很可观。老板赚了钱，第一年就说，要为乐华队找一个会址和一个练习的场地。但是三年过了，场地的事一点也不见动静。戴麟经和另外七八个运动员一气退出了乐华，与另一群足球爱好者组织了东华队。东华队的内部管理虽然好些，但是还是少不了老板和经纪人，运动员的地位，仍然只是千百万宗商品中的一种“有生命的商品”而已。
    戴麟经苦笑着说，“在旧社会，资本家掌握了足球运动员的命运，谁最会耍弄技术，谁踢得花巧好看，谁就是吸引观众的‘红人’，根本谈不上真实的运动，更谈不上运动员的全面发展。”
    “不仅如此”，戴麟经接着说：“在过去帝国主义逞凶中国的年代，中国的足球运动员还要受到帝国主义的侮辱和压迫。在一次上海足球联赛的决赛中，东华队与西捕队争夺冠军，裁判员是一个与西捕队关系很深的外国人，他处处与东华为难，用哨子破坏了东华队的多次进攻，但是即使这样，上半场东华队还是以二比零领先。下半场开始后，这位裁判的刁难就更加多了，差不多只要球一到西捕队的防区，不是吹‘越位’，就是判别的犯规。我当时是场上队长，实在气不过了，向他提了一点意见，他却立刻把我驱逐出场。赛后还由西人把持的足联会作出决定，判罚东华队一年内不得参加足球联赛。”说到这里，戴麟经叹了一口气说：“在那样的制度下，体育运动是根本不可能健康发展的。因此，当我看到解放以后国家的飞跃发展，看到党对我们年青一代运动员的无微不至的关怀，我的兴奋和愉快是难以形容的。”
