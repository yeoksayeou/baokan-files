    This newspaper reports: Feixi County, Anhui Province, has decided to expand its autumn planting area by nearly double, requiring next year's summer grain total output to increase by 1.48 times compared to this year.
    The Feixi County Party Committee recently held a special meeting of the Party Committee Secretaries of each commune to specifically discuss and arrange the autumn planting area, quality, and yield targets. The meeting first summarized the experience of this year's summer harvest. Everyone believed that the summer harvest was successful primarily due to the implementation of the production increase policy of "planting more high-yield crops and harvesting more," and secondly due to the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Through summarizing experiences, everyone unanimously agreed that continuing to implement the policy of "planting more high-yield crops and harvesting more" is the main guarantee for striving for a summer harvest next year. The Feixi County Party Committee believes that the current rural situation is very good, the People's Communes have become more sound and consolidated after rectification, the broad masses of cadres and people have gained experience in planting more and harvesting more, and in particular, the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people to continue to leap forward. At the same time, there are no major difficulties in terms of crop rotation, labor, and livestock arrangements. They arranged crop rotations based on the principle of early harvest and early planting, and late harvest and late planting. For example, wheat can be planted in paddy fields, summer corn fields, and single-season late rice fields; barley can be planted in sweet potato and bean fields; and rapeseed can be planted in early rice fields. At the same time, 200,000 mu of paddy fields can be used to plant green manure. In terms of labor arrangement, in addition to participating in county and commune processing industries and public welfare undertakings, there are still more than 285,500 laborers in the county. Before the Autumn Equinox, they will conduct autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and field management for late autumn crops; after the Autumn Equinox, they will concentrate a superior force of 200,000 people to carry out autumn planting. From the Autumn Equinox to the Frost's Descent, a total of 1.2 million mu can be sown, and it is no problem to complete the autumn planting task ahead of schedule.
    In terms of livestock arrangement, each ox can deeply plow about one mu per day. From the White Dew to the Cold Dew, a total of 1,125,000 mu can be plowed and harrowed, and the autumn plowing task can also be completed ahead of schedule. After analyzing these situations, the County Party Committee decided to expand the autumn planting area from 550,000 mu last year to 1,010,000 mu this year.
    In order to ensure the realization of the autumn planting plan, the specific measures proposed by the County Party Committee are: while harvesting autumn crops, appropriately arrange labor, livestock, and tools to deeply plow the land with gang plows, ensuring fine cultivation; apply more than 300 dan of base fertilizer per mu for general fields, and 700 to 1,000 dan of base fertilizer per mu for high-yield fields; require about 25 jin of seeds per mu, and fully implement north-south oriented strip sowing, with a sowing width of 3 inches and a row spacing of 4 inches, and dense planting of rapeseed at 4×6 inches, achieving both density and uniformity; comprehensively promote improved varieties such as "Nanda 2419" and "March Yellow" in order to arrange crop rotations in the future; according to the planting experience of "early White Dew, late Frost's Descent, Autumn Equinox and Cold Dew are the right time," it is required to concentrate superior forces to complete the autumn planting task from three or four days before the Autumn Equinox (September 24) to six or seven days after the Cold Dew (October 9).
    Currently, the autumn planting campaign in Feixi County, focusing on fertilizer accumulation and deep plowing, is developing vigorously. The county's army of over 50,000 fertilizer accumulators has accumulated more than 91 million dan of various fertilizers; more than 150,000 mu of land has been deeply plowed in recent days; and various tools for autumn planting have been repaired. At the same time, various places are actively rushing to manufacture tools such as strip sowing harrows and five-row roller seeders to support autumn planting work.
    This newspaper reports: The Wanglaojia Production Brigade of Guangwu Commune in Jieshou County, Anhui Province, has given full play to the superiority of the People's Commune. While striving for planting more and harvesting more, it has formulated a plan to cultivate a 10,000-mu high-yield wheat demonstration plot with 1,000 jin per mu. Now this brigade is actively carrying out various preparatory work around the high-yield plot plan and has achieved great results.
    In the first summer harvest after communization, the Wanglaojia Brigade obtained a large-area high yield of 472 jin per mu on average from 6,118 mu of wheat, an increase of more than double compared to last year. In order to do a good job in this year's autumn planting, the Party Branch of this brigade adopted a three-way combination of cadres, technicians, and the masses to summarize this year's high-yield experience. This experience mainly ensured that autumn-planted wheat was sown in a timely manner with adequate moisture, conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, deeply plowed the land to about one chi, applied about 100 dan of base fertilizer, and achieved reasonable close planting, plus meticulous field management after emergence, which greatly improved the level of cultivation compared to before communization. While summarizing the experience of wheat, it was also found that there were still some problems that needed to be further resolved. For example, more than 6,000 mu of wheat were not connected into large plots, and other crops were interspersed in the middle, which brought inconvenience to field management; water conservancy construction could not fully meet irrigation needs; fertilizers were not completely produced and used locally, thus more labor was spent in fertilizer transportation. Through summarizing this year's large-area high-yield experience of wheat, the confidence of the broad masses of cadres and people in striving for a large-area high yield of wheat next year has been further encouraged. The Party Branch of this brigade proposed a plan to develop a 10,000-mu high-yield plot this autumn. The plan not only requires the autumn planting area to be expanded by 66% compared to the same period last year, but also requires an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu in terms of unit area yield. Once this plan was proposed, it was unanimously supported by all commune members.
    In order to realize this year's wheat 1,000 jin high-yield plot plan, the Wanglaojia Brigade, based on the favorable conditions of the unified planning of land and the centralized and rational use of manpower within a larger scope after communization, decided not to interplant other crops in the middle of the wheat field, and merged them into a 10,000-mu wheat high-yield plot. At the same time, focusing on the plan to cultivate a high-yield wheat plot, it vigorously carried out basic construction work, and determined that the 10,000-mu wheat high-yield plot should be completely turned into garden fields before this year's autumn planting. To this end, it is planned to dig three large main canals, sixteen branch canals, and one thousand capillary canals; and it is planned to sink two thousand wells, requiring one well every five mu, to fully ensure the water needs of the wheat fields. In order to improve the quality of fertilizer, this brigade expanded forty-four local chemical fertilizer plants to ensure that each mu is applied with 300 dan of base fertilizer, including 30 jin of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer per mu, which is three times more than last year's fertilizer application. It is also necessary to accumulate fertilizer at the edge of the fields and implement one manure pool per ten mu to achieve timely fertilizer application and reduce the fertilizer transportation process.
    The Wanglaojia Brigade took the approach of grasping early, grasping quickly, and grasping well, and actively carried out various preparatory work for this year's autumn planting. As early as the basic completion of summer planting, 30% of the brigade's labor force was drawn out and put into autumn planting preparation work without affecting the management of autumn fields. From July to now, the autumn planting fertilizer accumulation team has accumulated 1.5 million dan of various farmyard manures, of which 1 million dan has been transported to the fields, and more than 150,000 jin of local chemical fertilizers have been produced; a water conservancy army of 1,000 people has been formed and has excavated more than 154,000 cubic meters of earthwork. In conjunction with the current drought resistance and seedling protection campaign, 1,400 wells have been sunk. The brigade also drew out 15,000 yuan from the funds accumulated in the first half of this year to purchase 200,000 jin of cake fertilizer and one 60-horsepower water pump for autumn-planted wheat; the entire brigade used night schools and production intervals to train 600 people, including experienced farmers, young people, Party members, League members, production team leaders, and group leaders, in seed drill operation, deep plowing and land preparation, and seed treatment. In terms of wheat seeds, 250,000 jin of "Nanda 2419" improved wheat seeds have been dried and tested for germination rate. In order to help the brigade solve the difficulty of insufficient labor, the Commune Party Committee transferred five tractors for代耕, and now all 4,200 mu of early autumn crops that have been harvested have been machine-tilled once, with a deep plowing of about one chi.
    On the basis of doing a good job in autumn planting preparation work in advance, the brigade plans to complete the timely planting of 10,000 mu of wheat within five days after the Cold Dew.

    秋种计划先进措施具体
    肥西冬麦面积扩大近一倍　界首光武公社搞万亩千斤丰产片
    本报讯　安徽省肥西县决定将秋种面积扩大近一倍，要求明年夏粮总产量比今年增长一点四八倍。
    中共肥西县委最近专门召开各公社党委书记会议，对秋种面积、质量和产量指标作了具体讨论和布置。会上首先总结了今年夏季大丰收的经验。大家认为，今年夏季所以获得丰收，首先由于贯彻了“多种高产多收”的增产方针，其次是全面地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。通过总结经验，大家一致认为继续贯彻“多种高产多收”的方针，是争取明年夏季丰收的主要保证。中共肥西县委认为，今年农村形势非常好，人民公社经过整顿已经更加健全和巩固，广大干部群众已取得多种多收的经验，特别是党的八届八中全会决议，大大启发了广大干部群众继续跃进的干劲。同时，在茬口、劳力、畜力安排上也没有多大困难。他们根据早收早种、迟收迟种的原则，安排了茬口。如小麦可种在中稻、夏玉米、单季晚稻等田里，大麦可种在山芋、豆类田里，油菜可种在早稻田里，同时还可利用二十万亩水田种绿肥。在人力安排方面，全县劳力除参加县社加工工业和公共福利事业外，尚有二十八万五千五百多人。秋分前，分别进行秋收、秋耕、积肥和晚秋后期田间管理；秋分以后，就集中优势兵力二十万人进行秋种。从秋分到霜降，共可播种一百二十万亩，提前完成秋种任务是没有问题的。
    在畜力安排上，每头牛每天可深耕约一亩，从白露到寒露，共可犁耙一百一十二万五千亩，秋耕任务也可以提前完成。县委分析了这些情况后，决定今年秋种面积由去年五十五万亩扩大到一百零一万亩。
    为了保证秋种计划的实现，县委提出的具体措施是：在秋收的同时，适当安排劳力、畜力、工具，用套犁深耕地，做到精耕细作；一般田每亩施基肥三百担以上，丰产田每亩施基肥七百到一千担；要求每亩下种二十五斤左右，并全面实行南北向阳条播，播幅三寸，行距四寸，油菜4×6寸密植，做到既密又匀；全面推广“南大二四一九”、“三月黄”等良种，以便今后安排茬口；根据“白露早，霜降迟，秋分寒露正当时”的播种经验，要求在秋分（9月24日）前三、四天到寒露（10月9日）后六、七天，集中优势兵力完成秋种任务。
    目前，肥西县各地以积肥、深耕为主的秋种运动正在蓬勃展开。全县五万多人的积肥大军，已积攒各种肥料九千一百多万担；连日已深耕土地十五万多亩；秋种的各种工具也都整修齐全，同时各地还正积极赶制条播耙、五行滚筒播种器等工具，支援秋种工作。
    本报讯　安徽界首县光武公社王老家生产大队，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，在争取多种多收的同时，制订了培养秋种小麦万亩千斤的丰产片计划。现在这个大队正围绕丰产片计划，积极进行各项准备工作，并已取得了很大成绩。
    王老家大队在公社化后的第一次夏收，六千一百一十八亩小麦即获得了平均亩产四百七十二斤的大面积丰产，比去年增产一倍以上。为了搞好今年秋种工作，这个大队党总支，采取了干部、技术员、群众三结合的办法，总结了今年的丰产经验。这些经验主要是保证了秋种小麦趁墒适时下种，认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，土地深耕一尺左右，施底肥一百担左右，做到了合理密植，再加上出苗后进行细致的田间管理，使耕作水平比公社化前有了很大的提高。在总结小麦经验时，也发现还有某些需要进一步解决的问题。如六千多亩小麦没有连成大片，中间插有其他作物，这就给田间管理带来不便；水利建设也还不能充分满足灌溉需要；肥料没有完全采取就地制造就地使用的办法，因而在运肥方面多化了劳动力。通过总结今年小麦大面积丰产经验，进一步鼓舞了广大干部和群众为争取明年小麦大面积丰产的信心。这个大队党总支，提出了今年秋种大搞万亩丰产片的计划，计划中不仅要求今年秋种面积比去年同期扩大66％，而且在单位面积产量上要求平均亩产千斤。这个计划一经提出，得到全体社员的一致拥护。
    为了实现今年小麦千斤丰产片的计划，王老家大队根据公社化后可以在更大范围内统一规划土地和集中、合理使用人力的有利条件，决定不在麦田中间插花种其他作物，合并连成了一片小麦万亩丰产片。同时，以培养小麦丰产片计划为中心，大力进行基本建设工作，确定今年秋种前，万亩小麦丰产片全部实行园田化。为此，计划挖三条大干渠，十六条支渠，一千条毛渠；并计划打井二千眼，要求五亩一井，以充分保证麦田用水需要。为了提高肥料质量，这个大队扩建了四十四个土化肥厂，以保证每亩施足底肥三百担，其中每亩要施饼肥、化肥达三十斤，比去年施肥量增加三倍。还要做到田头积肥，实行十亩一粪池，以达到施肥及时，减少运肥环节。
    王老家大队采取抓早、抓快、抓好的办法，积极进行了今年秋种各项准备工作。早在夏种基本结束时，便在不影响秋田管理工作的条件下，抽出占全大队30％的劳动力投入秋种准备工作。从7月份到现在，秋种积肥专业已积各种农家肥一百五十万担，其中一百万担已运到田头，并生产土化肥十五万多斤；一千人组成了水利大军，已开挖十五万四千多土方工程。结合当前抗旱保苗运动，打井一千四百眼。这个大队又从今年上半年积累资金中，抽出一万五千元，为秋种小麦购买饼肥二十万斤，六十马力抽水机一部；全大队利用夜校及生产空隙时间，训练了包括老农、青年、党团员、生产队长、组长的掌耧手，深耕整地手，种子处理手六百人。在麦种上，已将二十五万斤“南大二四一九”小麦良种进行了翻晒和发芽率的试验。公社党委为了帮助这个大队解决劳力不足的困难，抽调了五台拖拉机代耕，现在已将四千二百亩收割完了的早秋作物全部机耕一遍，深耕在一尺左右。
    这个大队在提前做好秋种准备工作的基础上，计划在寒露后五天内将一万亩小麦全部适时种完。
