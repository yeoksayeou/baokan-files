    In celebration of the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, at its ninth session, decided, based on the suggestion of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, to grant amnesty to a group of war criminals, counter-revolutionary criminals, and ordinary criminal offenders who have genuinely repented and reformed. Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, issued the amnesty decree. Simultaneously, the Central Committee of the CCP and the State Council issued the "Decision on the Handling of Rightists Who Have Genuinely Shown Improvement," deciding to remove the "rightist" label from those rightists who have genuinely shown improvement. This is a significant event in the current political life of our country.
    Over the past ten years since the founding of the nation, the People's Government, in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and to ensure the smooth progress of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, has arrested and detained a considerable number of war criminals and counter-revolutionary criminals from the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the puppet Manchurian regime, because they committed serious crimes against the people. It has also arrested and sentenced a considerable number of ordinary criminal offenders who endanger social order. The People's Government has consistently adopted a policy of combining punishment with leniency, and combining labor reform with ideological education, towards these criminals. This is because reforming the various types of criminals left over from the old China is a historic task for us to thoroughly complete the socialist revolution, and is part of the great work of the proletariat to transform society and transform mankind. These criminals were in the position of oppressors and exploiters for a long time, exploiting and harming the people with various cruel means, and undermining the national democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction. In their minds, not only are there deeply rooted reactionary worldviews, reactionary stances, and viewpoints, but they are also permeated with the decadent habits of parasites. To reform them, to make them new people, it is absolutely impossible to succeed without launching serious political and ideological struggles, and without forcing them to transform themselves through labor production. Our policy of combining labor reform with ideological education for criminals specifically means that we both force them to participate in labor production so that they gradually establish labor viewpoints and labor habits, and guarantee them the necessary conditions for production and life; we both thoroughly expose and criticize their reactionary crimes, reactionary stances, and viewpoints, and point out the path for them to become new people. Therefore, the labor reform of criminals is a continuation of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, and is a combination of class struggle and revolutionary humanitarianism. Under the influence of the Party's policy, a large number of criminals have gradually seen light and truth from the dark abyss of sin through personal experiences in labor production and through a series of political and ideological struggles and educational enlightenments. Many criminals have shown remorse and obedience to the law in their actual actions, actively participating in labor production and ideological reform, and have changed from originally despising labor to actively participating in labor. Those who originally had no skills have now learned certain production skills. The success of our reform of criminals has enabled many criminals to genuinely repent and reform, turning negative factors into positive factors. This is a great victory for the Party's policy. In the past ten years, the People's Government has successively released, in accordance with the law, those counter-revolutionary criminals and ordinary criminal offenders who have served their sentences and have genuinely repented and reformed.
    Now, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has decided to grant amnesty to war criminals, counter-revolutionary criminals, and ordinary criminal offenders who have genuinely repented and reformed. This is the application and development of the Party's policy of combining punishment with leniency and combining labor reform with ideological education under the new historical conditions of our country. The current political and economic situation in our country is extremely good. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have achieved great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement have created unprecedented brilliant achievements. Our great motherland is thriving, production and construction are developing rapidly, and people's lives are improving day by day. The people's democratic dictatorship is unprecedentedly consolidated and powerful, and the political consciousness and organizational level of the people across the country are unprecedentedly improved. At the same time, due to the implementation of the Party's policy of combining punishment with leniency and combining labor reform with ideological education, the various criminals in custody are changing for the better after labor reform, and many have genuinely repented and reformed. As the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China approaches, it is appropriate to grant amnesty to a portion of the criminals in custody in order to celebrate our great victory. Doing so will have a significant educational effect on these criminals and other criminals in custody, making them feel that under our great socialist system, as long as they repent and reform, they will have their own future. At the same time, taking this measure will also be conducive to further disintegrating,瓦解 [Wǎjiě-disintegrate] and thoroughly eliminating the remaining reactionary forces.
    The bourgeois rightists exposed in the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957 were bourgeois reactionaries. They were anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist, and were also guilty. It was only because the Party and the government adopted the correct policy of combining strict criticism with lenient handling that they were not treated the same as counter-revolutionaries, but were given opportunities for work, study, and labor, and were subjected to a series of education and reform work. For the past two years, due to the influence of the great victory of the General Line and the help and supervision of the people, the education and reform work of the rightists has achieved great success. Many of the rightists have truly recognized their mistakes and have indeed shown signs of repentance and reform. This is another major victory following the Party's leadership of the people across the country in smashing the rampant attack of the bourgeois rightists in 1957 and achieving a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Removing the hats of a group of rightists who have genuinely improved on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation has significant political significance. What is the standard for having improved? That is, truly recognizing mistakes and genuinely repenting; actively supporting the leadership of the Party and the socialist road in words and deeds, and supporting the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; performing well in work and labor, or making certain contributions to the people's cause. This is a sign of the rightists' reform, and is the dividing line between good and evil. Removing the hats of a portion of the rightists according to this standard can promote them and other rightists to better carry out reform, so that they realize that under the socialist system, as long as they repent and reform, they will definitely have a bright future, and encourage them to continue to work hard in work, labor, and study to carry out self-reform.
    Our country has already realized the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the social roots of crime are gradually disappearing, the phenomenon of crime is decreasing year by year, and the people's political consciousness and organizational strength have been greatly improved. The past exploiting classes and all anti-socialist decadent forces are completely trapped in the vast ocean of the working masses. They have to change even if they don't want to. The general trend of events forces them to do so. There are only two paths before the criminals: as long as they truly repent, they will have a bright future; if they persist in their reactionary stance, they will only be heading for a dead end. The state's amnesty for a portion of the criminals and the removal of the rightist hats for a portion of the rightists points out a path for all counter-revolutionaries, other criminals, and rightists: all those who repent and reform will have their own future. Laying down the butcher knife and becoming a Buddha on the spot, although not an easy task, but a serious struggle, we believe that the majority of the remaining counter-revolutionaries, other criminals, and rightists will eventually gradually recognize the general trend, abandon their reactionary stance, and embark on a new path. There are certainly those who will never change until their death and are willing to go to God with granite brains, but they are ultimately a minority. Moreover, if they continue to resolutely be enemies of the people and dare to sabotage and create disturbances, they will definitely not escape the punishment of the people. This amnesty for a portion of the criminals and the handling of a portion of the rightists once again proves that turning bad people into good people and repenting and reforming is not just an ideal in our country, it has become a reality. A batch of criminals has indeed been reformed by us and received the government's amnesty; a batch of bourgeois rightists has had their hats removed and returned to the ranks of the people. This fact vividly embodies the incomparably consolidated and powerfulness of the great socialist motherland, the power of the people's democratic dictatorship, and superiority of the socialist system.
    Our work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, reforming counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, and reforming rightists has achieved great success. There are fewer and weaker counter-revolutionaries, and rightists are also more isolated. The state's amnesty for a portion of the criminals and the removal of the rightist hats of a portion of the rightists will be more conducive to accelerating the reform of other criminals and rightists, and more conducive to disintegrating, 瓦解 [Wǎjiě-disintegrate] and isolating the enemy, thereby making it more conducive to the struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people against the remaining counter-revolutionary forces and anti-socialist elements, and creating better conditions for the complete victory of the socialist revolution and the continued leap forward in socialist construction. Of course, it should be pointed out that domestic counter-revolutionaries have not been completely eliminated, and anti-socialist thoughts and actions still have certain social roots. At the same time, imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have not relaxed their conspiratorial activities to send special agents and saboteurs to our country. It will take longer to completely accomplish the task of reforming counter-revolutionaries and bourgeois rightists. We have no reason to relax our vigilance against the enemy, and all right-leaning paralysis is wrong. However, we firmly believe that the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country can never be destroyed by any reactionary forces. Our Party's policy of combining punishment with leniency and combining labor reform with ideological education for various criminals, and the policy of educating and reforming anti-socialist rightists, have achieved great victories and will surely achieve even greater victories. In celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, we have reason to cheer for the victory of the Party's policy towards counter-revolutionaries, and cheer for the victory of the Party's policy towards anti-socialist elements.

### 改恶从善　前途光明

    改恶从善　前途光明
    在庆祝伟大的建国十周年的时候，全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九次会议根据毛泽东同志提出的中国共产党中央委员会的建议，决定特赦一批确实已经改恶从善的战争罪犯、反革命罪犯和普通刑事罪犯。中华人民共和国刘少奇主席发布了特赦令。同时，中共中央、国务院也发布了“关于确实表现改好了的右派分子的处理问题的决定”，对确实表现改好了的右派分子决定摘掉他们的右派帽子。这是当前我国政治生活中具有重大意义的事件。
    建国十年来，人民政府为了巩固人民民主专政，为了保证社会主义革命和社会主义建设的顺利进行，曾经逮捕了和关押了相当数量的蒋介石集团和伪满洲国的战争罪犯和反革命罪犯，因为他们对人民犯下了严重的罪行；也逮捕和判处了相当数量的为害社会治安的普通刑事犯。对于这些罪犯，人民政府一贯采取了惩办和宽大相结合、劳动改造和思想教育相结合的政策。这是因为，改造旧中国遗留下来的各种罪犯，是我们彻底完成社会主义革命的一个历史性任务，是无产阶级改造社会、改造人类的伟大工作的一部分。这些罪犯曾经长期居于压迫者和剥削者的地位，用各种残酷手段压榨和残害人民，破坏民族民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设。在他们的头脑里，不但有根深蒂固的反动世界观、反动立场和观点，而且浸透了寄生虫的腐朽的生活恶习。要把他们改造过来，使他们重新作人，不展开严重的政治和思想斗争，不强迫他们从劳动生产中改造自己，是绝对不能成功的。我们对罪犯实行劳动改造和思想教育相结合的政策，具体地说，就是既强迫他们参加劳动生产，使他们逐步树立劳动观点和劳动习惯，又保障他们生产和生活的必需条件；既彻底揭发和批判他们的反动罪行、反动立场和观点，又给他们指出重新作人的道路。因此，劳动改造罪犯乃是革命同反革命的斗争的继续，是阶级斗争同革命人道主义的结合。大批罪犯在党的政策感召下，通过劳动生产的切身感受，通过一系列的政治思想斗争和教育启发，逐步地从黑暗的罪恶深渊中看见了光明和真理。不少罪犯在实际行动上表现认罪服法，积极参加劳动生产和思想改造，已经由原来鄙视劳动转变为积极参加劳动；原来无一技之长的，现在学会了一定的生产技能。我们成功地改造罪犯的结果，使不少罪犯都有了确实改恶从善的表现，使消极因素化为积极因素，这是党的政策的伟大胜利。在过去的十年中，人民政府对于那些服刑期满并且确实改恶从善的反革命罪犯和普通刑事犯，都已陆续依法释放。
    现在全国人民代表大会常务委员会决定对确实改恶从善的战争罪犯、反革命罪犯和普通刑事罪犯实行特赦，这是党的惩办和宽大相结合、劳动改造和思想教育相结合的政策在我国新的历史条件下的运用和发展。当前我国的政治经济形势极为良好。我国各族人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和伟大领袖毛泽东同志的英明领导下，已经取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。总路线、大跃进、人民公社运动，创造了史无前例的辉煌成就。我们伟大的祖国欣欣向荣，生产建设飞跃发展，人民生活日益改善。人民民主专政的政权空前巩固和强大，全国人民的政治觉悟和组织程度空前提高。同时，由于党的惩办和宽大相结合、劳动改造和思想教育相结合的政策的贯彻执行，在押的各种罪犯经过劳动改造，多数正在向好的方面变化，不少人已确实改恶从善。当伟大的中华人民共和国成立十周年到来的时候，为了庆祝我们的伟大胜利，对一部分在押罪犯实行特赦，是适宜的。这样做，对于这些罪犯和其他在押罪犯的继续改造，将有重大的教育作用，使他们感到在我们伟大的社会主义制度下，只要改恶从善，都有自己的前途。同时，采取这一措施，也有利于进一步分化瓦解和彻底肃清残余的反动势力。
    1957年反右派斗争中揭发出来的资产阶级右派分子，是资产阶级反动派。他们反党、反人民、反社会主义，也是有罪的。只是由于党和政府采取了批判从严、处理从宽相结合的正确处理方针，没有把他们同反革命分子一样对待，给他们以工作、学习和劳动的机会，对他们进行了一系列的教育和改造的工作。两年以来，由于总路线的伟大胜利的影响，由于人民群众的帮助和监督，对右派分子的教育和改造工作已获得了很大的成就。右派分子中有不少的人真正认识了自己的错误，确有改恶从善的表现。这是继1957年党领导全国人民粉碎资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻、取得社会主义革命在政治战线和思想战线伟大胜利后的又一次重大的胜利。在建国十周年的时候，摘掉一批确实改好了的右派分子的帽子，有重大的政治意义。什么是改好了的标准呢？这就是真正认识错误，确实悔改；在言论上、行动上积极拥护党的领导和社会主义道路，拥护总路线、大跃进和人民公社；在工作和劳动中表现好，或者对人民事业有一定的贡献。这是右派分子改造的标志，是善与恶的分界线。根据这个标准来摘掉一部分右派分子的帽子，可以促使他们和其他右派分子更好地进行改造，使他们认识到在社会主义制度下，只要改恶从善，就一定会有光明的前途，鼓励他们在工作、劳动和学习中继续努力进行自我改造。
    我国已经实现了生产资料社会主义所有制的变革，产生犯罪的社会根源正在逐步消失，犯罪现象正在一年比一年减少，人民的政治觉悟和组织力量有了极大的提高。过去的剥削阶级，一切反社会主义的腐朽力量，都完全陷落在劳动群众的汪洋大海中，他们不想变也得变。大势所趋，形势逼人。摆在罪犯面前的只有两条道路：只要真正悔改，就有光明前途；坚持反动立场，就是自走绝路。国家特赦一部分罪犯和摘掉一部分右派分子的右派帽子，给一切反革命分子、其他犯罪分子和右派分子指明了一条道路：所有改恶从善、改邪归正的人，都有自己的前途。放下屠刀，立地成佛，虽然不是轻而易举的事，而是一场严重的斗争，但是，我们相信，残余的反革命分子、其他犯罪分子和右派分子中的多数，终会逐步认清大势，抛弃反动立场，走上新的道路。至死不变、愿意带着花岗岩头脑去见上帝的人，肯定有的，但终究是少数。而且，他们如果继续坚决与人民为敌，敢于破坏和捣乱，那是一定逃不脱人民的惩罚的。这次特赦一部分罪犯和处理一部分右派分子，再次证明：坏人变成好人，改恶从善，这在我们国家里已经不只是理想，已经成为现实。一批罪犯确实被我们改造好了，得到了政府的特赦；一批资产阶级右派分子摘掉了帽子，回到了人民的行列。这一事实，生动地体现了伟大的社会主义祖国的无比的巩固和强大，人民民主专政的威力和社会主义制度的优越性。
    我国的肃反工作和对反革命分子、其他罪犯的改造工作，对右派分子的改造工作，已经取得了伟大的成绩，反革命分子更少、更弱了，右派分子也更加孤立了。国家特赦一部分罪犯和摘掉一部分右派分子的右派帽子，将更有利于对其他罪犯和右派分子加速改造，更有利于分化、瓦解和孤立敌人，从而更有利于无产阶级、革命人民对反革命残余势力、反社会主义分子的斗争，为社会主义革命的彻底胜利和社会主义建设的继续跃进创造更好的条件。当然，应当指出，国内的反革命分子还没有完全肃清，反社会主义的思想和行动也还有一定的社会根源。同时，帝国主义和蒋介石集团也没有放松向国内派遣特务破坏分子的阴谋活动。彻底完成改造反革命分子和资产阶级右派分子的任务，则需要花费更长的时间。我们没有任何理由松懈对敌人的警惕，一切右倾麻痹思想都是错误的。但是，我们深信，我国人民的伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，决不是任何反动势力所能破坏得了的。我们党的对各种罪犯的惩办和宽大相结合、劳动改造和思想教育相结合的政策，对反社会主义的右派分子的教育和改造政策，已经取得了很大的胜利，还必将取得更大的胜利。在庆祝建国十周年的时候，我们有理由欢呼党的对反革命分子的政策的胜利，欢呼党的对反社会主义分子的政策的胜利。
