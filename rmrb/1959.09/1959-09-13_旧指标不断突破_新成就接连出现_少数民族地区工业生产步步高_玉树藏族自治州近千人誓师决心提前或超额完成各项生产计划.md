Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Workers on the industrial front in minority areas are creating outstanding production achievements as a gift to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the great National Day.

	A production increase and economy campaign centered on completing production plans ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas has been widely launched in many factories and mines. As of the end of August, the various ethnic groups of workers in the industrial system of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture had already exceeded the original industrial output value plan. Now they have put forward new leap forward goals, guaranteeing to complete the task of 25 million yuan in industrial output value this year, and to complete 80% of the total task before National Day. The workers of all ethnic groups in the Luzhai Branch of the Liuzhou Iron and Steel Plant in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which grew out of the large-scale iron and steel production campaign, are advancing victoriously on the basis of their iron production victory in August, determined to complete the third quarter's pig iron production plan eight days ahead of schedule and exceed the quota by 160 tons. More than 2,300 workers of Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups at the October Tractor Factory in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are conducting a vigorous competition. After Aishan Sedeq's team in the metalworking workshop was rated as a defect-free team in August, they proposed to increase the types of automobile parts produced in September from more than ten to more than forty. The casting workshop launched a master-apprentice competition. The apprentice Wuful Yunu studied technology diligently. In September, he surpassed his Han master Zhang Meitang with a daily output of 75 cartwheels, increasing efficiency by two times. Tibetan workers in factories and enterprises such as the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory, Power Plant, and Carpet Factory in Tibet are also carrying out a red flag competition to "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced" together with Han workers, striving to overfulfill production tasks.
	Workers in various minority areas have already made many new achievements in the production increase and economy campaign. After the workers of the Hohhot No. 1 Wool Textile Factory launched a product defect-free movement, the product quality of Zhao Guiying, a Manchu female worker, has greatly exceeded the standards stipulated in the factory, achieving product defect-free status. Deng Youquan, a Mongolian foundry worker, organized all the workers in the group to study technology and rectify the labor organization, so that the production efficiency of water pump fittings increased from two per shift for eight people to three per shift for six people. The Tibetan workers of the Lhasa Carpet Factory in Tibet are full of energy. The original average daily carpet weaving was seven and a half inches per person, but it has now increased to one foot and eight tenths of an inch. Communist Youth League member Jiayang Cairin said: "The Party is our guiding light, and wherever it points, we guarantee to do it." They are determined to create a new record of weaving an average of one foot and one inch of carpet per day as a gift to celebrate the 10th anniversary of National Day. In the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, many liberated slaves have now become the first generation of Yi workers. The Yi workers in the Zhaojue Agricultural Implement Factory, together with the Han workers, have shortened the time for melting a furnace of iron from one hour to 45 minutes; they rushed to repair the small blast furnace in high temperature, shortening the overhaul time by half. Workers in the electrician Wang Zeqin's (Buyi ethnic group) team in the tool workshop of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture General Machinery Factory in Guizhou Province, in addition to completing the external line installation work of their own group, took the initiative to undertake the task of producing 358 foreign shovels in September. They used their brains to change the manual blanking to machine blanking, which increased the work efficiency by ten times, and completed the production task of foreign shovels 25 days ahead of schedule. From September 5th, they started doing the work for October.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 10th dispatch: The Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, the earliest established Tibetan autonomous prefecture in the country, held a nearly 1,000-person leap forward oath-taking rally on September 2nd. Factory and mine enterprise workers, government cadres, and school teachers and students of Tibetan and Han ethnic groups put forward their goals, resolutely implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and were determined to greet the 10th anniversary of National Day with achievements in fulfilling or exceeding various production plans ahead of schedule.

At the meeting, Zhao Kunyuan, secretary of the Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, pointed out with irrefutable facts the tremendous achievements brought by the General Line, the People's Commune, and the Great Leap Forward to various production and construction tasks in the prefecture. He said that the autonomous prefecture, which was originally dominated by a single pastoral economy, realized the people's communeization after last year's socialist revolution. Due to the implementation of the policy of "pastoralism as the mainstay, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," the total grain output last year reached more than 24 million catties, an increase of 71% compared with 1957; this year's grain output will be even greater than last year. In last year's Great Leap Forward, the prefecture also established 31 small-scale factories and mines, and newly built more than 660 kilometers of highways; the number of primary and secondary schools developed to 114, including 14 secondary schools, an increase of 8.7 times compared with 1957, and the number of students enrolled increased by 9.1 times. After rectification and consolidation, the superiority of the people's communes is becoming more and more significant, and after the continuous development of production, the income of the vast number of commune members has also greatly increased.

At present, the 180,000 mu of grain crops growing well in the autonomous prefecture have begun to be harvested; the autumn is high and the grass is fat on the grasslands, which is a good season for gaining weight and breeding. The farmers and herdsmen of the prefecture are fighting for an overfulfilled harvest of grain and livestock this year.

    旧指标不断突破　新成就接连出现
    少数民族地区工业生产步步高
    玉树藏族自治州近千人誓师决心提前或超额完成各项生产计划
    新华社10日讯　少数民族地区工业战线上的职工们纷纷创造出色的生产成就，作为向伟大国庆十周年的献礼。
    以提前和超额完成生产计划为中心的增产节约运动，已经在许多厂矿中广泛展开。甘南藏族自治州工业系统的各民族职工，今年到8月底已经超额完成原订的工业产值计划，现在他们又提出新的跃进目标，保证在今年内完成工业产值二千五百万元的任务，并且在国庆节前完成总任务的80％。在大办钢铁中成长起来的广西僮族自治区柳州钢铁厂鹿寨分厂各民族职工，在8月夺铁大捷的基础上，正乘胜前进，决心提前八天超额一百六十吨完成第三季度的生铁生产计划。新疆维吾尔自治区十月拖拉机厂的两千三百多名维吾尔、哈萨克、回、汉等民族职工，竞赛搞得轰轰烈烈。金工车间的艾山斯得克小组在8月份被评为无废品小组以后，提出9月份要把生产汽车零件的种类，从十多种增加到四十多种。铸工车间开展师徒竞赛，徒工吾甫尔玉努斯苦心钻研技术，9月份以日产七十五个斗车轮子的成绩，超过了他的汉族师傅张梅堂，工效提高两倍。西藏拉萨汽车修配厂、电厂、地毯厂等工厂企业的藏族职工，也同汉族工人一道，开展“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的红旗竞赛，争取超额完成生产任务。
    各少数民族地区职工已经在增产节约运动中作出了许多新的成绩。呼和浩特市第一毛纺厂工人开展产品无疵点运动以后，满族女工赵桂英的产品质量已大大超过厂内规定的标准，作到了产品无疵点。蒙古族铸工邓友泉组织全组工人研究技术，整顿劳动组织，使水泵管件的生产效率由原先的八个人一班生产两个提高到六个人一班生产三个。西藏拉萨地毯厂的藏族职工个个干劲十足，原来平均每人每天织毯七寸半，现在已提高到一尺零八分。共青团员甲央才仁说：“党是我们的指路明灯，指到哪里，我们保证作到哪里。”他们决心创造平均每天织毯一尺一寸的新纪录，作为国庆十周年的献礼。在凉山彝族自治州，许多解放了的奴隶现在成了彝族中的第一代工人。昭觉农具厂的彝族工人，同汉族工人一起，化一炉铁水的时间已由一小时缩短到四十五分钟；冒着高温抢修小高炉，使检修时间缩短了一半。贵州黔南布依族苗族自治州通用机械厂工具车间电工王泽勤（布依族）小组的工人，在完成本组的外线安装工作以外，主动担负起9月份生产三百五十八把洋铲的任务。他们开动脑筋，改人工下料为机器下料，使工效提高十倍，已经提前二十五天完成了洋铲生产任务。从9月5日起，就开始做10月份的工作了。
    新华社西宁10日电　全国成立最早的藏族自治州——青海省玉树藏族自治州9月2日举行了近千人的跃进誓师大会，藏、汉族的厂矿企业职工、机关干部、学校师生纷纷提出奋斗目标，坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会决议，决心以提前或超额完成各项生产计划的成就，迎接国庆十周年。
    会上，自治州州委书记赵昆元以无可辩驳的事实，指出了总路线、人民公社、大跃进给全州各项生产建设工作带来的巨大成就。他说，原来以单一的牧业经济为主的自治州，经过去年的社会主义革命，实现了人民公社化。由于贯彻执行了“以牧为主、农牧结合、开展多种经营”的方针，去年粮食总产量达到二千四百多万斤，比1957年增长71％；今年粮食产量比去年将有更大增长。在去年的大跃进中，全州还建立小型厂矿三十一处，新修公路六百六十多公里；中小学发展到一百一十四所，其中中等学校十四所，比1957年增长八点七倍，在校学生增长九点一倍。人民公社经过整顿巩固，优越性越来越显著，生产不断发展以后，广大社员收入也有了很大增长。
    目前，自治州生长良好的十八万亩粮食作物开始抢收；草原上秋高草肥，正是抓膘、配种的良好季节，全州农牧民正在为今年的粮畜超额丰收而战斗。
