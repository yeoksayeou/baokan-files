Capitalist Countries' Unemployed Army Expands
Production Automation Drives Many Workers Out of Factories

(Report from our newspaper) This year, although the economies of capitalist countries have rebounded somewhat, the employment situation of industrial workers in capitalist countries has not improved accordingly. With large monopoly enterprises widely implementing production automation and laying off workers, many industrial sectors' workers are facing greater threats to their livelihoods as their jobs are replaced by machines.

In the United States, although the industrial production index has broken through the pre-crisis high of 146 in December 1956 (1947-1949 being 100), increasing to 155 in June of this year, the number of industrial workers employed has remained at 16.4 million, lower than any period since mid-1955 (except during the strike in July 1956).

In Britain, although the official manufacturing production index has increased since 1956, the number of people employed in manufacturing this year is several hundred thousand fewer than three years ago.

In France, which claims to have achieved "high full employment," industrial workers in many sectors are also suffering from the disaster of production automation. According to the "New France" weekly in June of this year, France's textile production this year has increased by 14% compared to 1952, but the number of people it employs has fallen from 510,000 in 1952 to 380,000. Among these 380,000 people, nearly 150,000 are in a state of semi-unemployment.

In Italy, industrial production in April of this year was 12.6% higher than in the same month last year, but the unemployment situation has not improved compared to last year. At the beginning of this year, the total number of unemployed workers increased to 2 million, even higher than the unemployment figures at the beginning of 1958.

West Germany's slight unemployment situation has recently been regarded as the only "miracle" among Western capitalist countries. According to official unemployment statistics for July, there were only 215,000 unemployed, accounting for only 1.1% of the employed population. However, even in this capitalist country with the lowest unemployment, coal miners are facing unprecedented misfortune. Due to the mechanization of coal mining and "surplus" coal production, more than 42,000 miners in the Ruhr alone have been laid off since February of last year, and more than 5.5 million miners have been forced to work in shifts.

### 资本主义国家失业大军扩大  生产自动化把许多工人撵出工厂

    资本主义国家失业大军扩大
    生产自动化把许多工人撵出工厂
    本报讯　今年以来，资本主义世界各国的经济虽然有所回升，但是，资本主义国家产业工人的就业情况却没有因此得到相应的改善。在大垄断企业广泛实行生产自动化、裁减工人的情况下，许多产业部门的工人由于工作为机器所代替，生活受到了更大的威胁。
    在美国，虽然工业生产指数已突破1956年12月危机前的最高点一百四十六（1947—1949年为一百）增加到今年6月份的一百五十五，可是产业工人的就业人数却停留在一千六百四十万人的水平，低于从1955年年中以来的任何时期（1956年7月罢工时除外）。
    在英国，尽管从1956年以来官方发表的制造业生产指数已有所增加，可是今年制造业的就业人数却比三年前少了十几万人。
    在号称已经达到“高度充分就业”的法国，同样有不少部门的产业工人受到生产自动化的灾难。据今年6月“新法兰西”周刊透露：今年法国纺织业的产量比1952年增加了14％，但是它所雇用的人数却从1952年的五十一万人下降到三十八万人，在这三十八万人中，还有近十五万人处于半失业状态。
    在意大利，今年4月的工业生产比去年同月高了12.6％，但是失业情况和去年相比却未见改善。今年年初全失业工人曾增加到二百万人，甚至比1958年初的失业数字还要高。
    西德失业情况的轻微最近被认为是西方资本主义国家所仅有的“奇迹”。据官方发表的7月份失业统计数字，失业者只有二十一万五千人，即仅占就业人数的1.1％。可是甚至在这个失业最少的资本主义国家里，煤矿工人却面临前所未有的厄运。由于采煤工作的机械化和煤产量“过剩”，从去年2月份以来，仅鲁尔就有四万二千多名矿工被解雇，五百五十多万矿工被迫轮班歇工。
