Xinhua News Agency, September 21st -- TASS released on September 21st a communiqué on the preliminary results of the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket to the Moon. The full text of the communiqué is as follows:

      Rocket Reached the Moon Perfectly Along the Pre-Planned Trajectory
    The Soviet cosmic rocket, launched on September 12, 1959, reached the surface of the Moon at 0:02:24 Moscow time on September 14.
    The Soviet multi-stage cosmic rocket accurately flew towards the Moon along the pre-calculated trajectory. All systems, units, and components of the rocket operated normally during the flight.
    The radio-technical equipment installed on the rocket ensured reliable tracking of the rocket's flight from the ground. Tracking started from the moment of the rocket's launch until the container with scientific instruments reached the surface of the Moon.
    The smooth operation of the complete set of automatic measuring equipment on the ground made it possible to continuously monitor whether the actual trajectory of the second Soviet cosmic rocket's operation conformed to the predetermined data, make reliable predictions of its arrival on the Moon, and determine the arrival area.
    Due to the analysis of the actual trajectory of the second Soviet cosmic rocket's operation based on recorded measurement and observation data, it is now possible to preliminarily determine the arrival area of the container equipped with scientific instruments and measuring instruments, as well as the rocket's last stage. The results of processing the observation materials indicate that the container of the second Soviet cosmic rocket reached the lunar surface east of the "Sea of ​​Serenity," near the three craters Aristeides, Archimedes, and Autolycus. According to the obtained data, the point where the container collided with the lunar surface is at a lunar latitude of positive 30 degrees and a lunar longitude of 0 degrees.
    The point where the instrument-carrying container reached the Moon is approximately eight hundred kilometers away from the center of the Moon's visible disk.
    At the time of the container's collision with the Moon, its trajectory formed a 60-degree angle with the lunar surface. At this time, the container's speed relative to the Moon was approximately 3.3 kilometers per second.
    The results of processing the obtained materials prove that the last stage of the cosmic rocket also reached the lunar surface.
      Materials Obtained from Telemetry During the Rocket's Flight to the Moon
    As previously reported, during the flight of the second Soviet cosmic rocket to the Moon, preparations were made to study the Earth's magnetic field and the Moon's magnetic field, study the radiation belts around the Earth, study the intensity of cosmic radiation, study heavy nuclei in cosmic radiation, study the gaseous composition of interstellar matter, and study meteor particles.
    The materials obtained from the study results prove that the scientific and telemetry instruments installed in the container were working normally.
    Preliminary decoding work has been carried out on the telemetry materials.
    Based on the preliminary materials obtained, it is now possible to determine:
    -- According to the materials recorded by the magnetometer, no magnetic field was found near the Moon within its sensitivity and deviation range (60 gamma).
    -- Measurements of radiation intensity near the Moon did not detect radiation belts of charged particles. This fact is consistent with the magnetic measurement results.
    -- The total amount of cosmic radiation flow, the flow of helium nuclei (alpha particles), carbon nuclei, nitrogen nuclei, oxygen nuclei, and heavier nuclei that make up cosmic rays were measured in the cosmic space traversed by the rocket.
    -- Additional materials were obtained regarding X-rays, gamma rays, electrons of different energy levels, and high-energy particles.
    -- Measurements were carried out within the Earth's radiation belt.
    -- The electric current caused by ionized gas particles entering the container from the four positive-charge particle collectors around the container was registered. The magnitude of the registered current varied along the rocket's flight path; preliminary estimates indicate that there are areas between the Earth and the Moon with less than one hundred ionized particles per cubic centimeter. The recorded current increased continuously about 10,000 kilometers from the Moon. This may be due to a shell composed of ionized gas around the Moon—a special lunar ionosphere, or an area with a high concentration of particles with an energy of about tens of volts around the Moon.
    -- New materials were obtained on micro-meteorites.
    Further processing and analysis of the obtained materials are now underway.
    The research results will be published as they are processed.
      Launching a Rocket to the Moon Requires a High Level of Science and Technology
    The creation of a multi-stage cosmic rocket, engine, flight control system, and a complete set of ground equipment to ensure the rocket's accurate launch and highly accurate operation when flying to the Moon, as well as the reliable monitoring of its flight before the rocket collided with the Moon, are all outstanding achievements of Soviet science and technology.
    The launch of the second Soviet cosmic rocket, the set of scientific research carried out this time, and the rocket's arrival on the lunar surface will all make significant contributions to world science and to the cause of mankind's conquest of the universe.
    It was only possible to complete the flight from Earth to the Moon because Soviet science and technology reached a high level of development. To achieve this flight, it was necessary to manufacture sophisticated multi-stage rockets, powerful rocket engines using high-heat fuel, an extremely precise system for controlling the rocket's flight, ground launch equipment, and a complete set of automated measuring instruments for observing the flight.
    Theoretical explorations and technical calculations were carried out before the rocket launch. These works made it possible to determine the best orbital parameters and launch time to ensure reaching the Moon under the most favorable conditions.
    In principle, launching a cosmic rocket to the Moon is possible on any day, that is, the rocket can be launched towards it regardless of the Moon's arbitrary position on its orbit around the Earth. After calculation, a day was chosen when launching the rocket towards the Moon, the angle of the rocket's flight relative to the Earth's surface was the smallest, which minimized the speed loss due to the Earth's gravity and ensured that the maximum effective weight was sent to the Moon.
    To ensure the correctness of the orbit at the end of the rocket's acceleration phase, a control system was installed on the rocket. This system was working throughout the entire acceleration phase (approximately a few minutes). The rocket's subsequent one and a half days of flight were uncontrolled, flying only under the action of the gravitational fields of the Earth, the Moon, and other celestial bodies.
    All calculations of the operating conditions at the end of the rocket's acceleration phase must be extremely precise. It is sufficient to mention the following to illustrate this: a difference of just one meter per second in speed (one ten-thousandth of the full speed) would cause a deviation of 250 kilometers in the point of collision with the Moon. A difference of ten seconds in the launch time would cause a difference of 200 kilometers in the collision point.
    The launch time of the second Soviet cosmic rocket differed from the scheduled time by about one second. Such precise rocket launch proves that the launch system is very perfect and the automatic launch device is very reliable.
      Measuring and Calculating Institutions are All Automated Devices
    Establishing dedicated measuring and calculating institutions to quickly determine the rocket's operating conditions is important for the rocket's flight. It is not possible to use the usual method of determining the operation of cosmic bodies here. Therefore, the measurement of the rocket's operation is based on radio methods. All these special circumstances were fully considered when preparing the complete set of automated measuring equipment. They made it possible to measure the rocket's position very accurately.
    All necessary operations are carried out by a specially designed digital information computer, in which an information memory system is also adopted. All information is sent to the calculating device, which can perform necessary calculations on the coordinates of the rocket's collision with the Moon and other data.
    All measurement points are connected by a special communication system, through which the obtained data can be transmitted to the calculation center in a timely manner. After the first batch of data received in twenty to thirty minutes is processed, it is possible to calculate its continued operating orbit within the first hour of the rocket's flight and confirm that the rocket can reach the Moon very accurately. At the same time, it also indicates to Soviet or foreign measuring stations how to carry out measurements and observations in the future.
    According to these data, it was determined that the predetermined collision point of the rocket with the Moon was in the northern part of the Moon's visible disk. According to later corrected processing results, the location and time of the collision were determined. It was determined at the time that this collision point was in the "Sea of Serenity" area, 800 kilometers away from the center of the Moon's visible disk.
    The exciting news about the launch of the second Soviet cosmic rocket spread around the world. This rocket successfully reached the surface of the Moon at 0:02:24 on September 14. For the first time in human history, a cosmic flight from Earth to another celestial body was completed.
    It was only possible to complete the flight from Earth to the Moon because Soviet science and technology reached a high level of development. The realization of this flight is the result of the efforts of Soviet scientists, designers, engineers, technicians, and workers, and the encouraging labor of the large collective that participated in the manufacturing and launching of the second Soviet cosmic rocket.
    Launching a rocket to the Moon is a very complex scientific and technological problem.
    To fly to the Moon, it is necessary to manufacture highly perfected multi-stage rockets, powerful rocket engines using high-heat fuel, highly accurate systems for controlling the rocket's flight, ground launch equipment, and a complete set of automatic measuring instruments for observing the rocket's flight.
      Knowledge of the Moon's Operation and Flight Orbit Issues
    To understand the accuracy of the rocket control, the requirements for the automation technology of the launching platform, and the measuring institutions for solving the problem of launching a rocket to the Moon, some information on the Moon's operation and certain issues related to the selection of the flight orbit are introduced below.
    We recall the main characteristics of the Moon's operation known in astronomy. The Moon is a satellite of the Earth, and it revolves around the Earth along an orbit that is close to a circle. The orbital plane of the Moon now forms an angle of approximately eighteen degrees with the equatorial plane of the Earth. Due to this, when operating along the orbit, the inclination of the Moon, that is, the angle between the direction from the center of the Earth to the Moon and the equatorial plane of the Earth, changes between eighteen degrees and negative eighteen degrees. The time for the Moon to revolve around the Earth once is approximately twenty-seven point three days and nights. The distance between the Moon and the Earth varies between 356,400 kilometers (at the perigee of the orbit) and 406,670 kilometers (apogee), with an average distance of 384,386 kilometers. The speed of the Moon along the orbit is approximately one kilometer per second. At this speed, the Moon draws an arc of nearly thirteen degrees on the celestial sphere in one day and night.
    The orbit of the rocket flying to the Moon is composed of two parts: the accelerated flight segment - the rocket reaches a certain altitude under the action of the engine's thrust, and obtains the necessary speed; the free flight segment - this flight segment begins after the engine of the last stage of the rocket is shut down and the container is separated. The container is separated from the last stage of the rocket by mechanical means, and the container is given a small additional speed.
    According to the theorem of celestial mechanics, the orbit of the rocket freely flying towards the Moon after the engine is shut down has a long section where the Moon's gravity is relatively small, and the shape of the orbit is close to a hyperbola, with the center of the Earth as one focus of the hyperbola.
    As it gets farther and farther away from the Earth, the operating speed gradually decreases to two kilometers per second. Later, due to the gradually increasing influence of the Moon's gravity, the speed no longer decreases and begins to increase until it collides with the lunar surface. The speed at the time of collision with the Moon reaches 3.3 kilometers per second.
 How to Ensure Reaching the Moon Under the Most Favorable Conditions
    Before launching the rocket to the Moon, theoretical explorations and technical calculations were carried out to determine the orbital parameters and launch time, ensuring that the Moon was reached under the most favorable conditions. Now let's talk about this in detail.
    In principle, launching a rocket to the Moon is possible on any day, regardless of the Moon's position in its orbit around the Earth. However, calculations have proven that from the ground within the vast territory of the Soviet Union, the most favorable moment for launching a rocket in terms of power consumption is when the Moon is near the intersection of its orbit with the smallest declination, that is, when the Moon's declination is close to eighteen degrees (negative eighteen degrees). In this case, the rocket will fly at the smallest angle to the Earth's surface during the acceleration phase, and the speed lost due to the Earth's gravity will also be the smallest, which will ensure that the maximum effective weight can be sent to the Moon. A later or earlier rocket launch date will reduce the weight of the possible effective weight. However, if the difference is only a few days, this loss is relatively small. Within each month, a time span of about one week can be indicated, during which the rocket's flight to the Moon is suitable. If it is far from this optimal period, the possible effective weight will be greatly reduced.
    Within the above time span, the Moon's position should be above the horizon when the rocket collides with the Moon. In the flight of a cosmic rocket, the selection of the time when the rocket collides with the Moon should be made so that their mutual approach occurs during the period when the Moon is at its upper culmination for the observation point, that is, when the Moon's height from the horizon is close to its maximum value. Under these conditions, radio communication conditions are the most favorable.
    The calculation results selected the optimal inclination value of the orbital plane relative to the Earth's equatorial plane, which determined the direction of the rocket's flight orbit in the early stages of its operation for the predetermined launch point. For various different navigation directions, the inclination of the rocket's movement speed during the acceleration phase and the magnitude of the loss caused by the Earth's gravity are different. The conditions for selecting the navigation direction are: the loss is the smallest, thereby maximizing the possible effective weight. At the same time, the problem of facilitating the placement of a complete set of measuring instruments is also taken into account, which are used to monitor the rocket's operation and collect telemetry information on the rocket during the acceleration phase and in the initial stage of free flight after the last stage engine is shut down.
    Calculations show that in the case of flying to the Moon from within the Soviet Union, the Moon should be located close to the lower culmination below the horizon at the time of the rocket launch. That is to say, the launch time should differ from the Moon's upper culmination by approximately half a day and night. If it is taken into account that the Moon should be located at the upper culmination when reaching the Moon, then, obviously, the flight to the Moon should last for half a day and night, or one and a half days and nights, or two and a half days and nights, and so on.
    The duration of the cosmic rocket's continued flight was selected as one and a half days and nights, because a flight time of half a day and night would require a very large initial speed, and if the flight to the Moon was to be completed in two and a half days and nights or more, and the rocket was to be guaranteed to be observed when it met the Moon, this would require much stricter requirements for maintaining the accuracy of the movement parameters at the end of the acceleration phase.
    The selection of the flight duration determined the magnitude of the speed of the rocket at the end of the acceleration phase. As mentioned above, this speed is slightly greater than the parabolic speed.
    The calculation of the rocket's orbit during the acceleration phase and the orbit during the operating phase after the last stage engine is shut down were carried out using high-speed electronic computers. The gravity of the Earth and the Moon was taken into account during the calculation. It is also necessary to consider the deviation of the Earth's gravitational field from the center caused by the Earth's oblateness and the perturbation effect of the Sun's gravity. In order to make the flight of the rocket at the end of the acceleration phase accurately conform to the calculated values, a control system that works throughout the entire acceleration phase, which lasts for a few minutes, is installed on the rocket. The rocket's further one and a half days of continuous flight is uncontrolled, and it flies entirely under the action of the gravitational fields of the Earth, the Moon, and other celestial bodies.
      Ensuring the Rocket's Accurate Operation is a Very Complicated Task
    In order to ensure that the rocket reaches the Moon without any correction to its movement during the rocket's free operating phase, the calculated values ​​of the movement parameters at the end of the acceleration phase should be extremely accurate. For example, as long as the rocket's speed has an error of one meter per second, which is equal to one ten-thousandth of the rocket's speed value, it will cause the point of collision with the Moon to deviate by 250 kilometers.
    If the speed vector differs from the calculated direction by one minute, the collision point will deviate by 200 kilometers. Changes in the coordinates of the location of the rocket when the engine is shut down will also greatly affect the position where the rocket collides with the lunar surface. If all of the above errors and the inaccuracy of the rocket's launch time all work together, the deviation that usually occurs at the point where the rocket collides with the Moon is greater than the deviation that occurs when each factor works alone.
    Given that the radius of the Moon is 1,740 kilometers, in order to ensure that the rocket reliably reaches the Moon, the speed error should be within a few meters per second, and the deviation of the speed vector from its expected direction should not exceed one-tenth of a degree. Ensuring that the rocket's control has such accuracy is a very complicated task.
    It should be pointed out that achieving the flight to the Moon from within the Soviet Union requires more stringent requirements for the accuracy of the control system's work than taking off from near the Earth's equator.
    The necessity of accurately maintaining the calculated launch time is related to the rotation of the rocket's orbital plane with the Earth's rotation. A deviation of ten seconds in the launch time will cause a deviation of 200 kilometers in the point of collision with the lunar surface.
    Achieving an accuracy of a few seconds or less in launching a cosmic rocket at a predetermined time places strict requirements on the organization and preparation of the rocket launch and on the automatic launch system. The accuracy of the launch of the second Soviet cosmic rocket proves the perfection of the launch system and the high reliability of the automatic launch device.
    The takeoff time of the second cosmic rocket differed from the scheduled launch time by approximately one second.
    Establishing a dedicated measuring institution and calculating institution, and establishing a complex set of equipment that can effectively determine the flight characteristics of cosmic rockets, is very important in the problem of cosmic rocket flight.
    Requiring the rapid acquisition of data on the rocket's flight characteristics is a special requirement, and this requirement largely determines the complexity of the entire measurement system. This data is necessary for the observation stations and measuring stations to predict the rocket's operation and calculate the point where the rocket collides with the lunar surface.
    From the above data, it can be seen how much the error of the operating parameters affects the position of the collision point. When determining these parameters based on measurement data, the accuracy should be such that it reaches the accuracy of astronomical calculations.
    The general methods for determining the operating characteristics of cosmic bodies, which have been obtained in astronomical practical work for many years, cannot be applied to the above purposes. Optical measurements, which are the basis of observational astronomy, are indeed unsuitable because the volume of the rocket, this observation target, is very small, and some angular measurements are not accurate enough within a limited observation time. In addition, because these measurements are highly dependent on visibility and the state of the Earth's atmosphere, they are very unreliable.
    Therefore, the measurement institution of cosmic rockets works with radio-technical measurement tools. In this regard, the determination of slant distance, angle, and radial speed is utilized.
    For these characteristics and the requirements for determining the movement parameters of cosmic rockets, the complete set of automatic measurement devices takes them into account as fully as possible. This device can measure the slant distance of the rocket during its operation and its two angles: azimuth angle and position angle very accurately. The measurement materials obtained from the measurement point are transformed into binary code, subjected to preliminary processing, and matched with astronomical time.
    All the above operations are performed by a special digital information machine. This information machine ensures that the measurement materials are automatically sent to each communication line in the form of raw materials or memory information. In the calculation center, the received information can be automatically translated with the help of special electronic equipment and punched into punched cards. Later, the punched cards are sent to an electronic computer. The computer calculates the initial conditions of the rocket's operation, the target indication, and the coordinates of the point where the rocket collides with the Moon based on the measurement materials from each measurement point.
    In order to obtain complete data on the movement of the cosmic rocket during the entire flight stage to the Moon, the distance of the rocket from the Earth, the radial speed of the rocket's movement (that is, its speed of leaving the measurement point), and the angular coordinates: position angle and azimuth angle are continuously measured. The measurement is carried out at a frequency of 183.6 megacycles.
    The telemetry stations on the ground transmit and record the data of scientific observations carried out on the cosmic rocket and the data on the working conditions (temperature and pressure) of the measuring instruments and radio instruments. Scientific data is sent using radio transmitters with frequencies of 183.6, 39.986, and 19.993 megacycles respectively. All the above radio technical equipment is installed inside the container.
    The transmitter working at two frequencies—19.997 megacycles and 20.003 megacycles—conducts radio observation of the flight of the last stage rocket, and sends back additional scientific information about the intensity of cosmic radiation along this radio channel. This information is not sent back from the instruments installed on the container, but from the instruments on the last stage rocket.
      The Collision Point and Time Were Accurately Measured on the Ground
    A large number of complete sets of radio technical instruments in specialized measurement points located throughout the Soviet Union participated in the observation of the second Soviet cosmic rocket. All measurement points are united into a dedicated communication system, which ensures the effective transmission of observation data to the calculation center and the transmission of target indications to each measurement point.
    In order to coordinate the work of the measuring instruments in time and to coordinate the measurement results with a unified time, a specialized institution for unified time was organized.
    The various measurement points in the Soviet Union sent the measurement data to the calculation center within 20 to 30 minutes through automatic communication lines. The preliminary processing of the measurement data made it possible to calculate the rocket's continued operating orbit within the first hour of the cosmic rocket's flight, confirming that the rocket could reach the Moon very accurately, and calculating the indicated targets for further measurement and observation by Soviet and foreign measurement stations.
    According to these data, it can be determined that the expected collision point is in the northern part of the Moon's visible disk.
    Later, these data were subjected to precise research, and with reference to a large amount of supplementary data on the rocket's distance and radial speed, it was possible to determine the location and time of the rocket's collision with the Moon. It has been determined that the collision point is located in the "Sea of Serenity" area, 800 kilometers away from the center of the Moon's visible disk.
    The successful flight of the second Soviet cosmic rocket to the Moon is a very important stage in the study of cosmic space and celestial bodies.

    塔斯社关于苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭初步结果公报
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社21日发表了关于苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭的初步结果的公报。公报全文如下：
      火箭完全沿着预定轨道到达月球
    1959年9月12日发射的苏联宇宙火箭于9月14日莫斯科时间零时零二分二十四秒到达月球表面。
    苏联多级宇宙火箭准确地沿着预定的计算轨道飞向月球。火箭的全部系统、机组和构件在飞行期间工作正常。
    火箭上所装的无线电技术设备保证了从地面对火箭的飞行作可靠的跟踪。跟踪从火箭发射时开始直到装科学仪器的容器到达月球表面为止。
    地面上整套自动测量设备的顺利工作使得有可能不间断地监督飞行的实际轨道是否符合预定的数据，作出到达月球的可靠预报，并确定到达地区。
    由于根据记录下来的各种测量和观测资料对苏联第二个宇宙火箭运行的实际轨道作了分析，在目前就能初步确定装有科学仪器和测量仪器的容器以及火箭的最后一级的到达地区。整理观测材料的结果表明，苏联第二个宇宙火箭的容器到达了“澄海”以东，阿里斯基尔、阿基米德和奥托利克这三座环形山附近的月球表面。根据得到的数据，容器同月球表面相碰之点为月面纬度正三十度，月面经度零度。
    装仪器的容器到达月球之点偏离月球可见圆面中心约八百公里。
    在容器同月球相碰时，它的轨道同月球表面成六十度的交角。这时容器对月球的速度约为每秒三点三公里。
    整理所获得的材料的结果证明，宇宙火箭的最后一级也达到了月球表面。
      火箭飞往月球时遥测所得的材料
    前已报道，在第二个苏联宇宙火箭飞往月球时，准备研究地球磁场和月球磁场，研究地球周围的辐射带，研究宇宙辐射的强度，研究宇宙辐射中的重核，研究星际物质的气体成分，研究流星粒子。
    研究结果获得的材料证明，装在容器中的科学和遥测仪器的工作是正常的。
   已经对遥测的材料进行了初步译解工作。
    根据所获得的初步材料，目前已经可以确定：
    ——根据磁强计记录的材料，靠近月球的磁场在它的灵敏度和偏差度（六十伽傌）的范围内没有发现。
    ——对月球附近辐射强度的测量没有发现带电荷粒子的辐射带。这一事实同磁测量的结果相一致。
    ——在火箭飞过的宇宙空间中测量了宇宙辐射流的总量，氦核（甲种粒子）、碳核、氮核、氧核和组成宇宙线的更重的核的流量。
    ——获得了关于X射线、丙种射线、能量大小不同的电子和高能量粒子的补充材料。
    ——在地球辐射带的范围内进行了测量。
    ——登记了从容器周围进入容器中的四个正电粒子捕集器的电离气体粒子所造成的电流。所登记的电流大小沿着火箭的飞行路线发生变化；初步估计表明，地球和月球之间有一些区域中电离粒子每立方厘米不到一百个。在离月球约一万公里时，所记录的电流不断增加。这可能是由于月球周围有由电离气体组成的外壳——特殊的月球电离层，或者是月球周围有一个能量约数十伏特的微粒高度集中的区域。
    ——获得了关于微流星的新材料。
    现在正在对获得的材料作进一步的整理和分析。
    研究结果将一边整理一边发表。
      向月球发射火箭需要高度科技水平
    多级宇宙火箭、发动机、飞行操纵系统和保证火箭飞往月球时的准确起动和高度准确的运行的全套地面设备的制成，以及在火箭同月球相碰以前对它的飞行的可靠的监督，都是苏联的科学和技术的杰出成就。
    第二个苏联宇宙火箭的发射，这次进行的一套科学研究，以及火箭的到达月面，这一切将对世界科学以及人征服宇宙的事业作出重大的贡献。
    由于苏联科学和技术发展达到了高度水平，完成从地球到月球的飞行才成为可能。为了实现这个飞行，必须制造出完善的多级火箭、使用高热量燃料的强大的火箭发动机、极其精确的控制火箭飞行的系统、地面发射设备以及观测飞行情况的整套自动化测量仪器。
    在发射火箭之前进行了理论探讨和技术计算。这些工作使得能够确定最好的轨道参数和发射时间，以保证在最有利的条件下达到月球。
    向月球发射宇宙火箭原则上在任何一天都可以，也就是说，不论月球在其围绕地球运行轨道的任意的位置上，火箭都可以向它发射。经过计算，选择了这样一天：在这一天向月球发射火箭，火箭飞行时对地球表面的角度最小，这就使速度由于地心引力而遭到的损失达到最小程度，并保证把最大的有效重物送上月球。
    为了保证火箭在加速段末端的轨道正确，在火箭上装有操纵系统。这个系统是在整个加速段（约几分钟）都在工作着。火箭在往后的一昼夜半的飞行是没有操纵的，而只在地球、月球和其他天体引力场的作用下飞行。
    对火箭加速段末端的运行情况的全部计算必须极度精确。只消提一下下面的情况就足以说明这一点：在速度上每秒钟只要差一米（全速的万分之一），同月球相碰点的偏差就会达到二百五十公里。发射时间差十秒钟就会使相碰点相差二百公里。
    苏联第二个宇宙火箭发射时间同预定的相差约一秒钟。这样精确的火箭发射，证明发射系统很完善，发射的自动装置非常可靠。
      测量和计算机构均是自动化装置
    建立专职的测量机构和计算机构来迅速确定火箭运行情况，对火箭的飞行来说是很重要的。这里用通常确定宇宙体运转的方法是不行的。因此火箭运行的测量是以无线电方法为基础的。在准备全套自动化测量装备时，所有这些特殊情况都得到全面充分的考虑。它们使得能够非常精确地测定火箭的位置。
    一切必要的操作都由特制的数字信息计算机进行，在这种机器内也采用信息记忆系统。所有信息都送到计算装置里，这些装置能够对火箭同月球相碰的座标及其他数据进行必要的计算。
    所有测量点都由专门联系系统联结起来，借助于这个系统能把所获得的资料及时地传送到计算中心。把经过二十到三十分钟所收到的首批资料加以整理，就可以在火箭飞行的第一个小时内计算出它继续运行的轨道，并肯定火箭能够十分准确地到达月球。同时还向苏联或外国测量站指出在以后如何进行测量和观测。
    根据这些资料确定，火箭与月球预定相碰之点是在月球可见圆面的北部。根据后来经过校正的整理结果，确定了相碰的位置和时间。当时确定，这个相碰点是在“澄海”区距离月球可见圆面中心八百公里之处。
    关于苏联发射第二个宇宙火箭的振奋人心的消息传遍了全球。这个火箭已于9月14日零时零二分二十四秒成功地抵达月球表面。在人类史上第一次完成了从地球到另一个天体的宇宙飞行。
    由于苏联科学和技术发展达到了高度水平，完成从地球到月球的飞行才有了可能。这次飞行的实现是苏联科学家、设计人员、工程师、技术员和工人努力的成果，是参加制造和发射苏联第二个宇宙火箭的大集体的令人鼓舞的劳动的结果。
    向月球发射火箭是一个十分复杂的科学技术问题。
    为了飞往月球，必须制造高度完善的多级火箭、使用高热量燃料的强大的火箭发动机，高度精确的控制火箭飞行的系统、地面发射设备和观测火箭飞行的整套自动测量仪器。
      有关月球运行知识和飞行轨道问题
    为了了解对火箭控制的准确性、对发射台自动技术以及对解决向月球发射火箭的问题的测量机构的要求，兹介绍一些有关月球运行的资料以及与选择飞行轨道有关的某些问题。
    我们回顾一下天文学中所知道的关于月球运行的主要特点。月球是地球的卫星，它沿着一个接近圆形的轨道环绕着地球运转。月球的轨道面现在同地球的赤道面构成大约十八度的交角。由于这样，在沿着轨道运转时，月球的倾斜，也就是从地球中心到月球的方向同地球赤道面的交角，在十八度到负十八度之间发生变化。月球围绕地球运转一周的时间大约为二十七点三个昼夜。月球同地球的距离是在三十五万六千四百公里（在轨道的近地点）到四十万零六千六百七十公里（远地点）之间变化的，平均距离为三十八万四千三百八十六公里。月球沿着轨道运行的速度大约每秒一公里。月球以这种速度运行一昼夜在天球上画出的弧度将近十三度。
    火箭向月球飞行的轨道由两部分组成：加速飞行段——火箭在发动机推力的作用下，在这个飞行段到达一定的高空，并获得了必要的速度；自由飞行段——这个飞行段是在火箭最后一级发动机关车和容器脱离以后开始的。容器脱离最后一级火箭是用机械方法把它们分开的，并使容器具有不大的附加速度。
    根据天体力学的定理，火箭在发动机关车以后向月球自由飞行的轨道，有很长一段受月球的引力比较小，轨道的形状接近于双曲线，地球中心为双曲线的一个焦点。
    随着离地球越来越远，运行的速度逐渐降低到每秒两公里。后来由于月球引力逐渐增大的影响，速度不再降低，并开始增加，直到与月球表面相碰为止。同月球相碰时的速度达到每秒三点三公里。怎样保证在最有利条件
      下到达月球
    在向月球发射火箭之前，做了理论探讨和技术计算工作，从而决定了轨道参数和发射时间，保证了在最有利的条件下达到月球。现在来详细谈谈这一点。
    从原则上说，任何一天，不论月球在其绕地球运行轨道的任一位置上，发射火箭到月球上都是可能的。但是，经过计算证明，从辽阔的苏联境内的地面发射火箭时，从动力消耗上来说，发射火箭的最有利时刻是当月球处在它的轨道同最小赤纬的交叉点附近的时候，即月球赤纬接近十八度（负十八度）的时候。在这种情况下，火箭在加速段将以与地球表面成最小的角度飞行，而由于地球引力所损失的速度也将是最小，这就保证能够把最大的有效重物送上月球。火箭发射的日期迟一些或早一些，都会使可能的有效重物的重量减少。但是，如果相差只有几天，这种损失是比较小的。在每个月份内，都可以指出为期约一周的时距，在这一时距内火箭向月球的飞行是适合的。如果离这一最佳时期较远，可能的有效重物就要大大减小。
    在上述时距内，当火箭同月球相碰时，月球的位置应该在地平线之上。在宇宙火箭飞行中，火箭与月球相碰时间的选择应尽量使它们的相互接近发生在月球对于观测点来说处于上中天的时期，也就是月球离地平线的高度接近最大值的时期。在这种情况下无线电通讯的条件是最有利的。
    计算的结果，选择了轨道面同地球赤道面的最佳倾角值，这就为预定的发射点确定了火箭在它运行的开始阶段飞行轨道的方向。对于各种不同的航行方向，火箭在加速段运动速度的倾角和由地球引力所引起的损失大小，是各不相同的。选择航行的方向的条件是：损失最小，从而能最大限度地使可能的有效重物增加。同时，还考虑到便于安置成套的测量仪器的问题，这些仪器用来监督火箭的运行和收集火箭在加速段上和在最后一级发动机关车后自由飞行最初阶段上的遥测情报。
    计算表明，在从苏联境内向月球飞行的情况下，月球在火箭发射时应当位于地平线之下接近下中天的地方。这就是说，发射时刻应当同月球的上中天大约相差半昼夜。如果考虑到在到达月球时，月球应当位于上中天，那么，显然，向月球的飞行应当持续半昼夜，或者一个半昼夜，或者两个半昼夜，以此类推。
    宇宙火箭的持续飞行时间选定为一个半昼夜，因为飞行时间要是半昼夜，就要求十分巨大的初速度，而如果要在两个半昼夜或更多的时间内完成到达月球的飞行，并要在同月球相遇时对火箭进行有保证的观测，这就必须对保持加速段末端的运动参数的准确性提出更严格得多的要求。
    对飞行持续时间的选择决定了火箭在加速段末端的速度的大小。如上所述，这个速度略大于抛物线速度。
    计算火箭在加速段的轨道和最后一级发动机关车后运行阶段的轨道，都是用快速电子计算机进行的。在计算时曾考虑到地球和月球的引力。还必须考虑到由于地球的扁度而引起的地球的引力场偏离中心和对太阳引力的摄动作用。为了使火箭在加速段末端的飞行得到同计算数值十分准确地相符的运动参数，在火箭上装有在整个加速段都工作的操纵系统，整个加速段的时间为数分钟。火箭进一步持续的一个半昼夜的飞行是没有控制的，它完全是在地球、月球和其他天体的引力场的作用下飞行的。
      保证火箭准确运行任务十分复杂
    为了在火箭自由运行阶段不对它的运动进行任何校正的情况下能保证火箭到达月球，在加速段末端运动参数的计算值应当极为精确。例如，只要火箭的速度有每秒钟一米的误差，也就是等于火箭速度值的万分之一的误差，就会使它同月球的相碰点偏离二百五十公里。
    速度矢量同计算出的方向如果相差一分，相碰点就要偏离二百公里。发动机关车时火箭所在地点的座标的变动，也会大大影响火箭同月球表面相碰的位置。如果上述所有的误差以及火箭起飞时间的不准确这一切因素一起发生作用，通常使火箭同月球相碰点发生的偏差要比每个因素单独起作用时所发生的偏差为大。
    鉴于月球的半径为一千七百四十公里，要使火箭可靠地到达月球，速度的误差应该在每秒几米以内，而速度矢量和它预计的方向的偏差不应超过十分之一度。保证对火箭的操纵有这样的精确性，这是一件十分复杂的任务。
    应该指出，从苏联境内实现飞向月球的工作，对操纵系统工作的精确性的要求比从地球赤道附近地区起飞更为严格。
    精确地保持计算好的起飞时间的必要性同火箭轨道面随地球自转而发生转动有关系。起飞时间偏差十秒，同月球表面相碰点的偏差就达二百公里。
    使宇宙火箭在预定时间发射的精确度达到几秒以内，这是对发射火箭的组织工作和准备工作以及对自动发射系统提出的严格要求。苏联第二个宇宙火箭的发射的精确性证明了起动系统的完善和自动发射装置的高度可靠性。
    第二个宇宙火箭的起飞时间同预定发射时间相差约一秒。
    建立专门测量机构和计算机构，建立一套复杂的、可以有效地确定宇宙火箭飞行特征的设备的问题，在宇宙火箭飞行问题上非常重要。
    要求尽快地获得火箭飞行特征的资料，是一个特殊的要求，这种要求在很大程度上决定了整个测量系统的复杂性。这些资料对于观测站和测量站预报火箭的运行和火箭同月球表面相碰点的计算是必需的。
    从上面的数据可以看出，运行参数的误差对相碰点位置有多大的影响，根据测量数据确定这些参数时，应当使其精确度达到天文学计算的精确程度。
    多年来天文学实际工作所得出的确定宇宙体运行特征的一般办法，不可能运用于上述的目的。由于火箭这个观测目标的体积很小，而且在有限的观测时间内一些角度测量不够准确，此外，由于这些测量在很大程度上取决于能见度和地球大气层状态而很不可靠，所以观测天文学的基础，光学测量的确是不适用的。
    因此，宇宙火箭的测量机构是靠无线电技术测量工具来进行工作的。在这方面，利用了对倾斜距离、角度和径向速度的测定。
    对于这些特点和对确定宇宙火箭运动参数的要求，在整套自动化测定装置中都尽量充分加以考虑。这种装置可以十分精确地测定火箭运行中的倾斜距离和它的两个角度：方位角和位置角。从测量点获得的测量材料变换成二进位电码，进行初步整理和使其同天文时间配合。
    上述一切操作都是由专门的数字信息机进行的。这种信息机保证把测定材料用原材料形式或记忆信息形式自动送到各联系线。在计算中心，可以借助于专门的电子设备把接收到的情报自动译出并打成穿孔卡片，以后穿孔卡便送入电子计算机中。计算机根据来自各测量点的测定材料，对火箭运行的起始条件、目标指示和火箭同月球相碰点的座标进行计算。
    为了获得宇宙火箭在它到达月球的整个飞行阶段中运动的完整的资料，不间断地测量火箭离地球的距离、火箭运动的径向速度（即其离开测量点的速度）和角度座标：位置角和方位角。测量是以一八三点六兆周的频率进行的。
    地面上的遥测站传递和记录了宇宙火箭上所进行的科学观测的资料以及关于测量仪器和无线电仪器工作条件（温度和压力）的资料。科学资料是用频率各为一八三点六、三九点九八六和一九点九九三兆周的无线电发射机发送的。全部上述无线电技术设备都装在容器之内。
    用两个频率——一九点九九七兆周和二○点○○三兆周工作的发射机对最后一级火箭的飞行进行无线电观测，并沿这个无线电波道发回关于宇宙辐射强度的补充科学情报，这不是从装设在容器上的仪器发回的，而是从最后一级火箭上的仪器发回的。
      地面上准确测定了相碰地点和时间
    设在苏联各地的专门测量点的大批成套无线电技术仪器都参加了对苏联第二个宇宙火箭的观测。所有的测量点联合成了一个专门联系系统，这个系统保证了有效地把观测资料传发到计算中心，把目标指示传发到各测量点。
    为了使测量仪器工作在时间上协调，并使测量结果配合统一的时间，组织了统一时间的专门机构。
    苏联的各个测量点通过自动联系线路在二十到三十分钟内就把测量资料发到了计算中心，对测量资料的初步整理使得在宇宙火箭飞行的第一个小时内计算出火箭继续运行的轨道，证实火箭可以十分准确地到达月球，为苏联和外国测量站进一步测量和观测计算出指示目标。
    根据这些资料可以确定，预期的相碰点是在月球可见圆面的北部。
    后来对这些资料进行了精确的研究，并且参考了关于火箭距离和径向速度的大量补充材料，就有了可能确定火箭和月球相碰的地点和时间。已经确定，相碰点位于“澄海”区距月球可见圆面中心八百公里之处。
    第二个苏联宇宙火箭顺利地飞到月球是研究宇宙空间和天体的极重要的阶段。
