    Drive Must Be "Sufficient"
  　Hebei Jiahe　Xu Jiacheng
    I couldn't sleep all night yesterday. The words of the Party Central Committee's plenum document kept churning in my heart.

    The words in the document, every sentence is in line with the wishes of us farmers. I feel that this sentence: "For those tasks that could have been completed based on objective conditions and subjective efforts, but were not completed by making every possible effort" moves me the most. This kind of thing happens a lot. When we see that the crops are growing well, we say that it won't make much difference to manage them further, let's "settle for what we have"! Even if it doesn't make a big difference, it still makes a small difference. Why not go all out and increase production by even one jin if possible, and dig out that "small difference"? When we see that the crops have suffered a disaster, we say: "It won't be of much use to manage them further," and we get discouraged. Even if it's not of much use, it still has "small use." Why not go all out and manage the disaster-stricken seedlings well, and harvest even one jin if possible, and dig out that "small use"? We know very well that the crops still have more than a month of growth ahead of them, and summer-sown crops are at the critical moment, and there is still great potential. Beans can increase their pods, corn can increase its kernels, cotton can increase its bolls, sweet potatoes can increase their tubers, and sorghum can increase its panicles. We can also make beans grow larger pods, corn grow bigger kernels, cotton grow bigger bolls, sweet potatoes grow bigger tubers, and sorghum open its eyes wider. If this "five increases" and "five bigs" are realized, it's a small matter for each plant to produce an extra half a tael of grain. Each mu will yield fifty or so more jin, and our whole country will harvest so much more grain!

    From these things, we can see that the General Line is truly a treasure. The first sentence of the General Line is: "Go all out," which means that just having some drive is not enough. The drive must be "sufficient." If it is not sufficient, we cannot achieve a production leap forward and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. To give an analogy, a ball with insufficient air cannot bounce up. If thinking is right-leaning, the drive will be insufficient, and we will harvest less grain.

### 干劲要“足”

    干劲要“足”
  　河北交河　徐家常
    昨天我一夜没睡着觉，党中央全会文件里的话老是翻腾着我的心。
    文件里的话，句句合咱农民的意，我觉得这句话：“对于那些根据客观条件和主观努力本来可以完成的任务，不去千方百计地努力完成”最使我心动，这种事是很多的。看到庄稼长的好啦，就说再管也没大出息了，“定局”吧！没大出息还有小出息，为什么不鼓足干劲能增产一斤是一斤，把“小出息”也挖出来呢？见到庄稼受灾就说：“再管也中不了大用”，泄气了，中不了大用还有“小用”，为什么不鼓足干劲，管好受灾苗，能收一斤是一斤，把“小用”挖出来呢？咱们明知道庄稼还有一个多月的长头，夏播作物正在要劲的时候，还有很大的潜力。豆子可以增角，玉米可以增粒，棉花可以增桃，山芋可以增块，多穗高粮可以增穗，还可以豆子长大角，玉米壮大粒，棉花结大桃，山芋长大块，高粮瞪大眼。这“五增”“五大”要是实现了，一棵庄稼多闹半两粮食是小意思，一亩就多收五十来斤，咱全国得多收多少粮食！
    从这些事里，我们看出总路线真是宝，总路线的头一句是：“鼓足干劲”，就是说，光有点干劲不行，干劲必须要“足”了，不足了，就不能实现生产跃进，多快好省地建设社会主义，打个比方，皮球气不足就跳不起来，思想右倾，干劲就不足，就少打粮食。
