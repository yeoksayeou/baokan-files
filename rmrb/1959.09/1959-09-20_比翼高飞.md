Soaring together is the characteristic of the national economic development of various countries in the socialist camp after the war, especially in the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The high-speed development of the national economy is a universal law of the socialist economy. When there was only one socialist country, the Soviet Union, it set up an opposition to the capitalist countries' turbulent and crisis-ridden economy with its planned and high-speed development economy. In the eleven years before the war (1930-1940), the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union increased by an average of 16.5% per year, while the United States only increased by 1.2%, and the United Kingdom only increased by 2.1%. France actually decreased by 2.2%. This has initially shown the advantages and disadvantages of the two systems, which shocked the capitalist world. After the war, a series of socialist countries appeared on the horizon of Europe and Asia, and they and the Soviet Union constituted a magnificent socialist camp. The socialist countries quickly healed the wounds of war and vigorously carried out peaceful construction. The law of high-speed development shines like sunlight on the land of socialist countries. The industrial production of socialist countries not only develops at a high speed of 10% to 15% or even 20% to 30% on average every year (see table), but also increases year by year, soaring upwards. It is worth pointing out that the Soviet Union's production volume now ranks second in the world, and the absolute amount contained in each 1% increase in its industrial production is the highest in the socialist camp. For example, each 1% increase in steel production is equivalent to an increase of 550,000 tons. In the past five years (1954-1958), the industrial production of the entire socialist camp increased by an average of 11% per year, while the capitalist world only increased by 3%. The economic development of capitalist countries is not only relatively slow, but also extremely unbalanced and fluctuating, thus forming a curve-like crawling posture. West Germany, France, and Japan, whose economic foundation was greatly damaged in the war, had a relatively high rate of industrial production growth after the war, but in 1958 it also began to slow down and decrease, while the growth rate of the United States and the United Kingdom has been relatively low. The British economy has been almost stagnant in the past three years. The United States, Canada, and Japan have experienced three economic crises after the war. The industrial production of the United States in 1949, 1954, and 1958 decreased by 6.73%, 6.72%, and 6.52% respectively compared with the previous year.

Not only has the Soviet Union, which has completed socialist construction, has a high-speed development of its national economy, but other socialist countries with different historical conditions, regardless of whether their original economies were developed or backward, have all made rapid progress without exception. In Europe, when Czechoslovakia was still in the capitalist era, between the two world wars, although its industry was very developed, its industrial output only increased by an average of 1%-2% per year, while after the establishment of the socialist system, it increased by an average of 10%-12% per year. Romania used to be an economically backward country ruled by the bourgeoisie and landlords. It only established its own industry after liberation. From 1948 to 1957, its industrial output increased by an average of 17.3% per year. In Asia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea almost rebuilt its home on the ruins left by the war. From 1953 to 1958, its industrial production increased by an average of 42.46% per year. China, with its large population and vast land, and its "poor and blank" economic foundation, saw its total industrial output value (including handicrafts) increase by an average of 18% per year during the first five-year plan, and by 66% in the great leap forward of 1958.

The socialist camp countries, united in friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation, are soaring together. This kind of soaring together is unimaginable in capitalist countries, because in the capitalist world there is only fierce competition and exclusion, only the bullying and oppression of economically less developed countries by a few so-called "advanced" countries. This kind of soaring together makes the imperialists very distressed, because anyone with basic mathematical knowledge knows that in the economic competition between the two systems, the final victory must belong to the side that runs ahead at a higher speed; the greater the difference in speed between the two sides, the earlier the moment of victory or defeat will arrive.

In the economic competition between the two systems, the capitalist countries that crawl in a curve will be left behind by the socialist countries that soar together. This is an irresistible trend. The people of our socialist camp countries have always participated in this competition with full confidence in victory, striving to catch up with and surpass the developed capitalist countries as soon as possible. The socialist countries' attitude of defending peace and opposing war is consistently firm, because in peaceful competition, we will be able to defeat imperialism. On the contrary, the imperialist countries headed by the United States are always in a dark mood, low in spirit, and wavering in attitude towards this inescapable peaceful competition. They are not only deeply worried about the final defeat of the capitalist system after the competition, but also uneasy about the increasingly expanding influence of the socialist system during the competition. Therefore, American imperialism has long refused to change its policy of cold war and creating international tension. It attempts to hinder the progress of socialist countries' construction, to belittle the huge impact that this large-scale peaceful construction and its leap forward speed are having on the people in the capitalist world, by threatening the peace of the world or a certain region, by establishing a network of military bases surrounding socialist countries, by economic boycott and blockade against socialist countries, and by spreading rumors and slanders and sabotage activities against socialist countries. However, the historical wheel of the high-speed progress of socialist countries cannot be stopped, and the influence of the young socialist system being superior to the decadent capitalist system cannot be weakened.

The Soviet Union has already surpassed Britain, Germany, and France in economic development before the war, and is now entering the decisive stage of "catching up with the United States." The Soviet people are working hard with vigorous labor enthusiasm to complete the magnificent seven-year plan ahead of schedule, and striving to complete the economic tasks of the recent period put forward by the party before 1970, that is, not only to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist country, the United States, in terms of total industrial and agricultural output value, but also to catch up with and surpass it in terms of output value per capita. The difference in the economic development speed between the Soviet Union and the United States predicts that the Soviet Union will surely win this peaceful competition. In the past forty years (1917-1957), the average annual growth rate of Soviet industrial output was 10%, of which heavy industry was 11.4%, while the United States was 3.2%; if we do not count the war years and the period of economic recovery, in the eleven years before the war (1930-1940) and the eleven years after the war (1947-1957), the Soviet speed was 16.2%, and the American speed was 2.9%. In 1958, the Soviet Union increased by 10%, while the United States decreased by 6.5% due to the economic crisis. Taking steel as an example, it will only take the Soviet Union seven years (1959-1965) to increase its steel output from about 55 million tons to about 90 million tons; while the United States needed thirty-four years (1917-1951). It is this different speed that is narrowing the gap in industrial production between the Soviet Union and the United States. In 1913, the industrial production level of Tsarist Russia was less than one-fourteenth of that of the United States, while in 1937 the industrial output of the Soviet Union reached one-fifth of that of the United States, in 1953 it reached one-third of that of the United States, and in 1957 it reached more than one-half of that of the United States. Bourgeois economists once comforted themselves by saying that the United States' industrial and agricultural production volume was much larger than that of the Soviet Union. They believed that although the Soviet Union's production speed exceeded that of the United States, the United States' absolute increase in output would still be higher than that of the Soviet Union. This self-comfort gradually lost its basis. In recent years, the Soviet Union has caught up with and surpassed the United States in terms of the absolute increase in output of a series of major products such as steel, pig iron, iron ore, coal, oil, cement, and woolen fabrics. Now the Soviet Union's industrial output is equal to more than half of that of the United States, and its agricultural output is equal to more than three-quarters of that of the United States, while the Soviet Union's seven-year plan stipulates that industrial output will increase by 80% and agricultural output will increase by 70%. Therefore, when the Soviet Union completes the seven-year plan, the absolute output of some of its most important industrial products will exceed the current industrial production level of the United States, while the output of other products will be close to the current level of the United States; the total output and per capita output of its most important agricultural products will exceed the current level of the United States. Under peaceful conditions, the average annual growth rate of Soviet industry is 2.5 times higher than that of the fastest period of American industrial development. What's more, the Soviet people are launching a competition to complete the seven-year plan in six or even five years, and are reforming technology through the movement of complete mechanization and automation of the production process, while the capitalist economic laws make the United States inevitably re-experience economic stagnation and crisis. Therefore, in the next ten years or so, the Soviet economy will achieve a victory over the American economy, which can be expected. The Soviet "Red Star" newspaper predicted on December 2 last year that with the 1958 Soviet industrial output as 100 and the United States as 180, by 1968, the Soviet Union will reach 230 and the United States will be 220; by 1970, the Soviet Union will reach 270 and the United States will be 230. It is precisely the high-speed development of the Soviet national economy and the increasingly obvious prospects predicted by this high speed that make the American ruling class anxious. American Senator Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, published an article in the Paris "Express" in May this year, helplessly admitting that the Soviet Union will inevitably surpass the United States economically. He said: "No matter whether this situation will occur in 1970 or later, it is certain that if the two countries continue to maintain the current rate of production development, we will definitely be surpassed. Economic development, although not as eye-catching as artificial satellites or rockets, is even more disturbing."

When the Soviet people took on the glorious task of "catching up with the United States," the Chinese people also began the great undertaking of "catching up with Britain." Old China left the people with a very backward economy. After three years of economic recovery and the completion of the first five-year plan, the Chinese economy has made great progress; for example, in 1957, China's steel and coal output reached 24.3% and 57.2% of Britain's output respectively. On this basis, the slogan of "catching up with the British level in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years" was put forward. In 1958, the Chinese people, inspired by the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, launched a great leap forward in industry and agriculture and a movement of people's communes. Due to the great leap forward, the targets of raw coal, timber, crude salt, and grain in the second five-year plan were completed four years ahead of schedule. Coal production surged from 130 million tons to 270 million tons, surpassing Britain in one fell swoop. The Chinese people, who are in a situation of continued leap forward, are now warmly responding to the call of the party and the state, boosting their energy, opposing right-leaning tendencies, and striving to complete or approach the completion of the second five-year plan in the next three years in terms of major industrial and agricultural production indicators such as steel and cotton. In this way, it is possible for China to leap forward in the next three years to a much higher level in industrial and agricultural production than originally planned to be achieved in 1962, so that the slogan of "catching up with the British level in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years" can be basically completed in about ten years, and the twelve-year agricultural development program originally planned to be realized in 1967 can be strived to be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded by a large margin. Judging from the speed of industrial and agricultural development in ten years, this is completely guaranteed. During the first five-year plan from 1953 to 1957, China's industrial production increased by an average of 18% per year, while Britain only increased by 4.1%; in 1958, China increased by 66% again, while Britain decreased by 0.9%. Taking steel as an example, from 1950 to 1958, China's steel output increased by an average of 54.7% per year, while Britain only increased by 2.6%; in 1958 alone, China's steel output increased by 107% (of which foreign steel increased by 49.5%), while Britain decreased by 9.8%. The Chinese people are striving to increase steel production by another 50% in 1959. In this way, China only used ten years (1949-1959) to increase steel production from about 600,000 tons to about 12 million tons, while Britain used 67 years (1869-1936), Japan used 47 years (1910-1957), and the United States used 29 years (1872-1901). Taking grain as an example, from 1949 to 1958, China's total grain output increased by 1.31 times, an average annual increase of 9.75% in nine years, an increase of 35% in 1958, and another 10% in 1959; while the United States only increased by an average of 2.34% per year, Japan only increased by 2.02%, and Britain decreased by 12.7% in these nine years. China is leaping forward again and again at such a high speed, so it can greatly shorten the time to catch up with Britain. The American and British bourgeois propaganda machines have wantonly spread rumors of China's leap forward being a "miserable failure," but the economic development speed of China, which has suffered a "miserable failure," still far exceeds that of the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries.

The economies of other socialist countries are also developing rapidly. Czechoslovakia has exceeded capitalist countries in terms of the output of many major industrial products per capita. For example, its steel output has exceeded that of Sweden and France, and its power generation has exceeded that of France and Italy. The Czechoslovak people are striving to increase industrial production by 90%-95% and agricultural production by about 40% by the completion of the third five-year plan in 1965; by that time, they will exceed the current level of the United States in terms of the output and consumption of major industrial products per capita. The Polish 1959-1965 plan stipulates that by 1965, industrial output will increase by about 80% and agricultural output will increase by about 30% compared with 1958; by that time, it will exceed Italy in terms of the output of the most important industrial products per capita, and catch up with and exceed the current level of France. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which has mounted the Chollima, has completed the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, and will catch up with Japan this year in terms of the output of important industrial products such as electricity, coal, pig iron, cement, and chemical fertilizers per capita. The output of products such as grain, animal fats, white sugar, flour, cameras, bicycles, and motorcycles in the German Democratic Republic has exceeded that of West Germany per capita. It is striving to exceed West Germany in terms of the consumption of all important food and consumer goods per capita by 1961. Hungary has proposed to complete the three-year plan one year ahead of schedule this year. The Bulgarian plan stipulates that industrial production in 1965 will increase by two to three times compared with 1957. Romania's total industrial output value will increase by 60%-65% in the second five-year plan (1956-1960). Albania's total industrial and agricultural output value will increase by 197% in the second five-year plan (1956-1960). The Democratic Republic of Vietnam's total industrial and agricultural output value will increase by 78% in the three-year plan (1958-1960). Mongolia plans to increase its total industrial output value to 2.4 times that of 1957 by 1965.

The situation of the national economies of all countries in the entire socialist camp soaring together and the great international impact of this situation make the imperialists and their lackeys dumbfounded. Therefore, they grasp at shadows and attempt to weaken this impact with vicious rumors and slanders. However, the more vicious these rumors and slanders are, the more significant the international significance of the high-speed development, leap forward, and soaring together of socialist countries becomes, and the more helpless the slanderers are to the superiority of the socialist system. American Deputy Secretary of State Dillon said in a speech at Harvard University on June 11 this year: "It cannot be denied that the Soviet Union's current economic development is faster than that of the United States." He worried that "if international communism successfully portrays the Soviet system as a magical method capable of achieving rapid progress, then international communism will be able to have a huge impact on those who yearn to elevate their people to the 20th century level." Over the past year, international reactionaries have been equally terrified and attacked China's great leap forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959. However, reality cannot be denied. The British "Reynolds News" published an article by Joseph on August 30, in which the author confirmed: "Most of the important targets of the second five-year plan will be reached greatly ahead of schedule this year, which means that China still has a good chance to realize the slogan of 'catching up with Britain in the output of industrial products in fifteen years' in ten years. The cold reality is that China is still far ahead in terms of grain production and industrial development."

In order to belittle the international impact of the high-speed economic development of socialist countries, bourgeois economists also attempt to use the so-called "law of diminishing returns to production" to explain that socialist countries cannot always maintain high speed, but will, like capitalist countries, reduce their speed year by year as the level of economic development increases. They observe the issue of speed abstractly, leaving aside the vastly different social conditions of socialism and capitalism. Therefore, they cannot see the great possibilities of continuous improvement of productivity and continuous improvement of production relations under the socialist system. They cannot see the great role played by the improvement of people's political consciousness, the exuberance of production enthusiasm, the exertion of labor wisdom, the progress of technology, and the rational distribution of productive forces in improving labor productivity. How can there be such selfless labor spirit and soaring enthusiasm among workers in countries where labor is regarded as a commodity as in the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries? In countries where monopoly capital is dominant, how can technological innovation be allowed to prevail unhindered? However, in socialist countries, these are achievable and bound to be achieved. This is why the Soviet Union's economic base has expanded many times over the past forty years (for example, the steel produced in one month now is more than that produced in the entire year of 1913), but still maintains a high speed of average annual industrial production growth of about 10%. This is why the total agricultural output value of the Soviet Union only increased by a total of 10% in so many years from 1940 to 1952, and the average annual growth rate from 1950 to 1953 was only 1.6%, while in 1954-1957, due to the improvement of leadership over agriculture, the increased enthusiasm of collective farmers for increasing production, the increased agricultural investment, and the reclamation of large areas of wasteland, the average annual growth rate rose to 7.1%, and will rise to 8% during the seven-year plan. This is why the development speed of China's industry and agriculture and other sectors of the national economy in 1958 and 1959, due to the great leap forward and continued leap forward, is much higher than in any previous year.

There is no secret recipe for the consistently high-speed development of the economies of socialist countries, but capitalist countries cannot learn it, because high-speed development is an inherent economic law of the socialist system. The public ownership of the means of production and the planned development of the economy fully unleash the vitality of social productive forces that have been liberated from the shackles of the capitalist economy. Due to the superiority of the socialist system, socialist countries have surpassed capitalist countries in the growth rate of labor productivity, and this is the most important condition for ensuring the victory of the new society, because the faster labor productivity grows, the faster socialist countries will catch up with and surpass capitalist countries in terms of industrial and agricultural output per capita. In recent years, the growth rate of labor productivity in socialist countries has been about twice as fast as that of capitalist countries, of which the Soviet Union is several times faster than the United States. The growth rate of labor productivity is determined by the social status of the workers and the technical equipment of the workers, which are the two factors of productive force development: human factor and material factor. In socialist countries, the working people are not slaves but masters. Their labor can not only continuously improve their living standards, but also prepare the necessary material foundation for the realization of the highest ideal of mankind - communism. Therefore, their enthusiasm is overflowing, their energy is soaring, and they have created and are creating miracles that are unimaginable under the capitalist system; for example, the Soviet Union reclaimed 35.9 million hectares of wasteland in 1954-1956; in addition to the eighteen large-scale steel enterprises, China built small blast furnaces with a volume of more than 40,000 cubic meters in less than a year, which can now produce 10 million tons of pig iron annually, and small converters that can produce 4 million tons of steel annually and 7 million tons of steel annually after reaching the design capacity. This is on the one hand. On the other hand, the invention and application of advanced technology in socialist countries is much faster and more widespread than in capitalist countries, because socialist countries train more scientific and technological personnel, provide scientific and technological personnel with an environment where they can fully develop their talents, and make scientific and technological inventions and creations the wealth of the whole people, free from the monopoly and blockade of capitalists. Therefore, the Soviet Union is far ahead of the United States in space rockets, atomic energy, and many other cutting-edge scientific and technological fields. Eisenhower sought to catch up with the Soviet Union in those scientific and technological fields where the Soviet Union was leading, but so far only one Soviet artificial earth satellite and artificial cosmic planet that is larger than the other have been launched into the sky, and only the Soviet cosmic rocket has accurately hit the moon. The American ruling group can only sigh at the sky. The construction experience of socialist countries proves that the greater the labor enthusiasm of the masses of the people and the enthusiasm for adopting advanced technology, the higher the labor productivity, and the more guaranteed the high-speed development of production. Although international reactionaries slander the selfless labor and soaring enthusiasm of the people of socialist countries as "enslavement" and "forced labor," and although they curse the high-speed economic development and leap forward of socialist countries as a fleeting phenomenon or something full of crises, the economy of the Soviet Union for decades and the economies of other socialist countries for more than ten years have been soaring and flourishing, and the people of socialist countries have been building a free and happy life with high morale and high spirits. It is precisely: although the mad dog barks wildly on the side, the steed still gallops forward.

The result of the high-speed development of the national economies of the countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is not only rapidly changing the face of socialist countries, but also causing huge changes in the economic comparison between the world socialist system and the capitalist system. Now, the countries of the socialist camp account for 35% of the world's population, while their industrial output accounts for more than one-third of the world's total industrial output, grain accounts for nearly half, and cotton accounts for 43%. The world socialist system has exceeded the capitalist system in terms of industrial output per capita. Seven years later, due to the completion and over-completion of the national economic plans of the socialist countries that are soaring together, the industrial output of the socialist system will account for more than half of the world's total industrial output, and the proportion of grain and cotton will also increase. Therefore, the next ten years or so will be a decisive period, during which the socialist system will achieve a victory over the capitalist system in the field of material production, and this victory is the most reliable guarantee for world lasting peace and human progress.

    比翼高飞
    李何
    比翼高飞，这是战后特别是中华人民共和国成立十年来社会主义阵营各国国民经济发展的特点。
    国民经济的高速度发展，是社会主义经济的普遍规律。当世界上还只有一个社会主义国家苏联的时候，它就从有计划、高速度发展的经济，与资本主义国家的动荡不安、危机四伏的经济树立了对立面。在战前十一年（1930—1940）中，苏联工业总产值每年平均增长16.5％，而美国仅增长1.2％，英国仅增长2.1％，法国反而下降2.2％。这已经初次显出了两个制度的优劣，使资本主义世界大吃一惊。到了战后，一系列社会主义国家在欧亚两洲的地平线出现了，它们和苏联一起构成了雄伟的社会主义阵营。社会主义各国迅速地治愈了战争创伤，蓬勃地进行着和平建设。高速度发展规律像阳光一样普照社会主义各国的大地。社会主义各国的工业生产不仅都以平均每年增长10％到15％甚至20％、30％的高速度发展（见表），而且都是逐年递增，扶摇直上的。值得指出的，现在苏联的生产量已经占世界第二位，它的工业生产每增长1％所包含的绝对量之大，为社会主义阵营之冠，如钢产量每增长1％就等于增加五十五万吨。最近五年（1954—1958）中，整个社会主义阵营的工业生产平均每年增长11％，而资本主义世界只增长3％。资本主义各国的经济发展，不仅是比较缓慢的，而且是极不平衡的和起落不定的，因此形成了曲线式爬行的姿态。在战争中经济基础破坏较大的西德、法国、日本，在战后工业生产增长的速度比较高，但在1958年也开始减缓和降低，而美国、英国增长的速度一直比较低。英国经济在最近三年几乎处于停顿状态。美国、加拿大、日本在战后已经经历三次经济危机，美国的工业生产在1949、1954、1958年分别比上一年降低了6.73％、6.72％、6.52％。

    （注一）1953—1958年的平均每年增长率
    （注二）1955—1958年的平均每年增长率
    不单完成了社会主义建设的苏联，它的国民经济的发展是高速度的，而且历史条件各不相同的其他社会主义国家，不论它们的原来经济是发达的还是落后的，都毫无例外地飞跃前进。在欧洲，当捷克斯洛伐克还处在资本主义时代，在两次世界大战之间，尽管它的工业很发达，但它的工业产量平均每年增长不过1％—2％，而在社会主义制度建立以后，平均每年增长10％—12％。罗马尼亚曾经是资产阶级和地主统治的经济落后的国家，在解放以后才建立了本国的工业，在1948—1957年中，它的工业产量平均每年增长17.3％。在亚洲，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国几乎是在战争留下的废墟上重建家园，在1953—1958年中，它的工业生产平均每年增长42.46％。人多地广而又“一穷二白”的中国，在第一个五年计划期间工业总产值（包括手工业）平均每年增长18％，在大跃进的1958年增长66％。
    友好团结、互助合作的社会主义阵营各国在比翼高飞。这种比翼高飞在资本主义国家是不可想像的，因为在资本主义世界里只有剧烈的竞争和排挤，只有几个所谓“先进”国对经济比较不发达的国家的欺凌和压迫。这种比翼高飞，使帝国主义大伤脑筋，因为具有起码数学常识的人都知道：在两个体系所进行的经济竞赛中，最后胜利一定属于以更高速度跑在前面的一方；双方速度的差别越大，胜负的时刻就越早到来。
    在两个体系的经济竞赛中，曲线式爬行的资本主义国家，将被比翼高飞的社会主义国家抛到后面，这是不可阻挡的趋势。我们社会主义阵营各国的人民向来满怀胜利的信心，参加这场竞赛，力争早日赶上和超过发达的资本主义国家。社会主义国家保卫和平、反对战争的态度是一贯坚决的，因为在和平比赛中，我们就能够比垮帝国主义。相反的，以美国为首的帝国主义国家对这一场摆脱不开的和平竞赛，总是心境暗淡、情绪低落、态度动摇的。他们不仅对于在竞赛后资本主义制度终将败北的结局忧虑重重，而且对于在竞赛过程中社会主义制度的影响更加扩大的情景坐卧不安。所以美帝国主义长期不肯改变冷战和制造国际紧张局势的政策。它妄图以对世界或某一地区的和平的威胁，以建立包围社会主义国家的军事基地网，以对社会主义国家的经济抵制和封锁，以对社会主义国家的造谣污蔑和破坏活动，来阻碍社会主义各国建设的进展，来贬低这种大规模和平建设及其跃进的速度在资本主义世界的人民中正在发生的巨大影响。然而，社会主义国家高速度前进的历史车轮是阻挡不住的，年青的社会主义制度优越于腐朽的资本主义制度的影响是削弱不了的。
    苏联在经济发展上早已在战前就超过英国、德国、法国，现在进入了“赶美国”的决定性阶段。苏联人民正以旺盛的劳动热情争取提前完成宏伟的七年计划，争取在1970年以前完成党所提出的最近时期的经济任务，这就是：不仅要在工农业总产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家美国，而且要在按人口平均计算的产量方面也赶上和超过它。苏美两国经济发展速度的差别预示：在这场和平竞赛中，苏联必定取得胜利。在过去四十年（1917—1957）中，苏联工业产量平均每年增长速度为10％，其中大工业为11.4％，而美国为3.2％；如果不算战争年份和恢复经济时期，在战前十一年（1930—1940）和战后十一年（1947—1957）中，苏联速度为16.2％，美国速度为2.9％。1958年苏联增长了10％，而美国由于经济危机下降了6.5％。以钢为例，苏联把钢产量从五千五百万吨左右提高到九千万吨左右，将只需要七年（1959—1965）；而美国曾需要三十四年（1917—1951）。正是这种高低不同的速度越来越缩小着苏美两国在工业生产上的差距。在1913年沙皇俄国的工业生产水平不及美国的十四分之一，而到1937年苏联的工业产量达到美国的五分之一，1953年达到美国的三分之一，1957年达到美国的二分之一以上。资产阶级经济学家曾经以美国工农业生产量比苏联大得多而自慰，他们认为虽然苏联的生产速度超过美国，但是美国绝对增产量仍将高于苏联。这种自慰逐渐地失去了根据。苏联最近几年在钢、生铁、铁矿砂、煤、石油、水泥、毛织品等一系列主要产品的绝对增产量方面赶上和超过了美国。现在苏联的工业产量等于美国的一半以上，农业产量等于美国的四分之三以上，而苏联七年计划规定工业产量将提高80％，农业产量将提高70％。因此，苏联在完成七年计划的时候，它的工业的某些最主要产品的绝对产量将超过美国现在的工业生产水平，而其他某些产品的产量将接近于美国现在的水平；它的最重要的农产品的总产量和按人口平均计算的产量，都将超过美国现在的水平。在和平条件下苏联工业平均每年增长速度比美国工业发展最快时期也高二点五倍。何况苏联人民正在展开在六年甚至五年内完成七年计划的竞赛，正在通过生产过程全盘机械化和自动化运动来革新技术，而资本主义经济规律使美国不可避免地将再次发生经济上的停滞和危机。因此在今后十年左右，苏联经济将取得压倒美国经济的胜利，这是可以拭目以待的。去年12月2日苏联“红星报”预计：以1958年苏联工业产量为一百，美国为一百八十，到1968年时，苏联将达到二百三十，美国将为二百二十；到1970年时，苏联将达到二百七十，美国将为二百三十。正是苏联国民经济高速度发展和这种高速度所预卜的日益明显的前景，使美国统治阶级焦灼不安。美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特今年5月在巴黎“快报”上发表一篇文章，无可奈何地承认苏联必然将在经济上超过美国，他说：“不管这个情况将发生在1970年或是再晚一些，肯定的是：假如两国继续保持目前的生产发展速度，我们一定被超过。经济发展虽然不像人造卫星或者火箭那样引人注目，它却更令人感到不安。”
    当苏联人民挑起“赶美国”的光荣任务的时候，中国人民也开始了“赶英国”的壮举。旧中国留给人民非常落后的经济。经过三年经济恢复和第一个五年计划的完成，中国经济有了巨大的发展；例如，在1957年中国的钢和煤的产量分别达到英国的产量的24.3％和57.2％。在这个基础上提出了“十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平”的口号。1958年中国人民在共产党所提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，掀起了一个工农业大跃进和人民公社化的运动。由于大跃进，提前四年完成了第二个五年计划中的原煤、原木、原盐、粮食的指标。煤产量由一亿三千万吨激增到二亿七千万吨，一举而超过了英国。处在继续跃进的形势中的中国人民，现在热烈响应党和国家的号召，鼓干劲，反右倾，争取在钢、棉等主要工农业生产指标方面提前三年完成或接近完成第二个五年计划。这样，中国就有可能在今后三年内使工农业生产跃进到比原定在1962年达到的更高得多的水平，从而使“十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平”的口号，可以争取在十年左右的时间内基本完成，并且使原定在1967年实现的十二年农业发展纲要可以争取大大提前超额完成。从十年工农业发展的速度看来，这是完全有把握的。中国在1953—1957年第一个五年计划期间工业生产平均每年增长18％，而英国只增长4.1％；1958年中国又增长了66％，而英国下降了0.9％。拿钢来说，在1950—1958年间，中国的钢产量平均每年增长54.7％，而英国才增长2.6％；在1958年这一年中国的钢产量增长了107％（其中洋钢增长49.5％），而英国下降了9.8％。中国人民争取在1959年内把钢的产量再提高50％。这样，中国把钢产量从六十万吨左右提高到一千二百万吨左右只用十年（1949—1959），而英国用了六十七年（1869—1936），日本用了四十七年（1910—1957），美国用了二十九年（1872—1901）。拿粮食来说，从1949到1958年，中国的粮食总产量增长一点三一倍，九年中平均每年增长9.75％，在1958年增长了35％，在1959年将再增长10％；而美国平均每年只增长2.34％，日本只增长2.02％，英国在这九年中还下降12.7％。中国以这样高的速度跃进再跃进，所以能够大大缩短赶上英国的时间。美英资产阶级宣传机器大肆散布所谓中国跃进“惨败”的谣言，然而“惨败”的中国的经济发展速度仍然远远赶过美英及其他资本主义国家。
    其他社会主义国家的经济也都在飞速地发展。捷克斯洛伐克有许多主要工业品产量，按人口平均计算，已经超过资本主义国家，如钢的产量超过了瑞典、法国，发电量超过了法国和意大利。捷克斯洛伐克人民争取到1965年第三个五年计划完成时，工业生产要比1957年增加90％—95％，农业生产要增加约40％；到那时在主要工业产品按人口平均计算的产量和消费量方面都将超过美国现在的水平。波兰1959——1965年计划规定，到1965年工业产量将比1958年增长约80％，农业增长约30％；到那时在最重要的工业产品按人口平均计算的产量方面，将超过意大利、赶上和超过法国现在的水平。跨上千里马的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划，将于今年在电力、煤、生铁、水泥、化学肥料等重要工业品按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上日本。德意志民主共和国的粮食、动物油脂、白糖、面粉、照相机、自行车、摩托车等产品，按人口平均计算，已经超过西德，它争取到1961年，在所有重要的食品和消费品的消费量方面，按人口平均计算，都超过西德。匈牙利提出要在今年提前一年完成三年计划。保加利亚的计划规定，1965年工业生产将比1957年增加二倍至三倍。罗马尼亚在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）中工业总产值将增长60％—65％。阿尔巴尼亚在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）中工农业总产值将增长197％。越南民主共和国在三年计划（1958—1960年）中工农业总产值将增长78％。蒙古计划到1965年时工业总产值将为1957年的二点四倍。
    整个社会主义阵营各国比翼高飞的形势和这种形势在国际上的巨大影响，使帝国主义者及其走卒瞠目咋舌。因此他们捕风捉影，用恶毒的谣言和污蔑，企图削弱这种影响。然而，这些谣言和污蔑越恶毒，就越显得社会主义国家高速度发展、跃进、比翼高飞的国际意义之重大，就越显得造谣污蔑分子对社会主义制度优越性无可奈何。美国副国务卿狄龙今年6月11日在哈佛大学讲话时说：“不能否认苏联现在的经济发展快于美国”，他担心“如果国际共产主义成功地把苏维埃制度描绘成一种能够达到迅速进步的神奇方法，那么，国际共产主义将能对那些渴望使自己的人民上升到二十世纪水平的人产生巨大的影响”。一年来，国际反动分子同样胆战心惊地攻击中国在1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进。然而现实是抹煞不了的。英国“雷诺新闻”8月30日刊载了约瑟写的一篇文章，作者确认：“第二个五年计划的重要指标大多数将在今年大大提前达到，这就意味着中国仍然大有希望在十年内实现‘在十五年内在工业产品产量方面赶上英国’的口号。冷酷的现实是：在粮食生产以及在工业发展方面，中国仍然遥遥领先。”
    为了贬低社会主义国家的经济高速度发展所发生的国际影响，资产阶级经济学家还企图用所谓“生产效率递减规律”来说明社会主义国家不能经常保持高速度，而会和资本主义国家一样，随着经济发展的水平的提高，速度一年年降低。他们离开社会主义与资本主义迥然不同的社会条件抽象地观察速度问题，因此他们看不到在社会主义制度下生产力不断提高和生产关系不断改进的巨大可能性，他们看不到人的政治觉悟的提高、生产热情的旺盛、劳动智慧的发挥、技术的进步、生产力的合理分布等等，对于提高劳动生产率所起的重大作用。在把劳动力当作商品的国家里，怎能出现像苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家劳动者那种忘我劳动精神和冲天干劲呢？在垄断资本占统治地位的国家里，怎会容许技术革新风行无阻呢？然而在社会主义国家，这些都是可以实现和势必实现的。这就是为什么四十多年来苏联经济基础扩大许多倍（例如现在一个月出产的钢，比1913年全年出产的还多），但至今工业生产仍能保持平均每年增长10％左右的高速度。这就是为什么苏联农业总产值从1940年到1952年这么多年中总共只增加10％，在1950—1953年中每年平均增长速度也只有1.6％，而在1954—1957年，由于改进了对农业的领导，提高了集体农民增产的积极性，增加了农业的投资和开垦了大片荒地，每年平均增长速度上升为7.1％，在七年计划期间还要上升为8％。这就是为什么中国的工农业和国民经济其他部门，由于大跃进和继续跃进，1958、1959两年发展的速度，比以往任何年份都高得多。
    社会主义各国经济之所以无例外地高速度发展，并没有什么秘方，但是资本主义国家就学不到，这是因为高速度的发展，是社会主义制度所固有的经济规律。生产资料的公有制，经济的有计划发展，使从资本主义经济枷锁中解放出来的社会生产力充分地发挥它的生命力。由于社会主义制度的优越性，社会主义国家在劳动生产率增长的速度上超过了资本主义国家，而这是保证新社会胜利的最主要条件，因为劳动生产率增长得越快，社会主义国家按人口计算的工农业生产量就会越快赶上和超过资本主义国家。最近几年社会主义国家劳动生产率增长速度大约比资本主义国家快一倍以上，其中苏联比美国快几倍。劳动生产率增长的速度决定于劳动者的社会地位和劳动者的技术装备，也就是生产力发展的两个因素——人的因素和物的因素。在社会主义国家里，劳动人民不是奴隶而是主人，他们的劳动不仅能够不断提高自己的生活水平，而且能够为实现人类最高理想——共产主义准备必需的物质基础，因此他们的热情洋溢，干劲冲天，创造了和创造着在资本主义制度下想像不到的奇迹；例如：苏联在1954—1956年内开垦了三千五百九十万公顷的荒地；中国在十八个大型钢铁企业以外，在不到一年内又建设了容积达四万多立方米，现在能够年产生铁一千万吨的小高炉，和可以年产四百万吨钢、在达到设计能力后可以年产七百万吨钢的小转炉。这是一方面。另一方面，在社会主义国家，先进技术的发明和应用，要比在资本主义国家迅速得多，广泛得多。因为社会主义国家培养着更多的科学技术人材，使科学技术人员具备有充分地发展才能的环境，而且使科学技术的发明创造成为全民的财富而不受资本家的垄断和封锁。所以苏联在宇宙火箭、原子能和其他许多尖端科学技术方面远远地走在美国前头。艾森豪威尔企求在苏联领先的那些科学和技术方面赶上苏联，然而至今只有一个比一个大的苏联人造地球卫星和人造宇宙行星上天，只有苏联的宇宙火箭精确地射中了月球，美国统治集团只好望空兴叹。社会主义各国的建设经验证明：人民群众的劳动热情和采用先进技术的积极性越大，劳动生产率就越高，而生产的高速度发展就越有保证。尽管国际反动分子把社会主义国家的人民的忘我劳动和冲天干劲污蔑是什么“奴役”“强迫劳动”，尽管他们把社会主义经济高速度发展和跃进诅咒成什么一瞬即逝的现象或者危机四伏的东西，但是几十年来苏联和十多年来其他社会主义各国的经济一直是扶摇直上、繁荣茂盛，社会主义国家的人民一直是斗志昂扬、意气风发地建设着自由幸福的生活。正是：癫狗尽管一旁狂吠，骏马照旧向前飞奔。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的国民经济高速度发展的结果，不仅使社会主义各国面貌迅速地改观，而且使世界社会主义体系和资本主义体系的经济对比发生着巨大的变化。现在，社会主义阵营各国人口占人类的35％，而他们的工业产量占世界工业总产量的三分之一以上，粮食占将近一半，棉花占43％。世界社会主义体系在按人口平均计算的工业产量方面已经超过资本主义体系。七年以后，由于比翼高飞的社会主义各国国民经济计划的完成和超额完成，社会主义体系的工业产量将占全世界工业总产量的一半以上，粮食、棉花的比重也将增加。因此，今后十年左右将是一个有决定意义的时期，在这个时期内社会主义体系将在物质生产领域取得压倒资本主义体系的胜利，这个胜利也就是世界持久和平和人类进步的最可靠的保证。
