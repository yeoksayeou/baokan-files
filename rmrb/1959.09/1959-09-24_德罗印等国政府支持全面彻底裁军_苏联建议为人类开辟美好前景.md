Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 21st: According to news released here tonight, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic unanimously agreed at a meeting held on the 21st with the proposal made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, at the United Nations General Assembly for complete and thorough disarmament.

The meeting held that these proposals open up inspiring and bright prospects for mankind to be forever freed from the terror and disasters of war. The implementation of these proposals will open the way for lasting peace between the peoples of all countries and ensure that the people of all continents can live in happiness and prosperity.

The Council of Ministers emphasized that the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament is of particular significance to the German people. Because the "Cold War" policy and the so-called policy of strength have made Europe one of the main focal points of international tensions, and atomic armament and revanchist policies have made West Germany one of the most serious sources of danger in Europe, where there is a threat of a new war. The national interests of the German people are more consistent with safeguarding world peace than ever before.

At the same time, the Council of Ministers once again called on the West German government to no longer continue its arms expansion. The government of the German Democratic Republic is willing to take any steps that will help achieve understanding and rapprochement for the great and noble goal of complete and thorough disarmament.

President of the German Democratic Republic, Pieck, and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ulbricht, also issued statements and talks respectively, fully supporting the Soviet disarmament proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, September 21st: At a banquet held on the evening of the 20th to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the founding of Bucharest, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, Chivu Stoica, said that Khrushchev's visit to the United States and the upcoming visit of the U.S. President to the Soviet Union are of great significance to world peace and security. The Romanian people and other peace-loving people of all countries sincerely welcome the proposal made by Khrushchev on behalf of the Soviet government at the United Nations General Assembly for complete and thorough disarmament. He said that this proposal opens up the only path for mankind to be liberated from the threat of war.

He pointed out that the Romanian people, together with all peace-loving people, warmly hope that the people of the world can live in an environment full of peace and security, and quietly enjoy the fruits of their labor obtained with their own hands and wisdom.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 23rd: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said on the 22nd that Khrushchev's disarmament proposal is "courageous and far-reaching."

Nehru made the remarks to the press at Palam Airport yesterday after visiting Afghanistan and Iran. He said that the proposal "deserves full consideration." He added that the issue of disarmament mainly depends on the major powers that possess strong weapons and armaments.

Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: According to TASS, Tehran, September 22nd: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference held in Tehran today before leaving that the proposal for complete disarmament made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, is a bold proposal and deserves serious consideration. Nehru said that today there are only two choices in the world: either coexistence or common destruction.

Nehru reiterated that military bases should be dismantled and welcomed the meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower.

Nehru left Tehran today to return home after a four-day visit to Iran.

Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: TASS, Kabul, September 21st: The Afghan newspaper "Islah" today published a statement by Afghan Prime Minister Mohammad Daoud to a reporter from the Eastern News Agency. Prime Minister Daoud welcomed the disarmament proposal made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, and said that if the disarmament issue can be resolved satisfactorily, it can pave the way for resolving other international issues. The Prime Minister also believes that the comprehensive proposal of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union has created a good foundation for future negotiations by the Ten-Nation Committee, whose task is to study issues related to disarmament.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 22nd: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio said today that any proposal that can promote the resolution of the disarmament issue and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons will definitely be welcomed by Indonesia.

He made these remarks to the press when answering questions about Khrushchev's new disarmament proposal to the United Nations.

Subandrio said: "Indonesia's task in this regard is to appeal politically and spiritually to countries involved in the arms race to listen to the voices of the masses around the world."

Subandrio said that no matter what differences of opinion may exist between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, their meeting has indeed aroused the close attention of world public opinion, which hopes to eliminate the threat of war.

Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, Suwirjo, told reporters from the Indonesian National News Agency on the 22nd that he supports Khrushchev's new disarmament proposal regarding the destruction of all weapons and the reduction of armed forces.

Suwirjo said that for every Indonesian who believes in the Pancasila, there is no other way but to express approval of this proposal, even though this new proposal was put forward by a Communist.

Suwirjo continued by saying that Khrushchev's proposal will not only eliminate all factors that could lead to war, but also contains humanitarian factors. He finally expressed hope that this proposal could be realized satisfactorily as soon as possible.

    德罗印等国政府支持全面彻底裁军
    苏联建议为人类开辟美好前景
    据新华社柏林21日电　据这里今晚发表的消息说，德意志民主共和国部长会议在21日举行的会议上一致同意苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会上提出的全面彻底裁军的建议。
    会议认为，这些建议给人类打开了永远从战争的恐怖和灾难中解脱出来的令人鼓舞的美好远景。实现这些建议将会打开各国人民之间持久和平的道路，并保障各大洲人民能在幸福和繁荣中生活。
    部长会议强调指出，苏联的全面彻底裁军的建议，对于德国人民具有特别的意义。因为“冷战”政策和所谓实力地位政策，使欧洲成为国际紧张局势的主要汇合点之一，而原子武装和复仇主义政策，使西德成为欧洲最严重的危险策源地之一，那里存在着一次新战争的威胁。德国人民的民族利益比过去任何时候都更加与保障世界和平相一致了。
    同时，部长会议再次向西德政府呼吁不再继续扩军。德意志民主共和国政府愿意采取任何有助于实现全面彻底裁军这一伟大和崇高目的的谅解和接近的步骤。
    德意志民主共和国总统皮克和德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希也分别发表声明和谈话，完全支持苏联的裁军建议。
    据新华社布加勒斯特21日电　罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡在20日晚间，为布加勒斯特建城五百周年而举行的宴会上说，赫鲁晓夫在美国的访问以及不久以后美国总统对苏联的访问对全世界的和平和安全具有重大意义。罗马尼亚人民和其它爱好和平的各国人民衷心欢迎赫鲁晓夫代表苏联政府在联合国大会上提出的全面、彻底裁军的建议。他说，这一建议为人类从战争威胁下解放出来开辟了唯一的道路。
    他指出，罗马尼亚人民同所有爱好和平的人民一起，热烈希望全世界人民能够在充满和平和安全的环境下生活，安静地享用他们用自己的双手和智慧获得的劳动成果。
    新华社新德里23日电　印度总理尼赫鲁22日说，赫鲁晓夫提出的裁军建议，是“勇敢而有深远影响的”。
    尼赫鲁在访问阿富汗和伊朗后昨天回到新德里。他在巴兰机场向报界发表谈话时说：这个建议“值得充分考虑。”他又说，关于裁军问题，主要取决于拥有强大的武器和军备的各个大国。
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社德黑兰22日讯：印度总理尼赫鲁今天在离开德黑兰以前举行的记者招待会上说，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫提出的关于全面裁军的建议是一个大胆的建议，值得加以认真的考虑。尼赫鲁说，今天在世界上只有两种选择：要么是共处，要么是共同毁灭。
    尼赫鲁重申应该撤销军事基地，并且表示欢迎赫鲁晓夫与艾森豪威尔会谈。
    尼赫鲁在伊朗访问了四天以后，今天离开德黑兰回国。
    据新华社22日讯　塔斯社喀布尔21日讯：阿富汗“革新报”今天登载了阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德对东方通讯社记者发表的谈话。达乌德首相欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于裁军的建议，他说，如果裁军问题能够完满解决，就能够开辟道路来解决其他国际问题。首相还认为，苏联部长会议主席的无所不包的建议为将来十国代表委员会的谈判创造了良好的基础，十国代表委员会的任务是研究有关裁军的问题。
    新华社雅加达22日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今天说，任何可以促使解决裁军问题和禁止使用核武器的建议都肯定地会受到印度尼西亚的欢迎。
    他是在回答有关赫鲁晓夫向联合国提出的新裁军建议的问题时向报界说这番话的。
    苏班德里约说：“印度尼西亚在这方面的任务是从政治上和精神上来呼吁卷入军备竞赛的国家倾听世界各地群众的呼声。”
    苏班德里约说，不论赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔之间可能存在着什么不同的意见，他们的会见的确引起了希望消除战争威胁的世界公众舆论的密切注意。
    印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约22日对印度尼西亚民族通讯社记者说，他赞成赫鲁晓夫提出的关于销毁一切武器和裁减武装部队的新裁军建议。
    苏维约说，对于每个信奉建国五基的印度尼西亚人来说，除了表示赞同这个建议之外，别无其它办法，虽然这个新建议是一个共产党人提出来的。
    苏维约接着说，赫鲁晓夫的建议不仅将消灭一切足以导致战争的因素，而且还含有人道主义的因素。他最后表示希望，这个建议能够早日完满实现。
