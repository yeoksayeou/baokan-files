Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Dispatch: As of September 17th, statistics show that in the four major industrial cities of Heilongjiang Province – Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, and Mudanjiang – more than 330 factories had completed their third-quarter production plans ahead of schedule.

　　In Harbin City, as of the 17th, the cumulative value of completed third-quarter production plans reached over 90%. Among the 40 major products included in the state plan, 15 products, including pig iron, freight cars, bearings, power station boilers, industrial tools, bare copper wire, bare aluminum wire, caustic soda, rubber shoes, and fountain pens, had already completed their third-quarter targets ahead of schedule.

　　Qiqihar Farm Implement Machinery Factory overfulfilled its third-quarter plan sixteen days ahead of schedule, with output value increasing by 45% compared to the same period last year. Among the factories in Jiamusi City that completed their third-quarter plans ahead of schedule, the more important ones include the Coal Mining Machinery Factory, Power Machinery Factory, Electrical Factory, and Friendship Cotton Mill. After studying the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy," the Power Machinery Factory raised its August output value target by 52%, and as a result, overfulfilled the target, laying the foundation for completing the third-quarter plan ahead of schedule.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 22nd: The Harbin Boiler Factory overfulfilled its annual boiler production plan for this year more than three months ahead of schedule on September 20th. So far, the power station boilers produced by this factory have been supplied to meet the needs of 14 provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, Anhui, Shandong, and Liaoning.

　　From the beginning of this year, the Harbin Boiler Factory opposed the slackening mood of "taking a break," and better integrated enterprise management with mass movements. After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, competition was further launched between workshops, groups, and workers, significantly improving production efficiency. So far, one-fifth of the workers in the factory have completed their annual workload for this year ahead of schedule, and 47 work sections and groups have completed one to three or more years of work.

    三百多工厂完成季度计划
    哈尔滨锅炉厂全年锅炉生产任务提前完成
    据新华社哈尔滨电　到9月17日止统计，黑龙江省哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、牡丹江四大工业城市，已有三百三十多个工厂提前完成了第三季度的生产计划。
    哈尔滨市到17日累计，已完成三季度产值计划90％以上。四十种纳入国家计划的主要产品中，生铁、货车、轴承、电站锅炉、工业用工具、裸铜线、裸铝线、烧碱、胶鞋、金笔等十五种产品，已提前完成了三季度计划指标。
    齐齐哈尔农具机械厂提前十六天超额完成了第三季度计划，产值比去年同期增长45％。佳木斯市提前完成第三季计划的工厂中，比较重要的有煤矿机械厂、动力机械厂、电工厂、友谊棉织厂等。动力机械厂在学习人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论后，把8月份的产值指标提高了52％，结果超额完成，为提前完成第三季度计划打下了基础。
    据新华社哈尔滨22日电　哈尔滨锅炉厂在9月20日提前三个多月超额完成了今年全年的锅炉生产计划。到目前为止，这个厂生产的电站锅炉，已经供应了山西、云南、四川、安徽、山东、辽宁等十四个省市的需要。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂今年一开始，就反对了“歇一歇”的松劲情绪，并把企业管理和群众运动更好地结合起来。党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，车间与车间、小组与小组、工人与工人之间更进一步地展开了竞赛，使生产效率显著提高。到目前为止，全厂有五分之一的工人已经提前完成了今年全年的工作量，有四十七个工段、小组完成了一年到三年多的工作量。
