To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
Dear Comrades:
    On behalf of our Party Central Committee and the democratic people of our country, we extend our warmest, heartfelt, and comradely greetings to you, the competent leaders of the Party and the people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and all the heroic Chinese people.
    The great Chinese people have achieved historically significant victories in the struggle against fascist oppression, poverty, enslavement, and against foreign interventionists and imperialism. This victory is the result of the Chinese people's arduous, long-term, and selfless struggle. This victory is a major blow to colonialism and a historic stage marking the complete collapse of the despicable colonial system.
    The democratic people of Cyprus, led by the working class and its party, view the historic victory of the Chinese people with excitement and optimism, regarding this victory as a great contribution to their own struggle for liberation from the shackles of colonialism.
    The past ten years have been a decade of comprehensive construction of their homeland by the Chinese people through hard work on peaceful land. Our Party, our people, at all times, even under the most difficult conditions, have been deeply concerned about the achievements of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. We wholeheartedly applaud the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with its Central Committee and dear Comrade Mao Zedong at the head.
    There is no doubt that the creative, active, and heroic Chinese people will achieve even greater successes in the construction of socialism and communism in China, and in the struggle for the benefit of all progressive humanity and against the madness of imperialism. Our people look forward to and hope for new and greater achievements by the Chinese people.
    Now the people of Cyprus are struggling to break free from the shackles of foreign occupation imposed on them by the Zurich and London agreements, to achieve complete national independence and the abolition of foreign military bases, and to realize a thorough democratic constitution for the Republic of Cyprus. The great achievements of the Chinese people and the entire socialist camp on the international stage are a source of courage and confidence for the Cypriot people in their glorious labor and long struggle for victory in achieving true freedom and democracy.
    We look forward to the future with confidence and believe that through the joint struggle of the great army of peace defenders around the world, through the great achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries of the socialist camp, and through the struggle of the people of all countries for independence, peace, freedom, and truth will triumph in the world.
    Long live the historic victory of the Chinese people!
    Long live the Communist Party of China, the inspirer and leader of the Chinese people's struggle for peace, freedom, and socialism!
    May the friendship between the Chinese and Cypriot people be consolidated and developed!
    Long live the internationalist solidarity of the people of all countries!
                        Central Committee of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus

    塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党的贺信中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    代表我们党中央和我国民主的人民向你们，向党和人民称职的领导者，向中华人民共和国政府，向全体英雄的中国人民表示最热烈的、衷心的、同志式的祝福。
    伟大的中国人民在反对法西斯压迫，反对贫困，反对奴役以及在反对外国干涉者和帝国主义的斗争中，取得了具有历史意义的胜利。这个胜利，是中国人民进行的、残酷的、长期的、忘我的斗争的结果。这个胜利，是对殖民主义的重大打击，是使可耻的殖民主义制度走向完全崩溃的重大转折的历史阶段。
    以工人阶级及它的党为首的塞浦路斯的民主人民，以兴奋心情和乐观主义看待中国人民的历史胜利，把这种胜利看成是对他们自己的为从殖民主义枷锁下解放出来的斗争的伟大贡献。
    过去的十年是中国人民在和平的土地上通过艰苦的工作全面建设自己祖国的十年。我们的党，我们的人民在任何时候甚至在最困难的条件下，都是十分关切中国共产党和中国人民的成就。衷心的欢呼中国人民在以自己的中央委员会和亲爱的毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下取得的巨大成就。
    毫无疑问，有创造精神的积极的英勇的中国人民，将在中国的社会主义和共产主义的建设中，在为全体进步人类的利益和反对帝国主义的疯狂的斗争中，取得更大的成就。我国人民期待和希望中国人民取得新的更大的成就。
    现在塞浦路斯的人民正在进行斗争，以摆脱由于苏黎世和万隆协议强加在它头上的外国占领枷锁以取得国家的完全的独立和取消外国的军事基地，以及实现塞浦路斯共和国的彻底的民主宪法。中国人民和整个社会主义阵营在国际舞台上的伟大成就对塞浦路斯人民来说是在为了取得真正的自由和民主而进行辉煌劳动和长期斗争中获得胜利而鼓舞勇敢和增强信心的泉源。
    我们充满信心地展望未来。并且相信通过全世界保卫和平的战士大军的共同斗争，通过苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营其它国家的伟大的成就，通过各国人民为独立的斗争将使和平、自由和真理在世界上获得胜利。
    中国人民的具有历史意义的胜利万岁！
    中国人民为和平、自由、和社会主义斗争的鼓舞者和领导者中国共产党万岁！
    让中国人民和塞浦路斯人民之间的友谊巩固和发展吧！
    全世界各国人民的国际主义团结万岁！
                         塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党中央委员会
