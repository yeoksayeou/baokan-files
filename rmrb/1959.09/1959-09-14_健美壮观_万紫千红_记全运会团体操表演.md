On the afternoon of the 13th, just as the solemn opening ceremony of the National Games concluded, five large-scale mass gymnastics performances, all entitled "National Celebration," began! The majestic Beijing Workers' Stadium was transformed into a sea of people and a sea of flowers!

More than 600 Young Pioneers, waving colorful bouquets, rushed in from the center of the guard of honor, scattering like stars in the sky, running towards the rostrum and the surrounding stands, presenting bunches of large flowers to our beloved leader Chairman Mao and the surrounding audience. Instantly, thunderous applause resounded throughout the stadium!

"Happy Children"

After the Young Pioneers finished presenting flowers, the first performance was "Happy Children," collectively performed by more than 1,800 elementary school students from 19 schools in Beijing's Chaoyang District. The girls were dressed like peach blossoms in March, and the boys were adorned like green jade. Stepping to the rhythm of the music, they sometimes waved their little hands like swallows spreading their wings, and sometimes crouched down like little pigeons pecking at food; suddenly, they formed rows of beautiful "fan faces."

The entire stadium then featured hundreds of round pits formed by human bodies. The children shoveled soil and watered in the circular pits, and in the blink of an eye, green tree buds emerged from the center of the circles, gradually unfurling their branches and leaves, turning the entire field into a green sea! Suddenly, a magnificent garden appeared in the green willows. Boys holding green willows circled to form a green belt, while the girls changed various formations and enjoyed themselves in the garden. The children of New China, under the care and education of the Party and the government, live and grow up so happily; they love labor, love the motherland, love the Party and Chairman Mao. After their performance, they lined up and sang "The Young Pioneers Song," waving their little hands to Chairman Mao and the surrounding audience, and exited the venue from the four gates amidst applause.

"Flowers of Youth"

More than a thousand beautiful young girls, dressed in bright and dazzling fashions, each waving two red balls, walked towards the audience from different directions!

As the formations changed, the entire field became a fairyland of blossoming peonies with tender green leaves; in a flash, hundreds of flowers lined up, and they waved their colored balls like dozens of flower dragons rolling on the ground. Suddenly, a field of red flowers transformed into green, and thirty-six magnificent flower beds appeared before our eyes. Groups of butterflies spread their silk wings and danced from both sides of the garden, flying among the flowers. The flowers bloomed in full splendor, and the butterflies danced in pairs. The flower beds and butterflies playing changed into rhomboids, then ovals, and then flower towers appeared.

Hundreds of pairs of butterflies folded their wings, all becoming "flower fairies." The girls lay on the lawn, forming a large eight-petaled, eight-layered, multicolored flower, with four fountains at the four corners of the flower. Instantly, the flower embroidered on the lawn moved and came to life! Five red-and-yellow stamens rotated, and the colored petals opened and closed, accompanied by the beautiful music, the "Flowers of Youth" interlude was played:

	Spring breeze blows, swallows come
	The motherland is full of flowers
	Green willows reflect new embankments
	White clouds beyond the green hills...

"Martial Arts Competition of Heroes"

A group of young men and women dressed as warriors. The men, holding eyebrow-level staves high, stepped to the music with clear rhythms and the gongs and drums of Peking Opera, first rushed onto the field and danced with the eyebrow-level staves. The entire field was filled with shimmering silver light, and the staves generated wind.

Seventeen groups of heroines came up, walking in "circular steps," and men and women engaged in combat and fought each other. The men showed the "tiger-fighting stance," and the women used the "golden rooster stands on one leg"; the men used the "seated double hook hand," and the women used the "exploring the sea"...

"Healthy Youth"

After the martial arts performance, "Healthy Youth" began! Seventy pairs of beautifully shaped young men and women spread out their formations, holding hands and performing "turning body" movements. The female athletes were lifted up by strongmen, completing "knee balance" and "splits" in mid-air; then they stepped onto the shoulders of the male strongmen, like magpies landing on plum blossoms, performing "single-leg standing balance."

The fact that several ordinary students of the sports institute were able to perform these highly difficult and beautifully shaped skill performances won round after round of applause from the audience.

"Long Live the Motherland"

A group of girls, dressed in green skirts and holding orange-yellow wheat ears, walked out slowly, changing into several formations, turning the entire field into a golden, shimmering wheat field covering the earth. As the wind blew, the heavy wheat ears shook their heads, rising and falling left and right, tilting forward and backward. It praised the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes and the victory of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production increase!

The worker contingent, dressed in coffee-colored overalls, marched onto the field in eighteen columns, chanting slogans of "Exercise to build the motherland" and "Exercise to defend the motherland." They performed the heroic postures of "swinging the hammer," "sawing," and "pounding the earth" with uniform movements. Suddenly, dozens of rows of people with their backs to each other, from front to back, like a giant ship breaking through the waves, split and lay down on both sides, symbolizing the workers operating machines, and a large number of products were produced like a tide. After a period of formation changes, high furnaces appeared everywhere. You see, on one side the wheat waves rolled, and on the other side the high furnaces stood, the two reflecting each other, showing the unbreakable alliance of workers and peasants and the grand prospect of jointly building a socialist motherland!

Finally, a huge "flower turning platform" surrounded by red flags slowly moved forward. Four large "red umbrellas" were lined up on both sides of the "flower turning platform." Athletes dressed as workers and peasants adjusted their formations. Amidst the loud sound of "Long Live the Motherland," the words "Long Live the Motherland," "1949," and "1959" appeared in front of the rostrum and on both sides of the flower turning platform. As a flower pattern sculpture as beautiful as the "Temple of Heaven" composed of twelve layers of people appeared on the "flower turning platform," the five-star red flag of the motherland fluttered high above the "flower turning platform." Instantly, the layers of people on the "flower turning platform" turned flowers beautifully, the "red umbrellas" were spun by the girls pulling the ribbons, and tens of thousands of athletes sang the song "Singing the Motherland," the whole field was full of flowers and the cheers thundered.

    健美壮观  万紫千红
    ——记全运会团体操表演
    新华社记者　姜文品
    13日下午，全国运动会庄严的入场式刚结束，五个大型的全名为“全民同庆”的团体操表演开始了！雄伟的北京工人体育场，简直变成了人海，花海！
    六百多名红领巾舞动着五颜六色的花束，从仪仗队当心冲进来，像天空的繁星一般撒开，朝着主席台和四周的看台跑去，把束束大花献给了我们敬爱的领袖毛主席和四周的观众。顿时，周场响起了春雷般的掌声！
    “幸福儿童”
    少先队献花结束，表演的头一个节目是“幸福儿童”，这是北京朝阳区十九个小学、一千八百多个小学生集体表演的。孩子们女的打扮得像三月桃花，男的装束得如碧玉，踏着音乐节奏，时而摆动着小手如小燕展翅，时而伏地屈着小腰像小鸽啄食；忽而又叠成一排排美丽的“扇面”。
    全场又出现了由人体组成的数百个圆坑，孩子们在环坑铲土、浇水，眨眼间，从圆心中露出了一枝枝葱绿的树芽，渐渐地舒开枝叶，合场变成了一片绿海！顿时，绿柳丛中又出现了一座瑰丽的大花园。手执绿柳的男生环圈成一条碧带，女孩子在花园内变换着各种队形尽情地玩乐。新中国的儿童，在党和政府的关怀教育下，就是这样幸福地生活着、成长着；他们热爱劳动，热爱祖国，热爱党和毛主席。他们表演结束，排队高唱着“红领巾之歌”，向毛主席和四周的观众招着小手，在会场掌声中分路从四门退出会场。
    “青春的花朵”
    一千多名美丽的少女，穿着鲜艳耀眼的时装，每人手里舞动着两朵红球，分路朝着观众走来！
    队形变处，全场变成了一片嫩枝绿叶牡丹盛开的仙境；一闪，又百花成行，她们挥动着彩球好像数十条花龙在大地翻滚。忽而，一片红花幻变为绿，眼前出现了三十六个瑰丽的花坛，成群的蝴蝶舒开绫翅从花园两侧翩翩起舞，飞入花间。花儿在怒放，蝶儿在对舞。花坛嬉蝶，一时成棱形，一时成椭圆形，又出现了花塔。
    成百对蝴蝶叠起翅膀，都成了“百花仙子”。姑娘们仰在草坪上，组成了一朵八瓣八层、五颜六色的大花朵，花儿四角，配有四个喷泉，瞬间，绣在草坪上的花朵动了，活了！五枝红里套黄的花蕊在旋转，各色的花瓣在时开时合，伴随着优美的音乐曲调，传来了“青春的花朵”插曲：
    春风吹　燕子来
    祖国大地百花开
    绿柳映新堤
    白云青山外……
    “群英比武”
    一群武士打扮的男、女青年。男子们，高举齐眉棍，踏着有鲜明节奏的音乐和京剧中的锣鼓点，首先冲出场来，欢舞起齐眉棍。只见全场银光闪闪，棍棒生风。
    十七路女中英雄，走着“圆场步”上来，男女交锋，对打起来。男子亮出“打虎式”，女子用出“金鸡独立”；男子施出“坐盘双钩手”，女子用了“探海”……。
    “健美的青春”
    武打过去，“健美的青春”，又开始表演了！七十对体型优美的男女青年，撒开队形，手拉手作着“转体”动作。女运动员被大力士托起，在半空作完“膝平衡”和“劈腿”；又踏上男子大力士肩头，如同鹊雀登梅，作了“单腿站立平衡”。
    几个普通的体育学院的学生能作出这些难度很大，造型健美的技巧表演，博得了观众一阵又一阵的掌声。
    “祖国万岁”
    一群姑娘，齐著绿裙，手擎橙黄色的麦穗，缓步走了出来，变换了几种队形，全场变成了一片金光闪闪、遮满大地的麦田。风儿吹来，那沉甸甸的麦穗摇着头儿，左右起伏，前后仰合。它歌颂了人民公社的无比优越和农业增产“八字宪法”的胜利！
    穿着咖啡色工装服的工人队伍分十八路纵队，高呼着“锻炼身体，建设祖国”“锻炼身体，保卫祖国”的口号，雄壮地走上场。他们以整齐划一的动作表演了“抡锤”“拉锯”“打夯”的英恣，突然，数十排双人脊背相依的人群，由前及后，如巨轮破浪一般，向两旁分列伏卧，象征着工人们操纵着机器，大批的产品如潮水一般地生产出来。经过一阵队形变换，全场又出现了遍地高炉。你瞧，一旁是麦浪翻滚，一边是高炉林立，两相交互映辉，显示着工农联盟的牢不可破，共建社会主义祖国的宏伟远景！
    最后，由一片红旗环抱着的一个巨大的“翻花台”徐徐向前移动。四顶大“红罗伞”分列在“翻花台”的两旁。扮作工人和农民的运动员调好队形，在“祖国万岁”一声巨音中，在主席台前和翻花台的两侧出现了“祖国万岁”、“1949”和“1959”十二个大字。随着“翻花台”上又出现了由十二层人组成与“天坛”一般美丽的花纹雕塑，祖国的五星红旗高高地飘扬在“翻花台”的上空。霎时，“翻花台”上的人层在翻花作美，“红罗伞”在被少女们牵着彩带旋转，成千上万的运动员们唱起了“歌唱祖国”的歌曲，全场一时花簇如锦，欢声雷动。（附图片）
