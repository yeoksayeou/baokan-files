Xinhua News Agency, 14th - In some parts of North China, autumn plowing and wheat sowing have already begun.

The large-scale autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing work is approaching. The Ministry of Agriculture held a telephone conference on the Three Autumns work on the evening of the 12th, with the participation of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture, also attended the meeting. At the meeting, Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out: There are only twenty-plus days left until the late autumn harvest. These twenty-plus days are extremely valuable for the Three Autumns work, especially the wheat sowing work, for this year's autumn bumper harvest, and for next year's summer bumper harvest.

Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Anhui provinces reported on the current production situation and the preparation for the Three Autumns work at the telephone conference. According to the reports, autumn plowing and wheat sowing work has already begun in some parts of North China. The call for increased production and thrift from the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee has deeply penetrated the broad masses of commune members in the people's communes. The rural areas' reversal of right-leaning tendencies and boosting of enthusiasm have generally formed a high tide of surpassing production targets. People's communes in various localities are not only vigorously grasping late autumn field management, but also vigorously grasping the preparation work for the Three Autumns. The preparation work for the Three Autumns in most areas is more adequate and practical than last year, and autumn plowing and wheat sowing are greatly advanced compared to last year.

Hebei Province reported that this year's wheat sowing preparation is good, conditions are good, and enthusiasm is sufficient, and there is confidence in sowing more and sowing well. The province's plan to expand wheat sowing this year has basically been fully implemented in every production team of the people's communes, about 70% of the wheat sowing arable land has been arranged, and about 40% of the production teams have already done the work of contracting production, contracting labor, and contracting costs for wheat sowing. Now, most of the early autumn crops have been harvested, and autumn plowing is being carried out in a concentrated manner, with the slogan "Harvest one mu, plow one mu." The province has already plowed more than 3 million mu. Various localities are accepting the experience of deep plowing last year and the bumper wheat harvest this year, and are paying great attention to deep plowing, generally plowing to about eight inches, and a few to more than one foot. This year's wheat sowing arable land, seeds, water, and fertilizer conditions are all good. The whole province has a total of 32 million mu of regular wheat land and land for sowing wheat after harvesting early autumn crops, the stubble is good, and the soil moisture is good, which can be sown in a timely manner. More than 80% of the wheat fields can be irrigated regularly next spring, and others can also be watered once or twice. The wheat seeds have basically been resolved, and most of them have been tested for germination; the amount of seeds used is generally about 20 jin. The base fertilizer for wheat land already has fertilizer, saying that an average of 4,000 to 5,000 jin can be applied per mu. The quality of the fertilizer is better than last year, and about half is manure. The whole province has great enthusiasm and confidence in striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year. The only problem at present is that the labor force is relatively tight, and not much fertilizer has been sent out. Various localities are seizing the time to send fertilizer, and have proposed the method of "people not empty-handed, vehicles not empty," and people and animals going to the fields for the autumn harvest must bring fertilizer with them. The wheat sowing preparation work reported by other provinces is generally better than last year. Shandong has plowed more than 17 million mu of wheat sowing land, and Henan has plowed more than 21 million mu. Various localities are paying great attention to deep plowing and close planting. Most are plowing six to eight inches, and a few are more than eight inches. Seed preparation is generally about 20 to 25 jin per mu. The quality of the 258,000+ mu already sown in Shandong is generally better than last year. The drought in Jiangsu, Shanxi, and most areas of Shandong has basically been alleviated, and timely sowing is not a big problem. What is still feeling the drought is Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei, and the drought situation is still developing in some areas. For this reason, Henan is vigorously grasping drought resistance and wheat sowing, vigorously irrigating land prepared for wheat sowing, and carrying out shock repairs to water conservancy projects to ensure drought resistance and timely sowing. Shaanxi also requires various localities to water before harvesting autumn crops, so as to plow and sow with the harvest.

The provinces also reported on the current development of the surpassing production movement and the preparation for the autumn harvest. Henan's rural areas have invested more than 20 million laborers to vigorously grasp the surpassing production and bumper harvest of six major crops: potatoes, cotton, oil crops, late rice, tobacco, and autumn vegetables. The main measures are drought resistance and watering, pest control and weeding, striving for high yields of grain and oil, more cotton harvest, more autumn vegetables, and cultivation of second-crop tobacco. The autumn harvest preparations in various localities are also being stepped up. Counties and people's communes have generally established autumn sowing and autumn harvest headquarters, and county and commune cadres have gone deep into the production teams to lead the Three Autumns work. Shandong, Anhui, and other places have also made achievements in the reform and supplementation of the Three Autumns tools.

At the meeting, Comrade Tan Zhenlin gave important instructions on the Three Autumns work. He demanded that all localities conscientiously reverse right-leaning tendencies, boost enthusiasm, and effectively harvest well, cultivate well, sow well, and manage well; seize the current extremely valuable twenty-plus days for the Three Autumns work, especially wheat sowing, to make further full preparations. Regarding autumn plowing preparation, first of all, the plan and contracted production must be implemented. The plan must be quickly implemented to the production team, and every piece of wheat sowing land must be arranged so that the team knows how much wheat to sow and which land to sow. The contracted production must be quickly contracted according to the principle of increasing production more than this year and enabling the team to surpass the production target. Then, vigorously grasp the production increase measures, and help the commune and the production team to realize the production increase measures in a planned way. Secondly, the fertilizer preparation must be checked immediately, and if the fertilizer is insufficient, a shock fertilizer accumulation must be organized. This year's wheat sowing must eliminate the phenomenon of sowing on bare land and sowing on hardened land. Water preparation must also be grasped to ensure that most wheat fields can be irrigated this winter and next spring. This year's autumn plowing should pay attention to leveling the land and opening good ridges and ditches, so as to make full use of all water sources. Comrade Tan Zhenlin also proposed that this year's wheat sowing is best to do from far to near, and to sow the distant and thin land conscientiously, so as to eliminate the phenomenon of the disparity in output caused by only paying attention to the nearby good land and not paying attention to the distant and thin land, and further strive for a large area of universal bumper harvest. He also required all localities and people's communes to continue to engage in bumper harvest plots and command fields, and to engage in more or less depending on the specific conditions.

The meeting finally called on all localities to boost enthusiasm and strive for a complete victory in the Three Autumns work. All localities must not only sow wheat well, but also sow summer-harvested miscellaneous grain crops such as rape and peas and broad beans well, reversing the phenomenon of not paying attention to summer-harvested miscellaneous grains. The meeting also reminded all localities to pay attention to preventing possible natural disasters before the autumn harvest, especially to prevent early frost.

    抓紧目前非常宝贵的二十多天进一步作好充分准备
    收好耕好种好力争三秋全胜
    八个省在农业部电话会议上汇报当前生产和三秋工作准备情况
    谭震林要求各地把右倾反掉，把干劲鼓足，争取今秋明夏大丰收
    新华社14日讯　华北各省部分地区，秋耕种麦已经开始。
    大规模的秋收、秋耕和秋种工作日益迫近。农业部在12日晚上召开了有全国各省、市、自治区参加的三秋工作电话会议。中共中央书记处书记、国务院副总理谭震林，农业部部长廖鲁言等都参加了这次会议。会上，谭震林同志指出：现在到晚秋成熟只有二十多天。这二十多天时间对于三秋工作特别是种麦工作，对于今年秋季的丰产丰收和明年的夏季大丰收，都是非常宝贵的。
    山西、河北、河南、山东、陕西、江苏、湖北和安徽八省在电话会议上汇报了当前的生产情况和三秋工作的准备。据汇报：华北各省部分地区的秋耕种麦工作已经开始。党的八中全会的增产节约号召深入了人民公社的广大社员群众，农村反右倾、鼓干劲普遍形成了超产运动的高潮。各地人民公社不仅大抓晚秋田管理，而且大抓三秋准备工作。大部地区的三秋准备工作作得比去年充分和切实，秋耕和种麦比去年大大提早了。
    河北省汇报说，今年种麦准备好、条件好、干劲足，有把握多种和种好。全省今年扩大种麦的计划基本上已经完全落实到人民公社的每一生产队，70％左右的种麦耕地已经安排好了，40％左右的生产队已经作了种麦的包产、包工、包成本工作。现在早秋作物大部已收，正在突击秋耕，口号是收一亩耕一亩。全省已经耕了三百多万亩。各地接受去年深耕今年小麦丰收的经验都很注意深耕，一般耕到八寸左右，少数耕到了一尺以上。今年种麦耕地、种子和水肥等条件都好。全省正茬麦地和收早秋种麦的地共达三千二百万亩，茬口好，墒情好，能够适时播种。明春80％以上的麦田都能经常灌溉，其他也能浇一两次水。麦种基本已经解决，而且大部作了发芽试验；用种量一般可达二十斤左右。麦地基肥就已有肥料说每亩平均可施四千到五千斤。肥料质量比去年好，半数左右是圈肥。全省对争取明年小麦丰收的干劲和信心都很大。当前唯一的问题是劳力比较紧张，肥料已经送出的不多。各地正在抓紧送肥，提出了“人不空手，车不空走”的办法，秋收的人畜下地都要随带肥料。其他各省汇报的种麦准备工作一般都比去年好。山东种麦的地已耕了一千七百多万亩，河南已耕了二千一百多万亩。各地都很注意深耕和密植。大部都耕六寸到八寸，少数在八寸以上。种子准备一般是每亩二十到二十五斤左右。山东已种的二十五万八千多亩质量普遍比去年好。江苏、山西等省及山东大部地区旱象已经基本解除，适时播种，问题不大。目前仍感干旱的是陕西、河南和湖北，而且部分地区旱情还在发展。为此河南正在大抓抗旱种麦，大力为准备种麦的土地灌水和突击兴修水利，保证抗旱适时播种。陕西还要求各地在秋熟作物收前就浇水，以便随收随耕，随耕随播。
    各省还汇报了当前超产运动开展情况和秋收的准备工作。河南农村已投入两千多万劳动力大抓薯类、棉花、油料、晚稻、烟叶、秋菜等六大作物的超产丰收。措施主要是抗旱浇水、除虫除草，争取粮油高产，棉花多收，多种秋菜和培育二茬烟。各地秋收准备也正加紧进行，县和人民公社一般都成立了秋种秋收指挥部，县社干部多已深入生产队，领导三秋工作。山东、安徽等地三秋工具的改革增补工作也有成绩。
    会上，谭震林同志对三秋工作作了重要指示。他要求各地认真把右倾反掉，把干劲鼓足，切实收好、耕好、种好、管好；抓紧目前非常宝贵的二十多天为三秋工作，特别是种麦作进一步的充分准备。关于秋耕准备首先须把计划和包产落实。计划要迅速落实到生产小队，要把每一块种麦的地都安排好，使小队知道种多少麦、种那些地。包产要按比今年增产又能使小队能够超产的原则迅速包好。然后就大抓增产措施，有计划地帮助公社，帮助生产队实现增产措施。其次肥料准备须立即检查，肥料不足要组织突击积肥。今年种麦无论如何要消灭白地下种和板田下种的现象。水的准备也要抓，要保证大多数麦田今冬明春都能浇灌。今年秋耕要注意平整土地和开好畦渠，以便充分利用一切水源。谭震林同志还提出今年种麦最好由远及近，把远地薄地都认真种好，来消灭由于只注意近地好地、不注意远地薄地所造成的产量悬殊的现象，进一步争取大面积地普遍丰产。他还要求各地各人民公社继续搞丰产方和指挥田，搞多搞少视具体条件而定。
    会议最后要求各地大鼓干劲，争取三秋工作的全胜。各地不仅要把小麦种好，油菜和豌蚕豆等夏收杂粮作物也要种好，扭转不重视夏收杂粮的现象。会议还提起各地要注意预防秋收前可能还有的自然灾害，特别要预防早霜。
