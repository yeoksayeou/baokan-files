Dear comrades:
    On the occasion of the great festival of the victory of the Chinese revolution and the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and the entire Albanian people, to extend to you, and through you to the great Chinese people, the warmest and most profound brotherly congratulations. The victory of the Chinese revolution has very important historical international significance. After the great October Revolution, the victory of the Chinese revolution was the most significant international event, because it liberated 600 million people from centuries of shackles, dealt imperialism a second heavy and devastating blow, and became the beginning of a new era in the history of Asian nations. This historic victory further strengthened the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and changed the balance of power on the international stage in favor of socialism and to the disadvantage of imperialism. This historic victory was achieved by the great and heroic Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the great son of the Chinese people, our respected Comrade Mao Zedong, through a heroic, long-term, bloody and complex struggle.
    The People's Republic of China has been established for ten years, which is not a long period in history, but this period has proved the vitality and glory of the great Chinese people, because during this period the Chinese people have achieved a historic turning point in the development of their own country. This is a decade of continuous and great achievements in China's socialist construction. The rapid development of industry, the complete transformation of agriculture on the socialist road, the practical achievements in this regard, the tremendous achievements your great country has made in the development of culture and education, the continuous consolidation of the people's power, and the continuous improvement of the international prestige of the People's China, all prove the invincible power of Marxism-Leninism, the great strength of the Chinese people, and the unity of the Chinese people around the Communist Party, which always holds high the victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism.
    The Albanian people are infinitely happy for the brilliant achievements made by the great and talented Chinese people, and celebrate your great festival together with the people of all countries in the socialist camp as if celebrating their own festival. The Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the government wholeheartedly wish the great Chinese people greater achievements on the road of socialist construction; we wish the great leader of the Chinese people, the respected Comrade Mao Zedong, longevity like the mountains of Albania for the happiness of the Chinese people and for the victory of socialism and communism.
    For ten years, you have transformed the face of your great motherland with your selfless labor, with the generous and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and are now marching forward along the road of socialist construction.
    Great People's China, together with the Soviet Union, other socialist countries, and all peace-loving countries, is waging an unwavering struggle to defend world peace. People's China has become a strong fortress of socialism and peace, and today no major international issues can be completely resolved without the participation of great People's China. The Albanian government has always supported and will always firmly support People's China's peaceful policies. Like other socialist countries, we will always support People's China's legitimate demands for a legitimate position in the United Nations and for the reunification of Taiwan, which is now groaning under the iron heel of the United States and its puppet Chiang Kai-shek, with the People's Republic of China, because Taiwan is its inalienable territory. It is now time for Chiang Kai-shek to get out of the United Nations and Taiwan!
    The Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of its Leninist and battle-hardened Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, is good at applying the universal experience of the glorious Soviet Communist Party to the specific conditions of China, and confidently guides the 650 million great Chinese people along the road of socialism. The Chinese Communist Party faithfully and unswervingly defends the invincible ideology of Marxism-Leninism, protects it from the malicious attacks of opportunism and all kinds of revisionism, and has made valuable contributions to exposing the loyal servants of imperialism and the enemies of Marxism-Leninism, the Yugoslav revisionists. Glory belongs to the organizer and inspirer of all the victories of the great Chinese people, the firm and unyielding fighter for the victory of Marxism-Leninism - the heroic Chinese Communist Party!
    Dear comrades!
    Like you, our people are also on the eve of a great festival - the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the motherland. On November 29 this year, we will summarize the victories achieved by our people's power in the past 15 years. The road our people have traveled under the leadership of our Labor Party is a road of revolutionary transformation of all aspects of our lives. Today, the industrial production of our People's Republic has increased seventeen times compared with the pre-war period, agricultural collectivization is proceeding smoothly, and agricultural production has increased by more than double compared with the pre-war period. During this period, a real cultural revolution has taken place in our country, and the welfare of the people is constantly improving. We are building socialism in the southwest corner of the socialist camp, in a place not connected to the territory of the socialist camp countries. We started building socialism under conditions of serious economic and cultural backwardness; we are working under the conditions of constant pressure from imperialists and Yugoslav revisionists. It would be impossible to talk about building socialism in Albania without the great and generous assistance of the Soviet Union, People's China, and the countries of the socialist camp. Therefore, our people and party are forever grateful to the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp for the assistance they have given to our socialist construction in the past and today. If the internationalist unity of the countries of the socialist camp had not existed, and if our party had weakened its revolutionary vigilance against the consistent conspiracies of imperialists and revisionists, then Albania would not have existed as a socialist and independent country!
    In order to get rid of long-term backwardness and stand in the same ranks with the advanced countries of the socialist camp that have developed culture and economy, our people still need to make great efforts in the future. Our working people are successfully completing this task, because they are led by our Labor Party, because our people are hardworking people, and because we enjoy the help and fraternal support of the Soviet Union and all countries of the socialist camp on the road of socialist construction. I would like to especially point out the fact that the People's Republic of China, although it still has difficulties itself, has always generously assisted Albania's socialist construction. On this occasion, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people, the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government for the valuable assistance given to their little brothers in the socialist construction of the Albanian people.
    Although we are two extremes of the socialist camp in terms of geographical location and population, the historical development of our two countries - China and Albania - has many things in common. We are geographically far apart, but our hearts are beating together. The common struggle for freedom, the common road to socialism and communism, and the great friendship of the Soviet people, the leader of the great October Revolution and the socialist camp, unite us. Marxism-Leninism unites us. No force in the world can separate our hearts.
    The great Chinese people have the right to be proud of the tremendous and historic victories they have achieved. We also have the right to be proud of your brilliant achievements.
    Our powerful socialist camp is increasingly showing its vitality, and the people of our camp, united as one and headed by the Soviet Union, are increasingly clearly seeing the great prospects for a happy life. Today, when the Soviet Union is victoriously building communism, and Soviet space rockets have reached the moon, opening up a new era in the conquest of the universe, when the world's first atomic icebreaker named after the great Lenin has been built and set sail in the Soviet Union, and when all socialist countries are making astonishing achievements in their economic and cultural development - under such circumstances, the enthusiasm of our people is unprecedentedly high, and the prospects of our people are becoming clearer and clearer.
    The visit of our respected Comrade N.S. Khrushchev to the United States marks a further relaxation of international tensions, and this visit is not only a great victory for the Soviet Union, but also a great victory for the people of all countries in the cause of defending peace.
    Finally, please allow me to once again extend the warmest and fraternal congratulations on behalf of the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the government to the great and heroic Chinese people, the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Government, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. Dear comrades! We sincerely wish you greater victories in socialist construction, and wish you achievements and happiness in your work for People's China and the socialist camp.
    Long live the People's Republic of China and the great, heroic Chinese people!
    Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its Leninist central committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Albanian and Chinese people!
    Long live the powerful socialist camp headed by the glorious Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国
    部长会议主席、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国党政代表团团长
    穆·谢胡同志的贺词亲爱的同志们：
    在这中国革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立十周年的伟大节日的时候，请允许我代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，向你们，并通过你们向伟大的中国人民致以最热烈和深切的兄弟般的祝贺。中国革命的胜利有着非常重要的历史性的国际意义。在伟大的十月革命以后，中国革命的胜利是最重大的一个国际事件，因为它从几世纪以来的枷锁下解放了六亿人民，给予了帝国主义第二个沉重的和毁灭性的打击，并且成为亚洲各民族历史的新纪元的开始。这个历史性的胜利更加加强了以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营，使国际舞台上的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义而不利于帝国主义的变化。这个历史性的胜利是伟大的和英勇的中国人民，在光荣的中国共产党和中国人民的伟大儿子、我们尊敬的毛泽东同志的英明领导下，经过英勇的、长期的、流血的和错综复杂的斗争而取得的。
    中华人民共和国成立已经十年了，这在历史上是一个不算长的时期，但是这一时期证明了伟大中国人民的生命力和光荣，因为中国人民在这一期间，在自己国家的发展中实现了历史性的转折，这是中国的社会主义建设不断取得巨大成就的十年。工业的飞跃发展、农业在社会主义道路上的彻底改造，在这方面所取得的实际成就、你们伟大的国家在文化教育事业发展中所取得的巨大成就、人民政权的不断巩固、人民中国国际威信的不断提高，所有这一切都证明了马克思列宁主义战无不胜的力量，证明了中国人民的伟大力量，证明了中国人民在始终高举着马克思列宁主义的胜利旗帜的共产党周围团结一致。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民为伟大的和天才的中国人民所取得的光辉成就而感到无限高兴，并且像庆祝自己的节日一样，同社会主义阵营各国人民一起，共同欢庆你们的伟大节日。阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府衷心地祝伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设的道路上取得更大的成就；我们祝中国人民的伟大领袖，尊敬的毛泽东同志为了中国人民的幸福，为了社会主义和共产主义的胜利，像阿尔巴尼亚的群山一样万寿无疆。
    十年来，你们以自己的忘我劳动，在伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家的慷慨无私的帮助下，改变了你们伟大祖国的面貌，现在正在沿着社会主义建设的大道大步前进。
    伟大的人民中国，同苏联、其他社会主义国家和爱好和平的各国一起，为了保卫世界和平而进行着坚定不移的斗争。人民中国已经成为社会主义与和平的强大堡垒，而且今天没有伟大人民中国的参加，一切国际重大问题都不能得到彻底的解决。阿尔巴尼亚政府始终支持并将永远坚决支持人民中国的和平政策。正如其他社会主义国家一样，我们将永远支持人民中国的合法要求，即在联合国中取得合法的地位和把今天正呻吟在美国及其傀儡蒋介石的铁蹄下的台湾同中华人民共和国统一起来，因为台湾是它的不可分割的领土。现在已经是蒋介石滚出联合国和台湾的时候了！
    中国共产党，在它的以毛泽东同志为首的列宁主义式的久经斗争锻炼的中央委员会的领导下，善于在中国的具体条件下运用光荣的苏联共产党的具有普遍性的经验，满怀信心地引导着六亿五千万伟大的中国人民沿着社会主义的道路前进。中国共产党忠心耿耿、始终不渝地保卫着无往不胜的马克思列宁主义思想，使它免受机会主义和形形色色的修正主义的恶毒攻击，并对揭露帝国主义的忠诚奴仆和马克思列宁主义的敌人南斯拉夫修正主义者作出了宝贵的贡献。光荣属于伟大中国人民的一切胜利的组织者和鼓舞者、为马克思列宁主义的胜利而斗争的坚定不移和不屈不挠的战士——英勇的中国共产党！
    亲爱的同志们！
    正像你们一样，我国人民也正处在一个伟大的节日——祖国解放十五周年的前夕。今年11月29日，我们将总结我国人民政权十五年来所取得的胜利。我国人民在我们劳动党的领导下所经历的道路，是对我们生活的各个方面进行革命改造的道路。今天，我们人民共和国的工业生产比战前增长了十七倍，农业集体化正在顺利地进行，并且农业生产比战前增长了一倍多。在这一期间，我们国内发生了真正的文化革命，人民的福利也正在不断改善。我们在社会主义阵营的西南角，在同社会主义阵营各国的领土不相衔接的地方进行着社会主义建设。我们是在经济和文化严重落后的情况下开始进行社会主义建设的；我们是在帝国主义者和南斯拉夫修正主义者不断对我们施以压力的条件下进行劳动的。如果没有苏联、人民中国和社会主义阵营各国的巨大和慷慨的援助，就谈不上在阿尔巴尼亚建设社会主义。因此我国人民和党永远感激苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国在过去和今天对我国的社会主义建设所给予的援助。假如没有社会主义阵营各国的国际主义的团结，假如我们的党对帝国主义者和修正主义者一贯的阴谋诡计削弱了革命警惕性，那么阿尔巴尼亚早就不会作为社会主义和独立的国家而存在了！
    为了摆脱长期的落后，同有着发达的文化和经济的社会主义阵营先进各国一起站在一个行列中，我国人民在今后还需要进行巨大的努力。我国劳动人民正在顺利地完成着这个任务，因为领导他们的是我们的劳动党，因为我国人民是勤劳的人民，因为在社会主义建设的道路上我们享有苏联和社会主义阵营所有国家的帮助和兄弟般的支持。我想特别指出这样一个事实：中华人民共和国虽然自己还有困难，但却始终慷慨地援助阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设。借这个机会，我衷心地感谢兄弟般的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和人民政府在阿尔巴尼亚人民的社会主义建设中，给予他们的小兄弟的宝贵援助。
    尽管在地理位置上和人口上，我们是社会主义阵营的两个极端，但是我们两国——中国和阿尔巴尼亚——的历史发展有着很多的共同之处。我们在地理上相距遥远，但是我们的心是在一起跳动。为自由而进行的共同斗争、通向社会主义和共产主义的共同道路、伟大的十月革命与社会主义阵营的领导者——苏联人民的伟大友谊把我们团结在一起。马克思——列宁主义把我们团结在一起。世界上没有任何力量能够分离我们的心。
    伟大的中国人民有权利为他们已经取得的巨大的具有历史意义的胜利而骄傲。我们也有权利为你们的光辉成就而骄傲。
    我们强大的社会主义阵营正日益显示出它的生命力，以苏联为首的团结一致的我们阵营的各国人民日益清楚地看到幸福生活的伟大远景。今天，当着苏联正在胜利地建设共产主义，苏联宇宙火箭已经到达了月球，从而在征服宇宙方面开辟了一个新的时代，当着以伟大列宁的名字命名的世界第一艘原子破冰船已经在苏联建成启航，当着所有社会主义国家正在它们的经济和文化发展中取得惊人成就的时候——在这样的形势下，我们各国人民的热情空前高涨，我们各国人民的远景愈益显明。
    我们尊敬的尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的访问美国，标志着国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，这次访问不仅是苏联的巨大胜利，而且是世界各国人民在保卫和平事业中的一个巨大胜利。
    最后，请允许我再一次代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府，向伟大和英勇的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党、中国人民政府和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志致以最热烈和兄弟般的祝贺。亲爱的同志们！我们衷心地祝你们在社会主义建设中取得更大的胜利，祝你们在为了人民中国和社会主义阵营的劳动中取得成就和幸福。
    中华人民共和国和伟大、英勇的中国人民万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的列宁主义的中央委员会万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民之间的永恒的和牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以光荣的苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
