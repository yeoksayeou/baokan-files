Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, 15th: The so-called "United Nations Special Subcommittee to Investigate the Situation in Laos," illegally established under the manipulation of the United States, has hurriedly arrived in Vientiane, the capital of the Kingdom of Laos, today.

The chairman of this fifteen-member so-called "Special Subcommittee" is Shibusawa Shinichi, the Japanese representative, and the Secretary-General is an American named Blickenstaff. Other main members include Bourguiba, the representative of Tunisia, Baratieri, the representative of Italy, and Arhens, the representative of Argentina.

It is reported that this so-called "Special Subcommittee" intends to conduct activities in the Sam Neua area of northern Laos. At the same time, there are reports that the United States also intends to take advantage of providing "logistical support" to this committee to transport American transportation and communication equipment into Laos. American officials in Washington said on the 13th that the United States may provide the committee with helicopters, radios, and other equipment to accelerate its investigation work.

As previously reported, this so-called "Special Subcommittee" was illegally established by the Security Council despite the firm opposition of the Soviet Union, a permanent member. This practice of the Security Council not only violates the Geneva Accords, but also violates the United Nations Charter and the Security Council's Rules of Procedure, and has therefore been unanimously condemned by peace-loving people around the world.

    所谓“联合国专门小组委员会”
    匆匆赶到老挝进行活动
    新华社15日讯　万象消息：在美国操纵下非法建立的所谓“联合国调查老挝局势专门小组委员会”已在今天匆匆忙忙赶到老挝王国首都万象。
    这个由十五人组成的所谓“专门小组委员会”的主席是日本代表涩泽信一，秘书长是美国人布利肯斯塔夫。其它主要成员有：突尼斯的代表布尔吉巴、意大利代表巴拉蒂埃里和阿根廷代表阿伦斯。
    据报道，这个所谓“专门小组委员会”打算去老挝北部的桑怒一带进行活动。同时，有消息透露，美国还打算利用向这个委员会提供“后勤支援”的名义，把美国运输联络设备运入老挝。华盛顿的美国官员13日说，美国可能向这个委员会提供直升飞机、无线电和其他设备，以加速它的调查工作。
    前已报道，这个所谓的“专门小组委员会”是安全理事会在常任理事国苏联坚决反对的情况下非法决定建立的。安全理事会的这一做法不仅违反了日内瓦协议，而且也违反了联合国宪章和安理会议事规程，因此遭到了全世界爱好和平的人民的一致谴责。（附图片）
