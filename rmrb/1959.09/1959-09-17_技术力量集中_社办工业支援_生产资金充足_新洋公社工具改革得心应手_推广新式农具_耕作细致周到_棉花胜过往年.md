    This newspaper reports that the Xinyang People's Commune in Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, is actively implementing tool reforms, saving a large amount of labor, overcoming the shortcomings of extensive cultivation in cotton production in the past. This year, cotton seedlings are growing the best in the county, fully demonstrating the superiority of the People's Commune.

    The Xinyang People's Commune is located on the coast of the Yellow Sea, with a large area of ​​land but a small population. On average, each worker has to bear 11.7 mu of land. During the advanced agricultural cooperative period, labor shortage had become the main contradiction in production. The labor force is most strained during the annual spring sowing, and it takes more than 30 days to sow thousands of mu of cotton fields. If there is continuous spring rain, the sowing time will be longer. Labor shortage not only affects the quality of sowing, but also affects field management after sowing. For example, using manual weeding, each person can only weed seven or eight fen of land per day, and a little carelessness will cause weed infestation. In 1957, Chaoyang Advanced Cooperative failed to weed in time, and 2,000 mu of cotton fields suffered serious weed infestation. Before communization, some tool reforms were carried out here, which aroused great interest. However, these reforms and the use of new tools were not yet widespread.

    Before spring sowing this year, the commune party committee conscientiously summarized the experience of last year's tool reform, and implemented a method combining professional teams and large-scale mass movements to carry out the tool reform movement in a guided manner. Forty days before cotton sowing, they focused on the manufacturing of sowing machinery. The commune manufactured a total of 65 four-row or five-row strip planters, repaired 149 single-row and double-row planters, modified 624 three-tine weeder ditchers, and 125 seed spreaders, completely changing the backward state of manual operation during cotton sowing. Generally, single-row and double-row planters can sow 20 to 25 mu per day, which is 10 to 30 times more efficient than manual labor. Because sowing was timely, the depth of sowing was consistent, and the soil was compacted after sowing, the cotton seedlings emerged early and neatly. Last year, some advanced cooperatives generally used three-tine weeders for weeding, which accelerated the weeding speed, but they still felt that the efficiency was not high enough. This year, when weeding cotton fields, the staff of the commune-run machinery repair factory trial-produced 13 different types of weeding machines. After on-site trial use and improvement, they were basically suitable. In one month, the entire commune produced 263 weeding machines and repaired more than 400 old-style three-tine weeders. The commune's 5,000 mu of cotton fields had an average of one weeding machine for every 70 mu of land, and could complete one weeding in five to six days, with very high weeding quality.

    Major reforms have also been made in tools for topdressing and pest control. Topdressing is the most arduous task in cotton production. In the past, topdressing required three processes: ditching, fertilizing, and covering the soil. On average, each person could only do three or four fen of land per day. In order to solve the shortage of labor for topdressing, this cooperative tried to refit three-tine weeders last year, which could continuously carry out ditching, topdressing, and hilling, and three people could topdress 20 mu per day. This year, the commune refitted 284 of these weeders, greatly accelerating the progress of topdressing.

    In terms of pest control, single-tube sprayers were modified into multi-head sprayers, which not only greatly saved labor, but also accelerated the progress of pest control. At present, the modification of more than 800 single-tube sprayers in the commune has been basically completed. This type of sprayer can generally increase efficiency by more than one time. Up to now, the commune has achieved mechanization of sowing, weederization of inter-row cultivation and weeding, vehicularization of topdressing, and multi-headization of sprayers for pest control. Due to the large-scale tool reform, the commune has created, reformed, and imitated 32 kinds of large and small tools, totaling more than 5,700 pieces. In the 90 days of this summer, more than 380,000 labor days were saved, which is equivalent to an increase of 4,300 labor days per day.

    The tool reform movement of the Xinyang Commune has achieved great success, once again proving the great superiority of the People's Commune. The positive role played by communization in promoting tool reform is specifically manifested in the following aspects: (1) In terms of technical strength, before communization, the Chaoyang Advanced Cooperative only had one pot mender, and it was necessary to travel more than ten li to find blacksmiths and carpenters to repair agricultural tools. After communization, the scale of the commune became larger, which made it easier to uniformly organize all technical forces into professional teams for tool reform, and this contradiction was basically resolved. (2) After communization, there were commune-run industries. The commune ran an iron and wood factory and five repair stations, and each production brigade ran a small agricultural tool factory. Some people manufactured daily-use agricultural tools, while others specialized in the research and trial production of new tools. The students of the commune's agricultural middle school also created and modified more than a dozen tools in their spare time. (3) Due to communization, unified leadership was implemented, and the problem of funds was also solved. Over the past year, the commune has taken out 10,000 yuan as a tool reform fund, which would have been difficult to do in the advanced cooperative period.

    新洋公社工具改革得心应手
    推广新式农具　耕作细致周到　棉花胜过往年
    本报讯　江苏射阳县新洋人民公社积极实行工具改革，节省出大量劳力，克服了以往棉花生产上耕作粗放的缺点，今年棉苗长势跃居全县第一，充分显示了人民公社的优越性。
    新洋人民公社位于黄海之滨，田多人少，平均每个劳力要负担十一亩七分地。在高级农业社的时候，劳力不足已经成为生产上的主要矛盾。每年春播时劳力最紧张，播种几千亩棉田需要三十多天。如果遇到连绵春雨，播种时间拖得更长。劳力不足不仅影响播种质量，也影响播种以后的田间管理。例如，用人工锄草，每人每天只能锄七、八分地，稍一疏忽就形成了草荒。1957年朝阳高级社锄草不及时，有二千亩棉田发生严重草荒。公社化以前，这里曾经进行过某些工具改革，引起了人们极大的兴趣。但是这些改革和新工具的使用都还不普遍。
    今年春播之前，公社党委认真总结了去年工具改革的经验，实行了专业队和大搞群众运动相结合的方法，有领导地开展了工具改革运动。在棉花播种前四十天，就狠抓了播种机具的制造。全社共制造了四行或五行条播机六十五台，修理了单、双行播种机一百四十九台，改制三齿耘锄开沟器六百二十四把，撒种器一百二十五件，在棉花播种时彻底改变了人工操作的落后状态。一般单、双行播种机，日播二十到二十五亩，比人工提高工效十到三十倍。由于播种及时，下种深浅一致，播后压实，棉花出苗又早又整齐。去年有些高级社普遍使用三齿耘锄锄草，加快了锄草速度，但仍感到工效不够高。今年开始棉田锄草时，公社办的机械修配厂的职工试制了十三种不同样的锄草机，经过现场试用改进，基本合用。一个月时间，全公社即制出锄草机二百六十三架，整修了旧式三齿耘锄四百多架，全公社五千亩棉田，平均七十亩田就有一部锄草机，五至六天即可完成中耕锄草一遍，而且锄草质量很高。
    在追肥、治虫工具方面也作了重大改革。追肥是棉花生产上最繁重的一项劳动。过去追肥，开沟、浇肥、盖土三道工序，平均每人每天只搞三、四分地。为了解决追肥劳力不足，去年这个社试用改装三齿耘锄，可以连续进行开沟、追肥、壅土，每天三人可追二十亩。今年公社改装了这种耘锄二百八十四部，大大加快了追肥的进度。
    治虫方面，改装单管喷雾器为多头喷雾器，不仅大大节省劳力，而且加快了治虫进度，目前全社八百多架单管喷雾器已基本改装结束，这种喷雾器一般可提高工效一倍以上。至此，这个公社已经做到播种机具化、中耕锄草耘锄化、追肥车子化、治虫喷药的喷雾器多头化。由于大搞工具改革，全社已创造、改革、仿制大小工具三十二种，五千七百余件。在今年夏季九十天中，就节省三十八万多个劳力，等于每天增加了四千三百个劳动力。
    新洋公社的工具改革运动，取得了重大成就，再一次证明了人民公社有着巨大的优越性。公社化对于促进工具改革所起的积极作用，具体表现在以下几个方面：（1）在技术力量方面，公社化之前，朝阳高级社只有一个补锅匠，修理农具要跑十多里路去找铁匠、木匠。公社化以后，社的规模大了，便于统一组织所有技术力量成为工具改革专业队，这个矛盾就基本解决了。（2）公社化以后，有了社办工业。公社办了一个铁木工厂、五个修配站，各个生产大队办了小型农具厂，有一部分人制造日常应用农具，另一部分人专门从事新工具的研究试制工作。公社的农业中学的学生，也在课余时间创制和改制了十多种工具。（3）由于公社化，实行了统一领导，资金问题也得到了解决。一年来公社已拿出一万元作为工具改革的基金，这在高级社时是难以办到的。
