    Pengpu Commune: Using Modern Tools to Develop Non-Staple Food Production

    (Our Newspaper News) Since the establishment of the Pengpu People's Commune in Baoshan County, Shanghai, it has done many things that the advanced cooperatives could not do, making the scale of non-staple food production increasingly larger.

    As soon as the commune was established, it widely carried out large-scale cooperation between production teams, which made many places realize garden-style and grid-style layouts, basically eliminating the phenomenon of uneven land, drought, and flood, and vegetable production has increased significantly. The average yield per mu of the entire commune has increased by 75.7% compared with the peak of the cooperativization movement. From January to June this year, the amount of vegetables on the market reached more than 530,000 dan, an increase of 31.2% over the same period last year, with an average of more than 2,900 dan on the market every day. Because the planning nature of production has been strengthened, it has gradually achieved evergreen throughout the four seasons, balanced supply, and has rationally arranged funds and labor to build mushroom sheds, glass greenhouses, etc. to cultivate various vegetables. The variety of vegetables has expanded from the original 149 kinds to 195 kinds, and many rare varieties at home and abroad, such as asparagus, horseradish, and beetroot, have also "settled" here.

    In animal husbandry production, due to the large-scale expansion of breeding bases, six new breeding farms have been opened, the largest of which can raise more than 500 strong pigs. In the three newly added poultry farms, there are three sets of electric incubation equipment, the largest of which can incubate 27,800 chicks at a time. This has made the great development of livestock and poultry more favorable conditions. According to recent statistics, from January to July, 3,900 heads were supplied to the market, equivalent to the total amount on the market last year. Chickens and ducks are everywhere in the commune, seven times more than last year. Nearly 200 mu of water surface has been stocked with 160,000 freshwater fish, more than double the amount last year.

    With the development of production, public accumulation has greatly increased, and therefore, many modern production tools have been added, which has brought great convenience to production. In this year, the number of tractors increased from four to nineteen, the number of cars increased from three to six, the number of water pumps increased from seven to forty-five, and an artificial rainfall station and twenty rainfall machines played a greater role. Mechanization has reduced heavy physical labor and can free up more labor to comprehensively strengthen production management. Before communization, the vegetables produced in this area were delivered to the city by hundreds of farmers every day by bicycle and tricycle; now, 2,000 to 3,000 dan of vegetables are transported by car every day, which greatly saves labor.

    Due to the rapid development of production, the income of farmers in this commune has also been steadily increasing, and the entire rural life has undergone significant changes. In the first half of this year, the average income per household reached 359 yuan, an increase of 24% over the same period last year, which has generally exceeded the living standards of local wealthy middle peasants. At the same time, a large number of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries have been established, and two new farmers' villages have been built, and 70 households have moved into bright and clean buildings with plenty of sunlight.

    Xinmin Commune: One-Third of its Products are Supplied to Meet the Needs of the State as Commodities

    (Our Newspaper News) Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery in the Xinmin People's Commune of Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, have been comprehensively developed. In the first half of 1959, the total output value of this commune increased by nearly one time compared with the same period before the establishment of the commune. In addition to ensuring self-sufficiency, one-third of the products produced by the commune are supplied to meet the needs of the state and the market as commodities.

    This year, Xinmin Commune's summer crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and early rice have achieved unprecedented harvests. The total wheat output of the entire commune reached more than 1.58 million jin, an increase of more than 80% over last year. The wheat sold by the commune increased more than four times over last year, and the rapeseed sold to the state also increased by more than 30,000 jin over last year. In August this year, although this commune encountered a rare catastrophic flood in the past decade, thanks to the concerted efforts of the entire commune to build and repair dikes and embankments day and night, they finally overcame the flood and ensured a good harvest of rice. At present, the mid-season rice in this commune is also growing more luxuriantly than in previous years and is about to be harvested.

    For a long time, there has been a view that the western Sichuan Plain is only suitable for engaging in a single agricultural economy and is not suitable for establishing industry. However, before communization, the advanced cooperatives had already established some small factories and workshops. After the establishment of the commune, under the guidance of the policy of combining industry, agriculture, and commerce, it organized a great leap forward in agriculture and developed commune-run industry. At present, the entire commune has established more than 200 factories and workshops of various sizes. In the first half of the year, the total output value reached more than 150,000 yuan, an increase of nearly one time compared with the same period last year. The commune is now not only able to make most of its own farm tools, pesticides, and local fertilizers, but also has some parts transferred to other places as commodities to supply the needs of the market. More than 116 tons of solidified calcium phosphate and bacterial fertilizer alone. In the first half of the year, the commune's brick and tile factory produced more than 2 million bricks and tiles, of which 1.6 million were used for urban capital construction. The commune's brewery used the surplus vegetables during the peak season to process more than 5,000 yuan worth of pickled vegetables to supply other places. With the development of the commune's industry, the commune's power stations, grinding mills, clothing factories, and pottery factories have also accepted a large number of national processing tasks.

    In the past year, with the development of the commune's diversified economy, the amount of commodities supplied by the commune to the market has continued to increase. Now, the number of diversified economic projects operated by the commune has expanded from 10 to more than 30, accounting for 30% of the commune's total income. According to statistics, compared with the same period last year, the commodity volume of major products in the first half of this year increased by 39% for vegetables, 26.5% for live pigs, 230% for small poultry and livestock, and about one-quarter for handicrafts. At the same time, the commune has also actively arranged for local traditional economic crops such as hemp, tobacco, and medicinal materials in accordance with national plans. Weaving brown silk, weaving mats, and planting medicinal materials are the main sideline occupations in the local area. In the past, the advanced cooperatives believed that the investment was large and the income was small, and they were unwilling to develop them. This year, the commune improved its management and adopted the method of "calculating both small accounts and large accounts" to organize the production of its members. In July alone, the entire commune produced more than 1,700 yuan worth of brown silk products, hairnets, fans, bamboo utensils, and other handicrafts. In the activities of vigorously developing a diversified economy, the entire commune also actively developed private sideline occupations for its members in accordance with the principle of combining public and private, and encouraged members to use the corners of the fields to "seize every opportunity" to produce vegetables and melons, and raise chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits. Since July, the products sold by members to the market have been worth more than 7,000 yuan per month.

    With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the commune's public accumulation and basic construction have also increased greatly. In less than a year, the public accumulation in the commune has more than doubled compared with last year. Not only did it repay more than 100,000 yuan of state loans, but it also accumulated more than 2.9 million yuan of public accumulation to expand industrial and agricultural production. In the past, advanced cooperatives had been eager for cars and tractors for many years, but due to the small size of the commune and limited income, they were unable to purchase them. After the establishment of the commune, it concentrated the previously dispersed funds for use. Recently, it purchased a new truck, three tractors, and a movie projector, and also added five lathes to the commune's iron factory. At the same time, the commune also built a residential building, installed telephones in each management area of the entire commune, and installed wired broadcasting in each production team. The commune also allocated a large amount of funds from commodity income for culture, education, health, and welfare. The commune has established a total of 50 kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and red and expert schools. In addition, it has also established hospitals, maternity hospitals, and health stations. (Fan Zhixuan)

    Yunxi Commune: Agricultural and Commercial Departments Cooperate to Plan Commodity Production

    (Our Newspaper News) The close cooperation between agriculture and commerce in the Yunxi People's Commune in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, has vigorously promoted the rapid development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. The early rice in this commune increased by more than 10% compared with last year, and a bumper harvest of mid-season rice is in sight. The planting area of cash crops has also increased by 86% compared with last year; family sideline occupations have developed from 105 kinds last year to 140 kinds; and live pigs have increased by 4.6% compared with last year.

    Under the unified leadership of the Yunxi Commune Party Committee, it gives full play to the characteristics of commercial departments being familiar with commodity and market needs, and unifies the planning of various commodity production. For example, according to the suggestions of the commercial department, the commune expanded the number of cash crop projects from 45 to 78 this year, and gave priority to developing those urgently needed for the national economy and the people's livelihood; the proportion of commodity production in the entire commune has also greatly increased compared with the originally planned figures; and commodity production bases for cotton, sugarcane, medicinal materials, vegetables, and non-staple food raw materials have been established in accordance with local conditions. This makes commodity production conform to the actual situation in terms of both quantity and variety, so that large-profit and small-profit, large-scale and sporadic can be coordinated and comprehensively developed. In order to complete the state's procurement tasks, this commune has implemented three types of contracts: annual procurement contracts for bulk commodities; seasonal procurement contracts for small local specialties; and contracts for meeting production and sales.

    彭浦公社：使用现代化工具，发展副食品生产
    本报讯　上海市宝山县彭浦人民公社成立以后，做了许多高级社时无法办到的事情，使副食品生产的规模日益扩大。
    公社一建立，就广泛开展了生产队之间的大协作，使许多地方实现了园田化、格子化，基本上消除了土地高低不平、旱涝不均的现象，蔬菜生产有显著的增加，全社平均亩产量比合作化高潮时增长75.7％。今年1至6月份，蔬菜上市量达五十三万多担，比去年同期增加31.2％，平均每天上市二千九百多担。由于生产计划性加强了，逐步做到四季常青，均衡供应，并且合理安排了资金和劳力，建造了蘑菇棚、玻璃温室等来培植各种蔬菜。蔬菜的品种从原有的一百四十九种扩大到一百九十五种，国内外许多稀有品种如芦笋、辣根、红菜头等也都已在这里“安家落户”了。
    在畜牧生产上，也由于大规模地扩充了饲养基地，新辟饲养场六处，最大的一处就可养壮猪五百多头；在增设的三处家禽饲养场里，置有电气孵化设备三套，最大的孵化设备一次可孵苗禽二万七千八百只。这使家畜家禽的大发展，具备了更为有利的条件。据最近统计，1至7月份，供应市场三千九百头，相当于去年全年上市量。全社鸡鸭到处成群，比去年增加七倍。在将近二百亩的水面上，已经放养淡水鱼十六万尾，比去年增加一倍以上。
    随着生产的发展，公共积累有了很大的增长，因之添置了许多近代化的生产工具，给生产带来很大便利。在这一年中，拖拉机从四台增加到十九台，汽车从三辆增加到六辆，抽水机从七架增加到四十五架，一处人工降雨站和二十架降雨机发挥了更大的威力。机械化减轻了笨重的体力劳动，可以腾出更多的劳动力来全面地加强生产管理。公社化前，这个地区出产的蔬菜每天都由成百个农民用脚踏车、三轮拖车送到城市；现在每天二、三千担蔬菜全部用汽车运输，大大节省了劳动力。
    由于生产的迅速发展，这个公社的农民收入也得到了稳定增长，农村整个生活起了显著变化。今年上半年平均每户收入达到三百五十九元，比去年同期增长24％，已经普遍超过了当地富裕中农生活水平。同时，兴办了大量的公共食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业，兴建了二处农民新村，已有七十户人家搬进了阳光充足、窗明几净的楼房。
    新民公社：三分之一的产品作为商品供应国家需要
    本报讯　四川新繁县新民人民公社农林牧副渔获得全面发展。1959年上半年，这个公社生产总值比公社成立前同期增加将近一倍，公社生产的产品除了保证自给以外，还有三分之一作为商品供应给国家和市场的需要。
    今年新民公社的小麦、油菜、早稻等夏季作物获得空前丰收。全社小麦总产量达一百五十八万多斤，比去年增加80％以上；公社缴售的小麦比去年增加四倍以上，卖给国家的油菜籽也比去年增加三万多斤。今年8月，这个公社虽然遇到十年来少有的特大洪水，由于全社同心协力日夜修堤修堰，终于战胜洪水，保证了水稻丰收。目前，这个公社的中稻也比往年长得茂盛，即将开镰收割。
    长期以来，有这样一种论调：川西平原只适宜于搞单一的农业经济，不适宜兴办工业。但是在公社化以前，各高级社就开办了一些小型工厂和作坊。公社成立后，在工农商并举的方针指导下，一面组织农业大跃进，一面发展社办工业。目前，全社已办起大小工厂、作坊二百多个。上半年，总产值达十五万多元，比去年同期上升近一倍。公社现在不仅作到大部农具、农药、土化肥等自足，而且还有部分作为商品调往外地供应市场需要，仅固磷酸钙、细菌肥等就有一百一十六吨多。上半年公社砖瓦厂共生产砖瓦二百多万片，其中有一百六十万片是供城市基本建设需用。公社酿造厂利用旺季多余的蔬菜，加工了价值五千多元的酱腌菜供应外地。随着公社工业的发展，公社的电站、碾房、被服厂、陶器厂也都大量接受国家加工的任务。
    一年来随着公社多种经济的发展，公社给市场提供的商品量不断增长。现在，公社经营的多种经济项目已从十种扩大到三十多种，占全社总收入的30％。据统计，今年上半年主要产品的商品量和去年同期比较，蔬菜增加39％，生猪增加26.5％，小家禽家畜上升230％，手工业产品比去年增加四分之一左右。同时，公社对当地传统的经济作物，如麻、烟、药材也都按照国家计划，主动作了安排。编棕丝、织席、种药材是当地主要副业，过去高级社时认为投资大、收入小不愿发展，今年公社改进经营管理，采取“既算小账，也算大账”的办法，组织社员生产。仅7月份，全公社就生产了价值一千七百多元的棕丝制品、发网、扇子、篾器等手工业品。在大搞多种经济的活动中，全公社还根据公私并举的方针，积极发展社员私人副业，鼓励社员利用田边地角“见缝插针”，生产蔬菜、瓜果，饲养鸡鸭鹅兔，7月份以来，社员每月向市场出售的产品就有七千多元。
    随着工农业生产的发展，公社的公共积累和基本建设也有巨大增长。不到一年，社里的公共积累比去年增加一倍以上。不仅归还了十万多元国家贷款，还积存二百九十多万元的公共积累，用以扩大工农业生产。过去高级社渴望了多年的汽车、拖拉机，由于社小、收入有限，无力购置。公社建立后，把过去分散的资金集中使用，最近新购买了一辆载重汽车、三台拖拉机、一部电影放映机，还为公社铁工厂添置了五台车床。同时，公社还修建了一座居民大楼，在全社各管理区装置了电话，每个生产队架设了有线广播。公社还从商品收入中拨出大量款项，用在文化、教育、卫生、福利等方面。公社办了幼儿园、中小学校、红专学校共五十所，另外还设立了医院、产妇院、保健站。　（范知眭）
    云溪公社：农业商业部门协作规划商品生产
    本报讯　湖南省临湘县云溪人民公社农商密切协作，有力地促进了农林牧副渔的迅速发展。这个公社早稻比去年增产一成以上，中稻丰收在望。经济作物播种面积也比去年增加了86％；家庭副业已由去年的一百零五种发展到一百四十种；生猪比去年增长了4.6％。
    云溪公社在公社党委统一领导下，充分发挥商业部门熟悉商品和市场需要的特点，统一规划各项商品生产。例如公社根据商业部门的建议，在今年就把经济作物的项目由四十五项扩大到七十八项，而且优先发展国计民生迫切需要的；全社商品生产所占的比例，也比原订的数字大大增加了；还因地制宜建立棉花、甘蔗、药材、蔬菜和副食品原料等商品生生基地。这就使商品生产无论在数量上、品种上都符合了实际情况，使收益大与收益小的、大宗的与零星的都能够互相配合、全面发展。为了完成国家的采购任务，这个公社推行了三种合同：大宗商品常年采购合同；小土特产的季节性采购合同；产销见面合同。
