Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: Our reporter reports: The eight heroic football teams that participated in the first stage of the First National Games football finals in Tianjin arrived in Beijing today. They will join forces with the four strong teams originally competing in Beijing to prepare for the second stage of the finals, which will begin on September 10. In the second stage of the finals, Hebei, the People's Liberation Army, Guangdong, Liaoning, Beijing, and Shaanxi will compete in a round-robin tournament to vie for the top six places; Jilin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shanghai, Hubei, and Jiangsu will compete in a round-robin tournament to vie for seventh to twelfth place.

These twelve excellent football teams from all over the country have already held the first stage of round-robin matches in three groups before September 7, with a total of eighteen fierce battles. Whether it was the first group in Beijing or the second and third groups in Tianjin, the games were exciting, earning praise from more than 100,000 spectators in Beijing and Tianjin. The intensity and enthusiasm on the field can also be seen from the gradual leveling of the strength of the teams. In the eighteen matches, draws and matches decided by only one goal each accounted for four games, accounting for 44% of all matches in the first stage. Matches with a difference of two goals accounted for six games, accounting for 33% of all matches. Only in the match where Shanghai lost to Guangdong by one to five was the score difference larger. In the first stage of the competition, no team was able to win all its matches. The Hebei team and the People's Liberation Army team, both renowned domestically, drew, each achieving two wins and one draw in three matches, showing that the two teams were evenly matched. However, both teams had considerable difficulty winning against the Jilin team. Only the Heilongjiang team lost all three matches, and only the Jilin and Jiangsu teams lost two matches. In addition, teams with equal points appeared in each group, and only the results of the matches between these two teams in the same group or the goal difference could determine the ranking. All of the above shows that the skills of these twelve excellent football teams from all over our country have generally improved. In addition, most players can muster their energy and demonstrate their brave and tenacious spirit, so victories are often decided by a narrow margin, and there are rarely scenes of "overwhelming advantage" or "easy victory."

What is particularly noteworthy is that in the first stage of the football finals, some previously weak teams defeated previously strong teams, and newcomers defeated famous players. Among the champions of the four competition zones in the regional preliminary rounds in May and June, only Hebei and Guangdong teams can now enter the competition for the top six places. Jilin and Hubei teams have not been able to "advance" and are ranked in the competition for seventh to twelfth places. The Shanghai team, the runner-up in the Tianjin competition zone and a甲级team in 1958, also failed to "advance." Among them, in addition to the Jilin team encountering two strong teams, Hebei and the People's Liberation Army, the Shanghai and Hubei teams lost their "advancement" opportunities because they were defeated by the young Guangdong and Shaanxi teams, respectively.

The new wave pushes the old wave, which shows the growth of new forces in China's football movement and the leap-forward development of football technology. The Guangdong team, a乙级team last year, defeated the Liaoning team, the runner-up in last year's甲级league with eleven athletes, by a score of four to two in this competition. Then, riding on the momentum, they defeated the Shanghai team, which had participated in many international competitions, had a fairly complete lineup, and was rich in on-the-spot experience.

The Shaanxi team was formed after the first Shaanxi Provincial Games in October last year. It has been less than a year since its establishment. Only second and third-level athletes are in the team, and three players have not yet obtained the title of graded athlete. However, they are good at learning humbly and summing up experience. This young team defeated the quite strong Hubei team and the young and strong Jiangsu team with soaring enthusiasm, and finally won the right to participate in the competition for the top six places. If we connect with some previous situations, this point is even more noteworthy. In 1951, at the first National Football Competition Conference held in Tianjin after the founding of New China, the Northwest team lost six and won one. In all the defeated games, they did not kick a single goal into the opponent's goal. In 1953, at the National Youth Football Championship held in Shanghai, the Xi'an team also lost three games in three matches, with scores ranging from zero to four to zero to six. Now, the young players selected from the Shaanxi Provincial Games have created such excellent results. This shows that in Shaanxi, which was originally "backward" in football, there has been a leap-forward development in this sport in recent years, just like in many provinces and cities.

    后浪推前浪
    ——足球决赛第一阶段比赛述评
    新华社8日讯　本社记者报道：在天津参加了第一届全国运动会足球第一段决赛的八路雄师，今天开抵北京。他们与原在北京比赛的四支劲旅会师，准备迎接9月10日开始的第二段决赛。第二段决赛将由河北、解放军、广东、辽宁、北京、陕西六队举行循环赛争取前六名名次；由吉林、黑龙江、四川、上海、湖北、江苏六队举行循环赛争取第七至十二名名次。
    这十二个来自全国各地的优秀足球队，已经在9月7日前分成三组举行了第一段循环比赛，一共有十八场激战。不管是在北京的第一组或在天津的第二、三组，踢来场场精彩，使北京、天津十万以上的观众赞赏不已。球场上的紧张热烈，从各队实力的逐渐拉平也可以看出来。在十八场比赛中，踢成平局和只以一球之差而分胜负的各占四场，占了第一段全部比赛场数44％。比数相差两球的占了六场，占全部比赛场数33％。只有上海以一比五负于广东的一场，比数相差较大。而在第一段比赛中，没有一支队伍能够获得全胜，在国内享有盛誉的劲旅河北队和解放军队踢成平局，各取得三战两胜一平的战绩，显示了两队旗鼓相当。而这两队分别对吉林队之战，胜来都相当吃力。连败三场的只有黑龙江队，败两场的只有吉林、江苏两队。此外，每个组都出现了积分相等的队伍，只是根据这两个队在同组中互相间竞赛的胜负或净胜球的多少，才能决定名次。以上这些，都说明这十二个来自我国天南地北的优秀足球队伍，球技都普遍有了提高，加以大多数球员都能鼓足干劲和发挥勇敢顽强的精神，因此经常只能以微弱之差而决定胜负，很少出现“压倒优势”或“轻易取胜”的场面。
    尤其引起人们注意的是，第一段足球决赛中出现了一些原来的弱队战胜原来的强队，新手击败名将的事例。在5、6月间分区预赛时四个竞赛区的冠军中，现在只有河北、广东两队能进入争夺前六名名次的比赛，吉林、湖北两队都没有能“晋级”，而排到争夺第七到十二名的行列中。分区预赛时天津竞赛区亚军、1958年甲级队上海队也没有能够“晋级”。其中除了吉林队是由于在同组中遇到河北、解放军两支劲旅外，上海、湖北队都是由于分别被年轻的广东、陕西队击败而失去“晋级”机会。
    长江后浪推前浪，这说明了我国足球运动新生力量的成长和足球技术水平的跃进发展。后起之秀的广东队去年还是乙级队，在这次比赛中以四比二的优势，挫败了拥有十一名运动健将的去年甲级队联赛亚军辽宁队，再挟余威战胜曾参加过多次国际比赛、阵容相当整齐、临场经验丰富的上海队。
    陕西队是去年10月陕西全省第一届运动会结束后，才选拔球员组成的。成立至今不到一年，队里只有二、三级运动员，还有三人没有取得等级运动员的称号。但是，他们善于虚心学习，总结经验，这支年轻的队伍以冲天的干劲，击败了实力相当雄厚的湖北队和年青力壮的江苏队，终于取得参与争夺前六名名次的权利。如果联系以前的一些情况，这一点更是引人注意。1951年在天津举行新中国成立后的第一次全国足球比赛大会时，西北队六负一胜，失败的各场都是没有踢进对方一球。1953年在上海举行全国青年足球锦标赛，西安队也是三战三负，比数都是零比四到零比六。现在，由陕西全省运动会选拔出来的年轻选手们竟创造了这么优异的成绩。这说明了在原来足球运动“落后”的陕西，正像许多省、市一样，近年来在这个运动项目中有了跃进式的发展。
