Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 31st - Under the Party's call, the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province have rapidly mobilized and are determined to achieve a new leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year in response to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

In the emerging industrial city of Guiyang, workers and staff in factories and mines in iron and steel, coal, machinery, and capital construction are full of vigor and determined to seize every minute to complete the state plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. On the evening of the 26th, the rolling mill workshop of Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant held a mobilization meeting for the entire workshop and launched a competition between shifts and individuals. They guaranteed to complete the third quarter production task five days ahead of schedule, achieve a qualification rate of 92%, and reduce costs by 20% compared with the second quarter to respond to the Party's call. The entire workforce of the Lindong Coal Mine, whose raw coal output from January to July has already exceeded the total output of last year, is determined to complete the third quarter plan ten days ahead of schedule and overproduce 10,000 tons of raw coal to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

In Duyun City, the capital of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, an emerging industrial city that emerged during the Great Leap Forward, more than 10,000 workers and staff held a remobilization meeting on the 28th, and a number of factories and mines completed their August production tasks ahead of schedule that day. Duyun Iron and Steel Plant, the largest iron and steel joint enterprise in the minority areas of Guizhou Province, not only completed the pig iron production plan in quantity on the 28th, but also improved the quality of pig iron, reduced coke consumption, and increased the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace. Workers and staff of the Shuicheng Iron and Steel Plant held a mobilization meeting on the 26th. The next day, pig iron production reached 139 tons, setting a new record for the plant's daily output this year. The workers said they would use more and better steel to counter the imperialists' rumors and slanders against China's great achievements in the Great Leap Forward.

"The People's Commune is Good!" is the truth that the commune members of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas have personally experienced in the past year. When studying and discussing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they unanimously expressed that they would hold high the red flag of the people's commune and continue to advance. The Luowan People's Commune in the suburbs of Guiyang City, the first to be established in Guizhou Province, held a symposium on the evening of the 26th. Agricultural models, pumping station workers, tractor drivers, and commune cadres praised that the establishment of the commune for only one year has accomplished many things that were impossible in the past, such as basically realizing the motorization and road construction, using tractors to cultivate one-fifth of the land, and establishing middle schools, broadcasting stations, film teams, hospitals, and so on. Currently, more than 500 people's communes in the province are taking various measures under the encouragement of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to fight hard in September and seize greater harvests. Miao and Han commune members in Songtao Miao Autonomous County decided to launch a three-day assault to weed and water more than 40,000 mu of late rice, striving to harvest an extra 50 to 100 jin per mu. Seven people's communes in Huishui County have also launched a red flag competition movement centered on overcoming disasters and seizing bumper harvests, using greater leap forward achievements to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 31st - The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to strive to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year has greatly encouraged the Tibetan and Han workers and staff on the Tibetan Plateau. They are determined to further boost their energy and use more and better achievements to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

The workers and staff of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, who have undertaken heavy transportation tasks in recent years, are launching a socialist labor competition in response to the Party's call, striving to create new leap forward achievements in the last few months of this year. In the past few years, the workers and staff of this highway have built more than 50 small factories and mines along the highway while building the road, starting from scratch. In the first half of this year alone, these factories and mines produced tens of thousands of tons of products for the country, strongly supporting the construction along the highway. The workers said that they must continue to carry forward the spirit of "doing more things with less money, and doing things even without money," to create more wealth for the country and develop the plateau.

The automobile drivers, who are enthusiastically carrying out the "safety, conservation, and 10,000-ton-kilometer per vehicle per month" campaign, have expressed their determination to overcome the difficulties in plateau highway transportation by all means, load more, run faster, and overfulfill this year's transportation tasks. In the past three months of the plateau rainy season, the drivers of the first automobile team overcame mud and overfulfilled the predetermined transportation tasks, and also saved more than 9,000 liters of gasoline in August. They guaranteed to continue to overfulfill the higher volume indicators in the second half of the year and save 10,000 liters of gasoline per month to respond to the Party Central Committee's call to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy.

The workers and staff of the Lhasa Automobile Repair Plant organized a "Plant-wide Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee" and formulated a leap forward plan for the next few months of this year. In addition to ensuring the completion of the predetermined automobile repair tasks, they will also strive to trial-produce a small motorboat and 12 kinds of new products in September to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

In simple conditions, the "August 1st" Automobile Repair Plant, which smelted the first furnace of steel and trial-produced the first tractor on the plateau last year, is now even more energetic. They guarantee that in addition to completing the predetermined vehicle repair tasks, they will also build a batch of factory buildings and workshops before the National Day, and process a batch of machinery and tools for the new hydropower station in Lhasa.

When the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China came, more than 200 Tibetan and Han workers and staff of the Lhasa Agricultural Experimental Farm were beginning to harvest vegetables and grain crops. This year, the farm planted more than 1,000 mu of land, and harvested more than 5 million jin of vegetables alone. The 40 kinds of vegetables and grain crops that have been successfully trial-planted on the plateau in recent years have generally achieved bumper harvests after large-scale sowing this year. The workers and staff are determined to establish workshops for sugar production and other tasks before the National Day, make good use of the fruits of the bumper harvest, and welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
