Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The first National Games gymnastics competition has completed its first stage. More than 400 male and female athletes representing 28 units have completed the compulsory routines.

The compulsory routines used in this competition are the same as those used in the World Gymnastics Championships. The difficulty is quite high. The Shichahai Gymnasium is filled with youth and vitality. The athletes mostly performed the movements very well.

The results of the men's six events' compulsory routines competition show that the People's Liberation Army team, with its balanced strength, leads with 331.3 points. The Hebei team, the 1956 national champion and the runner-up in the 1959 National Master-Level competition, is in second place with 327.35 points. The team's famous athlete, Bao Naijian, leads the individual all-around with 56.6 points.

In the women's four-event competition, the Guangdong team, this year's National Master-Level competition champion, leads with 216.1 points.

On the light green carpet, the floor exercises of both male and female athletes were particularly attractive. Guangdong's Zhu Qiping, Hebei's Bao Naijian, and Beijing's An Jinglai tied for first place with 9.6 points in the men's competition. The women's competition was especially moving, as they performed the same movements to the melodious music, but each showed their own characteristics. Hebei's Ma Wenjuan's movements were gentle and elegant, with relatively subtle emotions, earning her 9.5 points.

In the men's parallel bars competition, one brilliant moment followed another. On the first day of the competition, Hebei's Yang Jianmin achieved an excellent score of 9.9 points and led the field. However, on the evening of the 22nd, Yu Lie-feng (Shanghai), the 1958 all-around champion, surpassed him with 9.95 points. The scores of the top eight on the parallel bars were all above 9.6 points.

Guangdong's Men Xiaomin performed her movements on the balance beam steadily and beautifully. When she dismounted, it was as if she were nailed to the floor, without the slightest movement, achieving a high score of 9.65, more than 0.4 points better than the second-place finisher.

In other events, the young athletes also performed very well. Hebei's Li Yueming was still a junior athlete last year. This time, she scored 9.6 points in the vault, ranking second. Xu Taiming, the only 18-year-old athlete from the People's Liberation Army without the title of master athlete, ranked first in the vault with a score of 9.75.

The Shaanxi women's team, which does not have a single master athlete, and the Hunan team, which is composed entirely of first-level athletes, showed rapid progress in the competition. They have basically overcome the difficult hurdle of the handspring vault (side horse).

    体操规定动作赛完
    解放军男队和广东女队团体总分领先
    据新华社23日讯　第一届全国运动会体操比赛告一阶段，代表二十八个单位的各地四百多名男女选手已经完成了规定动作。
    这次比赛的规定动作采用世界体操锦标赛的规定动作。难度相当高。什刹海体育馆里，洋溢着青春和活力。运动员们的动作绝大部分完成得很好。
    男子六个项目规定动作比赛的结果，队员实力平均的解放军队以三三一点三分领先。1956年全国冠军、1959年全国健将级比赛团体亚军河北队以三二七点三五分列第二，这个队的著名选手鲍乃健个人全能以五十六点六分领先。
    女子四项比赛结果，今年全国健将级比赛冠军队广东队二一六点一分领先。
    在嫩绿色的地毯上，男女选手的自由体操的比赛特别吸引人。男子选手广东的朱启平、河北的鲍乃健和北京的安景来三人以九点六分并列第一。女选手的比赛尤为动人，她们随着悠扬的琴韵做着同一样的动作，但都表现了各人的特点。河北队的马雯娟动作文静高雅，感情比较含蓄，取得九点五分。
    在男子双杠比赛中一个精彩镜头接一个精彩镜头。比赛开始第一天河北队的杨健民取得了九点九分的优异成绩一直领先。到22日晚上，1958年全能冠军于烈烽（上海）却以九点九五分超过了他。双杠前八名的成绩都在九点六分以上。
    广东女子队的门晓敏在平衡木上动作做得又稳又美，下木时就像钉子?在地板上一样，丝毫不动，取得了九点六五的高分，比第二名成绩好零点四分之多。
    其他项目中，年轻的选手们都表现得很好。河北队的李月明去年还是少年级运动员，这次跳马中获得了九点六分，列第二。解放军队唯一没有健将称号的十八岁选手徐泰明以九点七五分的成绩列跳马第一。
    队中没有一名健将的陕西女子队和都是一级运动员的湖南队比赛中表现出进步很快。她们基本上克服了支撑跳跃（横马）这个难关。
