Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. The Taiping People's Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, has fully mobilized the masses, reformed and repaired deep plowing tools, and promoted advanced operating methods in deep plowing, improving work efficiency and ensuring the quality of deep plowing.

When the commune started deep plowing, 40% of the deep plowing tools had not yet been repaired, and only 900 mu of land could be plowed daily. The commune's winter sowing deep plowing area this year is more than twice as large as last year's deep plowing task. If the manpower and tools are not increased, it will take until February next year to deep plow once. The commune party committee, through opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, gradually increased the labor force for deep plowing from 5,000 to 27,000 people. At the same time, it emphasized relying on the masses to reform and repair tools and improve operating techniques to ensure the timely completion of the deep plowing task. The commune organized 320 iron and wood workers to work overnight to convert more than 800 double-furrow plows into single-furrow deep plows, and adopted a method combining leadership and the masses, reforming, repairing, and plowing at the same time.

By taking the above measures, the total number of plows put into deep plowing each day increased from the original 1,200 to more than 2,500, coupled with manual deep digging, the daily deep plowing progress increased to 8,400 mu. The commune's 145,000 mu deep plowing task can be completed before September 20.

This newspaper reports that Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, has decided to vigorously promote new strip seeding tools this year to ensure the rapid and effective completion of the sowing task.

Last autumn sowing, the county used a small number of new seed drills. The new seed drill sows evenly, can widen the sowing width, and the sowing speed is fast, which is twice as fast as the old-fashioned seed drill strip seeding. According to experiments, under the same management conditions, wheat sown with the new seed drill generally yields about 10% more than wheat sown with the old-fashioned seed drill due to the even sowing. Therefore, this year the county plans to transform all the original 7,000 old-fashioned seed drills and add 2,000 new seed drills.

At present, more than 1,500 iron and wood workers across the county are rushing to manufacture and transform new seed drills every day.

    枣阳县太平公社改制工具加快深耕进度
    怀远县决定在秋种当中大力推广新式耧
    据新华社武汉讯　湖北省枣阳县太平人民公社在深翻土地中，充分发动群众，改制修配深耕工具，推广先进操作方法，提高了工效，保证了深耕质量。
    这个公社深耕开始时，由于深翻工具有40％还没有修好，每天只能犁地九百亩。全社今年冬播深翻面积比去年深翻任务大两倍多，如果不增加力量和工具，要到明年2月才能深翻一道。公社党委通过反右倾、鼓干劲，将深翻土地的劳动大军由五千人逐步增加到二万七千人。同时，强调依靠群众，改制修配工具和提高操作技术，保证按期完成深翻任务。全社组织三百二十个铁木工人，连夜突击把八百多部双铧犁，改成了单铧深耕犁，并采取领导和群众相结合的办法，边深翻、边改制、边修配。
    通过采取以上措施，全公社每天投入深耕的各种犁由原来的一千二百部增加到二千五百多部，加上人工深挖，每天深翻的进度增加到八千四百亩，全公社十四万五千亩深翻任务可以提前在9月20日以前完成。
    本报讯　安徽怀远县今年决定大力推广新式条播工具，保证又快又好地完成播种任务。
    去年秋种时，这个县曾使用了一小部分新式耧。新式耧播种均匀，能加宽播幅，而且播种速度快，比旧式耧条播速度快一倍。根据试验，在同样管理条件下用新式耧播种的小麦，因播种均匀，一般比旧式耧播种的麦地要增产10％左右。因此，今年全县计划将原来的七千部旧式耧全部改制，并新添二千部新式耧。
    目前，全县每天有一千五百多铁木工人赶制和改制新式耧。
