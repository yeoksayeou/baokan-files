    Our Joy and the American Gentlemen's Sorrow
    Dong Fengya
    Eisenhower said to Khrushchev: "We have had meetings, and I hope that these meetings will at least mean the beginning of the thawing of the ice, as you said, and I hope so. But nevertheless, I disagree with some of your opinions. You said that you would go to China after you return to the Soviet Union. If I went to the Soviet Union, I would not go to China after leaving the Soviet Union." (Xinhua News Agency, 18th)
    Everyone cares about the "thawing of the ice," and those who are committed to the thawing of the ice, whether proactively or passively, will be welcomed. Mr. Eisenhower has already benefited a lot from this. Eisenhower probably always wants to find ways to show disagreement with Khrushchev, so he said this. But what does it mean to bring up China? Is it because he is afraid that the Chinese people will forget that he is hostile to China? Or is he trying his best to cast some cold shadows on the festive joy of others?
    However, in any case, the American president's words seem to reveal some feelings. Mentioning China makes him feel bad, probably because it often touches his hidden pain. The existence of a powerful and thriving People's Republic of China often makes him heartbroken, which is known to everyone in the world; even the piece of land in Taiwan that they have painstakingly managed for ten years (that is, the "free China" they have exaggerated), does not seem to suit their wishes. Otherwise, why are some pro-American elements in Taipei and Hong Kong so confrontational and engaged in the anti-Chiang movement? In the minds of the American rulers, they naturally still hope for another China that can be easily manipulated. They have hoped for it for more than a hundred years, and they have painstakingly managed it with billions of dollars. As a result, a new China that pricks their eyes and minds has emerged with a bang. Thus, the "democratic individualists," and whatnot, vanished in that thunderclap. After so much hard work, they couldn't even get something to comfort their hearts. Isn't this a great sorrow for those gentlemen?
    The thunderclap ten years ago was the salute for the birth of our new China, and it was also the death knell for the "heavenly China" in the hearts of the American gentlemen. Now, our new China has become so radiant and dazzling, and more than 600 million Chinese people are celebrating its tenth anniversary so grandly and warmly, and people all over the world are heartily congratulating us. How can this not make those who are approaching their twilight years feel sentimental? It is sad enough not to mention it; mentioning the "thawing of the ice" is even more likely to cause grief; and what's more, someone even mentioned in person that they would rush to participate in the tenth anniversary celebration of the new China? This sorrow is by no means comparable. In front of the distinguished guests, Mr. Eisenhower, suppressing his heartache and briefly making cold remarks, can be considered a person with a little self-restraint and cultivation.
    However, we will therefore feel even more joyful during the festival. Because it does indeed further prove the strength of our new China's vitality and the infinite brightness of its future!

    我们的欢乐和美国老爷的悲痛
    董逢亚
    艾森豪威尔对赫鲁晓夫说：“我们已经有过会晤，我希望这些会晤至少能够像您所说的那样意味着冰层融化的开始，我希望这样。但是，尽管如此，我还是不同意您提出的某些意见。您说过，您回苏联以后将到中国去。如果我去苏联，我是不会在离开苏联后到中国去的。”（新华社十八日电）
    人人都关心“冰层融化”，致力于冰层融化的人，不论是出自主动，还是出于被动，都会受到人们的欢迎。艾森豪威尔先生已经是因此沾光不浅了。艾森豪威尔大概处处总要想办法表现出同赫鲁晓夫有分歧，所以说了这段话。但是，扯到中国又是什么意思？莫非他害怕中国人忘掉他是仇视中国的吗？还是尽力所能及地给别人节日的欢乐投上一些阴冷的暗影呢？
    但是，不管怎么样，美国总统的话，好像泄露了一些什么心情。一提到中国，就会使他的心情不佳，这大概是因为常常触到他的隐痛的缘故。强大的中华人民共和国的存在，而又蒸蒸日上欣欣向荣，常要使他痛心疾首，这是天下尽人皆知的了；就是他们苦心经营了十年的台湾一块土，（即他们所夸大其辞的“自由中国”），看来也并不合他们的意，不然，台北和香港的一些亲美分子，那样剑拔弩张，大搞其倒蒋运动，又是为了什么呢？在美国统治者的心目中，自然还想望有另一个能够操纵自如的中国。他们盼望了一百多年，为它不惜上亿的美元，苦心经营，结果霹雳一声，脱颖而出的竟是这样一个刺他们心目的新中国。于是，“民主的个人主义者”呀，什么什么呀，在那一声霹雳中就冰消瓦解了。一番辛苦之后，连聊慰心怀的东西都捞不到，对那些老爷们来说这岂不是一个极大的悲哀么？
    十年前的一声霹雳，是我们这个新中国的诞生的礼炮，也正是美国老爷们心目中“天堂的中国”的丧钟。如今，我们的新中国竟是出落得如此光华耀人，六亿多中国人又是这样隆重热烈地庆祝她的十周年，全世界的人又是那样热心地为我们祝贺，这怎能不使那些暮景将至的人触景伤情呢？不提起来已是够伤心的了；提起“冰层的融化”来，更足以引起悲痛了；何况有人竟又当面提到要赶去参加新中国的十年大庆？这悲哀又岂是寻常可比。在贵宾面前，捺耐住心痛，略述冷语，艾森豪威尔先生总算不失是一个稍有涵性修养的人了。
    然而，我们因此将在节日中更感欢乐。因为，它的确又反证着我们新中国生命力的强大和前途光明无限啊！
