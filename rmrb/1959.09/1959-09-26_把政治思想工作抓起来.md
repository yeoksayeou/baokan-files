    Grasp Political and Ideological Work
    In any work, there is a struggle between the advanced and the conservative, the new and the old, and autumn harvest is no exception. Autumn harvest may seem like a simple matter – who doesn't know that crops should be harvested when they are ripe? However, there are different views on what constitutes a good harvest. Some believe that we should strive for "bumper harvests with no grain left behind," and that it is entirely possible to avoid wasting grain during the autumn harvest. Others, however, believe that "with a bumper harvest, some loss is inevitable," and that losses and waste of grain are "unavoidable."
    Is it possible to avoid grain loss during the autumn harvest? This question reflects the struggle between the advanced and the conservative, between new and old ideas. Those with new and advanced ideas believe that losses can definitely be avoided. They fully estimate both the objective possibilities and the subjective initiative. They are convinced that as long as we give full play to subjective initiative and go all out, we can change objective conditions and turn objective possibilities into vivid reality. Those dominated by conservative ideas do the opposite. They see things as "fixed," believing that things must remain as they were in the past. They neither see the objective possibility of avoiding grain loss nor fully appreciate the subjective initiative of people. Therefore, in their view, grain loss during the autumn harvest becomes an "unavoidable" matter.
    What are the objective conditions for this year's autumn harvest? The crops are growing uniformly and densely, and the ripening period is earlier and more concentrated than in previous years, making harvesting more labor-intensive and time-consuming than in the past. This does increase the difficulty of doing a timely and proper job of autumn harvesting. However, this year we have more favorable conditions than in previous years, greatly strengthening the objective possibility of doing a fast and good job of autumn harvesting. These are: after a year of construction and consolidation, the people's communes are healthier and more consolidated, and are better able to give full play to the superiority of large organization, wide scope of activity, and abundant human, material, and financial resources; the consciousness of the members has also been further enhanced, and collectivist ideology has further increased; and the ability of commune cadres to organize and lead production has also become stronger. As long as we see and are good at using these favorable conditions and go all out, we will definitely be able to do a fast and good job of autumn harvesting, and we will definitely be able to avoid wasting grain.
    Going all out is very important. When we go all out, objective possibilities will become reality; if we don't go all out, even if the conditions are very favorable, it will be of no avail. Because if we don't go all out, we will not try every means to use the favorable conditions and bring every small favorable factor into play; if favorable conditions cannot be brought into play, isn't it almost the same as having no favorable conditions! Whether we go all out or not depends on whether people are convinced that grain loss and waste can be avoided during the autumn harvest, and whether they are convinced that all the difficulties in the autumn harvest work can be overcome. With confidence, there will be determination, and with determination, there will be drive. Where does confidence come from? It comes from a correct analysis of subjective and objective conditions, and a deep understanding of the importance of doing a careful job of harvesting and threshing and increasing production and saving grain.
    To ensure that every member participating in the autumn harvest can be full of confidence and go all out to engage in the autumn harvest battle, so as to achieve "bumper harvest with no grain left behind" and "ten out of ten years of good harvest," we must grasp political and ideological work during the autumn harvest, so that everyone can understand the importance and possibility of careful harvesting and threshing and not losing a single grain.
    The recent debate in Dongning Management District of Zhoujia People's Commune in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, on whether it is possible to achieve zero grain loss during the autumn harvest, is a lively and vigorous political and ideological education. It is hoped that other communes will also pay attention to grasping political and ideological work during the autumn harvest.

    把政治思想工作抓起来
    任何工作中都有先进与保守、新与旧的斗争，秋收也不例外。秋收，看起来好像是很简单的事情，谁还不知道庄稼成熟了就应当收回来？但是，究竟怎样才算收得好，却有不同的看法。有人认为应当“丰产丰收，颗粒不丢”，在秋收中完全可以做到不糟踏浪费粮食；有人却认为“丰收丰收，必有一丢”，损失和浪费粮食是“不可避免”的事情。
    在秋收中能不能避免损失粮食？在这个问题上，反映出先进和保守、新思想和旧思想的斗争。具有新的、先进的思想的人认为损失一定能够避免。他们既充分估计了客观可能性，又充分估计了主观能动性。他们确信，只要充分发挥主观能动性，鼓足干劲，就一定能改变客观条件，使客观可能性变成活生生的现实。在保守思想支配下的人恰恰相反，他们把事情看“死”了，认为过去是什么样子，现在就一定还得是什么样子；他们既看不到避免糟损粮食的客观可能性，更不能充分估计到人的主观能动性。因此，在他们看来，秋收中糟损粮食就成为“不可避免”的事情了。
    什么是今年秋收的客观条件呢？庄稼长得整齐、茂密，成熟时期比往年提早、集中，收割起来要比往年费工、费时。这的确增加了适时地妥善地做好秋收工作的困难。但是，今年具备了比往年更为有利的条件，把秋收工作做得又快又好的客观可能性大大加强了。这便是：在经过了一年的建设和整顿以后，人民公社更加健全和巩固了，更能够充分发挥组织规模大、活动范围广、人力物力财力雄厚的优越性；社员的觉悟也有了进一步的提高，集体主义思想有了进一步的增长；公社干部组织生产、领导生产的能力也更强了。只要看到了并善于运用这些有利条件，鼓足干劲，就一定能够把秋收工作做得又快又好，一定能够避免糟踏粮食。
    鼓足干劲这一点非常重要。干劲足，客观可能性才会变为现实；干劲不足，即使条件十分有利，也会与事无补。因为干劲不足，就不会千方百计地去运用有利条件，使每一点细小的有利因素都发挥作用；有利条件不能发挥作用，岂不是同没有有利条件差不多！而干劲足不足，又决定于人们是否确信秋收中损失浪费粮食能够避免，是否确信能够克服秋收工作中的一切困难。有信心，才会有决心，也才会有干劲。信心从何而来？来源于对主观、客观条件的正确分析，对做好秋收工作、增产节约粮食的重要意义的深刻了解。
    要使每个参加秋收工作的社员，都能满怀信心、鼓足干劲投入秋收战斗，做到“丰产丰收，颗粒不丢”“十成年景十成收”，就必须在秋收中抓紧政治思想工作，使每个人都能了解细收细打、不损失一粒粮食的重要性和可能性。
    黑龙江省双城县周家人民公社东宁管理区，最近开展了一场秋收中能不能做到毫不损失粮食的辩论，就是一次生动活泼的政治思想教育。希望其他公社也能注意抓紧秋收中的政治思想工作。
