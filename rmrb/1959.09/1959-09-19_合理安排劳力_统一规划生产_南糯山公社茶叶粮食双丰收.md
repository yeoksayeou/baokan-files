    Rationally Arrange Labor Force and Unify Production Planning
    Nan Nuo Mountain Commune Achieves Double Harvest of Tea and Grain

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Nan Nuo Mountain People's Commune in Menghai County, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has overcome the historical contradiction of not being able to grow tea well and not being able to grow grain well in the year since it was established, achieving a double harvest of tea and grain.

    Nan Nuo Mountain is one of the six famous tea mountains producing Pu'er tea. This year's spring and summer teas have had bumper harvests, and the commune members are now starting to pick autumn tea. It is estimated that the total tea production this year will be more than double the highest historical annual output of 220,000 jin. At present, the rice on Nan Nuo Mountain is already heading, and the Aini ethnic commune members are weeding and fertilizing. In the past, at this time, the Aini people were weeding the rice while worrying about food; now, the commune canteen is still cooking last year's rice. Last year's total grain output increased by 35% compared to 1957.

    The Nan Nuo Mountain People's Commune cultivates more than 8,000 mu of Pu'er tea and 2,700 mu of paddy fields. In the past, when the spring tea grew vigorously, it was the season for busy spring sowing; when the summer tea sprouted, it was the time for transplanting and summer hoeing; tea and grain production had great conflicts in terms of seasonal timing. In addition, at that time, the Kuomintang suppressed the tea price very low, with one jin of tea only exchanged for one jin of rice. The Aini people had no choice but to abandon the tea gardens and grow grain. In 1950, the entire tea mountain only harvested more than 30,000 jin.

    In recent years, the Party and the People's Government have reasonably raised the tea price, distributed many farm tools free of charge, and supplied a large amount of grain. The land reform in 1956 returned the tea gardens to the hands of the Aini farmers. Therefore, the Aini people's enthusiasm for production has been very high, and eight agricultural cooperatives have been formed in the great development of production. Most of the tea gardens have been reclaimed, and tea production has increased year by year. However, due to the small scale of the agricultural cooperatives and the lack of manpower, the contradiction between grain production and tea production has not been completely resolved. The local average is only a little more than one mu of paddy field per person, and they are unable to process it meticulously, with an average yield of only more than 300 jin per mu. Although the tea gardens have been basically reclaimed, they have also been producing only dozens of jin of tea per mu on average because no one could be spared for cultivation and fertilization. Last spring, the Aini people of the eight agricultural cooperatives automatically implemented large-scale cooperation, breaking many backward customs, building more than 80 water conservancy projects, and reclaiming more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields. The output of spring and summer tea was much higher than in 1957.

    After the establishment of the People's Commune in October last year, tea and grain production were unified, and the manpower and materials of each small cooperative were allocated. The villages near the dams were designated to specialize in the production of grain and cotton, while the other villages mainly managed tea gardens and appropriately arranged grain production. The tea and grain contradiction that was not resolved from individual farming to cooperatives was basically resolved after communization. Because the commune is large, with many people and abundant funds, it has also established its own tea preliminary processing factory, using hydraulic and animal-powered kneading machines instead of manual rubbing and foot treading, which not only saves a lot of labor but also improves the efficiency of tea production. Last year, 380,000 jin of tea were produced, breaking the highest historical annual output. The tea preliminary processing factory has also successfully trial-produced very high-quality tea. Also, because more labor was transferred to field management, grain also achieved a bumper harvest.

    Last winter and this spring, the Nan Nuo Mountain People's Commune mobilized commune members to remove parasitic plants from 8,000 mu of tea gardens, carried out overall cultivation for the first time, and applied more than 20 million jin of topdressing fertilizer. Therefore, this year's tea is growing more vigorously than in any previous year. Because the commune unified the arrangement of labor, the vast majority of spring tea and summer tea were picked in time, and the tea that has already been picked has increased by about 15% compared to the same period last year.

    Tea production has increased year by year, and the income of the Aini people has increased year by year. In 1958, the average wage of all commune members increased by more than 10% compared to 1957 before the establishment of the commune. This year, the total tea income of the commune has increased by more than 20% compared to the same period last year. The commune pays wages every two months, and each laborer can receive about fifteen yuan each time on average.

    Now, the Aini commune members of the Nan Nuo Mountain People's Commune are responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and are launching a new upsurge in production. These days, the Aini people are busy picking tea day and night. People expressed at the oath-taking rally: We must produce 500,000 jin of tea before the National Day.

### 合理安排劳力　统一规划生产  南糯山公社茶叶粮食双丰收

    合理安排劳力　统一规划生产
    南糯山公社茶叶粮食双丰收
    本报讯　云南西双版纳傣族自治州勐海县南糯山人民公社，办社一年，克服了历史上种不好茶，种不好粮的矛盾，取得了茶粮双丰收。
    南糯山是盛产普洱茶的六大茶山之一，今年的春茶和夏茶得到了大丰收，现在社员们又开始采摘秋茶。估计今年茶叶的总产量将比历史上最高年产量二十二万斤增加一倍多。现在，南糯山上的稻子已经孕穗，爱尼族社员正在薅草施肥。往年这时候，爱尼人一面薅秧，一面为吃粮问题发愁；现在公社食堂的锅里煮的还是去年的大米。去年粮食总产量比1957年增产35％。
    南糯山人民公社种着八千多亩普洱茶和二千七百多亩水田。过去，每当春茶猛发时，正是紧张的春播时节；夏茶抽芽，又值栽插和夏锄的时候；茶叶和粮食生产在节令上有很大矛盾。加以那时国民党把茶价压得很低，一斤茶只换一斤米，爱尼人只好丢了茶园种粮食。1950年整个茶山只采摘了三万多斤。
    几年来，党和人民政府合理地提高了茶价，无偿地发放了许多农具，并供应了大量的粮食，1956年土改，又使茶园回到了爱尼农民手里。因此，爱尼人的生产积极性十分高涨，在生产大发展中组成了八个农业社。茶园大部分都垦复了，茶叶产量逐年上升。但是由于农业社的规模小、人手不够，粮食生产和茶叶生产的矛盾仍未得到彻底解决。当地平均每人只有一亩多水田，而且无力细致加工，平均亩产只有三百多斤。茶园虽然已经基本垦复，也因抽不出人来中耕施肥，平均每亩只产茶几十斤。去年春天，八个农业社的爱尼人自动实行大协作，破除了许多落后的习俗，修了八十多件水利工程，开垦了一千多亩水田，春夏茶的产量都比1957年高得多。
    去年10月成立人民公社后，统一安排了茶粮生产，调配了各小社的人力物力，指定靠近壩区的寨子专门生产粮食棉花，其他的几个寨子则以经营茶园为主，适当安排粮食生产。从单干到合作社没有解决的茶粮矛盾，在公社化以后基本上解决了。由于公社社大、人多、资金厚，还建立了公社自己的茶叶初制厂，用水力和畜力揉捻机代替了手搓脚踩，既节省了大量劳动力，又提高了制茶工效。去年共产茶三十八万多斤，突破了历史上的最高年产量。茶叶初制厂还试制成功了质量很高级的茶叶。也由于抽调了较多的劳动力从事田间管理，粮食也得到了大丰收。
    去冬今春，南糯山人民公社动员社员们清除了八千亩茶园的寄生植物，头一次全面地进行了中耕，并施了两千多万斤追肥。因此，今年的茶叶比过去任何一年都发得茂盛。由于公社统一安排劳动力，使绝大多数春茶夏茶及时地下了树，现在已经采摘的茶叶比去年同期增加了15％左右。
    茶叶年年增产，爱尼人的收入逐年上升。1958年全社社员平均工资比办公社前的1957年增加了10％以上。今年全社的茶叶收入又比去年同期增长了20％以上。公社每两个月发一次工资，平均每个劳动力每次可以得到十五元左右。
    现在，南糯山人民公社的爱尼社员响应八届八中全会的号召，掀起了新的生产高潮。这两天，爱尼人正日夜忙着采茶。人们在誓师大会上表示：在国庆节前一定要生产出五十万斤茶叶来。
