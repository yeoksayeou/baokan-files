To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Esteemed Comrades:

    On the occasion of the grand celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of Thailand, on behalf of the working people and patriotic, peace-loving, and democratic individuals of Thailand, extends fraternal congratulations to you and, through you, to the Chinese people.

    The achievements of the People's Republic of China in the past ten years have been enormous. Under the wise leadership of your Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved victory in the people's democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in terms of the private ownership of the means of production. On the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, you put forward the general line for building socialism, which is of great historical significance, and launched a great leap forward on all fronts of industrial and agricultural production and construction. At the same time, in less than a year, the rural areas of China have fully realized the communization of the people. The people's commune is a great creation of the Chinese people. Facts have proved that it is the best form to promote the development of social productive forces in China, accelerate China's socialist construction, and transition to a communist society in the future. We are very pleased to see that in August this year, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of your Party passed a resolution on launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and at the same time put forward to the people of the whole country the fighting task of completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year. All this is the product of your Party and Comrade Mao Zedong creatively combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the actual situation in China, providing valuable experience for the international communist movement and enriching the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. We firmly believe that the industrious, brave, and creative Chinese people, under the wise leadership of your Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, will surely achieve more brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction.

    The victory and achievements of the Chinese people have greatly enhanced the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, inspired the victorious confidence of the oppressed people all over the world, especially the colonial and semi-colonial people, promoted the collapse of the imperialist colonial system, and made great contributions to defending Asian and world peace.

    The Thai people have a long history of close relations with the Chinese people. The Thai people have always been concerned about the revolutionary activities of the Chinese people and rejoiced in the victory of the Chinese people. The founding of the People's Republic of China and its achievements over the past ten years have made the Thai people more aware that in order to change their destiny, they must more resolutely struggle against imperialism and its agents.

    Imperialism fears that the Thai people will become more awakened. Therefore, when the Thai people's voices for peace, neutrality, and democracy were rising, US imperialism instructed its agent Sarit Thanarat to implement military dictatorship, attack patriotic, peace-loving, and democratic forces, oppose communism and the people, and drag Thailand back into dark rule. At the same time, the Sarit military dictatorial government adopted a hostile policy towards the People's Republic of China, becoming a tool for US imperialism to create tension in Southeast Asia and interfere in the internal affairs of Thailand's neighbors. This reactionary behavior of US imperialism and the Sarit regime has prompted the Thai people to further recognize their reactionary faces, and discontent is growing, which provides favorable conditions for the People's Patriotic Democratic Front in its arduous struggle. The current policy of our Party is: to unite the working people of Thailand and all patriotic and democratic forces to carry out a resolute struggle to get rid of the control of US imperialism, realize national independence, neutrality, peace, democracy, and improve the people's living standards. We firmly believe that, under favorable domestic and international conditions, the Thai people will be able to get rid of the reactionary rule of US imperialism and its agents, and will certainly be able to establish diplomatic relations between Thailand and the People's Republic of China, and further develop the fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries.

    Finally, we sincerely congratulate the success of this celebration and wish the Chinese people even more brilliant achievements in the cause of building socialism under the wise leadership of your Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.

    With communist greetings,

                                    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand
                                     September 15, 1959

### 泰国共产党中央委员会的贺信

    泰国共产党中央委员会的贺信中国共产党中央委员会敬爱的同志们：
    值此中华人民共和国成立第十周年的伟大庆典之际，泰国共产党谨代表泰国劳动人民与爱国和平民主人士向你们，并通过你们向中国人民表示兄弟般的祝贺。
    中华人民共和国成立十年来的成就是巨大的。中国人民在贵党和毛泽东同志英明领导下取得了人民民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业在生产资料私有制方面的社会主义改造，又在整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，提出了具有重要历史意义的建设社会主义总路线，掀起了工农业生产建设各个战线上的大跃进，同时在不到一年的时间里，中国农村又全面实现了人民公社化，人民公社是中国人民的伟大创举，事实证明了它是推动中国社会生产力向前发展，加速中国社会主义建设并为将来过渡到共产主义社会的最好形式。我们很高兴地看到，今年8月，贵党八届八中全会通过了开展增产节约运动的决议，同时向全国人民提出要在今年内完成第二个五年计划主要指标的战斗任务。这一切都是贵党和毛泽东同志创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国实际结合起来的产物，给国际共产主义运动提供了宝贵的经验，丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。我们坚信，勤劳勇敢和富有创造性的中国人民在贵党和毛泽东同志英明领导下，必将在社会主义建设中取得更辉煌的成就。
    中国人民的胜利和成就，大大增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力，鼓舞了全世界被压迫人民特别是殖民地半殖民地人民的胜利信心，促进了帝国主义殖民体系的崩溃，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    泰国人民同中国人民有着悠久历史的亲密关系，泰国人民一向关心中国人民的革命活动并为中国人民的胜利而感到欢欣。中华人民共和国的成立及其十年来的成就，使泰国人民更加认识到要改变自己的命运，只有更加坚决地对帝国主义及其代理人进行斗争。　
    帝国主义惧怕泰国人民更加觉悟，因此，当泰国人民和平中立民主呼声高涨的时候，美帝国主义就指使其代理人乃沙立实行军事独裁，进攻爱国和平民主力量，反共反人民，把泰国再度拖进黑暗的统治。与此同时，乃沙立军事独裁政府对中华人民共和国采取敌视政策，成为美帝国主义在东南亚制造紧张局势和干涉泰国邻国内政的工具。美帝国主义与乃沙立政权的这种反动行为已促使泰国人民更加认识其反动面目，不满的情绪正在日益增长，这对在艰苦斗争中的人民爱国民主阵线提供了有利的条件。当前我党的政策是：团结泰国劳动人民和一切爱国民主力量，为摆脱美帝国主义的控制，实现国家的自主、中立、和平、民主和改善人民生活而进行坚决的斗争。我们坚信，在国内外的有利条件下，泰国人民必能摆脱美帝国主义及其代理人的反动统治，也一定能够建立起泰国和中华人民共和国的邦交，进一步发展我们两国人民的兄弟友谊。
    最后，我们衷心祝贺这次庆祝典礼获得成功，愿中国人民在贵党和毛泽东同志英明领导下建设社会主义的事业，取得更辉煌的成就。
    谨致共产主义敬礼
                                    泰国共产党中央委员会
                                     1959年9月15日
