Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 11th. The Indian Parliament's Federal Council (Upper House) held a three-hour debate on the Sino-Indian border issue on the 10th. Right-wing councilors and some councilors from the ruling Congress Party attacked the Chinese army for "invading" Indian territory and attacked Premier Zhou Enlai's reply letter to Nehru on September 8th.

The motion was raised by independent councilor Kunzru three days earlier. He had previously raised a motion regarding the situation in Tibet in May of this year and has repeatedly attacked China. At the beginning of the debate, he said that this was a major issue involving "a large area of Indian territory." He repeatedly stated that the so-called "McMahon Line" is the border of India.

He attacked Premier Zhou Enlai's letter, saying that it was "stronger and more aggressive in tone than his previous letters." He said, "Panchsheel has been used as an anesthetic and slogan to paralyze the Indian government and people." He said that recent developments "have actually put our foreign policy to a severe test," and he indicated that some changes may be made. He demanded that the Indian government "remedy the mistakes" and "maintain vigilance" on the border.

Congress Party councilor Sinha hoped that China and India would maintain friendship, while expressing doubt, saying: He didn't know if "the embrace is an embrace of love and friendship, or an embrace between two duelists." He demanded the strengthening of "defense" on India's northern border. He said, "We must create a situation in which China cannot but respect us."

Another Congress Party councilor, Chaman Lall, also insisted that "the McMahon Line is the Indian border." He clamored for the Chinese army to withdraw from the "occupied area."

People's Socialist Party councilor Ganga Sharan Sinha spread rumors in the debate about the Chinese army’s "large-scale invasion of Indian territory." He said that negotiations could only be conducted from a "position of strength" after "appropriately strengthening India's northern defenses."

Independent councilor Anand Chand also believed that the so-called "McMahon Line" should be the Sino-Indian border, but he also said that since the "McMahon Line" had not been demarcated on the ground, and the border area of Ladakh was vague, China might have reasons for adopting this attitude.

In his speech, Chand also said, "We must clearly recognize that Tibet is a necessary component of China." He also advocated that India should never "rashly engage in military alliances" like Pakistan (which is a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization). He expressed hope for achieving "a satisfactory solution that is conducive to peace in Asia."

Indian Communist Party councilor Ahmed said that the border between India and China had not been formally demarcated, which could cause some disputes. He said, in this case, "we should not rashly declare these disputes to be border aggression incidents." He criticized some political parties in India for "shouting hoarsely that aggression has occurred." He said that these political parties shouted that "coexistence with China is impossible," and they wantonly created panic, "which does not help the Indian people" and "does not help the cause of world peace."

Ahmed's speech was constantly interrupted by a group of People's Socialist Party and Congress Party councilors. When he mentioned that the recent incidents were "border incidents," some councilors from the People's Socialist Party and the Congress Party shouted "border aggression." He said powerfully, "I will never call these incidents acts of war or acts of aggression." He pointed out, "I don't think there is any objective basis for a war between the two countries," and "on the other hand, there is an objective basis for increasing harmony between the two countries." He said that friendly relations between India and China have existed for two thousand years, and "no belligerent propaganda in India or elsewhere can weaken this connection."

When a councilor from the People's Socialist Party interrupted him again, Ahmed said, "They are impatient because they want to change the Indian government's foreign policy." He demanded negotiations between the two countries.

Subsequently, Nehru delivered a speech. The meeting did not pass a resolution.

    印度联邦院辩论中印边界问题
    右派议员硬说中国军队侵入印度
    叫嚷从“实力地位”出发进行谈判
    新华社新德里11日电　印度议会联邦院（上院）10日就中印边界问题进行了三小时的辩论。右派议员和执政党国大党的一些议员在辩论中攻击中国军队“侵入”印度领土，攻击周恩来总理在9月8日写给尼赫鲁的复信。
    这项动议是由无党派议员孔兹鲁在三天以前提出的，他在今年5月曾经提出过关于西藏局势的动议，并且屡次攻击中国。他在辩论开始时说，这是一个所谓牵涉到“大块印度领土”的重大问题。他反复说，所谓“麦克马洪线”是印度的边界。
    他攻击周恩来总理的信说，这封信“在语调上比他以前写的信更强硬、更咄咄逼人”。他说，“潘查希拉已被用来作为麻痹印度政府和人民的麻醉剂和口号了。”他说，最近的事态发展“实际上已经使我们的外交政策受到了严酷考验”，他并且表示，有可能作出某种改变。他要求印度政府“弥补错误”，并且在边境“保持戒备”。
    国大党议员辛哈希望中印两国保持友谊，同时却表示怀疑说：不知道“拥抱是爱情和友谊的拥抱，还是两个决斗者之间的拥抱”。他要求加强印度北部边境的“防御”。他说，“我们必须造成一种局势，使中国不能不尊重我们。”
    另一名国大党议员查曼拉尔也硬说“麦克马洪线是印度边界”。他叫嚷要中国军队从“占领地区”撤退。
    人民社会党议员甘加·夏兰·辛哈在辩论中散布所谓中国军队“大规模侵入印度领土”的谣言。他说，只能在“适当加强印度北部防御”以后，从“实力地位”出发进行谈判。
    无党派议员阿南德·昌德也认为所谓“麦克马洪线”应该是中印边界，但是他又说，由于“麦克马洪线”没有在地面上划定，而拉达克一带的边界又模糊不清，中国采取这种态度可能是有理由的。
    昌德在发言中还说，“我们必须明确认识到，西藏是中国的一个必要的组成部分。”他还主张印度决不要像巴基斯坦（它是东南亚条约组织的成员国）建议的那样“冒冒失失地去搞军事联盟”。他表示希望取得“有利于亚洲和平的圆满解决”。
    印度共产党议员艾哈迈德说，印度和中国之间的边界未经正式划定，因而可能引起一些纠纷。他说，在这种情况下，“我们不应当冒冒失失地宣称这些纠纷是边境侵略事件”。他抨击印度的一些政党“声嘶力竭地叫嚷发生了侵略”。他说，这些政党叫喊说“同中国共处是不可能的”，它们肆意制造恐慌情绪，“这样做无助于印度人民”，并且“无助于世界和平事业”。
    艾哈迈德的发言不断被一批人民社会党和国大党的议员所打断。当他提到最近的事件是“边境事件”时，一些人民社会党和国大党的一些议员大叫“边境侵略”。他有力地说，“我决不把这些事件叫做战争行为或侵略行为”。他指出，“我认为不存在两国间发生战争的任何客观的基础”，而“另一方面，存在着两国间日益和睦的客观基础”。他说，印度和中国之间的友好联系已经存在两千年了，“印度或其他地方的任何好战的宣传都不能削弱这种联系”。
    当人民社会党的议员又打断他的话时，艾哈迈德说，“他们之所以不耐烦是因为他们希望改变印度政府的外交政策”。他要求两国举行谈判。
    随后，尼赫鲁发表了讲话。会议没有通过决议。
