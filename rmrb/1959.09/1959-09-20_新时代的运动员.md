    Athletes of the New Era
    Zhang Rongquan
    In our real life, sports are no longer a mere amusement for a few, but an important means of serving socialist construction.
    Physical exercise can enhance people's physique, contributing more to the construction and defense of the socialist motherland. Sports competitions are like a mirror, reflecting the thriving vitality of youth, inspiring people to live, work, and study with vigor and high spirits.
    On the sports field, an athlete's actions are like an artist's performance on the stage. With their noble style and superb skills, they inspire, enlighten, and educate the vast audience. The bravery and perseverance of athletes are utterly incompatible with the decadent, indolent, empty, and lazy habits. What people bring back from the sports field is upward vigor and solid drive, full of confidence in life. This is what the Party pointed out: "Sports are not only the most active and effective way to improve people's health and enhance their physique, but also an important means of cultivating people's bravery, perseverance, collectivist spirit, and conducting communist education for the working people."
    Under the Party's nurturing, a large number of outstanding athletes have emerged in our country in recent years. They appear on the sports field with a completely new look, distinctly different from that of the old athletes. They spare no effort and sweat for the collective honor, valuing unity and cooperation over personal gains and losses. They are not arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat, respecting referees and abiding by discipline. They diligently train hard on weekdays and strive for victory with bravery and tenacity during competitions. Many of our world record creators and national record creators possess these noble qualities. They receive praise and applause from the audience in the sports field not only because of their superb skills but also because of their noble style. A team, no matter how good its skills or how many games it wins, will not be praised by the people if it has a bad style, is arrogant, or becomes lax and tired. Conversely, when we see someone persisting tirelessly in a long-distance race, exerting their best effort to reach the finish line despite lagging behind, they often win enthusiastic applause from the audience. This means that in the eyes of the people, sports competitions are not only a competition of skills but also a competition of politics, drive, and style.
    Of course, sports competitions are about winning or losing, about high and low. Any sports competition involves two opposing aspects; one side wins, and the other side must lose. To strive for victory and avoid defeat, we must do everything possible to find the opponent's weaknesses, deploy tactics to achieve unexpected victories, hit the opponent's technical weaknesses, give no ground, fight for every ball, and display a tenacious fighting spirit. Is this contradictory to the communist style? No! This is precisely the revolutionary collectivist heroism. You are better than me, but I am even stronger than you; this kind of mutual competition can push us to progress faster. And it is precisely those with a communist style who can avoid being shaken by personal gains and losses, and not be intimidated by temporary difficulties, but fight to the end with unwavering determination. If an athlete lacks the confidence to strive for victory, shrinks back in the face of difficulties, and hands over victory, this is a sign of a lack of ambition. The process of athletes striving for initiative and overcoming difficulties in competitions is the process of cultivating courage and tenacity. If a person can seize opportunities with a clear mind and defeat opponents by discovering their weaknesses in the tense moment when victory or defeat hangs in the balance; if they can grit their teeth and persevere to the end even when their physical strength is exhausted, then with these valuable qualities, they can also charge into battle on all fronts of our cause, and be invincible.
    In capitalist society, the sports field is a gambling den for idle gentlemen and a paradise for adventurers seeking fame and profit. Athletes are gambling tools, "living commodities" to be auctioned off at will. As Gorky said: there, sports have an extremely simple and clear purpose: to make people even more stupid than they were originally, and there, a cry is being issued louder and louder: "Enough of reason, eliminate thought!" Such athletes, of course, cannot have great creative ambitions, nor can they have a real sense of honor and pride. All they have is a fierce fight to the death and the temporary satisfaction of jackal greed.
    Today, our athletes come from the people. Our athletes have the Party's education. Our athletes have the support of the brave and hardworking people. Our athletes have a clear purpose of serving the socialist cause. They should give full play to their greatest subjective initiative, give full play to all their intelligence and talents, compete with each other, improve together, create excellent results for the motherland, and contribute to the motherland's sports cause.
    On the one hand, there is revolutionary heroism with bravery and tenacity, full of energy, and striving for victory; on the other hand, there is the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, humility, and solid work. This is the characteristic of athletes of our era. Only in this way can we be worthy of what the era demands of us.

    新时代的运动员
    张荣泉
    在我们的现实生活中，体育运动已不是少数人玩玩乐乐的儿戏，而是为社会主义建设服务的重要手段。
    体育锻炼可以增强人们的体质，为建设和保卫社会主义祖国贡献更大力量。运动竞赛则像一面镜子，从中可以看出欣欣向荣的青春活力，激励人们精神奋发、意气昂扬地去生活、工作和学习。
    在运动场上，一个运动员的行动，就像一个艺术家在舞台上的表演一样，他以自己崇高的风格和精湛的技巧，使广大观众从中得到感染、启发、教育。运动员的勇敢、坚毅风格，和那种萎靡、怠惰、空虚、懒散的习性是多么不可调和。人们从运动场上所带回来的，是向上的朝气和坚实的干劲，对生活充满信心。这也就是党所指出的：“体育运动不仅是改善人民健康状况、增强人民体质的一种最积极的有效方法，而且是培养人民勇敢、坚毅、集体主义精神和向劳动人民进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一。”
    在党的培养下，几年来我国涌现了大批的优秀运动员。他们以和旧运动员迥乎不同的全新风貌，出现在运动场上。他们为集体荣誉而不辞流汗辛劳，重团结合作而不计个人得失。他们胜不骄、败不馁，尊重裁判，遵守纪律。他们平日兢兢业业刻苦锻炼，比赛时勇敢顽强力争胜利。我们的许多世界纪录创造者和国家纪录创造者，都具有这些高贵品质。他们在运动场上受到观众的赞扬和鼓掌，不仅是因为他们技术高超，更因为他们具有崇高的风格。一个球队技术再好，赢球再多，如果他们作风恶劣或者盛气凌人，松劲疲沓，他们是得不到人民的表扬的。反之，当我们在长距离赛跑中看到虽然落后于别人而能坚持不懈，尽最大努力冲向终点的，往往能博得观众的热烈掌声。这就是说，在人民的眼光中，运动竞赛不仅是技术的竞赛，而且是比政治、比干劲、比风格的竞赛。
    当然，运动竞赛是要争胜负、比高低的。任何一项运动比赛，都对垒着互为矛盾的两个方面，一方胜利，必有一方失败。为了争取胜利、避免失败，又必须千方百计地寻找对方弱点，部署出奇制胜的战术，击中对方技术上的要害，寸步不让，每球必争，发挥顽强的战斗精神，这是不是和共产主义风格矛盾呢？不！这正是革命的集体英雄主义精神。你比我好，我比你还强，这样互相竞赛，才能推动我们进步得更快。而且恰恰就是那些具有共产主义风格的人，才能不为个人得失所动摇，不为暂时的困难所吓倒，一往直前战斗到底。如果一个运动员没有力争胜利的信心，在困难面前萎缩不前，把胜利拱手让人，这倒是缺乏志气的表现。运动员在比赛中力争主动、克服困难的过程，就是培养勇敢精神和顽强意志的过程。一个人在运动比赛中，能够在胜负系于千钧一发的紧张关头，头脑清醒地抓住战机，发现对手弱点击败对手；能够在体力已经不支的情况下，咬紧牙关坚持到底，有了这种宝贵品质，就同样能在我们事业的各个战线上冲锋陷阵，无坚不摧。
    在资本主义社会里，运动场是游手好闲的老爷们的赌窟，是腊名牟利的冒险家的乐园，运动员是赌博工具，是任意拍卖的“有生命的商品”。正如高尔基所说的：在那里，运动具有极其简单而明确的目的：使人变得比他原来还要更加愚蠢，在那里，愈来愈响亮地发出一种呼声：“理性够了，消灭思想！”这样的运动员，当然不可能有伟大的创造抱负，不可能有真正的荣誉感和自豪感，有的只是你死我活的厮拚和豺狼贪欲的暂时满足。
    今天，我们的运动员来自人民。我们的运动员有党的教育。我们的运动员有勇敢勤劳的人民的支持。我们的运动员有着为社会主义事业服务的明确目的。应该发挥出最大的主观能动性，发挥出自己一切聪明才智，互相比赛，共同提高，为祖国创造优异成绩，为祖国的体育事业作出贡献。
    一方面具有勇敢顽强、鼓足干劲、力争胜利的革命英雄主义；一方面又有团结互助、谦虚扎实的精神，这就是我们时代运动员特色。也只有这样，才无愧于时代所要求于我们的。
