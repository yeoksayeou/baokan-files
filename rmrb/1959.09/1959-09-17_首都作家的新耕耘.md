　　New Cultivation of Capital Writers
　　By Our Reporter Zhu Jigong

　　Tian Han Creates "Princess Wencheng"
　　The famous playwright Tian Han, in his busy schedule, has completed his fifth play since liberation, "Princess Wencheng."

　　Tian Han said that this play mainly aims to reflect the blood-like friendship and unity between the Han and Tibetan people through the marriage of Princess Wencheng and the Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo. Princess Wencheng is an ambitious and intelligent girl. As soon as she left Chang'an, she wanted to bring the relatively advanced economy and culture of the Tang Dynasty to the Tibetan people for widespread dissemination. For the creation of this play, the old writer collected a large amount of material, from the old and new "Tang Books" to the fairy tale booklet "Princess Wencheng," and even the "Buddhist Dictionary" were carefully read. He also visited the Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, Venerable Juezan. In the past, when this old writer wrote, as long as the theme was mature, he often started writing immediately and completed it in one go. This time, in order to deliberately pursue perfection, he exceptionally wrote out the outline of each scene one by one, and then carefully pondered it.

　　The combination of realism and romanticism is a feature of this play. Tian Han cleverly wrote some interesting myths into the play. In the play, when Princess Wencheng arrived at Nalasala Mountain in Qinghai, the north wind blew sand, and the horses neighed sadly, causing her infinite sadness. The entourage told the princess that this place was called "Daotang River." Folk tales once circulated: "After crossing Daotang River, it is another world, with cattle and sheep as companions, and few people for thousands of miles." This sentence stirred the princess's homesickness, and she took out the Sun and Moon Treasure Mirror given by her mother, the Empress Wende. Suddenly, from the mirror, she saw Empress Wende in Chang'an, seriously ill from missing the princess. The princess was extremely sad and threw out the treasure mirror, which immediately turned into a beautiful "Sun and Moon Mountain." Tian Han said: A handful of lovesick tears, turned into Sun and Moon Mountain, the play is "romantic" like this, but in the future performance, it will be difficult for the director and stage art designers!

　　Yang Mo Adds a Story to Lin Daojing
　　In the countryside of Ding County, the willows are green, and the river is gurgling. A clear song came from the river: "The sorghum leaves are green and green, the Japanese soldiers came on September 18th, first occupying the gunpowder depot, then occupying the Beida Camp..." Lin Daojing was singing with her students when the reactionary Dean of Students, Wu Yutian, came over. Lin Daojing reluctantly dismissed the children. A few days later, Jiang Hua, disguised as a teacher, arrived. Lin Daojing confided her inner distress to this young underground party leader, and Jiang Hua patiently educated her: "If you care about the lives of the peasants, you won't feel bored!" Lin Daojing understood and gradually went deep into the masses. Once, the vicious landlord Wu Rengui and his lackeys were about to beat an innocent farmer in the field when Lin Daojing happened to find out. She said with irrepressible anger: "I will not allow you to exploit and oppress the peasants so cruelly!" Soon, Lin Daojing covered Jiang Hua and together they launched a wheat harvest struggle to mobilize the peasants to resist the exploitation of the big landlord.

　　Yang Mo, the author of "The Song of Youth," found that the original novel did not write enough about Lin Daojing's revolutionary activities in the countryside when adapting the film script, so she made this addition.

　　Ouyang Yuqian's New Work "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
　　The first modern drama with a complete script in the history of Chinese drama, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," has recently been rewritten by the veteran playwright Ouyang Yuqian, making it more contemporary and politically significant.

　　More than fifty years ago, the Qing government was corrupt and incompetent, and the "powers" oppressed China. A group of Chinese students studying in Japan organized a drama club called "Spring Willow Society." Based on the novel by the American female writer Stowe, the story of the American mistreatment of blacks, they compiled "Uncle Tom's Cabin" to promote national thought. In June 1907, the Spring Willow Society premiered the play, which was welcomed by the vast audience. For decades, this script has long been lost.

　　Currently, American racists still cruelly mistreat blacks, and imperialists' aggression against Africa and Latin America is intensifying. Based on new perspectives, the veteran playwright Ouyang Yuqian wrote this drama with unparalleled indignation against colonialists and deep sympathy for the people of the colonies. In order to commemorate the first performance of the Spring Willow Society fifty years ago, the original name "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is still used.

　　In the new script, the author reveals the noble spiritual outlook of the oppressed people through two indomitable black characters. The conflicts in the drama are very strong. The white slave owner gives a whip to the black man Tom, using the method of promoting him to be a foreman to lure him, but Tom refuses. The slave owner roars: "You are my slave, even your soul is mine," Tom retorts: "You can buy my body, but you can't buy my soul, the soul will always belong to me!" When Tom was beaten and unable to move, he secretly helped several female slaves escape. And he firmly refused to reveal where these slaves had fled to. The slave owner said: "Can't I subdue you!" Tom said majestically: "You have everything, but you lack one thing – a soul!" In the end, Tom sacrificed himself, but his spirit of resistance will always inspire the enslaved and oppressed people to unite and move towards the light!

　　Tian Jian Talks About the Sequel to "The Cart Driver's Biography"
　　The poet Tian Jian has just returned to Beijing from his "base" – the Garden People's Commune in Huailai County, Hebei Province, holding a sample of a long poem, and told reporters: The sequel to "The Cart Driver's Biography" will soon be published.

　　Around 1946, a myth of the "Five Impossibilities Stele" circulated in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. One evening, a village near the enemy area suddenly rose with a ten-thousand-zhang red light. People rushed to go there, but the red light and the beautiful village disappeared, but a stone tablet was written: "The Central Army can't be the chief forever. The Eighth Route Army can't leave. The wealthy households can't be rich forever. The poor can't be poor forever. The good people can't die." The poet was inspired by this myth full of romanticism and wrote the first part of the long poem: "The Cart Driver's Biography." Through the image of the cart driver, the poor peasant Shi Bulan, the poem enlightens the people that only by following the Communist Party can they realize the ideal in the myth.

　　Now, the poet has written the "sequel" to "The Cart Driver's Biography." This "sequel" includes three parts: "Lan Ni," "Shi Bulan," and "Chairman Mao." They and "The Cart Driver's Biography" are combined into the first volume (the second volume has three more parts), praising the struggles of the Chinese people in the past hundred years, the leadership of the Party, the earth-shaking changes in the countryside, and the stories of the people heading to and building paradise: the original Stone Village has become a People's Commune; artificial lakes and hydroelectric power stations have been built near the Great Wall and the Sai Shang area, and a stone city, symbolizing the last fortress of feudal forces, has been submerged in the vast blue waters. Shi Bulan has become the director of the commune. Jin Buhuan, who came from a hired worker, became the county magistrate. Jin Wa, from a shepherd boy, became a soldier and married Shi Bulan's daughter, Lan Ni. These heroes, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, after a tortuous road, finally drove the cart to the earthly paradise – the People's Commune.

    首都作家的新耕耘
    本报记者　朱继功
    田汉创作“文成公主”
    著名剧作家田汉在这繁忙的间隙中，写成了解放后第五个话剧“文成公主”。
    田汉说，这个剧主要想通过文成公主同藏王松赞干布的结合，反映出汉藏人民血亲般的友谊和团结。文成公主是个胸怀大略、聪明智慧的女孩子。当她一离开长安，就想把唐代比较先进的经济、文化带到藏民中去广为传播。为创作这个剧本，老作家搜集了大量的材料，从新旧“唐书”到童话小册子的“文成公主”，以至“佛学大辞典”都认真地翻阅过了。他还访问了中国佛教协会副会长巨赞法师。过去，这位老作家写作时，只要主题酝酿成熟后，往往立即动笔，一气呵成。这次，为了刻意求精，他破例地把每场戏的提纲一个个地写出来，然后细细琢磨。
    现实主义和浪漫主义相结合，是这个剧本的特点。田汉把一些有趣的神话故事巧妙地写进了剧本。戏里，文成公主到了青海纳喇萨拉山，朔风扬沙，塞马悲鸣，引起了她无限的伤感。随员告诉公主说，这个地方叫作“倒淌川”。民间曾经流传：“过了倒淌川，另是一重天，牛羊来作伴，千里少人烟。”这句话勾动了公主的乡思，取出母后赐给的日月宝镜，忽然从镜中见到远在长安的文德皇后因思念公主病得奄奄一息，公主悲恸已极，随手摔出宝镜，镜子立刻变成了一座美丽的“日月山”。田汉说：一把相思泪，挥成日月山，剧中是这样“浪漫”了一下，但将来演出时，却要难为导演和舞台美术设计人员了！
    杨沫为林道静增写一段故事
    在定县的乡村里，垂柳青青，河水潺潺。河边传来了一阵清脆的歌声：“高粱叶子青又青，九月十八来了日本兵，先占火药库，后占北大营……”林道静正带着学生们在唱歌，反动的训育主任伍雨田过来了，林道静蹩着气，让孩子们散去。几天以后，装扮成教员模样的江华来了。林道静向这位年轻的地下党的负责人倾吐了自己的内心苦闷，江华耐心地教育她：“关心农民们的生活，你就不会觉得没有意思啦！”林道静领悟了，她逐渐地深入到群众中去。一次，凶恶的地主伍仁贵和狗腿子在田间要殴打一个无辜的农民，正巧被林道静发现了，她怒不可遏地说：“我不许你这样残酷地剥削、欺压农民！”不久，林道静掩护江华一起发动农民掀起了一个反抗大地主剥削的麦收斗争。
    “青春之歌”的作者杨沫在改编电影剧本时，发现原来小说中对林道静在农村里的革命活动写得不够，因此作了这样的补充。
    欧阳予倩的新作“黑奴吁天录”
    我国话剧史上第一个有完整剧本的话剧“黑奴吁天录”，最近由老戏剧家欧阳予倩重新编写，使它更加富有时代气息和积极的政治意义。
    五十多年前，清朝政府腐败无能，“列强”压迫中国。在日本留学的一部分中国学生组织了一个剧社——“春柳社”。他们根据美国女作家斯托的小说，美国虐待黑人的故事，编成了“黑奴吁天录”，用它来宣传民族思想。1907年6月，春柳社首次公演这个戏，受到广大观众的欢迎。几十年来，这个剧本早就遗失了。
    目前，美国的种族主义者仍然残酷地虐待黑人，帝国主义者对非洲和拉丁美洲的侵略行为变本加厉。老戏剧家欧阳予倩根据新的观点，以对殖民主义者无比愤慨、对殖民地人民深切同情的心情写成了这个戏剧。为了纪念五十年前春柳社的第一次演出，仍用“黑奴吁天录”原名。
    新剧本中，作者通过两个不可屈侮的黑人形象，揭示了被压迫人民崇高的精神面貌。戏剧的矛盾和冲突十分强烈。白人农奴主交给黑人汤姆一根鞭子，用提拔他当工头的方法，利诱他，但汤姆却拒绝了。农奴主大发雷霆地说：“你是我的奴隶，连你的灵魂都是我的”，汤姆反驳道：“你可以买到我的身体，却买不到我的灵魂，灵魂永远属于我的！”汤姆被打得不能动弹的时候，还私下帮助几个女黑奴逃跑。并且坚不吐露这些农奴逃往到哪里去了。农奴主说：“我难道降服不了你！”汤姆威武地说：“你甚么都有，就缺少一样——灵魂！”最后，汤姆牺牲了，他的反抗精神却永远鼓舞着被奴役和压迫的人民，团结起来，奔向光明！
    田间谈“赶车传”续篇
    诗人田间刚从他的“根据地”——河北怀来县花园人民公社回到北京，拿着一本长诗的样本，告诉记者说：“赶车传”的续篇即将出版了。
    1946年前后，晋察冀边区流传了一个“五不了碑”的神话。一个傍晚，敌区附近的一个村庄，忽然突起了万丈红光，人们争向前往，那红光和美丽的村庄不见了，但是一块石碑上写道：“中央军长不了。八路军走不了。大户富不了。穷人穷不了。好人死不了。”诗人受到这个富有浪漫主义色彩的神话启发，写了长诗的第一部：“赶车传”。诗篇通过赶车人贫农石不烂的形象，启示着人民只有跟着共产党走，才能实现神话中的理想。
    现在，诗人写了“赶车传”的“续篇”。这个“续篇包括“蓝妮”、“石不烂”、“毛主席”三部。它们和“赶车传”合为上卷（下卷还有三部），歌颂近百年来，中国人民的斗争，党的领导，农村翻天复地的变化，人民走向乐园和建设乐园的故事：原来的一个石头村变成了人民公社；长城附近和塞上地区有了人工湖、水电站，象征封建势力最后一个堡垒的一座石头城，已淹没在碧波万倾的湖水中。石不烂作了公社的社长。长工出身的金不换，当了县长。金娃由一个牧羊娃成了战士，和石不烂的女儿蓝妮结了婚。这些英雄在党和毛主席的领导下，经过曲折的道路，终于把车子赶到了人间乐园——人民公社。
