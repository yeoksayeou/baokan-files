     Dedication to the Motherland
    —The First Triumphant Song of the Iron and Steel Yellow River
    Ruan Zhangjing

The Yin Mountains surge and billow, like ten thousand red flags!
Our prairie honor guard, raising red flags,
Floats thousands of miles, welcoming the east wind!
The Yellow River rumbles, down from the Kunlun, rushing to the Eastern Sea!
Our iron and steel drummers, marching to the Eastern Sea,
Welcoming the sun of October rising from the great sea!
September 26th, ancient Yin Mountain, spits out the rising sun!
Molten gold overflows, red light radiates,
Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace, sings the first triumphant song,
Welcoming the tenth glorious October!
The first fountain of the iron and steel Yellow River,
Rushes red over the green fields of the Wula Mountains.
Five cold winters, six bright springs.
We obey the orders of the Motherland,
In the ancient Chielechuan, we build a steel city of fraternal unity among all ethnic groups.
Breaking through the old era's terminal station,
Driving the first bulldozer,
Opening up the old Baotou platform.
Toward the frozen earth, toward the snow and ice, toward the yellow wind, toward the wilderness,
Shoveling out a great rainbow—a thirty-kilometer iron and steel street!
Transporting red pines from Changbai Mountain, transporting yellow locust trees from Hainan Island,
Transporting friendship, transporting love,
Transporting an eternal spring, sprinkling it over the ancient borderland.
Five times the river freezes, six times the peach blossoms flood.
We obey the orders of the Motherland,
Crossing mountains and fields to deliver light.
High-voltage power lines, north across the Yin Mountains,
Welcoming the Mongolian herdsmen's songs,
Spreading over Ulanqab;
South to the ancient ferry of the Yellow River,
West to the cloud roads of Helan Mountain.
Under this vast and expansive blue sky,
Erecting a thousand-mile staff,
Creating the third movement of the iron and steel symphony!
Five times snowflakes flutter, six times spring grasses turn green.
We obey the orders of the Motherland,
Laying steel rails to the north, laying sleepers to the south,
Spreading red carpets to the deserts of the west.
Six years, six hundred miles of battlefield,
In the ancient pastoral lands, where there was nothing,
With seven-colored golden threads, embroidering a colorful picture—
A modern, automated steel capital!
To divert the unruly Yellow River water,
Dividing and clarifying it into the Baoketu.
Gales, blizzards, white-haired winds,
Several times blew the world like a spinning top!
Wind and sand, torrential rain, mountain floods,
Once seemed to put the universe into a muffled gourd!
Quicksand eyes, spewing nine-zhang yellow pus,
Mud mushrooms, trembling and arching out.
Strange and weird, bizarre and outlandish,
As if concentrating the mountain spirits of thousands of years,
Emerging endlessly to block the way!
Does the difficulty seem to collapse the sky?
These pitiful specks of dust,
Wanting to cover the war drums, will never succeed,
With a thunderous blow, they are all knocked into the Eastern Sea!
The triumphant song of the great era,
Rose in Lushan in August.
The Eighth Plenary Session is like a solar corona,
Surging up the sun of human history!
Long live the People's Commune! Long live, long live!
Rushing out of towering mountains, shaking the sea, shaking the ocean.
The steelmaking movement is very good,
Bringing steel factories like a sky full of stars.
Right-leaning gentlemen, please take a look:
Last year, with a surge of progress,
The prairie steel capital was born, with two little phoenixes—
One called Little Baotou Steel, one called Central Baotou Steel!
The Lushan Conference, radiating brilliance!
Shines red in space, illuminating the grasslands.
The Third Army of 80,000 steelmakers,
Carrying welding rods and pliers,
Like the Qiantang River tide in August,
Surging on the main battlefield of the blast furnace.
In the dazzling sea of lights and electric sparks,
Writing a letter to the great leader Mao Zedong:
To produce iron ahead of schedule to welcome October,
To call Yin Mountain red all night ahead of schedule!
Signing pens are like valves,
The stroke connects to a great source of light,
The strength to move mountains and drain seas, instantly fills the whole body!
A louder leap forward horn, shakes the morning sky,
A more intense leap forward drum, moves the prairie,
The Yin Mountains tremble, the Yellow River sways!
Wind, fire, thunder, electricity, water,
In the sky, on the ground, underground,
Vertical, three-dimensional, up and down, intersecting,
Twisting time for a great decisive battle!
Arc light illuminates the purple Wula Mountains.
September 26th, ancient Yin Mountain, spits out the rising sun!
Molten gold overflows, red light radiates,
Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace, sings a red triumphant song,
Welcoming the tenth glorious October!
Imperialist cold worms:
Whose iron and steel setbacks are these?
Please look at the members of the People's Commune,
Sitting in tractors, rubber-wheeled carts,
Coming to see the great Baotou Steel, producing its first furnace of iron!
Special thieves who steal and rob cultural relics,
Your country's museums have vacancies,
We offer an old ox cart,
Let you recite "Amen" for it,
Muttering, "The Chinese Communist Party, quickly eliminate all these treasures!"
The 80,000 builders of Baotou Steel,
Singing triumphant songs to welcome October!
Holding the first blast furnace model cast from the first furnace of black gold,
Dedicated to the great leader, the great Party!
Thank you for your trust, our great Motherland!
The Liaodong Peninsula, previously dedicated Angang!
The Yangtze River dedicated Wuhan Steel last year!
The Yellow River dedicates Baotou Steel this year!
The Qilian Mountains in the Northwest will dedicate the fourth steel!
Min River, Fen River, Yongding River,
Pearl River, Shanghai River, Yarlung Zangbo River,
How many rivers and mountains does the great Motherland have!
One mountain, one river, one river dedicated one,
Arranged into a steel Great Wall reaching the Milky Way!
Rumble, rumble, rumble, the sound of the wheels of the sun of history,
Silences the strange noise of the cold insects at the end of autumn!
Rumble, rumble, rumble, the sound of the wheels carrying the spring of mankind,
Will knock open the doors of every planet!
