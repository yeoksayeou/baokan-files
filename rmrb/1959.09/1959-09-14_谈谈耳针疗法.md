Talking about Auricular Acupuncture Therapy
Beijing Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine

In China's medical heritage, there are many methods to protect the people's life and health, and to treat the people's diseases. Acupuncture is one of the effective methods. Auricular acupuncture therapy is a type of acupuncture therapy.

Auricular acupuncture therapy, as the name suggests, is a method of treating diseases by using needles to puncture the ear. The human ear is divided into two parts: the inner ear and the outer ear (the latter is called the auricle). The area punctured is the outer ear on both sides of the head. The entire auricle is covered by skin, and besides blood vessels, nerves, connective tissue and a small amount of muscle fibers, the upper two-thirds mainly consists of cartilage (which is the main part constituting the shape of the auricle), and the lower third mainly consists of the auricle lobe containing adipose tissue. The entire auricle is covered by skin containing blood vessels and nerves.

In Chinese medicine, the ear is not only considered an organ of hearing, but also closely related to the meridians of the whole body. For example, the "Ling Shu: Evil Qi, Zang-fu and Disease Forms" says: "The twelve meridians, three hundred and sixty-five collaterals, their qi all ascends to the face and goes through the orifices... their separate qi goes to the ear for hearing." The "Su Wen: Miscellaneous Punctures" says: "Evil invades the shaoyang and taiyang of the hand and foot, and the yangming collaterals of the foot, these five collaterals all meet in the ear, and ascend to connect with the left corner." The "Su Wen: Treatise on Heat" says: "Shaoyang governs the gallbladder, its meridian circulates the ribs and connects with the ear..." The "Ling Shu: Oral Questions" says: "The ear is where the zong mai gather..." Therefore, puncturing the outer ear can reflect to the whole body through the meridians, and treat a number of diseases throughout the body.

Regarding the records of treating diseases in other parts of the body by puncturing the ear, there was an introduction in Ge Hong's "Elbow Formulas" in the Jin Dynasty. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" quoted Chen Cangqi's formula from the Tang Dynasty: "For malaria with eye redness and yellowing, take snake slough and plug both ears." Wu Kexian in the Qing Dynasty recorded in his "Theory of Parallelism" that he used Pinellia and snake slough to plug the ears to treat shaoyang malaria. Yang Jizhou in the Ming Dynasty recorded in his "Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion" that moxibustion with moxa cones on ear inflammation can treat white翳growing in the eye.

In Chinese folk medicine, there are also widely circulated methods of treating diseases in other parts of the body by puncturing the ears. For example, puncturing the back of the ear to bleed to treat eye diseases, and puncturing the helix to treat acute tonsillitis. In the Qing Dynasty, there was an old Chinese medicine doctor named Sun in Yuncheng, Shanxi, who specialized in using this method to treat diseases and was very popular among the people. Dr. Paul Nogier, a French doctor of medicine, also studied China's auricular acupuncture therapy. He determined the reaction points or reaction areas on the auricle for various parts of the human body and internal organs, and pointed out that when the body's surface or internal organs have lesions, puncturing these reaction points can treat certain diseases. Recently, medical workers in Shanghai, Shanxi and other parts of China have conducted further research based on the achievements of past domestic and foreign research on auricular acupuncture, supplemented some effective acupuncture points, created ring-shaped needles suitable for ear retention, and some places have further studied the use of meridian measuring instruments to find reaction points. This therapy has its indications in various departments for the treatment of diseases. Up to now, more than forty or fifty kinds of diseases have been reported at home and abroad to be treated with auricular acupuncture, such as pain caused by acute inflammation, traumatic pain, stomach pain, acute abdominal pain, asthma, hypertension, neurasthenia, skin diseases, etc. It is particularly effective for pain. Generally speaking, its therapeutic effect on acute pain is better than that on chronic pain, and the effect on traumatic pain is even more significant. In addition, it also has certain effects in reducing inflammation, swelling, and fever. Up to now, the practical application of auricular acupuncture in various places mainly adopts two basic forms: filiform needle acupuncture and intradermal needle retention. At present, we only use ordinary medical needles. However, intradermal needle retention is a new creation in China's medical community, which uses spiral needles to stay in the skin. Both can be used for various indications, but for those who need long-term needle retention treatment, intradermal needle retention is more convenient. Sometimes the two acupuncture methods should be combined. Filiform needle acupuncture can generally retain the needle for 20 to 60 minutes, and intradermal needle retention can be retained from one day to seven days. If necessary, the retention time of both can be extended to consolidate the curative effect.

The nature of the reaction points is mainly pain, but there are also those who feel numb, swollen, or crawling. It should be noted that when measuring, do not stick to one end, and always take the most sensitive reaction as the standard.

Through our practice, we believe that auricular acupuncture is simple, easy to learn, easy to master and promote, and it does have a certain curative effect for certain diseases. It is also economical and saves money. It is a treatment method that is suitable for achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and is more suitable for use in basic medical units.

In late April, we formed an acupuncture medical team to go to a construction site. After introducing this therapy to the local medical staff in a very short time, they were able to master and apply it in the same way. There were two patients with acute conjunctivitis and acute herpes conjunctivitis, respectively, with eye pain that prevented them from seeing objects. One of them even tripped and fell when entering the clinic. After one acupuncture treatment, the pain stopped and they could open their eyes and see things, and the congestion was also reduced. The herpes disappeared after two acupuncture treatments. A patient with acute cholecystitis, after filiform needle acupuncture, said that the abdominal pain disappeared in less than a few minutes, and the pain did not recur during the needle retention period. The filiform needle fell off at night, and the patient had abdominal pain again. At that time, the filiform needle was inserted at the original acupuncture point, and the abdominal pain disappeared immediately. A trauma patient fell from a high place three days ago and his waist hit a stone, causing severe pain. He had difficulty walking and could not work. Painkillers were ineffective, but after filiform needle acupuncture, the waist pain was significantly reduced after 20 minutes. Two hours later, the patient no longer felt any discomfort when pressing on the waist with his hand. In order to consolidate the treatment effect, he changed to intradermal needle retention, and the next day he had fully recovered his labor force. The use of auricular acupuncture therapy not only does not affect other therapies, but also can play an auxiliary role. For example, when treating rheumatism, the combination of auricular acupuncture and traditional acupuncture has a more significant effect. According to the statistics of treatment of more than 400 cases, the effective rate for more than 30 kinds of diseases is 87.3%, and most of them are effective after one or two treatments.

In addition to clinical treatment, auricular acupuncture therapy also has a certain value in diagnosis. Sometimes the diagnosis is not clear, and reaction points can also be explored on the auricle. According to the reaction point appearing in which viscera, distribution area or body surface part, and then inferring back to the corresponding viscera or body surface, it can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic method. When the body has certain lesions but no obvious clinical symptoms, a comprehensive examination of the auricle can reveal whether there is a disease, which also has a certain effect on early treatment. In addition, to prevent the onset of asthma, acupuncture can also be performed in advance on the previously confirmed reaction points.

The reason why auricular acupuncture therapy can cure diseases is not yet clear, and this is a topic that should be studied at present. However, as it stands, if we use it more widely to treat some diseases that have been proven by practice to be treatable, it will play a certain role in relieving the pain of more people and ensuring people's health.

    谈谈耳针疗法
    北京中医研究院
    在我国医学遗产中，保护人民生命健康，医治人民疾病的方法是多种多样的，针灸疗法是其中的有效方法之一。耳针疗法就是针灸疗法的一种。
    耳针疗法，顾名思义，就是利用针刺耳部来进行治疗疾病的方法。人的耳朵分内耳与外耳两部（后者称为耳廓）。针刺的部位就是头两侧的外耳部。整个耳廓外包皮肤，除了血管神经，结缔组织及少许肌肉纤维以外，上三分之二里面主要是软骨（为构成耳廓外形的主要部分），下三分之一主要是含有脂肪组织的?襞。整个耳廓都是外包皮肤内含血管神经。
    在我国的医学中，不仅认为耳是听觉器官，而且，还认为它和全身的经络有着密切的联系，如灵枢邪气藏府病形篇说：“十二经脉，三百六十五络，其气皆上于面，而走其空窍……其别气走于耳为听。”素问缪刺论说：“邪客于手足少阳、太阳、足阳明之络，此五络皆会于耳中，上络左角。”素问热论说：“少阳主胆，其脉循胁络于耳……。”灵枢口问篇说：“耳者宗脉之所聚也……。”因此，针刺外耳，就可以通过经络反应到全身，而治疗周身的若干疾病。
    关于针刺耳部治疗其他部位的疾病的记载，溯自晋朝葛洪的时后方中，早有介绍。本草纲目中引唐朝陈藏器方说：“疟正目黄，取蛇蜕塞两耳。”清朝的吴可先在他的理论骈文中，记载了用半夏、蛇蜕塞耳治少阳疟疾。明朝杨继洲在他的针灸大成中，曾记载用艾炷灸耳炎，可以治目生白翳。
    在我国民间也普遍流传有以针刺耳朵来治疗其他部位疾病的方法。如针刺耳背出血治疗眼病，针刺耳轮治疗急性扁桃体炎等。在清朝，在山西运城有一位姓孙的老中医就专门用这种方法治病，很受群众欢迎。法国医学博士欧格尔氏对于我国的耳针疗法也进行了研究。他确定人体各部和内藏器官在耳廓上的反应点或反应区，并指出机体的体表部分或内藏器官有病变时，针刺这种反应点，就可治疗某些疾病。近来，我国上海、山西等各地医务工作者，根据过去国内外对耳针研究已获得的成果，又进行了进一步钻研，充补了一些有效的针刺点；创造了适合耳部留针用的环形针；有的地方还进一步研究利用经络测定仪来探找反应点。这种疗法，在治疗疾病方面，各科都有它的适应症。到目前为止，国内外发表利用耳针治疗的疾病，约有四五十种以上，如急性炎症所引起的疼痛，外伤性疼痛，胃脘症，急腹症，哮喘，高血压症，神经衰弱症，皮肤病等。特别是对于疼痛有显著的疗效。一般是它治疗急性疼痛的疗效比治疗慢性疼痛的效果好，对于外伤性疼痛的效果就更为显著。此外，在消炎、消肿、解热等方面，也有一定的效果。到目前为止，各地对耳针疗法的实际应用，大体上采用有毫针刺法和皮内留针法等两种基本形式。目前我们只使用一般医针。但皮内留针法是我国医务界的新创举，是用螺旋形针留于皮内。两者都可以用于各种适应症，不过需要长期留针治疗的，则以皮内留针法较为方便。有时两种针法要结合起来应用。毫针刺法一般可留针二十分钟到六十分钟，皮内留针可由一天留至到七天。必要时，两者的留针时间均可延长，以巩固疗效。
    反应点的性质，虽以疼痛为主，但也有发麻或胀或串走者，应该注意，在测定时不可拘泥一端，总以反应最敏者为是。
    通过我们的实践，认为耳针疗法简便易学，容易掌握和推广，对于某些疾病确有一定的疗效。且也经济省钱，是适合多快好省的一种治疗方法，更适于基层医疗单位使用。
    我们在4月下旬，曾组成针灸医疗队到某工地去，就用很短的时间把这种疗法介绍给当地医务工作者以后，他们也一样地能掌握运用。有急性结膜炎和急性泡疹性结膜炎患者各一名，眼痛不能见物，其中一人走入诊室时还跌了一跤。经一次针治后即痛止，且能开目视物，冲血也减轻，针二次后泡疹也消失了。有一急性胆囊炎患者，用毫针刺法后，不到数分钟，即述腹痛消失，留针期间未再发，夜间毫针脱落，病人又腹痛，当时即在原有的针刺点上刺入毫针，腹痛又立即消失。有一外伤患者三天前由高处摔下，腰跌在石头上，剧痛，走路困难，不能工作，服止痛药无效，而用毫针针刺，二十分钟后腰痛显著减轻，二小时后即用手压迫腰部，患者已无所苦，为了巩固治疗效果，遂改用皮内留针，次日已完全恢复劳动力。采用耳针疗法，不但不影响其他疗法，且能起辅助作用。如治疗风湿症时，耳针疗法和传统针灸并用，其效果更为显著。据对四百多病例治疗的统计，对三十多种疾病的有效率占87.3％，而其中多在一两次后奏效。
    耳针疗法除了临床治病外，在诊断上也有一定价值。有时诊断尚未明确，也可在耳廓上探找反应点。根据反应点出现在那个脏腑，分布区或那个体表部位，再反而推及相应的脏腑或体表，从而可以做为一种辅助的诊断法。当机体有某些病变，但无明显的临床症状时，在耳廓上进行全面的检查，可以发现有无疾病，对早期治疗上也有一定的作用。此外，对预防哮喘病的发作，也可事先针刺于曾经证实过的反应点上。
    耳针疗法能治病的道理，还不太清楚，这是目前应该加以研究的课题。但是，就在目前来说，如果更广泛地运用它去治疗已为实践证明了可以治疗的一些疾病，对于解除更多人的疾病痛苦和保障人民健康是会起一定作用的。
