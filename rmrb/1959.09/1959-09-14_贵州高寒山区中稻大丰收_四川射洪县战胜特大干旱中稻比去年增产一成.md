Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 13th: In the first autumn harvest after communization, mountainous areas in Guizhou Province inhabited by ethnic minorities are joyfully reporting large-scale high-yield bumper harvests of mid-season rice everywhere. The already harvested mid-season rice in the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture has yields of 800-900 catties per mu, even over 1000 catties per mu. The lowest yields are 600-700 catties, generally an increase of 20% to 50% compared to last year. In the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the average yield of over 70,000 mu of mid-season rice harvested by early September reached 639 catties. Jianhe County, deep in the Miao Mountains, had harvested 14,811 mu by September 5th, with an average yield of 1,187 catties per mu, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year's extraordinarily good harvest; the highest yield record reached 2,864 catties per mu. In Liping County, on the southeastern corner of Guizhou bordering Guangxi and Hunan, Dong commune members harvested over 8,000 mu of rice by the end of August, with an average yield of 823 catties per mu. Many communes have surpassed their contracted production targets. In Wangmo County, a Buyi ethnic area in the south, the first batch of 6,100 mu of mid-season rice harvested averaged 700 catties per mu, an increase of nearly 30% compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 13th: Shehong County, Sichuan, fully utilized the unparalleled power of the people's communes, overcame a severe drought unseen in decades, and achieved a bumper harvest of mid-season rice. Currently, all 120,000 mu of mid-season rice in the county have been harvested. After verification at all levels, the average yield per mu has increased by more than 10% compared to last year. Due to the expansion of the planting area, the total output has increased by 65%. By the end of August, the county had completed its annual grain purchase quota.

Shehong is a severely affected county in the Mianyang Special Zone of Sichuan Province, which suffered greatly from the drought. Since the beginning of this year, rainfall has been unusually scarce. Faced with this extraordinary disaster, the county's forty-eight people's communes quickly concentrated 250,000 people into an anti-drought army and plunged into the struggle against the drought. During the most severe period of the drought, men and women commune members throughout the county diverted water from the Fujiang, Zijiang, and Kaijiang rivers from 238 locations, up the hillsides, and irrigated more than 35,000 mu of cracked fields. Communes and teams also widely carried out large-scale cooperation. Due to mutual support and the large number of people involved, they rescued all the mid-season rice from the harm of the drought.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 13th: Fumin People's Commune in Fumin County, Yunnan, overcame natural disasters. As of the 8th of this month, over 1,400 mu out of 34,000 mu of rice had been harvested. After drying, winnowing, and verification, the average yield per mu was 1,016 catties and seven taels, an increase of about 10% compared to the bumper harvest of 1958. The 13,678 mu of wheat harvested by this commune this summer, after verification, yielded an average of 521 catties and one tael per mu, more than double last year's yield.
