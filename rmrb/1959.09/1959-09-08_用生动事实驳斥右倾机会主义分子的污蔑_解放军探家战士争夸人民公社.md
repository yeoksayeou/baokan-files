Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Recently, some units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army organized forums for cadres and soldiers who had returned from home visits to discuss their impressions of the people's communes. Many cadres and soldiers praised the people's communes, using many vivid facts they had personally witnessed to refute the nonsense of right-opportunist elements who slanderously claimed that the people's communes were "established too early" and "managed badly."

    PLA soldiers who love to boast about their hometowns all said after returning from their visits that the large-scale water conservancy projects undertaken by the people's communes have brought so many benefits to their hometowns. Song Dayuan, a cadet at the Naval Preparatory School from Yancheng, Jiangsu, said: "When I got home, it hadn't rained for thirty or forty days. The commune mobilized a large number of people and pumps to fight the drought. I went to see three management areas, and each area had seven or eight pumps, pumping water day and night; in just a few days, the drought was relieved." Wang Ruifeng, the political instructor of a certain company on the Fujian front, whose home is in Qingyun County, Hebei, said: "Our hometown, within an eighteen-mile radius, is a well-known 'Eighteen Bitter Villages'. The bitter villages were truly bitter; not to mention watering the fields, even drinking water was difficult. During the period of agricultural cooperatives, many wells were dug, but the problem was still not solved; it wasn't until after communization that tens of thousands of people were organized to build water conservancy projects, bringing water from afar, that the 'Eighteen Bitter Villages' were truly no longer bitter. People call this water 'Happiness Water', and when they use this water to irrigate wheat and fields, they talk about the benefits of the commune. One of my old uncles, who is over seventy years old, said: 'After the people's commune was established, the river water flowed according to the old man's wishes.'"

    Many people, after returning from their visits home, greatly praised the communes for running industries and developing sideline occupations, which changed the face of their hometowns and improved the lives of the peasants. Lin Hui, a new soldier from Nan'ya, northern Fujian, said: "Nan'ya not only built water conservancy projects, with small canals running high up the mountains, but also built a power station. If it weren't for communization, how could the peasants have been able to build this!" Squad leader Yi Qikong, who is from Yichun, Jiangxi, said that his hometown produces oil-tea. He said: "When I saw the neat and tidy oil-tea mountains with lush branches and leaves at home, I loved the commune from the bottom of my heart. Because the commune members did a good job of digging mountains and loosening the soil, the oil-tea branches were big and the leaves were fat this year, and the fruit was plentiful and large. Now, harvesting oil-tea is no longer like in the past, when it couldn't be harvested due to a lack of manpower, leaving it all over the mountains."

    After communization, the vigorous development of rural culture and education has been praised by many cadres and soldiers. Zhang Zhiyi, a cultural instructor of a certain company from Xianju County, Zhejiang, said: "In the past, there were few schools in our area, and many young people wanted to study, but there was not enough space. Moreover, running to school was quite troublesome; those going to junior high school had to run dozens of miles, and those going to high school had to run more than a hundred miles. Now, the commune makes unified arrangements, expanding primary schools and adding junior and senior high schools. The schools are all at the doorstep, and the number of students enrolled has doubled compared to the past."

    What moved the cadres and soldiers of the army even more was that after communization, their mothers, wives, and sisters were all liberated from housework such as cooking and washing dishes, and became good production team members. Guo Zhongxiao, a squad leader of a certain company on the Fujian front, said that his mother used to spend all day around the stove, busy cooking meals, sewing and washing, but now she eats in the canteen and his mother works as a feeder for the commune. His mother said to him: "I have only been truly liberated since the establishment of the commune." Gu Tonghai, a soldier from a certain unit of the Beijing troops who enlisted in 1956, saw when he visited home in the spring that his sister-in-law used to take care of five or six children, but now the children are sent to kindergartens and nurseries, and his sister-in-law has joined the labor force, earning more than fifty yuan in wages this spring. Gu Tonghai's brother said: "The people's commune is truly a thousand times good. Look at everyone in our family, on the kang, what isn't new? You can serve with peace of mind, don't worry about the family, and don't send money home."

    用生动事实驳斥右倾机会主义分子的污蔑
    解放军探家战士争夸人民公社
    据新华社7日讯　中国人民解放军中，最近有些部队组织了探家归队的干部、战士座谈会，畅谈对人民公社的观感。许多干部、战士都夸人民公社好，他们以自己亲眼看到的许多生动事实，驳斥了右倾机会主义分子污蔑人民公社“办早了”、“办糟了”的胡说。
    爱夸家乡的部队战士，探家归队后都说，人民公社大办水利，给他们家乡带来的好处真是多。家在江苏盐城的海军预备学校学员宋大元说：“我到家的时候，已经有三四十天不下雨了。公社调了大批人和抽水机抗旱。我跑了三个管理区去看，每个区都有七、八部抽水机，日日夜夜抽水浇地；仅仅几天，就解除了旱象。”家在河北庆云县的福建前线某连指导员王锐锋说：“我们家乡方圆十八里，是有名的‘十八苦村’。苦村真是苦，莫说是用水浇地，就是吃水都很困难。农业合作社时期打了不少井，仍然没有解决问题；直到公社化以后，组织了成千上万的人去修水利，将水从远方引来，‘十八苦村’才真正不苦了。人们都管这水叫‘幸福水’，用这水浇麦浇地的时候，人们就念叨起公社的好处。我的一个七十多岁的老叔说：办起了人民公社，河水也随着老汉的心意流起来。”
    许多人探家归队后，都大大称赞公社办工业、发展副业，改变了家乡的面貌，改善了农民的生活。闽北南雅新战士林徽说：“南雅不光是兴办了水利工程，小渠爬高满山跑，还建立了发电站。不是公社化，农民怎能办得起这个呀！”班长易其孔，是江西宜春人，他们家乡出油茶。他说：“在家看到整整齐齐、枝叶繁盛的油茶山，就从心眼爱公社。由于公社社员掘山松土搞得好，今年油茶枝大叶肥，结实又多又大。如今采油茶，再也不像过去因人手缺乏采不及，落得满山都是了。”
    公社化以后，农村的文化教育蓬蓬勃勃的发展，受到干部战士许多夸奖。家在浙江仙居县的某连文化教员张植义说：“过去我们那个地方，学校少，求学的青年多，容纳不下。而且上学跑路也够麻烦的，上初中的要跑几十里，上高中的要跑到一百多里外。现在公社统一安排，扩建了小学，增设了初中、高中，学校都在家门口，入学的也比从前增多了一倍。”
    更使部队干部、战士感动的是，公社化以后，他们的母亲、妻子、姐妹都从做饭洗碗等家务劳动中解放出来，成了很好的生产队员。福建前线某连班长郭忠校说，他母亲过去整天围着锅台转，忙饭做菜，缝缝洗洗，如今吃饭去食堂，母亲作了公社的饲养员。母亲对他说：“公社成立后，我才算真正解放了。”北京部队某部1956年入伍的战士谷同海，春天探家时看到，他嫂嫂过去带五、六个孩子，如今孩子送进了幼儿园、托儿所，嫂嫂参加了劳动，今春得了五十多元的工资。谷同海的哥哥说：“人民公社真是一千个好也说不完。你看咱家人的身上、炕上，那样不是新的？你安心服役吧，不要惦着家，也不要往家寄钱了。”
