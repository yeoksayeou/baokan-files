The National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition (1949-1959) has opened.

This exhibition is a microcosm of the great achievements China has made in industry and transportation over the past decade and ironclad proof of the Great Leap Forward of last year and this year.

Entering the glittering archway of the Beijing Exhibition Center, the first thing that stops visitors in their tracks is two charts that will be recorded in China's history - charts showing the high-speed development of China's industry and transportation over the past decade. The numbers on the charts, no, they are not ordinary numbers, they are an epic of China's rush towards an industrial country. They tell people that this year's steel production is seventy-five times higher than in 1949, machine tools have increased thirty-seven times, and heavy industrial products such as coal, petroleum, chemical fertilizers, and cement have all increased ten to dozens of times. Light industrial products such as cotton yarn, sugar, and paper have also increased four to eight times or more. The national transportation volume has increased several times, and railway lines and highways have also stretched to all parts of the motherland at a high speed of more than 10,000 kilometers and more than 300,000 kilometers respectively. The two lines of numbers for 1958 and 1959 on the chart are written in dazzling red, like the emphasis added to this epic. It shows an important conclusion: The Great Leap Forward has ushered in a new era of unprecedented high-speed development for China's industry and transportation. During China's first five-year plan, the average annual industrial development rate was 18%, which was already a rare high speed. However, after the construction of China's first five-year plan and the substantial increase in the base, industry in 1958 increased by 66%, and this year it will increase by 25.6% compared to last year. The growth rate in these two years has greatly exceeded the average annual growth rate during the first five-year plan. In terms of the output of major industrial products, the increase in China's steel, iron, and coal in 1958 all exceeded the total increase in the five years of the first five-year plan. On the basis of such a great leap forward, the increase in steel, iron, and coal this year will still exceed or equal the total increase during the first five-year plan. Due to the leap forward in the past two years, the main indicators of China's second five-year plan in the industrial field will be completed three years ahead of schedule this year, and the planned targets for coal, metallurgical equipment, cement, power machinery, salt, and paper have been successively declared completed last year and this year.

Turning east from the archway, you enter the world of metal - the Metallurgical Industry Hall. Most of the metals discovered in the world are displayed here. In the center of the hall stands a model of a huge alloy steel ingot produced in China this year. It is a symbol of the continuous Great Leap Forward in China's iron and steel industry this year. It is six and a half meters tall and surprisingly thick. If its top is cut flat, ten people can sit on it for a meeting. Such a large steel ingot is three times the size of the sensational large steel ingot exhibited here last year, and it weighs one hundred and twenty tons. China's ability to cast such large steel ingots provides the necessary forgings for China to manufacture many heavy machines. On one side of this huge steel ingot model, there are various seamless steel pipes as thick as bowls and as thin as embroidery needles, steel plates thicker than two bricks and steel strips as thin as carbon paper, and hundreds of types of steel ranging from the Yangtze River Bridge to the steel windows. In front of these surprisingly large and incredibly thin steel products, people cannot help but generate passion for the Great Leap Forward. Because most of them were born in the Great Leap Forward last year and this year. Behind the large steel ingot is a sparkling non-ferrous metal and alloy steel. This is the essence of the iron and steel industry. Here, there is a six-meter-high, one-and-a-half-meter-wide, and thirty-millimeter-thick large aluminum ingot, like a silver glittering gate. Next to it is aluminum material processed into hundreds of cross-sections, showing the great leap forward in China's aluminum industry. Here, you can also see the most difficult to refine titanium, zirconium, vanadium, tungsten, and molybdenum, and rare metals such as thorium, lithium, and beryllium, which are important raw materials and materials for the atomic industry, and also germanium and silicon used as semiconductors. The purity of germanium and silicon has reached a level where there is only about one part per hundred million of impurities, and germanium and silicon have been made into single crystal structures (made into single crystal structures to be used as semiconductors). Because we have fully utilized China's rich mineral resources such as silicon, vanadium, molybdenum, titanium, tungsten, and boron, China has established its own alloy steel system and can smelt hundreds of types of alloy steel.

In the central hall of the exhibition hall are machine tools and other products of the machinery industry. Among a series of precision machine tools on display, there is a large coordinate boring machine that imperialism "banned" from China, a fully automated six-axis machine tool, a high-precision gear hobbing machine, and a hexagonal bed with a "pre-selection" device. This machine tool with a pre-selection device is equipped with more than a dozen cutting tools and can process various shaft parts. This machine tool can work non-stop according to the work procedures and tasks specified by the workers. One person can use more than a dozen of these machine tools to produce. The vertical lathe exhibited here is much larger than the one exhibited last year, and it can process machine parts with a diameter of 3.4 meters. Because of its tall body, workers must climb the specially designed steel ladder next to it to reach its operating platform. In a corner of the hall, there is a strange machine tool that does not produce the iron filings cut off by ordinary machine tools, nor does it hear the rustling sound of gear grinders. It has no cutting tools, but it can process the world's hardest alloy steel into molds for various complex machine parts. It uses a strong current to pass through a copper electrode "cutting tool" for processing. When this machine tool works, the surface of the mold steel being processed is immediately melted like a gas and disappears into thin air. This machine tool is the new electric pulse forming perforation machine tool made this year. Another ultrasonic machine tool used for making molds is also very peculiar. It can not only process any metal, but also process non-metals such as marble and glass. Its "cutting tool" is emery particles. After the machine tool is started, the nickel "transducer" vibrates 25,000 times per second and hits the emery, and the emery attacks the mold being processed at the same speed. Because the "transducer" vibrates so fast that it is impossible to see with the naked eye, it seems to be still when it works, and only sings a subtle chirping song. The birth of these two machine tools is a flower in the leap forward of China's machine tool industry this year. It has opened up new ways for China's machinery industry to replace manual mold making with machinery. In the hall also lies the rotor of a 72,500-kilowatt hydraulic turbine generator. China will use this large generator to build large power stations such as the Xin'anjiang. Here also lies the rotor of a 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine and steam turbine generator representing China's manufacturing. The narrator told us that it only took China four years from producing a 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in 1954 to producing a 50,000-kilowatt thermal power equipment this year, while it took Britain sixty-four years. In the side halls on both sides of the hall are various precision instruments and radio industry products. Among them are 100,000-fold electron microscopes; balances with a sensitivity of one millionth of a gram, which are sensitive to 1% of the weight of a hair; and 250-kilowatt high-power transmitting tubes. The power of such an electronic tube is three times greater than the power of all the transmitting tubes of the Kuomintang Central Broadcasting Station before the Anti-Japanese War. Among the machinery exhibited on the east and west squares on both sides of the hall, there is a Cyclone-25 helicopter that looks like a dragonfly. This aircraft is very useful in transportation, agriculture, forestry, fishery, and life saving. It can take off and land on squares, grasslands, ship decks, and even the flat roofs of buildings. If it is equipped with snow skis or pontoons, it can also take off and land on snow, ice, and water. The exhibits also include rolling mill rolls and frames for rolling mills that can process 3.2 million tons of steel billets per year, Hongqi brand high-end sedans produced with the latest technology, and various tractors. These products show that China's metallurgical equipment, automobile, tractor, and aircraft manufacturing industries have a fairly advanced technical level. If you pay attention, the largest and most precise products were also born in the Great Leap Forward last year and this year.

Walking into the Coal Industry Hall, the red arrows embedded in the huge coal blocks make people see how fast China's coal industry is leaping forward: the development of China's coal industry in ten years has surpassed the seventy years of old China and is equivalent to more than sixty years in Britain. On the circular product platform of the Petroleum Industry Hall, more than 200 kinds of petroleum products are dazzling. A red arrow rising in a straight line in front of the platform tells people that China's oil production in 1959 (planned) increased by 28 times compared to 1949. Entering the Chemical Industry Hall, people immediately feel that "people cannot live without chemistry." Here are beautiful plastics used in various national constructions and household goods, reactive dyes that have reached international standards in terms of quality, and fertilizers and pesticides that serve agriculture. The description of the exhibits states that China's fertilizers have developed from one type ten years ago to more than twenty types, and the output (1958) has increased by thirty times. Pesticides have increased from ten types ten years ago to 157 types, of which more than 60 types are produced in large quantities. The increase in the output of fertilizers and pesticides has promoted the great harvest of agriculture in China.

In the always attractive Atomic Energy Hall, models of China's first experimental heavy water atomic reactor and accelerator are exhibited. This reactor and cyclotron were the seeds of peaceful use of atomic energy sown by the Soviet Union to help China in 1958, and now they have blossomed and borne fruit. According to the cyclotron built with Soviet assistance, China is manufacturing various accelerators. The atomic reactor put into production in China has not only carried out important atomic physics research, but also produced more than 30 kinds of radioactive isotopes. The pictures, models, and objects exhibited here show that China has applied radioactive isotopes to industrial sectors such as petroleum, geology, coal, metallurgy, machinery, and chemical industry, as well as medical and agricultural scientific research. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other nine cities have used isotopes for diagnosis, treatment and medical research. Plant science research institutions have also used isotope research to help crop growth and summarize the experience of great agricultural harvest, and have achieved valuable results. What is particularly gratifying is the various types of atomic nuclear latex made in China exhibited here. It is a very important tool for studying cosmic rays and basic particles. Its quality can already be compared with the products of the British "Ilford" company, which has the best latex quality in the capitalist world.

In the center of the Geological Hall, there is a rockery covered with various ores, symbolizing China's "beautiful landscape and rich mineral resources." It shows that old China only explored 18 kinds of minerals in more than 50 years, while new China has proven 88 kinds of minerals in ten years. The proven minerals of tungsten, tin, molybdenum, antimony, iron, manganese, aluminum, lead, copper, mercury, coal, etc. in China prove that China is a country with considerable reserves of these minerals in the world. After visiting the Geological Hall, it seems that we have made a perspective on the land of our motherland. The result of the perspective is: we completely own the strong reserve resources to ensure the continued high-speed development of China's industry in the future.

Climbing up the building in the central hall is like entering a large garden where hundreds of flowers are blooming and strange flowers are competing for beauty. Here, various beautiful textiles and light industrial products show the beautiful scenery of the lives of the Chinese people. Here are silk, satin, damask, and gauze, which are world-renowned, various knitwear and printed fabrics loved by the working people, and various daily necessities, decorations, and so on. The output of these products has doubled compared to ten years ago. Seeing the various kinds of paper here, it is easy to evoke middle-aged people's memories of their own use of paper ten years ago: At that time, due to the dumping of American goods, China's paper industry was dying, and even toilet paper was labeled with the U.S.A. trademark. Today, people can see various high-grade papers produced in China here: some can be used to record heartbeats and the operation of artificial satellites, some can be used to detect ocean depths and fish schools in the ocean, some can allow you to see the handwriting of relatives and friends who send you telegrams, and some can be used as insulation jackets for 400,000-volt high-voltage cables.

Entering the Railway and Transportation Hall is like entering a transportation station leading to any place in the motherland. More than 30,000 kilometers of railways, 400,000 kilometers of highway network, air routes connecting the whole country, and more than 150,000 kilometers of inland waterways constitute the main arteries of our motherland. The rapid growth of freight and passenger traffic in various transportation departments shows that the great development of transportation has promoted the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, strengthened the worker-peasant alliance, and promoted national prosperity. Here, the arduous project of opening up the Qinling Mountains to build the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and building this railway into China's first electrified railway, and the miracle of building more than 10,000 kilometers of highways on the roof of the world, are also presented to people through models and pictures.

Countless facts at the exhibition show that it is precisely because of the correct leadership of the Party, the Party's general line, and a series of correct policies of "walking on two legs" that China has been able to leap towards an industrial country at a high speed for the past ten years. Take the mass steelmaking, which the domestic and foreign reactionaries and domestic right-leaning opportunists believe has been "screwed up"! The objects and charts exhibited in the Metallurgical Hall tell people that from the mass steelmaking last year to the beginning of this year, the volume of small indigenous blast furnaces built in China in a few months reached 43,000 cubic meters. These small blast furnaces will produce 10 million tons of pig iron suitable for steelmaking and casting this year. The production level reached by the small blast furnaces we built in a few months (only small blast furnaces!) was not achieved in a hundred years in old China! It took the United States more than ten years and Britain more than eighty years to increase iron production by 10 million tons on the basis of the same production level as China. During the same period as the construction of the above-mentioned small blast furnaces, the converter volume built in China reached 1,400 tons. Which capitalist country can compare with such a high-speed increase in steelmaking capacity? In the machinery, coal, and all other halls, vivid facts also prove that the correct leadership of the Party is the fundamental reason for the high-speed development of China's industry and transportation. After visiting the great achievements of China's ten-year industrial and transportation undertakings exhibited at the exhibition and strolling out of the archway of the exhibition hall, a slogan in the archway once again shows people the magnificent prospects of China's industry in the next ten years: Strive to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years. Our motherland is leaping from a victorious decade to an even greater victorious decade.

    向工业国飞奔
    全国工业交通展览会巡礼
    新华社记者　李峰
    全国工业交通展览会（1949—1959）开幕了。
    这个展览会是我国工业交通十年来所取得的伟大成就的缩影，是去年和今年大跃进的铁证。
    进入北京展览馆金光闪闪的拱门，首先使观众停步仰望的是将载入我国史册的两块图表——我国工业交通十年来高速度发展的图表。图表上的数字，不，那不是一般的数字，那是我国向工业国飞奔的史诗，它告诉人们，我国今年的钢比1949年增长了七十五倍，机床增长三十七倍，煤、石油、化肥、水泥等重工业产品，也都增长了十倍至几十倍。棉纱、糖、纸等轻工业产品也增长了四倍至八倍以上。全国的运输量增长了好几倍，铁路线和公路线，也以新增一万多公里和三十多万公里的高速度伸向了祖国的四面八方。图表上1958年和1959年的两行数字，是用夺目的红色写成的，就像这篇史诗中加上的着重点。它表明着一个重要的结论：大跃进为我国工业交通开创了史无前例的高速度发展的新纪元。我国第一个五年计划期间，工业发展速度平均每年是18％，这已经是罕见的高速度了。但是，我国工业在经过第一个五年计划的建设、基数大大增加的基础上，1958年却又增长了66％，今年又将比去年增长25.6％。这两年增长的速度都大大地超过了第一个五年计划期间平均每年的增长速度。在主要工业产品的产量方面，1958年我国的钢、铁和煤的增长数量，都超过了第一个五年计划期间五年增长的总和。在这样大跃进的基础上，今年钢、铁和煤增长的数量仍将超过或等于第一个五年计划期间增长的总和。由于两年的跃进，我国第二个五年计划工业方面主要指标将提前三年在今年完成，而且煤炭、冶金设备、水泥、动力机械、盐、纸等计划的指标，已经在去年和今年相继宣告完成。
    从拱门里向东转去，就进入了金属的世界——冶金工业馆。这里陈列着世界上已经发现的大部分金属。大厅的中央，巍然矗立着我国今年生产的巨大的合金钢锭的模型。它是我国钢铁工业今年继续大跃进的象征。它身高六点五米，粗大得惊人，如果把它的顶部切平，上面足可以坐下十个人来开会，这样大的钢锭，等于去年在这里展出的轰动一时的那个大钢锭的三倍，它体重一百二十吨。我国能够铸造这样大的钢锭，就为我国制造许多重型机械提供了必需的锻件。在这巨大钢锭的模型一边，有粗如碗口细如绣针的各种无缝钢管，有厚过两砖的钢板和薄如复写纸的钢带，有大至长江大桥小至钢窗上用的几百种型钢。在这些大得惊人薄得出奇的钢铁产品面前，人们不能不产生对大跃进的激情。因为它们大部分都是在去年和今年大跃进中诞生的。在大钢锭的后面，是一片晶莹发光的有色金属和合金钢。这是钢铁工业的精华。这里，有六米高一点五米宽、三十毫米厚的大铝锭，像是一扇银光闪闪的大门。它的一旁是加工成上百种断面的铝材，显示着我国制铝工业的巨大跃进。在这里，还可以看到最难炼的钛、锆、钒、钨、钼，可以看到作为原子工业重要原料和材料的钍、锂、铍等稀有的金属，也可以看到作半导体用的锗和硅。锗和硅的纯度已经达到了大约只有一万万分之一的杂质，而且已经把锗和硅制成了单晶结体（制成单晶结体才能作半导体用）。由于我们充分地利用了我国富有的硅、钒、钼、钛、钨、硼等矿产资源，我国已建立了自己的合金钢系统，已能冶炼几百种合金钢。
    展览馆的中央大厅里，展览的是机床和机械工业的其它产品。在展出的一系列的精密机床中，有帝国主义对我国“禁运”的大型座标搪床，有全部自动化的六轴机床、高精度滚齿机和带“预选”装置的六角床。这种带预选装置的机床身配十几把刀具，可以加工各种轴类部件。这种机床可以按着工人给它规定的工作程序和任务不停地工作。一个人可以用十几台这种机床来生产。这里展出的立车比去年展出的又大了很多，它可以加工三点四米直径的机件。由于它身躯太高，工人必须攀登它身边特设的钢梯才能上到它的操纵台上。在大厅的一角，有一台奇怪的机床，它工作起来看不到一般机床切削下来的铁屑，听不到齿轮磨床的沙沙声响，它没有刀具，但它却能把世界上最硬的合金钢加工成各种复杂机件的模具。它是用强大的电流通过铜质的电极“刀具”来加工的。这种机床工作起来，模具钢被加工的表面就立即被溶化得像气体似的而烟消云散。这种机床就是今年新制成的电脉冲成型穿孔机床。另一台作模具用的超声波机床也十分奇特，它不仅能加工任何金属，而且能加工大理石和玻璃等非金属。它的“刀具”是金刚砂粒，机床开动起来以后，那镍质的“换能板”以每秒钟抖动两万五千次的动作撞击着金刚砂，金刚砂就用同样的速度向被加工的模具进攻。由于“换能板”抖动得快得肉眼不可能看得出来，所以它工作起来却像安然不动，而只是唱着声音细微的唧唧小曲。这两种机床的诞生，是我国机床工业今年跃进中的花朵。它为我国机械工业中用机械代替手工作模具开创了新的途径。在大厅里还横卧着七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机的转子。我国将用这种大发电机来建设新安江等大电站。这里还横卧着代表我国制成的五万瓩的汽轮机和汽轮发电机的转子。解说员告诉我们，我国从1954年生产出六千瓩的汽轮发电机到今年生产出五万瓩的火力发电设备，中间只经过了四年，而英国却用了六十四年。大厅两边的侧厅里，是各种精密仪表和无线电工业产品。其中有十万倍的电子显微镜；有感量可达到百万分之一克的天秤，它对相当一寸头发丝的1％的重量都有灵敏的反应；有二百五十瓩的强功率发射管，这样一个电子管的功率比抗日战争前国民党中央广播电台全部发射管的功率还大三倍。在大厅两边的东西广场上展出的机械中，有形似蜻蜓的旋风—25型直升飞机。这种飞机在运输、农业、林业、渔业、救生等方面都有很大用处。它可以在广场、草地、船舰甲板甚至大厦的平顶上起落。如果它安装上雪撬或浮筒，还可以在雪地、冰和水上起落。展品中还有年处理三百二十万吨钢坯的轧钢机的轧辊和机架，有采用最新技术生产的红旗牌高级轿车，有各种拖拉机等等。这些产品表明，我国的冶金设备、汽车、拖拉机和飞机制造业具有了相当先进的技术水平。如果你留意观察，那些最大最精密的产品，也都是在去年和今年大跃进中诞生的。
    走进煤炭工业馆，镶在巨大煤块上的红色箭头使人们看了我国煤炭工业向前跃进的步伐是多么飞快：我国煤炭工业十年的发展，超过了旧中国七十年，相当于英国六十多年。在石油工业馆圆形的产品台上，二百多种石油产品琳琅满目。台前一个直线上升的红色箭头告诉人们，我国1959年石油产量（计划）比1949年增长了二十八倍。进入化工馆，立即使人产生了“人离不开化学”的感觉。这里有用于国家各种建设和家庭用品的美不胜赞的塑料，有在质量方面达到了国际水平的活性染料，有为农业服务的肥料和农药。展品的说明中写着，我国的化肥已由十年前的一种发展到了二十多种，产量（1958年）增加了三十倍。农药由十年前的十种增加到了一百五十七种，其中大批生产的有六十多种。化肥和农药产量的增长，促进了我国农业的大丰收。
    一向很吸引人的原子能馆里，展览着我国第一座实验性重水原子反应堆和加速器的模型。这座反应堆和回旋加速器，是1958年苏联帮助我国播下的和平利用原子能的种子，现在它已经开花结果。根据苏联帮助我国建成的这座回旋加速器，我国正在制造各种加速器。我国投入生产的原子反应堆，除去进行了重要的原子物理研究以外，还生产出了三十多种放射性同位素。这里展出的图片、模型和实物表明，我国已经把放射性同位素应用到了石油、地质、煤炭、冶金、机械、化学等工业部门和医学、农业科学研究等方面。北京、上海、天津等九个城市已经把同位素用于诊断、治疗和医学研究工作。植物科学研究机关也已经利用同位素研究帮助农作物生长和总结农业大丰收的经验，并且取得了可贵的成果。特别使人高兴的是这里展出的我国自制的各种类型的原子核乳胶。它是研究宇宙线和基本粒子的非常重要的工具。它的质量已经可以同资本主义世界乳胶质量最好的英国“依尔福”公司的出品相较量。
    在地质馆的中央，是一座象征我国“江山多娇、矿藏富饶”的布满各种矿石的假山。它说明旧中国五十多年才只勘探了十八种矿产，而新中国十年就探明了八十八种矿产。我国已经探明的钨、锡、钼、锑、铁、锰、铝、铅、铜、汞、煤等矿产，证明在世界上我国是这些矿产储量相当多的国家。参观完了地质馆，好像对我们祖国的大地作了一次透视。透视的结果是：我们完全拥有保证我国工业今后继续高速度发展的雄厚的后备资源。
    登上中央大厅的楼上，像是步入了百花争妍、奇葩竞美的大花园。这里用各种美丽的纺织品和轻工业品展现出了我国人民生活的美景。这里有在世界上享有盛名的绸、缎、绫、罗，有劳动人民喜爱的各种针织品和花布，有各种日用品、装饰品等等。这些产品的产量都比十年前有了成倍的增长。看到这里的各种用纸，很容易引起中年人对十年前自己用纸情况的回忆：那时由于美货倾销，我国造纸工业奄奄待毙，连卫生用纸上也贴着U·S·A的商标。今天，人们在这里可以看到我国自产的各种高级纸：有的可供记录心脏跳动和人造卫星运行的情形，有的可供探测海洋深度和海洋中的鱼群，有的能使你见到给你来电报的亲友的手笔，有的可以用来作四十万伏的高压电缆的绝缘外皮。
    步入铁道和交通馆，又像是进了通往祖国任何地方的交通站。三万多公里的铁路，四十万公里的公路网，贯通全国的航线，十五万多公里的内河航道，组成了我们祖国的大动脉。各个交通部门的货运量和客运量急剧增长的情况说明，交通事业的大发展，促进了我国工农业生产的大跃进，加强了工农联盟，促进全国的繁荣。在这里，打通秦岭修筑宝成路并把这条铁路建成我国第一条电气化铁路的艰巨工程，在世界的屋脊上修筑一万多公里公路的奇迹，也都通过模型和图片展现在人们面前。
    展览会上无数的事实表明，正是有党的正确领导，由于有党的总路线和一系列“两条腿”走路的正确方针，十年来我国才能够一直高速度地向工业国飞跃。就以国内外反动派和国内右倾机会主义分子认为“搞糟”了的群众大炼钢铁来说吧！冶金馆展出的实物和图表告诉人们，从去年大炼钢铁到今年年初，几个月的时间我国建立的小洋高炉的容积就有四万三千立方米。这些小高炉今年将生产一千万吨合乎炼钢和铸造用的生铁。我们几个月建设的小高炉（仅仅是小高炉啊！）所达到的这个生产水平，旧中国一百年都没有达到！美国在和我国相同的生产水平的基础上增长一千万吨铁，用了十几年，英国则用了八十多年。在建设上述小高炉的同一时期，我国建立的转炉容积共达一千四百吨。炼钢生产能力像这样高速度的增长，又有哪个资本主义国家所能相比？在机械、煤炭等所有馆里，生动的事实也都证明，党的正确领导，是我国工业交通高速度发展的根本原因。参观完展览会展出的我国十年工业交通事业的伟大成就，从展览馆的拱门漫步欲出时，拱门里一幅标语又向人们展现了我国工业今后十年的宏伟前景：为在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国而奋斗。我们的祖国，正在从胜利的十年，向更大胜利的十年跃进。
