Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch: Wei Gaohou, an outstanding technical innovation expert and young milling machine operator at the Chongqing Chang’an Machine Factory, completed the equivalent of four months and seven days of work in thirteen working days from August 29 to September 11. By this, he has fulfilled ahead of schedule the guarantee conditions for carrying out an emulation competition with Liao Shigang, a famous innovation expert in the city: to complete the work task for the last four months of this year in twenty days.

Wei Gaohou, thanks to vigorous technical innovation, completed the equivalent of more than one month's work from September 1 to 4. After that, he continued to advance at an astonishing speed. Focusing on the tasks of his lathe and the current production tasks of his group and section, he tried every means to find tricks and constantly put forward innovation suggestions. Therefore, the machine tool where Wei Gaohou was located completed the September production task according to work hours and varieties twenty-three days ahead of schedule by September 7.

His section and group planned to solve several major difficult problems in September. Two of the difficulties were that processing the Yuan car large gear rack and processing the Yuan car gearbox cover were too slow; if processed according to the original method, the large gear rack would not be completed until the 8th of next month, and there would be a shortage of two machine tools and six workers for processing this part; the gearbox cover had to go through five processes according to the old method, and the task for this month was large, and it could not be completed this month either. Wei Gaohou thought about it and thought that he had encountered similar situations in his previous innovation suggestions, and the problems he encountered now were just more complicated. He ran to ask the old worker Xiang Tiangui for advice, and studied whether the method of electric steel sawing could be used instead of milling for processing large gear racks. Master Xiang thought it was possible, but the existing sawing equipment did not meet the requirements. The two of them jointly studied and improved the chuck of the sawing machine. Another old worker surnamed Yuan also took out his precious electric saw and lent it to Wei Gaohou for use. In this way, each large gear rack weighing twelve kilograms only took two minutes to process, which increased efficiency twenty times compared with the original milling machine processing, and saved one process. With the help of everyone, Wei Gaohou completed the processing task accepted by his group in only twelve hours, and the quality of the work reached 100%. The key to processing the gearbox cover was also quickly broken through by Wei Gaohou with the help of the old workers. He changed to using precision casting instead of the original processing method that required five processes, and completed this production task in only three and a half hours, with the quality reaching 100%.

As of September 11, Wei Gaohou has realized thirty-two innovation suggestions, and has fulfilled the original plan to complete the work task for the last four months of this year in twenty days ahead of schedule in terms of variety, quantity, and quality. In addition, Wei Gaohou has also helped workers in other groups to realize seventeen innovation suggestions in these ten days, which greatly improved their production efficiency.

Wei Gaohou's newly proposed struggle goal is: by the end of September, he will put forward fifty more innovation suggestions and realize forty of them; and in this period, he will complete the equivalent of two months of work again. (Attached picture)

### 魏高厚提前实现对手赛保证条件  十三天完成四个月工作量

    魏高厚提前实现对手赛保证条件
    十三天完成四个月工作量
    据新华社重庆电　重庆市出色的技术革新能手、重庆长安机器厂青年铣工魏高厚，从8月29日到9月11日，以十三天工作时间完成了相当于四个月零七天的工作量。至此，他已提前实现了同本市著名革新能手廖世刚开展对手竞赛的保证条件：用二十天的时间完成今年最后四个月的工作任务。
    魏高厚由于大闹技术革新，在9月1日至4日，就完成了相当于一个月以上的工作量。之后，他又以惊人的速度继续前进。他围绕自己车床的任务和本小组、本工段当前的生产任务，千方百计寻找窍门，不断提出革新建议。因此，魏高厚所在的机床，到9月7日就提前二十三天按工时按品种完成了9月份生产任务。
    他所在的工段和小组，9月份计划解决几个主要的困难问题。其中的两个困难是，加工元车大齿条和加工元车牙箱盖速度太慢；如果按原有办法加工，大齿条要下个月8日才能完成，并且还缺少加工这种零件的机床两台，缺少六个工人；牙箱盖按老办法加工要经过五道工序，本月份的任务又大，本月也不能完成。魏高厚左思右想，想到自己过去在革新建议中曾遇到过类似情形，目前遇到的问题不过是更复杂一些。他跑去请教老工人向天贵，研究加工大齿条能否用电钢车锯的办法代替铣车铣。向师傅认为可以，只是现有锯车的设备不符合要求。两人便共同研究改进了锯车的夹头。另一个姓袁的老工人见到这种情形，也拿出自己视若珍宝的电锯，借给魏高厚使用。这样，每一件十二公斤重的大齿条，只需用两分钟便加工好一件，比起原来用铣车加工提高效率二十倍，并且节约了一道工序。魏高厚在大家的帮助下，只用十二个小时便加工完了本小组接受的这项加工任务，加工的活的质量达到100％。加工牙箱盖的关键，在老工人的帮助下，也被魏高厚很快突破了。他改用精密铸造的方法代替原来需经过五道工序的加工方法，只以三个半小时的时间就完成了这项生产任务，质量达到100％。
    到9月11日为止，魏高厚实现了三十二项革新建议，按品种、按数量、按质量，提前实现了原订用二十天时间完成今年后四个月工作任务的计划。此外，魏高厚在这十多天的时间之内，还帮助本小组别的工人实现了十七项革新建议，从而大大提高了他们的生产效率。
    魏高厚新提出的奋斗目标是：到9月月底，要再提五十项革新建议，实现四十项；并且在这段时间之内，再完成相当于两个月的工作量。（附图片）
