Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 21st. The Physical Testing Group of the Testing Laboratory of the Guizhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after heat treatment of high-sulfur white cast iron, produced nodular cast iron rails. After testing and evaluation, the compressive and tensile strength greatly exceeded gray cast iron castings, reaching the general nodular cast iron standard. This achievement can expand the use of some of the original high-sulfur, high-phosphorus native iron in Guizhou Province; it also provides conditions for the construction of lightweight railways for factories, mines, and people's communes.

High-sulfur native iron does not require metallic magnesium or magnesium alloys as spheroidizing agents. The spheroidizing effect is achieved through a short period of heat treatment annealing, which can transform hard and brittle white cast iron castings into nodular cast iron. After transforming high-sulfur white cast iron into nodular cast iron through heat treatment, they established a cooperative relationship with the Guiyang Railway Bureau Mechanical Repair Plant of the Ministry of Railways, and finally successfully trial-produced lightweight rails. The test results showed that the mechanical strength was 51.7 kilograms per square millimeter, and the hardness, elongation rate, and metallographic structure were also fully qualified. Currently, the Guiyang Railway Bureau Mechanical Repair Plant is actively preparing to produce this lightweight rail in large quantities.

The personnel of the Physical Testing Group received assistance from engineers and veteran technicians from the Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory and the Shuicheng Iron and Steel Plant in this experiment.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 21st. The Kunming Metallurgical Ceramic Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after repeated experiments, successfully trial-produced "High-Sulfur Annealed Nodular Cast Iron" using high-sulfur native iron.

Practice has proven that this high-sulfur annealed nodular cast iron has high tensile strength, good wear resistance, and mechanical properties, and can completely stand shoulder to shoulder with medium carbon steel.

A Model 41 gearbox recently manufactured by this research institute, with components such as worm gears, worms, main shafts, bushings, and thrust ball bearings, was made of this high-sulfur annealed nodular cast iron, whereas in the past, alloy steel, medium carbon steel, and tin bronze were used. This Model 41 gearbox rotates at 430 revolutions per minute without any noise. Under no-load operation for six hours, the bearing temperature was 36 degrees Celsius; under load operation on a lathe for two hours, the bearing temperature remained the same, proving that it fully meets the requirements of the mechanical industry.

The production of this high-sulfur annealed nodular cast iron is very simple, and general iron-smelting furnaces and crucibles can be used for production. In terms of technical operation, the main point is to add an appropriate amount of ferrosilicon and aluminum to the high-sulfur native iron produced by a large number of native blast furnaces in the past during smelting, and then perform short-term annealing treatment.

Kunming Automobile Transportation Main Station and many other units have officially used high-sulfur annealed nodular cast iron to mass-produce parts for automobiles, tractors, and internal combustion engines.

    谁说土铁没有用
    贵州将高硫白口铁加工成轻便铁轨
    昆明土铁制的球墨铸铁抵上中碳钢
    据新华社贵阳21日电　中国科学院贵州分院检验室物理检验组，用高硫白口铁经热处理后，制成球墨铸铁铁轨。经过检验鉴定，抗压抗拉强度大大超过灰口铁铸件，达到一般球墨铸铁标准。这项成就，可以使贵州省原有的部分高硫高磷土铁扩大用途；同时也为工厂矿山和人民公社建设轻便铁路提供条件。
    高硫土铁不需用金属镁或镁合金作球化剂，经过短时期热处理退火方法起球化作用，能使硬脆的白口铁铸件转变为球墨铸铁。把高硫白口铁经过热处理变成球墨铸铁后，他们即与铁道部贵阳铁路局机械修配厂建立协作关系，最后试制成功了轻便铁轨。检验结果：机械强度为一平方毫米五一点七公斤，硬度、延伸率及金相组织等也完全合格。现在，贵阳铁路局机械修配厂正在积极准备大量生产这种轻便铁轨。
    物理检验组人员在这项试验中，得到了贵阳矿山机器厂和水城钢铁厂的工程师和老技工的帮助。
    据新华社昆明21日电　中国科学院昆明冶金陶瓷研究所经过多次试验，利用高硫土铁试制成功了“高硫退火球墨铸铁”。
    实践证明，这种高硫退火球墨铸铁有很高的抗拉强度，良好的耐磨性和机械性能，完全可以同中碳钢平起平坐，并驾齐驱。
    这个研究所最近制造的一台四十一型变速箱，里面的蜗轮、蜗杆、主轴、轴瓦以及止推滚珠轴承等部件，就是用这种高硫退火球墨铸铁制造的，而在过去是用合金钢、中碳钢、锡青铜作的。这台四十一型变速箱每分钟转四百三十转，没有任何杂音，空载运转六小时，轴承温度为摄氏三十六度；放上车床有载运转二小时，轴承温度还是保持原样，证明完全合乎机械工业的要求。
    这种高硫退火球墨铸铁的生产很简便，一般的化铁炉、坩埚都能生产。在技术操作上，主要是把过去大批土高炉生产的高硫土铁，在熔炼中加入适量的硅铁和铝，然后进行短时间的退火处理。
    昆明汽车运输总站等许多单位已正式用高硫退火球墨铸铁成批生产汽车、拖拉机、内燃机上的部件。
