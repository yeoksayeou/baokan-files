Following the publication of Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on September 8th, the public can now fully understand the truth about the Sino-Indian border issue and the tense border situation. Recently, some regrettable incidents, unseen for a decade, have indeed occurred on the Sino-Indian border. Indian troops have repeatedly intruded into or occupied Chinese territory in several locations, some of which are still occupied by Indian troops. Particularly serious was the incident on August 25th when an Indian armed force intruded into the Langju area of the Majidun region, which is Chinese territory, provoked our border guards, and opened fire. Our border troops had no choice but to retaliate in self-defense. This was an armed conflict. We cannot help but feel extremely regretful about the repeated incidents of Indian intrusion into and occupation of our territory. To safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maintain the friendship between China and India, our government has repeatedly protested to India through diplomatic channels, demanding that India immediately cease such acts of aggression and withdraw from all illegally occupied Chinese territory. However, we have never received a satisfactory response from India. Despite this, China has always prioritized friendship and has not publicized these events extensively, demonstrating great restraint and patience, waiting for India to change its unfriendly attitude.

However, while China was adopting a restrained attitude and maintaining "silence," some individuals with ulterior motives in India were eager to exploit the Sino-Indian border incidents, stirring up trouble. Many Indian newspapers and some political figures who had stirred up an anti-China wave this spring using the Tibetan rebellion incident have once again taken the stage. In just three days, from August 29th to 31st, Delhi newspapers published nearly thirty commentaries attacking China. In front of our embassy in New Delhi and the consulates in Calcutta and Mumbai, rampant anti-China "demonstrations" took place. Some fabricated rumors that China had "invaded" India and "annexed Indian territory"; some slandered China as "Han chauvinist imperialism," "worse than Western imperialism"; some were even more sensational, claiming that this was an "international war fallen from the sky" and even suggested sending planes to bomb Chinese territory... In short, this group of individuals with ulterior motives is deliberately trying to create tension between China and India and destroy the friendship between the two countries.

We had hoped that the Indian government would come forward to clarify this chaotic situation and stop activities that are detrimental to Sino-Indian friendship and the common interests of both countries. However, so far, this expectation has not been met with a due response. Since August, Prime Minister Nehru has spoken more than ten times on issues related to Sino-Indian relations. He is right to believe that people should not be alarmed. However, when we read some of his remarks, we cannot help but be surprised. Prime Minister Nehru has repeatedly claimed that Chinese troops have "crossed" the Sino-Indian border and "invaded" Indian territory. In his speech to the Council of States on August 31st, he also arbitrarily stated that China had "intruded" into India's Northeast Frontier Agency and said that "this is a clear act of aggression." He even said that China also "threatened" Bhutan and that "some Bhutanese heard this threat." (On September 1st, Bhutanese Prime Minister Dorji stated that Bhutan had not been invaded by China.) If Prime Minister Nehru's remarks about Bhutan were perhaps inappropriate due to a lack of understanding, then this reason cannot be used to explain the Sino-Indian border issue. Prime Minister Nehru cannot be unaware of the actual situation on the Sino-Indian border, but some of his remarks are not consistent with the facts. We respect Mr. Nehru, but in any case, we cannot help but believe that Mr. Nehru's remarks are not helpful in clarifying the chaotic situation. In fact, these remarks, in addition to fueling activities that seek to create tension on the Sino-Indian border and thereby undermine Sino-Indian friendship, making the Sino-Indian border issue even more complex, are of no benefit to easing the situation on the Sino-Indian border and maintaining Sino-Indian friendship.

China and India have a border line of about two thousand kilometers, but it has never been formally demarcated. This is a complex issue left over from the British colonial rule in India pursuing a policy of aggression against China. The Chinese government's basic position on this issue has been clearly stated in Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Prime Minister Nehru on September 8th. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese government cannot, as requested by the Indian government, recognize the situation created by Britain's past policy of aggression against China's Tibet region as the basis for resolving the Sino-Indian border issue. The Chinese government cannot but express great regret that the Indian government is exerting various pressures, even resorting to force, to support this demand. Premier Zhou Enlai said, "The Chinese government has consistently maintained that China and India should consider the historical background and the current actual situation, and comprehensively resolve the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultations in a prepared and step-by-step manner in accordance with the Five Principles. Prior to this, as a temporary measure, both sides should maintain the long-standing state of the border, and should not change this state with unilateral actions, let alone with the use of force; for some disputes, partial and temporary agreements can also be reached through negotiations to ensure peace and tranquility on the border and maintain the friendship between the two countries." In short, the Chinese government's attitude is: (1) willing to comprehensively resolve the Sino-Indian border issue through friendly consultations; (2) prior to a comprehensive resolution, both sides maintain the long-standing state of the border; (3) for existing local disputes, temporary solutions can be discussed. This is a reasonable attitude. We see no reason why India should oppose this attitude, which is in the common interests of China and India. However, it is particularly regrettable that after Premier Zhou Enlai reiterated the Chinese government's consistent position in his letter to Prime Minister Nehru on September 8th, Prime Minister Nehru still made accusations against the Chinese government in the Indian Council of States on September 10th, which can only please the enemies of Sino-Indian friendship and sadden all those who care about Sino-Indian friendship.

From the existing situation, it seems that India holds a different position on the Sino-Indian border issue. This is particularly evident in the so-called McMahon Line issue. Prime Minister Nehru believes that the so-called McMahon Line is the Sino-Indian border east of Bhutan, which is "fixed and unchangeable according to treaty provisions, fixed and unchangeable according to custom and rights, and also fixed and unchangeable geographically." He also said that the border drawn by McMahon has "full authority." However, the whole world knows that the Indian government has never denied that the so-called McMahon Line has never been recognized by the Chinese government. In fact, the so-called McMahon Line is a product of British imperialism's past policy of aggression against China's Tibet region. It was decided by the British representative McMahon and the representative of the Tibetan local authorities outside the Simla Conference of 1913-1914, through a secret exchange of letters behind the back of the Chinese central government, and is therefore illegal. Moreover, even in the annex map of the Simla Treaty signed by the British and Tibetan local authorities, this line only shows the boundary between inland China and Tibet and does not mention it as the boundary between China and India. The Sino-Indian border issue was not discussed at the Simla Conference. The representative of the Chinese central government who participated in the Simla Conference did not sign the map. The Chinese central government at the time did not sign and approve the Simla Treaty. None of the subsequent Chinese central governments, whether the Northern Warlord government or the later Kuomintang government, recognized the Simla Treaty. As for the secret exchange of letters between the British and Tibetan local authorities regarding the McMahon Line, it has never been recognized by the Chinese government. Even the Tibetan local authorities later expressed dissatisfaction with the McMahon Line. After India's independence, the Tibetan local government once requested India to return all the territory of China's Tibet region south of this illegal boundary line, and the Indian government also expressed in its reply its hope to reach a "new agreement acceptable to both parties." It can be seen that this so-called McMahon Line was entirely unilaterally decided by Britain in the past, attempting to impose it on China. This is the "right" and "authority" of imperialist aggression, is this not obvious enough? Secondly, if we talk about custom, then the large area that has been划入 [劃入 – incorporated] into the Indian territory according to the McMahon Line has long belonged to our territory, not Indian territory. The Chinese side has always resolutely refused to recognize this illegal occupation. Again, the so-called principle of determining which country a place should belong to based on geographical features is particularly strange. Prime Minister Nehru said that the McMahon Line "happened to have an advantage" because it is a "clear watershed." True, there is a watershed there, but it is a watershed on Chinese territory, not in India, nor is it shared by China and India. Just because there is a watershed there, can it occupy 90,000 square kilometers of Chinese territory and say that the watershed is the Sino-Indian border? Is there any more untenable argument in the world than this?

In fact, the so-called authority, custom, rights, geographical advantages, and other reasons of the McMahon Line are untenable. But here there occurred a so-called "map issue." In Indian newspapers and parliament, some people insisted that Chinese maps are "wrong." But whose maps incorporate other people's territory into their own? Not China's; Chinese maps have always been drawn according to the traditional Sino-Indian border. Since the Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated, since it has not been reasonably resolved through negotiations, let alone surveyed and determined, then how can it be arbitrarily modified on the map? If it is to be modified, then according to what should it be modified? For this reason, China has not modified the maps that were popular before liberation, nor has it asked India to modify the maps they published. What right does India have to ask China to modify its current maps according to the maps published by India? It should be reminded to those who are particularly interested in the map issue that before 1930, even the maps in the Encyclopedia Britannica were drawn according to the traditional Sino-Indian border and did not mark the McMahon Line. Even more than ten years after the British imperialists signed the secret exchange of letters regarding the McMahon Line, they still dared not openly draw this line on the map. In addition, the Indian army only advanced on a large scale into the area south of the so-called McMahon Line around 1951, before and after the peaceful liberation of China's Tibet region. All this shows that the statement that the so-called McMahon Line "has full authority" is also not in accordance with the facts.

We list these facts in general, rather than exhaustively, for no other purpose than to illustrate that the Sino-Indian border issue has a complex historical background, and its resolution requires both sides to consider the historical and realistic situation and conduct consultations with a reasonable, conciliatory, and friendly attitude. Mr. Nehru seemed to oppose talking about history in his speech on September 10th, but this is not some ancient history, but the events of recent decades, the realistic outstanding issues created by modern aggressors that urgently require China and India to legally resolve. We are willing to resolve outstanding issues through peaceful consultations, but denying the existence of outstanding issues is tantamount to denying the need for consultation. It is precisely because of Britain's past aggression against China's Tibet region, it is precisely because the Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated, it is precisely because the McMahon Line is illegal, it is precisely because India is independent, China and India have become friendly neighbors coexisting peacefully, China highly respects India's friendship, and must and does treat India with an attitude of treating a great and friendly neighbor rather than treating a British aggressor, it is precisely because of all these factors that the Sino-Indian border has become a complex issue. The Chinese government's basic position is to consider both the historical background and adopt a realistic attitude. What is unreasonable about this? Moreover, although China does not recognize the McMahon Line, we have never taken any unilateral action to change the long-standing state of the Sino-Indian border, but instead advocate that both sides temporarily maintain this state before the formal Sino-Indian border line is demarcated. This principle was originally agreed to by the Indian government. Unfortunately, the Indian side has not treated China's position seriously, objectively, and fairly, and has not abided by this principle. Our border defense troops in Tibet have always strictly abided by the government's instructions, not only have they never entered Indian territory, but they have never crossed the so-called McMahon Line. However, the Indian side has repeatedly intruded into our territory, even intruding north of the McMahon Line, which they consider "fixed and unchangeable," and even intruding north of the border line on the Indian-published maps, which is more deeply into our territory than the McMahon Line in many places (for example, Langju in our Majidun region). The Chinese people never invade others, but we also resolutely oppose anyone invading us; the Chinese people never occupy an inch of anyone's land, but we also resolutely oppose anyone occupying our territory. This Indian attempt to change the long-standing status quo of the Sino-Indian border with force, as well as public opinion and diplomatic pressure, gives us reason to suspect whether India wants to impose the so-called McMahon Line and other unreasonable borders on China. If so, then they are completely wrong! How can it be conceived that the people's government of New China can be forced to accept this illegal, unilaterally decided boundary line? Is this kind of thinking and practice beneficial to the friendship between China and India, and to the credibility of the Indian government, one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence?

We believe that no matter how far apart the views of China and India are on the border issue, incidents like the current intrusion and occupation of Chinese territory by Indian troops should not occur. Why has a border that has maintained a state of peace for ten years suddenly experienced a series of incidents now? Is this not worthy of deep consideration by all Indian patriots? Prime Minister Nehru said that the Sino-Indian border incidents are "minor matters." Indeed, from the Chinese side, we have always hoped not to expand the situation, but to turn "minor matters" into nothing through consultations between the two sides. However, we cannot but notice that there are some people in India who are stirring up trouble and are determined to expand the situation. They not only want to destroy the friendly relations between China and India, but also have more sinister and ulterior motives. The right-wing politicians in India who advocate allying with imperialist aggressive forces and opposing domestic and foreign democratic and progressive forces are currently trying their best to undermine the authorities' policy of peace and neutrality, and are conspiring to squeeze out those who adhere to this foreign policy that is in line with the interests of the Indian nation, in order to lead India onto the road of joining military blocs. This is already an open secret. At the same time, Western imperialism is also taking the opportunity to sow discord and fish in troubled waters. They make no secret of their appreciation for the anti-China movement stirred up by some people in India. They believe that the current practices of some people in India are something they cannot do for them and have been seeking for a long time. They purposefully asserted that "Nehru has finally suffered the retribution of his neutralist attitude." The American "World Telegram and the Sun" said it very bluntly: "If India can be made to realize this fact in modern political life (abandoning its neutrality), it may be beneficial to the entire free world." Enlightened people in India understand that the current policy of peace and neutrality of the Indian authorities is in line with the interests of the Indian state and people. Until recently, Prime Minister Nehru also announced that the Five Principles are still the criteria for India's foreign policy. However, the current unpleasant incidents between China and India have created an opportunity for imperialism and its agents in India, which cannot but arouse great vigilance from the Indian government and people. The resolution of the mass rally of "India-China Friendship Day" held in Calcutta on May 28th once pointed out: "Any effort to create tension between India and China will only benefit imperialism." This truth is never more obvious than it is now. China and India have both suffered long-term oppression and rule by imperialism in the past, and now they have both achieved independence and jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China has always pursued a friendly policy towards India, and has always hoped that the border between China and India will always be peaceful and tranquil, making it a truly peaceful and friendly border. We are willing to tell all our Indian friends once again that China and India are not only not enemies, but will not be enemies. China has never threatened, will never threaten, invade, or interfere in India, those who threaten, invade, and interfere in India are precisely those who are trying to fish in troubled waters in the Sino-Indian border incidents, those who are trying to change India's foreign policy and undermine peace in Asia, and they are the common enemies of the people of China and India. It is quite clear that China is unwilling to let these people achieve their goals. Now that some unpleasant things have happened on the Sino-Indian border, the responsibility definitely does not lie with China. If some people on the Indian side did not have ulterior motives regarding these incidents, they would not have developed to the current point. Of course, it is not too late to resolve these issues now.

Prime Minister Nehru has expressed that the Sino-Indian border incidents should be resolved through peaceful negotiations, and that "the idea of solving problems by coercion and force is completely wrong." He also said: "In the long run, it is very important for these two great countries to be friends, regardless of their internal structure and policies." He reiterated that India wants to "work for friendship with China." These words of Prime Minister Nehru undoubtedly reflect the common aspirations of the broad masses of the Indian people, and are also valued and welcomed by the Chinese people.

Regarding the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border currently created by the Indian side, as well as resolving the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultation, Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru on September 8th has put forward reasonable solutions. We believe that with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, coupled with the desire for mutual friendship, any dispute between China and India can certainly be reasonably resolved. In the final analysis, those who are taking the opportunity to stir up a new anti-China movement are bound to fail. We deeply hope that the ship of Sino-Indian friendship will once again withstand the test of storms and waves, and continue to move forward on the ocean of peace along a firm and unwavering course.

    中印边界问题的真相
    我国周恩来总理在9月8日写给印度尼赫鲁总理的信发表以后，人们已经可以完全了解中印边界问题和边境紧张局势的真相了。最近一个时期，在中印边境上，的确发生了一些十年来所没有发生过的令人遗憾的事件，那就是印度军队曾经在几个地方一再侵入或侵占了中国领土，其中有几个地区直到现在还被印度军队占领着。特别严重的是，在8月25日一支印度武装部队侵入属于我国领土的马及墩地区的朗久地区，向我边防军进行挑衅并且开火。我边防部队为了自卫，不得不予以还击。这是一次武装冲突事件。印度一再侵犯和侵占我国领土的事件，不能不使我们感到极大的遗憾。为了维护我国的领土主权，为了维护中印两国的友谊，我国政府曾经一再通过外交途径向印度方面提出抗议，要求印度方面立即制止这种侵犯的行动，并退出一切非法侵占的我国领土。但是，我们始终没有得到印度方面的令人满意的回答。尽管这样，中国还是以友谊为重，不曾就这些事件大肆宣传，表现了极大的克制和忍耐，等待印度方面改变它的不友好的态度。
    但是，正当我国采取克制态度和保持“沉默”的时候，在印度却有一些别有用心的人，迫不及待地利用中印边境事件，大吵大闹起来。那些曾经在今年春天利用中国西藏叛乱事件掀起反华浪潮的许多印度报纸和一部分政界人物，又一次登场了。仅仅8月29日到31日三天，德里的报纸就发表了近三十篇攻击中国的评论。在我国驻新德里的大使馆以及在加尔各答、孟买的领事馆门前，发生了嚣张的反华“示威”。有人造谣说，中国“侵犯”了印度，“吞并了印度领土”；有人诽谤中国是“汉族帝国主义”，“比西方帝国主义更糟”；有人更加耸人听闻，说什么这是一场“从天而降的国际战争”，甚至建议派飞机去轰炸中国领土……。总之，这一群别有用心的人们存心要在中印两国之间制造紧张局势，存心要破坏中印两国的友谊。
    我们曾经期待印度政府能够出来澄清这种混乱的局势，制止这种不利于中印友好和两国共同利益的活动。但是，直到目前为止，这种期待还没有得到应有的反响。8月以来，尼赫鲁总理曾经就有关中印关系的问题讲过十几次话。他认为大家不该大惊小怪，这是正确的。但是当我们读到他的某些言论时，却不能不感到十分惊异。尼赫鲁总理一再声称，中国军队“越过”了中印边境，“侵犯”了印度领土。8月31日他在联邦院的讲话中还武断地说中国“侵入”了印度的东北边境特区，并且说“这是一个明白的侵略事件”。他甚至还说，中国也“威胁”了不丹，“有些不丹人听到了这种威胁”。（9月1日，不丹首相多尔吉已经声明，不丹并没有受到中国的侵入。）如果说，尼赫鲁总理在谈到不丹的时候，也许是由于不了解情况而讲了不适当的话，那么对于中印边境问题，就不能用这种理由来解释了。尼赫鲁总理不可能不了解中印边境的实际情况，但是他的某些言论却是不符合事实的。我们尊敬尼赫鲁先生，但是，无论如何，对于尼赫鲁先生的这些言论，我们不能不认为是无助于混乱局势的澄清。实际上，这些言论除了助长那些想要在中印边境制造紧张局势进而破坏中印友谊的活动，使中印两国边境问题变得更加复杂起来以外，对于缓和中印边境的形势和维护中印友谊，是没有任何益处的。
    中印两国有约二千公里长的边界线，但是从来没有正式划定过。这是英国统治印度时期对中国实行侵略政策而遗留下来的一个复杂的问题。中国政府对于这个问题的基本立场，在周恩来总理9月8日给尼赫鲁总理的复信中已经作了明确的申述。周恩来总理说，中国政府不能像印度政府所要求的那样，承认过去英国对中国西藏地方实行侵略政策所造成的局面，作为解决中印边界问题的根据。印度政府施加种种压力，甚至不惜使用武力来支持这种要求，中国政府更不能不表示极大的遗憾。周恩来总理说，“中国政府一贯主张，中印双方应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，有准备有步骤地通过友好协商，全面解决两国边界问题。在此以前，作为临时性的措施，双方应该维持边界久已存在的状况，而不以片面行动、更不应该使用武力改变这种状况；对于一部分争执，还可以通过谈判达成局部性和临时性的协议，以保证边境的安宁，维护两国的友谊。”简而言之，中国政府的态度是：（1）愿意通过友好协商，全面解决中印边界问题；（2）在全面解决之前，双方维持边界的久已存在的状况；（3）对于已发生的局部争执，可以商谈临时性的解决办法。这是合情合理的态度。我们看不出，印度方面有什么理由反对这种符合于中印两国共同利益的态度。但是，令人特别惋惜的是，在周恩来总理在9月8日给尼赫鲁总理的信中重申了中国政府的一贯的立场之后，尼赫鲁总理在9月10日的印度联邦院中，仍然对中国政府进行只能使中印友谊之敌称快而使一切关心中印友谊的人感到痛心的指责。
    从已有的情况看来，印度方面对于中印边界问题抱有不同的立场。这特别表现在对于所谓麦克马洪线的问题上。尼赫鲁总理认为，所谓麦克马洪线是不丹以东的中印边界，“根据条约规定是确定不移的，根据惯例和权利也是确定不移的，而从地理上来说，也是确定不移的”。他又说，根据麦克马洪所划的边界，具有“充分权威性”。然而，全世界都知道，印度政府是没有否认过，所谓麦克马洪线从未得到中国政府的承认。事实上，所谓麦克马洪线是英帝国主义过去对中国西藏地方实行侵略政策的产物，是在1913—1914年的西姆拉会议之外，由英国代表麦克马洪和西藏地方当局的代表，背着中国中央政府以秘密换文的方式决定的，因此是非法的。而且，即便是在英国和西藏地方当局代表所签订的西姆拉条约的附图中，这条线也只是表明中国内地和西藏之间的界线，根本没有说明过作为中国同印度的边界。西姆拉会议上没有讨论过中印边界问题。参加西姆拉会议的中国中央政府的代表并没有在地图上签字。当时的中国中央政府也没有签订和批准西姆拉条约。以后的中国的任何一个中央政府无论是北洋军阀政府，还是后来的国民党政府，都没有承认西姆拉条约。至于英国和西藏地方当局双方关于麦克马洪线的秘密换文，更是从来没有得到中国政府的承认。就是西藏地方当局，后来也对麦克马洪线表示不满。在印度独立以后，西藏地方政府曾经要求印度归还这条非法界线以南的中国西藏地方的全部领土，而印度政府也在答复中表示希望达成“双方均愿接受的新协定”。可见，这条所谓麦克马洪线，完全是英国过去片面决定，企图强加于中国的。这是帝国主义侵略的“权利”和“权威”，这难道不是再明显也不过的么？其次，如果谈到惯例，那么，根据麦克马洪线而划入印度版图的那一大片地区，长期以来就是属于我国的领土，而不是印度的领土。中国方面从来就坚决不承认这种非法的占领的。再次，所谓根据地理特征来确定什么地方应该属于哪个国家，这尤其是非常奇怪的原则。尼赫鲁总理说，麦克马洪线“适巧有一个优点”，因为它是一道“明显的分水岭”。不错，那儿有一道分水岭，然而它是在中国领土上的分水岭，而不在印度，也不是中印共有的。只是因为那儿有一道分水岭，就可以侵占中国九万平方公里的领土，把那个分水岭说成是中印国界，世界上难道有比这更站不住脚的论据吗？
    实际上，所谓麦克马洪线的权威、惯例、权利、地理优点等等理由都是不能成立的。但这里却发生了所谓“地图问题”。在印度的报纸上和议会里，有人硬说中国的地图是“错误”的。但是，究竟是谁的地图把别人的领土划进自己的版图呢？不是中国；中国的地图一直是按照传统的中印边界画的。因为中印边界既然从来没有正式划定过，既然一直又没有经过谈判取得合理的解决，更没有经过勘察确定，那么又怎能在地图上随便加以修改？如果要修改的话，那又根据什么来修改呢？正因为这个缘故，中国没有修改解放前就已流行的地图，也没有要求印度方面修改他们出版的地图。印度方面又有什么权利要求中国按照印度出版的地图修改现行的地图呢？应该提醒那些对地图问题特别有兴趣的人们，在1930年以前，甚至英国大百科全书的地图，也是按照传统的中印边界画的，而没有标出麦克马洪线。英帝国主义签订关于麦克马洪线的秘密换文十多年之后，都还不敢公然把这条线画在地图上。此外，印度军队也只是在1951年中国西藏地方和平解放前后，才大规模地向所谓麦克马洪线以南的地区推进。这一切说明，所谓麦克马洪线“具有充分权威性”的说法，也是不符合于事实的。
    我们概括地、而不是详尽地列举这些事实，目的无非是要说明中印边界问题有着复杂的历史背景，它的解决有待于双方考虑到历史的和现实的情况，采取合理的、和解的、友好的态度进行协商。尼赫鲁先生在9月10日的讲话中似乎反对谈历史，可是，这并不是什么远古的历史，而是近几十年的事，而是现代侵略者造成的、迫切要求中印两国加以合法解决的现实的悬案。我们是愿意通过和平协商解决悬案的，但是否认悬案的存在却无异于否认协商的必要。正是由于过去英国对中国西藏地方的侵略，正是由于中印边界从来没有正式划定过，正是由于麦克马洪线是非法的，正是由于印度独立了，中国和印度成了和平共处的友好邻邦，中国十分尊重印度的友谊，必须而且确实以对待伟大的友好邻邦而不是以对待英国侵略者的态度对待印度，正是由于这一切的因素，中印边界才成为一个复杂的问题。中国政府的基本立场是既考虑历史的背景，又采取现实的态度，这有什么不合理的呢？而且，尽管中国不承认麦克马洪线，我们却从来没有采取任何片面行动去改变中印边界久已存在的状况，而是主张在中印正式边界线没有划定以前，双方暂时保持这种状况。这个原则本来也是印度政府所同意了的。可惜的是印度方面并没有认真地、客观地、公平地对待中国的立场，并没有遵守这个原则。我国在西藏的边防部队始终严格遵守政府的指示，不但从来没有进入过印度领土，而且也从来没有越过所谓麦克马洪线一步。但是印度方面却一再侵入我国境内，甚至侵入他们所认为“确定不移”的麦克马洪线以北，甚至侵入印度目前出版的地图上的比麦克马洪线在许多地方更深入我国领土的边界线以北（例如我国马及墩地区的朗久）。中国人民从来不侵犯别人，但是我们也坚决反对任何人侵犯我们；中国人民从来不侵占任何人的一寸土地，但是我们也坚决反对任何人侵占我国的领土。印度方面这种想用武力以及舆论和外交的压力来改变中印边界久已存在的现状的做法，使我们有理由怀疑，印度是否想把所谓麦克马洪线以及其他不合理边界强加于中国。如果是这样，那么他们是完全想错了！试问，怎么可以设想，新中国的人民政府能够被强迫接受这个非法的、片面决定的边界线呢？这种想法和作法，对于中印两国的友好，对于和平共处五项原则的首倡者之一的印度政府的信誉，难道是有利的吗？
    我们认为，不管中印双方对边界问题的看法有多大距离，无论如何也不该发生目前这样的印度军队侵入和侵占中国领土的事件。为什么十年来一直维持和平状态的边界，现在却忽然发生一系列的事件呢？这难道不值得全印度的爱国人士深长思之么？尼赫鲁总理说，中印边境事件是“小事”。的确，从中国方面来说，我们一直不希望把事态扩大，而希望通过双方的协商，使“小事”化为无事。可是，我们不能不注意到，在印度有一些人正在兴风作浪，执意要把事态扩大，他们不但想破坏中印两国的友好关系，而且还有更阴险的不可告人的目的。印度的主张同帝国主义侵略势力结盟而反对国内外民主进步势力的右翼政客们，目前正在竭力破坏当局的和平中立政策，并且阴谋排挤坚持这个符合于印度民族利益的外交政策的人，以便把印度引到参加军事集团的道路上去。这已经是公开的秘密。同时，西方帝国主义也正在乘机挑拨离间，混水摸鱼。他们毫不隐讳他们对于印度一些人所煽起的反华运动的欣赏。他们认为印度有些人目前的这种作法是他们无法代庖而又是许久以来求之不得的。他们别有用心地断言“尼赫鲁终于遭到了中立主义态度的报应”。美国的“世界电讯与太阳报”说得很直率：“如果使得印度认识现代政治生活中的这个事实（放弃它的中立），那对整个自由世界可能是有好处的。”印度的有识之士都明白，印度当局现行的和平中立政策，是符合印度国家和人民的利益的。直到最近，尼赫鲁总理也宣布五项原则仍然是印度外交政策的准则。但是，目前中印之间的不愉快事件已经给帝国主义及其在印度的代理人造成可乘之机，这就不能不引起印度政府和人民的极大警惕。5月28日在加尔各答举行的“印中友好日”群众大会的决议曾经指出：“任何制造印度和中国之间的紧张局势的努力，只会有利于帝国主义。”这个真理再没有比现在更明显的了。中印两国过去都受过帝国主义的长期压迫和统治，现在都已取得独立，并且共同倡议了和平共处的五项原则。中国一向对印度实行友好政策，并一向希望中印两国的边界永远安宁无事，使它成为一个真正和平友好的边界。我们愿意再一次告诉一切印度朋友们，中印两国不但不是敌人，也不会是敌人。中国从来没有，将来也永远不会威胁印度、侵犯印度、干涉印度，威胁印度、侵犯印度、干涉印度的人正是那些力图在中印边境事件中混水摸鱼、力图改变印度外交政策和破坏亚洲和平的人，正是中印两国人民的共同敌人。十分明显，中国是不愿意让这些人达到目的的。现在在中印边境发生一些不愉快的事情，责任决不在中国。对于这些事件，如果印度方面不是有些人别有用心，那么根本就不会闹到现在这种地步。当然，现在来解决这些问题，也还不算晚。
    尼赫鲁总理曾经表示，中印边境事件应该通过和平谈判方式来解决，“用胁迫和武力来解决问题的想法是完全错误的”。他并且说：“从长远看来，这两个大国成为朋友是非常重要的，不论它们内部的结构和政策如何。”他重申，印度要“为同中国友好而努力”。尼赫鲁总理的这些话，无疑地反映了广大印度人民的共同愿望，也是中国人民所重视和欢迎的。
    对于目前由印度方面所造成的中印边界的紧张局势，以及经过友好协商来解决中印两国边境问题，周恩来总理9月8日给尼赫鲁总理的信，已经提出了合理的解决途径。我们相信，有了和平共处五项原则，再加上互相友好的愿望，那么中印之间的任何争端一定都可以求得合理解决。归根结底，那些别有用心的乘机掀起新的反华运动的人们肯定是要失败的。我们深切地希望，中印友谊的大船将再一次经过惊涛骇浪的考验，沿着坚定不移的航线，在和平的海洋上继续前进。
