Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 7th (Reporter Lu Xiaoping) – Henan Province, which did not have a single decent steel plant at this time last year, has now become one of the key iron-producing provinces in the country. From January to August, the province has already produced over 391,200 tons of iron and over 15,400 tons of steel. The province's steel army is enthusiastically responding to the Party's call, determined to increase the country's production of iron by 100,000 tons and steel by 6,500 tons this year.

    All of the steel produced in Henan Province this year has been smelted in converters and electric furnaces. Pig iron produced by small blast furnaces currently accounts for about 80% of the province's total pig iron production. This signifies that Henan's steel industry has transitioned from a production stage primarily based on small-scale, indigenous methods to one primarily based on small-scale, foreign methods.

    Since last winter and this spring, after a series of rational layouts and location work, Henan Province now has twenty-five steel plants with small-scale, foreign production methods, and thirty-seven iron smelting plants combining indigenous and foreign methods; one hundred and seventy-four small blast furnaces with a volume of eight cubic meters or more, forty-three converters and electric furnaces with a capacity of one ton or more, and eleven rolling mills have been built. In addition, two hundred and twenty-five No. 2 simple coking ovens have been built and basically completed. This has made most steel plants into joint enterprises for mining, coking, and smelting, laying a preliminary foundation for Henan's modern steel industry.

    During the great steel campaign last year, millions of people in Henan Province went to the mountains to mine ore, extract coal, and smelt iron. Last year, the province's coal production more than doubled, and a large number of iron ore resources were found in forty-eight counties and cities, reporting a total of 11,000 various mineral sites. Various locations built more than thirty refractory material factories, forming a refractory material network throughout the province. The broad masses, relying on their own efforts, smelted a large amount of indigenous steel and iron in a short period of time, which not only promoted the development of the province's county and commune machinery industry but also cultivated tens of thousands of technical workers from practice, paving the way for the development of a steel industry mainly based on small-scale foreign methods.

    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at this time last year, mobilized the masses to mainly use small-scale indigenous methods, and on the basis of small-scale indigenous methods, combined indigenous and foreign methods, from indigenous to foreign, and combined large, medium, and small sizes to run the steel industry, based on the actual situation in Henan Province. Before the great steel campaign last year, the province only produced about 3,000 tons of indigenous iron annually, and not even a single ton of steel. Other refractory material and coking production related to the steel industry were also almost blank. Although the province has abundant coal resources, the output was also relatively small. Under these circumstances, there were no conditions at that time to run large modern steel enterprises, and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production urgently required steel. Therefore, as soon as the Party put forward the requirement to first start the great steel campaign with indigenous methods, it quickly received an enthusiastic response from the broad masses. Only by first starting with indigenous methods can we quickly achieve results and create conditions as soon as possible to build medium and small steel enterprises with foreign production methods. Now, Henan Province's steel industry has developed into a production stage mainly based on small-scale foreign methods, which has realized the desire of the broad masses to run a great steel campaign at that time.

    The small and medium-sized blast furnaces that have now been built in Henan Province are all close to the origin of raw materials and fuels, and the supply of raw materials and fuels is very convenient, so the output of pig iron is rising day by day. At the same time, with the improvement of workers' technical level and the continuous improvement of enterprise management, various technical and economic indicators are also constantly improving. Comparing the situation in mid-August with the first quarter of this year, labor productivity has increased by 82%, the utilization coefficient has increased by 60%, the coke ratio has decreased by 38%, the cost has decreased by nearly half, and the qualified rate of pig iron has increased from 30% in the first quarter to 83%. The pig iron produced this year is not only transferred to large steel plants in other places for steelmaking but is also used for casting in the machinery industry.

    两条腿走路健步如飞  大中小结合威力无穷
    河南由土到洋抹去空白点办起六十多座钢铁厂
    新华社郑州7日电　记者陆笑萍报道：去年这个时候还没有一个像样子钢铁厂的河南省，今年一跃而为全国产铁的重点省份之一。从1月到8月，这个省已经产铁三十九万一千二百多吨，产钢一万五千四百多吨。全省钢铁大军热烈响应党的号召，决心在今年内为国家增产生铁十万吨，钢六千五百吨。
    今年河南省产的钢，全部是由转炉和电炉炼出来的。小高炉生产的生铁，目前占全省生铁总产量的80％左右。这标志着河南省的钢铁工业，已经由小型、土法为主的生产阶段，进入了以小型、洋法为主的生产阶段。
    从去冬今春以来经过一系列的合理布局定点工作，目前河南省已经有小型、洋法生产的钢铁厂二十五个，土洋结合的炼铁厂三十七个；已经建成的八立方米以上的小高炉一百七十四座，一吨以上的转炉和电炉四十三座，轧钢机十一台。此外，还建成和基本建成了二号简易炼焦炉二百二十五座。这样，就使大多数钢铁厂成为采矿、炼焦、冶炼等的联合企业，初步地奠定了河南现代化钢铁工业的基础。
    在去年大办钢铁的时候，河南全省曾有几百万人上山挖矿、采煤、炼铁。去年全省煤炭产量增加了两倍多，在四十八个县、市找到了大量的铁矿资源，共报各种矿点一万一千个。各地新建了三十多座耐火材料厂，在全省形成了耐火材料网。广大群众就是这样自力更生地在很短的时间里，炼出了大量的土钢、土铁，不仅促进了本省县社机械工业的发展，而且从实践中培养出了十几万技术工人，为发展小型洋法为主的钢铁工业开辟了道路。
    中共河南省委在去年这个时候，发动群众以小型土法为主，并且在小型土法的基础上，土洋结合，由土到洋，大中小相结合地举办钢铁工业，是从河南省的实际情况出发的。在去年大办钢铁以前，全省每年只产土铁三千吨左右，钢连一吨也没有。其它同钢铁工业有关的耐火材料和炼焦生产，也几乎是空白。全省虽然煤炭资源很丰富，但是产量也较少。在这种情况下，当时没有条件举办大的现代化的钢铁企业，而工农业生产的大跃进，又对钢铁的需要很迫切。所以，党一提出用土法先上马大办钢铁的要求，很快就得到了广大群众的热烈响应。只有土法先上马，才能迅速收到效果，并且能尽快地创造出条件来建设洋法生产的中小型钢铁企业。现在，河南省钢铁工业发展为以小型、洋法为主的生产阶段，正是实现了当时广大群众大办钢铁的愿望。
    河南省现在已经建成的中小高炉，都接近原料、燃料产地，原料、燃料的供应都很方便，因此生铁的产量日日上升。同时，随着工人技术水平的提高和企业管理的不断改善，各项技术经济指标也在不断进步。以8月中旬的情况和今年第一季度比较，劳动生产率提高82％，利用系数提高60％，焦比降低38％，成本降低将近一半，生铁合格率已由第一季度的30％提高到83％。今年生产的生铁，不仅调给外地大钢厂炼钢，还供机械工业铸造之用。
