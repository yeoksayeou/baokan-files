    Beijing Film Studio is actively preparing to greet the tenth anniversary of National Day with the newest and best films. The color feature film "The Storm," "Song of Youth," and the wide and narrow screen feature film "Ten Thousand Waters, Thousand Mountains," co-produced by this studio and the "August First" Film Studio, have been basically completed and will meet the audience around National Day.
    Beijing Film Studio is also preparing to contribute new films to the vast audience around National Day, including "Nameless Island" with the theme of the Jinmen naval battle, and "Miner's Lamp" depicting the struggle of Mentougou coal miners against the enemy before liberation. The color films "The Lin Family Shop" and "Flying Over Natural Barrier," which were completed earlier this year, will also be screened around National Day.
    "The Storm," written and directed by Jin Shan; "Song of Youth," written by Yang Mo and directed by Cui Wei and Chen Huai'ai; "Ten Thousand Waters, Thousand Mountains," written by Sun Qian and Cheng Yin, directed by Cheng Yin and Hua Chun; and "The Lin Family Shop," adapted by Xia Yan from Mao Dun's novel and directed by Shui Hua. "The Storm" summarizes the workers' movement during the First Great Revolution, reflecting relatively truly the heroic spirit of the Chinese working class who first stepped onto the political stage, and has a high ideological content and strong artistic appeal; "Song of Youth" depicts the growth process of the typical character Lin Daojing in detail, depicting how intellectuals embarked on the road of revolution under the leadership of the Party. Although it writes about the story of twenty years ago, it still has great practical significance; "Ten Thousand Waters, Thousand Mountains," with its unique majestic and heroic style, reproduces the most difficult part of the Long March, vividly embodying the infinitely tenacious fighting will and revolutionary optimism of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Many epic scenes such as "Forcibly Crossing the Luding Bridge," "Crossing the Snow Mountains," and "Crossing the Grasslands" in the film make the audience feel as if they are on the scene; "The Lin Family Shop" maintains the style of the original work and has been artistically enriched. Through the fate of the Lin family, it portrays the turbulent social situation in China before and after January 28th, exposes the main contradictions of the society at that time, and awakens the people's memories of the past suffering years.
    On the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, Beijing Film Studio's production this year has achieved a new leap forward. The number of feature films that have been completed and will be completed this year is two more than last year, and the ideological, artistic, and technical level of the films has been significantly improved. Among them, many films have quality requirements, technical difficulties, and scales that have never been seen in the history of this factory. The theme of the feature films produced by this factory this year includes "The Storm," "My Family," and "Red Flag Spectrum," which express major historical and political themes, and "Spring and Autumn on the Water," which reflects the current life of sports athletes. The person in charge of this factory pointed out that continuing to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, adhering to putting politics in command and following the mass line under the strong support and specific leadership of Party organizations at all levels is the fundamental reason for the factory's multi-fast, good and economical film production and achieving an all-round leap forward this year. All the creative staff of this film studio regard making excellent films to greet the tenth anniversary of National Day as their combat mission, and are determined to comprehensively improve their creative level through this artistic practice process. In the past year, all employees of the factory have been full of energy, working together with one heart and one mind day and night. The higher-level Party committee and the Party Committee of Beijing Film Studio attached great importance to strengthening the political and ideological work of the creative staff, constantly boosting their energy, opposing conservatism, and making the mass production wave higher and higher. Under the premise of ensuring quality, the "Song of Youth" group completed the effective length of more than 5,000 meters in just over five months. The film studio also formed creative collectives according to the characteristics of directors and actors, giving full play to everyone's enthusiasm and creativity, and making the best use of their talents. Beijing Film Studio also announced the literary script before the film started shooting, and widely solicited the opinions of leaders and audiences; on the other hand, it organized all factory personnel to discuss the script. This not only achieved the effect of pooling the wisdom of the masses, but also enabled actors and even set and prop staff to understand the creative intention, and everyone took the initiative to offer suggestions and tried every means to improve the quality of the film. Even the barber contributed important methods for improving makeup. After the film started shooting, from the factory director to the directors and actors, they continued to refine and meticulously craft the film, and some scripts were repeatedly revised up to fifteen times.
    The person in charge of Beijing Film Studio said: The timely completion of these many films is inseparable from the strong support of the national film industry, the art world, and all aspects. This year, more than 20 fraternal film factories and art units in Beijing, Shanghai, Changchun, Wuhan, Shenyang, Yunnan, Zhejiang and other places directly and indirectly helped Beijing Film Studio. They regarded assisting Beijing Film Studio in completing the filming task to greet the tenth anniversary of National Day as their own task, and supported Beijing Film Studio with the best actors and equipment. Xie Fang, the main actor of "Song of Youth," was originally an actor in the Wuhan Opera House. When the Wuhan Opera House learned that Beijing Film Studio needed her to play Lin Daojing, it immediately transferred her to Beijing. Qin Yi and Kang Tai, some other main actors of "Song of Youth," were reinforcements from Shanghai Film Studio. Li Xiang of Beijing People's Art Theater played Lin Xiangqian in "The Storm," Tian Hua, a famous film actor of the Shenyang Military Region Cultural Troupe, played Lin Xiangqian's wife, and the main actors of "The Storm," Jin Shan, Wu Xue, and Shi Yu, were all "pillars" of the China Youth Art Theater. The Central Orchestra, the Central Academy of Drama, the Children's Theater and many other fraternal units that supported Beijing Film Studio have made re-arrangements for some of their programs to ensure that the film is completed as scheduled. There are even more examples of enthusiastic support from Party committees, troops and people from all walks of life in various places. Overseas Chinese in Nanyang wrote letters to offer suggestions on the plot of "Song of Youth," and many viewers even sent their own draft cast lists. When the "The Storm" crew was shooting outdoor scenes of mass demonstrations in Wuhan and the "Song of Youth" crew was shooting in Beijing, many streets were temporarily closed to traffic, and nearly 30,000 workers, soldiers, and students participated in the filming of this film. Some citizens rummaged through boxes and cabinets to find clothes from more than 30 years ago to wear, making the scenes of the film more realistic. (Attached pictures)

    北影积极摄制新影片迎接国庆
    “风暴”“青春之歌”“万水千山”等影片即将上映
    本报讯　北京电影制片厂正在积极准备以最新最好的影片迎接国庆十周年。这个厂出品的彩色故事片“风暴”、“青春之歌”以及这个厂同“八一”电影制片厂合拍的宽、窄银幕故事片“万水千山”目前基本上已经拍摄完成，将在国庆节前后同观众见面。
    北京电影制片厂准备在国庆节前后贡献给广大观众的新影片还有以金门海战为主题的“无名岛”，描写解放前门头沟煤矿工人对敌斗争的“矿灯”。这个厂在今年早些时候拍制完成的彩色片“林家铺子”和“飞越天险”也将在国庆前后上映。
    金山编导的“风暴”；杨沫编剧，崔嵬、陈怀皑导演的“青春之歌”；孙谦、成荫编剧，成荫、华纯导演的“万水千山”和夏衍根据茅盾小说改编，水华导演的“林家铺子”。“风暴”概括了第一次大革命时期的工人运动，比较真实地反映出第一次登上政治舞台的中国工人阶级的英雄气概，具有相当高的思想性和强烈的艺术感染力；“青春之歌”以林道静这一典型人物的成长过程，细致地描绘了知识分子如何在党的领导下走上革命的道路，虽然它写的是二十年前的故事，但是仍然有着很大的现实意义；“万水千山”以它特有的雄伟、豪迈的风格，再现了长征途中最艰苦的一段历程，生动地体现了中国工农红军无比顽强的战斗意志和革命乐观主义精神，影片中“强渡泸定桥”、“过雪山”、“越草地”等许多史诗般的画面，使观众宛如身临其境；“林家铺子”保持了原作的风格，并在艺术处理上有所丰富。它通过林老板一家人的命运，刻划了“一二八”前后中国社会动荡不安的面貌，揭露了当时社会的主要矛盾，唤醒人民对逝去的苦难的岁月的回忆。
    北京电影制片厂在去年大跃进的基础上，今年的生产又有了新的跃进。这个厂已经完成和即将在年内完成的故事片比去年多了两部，影片的思想性、艺术性、技术水平都有了显著提高，其中有许多影片的质量要求之高、技术之繁难、规模之大都是这个厂的历史上所没有过的。今年这个厂摄制的故事片的主题，既有表现重大历史政治题材的“风暴”、“我的一家”、“红旗谱”，也有反映当前体育运动员生活的“水上春秋”。这个厂的负责人指出，在各级党组织的大力支持和具体领导下，继续贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，坚持政治挂帅和走群众路线，是这个厂今年的影片生产多快好省，取得全面跃进的根本原因。这个制片厂全体创作人员把摄制优秀影片迎接国庆十周年当做自己的战斗任务，并且决心通过这个艺术实践过程来全面提高自己的创作水平。一年以来，该厂全体员工干劲十足，同心同德，夜以继日地辛勤劳动。上级党委和中共北京电影制片厂党委十分注意加强创作人员的政治思想工作，不断地鼓干劲，反保守，使群众性的生产浪潮越来越高。在确保质量的前提下，仅仅用五个月多一点的时间，“青春之歌”组就拍完了有效长度五千多米。这个电影制片厂还根据导演、演员的特点，组成创作集体，充分发挥大家的积极性、创造性，使人尽其才。北京电影制片厂在影片开拍之前还公布了文学剧本，广泛征求领导和观众的意见；另一方面，组织全厂人员讨论剧本，这样做，不仅收到了集思广益之效，也使演员以至布景、道具等各方面的工作人员都能了解创作意图，大家主动献策，千方百计地提高影片质量，连理发师也贡献出改进化装的重要方法。在影片开拍以后，从厂长以至导演和演员，更是不断地精雕细刻，有的剧本反复修改达十五次。
    北京电影制片厂的负责人说：这许多部影片所以能够及时完成是与全国电影界、艺术界以及各方面大力支援分不开的。今年直接、间接帮助北影的，有北京、上海、长春、武汉、沈阳、云南、浙江等地的二十多个兄弟电影厂和艺术单位，他们把协助北影完成迎接国庆十周年的拍片任务，当做是自己的任务，以最好的演员和器材支援北影。“青春之歌”的主要演员谢芳本来是武汉歌剧院的演员。当武汉歌剧院知道北京电影制片厂需要她饰演林道静时，立刻把她调到北京，“青春之歌”另一些主要演员秦怡、康泰，都是上海电影制片厂来的援军。在“风暴”中饰演林祥谦的是北京人民艺术剧院的李翔，饰演林祥谦妻的是沈阳军区文工团的著名电影演员田华，“风暴”的主要演员金山、吴雪、石羽等都是中国青年艺术剧院的“台柱”。中央乐团、中央戏剧学院、儿童剧院等很多支援北影的兄弟单位为了保证影片如期拍成，对自己的某些节目作了重新安排。各地党委、部队和社会各方面人士的热情支持的事例更多。远在南洋的华侨写信来，对“青春之歌”的情节提出建议，不少观众甚至寄来了自己草拟的演员表。当“风暴”组在武汉、“青春之歌”组在北京拍群众示威的外景时，许多条街道都临时断绝了交通，先后有近三万人次的工人、战士、学生参加了这部影片的拍摄工作。有的市民翻箱倒柜，找出三十多年前的服装穿起来，使影片的场景更富有真实感。（附图片）
