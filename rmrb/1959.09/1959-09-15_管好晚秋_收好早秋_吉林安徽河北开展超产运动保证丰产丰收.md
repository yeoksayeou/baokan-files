    Manage the Late Autumn Well, Harvest the Early Autumn Well
    Jilin, Anhui, and Hebei Launch Overproduction Campaigns to Guarantee a Bumper Harvest

    (Xinhua News Agency) Currently in the rural areas of Jilin Province, one aspect is strengthening the late-stage field management of major autumn crops. At the same time, they are actively preparing for the autumn harvest, ensuring good cutting, good harvesting, good threshing, and good storage. They are using the practical actions of reaping ten-tenths of a harvest in a year with ten-tenths good weather to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.
    This year, various people's communes have comprehensively implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and overcome natural disasters such as drought, pests, floods, and wind. After the start of autumn, they generally strengthened the late-stage field management of crops. Sorghum and corn were earthed up, and weeds were removed from soybeans, promoting early maturity and full grains. Now, all kinds of crops are generally growing well, with many plants, thick stalks, large ears, and plump grains. They are beginning to enter the ripening stage, and a bumper harvest is imminent.
    Currently, farmers everywhere, with joyful hearts, are seizing the time to prepare for the autumn harvest. The Sheling People's Commune in Shuangyang County proposed ensuring "four quicks" (quick cutting, quick transportation, quick threshing, quick storage) and "five cleans" (clean cutting, clean transportation, clean picking, clean threshing, clean winnowing), striving to return every grain home. Party committees at all levels have also mobilized the masses to establish more than 510 specialized teams and groups for harvesting, transportation, grain picking, and field protection, with more than 6,000 laborers about to be投入投入 in the intensive autumn harvest. The Chengfa People's Commune in Yushu County transferred more than 660 laborers from the logistics, industry, and sideline production fronts to join the autumn harvest team. The Wanfa People's Commune in Lishu County organized 150 iron and wood workers to repair 1,750 large carts and various autumn harvest tools, and level more than 30 threshing grounds. The Mingcheng Commune in Panshi County also made arrangements for the commune members' lives during the autumn harvest. The entire commune has made more than 16,700 pieces of cotton clothing, quilts, and bedding, and rectified 160 nurseries and kindergartens, strengthening "logistics" work and transferring female laborers to participate in the autumn harvest.
    In the process of preparing for the autumn harvest, rural areas everywhere have received strong support from industrial and commercial departments. The industrial departments of Jiaohe County have produced 100 power threshers, 20,000 sickles, and many other horse tools. The commercial departments of Yongji County actively organized the supply of large quantities of autumn harvest production materials to rural areas.

    (Xinhua News Agency) The people's communes in various parts of Anhui Province, responding to the Party's call to battle, are enthusiastically carrying out an overproduction campaign focused on planting and managing late-autumn crops well, harvesting early-autumn crops well, and vigorously accumulating fertilizer to seize high yields. Brilliant achievements have already been obtained. As of September 8, the province had planted 26.87 million mu of late-autumn crops, an increase of 1.5 times over the late-autumn area last year, exceeding the original plan by more than one million mu. More than 6 million mu of mid-season rice has been harvested, and meticulous harvesting and threshing have been carried out to ensure that every grain is returned to the granary. In terms of late-autumn field management, 10.89 million mu has been weeded and top-dressed, and more than 2 million mu has been checked and replanted. The fertilizer accumulation army has increased from 1.4 million people to 2.8 million people.
    In order to over fulfill various production increase targets, measures have been generally increased in various places. Commune members in Chaoxian County, which is rich in cotton, are fighting for every bud to blossom, every flower to set a boll, and every boll to burst with floss. The Fuxing People's Commune in this county has more than 13,000 people every day, busy with top-dressing, pest control, pruning, and loosening the soil, so that the commune's 25,000 mu of cotton are generally green and leafy, with abundant cotton bolls.
    In areas where the drought has not yet been lifted, the vast number of cadres and commune members are working even harder to fight the drought. They proposed "fighting the drought to the end, adding more measures, vowing to win a bumper harvest, and welcoming National Day." The Nanping People's Commune in Quanjiao County, Bengbu Prefecture, in order to prevent reduced production in drought-stricken land and ensure a bumper harvest in severely drought-stricken areas, actively dug ditches to divert water, dug wells and opened springs, and used water wheels to save seedlings, ensuring resolute drought resistance without rain, and water conservation and storage when it rains. The Xuqiao Production Team of the Shiba Commune in Jiashan County originally estimated that grain production would be reduced by 200,000 jin due to drought. Now, by taking measures such as "concentrated well digging and decentralized management," they are focusing on rescuing sweet potatoes and expanding the planting of late-autumn crops, which can not only make up for disaster losses but also increase production by more than 20,000 jin.
    At present, the vast number of cadres and commune members in Anhui Province are determined to fight a big battle and a hard battle in September to seize a great autumn harvest, strive to over fulfill the agricultural production plan, and offer a gift to the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

    (Xinhua News Agency) The people's communes in various parts of Hebei Province, responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have launched overproduction competitions. While carefully harvesting early autumn crops with sickles, commune members in various places are also processing and managing late autumn crops. In recent days, more than 50 million mu of autumn fields throughout the province have been top-dressed with overproduction fertilizer, and many autumn fields have been weeded an extra time, basically achieving clean ground and weed-free.
    The Party's call has inspired the vast number of commune members to strive for overproduction. The production teams of more than 900 people's communes throughout the province have revised their overproduction targets, with some teams striving to overproduce by another 10% or so on the basis of the original overproduction plan. After the overproduction targets were revised, various communes generally held oath-taking rallies to add enthusiasm and measures for the competition, and the competition movement surged. In the overproduction competition movement in the Kuancheng Commune in Qinglong County, new soil was seen in the fields, and the large fields were weeded all over; new stubble was seen on the edges of the fields, and the weeds on the edges of the fields were铲净割光铲净割光; new vegetables were seen in the vacant land, and autumn vegetables were planted in all the vacant land. In one day, the commune members of the Hanzhuang Management Area of the Simencun Commune in Jiaohe County dug ten drainage ditches with a total length of 20 li, draining all the accumulated water from more than 2,000 mu of waterlogged fields, ensuring the normal growth of crops. Various places have also generally adopted ten major management measures for high-yield sweet potato crops, such as digging hairy roots, top-dressing, earthing up, loosening the soil, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, to promote tuber growth.

    管好晚秋　收好早秋
    吉林安徽河北开展超产运动保证丰产丰收
    据新华社讯　吉林省各地农村目前一面加强大秋作物后期田间管理；一面积极进行秋收准备，保证作到割好、收好、打好、保管好，用十成年景十成收的实际行动来迎接建国十周年。
    今年各地人民公社全面贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，战胜了旱、虫、水、风等自然灾害。入秋后，又普遍加强作物后期田间管理，高粱、苞米放了秋垅，大豆拔了大草，促进作物早熟，籽粒丰满。现在各种庄稼普遍生育良好，棵多、秆粗、穗大、粒饱，开始进入成熟阶段，丰收在即。
    目前，各地农民怀着喜悦的心情，抓紧进行秋收准备。双阳县奢岭人民公社提出，保证做到四快（快割、快拉、快打、快入仓）、五净（割净、拉净、拣净、打净、扬净），力争颗粒还家。各级党委还发动群众建立收割、运输、拣粮、护场等五百一十多个专业队、组，六千多名劳力即将投入突击秋收。榆树县城发人民公社从后勤、工业、副业生产战线上抽调六百六十多名劳力编入秋收队伍。梨树县万发人民公社组织一百五十名铁木匠，修理大车和各种秋收工具一千七百五十多件，平整场院三十多个。磐石县明城公社并对秋收中的社员生活作了安排，全社已作出棉衣、被、褥等一万六千七百多件，整顿托儿所、幼儿园一百六十处，加强了“后勤”工作，抽调妇女劳力参加秋收。
    在秋收准备过程中，各地农村得到了工业和商业部门的大力支援。蛟河县工业部门已生产动力打稻机一百台，镰刀二万把，以及其它很多马具等。永吉县商业部门积极组织供应农村大批秋收生产资料。
    据新华社讯　安徽省各地人民公社响应党的战斗号召，正在热烈开展的以种好、管好晚秋，收好早秋，大搞积肥，夺取高产的超产运动，已经得到了辉煌战果。截至9月8日，全省已种晚秋二千六百八十七万亩，比去年晚秋面积扩大一点五倍，超过原计划一百多万亩。中稻已收割六百多万亩，并做到细收细打，颗粒归仓。在晚秋田间管理方面已锄草、追肥一千零八十九万亩，查苗补苗二百多万亩。积肥大军由一百四十万人增加到二百八十万人。
    为了超额完成各项增产指标，各地普遍增加了措施。盛产棉花的巢县各人民公社的社员正为蕾蕾开花、花花座桃、桃桃吐絮而战。这个县复兴人民公社每天有一万三千多人，紧张地进行追肥、灭虫、整枝、松土，使全社二万五千亩棉花，普遍青枝绿叶，棉桃累累。
    旱情迄今未解除的地区，广大干部和社员越抗旱干劲越大，他们提出“抗旱到底，措施加码，誓夺丰收，迎接国庆”。蚌埠专区的全椒县南屏人民公社，为使受旱土地不减产，严重旱区保丰收，积极开沟引水，打井开泉，车水救苗，做到无雨坚决抗旱，有雨保水蓄水。嘉山县石坝公社徐桥生产队，原先估计因旱要减产粮食二十万斤，现在采取“集中打井、分片管理”等措施，重点抢救山芋，并扩种晚秋作物，不仅可弥补受灾损失，还能超产两万多斤。
    目前，安徽省广大干部和社员，决心大战、苦战9月，夺取秋季大丰收，力争超额完成农业生产计划，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。
    据新华社讯　河北省各地人民公社，响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，纷纷开展超产竞赛。各地社员在挥镰细收早秋作物的同时，都对晚秋作物加工管理。最近几天，全省有五千多万亩秋田追了超产肥，许多秋田多锄了一遍草，基本上达到了地净草光。
    党的号召，鼓舞了广大社员力争超产的干劲。全省九百多个人民公社的生产队都修订了超产指标，有些队在原来超产计划的基础上，力争再超产10％左右。超产指标修订以后，各公社普遍召开了添干劲加措施的竞赛誓师大会，竞赛运动风起云涌。青龙县宽城公社在超产竞赛运动中，作到了田垅见新土，把大田普锄一遍；地边见新楂，铲净割光地边草；闲地见新菜，把闲地都种上了秋菜。交河县寺门村公社韩庄管理区的社员一天就挖了十条排水渠，总长达二十里，把二千多亩涝田的积水全部排净，保证了庄稼正常生长。各地还对甘薯高产作物，普遍采取了挖毛根、追肥、培土、扒地、防治病虫害等十大管理措施，促进薯块生长。（附图片）
