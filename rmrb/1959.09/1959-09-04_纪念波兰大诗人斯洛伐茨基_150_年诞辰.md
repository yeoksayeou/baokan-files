    Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the Birth of the Great Polish Poet Słowacki
      September 4th of this year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Juliusz Słowacki, the great poet of the first half of the 19th century in Poland. Additionally, April 3rd of this year was the 110th anniversary of his death. Therefore, Poland has designated this year as "Słowacki Year," commemorating this great poet through various activities.
    Juliusz Słowacki, like his contemporary, the great poet Adam Mickiewicz, is one of the most brilliant names in the history of Polish literature: both used their poems filled with revolutionary passion to fight for the national independence and liberation of the Polish people; they were also both founders of Polish revolutionary romantic poetry. Słowacki was a participant in the Warsaw Uprising in December 1830, during which he used poems such as "Ode to Freedom" and "Hymn" to encourage the Polish people to rise up and join the struggle. After the failure of the Warsaw Uprising in 1830, he emigrated abroad. When the uprising of the people of Poznań broke out in 1848, he resolutely returned to the country despite serious illness, throwing himself into battle, at which time he wrote the militant poem "Long Live the People of Poznań!" However, this uprising was soon defeated as well, and he had to return to Paris, where he died the following year. His coffin was not moved back to Poland until 1927. Now, he and Adam Mickiewicz both rest together in the underground tomb of Wawel Castle in Kraków. Although Juliusz Słowacki's life was short, he left us with many works, including short poems, long poems, plays, and numerous letters. His name is not unfamiliar to our Chinese readers. As early as 1907, Mr. Lu Xun mentioned his name in his "On the Power of Mara Poetry," and commented on his works. To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the poet's birth this year, the Sino-Polish Friendship Association, the Chinese Writers Association, and the Beijing Library jointly held a memorial meeting last night. At the meeting, Ge Baoquan gave a report on "Słowacki's Life and Works"; the Beijing Library held an exhibition of the poet's life photos and his works. In addition, "World Literature" published his poetry works, and People's Literature Publishing House will also publish a selection of his works. We are now specially publishing the poet's representative work "Hymn" here to commemorate him.

### 纪念波兰大诗人斯洛伐茨基150年诞辰

    纪念波兰大诗人斯洛伐茨基150年诞辰
      今年的9月4日，是波兰十九世纪前半叶的伟大诗人尤利乌斯·斯洛伐茨基诞生的一百五十周年，同时今年的4月3日，又是他逝世的一百一十周年，因此波兰就将今年确定为“斯洛伐茨基年”，通过各种活动来纪念这位伟大的诗人。
    尤利乌斯·斯洛伐茨基和他同时代的伟大诗人亚当·密茨凯维支一样，是波兰文学史上最为辉煌的名字：他们都用自己的充满革命激情的诗歌，来为波兰人民的民族独立和解放而斗争；他们同时又都是波兰的革命浪漫主义诗歌的奠基人。斯洛伐茨基是1830年12月华沙革命起义的参加者，当时他曾用“自由颂”和“颂歌”等诗，激励波兰人民起来参加斗争。1830年华沙起义失败后，他就侨居到国外去。当1848年波兹南人民的起义爆发时，他不顾重病决然返国，投入战斗，这时他又写成了“波兹南人万岁！”的战斗诗歌。但是这次起义不久也遭到失败，他不得不重返巴黎，第二年就死在当地。他的灵柩直到1927年方迁回波兰，现在他和亚当·密茨凯维支都一同长眠在克拉科夫城瓦维尔宫的地下墓室里。尤利乌斯·斯洛伐茨基的一生虽然是短促的，但他却留给我们不少的作品，其中有短诗、长诗、剧本和书信多篇。对于我们中国的读者们，他的名字也不是生疏的。鲁迅先生远在1907年发表的“摩罗诗力说”一文中，就提到他的名字，并评介过他的作品。当今年诗人诞辰一百五十周年纪念时，中国波兰友好协会、中国作家协会和北京图书馆在昨晚联合举行了纪念会，会上由戈宝权作了“斯洛伐茨基的生平及其创作”的报告；北京图书馆举办了诗人的生平图片及其作品的展览会，此外，“世界文学”上发表了他的诗歌作品，人民文学出版社还将出版他的选集。我们现在特将诗人的代表作品“颂歌”发表于此，以示纪念。
