The Tajiks: Past and Present
By our correspondents Yang Kexian and Zhang Kecan

"Having forgotten all the food I've eaten in my life,
I can never forget my mother's milk;
Having forgotten all the words I've heard in my life,
I can never forget the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

This is a folk song that is sung on the Pamir Plateau, the roof of the world. This song expresses the Tajik people's passion for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who have brought them a bright and happy life.

For many years, the snow-capped mountains and rapids of the Pamir Plateau have hindered the Tajiks' contact with the outside world. Who knows what a life of poverty the Tajik people once led in this remote, high-altitude mountain area more than 3,000 meters above sea level. All year round, they wore tattered sheepskins and ate a meager amount of milk and yogurt that could not keep them warm or well-fed. The Kuomintang reactionaries did not do a single good thing here. Heavy taxes and levies, as numerous as cattle and sheep, fell on the poor Tajiks. The lambs born each year were not even enough to pay the taxes, and the number of livestock decreased year by year. This is a true picture of the Tajik people's life in the old days.

Ten years after liberation, what great changes have taken place in the Pamir Plateau? How are our ethnic minorities, who are so small in number, living? We took a trip by car to the Pamir Plateau for a visit.

The Pamir Plateau is south of Kashgar. The treacherous road twists and turns through the overlapping high mountains. For every kilometer the car travels, it rises twenty meters. The increasingly high road finally leads us to the foot of Mount Kongur, 7,719 meters above sea level. The snow peaks are connected to the sky, and the accumulated snow shines with a cold light. Although it is midsummer, the cold wind is biting. I still feel cold even wearing a leather coat. The car travels around Mount Kongur, as if driving along a cliff. The hundreds-meter-high rocky cliffs next to the road look like they are about to collapse, and the muddy waves of the river below rumble, making people feel frightened. This is a mountain road carved out by road construction workers at the risk of their lives. It has opened up a path to happiness for the Tajik people.

One summer before the road was open to traffic, we followed a camel caravan to the foot of Mount Murgab, halfway to Tashkurgan. We crossed mountains and rivers along the way and walked for eighteen days. The high mountains lacked oxygen, and floods broke out, taking the lives of eight camels. Now that the road has been built, it only takes one day to get from Kashgar to Tashkurgan. Cars have transported a large number of new agricultural tools, daily necessities, and power generation equipment to the Tajik people, and local livestock products and local specialties have also been transported out in a timely manner. The economic life of farmers and herdsmen is thriving. People have developed a close relationship with cars.

The Tajiks are one of the smallest ethnic groups in China, with a total of more than 14,000 people, of which more than 8,000 live in the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County in the eastern Pamir. The ancient castle in this county was destroyed in a war before liberation. The new town was built after liberation. Here are the offices of the autonomous county's party and government, the People's Bank, the post and telecommunications bureau, the Xinhua Bookstore, the club, the outpatient and inpatient departments of the county hospital, and the houses of the local products, department stores, and grain outlets affiliated to the county's commercial bureau. It has become the political, economic, and cultural center of the autonomous county today. We strolled in the new city and saw Tajik farmers and herdsmen coming in and out of the various outlets of the Commercial Bureau, selecting their favorite corduroy, floral cloth, black tea, and sugar.

The snow-capped mountains are an inexhaustible "reservoir" for agricultural production in the Pamirs. However, the backward, decentralized, and individual nomadic life in the past restricted the development of agriculture. Until the eve of liberation, only more than 10,500 mu of land were cultivated here. Every spring, the Tajiks scattered seeds on the land and drove their cattle and sheep to graze in the distant high mountains. Due to lack of management, the yield was very low, with an average of only 100 jin of grain per person. The rest of the grain had to be transported from Kashgar over mountains and rivers. Each mule could only carry a hundred jin or so every twenty days or so, and it had to avoid the dangerous flood season for half a year. This difficult situation meant that the vast number of poor herdsmen could not eat enough grain all year round.

"Now it's completely different!" A field team leader named Kasimu in the Combat Commune told us: "Because the people's communes are organized, livestock are grazed in a unified and concentrated manner, which saves 60% of the labor force for agricultural production." This year, the cultivated land area in the county has been expanded to more than 25,000 mu. Tajik herdsmen have learned from Han and Uyghur farmers how to use new agricultural tools and have learned a series of cultivation techniques such as seed selection, fertilization, and rational close planting. We rode horses to the farmland of the Combat People's Commune in the suburbs. Tajik herdsmen were watering the fields with snow water in twos and threes. They used wooden sticks to break up the soil clumps in the highland barley fields so that the snow water could soak into every corner. They are spending hard work to make this year's grain output reach self-sufficiency and end the grain shortage situation in the history of the Pamir Plateau forever.

In the past, the Pamirs only grew a few kinds of cold-resistant crops such as highland barley, spring wheat, and peas. Now, oil crops such as rapeseed, flax, and sunflowers and vegetables have also been added. In the Yarkand and Mushtag areas, where there is hot spring irrigation, rice has also been tried for the first time.

    塔吉克人的今昔
    本报记者　杨克现　张克灿
    “把一生吃过的东西都忘记了，
    就是忘记不了母亲的奶汁；
    把一生听过的话全忘记了，
    就是忘记不了共产党和毛主席的恩情。”
    这是流传在世界屋脊帕米尔高原上的一首歌谣。这首歌唱出了塔吉克人民对于给他们带来光明和幸福生活的共产党和毛主席的激情。
    多少年来，帕米尔高原的雪山和急流，阻碍了塔吉克人和外界的交往。有谁知道在这拔海三千多米边远的高寒山区，塔吉克人民曾经过着那样贫困的生活。他们终年穿着破羊皮，吃的是不能温饱的少量牛奶和酸奶子。国民党反动派在这里没有作过一件好事，多如牛羊的苛捐杂税落在贫苦的塔吉克人身上，每年生下的羊羔还不够缴税，牲畜连年减少。这便是旧日塔吉克人民生活的写照。
    解放十年了，帕米尔高原究竟发生了多么大的变化？我国这样一个人数很少的民族生活过得怎么样了？我们乘坐着汽车，到帕米尔高原作了一次旅行访问。
    帕米尔高原在喀什的南面，艰险的公路曲折在重重叠叠的高山中，汽车每行驶一公里，便要升高二十米。越来越高的公路终于把我们引到拔海七千七百十九米的公格尔雪山前。雪峰接连天际，积雪寒光耀眼。虽然盛夏，冷风竦竦。我穿上皮大衣还觉得冷。汽车绕着公格尔雪山行走，就像从悬崖绝壁上行驶过去，路旁几百米的石崖，眼看就要倒塌下来，山下河流，泥浪滚滚令人看了心惊胆颤。这是筑路工人冒着生命危险凿开的山路。它打通了塔吉克人民幸福之途。
    公路通车前的一个夏天，我们曾经随着一帮骆驼队去过到塔什库尔干中途的慕格山下，沿途翻山涉水，直走了十八天。高山缺氧，洪水暴发，夺去了八峰骆驼的生命。如今公路修通了，从喀什到塔什库尔干一天便可到达。汽车给塔吉克人民运去了大量新式农具、日用百货和发电设备，当地的畜产品和土特产也及时运出去了。农牧民的经济生活蒸蒸日上。人们对于汽车产生了亲密的感情。
    塔吉克是我国人口最少的民族之一，共有一万四千多人，其中有八千多人散居在帕米尔东部的塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县境内。这个县古老的城堡在解放前一次战火中焚毁了。新的城镇是解放以后建立起来的。这里有自治县党和政府的办公室、有人民银行、邮电局、新华书店、俱乐部、县卫生院的门诊和住院部，以及县商业局所属的土产、百货、粮食等门市部的房舍。它已经成为自治县今日政治、经济和文化的中心。我们在新城中漫步，只见商业局各个门市部里，塔吉克农牧民进进出出，选购他们喜爱的条绒、花布、红茶和砂糖。
    雪山，是帕米尔农业生产取之不尽的大“水库”。可是过去那种落后、分散和个体的游牧生活，限制了农业的发展，直到解放前夕，这里才耕种了一万零五百多亩土地。每年春天，塔吉克人在土地上撒下种籽，就赶着牛羊到很远的高山放牧，因为缺乏管理，产量很低，每人平均只有粮一百斤。其他的粮食要翻山越岭从喀什运来，一头毛驴每次来回二十多天只能驮百把斤，还得避过半年危险的洪水期。这种困难的情况，使得广大贫苦牧民一年到头吃不上粮食。
    “现在完全不同了！”战斗公社有个名叫卡思木的农田队长向我们讲到：“由于组织了人民公社，牲畜统一集中放牧，便节省出60％的劳动力从事农业生产。”今年，全县耕地面积扩大到了两万五千多亩。塔吉克牧民向汉族、维吾尔族农民学会了使用新式农具，学会了选种、施肥、合理密植等一系列的耕作技术。我们骑马来到城郊战斗人民公社的农田，塔吉克牧民正在三三两两地引用雪水浇地，他们用木棍打碎青稞田中的土块，让雪水浸润到各个角落。他们花费辛勤的劳动，要使今年的粮食产量达到自给，永远结束帕米尔高原历史上缺粮的局面。
    从前帕米尔只种一些青稞、春麦、豌豆等种类极少的耐寒作物，现在还增种了油菜、胡麻、向日葵等油料作物和蔬菜。在有温泉灌溉的慕士塔格地早暖的叶尔羌两个公社，还第一次试种了水稻。
