Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. People of minority nationality regions in various areas have been holding seminars, radio rallies, and mobilization meetings in recent days, enthusiastically hailing the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes for bringing prosperity and happiness to minority nationality regions. They are determined to respond to the fighting call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with even greater vigor.

    When the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached the vast grasslands of Xilin Gol, Ordos, and Hulunbuir in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which had just achieved a bumper harvest in animal husbandry, members of the Mongolian, Daur, and Evenk communes on the grasslands were beaming and overjoyed, expressing their determination to advance on the victory. At the mobilization radio rally held in Xilin Gol League, commune members and cadres of all ethnic groups in the league resolutely stated that, based on this year's bumper harvest in animal husbandry and the promising agricultural harvest, they would ensure that the total livestock growth rate reaches 33% and the net growth rate reaches 13% next year. Dao Nai (Mongolian), the deputy captain of the Yilelite People's Commune Dabuxilete Brigade in Abaga Banner, said at the meeting: Thanks to the implementation of communization last year, our commune's livestock has increased greatly this year, with a total livestock growth rate of 41.87% and a net growth rate of 31.7%. On behalf of all commune members, he used a large number of facts to denounce the attacks and slanders against the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes by enemies at home and abroad. After discussing the communique and resolutions, the members of the Qiao'erbao People's Commune in the suburbs of Hohhot decided to plant 10,000 mu of vegetables to support the needs of the city. More than 3,000 people are now planting vegetables early and late, while also strengthening field management such as thinning and weeding of autumn vegetables that have already emerged from the soil.

    In Baise Special District, Guangxi, where the Zhuang people live in concentrated communities, commune members of all ethnic groups studied the communique and resolutions while fighting in the fields, rushing to hoe and plant. In the fields, Zhuang women with blue cloth headscarves were busy weeding and topdressing, and strong young people were rushing to plant sweet potatoes on the hillsides. They decided to comprehensively complete this year's over-production target plan on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the bumper harvest in the first half of the year. Cadres and members of the Nabi Commune unanimously believed that the People's Commune had firmly established itself in the hometown of the Zhuang people, and the extraordinary bumper harvest in the first half of the year was proof of the commune's unparalleled superiority. After discussion, the major brigades revised their production targets. The Datong Brigade originally planned to produce 840,000 jin of grain this year, but now it is determined to exceed the target by 300,000 jin. The original target for sugar cane production was 46,000 jin, but now it is determined to exceed the target by 24,000 jin. The Qitang Brigade decided to cultivate and fertilize the intermediate and late rice three times each, applying 90 dan of fertilizer per mu, and to exceed the target by 40,000 jin on the basis of a target of 110,000 jin. After the communique and resolutions reached the Shangfeng People's Commune in Bama Yao Autonomous County, which has historically lacked food, members of the Yao, Zhuang, Han, and other ethnic groups shouted together, "Long live the Great Leap Forward! Long live the People's Commune!" This commune is located in the Xishan District, an old revolutionary base area, where there are overlapping stone mountains, little land, and a shortage of water. Before 1958, there was a food shortage every year. After communization, under the leadership of the Party, commune members of all ethnic groups united as one, leveled mountains and opened water sources, expanding the planting area by 20.6%. Commune members worked hard day and night, and last year's total grain output increased by 82% compared with 1957, changing from food shortage to surplus. Corn also had a bumper harvest in the first half of this year. The commune also vigorously developed livestock breeding according to the characteristics of the mountainous area, with an average of 3.8 pigs and 1.4 sheep per household. Currently, inspired by the communique and resolutions, commune members are fighting hard to manage the late rice fields, striving for a bumper harvest of late rice that exceeds the target, and a great harvest in sideline occupations.

    When discussing the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Hui people on all production fronts in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were greatly encouraged, and a new upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice economy was immediately launched in many places. In Guyuan Special District, where the Hui people live in concentrated communities, after the Guyuan Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory held a factory-wide leap forward mobilization meeting, workshops, groups, and individuals wrote letters of determination and put forward many rationalization proposals for increasing production and practicing economy. The workers of the Guyuan County Textile Factory expressed their support for the communique and resolutions with practical actions that constantly broke production records. Zhu Qichang, a worker in the wool spinning workshop, created a new record of producing 33 scarves a day, but this record was soon broken by Lu Junyi's record of producing 58 scarves a day. After holding a seminar, the members of the Huinong Baofeng Commune, where the Hui people live in concentrated communities, immediately pushed the autumn field over-production movement to a new climax. The cadres of the Yinhe Brigade led the commune members to topdress the corn late at night, and the fertilizer accumulation professional group of the Xinghuo Brigade dug 31 compost pits and chopped more than 130,000 jin of Artemisia grass in one day.

    People of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region expressed their firm support for the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party at various gatherings, and their determination to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule and exceed the quota. Kuerban Ali (Kazak), the governor of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, said: Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line and the Party's ethnic policy, the various construction undertakings of the autonomous prefecture have achieved a new leap forward this year on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. This year, the prefecture's sown area has been expanded by 750,000 mu compared with last year; the total output of various grains is expected to increase by about 28% compared with last year. The total output of oil crops has increased by nearly double compared with last year. The total number of livestock has increased by a net 12% compared with the same period last year. Such great achievements in agricultural and animal husbandry production are inseparable from the superiority of the People's Commune. He said! We must muster greater efforts, launch a movement to increase production and practice economy, and we will surely achieve new and greater victories. Sidiq Tudiyev, the vice governor of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture, said: Thanks to the Great Leap Forward, the autonomous prefecture has now built two 28-cubic-meter blast furnaces and produced more than 1,000 tons of good iron, which is something that the Kirghiz people have never had in history. This year's summer grain crop, wheat, has increased by more than 10 million jin compared with last year, and livestock has increased by more than 100,000 head. The summer grain purchase task was overfulfilled on August 20. Therefore, the People's Commune is now most loved by the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture, and any slander against the People's Commune will be completely defeated. Uygur commune members of the Shorvak Brigade of the Fenghuo People's Commune in Hotan County under the Kunlun Mountains expressed their determination to complete and overfulfill this year's production plan at a seminar. This year, the commune's wheat production increased by 30% compared with last year, and barley production increased by 20%. Commune members proposed to focus on autumn field management in September, strive to increase cotton production by 30% compared with last year, increase late corn production by 20%, and prepare for winter sowing before September 5 to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    The people of minority nationalities who live along the thousands of miles of border in Yunnan have used countless facts to prove how the Party's General Line has inspired, guided, and organized the infinite wisdom and strength of all ethnic groups, and how the Great Leap Forward has enabled minority nationalities, who were originally in a primitive and backward state of slash-and-burn cultivation, to transition to socialism across the centuries at a speed of "one day equals twenty years." They said that they would laugh in their sleep when they talked about the Great Leap Forward last year. Zhao Cunxin, the governor of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, said that the water conservancy projects built last year exceeded the total of the previous years since liberation, and grain production increased by 38%, which is the largest annual growth rate in history. He said that the greater the Great Leap Forward, the greater the benefits it brings to the people of all ethnic groups. The Aini people of Nannuo Mountain established the Heroic People's Commune. In this famous hometown of "Pu'er tea," tea production increased by 40% in the Great Leap Forward, and the newly opened fields were equivalent to the previous total. Each laborer earned 211 yuan a year from grain and tea crops alone. They had needed to transport grain from other places for thousands of years, but now they have become able to transfer grain to support towns. Dao Jingban, the governor of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, listed the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in the prefecture, explaining that the Party's General Line reflects the greatest interests and demands of the people of all ethnic groups. In the past, the prefecture had a poor industrial base, and even handicrafts had not been separated from agriculture. However, last year, there were more than 500 factories and mines run by the county and above, and they could produce steel, changing the backward situation where even agricultural tools were transported from other places. At the mobilization meeting held by the Va people in the Kawa Mountains, more than 20 agricultural cooperatives responded to each other's challenges, guaranteeing "not afraid of mosquito bites, not afraid of sweating a lot, not afraid of the sun, not afraid of heavy rain," increasing production, and striving to complete and overfulfill production plans. The Manjinlan Agricultural Cooperative on the banks of the Lancang River in Xishuangbanna, the Hongqi Joint Cooperative of the Dai ethnic group in Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and the Santaishan Joint Cooperative composed of Jingpo, Benglong, Lisu, and other ethnic groups have all re-examined measures, strengthened field management, and revised and expanded the planting plan for small spring crops, ensuring that the large spring crops, small spring crops, and economic crops all leap forward together, and all demand to achieve a bumper harvest. After the Hongqi Joint Cooperative of Dehong Autonomous Prefecture issued a letter of friendship competition to fraternal agricultural cooperatives in the border area, all the members of the first production team rushed to harvest 24 mu of early rice that afternoon.

    大跃进使少数民族更上一层楼
    各地少数民族响应党的号召决心提前和超额完成生产计划
    新华社1日讯　各地少数民族地区人民连日来纷纷举行座谈会、广播大会和誓师大会，热情欢呼总路线、大跃进、人民公社给少数民族地区带来了繁荣和幸福，决心用更大的干劲响应党的八中全会的战斗号召。
    当党的八届八中全会公报和决议传到刚刚取得畜牧业大丰收的内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒、鄂尔多斯和呼伦贝尔等大草原的时候，草原上人民公社的蒙古、达斡尔、鄂温克等族社员们，眉飞色舞，一片欢腾，纷纷表示决心乘胜前进。在锡林郭勒盟召开的誓师广播大会上，全盟人民公社的各族社员和干部坚决表示，要在今年牧业大丰收和农业丰收在望的基础上，保证明年牲畜的总增率达到33％，纯增率达到13％。阿巴嘎旗伊勒利特人民公社达布希勒特大队副队长道乃（蒙古族）在大会上说：由于去年实现了公社化，今年我们公社的牲畜大大增加，牲畜总增率达41.87％，纯增率达31.7％。他代表全社社员用大量事实痛斥了国内外敌人对总路线、大跃进和人民公社的攻击和污蔑。呼和浩特市郊区巧尔报人民公社的社员们，讨论了公报和决议后，决心种菜一万亩，支援城市需要。现在每天有三千多人起早贪黑地抢种蔬菜，同时还加强了对已出土秋菜的间苗、锄草等田间管理工作。
    广西僮族聚居的百色专区的各族社员一边学习公报和决议，一边奋战田间抢锄抢种。田野里蓝布包头的僮族妇女，忙着耘田追肥，山坡上健壮的青年突击播种红薯，他们决定在1958年大跃进和上半年大丰收的基础上，全面完成今年超包产计划。那毕公社干部和社员一致认为人民公社在僮族的家乡巩固地站稳了脚根，上半年的特大丰收就是公社无比优越性的证明。经过讨论，各大队纷纷修订了生产指标，大同大队原来今年粮食包产八十四万斤，现在决心超包产三十万斤，蔗糖原来包产四万六千斤，现在决心超产两万四千斤。七塘大队决定对中晚稻三耘三追，每亩追肥九十担，在包产十一万斤的基础上超产四万斤。公报和决议传到巴马瑶族自治县历来缺粮的上峰人民公社后，瑶、僮、汉等族社员一齐高呼“大跃进万岁！人民公社万岁！”这个公社位于老革命根据地西山区，这里石山重叠，地少水缺，1958年以前年年缺粮。公社化后，在党的领导下各族社员团结一致，平山地开水源，扩大了种植面积20.6％，社员日夜苦战，去年粮食总产量比1957年增长82％，由缺粮变成余粮了。今年上半年玉米又获得丰收。公社并根据山区特点大力发展家畜，平均每户有猪三点八头，羊一点四头。目前社员们在公报和决议的鼓舞下，正大战晚稻田间管理关，力争晚稻超包产，副业大丰收。
    宁夏回族自治区各个生产战线上的回族人民，在讨论党的八中全会的公报和决议时，受到巨大鼓舞，许多地方立即掀起了增产节约运动的新高潮。在回族聚居的固原专区，固原农牧机械厂的全体职工举行了全厂跃进誓师大会以后，各车间、小组和个人，纷纷写出决心书，提出了许多增产节约的合理化建议。固原县纺织厂的工人以不断刷新生产纪录的实际行动，表示自己对公报和决议的拥护。毛纺车间工人朱其昌创造了日产三十三条围巾的新纪录，但是这个纪录很快又被路俊义日产五十八条的纪录所突破。回族聚居的惠农宝丰公社的社员们在举行座谈后，立即把秋田超产运动推向新的高潮，银河大队的干部带领社员深夜给玉米追肥，星火大队的积肥专业组，一天就挖好了三十一个沤肥坑，打了十三万多斤蒿草。
    新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民，在各种集会上表示坚决拥护党的八届八中全会的公报和决议，决心提前和超额完成今年的生产计划。伊犁哈萨克族自治州州长库尔班阿里（哈萨克族）说：在党的总路线和党的民族政策光辉照耀下，自治州各项建设事业在去年大跃进的基础上，今年又获得了新的跃进。今年全州的播种面积比去年扩大了七十五万亩；各种粮食总产量预计可比去年增产28％左右。油料作物总产量比去年增加将近一倍。各种牲畜总头数比去年同期净增12％。农牧业生产取得这样的巨大成绩是和人民公社的优越性分不开的。他说！鼓足更大干劲，开展增产节约运动，一定会取得新的更大的胜利。克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州副州长司的克·吐地由夫说：由于大跃进，现在自治州已建成两个二十八立方米高炉，并生产了好铁一千多吨，这是柯尔克孜族历史上从未有过的事。今年夏粮作物小麦比去年增加一千多万斤，牲畜增加十万多头，夏粮征购任务已在8月20日超额完成。因此人民公社现在是最受全州各族人民热爱的，任何诬蔑人民公社的谰言都会遭到彻头彻尾的失败。昆仑山下和田县烽火人民公社肖尔瓦克大队的维吾尔族社员在座谈会上纷纷表示坚决完成和超额完成今年的生产计划。今年这个公社的小麦比去年增产了30％，青稞增产20％。社员提出要在9月份狠抓秋田管理，力争棉花比去年增产三成，晚玉米增产两成，并且把冬播的准备工作提前在9月5日以前做好，迎接国庆十周年。
    聚居在云南边疆数千里国境线上的少数民族人民以无数的事实，证明党的总路线怎样启发、指导和组织了各族人民的无穷智慧和力量，大跃进又怎样使原来处在刀耕火种原始落后的少数民族，以“一天等于二十年”的速度，跨世纪地向社会主义过渡。他们说，谈到去年大跃进，睡着也会笑起来。西双版纳傣族自治州州长召存信谈到去年一年兴修的水利超过解放几年来的总和，粮食增产三成八，是历年增长速度最大的一年。他说越是大跃进，给各族人民带来的利益也越大。南糯山僾伲人办起英雄人民公社，这个著名的“普洱茶”故乡在大跃进中，茶叶增产40％，新开的田相当于以往的总数，每个劳动力一年仅粮、茶两项作物就达二百一十一元，千百年来需要外地运粮供应，变为外调粮食支援城镇了。德宏傣族景颇族自治州州长刀京版列举本州大跃进的成就，说明党的总路线反映了各民族人民最大的利益和要求。这个州过去工业底子差，连手工业都没有从农业中独立出来，但是去年县以上办的厂矿就有五百多个，并能生产钢铁，改变了过去连农具都是外地运进的落后状况。佧佤山上佧佤人举行的誓师大会上，有二十多个农业社的社员互相应战挑战，保证“不怕蚊子叮，不怕流汗多，不怕太阳晒，不怕大雨淋。”增加生产，力争完成和超额完成生产计划。西双版纳澜沧江畔的曼紧蓝农业社、德宏傣族景颇族自治州的傣族红旗联社，景颇、崩龙、傈僳等多民族组成的三台山联社等，都重新研究措施，加强田间管理，修订扩种小春计划，保证大春、小春和经济作物齐头跃进，都要求做到丰收。德宏自治州红旗联社向边疆各兄弟农业社发出友谊竞赛倡议书之后，第一生产队全体社员，当天下午就抢收了二十四亩早稻。
