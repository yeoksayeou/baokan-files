Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 5th: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" held a meeting of its directors today, deciding to launch a high tide of the movement during the upcoming extraordinary session of the Diet this autumn, to force the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to dissolve the Diet, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and prevent the signing of a new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

To this end, the conference decided to call on Japanese labor unions and youth, women, religious, cultural, and other groups to participate in the movement led by the National Conference, and to organize mass protest movements in various regions, focusing on the struggle in workers' workplaces.

The conference decided that during the sixth national unified action to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on September 8th, all unions of national civil servants and public corporations would hold workplace rallies together; private companies' unions would be called upon to hold limited-term strikes and workplace rallies, while protest demonstrations would be held throughout the country. On the same day, a central rally will be held in Sunagawa Town, Tokyo.

Faced with the vigorous struggle of the Japanese people against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Kishi Nobusuke group is instigating right-wing groups to undermine this movement, which concerns the peace and independence of Japan. Today, the National Federation for Revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was even established in Tokyo. More than 400 former soldiers and a group of paid writers specializing in reactionary propaganda participated in this fascist organization.

Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: According to Tokyo Radio's broadcast today, the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will hold a national representative conference on September 16th to push the movement to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" to a new high tide.

It is reported that more than 500 representatives from all over the country will participate in this conference, and they will discuss issues such as strengthening the national unified action to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," the current situation, and strengthening organizational strength, and determine the current movement policy.

The radio station said that the National Conference believes that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet will not stop revising the "Security Treaty," and when its attempt to revise the "Security Treaty" is stopped, that is when it will come to an end. Therefore, preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty" and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet are the same thing. In order to win the victory of the struggle, the National Conference should link mass struggle with Diet struggle.

The radio station predicted that at this national representative conference, the National Conference will emphasize the importance of mobilizing workers to carry out strength struggles and uniting farmers and small and medium-sized business owners to jointly carry out the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: Tokyo News: The Central Committee of the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations decided on an action plan at today's meeting, which emphasized the need to strengthen the struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The action plan calls on Japanese students to participate in the sixth national unified action to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" scheduled for September 8th through means such as strikes, marches, and mass rallies. When the oral defense of the "Sunagawa Incident" against the U.S. military base concludes on September 18th at the Supreme Court, this nationwide student organization will call on Japanese students to take joint action with workers.

According to this plan, members of "Zengakuren" will strengthen strike activities when the Kishi Nobusuke government may sign a new "Security Treaty" with the United States—October, and when the Japanese Diet may deliberate on this treaty—November and December, expressing their determination to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty." The action plan emphasizes that "Zengakuren" should closely cooperate with the National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and other joint struggle organizations throughout the country when launching the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The "Zengakuren" Central Committee meeting opened three days ago.

    “阻止修改日美‘安全条约’国民会议”号召日本人民
    掀起打倒岸内阁斗争的新高潮
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天举行干事会会议，决定在秋季召开国会临时会议期间掀起一个运动的高潮，迫使岸信介内阁解散国会，并且打倒岸信介内阁，阻止签订新的日美军事同盟条约。
    为此，会议决定号召日本工会和青年、妇女、宗教、文化等各团体参加国民会议领导的运动，并且以工人的工作场所斗争为中心，在各地区组织群众性的抗议运动。
    会议决定在9月8日举行阻止修改日美“安全条约”第六次全国统一行动时，动员国家公务员和公营企业的各工会一起举行工作场所大会；号召私营公司的工会举行有限期的罢工和工作场所大会，同时在全国各地举行抗议示威游行。当天，在东京的砂川町将举行中央大会。
    面对着日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的轰轰烈烈斗争，岸信介集团正在唆使右翼团体破坏这个关系着日本的和平与独立的运动。今天，东京竟成立了改订日美“安全条约”国民联合会。参加这个法西斯组织的，有前军人四百多人和一批专门从事反动宣传的御用文人。
    新华社6日讯　据东京电台今天广播：阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议将在9月16日召开全国代表会议，以便把阻止修改“安全条约”运动推向新的高潮。
    据报道，参加这次会议的将有来自全国各地的五百多位代表，他们将就加强阻止修改“安全条约”的全国统一行动、目前的形势和加强组织力量等问题进行讨论，并且决定当前的运动方针。
    这家电台说，国民会议认为，岸信介内阁是不会停止修改“安全条约”的，在它修改“安全条约”的企图被制止的时候，也就是它寿终正寝的时候。因此，阻止修改“安全条约”和打倒岸信介内阁是一回事。国民会议为了取得斗争的胜利，应该把群众斗争和国会斗争联系起来。
    这家电台预料，在这次全国代表会议上，国民会议将会强调动员工人进行实力斗争和团结农民以及中小企业者共同进行阻止修改“安全条约”斗争的重要性。
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：全日本学生自治会总联合会中央委员会在今天的会议上决定了行动计划，这个计划强调必须加强阻止修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    行动计划号召日本学生用罢课、游行和群众集会等方式参加定于9月8日举行的阻止修改日美“安全条约”第六次全国统一行动。当9月18日最高裁判所就反对美军基地的“砂川事件”举行的口头辩护结束的时候，这个全国性的学生组织将号召日本学生同工人采取联合行动。
    根据这项计划，“全学联”的会员将在岸信介政府同美国可能签订新的“安全条约”的时候——10月和日本国会可能审议这项条约的时候11月和12月，加强罢课活动，表示他们反对修改“安全条约”的决心。行动计划强调，“全学联”在展开反对修改“安全条约”的斗争时，应该同阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议以及全国各地的其他联合斗争组织进行密切合作。
    “全学联”中央委员会会议是在三天前开幕的。
