Xinhua News Agency, 24th dispatch: London news: The British "Daily Herald" published an article by John Sampson from San Francisco, USA, on the 21st. The article said that the enormous influence generated by Khrushchev's arrival in the United States threw American politicians into incredible panic. They were afraid that "Khrushchev would win hearts and minds and achieve ideological victory," so they continued to spread "Cold War" rhetoric and tried their best to prevent Khrushchev from meeting the American people.

The article wrote that the most foolish thing was that the US Ambassador to the United Nations, Lodge, followed Khrushchev everywhere, promoting the American way of life, trying to weaken the impact of Khrushchev's speeches. "At many social occasions he (Khrushchev) attended, some people tried to provoke Khrushchev, and the questions they asked him were not only provocative but also foolish. We believe that the fanaticism that died with Dulles is still very evident now. Politicians and church leaders condemned this 'America's number one enemy' one after another."

"Some newspapers issued a large amount of hate speech that was even worse than that manufactured by Hitler. The 'New York Daily News' even republished a speech made by an unknown Soviet leader three years ago and warned that Moscow was plotting to undermine the United States."

The article explained how US officials tried every means to prevent Khrushchev from getting close to the American people. It said that Lodge refused Khrushchev's request to take the New York subway on the pretext of "no time." The article wrote: "Khrushchev wanted to get rid of Mr. Lodge, who was always with him, and meet ordinary people, but most attempts were thwarted. All he saw was what he saw from a car traveling at forty or fifty miles per hour, with many motorcycles and escort vehicles on both sides, and submachine guns sticking out of the windows of the escort vehicles."

The article satirized that the "preventive measures" to protect Khrushchev were "so excessive that they were unreasonable. People sometimes wonder who is being protected—is it protecting Khrushchev from contact with the people, or protecting the people from contact with Khrushchev?"

The article emphasized that "government officials are afraid that because Khrushchev has called for complete disarmament at the UN General Assembly, he may achieve a huge propaganda victory over the West." Khrushchev's visit is turning into "a nightmare" for some American politicians.

### 英国“每日先驱报”发表文章指出  赫鲁晓夫访美使华盛顿政客陷入恐慌  美官员故意提挑衅性问题是最愚蠢的事

    英国“每日先驱报”发表文章指出
    赫鲁晓夫访美使华盛顿政客陷入恐慌
    美官员故意提挑衅性问题是最愚蠢的事
    新华社24日讯　伦敦消息：英国“每日先驱报”21日刊载了约翰·桑普森发自美国旧金山的一篇文章。这篇文章说，赫鲁晓夫到达美国以后所产生的巨大影响使美国政客陷入难以置信的恐慌之中。他们害怕“赫鲁晓夫赢得人心和取得思想意识上的胜利”，因此继续散布“冷战”的言论，并且极力阻挠赫鲁晓夫同美国人民见面。
    文章写道，最愚蠢的事莫过于美国驻联合国大使洛奇到处跟着赫鲁晓夫，宣传美国生活方式，企图削弱赫鲁晓夫讲话的影响。“在他（赫鲁晓夫）参加的许多社交场合，总有人企图激怒赫鲁晓夫，对他提出的问题不仅是挑衅性的，而且是愚蠢的。我们认为已经同杜勒斯一起死亡的热狂现在仍然非常显著。政治家和教会领袖们竟相谴责这位‘美国的头号敌人’。”
    “一些报纸发出大量的比希特勒所制造的还要坏的仇恨言论。‘纽约每日新闻’甚至重新发表了某一个不知名的苏联领袖在三年前发表的一篇演说，并警告说，莫斯科正在策划搞垮美国的阴谋。”
    文章说明了美国官员如何千方百计不让赫鲁晓夫同美国人民接近。它说，洛奇以“没有时间”为借口拒绝赫鲁晓夫想乘一下纽约地下电车的要求。文章写道：“赫鲁晓夫想摆脱寸步不离的洛奇先生，去会见普通人民，但大多数试图都受到挫折。他所看到的一直是从时速四、五十英里的汽车上看到的东西，而车的两侧许多摩托车和警卫车，从警卫车的窗口内伸出了手提机关枪。”
    文章讥讽地说，保护赫鲁晓夫的“预防措施是太过分了，以致到了不合道理的程度。人们有时怀疑到底是保护谁——是保护赫鲁晓夫，使他不接触人民呢，还是保护人民，使他们不接触赫鲁晓夫”。
    这篇文章强调说，“（美国）政府人士害怕，由于赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会上要求全面裁军，他可能会对西方取得一次巨大的宣传胜利。”赫鲁晓夫的访问正在变成美国某些政客的“一场恶梦”。
