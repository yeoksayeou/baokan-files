    I Want to Lead My Family in Practicing Diligence and Thrift
    I am a family member of an employee of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and also the deputy director of the street residents' committee. I wholeheartedly support the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the resolution on launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy.
    In 1958, under the leadership of the Party, all aspects of work across the country saw great leaps forward, enabling the four targets of grain, coal, salt, and timber proposed in the Second Five-Year Plan to be completed four years ahead of schedule. This is entirely due to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and it is a victory of the General Line. In the first half of this year, although many regions across the country suffered disasters, our wheat and rapeseed production increased compared to last year. Without the people's communes, there would not have been such great achievements. Now the Party has pointed out that we can catch up with the United Kingdom in the output of major products in about ten years and calls on us to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year, which is really exciting. I am a housewife, 55 years old this year. Although I have not participated in production due to my age, I will also actively respond to the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy, ensuring diligence and thrift in managing the household, and doing a good job in street work to support socialist construction.
    The Party Central Committee calls on us to be diligent and thrifty in managing our households, and I strongly support this. The Party is not asking us to live a hard life, but to live a planned life, with a steady stream of resources, so that we can live even better. From my own past life, I have deeply realized this. My family has five people, with a monthly income of 170 yuan. Although the income is relatively high, we never spend money indiscriminately. Every month, when my son and daughter-in-law receive their wages, we always plan together. First, we set aside fixed expenses such as grain, coal, oil, rent, and utilities. We temporarily set aside money for daily groceries for a few days, and save the rest. We have been saving since 1953. In recent years, although we have encountered several major expenses such as the death of my mother-in-law, my daughter-in-law's miscarriage, and my granddaughter's illness, I have not asked for public assistance, and my family still has savings. Now we have successively saved more than 400 yuan. In recent years, we have also added a lot of things, such as buying a radio. As for myself, in the past, I only hoped to wear a piece of straight-tribute woolen coat in this lifetime. Now, I have sheepskin coats and silk clothes and pants. How beautiful life is!
    The Party also calls on us to save grain, coal, and other consumer goods that are not currently in great demand. Our family has also been paying attention to saving. For example, when eating noodles, I always roll the dough thin and cut it finely, so that it is both delicious and yields more. In terms of coal consumption, I use a honeycomb briquette stove, and when not using the fire, I seal it up, so it only burns one and a half briquettes a day and night, which saves coal for the country and money for myself.
    Recently, because the suburbs have been flooded, the supply of vegetables is relatively small. We never rush to buy them, and we eat whatever we can buy. Because I often pay attention to diligence and thrift in managing the household and arrange life well, my son and daughter-in-law do not have to worry about household affairs and can wholeheartedly do a good job in their work.
    In order to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee to increase production and practice economy, in the future, I will not only arrange my own life well, but also help more than 400 families in our dormitory to live a planned life, pay attention to saving and saving, and I will also mobilize them to actively participate in social activities, strive to study politics and culture, improve their awareness, and respond to various calls from the government. Recently, the government called on us to carry out large-scale sanitation activities to welcome the National Day. I will definitely mobilize all the family members and children of our residents' committee to do a good job in sanitation, so that we can all greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day cleanly and in a happy mood.

### 我要带动家属们勤俭持家

    我要带动家属们勤俭持家
    我是建筑工程部的职工家属，也是街道居民委员会的副主任，我衷心地拥护党的八届八中全会的公报和关于开展增产节约运动的决议。
    1958年全国人民在党的领导下，各项工作都有了很大的跃进，使第二个五年计划提出的粮、煤、盐、木材四项指标，提前四年就完成了，这完全是因为有了党和毛主席的领导，这是总路线的胜利。今年上半年，虽然全国在不少地区都遭了灾，但是我们的小麦、油菜产量都比去年提高了，要不是有了人民公社，那有这么大的成绩。现在党又指出十年左右在主要产品的产量方面就能赶上英国，号召我们提前在今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，真是让人高兴极了。我是一个家庭妇女，今年五十五岁了，虽然因为年纪大没有参加生产，但是我也要积极响应党提出的增产节约的号召，保证勤俭持家，做好街道工作，来支援社会主义建设。
    党中央号召我们要勤俭持家，我非常拥护。党并不是叫我们过苦日子，而是为了叫我们有计划地过日子，细水长流，把日子过得更好。从我自己过去的生活，就深深地体会到这一点，我家共有五口人，每月收入一百七十元，虽然收入比较多，但从不乱花钱。每月当儿子、媳妇领到工资后，我们总是一块计划。首先把粮食、煤、油、房租、水电等固定开支留出来，日用菜钱暂时留出几天的，剩下的就储蓄起来。从1953年起，我们就一直储蓄，这几年虽然遇到我婆婆去世、儿媳妇流产、小孙女生病等几桩大开销，我都没有要公家补助，家里还有积蓄。现在我们又陆续储蓄了四百多元，几年来我们还添置了不少东西，如买了收音机。我自己呢，过去只盼着这辈子穿上一件直贡呢袄，如今，二毛羊皮袄，绸衣绸裤都有了，日子过得多美啊！
    党还号召我们要节约粮食、煤炭和其他目前并不十分需要的消费品。我们家也是一直注意节约的，如吃面条的时候，我总是把面擀薄切细，这样又好吃又出数。在用煤上，我用的是蜂窝煤炉，不用火时就把它封起来，所以一天一夜才烧一块半煤，既给国家节约了煤，自己也省了钱。
    最近因为郊区受了涝灾，蔬菜供应比较少，我们从不去抢购，买着什么就吃什么。因为我经常注意勤俭持家，把日子安排好，所以儿子、媳妇不必为家事操心，能够一心一意地把工作搞好。
    为了响应党中央提出的增产节约号召，今后我不仅要把自己的日子安排好，还要帮助我们宿舍四百多户家属做到过日子有计划，注意节约储蓄，我还要发动她们积极参加社会活动，努力学习政治、文化，提高觉悟，响应政府的各项号召。最近政府号召我们大搞卫生迎接国庆，我一定把我们居民委员会的全体家属和孩子们都发动起来，搞好卫生工作，使我们大家干干净净心情舒畅地来迎接国庆十周年。　	熊忠尧
