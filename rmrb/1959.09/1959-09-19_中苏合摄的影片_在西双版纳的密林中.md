The Sino-Soviet Co-produced Film "In the Dense Forests of Xishuangbanna"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Shi Yu
　　Whether adults or children, whenever they go to the zoo, they never forget to visit those lively and lovable monkeys. However, the life of monkeys in the forest is not familiar to most people. If you go and see "In the Dense Forests of Xishuangbanna," you will gain a lot of interesting knowledge.
　　"In the Dense Forests of Xishuangbanna" is a short popular science film co-produced by the Moscow Science Popular Film Studio of the Soviet Union and the August First Film Studio of China. It shows the wonderful realm of the deep mountains and dense forests of Yunnan to the audience. These dense and sun-遮蔽ed primitive forests are a natural large zoo, ranging from wild elephants and rhinoceroses to finches and squirrels, truly all kinds and everything. This is very attractive to people who like animals. The film delves into the strange animal world, capturing the lives of various animals and their struggle for survival. In the forest, no one can be said to be the ruler, everything is carried out according to the principle of "the strong eat the weak," life here is difficult, and the struggle is cruel. In the film, you can see tigers preying on black deer, crocodiles attacking wild ducks, and mongooses killing cobras.
　　The film mainly records the life of monkeys, which includes both group life and "family life." At first, the little monkeys can only stay in their mother's arms all day long, eating the food handed over by their mother. Later, as they grow up, they begin to look for food themselves, mischievously digging out bird nests in tree holes, and breaking all the bird eggs. But there are also unexpected times: a little monkey just put its paw into a tree hole and suddenly ran away as if it had been electrocuted. It turned out that the hole was not inhabited by a bird, but by a snake! Snakes, pythons, and leopards are the most ferocious enemies of monkeys. When they appear, we can see the mother monkey holding the little monkey tightly in her arms, staring with terrified eyes, and fleeing quickly. However, it is not entirely true to assume that monkeys lack the ability to defend themselves in the face of enemies and can only run away. When a bear attacks, the strong male monkey jumps down to the ground resolutely, fights bravely, and protects his "wife" until he drives the bear away in a panic.
　　People living on the edge of the forest do not like monkeys as much as we do in the zoo, because they often disturb people's lives. The film introduces this situation and arranges an interesting plot: monkeys flock to the fields to break and eat corn. When they are chased by people, another group takes the opportunity to "sneak attack" on people's dining tables, eating and drinking to their heart's content...
　　The film also interestingly records the activities of hunters catching monkeys. The captured monkeys are sent to the zoo, settled down, and gradually accustomed to the new environment, but they still often recall the life of their "hometown." At the end of the film, a close-up shot of a monkey "contemplating" is very lyrical.
　　Watching such a film, one cannot help but deeply thank the photographers. They overcame great difficulties, risked their lives, went deep into the primitive forests rarely visited by people, and worked hard for nearly a year to produce this film for us. In order to shoot some precious fragments, they put in unimaginable labor. For example, there is a set of shots in the film depicting the playfulness and caress between a South China tiger mother and her cubs. It only appears on the screen for two minutes, but in order to shoot it, the photographers set up the camera in an iron fence and waited for thirteen days!
　　Special thanks should be given to the film screenwriter and general director, A.M. Zguridi, who is famous for shooting films of insects, fish, birds, and beasts and has won the Stalin Prize three times, and the chief photographer, N.A. Yurushkina, a Stalin Prize winner, and other Soviet comrades. In the process of working with our photographers, they introduced their rich creative experience to our film artists. We have seen excellent films produced by the Soviet Union such as "On the Arctic Ocean" and "The Story of Penguins" in the past. Now, after learning these valuable experiences, we will definitely produce more interesting popular science films. We welcome and look forward to such films. (Attached pictures)

    中苏合摄的影片“在西双版纳的密林中”
    石鱼
    不论大人或孩子，每逢到动物园玩的时候，总不会忘记去看看那些活泼伶俐、逗人喜爱的猴子。但是森林里的猴子生活，并非一般人都熟悉。如果你去看一下“在西双版纳的密林中”，那就会得到许多有趣的知识。
    “在西双版纳的密林中”是由苏联莫斯科科学普及电影制片厂和我国八一电影制片厂合摄的一部知识小品性的影片，它在观众面前展示了云南深山密林里的奇妙境界。这些密密层层、遮天蔽日的原始森林，是一座天然的大动物园，大自野象、犀牛，小至文鸟、松鼠，真是各色各样，应有尽有。这对于喜欢动物的人，有很大的吸引力。影片深入到奇异的动物世界里，把各种动物的生活和它们争取生存的斗争摄入镜头。在森林中，谁也不能说是统治者，一切都按照着“弱肉强食”的原则进行，这里的生活是艰难的，斗争是残酷的。在影片里可以看到老虎捕食黑鹿、鳄鱼偷袭野鸭，以及食蟹獴击杀眼镜蛇的情形。
    影片以主要篇幅记录了猴子的生活，它们既有群居生活，也有“家庭生活”。起初，小猴子只能整天偎在母猴的怀抱里，吃着从母猴手里接过来的食物。以后，它们长大起来，开始自己寻找食物，顽皮地掏树洞里的鸟窠，把鸟蛋全给弄破了。但也有出乎意料的时候：一只小猴把爪子刚伸进树洞里，忽然像触了电似地逃跑了，原来洞里住的不是鸟，而是一条蛇！蛇、蟒，还有豹子，是猴类最凶恶的敌人，当它们出现时，我们可以看到母猴把小猴紧紧搂在怀里，瞪着惊恐的眼睛，急速逃开。但是如果以为猴子在敌人面前缺乏自卫的能力，只有逃走的份儿，那也并不尽然。当一只狗熊袭来时，健壮的公猴就毅然跳下地来，奋勇抗击，保卫“妻子”，直到把狗熊打得狼狈逃窜为止。
    居住在森林边沿的人们，并不像我们在动物园里那样喜爱猴子，因为它们经常侵扰人们的生活。影片里介绍了这种情况，并且安排了一个有趣的情节：猴子成群结队地窜到田地里掰吃玉米，当遭到人们追击时，另一股却乘机“偷袭”到人们的饭桌上，尽情地吃喝起来……
    影片也有趣地记录了猎人捕捉猴子的活动。捕来的猴子被送到动物园里，安了家，逐渐习惯了新的环境，但仍然时常回忆起“家乡”的生活，影片结尾时拍了一个猴子“沉思”的特写镜头，很富于抒情意味。
    看这样的影片，不能不深深感谢摄影师们。他们克服了巨大的困难，冒着生命的危险，深入人迹罕到的原始森林里，辛苦地工作了将近一年，才为我们摄制出这部影片。为了拍到一些珍贵的片断，他们付出了难以想像的劳动。例如，影片中有一组描写华南虎母子间嬉戏爱抚的镜头，在银幕上出现只不过两分钟，然而为了拍到它，摄影师们在铁栅栏里架好了摄影机，竟然一直等了十三天！
    尤其应该感谢影片编剧兼总导演、以拍摄虫、鱼、鸟、兽影片著称、三次获得斯大林奖金的亚·米·兹古里基和总摄影师、斯大林奖金获得者尼·安·尤鲁什金娜和其他苏联工作同志。他们在和我国摄影师共同工作过程中，把他们丰富的创作经验介绍给我们的电影艺术家。我们过去已看过苏联摄制的“在北冰洋上”、“企鹅的故事”等优秀影片，现在，当我们学习了这些宝贵的经验之后，一定会摄制出更多的有趣的科学小品性的影片。我们欢迎并期待着这样的影片。（附图片）
