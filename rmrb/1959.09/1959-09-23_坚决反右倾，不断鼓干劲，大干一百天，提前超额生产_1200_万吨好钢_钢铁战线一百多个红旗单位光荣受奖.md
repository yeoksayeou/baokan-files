    (Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd) Today, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the National Committee of the China Heavy Industry Trade Union, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station held a National Radio Rally for Steel Production Competition and Appraisal, reviewing the great achievements made by the national iron and steel front in the vigorous production competition movement since this year, and awarding more than 100 red banner units with outstanding production results in the competition movement. This meeting will push the magnificent production competition movement on the national iron and steel industry front to a new climax.
    Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended today's meeting and spoke at the meeting. He listed the great achievements of China's iron and steel industry in continuing the Great Leap Forward since this year, and called on all iron and steel industry workers to complete the plan of 12 million tons of steel, as well as the corresponding pig iron and steel materials, ahead of schedule and with over-production.
    The main venue of today's meeting was located in the music hall of the Central People's Broadcasting Station. Wang Heshou, Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, delivered the opening speech. He said that through this meeting, we will report to the people of the whole country the great achievements made in national steel production and construction; summarize advanced experiences; further carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, push steel production and construction to a new climax, and over-fulfill this year's steel production plan.
    Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also spoke at today's meeting. In his speech, Liu Ningyi called on all workers on the iron and steel front to boost greater revolutionary enthusiasm, overcome all difficulties, and advance victoriously in the decisive fourth quarter, and win a greater victory. Liu Ningyi said that in order to complete this year's steel production tasks ahead of schedule and with over-production, the workers of all enterprises must thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, resolutely criticize and overcome the right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions of some cadres, adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, and extensively and deeply carry out the vigorous movement of increasing production and practicing economy with high output, high quality, and low cost, and further set off a socialist labor competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. In his speech, Hu Yaobang said that I believe that the comrades on the iron and steel front will all show the will of steel and the determination of steel to declare war on right-leaning thoughts. Everyone should be a shock worker in building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Hu Yaobang said that the more the enemy scolds us, the more we must strengthen our ambition and destroy the enemy's prestige; we must constantly boost enthusiasm, constantly strive for the top, and everyone must dare to participate in the great competition. Small blast furnaces dare to compete with large blast furnaces; new workers dare to compete with old workers; and the backward dare to compete with the advanced. Hu Yaobang encouraged the youth collectives and youth comrades who were commended on the iron and steel front to make persistent efforts, create more outstanding achievements, and fight heroically to over-fulfill the glorious task of 12 million tons of steel this year.
    Soviet experts who helped China's ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industry in production and construction were also invited to participate in today's meeting.
    In March of this year, the National Radio Rally for High-Yield and High-Quality Steel Workers' Competition was held in the music hall of the Central People's Broadcasting Station. Since that meeting, the production competition movement on the national iron and steel industry front has been in full swing and has quickly swept across the country. Millions of iron and steel production and construction workers are high-spirited and high-spirited, and have continuously improved the level of steel production. Comparing the first half of September with the first half of March, the national daily steel production level increased by 43.5%, the daily iron production level increased by 29.2%, and the daily steel material production level increased by 31.7%; the quality of steel products has also been significantly improved. In August, the qualification rate of pig iron from small and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide increased by 47% compared with March, and the qualification rate of converter steel nationwide increased by 12% compared with March. The production cost of steel has also been reduced compared with the past. Especially in the past two months, under the encouragement of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the daily steel production level has risen more rapidly, and has repeatedly set the highest daily production records for steel, iron, and steel materials in the country. Today, representatives from steel enterprises in Anshan, Benxi, Dalian, Longyan, Qingdao, Ma'anshan and other places, as well as representatives from the metallurgical departments (bureaus) of Shanghai, Sichuan, and Jiangsu, reported to the conference on the great achievements they have made in production in the past six months, and expressed their lofty aspirations and determination to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule and with over-production, and to win greater victories.
    Yuan Zhen, First Secretary of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Communist Party of China and Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel, said that from January to August this year, Anshan Iron and Steel has made major achievements in production and construction. Since entering September, new people and new things have been increasing day by day, and high-yield records have continued to emerge. In the first ten days of September, the daily production level of steel and iron increased by 13.5% and 6.2% respectively compared with the same period in August. The production levels of coke, ore, refractory materials, transportation, power, machinery and other aspects have also seen new growth. Yuan Zhen said that we must realize the proposal to complete this year's steel production plan ten days ahead of schedule and complete this year's steel material production plan seventeen days ahead of schedule. Xu Yan, Director of the Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau, said that all steel workers in Shanghai resolutely guarantee to complete this year's steel production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule and complete this year's steel material production plan ten days ahead of schedule, and at the same time, complete the production tasks of pig iron, coke, refractory materials, ferroalloys, etc. accordingly with over-production, and compete with Anshan Iron and Steel with this.
    Zhang Guangquan, representative of the Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace of the No. 1 Ironmaking Plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, reported to the conference on the outstanding achievements made by this small blast furnace in the past ten months since its establishment. He said that we overfulfilled the annual production plan on July 19. From September 1st to 10th, the output exceeded the plan by 4%, the qualification rate reached 100%, the coke ratio was 0.723, and the utilization coefficient increased to 2.608. Facts have proved that small blast furnaces can not only produce high yields, but also produce high quality; the construction of small blast furnaces is by no means "not worth the loss", but the gains are extremely great. In the past ten months, the Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace has stood tall under Ma'anshan Mountain, holding high the red flag of high output, high quality, and low cost, and contributing its strength to over-fulfilling the glorious task of 12 million tons of steel. Zhang Guangquan, on behalf of the Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace, proposed to launch a friendly competition with brother blast furnaces across the country. Chen Qingzhou, representative of converter workers at the Qingdao Bicycle Factory, said that in less than a year since we started making steel in a big way last year, we have built small converters from scratch, smelted high-quality steel, rolled various steel materials, and manufactured qualified bicycles. All these achievements prove the complete correctness of the Party's complete set of guidelines for walking on two legs.
    Also speaking at today's radio conference were Luan Degui, furnace chief of the No. 10 open hearth furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel, Zhou Jiahua, Deputy Manager of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Liu Hongxi, furnace chief of the Red Flag Youth Furnace of Dalian Steel Plant and model worker of Luda City, Hu Rukuan, Deputy Mine Manager of Pangjiabao Iron Mine of Longyan Iron and Steel Company, Li Wenda, Deputy Director of the Sichuan Provincial Metallurgical Department, and Ye Yi, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Metallurgical Bureau.
    Then, Liu Bin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, announced the results of the national steel enterprise production competition and appraisal. In the eight production aspects of mines, blast furnaces, open hearth steelmaking, electric furnace steelmaking, ferroalloys, converter steelmaking, steel rolling, coke ovens, and refractory materials, the country selected Dagushan Iron Mine, No. 3 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, No. 1 Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, No. 2 small blast furnace of No. 1 Ironmaking Plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, No. 7 open hearth furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel, Small open hearth furnace of the steel casting workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, No. 1 furnace of Dalian Steel Plant, Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, Steelmaking Workshop of Qingdao Bicycle Factory, No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel, No. 1 and No. 2 Coke Ovens of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, Small Coke Oven of Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Plant, Refractory Material Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and more than 100 red banner units. Amid warm applause, Wang Heshou, Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and Zhao Guoqiang, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Heavy Industry Trade Union, presented award flags to these winning units.
    Today, millions of steel production and construction workers across the country listened to the live broadcast of the conference at the production sites filled with labor enthusiasm. With excitement and joy of victory, they reported the latest production news to the conference by long-distance telephone and telegram. The workers of the No. 1 blast furnace of Baotou Iron and Steel, who are in the tense run-up to production, expressed their determination to learn from the advanced experience of brother ironmaking plants such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and to over-fulfill the state-stipulated pig iron production plan by 30% in the first three months of putting this highly automated large blast furnace into production. All the workers of the five large fixed open hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel guarantee to realize this year's plan to increase steel production by 70,000 tons, and strive to increase steel production by 100,000 tons. The workers of Dalian Steel Plant called the conference by long-distance telephone, saying that they are determined to complete this year's production plan fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule. The workers of Beijing Steel Plant beat gongs and drums and sent a vermilion bulletin with production good news to the conference venue.
