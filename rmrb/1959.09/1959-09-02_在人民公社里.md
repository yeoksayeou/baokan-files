    In the People's Commune
    More Than a Dozen Tractors Have Been Bought

    In 1954, Baiyiqiao Village in the Pengpu area of Shanghai's suburbs was the first to establish an artificial rain station. Now, it has become the Pengpu People's Commune, covering an area of twenty li, with over 11,000 mu of land and vegetable planting accounting for more than 90% of the cultivated land.

    After the advent of artificial rainfall, the farmers here looked forward to tractors replacing heavy manual labor, so that their versatile hands could be used for more sophisticated and complex creative work. Although the advanced agricultural cooperative liberated farmers from the threat of poverty, it did not have the funds to purchase tractors. Before the establishment of the People's Commune in September of last year, the fields were still plied by a few tractors provided by the state for trial use. However, since the merger of eleven advanced cooperatives to form the commune, production has greatly developed and public accumulation has increased. In just ten months, commune members, who had been eagerly awaiting tractors for plowing, were able to use their own tractors, and they added not just one, but fourteen tractors, including one large tractor and thirteen small tractors. Carrying vegetables by shoulder has long been eliminated; most of them are transported by tricycles and large trucks. In the fight against drought, alongside a few creaking waterwheels, there are more water pumps spouting large mouthfuls of water.

      Electric Lights Illuminate a Small Mountain Village
    In Bonzhu, a small mountain village surrounded by mountains north of Suichuan County, Jiangxi Province, people are already living the days of "lighting lamps without oil!"

    Before liberation, the people here lived a very hard life. Poor peasants have always used bamboo strips to light for illumination. When women cook dinner, they often have to hold a bamboo strip fire in one hand and cook with the other, which is very inconvenient; when eating at night, they insert the bamboo strip into the wall cracks, which smokes the whole room and is very unhygienic. After liberation, with the development of production, life has also improved, and ordinary people have lit kerosene lamps. Later, sixteen gas lamps were gradually added.

    After the establishment of the People's Commune last year, with more people and greater strength, and abundant funds, a hydropower station was built and an 18-kilowatt hydroelectric generator was purchased. The whole commune suddenly installed five hundred electric lights. At night, this small mountain village is brightly lit, as bright as day. The masses are very proud to say: "The days of lighting lamps without oil have been realized here."

    "A Garden of a Hundred Flowers"

    On August 17th, the weather was clear. We visited the thousand-mu experimental field jointly managed by the Liuzhuang and Xiaoduli production teams of the Bozhen People's Commune in Jiahe County, Hebei, with curiosity.

    Walking down the Jiaobo Highway, there is the sorghum high-yield experimental field. Bai Shusheng, the team leader, rushed to introduce us: "This is managed by our team, with a total of 52 mu of land, planted with 22 kinds of sorghum such as 'Nine-Headed Bird', 'Dwarf Congee', 'Old Man's Joy', and 'Crooked Neck'." Hearing these names, we all laughed. The "Nine-Headed Bird" is indeed worthy of its name, with nine plants and nine ears on one stump, six to seven feet tall, with dark leaves and thick stalks. The size of the ears are almost the same, just like nine siblings from the same mother. The most eye-catching is the "Crooked Neck," which grows thick and tall, with wide and thick leaves. Strangely, they all have crooked necks, as if staring and tilting their heads to look at people.

    In front of the sorghum high-yield experimental field is the vegetable experimental field. "Yellow-skinned eggplant," "cherry tomato," "chili peppers that grow upwards"... At this time, the old farmer Liu Shude came over and said, "Let's see something new! There are twenty-two kinds of eggplants alone." Following his suggestion, we looked at the "Tongtian Loofah" and the "Long-Striped Cowpea." The smallest "Tongtian Loofah" is four feet long and as thick as a bowl. Eleven "Long-Striped Cowpeas" climbed all over the wooden frame. We curiously measured them again and again, the longest bean was six feet three inches long, and the thickness was similar to a rolling pin. Leaving the vegetable experimental field, there is a large area of corn high-yield experimental field, planted with sixty-eight kinds of corn. Crossing the cornfield is the millet experimental field. In more than 120 mu of millet land, fifty-four varieties are planted. Further south are the experimental fields of sweet potatoes, peanuts, soybeans... This is truly a "garden of a hundred flowers" where all flowers are competing to bloom.

    Leaving the millet field, we climbed onto the central canal. Dense rows of sunflowers grow along the canal and the roadside, swaying in the wind; on the eastern side, there is a green shelterbelt stretching into the distance; on the western side is a large orchard, with golden yellow pears and pearl-like golden thread dates hanging all over the branches... All this before our eyes made it hard for us to believe that a few years ago, this was still a barren land!

    Carp From the Lake Climb the Mountain

    In Dagangshan, in the Xiwei People's Commune, Yishui County, Shandong Province, there is a village of more than a hundred households called Fujiabang. In the past, in the event of a drought, people and animals had to go to the Xiwei River, which was more than four miles away, to fetch water. Last year, a reservoir and a pond were built in the west of the village, storing 32,000 cubic meters of water, reducing the threat of drought; and 60,000 fish fry were brought from Weishan Lake and put into the reservoir. Since then, the people here have started a new career - fish farming.

    "A poor mountain ravine, never even seen shrimp, how can you raise carp!"

    "Never heard of carp from the lake being able to climb the mountain."

    These people did not believe that a high mountain reservoir could raise fish.

    In June of this year, it rained heavily one day. Fifty-six-year-old Grandpa Shuai Dexiu saw an elementary school student catching a carp in the ditch. "It must be that the water in the reservoir is full, and the fish ran out with the water." Thinking of this, Grandpa Shuai quickly picked up two buckets and ran to the reservoir. Sure enough, many small fish ran out of the reservoir, all growing to four or five inches long. He caught the fish that ran out one by one into the bucket, and then carried two buckets of fish to find the party branch secretary. The party branch secretary immediately gathered all the people in the village and held a field meeting around the two buckets of fish. Grasping this fact, he explained that the reservoir could raise fish and praised Grandpa Shuai's collectivist spirit of protecting public property.

    Since then, the people who did not believe that the reservoir could raise fish believed it; the people who did not care about the fish in the reservoir cared about it. Fifty-eight-year-old Granny Zhang Wangshi automatically went to the reservoir to sew shoe soles during the day to prevent the children from catching fish in the reservoir. Commune member Gong Fangdeshun composed a quick verse: "Fujiabang has been short of water for years, and the elders have never tasted fresh fish; since the realization of the People's Commune, carp from the lake have climbed the mountain; life is rich and colorful, and we will never forget the Communist Party."

    在人民公社里
    买来了十多部拖拉机
    1954年上海市郊彭浦地区的白遗桥村子第一个建立了人工降雨站。现在这里已经建立起方圆二十里、拥有一万一千多亩土地、蔬菜种植面积占耕地90％以上的彭浦人民公社了。
    人工降雨出现后，这里的农民就盼望着拖拉机来代替繁重的体力劳动，把那双万般皆能的手，用到更精巧、更复杂的创造性劳动上去。高级社虽然使农民解脱了贫困的威胁，但却没有这笔资金购置拖拉机。在去年9月人民公社成立前，田野上驰骋的，也还是国家支援试用的几部拖拉机。可是，自从十一个高级社合并成立公社后，生产大发展，公共积累增加了，仅十个月的时间，引颈渴望用拖拉机耕地的社员们，便使用上了自己的拖拉机，并且添置的不是一台，而是十四台，其中大拖拉机一台，小拖拉机十三台。运菜用肩挑早已消灭了，大部分都用的是三轮汽车和大卡车；抗旱中，在几部“咿呀咿呀”的水车旁，更多的是吐着大口大口水的抽水机。

      电灯照亮小山庄
    在江西遂川县城北一个群山环抱的小山庄——盆珠，人们已经过着“点灯不用油”的日子了！
    解放前，这里的群众生活很苦，贫农历来是用竹片点火照明。妇女们做晚饭的时候，常常是一手拿竹片火，一手做饭，很不方便；晚上吃饭，就把竹片插在壁缝里，熏得满屋子是烟，很不卫生。解放后，随着生产的发展，生活也有改善，一般群众都点上了煤油灯。后来又逐步添制了十六盏汽灯。
    去年人民公社成立后，人多力量大，资金雄厚，修了水电站，买来了一部十八瓩的水力发电机，全公社一下子安装了五百来盏电灯。夜晚，这个小山庄被照得亮堂堂的，如同白昼一样。群众非常骄傲地说：“点灯不用油的日子，在我们这里实现了。”

    “百花园”
    8月17日，天气晴朗。我们怀着好奇的心情，参观了河北交河县泊镇人民公社刘庄和萧杜李两个生产队联营的千亩试验田。
    走下交泊公路，就是高粱丰产试验田。小队长白树生抢着向我们介绍：“这是俺们小队管理的，共有五十二亩地，种的是
  ‘九头鸟’、‘倭子粥’、‘老头乐’、‘歪脖子’等二十二种高粱。”一听这些名字，我们都笑了。“九头鸟”果真名副其实，一墩九棵九穗，身高六、七尺，叶子黝黑，秸秆粗壮，穗头大小差不多，真像一母九胎的同胞兄妹。最引人注意的是“歪脖子”，它长的又粗又高，叶子既宽也厚，奇怪的是都歪着脖子，好像瞪着眼歪着头在看人。
    在高粱丰产试验田的前边，是蔬菜试验田。“黄皮茄子”、“樱桃西红柿”、“尖朝天长的辣椒”……。这时老农刘树德走来说：“看点新鲜的吧！光茄子就有二十二种。”按着他的建议，我们看了“通天丝瓜”和“长纹大豆角”。“通天丝瓜”最小的有四尺长、碗底粗。十一棵“长纹大豆角”爬满了整个木架子。我们好奇地用尺量了又量，顶长的那个豆角是六尺三寸，粗细和面杖相仿。走出蔬菜试验田，接着是一大片玉米丰产试验田，种了六十八种玉米。穿过玉米地，就是谷子试验田。在一百二十多亩谷子地里，种着五十四个品种。再往南走，就是甘薯、花生、大豆……的试验田。这里真是一个百花争艳的“百花园”。
    出了谷子地，登上了中心渠。渠边、道边长着密密行行的向日葵，迎风摇舞；东面的护市埝上，是一条绿色的防护林带，伸向远方；西面是一大片果树林，金黄色的大鸭梨和珍珠般的金丝小枣，挂满枝头……。眼前这一切景象，简直使我们不能相信，几年前这里还是一片贫瘠的土地啊！

    湖中鲤鱼上山岗
    山东沂水县下位公社大岗山的山腰里，有一个一百多户的村子，叫傅家坊。过去，一遇到干旱，人畜用水都得到来回四里多路的下位河去挑。去年，在村西修建了一座水库和一个池塘，蓄水三万二千公方，减少了干旱的威胁；并且从微山湖弄来六万尾鱼苗，放入库内。从此，这里的人们开始了一项新的事业——养鱼。
    “穷山沟，连虾都没见过，那能养鲤鱼！”
    “没听说湖里的鲤鱼能上山。”
    这些人不相信高山水库能养鱼。
    今年6月间，有一天下大雨。五十六岁的帅德修大爷看见一个小学生在水沟里捉了一条鲤鱼。“一定是水库里的水满了，鱼顺着水跑出来了。”帅大爷想到这里，急忙挑了两个水桶，跑到水库旁边一看，果然不错，水库里跑出不少小鱼，都长到四、五寸长了。他一条一条地把跑出来的小鱼捉进水桶，然后挑着两桶鱼去找党支部书记。党支书随即把全村的人召集起来，围着两桶鱼，开了个现场会。他抓着这个事实，一面说明水库能养鱼，一面表扬了帅大爷爱护公共财产的集体主义精神。
    从此以后，原来不相信水库能养鱼的人相信了；原来不关心水库里的鱼的人关心了。五十八岁的老大娘张王氏，白天自动到水库边纳鞋底，不让孩子们到水库里捉鱼。社员公方德顺口编了一首快板：“历年缺水傅家庄，老辈没有鲜鱼尝；自从实现公社化，湖中鲤鱼上山岗；生活丰富又多采，永远不忘共产党。”
