The People's Liberation Army women's basketball team, which had won all four games since the start of the National Games basketball finals, lost to the Hebei women's team yesterday with a score of 63 to 66.

Yesterday's game was exciting and tense from beginning to end. The Hebei women's basketball team's zone defense and two-center play were exceptionally good, with fast speed and agile movements. Although the People's Liberation Army women's team tried all kinds of tactics, sometimes zone defense, sometimes man-to-man marking, and sometimes full-court press, they still could not thwart the opponent's aggressive offensive and finally lost.

After the start of the game, the Hebei team took the lead with a full-line attack, with Yong Rong and Li Shihua scoring two goals in a row. Chen Xiushan also made a free throw, making it 5-0. The People's Liberation Army team saw that the situation was not good and concentrated its superior forces, densely packed under the basket, intending to control the opponent's two centers. The two centers of the Hebei team, Fu Bin and Yong Rong, also responded to the situation, actively moving on both sides of the basket, widening the opponent's defensive zone, and number 5 Li Shihua took the opportunity to drive straight in, dribbling and scoring four points in a row. Yong Rong and Chen Xiushan also repeatedly cut into the opponent's basket, scoring frequently, reaching 20-12 in one breath, leading by eight points. The People's Liberation Army team saw that the zone defense was not working, switched to man-to-man marking, and actively organized the offense, but the shooting was inaccurate, and even the best shooter Chen Changfeng repeatedly missed. At the end of the first half, the score was 30-21, with the Hebei team leading by nine points.

In the second half, the People's Liberation Army team switched to zone defense again, but still could not suppress the Hebei team's offensive. After about six minutes, the score on the field was 41-25, and the Hebei team had a sixteen-point lead. At this time, Yong Rong, the main center of the Hebei team, committed five fouls and was sent off. The People's Liberation Army team saw that the Hebei team's offensive power was weakened and immediately switched to a full-court press and launched a fast break. Chen Changfeng, Liu Canyun, Xu Min, and Ge Li used both mid-range shots and cut-in shots, chasing the score all the way to 42-42. Before the thunderous applause in the audience had stopped, the Hebei team's sudden counterattack worked. Center Fu Bin cut into the opponent's basket and scored a goal, followed by Chen Xiushan and Fu Bin scoring five points with a combination of shots and free throws. The Hebei team took the lead again by seven points, regaining the advantage. The People's Liberation Army team strengthened its offensive again, making it difficult for the Hebei team to breathe, and the situation of 56-54, 58-56, 60-58, 62-60, and 64-62, with only one point difference, appeared continuously. In the last thirty seconds, the Hebei team got the ball. Seeing that the defeat was imminent, the People's Liberation Army team desperately pressed. Qian Youping fouled, Lu Weihua of the Hebei team missed a free throw, and Li Xiuyun jumped up and put the ball in, making the score 66-62. With nineteen seconds left, Qian Youping of the People's Liberation Army team got the ball and rushed into the opponent's basket. Just as she was about to shoot, Fu Bin of the Hebei team committed her fifth foul. Qian Youping made the first free throw, making the score 66-63. At this time, the People's Liberation Army team replaced two big players, intending to cause the Hebei team to foul again. Qian Youping deliberately missed the second free throw. In the scramble for the rebound, Xing Rongyan of the Hebei team did foul. However, Liu Canyun of the People's Liberation Army team missed the free throw. Just as she was about to attack again, the final buzzer sounded, and the People's Liberation Army women's team finally lost to the Hebei women's team by three points.

    河北女篮胜解放军之战
    作骥　莎荫
    全国运动会篮球决赛开始以来四战四捷的解放军女子篮球队，昨天以六十三比六十六败给河北女队。
    昨天这场球赛从头到尾打得精彩、紧张。河北女篮的区域联防、双中锋打得异常出色，速度快，动作灵巧。解放军女队尽管使尽了各种战术，忽而联防，忽而盯人，忽而又全场紧逼，仍然不能挫折对方咄咄逼人的攻势，终于败北。
    开赛后，河北队先声夺人，全线进攻，雍容、李士华连中两球。陈秀珊又罚进一分，成五比零。解放军队见势不妙，集中优势兵力，密集篮下，意图控制对方的双中锋。河北队的两个中锋傅彬和雍容也随机应变，活跃于篮下两侧，拉大对方的防区，五号李士华乘机长驱直入，带球上篮，连得四分。雍容和陈秀珊也连连切入对方篮下，频频得分，一口气打成二十比十二，领先八分。解放军队见联防不成，改打盯人，并积极组织进攻，可是投篮不准，连最好的投手陈常凤也屡投不中。上半场结果，三十比二十一，河北队领先九分。
    下半场解放军队又改打联防，还是压不住河北队的攻势。约六分钟时，场上比数四十一比二十五，河北队取得了领先十六分的优势。这时，河北队主力中锋雍容五次犯规，被罚下场。解放军队见河北队进攻力量减弱，马上改用全场紧逼，发动快攻。陈常凤、刘灿云、许敏、葛莉中距离投球和切入投球双管齐下，一直追到四十二平。全场雷动的掌声还没有停下，河北队突然反击奏效，中锋傅彬切入对方篮下，投进一球，接着陈秀珊和傅彬连投带罚，夺得五分。河北队又领先七分，夺回了优势。解放军队再一次加强进攻，追得河北队难于喘息，连续出现五十六比五十四、五十八比五十六、六十比五十八、六十二比六十、六十四比六十二只差一球的形势。到最后三十秒，河北队得球，解放军队眼看败局将定，拼命紧逼，钱幽屏犯规，河北队路维华罚球不中，李秀云跃起托入，场上比数六十六比六十二。还有十九秒，解放军队钱幽屏得球，飞步切入对方篮下，正想投篮，河北队傅彬第五次犯规，钱幽屏先罚中一球，成六十六比六十三。这时解放军队换上两个大个子队员，意图造成河北队再次犯规，钱幽屏第二次罚球有意不中，在争夺篮板球时，河北队邢容妍果然犯规。但是解放军队刘灿云罚球不中，正想再次进攻，无奈终场锣响，解放军女队终以三分之差败于河北女队。
