    Millions of Reservoirs Lock Up the Dragon
    Unprecedented Large-Scale Water Conservancy Projects Control Northern Floods and Mitigate Waterlogging
    Central Flood Control Headquarters Issues Flood Control Communiqué for July and August
    Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: The Central Flood Control Headquarters' communiqué on flood control for July and August:

    (1) In July and August this year, the weather on the mainland of China has consistently shown a pattern of drought in the south and flooding in the north. Rainstorms frequently occurred in northern North China, southeastern Inner Mongolia, and southern Northeast China, forming a narrow rain belt that moved from west to east, sometimes from southwest to northeast, with the largest rainstorm center in northern Hebei. The characteristics of the rainfall were: continuous rainfall within this narrow area; each rainfall had an extremely strong rainstorm center. Five major rainstorms occurred this year from July 19th to 22nd, 29th to 30th, August 1st to 6th, 12th to 14th, and 18th. The largest rainstorm was the one from July 19th to 22nd, forming a rain belt from northeast to southwest, with rainfall exceeding one hundred millimeters. The rainstorm center was located upstream of the Jiyun River, midstream of the Luan River, and near Shanhaiguan, with the central rainfall exceeding four hundred millimeters. Xinji in Jixian County recorded a daily rainfall of five hundred and forty-three millimeters. The rainstorm from August 1st to 6th also had rainfall exceeding one hundred millimeters, with the rainstorm center in the downstream of the Daqing River and Yongding River, with the central rainfall exceeding two hundred millimeters. Quzhuang Reservoir in Tangxian County received four hundred and seventeen millimeters in five hours, which is rare in history. The central rainfall of the other three rainstorms all exceeded one hundred millimeters. The cumulative rainfall in the Beijing area in July and August was one thousand and sixty-six millimeters, more than four hundred millimeters more than the average annual rainfall. The rainfall on July 30th was two hundred and forty millimeters in less than eight hours, the highest record in eighty years.
    In these rainy areas, floods occurred one after another. The Luan River flood peak occurred in late July, the Jiyun River experienced flood peaks in late July and early and mid-August, the Xiliao River experienced flood peaks in early July and early and mid-August, the Chaobai River experienced three major flood peaks on July 19th, August 4th, and 7th, and the upper reaches of the Yongding River also experienced a major flood peak on July 31st. The north and south branches of the Daqing River both experienced flood peaks on August 7th. The Tongguan station on the Yellow River experienced four flood peaks exceeding ten thousand cubic meters per second in July and August.
    Three typhoons struck the mainland of China in July and August this year: the first one swept across the southeastern coast of China on July 16th, the second one landed in Xiamen, Fujian Province on August 23rd, causing strong winds and rainstorm disasters in the Xiamen area, and the third one landed in Quanzhou, Fujian on August 30th, passed through northeastern Jiangxi and southeastern Anhui, and moved out of the mainland from a place slightly north of the Yangtze River estuary on the morning of September 1st.

    (2) This year's floods posed a serious threat to agricultural production, as well as the safety of villages, towns, cities, and transportation in the affected areas. If it were not for the large number of large, medium, and small-scale projects built over the years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the historical situation of rampant floods would have been repeated. However, due to the significant role played by water conservancy projects, coupled with the flood control efforts of the people, the floods were effectively controlled, and a great victory was achieved in the flood control struggle.
    Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, and the Beijing area had a total of four hundred and thirty-nine large, medium, and small-scale reservoir projects built before 1957, including the Guanting Reservoir. From July 1st, they impounded a total of 4.763 billion cubic meters of floodwater during the flood season. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, twenty-one large-scale reservoir projects have been completed or are under construction, including the Miyun jointly built by Beijing and Hebei, and the Gangnan, Huangbizhuang, Wangkuai, Xidayang, Hengshanling built by Hebei Province, and the Qinghe built by Liaoning Province, seven huge valley reservoirs in all, which impounded a total of 4.314 billion cubic meters of floodwater during the flood season; fifteen thousand and ninety-eight medium and small-scale reservoirs have been completed or are under construction, impounding 2.618 billion cubic meters of floodwater during the flood season. In total, large, medium, and small-scale projects impounded 11.695 billion cubic meters of floodwater this flood season, of which the new projects built since the Great Leap Forward stored 6.932 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 1.45 times the water storage capacity of the old projects before the Great Leap Forward. If only the flood season storage capacity of large, medium, and small-scale reservoirs in mountainous areas is calculated, excluding reservoirs in depressions and plains, the flood season storage capacity of reservoirs built since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 is approximately 4.8 times the storage capacity before the Great Leap Forward.

    Due to the impoundment of floodwater by large, medium, and small reservoirs, the flood peaks downstream of the reservoirs were greatly reduced. Many small and medium-sized rivers have eliminated flood disasters due to the construction of small and medium-sized reservoirs. Taking the Douhe Reservoir near Tangshan City, Hebei Province, as an example, the inflow flood peak this year was 1,670 cubic meters per second. After being impounded by the reservoir, the outflow was 120 cubic meters per second. The water did not leave the river channel, ensuring the safety of Tangshan City. It also stored 73 million cubic meters of water, which can supply industrial water for Tangshan City. In 1949, the Douhe flood peak was 1,165 cubic meters per second, and the flood invaded the urban area of Tangshan, causing industrial and mining production to stop, with a loss of 7.1 million yuan. Due to the increase in industrial output value in recent years, if the 1949 flood were to occur again this year, the estimated loss would reach 13 million yuan. The loss avoided by the Douhe Reservoir this year has offset its construction cost. The Puhe Reservoir in Xushui County and the Honglingjin Reservoir in Xinle County completely blocked the floods of the Puhe and Quhe Rivers; the flood peak flow of the Longmen Reservoir on the Caohe River in Yixian County reached 500 cubic meters per second, and the outflow was only 50 cubic meters per second. These reservoirs not only ensured the safety of downstream farmland and villages but also ensured the safety of railway transportation.

    On the basis of water storage in medium and small projects, large reservoirs effectively controlled the floods of large rivers. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the large-scale valley reservoirs built by Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality to fundamentally control the Haihe River have played a very significant role in flood control, effectively controlling this Haihe River flood. On the major tributaries of the Haihe River where large reservoirs have been built: the Miyun Reservoir reduced the flood peak flow of the Chaobai River from 3,100 cubic meters per second to 400 cubic meters per second; the Guanting Reservoir reduced the flood peak flow of the Yongding River from 3,700 cubic meters per second to 627 cubic meters per second; the Wangkuai Reservoir reduced the Shahe River, the south branch of the Daqing River, from 6,000 cubic meters per second to 4,000 cubic meters per second; the Xidayang Reservoir reduced the Tanghe River from 2,480 cubic meters per second to 310 cubic meters per second; the Hengshanling Reservoir reduced the Cihe River from 1,100 cubic meters per second to 180 cubic meters per second; the Gangnan and Huangbizhuang Reservoirs reduced the Hutuo River from 3,000 cubic meters per second to 866 cubic meters per second. After the flood peaks were reduced on the above tributaries, the flood situation in the Baiyangdian, Dongdian, and other depressions in the downstream of the Haihe River basin and the downstream of the North Canal was relatively stable. Under the strict protection of the people in various places, the safety of the main embankments was ensured, guaranteeing the safety of the vast farmland, cities, and transportation in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding areas, and greatly reducing the situation of waterlogging.

    On the Yellow River, the Sanmenxia Reservoir, which is under construction, has reduced flood peaks four times, reducing the flood control burden downstream.
    The quality of the water conservancy projects built in the past, especially the large number of projects built since the Great Leap Forward last year, is good, and the vast majority have successfully passed the test of floods. Among the 15,098 medium and small reservoirs built since the Great Leap Forward, only 486 have experienced accidents of varying degrees, including 17 medium-sized and 469 small-sized. The main lessons learned from the accidents are insufficient estimation of rainstorm intensity, small reservoir capacity, and small overflow section of spillways.

    The floods on the Luan River, Jiyun River, Daling River, and other rivers without control reservoir projects were very large, causing certain disasters downstream. In the areas where the rainstorm center was located, waterlogging was more serious. In total, approximately 20 million mu of farmland in Hebei, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and the Beijing urban area were flooded, and the Beijing-Shenyang and Beijing-Guangzhou railways were once interrupted. The rainfall situation in northern and central Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality this year is similar to that in 1949, and the rainstorm intensity in the rainstorm center area is even greater than in 1949. This year, due to the impoundment of 8.9 billion cubic meters of floodwater by large, medium, and small reservoirs, the situation of rampant floods in 1949 has been fundamentally changed, with 12 million mu less land flooded than in 1949, and the disaster situation is greatly reduced compared to 1949. This is a great victory for the people of Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality in fundamentally controlling the Haihe River.

    (3) The victory of this year's flood control struggle is a victory for the General Line, a victory for the Great Leap Forward, and a victory for the People's Communes. If it were not for the hundreds of millions of peasants under the leadership of the Party, inspired by the General Line, launching an unprecedented large-scale water conservancy construction, greatly breaking through the past construction speed, the conditions for preventing and controlling floods like this year would be unimaginable. In the nine years after liberation, the people of Hebei built two large reservoirs, Guanting and Douhe. The earthwork volume of the Guanting Dam is approximately one million cubic meters, and Douhe is approximately 2.79 million cubic meters. However, after the Great Leap Forward, relying on the great strength of the people, six large reservoirs, Miyun, Gangnan, Huangbizhuang, Wangkuai, Xidayang, and Hengshanling, were able to control floods within one year and be completed in two years. The earthwork volume of each dam is: Miyun, 20.56 million cubic meters; Gangnan, 10.33 million cubic meters; Huangbizhuang, 5.13 million cubic meters; Xidayang, 6.7 million cubic meters; Wangkuai, 6.03 million cubic meters; Hengshanling, 2.31 million cubic meters. This is a speed rarely seen in the world. Without the General Line, without the Great Leap Forward, without the People's Communes, is this imaginable? Millions of people, from the victory of the flood control struggle, cheer Long Live the General Line! Long Live the Great Leap Forward! Long Live the People's Communes!

    总路线　大跃进和人民公社的赫赫功勋
    千百万座水库锁住蛟龙
    史无前例的大规模水利工程控制了北方洪水减轻了涝灾
    中央防汛总指挥部发表  七、八月份的防汛公报
    新华社5日讯　中央防汛总指挥部关于7、8月份的防汛公报
    （一）今年7、8两月，我国大陆上的天气一直持续着南旱北涝的形势。暴雨经常出现在华北北部、内蒙古东南部及东北南部，形成一条狭长雨带，一次又一次地从西向东移动，有时自西南向东北移动，最大的暴雨中心在河北北部。降雨的特点是：在这条狭长地区内不断降雨；每次降雨都有极为强烈的暴雨中心。今年7月19日至22日、29日至30日、8月1日至6日、12日至14日、18日共发生了五次大暴雨，其中以7月19日至22日一次暴雨最大，形成一条东北西南向的暴雨带，雨量在一百毫米以上，暴雨中心在蓟运河上游、滦河中游及山海关附近，中心雨量则超过四百毫米，蓟县辛集日雨量五百四十三毫米。8月1日至6日一次暴雨，雨量也有一百毫米以上，暴雨中心在大清河及永定河下游，中心雨量在二百毫米以上，唐县曲庄水库五小时内就下了四百一十七毫米，为历年少见。其余三次暴雨中心雨量都在一百毫米以上。北京地区7、8两月累积雨量一千零六十六毫米，比常年年雨量还多四百多毫米，7月30日不到八小时降雨二百四十毫米，为八十年来最高记录。
    在这些多雨地区，洪水接连不断发生。滦河洪峰发生在7月下旬，蓟运河7月下旬和8月上、中旬各一次，西辽河7月上旬和8月上、中旬各一次，潮白河在7月19日、8月4日、7日发生较大洪峰三次，永定河上游7月31日也发生一次较大洪峰，大清河南、北支都在8月7日发生洪峰。黄河潼关站7、8月内发生一万秒立方米以上的洪峰共四次。
    今年7、8月侵袭我国大陆的台风有三次：第一次于7月16日掠过我国东南沿海，第二次于8月23日在福建省厦门登陆，造成厦门附近地区大风暴雨灾害，第三次于8月30日在福建泉州一线登陆，经过江西东北部，安徽东南部，9月1日晨从长江口稍北地方移出大陆。
    （二）今年的洪水对有关地区的农业生产以及村镇、城市、交通的安全都是严重的威胁。如果没有历年来特别是大跃进以来所修的大量大、中、小型工程，历史上洪水横流的局面将要重演。但是由于水利工程发挥了重大作用，加上人民的防汛努力，洪水受到有力的控制，防汛斗争取得巨大胜利。
    河北、内蒙古、辽宁和北京市地区在1957年以前所兴建的大、中、小型水库工程共四百三十九座，其中包括官厅水库，从7月1日起，汛期共拦蓄洪水四十七点六三亿立米。1958年大跃进以来已经建成和正在施工的大型水库工程就有二十一座，其中包括北京市、河北省合办的密云、河北省举办的岗南、黄壁庄、王快、西大洋、横山岭和辽宁省举办的清河等七座规模巨大的山谷水库，汛期共拦蓄洪水四十三点一四亿立米；已经建成和正在施工的中、小型水库有一万五千零九十八座，汛期拦蓄洪水二十六点一八亿立米。总计今年汛期大、中、小型工程共拦蓄洪水一百一十六点九五亿立米，其中大跃进以来所修的新工程蓄水达六十九点三二亿立米，相当于大跃进以前老工程蓄水量的一点四五倍。如仅就山区大、中、小型水库汛期蓄水量来计算，不包括洼淀平原水库在内，则1958年大跃进以来所修水库工程，汛期蓄水量约为大跃进以前蓄水量的四点八倍。
    由于大、中、小水库拦蓄洪水，大大削减了水库下游的洪峰。不少中小河流由于修建了中小水库，消除了洪水灾害。以河北省唐山市附近的陡河水库为例，今年入库洪峰流量为一千六百七十秒立米，经水库拦蓄后，下泄流量一百二十秒立米，水不出河槽，确保了唐山市的安全，还蓄水七千三百万立米，可以供给唐山市的工业用水。1949年陡河洪峰流量一千一百六十五秒立米，洪水侵入唐山市区，工矿停止生产，损失七百一十万元。由于近年来工业产值上升，如今年再遇1949年洪水，估计损失将达一千三百万元，陡河水库今年免除的损失已抵偿了它的造价。河北省徐水县瀑河水库和新乐县红领巾水库将瀑河和曲河的洪水全部拦蓄；河北省易县漕河上的龙门水库洪峰流量达五百秒立米，下泄流量仅五十秒立米，这些水库不仅保证了下游农田村庄的安全，也保证了铁路交通的安全。
    在中、小工程蓄水的基础上，大型水库有效控制了大河的洪水。1958年大跃进以来，河北省和北京市为根治海河修建的大型山谷水库起了极为显著的拦洪作用，有效地控制了此次海河的洪水。在修建大型水库的海河各大支流上：密云水库使潮白河的洪峰流量从三千一百秒立米减为四百秒立米；官厅水库使永定河的洪峰流量从三千七百秒立米减为六百二十七秒立米；王快水库使大清河南支沙河从六千秒立米减为四千秒立米；西大洋水库使唐河从二千四百八十秒立米减为三百一十秒立米；横山岭水库使磁河从一千一百秒立米减为一百八十秒立米；岗南和黄壁庄水库使滹沱河从三千秒立米减为八百六十六秒立米。在以上支流削减洪峰后，海河流域下游白洋淀、东淀等洼淀和北运河下游的汛情都较平稳，在各地人民严密防护下，确保了各主要堤防的安全，保证了京、津、保地区广大农田和城市、交通的安全，并且大大减轻了涝灾的情况。
    在黄河上，正在施工的三门峡水库曾四次削减了洪峰，减轻了下游的防汛负担。
    过去所修的特别是去年大跃进以来所大量兴修的水利工程的质量是好的，绝大多数胜利经过了洪水考验。在大跃进以来所修的一万五千零九十八座中、小水库中，只有四百八十六座发生过不同程度的事故，其中中型十七座，小型四百六十九座。事故的主要教训是对暴雨强度估计不足，水库库容过小，溢洪道开挖断面过小。
    在未修建控制水库工程的滦河、蓟运河、大凌河等河流上的洪水都很大，在下游造成一定灾害。在暴雨中心所在的地区，积水为害较严重。总计河北、辽宁、内蒙古及北京市区受淹农田共约二千万亩左右，并曾使京沈、京广铁路一度中断。今年河北省北部、中部及北京市的雨情和1949年相仿，暴雨中心地区的暴雨强度比1949年还要大，今年由于大、中、小水库共拦蓄洪水八十九亿方，基本上改变了1949年洪水横流的局面，比1949年少淹地一千二百万亩，灾情比1949年大大减轻，这是河北省和北京市人民根治海河的伟大胜利。
    （三）今年防汛斗争的胜利，是总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利，人民公社的胜利。如果不是几亿农民在党的领导下，在总路线的鼓舞下，展开史无前例的大规模的水利建设，大大突破了过去的建设速度，今年这样防治水灾的条件是不可能想像的。在解放以后的九年中，河北人民建成了官厅和陡河两座大型水库，官厅大坝的土方量约为一百万方，陡河约为二百七十九万方。但是在大跃进以后，依靠人民的伟大力量，一年内就使密云、岗南、黄壁庄、王快、西大洋、横山岭等六个大型水库拦洪，两年就可建成。各坝的土方量：密云，二千零五十六万方，岗南一千零三十三万方，黄壁庄五百一十三万方，西大洋六百七十万方，王快六百零三万方，横山岭二百三十一万方。这是世界少有的速度。没有总路线，没有大跃进，没有人民公社，这是可以想像的吗？千万人民从防汛斗争的胜利中，欢呼总路线万岁！大跃进万岁！人民公社万岁！
