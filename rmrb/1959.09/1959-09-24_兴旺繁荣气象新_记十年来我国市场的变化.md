    A Thriving and Prosperous New Atmosphere
    —Remembering Ten Years of Changes in China's Market
    Xinhua News Agency Reporters Hai Lan and Ye Shitao
    In just ten years, China's new socialist market has grown and expanded with the development of national economic construction and the victory of socialist transformation.
    In these ten years, China's market has undergone earth-shaking changes. All kinds of evils of the old capitalist market have been eradicated. In the old market, speculative merchants stirred up trouble, causing serious damage and harm to production and people's lives; in the new market, socialist commerce does everything possible to support production development and wholeheartedly serves consumers. Today, the market is thriving and healthy. Through the mirror of the market, we see the rapid leaps and bounds of the country's industrial and agricultural production and the scenes of people's happy and beautiful lives.
            Controlling the Turbulent Prices
    Price is a barometer of a country's economic situation. People still remember that ten years ago, when the motherland was just liberated and the people of the whole country were jubilantly celebrating the new life, the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries hoped to stir up a reverse wave of price fluctuations in our liberated territory. They viciously cursed: The Chinese Communist Party can only win militarily and cannot revive the paralyzed market. The expelled imperialist elements said coldly: "Price fluctuations are enough to bring down the people's regime." Domestic commercial speculators waved their long sleeves and said, "The Communist Party has no way to stop price fluctuations." The landlords buried their fat bodies in bamboo chairs and said, "If you want something, bring silver dollars."
    But history is so merciless! Curses are always so ridiculous! Ten years have passed, and the Chinese Communist Party has controlled price fluctuations that have never been controlled in history. This was a sharp and arduous struggle. In the early days of liberation, the state dumped a large amount of materials on the market, strengthened financial management, launched a struggle against silver dollar and gold note speculation by the whole people, unified the national financial economy, and defeated the price fluctuations stirred up by speculators taking advantage of the country's unbalanced financial revenue and expenditure and the unstable foothold of the state-owned economy, so that prices that had been turbulent for many years tended to stabilize.
    For nearly ten years since March 1950, national prices have remained stable. Even when some commodities were once in short supply on the market, prices remained so stable. According to the materials of the State Statistical Bureau, if the retail price index of China's eight major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin is 100 in March 1950, then it was only 101.4% in 1958. In Shanghai, in March 1950, one yuan of Renminbi (calculated in new currency) could buy 5.2 jin of medium white japonica rice or 33.4 jin of coal briquettes, or 2.1 chi of No. 90 Shilin blue cloth, or 4.3 pieces of Guben soap; and today, one yuan of Renminbi can completely buy the same amount of goods, and some can even buy more. Such stable prices could not be achieved by any ruling class in old China, nor could they be achieved by any capitalist society.
    Today, the older generation still has lingering fears when mentioning the soaring prices during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Opening the old newspapers from ten years ago, almost all you see is rise! rise! rise!
    —The rising wind is猛ly hitting Beijing and Shanghai, the market is in chaos, and people are in panic! (Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, June 27, 1948)
      —In last week's gold storm, gold notes rose one and a half times, and Yuan Datou took the lead, rising two times! (Shanghai Financial Daily, April 11, 1949)
      —The rising wind狂ly hits the Guangzhou market, and citizens change color when they talk about "prices"! (Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, November 7, 1948)
    —Prices are soaring, the elderly have no one to support them, and they commit suicide. (Beijing World Daily)
    How many times did prices rise at that time? According to historical data, from June 1937 to August 1948, before the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionaries, prices rose a total of six million times in eleven years. What a terrible astronomical figure! How many human tragedies are contained in this number!
    From the price index and price statistics of the former Shanghai Municipal Government Social Bureau and the former Chongqing Municipal Government, we can see how serious the soaring prices were during the Kuomintang rule, and how deep the plunder, extortion, and oppression suffered by the people were! We can use the purchasing power of one hundred yuan of pseudo-legal tender to compile the following formula:
    1937…………Two oxen
    1939…………One pig
    1941…………One bag of flour
    1943…………One chicken
    1945…………Two eggs
    1946…………1/6 of a bar of soap
    1947…………One coal briquette
    1949…………2.45 ten-thousandths of a grain of rice
    Qiao Guizhai, an old man in his eighties in Jinsha City, Guizhou Province, still keeps a very precious old account book. It records the accounts for thirty-eight years. This is neither Qiao's family income and expenditure account nor a commodity transaction account, but the price of grain, coal... in each period. According to this old man, grain prices in the old society jumped day and night. Poor people were most afraid of grain price increases. Once grain took the lead, everything else followed. He specially wrote it down to see when it would reach the end.
    The old man's account stopped in 1950. Is the old man lacking perseverance? No. Because "from then on, the grain price was the same every day, and there was no need to record it." The old man said happily, if you want to record it, you might as well engrave a "same as above" seal and stamp it on it every day!
          Industry, Agriculture and Commerce Join Hands to Busy Production
    Opening the lid of the old market, the inside is full of darkness, full of speculation, fraud, and exploitation...
    In Shanghai and Tianjin, there were a large number of speculators who did all kinds of evil. Among them were imperialist elements, bureaucratic compradors, and speculative merchants. Their speculative methods were all kinds of strange things. There was the so-called "kicking the ball". A commodity stack list could be thrown around like a ball between dozens of speculative merchants. It was traded dozens of times, and dozens of "transfer" stamps were stamped on the back of the stack list. In fact, they didn't even see the goods, but they made a lot of money between resales. In the speculative market, commodities were no longer commodities, and even less about use value, but chips for them to pursue huge profits and speculate. At that time, some "snatching hat" speculative merchants mixed in the turbulent waves of sharp rises and falls in stock, gold note, and commodity prices. Most speculative transactions, the seller had no goods, and the buyer had no currency, everything was carried out by buying empty and selling empty.
    In the old market with turbulent speculation, industry and commerce competed for profits and competed in the market. Speculative commerce brought unparalleled disasters to legitimate industrial production. Factory products could not be sold, and even if they were sold, the proceeds could not be used to replenish the same amount of raw materials due to soaring prices, and production was dying. Please see a passage from the former "Shanghai Industrial Association" in a confession to the "National Government" on May 11, 1949: "At present, the export of industrial finished products in this city has tended to stagnate... Funds have been exhausted, and there is really no way out...." Shanghai was like this, and the national industry in other cities was no different. Many industrial capitalists saw that hoarding and speculation were profitable, so they abandoned industry for commerce, and even "hoarded" and "invested," putting production out of their minds.
    Today, speculators and "adventurers" have long been driven out of the market by the people, and the capitalist industry and commerce that bred them have also embarked on the bright road of socialism. Since liberation, the Party and the state have adopted the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and gradually carried out socialist transformation through state capitalist forms such as processing, ordering, distribution, and agency sales. By 1956, a high tide of joint state-private ownership of the whole industry appeared across the country, and the historical task of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country was basically completed. The national market has since become a unified socialist market.
    From the first day of its establishment, socialist commerce took promoting industrial production as its most important task. Under the socialist system, the industrial and commercial departments have the same goals, the same interests, mutual cooperation, and mutual promotion. Over the past ten years, commercial departments have actively purchased and promoted factory products. In 1958, the industrial products purchased by the Shanghai commercial department increased fourteen times compared with 1950. Now, almost every day, industrial products worth more than 20 million yuan pour into the warehouses and goods yards of state-owned commerce. Factory products are put into the circulation field as soon as they are produced. What a strong contrast this makes with the dismal scene of factory products not being sold and raw materials not being replenished before liberation!
    Not only that, the vast number of commercial personnel also go deep into factories, tap potential, act as assistants, cooperate with industrial departments to solve raw material difficulties; offer ideas, act as consultants, assist industrial departments to comprehensively arrange production; find materials, supply equipment, and support factories to make a big technical revolution. The "Securities Building," the financial speculation center of Shanghai, is now the procurement and supply station of state-owned hardware machinery and transportation electrical equipment. This place used to be a well-known speculation "headquarters," and now it is a logistics department that supports industrial production and arranges market supply. Because they actively support industrial production, the hardware and electrical products supplied to various places every year account for about half of the national total supply.
    State-owned commerce also makes every effort to support and help agriculture.
    Every year during the spring ploughing season, commercial personnel carry funds and materials to the countryside to guide farmers to arrange production according to the national plan, sign contracts for the purchase and sale of agricultural products with farmers, and help solve production difficulties. Every year, the state-owned commercial department distributes more than 1 billion yuan of advance purchase deposits for agricultural products. These deposits are interest-free and are purchased at the price stipulated by the state at the time of the autumn harvest. The result of the state's support and promotion of agricultural production in all aspects has made the state-owned commercial department's procurement volume larger and larger, and the lives of farmers are getting better and better. In 1958, the national purchase of grain, cotton, oil, flue-cured tobacco, tea and other products increased from one to six times compared with 1952; in 1957, the income of farmers from the sale of agricultural and sideline products exceeded half of 1952.
    The relationship between town and country in old China, in which cities plundered and exploited the countryside, is gone forever. Today, cities and villages, workers and peasants support each other closely and cooperate with each other. The countryside provides the city with a large amount of grain and industrial raw materials such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco. The means of production and daily necessities manufactured in cities also flow to the countryside. When ploughing in the spring, tractors and double-wheeled double-share ploughs are sent; during the autumn harvest, harvesters and threshers are sent; chemical fertilizers are used for fertilization; pumping machines are used for drainage and drought resistance; and various pesticides and agricultural machinery are used for insect pests. In the past ten years, the national supply of drainage and irrigation machinery, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, etc. has increased dozens of times. In industrial cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, day and night, every day, cars and ships full of daily necessities such as calico, underwear, rubber shoes, and bicycles are sent to the countryside. Commercial personnel went deep into farmers' homes to understand farmers' hobbies and designed many new products based on their opinions. Calico printed with peacock spreading wings and one hundred sons, fully-opening health shirts, short and fat bamboo shell hot water bottles... have been selling well in rural areas.
    Two societies, two kinds of commerce, two attitudes towards industry and agriculture, are clearly distinct. Who destroys production and who promotes production, people will draw conclusions.
            Deep Friendship Inside and Outside the Counter
    The old market was a "paradise" for speculative merchants, while the working people regarded it as a dangerous road. People went to the store to buy things, no matter how careful and vigilant they were, they would still be deceived and suffer losses under the capitalist's set of coaxing, deceiving, cheating methods.
    Older people still remember that when they came to the streets of the city and the markets of the countryside, there was almost a noisy hawking sound. Some stores shamelessly promoted how good their products were, and clearly local earth-woven socks were said to be the famous "Mojuju brand" in Shanghai; some stores hung a big signboard of "genuine goods at fair prices, no second price," but as long as customers ran two more stores, the Western mirror was immediately torn down. Cotton cloth stores attracted business with "add three feet and release feet," but in fact, their feet were particularly short, and they also had special methods when measuring cloth. When customers went home to re-measure, one foot was still one foot. Many stores also had so-called "hook-up products," selecting a few small commodities and slightly reducing prices, and advertising them vigorously. Unsuspecting customers were hooked, buying one cheap item, but eating a few "tiger meat." Even worse was a kind of "tiger stall" that specializes in deceiving honest people. They first scare customers away with lies, and then coax customers back with sweet words. If they don't buy, they threaten, curse, and force a deal. In their jargon, it's called "no deal without beating or scolding."
    Capitalist commerce is cheating customers and exploiting the working people in this way.
    The socialist market appeared in front of people with a new attitude, especially since the great leap forward on the commercial front in 1958, the market in our country has been full of vitality. The "no second price, no deception of the old and young" that people have dreamed of for many years has become a reality.
    "Doing everything possible to serve customers" has become the action guide for salespersons. Today, in stores, commodities and currency can no longer be regarded as the only things between customers and salespersons. Although they are still in contact through exchange, the relationship between salespersons and customers is no longer an ordinary buying and selling relationship, but relatives and friends with deep affection.
    In Shanghai, in order for a passing traveler to buy her favorite Golden Rooster brand canned biscuits, one salesperson after another, one store after another, looked for her everywhere, and finally satisfied the customer's request.
    In Harbin, a salesperson in a department store found that a customer had bought a stained pair of trousers in a hurry, and quickly chased her back and replaced them with good ones.
    In stores, people can also see many things that have nothing to do with buying and selling. Salespersons in shoe stores sew torn leather shoes for customers free of charge; salespersons in grain stores help nearby residents improve cooking methods and save grain; female salespersons in department stores take the initiative to knit wool socks for single customers in their spare time... Can these be included in the scope of commodity transactions? And these things happen frequently in stores all over the motherland today.
    State-owned commerce shoulders the glorious task of "managing the family." Commercial personnel must not only serve customers well, but also try their best to let people buy satisfactory things. In order to meet the needs of people's ever-improving lives, thousands of purchasing agents travel tirelessly to organize sources of goods. The purchasing agents who transfer non-staple food are even more tireless, and even risk their lives, running around the rivers, seas, and fields, and traveling all over the mountains, forests, and grasslands, forgetting to eat and sleep, and eating and drinking in the wind and dew. The purchasing agents in the southwest押 the cattle群 over the Yun-Gui mountains; the purchasing agents in Anhui赶 the ducks across the turbulent Yangtze River. For the needs of the people, the commercial department must not only operate enough "mass goods", but also supply many sporadic, special small commodities and high-end commodities, not only operate complete sets of goods, but also supply small parts and accessories.
              More and More Prosperous
    Today, the market in our country is full of prosperity. Whether in big cities or rural areas, shops or supply and marketing cooperatives, they are all full of customers. The Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Department Store receives nearly 100,000 customers every day, and even 200,000 to 300,000 on weekends and holidays. The store completes about 40,000 transactions every day. Based on last year's turnover, an average of one transaction of 4.6 yuan was made every second. At stations and docks, materials come and go from the south to the north, into the city and down to the countryside, which is very busy.
    In the past ten years, although the supply of daily necessities by state-owned commercial departments has increased year by year, it is still far from meeting the needs. In 1958, the total retail sales of social commodities nationwide increased by more than two times compared with 1950, and the first seven months of this year increased by more than 20% compared with the same period last year. Such rapid growth is unprecedented in the history of our country.
    The huge purchasing power that has emerged after the universal improvement of the lives of 650 million people is the source of the prosperity of the socialist market in our country. Today, the Chinese people have not only got rid of the bitter days of "working all year round and not getting enough to eat" and "hoping for a good year next year, but still wearing a broken cotton coat next year" before liberation, but also after solving the fundamental problems of eating, clothing, housing, etc., their lives are getting better and better. The highest aspirations of workers and peasants are no longer the seven things to open the door: firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea, but dozens or hundreds of things. They need enamel washbasins, flashlights, gold pens, thermos bottles, blankets, flannel clothes, bicycles, and even some things that they never dared to think of in the past, such as woolen cloth, silk, watches, radios, and sewing machines, have now become not very rare family property in their families. In the past ten years, the sales volume of these commodities has increased several times.
    Some people ask, how much has the life of Chinese workers and peasants improved since liberation? According to the materials of the State Statistical Bureau, compared with 1958 and 1952, the purchasing power of employees across the country has increased by one and a half times, and the purchasing power of farmers has increased by about 70%.
    Being used to this prosperous scene on the market, it is often easy to forget the past. In the old society, in the capitalist market, although there were many commodities displayed in the store, what did this have to do with the working people? The poor have no money and still can't afford it. Although the capitalist market is also very "lively" and "prosperous" on the surface, this is just like a dying person covered with powder, which cannot cover up his pale and haggard nature. The so-called "prosperity" is a false and deformed prosperity. There are "empty checks" and "empty stack lists" in the market; there are bars, dance halls, casinos, and restaurants that are specially provided for the exploiting classes to corrupt and enjoy themselves. The amount of market transactions may be frighteningly large, but the business of real retail stores is very bleak. A news item in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on April 24, 1949, once described the plight of Shanghai stores at that time: "All the sales stores are sparsely populated, and business is deserted. Several department stores are particularly difficult. It is said that the daily business income is only enough to buy groceries and other daily expenses."
    Today, the prosperity of the socialist market in our country is the result of the vigorous development of national economic construction and the victory of socialist transformation in recent years; it is the fruits of victory obtained in the two fierce struggles of "who will defeat whom" in the "three antis" and "five antis" movements that cracked down on speculation, stabilized prices, and repelled the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie in the market. Therefore, this prosperity is true prosperity and stable prosperity.
    People's beautiful wishes and their pursuit of newer and higher material and cultural life have become the driving force for further development of production. In the past ten years, China's industrial and agricultural production has made unprecedented development, and there will be even greater leaps forward tomorrow. With the growth of production, people's lives will be better, and the market will become more prosperous.

    兴旺繁荣气象新
    ——记十年来我国市场的变化
    新华社记者　海蓝　叶世涛
    仅仅十年，我国社会主义的新型市场，随着国家经济建设的发展和社会主义改造的胜利，成长、壮大起来了。
    这十年，我国市场上经历了翻天复地的变化。资本主义旧市场的种种罪恶已经根除绝迹。旧市场上，投机商人兴风作浪，翻江倒海，给生产、人民生活带来了严重的破坏和危害；新市场上，社会主义商业千方百计支持生产发展，全心全意为消费者服务。今天，市场欣欣向荣，健康兴旺。透过市场这面镜子，我们看到了国家工农业生产飞速跃进的步伐，看到人民欢乐美好生活的景象。
            制服了动荡的物价
    物价是一个国家经济情况好坏的晴雨表。人们还记得，十年前，当祖国大地刚刚解放，举国人民欢欣鼓舞庆祝新生的时候，帝国主义和国民党反动派就期望在我解放的国土上，激起一场物价波动的逆潮。他们恶毒地诅咒：中国共产党只能在军事上胜利，不能使已经瘫痪的市场复活。被赶走的帝国主义分子冷冷地说：“物价波动足以使人民政权垮台。”国内的商业投机家挥着长袖说：“共产党没法制止物价波动。”地主们把肥胖的身子埋在竹椅里说：“你要东西，拿银元来。”
    但是历史是如此无情！诅咒总是那么可笑！十年过去了，中国共产党制服了历史上从未制服过的物价波动。这是一场尖锐的、艰巨的斗争。解放初期，国家在市场上抛售了大量物资，加强金融管理，发动全民进行反银元、金钞投机的斗争，统一全国财政经济，击溃了投机家们趁国家财政收支尚未平衡、国营经济立足未稳掀起的物价波动，使动荡多年的物价从此趋于稳定。
    从1950年3月起的近十年来，全国物价一直保持平稳，即使在市场上有些商品一度供不应求时，物价也仍然那么稳定。根据国家统计局的材料，我国北京、上海、天津等八大城市的零售价格指数如以1950年3月为100，那么1958年仅为101.4％。在上海，1950年3月份时，拿人民币（以新币计算）一元可以买到五点二市斤的中白粳大米或者是三十三点四斤煤球，或是两尺一九零号士林蓝布，或是四点三块固本肥皂；而到今天，一元人民币完全可以买到同样多的商品，有的还能买到更多。这样平稳的物价，旧中国一切统治阶级办不到，任何资本主义社会也不可能做到。
    今天，老一辈的人提到国民党反动统治时期的物价飞涨情况，还心有余悸。翻开十年以前的旧报纸，几乎满眼都是涨！涨！涨！
    ——涨风猛袭京沪，市场混乱，人们在惶恐中！（香港大公报，1948年6月27日）
      ——上周黄金风浪中，金钞轧涨一倍半、袁大头一马当先，轧涨二倍！（上海金融日报，1949年4月11日）
      ——涨风狂袭穗商场，市民谈“价”色变！（香港大公报，1948年11月7日）
    ——物价高涨，老者无人奉养，自缢身死。（北京世界日报）
    当时物价究竟涨了多少倍？根据历史资料，1937年6月到1948年8月国民党反动派崩溃前夕止，十一年中，一共上涨了六百万倍。这是一个多么可怕的天文数字！这个数字里面包含着多少人间惨剧！
    从当年伪上海市政府社会局和伪重庆市政府物价指数及物价统计资料中，可以看到国民党统治时期物价飞涨到了如何严重的程度，可以看到人民遭受的掠夺、搜刮和压榨是多么深重！我们可以用一百元伪法币的购买力来编制如下一个公式：
    1937年…………黄牛二头
    1939年…………猪一头
    1941年…………面粉一袋
    1943年…………鸡一只
    1945年…………鸡蛋二个
    1946年…………一块肥皂的1／6
    1947年…………煤球一个
    1949年…………一颗大米的千万分之2.45
    贵州省金沙城有位八十多岁的老大爷谯贵斋，至今还保存着一册很珍贵的老账簿。里面记着整整三十八年的账目。这既不是谯老大爷的家庭收支账，也不是什么商品交易账，而是每个时期的粮价、煤价……。据这位老大爷说，旧社会粮价日跳夜升。穷人最怕粮价涨，粮食一领头，什么东西都跟着上去，他特地把它记下来，看看究竟涨到什么时候才算到了头。
    老大爷的账到1950年就不记了。是老大爷缺乏恒心么？不是。因为“从那以后，粮价天天一样，没有记的必要了。”老大爷高兴地说，如果要记，倒不如刻个“同上”的图章，天天往上面盖一下得了！
          工农商携手忙生产
    揭开旧市场的盖子，里面黑幕重重，充满了投机、欺诈、剥削……。
    在上海，在天津，当时都有着大批为非作歹的投机“专家”。其中有帝国主义分子，也有官僚买办、投机商人。他们的投机办法无奇不有。有所谓“踢皮球”，一张商品栈单可以在几十个投机商人之间，像皮球一样抛来抛去，做了几十次交易，栈单后面盖上几十次“过户”的图章。其实他们连商品都没有看到，但在转售之间，却捞进了一大笔钞票。在投机市场上，商品已经不是商品，更谈不到使用价值，而是他们追逐暴利，投机倒把的筹码。那时候，一些“抢帽子”的投机商人，在股票、金钞、商品价格骤涨暴跌的狂浪中，混水摸鱼。大部分投机交易，卖方没有商品，买主也没有货币，一切靠买空卖空进行。
    在投机狂澜起伏的旧市场里，工商之间争夺利润，角逐市场。投机商业给正当的工业生产带来了无比的祸害。工厂产品销不出，就是卖出了，也因为物价飞涨，所得货款补不进同样数量的原料，生产奄奄一息。请看一段前“上海市工业会”在1949年5月11日致“国民政府”的自白：“目前本市工业成品外销已趋停顿……资金枯竭，罗掘俱穷，实已至无可奈何之境地。……”上海如此，其他城市的民族工业也不两样。许多工业资本家看到囤积、投机有利，也弃工就商，甚至就“囤”就“投”，把生产弃之脑后。
    今天，投机家也好，“冒险家”也好，早已被人民赶出了市场，作为他们孳生地的资本主义工商业也走上了社会主义的光明道路。解放以来，党和国家对资本主义工商业采取了利用、限制、改造的政策，通过加工、订货、经销、代销等国家资本主义形式，逐步进行社会主义改造。到1956年全国出现全行业公私合营的高潮，我国对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的历史任务就基本完成。全国市场从此成为统一的社会主义市场。
    社会主义商业从建立的第一天起，就把促进工业生产作为自己最主要的任务担当起来。社会主义制度下的工商部门，目标一致，利益一致，相互协作，相互促进。十年来，商业部门积极收购和推销工厂产品。1958年，上海商业部门收购的工业品，要比1950年增长十四倍。现在几乎每天就有价值二千多万元的各种工业品涌进国营商业的仓库和货栈，工厂产品一生产出来，马上就投入流转领域。这跟解放以前工厂产品销不出，原料补不进的萧条景象，构成了多么强烈的对照！
    不仅是这些，广大商业人员还深入工厂，挖潜力，作助手，配合工业部门解决原料困难；出主意，当参谋，协助工业部门全面安排生产；找资料，供设备，支持工厂大闹技术革命。当年上海的金融投机中心“证券大楼”，现在是国营五金机械、交通电工器材两个采购供应站，这个地方，过去是尽人皆知的投机“司令部”，现在是支持工业生产，安排市场供应的后勤部。由于他们积极支持工业增产，每年供应各地的五金、交电产品相当全国总供应量的一半左右。
    对农业，国营商业同样尽最大努力给予支持和帮助。
    每年春耕季节，商业人员携带资金和物资，到农村指导农民按国家计划安排生产，与农民签订农产品购销合同，帮助解决生产上的困难。每年，国营商业部门发放的农产品预购订金在十亿元以上。这些订金是无利息的，到秋收时仍按国家规定的价格收购。国家从各个方面支持和促进农业生产发展的结果，使国营商业部门的收购量越来越大，农民的生活越过越好。1958年国家收购的粮食、棉花、油料、烤烟、茶叶等产品分别比1952年增加一倍到六倍；1957年农民出售农副产品的收入，超过1952年的一半。
    旧中国城乡对立，城市掠夺、剥削乡村的关系一去不复返了。今天，城市和农村，工人和农民亲密地相互支援，相互协作。农村给城市提供了大批粮食以及棉花、麻、烟等工业原料。城市制造的生产资料和生活用品也源源下乡。农村春耕时，送去拖拉机和双轮双铧犁；秋收时又送去收割机、脱粒机；施肥有化学肥料；排涝抗旱有抽水机；发生虫害还有各种各样的农药和农械。这十年里，全国供应的排灌机械、农药、化学肥料等增长了几十倍。在上海、天津、广州这些工业城市，不论冬夏，无分昼夜，每天都有满载花布、内衣、胶鞋、自行车等日用百货的车船，驶往农村。商业人员深入农家，了解农民的爱好，根据他们的意见设计了不少新产品。印有孔雀开屏、百子图的花布，全开襟的卫生衫、矮胖的竹壳热水瓶……一直畅销农村。
    两个社会，两种商业，对待工业、农业的两种态度，泾渭分明。谁破坏生产，谁促进生产，人们自会得出结论。
            柜台内外情谊深
    旧市场是投机商人的“乐园”，劳动人民则视为畏途。人们到商店买东西，尽管怎样留神、提防，在资本家那一套哄、骗、欺、诈的手腕下，还是要上当，要吃亏。
    年龄大些的人还记得，当年来到城市的大街，农村的市集，几乎都有一片闹哄哄的叫卖声。有些商店厚着脸宣传自己的商品如何好，明明是当地的土织袜子，硬说是上海有名的“墨菊牌”；有些商店挂着“货真价实、言不二价”的大招牌，只要顾客多跑两家，西洋镜马上拆穿。棉布店以“加三放尺”招揽生意，其实他们的尺特别短，量布时又有特殊的手法，顾客回家复量，一尺还是一尺。不少商店还有所谓“勾引品”，选择几个小商品稍稍减低价格，登广告大吹大擂，不明真相的顾客上了钩，买到一样便宜货，却吃进了几样“老虎肉”。更恶劣的是有一种专门欺骗老实人的“老虎摊”。他们先用谎言把顾客吓跑，又用甜言蜜语把顾客哄回来。如果不买，他们就威胁、咒骂，强迫成交，按他们的行话，叫做“不打不骂不成交易”。
    资本主义商业就是这样欺骗顾客，剥削劳动人民。
    社会主义市场以崭新的姿态出现在人们面前，特别是1958年商业战线上大跃进以来，我国市场上更是气象万千。多少年来人们理想的“言不二价、童叟无欺”已经成为事实。
    “千方百计为顾客服务”，已经成为营业员们的行动指南。今天，在商店里，不能再把商品、货币看成顾客和营业员之间唯一的东西，虽然他们仍旧是通过交换的方式接触着，但是营业员与顾客之间，已经不是普通的买卖关系，而是情长谊深的亲人和朋友。
    在上海，为了让一个过路的旅客买到她喜爱的金鸡牌听装饼干，一个营业员又一个营业员，一家商店又一家商店到处为她物色，终于满足了顾客的要求。
    在哈尔滨，一个百货商店的营业员发现顾客匆忙间，买走了有污迹的裤子，连忙赶出去把她追回，给她换上好的。
    在商店里，人们还可以看到许多和买卖无关的事情。皮鞋店的营业员免费为顾客缝好脱线的皮鞋；粮食店营业员帮助附近居民改进烧饭方法，节约用粮；百货店女营业员主动在业余时间为单身顾客织毛线袜……这些难道能列入商品交易的范围吗？而这些事情，今天在祖国各地的商店里，经常都在发生着。
    国营商业肩负着“管家人”的光荣任务。商业人员既要为顾客服务好，又要尽量让人们买到称心满意的东西。为着人民生活日益提高的需要，千千万万采购员风尘仆仆，组织货源。调运副食品的采购员，更是不辞辛劳，甚至不顾生命危险，奔波江海河野，走遍山林草原，废寝忘食，餐风饮露。在西南的采购员押着牛群翻过云贵丛岭；在安徽的采购员赶着鸭子渡过长江激流。为着人民的需要，商业部门既要经营足够的“大路货”，也要供应很多零星、特殊的小商品和高档商品，既要经营成套整件的商品，也要供应细小的零件和配件。
              繁荣更繁荣
    今天我国市场到处一片繁荣兴旺景象。无论大城市或是农村，商店或是供销社，都是顾客盈门。上海市国营第一百货商店，每天就要接待近十万的顾客，星期假日更要达到二十万到三十万人次。商店每天成交的买卖大约在四万笔左右，以去年的营业额计算，平均每秒钟就做了一笔四元六角的交易。在车站、码头，物资南来北往，进城下乡，更是忙碌非常。
    十年来，国营商业部门供应的生活用品虽然年年增长，仍旧远远不能满足需要。1958年的全国社会商品零售总额比1950年增加了两倍多，而今年头七个月又比去年同期增长20％以上。这样飞速的增长，在我国历史上是空前的。
    六亿五千万人民生活普遍提高后涌现出来的巨大购买力，正是我国社会主义市场繁荣的源泉。今天的中国人民，不但摆脱了解放前那种“终年劳动，不得一饱”、“今年盼望明年好，明年仍是一件破棉袄”的悲苦日子，而且在解决吃、穿、住等根本问题之后，生活越过越美好。工人、农民的最高愿望，已经不是柴、米、油、盐、酱、醋、茶的开门七件事，而是几十件、几百件事。他们需要搪瓷面盆、手电筒、金笔、暖水瓶、毛毯、绒衣、自行车，甚至连一些过去想都不敢想的东西，像呢绒、绸缎、手表、收音机、缝纫机，现在也成了他们家庭里不很稀罕的家当了。十年来，这些商品的销售量都是成倍成倍的增长。
    有人问，解放以后中国工人与农民的生活到底提高了多少？据国家统计局的材料，1958年和1952年比较，全国职工购买力增加了一倍半，农民购买力增长了70％左右。
    看惯了市场上这种兴旺繁荣的景象，往往叫人容易忘记过去的日子。在旧社会，在资本主义市场，商店里尽管陈列着很多商品，但这与劳动人民有什么关系呢？穷人没有钱，还是买不起。尽管资本主义市场表面上也很“热闹”、“繁荣”，但这正像垂死的人脸上涂满脂粉，也掩盖不了他苍白、憔悴的本色。所谓“繁荣”是虚假的、畸形的繁荣。那里市场上，有的是“空头支票”、“空头栈单”；有的是专供剥削阶级腐化作乐的酒巴间、舞厅、赌场、酒楼，市场交易的金额也许大得吓人，但真正零售商店的营业却很清淡。1949年4月24日上海大公报的一条新闻中，曾经描写了当时上海商店的窘态：“各门售店都门可罗雀，生意寥落，几家百货公司尤感困难。据说每天营业收入只够买买小菜等日常开支。”
    今天我国社会主义市场的繁荣，是几年来国家经济建设蓬勃发展和社会主义改造胜利的结果；是市场上经过了打击投机、平稳物价，回击资产阶级猖狂进攻的“三反”、“五反”运动两场“谁战胜谁”的激烈斗争获得的胜利果实。因此，这个繁荣是真正的繁荣，稳定的繁荣。
    人们的美好愿望，人们对物质生活与文化生活更新更高的追求，已经变为推动生产进一步发展的动力。过去的十年里，我国的工农业生产有了空前的发展，明天还有更大的跃进。随着生产的增长，人民生活将会更美好，市场将变得更繁荣。
