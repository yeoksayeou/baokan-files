Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. On the eve of the 14th anniversary of the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, more than 700 workers and cadres from government organizations in the capital, together with Vietnamese comrades in Beijing, celebrated this glorious festival of the Vietnamese people at the Labor People's Cultural Palace tonight.

At the get-together, which was filled with a festive atmosphere, Sun Xiaocun, Vice President of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, and Pham Binh, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, delivered speeches full of friendly passion. In his speech, Sun Xiaocun warmly praised the brilliant achievements of the Vietnamese people in socialist construction and socialist transformation. He said that the Chinese people felt infinite excitement and encouragement about the achievements of the Vietnamese people. Sun Xiaocun emphasized that the Vietnamese people have made great efforts to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland, maintain peace in Indochina, and fully implement the Geneva Accords, and are making unremitting efforts for this purpose. Sun Xiaocun said: The people of China and Vietnam are as close as brothers, sharing weal and woe, and their safety is intertwined. We resolutely oppose the war plots of U.S. imperialism in Indochina, and we firmly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to maintain peace and demand the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

In his speech, Charge d'Affaires ad interim Pham Binh introduced the inspiring and great achievements made by the Vietnamese people in socialist construction. He said: In the upsurge of building socialism, the Vietnamese people never forget that half of our country is still divided; the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are blatantly undermining the Geneva Accords, and the United States is trying to turn South Vietnam into its colony and military base. Due to U.S. interference, the situation in our neighbor Laos is developing more and more seriously, which directly threatens the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Charge d'Affaires ad interim Pham Binh said: We continue to wage a resolute struggle to maintain the Geneva Accords and to stop the intervention of U.S. imperialism. We believe that the war preparations plot of U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated shamefully, and the cause of peace and friendship will surely win a brilliant victory. In his speech, Charge d'Affaires ad interim Pham Binh also warmly congratulated the ever-consolidating and developing long-standing friendship between the people of Vietnam and China.

At this get-together, which was sponsored by the China-Vietnam Friendship Association and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, comrades from China and Vietnam also enthusiastically participated in various recreational activities.

Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. Yang Xiufeng, President of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, sent a telegram to Bui Ky, President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, today, warmly congratulating the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The telegram congratulated the Vietnamese people on their new and brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction, and wished the brotherly friendship between the people of China and Vietnam further consolidated and developed.
