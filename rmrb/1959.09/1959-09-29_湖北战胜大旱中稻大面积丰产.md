Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th: Over fourteen million mu of mid-season rice in Hubei Province has been basically harvested, except for a few high-altitude mountainous areas where harvesting is not yet complete.

This year, from the beginning of heading and flowering to harvesting, mid-season rice in Hubei suffered from a drought unseen in decades, with the drought period accounting for nearly two-thirds of the entire growing season. Faced with the severe drought, Party committees at all levels led the broad masses of farmers in arduous and outstanding drought-resistant struggles. People's communes in various places fully demonstrated the superiority of large collectives and large-scale cooperation in the fight against the disaster. Except for approximately ten-plus percent of mid-season rice fields that experienced localized yield reductions or severe yield losses due to the depletion of surrounding water sources, most areas basically achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of mid-season rice.

Huanggang Special District, which suffered from drought for more than two months, saw people's communes in various places oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and vigorously engage in drought resistance to ensure a bumper harvest. As a result, the total output of mid-season rice in the district increased by 24% compared to the bumper harvest of last year, with an average yield of 680 jin per mu, an increase of 15.7% over last year. Among them, the counties in the Dabie Mountain area, such as Yingshan, Luotian, Macheng, and Hongan, had the largest increase in total output of mid-season rice. Yingshan increased by 84.3%, Luotian increased by 76.8%, and Macheng and Hongan also increased by more than 20% to 30% respectively. These counties all vigorously engaged in water conservancy construction on the one hand, changing dry land into paddy fields and expanding the area of mid-season rice to achieve the goal of planting more and harvesting more. On the other hand, they resolutely implemented field management work centered on drought resistance, conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and strived to increase yield per unit area.

    湖北战胜大旱中稻大面积丰产
    据新华社武汉28日电　湖北省一千四百多万亩中稻，除了少数高寒山区尚未收割外，已基本收割完毕。
    今年，湖北各地中稻从开始抽穗扬花到收割，遭到了数十年来罕见的干旱，干旱时间几乎占去了整个中稻生长过程的三分之二时间。在严重的旱情面前，各级党委领导广大农民进行了艰苦卓越的抗旱斗争，各地人民公社在抗灾斗争中充分发挥了大集体大协作的优越性。除了大约占百分之十几的中稻田因周围水源枯竭而局部减产或严重减产以外，各地都基本上取得了中稻大面积丰收。
    受旱两个多月的黄冈专区，各地人民公社反右倾，鼓干劲，大闹抗旱保丰收，结果使全区中稻总产量比大丰收的去年增产24％，平均亩产六百八十斤，比去年增长15.7％。其中尤以大别山区的英山、罗田、麻城、红安等县中稻总产量增长幅度最大，英山增长84.3％，罗田增长76.8％，麻城和红安也分别增产两成多到三成多。这些县都是一方面大搞水利建设，改旱地为水田，扩大中稻面积，达到多种多收的目的；一方面坚决贯彻以抗旱为中心的田间管理工作，认真执行农业“八字宪法”，力求提高单位面积产量。
