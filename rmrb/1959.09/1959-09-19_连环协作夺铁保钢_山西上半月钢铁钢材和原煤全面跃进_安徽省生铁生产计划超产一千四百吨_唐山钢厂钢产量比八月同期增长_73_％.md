    Chain Collaboration Wins Iron and Ensures Steel
    Shanxi Sees All-Around Leap Forward in Steel, Steel Materials, and Raw Coal in the First Half of the Month
    Anhui Province Exceeds Pig Iron Production Plan by 1,400 Tons
    Tangshan Steel Plant's Steel Output Increases by 73% Compared to the Same Period in August
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the steel and coal industrial workers in Shanxi Province launched a fervent chain collaboration competition in the first half of this month, promoting an all-around leap forward in the production of steel, iron, steel materials, and raw coal. Compared to the same period in August, the province's steel output increased by 16.4%, iron output increased by 34.7%, steel materials output increased by 14.6%, and raw coal output increased by 24%.
    Since the beginning of September, the vast number of workers on the province's industrial front have enthusiastically studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, rapidly launching a production increase and conservation competition to learn from and catch up with advanced workers, pushing production to a new peak. The head-to-head competition among workshops, groups, and sections of many enterprises has developed into a chain collaboration competition centered on steel, iron, and steel materials, with everyone sharing the same goals, creating conditions for each other, and advancing together. Due to launching a competition to seize iron and ensure steel in the first half of the month, workers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company have seen the company's production level rise day by day. Compared to the same period in August, steel increased by 10.9%, iron increased by 2.1%, and steel materials increased by 6.5%. The young blast furnace workers took the initiative to visit various auxiliary sections, soliciting opinions, strengthening collaboration, and improving the production of each auxiliary section, thus rapidly increasing the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace, averaging 2.588 in the first half of September, an increase of 0.25 compared to the same period last month. At the same time, they also strengthened collaboration with open-hearth furnace workers, improving the supply of molten iron according to the requirements of the open-hearth furnace, thereby greatly improving the past situation where the open-hearth furnace was waiting for molten iron, ensuring the needs of open-hearth steelmaking.
    Various coal mines have also launched chain collaboration competitions. The tunneling workers in the Datong, Yangquan, and Xishan coal mines have universally launched competitions to accelerate tunneling footage, excavating more working faces for mining and ensuring that coal production rises day by day. The electromechanical workers of the No. 3 Mine of the Yangquan Coal Mine have also formed six shock teams to go deep into the well, strengthening the maintenance of coal chutes and the installation of machinery, in order to ensure the regular cycle of the working faces.
    On the transportation front, a massive mass movement of short-distance transportation has also been launched, continuously transporting raw materials for the steel industry and transporting pit props and other equipment for the coal industry.
    The chain collaboration competition is a new development of the head-to-head competition in the previous stage. Because the chain collaboration competition tightly links various production departments together, it not only guarantees the production of key production units but also promotes the overall leap forward of the entire enterprise, mobilizing the enthusiasm of various industries and departments.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the workers on the Anhui steel front have completed the pig iron production plan for the first half of the month, exceeding it by 1,400 tons one day ahead of schedule, during the great battle of September. From the 1st to the 14th, the province produced a total of 96,400 tons of pig iron, an increase of 29,300 tons compared to the same period last month, and the average qualified rate of pig iron increased from 84% in August to over 86%.
    The workers of small and medium-sized blast furnaces in Anhui Province have universally and conscientiously studied the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, overcoming the emotions of fear of difficulty and slackening, as well as right-leaning conservative thinking, which existed among a small number of cadres, and have mustered greater energy, conscientiously promoted the advanced experiences of the country and the province, and universally carried out technical transformation of small blast furnaces, so that pig iron production has risen day by day.
    Transforming hot blast stoves to extend their lifespan is an important part of their technical transformation. For example, the hot blast stove of the Provincial Party Committee Organ Steel Plant has thin hot air pipe diameters and thin pipe walls, with many joints, making it easy to be bent and cracked by high temperatures, causing frequent air leakage and temperature drops, and the lifespan of the hot blast stove is also very short, generally only lasting two weeks to a month before requiring repair. Now, they are using high-quality iron produced by their own plant to cast hot air pipes, changing the structure of the hot air pipes, reducing the number of joints in the pipes, enlarging the inner diameter of the pipes, and thickening the pipe walls. As a result, air leakage has been basically eliminated, the air volume has greatly increased, and the air temperature has stabilized at above 550 degrees Celsius. The lifespan of the hot blast stove has also been extended. Wuhu, Bengbu, Anqing, Hefei and other regions have all promoted the experience of the Provincial Party Committee Organ Steel Plant in transforming hot blast stoves.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 17th. The Tangshan Steel Plant in Hebei Province achieved a great harvest in the first half of September, overfulfilling the state plan for steel production by 16.55%, an increase of 73% compared to the same period in August, with a qualified rate reaching 99.43%. All the workers of the plant are resolutely ensuring the completion of the state plan for steel production for September five days ahead of schedule, offering a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    Since September, leading cadres at all levels of the Tangshan Steel Plant, after opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting revolutionary vigor, have gone deep into the workshops to grasp production, ideology, and measures, timely solving key problems in production. Workers in the steelmaking workshops launched head-to-head competitions, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient electricity and weak ingot-making and slag-hauling capacity, so that steel production gradually increased. The average daily output of steel during the high-yield week (from the 7th to the 13th) increased by 11.2% compared to the average daily output from the 1st to the 6th. Auxiliary workshops and various departments also closely supported steelmaking production according to production requirements.

    连环协作夺铁保钢
    山西上半月钢铁钢材和原煤全面跃进
    安徽省生铁生产计划超产一千四百吨
    唐山钢厂钢产量比八月同期增长73％
    据新华社讯　山西钢铁和煤炭工业职工在本月上半月展开热烈的连环协作大竞赛，促使钢、铁、钢材和原煤生产全面大跃进。9月上半月同8月同期比较，全省的钢产量增长了16.4％，铁产量增长了34.7％，钢材产量增长了14.6％，原煤产量增长了24％。
    进入9月以来，全省工业战线上的广大职工热烈学习了党的八中全会文件，迅速地掀起了学先进、赶先进的增产节约竞赛热潮，把生产推向了一个新的高峰。许多企业的车间、小组、工段的对手竞赛，发展成为围绕钢、铁、钢材为中心的连环协作竞赛，大家目标一致，相互创造条件，共同高涨。太原钢铁公司职工由于在上半月掀起了夺铁保钢的竞赛热潮，使全公司的生产水平逐日上升；跟8月同期相比，钢提高10.9％，铁提高2.1％，钢材提高6.5％。青年高炉职工主动拜访各个辅助工段，征求意见，加强协作，改进了各辅助工段的生产，因而使高炉利用系数迅速提高，9月上半月平均达到二点五八八，比上月同期提高零点二五。同时，他们还同平炉职工加强协作，按平炉的要求改进铁水的供应，从而大大改善了过去平炉等铁水的状况，保证了平炉炼钢的需要。
    各个煤矿也开展了连环协作竞赛。大同、阳泉、西山等煤矿的掘进工人，普遍展开了加快掘进进尺的竞赛，为回采掘出更多的工作面，保证煤炭产量日日上升。阳泉煤矿三矿的机电工人，还组成了六个突击组深入井下，加强煤溜子检修和机械安装，来保证工作面的正规循环。
    在运输战线上，也展开了一个声势浩大的短途运输的群众运动，为钢铁工业源源运来了原料，为煤炭工业运来了坑木等各种器材。
    连环协作竞赛，是前一阶段对手竞赛的新发展。由于连环协作竞赛把各个生产部门都紧紧地连在一起，因此不但保证了重点生产单位的生产，同时也促进了整个企业的全面跃进，调动了各个行业和各个部门的积极性。
    据新华社讯　安徽钢铁战线的职工在大战9月中，已提前一天超额一千四百吨完成了上半月的生铁生产计划。全省1日至14日共产生铁九万六千四百吨，比上月同期增加二万九千三百吨，生铁平均合格率从8月的84％提高到86％以上。
    安徽省中小型高炉的职工，普遍认真学习了党的八届八中全会公报和决议，克服了存在于少数干部中的畏难松劲情绪和右倾保守思想，鼓足更大干劲，认真推广全国和省的先进经验，普遍进行了小高炉的技术改造工作，使生铁产量逐日上升。
    改造热风炉，使它延长寿命，是他们进行技术改造的一项重要内容。如省委机关钢铁厂的热风炉，热风管的管径细、管壁薄，接头多，易被高温烧弯烧裂，跑风和风温下降情况经常发生，而且热风炉的寿命也很短，一般只能用两星期到一个月就要修理。现在，他们用本厂生产的优质铁铸造热风管，改变了热风管的结构，使管道的接头减少，管道的内径扩大，管壁加厚，结果，跑风现象基本消灭，风量大大增加，风温稳定在摄氏五百五十度以上。热风炉的寿命也延长了。芜湖、蚌埠、安庆、合肥等地区，都推广了省委机关钢铁厂改造热风炉的经验。
    新华社天津17日电　河北唐山钢厂9月上半月获得大丰收，钢产量超额16.55％完成国家计划，比8月同期增长73％，合格率达到99.43％。全厂职工坚决保证提前五天完成9月份的钢产量国家计划，向建国十周年献礼。
    9月份以来，唐山钢厂各级领导干部经过反右倾、鼓足了革命干劲，深入车间抓生产、抓思想、抓措施，及时解决生产中的关键问题，炼钢车间工人展开了对手竞赛，战胜了电力不足和制锭、运渣能力薄弱的困难，使钢产量逐步上升，高产周（7日至13日）的钢的平均日产量，比1日至6日的平均日产量提高11.2％。辅助车间和各科室也紧紧根据生产的要求，有力地支援了炼钢生产。
