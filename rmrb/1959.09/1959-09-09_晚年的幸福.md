Happiness in Old Age
By our reporter Ma Qizhi

　　On the north side of a wide road, on a hillside surrounded by fruit trees, stand several blue brick and tile houses, appearing so serene and peaceful. Stepping into the courtyard, not a single weed can be seen. Around the courtyard are various fruit trees; in the middle of the courtyard are two flower beds, blooming with various flowers. The dozens of rooms all face the sun, each with bright and clean windows; the interiors are painted white and reflective, and on the wall hangs a red satin banner, which reads, "In the old society, we were helpless and uncared for; in the new society, we have food, clothing, and respect." This is the Eight-One Respect for the Aged Home in the Hongling Management District of the Eight-One People's Commune in Shenyang County. This Respect for the Aged Home is one of the six established by the Eight-One People's Commune in Shenyang County. Sixty elderly people with no relatives or support live here. Among them are fourteen elderly couples with white hair, as well as several elderly people with disabilities. The Respect for the Aged Home has single rooms specially for elderly couples to live out their lives together, as well as separate male and female dormitories for widowed elderly people; there are also bathhouses and a club. The elderly people here happily spend their later years without worry.
　　
　　When the reporter visited the Respect for the Aged Home, he happened to meet an elderly man in his seventies, Zhang Dianfang, who was riding in a cart provided by the commune to visit his grandson dozens of miles away. Here, the elderly really don't have to worry about food and clothing and live freely. Liu Yongfa, a sixty-nine-year-old man, told the reporter amusingly, "This year during the first month, my old wife and I went to Harbin to see our daughter. We originally planned to stay for a few months, but we just couldn't stay there. We came back together in less than a month." The elderly always feel that living with relatives is not as comfortable as living in their own home, the Respect for the Aged Home. In the room of an elderly couple with white hair, the reporter met Hou Wanling, a seventy-five-year-old man. They were sitting on a clean kang, with several other elderly people sitting beside them. After breakfast, they gathered together to chat happily. Old man Hou Wanling said excitedly to me: "In the past, it was difficult for us to live on our own. My wife can't see, and my body isn't good either. I'm sick all year round and have to take care of housework. After we came to the Respect for the Aged Home, not only don't we have to worry about food and clothing, but even my illness has been cured." When he was sick, the doctor from the management district's health clinic came to see him every day, and the cook brought the steaming noodle soup to him personally... The old man's years of old illness were quickly cured. The commune Party committee showed meticulous care for the lives of the elderly, and specially sent Ren Anlu, the Party branch secretary of the production team, to take specific care of and arrange the lives of the elderly. At the time of the construction of the home, the commune chose the houses where the elderly lived next to the production team office, so that the cadres could visit them at any time. Not long after the elderly entered the home, the commune provided each of them with the necessary bedding and clothing, and also gave them some pocket money every month. The management district's doctors also regularly came to examine the elderly; the young women in the commune often helped the elderly to take apart and wash clothes and bedding; the supply and marketing cooperative, stores, and grain stations delivered the things needed by the Respect for the Aged Home to their doorstep and gave priority to the elderly. During festivals, commune cadres, members, local troops, and students all came to the Respect for the Aged Home to express their regards. However, the elderly people in the Respect for the Aged Home still maintained the true qualities of working people. This spring, some of the elderly who still had the ability to work, seeing the upsurge of agricultural production in the commune, took the initiative to organize themselves to do some work within their capacity—planting vegetables, potatoes, squash, flue-cured tobacco, and melons, and also raising more than a dozen sows and small fattening pigs. Now, the vegetables planted by the elderly are very lush, and they can't even eat them all themselves. On August 1st this year, the elderly put on new clothes made by the Respect for the Aged Home and held a joyful anniversary celebration of the establishment of the home. They also slaughtered a large fat pig they had raised themselves and held a feast of eight large bowls, inviting leading cadres from all aspects of the commune to eat, expressing the elderly's gratitude to the Party and the government for their care. The happy life that the elderly live in the Respect for the Aged Home is all brought about by communization. Originally, these elderly people were all "Five Guarantees" households in the agricultural cooperatives. In the old society, they mostly carried heavy loads for landlords since they were young and suffered all their lives. After liberation, these elderly people enjoyed government relief all year round. After the organization of agricultural cooperatives, they enjoyed the "Five Guarantees" treatment. Although the agricultural cooperatives tried various ways to take care of them, their lives were still a bit inconvenient due to dispersed residence. For example, cooking and heating the kang had to be taken care of by themselves. With the establishment of the commune, the commune established the Respect for the Aged Home for the elderly, so that they could live more comfortably and peacefully.

    晚年的幸福
    本报记者　马启智
    一条大车道的北侧，果树环绕的山丘上，有几座青砖瓦房，显得那么宁静、安逸。走进院里，看不到一点杂草，院子周围，是各种果树；院子中间，有两个花坛，盛开着各种鲜花。几十间房子，都向着太阳，每间都是窗明几净；屋内粉刷得洁白反光，墙上挂的红缎锦旗，写着“旧时代无依无靠无人管，新社会有衣有食有人敬”。这里是沈阳县八一人民公社红菱管理区的八一敬老院。这个敬老院是沈阳县八一人民公社所建立的六个敬老院中的一个。在这里住着六十位无依无靠的老人。其中有十四对白发苍苍的老夫妇，还有几个有残疾的老人。敬老院里有专供老夫妇白头到老的单间，也有鳏寡老人分别居住的男女宿舍；还有澡堂、俱乐部。老人们在这里无忧无虑地欢度晚年。
    记者在访问敬老院的时候，正好碰见一位七十多岁的老人张殿芳，乘坐社里给套的一辆大车，去几十里以外的地方看望外孙子。在这里，老人们真是吃穿不操心，生活得自由自在。六十九岁的老人刘永发，有趣地告诉记者：“今年正月，我和我的老伴到哈尔滨去看女儿，原来打算住上几个月，可是在那里怎么也呆不住，没住到一个月，就又一块回来了。”老人们总觉得在亲戚家，不如在敬老院这个自己的家生活的更随便。在一对白发苍苍的老夫妇的房间里，记者见到一位七十五岁的老人侯万灵，他俩坐在整洁的炕上，旁边还坐着几位老人。他们吃过早饭后，聚在一起快活地闲谈。侯万灵老人兴奋地对我说：“从前我们自己过日子很难，老伴眼睛看不着，我身板又不好，常年闹病，还得料理家务。我们到敬老院以后，不仅吃穿不用愁，连我的病也给治好了。”在他有病的时候，管理区卫生所的医生，每天都来给他看病，炊事员把热气腾腾的面汤，亲手端到他的面前……老人家多年的老病，很快就养好了。公社党委对老人们生活是无微不至的关怀，特意派生产队党支书任安禄来敬老院具体地照顾和安排老人们的生活。在建院的当时，社里就把老人住的房子选择在生产队办公室的旁边，便于干部们随时都可以过去看望。老人们入院不久，社里给每位老人添置了必需的被褥和衣服，并且每月还发给老人们一些零花钱。管理区的医生还经常来给老人们检查身体；社里的年青妇女们时常帮助老人们拆洗衣服和被褥；供销社、商店、粮站，都把敬老院需要的东西送上门，并优先照顾老人。逢年过节，社干部、社员、当地驻军、学生都前来敬老院慰问。但是，敬老院里的老人们，都还保持着劳动人民的本色。今年春天，一些还有劳动能力的老人们，见到公社里掀起热火朝天的农业增产高潮，他们便主动地组织起来，干一些力所能及的活——种青菜、土豆、窝瓜、黄烟和甜瓜，还饲养了十几口母猪、小肥猪。现在，老人们种的蔬菜很茁壮，自己都吃不了。在今年8月1日这天，老人们穿上敬老院给做的新衣裳，兴高彩烈地举行建院周年纪念会，还杀了一口自己养的大肥猪，办了八大碗的席，邀请社里各方面的领导干部去吃饭，表示老人们对党和政府对他们的关怀和照顾的感谢。老人们在敬老院里所过的幸福生活，都是公社化给带来的。原来，这些老人们都是农业社的“五保”户，在旧社会他们多是从小就给地主扛大活，受了一辈子苦。解放后，这些老人常年享受政府的救济，组织农业合作社后，他们又享受了“五保”的待遇。尽管农业社想出各种办法照顾他们，但是由于居住分散，生活仍然还有些不方便，比如做饭、烧炕等一些家务活，都得自己去操管。随着公社的建立，社里给老人们办了敬老院，这样他们才能生活得更加舒适、安逸。
