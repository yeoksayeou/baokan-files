Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 23rd: The "Al Nada" newspaper published an article today refuting the Cairo "Today's News" weekly's article that denied that the UAE authorities had arrested Lebanese Communist leader Houlou. The newspaper stated that this article "conceals a conspiracy to endanger Houlou's life."

"Al Nada" stated that "Today's News" published a lengthy article on September 19th, attempting to deny that the UAE authorities had arrested Houlou, and groundlessly claimed that "Communist parties around the world have unanimously agreed to launch a movement against the UAE," and also falsely accused "the leadership organizations of Communist parties in Prague of telling Houlou not to appear."

In refuting the aforementioned fabricated slander, "Al Nada" pointed out that the letters and telegrams sent to Cairo from all over the world were not some "movement against the UAE." They were merely demanding that the UAE authorities release a Lebanese and Arab patriot and send him back to his homeland.

"Al Nada" then published detailed information about the UAE authorities' arrest of Houlou on the streets of Damascus on June 25th. This information described how the UAE authorities arrested Houlou at the time, how he was tortured in prison, how the Syrian regional Minister of Interior refused to meet with Lebanese lawyer Michel Akqin, who was entrusted by Houlou's wife to defend Houlou's case, and refused to discuss the matter with him, and how Houlou's close friends had seen Houlou in Damascus in a jeep, wearing a white shirt, sitting between two policemen, looking very thin.

"Al Nada" pointed out, "All this proves that Houlou was arrested in Damascus and is currently in the hands of the special bureau that is torturing him in various ways. The most powerful evidence is that it is known that Farajalla Houlou is registered in the special bureau and prison under the name of Assaf Mansour." The newspaper then pointed out that the purpose of the article in "Today's News" is to "find excuses for the heinous crimes committed against this great national leader of Lebanon."

"Al Nada" also pointed out that only when the UAE authorities release Houlou and send him back to Lebanon will the thunderous calls of "Release Houlou!" cease.

The newspaper finally called on the Lebanese authorities to negotiate with the UAE authorities to secure Houlou's release.

    黎巴嫩“呼声报”发表文章指出
    阿联无法否认逮捕赫卢
    开罗报纸的言论隐藏着危害赫卢生命的阴谋
    新华社贝鲁特23日电　“呼声报”今天发表一篇文章，驳斥开罗“今日消息”周报关于否认阿联当局曾经逮捕黎巴嫩共产党领袖赫卢的文章。这家报纸说，这篇文章的“背后隐藏着危害赫卢性命的阴谋。”
      “呼声报”说，“今日消息”在9月19日发表了一篇长文章，企图否认阿联当局曾经逮捕赫卢，并且毫无根据地说，“世界各国共产党已经一致同意展开反对阿联的运动”，而且诬蔑“在布拉格的各国共产党领导机构曾经叫赫卢不要露面”。
    “呼声报”在驳斥上述捏造的谰言时指出，从世界各地纷纷送往开罗的函电根本不是什么“反对阿联的运动”。它们只是要求阿联当局释放一个黎巴嫩人和阿拉伯爱国者，把他送回他的祖国。
    “呼声报”接着发表了阿联当局6月25日在大马士革的大街上逮捕赫卢的详细消息。这条消息描述了阿联当局当时如何逮捕赫卢，他在监狱中如何受折磨，叙利亚地区内政部长如何拒绝接见受赫卢的妻子委托为赫卢案件辩护的黎巴嫩律师米歇尔·阿克勤，并且拒绝同他讨论这个问题，赫卢的亲近朋友如何曾经在大马士革看见赫卢在一辆吉普车上，身穿白色上衣，坐在两个警察之间，样子很瘦。
      “呼声报”指出，“这一切都证明赫卢是在大马士革被捕的，他目前是在用各种方法折磨着他的特别局手中。最有力的证据是，人们知道法拉贾拉·赫卢在特别局和监狱里是被登记为阿萨夫·曼苏尔这个名字的。”这家报纸接着指出，“今日消息”上的文章的目的在于“为对黎巴嫩这位伟大的民族领袖犯下的丑恶罪行寻找借口”。
    “呼声报”还指出，只有阿联当局释放赫卢并把他送回黎巴嫩，“释放赫卢！”的雷鸣般的呼声才会停息下来。
    这家报纸最后要求黎巴嫩当局向阿联当局交涉，争取释放赫卢。
