"The public canteen is a beautiful flower, bachelors have a home, women don't revolve around the stove, and focus on production without worry." This is a folk song from last year's people's commune movement, praising the public canteen. A year has passed, and the undeniable facts increasingly demonstrate the benefits of public canteens. Many public canteens are becoming more experienced, more on track, and are attracting more people to participate, thereby powerfully promoting production and improving people's lives. In Yonglong People's Commune, Jing Mountain County, Hubei Province, there is an August First Canteen. Initially, it was a temporary farm-busy canteen, with only seven households participating. Later, because people participating in the canteen saved time from cooking separately, earned significantly more work points than others, and increased their income, it was transformed into a year-round canteen at the request of commune members. At the same time, the number of households participating in the canteen also increased, now reaching one hundred and six. This example is enough to prove that anything that meets the needs of the masses has a strong vitality.

However, even towering trees attract ants that want to shake them. It is said that there was a leader who, according to his own right-leaning views, believed that public canteens were an ominous thing and insisted on ordering their dissolution. The commune members were unwilling, and he dared to fly into a rage. The commune members said, "Our canteen is good, even thunder can't break it up." Guess what that leader said? "I am the God of Thunder, and I will break you up!" As a result, the masses dispersed on the first day, but gathered together again the next day.

Public canteens are unbreakable by thunder!

The tragedy of right-leaning opportunists (like the aforementioned leader who thought he was so clever) lies in their inability to see the mainstream of the movement. Their minds are filled with conservatism and fear of the masses. Whenever they get the chance, they act up. When they see some shortcomings in the development of things, they panic and make a fuss. But in the end, they are the ones who suffer.

Let's take another example. The public canteen of Yongxing Production Team, Fushui People's Commune, Anlu County, Hubei, once stirred up a storm. Because the Yongxing Production Team's canteen was too large, difficult to manage, wasted grain, and wasted labor, it caused dissatisfaction among the masses, who demanded that the canteen be reduced in size. But the production team leader became suspicious of the superiority of the canteen from then on, feeling that running the canteen was not worth the loss, and it would be better to disband it. Under his orders, the canteens of several small teams were forced to disband. Only one small team leader believed that the canteen was related to the lives of the commune members and the production of the small team, and could not be established or disbanded at will, so he handed the problem over to the masses for discussion. The masses were unwilling to disband no matter what, and insisted on continuing to run it. After a few days, comparing the small team that ran the canteen with the second small team that did not, in terms of production, the attendance rate of the first small team was high, and the labor efficiency was high. In one month, it produced seventy-three more work points than the second small team. In terms of living standards, the first small team saved grain, and the food costs were only 2.5 yuan per person per month, while the living standards of the second small team varied, but the average food cost was more than 3 yuan per person per month. The facts were clear. Thus, on a voluntary basis, canteens were established one after another.

Although this production team leader did not compare himself to the God of Thunder, his ideological essence was the same as that of the comrade mentioned earlier. People of this kind, with right-leaning conservative ideas, unlike the vast majority of people, do not look at the important significance of public canteens for liberating labor and realizing the socialization of housework from the essence, recognizing that commune members ultimately support and support public canteens, and only ask for improvements in work. They do not strive to overcome difficulties, correct shortcomings, and run the canteens better, so that new things can take root and blossom. They take another path, which is to emphasize difficulties, exaggerate shortcomings, become weak and timid in front of them, even lying on the ground, hindering the forward development of the mass movement.

On the road to the Great Leap Forward, those who only follow the usual routine are like blind people who cannot see the light, and always turn black and white upside down and confuse right and wrong. Comrade Mao Zedong once talked about this kind of person, saying, "When a new thing appears, they always disapprove of it and oppose it first." He also said, "This kind of person is always passive, always stops at the critical moment, and always needs someone to slap him hard on the back before he is willing to take a step forward." Then, let us slap this kind of person on the back! The situation is pressing, and time waits for no one. You should quickly admit defeat. Even if you become the God of Thunder, you will never break up the enthusiasm of the masses to build socialism. Only by becoming a warm and gentle spring breeze, blowing and nourishing the new flowers that never fade, will the people reach out to you.

    雷打不散
    李素
    “公共食堂一枝花，单身汉子有了家，妇女不绕锅台转，一心生产无牵挂”。这是去年人民公社化运动中，人们称赞公共食堂的一首民歌。时间过了一年，摆在面前的铁的事实愈益表明了公共食堂的好处。许多公共食堂越办越有经验，越办越上路，也越能吸引更多的群众参加，从而有力地推动了生产，改善了群众生活。湖北省京山县永隆人民公社有一个八一食堂，最初是临时性的农忙食堂，参加的只有七户。后来因为参加食堂的人，节省了单独烧火做饭的时间，做的工分大大超过了别的人，增加了收入，于是，在社员群众的要求下，改成了常年食堂，同时参加食堂的户数也愈来愈多，现在已经增加到一百零六户了。这个例子足以证明：凡是符合群众需要的事物，总是具有强大的生命力的。
    然而，大树参天，也还是会招来一些想摇撼它的蚍蜉。据说有这么一位领导人，按照他自己的右倾观点，认定公共食堂是个不祥之物，一定要下令解散。社员们不愿意，他竟敢大发雷霆。社员说：“我们这个食堂就是好，雷也打不散。”你猜那位领导人说什么？“我就是雷公，就是要打散你们！”结果呢，群众第一天分散回去，第二天又照样集合在一起。
    公共食堂本来就是雷也打不散的嘛！
    右倾机会主义分子（如上述那个自以为很高明的领导人）的可悲处，就在于他们看不到运动的主流，他们的脑子里，有保守主义、害怕群众的原虫，一遇机会，便要发作。看到了事物在发展过程中的一些缺点，便惊慌失措，吵嚷不休。而最后倒霉的总是他们自己。
    这里不妨再举个例子来看看。湖北安陆县洑水人民公社永兴生产队的公共食堂，曾经掀起过一场风波。永兴生产队因为食堂搞得太大，不易管理，既浪费了粮食，又浪费了劳动，曾经引起群众不满，要求把食堂划小；但生产队长从此就对食堂的优越性发生了怀疑，觉得办食堂得不偿失，不如散了好。在他的命令下，几个小队的食堂便被迫散伙了。只有一小队队长认为食堂关系着社员的生活和小队的生产，不能说办就办，说散就散，便把问题交给群众讨论。群众说什么也不愿意散，到底坚持着办了下去。过些日子，把办食堂的一小队和不办食堂的二小队比一下，在生产方面，一小队出勤率高，劳动效率高，一个月内，就比二小队多做了七十三分；在生活方面，一小队用粮有节余，伙食费每人每月只二元五角，二小队生活有好有坏，平均每人每月却花伙食费三元多。事实摆得清清楚楚，于是，在自愿的基础上，食堂又纷纷成立起来了。
    这位生产队长虽然没有自比为雷公，但是究其思想本质，同前面说的那位同志是一样的。这类具有右倾保守思想的人，他们同绝大多数的人相反，不是从本质上去看待公共食堂对于解放劳动力和实现家务劳动社会化的重要意义，认识社员归根结蒂是拥护和支持公共食堂的，只是要求改进工作。他们不是力求克服困难，纠正缺点，把食堂办得更好，使新事物能够生根开花。他们走的是另外一条路，那就是强调困难，夸大缺点，在它们面前足酸手软，畏畏缩缩，甚至躺在地上，阻碍群众运动的向前发展。
    在跃进的道路上，只会循着常规走路的人，总是像瞎子一样看不见光明，总是要颠倒黑白、混淆是非的。毛泽东同志就曾经这样谈论过这种人，说“一种新事物出现，他们总是不赞成，首先反对一气。”又说“这种人老是被动，在紧要的关头老是止步不前，老是需要别人在他的背上击一猛掌，才肯向前跨进一步。”那么，就让我们在这种人背上击一掌吧！形势逼人，时不待我，还是赶快认输吧。即使你做了雷公，也永远打不散群众建设社会主义的积极性。只有做温暖和煦的春风，去吹拂滋养那开不败的新的花朵，人民才会向你伸出双手来。
