Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th: Liaoning Province overfulfilled its August production plans for steel, iron, steel products, and coal, as well as railway transportation. Currently, the broad masses of workers on the industrial front throughout the province, building on these excellent achievements, are advancing with victory, striving to create even greater results in September to welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day.

In August, the output of steel, coal, and other systems in the province increased significantly compared to July; among them, steel production increased by 3.9% compared to July, pig iron increased by 2.2%, steel products increased by 7.6%, and coal increased by 5.94%. In addition, the railway system loaded fourteen more cars per day in August than in July. There were also significant improvements in product quality. The qualification rate of electric furnace steel at Dalian Steel Plant increased by 0.47% compared to July, reaching 98.34%, and the qualification rate of converter steel increased by 1.06%, reaching 97.28%; the pig iron qualification rate of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant reached 100% in August, and the No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant reached 99.81%.

Inspired by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, cadres and workers in industrial and mining enterprises throughout Liaoning Province are all in high spirits and full of vigor. The work style of leading cadres has become more in-depth; they have strengthened the specific organization of production, identified problems, and solved them in a timely manner, so that production continues to leap forward. The labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has been unprecedentedly high, and they have launched socialist labor competitions more deeply. After discussion, many enterprises have put forward advanced and practical plans for increasing production and practicing economy. Anshan Iron and Steel workers proposed to complete the state's annual steel production plan ten days ahead of schedule and the state's annual steel products production plan seventeen days ahead of schedule; Benxi Iron and Steel Company also proposed the goal of ensuring an increase of 50,000 tons of pig iron and 10,000 tons of steel products this year. Employees in the province's coal system proposed to complete the state's plan to produce 47 million tons of coal for the year fifteen days ahead of schedule, and to ensure an increase of 2 million tons of coal.

In order to achieve greater success in industrial production in September and provide a reliable guarantee for completing the annual plan, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on September 2 to make specific arrangements for the work of the entire month. The Provincial Party Committee requested all industrial and transportation enterprises to quickly mobilize the masses to discuss and formulate specific measures to ensure the completion of the production increase and economy plan. Party committees at all levels must carefully check the implementation of specific measures, identify problems, and solve them in a timely manner. At the same time, it is necessary to continue to organize cadres to go deep into factories and mining enterprises to help with work, strengthen the ideological leadership and specific organization of the current movement, strengthen production management in combination with the current production movement, and promptly break through the weak links in production. Heavy industry, large-scale industry, raw material and material industries must be firmly grasped. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay close attention to transportation, light industry, people-run industry, repair and service industries. We must continue to vigorously carry out the technical innovation movement and the competition movement of workers, and strengthen the inspection, summarization, evaluation and reward of the competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 5th: Nearly 200,000 workers in more than 230 factories in Nanjing City, inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, are accelerating the speed of the leap forward, determined to greet the tenth anniversary of National Day with the achievement of overfulfilling the third quarter plan.

The production plans of major factories in Nanjing this year have increased significantly compared with the Great Leap Forward of 1958; among them, some have increased by 30%, 50%, 80%, and eight factories, including Fenghuangshan Iron Mine, Huadong Electronic Tube Factory, and Nanjing Gas Factory, have increased by more than doubled. Now the workers in these factories are full of vigor and high morale, full of confidence in completing the annual plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

The Fenghuangshan Iron Mine, whose planned output this year is double that of last year, specifically analyzed the equipment and transportation conditions of each mining area, section, group, and working face, fully studied the favorable conditions for increasing production, and found the key to ensuring the leap forward in production and the weak links that would affect the improvement of production. When the stripping in the mine could not keep up with the needs of mining, they concentrated their efforts to change the stripping disposal site, increased some manual stripping, and implemented mechanical stripping and manual stripping simultaneously to speed up the stripping work. In terms of transportation, the workers improved the railway heads of the hopper openings, increasing from three to five, and adjusted the transportation labor organization, changing from two shifts to three shifts, which rapidly improved transportation efficiency. On this basis, all the workers in the mine re-revised the annual leap forward plan, increasing iron ore production from 950,000 tons to 1,050,000 tons.

The Huadong Electronic Tube Factory completed a total output value of 3.73 times more in the first half of this year than in the same period last year, accounting for 67% of the annual plan. After studying and discussing the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, the workers of this factory immediately responded to the call of the Party with practical actions, determined to break through the planned targets, complete the third quarter plan ahead of schedule and exceed the target, and to ensure that on the basis of the Great Leap Forward, the total output value for the whole year will increase by 2.8 times compared with last year.

After analyzing the favorable conditions in the factory at the workers' congress, the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory decided to increase machine tool production by 12% in September compared with the original plan, increase total output value by 9%, and reduce the processing defect rate by 0.22%. Now, the new leap forward target has become the goal of struggle for each workshop, team, and individual.
