Increase Production and Ensure Harvests: Ideology First
Zhoujia Commune's Dongning Management District Thoroughly Debunks the "Autumn Harvest Grain Loss is Inevitable" Theory

According to the Heilongjiang Daily, the Dongning Management District of Zhoujia People's Commune in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, recently launched a mass debate addressing the biggest ideological problem in past autumn harvests – the theory that autumn harvest grain loss is inevitable – preparing ideologically to do a good job in the autumn harvest.

The field crops in the Dongning Management District are growing well. The masses say, "This year's crops in our management district are: soybean pods are big and fat, stalks are hidden from view (branching from the roots), sorghum ears are big and heavy, bending the stalks, millet grows thick and strong, and corn mostly yields two ears." Seeing such a bountiful harvest, people have been discussing how to harvest it. People who cherish grain are planning how to prevent grain loss, saying, "From spring to summer, a single crop has been touched countless times, each ear and grain is exchanged for sweat, and we absolutely cannot let it be wasted." However, some people believe that "grain should be transported from east to west for consumption," and "in a year of great harvest, losing some is nothing." Even some management district and production team cadres echoed this view, believing that grain loss and waste during the autumn harvest were unavoidable.

In light of these ideological issues, the management district's Party branch immediately raised the question of whether it was possible to avoid wasting grain during the autumn harvest, and organized the masses to debate it. Once the question was raised, people debated it enthusiastically on the threshing floor, in the fields, and at various meetings. Those holding outdated views believed that although the crops were good this year, people's hearts were not united, and some waste during the autumn harvest was inevitable. In particular, this year the crops are growing well, and the ripening time is about the same, so the harvesting work is both urgent and labor-intensive, and there is no way to finish it. You can't be careful no matter how you try. They also cited examples, saying, "In the past, during the small-scale peasant economy, one hectare of land would lose three to five dou of grain by autumn!" So, are people's hearts really not united? Is grain loss really unavoidable? Are today's people's communes the same as the small-scale peasant economy of the past? Some people have different views on these questions. Liu Baohe said, "I agree that people's awareness is high and low, but we must also see that the masses' awareness has improved over the past few years. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, half of our management district has become 'ten-good' commune members; after the establishment of the people's commune, the three-level accounting system was implemented, and everyone understood the policies, so they worked even harder; even if there are some individuals who are worse off, everyone can bring them up." Party member Li Zhi added, "To compare our current people's commune with the small-scale peasant economy of the past is like comparing heaven and earth. In the past, the small-scale peasant economy was just one household, with few people and weak strength. During the autumn harvest, there were many urgent tasks, and it was impossible to harvest carefully. The people's commune has a large population and strong strength, and as long as it is well-organized, there is no difficulty that cannot be solved. We can't always look at the present with old eyes." Cui Hongfu, captain of the first production team, said in the debate, "It also depends on whether we have enough drive. It all depends on human effort. If we have enough drive, we can overcome difficulties and complete the autumn harvest quickly and well. Take last year's autumn harvest in our commune as an example. At that time, everyone was full of energy, working hard and cleverly. As a result, not only did we finish harvesting the crops more than half a month earlier than the previous year, but we also freed up 20 laborers for deep plowing. If we continue to do this this year, we will definitely do a better job in the autumn harvest." As a result, these new views prevailed over the old views.

Rodents, birds, and livestock damaging crops were common occurrences in the past. People who believed that grain loss during the autumn harvest was unavoidable seized on this point and spoke out. They said, "With a good harvest, there is bound to be some loss," and "It is inevitable that rats and birds will eat some grain. It only counts as grain when it is stored in the granary." Is it possible to prevent rats, birds, and livestock from damaging crops during the autumn harvest? Yuan You, an old farmer from the fourth production team, answered this question. He said, "Harvesting crops requires speed and meticulousness. This year, our commune has plenty of manpower and strength, so we will cut and transport sorghum as we go; combine soybean pulling and threshing. The production teams will dig trenches around the threshing grounds, pad the bottom of the stacks with grass, and cover the tops of the stacks with grass; and implement a good livestock management system to ensure that pigs cannot eat it and horses cannot graze it, ensuring a full harvest in a good year, without losing a single grain."

Those with right-leaning conservative ideas also believed that "harvesting crops is a 'rough' job (meaning clumsy and careless), the plan is good, but when you start working, you don't care about anything." This reflects how to adhere to the system, insist on careful inspection, and how the leadership should comprehensively and reasonably arrange work to achieve a fast and meticulous harvest. Li Hai, the captain of the fourth production team, said in answering this question: "Our team plans to mobilize all 90 auxiliary laborers in this year's autumn harvest, which can be converted into 65 full laborers. In this way, each laborer will average less than four hectares of land, which can be harvested as it ripens; then, we will use 10% of the auxiliary laborers to pick up crops, and one person to watch the threshing ground; so that everything is planned, everything is arranged, and we insist on implementing the inspection system, mobilizing the masses to supervise each other, and educating everyone to know the importance of careful and fast harvesting, increasing production and saving grain. In this way, even if you call him 'rough,' he will no longer be 'rough.'"

So, how much grain will be lost in the autumn harvest due to rough operations and untimely harvesting? Some people compared this to dropping a few grains of rice while eating, which is nothing to worry about! But everyone roughly calculated the figures and came to a different conclusion: The total area of field crops in the entire management district this year is 629 hectares. If meticulous harvesting is achieved, compared with the normal autumn harvest, each hectare of soybeans can yield about 360 jin more, sorghum can yield 150 jin more, and millet and corn can each yield 100 jin more. In this way, each hectare can yield an average of nearly 200 jin more, for a total of more than 120,000 jin, which is equivalent to the total output of more than 30 hectares of land, and each labor day can be divided into 1.7 jin more. Commune member Jiang Tiande said: "After calculating this big account, don't think that losing grain is a small matter. This year, we must harvest carefully and bring all the grain home."

After several days of debate, the masses' ideological understanding gradually became clear, and they all believed that as long as they harvested and threshed carefully, took good care of the threshing grounds, and prevented livestock and poultry from damaging the crops, the autumn harvest could be achieved without wasting grain. On this basis, the Party branch led the masses to formulate an autumn harvest production increase and yield protection plan, and put forward the measures of "one early," "three fasts," and "four cleans." "One early" means harvesting early at the right time. Start harvesting when there is no water on the soybean stalks and millet necks, and when the sorghum grains have no white roots, to prevent grain loss from late harvesting; "Three fasts" means fast cutting, fast pulling, and fast threshing, advocating building threshing grounds on the spot to combine cutting, pulling, and threshing; but speed must be combined with meticulousness, and it is necessary to oppose rough work due to speed, resulting in grain loss. To ensure fast and meticulous harvesting, it is required that more than 50% of the population in the entire management district participate in the autumn harvest. At the same time, the canteens should be well-run, and welfare undertakings such as nurseries and kindergartens should be well-run to meet the needs of the autumn harvest. "Four cleans" means clean land, clean threshing grounds, clean roads, and clean stalks. To ensure the implementation of these measures, attention must be paid to technical training, advocating old commune members to train apprentices and exchange harvesting experience; at the same time, an acceptance system should be established, mutual supervision and mutual inspection should be carried out, and acceptance should be carried out in a timely manner. In accordance with this, livestock management and fire prevention conventions should be established to prevent grain loss and ensure the safety of the autumn harvest.

At present, the management district has repaired all the carts, prepared harvesting tools, leveled four large threshing grounds, repaired field roads, made rope loops, prepared food, and started to rectify nurseries and other organizations. The autumn harvest battle has already begun. (Attached picture)

    增产保收　思想先行
    周家公社东宁管理区大破“秋收损失粮食不可避免论”
    据黑龙江日报消息　黑龙江双城县周家人民公社东宁管理区，针对历年秋收工作中的最大思想问题——秋收损失粮食不可避免论，最近开展了一次全民性的大辩论，从思想上为搞好秋收作了准备。
    东宁管理区大田作物生育良好，群众说：“我们管理区今年的庄稼是：豆荚肥大秸没脚（从根部就分杈），高粱穗大压弯腰，谷子长的粗又壮，苞米多是两个棒。”看到这样的丰收景象，前些天，社员就议论如何收秋。珍惜粮食的人们在计划着如何防止损失粮食，他们说：“由春到夏，一棵庄稼不知道经过了多少遍手，一个穗、一个粒都是用汗珠换来的，绝对不能让它白白地丢掉。”可是也有一部分人认为：“东粮西舍”，“大收之年，损失一些不算什么。”甚至有些管理区和生产队干部，也附和着这种说法，认为秋收中损失浪费粮食是不可避免的事情。
    管理区党支部根据这些思想情况，立即提出了在秋收中能不能做到避免糟踏粮食这样一个问题，组织群众展开辩论。问题一经提出，人们便在打麦场上、在田间、在各种各样的会议上，纷纷地辩论起来了。持有陈旧观点的人认为：今年的庄稼好，就是人心不齐，秋收的时候糟损一些是免不了的。特别是今年庄稼长的好，成熟时间前后差不多，收割工作既催手又费工，怎样也干不过来。想细也细不了。他们还举例说：“过去小农经济的时候，那一公顷地到秋天不得糟损个三斗、五斗的！”那么，人心究竟齐不齐？粮食损失是不是一定不可避免？现在的人民公社和过去的小农经济是否相同？对这些问题另外一些人有着不同的看法。刘宝和说：“若说人的觉悟有高有低这我同意，可是也得看到，几年来群众觉悟都有提高。去年大跃进以来，咱们管理区光十好社员就有一半；人民公社成立后，实行了三级核算，大家对政策摸了底，干的就更有劲；就是有个别人差一些，大家也能把他带起来了。”党员李之接着说：“要把现在咱们的人民公社和过去的小农经济相比，可是一个天上、一个地下了。过去的小农经济是一家一户，人少力弱，秋收期间的活计是又多又急，想细收也细不了；人民公社是人多力大，只要组织得好，没有解决不了的困难。不能总是用旧眼光看现在。”第一生产队长崔洪福在辩论中说：“还要看我们干劲足不足，事在人为。我们干劲足，就能克服困难，又快又好地完成秋收任务。就拿去年咱们公社的秋收工作来说，那时大家干劲冲天，苦干巧干，结果不但比前年提前半个多月收完了庄稼，还抽出二十个劳动力深翻地。今年要再继续这样干，一定会把秋收工作搞的更好。”结果还是这些新看法说倒了前面的旧看法。
    鼠雀和牲畜祸害庄稼，在过去是屡见不鲜的事情。认为秋收中损失粮食是不可避免的，人们又抓住这一点发言了。他们说：“丰收丰收，必有一丢”，“鼠咬雀吃免不了，收到囤里才算粮”。秋收中能不能避免鼠、雀、牲畜祸害庄稼呢？第四生产队老农袁有回答了这个问题。他说：“收庄稼一个是快，一个是细。今年咱公社人手多、力量足，高粱随割随拉；大豆拉打结合。生产队都挖场院壕，垛底用草垫、垛尖用草盖；再执行好牲畜看管制度，就一定能做到猪吃不着，马啃不着，保证十成年景十成收，一粒也不丢。”
    持有右倾保守思想的人还认为：“收割庄稼是‘毛楞’活（大手大足的意思），计划挺好，干起来就什么都不顾了。”这反映着如何坚持制度、坚持认真检查和领导上如何全面合理安排活计，做到快收细收的问题。第四生产队队长李海在回答这个问题时说：“我们队计划在今年秋收中把九十个辅助劳动力都发动起来，可折成六十五个整劳动力。这样每个劳动力平均不到四公顷地，可做到随熟随收；然后再用10％的辅助劳动力拣庄稼，用一个人看场院；做到事事有计划，处处安排好，坚持执行检查制度，发动群众互相监督，教育大家都知道细收快收、增产节约粮食的重要意义。这样，你就叫他‘毛楞’他也不再‘毛楞’了。”
    那么，秋收中因为作业粗糙、收获不适时等原因会损失多少粮食呢？一部分人把这比喻为吃饭掉几个饭粒，没什么了不起，用不着大惊小怪！可是大家粗略地算了一笔账，却得出不同的结论：全管理区今年的大田作物是六百二十九公顷，如果做到细致收割，和常年的秋收比较，每公顷大豆约可多收三百六十斤，高粱多收一百五十斤，谷子、苞米各可多收一百斤，这样平均每公顷即可多收近二百斤，总计起来就是十二万多斤，等于三十多公顷地的总产量，平均每个劳动日可多分一斤七两。社员姜天德说：“算了这笔大账，再也别认为损失粮食是小事了。今年说什么也得细点收，把粮食全部收到家。”
    经过几天来的辩论，群众的思想认识逐渐明确，都认为只要细收细打，看护好场院，避免牲畜、家禽祸害，秋收完全可以做到不糟踏粮食。在这个基础上，党支部领导群众制订了秋收增产保收计划，提出了“一早”“三快”“四净”的措施。“一早”是要适时早割，大豆秸和谷子脖上没水、高粱粒没有白根的时候就要动手割，防止晚割掉粒；“三快”是快割、快拉、快打，提倡就地建场院，做到割拉打结合；但是快中必须有细，反对因快就粗糙以致损失粮食的作法。为保证做到快收细收，要求全管理区占人口50％以上的人参加秋收。同时把食堂办好，将托儿所、幼儿园等福利事业办好，适应秋收需要。“四净”是要作到地净、场净、道路净、秸棵打净。为了保证这些措施的兑现，必须注意技术训练，提倡老社员带好徒弟，交流收割经验；同时建立验收制度，互相监督、互相检查、及时验收。与此相适应地建立牲畜看管、防火等公约，以防止损失粮食和确保秋收安全。
    目前，这个管理区已经将全部大车修理好，准备好了收割工具，平出了四个大场院，修好了田间道路，打好了绳套，准备了食粮，已着手整顿托儿所等组织，秋收大战已经揭开。（附图片）
