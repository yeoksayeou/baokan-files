Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 7th: On the eve of the fifteenth anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day, many outstanding members of the Dimitrov Communist Youth League were honorably accepted as members of the Bulgarian Communist Party. According to preliminary statistics from the Central Committee of the Dimitrov Communist Youth League, as of September 4th, party organizations in the three districts of Gabrovo, Yambol, and Silistra alone had successively accepted 393 new party members.

In order to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party decided in July this year to accept a group of outstanding Communist Youth League members into the Party before the holiday, in order to expand the ranks of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which is the leader, organizer, and inspirer of Bulgaria's revolutionary victory and socialist construction. After the resolution was announced, a large number of Communist Youth League members submitted applications to join the Party.

The work of accepting party members in various regions is being carried out very seriously and meticulously. First, the grassroots organizations of the League hold general meetings of all League members to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the League members who have submitted applications to join the Party one by one. Finally, the outstanding League members recognized by everyone are introduced to the Party organization. Then, the Party organization individually admits those League members who meet the requirements into the Party.

    保共在保加利亚国庆前夕
    接受许多优秀团员入党
    据新华社索非亚7日电　在保加利亚国庆十五周年前夕，季米特洛夫共青团的许多优秀团员光荣地被接受为保加利亚共产党党员。据季米特洛夫共青团中央初步统计，到9月4日为止，仅加布罗沃、亚姆波尔和西利斯特拉三个州的党组织就先后接受了三百九十三名新党员。
    为了迎接保加利亚国庆十五周年，今年7月，保共中央决定在节日前接受一批优秀共青团员入党，以扩大作为保加利亚革命胜利和社会主义建设的领导者、组织者和鼓舞者——保加利亚共产党的队伍。这一决议公布后，广大共青团员们纷纷提出入党申请。
    各地接受党员的工作进行得十分认真和细致。首先，由团的基层组织举行全体团员会议，逐个讨论提出入党申请的团员的优缺点，最后把大家公认的优秀团员介绍给党组织。然后，党组织再把那些够条件的团员个别吸收入党。
