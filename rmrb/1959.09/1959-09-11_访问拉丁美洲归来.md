Returning from a Visit to Latin America
Chinese Journalist Delegation: Yao Zhen, Chang Zhiqing, Gao Ji

At the invitation of the Chilean Journalists Association, the Chinese Journalist Delegation visited Chile in mid-May and later made friendly visits to Uruguay, Brazil, and Cuba. From our arrival in Santiago, the capital of Chile, on May 14th to our departure from Havana on July 28th, we spent nearly eighty days of enthusiastic and busy life in Latin America.

During our visits to these countries, we were warmly received by people from all walks of life. We had extensive contact with people from various fields, including journalism, culture, education, economics, and politics. We conveyed to them the friendly wishes of the Chinese people for the people of Latin American countries. We established contacts with the journalists' associations or journalist unions in these countries, and on behalf of the All-China Journalists Association, we exchanged documents with the Uruguayan and Brazilian journalist organizations to strengthen friendly exchanges between the journalist organizations of the two countries. We visited factories, plantations, and agricultural cooperatives in Cuba, and visited the homes of workers and farmers. We also had contact with officials in these countries, who received us in a friendly manner and provided assistance in our visits. For example, thanks to the arrangements made by the Information Bureau of the Chilean Presidential Palace, we visited Chile's famous underground copper mine, Sewell Copper Mine. We were also invited by the Brazilian new capital construction company to visit Brasilia, the new capital of Brazil under construction. In Cuba, the central and Havana provincial leadership of the "July 26th Movement" gave enthusiastic support and assistance to our visit; several military and political leaders personally received us; and we were also invited to participate in the July 26th military parade and the grand mass rally.

Our friendly visits to Latin American countries were quite successful, and we must first deeply thank our friends in these countries. They regarded us as their closest friends. This noble friendship, of course, is not only for a few of us, but primarily for the great People's Republic of China and the 650 million Chinese people. This precious friendship is something we will never forget.

During our friendly visit, Latin America was at a very important moment.

In the past two years, the tide of Latin American peoples' struggles against U.S. imperialism, for the defense of national independence, and for democracy has been very high. We once used the phrase "fires everywhere in America's backyard" to vividly depict this new situation in Latin America. The victory of the Cuban people's armed struggle against dictatorial rule was a great event that occurred in this new situation. The U.S. imperialists, who are running into walls everywhere and becoming increasingly isolated in the world, are even more exasperated in the face of this situation.

Of course, U.S. imperialism, the common enemy of the people of the world, will never give up. On the contrary, it has intensified its neo-colonialist and heinous aggression against Latin American countries. Since this spring, U.S. imperialism has been using its political, economic, and military power to vigorously consolidate the dictatorial regimes of some countries—the pillars of U.S. neo-colonial rule—or exerting pressure on the governments of some countries. Through its agents in Latin American countries and the reactionaries of these countries, it is launching fierce attacks on the national and democratic forces under the guise of anti-Soviet and anti-communist clamor. Along the Caribbean coast, it is even more targeting the Cuban revolutionary government and the Cuban people, attempting to form a counter-revolutionary encirclement of Cuba and implement a combined attack from inside and outside.

Before we entered the Latin American continent, the sky over this continent seemed to be covered with dark clouds, giving the impression that the city was about to be destroyed. The Frondizi government of Argentina accepted the harsh conditions of the "International Monetary Fund" under the name of the so-called "economic stabilization plan" and became increasingly reactionary in politics. During our stay in Uruguay, we heard the news that many patriotic and democratic organizations in Argentina had been closed down, and the white terror implemented by the Frondizi government seemed to have reached its peak. In the Uruguayan Council of State, some people even clamored for the passage of a reactionary proposal to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In Cuba, the reactionary forces colluding with U.S. imperialism, opposing land reform, and preventing the people's revolution from continuing to move forward were also rampant. This black wind was truly pressing.

However, this is only one aspect of the matter. There is another, more important aspect: whether it is these countries or other countries in Latin America, the national democratic struggle is developing. Is it the U.S. imperialists and the reactionaries of some countries who have the power? Or is it the national democratic revolutionary forces of Latin American countries that have the power? After we entered Latin America, countless facts gave us the answer. The national democratic revolution in Latin American countries is advancing, and no force can stop it. Just as U.S. imperialism was tightening its "sinister black hand" to strangle the necks of the peoples of Latin American countries, we heard good news from Brazil, the largest country in Latin America. Amid the rising calls of the Brazilian people to defend national independence and demand the development of the national economy, the Kubitschek government stopped loan negotiations with the "International Monetary Fund." This news further inspired the confidence and courage of the Brazilian people and the peoples of other Latin American countries in their struggles. Immediately afterward, news came from Cuba, the center of the Latin American revolutionary storm, that Agramonte, the former Cuban foreign minister and U.S. agent, had been dismissed. On the eve of our departure from Uruguay, members of many political parties jointly issued statements in newspapers opposing the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and demanding that the government take further measures to improve relations with socialist countries. Demanding the development of trade relations with socialist countries and getting rid of the increasingly deteriorating living conditions due to long-term U.S. economic control is the common cry of the broad masses of people in Uruguay. The black wind stirred up by U.S. imperialism and its agents in Latin American countries to suppress the national democratic struggles of the peoples of various countries has aroused increasingly strong anti-American and patriotic sentiments among the peoples of various countries. The tide of national democratic struggles of the peoples of Latin American countries is continuing to develop irresistibly.

When we arrived in Brazil, the anti-American sentiment for defending national independence and developing the national economy was very strong. People from all walks of life in Brazil unanimously supported President Kubitschek's decisive actions to defend national independence and demanded that trade be conducted with socialist countries in order to develop the national economy and get rid of dependence on the United States. In the Federal Assembly, we heard a Labor Party member strongly condemn the participation of U.S. military personnel in secret meetings of the Brazilian Supreme Military Academy, which damaged Brazilian sovereignty. This enthusiastic speech was supported by the majority of people in the Assembly. In our contacts with people from all walks of life in Brazil, we also heard more than once the call for land reform in order to realize the country's industrialization in Brazil and put the national economy on the road to independent development. After World War II, Brazil's industry developed relatively rapidly. At present, the industrial output value accounts for about 40% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. There are 2.2 million industrial workers in the country. However, U.S. monopoly capital desperately lowered the price of coffee, Brazil's main export commodity, which made Brazil's deficit in international payments increasingly large, causing serious difficulties in Brazil's national industrialization. On the other hand, U.S. monopoly capital and its agents in Brazil, in order to continue to control and hinder Brazil's economic development, tried their best to maintain the large plantation system and the deformed economy of single crops in Brazil's rural areas, thereby causing bankruptcy in Brazil's rural areas, long-term stagnation in agricultural production, and extreme poverty in the lives of farmers. All these practices of U.S. imperialism have increasingly deepened its contradictions with the broad masses of people in Brazil. The national and democratic struggle of the Brazilian people is constantly rising.

We left Brazil and arrived in Cuba. This is a new world in Latin America. The Cuban military and civilians are high-spirited and determined to consolidate and develop the victory of the revolution. In Cuba, everything is booming, full of energy, full of struggle, and full of hope. The Cuban people, who have gone through a long-term, mass-based, armed revolutionary struggle, have stood up. Imperialist aggressors can no longer enslave them. The Cuban people's revolutionary struggle is like the surging waves of the Caribbean Sea, one wave higher than another. We saw with our own eyes that after the current Air Force Commander Díaz Lanz was dismissed, he fled to Washington's embrace, openly revealed his traitorous face, and performed a treasonous farce on U.S. television. This incident further angered the Cuban military and civilians. The roar of opposition to U.S. interference in Cuba's internal affairs and denunciation of revolutionary traitors resounded from the cities to the countryside. The news that the U.S. pawns in the Dominican Republic and the Batista elements who fled abroad were preparing to invade with weapons under the instigation of the United States was like adding fuel to the fire for the indignant Cuban military and civilians. Of course, the enemies inside and outside Cuba have not restrained themselves because of this. Urrutia, in his capacity as president, hurriedly published anti-communist clamors in the newspaper, not hesitating to openly break with Prime Minister Castro. For those few days, this boiling island country seemed to be in the eve of a storm. However, the Cuban people finally won a new victory in this revolutionary storm. On July 17, the masses surrounded the presidential palace and ousted Urrutia. Under the leadership of Castro, the Cuban military and civilians eliminated their internal tumors one by one, giving a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary forces supported by U.S. imperialism.

The powerful demonstration of millions of people held in Havana on July 26 is a vivid symbol of the Cuban people's struggle to defend national independence and the continued rise of the people's democratic revolution. The Cuban revolutionary government and people from all walks of life conducted extensive mobilization and organization work throughout the country in order to hold this conference. Five hundred thousand farmers, carrying their traditional weapons of production and combat—machetes—came to Havana from all over the country and were warmly received and welcomed by the citizens of Havana. In those few days, Havana was full of farmers' gatherings, and the roar of defending land reform and opposing foreign interference was everywhere. It was simply an ocean of revolutionary enthusiasm. On July 26, in Havana's Civic Square, 500,000 farmers and hundreds of thousands of Havana citizens raised their shining machetes and issued cheers that shook the earth and the sea, expressing their determination to defend the revolution and carry out land reform to the end. The slogan of the Cuban farmers is: "When Cuba is invaded, we farmers are the best reserve force of the revolutionary army." This firm revolutionary will and heroic spirit of the Cuban people still excites our hearts. The revolutionary leaders and people from all walks of life in Cuba have repeatedly told us that they are soberly aware that there are still dangerous enemies on the road of the Cuban revolution, and they must continue to carry out arduous struggles, but they are fearless and determined to continue to move forward along the revolutionary road. Indeed, the pace of the Cuban people who have stood up cannot be stopped by any reactionary force in the world.

The Cuban people's revolutionary struggle has attracted the attention of the people of all Latin American countries. When we visited other countries in Latin America, we heard sympathy and praise for the Cuban revolution everywhere. During our visit to Cuba, many political and public leaders from Latin American countries, as well as friends from the press, also came to Cuba to visit. They all said that the Cuban revolution, especially the land reform movement, gave them great encouragement. The representatives of various Latin American countries who participated in the Cuban land reform forum unanimously agreed in their speeches that the Cuban revolution set a brilliant example for the people of all Latin American countries and would definitely bring far-reaching influence to the national democratic movement of the people of all Latin American countries.

From Chile to Uruguay, to Brazil, to Cuba, we have seen that the people of Latin American countries are waging a resolute struggle to defend national independence and strive for democracy. This is the main trend in the current situation in Latin America. We see very clearly that the U.S.'s long-term colonial rule over Latin America has been fundamentally shaken, and the era when U.S. imperialism can control Latin America as it pleases is gone forever. Although U.S. imperialism still has considerable power, it is the people who have risen to struggle, not U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, who determine the fate of Latin America.

The people of Latin America, who love independence, freedom, and peace, are very friendly to the Chinese people. They are very fond of Chinese art and culture. The Chinese Peking Opera Troupe and Acrobatic Troupe have left a very deep impression wherever they have gone. When we visited a member of the Uruguayan Council of State, this old man of nearly seventy years old hoped that China could send some handicraft masters to pass on their skills to his country. The people of Latin American countries believe that the Chinese people are a diligent, brave, and noble people. People from all walks of life in Cuba told us in unison that during the Cuban War of Independence in the last century, a large number of overseas Chinese participated in this war, and their blood had long been mixed with the blood of the Cuban people. The Chinese people have long experienced the same fate as them, and are still waging a resolute struggle against the common enemy of the people of all countries in the world, and also the common enemy of the people of all Latin American countries—U.S. imperialism. Cubans like to use such a sentence to express their friendship with the new China to us: "You overthrew Chiang Kai-shek, and we overthrew Batista." Indeed, our destinies and our struggles have many things in common. Asia, Africa, and Latin America are all promising. The darkness has already passed or is passing, and in front of us is an infinitely beautiful tomorrow.

The people of Latin American countries have a high degree of trust in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and they believe that socialist countries are their most reliable friends. The universal desire of the people of Latin American countries is to further strengthen economic and cultural exchanges with socialist countries and with the new China. The people of various countries urgently hope to further understand the new China. When we visited workers and farmers in various countries, they repeatedly expressed their desire for China to send worker delegations and farmer delegations to visit them.

We have brought back the friendship of the people of Latin American countries. During our visit to these countries, we were entrusted by workers, farmers, young people, and women, and entrusted by people from all walks of life, including journalism, culture, education, economics, and politics, to send their greetings to the Chinese people on their behalf. They congratulated the Chinese people on their greater victories in building their own country and defending world peace.

From this friendly visit, we are even more convinced that the progress of the people of Latin American countries is unstoppable, and the friendly development of the people of Latin American countries and the Chinese people is unstoppable. We have now returned from far away Latin America to our great motherland, but our hearts will always remember our friends in Latin America who are fighting heroically, and will always remember and pay attention to the people of Latin American countries. Moreover, we firmly believe that the people of Latin American countries will have an extremely beautiful and happy future. We wish the national democratic movement of Latin American countries new and great victories! We wish the people of Latin American countries a bright future and a happy life! (Attached picture)

    访问拉丁美洲归来
    中国新闻工作者代表团　姚溱　常芝青　高集
    中国新闻工作者代表团应智利记者协会的邀请，于5月中旬到智利进行访问，后来又到乌拉圭、巴西和古巴等国家进行了友好访问。从5月14日到达智利的首都圣地亚哥，到7月28日离开哈瓦那为止，我们在拉丁美洲总共度过了将近八十天热烈而紧张的生活。
    我们在上述国家访问期间，受到了各界人士的亲切接待。我们同这些国家的新闻、文教、经济和政治等各界人士进行了广泛接触，我们向他们转达了中国人民对于拉丁美洲各国人民的友好的祝愿。我们同这些国家的记者协会或记者工会建立了联系，并且代表中华全国新闻工作者协会同乌拉圭、巴西的记者组织互换了加强两国记者组织之间友好往来的文件。我们参观访问了这些国家的工厂、庄园和古巴的农业合作社，访问了工人和农民的家庭。我们还同这些国家的官方人士进行了接触和联系，并且受到他们友好的接待和在参观访问方面的帮助。例如，由于智利总统府情报局的安排，我们参观了智利著名的地下铜矿——塞威尔铜矿；我们还应巴西新首都建筑公司的邀请，访问了正在兴建中的巴西新首都——巴西里亚。在古巴，“七月二十六日运动”中央和哈瓦那省的领导机构，对于我们的访问工作给予热情支持和多方协助；好些军政领袖亲自接见了我们；还邀请我们参加了7月26日的阅兵大典和百万群众的盛大集会示威。
    我们对拉丁美洲国家的友好访问进行得相当圆满，首先要深深地感谢这些国家的朋友们。他们把我们看做最亲密的朋友。他们这种崇高的友谊，当然不仅是对于我们几个人的，而首先是对于伟大的中华人民共和国和六亿五千万中国人民的。这种珍贵的友谊，是我们久久不能忘怀的。
    在我们这次友好访问期间，拉丁美洲正处在一个非常重要的时刻。
    过去两年以来，拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义、维护民族独立、争取民主的斗争浪潮，非常高涨。我们曾经用“美国后院到处着火”的辞句，形象地描绘出拉丁美洲这一新形势。古巴人民反对独裁统治的武装斗争的胜利，是在这个新形势中发生的伟大事件。在全世界到处碰壁、日益陷于孤立的美帝国主义者，面对这一形势，更是焦头烂额。
    当然，美帝国主义这个世界人民的共同敌人，是决不会就此罢休的。相反地，它更加加紧了对于拉丁美洲各国的新殖民主义的万恶侵略。今春以来，美帝国主义运用它政治的、经济的以及军事的力量，大力巩固某些国家的独裁政权——美国新殖民主义统治的支柱，或者对某些国家政府施展压力，通过它在拉丁美洲各国的代理人和这些国家的反动派，以反苏反共叫嚣为烟幕，向各国民族民主力量猛烈进攻；在加勒比海沿岸，更把锋芒针对着古巴革命政府和古巴人民，企图形成对古巴的反革命包围，实行内外夹攻。
    当我们进入拉丁美洲大陆以前，这个大陆的上空，确似黑云密布，大有乌云压城城欲摧之感。阿根廷弗朗迪西政府，在所谓“经济稳定计划”的名义下接受了“国际货币基金组织”的苛刻条件，在政治上日趋反动。我们在乌拉圭期间，更传来了阿根廷许多爱国民主团体被封闭的消息，弗朗迪西政府实行白色恐怖，似乎发展到登峰造极的地步。在乌拉圭国务会议中，也有人叫嚷着要通过与苏联断绝邦交的反动提案。在古巴，勾结美帝国主义、反对实行土地改革、阻止人民革命继续向前发展的反动势力，也很嚣张。这股黑风，真是咄咄逼人。
    然而，这只是事情的一方面。还有另一个方面，更重要的一方面，不论是这些国家，或者拉丁美洲其他国家，民族民主斗争都在发展。究竟是美帝国主义和一些国家的反动派有力量呢？还是拉丁美洲国家的民族民主革命势力有力量呢？当我们进入拉丁美洲以后，无数的事实，给我们作了答案。拉丁美洲各国的民族民主革命在前进，这是没有任何力量可以阻挡的。就在美帝国主义把它“罪恶的黑手”加紧扼住拉丁美洲各国人民脖子的时候，我们听到了拉丁美洲最大的国家——巴西传来了喜讯。库比契克政府，在巴西人民维护民族独立、要求发展民族经济的日益高涨的呼声中，停止了同“国际货币基金组织”的贷款谈判。这个消息，进一步鼓舞了巴西人民和拉丁美洲其他各国人民的斗争信心和勇气。紧接着，从拉丁美洲革命风暴的中心——古巴，又传来了阿格拉蒙特这个前古巴外交部长、美国代理人被撤职的消息。当我们离开乌拉圭的前夕，许多政党的议员，在报纸上联名发表申明，反对和苏联断绝邦交，并且要求政府采取进一步的措施改善同社会主义国家的关系。要求发展同社会主义国家的贸易往来，摆脱由于美国在经济上的长期控制而日益恶化的生活困境，这是乌拉圭广大阶层的人民的共同呼声。美帝国主义和它在拉丁美洲各国的代理人为压制各国人民民族民主斗争而刮起的黑风，激起了各国人民越来越强烈的反美爱国情绪。拉丁美洲各国人民民族民主斗争的浪潮，正在不可遏止地继续向前发展着。
    我们到达巴西时，为维护民族独立和发展民族经济而斗争的反美情绪十分强烈。巴西各界人士一致支持库比契克总统为维护民族独立而采取的果断行动，并且要求为发展民族经济、摆脱对美国的依赖而同社会主义国家进行贸易。在联邦议会中，我们听到一位工党议员强烈谴责美国军事人员参与巴西最高军事学院秘密会议、损害巴西主权的行为，这个热情演说得到了议会中多数人的支持。在我们同巴西各界人士的接触中，我们也不止一次地听到，为了在巴西实现国家的工业化和使民族经济走上独立发展的道路，必须实行土地改革的呼声。第二次世界大战以后，巴西工业有了比较迅速的发展。目前，在工农业生产总值中，工业产值已达40％左右。全国有产业工人二百二十万人。可是美国垄断资本拼命压低巴西主要出口物资咖啡的价格，使巴西国际收支的逆差日益增大，造成了巴西国家工业化的严重困难。另一方面，美国垄断资本和它在巴西的代理人，为了继续控制和阻碍巴西的经济发展，竭力维持巴西农村中的大庄园制和单一作物的畸形经济，从而造成了巴西农村破产，农业生产长期停滞不前和农民生活极端贫困的局面。美帝国主义的这一切做法，日益加深了它与巴西广大阶层人民的矛盾。巴西人民民族民主的斗争正在不断高涨中。
    我们离开巴西到达古巴。这是拉丁美洲的一个新天地。古巴军民斗志昂扬，他们坚决地要求巩固和发展革命的胜利。在古巴，一切都是蓬蓬勃勃的，充满着干劲，充满着斗争，也充满着希望。经过长期的、群众性的、武装革命斗争的古巴人民，已经站起来了。帝国主义侵略者再也不能奴役他们了。古巴人民的革命斗争，有如汹涌澎湃的加勒比海的浪潮，一浪高过一浪。我们亲眼看到，当前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯被撤职之后，逃往华盛顿怀抱，公开叛徒面孔，在美国电视台大演叛国丑剧，这件事更加激怒了古巴军民。反对美国干涉古巴内政、痛斥革命叛徒的吼声，从城市响彻农村。多米尼加的美国爪牙、逃亡国外的巴蒂斯塔分子，在美国策动下准备武装进犯的消息，对群情激愤的古巴军民，更不啻是火上加油。当然，古巴国内外的敌人并没有因此收敛。乌鲁蒂亚以总统身份，又急忙在报上发表反共叫嚣，不惜公开同卡斯特罗总理决裂。有那末几天，在这个沸腾的岛国，确像处在暴风雨的前夕。但是，古巴人民终于在这场革命风暴中，取得了一次新的胜利。7月17日群众包围总统府，驱逐乌鲁蒂亚下台。古巴军民在卡斯特罗的领导之下，把他们内部的毒瘤，一个一个地加以铲除，给美帝国主义所支持的反革命势力以一次沉重的打击。
    7月26日在哈瓦那举行的百万群众的强大示威，是古巴人民维护民族独立的斗争和人民民主革命运动继续走向高涨的生动的标志。古巴革命政府和各界人民为了举行这次大会，曾在全国各地进行了广泛的动员和组织工作。五十万农民带着他们传统的生产和战斗的武器——砍刀，从全国各地来到哈瓦那，受到哈瓦那市民的热情接待和欢迎。那几天的哈瓦那，到处是农民集会，到处是保卫土地改革、反对外国干涉的吼声，简直是一个革命热情沸腾不息的海洋。7月26日在哈瓦那的公民广场上，五十万农民和数十万哈瓦那市民，高举起闪闪发光的砍刀，发出震响大地和海洋的欢呼，表示他们保卫革命和把土地改革进行到底的决心。古巴农民的口号是：“在古巴遭受侵略时，我们农民是革命军最好的后备队”。古巴人民的这种坚定的革命意志和英雄气概，直至现在还激动着我们的心。古巴的革命领导者和各界人士，一再告诉我们，他们清醒地知道，在古巴革命的道路上还有着凶险的敌人，他们还必须进行艰苦的斗争，但是他们毫无畏惧，决心沿着革命的道路继续前进。的确，已经站起来了的古巴人民的前进的步伐，是世界任何反动力量都无法阻挡的。
    古巴人民的革命斗争吸引着拉丁美洲各国人民的注视。我们在拉丁美洲的其他国家进行访问时，到处都听到对古巴革命的同情和赞扬。当我们在古巴访问期间，拉丁美洲各国的许多政界和公众领袖，以及新闻界的朋友们，也纷纷到古巴参观和访问。他们都表示，古巴的革命，特别是土地改革运动给他们以巨大的鼓舞。参加古巴土地改革论坛的拉丁美洲的各国代表，在发言中一致认为古巴的革命为拉丁美洲各国人民做出了光辉的榜样，一定会给拉丁美洲各国人民民族民主运动带来深远的影响。
    从智利到乌拉圭，到巴西，到古巴，我们都看到拉丁美洲国家人民为维护民族独立和争取民主进行着坚决的斗争。这是拉丁美洲当前局势中的主流。我们非常明显地看到，美国对拉丁美洲长期的殖民主义统治，是根本动摇了，美帝国主义任所欲为地控制拉丁美洲的时代，已经一去不复返了。尽管美帝国主义还有相当的力量，但决定拉丁美洲命运的，是已经起来进行斗争的人民而不是美帝国主义和各国的反动派。
    热爱独立、自由与和平的拉丁美洲的人民，对中国人民十分友好。他们十分喜爱中国的艺术和文化。中国京剧团、杂技团所到之处，都留下了极为深刻的印象。当我们访问乌拉圭一位国务委员的时候，这位将近七十岁的老人，希望中国能派一些手工艺师去，把技术传授给他的国家，拉丁美洲国家的人民认为中国人民是勤劳、勇敢和具有高贵品质的人民。古巴各界人士，异口同声地告诉我们，在上世纪古巴独立战争中，大批华侨参加了这个战争，他们的鲜血早已同古巴人民的鲜血流在一起。中国人民长期经历过同他们一样的命运，直到现在还为反对世界各国人民的共同敌人，也是拉丁美洲各国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义进行着坚决的斗争。古巴人很喜欢用这样一句话向我们表达对新中国的友情：“你们打倒了蒋介石，我们打倒了巴蒂斯塔”。的确，我们的命运，我们的斗争，很多是相同的。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲都是有希望的，黑暗已经或者正在过去，在我们的前面，呈现着无限美好的明天。
    拉丁美洲各国人民对于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营有着崇高的信任，他们认为社会主义国家是他们最可靠的朋友。渴望同社会主义国家、同新中国进一步加强经济和文化的往来，是拉丁美洲国家人民的普遍愿望。各国人民迫切地希望进一步了解新中国，当我们在各国访问工人、农民的时候，他们一再表示要中国能够派遣工人代表团、农民代表团访问他们。
    我们带回了拉丁美洲各国人民的友谊。我们在访问这些国家的过程中，受到过工人、农民、青年、妇女们的委托，受到过新闻、文教、经济和政治等各界人士的委托，要我们代他们向中国人民问好，他们祝贺中国人民在建设自己的祖国和保卫世界和平中取得更大的胜利。
    我们从这次友好访问中，更加深信，拉丁美洲各国人民的前进是不可阻挡的，拉丁美洲各国人民同中国人民的友好发展是不可阻挡的。我们现在已经从遥远的拉丁美洲回到我们伟大的祖国了，但是我们的心，永远记挂着英勇斗争中的拉丁美洲的朋友们，永远怀念着、关注着拉丁美洲国家的人民。而且，我们坚信，拉丁美洲各国的人民一定会有一个极其美好幸福的未来。祝拉丁美洲各国民族民主运动获得新的伟大胜利！祝拉丁美洲各国人民前途光明、生活幸福！（附图片）
