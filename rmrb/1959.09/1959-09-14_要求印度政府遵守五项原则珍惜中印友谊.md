    Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Continues Discussion on the Sino-Indian Border Issue
    Demand the Indian Government Abide by the Five Principles and Cherish Sino-Indian Friendship
    Western Imperialist Forces and Their Agents in India Are Attempting to Use the Sino-Indian Border Incident to Undermine Sino-Indian Friendship and Change India's Peaceful and Neutral Foreign Policy; Hope the Indian People Overcome This Vicious Conspiracy
    The Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress held its enlarged eighth meeting this morning to continue discussing the Sino-Indian border issue. Those who spoke and submitted written statements at the meeting unanimously and firmly supported the solemn stance, clear attitude, and correct principles held by our government regarding the resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue. They demanded that the Indian government prioritize Sino-Indian friendship, immediately cease anti-China activities, withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who have crossed the border, and resolve the Sino-Indian border issue through peaceful negotiations.
    If the Indian Government's Erroneous Policy Continues, It Will Certainly Provide an Opportunity for Imperialism, and the Indian Government and People Should Be Highly Vigilant
    Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, in his speech, sternly refuted a series of statements made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the Sino-Indian border issue that harmed Sino-Indian friendship. He expressed immense indignation at the malicious attacks on China by Indian expansionists who were encouraged by the Indian government. He strongly stated that if the Indian government's erroneous policy continues, "it will certainly provide an opportunity for imperialism," and he demanded that the Indian government and people be "highly vigilant."

    Lin Feng said that although China has always valued Sino-Indian friendship and shown great restraint and patience regarding border incidents, Prime Minister Nehru, as one of the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and understanding the actual situation on the Sino-Indian border, has repeatedly made very unfriendly remarks about China. Lin Feng pointed out that Nehru has repeatedly claimed that Chinese troops "invaded" Indian territory and said, "This is a clear act of aggression." This is a completely "unreasonable and distorted" attack. Especially in his speech to the Indian Council of States on September 10, Nehru actually defended British imperialism, insidiously accused China of being "Chinese imperialism," and depicted China as an arrogant and conceited country that "treats [India] casually and attempts to intimidate" it.

    Lin Feng said indignantly: "Prime Minister Nehru, who has always prided himself on respecting facts, has actually made completely false statements, which is truly regrettable."

    Lin Feng also refuted Nehru's strange views expressed in the Council of States, which seemed to suggest that there was no common political language between Chinese and Indians. Lin Feng said that whether it is the 650 million Chinese people or the 400 million Indian people, both know that although the people of China and India use different national languages and scripts, we have a full common language in handling mutual relations and friendly cooperation. If things were really as Prime Minister Nehru said, and there was no common language between our two countries, then how could our two countries have jointly created the world-renowned Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence?

    He said that if Chinese characters, as Nehru said, would change their original meaning when translated into German, English, and other languages, then how could all those enthusiastic people in China and India who promote Sino-Indian friendship establish and exchange their feelings and friendship? How was the cultural exchange between China and India, which has been developing since the Han Dynasty and especially since the Tang Dynasty, realized? Obviously, it is absurd to say that there is no common language between China and India.

    He pointed out that this kind of absurd argument will never be welcomed by the vast number of people who advocate Sino-Indian friendship, only imperialists need it. And those who deliberately undermine Sino-Indian friendly relations are indeed trying their best to make China and India lose their common language. For example, they slander socialist China as a "Han Chinese imperialist" country. They describe the Indian army's intrusion into the Chinese border as China's "aggression" against India. They call the border tension they provoked a "sudden international war." They call the illegal "McMahon Line," which has never been recognized by the Chinese government, a "legal" border that "China has long recognized," and so on.

    Lin Feng said that this kind of black-and-white reversal and "vocabulary" is naturally understood only by Indian expansionists, we do not understand it. There is indeed very little, or even no, "common language" between us and Indian expansionists.

    Lin Feng emphasized that the essence of the problem is naturally not a language issue, but that expansionists insist on a kind of "logic" that cannot be justified. They insist on saying that the aggression against the Chinese border is China's "aggression" against the Indian border, which of course the Chinese people absolutely cannot agree to. Moreover, how can this trick of reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong deceive the people of the world? Will this have any beneficial effect on the credibility of the Indian government, one of the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence?

    He said that, in fact, the most suitable solution for the interests of the Indian state and people is to completely abandon this absurd attempt to impose one's will on others, which can never be realized, and to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue through friendly consultation on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—first of all, the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.

    Lin Feng said that if the Indian authorities are obsessed with their own ideas and want to use all kinds of deceptive methods, including all kinds of sophistry, to cover up their aggressive acts, and even slander the invaded China as some kind of "imperialism," the result will inevitably be self-defeating and a complete failure.
    Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian Government Should Prioritize Sino-Indian Friendship, Refrain from Continuing on a Dangerous Course, Immediately Withdraw the Intruded Indian Troops and Administrative Personnel, Stop Anti-China Activities, and Ensure That Sino-Indian Friendship Is Maintained and Consolidated

    Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, sternly criticized Prime Minister Nehru's impolite and unfriendly attitude towards China. He said that the Indian army intruded into the Chinese border, but Prime Minister Nehru repeatedly slandered China for carrying out aggression, and insisted that we "intimidate" them. Is this also "politeness" and "friendship?" This is completely contrary to the Five Principles. Mr. Nehru also said: "In India, unlike in China, the law recognizes many parties and protects the right to express different opinions." This is a malicious attack on China for not having other parties and not having the freedom to express opinions. I would like to ask Mr. Nehru, is your disregard for the existence and democratic rights of China's democratic parties not a good proof of disrespect for China?

    He demanded that Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian government truly prioritize Sino-Indian friendship, refrain from continuing on a dangerous course, immediately withdraw the intruded Indian troops and administrative personnel, restore the long-standing state of the border between the two countries, stop the crazy anti-China activities of Indian expansionists, and ensure that the profound friendship between China and India is always maintained and consolidated.

    Wang Yunsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Journalists Association, warned the Indian national chauvinists in his speech to clear their heads, open their eyes and take a look; it is not too late to turn back. There will be no good result from antagonizing the Chinese people.

    Wang Yunsheng said that the Indian army constantly crosses the border to carry out provocations while shouting that "China has invaded India." This is a shameless public extortion.

    Wang Yunsheng also sternly rebuked the Indian bourgeois right-wing newspapers for carrying out rumors and slanderous propaganda against China.

    Non-Party Democrat Ma Yinchu said that Nehru keeps saying that he abides by the Five Principles and does not allow the Dalai Lama and Tibetan rebels to carry out anti-China political activities in India. However, in reality, the Tibetan rebels have been openly carrying out anti-China activities. Is this an act of abiding by the Five Principles? Nehru keeps saying that he respects Sino-Indian friendship and is willing to use peaceful methods to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue, but he disagrees with our government's proposal to comprehensively resolve the Sino-Indian border issue and wants to resolve it by one mile, two miles, and three miles at a time. Does this show Mr. Nehru's sincerity in resolving the Sino-Indian border issue?
    Our Country Has Its Own Vast Territory, and It Is a Socialist Country, and Will Never Invade an Inch of Territory of Any Country, Nor Will It Allow Anyone to Occupy an Inch of Its Own Land

    Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said in a written statement that the anti-China wave re-ignited by Indian expansionists this time is destined to suffer the same shameful defeat as their past support for the Tibetan rebellion.

    Gao Chongmin expressed regret for Prime Minister Nehru's short-sighted actions in the two anti-China movements in India this year.

    Gao Chongmin said that the People's Republic of China has its own vast territory, and it is a socialist country. It will never invade an inch of territory of any country, nor will it allow anyone to occupy an inch of its own land. Our country is willing to negotiate with the Indian side on the Sino-Indian border issue in a friendly manner.

    Chen Shaoxian, a Standing Committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, advised the Indian authorities not to do things that "grieve those who are close and please those who hate." He said, "I participated in the Xinhai Revolution and experienced the historical period from the late Qing Dynasty to the Liberation. I know that no central government in China has ever recognized the 'McMahon Line'. Today, when the Chinese people have stood up, the Indian government actually wants China to accept this illegal boundary line. Isn't this a fool's dream and a waste of effort?"

    Chen Shaoxian believes that the Indian authorities' attacks on China will only fuel the activities of those who create tension and undermine Sino-Indian friendship, and will be harmful and unhelpful to the cause of maintaining Sino-Indian friendship and world peace. Chen Qiyu, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said in a written statement that India's provocative incidents on the Sino-Indian border violate China's territorial sovereignty and violate the Five Principles. We overseas Chinese cannot but express great indignation and express our firm opposition.

    Chen Qiyu said that Prime Minister Nehru should adopt a wise attitude and think calmly: who benefits from the current situation on the Sino-Indian border? Obviously, it is not China, nor India, but imperialism.

    Chen Qiyu said that our country has always valued Sino-Indian friendship, but the friendship between the two countries is by no means a unilateral matter for us, but requires the joint efforts of China and India.
    Our People of All Ethnic Groups Have Always Cherished Sino-Indian Friendship, but the Two Anti-China Upsurges Launched by Indian Expansionists in the Past Six Months Cannot but Arouse Great Indignation Among Our People of All Ethnic Groups

    Xie Fumin, Deputy Director of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, said in a written statement that our people of all ethnic groups have always cherished Sino-Indian friendship, but the two anti-China upsurges launched by Indian expansionists in the past six months cannot but arouse great indignation among our people of all ethnic groups. On behalf of the minority nationalities of our country, he expressed serious protest against the anti-China clamor and open insults of our leaders by Indian expansionists, as well as the intrusion of the Indian army into our country's territory.

    Hou Debang, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, said in a written statement that the McMahon Line is a product of British imperialism's invasion of Tibet. McMahon himself was a British diplomat and a henchman of British colonial aggression. Hou Debang said that of course, this line cannot become the Sino-Indian border, and Prime Minister Nehru himself is clear about this. If the watershed is said to be the natural boundary, and the Himalayas should be the Sino-Indian border, it is like saying that the Rhine River is the natural boundary between France and Germany, which is obviously not in line with the facts.

    Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in a written statement that the attitude adopted by the Chinese government on the Sino-Indian border issue as expressed by Premier Zhou is reasonable and well-founded, and anyone with reason and a desire for international peace cannot but agree. However, Nehru's attitude is the opposite.

    Tao Menghe said that we demand that Nehru not betray his peaceful neutralism, and that he earnestly abide by and promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by him and Premier Zhou.

    Zhou Peiyuan, Vice Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said in a written statement that Prime Minister Nehru is very fond of the so-called McMahon Line. Prime Minister Nehru said that the McMahon Line "happens to have an advantage" because it is a "clear watershed." This is purely absurd. There is indeed a watershed there, but it is not Indian, nor is it shared by China and India, but a watershed in our territory. Does India simply draw 90,000 square kilometers of our territory into the Indian territory with a stroke of the pen because there is a watershed there?

    Zhou Shutao, a Standing Committee member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, expressed indignation in a written statement at Prime Minister Nehru's continued attacks on China in his recent speeches. He said that Nehru said that China is "proud and arrogant" and groundlessly accused China of "aggression against Indian territory," which makes people even more suspicious of whether he has the sincerity to "cherish Sino-Indian friendship."

    Zhou Shutao said that China has adopted a restrained attitude towards the anti-China clamor of some people in India only to maintain Sino-Indian friendship. It would be a big mistake to interpret this attitude as being weak and easy to bully.
    Inheriting the Mantle of British Imperialist Aggression and Putting Pressure on the 650 Million Chinese People Will Not Benefit the Indian Government and the Indian People.

    Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said in a written statement that the Sino-Indian border incident this time is another manifestation of Indian expansionists' hostility towards our country after supporting the Tibetan rebellion. He said that Prime Minister Nehru also disregarded the Five Principles and Sino-Indian friendship, saying that we are "imperialists" and "aggressors," and insisted that we recognize the illegal, unilateral, and imposed McMahon Line. We feel great indignation at this and express our solemn protest.

    Yang Mingxuan hoped that Nehru would prioritize Sino-Indian friendship, adhere to the Five Principles, immediately stop all anti-China activities in India, and withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who had crossed the border to open the way for friendly consultation on the Sino-Indian border issue.

    Zhu Xuefan, a Standing Committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said in a written statement that the so-called McMahon Line is nothing more than the evil product of imperialism sneaking around and plotting aggression behind people's backs that cannot be seen in the sun. I am a postal and telecommunications worker. From the postal point of view, the postal service of old China was once controlled by British imperialism and other imperialists for a long time. However, when we open the old postal maps of China over the years, although those maps were drawn by the old postal authorities under the control of imperialism, there has never been a map that takes the so-called McMahon Line as the boundary. It can be seen that this boundary line has never appeared in China at any time, even when the imperialist forces were most rampant in China. However, the Indian authorities forcibly demanded that China accept that unreasonable boundary line, and even resorted to military provocations in an attempt to force China to accept it. We want to tell them frankly: you have the wrong idea. The new China that has stood up is not easy to bully.

    Zhang Nanxian, a non-party democrat, said in a written statement that this time Indian Prime Minister Nehru seems to be eloquent, insisting that the territory of China must be included in the McMahon Line's map boundary line. The speeches of the members these days have used true and reliable materials to prove that Nehru's statement is unreasonable. I also hope that Prime Minister Nehru will recognize clearly: in the past, the extremely weak Beiyang warlords and the various governments of Chiang Kai-shek did not agree to this illegal boundary line. Today, can the new China, where 650 million people have stood up, still be allowed to be slaughtered?

    Che Xiangchen, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said in a written statement that the Chinese government has always advocated that China and India should consider the historical background and the current actual situation, and comprehensively resolve the border issues between the two countries in a prepared and step-by-step manner through friendly consultation in accordance with the Five Principles. He said that inheriting the mantle of British imperialist aggression and putting pressure on the great China and the 650 million Chinese people is a very dangerous path that will not benefit the Indian government or the Indian people.
    Our Government's Position, Attitude, and Principles are Fully in Line with the Spirit of the Five Principles, and Fully Reflect the Reasonable and Measured Attitude of the New Socialist China towards the Great Neighbor India after Independence.

    Guo Zechen, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said in a written statement that the position, attitude, and principles adopted by the Chinese government on the border issue between China and India are fully in line with the spirit of the Five Principles, and fully reflect the reasonable and measured attitude of the new socialist China towards the great neighbor India after independence.

    Guo Zechen said that Indian expansionists and their propaganda machine, encouraged by imperialism, are spewing anti-China rhetoric, and even openly clamoring to bomb Chinese territory. However, Mr. Nehru said that China "intimidated" India, which is a complete reversal of black and white. The fact is that India has done its best to intimidate China, and has even brought out the methods and vocabulary of imperialist extortion to deal with a friendly neighbor. Guo Zechen said that the Chinese people who have stood up are not afraid of any intimidation. The Indian government authorities must regain their sanity, immediately stop on the edge of the cliff, and maintain the traditional friendship between China and India.

    Yang Dongchun, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, believes in a written statement that the Indian government's unreasonable attitude towards China on the Sino-Indian border issue is the logical development after the failure to interfere in China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. He said that during the Tibetan rebellion, Nehru said that his attitude towards the Tibetan rebellion would consider three factors, one of which was "the integrity of India." In fact, China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is entirely China's internal affair, and what does it have to do with "the integrity of India and the freedom of India"? Now, the problem is very clear. It turns out that one of the "factors" that Prime Minister Nehru considered was to impose his one-sided proposition on the Sino-Indian border issue on China.

    Yang Dongchun said that these things make us have to doubt Mr. Nehru's sincerity for peace. In fact, it is not others who have made the situation "serious," but Prime Minister Nehru himself. "He who ties the bell to the tiger must untie it." We are waiting for Prime Minister Nehru to make a prompt decision and make a correct choice in line with the principles of peace.
    It is hoped that Mr. Nehru, one of the founders of the Five Principles, will take immediate measures to return to the path that is conducive to Sino-Indian friendship and world peace.

    Liu Fei, a Standing Committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said in a written statement that he hoped that Mr. Nehru, one of the founders of the Five Principles, would realize his mistake and take immediate measures to withdraw the intruded Indian troops and administrative personnel, restore the long-standing situation on the border between the two countries, and return to the bright and correct path that is conducive to the friendship between the people of China and India, and conducive to peace in the Far East and the world.

    Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, made a written statement saying that China has adhered to a friendly policy towards India, the great neighbor that has also suffered from imperialist aggression in the past, and has adopted an attitude of great patience, great caution, and great restraint towards some complex issues on the border between the two countries created and left over by imperialism, hoping that the two sides will resolve them through peaceful consultation. But this does not mean that the Chinese people who have stood up will still endure all unreasonable and illegal treatment, and even rude interference, provocation, and aggression in China's internal affairs. Chu Tunan said that we want to warn the Indian right-wing parties and expansionists that your attempt to unilaterally impose an illegal and unreasonable border on China is doomed to complete failure.

    He said that in order to maintain the traditional and profound friendship between the people of China and India, and to enable the borders between China and India to be resolved smoothly and fairly on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we cannot but give a ruthless exposure and a powerful counterattack to the unreasonable clamor and aggressive behavior of the Indian right-wing parties and expansionists.

### 要求印度政府遵守五项原则珍惜中印友谊

    全国人民代表大会常委会扩大会议继续讨论中印边界问题
    要求印度政府遵守五项原则珍惜中印友谊
    西方帝国主义势力及其在印度的代理人正在力图利用中印边界事件破坏中印友谊、改变印度和平中立外交政策，希望印度人民战胜这种恶毒的阴谋
    据新华社13日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会今天上午举行扩大的第八次会议，继续讨论中印边界问题。在会上发言和书面发言的人，一致坚决支持我国政府对于解决中印边界问题所持的严正立场、明确态度和正确方针，要求印度政府以中印友谊为重，立即制止反华活动，撤回越境的印度军队和行政人员，通过和平协商解决中印边界问题。
    印度政府的错误政策如果继续下去，必将给帝国主义造成可乘之机，印度政府和印度人民应引起极大的警惕
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林枫在发言中，严正地驳斥了印度总理尼赫鲁在中印边界问题上所发表的一系列损害中印友谊的言论。他对于得到印度政府怂恿的印度扩张主义分子对中国的恶毒攻击，表示无比的愤慨。他强烈地表示，印度政府的错误政策如果继续下去，“必将给帝国主义造成可乘之机”，他要求印度政府和印度人民应引起“极大的警惕”。
    林枫说，尽管中国一直以中印友谊为重，对于边境事件表现了极大的克制和忍耐，作为和平共处五项原则的创始人之一，同时又是了解中印边境实际情况的尼赫鲁总理，却也对中国接二连三地发表了很不友好的言论。林枫指出，尼赫鲁一再声称，中国军队“侵犯”了印度领土，并且说，“这是一个明白的侵略事件”。这完全是“强词夺理，颠倒黑白”的攻击。特别9月10日尼赫鲁在印度联邦院的讲话，竟然替英帝国主义辩护，含沙射影地诬蔑中国为“中国帝国主义”，把中国描写成为一个“随便对待，并且企图威吓”印度的骄横狂妄的国家。
    林枫愤慨地说：“一向以尊重事实相标榜的尼赫鲁总理，竟然发表完全违背事实的谬论，这实在使人感到十分遗憾”。
    林枫还驳斥了尼赫鲁在联邦院所发表的这样一些奇怪的见解，似乎中国人和印度人之间没有共同的政治语言。林枫说，不论六亿五千万中国人民，或是四亿印度人民，都知道，虽然中印两国人民用着不同民族的语言文字，但是我们两国的人民，在处理相互关系问题上，在友好合作的问题上，是充分有着共同语言的。如果事情真像尼赫鲁总理所说的，我们两国没有共同的语言，那么，我们两国之间又如何能够共同创造出举世闻名的、和平共处的五项原则呢？
    他说，如果中国的文字真像尼赫鲁所说的，在和德文、英文以及其他文字互相翻译的时候就会改变原意，那么，一切热心促进中印友好的中印人士，又如何能建立和交流他们的感情和友谊呢？从中国汉朝以来，特别从唐朝以来更加发展的中印两国文化交流，又是如何实现的呢？很显然，说中印两国没有共同的语言，实在是一种奇谈怪论。
    他指出，这种怪论决不会为主张中印友好的广大人民所欢迎，只有帝国主义分子才需要它。而蓄意破坏中印友好关系的分子，确实在竭力使中印两国失去共同语言。例如，他们把社会主义的中国，诬蔑成为“汉族帝国主义”国家。他们把印军侵入中国边境，说成是中国对印度的“侵略”。他们把自己挑起的边境紧张局面，叫做“从天而降的国际战争”。他们把从来没有得到中国政府承认的不合法的“麦克马洪线”，叫做“合法的”“早经中国承认的”边界，如此等等。
    林枫说，这种颠倒黑白的行为和“辞汇”，自然只有印度扩张主义分子懂得，我们是不懂得的。我们和印度扩张主义分子之间，“共同语言”确实是很少、甚至是没有的。
    林枫强调地说，问题的实质，自然并不是什么语言文字问题，而是扩张主义分子硬要坚持一种根本无法自圆其说的“逻辑”。他们把对于中国边境的侵略，硬说成是中国对印度边境的“侵略”，这当然是中国人民所绝对不能同意的，而且，这种颠倒黑白、混淆是非的伎俩，怎能掩尽天下人的耳目呢？这对于和平共处五项原则首创者之一的印度政府的信誉，难道会产生任何有利的影响吗？
    他说，其实，最符合于印度国家和人民利益的解决办法，就是彻底放弃这种强加于人，并且永远不能实现的荒谬企图，通过友好协商，在和平共处五项原则——首先是互相尊重主权和领土完整原则的基础上，解决中印边境问题。
    林枫说，如果印度当局执迷不悟，想用各色各样的骗人手法，包括各种诡辩，来掩盖自己的侵略行为，甚至倒过来诬蔑被侵犯的中国是什么“帝国主义”，其结果必将是心劳日拙，陷于完全的失败。
    尼赫鲁总理和印度政府要以中印友谊为重，悬崖勒马，立即撤回越境印军和行政人员，制止反华活动，使中印友谊坚持和巩固下去
  中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员荣毅仁严词指责尼赫鲁总理对待中国的不礼貌、不友好的态度。他说，印军侵入中国边境，但尼赫鲁总理却一再污蔑中国进行侵略，硬说我们“威吓”他们，也是什么“礼貌”和“友谊”吗？这是和五项原则完全相违背的。尼赫鲁先生又说：“在印度，不像在中国，法律承认许多党派，并且保护表示不同的意见的权利”，这是恶意攻击中国没有其他党派，没有表示意见的自由。我要请问尼赫鲁先生，你这样无视中国民主党派的存在和民主权利的行使，难道不是不尊重中国的一个很好的证明么？
    他要求尼赫鲁总理和印度政府真正以中印友谊为重，悬崖勒马，立即撤回越境印军和行政人员，恢复两国边界久已存在的状况，制止印度扩张主义分子疯狂的反华活动，使中印的深厚友谊，始终不渝地坚持和巩固下去。
    中华全国新闻工作者协会副会长王芸生在发言中警告印度的民族沙文主义者，清醒一些头脑，睁开眼睛看看，迷途未远，赶快回头。敌视中国人民，不会有好的结果。
    王芸生说，印度军队不断越界进行挑衅，同时大嚷大叫说“中国侵略了印度”，这是一种无耻的公开讹诈。
    王芸生还严肃责斥了印度资产阶级右翼报纸对中国所进行的造谣和诽谤宣传。
    无党派民主人士马寅初说，尼赫鲁口口声声说他遵守五项原则，不允许达赖喇嘛和西藏叛乱分子在印度进行反对中国的政治活动。但是，实际上西藏叛乱分子却一直在公开进行着反对中国的活动。这是遵守五项原则的行为吗？尼赫鲁口口声声尊重中印友谊，愿意用和平的方法来解决中印边界问题，但是他却不同意我国政府提出全面地来解决中印边界问题，而要一英里、二英里、三英里的来解决，难道这能说明尼赫鲁先生解决中印边界问题的诚意吗？
    我国有自己辽阔的领域，而且是社会主义国家，绝不会侵略任何国家一寸领土，也绝不让任何人侵占自己一寸土地
    中国民主同盟副主席高崇民在书面发言中说，印度扩张主义分子这次再度掀起的反华浪潮，注定要同他们过去支持西藏叛乱一样，遭到可耻的失败。
    高崇民对尼赫鲁总理在今年印度这两次反华运动中所表现出的眼光短浅的行动表示惋惜。
    高崇民说，中华人民共和国有自己的辽阔的领域，而且是社会主义国家，它绝不会侵略任何国家的一寸领土，也绝不让任何人侵占自己一寸土地。我国愿以友好态度同印度方面协商解决中印边界问题。
    中国国民党革命委员会常务委员陈劭先在书面发言中忠告印度当局不要再做“为亲者所痛，为仇者所快”的事情。他说，“我曾参加过辛亥革命，经历了从清末至解放的历史时期。我知道，中国的任何一个中央政府都没有承认过什么‘麦克马洪线’。当中国人民已经站立起来的今天，印度政府竟要中国接受这条非法界线，这岂不是痴人作梦，枉费心机。”
    陈劭先认为，印度当局攻击中国的言论，只会助长那些制造紧张局势、破坏中印友谊的人的活动，而对于维护中印友谊和世界和平的事业，是有害无益的。中华全国归国华侨联合会副主席陈其瑗在书面发言中说，印度在中印边境的挑衅事件，侵犯了中国领土主权，违犯了五项原则，我们华侨不能不表示极大的愤慨，并表示坚决反对。
    陈其瑗说，尼赫鲁总理应当采取明智的态度，静思一下：目前中印边界上的局势究竟对谁有利，显然，不是中国，也不是印度，而是帝国主义。
    陈其瑗说，我国一向以中印友谊为重，但是两国友谊决不是我们单方面的事情，而是需要中印两国共同的努力。
    我国各族人民素来珍重中印友谊，但是印度扩张主义者半年来发动两次反华高潮，不能不引起我国各族人民的极大愤慨
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会副主任委员谢扶民在书面发言中说，我国各族人民素来是珍重中印友谊的，但是印度扩张主义者半年来发动两次反华高潮，这不能不引起我国各族人民的极大愤慨。他代表我国的少数民族人民对印度扩张主义者进行反华喧嚷和公然侮辱我国领袖的行为，以及印度军队侵入我国的领土，表示严重抗议。
    中国科学技术协会副主席侯德榜在书面发言中说，麦克马洪线是英帝国主义侵略我国西藏的产物。麦克马洪这个人本是英国外交官，为英国侵略殖民地的爪牙。侯德榜说，当然这条线不可能成为中印边界，尼赫鲁总理本人是清楚的。若谓分水岭就是天然的界线，喜马拉雅山应作为中、印边界，那也像说莱茵河作为法国与德国天然边界一样，这是显然不符合事实的。
    中国科学院副院长陶孟和在书面发言中说，周总理所表明的中国政府在中印边界问题上所采取的态度是合情合理的，凡是具有理性具有国际和平愿望的人不能不同意。但是尼赫鲁所持的态度，却与此相反。
    陶孟和说，我们要求尼赫鲁不要背叛他的和平中立主义，要切切实实地遵守并推进他同周总理共同倡议的和平共处五项原则。
    九三学社副主席周培源在书面发言中说，尼赫鲁总理对于所谓麦克马洪线十分欣赏，尼赫鲁总理说麦克马洪线“适巧有一个优点”，因为它是一道“明显的分水岭”，这纯属荒诞之谈。那里的确有一道分水岭，不过那不是印度的，也不是中印共有的，而是我国领土上的分水岭。印度难道因为那儿有一道分水岭，就可以把我国九万平方公里的领土，大笔一挥划入印度国境吗？
    中华全国工商业联合会常务委员周叔弢在书面发言中，对于尼赫鲁总理在连日讲话中继续攻击中国，表示愤慨。他说，尼赫鲁说中国“骄傲和傲慢”，不顾事实地指责中国“对印度领土的侵略”，这就更加使人怀疑他是否具有“珍视中印友谊”的诚意。
    周叔弢说，中国对于印度某些人的反华叫嚷采取克制态度，只是为了维护中印友谊。如果把这种态度理解成为软弱可欺，那就大错特错了。
    继承英帝国主义侵略的衣钵，向六亿五千万中国人民施加压力，对印度政府和印度人民都不会有什么好处。
    中国民主同盟副主席杨明轩在书面发言中说，这次中印边境事件是印度扩张主义分子继支持西藏叛乱事件之后的又一次敌视我国的表现。他说，尼赫鲁总理也竟然不顾五项原则和中印友好，说我们是“帝国主义”，是“侵略”，并且硬要我们承认非法的片面强加于人的麦克马洪线。对此，我们感到极大的愤慨，并表示严正的抗议。
    杨明轩希望尼赫鲁以中印友好为重，坚持五项原则，立即制止印度国内一切反华活动，并且撤回越境的印度军队和行政人员，为友好协商中印边界问题打开路径。
    中国国民党革命委员会常务委员朱学范在书面发言中说，所谓麦克马洪线，只不过是帝国主义者偷偷摸摸背着人捣鬼的不能见太阳的侵略的罪恶产物。我是一个邮电工作者，从邮政方面来说，旧中国的邮政曾经被英帝国主义和别的帝国主义长期控制过。但是我们翻开旧中国历年的邮政舆图，虽然那些地图是在帝国主义控制下的旧邮政当局绘制的，可是从来没有一张地图是以所谓麦克马洪线为疆界的。可见这条界线在中国任何时候，即使是帝国主义势力在中国最猖獗的时候，也不曾出现过。可是印度当局强要中国接受那种不合理的边界线，甚至不惜以武力挑衅，企图胁迫中国接受。我们要正告他们：你们的念头转错了。站起来了的新中国，不是好欺的。
    无党派民主人士张难先在书面发言中说，这回印度总理尼赫鲁好像振振有词，非照麦克马洪线的地图界线把中国的领土划进去不可，这几天各位委员的发言，用千真万确的材料，证明尼赫鲁这种说法是毫无道理的。我还希望尼赫鲁总理认清楚：过去中国极软弱的北洋军阀、蒋介石各政府，都没有同意这条非法的界线，到今天六亿五千万人民已经站起来了的新中国，还能听人宰割吗？
    中国民主促进会副主席车向忱在书面发言中说，中国政府一贯主张，中印双方应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，有准备有步骤地通过友好协商，全面解决两国边界问题。他说，继承英帝国主义侵略的衣钵，向伟大的中国和六亿五千万中国人民施加压力，这样一条道路是非常危险的，对印度政府和对印度人民都不会有什么好处。
    我国政府的立场、态度和方针，完全合乎五项原则的精神，完全体现出社会主义的新中国对独立后的伟大邻国印度极为有理有节的态度
    中国农工民主党中央委员会主席团委员郭则沉在书面发言中说，中国政府在中印两国边境问题上所采取的立场、态度和方针，完全合乎五项原则的精神，完全体现出社会主义的新中国对独立后的伟大邻国印度极为有理有节的态度。
    郭则沉说，印度扩张主义分子和他们的宣传机器，在帝国主义的鼓励下，大放反华谰言，甚至公然叫嚣要轰炸中国领土。可是尼赫鲁先生说，中国“吓唬”了印度，这完全是颠倒黑白。事实是印度竭尽吓唬中国之能事，甚至不惜把帝国主义讹诈的手段和词汇都搬出来对付一个友好的邻国。郭则沉说，已经站起来的中国人民，是不怕任何吓唬的。印度政府当局必须恢复理智，立即悬崖勒马，维护中印两国的传统友谊。
    中国民主促进会副主席杨东莼在书面发言中认为，印度政府在中印边界问题上对中国的无理态度，是在干涉中国平定西藏叛乱事件失败以后的逻辑发展。他说，在西藏叛乱事件发生期间，尼赫鲁曾说他对西藏叛乱事件的态度要考虑三个因素，其中之一是“印度的完整”。事实上，中国平定西藏叛乱，完全是中国的内政问题，跟“印度的完整和印度的自由”有什么关系呢？现在，问题很清楚了，原来尼赫鲁总理所考虑的“因素”之一，是要把自己关于中印边界问题的片面主张强加于中国。
    杨东莼说，这一些，使我们对尼赫鲁先生的和平诚意不能不产生怀疑。事实上，使局势“严重”起来的不是别人，正是尼赫鲁总理自己。“解铃还要系铃人”，我们正在等待着尼赫鲁总理当机立断，作出符合和平原则的正确抉择。
    希望作为五项原则创始人之一的尼赫鲁先生，立即采取措施，回到有利于中印友谊和世界和平的道路上来。
    中国国民党革命委员会常务委员刘斐在书面发言中，希望作为五项原则创始人之一的尼赫鲁先生迷途知返，立即采取措施，撤回越境的印度军队和行政人员，恢复两国边界久已存在的状况，回到有利于中印两国人民的友谊、有利于远东和世界和平的光明正确的道路上来。
    中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南发表书面谈话说，中国对于过去同样遭受过帝国主义侵略的伟大邻邦印度，是坚持了友好政策的，对于帝国主义所制造和遗留下来的两国边界上的一些复杂问题，采取极大忍耐、极大谨慎和极大克制的态度，希望双方和平协商解决。但这不是说，站起来的中国人民仍然要忍受一切无理和非法的对待，乃至对中国内政的粗暴干涉、挑衅和侵略。楚图南说，我们要正告印度右翼政党和扩张主义分子，你们企图单方面以非法和不合理的边界强加于中国，注定要彻底失败的。
    他说，为维护中印两国人民传统的深厚友谊，为使中印两国边界能够在平等互利、和平共处五项原则基础上得到顺利而公正地解决，我们对于印度右翼政党和扩张主义分子对中国的无理叫嚣和侵略行为，不能不给予无情的揭露和有力的回击。（附图片）
