Comrades,

As the head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Chile, I am very honored to extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Chilean Communists, the Chilean people, and their working class to the beloved Chinese people, their proletariat, and their outstanding vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party.

On this day, when the people and fraternal parties of other countries around the world are celebrating the glorious tenth anniversary of the liberation of the Chinese people and the birth of the great People's Republic of China with joy, we join this joy with our congratulations and our presence.

The tenth anniversary of the victory of the Chinese revolution fills us with pride and inspires us with optimism and confidence in the complete victory of our Marxist-Leninist principles. The tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a contribution of decisive historical significance to the cause of socialism, to the struggle of the people of all countries for liberation, and to peaceful coexistence among nations.

Every achievement you make in socialist construction inspires us in our own struggle against the common enemy—American imperialism and its lackeys. American imperialism never ceases to oppress our people, plunder our wealth, exploit our workers to the extreme, and attempt to use us as cannon fodder or accomplices in their war adventures. But in our country, as in other countries in Latin America, the struggle to eradicate these evils is intensifying.

Many bloody dictators, tools of imperialism, have been overthrown. Our people have also widely participated in the anti-imperialist struggle. We have resisted the greed of monopoly capital to defend our oil; we have fought against the conspiracies of the imperialists at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the American States held in Santiago; we have supported the Cuban revolution and our brothers who are fighting against the remaining dictatorships.

The Chilean national liberation movement is booming. In the most recent election, the anti-imperialist candidate was only 30,000 votes away from winning the presidency. The "People's Action Front," the alliance of various people's parties in which our party participates, is preparing for new battles, strengthening its organization, establishing closer ties with the people's struggle, and taking joint action with other political forces to defend national sovereignty.

The unity of the working people, centered on the "Unified Trade Union of Chilean Workers," is strengthening and crushing the divisive conspiracies of those bought off by imperialism. The peasants have plunged into the liberation struggle for land, bread, and the right to organize with new strength.

Although there is an openly reactionary government, the people's movement to develop relations with the socialist camp has made progress. Important progressive strata, political parties, upper-level commercial groups, and cultural institutions have participated in this movement. Prominent anti-communists also advocate and demand that the government establish formal relations with the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries.

The major changes that have taken place in international politics have resonated even among the most reactionary strata in our country. The successful development of the Seven-Year Plan, the Great Leap Forward, the launch of rockets to the moon, Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States, and the universal progress of socialist countries have greatly helped to break the isolation imposed on us by the imperialist Cold War policy.

The Chilean people and the working class, under the leadership of their advanced party, are preparing for the great battles to come. The current government continues to implement the "austerity policy" planned by imperialism for various countries. The economic crisis has worsened, the number of unemployed has reached 200,000, and the cost of living has risen sharply.

To resist this policy, the people's movement is preparing to go on the offensive. The proletariat is reviewing its organizational structure and fighting methods in order to better meet new battles and lead the democratic liberation front forward. The Communist Party is strengthening its organization: in the two membership drives conducted in the last thirteen months, the number of members has increased by 226 percent.

Because of all the prospects we can see in our homeland, we Chilean Communists cherish the extraordinary leap forward in socialist construction by the Chinese people, considering it a great encouragement to us. The completion of your first Five-Year Plan, the transformation of private ownership relations in agriculture, commerce, and industry into socialist ownership relations, the establishment of people's communes, the improvement of work style and leadership methods, and your Great Leap Forward in the process of building a new China are all great experiences from which we will draw valuable lessons. We have witnessed firsthand in your country the enthusiasm and actions of millions of working people who, under the correct leadership of their Communist Party and their beloved Chairman Mao Zedong, are working for a new society.

On this glorious tenth anniversary, we respectfully wish you greater happiness and all victories in the common struggle for peace, national independence, socialism, and communism.

My words are finished.

    智利共产党中央委员会政治委员会委员、书记处书记、智利共产党代表团团长
    何塞·冈萨雷斯同志的贺词同志们：
    作为智利共产党代表团团长，我非常荣幸地代表智利共产党人、智利人民和他们的工人阶级，向亲爱的中国人民，他们的无产阶级及其卓越的先锋队——中国共产党，致以热烈的祝贺。
    世界其它各国人民和兄弟党，在这个日子，正怀着欢乐的心情庆祝中国人民光荣的解放的十周年，并庆祝伟大的中华人民共和国的诞生，我们以我们的祝贺和我们的出席来参加这一欢乐。
    中国革命胜利的十周年使我们感到骄傲，并且鼓舞了我们对于我们的马克思列宁主义原则的完全胜利的乐观和信心。中华人民共和国诞生十年，对于社会主义事业，对于全世界各国人民争取解放的斗争，对于各国之间的和平共处，是具有决定性的历史意义的贡献。
    你们在社会主义建设中的每一成就，都使我们在我们自己反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗——的斗争中获得鼓舞。美帝国主义一刻也不放松地压迫我们的人民，掠夺我们的财富，极度地剥削我们的劳动者，并且企图利用我们来当他们战争冒险中的炮灰或帮凶。但是在我们国家，正和在拉丁美洲其他国家一样，正加强为根除这些祸害而进行的斗争。
    许多血腥的独裁者，帝国主义的工具，已经被推翻。我们的人民也广泛地参加了反帝斗争。我们曾经抵抗垄断资本的贪婪来保卫我们的石油；我们对于帝国主义者在圣地亚哥举行的美洲国家外长会议的阴谋进行了斗争；我们对于古巴的革命，对于和仍然存在的独裁政权进行斗争的弟兄们，给予了支持。
    智利民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展。在最近一次竞选中，反帝的候选人只差三万票就可以获得总统的职位。我们的党参加的各人民政党的联盟“人民行动阵线”，正在准备新的战斗，加强它的组织，和人民的斗争进一步取得密切联系，并和其他的政治力量采取共同行动来保卫民族主权。
    以“智利工人统一工会”为中心的劳动人民的团结正在加强，并粉碎了受帝国主义收买分子的分裂阴谋。农民以新的力量投入了争取土地，面包，和组织的权利的解放斗争。
    虽然存在有公开反动的政府，但争取和社会主义阵营发展关系的人民运动获得了进展。重要的进步阶层、政党、商业的上层团体和文化机关都参加了这一运动。著名的反共人物也主张，并且要求政府同苏联、人民中国和其他的社会主义国家建立正式的关系。
    国际政治上所发生的重大变化，甚至对我们国家最反动的阶层都引起了反响。七年计划的顺利发展、大跃进、向月球发射火箭、赫鲁晓夫同志的访问美国以及社会主义国家的普遍进展，大大地有助于打破帝国主义冷战政策强加于我们的孤立局面。
    智利人民和工人阶级，在他们的先进的政党领导下，正准备着即将到来的伟大战斗。目前政府正继续实施帝国主义为各国筹划的“节约政策”。经济危机严重了，失业的人数达到二十万人，生活费用又急剧地上涨。
    为了抵制这个政策，人民运动正准备转入攻势。无产阶级队伍正检阅它的组织机构和战斗方法，以便更好地迎接新的战斗，并领导民主解放阵线前进。共产党正在加强它的组织：在最近十三个月里所进行的两次发展党员的运动中，党员人数增加了百分之二百二十六。
    由于在我们祖国可以看到的这一切远景，我们智利共产党人珍视中国人民社会主义建设的特大跃进，认为这是对我们的巨大鼓舞。你们的第一个五年计划的完成，农业、商业和工业的私人所有制关系改造成社会主义所有制关系，人民公社的创立，工作作风和领导方法的改善，你们在新中国的缔造过程中的大跃进，这一切都是伟大经验，我们将从中吸取到宝贵的教益。我们在你们的国家亲眼看到了千百万劳动大众的热情和行动，他们在他们的共产党和他们亲爱的主席毛泽东同志的正确领导下，正在为一个新的社会而工作。
    在这光荣的十周年纪念，我们敬祝你们获得更大的幸福，并在争取和平，民族独立，社会主义及共产主义的共同斗争中取得一切胜利。
    我的话完了。（附图片）
