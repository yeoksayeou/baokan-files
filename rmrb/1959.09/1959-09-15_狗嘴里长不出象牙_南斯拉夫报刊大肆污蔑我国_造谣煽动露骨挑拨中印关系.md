Xinhua News Agency, September 13th dispatch from Belgrade: Recently, major Yugoslav newspapers have actively participated in the anti-China chorus orchestrated by Western imperialism and Indian expansionists. They have reversed black and white on the Sino-Indian border issue, maliciously slandering and defaming China, and taking the opportunity to vigorously provoke relations between China and India, as well as other Asian countries.

	The "Borba" newspaper published a commentary on September 5th stating that in the last few days of August, news about the "invasion" of Indian territory by Chinese border guards "spread throughout the world," and that China's "invasion of Indian territory actually undermined the Five Principles," adding that this behavior was "not accidental" but "consistent." In its commentary, the newspaper insisted that the fact that Indian troops had invaded Chinese territory and attacked Chinese troops was China's "invasion" of India. On the other hand, it tried its best to defend the real perpetrator, attempting to undermine relations between China and India. The Borba commentary believed that "India should not be condemned for being unfriendly to China," and said, "It is well known that it (referring to India) has always demonstrated its willingness to have good-neighborly relations with all its activities." In another commentary on September 9th, the "Borba" more blatantly provoked by saying that the Indian-Chinese relationship, which both sides considered close and friendly and permeated with the Panchsheel principles before the Tibetan rebellion, "is no longer the same." "Borba" also continuously published a large number of distorted reports from Western news agencies and Yugoslav news agency correspondents stationed in New Delhi in prominent positions, with inflammatory headlines such as: "Chinese troops refuse to leave Indian border posts"; "India's integrity should be maintained"; "Chinese troops enter three regions of Ladakh"; "Zhou Enlai departs from his past statements on the McMahon Line," and so on.
	The "Politika" newspaper published a commentary on September 3rd entitled "Invasion of Assam," stating that the Sino-Indian border incident was "caused by China's actions," and that "attempts to place responsibility for the incident on India are futile." Not only that, but the author of this commentary also eagerly slandered China's peaceful foreign policy, attempting to brand China with the crime of undermining "peace" and "creating international tension." The author of the commentary falsely claimed that China was attempting to "endlessly prolong the Cold War," "affect the general relaxation of the international situation," and "poison the atmosphere that was gained after painstaking efforts, namely, the atmosphere of meetings and talks between the world's highest responsible politicians." This commentary even threatened that "insisting on continuing to sharpen the situation is tantamount to consciously assuming responsibility for everything that may happen." The "Politika" magazine on September 8th provoked by saying that "Indian politicians expressed fear that Beijing's attempt seems to be to put these three countries (referring to Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim) under its control as it did with Tibet." Like "Borba," "Politika" also published a large number of distorted reports from Western news agencies and Yugoslav news agency correspondents stationed in New Delhi regarding the Sino-Indian border incident, with headlines such as: "Chinese military joint forces break into Indian territory"; "Chinese troops invade Indian territory is aggression"; "Zhou Enlai's envoy deteriorates the situation," and so on.
	Some other Yugoslav newspapers have shown themselves unwilling to fall behind in using the Sino-Indian border incident to slander China. "Narodna Armija" (People's Army) said that "Chinese troops invaded Indian territory," slandering China for "not supporting relaxation" and "taking steps to block the positive development of international relations again." "Nedeljne informativne novine" (Weekly Information Newspaper) spread rumors that China was attempting to resolve "disputed issues" by means of "armed border crossings," thereby creating a "new sharp situation," and provoked by saying that "the entry of Chinese armed forces into Indian territory has another negative aspect: there are more headaches in Asia." "The anxiety of some neighboring countries, primarily Burma and Indonesia, ... proves how heavy the current Himalayan incident weighs on the signatories of the Bandung Declaration."

    狗嘴里长不出象牙
    南斯拉夫报刊大肆污蔑我国
    造谣煽动露骨挑拨中印关系
    新华社13日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：最近一个时期，南斯拉夫的主要报刊积极参加了西方帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子所掀起的反华大合唱。它们在中印边境事件上颠倒黑白，对中国进行恶毒的污蔑和诽谤，同时乘机竭力挑拨中国同印度以及其他亚洲国家的关系。
    9月5日的“战斗报”发表评论说，8月的最后几天，关于中国边防军“侵犯”印度领土的消息“传遍了世界”，中国“侵犯印度领土实际上破坏了五项原则”，并说，这种行为“并非偶然”，而是“一贯的”。这家报纸在它的评论中一方面把印度军队侵入中国领土并袭击中国军队的事实硬说成是中国“侵犯”了印度，另一方面则竭力袒护真正的肇事者，妄想借此达到破坏中印两国关系的目的。战斗报的评论认为“不应谴责印度对中国不友好”，并说，“尽人皆知，它（指印度）一直以自己的全部活动证明它愿意有睦邻关系”。“战斗报”在9月9日的另一篇评论中则更露骨地挑拨说，在西藏叛乱以前双方都认为是亲密友好并贯穿着潘查希拉原则的印中关系“现在已不再是那样了”。“战斗报”还连续以显著地位大量刊登西方通讯社和南斯拉夫通讯社驻新德里记者的有关这方面的歪曲报道，并加上煽动性的大标题，诸如：“中国军队拒绝离开印度的边防岗哨”；“应该维护印度的完整”；“中国军队进入拉达克高原的三个地区”；“周恩来离开了自己过去关于麦克马洪线的声明”等等。
    “政治报”9月3日以“侵入阿萨姆”为题发表评论，说中印边境事件是“由中国的行动引起的”，并说什么“要把事件的责任推到印度身上的企图是虚妄的”。不仅如此，这篇评论的作者还亟力诽谤中国的和平外交政策，妄想给中国加上一个破坏“和平”、“制造国际紧张局势”的罪名。评论的作者信口胡说中国企图“无止境地延续冷战”，“影响国际局势的普遍和缓”和“毒化经过千辛万苦才获得的气氛，即毒化世界最高负责的政治家们会晤和会谈的气氛”。这篇评论甚至还威胁说，“坚持使局势继续尖锐化就等于有意识地承担对可能发生的一切责任”。9月8日的“政治报”画刊则挑拨说，“印度政治家表示害怕，似乎北京的企图是把这三个国家（按指尼泊尔、不丹、锡金）也像把西藏一样放在自己的控制之下”。同“战斗报”一样，“政治报”也刊登了大量西方通讯社和南斯拉夫通讯社驻新德里记者的关于中印边境事件的歪曲报道，它们的标题有：“中国军事联合部队闯入印度领土”；“中国军队侵入印度领土是侵略”；“周恩来的信使局势恶化”等等。
    南斯拉夫其他的一些报纸在利用中印边境事件对中国进行污蔑方面，表现得不甘落后。“人民军队报”说，“中国军队侵入了印度领土”，污蔑中国“不支持缓和”，“重新采取阻塞国际关系积极发展的步骤”。“新闻周报”造谣说，中国企图以“武装越境”的办法来解决“有争端的问题”，从而制造了“新的尖锐局势”，并挑拨说，“中国武装部队进入印度领土，还有一个消极的方面：在亚洲令人头痛的事情增多了”。“一些邻国，首先是缅甸和印度尼西亚的焦虑，……证明目前喜马拉雅山事件使这个万隆宣言的签字国感到多么地沉重”。
