Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, New Delhi Dispatch: Right-wing Indian political parties, and even local organizations of the ruling Congress Party, have recently and openly gathered their thugs to hold anti-China demonstrations in front of the Chinese Embassy and Consulates.

On the evening of September 6th, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh gathered a group of thugs to demonstrate in front of the Chinese Embassy in India in New Delhi. They wantonly shouted: "Chinese robbers get out of India," "Chinese imperialists get out of India," "Chinese aggressors get out of Tibet," "Border encroachment is intolerable," "Chinese imperialists are not allowed to interfere in India," "Re-fabricated Sino-Indian border maps," "Withdraw from occupied areas," "Aggression against Sikkim, Bhutan and Nepal is aggression against India." They also insulted Chinese leaders: "Zhou Enlai should die," "Zhou Enlai is shameful," "Down with Zhou Enlai." The banners they held also read: "China's Panchsheel is a lie," "Tibetan independence is India's security."

Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader Vajpayee also incited, "India must awaken as one. (China's) actual aggression has followed the aggression on the map."

Prior to this, on the evening of August 31st, a group of thugs gathered in front of the Chinese Embassy in India to hold an anti-China demonstration. They shouted: "Down with Chinese imperialists." The leader of the thugs delivered a speech, slandering China as an "aggressor" and saying that all of China's achievements were bragging. This group of thugs shouted in front of the embassy for half an hour. According to the "Indian Express", these thugs were members of the so-called Indian "Bolshevik Party." The chairman of this party, Dubey, openly said that China should revise its map according to the McMahon Line. On the same day, a group of Praja Socialist Party members provoked trouble in front of the Chinese Consulate General in Mumbai. They shouted reactionary slogans such as "Down with Zhou Enlai!" "Down with Communist China!" for about half an hour. They also held up banners demanding that China withdraw from "Indian territory" and border countries. Their leader, Dandavate, secretary of the Mumbai Committee of the Praja Socialist Party, also read out a "memorandum" to the gathering, slandering the Chinese government for "ruthlessly stifling Panchsheel." The memorandum also stated, "China's aggression against India is not an isolated event. It is a logical development of the brutal suppression of the people who revolted in Tibet."

On September 3rd, a group of Bharatiya Jana Sangh members held a demonstration outside the Chinese Consulate General in Mumbai. They held black flags and shouted slogans against China, saying that China had "invaded" Indian territory. The demonstrators even demanded that the Chinese government "apologize unconditionally" and compensate for the losses caused by the "border violations."

Even the local organizations of the ruling Congress Party participated in this extremely unfriendly activity towards China. According to the "Amrita Bazar Patrika", the Calcutta Central District Committee of the Congress Party gathered a group of people on August 30th to hold an anti-China demonstration in front of the Chinese Consulate General in Calcutta. Before the demonstration, they gathered to protest against the so-called "Chinese aggression." Ghosh, the vice-chairman of the West Bengal State Committee of the Congress Party, incited at the meeting that no patriotic Indian would be a passive bystander to China's continuous "invasion" of India's northern border. It is necessary to resolutely demand that the "aggressors" leave Indian territory.

    印度反动分子在我使馆前示威
    叫喊反华口号　辱骂我国领导人
    新华社9日讯　新德里消息：印度右翼政党以至执政的国大党的地方组织，最近公然接连纠集它们的暴徒到中国大使馆和领事馆门前举行反华示威。
    9月6日晚间，印度人民同盟纠集了一批暴徒在新德里中国驻印度大使馆门前举行示威。他们姿意叫骂：“中国强盗们滚出印度”、“中国帝国主义者滚出印度”、“中国侵略者滚出西藏”、“侵犯边境事件是不可容忍的”、“中国帝国主义者不许干涉印度”、“重新假造的印中边境地图”、“撤出占领地区”、“对锡金、不丹和尼泊尔的侵略就是对印度的侵略”。他们还辱骂中国领导人：“周恩来该死”、“周恩来可耻”、“打倒周恩来”。他们打的旗帜上还写着：“中国的潘查希拉是谎话”、“西藏的独立就是印度的安全”。
    人民同盟的首领巴志帕伊还煽动说，“印度必须像一个人一样觉醒起来。（中国）紧跟在地图上的侵略以后又来了实际的侵略。”
    在这以前，8月31日晚上，曾经有一批暴徒聚集在中国驻印度大使馆门前举行反华示威。他们叫喊：“打倒中国帝国主义者”。暴徒首领发表了演说，诬蔑中国是“侵略者”，说中国的一切成就都是吹牛。这批暴徒在大使馆门前叫嚷了半个小时。据“印度快报”报道，这批暴徒是所谓印度“布尔什维克党”的党徒。这个党的主席杜贝公然说，中国应当按照麦克马洪线修正它的地图。同一天，一批人民社会党分子曾经在中国驻孟买总领事馆前寻衅。他们高呼“打倒周恩来！”“打倒共产党中国！”等反动口号约达半小时之久。他们还举着写着要求中国撤出“印度领土”和边界国家的标语。他们的首领、人民社会党孟买党委书记丹德瓦塔还向集会的人宣读了一项“备忘录”，诬蔑中国政府“冷酷地扼杀了潘查希拉”。备忘录还说，“中国对印度的侵略不是一个孤立的事件。这是对西藏起义的人民进行残酷的镇压的合乎逻辑的发展。”
    9月3日，印度人民同盟一批党徒在中国驻孟买总领事馆外面举行示威。他们拿着黑旗，高呼反对中国的口号，说什么中国“侵入”印度的领土。示威者竟然要中国政府“无条件道歉”，赔偿“侵犯边界”所造成的损失。
    甚至作为执政党的国大党的地方组织也参加了这种对中国极其不友好的活动。据“甘露市场报”消息，国大党加尔各答中区委员会8月30日纠集了一批人到中国驻加尔各答总领事馆前面举行了反华示威。示威前，他们集会抗议所谓“中国的侵略”。国大党西孟加拉邦委员会副主席高希在会上煽动说，对于中国不断“侵入”印度北部边境的事件，任何一个爱国的印度人都不会是消极的旁观者。必须坚决要求“侵略者”离开印度领土。
