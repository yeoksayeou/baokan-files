Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: The call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has transformed into a tremendous material force on the agricultural and animal husbandry production front in the ethnic minority regions across the country.

Many agricultural areas inhabited by ethnic minorities have accelerated their production progress, increased attendance rates, and experienced a vibrant upsurge of competition after holding mobilization rallies. In Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, more than 8,000 members of various ethnic groups in Xinqiao People's Commune, Binyang County, under the slogan of "Late rice exceeding early rice, actual production exceeding contracted production," are engaged in a major battle of late rice field management, launching a "pace-setter expert" campaign. The commune's weeding and topdressing progress has surged from 2,000 mu per day to more than 7,000 mu. Inspired by the Party's battle call, the Yi people in the Liangshan area of Sichuan Province are determined to accelerate their leap forward. Many places have increased their production targets. In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, men and women, young and old, are mobilized, going up the mountains before dawn with dry rations to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer, launching a competition. The Hani and Miao farmers in Jinping County, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, have proposed to fight hard in September, strengthening late-stage field management. The attendance rate in the county has now reached almost 100%, and few idlers can be seen in many villages. Chabuchar Xibe Autonomous County in Xinjiang plans to sow 130,000 mu of winter wheat this year, expanding the planting area by 75% compared to last year. In order to strive for more planting and more harvesting, various communes have rationally arranged labor, reclaiming wasteland and sowing seeds simultaneously. In the ethnic minority agricultural areas of Qinghai Province, highland barley and wheat have begun to be harvested. Farmers of all ethnic groups are closely watching for the impending frost and hail, organizing shock harvests. Young and middle-aged commune members have moved the dining hall to the fields, while the elderly and children have formed gleaning groups, carrying out appraisal competitions for careful harvesting, meticulous threshing, and returning every grain to the granary. Some communes have placed firewood piles in the fields, ready to light fires at any time to resist frost and prevent freezing. The Youth Commando Team of Yuwang Commune in Tongxin County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, immediately launched a fierce attack on third-class seedlings after discussing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, vigorously weeding and topdressing, and upgrading more than 5,000 mu of third-class seedlings to second-class seedlings. Many Miao commune members in Kaili County, Guizhou Province, have submitted letters of determination to the commune Party committee, guaranteeing to overcome drought and strive for overproduction. Miao and Han commune members of the Liming Production Team in Jiuzhou Commune, Huangping County, worked together to lift river water more than fifty zhang high using waterwheels and dragon bone pumps, working hard for a day to free more than 300 mu of rice from the threat of drought. Miao commune members in the Baiduo Management Area of Shibing Commune in this county recently rushed to plant more than 1,800 mu of late autumn crops in two days, exceeding the plan by 1,000 mu. More than 200 Tibetan workers at the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station in Tibet launched a harvest competition to harvest highland barley and wheat, and pick pumpkins, Chinese cabbage, and other vegetables.

At present, herdsmen of all ethnic groups are seizing the good time for animal husbandry production and construction, and have set off a new upsurge of grasping livestock fattening and breeding, storing green fodder, and building sheds and pens as a gift for the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Herdsmen in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are now harvesting more than 20 million jin of grass every day. Zalaite Banner in this league has completed more than 92% of its grass harvesting task. Some communes in Xilingol League have moved their production offices to the grassland to specifically direct the battle to harvest and store grass. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province have launched a mass movement to compare indicators, measures, and enthusiasm in animal husbandry production, ensuring that after winter, large livestock have pens, young livestock have sheds, and all kinds of livestock do not lack grass, changing the past "autumn fattening, winter thinning, spring death" to "autumn fattening, winter fat, spring strong." At the settlement of the Heka Commune in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Tibetan herdsmen wrote big-character posters overnight after listening to the broadcast of the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The grass harvesting team members are determined to harvest 2,000 jin of grass per person before the National Day to ensure that livestock can safely spend the winter. The 50 Tibetan workers in the commune's comprehensive factory guaranteed to produce 2,000 pairs of boots, 300 leather jackets, 70,000 bricks, and 70,000 jin of lime before the National Day to meet the needs of commune members to spend the winter and build houses. Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture proposed to fight hard in September, so that more than 80% of breeding-age female animals would become pregnant, completely eliminate third-class fatness, store 120 million jin of green fodder, and prevent and control animal diseases one million times.
