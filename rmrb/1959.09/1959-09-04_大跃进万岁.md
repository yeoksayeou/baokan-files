Long Live the Great Leap Forward
		By our Shanghai Correspondent

	A New Upsurge Begins

	The sky is high and the air is crisp, and the scenery along the Huangpu River is magnificent. The clarion call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has inspired millions of industrial workers in Shanghai to strive for new victories.

	On this day last year, the Party issued the call for the Great Leap Forward from Beidaihe. At that time, the Jiangnan Shipyard, a century-old factory on the banks of the Huangpu River, built the first 5,000-ton ocean freighter, the "Peace No. 28," at a speed never before seen in the history of shipbuilding in China. This product of last year's Great Leap Forward gained widespread fame, its construction speed surpassing that of Japan, a country renowned for shipbuilding. It raised a red flag at the forefront of Shanghai's leaping workers.

	At this time this year, the Party issued the call for continued leaping forward from Lushan. Once again, this ancient shipyard took the lead, starting on August 20th to hoist the sections of the second 5,000-ton ocean freighter onto the slipway and begin the final assembly. The shipyard workers, having tasted the sweetness of last year's Great Leap Forward and honed their skills, set even more astonishing goals for this newborn in the continued leap forward. Before the end of September, they aimed to shorten the slipway cycle by thirty days compared to last year's seventy days for "Peace No. 28," bringing the speed down to forty days before launching. In recent days, the slipway on the riverbank has been bustling with activity, and the speed of the project's progress is unbelievable. In the morning, one might only see sections of the hull being pieced together; by dusk, huge side plates are already erected high from the bottom plates; at night, the beautiful arcs of electric welding flash dazzlingly.

	Looking across the river, the furnaces of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant are ablaze. Downstream, passing the Yangshupu Power Plant, the Hudong Shipyard, and all the way to the Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant at Wusongkou, thousands of factories on both banks held mass meetings and symposiums, beating drums to go into battle. The shouts of leaping forward rose and fell, and letters of determination and guarantees poured in like snowflakes: to complete this year's plan for continued leaping forward ten days, one month, or even one quarter ahead of schedule!

	The leap forward has never stopped. The new upsurge marks a new and giant step forward for the Shanghai working class on the path of leaping forward. Since the beginning of the year, the Shanghai working class has been full of energy, vigorously engaging in technical innovation and revolution, and improving enterprise management. The total industrial output value for the first seven months has already completed 49.2% of the annual plan, an increase of 52% compared to the same period last year. In early August, the Party's call to "oppose right-leaning tendencies, encourage high spirits, and launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy" added new strength to the people. The masses were in high spirits and advanced bravely. Those who had temporarily hesitated in the face of difficulties awoke from their dreams and quickly perked up.

	Look, records are constantly being broken on all production fronts, and good news pours in. The city's total industrial output value—the overall production level—is new every day and every ten days. The first ten days of August increased by 8% compared to the same period in July, and the middle ten days increased by another 27.79% compared to the first ten days!

	Listen to the good news from the steelmaking furnaces: Steel production in the first and middle ten days of August increased by 30.5% compared to the same period last month!

	A large new converter steelmaking workshop has tapped steel, a new electric furnace steelmaking workshop with new equipment has been completed, an electricity-controlled cement plant has been ignited, a high-precision twelve-roller strip steel cold rolling mill has been produced, a huge 5,000-ton ocean freighter has been placed on the slipway, and special micro-motors with rotors the size of a thumb are also being rushed… Cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and various daily industrial goods are all experiencing large increases in production.

		Without Last Year, There Would Be No This Year

	From Beidaihe to Lushan, from August of last year to August of this year, a bright and dazzling red line runs through the middle. Like the continuation of time, this year's continued leap forward is a new and inevitable development of last year's Great Leap Forward. The two Augusts are inseparable, both writing extremely glorious pages in the history of the motherland.

	Last year's Great Leap Forward laid an extremely important foundation for this year's continued leap forward in terms of material, spirit, interpersonal relationships, experience, and work methods.

	Domestic and foreign class enemies and right-leaning opportunists, closing their eyes, want to deny the great achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward, stubbornly saying that "the whole people running iron and steel was not worth the loss," and fantasizing that "the people's commune plan has already failed." Let them come to Shanghai and take a look!

	Here, one can clearly see the abundant fruits of the Great Leap Forward across the country last year.

	Walking into the stockyards of various steel plants, one sees piles of dozens of types of pig iron transported from all over the country. There are many small wooden signs stuck there, with the names of Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hefei, Wuhu, Chaoxian, Qiaotouji, and many other place names that are difficult to find on the map. In the past, the pig iron used for steelmaking in Shanghai was transported from remote areas such as Anshan and Benxi by train and then by boat. Since the nationwide campaign to run iron and steel began last year, the world has changed dramatically: pig iron has poured into Shanghai from all directions.

	Such a broad source of raw materials is unprecedented in Shanghai since the first steelmaking furnace was established in the late nineteenth century, ensuring the Great Leap Forward in Shanghai's steel industry. Last year, the city's steel production reached 1.22 million tons, more than double that of the previous year. Currently, workers are firmly fighting to complete the state plan of 1.65 million tons of steel for the whole year and strive to reach 1.8 million tons.

	If there were no nationwide campaign of the whole people running iron and steel, how could one explain the huge changes that have taken place in Shanghai in such a short period of time?!

	Let's look at the textile industry again. Shanghai is an important old base in our country, with great potential for equipment. Last year, our country had a bumper cotton harvest, with a harvest 28% higher than the previous year. Although this year encountered severe water and drought disasters, the indicators are still about 10% higher than last year. Large numbers of cotton-laden vehicles and ships are continuously transported from various cotton-producing areas. From September of last year to August of this year, 8 million dan of cotton were transferred from various places, an increase of more than 1.9 million dan compared to the previous production year, creating an unprecedented new record.

		“Ants” Grow Wings

	Last year during these days, people were radiant and everywhere there was creation, miracles, and a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. The working people, who had been excluded from the gates of science for thousands of years, broke superstitions and broke into the "forbidden zone" of science. Recalling it now, one still feels excited in one's heart.

	After last year's training, people's courage became even greater and their style even higher. In the first seven months of this year, the Shanghai working class put forward more than 260,000 innovation proposals, of which more than 140,000 have already been implemented. More than 12,000 new products and new varieties have been successfully trial-produced, of which nearly half have already been put into production. They bravely demanded resources from nature. They turned factories into places where "there is no waste gas in the sky, no waste materials on the ground, and no waste liquid underground."

	Among the thousands of examples, let's just talk about one:

	Near the Huangpu River, there is a quiet and remote small street. On the street, there is a dilapidated small factory called the Jianshe Machine Factory. Last year, it was quite restless here. With the perseverance of "crabs eating oxen" and the method of "ants gnawing at bones," the workers used some indigenous machine tools to process many large parts of converters in advance, which even large factories did not dare to take on—wind rings. This enabled a large converter steelmaking workshop newly built at the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant last year to pour out torrents of molten steel on time. This event caused a sensation throughout the city, and tens of thousands of people flocked to this small factory with just over two hundred people to visit and learn. Premier Kim Il-sung came here, and Deputy Premier Chen Yi wrote a poem to praise it, saying that "this is as moving as the ancient story of Yu Gong moving mountains."

	What is exciting is more than that. This year, this factory has developed last year's technology: The "ants" have grown wings and can fly and jump!

	The originally manufactured indigenous machine tools were special-purpose equipment. Once they completed the converter parts, they had to go to the warehouse to sleep. This year, they released the "ants" from the warehouse and transformed them into general-purpose machine tools: they can process not only the parts of converters, but also the large parts of rolling mills, coking equipment, and fertilizer equipment. And they can be used for multiple purposes: just change the cutter, and they are milling machines, drilling machines, boring machines…

	On the construction site of the ninth team, four "ants" are gnawing at a large part of a fertilizer equipment. They are flexible, able to go high or low, left or right, really handy. Suddenly, one "ant" stopped—the plane it was milling was completed. Worker Zhang Jiqing inserted a drill bit into its head, and then it drilled holes in the large part.

	What is exciting is not only these. Now, some ants are no longer "gnawing" bones, but simply "swallowing" bones. Indeed, in another place, worker Zhang Xianfu also installed four cutters on an "ant" that originally only had one cutter. When cutting, one could only see pieces of iron filings falling one after another. Can you say that this was done by the blind impulsiveness of the petty bourgeoisie?

		Chatting, Laughing, and Consulting

	"The rectification campaign has ended, but the spirit of rectification must never be abandoned." This is a big-character poster written by a worker. In February of this year, at a rally of ten thousand people, Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, said that this big-character poster was applicable to every cadre and called on all cadres to adhere to the spirit of rectification.

	The exciting scenes of last year's Great Leap Forward are still vivid in our minds: how many leading personnel rushed to the front line of production, fought with the masses, and stayed up all night with the masses!

	This year, many leading personnel continued to adhere to this leadership style and leadership method from last year's Great Leap Forward, followed the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, went deep down to lead production in a down-to-earth manner, and led the masses to fight for a common and noble cause. From municipal party secretaries, district party secretaries, industrial bureau directors to factory directors and party committee secretaries, they went down to "serve as soldiers" and participate in labor. Many people planted their experimental fields on "key" areas, and many people worked in shifts with workers day and night like workers. Wherever the most difficult places were, wherever the weakest places were, they were there.

	The Shanghai Oil Refinery has two of the most difficult places: one is the petroleum coke section, which is the hottest; the other is the cold room of the lubricating oil workshop, which is the coldest. Therefore, these two places became the focus for factory leaders to "serve as soldiers."

	Let's just talk about the cold room of the lubricating oil workshop. Outside, it is the hottest time of the year, but inside it is like a severe winter, only about seven degrees Celsius, freezing people's fingers numb.

	Factory director Ma Xiaodi "served as a soldier" here. He put on the same clothes as the workers, went to work and got off work like the workers, and got covered in oil like the workers. He assisted the workshop cadres in mobilizing the masses to launch competitions, so that the shift output soared from about 20 tons to about 30 tons. He found that the workers were developing itchy oil rashes on their bodies due to the corrosion of the oil, so he instructed the relevant departments to make transparent nylon protective clothing for them.

	After the leading personnel of many factories participated in labor, they were rewarded with a leap forward in production and with the joy and high spirits of the masses. The workers put it well: "With the leaders working alongside us, we don't feel tired even if we are tired, and we are full of confidence even if we are in difficulty." In particular, many old workers felt the most deeply. One old female textile worker said with emotion: "I have worked since the Japanese devils to Chiang Kai-shek, and I have never heard of leaders eating, living, and working with us workers, chatting, laughing, and consulting." The old female worker pointed to the statue of Chairman Mao and said: "Today, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are truly leading us well!"

	The Great Leap Forward Is the Wish of the Masses

	The Great Leap Forward is the wish of the people of the whole country, and it is also the wish of the Shanghai working class. The Shanghai working class understands that our country is still poor and blank, and we need to build at a high speed and quickly get rid of the poor situation. The Shanghai working class understands even more that Shanghai is the largest old industrial base in our country, and it bears a very important responsibility in supporting national construction and meeting the needs of people's lives.

	Because they understood this principle, they swept away difficulties and moved forward bravely. Especially since the beginning of this year, although the supply of some industrial raw materials has greatly increased compared with previous years, it still cannot meet the needs of further leaping forward in production. The Shanghai workers fought bravely and intelligently, stubbornly defeating this stumbling block on the road to advancement.

	In the days of continued leaping forward, how many people forgot to eat and sleep, how many people spent sleepless nights, and moving and tearful stories emerged everywhere.

	There is a Meilindeng Pharmaceutical Factory with only forty workers, but the furacilin it produces is a high-grade antiseptic and bactericidal agent, which is widely used and in short supply. This year, the biggest difficulty they encountered was the shortage of various raw materials, which seriously affected production. Waiting for raw materials means that there is no leap forward, and a leap forward cannot be guaranteed without raw materials. Surrounded by difficulties, some people lost confidence and felt powerless, thinking that "we can only do what we can." But the working masses said with high morale: "Without overcoming difficulties, there will be no victory for us!" "Even if there are forty difficulties, we can overcome one for each person, and we can carry a thousand pounds on our shoulders!" The workers, who did not dare to touch chemistry before, made raw materials by themselves. They set up a square table in the corner of the warehouse and bravely picked up measuring cups and beakers to fight the difficulties. Before and after work, groups of two or three studied there, some squatted on the ground drawing pictures, and some wrote equations… Earthen jars replaced acid-resistant jars, and cooking briquette stoves and casserole pots became their tools for experimentation. Later, they simply moved the things out of the warehouse and hung up a sign at the door that said "Workers' Laboratory."

	The strong desire to leap forward and the tenacious will to overcome difficulties conquered one raw material barrier after another, bringing a great harvest in production: they comprehensively overfulfilled the production plan for the first half of the year, and the total output value increased by more than ten times compared with the same period last year. Then they further proposed to complete the annual plan before National Day.

	Looking at the situation on Shanghai's industrial front over the past year, the leap forward developed on the basis of last year, the leap forward representing the wishes of the broad masses of workers, has brought about such huge and profound changes in material production and mental outlook. This change is continuing to develop with the arrival of the new upsurge. Facing this gratifying scene, how can people not shout loudly: Long live the Great Leap Forward!

    大跃进万岁
    本报驻上海记者
      新的高潮起来了
    天高气爽，黄浦江两岸一派大好风光。党的八届八中全会响起了战斗号角，鼓舞着上海百万产业工人，奔向新的胜利。
    去年今日，党从北戴河发出大跃进的号召。那时，黄浦江畔百年老厂——江南造船厂，以我国造船史上从未有过的高速度，建成了第一艘五千吨海轮——“和平二十八号”。这个去年大跃进的产儿，盛名远扬，建造速度压倒了以造船著名的日本。在上海工人跃进队伍的前列举起了一面红旗。
    今年此时，党从庐山发出继续跃进的号召。又是这家古老的船厂当上了急先锋，8月20日起，把第二艘五千吨海轮的分段吊上船台，开始大合拢。船厂工人尝到去年大跃进的甜头，锻炼了本领，对今年这艘继续跃进中的新生儿，提出了更为惊人的进军目标。在9月底以前，比去年“和平二十八号”的七十天船台周期再缩短三十天，以四十天的速度下水。这些天来，江畔的船台上热气腾腾，工程进展的速度令人难以置信。早晨走过船台，还只见一段段刚拼接好的船底；到黄昏，巨大的傍板已从底板上高高竖起；入夜，美丽的电焊弧光闪闪耀眼。
    隔江望去，对岸是炉火熊熊的上钢三厂。顺江而下，路过杨树浦发电厂、沪东造船厂，直到吴淞口的上钢五厂，两岸千百家工厂举行了群众大会和座谈会，擂鼓上阵，跃进的呼声此起彼落，决心书、保证书如雪片涌来：提前十天、提前一个月、提前一个季度完成今年继续跃进的计划！
    跃进从未停止。新高潮标志着上海工人阶级在跃进途中又迈开了新的巨大的一步。年初以来，上海工人阶级干劲十足，大闹技术革新技术革命，改进企业管理，前七个月的工业总产值已完成年度计划的49.2％，比去年同期增长了52％。8月初，党的“反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动”的号召，给人们增添了新的力量。群众意气风发，奋勇前进。在困难面前曾一时畏缩不前的人，如大梦醒来，迅速打起了精神。
    看吧，各条生产战线上不断刷新纪录，捷报纷至沓来。全市工业总产值——生产总水平日日新，旬旬新，8月上旬比7月同期增长8％，中旬又比上旬再增长27.79％！
    听吧，炼钢炉前传出的捷报：钢，上中两旬比上月同期多炼了30.5％！
    规模很大的新转炉炼钢车间出钢了，新式设备的电炉炼钢车间完工了，电力控制的水泥厂点火了，精密度极高的十二辊带钢冷轧机出世了，庞大的五千吨海轮上船台了，转子仅大拇指大小的特殊微型电机也在赶制了……。棉纱、棉布以及各种日用工业品都在大增产。
      没有去年哪有今年
    从北戴河到庐山，从去年8月到今年8月，这中间贯穿了一条鲜艳夺目的红线。像时间的延续一样，今年的继续跃进正是去年大跃进必然的新发展。两个八月，不可分割，双双在祖国历史上写下了极为光辉的两页。
    去年的大跃进，在物质上、精神上、人与人的关系上，在经验上、工作方法上，都为今年的继续跃进奠定了极为重要的基础。
    国内外的阶级敌对分子和右倾机会主义分子，闭着眼睛要否定去年大跃进的巨大成就，硬说“全民办钢铁得不偿失”，幻想“人民公社计划已经失败”。那就让他们来上海看一看吧！
    在这里，可以十分清楚地看到去年全国各地大跃进的丰硕果实。
    走进各个炼钢厂的料场，只见堆着各地运来的几十种生铁。那里插着的许多小木牌，上面书写着无锡、镇江、合肥、芜湖、巢县、桥头集，以及很多地图上很难找到的地名。过去，上海炼钢所用的生铁，远从鞍山、本溪等少数地区，乘火车、转轮船，千里迢迢运来。从去年全国各地大办钢铁以来，就天下大变了：生铁从四面八方涌来上海。
    这样广阔的原料来源，是上海从十九世纪末叶有第一座炼钢炉以来从未有过的，保证了上海钢铁工业的大跃进。去年全市钢产量达到一百二十二万吨，比前年增长一倍多；目前工人们正在坚决为完成今年全年产钢一百六十五万吨的国家计划并争取达到一百八十万吨而斗争。
    如果没有全国的全民办钢铁运动，怎样解释上海在这短短时间内发生的巨大变化？！
    再看看纺织工业吧。上海是我国重要的老基地，蕴藏着很大的设备潜力，去年我国棉花丰收，收获量比前年增长28％；今年虽然碰到严重的水旱灾害，指标仍比去年增产10％左右。大批的棉花车载船装，从各个棉产区源源运来。从去年9月到今年8月，各地调来棉花达八百万担，比前一个生产年度增加了一百九十多万担，创造了历史上空前未有的新纪录。
      “蚂蚁”长了翅膀
    去年这些日子，人们精神焕发，到处是创造、奇迹，是敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格。千百年来被摈之于科学门外的劳动人民，破除迷信，闯进了科学“禁地”。如今回想起来，内心还会激动。
    经过去年的锻炼，人们的胆子更大了，风格更高了。今年前七个月，上海工人阶级就提出了二十六万多件革新建议，其中有十四万多件已经实现。试制成功了一万二千多种新产品新花色品种，其中有将近一半已经投入生产。他们勇猛地向大自然索取资源。他们使工厂变成“天上无废气、地上无废料、地下无废液。”
    万千的事例中只谈一个例子：
    紧迫黄浦江有一条宁静的偏僻小街，街上有一家破旧的小厂，名叫建设机器厂。去年这里颇不宁静。工人们以“蟹吃牛”的毅力，以“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，用一些土机床提前加工出了很多大厂也不敢接手的转炉的大部件——风圈，使去年上钢一厂新建的一个大型转炉炼钢车间按时流出了滚滚钢水。这件事轰动了全城，有几万人拥到这家两百来人的小厂参观学习。金日成首相来过这里，陈毅副总理曾赋诗诵之，赞扬说“这与愚公移山的古老故事同样动人”。
    令人兴奋的何止于此。今年，这家工厂又发展了去年的技术：“蚂蚁”长上了翅膀，能飞能跳！
    原来制造的土机床，是专用设备，一个萝卜一个坑，完成了转炉部件，只好进仓库睡大觉。今年，他们把“蚂蚁”们从仓库里放出来，改成了通用机床：既可以加工转炉的部件，也可以加工轧钢机、炼焦设备、化肥设备的大部件。而且可以一床多用：只要换一换刀具，又是铣床、又是钻床、搪床……
    在第九小组的工地上，四只“蚂蚁”正在啃一只化肥设备的大部件。它们长得灵巧，可高可低，忽左忽右，真是得心应手。忽然，一只“蚂蚁”停下来——它铣的一块平面已经完成。工人张继清在它的头上又插进一个钻头，于是它又在大部件上钻眼子了。
    令人兴奋的还不止这些。现在，有些蚂蚁已经不是“啃”骨头，简直是在“吞”骨头了。果然不差，在另一个地方，工人张显富还把一只原来只装一把铣刀的“蚂蚁”，装上了四把刀，切削起来，只见片片铁屑纷纷落下。你能说这是小资产阶级的盲动情绪干出来的吗？
      有说有笑有商量
    “整风运动是结束了，整风精神永远不能丢掉。”这是一位工人写的一张大字报。今年2月，在一次万人大会上，市委第一书记柯庆施同志说这张大字报对每一个干部都是适用的，号召全体干部一定要坚持整风精神。
    去年大跃进时那些激动人心的场面，还历历在目：多少领导人员奔赴生产最前线，和群众战斗在一起，和群众一起挑灯夜战！
  今年，许多领导人员继续坚持了去年大跃进中这种领导作风和领导方法，遵循市委的指示，深入下去扎扎实实的领导生产，带领群众为共同的崇高的事业战斗。从市委书记、区委书记、工业局长到工厂的厂长和党委书记，纷纷下去“当兵”，参加劳动；很多人把自己的试验田种在“关键”上；很多人像工人一样分成日夜三班跟班工作。哪里是最艰苦的地方，哪里是最薄弱的地方，他们就在那里。
    上海炼油厂有两个地方最艰苦：一是石油焦工段，最热；一是润滑油车间的冷室，最冷。于是，这两个地方成为工厂领导人员“当兵”的重点。
    单表润滑油车间的冷室。外面是大伏天，里面却如严冬，只有摄氏七度左右，冻得人的手指都发麻。
    厂长马小弟就在这里“当兵”。他穿起和工人一样的衣服，和工人一样上班下班，和工人一样的弄得满身油污。他协助车间干部发动群众展开竞赛，使班产量由二十吨左右猛升到三十吨左右。他发现工人由于油污的腐蚀，身上起着痒疼的油疹，便关照有关部门给他们做了透明的尼龙保护衣。
    许多工厂的领导人员参加劳动以后，换来的是生产的跃进，换来的是群众的心情舒畅、意气风发。工人们说得好：“领导和我们在一起，再辛苦也不觉疲劳，再困难也充满信心。”特别是很多老工人，感触最为深刻。有一位老纺织女工感动地说：“从日本鬼子到蒋介石，我都做工，从来没有听说过领导人和我们工人同吃、同住、同劳动，有说、有笑、有商量。”这位老女工又指着毛主席的像说：“今天到底是共产党和毛主席领导得好啊！”
    大跃进是群众的意愿
    大跃进是全国人民的意愿，也是上海工人阶级的意愿。上海工人阶级懂得：我们国家还一穷二白，我们需要以高速度进行建设，迅速摆脱穷困的局面。上海工人阶级更懂得：上海是我国最大的老工业基地，在支援全国建设满足人民生活需要上，肩负着十分重大的责任。
    正因为懂得这层道理，所以他们横扫困难，奋勇直前。特别是今年以来，有些工业原料的供应虽然比往年大大的增加了，但仍然满足不了生产进一步跃进的需要。上海工人斗勇斗智，顽强地击败了这只前进道路上的拦路虎。
    在继续跃进的日子里，多少人废寝忘食，多少人度过了不眠的夜晚，到处涌出可歌可泣的故事。
    有一家只有四十几个工人的美林登药厂，生产的呋喃西林，却是一种高级的防腐杀菌剂，用途很广，供不应求。今年，他们碰到的最大困难是各种原料不足，严重影响生产。坐等原料就谈不上跃进，要跃进得不到原料保证。在重重困难的包围中，有的人曾失掉信心，感到自己无能为力，认为“只能做到哪里算那里。”但是工人群众却斗志昂扬地说：“不压倒困难就没有我们的胜利！”“纵然困难有四十几个，我们一个人克服一个，千斤重担也能挑起来！”从前看到化学碰都不敢碰的工人们，自己动手制造原料。他们在仓库的角落里摆了一张方桌，勇敢地拿起量杯和烧瓶和困难搏斗。上工前下班后，三三两两在那里研究，有的蹲在地上画图，有的在写方程式……瓦缸代替耐酸缸，烧饭的煤球炉、煮菜的砂锅也成了他们做试验的工具。后来，他们干脆把仓库里的东西搬掉，在门口挂上了“工人试验室”的牌子。
    要求跃进的强烈愿望和克服困难的顽强意志，攻下了一个个的原料关，带来了生产的大丰收：全面超额完成了上半年的生产计划，总产值比去年同期增长了十几倍。接着他们又进一步提出要在国庆节前完成全年计划。
    综观上海工业战线上一年来的形势，在去年基础上发展起来的跃进，代表广大工人群众愿望的跃进，已经使物质生产和精神面貌发生了多么巨大而深刻的变化。这个变化随着新高潮的到来，正在继续发展。面对这可喜的景象，人们怎能不高呼：大跃进万岁！
