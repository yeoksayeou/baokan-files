Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: The basketball finals of the First National Games are about to begin, held in Beijing from September 4th and in Tianjin from the 14th. The twelve best men's basketball teams and twelve best women's basketball teams from across the country, who secured the top three positions in the preliminary rounds (divided into four competition zones), have all reported and are sharpening their skills, preparing to compete for the men's and women's basketball championships of the National Games.

The twelve men's teams participating in the finals are: PLA, Shanghai, Hubei, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Beijing, Jiangsu, and Guangdong teams. The twelve women's teams are: Shanghai, PLA, Hubei, Jilin, Shanxi, Guangdong, Hebei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Beijing, Yunnan, and Jiangsu teams.

The finals will adopt a single round-robin system. From September 4th to 27th, each team in both the men's and women's groups will compete against the other eleven teams. The twenty-four teams in the two groups will engage in a total of one hundred and thirty-two round-robin matches to determine the champions. Due to the long duration of the competition and the large number of matches, this will be a great test for each team in terms of physical strength, technique, fighting spirit, strategic thinking, and tactical application.

These twenty-four men's and women's basketball teams were selected from fifty-eight basketball teams (twenty-nine men's and twenty-nine women's teams) in the preliminary rounds after one hundred and eighty-two (ninety-one men's and ninety-one women's) round-robin matches. During the preliminary rounds, the PLA, Beijing, Liaoning, and Sichuan men's teams all won their respective zones with undefeated records. The Shanghai, Beijing, Jilin, and Hebei women's teams also won consecutive victories and secured first place in their respective zones. The entire preliminary process was very intense, with five matches going into overtime to determine the winner.

    篮球决赛明天开始
    男女各十二队将进行一百三十二场循环赛
    据新华社2日讯　第一届全国运动会的篮球决赛即将开始，在北京从9月4日起、在天津从14日起分别举行。获得分区预赛前三名（预赛时分四个竞赛区）的全国最优秀的十二个男子篮球队和十二个女子篮球队已全部报到，正在秣马厉兵，准备争夺全运会的男、女篮球冠军。
    参加决赛的十二个男子队是：解放军、上海、湖北、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、四川、河北、陕西、北京、江苏和广东队；十二个女子队是：上海、解放军、湖北、吉林、山西、广东、河北、四川、贵州、北京、云南和江苏队。
    决赛将采用单循环制。从9月4日至27日，男、女两组每一个队都要和其他十一个队进行比赛，两个组的二十四个队共要进行一百三十二场循环大战，才能决定冠军谁属。由于比赛时间长，场数多，这对每一个队来说，无论是体力、技术、战斗意志、战略思想和战术的运用，都是很大的考验。
    这二十四个男、女篮球队，是在预赛时从五十八个篮球队（男、女子各二十九队）经过一百八十二场（男、女子各九十一场）循环比赛后选拔出来的。在分区预赛时，解放军、北京、辽宁、四川四个男子队，都以不败的纪录获得分区冠军；上海、北京、吉林、河北四个女子队也连战连胜，分别获得分区第一名。整个预赛过程打得十分激烈，有五场比赛经过延长时间再赛才分胜负。
