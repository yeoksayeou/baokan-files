Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 3rd - Famous labor models and representatives of advanced collectives from the industrial, capital construction, transportation, and trade sectors of Heilongjiang Province have published articles in the Heilongjiang Daily, outlining their specific goals and measures to ensure even greater contributions in the continued Great Leap Forward, responding to the great call of the Party Central Committee.

    Su Guangming, a miller at the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant and a pace-setter on the city's industrial front, is already working at the rate of 1969, based on the plant's current advanced work quotas. Now he has proposed to complete another six months' worth of work before National Day with the spirit of a dragon-taming tiger. His proposed measures are: to continue consolidating the fifteen advanced Soviet and domestic experiences already in use, to further study six advanced cutter experiences, and in September, to create five new types of fixtures based on the forty-plus types of fixtures already in use. In addition, he will help the workshop's process assembly team complete the assembly of two milling machines by mid-September.

    Sun Maosong, a lathe operator at the Harbin No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, who has been competing fiercely with Su Guangming, has already completed more than forty months of work from January to August. His newly proposed goal is to ensure that he completes a total of fifty months of work before National Day. At the same time, he will use all available time to pass on his skills to young workers.

    The famous Ma Hengchang team of the Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, inspired by the Party's call, launched a high-quality, high-yield, low-consumption, and safe competition between shifts, people, and machine tools. During the First Five-Year Plan, this team overfulfilled its production task by 180%, and last year completed one year and ten months of work. This year's production task was completed five months and ten days ahead of schedule. Their newly proposed guarantee is: in the third quarter, each person will do the work of one and a half people, the product qualification rate will reach over 99%, and they will ensure no mechanical or personal accidents.

    The Red Flag Coal Mining Team of the Tenth Mine of the Jixi Hengshan Coal Mine guarantees to complete the new production increase and savings plan for the third quarter twenty days ahead of schedule, increase coal production for the country by another 53,000 tons by the end of the year, and save 100 cubic meters of mine pillars under the premise of ensuring safety.

    The famous Ma Yongshun logging team of the Tieli Forestry Bureau had already completed 63,000 cubic meters of timber harvesting from January to July, with production efficiency more than doubling compared to the same period last year. Their newly proposed guarantee is: to complete the annual harvesting task of 85,000 cubic meters before National Day, and to increase timber production for the country by another 35,000 cubic meters by the end of the year.

    Li Rong, a mail sorter at the Harbin Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, has already reached a sorting speed of 10,000 pieces of mail per hour. Her newly proposed vow is: to keep the difficulties for herself and give convenience to others, and to help all the sorters in the bureau increase the speed of sorting mail from the current average of over 6,000 pieces per hour to over 7,500 pieces before National Day.

    Zhang Jiansan, a salesperson at the Harbin Women and Children's Goods Store, a Red Flag unit in Harbin, guarantees to work with comrades in the group to actively explore sources of goods, continue to work closely with the production departments, and better serve customers.

    The 1,191 chartered train group of the Harbin Railway Locomotive Depot hauled more than 20,000 tons of goods in the first half of the year and ran safely for more than 480,000 kilometers. Their newly proposed goal is: to haul 30,000 tons more goods in the second half of the year and achieve 520,000 kilometers of safe and accident-free operation.
