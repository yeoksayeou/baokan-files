Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, September 25th (Reporter Gu Feng): The workers of the Dongfeng large blast furnace at Benxi Iron and Steel Company have demonstrated great skill in their competition with the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's blast furnace workers. Since September, they have achieved an outstanding average utilization coefficient of 2.233, surpassing the most advanced utilization coefficients of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces by 0.057 and 0.158 respectively, winning the national large blast furnace championship. From September 1st to 23rd, this large blast furnace produced 1,123 tons of pig iron more than planned for the state, with 100% quality, and the production cost was also lower than planned. Now, the blast furnace workers are advancing victoriously and have decided to complete the September iron production plan two days ahead of schedule to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.

　　In April of this year, after the Anshan Iron and Steel Company blast furnace workers delegation, headed by the old hero Meng Tai, came to Benxi and signed a red flag competition contract with the workers' representatives of the Dongfeng and other large blast furnaces, the blast furnace workers in both places immediately launched a friendly competition of learning from and catching up with each other to win the red flag. Before August, the average utilization coefficient of the Dongfeng blast furnace was only 1.921, lagging behind Anshan Iron and Steel's advanced No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces. At this time, the workers of the Dongfeng blast furnace put forward the slogan of "Learning from Anshan, Catching up with Anshan," determined to catch up with and surpass the production level of Anshan Iron and Steel's advanced blast furnaces. At the end of August, the utilization coefficient of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 3 blast furnace jumped to first place, and the Dongfeng blast furnace was only 0.163 behind it. Therefore, the workers immediately caught up and sent foremen and furnace workers to Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 3 blast furnace to comprehensively learn from their experience. Combining it with the specific conditions of their own furnace, they actively adopted advanced operating methods such as stabilizing the temperature inside the furnace and ensuring smooth material flow. As a result, from September 1st to 4th, the output of the blast furnace increased greatly, and the utilization coefficient suddenly surpassed Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces. From September 1st to 23rd, the average utilization coefficient of the Dongfeng blast furnace has been leading among the national large blast furnaces.

    学鞍山　赶鞍山
    本溪东风号夺得全国大型高炉冠军
    据新华社本溪25日电　记者谷峰报道：本溪钢铁公司东风号大型高炉职工，在同鞍钢高炉职工展开对手竞赛中大显身手，9月以来创造出平均利用系数二点二三三的优异成绩，分别以高出零点零五七和零点一五八的水平，赶过全国大型高炉利用系数最先进的鞍钢九号和三号高炉，夺得了全国大型高炉的冠军。从9月1日至23日，这座大型高炉为国家多生产生铁一千一百二十三吨，生铁的质量达到百分之百，生产成本也比计划降低。现在，高炉职工正在乘胜前进，决定提前两天完成9月份产铁计划，向建国十周年献礼。
    今年4月，以老英雄孟泰为首的鞍钢高炉职工代表团，来到本溪同东风号等大型高炉职工代表，签订了红旗竞赛的合同以后，两地高炉职工立即掀起了你追我赶、争夺红旗的友谊竞赛。8月份以前，东风号高炉的平均利用系数只达到一点九二一，落后于鞍钢先进的九号和三号高炉。这时候，东风号高炉职工，提出“学鞍山、赶鞍山”的口号，决心赶上并超过鞍钢先进高炉的生产水平。8月末，鞍钢三号高炉的利用系数跃居第一，东风号高炉只差零点一六三就要赶上它。于是，职工们急起直追，立刻派出工长、炉前工人，到鞍钢三号高炉全面学习经验。他们结合本炉的具体情况，积极采用稳定炉内温度、快料顺行等先进操作方法，结果在9月1日至4日，高炉的产量大增，利用系数骤然赶过鞍钢九号和三号高炉。从9月1日至23日，东风号高炉的平均利用系数，在全国大型高炉中一直领先。
