    Capital Concentration of Japanese Monopoly Enterprises
    Lan Hai
    In Japan, capital concentration, which had once declined after the war, has developed rapidly since the United States changed its policy towards openly supporting monopoly capital. Now, industrial production has reached more than 2.7 times the pre-war level, and the concentration of production has largely returned to the pre-war state. With the development of production concentration and competition among various monopoly capitals in technological innovation, new concerns have begun to emerge. The concentration and accumulation of capital have thus progressed. This is the basis for Japan's latent imperialist expansion.
    Production Concentration, Wealth Concentration
    In 1946, when industrial production fell to less than one-third of its pre-war level, the level of production concentration was obviously very low. Before the war (1936), the output of factories with more than 1,000 workers accounted for 26.2% of the total national industrial output. By 1946, this proportion had dropped to 15.2%. However, in 1949, when industrial production recovered to its pre-war level, this proportion had already risen to 28.8%. This clearly shows that the degree of production concentration has returned to the pre-war level. Afterwards, in 1956, when industrial production increased to 2.7 times the pre-war level, production was further concentrated in a few large enterprises. Due to the implementation of the "Law on the Exclusion of Excessive Concentration of Economic Power" after the war, the production concentration in industries such as pulp, paper, steelmaking, and shipbuilding was affected to a certain extent as large enterprises were forced to be divided. But even so, in general industrial sectors, there were as many as twenty-two industries in which more than half of the production was monopolized by a dozen or so large enterprises.
    While production was concentrating, the concentration of bank funds was also prominent. The capital of only seven commercial banks, including Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuji, Dai-ichi, Sanwa, and Tokai, amounted to 34.4 billion yen, deposits amounted to 5,700.8 billion yen, and loans amounted to 5,148.6 billion yen. These three figures accounted for 36.6%, 45.8%, and 42.8% of the total capital, total deposits, and total loans of all banks in the country, respectively (statistics for March 1958).
    In this situation, most of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few large capitalists. According to a Japanese government survey in 1955, it was estimated that among approximately 357,000 companies, only 72 companies had assets of more than 10 billion yen, accounting for 40% of the total assets. If companies with assets of more than 5 billion yen are included, there would still only be 153 companies. However, their assets accounted for 49.5% of the total assets of companies nationwide. In the manufacturing industry, there are now only ten companies with capital of more than 10 billion yen, namely: Yawata Iron & Steel Co. (capital 23 billion yen), Hitachi, Ltd. (capital 22.5 billion yen), Fuji Iron & Steel Co. (capital 20 billion yen), Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co. (capital 15 billion yen), Nippon Kokan K.K. (capital 15 billion yen), Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (capital 12.8 billion yen), Toyo Rayon Co., Ltd. (capital 12 billion yen), New Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (capital 11.7 billion yen), Kawasaki Steel Corporation (capital 10.3 billion yen), and Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. (capital 10.3 billion yen). This massive concentration of capital reflects the unprecedented expansion of the scale of production and is the result of the brutal competition among various monopoly capitalists in which the big fish eat the small fish. According to data from the "Fair Trade Commission," there have been an average of about 500 corporate mergers each year in recent years. In 1957, 398 companies merged, and 135 companies transferred their business rights.
    "Anti-Monopoly Law" in Name Only
    Of course, the above statistics cannot fully reflect the actual situation of capital concentration and accumulation. In reality, in addition to the general trends mentioned above, huge monopoly organizations have also been formed. First, almost all major enterprises in major industries have participated in cartels. Although the "Anti-Monopoly Law" exists, in practice, due to secret cartels, special laws, and government administrative measures, almost all the main contents of the provisions of this law concerning the restriction of cartels have been tampered with. Second, the process of incorporating small and medium-sized enterprises into the "system" of large enterprises has developed significantly. Under the Japanese capitalist system, which is characterized by the exploitation of cheap labor, almost no large enterprise, even one equipped with advanced technology due to technological innovation, relies solely on its own enterprise to carry out production from beginning to end. Enterprises equipped with advanced technology in technological innovation are vying to select some small and medium-sized enterprises and provide them with financial and technical assistance. They do this with the intention of incorporating these small and medium-sized enterprises into the production process of large enterprises, making the two organically combine, and striving to win in the competition by relying on low production costs. This has given rise to a new enterprise control relationship in the form of "systemization." Third, the mutual cooperation and control among large enterprises have been strengthened. The methods are various, such as exercising control through stock ownership, joint investment, sending personnel to serve as senior executives, and cooperating within a certain business scope. Fourth, the integration of the financial industry and industrial sectors has been strengthened. Banks have strengthened their integration with industrial sectors not only through loan relationships but also through stock ownership. The number of enterprises with more than 50% of their shares held by banks increased from 206 in 1953 to 386 in 1957. The shares held by financial institutions accounted for only 9.9% of the total number of shares in 1949, but had risen to 26.1% in 1957.
    Zaibatsu are Reviving
    As mentioned above, monopoly organizations are accelerating their revival. However, the monopoly organizations that have revived after the war have not yet taken on the obvious zaibatsu form of the pre-war period. Before the dissolution of the zaibatsu after the war, Japanese zaibatsu had a clear system of general companies, direct-line companies, and quasi-direct-line companies. The control of zaibatsu families and general companies through stock ownership was extremely strict. Taking the three major zaibatsu, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, as examples, the proportion of shares held by the general companies in the same system companies was: Mitsui General Company 64%, Mitsubishi General Company 48%, Sumitomo General Company 84%; the proportion of shares held in direct-line companies was: Mitsui 70%, Mitsubishi 41%, Sumitomo 38%. However, now the enterprises of the old zaibatsu system do not have the zaibatsu general companies of the pre-war period. Furthermore, although the proportion of shares held by enterprises in the zaibatsu system among each other is increasing year by year, it is still much lower than before the war. Namely: Mitsui is only 12.2%, Mitsubishi is 20.2%, and Sumitomo is 19.8% (statistics for March 1958). In this sense, it cannot be said that the zaibatsu have completely revived.
    However, the zaibatsu are now accelerating their revival. The form it takes is the formation of enterprise groups within the zaibatsu system. The enterprises of each zaibatsu system have organized general manager meetings. This plays a major role in adjusting the mutual relations of various enterprises. The general managers of twenty-one companies in the Mitsubishi system, including Mitsubishi Bank, have formed the "Friday Club"; the Mitsui system has formed the "First Wednesday Club" (24 companies); the Sumitomo system has formed the "White Water Club" (14 companies); the Furukawa system has formed the "Third Wednesday Club" (9 companies). Not only that, but they have also jointly formed export groups or jointly formed common groups to plan the development of new industrial sectors such as the petrochemical industry, the use of atomic energy, and the manufacture of missiles. Mitsubishi and Sumitomo are at the forefront of this corporate grouping, while Mitsui is lagging behind.
    Therefore, one must not assume that the power of monopoly organizations is weak simply because the zaibatsu have not fully recovered. This is because the state monopoly capitalist system makes up for their weaknesses. Monopoly organizations want to rely on the power of the state in various aspects such as finance, financial trade, industry, and labor to ensure high profits.
    New Trends in Monopoly Enterprise Systems
    Since the outbreak of the economic crisis in Japan in 1957, the activities of capital concentration and accumulation have further intensified. Moreover, in the economic recovery that began at the end of 1958, monopoly organizations have significantly strengthened their activities in this area through competition in "industrial rationalization" and technological innovation. It is also worth noting that the system of monopoly enterprises is changing in the process of accelerating capital concentration. For example, the shipbuilding industry, one of Japan's representative industrial sectors, has begun to be linked to the steel industry. Until now, the enterprise system of the shipbuilding industry has mainly taken the form of bank - shipping industry - shipbuilding company. For example, Mitsubishi Bank - Nippon Yusen Co. - Mitsubishi system three shipbuilding companies, etc. However, recently a new system of steel company - shipbuilding company - trading company has emerged. For example, Yawata Iron & Steel Co. - Mitsubishi system three shipbuilding companies - Mitsubishi Corporation, etc.
    Also, in the chemical industry, the concentration and accumulation of capital have been strengthened in conjunction with the development of petrochemicals, natural gas chemicals, and technological innovations such as the steel industry's promotion of the oxygen steelmaking method. The tendency to establish comprehensive chemical conglomerates is also very obvious. Furthermore, the steel industry sector has generated a large amount of waste gas after implementing industrial "rationalization," especially the promotion of the oxygen steelmaking method. Steel companies have begun to supply this waste gas, which is useless in the steel industry, to chemical fertilizer enterprises, strengthening the combination of steel monopoly enterprises and chemical industry monopoly capital. Not only that, but the same tendency has also been strengthened within the steel industry itself. For example, estimating that the demand for stainless steel will increase, Yawata Iron & Steel Co., Fuji Iron & Steel Co., and "Nippon Kokan" Co. are each attempting to place "Nippon Stainless Steel" Co., "Nippon Yakin Kogyo" Co., and "Nippon Metal Industry" Co. under their control.
    After the Western European countries restored the free convertibility of currencies at the end of last year, competition in the world market has intensified, and Japanese monopoly capital will further strengthen the concentration and accumulation of capital in order to cope with this competition. On May 28th of this year, the "Federation of Economic Organizations," a group of Japanese monopoly capitalists, passed a resolution on "Economic Liberalization," expressing its hope that the Nobusuke Kishi group would accelerate the implementation of the plan to fundamentally revise the "Anti-Monopoly Law." In fact, as mentioned above, this bill has long been gutted, but even so, Japanese monopoly capital is demanding that it be fundamentally revised, which shows how urgent its demand to strengthen monopoly concentration is.
    The greatest characteristic of the capital concentration and accumulation of Japanese monopoly enterprises after the war is that it has been rapidly realized in combination with American technology and capital, under American "semi-occupation." Therefore, the development of capital concentration and accumulation, while intensifying Japan's national contradictions, cannot but deepen class contradictions. At present, the Japanese monopoly capital group is planning to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," attempting to reorganize and strengthen the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" system, and strengthen cooperation with U.S. imperialism to realize its latent imperialist ambitions. The Japanese people are launching a strong struggle to oppose the blatant challenge of the monopoly capital group and are trying their best to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism. The increasingly strengthened capital concentration and accumulation will further sharpen the inherent contradictions of Japanese capitalism, and the Japanese economy will be more deeply mired in an unstable situation.

    日本垄断企业的资本集中
    蓝海
    在日本，战后一度衰退的资本集中，自从美国对日政策改为公开扶助垄断资本的方针以来，有了迅速的发展。现在，工业生产达到战前的二点七倍以上，而生产的集中情况已大体恢复到战前的状态。随着生产集中的发展、各垄断资本之间在技术革新方面的竞争，开始出现了新的康采恩。资本的集中和集聚，因而有了进展。这是日本潜在帝国主义的扩张基础。
    生产集中，财富集中
    在工业生产下降到战前三分之一以下的1946年，生产集中的水平显然是很低的。战前（1936年），拥有一千名以上工人的工厂的生产量，占全国工业总产量的26.2％。而1946年，这项比例则降为15.2％。但是，在工业生产恢复到战前水平的1949年，这项比例已经上升为28.8％。这明显地说明生产的集中程度业已恢复到战前的水平。之后，在工业生产增长为战前的二点七倍的1956年，生产已进一步集中于少数的大企业。战后由于实行“经济力量集中排除法”，大企业被强制分割的结果，纸浆、洋纸、炼铁和造船等工业部门的生产集中受到了一定的影响。但是即使这样，一般的产业部门内，过半数的生产由十来个大企业所垄断的竟有二十二个行业之多。
    在生产集中的同时，银行资金的集中也很突出。仅三井、三菱、住友、富士、第一、三和、东海等七家商业银行的资本就有三百四十四亿日元，存款有五万七千零八十亿日元，放款达五万一千四百八十六亿日元。这三项数字在全国银行的总资本、总存款额、总放款额中所占的比例分别为36.6％、45.8％、42.8％（1958年3月的统计）。
    在这种情况下，大半的财富集中在少数的大资本家手里。据1955年日本政府调查，估计在大约三十五万七千家公司当中，拥有一百亿日元以上资产的公司仅有七十二家，占总资产的40％。如果加上拥有五十亿日元以上资产的公司，也不过是一百五十三家。而它们的资产却在全国公司资产总额中占49.5％。在制造工业方面，现在拥有资本一百亿日元以上的公司只有十家，这就是：八幡制铁公司（资本二百三十亿日元）、日立制作所（资本二百二十五亿日元）、富士制铁公司（资本二百亿日元）、东京浦芝电气公司（资本一百五十亿日元）、日本钢管公司（资本一百五十亿日元）、三菱电机公司（资本一百二十八亿日元）、东洋人造丝公司（资本一百二十亿日元）、新三菱重工业公司（资本一百一十七亿日元）、川崎制铁公司（资本一百零三亿日元）、住友金属工业公司（资本一百零三亿日元）。这种规模巨大的资本集中，既反映了生产规模的空前扩大，同时又是各个垄断资本家之间大鱼吃小鱼的残酷竞争的结果。根据“公正交易委员会”的资料，近几年来每年平均都有五百起左右合并企业的事件。1957年有三百九十八家企业合并，一百三十五家企业转让了营业权。“垄断禁止法”有名无实
    当然，上述统计决不能充分反映资本集中和集聚的实际情况。实际上除了以上的一般倾向外，还形成了巨大的垄断组织。第一，几乎大部分的主要产业的大企业，都参加了卡特尔。虽然有“垄断禁止法”的存在，但实际上由于有秘密卡特尔、特别法和政府的行政措施，这项法案中有关限制卡特尔的规定的主要内容几乎全被篡改了。第二，把中小企业纳入大企业的“系统化”过程，有了显著的发展。在以剥削廉价劳动为特点的日本资本主义制度下，即使是因技术革新而以高度技术装备起来的大企业，也几乎没有一家是仅仅依靠自家的企业从头到尾进行生产的。在技术革新中以高度技术装备起来的企业，竞相选定一些中小企业，向它们提供资金和技术援助。它们这样做是打算把这些中小企业编入大企业的生产过程，使两者有机地结合起来，力图依靠低廉的生产费用在竞争中取得胜利。这就产生了一种以“系统化”为形式的新的企业支配关系。第三，大企业间的相互合作和控制加强了。其方式是有各种各样的，如通过占有股票进行控制，共同出资，派人充当高级职员，以及在一定的经营范围内实行合作等等。第四，金融业同产业部门的结合加强了。银行不仅通过放款关系，而且通过占有股票的形式，加强了它同产业部门的结合。50％以上股票由银行占有的企业，从1953年的二百零六家增加到1957年的三百八十六家。金融机关握有的股票1949年仅占股票总数的9.9％，1957年已经上升为26.1％了。
    财阀在复活中
    正如上面所谈到的，垄断组织正在加快复活中。但是，战后复活的垄断组织尚未采取战前那种明显的财阀形态。战后在解散财阀以前，日本财阀都有总公司、直系公司、准直系公司这样一个明确的系统。财阀家族和总公司通过占有股票进行控制极为严密。以三井、三菱、住友三大财阀为例，总公司在同一系统公司股票中占有的比例是：三井总公司为64％，三菱总公司为48％，住友总公司为84％；在直系公司股票中占有的比例是：三井为70％，三菱为41％，住友为38％。但是，现在旧财阀系统企业没有战前那样的财阀总公司。再者，财阀系统的企业相互之间持有股票的比例虽然年年在增加，但是比战前还低得多。即：三井仅为12.2％，三菱为20.2％，住友为19.8％（1958年3月统计）。从这种意义上说来，现在还不能说财阀已经完全复活了。
    但是，现在财阀正在加紧复活中。它所采取的形式，是组成财阀系统的企业集团。各个财阀系统的企业之间，组织了总经理会的组织。这对调整各企业的相互关系起着重大的作用。三菱系统的三菱银行等二十一家公司的总经理组成了“星五会”；三井系统组成了“星一会”（二十四家公司）；住友系统组成了“白水会”（十四家公司）；古河系统组成了“三水会”（九家公司）。不仅如此，它们还共同组成出口集团，或是就发展石油化学工业、利用原子能、制造导弹等新产业部门，分别组成共同的集团，着手筹划。在这种企业集团化的情况中走在最前面的是三菱、住友，而三井是落后了。
    因此，决不能因为说财阀尚未完全恢复，就认为垄断组织的力量软弱。这是因为国家垄断资本主义制度弥补了它们的弱点。垄断组织想通过财政、金融贸易和产业劳动等各方面，依靠国家的力量来保证高额的利润。
    垄断企业系统的新动向
    自从1957年日本爆发经济危机以来，资本集中和集聚的活动进一步加强了。而且，在1958年年底开始的经济回升的过程中，垄断组织更通过“产业合理化”和技术革新的竞争显著地加强了这方面的活动。而且值得注意的是在资本集中加剧的过程中，垄断企业的系统正在发生变化。例如，日本的具有代表性的产业部门之一的造船业，开始同钢铁工业挂上了钩。到现在为止，造船业的企业系统，主要是采取银行——海运业——造船公司这样一种形式。例如，三菱银行——日本邮船公司——三菱系统的三造船公司，等等。但是，最近产生了钢铁公司——造船公司——贸易商行这样一种新的系统。例如，八幡制铁公司——三菱系统三造船公司——三菱商事公司，等等。
    还有，在化学工业方面，同石油化学、天然煤气化学的发展，以及钢铁工业推广氧气炼钢法等技术革新相结合，加强了资本的集中和集聚。建立综合的化学联合企业的倾向，也表现得很明显。再则，钢铁工业部门在实行产业“合理化”，特别是推广氧气炼钢法后，产生了大量的废气。钢铁公司开始把这种在钢铁工业中毫无用处的废气供给化学肥料企业，加强了钢铁垄断企业同化学工业垄断资本的结合。不仅如此，同样的倾向在钢铁工业本身也加强了。例如，估计不锈钢的需要会增加，八幡制铁公司、富士制铁公司和“日本钢管”公司，分别企图把“日本不锈钢”公司、“日本冶金”公司、“日本金属工业”公司置于它们的控制之下。
    去年年底西欧各国恢复通货自由兑换后，世界市场上竞争日益加剧，日本垄断资本为了应付这种竞争，将更加加强资本的集中和集聚。今年5月28日，日本垄断资本家的团体“经济团体联合会”通过了“经济自由化”的决议，表示希望岸信介集团加紧实现根本修改“禁止垄断法”的计划。其实，正如前述，这个法案早已被抽筋拔骨，但即使这样，日本垄断资本还要求从根本上加以修改，可见它要求加强垄断集中是多么迫切了。
    战后日本垄断企业的资本集中和集聚的最大特征，是同美国的技术、资本相结合，在美国的“半占领”下迅速实现的。因此，资本的集中和集聚的发展，在使日本的民族矛盾激化的同时，也不能不加深阶级矛盾。目前，日本垄断资本集团，正在策划修改日美“安全条约”，企图重新改组和加强旧金山“和约”体制，加强同美帝国主义的合作，以实现潜在帝国主义的野心。日本人民正在掀起强大的斗争来反对垄断资本集团的露骨挑战，竭力阻止日本军国主义的复活。而日益加强的资本集中和集聚，将使日本资本主义所固有的矛盾进一步尖锐化，日本经济将更加陷于不稳定的处境。
