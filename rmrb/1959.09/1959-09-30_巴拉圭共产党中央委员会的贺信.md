    Letter of Greetings from the Central Committee of the Paraguayan Communist Party
    To Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, and Comrades of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

    The tenth anniversary of the victory of the great Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China is a festival for the people of all countries in the world, especially for those who are struggling to reach the first stage of the road to socialism, to win national liberation from the shackles of imperialism, and to strive for rapid economic development.

    The anti-imperialist and progressive forces of the Paraguayan people celebrate the tenth anniversary of the victory of the Chinese revolution with joy and excitement, just as they celebrate Paraguay's own victory in the great common struggle of the people of all countries against US imperialism and its running dogs.

    For our people, as well as for all nations striving to break away from colonial dependency and backwardness, the historically significant victory of the Chinese revolution and its amazing progress over the past ten years are inexhaustible sources of experience and lessons.

    When the great Chinese people joined the glorious ranks of socialism led by the Soviet Union in the cause of building a society without exploitation, they unequivocally proved to mankind that socialist revolution is not merely a historical accident suitable for the special circumstances of one country, but the main content of the contemporary era, and the ultimate goal towards which the people of all countries, whether in Europe and Asia or other continents, whether white, yellow, or black, whether large or small nations, are consistently moving.

    After defeating and driving out the most powerful imperialism in the capitalist world, the Chinese revolution proved to all nations striving for independence that this tiger is not as ferocious as it is portrayed, and that it must retreat when the people of all countries, under the guidance of the political vanguard of the working class and Marxist-Leninist thought, have indestructible confidence in their own strength and wage a determined struggle.

    In raising vast China from thousands of years of backwardness to the height of a modern industrial power advancing by leaps and bounds, eliminating poverty, and fundamentally improving the living conditions of hundreds of millions of people, the Chinese revolution pointed out to our people, as well as to the people of all dependent countries, that the road to breaking away from colonial or semi-colonial oppression, liberating productive forces, and opening up an era of rapid progress in agriculture, industry, culture, and people's welfare exists.

    The glorious tenth anniversary of the victory of the Chinese revolution presents the people of underdeveloped countries with the need to compare two roads: the road of begging for "US aid" at the expense of their own natural resources and selling out national sovereignty, which has led many underdeveloped countries, including our own, to economic crisis, political oppression, and extreme poverty; at the same time, the other road, the road of implementing thorough land reform, building socialism, and cooperating with fraternal Soviet Union, has made China a strong, prosperous, and free country, where hundreds of millions of people are masters of their motherland, land, factories, and future.

    The people of underdeveloped countries, including our people, thank the Chinese people for pointing out this path.

    No one can ignore that this "miracle" is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the indomitable determination, heroism, boundless selflessness, political consciousness, flexibility, and humility shown by the Chinese Communists in their daily efforts to lead, organize, and educate the people.

    In our struggle against US domination and its tool—the barbaric police-military dictatorship that has oppressed the Paraguayan people for more than twenty years—we strive to explain to our people why the Chinese people were able to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek executioners and their protectors across the ocean. We strive to utilize the rich experience of the Chinese revolution. We study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong and try our best to overcome the separation of theory from practice in order to guide the masses, especially workers and peasants, along the path of a democratic revolution for national liberation based on our country's objective realities.

    In the struggle against the bourgeois road of compromise with US imperialism and the police-military dictatorship, our Party is pushing the masses along the road of resolute unity and struggle to realize their economic and democratic demands, in order to overthrow the anti-national regime and establish a democratized provisional government.

    These people's struggles have flourished, putting the dictatorship in a deep crisis, teetering under the pressure of the masses. The conditions for carrying out a democratic, land, and anti-imperialist revolution in our country are maturing.

    In this situation, the lessons of the Chinese revolution are of particular significance to our people and our Party.

    Glory to the great Chinese people and the outstanding Chinese Communist Party!

    On behalf of the Central Committee, we extend to you warm revolutionary greetings.

### 巴拉圭共产党中央委员会的贺信

专栏：

    巴拉圭共产党中央委员会的贺信毛泽东同志刘少奇同志中国共产党中央委员会的同志们：
    伟大的中国革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立的十周年是全世界各国人民的节日，特别是那些为达到走向社会主义道路的第一阶段，为争取从帝国主义桎梏下获得民族解放争取经济独立的飞速发展而斗争的人民的节日。
    巴拉圭人民的反帝的进步力量以欢欣鼓舞的心情庆贺中国革命胜利十周年，他们庆贺这个十周年纪念就像庆贺巴拉圭人民在各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的伟大的共同斗争中自己所取得的胜利一样。
    对我国人民来说，同样对所有努力摆脱殖民地附属国地位和落后状态的民族来说，中国革命的具有历史意义的胜利和十年间惊人的进步是我们吸取经验和教益的用之不竭的源泉。
    当伟大的中国人民在建设一个没有剥削的社会的事业中加入到以苏联为首的社会主义光荣行列时，他们向人类确凿地证明：社会主义革命并不是仅仅适合于一个国家特殊情况的历史的偶然事件，而是当代的主要内容，是世界各国人民，无论是欧洲和亚洲，或者是别的大洲，无论是白种人和黄种人，或者是黑种人，无论是大民族，或者是小民族，一致趋向的最终目标。
    在打败并赶走了资本主义世界最强大的帝国主义之后，中国革命向所有争取独立的各国人民证明，这只老虎并不像人们所描绘的那么凶猛，当各国人民在工人阶级的政治先锋队和马克思列宁主义思想的指导下，对他们自己的力量具有不可摧毁的信心并且坚定地进行斗争时，它也不得不退却。
    在把幅员广阔的中国从几千年的落后状态提升到一个向前跃进的现代化工业强国的高度，消灭贫穷和根本改善几亿人民的生活条件时，中国革命向我国人民，同样也向各附属国人民指明：摆脱殖民地或半殖民地压迫、解放生产力和开创在农业、工业、文化及人民福利方面飞速进步的时代的道路是存在着的。
    光荣的中国革命胜利十周年向不发达国家的人民提出他们对这样两条道路进行比较的必要性：靠牺牲本国自然资源、出卖民族主权而乞求“美援”的道路，已经把许多不发达国家，其中也有我们国家，引向经济危机、政治压迫和极端贫穷的状况；在这同时，另一条道路，实行彻底土改、建设社会主义并和苏联兄弟合作的道路已经使中国成为一个强大、繁荣和自由的国家，在这国家里亿万人民成为他们祖国、土地、工厂和未来的主人。
    包括我国人民在内的不发达国家的人民，感谢中国人民指出了这条道路。
    谁也不能忽视这种“奇迹”主要是由于中国共产党的正确领导，是由于中国共产党人在领导、组织和教育人民每天所作的努力中所表现的不屈的坚定性、英雄主义、无限的忘我精神、政治觉悟、灵活性和谦虚。
    在我们反对美国统治及其工具——二十多年来压迫巴拉圭人民的野蛮的警察军事独裁统治的斗争中，我们努力向我国人民说明为什么中国人民能够击败蒋介石刽子手及其大洋彼岸的保护者。我们努力利用中国革命的丰富经验。我们学习毛泽东同志的著作，尽力克服理论脱离实践，以便引导群众特别是工人和农民，沿着根据我国客观实际出发，争取民族解放的民主革命的道路前进。
    在反对同美帝国主义和警察军事独裁统治妥协的资产阶级道路的斗争中，为了推翻反民族的政权并建立一个民主化的临时政府，我们党正推动群众沿着为争取实现他们的经济和民主要求而坚决团结起来进行斗争的道路前进。
    这些人民斗争已经蓬勃发展起来，使独裁统治危机重重，在群众的压力下摇摇欲坠。在我国进行民主、土地和反帝革命的条件正在成熟。
    在这种情况下，中国革命的教训对我国人民和我们党具有特别的重大意义。
    光荣归于伟大的中国人民和卓越的中国共产党！
    我们代表中央委员会向你们致以热烈的革命敬礼。
