Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 7th: Since the communization in Zhejiang Province, the area of mechanical irrigation has rapidly expanded. From the beginning of this year to now, communes across the province have newly purchased more than 32,000 horsepower of water pumps, equivalent to one-third of the total mechanical irrigation capacity of Zhejiang Province over the past decades. Nearly 20,000 horsepower has been installed and put into production. Calculated at 100 mu irrigated per horsepower, the area of mechanical irrigation has expanded by nearly two million mu compared to last year.

Zhejiang Province began to adopt mechanical irrigation as early as the late Qing Dynasty, but during the twenty years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, not much equipment was added. By the eve of liberation, the province had only more than 8,000 horsepower. After liberation, Zhejiang's mechanical irrigation equipment rose sharply, and by 1957, it had increased more than fivefold compared to 1949. In 1958, the province's mechanical irrigation capacity jumped from 56,863 horsepower in 1957 to 91,360 horsepower.

Communalization has opened up broad avenues for the development of mechanical irrigation. Currently, the province has more than 120,000 horsepower of irrigation machinery. Apart from the 22 state-owned pumping stations that own more than 11,000 horsepower, the rest are owned by the communes. These machines are uniformly commanded and used by the communes or production brigades. Most are installed on boats, making them very mobile. They go wherever they are needed, ensuring that the machines are not idle and greatly improving irrigation efficiency. After the Longshan Commune in Cixi County broke the irrigation boundaries of the original advanced cooperatives, the average irrigation efficiency per horsepower increased from 98 mu to 122 mu, and a large amount of labor was also saved. The commune members call this kind of pump installed on a mobile boat, which can drain waterlogged fields, fight drought, and ensure irrigation, as the "Living Dragon King."

With the rapid development of mechanical irrigation capacity this year, communes across the province have drawn a large number of young commune members to learn how to be pump operators and technicians. This year, a total of more than 12,000 pump operators and more than 600 technicians have been trained. Most of them have mastered the operation and repair techniques skillfully. Now, pump operators and technicians are carrying out technical innovations on a large scale, trying every possible means to maximize the potential of the machines. After the Jiaxing Special District launched the movement to irrigate 200 mu of land per horsepower, workers created experiences such as "small machines towing large pumps" and "one machine towing double pumps." Last year, Jiaxing County irrigated an average of 103 mu per horsepower. After these experiences were promoted this year, the average irrigation per horsepower reached 201 mu; individual units were even able to irrigate 500 mu per horsepower. Pumping stations in various regions have also summarized and promoted the experience of using oil-water mixed fuel for diesel engines, which not only saves fuel but also reduces irrigation costs.

### 人民公社便于实现农业机械化  浙江机械灌溉能力飞速发展  今年初到现在，全省各公社新购抽水机三万二千多马力

    人民公社便于实现农业机械化
    浙江机械灌溉能力飞速发展
    今年初到现在，全省各公社新购抽水机三万二千多马力
    新华社杭州7日电　浙江省在公社化后，机械灌溉面积迅速扩大，仅今年初到现在，全省各公社已新购了抽水机三万二千多马力，相当于浙江省几十年来机械灌溉能力总和的三分之一。现在已安装好投入生产的近二万马力，以每马力灌溉百亩计算，机械灌溉面积就比去年扩大近二百万亩。
    浙江省早在清朝末年就开始采用机械灌溉，但国民党反动派统治的二十年中，并没有增加多少设备，截至解放前夕，全省仅有八千多马力。解放后，浙江机械灌溉设备直线上升，到1957年，已比1949年增加五倍多。1958年全省机械灌溉能力，又在1957年五万六千八百六十三马力的基础上跃到九万一千三百六十马力。
    公社化为发展机械灌溉开辟了广阔的途径。现在，全省已有十二万多马力的灌溉机械，除了二十二个国营抽水机站拥有一万一千多马力外，其余都是公社所有。这些机器都由公社或生产大队统一指挥使用，大部分安装在船上，行动很方便，那里需要到那里去，能使机器不闲，大大提高了灌溉效率。慈溪县龙山公社打破了原高级社的灌溉界限后，每马力灌溉效率平均从九十八亩提高到一百二十二亩，还节约了大量的劳动力。这种安在转移灵活的船上的抽水机，社员们因它既能排涝、抗旱，又能保证灌溉，都称它为“活龙王”。
    随着今年机械灌溉能力的飞速发展，全省各公社抽出了大批的青年社员，学习当抽水机手和技工。今年共训练了抽水机手一万二千多人，技工六百多名。他们多数已熟练地掌握了操作和修理技术。现在，抽水机手和技工们正大搞技术革新，千方百计地发挥机器的潜力。嘉兴专区开展每马力灌溉二百亩田的运动后，工人创造了“小机器拖大泵”、“一机拖双泵”等经验。嘉兴县去年平均每马力灌溉一百零三亩，今年推广这些经验后，每马力平均灌溉二百零一亩；个别单位每马力竟能灌溉五百亩。各地抽水机站还总结推广了柴油机用油水混合燃料的经验，既节约了油料，又降低了灌溉成本。（附图片）
