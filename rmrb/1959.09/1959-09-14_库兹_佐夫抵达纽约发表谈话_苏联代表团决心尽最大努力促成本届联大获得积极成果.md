Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 13th -- TASS reports from New York: The Soviet delegation attending the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly arrived in New York on the 12th, along with the delegations from the Ukrainian Republic and the Byelorussian Republic.

	Kuznetsov, Deputy Head of the Soviet delegation and First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, stated to reporters at the airport, "The opening of the 14th session of the General Assembly coincides with the visit of the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, to the United States, which will be immediately followed by a return visit to the Soviet Union by U.S. President Eisenhower. These mutual visits indicate a certain warming of the international climate. Precisely because of this, the news about the mutual visits has been very well received among ordinary people in all countries of the world, including the American people. We have no doubt that the meeting and talks between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States will create a good atmosphere for the fruitful work of the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

	At this session, the member states of the United Nations should carefully study a series of major issues that, to a considerable extent, determine whether the international situation can be improved and whether world peace can be maintained and consolidated.

	The Soviet delegation, full of hope and determination, will make the greatest effort to contribute to achieving positive results. It will make every effort to consolidate peace and expand peaceful cooperation between all countries. If all the delegations participating in the United Nations General Assembly discuss and decide on the items on the meeting's agenda in such a realistic and constructive manner, then it can be expected that this session of the United Nations General Assembly will complete the tasks it faces and will live up to the expectations of the people of all countries and its own lofty responsibilities.

	It is hoped that this session of the General Assembly will study and resolve the issues on the agenda in a spirit of easing international tensions and in a spirit of striving to eliminate the 'Cold War' as quickly and thoroughly as possible. It is hoped that this session can become a watershed meeting in this sense."

	Kuznetsov concluded by expressing good wishes to the American people.

    库兹?佐夫抵达纽约发表谈话
    苏联代表团决心尽最大努力促成本届联大获得积极成果
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：参加联合国大会第十四届会议的苏联代表团12日抵达纽约，同时到达的还有乌克兰共和国代表团和白俄罗斯共和国代表团。
    苏联代表团副团长、苏联外交部第一副部长库兹?佐夫在机场上向记者发表谈话说，“联大第十四届会议的开幕正好是在苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫要到美国访问的时候，在这访问之后，紧接着将是美国总统艾森豪威尔到苏联的回访。这次互相访问表明着国际气候的某些转暖。正是因为如此，关于互相访问的消息在世界一切国家的普通人、其中包括美国人民中间得到了十分良好的反应。我们毫不怀疑，苏美两国政府首脑的会见和会谈将为联合国大会的十四届会议有成果地进行工作创造良好气氛。
    在这一次会议上，联合国各成员国应当缜密研究在相当大程度上决定着国际局势能否改善和世界和平能否保持和巩固的一系列重大问题。
    苏联代表团满怀希望和决心作最大的努力，以求促成达到积极的成果。它将尽一切努力来巩固和平和扩大所有国家之间的和平合作。如果参加联合国大会的所有代表团都这样实事求是和建设性地来讨论和决定会议议程上的各项问题，那末，可以期望，联合国大会这次会议将完成它所面临的任务，并将不辜负世界各国人民的期望和它自己的崇高职责。
    希望联大这次会议会本着缓和国际紧张局势的精神、本着力求尽快而彻底地消除‘冷战’的精神来研究和解决议程上的问题，希望这次会议从这个意义上说来能成为一次有转折性的会议。”
    库兹?佐夫最后向美国人民表达了良好的祝愿。
