Foolish Slander

Since the publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the American propaganda machine has been extremely busy. From the United States Information Service to all kinds of bourgeois newspapers large and small, they have been running at full speed to launch all kinds of attacks and slanders against the Chinese people. They say that China's Great Leap Forward has "failed miserably"; that "not only has there been no leap forward, but it has fallen flat on its face"; that the people's communes have also suffered "setbacks"; that the Chinese have made "major mistakes"; and that China "is in serious difficulty." The USIS commentary published in full by this newspaper today (an abstract was published a few days ago) is a representative work of these slanderers. We suggest that the people of our country take a good look at this commentary, because, contrary to the expectations of its authors and all those who loudly curse China, their curses, due to their disregard for the facts, will only increase the pride of our people and will only add new fuel to our hot competition to overfulfill this year's plan.

American official commentators are trying to make a big deal out of the fact that we have verified last year's production figures and adjusted this year's production targets. They count and count on their fingers, as if they can calculate some miracle that is beneficial to them from this. However, this kind of magic does not exist after all. If you want to write an article on this topic, then there can only be two articles to write: one is called the spirit of seeking truth from facts of the Chinese people, and the other is called the Chinese people are leaping forward and leaping forward again at a high speed that no capitalist country can achieve. That's all, what else could there be!

It seems that American official commentators lack the most basic method of observing things—the method of comparison, or to put it more precisely, they are trying their best to avoid the method of comparison that they are most taboo about. China and the United States, if you want to talk about "miserable failure," "setback," and the like, then who is the one who has suffered a miserable failure and setback? In 1958, China's total industrial output value increased by 66%, while the United States decreased by 6.3%; among them, China's steel output (excluding native steel) increased by 49.5%, while the United States decreased by 24.5%; China's pig iron output increased by 60.5%, while the United States decreased by 17.6%. Our country's grain output in 1958 increased by 35% compared with 1957, and increased by 131.3% compared with 1949, while the United States in 1958 only increased by 23.2% compared with 1949. As for cotton production, our country increased by 28% in 1958 compared with 1957, and increased by 372.5% compared with 1949, while the United States in 1958 decreased by 28.1% compared with 1949. According to the adjusted 1959 targets, China's grain and cotton output this year will increase by another 10% compared with last year's bumper harvest, steel will increase by 50%, coal will increase by 24%.... As for the United States, I'm very sorry, we have no way to compare with your 1959 plan now, because you don't know what an economic plan is at all. Your economic development is staggering like a drunkard, and no one can "plan" its behavior. However, people have reason to ask the gentlemen of the American propaganda organs to answer: if China's economic development is called "setback," "miserable failure," and "falling flat on its face," then what should your economic situation be called?

The gentlemen of the American propaganda organs have also forgotten what they said not long ago. When China's first five-year plan was successfully completed, they expressed surprise and admitted that China had achieved great achievements. A report by the American "National Planning Association" stated that "during the first five-year plan of Communist China, its economic development was very amazing." In 1956, when China announced its second five-year plan, many American bourgeois newspapers called it an "ambitious goal." The "Washington Post" wrote, "The second five-year plan, starting in 1958, is a blueprint for a rapid rise in national income," and China's industry and agriculture "will have huge percentage increases," and China will "move at a doubly rapid pace." This means that the targets of China's second five-year plan are higher than those of the first five-year plan, and therefore the speed of development will be faster. However, after more than a year of the Great Leap Forward, what happened in China? The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has confidently announced that the Chinese people will complete the main targets of this second five-year plan, which is "moving at a doubly rapid pace," two years ahead of schedule! May I ask the American propagandists, since you called China's first five-year plan "amazing" and the second five-year plan "rapid," then how suddenly, when the Chinese people announced that they would complete the second five-year plan three years ahead of schedule, did it become a "setback," become a "miserable failure," and become "falling flat on its face"? The USIS commentary says that the Chinese people seem to have made "major mistakes" and are "reluctantly" "solving this situation"; in fact, it is the American propaganda organs themselves that have made mistakes and are truly "reluctant" because they dare not face the facts and are caught in self-contradiction.

While the American IS commentators are wantonly slandering China's Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, they actually expressed "concern" for the Chinese people. It viciously said, "The people of mainland China will be the biggest victims of this regime's frantic efforts to make up for the losses caused by its mistakes in planning and implementing the Great Leap Forward." The USIS also said that the Chinese people are "resentful" of the people's communes. We Chinese people feel more ridiculous than angry at these slanders. The Chinese people are working enthusiastically for their own freedom and happiness. Whether it is the Great Leap Forward or the people's communes, they are the products of the great will of 650 million people to improve their own conditions most rapidly. With the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, we have obtained more steel, more coal, more machines, more grain and cotton, more industrial products and agricultural products, more schools, hospitals, nurseries, libraries and gardens.... In 1958, the living standards of the people of our country increased by 6.7% compared with 1957, of which the farmers increased by 9.7%. Isn't it extremely ridiculous for the American gentlemen to call all this the great suffering of the Chinese people and "reluctantly" shed a few drops of "sympathetic" tears? It seems that the purpose of this hypocrisy of the American gentlemen is nothing more than to incite the Chinese people to oppose the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. But how can these fools in Washington not think about it, do they really have the ability to incite the Chinese people to oppose themselves?

Just as the Chinese people, under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, are holding high the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes and advancing victoriously, it should be said that it is not strange, but normal, and not a bad thing, but a good thing, that these slanders and attacks are issued from the American imperialists. Otherwise, what imperialism would there be in the world, and what life-and-death struggle would there be between imperialism and the people of all countries? Otherwise, how can people prove that our "propaganda" about imperialism, especially American imperialism, is the absolute truth? Good, "bring evidence," this commentary from the American IS published in this newspaper today is the most recent of thousands of pieces of evidence. The author tells us how the imperialists observe China, observe the world, what they like, what they hope for, and what they fear. In this way, the Chinese people understand from the negative what they should do and what they should not do. The USIS commentary expresses "concern" for the right-leaning opportunists in China, especially a very valuable passage. When right-leaning opportunists and people with right-leaning ideas discover from the USIS article that the worldview, the method of observing problems, and some views on China's Great Leap Forward of the American gentlemen are so similar to their own, what lessons will they learn? Therefore, although the American commentators hope that the right-leaning opportunists will act according to the requirements of the gentlemen on the other side of the Pacific, the result will help them from the opposite side, prompting all those who are willing to correct their mistakes to wake up from their mistakes.

As for the "mistakes" of the American imperialists, they are incurable. Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again. This is the law of imperialism. The American commentators asserted that "there is no reason" to believe that China's verified figures are "more reliable than the originally announced figures," and also predicted that the Chinese people would not be able to complete this year's production plan, saying that "these figures will have to be lowered." This stubborn stupidity is also incurable. Imperialists never believe in or recognize the power of the people, the revolutionary movement, or the growth of emerging social systems. Even when they are forced to admit certain facts, they cannot truly understand these facts themselves. But no matter what they say, China is continuing to leap forward, leaping forward at a speed that the Western world cannot match. At present, good news is constantly coming from all labor fronts in China. This is the most powerful answer to the imperialist slanderers. Let the imperialists chirp and wail like autumn insects, the wheel of Chinese history will crush all the noises they can make, large and small, with a roaring sound, and fly forward!

### 愚蠢的诽谤

    愚蠢的诽谤
    中共八届八中全会文件发表以后，美国宣传机器大为忙碌起来。从美国新闻处起，直到大大小小的资产阶级报刊，都开足马力向中国人民发出各种各样的攻击和诽谤。它们说，中国的大跃进已经“惨败”；“不但没有跃进，反而脸朝下倒了下去”；人民公社也受到了“挫折”；中国人犯了“重大错误”；中国“正处在严重的困难之中”。本报今天全文发表的美国新闻处的述评（前几天已经发表过它的摘要），就是这些诽谤家的一篇代表作。我们建议我国的人民好好看一看这一篇述评，因为，同它的作者以及一切高声咒骂中国的人们所期望的相反，他们的咒骂由于如此不顾事实，只会增加我国人民的自豪感，只会给我们的超额完成今年计划的热火朝天的竞赛运动增加新的燃料。
    美国的官方评论家企图利用我们核实去年生产数字和调整今年生产指标这件事，大做其文章。他们扳着指头算来又算去，似乎从这里可以算出什么对他们有利的奇迹来。然而，这种魔术毕竟是不存在的。如果要就这个题目做文章，那么也只能有两篇文章可做：一篇叫做中国人民的实事求是的精神，一篇叫做中国人民正在以一切资本主义国家所无法达到的高速度跃进再跃进。如此而已，岂有他哉！
    看来，美国的官方评论家在观察事物的时候，缺乏最起码的方法——比较法，或者说得更正确一点，他们竭力回避他们最讳忌的比较法。中国和美国，如果要说什么“惨败”、“挫折”之类的话，那么，遭到惨败、挫折的究竟是谁呢？1958年中国工业生产总值增长66％，美国却下降6.3％；其中钢产量（不算土钢）中国增长49.5％，美国下降24.5％；生铁产量，中国增长60.5％，美国下降17.6％。我国1958年的粮食产量比1957年增长35％，比1949年增长131.3％，而美国1958年比1949年才增长23.2％。至于棉花的产量，我国1958年比1957年增长28％，比1949年增长372.5％，而美国1958年比1949年却下降28.1％。按照调整后的1959年的指标，中国的粮食和棉花产量今年又将比去年的特大丰收将再增加10％，钢将增加50％，煤将增加24％……。而美国呢，对不起得很，我们现在还没有办法同你们的1959年计划相比，因为你们根本不知经济计划为何物。你们的经济发展是像醉汉一样踉踉跄跄，谁也没有办法“计划”它的行径。但是，人们有理由要求美国宣传机关的老爷们回答：如果中国这样的经济发展叫做“挫折”，叫做“惨败”，叫做“脸朝下倒了下去”，那么你们的那种经济状况究竟应该叫做什么呢？
    美国宣传机关的老爷们也忘记了他们不久以前讲过的话。当中国第一个五年计划胜利完成的时候，他们曾经表示惊奇，承认中国获得很大的成就。美国“全国计划协会”的一篇报告就认为，“在共产党中国的第一个五年计划期间，它的经济发展是非常惊人的。”1956年，当中国公布第二个五年计划的时候，美国许多资产阶级报刊又把它叫做“野心勃勃的目标”。“华盛顿邮报”写道，“从1958年开始的第二个五年计划，是一个国民收入迅速上涨的蓝图”，中国工农业“都将有巨大百分比的增长”，中国将“以加倍迅速的步伐赶路”。这就是说，中国第二个五年计划的指标比第一个五年计划的指标更高，因而发展速度也就更快。可是，经过一年多的大跃进，中国发生了什么事呢？中共八届八中全会已经满怀信心地宣布：中国人民将以两年的时间提前完成这个“以加倍迅速的步伐赶路”的第二个五年计划的主要指标！请问美国的宣传家们，既然你们把中国第一个五年计划叫做“惊人”，第二个五年计划叫做“迅速”，那么怎么忽然间，当中国人民宣布将提前三年完成第二个五年计划的时候，就变成“挫折”，变成“惨败”，变成“脸朝下倒了下去”呢？美国新闻处的述评说中国人似乎犯了“重大错误”，它正在“勉为其难”地“解决这一局面”；其实，真正犯了错误的、真正“勉为其难”的，恰恰是由于不敢面对事实而陷于自相矛盾的美国宣传机关自己。
    美国新闻处的评论家在大肆诽谤中国的大跃进和人民公社的同时，居然对中国的老百姓表示了“关怀”。它恶毒地说，“大陆中国的老百姓将是这个政权为了弥补它在计划工作和执行大跃进方面产生的错误所造成的损失而作的疯狂努力的最大受害者。”美国新闻处并且说，中国人民对人民公社是“怨声载道”的。对于这种种诬蔑，我们中国人与其说感到愤怒，不如说是可笑。中国人民是为了自己的自由幸福而热情劳动的。不论是大跃进，还是人民公社，都是六亿五千万人民要求最迅速地改善自己状况的伟大意志的产物。有了大跃进，有了人民公社，我们就得到了更多的钢，更多的煤，更多的机器，更多的粮食和棉花，更多的工业品和农产品，更多的学校、医院、托儿所、图书馆和花园……。1958年我国全国人民生活水平比1957年提高6.7％，其中农民提高了9.7％。美国的老爷们把这一切都称为中国老百姓的大苦大难，并且“勉为其难”地流下几滴“同情”的眼泪，这不是极其可笑吗？看来，美国的老爷们这种假慈悲的目的无非是想要煽动中国人民反对总路线、大跃进和人民公社。但是，华盛顿的这些蠢才们怎么不想一想，难道他们真有本领煽动中国人民自己反对自己吗？
    正当中国人民在中共八届八中全会的号召下，更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜胜利前进的时候，从美帝国主义者那里发出了这些诽谤和攻击，应该说不是怪事，而是常事，不是坏事，而是好事。否则，世界上还有什么帝国主义，还有什么帝国主义同各国人民之间的生死斗争呢？否则，人们怎么能证明我们关于帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的“宣传”是千真万确的真理呢？好，“拿证据来”，本报今天发表的美国新闻处的这篇述评，就是千千万万个证据中的最近的一个。作者告诉我们，帝国主义者是怎样观察中国、观察世界的，他们喜欢什么，希望什么，又害怕什么。这样，中国人民就从反面懂得自己应该做什么，不应该做什么。美国新闻处的述评对中国的右倾机会主义分子表示“关怀”，尤其是一段极有价值的文章。当右倾机会主义分子和具有右倾思想的人从美国新闻处的文章中发现，美国老爷们的世界观、观察问题的方法、对中国大跃进的某些观点同自己何其相似的时候，他们将得到怎样的教训呢？因此，尽管美国的评论家是希望右倾机会主义分子依照太平洋彼岸的老爷们的要求而行动，但结果却将会从反面帮助他们，促使一切愿意改正错误的人们从自己的错误中猛省过来。
    至于美帝国主义者的“错误”，那是无药可医的。捣乱，失败，再一次捣乱，再一次失败。这就是帝国主义的规律。美国的评论家断言：“没有理由”认为中国的核实后的数字“比原来宣布的数字可靠”，并且还预言，中国人民不可能完成今年的生产计划，说“这些数字还要降低”。这种顽固的愚蠢症，也是无药可医的。帝国主义者对于人民的力量，对于革命运动，对于新兴的社会制度的成长，总是不相信，不承认的。即使在他们被迫承认某些事实的时候，他们也无法真正理解这些事实本身。但是不管他们说什么，中国是在继续跃进着，以西方世界所无法采取的速度跃进着。目前在中国各个劳动战线上，正是捷报频传。这就是对于帝国主义诽谤者的最有力的回答。让帝国主义者像秋虫一样振翅悲鸣吧，中国的历史车轮将以隆隆巨响压过他们所能发出的一切大大小小的噪音，向前飞驰！
