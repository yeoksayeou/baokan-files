Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House
To Publish Over a Thousand Comic Books

    The Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House has drafted a selection plan for the three years from 1960 to 1962. During these three years, it will publish over a thousand comic books popular with the masses.
    Since liberation, Shanghai's comic book work has achieved great success. In the past year alone, the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House published more than 350 comic books, with a circulation of over 50 million copies. This is an unprecedented achievement in the history of comic book publishing in China. Many of these comic books are excellent works reflecting the reality of the motherland's socialist construction, and they closely cooperate with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and various political movements. However, because the publishing house only formulated annual selection plans in the past, there were some shortcomings in the editing and publishing work, such as some books being published in a disorderly manner, with confusing content, and of low quality. Now, the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House has formulated this longer-term selection plan to systematize book publishing, paying attention both to timely editing and drawing of themes reflecting the current reality and to planned publishing of some long literary masterpieces, which can effectively overcome past shortcomings. According to this plan, the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House plans to edit and draw more than 500 works with realistic themes, nearly 200 works with classical themes, more than 150 works with translated themes, and 200 works with children's themes. These include the "Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" and "Red Flag Fluttering" painting collections reflecting revolutionary struggle stories; "Revolutionary Martyrs" picture biographies; "Leader Stories" painting collections; "Great Warriors" picture biographies; picture biographies of scientists, writers, artists, and social activists; and literary masterpieces painting collections, etc.

    上海人民美术出版社
    将出版一千多种连环画
    上海人民美术出版社已经订出1960到1962年三年的选题规划草案，在这三年内，将出版一千多种为广大群众喜闻乐见的连环画。
    解放以来，上海的连环画工作，取得了很大成绩。仅仅去年一年内，上海人民美术出版社就出版了三百五十多种连环画，发行数达五千多万册。这是我国连环画出版史上空前未有的成绩。这些连环画中有许多是反映祖国社会主义建设现实面貌的优秀作品，它们紧密配合了工农业生产大跃进和各项政治运动。但是，由于过去出版社只制订了年度选题计划，因此在编辑出版工作中也存在一些缺点，例如有些书出的紊乱、内容芜杂、质量不高。现在，上海人民美术出版社制订了这个较为长远的选题规划，使出书系统化，既注意到及时编绘反映当前现实的题材，也考虑到有计划地出版一些长篇文艺名著，可以有效地克服过去的缺点。按照这个规划，上海人民美术出版社拟编绘现实题材作品五百多种，古典题材作品近两百种，翻译题材作品一百五十余种，儿童题材二百种。其中包括有反映革命斗争故事的“星火燎原”、“红旗飘飘”画集；“革命先烈”画传；“领袖故事”画集、“伟大的战士”画传；科学家、文学家、艺术家、社会活动家画传；文学名著画集等。
