Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 12th: "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today entitled "In Order to Safeguard the Friendly Relations Between China and India and Peace in Asia." The commentary stated that imperialist schemers and adventurous expansionists, headed by US imperialism, have recently launched an anti-China movement around the Sino-Indian border issue. Obviously, they want to sow seeds of discord between China and India, create tension, undermine the spirit of peaceful coexistence, destroy the great friendship and unity of the Asian people, and pave the way for their aggression against this region.

The commentary pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Prime Minister Nehru on September 8 made it very clear regarding the Sino-Indian border issue. The commentary said that there is a border of approximately 2,000 kilometers along the Himalayas between China and India, but this border has not been formally demarcated to date. The so-called "McMahon Line" is a product of Britain's aggressive policy towards the Tibet region of China and is an illegal thing that has not been recognized by any Chinese central government. However, in order to facilitate consultations on the border issue and to resolve this issue, and to maintain peace and tranquility on the border, the Chinese government has strictly adhered to the status quo and has consistently taken friendly actions to deal appropriately with the incidents of Indian troops repeatedly violating Chinese territory.

The commentary said that the above measures prove that the Chinese government has made every sincere effort to maintain Sino-Indian friendship. Experience has shown that as long as both sides adopt a friendly and correct attitude, they can maintain friendship in the border areas and fully resolve all issues related to the borders of the two countries through peaceful consultation.

The commentary said that the Sino-Indian border situation began to become tense after Tibetan rebels fled to India and when Indian troops gradually violated Chinese territory by crossing the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border. This responsibility lies entirely with the Indian side.

The commentary said that although this is the case, the Chinese government, in order to maintain and consolidate the traditional friendly relations between China and India, to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, and to resolve existing problems through friendly consultation, has made and is still making every effort. Premier Zhou Enlai's reply once again proves that the government of the People's Republic of China is adopting a consistent position of adhering to peace and an unshakable policy of good-neighborly friendship.

The commentary stated that the Korean people fully support the Chinese government's proposal and believe that this proposal for resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute is the most correct and reasonable way to meet the interests of the people of China and India and the interests of peace in Asia.

The commentary said that if the Indian government, like the Chinese government, responds to the Chinese government's proposal from a peace-loving standpoint and immediately takes effective measures, it will be able to quickly eliminate the temporary tension created on the Sino-Indian border.

The commentary said that if India does not recognize the fact that the Sino-Indian border has not been determined and attempts to exert pressure on China through military, diplomatic, and public opinion, and imposes its one-sided views on the border issue on China, this attempt will never succeed, and it will also damage the friendship between the two countries and make the resolution of the border issue more complicated and difficult.

The commentary pointed out that expansionist elements and imperialist schemers provoke disputes between China and India because they want to profit from them, which is why they use the Sino-Indian border incident to launch a frantic clamor. The Western imperialist, especially the US imperialist, aggressive bloc's actions of grossly interfering in Laos' internal affairs have clearly exposed their intention to desperately ignite fires in Asia, attempting to stir up the bankrupt "Cold War" and hinder the easing of international tensions. It is no accident that they are launching an anti-communist wave just as Soviet Chairman Khrushchev is about to visit the United States.

The commentary said that the cunning and ugly provocative struggles of the Western imperialist aggressors must not be tolerated, and the common enemy must not be given a gap for aggression. Immediately resolving the Sino-Indian border issue according to the Chinese government's proposal will be a major blow to the "Cold War" advocates who are trying to weaken Sino-Indian relations.

The commentary said that India, together with China, formulated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and set an example in practice, which has made a great contribution to consolidating peace and the friendship and unity of the Asian people. The friendly unity between China and India is of great significance for maintaining and strengthening peace in Asia and the world, and for consolidating the unity of the Asian people.

The commentary said that the peace-loving people of Asia and the world all hope that the Sino-Indian border issue will be resolved as soon as possible through peaceful consultation in order to further consolidate the friendly relations between the two countries and peace in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, September 11th: The Lebanese "Al-Hurriyah" newspaper said in a commentary published today that the current Indo-Chinese border dispute was caused by the position taken by reactionary elements in India on the Tibet incident and their attempt to influence India's traditional policies.

The commentary said, "This dispute can be resolved through peaceful negotiations between India and China, just as other disputes between them have been resolved."

The newspaper pointed out that raising the border issue under the current circumstances can only satisfy the imperialists who are undermining the fraternal relations between the two largest countries in Asia and creating tension between them and in the region. This is why the imperialist newspapers and news agencies are publicizing the Indo-Chinese dispute and slandering China.

The commentary pointed out, "It is regrettable that this publicity and slander has been endorsed by certain Indian government officials, who have issued statements that help to exacerbate tensions rather than help to dispel misunderstandings and existing differences."

The commentary, after reviewing the role played by India and China in the Bandung Conference and the role of initiating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, said that in the past few years, the imperialists have spared no effort to undermine this relationship in order to eliminate their impact on the national liberation movement and on the surging peace movement in this region.

The commentary said, "For the sake of the interests of the people of both countries and for the peace of Asia, the people of India and China will never allow the imperialists to achieve their goals. Today, the world needs the joint efforts of China and India more than ever to defeat the danger threatening peace in Asia due to the situation in Laos, and to firmly deal with the conspiracy instigated by the United States in cooperation with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

The commentary concluded, "Peace-loving people in all countries and those who are working to ease tensions and the dangers of the Cold War hope that the clouds hanging over Sino-Indian relations will dissipate, and that border incidents will be resolved through negotiation and peaceful means, because Sino-Indian friendship is today, as it has been in the past, one of the guarantees for maintaining peace in Asia."

Xinhua News Agency, London, September 11th: The "Daily Worker" published an editorial today saying: Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru and the Soviet TASS statement on the Sino-Indian border incident "completely shattered the West's mass of stupid and malicious lies spread about the Sino-Indian border situation."

The editorial pointed out that the West's "first lie is to insist that the entire dispute was caused by 'Chinese aggression (against) the Indian border'." The editorial said: "Zhou Enlai first pointed out that the border has never been formally demarcated; second, the 'McMahon Line' mentioned by the Indians is the product of British imperialist aggression; third, although China does not recognize the 'McMahon Line,' the Chinese army has never crossed this line; fourth, it is actually Indian troops who have crossed this line and entered Chinese territory."

The editorial went on to say that the West's "second lie is that China deliberately provoked India on the eve of Khrushchev's visit to the United States in order to worsen the international situation. According to this absurd argument, it seems that China is 'afraid' that the Soviet Union and the United States might reach some understanding on easing tensions. Who is really afraid? It is clear that this is an example of blaming others for one's own mistakes. Socialist China is not Adenauer's Germany or de Gaulle's France. Due to the internal contradictions of imperialism, the governments of West Germany and France are afraid that the Soviet Union and the United States will reach an agreement that will undermine their position in the Cold War system."

The editorial emphasized, "Premier Zhou Enlai's letter shows that China has made the greatest efforts to avoid the deterioration of the situation."

The editorial said that the West's third lie is: "Khrushchev really wanted to aggravate the tension before his visit to the United States, and he was the mastermind behind the events on the Indian-Chinese border and in Laos." The editorial pointed out, "However, the Soviet statement shows that the Soviet leaders fully agree with China's desire to achieve a peaceful solution to the Sino-Indian border issue through negotiations."

The editorial emphasized that "For many years, US imperialism, in cooperation with reactionary elements in India, has been trying to worsen Indian-Chinese relations. Such an attitude can only harm India's highest interests. 'The Daily Telegraph' pointed out yesterday that China's argument is 'persuasive,' that is, the McMahon Line was determined by British imperialism when China itself was a victim of Western imperialism. But 'The Daily Telegraph' raises this point only to suggest that Mr. Nehru's past opposition to British imperialism was foolish, and to suggest that it would be wise for him to change this attitude in the future. When a Conservative newspaper says such things, everyone who opposes imperialism, whether in India or elsewhere, will understand how important it is to immediately and actively respond to Zhou Enlai's call to maintain Sino-Indian friendship."

### 朝鲜、黎巴嫩和英国公正舆论指出  中国为维护中印友谊尽了一切努力  借边界问题攻击和诬蔑中国只会使帝国主义满意

    朝鲜、黎巴嫩和英国公正舆论指出
    中国为维护中印友谊尽了一切努力
    借边界问题攻击和诬蔑中国只会使帝国主义满意
    新华社平壤12日电  “民主朝鲜报”今天发表了题为“为了维护中印间的友好关系和亚洲和平”的评论。评论说，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阴谋家和冒险的扩张主义者，最近围绕着中印边界问题掀起了反华运动。很显然，他们要撒下中印间不和的种子，制造紧张局势，损害和平共处的精神，破坏亚洲人民的伟大友谊和团结，开辟它们对这个地区的侵略道路。
    评论指出，关于中印边界问题，周恩来总理在9月8日给尼赫鲁总理的复信中交代的很清楚。评论说，中印间有沿着喜马拉雅山的长达约二千公里的边界，但是，至今尚未正式划定过这个边界。所谓“麦克马洪线”是英国对中国西藏地区执行侵略政策的产物，是未经过任何一个中国中央政府承认的非法的东西。但是，中国政府为了便于就边界问题进行协商和使这个问题获得解决，为了维护边界的安宁，严格地遵守了现状，对印军屡次侵犯中国领土的事件也一贯以友好的行动，适当地逐个加以处理。
    评论说，上述措施证明，中国政府为了维护中印友谊尽了一切有诚意的努力。经验证明，只要双方采取友好而正当的态度，就能够维持边界地区的友谊，也能用和平协商的方法充分解决有关两国边界的一切问题。
    评论说，但是，中印边界局势在西藏叛乱分子逃到印度以后，在印军越过中印边界东部地区逐渐侵犯中国领土的时候开始紧张起来了。这一责任完全在于印度方面。
    评论说，事实虽然如此，中国政府为了维护和巩固中印间的传统的友谊关系，为了维护亚洲和世界和平，为了用友好协商的方法来解决既存的问题，曾经进行了并且目前还在进行着百般的努力。周恩来总理的复信又一次证明了中华人民共和国政府采取的是一贯坚持爱好和平的立场和不可动摇的睦邻友好政策。
    评论表示，朝鲜人民完全支持中国政府的建议，并且认为，这一解决中印边界争端的建议，是符合中印两国人民的利益和亚洲和平利益的最正当而合理的办法。
    评论说，如果印度政府也同中国政府一样，从爱好和平的立场出发来响应中国政府的建议，并且立即采取有效措施的话，就能够很快地消除在中印边界造成的一时的紧张局面。
    评论说，但是，如果印度不承认中印边界尚未确定的事实，而企图通过军事、外交和社会舆论对中国施加压力，把自己对于边界问题的片面主张强加于中国的话，这种企图是决不能成功的，而且也将破坏两国间的友谊，使边界问题的解决更加复杂化和困难。
    评论指出，扩张主义分子和帝国主义阴谋家挑起中印间的争端，是想从中取利，这就是他们为什么要利用中印边界事件来掀起疯狂的叫嚣。西方帝国主义特别是美帝国主义侵略集团在粗暴地干涉老挝内政的行动中已经明显地暴露它们要在亚洲拼命点火，企图煽起已经破了产的“冷战”，阻挠国际紧张局势趋向缓和。他们正当苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫即将访问美国的时候，掀起反共浪潮绝不是偶然的。
    评论说，绝不能容许西方帝国主义侵略者的这种狡猾的丑恶的挑衅性的挣扎，绝不能给共同的敌人以侵略的间隙。根据中国政府的建议立即解决中印边界问题，将是对企图削弱中印关系的“冷战”鼓吹者的一个很大的打击。
    评论说，印度同中国一道制订了和平共处五项原则，并且在实践中作出了榜样，这对巩固和平和亚洲人民的友谊和团结作出了很大的贡献。中国和印度两国的友好团结，对维护和加强亚洲和全世界的和平，对巩固亚洲人民的团结有着重要意义。
    评论说，亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民，都希望以和平协商的方法早日解决中印边界问题，以便进一步巩固两国的友好关系和亚洲的和平。
    新华社贝鲁特11日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”在今天发表的评论中说，目前的印中边界争端是印度反动分子在西藏事件上所采取的立场以及他们设法影响印度传统的政策的企图所造成的。
    评论说，“这种争端是能够通过印度和中国之间的和平谈判予以解决的。就像它们之间的其它纠纷已经获得解决一样”。
    这家报纸指出，在目前的情况下提出边境问题，只能使正在破坏亚洲这两个最大国家之间的兄弟关系并且在它们之间和这个地区制造紧张局势的帝国主义者感到满意。这就是帝国主义报纸和通讯社为什么对印中纠纷大肆宣扬并且对中国进行污蔑的原因。
    评论指出，“这种宣扬和污蔑得到了某些印度政府人士的赞同，他们发表了有助于加剧紧张局势而不是有助于消除误解和现有分歧的声明，这是令人感到遗憾的事情。”
    评论在回顾印度和中国对万隆会议所起的作用以及倡议和平共处五项原则的作用后说，在过去这些年间，帝国主义曾经不遗余力地设法破坏这种关系，以便消除它们对民族解放运动以及对这个地区波澜壮阔的和平运动的影响。
    评论说，“为了两国人民的利益和为了亚洲的和平，印度和中国两国人民将决不允许帝国主义分子实现他们的目的。今天，世界比任何其他时候更需要中国和印度的联合努力来击败由于老挝的局势而威胁亚洲和平的危险，并且坚定地对付在东南亚条约组织的合作下美国所策动的阴谋。”
    评论最后说，“爱好和平的各国人民以及为缓和紧张局势和冷战危险而努力的那些人希望，笼罩着中印关系的乌云将能消失，边境事件将能通过谈判和和平手段得到解决，因为中印友谊今天和过去任何时候一样是维护亚洲和平的保证之一。”
    新华社伦敦11日电　“工人日报”今天发表社论说：周恩来总理写给尼赫鲁总理的信以及苏联塔斯社就中印边境事件发表的声明，“彻底粉碎了西方对中印边境形势所散播的大量的愚蠢的和恶意的谎言”。
    社论指出，西方“第一个谎言是硬说全部纠纷是由于‘中国侵略（印度）边境’造成的”。社论说：“周恩来首先指出，边界从未正式划定；其次，印度人所说的‘麦克马洪线’是英帝国主义侵略的产物；第三，中国虽然不承认‘麦克马洪线’，但是中国军队从没有越过这条线；第四，实际上越过这条线而进入中国境内的是印度的军队”。
    社论接着说，西方“第二个谎言是，中国故意在赫鲁晓夫访问美国前夕向印度挑衅，以便使国际局势恶化。按照这种愚蠢的论断，似乎中国‘害怕’苏联和美国可能达成某种缓和紧张局势的谅解。到底是谁害怕呢？很清楚，这是把自己的过错归咎于他人的一个例子。社会主义的中国不是阿登纳的德国或戴高乐的法国。由于帝国主义内部的矛盾，西德和法国的政府才害怕苏联和美国达成将会破坏它们在冷战体制中的地位的协议。”
    社论强调指出，“周恩来总理的信件表明，中国已经作了最大的努力以避免局势的恶化。”
    社论说，西方第三个谎言是：“赫鲁晓夫的确希望在他访问美国前夕加剧紧张局势，他是在印中边境和老挝发生的事件的幕后操纵者”。社论指出，“但是，苏联的声明表明，中国希望通过谈判以取得和平解决中印边界问题的愿望，得到了苏联领导人的完全赞同。”
    社论强调说，“多年来，美帝国主义在印度反动分子的合作下一直在设法使印中关系恶化。这样一种态度只能危害印度的最高利益。‘每日电讯报’昨天指出中国的论证‘是有说服力的’，那就是，麦克马洪线是英帝国主义在中国本身还是西方帝国主义的受害者的时候确定的。但是‘每日电讯报’提出这一点只是为了暗示，尼赫鲁先生过去反对英帝国主义是愚蠢的，并且暗示他在将来改变这种态度是明智的。当一家保守党的报纸说这样的话的时候，一切反对帝国主义的人，不论他们是在印度还是在别的地方，都会明白，立即和积极地响应周恩来提出的维护中印友谊的号召有着多么重大的意义。”
