To fight for a bumper wheat harvest next year:

    Henan Province Accumulates Fertilizer and Builds Water Conservancy for Autumn Planting
    Gansu Does a Good Job in Preparing for Wheat Planting

    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to sow winter wheat well, various areas in Henan Province have launched a movement to accumulate and produce fertilizer and build water conservancy projects. By the end of August, the province had prepared 320 billion jin of base fertilizer, averaging about 4,000 jin per mu. Combining this with the drought resistance movement, the province had opened more than 160,000 channels and dug more than 900,000 wells. Currently, more than 13 million mu of land has been plowed.

    This year, the province plans to sow 80 million mu of wheat, 7 million mu more than last year. Among them, wheat accounts for 70 million mu, and large-scale high-yield fields are required to account for 20%-30%. After publicizing the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on a large scale, the Kaifeng Special District saw a general upsurge in production. The people of the district wrote 3 million big-character posters and put forward more than 2.6 million suggestions, resolutely demanding to plant wheat well and striving to over fulfill the sowing plan of 18.8 million mu.

    The communes in Changyuan County have also unified the arrangement of production and labor, forming two teams for accumulating fertilizer and deep plowing the land, with secretaries taking the lead at all levels. More than 80,000 laborers are dispatched daily to accumulate fertilizer. By mid-August, more than 8,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu had been prepared for 700,000 mu of wheat. In the land plowing movement, "large-scale corps operations" were implemented, with 25,000 laborers投入 deep plowing. As of September 2, the county had deeply plowed 92,160 mu, generally to a depth of eight inches or more.

    Selecting fine varieties and rational close planting are effective measures for increasing wheat production in Henan. In mid-August, Anyang County convened a meeting of party branch secretaries, captains, old farmers, middle-aged people, young people, "native experts," and scientific and technical personnel from key production brigades to discuss the issue of rational close planting. The participants generally believed that to ensure that the yield per mu of wheat increases from 210 jin this year to 300 jin, the number of plants per mu must be increased from 270,000 this year to 400,000. Therefore, rational close planting must be further implemented, but it must be adapted to local conditions, seasons, and varieties.

    On the basis of basic seed improvement, the province also continued to expand the "Nanda 2419" fine variety by 10 million mu and the Bima No. 4, Baiyupi, and "Pingyuan 50" fine varieties by 5 million mu, adapting to local conditions. To prevent variety homogenization, prevent natural disasters, and facilitate phased harvesting, communes and production teams generally choose to plant three or more excellent varieties with different maturity periods. Tanghe, Xinye, Dengxian, Fangcheng, Neixiang, Tongbai and other counties in Nanyang District also mobilized communes and teams to adjust 1.16 million jin of wheat seeds among themselves.

    (Reported by this newspaper) This year, the preparation work for sowing winter wheat in Gansu is tight, started early, progressing fast, and of good quality. Starting in early July, the Party committees of the communes in the winter wheat producing areas listed sowing winter wheat well as one of the central tasks of agricultural production. The communes determined the winter wheat sowing area and actively prepared labor, animal power, and farm tools. As of the end of August, all 10 million mu of winter wheat land planned to be sown this year had been plowed, of which 1.17 million mu had been deeply plowed two or three times, with a depth of about one chi [Chinese foot]. The province accumulated 79.1 billion jin of fertilizer and produced 500 million jin of local chemical fertilizer. 150 million jin of seeds had been selected. Various places also repaired and purchased a large number of new seeders.

    Recently, local Party committees formed inspection and evaluation teams to go deep into the fields to check the plowed land plot by plot and accept it mu by mu. In Tianshui Special District alone, 20,000 people participated in the inspection and evaluation teams to inspect the plowed land of more than 3,000 production teams.

    The publication of the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party aroused the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, and labor efficiency was significantly improved. In mid-to-late August, the progress of deep plowing of land in various places increased by two to five times compared with the first ten days of the month, and the amount of fertilizer accumulation increased by 21%. The youth of the Sanba Production Brigade of the Jiaojiazhuang Commune in Yongchang County, responding to the Party's great call, accumulated a large amount of fertilizer after five days of hard work and transported it all to the fields.

    In order to change the unbalanced conditions among the communes and production teams, Party committees at all levels universally strengthened their leadership over the weak communes and production teams: on the one hand, they enthusiastically supported them with plowing livestock, labor, tools, and seeds according to the principle of "equal value exchange"; on the other hand, they sent working groups to stay at fixed points and take responsibility for helping to change the backward situation, keep up with the advanced, and not miss the sowing season. For example, the Jingchuan County Committee organized five working groups and went to the backward teams of five communes, including Yudu, Baishu, Chicheng, and Chaona, to speed up the progress of the sowing preparation work.

    This year, during the hot season, many areas in Gansu had thorough rains, and the soil moisture was very good. Mountain communes repaired mountain canals and diverted water for irrigation, and plain areas also diverted floodwaters for irrigation on a large scale.

    为明年小麦丰收大战今朝
    河南省为秋播积肥和兴修水利
    甘肃小麦播种准备工作搞得好
    本报讯　为播好冬麦，河南省各地掀起积肥造肥和水利建设运动。到8月底止，全省已准备了底肥三千二百亿斤，每亩平均约四千斤；结合抗旱运动，全省已开渠道十六万多条，打水井九十多万眼；目前已翻耕土地一千三百多万亩。
    今年全省计划播麦面积八千万亩，比去年多播七百万亩。其中小麦七千万亩，要求大面积丰产方占到20％—30％。开封专区在大张旗鼓宣传党的八届八中全会公报后，全区普遍出现了生产高潮，全区人民共写大字报三百万张，提建议二百六十多万条，坚决要种好小麦，并力争超额完成一千八百八十万亩的播种计划。
    长垣县各公社还统一安排生产和劳力，把积肥、深翻土地组成两套人马，层层都有书记挂帅，每日出动积肥的有八万余名劳力，到8月中旬，七十万亩小麦每亩已备好底肥八千多斤；在翻地运动中，实行“大兵团作战”，全县投入深耕、深翻地的劳力有两万五千人。到9月2日，全县已经深翻深耕九万二千一百六十亩，深度一般在八寸以上。
    选用良种，合理密植，是河南小麦增产的有效措施。安阳县8月中旬召开了重点生产大队党支部书记、队长、老农、中年、青年、“土专家”和科学技术人员会议，座谈关于合理密植问题，与会人员普遍认为：要保证小麦亩产由今年的二百一十斤增长到三百斤，就必须由今年每亩二十七万株增加到四十万株，因此要进一步贯彻合理密植，但必须掌握因地、因季节、因品种制宜。
    全省还在基本良种化的基础上，因地制宜继续扩大“南大2419”良种一千万亩，碧蚂四号、白玉皮、“平原50”良种五百万亩。各地公社、生产队为防止品种单一化，预防自然灾害和利于分期收获，一般都选择种植三个以上成熟期不同的优良品种。南阳专区的唐河、新野、邓县、方城、内乡、桐柏等县还发动社、队互相调剂了麦种一百一十六万斤。

    本报讯　今年甘肃冬小麦播种的准备工作抓的紧、动手早、进度快、质量好。从7月初开始，冬麦产区的各公社党委即把种好冬麦列为农业生产的中心任务之一。各公社确定了冬麦播种面积和积极准备劳力、畜力、农具。截至8月底，今年全省计划播种的一千万亩冬麦地，已全部进行了耕翻，其中有一百十七万亩深翻过两、三遍，深度达一尺左右；全省积肥七百九十一亿斤，制造土化肥五亿斤；一亿五千万斤种子已选好；各地还整修和购置了大批新式播种机。
    近一时期，各地党委组成检查评比团，深入田间，对翻耕地进行块块检查，亩亩验收。仅天水专区就有两万人参加检查评比团，对三千多个生产队的翻耕地作了检查。
    党的八届八中全会公报发表后，激起了群众冲天干劲，劳动效率显著提高。8月中、下旬各地深翻土地的进度比上旬增长了二至五倍，积肥量增长21％。永昌县焦家庄公社三坝生产大队青年，响应党的伟大号召，经过五天苦战，积了大批肥料，并已全部运送到田里。
    为了改变各公社、生产队之间条件不平衡的状况，各级党委普遍加强了对薄弱公社、生产队的领导：一面按照“等价交换”的原则，组织耕畜、劳力、工具、籽种给予热情支援；一面派出工作组住点包干，帮助改变落后面貌，跟上先进，不误播种时机。如泾川县委组织了五个工作组，分赴玉都、柏树、赤城、朝那等五个公社的落后队，加快了播种准备工作的进度。
    今年伏天，甘肃许多地区都下了透雨，地墒很好，山区公社整修上山渠道，引水灌溉，平川地区还大面积的引洪浇地。
