Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 6th - The millions of rural cadres and commune members in Zhejiang Province, responding to the Party Central Committee's battle call, have launched an increase production and economizing movement centered on late rice surpassing early rice and late-ripening crops surpassing early-ripening crops. After nearly a month of hard work, they have already won the first round victory in seizing a bumper autumn harvest. By the end of August, most of the province's nearly 11 million mu of single-season, intercropped, and successive-cropped late rice had been top-dressed twice, a few had been top-dressed three times, most had been weeded twice, and some had been weeded three to four times. After several comprehensive and intensive prevention and control efforts, diseases and insect pests of late autumn crops have been greatly reduced. A few days ago, Zhejiang Province had widespread rainfall, and the drought affecting 1.57 million mu of crops has been largely relieved. The province's 2.15 million mu of autumn sweet potatoes, autumn corn, and other coarse grains have also undergone fertilization, weeding, and earthing-up. Many local commune members have said that the characteristic of this autumn's field management is that it is early, diligent, and good.

Currently, autumn crops in Zhejiang Province are lush green and growing well. Late rice has early tillering and many tillers. First-class seedlings generally have more than 400,000 seedlings, second-class seedlings have 300,000 to 350,000 seedlings, and third-class seedlings also have more than 250,000 seedlings. Single-season late rice has already headed, and successive-cropped late rice has rounded stems and jointed. Summer sweet potatoes generally weigh about one jin. The province's 1.8 million mu of cotton plants are densely spaced, bearing abundant fruit, and the early bolls in the Wenzhou area have begun to be harvested, soon entering peak harvest. The 600,000 mu of ramie stalks are tall and strong, and will soon be harvested and stripped. This is another great victory on Zhejiang Province's agricultural front this year, following the bumper harvests of spring flowers and early rice.

The publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has brought tremendous encouragement and strength to the people of Zhejiang. The broad masses of rural cadres and the masses are determined to make persistent efforts, wage a great battle in September, and reap the fruits of the Great Leap Forward. 124 communes in Jiaxing Prefecture have successively held mass meetings, put forward the fighting goals of exceeding contracted production and exceeding planning, and strive to achieve late rice yields of 700 to 1,000 jin. In the past four days, the number of people working in the entire prefecture has increased from more than 1.37 million people per day to more than 1.42 million people, accumulating a total of 16.32 million dan of various high-quality fertilizers, which have been quickly applied to more than 535,000 mu of successive-cropped late rice fields. Jinhua Prefecture is grasping the accumulation of fertilizer and the cultivation of late autumn miscellaneous grain crops, with more than half having been cultivated three times and most having been cultivated twice. Due to a strong typhoon landing in Fujian Province recently, Pingyang, Ruian, Taishun and other counties in the southeast of Wenzhou Prefecture have experienced heavy wind and rain. The broad masses of people are fully engaged in drainage and seedling washing. The Wenzhou Prefectural Committee requires all localities to seize the time to weed, fertilize, and control insects, and requires late rice to be weeded and fertilized once more on the basis of three times of weeding and fertilizing, striving to achieve a bumper harvest of late autumn crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th - The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party are inspiring the four million people of Jinbei Prefecture in Shanxi Province. In recent days, communes, management areas, and production teams have held meetings, analyzed the current favorable situation, and revised production increase plans, striving to overproduce more to respond to the Party's call. A new situation of universally improved attendance rate, production efficiency, and quality has emerged in the entire prefecture. For example, the attendance rate of male and female commune members in Yanggao County's people's communes has now reached more than 95%, and labor efficiency and work quality have also been significantly improved. Autumn field management work is being done quickly and well.

This year, the people's communes in Jinbei Prefecture have overcome various natural disasters such as drought, flood, disease, and insect pests, and grain and various economic crops have generally grown well. The Party's call has further encouraged the confidence of the broad masses of cadres and commune members in overproduction. They have revised the production increase targets and are determined to ensure that this year's grain output in the entire region exceeds the original contracted production target by 20% or even more. At present, the people of the entire region are investing greater effort in the overproduction competition movement centered on strengthening late-stage field management. In Xinding County, the people's communes have 330,000 mu of corn, millet, sorghum, and other crops that are about to mature. Commune members are seizing the recent opportunity to hoe again, and more than 110,000 mu have also been top-dressed. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, commune members of the Sun Rising People's Commune in Jingle County increased the labor force invested in autumn field management from more than 2,750 in the past to more than 3,800. They fought continuously for five days, weeding 19,500 mu, pressing 341,000 dan of green manure, rushing to plant 336 mu of autumn vegetables, and sowing 500 mu of forage grass for livestock. Inspired by the resolution, commune members in the Nantuling and other seven management areas of the Nancun People's Commune in Guangling County mobilized all their forces to work hard overnight to rush to harvest all the mature naked oats. Commune members in the Baizhuang Management Area have hoeed all 1,240 mu of millet in the area again and diverted water for irrigation, striving to increase the yield by 11 jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th - After studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, cadres and commune members in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, have doubled their efforts and launched an increase production and economizing competition to "compete with the sky for time and with the land for grain," vigorously promoting the early maturity of luxuriant crops, guaranteeing that the grain yield per mu of major autumn crops will increase by 10% compared with the original plan. At present, the county has 50,000 people engaged in various late-stage field management tasks every day. Since the promulgation of the resolution, the county has artificially pollinated 140,000 mu of late corn, tipped 9,400 mu of soybeans, and removed bottom leaves from 92,000 mu of sorghum.

Zhaodong County encountered a drought this spring that had not occurred in 40 years. The people's communes vigorously organized drought resistance, carried out rush planting, replanting, and crop conversion. After the drought was relieved, due to the application of fertilizer, the crops grew lush and green, but the replanted and converted farmland generally emerged 30 to 40 days later, and many crops were luxuriant and late-maturing. Currently, the season for local early frost is only more than 20 days away. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, it is necessary to strengthen field management to promote early maturity of late seedlings.

The Party's call greatly encouraged cadres and the masses. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the Wuzhan People's Commune decided to increase grain production by 40 jin per mu to welcome the 10th anniversary of National Day. More than 9,000 people in the entire commune immediately took action, releasing autumn ridges, pulling large weeds, and removing bottom leaves, tipping soybeans, and applying more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to promote early maturity and full grains. In seven days, they completed the second plowing of 4,200 mu of sorghum and corn, and removed the second batch of large weeds from 22,000 mu of other crops out of 30,000 mu. The 1,400 male and female laborers in Changwu Commune implemented the practice of "one team of people with two sets of tasks," accumulating all fertilizer in the fields in the early morning and evening when there was dew, and carrying out field management from morning to afternoon. The progress of releasing ridges every day increased from 390 mu to 3,800 mu. In order to ensure the realization of the production increase and economizing plan, all communes in the county have launched red flag competitions, competing to see who can take care of the luxuriant crops well and who can increase more grain production. In the Fuxing Management Area of the Songzhan Commune, after the oath-taking meeting of the entire commune on August 17, the number of people participating in field management to promote early crop maturity increased from the original 20-odd people to 170 people.

    党的号召鼓舞着农民超产信心
    浙江赢得夺取秋季大丰收第一回合胜利
    晋北专区各公社保证粮食产量超过原订指标二成
    黑龙江肇东县大秋作物每亩要比原计划增产一成
    新华社杭州6日电　浙江省千万农村干部和公社社员，响应党中央的战斗号召，开展了以晚稻超早稻、后熟超前熟为中心的增产节约运动。经过将近一个月的奋战，已经赢得了夺取秋季农业大丰收第一回合的胜利。到8月底止，全省近一千一百万亩单季、间作和连作晚稻中，大部分都施上两次追肥，少数施了三次，大部分耘了两次田，部分耘了三到四次。经过几次全面突击防治，晚秋作物的病虫害已大大减轻。前几天浙江省普遍下雨，一度受旱的一百五十七万亩农作物，旱象已大部解除。全省二百一十五万亩秋番薯、秋玉米等杂粮，也都进行了施肥、削草、培土等工作。许多地方的社员都说：今秋田间管理的特点是又早又勤又好。
    目前，浙江省秋季作物一片葱绿，生长情况良好。晚稻发棵早，分蘖多，一类苗一般在四十万苗以上，二类苗有三十万到三十五万苗，三类苗也在二十五万苗以上。单季晚稻已经抽头，连作晚稻已圆秆拔节。夏番薯一般已有一斤左右。全省一百八十万亩棉花株高档紧，结实累累，温州地区的伏桃已开始收摘，即将进入旺收。六十万亩络麻株秆高而粗壮，不久即将收剥。这是浙江省今年农业战线上继春花、早稻大丰收后的又一巨大胜利。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议的公布，给浙江人民带来了极大的鼓舞和力量。广大农村干部和群众决心再接再厉，挥戈大战9月，把大跃进的果子摘下来。嘉兴专区一百二十四个公社先后召开群众大会，提出了超包产、超规划的奋斗目标，力争晚稻产量达到七百至一千斤。四天来全专区出勤人数从原来每天一百三十七万多人递增到一百四十二万多人，共积了各种优质肥料一千六百三十二万担，并已迅速施到五十三万五千多亩连作晚稻田里。金华专区抓紧积肥和晚秋杂粮作物培育，有一半以上已培育三次，大部分已培育两次。温州专区东南部的平阳、瑞安、泰顺等县最近因强台风在福建省登陆，风雨较大，广大群众全力投入排涝和洗苗。温州地委要求各地抓紧耘田、施肥和治虫，要求晚稻在耘田、施肥三次的基础上再耘田、施肥一次，力争实现晚秋作物丰收。
    新华社太原6日电　党的八届八中全会公报和决议激励着山西省晋北专区的四百万人民。连日来，各公社、管理区、生产队纷纷举行集会、分析当前有利局势，修订增产计划，力争更多地超产来响应党的号召。全专区出现了出勤率、生产效率和质量普遍提高的新局面。如阳高县各人民公社男女社员的出勤率现在已达到95％以上，劳动效率和工作质量也有显著的提高，秋田管理工作做得又快又好。
    今年晋北专区各人民公社战胜了旱、涝、病、虫等各种自然灾害，粮食和各种经济作物普遍生长良好。党的号召更加鼓舞了广大干部和社员超产的信心。他们修订了增产指标，决心保证今年全区粮食产量比原订的包产指标超过二成甚至更多一些。目前，全区人民正以更大的干劲，投入了加强后期田间管理为中心的超包产竞赛运动。忻定县各人民公社有三十三万亩玉米、谷子、高粱等作物即将成熟，社员们抓紧最近时机又普遍锄了一次，其中有十一万多亩还施了追肥。静乐县太阳升人民公社社员学习了八届八中全会的文件后，投入秋田管理的劳力由过去的两千七百五十多人，增到三千八百多人。他们在五天内连续奋战，锄苗一万九千五百亩，压绿肥三十四万一千担，抢种秋菜三百三十六亩，还给牲畜播种了五百亩饲草。广灵县南村人民公社南土岭等七个管理区的社员，在决议的鼓舞下，全部出动苦战一夜把成熟的莜麦全部抢收登场。白庄管理区的社员已把全区一千二百四十亩谷子又锄了一遍并引水进行灌溉，力争每亩多增产十一斤。
    新华社哈尔滨6日电　黑龙江省肇东县公社干部和社员学习八届八中全会的公报和决议后，干劲倍增，展开了一场“与天争时，与地争粮”力促贪青庄稼早熟的增产节约竞赛，保证大秋作物每亩粮食产量比原计划增产10％。目前全县每天有五万人进行各项田间后期管理，从决议公布后，全县已经有十四万亩晚玉米进行了人工授粉，九千四百亩大豆掐了尖，九万二千多亩高粱打了底叶。
    肇东县今年春天遇到了四十年来未有过的大旱。人民公社大力组织抗旱，进行抢种、补种、改种。旱象解除后，由于加施了肥料，庄稼长的青葱碧绿，但是补种、改种的农田一般晚出苗三十天到四十天，不少庄稼贪青晚熟。而目前距离当地早霜到来的季节只有二十多天。为了保证丰收，必须加强田间管理，促使晚苗早熟。
    党的号召大大鼓舞了干部和群众，五站人民公社学习八中全会的文件后，决定每亩再增产四十斤粮食，迎接国庆十周年。全社九千多人立即行动起来，放秋垅、拔大草、打底叶，进行大豆掐尖，增施磷钾肥料，促使作物早熟和子粒饱满。七天的时间，就将四千二百亩高粱、玉米放完了二遍秋垅，三万亩其他作物中已有二万二千亩拔了第二遍大草。昌五公社一千四百名男女劳动力，实行了“一套人马两套活计”的做法，早晚田间有露水就全部积肥，上午到下午进行田间管理。每天放垅的进度由三百九十亩增加到三千八百亩。为了保证增产节约计划实现，全县各公社都展开了红旗竞赛，比赛谁能把贪青的庄稼侍弄的好，比赛谁能增产更多的粮食。宋站公社复兴管理区，在8月17日全公社竞赛誓师大会以后，参加田间管理促使庄稼早熟的人由原来的二十几个，增加到一百七十人。
