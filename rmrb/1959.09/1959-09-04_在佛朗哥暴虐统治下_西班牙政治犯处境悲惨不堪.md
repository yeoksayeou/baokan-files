Xinhua News Agency, London, September 2nd: A "Times" correspondent reports that the situation of over four hundred Spanish political prisoners imprisoned near Burgos by the Franco regime is extremely miserable.

    The reporter writes that the mass petition submitted to the prison warden by political prisoners in June of this year demonstrates the difficult situation of Spanish political prisoners. The political prisoners demanded that they be supplied with books and magazines, necessary clothing, proper medical facilities, improved sanitation, and permission to file written complaints against the authorities' "illegal atrocities." The reporter said that the Spanish authorities have brutally persecuted the political prisoners who drafted the petition. Prison authorities placed the drafters of the petition in solitary confinement and extended the sentences of the political prisoners who signed the petition.

    在佛朗哥暴虐统治下
    西班牙政治犯处境悲惨不堪
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社伦敦消息：“泰晤士报”特派记者报道，被佛朗哥政权囚禁在布尔哥斯附近监狱中的四百余名西班牙政治犯，处境悲惨不堪。
    记者写道，今年6月大批政治犯向监狱长请愿一事表明了西班牙政治犯的艰难处境。政治犯们要求供给他们书籍杂志、必要的衣服、应有的医疗设施，改善卫生条件，允许他们对当局的“非法暴行”提出书面控诉。记者说，西班牙当局对起草这一请愿书的政治犯进行了残酷的迫害。监狱当局把请愿书的草起人关进单身牢房，并延长了在请愿书上签名的政治犯们的服刑期限。
