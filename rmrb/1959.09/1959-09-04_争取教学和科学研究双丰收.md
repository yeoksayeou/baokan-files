    Strive for a Double Harvest in Teaching and Scientific Research
    Yang Shixian, President of Nankai University
    The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee have inspired every one of us engaged in teaching and scientific research. We resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, go all out, overcome all difficulties, and strive to achieve a double harvest in teaching and scientific research.
    This semester, Nankai University has enrolled more than 1,000 new students and added four new majors. The task of cultivating talents is more arduous than in the past few years. At the same time, in terms of scientific research, we are also undertaking relevant research projects on pesticides such as insecticides and ion exchangers, and we are required to reach a higher level within five or six years. The scope of research cooperation with the Soviet Union has also been greatly expanded. Under the current circumstances where the number of teaching and research personnel cannot meet the needs, it is difficult to complete these tasks. However, after reading the Party's resolution, we have a clearer understanding of the current favorable situation. Under the leadership of the Party, we must rely on the masses to complete our teaching and scientific research tasks.

    争取教学和科学研究双丰收
    南开大学校长　杨石先
    党的八中全会的公报和决议鼓舞了我们每一个教学和科学研究工作者。我们坚决响应党中央的号召，鼓足干劲，克服一切困难，争取在教学和科学研究方面实现双丰收。
    这学期，南开大学招收了一千多名新生，增加了四个新的专业，培养人材的任务比过去几年都要繁重。同时，在科学研究方面，我们还担负了农药方面的杀虫剂、离子交换剂等有关研究项目，并且要求在五、六年内达到更高水平；和苏联合作的研究工作的范围也大为扩大。在目前教学和研究人员不能满足需要的情况下，完成这些任务是有困难的。但是，当我们读了党的决议以后，更加认清了当前的有利形势。我们要在党的领导下，依靠群众，完成我们的教学和科学研究任务。
