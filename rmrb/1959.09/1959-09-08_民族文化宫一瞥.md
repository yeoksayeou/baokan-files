A Glimpse of the Cultural Palace of Nationalities
By Our Reporter Zhou Dingfang

The Cultural Palace of Nationalities has been built in the capital. The soaring tower-style architecture, the peacock-blue glazed tile roof, combined with the white-tiled exterior walls, make its height and color particularly striking among the surrounding buildings.

The total area of this building is 30,700 square meters, consisting of six parts: a museum, a library, an auditorium, a dance hall, a restaurant, and a guest house.

Stepping onto the granite steps and passing through the portico decorated with white marble, you are greeted by the central hall. This hall is four stories high, and its floor and walls are decorated with green and white marble. The most eye-catching decoration is the four white marble bas-reliefs embedded in the walls. Each relief is 6.27 meters high and 2.56 meters wide, with fourteen to twenty-one figures in each, each person symbolizing a nationality. These figures are all life-size, and their postures and facial expressions are all different. One of the reliefs, on the southwest side, depicts the arrival of spring on the earth, with people of various nationalities in the southwest seizing the opportunity to work hard in production. From the picture, in the distance are boundless wheat fields and many factories, hydroelectric power stations, and other buildings, and in the foreground, people of all nationalities are working enthusiastically. A relief on the southeast side uses coconut trees by the coast to set off the summer season. In the picture, people are joyfully holding rice, raising big fish, and holding fruits, a scene of celebrating the harvest. A relief on the northwest side shows a flock of sheep in the distance, and in the foreground, the joyful scene of people of all nationalities harvesting wheat, picking cotton, and picking grapes. The relief on the northeast side shows a group of people surrounding an industrial product tied with colored silk, reporting good news to the people of the motherland, reflecting the great achievements made by the people of all nationalities in the northeast region in industrial production. These reliefs were created collectively by teachers and students of the Sculpture Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts after experiencing life in ethnic minority areas, and were completed after two months of meticulous carving by sculpture workers.

To the north of the central hall is an exhibition hall of the museum. On a white marble slab at the entrance is engraved in gold the fourteen characters written by Chairman Mao: "Unite, all nationalities of the People's Republic of China." The interior walls, floor, and pillars of this hall are light green and beige, with simple patterns sculpted on the capitals of the pillars, and the decoration is simple. The ceiling of the hall is designed in the form of two low sides and a high center, which makes it look spacious and bright. This design technique is suitable for exhibition venues, as it allows the audience to concentrate all their attention on viewing the exhibits. A large screen at the entrance of the exhibition hall hangs a long, heavy-colored silk painting of the great unity of all nationalities in the country. In the picture, Chairman Mao stands in the center, surrounded by people of fifty-two nationalities playing various national musical instruments, wearing festive national costumes, singing and dancing, showing the scene of people of all nationalities in the motherland's big family, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, equally united, full of vigor, and jointly building socialism. Behind the screen is a national tower. The upper part of the tower is written with the eight characters "Unity, Unification, Development, Prosperity." The ground floor of the exhibition hall is a library that can store 600,000 books. This is a library specializing in nationalities, with two large reading rooms and two research rooms. The library's stacks are made of black and white sheet metal shelves and reinforced concrete pillars. Compared with the previous steel structure stacks, it can save a lot of steel and has no impact on the collection of books. This is a reform in technological innovation by the Beijing Design Institute. The east and west sides of the first and second floors of the central hall are four symmetrical exhibition halls. The walls, pillars, and floors of the exhibition halls are all beige and light yellow. The decoration and colors in the hall are simple and generous. Entering the gate, at the entrance of an exhibition hall on the west side of the second floor, you can see a famous Uighur folk song written on a vertical scroll: "If all the trees in the world were turned into pens, if all the rivers in the world were turned into ink, if all the land in the world were turned into paper, even then you could not write enough about Chairman Mao's kindness." Soon, the "Ten Years of National Work Exhibition" will be held in these exhibition halls, introducing the achievements of the people of all nationalities in socialist construction, as well as their history and living conditions.

Coming out of the exhibition hall on the east side and turning south, we come to the east wing of the Cultural Palace of Nationalities. This is an auditorium that can accommodate 1,150 spectators. The ceiling of the auditorium is a sunflower lamp decorated with colorful glass. The seats in the auditorium are stepped, with a distance of twelve centimeters between each row, which is very spacious. The auditorium will be equipped with an ultra-short wave "interpretation wind" that can translate eight languages. This is the latest product made in our country. Its receiver is very delicate, the size of two cigarette cases, and can be placed in your pocket to listen anywhere in the hall. The stage in the auditorium has a large area and is fully equipped, with forty-two electric hoists and a new-style lighting console, which can freely operate the brightness of the lights. It is suitable for performing large-scale operas and dance dramas. The auditorium is also equipped with television and live broadcast equipment.

The west wing of the Cultural Palace of Nationalities is the entertainment hall, dance hall and restaurant. The entertainment hall is located in the basement below the dance hall. Architects have made full use of the building area based on the principles of applicability, economy, and attention to aesthetics where possible. They slightly raised the windows of the basement to make the indoor light suitable for various entertainment activities. Here, there will be a small-bore rifle shooting range, a small gymnasium for basketball shooting practice and various skill activities, and more than ten entertainment and sports rooms for table tennis, globe, billiards, drama, dance, national musical instruments, etc.

The dance hall is built on the second floor of the west wing. The light green walls, the water-red ceiling, and the milky-white pillars create a very soft tone. The dance floor is oval, with a circle of dim lights above it. Behind the dance floor is a screen of "A Hundred Birds Facing the Phoenix," behind which is an elegant tea seat. Above the dance hall are the halal restaurant and the Chinese restaurant. The portico is decorated with a mural of sika deer in a pine and cypress forest. The ceiling of the restaurant is sky blue and can accommodate more than 400 people at the same time. Going up from the restaurant, there is an open-air roof with an open-air dance floor in the middle that can accommodate 200 people dancing, surrounded by white railings. After visiting the exhibits or engaging in entertainment activities, people can rest here by leaning on the railings.

Visiting upwards along the central part of the building, the third floor is the guest house of the Cultural Palace of Nationalities, with twenty guest rooms. The fourth to tenth floors are the thirty-five exhibition rooms of the museum, and the two floors above are the lookout hall. The exhibition rooms and the lookout hall are octagonal. The thirteenth floor is the top of the tower. The lookout hall is ten meters high and is surrounded by floor-to-ceiling glass windows, with a balcony outside the windows. Leaning on the railings of the balcony, you can have a bird's-eye view of the entire city of Beijing. Looking around, the newly built high-rise buildings and the ancient buildings with red walls and yellow tiles are in harmony with each other. Looking down, the cars seem like large toy cars, shuttling back and forth on the streets. It is already more than fifty meters above the ground.

    民族文化宫一瞥
    本报记者　周定舫
    民族文化宫在首都建成了。高耸的塔式建筑，孔雀蓝的琉璃瓦顶，配上白色面砖的外墙，使它的高度和色彩在周围的建筑物中显得分外鲜明。
    这座建筑物的总面积达三万零七百平方米，由博物馆、图书馆、礼堂、舞厅、餐厅和招待所六部分组成。
    踏上花岗石台阶，穿过用汉白玉装饰成的门廊，迎面就是中央大厅。这个厅有四层楼高，它的地面和墙壁，都是用绿色和白色大理石装成的。装饰中最引人注目的是镶嵌在墙壁上的四块汉白玉大浮雕。每幅浮雕高六点二七米，宽二点五六米，里面各有十四个到二十一个人物，每个人象征一个民族。这些人物都和真人一样大小，他们的姿态和面部表情都各不相同。西南面的一幅浮雕，描写春天来到大地，西南各民族人民抓紧时机，正在努力生产。从画面上看，远处是一望无边的麦田和许多工厂、水力发电站等建筑，近处是各族人民正在热情地劳动。东南面一幅浮雕，用海岸边的椰子树衬托出正是夏天的季节。画面上，人们喜气洋洋地，有的拿着水稻，有的举着大鱼，有的捧着水果，是一片欢庆丰收的景象。西北面的一幅浮雕，远处是一片羊群，近处是各族人民收割小麦、摘收棉花和葡萄的欢乐场面。东北面的浮雕画面，是一群人簇拥着一个用彩绸扎着的工业品，向祖国人民报喜，它反映着东北地区各族人民在工业生产上取得了巨大的成就。这些浮雕是中央美术学院雕塑系师生到少数民族地区体验生活后集体创作的，经过雕塑工人两个月的精雕细刻才完成。
    中央大厅北面是博物馆的一个展览厅。在大门入口的一块白色大理石上，雕刻着毛主席写的“中华人民共和国各民族团结起来”十四个金字。这个厅的内墙、地面和柱子，都是浅绿色和米黄色，柱头上塑造着简单的花纹，装饰朴素。厅的顶棚设计成两面低当中高的形式，显得宽敞而明朗。这种设计手法，适用于展览场所，它能使观众集中全部注意力参观展品。展览厅大门入口处的一个大屏风上，挂着全国各民族大团结的长幅重彩绢画。画面上，毛主席站在中央，周围是五十二个民族的人民弹着各种不同的民族乐器，穿着节日的本民族盛装，载歌载舞，表现出各族人民在祖国大家庭里，在党和毛主席领导下，平等团结、意气风发、共同建设社会主义的景象。屏风的背后，是一座民族塔。塔的上部写着“团结、统一、发展、繁荣”八个字。展览厅的底层，是一座能藏书六十万册的图书馆。这是一个民族专业性的图书馆，馆内设有两个大阅览室和两个研究室。图书馆的书库，是用黑白铁皮做的书架，钢筋混凝土做的柱子，和以往的钢结构书库比较，能节省大量钢材，对藏书没有影响。这是北京市设计院在技术革新中的改革。中央大厅东、西两面的一、二层，是对称着的四个展览厅。展览厅
  内的墙壁、柱子和地面，都是米色和米黄色的。厅内的装饰和色彩朴素大方。走进大门，在二层西边的一个展览厅的入口处，就能看到一首立轴上写着著名的维吾尔族的民歌：“把天下的树都变成笔，把天下的河水都变成墨，把天下的土地都变成纸，也写不完毛主席的恩情。”不久，在这些展览厅里将举行“十年来民族工作展览”，分别介绍各民族人民在社会主义建设中的成就，以及他们的历史和生活情况。
    从东面的展览厅出来，往南一拐，我们来到民族文化宫的东翼。这是一座可以容纳一千一百五十个观众的礼堂。礼堂顶棚是一盏用五彩玻璃装饰成的向日葵灯。礼堂的座位是阶梯式的，每排的座位相隔十二厘米，布置得很宽敞。礼堂里将安装着能翻译八种语言的超短波“译意风”。这是我国自制的最新产品。它的接收机十分精巧，和两只香烟盒一样大小，能够把它放在口袋里在厅内各处收听。礼堂内的舞台面积大、设备齐全，装置有四十二道电动吊杆和新式的灯光操作台，可以自由操作灯光的明暗。适合演出大型歌剧和舞剧。礼堂里还装有电视和实况转播等设备。
    民族文化宫的西翼，是文娱馆舞厅和餐厅。文娱馆设在舞厅下面的地下室里。建筑师根据适用、经济和在可能条件下注意美观的原则，充分利用了建筑面积，他们把地下室的窗户稍许加高，使室内的光线适合进行各种文娱活动。这里，将布置有小口径步枪的射击室，能作篮球投篮练习和各种技巧活动的小型健身房，其他还有乒乓球、地球、台球、戏剧、舞蹈、民族乐器等十多间文娱体育用房。
    舞厅建在西翼的二层。浅绿色的墙壁，水红色的顶棚，配上乳白色的柱子，色调很柔和。舞池是椭圆形的，上面装有一圈暗灯。舞池后部有一块百鸟朝凤的屏风，后面是一所雅致的茶座。舞厅上面是清真餐厅和中餐厅。门廊上装饰着一幅梅花鹿在松柏丛中的壁画。餐厅顶棚的颜色是天蓝的，能同时容纳四百多人进餐。从餐厅再往上走，是露天屋顶，中间有一个能容两百人跳舞的露天舞池，周围是白色栏杆。人们参观展品或进行文娱活动后，可以在这里倚栏休息。
    踏着中央部分的楼道往上参观，三层楼是民族文化宫的招待所，有二十套客房。四层到十层是博物馆的三十五个陈列室，再往上两层，是了望厅。陈列室和了望厅都是八角形的。十三层是塔顶。了望厅高十米，四周都是落地玻璃窗，窗外是阳台。倚在阳台的栏杆上，可以鸟瞰北京全城景色。环顾左右，新建的高层楼房和红墙黄瓦的古代建筑交相辉映。俯瞰下界，小汽车好像大的玩具汽车一样，在街道上穿梭般地往来。这里离地面已经五十多米了。
