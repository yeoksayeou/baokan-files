    "The Great Leap Forward" Accords Perfectly with the Hearts of Diligent People
    Hebei Jiahe, Xu Jiacheng
    "Farmers like the Great Leap Forward and fear slackening."
    We farmers are eagerly looking forward to producing more grain. The Party leads us in every possible way to achieve a Great Leap Forward in production. This is like twisting two ropes together, one heart, one energy. As a common saying goes, "The one who tends the fire is not afraid of dry firewood." We are like tending the fire. The Party provides us with dry firewood and guides us on how to burn it "more, faster, better, and more economically." Why wouldn't we be happy?
    Right-leaning opportunists pretend to say that farmers don't like the Great Leap Forward. This is simply spreading rumors and creating trouble. Only those "lazybones" will listen to them and are unwilling to work harder! Only those bad guys are afraid of the rapid pace of socialist construction!
    I dare to say: Whoever says that the "Great Leap Forward" is impossible is not a working person. Working people have a saying: "Work hard, eat slowly." Eating slowly and chewing carefully is easy to digest. Work must be "tight," "don't let the work bully people," have great ambitions, "people bully the work." Finish a day's work in half a day, finish two days' work in one day. Working people all know: "Tight work and slack work make a difference in the result." A person hoeing two mu of land is a day's work, hoeing five mu of land is also a day's work. Working more benefits the crops, and it is beneficial without harm. "Lazy people don't live longer than diligent people," and diligent people feel pain in laziness and idleness.
    The Great Leap Forward, striving for happiness without shying away from hard work, this is the true color of the working people. Only the Communist Party and Chairman Mao understand our hearts best!

    “大跃进”正顺勤劳人的心
    河北交河　徐家常
    “农民喜欢跃进，害怕松劲”。
    咱们农民急切的盼着多打粮食，党领导咱们千方百计的生产大跃进，这是两根绳子往一下拧，一条心，一股劲，有句俗话：“烧火的不怕柴禾干”。咱们好像在烧火，党供给我们干柴，指导我们如何“多快好省”地烧，咋不乐。
    右倾机会主义分子装模作样，说农民不喜欢大跃进，简直是造谣生事。只有那些“懒蛋”才听信他们的话，才不愿意多干活呢！只有那些坏家伙才怕社会主义建设的快呢！
    我敢说：谁说不能“大跃进”谁就不是劳动人，劳动人有句俗话：“紧干活，慢吃饭。”吃饭细嚼慢咽，容易消化。干活要“紧”，“不叫活欺着人”，有雄心大志，“人欺着活”。一天的活，半天干完，两天的活，一天干完。劳动人都知道：“干活一紧一松差成活”。一个人锄二亩地是一天，锄五亩地也是一天，多干了活，庄稼长好了，有益无损，“懒汉不比勤人长寿”，勤劳人就觉着懒闲痛苦。
    大跃进，为了争取幸福不辞劳苦，这是劳动人民的本色，只有共产党、毛主席最了解我们的心！
