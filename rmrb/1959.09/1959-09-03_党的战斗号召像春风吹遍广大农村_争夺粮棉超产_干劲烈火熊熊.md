The Party's battle call has spread rapidly across the vast countryside like a spring breeze. People's communes everywhere have convened mass meetings, engaging in fervent discussions among the masses. Many communes have set both proactive and reliable overproduction targets, striving for excess production in autumn crops. Currently, the vast ranks of cadres and the masses are filled with high morale and spirited vigor, and a great upsurge in the effort to achieve grain and cotton overproduction is developing vigorously. Below are the situations of several communes. – Editor

	Anhui Guangwu Commune Guarantees 10% Overproduction
		Production Progress Increases More Than Doubly
	Hefei, September 2nd (This Newspaper) – The members of Guangwu People's Commune in Jieshou County, Anhui Province, displayed even greater enthusiasm and generally more than doubled their progress in various productions on the first day after studying the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The entire commune re-ignited a mass movement to strive to overfulfill this year's various production targets.
	Since its establishment nearly a year ago, Guangwu Commune has achieved leap-forward development in various productions. In grain production, the average per-mu yield of more than 100,000 mu of wheat in the first half of the year increased by 81% compared to 1958; the average per-mu yield of more than 20,000 mu of early autumn crops such as sorghum and millet increased by 46% compared to 1958. In industry, the total value of industrial production in the first half of the year reached 4.34 million yuan, a fourfold increase compared to the same period in 1958. In diversified economic activities, the entire commune raised 23,000 pigs, averaging 1.2 pigs per household, a doubling compared to the same period in 1958; it also raised 5 million fish.
	The call of the Party Central Committee has boosted the greater enthusiasm of all cadres and members of Guangwu Commune, powerfully promoting the current movement of combating drought, protecting seedlings, and field management. In the day and night following the release of the Eighth Plenary Session communique, the entire commune newly dug more than 2,400 wells and irrigated 18,000 mu of land, more than doubling the previous daily progress. In terms of grain procurement, in one day, in addition to completing the commune's 1.8 million jin of public grain tasks, it also sold 1.5 million jin of surplus grain. In terms of commune-run industry, more than 20 farm tool factories and 194 local fertilizer plants rushed to produce 176 various water-lifting tools and more than 10,000 dan of local fertilizer in one day and night, more than doubling the previous daily progress. Currently, the mid- and late-autumn crops in the entire commune are generally growing vigorously, with more than 3,200 mu of early-maturing rice varieties already harvested, averaging 1,232 jin per mu, an increase of more than 100% compared to last year. The broad masses of cadres and the masses confidently guarantee a 10% increase in production on the basis of completing this year's grain production targets.
	Guangdong Shitan Commune Engages in Large-Scale Production for Self-Salvation
		Autumn Harvest Must Recoup the Year's Grain
	Guangzhou, September 2nd (This Newspaper) – The battle call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has greatly encouraged all members of Shitan Commune, a severely disaster-stricken commune in Zengcheng County, Guangdong Province, to restore production and rebuild their homes.
	On August 27th and 28th, Party organizations at all levels in Shitan Commune convened emergency cadre meetings and telephone conferences to convey the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session communique and resolutions at each level, deciding to ensure that the autumn harvest this year recoups the year's grain and accelerates the speed of rebuilding homes. This new decision quickly transformed into the actions of all commune members, with far more people attending work than usual. During the busiest period of agricultural work in the previous stage, the number of people attending work in the entire commune was about 17,000, but on the 27th and 28th, it exceeded 20,000. During the day, under the scorching sun, commune members sweated profusely, carrying out the inter-tilling, top-dressing, pest control, fertilizer accumulation, and miscellaneous grain planting of rice paddies. At night, many commune members gathered on the foundations of houses that had been washed away by floods more than two months ago, clearing away tile debris, transporting mud from the walls, and preparing to free up the foundations to build new houses as soon as possible. On the 27th alone, the entire commune cultivated more than 30,000 mu of fields, replenished seedlings on 25,000 mu of fields, and accumulated more than 150,000 dan of old wall mud.
	From the commune to the production brigades and production teams, discussions have been held in recent days on how to add additional measures to increase production this year, while organizing actions. In light of the current vigorous growth of seedlings and other favorable conditions, the commune is determined to make another effort to ensure a per-mu yield of 600 jin for 100,000 mu of late rice. In this way, the total output will slightly exceed the total output of the early and late rice crops last year, achieving the goal of "one crop equaling two crops." Based on this, each brigade immediately increased measures to effectively change the growth of 30,000 mu of third-class rice. In addition, preparations are being made to plant more than 3,000 mu of miscellaneous grains. According to the original plan, an average of 100 dan of refined fertilizer was applied per mu, but this has now been increased to an average of 150 dan of refined fertilizer per mu, and an extra 200 dan of old wall mud is applied to backward fields. Originally, it was planned to rebuild the more than 7,000 residential houses destroyed in the flood before the Spring Festival, but now, by adopting the multi-fast-good-saving method of "each team firing bricks and tiles, each household producing craftsmen," most of these houses will be completed within a little over a month.
	Henan Taqiao Commune Launches Overproduction Competition
		Increased Production Targets Raised by About 30%
	Zhengzhou, September 2nd (This Newspaper) – The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have inspired the members of Taqiao People's Commune in Shangcai County, Henan Province. More than 28,000 members of the entire commune held a mass meeting on August 27th, immediately launching a vigorous overproduction movement in response to the Party's battle call.
	In accordance with the spirit of the Party Central Committee's communique and resolutions, each brigade in the entire commune simultaneously analyzed favorable conditions and revised its original production increase plans. The plans revised by all 29 brigades and 196 production teams in the commune were all increased by about 30% compared to the original plans. The planned unit area yield of food crops was increased by an average of 100 jin after the revision; although cotton and sesame are close to maturity, as long as water and fertilizer are added and specific management measures are taken, production can also be increased by 10% to 20%.
	In order to achieve the new production increase targets, teams versus teams, groups versus groups, and individuals versus individuals in the entire commune immediately launched an overproduction competition movement to strive to achieve the new targets. The formerly backward Hei Zhai Brigade in combating drought used to deploy only 70 waterwheels, but now it has suddenly increased to more than 110, and the daily irrigation progress has increased from 300 mu to 600 mu. The 6,300 mu of drought-affected land was basically irrigated by August 29th. The Third Production Team of Hou Zhang Brigade held a meeting on August 27th, mobilizing 96 people and ten waterwheels overnight, irrigating more than 30 mu of beans in just half a night. The entire production team's 320 mu of beans was basically irrigated by the 30th. After the Meng Zhuang Brigade revised its planned targets, the number of labor attendance increased from 625 to 655, and many auxiliary laborers also automatically participated in the drought resistance effort.
	Hubei Pengxing Commune Sets Overproduction Targets
		Increasing Grain Production by 12 Million Jin
	Wuhan, September 2nd (This Newspaper) – Pengxing People's Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, has decided to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee with practical actions to strive for an actual increase of 12 million jin in grain production compared to the original total grain production target.
	The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, like a spring breeze, swept through every village in Pengxing Commune, encouraging the people who were wheeling water to resist drought by the river and canal. Guan Musheng, the branch secretary of Changfeng Production Team and a national agricultural labor model, convened a meeting of cadres above the rank of small team leader and representatives of some commune members on the evening of August 27th to discuss specific measures to increase production and conserve. Under the threat of nearly two months of continuous drought, this production team originally planned to revise the total grain production plan from 2.37 million jin to 2.17 million jin. Now, after discussion, everyone analyzed the conditions and unanimously stated that they would not only ensure the realization of the original plan, but also strive to overproduce 36,000 jin.
	In the past two days, all 85 production teams in the commune, like Changfeng Production Team, have held meetings to discuss how to respond to the call of the Central Committee. The cadres and members of the May Fourth Production Team guaranteed that not a single acre of the 600 mu of late rice would die from drought. On August 28th, the entire team increased the number of people by 50 and the number of waterwheels by six to wheel water to the Huan River. The drought situation was most severe in the Fifth and Tenth small teams of the Jin Xing Production Team, with nearly 100 mu of drought-affected late rice. After studying the Central Committee's resolutions, the two small teams increased the number of waterwheels by 23 and the number of people by more than 90 to wheel water to the big canal the next day, irrigating all the drought-affected late rice fields in two days.
	According to the over-planned targets revised by each production team, the entire commune, even in the face of two months of continuous drought, will still strive to increase the total grain production by 12 million jin compared to the originally planned 82 million jin.
	Yunnan Honghe Commune Strengthens Field Management
		Striving for Great Overproduction of Late Rice and Sugarcane
	Kunming, September 2nd (This Newspaper) – More than 10,000 Dai commune members of Honghe People's Commune in Yuanjiang County, Yunnan Province, on the basis of winning a 40% increase in early rice production this year, are making great efforts in late rice field management and the late-stage processing of sugarcane, determined to respond to the Party's battle call with practical actions to overfulfill this year's production plan.
	The early rice in Honghe People's Commune has been harvested, with an average net yield of more than 700 jin per mu, an increase of 40% compared to last year. The late rice is growing green and strong; the more than 6,800 mu of sugarcane, after overcoming the severe threat of drought, is growing well.
	On August 27th, more than 11,000 Dai farmers in the entire commune put on festive costumes, beat elephant-foot drums, and gathered in the rain, warmly supporting the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. At the meeting, commune members put forward overproduction targets for late rice and sugarcane, striving to increase the per-mu yield of more than 12,000 mu of late rice in the entire commune from the originally contracted 500 jin to 700 jin; and to increase the more than 6,800 mu of sugarcane from the originally planned 18,000 jin per mu to 20,000 jin. Subsequently, cadres at all levels of the commune, together with the commune members, formulated specific measures one by one to ensure the realization of these targets.
	On the evening of the 27th, more than 10,000 Dai farmers immediately plunged into the field battle. More than 1,700 sugarcane professional teams were loosening the soil and banking up the roots in the sugarcane forest. Early in the morning of the 28th, as the morning mist still shrouded the mountainside, Dai commune members launched a production competition in the fields to compare attendance, enthusiasm, and quality, greatly improving work efficiency compared to the past. The Third Management Area, which had previously been slow in production progress, saw its daily progress in weeding increase by nearly 100% on this day compared to the 26th, while ensuring quality.

      广东石滩公社大搞生产自救
        秋收一造要夺回全年粮
    本报广州2日电　党的八届八中全会的战斗号召大大鼓舞了广东省增城县重灾公社——石滩公社全体社员恢复生产、重整家园的干劲。
    8月27日、28日这两天，石滩公社的各级党组织召开了干部紧急会议、电话会议，层层贯彻八中全会公报和决议的精神，决定保证今年秋收一造夺回全年粮，加快重建家园的速度。这一新的决定，很快就变成了全体社员的行动，出勤人数比往常多得多。前段农活最忙时，全公社出勤人数是一万七千名左右，27日和28日却超出了两万人。白天，在火热的阳光下，社员们挥汗进行水稻的中耕、追肥、除虫和积肥、种杂粮。入夜，许多社员又聚集在两个多月前被洪水冲塌的房基上，清除瓦渣，运走墙坭，准备尽快地腾出地基盖新房。仅27日一天，全公社便耘田三万多亩，有两万五千亩田补足了缺苗，积到的老墙坭十五万多担。
    从公社到生产大队和生产队，连日来都在一边讨论如何追加今年增产的措施，一边组织行动。公社针对眼前禾苗生势壮旺及其它有利条件，决心再加一把劲，确保十万亩晚稻亩产六百斤。这样，总产量将略超去年早晚两造产量的总和，达到“一造顶两造”的目标。各个大队据此立即增加措施，切实改变三万亩三类禾的生长情况。此外，还准备增种三千多亩杂粮。按照过去计划，平均每亩施精肥一百担，现在已提高到平均每亩施精肥一百五十担，对落后田还特别多施两百担老墙坭。原来打算春节前把水灾中塌掉的七千多间住宅重建起来，现在采取“队队烧砖瓦、户户出鲁班”的多快好省的办法后，将使这些房屋大部分在一个多月内建成。
      河南塔桥公社展开超产竞赛

        增产粮食一千二百万斤
    本报武汉2日电　湖北省孝感县朋兴人民公社决定以争取较原定粮食总产指标增加一千二百万斤的实际行动，来响应党中央的号召。
    党的八中全会公报和决议，像春风一样吹遍了朋兴公社的每个村庄，鼓舞了正在河边、渠旁车水抗旱的人们。长风生产队支部书记、全国农业劳动模范官木生在8月27日晚召集小队长以上干部和部分社员代表开会，讨论了增产节约的具体措施。在持续近两个月干旱的威胁下，这个生产队原来想把粮食总产规划从二百三十七万斤修改为二百一十七万斤。现在，经过讨论，大家分析了条件，一致表示不仅要保证实现原规划，还要力争超产三万六千斤。
    这两天，全社八十五个生产队都跟长风生产队一样，分别集会讨论如何响应中央的号召。五四生产队的干部和社员保证六百亩晚稻一块也不干死。8月28日，全队就增加五十多人、六部水车到环河边车水。金星生产队第五小队和第十小队旱象最严重，受旱的晚稻近一百亩。学习中央的决议后，第二天两小队就增加二十三部水车、九十多人到大渠里车水，两天时间就把全部受旱的晚稻田灌上一遍。
    根据各生产队修订的超规划指标，全公社即便在已经持续干旱两个月的情况下，还要力争粮食总产较原定八千二百万斤增加一千二百万斤。
      云南红河公社加强田间管理
        力争晚稻甘蔗大大超产
    本报昆明2日电　云南省元江县红河人民公社的上万傣族社员，在夺得今年早稻增产四成的基础上，大干晚稻田间管理和甘蔗的后期加工，决心以超额完成今年生产计划的实际行动，来响应党的战斗号召。
    红河人民公社的早稻已经收割完毕，平均每亩净收七百多斤，比去年增产四成，晚稻正长得绿油茁壮；六千八百多亩甘蔗，在战胜严重的干旱威胁后，生长良好。
    8月27日，全社一万一千多傣族农民，穿上节日盛装，敲打着象脚鼓，冒雨集会，热烈拥护党的八届八中全会的决议。社员们在会上纷纷提出晚稻和甘蔗的超产目标，力争全社一万二千多亩晚稻，亩产由原包产五百斤提高到七百斤；六千八百多亩甘蔗由原计划亩产一万八千斤，提高到二万斤。接着，公社各级干部又同社员们一起，一项一项地制订了保证实现这些指标的具体措施。
    27日晚上，上万的傣族农民，立即投入田间战斗。甘蔗专业队伍一千七百多人，在甘蔗林中提墒培土。28日一早，晨雾还笼罩在山腰，傣族社员们就在田间展开了比出勤、比干劲、比质量的生产竞赛，工效比往日大大提高。原来生产进度较迟缓的第三管理区，这一天的薅秧日进度比26日提高了近一倍，而且保证了质量。
