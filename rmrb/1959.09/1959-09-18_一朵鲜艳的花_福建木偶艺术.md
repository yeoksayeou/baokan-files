    A Bright and Colorful Flower – Fujian Puppet Art
    By our reporter Cai Qinghe
    Fujian puppet art is famous at home and abroad, possessing high skill and unique style. This strange, colorful, and exquisite art form, nurtured by the Party, has become a bright red flower in the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" garden of national art.
    Puppet shows have a long history in China. They are most prevalent and widely spread in Fujian and Guangdong, particularly in the southern part of Fujian, so people call Southern Fujian the "hometown of puppet art."
    Fujian's puppet theater genres include string puppets (also known as marionettes), glove puppets (also known as palm theater), iron wire puppets, and shadow puppets, among which string puppets and glove puppets are the most developed. Due to the different dialects and tunes in the regions where they are popular, string puppets are divided into Southern Fujian puppets and Western Fujian puppets, while glove puppets are divided into Northern and Southern schools. Each type and school has its own style and characteristics. Their performing arts and repertoire are quite complete. At the same time, puppet shows have a strong expressive power, a strong local flavor, and are often combined with local operas. Their language and movements are rhythmic, and they can express various complex emotions through various actions. Therefore, they have long been loved by the people and have been preserved and passed down through generations.
    Fujian puppet heads have a unique artistic style in terms of facial makeup. They are divided into three major categories: Quanzhou puppet heads, which adopt the facial makeup of Liyuan Opera; Shima puppet heads, which adopt the facial makeup of Peking Opera; and Zhangzhou puppet heads, which blend the facial makeup of Han Opera and Hakka Opera. The facial makeup of Quanzhou string puppet heads is similar to those seen in Tang Dynasty figure paintings. The faces of young men and women are full and plump, with dragon eyebrows, phoenix eyes, and high hairlines. The character modeling of other roles, such as Jing (painted face male) and Chou (clown), is also appropriately exaggerated. For example, the Chou roles are often "missing teeth," "red monkey," "squint-eyed," and "black kuan," making it immediately clear that they are "cunning," "foolish," "stupid," and "mischievous"... The late famous folk puppet sculptor Jiang Jia walked, in his more than seventy years of artistic practice, had created more than two hundred and eighty kinds of puppet head statues, which have won high praise at home and abroad. Now his art has been inherited by his son, Jiang Chao Xuan, and is developing in new directions. In addition to the head, the costumes and embroidery of the puppets are also very exquisite, and the colors are harmonious and gorgeous.
    As we all know, puppets have no consciousness. Only after being manipulated by the artists can they make vivid and colorful movements. Fujian puppet artists often manipulate the puppets' movements with remarkable realism. For example, Quanzhou string puppet shows can perform many actions such as drawing a sword, inserting a sword, waving a fan, wiping tears, stroking a beard, drinking wine, writing, kicking a ball, plowing, opening a door, and closing a door. Xie Zhenxiang, a famous artist from the Quanzhou Puppet Show Experimental Troupe, performs all the actions of the wet nurse in "Lu An Zhou" comforting Lu Deng's young son, Lu Wenlong, which is as intimate and lifelike as a real person taking care of their own baby. In particular, some actions (such as riding clouds, flying in an airplane, riding a horse, and rotating a boat) cannot be performed by human actors, but string puppet shows can perform them vividly. The main feature of Quanzhou puppet shows' ability to make such delicate and complex movements is that there are many strings. Generally, string puppets have only eight or nine strings, with a maximum of twelve, but Quanzhou string puppets have at least sixteen strings, with a maximum of twenty-four. If they are matched with animals (riding a horse), they need twenty-eight strings. When the Soviet puppet expert Obraztsov visited China in 1952, he was impressed by the unique performance style of the Quanzhou string puppet show. After returning to his country, he published his impressions in the "Spark" magazine, saying: "This kind of creation does not exist in any European country."
    Glove puppetry is a unique puppet theater genre in southern Fujian Province. Its performance art can be roughly divided into Northern and Southern schools. The five fingers of an excellent artist are the puppet's nervous system. They can delicately depict the various forms of the characters. For example, after a fierce battle, the puppet in a martial arts play faces the audience with an appearance of rapid breathing after the battle, making people forget that it is a puppet performing on the stage. Artists have such a high level of artistic performance skills because they have inherited excellent traditional performance art and constantly absorbed experience from real life. Chen Nantian, a famous glove puppet artist, in order to improve his performance skills, once caught a dragonfly to tease a tiger in a circus iron cage, carefully observing the tiger's movements; therefore, his performance of a tiger pouncing on a dragonfly is very realistic.
    However, the valuable puppet art heritage of Fujian, in the old society, especially during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, not only did not receive due attention and cultivation, but was instead subjected to trampling and persecution. The artists not only had no political status at all, but also lived a sad life of "not being able to eat enough, not being able to keep warm, and living near temples." Zheng Fulai, a famous old glove puppet artist, once performed a play called "Mr. Su Yi" in Shipu Village, Longxi County, before liberation. After watching the play, the local gentry believed that the plot exposed the dark secrets of the ruling class. Therefore, they held dissatisfaction in their hearts, secretly called a few hooligans with short guns, and, regardless of right or wrong, went on stage to forcibly snatch away the puppets, smashing his only "rice bowl." During this period, many artists were forced to become unemployed and change careers, and some even burned or sold the puppet scripts and puppet heads treasured at home as firewood. The excellent puppet art flower of the motherland was withering. By the time of liberation, there were only a few puppet troupes left. After liberation, with the strong support of the Party and the People's Government, Fujian puppet art gradually developed and grew. Artists were turned over in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. They no longer worried about unemployment or worried about three meals a day. They all had fixed monthly salaries and lived a life of peace and contentment, respected everywhere. Many artists have joined the Chinese Dramatists Association, and some have been elected as people's representatives to participate in the management of national affairs. Zheng Fulai and Yang Sheng, famous glove puppet artists, are currently members of the Fujian Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and Yang Sheng is also a national advanced producer.
    Under the illumination of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weed Through the Old to Bring Forth the New," Fujian puppet art has made significant achievements in inheriting tradition, exploring, recording, and sorting out excellent repertoires, reforming performance art, and cooperating with various central tasks to carry out socialist propaganda and education to the broad masses, or in cultivating new forces or tutoring amateur puppet art activities. Up to now, Fujian Province has organized nineteen professional puppet troupes, and amateur troupes and school puppet theater interest groups have also been widely organized in various places. In order to strengthen the ideological leadership and organizational construction of puppet art, the cultural administrative departments of Fujian Province, in addition to opening puppet theater training classes in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and other places, also organized puppet theater experimental troupes in Quanzhou and other places. While starting to explore, record, and sort out traditional repertoires, in order to cooperate with the propaganda and education of various political movements, the artists created many modern dramas, fables, and fairy tales, and went deep into the countryside, factories, coastal defense front lines, and schools to perform for workers, peasants, soldiers, and children, which played a positive role in promoting the central work. For example, in order to further use puppet art to carry out the struggle against the enemy, the Quanzhou Puppet Show Experimental Troupe, with the concerted efforts of the artists, created the satirical drama "The Last Days of Chiang Kai-shek," which sharply and profoundly exposed the ugliness of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and the American aggressors, and warmly praised the victory of the Chinese people, showing the confidence of the people of the whole country in liberating Taiwan. In recent years, Fujian puppet shows have participated in national opera tours several times, traveling all over the mountains and rivers of the motherland, and have been widely praised by literary and art circles and the broad masses of the audience. In 1956 and 1957, they went abroad twice and performed in the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, Hungary, as well as Yugoslavia, France, Switzerland and other countries, and won high praise and returned with honors.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the artists have carried out bold innovations in puppet art, and have made great improvements in puppet image creation, puppet face colors, stage art settings, and music. For example, in the past, puppet faces were not colored, and when performing under lights, the complexion appeared too white due to reflection, and it was difficult for distant audiences to see the puppet's facial image clearly. Now the puppet face colors are the same as the human drama makeup process, applying colors and drawing facial makeup according to the character's age and personality. The artists also carved puppet heads according to the puppet character's personality, making their eyes, noses, and mouths move, further expressing the exaggerated art of puppet shows, adding to the characteristics of puppet performances.

    一朵鲜艳的花——福建木偶艺术
    本报记者　蔡清河
    福建木偶艺术是国内外闻名的，它具有高度技巧与独特风格。这支奇异、多彩、小巧的艺术花朵，在党的培养下，已成为“百花齐放”的祖国艺术花圃中的一朵鲜艳的红花。
    木偶戏在我国已有悠久的历史。流传最早、最广的是福建、广东，而以福建南部一带为最盛，所以人们称闽南为“木偶艺术之乡”。
    福建的木偶剧种，有提线木偶（又称傀儡戏）、布袋戏（又称掌中班）、铁线戏和纸影戏等等，其中以提线木偶与布袋戏最为发达。由于流行地区的不同，语言、曲调各异，所以提线木偶又分为闽南木偶和闽西木偶两种；布袋戏又分为南北两派。各种各派都有自己的风格与特点。其表演艺术和剧目内容，都相当完整，同时由于木偶表现力强，具有浓厚的生活气息和鲜明的地方色彩，而且多与地方戏曲相结合，在语言动作上又具有节奏性，在表演上能够通过各种动作来表现人物的各种复杂感情，所以长久以来为广大人民所耆爱，始终保存在民间，世代绵延的流传下来。
    福建木偶头在脸谱选型方面有他独特的艺术风格，其中分有采用梨园戏脸谱的泉州木偶头，采用京剧脸谱的石码木偶头，和以揉合汉调和客家调脸谱的漳州木偶头等三大类。泉州提线木偶头的脸谱与唐代人物绘画中所见相似，青年男女的面型，是两头丰腴，龙眉凤眼，高发贴鬓；其他的行当如净、丑的人物性格造型，也能予以适当的夸张，如丑行方面的多是“缺嘴”、“红猴”、“斜目”、“黑阔”等等，使人一见便知它是“狡滑”、“傻瓜”、“愚笨”、“刁皮”……。已故的著名民间木偶雕刻家江加走，在他七十多年的艺术实践中，曾先后创造了二百八十多种木偶头塑像，在国内外获得很高的评价。现在他的艺术，已由他的儿子江朝铉继承下来，并向新的方向发展。木偶的制作除头部以外，木偶的服装刺绣也很精细，颜色的调配上也很和谐华丽。
    人们知道，木偶是没有知觉的，它经过艺人的操纵以后，才能做出有声有色的动作。福建木偶艺人常常把木偶的动作操纵得维妙维肖。如泉州提线木偶戏能表演拔剑、插剑、挥扇、拭泪、理髯、吃酒、写字、踢球、犁地、开门、关门等许多动作，泉州木偶戏实验剧团名艺人谢祯祥，表演“潞安州”中的乳母用手在抚慰陆登幼子陆文龙的一切动作，完全像活人在照顾自己婴儿那样的亲切逼真。特别是有些动作（如驾云、乘飞机、骑马、摇船旋转等）是人戏所办不到的，而提线木偶戏却表演的活灵活现。泉州木偶戏能够做出这样细致、复杂的动作，主要的特点是线条多，一般提线木偶只有八、九条，最多十二条，但泉州提线木偶最少就有十六条，最多有二十四条，如果配合动物（骑马）就要二十八条。苏联木偶专家奥布拉兹卓夫在1952年访问我国的时候，看到泉州提线木偶戏的演出，对其独特的表演风格表示钦佩，回国以后，曾在“星火”杂志上发表观感说：“这种创造是欧洲任何国家所没有的。”
    布袋戏是福建省南部特有的木偶剧种。它的演艺大体上可分做南北两派。一个优秀艺人的五个指头，就是木偶的神经系统。它能细腻地刻划脚色的诸般形态，例如武戏中的木偶，在激烈对仗以后，面向观众摆出一副战后呼吸急促的神态，使人忘了戏台上表演的是木偶。艺人有这么高度技巧的艺术表演水平，是他们在继承优秀的传统表演艺术和不断向现实生活吸取经验的结果。布袋戏名艺人陈南田为了提高自己的表演技术，曾捉了一只蜻蜓逗马戏团铁笼里的老虎，仔细观察老虎的动作；因此，他演猛虎扑蜻蜓非常逼真。
    但是，福建宝贵的木偶艺术遗产，在旧社会里，特别是在国民党反动统治时期，不仅没有得到应有的重视和培植，相反地却遭受了蹂躏和迫害，艺人们不仅在政治上丝毫谈不上有地位，而且长期过着“吃不饱，穿不暖，住庵边庙角”的悲痛生活。布袋戏名老艺人郑福来，解放前有一次在龙溪县诗浦村演一出名叫“苏义先生”时，当地豪绅看戏后，认为剧情揭露了统治阶级的黑暗内幕，因此心抱不满，暗中叫几个流氓带着短枪，不分皂白，上台将木偶强夺而去，捣碎了他的唯一的“饭碗”。在这个时期，许多艺人被迫失业、转业，有的甚至把家里珍藏的木偶剧本和木偶头当柴烧或卖掉，优秀的祖国木偶艺术花朵，日趋枯萎。到临解放时，仅剩的木偶戏班寥寥无几了。解放后，在党和人民政府的极力扶持下，福建木偶艺术才逐渐发展、壮大起来，艺人们在政治、经济、文化各方面都得到翻身。他们不再为失业担忧，为三餐顾虑，每月都有固定的工资收入，大家过着安居乐业的生活，处处受人尊敬。不少艺人参加了中国戏剧家协会，有的被选为人民代表，参加管理国家大事。布袋戏名艺人郑福来、杨胜，目前是福建省政治协商委员会委员，杨胜还是全国先进生产者。
    在毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的文艺方针照耀下，福建木偶艺术在继承传统，发掘、记录、整理优秀剧目和改革表演艺术，以及配合各个中心任务，向广大群众进行社会主义宣传教育，或者在培养新生力量或辅导业余木偶艺术活动等方面，都取得了重大成绩。到目前为止，福建省已组织了十九个专业木偶剧团，业余剧团和学校木偶戏剧兴趣小组也在各地广泛组织起来。福建省文化行政领导部门，为了加强木偶艺术的思想领导和组织建设工作，除了在厦门、漳州、泉州等地开设木偶戏剧训练班以外，并在泉州等地组织了木偶戏实验剧团，在着手发掘、记录和整理传统剧目的同时，艺人们为了配合各个政治运动的宣传教育，创作了许多现代剧、寓言剧和童话剧，深入农村、工厂、海防前线和学校为工农兵和小朋友巡回演出，对推动中心工作起了积极作用。如泉州木偶戏实验剧团为了进一步运用木偶艺术开展对敌斗争，在艺人们通力合作下创作了讽刺剧“蒋贼末日”，尖锐而深刻地揭露了蒋介石卖国集团和美国侵略者的丑态，热烈歌颂了中国人民的胜利，显示了全国人民解放台湾的信心。几年来福建木偶戏曾数次参加了全国戏曲大巡回表演，走遍了祖国山河，普遍受到各地文艺界和广大观众的赞扬。1956年和1957年曾二次出国先后在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、蒙古、匈牙利；以及南斯拉夫、法国、瑞士等国家上演，获得很高评价，满载荣誉而归。
    近年来，艺人们在党的领导下，对木偶艺术进行了大胆的革新，在木偶形象创作、木偶脸孔色彩和舞台美术布景、音乐等方面，都有很大改进。如过去木偶脸部不加色彩，在灯光下演出时，由于反射作用，脸色显得太白，远处观众不易看清木偶面部形象。现在木偶脸孔色彩都和人戏化装过程一样，根据人物的年龄和性格，着上颜色和描绘脸谱。艺人们还根据木偶人物性格，雕刻出的木偶头，使其眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴都会活动，进一步表现木偶戏的夸张艺术。增加了木偶演出的特色。
