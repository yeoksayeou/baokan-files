    New "Pillar of the Midstream"

    Locking the Evil Dragon

    In the twenty-third year of Daoguang, the great king showed his skills, washing away the Taiyang Ferry, taking along Wanjin Shoal, kicking the Sanmen Temple, and whipping the Shijia Shoal. – Yellow River Folk Song

    On the high water diversion wall,
    An old man, leaning on his cane,
    Passed through the crowd of water watchers,
    To appreciate the July flood peak.
    Glad to hear the roar of the raging torrent,
    Glad to see the waves splashing on his body,
    The old man walked back and forth on the wall,
    Happily waving the cane in his hand.
    He said that Renmen is a big lock,
    Tightly stuck on the Evil Dragon's neck;
    He also said that Renmen is a rein,
    Leading the Evil Dragon's nose towards the east.
    From now on, there is no fear of floods rising to the sky,
    From now on, there is no fear of the roar shaking people's hearts;
    With a dragon-taming hero,
    Even the fiercest beast will be tamed like a sheep.
    Come again to watch next autumn,
    The trapped Evil Dragon will surely spit out lightning,
    Transform into thousands of strings of bright pearls,
    To dedicate a new dress to the beautiful rivers and mountains.
    On the high water diversion wall,
    An old man waving his cane,
    Passed through the crowd of water watchers,
    Appreciating the July flood peak.
    New "Pillar of the Midstream" Beneath Sanmen, in the turbulent rapids, stands a stone peak, the "Pillar of the Midstream" praised since ancient times. It is said to symbolize the character of our nation. Now, the dam cuts across Sanmen, and people say: This is the new "Pillar of the Midstream"!

    We cast a new pillar,
    A steel dam stands in the middle of the stream!
    Stepping on the Qinling Mountains in the south, kicking the Taihang Mountains in the north,
    Majestically guarding above Sanmen.
    Looking down at the Kunlun Mountains in the clouds,
    The water of the Yellow River rushes underground,
    Like a powerful band,
    Sending joyful and bold tunes.
    Behind is the vast sea,
    The east wind blows the surging waves,
    Like a sea of people setting off cheers,
    Banners fluttering, drums beating.
    With the sea behind, overlooking Kunlun,
    Standing in the center of the ten thousand li Yellow River!
    The sun, moon, and stars revolve overhead,
    All rivers and mountains come to pay tribute.
    Reaching out to embrace a lake of emerald water,
    Like raising a cup of happiness;
    Casually throwing out strings of lights,
    That dragon of lights rises and dances.
    Forever immortal for thousands of generations,
    A steel dam stands in the middle of the stream!
    A socialist industrial pillar,
    Standing in the magnificent historical midstream!

    新“中流砥柱”
    吴烟痕
    锁住孽龙
    道光二十三，大王显手段，冲走太阳渡，捎带万锦滩，脚蹬三门庙，鞭打史家滩。——黄河民谣
    在高高的导水墙上，
    一位老人手扶着拐杖，
    穿过看水的人群，
    来把七月的洪峰欣赏。
    喜听那狂流的哀号，
    喜见那浪花飞落在身上，
    老人在墙头上往返，
    高兴得挥舞起手中的拐杖。
    他说人门是把大锁，
    紧紧卡在孽龙的脖子上；
    又说人门是条缰绳，
    牵住孽龙的鼻子走向东方。
    从此不怕洪水涨上天，
    从此不怕涛声震人心脏；
    有了降龙的英雄，
    再凶的猛兽也要驯服如羊。
    明年秋后再来观看，
    困锁的孽龙当会吐出电光，
    化成千串万串明珠，
    为锦绣河山献一身新装。
    在高高的导水墙上，
    一位老人挥舞着拐杖，
    穿过看水的人群，
    在把七月的洪峰欣赏。
    新“中流砥柱”三门之下，奔腾的激流中，屹立着一座石峰，即自古传颂之“中流砥柱”。有象征我民族性格之说。如今，拦河大坝横断三门，人们说：这是新的“中流砥柱”！
    我们铸造新的砥柱，
    钢铁大坝立在中流！
    南踩秦岭，北蹬太行，
    威严地镇住在三门之上。
    俯视那云中的昆仑，
    黄河之水在地下奔腾，
    像一支雄劲的乐队，
    送来欢乐豪放的曲音。
    背后是浩瀚的大海，
    东风吹动澎湃的涛声，
    像人海掀起欢呼，
    旌旗招展，金鼓齐鸣
    背靠大海，俯视昆仑，
    屹立在万里黄河的中心！
    头上旋转日月星宿，
    万水千山都来致敬。
    伸手抱起一湖碧水，
    如同高举幸福的酒杯；
    顺手抛出串串灯火，
    那灯的巨龙腾空起舞。
    千秋万代永垂不朽，
    钢铁大坝立在中流！
    社会主义的工业砥柱，
    屹立在壮阔的历史中流！
