    Jieshi Commune Party Committee Strengthens Leadership
    Agricultural Middle School Achieves New Development

    (Our report) The Jieshi People's Commune in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, had a total of 575 graduating senior primary school students this year. Among them, 285 students could be admitted to ordinary middle schools according to the state enrollment plan, and 20 students participated in productive labor and studied in spare-time middle schools. In order to accommodate the remaining 270 students in agricultural middle schools, the commune party committee developed the commune's agricultural middle schools from one school with two classes to five schools with seven classes.

    Based on the principle of "unified leadership and hierarchical management" of the commune, the commune party committee adopted three forms of developing agricultural middle schools: First, the commune runs the school, with the school site located in the commune's location, absorbing nearby students, and directly led by the commune party committee; second, several management areas jointly run the school. This form is generally adopted when the management areas are close to each other (no more than six li at the furthest). It is led by a school affairs committee composed of the directors of each management area, the secretary in charge of culture and education, parent representatives, and the person in charge of the agricultural middle school; third, one management area runs the school independently. This form is adopted by management areas where there are many students and specific issues such as teachers and equipment can be resolved.

    The Party Committee also made proper arrangements for the time spent on study and productive labor. It is stipulated that two methods should be adopted: half-day study, half-day labor, and alternate-day study, alternate-day labor. It is also stipulated that according to the production season, production teams should contract for work, quantity, time, and people, so that study and productive labor are closely integrated to improve teaching quality.

    The issues of teachers and funding for agricultural middle schools have also been properly resolved. The source and allocation of teachers follow the principles of "the capable can be teachers, use local materials" and "one class with more teachers, few classes with fewer teachers." Eleven teachers were selected from intellectuals and demobilized soldiers in the commune.

    In order to further consolidate the agricultural middle school and improve teaching quality, short-term training was also conducted for new teachers, with teachers from Jiezhou Middle School providing guidance and introducing school-running experience. The commune party committee also decided to give teachers a current affairs report once a month.

    解时公社党委加强领导
    农业中学有新发展
    本报讯　山西省运城县解时人民公社，今年共有应届高小毕业生五百七十五人，其中除二百八十五人可按国家招生计划，考入普通中学，二十人参加生产劳动在业余中学学习外，为了安置其余二百七十名学生都进农业中学学习，公社党委又把全社的农业中学由一校、两班发展到五校、七班。
    公社党委根据公社“统一领导，分级管理”的原则，采取了三种发展农业中学形式：一是公社办，校址设在公社所在地，吸收附近学生入学，由公社党委直接领导；二是几个管理区联办，采取这种形式一般是各管理区距离较近（最远不过六里），由各管理区主任、负责文教的书记、家长代表及农业中学负责人所组成的校务委员会领导；三是一个管理区独办，采取这种形式的管理区，一般是学生多，师资、设备等具体问题都能解决。
    对学习和生产劳动的时间，党委也作了妥善安排。规定采取半天学习，半天劳动，和隔日学习，隔日劳动两种办法。并规定：根据生产季节与生产队包活、包量、定时、定人，使学习与生产劳动密切结合，提高教学质量。
    对于农业中学的师资、经费等问题，也获得了妥善解决。教师的来源和配备，根据“能者为师，就地取材”和“一班多配、班多少配”的原则，从在社知识分子和复员军人中选拔了十一名教师。
    为了进一步巩固农业中学，提高教学质量，还对新教师进行短期训练，请解州中学教师辅导，介绍办学经验。社党委还确定每月为教师作一次时事报告。
