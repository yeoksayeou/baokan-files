Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th: Over 200,000 coal mine workers in Liaoning Province, inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have achieved successive victories and have already exceeded the third quarter's raw coal production plan by 4,000 tons five days and six hours ahead of schedule, offering a great gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. Production preparation work such as tunneling and stripping, as well as the overhaul of mechanical equipment, have also been done excellently, creating conditions for continued great leaps forward in production in the fourth quarter.

The fundamental reason for the continuous over-fulfillment of production tasks and the straight-line increase in production levels on the coal industry front in Liaoning Province during the third quarter is the conscientious reliance on the leadership of the Party, adherence to putting politics in command, and holding high the red flag of the general line. After criticizing right-leaning thoughts, the cadres also promoted the excellent style of eating, living, and laboring alongside the workers. The broad masses of workers gave full play to their soaring energy and boundless wisdom, responding to the Party's call with actions of hard work, solid work, and ingenious work. The province-wide red flag competition for large-scale bumper harvests in coal mines has seen a new climax in September. At the same time, while vigorously grasping coal production, the leadership has also focused on production preparation and equipment maintenance, thereby increasing the amount of recoverable coal. Since the beginning of September, 430 meters of new coal mining faces have been added, creating conditions for the rapid increase in coal production.

At present, the coal mine workers in Liaoning Province are, on the one hand, advancing victoriously, fighting to increase coal production by 700,000 tons by the end of the month; on the other hand, they are actively preparing, determined to achieve a good start in production in October, and striving to overfulfill the fourth quarter plan and the plan to increase coal production by 2 million tons for the whole year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th: Coal mine workers in Shandong exceeded the September coal mining plan by 90,000 tons, completing it five days ahead of schedule.

The call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has given tremendous encouragement to the more than 100,000 coal mine workers in Shandong Province. At the end of August and the beginning of September, various localities held oath-taking rallies for the coal seizing battle, boosting energy, expressing determination, and formulating leap forward plans, quickly launching a broader and more in-depth large-scale bumper harvest competition movement. Coal production in the province rose sharply in a straight line: the average daily output in the first ten days of the month reached 63,106 tons, and in the middle ten days of the month it rose to 68,373 tons; from the 19th, the daily output exceeded 70,000 tons, with the highest daily output reaching more than 74,800 tons.

The small coal mines built during the Great Leap Forward last year have shown a huge role in increasing production. More than 100 small coal mines in the province, after varying degrees of technological transformation, have produced more than 3 million tons of raw coal for the state this year, powerfully supporting industrial and agricultural production.

The leading personnel of coal mines in various localities continue to go deep into the grassroots level, break through key problems together with the workers, and vigorously organize regular cyclical operations, promoting the continuous development of production. After the party and government leaders of the Xinwen Mining Bureau went deep into the three key mines of Suncun, Zhangzhuang, and Liangzhuang respectively, they assisted them in taking measures to allocate and dispatch transportation carts separately, enabling the twelve regular working faces of the three mines to embark on regular cycles, and the output rapidly increased.

At present, coal mines throughout the province are seizing the last few days of September, striving to produce more coal this month, while actively carrying out various preparations for completing the coal mining tasks for the fourth quarter ahead of schedule and in excess.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 26th: Henan Province's 200,000-strong coal army worked hard in August and September, completing the third quarter's production plan of 5.5 million tons of raw coal seven days ahead of schedule and exceeding it by 47,000 tons. Together with the output in the first half of this year, the province's coal output has already approached the total output of last year.

After opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting their energy, especially inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the province's coal workers are in high spirits and becoming increasingly motivated, expressing their determination to resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction with practical actions of continuous leaps forward. The province's raw coal output was higher every ten days, with the average daily output of raw coal being 55,000 tons in July, rising to 89,000 tons in mid-September, an increase of 68% compared with July. The ash content of raw coal, pit wood consumption, and production costs have also been reduced compared with before. The tunneling speed has also been greatly accelerated, with the tunneling footage in the first ten days of September increasing by 33% compared with the first ten days of August.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 27th: Coal mine workers in Jilin Province overfulfilled the production plans for the third quarter and September respectively on the 25th and 26th. At present, the workers are determined to make persistent efforts, and by the end of the month, they will overproduce 220,000 tons more than the third quarter plan and 170,000 tons more than the September plan, as a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

In the major battles of August and September, the Jilin Province Coal Mining Bureau and coal mines further carried forward the excellent style of the Great Leap Forward last year. Leading cadres went to the front line of production, deep into the pits to participate in production, and lead production. Mines, sections, and teams in various coal mines actively launched competitor contests, and strengthened the promotion of advanced experience and the implementation of rationalization proposals in the competition, greatly tapping production potential and improving production levels. After the Yingcheng Coal Mine promoted advanced experiences such as four-shift cross-operation and blasting and coal loading in the coal mining team, production has been steadily increasing since September. Since the 18th, the output of the entire mine has reached more than 4,400 tons, exceeding the daily plan by more than 300 tons. After the Sixth Mine's Southern First Workplace and the Third Mine's Northern Eleventh Workplace of the Jiaohe Coal Mine promoted advanced coal mining experience, the daily output increased from 200 tons to 300 tons.

    辽宁山东河南吉林煤矿职工九月战斗大获全胜
    秣马厉兵迎战四季度
    新华社沈阳26日电　辽宁省二十多万煤矿职工，在党的八届八中全会伟大号召鼓舞下，连战连捷，已经提前五天零六小时超额四千吨完成了第三季度的原煤生产计划，给建国十周年献上一份厚礼。掘进和剥离等生产准备工作以及机械设备检修工作，也都做得很出色，给第四季度生产继续大跃进创造了条件。
    辽宁省煤炭工业战线第三季度月月超额完成生产任务，生产水平直线上升。根本原因是认真依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，高举总路线的红旗。干部们在批判右倾思想之后，又发扬了和工人同吃、同住、同劳动的优良作风。广大职工发挥冲天干劲和无穷智慧，纷纷用苦干实干巧干的行动响应党的号召。全省煤矿大面积丰产红旗竞赛在9月份出现了新的高潮。同时，领导方面在大抓煤炭生产的同时，狠抓生产准备和设备检修工作，因而可采获得煤量增加，从9月初开始增加了四百三十米新采煤工作面，为煤炭产量迅速提高创造了条件。
    目前，辽宁省各煤矿的职工正一面乘胜猛进，为到月末增产七十万吨煤炭而战；一面积极准备，决心实现10月份生产开门红，为超额完成第四季度计划、全年增产二百万吨煤炭的计划而奋勇前进。
    新华社济南26日电　山东煤矿职工超额九万吨提前五天完成了9月份采煤计划。
    党的八届八中全会的号召，给山东省十几万名煤矿职工以巨大的鼓舞。8月底9月初，各地纷纷举行夺煤大战誓师大会，鼓干劲，表决心，制订跃进计划，迅速掀起了一个更为广泛、深入的大面积丰产竞赛运动。全省煤产量直线高升：上旬平均日产量达到了六万三千一百零六吨，中旬又提高到六万八千三百七十三吨；从19日开始，日产量突破了七万吨，最高日产量达到七万四千八百多吨。
    去年大跃进期间兴建起来的小煤井，在增产中显示了巨大的作用。全省经过不同程度技术改造的一百多座小煤井，今年已为国家生产了三百多万吨原煤，有力地支援了工农业生产。
    各地煤矿的领导人员继续深入基层，同工人一起破关键，大力组织正规循环作业，促进了生产不断向前发展。新汶矿务局的党政领导干部分别深入孙村、张庄、良庄三个重点矿后，就协助他们采取分头调配运搬车皮的措施，使三个矿的十二个正规工作面都走上了正规循环，产量迅速上升。
    目前，全省各煤矿正在抓紧9月的最后几天，一方面力争在本月超产更多的煤炭，一方面在积极地为提前超额完成四季度的采煤任务进行各项准备工作。
    据新华社郑州26日电　河南省二十万煤炭大军大干8、9月份，提前七天超额四万七千吨完成了第三季度五百五十万吨原煤的生产计划。加上今年上半年的产量，全省煤炭产量已经接近去年全年的产量。
    全省煤炭职工经过反右倾、鼓干劲，特别是在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，斗志昂扬，干劲愈来愈足，纷纷表示要以不断跃进的实际行动坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线。全省原煤产量一旬高过一旬，平均原煤日产量7月份为五万五千吨，到9月中旬上升到八万九千吨，比7月份提高68％。原煤灰分、坑木消耗、生产成本也都比以前降低。掘进速度也大大加快了，9月上旬的掘进进尺比8月上旬提高了33％。
    据新华社长春27日电　吉林省煤矿职工，在25、26两日分别超额完成第三季度和9月份的生产计划。目前，职工们决心再接再厉，到月末比第三季度计划超产二十二万吨，比9月份计划超产十七万吨原煤，向建国十周年献礼。
    吉林省各矿务局和煤矿在大战8、9月份中，进一步发扬了去年大跃进中的优良作风，领导干部亲临生产第一线，深入井下参加生产，领导生产。各煤矿的井、段、队之间纷纷开展对手竞赛，并在竞赛中加强推广先进经验及实现合理化建议的工作，大大挖掘了生产潜力，提高了生产水平。营城煤矿在采煤工作队中推广了四班交叉作业、爆破装煤等先进经验后，9月以来生产一直稳步上升，从18日起，全矿产量已经达到四千四百吨以上，超过日计划三百多吨。蛟河煤矿六井南一道场子和三井北十一道场子，推广先进采煤经验以后，日产量都由二百吨提高到三百吨。
