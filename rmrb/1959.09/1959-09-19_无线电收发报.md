    The "da-di, da-di" signals coming from the receiver, the contestants wearing headphones listening and copying, quickly and accurately copying the telegrams, or pressing the key non-stop to send telegrams, this is a national defense sports item—radio telegraphy.

    Radio competitions are divided into receiving and sending, with a total of nine competition events. Receiving and sending each include code (Latin letters), long code (Arabic numerals) and short code (Arabic numerals). The three receiving items are further divided into competitions using a typewriter or handwritten.

    Radio competitions test speed and accuracy, requiring contestants to have extremely keen judgment. In addition to men's and women's individual competitions, team rankings are also determined.

    In the radio sending competition, each contestant has two sending opportunities, with the best one used to determine the score. Each competition involves sending long code, short code, and character code, each lasting five minutes. The total number of characters sent is reduced by the number of errors, and the average number of characters per minute is calculated, with each character worth one point. Receiving competitions are conducted separately for machine copying and handwriting. Men and women contestants copy long code, short code, and character code at the specified speeds, and the scores for each speed are evaluated according to the prescribed scoring standards, and the total score is calculated using a cumulative method.

    Radio, known as "all-hearing ears," is fast and economical, and is not limited by mountains or oceans. It has very important value in national defense and economic construction. Through radio activities, the vast number of young people can master military communications technology and can carry out communication liaison in various economic constructions. Radio competitions have now become one of the international competition events. (Xinhua News Agency)

    无线电收发报
    收讯机发出的哒的哒的讯号，戴着耳机的选手们一边听一边抄，迅速而准确地抄收着电报，或者按着电键不停地发报，这是国防体育的一个项目——无线电收发报。
    无线电竞赛分收报和发报两种，共有九个竞赛项目。收发报各包括字码（拉丁字）、长码（阿拉伯数字）和短码（阿拉伯数字）三项，收报的三项又按打字机抄和手抄分别进行竞赛。
    无线电竞赛比速度、比准确，要求选手有极敏锐的判别力。除男、女个人分别进行单项竞赛外，还决定团体名次。
    无线电发报比赛每个选手都有两次发报机会，以其中最好的一次评定成绩。每次竞赛都要拍发长码、短码、字码三项，每项拍发时间都是五分钟，从拍发中的总字数中扣去错字，计算出每分钟平均字数，按每字一分计分。收报竞赛机抄和手抄分别进行。男、女选手按长码、短码、字码规定的各个速度抄收，按规定得分标准评定各速度的分数，并以累积方法计算总分。
    无线电有“顺风耳”之称，既快又省，不受山峰海洋的限制，在国防建设和经济建设上都有着十分重要的价值。通过无线电活动，可以使广大青少年掌握军事通讯联络技术，可以在各项经济建设中进行通讯联系。无线电竞赛现在已成了国际竞赛项目之一。　（新华社）
