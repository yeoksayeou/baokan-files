Xinhua News Agency, 28th - In recent days, fraternal countries have been widely and enthusiastically celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
        Soviet Union
    In the Soviet Union, tens of thousands of propagandists and speakers are giving reports in factories, mines, collective farms, and government offices, introducing the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction. Recently, the Kyrgyz branch of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and the Kyrgyz Republic Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge organized about three hundred such reports. Various cities and villages in the Soviet Union also organized garden parties, exhibitions of Chinese books and pictures, Chinese film weeks, and concerts to celebrate China's National Day. Many Soviet newspapers have recently published articles introducing the historic progress in the lives of the Chinese people.
      Korea
    Today, the Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a special issue on Korean-Chinese friendship on its fourth page, featuring articles, communications, poems, and paintings praising Korean-Chinese friendship. An article entitled "Immortal Friendship" described the solid friendship forged between the peoples of Korea and China in the common struggle against Japanese and American imperialism.
      Vietnam
    Nguyen Khang, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and former Vietnamese Ambassador to China, published an article in the Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" on the 26th, enthusiastically introducing the great achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction over the past ten years. He pointed out that the general line for building socialism formulated by the Chinese Communist Party has great significance and effect. It has tapped the enormous potential of the broad masses of people, made full use of China's rich experience in production, and promoted China's rapid development in all aspects, enabling it to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule.
      Mongolia
    Mongolian newspapers have continuously published articles and pictures introducing China's achievements in socialist construction in recent days. Factories, farms, pastoral areas, and cooperatives continue to hold exhibitions, reports, and get-togethers related to China.
    The latest issue of the "Mongolian Culture and Literary Association Newspaper" published Mongolian translations of Chairman Mao Zedong's six poems, including "沁园春" (Qin Yuan Chun), at the top of the special column for the fifteen-day "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Activities."
        Poland
    To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country, Wierbłan, member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and head of the Central Propaganda Department, published an article in the latest issue of "Political Weekly" entitled "The Great Decade." The article said that in the course of ten years, China has experienced unprecedented social and economic development. Today, there is every reason to call this country a great power. Without China's participation, it is difficult to solve important international problems. The founding of the People's Republic of China added 600 million people to the socialist camp, changing the balance of power in the world. The article pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party has accumulated rich experience in the struggle for power and in socialist construction. This experience is also of great significance to the international communist movement.
