The Sooner, The Better
	Liu Di

	In a few more days, it will be the tenth anniversary of the founding of our motherland. We sing songs of triumph to welcome this auspicious day, and we stride forward to push the wheel of history towards this day!

	Looking around, how magnificent and rapid are our strides forward;
	At the National Games, swimmer Mu Xiangxiong broke the world record for the 100-meter breaststroke with a time of 1 minute 11.1 seconds; Wei Gaohou, a young milling machine operator at the Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, completed four months' worth of work in thirteen days; in mid-September, steelworkers at Anshan Iron and Steel created the highest ten-day steel production in the history of Anshan Iron and Steel; the new 3,000-ton freighter built by the Hudong Shipyard was launched in just nineteen days; and in Beijing, some large-scale buildings were completed in less than a year from the start of construction....

	These are unusual speeds, the speeds of the Great Leap Forward! Faced with such high speeds, listening to the sound of our motherland's leaping progress, how can we not raise our arms and cheer for such great victories. However, these are just the achievements created in a short period of a few days or months. If we look back at the ten years we have traveled, it will be even more exciting. Ten years is such a brief moment in the long river of human history, but in this fleeting moment, a dilapidated old China has suddenly turned into a radiant new China. Even though we try our best to search for the memories of ten years ago, we still cannot imagine how much it has changed. In ten years, we have gone from being "empty-handed" to increasing steel production by seventy-five times; in ten years, we have driven away hunger, producing 550 billion catties of grain a year; in ten years, we have embarked on the broad road of building socialism....

	The conclusion of history is stern. When we had just stood up on our own land, weren't the imperialists calculating the days of our downfall? However, only ten years have passed, and now they are worried about the speed of the oriental dragon's leap forward. The path we have traveled in ten years far exceeds the path traveled by some capitalist countries in decades or even a century, which naturally cannot but cause them to slander us in addition to panic. However, let them laugh and scold as they please, we will do good things ourselves, and our pace forward is getting faster and faster.

	We are becoming increasingly clear that high-speed progress is the expression of the lofty will of the working people of our country. The people demand to quickly change the "poor and blank" face left over from old China, to get rid of poverty, to change from poor to rich, and to hope that it will be as soon as possible. The Party considered the fundamental interests and ardent demands of the people and proposed the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This general line is like a thunderclap, illuminating all work and also illuminating people's thoughts. As a result, people's revolutionary drive is like an erupting volcano, and the speed of the Great Leap Forward was born from this great force.

	The imperialists and right-leaning opportunists have educated us from the opposite side. Let us see more clearly: the faster the speed of construction, the better, the more things are done, the better, because the faster we move, the closer we get to that great goal, and the happier the lives of our people will be. Those who shout "It's too fast," "It's too early," and "It's going to cause trouble" are deeply infected with the virus and cannot even stand on their own feet, and they still want to stop the vehicles from moving forward, and in the end, they only play an inglorious role. You see, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, isn't our speed of progress even faster? What's wrong with being so fast? It not only did not "cause trouble," but also "broke through" a more beautiful situation.

    愈快愈好
    柳笛
    再过几天，就是我们祖国建国十周年的纪念日。我们高唱着凯歌迎接这个吉庆的日子，我们昂首阔步推动着历史的车轮向这个日子猛进！
    纵目四望，我们前进的步伐多么雄壮，多么迅速；
    全运会上，游泳运动员穆祥雄以一分十一秒一的速度打破百米蛙泳的世界纪录；重庆长安机器厂青年铣工魏高厚十三天完成四个月的工作量；鞍山钢铁工人9月中旬创造了鞍钢有史以来钢铁旬产量的最高纪录；沪东造船厂新建的三千吨货轮只用了十九天的时间下水；而在北京，规模宏伟的一些大建筑，从开工到建成用了不到一年的时间……。
    这是一些不平常的速度，是大跃进的速度！面对着这样的高速度，倾听着祖国飞跃前进的脚步声，我们怎能不为这种巨大的胜利振臂高呼。然而，这不过是短短几天或者几个月的时间内所创造的成绩。如果回过头来看一看我们走过的十年的道路，那就更加使人兴奋不已了。十年，在人类历史的长河中是多么短暂的一刹那，可是就在这一转瞬的刹那间，一个破烂不堪的旧中国骤然变成了金光灿然的新中国。尽管我们竭力去搜索十年前的记忆，仍然无法想像它已经起了多么大的变化。十年，我们从“手无寸铁”到钢产量增长七十五倍；十年，我们赶走了饥饿，一年生产五千五百亿斤粮食；十年，我们走上了建设社会主义的康庄大道……。
    历史的结论是严峻的。当着我们刚刚从自己的土地上站立起来的时候，帝国主义者不是就在计算我们倒台的日子吗？可是，时间只过了十年，他们现在却在担心着东方巨龙飞跃前进的速度了。我们十年走过的道路，远远超过了一些资本主义国家几十年，甚至一个世纪走过的道路，这自然不能不使他们在惊慌失措之外，对我们横加污蔑和诽谤了。然而，笑骂由他笑骂，好事我自为之，我们前进的步伐反而愈来愈快了。
    我们愈来愈清楚地知道，高速度前进，正是我国劳动人民崇高意志的表现。人民群众要求迅速改变旧中国遗留下来的“一穷二白”的面貌，要求摆脱贫困，由穷变富，而且希望愈快愈好。党考虑了人民群众的根本利益和殷切要求，提出了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。这条总路线像春雷一声震天响，它照亮了一切工作，也照亮了人们的思想，于是，人们的革命干劲像迸发的火山一样，大跃进的速度从这种伟大的力量中诞生了。
    帝国主义者和右倾机会主义者，从反面教育了我们。让我们更清楚地看到：建设的速度愈快愈好，事情办得愈多愈好，因为我们的步子迈得愈快，我们就和那个伟大的目标愈加靠近，我国人民的生活也就愈加幸福了。那些大叫“搞快了”“搞早了”“要闯祸了”的人，病毒已深，自己连脚跟都站不稳，还想拦住车辆前进，结果只落得扮演了一个不光采的脚色。你看，党的八届八中全会以后，我们前进的速度不是更加快了吗？这样快有什么不好？它不仅没有“闯祸”，而且“闯”出了一个更加美好的局面。
