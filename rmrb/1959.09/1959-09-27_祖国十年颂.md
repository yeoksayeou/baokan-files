    Ode to the Motherland's Ten Years
    Huang Yanpei

    Compatriots of the motherland have now turned over and stand up,
    The whole people rise up to be their own masters.
    With the Party's leadership, we gain direction,
    Socialism strides forward on its journey.
    Everyone contributes their skills and wisdom,
    Production leaps forward, industry and agriculture surge ahead.
    A thousand miles a day like swift steeds running,
    Education eliminates illiteracy, popularizing culture.
    People have enough food and clothing, warm and well-fed,
    People's Communes are universally praised.
    Combining industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs into one.
    All that has been achieved in these ten years,
    Also includes overcoming hardships and difficulties.
    A myriad of sights at Tiananmen,
    Brand new buildings soar into the blue sky.
    One person ascends the stage like the sun rising in the east,
    The masses clap their hands like spring thunder.
    Turning back, a monument stands a hundred zhang tall,
    Sleeping peacefully underground with a smile are the heroic souls.
