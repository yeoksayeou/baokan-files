Xinhua News Agency, 6th: A timber production overproduction campaign has been launched. Encouraged by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, forestry workers across the country have launched a competition to strive to overfulfill this year's timber production plan. In the first year of the Great Leap Forward, timber production has already victoriously overfulfilled the targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan, four years ahead of schedule.

Significant achievements have been made in focusing on timber production in the third quarter. By the end of July, the timber transported to state timber yards or allocation points by various forest areas had increased by 26.1% compared with the same period last year. Entering August, the enthusiasm of the vast number of forestry workers became even higher. The total output of logs in various places in August increased by 10% compared with July. As of August 31, the various forest areas had shipped a total of more than 27.18 million cubic meters of timber this year, accounting for 71.5% of the annual plan. Heilongjiang Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which undertake nearly two-fifths of the country's timber supply, have completed 81.3% of the annual production plan.

Currently, from the northern forest areas to the southern forest areas, a high tide of competition to rush timber and strive for overproduction has been set off everywhere. Forestry workers in Heilongjiang Province, in response to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, are striving to increase the production of logs by another 1.8 million cubic meters and finished timber by 260,000 cubic meters on the basis of comprehensively completing the annual plan. By calculating detailed accounts, finding shortcuts, and tapping potential, they have formulated new production increase and conservation plans and put forward concrete measures. Everyone is chasing each other, and the scene is boiling. The Cuiluan Forestry Bureau also victoriously completed the annual task more than four months ahead of schedule and is courageously advancing towards the 70,000 cubic meter production increase plan. After the Shuangzihe Forestry Bureau launched a competition with the Shangganling Forestry Bureau, the level of timber production has been rising steadily. The second five-day period in August increased by 6% compared with the first five-day period, and the third five-day period increased by 8% compared with the second five-day period. After the Chaihe Forestry Bureau's forest railway workers improved the train operation diagram, the number of train pairs increased from seven pairs per day to 8.6 pairs, so the annual transportation plan will be completed two months ahead of schedule. Worker Li Fushan also created a flatcar gate switch, increasing efficiency by 3.5 times. Linjiang, Tanghe and other ten forestry bureaus in Jilin Province have launched a red flag competition for high output, high quality, high efficiency and low cost. In addition to ensuring the comprehensive completion of this year's production plan, the workers will also increase timber production by 120,000 cubic meters to support construction in various places. The timber collection workers of the Tanghe Forestry Bureau promoted wooden track slides, wooden chutes, and aerial ropeways, reducing the labor intensity of timber collection, and the efficiency was generally increased by more than one time. The loading and unloading worker Wang Lanxiang created a method of loading wood on flatcars by laying small iron rails on the wood piles, so that the flatcars can be directly pushed to the piles to unload wood, increasing efficiency by more than three times and greatly accelerating vehicle turnover. In terms of mechanical timber transportation, emphasis has been placed on strengthening equipment maintenance and implementing automobile trains to transport more and faster, greatly improving timber transportation efficiency and closely linking timber transportation and timber collection. The No. 6 contracted vehicle team, Wang Zhenqing's team, took the lead in creating a new record for transporting more and faster, exceeding the original plan by 45% within one shift. Immediately afterwards, Wang Zhongwu's team also reached the level of Wang Zhenqing's team. Encouraged by them, various contracted vehicle teams put forward the battle cry of "Catch up with Wang Zhenqing and surpass Wang Zhongwu," and quickly caught up, and the efficiency of timber transportation generally increased by more than 40%.

The southern forest areas are seizing the current favorable season and rushing to transport the timber accumulated in the mountains and small streams. Fujian Province rationally allocated labor, transferring labor from counties with small timber production tasks to support counties with large tasks, and organized 65 water transportation brigades with more than 3,000 water transportation workers to transport in sections, greatly accelerating the progress of timber transportation. Jian'ou County had completed the annual timber transportation plan on August 17. Now this county has decided to increase this year's timber transportation plan from 410,000 cubic meters to 500,000 cubic meters. The workers in the Yidu forest area of Hubei Province worked hard and cleverly, promoting timber transportation tools such as antennas, slides, and carts, and comprehensively utilizing large and small streams, realizing combined transportation of mountains, land, and water from the mountains to the bottom of the mountains, from land to water, which not only doubled work efficiency, but also greatly saved labor and reduced transportation costs. The workers of the Qiyang County forest farms in Hunan Province launched a "ten comparisons" competition with timber transportation as the center, including "comparing progress, comparing enthusiasm, comparing innovation, comparing safety, comparing cooperation, and comparing management." As of August 20, the county had completed 94.38% of this year's timber transportation plan.

    木材生产超产运动展开
    各林区已运出的木材占全年计划的71.5％
    据新华社6日讯　木材生产的超产运动展开了。全国林业职工在党的八届八中全会鼓舞下，为争取超额完成今年木材生产计划掀起了竞赛。在大跃进的第一年，木材生产已经胜利地提前四年超额完成了第二个五年计划规定的指标。
    木材生产大抓第三季度已获成绩。7月底，各林区运到国家贮木场或调拨点的木材比去年同期增加了26.1％，进入8月，广大林业职工的干劲更加高涨。8月份各地原木产量总计比7月份又上升10％。截至8月31日为止，各林区今年共已运出木材二千七百一十八万多立方米，占全年计划的71.5％；承担全国木材供应量近五分之二的黑龙江省和内蒙古自治区，已完成全年生产计划的81.3％。
    现在，从北方林区到南方林区，到处都掀起了抢运木材、力争超产的竞赛高潮。黑龙江省林业职工响应省委的号召，力争在全面完成年计划的基础上，再增产原木一百八十万立方米、成材二十六万立方米。他们通过算细账、找窍门、挖潜力，订出了新的增产节约计划，提出了具体措施，你追我赶，一片沸腾。翠峦林业局也提前四个多月胜利完成全年任务，正在为七万立方米的增产计划奋勇前进。双子河林业局向上甘岭林业局发起竞赛后，木材生产水平步步上升，8月份第二个五日比第一个五日上升6％，第三个五日又比第二个五日上升8％。柴河林业局森林铁路职工改进了行车运行图后，由每天开七个对次提高到八点六个对次，这样，全年运输计划就将提前两月完成。工人李福山并且创造了台车闸门开关器，提高效率三点五倍。吉林省的临江，汤河等十个林业局，都开展了高产、优质、高效率和低成本的红旗竞赛。职工们除保证全面完成今年生产计划外，还要再增产木材十二万立方米，支援各地建设。汤河林业局的集材工人推广了木轨滑道、木滑槽、架空索道、降低了集材劳动强度，效率普遍提高一倍以上。装卸工人王兰香创造了平车上木方法，把小铁轨铺到木堆上，平车便直接推到堆上卸木，提高效率三倍多，车辆周转大大加快。机械运材方面着重加强了设备维修，实行了汽车列车化，多拉快运，大力提高运材效率，使运材和集材紧密衔接起来。六号包车组王振清班首先创造了多拉快运的新纪录，一班之内超额45％完成原计划。紧接着王忠武班也达到王振清班的水平。各个包车组在他们的鼓舞下，提出了“赶上王振清，超过王忠武”的战斗口号，急起直追，运材效率普遍提高40％以上。
    南方各林区正抓紧当前有利季节，抢运山场和小溪积存的木材。福建省合理调配劳力，从木材生产任务小的县抽调劳力支援任务大的县，组织六十五个水运大队，三千多名水运工人分段流送，运材进度大大加快。建瓯县在8月17日已完成全年运材计划，现在这个县决定把今年运材计划从四十一万立方米增加到五十万立方米。湖北省宜都林区工人苦干加巧干，推广天线、滑道、车子等运材工具，全面利用大小溪沟，从山上到山下，从陆路到水上，实现了山、陆、水的联运，不仅工效成倍提高，并且大大节省了劳力，降低了运输费用。湖南省祁阳县各林场职工开展了以运材为中心的“比进度、比干劲、比革新、比安全、比协作、比管理”等“十比”竞赛，到8月20日止，全县已完成今年运材计划的94.38％。
