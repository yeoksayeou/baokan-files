Comrades!

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations on the victorious opening of the First National Games of the People's Republic of China, and extend a warm welcome to the guests present!

This National Games is being held amidst the jubilant atmosphere of the people of the whole country warmly responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and launching a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, striving to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year, and greeting the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic with brilliant achievements. In these glorious ten years, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have achieved unprecedented great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction with the heroic spirit of "mountains bowing their heads and rivers giving way."

Our country's sports undertakings, due to the resolute implementation of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's policy of developing mass sports activities to serve production and national defense, have also achieved tremendous achievements in the past ten years. Especially since 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and inspired and promoted by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the people's communization movement, and the movement of the whole people becoming soldiers, both the popularization of mass sports and the improvement of sports technical levels have achieved leap-forward development and remarkable results. This has played a very beneficial and positive role in ensuring and coordinating the completion of production, work, and study tasks. Now hundreds of millions of people across the country regularly participate in sports activities. Broadcast gymnastics has become a part of the daily life of the broad masses of the people. In the movement of the whole people becoming soldiers to defend the security of the motherland, shooting and martial arts have become the hobbies of millions of people, and many excellent shooters have emerged. A large number of people have passed the Labor and Defense System and the standards for graded athletes.

In the extensive mass sports movement, countless outstanding athletes have emerged, and the technical level has also improved rapidly. Since liberation, our athletes have created and broken national records more than 2,800 times, and a world champion has emerged. This has never happened in Chinese history. In 1956 and 1957, only three people broke three world records six times, while in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, nine people created six world records eight times, more than doubling the previous figures. In the continuing Great Leap Forward year of 1959, from January to August alone, 29 people broke 12 world records in 12 events, which greatly advanced our country's technical level.

The rapid development of our country's sports is inseparable from the enthusiastic enthusiasm of the people of the whole country in building socialism, and it is also inseparable from the nationwide Great Leap Forward. It is inconceivable that without the change in the people's mental outlook, without the development of production and the improvement of material life, such a good situation would have emerged in the people's sports movement. All this shows that the broad masses of working people in our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have not only completely turned over politically and improved their economic life, but also have significantly strengthened their physique.

The tremendous achievements made in our country's sports undertakings are the result of the consistent attention and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, as well as the People's Government, to sports and the infinite concern for the physical health of the working people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the state listed sports as an important part of the socialist construction cause. Chairman Mao's instruction on "Develop sports and enhance the people's physique" and the Party Central Committee's instruction on "Improving the people's health and enhancing the people's physique is an important political task of the Party" and "one of the important means of carrying out communist education for the working people" have pointed out a clear direction and opened up a broad road for our country's sports. The Party and the state have also created sufficient material conditions for the development of sports. For example, in terms of training cadres, sports colleges or sports schools have been generally established in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and youth amateur sports schools have also achieved vigorous development; many stadiums and gymnasiums have also been built in various places, which are important bases for the masses to carry out physical exercise and improve sports technical levels.

In future work, we must resolutely implement the policy of sports serving production and national defense. Strengthen the leadership of the Party, put politics in command, oppose right-leaning ideology, hold high the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and continue to implement the principle of combining popularization with improvement. Learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brother countries. Popularize mass sports, enhance the people's physique, accelerate the improvement of sports technical levels, and constantly create new records, especially improving the performance of major sports. Promote our country's sports to a new stage of more widespread and in-depth development.

This National Games, held to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, is unprecedented in scale in our country, including 42 competition and performance events. In the process of preparing for the conference, it has received the cordial care of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, and the warm support of the broad masses of the people. More than 10,000 athletes from all ethnic groups are participating in this National Games, and they have been selected from the grassroots, counties, cities, and provinces. A total of more than 50 million workers, peasants, students, cadres, and soldiers participated in the selection of this conference, forming a climax of participating in sports activities, and have repeatedly created provincial, municipal, autonomous region records, national records, and world records, fully embodying the policy of combining the popularization and improvement of sports work. This National Games will not only review the achievements made in our country's sports in the past ten years, but also be a martial arts arena to show the communist style of our people striving for progress. The purpose of the National Games is to unite sports workers across the country, promote the development of mass sports activities, and create outstanding achievements in several sports. I hope that all comrades in the conference will follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee, put politics in command, go all out, aim high, and give full play to the communist style of daring to think and act and excellent moral character. Work together with one heart and one mind, unite as one, be conscientious and responsible, and learn modestly. Be neither arrogant in victory nor discouraged in defeat, and create excellent achievements in every possible way with the heroic spirit of the Chinese people in the era of the Great Leap Forward, and make the National Games successful and splendid!

Celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

    把全运会开好开得精彩
    贺龙同志在全运会上的开幕辞
    同志们：
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会和国务院，衷心祝贺中华人民共和国第一届运动会胜利地开幕，并向到会的来宾表示热烈的欢迎！
    这次运动会，是在全国人民热烈响应党的八届八中全会号召，反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起增产节约运动新高潮，为提前在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，以辉煌的成就迎接伟大的国庆十周年的欢腾气氛中召开的。在这光辉的十年里，我国各族人民，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，以高山低头，河水让路的英雄气魄，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的空前的伟大的胜利。
    我国体育事业，由于坚决执行了党中央和毛主席关于开展群众性体育运动、为生产和国防服务的方针，十年来也取得了巨大的成就。特别是从1958年以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国人民大跃进、人民公社化、全民皆兵运动的鼓舞和推动下，无论是群众体育的普及，或是运动技术水平的提高，都获得了飞跃的发展和显著的成绩。这对于保证和配合生产、工作、学习任务的完成，起了十分有益的积极作用。现在全国有成亿的人经常参加体育活动。广播体操已成为广大人民日常生活的一部分。在保卫祖国安全的全民皆兵运动中，打枪习武已成为千百万人的爱好，并且涌现了许多优秀的射手。成批的人通过了劳卫制和等级运动员标准。
    在广泛的群众体育运动中，涌现了无数的优秀运动员，技术水平也提高很快。解放后，我国运动员创造和打破了两千八百多次全国纪录，出现了一个世界冠军。这是中国历史上从来没有过的。1956年和1957年只有三人六次打破三项世界纪录，而在大跃进的1958年就有九人八次创造六项世界纪录，增长了一倍多。在继续跃进的1959年，仅1—8月，就有二十九人在十二个项目中打破了十二次世界纪录，又使我国技术水平大大地前进了一步。
    我国体育运动所以得到迅速发展，是和全国人民建设社会主义的积极热情分不开的，也是和全民大跃进分不开的。不可设想，没有人民精神面貌的改变，没有生产的发展和物质生活的提高，人民的体育运动会出现这样好的局面。这一切说明，我国广大劳动人民在中国共产党的领导下，不仅在政治上彻底翻了身，经济生活得到了提高和改善，在体质上也有了显著的增强。
    我国体育事业取得的巨大成就，是由于党和毛主席，以及人民政府对体育运动的一贯重视和正确领导，对劳动人民身体健康的无限关怀的结果。中华人民共和国成立后，党和国家把体育运动列为社会主义建设事业的重要组成部分。毛主席关于“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的指示，党中央关于“改善人民健康状况，增强人民体质，是党的一项重要政治任务”，是“向劳动人民进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一”的指示，为我国体育运动指出了明确的方向，开辟了广阔的道路。党和国家还为体育运动的开展，创造了充分的物质条件。如在培养干部方面，各省、市、自治区都普遍建立了体育学院或体育学校，青少年业余体育学校也获得了蓬勃的发展；各地还兴建了许多体育场和体育馆，这是群众进行体育锻炼和提高运动技术水平的重要基地。
    在今后工作中，必须坚决执行体育运动为生产和国防服务的方针。加强党的领导，政治挂帅，反对右倾思想，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜，继续贯彻普及与提高相结合的原则。学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验。普及群众体育运动，增强人民体质，加速提高运动技术水平，不断创造新纪录，特别是提高主要运动项目的成绩。把我国的体育运动推向一个更加普遍、深入发展的新阶段。
    为了庆祝建国十周年举行的这届全国运动会，它的规模在我国还是空前的，包括四十二个比赛和表演项目。在大会的准备过程中，受到党中央和各级党委的亲切关怀，受到广大人民的热烈支持。参加这次运动会的，包括各民族的一万多名运动员，他们是从基层、县、市、省层层选拔出来的。全国共有五千多万工人、农民、学生、干部和部队官兵参加了这次大会的选拔，形成了一个参加体育活动的高潮，并多次创造了省、市、自治区纪录、全国纪录和世界纪录，充分体现了体育工作普及与提高相结合的方针。这次运动会不仅将检阅我国体育运动十年来所取得的成就，也是表现我国人民力争上游的共产主义风格的比武场。运动会的目的，是要团结全国体育工作者，推动群众体育运动的发展，和在若干运动项目上创造优异成绩。希望大会全体同志遵照党中央的指示，政治挂帅，鼓足干劲，力争上游，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格和优良道德作风。同心同德，团结一致，认真负责，虚心学习。胜不骄，败不馁，以中国人民在大跃进时代的英雄气魄，千方百计地创造优异成绩，把全运会开得好，开得精彩！
    庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年！
    总路线万岁！
    大跃进万岁！
    人民公社万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！（附图片）
