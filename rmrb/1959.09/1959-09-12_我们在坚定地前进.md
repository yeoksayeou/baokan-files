We are Firmly Moving Forward
Wèi Wēi

After the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee were published, they aroused the smug ridicule of imperialist elements. In my opinion, their faces and tones are very similar to those of a group of bankrupt rogues cursing a family with a prosperous business.

One said: "Humph, this family! They originally said they would add four horses, but what now? They only added two!"

"What kind of horses are those two? Look at all the mixed colors!" said another.

"Even those were scraped together!" said a third. "Look how tight their days are, they can't even breathe."

"They even said they wanted to buy one! Haha, just watch!" said a fourth. "I guarantee they can't do it!"

Then, they all grinned with joy. As if, suddenly, their dreary days had improved, as if their panicked and empty hearts had found great comfort.

This is their portrait.

However, we would like to ask them a question while they are feeling smug. Yes, we only added two horses. Whether they are good horses, bad horses, old horses, foals, horses with scars, or horses with mixed colors, they are still two horses added. May I ask you, how many horses did you add to your family? Oh, none! Not even one! On the contrary, you reduced them! What's going on? Why don't you talk about these things? Is there something not so wonderful hidden inside, something that would be embarrassing for you to talk about?

This is a real damper!

Gentlemen! You can slander and defame us as much as you like. If you can only alleviate your own anxiety and fill the emptiness in your hearts by cursing others, then it shows how meaningless your lives have become! For the Chinese people, your words and your slanders are not only harmless, but often very beneficial. Because the Chinese people have long had this experience: whatever the imperialists hate as a so-called bad thing, it must be a good thing; whatever they like as a good thing, it must be a bad thing. Look how fiercely they attack the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, their eyes are all red. This precisely prompts our people to be alert and thoughtful, and to further recognize how important and precious the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are to us!

The General Line is by no means a simple thing. A party that cannot deeply understand and fully reflect the Chinese people's desire to quickly get rid of "poverty and blankness" could not propose such a line. A party that does not have enough vigor and heroism could not propose such a line. At the same time, the emergence of this line is not as easy as beckoning; it is a Marxist-Leninist summary after several years of socialist construction practice, referring to the historical experience of other advanced countries, and after multi-faceted exploration. The people of a country who want revolution and liberation must find the most suitable and correct path for themselves. Socialist construction is also the same. Without the correct road, it is like a torrent rushing and surging in the valleys, but unable to flow down magnificently. Looking back, in the 1930s of the Chinese revolution, the night was dark and boundless, and there was originally no road. Was it not because of Comrade Mao Zedong's genius, his great strategic thought of combining armed struggle, land revolution, and base areas, that the Chinese revolution found its road, stood firm, developed, and achieved the great victory of the Chinese people? Today, in the new period of socialist construction, in the vast wilderness of "poverty and blankness," how much we need a road, a road that is the closest, most direct, and best, a road that can get rid of poverty and backwardness in the fastest way. It was our Comrade Mao Zedong again who, in a not very long time, with his bright eyes, discovered the shortcut for the Chinese people's great socialist advance. This is the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." It is precisely this line that can unlock the extremely profound and great creativity hidden in the Chinese people, can fully utilize the superiority of our advanced system, the superiority of our country's population and geographical conditions, and can make our motherland strong and prosperous in a relatively short period of time. It is also precisely this line that can more quickly enhance the power of the socialist camp and suppress the outbreak of new wars as much as possible. This is a line that has a huge impact on the fate of our people and the fate of the people of the world. This is a complete line that combines great revolutionary spirit and scientific spirit. We have such a line, which the whole Party and the people of the whole country deeply feel fortunate for!

The Great Leap Forward is the glorious practice of the General Line. It is the result of the General Line being grasped by millions of revolutionary masses. To be more precise, the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the first half of this year was just a preliminary test of the sharpness of the General Line. All friends will see that the Five-Year Plan can be completed in two years. What a great victory, what a brilliant achievement! Moreover, we have not only risen like a resounding arrow in the economy, shaking the world, but also trained the people, trained the cadres, and greatly enriched our experience in socialist construction. This is a guarantee for a series of leaps forward and a series of victories in the future. Some people even say that the Great Leap Forward is a "petty-bourgeois frenzy." We can't help but ask, is completing the Five-Year Plan in two years called "petty-bourgeois frenzy?" Is completing it in five and a half or six years proletarian calmness? Petty-bourgeois frenzy is certainly not good, but don't forget that the proletariat is always an attacking class full of energy. Only those who have fallen into the quagmire of right-leaning will be dazzled and say such completely wrong things. Holding this right-leaning view, of course they will only see shortcomings and turn a blind eye to great achievements. We should shout loudly at them: do you want to deny the achievements? Then please first erase all the factories, reservoirs, hospitals, schools, and thousands of new things, large and small, that have emerged from the sweat of the masses since the Great Leap Forward from this land of China. Otherwise, please bow your heads and admit defeat. As for the shortcomings that accompany the great achievements, they should naturally be taken seriously and resolutely corrected. In fact, they have already been corrected, or are continuing to be corrected. However, if anyone believes that there should not be this or that shortcoming in the mass movement, that is just the fantasy of a scholar sitting in a house, or a master standing above the masses. Things always move forward in twists and turns. A revolution as small and exquisite as an ivory carving does not exist on this planet. If a earth-shattering struggle involving millions of people does not have any shortcomings at all, that would be a real strange thing. Shortcomings not only exist this year, but will also exist next year. They will exist every year, every season, and every moment. The shortcomings of this year are overcome and transformed into favorable factors for our cause, but next year there will be new situations, and new situations will produce new shortcomings. Our economic construction, like fighting wars in the past, requires us to hold review meetings after each battle, and each review meeting will find shortcomings. Overcoming these shortcomings will enable us to win new battles. This is how we move forward firmly without any complaints!

The People's Commune is a great creation of the Chinese people and the Chinese Party. There is a poem that says: "I searched for him thousands of times in the crowd, then suddenly turning back, I found him where the lanterns were dimly lit." Yes, it is with such joy that we see our Party discovering and affirming this brand-new form of life, a form that accelerates the socialist construction of the countryside, and is the best organizational form for the future transition from socialism to communism under the conditions of our country, in the revolutionary upsurge of 1958. This cannot but be said to be a major contribution of the Chinese Party and the Chinese people to human life. Precisely because of this, we regard her as the rising sun, while the enemy regards her as a particularly intolerable monster. The enemy particularly hates her, hates her, so we must love her even more, protect her, support her with full enthusiasm, and wholeheartedly consolidate and develop her, so that she can move towards an increasingly perfect state, and emit the brightest and most beautiful brilliance in the East of Asia!

After reading the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party, I feel more and more bright in my heart and full of confidence. We must hold high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune and move forward firmly. We must use a new upsurge of production to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and use it to answer the enemy's shameless curses. We warn all imperialist elements: your attempt to use our opportunity to adjust production targets and verify output to depress the fighting spirit of the Chinese people is just a waste of effort. Our adjustment of production targets is just as common as the adjustment of combat deployment we made when we wiped out your invading troops on the Korean battlefield in the past. Our verification of output precisely shows a proletarian party's high sense of responsibility to the interests of the people and its open and honest mind. Such a mind and such a demeanor are something that your parties, which exude the stench of decline, can never achieve. An old and bankrupt British imperialist newspaper, after gleefully cursing for a while, comforted itself by saying: "We can breathe a sigh of relief, and we don't have to worry about the threat of that giant dragon for the time being." We say, whether you worry or not is your own business. In the past, the "giant dragon" did not want you to worry, but you were scared to death yourself. Now you want to breathe a sigh of relief, that's up to you, let's wait and see! However, it must be told in advance: when you suddenly find one day that you dare not breathe again, don't complain about that "Oriental giant dragon" that is galloping endlessly!

    我们在坚定地前进
    魏巍
    八中全会的文件公布以后，引起了帝国主义分子得意忘形的嘲骂。在我看，其嘴脸、口吻，极似一群破落户无赖，对一个家业兴旺人家的诅咒。
    一个说：“哼，这一家人！原先说要添四匹马的，现在怎样？也不过只添了两匹！”
    “两匹什么马呀，你瞧有多少杂毛！”另一个说。
    “就那也是刮牙齿凑的！”第三个说。“你瞧那日子紧得连气都喘不过来了。”
    “他们还说要买一匹哩！哈哈，你瞧着吧！……”第四个说，“我保证他办不到！”
    于是，他们皆大欢喜地咧着嘴笑了起来。仿佛忽然之间，他们灰溜溜的日子好过了些，仿佛他们惶乱空虚的心头得到了莫大的安慰。
    这就是他们的肖像。
    可是，我们倒愿在他们得意之余动问一下。是的，我们只添了两匹马。尽管是良马也罢，劣马也罢，老马也罢，马驹也罢，带疤、带杂毛的马也罢，但毕竟是添了两匹。请问阁下，你家里添了几匹？哦，没有！一匹也没有！反倒减少了！这是怎末回事？为什么不讲讲这些呢？难道这里面隐藏着什么不太美妙的东西，讲出来让你们丢脸吗？
    这真是大煞风景的问题！
    老爷们！随你们毁谤、中伤就是。如果你们只有靠诅咒别人才能减轻自己的不安，才能弥补心头的空虚，那就说明你们的日子已经没有意思到什么程度！对中国人来说，你们的话，你们的诽谤，不仅无损，而且常常是大有好处。因为中国人早就有这样一条经验：凡帝国主义痛恨的所谓坏事，那必定就是好事；凡他们喜欢的好事，那一定就是坏事。瞧他们对总路线，对大跃进，对人民公社攻得多凶呀，眼都红了，这正好促使我们的人惊觉和沉思，进一步认识到总路线、大跃进和人民公社对于我们是多末重要，多末珍贵！
    总路线决不是一项简单的事物。一个党，如果不能深刻体察与充分反映中国人民迅速摆脱“一穷二白”的渴望，他就不可能提出这样的路线。一个党，如果不具有足够的朝气和英雄气概，他也不可能提出这样的路线。同时，这条路线的产生，也不像招手而至那般轻易；它是经过几年来社会主义建设的实践，参照其它先进国家的历史经验，经过多方探索的马克思列宁主义的总结。一个国家的人民要革命，要解放，就必须找出最适合自己的最正确的道路。社会主义建设也是这样。没有正确的道路，就好比洪涛冲撞激荡在山谷间，却不能浩浩荡荡奔泻而下。回想，中国革命的三十年代，黑夜茫茫，路原来是没有的。难道不是由于毛泽东同志的天才，他那武装斗争、土地革命和根据地三者结合的伟大战略思想，才使中国革命找到了道路，站定了脚根，得到了发展，并取得了中国人民伟大的胜利吗？今天，在新的社会主义建设时期，在“一穷二白”的漫漫莽野中，我们又是多末需要有一条路，一条最近、最直、最好的路，能够最快地摆脱贫穷落后境况的路。又是我们的毛泽东同志，在并不很长的时间内，以他明亮的目光，发现了中国人民社会主义大进军的捷径。这就是党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线。正是这条路线，才能揭开蕴藏在中国人民中的极其深厚伟大的创造力，才能充分发挥我们先进制度的优越性，我国人口、地理条件的优越性，才能在比较短的时间内，使我们的祖国变得强大繁荣起来。也正是这条路线，才能更快地增强社会主义阵营的威力，尽可能抑制新战争的爆发。这是对我国人民命运以及世界人民命运具有巨大影响的路线。这是伟大的革命气概和科学精神相结合的完整的路线。我们有了这样一条路线，这是全党和全国人民深深感到庆幸的！
    大跃进，是总路线的光辉实践。是总路线被千百万革命群众掌握了的结果。更确切地说，1958年和今年上半年的大跃进，只不过是总路线的霜锋初试。一切朋友都会看到，五年计划，两年就可完成，这是多末大的胜仗，多末光辉灿烂的成就！而且，我们不只在经济上有如响箭一般的上升，震动了世界；同时也锻炼了人民，锻炼了干部，极大地丰富了自己社会主义建设的经验。这是今后一连串跃进，一连串胜利的保证。有人竟说，大跃进是“小资产阶级的狂热性运动”，我们不禁想问，五年计划，两年完成，叫做“小资产阶级的狂热”，难道五年半、六年完成才是无产阶级式的冷静吗？小资产阶级的狂热当然不好，但是不要忘记，无产阶级却永远是一个干劲冲天的进攻的阶级。只有自己跌在右倾的泥坑里，才会看花了眼，才会讲出这样十分错误的话。抱着这种右倾观点，当然他们就只会看到缺点，对伟大的成绩视而不见。我们应该向他们大喊一声：你们要否定成绩吗？那就首先请你们把大跃进以来从群众汗水中涌现的一切大小工厂、大小水库、大小医院、大小学校以及万千的新生事物从中国这块大地上抹掉。否则，就请你们低头认输。至于伴随着伟大成绩所出现的缺点，自然应当严肃正视，坚决纠正。事实上已经纠正了，或继续纠正着。但是，如果有谁认为，群众运动中不应当出现这样那样的缺点，那不过是坐在房子里的书生的幻想，或站在群众之上的老爷。事物总是在迂回曲折地前进，如同象牙雕刻那样巧小玲珑的革命，在这个星球上是不存在的。假若千百万群众参加的翻天覆地的斗争，竟然没有一点缺点，那才是真正的怪事。缺点，不仅今年有，明年还会有。会年年有，季季有，时时有。今年的缺点被克服了，化作了我们事业的有利因素，但是明年又有新的情况，新情况又会产生新的缺点。我们的经济建设，也如同过去打仗一样，每次战斗下来，都要开检讨会，每次检讨会都会检查出缺点来，而克服了这些缺点，就又使我们获得了新的战斗的胜利。我们就是这样毫不埋怨地坚定地行进！
    人民公社，这是中国人民和中国党的伟大创造。有一首词说：“众里寻他千百度，蓦回头，那人却在灯火阑珊处。”是的，我们就是怀着这样的欢欣，看到我们的党在1958年的革命高潮中发现并肯定了这一崭新的生活形式，加速农村社会主义建设的形式，并且是在我国条件下将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好的组织形式。这不能不说是中国党和中国人民对人类生活的一项重大贡献。正因为如此，所以我们把她看做是初升的太阳，而敌人却把她看做是特别不能容忍的怪物。敌人特别讨厌她，痛恨她，我们就要加倍爱她，保护她，用满腔热情来扶助她，全心全意地来巩固她和发展她，使她走向日益完美的境地，在亚洲东方发出最明亮最美丽的光彩！
    读过了党的八中全会的决议，越发感到心底明亮，信心百倍。我们一定要更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗坚定地前进。我们要用新的生产高潮，来响应党中央的号召，并用来回答敌人无耻的诅咒。我们警告一切帝国主义分子：你们利用我们调整生产指标、核实产量的机会来沮丧中国人民斗志的企图，只是徒费心机。我们调整生产指标，正如同过去在朝鲜战场上歼灭你们的侵略军队时所作的调整战斗部署一样的平常。我们核实产量，却正好表现了一个无产阶级政党对人民利益的高度责任感和光明磊落的胸怀。这样的胸怀，这样的风度，是你们发散着没落臭味的什么什么党派，永远也做不到的。英帝国主义——这个老破落户——的一家报纸，兴高采烈地咒骂了一通之后，自我安慰地说：“我们可以喘一喘气，暂时可以不必担心那条巨龙的威胁了。”我们说，担心不担心，这是你自己的事。过去，“巨龙”并没有要你担心，是你自己怕得要命。现在你要喘气，那也由你，咱们就走着瞧吧！但是，务必事先奉告：当你有一天忽然发现又不敢喘气的时候，你不要埋怨那条奔腾不息的“东方巨龙”！　1959年9月9日
