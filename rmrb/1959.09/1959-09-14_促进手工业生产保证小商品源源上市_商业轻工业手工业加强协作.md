Xinhua News Agency report: In recent months, commercial departments, light industry, and handicraft departments in various regions have closely cooperated and mutually supported each other in restoring and developing handicraft production, greatly promoting handicraft production and ensuring a steady supply of small commodities to the market.

    Commercial departments in various regions have opened up sources of raw materials for handicrafts through going to the mountains and countryside, clearing warehouses, and purchasing waste products. Light industry and handicraft departments have also actively produced and provided more products to supply the market. In order to support handicrafts in increasing the production of daily necessities, the commercial departments of Wuhan organized hundreds of people to go to the streets and lanes to recycle waste materials. In June, a total of 1,939 tons were recycled, an increase of 75.3% compared with the same period last year. In July, it surged to 3,332 tons, an increase of 72% compared with June, including 274 tons of non-ferrous metals such as waste copper, tin, lead, and aluminum, 1,450 tons of ferrous metals, and a large amount of waste cloth, waste hemp, waste rubber, broken glass, etc. After sorting, these waste materials were successively distributed to more than 60 production units in Wuhan as raw materials. Since the second quarter, wholesale stations and shops of department stores, cultural supplies, hardware, transportation and electrical equipment in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province have supplied more than 1,620 tons of Mao bamboo, steel, etc. to production departments. The Shanghai Timber Supply Company increased its supply to small commodity production departments in the third quarter. In early August, it supplied more than 6,000 cubic meters of timber needed for handicraft production. This batch of materials can produce more than 100,000 washboards, more than 400,000 pairs of wooden slippers, 10,000 pot lids, and a large number of miscellaneous items.

    In many regions, industry and commerce departments have also held industry-commerce collaboration meetings to connect production and sales plans, rationally adjust purchase prices, sign production and sales contracts, and closely integrate production and sales relationships. Mutual support and joint leaps forward between industry and commerce have become a common practice.

    Light industry and handicraft departments in various regions are working hard to tap the potential of raw materials, increase product varieties, improve product quality, and reduce costs. The industrial department of Guilin, Guangxi, took the initiative to send the historical situation of handicraft production and commodity catalogs to the commercial department for reference in ordering goods, and sent people to visit various stores to solicit opinions and implement guaranteed repairs and replacements for substandard products, which the commercial department was very satisfied with. The Victory Hardware Factory in Hengyang, Hunan Province, often seeks the opinions of the commercial department on products and increases the specifications and varieties of products.

    促进手工业生产保证小商品源源上市
    商业轻工业手工业加强协作
    据新华社讯　最近几个月来，各地商业部门、轻工业和手工业部门，在恢复和发展手工业生产中，密切协作，互相支援，大大地促进了手工业生产，保证了小商品源源上市。
    各地商业部门通过上山下乡、清理仓库、收购废品等方式，为手工业开辟原料材料来源。轻工业、手工业部门也积极生产，提供更多的产品供应市场。武汉市各区商业部门为了支援手工业增产日用品，组织了成百上千的人员，到街道里巷去回收废旧物资，6月份共回收了一千九百三十九吨，比去年同期增加75.3％，7月份又激增到三千三百三十二吨，比6月份增加72％；其中有废铜、锡、铅、铝等有色金属二百七十四吨，黑色金属一千四百五十吨，还有大量的破布、废麻、废橡胶、碎玻璃等。这些废旧物资经过整理，陆续分配给武汉市的六十多个生产单位作为原料材料。浙江杭州市的百货、文化用品、五金、交通电工器材等批发站和商店，从第二季度以来已供应了生产部门毛竹、钢铁等一千六百二十余吨。上海市木材供应公司在第三季度增加了对小商品生产部门的供应量，8月上旬就供应了手工业生产所需木材六千多立方米；用这批料，能够生产出十万多块洗衣板、四十多万双木拖鞋、一万只锅盖和大批零星用品。
    许多地区的工商部门还召开工商协作会议，衔接产销计划，合理调整收购价格，签订产销合同，密切产销关系。工商之间互相支援，共同跃进，已成风气。
    各地轻工业、手工业部门都努力地挖掘原材料潜力，增加产品品种，改进产品质量，降低成本。广西桂林市工业部门主动将手工业生产的历史情况和商品目录送给商业部门作要货参考，又派人访问各商店，征求意见，对次品实行包修包换，商业部门很满意。湖南衡阳市胜利五金厂经常征求商业部门对产品的意见，增加产品的规格品种。
