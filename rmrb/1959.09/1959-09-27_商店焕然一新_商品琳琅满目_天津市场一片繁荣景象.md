Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 25th: The Tianjin market is showing a scene of pre-holiday prosperity.

From the bustling Binjiang Road to the edge of the city, the windows and shelves of the stores are filled with colorful goods. Store employees are busy arranging window displays and adding merchandise. The variety of daily necessities in the city has increased by more than 6,000 types compared to the past, and cotton cloth and wool fabrics have increased by more than 600 types compared to April. There are more than 500 types of leather shoes. Sewing workers have rushed to produce thousands of new outfits. Drums, colorful silks, cosmetics, and recreational supplies needed for the festival are also being put on the market in a steady stream.

The employees of the commercial departments regard doing a good job in supply and service, so that the citizens can joyfully and happily celebrate the National Day, as a gift to the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the country. As early as April and May, department stores, textile companies, and other companies established specialized institutions. On the one hand, they sent people to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and other places to purchase goods, and on the other hand, they assisted local factories in increasing production and organizing the supply of goods. Department stores have also purchased a large number of distinctive goods from other places, including Suzhou's flutes, Dalian's brass instruments, Shanghai's plastic playing cards, and Hangzhou's handkerchiefs. Non-staple foods such as fruits, meat, aquatic products, and vegetables are being transported in a steady stream. The quantity of goods stored for the National Day supply is much larger than the actual sales volume in the same period last year.

Employees in the service industries are working hard to improve the quality of service to celebrate the National Day. The catering industry has increased the variety of dishes and prepared various fruit wines and white wines. During the festival, more than 150 restaurants throughout the city will be open day and night. Industries such as hairdressing, bathhouses, and laundry services have been busy in recent days. The women's sections of barber shops are almost always full. Laundry shops send people to pick up and deliver goods to customers' homes, and all clothing that customers wear for the festival is processed in advance with priority. All barber shops, bathhouses, and laundry shops in the city will extend their business hours for five days before the National Day to facilitate customers. The photography industry will set up mobile photo stations in public places such as parks and cultural palaces during the festival.
