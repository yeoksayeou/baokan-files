　　Studying the Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and Launching a Recall-Contrast Education Movement
　　Xinmin Commune Musters Full Energy to Continue the Great Leap Forward

　　(Our dispatch) Xinmin People's Commune in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, while studying the resolutions and communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, organized all its members to carry out an education movement of "recalling the past, comparing the present, and looking forward to the future" in conjunction with celebrating the 10th anniversary of the National Day. The broad masses of commune members summarized the tremendous changes in production and life over the past ten years, further recognized the superiority of the People's Commune, and thus mustered even greater energy, laying a solid ideological foundation for the continued Great Leap Forward.

　　After the people's commune was established, the peasants of Xinmin Commune were jubilant. The tremendous superiority of the People's Commune in the past year is truly inexhaustible. Moreover, the changes over the past decade have been enormous. Therefore, systematically recalling the road we have traveled in the past will greatly benefit the improvement of commune members' awareness. The Xinmin Commune Party Committee decided to organize commune members to conduct recall and comparison in the form of "telling stories and chatting about family affairs" during breaks in busy agricultural production. In the recall and comparison, many people first expressed their feelings from the changes in production. Commune member Gong Zizhen said that before liberation, our poor peasants rented land from landlords. With little capital and labor, it was good to harvest four or five hundred catties of grain per mu. After the land reform, cooperativization was realized, and it was even more different after the people's commune was established. We combined the scattered "bean curd residue" land into large tracts of machine-cultivated land, unified the commune's irrigation system, and built more than 700 control gates, truly achieving "freedom from drought and flood." Today, it is no longer a rare thing to harvest a thousand catties of grain. Commune members have a deep understanding of the Great Leap Forward after communization. Shi Liangcheng, a well-known production expert in Xinmin Commune, said, "I am not an amateur in production. Before liberation, the yield of the land I cultivated was among the best in the village, but I have never felt as comfortable as I do now." At that time, a broken plow and a few loads of manure were my only production capital. When the rainfall was not regulated, I could only stare at the sky helplessly. Since cooperativization, especially since the people's commune, our road has become wider and wider, production has become better and better, and yields have become higher and higher. This year, the commune suffered from a rare flood. If it had been before liberation, I don't know how many people would have gone bankrupt. But this year, with the People's Commune, there are many people and great strength. We organized more than 3,000 people to build dikes and prevent floods at one time, ensuring a bumper harvest. At this point, commune member Chen Mengting couldn't help but say: "The People's Commune is really powerful." Last year, we vigorously developed steel production, and the entire commune withdrew more than 1,000 people. At that time, I was still worried that the departure of so many people would affect the commune's production. Who knew that it was just the opposite? This year, in March, when I returned from the mountain, not only had all the commune's wheat been sown, but it had also expanded from 1,800 mu last year to more than 3,500 mu, and the total output increased from more than 600,000 catties last year to 1.28 million catties this year. In short, everyone agreed that the People's Commune and the Great Leap Forward were the right things to do. Now, the commune can truly be said to be "a good harvest of grains and thriving industries."

　　Talking about the changes in life over the past decade, everyone was all smiles. Commune member Zeng Jianming said: "As the saying goes, if there is output in the field, life will be better." He said that since liberation, thanks to the leadership of the Party, life has become more and more prosperous. This year, I live in the new building built by the commune, my family bought a thermos, all seven members of my family have new clothes, and five children, except for one who is breastfeeding, two are in kindergarten and two are in elementary school. My family doesn't worry about food or clothing. Thinking back to the thatched hut I lived in before liberation, I had to move the bed around with my wife whenever it rained. Every year, we would have a month or two without food. After the establishment of the cooperative, life was a little better, but because there were many people and little labor, life was still not good, and we could not concentrate on production. Now, with the establishment of the People's Commune, with public canteens and nurseries, all problems have been solved at once. Looking back on the past and comparing it to the present, it is truly a hell and a paradise. His words touched the heart of Grandpa Wang Shiquan. This eighty-three-year-old man had been helping people with odd jobs before liberation and had never had a good day. This year, he moved into the new building built by the commune. He said: "Jiang Taigong met King Wen at eighty-three, and I, an old man, live in a building at eighty-three. It's all red in old age." He repeatedly said that this was all thanks to the Communist Party and the communization. This old man, who should have been enjoying his old age, has been working even harder since communization. He often rushes to do work, either tidying up flowers in the garden or weeding seedlings in the vegetable field.

　　Women have particularly deep feelings about the benefits of communization. Wen Yuqing, the mother of five children, said that in the past, no one took care of the children, and it was not easy to work. I had one in my arms and one at my heels. After the establishment of the commune, we eat in the public canteen and send the children to the nursery, which is truly a liberation.

　　When talking about this year's production and life, everyone was even more delighted. At this time, commune director Luo Shifa reported the following series of figures: the total output of more than 3,000 mu of wheat in the commune increased by nearly doubled on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward; the average yield per unit area of rapeseed increased by 10%. The 1,500 mu of early rice in the commune has achieved a large-scale increase in production, with a high yield of 1,150 catties per mu, and a general yield of 700 to 800 catties per mu. The 17,000 mu of mid-season rice in the commune has also started harvesting, with long ears and many grains, which is an auspicious sign of a bumper harvest. In less than a year, the number of pigs raised in the commune increased from 7,200 to 8,500; the income from multiple economies increased by about double compared with last year. The commune has successively established 91 public canteens, more than 300 nurseries, kindergartens, and breastfeeding stations. He said that in the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party, we have overcome all difficulties and achieved a prosperous situation that has never been seen before.

　　Combining the memories of the road traveled over the past ten years, the commune members conducted a specific analysis of the current rural situation and the favorable conditions of communization. They unanimously believed that the current situation is very good, and they are full of confidence in the Great Leap Forward in production this winter and next spring, and everyone is full of energy. They said that with the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward and the general line, we will overcome any difficulty, no matter how great it is. Now, all 91 production teams in the commune have revised their production plans. In addition to strengthening the autumn harvest, striving for careful harvesting and returning every grain to the family, they must also seize the recent period to complete the late autumn crop planting plan, expanding the late autumn crop area from 4,600 mu last year to more than 5,300 mu, so as to achieve more planting and more harvesting. Recently, the commune has added three new tractors and decided to expand the commune's mechanized farming area by more than double. In order to give greater play to the superiority of the commune's collective management, the entire commune is also uniformly planning and rationally using land to help production teams with poor economic foundations develop production. At the same time, the commune's kindergartens and bathhouses are also under construction. (Fan Sui, Wen Chuanxing)

    学习八中全会决议开展回忆对比教育运动
    新民公社鼓足干劲继续跃进
    本报讯　四川省新繁县新民人民公社，在学习党的八届八中全会决议和公报时，组织全体社员结合庆祝国庆十周年，开展“回忆过去，对比现在，瞻望将来”的教育运动。广大社员总结了十年来在生产、生活上的巨大变化，进一步认识到人民公社的优越性，从而更加鼓足干劲，为继续跃进打下了巩固的思想基础。
    人民公社化以后，新民公社的农民欢欣鼓舞。一年来，人民公社发挥的巨大优越性，真是说不完来道不尽。而且十年来的变化巨大。因此，系统地回忆一下过去走过的道路，将对社员觉悟的提高有很大好处。新民公社党委决定在繁忙的农事生产中，利用休息时间，用“摆龙门阵、谈家常”的方式，组织社员进行回忆对比。在回忆对比中，许多人首先从生产上的变化，发表了自己的感想。社员龚自珍说，解放前，我们贫苦农民都是向地主租地，本钱短，劳力少，每亩地收到四、五百斤谷子就不错了。土地改革后，实现了合作化，特别是人民公社化后就更不同了。我们把分散的“豆脑干”地并成大块的机耕地，统一了全社的灌溉系统，修了七百多座控制闸，真正做到“水旱从人”。今天要收千把斤粮食，已不是什么稀罕事了。社员们对公社化后生产大跃进体会很深刻。新民社的著名生产能手史良成说，我对生产不是外行，解放前我种的地产量在全村就是数一数二，可是我心里从没有像现在这样舒畅过。那时，一把破犁，几挑粪水，就是我唯一的生产本钱了。遇到雨水不调，只好对天瞪眼。自从合作化特别是人民公社化以来，我们的路越走越宽，生产越来越好，产量越来越高。今年公社遭到罕有的洪水袭击，如果在解放前不知有多少人要遭到破产。但是，今年有了人民公社，人多力量大，一次就组织了三千多人筑堤防洪，保住了丰收。说到这里，社员陈梦亭禁不住开腔了，他说：人民公社硬是力量大。去年大搞钢铁，全公社抽走一千多人，当时我还耽心，人走多了会影响社里生产。谁知恰恰相反，今年3月，我从山上回来，全社小麦不仅全部播完，并且从去年的一千八百亩扩大到三千五百多亩，总产量由去年的六十多万斤增加到今年的一百二十八万斤。总之，大家一致认为人民公社、大跃进是搞对了。现在，公社真可说是：“五谷丰登、百业兴旺”。
    谈到十年来的生活变化，大家都喜笑颜开。社员曾建明说：俗语说得好，田头有得出，日子才好过。他说，解放以来，靠了党的领导，日子越过越富裕。今年，我住在公社新盖的大楼里，家里买了暖水瓶，一家七口都添了新衣服，五个娃娃，除了一个吃奶外，两个上幼儿园，两个读小学。一家子不愁吃、不愁穿。回想解放前，我住的那间破草房，遇到下雨我就和老婆抬着床打转转。每年总要有个把月断顿。建立合作社后，生活虽然好了一些，可是因为人多劳力少，日子仍旧不好过，不能安心生产。现在，成立了人民公社，有了公共食堂、托儿所，什么问题都一下子解决了。回想过去，对比现在，真是一个地狱，一个天堂。他的话触动了王世全大爷的心思，这位八十三岁的老人家，解放前一直帮人打短工，没过过一天好日子，今年他搬进了公社新建的大楼。他说：姜太公八十三遇文王，我老汉八十三住楼房，都是老来红。他连声说，这全托共产党的福，全托公社化的福。这位本该养老的老人，公社化后干活更起劲了，他经常抢活干，不是在花园里整理花卉，就是在菜田边除苗拔草。
    对公社化的好处，妇女们的感受尤其深刻。五个孩子的妈妈温玉清说，以前娃娃没人照顾，劳动时好不顺心，手上抱一个，脚后跟一个。建立公社后，吃饭到公共食堂，娃娃送托儿所，这下可真解放了。
    谈到今年的生产、生活面貌时，大家更是喜笑颜开。这时，社长罗世发报告了以下一连串的数字：全社三千多亩小麦总产量在去年大跃进的基础上净增近一倍；油菜籽单位面积产量平均提高了10％。全社一千五百亩早稻已获得大面积增产，产量高的亩产达一千一百五十斤，一般亩产也在七、八百斤。全社一万七千多亩中稻也已开镰，穗长粒多，是个大丰收的吉兆。不到一年，全社生猪由七千二百头增加到八千五百头；多种经济的收入比去年增加了一倍左右。全社先后建立了九十一个公共食堂、三百多个托儿所、幼儿园和哺乳站。他说，十年来，我们在党的领导下，克服了一切困难，出现了从来没有像现在这样蒸蒸日上的繁荣局面。
    社员们结合回忆十年所走过的道路，对目前农村形势和公社化的有利条件进行了具体分析，一致认为，目前形势好得很，对今冬明春的生产大跃进充满了信心，个个干劲十足。他们说，有了去年大跃进的经验，有了总路线，天大的困难也要把它拿下来。现在，全社九十一个生产队，都重新修订了生产计划，除了加强秋收工作，做到精打细打，颗粒还家外，还要抓紧最近一个时期，突击完成晚秋作物增种计划，把晚秋作物面积由去年的四千六百亩，扩大到五千三百多亩，达到多种多收。最近，公社又新添了三台拖拉机，决定要把全社机耕面积扩大一倍以上。为了更加发挥公社集体经营的优越性，全社还正在统一规划，合理使用土地，帮助经济基础较差的生产队发展生产。同时，公社幼儿园、澡堂也正在动工兴修。　（范眭、文传兴）
