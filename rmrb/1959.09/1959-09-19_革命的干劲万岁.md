    Long Live Revolutionary Drive!
    Guan Feng
    Right opportunists slander our Great Leap Forward as a "petty-bourgeois fanatic movement." This vicious remark also reveals a truth from the opposite perspective: the reason we were able to achieve the Great Leap Forward and obtain tremendous achievements is because, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, the people of the whole country became enthusiastic. This enthusiasm is not some "petty-bourgeois fanaticism," but a revolutionary fervor for the cause of socialism, a desire to rapidly change the state of "poverty and blankness" and build our country into a great socialist nation. This high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm has transformed into a soaring drive, so that "rivers must make way" and "mountains must bow their heads," so that the main targets of our Second Five-Year Plan can potentially be completed within two years. Without such revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary drive, it will not work. Without revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary drive, even the best plans cannot be realized. The curses of right opportunists also prove from the opposite perspective that we are doing the right thing, that the enthusiasm is good, and that the drive is a thousand times correct, ten thousand times correct. We must raise our revolutionary enthusiasm higher and higher, and drum up our drive again and again.
    The higher the revolutionary enthusiasm, the better, and the greater the revolutionary drive, the better. Can there be excess in this? No. It is true that we advocate both enthusiasm and coolness. However, this does not mean that we should be half-hearted about the cause of socialism, or be hot and cold; but that the heart should be hot and the head should be cool—that is, to conduct a calm and scientific analysis. That is to say, we must combine revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary drive with calm and scientific analysis, in order to exert our strength where it is most effective and strive for the greatest results. At certain times, it is necessary to emphasize calm scientific analysis more. But generally speaking, revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary drive are more important. It is the dominant aspect. Because revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary drive are the preconditions for calm scientific analysis; a cold heart and no drive make scientific analysis impossible. Without revolutionary enthusiasm, will there even be a calm and scientific analysis of revolutionary work? If one fundamentally does not want to strive for the top, will there be a calm and scientific analysis of how to fully utilize objective conditions to highly develop subjective initiative and strive for the greatest achievements possible? Practice is the basis of knowledge, and doing is practice. What "name" can be analyzed without doing?
    The reason why right opportunists commit right opportunist errors is because their hearts are too cold. Some of them were once enthusiastic during the democratic revolution, but that was the enthusiasm of the bourgeois democratic revolution. Their bourgeois worldview has never been transformed, so they cannot be enthusiastic at the stage of the socialist revolution. Precisely because their hearts are cold towards the socialist revolutionary cause, their minds become muddled, and they frantically attack the Great Leap Forward.
    Right opportunists pretend to emphasize "calm scientific analysis," searching for shortcomings everywhere as if looking for treasure. When they find a shortcoming that is only a finger's worth in the entire work, when they find individual things that have not been done well, they adopt the attitude of noble lords to teach the masses: "Look, hasn't it not been done? Hasn't it not been done well? This shows that you don't respect objective laws! This shows that your work plans and methods are subjectivist!" Thus, they throw two big hats at the masses: one is "petty-bourgeois fanaticism"; the other is "subjective idealism." This is nonsense. This precisely shows that they fundamentally do not understand what revolution is, and shows that they themselves are subjective idealist empiricists.
    May I ask the right opportunists, was the October Revolution a great revolutionary movement of the Marxist proletariat, or a "petty-bourgeois fanatic movement"? Presumably, today's right opportunists must admit that the October Revolution was a great proletarian revolutionary movement! However, the right opportunists at that time also attacked the October Revolution as "blind action" and "communists indulging spontaneity"! After more than forty years, the faces of the right opportunists are so similar, as if they were cast from the same mold. Lenin, refuting those right opportunists who slandered the October Revolution, wrote: These "philistines are probably fantasizing about a revolution that mobilizes the masses in a highly organized way all at once (if they have any revolutionary ideas in their heads at all). Such a revolution does not exist and cannot exist." "These philistines cannot understand why the communists believe—and quite rightly so—that their duty is to be with the struggling oppressed masses, rather than with the shopkeeper heroes who stand aside and wait timidly. Since the masses are fighting, they are bound to make mistakes in the struggle. The communists are always with the masses, discover mistakes, explain them to the masses, correct them, and constantly make consciousness triumph over spontaneity." (Collected Works of Lenin, Volume 29, pages 358-359) Today's right opportunists, look in the mirror: are you the attitude of the communists Lenin spoke of? Or the attitude of "philistines," "standing aside, timidly waiting," "yingwei"? Their logic is this: if there are shortcomings and errors in the process of the revolutionary movement, then it is "petty-bourgeois fanaticism." According to this logic, one must negate all revolutionary movements in history and slander the history of the world proletarian revolutionary movement as a "petty-bourgeois fanatic movement." In that case, isn't it very clear which side they are standing on?
    Our vigorous Great Leap Forward was carried out under the leadership of the Party's general line from the very beginning under the socialist system. The masses, after the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, have a very high socialist consciousness. Therefore, its shortcomings are also the smallest, and these shortcomings are corrected extremely quickly. It is a very healthy proletarian revolutionary mass movement.
    "If shortcomings occur, it is subjective idealism"—this logic of the right opportunists is also extremely absurd. The shortcomings that occur in the work are only a finger's worth, and individual things are not done temporarily, which may be due to the fact that the ideas and practices do not conform or do not fully conform to a certain special law; however, it may also be due to other reasons, such as right opportunists spreading right-leaning ideas there, and the masses being temporarily affected. Saying "what has not been done must be that objective conditions do not allow it to be done" is a replica of Hegel's idealist formula "whatever exists is rational." That is to say, this is due to non-compliance or even fundamental violation of a certain special law, but this is also not related to "subjective idealism." Their direction is right, they are going all out, striving for the top, building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, their actions are in line with the general law, so they have achieved tremendous results; moreover, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, they calmly analyzed and timely corrected the shortcomings of only one finger, and for things that were not done, reviewed the reasons, and continued to work hard to study methods according to objective conditions. Is this not respecting objective laws, respecting materialism and dialectics?
    May I ask, what is subjective idealism? Subjective idealism is the denial of objective reality that exists outside the mind, the denial of objective laws. This is common sense. However, the right opportunists also got this common sense question wrong. May I ask, in which Marxist book does it say that everything subjective that does not conform to the objective must be due to subjective idealism? True, the subjective cognition and action of subjective idealists must not conform to the objective; but one cannot say in reverse: everything subjective cognition and action that does not conform to the objective must be caused by subjective idealism. Because the unity of the subjective and the objective, that is, the recognition of objective laws, is a process, and its basis is practice. People recognize objective laws through practice and summarizing practical experience. When a new job is to be done, due to the lack of this practical experience, it is impossible to figure out all its regularity beforehand, so shortcomings and errors in the work process are inevitable. Of course, Marxists, guided by the world outlook of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, can avoid major mistakes even in the absence of practical experience, and can timely correct individual errors. If you say that since you have not figured out all its regularity, you should not do it, and wait until you have fully studied it in the house before doing it, this is the real subjective idealism. To leave practice and rely on a genius brain to recognize objective laws is not subjective idealism? Not doing it can indeed avoid making mistakes; however, committing the mistake of "not doing it" is the final straw. What qualifications does he have to pretend to be a "Zhuge Liang" after the fact to point fingers?
    Certain individual shortcomings in the work process are fundamentally not a violation of any objective law in terms of mastering and leading the entire process. Because objective law is the essential connection of things, that is, the direction and basic line of the development process of things. Scientific prediction can only predict regularity and necessity, and cannot know all the accidental and secondary details. Scientific prediction is not the myth of Liu Bowen's "Tui Bei Tu," which can calculate a specific event that will happen in a certain year, month, day, hour, and minute. Therefore, in the case of clearly foreseeing regularity to grasp the movement, in the work process, unexpected situations will also—it should be said necessarily—occur. Due to objective conditions, temporary shortcomings occurred in temporary measures, which is fundamentally not a violation of objective laws.
    Wu Song, who fought tigers on Jingyang Ridge, never violated objective laws in fighting tigers, right? He killed the man-eating tiger. If there was a right opportunist present at that time, he would probably hide behind a distant big tree, secretly recording which punches Wu Song did not hit the tiger's body, and which punches did not hit the tiger's vital points, and after the tiger was killed, he would come out and settle accounts with Wu Song, reprimanding Wu Song: Why didn't you punch the tiger in the eye with one punch. If he were a "philosopher," he would probably blame Wu Song for being fanatical and violating objective laws; if he were an "economist," he would probably blame Wu Song for violating the economic principle of "spending a small amount of labor to create more value." Wasn't the tiger killed? If he doesn't have ulterior motives, what else does he want?
    The revolutionary drive of the broad masses, under the illumination of the Party's correct and great general line, created the Great Leap Forward and created rich and valuable experience. They are the collective tiger-fighting hero Wu Song, they are the collective Zhuge Liang. The Great Leap Forward made us more deeply aware of the importance of "going all out." Drive not only produces steel and grain, but also produces knowledge. Doing is the decisive material force of victory; doing is the basis for an increasingly deeper understanding of objective laws. Revolutionary drive is needed forever and ever, and the greater the better. Long live the revolutionary drive!

    革命的干劲万岁
    关锋
    右倾机会主义分子，污蔑我们的大跃进为“小资产阶级的狂热性运动”。这句恶毒的话，也从反面道着了一条真理，这就是：我们所以能够大跃进、获得巨大成绩，就是因为在党的建设社会主义的总路线光辉照耀下，全国人民热了起来。这热，不是什么“小资产阶级的狂热”，而是对于社会主义事业的革命热，要求迅速改变“一穷二白”的状况，把我国建成一个伟大社会主义国家的热。这种高度的革命热情，化成了冲天干劲，所以“河水也得让路”，“高山也得低头”，所以我们的第二个五年计划的主要指标可能在两年之内完成。没有这样一股子革命热情和革命干劲，是不行的。没有革命热情和革命干劲，再好的计划，也不能实现。右倾机会主义分子的咒骂，也从反面证明了我们作得对，热得好，干劲鼓得千正确、万正确。我们要把革命热情提高提高再提高，干劲一鼓再鼓。
    革命的热情越高越好，革命的干劲越大越好。这也有过度吗？没有。不错，我们提倡又热又冷。但是，这并不是说对社会主义事业要半条心肠热、半条心肠冷，或忽冷忽热；而是说心要热，头要冷——即冷静地科学分析。这就是说，要把革命热情、革命干劲同冷静地科学分析结合起来，以便把力量使到最当劲的地方上去，争取最大的效果。在一定的时机，多强调一些冷静的科学分析，是必要的。但一般而论，革命的热情和革命的干劲却更加重要。它是主导的一面。因为革命热情和革命干劲是冷静的科学分析的前提；心冷，没劲，就谈不上什么科学分析。没有革命热情，还会对于革命工作进行冷静的科学分析吗？根本不想力争上游，还会对如何充分利用客观条件高度发挥主观能动性、争取可能争取到的最大成绩进行冷静的科学分析吗？实践是认识的基础，干就是实践，不干还能分析出什么“名堂”来？
    右倾机会主义分子所以犯右倾机会主义的错误，就是因为他们的心太冷了。其中有些人，在民主革命时期也曾经热过，但那是资产阶级的民主革命的热。他们的资产阶级世界观一直没有得到改造，所以到了社会主义革命阶段就热不起来了。他们正因为对社会主义革命事业心冷，所以头脑就发了昏，疯狂地攻击大跃进。
    右倾机会主义分子装作强调“冷静地科学分析”，像寻找宝贝似地到处寻找缺点，找到在全部工作中不过是一个指头的缺点，找到个别没有办好的事情，就拿出贵族老爷的态度教训群众：“你看，不是没有做到吗？不是没有办好吗？可见你们不尊重客观规律！可见你们的工作计划和工作方法是主观主义的！”于是向群众掼下两顶大帽子：一曰“小资产阶级的狂热性”；二曰“主观唯心主义”。这是瞎说。这恰好表明了他们根本不懂得什么叫革命，表明他们自己是主观唯心主义的经验论者。
    请问右倾机会主义者，十月革命是马克思主义的无产阶级的伟大革命运动，还是“小资产阶级的狂热性运动”？大概今天的右倾机会主义者，总得承认十月革命是伟大的无产阶级革命运动吧！可是，当时的右倾机会主义者也攻击十月革命是“盲动主义”、“共产党人纵容自发性”哩！前后相隔四十多年，右倾机会主义者们的嘴脸竟是如此相同，好像一个模子里塑出来的。列宁回击那些诽谤十月革命的右倾机会主义者写道：这班“庸人先生们，大概正在幻想着一种把群众一下子十分有组织地发动起来的革命（如果一般说来他们头脑中还有一点点革命思想的话）。这样的革命是没有的，也是不可能有的。”“这些庸人不能了解为什么共产党人认为——而且十分正确地认为——自己的职责是同斗争着的被压迫群众在一起，而不是同那站在一旁、胆小地期待着的市侩英雄在一起。群众既然进行斗争，在斗争中就不免要犯错误，共产党人始终同群众在一起，发现错误，向群众进行解释，加以改正，不断地使自觉性战胜自发性。”（“列宁全集”第二十九卷，第三百五十八页—三百五十九页）今天的右倾机会主义者照照镜子吧：你们是列宁所说的共产党人的态度呢？还是“庸人先生”、“站在一旁、胆小地期待着的”“英维们”的态度呢？他们的逻辑是这样的：革命运动过程中有缺点、错误，就是“小资产阶级狂热性”。按照这条逻辑，就要否定历史上的一切革命运动，把世界无产阶级革命运动史一概污蔑为“小资产阶级狂热性运动”。那样一来，他们站到了那一边去，不是很明白了吗？
    我们的轰轰烈烈的大跃进，是在社会主义制度下一开始就在党的总路线领导下进行的。群众，经过了经济战线和政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命，有了很高的社会主义觉悟。因此，它的缺点也最小，这些缺点被纠正得也极快。它是非常健康的无产阶级的革命群众运动。
    “发生了缺点，就是主观唯心主义”——右倾机会主义分子的这条逻辑也是极其荒谬的。工作中发生的不过是一个指头的缺点，个别事情暂时没有办到，可能是由于想法和做法不符合或不尽符合某一个特殊规律；但是，也可能是由于别的原因，例如右倾机会主义分子在那里散布了右倾思想、群众暂时的受了影响就是一个。说“没做到的就一定是客观条件不许可做到的”，这是黑格尔的“存在的都是合理的”这个唯心主义公式的翻版。就是说这是由于不符合甚至根本违背了某个特殊规律吧，这也是和“主观唯心主义”不相干的。他们的方向对，他们是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义，他们的行动符合总的规律，因此取得了巨大成绩；而且，他们在党中央的英明领导下，冷静地分析了和及时地纠正了不过是一个指头的缺点，对没有做到的事，检讨原因，再接再厉地根据客观情况研究办法努力去做。难道这不是尊重客观规律，尊重唯物论和辩证法吗？
    请问，什么是主观唯心主义？主观唯心主义就是否认在头脑以外存在的客观实在，否认客观规律。这是常识。可是，右倾机会主义分子把这个常识问题也弄错了。请问在那一本马克思主义的书上说过：凡是主观不符合客观就一定是由于主观唯心主义？不错，主观唯心主义者，其主观认识和行动一定是不符合客观；可是不能反过来说：凡是主观认识和行动不符合客观一定是主观唯心主义作怪。因为主观和客观统一，即认识客观规律是一个过程，它的基础是实践。人们是通过实践、总结实践经验认识客观规律的。当着一件新的工作要做，由于缺乏这种实践经验，事前不可能把它的全部规律性摸清楚，所以工作过程中的缺点和错误是难免的。当然，马克思主义者由于有辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观作指导，就是在缺乏实践经验的条件下，也可以不犯大错误，而且能够及时地纠正个别错误。如果说，既然没有把它的全部规律性摸清楚就不要干，等到坐在房子里全部研究清楚以后再干，这才是真正的主观唯心主义。要离开实践，凭着天才的脑袋去认识客观规律，还不是主观唯心主义？不干，确确实实可以不犯错误；然而，犯“不干”这一条错误就到了家了。他还有什么资格冒充事后的“诸葛亮”来指手划脚呢？
    工作过程中的某些个别缺点，就对于整个过程的掌握和领导来说，根本就不是违背了什么客观规律。因为客观规律即事物的本质联系，即事物发展过程的方向、基本路线。科学预见，只能预见规律性、必然性，而不能知道所有的偶然的次要的细节。科学预见，并不是刘伯温的“推背图”那种神话，可以计算出某年某月某时某刻发生某一件具体事情。所以在清楚地预见到规律性的情况下掌握运动，在工作过程中也会——应该说必然碰到事先预料不到的情况发生，由于客观条件，临时措置上发生了暂时性的缺点，这根本就不是什么违背客观规律。
    景阳岗打虎的武松，在打虎上总是没有违背客观规律吧？他把吃人的老虎打死了。那时如果有一个右倾机会主义者在场，恐怕要躲在远远的大树后边，暗暗地记录武松那几拳没有打在老虎的身上，那几拳没有击中老虎的要害，等老虎被打死以后出来和武松算账，斥责武松：你为什么不一拳打在老虎的眼睛上。如果他是位“哲学家”，大概就要责备武松狂热、违背了客观规律；如果他是位“经济学家”，大概要责备武松违背了“化费少量的劳动，创造更多的价值”的经济原则。老虎，不是打死了吗？如果他不是别有用心，还要求些什么呢？
    广大群众的革命干劲，在党的正确、伟大的总路线照耀下，创造了大跃进，创造了丰富的宝贵经验。他们是集体的打虎英雄武松，他们是集体的诸葛亮。大跃进使我们更深刻地认识了“鼓足干劲”的重要性。干劲不但出钢铁、出粮食，而且出认识。干，是胜利的决定性的物质力量；干，是越来越深刻的认识客观规律的基础。永远永远需要革命的干劲，而且越大越好。革命的干劲万岁！
