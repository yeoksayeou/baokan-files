    Ten Years of Cultivating People
    ——A Record of the Ten-Year Achievements of Higher Education in New China
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Pan Di

    In the short span of ten years in human life, while leading the people of the whole country in the heroic construction of the socialist motherland, our Party has also begun to write a brand new and glorious page in the history of Chinese education: "Ten Years of Cultivating People."

    In the past ten years, the New China's universities and colleges, shouldering the task of cultivating construction talents, have provided 430,000 graduates for various national construction undertakings. This number is equal to twice the total number of 210,000 university graduates in the old China during the thirty-six years from 1912 to 1947. These 430,000 graduates include talents in various specialties needed in our country's magnificent economic construction and cultural and scientific undertakings since entering the socialist era. This group of intellectual youths cultivated by the New China's universities and colleges, under the care and cultivation of the Party, and through training in various work and labor, are rapidly becoming a backbone force in the country's rapidly developing construction undertakings, advancing towards the goal of being both red and expert!

    The Party's Hard Work
    Ten years ago, what we took over was a semi-feudal and semi-colonial higher education system. At that time, there were few academic departments, the equipment was dilapidated and incomplete, and the teachers and students were full of bourgeois ideas. The Party led these schools across the country in carrying out the movements of departmental adjustment, teaching reform, and ideological transformation, thoroughly transforming the old China's higher education and building and developing it into a socialist higher education system. In order to meet the needs of national industrialization, the Party and the state transferred a large number of teachers and equipment to universities and colleges, and newly established specialized colleges in geology, mining, aviation, civil engineering, architecture, water conservancy, post and telecommunications, railways, highways, shipbuilding, chemical industry, automobiles, and tractors, which did not exist in old China. More than 300 specialties including the peaceful use of atomic energy, electronic computers, semiconductors, automatic control, and electronics, the latest in science and technology, were established in universities and colleges. In order to strengthen the connection between theoretical teaching and practice, and to improve the material conditions for higher education and scientific research, the state invested a large amount of financial and material resources in universities and colleges during the First Five-Year Plan, built a large number of school buildings and laboratories, and supplemented several times more books and equipment than all the universities and colleges in the old China for fifty years. In terms of basic construction, the state built more than 11 million square meters of new school buildings from 1950 to 1958, which is more than three times the total area of 3.4 million square meters of university and college buildings built in the old China for fifty years. The teaching equipment of many schools has gone from nothing to something, from less to more, and from old to new (modernized). During this period, more than a thousand laboratories with modern scientific instruments and equipment were established. Higher engineering colleges also established more than 10,000 affiliated factories and production workshops. These factories and workshops have tens of thousands of new lathes and various machines. Agricultural and forestry colleges are all attached to large-scale farms or forest farms; medical colleges all have well-equipped affiliated hospitals. The annual expenditure on higher education in New China exceeds sixteen times the average annual expenditure on higher education in old China. Thanks to the attention of the Party and the state, higher education in New China is developing at an unprecedented speed. The number of full-time university students increased from 117,000 at the beginning of the founding of the country (1949) to 660,000 in 1958, an increase of 4.7 times in nine years. This rate of development exceeds that of all Western capitalist countries. In the United States, the number of students in universities and colleges increased by only 1.5 times in the 22 years from 1931 to 1953 (from 910,000 to 2.25 million); in the United Kingdom, it only increased by half during the same period (56,700 - 85,800). The average rate of development of higher education in our country is 2.5 times faster than that of the United States; 10 times faster than that of the United Kingdom; and much faster than that of Japan, which has the fastest development of higher education among capitalist countries. In Japan, the number of students increased by 410,000 in the 23 years from 1931 to 1954, while in our country, it increased by 540,000 in nine years.

    With far-sightedness, the Party and the state stipulated that the new type of talents we want to cultivate should be "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." This stipulation fundamentally distinguishes the talents we cultivate from the graduates of universities and colleges in old China and any capitalist country. People know that it is not surprising that agricultural students trained by the bourgeois method of teaching divorced from reality do not recognize wheat, forestry students do not recognize trees without specimens, and engineering students do not know how to use machines. The purpose of college students in capitalist countries is to pursue personal fame, gain, status, and enjoyment. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, higher education in our New China implements the Party's education policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education being combined with productive labor." The quality of teaching is constantly improving, young students have a clear learning purpose of serving the people and building the socialist motherland, and have established the goal of striving to be both red and expert. During their studies, they pay attention to cultivating the ability to work independently. For example, the graduation designs of many students in various schools are combined with current production practices and scientific research tasks. The recently completed Miyun Reservoir, which is three times the size of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, was constructed according to the graduation design of the graduates of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of Tsinghua University last year.

    Soaring Wings
    Graduates of the New China's universities and colleges, like young and strong eagles, are spreading their wings of talent and wisdom, soaring freely in the clear sky of the motherland's socialist construction.

    When people are cheered by every production victory on the iron and steel front, they will remember that among those heroic steel fighters, there are young technicians sent by our universities and colleges. They serve as foremen, furnace chiefs, and engineers in blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces in various iron and steel bases such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and Wuhan Iron and Steel. They and the workers are engaged in fierce battles for steel in front of furnaces with temperatures of 1,500 degrees Celsius. Wang Xiqing, the foreman of the No. 9 blast furnace in Anshan Iron and Steel, is a graduate of the Department of Iron and Steel Metallurgy of Northeast Institute of Technology. In leading the production of blast furnaces, he operates meticulously, maintains the blast furnace smoothly, and can humbly work with the workers to find ways to improve production. Thanks to his and the workers' multifaceted efforts, he created the highest national record for the utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces in May and June of this year. In China's first large-scale seamless steel pipe plant, when you see those rows of world-class automated mechanical equipment, and see these machines operating flexibly, spitting out seamless steel pipes that are exquisite and bright, who would have thought that it is only nine assistant engineers who graduated from colleges, universities, and secondary technical schools after liberation who are technically maintaining the normal operation of these thousands of tons of machines? Among them, Wang Jiazheng, who is fully responsible for the production technology of the entire plant, is just a young woman who left Tangshan Institute of Technology in 1952. Last year, the situation of the Great Leap Forward encouraged them to boldly innovate and create. Wang Jiazheng and two other engineering and technical personnel who graduated from colleges and universities, with the support of the Party Committee, adopted the internationally advanced technology of "reducing diameter and drawing rolling," recalculated the speed of the machine, designed the hole pattern, and adjusted the test with the workers, increasing the machine's productivity by 30%. She also worked with the workers to study a series of technical innovation measures such as increasing the roll diameter of the tube rolling mill and increasing the angle of the piercing machine, increasing production capacity by 40%. Thanks to these technical improvements, the potential of the equipment was tapped. Last year, the factory produced 150,000 tons of steel pipes, exceeding the factory's equipment capacity by one and a half times. In various iron and steel bases across the country, the situation where graduates trained by the New China's universities and colleges are independently responsible for technology, like Wang Xiqing and Wang Jiazheng, is relatively common.

    On the production fronts of coal mining, machinery manufacturing, railway construction, and geological exploration, there are also engineering and technical personnel who graduated from the New China's universities and colleges fighting alongside the workers. They have not only become important technical forces on these production fronts, but also shown considerable knowledge and ability in actual work, and are able to play a creative role in their work. In the coal capital of Fushun, Yu Changxing, the compiler of the "Longfeng Mine Geological Data Report," which is of great value to the current coal production, and a technician of the Geological Section of Fushun Longfeng Mine, is a 1953 graduate of Beijing Mining Institute. Thanks to the guidance of this report, it is possible to fully mine the coal in many chambers with unclear geological conditions. This geological report also clarified the situation of the chambers that had been mined in the past, and found more than 800,000 tons of coal lost during the Japanese puppet period. Currently, this coal is being mined. Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory is the first modern heavy machinery factory in our country designed and constructed by its own engineering and technical personnel. More than half of the dozen or so tall reinforced concrete structures of important workshops were designed by college graduates who had just left school. For example, the hydraulic workshop, a key piece of equipment in the entire factory, had never been seen by anyone before. Xiao Hongfang, a young designer who graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1952, bravely undertook this design task with only a few materials and insufficient experience. Relying on the scientific theoretical knowledge he had learned, he carefully studied the relevant technical theories of the Soviet Union, humbly asked experienced veteran engineering and technical personnel and workers for advice, and gave play to the spirit of independent thinking and bold creation, and finally designed the first formal hydraulic workshop in China. Now these workshops have been built one after another and have begun to produce various large-scale cranes and rolling mills of more than 50 tons. In many new railway line projects such as Lanxin, Tianlan, Baolan, Baocheng, Chengyu, and Fengsha, a large number of university graduates are also rapidly becoming experienced engineering and technical personnel. In August 1954, Li Xian, a young intern foreman, came to the first team of the Bridge Engineering Team of the northern section of the Baocheng Line. As soon as he arrived, he put on work clothes and jumped into the mud pit to work with the workers. People later learned that Li Xian was originally a graduate of Tangshan Railway Institute in 1954. He served as the technical guidance for the 570+10 overpass. During the construction of this bridge, he found that it was a dry bridge that did not flow water all year round, and in the original design, round caps (waterproof slope protection) requiring more than 3,000 cubic meters of stone material were designed at both ends of the bridge. After careful research and calculation, he suggested canceling the round caps in the original design and using retaining walls instead, which not only accelerated the construction period, but also saved 2,000 cubic meters of stone material, saving the country more than 10,000 yuan. In the construction of other bridges, he worked hard to study technical problems, boldly carried out technical innovations, and changed the original improper designs according to the actual situation, ensuring the quality and time of construction, and saving the country a total of more than 800,000 yuan. After two years of work experience, Li Xian was appointed as an engineer. Over the years, he has been continuously rated as an advanced producer and attended the National Congress of Young Socialist Activists and the National Congress of Advanced Producers.

    Graduates of the New China's universities and colleges are strongly supporting the socialist construction of the country in various fields, and are playing an increasingly important role. In the past ten years, 50,000 graduates have supplemented the ranks of university teachers. The vast majority of lecturers currently giving courses are graduates of universities and colleges after liberation. Of the 70,000 physicians in the country, graduates of medical colleges and universities in New China account for 40,000. University graduates have also made significant achievements in various construction positions such as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, natural science, and social science research.

    The reporter has visited many universities and colleges, and has also seen graduates of our universities and colleges in many factories and mining enterprises. In conversations with them, I felt that they deeply understood their own happiness. If someone asks: Who gave them true knowledge? Who taught them the true meaning of life? Who opened up a world for them to display their talents and wisdom? Who guided them to a bright and happy future? They will answer in unison: It is the wise Communist Party, it is the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao.

    十年树人
    ——记新中国高等教育的十年成就
    新华社记者　潘荻
    在人类生活的短暂的十年中，我们的党在领导全国人民英勇建设社会主义祖国的同时，还在中国教育史上，开始写下了“十年树人”的崭新、光辉的一页。
    十年来，担负着培养建设人材任务的新中国高等学校，已为国家各项建设事业输送了四十三万名毕业生。这个数字，等于从1912到1947年三十六年间旧中国大学毕业生总数二十一万人的二倍。这四十三万名毕业生，包括了适应我们国家进入社会主义年代以来在宏伟的经济建设和文化科学事业方面所需要的各个专业的人材。这一批新中国高等学校培养出来的知识青年，在党的关怀、培养下，在各项工作和劳动的锻炼中，正在迅速成为国家飞速发展着的建设事业的一支骨干力量，向着又红又专的目标兼程前进！
    党的苦心
    十年前，我们接收下来的是一个半封建半殖民地的高等教育体系，那时，学术科系很少，设备破烂不全，师生中充满了资产阶级思想。党在全国范围内领导这些学校进行了院系调整、教学改革和思想改造运动，对旧中国的高等教育，进行了彻底的改造，把它建设发展成为社会主义的高等教育体系。为适应国家工业化建设需要，党和国家给高等学校调集了大量师资、设备，新建立了地质、矿业、航空、土木、建筑、水利、邮电、铁道、公路、造船、化工、汽车、拖拉机等旧中国所没有的专门学院；在高等学校中设置了包括和平利用原子能、电子计算机、半导体、自动控制、电子学等最新科学技术的三百多种专业。为加强理论教学和实际的联系，改善高等学校和科学研究的物质条件，国家在第一个五年计划期间，就对高等学校投入了大量财力、物力，修建了大批校舍和实验室，补充了数倍于旧中国五十年高等学校所有的图书和仪器设备。在基本建设方面，国家自1950至1958年共新建校舍一千一百多万平方米，等于旧中国五十年修建的高等学校校舍总面积三百四十万平方米的三倍多。许多学校的教学设备，都是从无到有，从少到多，从旧到新（近代化）。这个时期共建立了上千个拥有现代科学仪器设备的实验室。高等工科院校还建立了上万个附属工厂和生产性质的车间，这些工厂、车间拥有上万台新式车床和各种机器。农林院校都附设有大面积的农场或林场；医学院校都有设备较好的附属医院。新中国每年高等教育经费的支出，要超过旧中国平均每年高等教育经费的十六倍以上。由于党和国家的重视，新中国高等教育以空前的速度发展着。全日制高等学校学生在校人数，建国初年（1949）才十一万七千人，到1958年已发展到六十六万人，九年中增长了四点七倍。这种发展速度，超过了所有西方资本主义国家。美国在1931年到1953年的二十二年间，高等学校在校人数只增加了一点五倍（由九十一万增加到二百二十五万）；英国同期内才增加半倍（五点六七万——八点五八万）。我国高等教育发展速度平均比美国要快二点五倍；比英国快十倍；比资本主义国家高等教育发展最快的日本，也要快得多。日本在1931—1954年二十三年间，在校人数增加了四十一万，而我国九年中就增加了五十四万人。
    党和国家以深远的目光，规定了我们所要培养的新型的人材应该是“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。这个规定使我们所培养的人材根本区别于旧中国以及任何资本主义国家的高等学校毕业生。人们知道，用资产阶级脱离实际的教学方法培养出来的农科学生，不认识小麦，林科学生离开标本就不认识树木，工科学生不会弄机器，并不是奇怪的事情。资本主义国家大学生学习的目的在于追求个人名利、地位和享受。而我们新中国的高等教育，在共产党领导下，贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育方针，教学质量不断提高，青年学生都有了明确的为人民服务、建设社会主义祖国的学习目的，树立了又红又专的努力目标，并在学习期间就注意培养了独立工作的能力。例如各学校许多学生的毕业设计，都是结合当前生产实际和科学研究任务来进行。最近竣工的相当于十三陵水库三倍大的密云水库，就是按照去年清华大学水利系毕业生的毕业设计进行施工的。
    展翅飞翔
    新中国高等学校的毕业生，像年青健壮的雄鹰，舒展着才能与智慧的双翼，正在祖国社会主义建设的晴空尽情飞翔着。
    人们为钢铁战线上每一个生产捷报而欢欣鼓舞的时候，会想起那些英勇的钢铁战士中，有我们的高等学校输送去的青年技术人员。他们在鞍钢、包钢、武钢等各个钢铁基地，担任着高炉、平炉的工长、炉长、工程师等职务。他们和工人一道在一千五百度高温炉前，进行着激烈的夺钢战斗。鞍钢九号高炉的工长王喜庆是东北工学院钢铁冶炼系的毕业生。他在领导高炉生产中，操作细致，维护高炉顺利，并能虚心地和工人一起设法提高生产。由于他和工人们一起多方面的努力，曾在今年5、6月份创造了大型高炉利用系数全国最高纪录。在我国第一座大型无缝钢管厂，看到那一排排堪称世界第一流自动化的机械设备，看到这些机器灵活地运转，吐出一根根玲珑透亮的无缝钢管时，谁又能想到：从技术上维护这数千吨机器正常运转的，只是九个解放后大专、中技学校毕业的助理工程师呢？其中对全厂生产技术全面负责的汪家铮，也不过是1952年才离开唐山工学院的一位女青年。去年，大跃进的形势鼓舞他们大胆革新、创造。汪家铮和另外两个大专学校毕业的工程技术人员，在党委支持下，采用国际上先进技术“减径机带拉轧制”，重新计算机器的转速，设计孔型，和工人一起调整试验，提高了机器生产力30％。她还和工人一起研究出轧管机的辊径加大、穿孔机角度改大等一系列的技术革新措施，提高生产能力40％。由于这些技术上的改进，挖掘了设备潜力，去年这个工厂生产了十五万吨钢管，超过工厂设备能力的一倍半。在全国各个钢铁基地，像王喜庆、汪家铮等人一样，由新中国高等学校培养出来的毕业生在技术上独当一面的情况，是比较普遍的。
    在采煤、机器制造、铁路修建、地质勘查等各个生产战线上，也都有新中国高等学校毕业的工程技术人员在和工人们一道战斗。他们不仅成为这些生产战线上重要的技术力量，并在实际工作中，显示出有相当的知识和能力，并且能够在工作中发挥创造性。在煤都抚顺，对当前煤炭生产极有价值的“龙凤矿地质资料报告书”的编撰者、抚顺龙凤矿地质科技术员于长兴，就是北京矿业学院1953年的毕业生。由于有了这部报告书的指导，许多地质情况不明的掌子的煤，有了全部开采出来的可能。这部地质报告书还摸清了过去已采掌子的情况，找出了日伪时期丢失的煤八十多万吨。目前正在对这些煤进行开采。太原重型机器厂是我国历史上第一个由自己的工程技术人员设计施工的现代化重型机器工厂。十几个高大的钢筋结构的重要车间，有半数以上是刚走出学校门的高等学校毕业生负责设计的。像全厂关键性设备的水压车间，过去谁也没见过它是什么样子。1952年从上海交通大学毕业的青年设计员萧洪芳，在仅有少数材料和经验不足的情况下，勇敢地承担了这个设计任务。他凭着所学的科学理论知识，认真钻研苏联的有关技术理论，虚心向有经验的老工程技术人员和工人请教，并且发挥独立思考、大胆创造的精神，终于设计出来中国第一个正规水压车间。现在这些车间都陆续建成，开始生产着五十吨以上的各种大型起重机和轧钢机。在兰新、天兰、包兰、宝成、成渝、丰沙等许多铁路新线工程中，大批高等学校毕业生也在迅速成为有经验的工程技术人员。1954年8月，宝成线北段桥工队一分队，来了一个名叫李显的年青实习工长。他一来到这里，就穿上工作服，跳进泥坑和工人们一起干起活来。人们后来才知道李显原来是1954年唐山铁道学院的毕业生。他在这里担任了570＋10跨线桥的技术指导。在这座桥的施工中，他发现这是一座长年不流水的旱桥，而原设计上，在桥的两端设计了需要三千多立方料石的圆包头（防水披坡）。他经过仔细研究和计算，提出建议将原设计上圆包头取消，改用砌挡土墙办法，既加速了工期，又节约了料石二千立方，为国家节省资金一万多元。在其他好些桥梁施工中，他都是这样刻苦钻研技术问题，大胆进行技术革新，根据实际情况改变原有不妥的设计，保证了施工质量和时间，前后共为国家节约资金八十多万元。两年的工作锻炼，李显就担任了工程师的职务。几年来，他连续被评为先进生产者，出席过全国青年社会主义积极分子代表大会和全国先进生产者代表大会。
    新中国高等学校的毕业生，正在有力地支援着国家各个方面的社会主义建设，发挥出越来越大的作用。十年中，有五万毕业生补充了高等学校教师的队伍。目前开课的讲师，绝大部分都是解放后高等学校毕业的。全国七万医师中，新中国高等医药院校的毕业生就占去四万。在农、林、水利、自然科学和社会科学研究等各个建设岗位上，高等学校毕业生也都作出了显著的成绩。
    记者访问过不少高等学校，也在不少厂矿企业里见到过我们高等学校的毕业生。在和他们的谈话中，我感到他们深深地懂得自己的幸福。如果有人问：谁给了他们真正的知识？谁教导他们生活的真正意义？谁为他们开辟了施展才能和智慧的天地？谁引导他们走向光明、幸福的前途？他们会同声回答：是英明的共产党，是人民的伟大领袖毛主席。
