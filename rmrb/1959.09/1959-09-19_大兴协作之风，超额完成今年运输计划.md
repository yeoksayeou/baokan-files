    Promote the Spirit of Collaboration and Overfulfill This Year's Transportation Plan
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    The communist spirit of collaboration that emerged during the Great Leap Forward movement last year is continuing to be promoted between transportation departments and industrial and mining enterprises. Following the advanced experiences of road-mine and road-factory collaboration created in the Fuxin and Benxi areas, the Qinhuangdao Port Authority and Station have further created an advanced method of "one-dragon" collaboration to improve labor productivity, providing good experience for road-port collaboration. These new creations are a tremendous achievement made by millions of workers on China's transportation front, under the shining light of the General Line!
    The so-called "one-dragon" collaboration is a comprehensive organization of collaboration among various departments such as coal mines that send coal all the way to the arrival port, with loading and unloading ports and stations as hubs, connecting the railway department's Red Flag direct trains and the shipping department's fixed-route, fixed-schedule ships. It connects railway departments' Red Flag direct trains and shipping departments' fixed-route, fixed-schedule ships, forming a continuous transportation process for the entire land and sea journey. The "one-dragon" collaboration presented to people is a moving picture: starting from China's famous coal production base—Fuxin, traversing the high mountains and plains of Northeast China, crossing the Great Wall, passing through Qinhuangdao Port, south across the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea, going upstream along the Huangpu River, and arriving at China's largest port—Shanghai. It consists of miners holding high the Great Leap Forward red flag, countless Red Flag direct trains, and fixed-route, fixed-schedule ships, forming a huge "red dragon" stretching thousands of miles. It ensures that a large amount of coal, once produced from the mine, is transported directly to the industrial departments in Shanghai without ever touching the ground. The "one-dragon" collaboration further enriches the content of collaboration between transportation departments and industrial and mining enterprises, and is of extremely important significance for accelerating the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods, and ensuring that the transportation industry better serves industrial and agricultural production.
    Why do we repeatedly emphasize that collaboration between transportation departments and factories and mines is of great significance? The reason is very simple. Communist all-round collaboration is one of the basic characteristics of socialist production relations, a major method of carrying out socialist production well, and an important factor in promoting the continuous improvement of labor productivity. Socialist enterprises of all kinds carry out production in a planned and proportionate manner under the unified arrangement of the country. The superiority of the socialist economy provides broad prospects for the development of cooperative relations. Whether it is between departments, between enterprises, or within enterprises, it is all based on mutual assistance, mutual cooperation, mutual support, close collaboration, and common improvement. The transportation department is an important production department in the national economy. As Marx said, it is the continuation of the production process in the circulation process. Its greatest characteristic is its extensive connection with all aspects. Not only does it have an inseparable relationship with the extractive industry, the processing industry, and the shipping department, but it is also an important link connecting industry and agriculture, cities and villages, production and consumption. Therefore, strengthening collaboration is of particular importance to the transportation department.
    From the current economic situation, organizing large-scale collaboration in the transportation department obviously has a more urgent practical significance. In order to realize the grand leap forward plan proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the transportation department bears a glorious and arduous task. This year, it must increase railway freight volume to 520 million tons, and ship and automobile freight volume to 420 million tons. In the first eight months of this year, the transportation department continued to leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, and the freight volume increased greatly compared with the same period last year. However, to complete this huge leap forward plan, significant efforts are still needed. According to statistics, by the end of August, the railway freight volume had completed 320 million tons, and the ship and automobile freight volume had also completed 260 million tons. This means that in the four months from September to December, it is necessary to complete about 38% of the annual freight volume in order to meet the requirements of continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The current problem is that the transportation volume is large but the transportation capacity is insufficient. This situation requires the transportation department to greatly promote the spirit of collaboration in order to fully tap the potential of the transportation sector and accelerate the turnover of vehicles, ships, and goods. This has not only been proven by the experience of road-mine and road-factory collaboration in Fuxin, Benxi and other places, but also by the experience of collaboration between many ports and stations such as Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, and Chongqing. Taking Qinhuangdao as an example, after implementing the "one-dragon" collaboration, close cooperation between the port, station, and ships greatly shortened the loading and unloading time and ship berthing time, which is equivalent to adding more than 1,800 train cars of transportation capacity between Qinhuangdao and Fuxin, and can transport more than 72,000 tons of coal; it is equivalent to adding a 7,200-ton ship from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai, which can transport more than 100,000 tons of coal. Due to the implementation of direct loading and unloading of vehicles and ships, efficiency has been greatly improved, saving an average of 420 workers per day. Collaboration has brought great benefits to all parties such as roads, ports, ships, and cargo owners. In the first half of this year, the cargo throughput of Qinhuangdao Port increased by 182% compared with the same period last year; the loading and unloading volume of the station increased by nearly double; the ships of the Shanghai Maritime Transport Bureau implemented fixed-route and fixed-schedule results, which shortened the voyage time by more than ten hours, and the transportation capacity saved throughout the year is equivalent to adding a 10,000-ton ship's transportation capacity for thirty-three and a half days; the number of railway Red Flag direct trains has also greatly increased, and the travel time has been shortened by nine hours. The long-standing theory of the two extremes of "fast cars damage fast ships, fast ships damage fast cars" has gone bankrupt, and a situation of mutual promotion and common improvement has emerged. As for the impact on other national economies due to the accelerated turnover of vehicles and ships, the role it plays in accelerating the circulation of goods and saving national working capital is even difficult to estimate for a while. It is conceivable that if the experience of "one-dragon" is widely promoted throughout the country, not only including railways and sea transport, but also including river transport, waterway transport, and road transport, then many "one-dragons" will appear in the national transportation network, and various transportation tools will be closely connected and fully utilize comprehensive utilization efficiency, and provide large, high-quality, safe, fast, and cheap transportation capacity with the least transportation tools. This will definitely play a great role in building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    How can we do a good job in cooperative relations? The most important key is to adhere to putting politics in command and strengthen the leadership of the Party. The fact of large-scale collaboration in the transportation department shows that putting politics in command and the leadership of the Party are the soul of all work in the past, present and future. The process of Qinhuangdao Port and Road from mutual wrangling to close cooperation is a clear contrast. Before the rectification movement in 1957, the port and road sides mainly restricted each other through contracts, which played a certain role in promoting production at that time. However, because the two sides did not establish the communist spirit of collaboration, they often used fines to threaten each other when dealing with problems, "generalled" each other, shirked responsibility when there were difficulties, and blamed each other when there were shortcomings. Some problems were not resolved after half a year of arguing. Later, the Qinhuangdao Municipal Party Committee strengthened its leadership over the road and port, and the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally took command to solve the collaboration problem between the road and port. The Party organizations on both sides carried out meticulous ideological education among cadres and employees, relied on the masses to speak out freely and boldly, destroyed departmentalism in a big way, and established collectivism in a big way. At the beginning of this year, they also carried out education on "the whole country as one chessboard" and criticized departmentalism, so that employees established an overall concept, and as a result, the face immediately changed. "Road and port as one family" has become deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and "difficulties belong to oneself, convenience is given to others" has become a trend. The two sides have changed from offsetting each other's strength to twisting into a rope and jointly realizing the leap forward. This fact eloquently shows that adhering to putting politics in command and strengthening the leadership of the Party is a basic guarantee for doing a good job in collaboration.
    In organizing collaboration between transportation departments, we must also unswervingly carry out mass movements in a big way. The facts of collaboration in Qinhuangdao and many other regions prove that mass movements are an invincible magic weapon, and the vigorousness of mass movements is a normal order, while the cold and quiet situation is an abnormal order. In the implementation of "one-dragon" collaboration in Qinhuangdao, mass movements with rich content and diverse forms were carried out. A large-scale port-ship collaboration competition based on fixed-route and fixed-schedule agreements was launched between ports and ships, and mutual guarantee conditions were proposed. Between the railway and the port, a nine-to-red flag competition was launched to compare ship schedules, compare car points, compare the number of loading and unloading cars, compare workload, compare efficiency, compare safety and quality, compare unity and mutual assistance, and compare advanced trains and advanced ship voyages. Competitions with the important contents of strengthening collaboration, loving ships, loving goods, and loving cars were also launched within the railway, port, ship, and other units. The communist spirit of putting others first and selflessness was promoted in the competition.
    On the basis of mass movements, we should grasp the specific organizational work and strengthen enterprise management, which is an important link to ensure the consolidation and improvement of cooperative relations. First of all, an appropriate organizational form should be established. Guaranteeing the unity of organizational structure, operation process, etc., fully tapping the potential of both parties, and accelerating the turnover of vehicles and ships. Second, we should strengthen enterprise management and establish necessary rules and regulations. In the formulation of rules and regulations, we must incorporate the advanced operating methods of employees into the rules and regulations of land-sea combined transportation. Third, we should adapt to the requirements of large-scale collaboration and carry out reforms in the organization of transportation production. For example, simplifying the technical operation process, implementing a combination of unloading, discharging, and loading, and organizing direct transshipment of vehicles and ships, etc. Fourth, due to the large number of links and complex relationships in the "one-dragon" collaboration, it is also necessary to strengthen the connection between various departments, and also master the comprehensive balance of the monthly plans of mines, railways, and water transport to ensure the smooth progress of "one-dragon" transportation.
    The broad masses of employees on the national transportation front: Now we are getting closer and closer to the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and there are only more than three months left until the end of the year. Mobilize immediately! Promote the spirit of collaboration! Let more "red dragons" fly on the transportation front of our motherland! Let ports, railways, industry and mines, sea transport, cargo owners and other departments work together to create more outstanding achievements to celebrate the great 10th anniversary of our Republic!

    大兴协作之风，超额完成今年运输计划
    本报评论员
    去年大跃进运动中兴起的共产主义协作之风，正继续在交通运输部门和工矿企业之间发扬。继阜新、本溪地区创造路矿、路厂协作的先进经验之后，秦皇岛港务局和车站又进一步创造了“一条龙”大协作的提高劳动生产率的先进方法，为路、港协作提供了良好的经验。这些新的创造，是我国成百万交通运输战线上的职工们，在总路线的光辉照耀下取得的巨大成就！
    所谓“一条龙”大协作，就是由发送煤的矿山一直到到达港之间，以装换港口和车站为枢纽，连结铁路部门的红旗直达列车和海运部门的定线、定班船舶，全面组织矿山、铁路、港口、船运和货主等各部门之间的大协作，一线相连，环环紧扣，形成水陆全程连续不断的运输过程。展现在人们面前的“一条龙”大协作，是一幅动人心魄的图画：它从我国著名的产煤基地——阜新，驰过东北的高山平原，跨越万里长城，经过秦皇岛港口，南度渤海、黄海，沿黄浦江逆流而上，到达我国最大的港口——上海，由高举大跃进红旗的矿工、无数辆红旗直达列车、定线、定班的船只，组成了一个逶迤数千里的巨大的“赤龙”。它保证大量的煤炭从矿山生产出来以后，一直不落地地运往上海工业部门。“一条龙”大协作，进一步丰富了交通运输部门和工矿企业之间协作的内容，对于加速车、船货物周转，保证交通运输事业更好地为工农业生产服务有极其重要的意义。
    为什么我们再三强调交通运输部门和厂矿企业之间的协作有很重要的意义呢？原因很简单，共产主义全面大协作，是社会主义生产关系的基本特征之一，是搞好社会主义生产的主要方法，是促进劳动生产率不断提高的重要因素。社会主义的各种企业，在全国统一安排下，有计划、按比例地进行生产。社会主义经济的优越性，为发展协作关系提供了广阔的前途。无论是部门之间、企业之间，以及企业内部之间，都是建立在互相帮助、互相配合、互相支持、密切协作、共同提高的基础之上。交通运输部门，是国民经济中一个重要的生产部门，正如马克思所说，它是生产过程在流通过程的继续。它的最大特点，是与各方面有着广泛的联系。不仅与采掘工业、加工工业、托运部门有着密不可分的关系，也是沟通工业和农业、城市和乡村、生产和消费等方面的联系的重要环节。因此，加强协作，对交通运输部门尤其有它的特殊重要性。
    从当前的经济形势来看，组织交通运输部门的大协作，显然有更为迫切的现实意义。为了实现党的八届八中全会提出的宏伟跃进计划，交通运输部门担负着光荣而艰巨的任务，要在今年内使铁路货运量达到五亿二千万吨，轮船、汽车货运量达到四亿二千万吨。今年头八个月中，交通运输部门在去年大跃进的基础上继续跃进，货运量比去年同期大大增加，但是，完成这个巨大的跃进计划，仍然需要作重大的努力。据统计，到8月底为止，铁路货运量已完成三亿二千万吨，轮船、汽车货运量也已完成二亿六千万吨。这就是说，在9月到12月的四个月内，必须完成占全年货运量38％左右的运输任务，才能适应工农业生产继续跃进的要求。目前的问题是，运量大而运力不足。这种情况，要求交通运输部门必须大兴协作之风，才能充分发掘交通部门的潜力，加速车、船、货物运转。这不仅已经为阜新、本溪等地路矿、路厂协作的经验所证明，而且也为秦皇岛、青岛、重庆等许多港口、车站协作的经验所证明。以秦皇岛为例；在实行“一条龙”大协作以后，港、站、船等方面亲密协作，大大缩短装卸时间和船舶停泊时间，相当于秦皇岛到阜新间增加了一千八百多车皮的运力，可多运煤炭七万二千多吨；等于从秦皇岛到上海增加一艘七千二百吨的轮船，可多运煤炭十万多吨。由于实行车船直接装卸，大大提高了效率，平均每天节约劳动力四百二十名。协作给路、港、船、货主等各方面带来了极大的好处。今年上半年，秦皇岛港口货物吞吐量比去年同期增加了182％；车站装卸量增加了近一倍；上海海运局的船只实行定线、定班的结果，使航次时间也提前了十几个小时，全年节约出的运力，等于增加了一只万吨轮船三十三天半的运力；铁路红旗直达列车也大大增加，旅行时间缩短了九小时。过去长时期流行的“车快损船快，船快损车快”的两极化的理论破产了，出现了互相促进、共同提高的局面。至于因为加速了车船周转对其他国民经济发生的影响，对于加速货物流转、节约国家流动资金所起的作用，更是一时难以估量的。可以想见，如果全国各地广泛地推广“一条龙”的经验，不仅包括铁路与海运，而且包括江运、河运、公路运输，那么，全国交通运输网就会出现许许多多的“一条龙”，各种运输工具将会密切衔接，充分发挥综合利用的效能，用最少的运输工具，提供量大、质好、安全、迅速、价廉的运力。这对于多快好省地建设社会主义，一定会起很大的作用。
    怎样才能搞好协作关系呢？最重要的关键是必须坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导。交通运输部门大协作的事实说明：政治挂帅、党的领导过去、现在和将来都是一切工作的灵魂。秦皇岛港、路双方由互相扯皮到亲密协作的过程，是一个鲜明的对照。在1957年整风运动以前，港、路双方主要是通过合同形式相互制约，当时对生产起了一定的促进作用。但是因为双方没有树立共产主义协作精神，在处理问题时常常以罚款相要挟，互相“将军”，有了困难互相推诿，有了缺点互相埋怨。有的问题争执半年未得解决，后来，中共秦皇岛市委加强了对路、港的领导，市委书记亲自挂帅，解决路、港之间的协作问题。双方党组织在干部和职工中进行细致的思想教育，依靠群众大鸣大放，大破本位主义，大立集体主义。今年年初又进行了“全国一盘棋”的教育，对本位主义思想进行了批判，使职工们树立了整体观念，结果面貌立即改观。“路港一家”已深入人心，“困难归自己，方便给别人”已形成风气，双方由互相抵消力量到拧成一股绳，共同实现了跃进。这个事实，雄辩地说明了坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，是搞好协作的基本保证。
    在组织交通运输部门之间的协作中，还必须坚定不移地大搞群众运动。秦皇岛和其他许多地区协作的事实证明群众运动是一个无往不胜的法宝，群众运动的轰轰烈烈，是正常的秩序，那种冷冷清清局面，才是不正常的秩序。秦皇岛实行“一条龙”大协作中，开展了内容丰富、形式多样的群众运动。在港口和船舶之间开展了以定线、定班协议为依据的港船协作大竞赛，互相提出保证条件。在铁路和港口之间，展开了比船期、比车点、比装卸车数、比作业量、比效率、比安全质量、比团结互助、比先进列车和先进船次的九比红旗竞赛。在铁路、港口、船舶等单位内部也开展了以加强协作、爱船、爱货、爱车等为重要内容的竞赛。在竞赛中发扬了先人后己、克己为人的共产主义精神。
    在群众运动的基础上，应当抓紧具体的组织工作，加强企业管理，这是保证协作关系巩固提高的一个重要环节。首先，应当建立恰当的组织形式。以组织机构、作业过程等方面的统一作保证，充分发掘双方潜力，加速车船货物的周转。第二，应当加强企业管理，建立必要的规章制度。在制定规章制度中，必须把职工的先进操作方法，纳入水陆联运的规章制度中去。第三，应当适应大协作的要求，进行运输生产组织的改革。例如简化技术作业过程，实行卸、排、装相结合、组织车船直接换装等等。第四，由于“一条龙”大协作环节多、关系复杂，还必须加强各部门间的联系，并且很好地掌握矿山、铁路和水运的月度计划的综合平衡工作，保证“一条龙”运输的顺利进行。
    全国交通运输战线的广大职工们：现在离伟大的建国十周年越来越近了，到年底还只有三个多月，立即动员起来！大兴协作之风！让更多的“赤龙”飞腾在我们祖国的交通战线上！让港口、铁路、工矿、海运、货主等各个部门之间同心协力，创造更出色的成就，来庆祝我们共和国的伟大的十周年吧！
