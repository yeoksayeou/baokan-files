Harvest on the Banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River
　　Our reporters Zhao Jialie and Luosang Yuexi
The Tagong area of Tibet, downstream of the Yarlung Zangbo River, is now in the season of celebrating the harvest.

The Tagong area is a region in the Tibetan Plateau with fertile land, a mild climate, and beautiful scenery. It has nearly 200,000 mu of cultivated land, planted with highland barley, wheat, rapeseed, peas, buckwheat, and potatoes. This year, the more than 100,000 mu of land belonging to the rebel elements will implement the policy of "whoever cultivates it, harvests it." The entire area is experiencing another year of bumper harvests, and everywhere you can see Tibetan farmers busily harvesting and joyfully singing.

One day after a night of heavy rain, we boarded a small yak-hide boat, rode the waves of the Nyang River, broke through the rapids of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and arrived at Kala Village in Milin County. Most of the land here belonged to the former Tibetan local government and the monasteries and nobles who participated in the rebellion. Three hundred and fifteen "ke" of seeds worth of land (each "ke" being approximately equivalent to one Chinese mu) were so-called "self-operated land" originally managed by the three major lords through corvée labor. The remaining five or six hundred "ke" of land were "cha land" and rented land that poor farmers rented from the lords. According to the policy of "whoever cultivates it, harvests it," the crops on these lands all belong to the more than fifty serf households and twenty or so domestic slaves who cultivated them. Currently, the crops are all ripe. The crops on the "self-operated land" are slightly worse, only comparable to previous years, yielding four to five times the amount of seeds. The crops cultivated by the farmers on the "cha land" and rented land are growing better than in previous years, generally yielding about ten times the amount of seeds per "ke." Whether the harvest is bountiful or just average, this year all the crops will be stored in the low huts of the poor farmers.

Now is the time when the rainy season on the Tibetan Plateau is about to end, with more sunny days and less rain. Farmers are seizing the sunshine to harvest and dry their crops and winnowing them in the breeze. In the fields, you can hear farmers singing harvest songs everywhere, and you can see them lightly clamping the stout ears of grain with two bamboo sticks (the local custom is to harvest the ears first and then cut the stalks), truly a joyful harvest scene. On the roads from the fields to the villages, mules, horses, and yaks with bells hanging from their necks carry baskets and crates full of ears of grain in an endless stream. In the villages, the low houses where poor farmers had never stored grain before are now piled high with ears of highland barley and wheat, and bundles of hay for winter feed hang from the rafters. The water mills are filled with the aroma of freshly ground barley flour all day long. The elderly people grinding the flour are excitedly talking about how in previous years, even after the harvest, the leather bags for storing grain were still empty, but this year, being able to eat their own new grain makes it taste especially sweet.

We arrived at Se’e Village, covered with peach and walnut trees. Lhamo, a former domestic slave of the rebellious serf owner Puba Tsering, and her husband Buchu were in the field threshing peas. As soon as they saw us, they said, "We have our own grain now. When we finish harvesting, we'll have sixty or seventy 'ke' (each 'ke' is 25.6 jin [approximately 12.8 kg])"

"Did you ever have this much in previous years?"

"Ah Xi Ah Yo! Never even one 'ke'."

Lhamo was abducted and sold to the vicious Puba Tsering as a lifelong slave when she was eight years old. For more than twenty years, she never received a single penny in wages, never ate the master's yak butter or meat, but was beaten and scolded countless times. Once, when the master tried to rape her and she resisted, he injured her waist with a stone, and she lay in bed for half a month before she could get up. This spring, this reactionary serf owner, who had killed nine people and injured or raped more than sixty, participated in the rebellion and became a prisoner of the People's Liberation Army. The crops from his two or three hundred 'ke' of land all belong to Lhamo and the other eleven former domestic slaves who cultivated it. In the days of being emancipated and celebrating the bumper harvest, Lhamo happily tells everyone she meets: "I have never harvested my own crops since I was born. The harvested grain was all taken by the master. This year I have freedom, I have grain, and my family of four has no worries about food. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are truly our saviors!"

In Demu Village, Linzhi County, a middle-aged woman named Baima enthusiastically invited us to see the good crops being harvested. One "ke" of this land can yield more than ten "ke" of highland barley. While constantly harvesting, she poured out her past sorrows and present joys to us like singing a song:

In the past I was like a small tree,
The nobles cut the branches with knives,
The monasteries chopped the trunk with axes,
The government dug up the roots with hoes;
The corvée labor was countless knives and axes,
Peeling the skin, cutting the branches until the trunk withered.

Now the government's policy is like a big tree,
With solid roots in the hearts of the poor,
The golden fruits cultivated by ourselves,
Fill the baskets and granaries.
The poor dance and sing around the big tree,
No one dares to cut the branches,
And no one dares to dig up the roots.
The kindness of the Communist Party—
Waters it to be evergreen for ten thousand years.

Baima said that since her family's older generation, they had cultivated six "cha land" belonging to the former Tibetan local government, and the fifty or sixty "ke" of grain harvested each year was not enough to pay for the corvée labor. In previous years, as soon as the grain was harvested, nobles, monasteries, and government officials would send people one after another to demand rent, press for debts, and forcibly impose corvée labor. The grain, jewelry, cattle, and anything of slight value were all used to offset the debts, but the debts still rolled over year after year. Over the past three or four decades, they have owed more than a thousand "ke" of grain, which can never be repaid. This year, after the rebellion was quelled, Baima and her husband Shangba Qupei had, for the first time in their lives, planned how to live a life of warm clothes and full stomachs. During these harvest days, the couple sang new songs of gratitude to the Communist Party while harvesting crops that yielded one-third more than in previous years.

After the implementation of democratic reforms, many new customs have emerged among the emancipated serfs. In the past, serfs had to harvest the serf owners' crops first before they could harvest their own "cha land" or rented land. This year, the vast majority of farmers are harvesting all the crops that belong to them for the first time according to the season, which has created a labor shortage. The village rebellion suppression and production committees or farmers' association groups have mobilized farmers to voluntarily form mutual aid harvesting teams, harvesting in rotation according to the different degrees of ripeness of the crops. The slaves who originally cultivated the serf owners' self-operated land are now collectively harvesting, sharing the fruits of their labor together, and helping each other settle down and solve living difficulties. Some emancipated slaves have even voluntarily given the crops they are entitled to harvest to other poor farmers. In Dannang Village, Milin County, twenty-two domestic slaves who originally belonged to the rebel Sangye Daojie cultivated more than three hundred "ke" of land this year under the "whoever cultivates it, harvests it" policy. When it was almost harvest time, they estimated that in previous years, Sangye Daojie relied on corvée labor to harvest these crops. This year, it would be impossible for them, just over twenty people, to harvest it all in the month and a half of the harvest season. Moreover, these three hundred "ke" of land could yield at least two thousand "ke" of grain, which they could not possibly eat in a year. After discussion, they decided to give away one-third of the crops for other poor farmers to harvest and use for themselves. The night we arrived at this village, the village rebellion suppression and production committee was leading more than fifty poor farmers, sitting around a large walnut tree, discussing how to harvest these crops.

    雅鲁藏布江畔的丰收
    本报记者　赵家烈　罗桑悦西
    雅鲁藏布江下游的西藏塔工地区，现在正是欢庆丰收的季节。
    塔工地区是西藏高原土地富饶、气候温和、风景优美的地区，有近二十万亩耕地，种植着青稞、小麦、油菜、豌豆、荞麦和马铃薯等农作物。这里有十多万亩土地是叛乱分子的，今年将实行“谁种谁收”的政策。全区又是丰收的年景，到处都可以见到藏族农民忙碌收获和愉快高歌的欢乐景象。
    一个夜雨骤晴的日子，我们坐上牛皮小船，乘着尼洋河的浪头，划破雅鲁藏布江的激流，来到了密林县卡拉村。这里绝大部分土地是原西藏地方政府和参加叛乱的寺庙、贵族的，有三百十五克种籽的地（每克地约合一市亩）是原来由三大领主派乌拉差役经营的所谓“自营地”，其余五、六百克地是贫苦农民向领主租种的差地和租地。根据“谁种谁收”的政策，这些土地上的庄稼全部属于耕种这些土地的五十多户农奴和二十多个家奴所有。目前庄稼都已黄熟，“自营地”的庄稼稍差些，只能抵得上往年，能收种籽的四、五倍。农民经营的差地、租地，庄稼都长得比往年好，一般每克地能收种籽的十倍左右。不管丰收还是平收的庄稼，今年将全部收进贫苦农民低矮的小屋。
    现在正是西藏高原雨季将过，晴多雨少的时候，农民们趁着阳光抢收、曝晒，迎着微风扬场。田野里，到处可以听到农民唱着丰收的歌曲，看到他们轻快地用两条竹棍夹下硕壮的穗子（这里的习惯是先收穗头后割麦秆），真是一片欢乐的丰收景象。田野通往村庄的道路上，挂着铃当的骡、马和驮牛，驮着满筐满箩的穗子，络绎不绝。在村庄里，贫苦农民从来没有放过粮食的低矮房屋里，也堆上了青稞和小麦穗子，屋架上挂着一束束作为冬饲料的干草。水磨坊里，更是整天弥漫着碾磨新?耙面的香气。磨面的老年人们，兴致勃勃地谈论着：往年收了庄稼，装粮食的皮口袋还是空的；今年能吃上自己的新粮食，就觉得格外香甜。
    我们来到了桃树和胡桃树覆盖下的色俄村。原是叛乱农奴主普巴泽仁的家奴拉姆和她的丈夫布楚，正在场上翻打豌豆，一见我们就说：“我们有了自己的粮食了，全部收打完有六、七十克（每克二十五点六斤）”。
    “往年有过这么多吗？”
    “啊兮啊哟！一克也没有过。”
    拉姆八岁时就被人拐骗卖给狠毒的普巴泽仁作终身奴隶，二十多年来，工资分文未给，也从没吃过一次主人的酥油和肉食，挨打受骂的次数却数不清。有一次主人想强奸她遭到反抗，便用石头砸伤了她的腰，她躺了半个月才爬起来。今年春天，这个杀死九个人，打伤、强奸六十多人的反动农奴主参加了叛乱，成了解放军的俘虏，他的二、三百克地里的庄稼，也全部归于耕种这些土地的拉姆等十一个原来的家奴所有。在翻身、丰收双喜的日子里，拉姆高兴得逢人便说：“从生下地来就没有收过自己的庄稼，收的粮食都被主人拿去了。今年我有了自由，有了粮食，一家四口不愁吃了。毛主席、共产党真是我们的救命恩人！”
    在林芝县的德木村，一个中年妇女白玛热情地招呼我们去看正在收获的好庄稼。这一片庄稼，一克地能收十多克青稞。她一面不停地收获，一面像唱歌一样地对我们倾吐着过去的悲痛和今天的欢乐：
    过去我好比一株小树，
    贵族用刀砍树枝，
    寺庙用斧劈树身，
    官府拿锄挖树根；
    乌拉差役是数不清的刀斧，
    剥皮割枝直到树干枯。
    现在政府的政策像大树一样，
    在穷人心中扎下了牢固的根，
    自己耕种的黄金果，
    装得满箩满囤。
    穷苦人围着大树歌舞，
    没有谁敢来砍枝，
    更没有谁敢来挖根。
    共产党的恩情——
    浇灌着它万年常青。
    白玛说，从她家老一辈人起，耕种着原西藏地方政府的六块差地，每年打下来的五、六十克粮食还不够支付乌拉差役。往年粮食刚收下，贵族、寺庙和官府就一个接一个地派人来索租逼债，强派乌拉差役。粮食、手饰、耕牛和稍值点钱的东西都抵债抵光了，债务仍在年年往上翻滚，到现在的三、四十年间，共欠了粮食一千多克，永远也还不清了。今年，当平息叛乱后，白玛和她的丈夫尚巴·确才有生以来第一次筹划了如何过一下暖衣饱食的生活。在收获的这些日子，夫妻俩一面收割着比往年增产三分之一的庄稼，一面唱出了感激共产党的新歌。
    实行民主改革后，在翻身农奴中出现了许多新的风尚。过去，农奴必须先收获农奴主的庄稼，然后才能在自己的差地或租地上收获。今年，广大农民都第一次按照季节收获所有属于自己的庄稼，发生了劳动力不足的困难。各村平叛生产委员会或农民协会小组，就发动农民自愿结合组成互助收获小组，根据庄稼黄熟的不同程度轮流收获。原来耕种农奴主自营地的奴隶们，现在正集体收获，共同分摊劳动果实，并互相帮助安家，解决生活困难。有些翻身奴隶，还把应得而收不了的庄稼，主动让给其他一些贫苦农民收获。密林县的旦娘村，原属叛乱分子桑杰刀杰的二十二个家奴，今年种了三百多克“谁种谁收”的土地。临收获时，他们估算了一下：往年这些庄稼，桑杰刀杰是靠派乌拉来收获的。而今年，他们二十多个人在一个半月的收获季节里，无论如何也收不完；而且这三百多克地最少能收二千多克粮食，一年怎么也吃不了。他们经过商量，决定让出三分之一的庄稼，给其他贫苦农民收获自用。我们到这个村的那天晚上，村平叛生产委员会正领导着五十多个贫苦农民，围坐在一株大胡桃树下，讨论如何收打这些庄稼。
