Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th: According to TASS, Washington, 27th: During his visit to the United States, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, received a large number of letters and telegrams from American citizens and groups every day. In these goodwill letters and telegrams, the American people welcomed the mutual visits of Khrushchev and Eisenhower, and expressed their support for the actions of the head of the Soviet government aimed at improving Soviet-American relations and ending the Cold War.

The Seattle branch of the Committee for Non-Violent Action cabled: "Our organization has long called for complete disarmament, and we therefore wholeheartedly support your disarmament proposals made at the United Nations on September 18, 1959. In view of the current tensions between our two countries and the danger of nuclear war, we have in the past and continue to call for easing these tensions. We assure you of our determination to support all efforts aimed at ensuring world peace."

A telegram from Remais in San Francisco said: "I fully support your (Khrushchev's) proposal for complete disarmament. You have strengthened the hope of all people for peace. War must be eliminated from social life."

A telegram from Hamilton, Chairman of the Peace Committee, in Victoria said: "We express our deep gratitude for your frank and elegant speeches in our country. We have sent a telegram with the signatures of two hundred and twenty-five Victoria residents to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting support for your disarmament proposal."

Ms. Gray said in a telegram from Maryland that all American mothers listened attentively to your words, and your words entered their hearts. We wish your efforts success. We American mothers, for our part, will ensure that we make every effort to strive for peace and for mutual understanding between our two countries. Ms. Douglas (New York) said in a telegram:
	“My children have just gone to sleep, and I am taking the time to send you a telegram. I appeal to you and the President because the future depends on the two of you. Please eliminate the threat of war and create a future where all children, regardless of race, color, and creed, can live happily in a peaceful environment."

Ewing, Director of the Detroit Institute of Arts, said in a telegram: "I listened with great interest to your proposals for peaceful coexistence and cultural exchange between our two countries. Your suggestions give us great hope."

Biel, a worker in New York, wrote in a letter: "I am an ordinary American worker. I am very happy that you are visiting our country. I know that your visit is a mission of peace."
	“The whole world should welcome the Soviet Union's plan for complete disarmament. People of all countries should be friendly and trust each other. Please persuade our President that the American military bases built around the Soviet Union must be dismantled, and the flights of military aircraft over the Soviet border must be stopped… You say that your system surpasses the American system in terms of production in all sectors, and I believe that. How good is the idea of competing with each other to improve life! American workers welcome your noble mission to visit our country."

A telegram from a female student in Pennsylvania said: "I am studying in the fifth grade. My classmates and I very, very much hope to see you at our school... We love you very much. We love your Russian children very much."

Williams of Pennsylvania wrote: "I am not an important person. I have eight grandchildren, and I am deeply concerned about taking a new approach to ending the 'Cold War'. I believe your visit will help achieve this goal."

A group of American social figures wrote in a telegram: "Those who oppose your mutual visits with President Eisenhower are in the absolute minority in our country. The trend of improving relations between our two countries frightens them. They need the Cold War and its dangerous consequences. But for the majority of Americans, your mutual visits with President Eisenhower are a great hope for improving relations between our two countries. We yearn for peace and for the establishment of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the United States."

    表达善意与愿望  表示欢迎和支持
    美国人民大批函电寄给赫鲁晓夫
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿27日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在访问美国期间每天都收到美国公民和团体的大批来信和电报。美国人民在这些善意的信件和电报中表示欢迎赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的相互访问，并表示支持苏联政府首脑目的在于改善苏美关系和停止冷战的行动。
    争取和解协会西雅图分会在电报中说，“我们这个组织长期以来一直呼吁全面裁军，因此我们衷心支持您在1959年9月18日在联合国提出的裁军建议。鉴于我们两国之间当前的紧张关系和核战争的危险，我们过去和现在一直要求缓和这种紧张关系。我们向您保证，我们决心支持目的在于保障世界和平的一切努力。”
    雷迈兹发自旧金山的电报中说：“我完全赞成您（赫鲁晓夫）的全面裁军建议。您加强了所有的人对和平的希望。必须从社会生活中排除战争。”
    和平委员会主席汉密尔顿发自维多利亚的电报中说：“我们对您在我国发表的坦率而幽雅的演说表示深深的谢意。我们已把有二百二十五位维多利亚居民签名的电报发给联合国秘书长，要求支持您的裁军建议。”
    格雷女士在从马里兰发来的电报说，所有美国母亲都注意地倾听了您的话，您的话印入了她们的心。我们祝您的努力获得成功。我们美国母亲从自己方面来说，将保证尽一切努力争取和平，争取在我们两国之间达成相互谅解。道格拉斯女士（纽约州）在电报中说：
  “我的孩子刚刚睡觉，我抽空给您拍电报。我呼吁您和总统，是因为未来取决于您们二位。请你们消除战争威胁，创造这样的未来，让所有的孩子不分种族、肤色和信仰都在和平环境中过幸福的生活。”
    底特律造型艺术博物馆馆长艾温在电报中说，“我极感兴趣地倾听了您提出的关于我们两国和平共处和文化交流的建议。您的建议使我们产生巨大希望。”
    纽约工人比耶尔在信中写道，“我是一个普通的美国工人。我非常高兴您到我国访问。我知道，您的访问是一个和平使命。”
  “全世界都应当欢迎苏联的全面裁军计划。世界各国人们应该互相友好和信任。请您劝说我国总统，必须撤除美国在苏联四周所建筑的军事基地，停止军用飞机在苏联边界上空的飞行……您说，你们的制度在各部门的生产方面胜过美国的制度，我相信这一点。互相竞赛，把生活改善得更好，这种思想多么好！美国工人欢迎您到我国访问的崇高使命。”
    宾夕法尼亚州的一个女学生的电报中说：“我在五年级学习。我和我的同学非常非常希望在我们学校看到您……我们非常爱您。我们非常爱你们俄国的儿童”。
    宾夕法尼亚州的威廉斯写道：“我不是重要人物。我有八个孙子，我深切关心对结束‘冷战’采取新的态度。我相信您的访问将有助于达到这个目标。”
    一批美国社会人士在电报中写道，“反对您同艾森豪威尔总统互相访问的人，在我国占绝对少数。我们两国关系的改善趋向使他们感到恐惧。他们需要冷战及其危险后果。但是，对于多数美国人来讲，您同艾森豪威尔总统的互相访问，是改善我们两国关系的伟大希望。我们渴望和平，渴望苏联和美国建立友好关系。”
