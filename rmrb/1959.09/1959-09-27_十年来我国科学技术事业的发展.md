The Glorious Ten Years

    The Development of Science and Technology in Our Country Over the Past Decade
    Nie Rongzhen

    In 1949, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, achieved a revolutionary victory of great world significance. A great nation with a history of five thousand years and a quarter of the world's population shattered the shackles of feudalism and broke free from the iron chains of imperialism, embarking on the bright and glorious path of socialism. The Chinese people are determined to build their motherland into a strong socialist country. Over the past decade, they have carried out a great socialist revolution and socialist construction, achieving decisive victories in the socialist revolution and brilliant achievements in socialist construction. Especially after the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," China's socialist construction has advanced at an unprecedented speed.

    Science and technology, which occupy an extremely important position in socialist construction, have also made rapid progress and undergone a new transformation. Developing science and technology is an important component of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, and it is necessary for building modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern national defense. It is an indispensable condition for building our country into a strong socialist power. We are determined to make our country's science and technology catch up with the world's most advanced levels as quickly as possible. Since the foundation of science and technology in our country is very weak, this is an extremely arduous task. However, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of the Chinese people. The great achievements and experiences of science and technology over the past decade encourage us, and we are advancing towards this goal with full confidence.

  Ten Years Have Laid a Solid Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology

    In the old China, which was semi-feudal and semi-colonial, the productive forces could not be developed, and modern science and technology were therefore very backward. By the time of liberation, there were only about forty science and technology research units, with only a few hundred people specializing in scientific and technological research and experimentation. Scientific and technological work lacked basic housing equipment and instruments, and funding was extremely meager. At that time, only those disciplines related to regional investigations, such as geology and biology, and theoretical disciplines such as mathematics, which could be carried out without relying on modern experimental equipment, could develop somewhat. Moreover, these developments mainly relied on the efforts of the scientists themselves. Some newly developed science and technology departments and research and experimental work that required slightly more equipment and funding were completely unable to proceed. Many upright scientists, although they had good wishes to develop Chinese science and technology, were constantly frustrated and devastated under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, unable to carry out their work. The reactionary rulers of old China, who were dependent on imperialism, had no intention of developing production, and therefore had no need to develop their own science and technology. Therefore, generally speaking, scientific research at that time was divorced from production, and theory was divorced from practice, let alone the purpose of science serving the people. In old China, scientific and technological work simply could not take root and develop. Scientists were consciously or unconsciously dominated by bourgeois idealistic views, and the idea of "science for science's sake" was widespread.

    On such a poor and backward basis, after ten years of arduous efforts, especially the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the development of China's science and technology and its ranks has been astonishing. By the end of 1958, there were more than 840 specialized natural science and technology research institutions nationwide, twenty times more than at the time of liberation; the number of scientific and technical personnel working in these institutions was fifty times more than at the time of liberation. Among them, the Chinese Academy of Sciences directly under the scientific and technological research institutions ninety-one; the central professional departments have their own research and experimental institutions in various industries; all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the country, except Tibet, have established regional branches of the Academy of Sciences and some research institutions that meet local needs. The majority of teachers in universities and colleges across the country also carried out scientific research. Many large and small industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes across the country carried out mass scientific and technological activities and established countless research and experimental organizations. The organization and members of the China Association for Science and Technology are spread throughout urban and rural areas. Among hundreds of millions of people across the country, due to the needs of socialist construction, an upsurge of loving science, studying technology, and marching towards science has begun to take shape. The political consciousness of scientific and technological personnel has greatly improved, and their academic level has greatly progressed.

    The current state of science and technology in our country is: First, while learning and mastering advanced scientific and technological achievements from abroad, we have begun to carry out a large number of creative research work. We must combine our specific conditions and strengthen research work so that modern science and technology can take root, develop, and bear fruit in our country. Second, through production and construction and scientific and technological investigations and research, we have accumulated a large amount of data on natural resources and natural conditions, as well as data obtained from practice in various aspects such as industrial and agricultural production and medical and health care, laying the foundation for further scientific and technological research. Third, we have excavated a large amount of scientific and technological heritage scattered among the people and in the classics, such as traditional technologies in agriculture, medicine, meteorology, smelting, and light industry, and have begun to organize and study them. After analyzing and studying these traditional theories and technologies and raising them to the level of modern science, they will provide new clues for the development of each discipline and may make important contributions. Fourth, we have filled many gaps in disciplines. In the past, many missing fields are now able to carry out research and experimental work. For example, jet technology, computing technology, radio astronomy, petrochemicals, and biophysics all had no foundation in old China. After several years of efforts, and with the strong help of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, corresponding bases have been initially established and some cadres have been trained, and research work has been carried out.

    With the necessary science and technology teams and a relatively solid working foundation, China's science and technology will surely leap forward more rapidly in the future.

            Three Stages of Scientific and Technological Development in Our Country

    The development of science and technology in our country has advanced along with the pace of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Over the past decade, the development process of science and technology can be roughly divided into the following three stages:

    From the founding of the People's Republic of China to 1956, was the first stage of scientific and technological development. With the founding of New China, we began to carry out the organizational construction and ideological construction of science and technology institutions. We took over the original Academia Sinica, the Peiping Research Institute, and their affiliated institutions, and established the Chinese Academy of Sciences in November 1949. The industrial departments also took over relevant research and experimental institutions. The organization and ranks of science and technology were greatly developed after rectification. We adjusted and supplemented the science and technology research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various business departments, and trained cadres through work. We reformed China's scientific and technological education and trained a large number of new forces in science and technology through teaching reform and the adjustment of departments and faculties. We implemented the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and helped scientific and technological personnel carry out self-transformation. Scientific and technological personnel participated in social reform movements such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance against the United States and aid to Korea, the three-anti campaign, and ideological reform studies, learned the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, learned from the advanced scientific and technological experiences and achievements of the Soviet Union, criticized bourgeois idealistic views, and carried out criticism and self-criticism on the basis of learning. Their ideological level and political consciousness were greatly improved. Through participating in national construction and engaging in scientific and technological work, scientific and technological personnel personally experienced that the socialist system provides the broadest space for the development of science and technology, and also most needs the development of science and technology. While carrying out ideological construction and organizational construction, we carried out work that was linked to reality and served production and construction. At that time, it was the period of the three-year national economic recovery and the early stage of the First Five-Year Plan. The backbone major construction projects in the First Five-Year Plan were mostly designed and assisted by the Soviet Union, which provided us with the most advanced and comprehensive technical assistance. China's science and technology work, while striving to learn and master the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, carried out resource surveys, exploration, and cooperation in design and research and experimentation. Theoretical science also developed somewhat on the original basis. In general, scientific and technological work during this period was relatively scattered, and there was relatively little creative research work.

    From the Intellectuals Issue Conference held by the Party Central Committee in 1956 to 1958, was the second stage of scientific and technological development. In January 1956, when the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce entered a climax, the Party Central Committee convened a conference on the intellectuals issue, issuing a call to march towards science. It put forward the requirement to catch up with or approach the world's advanced scientific and technological levels in the most important and urgently needed departments within twelve years. This great call pointed out the prospects for the development of science and technology in our country, and played a great role in science and technology work. In May of the same year, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in science and literature, and academic activities were greatly developed and academic ideas became active. According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, in 1956, under the ideological guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's "overall planning and strengthening leadership," the State Council established the Science Planning Commission, organized more than 600 scientific and technological experts across the country, and formulated a twelve-year science and technology development plan for our country. Since then, China's science and technology has had a long-term and comprehensive plan, which is a major event in the history of science and technology in our country. At that time, the First Five-Year Plan was nearing completion, and the state had begun to compile the Second Five-Year Plan, so it was possible to more comprehensively concentrate the requirements of China's socialist construction for science and technology; we also systematically analyzed and studied the advanced levels and development trends of world science and technology, and made appropriate evaluations of the existing level and strength of science and technology in our country. These tasks made it possible for us to comprehensively and scientifically draw up a long-term scientific and technological development plan. This plan embodied the Party and the state's policies on developing science and technology and the needs of socialist construction, pointed out the direction of science and technology development in our country, made comprehensive arrangements for current and long-term tasks, theoretical and practical tasks, and key and general tasks as much as possible, and proposed measures such as talent training and base construction needed to achieve the plan. Three years of practice have proved that this long-term plan has played a guiding role in the annual science and technology plans and the research work of science and technology institutions and universities across the country, and has also promoted the improvement of the technical level of various departments of the national economy. It has also provided a basis for the establishment and strengthening of blank and weak science and technology departments, the establishment of university majors, talent training, and the construction of research bases. In 1957, the Party sent a large number of outstanding cadres to the science and technology front, strengthening leadership over science and technology work. Since then, we have formulated national annual science and technology plans, coordinated arrangements nationwide, organized the forces of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, industrial departments, and universities, strengthened coordination, and cooperated with each other. China's science and technology work began to advance rapidly in a planned manner on a national scale.

    Scientific and technological workers and the people of the whole country, like the whole nation, experienced an extraordinary summer in 1957, namely the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle. This socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has had extremely profound significance for the development of science and technology. A great debate on the direction and path of scientific and technological development was conducted within the science and technology community. The essence of this debate was to solve the question of whether science and technology should take the socialist road or the capitalist road. At that time, bourgeois rightists launched a wild attack on the Party, attempting to usurp the Party's leadership over science and technology and let science and technology leave the socialist track. They put forward a complete set of anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific work programs. They attacked the Party's leadership over science and technology, clamoring that "laymen cannot lead experts." They advocated "science for science's sake," negating the sacred task of science serving socialist construction. They opposed the planned nature of science and technology, advocating that work should be carried out entirely according to personal interests, in a decentralized and blind manner. The rightists attempted to use certain weaknesses of intellectuals to lead them astray, thereby undermining our socialist science and technology. However, their conspiracy was completely defeated. Under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of scientific and technological workers resolutely crushed the attack of the rightists, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and improved their understanding. In the struggle between the two roads, the socialist road won the heartfelt support of the vast majority of scientific and technological personnel. In this way, the Party's leadership was more firmly established in scientific and technological work. This is the fundamental issue for the development of science and technology in our country. The solution of this issue provided the most fundamental guarantee for the rapid development of science and technology in our country.

    Beginning in 1958, was the third stage of scientific and technological development. The rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle raised the socialist consciousness of the vast number of cadres and masses, stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of cadres and masses, and brought about a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in production and construction, cultural education, science and technology, and all other undertakings . The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party formulated the general line of "going all-in, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and put forward the great tasks of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. It determined a whole set of policies of walking on two legs, such as giving priority to the development of heavy industry, simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously developing indigenous methods of production and foreign methods of production. In this way, a climax of a comprehensive Great Leap Forward was launched among the 600 million people of our country. Driven by the high tide of industrial and agricultural production, the mass technical revolution movement surged forward with the force of a landslide.

    In the past, in science and technology work, many people had ideas of superstitious foreign countries and blindly worshiping authorities, which bound people's minds and prevented them from boldly researching and boldly creating. Many people thought that science and technology were out of reach and did not dare to ask questions. Many people emphasized the specialization of science and technology, did not believe in the masses, and did not recognize the importance of practice for science and technology. Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the call to liberate the mind and break superstitions, and put forward the promotion of the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, which eliminated people's inferiority complex and inspired people's wisdom. Science and technology work began to carry out mass movements on a large scale, implement the mass line, and many tasks that people had not dared to start in the past many years began and achieved results. Many new technologies that many old experts thought were difficult to achieve were mastered by young people. Many things that many scientists and engineers could not do in the past were also done by workers and peasants. A large number of inventions and creations appeared in various industries such as industry, mining, agriculture, and forestry. After the tempering of the rectification and anti-rightist struggles, the enthusiasm of many experts and scholars was greatly improved. Some of the work that was originally scheduled to take three to five years to complete was completed in one year, and many achievements were made. The atmosphere of close integration between intellectuals and working people has greatly developed. Experts and scholars should have been members of the masses. As long as they treat themselves as ordinary workers, go to the working people, and attach importance to and learn from the practical experience of the masses, they can draw many valuable things from the wisdom of the masses and analyze and study these experiences to enrich the content of science and technology. Scientists must truly establish the mass viewpoint and serve the masses wholeheartedly. Doing so is not only necessary for ideological transformation, but also necessary for improving the level of science. As long as scientists can consciously integrate with the masses, the more deeply the mass line is implemented in scientific and technological work, the more the role of scientists can be brought into play.

    The mass line working method, which has been effective in our Party's long-term revolutionary struggle, has demonstrated its power on all fronts of socialist construction. For more than a year, the mass agricultural Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, the mass movement to run iron and steel on a large scale, the mass movement to build water conservancy projects, the mass technical innovation movement, and mass movements in various undertakings have all promoted the rapid development of science and technology. In science and technology work, the mass line was implemented, and the policy of simultaneously developing the central government and local governments, simultaneously developing indigenous and foreign methods, combining professional scientific and technological research institutions with mass technical revolution activities, combining popularization and improvement, and combining production, teaching, and scientific research was put forward. It swept away the bleak situation of the past and began to form an exciting situation in which the entire party and the entire people marched towards science and technology. The flowers of science and technology are colorful and bloom all over the motherland. Science and technology work has taken a big step in realizing the great tasks of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution.

    The practice of these ten years has proved that only under the leadership of the Party can the high-speed development of science and technology be realized. It proves that the Party not only victoriously leads us in class struggle, but also victoriously leads us in the struggle with nature, developing productive forces, and developing science and technology. The Party put forward the general line of building socialism and the great tasks of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. The Party put forward the call for China's science and technology to catch up with the world's advanced level within twelve years, pointed out the direction, path, and development direction of science and technology work, and led us to formulate a magnificent long-term plan for science and technology development. The Party put forward the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, helped scientific and technological personnel study Marxism-Leninism, applied the ideological method of dialectical materialism in scientific and technological research, and trained a large number of new-type intellectuals. The Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." The Party issued a call to break superstitions and liberate the mind, and taught us to implement the mass line working method in science and technology work.

    Under the leadership of the Party, with dialectical materialism as the ideological guide, starting from the tasks of socialist construction, comprehensively planning, strengthening cooperation, implementing the mass line and the policy of walking on two legs, carrying out science and technology work, and building a scientific and technological team that is both red and expert. This is the most important and basic experience of the brilliant achievements of science and technology work in the past decade.

        The Great Leap Forward in Science and Technology is a Great Victory of the General Line

    The Great Leap Forward in science and technology since 1958 is the result of implementing the Party's general line of building socialism in science and technology work, and it is a great victory of the general line. Since then, we have explored a path for accelerating the development of science and technology in our country. We must adhere to this path, strive to get rid of the backward state of science and technology in our country more quickly, and quickly catch up with the world's advanced level.

    The achievements since the Great Leap Forward are objective facts that no one can deny. However, due to the different positions and viewpoints of people, there are still different views on the great achievements of this mass movement. The majority of people believe that we have changed the situation of a few people engaging in research in a cold and deserted manner in 1958, created many new methods and experiences, and achieved a bumper harvest in science and technology. However, there are also some people with strong bourgeois ideas in the science and technology community who are making comments from the sidelines, saying that this is not good and that is not good. They cannot get used to the vigorous mass movement, and think that this has disrupted the routine of scientific work. They think that young people and worker-peasant innovators cannot do any scientific and technological research work; they say, "It's better to take the old road." They exaggerate certain shortcomings brought about by victorious development, saying that our science and technology work "has developed in quantity, but has not improved in quality," saying: "The work of serving production has progressed, but there has been no harvest in theory." There are not many people who adhere to these erroneous views; however, some people still have some confused ideas on this or that issue. Therefore, it is necessary to refute these erroneous views.

    In science and technology work, breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, and implementing the mass line are inseparable. Science and technology are the crystallization of human labor in the struggle for production, material production, and scientific experiments. If we firmly believe that science is created by labor, then we will inevitably attach importance to the practice of the masses in the struggle for production and the experience in practice. Under the socialist system, to develop the productive forces and carry out the struggle for production, we must carry out mass movements on a large scale. This truth has been confirmed in the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. Before the Great Leap Forward, many people doubted whether or not to carry out mass movements on a large scale in science and technology work. After the practice since 1958, it has been proved that science and technology work, like the struggle for production, can not only carry out mass movements, but must carry out mass movements. The workers and peasants are in close contact with reality and encounter many practical problems in production. They also have rich production experience. When they solve these problems, valuable sprouts of scientific and technological development often appear. Therefore, science and technology work must go to the masses and go to production. At the same time, even in scientific and technological research institutions, mass movements must be carried out on a large scale, and all forces must be fully mobilized to carry out work. Many research institutes carried out mass movements on a large scale last year, and the research results in one year exceeded the past few years, which is a very good example.

    Since last year, we have established many research institutions, expanded the ranks of researchers, and mobilized the vast number of workers and peasants to participate in scientific and technological work such as investigation, research, and experimentation. The number of research topics has doubled. Although there has been such a large development, the scientific and technological forces are still not able to meet the needs of a large country with a high speed of construction, especially a poor and blank one.

    Our country is an economically and technologically backward country, and at the same time it is an economically and technologically very complex country. We have both modern machine production and a large amount of heavy manual labor; we have both agricultural tractors and a large amount of manual labor; we have modern means of transportation such as automobiles and airplanes, and at the same time we rely on a large amount of carrying on our shoulders and backs to transport goods. We must complete the road of industrial revolution that capitalist countries have experienced for one or two hundred years in a relatively short period of time, and gradually transfer the national economy from a backward technology to an advanced technological basis. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a large amount of various scientific and technological work. Some of these tasks, if measured by the level of modern science and technology, may not be new topics, but as long as they are beneficial to production and construction and beneficial to improving labor productivity, we should attach importance to them, conduct research, and vigorously promote them.

    At present, we are also in an era of rapid advances in science and technology. We must master many emerging sciences and technologies, such as atomic energy, jet technology, computing technology, and radio electronics, as soon as possible, so as to quickly catch up with the world's advanced level and serve economic construction and national defense construction.

    Our country is also a large country, and various conditions such as natural, social, economic, and cultural conditions vary greatly from place to place. Many scientific and technological tasks must be combined with regional characteristics. The foundation of modern science and technology left to us by old China is very weak, and for some disciplines, it is even completely blank and urgently needs to be filled and developed. Therefore, in all regions and departments, there must be corresponding scientific and technological forces in order to closely combine the actual conditions of each department and each region and carry out scientific and technological research work.

    Therefore, we must carry out a large amount of multifaceted research work in order to adapt to the needs of production and construction with complex content. If we do not have enough institutions and manpower, and do not have the working methods of the mass line, we will not be able to undertake such complex and numerous tasks.

    From the perspective of scientific and technological work itself, it is difficult to improve quality without a certain amount of work. Without a large amount of data from meteorological stations, it is impossible to improve the theoretical level of meteorological science. Without a large-scale geological survey, it is difficult to explore the laws of mineralization. Moreover, these tasks are essential for solving current practical problems and cultivating young cadres' ability to work independently. As for some tasks, they are currently in a stage of advancement or have just begun, and more detailed and in-depth work needs to be done in the next step. For example, most of the topics that have achieved certain results last year are continuing to do in-depth research, systematically sorting out data and summarizing experience this year. A good start is half the battle, so what reason is there to criticize this half of the success?

    At the same time, since the Great Leap Forward last year, not only has the quantity greatly developed, but the quality has also greatly improved. On the one hand, many new tasks have been pioneered from scratch last year, which is an improvement for our entire scientific and technological work itself. On the other hand, the work that has been carried out in the past has also greatly improved on the original basis since last year. Not to mention the improvement in the quality of our science and technology team.

    It is right to say that we have carried out the work of serving production. It is wrong to say that there is no harvest in theory. Last year was also the year in which theoretical research work developed the fastest in our country, and academic papers had a bumper harvest. For example, the number of words published in academic journals sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the various natural science specialized societies under the National Association for Science and Technology increased by 47% in 1958 compared to 1957; and increased by twenty-one times compared to 1952. This is the most convincing statistic. Of course, some of these tasks were done last year, and some were done before last year, but without the Great Leap Forward, so many theoretical achievements could not be summarized. Last year alone, the number of textbooks edited and published by universities and colleges has also increased greatly. The Higher Education Press alone has already published more than 200 kinds, which is about four times that of 1957, and the content has also added many theories summarized from China's reality. Can this not be said to be a leap forward in theoretical work? Is it not obvious that practice promotes theoretical research? Since many theoretical tasks last year were a summary of research and experimental work done in the previous year, the year before that, or three or five years ago, why are we not allowed to wait until this year, next year, or the year after that to make a theoretical summary of the research and experimental work done last year? Generally speaking, it is not possible to make achievements in theory in scientific research work in a short period of time. It is completely understandable that the research results in last year's Great Leap Forward have not had time to make a full theoretical summary.

    In the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, scientific and technological personnel and the broad masses of working people in our country have done a lot of basic work, and collected and accumulated a large amount of investigation, observation, and research experiment data. On the basis of these tasks, we can and will inevitably make significant contributions in theory.

    Many theoretical problems are raised from the practice of production and construction, and scientific and technological research personnel are required to solve them. For example, reasonable deep plowing and close planting have extremely significant effects on increasing agricultural production. We need to further summarize its laws on the basis of a large number of practical achievements. The utilization coefficient of iron-smelting blast furnaces is very high. We need to develop the theory of iron-smelting technology. The curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture is completely certain. We need to further explore its theory. We must attach enough importance to theoretical work, correctly implement the policy of linking theory with practice, and resolutely oppose the separation of theory from practice.

    In short, since the Great Leap Forward in science and technology since 1958, the road has been completely correct and the achievements have been great. Breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale are the revolutionary routines of science and technology work. Since the Great Leap Forward, not only has the quantity greatly developed, but the quality has also greatly improved; not only has it achieved great achievements in serving production, but theoretical research work has also gained a lot. Any doubts about the achievements of the Great Leap Forward are completely unfounded.

    Not long ago, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party called on the whole Party and the people of the whole country to oppose right-leaning and encourage hard work, and to strive to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year. This battle command has launched a vigorous mass movement to increase production and save money among the people of the whole country. The slanders and attacks of hostile elements at home and abroad are all in vain, and the wavering and doubts of right-leaning opportunism have been submerged by the surging tide of the mass movement. We must conscientiously study and understand the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, correctly understand the great significance of the Great Leap Forward, launch a new upsurge on the basis of the great victories that have been achieved, and advance victoriously.

                            ＊　＊　＊　＊

    The People's New China has spent a glorious decade. The achievements of science and technology in our country in the past decade have been enormous, and science and technology have laid a good foundation. The leaping socialist construction requires science and technology in our country to have greater and faster development in the next decade.

    In the next decade, we will completely change the backward state of science and technology in China, complete the twelve-year science and technology development plan ahead of schedule, and catch up with the world's advanced level as soon as possible. A large number of young scientific and technological workers will continue to grow and mature, and more worker-peasant innovators will participate in scientific and technological research and development work. Our scientists will make more contributions in the future, and we will have a more powerful scientific and technological team that is both red and expert. Science and technology work will play a greater role in building a strong socialist country.

    Let us bravely advance under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for building socialism! Let us greet the beginning of the next decade of the motherland with even more brilliant achievements!

    十年来我国科学技术事业的发展
    聂荣臻
    1949年，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，取得了具有伟大世界意义的革命的胜利。一个具有五千年悠久历史和拥有世界人口四分之一的大国，从此粉碎了封建主义的枷锁，挣脱了帝国主义的铁链，踏上了光明灿烂的社会主义的大道。中国人民决心把自己的祖国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家，十年来，进行了伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利和社会主义建设的辉煌成就。特别是在党中央和毛泽东同志提出“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线之后，我国社会主义建设事业更以空前的速度向前跃进。
    在社会主义建设中占有极其重要地位的科学技术事业，也是突飞猛进、面貌一新。发展科学技术是技术革命和文化革命的重要组成部分，是建设现代化工业、现代化农业和现代化国防所必需的。是使我国建成社会主义强国的一个不可缺少的条件。我们决心要使我国科学技术迅速地赶上世界最先进的水平，由于我国科学技术的基础十分薄弱，这是一个极其艰巨的任务。但是，在中国人民面前没有不能克服的困难。十年来科学技术的巨大成就和经验鼓舞着我们，我们正满怀信心，向这个目标前进。
  十年来已为科学技术事业发展打下了巩固的基础
    在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，生产力得不到发展，近代的科学技术因而也很落后。到解放时为止，科学技术研究单位只有四十个上下，专门从事科学技术研究试验的人员仅几百人。科学技术工作缺乏起码的房屋设备和仪器，经费极端微薄。那时，只是同地域性质的调查研究工作相联系的那些学科，如地质学、生物学等，以及像数学那样可以不依靠近代实验设备而进行工作的理论学科，才能有些发展。而且这些发展，主要还是依靠科学家们自己的努力。一些新发展的科学技术部门和需要设备经费稍多的研究试验工作，则完全没有条件进行。不少正直的科学家虽然有发展中国科学技术的良好愿望，但是在国民党反动统治底下，到处碰壁，备受摧残，无法开展工作。依附帝国主义的旧中国的反动统治者，根本不想发展生产，也就不需要发展本国的科学技术。因此，总的说来，当时科学研究是和生产脱节的，理论脱离实际，当然更说不上科学为人民谋福利的目的性了。在旧中国，科学技术工作根本得不到生根发展的条件。科学家们自觉或不自觉地受资产阶级唯心观点所支配，所谓为科学而科学的思想普遍存在。
    在这样贫乏落后的基础上，经过十年艰苦努力，特别是1958年的大跃进，中国科学技术事业和队伍的发展是惊人的。到1958年底，全国共有专门的自然科学、技术研究机构八百四十多个，比解放时增长了二十倍；在这些机构中工作的科学技术人员则比解放时增长了五十倍。其中中国科学院直属科学技术研究机构九十一个；中央各个专业部门都有自己各行各业的研究试验机构；全国各省市、自治区，除西藏以外，都建立了本地区的科学分院和结合本地需要的一些研究机构。全国高等学校中的教师，多数人也进行了科学研究工作。全国许多大小工矿企业、人民公社，开展了群众性的科学技术活动，建立了无数的研究试验组织。中国科学技术协会的组织及会员，遍布全国城乡。在全国亿万人民中，由于社会主义建设的需要，热爱科学、钻研技术、向科学进军的高潮已经开始形成。科学技术人员的政治觉悟有很大提高，学术水平有很大进步。
    目前我国科学技术的状况是：第一，在学习掌握国外先进科学技术成就的同时，我们已经开始进行大量的创造性的研究工作。我们要结合我国的具体条件，加强研究工作，使现代的科学技术在我国生根发展，开花结果。第二，通过生产建设和科学技术的调查研究工作，积累了大量的关于自然资源和自然条件的资料，以及从工农业生产建设和医药卫生等各方面实践中取得的资料等，为进一步开展科学技术研究工作，打下了基础。第三，发掘了散处在民间和典籍中的大量科学技术遗产，例如农业、医药、气象、冶炼、轻工业工艺等的传统技术，并且开始了整理、研究工作。这些传统理论和技术经过分析研究，提高到现代科学的水平上来之后，将为各该学科的发展提供新的线索，可能作出重要的贡献。第四，填补了许多空白学科。在过去的许多缺门中，现在我们已经能够进行研究试验工作了。例如喷气技术、计算技术、射电天文学、石油化学、生物物理学等，在旧中国都是完全没有基础的，经过几年来的努力，并在苏联和其他社会主义国家的大力帮助下，已经初步建立相应的基地和培养了一些干部，并开展了研究工作。
    有了必要的科学技术队伍，打下了比较巩固的工作基础，我国的科学技术事业必将在今后更加迅速地飞跃前进。
            我国科学技术发展的三个阶段
    我国科学技术的发展，是随着我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的步伐前进的。十年来，科学技术事业的发展过程，大体上可以分为以下三个阶段：
    从中华人民共和国的成立到1956年，是科学技术发展的第一个阶段。随着新中国的成立，我们开始进行科学技术机构的组织建设和思想建设。我们接收了原中央研究院、北平研究院及其所属机构，在1949年11月成立了中国科学院。产业部门也接收了有关的研究试验机构。科学技术的组织和队伍，经过整顿，得到很大的发展。我们调整并充实了中国科学院以及各业务部门的科学技术研究机构，并且通过工作，培养了干部。我们通过教学改革和院系调整，初步改造了我国的科学技术教育，大批培养科学技术的新生力量。我们贯彻执行了党的团结、教育和改造知识分子的政策，帮助科学技术人员进行自我改造。科学技术人员参加了土改、镇反、抗美援朝、三反、思想改造学习等社会改革运动，学习马克思列宁主义的基本知识，学习苏联的先进科学技术的经验和成就，批判资产阶级唯心观点，并且在学习的基础上展开批评与自我批评，思想水平和政治觉悟大为提高。通过参加国家建设和从事科学技术工作的实践，科学技术人员亲身体验到：社会主义制度为科学技术的发展提供了最宽广的天地，而且也最需要科学技术的发展。在思想建设和组织建设的同时，开展联系实际、为生产建设服务的工作。当时正是三年国民经济恢复和第一个五年计划的前期，第一个五年计划中的骨干的重大建设项目，绝大部分是由苏联设计并帮助建设的，苏联向我们提供了最先进的、全面的技术援助。我国的科学技术工作，在努力学习、掌握苏联先进科学技术的条件下，进行了资源调查、勘探、配合设计以及配合研究试验的工作。理论科学在原有基础上也有所发展。这一时期的科学技术工作，总的说来，是比较零散的，创造性的研究工作也比较少。
    从1956年党中央召开的知识分子问题会议到1958年，是科学技术发展的第二个阶段。1956年1月，在农业、手工业、资本主义工商业社会主义改造进入高潮的时候，党中央召开关于知识分子问题会议，发出向科学进军的号召。提出十二年内在最重要和最急需的部门赶上或接近世界先进科学技术水平的要求。这个伟大的号召，指出了我国科学技术发展的前景，对于科学技术工作起了极大的作用。同年5月，党中央和毛泽东同志提出了在科学、文艺事业上“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，学术活动有很大的开展，学术思想活跃起来了。根据党中央的指示，1956年在毛泽东同志“全面规划、加强领导”的思想指导下，国务院成立了科学规划委员会，组织全国六百多位科学技术专家，制订了我国十二年科学技术发展的规划，从此中国的科学技术事业有了一个长期、全面的规划，这是我国科学技术史上的一件大事。当时，第一个五年计划已接近完成，国家已经开始编制第二个五年计划，因此就有可能比较全面地集中了我国社会主义建设对科学技术的要求；我们又比较系统地分析、研究了世界科学技术的先进水平和发展趋势，对于我国科学技术的现有水平和力量，也作了适当的评价。这些工作都使我们有可能全面地而且比较科学地订出一个长期的科学技术远景规划。这个规划体现了党和国家发展科学技术的方针政策和社会主义建设的需要，指出了我国科学技术的发展方向，对当前和长远、理论和实际、重点和一般的任务，尽可能地作了全面的安排，并且提出了实现规划所需要的人才培训、基地建设等措施。三年来的实践证明，这个远景规划对年度的科学技术计划和全国各个科学技术机构、高等学校的研究工作，都起了指导作用，对国民经济各部门技术水平的提高也起了促进的作用。并且使空白薄弱的科学技术部门的建立和加强、高等学校专业的设置、人才的培养、研究基地的建设等工作，都有了依据。1957年党派了大批优秀干部到科学技术战线，加强了对科学技术工作的领导。此后，我们制订全国性的年度科学技术计划，在全国范围内，统筹安排，把中国科学院、产业部门和高等学校的力量组织起来，加强协调，互相合作，我国的科学技术工作开始在全国规模上有计划地迅速前进。
    科学技术工作者和全国人民一样，在1957年经历了一个不平凡的夏天，那就是整风运动和反右斗争。这一场在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，对科学技术的发展，有着极其深远的意义。在科学技术界内部进行了一场科学技术发展方针道路的大辩论，这场辩论实质上是解决科学技术事业走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的问题。当时资产阶级右派分子向党发动了猖狂进攻，企图篡夺党对科学技术的领导，让科学技术离开社会主义轨道。他们提出了一整套反党、反社会主义的科学工作纲领。他们攻击党对科学技术的领导，叫嚷“外行不能领导内行”。他们提倡“为科学而科学”，否定科学为社会主义建设服务的神圣任务。他们反对科学技术的计划化，主张完全按照个人兴趣，分散地、盲目地进行工作。右派分子企图利用知识分子的某些弱点，把他们引入歧途，从而破坏我们社会主义的科学技术事业。但是，他们的阴谋彻底失败了，广大的科学技术工作者在党的领导下，坚决粉碎了右派分子的进攻，分清了敌我，提高了认识。在两条道路的斗争中，社会主义的道路获得了绝大多数科学技术人员的衷心拥护。这样，在科学技术工作中，就更加巩固地确立了党的领导。这是发展我国科学技术的根本问题，这个问题的解决，为我国科学技术事业的迅速发展提供了最根本的保证。
    从1958年开始，是科学技术发展的第三阶段。整风运动和反右派斗争，提高了广大干部和群众的社会主义觉悟，激发了广大干部和群众的积极性和创造性，带来了生产建设、文化教育、科学技术以及其它一切事业的全面大跃进。党的“八大”第二次会议制定了“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，提出了技术革命和文化革命的伟大任务。确定了在优先发展重工业的基础上，工农业同时并举、重工业与轻工业同时并举、中央工业与地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、土法生产和洋法生产同时并举等一整套两条腿走路的方针。这样，在我国六亿人民中掀起了一个全面大跃进的高潮。在工农业生产高潮的推动下，群众性的技术革命运动以排山倒海之势，奔腾前进。
    过去在科学技术工作中，不少人有迷信外国、盲目崇拜权威的思想，束缚住人们的头脑，不敢大胆研究、大胆创造。许多人对科学技术认为高不可攀，不敢问津。不少人强调科学技术的专门性，不相信群众，不认识实践对科学技术的重要意义。毛泽东同志提出了解放思想、破除迷信的号召，提出了发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，打掉了人们的自卑心理，启发了人们的智慧。科学技术工作开始大搞群众运动，贯彻群众路线，许多过去多少年来不敢动手的工作开始了，而且做出了成绩。过去许多老专家认为难以实现的新技术，却被年青人掌握了。过去许多科学家、工程师们所做不到的事情，工人农民也做到了，工矿农林各业都出现了大量的发明创造。经过整风、反右派斗争的锻炼，许多专家、学者的积极性大为提高，有的原定要三、五年才能完成的工作，一年就完成了，做出很多成绩。知识分子和劳动人民密切结合的风气，有了很大的发展。专家学者本来就应该是群众中的一员，只要他们以普通劳动者自处，到劳动人民中去，重视和学习群众实践的经验，他就可以从群的智慧中汲取很多宝贵的东西，并且把这些经验加以分析研究，就可以丰富科学技术的内容。科学家要真正确立群众观点，全心全意为群众服务，这样做，不但为思想改造所必需，而且也是提高科学水平所必需的。只要科学家能够自觉地和群众结合，那么，在科学技术工作中群众路线贯彻得越深入，就越能发挥科学家的作用。
    我们党在长期革命斗争中行之有效的群众路线的工作方法，在社会主义建设的各个战线上已显示了它的威力。一年多以来，群众性的农业大跃进和人民公社化运动、群众性的大办钢铁的运动、群众性的兴修水利的运动、群众性的技术革新运动，以及在各种事业上的群众运动，都推动着科学技术迅速发展。在科学技术工作中，贯彻了群众路线，提出了中央和地方并举、土洋并举、专业的科学技术研究机构和技术革命的群众活动相结合，普及和提高相结合，生产、教学和科学研究三者相结合的方针。一扫过去那种冷冷清清的局面，开始形成全党全民向科学技术进军的令人兴奋的形势。科学技术的花朵万紫千红，开遍祖国的大地。科学技术工作在实现技术革命和文化革命的伟大任务中大大迈进了一步。
    这十年来的实践证明了，只有在党的领导下，才能实现科学技术高速度的发展，证明了党不但胜利地领导我们进行阶级斗争，也胜利地领导我们进行和自然的斗争，发展生产力，发展科学技术。党提出了建设社会主义的总路线和技术革命、文化革命的伟大任务。党提出了十二年内我国科学技术赶上世界先进水平的号召，指出了科学技术工作的方针、道路和发展方向，领导我们制订了宏伟的科学技术远景发展规划。党提出团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策，帮助科学技术人员学习马克思列宁主义，在科学技术研究工作中运用辩证唯物主义的思想方法；并培养了大批新型知识分子。党提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。党发出破除迷信，解放思想的号召，教导我们在科学技术工作中贯彻群众路线的工作方法。
    在党的领导下，以辩证唯物主义作为思想指导，从社会主义建设任务出发，全面规划，加强协作，贯彻群众路线和两条腿走路的方针，开展科学技术工作，建设一支又红又专的科学技术队伍。这就是十年来科学技术工作取得辉煌成就的最重要最基本的经验。
        科学技术大跃进是总路线的伟大胜利
    从1958年以来的科学技术大跃进，是在科学技术工作中贯彻了党的建设社会主义总路线的结果，是总路线的伟大胜利。从此，我们摸索到一条加速发展我国科学技术的道路，我们必须坚持这条道路，争取更快地摆脱我国科学技术的落后状态，迅速赶上世界先进水平。
    大跃进以来的成绩，是客观存在的事实，谁也抹煞不了。可是，对这一场群众运动的伟大成就，由于人们的立场观点不同，还有不同的看法。我们在1958年改变了少数人冷冷清清搞研究的局面，创造了许多新的方法和经验，科学技术特大丰收，这是绝大多数人的看法。可是，在科学技术界也有一些有浓厚资产阶级思想的人，却在旁边评头论足，说这也不成，那也不成。他们看不惯轰轰烈烈的群众运动，认为这样就把科学工作的常规打乱了，他们认为青年人、工农革新家做不了什么科学技术研究工作；他们说：“还是走过去的老路好。”他们夸大胜利发展所带来的某些缺点，说我们的科学技术工作“数量上虽然有发展，质量上没有提高”，说：“为生产服务的工作是进展了，但是理论上却没有收获”。坚持这些错误观点的人，虽然不多；但是，还有一些人在这个或那个问题上，有一些糊涂观念。因此，对于这些错误观点，有加以驳斥的必要。
    在科学技术工作中，破除迷信、解放思想和贯彻群众路线是不可分割的。科学技术是人类在生产斗争中物质生产和科学试验的劳动结晶。如果我们坚信科学是劳动创造的，那么我们就必然会重视群众生产斗争的实践和实践中的经验。在社会主义制度下，发展生产力，进行生产斗争，必须大搞群众运动。这一条真理，在工农业大跃进中证实了。在科学技术工作中要不要大搞群众运动，在大跃进前是有不少人怀疑的。经过1958年以来的实践，证明科学技术工作和生产斗争一样，不但可以搞群众运动，而且必须搞群众运动。工农群众密切接触实际，在生产当中遇到很多实际问题，他们又有丰富的生产经验，他们在解决这些问题的时候，往往出现可贵的科学技术发展的萌芽。因此，科学技术工作必须到群众中去，到生产中去。同时，就是在科学技术研究机构中，也必须大搞群众运动，充分动员一切力量来进行工作，许多研究所去年大搞群众运动，一年的研究成果就超过过去几年，就是很好的例证。
    去年以来，我们建立了许多研究机构，扩大了研究人员的队伍，动员广大工农群众参加了调查、研究、试验等科学技术工作。研究课题成倍地增加。虽然有了这么大的发展，可是，对于我们这样一个一穷二白而建设速度要求很高的大国来说，科学技术力量还是不能适应需要。
    我国是一个经济、技术落后的国家，同时又是一个经济、技术情况十分复杂的国家。我们既有现代化的机器生产，同时也存在着大量笨重体力劳动；我们既有农业拖拉机，同时又存在着大量的手工作业；我们有汽车、飞机等近代交通工具，同时也依靠大量肩挑背负来运输。我们要在不太长的时间内走完资本主义国家经历一二百年的工业革命的道路，要把全国经济逐步从落后的技术转移到先进的技术基础上来。因此，就需要进行大量的各种各样的科学技术工作。其中有些工作，如果以近代科学技术水平来衡量，可能不是什么新课题，但只要它对于生产建设有利，对于提高劳动生产率有利，我们就应该重视它，进行研究，大力推广。
    目前我们又处在科学技术突飞猛进的时代，许多新兴的科学技术，如原子能、喷气技术、计算技术、无线电电子学等，我们都要尽快地掌握，以便迅速赶上世界先进水平，服务于经济建设和国防建设。
    我国又是一个大国，自然、社会、经济、文化等各种条件在各地都有很大的差异，许多科学技术工作必须结合地区特点。旧中国留给我们的近代科学技术基础又非常薄弱，对某些学科来说，甚至完全是空白，亟需填补和发展。因此，在各个地区、各部门都必须有相应的科学技术力量，才能密切结合各部门、各地方的实际情况，进行科学技术研究工作。
    因此，我们必须进行大量的多方面的研究工作，才能适应内容复杂的生产建设的需要。如果我们没有足够的机构和人力，没有群众路线的工作方法，是不足以承担这样复杂繁多的任务的。
    从科学技术工作本身来看，没有一定数量的工作，也难以提高质量。没有大量的气象站的资料，无法提高气象科学的理论水平，没有很大规模的地质调查，就难以探索成矿的规律。何况这些工作对于解决当前实际问题，培养青年干部独立工作的能力都是必不可少的。至于有些工作，目前则处于前进中的一个阶段，或者才刚刚开始，更细致更深入的工作有待下一步来做，例如对去年已取得一定成果的课题，今年大都在继续做深入的研究，系统地整理数据和总结经验。良好的开端，是成功的一半，有什么理由对于这一半的成功横加非议呢？
    同时，去年大跃进以来，不但数量大大发展，质量也有很大的提高。一方面去年从无到有，开拓了许多新工作，对我们整个科学技术工作本身就是一个提高。另一方面，过去已经开展的工作，在原有的基础上，去年以来也有很大的提高。更不用说我们科学技术队伍质量的提高了。
    说我们为生产服务的工作开展了，这是对的。说理论上没有收获，这就错了。去年一年也是我国理论研究工作发展最快的一年，学术论文大丰收。例如中国科学院和全国科协所属的各自然科学专门学会所主办的学术刊物，其中发表的论文字数，1958年比1957年增加47％；比1952年增加二十一倍，这是最有说服力的统计数字。当然这些工作有些是去年做的，也有些是去年以前做的，但是没有大跃进，也总结不出这么多的理论成果。去年一年，各高等学校编辑出版的教材也有大量的增加，仅高等教育出版社已经刊行的就有二百余种，约为1957年的四倍，而且内容上还增加了许多从中国实际出发总结出来的理论。这能不说是理论工作的跃进吗？实践对理论研究的推动作用，这还不明显吗？既然去年不少理论工作是在前年、大前年或三年、五年以前的研究实验工作的总结，为什么不允许去年做的研究实验工作等到今年、明年、后年做出理论的总结呢？科学研究工作要在理论上有所建树，一般地说，不是短时间所能做到的。去年跃进中的研究成果，还来不及全部做出理论的总结，是完全可以理解的。
    十年来，特别是大跃进以来，我国科学技术人员和广大劳动人民在一起，做了大量的基础工作，搜集和积累了大量的调查、观测、研究实验的资料数据。在这些工作的基础上，我们是可以、而且必然会在理论上做出重大贡献的。
    从生产建设的实践中，提出来许多理论问题，要求科学技术研究人员给予解决。例如，合理的深耕密植对农业增产有极其显著的效果，我们需要在大量实践成果的基础上，进一步总结它的规律。炼铁高炉的利用系数很高，我们需要在炼铁技术的理论上有所发展。中医针灸的疗效是完全肯定的，我们需要进一步探讨它的理论。我们要足够重视理论工作，正确地贯彻理论与实际相联系的方针，坚决反对理论与实际相脱离。
    总之，从1958年以来的科学技术大跃进，道路是完全正确的，成就是伟大的。破除迷信、解放思想，大搞群众运动，正是科学技术工作的革命常规。大跃进以来，不但数量大发展，而且质量大提高；不但为生产服务取得了很大成绩，理论研究工作也有很大收获。任何对大跃进成就的怀疑，都是毫无根据的。
    不久以前，党的八届八中全会号召全党和全国人民反右倾、鼓干劲，为在今年内提前完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗。这个战斗的号令，掀起了全国人民轰轰烈烈的增产节约群众运动。国内外敌对分子的污蔑和中伤都是枉费心机，右倾机会主义的动摇和怀疑都被群众运动的汹涌浪潮淹没了。我们要很好地学习领会党的八届八中全会决议的精神，正确认识大跃进的伟大意义，在已经取得巨大胜利的基础上，掀起一个新的高潮，乘胜前进。
                            ＊　＊　＊　＊ 
    人民的新中国渡过了光辉的十年。十年来我国科学技术的成就是巨大的，科学技术事业打下了良好的基础。飞跃前进的社会主义建设要求我国科学技术在下一个十年内有更大、更快的发展。
    在下一个十年内，我们将要彻底改变中国科学技术的落后面貌，将要提前完成十二年科学技术发展远景规划，尽快地赶上世界先进水平。大批的青年科学技术工作者将不断地成长、成熟，并将有更多的工农群众革新家参加科学技术研究和发展工作，我们的科学家将在今后作出更多的贡献，我们将拥有一支更为强大的又红又专的科学技术队伍。科学技术工作将在建设一个强大的社会主义国家的过程中，发挥更大的作用。
