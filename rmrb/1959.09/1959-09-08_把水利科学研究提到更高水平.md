Elevate Water Conservancy Science Research to a Higher Level
Qin Xiudian, Vice President of the Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power Research Institute

    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, water conservancy took the lead. Many provinces and regions basically met the requirements of water conservancy, and the country's irrigation area doubled. This created conditions for the bumper agricultural harvest in 1958 and this year's flood and drought prevention.
    Our people have thousands of years of experience in water conservancy, but the active development of water conservancy scientific research is only a recent phenomenon. Especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, due to production needs, a vigorous development with blossoming everywhere appeared. For example, every commune in Henan Province set up hydrological observation stations, and each prefecture and some counties in Guangdong Province established water conservancy and soil testing laboratories. The people's urgent demand for water conservancy and their daring to think and act promoted the water conservancy cause. New technologies such as tidal power stations, underwater clay embankment construction, explosive excavation of river networks, stone arch dam construction, wooden arch flumes, and large slope excavation appeared everywhere, thus truly achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results under difficult conditions. On some large-scale projects, high-speed construction records became even more common. In terms of concrete pouring speed and one-time height, cutoff flow, rolling dam construction speed, and underwater clay embankment construction height, despite our inadequate material conditions, we approached or surpassed the level of other advanced countries.
    In addition, in order to overcome the difficulties in the Great Leap Forward, many indigenous and foreign methods were adopted and achieved success, such as grass and soil cofferdams, earth kiln cement dam construction, and willow planting for bank protection and dam construction.
    The magnificent Three Gorges Project and the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, which affects half of China, are long-term work goals of water conservancy scientific research. Water conservancy workers across the country, including those from government agencies and universities, have been organized into relevant research projects, giving full play to unprecedented enthusiasm and creativity, and have achieved abundant results.
    The Party's call has inspired water conservancy scientific research workers. Everyone is more determined to exert their utmost effort, actively overcome right-leaning sentiments, and is determined to work hard in September to welcome National Day, and strive to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year.

    把水利科学研究提到更高水平
    水利水电科学研究院副院长　覃修典
    在1958年的大跃进中，水利一马当先，许多省份和地区，基本上达到水利化的要求，全国的灌溉面积翻了番。这就为1958年农业大丰收和今年的防洪抗旱创造了条件。
    我国人民办水利有了几千年的经验，但是水利科学研究工作的积极开展，还是近几年的事。特别是1958年大跃进中，由于生产需要，出现了蓬勃发展、遍地开花的局面。如河南省每个公社都设立了水文观测站，广东省各专区和某些县都成立了水利和土工试验室，群众对水利的迫切的要求和敢想敢干的作风推动了水利事业。到处出现了像潮汐电站、像粘土水中倒土筑坝，爆炸开挖河网、砌石筑拱坝、木拱度槽、大劈坡开挖等一些新技术的创造，因而在困难的条件下真正作到了多快好省。在一些大型工程上，更普遍出现了高速度建设的记录，在混凝土浇筑速度和一次高度，截流流量，碾压坝上坝速度，水中倒土筑坝高度等方面，尽管我们的物质条件是很不够的，仍接近或超过其他先进国家的水平。
    另外，为了克服大跃进中的困难，也采取了很多土洋结合的方法，并获得了成功，如草土围堰，土窑水泥筑坝，插柳护岸筑坝等。
    宏伟的三峡工程和影响半个中国的南水北调工程，是水利科学研究的较长时期的工作目标。全国的水利工作者，包括机关和高等学校，都组织到有关的研究项目中，发挥了空前的积极性和创造性，获得了丰富的成果。
    党的号召鼓舞了水利科学研究工作者，每个人都更加鼓足干劲，积极克服右倾情绪，决心大干9月份，迎接国庆，为在今年内提前完成第二个五年计划而努力奋斗。
