Five Hundred Years Since the Founding of Bucharest

September 20th marks the 500th anniversary of the appearance of Bucharest, the capital of the Romanian People's Republic, in historical documents. In its five-hundred-year history, Bucharest has been filled with many heroic and moving deeds.

In Bucharest, the voivode of Wallachia, Mircea the Elder, stopped the Turkish invasion at the end of the 14th century; here, the hero Michael the Brave defeated the rampaging Turkish cavalry in the 16th century. Bucharest was the center of the popular uprising against domestic and foreign feudal lords in 1821. During the revolution of 1848, the people of Bucharest fought bloody battles to resist the foreign troops summoned by the aristocracy. Before the Great October Revolution, in the era of imperialism in Romania, Bucharest was the center of the Romanian workers' movement. During the twenty years between the two world wars, when the Romanian reactionary clique moved towards fascism, Bucharest stood at the forefront of the struggle. In the anti-Hitler war, the people of Bucharest, under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, launched an armed uprising in August 1944 to welcome the Soviet army's liberation of Romania.

After the establishment of the Romanian People's Republic on December 30, 1947, Bucharest became the beautiful capital of the Romanian People's Republic. The heroic people of Bucharest have devoted their energy to a new battle – building a new Bucharest.

In the past ten years or so, famous buildings have continuously emerged in Bucharest, such as the "Cassa Scînteia Cultural Palace," the Broadcasting House, and the Opera and Ballet Theater... And construction projects are still developing rapidly.

Now, Bucharest has become a huge construction site, and the heroic songs of the builders are filled everywhere from the suburbs to the city center. Countless young people, under the organization of the Union of Working Youth, are carrying out joyful voluntary labor. Not long ago, 90,000 Bucharest youths presented the motherland with the results of voluntary labor worth 13.5 million lei to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Romania's liberation from fascist enslavement.

Bucharest is building a large number of school buildings and conducting surveys for greening. In addition, work has been carried out to improve the city's water supply, build waterways and reservoirs. The distribution network of gas pipes has also been expanded. …All these great projects are assisted by voluntary labor personnel.

The beautiful, fighting Bucharest is the glory and pride of the Romanian people! (With picture)

    布加勒斯特建城五百年
    9月20日是罗马尼亚人民共和国首都布加勒斯特出现于历史文献的第五百周年纪念日。在五百年的历史过程里，布加勒斯特充满了可歌可泣的英勇事迹。
    在布加勒斯特，罗马尼亚公国的诸侯老米尔恰于十四世纪末阻止了土耳其人的进犯，在这里，勇士米哈伊于十六世纪打败了横行一时的土耳其骑兵。布加勒斯特是1821年反对本国封建主和外国封建主的人民起义的中心。1848年的革命时期，布加勒斯特的人民进行了浴血苦斗、抵抗贵族召来的外国军队。在伟大的十月革命以前，帝国主义时代的罗马尼亚，布加勒斯特是罗马尼亚工人运动的中心，在两次世界大战的二十年间，当罗马尼亚反动集团走向法西斯道路的时候，布加勒斯特站在斗争的最前列。在反希特勒的战争中，布加勒斯特人民在罗马尼亚共产党领导下于1944年8月举行了武装起义、迎接苏军解放罗马尼亚。
    1947年12月30日罗马尼亚人民共和国成立以后，布加勒斯特变成了罗马尼亚人民共和国美丽的首都。英勇的布加勒斯特的人民把他们的精力投入了新的战斗——建设新的布加勒斯特。
    最近十多年以来，布加勒斯特不断地出现了著名的建筑物，例如：“卡沙·斯肯台依文化宫”、广播之家、歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院……而建筑的工程仍旧在飞跃地发展着。
    现在，布加勒斯特已经成了一个巨大的工地，从郊区到市中心，到处洋溢着建设者豪迈的歌声。无数的青年在劳动青年联盟的组织下，进行着愉快的义务劳动。不久以前，九万名布加勒斯特青年向祖国呈献了价值达一千三百五十万列依的义务劳动成果，以庆祝罗马尼亚摆脱法西斯奴役的十五周年。
    布加勒斯特正在兴建大量的学校建筑，并为绿化进行了勘察工作。除此以外，还进行了改进城市供水的工作、建造水道和贮水站。煤气管的分布网也扩大了。……所有这些伟大的工程都有义务劳动人员的协助。
    美丽的、战斗的布加勒斯特是罗马尼亚人民的光荣与骄傲！（附图片）
