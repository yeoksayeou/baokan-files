Baogang Red Flag
By our reporters Zhao Yongxi and Wang Wenliang

The 80,000 workers building Baogang, encouraged by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, overcame numerous difficulties with their diligence and wisdom, and completed the first world-class large blast furnace one year ahead of schedule on the desolate Gobi Desert. Truly, heroes emerge in great numbers, and the atmosphere is magnificent.

        The Miraculous Old Scaffold Worker Chen Qirong

In May of this year, the blast furnace equipment installation project was very intense. After the inclined bridge was installed, the main winch had to be installed immediately. The command of the blast furnace work area had an order: The installation of the blast furnace main winch base and drum was limited to ten days. These equipments had to be installed under the inclined bridge, and the inclined bridge was blocking above, which was very difficult. The original plan was to use a 12-zhang large gantry crane for lifting, but the gantry crane itself weighed only 15 tons, while the drum was 20 tons and the base was 18 tons. The gantry crane's load capacity was insufficient. There were all kinds of problems. What to do? That night, after the workers got off work, the old scaffold worker and Communist Party member Chen Qirong was still walking around the large blast furnace. Late at night, he simply stayed in the shed and did not go home. He pondered all night, and early the next morning, he found the technician Zhu Xiaoxian and proposed a method of using a 20-zhang gantry crane without reinforcement, and coordinating it with a 4-4 pulley block, a 15-ton chain hoist, and a 15-ton pulley block for lifting. After the comrades discussed it, they felt that this method would work, so they immediately started working. As a result, the ten-day project was completed in six days.

Speaking of the old scaffold worker Chen Qirong, who has 30 years of experience, everyone praises him for his rich experience.

He showed his skills when hoisting the two large cover balance bars of the blast furnace top. Each large cover balance bar was three meters long and weighed three or four thousand kilograms. It had to be hoisted to the 70-meter-high blast furnace top. The gantry crane could not lift it, and the tower crane was not long enough to reach. He repeatedly pondered and finally came up with a step-by-step lifting method: add a vertical column under the gas discharge pipe platform on the furnace top, install a chain hoist on the platform, use a 40-ton tower crane to lift the balance bar from the crotch of the gas downcomer, place it on the platform, and then use the chain hoist to transport it up. At that time, the people present, seeing Lao Chen so magically directing these hoisting tools to work up and down the large blast furnace, all praised him.

              "Living Luban" Li Wanxi

On the construction site of No. 1 blast furnace, Communist Party member Li Wanxi is known as "Living Luban." He is the captain of a mixed work team, and knows twelve techniques such as plastering, bricklaying, stonemasonry, caulking, tile hanging, steel bars, scaffolding, concrete... He leads a group of young men, and when they work, they always pick the difficult jobs to do, and always complete the tasks ahead of schedule. This happened in April of this year: the leadership assigned them the task of pouring concrete for the foundation of the No. 2 blower equipment, with a construction period of ten days, only allowed to be ahead of schedule, not allowed to be delayed. This bold plan was already shocking enough, because at the end of last year, the second team spent thirty-five days to complete the pouring of the equipment foundation of the No. 1 blower. However, after Li Wanxi learned from the Party branch that this project must be completed in a short period of time, otherwise it would affect the iron tapping, he did not hesitate to make a guarantee to the branch that it would be completed in five days. This immediately frightened those with right-leaning conservative ideas. They said: "Completing it in ten days would be setting a world record; completing it in five days, I will crawl to deliver the red flag to you." But the young men of Li Wanxi's team answered very simply: "Do it! Don't listen to their nonsense." "We will definitely create a miracle and let the blast furnace tap iron ahead of schedule!"

No sooner said than done, within two hours, a battle to encircle the equipment foundation began. The workers were assembling wooden formwork on one side and busy tying steel bars on the other. With few people and a large workload, they adopted a relay race. The ten-meter square concrete foundation was surrounded by workers day and night. Li Wanxi worked day and night for four days and four nights, sometimes seen tying steel bars with the workers, and sometimes seen picking up the vibrator and compacting the concrete. If there was a problem, he would call a meeting of the group leaders to study ways to catch up. As a result, the task was completed in only four and a half days.

              Gao Xiting Subdues the "Dragon"

After Baogang was put into production, it needed 500,000 cubic meters of water every day. In order to complete the Yellow River water supply project as soon as possible and create conditions for early iron tapping, Gao Xiting, an eighth-grade plumber and Communist Party member, and a group of plumbers came to the booster pump station construction site on the bank of the Yellow River. More than 300 people worked hard for a while and dug most of the pump station foundation earthwork to the elevation, and were about to start digging a small ditch under the foundation, but they were stumped. This ditch was not large, only one meter deep, three meters wide, and thirty meters long, but it was located on the quicksand layer on the bank of the Yellow River. The quicksand layer is like a dragon lurking underground. If you don't touch it, it's fine, but once you touch it, water and sand will come rushing in. At this time, the side slopes collapsed, the pipe trenches collapsed, and even concrete that was not strong enough could be broken through.

The fifty-five-year-old Gao Xiting, regardless of the severe cold of the frontier where wind and snow were mixed, served the six air compressors day and night. He sometimes turned on the faucet and sometimes uncovered the pump cover. If there was nothing wrong with the water pump, he would check the needle filter. On the freezing nights, he peeled off the insulation straw tied around the needle filter and put his ear to the water pipe, listening here and there. His ear was peeled off a layer of skin by the cold iron pipe, but he ignored it. He heard some pipes roaring very loudly, and some were worse, with uneven flow. Based on his many years of experience, he knew that the suction stroke of the air compressor was too high and too far. If the positions of the water pump and air compressor were lowered, and the groundwater passage area was rationally divided, the pumping volume could be increased. At this time, someone came from Baotou and told him that his daughter, who was studying in Beijing, had come home to visit him. The old man was shocked and realized that the Spring Festival was approaching. But he did not go home, and went straight to the Party branch secretary at the construction site. He and the workers fought hard for more than thirty hours, adjusted the equipment, and the pumping volume was indeed doubled. The "dragon" was subdued, and the water source project was rapidly advanced.

    包钢红旗
    本报记者　赵永西　王文亮
    建设包钢的八万名职工，在党的社会主义建设总路线鼓舞下，用他们的勤劳和智慧，克服重重困难，在黄沙蔽天的大荒滩上，提前一年建成了第一座世界第一流的大高炉。真个是英雄辈出，气象万千。
        神奇的老架工陈启荣
    今年5月间，高炉设备安装工程很紧张。斜桥安装完了，马上要安装主卷扬机，高炉工区指挥部有命令：高炉主卷扬机机座和卷筒安装，限期十天
  完成，这些设备都要安在斜桥下面，斜桥挡在上面，很不好办。原来计划是用十二丈大抱子起吊，可是抱子自重才十五吨，而卷筒是二十吨，机座是十八吨，抱子负荷不够。尽是难题，怎么办呢？当晚工人都下班了，老架工、共产党员陈启荣还在大高炉周围转转。夜深了，他索性住在工棚里，没回家。他捉摸了一夜，第二天一早他就找到技术员朱孝先，提出用二十丈抱子不加固，和四四滑子、十五吨链式起重机、十五吨滑子配合协同起吊的办法。同志们一商量，觉得这办法行，马上就干。结果十天工期，六天就完成了。
    提起已有三十年工龄的老架工陈启荣，人人都称赞他经验丰富。
    吊装高炉炉顶的两个大盖平衡杆时，他大显身手。每个大盖平衡杆都有三米长，重三、四千公斤，要吊到七十米高的高炉炉顶，抱子吊不上，塔式吊车又不够长，进不去。他反复捉摸，终于想出了一个步步登高的办法：在炉顶煤气放散管平台下面加一根立柱，在平台上安上一台链式起重机，用四十吨塔式吊车把平衡杆从煤气下降管裤裆叉的空子里吊上去，放在平台上，然后再用链式起重机接运上去。当时在场的人，看见老陈如此神奇地指挥这些吊装工具在大高炉上上下下工作着，莫不啧啧称赞。
              “活鲁班”李万喜
    在一号高炉工地上，共产党员李万喜被人们称为是“活鲁班”。他是一个混合工作队的队长，通晓抹灰、砌砖、砌石、抅缝、挂瓦、钢筋、架子、混凝土……等十二种技术。他领导着一帮小伙子，工作起来，尽拣难活干，而且每次总是提前完成任务。这是今年4月的事：领导上把二号鼓风机设备基础的浇灌混凝土任务交给了他们，工期十天，只许提前，不许拖后。这个大胆的计划已经够使人吃惊的了，因为去年年底，二队在浇灌一号鼓风机的设备基础时，用了三十五天才完成。但李万喜从党支部知道这项工程必须在短期内完成，否则就要影响出铁的情况以后，就毫不犹豫地向支部提出保证五天完成。这一下，可吓坏了那些有右倾保守思想的人。他们说：“十天完成，就算你创造世界纪录；五天完成，我爬着给你们去送红旗。”但李万喜队的小伙子们回答得很干脆：“干！别听他们瞎说。”“我们一定创造奇迹，让高炉提前出铁！”
    说时迟，那时快，没出两小时，一场围攻设备基础的战斗就开始了。工人们一面拚装木模板，一面忙着绑钢筋。人少工程量大，就采用车轮战，方圆十米见方的混凝土基础，被工人们日夜包围。李万喜没白没黑地干了四天四夜，一会儿见他和工人绑钢筋，一会儿又见他拿起震动棒，捣固混凝土。一有问题，他就召开小组长会，研究迎头赶上的办法。结果，任务只用了四天半就完成了。
              高喜亭降服“蛟龙”
    包钢投入生产后，每天需要五十万立方米水。为了早日建成黄河给水工程，给提前出铁创造条件，八级水暖工、共产党员高喜亭和一帮水暖工来到了黄河岸上的加压泵站工地。三百多个人猛干了一阵，把泵站基础土方大部分挖到了标高，正要开始挖基础下面的一条小沟时，却被难住了。这条沟并不大，总共只有一米深、三米宽、三十米长，但它位于黄河岸上的流沙层上。流沙层，好像埋伏在地下的一条蛟龙，你不碰它也就罢了，一碰到它，连水带沙，汹涌而来。这时候，只见边坡陷落，管沟下塌，连强度不够的混凝土它也可以冲破。
    五十五岁的高喜亭，不避风雪交加的塞外严寒，日夜服侍着六台压缩机，他时而打开水龙头，时而揭开水泵盖。水泵上没有毛病，他就去检查针状过滤器。在严寒逼人的夜晚，他扒开绑在针状过滤器周围的保温稻草，把耳朵贴在水管上，这边听听，那边听听。耳朵被冰冷的铁管沾去了一层皮，他也没理会。他听见有的管子里咕噜咕噜响得很厉害，有的就差些，流量很不均匀。凭他多年的经验，知道这是空气压缩机的吸程太高太远，如果把水泵和空气压缩机的位置降低一下，再合理划分一下地下水的通过区，抽水量就可以提高。这时候，有人从包头来，告诉他在北京念书的女儿来家探望他。老人心里震动了一下，才知道快过春节了。但他没有回家，径直奔往工地党总支书记那里。他和工人们苦战了三十多个小时，调整好设备，抽水量果然提高了一倍。“蛟龙”被降服了，水源地工程迅速向前推进。
