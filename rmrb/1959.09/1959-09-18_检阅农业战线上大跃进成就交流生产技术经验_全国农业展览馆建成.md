Reviewing the Great Leap Forward Achievements on the Agricultural Front, Exchanging Production Technology and Experience
National Agricultural Exhibition Hall Completed

(Reported by this newspaper) The National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, built to showcase the great achievements on the agricultural front over the past decade, especially the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture last year, and to exchange and promote advanced experiences, has been completed in Beijing.

The National Agricultural Exhibition Hall consists of twelve sections: the Comprehensive Hall, Crop Hall, Special Produce and Horticulture Hall, Agricultural Science Hall, Water Conservancy Hall, Measures Hall, Meteorology Hall, Aquaculture Hall, Animal Husbandry Hall, Forestry Hall, Tool Hall, and People's Commune Industry Hall. It has a total construction area of over 28,000 square meters. To avoid overcrowding, the architects designed the layout with the twelve halls forming four building complexes, scattered across approximately 50 hectares of land. Each hall has its own separate entrance and exit. Visitors can choose which ones to visit based on their interests. This avoids overcrowding due to excessive concentration of visitors and facilitates management. In terms of architectural art, traditional Chinese techniques such as adapting to local conditions, borrowing scenery subtly, and creating a sense of anticipation were employed to achieve richness and variety.

This project began construction in early December last year. Under the illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, three thousand builders, from design to construction, took only a little over a year, and the quality met the design requirements.

The Beijing Joint State-Private Building Engineering Company, which undertook this project, mainly handled house repairs or general civil construction in the past. Constructing such a complex project was a first for them. At the time, the main difficulties they faced were poor technical capabilities, poor machinery and equipment, and a lack of experience in advanced construction. In response, the company's Party committee promptly put forward the slogan "Stubborn Hard Work Means Victory" to the workers, calling on them to study technology diligently and complete the construction tasks on schedule. The workers responded to the Party's call, launching a wave of technical learning, with a scene of competition and time-saving visible everywhere on the construction site.

The Beijing First Industrial Architecture Design Institute was responsible for designing this project. The design staff produced more than fifty plans, widely soliciting opinions from both inside and outside the institute, and then concentrated the advantages of each plan to create a design scheme that was both unique in style and had national characteristics. The architectural decoration design of the Agricultural Exhibition Hall was mostly handled by teachers and students from the Sculpture Department and the Arts and Crafts Department of the Luxun Academy of Fine Arts. After going deep into the countryside to experience life, they adopted traditional forms in the decoration design based on the overall design intent, making the artistic images more perfect. The sculptures, plaster decorations, and more than forty types of novel lamps here are combined with the characteristics of each hall, greatly increasing the building's appeal to visitors.

The roads and gardens for this project were constructed by the Beijing First and Fourth Municipal Engineering Companies. During the construction process, they received support from twelve provinces and cities across the country. (Attached Pictures)

    检阅农业战线上大跃进成就交流生产技术经验
    全国农业展览馆建成
    本报讯　为了展览十年来农业战线上的伟大成就，特别是去年农业大跃进的成就，并交流推广先进经验而兴建的全国农业展览馆，已在北京建成。
    全国农业展览馆由综合馆、农作物馆、特产园艺馆、农业科学馆、水利馆、措施馆、气象馆、水产馆、畜牧馆、林业馆、工具馆和人民公社工业馆十二个部分组成，建筑面积达二万八千多平方米。为了避免观众拥挤，建筑师们在设计平面布局时，将十二个馆组成四个建筑群，分散地布置在五十公顷左右的土地上。每个馆都有单独的出入口。观众可以根据自己的兴趣去选择参观。这样，既避免了观众过分集中而发生的拥挤现象，又便于管理。在建筑艺术上，采用了我国传统的因地制宜、借景含蓄、引人入放胜等手法，做到丰富多彩。
    这项工程，是在去年12月初动工兴建的。在党的社会主义建设总路线照耀下，三千名建设者从设计到施工，只用了一年多时间，质量达到设计要求。
    担负这项工程的北京市公私合营建筑工程公司，过去主要是担任房屋修缮或一般性的民用建筑；兴建这样复杂的工程，还是第一次。当时，他们面临着的主要困难是技术力量差、机具设备差和高级建筑施工经验少。根据这个情况，这个公司的党委会及时向工人提出：“顽强刻苦就是胜利”的口号，号召工人努力学习技术，按期完成建筑任务。职工们响应了党的号召，掀起了学习技术的热潮，工地上到处都出现你追我赶，分秒必争的场面。
    北京第一工业建筑设计院负责设计这项工程。设计人员一共做出了五十多个方案，广泛征求院内外的意见，然后集中了各个方案的优点，做出了既有独特风格，又有民族特点的设计方案。农业展览馆的建筑装饰设计，大部分是鲁迅美术学院雕塑系和工艺美术系的师生负责的。他们深入农村体验生活后，根据总的设计意图，采用了装饰设计中的传统形式，使艺术形象更臻完美。这里的雕塑、石膏花饰和四十多种式样新颖的灯，都结合各个馆的特点，大大增加了建筑物对观众的感染力量。
    这项工程的道路和庭园，是北京市第一、第四市政工程公司施工的。在建设过程中，得到全国十二个省、市的支援。（附图片）
