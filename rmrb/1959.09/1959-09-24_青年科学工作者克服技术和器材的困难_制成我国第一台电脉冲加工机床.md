Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd. Under the leadership of the Party, young researchers from the Institute of Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Machine Tool Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ninth Research Institute, displayed a communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. They overcame various technical and equipment difficulties and, in less than a year, successfully designed and trial-produced China's first D5540 electric pulse forming perforation machine tool. After testing and evaluation, this machine tool has initially met the required standards and is undergoing small-scale production to meet the urgent needs of the national machinery industry to actively adopt die forging. The birth of this machine tool marks a major step forward in China's electrical machining field, laying a good foundation for rapidly catching up with the world's advanced levels in the future.

The D5540 electric pulse forming perforation machine tool is mainly used for processing forging dies and repairing worn-out old dies. It uses a rectifier-type pulse generator as the pulse power source, with an average power of 4.3 kilowatts, a rated current of 80 amperes, and an overload current of up to 100 amperes. It employs a push-pull magnetic amplifier as the automatic control system. The machine tool's metal removal rate (i.e., productivity) reaches 1,200 cubic millimeters per minute, which is twice as high as that of electric spark machining tools.

Using this machine tool to process molds can not only shorten processing time and reduce manual labor for fitters but also lower processing costs. For example, using this machine tool to process the shift fork forging die of a tractor factory takes less than four hours, while milling takes sixteen hours. The fitter's polishing time after electric pulse machining is about twelve hours, while the fitter's polishing time after milling is twenty-four hours. In addition, this machine tool can effectively repair worn-out molds, thereby saving valuable mold steel.

In the ten years since liberation, China's machinery industry has been developing rapidly, requiring an increasing variety of molds in production. The processing of molds, especially the processing of forming cavities such as forging dies, generally relies on the extensive manual labor of senior fitters after preliminary contour processing using copy milling or vertical milling. They use chisels to shave, grinding wheels to polish, and fine abrasives to grind. This is not only labor-intensive and time-consuming, but also difficult to process deep and narrow areas. After new molds are worn, they are often no longer used due to the difficulty of repair, thus wasting much valuable mold steel. Many factories often experience production growth being affected by the lack of mold supply. Although some large factories have large-scale mold workshops with a large number of machine tools and senior fitters, it is still difficult to meet the demand for molds. Therefore, the mechanization of mold processing and the reduction of fitters' physical labor as much as possible are urgent problems to be solved.

Future efforts will focus on improving existing machine tools to enhance the surface finish of machining; researching high-power electric pulse machining tools to meet the production needs of large molds; and continuing to research high-frequency, high-power pulse machining tools.

    青年科学工作者克服技术和器材的困难
    制成我国第一台电脉冲加工机床
    新华社23日讯　中国科学院电工研究所、第一机械工业部机床研究所和第九研究所的青年研究人员们在党的领导下，发挥了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，克服了技术上和器材上的种种困难，在不到一年的时间里，设计和试制成功了国产第一台D5540型电脉冲成形穿孔机床。这台机床经过试验和鉴定已初步达到要求标准，正在进行小批生产，以满足全国机械工业积极采用模锻的迫切需要。这台机床的诞生，标志我国在电加工方面向前迈进了一大步，为今后迅速赶上世界先进水平奠定了良好的基础。
    D5540型电脉冲成形穿孔机床主要用来加工锻压模和修复已磨损的旧模具。它采用整流式脉冲发电机作为脉冲的电源，其平均功率为四点三瓩，额定电流为八十安培，过载电流达一百安培；采用推挽式磁放大器作为自动控制系统。这台机床的金属蚀除速度（即生产率）达每分钟一千二百立毫米，比电火花加工机床的金属蚀除速度还高一倍。
    利用这种机床加工模具时，不但可以缩短加工时间，减轻钳工的手工劳动，而且可以降低加工成本。例如，用这种机床加工拖拉机厂的拨叉锻模时间不到四小时，而用铣床加工为十六小时，电脉冲加工后钳工打光模膛时间约为十二小时，而铣床加工后的钳工打光时间为二十四小时。此外，利用这种机床还可以有效地修复已磨损的模具，从而节约贵重的模具钢。
    解放十年来，我国的机械工业正以一日千里之势迅速发展，使得生产上愈来愈多地要求采用各种各样的模具。模具的加工，特别是锻压模等成型模膛的加工，到目前为止，一般是利用靠模铣或立铣进行初步轮廓加工后，主要依靠高级钳工的大量手工劳动，用凿子剃，用砂轮打，再用细磨料研。这样不但劳动量大，而且加工周期长，深而窄的部位还不易加工。新模具磨损后，由于修复困难，往往就不再使用，因而浪费许多贵重的模具钢。许多工厂往往因为模具供应不上而影响生产的成倍增长。有些大型工厂虽然有规模很大的模具车间，用了大量机床和高级钳工仍然很难满足模具的需要。因此模具加工机械化和尽可能减少钳工的体力劳动是当前急待解决的问题。
    今后的努力方向是改进现有机床以提高加工表面的光洁度；研究大功率电脉冲加工机床以满足大型模具的生产需要，并且继续研究高频大功率脉冲加工机床。
