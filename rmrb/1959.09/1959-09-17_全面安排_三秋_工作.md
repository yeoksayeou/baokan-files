Comprehensively Arrange "Sanqiu" Work

Another year has passed and the autumn winds arrive, bringing people the joy of another bumper harvest this year and the hope for an even greater harvest next year. The "Sanqiu" (Autumn Harvest, Autumn Planting, Autumn Plowing) season, a time when every moment is precious, has arrived. Grasping this golden opportunity and doing a good job in "Sanqiu" work is the most important task for the People's Communes in the next two or three months.

The autumn harvest is the final battle to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest for the whole year; autumn planting and autumn plowing are laying the foundation for striving for a bumper harvest next year, and have a significant effect on the continued leap forward next year. This year's autumn harvest crops are generally growing well, with an earlier and more concentrated maturity period; more late autumn crops are planted, and the harvest time will inevitably be longer; autumn planting and autumn plowing also require more, faster, better and more economical planting than in previous years.

What does it mean to do a good job in "Sanqiu" work? Taking the autumn harvest as an example: it is necessary to cut well, thresh well, and dry well, and also to deliver well, distribute well, and store well; it is necessary to harvest well grain crops such as rice, millet, corn, sorghum, gaoliang, and sweet potatoes, and fiber crops such as cotton and hemp, and also to harvest well oil crops such as soybeans, peanuts, sesame, oil tea, and tung oil, and economic crops such as tobacco leaves, sugarcane, and sugar beets, and also to harvest well autumn vegetables, fruit tree products, medicinal materials and wild plants, and animal husbandry and aquaculture should not be relaxed; it is necessary to harvest well large crops, and also to harvest well small and scattered crops. Taking autumn planting as an example: it is required to sow early, sow in a timely manner, and not violate the agricultural season; to deeply plow, fertilize, irrigate, select seeds, and plant densely according to local conditions; and also to expand the planting area on the principle of not affecting next year's spring planting, and plant all the land that can be planted in autumn. Autumn plowing means striving to plow all the winter fallow fields once, and not leave any hardened fields for the winter; and to make as deep plowing as possible according to different conditions, and the area of deep plowing should preferably reach more than one-half of all the winter fallow fields.

How can we do a good job in "Sanqiu" work? The most important thing is to strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the working method of the mass line, and rationally arrange and organize labor.

After the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were transmitted to the vast rural areas, raging flames of struggle for increasing production and practicing economy were ignited in all directions: many places have set off a new upsurge of production, and the ultra-contracting movement is being carried out vigorously; labor competitions are becoming more and more extensive and in-depth; field management measures to strive for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops have been repeatedly stepped up. The Party committees at all levels held high the glorious banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and led hundreds of millions of peasants to advance bravely. In order to do a better job in autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, we must raise the banner of politics even higher. We must further strengthen the combat effectiveness of the Party's grassroots organizations; we must further tell the masses about the current favorable situation and the bright future; we must combine the specific requirements for doing a better job in this year's "Sanqiu" work with the overall goal of socialist construction, and publicize it to the masses. We must use various facts to compare, so that the masses clearly realize that as long as they work hard under the leadership of the Party, agricultural production will surely rise year after year, and can develop at a high speed. Some people have a misunderstanding that "seeking truth from facts" means the lower the target, the better. This misunderstanding must be broken. Based on objective possibilities, give full play to subjective initiative, and what can be done must be done with the greatest effort. When formulating the targets and measures for autumn-sown crops, we must meet the requirements of the General Line of exerting all-out efforts, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. At the same time, we must educate cadres and the masses to resolutely obey the state plan, complete the task of harvesting and selling various agricultural and sideline products according to the state plan, and do a good job in sowing according to the planned planting area of various crops. It should be understood that there should be a certain proportion between all fronts, all walks of life, and various crops, and they should be developed in a planned and comprehensive balance in order to meet the diverse needs of national construction and people's lives. We must adhere to putting politics in command, take a broad and long-term view, take the overall situation into consideration, so that the manpower, material resources, land resources, and financial resources of the People's Communes can be brought into the fullest play and most reasonably adapted to the requirements of planned and proportionate development.

The rational arrangement and organization of labor is a concrete guarantee for doing a good job in Sanqiu work. This year, the People's Communes have more favorable conditions than last year in terms of rationally arranging and organizing labor: the People's Commune, this powerful social organization, has become more sound and consolidated; the cadres at all levels of the commune have gained experience in leading and organizing large-scale collective production in the past year, and the planning of production has also become stronger. Therefore, the commune is fully capable of arranging production and organizing labor more rationally and properly than last year, and doing the "Sanqiu" work according to higher standards.

When arranging production and organizing labor, we must accept last year's experiences and lessons, and make preparations for autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing work in advance. In advance, we must arrange the agricultural work in order according to the principle of overall planning and consideration; we must understand clearly when to do what work, how big the task is, how much labor, livestock power, and tools are needed, and make plans to do it. All the work that can be done in advance should be done as early as possible; this can not only avoid delaying the farming season due to delayed work, but also prevent the "Sanqiu" work from being too tight because some work is done in advance, and can also free up hands to vigorously carry out water conservancy construction and develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production after the "Sanqiu" work is completed. This year, many communes have prepared for the autumn harvest and autumn planting in advance while fighting drought to protect the autumn harvest or strengthening late-stage field management: leveling the ground, adding and repairing farm tools, repairing warehouses and roads, carrying out summer plowing and accumulating fertilizer. For example, Xiaodong Management District of Sumigou People's Commune in Huadian County, Jilin Province, accepted the lessons learned from last year's insufficient estimation of the autumn bumper harvest, insufficient preparation, and loss and waste of 60,000 jin of grain, and prepared early according to the characteristics of this year's autumn harvest. At the end of August, it repaired five carts, leveled eleven farm yards, and 80% of the members bought new scythes. The more work done in advance, the more active the subsequent work will be.

When arranging production and organizing labor, we must have an overall perspective. Not only should there be a reasonable arrangement for the order of work, but also a reasonable arrangement for various tasks carried out at the same time. That is to say, we must take into account the relationship between autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, between various crops, and between agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. "Sanqiu" work is the main task at present, and of course, sufficient labor should be guaranteed in this regard first. However, at the same time, we must also take care of other aspects and not completely squeeze out the labor required for vegetables, fruits, and some sideline productions that cannot be stopped. This means that while concentrating the main force to do the "Sanqiu" work, we must also allocate appropriate forces to take care of other work. Of course, when "Sanqiu" is tense, some minor and postponable things should be suspended to ensure the labor needed for "Sanqiu". Between autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, labor should also be allocated according to the size, urgency, and priority of the tasks at that time and place. When the autumn harvest task is very heavy and time is very urgent, most of the labor force can be used to storm the autumn harvest; when the autumn harvest is basically over and the autumn planting is urgent, most of the force should be used for autumn planting; after the autumn harvest and autumn planting are basically over, the labor force should be transferred to the autumn plowing of winter fallow land and other work. Between various crops, the allocation of labor should also be reasonable. Generally speaking, grain crops have a large planting area and require more labor, so we should first ensure that the labor required for the autumn harvest and autumn planting of grain crops is met; at the same time, we should also allocate appropriate labor to harvest and plant economic crops and oil crops well. Never grasp this end and lose that end. There are also many items in the autumn harvest and autumn planting work itself. The autumn harvest includes harvesting, threshing, transportation, storage, and storage, and the autumn planting also includes plowing, fertilization, seed selection, and sowing. Reasonable arrangements should also be made so that each agricultural task has someone responsible for it.

We should also pay attention to saving labor, improving labor efficiency, and giving full play to the role of each labor force. One of the methods is to arrange suitable work according to the strength and skill level of each labor force; at the same time, we must resolutely run the collective living welfare undertakings well and make reasonable allocation of the labor force required for these undertakings. The second is to actively carry out tool reforms; at the same time, continue to carry out high-efficiency labor movement. If machinery can be used to replace manual labor, we must find ways to use machinery. The harvesting and sowing tools that have been successfully tested in last year's autumn harvest and autumn planting and this year's summer harvest and summer planting should continue to play their role in this year's autumn harvest and autumn planting. Other tasks that can be completed incidentally can be completed in conjunction with the main tasks to save manpower.

When solving the problem of insufficient labor, the commune can also give full play to the superiority of its large organization scale, wide range of activities, and unified arrangement and deployment of labor and livestock power in a larger scope. According to the size and urgency of the "Sanqiu" work tasks in each management area and production team, organize cooperation between management areas and production teams on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. If necessary, cooperation on a larger scale and large-scale corps operations can also be organized. Of course, even in the case of large-scale cooperation and large-scale corps operations, we must act in accordance with the production responsibility system to improve the quality of various tasks.

We believe that as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the mass line, strengthen organizational leadership, rationally organize labor, effectively use labor, everyone exerts all their efforts, and every team strives to be the best, this year's "Sanqiu" work will definitely be done better and will definitely be completed victoriously ahead of schedule!

### 全面安排“三秋”工作

    全面安排“三秋”工作
    一年容易又秋风，给人们带来今年又一次丰收的喜悦和明年更大丰收的希望的“三秋”（秋收、秋种、秋耕）季节到来了。抓紧这一刻千金的时机，做好“三秋”工作，是人民公社在最近两三个月内最重要的任务。
    秋收是争取全年全面丰产丰收的最后一仗；秋种、秋耕则是为争取明年大丰收打基础，对明年的继续跃进有重大的作用。今年秋收作物普遍生长良好，成熟期较早较集中；晚秋作物种得多，收获的时间势必拉长；秋种和秋耕也要求比往年种得更多更快更好更省。
    怎样才算做好了“三秋”工作呢？以秋收来说：既要做到割好、打好、晒好，又要做到交售好、分配好、保管好；既要收好水稻、谷子、玉米、高粱、糜子、薯类等粮食作物和棉花、麻类等纤维作物，也要收好大豆、花生、芝麻、油茶、油桐等油料作物和烟叶、甘蔗、甜菜等经济作物，还要收好秋菜、果树产品、药材和野生植物，对畜牧和水产也不可放松；既要收好大宗作物，也要收好零星小宗作物。以秋种来说：要求提早下种，适时下种，不违农时；要因地制宜合理地深耕、施肥、灌水、选种、密植；还要在不影响明年春种的原则下扩大播种面积，把能够秋种的地全部种上。以秋耕来说，就是力求把所有的冬闲田普耕一遍，不要留板田过冬；而且要根据不同条件尽可能做到深耕，深耕的面积最好能达到全部冬闲田的二分之一以上。
    怎样才能做好“三秋”工作呢？最要紧的还是加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线的工作方法，合理地安排和组织劳动力。
    党的八届八中全会的决议传到广大农村以后，在四面八方点起了为增产节约而斗争的熊熊烈火：许多地方掀起了新的生产高潮，超包产运动开展得轰轰烈烈；劳动竞赛愈来愈广泛、愈深入；争取晚秋作物丰收的田间管理措施一再加码。各级党委高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，领导着几亿农民奋勇前进。为了把秋收、秋种、秋耕工作做得更好，必须把政治的帅旗更高地举起。要进一步加强党的基层组织的战斗性；要进一步向群众大讲当前的有利形势和今后的光明前途；要把今年“三秋”工作做得更好的具体要求同社会主义建设的总目标结合起来，向群众进行宣传。要用各种各样的事实来对比，使群众清楚地认识到，只要在党的领导下鼓足干劲，农业生产就一定能年年上升，而且可以高速度地发展。在一些人中间有一种误解，认为“实事求是”就是指标愈低愈好。这种误解必须打破。根据客观可能性，充分发挥主观能动性，能够做到的事情，就一定要用最大的努力争取做到。在制定秋播作物的指标和措施的时候，一定要符合总路线的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省的要求。同时，要教育干部和群众坚决服从国家计划，按照国家计划完成收获和交售各种农副产品的任务，按照计划规定的各种作物的种植面积做好播种工作。应当了解：各条战线、各行各业、各种作物之间都应当有一定的比例，应当有计划地综合平衡发展，以便满足国家建设和人民生活的多种多样的需要。必须坚持政治挂帅，高瞻远瞩，统筹全局，使人民公社的人力、物力、地力、财力最充分地发挥作用，最合理地适应按计划按比例发展的要求。
    合理地安排和组织劳动力，是做好三秋工作的具体保证。今年，各人民公社在合理安排和组织劳动力方面，已经有了比去年更为有利的条件：人民公社这个强大的社会组织已经更加健全和巩固；公社的各级干部在一年来的生产中，已经取得了领导和组织大集体生产的经验，生产的计划性也更强了。因此，公社完全有可能比去年更加合理地更加妥善地安排生产、组织劳动力，把“三秋”工作按照更高的标准做好。
    在安排生产组织劳动力的时候，要接受去年的经验和教训，对秋收、秋种、秋耕工作提早作好准备。事先，要按照统筹兼顾的原则，把农活排一下队；什么时候该做什么工作，任务有多大，需要多少劳力、畜力、工具等等，要了解清楚，订出计划去做。凡是能够提前做的工作，要尽量往前赶；这样既可避免因工作拖后而违误农时，又可因部分工作提前了使“三秋”工作不致过分紧张，还可以在赶完了“三秋”工作以后腾出手来大力兴修水利，发展林业、牧业、副业、渔业生产。今年，不少公社在抗旱保秋或加强后期田间管理的同时，就提前为秋收秋种作了准备：平整场地、添置和修补农具、整修仓库和道路、进行伏耕和积肥造肥等。如吉林桦甸苏密沟人民公社晓东管理区，今年接受了去年对秋季大丰收估计不足、准备工作不充分、损失浪费了六万斤粮食的教训，早就根据今年秋收的特点作了准备，在8月末就修理了大车五辆，平出了十一个场园，80％的社员都新买了镰刀。提前做的工作越多，以后的工作就越主动。
    在安排生产、组织劳动力的时候，要有全面观点。不但对工作的先后次序要有合理的安排，还要对同时进行的各项工作作合理的安排。就是说要照顾到秋收、秋种、秋耕之间，各种作物之间，农业和林、牧、副、渔等业之间的关系。“三秋”工作是当前主要的任务，首先当然应当保证在这方面有足够的劳动力。但是，同时也要照顾到其他方面，不要把蔬菜、水果及一些不能停的副业生产所需的劳动力完全挤掉。这就是说，在集中主要力量去做“三秋”工作的时候，也要分配适当的力量去照顾其他工作。当然，在“三秋”紧张的时候，一些次要的、可以缓办的事情，还是应该暂停一下，以保证“三秋”所需要的劳力。在秋收、秋种、秋耕之间，也要根据当时当地任务的大小和轻重缓急来调配劳动力。在秋收任务很大、时间又很紧急的时候，就可以用大部分劳动力去突击秋收；当秋收已基本结束、秋种正在紧急的时候，就应当用大部分力量去进行秋种；秋收秋种都基本结束以后，就应当把劳动力转到冬闲地的秋耕和其他工作上去。在各种作物之间，劳力分配也要合理。一般来说粮食作物播种面积大，需要的劳力较多，应当首先保证满足粮食作物秋收秋种所需要的劳力；同时，也要分配适当的劳动力去收好种好经济作物和油料作物。决不可抓住这头丢了那头。就是秋收秋种工作本身的项目也很多，秋收就有收割、打场、运输、入仓、保管等工作，秋种也有耕地、送肥、选种、播种等工作，也应当作合理的安排，使每一样农活都有人负责。
    还要注意节约劳动力，提高劳动效率，使每个劳动力充分发挥作用。办法之一是根据每个劳动力的强弱、技术高低安排合适的工作；同时要把集体生活福利事业坚决办好，并且对这些事业所需要的劳动力作合理的调配。二是积极进行工具改革；同时继续开展高工效运动。能够用机械代替人力操作的要想办法用机械操作。在去年秋收秋种和今年夏收夏种工作中已试验成功的收种工具，在今年的秋收秋种工作中要让它们继续发挥作用。能够捎带完成的其他任务可以结合主要任务一起来完成，以节省人力。
    在解决劳动力不足的问题的时候，公社还可以充分发挥组织规模大、活动范围广、能够在更大范围内统一安排和调度劳力畜力的优越性，根据各管理区、生产队“三秋”工作任务的大小、缓急，在互助互利的原则下，组织管理区、生产队之间的协作。必要时，还可以组织更大范围内的协作和大兵团作战。当然，即使在大协作、大兵团作战的情况下，也要按照生产责任制度办事，提高各项工作的质量。
    我们相信，只要坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，加强组织领导，合理地组织劳动力，有效地使用劳动力，人人鼓足干劲，队队力争上游，今年的“三秋”工作一定可以做得更好，一定可以提前胜利完成！
