To celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Ministry of Culture will hold a National New Film Exhibition Month in twenty-seven cities across the country, starting from September 25th. At the same time, a batch of new domestic films will be screened in factories, mines, and rural areas nationwide. The exhibition includes seventeen color feature films, three color large-scale documentaries, four short documentaries, four color animated films, and seven color science education films. Over three thousand six hundred copies of the new films will be screened in factories, mines, and rural areas. This is a gift from the national film workers to the National Day and a significant leap forward and a great harvest for Chinese cinematic art.

Compared with the past, the new films of various styles participating in this exhibition and screening have shown significant improvements in ideological and artistic quality. The range of themes has expanded, not only truthfully reflecting the lives and struggles of the Chinese people in various historical periods from the Opium War to the socialist construction Great Leap Forward, but also extensively representing themes in various aspects such as workers, peasants, merchants, students, soldiers, fraternal nationalities, women, children, culture and education, science, and sports. Due to the implementation of the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the styles have also become more diverse.

From the new films participating in this exhibition, we can see a very clear feature, that is, our film workers have always consistently adhered to the Marxist-Leninist principle that film art must serve politics and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. These films have a wide range of themes and different styles, but they all strive to use the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism to reflect and depict the lives, struggles, and aspirations of the people. Because of this, the historical biographical film "Lin Zexu" not only reflects objective historical truth, but is also full of strong patriotic spirit; the film "The Hui Muslim Detachment" depicting the War of Resistance Against Japan does not pursue intense war scenes, but simply uses a war theme to truthfully depict the process of the Hui people gradually moving from spontaneity to consciousness under the leadership of the Party; "Song of Youth" depicts the story of the joys and sorrows of an intellectual youth, but our artists did not rely on twists and turns in the plot to achieve dramatic effects, but focused on guiding the audience's emotions to a strong pursuit of the new society and a firm farewell to the old life. And look at our documentaries "Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness," "Locking Up the Yellow Dragon," and "The Green Wilderness." These documentaries all have a common, distinct protagonist, that is, the hardworking, intelligent, and brave people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people who are making the mountains bow their heads and the rivers make way, the people who are changing the face of the motherland's nature. In our documentaries, the characteristic of "visual political commentary" is also very prominent.

Of course, we should not be satisfied with the achievements we have made. The broad masses of people and friends abroad all hope that our films can reach a higher level. However, the Western bourgeois film critics and some people in China who are opposed to socialism have ulterior motives in their attacks on the films of New China. They often accuse our films of being "too political and too poor in artistic quality." In our opinion, the former is precisely the advantage of our films. Our films are the fighting weapons of the proletariat and the loyal assistants of the Party. Serving the politics of the proletariat is the glorious duty of our films. In this regard, we are not doing too much, but not enough. Our shortcoming is definitely not "too much politics," but because film is still relatively young in China, many film workers lack experience and have not fully grasped the creative laws of film art. Therefore, we often cannot do a good job of closely combining politics and art. We do not shy away from shortcomings in art and technology, but these shortcomings can be completely overcome. We are working hard and with full confidence to improve the artistic level of the films. And, it is gratifying that many of the films participating in this exhibition can prove that in recent years, Chinese films have also made significant improvements and progress in art and technology.

Not long ago, some right-leaning opportunists doubted our general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and wanted to negate the achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward. In the film industry, there were also people with this kind of sentiment and thought. Therefore, holding such a large-scale New Film Exhibition Month during the vigorous mass movement of opposing rightism and boosting morale will be of great significance. The more than thirty new films participating in the exhibition vividly demonstrate the Great Leap Forward and great harvest of Chinese films, and this leap forward and harvest were achieved under the brilliant illumination of the general line and on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. Without the general line and without the Great Leap Forward, it would be impossible to double or more than double the annual output of films, to greatly reduce the production time and cost of films, and to significantly improve the ideological and artistic quality of the films. Therefore, we believe that this New Film Exhibition is not only a gift to the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, but also has extremely profound educational significance for all our film workers. This is an exhibition to answer right-leaning opportunists, this is an exhibition against rightism and to boost morale, and this is an exhibition to encourage our film workers to continue to leap forward.

We know that climbing the peak of cinematic art is by no means an easy task. Now, we are just a new recruit in the climbing team. Being young, we inevitably lack maturity, but what makes us happy is that this young recruit, nurtured under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, has the soaring enthusiasm to overcome difficulties. Enthusiasm plus learning—learning Marxism-Leninism, learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, studying diligently, and advancing bravely—then we believe that we will definitely be able to gradually approach this peak.

### 向电影艺术的高峰迈进

    向电影艺术的高峰迈进
    夏衍
    为了庆祝伟大的建国十周年，从9月25日起，文化部将在全国二十七个城市举办国产新片展览月，同时，也将在全国工矿、农村放映一批国产新片。参加这次展览的有彩色故事片十七部，彩色大型纪录片三部，短纪录片四部，彩色美术片四部，彩色科学教育片七部，在工矿农村放映的新片拷贝将达三千六百个以上，这是全国电影工作者向国庆的献礼，这也是我国电影艺术的一次很大的跃进、很大的丰收。
    参加这次展览放映的各种样式的新片，和过去比较起来，思想性和艺术性都有了显著的提高。题材的范围扩大了，不仅真实地反映了从鸦片战争到社会主义建设大跃进各个历史时期中国人民的生活和斗争，而且广泛地表现了工、农、商、学、兵，兄弟民族，妇女、儿童，文教、科学、体育等各个方面的主题。由于贯彻了党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，在样式和风格上，也显得更加丰富多采了。
    从参加这次展览的新片中我们可以看出一个很鲜明的特征，这就是我们的电影工作者始终一贯地坚持着电影艺术必须为政治服务、为工农兵服务这一个马克思列宁主义的原则。这些影片题材广泛，样式风格不同，可是它们都力求用革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，来反映和刻划人民群众的生活、斗争和愿望。由于这样，历史传记片“林则徐”不只是反映了客观的历史真实，而且充满了强烈的爱国主义精神；描写抗日战争的
  “回民支队”并不追求剧烈的战争场面，而只是通过一个战争题材，真实地刻划了回民群众在党的领导下逐渐地从自发到自觉的过程；“青春之歌”描写了一个知识青年的悲欢离合的故事，可是我们的艺术家并没有借重曲折的情节来取得戏剧效果，而着力地把观众的感情引导到对新社会的强烈的追求，和对旧生活的坚决的诀别。再看看我们的纪录片“英雄战胜北大荒”、“锁住黄龙”和“绿色的原野”吧，这些纪录片里都有一个共同的性格鲜明的主角，这就是中国共产党领导下的勤劳、智慧、勇敢的人民，是人民在使高山低头、河水让路，是人民在使祖国的自然改变面貌。在我们的纪录片里，“形象的政论”这个特点也是很突出的。
    当然，我们完全不应该满足于已有的成绩，广大人民和国外的朋友都希望我们的电影能够达到更高的水平。但是，西方的资产阶级电影评论家和国内的一些对社会主义抱反感的人，他们对新中国的电影的攻击，却是别有用心的。他们经常指责我们的电影“政治性太强、艺术性太差”。在我们看来，前者正是我们的电影的优点。我们的电影是无产阶级的战斗武器，是党的忠实助手，为无产阶级的政治服务，是我们的电影的光荣职责，在这方面，我们不是做得太多，而是还做得很不够。我们的缺点决不是“政治性太强”，而是由于电影在中国还比较年轻，许多电影工作者经验不足，还没有充分掌握电影艺术的创作规律，因此，还往往不能很好地做到政治性同艺术性的密切结合。我们毫不讳言艺术、技术方面的缺点，但这些缺点是完全可以克服的，我们正在鼓足干劲，满怀信心地为提高影片的艺术水平而努力，并且，值得高兴的，是参加这次展览的许多影片可以证明，近几年来，中国电影在艺术、技术方面也有了显著的提高和进步。
    不久之前，一些右倾机会主义分子对我们鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义这一条总路线发生怀疑，并想否定去年大跃进的成就，在电影界，具有这种情绪和思想的人也不是没有。那么，在轰轰烈烈的反右倾、鼓干劲的群众运动中，举行这样一次规模巨大的新片展览月，将会有很重要的意义。参加展览的三十多部新片生动地证明了中国电影的大跃进、大丰收，而这一跃进和丰收，正是在总路线的光辉照耀下，在去年大跃进的基础上取得的。没有总路线，没有大跃进，要把电影的年产量增加一倍乃至一倍以上，要使电影的摄制时间和成本大大缩减而又使影片的思想、艺术质量显著提高，是不可能的。因此我们认为这次的新片展览除出向伟大的建国十周年献礼之外，对我们全体电影工作者来说，也还有极其深刻的教育意义。这是回答右倾机会主义者的展出，这是反右倾、鼓干劲的展出，这是鼓舞我们电影工作者继续跃进的展出。
    我们知道，要攀登电影艺术的高峰，决不是一件容易的事情，现在，我们还只是爬山队伍中的一支新兵。年轻，就不免幼稚，但是值得使我们高兴的是我们这一支年轻的、在毛泽东同志的培养下成长起来的新兵具有不怕困难的冲天干劲。干劲再加学习——学习马克思列宁主义，学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验，刻苦钻研，奋勇前进，那么我们相信，我们是一定能够逐渐地和这座高峰接近的。
