When the Red Flag is Planted on the Moon...
Shi Ming

This is another world-shaking moment: the second cosmic rocket bearing the Soviet national emblem has reached the moon!

In the West, scientists, radio stations, reporters, and politicians held their breath with tension; then came a chorus of praise, surprise, and helplessness, busy issuing all kinds of needed comments—even resorting to the language of the "Cold War."

At 10:02:30 PM London Summer Time, the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Britain first announced the news that the lunar rocket had reached the moon. An NBC reporter immediately made a wireless telephone call back from London. Washington radio programs were completely interrupted at 9:11:30 PM Greenwich Time, and the "New York Times" radio station also interrupted a symphony broadcast to broadcast the Soviet Union's new astonishing achievement.

At this time, although the rocket's signal had stopped, the Western reports on the rocket were deafening. London, New York...all newspapers followed with bold fonts and front-page status to publish the miracle of the red rocket appearing on another celestial body. "The Times" placed the headline "Russia Announces Arrival on the Moon" next to the masthead with "rare honor."

The most authoritative Western scientists and scientific organizations such as the Interstellar Society congratulated Soviet scientists, offering "divine shot," "new era," and other praise...

However, Western politicians have other clever ways to deal with it... White House Press Secretary Hagerty didn't have time to prepare what to say, so he had to say the old line: "I have nothing to add to what I said yesterday."

Vice President Nixon was rushing to the "New York National Dental Convention" to deliver a speech, and stubbornly said: "There is no evidence" that the rocket actually hit the moon. Not only that, but he also asserted that even if it did..., there was "nothing to be alarmed about," and "overall, we are ahead."

Former US President Truman said more bluntly: unless he saw the rocket go to the moon with his own eyes, he would not believe it. But he did not say whether he had applied to the Soviet Union to ride a rocket to the moon.

Lloyd also made a "joke" with gentlemanly demeanor: "I don't think there are many people who are extremely interested in it (referring to the lunar rocket)."

I don't know which mischievous reporter called Adenauer's official residence, and the reply was: "The Prime Minister is asleep and cannot be disturbed." In any case, this is the smartest answer.

The "New York Times" accurately grasped the political wind and published a very authoritative editorial on the 14th. The author first had to admit: "The Soviet people have the right to be proud of achieving this historically significant achievement." But then, the author immediately lowered his face and indicated that his praise was from a scientific point of view, and what about "evaluating" it in "political terms"? That's so terrible!

This American newspaper immediately associated it with Khrushchev's visit to the United States: "Obviously, Premier Khrushchev hopes that this great achievement will help his mission when he arrives in our country tomorrow." Then, the author warned: "We hope he will not have any wrong ideas, thinking that this new action demonstrating his country's rocket capabilities will weaken our determination to uphold our principles."

What "principles" are these referring to? Are they the principles of Eisenhower's repeated desire to melt the ice? If so, what is there to be afraid of? The Soviet Union's desire for peace is known to the world. People all over the world also believe that the lunar rocket is a peace rocket, which will help awaken those war maniacs who still have hot heads, and they are overjoyed by it. But the "New York Times" warning is obviously not based on the hope that the ice will melt, but quite the opposite.

Adenauer, when he woke up the next day, pointed out the hidden worries of the "New York Times," he wanted people to believe that "the United States is ahead of the Soviet Union in economic and military terms." A West German newspaper, the "Evening News," said more bluntly that they "discovered" "bad omens in the political sphere," "The Soviet Premier sent a rocket to the moon, it seems as if he is putting a gun on the negotiating table before starting negotiations." It turns out that in the eyes of the Cold War knights, the peace rocket is so terrifying!

Not only that, but American politicians immediately associated it with the issue of the "sovereignty" of the moon.

On the 14th, a US State Department spokesperson solemnly announced when answering reporters: "Planting a flag on the moon or any other celestial body is not enough to explain sovereignty over the moon." This seems to be a ridiculous statement not without basis, Senator Mansfield produced evidence, saying: "Because the rocket is carrying the Soviet national emblem, the Soviet Union may declare sovereignty over the moon." However, fortunately it is just a Soviet national emblem, and "no one went with the national emblem," otherwise, it would "become complicated."

This is not a discussion in a madman's diary. An Agence France-Presse reporter said that in the past, Western jurists had already raised the "issue of space rights" at interstellar navigation conferences. There is indeed such a thing. When the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial earth satellite in October 1957, the American international law expert Haley stated at an international interstellar navigation conference held in Barcelona, Spain, that in order to prevent the Soviet Union from first entering the moon, he suggested declaring the moon as a "free and independent autonomous region," and that the arrival of "space travelers should be prohibited," "unless they are invited to land." Another American international law expert, James Mangan, further declared: the United States should own everything in outer space, and the Soviet Union's right to go to the moon is "illegal," "because they did not pass the passport of the celestial space."

Although the United States is still on Earth and cannot talk about checking passports on the moon, the United States has included its combat plan on the moon in the US Pentagon's combat plan on Earth. In March of this year, at a meeting of the House Space Committee, General Twining, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that US military personnel have been considering "the possibility of stationing troops and missiles in orbit around the moon for use in the event of a war" for some time.

In this way, people understand that the United States' fear of the lunar rocket is not only because they are worried that this peace rocket will bring greater pressure to the United States' policy of persisting in the Cold War on Earth, but also because they are worried that the red flag flying on the moon will completely shatter the war maniacs' fantasies of turning the moon into an American military base.

The Soviet lunar rocket prevents even bacteria from being brought to the moon, but the American war maniacs want to bring hydrogen bombs to the moon. Unfortunately, as the saying goes, these people's hands are too short, their combat plans on Earth are gradually moving towards the verge of complete bankruptcy, as for fighting on the moon, I'm sorry, the United States can only sigh at the moon now.

The moon, what a beautiful symbol of fantasy, ideals, and happiness. Today, on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the red flag is flying on the moon again, which makes it look particularly bright and endearing. However, vampires have such a hateful attitude towards the moon!

    当红旗插到月球的时候……
    史明
    这是又一次震动世界的时刻：带有苏联国徽的第二个宇宙火箭到达了月球！
    在西方，科学家、电台、记者和政治家怀着紧张的心情屏息以待；然后是一片的赞扬、惊奇、手足无措，忙于发出各种各样合乎需要的议论——一直到不惜使用“冷战”的语言。
    伦敦夏令时间下午十点零两分半，英国焦德雷耳班克天文台首先发出月球火箭到达月球的消息。美国全国广播公司记者立即从伦敦打回无线电话。华盛顿电台的节目在格林威治时间二十一点十一分半全部中断，“纽约时报”的电台也中断了一个交响乐的广播节目，广播苏联的新的惊人成就。
    这时，火箭的讯号虽然停止了，但西方报道火箭的电讯声音却震耳欲聋。伦敦的、纽约的……所有报纸随之以粗字体、首页地位争载红色火箭在另一天体出现的奇迹。“泰晤士报”以“少见的荣誉”把“俄国宣布到达月球”的大标题排在报头的旁边。
    最权威的西方科学家和星际学会之类的科学团体纷纷向苏联科学家祝贺，致以“神射”、“新纪元”等等的赞词……
    但是，西方政治家却另有巧妙的应付之道……白宫新闻发布官哈格蒂来不及准备说些什么，只好说老话：“除了我昨天所说的以外，无可奉告”。
    尼克松副总统正赶到“纽约全国牙科大会”发表演说，硬起头皮说：“还没有证据”证明火箭确实击中了月球。这样还不够，他又断言，即使……，也没有“什么值得大惊小怪的”，“总的来说，我们走在前面”。
    前美国总统杜鲁门说得更干脆：除非他亲眼看见火箭上月球，否则他不相信。但他没有说他是否向苏联申请乘坐火箭到月球去。
    劳埃德还开了一个有绅士风度的“玩笑”：“我并不认为有许多人对它（指月球火箭）极感兴趣”。
    不知哪一位恶作剧的记者，把电话打到阿登纳的官邸，回话是：“总理睡着了，不可以打扰他”。无论如何，这是最聪明的回答。
    “纽约时报”摸准了政治家的风向，在14日发表一篇十分权威的社论。作者首先不能不承认：“苏联人民有权以取得这项具有历史意义的成就而感到自豪”。但接着，社论的作者立即沉下了脸，表明他的这个称赞是从科学的角度出发的，而在“政治方面”“加以估价”呢？那是多么可怕呀！
    这家美国报纸立即联想到赫鲁晓夫访问美国：“显然，赫鲁晓夫总理希望这一巨大成就对他在明天到达我们的国土所执行的使命有所帮助”。然后，作者警告说：“我们希望他不要产生什么错误的见解，以为这种显示他的国家的火箭能力的新行动会使我们维护我们原则的决心有所削弱”。
    这是指的什么“原则”呢？是艾森豪威尔所一再表示的愿使冰块融解的原则吗？如果是，那又怕什么呢？苏联的和平愿望是举世皆知的。全世界人民也是认为，月球火箭是和平火箭，有助于唤醒那些至今头脑发热的战争狂人，他们并为此而欢欣鼓舞。但“纽约时报”的警告，显然不是基于希望冰块融解，而是恰恰相反。
    阿登纳在第二天醒来时，就点破了“纽约时报”的隐忧，他要人们相信“美国在经济和军事方面走在苏联的前面”。西德的一家报纸“午报”说得更露骨，它们“发见”了“政治方面的不良预兆”，“苏联总理把火箭送上月球，看来仿佛是在开始谈判前把一支手枪放在谈判桌上”。原来，在冷战骑士们看来，和平火箭竟是如此吓人的呢！
    不仅如此，美国的政治家还立刻联想到月球的“主权”问题。
    美国国务院发言人14日回答记者时郑重其事地宣布：“在月球上或者任何其它天体上插旗并不足以说明对月球有主权”。这看来似乎并非毫无根据的可笑之谈，美国参议员曼斯菲尔德就拿出了证据，他说：“由于火箭上带着苏联国徽，苏联可能会宣布对月球有主权”。不过，好在不过是一面苏联国徽，而还“没有人同国徽一起去”，否则，这就要“变得复杂”了。
    这不是狂人日记里的议论。法新社记者说，在过去，西方的法学家们早已在星际航行会议上就提出过“空间权利问题”。的确有这么一回事。当1957年10月苏联发射成功第一个人造地球卫星的时候，美国的国际法学家哈莱就曾在西班牙巴塞罗那举行的一次国际星际航行会议上表示过，为了防止苏联首先进入月球，他建议宣布月球为“自由和独立的自治地区”，“应当禁止空间旅行者”的到来，“除非他们是应邀着陆”。美国另一个国际法学家詹姆斯·曼甘更进一步宣布：美国应对外层空间的一切拥有所有权，苏联要到月球上去的权利是“非法”的，“因为他们没有通过天体空间的护照”。
    虽然，美国还在地球上，而远远谈不到在月球上检查护照，但美国已把它在月球上的作战计划列入了美国五角大楼在地球上的作战计划之中了。今年3月间，在众议院空间委员会的一次会议上，美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁将军说，美国军方人员若干时候以来一直在考虑“在月球周围的轨道上驻扎军队和导弹以供万一发生战争之用的可能性”。
    这样一来，人们就想通了，原来美国对月球火箭的恐惧，不仅是担心这支和平火箭会给美国坚持在地球上进行冷战的政策带来更大的压力，而且担心在月球上飘起的红旗会使那些战争狂人们把月球变为美国军事基地的狂想完全粉碎。
    苏联的月球火箭连细菌都防止带到月球上去，但美国的战争狂人却要把氢弹带到月球上去。可惜，俗话说得好，这些人的手太短了，他们在地球上的作战计划都一步一步地走向彻底破产的边缘，至于在月球上作战，更是对不起，美国现在还只能望月兴叹。
    月亮，这是多么美丽的幻梦、理想和幸福的象征。今天，正值中秋佳节前夕，月球上又飘扬着红旗，更是显得分外明媚，令人爱慕。可是，吸血鬼们却对月亮抱着多么可憎可恨的态度呵！
