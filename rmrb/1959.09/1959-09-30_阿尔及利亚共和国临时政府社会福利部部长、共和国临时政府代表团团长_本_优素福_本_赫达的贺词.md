Mr. Chairman Mao Zedong, Mr. Chairman Liu Shaoqi, dear friends,

We are greatly honored to be here on behalf of the Algerian Provisional Government and all the Algerian people to pay tribute to the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

This tenth anniversary of the National Day has extremely lofty significance.

During these ten years, China has not only completely shaken off the semi-feudal and semi-colonial state of the past, but also, due to the hard work of the Chinese people and the high spirit of serving the people by its leaders, China has made amazing progress in all aspects, making it one of the largest and strongest countries in the world.

Faced with this extraordinary development, we Algerians feel heartfelt joy, a development brought about by the selfless struggle of the people and the wise leadership of the leaders.

Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has resolutely expressed its support for the freedom of the people of all countries. It is indeed the most reliable ally of the oppressed people who are fighting colonialism and imperialism under conditions of unequal strength.

Every victory the Chinese people have achieved in the peaceful construction of their country makes the imperialists tremble today. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese people is also our victory.

We are gratified by China's support for the Algerian liberation cause. The Algerian people, like the people of all African nations, will never forget that the People's Republic of China was one of the first countries to recognize our Algerian Provisional Government.

With the support of the People's Republic of China and other countries that oppose imperialism, the Algerian people's struggle for national independence, which is more determined than ever, will surely be victorious.

Neither the bullets and shells created by the French imperialists in collusion with the West on our territory, nor the political tactics and fraud that dying colonialism wants to carry out, can make the Algerian people bow their heads.

The Algerian people love peace, but they know that peace can only be achieved through a resolute and unremitting struggle against imperialism and for liberation and national independence.

Dear friends!

International conditions are becoming more and more conducive to the easing of the international situation and world peace.

We are convinced that this situation is conducive to the cause of the people of those countries who are fighting against colonial rule.

On the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we come to celebrate this festival with our Chinese friends, marking the beginning of a new era, the characteristic of which will be the consolidation of peace and the failure of imperialists and warmongers!

Long live the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

Long live peace and the friendship of the people of all countries!

    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府社会福利部部长、共和国临时政府代表团团长
    本·优素福·本·赫达的贺词毛泽东主席先生，刘少奇主席先生，亲爱的朋友们，
    我们能以阿尔及利亚临时政府和全体阿尔及利亚人民的名义来此向伟大的中华人民共和国建国十周年致敬，使我们感到非常荣幸。
    这个十年国庆具有极其崇高的意义。
    在这十年期间，中国不仅完全摆脱了过去的半封建半殖民地的状态，并且由于中国人民的勤奋劳动及其领导人们的高度为人民服务的精神，中国又在各方面获得了惊人的进步，从而使它跃登世界最大的强国之列。
    面对这种异乎寻常的发展，我们阿尔及利亚人感到由衷的喜悦，这种发展是人民的忘我的奋斗和领袖们的英明领导所造成的。
    中华人民共和国自从建立以来，就决然表示拥护各国人民的自由。它的确是被压迫人民的最可靠的同盟者，这些人民正在力量悬殊的条件之下和殖民主义、帝国主义作斗争。
    中国人民在他们国家的和平建设中所取得的每一个胜利，在今天都使帝国主义者发抖。因此，中国人民的胜利也就是我们的胜利。
    中国对阿尔及利亚解放事业的支持，使我们感到庆幸。阿尔及利亚人民，和非洲各族人民一样，永远不会忘记中华人民共和国是最先承认我们阿尔及利亚临时政府的国家之一。
    在人民中国和别的反对帝国主义的国家的支持之下，阿尔及利亚人民空前坚决地争取民族独立的斗争是一定会胜利的。
    无论是和西方的同谋勾结一起的法帝国主义者在我们国土上所造成的枪林弹雨，或是垂死的殖民主义要什么政治手腕和进行欺诈，都不能够使阿尔及利亚人民低头。
  阿尔及利亚人民热爱和平，可是他们知道，首先要通过坚决的、一刻不懈的反对帝国主义、争取解放和民族独立的斗争，和平才能获得。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    国际条件越来越有利于国际局势的缓和和世界和平。
    我们深信，这种形势有利于那些正在进行反殖民统治斗争国家的人民的事业。
    在中华人民共和国的十周年国庆，我们来和中国朋友们一同欢庆这个节日，标志着一个新时代的开始，这时代的特征将是和平的巩固和帝国主义者以及战争贩子的失败！
    中华人民共和国建国十周年万岁！
    和平和各国人民的友谊万岁！（附图片）
