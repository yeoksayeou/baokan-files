    Determination of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road"

    Our company participated in the battle to liberate Shanghai and has since been responsible for defending Shanghai. During our years stationed on Nanjing Road, we inherited the glorious tradition of our army: "Loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, selfless in serving the public, and practicing austerity." Because of this, we were loved by the people of Shanghai and were called the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road."

    After reading the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, all officers and soldiers of our company were very excited. At the military meeting held here, everyone unanimously stated: We must maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition, with greater enthusiasm, go all out, support the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, respond to the Party's call to fight, and better defend and support Shanghai's socialist construction.

    Currently, our company is full of vigor. Squad Leader Dou Zhaoyu, representing the entire squad, made a guarantee to the Party: "Actively participate in the fight against drought, seize vegetables from the heavens, and hand over one thousand jin of vegetables before National Day." The breeder Chen Zairong also proposed: "Seize the time to cut pig feed to ensure that the feed cost for each pig does not exceed one yuan per month." Company Commander Deng Jinglin and Second Platoon Leader Hong Zhaoquan personally bundled and carried dried pig feed and went deep into the vegetable fields to check production. The Third Platoon Leader led two soldiers to the production team to fight drought and protect seedlings. The Party branch has meticulously studied the work for the second half of the year and put forward new indicators and measures to complete and overfulfill this year's training goals with a spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work, create greater achievements, and welcome the great 10th anniversary of National Day.

    “南京路上好八连”的决心
    我们连曾参加过解放上海的战役，以后，又担任着保卫上海的任务。在驻防南京路的几年内，我们继承了我军“忠于祖国，忠于人民，克己为公，艰苦朴素”的光荣传统，因此，受到了上海人民的爱戴，被称为“南京路上好八连”。
    当我们阅读了党的八中全会公报和决议后，全连官兵都很兴奋。在这里召开的军人大会上，大家一致表示：我们要保持和发扬光荣传统，以更大的热情，鼓足干劲，拥护党的八中全会的公报和决议，响应党的战斗号召，更好地保卫和支援上海的社会主义建设。
    目前，我们连里真是干劲冲天。五班长窦照玉代表全班向党提出了保证：“积极参加抗旱，与天夺菜，国庆节前上交蔬菜一千斤。”饲养员陈再荣也提出：“抓紧时间割猪草，保证每头猪的饲料费，每月不超过一元钱。”连长邓景林和二排长洪兆全亲自捆挑干的猪饲料，并深入菜地检查生产。三排长带领两名战士前往生产队抗旱保苗。党支部对下半年的工作，细致地作了研究，提出了新的指标和措施，要以苦干实干巧干的精神，扎扎实实地完成和超额完成今年的各项训练指标，创造更大的成绩，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
