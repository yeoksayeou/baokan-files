    A Good Woodcut
    The above color woodcut, entitled "Waiting for the Ferry," is by Xu Kuang. This is one of the works that our country participated in this year's Leipzig International Book Art Exhibition print competition.
    In the picture, amid the vast expanse of river and flickering sails, the clear images of four young surveyors are set off. They are sitting on the boat waiting for the ferry, some opening their notebooks to study, others looking up and gazing into the distance. The painting does not show the surrounding scenery or the opposite bank, nor does the author explain where they are going. However, we can imagine the intense labor they are about to begin from their serious and conscientious mood as they begin to participate in construction, and from their eyes full of confidence and hope, we can imagine the magnificent cause that these young people are throwing themselves into, and the heroic pace of the motherland's rapid progress. And from this quiet painting, we also seem to hear the roaring sound of thousands of horses galloping on the construction site. This limited painting contains broad and rich content, which is thought-provoking.
    This is a good painting that says all it needs to and suggests even more.

    一幅好木刻
    上面这幅套色木刻，题目叫“待渡”，作者徐匡。这是今年我国参加莱比锡国际书籍艺术展览会版画比赛的作品之一。
    画面上，在一片茫茫的江水和闪动的帆影里，衬托出了四位青年测量员清晰的形象。他们正坐在船上待渡，有的翻开笔记本在学习，有的昂首眺望着远方。画中没有表现出周围和对岸的景物，作者也没有交代他们要到那里去。然而，我们从他们那种由于开始参加建设而严肃认真的心情，随着他们那些充满着信心和希望的眼神，可以联想到他们将要开始的紧张劳动，联想到使这些青年人投身进去的壮丽的事业，联想到祖国一日千里的豪迈脚步。而且从这静静的画幅里，我们也仿佛听到了工地上万马奔腾的喧闹的声音。在这有限的画幅中，包含着广阔丰富的内容，耐人寻味。
    这是一幅言有尽而意无穷的好画。
