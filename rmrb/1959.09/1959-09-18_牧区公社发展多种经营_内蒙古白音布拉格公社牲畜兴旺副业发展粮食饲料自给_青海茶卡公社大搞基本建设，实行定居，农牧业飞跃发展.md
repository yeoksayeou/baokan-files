Pastoral Communes Develop Diversified Economies
Bayan Bulag Commune in Inner Mongolia Thrives with Livestock and Sideline Businesses, Achieving Self-Sufficiency in Grain and Fodder
Chaka Commune in Qinghai Undertakes Extensive Basic Construction, Implements Settlement, and Achieves Leaps in Agricultural and Pastoral Development
    (Our dispatch) Since the establishment of the Bayan Bulag (Mongolian for: Abundant Springs) People's Commune in Hangjin Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, it has fully demonstrated its enormous superiority. Livestock production has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, diversified operations have flourished, and the lives of herders have generally improved.
    The Bayan Bulag People's Commune is composed of 440 Mongolian and Han households. As soon as the commune was established, it took on the serious task of fighting against wind, snow, and cold to protect livestock and ensure their safe passage through winter and spring. Because the commune unified production, rationally arranged labor, raised livestock in separate groups, and launched a vigorous campaign of comparisons and competitions, more than 45,700 large livestock and 24,400 young livestock safely passed through the winter and spring. The breeding survival rate of livestock has greatly increased, creating the miracle of achieving a total livestock increase rate of 52% in 1959. Now, the number of livestock per household has increased from an average of 103 head last year to 150 head.
    With the establishment of the commune, labor potential has been more fully utilized. In addition to doing a good job in livestock production, diversified operations have also been carried out. People were dispatched to transport goods, extract gypsum, weave willow fences, and dig licorice for three months, generating a total income of more than 69,000 yuan. This alone amounted to an average income of more than 150 yuan per household. Most notably, the commune planted more than 9,000 mu of fodder last year, harvesting a total of 840,000 jin of various grains and fodder, and more than 180,000 jin of fodder radishes, thus eliminating the phenomenon of relying entirely on the state for the supply of grain and livestock feed. This year, the fodder planting area has been expanded to more than 17,000 mu, and oil crops and vegetables have been added. Herdsmen have also universally raised pigs. According to preliminary calculations by the commune, the total income from animal husbandry and sideline occupations this year can reach more than 310,000 yuan. This year, the income of commune members has increased significantly. Compared with the pastoral cooperatives last year, the output value per labor day will increase by 80%, eliminating the phenomenon of persistent deficits. The number of households with deposits in the credit cooperative has increased from 384 at the end of last year to 447.
    After communization, the socialist consciousness of the herders has been greatly enhanced, and their enthusiasm has generally increased. The entire commune has 884 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers, but more than 1,000 people are actually participating in labor. At present, encouraged by the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of commune members have launched a new upsurge in production. Livestock fattening has generally reached about 80%, and work such as livestock mating, improvement, grass cutting, grass storage, shed building, and animal disease prevention are all underway.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Chaka People's Commune in Ulan County, Qinghai Province, is thriving in both population and livestock, with abundant food and clothing. In the year since the commune was established, the number of livestock has increased from more than 40,000 to more than 50,000, an actual increase of 21%. The more than 2,300 mu of grain and fodder crops sown this year promise a bumper harvest. The development of agriculture and animal husbandry has greatly increased the income of commune members. According to the distribution results, more than 92% of the 141 households in the original eight pastoral cooperatives under the commune increased their income. The commune members with the highest income increased their income by more than six times compared to the 1957 cooperative, and the average increase was also three to four times. As of the end of July, the commune's income had already exceeded the total income for the entire year last year.
    Communization has created conditions for large-scale animal husbandry infrastructure construction. Since last winter, the commune has built and repaired 36 livestock pens, 37 lamb sheds, and harvested more than 1 million jin of grass and planted fodder, ensuring the safe passage of livestock through the winter and spring. The Chaka area has vast grasslands, but in the past, the pasture was sparse and low. Since last winter and this spring, the commune has repaired 72 irrigation canals and dug 64 springs, irrigating more than 340,000 mu of grassland, making the aquatic plants very lush.
    The nomadic life of herders, who have lived by moving with the water and grass for thousands of years, ended after communization. The commune built more than 120 houses in settlements, and 70% of the commune members moved into new houses, and all school-age children were enrolled in schools. After settling down, it was also possible for the herders to farm. Last year, more than 1,600 mu of grain and fodder were sown, achieving self-sufficiency in grain for the first time. The crops are growing even more vigorously this year, and the commune is striving to sell 70,000 jin of grain to the state in addition to self-sufficiency. The commune, while ensuring livestock production, also rationally allocates labor according to the seasonality of agriculture and sideline production, giving priority to urgent tasks, focusing on animal husbandry during busy seasons and mobilizing troops for agriculture during busy seasons. The combination of animal husbandry and agriculture promotes each other, making production thrive. Last year, agriculture supported animal husbandry with more than 3 million jin of feed and fodder, supplementing more than 20,000 old and weak livestock; animal husbandry supplied agriculture with more than 20 million jin of fertilizer, fertilizing more than 800 mu of land, and supplying agriculture with more than 500 head of draft animals.
    The commune also established a meteorological team to guide grazing based on weather changes, and has summarized a set of grazing experiences for all seasons. Therefore, this year's summer fattening has been better than in any previous year. As of now, the first-class fattening rate has reached 90%. (Attached picture)

    牧区公社发展多种经营
    内蒙古白音布拉格公社牲畜兴旺副业发展粮食饲料自给
    青海茶卡公社大搞基本建设，实行定居，农牧业飞跃发展
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区杭锦旗白音布拉格（蒙语：富饶的泉水）人民公社建立以来，充分显示了巨大的优越性。畜牧业生产获得空前大丰收，多种经营蓬勃发展，牧民生活普遍提高。
    白音布拉格人民公社是由四百四十户蒙汉族社员组成的。公社刚一建立，就担负起与风雪寒冻斗争，保护牲畜安全过冬过春的严重任务。由于公社统一经营生产，合理安排了劳动力，牲畜分群饲养，大搞评比竞赛，使四万五千七百多头大牲畜和二万四千四百多头幼畜安全度过了冬春。牲畜的繁殖成活率大大提高，创造了1959年度牲畜总增殖率达到52％的奇迹。现在牲畜头数平均每户已由去年的一百零三头，增殖到一百五十头。
    建立了公社，劳动潜力得到更充分发挥。除搞好畜牧业生产外，还开展了多种经营。先后抽出人跑运输、掏石膏、编柳笆、挖甘草，大干了三个月，总共收入达六万九千多元。就这一项每户平均即收入一百五十多元。最突出的是去年这个社种了九千多亩饲料，共收获各种粮食和饲料八十四万斤，饲料萝卜十八万多斤，从此，摆脱了全靠国家供应粮食和牲畜饲料的现象。今年又把饲料种植面积扩大到一万七千多亩，并增加了油料和蔬菜。牧民们还普遍养了猪。据公社初步计算，全公社今年的牧、副业总收入可达三十一万多元。今年，社员收入显著增加，与去年牧业合作社相比，每个劳动日的产值将提高80％，消灭了长支短欠的现象。在信用社存款的户已由去年底的三百八十四户增加到四百四十七户。
    公社化以后，牧民的社会主义觉悟大大提高，干劲普遍高涨。全公社有整半劳力八百八十四个，而实际参加劳动的有一千人以上。目前，广大社员在党的八届八中全会公报鼓舞下，又掀起了新的生产高潮。牲畜抓膘已经普遍达到八成左右，牲畜配种、改良、打草、贮草、修棚搭圈、畜病防治等工作都在紧张的进行。
    据新华社讯　青海乌兰县茶卡人民公社人畜两旺，丰衣足食。公社建立一年来，牲畜由四万多头发展到五万多头，实增21％。今年播种的两千三百多亩粮食、饲料作物，丰收在望。农牧业的发展，大大增加了社员的收入。分配结果，公社所属原八个牧业社的一百四十一户，增加收入的户占总户数92％以上。收入最多的社员比1957年合作社时增加六倍多，一般的也达到三四倍。截止7月底，公社收入已经超过去年全年的总收入。
    公社化为大搞牧业基本建设创造了条件。去冬以来，全社共新打和补修畜圈三十六个，羊羔棚三十七个，打的草和种植的饲草共收一百多万斤，保证了牲畜安全越过冬春。茶卡地区草原辽阔，但过去牧草稀疏低矮。去冬今春以来，公社整修了水渠七十二条，挖泉六十四个，灌溉了草原三十四万多亩，水草变得非常丰茂。
    牧民群众千百年来逐水草而居的游牧生活，在公社化以后结束了。公社在定居点上修建了一百二十多间房子，70％的社员搬进了新房，适龄儿童全部入了学。定居后，牧民们也有可能种地了。去年播种粮食、饲料一千六百多亩，破天荒地实现了粮食自给。今年庄稼长得更加旺盛，公社争取在自给外，还要卖给国家粮食七万斤。公社在保证牧业生产的情况下，还根据农业、副业生产的季节性，分别轻重缓急，合理调配劳动力，牧忙就全力畜牧，农忙就调兵遣将务农。牧农结合，相互促进，使生产蒸蒸日上。去年农业支援畜牧业饲料、饲草三百多万斤，补饲了两万多只老弱牲畜；牧业供应农业肥料两千多万斤，在八百多亩土地上施了肥，并且供应农业五百多头耕畜。
    公社还成立有气象组，根据天气变化来指导放牧，并且总结出了一套四季放牧经验。因此今年夏膘抓得比过去任何一年都好。截止目前，一等膘达到90％。（附图片）
