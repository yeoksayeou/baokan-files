Instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council
    Concerning the Organization of Rural Market Trade
    September 23, 1959

    With the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the increase in social purchasing power, the demand for daily necessities by urban and rural people is increasing day by day. In order to meet the requirements of production development and improved living standards, in addition to vigorously organizing procurement and supply, and convening various levels of material exchange meetings, commercial departments must also actively organize and guide rural market trade, facilitate the exchange and adjustment of commodities by members of the people's communes, connect the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, promote the development of diversified economies of the people's communes, and invigorate the rural economy.

    The principle of leading and organizing rural market trade should be to be lively without being chaotic, and managed without being rigid. In order to correctly implement this principle, it is necessary to carry out propaganda work on economic policies among cadres and the masses, so that grassroots cadres understand that rural market trade is a component part of the socialist unified market. Developing rural market trade is conducive to promoting the development of agricultural, sideline, and handicraft production; facilitating the organization of short-distance transportation; facilitating the management of market prices; facilitating the exchange and adjustment of commodities between people's communes, production teams, and members; and also facilitating the opening up of sources of goods for commercial departments. People's communes and production teams should give necessary support to rural market trade, and educate members on relevant economic policies, so that they can achieve fair trading, no price gouging, no rush buying, no speculation, and no abandonment of agriculture for commerce in participating in market trade.

    At the beginning of developing rural market trade, in order to accumulate experience and avoid confusion, regulations should be made on the scope of commodities and prices in market trade, so as to facilitate steady progress and sound development.

    The following are the main issues related to the organization of rural market trade:

    I. Scope of Commodities Participating in Market Trade

    First-category materials (materials purchased and supplied under state plan) and second-category materials (materials purchased by the state in a unified manner): People's communes and production teams should first ensure the completion of the state-stipulated sales tasks; after completing the state-stipulated sales tasks, the remaining portion can be traded in rural markets. If the state needs it, it should be sold to state-owned commercial departments as a priority. The specific varieties, timing, and markets for trading can be determined by the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. For third-category materials (other materials other than the first and second categories), if the state stipulates sales tasks, or the people's communes, production teams, and members have signed contracts with the state, the people's communes, production teams, and members must ensure the completion of the stipulated sales tasks; after completing the stipulated sales tasks, the remaining portion can be traded in rural markets. For sporadic varieties for which no contracts have been signed with the state, the people's communes and production teams can sell them in the market.

    Sideline products and handicrafts produced by members' families and individuals in people's communes, whether they belong to the first, second, or third category of materials, can be sold in the market. However, for certain varieties of the first and second categories of materials, such as live pigs, the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government can stipulate certain sales tasks for members of the people's communes based on market conditions and national needs, and the members of the people's communes should ensure the completion of the state-stipulated sales tasks.

    II. Price Issues in Market Places

    The transaction price of the market should be managed and controlled based on the principle of centralized leadership and decentralized management, adhering to the spirit of facilitating the development of diversified economies and stabilizing market prices. The price of different commodities should be managed and controlled in accordance with the following regulations:

    (1) When people's communes, production teams, and members sell first- and second-category materials, they must uniformly implement the state's purchase price.

    (2) When people's communes, production teams, and members sell third-category materials in the market, they must comply with the management of market prices. The state's management of market prices for third-category materials should adopt different policies according to the variety. For major commodities in the third category, transactions should generally be conducted according to the state-stipulated price; for some varieties, the competent authorities can set maximum and minimum price limits according to the price management authority. For those scattered and small commodities, the trading parties can fairly negotiate prices under the guidance of the market management committee.

    Market price is a concrete manifestation of the distribution relationship between the collective ownership economy and the ownership by the whole people economy, which is related to national construction and people's livelihood. Therefore, market prices must remain stable. Before the realization of people's communes in rural areas across the country, the price of third-category materials was generally reasonable, and should not be easily changed without sufficient grounds. If the market price of some varieties of third-category materials exceeds a reasonable level due to temporary excess demand, it must be managed, rush purchases must be stopped, negotiated pricing must be implemented, and sources of goods must be allocated. For commodities that are oversupplied in the short term, if the price is too low to affect production, the competent commercial departments can purchase them at an appropriate price.

    III. Forms of Rural Market Trade Markets

    The forms of rural market trade markets should be based on the principles of being conducive to production, meeting the purchasing and selling requirements of members, and saving members' time; and should adopt diverse forms according to local conditions based on the changes in rural economic life after communization. Regular fairs should be scheduled in conjunction with members' public holidays, festivals, and historical customs. Irregular small-scale material exchange meetings and temple fairs, as well as permanent exchanges, warehouses, and farmers' service departments, can also continue to be adopted.

    IV. Participants in Market Trade

    The main participants in market trade are communes, production teams, members, and local state-owned commercial departments. Communes, production teams, and members are not allowed to engage in commodity speculation or open shops.

    The raw materials and products needed by production enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives (groups) affiliated to the commune, which belong to the first and second categories of commodities, shall be uniformly supplied and purchased by the commercial departments designated by the state, and shall not be purchased or sold by themselves in the market. When they are allowed to directly purchase certain raw materials and sell certain products in the market with the consent of the market management department, they must purchase and sell at the prices stipulated by the state.

    Purchasing personnel from factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, groups, and military units from other places must hold letters of introduction from the local industrial and commercial administrative department above the county level and be approved by the local market management agency before they can enter the market for trading. The above-mentioned purchasing personnel from local and neighboring areas can participate in market trade with the consent of the market management agency with letters of introduction from their own units. All the above-mentioned purchasing personnel must obey the local market management.

    Small vendors organized by state-owned commercial organizations can travel to fairs and villages to engage in speculation within the approved business scope, and obtain reasonable income through regional price differences. However, they are not allowed to engage in long-distance speculation, nor are they allowed to make resales for speculative profits in the same market, and must strictly abide by market management.

    V. Strengthening the Leadership and Management of Rural Market Trade Markets

    In order to strengthen the leadership and management of market places, the material exchange meetings of people's communes should be combined with market trade in transactions. In terms of organization, county and town market management committees should be established under the leadership of the county party committee, town party committee, and commune party committee. Areas that already have market management committees should strengthen their leadership. Areas that have not established market management committees should establish them. The market management committee should be composed of relevant departments such as commerce, grain, banking, taxation, industry, and agriculture. The market management committee should have dedicated personnel responsible for daily work in order to better organize market trade.

    The tasks of the market management committee are: to implement state policies and market management methods; to supervise the implementation of price policies; to ensure legitimate trade and guide market transactions; to organize various forms of material exchange meetings; to lead exchanges and service departments; to ban all illegal activities in the market; and to handle and resolve some problems occurring in the market.

    中共中央  国务院
    关于组织农村集市贸易的指示
    一九五九年九月二十三日
    随着工农业生产的不断跃进和社会购买力的提高，城乡人民对日用生活品的需求日益增长。为适应生产发展和生活提高的要求，商业部门除了大力组织收购、供应，召开各级物资交流会以外，还必须积极组织和指导农村集市贸易，便利人民公社社员交换和调剂商品，沟通城乡物资交流，促进人民公社多种经济的发展，活跃农村经济。
    领导和组织农村集市贸易的原则，应当是活而不乱、管而不死。为了正确贯彻执行这一原则，必须在干部和群众中进行经济政策的宣传工作，让基层干部懂得农村集市贸易是社会主义统一市场的一个组成部分。开展农村集市贸易，有利于促进农、副业、手工业生产的发展，便于组织短途运输，便于管理市场价格；便于人民公社、生产队、社员之间进行商品的交换和调剂；同时也便于为商业部门开辟货源。人民公社、生产队对农村集市贸易要给以必要的支持，并向社员进行有关经济政策的教育，使他们在参加集市贸易当中，作到买卖公平、不抬价、不抢购、不贩运、不弃农经商。
    在开展农村集市贸易之初，为了积累经验，避免发生混乱，应该对集市贸易的商品范围、价格等方面作出规定，以利于稳步前进，健全发展。
    现将有关组织农村集市贸易的几个主要问题，作如下规定：
    一、参加集市贸易的商品范围
    第一类物资（国家计划收购和计划供应的物资）和第二类物资
  （国家统一收购的物资），人民公社、生产队应该首先保证完成国家规定的交售任务；在完成国家规定的交售任务以后，剩余的部分，可以到农村集市进行交易，如果国家需要，应该尽先卖给国营商业部门。至于哪些品种、在什么时间、在哪些集市交易等，可以由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会自行规定。第三类物资（一、二两类以外的其他物资），凡是国家规定有交售任务，或者人民公社、生产队、社员同国家签订有合同的，人民公社、生产队、社员一定要保证完成规定的交售任务；在完成规定的交售任务以后，剩余的部分，可以到农村集市进行交易；凡是没有同国家签订合同的零星品种，人民公社、生产队可以在集市出售。
    人民公社社员家庭和个人生产的副业产品、手工业品，不论属于第一类、第二类或者第三类物资，都可以在集市出售。但是，第一、第二类物资中的某些品种如生猪等，各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会可以根据市场情况和国家的需要，规定人民公社社员一定的交售任务，人民公社社员应该保证完成国家规定的交售任务。
    二、集市市场内的价格问题
    集市的交易价格，应该本着有利于多种经济的发展和稳定市场物价的精神，根据集中领导、分级管理的原则，加强管理。对于不同商品的价格，应该按照以下的规定管理和掌握：
    （一）人民公社、生产队、社员出售第一、第二类物资的时候，必须一律执行国家的收购牌价。
    （二）人民公社、生产队、社员在市场上出售第三类物资的时候，必须服从市场物价的管理。国家对于第三类物资市场价格的管理，应该分别品种采取不同的方针。第三类物资中的主要商品，一般地应该按照国家规定的牌价进行交易；有些品种也可以根据物价管理权限，由主管部门规定最高和最低的限价。对于那些零星细小的商品，可以在市场管理委员会的指导下，由交易双方公平议价。
    市场价格是集体所有制经济与全民所有制经济之间分配关系的具体表现之一，关系着国家建设和人民生活。因此，市场物价必须保持稳定。在全国农村实现人民公社化以前，第三类物资的价格一般是合理的，如果没有充分的根据，不宜轻易变动。如果第三类物资中有的品种由于一时求过于供，市价超过了合理程度的时候，必须加以管理，制止抢购，实行议价，分配货源。对于在短期内供过于求的商品，如果价格过低，以致影响生产的时候，可以由主管商业部门以适当的价格收购起来。
    三、农村集市贸易市场的形式
    农村集市贸易市场的形式，应该以有利于生产，满足社员购销要求、节省社员时间为原则；并且应该根据公社化以后农村经济生活的变化情况，因地制宜地采取多种多样的形式。定期集市，应该结合社员的公休、节日和历史习惯来规定。不定期的小型物资交流会和庙会，以及经常性的交易所、货栈、农民服务部等形式，也都可以继续采取。
    四、参加集市贸易的对象
    参加集市贸易的，主要是公社、生产队和社员，以及当地的国营商业部门。公社、生产队和社员，都不得进行商品贩运和开设店铺。
    公社所属的生产企业和手工业生产合作社（组）所需要的原料、材料和生产的产品，属于第一、第二类商品的，由国家指定的商业部门统一供应和收购，不得在市场上自行采购或销售。经过市场管理部门同意，允许他们在市场上直接进行收购某些原料、材料和销售某些产品的时候，必须按照国家规定的牌价收购和销售。
    外地的厂矿、企业、机关、团体、部队等采购人员，须持有原地县以上工商行政主管部门的介绍信件，并经当地市场管理机构的批准，才能进入市场交易。本地和邻近地区的上述采购人员，可以持本单位的介绍信经过市场管理机构的同意参加集市贸易。以上各种采购人员，都必须服从当地的市场管理。
    经过国营商业组织起来的小商贩，按照批准的经营范围，可以赶集串乡，进行贩运，通过地区差价取得合理的收入。但是不准远途贩运，也不准在同一集市作转手买卖，投机取利，并且要严格遵守市场管理。
    五、加强农村集市贸易市场的领导与管理
    为了加强集市市场的领导和管理，在交易上，应该把人民公社的物资交流会，同市场贸易结合起来进行。在组织上，应该在县委镇委公社党委领导下，设立县、集镇市场管理委员会。已经设有市场管理委员会的地区，应该加强领导。没有建立市场管理委员会的地区，应该建立。市场管理委员会由商业、粮食、银行、税务、工业、农业等有关部门组成。市场管理委员会应该有专人负责日常工作，以便更好地组织集市贸易。
    市场管理委员会的任务是：贯彻执行国家政策和市场管理办法；监督价格政策的执行；保障合法贸易，指导市场交易；组织各种形式的物资交流会；领导交易所和服务部；取缔市场上一切违法活动；处理和解决市场上发生的一些问题。
