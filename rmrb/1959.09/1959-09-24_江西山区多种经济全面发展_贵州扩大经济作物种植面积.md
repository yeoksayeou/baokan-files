    Jiangxi Mountain Areas Achieve Overall Development of Diversified Economy
    Guizhou Expands Planting Area of Economic Crops

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang. Guizhou's mountainous areas, relying on the superior conditions of communization this year, while vigorously developing grain production, have expanded the planting area of economic crops such as flue-cured tobacco, cotton, sugarcane, sugar beets, and hemp, adapting to local conditions. At present, the growth and fruiting of various economic crops are generally good, and a bumper harvest is expected.

    Guizhou Province has a mild climate and abundant rainfall, making it very suitable for the growth of economic crops. After liberation, under the attention and leadership of the Party, the planting area of economic crops has expanded year after year, and yields have continuously increased. However, before communization, due to the small size of agricultural cooperatives and the inability to rationally use land, the development of economic crops was not rapid enough. This year, thanks to the People's Communes, which have formulated plans for the comprehensive development of production, the situation has undergone tremendous changes. Each commune, based on the principle of planting whatever crops are suitable for the land, has expanded the sown area of economic crops. Zhijin County in the western mountainous area is suitable for planting flue-cured tobacco, but until last year, the planting area was only 8,000 mu; this year, relying on the superiority of the communes, it has suddenly developed to 28,000 mu. Renhuai County has a relatively hot climate and has always had a habit of growing cotton. This year, the People's Commune enabled cotton production to further develop. The county's planting area expanded from more than 20,000 mu last year to more than 40,000 mu, becoming the county with the largest cotton planting area in the province.

    During the busy season of sowing and transplanting economic crops, the People's Communes demonstrated tremendous superiority. In mid-March, the Chengguan, Mashan, and Leyuan communes in Wangmo County, in order to seize the season and rush to plant sugarcane, organized more than 13,000 people to carry out a shock campaign. When transplanting flue-cured tobacco, Guiding County transferred 30% of the labor force to rush the transplanting, greatly speeding up the progress. Many communes and production teams with more economic crops have established specialized teams, equipped with experienced cadres and veteran farmers, and have made field management very meticulous.

    江西山区多种经济全面发展
    贵州扩大经济作物种植面积
    据新华社贵阳讯　贵州山区今年依靠公社化的优越条件，在大力发展粮食生产的同时，因地制宜地扩大了烤烟、棉花、甘蔗、甜菜、麻类等经济作物的种植面积。目前各种经济作物生长和结实情况一般良好，可望丰收。
    贵州省气候温和，雨量充沛，很适合经济作物的生长。解放后，在党的重视和领导下，经济作物种植面积连年都有扩大，产量不断提高。但是，在公社化以前，由于农业社规模小，不能合理使用土地，经济作物的发展还不够迅速。今年，由于人民公社，制定了全面发展生产的规划，情况发生了巨大变化。各公社都根据适合种植什么作物的土地就种什么作物的原则，扩大了经济作物播种面积。西部山区织金县适宜种植烤烟，但一直到去年，播种面积还只有八千亩；今年依靠公社的优越性，一下子就发展到二万八千亩。仁怀县气候较热，历来有种棉习惯，今年人民公社才使棉花生产获得了进一步发展，全县播种面积由去年的二万多亩扩大到四万多亩，一跃而为全省种棉最多的县份。
    在经济作物播种和移栽的紧张季节里，人民公社显示了巨大优越性。望谟县城关、麻山、乐园等三个公社，3月中旬为了抓住季节，抢种甘蔗，组织了一万三千多人进行突击。贵定县在移栽烤烟时，抽调了30％的劳力突击抢栽，大大地加快了移栽进度。许多经济作物较多的公社和生产队，都成立了专业队，配备了有经验的干部和老农，把田间管理搞得很细致。
