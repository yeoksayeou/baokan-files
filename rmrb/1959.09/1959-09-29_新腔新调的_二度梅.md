A New Tune for the "Twice Blooming Plum"
　　Hu Sha

　　After watching the Han Opera "Twice Blooming Plum," performed by the Wuhan Han Opera Troupe as part of the National Day celebration, I felt a refreshing sense of novelty.

　　"Twice Blooming Plum" is a familiar patriotic story. To expedite the unfolding of the dramatic conflict, the Han Opera begins with Mei Liangyu concealing his identity and working as a servant in the Chen family, continuing until Chen Xingyuan's family hires him as a "happy servant." The opera opens with the "happy servant" sweeping the plum garden, followed by Chen Xingyuan and her father visiting the plum garden to appreciate the plum blossoms, which evokes memories of old friends. A gust of wind causes the plum blossoms to wither. Chen's father and daughter, along with Mei Liangyu, are deeply saddened. In this shared sorrow, the father-in-law and son-in-law, as well as the betrothed couple, recognize each other, and the plum blossoms bloom again. Immediately following is the court forcing Chen Xingyuan to marry a foreign chieftain for peace. The story progresses through "Scolding the Prime Minister," "Chongtai Tower," and finally "Zhaojun Temple," where Chen Xingyuan leaps off a cliff and ascends to immortality. The plot development is very tight and natural.

　　The opera has a small cast, so each actor's singing and acting are crucial. Comrades Chen Bohua, Hu Guilin, Wang Xiaolou, and Li Luoke work together meticulously, creating an atmosphere of heroic tragedy in the opera. The play does not use realistic sets; instead, a plum blossom is embroidered on the backdrop of a gauze curtain. The overall performance style feels clean, solemn, and beautiful.

　　Chen Bohua's portrayal of Chen Xingyuan is successful in terms of both character development and singing and acting skills, fully demonstrating the actor's artistic creativity. Chen Bohua has always been an excellent singing actress, adept at using delicate vocal melodies to depict the emotions of the characters. Her voice remains round and full, enduring, and with plenty of reserve power. What is especially commendable is that in this opera, she combines the needs of the character and creates many novel and moving melodies based on the original Han Opera tunes, giving people a sense of freshness and charm.

　　Especially in the "Chongtai Tower" scene, in order to depict Chen Xingyuan's feelings of parting with Mei Liangyu and her longing for her homeland, Chen Bohua developed the "Three-beat" melody into "Nine-beat", greatly enriching and changing the Han Opera melody. In the final scene, to depict Chen Xingyuan's grief and indignation, she incorporated the "Bozi" vocal style into the "Fan Erhuang" tune. It is evident that Chen Bohua has carefully designed the entire opera's melodies to more delicately depict the changes in Chen Xingyuan's thoughts and feelings. This gives the character of Chen Xingyuan a unique musical image.

　　Han Opera is an ancient opera genre with rich vocal melodies. Precisely because it is ancient, its melodies are not unfamiliar to us. I am wondering, why does Chen Bohua's new tune make me and my friends feel that the Han Opera's female lead's melodies have gained new life, giving us a sense of freshness and beauty?

　　The great Qing Dynasty playwright Li Yu has a famous saying about vocal melodies: "Changing the tune means changing the ancient tune into a new tune. This is very difficult and cannot be done by just anyone. …Change brings newness, no change brings decay. Change brings life, no change brings rigidity." I believe in Li Yu's words. Precisely because Li Yu was an artist with practical experience, he knew that this was a "difficult task" and could easily be criticized and stumble. Who criticizes? The audience. It was not until the modern Peking Opera performing artist Cheng Yanqiu that the dialectical relationship of the evolution of vocal melodies was correctly stated. He was the founder of the Cheng school of Peking Opera, and he recognized from practice that "If the tune is too familiar, the audience will feel it is not fresh; if the tune is too unfamiliar, the audience will not recognize you. It should both let the audience recognize that you are singing Peking Opera and make them feel fresh, gradually evolving." I believe that what Li Yu called "difficult" is probably because he had not yet recognized this problem.

　　I think Comrade Chen Bohua's new tune is following the path of Mr. Cheng Yanqiu.

　　I believe that this is an achievement created by the Han Opera artists under the encouragement of the Party's call to go all out and liberate their thinking. I feel that the ancient opera genre of Han Opera has become younger, and it has and will emit even greater brilliance.

　　To take Comrade Chen Bohua herself as an example, she left the stage for fifteen years before liberation. After liberation, she resumed her stage artistic life and is full of creativity in her art, and is loved by the vast audience. I believe that through the continuous efforts of Han Opera colleagues, Han Opera will surely emit even more dazzling brilliance.

    新腔新调的“二度梅”
    胡沙
    看了武汉市汉剧团参加国庆献礼演出的汉剧“二度梅”，感觉得耳目为之一新。
    “二度梅”是我们熟知的一出爱国主义的故事，汉剧为了使戏剧矛盾展开的迅速，从梅良玉隐姓埋名到陈杏元家当喜童写起，一开始就 是喜童打扫梅园，陈杏元父女到梅园赏梅，触景生情，想起了故友。一阵狂风，梅花雕谢。陈氏父女和梅良玉十分悲伤，在这共同的悲伤中翁婿和未婚夫妻相认了，梅花又重开了。紧接着就是朝廷逼迫陈杏元去和番，经过“骂相”、“重台”直到“昭君庙”陈杏元跳崖成仙飘飘而去。剧情发展十分紧凑自然。
    这出戏的演员不多，因此每人的唱做都很重。陈伯华、胡桂林、王晓楼、李罗克等同志配合的严谨，创造出了这出戏的慷慨悲歌的气氛。这出戏没有用写实的布景，只在后边的纱帐上绣了一支梅花。整个演出风格使人感到干净，庄严，美观。
    陈伯华同志扮演的陈杏元，从人物性格的刻划和唱做技巧方面都很成功，充分的显示了演员的艺术创造的才华。陈伯华原来就是一位优秀唱工演员，她很善于通过细腻的唱腔来描绘剧中人物的情感。而她唱来嗓音仍然圆润如故，持久，并有余力。尤其可贵的是她在这出戏中，结合人物的需要，在原来汉剧腔调的基础上创造了许多新颖动听的腔调，给人以清新动人之感。
    特别在“重台”那场，陈伯华为了描绘陈杏元和梅良玉的别离之情及对故乡的思念，将三眼唱腔发展成九眼，对汉剧唱腔作了极大的丰富和变化。又如在最后一场，为了描绘陈杏元的悲愤之情，在“反二簧”中揉进了“拨子”声腔。听得出来，陈伯华为了更细致地描绘陈杏元思想情感的变化，对全剧唱腔作了精心的设计。这样就使陈杏元这个人物，具有了独特的音乐形象。
    汉剧是个古老的剧种，声腔很丰富。正因为她古老，所以我们对她的声腔并不生疏。我在想，为什么陈伯华的新腔使我和我的朋友们感到汉剧的旦角的腔调具有了新的生命，给我们以新鲜感和优美感？
    清代大戏剧家李渔有一段论声腔的名言：“变调者，变古调为新调也。此事甚难，非其人不行。……变则新，不变则腐。变则活，不变则板。”我是信服李渔的这些话的。正因为李渔是个有实践经验的艺术家，他知道这是件“难事”，弄不好会受非难，栽跟头。谁非难呢？观众。直到近代的京剧表演艺术家程砚秋，才正确的道出了声腔演变的辩证关系。他是京剧一大流派程腔的创始者，他从实践中认识了“腔太熟，观众觉得不新鲜，腔太生，观众又不认识你了，应当既叫观众认识你唱的是京剧，又要使他感到新鲜，逐步的衍变。”我体会李笠翁所说的“难”，恐怕就是对这个问题还没有认识。
  陈伯华同志的新腔，我看是按着程砚秋先生的路子走的。
    我认为这是汉剧艺术家们在党的鼓足干劲，解放思想的鼓舞下创造出来的成就。我感觉到汉剧这个古老的剧种变得年轻了，她已经和还要发出更大的光辉。
    再以陈伯华同志本人来说，她解放前脱离舞台十五年之久，解放后，才恢复舞台艺术生活，而且在艺术上朝气蓬勃充满了创造性，受到广大观众的喜爱。我相信，经过汉剧同行们不断的努力，一定使汉剧放出更夺目的光彩。
