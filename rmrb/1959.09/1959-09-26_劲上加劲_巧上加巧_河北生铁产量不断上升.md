Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 24th: On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, workers on the iron smelting front in Hebei Province are triumphantly singing as pig iron production continues to rise. The average daily output in the first ten days of September increased by 39.84% compared to August, the average daily output in the middle ten days of September increased by 17.39% compared to the first ten days, and the average daily output from the 21st to the 22nd increased by 7.03% compared to the middle ten days. The qualification rate of pig iron reached over 82%, and the coke consumption per ton of iron smelted also decreased significantly, achieving an all-round bumper harvest.

Since the beginning of September, inspired by the slogan "Higher production, still higher production, vow to win a complete victory in September, and offer a generous gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China," workers in iron smelting plants across Hebei have launched a vigorous "high output, high quality, low cost" competition. Many new records have emerged in numerous iron smelting plants, and output has gradually increased. The workers of each blast furnace at the Handan Iron and Steel Plant have had their production enthusiasm rise wave upon wave. They have promoted the spirit of communist cooperation and strived to improve operations, increasing daily output from about 400 tons in August to over 600 tons, with a maximum daily output reaching over 790 tons. The workers of Linshui Iron Smelting Plant, which won the Red Banner of Excellence, have been adding strength to strength and ingenuity upon ingenuity, exceeding the high-yield plan every day. The pig iron qualification rate has reached 100%, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces has averaged 1.44, and the coke required to smelt one ton of pig iron has been reduced to 0.87 tons.

Leading cadres such as factory directors and Party committee secretaries of many iron smelting plants have gone deep into workshops and furnace fronts, "participating in production, inspecting production, and directing production," promptly resolving key issues in production. The factory director and Party committee secretary of the iron smelting factory of the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Plant went deep to the furnace front, specifically organized workers to learn advanced experiences, established and improved operating procedures, and changed the backward situation. The average daily output from September 7th to 13th increased by 50% compared to August, and the pig iron qualification rate reached 97.3%. The factory director of the Shacheng Iron Smelting Plant in Zhangjiakou City personally led the electrical workers to overhaul all the blast furnace equipment in the plant piece by piece in two days, ensuring that output rose steadily.

    劲上加劲　巧上加巧
    河北生铁产量不断上升
    新华社天津24日电　河北省各地炼铁战线上的职工，在建国十周年前夕高奏凯歌，使生铁产量不断上升。9月份上旬的平均日产量比8月份提高39.84％，中旬的平均日产量比上旬提高17.39％，21日到22日平均日产量又比中旬提高7.03％。生铁的合格率达到82％以上，每炼一吨铁所消耗的焦炭也显著下降，获得了全面大丰收。
    进入9月份以来，河北各地炼铁厂的职工在“高产再高产，誓夺9月满堂红，向建国十周年献厚礼”口号鼓舞下，如火如荼地开展了“高产、优质、低成本”的竞赛运动。许多炼铁厂新纪录不断涌现，产量逐步升高。邯郸钢铁厂的各个高炉职工，生产热情一浪高过一浪，他们发扬共产主义协作精神，并且努力改进操作，使日产由8月份的四百吨左右提高到六百多吨，最高日产量达到了七百九十多吨。获得优胜红旗的临水炼铁厂的职工，更是劲上加劲，巧上加巧，每天都超额完成高产计划，生铁合格率达到百分之百，小高炉利用系数平均达到一点四四，每炼一吨生铁所需要的焦炭降低到零点八七吨。
    各地许多炼铁厂的厂长、党委书记等领导干部，都深入车间、炉前，“边参加生产、边检查生产、边指挥生产”，及时解决了生产中的关键问题。石家庄动力机械厂炼铁工厂的厂长和党委书记深入到炉前，具体组织工人学习先进经验，建立和健全了操作规程，一改落后局面，9月7日到13日平均日产量比8月份提高50％，生铁合格率达到97.3％。张家口市沙城炼铁厂的厂长亲自带领电机工人，用两天的时间就对全厂高炉设备按件检修完毕，保证了产量节节上升。
