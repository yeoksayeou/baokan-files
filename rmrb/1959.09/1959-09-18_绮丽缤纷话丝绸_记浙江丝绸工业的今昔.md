    A Colorful Tale of Silk
    ——Remembering the Past and Present of Zhejiang's Silk Industry
    By our reporters Li Xinmin and Su Lieshan
    Do you love the colorful clouds in the sky, and the fragrant, vibrant blossoms?
    When you step into any silk weaving factory in Zhejiang Province and face the dazzling, exquisitely beautiful silks on the looms, you will immediately feel that the colorful clouds pale in comparison, and the blossoms lose their luster. It's as if you are standing before many moving paintings, drawn into various different realms by the artist's brush.
    Zhejiang silk comes in an extremely wide variety of types and colors. In the ten years since liberation, the province's thirty-plus silk factories have produced enough silk to encircle the Earth's equator six times. These silks can be divided into fifteen major categories: ling (damask), luo (gauze), chou (plain silk), duan (satin), sha (gauze), juan (taffeta), fang (spun silk), ge (grass cloth), jin (brocade), zhou (crepe), ni (wool-like silk), xiao (thin silk), ti (fine wool fabric), rong (velvet), and ge (plaid). Each major category has numerous subcategories, with constantly updated patterns. Here, there are brocades with clusters of flowers, light and translucent burnout georgette, gold and silver dragon satins shimmering with metallic light, and Dongfeng silk with flowers within flowers, and intricately arranged blooms. Here, mountains, rivers, people, clouds, flowers, and birds are so cleverly arranged; excellent patterns from China and abroad, ancient and modern, are so harmoniously utilized. Here, some are magnificent and opulent, some are antique and elegant, some are as light as autumn water, and some are as bright as spring sunlight.
    These silks have gained increasing popularity both domestically and abroad. When they were exhibited in fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic, they were praised as "as soft as water and as beautiful as poetry." These silks also caused a sensation in Paris and enticed the women of Lyon. At an international exposition held in Leipzig, Zhejiang silk was rated as a first-class silk fabric with a high degree of artistry. Currently, people in more than sixty countries are purchasing Zhejiang silk to make their favorite clothing and decorations.
    Zhejiang Province, known as the home of silk, has a long history of silk production. Many exquisite varieties appeared very early, and the colors and patterns have been continuously developing. Those who have visited Zhuji County in central Zhejiang Province, along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, must see the hometown of the ancient beauty Xi Shi, Luoluo Village. On the stone wall along the Puyang River at the edge of the village, one can clearly see the two carved characters "Huansha" (washing silk) written by the great calligrapher Wang Xizhi. "Sha" is a type of crystal-clear silk fabric. Later, when Fan Li presented Xi Shi to King Goujian of Yue, she wore "Luogu," which was a silk fabric with three-dimensional patterns. It can be seen that more than two thousand years ago, the craftsmanship of handmade silk fabrics in Zhejiang Province was already quite advanced.
    During the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, silk weaving production in the Zhejiang area was very developed. The Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi wrote a poem praising "Liao Ling" (patterned silk gauze), in which he said: "Last year, the imperial envoy proclaimed an imperial decree, taking patterns from the heavens to weave on Earth, weaving autumn geese flying beyond the clouds, dyeing it the color of spring water in the south of the Yangtze." The poet depicted the silk production of the time as such a beautiful picture: a line of autumn geese cut through the clouds and soared high, while the color of the sky was dyed like the spring water of the south of the Yangtze.
    However, in the decades before liberation, silk production in Zhejiang Province declined. The exploitation, plunder, and strangulation policies of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries suffocated thousands of weaving households and factories scattered throughout the region. Many looms were sold off, the wood of the looms was burned as firewood, and production plummeted. There was no question of developing new varieties or patterns; only a few old varieties were woven on the looms, appearing dull and colorless. This situation came to an end only with the liberation of Zhejiang Province in 1949.
    After the people gained power, with the care and support of the Party and the government, many machines that had been idle for a long time started running again, and production continued to rise. Subsequently, with the advancement of socialist transformation and the construction of modern silk printing and dyeing complexes, Zhejiang Province's silk industry experienced unprecedented prosperity. In the ten years since, not only has the production volume of silk fabrics far exceeded the highest levels in history, but the varieties and patterns of silk fabrics have also been changing with each passing day, with spring colors blooming everywhere. According to statistics, more than one thousand new varieties and more than four thousand new patterns have been designed in these ten years, the novelty and uniqueness of which are unmatched by any period in history.
    As everyone knows, silk fabrics are woven from warp and weft threads. Silk designers use the ever-changing brilliance emitted by the intersection of these colorful raw silk threads to cleverly design various new varieties. They then design many new patterns based on the characteristics of each new variety.
    Before liberation, Zhejiang Province did not have a single full-time person engaged in the design of varieties and patterns. After liberation, many veteran artisans with rich experience in silk production were assigned to newly established designer positions. After the joint state-private ownership, many designers who were originally scattered in various private silk weaving factories were successively concentrated in the newly established Shengli Silk Weaving Sample Factory, gathering together and each displaying their special skills. In order to create more varieties and patterns, designers stepped out of their offices and came into contact with the vast reality of life in the motherland. The glittering blast furnaces, the endless waves of rice, the soft lights and graceful movements on the stage, every new product in the store window, everything that appeared on the streets, became their new subject matter. Many designers have created new silks that have been praised in this way. They made old products more diverse and beautiful; they made new products constantly appear, changing with each passing day.
    The new variety "Liwen Jin" recently created by Ma Zungen, a designer at the Shengli Silk Weaving Sample Factory, is one of the many new varieties that have received good reviews. This variety of silk has colored stripes woven on its surface, and brocade-like flowers between the stripes. It looks like watching blooming flowers in a spring park through railings, with distinct layers, moderate shades, and filled with endless poetic charm and vibrant vitality. How was this variety created? It turned out that there was a bamboo curtain on the window of Ma Zungen's office, and he saw it every day when he walked into the office. Last autumn, he became particularly interested in this curtain, often watching it carefully. The curtain swayed in the wind, making a slight sound, the sunlight on the curtain was sometimes strong and sometimes faint, and the scenery outside the curtain was sometimes visible and sometimes hidden. After watching it for several months, a pattern for a new variety matured in his mind.
    Ma Zungen, with his silvery hair, has lived in silk weaving factories for thirty-five years. For the first twenty-five years, he moved from Suzhou, Shanghai, Huzhou, and Hangzhou, changing more than a dozen silk weaving factories, experiencing unemployment, hunger, and being looked down upon, with his talent having no place to be used. After liberation, he changed his appearance, his work was stable, and his life improved day by day. The Party's emphasis on design work moved him deeply. At the Shengli Silk Weaving Sample Factory, he and other designers created many famous new varieties. One type called Hongni Juan (Rainbow Silk) looks like waves on the water under the light, emitting undulating light. This was created by him and designer Li Cishan through joint research. They referred to many related magazines and picture albums from China and abroad, analyzed several colors, and transformed them into one color, successfully designing this variety. Ma Zungen and designer Song Runpu cooperated to create Gold and Silver Dragon Satin, which was the beginning of the use of multiple fibers in the history of Zhejiang silk. The Dongfeng Silk, which is very popular in the international market, was also created by Ma Zungen. This silk has printing, jacquard, and openwork, fully demonstrating that Zhejiang Province's silk design has reached a very high level.
    Speaking of the varieties and patterns of Zhejiang silk, one cannot fail to mention "weaving brocade." These multi-colored silk portraits, silk landscape paintings, silk tablecloths, and silk cushion covers are known as the "exotic flowers and rare herbs" of silk. Appreciating the pictures on these silk fabrics is truly refreshing. Look, the White Pagoda of Beihai Park, the rock formations of the Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou, the sea of clouds and peaks of Mount Huangshan, the secluded bamboo path of Yunqi in Hangzhou, light boats on the West Lake under the moonlight, and the Qiantang River at the eighth month's high tide each scene has its own characteristics, giving people the feeling that not a single thread can be added or subtracted.
    The production of these silk fabrics is concentrated in the now famous Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory. This factory was founded in 1922. Before liberation, all products were woven by hand, with small widths and few colors. After the Anti-Japanese War, production became even more unstable, relying on foreign debt to maintain appearances. Once liberated, the factory developed step by step, the quality improved day by day, and sales expanded day by day. Worker Bian Renlian successfully used electric looms to weave brocade, not only increasing the output by seven times, but also leading this production into a new stage. The joint state-private ownership of the enterprise further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the vast number of workers. They continuously enriched the content of the brocade paintings, and also wove brocades that were taller, larger, and with more colors.
    Jin Zucan, a 29-year-old loom operator, is one of the many outstanding workers in this factory. He has been a silk weaver for eleven years, transforming from a farmer. Under the cultivation of the Party, he has skillfully mastered the technique of weaving tablecloths. This technique was originally quite complicated, but now he, like other workers, can operate two machines at the same time, and has even operated four at the most. These days, on his machine, he is weaving a tablecloth with the ancient painting "Hall of Buddhist Fragrance". Five shuttles carrying five colors of weft threads move back and forth on the machine. Weaving such a tablecloth requires the shuttle to move back and forth more than ten thousand times, without any mistakes. Moreover, the electric loom operates the shuttle very quickly, making it difficult to control. However, because he does a good job in preparation, and he watches very closely during work, any thread that goes wrong cannot escape his eyes, and he immediately corrects it with both hands. In this way, one can see that the surface of the silk gradually shows a picture of towering ancient trees and pavilions faintly appearing. After one tablecloth is woven, another begins.
    The ancient painting "Jinguyuan," woven from more than twenty colors, depicts various different characters expressing various different emotions in layers of towering ancient buildings. The picture is very moving. An old worker is sitting on a hand-drawn silk weaving machine, weaving this landscape painting, with a row of shuttles in front of him, using them calmly with both hands. His eyes are focused on the color of the weft thread on the shuttle. Here, sea green and lake blue, bright red and fire yellow, dark gray and light gray, are so similar that it is not easy to distinguish them. However, when he works, his hands and eyes are attentive, without a single mistake. These workers have developed a keen ability to distinguish colors.
    Among the silk images, many pictures reflect the scenes of socialist construction. The Yangtze River Bridge flies over the river, with a majestic posture; the night scene of the No. 1 blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, with lights and furnace fire reflecting each other, reveals the workers' soaring drive; the tall buildings of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant show the huge scale of construction, making people yearn for it. Many silk images also use the works of famous painters. The shrimp painted by Qi Baishi are so full of vitality; the steed painted by Xu Beihong is lifelike, as if about to leap out of the picture.
    A Polish engineer visited the Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory and left a message saying: "We are very happy to be able to see this factory where every worker is an artist." What a moving evaluation!

    绮丽缤纷话丝绸
    ——记浙江丝绸工业的今昔
    本报记者　李新民　苏烈山
    你是不是喜欢天空里绚烂多彩的云霞，你是不是喜欢鲜艳芬芳的百花？
    当你走进浙江省的任何一家织绸厂，面对着绸机上的光彩夺目、精美绝纶的绸缎，你立刻就会感到，彩霞为之失光，百花为之逊色，你好像站在许多幅动人的图画面前，被美术家的画面带入各种不同的境界。
    浙江丝绸的品种花色是极多的。解放十年来，全省三十多家丝绸工厂，生产了可以围绕地球赤道六转的绸缎。这些绸缎，可分为十五大类，就是：绫、罗、绸、缎、纱、绢、纺、葛、锦、绉、呢、绡、绨、绒、格。每大类又是名目众多，花样翻新。这里，有花团锦簇的织锦缎，有轻盈透亮的烂花乔其纱，有闪烁着金光银光的金银龙缎，有花中有花，奇花交错的东风绸。这里，山水、人物、云彩、花鸟是如此巧妙地被安排着，中外古今的优秀图案是如此调和地被运用着。这里，有的富丽堂皇，有的古色古香，有的淡如秋水，有的明似春光。
    这些丝绸在国内国外获得了越来越多的人们的喜爱。当它们在苏联、匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国等兄弟国家展出时、曾经被称赞为“像水一样的轻柔，像诗一样的美妙”。这些丝绸也曾经轰动过巴黎，诱惑过里昂的妇女们。在莱比锡举办的一次国际博览会上，浙江丝绸被评为富有高度艺术性的第一流丝织品。现在，有六十多个国家的许多人们购用浙江丝绸，制成他（她）们心爱的衣衫和装饰品。
    被称为丝绸故乡的浙江省，有着悠久的丝绸生产的历史。不少精美的品种在很早就出现了，花色也在不断地发展着。到过浙江省中部、浙赣路边沿的诸暨县的人，一定要去看看古代美女西施的家乡苧萝村，在村边沿着浦阳江的石壁上，可以清晰地看到大书法家王羲之写的“浣纱”两个刻字。“纱”就是一种晶莹的丝织品。后来，西施被范蠡送给越王勾践，穿上了“罗穀”，这就是立体花纹的丝织品。可见，在距今二千多年以前，浙江省手工丝织品的技艺已经相当高明。
    唐、宋、元、明、清，浙江一带的织绸生产都很发达。唐代诗人白居易写过咏“缭绫”的诗，其中说：“去年中使宣口敕，天上取样人间织，织为云外秋雁行，染作江南春水色”。诗人把当时的丝绸生产描绘成一幅多么优美的图画：一行秋雁剪破云采，展翅高飞，而天空的颜色，却染成像江南的春水一样。
    但是，到解放以前的几十年，浙江省丝绸生产雕零了。日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的剥削、掠夺和扼杀政策，使数以千计的机户和分散在各地的工厂透不过气来，许多机子被弄来出卖，织机的木料当柴烧，产量一落千丈，根本谈不上搞什么花色品种，只有几个老品种在机子上织来织去，黯然无色。这种局面，到1949年浙江省解放才宣告结束。
    人民掌握了政权以后，在党和政府的关心、扶持下，许多长期停歇的机器又重新转动起来，生产不断上升。此后，随着社会主义改造的进行，现代化丝绸印染联合工厂的建设，浙江省的丝绸工业出现了空前繁荣景象。十年来，不但绸缎的生产量早已超过历史上的最高水平，绸缎的品种花色也日新月异，春色满园。据统计，这十年内已经设计出一千多个新品种和四千多个新花样，其新颖别致，已不是历史上任何时期所可比拟。
    人们都知道，绸缎是经丝和纬丝组织起来的。丝绸设计员就是利用这些五颜六色的生丝交叉时发出的千变万化的光彩，巧妙地设计出各种各样的新品种；再根据每个新品种的特点，设计出许多不同图案的新花样。
    浙江省在解放以前，没有一个从事花色品种设计的专职人员。解放以后，许多具有丰富丝绸生产经验的老艺人，被安排在新设立的设计员岗位上。公私合营后，许多原来分散在各个私营丝织工厂的设计员，又先后集中到新成立的胜利丝织试样厂来，共聚一堂，各施特长。设计工作者为了创造出更多的品种花样，纷纷跨出办公室，接触着祖国辽阔的生活实际，金星灿烂的高炉，一望无际的稻浪，舞台上柔和的灯光和形象优美的动作，商店橱窗里的每一件新产品，马路上出现的一切，都成了他们的新题材。多少设计员就是这样创造出了受人赞扬的新绸缎。他们使老产品花样更多，更加美丽；他们使新产品不断出现，日新月异。
    胜利丝织试样厂设计员马祖根最近创造的新品种“丽纹锦”，就是获得好评的许多新品种中间的一种。这个品种的绸面上织着彩色条子，条子之间繁花似锦，看起来，像在春天的公园里隔着栏杆看盛开的百花一样，层次分明，浓淡适度，充满了无限的诗情和画意饱和着无限的生命力。这个品种是怎样创造的呢？原来马祖根办公室的窗子上有一幅竹帘，他每天走进办公室就看到它。去年秋天，他对这帘子特别感到兴趣，经常仔细观看，帘子迎风摇曳，发出轻微的响声，帘上的阳光，忽浓忽淡，帘外的景物，也就忽隐忽现，这样看了几个月，一个新品种的图案就在他脑子里成熟了。
    银发满头的马祖根，在丝织厂里生活了三十五年。头二十五年辗转在苏州、上海、湖州、杭州等地，换了十几个丝织厂，失业、饥饿，被人瞧不起，英雄无用武之地。解放后，他换了另一个样子，工作安定，生活一天天向上，党对设计工作者的重视，使他非常激动。他在胜利丝织试样厂和其他设计员一起，创造了很多出名的新品种。有一种叫虹霓绢，在灯光下看起来，像水上的波浪，发射着起伏的光芒。这是他和设计员李次珊共同研究创造的。他们参考了中外许多有关杂志和画册，分析了好几种颜色，并使之变成一个色彩，成功地设计出这个品种。马祖根和设计员宋润溥合作，创造了金银龙缎，这是浙江丝绸史上采用多种纤维的开始。在国际市场上很受欢迎的东风绸，也是马祖根的创造。这种绸子，既有印花，又有提花，还有挖花，充分表现出浙江省的丝绸设计已经达到了很高的水平。
    谈起浙江丝绸的花色品种来，不能不说到“织锦”。这些多种颜色的丝织人像、丝织风景像、丝织台毯面和丝织坐垫面，被称为丝绸中的“奇花异葩”。欣赏这些丝织品的画面，真为之心旷神怡。看吧，北海的白塔，苏州狮子林的石群，黄山的云海高峰，杭州云栖的竹径通幽，月夜西湖泛轻舟，八月钱江观大潮，一个个的景色，各具特色，给人以这样的感觉：一根丝也不能多，一根丝也不能少。
    这些丝织品的生产，集中在现在已经名驰中外的都锦生丝织厂。这个工厂成立于1922年。解放以前，全部产品用手工织造，幅面不大，颜色采用不多。抗日战争以后，生产更不稳定，靠借外债维持门面。一解放，这个厂就一步步地发展起来，质量日益提高，销路日益扩大。工人边仁连试用电机织锦成功，不但产量提高了七倍，又使这一生产开始进入一个新的阶段。企业公私合营，更加激发了广大工人的生产积极性。他们不断充实着织锦画面的内容，而且织出了又高又大、颜色众多的织锦。
    二十九岁的挡车工金祖灿，是这个厂许多出色的工人之一。他从一个农民变成织绸工，已经十一年了。在党的培育下，他熟练地掌握了织台毯的技术。这种技术本来是比较复杂的，而他现在已经和其他工人一样，能同时挡两台机子，最高挡过四台，这些天，在他的机子上，正在织造有“佛香阁”古画的台毯，五把梭子带着五种颜色的纬丝在机上穿来穿去。织成这样的一幅台毯，梭子要来回一万多次，一次也不能乱；而电机织锦，梭子又运行很快，很不容易掌握。可是由于他的准备工作做得好，在工作时又看视得非常严密，任何一根丝穿行错了，都逃不过他的眼睛，两手马上予以纠正。这样，眼看着绸面上逐渐出现了古木参天、亭台楼阁依稀掩映的画面。一幅台毯织成以后，另一幅又开始了。
    由二十多种颜色织成的古画“金谷园”描写着在一层层巍峨的古代大建筑中，各种不同的人物表现着各种不同的神情，画面十分动人。一位老工人正坐在手拉织绸机上织着这幅风景像，面前摆着一排梭子，两手不慌不忙地运用着它们。他的眼睛注视着梭上纬丝的颜色。这里，水绿色和湖色，大红色和火黄色，深灰色和淡灰色，相差无几，是不容易分清的。可是他工作时手眼俱到，一丝不错。这些工人已经养成了对颜色的锐敏的辨别力。
    在丝织像中，有许多画面反映了社会主义建设的情景。长江大桥飞架在江面上，姿态雄伟；武钢一号高炉的夜景，灯光炉火交相辉映，透露出工人们的冲天干劲；第一汽车制造厂的高大建筑物，显示着建设的巨大规模，令人神往。还有许多丝织像采用了名画家的作品，齐白石画的虾子，是那样的富有生机；徐悲鸿画的骏马，栩栩如生，像要跃出画面”。
    一位波兰工程师参观了都锦生丝织厂，留言道：我们很高兴能够看到这座每个工人都是艺术家的工厂。”这是多么令人激动的评价啊！
