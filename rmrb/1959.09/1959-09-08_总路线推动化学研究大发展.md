    The General Line Promotes Great Development in Chemical Research
    Wu Xuezhou, Director of the Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    After reading the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, I felt extremely excited. The Party has issued a battle call to us: to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, to catch up with the UK's level in the output of important industrial products five years ahead of schedule, and to realize the Twelve-Year Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. What an amazing miracle, how can it not inspire people to fight bravely and work with soaring enthusiasm!
    Under the encouragement of the great leap forward situation across the country, the Institute of Applied Chemistry has also launched a great leap forward in scientific research. In more than a year, it has achieved great results, surpassing the sum of the achievements of previous years. Some of these projects were originally planned to be completed in the Second or Third Five-Year Plans of the scientific plan, such as separating and purifying fifteen rare earth elements after fighting for more than ten days and nights, and solving the separation process of rare earth elements in less than three weeks. Without the Party's general line and the promotion of the great leap forward situation, it is unimaginable to achieve such great results. Through last year's Great Leap Forward, all the staff of our institute firmly established the belief that: scientific research must be led by the Party, scientific research must serve production and construction, and scientific research must follow the mass line. Such a firm belief has had and will continue to have a profound impact on the development of our institute's work.
    On the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, our institute, based on the existing work foundation and combined with the needs of the country, formulated this year's research work plan. I have full confidence and determination to, under the leadership of the Party, work with all comrades in the institute to make more brilliant achievements with full enthusiasm to dedicate to the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    总路线推动化学研究大发展
    中国科学院应用化学研究所所长　吴学周
    读了党的八届八中全会的公报和决议以后，感到无比兴奋。党已向我们发出了战斗的号召：提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，提前五年在重要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平，提前实现十二年农业发展纲要。这是多么惊人的奇迹，怎能不激起人们英勇奋战，干劲冲天。
    应用化学研究所在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，也掀起了科学研究大跃进。在一年多的时间内，取得了巨大的成绩，胜过以往几年成绩的总和。其中有些项目是在科学规划中原定第二个五年计划或第三个五年计划才能完成的，如奋战十几个昼夜分离纯制十五个希土元素，不到三个星期解决了希土元素的分离流程。没有党的总路线，没有大跃进形势的推动，要取得如此巨大的成绩是不可想像的。通过去年的大跃进，我所全体人员坚定地树立了：科学研究必须有党的领导，科学研究必须为生产建设服务，以及科学研究必须走群众路线的信念。这样一个坚定的信念，对我所工作的发展，已经起着并将继续起着极其深远的影响。
    在去年大跃进的基础上，我所根据已有的工作基础，和结合国家的需要，拟订了今年的研究工作计划。我完全有信心和决心在党的领导下，与全所同志一道，以十足的干劲做出更辉煌的成绩献给伟大的国庆十周年。
