Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 23rd: During the intense battle of August and September, Shanghai's steel industry saw a steady rise in output per ten-day period, a general improvement in quality, and a reduction in iron consumption. The national red flags for high yield in converters and small open-hearth furnaces are planted in Shanghai, and the red flags are being raised ever higher. Judging from the development trend of the current excellent production situation, it is possible to complete the state plan for this year's annual steel production of 1.65 million tons fifteen days ahead of schedule.

Entering August, the Party's call for "opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously increasing production and practicing economy" ignited the soaring drive of Shanghai's steelworkers and cadres. They criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of a few cadres and launched an even more enthusiastic red flag competition. On the basis of the average daily output of more than 3,900 tons achieved in the intense battle against high temperatures in July, the average daily output in August increased to more than 5,200 tons. In September, encouraged by the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the production situation was even better. Since the 7th, the daily output has often remained around 7,000 tons, and new records of 7,823 tons and 8,661 tons were created on the 10th and 20th.

The old red flags of steelmaking nationwide -- the open-hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6, and the first converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 -- all saw significant improvements in their production levels in these two months. For example, the first converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, which has four six-ton converters, produced an average of 25.76 tons of steel per ton of equipment per day in July, which is 5 to 15 tons more steel than the general converter output in other regions. In August, the workers in this workshop criticized the complacent and relaxed mood of a few cadres and further tapped the potential of the equipment, often maintaining three furnaces blowing simultaneously, and sometimes even four furnaces blowing simultaneously. The utilization coefficient soared to 32.74. In September, despite the impact of storms, insufficient supply of pig iron, and equipment maintenance, the utilization coefficient in the first two ten-day periods still reached as high as 34.6, an increase compared to August.

The three large converter workshops with the same scale that were newly built during the Great Leap Forward last year -- the second converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, the second converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, and the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 -- closely followed, competed for leadership, and achieved high yields over a large area. The second converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 worked hard to improve operating techniques and production management, and also learned from the advanced experience of the old red flags of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 and the first converter workshop of its own plant in areas such as stockyard management and blast furnace operation, and took the lead in breaking through the 1,000-ton daily output mark. Then, the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 immediately learned the experience of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 and No. 3, and also reached the level of 1,000 tons per day. Especially since September 7, these two major new workshops have always competed for the lead between 1,000 and 1,300 tons of daily output. The second converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, which had lagged behind earlier, is now catching up and is approaching the level of 1,000 tons per day.

In each steelmaking workshop, there is a gratifying situation of simultaneous progress and comprehensive blossoming between shifts and between furnaces. Taking the situation of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 from September 1 to 20 as an example, today you are ahead, and tomorrow he is ahead, but after the total output of the twenty days is settled, the three shifts are almost exactly the same.

This new situation of leaping forward again and again on Shanghai's steel front is the result of the hard work of the broad masses of workers and staff under the direct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in overcoming numerous difficulties this year. This year, the biggest difficulty they encountered in striving for a greater leap forward in steel production was the high sulfur content in the pig iron they used. However, the workers fought against the high sulfur from the stockyard, blast furnace, and converter, all the way to the site for brick making, furnace building, and furnace baking, and finally achieved victory, broke through a series of technical barriers such as "eating earth iron," "blast furnace hanging material and scaffolding," "converter furnace life," "using less iron to make more steel," and "improving first-grade product rate," and created many good experiences, and gradually mastered the production law of achieving a comprehensive leap forward in high yield, high quality, and low consumption with high-sulfur pig iron.

The strong desire to overfulfill this year's steel production task of 1.65 million tons greatly motivated the workers to stubbornly overcome various difficulties. An incident occurred at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 in August. At the plant-wide workers' oath-taking meeting for a leap forward, Xia Lianfa, a worker from Zhao Yuming's team in the first converter workshop, guaranteed to the meeting on behalf of his team that they would exceed the converter furnace life target of 45 heats proposed by the workshop. However, the next morning, the furnace rocker accidentally damaged the wind hole, and the furnace life was only 28 heats, and it also caused the next shift of workers to produce 100 tons less steel. Xia Lianfa, who was always strong and cheerful, cried in a hurry, and the workers in the whole team and the whole workshop were also shocked. On the third day, Xia Lianfa and the workers in the team strictly implemented the operating procedures, carefully protected the furnace, and seized every minute and second to shorten the smelting time, so that the furnace life reached 69 heats. Averaging the two furnace lives, they reached 48.5 heats, fulfilling the guarantee they had made. The workers and Party organization in the entire workshop came to support this team and tried to get all four furnaces in the workshop running. On this day, more than 100 tons of steel were produced more than usual, making up for the loss. Xia Lianfa's team also created a new record of making 19 heats of steel in one furnace in eight hours.

The strong desire to strive to overfulfill 1.65 million tons of steel also made advanced experience spread faster and more timely. Wherever new experience appeared, the workers immediately rushed to learn from it. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6's experience in strictly controlling post-blowing and other aspects is good, which is of great benefit to improving the quality of steel and extending the converter furnace life. Therefore, the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 sent all the workers of various major types of work to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 to visit and learn, and after returning, all nine steelmaking teams in the workshop promoted it. As a result, the converter furnace life increased from an average of 37.3 heats in the first half of August to 51.9 heats at once. The average daily output of the second converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 originally led the three major workshops newly built during the Great Leap Forward last year, but recently the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 quickly caught up, and on September 10, it created a new record of 1,200 tons per day, exceeding the highest level of the second converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3. Therefore, the deputy director of the second converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 led more than 70 steelmaking workers and furnace building workers to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 to learn the experience of extending furnace life and controlling post-blowing, and created an even higher record of 1,299 tons per day on the 21st.

Frequently launching debates on the two lines of "striving for progress" and "right-leaning conservatism" to keep cadres and the masses in high spirits is one of the important factors for the continuous rise in Shanghai's steel production. When the first converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 was discussing the plan for the second half of the year, some cadres believed that the average daily output in June was 670 tons, and after fully tapping the potential in the second half of the year, it could increase to more than 750 tons. However, some people thought that this target was too high, and they raised a large list of difficulties in the workshop's equipment, technology, and manpower, and believed that the average daily output could only increase by a maximum of 10%, and advocated setting the target at the level of 730 tons. After debating and analyzing the current production situation, everyone believed that a target without difficulties must be a conservative and backward target; as long as we boost our morale and actively create conditions, it is entirely possible to reach a daily output of 750 tons. In July and August, they successively solved the problems of improving the quality of furnace building and improving the steel ingot casting capacity. Sure enough, the daily output quickly exceeded the level of 750 tons, and the average daily output in August reached 800 tons.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has always paid close attention to steel production. The Municipal Party Secretary learns about the steel production situation and problems every day, often goes to the factory to help solve difficulties, and sometimes works with the workers. The Municipal Party Committee specially sent the Deputy Director of the Industrial Production Committee and the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Industry to the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 to participate in leading the work; it also transferred a group of relatively strong cadres from the District Party Committee and various departments to serve as workshop directors and workshop Party branch secretaries to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level.

    鼓起冲天干劲，夺取一百六十五万吨好钢
    上海争取提前半月完成全年钢产计划
    生产形势好得很，八九两月产量逐旬上升，日产水平创造八千六百多吨新纪录
    据新华社上海23日电　上海钢铁工业在大战8、9两月中，产量逐旬上升，质量普遍提高，铁耗也有下降。全国转炉、小型平炉的高产红旗都插在上海，而且红旗越举越高。从目前生产大好形势的发展趋势来看，可以提前十五天完成今年全年产钢一百六十五万吨的国家计划。
    进入8月，党的“反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约”的号召，鼓起了上海钢铁工人和干部的冲天干劲。他们批判了少数干部存在的右倾保守思想，展开了更加热烈的红旗竞赛。在7月份大战高温取得平均日产三千九百多吨成绩的基础上，8月份平均日产量提高到五千二百多吨；9月份在迎接建国十周年的鼓舞下，生产形势更好了，从7日以来，日产量经常保持在七千吨上下，并且在10日和20日创造了产钢七千八百二十三吨和八千六百六十一吨的新纪录。
    全国炼钢的老红旗——上钢三厂平炉、上钢六厂和上钢三厂第一转炉车间，这两月的生产水平都有显著提高。如拥有四只六吨转炉的上钢三厂第一转炉车间，7月份平均每一吨设备每一天炼钢二十五点七六吨。比各地的转炉一般要多炼五吨到十五吨钢。8月份，这个车间职工批判了少数干部的自满松劲情绪，进一步挖掘设备潜力，经常保持三只炉子同时吹炼，有时甚至四只炉子同时吹炼，利用系数猛升到三二点七四。9月份，虽然碰到狂风暴雨，生铁供应不上，以及检修设备的影响，但是上中两旬的利用系数仍然高达三四点六，比8月份又有上升。
    去年大跃进中才新建起来的三个规模相同的大型转炉车间——上钢一厂第二转炉车间、上钢三厂第二转炉车间和上钢五厂转炉车间，紧步跟上，互争先锋，取得了大面积高产。上钢三厂第二转炉车间努力改进操作技术和生产管理，又学习了上钢六厂和本厂第一转炉车间两面老红旗的料场管理、化铁炉操作等方面的先进经验，首先突破了日产一千吨大关。接着，上钢五厂转炉车间马上把上钢六厂和三厂的经验学过来，也达到了日产一千吨的水平。特别是从9月7日以来，这两大新车间总是在日产一千到一千三百吨之间互争高低。前些时候落在后面的上钢一厂第二转炉车间，现在也追上来了，接近日产一千吨的水平。
    在各个炼钢车间里面，又出现了班与班、炉与炉之间齐头并进、全面开花的可喜局面。以上钢六厂9月1日到20日的情况为例，今天你领先，明天他又领先，但是二十天的总产量结算下来，三个班几乎完全一样。
    上海钢铁战线上这种跃进再跃进的新形势，是今年以来广大职工群众在中共上海市委直接领导下，战胜了重重困难才取得的。今年以来，他们在争取钢铁生产的更大跃进中，碰到的最大困难是所用的生铁中含硫很高。但是，职工们从料场、化铁炉、转炉，一直到制砖、砌炉、烘炉的场地与高硫展开搏斗，终于取得了胜利，闯过了“吃土铁”、“化铁炉挂料搭棚”、“转炉炉龄”、“少用铁多炼钢”、“提高一级品率”等一系列的技术关，创造了很多好的经验，逐步掌握了用高硫生铁达到高产、优质、低耗全面跃进的生产规律。
    一定要超额完成今年产钢一百六十五万吨任务的强烈愿望，大大地推动了职工们去顽强地克服各种困难。上钢三厂8月份曾发生过这样一件事，在全厂职工的跃进誓师大会上，第一转炉车间赵玉明小组的工人夏连发，代表本小组向大会保证要超过车间提出的四十五炉的转炉炉龄指标。但是，就在第二天早上，摇炉工人不慎，把风眼弄坏了，炉龄只有二十八炉，而且还使得下一班工人少生产了一百吨钢。一向刚强、愉快的夏连发，急得哭了起来，全小组和全车间的工人也很震动。第三天，夏连发和小组工人严格执行操作规程，精心地保护炉子，抓紧缩短一分一秒的冶炼时间，使炉龄达到了六十九炉；两次炉龄平均起来，达到四十八点五炉，实现了自己提出来的保证。全车间的工人和党组织，都来支持这个小组，设法把车间的四只炉子全部开动起来。这一天，比平时多炼了一百多吨钢，补上了损失。夏连发所在的小组，更创造了八小时一只炉子炼十九炉钢的新纪录。
    力争超额完成一百六十五万吨钢的强烈愿望，也使得先进经验传播得更快更及时了。哪里出现了新的经验，工人们就马上赶到那里去学习。上钢六厂严格控制后吹等方面的经验好，对提高钢的质量和延长转炉炉龄都有很大好处。于是，上钢五厂转炉车间就把各个主要工种的工人，全部开到六厂去参观学习，回来后全车间九个炼钢小组都进行推广。因此，转炉炉龄由8月上半月平均三十七点三炉一下子提高到五十一点九炉。上钢三厂第二转炉车间的平均日产量，本来在去年大跃进中新建的三大车间中遥遥领先，但是最近上钢五厂转炉车间迅速赶上来了，而且在9月10日还创造了日产一千二百吨的新纪录，超过了上钢三厂第二转炉车间的最高水平。于是，上钢三厂第二转炉车间的副主任，带了七十多位炼钢工人和砌炉工人，赶到上钢五厂去学习延长炉龄、控制后吹等方面的经验，在21日创造了日产一千二百九十九吨的更高纪录。
    经常展开“力争上游”和“右倾保守”两条路线的辩论，使干部和群众保持着旺盛的士气，是上海钢的生产不断上升的重要因素之一。上钢三厂第一转炉车间在讨论下半年度计划时，有些干部认为6月份的平均日产量是六百七十吨，下半年充分挖掘潜力后，可以增长到七百五十吨以上。但是，有人认为这一指标太高了，他们提出了车间里设备、技术、人力等方面的一大串困难，认为平均日产量最多增长10％，主张把指标订在七百三十吨的水平上。经过辩论和分析当前生产形势以后，大家认为没有困难的指标，一定是保守落后的指标；只要鼓足干劲、积极创造条件，达到日产七百五十吨是完全可能的。在7、8两月份中，他们接连解决了提高砌炉质量、提高钢锭浇注能力等问题，果然，日产量迅速地超过了七百五十吨水平；8月份的平均日产量，又达到了八百吨。
    中共上海市委对钢的生产一直抓得很紧。市委书记每天都要了解钢的生产情况和问题，常常下厂帮助解决困难，有时还同工人们一起劳动。市委专门派出工业生产委员会副主任和工业部副部长，到市冶金局和上钢一厂参加领导工作；还从区委、各部门抽调了一批比较强的干部，担任车间主任和车间党总支书记，加强基层的领导。
