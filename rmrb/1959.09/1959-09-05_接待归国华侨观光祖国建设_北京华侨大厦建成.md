Xinhua News Agency, 4th. To receive overseas Chinese returning to visit the motherland’s construction, the “Overseas Chinese Mansion” has been completed.

The central part of this building is eight stories high, and the two wings are each seven stories high, with a construction area of more than 13,300 square meters. The foundation of the mansion is built with granite, and the walls are covered with light yellow facing bricks, complemented by water-brushed stone eaves, which appear simple, beautiful, and generous.

The ground floor of the mansion has an oval central hall. From the central hall, you can take an elevator or go up the stairs. There are 170 guest rooms of three different types on the third to seventh floors. The rooms are sunny, and equipped with heating, plumbing, and telephones. Further up, the eighth floor has a social hall; on the roofs of the two wings, one side is an open-air dance floor, and the other side is a roof garden, where you can overlook the entire city.

Going south from the central hall, the first and second floors of the mansion have restaurants. The first floor is open to the public and can accommodate 300 people at the same time; the second floor serves residents, with Chinese and Western dining rooms, which can accommodate 400 people at the same time. The Datong Restaurant, which is loved by overseas Chinese, will open a branch here. Going east from the central hall, the first floor has a photography department and a barber shop. The China Photography Studio, which specializes in art photography, will also open a branch here. The second floor is the office space for the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

This mansion, located on the northern section of Wangfujing Avenue in Beijing, was designed by the Beijing Municipal Design Institute and constructed by the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Management Bureau Housing Construction Company. This company mainly undertook housing repair work in the past, and it was the first time to build such a mansion, but under the illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the employees worked hard with the spirit of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and completed this building quickly and well. When the relevant departments jointly inspected and accepted it, the evaluation was: "Fast speed and excellent project quality." (Attached picture)

    接待归国华侨观光祖国建设
    北京华侨大厦建成
    新华社4日讯　接待华侨回国观光的“华侨大厦”已经落成。
    这座大厦中部高达八层，两翼各为七层，建筑面积有一万三千三百多平方米。大厦墙基是用花岗石砌成的，墙面贴有浅黄色的面砖，配上水刷石檐头，显得朴素、美观、大方。
    大厦底层有一个椭圆形的中央大厅。从中央大厅可以乘坐电梯或者沿楼梯而上。三层至七层楼共有三种不同类型的客房一百七十套。室内阳光充足，水暖、电话等设备齐全。再往上，八层楼设有交谊厅；两翼屋顶上，一边是露天舞池，一边是屋顶花园，在这里，能眺望全城景色。
    从中央大厅往南，大厦的一、二层设有餐厅。一层对外营业，可容三百人同时进餐；二层对住客服务，分中、西餐室，可容四百人同时进餐。华侨所喜爱的大同酒家将在这里开设分号。从中央大厅往东，一层设有照相部、理发部，擅长美术照相的中国照相馆也将在这里开设分店。二层楼是中华全国归国华侨联合会和北京市归国华侨联合会的办公场所。
    这个座落在北京王府大街北段的大厦，是北京市设计院设计的。由北京市房地产管理局房屋修建公司负责施工。这个公司过去主要是担任房屋修缮工作，建筑这样的大厦还是第一次，但是在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，职工们以鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，艰苦奋斗，结果又快又好地完成了这座建筑。有关部门联合验收时给它的评语是：“速度快，工程质量优良。”（附图片）
