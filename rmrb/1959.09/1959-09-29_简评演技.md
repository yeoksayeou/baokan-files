    Brief Commentary on Acting
    Lao She
    Jin Shan, Zhao Dan, and Cui Wei are my three favorite actors. Jin Shan and Zhao Dan have a wide range of acting styles, playing dragons like dragons and tigers like tigers, "mastering all genres," rich and varied. But precisely because of this, sometimes they still reveal a slight trace of acting. This is not to find fault, but to illustrate how difficult it is to master acting techniques. The talented, experienced, and serious performances of comrades Jin and Zhao have always given me lasting joy.
    Whenever I see the performances of these two actors, I can't help but think of Comrade Zhou Xinfang, who has established his own school in the Peking Opera world. Although their teachings are different and their techniques vary, they both give me the same joy. After watching their plays or movies, I feel like I truly understand something about acting techniques. The people and events they portray move me, and their acting also moves me, making me unable to help but exclaim: They are truly artists! After such praise, I think I should learn from them. Although they are actors and I can only compose a few prose sentences, I can see that their achievements come from diligent study, hard practice, and constant research. I should learn from their tireless pursuit of knowledge and their perseverance in striving for excellence!
  I have seen fewer plays and movies starring Comrade Cui Wei. However, I like him. I feel that no matter what play he is in, he is always himself, and yet he is exactly the character he plays. I rarely see traces of him acting. He is so calm, unhurried, kind, and lovable that when you put him in a story, he naturally becomes a lovable character in the play. I don't know how to express my meaning more clearly. Well, let me try to say a few more words: As soon as he appears on the screen, I want to give him a big thumbs up. Good! This is Comrade Cui Wei! He is so cheerful and generous that I feel comfortable in my heart. After watching him for a while, I forget Comrade Cui Wei and recognize a character in the play, who is cheerful and generous, both like Cui Wei and not like Cui Wei. Naturally, Cui Wei transforms into a hero in the play and makes people believe that the hero is exactly like that.
    I haven't had the opportunity to ask Comrade Cui Wei about his acting secrets, so I can't say how he created his own acting style.
    Different people have different opinions, and it is impossible to force agreement. My opinion may not be correct. Fortunately, Comrade Cui Wei's starring role in "The New Story of an Old Soldier" is about to be released, so everyone can take a look. How the plot of this film unfolds and what its advantages are are all secondary; what I recommend is Comrade Cui Wei's unique acting style. He is not just playing the "old soldier" there; he makes us believe that he *is* that "old soldier." (Attached picture)

    简评演技
    老舍
    金山、赵丹和崔嵬是我最喜爱的三大演员。金山与赵丹的演技路子宽，装龙像龙，装虎似虎，“昆乱不挡”，丰富多彩。可也正因如此，所以有时候还微露作戏的痕迹。这不是挑剔毛病，而是说明表演技术是多么难以掌握。金、赵二同志的有才华有经验和态度严肃的表演，一向给我长久不忘的喜悦。
    每逢看到这二位演员的表演，我就不由地联想到戏曲界自成一家的周信芳同志。尽管他们的传授不同，技法各异，可是他们都使我得到同样的欣喜。看完了他们的戏或电影，我觉得真地明白了一些什么是表演技术。他们所演的人与事感动了我，他们的演技也感动了我，叫我不能不赞叹：他们真是艺术家啊！这样赞美之后，我就想应当向他们学习。虽然他们是演员，我只会诌几句散文，可是我会看到他们的成就是由勤学苦练，不断钻研而来。我应当学习他们的好学不倦，力求精进的恒心与毅力！
  崔嵬同志演的戏与电影，我看的较少。可是，我喜爱他。我觉得：不管他演什么戏，他总是他，而他又恰好是他所扮演的人物。很少看出他作戏的痕迹。他是那么从容不迫，亲切可爱，把他放在一个故事里，他就自自然然地成为可爱的剧中人。我不知道怎样把我的意思说得更清楚些。那么，就再多说两句试试吧：他一出现在银幕上，我就想给他叫个碰头好。好！这是崔嵬同志！他是那么爽朗大方，使我感到心里舒服。看来看去，我忘了崔嵬同志，而认识了一个剧中人，爽爽朗朗的既像崔嵬，又不是崔嵬。极自然地，崔嵬化成了剧中的一位英雄，而且使人相信，那位英雄就正是这个样子。
    我还没有机会向崔嵬同志请教他的表演诀窍，所以我说不上来他是怎样创造了自己的表演风格的。
    见仁见智，无可强同。我的看法不见得正确。好在崔嵬同志主演的“老兵新传”即将公映，大家看看吧。这部片子的情节如何，优点何在，都不在话下，我推荐的是崔嵬同志的独具风格的演技。他不是在那儿扮演“老兵”，他叫我们相信他就是那位“老兵”。（附图片）
