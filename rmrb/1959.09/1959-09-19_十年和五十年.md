Ten Years and Fifty Years
	Zhou Xinfang

	Counting from my debut at the age of seven, my stage life has been almost sixty years. But it was only in the past ten years since the founding of the country that I truly realized the meaning of stage life and appreciated the joy of stage life.

	In art, I have always opposed "closed-doorism." In my early years, I was fortunate to often see the performance of "Sheng (male role) Master" Tan Xinpei; I performed on the same stage for a long time with senior artists Wang Xiaonong and Wang Hongshou (Old San Mazi); I was very interested in the singing of Hua Lian (painted face role) Liu Yongchun and the creative roles of Hua Dan (female role) Feng Zihe... However, only after liberation did I realize how many heavy curtains the old society placed between us artists, isolating us from each other, preventing us from exchanging ideas in art, and making us feel like strangers in emotion.

	In 1952, the National Opera Performance was held. Through this grand exchange performance, I suddenly realized that the motherland's opera art is so vast and profound. Whether it is the elder brothers of Qinqiang and Kunqu opera, or the younger brothers and sisters of Yue opera and Ping opera, under the cultivation and irrigation of the Communist Party, they have all grown so strong and blossomed so beautifully without exception. This made me deeply realize how important a good social system is for the development of art, for artistic exchange, and for the growth of art workers.

	Under the promotion and assistance of the Party, in the past few years, I have made comprehensive revisions and reorganizations to the more than ten repertoires that I often perform, which are generally recognized as excellent. I and the comrades who assisted me in this work re-evaluated the roles, re-interpreted the events, made necessary new arrangements for the plots, and appropriately embellished the lyrics and lines. After this revision and reorganization, the distorted revolutionary hero Song Jiang is no longer a boring whoremonger, and "Killing Xi" is no longer a jealous killing or a vendetta. What is reflected from this general event of male-female relationships is the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. In the play "Drawing a Portrait on the Road," with reference to the local opera performance script, I made the care and love of the kind old man Zhang Guangcai for the virtuous young woman Zhao Wuniang more humanized. I want the advice and exhortations of this fatherly figure to express the voices of thousands of viewers. After this thorough revision, the spiritual outlook of several roles has changed, the spiritual qualities of some characters have been sublimated, and a new situation that is more concise and more beautiful has appeared on the stage. This is the embodiment of the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," and without the leadership of the Party, this situation would never have been possible.

	In 1955, after the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government held a grand "50th Anniversary of Stage Life Commemoration" and observation performance for me and my old friend Mei Lanfang, another of my wishes was also realized. The Central Government arranged for me an eight-month tour performance. We traveled to ten cities in five provinces in Northeast, North, and East China. I sought advice from various places with my immature art, and at the same time got the best opportunity to seriously learn from the achievements and experiences of various local opera types. In 1958, I once again had the opportunity to tour for six months. Our footprints traveled through eleven cities in seven provinces in Central South, Southwest, Northwest, and North China. We saw more excellent art of ancient opera types.

	Through a series of contacts and exchanges during the tour, the first thing that is unforgettable for me is that the relationship between people has completely changed. The phenomenon that people are now separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but become as close as siblings when they meet, was something I never encountered when I "ran the docks" before liberation. People respectfully call me an old artist, invite me to watch operas everywhere, invite me to give reports and hold forums everywhere, there are enthusiastic smiling faces everywhere, and people want to become my students everywhere. Interestingly, the "Qi School" was originally an artistic school popular in the Jiangnan region, and most of my students are Peking Opera actors from Jiangnan, but now even the Peking Opera troupe of the Volunteer Army stationed in Korea at that time has my disciples.

	During the two periods from 1956 to 1957, I also visited the Soviet Union with many comrades from the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater, and gave visiting performances in eight cities including Moscow. This visit to the Soviet Union was a major event that I will never forget. When Soviet art masters with high artistic accomplishments shook hands with me and praised the great achievements of Chinese opera art in enthusiastic tones, my first reaction in my heart was: as a Chinese opera actor, today, I am more respected than at any time in the past, and therefore my responsibility is even greater.

	In order to inherit and develop the heritage, and to expand the repertoire, in recent years, I have been committed to the work of unearthing and re-evaluating the repertoire that has been retained in the past. Among them, I re-organized the dramas "Hatred of Lutai," "Board of Life and Death," "Slashing the Sutra Hall" and so on, and newly rehearsed "Fifteen Strings of Cash" and created "Righteously Blaming Wang Kui." This is only a very small number in terms of repertoire creation, and I see it as the beginning of a new stage in my stage life.

	Personal level is limited, and personal strength is meager. I am determined to start with myself first, and record my performing arts in writing first, for the reference of opera art theorists when conducting research work. The Party is very concerned about my artistic life, and under the leadership of the Party, this artistic recording work has already begun.

	Speaking of artistic recording, I cannot help but think of the Party's vigorous promotion of various schools of opera art. Due to some of my characteristics in performance, in the long process of stage practice, a school has unconsciously formed, which people call the "Qi School." Many experts, like many other schools, have done a lot of insightful research on the "Qi School." They analyzed and summarized the main characteristics of my performing arts and elaborated on them in theory. We must continue to promote some of our advantages, and overcome and correct our many shortcomings. Unless under the leadership of the Communist Party, which government has the heart and interest to promote any art schools! No wonder a Soviet art colleague grasped my hand enthusiastically and said: "Chairman Mao's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend fully shows that China is the most civilized and most advanced country."

	Another major event in my stage life in the past ten years is constantly performing for workers, peasants and soldiers. I have been to the Korean battlefield and the coastal defense front several times, squeezing into tunnels and standing on the coast to perform for the brave soldiers who guard the motherland's gateway day and night. I have also made a special trip to the most remote construction site in Northeast China to perform for the heavy industrial workers who are working hard to accelerate socialist construction. I often go to the countryside in the distant or nearby suburbs with my comrades, stand on the green fields, work with the peasants, and sing a few songs for them to encourage their production enthusiasm.

	When you perform on the high platform of the square, facing tens of thousands of soldiers sitting upright, when you find that the rain falls on them, they still stare at your performance motionless, you can't help but feel a thousand kinds of thoughts surge into your heart. What kind of audience is this! Performing a play for them, who can not regard it as a lifelong honor and happiness!

	Compared with any other decade in the past, my stage life in this decade is much fuller; it can also be said that the things done in these ten years, both in quantity and quality, exceed the sum of the past nearly fifty years. Every time I think of the great honors and generous treatment given to me by the Party and the people - awarding me an honorary award in the National Opera Performance, holding a "50th Anniversary of Stage Life Commemoration" for me and Mei Lanfang, allowing me to participate in the leadership work of the opera circle through various important work positions, electing me as a representative of the National People's Congress, and recently accepting me as a glorious Communist Party member, every time I think of these, I can't help but feel ashamed and deeply feel the importance of my responsibility.

	Fortunately, sixty years old is not yet old age, and ten years of the founding of the country is only a start in the 25,000-mile Long March of the great cause of socialism and communism. The future is long, and I am determined to, under the leadership of the Party and under the supervision of the people, be loyal and sincere, and fight to the end for the great proletarian cause, in order to repay the Party and the people for their long-term cultivation and love for me.

专栏：我这十年来

    十年和五十年
    周信芳
    从七岁登台算起，我的舞台生活已经将近六十年了。可是真正认识到舞台生活的意义，领略到舞台生活的乐趣，还是建国十年来的事。
    在艺术上，我从来是反对“闭关自守”的。早年，我有幸常常看到“须生泰斗”谭鑫培的表演；我长期地和前辈艺术家汪笑侬、王洪寿（老三麻子）同台演出；我对花脸刘永春的唱和花旦冯子和的创造脚色感到浓厚的兴趣……可是，解放后我才领会到：旧社会在我们艺人之间安放下多少道重重帷幕，使我们彼此隔绝，在艺术上不能交流，在感情上俨若路人。
    1952年举行全国戏曲会演，通过这次盛大的交流演出，我才恍然认识到：祖国的戏曲艺术是那么浩瀚渊博，无论是老大哥的秦腔、昆曲，无论是小弟弟小妹妹的越剧、评剧，在共产党的培养灌溉下，都没有例外地长得那么茁壮，开得那么娇艳。这使我深刻地认识到，一个良好的社会制度，对于艺术事业的发展，对艺术交流与艺术工作者的成长来说，是何等的重要。
    在党的推动和协助下，几年来我对自己常演的十几出被公认为较优秀的剧目，进行了全面的修改和整理。我与协助我进行这一工作的同志们对脚色进行了新的估价，对事件进行了新的解释，对情节进行了必要的新的安排，对唱词和宾白进行了适当的润色。经过这一番修改整理，被歪曲了的革命英雄宋江不再是一个无聊的嫖客，“杀惜”不再是妒杀或仇杀，从这一般男女关系的事件中体现出来的是革命与反革命的斗争。在“描容上路”一剧中，参考了地方戏的演出本，我把善良的老人张广才对贤德的少妇赵五娘的关怀和爱护更加人情化了，我要让这位父执辈的叮咛嘱咐倾吐出千千万万观众的心声。经过这次彻底的修改，若干脚色的精神面貌改变了，有些人物的精神品质升华了，舞台上出现了更加简洁、更加优美的新的局面。这就是党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针的体现，而离开了党的领导，这种局面是永远不可能出现的。
    1955年，当中央文化部为我和我的老友梅兰芳同志举行了“舞台生活五十年纪念”的大会和观摩演出之后，我的另一个愿望也实现了。中央为我安排了为期八个月的巡回演出，我们跑遍了东北、华北、华东五个省的十个城市，我以自己不成熟的艺术向各地求教，同时也得到了最好的机会，认真向当地各个剧种学习他们的成就和经验。1958年，我再一次得到为期六个月的巡回演出的机会，我们的足迹遍历中南、西南、西北、华北七个省的十一个城市，我们看到了更多的古老剧种的优秀艺术。
    通过在巡回演出中一连串的接触交往，使我永志难忘的第一件事是：人与人的关系彻底改变了。像现在这样路隔万重山、一见面就亲如同胞手足的现象，却是解放前我“跑码头”的时候从来没有遇见过的。人们尊称我为老艺术家，到处邀我看戏，到处邀我作报告、开座谈会，到处是热情的笑脸，到处有人要拜我为师。说也有趣，“麒派”原是江南流行的一个艺术流派，我的学生大多是江南的京剧演员，而现在远至当时驻在朝鲜的志愿军京剧团里都有了我的门弟子了。
    1956年到1957年的两个期间，我还和上海京剧院的许多同志一道访问了苏联，在莫斯科等八个城市作了访问演出。这次访苏演出，是一件使我永不能忘怀的大事。当具有高度艺术修养的苏联艺术大师和我握手言欢，以热情洋溢的语调歌颂中国戏曲艺术的巨大成就时，我内心的第一个反应就是：作为一个中国的戏曲演员，在今天，比在过去任何时候，都受到人们的尊重，因而他的责任就更大了。
    为了继承和发展遗产，为了扩大上演剧目，近年来，我一直致力于以往保留剧目的翻箱底和再估价的工作。这其中，我重新整理了“鹿台恨”、“生死板”、“斩经堂”等等的剧目，并新排了“十五贯”创作了“义责王魁”。这在剧目创作上只是很小的一个数字，我把它看成我的舞台生活又一个新阶段的开始。
    个人的水平是有限的，个人的力量是棉薄的；我决心先从自己着手，把自己的表演艺术先用文字记录下来，以供戏曲艺术理论家在进行研究工作时参考。党十分关心我的艺术生活，在党的主持下，这个艺术记录的工作已经开始了。
    说到艺术记录，我不能不联想到党对戏曲艺术各种流派的大力提倡。由于我表演上的某些特点，在长期舞台实践的过程中，不知不觉地形成了一种流派，人们叫它“麒派”。许多专家们对“麒派”正像对其他许多流派一样，作了许多精辟的研究工作。他们分析、归纳了我在表演艺术上的主要特点，并在理论上加以阐述。我们要继续发扬我们的某些优点，克服和改正我们的许多缺点。除非在共产党的领导之下，哪一个政府有心肠、有兴趣来提倡什么艺术流派！难怪苏联一位艺术同行抓紧我的手热情地说：“毛主席提倡的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，充分说明中国是一个最文明、最先进的国家。”
    十年来我的舞台生活中的另一件大事是不断地为工农兵演出，我曾几次去朝鲜战场和海防前线，挤在坑道里和站在海岸上为那里旦夕守卫着祖国门户的健儿们演出。我也曾专程去到东北最边远的基建工地，为那里鼓足干劲加速建设社会主义的重工业工人演出。我常常和同志们一道到远郊或近郊的农村去，站在绿油油的田头上，与农民共同劳动，并为他们清歌数曲，来鼓舞他们的生产热情。
    当你在广场的高台上演出，面对着正襟危坐的成万的战士，当你发现阵雨落在他们身上，他们仍旧一动不动地凝神看你的演出时，你不由得感从中来，万千种念头一齐涌上心头。这是一种什么样的观众啊！为他们演出一场戏，谁能不引为毕生的光荣和幸福！
    这十年和过去任何一个十年相比，我的舞台生活都更丰满得多；也可以说，这十年来所作的事情，无论数量上、质量上，都超过以往近五十年的总和。每一想到党和人民给我的重大的荣誉和优渥的待遇——在全国戏曲会演中颁给我荣誉奖，为我和梅兰芳同志举行“舞台生活五十年纪念”，通过各种重要的工作岗位让我参与戏曲界的领导工作，选我为全国人民代表大会代表，最近还接受我作一个光荣的共产党员，每一想到这些，我就不禁汗颜，深深感到自己责任的重大。
    好在六十几岁还不算老年，建国十年在社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业的二万五千里长征中也只是个起步。来日方长，我决心在党的领导下，在人民的监督下，矢忠矢诚，为伟大的无产阶级事业奋斗到底，来报答党和人民长期以来对我的培养和爱护。
