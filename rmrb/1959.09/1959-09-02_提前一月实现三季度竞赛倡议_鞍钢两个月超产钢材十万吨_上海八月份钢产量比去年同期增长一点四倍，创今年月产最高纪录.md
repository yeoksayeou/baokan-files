Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 1st: The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's thirteen rolling mills, after heroic struggle, have realized the initiative to increase steel production by 100,000 tons in the third quarter, one month and one day ahead of schedule.

    After setting a high production record in July, the workers of these thirteen rolling mills jointly issued an initiative to rolling mills across the country on August 4th to increase steel production by 100,000 tons in the third quarter. After putting forward the initiative, they carried out in-depth socialist labor competitions and actively innovated technologies and learned advanced experiences. Leading cadres of various factories also went deep into the front line of production, strengthened production leadership, and solved key production problems together with the workers. As a result, the level of production continued to improve, and they broke through planned targets almost every day. By the 26th, they had overfulfilled the August production plan. After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were transmitted to Anshan on the evening of the 26th, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers surged, and new records followed one after another, finally realizing their increased production target ahead of schedule.

    The workers of these thirteen rolling mills are currently continuing to work hard and skillfully to ensure the realization of their new increased production target of completing the annual production plan seventeen days ahead of schedule, in order to support national production and construction with more and better steel.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st: Shanghai steel workers, in the first month of grasping production in August and September, produced 163,000 tons of steel, 40,000 tons more than in July, an increase of 1.4 times compared to the same period last year, and the highest monthly steel production this year. As of August 31st, Shanggang No. 3 Plant, the largest steel producer, had overfulfilled the August state plan by more than 1,000 tons; six steelmaking workshops in Shanggang No. 6 Plant, Shanggang No. 2 Plant, and Shanghai Machine Repair General Plant also overfulfilled their steel production plans.

    The quality of the steel produced this month was also good. The qualified rate of open-hearth steel ingots in the city stabilized at 99.8%, and the first-grade product rate of steel increased every ten days. The No. 1 converter workshop of Shanggang No. 1 Plant changed the acidic converter to an alkaline converter, improving the quality of the steel. The qualified rate of steel was 90% in May, and has been stable at between 95% and 96% from June to August. In August, the proportion of first-grade products in the qualified steel produced by Shanggang No. 6 Plant increased by 22% compared to July.

    The reason why the Shanghai steel front was able to achieve such brilliant achievements in August is mainly because the combat call issued by the Party Central Committee powerfully armed the 100,000 steel fighters in Shanghai ideologically. After the People's Daily issued the editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy" in early August, various steel plants checked the completion of production plans and convened "Leap Forward Mobilization Rallies," giving the labor competition and increased production and economy movement a new look. After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the increased production and economy movement in various factories reached a new climax. From August 27th to 31st, the average daily output of steel in the city reached more than 6,500 tons, an increase of 25% compared to the average daily output from the 1st to the 26th.

    The production plans for these steel plants and workshops in Shanghai in August were relatively advanced, requiring great effort to achieve. In order to complete and overfulfill the state plan, the workers of various steel plants, focusing on the goals of high yield, high quality, and low cost, tapped the potential of equipment and improved the level of steelmaking operations. Converter workers further took measures to extend the life of the converters, extending the life of each furnace from nearly 40 heats in July to more than 40 heats, ensuring that there were enough furnaces in the workshop for steelmaking. At the same time, they strictly implemented the pre-furnace operating procedures and eliminated the creation of the third slag, which generally shortened the smelting time of each heat of steel by two or three minutes. For example, the No. 1 converter workshop of Shanggang No. 3 Plant, in August, made full use of equipment capacity, frequently maintained three converters blowing, achieving more than 100 heats per day and producing more than 800 tons of steel, not only overfulfilling the monthly state plan, but also reaching a higher level of equipment utilization coefficient of more than 32 tons per day. In open-hearth and electric furnaces, workers universally adopted methods such as expanding the furnace charge, speeding up the charging speed, and strictly controlling the furnace temperature to further increase the daily output of steel. For example, the workers of the No. 2 electric furnace of Shanghai Machine Repair General Plant, in August, adopted the advanced experience of oxygen blowing during the reduction period of Dalian Steel Plant, while expanding the output of the transformer and shortening the charging time, reducing the smelting time from 130 minutes to more than 110 minutes, and the utilization coefficient thus rose from an average of 42.4 tons in July to an average of 44.3 tons in August, setting a new record and completing the state plan for the month two days ahead of schedule.

### 提前一月实现三季度竞赛倡议  鞍钢两个月超产钢材十万吨  上海八月份钢产量比去年同期增长一点四倍，创今年月产最高纪录

    提前一月实现三季度竞赛倡议
    鞍钢两个月超产钢材十万吨
    上海八月份钢产量比去年同期增长一点四倍，创今年月产最高纪录
    新华社鞍山1日电　鞍钢十三个轧钢厂职工经过英勇奋战，已经提前一个月零一天实现了在第三季度增产十万吨钢材的倡议。
    这十三个轧钢厂职工在7月份创造了高产纪录之后，8月4日联合向全国轧钢厂发出了在第三季度增产十万吨钢材的倡议。他们在提出倡议以后，深入地开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，并且积极革新技术和学习先进经验。各厂的领导干部，也纷纷深入生产第一线，加强生产领导，同工人一起解决生产关键问题。因此，生产水平不断提高，几乎天天都突破计划指标。到26日止，他们就超额完成了8月份生产计划。26日晚上，党的八中全会公报和决议传到鞍山之后，广大职工生产热情激增，新纪录一个接着一个，终于提前实现了他们的增产指标。
    这十三个轧钢厂的职工，目前正在继续大干巧干，保证实现他们最近提出的提前十七天完成全年生产计划的新的增产指标，以更多更好的钢材支援国家生产和建设。
    新华社上海1日电　上海钢铁工人在抓8、9月份生产的第一个月中，产钢十六万三千吨，比7月份多四万吨，比去年同期增长一点四倍，是今年以来钢产量最高的一个月。到8月31日止，钢产量最大的上钢三厂已超额一千多吨完成了8月份的国家计划；上钢六厂、上钢二厂和上海机修总厂等五个厂的六个炼钢车间也都超额完成了产钢计划。
    这个月炼出的钢质量也好。全市平炉钢锭合格率稳定在99.8％，钢的一级品率逐旬提高。上钢一厂的第一转炉车间将酸性转炉改为碱性转炉，提高了钢的质量，5月份钢的合格率为90％，6月份到8月份一直稳定在95％到96％之间。上钢六厂8月份生产的合格钢中，一级品比7月份增加22％。
    8月份，上海钢铁战线所以能够取得如此辉煌的成就，主要是党中央发出的战斗号召，在思想上有力地武装了上海十万钢铁战士。8月初，人民日报发出“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”社论后，各钢铁厂检查了生产计划的完成情况，召开了“跃进誓师大会”，使劳动竞赛和增产节约运动出现新的面貌。党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，各厂的增产节约运动更达到了新的高潮。从8月27日到31日五天内，全市钢的平均日产量达到了六千五百多吨，比1日到26日的平均日产量增长了25％。
    上海市这几个钢厂和车间8月份的生产计划都订的比较先进，需要花很大的努力才能达到。各钢铁厂的职工为了完成和超额完成国家计划，围绕着高产、优质、低成本的目标，挖掘设备潜力，提高炼钢操作水平。转炉工人们进一步采取措施，延长转炉炉龄，使每一个炉子的炉龄从7月份的近四十炉延长到四十多炉，保证车间里有足够的炉子炼钢。同时，严格执行炉前操作规程，消灭造第三次渣，使每炉钢的冶炼时间普遍缩短了二、三分钟。如上钢三厂第一转炉车间，8月份充分发挥设备能力，经常保持三只转炉吹炼，达到日炼一百多炉，产钢八百多吨，不仅超额完成了全月国家计划，而且转炉设备的利用系数达到了日产三十二吨多的更高水平。在平炉、电炉方面，工人们普遍采用了扩大装炉量、加快进料速度和严格控制炉温等办法，进一步提高钢的日产量。如上海机修总厂二号电炉职工，8月份采用大连钢厂还原期吹氧的先进经验，同时扩大变压器输出量、缩短进料时间，使熔炼时间由一百三十分钟缩短到一百一十多分钟，利用系数因此从7月份平均四二·四吨上升到8月份平均四四·三吨，创造了最新纪录，提前两天完成了这个月的国家计划。
