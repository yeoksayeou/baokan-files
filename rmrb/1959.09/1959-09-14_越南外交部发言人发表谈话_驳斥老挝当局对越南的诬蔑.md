Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 12th: A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement to reporters here today, refuting the continued crude slanders against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by the authorities of the Lao Phoui Sananikone government. The spokesman said that this is the fifteenth time the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has refuted the slanderous arguments of the Lao authorities.

The spokesman pointed out that the Lao government recently issued a communique stating that "seven hundred North Vietnamese troops and two hundred pro-communist rebels from the Lao Combat Units are intensifying their encirclement of the Sang De stronghold in the southeast of Sam Neua province." He said that this news is completely fabricated.

The spokesman pointed out that the Lao authorities' slanderous arguments are self-contradictory. Lao Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya once told Parisian reporters at Orly Airport that "the situation in Laos is extremely serious" and that "United Nations observers will not find it difficult to see North Vietnam's intervention in Laos."

However, when reporters questioned him about the contradictory Lao war reports, Panya frantically blurted out, "Although the news released is contradictory, it is certain that Viet Minh has intervened in Laos."

According to a Saigon radio report on September 12, acting Lao Foreign Minister Sisouk Na Champassak declared to reporters in Vientiane that the situation in Laos had calmed down, possibly because of the imminent arrival of United Nations observers.

The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam continued, saying that the self-contradictory remarks made by the Lao Foreign Minister and Acting Minister alone sufficiently prove that the Lao authorities' arguments are complete fabrications.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 13th: Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, sent a telegram to the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council on the 12th, requesting the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to help the Asian-African people understand the truth about the situation in Laos, so as to strive for the realization of the resolutions of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in order to safeguard peace and national independence in Asian and African countries.

The telegram said that the slanders made by the Phoui Sananikone government against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the United Nations are completely fabricated, and the resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council is illegal, violating the Geneva Accords and creating more conditions for the intervention of American imperialism and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military aggression bloc in Laos.

The telegram pointed out that in order to solve the Lao problem, the intervention of American imperialism in Laos must be stopped, the Geneva Accords on Laos and the Vientiane Agreement signed between the Lao Kingdom Government and the Lao Combat Units must be respected, and the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos must be restored.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 12th: According to the first issue of "Patriotic News of Laos" published on September 8, many soldiers who defected from the Phoui Sananikone government army recently wrote letters to the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, accusing the Sananikone government of mistreating them.

A soldier named Tao Seng from the 116th Company of the Sananikone government army said in a letter written on August 10, "On May 11, 1958, the Phoui Sananikone government army unreasonably surrounded my home, tied me up, and imprisoned me in Phong Saly prison, and then forced me to join the army. A lieutenant named Tao La forced me to do hard labor and beat me cruelly, sometimes until I fainted. Before my injuries were healed, I was forced to participate in 'sweeping'."

Tao Seng said, "I can no longer endure the mistreatment of the Sananikone government army, and I am unwilling to be cannon fodder for American imperialism and its lackeys, so I escaped."

Seven defected soldiers from the 4th Company of the 21st Battalion of the Sananikone government army said in a letter to the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on September 3, "We are very happy to be able to return to the ranks of the people. We warmly welcome the correct and reasonable policies of the Lao Patriotic Front. We demand that the Sananikone government immediately stop the civil war and earnestly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreement." The letter also said, "We call on our brothers in the Sananikone government army to oppose the 'sweeping' orders and leave the Sananikone government army as soon as possible and return to their homes, and not to be cannon fodder for American imperialism and the Sananikone clique."

    越南外交部发言人发表谈话
    驳斥老挝当局对越南的诬蔑
    新华社河内12日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天对这里记者发表谈话，驳斥老挝培·萨纳尼空政府当局对越南民主共和国继续进行的粗暴诬蔑。发言人说，这是越南民主共和国第十五次驳斥老挝当局的诬蔑论调。
    发言人指出，老挝政府最近发表公报说，“七百名北越军队和二百名寮国战斗部队中的亲共叛乱分子正在加紧包围桑怒省东南部的桑德据点”。他说，这消息完全是捏造的。
    发言人指出，老挝当局的诬蔑论调是自相矛盾的。老挝外交大臣坎番·班雅在澳尔里机场上曾经向巴黎记者说，“老挝局势极为严重”，“联合国的观察员将不难看到北越对老挝的干涉”。
    但是，当记者就自相矛盾的老挝的战报向他提出质问的时候，班雅又慌乱地胡说，“发表的消息虽有矛盾，但是，可以肯定，越盟曾经干涉老挝”。
    另据西贡电台9月12日报道，老挝外交代理大臣西苏·纳占巴萨却曾经向万象记者宣称，老挝局势已经平静，这可能是联合国观察员即将到来的原故。
    越南民主共和国外交部发言人接着说，仅是老挝外交大臣和代理大臣之间，就有这样自相矛盾的言论，这种矛盾就充分证明了老挝当局的论调是彻头彻尾的诬蔑。
    新华社河内13日电　越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席阮春水在12日打电报给亚非人民团结理事会书记处，要求亚非人民团结理事会设法使亚非人民了解老挝局势的真相，从而为实现亚非人民团结大会的决议而奋斗，以维护亚非各国的和平和民族独立。
    电报说，培·萨纳尼空政府在联合国对越南民主共和国的诬蔑完全是捏造，而联合国安全理事会通过的决议是非法的，它违反了日内瓦协议，为美帝国主义和东南亚条约军事侵略集团干涉老挝创造了更多的条件。
    电报指出，为了解决老挝问题，必须停止美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队签订的万象协议必须得到尊重，必须恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。
    新华社河内12日电　据9月8日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”第一期报道，最近有许多培·萨纳尼空政府军队的投诚士兵写信给老挝爱国战线党中央委员会，控诉萨纳尼空政府对他们的虐待行为。
    萨纳尼空政府军队第一一六连一个名叫陶生的士兵在8月10日写的信中说，“1958年5月11日，培·萨纳尼空政府军队无理包围我的家，把我捆起来，关进丰沙里的监狱里，然后强迫我当兵。一个名叫陶拉的中尉强迫我去做苦役，残酷地打我，有时打得我昏过去。我的伤还没有治好，就又强迫我去参加‘扫荡’。”
    陶生说，“我不能再忍受萨纳尼空政府军队的虐待，不甘心充当美帝国主义及其走狗的炮灰，因此我逃了出来”。
    萨纳尼空政府军队第二十一营第四连的七名投诚的士兵，在9月3日写给老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的一封信中说，“我们很高兴能够回到人民的队伍里。我们热烈欢迎老挝爱国战线党的正确的、合情合理的政策。我们要求萨纳尼空政府立即停止内战，严正履行日内瓦协议和万象协议”。信中还说，“我们呼吁在萨纳尼空政府军队里的兄弟们，反对‘扫荡’的命令，并且早日离开萨纳尼空政府军，回到自己的家里，不要充当美帝国主义和萨纳尼空集团的炮灰。”
