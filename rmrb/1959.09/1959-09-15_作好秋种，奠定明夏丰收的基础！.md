Do a Good Job of Autumn Planting to Lay the Foundation for a Bumper Summer Harvest Next Year!

The call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has quickly turned into a powerful action by the masses. In the vast rural people's communes, the production upsurge is rising day by day. After successive major victories in the struggle against disasters, the majority of farmers are advancing in two directions: one large force is launching a final battle to complete and overfulfill the 1959 production tasks; the other large force is paving the way for a greater summer harvest in 1960. This newspaper has already published a commentary on the autumn harvest work on September 8; now, let's talk about some things that should be paid attention to in the autumn planting.

The late rice in the south and the early autumn grain crops in the north have already been harvested, and the land has been freed up. The twenty-odd days from now until the late autumn maturity are the most precious and must be seized. The most important task at present is to earnestly grasp the preparation work for autumn planting, including implementing the planting plan to the production team and arranging it to each piece of land; implementing the contracted output, contracted labor, and contracted cost according to the land plot; and formulating practical measures to increase production, such as how much deep plowing, how much fertilization, and how to improve sandy, alkaline, and thin land, etc. The people's communes should promptly do a good job of these preparatory work, lead and help the production teams to do the autumn planting work more, faster, better, and more economically.

Whether or not the autumn planting work can be done more, faster, better, and more economically is essentially a question of whether or not to continue to bravely leap forward on the basis of the great victories of last year and this year. The current situation on the entire economic front is very favorable. The anti-rightist and encouragement of enthusiasm have had significant effects. Industrial production is making comprehensive progress. In agriculture, after the great summer harvest, good news of the early autumn harvest is also constantly coming; judging from the crops currently growing, a bumper autumn harvest is also promising. When we are carrying out autumn planting work, we must foresee the situation of continued leap forward next year and actively and proactively adapt the autumn planting work to the requirements of the development of the situation. The autumn planting area in our country generally accounts for about one-fifth to one-quarter of the annual planting area, and in some places it even exceeds one-third. Therefore, doing a good job of autumn planting and striving for a bumper summer grain harvest next year will play a great role in ensuring and promoting the victorious progress of agricultural production and the entire economic front next year. Summer grain has a wide range of uses. Wheat is one of the main food grains for people in the northern region, and the grain used for non-staple foods (pastries) and the summer rations in the rice-growing areas in the south are also mainly solved by it. Rapeseed is a major source of edible vegetable oil, and oil cake is an important fertilizer for crops. In the southern region, some grass seeds (purple alfalfa, etc.) are also sown in autumn. This is a high-yielding, low-labor, and high-fertility green manure crop, which is a very good base fertilizer for spring-sown crops. Therefore, doing a good job of autumn planting can not only meet the consumption needs of the broad masses of people, but also powerfully support the country's economic construction, and can also provide favorable conditions for striving for a bumper harvest throughout the year next year. How to do a good job of autumn planting?

First, plant more and plant enough. Resolutely completing the sowing area stipulated in the national plan is the primary condition for ensuring increased summer grain production next year. There must be a certain area to have the conditions to strive for more harvest. Under the encouragement of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, many places have already formulated plans to expand the autumn planting area. At the same time, all localities are also actively preparing material resources such as seeds, fertilizers, and tools, which creates extremely favorable conditions for striving for increased summer production next year. Of course, all localities must make overall plans and rational arrangements based on the possible conditions in their localities when expanding the autumn planting area. While ensuring an increase in the total output for the year, strive to plant more wheat and other summer-harvested crops.

Second, plant quickly and plant well. "Wheat is rich in the womb, and planting well accounts for three-tenths of the harvest." Compared with other crops, the quality of wheat planting has a particularly significant impact on yield. The so-called planting well means timely sowing, and can be appropriately advanced. One is to deeply plow and finely harrow, apply sufficient base fertilizer, select good varieties, and plant reasonably densely during the sowing stage. As long as the conditions of soil, fertilizer, water, and seeds are fully prepared, and then sowing can be carried out in a timely manner, it is possible to strive for the formation of the vast majority of tillers before winter, and after the spring, early jointing and early ear formation can not only strive for more and larger ears, but also make the culms strong and sturdy, enhancing the performance of lodging resistance and disease prevention. In the past, some places often had low-yield fields and abandoned areas due to untimely sowing or other conditions not keeping up, which affected the improvement of total output. Some places have had 20% to 30% of the third-class seedlings over the years. The yield per mu of first-class seedlings is as high as five or six hundred jin, while the yield per mu of some third-class seedlings is only one hundred jin or dozens of jin. If it is possible to sow in a timely manner and earnestly implement the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture, plant all the wheat well, ensure balanced production increase, and raise the third-class seedlings to first-class and second-class seedlings, the total output can be increased by one or two tenths or even more. Some people believe that the third-class seedlings, low-yield fields, etc., are mainly due to poor objective conditions, such as poor soil quality and poor water conservancy conditions, which make it impossible to increase production. Of course, it is somewhat difficult to increase production in these lands with poor conditions; however, as long as you muster enough energy, strive for the upstream, put in more effort, put in more work, create favorable conditions, change unfavorable situations, and increase production, it is still possible. Moreover, the greater the potential for increasing production in low-yield areas, the faster the effect of putting in effort. The 10,000 mu of dryland wheat fields in Yuzhuang Commune, Linfen County, Shanxi Province, were once considered to be barren land on the plateau, and the yield could not be increased. The yield per mu has always been around 100 jin. However, during the great leap forward last year, the commune members deeply plowed this low-yield field and applied more base fertilizer. At the same time, they organized a professional team to strengthen management responsibly from beginning to end. As a result, the yield per mu increased to 401 jin at once this year. Facts have proved that as long as the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" is earnestly implemented, there is no land that cannot increase production at all.

Is the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" really good? Some people with right-leaning conservative ideas, seeing some shortcomings or individual failures in the experimental process in individual places and individual plots due to lack of experience, exaggerate them, saying that the "Eight-Character Charter" is not good, or that deep plowing and dense planting are not good. This is like saying that eating is not good because someone occasionally chokes on a bite. Fully implementing the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" is a revolutionary measure in agricultural technology. Nothing can be done perfectly all at once. How can such a major revolution be done perfectly on every piece of land all at once? For the sake of a greater harvest next year, for the continuous rise of agricultural production, it is necessary to resolutely implement the "Eight-Character Charter," defend the "Eight-Character Charter," and conduct a serious struggle of reasoning against any right-leaning ideas that attempt to shake this fundamental law of agricultural production. It is necessary to present facts and reason things out. Therefore, all localities must combine the preparatory work for autumn planting, earnestly summarize the experience of increasing production in summer and autumn, and use concrete facts of high yield to prove the truth of the "Eight-Character Charter"; at the same time, find out specific measures for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" according to local conditions and crops. When Fenggezhuang Brigade of Fenggezhuang Commune in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, was formulating the wheat sowing plan, people with right-leaning conservative ideas insisted on opposing deep plowing and dense planting and advocated using the old methods for sowing. The brigade party branch then mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of high wheat yield, proving that under the same soil quality and the same cultivation conditions, deep plowing of more than seven inches yields about 20% more than plowing of four or five inches deep; sowing 21.5 jin per mu yields more than twice as much as sowing 10 jin; applying 5,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu yields about 30% more than applying only 300 jin of base fertilizer; selecting good varieties increases yield by about 20% compared to the past inferior varieties. These vivid facts are the most convincing. It has a great effect on enhancing the masses' confidence in reforming technology and eliminating right-leaning conservative ideas. After this brigade summarized in this way, the thinking was unified, the understanding was consistent, and specific measures for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" in autumn planting were formulated, and they are now actively preparing for autumn planting.

Mobilizing the masses to conduct extensive discussions can not only eliminate ideological obstacles, but also combine the "Eight-Character Charter" with the specific situation of the locality and determine specific requirements according to the specific situation of each place. When Xixiaochao Management District of Shuitou Commune in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, was discussing dense planting, some people said: One wheat plant has nine heads, why plant more seeds? As long as the land has strength, it is enough to sow 10 jin per mu. Some people, seeing the bumper harvest of dense planting this year, advocated that sowing at least no less than 30 jin per mu. Later, after joint discussions between cadres and the masses, a specific analysis was made for each piece of land. And combined with various conditions to study, the more than 12,000 mu of wheat fields in the entire management area were divided into two categories and seven grades. The sowing amount varied from 15 jin to 32 jin. Everyone was satisfied and said: This is the real "adapting to local conditions and reasonable dense planting"!

It is necessary to plant enough, but also plant well; it is necessary to be timely, but also earnestly implement the "Eight-Character Charter." This will have some difficulties in terms of labor and animal power. However, as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen leadership, and give full play to the superiority of the people's commune, and organically combine the various tasks, the difficulties can be solved. There are many favorable conditions this year. The light of the Eighth Plenary Session has illuminated the road forward, the general line has been more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the people's communes are healthier and more consolidated, the masses are full of spirit and full of energy; the experience of implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" is becoming increasingly rich. As long as the party committees in all localities seize the opportunity, make good preparations, and make full use of the favorable conditions, they will definitely be able to complete the autumn planting tasks more, faster, better, and more economically.

### 作好秋种，奠定明夏丰收的基础！

    作好秋种，奠定明夏丰收的基础！
    党的八届八中全会的号召迅速地变成了群众的有力的行动，在广大农村人民公社里，生产高潮一天比一天高涨。在抗灾斗争连续取得重大胜利以后，大部地区农民群众正分兵两路乘胜前进：一路大军在为完成和超额完成1959年的各项生产任务而展开最后一场决战；另一路大军在为夺取1960年夏季的更大丰收开辟道路。关于秋收工作，本报已在9月8日发表了一篇评论；现在，再来谈谈秋种方面应该注意的一些事情。
    现在南方的中稻和北方的早秋粮食作物已经收了，地已经腾出来了。从现在到晚秋成熟这二十多天时间是最宝贵的，必须抓紧。当前最重要的工作是切实抓紧作好秋种的各项准备工作，包括把种植计划落实到生产小队，安排到每一块地；按地块把包产、包工、包成本落实；还要订出切实的增产措施，如深耕多少、施肥多少、沙、碱薄地如何改良，等等。人民公社应及时作好这些准备工作，领导和帮助生产队把秋种工作做得更多更快更好更省。
    能不能把秋种工作做得更多更快更好更省，这实质上是要不要在去年和今年的伟大胜利的基础上继续奋勇跃进的问题。当前整个经济战线的形势是十分有利的。反右倾、鼓干劲已经发生了显著的效果。工业生产正在全面挺进。农业方面，在夏季大丰收之后，早秋丰收的捷报也不断传来；就正在生长的作物看，秋季丰收也大有希望。我们在进行秋种工作的时候，一定要预见到明年继续跃进的形势，主动地积极地使秋种工作适应形势发展的要求。我国秋种面积一般都占全年播种面积的五分之一到四分之一左右，有些地方甚至超过三分之一以上，因此，做好秋种工作，争取明年夏粮丰收，对保证和促进明年的农业生产以至整个经济战线的胜利进展都有很大的作用。夏粮用途很广，小麦是北方地区人们的主要食粮之一，副食品（糕点）用粮和南方水稻地区的夏季口粮，也主要靠它来解决。油菜是食用植物油的主要来源的一部分，油枯更是农作物的重要肥料。在南方地区秋季还播种一些草子（紫云英等），这是一种产量高、花工少、肥力大的绿肥作物，是春播作物的很好的一种基肥。因此，做好秋种工作不仅可以满足广大人民的消费需要，而且可以有力地支援国家经济建设，也可以为争取明年全年丰收提供有利条件。怎样做好秋种工作呢？
    第一，要多种、种足。坚决完成国家计划规定的播种面积是保证明年夏粮增产的首要条件。必须有一定的面积，才有条件争取多收。在八中全会决议的鼓舞下，很多地方都已订出了扩大秋种面积的计划。同时各地也都在积极进行种子、肥料、工具等物质资料的准备工作，这为争取明年夏季增产创造了极为有利的条件。当然，各地在扩大秋种面积时必须根据当地的可能条件通盘筹划，合理安排。在保证全年总产量增加的前提下，力争多种小麦及其它夏收作物。
    第二，要快种、种好。“麦子胎里富，种好三分收”。和其他作物比起来，小麦种得好坏对产量影响特别重大。所谓种好，一是及时播种，并可适当提早播种。一是在播种阶段深犁细耙、施足基肥、选用良种、合理密植。只要土、肥、水、种等条件准备充分，再能适时下种，就可以争取绝大部分分蘖在冬前形成，开春后，早拔节、早孕穗，既能争取穗多穗大，又可使秆茎坚硬粗壮，增强抗倒伏和防疫病的性能。过去有些地方由于播种不及时或者是其他条件跟不上，往往出现低产田和废弃面积，影响总产量的提高。有些地方历年都有20％到30％的三类苗。一类苗亩产高达五、六百斤，而有些三类苗亩产只有一百余斤或者几十斤。如果能够及时播种并认真贯彻执行农业八字宪法，把小麦全部种好，保证平衡增产，把三类苗提高为一、二类苗，就可以使总产量增加一两成甚至更多。有人认为三类苗、低产田等等，主要是由于客观条件差，如土质不好、水利条件不好等，无法提高产量。当然这些条件不好的土地提高产量是有些困难的；但是，只要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多出些力气，多下些工夫，创造有利条件，改变不利情况，提高产量还是可能的。而且愈是低产区，增产潜力愈大，下上工夫见效也愈快。山西临汾县邒庄公社的万亩旱地麦田，过去一直被人认为是高原瘠地，产量无法提高，亩产一直是百斤左右。但在去年大跃进高潮中，社员们对这片低产田进行了深翻，并多施了基肥，同时又组织了专业队，自始至终认真负责加强管理，结果今年亩产量一下就提高到四百零一斤。事实证明，只要认真执行农业“八字宪法”，无法提高产量的土地是根本不存在的。
    农业“八字宪法”究竟好不好？有些有右倾保守思想的人，看到个别地方、个别地块在试验的过程中因为经验不足而发生的一些缺点或个别失败的事例，就夸大起来，说是“八字宪法”不好，或者说是深耕、密植不好。这等于看到偶然有人吃噎了一口就说吃饭不好一样。全面执行农业“八字宪法”，是农业技术上的一次革命性的措施。任何事情都不是一下就能做到十全十美，这样一场大革命哪能一下子就在每块地上都做得恰到好处？为了明年的更大丰收，为了农业生产的不断上升，必须坚决地执行“八字宪法”，保卫“八字宪法”，对任何企图动摇这部农业生产的根本大法的右倾思想进行严肃的说理斗争。要摆事实，讲道理。因此，各地必须结合秋种准备工作，认真总结夏秋季增产经验，用具体的丰产事实证明“八字宪法”的真理；同时，找出因地、因作物制宜贯彻执行“八字宪法”的具体措施。山东莱阳县冯格庄公社冯格庄大队在制定小麦播种计划时，有右倾保守思想的人就坚持反对深耕密植，主张用老办法播种。大队党支部便发动群众总结小麦丰产经验，证明在同样土质同样耕作条件下，深翻七寸以上的比耕四、五寸深的多产20％左右；每亩播种二十一斤半的比播种十斤的多产一倍以上；每亩施追肥五千斤的比单施基肥三百斤的多产30％左右；选用良种比过去劣种增产20％左右。这些活生生的事实，最有说服力，它对增强群众对改革技术的信心和肃清右倾保守思想有莫大的作用。这个大队经过这样总结以后，思想统一，认识一致，订出了在秋种中贯彻执行“八字宪法”的具体措施，现在正在积极准备秋种。
    发动群众进行广泛讨论，不仅可以消除思想障碍，而且可以使“八字宪法”和当地具体情况相结合，根据各地具体情况确定具体要求。山西闻喜县水头公社西下晁管理区在讨论密植时，有人说：一麦分九头，何必多下籽？只要地有劲，每亩下种十斤就行。有的人看到今年密植丰收，就主张每亩下种至少不低于三十斤。后来经过干部和群众共同讨论，对每块地进行具体分析。并联系各种条件加以研究，把全管理区的一万二千多亩麦田分为二类七等。下种量由十五斤到三十二斤不等。大家都满意地说：这才是真正的“因地制宜，合理密植”！
    既要种足，又要种好；既要适时，又要认真执行“八字宪法”。这在劳力畜力方面是会有一些困难的。但是，只要坚持政治挂帅，加强领导，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，把各项工作有机地结合起来，困难是可以解决的。今年的有利条件是很多的，八中全会的光芒照亮了前进的道路，总路线更加深入人心，人民公社更加健全和巩固，群众精神饱满，干劲充足；执行“八字宪法”的经验日益丰富。只要各地党委抓紧时机，做好准备，充分运用有利条件，一定能够多快好省地完成秋种任务。
