Communiqué

At the invitation of Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi, former Prime Minister of Japan, visited Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, from September 9th to September 20th, 1959.

During the visit, Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi and Premier Zhou Enlai, Deputy Premier Chen Yi exchanged views frankly in a friendly atmosphere.

Both sides believe that the people of China and Japan should join hands to contribute to peace in the Far East and the world.

In order to achieve the above-mentioned goal, the people of China and Japan should, in accordance with the Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, as well as the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, strive to promote friendship between the people of China and Japan, enhance mutual trust between the two peoples, improve the existing relations between the two countries, and cooperate to restore normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that, to this end, Japan must free itself from external interference, abandon policies hostile to China, and refrain from participating in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi stated that discerning Japanese people have never tolerated such thoughts and actions in the past, and will not tolerate them in the future.

Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi stated that China and Japan should make efforts based on the actual situation for exchanges and development in political, economic, and cultural fields. Premier Zhou Enlai agreed with this, and pointed out that the development of political and economic relations between China and Japan must be combined and cannot be separated. Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi also agreed with this.

Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi stated that, in connection with the above situation, the current situation and existing international relations of Japan have unsatisfactory aspects, and that the greatest efforts should be made to change them as soon as possible and gradually realize them. Premier Zhou Enlai welcomed this, and pointed out that we are willing to see the Japanese people realize the above-mentioned wishes as soon as possible, and the Chinese people will vigorously support the efforts made by the Japanese people to achieve this goal, and sincerely sympathize with the Japanese people's wishes for independence, freedom, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi suggested that politicians and people from all walks of life in China and Japan should increase contact and frankly exchange views in order to enhance mutual understanding and friendship.

Premier Zhou Enlai stated that Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi's visit is beneficial to enhancing mutual understanding. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will, as in the past, welcome Japanese politicians and people from all walks of life who are sincere in their friendship with China to visit China.

    公报
    日本前任首相石桥湛山先生应中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来的邀请，于1959年9月9日到9月20日访问了中华人民共和国首都北京。
    在访问期间，石桥湛山先生同周恩来总理、陈毅副总理在友好气氛中，坦率地交换了意见。
    双方认为，中日两国人民应该携起手来，为远东和世界和平作出贡献。
    为着实现上述目的，中日两国人民应该根据互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则，努力促进中日两国人民的友好，增强两国人民相互间的信任，改善两国的现存关系，并且为早日恢复两国的正常关系而进行合作。
    周恩来总理指出，为此，日本必须摆脱外来干涉，排除敌视中国政策和不参加制造“两个中国”的阴谋，石桥湛山先生对此表示，有见识的日本人士过去未曾容忍这种思想和行动，今后也是不能容忍的。
    石桥湛山先生表示，中日两国为了在政治、经济和文化方面的交流和发展，应该根据实际情况进行努力。周恩来总理对此表示同意，并指出中日两国政治和经济关系的发展必须结合起来，不能予以分割。对此，石桥湛山先生也表示同意。
    石桥湛山先生表示，关联到上述情况，日本的现状和现存的国际关系，有不能令人满意之处，应该尽最大努力，早日加以改变，并且逐步促其实现。周恩来总理对此表示欢迎，并且指出，我们愿意看到日本人民能够早日实现上述愿望，中国人民将大力支持日本人民为实现这一目标而作的努力，衷心同情日本人民关于独立、自由、民主、和平、中立的愿望。
    石桥湛山先生建议，中日两国的政治家和各界人士应该增加接触，坦率地交换意见，以增进彼此的了解和友好。
    周恩来总理表示，石桥湛山先生的来访，对增进相互了解是有益的。中国政府和中国人民将和过去一样，欢迎对中日友好抱有诚意的日本政治家和各界人士前来中国访问。
