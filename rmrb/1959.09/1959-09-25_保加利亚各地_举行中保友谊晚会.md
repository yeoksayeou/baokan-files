    新华社索非亚24日电　保加利亚人民正在开展庆祝中国建国十周年的各种活动。从9月17日以来，保加利亚已经有七个州，十一个城市和村庄先后举行了中保友谊晚会。
    这些晚会都是由当地的祖国阵线组织主办的。
    中国驻保加利亚大使馆人员应邀出席了这些晚会，并且受到了当地居民的热烈欢迎。
    当地的党政负责人都出席了晚会，并在讲话中赞扬了中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就。
    洛维契州卢科维特市人民会议主席尼诺夫在这个城市的读书室举行的庆祝晚会上说，我们怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情，注视着兄弟的中国人民在争取社会主义和共产主义的幸福生活中所取得的惊人的成就。他说，中国的人民公社是根据马列主义原则建立起来的，它是符合于中国条件的，是中国人民向共产主义迈进的最好形式。中国人民公社将作为中国共产党和中国人民的伟大发现和非常宝贵的贡献载入国际工人和共产主义运动的理论中去。
