Timely Harvesting, Every Boll to the Granary
This year, the 90,000 mu of cotton in the Qiliying Commune of Xinxiang, Henan, grew exceptionally well. Although there were sixty days of drought without rain, the harvest surpassed previous years. White color, long fibers, and high ginning ratio are the characteristics of this year's cotton. Look, the newly picked cotton is piled up like mountains, making the commune members very happy.

    及时收摘　朵朵归仓
    今年，河南新乡七里营公社九万亩棉花长的特别好，虽然六十天干旱无雨，可是收成胜过往年。色白、绒长、衣分率高是今年棉花的特点。看，新摘的棉花堆成山，社员心里真喜欢。
