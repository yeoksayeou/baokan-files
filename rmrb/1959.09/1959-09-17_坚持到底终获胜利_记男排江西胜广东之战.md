Victory Through Perseverance
——Record of the Men's Volleyball Match Between Jiangxi and Guangdong

The Jiangxi Men's Volleyball Team, which defeated the People's Liberation Army Men's Volleyball Team in the first round of the volleyball finals, encountered another strong opponent, the Guangdong Men's Volleyball Team, in the third round yesterday.

The Guangdong Men's Volleyball Team boasts six Master of Sports athletes and six first-class athletes. It was the runner-up in last year's National Volleyball League A Division, and all of its members come from Taishan County, the "hometown of volleyball." During the regional preliminary round, it was the champion of the Nanchang division. The Jiangxi team was ninth in last year's League A Division and lost to the Guangdong team by a score of two to three in the preliminary round.

After the Jiangxi team served, they immediately launched an attack, forcing the Guangdong team to only defend. The Guangdong team's famous powerful serve and fierce spiking techniques could not be brought into play. Coupled with lax defense, they repeatedly missed opportunities. The first set ended with a score of four to fifteen. At the start of the second set, the Guangdong team actively counterattacked, using light dinks and powerful spikes to suppress the Jiangxi team's momentum, winning back a set with a score of fifteen to ten. In the third set, the Jiangxi team's formation was a bit chaotic, and the Guangdong team did not give the opponent a chance to breathe, attacking even more fiercely, winning another set with a score of fifteen to seven.

At the start of the fourth set, although the Jiangxi team was at a disadvantage with a score of one to two, they remained calm and composed, and seized the opportunity to counterattack, forming a back-and-forth battle. The Guangdong team once led with a score of fourteen to eleven. Just one more point would have secured their victory, but the Jiangxi team rallied and tied the score at fourteen, finally winning back the fourth set with a score of eighteen to sixteen.

The crucial fifth set arrived. After four sets of fierce battle, the audience could see that the two teams were evenly matched, with each having its own strengths. Who would win would depend on who could maintain their strong morale and composure, and who could persevere to the end. The Guangdong team wanted to take the initiative and organized a fierce attack, spiking continuously, reaching a score of four to zero. After a timeout, the Jiangxi team adopted a tactic that combined powerful spikes and light dinks, winning back two points. The Guangdong team took advantage of the momentum to attack again, reaching scores of six to two and eight to four. The Guangdong team led by four points in the first half of the set, but the Jiangxi team did not lose heart. During the change of sides, they displayed a spirit of determination and tenacity. In addition to strengthening their attack, they also paid special attention to blocking and back row defense, saving many difficult shots. Soon, the score was tied at eight. At this time, the Jiangxi players became more and more courageous, playing to their technical level. Under the opponent's counterattack, the Guangdong players lost their composure, with several instances of blocking the ball over the net and spiking the ball out of bounds. In the end, the Jiangxi team won the final set with a score of fifteen to eight.

In this match, the Jiangxi team played calmly and composed, with full of energy and persevered to the end, which was the main reason for their ability to turn defeat into victory. ·Our Reporter·

    坚持到底终获胜利
    ——记男排江西胜广东之战
    在排球决赛第一轮比赛中力挫解放军男子排球队的江西男子排球队，在昨天第三轮比赛中遇上了另一支强敌——广东男子排球队。
    广东男子排球队拥有六名运动健将和六名一级运动员，是去年全国排球甲级队联赛亚军，全部成员都来自“排球之乡”的台山县。分区预赛时，是南昌赛区的冠军。江西队是去年甲级联赛的第九名，预赛时曾以二比三败给广东队。
    江西队开球后，立即发起进攻，逼得广东队只有招架之功，广东队著名的大力发球和凶悍勇猛的扣杀技术发挥不出来，再加上防守不严，连连失机。第一局终以四比十五败下阵来。第二局开始后，广东队积极反攻，轻吊猛扣，压住了江西队的气焰，以十五比十扳回一局。第三局江西队阵势有点混乱，广东队不给对方以喘息的机会，攻势更猛，又以十五比七赢了一局。
    第四局开始后，江西队虽然处于一比二的劣势，但仍沉着应战，不慌不乱，并且伺机反攻，形成拉锯战。广东队曾以十四比十一领先，再胜一球就获胜利，但江西队一鼓作气追成十四平，最后以十八比十六终于扳回了第四局。
    关键性的第五局来了。经过四局激战，观众已经看出，这两队实力相当，技术各有所长，究竟谁胜谁负，将决定于谁能够保持旺盛的士气和沉着镇静，持到底的意志。广东队想先发制人，组织猛烈进攻，连续猛扣，打成四比零。江西队叫停后，采用猛杀和轻吊相结合的战术，扳回两分。广东队却乘胜再度进攻，又打成六比二和八比四。前半局广东队领先四分，但江西队并不气馁，易地再战中，发挥了坚决顽强的精神，除了加强进攻外，还特别注意了拦网和后排防守，抢救了许多险球。不久就打成八平。这时江西队员愈战愈勇，打出了自己的技术水平。广东队员在对方的反攻下，却沉不住气，接连几次封球过网和杀球出界。最后被江西队以十五比八，胜了最后一局。
    这场球，江西队打得沉着镇定，干劲十足，坚持到底，这是能够转败为胜的主要原因。  ·本报记者·
