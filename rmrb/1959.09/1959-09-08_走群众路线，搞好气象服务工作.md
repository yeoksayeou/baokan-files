Adhere to the Mass Line, Improve Meteorological Services

Lu Wu, Standing Director of the Chinese Meteorological Society

As a meteorological worker in the new China, I firmly respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and actively devote myself to the movement of opposing rightism, boosting morale, increasing production and practicing economy. I want to thoroughly examine and criticize right-leaning and slackening sentiments. While learning, I will take action, and together with the national meteorological staff, under the leadership of the Party, follow the mass line, ensure the over-fulfillment and proper completion of various work tasks, and push meteorological services to a new high tide, so that meteorological work truly becomes a weapon for Party committees and governments at all levels and production departments to fight against natural disasters.

In 1958 and the first half of 1959, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism and driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the people's commune movement, we relied on Party committees at all levels to carry out a mass movement in meteorological work. This brought about a vigorous new situation in national meteorological work, and began to find a path to build a socialist meteorological undertaking with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In less than a year, we achieved the goal of having stations in every province and special district, stations in every county, sentry posts in every commune, and weather observation groups in every team, basically establishing a national meteorological service network. At the same time, through the meteorological service network, we also extensively carried out supplementary forecasting and agricultural meteorological work, improving the accuracy rate of local weather forecasts by about 10%, effectively ensuring the needs of agricultural bumper harvests and the production of other national economic sectors. Such achievements are unprecedented and have never happened in the history of our country. This is due to the initial implementation of the policy of combining professional stations with civilian-run sentry posts, combining large, medium, and small forecasting services, and combining modern science with mass experience in the meteorological department. This fact also proves the greatness, correctness, and infinite power of the Party's general line for building socialism. All our undertakings, as long as we are under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely follow the mass line, and launch a vigorous mass movement, we can leap forward again and again, and go from one victory to another.

I firmly believe that through opposing rightism, boosting morale, and carrying out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, all kinds of right-leaning and slackening sentiments will be completely eliminated, and a new high tide of greater leap forward will emerge in our socialist construction cause.

    走群众路线，搞好气象服务工作
    中国气象学会常务理事　卢鋈
    作为新中国的一个气象工作者，我坚决响应中共八届八中全会的伟大号召，积极投入反右倾、鼓干劲的增产节约运动中去。我要彻底检查和批判右倾松劲情绪，边学习，边行动，和全国气象工作人员一道，在党的领导下，走好群众路线，保证超额完成和做好各项工作任务，把气象服务工作，推向一个新的高潮，使气象工作真正成为各级党政和生产部门的自然灾害作斗争的武器。
    在1958年和1959年上半年，我们在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进和人民公社运动的带动下，依靠各级党委，开展了气象工作群众化运动。这使全国气象工作出现了一个轰轰烈烈的新局面，开始找到了一条建设社会主义气象事业多快好省的道路。仅仅在不到一年的时间里，就实现了省、专区有台，县县有站，社社有哨，队队有看天小组，基本上建成了全国的气象服务网。与此同时，还通过了气象服务网，广泛开展了补充预报和农业气象工作，把地方天气预报的准确率提高了10％左右，有力地保证了农业的丰产丰收和其他国民经济部门的生产需要。这样的成就是空前的，是我国历史上从来没有过的。这是由于在气象部门初步贯彻了专业台站与民办哨组相结合，预报服务大中小相结合和现代科学与群众经验相结合的方针而取得的。这一事实也证明了党的建设社会主义总路线的伟大、正确和无穷无尽的力量。我们一切的事业，只要在党和毛主席的英明领导下，坚决走群众路线，掀起声势浩大的群众运动，就能跃进再跃进，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    我坚信，通过反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动，将会彻底消灭形形色色的右倾松劲情绪，使我们的社会主义建设事业出现一个更大跃进的高潮。
