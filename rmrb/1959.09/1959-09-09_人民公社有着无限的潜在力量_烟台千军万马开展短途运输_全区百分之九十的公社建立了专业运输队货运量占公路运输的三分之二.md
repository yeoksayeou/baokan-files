(Jinan, September 8th) The Yantai Special Zone in Shandong Province, while ensuring the transportation tools and labor force needed for agricultural production, is actively taking effective measures to support and promote the development of short-distance transportation. Currently, among the 181 people's communes in the region, except for a few with too few vehicles and small transportation volumes, 165 people's communes have established professional transportation teams, basically forming a relatively complete short-distance transportation network. This plays a significant role in ensuring the smooth exchange of materials needed for industrial and agricultural production, daily necessities for the people, and export goods.

The people's communes that have established professional transportation teams have organized the following transportation tools: 3,425 rubber-wheeled horse carts, 6,241 rubber-wheeled handcarts, and 392 flatbed carts. The number of people participating in professional transportation has reached more than 10,000. In addition, all communes in the region have also organized reserve transportation teams, comprising both farmers and transporters, and possessing a large number of transportation tools.

The large-scale effort in short-distance transportation in the Yantai area underwent considerable in-depth and meticulous organizational work. At the beginning of the year, some cadres and masses in the people's communes did not sufficiently recognize the importance of running transportation; at the same time, there were some negative emotions and fear of difficulties. They cited excuses such as delaying agricultural work, fearing poor management, insufficient livestock fodder, and fearing unprofitability or even losses. In response to these situations, the Yantai Prefectural Committee promptly convened meetings for special study, and at the industrial and transportation conferences of each county and city, short-distance transportation was deployed as an important task. Subsequently, the county and municipal Party committees also convened meetings of township and commune Party committee secretaries and broadcast conferences, pointing out the important significance of organizing short-distance transportation in promoting industrial and agricultural production, and explaining the policies, organizational methods, and measures to cadres and the masses in detail.

In order to develop short-distance transportation from the private sector towards fixed and enterprise-oriented operations, in addition to the personal involvement of leading cadres such as county and municipal Party committee secretaries, full-time management personnel were also assigned to provide specific assistance at the grassroots level. The Laiyang County Party Committee has assigned 23 transportation assistants, stationed in 23 communes, adopting a method of assigning areas of responsibility to organize and develop the short-distance transportation industry. Relevant departments in the county also held business training classes. The Qixia County state-owned transportation department sent a group of cadres to be stationed in various communes. In addition to helping with transportation and loading and unloading work, they also provided guidance on road maintenance techniques. People's communes generally established transportation management committees, with industrial secretaries directly leading and managing the effort. In the organizational process, two main tasks were focused on: income distribution and business management. At present, the majority of the region is organized in the form of "teams own and operate, communes manage," stipulating that transportation tools are owned by each production team, operated independently, and responsible for freight settlement and income distribution. Communes, based on the transportation tool situation, are equipped with full-time or part-time management personnel responsible for implementing the "three unifications": unified dispatch of "vehicles," unified sources of goods, and unified freight rates. The other two forms are "communes own and operate" (mostly loading and unloading teams) and "teams own, communes operate." Between teams and communes, based on the commune management system, the principle of team ownership and team revenue is implemented, except for deducting 2% for management fees and collecting relevant taxes, the rest is all owned by the production team. This distribution form is very popular with production teams. The remuneration for transportation personnel is determined through evaluations, adopting a method of more work, more pay, distribution according to work, and bonus for exceeding quotas. The transportation management committees of each commune also hold a transportation balance meeting once a month to strengthen cooperation and avoid transportation disconnection. In addition, accounts are announced on time. Furthermore, all communes attach great importance to the reform of transportation tools and organize the return of cargo to greatly unleash the potential of existing transportation tools and improve transportation efficiency.

The large-scale development of private short-distance transportation in the Yantai Special Zone has enabled the timely transportation of many materials. For example, Laiyang County externally transferred a batch of disaster relief grain this spring. Time was tight, and it was difficult to complete the task in time relying solely on automobile transportation. Because horse carts and handcarts were all mobilized, it only took seven days, two days ahead of the superior's requirements, to transport all the disaster relief grain to the railway station. At one point, the Chaoshui Commune in Penglai County had more than 1,700 tons of materials that could not be transported in time. After the professional transportation team was established, it completed all transportation tasks within a month. The commune's income has also changed. In the Yangezhuang Commune in the suburbs of Yantai City, one production team's income from five horse carts reached more than 1,900 yuan in one month.

Due to the vigorous development of short-distance transportation, the connection of various transportation tools has been greatly ensured, the burden on modern transportation tools has been reduced, and the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has been promoted. In the first half of this year, the freight volume completed by private short-distance transportation in the Yantai Special Zone accounted for about two-thirds of the total road transportation volume, and the proportion increased again in July. According to preliminary planning for the second half of this year, private short-distance transportation will account for about 70% of the total road transportation volume in the region.

    人民公社有着无限的潜在力量
    烟台千军万马开展短途运输
    全区百分之九十的公社建立了专业运输队货运量占公路运输的三分之二
    本报济南8日电　山东省烟台专区，在保证农业生产所需的运输工具和劳动力的前提下，积极采取有效措施，扶植和促进短途运输的发展。目前，在全区一百八十一个人民公社中，除少数因车辆太少和运量不大的以外，已有一百六十五个人民公社建立了专业运输队，基本上形成了较为完整的短途运输网，对保证工农业生产所需物资、人民生活需用品以及出口物资的畅通交流，起着很大的促进作用。
    这些建立了专业运输队的人民公社，已组织起来的运输工具计有：胶轮马车三千四百二十五辆，胶轮小推车六千二百四十一辆，地排车三百九十二辆。参加专业运输的人员达一万余名。此外，全区各公社还组织了拥有大量运输工具的亦农亦运的预备运输队。
    烟台地区大抓短途运输，经过了一番相当深入细致的组织工作。年初，人民公社的部分干部、群众，对办运输的重要意义认识不足；同时，存在着一些消极畏难情绪。如借口耽误农事，怕管理不好，牲畜草料不足，以及怕无利可得甚至赔钱等等。针对这些情况，烟台地委及时召开了会议，作了专门研究，并在各县、市工业交通会议上，把短途运输作为一项重要任务进行了部署。接着，各县、市委还先后召开了乡社党委书记会议和广播大会，指出组织短途运输对促进工农业生产的重要意义，并详细向干部、群众讲明政策，提出组织的办法和措施。
    为了使民间短途运输向着固定化、企业化方向发展，除各县、市委书记等领导干部亲自抓以外，并设有专职的管理人员，经常深入基层作具体帮助。莱阳县委已配备二十三名交通助理员，分驻二十三个公社，采取分片包干的办法，组织和发展短途运输业，县有关部门并举办了业务训练班。栖霞县国营运输部门派出一批干部，分驻各公社，除了帮助搞运输和装卸工作外，还指导养路技术。各人民公社也普遍成立运输管理委员会，工业书记直接进行领导和管理。在组织过程中，主要抓两项工作：收益分配和经营管理。目前，全区在组织形式上，大部分是“队有队营社管”，规定运输工具为各生产队所有，自行经营，并处理运费结算和收益分配，公社则根据运输工具情况，配备专职或兼职管理人员，负责执行三统：统一调度
  “车辆”、统一货源和统一运价。再有两种形式是“社有社营”（均系搬运装卸队）和“队有社营”。在队社之间，根据公社管理体制，执行产权属队，收入归队的原则，除扣除2％管理费和代征有关税收外，其余全部归生产队所有。这种分配形式，很受生产队欢迎。对于运输人员的报酬，是通过评比的方式，采取多劳多得、按劳分配、超额奖励的办法。各公社运输管理委员会每月还召开一次运输平衡会议，以加强协作，避免运输脱节现象；另外，还按时公布账目。此外，各公社还十分重视运输工具的改革，以及组织捎回程货，来大大发挥现有交通工具的潜力，提高运输效率。
    烟台专区大搞民间短途运输，使许多物资的运输及时了。如莱阳县今春外调一批救灾粮，时间紧迫，单靠汽车运输难以及时完成任务。由于马车、小推车都发动了起来，结果只用了七天的时间，比上级要求提前两天就把全部救灾粮运到了火车站。蓬莱县潮水公社一度曾有一千七百多吨物资不能及时运输，专业运输队建立后，一个月就全部完成运输任务。公社的收入也改观了。烟台市郊院格庄公社一个生产队，五辆马车一个月收入即达一千九百多元。
    由于短途运输的蓬勃发展，在很大程度上确保了各种交通工具在运输上的衔接，减轻了现代化交通工具的负担，促进了工农业生产的不断跃进。烟台专区在今年上半年，全区由民间短途运输完成的货运量，已占公路运输总量的三分之二左右，7月份的比重又有上升。今年下半年，据初步规划，在全区公路运输总量中，由民间短途运输担负的将占70％左右。　（高文献）（附图片）
