Mass Movements Possess Immense Power
　　Chu Xue

    Last year today, the Party put forward the great call to the people of the whole country to produce 10.7 million tons of steel for the entire year. The mass movement of large-scale steelmaking immediately surged throughout the country, with molten iron flowing everywhere and sparks flying. This magnificent mass movement ensured the leap-forward growth of steel production, drove the mass movement on the entire industrial front and the overall great leap forward in production. At the same time, "steelmaking also tempers people," enabling the broad masses to learn technology and knowledge, enabling the broad masses of cadres to gain experience, and creating conditions for the future development of the steel industry and the entire industry.... Based on the scattered "small native groups" of steel, the total volume of small blast furnaces built and put into production across the country has now reached 43,000 cubic meters, almost twice the total volume of large blast furnaces in the country. This movement is really excellent!

    "Excellent!" This is the evaluation of the broad masses of working people on the large-scale steelmaking. Right-leaning opportunists hold the opposite evaluation from the broad masses of working people, stubbornly saying that the large-scale steelmaking movement is "terrible." Their "terrible" "argument" is the so-called low quality and high cost. In the early days of starting the steel industry, due to a lack of ironmaking experience, there were indeed cases of low quality and high cost in some ironmaking bases. However, after further developing the mass movement in steel enterprises, this situation quickly changed. The power of the mass movement is immense; it can not only create brilliant achievements but also quickly eliminate local and temporary shortcomings in the course of advancement. The overall leap forward of the Taipingli Iron Factory is one example.

    The misfortune of right-leaning opportunists lies in their inability to correctly treat the revolutionary mass movement. They do not stand at the forefront of the masses to lead them, but stand behind them, criticizing them, or even standing opposite them to oppose them; they do not acknowledge that some deviations are inevitable in the mass movement, but demand that new things be perfect from the very beginning; when the mass movement encounters some twists and turns and difficulties, these people do not see it as twists and turns and difficulties in the course of advancement. They not only have no confidence in overcoming difficulties but also adopt an attitude of ridicule, mockery, and gloating. This erroneous attitude towards the mass movement has caused them to fall into the quagmire of right-leaning opportunism.

    Right-leaning opportunists seize on the temporary shortcomings of low quality and high cost in some native blast furnaces and small blast furnaces to frantically attack the large-scale steelmaking movement and use this as "capital" to further attempt to negate the Party's general line for socialist construction and the "walking on two legs" policy. However, the fact that the quality of many small blast furnaces like the Taipingli Iron Factory is continuously improving and the cost is continuously decreasing has dealt them a merciless blow. The Party's general line and the "walking on two legs" policy will forever shine with a brilliance that rivals the sun and the moon. Right-leaning opportunists have no choice but to admit defeat in the face of the facts!

    群众运动力大无穷	　楚雪
    去年今日，党向全国人民提出了全年生产一千零七十万吨钢的伟大号召。各地大炼钢铁的群众运动立即风起云涌，到处铁水奔流，钢花飞溅。这个波澜壮阔的群众运动，保证了钢铁产量的飞跃增长，带动了整个工业战线的群众运动和生产全面大跃进，同时“炼钢又炼人”，使广大群众学到了技术和知识，使广大干部取得了经验，为今后钢铁工业和整个工业的发展创造了条件……。就在星罗棋布的钢铁“小土群”的基础上，现在全国建起并开工生产的小高炉总容积已达四万三千立方米，几乎等于全国大高炉总容积的两倍。这一运动真是好得很！
    “好得很”！这是广大劳动人民对大炼钢铁的评价。右倾机会主义分子同广大劳动人民的评价相反，硬说大炼钢铁运动“糟得很”。他们的“糟”的“论据”是所谓质量低，成本高。在初办钢铁的时候，由于缺乏炼铁经验，在某些炼铁基点中确实存在质量低成本高的情况，然而在钢铁企业进一步开展群众运动以后，就迅速改变了这种状况。群众运动力大无穷，它既能创造灿烂辉煌的成绩，又能迅速扫除前进中的局部的暂时的缺点。太平里铁厂的全面跃进就是例证之一。
    右倾机会主义分子的倒霉之处，就在于不能正确地对待革命的群众运动。他们不是站在群众的前头领导他们，而是站在后头指手划脚地批评他们，甚至站在对面反对他们；他们不承认群众运动中难免出些偏差，而是要求新事物一开始就尽善尽美；当着群众运动遇到某些曲折和困难的时候，这些人不是把它看作前进中的曲折和困难，他们不但丝毫没有克服困难的信心，而且采取讥讽嘲骂、幸灾乐祸的态度。这种对待群众运动的错误态度，就使他们掉进右倾机会主义的污泥坑中去了。
    右倾机会主义分子抓住某些土高炉、小高炉质量低、成本高的暂时的缺点，疯狂攻击大炼钢铁运动，并且以此为“本钱”企图进一步否定党的社会主义建设总路线和“两条腿走路”的方针。然而许多像太平里铁厂这样的小高炉质量不断提高、成本不断降低的事实，却给他们来了一个无情的打击。党的总路线和“两条腿走路”的方针永远闪烁着同日月争辉的光彩。右倾机会主义分子只好在事实面前认输！
