Outside the Window
Zhou Libo

	One bright spring morning, I took a long-distance bus from Changsha to my hometown. The weather was still slightly chilly, but the air was exceptionally fresh. After the passengers were seated according to their numbers, the bus started on time. It ran swiftly on the red dirt road paved with gravel, and the glass windows on both sides rattled.

	I sat by the window, looking outside. Mountains of fiery red azaleas, fields of golden rapeseed flowers, along with variegated wild flowers and newly green willows, all rushed towards us and sped away behind the bus. The plowed paddy fields were filled with fertilizer pits. The shapes of the pits were varied: rectangular, round, star-shaped, and some even resembled canals, as long as the fields themselves. Some fields simply did not have pits, and the dark piles of fertilizer were as dense as drum studs.

	"Crops are like flowers, all depending on fertilizer to thrive." This slogan, written in whitewash on a smoothed old embankment, flashed past. What followed was five large characters inlaid on the roof of a house with whitewashed tiles:

	"People's Commune is Good!"

	The sun came out. The brilliant sunlight illuminated the mountain peaks, fields, and people. A large group of men were driving yellow cattle and water buffalo, plowing the fields. One plow had just passed, and another immediately followed.

	"Why are two plows plowing the same furrow?" a passenger in the bus asked. He was also looking out the window.

	"This is called tandem plowing. With tandem plowing, the field is plowed deeper," a passenger wearing a uniform cap explained.

	Teams of women were either digging field ridges or carrying sod. They had all taken off their cotton-padded jackets. Their colorful clothes, in the sunlight, set against the blue sky and green grass, looked exceptionally beautiful.

	Near the road, a thatched house had been demolished, leaving only a smoke-blackened wooden frame. Several people were carrying the blackened roof thatch and old mud bricks to nearby pits. Not far away, also close to the road, a new house of red bricks and gray tiles appeared. In front of the new house, newly planted willow branches had sprouted leaves. A large red star was molded on the gable.

	A wide new highway intersected the old road and stretched into the deep countryside. Not yet paved with gravel, the yellow mud surface already bore the chaotic traces of many rubber-wheeled carts. Five months ago, there was only a winding, overgrown, narrow path here.

	Motor vehicle convoys came and went continuously, loaded with coke, raw coal, lime, bricks, and tiles, and also live pigs. The traffic was congested, and the highway seemed too narrow. When vehicles passed each other, the drivers honked their horns incessantly. Despite the large amount of busy traffic, coal, bamboo, baskets, and various materials for agriculture, metallurgy, and construction piled up everywhere by the roadside at each station, waiting to be transported.

	The bus ran faster and faster. Ahead, a truck pulling two trailers was about to be overtaken. The driver honked the horn again and again, meaning that our bus was faster, so please give way. The truck ahead continued to wobble forward, refusing to move aside. The driver honked the horn continuously, revealing his annoyance. After driving for a while, at a wider spot, the truck finally swerved to the side. As our bus passed it, the driver suddenly braked and stuck his head out of the right window of the cab. Everyone thought a quarrel was inevitable, but unexpectedly, he said the following:

	"Hey, buddy! Something fell off in the back. You should put up your rearview mirror and check behind you." The advice had a slightly lecturing tone, but was also full of warm concern.

	That truck also braked at the same time. From the left window of the cab, the head of a slightly disheveled girl emerged, glanced at our bus, and then quickly pulled her head back in. The door opened, and she jumped down. This was a young, strong, slightly dark-skinned girl with short hair, wearing blue overalls stained with black oil.

	"Is that you, Little Wang?" The passenger in our bus wearing the uniform cap immediately stood up from his seat when he saw the female driver, stuck his head out of the window, and asked cheerfully.

	"Is that you, Comrade He?" The female driver hurried forward a few steps, intending to speak. The engine of our bus had already started.

	"You little rascal, you've become a driver! Where did your two big braids go?" Comrade He's smiling question had not yet been answered when the bus sped far away. He returned to his seat and told his neighbor that this girl was from their village. The year before, she failed the middle school entrance exam and cried at the township government. Last year, she entered a community-run middle school and was extremely happy. Soon after, the township recommended her to a car driver training class. Finally, he smiled and speculated:

	"The braids are gone, she must have thought they were in the way and cut them off."

	On the red dirt road paved with sand that undulated along the mountains, the bus continued to speed forward at an even greater speed. After crossing the Wei River Bridge and arriving at Ningxiang Station, we saw the station inside and out was full of cars. Our bus only stopped briefly and then started again.

	The bus arrived at its destination at only 9:10, earlier than the usual 11:00.

	"The bus ran really fast today," Comrade He said.

	This emerging industrial area nestled between mountains and rivers, which I had left only five months ago, had changed again. In the distance, set against the green mountains, several new chimneys and new buildings had been added. A large earthen hill next to the hospital had disappeared without a trace. Rows of red-roofed and pink-walled factory buildings of the Anhua Tea Factory occupied the original site of the hill. Turning left from the entrance of the hospital, ten or so new houses had also appeared on the south side of a newly built road. In the middle of this group of buildings, there was a white horizontal banner on the roof of one building:

	"Build Hunan's First Cardboard Factory with Soaring Enthusiasm."

	Five months ago, I met the young director of this new factory. At that time, this factory, including the factory site, was still in his pocket, that is to say, it was still only on the plan in his pocket. Now, less than half a year later, the first batch of buildings of their factory had already appeared beside the highway, in front of the bus window.

	Let us continue to leap forward with soaring enthusiasm, including all the new warriors, both the girls who cut their braids and those who did not! As long as we maintain this high speed month after month and year after year, we will surely greatly shorten the journey towards communist society.

	Let us present the spirit of moving mountains with soaring enthusiasm as a gift to our great tenth anniversary of National Day. Only such enthusiasm and spirit are extremely grand and most precious gifts.

    窗外
    周立波
    春天里的一个大清早，我搭长途车，从长沙动身，到家乡去。天气还略带寒意，空气却格外新鲜。乘客按号入座后，车子准时开动了。在铺着沙石的红土公路上，跑得飞快，两边的玻璃车窗震得呵罗呵罗响。
    我坐在窗前，了望窗外，只见一山一山火红的映山花，一丘一丘金黄的油菜花，还有杂色斑烂的草子花和新绿的柳树，都迎面而来，往车后奔逝。犁好了的水田布满了粪氹。氹子的形式是各色各样的：长方，圆眼，星式，还有一些俨像渠道，田有好长，氹子有好长。有几丘田，干脆不作氹，黑浸浸的肥料堆子密得像鼓钉子一样。
    “庄稼一朵花，全靠肥当家。”这条用石灰水写在刨光了的老墈上的标语，一闪过去了，随着映入眼里的是用涂白了的瓦片镶在一家屋上的五个大字：
    “人民公社好！”
    太阳出来了。灿烂的阳光照映着山尖、原野和人们。一大群男子赶着黄牛和水牛，正在耖田。有一张犁才走过，后面紧接着又来了一张。
    “怎么两张犁耕一条犁沟？”车里有位旅客问。他也正瞧着窗外。
    “这叫做套犁。用套犁，田翻得深些。”一位戴制帽的旅客这样地解释。
    一队队妇女，有的在刨田塍，有的在挑草皮。她们都脱了棉袄，五颜六色的花衣，在阳光里，衬着蓝的天，绿的草，显得格外地俏丽。
    公路近边，一个茅屋拆毁了，光剩一个被烟熏黑的木架子。有几个人正在把沤黑了的屋草和旧的泥砖挑到附近氹子里。不远的地方，也挨近公路，一座红砖灰瓦的新屋出现了。新屋前头，刚插的柳枝发叶了。屋端墙上塑了一颗大红星。
    一条宽敞的新的公路和旧公路交叉、往深乡伸去。还没铺沙石，黄泥路面早有许多胶皮轮盘的杂乱的痕迹。五个月以前，这里只有一条茅封草长，弯弯曲曲的羊肠路。
    汽车列车接连不断地来往，装的是焦炭、原煤、石灰和砖瓦，也有生猪。车辆拥挤，公路显得太窄了。错车时节，司机不停地拧着喇叭。尽管车子这样多而忙，但每到一站，路边到处堆起煤炭竹木?箕以及农业、冶金和建筑用的各种待运的物资。
    车越跑越快，前面有辆拖着两个斗子的卡车看看被我们赶上。司机一次又一次地拧喇叭，意思是说，我们车快些，请你让让路。前面的车子还是摇摇摆摆，不停不息往前跑，不肯躲开。司机连续不断地拧喇叭，可以听出是发脾气了。又走了一段，到了个宽阔的地方，前车才歪到一边，我们的车子错过去，和它品排时，忽然煞住车，司机把头伸到驾驶室的右边的窗外，人都以为定要吵架了，不料他说出来的是下边的话：
    “喂老兄！后边掉了东西了。你应该把反照镜支起，看看后边。”忠告带点教训的口气，但又满含热烈的关怀。
    那辆车也同时煞住，从驾驶室的左边的窗口，伸出一个头发略现蓬松的姑娘的脑壳，朝我们车上看了一眼，随即把头缩进去，车门开了，她跳下来。这是一位年轻壮实，肤色微黑的姑娘，头发剪短了，一身蓝布工作服沾满了乌黑的油泥。
    “是你吗，小王？”我们车上的戴制帽的旅客一眼看见女司机，连忙从座位上站起，把头伸出窗子外，快活地问。
    “是你吗，贺同志？”女司机赶上几步，打算讲话。我们车子的马达已经响动了。
    “你这个小家伙，当了司机了，两条大辫子到哪里去了？”这位贺同志含笑的问话还没有得到回答，公路车跑开好远了。他复归原位，跟邻座谈起，这姑娘是他们乡的。前年没考起中学，到乡政府哭了一场，去年她入了民办中学，快活极了。不久，乡里保送她上了汽车司机训练班。临了他笑着推测：
    “辫子不见了，一定是嫌它碍事，把它剪了。”
    在沿山起伏的红土铺沙的路上，车子用更大的速度继续地往前面飞奔。过了沩水桥，到达宁乡站，看见站里站外，排满了汽车，我们的车子只略停一停，就又开动了。
    车到目的地，还只有九点十分，从前要挨到十一点多钟。
    “今天的车跑得真快。”贺同志说。
    离别只有五个来月的这片襟山带水的新兴工业区又变样子了。远远的地方，衬着青的山，新添了几个烟囱，几幢新楼。挨近医院的一座大土山已经无影无踪了。安化茶厂的一排排红顶粉壁的厂房霸占了山的原址。从医院门口，往左首拐弯，在新修的一条马路的南边，也出现十来幢新屋，这群建筑物的中间一幢的屋瓦上，有条横书的白色的标语：
    “用冲天的干劲建设湖南第一纸板厂。”
    五个月以前，我碰到过这家新厂年轻的厂长。那时候，这个工厂，连厂址在内，还在他的口袋里，那就是说，还只是在他口袋里的计划书上面。现在，时间没有过半年，他们工厂的第一批房屋已经出现在公路旁边，车窗前面了。
    用冲天的干劲，继续跃进吧，包括剪了辫子和没剪辫子的姑娘们在内的一切新的勇士们！只要是年年月月保持这一种高速度，我们一定能够大大地缩短通向共产主义社会的行程。
    用冲天的干劲，移山的精神作为我们伟大的国庆十周年的献礼吧，只有这样的干劲和精神才是极其隆重，最为珍贵的礼品。
                      一九五九年
