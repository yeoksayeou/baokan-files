The Greatness of Heaven and Earth
Zhou Fen

Don't you think the Earth is big? Seven continents, four oceans, dozens of countries, and over two billion people – to the average person, the Earth is vast.

But what is the Earth? The Earth is just one of the nine planets. Among the planets, Jupiter is the largest, its volume 1,300 times greater than Earth's. We only see it as a bean-sized speck because of the distance. If Jupiter were moved to the Moon's position, it would cover half the sky. Unfortunately, we cannot move it. In terms of mass, Jupiter is more than 300 times larger than Earth. Because Jupiter has such a large mass, its gravitational pull is also strong. An object weighing one *jin* on Earth would weigh two and a half *jin* on Jupiter.

Furthermore, Jupiter is merely an appendage of the Sun, its mass less than one-thousandth of the Sun's. The Sun could hold 1.3 million Earths or 64 million Moons. The reason we see the Sun and Moon as roughly the same size is due to their different distances: things farther away look smaller, while things closer look larger. The Sun is extremely far from Earth, about 150 million kilometers away. If it were possible to travel to the Sun by Tu-114 airplane, flying at 1,000 kilometers per hour, it would take seventeen years of non-stop flight to reach the destination.

But the distance from the Sun to Pluto is forty times greater than its distance from the Sun to Earth. Kepler's laws of planetary motion state: "The square of the time required for a planet to orbit the Sun is proportional to the cube of its distance from the Sun." Therefore, Pluto takes 250 years to orbit the Sun once. Very few people in the world can witness half of its orbit.

The Sun, Moon, planets, plus comets and meteors, together are called the solar system. Compared to the known extent of the universe, the solar system is just a drop in the bucket. When you look at the sky at night, besides a few planets, what you see are all stars. These stars appear to be fixed, but they are not. It is just that they are so very, very far away that their movement is almost imperceptible. Every star is similar to the Sun, and some are especially large. The largest one is actually 10 billion times larger than the Sun!

Stars generally prefer to live collectively: some in pairs (binary stars), some in groups of three or five (multiple stars), and some in organized groups (star clusters). Single stars living independently are very rare.

Speaking of the distances to stars, it is even more astounding. These distances cannot be measured with a ruler, nor can they be reached by a Tu-114 airplane in a lifetime. A different "ruler" must be created, called a "light-year." Light travels at 300,000 kilometers per second. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year at that speed. This distance is ten trillion kilometers. A star one light-year away is considered extremely far, but the closest star to us is not just one light-year away, but four light-years and four light-months away.

This is only the closest star to us, it is nothing. To say nothing of other things, like the Milky Way (Heavenly River) we see in the autumn night sky, its domain is very large, with a diameter of 100,000 light-years. A distance of 100,000 light-years is difficult to imagine. Let's use another analogy: using the finest and lightest spider silk to wrap around the Earth's equator would require only one kilogram of material. To connect the Earth and the Sun would require only four tons. But to stretch it into the diameter of the Milky Way would require no less than 25 billion tons.

The Milky Way is just one of the spiral nebulae. Each nebula is composed of thousands upon thousands of stars. Over a hundred million nebulae have been observed. The Milky Way and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds in the southern sky form a small group, while the Andromeda Galaxy, which can be vaguely seen with the naked eye, and four small nebulae nearby form another small group. The Andromeda Galaxy is about 1.5 million light-years away from us, and its diameter is one and a half times larger than the Milky Way. With the largest telescopes today, nebulae can be seen at a distance of 5 billion light-years; however, this is not the boundary of the universe. In fact, the universe has no boundary.

    天地之大
    周芬
    你说地球不大吗？七大洲，四大洋，几十个国家，二十多亿人口，在一般人看来，地球是很大的。
    但地球算什么呢？地球不过是九大行星之一。行星中，最大的算木星，它的体积比地球大一千三百倍，只因距离远，才看见它像颗豆的大小。如果把木星移到月亮所在的位置，那将盖满半个天空，可惜我们移它不动。按质量说，木星比地球大三百多倍。因木星质量大，所以吸力也大，地球上一斤重的东西，到了它上面就变成二斤半。
    再说，木星不过是太阳的一个附属品罢了，它的质量还不及太阳的千分之一。太阳的肚子里可以容纳一百三十万个地球，六千四百万个月亮。我们平时看见的太阳和月亮所以差不多一样大小，那是因为远近不同的缘故：远的东西看起来小一点，近的东西看起来大一点。太阳跟我们地球的距离太远了，算起来是一亿五千万公里。如果能够的话，坐图—114飞机去太阳旅行，每小时飞一千公里，需要作十七年不着陆飞行，才可以到达目的地。
    但太阳离冥王星的距离，比离地球还远四十倍。开普勒的行星运动定律说：“行星绕太阳一周所需时间的平方，和它与太阳距离的立方成正比。”因此，冥王星绕太阳一周便需要二百五十年，世界上能看见它转半圈的人实在少得很。
    日月和行星，加上彗星和流星，合起来叫做太阳系。太阳系对已知的宇宙范围来说，也不过是九牛一毛和沧海一粟而已。晚上看天空，除了几个行星之外，所看到的都是恒星。这些恒星似乎是固定不动，但不是不动，只因距离我们很远很远，所以见它移动极小。每颗恒星都和太阳差不多，而且有的体积特别大，最大的一颗竟然比太阳大一百亿倍！
    恒星都比较喜欢集体生活：有的成双结对（双星），有的三五成群（聚星），有的组成团体（星团）。单身营独立生活的，是少得很的。
    说到恒星的远近，更是骇人听闻。这距离用尺量不尽，坐图—114飞机也终生到不了。要另造一把量天尺，名叫“光年”。光每秒钟行三十万公里，光年这个单位，就是以光速这样的快，行一年工夫的路程。这路程的长短是十万亿公里。离我们一光年的星，按说已算极远；但离我们最近的一颗，并不止一光年，而是四光年又四光月。
    这只是离我们最近的恒星，算不得什么，别的不多说，像现在秋天里夜晚我们所看见的银河（天河），它的领域非常大，直径有十万光年。十万光年这么大的距离，很难以想像，我们不妨另打个比喻：用最细最轻的蜘蛛丝沿地球赤道缠绕一周，只需一公斤的材料，若要将地球和太阳联起来，也不过四吨，但若用它扯成银河的直径，便非二百五十亿吨不可。
    银河只是漩涡星云之一，每个星云都是由成千成万的恒星组成的。现在观测到的星云已在一亿以上。银河和南天的大、小麦哲伦星云组成一个小集团，而肉眼能模糊看到的仙女座大星云又和它附近的四个小星云形成另一个小集团。仙女座大星云和我们相距约一百五十万光年，它的直径比银河的还大一倍半。用当今最大的望远镜，可以看到五亿光年远处的星云；然而这并不是宇宙的边界，事实上宇宙也没有边界。
