    The Summit of Mount Tai
    Yang Shuo

    Viewing the sunrise from the summit of Mount Tai has always been depicted as a magnificent spectacle. Some say: Climbing Mount Tai without seeing the sunrise is like a grand opera without a climax. The flavor is ultimately a bit bland.

    The day I went climbing, I happened to catch a rare, fine day. The sky was clear, not even a wisp of cloud could be seen. The mountain peaks, usually shrouded in mist, appeared distinctly. My companions all said happily, "We'll definitely see the sunrise tomorrow morning." I climbed the mountain with the same thought in mind.

    As I climbed from the foot of the mountain, carefully observing the scenery, I felt that I was not looking at Mount Tai, the most revered of the Five Great Mountains, but rather at a long scroll of green landscape painting of staggering proportions, unfolding upwards from below. The first thing to appear on the scroll was the Dai Zong Archway, a Ming Dynasty structure at the foot of the mountain. Gradually, Wangmu Pool, Doumu Palace, and the Sutra Rock Valley appeared... The mountain was deeper and more remarkable with each layer. Layer upon layer, it was impossible to know how much deeper and more remarkable it would become. Amidst the myriad mountains, there were occasional touches of extremely meticulous figures. In the Lüzu Hall beside Wangmu Pool, there were many Ming Dynasty sculptures, depicting Lü Dongbin and others, their postures and expressions so lifelike that you couldn't help but exclaim, "They're alive!"

    The painting continued to unfold. Not long after the verdant Cypress Cave appeared, we arrived at Facing-Pine Mountain. Strange peaks stood facing each other on both sides, covered with old pines of bizarre shapes. They must have been a thousand or eight hundred years old, their color so rich, so rich it seemed to flow down. Here, you might as well pretend to be a freehand figure in the painting, sitting in the Facing-Pine Pavilion by the roadside, looking at the mountain scenery, listening to the flowing water and the sound of the pines. Perhaps you will agree with the sentence "The Best Place on Mount Tai" inscribed by Emperor Qianlong. But wait, it's better to continue looking upwards...

    For a moment, I felt as if I was not only looking at a painting but also flipping through a messy draft of a history book. At the Dai Temple at the foot of the mountain, I had once touched the remnants of the Qin Dynasty's Li Si Small Seal script stele. Ascending the mountain, I had stood at the "Confucius Ascended Here" spot and had tea under the pine trees conferred the title "Grand Master" by Qin Shi Huang. I had also seen the "Mount Tai Perforated Stone" praised by Han Dynasty's Mei Cheng, and the large regular script Diamond Sutra, said to be written by Wang Xizhi or Tao Yuanming of the Jin Dynasty. The inscription on the cliff of Daguan Peak by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, commemorating Mount Tai, which we were about to see, was naturally a treasure, and the relics of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties were like exotic flowers and herbs, adorning this famous mountain everywhere. In a daze, I felt that the shadow of Chinese history seemed to flash before my eyes. If you want to capture some historical shadows, you can pick out a few rubbings of Mount Tai stone carvings at the tea shop in Chaoyang Cave. In addition to this, you can also buy precious medicinal materials produced in Mount Tai, such as apricot leaf ginseng, he shou wu, huangjing, and purple gromwell. We brewed a pot of mountain tea here and sat down to rest. We saw a group of children surrounding a flock of chicks, feeding them grasshoppers. The chicks' feathers were all gray, unlike what we usually see. When asked, the woman selling tea replied, "My children's father went up the mountain to dig medicinal herbs and brought back a nest of wild chicks." No wonder. Two wild chicks were vying for water, knocking over the water bowl and running onto the bluestone slab, covering the slab with many small "人" (person) characters. I couldn't help but look at this isolated family in the deep mountains and think: "While a large collective movement is happening down the mountain, they are still living this individual life, aren't they too isolated from the world?"

    Climbing up from Chaoyang Cave, we gradually approached the Eighteen Bends. The mountain road became increasingly dangerous, making people breathless with exhaustion. At this time, I had no mind to look at paintings, nor to flip through history, I only felt like I was ascending to heaven. People have always regarded climbing Mount Tai as ascending to heaven. If you don't believe it, look back at the road you've come from, there are cloud roads such as Cloud-Walking Bridge, First Heaven Gate, and Middle Heaven Gate leading to heaven. Right now, the South Heaven Gate is suspended above my head. Fortunately, there are stone steps that make up a heavenly ladder. Climbing slowly along the heavenly ladder, taking a few steps and resting, my waist and legs were sore, and I was sweating all over. Suddenly, a gust of celestial wind blew from the air, hitting my face, and I immediately felt refreshed all over. It turned out that I had climbed up to the South Heaven Gate and walked onto the Heavenly Street.

    Dusk had long fallen on Heavenly Street, and the fragrance of unknown flowers and plants floated everywhere. With a gust of wind,朵朵 white clouds floated past me, and the scenery in front of me gradually hid in the night. We found a place to stay in Qingdi Palace and went to bed early, hoping to see the sunrise tomorrow morning. But annoyingly, a large cloud of mist suddenly enveloped the mountaintop. It was thick and wet, quietly squeezing in through the cracks in the door and falling onto the pillow. I also heard a few scattered raindrops. I was a little anxious. A companion said, "It doesn't matter. The climate on the mountain is sunny one moment and cloudy the next, it changes greatly. Maybe it will be a fine day tomorrow morning, you wait and see the sunrise."

    When the next morning arrived, the clouds and mist on the mountaintop had indeed dissipated, but the sky was gloomy. Who knew if it would suddenly clear up? Anyway, we braved the early chill and climbed all the way to Jade Emperor Peak, which is the summit of Mount Tai.

    An old Taoist priest with a flowing beard stood with us on the summit of Mount Tai, pointing out the distant and nearby scenery to us, and finally said with a regretful tone: "Unfortunately, the weather is not good. I'm afraid you won't be able to see the sunrise."

    My heart became unusually clear, without any trace of regret. I gazed thoughtfully at the extremely distant place, and I saw an incomparably magnificent spectacle. Look at that vast and boundless Qilu Plain, so full of spirit! In the past, farmers each cultivated a small piece of land, making the motherland's plain look like an old monk's patchwork robe, fragmented, woven together from who knows how many small squares. But now, what a vast field, all connected together, just as closely as the peasants of the commune are connected. The wheat has just ripened, and where the south wind blows, the waves of wheat rise and fall, as if the earth is also rippling with brocade patterns like silk. And look at the misty horizon, raising a band of smoke and dust. That's not the so-called "Nine Points of Qi Smoke." My companion told me that it might be an iron and steel plant. Whether it's an iron plant, a steel plant, or some other factory, there are tens of thousands of skillful and strong hands, cooperating with the unified rhythm of the people of the whole country, forging the mountains and rivers of the motherland with steel.

    Look again, isn't that the Yellow River faintly shining on the horizon? And that winding around the foot of the mountain is naturally the Wen River. And those countless small buns arching under Mount Tai's knees are many famous mountains such as Mount Culai. The Yellow River and the Wen River are just like two fluttering colorful ribbons, being played with by two invisible big hands; and the continuous large and small mountains are like many dragon lanterns, rolling and dancing together—the entire landscape is rejoicing!

    If Mount Tai is a magnificent long scroll of green landscape painting slowly unfolding, then this scroll has now fully unfolded, revealing the most wonderful part of the painting.

    If I was flipping through some historical drafts on the road to Mount Tai, then now I can be considered to have turned to the truly magnificent entrepreneurial history of our nation.

    While I was contemplating quietly, the old Taoist priest politely apologized, saying that the other Taoist priests had gone down the mountain to cut wheat, leaving him alone, unable to even boil water for us to drink. I asked him who he was cutting wheat for. The old Taoist priest said: "The commune. Don't think that there are only a few households scattered on the mountain, they are all organized into the commune." I remembered my thoughts about the tea shop in Chaoyang Cave and felt a little ashamed.

    Some companions felt that not being able to see the sunrise was always a bit of a pity. Comrade, what else are you dissatisfied with? In fact, we clearly saw another more glorious sunrise. This round of dawn sun leapt out from the historical horizon of our nation, flashing with thousands of rays of red light, shining on this world.

    Great and bright motherland, may you forever "rise like the sun"!

    泰山极顶
    杨朔
    泰山极顶看日出历来被描绘成十分壮观的奇景。有人说：登泰山而看不到日出，就像一出大戏没有戏眼。味儿终究有点寡淡。
    我去爬山那天，正赶上个难得的好天，万里长空，云彩丝儿都不见，素常烟雾腾腾的山头，显得眉目分明。同伴们都喜的说：“明儿早晨准可以看见日出了。”我也是抱着这种想头，爬上山去。
    一路从山脚往上爬，细看山景，我觉得挂在眼前的不是五岳独尊的泰山，却像一幅规模惊人的青绿山水画的长卷，从下面倒展开来。最先露出在画卷的是山根底那座明朝建筑岱宗坊。慢慢地便现出王母池、斗母宫、经石峪……山是一层比一层深，一叠比一叠奇。层层叠叠，不知还会有多深多奇。万山丛中，时而点染着极其工细的人物。王母池旁边吕祖殿里有不少尊明塑，塑着吕洞宾等一些人，姿态神情是那样有生气，你看了，不禁会脱口赞叹说：“活啦。”
    画卷继续展开，绿荫森森的柏洞露面不太久，便来到对松山。两面奇峰对峙着，满山峰都是奇形怪状的老松，年纪怕不有个千儿八百年，颜色竟那么浓，浓得好像要流下来似的。来到这儿，你不妨权当一次画里的写意人物，坐在路旁的对松亭里，看看山色，听听流水和松涛。也许你会同意乾隆题的“岱宗最佳处”的句子。且慢，不如继续往上看的为是……
    一时间，我又觉得自己不仅是在看画卷，却又像是在零零乱乱翻着一卷历史稿本。在山下岱庙里，我曾经抚摸过秦朝李斯小篆的残碑。上得山来，又在“孔子登临处”立过脚，秦始皇封的五大夫松下喝过茶。还看过汉枚乘称道的“泰山穿霤石”，相传是晋朝王羲之或者陶渊明写的斗大的楷书金刚经。将要看见的唐玄宗在大观峰峭壁上刻的纪泰山铭自然是珍品，宋元明清历代的遗迹更像奇花异草一样，到处点缀着这座名山。一恍惚，我觉得中国历史的影子仿佛从我眼前飘忽而过。你如果想捉住点历史的影子，尽可以在朝阳洞那家茶店里挑选几件泰山石刻的搨片。除此而外，还可以买到泰山出产的杏叶参、何首乌、黄精、紫草一类名贵药材。我们在这里泡了壶山茶喝，坐着歇乏，看见一堆孩子围着群小鸡，正喂蚂蚱给小鸡吃。小鸡的毛色都发灰，不像平时看见的那样。一问，卖茶的妇女搭言说：“是俺孩子他爹上山挖药材，拣回来的一窝小山鸡。”怪不得呢。有两只小山鸡争着饮水，蹬翻了水碗，往青石板上一跑，满石板印着许多小小的“个”字。我不觉望着深山里这户孤零零的人家想：山下正闹大集体，他们还过着这种单个的生活，未免太与世隔绝了吧？”
    从朝阳洞再往上爬，渐渐接近十八盘，山路越来越险，累的人发喘。这时我既无心事看画，又无心事翻历史，只觉得像在登天。历来人们也确实把爬泰山看做登天。不信你回头看看来路，就有云步桥、一天门、中天门一类上天的云路。现时悬在我头顶上的正是南天门。幸好还有石磴造成的天梯。顺着天梯慢慢爬，爬几步，歇一歇，累的腰酸腿软，浑身冒汗。忽然有一阵仙风从空中吹来，扑到脸上，顿时觉得浑身上下清爽异常。原来我已经爬上南天门，走上天街。
    黄昏早已落到天街上，处处飘散着不知名儿的花草香味。风一吹，朵朵白云从我身边飘浮过去，眼前的景物渐渐都躲到夜色里去。我们在青帝宫寻到个宿处，早早睡下，但愿明天早晨能看到日出。可是急人的很，山头上忽然漫起好大的云雾。又浓又湿，悄悄挤进门缝来，落到枕头边上，我还听见零零星星几滴雨声。我有点焦虑，一位同伴说：“不要紧。山上的气候一时晴，一时阴，变化大的很，说不定明儿早晨是个好天，你等着看日出吧。”
    等到明儿早晨，山头上的云雾果然消散，只是天空阴沉沉的，谁知道会不会忽然间晴朗起来呢？不管怎样，我们还是冒着早凉，一直爬到玉皇顶，这儿便是泰山的极顶。
    一位须髯飘飘的老道人陪我们立在泰山极顶上。指点着远近风景给我们看，最后带着惋惜的口气说：“可惜天气不佳，恐怕你们看不见日出了。”
    我的心却变得异常晴朗，一点都没有惋惜的情绪。我沉思地望着极远极远的地方，我望见一幅无比壮丽的奇景。瞧那莽莽苍苍的齐鲁大原野，多有气魄。过去，农民各自摆弄着一小块地，弄得祖国的原野像是老和尚的百衲衣，零零碎碎的，不知有多少小方块拼织到一起。眼前呢，好一片大田野，全联到一起，就像公社农民联的一样密切。麦子刚刚熟，南风吹动处，麦浪一起一伏，仿佛大地也漾起绸缎一般的锦纹。再瞧那渺渺茫茫的天边，扬起一带烟尘。那不是什么“齐烟九点”。同伴告诉我说那也许是炼铁厂。铁厂也好，钢厂也好，或者是别的什么工厂也好，反正那里有千千万万只精巧坚强的手，正配合着全国人民一致的节奏，用钢铁铸造着祖国的江山。
    你再瞧，那在天边隐约闪亮的不就是黄河，那在山脚缠绕不断的自然是汶河。那拱卫在泰山膝盖下的无数小馒头却是徂徕山等许多著名的山岭。那黄河和汶河又恰似两条飘舞的彩绸，正有两只看不见的大手在耍着；那连绵不断的大小山岭却又像许多条龙灯。一齐滚舞——整个山河都在欢腾着啊。
    如果说泰山是一大幅徐徐展开的青绿山水长卷，那么这幅长卷到现在才完全展开，露出画卷最精彩的部分。
    如果说我在泰山路上是翻着什么历史稿本，那么现在我才算翻到我们民族真正宏伟的创业史。
    我正在静观默想，那个老道人客气地陪着不是，说是别的道士都下山割麦子去了，剩他自己，也顾不上烧水给我们喝。我问他给谁割麦子，老道人说：“公社啊。你别看山上东一户，西一户，也都组织到公社里去了。”我记起自己对朝阳洞那家茶店的想法，不觉有点内愧。
    有的同伴认为没能看见日出，始终有点美中不足。同志，你还有什么不满意的？其实我们分明看见另一场更加辉煌的日出。这轮晓日从我们民族历史的地平线上一跃而出，闪射着万道红光，照临到这个世界上。
    伟大而光明的祖国啊，愿你永远“如日之升”！
