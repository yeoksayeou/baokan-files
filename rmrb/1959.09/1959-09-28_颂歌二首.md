    Two Odes
    Tián Jiān
      Kunlun, look at our Kunlun Mountains, dressed in festive attire; it has summoned its youth and taken off its white hair. How many thousands of years have passed? The orioles just flew to the hydroelectric station; iron towers rise in the valleys, Kunlun is putting golden flowers in its hair. It stretches out its huge arms, one hand holding up a golden cup; this golden cup holds up the Yellow River water, writing new poems for the era. The Yellow River water, with its vast waves, flows turbulently to the commune; if anyone asks where the oriole is? Could it be your commune! Kunlun sends golden flowers to the majestic Sanmenxia; on the golden waves, hydroelectric stations rise one after another. The bird of light and happiness constantly asks Kunlun—the white-haired old man is gone, Kunlun has become young. Friends, listen to the era speaking, history has opened a new era. I sing of the People's Republic, this year is its tenth birthday. The oriole is shaking golden flowers, waiting for the east wind to guide it, standing at the gate of this paradise, letting the east wind blow all over the earth!
      Drummer, your face is like a round moon, the moon shining on the hand drum. This hand drum is like the sky, this hand drum is like a mountain ridge, this hand drum is like a grassland, this hand drum is like a pasture, you shake the sky, you beat the mountain ridge with a booming sound. You turn the grassland into a garden. You carry the pasture on your shoulders. You, the drummer of the People's Republic, you hold this drum high; to announce to thousands of laborers—the people's commune is strength; we are the creators of truth, and we will determine the direction of history. The sound of the drum rotates with your arms, moon, moon, shining on the drum. Your arms wave frequently, your skirt shines brightly. Green skirt, golden arms, flying with the sound of your drum. The sky is rising with you, the trees are singing with you. You are dancing with your heart, moon, shining on the drum.

    颂歌二首
    田间
      昆仑请看我们的昆仑山，换上了节日的衣衫；他已经把青春召来，摘下那头上的白发。这是几万年的时间？春莺才飞向水电站；山谷里升起了铁塔，昆仑他正把金花插。他伸出巨大的手臂，一只手托起了金杯；这金杯捧起黄河水，为时代写下新诗篇。黄河水万顷的波浪，滔滔地奔流到公社；谁要问春莺在哪里？莫非呵就是你公社！昆仑把一支支金花，送给雄伟的三门峡；金色的浪涛上面，浮起一座座水电站。光明与幸福之鸟，时时向昆仑探问——白发老人已不见，昆仑变成了青年。朋友们听时代在发言，历史开辟了新纪元。我歌唱人民共和国，今年是他的十周岁。春莺呵摇着金的花，要听候东风来指点，站在这乐园的门口，让东风把大地吹遍！
      鼓手你的脸像一轮月亮，月亮呵照在手鼓上。这手鼓好像是天空，这手鼓好像是山岗，这手鼓好像是草地，这手鼓好像是牧场，你把天空摇动起来，你把山岗咚咚敲响。你把草地变成花园。你把牧场背在肩上。你呀人民共和国的鼓手，你把这鼓高高地举起；来向千万劳动者宣告——人民公社就是力量；我们是真理的创造人，要决定历史的方向。鼓声随着手臂旋转，月亮月亮照在鼓上。你的手臂频频挥动，你的衣裙灿灿发光。绿的衣裙，金的手臂，随着你的鼓声飞扬。天空随着你在上升，大树随着你在歌唱。你用你的心在欢舞，月亮呵照在手鼓上。
              九月作
