Increase Production and Practice Economy, A Double Leap Forward

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party called on the people of the whole country to "practice economy while vigorously increasing production." The resolution pointed out: "Increasing production on the one hand and practicing economy on the other, building the country with diligence and thrift, running people's communes with diligence and thrift, running all enterprises and undertakings with diligence and thrift, and managing households with diligence and thrift, this is the way to enrich and strengthen our country, and this is also the key to striving to fulfill and overfulfill this year's plan." In the short span of over twenty days since the Party's call was issued, a vigorous new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy has been launched in enterprises and communes across the country. Output is rising sharply, quality is gradually improving, and costs are constantly decreasing. Practicing economy has become a very widespread mass movement. Shandong Province has proposed the goal of saving one million tons of coal, seven thousand tons of steel, sixty to seventy thousand cubic meters of wood, and sixteen thousand tons of cement in the second half of the year on the basis of increased production. This is a good example of practicing economy.

Practicing both increased production and economy is a basic principle for our country's construction. The implementation of this principle has achieved tremendous results over the years. Especially since 1958, industry and agriculture have seen an unprecedented Great Leap Forward, and while vigorously developing production, economy has also been remarkably effective. This year, in the new high tide of the leap forward, we must make production grow at an even greater speed, and of course, we must pay more attention to economy. Can economy and increased production both achieve a leap forward? Is there great potential for economy? The vast number of cadres and people answer this question in the affirmative. However, some people believe that there is a contradiction between increased production and economy, and that the potential for economy has been exhausted. Therefore, they do not actively and proactively practice economy in production. Obviously, this is completely wrong. Facts have proved that there is great potential for practicing economy in production. Only by comprehensively saving manpower, materials, and financial resources can production leap forward even better.

First of all, there is great potential in saving materials. Industrial production requires raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, and agricultural production requires seeds, fertilizers, tools, and so on. Currently, in industrial production, have all enterprises maximized the use of materials? This can be seen very clearly from the comparison of material consumption in similar types of production. For example, in iron production, in key steel enterprises, some units consume only over 600 kilograms of coke to produce one ton of pig iron, but the average consumption of key enterprises nationwide is over 700 kilograms; in local steel enterprises, some places consume only over 1,100 kilograms of coke to produce one ton of pig iron, but the average consumption of local steel enterprises nationwide is over 1,600 kilograms, a difference of as much as 500 kilograms. The Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory consumes 12,748 kilograms of metal for each horizontal boring machine it produces, while the Kunming Machine Tool Factory consumes 17,450 kilograms of metal for the same horizontal boring machine. The Jinan Match Factory consumes 0.016 cubic meters of logs per case (100 packs) of matches, while the Tianshui Match Factory consumes as much as 0.039 cubic meters, a difference of more than double. Of course, the specific conditions of these enterprises (such as the technical level of workers and equipment) are not exactly the same, but the potential for economy is clearly there. In various industries of industrial production, there are huge differences in the consumption of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity. If the consumption is reduced to an advanced level, the materials saved will be a very considerable figure. We can still use the previous examples to calculate: If the coke consumption in iron production in key steel enterprises and local steel enterprises all reaches the advanced level, the country can save about 12,000 tons of coke every day, equivalent to 30,000 tons of raw coal, and nearly 11 million tons of raw coal can be saved in a year, which is about one-thirtieth of the national planned coal production this year. If the log consumption for match production can all reach the advanced level, more than 5,200 cubic meters of logs can be saved in the last four months of this year, which can increase the production of more than 300,000 cases of matches, which can supply 2.5 million households for a year, assuming each household uses an average of one pack per month. According to calculations by relevant departments, if the metal processing industry in the country increases the steel material saving rate by 3% in production, then 200,000 tons of steel can be saved in the second half of this year. These steels can produce more than 15,000 horizontal boring machines. Isn't this a great potential?

There is also great potential for saving materials in agricultural production. For example, how much chemical fertilizer should be applied to different crops at different growth stages, what pesticides should be sprayed to prevent and control different diseases and insect pests, and how much should be used? Many places have different usages. Too little is not enough to increase production; too much or improper use cannot achieve the goal of increasing production, but only increases the cost of production. In agricultural production, the rational utilization of water and fertilizer is extremely important. Wasting water and fertilizer is equivalent to wasting food. In the People's Victory Canal irrigation area in northern Henan, people's communes have widely promoted the methods of planned water use, scientific management, and rational irrigation in the drought resistance campaign, greatly enhancing the effectiveness of water. The Wangtun Brigade of the Qiliying Commune in Xinxiang County promoted the "trickle irrigation" method of irrigating multiple ridges with one ditch in Shaanxi Province, increasing the irrigation area from 1,400 mu to 2,800 mu per flow. The thirty-two flows used for irrigation in the entire irrigation area irrigated more than 102,000 mu of land in four days, and the average irrigation efficiency per flow increased by about 30% compared to last year. The Yangkou Commune in Shunchang County, Fujian Province, adopted the method of concentrated fertilization, and concentrated a small amount of fertilizer on or near the rice roots after artificial mixing, greatly improving the fertilizer efficiency. Three or four jin of fertilizer powder is more effective than the previous use of more than ten jin of fertilizer. In terms of harvesting crops, if farmers are educated in diligence and thrift and do a careful job of harvesting, some places can harvest an average of ten to dozens of jin more grain per mu. Conversely, if they do not pay attention to careful harvesting and scattering a lot, it will lead to a bumper harvest but not a full harvest.

Accelerating the turnover of working capital is the maximization of the use of financial resources and economy for industrial enterprises. Preventing over-quota reserves of raw materials, materials, fuel, etc., and the backlog of work-in-progress is an important aspect of saving working capital. Reducing non-production expenses and making the administrative structure of enterprises conform to the principle of streamlining, and saving expenses as much as possible, there is still much room for improvement in many enterprises. Practicing economy in this area also has great potential.

Saving labor and working hours in production also has great potential. In production, we must strive not to waste manpower and time, and produce the most products with the least number of people and time. This requires continuous improvement of labor productivity. There are many factors that increase labor productivity, and technological innovation is one of the most important factors. The Shenyang Water Pump Factory has saved more than 200,000 man-hours and more than 100 tons of metal materials by implementing more than 830 innovation proposals in the first half of this year. In technological innovation, we should consciously pay attention to the technological transformation of departments such as handling, feeding, packaging, forging, and carpentry. Many of these departments still use manual operations and occupy the most labor force. By increasing the components of mechanization and semi-mechanization through technological innovation, a large amount of labor can be saved. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, rural agricultural tool reforms have made great progress, which has a significant effect on improving labor productivity. We need to continue to strengthen this work in the future. In order to do a good job in technological innovation, we must continue to promote the style of combining daring to think, daring to do, and a realistic scientific attitude.

Another way to save labor and time and improve labor productivity is to further improve labor organization and fully utilize the labor efficiency of each person. This year, Huainan City, Anhui Province, through the reorganization of labor organization and the formulation of new staffing quota plans, has transferred one-third of its employees (more than 60,000 people) to support agricultural and new enterprise production, and can still complete production tasks that are doubled compared to last year. This shows how huge the role of rational labor organization and tapping potential is. Many people's communes have basically solved the problem of labor shortage by properly allocating labor and rationally arranging the production process. For example, the Jiade People's Commune in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, has fully utilized the superiority of the people's commune and changed the various unreasonable phenomena left over from the era of small-scale peasant economy that restrict the development of production, making the production process adapt to the characteristics of collectivized production. By the end of this year, it will be able to save 310,000 man-days and 170,000 animal-days. The labor force of this commune decreased by 11.8% in the first half of this year compared to last year, but the wheat harvesting and replanting of late autumn crops were completed ten days earlier than last year. The management of cotton fields was achieved without insects, weeds, or barren seedlings, and labor efficiency was increased by 20% to 30%. The rational arrangement of labor by the people's commune can guarantee the needs of agricultural production, and it has particularly important significance for the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

To vigorously save materials, funds, and labor, we must adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, and carry out mass movements on a large scale. The great achievements in economy in industrial and agricultural production over the years are also the result of fully utilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses. The saving of all manpower, materials, and financial resources must not only rely on the participation of the masses, but also rely on the supervision of the broad masses in order to effectively eliminate waste. In order to fully mobilize the masses, we must strengthen the ideological education of building the country with diligence and thrift, running the community with diligence and thrift, running industry with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift. Organizing the masses to use the methods of big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, and big debates to expose the waste phenomena in the production process and put forward various suggestions for practicing economy is a good method that has always been effective and should be continued.

On the basis of mobilizing the masses, we must also formulate various advanced quotas and necessary systems. This is especially necessary for industrial enterprises. Raw material and material consumption, man-hours, machine-hours, and material reserves all need quota management. With the raw material and material consumption quota, it is easy to check whether the use of raw materials and materials is wasteful; with the man-hour quota, it is easy to determine how much labor is needed to complete a certain amount of products, so as to establish a reasonable labor organization; with the machine-hour quota, the utilization rate of equipment can be improved; the reserve quota of raw materials and materials can prevent the backlog of working capital. The formulation of advanced raw material and material consumption quotas is especially important at present compared to other quotas. In particular, the consumption of coal, because coal is related to the production of many important industrial enterprises, and the consumption is large, it must be used as sparingly as possible. The metallurgical department, the power department, the railway department, the shipping department, and other industrial departments must strictly set out plans for saving coal in accordance with the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and resolutely implement them. In addition, industrial enterprises must also establish and improve the systems of material requisition, material return, warehouse management, attendance, quality inspection, machine equipment maintenance, technical appraisal before the mass production of new products, and various operating procedures, which are important for saving manpower, materials, and financial resources. The quotas for agricultural production, of course, cannot be required to be as precise as those for industrial production. However, according to the strength of the labor force, different labor objects, and relatively fixed arrangements for each person's labor (such as accumulating fertilizer, engaging in sideline production, etc.) during a certain period, this will obviously be of great benefit to increasing production and avoiding waste of labor. The amount of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. should also be reasonably controlled, and waste should be resolutely prevented.

Comrades on the industrial and agricultural production front! Actively respond to the call of the Party, further boost greater energy, so that increased production and economy can both leap forward, and use brilliant achievements to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day!

### 增产节约双跃进

    增产节约双跃进
    党的八届八中全会号召全国人民“在厉行增产的同时，必须厉行节约”，决议指出：“一面增产，一面节约，勤俭建国，勤俭办人民公社，勤俭办一切企业事业，勤俭持家，这是我们国家的富强之道，这也是争取完成和超额完成今年计划的关键。”从党的号召发布到现在短短二十多天内，全国各企业，各公社掀起了声势浩大的增产节约新高潮。产量直线上升，质量逐步提高，成本不断下降。厉行节约，已经成为当前十分广泛的群众运动。山东省提出的节约目标是下半年要在增产的基础上，节约煤炭一百万吨，钢材七千吨，木材六万到七万立米，水泥一万六千吨等。这是厉行节约的一个好榜样。
    厉行增产节约是我国进行建设的基本方针，这条方针的实行，多年来已经获得了巨大的成绩。特别是1958年以来，工农业生产出现了空前的大跃进，在大力发展生产的同时，节约也成效卓著。今年，在新的跃进高潮中，我们要使生产以更大的速度增长，当然也要更加注意节约。节约同增产能不能双跃进？节约是不是大有可为？对于这个问题，广大干部和人民的回答是肯定的。但是，也有一些人却认为增产同节约有矛盾，节约的潜力已经挖光，因而他们在生产中就不去积极主动地厉行节约。显然，这是完全错误的。事实证明，在生产中厉行节约是大有可为的。只有全面地节约人力物力财力，才能使生产向前跃进得更好。
    首先在物力的节约上就有着极大的潜力。工业生产要有原料、材料、燃料和电力，农业生产要有种籽、肥料、工具等等。目前在工业生产中，是不是所有的企业都已经最大限度地利用了物资呢？这从同类性质生产的物资消耗的对比中可以看得非常清楚，如铁的生产，在重点钢铁企业，有的单位炼一吨生铁只消耗焦炭六百多公斤，可是全国重点企业平均消耗量则为七百多公斤；在地方钢铁企业，有的地方炼一吨生铁只消耗焦炭一千一百多公斤，但全国地方钢铁企业平均消耗量则为一千六百多公斤，相差竟达五百公斤之多。沈阳机床二厂生产的一种卧式搪床，每台消耗金属一万二千七百四十八公斤，而昆明机床厂生产同样的卧式搪床，却要消耗金属一万七千四百五十公斤。济南火柴厂每件（一百包）火柴原木耗用量是零点零一六立方米，而天水火柴厂则高达零点零三九立方米，相差一倍以上。当然，这些企业目前的具体条件（如工人的技术水平和设备等）不完全一样，但是，节约的潜力显然是存在的。在工业生产的各个行业中，都有原料、材料、燃料、电力等消耗量的悬殊差别。如果消耗量都降低到先进的水平，节约的物资将是一个多么可观的数字。不妨仍用前面的举例来计算：重点钢铁企业和地方钢铁企业在炼铁生产中，如果焦炭的消耗量都达到先进水平，全国每天就可以节约焦炭一万二千吨左右，折合原煤为三万吨，一年可以节约原煤近一千一百万吨，这约等于今年全国计划煤产量的三十分之一。火柴生产原木消耗量如果都能达到先进的水平，在今年最后四个月中就能节约原木五千二百多立方米，可以增产三十多万件火柴，按每户每月平均使用一包计算，可供二百五十万户用一年。根据有关部门计算，全国金属加工业在生产中如果把钢铁材料节约率提高3％，那末今年下半年全国可以节约钢材二十万吨。这些钢材，可以生产卧式搪床一万五千多台。这难道不是大有可为么？
    农业生产中的物资的节约也有很大潜力。例如，各种化学肥料在不同作物的不同生长期应施用多少，防治不同的病虫害要喷撒哪些农药和用多少数量，许多地方都有不同的用法。量少，不足以增加生产；数量过多或使用不当，也不能达到增产的目的，只能增加生产的成本。在农业生产中，水和肥料的合理利用异常重要。浪费水和肥料就等于浪费粮食。河南北部的人民胜利渠灌区各人民公社在抗旱运动中，普遍推广计划用水、科学管理、合理灌溉的方法，大大发挥了水的效用。新乡县七里营公社王屯大队推广陕西省“细流沟灌”的一沟多畦浇地办法，由每一个流量浇地一千四百亩提高到二千八百亩。全灌区用于浇地的三十二个流量，四天内共浇地十万二千多亩，平均每个流量浇地效率比去年提高30％左右。福建顺昌县洋口公社采用集中施肥的办法，将少量肥料经过人工混合处理，集中施在稻根上或其附近，大大提高肥效，用三、四斤肥田粉就比过去用十几斤的肥效还大。在收割农作物方面，如果对农民进行了勤俭节约的教育，作到精打细收，有些地方平均每亩可以多收十几斤以至几十斤的粮食。相反的不注意精收细打，抛撒很多，就会造成丰产不丰收。
    加速流动资金的周转，对工业企业来说，就是最大限度地利用财力，就是节约。防止原料、材料、燃料等的超定额储备和在制品的积压，是节约流动资金的一个重要方面。减少非生产费用，使企业的行政机构符合精简的原则，尽可能地节省开支，这在不少企业还有许多值得改进的地方。在这方面厉行节约，同样大有可为。
    在生产中节约劳动力和劳动时间，也是潜力极大。在生产中必须力求不浪费人力和时间，用最少的人和时间生产出最多的产品。这就要求不断地提高劳动生产率。提高劳动生产率的因素是多方面的，技术革新是其中最重要的因素之一。沈阳水泵厂由于在今年上半年实现了八百三十多项革新建议，到年底共节约工时二十多万个和金属材料一百多吨。在技术革新中，应该有意识地注意搬运、进料、包装、锻工、木工等部门的技术改革。这些部门目前有许多还是用手工操作，占用劳动力最多。通过技术革新增加机械化半机械化的成分，就能够节约大批劳动力。1958年大跃进以来，农村中的农具改革有了很大的进展，对提高劳动生产率有显著的作用，今后仍需继续加强这方面的工作。为了搞好技术革新，必须继续提倡敢想、敢干同实事求是的科学态度相结合的风格。
    节约劳动力和时间，提高劳动生产率的另一个途径，是进一步改善劳动组织，充分发挥每一个人的劳动效能。安徽省淮南市今年通过整顿劳动组织，制定了新的定员定额方案，抽调出三分之一的职工（六万多人）支援农业和新企业的生产，仍然可以完成比去年增加一倍的生产任务。这说明合理地组织劳动力，挖掘潜力，有着多么巨大的作用。有不少人民公社由于妥善调配劳动力和合理安排生产过程，使劳动力不足的问题获得了基本解决。例如山西临汾县贾得人民公社，由于充分发挥人民公社优越性，改变小农经济时代遗留下来的束缚生产发展的各种不合理现象，使生产过程适应集体化生产的特点，到今年年底将能节约人工三十一万个和畜工十七万个。这个公社的劳动力今年上半年比去年减少11.8％，但是小麦收打和复播晚秋作物却比去年提前十天完成，棉田管理作到无虫、无草、无荒苗，劳动效率提高了20％到30％。人民公社合理安排劳动力，可以保证农业生产的需要，而且对农林牧副渔的全面发展具有特别重要的意义。
    大力节约物资、资金和劳动力，必须坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，大搞群众运动。历年来工农业生产中节约的巨大成绩，也正是充分发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性的结果。所有人力、物力、财力的节约，不仅要靠群众的参加，而且要靠广大群众的监督，才能切实消除浪费现象。为了充分发动群众，必须加强勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办工业、勤俭办一切事业的思想教育工作。组织群众运用大鸣大放大字报大辩论的方法，揭露生产过程中的浪费现象，提出各种厉行节约的建议，这是一向行之有效的好办法，应当继续坚持推行。
    在发动群众的基础上，还必须制定各种先进的定额和必要的制度。这对工业企业特别必要。原料、材料消耗、工时、台时、物资储备，都需要有定额管理。有了原料、材料消耗定额，才便于检查原料、材料的使用是否浪费；有了工时定额，才便于确定完成一定数量的产品需要多少劳动力，从而建立合理的劳动组织；有了台时定额，设备的利用率才能提高；原料、材料等储备定额则能防止流动资金的积压。制定先进的原料、材料消耗定额较之其他定额在目前尤为重要。特别是煤炭的消耗，由于煤炭关系到许多重要的工业企业的生产，消耗量又大，必须尽量节约使用。冶金部门、电力部门、铁道部门、航运部门及其他工业部门，必须遵照党的八届八中全会的决议，严格定出节约煤炭的计划，并且坚决执行。此外，工业企业还必须建立和健全领料、退料、仓库管理、考勤、质量检验、机器设备维修、新产品大批投入生产前的技术鉴定等制度，以及各种操作规程，这对人力、物力、财力的节约都有重要作用。农业生产的定额当然不可能要求像工业生产那样精确。但是，根据劳动力的强弱，不同的劳动对象，在一定时期相对固定地安排每个人的劳动（如积肥，从事副业生产等），这对增加生产和避免劳动力的浪费显然会有很大的好处。种籽、化肥、农药等的使用数量，也应该合理掌握，坚决防止浪费。
    工农业生产战线上的同志们！积极响应党的号召，进一步鼓足更大的干劲，使增产和节约双双跃进，用辉煌的成绩来迎接伟大的国庆十周年！
