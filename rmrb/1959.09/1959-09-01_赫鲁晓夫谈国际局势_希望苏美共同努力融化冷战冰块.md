Xinhua News Agency, August 31st, Moscow dispatch: TASS reported on the 30th that the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, emphasized at a mass rally in the town of Vyoshenskaya on the 30th that he would visit the United States with good intentions and a fervent hope to make due contributions to easing international tensions and consolidating the cause of peace.

He said that we are determined to take measures to melt the "Cold War" ice and give the people of all countries a breather. We hope that the US government has the same desire.

On the 30th, Khrushchev visited the home of the famous Soviet writer Mikhail Sholokhov in the town of Vyoshenskaya (Rostov Oblast). Shortly after his arrival, a mass rally was held in the town. Khrushchev spoke at the meeting.

The majority of Khrushchev's speech was about the international situation, peaceful coexistence, and the upcoming mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet and American governments.

Khrushchev said that every sober-minded person knows that improving Soviet-American relations is not only beneficial to the people of the Soviet Union and the United States, but also to the people of all countries, large and small, because they do not want to fight but yearn for consolidated and lasting peace.

Khrushchev pointed out that now everyone is concerned about the issue of safeguarding world peace and is uneasy about it. They rightly believe that this is the main issue in international life. Khrushchev pointed out that if we look at the international situation from the main issue of defending world peace, it is not that bad. More precisely, the international situation is even good.

Khrushchev then spoke about the reply from the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Adenauer, to Khrushchev's letter of August 18th this year. Khrushchev said that at first reading, this reply gave a good impression.

Khrushchev said that if we are to talk about the substance of Mr. Adenauer's reply, then, first of all, it should be pointed out that it is more cautious in tone, and in this respect, it is very different from previous documents of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Khrushchev said that Mr. Adenauer mentioned some very important issues in his letter and expressed his hope to better understand these acute issues in order to develop cooperation between the two countries. If what is said is done, then it can be considered that we will be able to overcome the obstacles that divide us in the discussion of pressing issues in international relations, thereby making a certain contribution to easing international tensions and improving relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Khrushchev continued, "We hope that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany will more fully elaborate on its proposals for resolving major issues such as disarmament, eliminating the 'remnants of war,' and developing cooperation between our two countries. We believe that these issues are not unsolvable as long as the other party is willing. If Western countries truly want to peacefully resolve various pressing international issues, then these issues can be resolved."

Khrushchev said, "I am willing to believe that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany truly hopes to make its due contribution to the cause of easing international tensions."

Khrushchev promised to reply to Adenauer.

In his speech, Khrushchev also talked about the issues of Soviet economic and cultural development and the tasks of completing the Seven-Year Plan. Khrushchev also talked about Sholokhov's creations.

Khrushchev said that in recent years, Sholokhov has traveled abroad many times and has always returned with a full harvest. This great Soviet writer and plenipotentiary representative of the Soviet cultural world is welcomed everywhere.

Khrushchev pointed out that he was happy to invite Sholokhov to visit the United States with him. Khrushchev said, "I think this will be beneficial for Sholokhov to further understand the life of modern America."

    赫鲁晓夫谈国际局势
    希望苏美共同努力融化冷战冰块
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社30日讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫30日在维申斯卡亚镇的群众大会上讲话时着重指出，他将怀着善良的愿望和对缓和国际紧张局势、对巩固和平的事业做出应有的贡  献的热烈希望前往美国访问。
    他说，我们决心采取措施，来融化“冷战”冰块和使各国人民松一口气。希望美国政府也有同样的愿望。
    赫鲁晓夫30日到维申斯卡亚镇（罗斯托夫州）著名苏联作家萧洛霍夫家里作客。在他到达后不久，镇上举行了群众大会。赫鲁晓夫在会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫的讲话大部分是谈国际局势、和平共处和苏美两国政府首脑将要相互访问的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，每一个头脑清醒的人都知道，改善苏美关系不仅对苏美两国人民有好处，而且对全世界大大小小的国家的人民都有好处，因为他们不愿意打仗，而是渴望着巩固的持久和平。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，现在所有的人都关心保障世界和平的问题，并且在为这个问题而感到不安。他们公正地认为这是国际生活中的主要问题。赫鲁晓夫指出，如果从保卫世界和平这个主要问题来看，国际局势已经不是那样坏。更正确地说，国际局势甚至是好的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳对赫鲁晓夫今年8月18日的信件的复信。赫鲁晓夫说，初读起来，这封复信使人产生一种良好的印象。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果就阿登纳先生这封复信的实质来谈，那么，首先应该指出，它在语气上是比较谨慎的，而且在这方面它与德意志联邦共和国政府以前的文件大不相同。
    赫鲁晓夫说，阿登纳先生在信中谈到了一些非常重大的问题，并且表示希望更好地去了解这些尖锐的问题，以利于发展两国之间的合作。如果说了就做，那么可以认为，我们将能克服在讨论国际关系的迫切问题方面使我们产生分歧的障碍，从而在缓和国际紧张局势和改善苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系方面作出一定的贡献。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，我们希望德意志联邦共和国政府更加充分地阐明自己在解决裁军、消除“战争残余”、发展我们两国之间的合作这样一些重大问题上的建议。我们认为，只要另一方愿意，这些问题并不是不能解决的。如果西方国家真正希望和平解决各种迫切的国际问题，那么这些问题就可以得到解决。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我愿意相信，德意志联邦共和国政府真正是希望对缓和国际紧张局势的事业作出应有的贡献。
    赫鲁晓夫答应要回信给阿登纳。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中还谈到了苏联经济和文化发展的问题以及完成七年计划方面的任务。赫鲁晓夫还谈到了萧洛霍夫的创作。
    赫鲁晓夫说，最近几年，萧洛霍夫曾多次出国，每次都是满载而归。这位苏联大作家、苏联文化界的全权代表到处受到欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，他高兴地邀请萧洛霍夫同他一道去美国访问。赫鲁晓夫说，我想，这对萧洛霍夫进一步了解现代美国的生活是会有好处的。
