    Welcoming Distinguished Guests from Afghanistan
    At the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai, Sardar Mohammed Naim, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today for a visit to our country. This is another grand visit to China by Afghan national leaders following Prime Minister Daoud. The Chinese people extend a warm welcome to Deputy Prime Minister Naim's arrival.
    China and Afghanistan are close neighbors. Although the Pamir Mountains separate our two countries, the friendly exchanges between our two peoples have been continuous. As early as more than two thousand years ago, Zhang Qian, a famous Chinese traveler, first arrived in Afghanistan and opened up the road from China through Afghanistan to Central Asia and the eastern Mediterranean countries. This is the famous "Silk Road" in history. Through this road of friendship, the cultural and trade links between our two countries have become increasingly close. In the relations between our two countries, there are only records of friendship and goodwill, and never records of hostility and animosity. Although this traditional friendly exchange was once interrupted due to imperialist aggression, the friendship long hidden in the hearts of the two peoples could not be destroyed by the artificial obstruction of imperialism.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the traditional friendship between China and Afghanistan has been restored and developed under new conditions. In January 1955, our two countries officially established diplomatic relations. At the beginning of 1957, the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai paid a friendly visit to Afghanistan and was warmly received by the Afghan government and people. In October of the same year, Afghan Prime Minister Daoud was also invited to visit China and was warmly welcomed by the Chinese government and people. In the past year, the Afghan Kingdom's Ministry of Education football team and the Afghan cultural delegation have visited China successively; the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe, the Chinese Cultural Delegation, and the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe have also successively paid friendly visits to Afghanistan. Our two countries have not only sent trade or industrial delegations to each other, but have also signed barter and payment agreements on the basis of mutual benefit. Cultural and economic exchanges between China and Afghanistan are increasing day by day. The continuous strengthening of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Afghanistan undoubtedly has a profound foundation. The people of China and Afghanistan both oppose imperialist aggression, resolutely safeguard their national independence, and sincerely hope to build their motherland in a peaceful environment. Our country has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, is committed to promoting the Bandung spirit, advocates developing friendly and cooperative relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, non-aggression, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and resolutely supports the struggle of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries against imperialism and colonialism. The Chinese people are very pleased to see that the Kingdom of Afghanistan has consistently pursued a policy of peace and neutrality, and as a participant in the Bandung Conference, has consistently supported the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the principles of peaceful coexistence. In the joint communique issued by Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Prime Minister Daoud of Afghanistan after their mutual visits the year before last, they reiterated their support for the principles of the Bandung Conference and their support for the cooperation and understanding of the Asian and African people in maintaining their freedom and independence and promoting world peace. Obviously, the friendly relations established between China and Afghanistan on the common basis of the Bandung spirit are fully in line with the common aspirations of the two peoples and the common interests of the cause of world peace.
    In this refreshing autumn season, as the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching, the Chinese people are exceptionally excited to thank Afghan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Naim for bringing the sincere friendship of the Afghan people. We believe that this visit by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Naim will further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Afghanistan.

### 欢迎阿富汗贵宾

    欢迎阿富汗贵宾
    应周恩来总理的邀请前来我国访问的阿富汗王国副首相兼外交大臣萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆，定于今天到达北京。这是继达乌德首相之后，阿富汗国家领导人对中国进行的又一次隆重的访问。中国人民对于纳伊姆副首相的光临表示热烈的欢迎。
    中国和阿富汗是亲密的邻邦。我们两国的边境虽有帕米尔高山峻岭的阻隔，但是我们两国人民的友好往来却一直绵延不断。远在两千多年前，我国著名的旅行家张骞首先到达了阿富汗，并且开辟了从中国经阿富汗通往中亚细亚和地中海东部国家的道路。这就是历史上有名的“丝绸之路”。通过这条友谊之路，我们两国间的文化和贸易上的联系日益密切。在我们两国的关系上，只有友谊和亲善的记录，从来没有敌对和仇视的记载。这种传统的友好往来，虽然由于帝国主义的入侵曾经一度中断，但是长期蕴藏在两国人民心中的友谊，却是帝国主义的人为阻挠所破坏不了的。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以后，中国和阿富汗的传统友谊在新的条件下得到了恢复和发展。1955年1月我们两国正式建立了外交关系。1957年年初，以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团到阿富汗进行了友好访问，受到了阿富汗政府和人民的亲切接待。同年10月，阿富汗达乌德首相也应邀访问了中国，受到中国政府和人民的热烈欢迎。在过去一年中，阿富汗王国教育部足球队、阿富汗文化代表团先后访问了中国；中国歌舞团、中国文化代表团、中国杂技艺术团也相继到阿富汗进行友好访问。我们两国不仅互相派遣了贸易或工业代表团，而且在互利的基础上签订了换货和支付协定。中阿两国之间的文化和经济交流正在日益增进。中阿两国友好合作关系的不断加强，无疑有着深厚的基础。中阿两国人民都反对帝国主义的侵略，坚决维护自己的民族独立，真诚希望在和平环境中建设自己的祖国。我国一贯奉行和平的外交政策，致力于发扬万隆精神，主张在互相尊重领土主权、互不干涉内政、互不侵犯、平等互利和和平共处的五项原则基础上同世界各国发展友好和合作关系，并且坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。中国人民十分高兴地看到，阿富汗王国一贯执行着和平中立政策，而且作为万隆会议的参加国，始终不渝地拥护万隆会议的各项决议和和平共处的原则。我国周恩来总理和阿富汗达乌德首相在前年互相访问后所发表的联合公报中曾重申支持万隆会议的原则，支持亚非人民为维护他们的自由和独立、促进世界和平而进行的合作和了解。显然，中国和阿富汗两国在万隆精神的共同基础上所建立的友好关系，是完全符合两国人民的共同愿望和世界和平事业的共同利益的。
    在这秋高气爽的季节里，在中华人民共和国国庆十周年即将来临的时候，中国人民以异常兴奋的心情感谢阿富汗副首相兼外交大臣纳伊姆带来了阿富汗人民的亲切的友谊。我们相信，纳伊姆副首相兼外交大臣这一次的访问，必将进一步加强中阿两国友好合作关系。
