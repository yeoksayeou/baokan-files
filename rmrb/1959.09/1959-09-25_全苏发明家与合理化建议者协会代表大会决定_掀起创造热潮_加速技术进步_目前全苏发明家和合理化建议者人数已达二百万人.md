Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th: According to TASS, Moscow: Kariagin, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the All-Union Society of Inventors and Rationalizers, said on the 22nd that the number of rationalization proposers and inventors in the Soviet Union has increased from 555,000 in 1950 to 2 million.

He said that in the first half of this year alone, enterprises across the country adopted more than one million inventions and rationalization proposals, saving the country approximately 5.5 billion rubles, which is much more than the savings for the entire year last year, and more than nine times the savings in 1940.

Kariagin made these remarks at the first Congress of the All-Union Society of Inventors and Rationalizers, which was held in Moscow on the 22nd and 23rd. 1,500 representatives attended the congress.

In his report to the congress, Kariagin said that the mass movement of invention and rationalization proposals has now become the leading force in the technological progress of the Soviet Union, and the development of this movement is of particularly great significance at present. According to calculations, given the current level of the invention and rationalization proposal movement, the Soviet Union can save materials and funds worth a total of 100 billion rubles during the Seven-Year Plan, which is equal to one-sixth of the current Soviet national annual budget.

Kariagin said that this year is a year of vigorous upsurge in the activism of Soviet production innovators. Since the beginning of this year, production innovators have made many new patriotic initiatives. For example, the production innovators of the Moscow "Rubber" Factory proposed establishing a production rationalization fund named the Seven-Year Plan in enterprises. This initiative has been widely echoed in enterprises across the country. The situation in the first few months after the launch of the Seven-Year Plan fund movement shows that every rationalization proposer and inventor can put forward rationalization proposals whose economic effect is almost equal to their annual salary.

The Congress discussed Kariagin's report.

The Congress received congratulatory letters from the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union. The congratulatory letters expressed firm belief that Soviet production innovators will more resolutely strive for technological progress and for the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan.

The Congress finally unanimously passed a resolution, assuring the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government that they will go all out to complete the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU as quickly as possible.

The Congress also discussed the draft charter of the All-Union Society of Inventors and Rationalizers.

The All-Union Society of Inventors and Rationalizers was established at the beginning of last year. In just over a year, the association has established 35,000 grassroots organizations in Soviet industrial enterprises and agricultural production units.

    全苏发明家与合理化建议者协会代表大会决定
    掀起创造热潮　加速技术进步
    目前全苏发明家和合理化建议者人数已达二百万人
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：全苏发明家与合理化建议者协会组织委员会主席卡里亚金在22日说，目前，苏联的合理化建议者和发明家的人数已经由1950年的五十五万五千人增加到二百万人。
    他说，仅在今年上半年，全国各地企业就采用了他们提出的一百万件以上的发明和合理化建议，从而为国家节约了大约五十五亿卢布的资金，这比去年全年节约的资金多得多，比1940年节约的资金多九倍以上。
    卡里亚金是在全苏发明家与合理化建议者协会第一次代表大会上说这番话的。这次代表大会于22日和23日在莫斯科举行。参加大会的有一千五百名代表。
    卡里亚金在代表大会上作报告时说，群众性发明和合理化建议运动现在已经成了苏联技术进步的主导力量，这一运动的发展，在目前具有特别重大的意义。据计算，在发明和合理化建议运动目前已经达到的水平的情况下，苏联在七年计划期间就可以节约总值达一千亿卢布的物资和资金，这等于现在苏联国家年度预算的六分之一。
    卡里亚金说，今年是苏联生产革新者的积极性蓬勃高涨的一年。今年以来，生产革新者作出了不少新的爱国主义创举。譬如，莫斯科
  “橡胶”工厂的生产革新者倡议在企业中建立名为七年计划的生产合理化基金。这个倡议在各地企业中得到了广泛响应。建立七年计划基金运动开展后头几个月的情况表明，每一个合理化建议者和发明者都可以提出其经济效果差不多和他们一年的工资相等的合理化建议。
    代表大会就卡里亚金的报告进行了讨论。
    代表大会接到了苏共中央、苏联部长会议和全苏工会中央理事会的贺信。贺信中表示坚信，苏联生产革新者更加坚决地为争取技术进步、为争取提前完成七年计划而奋斗。
    大会最后一致通过决议，向苏共中央和苏联政府保证，他们将全力以赴来最快地完成苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议。
    大会还讨论了全苏发明家与合理化建议者协会的章程草案。
    全苏发明家与合理化建议者协会是去年年初成立的。一年多来，这个协会在苏联工业企业和农业生产单位中已经建立了三万五千个基层组织。
