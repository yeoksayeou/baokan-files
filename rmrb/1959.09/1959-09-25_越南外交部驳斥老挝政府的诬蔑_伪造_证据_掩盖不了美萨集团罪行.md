Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 24th: The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Phan Hien, was today instructed to issue a statement refuting the Lao authorities' fabrication of "evidence" to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos.

The statement said that the news released by the U.S. imperialism and the Lao authorities regarding captured prisoners and seized weapons, and all similar news, are completely fabricated, and the evidence they have presented is completely forged. Their purpose is to rudely and shamelessly slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that a simple look at the Lao authorities' contradictory statements is enough to assess their so-called evidence. Despite their best efforts to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, they have had to announce repeatedly that there is no conclusive evidence to prove that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is interfering in Laos, and they have never issued any statements about seizing the other side's weapons, yet now they suddenly claim that they have captured prisoners and seized hundreds of Czechoslovakian and Chinese-made guns. Even Western newspapers have repeatedly commented on this argument and expressed doubt about the Lao authorities' clumsy statements. The Lao authorities, following the will of U.S. imperialism, have become increasingly embarrassed in the face of world opinion, and now they are constantly spreading ridiculous rumors, such as saying that 2,000 overseas Vietnamese in Thailand have entered Laos to fight alongside the former Lao combat troops. These unfounded lies cannot deceive the opinion of the world's people, but instead further expose the unspeakable activities of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

At a press conference where he distributed the text of the statement, Phan Hien said that according to recent statements by the Lao authorities and news from foreign newspapers, the Lao authorities are currently fabricating evidence to provide to the so-called "United Nations Fact-Finding Mission to Laos" in order to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos.

He said that the Lao government is creating false witnesses because U.S. imperialism and its Lao running dogs, when faced with the Lao people rising up against their persecution, need to accelerate paving the way for foreign troops to interfere in Laos. He said that now U.S. imperialism is increasingly openly interfering in Laos. U.S. imperialism continues to reinforce Laos with a large number of military advisors, military personnel, and weapons, and even directly controls the power of the various military regions in Laos and commands the Lao armed forces. Currently, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) military bloc, headed by the United States, is holding a meeting in Bangkok to discuss the issue of invading Laos, and military delegations from many member countries of this bloc have successively entered Laos. Under these circumstances, U.S. imperialism and the Lao authorities are even more frantically slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to deceive the people at home and abroad, and to cover up U.S. imperialism's plot to further and greatly interfere in Laos and turn Laos into a military base for U.S. imperialism to prepare to launch a new war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

In answering some questions raised by reporters, Phan Hien also said that the Lao authorities' recent ban on reporters from Vientiane from interviewing in areas such as Sam Neua further shows that U.S. imperialism and the Lao authorities are attempting to cover up their evil schemes in Laos.

### 越南外交部驳斥老挝政府的诬蔑  伪造“证据”掩盖不了美萨集团罪行

    越南外交部驳斥老挝政府的诬蔑
    伪造“证据”掩盖不了美萨集团罪行
    据新华社河内24日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人潘贤今天奉命发表声明，驳斥老挝当局伪造“证据”诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝。
    声明说，美帝国主义和老挝当局关于抓到俘虏、搜获武器的消息和所有类似的消息完全是捏造的，它们所提出的证据完全是伪造的，其目的是为了粗暴地、无耻地诬蔑越南民主共和国。
    声明指出，只要看看老挝当局的矛盾百出的声明就足以对它们的所谓证据加以评价。尽管它们一直在千方百计地诬蔑越南民主共和国，可是它们又不得不多次宣布，没有确凿的证据足以证明越南民主共和国干涉老挝，它们也从未发表过任何关于缴获对方的枪支的声明，而现在却突然说它们抓到了俘虏和缴获成百支捷克斯洛伐克、中国制的枪支。就是西方报纸也曾多次对这种论调加以评论，并且对老挝当局的拙劣的声明表示怀疑。遵循美帝国主义意旨的老挝当局，已经在世界舆论面前越来越显得狼狈不堪，现在又不断放出了可笑的谣言，例如它们说什么旅泰越侨二千人已进入老挝同前寮国战斗部队一起战斗。这种毫无根据的谎言决不能欺骗世界人民的舆论，反而更加暴露了美帝国主义和它的走狗的不可告人的勾当。
    潘贤在分发这个声明的文本的记者招待会上发表谈话说，据老挝当局最近发表的声明和外国报纸的消息，目前，老挝当局正在捏造证据以提供给联合国的所谓“老挝局势调查小组委员会”，用来诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝。
    他说，老挝政府制造假证人是因为美帝国主义和它的老挝走狗在面临老挝人民起来反对它们的迫害的时候，需要加紧为外国军队干涉老挝扫清道路。他说，现在美帝国主义对老挝越来越明目张胆地进行干涉。美帝国主义继续向老挝增援大量的军事顾问、军事人员和武器，甚至直接操纵老挝各军区的大权和指挥老挝的武装部队。目前，以美国为首的东南亚条约军事侵略集团正在曼谷举行会议讨论侵略老挝的问题，这个集团许多成员国的军事代表团曾经接连地进入老挝。在这种情况下，美帝国主义和老挝当局就越加猖狂地诬蔑越南民主共和国，借以欺骗国内外人民，并掩盖美帝国主义进一步大力干涉老挝、把老挝变成美帝国主义准备发动印度支那和东南亚新战争的军事基地的阴谋。
    潘贤在回答记者们提出的一些问题时还说，老挝当局最近禁止万象记者到桑怒等地采访，这更说明美帝国主义和老挝当局企图掩盖它们在老挝进行的罪恶阴谋。
