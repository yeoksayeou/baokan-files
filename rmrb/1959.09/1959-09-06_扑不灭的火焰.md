    Unquenchable Flame
    Ge De
    Last year's September on this date was intoxicating. I felt as if I was once again among the ranks of the entire people's great steelmaking campaign. The wind whistled past my ears, the war drums beat frequently, and the shouts of the people rang out: "Resolutely complete the 10.70 target!"; I looked up and saw large red banners covering the sky, emblazoned with the large characters: "1958 - 11.08 million tons of steel." This is a miraculous feat unprecedented in history and unparalleled in the world, created by the 600 million Chinese people under the leadership of the Party!
    Since last year, an inexhaustible revolutionary flame has erupted from the Chinese people. The Party's guidance is to use this flame to melt the old China of "poverty and blankness" and forge a radiant socialist-communist new society.
    I have re-read several letters I received during the height of last year's mass steelmaking campaign. One letter was from a younger brother who works in a cotton textile factory. He told me that in order to quickly catch up with Britain and change the "poor and blank" face of the motherland, he participated in steelmaking. "I have learned light industrial production, and I have also learned heavy industrial production." Another letter was sent by a younger brother studying at a medical college: "In order to quickly build socialism, and to train ourselves into intellectuals who are both red and expert, we organized ourselves to go to a very distant place to make steel, and some old professors also participated." The third letter was written by my wife, who was working in the countryside for labor training. She said: "In our commune, a professional team has been organized to make iron and steel, and I have also been approved to participate. Do you know how energetic the masses are? When they pull the bellows, it's like a strong wind, and the sweat falls like rain, and no one is willing to rest, especially our branch secretary, who is like an old workhorse. People say that if we can make iron, then our place will have found a treasure, because iron ore and coal can be dug up everywhere on the mountains near our commune. ...When the steel was made, we were all so happy that we shed tears. You say, how lucky I am, after working in the countryside for a year, I not only learned how to farm, but also learned how to make steel, which is really rare! I think that in this way, our country's industrialization will be much faster than before." The last letter was written by my youngest brother. After graduating from senior primary school, he stayed in the countryside to engage in agricultural production. He told me: "I have been selected to make steel. I am so happy, now I am both a farmer and a worker. Once this steel is made, catching up with old 'England' will no longer be a problem. We will use tractors to farm, make new agricultural tools, make generators, and make cars, and it will not be difficult. I think we will soon have electric lights in the countryside. I see the future of the countryside, and I have changed my old idea of wanting to live in the city."
    Catching up with Britain, changing the poor and blank face of the motherland, quickly building socialism, greatly accelerating the speed of the motherland's industrialization, hoping for more tractors, cars, new agricultural tools, and electric lights in the countryside—which of these is not a beautiful and strong desire? It is these beautiful and strong desires that ignite the unquenchable flames in people. Compared with the surging flames of the tens of millions of people who participated in the great steelmaking campaign last year, my relatives are just a few small sparks. However, through these few small sparks, can't we just see that the workers, peasants, cadres, students, and people from all walks of life across the country are eagerly hoping to use their own hands to promote the early realization of these desires. The will and enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people are condensed into the revolutionary fire, what a source of inexhaustible vitality this flame has! Those engaged in light industry also want to engage in heavy industry, those studying medicine want to train themselves into intellectuals who are both red and expert through labor, cadres sent to the countryside want to learn more production knowledge, and those who are farmers also want to learn industrial production. From a few very ordinary people, don't we just see how hundreds of millions of Chinese people are striving to move upward, and which one is not striving to transform themselves at the same time as the social change? Who doesn't want to go to the steelmaking furnace to refine themselves? Who can slander this precious desire as "petty-bourgeois fanaticism" of those who breathe and share the same destiny as them? With such ardent desires, how can people not expect and urgently demand that the Party guide them in a timely manner to realize these desires; and the Party, as the organizer and leader of the masses' revolution, how can it not resolutely and timely call on, organize, and lead the masses to realize these beautiful desires? People are so happy that they shed tears, isn't this tear a crystallization of noble feelings? Seeing that the Party resolutely supports and vigorously leads them to realize their desires, seeing that the desires have been initially realized, and the steel made by their own hands has been born, it is probably difficult for anyone to avoid tears in great joy and great excitement.
    The flames of revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses have already forged last year's Great Leap Forward, forging 11.08 million tons of steel. Today, this flame is even more intense and higher. The small earthen furnaces have been transformed into small blast furnaces with the rise of the flames; the scattered small earthen furnace groups have gradually melted and crystallized into steel bases. The flames are rising, and the steel industry is also rising. Some self-proclaimed right-leaning opportunists, attempting to extinguish this unquenchable flame with their saliva, only expose their foolishness and ridiculousness even more.

    扑不灭的火焰
    葛德
    去年9月这个日子，令人心醉。我仿佛又已置身在全民大炼钢铁的行列中。疾风过耳，战鼓频催，人声呐喊：“坚决完成一○七○”；举头一看，见大红横幛，匝布周天，上缀大字：“1958年——1108万吨钢”。这是六亿中国人民在党的领导下亲手创造的亘古未有举世无双的神迹！
    去年以来，在中国人民身上，迸发了燃不尽的革命火焰。党的引导，要使这火焰烧化“一穷二白”的旧中国，冶炼出一个光华四射的社会主义—共产主义新社会来。
    我重新翻出去年全民炼钢高潮时接到的几封信。一封是一个在棉纺织厂工作的弟弟写来的。他告诉我，为了迅速赶过英国，改变祖国“一穷二白”的面貌，他参加了炼钢。“我学会了轻工业生产，也学会了重工业生产”。另一封是在医学院学习的弟弟寄来的：“为了迅速建成社会主义，为了锻炼成一个又红又专的知识分子，我们组织起来到一个很远的地方去炼钢，有的老教授也参加了。”第三封信，是下放劳动锻炼的爱人写来的。她说：“我们社里，组织了一个专业队去炼铁和炼钢，我也被批准参加了。你知道群众是怎样的干劲吗？他们拉起大风箱来，简直像刮大风，汗就像雨一样下，谁也不肯休息，尤其是我们的支部书记，简直就像个老干家。人们说，能炼出了铁来，我们这里就算出了宝啦，因为挨近我们社的那些山下，到处都可以刨出铁矿和煤来。……钢一炼出来我们都高兴得流出了眼泪，你说，我多幸运呀，下放一年，不但学会了种地，还学会了炼钢，真是难得呀！我看这样一来，我们国家的工业化，就要比原来快的多了。”最后一封信，是最小的一个弟弟写来的。他在高小毕业以后，就留在农村从事农业生产了。他向我说：“我被抽出来去炼钢了。我多高兴呀，现在我既是个农民，也是个工人了。这钢要一炼出来，赶老‘英’可就不成问题啦，我们种地用拖拉机，造新式农具，造发电机，造汽车，也不犯难了。我看咱们乡下也快有电灯了。我看到农村的前途啦，我改变了老想住在城市里的想法。”
    “赶过英国”也好，改变祖国一穷二白的面貌也好，迅速建成社会主义也好，大大加快祖国工业化的速度也好，盼望农村出现更多的拖拉机、汽车、新式农具和电灯也好，哪一宗不是美好而又强烈的愿望。正是这些美好而又强烈的愿望，点燃了人们身上扑不灭的火焰。我的这几位亲属，同去年大炼钢铁的几千万人的那腾腾大火比起来，只不过是几点小小的火星。但是，透过这几粒小小的火星，不是正好看出，全国的工人、农民、干部、学生，以及各行各业的人，都在热烈地期望着经过自己的双手，力促这些愿望早日实现。亿万人的意志和热情，凝聚成革命的烈火，这火焰有着怎样燃烧不尽的生命力的源泉哪！搞轻工业的也想搞重工业，学医的想通过劳动把自己锻炼成又红又专的知识分子，下放的干部企图多学得一点生产知识，当农民的也想学会工业生产，从几个极普通的人的身上，我们不是正好看到，亿亿万万的中国人是如何的发奋向上，哪一个人又不是力求在社会的改变中同时改造自己呢？谁又不想到炼钢炉旁去炼一炼自己呢？同他们共呼吸同命运的人，谁能把这种可贵的愿望诬蔑为“小资产阶级的狂热性”呢？人们有这样热烈的愿望，怎能不期望，不迫切要求党来及时的引导他们去实现这些愿望；而党，作为群众革命的组织者，领导者，又怎能不坚决地及时地去号召、去组织、去领导群众实现这些美好的愿望呢？人们高兴得流出泪来，这眼泪不正是一种高贵感情的结晶吗？看到党坚决地支持和大力领导了自己去实现自己的愿望，看到愿望已初步实现，亲手冶炼的钢儿已经出世，大欢喜和大激动中，涌出泪来，怕是谁也难以避免的。
    群众革命热情的火焰，已经冶炼出了去年的大跃进，冶炼出了1108万吨钢，如今这火焰更炽更高，小土炉已随着火焰的上升，转化成了小高炉；分散的小土炉群，已逐渐冶化晶结成了钢铁基地，火焰在上升，钢铁工业也在上升。一些自不量力的右倾机会主义分子，企图用唾沫去喷灭这扑不灭的火焰，只是愈发暴露他们的愚蠢可笑而已。
