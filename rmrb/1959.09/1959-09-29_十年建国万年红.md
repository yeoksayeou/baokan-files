Ten years of nation-building, ten thousand years of red
China's civilization spans five thousand years, how often have the people been masters? Tracing back to the political history of the last century, feudal autocracy was like a festering sore. The private ownership system intensified daily, the people's strength withered and they fell into poverty, imperialism followed with invasion, internal exploitation and external plundering made them increasingly weak. Patriotic people rose up repeatedly, reform and republic were still plagued by internal strife, national affairs became increasingly chaotic, and the capitalist system ultimately failed. The sound of the October Revolution's guns rang out, awakening mankind and enlightening the deaf, Marxism-Leninism is applicable to all the seas, and Comrade Mao Zedong's practice has led the way. The people's revolution has entered a new century, and ten years of construction have established a great order, with the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation, six hundred million people have risen up in the East. Eliminating exploitation began with land reform, destroying feudalism without a trace, Resisting America and aiding Korea upheld justice, protecting the homeland and defending the nation boosted courage. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries and eliminating evils balanced leniency and severity, consolidating the people's regime like a high wall, The Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns were combined to eradicate corruption and reverse the decline. The three major reforms and five movements laid the foundation for the nation's stability and harmony, Agricultural mutual aid followed the establishment of cooperatives, cooperation made the power even stronger. Joint state-private ownership of industry and commerce further stipulated unified purchase and sales to eliminate deception, The national economy initially recovered, promoting prosperity as lush as pine trees. Supporting ethnic groups to build autonomy, uniting all ethnic groups in joyful harmony, Living together harmoniously as a big family, like brothers and sisters, friendly and respectful. The Northwest and Southwest borders are solid, with different dialects and customs flourishing, Sorting out writing and respecting heritage, a hundred flowers bloom competing in beauty. National defense equipment is modernized, becoming increasingly powerful on land, sea, and air, The people's lives are improving daily, and international status is increasingly respected. Moreover, with the aid of the Soviet Union, joining hands and advancing together demonstrates great impartiality, The Five-Year Plan has been victorious, and we look forward to a more advanced Five-Year Plan. The Party calls for rectification to eliminate the three evils, the rightists release poison like stinging bees, Attempting to seize leadership was met with criticism, distinguishing right from wrong opened our minds. Promoting the nationwide Great Leap Forward, competing to be advanced without being conceited, Dredging rivers, digging channels, and building dams, water conservancy can yield a thousand *zhong* per *mu*. The Three Gorges Project breaks the sky and startles the earth, the Yellow River will clear, we can wait and wipe our eyes to see, Expanding air and car traffic connects neighboring countries, arriving in the evening as if rushing. Expanding the railway by 20,000 *li*, connecting all directions, The Yangtze River Bridge rises across the river, a natural barrier is crossed with divine craftsmanship. Determined to exterminate rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies, greening the wasteland to make it lush, A nationwide mass steel smelting campaign has been launched, developing treasures to the extreme extent. Thousands of cadres strive to go down to the countryside, integrating mental and physical labor, Culture and science advance together, with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping like a rainbow. Intellectuals take a great oath, to be loyal to the Party and show their sincere devotion, Together harnessing the overwhelming power, eliminating capitalism and promoting socialism is our duty. The Moscow Declaration was issued twice, uniting Asia and Africa to quell the flames of war, The peace camp is growing stronger daily, and the national liberation movement is surging. Internationalism touches people's hearts, promoting world unity, Flowers of friendship bloom everywhere, and the anti-imperialist tide is like a pilgrimage. Protecting the people's health and eliminating disasters, driving away the god of plague as if destroying evil, New achievements in educational revolution, integrating teaching, labor, and production. The general line of socialism, shines with boundless light across the sky, Politics takes command, the red flag bearer, breaking superstition and enlightening ignorance. Dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, working hard for three years without slackening, High mountains bow their heads, water yields, forgetting oneself, regardless of summer and winter. The situation develops into communization, the entire people leap forward again, first workers and peasants, The Eight-Character Constitution is promoted comprehensively, working hard, practically, skillfully, with full vigor. Industry and agriculture are expected to advance side by side, youthful spirit emerges daily flourishing, Production and life are promoted together, the people's livelihood is full of the joy of spring. The new resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, continue to leap forward with great spirit, Steel, coal, grain, and cotton are all implemented, being realistic and seeking truth expresses sincerity. Imperialist reactionaries slander recklessly, like dogs barking at Yao, we are accustomed to this, Redouble our efforts and boost our energy, sweeping away right-leaning and striking the bell. The people's commune has great power, conquering disasters, drought, and pests, Following the general line to create miracles, news of victory is reported repeatedly. Taking advantage of the victory, the entire people are determined to advance, heading towards the highest peak of society, Diligence and frugality are the foundation of nation-building, increasing production and practicing economy is universally followed. National sports are developing greatly, heroes compete like dragons and tigers, Several world records have been broken, and the achievements of the National Games shine brightly. Ten years of recuperation, a hundred years of planning, with ships and carts from all countries celebrating peace, Together ascending to the platform of joy, what a rare moment in a thousand years. A towering pillar stands before Tiananmen Square, the heroes' achievements are greater than the monument, Leading figures surpass their predecessors, the wise leadership demonstrates special merit. The magnificent and splendid New China, shines like the rising sun in the east, Joyfully celebrating the grand ceremony, ten years of nation-building, ten thousand years of red!
