Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The grand First National Games of the People's Republic of China will officially open at the Beijing Workers' Stadium on the afternoon of the 13th. This is the largest review of the development of sports in the ten years since the founding of New China.

More than 10,600 athletes from all ethnic groups will participate in forty-two competitions and exhibitions at this sports event, with nearly four thousand matches and performances. Prior to this, the Group A gliding, football and basketball preliminary and final rounds, polo, horse racing, steeplechase, nautical multi-sports, and parachute jumping, etc., which were completed or started early in Wuhan, Qingdao, Hohhot, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places, were only part of the prelude to this sports event with numerous items. The intense, enthusiastic, and wonderful competitions and exhibitions will mostly be arranged after the opening ceremony and will continue until the 27th of September.

The capital is the central hub of this National Games. It has gathered more than 7,700 athletes from all parts of the country and the People's Liberation Army. Athletes have been selected from the coast of the East China Sea to the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, from Changbai Mountain to the roof of the world, the Tibetan Plateau, and from the Inner Mongolia grassland to Hainan Island. The athletes include workers, farmers, herdsmen, students, teachers, cadres, medical workers, and people's soldiers from all walks of life, including Han, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Zhuang, Miao, Kazakh, Korean, and more than twenty other ethnic groups. They, together with the athletes of the National Games held in several cities other than Beijing, were carefully selected from more than 50 million athletes from the bottom up. The vast majority of athletes have been trained by New China. They are only about twenty years old, including 640 master athletes and more than 2,700 first-class athletes.

The preparation for the National Games has been going on for a whole year. All the complex and detailed work has been completed, from preparing competition venues to ordering various competition equipment, from arranging competition procedures to preparing trophies, medals, and certificates. More than 1,000 referees from all over the country have unified their understanding in studying the new rules and have conducted many on-site practices. After being inspected and qualified, more than 40,000 pieces of sports equipment in more than 170 categories have been distributed to various competition venues for use before the competition.

The stadiums in the capital's competition areas have been exquisitely decorated before the opening, with colorful flags fluttering in the wind. Various sports posters and large oil paintings are vividly arranged. The slogan "The First National Games of the People's Republic of China" is hung at the gates and on the rostrum of each sports venue. In the newly completed Beijing Workers' Stadium, which can accommodate 80,000 spectators, red slogans such as "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" and "Develop sports and strengthen the people's physique" have also been arranged.

The First National Games will receive sports delegations from socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam, as well as sports figures from countries such as France, Iraq, and Sudan. These country delegations and sports figures will participate in the opening ceremony on the 13th.

Before the large-scale competition begins, people are already making various analyses and estimations. The various competitions of the National Games have become one of the central topics of conversation in recent days. The development of sports in our country is so rapid, and the athletes of the twenty-nine delegations in the country have repeatedly exerted their energy, making people believe that in track and field, weightlifting, swimming, shooting, and other events, many national records will be broken, and some of these records will not only be broken by one person, but by a batch of people. In the past, some teams that had an overwhelming advantage in basketball, football, volleyball, and other ball games are also greatly threatened this time because of the large number of emerging talents. For example, in the preliminary rounds of basketball before the opening, the Guangdong men's basketball team, which was originally a Class C team, defeated the strong Shanghai team, which was originally ranked seventh in the Class A men's basketball team. In the football round-robin finals, the previously unknown Shaanxi team defeated the Hubei team and the Jiangsu team and won the right to compete for the top six places. The situation is roughly the same in volleyball and table tennis, which have not yet officially competed. All this indicates that the battle for the ball games will be unprecedentedly fierce, and the results will be varied, unpredictable and mysterious.

People from all walks of life in the capital are very interested in the National Games. The tens of thousands of admission tickets for the opening ceremony went on sale on the morning of the 7th and were sold out in less than an hour. It is estimated that the audience in the National Games will reach millions of people.

### 十年来体育运动成就的大检阅  第一届全国运动会今天开幕

    十年来体育运动成就的大检阅
    第一届全国运动会今天开幕
    新华社12日讯　规模盛大的中华人民共和国第一届运动会，13日下午在北京工人体育场正式开幕。这是新中国建国十年来发展体育运动事业的最大的一次检阅。
    一万零六百多名各民族运动员在这次运动会上进行四十二项竞赛和表演赛，比赛和表演赛将达四千多场次。在此以前，分别在武汉、青岛、呼和浩特、天津、北京等地提前结束或提前开始的甲组滑翔，足球和篮球分区预赛和决赛，马球、赛马、障碍赛马，航海多项运动和飞机跳伞等等，只不过是这场项目繁多的全国运动会的一部分前奏曲。紧张、热烈、精彩的比赛和表演赛，绝大部分都安排在开幕式以后进行，一直要进行到9月27日结束。
    首都是这次全国运动会的中枢所在。这里汇集了来自祖国各地和人民解放军的各民族运动员七千七百多人。从东海之滨到昆仑山下，从长白山到世界屋脊西藏高原，从内蒙古草原到海南岛，都选有运动员参加。运动员中包括了工人、农牧民、学生、教师、干部、医务工作者和人民战士等各行各业，包括了汉、蒙、回、藏、维吾尔、僮、苗、哈萨克、朝鲜等二十多个民族。他们和在北京以外几个城市进行的全运会的运动员一起，是自下而上地从五千多万名运动员中精选出来的。绝大部分运动员都是新中国一手培养起来的。他们的年龄只有二十岁左右，其中包括了六百四十名运动健将和两千七百多名一级运动员。
    全运会的筹备工作整整进行了一年。从准备竞赛场地到订作各种竞赛器材，从编排竞赛程序到准备奖杯、奖章和奖状，所有这些复杂细致的工作已经结束。来自全国各地的一千多名裁判员在学习新规则中统一了认识，并且进行过多次临场实习。一百七十多种、四万多件运动器材，经过检验合格后，比赛前已分发到各个竞赛场地使用。
    首都各个赛区的体育场所在开幕前都经过了精致的打扮，彩旗随风招展。各种各样的体育招贴画、大幅油画布置得生动醒目。各体育场所的大门口和主席台上，都挂上了“中华人民共和国第一届运动会”的大字标语。在新近落成的可容纳八万名观众的北京工人体育场内，还布置上了“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”、“发展体育运动、增强人民体质”的红字标语。
    第一届全国运动会将接待来自苏联、朝鲜、越南等社会主义国家体育代表团和法国、伊拉克、苏丹等国体育界人士。这些国家代表团和体育界人士将参加13日的开幕式。
    在大规模比赛开始以前，人们已在作种种分析，种种估计。全运会的各项比赛已成为近日来街谈巷议的中心内容之一。我国体育运动发展是这样迅速，全国二十九个代表团的运动员一再鼓足干劲，使人相信，这次在田径、举重、游泳、射击等项目中，将有许多项的全国纪录被刷新，其中有些项目将不只是被一个人刷新，而是被成批人刷新。过去一些在篮球、足球、排球以及其他球类赛中占压倒优势的代表队，因为后起之秀众多，这次也大受威胁。例如在开幕前的几轮篮球赛中，原来是丙级队的广东男子篮球队，就战胜了实力雄厚的、原来名列第七的甲级男子篮球队的上海队。足球循环决赛中，过去不大知名的陕西队竟战胜了湖北队、江苏队取得了争夺前六名名次的比赛权。排球、乒乓球尚未正式比赛，情况大致相同。这一切都预示着球类比赛中争夺战将打得空前激烈，而战果则变幻多端，神妙莫测。
    首都各界人士对全运会抱着莫大的兴趣。开幕式几万张入场券在7日晨开始出售，不到一个小时便卖得精光。预计全运会比赛中，观众将达到成百万人次以上。
