Exceeding the Leap Forward Target by 40%
    Our troops, encouraged by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have launched a new high tide of continued leap forward with construction as the center. On August 27th, the digging quality and speed of the entire team reached the highest peak since the start of construction this year.

    The fourth work team of the anti-aircraft artillery company of the first detachment, after studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, mustered their energy and increased their daily progress from 40 centimeters to 50 centimeters. The two groups of the fourth work team challenged each other and launched a labor competition. On August 27th, the entire company completed the day's leap forward target with an excess of 40%. Li Yuyou, the storekeeper of the second detachment, used to only manage storage and not repairs. After listening to the broadcast of the communique and resolutions, he took the initiative to repair the gasoline lamps. He said, "The Party Central Committee's resolution has illuminated my heart, and I want to muster my energy and do more work." After a few hours of intense effort, he repaired all the broken gasoline lamps in his custody. Gao Bingqiang

    超额40％完成跃进指标
    我们部队在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，掀起了一个以施工为中心继续跃进的新高潮。8月27日这一天，全部队的掘进质量和速度达到了今年施工以来的最高峰。
    一支队战防炮连的四作业班，学习了党的八届八中全会的公报和决议以后，鼓足了干劲，由日进四十公分提高到日进五十公分。四作业班的两个组，互相挑战，开展了劳动竞赛。8月27日，全连以超额40％的成绩完成了当天的跃进指标。二支队保管员李玉有，过去只管保管，不管修理。听了公报和决议的广播以后，他主动地修起汽灯来了。他说：“党中央的决议照亮了我的心，我要鼓足干劲，多干工作。”经过几小时的突击，他把保管的坏汽灯全修好了。　高炳强
