Semi-Monthly International Review
(September 1st to 16th)

    Red Rocket Flies into the Moon Palace

    These days, people all over the world are joyfully talking about the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket flying into the moon and the world's first atomic icebreaker "Lenin" setting sail. The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket, following the trajectory planned by Soviet scientists, hit the moon on the 14th, completing the first flight in history from Earth to another celestial body, thus opening the door for mankind to travel in the brilliant starry sky. The departure of the Soviet atomic icebreaker is another great victory for the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    The outstanding achievement of the Soviet cosmic rocket accurately hitting the moon has won the praise of the world. We know that the moon is more than 384,000 kilometers away from the earth, and it revolves around the earth at a speed of one kilometer per second. The rocket also travels at high speed. Therefore, if the orbit is not extremely accurate, it will be "a miss is as good as a mile." This shows that the Soviet rocket has a very accurate automatic device, which is one of the most important conditions for ensuring space flight. Moreover, the last stage of this rocket weighs 1,511 kilograms (39 kilograms heavier than the first Soviet cosmic rocket launched on January 2, this year), of which the container and instruments weigh 390.2 kilograms. This rocket will provide valuable information about the composition of the space between the earth and the moon, allowing people to accurately determine the content of gas cosmic particles and particles in space. In addition, it also contains a great contribution to the study of the Earth's radiation belt, the Earth's and Moon's magnetic fields, which are of great significance to space flight.

    The Soviet rocket's achievement in flying to the moon has caused different reactions in the Western world. Peace-loving people there feel excited and happy along with people all over the world, and some scientists also admit that the Soviet Union has achieved outstanding achievements in science and technology. However, those who insist on a policy of strength and a cold war policy are frightened. They either pretend to be calm or try to belittle the significance of the Soviet rocket. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd actually said that he did not think many people were very interested in it (referring to the lunar rocket). U.S. Vice President Nixon insisted that there was no evidence that the Soviet rocket hit the moon. These words have become a laughing stock all over the world. But no matter how some people deceive themselves, the facts are as clear as the sun and the moon. Who is ahead and who is behind will be even clearer if compared. In the past year or so, the United States has launched five lunar rockets, four of which met with the fate of either exploding or being burned. Only the last one entered outer space, but the weight of its instruments and containers was less than one-sixtieth of that of the Soviet rocket, only 5.9 kilograms. This once again shows that socialist countries are far ahead in the progress and development of science and technology. Therefore, people regard the achievements of Soviet science as a victory for the socialist system and a victory for the new world.

    The cosmic rocket flying to the moon and the departure of the atomic icebreaker are great examples of Soviet science serving peace. These two events further demonstrate the determination and strength of the Soviet people to uphold the cause of defending peace, and greatly encourage the struggle of people all over the world to eliminate the Cold War and strive for peaceful coexistence among all countries.

    The Only Way to Resolve the Laotian Situation

    Recently, the situation in Laos has become increasingly tense. The United States is not only continuously supplying the Lao Sananikone government with weapons and equipment, continuing to expand the civil war in Laos; but is also embezzling the name of the United Nations to further interfere in the Laotian situation.

    On September 4, the Lao Sananikone government, under the direction of the United States, filed a so-called accusation with the United Nations that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was "invading" Laos, and requested the United Nations to immediately send "emergency forces" to Laos. Then the U.S. State Department issued a statement supporting "the United Nations' consideration of the appeal made by the Royal Government of Laos." On September 8, the United Nations Security Council, ignoring the firm opposition of the Soviet representative, illegally announced the adoption of a proposal submitted by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France to establish a so-called committee to "investigate" the situation in Laos. On September 15, the United Nations "investigation team" composed of Argentina, Italy, Japan, and Tunisia arrived in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, and began "investigation" activities. These facts show that the situation in Laos has been further complicated under the direct intervention of the United States.

    The fact is clear that the United Nations' sending of a so-called "investigation team" is nothing more than a conspiracy by the United States to implement direct military intervention in Laos. According to United Press International, the main purpose of the United States is to force the United Nations to pass a resolution on sending "emergency forces" to Laos, so as to facilitate the United States and members of the Southeast Asia Aggression Group to carry out armed intervention in Laos under the guise of the United Nations. Recently, U.S. military personnel have been flocking into Laos, and military supplies have been continuously imported. U.S. military leaders are even unscrupulously making war cries. Thai Prime Minister Sarit even openly stated that "if Laos requests the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Thailand is ready to send troops to Laos at any time."

    The resolution on interfering in Laotian affairs passed by the United Nations Security Council under the manipulation of the United States not only clearly violates the United Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the Security Council, but is also a naked act of destroying the Geneva Accords. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on September 9, pointing out that the passage of the above resolution was completely illegal. Organizations such as the Indonesian Peace Committee, the Indian-Asian-African Solidarity Committee, and the British Peace Committee have also successively issued statements pointing out that the United Nations' interference in the internal affairs of Laos will only further aggravate the tense situation in Laos.

    In order to restore the situation in the Laotian region to normal, the Soviet government issued another statement on the Laotian situation on September 14, suggesting that a meeting of countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue be convened quickly to discuss the situation formed in Laos. The Chinese government and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also issued statements on September 15 and 16 respectively, fully supporting the Soviet government's peace initiative. As the Soviet statement pointed out, the tense situation in the Laotian region can and should be resolved on the basis and within the scope of the Geneva Accords. Just and fair opinions from countries around the world unanimously believe that the United Nations has no right to interfere in Laos; thoroughly implementing the Geneva Accords is the only way to solve the Laotian issue.

    Oppose France Conducting Nuclear Tests

    On September 7, people from Asian and African countries widely responded to the call from the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council and held mass activities to protest France's nuclear weapons tests.

    Earlier, the French government issued a communique announcing that the French atomic bomb would be tested with a "low-altitude explosion" in the central Sahara Desert in Africa. As soon as this news came out, it immediately aroused great indignation from all peace-loving people in the world, especially people from Asian and African countries. The Asian-African Group of the United Nations has requested that the issue of France's nuclear test in the Sahara be included in the agenda of this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    One of the purposes of the de Gaulle government insisting on conducting nuclear tests is said to be to restore France's "status as a major power." However, in order to possess nuclear weapons, the French government does not hesitate to rely on West German militarists; and the reason why the West German ruling group is so generous in cooperating with France is obviously to facilitate its own stepped-up nuclear armament. It is understandable how dangerous it would be for the fate of France and even the entire world once West German militarists gained control of nuclear weapons.

    The location of France's nuclear weapons test is in Africa, so the African people will bear the brunt of the disaster of France's "atomic policy." If Africa has not been affected by atomic explosions until now, then the African continent is now facing this threat. At the same time, the de Gaulle government is also attempting to intimidate the people of the French colonies in Africa through nuclear tests and suppress the national liberation movements of the colonial people. It is precisely because of this that a wave of protests against France's nuclear tests has recently been launched in various African countries. A representative of the Provisional Government of Algeria said in a speech on September 8 that de Gaulle wanted to test atomic bombs in the Sahara in order to intimidate the Algerian people and at the same time bring new disasters to the people of this region.

    This "atomic policy" of the French de Gaulle government has also been strongly opposed by the French people. The French National Peace Council issued a communique on September 8, calling on all responsible French people to take action together to force the government to abandon its heinous plan to test atomic bombs. The communique pointed out that France could make great progress in its atomic energy science by committing itself to establishing a system of cooperation among countries for the peaceful use of atomic energy. This path can be opened, but if France tests atomic bombs, it will create obstacles in this regard.

    Britain Decides to Hold General Elections Early

    British Prime Minister Macmillan announced on September 8 that the British Parliament would be dissolved on September 18 and a general election would be held on October 8. This election will be the fifth general election in Britain after the war. The last general election was held in May 1955. According to the current British system, the term of Parliament is five years, but why did Macmillan dissolve Parliament early? Macmillan himself said that he decided to hold the election early "from the point of view of domestic affairs" and "based on the international situation." To put it bluntly, he simply believed that the current domestic and international situation in Britain was most conducive to the Conservative Party's attempt to trick the British people into voting for them.

    Since the second half of last year, the Conservative Party has been doing a lot of preparatory work to win votes. On economic policies that are closely related to the lives of the British people, the Conservative government has adopted some measures aimed at temporarily easing the trend of the sharp decline in British industrial production in 1958. In terms of foreign policy, the Conservative government has also taken certain measures aimed at improving Britain's international status. Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union in February this year and his repeated expressions of support for holding an East-West summit are obvious examples.

    From the Conservative Party's point of view, these preparations have achieved certain results. In recent months, due to the artificial stimulation of the production of a few industrial sectors by the financial measures taken, the general index of British industrial production has risen slightly, and the status of the pound is currently relatively stable. The current international situation is trending towards relaxation. Khrushchev's visit to the United States and Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union in late autumn are even more welcomed by people of all countries. Therefore, this is a great opportunity for the Conservative Party to win votes.

    As another major party in Britain, the Labour Party is naturally not willing to lag behind in terms of seizing political capital to cope with the general election. Gaitskell and Bevan followed in Macmillan's footsteps and also visited the Soviet Union from August 29 to September 9. Like the Conservative Party, the Labour Party also touted that its international policy conformed to the requirements of easing the tense situation and that it should represent Britain at future East-West summit conferences. In terms of domestic policy, the Labour Party also routinely claimed to be able to satisfy the wishes of the British people.

    The British general election is, as usual, a trick to play with bourgeois democracy. Whether the Conservative Party comes to power or the Labour Party comes to power, they all serve the interests of the British monopoly bourgeoisie. The representatives of the real working people have very few opportunities to be elected as members of parliament due to various restrictions of the electoral system. However, the competition between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, especially the competition to tout themselves as serving peace in terms of foreign policy, although it has a strong "who is the real Wang Mazi brand" flavor, it fully shows that the demands of the British people are no longer something that any bourgeois party dares to ignore.

    The British Communist Party is actively participating in the general election and has put forward its own candidates and election platform. On foreign policy, the British Communist Party has put forward a series of important proposals, including: Britain stopping nuclear weapons testing and manufacturing, withdrawing U.S. troops and military bases stationed in Britain, signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, ending all colonial wars, and lifting all restrictions on East-West trade. In terms of domestic policy, the British Communist Party has proposed important measures such as increasing wages, building housing, and nationalizing major enterprises. Obviously, the program put forward by the British Communist Party is truly in the interests of the British people.

    半月国际述评
    （9月1日到16日）
    红色火箭飞进月宫
    这几天，全世界人民都兴高采烈地谈论着苏联宇宙火箭飞进月宫和世界上第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”启航的消息。苏联的第二个宇宙火箭，按照苏联科学家预定的轨道，于14日射中月球，完成了在历史上第一次从地球到另一个天体的飞行，从而打开了人类遨游于灿烂星空的大门。苏联原子破冰船的启航，是苏联在和平利用原子能方面又一个伟大的胜利。
    苏联宇宙火箭准确地射中月球的出色成就，博得了全世界的赞叹。我们知道，月球距离地球三十八万四千多公里，它以每秒一公里的速度围绕地球运转，火箭也以高速运行，因此如果轨道不是极其准确，那就会是“失之毫厘，差之千里”的。这说明苏联火箭有着非常准确的自动装置，而这一点正是保证宇宙飞行最重要的条件之一。不仅如此，这个火箭的最后一级重达一千五百一十一公斤（比今年1月2日苏联发射的第一个宇宙火箭还重三十九公斤），其中的容器和仪器即重三百九十点二公斤。这个火箭将提供关于地球和月球之间的空间成分的宝贵情报，使人们精确地确定空间的气体宇宙微粒和粒子的含量。此外，对于研究地球辐射带、地球和月球的磁场，也都含有很大贡献，而这些都是对宇宙飞行具有极重大的意义的。
    苏联火箭飞上月球的成就，在西方世界引起了不同的反应。那里的爱好和平人民同全世界人民一起，感到兴奋愉快，有一些科学家也承认苏联在科学技术方面获得了杰出的成就。但是，那些坚持实力政策和冷战政策的人们却胆战心惊，他们或者故作镇静，或者极力贬低苏联火箭的意义。英国外交大臣劳埃德竟说，他并不认为许多人对它（指月球火箭）极感兴趣。美国副总统尼克松硬说没有证据证明苏联火箭射中了月球。这些话已经传为全世界的笑柄。但不论有人怎样自己欺骗自己，事实毕竟像日月一样明显。谁走在前边，谁落在后边，如果对比一下就更清楚了。一年多来，美国曾经发射过五次月球火箭，其中四个遭到了不是爆炸就是焚毁的命运，只有最后一个进入了宇宙空间，但是其仪器和容器重量还不及苏联火箭的六十分之一，仅有五点九公斤。这再一次说明在科学技术的进步和发展方面，社会主义国家是遥遥领先了。因此，人们把苏联科学的成就看作是社会主义制度的胜利，看作是新世界的胜利。
    宇宙火箭飞上月球和原子破冰船的启航是苏联科学为和平服务的伟大典范。这两件事进一步表现了苏联人民坚持保卫和平事业的决心和力量，大大鼓舞了全世界人民争取消除冷战和争取各国人民和平共处的斗争。
    解决老挝局势的唯一途径
    最近，老挝的局势日趋紧张。美国不仅源源不断地供给老挝萨纳尼空政府武器和装备，继续扩大老挝的内战；并且正在盗用联合国的名义，进一步干涉老挝局势。
    9月4日，老挝萨纳尼空政府，在美国的指使下，向联合国提出所谓越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝的诬告，要求联合国立即派遣“紧急部队”到老挝。接着美国国务院发表声明，支持“联合国考虑老挝王国政府提出的呼吁”。9月8日，联合国安全理事会竟不顾苏联代表的坚决反对，非法地宣布通过美、英、法三国代表提出的关于成立所谓“调查”老挝局势委员会的提案。9月15日，由阿根廷、意大利、日本和突尼斯组成的联合国“调查小组”抵达老挝的首都万象，开始进行“调查”活动。这些事实表明，老挝的局势在美国的直接干预下，已经进一步复杂化了。
    事实很清楚，联合国派出所谓“调查小组”，不过是美国对老挝实行直接军事干涉的一个阴谋步骤。据合众国际社透露，美国的主要目的在于迫使联合国通过关于派遣“紧急部队”到老挝的决议，以便于美国和东南亚侵略集团成员国在联合国的幌子下对老挝进行武装干涉。最近，美国的军事人员络绎不绝地进入老挝，军事物资也源源不断地输入。美国的军事首脑更肆无忌惮地发出一片战争叫嚣。泰国总理乃沙立甚至公开表示，“如果老挝向东南亚条约组织提出要求的话，泰国随时都准备向老挝派遣军队。”
    联合国安全理事会在美国操纵下通过的干预老挝事务的决议，不仅明显地违反联合国宪章和安全理事会的议事规程，而且是赤裸裸地破坏日内瓦协议的行为。越南民主共和国外交部于9月9日发表声明，指出上述决议的通过是完全非法的。印度尼西亚和平委员会、印度亚非团结委员会、英国和平委员会等团体也相继发表声明，指出联合国对老挝内政的干涉，只会进一步加剧老挝的紧张局势。
    为了使老挝地区的局势恢复正常，苏联政府在9月14日再一次就老挝局势发表声明，建议迅速召集参加1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的国家开会，来讨论在老挝所形成的局势。中国政府和越南民主共和国政府也先后在9月15日和16日发表声明，完全支持苏联政府的和平倡议。正如苏联声明所指出，老挝地区产生的紧张局势能够而且应当在日内瓦协议的基础上和范围内求得解决。世界各国的公正舆论一致认为，联合国无权干涉老挝；彻底贯彻日内瓦协议，乃是解决老挝问题的唯一途径。
    反对法国进行核试验
    9月7日，亚非各国人民广泛地响应亚非人民团结理事会书记处的号召，举行了抗议法国试验核武器的群众性活动。
    早些时候，法国政府发表公报，宣布法国的原子弹将在非洲的撒哈拉沙漠的中部进行“低空爆炸”试验。这一消息传出后，立即引起了全世界一切爱好和平的人民，特别是亚非人民的极大愤慨。联合国亚非集团已经要求把法国将在撒哈拉进行核试验问题列入本届联合国大会会议的议程。
    戴高乐政府坚持要进行核试验的目的之一，据说是为了恢复法国的“大国地位”。但是为了拥有核子武器，法国政府竟不惜投靠西德军国主义者；而西德统治集团之所以如此慷慨地同法国合作，显然是为了便于自己加紧进行核子武装。可以理解，西德军国主义分子一旦掌握了核武器，对于法国以至整个世界的命运，将是怎样的危险。
    法国试验核武器的地点是在非洲，因此非洲人民将首当其冲，遭受法国“原子政策”的灾害。如果说，直到目前为止，非洲还没有受到原子爆炸的影响，那末，现在非洲大陆已面临着这种威胁。同时戴高乐政府也企图通过核试验恫吓非洲法国殖民地的人民，镇压殖民地人民的民族解放运动。正是因为这样，所以最近以来非洲各国掀起了抗议法国进行核试验的浪潮。阿尔及利亚临时政府代表在9月8日发表谈话指出，戴高乐要在撒哈拉试验原子弹是为了恐吓阿尔及利亚人民，同时将给这一地区的人民带来新的灾难。
    法国戴高乐政府的这种“原子政策”同样遭到法国人民的强烈反对。法国全国和平理事会9月8日发表公报，号召一切有责任感的法国人一起行动，迫使政府放弃试验原子弹的罪恶计划。公报指出，法国可以使它的原子能科学获得巨大的进展，这就要致力于在各国之间建立和平利用原子能的合作制度。这条道路是可以打开的，但是，如果法国试验原子弹，就将造成这方面的障碍。
    英国决定提早大选
    英国首相麦克米伦于9月8日宣布，英国议会将于9月18日解散，10月8日举行大选。这次大选将是英国战后第五次大选。上次大选是在1955年5月举行的，根据英国现行的制度，议会任期为五年，而麦克米伦却提前解散议会，这是为什么呢？麦克米伦自己说他是“从国内事务观点”和“根据国际局势”而决定提早大选的，其实说得明白一点，无非是他认为目前英国国内外的形势最有利于保守党向英国人民骗取选票而已。
    自从去年下半年以来，保守党就一直在为骗取选票而做了许多准备工作。在同英国人民生活迫切有关的经济政策上，保守党政府采取了一些目的在于暂时缓和1958年英国工业生产猛烈下降的趋势的措施。在外交政策方面，保守党政府也采取了某些目的在于提高英国国际地位的做法，麦克米伦今年2月的访问苏联和他的一再表示赞成召开东西方首脑会议，就是明显的例子。
    从保守党的观点来看，这些准备工作取得了一定的成效。最近几个月来，由于所采取的财政措施人为地刺激了少数工业部门的生产，英国工业生产的总指数略有上升，英镑的地位目前也还比较稳定。目前国际局势是趋向缓和的，赫鲁晓夫的访美之行以及秋末艾森豪威尔的访问苏联，更是受各国人民的欢迎。因此，这对保守党是一个骗取选票的大好时机。
    作为英国另一大党的工党，在为应付大选而捞取政治资本这一方面自然也不甘落后。盖茨克尔和比万在8月29日—9月9日步麦克米伦的后尘也访问了苏联。像保守党一样，工党也吹嘘它的国际政策符合于缓和紧张局势的要求，应该由它来代表英国出席未来的东西方首脑会议。在国内政策方面，工党也照例自命能满足英国人民的愿望。
    英国的大选是照例的一场玩弄资产阶级民主的把戏，不论是保守党上台还是工党上台，它们都是为英国垄断资产阶级的利益服务的。真正的劳动人民的代表则由于选举制度的种种限制，极少当选议员的机会。但是保守党和工党之间的竞选，特别是在外交政策方面竞相标榜为和平服务，虽然颇有“谁是真正老牌王麻子”的味道，却也充分说明了英国人民的要求已经不是任何资产阶级政党敢于忽视的了。
    英国共产党以积极的态度参加大选，提出了自己的候选人和竞选纲领。在外交政策上，英共提出了一系列重要的主张，其中包括：英国停止核武器的试验与制造，撤销美国驻在英国的军队和军事基地，与苏联签订互不侵犯条约，结束一切殖民战争，解除对东西方贸易的一切禁令。在国内政策方面，英共提出增加工资、修建住宅、把主要企业收归国有等重要措施。很显然，英共所提出的纲领是真正符合于英国人民的利益的。
