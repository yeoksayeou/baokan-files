    "America Walks in Front"
　  Chi Bei'ou
    The Soviet Union sent the first rocket to the moon,
    Once again proving that the Soviet Union is far ahead in the race.
    But Nixon said without blushing:
    "We are walking in front of the Soviets."
    Some people in the United States have long boasted that they will be the first to occupy the moon,
    They want to turn the moon into the 49th state of the United States;
    Some people have even pre-sold land on the moon,
    In these aspects, the United States is indeed far ahead.
    As for the number of failed rocket launches,
    The United States also maintains the highest record.
    When red rockets successfully soar into the sky one after another,
    American goods return to the underworld time and time again.
    In order to prove that the United States is indeed "walking in front,"
    Washington hurriedly put on another brilliant performance,
    The Soviet rocket took more than a day to reach the moon,
    The American rocket reached the "finish line" in just ten seconds.

    “美国走在前面”
　  池北偶
    苏联往月亮送到了第一支火箭，
    再一次证明苏联在竞赛中遥遥领先。
    但是尼克松却毫不脸红地说：
    “我们走在苏联人的前面”。
    美国早就有人夸口将最先占领月球，
    他们要把月亮变为美国的第四十九州；
    还有人预先发卖了月球上的地皮，
    在这些方面美国确是远远走在前头。
    至于发射火箭失败的次数，
    美国也是保持着最高的纪录。
    当红色火箭一个又一个顺利上天，
    美国的货色却一回又一回进入地府。
    为了证明美国的确“走在前面”，
    华盛顿又赶忙作了一次精采表演，
    苏联的火箭走了一天多才碰上月球，
    美国的火箭却十秒钟就到了“终点”。
