The National Games volleyball finals have already completed thirty-six matches by the 16th. Every match was tense and fierce, with the situation changing rapidly. Ten matches ended with a score of three to two, and twelve matches had a score of three to one. Moreover, the scores in many sets were quite close.

From the men's teams' perspective: On the first day of the competition, the champions and runners-up of last year's national Grade A League, the People's Liberation Army team and the Guangdong team, were defeated by the Jiangxi team and the Liaoning team, respectively. Three of the four regional preliminary champions were defeated. On the second day, the Jiangxi team and the Liaoning team were defeated by the Shanghai team and the Jilin team, respectively. The fourth champion from the regional preliminaries, the Hubei team, also lost to the Jiangsu team. On the third day, the Jiangxi team defeated the Guangdong team with a score of three to two. In just three days, the champions and runners-up of the four regional preliminary rounds of the men's teams have all been defeated in one or two matches. The only teams that remain undefeated are the Jilin team and the Jiangsu team, who finished third in their respective regional preliminaries.

In the women's team competition, there were also unexpected results. The Guangdong women's team, which finished sixth in last year's Grade B League, defeated the Guizhou team, which finished eighth in the Grade A League, with a score of three to two. The Liaoning team, which lost to the Shanghai team in the Nanjing competition zone preliminaries and finished as runner-up, defeated the Shanghai team in return.

The situation in the first three days of the competition reflects the tremendous progress that China's volleyball sport has made in recent years, especially since the regional preliminaries. Great importance has been given to powerful serves and receiving serves, and athletes are launching attacks from the serve. Tactically, the game has gradually developed from a single back-row attack to attacking twice after moving up to the front row. Blocking techniques have improved rapidly. In terms of collective tactics, diversified formations have replaced the simple horseshoe shape. Due to the widespread adoption of diving saves, floor saves have also been greatly strengthened. The improvement in the technical level of volleyball is not reflected in just one or a few teams, but is a general improvement. Therefore, the situation where one team maintains an absolute advantage is no longer possible. Similar levels and equal strength have become important characteristics on the volleyball court today. Precisely because the teams are at similar levels and evenly matched, the outcome of each match in the first three days often depends not only on strategy and tactics, but also on enthusiasm and will, that is, whether they have the spirit of going all out and striving for the top. Teams with strong enthusiasm and tenacious fighting spirit can play to their potential. Conversely, if they are preoccupied with gains and losses, nervous on the court, or underestimate their opponents, and are not calm enough after losing, they may be defeated by their opponents when they are close to victory. In the match between the PLA men's team and the Jiangxi team, the PLA team initially won two consecutive sets, and it seemed that victory was already in hand, but the Jiangxi team remained calm and determined, and won three consecutive sets, reversing the defeat. In the match between the Guangdong team and the Liaoning team, the Liaoning team played bravely and tenaciously, and surprisingly defeated the Guangdong team by a considerable margin.

Looking at the Jiangxi men's team, although this team finished ninth in last year's national Grade A League and third in the regional preliminaries after losing to the Guangdong team, this time they went all out and defeated the People's Liberation Army team and the Guangdong team, the champions and runners-up of the Grade A League, in succession. Moreover, both wins came after five sets of repeated competition, and they finally reversed the defeats. This shows that a game is not only a competition of technique and physical strength, but also a fierce battle of confidence, enthusiasm, firm will, and tenacious style.

The competition in these three days also showed that many new players with more comprehensive skills have emerged in various teams. Zhang Liwei, number nine of the Guizhou women's volleyball team, is only sixteen years old this year and has been participating in competitions for just over a year, but she can spike with both her left and right hands, and her attacks are both fierce and ruthless. The new players of the Sichuan women's team are also an important force threatening their opponents.

In short, the achievements of the first three days of the volleyball finals are satisfactory. Most teams have played to their expected level. Now, the teams are redoubling their efforts and improving their tactics. It can be expected that the remaining sixty-nine matches will be even more exciting and intense.

    旗鼓相当　争夺激烈
    全运会排球决赛前三天述评
    全国运动会排球决赛到16日已经进行了三十六场比赛。场场打得紧张、激烈，形势瞬息万变。有十场结果打成三比二，十二场的比数是三比一。而且许多场的各局的比数都相当接近。
    从男队来看：比赛第一天，去年全国甲级队联赛的冠军解放军队和亚军广东队就双双败给江西队和辽宁队，四个分区预赛冠军中，有三个被击败。第二天，江西队和辽宁队又双双败于上海队和吉林队，分区预赛中的第四个冠军——湖北队也败于江苏队之手。第三天，江西队又以三比二打败广东队。刚刚三天，男子队四个分区预赛的冠、亚军都被打败过一场到两场。保持不败的只有分区预赛第三名的吉林队和江苏队。
    女队的比赛中也有出人意料的结果。去年乙级联赛第六名的广东女队，以三比二击败了甲级队第八名的贵州队。分区预赛中败给上海队而居南京竞赛区亚军的辽宁队，又反手拿下了上海队。
    前三天的比赛形势，反映了我国排球运动在最近几年中，特别是分区预赛以来巨大的进步。大力发球和接发球得到了普遍重视，运动员从发球就开展进攻。战术上也已经从单一的后排插上逐步发展向插上后再进攻两次球。拦网技术有了很快提高。集体战术上，多样化形式代替了单纯的马蹄形，由于鱼跃救球的普遍采用，摔救也大大加强了。排球技术水平的提高不是反映在某一个或某几个队中，而是普遍提高，因此，过去一个队保持绝对优势的状况也不再成为可能。水平相近，旗鼓相当就成为今天排球场上的重要特征了。正因为各队水平相近，旗鼓相当，前三天比赛中每一场球的胜负就往往不单纯决定于战略战术，还决定于干劲和意志，即是否具有鼓足干劲，力争上游的精神。是干劲足，斗争性顽强的队，就能打出水平。反之，如果斤斤计较得失，临场紧张，或轻视对方，输球后又不够沉着，很可能在接近胜利的时候，被对方反败为胜。解放军男队对江西队的一场比赛，解放军队最初连胜两局，看来胜利已经在握，但江西队沉着坚定，不慌不乱，连续扳回三局，反败为胜。广东队对辽宁队之战，辽宁队打得勇敢顽强，居然以相当悬殊的比数战胜了广东队。
    从江西男队来看，这个队虽然是去年全国甲级队联赛第九名，分区预赛时败给广东队居第三名，但这次却一鼓作气，连续打败甲级队联赛冠军解放军队和亚军广东队。而且都是经过五局的反复争夺，最后反败为胜的。这就说明了一场球赛不仅是比技术、比体力，而且是比信心、比干劲、比坚定意志和顽强作风的剧烈战斗。
    这三天的竞赛中还可看出，各队出现不少技术较全面的新手。贵州女排九号张丽维，虽然今年才十六岁，参加比赛不过一年多，但却能左右手扣杀，打得既猛且狠。四川女队的新手也是威胁对方的一支重要力量。
    总之，排球决赛前三天的成就是令人满意的。大部分队都打出了预期的水平。现在，各队正再鼓干劲，改进战术，可以期望今后的六十九场比赛中，将打得更精彩、更炽烈。
