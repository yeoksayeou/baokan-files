Bulgaria in Great Leap Forward

    Top picture: The Bulgarian people are actively expanding cultivated areas and have achieved great results. This is a scene of members of the Opanez Agricultural Cooperative in the Pleven region building terraces to obtain grain from barren mountains.

    Right picture: Bulgarian youth enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party and the government, participating in youth labor shock brigades to increase the country's wealth. This shows two female middle school students participating in voluntary labor in an agricultural cooperative, adding feed to dairy cows.

    Left picture: In Bulgaria, new residences are being built in both urban and rural areas. This is the newly built Zaimov residential area in Sofia, with tall and bright houses, surrounded by green grass, where children are happily strolling.

    Bottom picture: Bulgarian industry is advancing by leaps and bounds. In 1958, the total industrial output value increased by about eight times compared to the pre-war year of 1939. This is the Maritsa Iztok Thermal Power Station under construction.
