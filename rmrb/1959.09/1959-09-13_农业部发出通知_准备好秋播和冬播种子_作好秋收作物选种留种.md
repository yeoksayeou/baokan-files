Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 10th, requiring all regions to seize the opportunity, make good arrangements, rely on the masses, and conscientiously do a good job in preparing autumn (winter) sowing seeds and selecting and retaining seeds of autumn harvest crops.

The notice said that according to recent reports from various regions, the majority of provinces (regions, cities) have basically prepared enough wheat seeds, but there are still imbalances between counties, communes, and teams within the provinces (regions, cities). Therefore, it is still very important to mobilize the masses to exchange and adjust to ensure quantity. First, the people's communes and production teams are required to conduct a thorough survey, and those that have been surveyed should promptly adjust and exchange, and implement them according to the sowing plan and variety allocation. If there is a shortage, the government should strive to adjust and supplement it in time. There are also shortages of broad bean, winter barley, and green manure seeds, which should be solved by tapping local potential.

Before autumn sowing, seed selection, germination tests, and seed treatment must be carried out. Particular attention should be paid to the selection of seeds used from grain.

This year, the high-quality seeds selected from ears (plants) during the summer harvest should be sown in seed fields to breed high-purity improved varieties for use in large fields next year. The single-ear (single-plant) seeds selected during the summer harvest that have large ears and many grains should be sown in variety test fields according to variety and different traits, and according to the number of grains per ear. Single plants with particularly excellent traits should also be planted separately, carefully cultivated, and compared to further select excellent new varieties.

The notice requires all regions to conscientiously do a good job in selecting and retaining seeds of autumn harvest crops. The notice pointed out that, according to general understanding, the phenomenon of mixed varieties of autumn harvest crops is still widespread and relatively serious. In some improved variety propagation fields, seed fields, or experimental fields, the varieties are not pure enough. It is necessary to strictly remove impurities and inferior plants in the fields and land, or select well-growing plots of crops for impurity removal or mixed selection. The purity should generally reach over 90%. During harvesting, single threshing and single harvesting must be resolutely implemented to avoid mixing. Due to the wide area of water and drought disasters this year, the growth of autumn harvest crops in many areas has been affected, and the seeds are less full. Special attention should be paid to selecting plots that have been less affected by the disaster and are well-matured for seed retention. If it is indeed a crop failure and seeds cannot be retained, the government should designate disaster-free or lightly affected areas to retain seeds on behalf of the affected areas for supply. The notice put forward specific requirements for the quantity of seed retention, the selection of seeds for next year's seed fields, and seed storage.

    农业部发出通知准备好秋播和冬播种子
    作好秋收作物选种留种
    新华社12日讯　农业部10日发出通知，要求各地抓紧时机，作好安排，依靠群众，认真作好秋（冬）播种子准备和秋收作物选种留种工作。
    通知说，据各地最近反映，绝大部分省（区、市）准备的小麦种子已经基本够用，但省（区、市）内县与县、社与社、队与队之间仍有不平衡现象。因此，发动群众互换调剂，确保数量，还应当十分重视。首先要求人民公社、生产队要认真进行普查，已普查的抓紧调剂互换，按播种计划和品种配置，落实下来。如有不足，再由政府争取时间调剂补足。蚕豌豆、冬大麦和绿肥种子，也都有不足情况，应就地挖掘潜力解决。
    在秋种前必须进行种子精选、发芽试验和种子处理工作。特别是从粮食中选用的种子，更要注意精选工作。
    今年在夏收中穗（株）选出来的质量较好的种子，要播在种子地（田）内，以便为下年的大田用种繁殖出纯度高的良种。夏收中选出的穗大、粒多的单穗（单株）种子应当分品种，按不同性状，并按每穗粒数多寡分别播在品种试验田内，具有特殊优良性状的单株还应当单独种植，加意精心培育，观察比较，以期进一步选出优良的新品种。
    通知要求各地必须认真作好秋收作物的选种留种工作。通知指出，根据一般了解，秋收作物品种混杂现象仍是普遍而较为严重的。有的良种繁殖田，种子地（田）或试验田内，品种也不够纯。应在场、田、地内严格进行去杂去劣或选定作物生长好的地块，进行去杂或混合选种，纯度一般应达到90％以上。收获时要坚决实行单打、单收，避免混杂。由于今年水、旱灾害的面较广，不少地区秋收作物生长受到影响，种子饱满程度较差，留种时应特别注意挑选受灾轻的，成熟好的地块，如确系失收不能留种的，政府应指定无灾或轻灾区，代为留种供应。通知对留种数量、明年种子地（田）用种的选留工作和种子保管工作都提出了具体要求。
