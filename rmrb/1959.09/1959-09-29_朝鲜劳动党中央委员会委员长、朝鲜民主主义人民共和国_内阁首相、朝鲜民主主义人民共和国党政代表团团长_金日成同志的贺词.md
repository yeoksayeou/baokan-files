Dear Comrades and Friends:

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I extend the warmest congratulations to the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic, and the fraternal Chinese people on behalf of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the government and the entire Korean people.

    The founding of the People's Republic of China is a great victory won by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China through a long and arduous revolutionary struggle against foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries.

    The Chinese people, who have been oppressed for thousands of years, have since firmly grasped sovereignty and embarked on the road of creating a new socialist life. The old China, plundered and oppressed by imperialists, landlords, and bureaucrat-capitalists, is gone forever; a new socialist China has ascended the world stage.

    The victory of the Chinese revolution has opened up broad prospects for hundreds of millions of Asian people to shake off the shackles of imperialism and strive for national independence and social progress.

    The victory of the Chinese revolution has given a huge impetus and encouragement to the people of Asian and worldwide colonies and dependent countries, promoting the final collapse of the imperialist colonial system.

    The birth and development of a powerful socialist China has greatly strengthened the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    The decade since the founding of the People's Republic of China has been a period of great social change and great construction unprecedented in China's thousands of years of history.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution in a short period of time.

    Today, the 650 million Chinese people are launching the Great Leap Forward movement in socialist construction, and their unprecedented revolutionary drive and labor enthusiasm are boiling on the vast land of China.

    Thanks to the heroic labor of the Chinese working class, China's industrial production increased approximately tenfold from 1950 to 1958.

    In the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, the people's commune movement, which unfolded as powerfully as a raging fire, inspired the soaring enthusiasm and creativity and initiative of hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants, further promoting the development of agricultural productivity.

    Now, the working people of all of China, in order to complete the production targets of major industrial and agricultural products stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule this year, are further exerting their efforts and continuing to wage a tenacious struggle.

    All the Chinese people are united as one, like steel, around the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and are full of firm confidence in the victory of the great and just cause they are undertaking.

    The Korean people are convinced that the fraternal Chinese people, under the illumination of the general line for socialist construction put forward by the Communist Party of China, will surely achieve new and greater successes in the Great Leap Forward movement and the people's commune movement.

    Both the victory of the Chinese revolution and all the achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction are a testament to the great victory of Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party of China and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, have not only creatively applied the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, consistently guiding the Chinese people towards victory, but are also making great contributions to further developing Marxist-Leninist theory and enriching the experience of the international communist movement.

    The People's Republic of China has played and is playing a huge role in strengthening the power and unity of the socialist bloc headed by the Soviet Union, and in defending peace in Asia and the world.

    The Korean people are as happy about all the achievements made by the Chinese people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction as if they were their own. Our people often learn from your achievements and experience, and are greatly encouraged by them. Now, under the leadership of our Party, the Korean people are making tremendous achievements in socialist construction.

    Our country has completed the socialist transformation of the relations of production, and the productive forces are developing rapidly. Our working class has carried out selfless labor and completed the industrial gross output value plan of the First Five-Year Plan in two and a half years.

    The cause of socialist construction in our country is rising day by day, and all the working people, with the spirit of riding a thousand-ri horse, are continuing to stride powerfully towards the peak of socialism.

    China's Great Leap Forward movement and our country's Chollima movement demonstrate the indomitable will and boundless creativity displayed by the people who have been liberated from exploitation and oppression and have become masters of their own destiny in creating a new life.

    All the victories and achievements made by the Korean people in their arduous struggle contain the great assistance of the people of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, including the noble assistance of the fraternal Chinese people.

    During the most difficult period of the Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people against the armed aggression of the US imperialists, the Chinese people dispatched volunteers to aid us with their blood. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people displayed unparalleled heroism in the battle against the enemy, ensuring our victory and establishing great merits.

    The Chinese people have given great economic assistance to our people's post-war reconstruction and continue to provide great assistance to our socialist construction.

    I take this opportunity, on behalf of the entire Korean people, to once again express my deep gratitude to the Chinese people for their noble assistance to us.

    The close mutual assistance and cooperation in the common struggle against aggression and in socialist construction link the friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples like a firm bond.

    The friendship and unity between the peoples of our two countries are forged in blood and tested in arduous struggles.

    The friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples is based on the unity of thought and struggle goals, and is a relationship of complete equality and mutual assistance established in accordance with the principles of proletarian internationalism. This friendship is developing and further consolidating in the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    Historical experience tells us that no force can destroy the friendship established between the Korean and Chinese peoples, and their united strength is invincible.

    Today, the US imperialists continue to occupy the southern half of our country, turning the southern half into a US military base in preparation for launching a new war. This not only hinders the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but also seriously threatens peace in the Far East.

    The Korean people love peace and are fighting for the peaceful reunification of their country.

    Our people, who have received the active support and solidarity of the people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other socialist countries, will surely achieve final victory in their just struggle.

    In the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the Korean people will forever advance alongside the Chinese people and fight for our common great cause.

    Long live the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the Communist Party of China and the great Chinese people!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity of the peoples of Korea and China!

    Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live world peace! (Attached picture)

    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国
    内阁首相、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国党政代表团团长
    金日成同志的贺词亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    在庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年的时候，我以朝鲜劳动党中央委员会、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民的名义，向中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和兄弟的中国人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    中华人民共和国的成立，是中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，为反对外来帝国主义和国内反动派而进行长期的艰苦的革命斗争所取得的伟大胜利。
    千百年来受压迫的中国人民，从此以后牢牢地掌握了主权，走上了创造社会主义新生活的道路。受帝国主义者、地主和官僚资本家掠夺和压迫的旧中国已经一去不复返了；新的社会主义的中国登上了世界舞台。
    中国革命的胜利，为几万万亚洲人民摆脱帝国主义的枷锁、争取民族独立和社会进步的道路开辟了广阔的前途。
    中国革命的胜利，给亚洲和全世界殖民地附属国人民以巨大的推动和鼓舞，促进了帝国主义殖民地体系的最后崩溃。
    强大的社会主义中国的诞生和发展，大大加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力。
    中华人民共和国成立后的十年，是在中国几千年的历史中找不到前例的、伟大的社会变革和伟大的建设的时期。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在短时期内取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利。
    今天，六亿五千万中国人民展开着社会主义建设的大跃进运动，他们空前的革命干劲和劳动热情正在辽阔的中国大地上沸腾着。
    由于中国工人阶级的英勇的劳动，中国的工业生产在1950到1958年期间增长了约十倍。
    在社会主义建设的大跃进过程中，像熊熊大火一般有力展开的人民公社运动，鼓起了几亿中国农民的冲天干劲和创造性、积极性，更加推动了农业生产力的发展。
    现在，全中国的劳动人民，为了在今年内提前两年完成第二个五年计划所规定的主要工业品和农产品的生产指标，进一步鼓足干劲继续进行着顽强的斗争。
    全体中国人民钢铁般地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的周围，对自己所进行的伟大的正义的事业充满着坚强的胜利信心。
    朝鲜人民确信，兄弟的中国人民在中国共产党提出的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，在大跃进运动和人民公社运动中必将取得新的更大的成就。
    中国革命的胜利和中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的一切成果，都是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利。中国共产党和它的领袖毛泽东同志，不仅把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理创造性地运用到中国革命的具体实践中，一贯引导中国人民走向胜利，而且正在进一步发展马克思列宁主义理论和丰富国际共产主义运动的经验方面作出很大的贡献。
    中华人民共和国为了加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力和团结，为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平，已经起了而且正在起着巨大的作用。
    朝鲜人民对中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的一切成就感到像自己的成就一样高兴。我国人民经常学习你们的成就和经验，从中得到很大的鼓舞。现在，朝鲜人民在我们党的领导下正在社会主义建设中取得巨大的成就。
    我国已经完成了生产关系的社会主义改造，生产力正在以飞快的速度向前发展。我国的工人阶级进行了忘我的劳动，用两年半的时间完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划。
    我国社会主义建设事业日益高涨，全体劳动人民正以跨上千里马的气概，朝着社会主义的高峰继续有力地迈进。
    中国的大跃进运动和我国的千里马运动，显示出从剥削和压迫中解放出来而成为自己命运的主人的人民，在创造新生活中所发挥的不屈的斗志和无穷无尽的创造力。
    朝鲜人民在自己的艰苦斗争中所取得的一切胜利与成就中，包含着以苏联为首的社会主义国家人民的巨大援助，其中也包含着兄弟的中国人民的高贵的援助。
    在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义者武装侵略的祖国解放战争的最艰难的时期里，中国人民派遣了志愿军用鲜血援助了我们。中国人民的优秀儿女在对敌人的战斗中发挥了无比的英勇精神，为保证我们的胜利和建立了伟大的功勋。
    中国人民对我国人民的战后恢复建设给予了莫大的经济援助，并且继续对我国的社会主义建设给予巨大的援助。
    我利用这个机会，以全体朝鲜人民的名义向中国人民再一次表示深切的谢意，感谢中国人民对我们的高贵的援助。
    在反对侵略的共同斗争和社会主义建设中的紧密的互助合作，像一条坚牢的纽带，联结了朝中两国人民的友谊。
    我们两国人民之间的友谊和团结，是用鲜血凝成的，并且是在艰苦的斗争中经过考验的。
    朝中两国人民的友谊，是基于思想和斗争目标的一致性，并且是按照无产阶级国际主义原则建立的完全平等和互相援助的关系。这种友谊正在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的大家庭中得到发展和进一步的巩固。
    历史的经验告诉我们，任何力量也破坏不了朝中人民之间所建立的这种友谊，他们的团结力量是不可战胜的。
    今天，美帝国主义者继续强占着我们祖国的南半部，把南半部变为准备发动新战争的美国军事基地。这不仅阻碍朝鲜问题的和平解决，而且严重地威胁着远东的和平。
    朝鲜人民热爱和平，为祖国的和平统一而进行着斗争。
    得到伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和所有其他社会主义国家的人民的积极支持和声援的我国人民，一定会在自己的正义斗争中取得最后的胜利。
    在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的大家庭中，朝鲜人民将永远同中国人民一道前进，为我们的共同的伟大事业而斗争。
    中华人民共和国建国十周年万岁！
    中国共产党和伟大的中国人民万岁！
    朝中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
