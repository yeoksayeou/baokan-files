"The Wall and the Horse" Offers a Fresh Perspective
     Jian Hui
    Someone once asked a writer: "Why do you always write about the male and female protagonists in your works only up to the point of moonlit flowers?" The writer replied, "Writing further would just be mundane life – having children, arguing, and getting angry."
    However, the Kunqu opera "The Wall and the Horse" recently performed in Beijing surprisingly did not stop the depiction of Pei Shaojun and Li Qianjun at the wall and the horse. The wall and the horse are merely a prelude, with more focus on the deep love between the couple in their later daily life. This love story indeed breaks the norm somewhat, and breaks it well.
    The story of this play is very common, and those plots are almost all familiar to everyone, such as: falling in love at first sight, responding with poetry, eloping in private, being disowned by the parents-in-law, living in exile in a nunnery, passing the imperial examination, and a family reunion. When I say this, it is easy to be misunderstood as a clichéd tale of talented scholars and beautiful women, filled with joy and sorrow. But what is valuable is that although it has such plots, it is not that kind of play.
    Take Li Qianjun as an example: she is a never-affected daughter of a wealthy family. She saw a young man on the wall, and the young man sent her a poem. She accepted it without concealment and invited him to her home. The young man was seen in the garden by her wet nurse. The wet nurse scolded the young man for being frivolous and also scolded the maid for arranging the meeting. At this time, Li Qianjun directly admitted to the wet nurse: "He is not a fairy wandering into Tiantai, but I threw fruit from the wall to attract him myself."
    Yan Huizhu aptly portrayed the straightforwardness of this daughter of a wealthy family. Yingying's reliance on Jian, and Wuniang's hesitation, are all good character portrayals, but it would not be realistic to put the plots of relying on Jian and hesitating on Li Qianjun. When shaping this image, Yan Huizhu obviously did not only consider the common characteristics of women in the feudal era, but she fully paid attention to the specific character of this person.
    We have seen many images like Zhang Gong and Romeo in novels and dramas, but the character of Pei Shaojun is not common; he was very brave when eloping in private, but he did not dare to tell his father for many years after bringing his wife home. It would be unfair to say that he is not sincere enough. In order to personally take care of his wife's postpartum life, he was willing to give up fame and not go to the exam. He took the three hundred taels of silver his father gave him for the exam, went out the front door, came in through the back door, and waited until his wife was a month old before going out through the back door again, coming in through the front door, and kneeling to see his father, making up a lie that he failed the exam. This Pei talent, who was praised as a child prodigy and full of talent since childhood, was willing to admit that he had no ink in his chest and did not seek progress for his Li Qianjun, and was scolded and beaten by his father. Isn't this sincere enough?
    But precisely because he has always been his father's good son, the person his father is proud of, and not like Jia Baoyu, who had a rebellious character from childhood, he was very hesitant to explain this unapproved marriage. He fantasized that one day he could openly reveal this matter peacefully. When this fantasy could not be realized, he followed the usual practice.
    The author is somewhat critical of this character. For example, when his father discovered this secret, he was furious and immediately forced his son to write a letter of divorce. Pei Shaojun could not resist his father after all and wrote the letter of divorce. Although he angrily threw the letter of divorce to his father after writing it. In "Selected Yuan Dramas", Bai Renfu even had Pei Shaojun ride a horse to send his "divorced" wife a journey behind his father's back after writing the letter of divorce. These additional strokes are of course very necessary, because he wrote the letter of divorce out of compulsion; but the letter of divorce was written after all. Compared to Li Qianjun, he really lacks the courage of a great man. Therefore: "What a talented狀元公(person who came first in the imperial examination) , writing such a good letter of divorce!"
    Yu Zhenfei vividly shaped such a somewhat cowardly and sincere gentleman. This is a very difficult role to play. If this aspect is emphasized, he may be like Zhang Gong; if that aspect is emphasized, he may be like Jiao Zhongqing in "Peacock Flies Southeast". It is rare for an artist to grasp this character and the comedy of this play so accurately.
    Hua Chuanhao is a famous clown in Kunqu Opera. In this play, he plays a very humorous servant. On the one hand, he helps Pei and Li get married, and on the other hand, he blames them for being absurd; and often from the complaints, he reveals his love for this young couple. When Pei Xingjian became suspicious of the strange children and young woman in the back garden, he spread his wings like an old hen to protect these chicks, describing Qianjun and Duanduan and Chongyang as neighbors who had nothing to do with the Pei family; but when Li Qianjun stepped forward to reveal the secret, he tried his best to make this marriage sound like a match made in heaven in front of the old Shangshu. Hua Chuanhao portrayed a very cute old servant in this play, and he formed a sharp contrast with Pei Shangshu in the play.
    The adaptation of this script is also quite successful. In the original work, the image of Pei Shaojun is relatively inferior. The first act of the original work is the encounter between Pei and Li on the wall and the horse; the second act is the secret meeting; the third act is seven years later, when Pei Shangshu discovers his secret daughter-in-law. The whole play does not positively show the love between Pei Shaojun and Li Qianjun after their marriage, so when he wrote the letter of divorce, this image was very unlovable in the original work. The adaptation only added a paragraph: "Going out the front door and coming in through the back door; then going out the back door and coming in the front door." This changed the spiritual outlook of this character, so the audience did not think he was unfaithful because he wrote the letter of divorce. It can be said that the adapter gave Pei Shaojun's image a necessary and excellent supplement.

    “墙头马上”别开生面
     简慧
    曾经有人问一位作家：“你为什么总是把作品中的男女主人公写到月下花前为止？”这位作家回答说：“再写下去无非是些世俗生活——生儿育女，吵嘴呕气。”
    而最近来北京演出的昆曲“墙头马上”却出人意外的并没有把裴少俊、李倩君的描写停留在墙头马上。墙头马上只是一个楔子，更多的还是写他们久后日常生活中那种深挚的夫妇之情。这个爱情戏的确有些打破常规，而且破得很好。
    这个戏的故事很常见，并且那些情节几乎都是大家熟悉的，比如：一见倾心、诗词答对、私订终身、深夜出奔、翁姑不认、流落庵堂、得中状元、阖家团圆。我这么一说，很容易被人误会这是一个流于俗套的悲欢离合的才子佳人戏。但可贵的就是它虽然有那类情节，却偏偏不是那样的戏。
    就拿李倩君来说：她是个从不忸怩作态的千金，她在墙头上看见一个少年，少年送给她一首诗，她毫不掩饰的接受了，并约他到她家里去。少年在花园被她的乳娘看见了，乳娘骂少年狂生，又骂丫环从中牵引，就在这个时候，李倩君直认不讳的对乳娘说：“他不是仙郎迷路入天台，是我墙头掷果自招来。”
    言慧珠恰到好处的表现了这位千金的率真。莺莺赖简、五娘犹豫，这都是很好的性格描写，但如果把赖简、犹豫的情节放在李倩君身上，就不真实了。言慧珠在塑造这个形象时，显然，不是单从封建时代女性的共性上去考虑的，她充分的注意了这个人物特定的性格。
    我们在小说中、戏剧中看到过不少像张珙、罗密欧那类的形象，而裴少俊这个人物却不常见；他私订终身的时候很勇敢，但是把妻子带回家来好几年却始终不敢告诉父亲。要说他不够至诚，是不公平的。他为了要亲自照护妻子产后的生活，情愿不要功名，不去赴试，拿了父亲给的赶考费三百两银子，从前门出去，打后门进来，等到妻子满月，才又由后门出去，从前门进来，跪见父亲，扯了个谎，说自己名落孙山。这个从小就被众人誉为神童、满腹经纶的裴才子为了他的李倩君，甘愿承认自己胸中无墨、不求上进，而挨了父亲的斥责和殴打，难道这还不够至诚吗？
    但是也正因为他一向是他父亲的好儿子，是他父亲引为骄傲的人，而不是像贾宝玉那样从小就有了叛逆的性格，所以在交代这件非明媒正娶的婚姻问题上，他很迟疑。他幻想有一天能够把这件事和平的公开，当这种幻想总不能实现时，他就因循了。
    作者对这个人物是有些批判的，譬如当他的父亲发现了这件秘密后，大发雷霆，马上逼着儿子写休书，裴少俊到底执拗不过父亲，写了休书。虽然写完后他忿忿地把休书扔给了父亲。在“元曲选”里，白仁甫甚至让裴少俊写了休书后背着父亲骑马送了“被休”的妻子一程。这些补笔，当然是非常必要的，因为他写休书确实是出于被迫；但是休书毕竟是写了。比起李倩君来，他实在缺少大丈夫气概。所以：“好一个多才的状元公，写得一手好休书啊！”
    俞振飞维妙维肖的塑造了这样一个有些懦弱的至诚君子。这是一个非常难演的角色，强调了这面，他可能像张珙；强调了那面，他又可能像“孔雀东南飞”里的焦仲卿。难得艺术家如此准确的掌握了这个性格、掌握了这个戏的喜剧性。
    华传浩是昆曲的名丑，在这个戏里，他扮演了一个非常诙谐的院公。他一方面帮助裴、李成亲，一方面又责怪他们荒唐；而且往往从埋怨声中流露出他对这对年轻人的爱护。当裴行俭在后花园中对陌生的孩子和少妇产生怀疑时，他像一只老母鸡似的张开翅膀极力掩护这些雏儿，把倩君和端端、重阳说成是和裴家半点关系也没有的邻居；但当李倩君挺身把秘密揭破后，他又极力在老尚书面前把这件婚姻说得简直是天赐良缘。华传浩在这个戏里刻划了一个非常可爱的老院公，他和裴尚书在剧中形成了鲜明的对照。
    这个剧本的改编也相当成功，原著中，裴少俊这个形象，是比较逊色的。原著第一折是裴、李在墙头马上邂逅；第二折幽会；第三折就是七年后，裴尚书发现秘密的儿媳。全剧根本没有正面的表现裴少俊、李倩君婚后的恩爱，所以当他写了休书后，这个形象在原著中非常不可爱。改编本只加了一段：“从前门出去，由后门进来；再由后门出去，打前门进来。”就把这个人物精神面貌改变了，因此，观众并不因为他写了休书而认为他薄幸。可以说，改编者给予了裴少俊这个形象必要的、出色的补充。
