Under the Guise of "Democracy" and "Freedom"
——Political Persecution of the Working Class by the American Monopoly Bourgeoisie	Yang Chongguang
    American leaders have recently personally stepped forward to tout America's "democracy," "freedom," and "American way of life." On August 12, Eisenhower even shamelessly described the current major strike of American steelworkers, a sharp class struggle, as a manifestation of "free democracy" at a press conference. During his visit to the Soviet Union, U.S. Vice President Nixon portrayed the painful lives of millions of unemployed American workers as being guaranteed a high standard of living. However, these lies, which try every possible means to conceal the profound class contradictions in the United States today, cannot stand the test of ironclad facts.
    While half a million American steelworkers were engaged in a heroic struggle against the monopoly capitalist groups, the American ruling group played a series of tricks, passing new anti-labor laws in the U.S. Congress in an attempt to further crack down on the American labor movement. As early as January of this year, in his State of the Union Address to the U.S. Congress, the U.S. President fiercely declared that, in order to suppress the American labor movement, "half-measures will not solve the problem." On January 28, he presented a new bill against workers' rights to Congress. On August 6, he delivered a radio address on "effectively reforming" American labor legislation, saying that "this country needs to enact a federal law to deal with" the American labor movement, "and I have been advocating the enactment of such a law for two years."
    Now the Landrum-Griffin Anti-Labor Act has been passed by the U.S. Congress. This law stipulates that a union chairman who does not allow thugs hired by capitalists to disrupt union meetings will face two years in prison; unions must submit reports on various activities to the government; workers are not allowed to boycott goods from other departments that are on strike; this law even prohibits unions from reporting news of capitalists arbitrarily deducting wages and adopting sweatshop systems. This reactionary law has aroused the indignation of the broad masses of American workers. Even right-wing American union leaders such as AFL-CIO President Meany had to admit that this law "virtually makes it impossible for generally honest unions to function effectively" and puts American unions in a "legal cage."
    The American reactionaries' attack on the political rights of the American working class has been consistent. The gradual trend towards fascism in the United States is a major characteristic of American political life since World War II. In order to carry out foreign aggression unrestrainedly, to prepare a "stable" rear for military adventures aimed at conquering the world, and to shift the consequences of the economic crisis onto the working people in order to extract the maximum profit, the American monopoly bourgeoisie, while oppressing the people of other countries, has also intensified its repression of the American people and the working class. The monopoly bourgeoisie uses the army, police, prisons, and courts it controls to destroy the American labor movement and persecute and kill outstanding members of the American working class.
    The spearhead of the American ruling class's suppression of the labor movement is first directed at the vanguard of the American working class, the Communist Party of the United States and progressive trade union organizations. In March 1947, then-U.S. President Truman issued an order announcing the implementation of so-called "loyalty checks" for civil servants. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Labor announced a statement that communists were not protected by law. Soon, the so-called "Un-American Activities" Investigation Committee filed legal charges against responsible cadres of the Communist Party of the United States. In this political atmosphere filled with anti-communist hysteria, the U.S. Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Anti-Labor Act on June 23, 1947.
    The Taft-Hartley Act completely violates the U.S. Constitution and is an important sign of the U.S. moving towards fascism. This bill stipulates: prohibiting the inclusion of clauses in collective contracts that only allow enterprises to hire people with union membership, giving capitalists the right to hire spies and scabs to monitor and disrupt workers' activities; allowing employers to participate in union elections, allowing capitalists to directly interfere in the democratic rights of unions; employers can only negotiate and sign collective contracts with those unions recognized by the U.S. government's "National Labor Relations Board," and in order to be recognized by this board, union leaders must pledge that they are not communists or members of other "subversive" organizations as deemed by the Department of Justice. This deprives any progressive-leaning trade union organization of the right to negotiate with capitalists. Even more absurdly, the provisions also stipulate: unions must notify employers of strike plans sixty days before the strike is held, so that capitalists can plan in advance to sabotage the strike; the U.S. President has the right to postpone strikes that have been announced or started for eighty days; employers have the right to sue in court to demand that unions compensate for all losses caused by the strike struggles of union members; allowing any group of workers in an enterprise to sign individual collective contracts, thereby encouraging the division of the workforce, and so on. It is very clear that the monopoly groups' despicable attempt to formulate this law is not only to make the American labor movement separate from the leadership and influence of the Communist Party and all progressive elements, but even the struggles of the members of the yellow trade unions to protect their right to survive are subjected to heavy restraints, and it deprives American workers of their most basic rights.
    Since the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, the American monopoly capital group has intensified its political persecution of the American working class. A large number of American communists and union activists have been arrested. In July 1948, twelve members of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, headed by Comrade Foster, were arrested by the U.S. government on the trumped-up charge of "conspiring to incite the violent overthrow of the U.S. government." Subsequently, the reactionary "Smith Act," the so-called "thought control law," began to be widely implemented.
    In September 1950, the U.S. Congress passed the so-called "Subversive Activities Control Act," the "McCarran-Wood Act." According to this law, U.S. intelligence agencies can label any group or individual with progressive tendencies as having "dangerous tendencies" and persecute them, allowing courts and police to use terrorist means at will to deal with the labor movement.
    In December 1950, the American ruling class, taking advantage of the Korean War, declared a national "state of emergency," suppressed the major strike of American railway workers, and issued orders to persecute progressive dockworkers' and maritime workers' unions, causing the activists of these two union organizations to be dismissed en masse by monopoly capitalists on the grounds of "suspicion of sabotage activities." Since then, the U.S. government has conducted large-scale arrests and interrogations of progressive figures. In 1951, fifteen activists from the central leadership organs of the Communist Party of the United States and the party organizations in New York were arrested and brought to trial, thirteen of whom were later sentenced to long prison terms.
    The "McCarthyism" that began in late 1952 was a major step in the United States towards fascism. Under the fascist terror of McCarthyism, secret agent rule became even more intensified. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation openly boasted that it had preserved the fingerprints of more than 110 million Americans. Tens of thousands of activists in the American labor movement and ordinary citizens were innocently sentenced to long prison terms or subjected to court trials. For example, Lenan, the leader of the American Maritime Union, was tried in court for writing an article commemorating Comrade Foster's 70th birthday, and the famous peace activists the Rosenbergs were also cruelly murdered. In January 1954, the U.S. government submitted to Congress a series of even more reactionary "amendments" to the Taft-Hartley Act, such as expanding the authority of state governments to supervise union activities, requiring unions to hold worker votes under government supervision when calling for strikes to determine whether workers "truly agree to strike," and so on.
    In the past two or three years, the American reactionaries have implemented new tricks in their persecution of the American working class. Monopoly capitalists have promoted the so-called "Right to Work Law" in many states in the United States. This law prohibits unions from representing workers when negotiating with employers and, under the pretext of maintaining "individual rights," prohibits workers from organizing strikes. It is obvious that this law is even more brutally destructive of workers' basic rights than the Taft-Hartley Act. If this law is implemented, it will separate workers from unions, paralyze union organizations, and prevent workers from engaging in struggles under the leadership of unions. This law gives spies and scabs many "rights" to undermine workers' struggles, so this law is called the "Scab Rights Law" by many workers in the United States. Before November 1958, eighteen states in the United States had passed this law, and the ruling class has tried its best to expand this law to the entire United States. The recent clamor by Eisenhower to reform labor legislation and the new anti-labor law passed by the U.S. Congress are a new development in a series of anti-labor measures in the United States. The conspiracy of the American monopoly bourgeoisie to more directly control or even completely destroy unions has now been fully exposed.
    These extremely reactionary legislations issued by the U.S. Congress and government are all formulated by the National Association of Manufacturers or at its behest. The National Association of Manufacturers is the general staff of the big American monopoly capitalists. More than a month before the passage of the Taft-Hartley Anti-Labor Act, the "American Manufacturers Association News Bulletin" admitted on May 17, 1947, that the real author of this law was none other than this association. It is precisely because of the monopoly capitalists' constant suppression and sabotage of trade union activities that only more than 17 million workers in the United States have been organized, accounting for only about a quarter of the total number of workers in the United States, and nearly three-quarters of the workers are excluded from the ranks of trade unions.
    The monopoly bourgeoisie's attack and persecution of the American working class and progressive forces is unscrupulous. However, the actual situation of the American labor movement shows that the facts are not developing in the way the monopoly bourgeoisie subjectively wishes. The American working class, with its fighting traditions, is rising up and launching struggles to defend their right to live and their political rights. The Communist Party of the United States, regardless of fascist terror and all kinds of great difficulties, stands at the forefront of this struggle, heroically defends the interests of the American working class, and educates the working class to rise up against the attacks of the monopoly bourgeoisie and strive for the unity of the labor movement. In recent years, the American labor movement has developed. Between 1953 and 1958 alone, American workers held 23,600 strikes, with 12 million participants, many of which lasted for several months. In the first half of this year, American workers held 1,975 strikes, with 850,000 participants, causing capitalists to lose 12.5 million workdays.
    The ongoing strike of 500,000 steelworkers is a powerful demonstration of the determination and solidarity of the American working class in its struggle against the monopoly bourgeoisie. (Attached picture)

    在“民主”和“自由”的幌子下
    ——美国垄断资产阶级对工人阶级的政治迫害	杨重光
    美国领导人最近亲自出马，吹嘘美国的“民主”、“自由”和“美国生活方式”。艾森豪威尔8月12日在记者招待会上竟把目前美国钢铁工人大罢工这个尖锐的阶级斗争说成是“自由民主”的表现。美国副总统尼克松在访苏时把美国几百万失业工人的痛苦生活描绘成有高度生活水平的保证。但是，这些千方百计地掩饰当前美国深刻的阶级矛盾的谎言，是经不起铁的事实的检验的。
    当美国五十万钢铁工人同垄断资本集团展开英勇斗争的时候，美国统治集团玩弄了一系列的手法，在美国国会通过新的反劳工法，企图进一步打击美国工人运动。早在今年1月美国总统向美国国会宣读的国情咨文中，就气势凶凶地说，为了镇压美国工人运动，
  “不彻底的措施是解决不了问题的”。1月28日他向国会提出了反对工人权利的新法案。8月6日他发表了“有效地改革”美国劳工立法的广播演说，他说“这个国家需要制订一个联邦法律来对付”美国工人运动，“两年来，我一直主张制订这样的法律”。
    现在兰德勒姆—格里芬反劳工法已被美国国会通过。这个法律规定：工会主席如果不允许被资本家雇用的流氓捣乱工会举行的会议，就要坐两年监牢；工会必须向政府提交各种活动的报告；不许工人对进行罢工的其他部门进行商品抵制；这个法律甚至还不许工会报道资本家任意克扣工资和采用血汗制度的消息。这个反动法律已经激起了美国广大工人群众的愤慨。连美国右翼工会领袖如劳联—产联主席米尼也不得不说这个法律“实际上使一般正直的工会不可能进行有效的工作”，使美国工会陷于“法律牢笼”。
    美国反动派对美国工人阶级政治权利的进攻是一贯的。美国逐渐走向法西斯化是第二次世界大战以后美国政治生活的一个主要特点。美国垄断资产阶级为了放手对外侵略，替妄图征服世界的军事冒险准备“稳定”的后方，为了把经济危机的后果转嫁给劳动人民，榨取最高限度的利润，他们在压迫世界其他国家人民的同时，也加紧了对美国人民和工人阶级的镇压。垄断资产阶级运用它所掌握的军队、警察、监狱和法院，摧残美国的工人运动，迫害和杀戮美国工人阶级的优秀分子。
    美国统治阶级镇压工人运动的矛头，首先针对着美国工人阶级的先锋队美国共产党和进步工会组织。1947年3月，当时的美国总统杜鲁门发布命令，宣布对国家公务员实行所谓“忠诚审查”。同时美国劳工部又宣布共产党员不受法律保护的声明。不久，所谓“非美活动”调查委员会就对美国共产党的负责干部提出法律起诉。在这种充满了反共的歇斯底里的政治气氛下，美国国会在1947年6月23日通过了塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法。
    塔夫脱—哈特莱法完全违反美国的宪法，它是美国走向法西斯化的一个重要的标志。这个法案规定：禁止在集体合同中订入只许企业雇用有工会会员身分的人的条文，使资本家有权雇用特务和工贼来监视和破坏工人的活动；允许企业主参加工会的选举，让资本家直接干涉工会的民主权利；企业主只能同美国政府的“全国劳工关系局”所承认的那些工会进行谈判和签订集体合同，而为了要得到这个局的承认，工会的领导人必须具结保证他们不是共产党员或被司法部认为是其他“破坏性”组织的成员。这就剥夺了任何具有进步倾向的工会组织同资本家进行谈判的权利。更荒谬的是，条文还规定：工会必须把罢工的计划在罢工举行前六十天通知企业主，好让资本家预先策划对罢工的破坏；美国总统有权使已经宣布或开始的罢工延期八十天；企业主有权向法院起诉要求工会赔偿因工会会员的罢工斗争引起的一切损失；允许企业中任何工人集团签订单独的集体合同，从而鼓励工人队伍的分裂等等。十分明显，垄断集团制订这个法律的卑鄙企图是不仅使美国工人运动脱离共产党和一切进步分子的领导和影响，而且连黄色工会的会员们的保卫生存权利的斗争都受到重重的束缚，它把美国工人最基本的权利都剥夺了。
    自从塔夫脱—哈特莱法案通过以后，美国垄断资本集团对美国工人阶级的政治迫害就更为加紧了。大批美国共产党人和工会活动家遭到逮捕。1948年7月，以福斯特同志为首的美国共产党全国委员会十二位委员被美国政府以所谓“阴谋鼓动用暴力颠覆美国政府”的莫须有的罪名被捕。接着，反动的“史密斯法”即所谓“思想管制法”又开始广泛地实行。
    1950年9月，美国国会又通过所谓“颠覆活动管制法”即“麦卡伦—伍德法”。根据这个法律，美国特务机关可以把任何带有进步倾向的团体和个人戴上“危险倾向”的帽子而加以迫害，使法庭和警察能随心所欲地采用恐怖手段来对付工人运动。
    1950年12月，美国统治阶级又利用侵朝战争，宣布全国“紧急状态”，镇压美国铁路工人的大罢工，并颁布了迫害进步的码头工人工会和海员工会的命令，使这两个工会组织的积极分子被垄断资本家用“有破坏活动嫌疑”的罪名大批解雇。此后，美国政府对进步人士进行了大规模的逮捕和审讯。1951年美国共产党中央领导机关和纽约的党组织的十五位活动家横遭逮捕并被交付法庭审判，其中有十三位后来被判处长期监禁。
    1952年底开始实行的“麦卡锡主义”，更是美国走向法西斯化的一个重大步骤。在麦卡锡主义的法西斯恐怖之下，特务统治就变本加厉起来。美国联邦调查局公然夸耀它保存着一亿一千多万美国人的指纹。成千上万的美国工人运动的活动家和普通公民被无辜判处长期监禁或受到法庭的审讯。如美国海员工会领袖列南，由于写了一篇纪念福斯特同志七十寿辰的文章就受到法庭审讯，著名的和平人士罗森堡夫妇也被残酷地杀害了。1954年1月，美国政府又向国会提出了对塔夫脱—哈特莱法一系列内容更加反动的“修正”，如扩大各州政府监督工会活动方面的权限，工会号召罢工时必须在政府监督下举行工人投票，决定工人“是否真正同意罢工”，等等。
    最近两三年来，美国反动派对美国工人阶级的迫害又施行了新的花样。垄断资本家推动美国许多州实行所谓“工作权利法”，这个法令不许工会在和企业主谈判时代表工人，并且在维护“个人权利”的借口下禁止工人组织罢工。显而易见，这个法律对工人基本权利的破坏比塔夫脱—哈特莱法更加残暴。如果实行这个法令，那就会使工人和工会脱离开来，使工会组织瘫痪，工人不能在工会领导下进行斗争。这个法律给予特务和工贼们以许多破坏工人斗争的“权利”，因此这个法律被美国不少工人称为“工贼权利法”。到1958年11月前，美国已有十八个州通过了这个法令，统治阶级还竭力企图把这个法令扩大到整个美国。最近艾森豪威尔所叫嚣的改革劳工立法和美国国会通过的新的反劳工法，正是美国一系列反劳工措施的一个新的发展。美国垄断资产阶级企图更直接地控制甚至完全摧毁工会的阴谋，至此已经暴露无遗了。
    美国国会和政府所发布的这些反动透顶的立法都是由美国全国制造商协会亲自动手或在它的授意下制订的。美国全国制造商协会是美国大垄断资本家的参谋本部。当塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法通过以前一个多月，在1947年5月17日“美国制造商协会新闻公报”就承认，这个法律的真正作者不是别人，而正是这个协会。正是由于垄断资本家对工会活动不断镇压和破坏，美国已经组织起来的工人只有一千七百多万人，仅占美国工人总数的四分之一左右，将近四分之三的工人却被排挤在工会的队伍之外。
    垄断资产阶级对美国工人阶级和进步力量的进攻和迫害是无所不用其极的。但是美国工人运动的实际情况说明，事实并不按照垄断资产阶级的主观愿望所设想的那样在发展。具有斗争传统的美国工人阶级正在奋发起来，展开保卫生活权利和政治权利的斗争。美国共产党不顾法西斯恐怖和种种巨大的困难，站在这个斗争的前列，英勇地捍卫美国工人阶级的利益，教育工人阶级起来反对垄断资产阶级的进攻，争取工人运动的统一。这几年来，美国的工人运动有了发展。仅仅在1953年到1958年之间，美国工人就举行了二万三千六百次罢工，参加者达一千二百万人，其中有许多次罢工还坚持了几个月。今年上半年美国工人举行了一千九百七十五次罢工，有八十五万人参加，使资本家损失了一千二百五十万个工作日。
    目前仍在继续坚持中的五十万钢铁工人大罢工，更是有力地表现了美国工人阶级对垄断资产阶级斗争的坚决性和他们的团结力量。（附图片）
