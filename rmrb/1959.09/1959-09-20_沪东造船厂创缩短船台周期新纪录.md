Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 18th. The coastal freighter "Peace Sixty," built by Shanghai Hudong Shipyard with a displacement of 4,735 tons, was launched yesterday. The dock cycle for building this ship was only twenty days, a reduction of two-thirds compared to the dock cycle of the first similar type of sea vessel built by the factory this year.

The new dock cycle record is the result of opposing right-leaning tendencies, exerting great effort, and achieving an all-round leap forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. After leading cadres in the shipbuilding workshop studied the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Emotions, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy" in early August, they set the dock cycle for this sea vessel at thirty days, halving the time compared to the first similar sea vessel manufactured this year. At that time, some cadres were worried that it could not be done. However, after discussion by the workers, it was believed that the task could be completed in twenty-six days. From August 29th, when the ship went on the dock, the factory's leading cadres fought alongside the workers. With the support of the Party organization, the dock workers proposed many new processes and improved labor organization, enthusiastically launching competitions, so that not only was the welding speed faster, but the weld quality was also greatly improved compared to the first vessel. As a result, the task was completed in twenty days.

This ship is 99.23 meters in overall length, has a draft of 5.5 meters, and a deadweight tonnage of 3,000 tons.

    沪东造船厂创缩短船台周期新纪录
    新华社上海18日电上海沪东造船厂建造的排水量四千七百三十五吨的沿海货轮“和平六十号”，昨天已经下水。建造这艘船的船台周期只有二十天，比这个厂今年建造的第一艘同类型海轮的船台周期缩短了三分之二。
    新的船台周期纪录，是反右倾，鼓干劲，多快好省全面跃进的结果。8月初，造船车间的领导干部学习了人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”社论以后，把这艘海轮的船台周期定为三十天，比今年制造的第一艘同类型海轮缩短了一半时间。当时，一部分干部曾经担心做不到。但是经过工人讨论，认为二十六天就可以完成任务。从8月29日这艘船上船台起，工厂的领导干部一直和工人一起战斗。在党组织的支持下，船台工人提出了许多新工艺，并且改进劳动组织，热烈地开展了竞赛，因此不仅焊接的速度快，焊缝质量也比第一艘大有提高。结果二十天就完成了任务。
    这艘船总长九十九点二三米，吃水五点五米，载重量是三千吨。
