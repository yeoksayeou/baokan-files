Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 27th: Shanghai scientific workers presenting over two thousand research projects as gifts to the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation have mostly completed or are about to complete them ahead of schedule by mid-September. Among them, there are about three hundred major projects that are advanced, large-scale, precise, and cutting-edge, and some have already been used in production, achieving good results.

	In terms of industrial technology, the Materials Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building's Institute of Mechanical Manufacturing and Technology recently developed a regenerative ultra-fast automatic chemical analyzer. This is an important instrument for chemical analysis of steel metals. The Shanghai Fisheries College has developed a "sea condition remote control automatic recorder," which can accurately measure the temperature and salinity of seawater, providing reliable data for fish forecasting. Other important products that have been researched and developed include large metallographic testers, high-temperature cement, various alloy steels, new bridge cranes, and electron microscopes that magnify 100,000 times. In terms of agriculture and biological sciences, research on high-yield experience of wheat, rice, cotton, rapeseed, and vegetables, research on the physiological basis of reasonable close planting, the city's soil chronicles, rice and vegetable variety chronicles, and a collection of research papers on artificial induction of spawning in domestic fish have been completed, which are of great significance to the current high yield of agriculture and biological sciences. In terms of medicine and health, more important ones include papers on the treatment of severe burns, research reports on the integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment of hypertension, and papers on the mechanism of acupuncture treatment of appendicitis. In addition, the Shanghai Second Medical College independently designed and manufactured two heart-lung machines entirely with domestic materials.
	
	Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 27th: Scientific workers in Shaanxi Province are going all out, closely integrating with industrial and agricultural production to carry out scientific and technological research, and using brilliant achievements to dedicate to the National Day. According to the statistics of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences alone, there are 55 research projects to be completed this year. At present, most of the projects have achieved preliminary results.

	Since this spring, provincial-level agricultural research institutions have conducted in-depth investigations into reality, and after studying with the masses, they have written books such as "Wheat High-Yield Experience" and "Technical Experience in Preventing and Controlling Wheat Stripe Rust." The scientific workers of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, combined with more than 13,000 farmer soil technicians, carried out soil survey, identification, and utilization planning work throughout the province before the end of June, laying the foundation for long-term farmland capital construction.

	Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 27th: Scientific research institutions, factories, enterprises, and universities in Harbin are dedicating outstanding scientific research achievements to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation. According to incomplete statistics from the Harbin Municipal Science and Technology Commission, the city has completed 301 major scientific research and technological innovation projects this year, including 147 new product research and trial production projects and 154 projects adopting important new technologies.

	The main characteristics of this batch of successfully researched and tested projects are that they are closely integrated with production and have great significance for promoting the development of China's national economy, and some also mark the leap forward in China's young cutting-edge science and technology level. For example, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shanghai Optical Instrument Factory, and the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences collaborated to successfully trial-produce an electron microscope with a magnification of 100,000 times. This microscope can distinguish one thirty-five thousandth of a strand of hair.

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 28th: The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has completed more than 270 research projects of various sizes this year, accounting for more than 80% of the annual plan. Some major research projects, such as electrostatic accelerators, radar aerial survey instruments, radio altimeters, fertilizer effect tests of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae, and Yangtze River aquatic resources surveys, have been completed or are nearing completion.

	Researchers at the Surveying and Mapping Research Institute actively sought substitutes, and after repeated experiments, finally solved the technical problem of pulse transformers, making the trial production of the new instrument of radio altimeter a success.

    科学工作者争献新礼
    上海陕西哈尔滨武汉等地完成大批科学研究项目
    据新华社上海27日电　上海科学工作者向伟大的建国十周年献礼的二千多个研究项目，截至9月中旬止已大部提前完成或即将完成。其中属于高大精尖的重大项目约有三百多个，有的已经用于生产，取得了很好的效果。
    在工业技术方面，第一机械工业部机械制造与工艺科学研究院材料研究所不久以前制成了复能式特快自动化学分析仪。这是钢铁金属进行化学分析的重要仪表。上海水产学院研究制成了一种“海况遥控自动记录仪”，能够正确地测量出海水的温度和盐度，为鱼情预报提供了可靠的资料。其他还研究制成大型金相检验器、高温水泥、多种合金钢、新型桥式起重机、放大十万倍的电子显微镜等重要产品。在农业和生物科学方面，已完成小麦、水稻、棉花、油菜、蔬菜等丰产经验的研究，合理密植生理基础的研究，全市土壤志，水稻、蔬菜品种志，家鱼的人工催产研究论文集等，对当前农业的高产和生物科学都有很大的意义。医药卫生方面比较重大的有严重烧伤治疗研究的论文，高血压的中西医综合疗法研究报告，针灸治疗阑尾炎机制的论文等，另外上海第二医学院还自行设计和全部用国产材料制成两架人工心肺机。
    据新华社西安27日电　陕西省科学工作者正鼓足干劲，紧密结合工农业生产开展科学技术研究工作，用辉煌的成就向国庆献礼。仅据中国科学院陕西分院和中国农业科学院陕西分院的统计，今年要完成的研究项目就有五十五个。目前，大部分项目已经获得了初步成果。
    今春以来，省级农业研究机构就深入实际进行调查，同群众一起研究之后写成了“小麦丰产经验”“防治小麦条锈病技术经验”等书。中国农业科学院陕西分院的科学工作者和一万三千多名农民土壤技术员相结合，于6月底前在全省范围内进行了土壤普查鉴定利用规划工作，给长远的农田基本建设打下了基础。
    据新华社哈尔滨27日电　哈尔滨各科学研究机关、工厂企业和高等学校，以出色的科学研究成果，向建国十周年献礼。据哈尔滨市科学技术委员会不完全统计，全市今年已完成的重大科学研究和技术革新项目有三百零一项，其中属于新产品研究试制的一百四十七项，属于采用重要新技术的一百五十四项。
    这批研究试验成功的项目，主要的特点是密切结合生产，对促进我国国民经济的发展有着重大的作用和意义，有的并标志着我国年轻的尖端科学技术水平的跃进。例如哈尔滨工业大学、上海光学仪器厂和中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所协作，试制成功了一台放大倍率达十万倍的电子显微镜。这架显微镜能够鉴别出一根头发丝的三万五千分之一。
    据新华社武汉28日电　中国科学院武汉分院今年已完成大小研究项目二百七十多个，占全年计划80％以上。静电加速器、雷达航空测量仪、无线电测高仪、固氮蓝藻的肥效试验、长江水产资源调查等一些重大研究项目，都已经陆续完成或接近完成。
    测量制图研究所研究人员积极寻找代用物品，经过反复试验，终于解决了脉冲变压器的技术难题，使无线电测高仪这一新的仪器试制成功。
