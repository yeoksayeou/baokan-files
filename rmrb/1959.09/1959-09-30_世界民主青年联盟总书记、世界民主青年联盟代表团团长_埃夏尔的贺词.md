Greetings from Eshar, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and Head of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Delegation

Dear friends!

On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we extend our warmest congratulations to you on behalf of the World Federation of Democratic Youth with joy and excitement.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth is convinced that millions of young people around the world share the same feelings, devoting all their youthful vigor and enthusiasm to the cause of peace, fighting to eliminate the remnants of colonialism and eliminate imperialism.

The democratic youth of the world cherish the consistent efforts made by the People's China and its government to maintain peace and support the rights of all peoples to national independence. The democratic youth of the world fully support the Chinese people and youth in their struggle to restore territorial sovereignty in Taiwan and to smash the provocations of the American imperialists in the region.

The rapid transformation of old semi-colonial China into an advanced country, the vigorous economic development of China, the elimination of ignorance, the leap forward in education, culture and science, and the achievements in infant and youth health care, all these eloquent facts provide answers to the questions of concern to the majority of young people in many countries, especially the oppressed countries.

Your youth, together with the people, participate in the economic and social life of the new China, providing them with a shining example.

Dear friends, broad sections of young people are aware that they are living in a great historical era full of heroic deeds.

The younger generation is participating in the greatest economic and social changes, and they have seen the astonishing achievements of science and technology, most recently represented by the Soviet lunar rocket.

They are threatened with nuclear war every day. A handful of greedy and selfish people would launch this war at the first opportunity, and young people also see that the power of our people today is strong enough to defend peace.

Although many countries are still suffering from colonial oppression, young people have seen that colonialism can be completely eradicated.

All these facts are conducive to the vigorous development of youth forces, prompting them to occupy a unique position in the broad world peace movement, the national independence movement, and the movement to improve living conditions.

In this situation, how can young people not welcome the efforts made by governments such as your government and the Soviet government that pursue a peaceful foreign policy? The specific proposals on disarmament put forward by Chairman Khrushchev during his visit to the United States once again demonstrated the efforts made by the Soviet government.

There is no doubt that we must continue to move forward on this road. On the other hand, it is also essential to unite the broadest masses of people as soon as possible.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth is willing to assure you that it is now working to promote understanding and cooperation between young people of all countries, and will make greater efforts in this regard in the future.

In recent times, the world peace and democratic youth movement has achieved great success.

When the Seventh World Festival of Youth and Students was held for the first time in a Western capital - Vienna - the younger generation expressed their feelings particularly vividly.

We want to emphasize that, on the one hand, some political activists have exhausted their ability to spread rumors and slanders, or are so stupid that they ignore the existence of People's China; on the other hand, the representatives of your country's youth who participated in this festival were welcomed as dear friends by the representatives of young people from one hundred and twelve countries and one thousand two hundred youth organizations. The same was true of the World University Games recently held in Italy.

We greatly value the support given by Chinese youth and Chinese youth organizations to this broad peaceful youth movement and the significant contributions they have made to this movement. We know that we can count on your support in the future as well.

Dear friends, thank you to the people of your country, the youth of your country, and the government of your country for inviting us to participate in the grand celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We congratulate you on your new achievements in building your own country and in the cause of maintaining peace and opposing imperialism.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the friendship between the people of all countries in the world and the Chinese people!

### 世界民主青年联盟总书记、世界民主青年联盟代表团团长  埃夏尔的贺词

    世界民主青年联盟总书记、世界民主青年联盟代表团团长
    埃夏尔的贺词亲爱的朋友们！
    在中华人民共和国建国十周年的时候，我们以欢欣鼓舞的心情代表世界民主青联向你们致以最热诚的祝贺。
    世界民主青联确信全世界千百万青年也有同样的心情，他们以其青年人的全部活力和热情致力于和平事业，为清除殖民主义残余和消灭帝国主义而斗争。
    全世界的民主青年非常珍视人民中国及其政府为维护和平和支持各国人民争取民族独立权利所作的一贯努力，全世界的民主青年完全支持中国人民和青年为恢复在台湾的领土主权和粉碎美帝国主义者在这个地区的挑衅所进行的斗争。
    古老的半殖民地的中国迅速地改造成为先进的国家，中国的蓬勃经济发展，愚昧无知状态的消灭，教育、文化和科学事业的飞跃进步，婴儿和青年保健方面的成就，所有这些雄辩的事实，给许多国家特别是被压迫国家的大多数青年所关心的问题提出了答案。
    你们的青年同人民一起参加新中国的经济和社会生活，给他们提供了一个光辉的榜样。
    亲爱的朋友们，广大阶层的青年都意识到生活在一个充满英雄事迹的伟大历史时代。
    青年一代参加到最伟大的经济和社会的变革中，他们看到最近以苏联月球火箭为卓越代表的科学技术的惊人成就。
    他们每天都受着核子战争的威胁。一撮贪婪自私的人一有可能就会发动这场战争，而青年也同时看到我们今天人民的力量已经十分强大，足以保卫和平。
    尽管许多国家仍然遭受着殖民主义压迫，青年已经看到可以彻底地铲除殖民主义。
    所有这些事实都有利于青年力量的蓬勃发展，促使他们在广泛的世界和平运动、民族独立运动和争取改善生活条件的运动中占据独特地位。
    在这种情况下，青年们对于像贵国政府和苏联政府那样奉行和平外交政策的政府所作的努力怎能不表示欢迎呢？赫鲁晓夫主席访问美国时所提出的关于裁军的具体建议再一次表明苏联政府所作的这种努力。
    毫无疑问必须在这条道路上继续前进，另一方面，尽速团结最广泛的各国人民也是十分必要的。
    世界民主青年联盟愿意向你们保证，它现在努力促进各国青年之间的了解和合作，今后在这方面将作出更大的努力。
    最近时期以来，世界和平和民主青年运动获得了巨大的成就。
    当第一次在一个西方国家的首都——维也纳举行第七届世界青年和学生联欢节的时候，年青一代特别生动地表达出来了他们的感情。
    我们要着重指出，一方面有些政治活动家竭尽造谣诬蔑的能事，或者愚蠢透顶，竟然无视人民中国的存在；另一方面参加这一届联欢节的贵国青年代表们像亲爱的朋友那样受到了一百一十二个国家的青年和一千二百个青年团体的代表们的欢迎。最近在意大利举行的世界大学生运动会的情况也是这样。
    我们非常珍视中国青年和中国青年团体给予这一广泛的和平青年运动的支持以及对这一运动所作出的重大贡献。我们知道在今后我们也同样可以指望获得你们的支持。
    亲爱的朋友们，感谢贵国人民、贵国青年、贵国政府邀请我们参加中华人民共和国建国十周年庆祝盛典。我们祝贺你们在建设自己的祖国、维护和平反对帝国主义的事业中获得新的成就。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    全世界各国人民和中国人民之间的友谊万岁！（附图片）
