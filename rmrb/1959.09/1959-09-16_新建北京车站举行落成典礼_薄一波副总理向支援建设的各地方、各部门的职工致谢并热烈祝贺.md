Xinhua News Agency, September 15th. The inauguration ceremony for the newly built Beijing Railway Station, currently our country's largest passenger station, was held today, and it was officially handed over for use.

Attending today's inauguration ceremony were Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo, Vice Ministers of Railways Lü Zhengcao, Wu Jingtao, and Liu Jianzhang, Vice Mayor of Beijing Le Songsheng, Minister of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee's Transportation Department Chai Zemin, and over three thousand workers from the construction and design departments.

At 9:00 AM, the inauguration ceremony was solemnly held on the spacious plaza in front of the station building. Vice Premier Bo Yibo, on behalf of the State Council, extended warm congratulations and gratitude to all the workers who built the Beijing Railway Station and to the workers from various regions and departments who actively supported the construction of the Beijing Railway Station. He said: The newly built Beijing Railway Station is magnificent in scale, and its technical structure and equipment are unprecedented in the country. According to convention, design and construction would take at least three years; however, the station builders, with great drive, used only a little over seven months, and including design, it took only ten months to have a magnificent passenger station standing before us. This once again fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and proves the unparalleled correctness of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. Let the reactionary factions at home and abroad engage in all kinds of slander, attacks, and shameless clamoring against the General Line and the Great Leap Forward! They will be brought to a head-on collision with reality.

Vice Minister of Railways Wu Jingtao and Vice Mayor of Beijing Le Songsheng both spoke at the meeting. Wu Jingtao gave a detailed introduction to the magnificent scale and new technical structure and equipment of the Beijing Railway Station. He said that the construction of the new Beijing Railway Station officially started on January 20 this year and was basically completed on September 10, with a total construction period of only seven months and twenty days. After detailed inspection and acceptance by the acceptance unit, it was considered that the layout of the station yard was compact and reasonable, and the shape of the station building was simple and beautiful; the plan layout was appropriate, and the equipment was relatively complete; the construction quality met the design requirements, and the overall quality was rated as good.

Vice Mayor of Beijing Le Songsheng said at the inauguration ceremony: Such a large-scale building, completed in such a short period of time, and with such good quality, is a great leap forward in China's construction industry and a victory for the Party's General Line.

Amidst the sound of firecrackers, Vice Premier Bo Yibo cut the ribbon for the station. At this time, a colorfully decorated train carrying the first batch of passengers slowly departed from the station amidst cheers. (Attached picture)

    新建北京车站举行落成典礼
    薄一波副总理向支援建设的各地方、各部门的职工致谢并热烈祝贺
    新华社15日讯　我国目前最大的客运车站——新建北京车站，今天举行落成典礼并正式交付使用。
    参加今天车站落成典礼大会的，有国务院副总理薄一波，铁道部副部长吕正操、武竞天、刘建章，北京市副市长乐松生，中共北京市委交通工作部部长柴泽民，以及为车站施工和设计等部门的三千多名职工。
    上午九时，落成典礼在车站大楼前面宽敞的广场上隆重举行。薄一波副总理代表国务院，向修建北京车站的全体职工和积极支援北京车站建设的各地方、各部门的职工们，表示热烈的祝贺和感谢。他说：新建的北京车站规模宏伟，技术构造和设备在国内是空前未有的。按照常规，设计和施工至少需要三年；而车站的建设者们鼓足干劲，只用了七个多月，加上设计也不过用了十个月的时间，一座宏伟壮丽的旅客车站就巍然矗立在我们面前了。这又一次充分证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性，证明了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的无比正确性。让国内外反动派对总路线和大跃进去进行各种诬蔑、攻击和无耻叫嚣吧！他们在事实面前将碰得头破血流。
    铁道部副部长武竞天和北京市副市长乐松生都在大会上讲了话。武竞天详细地介绍了北京车站的宏伟规模和新的技术构造及设备。他说，新建的北京车站在今年1月20日正式开工，9月10日基本竣工，全部工期只有七个月零二十天。经过验收单位详细检查验收，认为站场设计布置紧凑合理，站舍造型简洁美观；平面布置适当，设备比较完善；施工质量符合设计要求，质量总评为良好。
    北京市副市长乐松生在典礼大会上说：这样大规模的建筑，在这样短的时间内建成，又有这样好的质量，这是中国建筑界的大跃进，是党的总路线的胜利。
    鞭炮声中，薄一波副总理为车站剪了彩。这时，一列彩车载着第一批乘客在人们的欢呼声中从车站缓缓驶出。（附图片）
