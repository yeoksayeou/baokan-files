    Correctly Treat Achievements and Shortcomings in Mass Movements

    Things are often like this: People with right-leaning opportunist thinking, their non-Marxist, non-dialectical materialist, and non-historical materialist stances, viewpoints, and methods, sometimes manifest in this issue and sometimes in that issue; but the most concentrated manifestation is often in how to treat the achievements and shortcomings of mass movements. "Attack one point, exaggerate it as much as possible, and disregard the rest" is their methodology. Some well-intentioned comrades, whose ideological state is different from that of people with right-leaning opportunist thinking, sometimes also show some vague understanding on this issue. If you want others not to waver, you must first not waver yourself; if you want others to be firm, you must first be firm yourself. Therefore, clarifying this issue is necessary, both for criticizing and overcoming the right-leaning opportunist thinking in some cadres, and for clarifying our own minds and standing firm.

    We have always believed that in mass movements under the leadership of the Party, achievements always occupy the primary position, are nine fingers out of ten, and are the essential aspect of the movement; shortcomings and errors occupy the secondary position, are one finger out of ten, and are the non-essential things in the movement. Achievements are primary, and shortcomings are secondary; this is our formula. Just as everything that becomes a formula has been tested and proven by thousands of facts, this formula has also been tested and proven by thousands of facts. Naturally, this refers to the general situation of mass movements under the leadership of the Party; in individual local situations, it is possible that one of our practical tasks is executed very poorly, where shortcomings and errors occupy the primary position and achievements occupy the secondary position. Even so, the formula that achievements are primary and shortcomings are secondary in the overall aspect will still not change.

    Then, wouldn't it be better if there were no shortcomings and errors at all? This is just a naive imagination. There has never been anything in the world that has only advantages and no disadvantages. In mass movements, not only may some shortcomings and errors occur, but some are also unavoidable. This is because: First, we often lack experience in the problems encountered in mass movements, especially in movements like the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, where there is no precedent to follow. Lenin once said: "In the work of creating a new type of state system, unprecedented in world history, could there be no setbacks and errors?" "Has any new mode of production in history ever developed all at once without many failures and repeated errors?" Our shortcomings and errors are temporary and local in nature, and are insignificant compared to the long-lasting, wide-ranging, and countless errors committed by the rulers of slave society, feudal society, and capitalist society; compared to the great achievements we have made, they are only sunspots. Second, the new things that appear in mass movements, like any new things, are bound to have this or that shortcoming and appear somewhat imperfect for a certain period of time. However, they will surely grow and improve. As Lenin said: "When something new is just born, the old is always stronger than the new for a considerable time, which is a common phenomenon in nature or social life. To ridicule the weakness of the new sprouts, to hold a frivolous intellectual skepticism, etc.—all this is actually a means of class struggle by the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, to protect capitalism and oppose socialism."

    Admitting that shortcomings and errors are unavoidable naturally does not mean that we do not have to discover and correct them. We have always paid close attention to discovering shortcomings in our work, and once discovered, we immediately and conscientiously correct them. It is precisely because our shortcomings and errors are temporary and local in nature, and are difficulties encountered in development and progress, that they can be corrected and are not difficult to correct; it is completely wrong to treat them with schadenfreude. In fact, some of the shortcomings that have appeared since the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement, under the leadership of the Party, are now being rapidly overcome, while others have already been overcome.

    The occurrence of certain temporary and local shortcomings and errors in the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement is naturally not what we expected; however, after it has occurred, it can also be transformed into something beneficial. Some shortcomings, such as improper use of labor and overestimation of agricultural production, are bad from one point of view; from another point of view, they also reflect the soaring enthusiasm and great passion of the broad masses, and reflect their urgent revolutionary desire to change China's poor and blank state. Shortcomings and errors must be corrected, and never condoned; once corrected, we will gain negative experience again, become more experienced from being relatively inexperienced, and our cause will advance faster.

    This is the correct attitude we should take towards the achievements and shortcomings in mass movements.

### 正确对待群众运动中的成绩和缺点

    正确对待群众运动中的成绩和缺点
    事情常常是这样：具有右倾机会主义思想的人，他们非马克思主义的、非辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的立场、观点、方法，有时在这个问题上表现出来，有时在那个问题上表现出来；而表现得最为集中的，却又往往是在怎样对待群众运动的成绩和缺点问题上。“攻其一点，尽量夸大，不计其余”，就是他们的方法论。有些好心的同志，他们的思想状况与具有右倾机会主义思想的人是不同的，但是，有的时候也在这个问题上表现出一些模糊的认识来。要想使别人不动摇，首先要自己不动摇；要想使别人坚定，首先要自己坚定。因此，弄清楚这个问题，不论对于批判和克服某些干部中的右倾机会主义思想，对于清醒自己的头脑、站定自己的脚跟，都是必要的。
    我们历来认为，党领导下的群众运动，成绩总是居于主要地位，是十个指头中的九个指头，是运动的本质方面之所在；缺点和错误，则是居于次要地位，是十个指头中的一个指头，是运动中的非本质的东西。成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的，这就是我们的公式。正像一切成为公式的东西都是经过千百次的事实检验和证明了的一样，这个公式，也是经过千百次的事实检验和证明了的。自然，这是就党领导下的群众运动的总情况而言；在个别的局部的情况下，我们的某一项实际工作被执行得很不好，在那里，缺点和错误居于主要地位，成绩居于次要地位，这种情况也可能出现。即使如此，总的方面成绩是主要的、缺点是次要的这个公式，也仍然不会改变。
    那么，一点也不发生缺点和错误岂不更好吗？这不过是一种天真的想像。世界上从来没有光是优点没有缺点的事物。在群众运动中，不仅可能出现某些缺点和错误，而且有些还是不可避免的。这是因为：第一，我们对于群众运动中所遇到的问题，常常是缺乏经验的，特别像大跃进和人民公社这样的运动，更是没有先例可援。列宁曾经说过：“在缔造前所未有的新型国家制度这种全世界历史上新的事业中，难道能没有失利和错误吗？”“难道历史上有一种新生产方式是不经过许许多多的失败和反复的错误而一下子就发展起来的吗？”我们的缺点错误，属于暂时的、局部的性质，比起奴隶社会、封建社会、资本主义社会的统治者所犯下的那些为时长久、范围极广、难以数计的错误来，微小得不可同日而语；比起我们所取得的伟大的成绩来，也不过是太阳上的黑子。第二，群众运动中所出现的新生事物，也像任何新生事物一样，在一定时间内，总不免带有这样那样的缺点，显得有些不够完善。但是，它们却必定会茁壮起来，完善起来。也正如列宁所说的：“当新事物刚刚诞生时，旧事物在相当时期内总是比新事物强些，这在自然界或社会生活中都是常见的现象。讥笑新的幼芽软弱，抱着轻浮的知识分子的怀疑态度等等——这一切实际上是资产阶级反对无产阶级的阶级斗争手段，是保护资本主义而反对社会主义。”
    承认缺点错误不可避免，这自然不是说，我们就不必去发现它和改正它。我们一向十分注意发现工作中的缺点，而且一旦发现，就立即认真地加以纠正。正是由于我们的缺点错误属于暂时的、局部的性质，是发展中、前进中遇到的困难，所以也是可以纠正和不难纠正的；如果以幸灾乐祸的态度对待它，则是完全错误的。事实上，大跃进和人民公社运动以来出现的某些缺点，在党的领导下，有些现在正被迅速地克服着，有些则早已被克服了。
    在大跃进和人民公社运动中，发生了某些暂时的、局部的缺点错误，这自然不是我们所期望的事情；但是，在它发生了以后，却也可以转变成有益的事情。有一些缺点，例如有时劳力使用不当、农业估产偏高等，从一方面来看，这是不好的；从另一方面来看，它也反映出广大群众的冲天干劲、伟大热情，反映出他们迫切要求改变我国一穷二白境况的革命愿望。缺点和错误一定要改正，决不加以姑息；一旦改正了之后，我们就又取得了反面的经验，从比较地没有经验变得比较地有经验，我们的事业也就前进得更快。
    这就是我们对待群众运动中的成绩和缺点所应持的正确态度。
