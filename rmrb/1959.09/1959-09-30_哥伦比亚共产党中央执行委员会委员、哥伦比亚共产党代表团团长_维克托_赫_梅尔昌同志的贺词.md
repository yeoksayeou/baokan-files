Comrades:

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Colombia, through our delegation, extends brotherly revolutionary greetings to the Communist Party of China and its Central Committee, and expresses its sincerest admiration for the great cause of liberation that the Chinese people have been continuously undertaking.

    Our Colombian people are not indifferent to the great cause you are carrying out. On the contrary, they are deeply concerned about it, because we Colombians are suffering great social tragedies that have many similarities to the disasters you suffered in the past. Today's Colombia, like yesterday's China, sees American imperialism as its greatest enemy of liberation.

    In our country, there are large estate owners, and three American oil companies monopolize millions of hectares of land, which are only used for exploration or not used for production at all; our oil industry is developed by American imperialism; our most important export, coffee, is completely controlled by it; our economy is deeply interfered with by American monopoly capital, and our political and international life is also interfered with through some secret military agreements. These semi-colonial and semi-feudal situations and these facts are just a few examples to illustrate to you the extent to which our national sovereignty lacks dignity, while you possess this dignity, a dignity held in the hands of the most diligent and loyal defenders of the people, like the Communist Party representing Chinese workers and peasants today.

    Precisely because of this, our people see hope in you and hope to gain your valuable experience to help solve their problems. We believe that, in addition to the historical, economic, and social factors of our American people themselves, the historical example and influence you provide play a very significant role in the current struggle of our people to regain their democratic freedoms.

    Chinese comrades, a great revolutionary movement is currently underway in Latin America. Naturally, this movement initially starts with overthrowing domestic dictatorial rule, but, in the end, it must, like your movement, end with the formation of a great and unified movement against imperialism and for national liberation.

    The fact that representatives of the bourgeoisie and progressive intellectuals from various American countries are present here in China today, as is the case in other American countries, indicates the immense interest that has begun to manifest itself in other social strata in the Americas, namely, the desire to thoroughly understand and learn from the experience of the tremendous development achieved by the Chinese revolutionary process. This fact also marks the beginning of the formation of conditions for establishing a "United Front for Liberation" in various American countries.

    However, emphasizing the role of the Chinese people in the anti-imperialist struggle today does not mean that we forget to acknowledge the valuable contributions that the great Soviet people and their glorious Communist Party have given to the world through their example.

    The example of the October Revolution guided the struggle of people around the world and thereby established the world's first socialist society, turning the theoretical concepts of socialism into concrete reality. The economic, military, scientific, and cultural power of the Soviet Union is the most obvious proof of the greatness and correctness of scientific Marxism-Leninism.

    Our class enemies fail to recognize that unity is the great strength of us communists; they do not understand the love and unity that arises among us due to the scientific concept of eliminating inequality and discrimination between nations and between people; they do not know that our unity and belief lie in the hope we generate when we see the outstanding examples set for us by the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries; they do not know the significance that each and every one of their achievements and progress has for us communists; but it should be pointed out that, for us, every progress of the socialist camp means further consolidating peace and ensuring the friendship between nations and between people, rather than a new means of conquest and exploitation. Therefore, whenever the socialist camp is further consolidated, the people of the Americas and their Communist Parties feel that their day of liberation is not far away.

    Glory to the great Chinese people!
    Glory to the great Soviet people!
    Glory to the people of socialist countries!
    Glory to the great Communist Party of China and its Central Committee!
    Glory to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee!
    Glory to the people of the world who are fighting for liberation!
    Glory to Comrade Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live the tenth anniversary of the victory of the Chinese revolution! (Attached picture)

    哥伦比亚共产党中央执行委员会委员、哥伦比亚共产党代表团团长
    维克托·赫·梅尔昌同志的贺词同志们：
    哥伦比亚共产党中央委员会通过我们的代表团向中国共产党及其中央委员会，向伟大的中国人民致以兄弟的革命敬礼，并对中国人民一直进行的伟大的解放事业表示它最真诚的敬佩。
    我们哥伦比亚人民对你们正在进行的伟大事业并不是漠不关心的。恰好相反，对它寄于深切的关心，因为我们哥伦比亚人正遭受的巨大的社会悲剧和你们过去所遭受的灾难有许多相似之处。今天的哥伦比亚如同昨天的中国一样，它把美帝国主义看作它解放的最大敌人。
    在我们国内有大庄园主，三家美国石油公司垄断了好几百万公顷土地，而这些土地仅仅用于勘探或根本不用于生产；我国的石油工业由美帝国主义开发；我国最重要的输出品咖啡完全由它掌握；我国的经济深深地受到美国垄断资本的干涉，我国的政治和国际生活也通过一些秘密军事协定受到它的干涉。这些半殖民地半封建的情况和这些事实仅仅是几个用来向你们说明我国的民族主权缺乏尊严已经到什么程度的实例，而你们却具有这种尊严，这种尊严掌握在像今天代表着中国工人农民的共产党这样的人民最勤恳、最忠实的卫士手中。
    正因为如此，我国人民在你们身上看到了希望，并且希望获得你们宝贵的经验来帮助解决他们的问题。我们认为，除了我们美洲人民自己的历史，经济和社会因素外，你们给我们提供的历史性的榜样和影响在我们人民目前进行的争取重新获得他们的民主自由权利的斗争中起着非常重大的作用。
    中国同志们，目前在拉丁美洲正进行着一个伟大的革命运动，很自然，这运动最初从推翻本国的独裁统治开始，但是，最后必须像你们的运动一样，以形成一个反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的伟大、统一的运动告终。
    今天在这里，在中国也有美洲各国资产阶级和进步知识分子的代表人物出席，其他美洲国家也是这样，这一事实本身表明在美洲其他社会阶层中已经开始表现出来的莫大的兴趣，这就是，希望彻底了解和学习中国革命过程所取得的巨大发展的经验，这一事实也标志着在美洲各国建立一个“解放统一战线”的条件，正在开始形成。
    但是，今天我们强调指出中国人民在反帝斗争中所起的作用，这不等于说我们就忘了承认伟大的苏联人民及其光荣的共产党用它的榜样所给予世界的宝贵贡献。
    十月革命的榜样指引了世界各国人民的斗争，并由此建立了世界上第一个社会主义社会，使社会主义的理论观念变成了具体的现实。苏联的经济、军事、科学和文化的威力是科学的马克思列宁主义的伟大和正确的最明显的证明。
    我们的阶级敌人认识不到团结一致是我们共产党人的巨大力量；他们不懂得由于要消灭各民族之间和人与人之间的不平等和歧视的科学观念而在我们中间所产生的友爱与团结；他们不知道我们的团结和信念在于我们看到苏联、中国和人民民主国家人民给我们作出的卓越榜样时所产生的希望；他们不知道他们的全部和每一个成就和进步对我们共产党人所具有的意义；但是应该指出，对我们来说，社会主义阵营的每一个进步都意味着进一步巩固和平和保障各民族和人与人之间的友爱，而不是一个征服和剥削的新手段。因此，每当社会主义阵营进一步巩固，美洲各国人民及其共产党就感到他们解放的日子已经不远了。
    光荣归于伟大的中国人民！
    光荣归于伟大的苏联人民！
    光荣归于社会主义各国人民！
    光荣归于伟大的中国共产党及其中央委员会！
    光荣归于苏联共产党及其中央委员会！
    光荣归于为争取解放而斗争的世界人民！
    光荣归于中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志！
    中国革命胜利十周年万岁！（附图片）
