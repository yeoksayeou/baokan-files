This dispatch from our Chengdu office, dated September 19th, reports that the tenth autumn harvest since liberation has arrived in the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area of Sichuan Province. Millions of agricultural laborers are engaged in a vigorous battle to harvest the crops. As of September 11th, over 230,000 mu of mid-season rice have been harvested in the central area of the irrigation zone, the Western Sichuan Plain. Counties with faster progress have already completed 70% of their harvesting.

In this renowned rice-producing region, rice production has generally leapt forward again this year, building on the foundation of last year's Great Leap Forward. News of bumper harvests is constantly being reported. Xin Fan County, a banner for large-scale high rice yields in the irrigation area last year, has already harvested 80,000 mu of mid-season rice, with yields generally increasing by 10% to 20% compared to last year. The already harvested mid-season rice in other counties has also increased by about 10%. In Huaqiao Commune of Dayi County, over 10,000 mu of rice has an average yield of over 800 jin per mu. In Xinmin, Qingbai, Gaoning, and Longqiao Communes of Xin Fan County, over 20,000 mu have an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu.

    川西平原中稻大量登场
    水稻高产旗帜新繁县再破高产纪录
    本报成都19日电　四川省都江堰灌区解放后的第十个秋季大丰收已经到来，数百万农业劳动大军正在奋战抢收。截至9月11日，仅灌区中心地带的川西平原上，就已有二十三万多亩中稻登场。收割进度较快的县，已收割完70％。
    这个著名的水稻产区，在去年大跃进的基础上，今年水稻产量又普遍跃进了一大步，丰收喜讯不断传出。去年灌区水稻大面积高产的旗帜新繁县，今年已收割的八万亩中稻，一般比去年增产一成到两成。其他各县已收割的部分中稻，也增产一成左右。大邑县花桥公社一万多亩水稻，平均亩产在八百斤以上。新繁县新民、青白、高宁、龙桥等四个公社的两万多亩平均亩产都在一千斤以上。
