Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 6th: In order to adapt to the growing needs of urban and rural people for subsidiary food as their living standards continue to improve, Heilongjiang Province is actively planning to establish twenty-three larger provincial-level subsidiary food production bases while vigorously developing mass-based diversified operations and self-sufficiency production in government agencies and enterprises. This was proposed by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at a subsidiary food production base planning conference held recently in Jingpo Lake.

The conference decided to establish livestock production bases in thirteen locations, including the Xi'an Farm in Fujin County and the Xiangrong Livestock Farm in Mingshui County, which are close to feed production areas, rich in resources, and have development prospects. These bases will focus on raising pigs and poultry, and developing diversified operations. Ten aquatic production bases will be built in Xingkai Lake in Mishan County, Jingpo Lake in Ning'an County, Wudalianchi in Bei'an County, and Talahong in the Dorbod Mongol Autonomous County, focusing on fish and duck farming, and developing diversified operations. These places have broad prospects for developing subsidiary food production. For example, the livestock farm established in the Xiangrong Management Area of Mingshui County is close to a starch factory, and the starch residue can be used as feed for 10,000 to 20,000 pigs, and 15,000 commercial pigs can be produced next year. The Lianhuan Lake (Talahong) in the Dorbod Mongol Autonomous County has a water surface area of 30,000 hectares, and can produce 1,000 tons of fish this year and 2,500 tons next year.

The establishment of these subsidiary food bases can play the role of a "living warehouse," providing more commodities to the market in a short period of time. The Ya'erse Farm subsidiary food base, established in the suburbs of Qiqihar City at the beginning of last year, supplied 51 million jin of vegetables and 3 million jin of melons and fruits to the market in the second half of last year, and also supplied 190,000 jin of pork and 300,000 jin of fish at the end of the year. This year, the amount of subsidiary food provided by this farm will be even greater than last year. The Jingpo Lake Breeding Farm, an aquatic product base, supplied 560,000 jin of fresh fish to the urban people for the New Year and Spring Festival last year, and will supply more commercial fish to the market this year. Because this type of base is directly controlled by the state, it can take more when there is more to take, and less when there is less to take. It can also operate some varieties that the masses are unwilling to operate and that require a longer period of time to benefit from. It can play a demonstrative role in improving technology, promoting experience, and cultivating superior varieties. After these subsidiary food production bases are established, they will drive cities and counties to run their own production bases, gradually forming a network of large, medium and small subsidiary food production bases.

### 增加副食品生产满足市场需要  黑龙江筹建二十三个基地

    增加副食品生产满足市场需要
    黑龙江筹建二十三个基地
    新华社哈尔滨6日电　为了适应城乡人民生活在不断改善下对副食品的大量需要，黑龙江省在大搞群众性多种经营和机关企业生产自给的同时，正在积极筹划建立二十三个较大的省属副食品生产的基地。这是中共黑龙江省委最近在镜泊湖召开的副食品生产基地规划会议上提出的。
    这次会议决定，在靠近饲料产地、资源丰富、有发展前途的富锦县西安农场、明水县向荣畜牧场等十三处建立畜牧生产基地，以养猪、禽为主，发展多种经营。在密山县兴凯湖、宁安县镜泊湖、北安县五大莲池、杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县他拉洪等十处兴建水产生产基地，以养鱼养鸭为主，发展多种经营。这些地方发展副食品生产都有广阔的前途，如明水县向荣管理区建立的畜牧场，靠近淀粉厂，淀粉渣子可以做一万头到两万头猪的饲料，明年即可以出商品猪一万五千头。杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县的连环湖（他拉洪）的水面有三万公顷，今年可产鱼一千吨，明年可产二千五百吨。
    建立这些副食品基地，可以起到“活仓库”的作用，在短时间内向市场提供较多的商品。去年年初齐齐哈尔市在市郊建立的雅尔塞农场副食品基地，在去年下半年就供应了市场五千一百万斤蔬菜，三百万斤瓜果，年末还供应了十九万斤猪肉，三十万斤鱼。今年，这个场提供的副食品比去年增加的更多。水产基地镜泊湖养殖场，去年以五十六万斤鲜鱼供应了城市人民过新年和春节，今年将以更多的商品鱼供应市场。这种基地因为由国家直接掌握，可以做到多用多取，少用少取；它也可以经营一些群众不愿经营的、需要经过较长时间才能受益的品种；对提高技术、推广经验、培养优良品种等方面能起示范作用。这些副食品生产基地建立起来以后，就会带动市县办自己的生产基地，逐渐形成大、中、小型相结合的副食品生产基地网。（附图片）
