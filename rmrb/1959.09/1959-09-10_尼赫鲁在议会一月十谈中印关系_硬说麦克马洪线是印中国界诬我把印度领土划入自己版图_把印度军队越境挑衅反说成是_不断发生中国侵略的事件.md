Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, Delhi dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in a period of less than a month, from August 6th to September 4th, delivered ten speeches in the Indian Parliament regarding the Sino-Indian relations issue.

In his recent talks, Nehru focused on the Sino-Indian border issue. On August 28th, in the People's Assembly, when Nehru mentioned some incidents that occurred on the Sino-Indian border, he said, "In one or two places, there have been, and are still, continuous incidents of Chinese aggression." On August 31st, in the Council of States, he made similar remarks, even accusing China of "clear aggression."

As early as August 7th, Nehru mentioned the Sino-Indian border issue at a press conference. He said that assuming there was a dispute over the border, it might be a minor dispute, but he believed that China's map "is not a border dispute in that sense at all. The problem with the Chinese map is that China has designated a large piece of other people's territory as its own. This has been the case there since before the Communists came to power, and it is their habit."

In his talks, Nehru spoke separately about the Sino-Indian Eastern Sector boundary and the Ladakh region boundary. Regarding the Sino-Indian Eastern Sector boundary—the area where China's Tibet region borders northeastern India (referred to by India as the "Northeast Frontier Agency")—Nehru repeatedly emphasized "We insist on the McMahon Line." He said in the People's Assembly on August 13th that, as far as India is concerned, the McMahon Line is the national border, "it is immovably fixed according to treaty stipulations, immovably fixed according to custom and right, and immovably fixed geographically." He said: Zhou Enlai gave us the impression a few years ago that, considering all the circumstances, China accepts the McMahon Line as the international boundary between the two countries. On September 4th, he said again in the People's Assembly: "We believe that the Chinese government's continued publication of a map that depicts half of the Northeast Frontier Agency, one-third of Assam, and one-third of Bhutan as if they belong to China is very objectionable and very inappropriate. It is indeed an offense."

Nehru then said: "After broadly accepting the McMahon Line, I am prepared to discuss any revisions to the McMahon Line; minor revisions here or there—that is a different matter—not these large tracts of land, but minor revisions, determining whether this small hill is here, this small place is on this side or that side, based on facts, maps, and existing evidence. This is what I am prepared to discuss with the Chinese government."

Nehru reported to both houses of parliament on August 28th and 31st about some recent incidents on the Sino-Indian Eastern Sector boundary. According to him, on August 7th this year, a Chinese army "invaded" the border of Khenzemane in the Northeast Frontier Agency. On August 25th, Chinese troops again entered Indian territory south of Maja and opened fire, capturing an Indian outpost and surrounding an Indian outpost called Longju. He believed that "this problem is much more serious than some kind of accidental or unexpected border dispute." He said, "Without a doubt, it seems to us to be a clear act of aggression."

Nehru said on August 28th: "Although I don't want to make a fuss about this situation, and these incidents themselves are small incidents, the factors that led to these small incidents are a little difficult to understand. In any case, we must be vigilant and do our best to protect our borders." He said that small disputes of one mile or another on the dividing line can be discussed at the conference table, but when the problem involves large areas of territory, it is not a matter for discussion.

He also said on August 31st, "It is almost impossible for me to tell the Council of States what military or similar steps we have taken on this issue. It is impossible to prevent intrusions along a 2,000-mile border, if I may say so. But it is possible to take certain steps to repel such intrusions or strengthen our defenses. But the Council of States should remember that, while we certainly have a responsibility to defend our borders and strengthen them, thereby protecting the integrity of India, generally speaking, large countries do not suddenly start a full-scale war as if a war has broken out between them. People will consider these things, and people will try to resolve problems through discussions and other means. At the same time, people will defend themselves when attacked. For China or India, it obviously makes little difference whether one or two miles in the mountains belong to them or to us. But if treaties are violated, or an aggressive attitude is adopted, that is indeed of great significance. Where these problems occur, we must adopt a dual policy, on the one hand, of course, to defend, and on the other hand, always to solve these problems by holding meetings."

A member asked him whether the ownership of this area was in doubt, or whether India was sure that it belonged to India? Nehru replied, "Yes, the Chinese not only doubt it, but also claim that this area belongs to them. I don't know to what extent this is true."

As for the Ladakh region, Nehru said in the Council of States on August 31st, "As a result of the treaty signed in 1842 on behalf of Maharaja Gulab Singh on one side and the Guru Sahib Lama of Lhasa and the representatives of the Chinese Emperor on the other side, the entire Ladakh region, including Aksai Chin, became part of the Jammu and Kashmir State. Since then, this area has been part of the Jammu and Kashmir State. Later, British officers repeatedly attempted to delineate the boundary between the Jammu and Kashmir State and Tibet. The Chinese government was asked to send representatives to cooperate in this work. They did not participate. However, the Chinese Commissioner issued the following statement on January 13, 1847: 'Allow me to point out that the boundaries of these regions have been fully and clearly demarcated, so it is best to abide by this old arrangement, and facts will prove that it is much more convenient not to take any other measures to delineate the boundary.'" He also said on August 31st: "The Chinese have not accepted that line." He said: "This issue is clearly an issue that needs to be considered and discussed." He said again on September 4th, "The boundary between Ladakh and Tibet is not clearly demarcated. To some extent, it was delineated by British officers who went there, but I doubt whether they conducted a careful survey. They drew the line, and this line has always been marked on our maps." Prior to this, Nehru said in the People's Assembly on August 28th, "There is no actual dividing line in this entire region." "This is the border between the old Kashmir State and Tibet and Chinese Turkestan. No one has demarcated this border. However, after some rough surveys, the government at that time stipulated that border, and we have always accepted and recognized this border." He also said that there was news that China's Xinjiang-Tibet highway "passes through a corner of our (India's) northeastern Ladakh." He believed that China's map "included part of Ladakh in a very rough stroke." Nehru also talked to the parliament about some incidents that occurred in the western sector of the Sino-Indian border. He said that from October 1957 to February 1958, Chinese troops "crossed the international border." In July this year, an Indian reconnaissance team sent out was captured by Chinese troops and later released.

Regarding the future of Sino-Indian relations, Nehru said in the People's Assembly on September 4th, "Now, in my opinion, if we develop some kind of long-term state of hostility with China, in the future, it will not only be a tragedy for India and possibly for China, but also a tragedy for Asia and the whole world. If you are weak, if you are considered a weak country, there will be no natural friendship. There can be no friendship between the weak and the strong, nor can there be friendship between countries that try to bully others and countries that are bullied. This does not happen regardless of individual or collective or national. Only when people are more or less equal, and people respect each other, are they friends. The same is true for countries. But the problem is that we are indeed working for Indo-China friendship. Can I say that, despite what has happened and what is happening now, this is still our goal, and we will continue to work for it. But this does not mean that we should give up what we believe is right, or that we should cede part of Indian territory to China to please it. This is not the way to make friends with anyone or maintain our dignity and self-respect. But in the long run, it is important that these two great countries should become friends, regardless of their internal structures and policies."

Nehru also repeatedly talked about news in the newspapers such as so-called "Communist agents talking about China liberating Bhutan and Sikkim at a mass meeting in Lhasa"; China's desire to establish a "federation" including Sikkim, Bhutan, and Assam; "China conducting propaganda in Sikkim saying that Bhutan and Sikkim will return to China's embrace in the next few years." He said in the People's Assembly on August 28th, "We cannot verify whether this news is true. This news certainly causes anxiety among the people of Sikkim, Bhutan, and other places in the Indian border regions. Our attitude is very clear. The Indian government has the responsibility to protect the borders of Sikkim and Bhutan, as well as the territorial integrity of these two countries; any aggression against Bhutan and Sikkim will be regarded as aggression against India." In his speech, he also mentioned that Chinese troops "may have occasionally threatened" the people of Bhutan.

Nehru also spoke in Parliament about trade issues between India and China's Tibet region, the issue of "people of Indian descent" in Tibet, and the issue of Indian pilgrims going to Tibet. Nehru again talked about his views on the Tibetan rebellion on September 4th in the People's Assembly. He repeated what he had said many times in the past, "deep sympathy for the suffering of the Tibetan people," "China's ruling position in Tibet," "the collapse of Tibetan autonomy," and that the reason for the Tibetan rebellion was "strong nationalist sentiment," etc. Nehru also expressed his disapproval of submitting the Tibetan issue to the United Nations.

    尼赫鲁在议会一月十谈中印关系
    硬说麦克马洪线是印中国界诬我把印度领土划入自己版图
    把印度军队越境挑衅反说成是“不断发生中国侵略的事件”
    新华社9日讯　新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁在从8月6日到9月4日不到一个月的期间内，曾经先后十次在印度议会上发表有关中印两国关系问题的谈话。
    尼赫鲁在最近几次谈话中，着重谈到中印边界问题。8月28日在人民院，尼赫鲁在提到一些在中印边境上发生的事件时说，“在一两处地方，曾经发生过而且现在还不断发生中国侵略的事件。”8月31日在联邦院，他又提出了类似的说法，竟然指责中国进行“明白的侵略”。
    早在8月7日，尼赫鲁已经在一次记者招待会上提到了中印边界问题，他说，假定发生了关于边界的争端，这可能是小争端，但是，他认为中国的地图“根本不是在这个意义上的边界争端，中国地图的问题是，中国把别人一大块领土划作自己的领土。在那里，在共产党执政以前就一直有这种情况，这是他们的习惯。”
    尼赫鲁在谈话中分别谈到了关于中印东段边界和拉达克地区边界问题。关于中印东段边界——中国的西藏地方同印度东北部接界地区（印度称为“东北边境特区”），尼赫鲁一再强调“我们坚持麦克马洪线”。他8月13日在人民院说，就印度而言，麦克马洪线是国界线，“这根据条约规定是确定不移的，根据惯例和权利也是确定不移的，而从地理上来说，也是确定不移的”。他说：周恩来在几年以前给我们的印象是：考虑到一切的情况，中国接受麦克马洪线是两国之间的国际疆界。9月4日，他又在人民院说：“我们认为，中国政府继续出版一种地图，把东北边境特区的一半、阿萨姆的三分之一和不丹的三分之一画得好像是属于中国的地方，这是非常应当反对和非常不适当的。这的确是一种冒犯。”
    尼赫鲁接着说：“在大体上接受麦克马洪线之后，我准备讨论对麦克马洪线的任何修正；在这里或那里的次要修正——这是不同的问题——，不是这些大块领土，而是次要的修正，究竟这个小山是在这里，这块小地方是在那边或这边，都根据事实，根据地图和现有的证据来确定。这是我准备同中国政府讨论的。”
    尼赫鲁曾经在8月28日和31日向议会两院报告了最近在中印东段边界发生的一些事件。据他说，今年8月7日，有一支中国军队“侵犯”了东北边境特区坚则马尼的边界。8月25日，又有中国军队在马及墩以南的地方进入印度地区并且开了火，俘虏了印度的一支前哨队，还包围了一个叫作朗久的印度前哨站。他认为，“这个问题比起某种偶然或意外的边境纠纷来要严重得多。”他说，“毫无疑问，在我们看来这是一个明白的侵略事件。”
    尼赫鲁在8月28日说：“虽然我不愿意对这种局势大惊小怪，而这些事件本身也都是小事件，但是促使这些小事件发生的因素是有点难于了解的。无论如何，我们必须警惕，必须尽力保护我们的边境。”他说，在分界线上这一英里那一英里的小争论可以在会议桌上讨论，但是问题涉及大片领土时就不是讨论的问题了。
    他在8月31日又说，“我几乎不可能告诉联邦院，我们在这种问题上已经采取了什么军事的或者这一类的步骤。要防止两千英里长的边界上的入侵活动是不可能的，如果我可以这么说的话。但是采取某些步骤来击退这种入侵活动或者加强我们的防务是可能的。但是联邦院应该记住，虽然我们当然有责任保卫我们的边境并且加强它们，从而保护印度的完整，但是通常就大国来说，人们不会好像它们之间发生了战争一样，突然动手，全面地打起来。人们会考虑这些事情，人们会设法通过讨论等办法来解决问题。同时，人们在受到进攻的时候会进行自卫。对于中国或者印度说来，高山中的一两英里的地方究竟属于他们还是属于我们，实际上显然没有多大差别。但是，如果条约遭到破坏，或者采取了侵略性的态度，那的确是有重大关系的。在发生这些问题的地方，我们必须采取双重的政策，一方面当然是要进行防御，另一方面始终要通过举行会议的办法解决这些问题。”
    有议员问他，这个地区的所有权是不是有疑问，或者说，印度是不是肯定它是属于印度的？尼赫鲁答复说，“有的，中国人不仅怀疑，而且还声称这一地带归他们所有。我不知道这话在多大程度上是正确的。”
    至于拉达克地区，尼赫鲁8月31日在联邦院说，“由于在1842年代表古拉布辛大君一方和拉萨的古鲁萨希布喇嘛和中国皇帝的代表另一方签订的条约的结果，整个拉达克地区，包括阿克赛钦，成为查谟和克什米尔邦的一部分。自从那时以来，这个地区就成为查谟和克什米尔邦的一部分。后来，英国军官曾屡次企图划定查谟和克什米尔邦同西藏之间的边界。曾经要求中国政府派代表合作来做这个工作。他们没有参加。但是，中国专员在1847年1月13日曾发表声明如下：‘请容许我指出，这些地区的边界已经充分地、明确地划定了，因此最好是遵守这项古老的安排，事实将会证明不再另外采取任何划定边界的措施要方便得多。’”他在8月31日还说：“中国人没有接受那条线。”他说：“这个问题显然是一个需要考虑和讨论的问题。”他在9月4日又说，“拉达克同西藏的边界不是明确划定的。在某种程度上，它为前往那里的英国军官所划定，但是我怀疑他们是否仔细进行过勘察，他们把线划出来了，这条线一直标在我们的地图上。”在这以前，尼赫鲁8月28日在人民院说，“在整个这一地区，并没有实际的分界线。”“这是老的克什米尔邦同西藏和中国土耳其斯坦的疆界。没有谁划定过这条疆界。但是，经过某种概略的勘察以后，当时的政府规定了那条边界，我们一直接受并承认这条边界。”他又说，有消息说，中国的新藏公路“穿过了我们（印度）拉达克东北部的一角”。他认为，中国的地图“大笔一挥就很粗略地把拉达克的一部分地区包括进去了”。尼赫鲁也向议会谈到了在中印边界西段发生的一些事件。他说，从1957年10月到1958年2月，中国军队“越过国际边界”，今年7月，印度派去的一支侦察队被中国军队俘虏，后来又放回。
    关于今后中印关系，尼赫鲁9月4日在人民院说，“现在，在我看来，如果我们同中国发展了某种长期的敌对状态，在将来，这不仅对印度和可能对中国来说会是一个悲剧，而且对亚洲和全世界来说也会是一个悲剧。如果你是软弱的，如果你被认为是一个软弱的国家，就不会有自然的友谊。在弱者和强者之间不可能存在友谊，在企图欺负别人的国家和被欺负的国家之间也不可能存在友谊。不论个人或集体或国家，都不会发生这种情况。只有在人们多少是平等的，人们互相尊敬的时候，他们才是朋友。国家也是一样。可是问题在于我们的确为印中友谊而努力。我是不是可以说，尽管有着已经发生的和现在正在发生的事情，这仍旧是我们的目的，我们将继续为此努力。可是这并不意味着我们应该放弃我们认为是正确的事情，或者我们应该让出一部分印度领土给中国，来讨好它。这并不是同任何人交朋友或者保持我们的尊严和自尊的方法。可是从长远看来，重要的是，这两个大国应该成为朋友，不论它们内部的结构和政策如何。”
    尼赫鲁还多次谈到了报纸上的这类消息：所谓“共产党代理人在拉萨的群众大会上谈到中国要解放不丹和锡金”；中国要建立包括锡金、不丹和阿萨姆邦的“联邦”；“中国在锡金进行宣传说，不丹和锡金今后几年内会回到中国的怀抱。”他8月28日在人民院说，“我们无法查核这些消息是否真实。这种消息当然引起了锡金、不丹和印度边境地区的其它地方的人民的忧虑。我们的态度是十分清楚的。印度政府有责任保护锡金和不丹的边境以及这两个国家的领土完整；对不丹和锡金的任何侵略将被看作是对印度的侵略。”他在谈话中还提到中国军队对不丹人民“可能偶尔进行过一些威胁”。
    尼赫鲁在议会上还谈到关于印度和中国西藏地方的贸易问题、在西藏的“印度血统的人”问题、印度香客前往西藏的问题等。尼赫鲁9月4日在人民院又谈到他对西藏叛乱事件的看法。他重复了过去多次说过的，“对西藏人民的苦难怀有深切的同情”、“中国对西藏的统治地位”、“西藏自治垮台了”、西藏叛乱的原因是“强烈的民族主义感情”等说法。尼赫鲁还表示不赞成把西藏事件提交联合国。
