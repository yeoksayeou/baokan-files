I. The Life Cycle of a Typhoon

According to observations over many years, June to October is the most active period for storms over the tropical oceans of the Northern Hemisphere. Tropical storms with a certain intensity are called hurricanes in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific, storms in the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean, and typhoons in the Western Pacific, including the Philippines, Japan, and the East China Sea. The formation and development of a typhoon generally goes through five stages: 1. Incubation Stage. At this time, disturbances have formed in the lower tropical atmosphere, but the low-pressure circulation on the ground is not very obvious. Convective clouds are more developed in the area where the disturbance forms, often accompanied by thunderstorms, and the wind force begins to increase. Although the ground pressure in these areas is not necessarily lower than elsewhere, it generally drops to around 1000 millibars (a millibar is a unit of pressure, indicating the force per unit area). 2. Tropical Depression Stage. If the disturbance formed in the first stage develops under appropriate conditions into an obvious wave or a closed cyclonic circulation (air rotating counterclockwise around a vertical axis), then the ground pressure will continue to drop, the convective cloud system and thunderstorms will intensify, and the wind force will increase. At this time, a closed low-pressure area can often be drawn on the surface weather map, with the maximum wind force near the center reaching level 6. This stage can also be called the infancy of a typhoon. 3. Tropical Storm Stage. If that infant tropical depression does not die young and continues to develop, then the cyclonic circulation at high altitude and on the ground will deepen significantly. Several closed circular isobars (lines connecting points with equal pressure values) can be drawn on the weather map, with the wind force near the center generally above level 6 and below level 12. The original showers then develop into heavy showers or continuous heavy rain. This stage is like the youth of a human body, full of vitality, and begins to move westward. 4. Typhoon Stage. If the tropical storm continues to develop, with the wind force near the center reaching level 12 or above, accompanied by heavy rain, it becomes a typhoon. At this time, the central pressure drops to the lowest value, generally below 980 millibars, the range of strong winds is the widest, and the center continues to move westward or northwestward, usually at a slow speed. This stage is like the prime of a human body, and all aspects seem to be relatively fixed. 5. Decay Stage. During the third and fourth stages of typhoon development, it usually moves westward or northwestward. Due to the northward component, it gradually moves from its birthplace – the tropical ocean – into the temperate zone. If its path is very westward, it can land on the southeast coast of China. After landing, the typhoon weakens significantly due to ground friction and massive energy consumption. If it penetrates deep inland, even a strong typhoon will tend to disappear. If it does not penetrate deeply inland, it will be affected by the mid-latitude westerly airflow. When cold air from the subtropics penetrates the typhoon body, it will cause the temperature difference in the typhoon to increase and a front (a narrow zone with the largest temperature difference in the atmosphere) to form. At this time, the typhoon transforms into a temperate cyclone and moves in a northeasterly direction. The moving speed usually increases significantly, and the typhoon's circulation gradually weakens or even disappears. These are the typical development stages of a typhoon, but there are also cases that do not go through these stages, because the phased nature of typhoon development also varies greatly with the season and latitude.

II. The Structure of a Typhoon

The surface weather map shows that a typhoon is approximately a concentric circle composed of a set of closed isobars. The closer to the typhoon center, the closer the concentric circles are, which means that the closer to the center, the faster the pressure decreases. The pressure difference near the center reaches its maximum. Therefore, when a typhoon approaches a certain area, the air pressure initially drops slowly. About three hours before the typhoon center passes through the area, the air pressure drops particularly sharply, and then rises sharply at the same rate after it passes. Therefore, the curve of air pressure change forms a funnel shape before and after the typhoon passes.

The wind direction inside the typhoon rotates counterclockwise around the center and blows towards the center. According to the pressure distribution described above, the wind force of a typhoon is strongest near its center, generally reaching 60 knots/hour (1 knot is approximately equal to 1.8 kilometers) or more. Generally speaking, the wind force is greater to the right of the typhoon's direction of travel than to the left, because there is usually high pressure to the right of the typhoon's direction of travel, so the isobars in this area are the most dense, and the wind force is also the greatest.

The rainfall situation inside the typhoon is also a very important issue. Because many factors affect rainfall, the certainty of the answer to this question is obviously much smaller than the previous two questions. Generally speaking, it is not uncommon for a typhoon to drop 400 to 500 millimeters of rain after it passes, and it is common for it to drop 200 to 300 millimeters. Once a typhoon passed through the Philippines, it rained a total of about 2,500 millimeters, which is almost three or four times the annual rainfall in temperate regions. The wind force is the greatest near the center of the typhoon, so the horizontal convergence and vertical uplift of air are also the strongest, so the rain intensity and rainfall in the central part are also the greatest. The total amount of rainfall when a typhoon passes through a place is obviously also closely related to its moving speed. If the typhoon moves very slowly, then the total amount of rainfall in the places it passes through will be considerable. Conversely, if the typhoon itself is not very strong and moves very quickly, then the amount of rainfall in the places it passes through will not be large.

Since World War II, high-altitude observation networks have developed significantly. It has become possible to observe the three-dimensional structure of typhoons using radiosondes, radar, and aircraft. Therefore, meteorologists from various countries have begun to study the structure of typhoons in three dimensions. The first result of this research is to clarify that the vertical thickness of a typhoon at its peak can reach the upper part of the troposphere, that is, the vertical thickness of a typhoon can exceed ten kilometers. It was also found that the axis of the lowest air pressure in the typhoon center below five kilometers is close to vertical, while it tilts backward above five kilometers. According to the concept of hydrostatic equilibrium of air pressure, the temperature in the center of a deep low-pressure area existing in the atmosphere should be lower than that around it, that is, deep low-pressure areas are cold. Regarding the temperature structure of typhoons, before radiosondes were available, meteorologists made various hypotheses based on phenomena observed on the ground. Some argued that typhoons, like general deep low-pressure areas, are cold, while others believed that they are warm. In recent years, according to high-altitude sounding data, it has been proven that the vicinity of the typhoon center is very warm from the ground to high altitude, and the warmest area is between three kilometers and nine kilometers. Therefore, it can be determined that the temperature structure of a typhoon is different from that of a general deep low-pressure area and is warm. It can be seen that the concept of hydrostatic equilibrium of air pressure is not applicable in typhoons. Based on the extremely strong convective cloud systems and very intense rainfall in typhoons, it is not difficult to infer that extremely strong updrafts prevail in typhoons. However, to date, the meteorological community does not have instruments to measure vertical airflow velocity, so there is no way to directly study the distribution of vertical airflow within typhoons. Indirect calculations show that updrafts prevail within 500 kilometers from the center, while downdrafts prevail outside 500 kilometers, but for each specific typhoon, the distribution of updrafts and downdrafts is far from this strict boundary. Generally speaking, the range of updrafts is proportional to the horizontal scale of the typhoon.

The most bizarre feature of a typhoon is the existence of a typhoon eye, which is calm and clear, and the wind speed can generally be reduced to 15 knots/hour, or sometimes even as low as 5 knots/hour. The diameter of the typhoon eye varies greatly. When a typhoon is just forming, the diameter of the eye is the smallest, about four miles (1 mile is approximately equal to 1.6 kilometers). As the typhoon develops, the eye area gradually expands, and the eye of a large typhoon can be more than forty miles wide. When a typhoon transforms into a temperate cyclone, the signs of the eye area gradually disappear.

A Canadian meteorologist, Longley, made an approximate estimate of how many atomic bombs the energy of a typhoon is equivalent to. According to calculations based on a hurricane (i.e., typhoon) that passed through Florida from September 20 to 23, 1948, its energy was equivalent to the energy of 200,000 atomic bombs that exploded in Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.

III. Several Theories on Typhoon Formation

One of the oldest theories about typhoon formation is the convection hypothesis. This hypothesis holds that when a large group of cumulonimbus clouds and rapid thunderstorms occur over a tropical ocean, the vertical convection of air in that area is very strong, and the vertical instability of the tropical atmosphere is conducive to maintaining and developing this convection. When the ground air strongly convects upward, the surrounding air converges into the convection area to replenish it. At this time, if the amount of air diverging outward at high altitude is greater than the amount converging inward from the surrounding low altitude, the air pressure in the convection area will decrease. On the other hand, on the rotating Earth, air particles are also subject to the Earth's rotation deflection force when they move. In the Northern Hemisphere, this force deflects air particles to the right of the direction of movement. Therefore, the converging air forms a counterclockwise rotating vortex, and the typhoon develops from this vortex. It can be seen that near the equator, because the Earth's rotation deflection force is close to zero, even if there is air convergence, it will not form a vortex, and therefore no typhoons will be produced. According to many years of observation, it is extremely rare for typhoons to form south of 5 degrees north latitude. However, the convection hypothesis can only effectively explain climatological facts such as the areas where typhoons occur and the seasons in which they frequently occur, but it cannot explain the specific process of the formation of a particular typhoon. Around 1920, some people began to use the polar front theory of mid-high latitude cyclone generation to explain the formation process of tropical depressions. According to this theory, the airflow convergence zone in the tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is regarded as an inclined surface with density discontinuity (i.e., a front). When the airflow on both sides of this surface is reversed or the flow velocity is very different, waves will be generated on the surface. If this wave is unstable, its amplitude will become larger and larger. At this time, the air pressure near the crest of the wave will decrease, and the air pressure near the trough of the wave will increase. Therefore, a low-pressure area will form near the crest of the wave, which is the embryo of a typhoon. Although this front hypothesis seems to be a step forward compared to the convection hypothesis, it still has not been able to explain the physical mechanism of typhoon formation. On the other hand, later sounding observation data showed that the thermal structure of the tropical atmosphere is much more uniform than that of the mid-high latitude atmosphere, and it is very difficult to form a discontinuity surface of air density there.

After World War II, the accumulation of relatively rich meteorological observation data over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans provided favorable conditions for the study of tropical depression formation. From the analysis of daily high-altitude weather maps, people discovered an interesting new fact: that waves occurring in the mid-latitude westerly belt often move from west to east, while waves occurring in the tropical easterly belt often move from east to west. Therefore, westerly waves and easterly waves often approach or even overlap each other. When two waves overlap, the air pressure in the eastern part of the wave drops sharply, while the air pressure in the western part rises sharply. Therefore, in the original tropical ocean surface where the air pressure is relatively uniform, a low-pressure area is generated in the eastern part of the wave. Under appropriate conditions, this low-pressure area will develop into a tropical storm or typhoon. In 1956, Mr. Li Xianzhi of China, in view of the fact that previous hypotheses on typhoon formation could only discuss the problem from a certain perspective, which was not comprehensive, believed that it was necessary to start from observed phenomena and statistical facts, and use a comprehensive comparative analysis method to find out the spatiotemporal relationships between various phenomena and the mutual influence between different factors. Based on the internal cause of typhoon formation and the external cause as a condition, a thorough investigation of the generation of tropical depressions should be carried out. It was on this basis that Mr. Li put forward the comprehensive theory of typhoon formation. The comprehensive theory holds that the internal cause of typhoon generation is the existence of large-scale moist and unstable air, because this air contains a large amount of unstable potential energy that can be converted into the huge kinetic energy of typhoon rotation. The external cause of typhoon generation is the external force that can cause strong disturbances in large-scale moist and unstable air, resulting in the release and intensification of large amounts of potential energy. Mr. Li first discovered that this external force is the invasion of sufficiently strong cold air, especially the invasion of cold air originating from the Southern Hemisphere, because the dynamic force added by the invasion of cold air can promote the generation of typhoons. In recent years, the Shanghai Central Meteorological Observatory, in analyzing equatorial weather maps, has found that the generation of typhoons is closely related to the outbreak of cold waves in the Southern Hemisphere. This fact exactly confirms the spirit of the comprehensive theory.

However, typhoon formation is a very complex process, and the physical mechanisms involved still need to be further studied by meteorologists in the future.

IV. How to Forecast Typhoon Movement

Years of observation show that almost all tropical depressions move westward after leaving their source area and enter the westerly belt along the edge of the subtropical high-pressure area in a parabolic trajectory. The same is true for typhoons that occur in the Southwest Pacific. A small portion of them move westward through the Philippines and the South China Sea to the coastal areas of South China and disappear, while most of them first move westward after forming, gradually turning from west to northwest, and turn near 25 degrees north latitude, changing to northeast, and moving northeastward near Japan. Generally speaking, the path of typhoon movement is most westward in July, and then gradually shifts eastward month by month, and slightly shifts westward again in November. The turning point of its path from northwest to northeast is most northward in August, and then pushed southward month by month, reaching around 20 degrees north latitude in November. For each specific typhoon, the difference between its path and turning point and the above average situation is very large. Therefore, when judging the future direction of a typhoon, it is necessary to analyze the temperature and pressure field structure over the entire Eurasian sky at that time, especially the direction of the basic airflow near the typhoon and the changes in its intensity. Typhoons are controlled by the basic airflow, which has become the basic concept for forecasting typhoon paths, and the direction and intensity changes of the basic airflow are closely related to the changes in the temperature and pressure structure of the entire air layer over a large area. Therefore, the prerequisite for making a correct typhoon path forecast is to have a correct understanding of the high-altitude temperature and pressure field at that time, so as to estimate the most likely future changes in the temperature and pressure field, in order to accurately estimate the direction and intensity of the basic airflow.

In addition to moving along the basic airflow, typhoons themselves also have small oscillations. Mr. Ye Duzheng of China was the first to provide a theoretical explanation for the possibility of typhoon oscillations. Therefore, when forecasting typhoon paths, it is also necessary to estimate the small oscillations that may occur in the short term. China's years of forecasting practice have also accumulated many useful empirical rules for typhoon path forecasting. These empirical rules generally start from the changes in the meteorological elements around the typhoon and are more effective for forecasting the short-term path of the typhoon.

Although typhoons are a kind of disastrous weather system, with meteorological stations, the location of typhoons can be discovered and their movements can be watched at any time. In addition, under the leadership of the Party, the people of our coastal areas have gained rich experience in typhoon defense, and the damage caused by typhoons will definitely be reduced to a minimum. With the development of science, mankind will surely be able to find ways to gradually conquer typhoons.

    台风的形成、发展及移动
    中央气象局气象科学研究所　章基嘉
    一、台风的生命史
    根据许多年以来观测的结果，6月到10月是北半球热带洋面上风暴最活跃的时期。具有一定强度的热带风暴在大西洋和东太平洋称为飓风，在印度洋孟加拉湾一带就统称为风暴，在西太平洋菲律宾、日本及我国东海一带则称之为台风。台风的形成和发展一般分为五个阶段：一、酝酿阶段。这时在热带低层大气中已有扰动形成，但地面上的低气压环流还不很明显。在扰动形成的地方对流性的云比别处明显发展，经常伴有雷阵雨，风力开始加大，虽然这些地方的地面气压还不见得比别处低，但一般都降到1000毫巴（毫巴是一个压强单位，表示单位面积上所受到的力）左右。二、热带低压阶段。如果第一阶段中形成的扰动得到适当条件发展成为明显的波动或者是闭合的气旋性环流（空气绕着垂直轴作反时针旋转），则地面上的气压就会继续下降，对流性云系和雷阵雨加强，风力加大，这时在地面天气图上经常可以画出一个闭合的低气压，其中心附近的最大风力可以达到六级。这一阶段也可以称为台风的幼年时期。三、热带风暴阶段。如果那个幼年的热带低压并不夭折，继续发展，则高空和地面上的气旋性环流显著地加深，天气图上就可以画出好几根闭合圆形的等压线（气压值相等各点的连线），中心附近的风力一般在六级以上，十二级以下，原来的阵雨这时则发展为大阵雨或连续性的大雨。这个阶段好比人体成长的青年时期一样，富有活力，开始向西行动。四、台风阶段。热带风暴继续发展，中心附近风力达到十二级以上，并伴有大暴雨，就成为台风。这时中心气压降到最低值，一般在980毫巴以下，大风范围最广，中心继续向西或西北移动，速度通常很缓慢。这个阶段好比人体成长的壮年时期，各方面似乎比较定形了。五、衰灭阶段。在台风发展的第三和第四阶段中，通常向西或西北方向移动，由于偏北分量的存在，从它的诞生地——热带洋面——渐渐移进温带，如果它的移径很偏西，则可以在我国东南沿海登陆，登陆后的台风，由于地面摩擦，能量大量消耗，因而显著减弱。如果深入陆地很远，即使是强大的台风也要趋于消灭。如果入陆不深就受到了中纬度西风气流的影响，当亚温带的冷空气渗入台风本体时，就会引起台风中温差加大而有锋面（大气中温差最大的狭窄地带）形成。这时台风转变为温带气旋，转向东北方向移去。移速通常都会显著加大，而台风的环流则渐趋减弱乃至消灭。这是台风的典型的发展阶段，也有不经过这几个阶段的。因为台风发展的阶段性还随季节和纬度高低而有很大变化。
    二、台风的构造
    地面天气图表明，台风近似于由一组闭合等压线构成的同心圆，愈近台风中心同心圆愈靠得紧，也就是说愈接近中心，气压减低得愈快。中心附近的气压差别达到最大。所以当台风接近某地的时候，该地气压最初徐徐下降，大约在台风中心通过该地三小时以前气压下降特别急骤，通过后随即又以同样比例急升，所以在气压变化的曲线上台风经过前后就形成一个漏斗的形状。
    台风内的风向是围绕中心呈反时针旋转的，并且吹向中心。根据上面讲的气压分布情形看，台风风力在其中心附近最强，一般都可以达到六十浬／时（1浬约等于1.8公里）以上。一般说来，台风前进方向的右方风力比左方大，这是因为台风前进的右方通常存在高气压，所以这个区域内的等压线最为密集，风力也最大。
    台风内部降雨的情形也是一个很重要的问题。由于影响降雨的因子很多，对于这个问题回答的肯定性显然也要比前述两个问题小得多。一般说来，一次台风经过后，下降四、五百毫米的雨量并不稀罕，而下降两三百毫米则是常见的事。有一次台风经过菲律宾时总共下了二千五百毫米左右的雨，这几乎是温带地方全年雨量的三四倍。台风中心附近的风力最大，因而空气的水平辐合和垂直上升也最强，所以中心部分的雨势和雨量也最大。台风经过一地时降落的总雨量显然还同它的移速密切相关。如果台风移动很慢，那么所经过的地方的总雨量就相当可观。反之，台风本身不甚强，而移动又甚快，那么所经过的地方雨量也就不大。
    第二次世界大战以后，高空观测网有了显著的发展，利用无线电探空仪，雷达和飞机作台风立体结构的观测已经成为可能。因此各国的气象学家们开始了对台风的构造进行三度空间的研究。这种研究的结果，首先是明确了最盛期的台风垂直厚度可以达到对流层的上部，也就是说台风的垂直厚度可以超过十公里。同时还发现在五公里以下台风中心气压最低的轴是接近垂直的，而在五公里以上则向后倾。按气压静力平衡的观念，大气中存在的深厚低气压中心温度应比四周低，也就是说深厚的低气压都是属于冷性的。关于台风的温度结构，在没有无线电探空仪以前，气象学家们根据地面上观测到的现象作了各种假说，有的主张台风和一般深厚的低气压一样属于冷性的，有的则认为是暖性的。近年来根据高空探测的资料证明，台风中心附近由地面到高空都是很暖的，而且由三公里到九公里之间是最暖的区域。因此可以判定台风的温度结构和一般深厚的低气压不同，是属于暖性的，可见气压的静力平衡观念在台风中是不适用的。根据台风中发展极强的对流性云系和强度很大的降雨，不难推测台风中盛行着极强的上升气流。但是到目前为止，气象界还没有测量垂直气流速度的仪器，因此对于台风内垂直气流如何分布的问题还没有办法进行直接的研究。间接计算的结果得出：由中心向外五百公里以内盛行上升气流，而五百公里以外则是下沉气流，但是对于每个具体台风来说，上升和下沉气流的分布远没有这种严格的界限。一般说上升气流的范围与台风的水平尺度成正比。
    台风最令人离奇的特征是有一个台风眼存在，眼区内平静明朗，风速一般可减至十五浬／时，有时甚至小到五浬／时。台风眼的直径变化很大，在台风刚形成的时候，眼的直径最小，约四哩（1哩约等于1.6公里），随着台风发展，眼区也逐渐扩大，大台风的眼则可以宽到四十多哩。当台风转变为温带气旋时，眼区的迹象逐渐趋于消失。
    一位加拿大气象学家龙格耐对台风能量相当于多少个原子弹的能量作了近似推算。根据1948年9月20—23日经过佛罗利达地方的一个飓风（即台风）计算，它的能量相当于第二次世界大战中在日本广岛爆炸的原子弹二十万个的能量。
    三、台风形成的几种学说
    关于台风形成的一种最老的学说是对流假说。这个假说认为当热带海洋上有一大群积雨云和急剧的雷阵雨发生时，该地区空气的垂直对流运动十分强烈，而热带大气的垂直不稳定性又有利于这种对流运动的保持和发展。当地面空气强烈地对流上升时，四周围的空气便向对流区辐合补充，这时若对流上升的空气在高层向外辐散的量大于低空四周辐合进来的量时，对流发生区的气压就会降低，另一方面在自转的地球上当空气质点运动时还要受到地球自转偏向力的作用，在北半球这个力使空气质点偏向运动方向的右边，因此辐合的空气便构成一个反时针旋转的涡旋，台风就是从这个涡旋中发展起来的。由此可见，在赤道附近由于地球自转偏向力近于零，即使有空气辐合也不会形成涡旋，因而也不会有台风产生。根据多年观测结果，台风在北纬五度以南形成是极为稀罕的。然而对流假说只能对台风发生的地区及经常发生的季节等气候学的事实给予有效说明，却不能说明某一个台风具体形成的过程。约在1920年左右，有人开始用中高纬度气旋生成的极锋理论去解释热带低气压的形成过程。根据这一理论，把北半球热带中存在的气流辐合带看作是密度不连续的倾斜面（即锋面），当这个面的两侧气流反向或流速悬殊时面上就会产生波动。假使这个波动是不稳定的，其振幅就会愈来愈大，这时波峰附近的气压下降，波谷附近气压上升，于是在波峰附近就会形成一个低气压区，它就是台风发生的胚胎。虽然这个锋面假说看起来比对流假说进了一步，但是仍没有能够说明台风形成的物理机制，另一方面，后来探空观测资料说明热带大气比起中高纬度大气的热力结构要均匀得多，在那里空气密度的不连续面是十分难以构成的。
    第二次世界大战以后大西洋和太平洋上积累了比较丰富的气象观测资料，给热带低压形成的研究提供了有利条件。从日常高空天气图的分析中，人们发现了一个有趣的新事实：即中纬度西风带里发生的波动经常由西向东移动，而热带上空东风带里发生的波动则经常由东向西运行，因此西风带波动和东风带波动常有逼近乃至互相重叠的时候，两个波动发生重叠时，波动东部的气压剧然下降，而西部则剧然上升，因此在原来气压比较均匀的热带洋面上，波动的东部就有低气压产生。在适当的条件下这个低气压就会发展成为热带风暴或台风。1956年我国李宪之先生鉴于以前各种台风形成的假说都只能从某一角度来讨论问题，有失全面。他认为必须从观测到的现象和统计事实出发，用全面的比较分析法找出各种现象间的时空关系，和不同因子间的互相影响，而以台风形成的内因为根据，外因为条件，对热带低气压的生成进行彻底的推究。就在这个基础上李先生提出了台风形成的综合学说。综合学说认为台风生成的内因是大规模的潮湿不稳定的空气的存在，因为这种空气中饱含大量的不稳定潜能可以转变为台风旋转的巨大动能。台风生成的外因是能使大规模潮湿不稳定空气发生强烈的扰动，致使大量潜能释放加强上升运动的外力。这种外力，李先生首先发现是足够强烈的冷空气的侵袭，特别是从南半球发源的冷空气的侵袭，因为冷空气侵袭时所加来的动力，可以促使台风的生成。近年来上海中心气象台在分析赤道天气图时，发现台风的生成与南半球寒潮爆发有密切关系，这一事实正好与综合学说的精神互为印证。
    但是，台风形成是一个非常复杂的过程，其中的物理机制还有待于气象工作者们今后进一步研究。
    四、怎样预告台风移动
    多年的观测事实表明，几乎所有的热带低气压离开源地后都向西移动，并绕着副热带高气压的边缘以抛物线的轨迹进入西风带。西南太平洋上所发生的台风也是如此。其中一少部分向西移动中由菲律宾经中国南海到达华南沿海一带消失，而大部分在形成以后，先向西进，逐渐由西转为西北，而于北纬二十五度附近转向，改向东北，在日本附近向东北方移去。一般来说台风移动的路径在7月份最偏西，以后逐月向东偏，到11月又略向西偏。其行径由西北向转为东北向的转向点8月最偏北，以后逐月南推，11月推到北纬二十度附近。对于每个具体台风来说，其行径和转向点与上述平均的情况出入非常大，因此在判断台风未来的移向时，必须分析当时整个欧亚上空的温压场结构，尤其是台风附近的基本气流方向及其盛衰的变化。台风受基本气流操纵，已经成为预报台风路径的基础观念，而基本气流的方向和强度变化是与大范围整个空气层的温压结构变化有密切关系的。所以作出正确的台风路径预报的前提是必须对当时高空温压场有一个正确认识，从而估计温压场未来最可能的变化，以便确切地估计出来基本气流的走向和强度。
    台风除了顺着基本气流移动外，本身还有小的摆动，我国叶笃正先生首先对台风的摆动的可能性给予理论上的说明。所以在预告台风路径时还必须估计短时期内可能发生的小摆动。我国多年的预报的实践也已经积累了许多有益的台风路径预告经验规则，这种经验规则一般从台风外围气象要素发生的变化出发，对预告台风短时期的行径是比较有效的。
    台风虽然是一种灾害性的天气系统，但是，有了气象台就能随时发现台风的所在和窥视它的行动。再加上我国沿海人民在党的领导下，在防台斗争上已经取得了丰富的经验，台风给予我们的灾害一定会减到最小程度。随着科学的发展，人类一定能够找到逐步征服台风的途径的。
