Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 4th: Benxi Iron and Steel Company's steel plant, in collaboration with the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has successfully tested a new "electric furnace gas oxygen-assisted melting" technology for electric furnace steelmaking. The adoption of this new technology can increase the production level of electric furnaces by more than 17%. This is an important technological innovation for increasing the production of high-quality steel. Recently, they used this method to continuously smelt nineteen heats of steel, each heat weighing fourteen tons. The average smelting time for each heat of steel was reduced from 248 minutes to 211 minutes.

This initiative has attracted the attention of scientific research departments. In February of this year, the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology sent scientific research personnel to the steel plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company to jointly form an experimental research group and conduct planned experimental research. With the participation of veteran workers such as Li Shuhua and Xu Shaozhi, the equipment for blowing gas was improved. Scientific research personnel and workers together found a more reasonable set of operating methods. After several months of experiments, the melting time for each heat of steel was shortened from 142 minutes to 118 minutes.

This newspaper reports: Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and with the strong support of teachers and students from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, the Jingxi Mining Bureau, and the Chengzi Mine, the Beijing Special Steel Plant has successfully conducted experiments on melting iron in ironmaking furnaces using hot-made smokeless coal. This provides favorable conditions for increasing steel production and quality, reducing costs, and saving coal.

In the process of experimentation, the workers overcame many difficulties and finally discovered that hot-made smokeless coal has the advantages of high calorific value, low reactivity, high carbon content, low sulfur and ash content, and low volatile matter. This strengthened their determination to carry out the experiment to the end.

After six tests, it has been proven that using hot-made smokeless coal for ironmaking has many advantages. For example, in the past, when using coke, the iron temperature could only reach 1200-1250 degrees Celsius. With hot-made smokeless coal, it can reach 1280-1330 degrees Celsius, and with further efforts, it can even reach above 1400 degrees Celsius. When ironmaking furnaces use local coke, the tuyeres are easily blocked, which reduces the amount of air entering the furnace and lowers the iron temperature, thus prolonging the melting time. However, when using hot-made smokeless coal for ironmaking, the tuyeres remain mostly bright from the start of the furnace to its shutdown, ensuring normal air supply and accelerating the melting of iron. 3.2 tons more iron can be melted per hour. Two furnaces can produce an additional 76.8 tons of iron per day. In addition, because the ash content of hot-made smokeless coal is lower than that of the currently used coke, the amount of slag is reduced, saving transportation capacity.

### 发扬大胆创造精神  本溪钢铁公司创造电炉炼钢新技术生产水平提高百分之十七  北京特殊钢厂用热制无烟煤化铁每小时可以多化铁水三吨多

    发扬大胆创造精神
    本溪钢铁公司创造电炉炼钢新技术生产水平提高百分之十七
    北京特殊钢厂用热制无烟煤化铁每小时可以多化铁水三吨多
    据新华社沈阳4日电　本溪钢铁公司钢厂同中国科学院金属研究所协作试验成功一种“电炉煤气氧气助熔”的电炉炼钢新技术。采用这项新技术，可以使电炉生产水平提高17％以上。这是增产优质钢的一项重要技术创造。最近他们用这个方法连续冶炼了十九炉钢，每炉十四吨。平均每炉钢的冶炼时间从二百四十八分钟缩短到二百一十一分钟。
    这一创举引起科学研究部门的重视，中国科学院金属研究所和北京钢铁学院，在今年2月间派出科学研究人员到本溪钢铁公司钢厂，共同组成试验研究小组，有计划地进行试验研究。在李树华、许绍志等老工人的参加下，改进了吹煤气的设备；科学研究人员和工人一起，寻找出一套比较合理的操作方法，经过几个月的试验，将每炉钢的熔化时间从一百四十二分钟缩短到一百一十八分钟。
    本报讯　北京特殊钢厂在中共北京市委的领导下，经过北京钢铁学院师生、京西矿务局和城子矿的大力支持，进行用热制无烟煤在化铁炉中熔化铁水的试验现在已经成功。它给提高钢的产量、质量，降低成本，节省煤炭，提供了有利的条件。
    在试验过程中，职工们克服了很多困难，终于发现热制无烟煤具有发热值高，反应能力低，含炭量高，硫量和灰分低，挥发分少等优点，这就使他们坚定了试验到底的决心。
    经过六次试验证明：用热制无烟煤化铁有很多好处。如过去用焦炭时铁水温度仅能达到一千二百—一千二百五十度，用热制无烟煤，可以达到一千二百八十—一千三百三十度，如果经过努力还可以达到一千四百度以上。化铁炉用土焦易于堵风眼，这就使得风量入炉少，铁水温度低，熔化的时间就要延长；而用热制无烟煤化铁从开炉到停炉，风眼基本全是亮的，保证了正常送风，加速了铁水的熔化，每小时可多化三点二吨铁水，二个炉子每天就可以多出七十六点八吨铁水。另外，由于热制无烟煤的灰分比现用焦炭灰分低，就减少了渣量，节约了运力。
