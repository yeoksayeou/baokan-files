  Soviet Union Convenes All-Union Philosophical Coordination Conference
  Discusses Future Tasks of Philosophical Workers

  According to the Soviet magazine "Problems of Philosophy," the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences recently convened an All-Union Conference on Philosophical Issues to study the tasks of philosophical workers following the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. P.N. Fedoseev, Director of the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, delivered a report at the meeting, stating that several important theoretical issues have been further developed in the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and in Comrade Khrushchev's report. These include the two phases of communist society, the laws of transition from socialism to communism, the development prospects of the world socialist system, the socio-political organization during the period of large-scale communist construction, and the leading and organizational role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the struggle of the Soviet people for the victory of communism. The tasks set by the Congress for Soviet philosophical workers are to creatively summarize the experience of communist construction, boldly solve new theoretical problems, deeply study the laws of transition from socialism to communism, and specifically analyze the problems currently occurring in the capitalist world.

  In his report, Fedoseev discussed the dialectical development from socialism to communism. He cited, as an example, the relationship between the elimination of differences between the two forms of ownership and the establishment of the unified material and technical foundation of communism as such a dialectical relationship. The establishment of the unified material and technical foundation of communism requires the elimination of differences between the two forms of ownership, and the elimination of differences between the two forms of ownership is only possible with the establishment of the communist material and technical foundation. When talking about the role of socialist countries, Fedoseev said that during the period of large-scale communist construction, the functions of the state are also changing. Certain functions previously performed by the state are now gradually being taken over by social organizations. This means that in the transition to communism, the role of the socialist state will gradually transform into communist social self-governance. However, this does not mean a weakening of the role of the socialist state. On the contrary, the role of the Soviet state will increase with the construction of communism. Fedoseev also mentioned the issue of socialist countries entering communism at approximately the same time.

  During the discussion of the tasks for the next seven years, the conference participants summarized past achievements and shortcomings. Everyone agreed that the shortcomings of dispersed efforts and an excessive number of research topics must be overcome in future work. It is necessary to further strengthen the connection with the practice of Soviet communist construction and creatively solve the theoretical problems that arise in real life.

  Many speakers agreed that in future work, the study of the laws of transition from socialism to communism should be deepened. Research on the construction experience of various socialist countries and the awakening of oppressed nations in the East should be strengthened. Further expose the various fallacies of bourgeois philosophers who defend capitalism and the statements of modern revisionists.

  　苏联召开全苏哲学协作会议
    讨论哲学工作者的今后任务
    据苏联“哲学问题”杂志报导：苏联科学院哲学研究所不久前召开了全苏哲学问题协作会议，研究了苏共二十一次代表大会后哲学工作者的任务问题。苏联科学院哲学研究所所长费多塞也夫在会上作了报告，他说在苏共第二十一次党代表大会的决议里和赫鲁晓夫同志的报告里一些重要的理论问题都获得了进一步的发展。例如，共产主义社会的两个阶段问题，由社会主义向共产主义过渡的规律问题，世界社会主义体系的发展前景问题，在大规模共产主义建设时期的社会政治组织问题，以及苏联共产党在苏联人民争取共产主义胜利的斗争中的领导作用和组织作用等问题。代表大会向苏联哲学工作者提出的任务是：创造性地总结共产主义建设经验，勇敢地解决理论性的新问题，深入地研究由社会主义向共产主义过渡的规律，具体地分析目前资本主义世界发生的问题。
    费多塞也夫在报告中谈到了由社会主义向共产主义辩证发展的问题。他举例说，两种所有制差别的消灭和共产主义统一的物质技术基础的建立之间，便是这种辩证的发展关系；共产主义统一的物质技术基础的建立，要求消灭两种所有制的差别，而两种所有制差别的消灭，只有在共产主义物质技术基础建立时才有可能。在谈到社会主义国家作用时，费多塞也夫说，在大规模共产主义建设时期，国家的职能也在变化，以前某些由国家执行的职能，现在逐渐由社会组织所代行，这也就是说在向共产主义过渡时社会主义国家作用，将逐渐变成共产主义的社会自治。但这绝不表示社会主义国家作用的减弱。相反，苏维埃国家的作用，将随着共产主义的建设而增强。费多塞也夫还谈到了各社会主义国家大约同时进入共产主义的问题。
    会议的参加者在讨论今后七年的任务时，总结了过去的成绩与缺点。大家认为今后必需克服力量分散、研究题目过多的缺点，进一步加强与苏联共产主义建设实际的联系，创造性地解决生活实际中发生的理论问题。
    许多发言人都同意应在今后工作中深入研究由社会主义向共产主义过渡的规律问题。加强研究各社会主义国家建设经验，东方各被压迫民族的觉醒等问题。进一步揭穿资产阶级哲学家为资本主义辩护的各种谬论和现代修正主义者的言论。
