Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th: TASS, Washington, 28th -- U.S. President Eisenhower held a press conference on the 28th. He answered some questions about the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers’ visit to the United States at the conference.

Eisenhower said that he believed Khrushchev's visit to the United States laid the foundation for improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The U.S. President believes that, due to the visit of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev, the American people can better understand the problems existing in the relations between the two countries.

Eisenhower continued that the exchange of views at Camp David eliminated many U.S. objections to holding a high-level meeting. However, he also said that the issue of holding such a meeting should be discussed within the U.S. government and with U.S. allies. When Eisenhower spoke of the Berlin issue, he said that he and the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers discussed this issue, and although they were not engaged in specific negotiations, they reached an agreement on resuming discussions on the Berlin issue. He believes everyone agrees that the current situation in Berlin is abnormal. He emphasized that the only way to eliminate this situation is to hold negotiations that will take some time.

Eisenhower added that no timeframe was set for negotiations on the Berlin issue during the exchange of views with the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

Eisenhower said that neither he nor the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers could discuss the details related to disarmament. The U.S. President also said that during the exchange of views on disarmament, Khrushchev expressed the hope that Western countries should study the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations.

In response to why he delayed his visit to the Soviet Union until the spring, Eisenhower said that both he and Khrushchev would be very busy recently, and that visits to some areas in the Soviet Union would be difficult in the autumn and winter. He also mentioned that his grandchildren were willing to visit at that time. Eisenhower pointed out that he and Khrushchev had reached an agreement on postponing the visit.

According to Eisenhower, the American people unanimously believe that Khrushchev is an outstanding person. When talking about trade issues, he mentioned in general terms that both sides expressed the hope to develop trade, and the Soviet side expressed its willingness to discuss the issue of goods provided by the United States to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act during World War II.

At the beginning of the press conference, Eisenhower read a prepared statement on the steel industry strike. The statement said that the continued delay of the strike and the lack of agreement between representatives of labor and management had created a "stalemate," and he was prepared to use all his influence to break this "stalemate."

    在记者招待会上
    艾森豪威尔谈赫鲁晓夫访美
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿28日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔28日举行了记者招待会。他在招待会上回答了有关苏联部长会议主席访问美国的一些问题。
    艾森豪威尔说，他认为，赫鲁晓夫的访问美国，为改善美苏两国关系的过程打下了基础。美国总统认为，由于苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的访问，美国人民能够更好地了解两国关系中存在的问题。
    艾森豪威尔接着说，在戴维营交换意见的过程中，消除了美国方面对举行高级会议的许多反对意见。可是，他又说，关于举行这种会议的问题应当在美国政府中以及同美国的盟国进行讨论。艾森豪威尔在谈到柏林问题时说，他同苏联部长会议主席讨论了这个问题，虽然他们不是从事具体的谈判，但是，达成了关于恢复讨论柏林问题的协议。他认为，大家都同意，柏林现在的情况是不正常的。他强调指出，消除这种情况的唯一途径就是举行需要一段时间的谈判。
    艾森豪威尔又说，在同苏联部长会议主席交换意见的过程中，没有确定就柏林问题举行谈判的时限。
    艾森豪威尔说，他和苏联部长会议主席都不能够讨论同裁军问题有关的细节。美国总统还说，在就裁军问题交换意见的过程中，赫鲁晓夫表示希望西方国家应该研究苏联在联合国提出的普遍和彻底的裁军计划。
    艾森豪威尔在回答他为什么把访问苏联的时间延迟到春天的问题时说，他和赫鲁晓夫最近都将很忙，而且秋天和冬天访问苏联会对到某些地区的旅行造成困难。他还提到他的孙儿们愿意在那个时候访问。艾森豪威尔指出，他同赫鲁晓夫已经达成了关于缓期访问的协议。
    据艾森豪威尔说，美国人民一致认为赫鲁晓夫是一个杰出的人。他在谈到贸易问题时泛泛地提到，双方表示希望发展贸易，苏联方面表示愿意讨论美国在第二次世界大战期间按照租借法案向苏联提供的货物的问题。
    在记者招待会开始的时候，艾森豪威尔宣读了事先准备好的关于钢铁工业罢工的声明。声明说，罢工的继续拖延和劳资双方代表之间没有达成协议的情况已经造成了“僵局”，他准备利用他的一切影响来打破这种“僵局”。
