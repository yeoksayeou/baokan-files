A Zhuang village built against the mountains has several towering ancient pine trees, and a new shed has been built under the pine trees. From morning to night, the clatter of looms and melodious songs constantly echo from this shed. It turns out that the most beautiful work is being carried out here - a group of Zhuang women are weaving a wide and magnificent Zhuang brocade on several brocade looms, to present it to the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country on National Day.

We stand in front of such an unusual Zhuang brocade, listening to the Zhuang girls singing song after song:

	Eternal pines and cypresses, green and green,
	All ethnic people are of one heart.
	When drinking water, do not forget the well-digger,
	Weave Zhuang brocade to welcome National Day.

	Weave Zhuang brocade to welcome National Day,
	Every thread expresses true feelings,
	Weave out the good life of the Zhuang people,
	Weave out a heart of the Zhuang people.

This song reminds us of a Zhuang folk tale.

Once upon a time, there was a Zhuang mother named Dabu, who was a skilled Zhuang brocade weaver. Although she weaved brocade day and night, pouring her heart and soul into it, and breaking her back, she still suffered from hunger and cold. She often fantasized while weaving brocade, wondering when she could live a happy life where everyone was equal, and when the poor could have enough food and clothing! She weaved her fantasies into the Zhuang brocade. Weaving and weaving! After many long years, after using up the silk thread and cutting off her silver hair, and shedding her tears and dripping red blood, she finally wove a wonderful Zhuang brocade with the help of her son and neighbors. Here there is brilliant sunshine, golden fields, countless cattle and sheep, mountains of grain, tall and spacious houses...

Mother Dabu's beautiful wishes have finally become a reality today!

We visited the Zhuang girls who were weaving the brocade. Here are elderly grandmothers wrapped in batik headscarves, young mothers with their hair coiled on top of their heads and wearing aprons, and innocent and lively girls. They surround this gorgeous and colorful Zhuang brocade with such deep affection, skillfully and carefully weaving, weaving.

They told us: Zhuang brocade is a traditional handicraft of the Zhuang people, and it is their most beloved and precious gift. When young men and women are engaged, it is the matchmaker; at the time of marriage, it is a symbol of growing old together; and when a child is born, it is used to wrap him up.

In order to weave this Zhuang brocade, the surrounding Zhuang villages held a Zhuang brocade exhibition, selected the most outstanding brocade weavers, picked out the most beautiful traditional patterns, and created more than ten new designs. They also made more than ten kinds of silk threads of different colors.

You see, isn't the emerald green background in the Zhuang brocade our motherland? Isn't it the endless fields, dense forests, verdant mountains, and clear rivers? Isn't it a symbol of our motherland with infinite vitality?

You see, aren't the bright red patterns in the Zhuang brocade the dazzling sunshine? Aren't they the red flags waving in the wind, guiding us to advance to victory? Isn't it the fiery red heart of every Zhuang people?

You see, aren't the golden yellow patterns in the Zhuang brocade the abundant harvest of crops, the auspicious omen of a good year, and the clarion call of the Great Leap Forward? Isn't it our golden days?

    织幅僮锦迎国庆
    周民震　毛正三
    一个依山叠砌的僮族人民的村子，有几棵参天的古松，松树下新搭了一个草棚。从早到晚，这座草棚里不断地响着咔咔的织机声，不断地飘出动听的歌声。原来，这里正在进行一件最美最美的工作——一群僮族妇女在几架织锦机上合织着一幅宽大瑰丽的僮锦，要在国庆节时把它献给伟大的建国十周年纪念日。
    我们站在这样一幅不平常的僮锦面前，聆听着僮女们一曲又一曲的歌：
    万古松柏青又青，
    各族人民心连心。
    饮水不忘挖井人，
    织幅僮锦迎国庆。
    织幅僮锦迎国庆，
    丝丝线线表真情，
    织出僮家生活好，
    织出僮家一片心。
    这歌曲使我们想起了一个僮族的民间传说。
    从前，有一个僮族妈妈叫妲布，她是一个织僮锦的能手。尽管她日夜织锦，呕尽心血，折断腰干，仍然受着饥寒的折磨。她常常一边织锦一边幻想，什么时候能过人人平等的幸福日子，什么时候能让穷人丰衣足食！她把自己的幻想织在僮锦里。织啊织啊！度过了漫长的年月，用完了丝线割银发，流干了眼泪滴红血，终于在她的儿子和邻居们的帮助下织成了一幅美妙的僮锦。这里有灿烂的阳光，有金黄的田野，有数不尽的牛羊，有堆积如山的粮食，有高大宽敞的房屋……。
    妲布妈妈的美好的愿望，今天终于变成事实了！
    我们访问了织锦的僮女们。这里有裹着腊染头巾的年迈婆婆，有长发盘顶身穿围裙的年轻妈妈，还有天真活泼的姑娘。她们是那样深情地围着这幅绚烂妍丽的僮锦，巧手精心地在织着，织着。
    她们对我们说：僮锦是僮族人民传统的工艺品，是他们最心爱最珍贵的礼品。青年男女们定情的时候，它是媒人，在结婚时它是白头偕老的象征，而生下了孩子，又用它把他裹起来。
    为了织这幅僮锦，周围的僮族人民的村子举办了一个僮锦展览会，选拔了最优秀的织锦能手，挑出了最美的传统图样，创造了十多种最新的花色。还制出了十多种不同色彩的丝线。
    你看，那僮锦里翠绿翠绿的底色不正是我们祖国的大地吗？不正是极目无际的田园、浓密的森林、苍翠的山岭和碧澄的河川吗？不正是具有无限生命力的祖国的象征吗？
    你看，那僮锦里鲜红鲜红的花纹不正是耀眼夺目的阳光吗？不正是迎风飞舞引导我们向胜利进军的红旗吗？不正是每一个僮族人民火热的赤心吗？
    你看，那僮锦里金黄金黄的图案不正是收获的丰盛的庄稼，不正是丰年的喜兆和跃进的号音吗？不正是我们黄金般的日子吗？
