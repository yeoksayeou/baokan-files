Dear Comrades!

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Lebanese Communist Party and all communists, democrats, and progressives in our country, dear comrades! At this moment of celebrating the victory of the Chinese revolution and the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, cherished by every communist, patriot, and progressive in the world, I extend to you and the great Chinese people warm and heartfelt congratulations.

The workers, farmers, and advanced intellectuals of our country deeply understand that the victory of the Chinese revolution is the most significant historical event in modern times after the glorious October Revolution.

Our people know that this revolution, which liberated the largest country in Asia and led one of the oldest cultures on earth onto the path of building socialism, dealt a fatal blow to the international imperialist system and contributed to the disintegration of this system, thereby accelerating its inevitable demise.

The great Chinese revolution has contributed greatly to the development of the national liberation struggle of the people of Asia and Africa, especially the people of the Arab East. The Lebanese people, who took up arms against the Eisenhower Doctrine and imperialist military alliances, remember with deep gratitude the firm stance taken by the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries in support of our just cause during the US military occupation of the Lebanese coast. This stance played a decisive role in prompting the withdrawal of US troops from our country.

In addition to the support of the Soviet Union, People's China, and the entire socialist camp, one of the important factors in our victory and the victory of the national liberation movement in our Arab East is the unity of the peoples of the Arab countries and the establishment of a broad national front including all anti-imperialist patriotic forces within the country. The Iraqi revolution, which gave birth to the Republic of Iraq, greatly strengthened the position of the national liberation movement against imperialism and for liberation, democracy, and peace.

However, the policies of the United Arab Republic have gone astray. In the process of the merger of Egypt and Syria, a large number of capitalists, monopolists, and Egyptian banks revealed their ambition to control and expand to other Arab countries. This ambition has already been manifested in conspiracies against the Republic of Iraq and policies of exerting pressure on Lebanon. All of this has weakened Arab unity and divided the national fronts within Arab countries.

The United Arab Republic is today pursuing a policy of colluding with Arab reactionary forces, compromising with imperialism, allowing imperialist capital to infiltrate, and pursuing anti-communist and anti-democratic movements within Arab countries. A reign of terror is being implemented in Egypt and Syria, persecuting communists and loyal democrats. Secret agents kidnapped Comrade Helou, Secretary of the Central Committee of our Communist Party, on the streets of Damascus and subjected him to various tortures. His whereabouts are still unknown today.

The rulers of the UAR are trying to pull Lebanon into this policy, but the Lebanese people will continue to struggle against all the conspiracies of the US imperialists to drag Lebanon into this policy and control the Lebanese economy. At the same time, they will fight alongside the peoples of the Arab countries against this reactionary tendency, which is in line with the policy of imperialism in the Arab East.

The Lebanese people are delighted with the great victories achieved by the great Chinese people in building socialism under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party. They join the people of all countries in shouting their support for the Chinese people's struggle to achieve the reunification of their motherland, to return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland, and to win the legitimate status of People's China in the United Nations. Because the Lebanese people believe that this is a great support for themselves and for the people of all countries struggling for liberation, democracy, and peace.

Our people believe that the Chinese people will defeat all provocations created by US imperialism and reactionaries, just as they did in Tibet and in the Sino-Indian border incident.

We believe that the glorious Chinese Communist Party, headed by the beloved Comrade Mao Zedong, and its Marxist-Leninist Central Committee will lead you from victory to victory in the struggle for socialist construction. Your victory is the victory of the entire socialist camp, and the victory of all the peoples of all countries who are struggling for national liberation, democracy and peace.

Long live the great Chinese people struggling to build socialism!

Long live the People's Republic of China, one of the strongholds in the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and its Marxist-Leninist Central Committee!

### 黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会书记处书记、黎巴嫩共产党代表团团长  哈桑·科赖滕同志的贺词

    黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会书记处书记、黎巴嫩共产党代表团团长
    哈桑·科赖滕同志的贺词亲爱的同志们！
    我代表黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会和我国所有的共产党员、民主和进步人士，亲爱的同志们！在庆祝这个为世界每一个共产党人、每一个爱国者和进步人士所珍视的中国革命胜利和中华人民共和国建国十周年的时刻，向你们和伟大的中国人民致以热烈的、衷心的祝贺。
    我国的工人、农民、先进知识分子深深懂得继光荣的十月革命以后在现代发生的最重大的历史事件就是中国革命的胜利。
    我国人民知道，解放了亚洲最大一个国家，把地球上文化最古老的一个民族带上建设社会主义道路的这一革命，给予国际帝国主义体系一次致命的打击，对于瓦解这一体系，从而加速它的必然的灭亡作出了贡献。
    伟大的中国革命对亚非人民尤其是阿拉伯东方人民民族解放斗争的巨大发展作出了贡献，拿起武器反对艾森豪威尔主义和帝国主义军事同盟的黎巴嫩人民，以十分感激的心情牢记着苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家在美军占领黎巴嫩海岸时对我们的正义事业所采取的坚决立场，这一立场对于促使美国军队撤出我国方面起了决定性的作用。
    除了苏联、人民中国和整个社会主义阵营的支持外，我们的胜利和我们阿拉伯东方民族解放运动的胜利的重要因素之一就是阿拉伯各国人民的团结和广泛的包括国内一切反帝爱国力量的民族阵线的建立。诞生了伊拉克共和国的伊拉克革命，大大地加强了反对帝国主义和争取解放、民主、和平的民族解放运动的阵地。
    但是，阿拉伯联合共和国的政策走上了歧途，在埃及和叙利亚合并过程中，一大批资本家、垄断资本家和埃及银行暴露出企图进行控制和向其他阿拉伯国家进行扩张的野心，这种野心已经表现在对伊拉克共和国进行阴谋和对黎巴嫩实行施加压力的政策方面。所有这一切都削弱了阿拉伯团结，分裂了阿拉伯各国内部的民族阵线。
    阿拉伯联合共和国今天正奉行着纠结阿拉伯反动势力，同帝国主义妥协，使帝国主义资本渗入的政策，奉行着反共反阿拉伯国家内部的民主运动的政策。在埃及和叙利亚实行恐怖统治，迫害共产党人和忠诚的民主人士，特务分子在大马士革大街上劫走我国共产党中央委员会书记赫卢同志，并施以各种酷刑，直到今天，还不知下落。
    阿联的统治者企图把黎巴嫩拉到这个政策方面来，但黎巴嫩人民将继续进行斗争，反对美帝国主义者把黎巴嫩拖向这个政策、控制黎巴嫩经济的一切阴谋，同时将和阿拉伯各国人民一道，为反对同帝国主义在阿拉伯东方的政策相吻合的这种反动倾向进行斗争。
    黎巴嫩人民为在光荣的中国共产党领导下的伟大的中国人民在建设社会主义方面所取得的巨大胜利感到欢欣鼓舞。他们和世界各国人民齐声高呼，支持中国人民为实现祖国统一，为使台湾回到祖国怀抱以及为争取人民中国在联合国中取得合法地位所进行的斗争。因为黎巴嫩人民认为这对于他们自己，对于为争取解放、民主和和平而斗争的各国人民都是巨大的支持。
    我国人民相信，中国人民将击败美帝国主义和反动派所制造的一切挑衅，就像在西藏和在中印边界事件那样。
    我们相信以敬爱的毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党及其马克思列宁主义的中央委员会，将领导你们在为社会主义建设的斗争中由胜利走向胜利。你们的胜利是整个社会主义阵营的胜利，是一切为争取民族解放、民主与和平而斗争的各国人民的胜利。
    为建设社会主义而斗争的伟大的中国人民万岁！
    以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营中的坚强堡垒之一中华人民共和国万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党及其马克思列宁主义的中央委员会万岁！（附图片）
