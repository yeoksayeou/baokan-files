Miyun's Sea
〔Albanian〕Alek Çaçi

What I saw in Miyun! Countless people gathered, fiercely warring against nature. The river was once a source of suffering, but today it has moved its home. My heart is so stirred I can hardly speak; I can only watch with my eyes. I look, I look, greedily taking in everything around me. Why is there such a great change here? People clench their fists and resolutely say: From now on, we will forever break away from poverty... In Miyun, a new sea has appeared, from now on, light will shine in all directions, the earth will no longer suffer from thirst, everywhere will be full of hope, only hope... My imagination flies out of the boat, as if I am strolling on the calm water, a light mist floats in the distance, life is so beautiful! Just as I was stepping lightly on the water, I saw, on the other side, Chang'e, who descended from the moon last night, the breeze blowing her soft hair, softly singing. Will Chang'e return to her original home? I think she will stay here for the rest of her life. And I will be the same as her, and the people who came with me will definitely not want to leave this place. In Miyun, I imagine the future, a future full of flowers whether it is summer or winter. One flower blooms first, followed by a hundred flowers blooming together. From Albania, many news also came, here, there, flowers are blooming everywhere. Everywhere is planting flowers! I said to myself: You plant flowers too! Because I like the fragrance of flowers, because I am also fighting to overcome poverty.

    密云的海
    〔阿尔巴尼亚〕阿列克斯·恰奇在密云我看到了什么！聚集着数不尽的人，愤怒地向大自然开战。从前河水是苦难的源泉，今天它已经把家迁。我的内心激动得几乎讲不出话来，只有用两眼观看。我看着，看着，贪婪地看着周围的一切。为什么这里会有这样大的变化？人们握紧拳头，坚决地说道：从此，我们永远与穷困决裂……在密云出现了新的海洋，从此，光明将普照这里的四方，大地不再遭受饥渴，到处充满希望，只有希望……我的想像飞出了小船，好像我漫步在平静的水面，轻雾飘拂在远方，生活是多么美满！正当我轻步水面，我看到，在那一边，昨夜从月中降下的嫦娥，微风吹动她的柔发，在轻声地歌唱。嫦娥还会回到原来的家乡么？我想，她将终生留在这里。而我也要和她一样，和我同来的人们，也一定不愿离开这块地方。在密云，我想像着未来，不管是夏天还是冬天都充满花朵的未来。一花先开，紧接着是百花齐放。从阿尔巴尼亚，也传来了许多消息，这里，那里，处处开满花朵。处处都在栽花！我对自己说道：你也栽花吧！因为，我喜欢花的芬芳，因为，我也为战胜贫困而斗争。
