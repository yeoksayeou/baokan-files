Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 6th – On the eve of the 15th anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation (September 9th), good news of production achievements in the labor emulation launched to celebrate the festival is coming from all corners of the country. Recently, Bulgarian newspapers have been publishing large amounts of workers' announcements of success every day.

Many enterprises have completed their September production plans ahead of schedule. Workers at the "Volcano" Cement United Factory in Dimitrovgrad completed their September plan twenty-six days ahead of schedule due to large-scale socialist emulation. They overproduced 9,700 tons of cement and 151,000 meters of asbestos cement pipes, saved 2,377,700 leva beyond the plan, and completed the five-year plan for reducing production costs. Mining workers in Kremikovtsi, workers in the advanced machine manufacturing plant in Popovo, miners in the Spoluka coal mine near Madana, etc., have all completed their September plans ahead of schedule.

Outstanding labor achievements have emerged one after another in the competition to greet National Day. For example, in Dimitrovgrad, miners in the sixth section of the Galvanov mine completed this year's production plan 140 days ahead of schedule on August 10th and reduced coal mining costs by 176,000 leva. They have now started mining coal according to the 1960 plan. Dockworkers in Burgas on the Black Sea completed their September plan 52 days ahead of schedule and guaranteed to complete this year's plan a month and a half ahead of schedule. In the first six months of this year alone, Burgas dockworkers saved 1,348,800 leva more than originally planned, and they also guarantee to save a total of 2 million leva beyond the plan by the end of the year.

Agricultural workers are also welcoming National Day with various practical actions. At present, fourteen states across the country have completed the task of selling wheat to the state, and seven of them have also completed the task of selling rice, barley, and oats. The agricultural production cooperative in Haskovo has completed the annual plan for silage feed ahead of schedule, storing 12,200 tons of feed. The Nova Zagora machine tractor station has completed the annual plan ahead of schedule on all indicators.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 6th – According to reports in the local press: Bulgaria's electricity industry, which was very backward before liberation, has developed rapidly during the era of the people's government. At present, in terms of per capita electricity production, Bulgaria ranks first in the Balkan Peninsula and will leap to the forefront of European countries in the next few years.

According to the national economic development plan, Bulgaria's electricity production this year will reach 3.726 billion kilowatt-hours, which is 13 times more than in 1939.

Since liberation, Bulgaria has carried out large-scale construction of hydroelectric power stations, thermal power stations, and diesel power stations, and its electricity industry has been advancing at a faster rate than the development of the entire industry. In 1958, the entire industrial production increased by about eight times compared to 1939, while during the same period, electricity production increased by more than ten times.

In almost half a century up to 1939, Bulgarian capitalists only built power stations with a total power generation capacity of 111,000 kilowatts, producing about 266 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. The people's government, in the short fourteen years up to last year, built power stations with a total power generation capacity of 672,000 kilowatts, bringing last year's electricity production to more than 3 billion kilowatt-hours. The new power generation capacity added by Bulgaria in just one year last year exceeded the power generation capacity built by old Bulgaria in half a century.

With the rapid increase in electricity production, Bulgaria's power grid is also constantly expanding. In 1948, there were a total of 8,750 kilometers of transmission lines with a voltage of over 15,000 volts, which increased to 20,875 kilometers by 1958, an increase of more than double. In this way, Bulgaria has basically established a unified national high-voltage transmission line system, which makes it possible to more rationally distribute electricity across the country and ensure electricity supply to various regions.

Bulgaria's electricity industry has broad development prospects. Investigation materials show that the country's water resources alone are sufficient to build hydroelectric power stations with a total power generation capacity of more than 2.7 million kilowatts, which can produce about 9 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. The abundant deposits of low-quality coal discovered throughout the country, especially in the East Maritsa coal mining area, provide a solid resource for the development of electricity production.

According to Bulgaria's plan for developing the national economy, electricity production will reach 6 to 7 billion kilowatt-hours in 1962 and 10 to 12 billion kilowatt-hours in 1965. During this period, a series of thermal power stations and hydroelectric power stations will be put into production. The new and powerful thermal power stations will play a major role in completing the above tasks, among which the "Maritsa East" thermal power grid, which is under construction, will supply most of the electricity needed by the country.

### 开展劳动竞赛　迎接国庆十五周年  保加利亚生产战线喜报频传  电力产量按人口平均居巴尔干半岛首位

    开展劳动竞赛　迎接国庆十五周年
    保加利亚生产战线喜报频传
    电力产量按人口平均居巴尔干半岛首位
    新华社索非亚6日电　在保加利亚解放十五周年（9月9日）前夕，全国各个角落纷纷传来在为迎接节日而展开的劳动竞赛中取得的生产成就的喜讯。近日来，保加利亚的报纸每天都以大量篇幅刊登劳动人民的喜报。
    许多企业已经提前完成了9月份的生产计划。季米特洛夫格勒的“火山”水泥联合工厂的工人由于大规模地展开社会主义竞赛，提前二十六天完成了9月份的计划。他们超计划生产了九千七百吨水泥和十五万一千米的石棉水泥管，超计划节约了二百三十七万七千列弗，并且完成了降低生产成本的五年计划。克列米科维茨的采矿工人、波波夫市的先进的机器制造厂工人、马达纳市附近的斯波卢卡煤矿的矿工等等，都提前完成了9月份的计划。
    在为迎接国庆而开展的竞赛中，突出的劳动业绩层出不穷。例如，在季米特洛夫城，加尔瓦诺夫矿井的第六工段的矿工们，在8月10日就提前一百四十天完成了今年的生产计划，并且使采煤成本降低了十七万六千列弗。他们现在已经开始按1960年的计划采煤。黑海的布加斯城的码头工人提前五十二天完成了9月份计划，并且保证要提前一个半月完成今年的计划。仅仅在今年头六个月，布加斯的码头工人就比原计划多节约了一百三十四万八千列弗，他们还保证在年底前总共超计划节约二百万列弗。
    农业劳动者也以各种实际行动来迎接国庆节。目前，全国已有十四个州完成了向国家交售小麦的任务，其中七个州还完成了交售大米、大麦和燕麦的任务。哈斯科夫城的农业生产合作社已经提前完成了青贮饲料的年度计划，贮存了一万二千二百吨饲料。诺瓦扎哥拉市的机器拖拉机站在各项指标上提前完成了年度计划。
    新华社索非亚6日电　据此间报刊报道：解放前十分落后的保加利亚的电力工业，在人民政权年代中获得了飞快的发展。目前，在按人口平均计算的电力产量方面，保加利亚居巴尔干半岛的首位，并且将在最近几年内跃居欧洲国家的前列地位。
    根据国民经济的发展计划，今年保加利亚的电力生产将达到三十七亿二千六百万度，即比1939年增长十三倍。
    解放以来，保加利亚进行了大规模的水力发电站、火力发电站和柴油发电站的建设工作，它的电力工业一直以比整个工业的发展更快的速度向前迈进。1958年，整个工业生产比1939年约增长了八倍，而同一时期，电力生产则增长了十倍多。
    在到1939年为止的几乎半个世纪中，保加利亚的资本家们仅仅建设了总发电能力为十一万一千瓩的发电站，每年生产约二亿六千六百万度电。而人民政权在到去年为止的短短十四年中就建设了总发电能力为六十七万二千瓩的发电站，使去年的电力产量达到了三十多亿度。保加利亚仅在去年一年新增加的发电能力，就超过了旧保加利亚在半个世纪中所建立的发电能力。
    随着电力产量的迅速增加，保加利亚的电力网也在不断扩大。在1948年，电压超过一万五千伏的输电线路共有八千七百五十公里长，而到1958年则增加到二万零八百七十五公里，即增加了一倍多。这样，保加利亚就基本上建立起了全国统一的高压输电线路系统，从而有可能更合理地在全国分配电力和保证对各地的电力供应。
    保加利亚的电力工业有着广阔的发展前途。调查材料表明，仅全国的水利资源就足够再建设总发电能力为二百七十多万瓩的水力发电站，每年可以再生产约九十亿度电力。在全国各地，特别是在东马里查煤矿区发现的丰富的劣质煤的矿藏，更为发展电力生产提供了雄厚的资源。
    根据保加利亚发展国民经济的计划，电力生产在1962年将达到六十到七十亿度，而到1965年将达到一百亿到一百二十亿度。在这期间，保加利亚将有一系列的火力发电站和水力发电站投入生产。而新的强大的火力发电站将在完成上述任务中起主要作用，其中，正在建设中的“马里查东部”火力发电网将供给国家所需电力的大部分。（附图片）
