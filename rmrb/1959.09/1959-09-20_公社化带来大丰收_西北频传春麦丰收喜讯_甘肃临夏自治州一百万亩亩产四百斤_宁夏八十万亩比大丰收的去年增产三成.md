Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 18th: The Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu has achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest of spring wheat. The prefecture's 1.03 million mu of spring wheat yielded 400 jin per mu, an increase of 23% compared to last year.
    The spring wheat harvest season in Gansu Province is relatively late. The spring wheat in the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture was only completely harvested by mid-September. Whether in mountainous areas, river valleys, dry land, or irrigated land, the entire prefecture achieved a universal bumper harvest, and many high-yielding fields emerged. Hezheng County, which had the largest increase in production, saw its 380,000 mu of spring wheat increase by more than 30% compared to last year's great harvest. The Dongxiang Autonomous County, a previously well-known low-yield area, saw a particularly significant increase in production. In the past, the most arid Longquan People's Commune and the damp Yinji People's Commune in this county would "harvest the valleys, but the mountains would be dry; harvest the mountains, but the valleys would be flooded." This year, however, the mountains and valleys were uniformly bounteous, with a comprehensive bumper harvest, and the average yield per mu increased by more than 50% compared to last year.
    This year, all communes have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture from beginning to end. Last winter and this spring, all communes launched mass movements, setting off a high tide of mass fertilizer accumulation and deep plowing. The average application of fertilizer per mu of wheat field in the prefecture reached about 100 dan. Rational close planting was universally promoted during sowing, and good spring wheat varieties such as "Yupí" and "774" were selected, and all were treated with pesticides. Due to early preparation and quick action, the prefecture overfulfilled its sowing plan by 5.23%.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, September 18th: The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of spring wheat this year. According to the results of threshing and verification by people's communes in various places over the past month, the average yield per mu of 809,000 mu of spring wheat in Wuzhong, Zhongning, Zhongwei and other twelve counties and cities on both sides of the Yellow River reached 410 jin, an increase of more than 30% compared to the great harvest of 1958. Among them, Wuzhong City had the highest yield, with an average yield of 499 jin per mu for more than 23,000 mu of spring wheat in the city.
    This year's large-scale bumper harvest of spring wheat on the Ningxia Plain fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes. Last autumn, as soon as the people's communes were established, Hui and Han members began a series of preparations for this year's bumper harvest. A large-scale deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation movement was launched throughout the region. Various places built relatively complete drainage networks in a very short period of time, lowering the groundwater level and improving the soil. During the wheat growing season this year, management was meticulous, and multiple natural disasters such as wind, sand, frost, hail, and pests were overcome. (Attached picture)
    Since liberation, in terms of fruit production, due to the strengthening of management and the cultivation and promotion of improved varieties, output has been greatly increased. The number of varieties is also constantly increasing. This is a bumper harvest of the famous Shandong Yantai "Red Banana" apples.

    公社化带来大丰收
    西北频传春麦丰收喜讯
    甘肃临夏自治州一百万亩亩产四百斤
    宁夏八十万亩比大丰收的去年增产三成
    据新华社兰州18日电　甘肃临夏回族自治州春小麦获得空前的大面积丰产。全州一百零三万亩春小麦亩产四百斤，比去年增加23％。
    甘肃省春小麦收获季节较晚，临夏回族自治州的春小麦到9月中旬才收割完毕。全州不论山地、川地、旱地、水地，普遍丰收，并且出现了许多高额丰产田。增产幅度最大的和政县，今年三十八万亩春小麦，比大丰收的去年增产三成以上。过去著名的低产区东乡族自治县，增产特别显著。这个县最干旱的龙泉人民公社和阴湿区的尹集人民公社，往年都是“收了川、旱了山，收了山，涝了川”；今年则是山川一色，全面丰收，每亩平均比去年增产了五成以上。
    今年各公社自始至终都认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”。去冬今春，各公社大搞群众运动，掀起全民积肥和深翻地高潮，全州平均每亩麦田施肥达到一百担左右；播种中普遍推行了合理密植，选用了“玉皮”、“七七四”等春小麦良种，而且都用药剂拌过。由于准备早，行动快，全州超额5.23％完成了播种计划。
    据新华社银川18日电　宁夏回族自治区今年春小麦空前大丰收。经各地人民公社最近一个月来打场核实的结果，黄河两岸十二个县市的吴忠、中宁、中卫等八十万零九千亩春小麦，平均每亩产量达到四百一十斤，比大丰收的1958年增长三成多。其中产量最高的是吴忠市，全市二万三千多亩春小麦，平均亩产四百九十九斤。
    今年宁夏平原上春小麦能够获得大面积丰产，充分证明了人民公社的无比优越性。去年秋天人民公社刚一建立，回族和汉族社员就为今年大丰收进行了一系列的准备工作。全区开展了大规模的深翻地和积肥运动。各地在很短时间内就建成了比较完整的排水网，降低了地下水位，改良了土壤。今年小麦生长期间，管理周到，并且战胜了多次风沙、霜冻、冰雹和病虫等自然灾害。（附图片）
    解放以来，在水果生产方面，由于加强了经营管理和良种的培育、推广，产量大大提高。品种也不断增多。这是著名的山东烟台“红香蕉”苹果又获丰收。
