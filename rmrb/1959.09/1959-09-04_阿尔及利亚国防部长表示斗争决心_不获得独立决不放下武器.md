Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 31st: Algerian Republic Provisional Government Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Belkacem Krim, told a reporter from the "Iraqi Times" in Tunis that "Algeria will remain an Arab nation, and it will persist in its struggle until it achieves complete independence." This speech was published today.

The Algerian Deputy Prime Minister vehemently condemned the atrocities committed by French imperialism. He said that the criminal French are massacring thousands of civilians in Algeria, burning farms, destroying homes, bombing cities with airplanes, torturing and killing prisoners, and tormenting women and children. Since the beginning of the struggle, more than 600,000 Algerian military personnel and civilians have been killed. More than 500,000 Algerian refugees have been displaced in Tunisia and Morocco. French authorities have detained more than one million Algerians, preventing them from joining the ranks of the Algerian fighters.

The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out, "It is precisely because the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has provided France with assistance in weapons, supplies, funds, and diplomacy that France has been able to maintain its war against the Algerian people."

He emphasized that, despite this, the determination of the Algerian people is now stronger than ever before. "The heroic Algerian army has been able to defeat the heaviest attacks launched by France against the Algerian Liberation Army. This happened a few weeks ago when the French army launched its largest offensive in order to eliminate the Algerian army. But the French offensive failed. I am confident that soon the Algerian army will be able to inflict a fatal blow on the French army.”

Belkacem Krim refuted the French claim that Algeria is part of the French mainland, and said that Algeria is an Arab nation and will always be an Arab nation. He hoped that at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, the Algerian cause would be victorious due to the assistance of Arab countries and the cooperation of Asian and African countries, socialist countries, and other peace-loving nations.

He said that the people of Arab countries sympathize with the Algerian issue. The people and governments of Arab countries are helping Algeria to continue its struggle until it defeats French imperialism. Socialist countries have provided some assistance to Algeria, and the People's Republic of China has donated a large amount of clothing and medicine to Algerian refugees.

The Deputy Prime Minister emphasized, "We will never lay down our weapons until we achieve complete independence."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 2nd: The Supreme Command of the Algerian National Liberation Army issued a military communiqué on the 1st, stating that in the four days from August 25th to 28th, the Algerian army killed 130 French officers and soldiers and wounded 51.

The communiqué said that during this period, the troops of the National Liberation Army attacked the Challe Line, which was built by the French military command to strengthen the ineffective Morice Line, and opened many gaps in this blockade line. Algerian soldiers engaged in battle with French troops after crossing the line. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than 50 French soldiers were killed.

In addition, some French troops participating in the so-called "Twin Operation" commanded personally by Challe, the French commander of the army in Algeria, were attacked by the National Liberation Army. The National Liberation Army killed 31 French soldiers and wounded 33.

The Algerian army and the French army engaged in encounters in the Touffana, Chevreul, and Miliana areas. The Algerian army carried out two ambushes against the enemy. Two French strongholds in the Kerrata area were surrounded and partially destroyed.

During this period, the Algerian army seized 34 weapons. (Attached picture)

    阿尔及利亚国防部长表示斗争决心
    不获得独立决不放下武器
    新华社巴格达31日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府副总理兼国防部长贝勒卡塞姆·克里姆在突尼斯对“伊拉克时报”记者说，“阿尔及利亚将仍然是阿拉伯国家，它将坚持斗争，直到获得完全独立为止。”这篇讲话今天已经发表。
    阿尔及利亚副总理激烈谴责法帝国主义所犯的暴行。他说，罪恶的法国正在阿尔及利亚屠杀成千的平民，烧焚农场，毁坏住房，用飞机轰炸城市，拷打和屠杀犯人以及折磨妇女和儿童。自从斗争开始以来，有六十多万阿尔及利亚军事人员和平民被杀害。被移置在突尼斯和摩洛哥的阿尔及利亚难民达五十多万。法国当局拘禁了一百多万阿尔及利亚人，不让他们参加阿尔及利亚战士的队伍。
    这位副总理指出，“正是由于北大西洋公约组织在武器、供应品、基金以及外交方面为法国提供了援助，因此法国才能够维持它反对阿尔及利亚人民的战争。”
    他强调指出，尽管如此，现在阿尔及利亚人民的决心比过去任何时候都更加坚强。“英雄的阿尔及利亚军队已经能够击败法国对阿尔及利亚解放军所策动的最沉重的攻击。那是几星期以前法国军队为了要消灭阿尔及利亚军队而发动规模最大的攻势时的事。但是法国的攻势失败了。我确信，不久阿尔及利亚军队将能够给予法国军队以致命的打击。
    贝勒卡塞姆·克里姆驳斥了法国所谓的阿尔及利亚是法国本土的一部分的说法，并且说，阿尔及利亚是一个阿拉伯国家，并且将永远是一个阿拉伯国家。他希望，在即将举行的联合国大会上，阿尔及利亚的事业将由于取得阿拉伯国家的帮助和亚非国家、社会主义国家及其它爱好和平的国家的合作而获得胜利。
    他说，阿拉伯各国人民同情阿尔及利亚问题。阿拉伯各国人民和政府帮助阿尔及利亚继续斗争，直到它战胜法帝国主义为止。社会主义国家已经为阿尔及利亚提供了一些援助，中华人民共和国已经捐助阿尔及利亚难民以大量的衣服和药品。
    这位副总理强调说，“不获得完全独立，我们决不放下武器”。
    新华社开罗2日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放军最高司令部1日发表军事公报说，在从8月25日到28日的四天中，阿尔及利亚军队打死一百三十名法军官兵，打伤五十一名。
    公报说，在这个期间，民族解放军的部队袭击了法军司令部为了加强无效的莫里斯防线而建立的夏耳防线，并在这个封锁线上打开了许多缺口。阿尔及利亚士兵在穿过防线后同法国军队交战。经过几小时的激烈战斗，有五十多名法国士兵被打死。
    此外，参加由法国在阿尔及利亚陆军司令夏耳亲自指挥的所谓“双胞胎行动”的一些法国部队，遭到民族解放军的攻击。民族解放军打死三十一名法军士兵，打伤三十三名。
    阿尔及利亚军队同法国军队在图法纳、歇夫勒尔和米利亚地区发生遭遇战。阿尔及利亚军队对敌军进行了两次伏击战。在克拉塔区的两个法国据点被包围并部分被摧毁。
    在这个期间，阿尔及利亚军队缴获了三十四件武器。（附图片）
