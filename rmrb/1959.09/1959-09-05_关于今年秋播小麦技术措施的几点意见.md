    Several Opinions on Technical Measures for Autumn Wheat Planting This Year
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute
    Editor's Note: The winter wheat sowing season is approaching, and all parts of the country are stepping up preparations for sowing. In order to strive for a greater bumper harvest of winter wheat next year, it is necessary to summarize this year's high-yield experience and improve this year's technical measures. The following article is an effort in this regard. It is based on the discussions of a winter wheat high-yield technology symposium recently held by the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Representatives from agricultural science research institutes (academies) in major winter wheat producing areas such as Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, as well as representatives from units such as Beijing Agricultural University and Nanjing Agricultural College, participated in this symposium. We believe this article is worth referencing.
    This year, winter wheat across the country once again achieved an overall bumper harvest. In high-yield practice and experimental research, many rich experiences have been created, a large amount of scientific data has been accumulated, and some important technical issues have been clarified. In order to strive for a greater leap forward in winter wheat production next year, we have combined the high-yield experience of Beijing, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu this year to put forward some preliminary opinions on several technical issues for autumn sowing of winter wheat for reference by various regions.
    I. Plow to a Depth of Six to Eight Inches, Combine Fertilization to Ripen the Soil; Fine Plow and Careful Harrowing, Level the Land
    The effect of deep plowing is definite. Its yield increase depends on the original thickness of the cultivated layer, the degree of deep plowing, the level of soil fertility and fertilization, soil type, the quality of cultivated land preparation, and specific conditions such as sun-curing, among which the amount and quality of fertilization have the greatest impact. Deep plowing in dryland areas has a more significant yield increase than in irrigated land because it improves soil moisture conditions. Loam alluvial soil is easier to manage in terms of cultivation quality, and deep plowing has a better effect than clay and paddy soil. Deep plowing in fallow land in single-cropping areas ripens the soil through sun-curing and improves fertility, and the effect of deep plowing is also very prominent.
    Many comparative materials from Hebei, Jiangsu, Hubei and other places show that within a certain range, the yield gradually increases as the depth of plowing increases. For example, in 22 counties, 46 points, and 160 depth comparisons in Hebei Province, when the cultivated layer was deepened from four to five inches to six to eight inches, the yield increased by 19.8%, and when it was deepened to about 1 foot, the yield increased by 30.5%. Further deepening still has a certain yield-increasing effect, but the yield increase gradually decreases, and it must be combined with a large amount of fertilization; when the depth of plowing exceeds two feet, the yield decreases due to easy disturbance of the soil layer, poor quality of cultivated land preparation, and insufficient fertilization.
    According to a large amount of observation data, regardless of whether the depth of plowing is from six to seven inches or even six to seven feet, the dense layer of roots is generally within the soil layer of zero to six to nine inches, and more than 85% of the roots are within the range of zero to one and a half feet. This is because the distribution of oxygen in the soil decreases with increasing depth, and root growth requires oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, the activity of aerobic soil microorganisms such as ammonifying bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, cellulose-decomposing bacteria, and silicate bacteria is inhibited, the nutrient conversion process is hindered, and the respiratory and metabolic functions of root tissues are destroyed. On the other hand, with the increase in the depth of cultivated land, the burden on labor and livestock and the wear and tear of machinery increase sharply. If the rice-wheat double-cropping fields in the south are plowed too deeply, it takes a lot of labor to level the fields when planting rice the following year, and it causes uneven ground and inconsistent rice seedling growth; at the same time, it is difficult to cultivate in excessively deep mud, work efficiency is low, and it is not conducive to high-yield rice cultivation.
    In view of this situation, especially considering the current limitations of labor, livestock power, and machinery performance, whether in the south or the north, the general depth of plowing for dryland should be six to eight inches, and about six inches for paddy fields is more appropriate; high-yield plots can be deeply plowed to about one foot if conditions permit.
    Deep plowing must be combined with increased fertilization and soil ripening in order to cultivate a deep and fertile soil layer in a short period of time.
    Deep plowing must adhere to not disturbing the soil layer, so as to avoid the mixing of raw soil into the surface layer, reducing the fertility of the surface soil, and affecting the quality of land preparation and sowing. This year, deep plowing comparison materials from Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Henan and other places have unanimously pointed out that after the soil layer is disturbed, the emergence rate is reduced, the plant growth is poor, and the yield is significantly reduced.
    Deep plowing must also adhere to fine cultivation, so as to achieve level ground, broken soil, and uniform mixing of soil and fertilizer, so as to ensure uniform and robust seedlings and lay the foundation for high yield. Some communes and teams last year only paid attention to deep plowing but not to cultivation, resulting in uneven ground and large clods all over the ground, which not only affected emergence but also hindered future field management, making it difficult to increase yield.
    Deep plowing and cultivation should have an overall perspective, seize the time, and line up according to the time of stubble. For single-cropping fallow land, deep fallow plowing should be carried out, the soil should be sun-cured more, and the soil moisture should be retained by harrowing in time; early-stubble land should also be deeply plowed in autumn as early as possible, and the soil should be sun-cured appropriately; late-stubble land should be plowed, cultivated, and sown immediately after harvesting. In order to rush the sowing season, the cultivated land can be plowed to about four to five inches. If labor, livestock, and machinery cannot keep up and deep plowing is forced, delaying the sowing season may result in labor being fruitless and outweighing the gains. In this case, more harrowing and careful harrowing should be carried out to break up the soil blocks to facilitate sowing and emergence. It must be pointed out that while rushing to sow is important, leveling the land is also very important. The two should be taken into account. Only on the basis of ensuring the quality of cultivation and sowing can rushing to sow have a yield-increasing effect.
    According to the experience of veteran farmers, on general soils, a single deep plowing of eight to ten inches or more can last for three to four years, with the second year being the best. Therefore, deep plowing should be carried out in rotation in a planned way, so that all land is deep plowed once every three to four years. Fields that have already been deep plowed last year can be cultivated and sown according to general cultivation standards this autumn without deep plowing.
    At the same time as deep plowing, work should be done well in leveling the land, repairing canals, making ridges, and building water conservancy projects, so as to effectively avoid wheat fields with ridges but no water, sitting idly by and suffering from drought and reduced production, or having water but no ridges, being uneven, unable to irrigate, and failing to achieve the yield-increasing effect of water conservancy. Many areas suffered from drought this summer, and it is estimated that soil moisture may be insufficient during the wheat planting season. A thorough watering should be carried out before deep plowing. This watering should be even and thorough. If the watering is not even, the soil will be unevenly dry and wet, and the quality of land preparation will be difficult to guarantee, which will affect full emergence.
    II. Comprehensive Fertilization, Economical Use of Fertilizer; Heavy Application of Basal Fertilizer and Winter Fertilizer, Early Application of Seedling Fertilizer When Basal Fertilizer is Insufficient
    Fertilizer is the prerequisite for high yield. The current problem is the lack of fertilizer, so we should seize the season to accumulate natural fertilizer and pay attention to comprehensive fertilization. High-yield plots should be heavily fertilized, and remote fields, barren land, and late-stubble land should also be properly taken care of. Achieve fertilization for every mu and high yield for every plot. At the same time, we must emphasize improving the quality of fertilizer. If we only pay attention to quantity but not quality, the labor and livestock power will be large and the effect will be small, which will cause a great waste.
    The higher the yield, the more fertilizer is needed; but fertilization is not the more the better. How much fertilizer is needed to produce how many catties of wheat? This issue is quite complex, because the soil fertility base varies from place to place, the quality of fertilizer varies greatly, and the fertilizer effect of different fertilizer types varies greatly under different cultivation conditions. Even for the same type and same quality of fertilizer, its utilization rate varies greatly under different application rates. According to the results of plant composition analysis of 32 wheat fields in Xushui, Gaocheng, Dingxian, Ningjin and other counties in Hebei Province and Beijing Agricultural University, for every 100 catties of wheat more harvested, the plant needs to absorb about 3 catties of pure nitrogen, 1 to 2 catties of phosphorus, and about 7 catties of potassium; as the yield increases, the proportion of nitrogen and potassium tends to increase, especially potassium. The Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences also obtained similar results when analyzing the plant composition of high-yield experimental fields and people's commune high-yield fields (the yields of the two fields were similar), and found that in the case of excessive fertilization, the increase in the absorption of nitrogen and potassium was mainly consumed on straw. Not only was the proportion of wheat straw larger, but the nitrogen and potassium consumed per catty of wheat straw also increased. Such nutrient utilization is uneconomical and obviously not the law of high-yield fertilization.
    According to the research of the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, under normal fertilization conditions to obtain a yield of 500 catties per mu, the absorption rate of grass pond mud is 51.6%; pig manure is 38.1%; compost is 34.6%; pond mud is 16.1%; and applying a small amount of chemical fertilizer has the effect of improving the nitrogen utilization rate. According to the survey in Hebei Province, about 7 to 8 catties of pure nitrogen are applied for every 100 catties of wheat more harvested. From the perspective of nitrogen fertilizer, the amount of fertilizer applied is about three times the amount absorbed.
    In 1959, various regions conducted a large number of fertilization surveys and experimental analyses. Many provinces have initially proposed fertilization quotas for different yield levels. For example:
     Hebei Province: A yield of about 300 catties per mu requires about 7,000 catties of soil manure and 15 catties of ammonium sulfate; a yield of about 500 catties per mu requires about 9,000 catties of soil manure and 35 catties of ammonium sulfate.
    Shandong Province: A yield of about 300 catties per mu requires about 3,000 catties of soil manure, 1,000 catties of human manure and urine, and 20 catties of ammonium sulfate; a yield of about 500 catties per mu requires about 5,000 to 7,000 catties of soil manure, 1,000 to 1,500 catties of human manure and urine, and 30 to 40 catties of ammonium sulfate.
    Jiangsu Province: A yield of about 300 catties per mu requires about 4,000 to 5,000 catties of pig ash manure; a yield of about 500 catties per mu requires about 8,000 to 10,000 catties of pig ash manure.
    The climatic conditions, soil fertility, and fertilizer quality in various regions vary greatly, so these figures are for reference only. Under China's specific conditions, for large fields with a yield of 200 to 300 catties per mu and even large-area high-yield plots with a yield of around 500 catties per mu, nitrogen fertilizer is still the main fertilizer. It is more appropriate to calculate the application amount of farm manure at three times the absorption amount based on the absorption of 3 catties of nitrogen per 100 catties of wheat.
    Years of practice and experiments have proven that applying sufficient basal fertilizer is the key to high wheat yield. How much basal fertilizer is appropriate? What is the ratio of basal fertilizer to topdressing? The situation varies from place to place, making it difficult to generalize. Areas with poor soil fertility should have a larger proportion of basal fertilizer; areas with high fertilization levels can have more basal fertilizer. Generally speaking, in China's current situation where farm manure is still used in large quantities, heavy application of basal fertilizer and increasing the proportion of basal fertilizer (referring to coarse fertilizer) to more than 50% is one of the important measures for economical use of fertilizer. If it is impossible to increase the application of basal fertilizer due to practical difficulties, seedling fertilizer should be applied as early as possible.
    In terms of basal fertilizer application technology, the following issues have been further clarified this year: 1. If the fertilizer is sufficient, apply fertilizer in layers in combination with deep plowing; and integrate soil and fertilizer; when the fertilizer is less, it should be concentrated in the surface layer, which is more conducive to the yield increase in the current season.
    2. Mixing superphosphate with organic fertilizer as basal fertilizer has a significant yield-increasing effect. According to the seedling stage survey in Yongnian, Xushui and other places in Hebei Province, the effective phosphorus in the soil of Class I seedlings is significantly higher, and the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil is 1:3:11.3 for Class I seedlings, 1:2.4:15.5 for Class II seedlings, and 1:1.3:10.8 for Class III seedlings, which appears to be very regular.
    3. In general areas of North China, especially in dryland, covering coarse manure in winter is not as good as using it as basal fertilizer.
    4. Mixing a small amount of ammonium sulfate when sowing (8 to 10 catties per mu) can increase the yield of 3 to 4 catties of wheat per catty of ammonium sulfate, which is more effective than using it as topdressing, and should be promoted in dryland, barren land and late-sown wheat fields.
    III. Determine the Number of Ears by Looking at the Fields, Determine the Number of Seedlings by Looking at the Ears, Determine the Number of Seeds by Looking at the Seedlings, Increase the Number of Plants and Ears, and Reasonably Dense Planting
    Over the past year, through production practice and extensive experimental research, a lot of experience has been gained in the theory and technology of reasonable dense planting. The main points are as follows:
    1. Within a certain density range, the yield per unit area increases as the number of ears increases; at the same time, high yield and stable harvest are obtained under the coordination of the three factors of more ears, larger ears, and larger grains. Jiangsu Province analyzed that those with a yield of 200 to 300 catties per mu have a number of ears between 200,000 and 300,000; those with a yield of 300 to 400 catties per mu have a number of ears between 250,000 and 350,000; and those with a yield of 400 to 500 catties per mu have a number of ears between 300,000 and 360,000. Hebei Province summarized that for every 100,000 ears added per mu within 500,000 ears, the yield increases by about 100 catties. On the other hand, many facts have also proven that the yield-increasing effect of increasing ears has its own limit. There is a certain contradiction between the number of ears and the size of ears per unit area. After the number of ears increases, the number of grains per ear is easy to decrease significantly. Secondly, because the grains will also become smaller to a certain extent, increasing the number of ears beyond a certain limit often cannot increase the yield due to the grains being too small.
    The experimental results of Yancheng, Jiangsu, typically illustrate the relationship between planting density and yield and its constituent factors. Under the conditions of this experiment, the highest yield was obtained when the density was appropriate (30 catties of sowing amount) and the number of ears, the number of grains, and the 1,000-grain weight were coordinated with each other. Simply requiring large ears without a large number of ears cannot obtain a high yield; conversely, if the density is too large and the number of ears is large, but the ears are too small, a high yield cannot be obtained either. According to the summary materials from various places, 600,000 to 700,000 ears in the north and 400,000 to 450,000 ears in the south may be a limit under the current cultivation level. If the number of ears exceeds this limit, the yield increase is small or does not increase, and the risk is very high.
    2. Correctly arrange the relationship between individuals and groups. There must be enough wheat seedlings and green area to utilize light and nutrition conditions to a greater extent, but it cannot be too dense to ensure that individual plants have proper growth and development.
    After the density increases, the nutrient area of a single plant decreases, the light intensity and temperature between plants decrease, the diurnal temperature difference becomes smaller, and the relative humidity increases. Therefore, a series of impacts are produced on the growth and development of wheat plants.
    In terms of tillering, as the density increases, the number of tillers per plant decreases, but within a certain limit, the total number of tillers per unit area increases. The maximum number of tillers is reached at the jointing stage, and then the tillers gradually die. Under field cultivation conditions, in addition to the main stem forming ears, some tillers also form ears; therefore, within a certain range, when the density is high, the total number of tillers including the main root stem is large, and the total number of ears is also large, so increasing the number of plants can increase the number of ears.
    After the number of plants and tillers increases, the leaf area increases, which is conducive to the utilization of light energy on the one hand, and aggravates the degree of shading on the other hand. The light intensity between plants (especially at the base) will be greatly reduced. The leaf area of a single plant and the total leaf area per mu increase with the growth of wheat seedlings and the increase of tillers, reaching the maximum at the booting and heading stages, and then gradually decreasing due to the gradual death of some leaves. As the density increases, the leaf area of a single plant decreases, but the leaf area index (the multiple of the total leaf area per mu greater than the land area) increases accordingly within a certain density range. If the leaf area is too large, the shading is heavy and the light is weak, which not only reduces the photosynthetic productivity and is not conducive to the synthesis and accumulation of organic matter, but also causes poor ear development and difficult lignification of stems when there are few carbohydrates and a high content of free nitrogen; this can cause excessive growth of leaves and weak stems, often leading to early lodging.
    According to the preliminary research results of Beijing, Shandong, Jiangsu and other places, the leaf area index should be controlled at 6 to 8 during the jointing and booting stages, and should not exceed 10.
    Relationship between Leaf Area, Yield and Lodging under Different Densities (Materials from the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 1959)
    Basic Seedling  Total Tillers  Number of Ears per Mu  Yield  Single Plant Leaf Area at Heading Stage  Leaf Area Index at Heading Stage  Lodging Situation
    (Ten Thousand)  (Ten Thousand)  (Ten Thousand)  (Catties)  (Square Centimeters)
    20      144    56    940     211     6.4     No Lodging
    56      222    101   682     107     8.9     Lodging Immediately at Heading Stage
    125     307    71    501     76.2    14.3    Lodging During Seedling Stage

    For the light intensity at the base between plants, it is appropriate to maintain it above 500 meter-candle at the jointing stage. The number of seedlings and tillers has a great relationship with the health of single plants and the size of the total leaf area. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly grasp the interrelationship between individuals and groups, and on the basis of sufficient basic seedlings, cultivate and control an appropriate number of tillers. The winter in the south is warm and humid, and the seedlings grow large and are prone to more tillers and early closure, so the planting density in the south should be smaller than that in the north. Generally speaking, under field cultivation conditions, the total number of tillers per mu can be maintained at about 800,000 in the south and about 1 million in the north before winter; at the jointing stage, it can be maintained at about 1 million in the south and about 1.2 million in the north. With better conditions in high-yield plots, 10% to 20% can be added on this basis.
    3. Relying on the main stem ears and having an appropriate number of tiller ears is a reliable way to increase the number of ears and increase the yield on a large area at present; tillers have a close relationship with strong seedlings, strong plants, and large ears. Increasing the number of ears to increase the yield is an important experience in wheat dense planting this year. Many facts further prove that under the cultivation conditions of general large fields and high-yield plots, whether the density is large or small, and the number of tillers is large or small, the ear formation rate of single plants is between 1.1 and 1.7, and rarely reaches 2 or more, indicating that the increase in ear production in large fields is mainly based on main stem ears, not on tiller ears, nor on both main stem ears and tiller ears. At the same time, in general large field conditions, tiller ears often perform worse than main stem ears. The former has fewer grains and a lower 1,000-grain weight. Moreover, the range of variation in the number of tillers and their ear formation rate is very large. Under the cultivation level of large fields, the certainty of relying on tillers to obtain high yields is not high.
    The growth and death of tillers is the biological characteristic of wheat. It is impossible to obtain high yields by relying solely on single-stem, single-ear without tillering. In the case of excessive density, tillers are born very late, very few, or even do not appear. Such wheat seedlings without tillers have weak stems and poor root development, and their subsequent yields are also low. Various places have consistently found that in terms of the number of grains and grain weight, single plants with tiller ears grow better than single plants with one ear; and in single plants with one ear, those with tillers grow better than those without any tillers. It is generally believed that although ineffective tillers die in the later stage and do not form ears, their roots can still serve the main stem and effective tillers, which is conducive to the ear formation and grain filling of single plants. As for the early stage of growth, tillers have a more significant effect on strengthening seedlings and plants. This year's experience has proven that having three to four tillers per plant (including the main stem) before winter, and finally forming an average of about one and a half ears, is most in line with the requirements of dense planting to increase yield. Therefore, only relying on main stem ears and having appropriate tiller ears is a reliable way to increase the number of ears and increase the yield on a large area. Advocating a large increase in the amount of seeds sown, relying solely on single-stem, single-ear, and advocating reducing the amount of seeds sown and relying on single plants with multiple tillers are both incomplete and do not meet the current requirements of dense planting to increase yield on a large area.
    4. It is necessary to coordinate corresponding measures in response to the needs of increasing the number of plants and ears for nutrition and light conditions. After dense planting, the number of plants, tillers, ears, and grains increases, which inevitably requires increased fertilizer application and appropriate watering. If fertilizer and water cannot keep up, not only will the ears become significantly inferior, but the increase in the number of ears will also be limited. It is not appropriate to use a higher density in the case of thin soil fertility and low fertilization levels. On the other hand, if excessive fertilization and watering will also cause excessive growth of stems and leaves, aggravating shading and causing early lodging. Only under the comprehensive effect of sufficient and reasonable control of fertilizer and water conditions can the normal and healthy development of seedlings, plants, ears, and grains be achieved.
    After the density is increased, narrow-row drilling and wide-row drilling are two sowing methods that are relatively easy to sow evenly, have better light transmission, and are convenient for field management operations. The row spacing of narrow-row drilling should be 4 to 6 inches. It can also be combined with sowing tools to implement a method of several dense rows and one sparse row to facilitate field management and intercropping. The width and spacing of wide-row drilling are generally appropriate to be 4 to 6 inches. In the case of intercropping, it can be appropriately widened to 6 to 8 inches.
    This year, it has been further understood that varietal characteristics, such as the number of tillers, the length and width of leaves, whether they are prone to drooping, and whether the stems are prone to lodging, are all related to the light transmission problem after greening. They must be considered when implementing reasonable dense planting. Varieties with short, narrow, upright leaves that are not prone to lodging can have a higher density; varieties with wider leaves that are prone to drooping or lodging should have a lower density; varieties with strong tillering ability should have a lower density, and vice versa.
    Based on the information currently available, the following are the preliminary reasonable density ranges for three major winter wheat regions:
         Reasonable Density Range of Major Winter Wheat Regions
    Region  Large Field   High-Yield Plot
     Sowing Amount   Basic Seedling  Number of Ears   Sowing Amount   Basic Seedling  Number of Ears
     (Catties/Mu)  (Ten Thousand/Mu)  (Ten Thousand/Mu)  (Catties/Mu)  (Ten Thousand/Mu)  (Ten Thousand/Mu)
    North China and Yellow River-Huai River-Wei River Basin  18-30  20-35  25-40  20-30  25-40  40-60
    Yangtze River Basin  18-25  20-30  25-35  20-30  25-35  35-45
    South China Region  15-20  18-25  20-30  18-25  20-30  30-40

    Within a region, the planting density needs to be determined based on the specific conditions of climate, cultivation level, varietal characteristics, and sowing time. Then, based on the requirements of the basic seedling, the sowing amount is determined according to the 1,000-grain weight or the number of grains per catty, germination rate, cultivation quality, soil moisture, and emergence rate.
    Suzhou, Jiangsu, summarized that grasping reasonable dense planting requires "determining the number of ears by looking at the fields, determining the number of seedlings by looking at the ears, and determining the number of seeds by looking at the seedlings." Hebei Province summarized that "increasing the number of ears to increase the yield is the goal, and increasing the number of seeds and plants is the means to achieve the goal." These are all important experiences in grasping planting density. Starting from sowing an appropriate amount of seeds and finally obtaining a high yield through more ears, larger ears, and larger grains, from increasing the number of seeds and plants to increasing the number of ears and increasing the yield, is a continuous process of promoting and controlling at each stage in response to the needs of wheat growth and development for light and nutrition conditions. It must be centered on dense planting and coordinated with other related measures to truly achieve the goal of increasing the number of ears and increasing the yield.
    IV. Select and Match Improved Varieties, Avoid Variety Uniqueness; Establish Seed Retention Land, Improve Seed Quality
    1. Expand the area of improved varieties in a planned way. On the basis of variety trials and production appraisals, select improved varieties that are proven to increase yield in combination with local conditions, and promote them in a planned way to avoid blindly exchanging seeds. Under conditions of low soil fertility (yield level below 200 catties), the yield of general farm varieties is relatively stable, and replacement should be cautious.
    2. Actively propagate reserve improved variety seeds. At present, in addition to the high-yield varieties that have been planted in large quantities in production, there are some new excellent varieties available for propagation and application in the main winter wheat regions. For example, in the northern winter wheat region, there are Nongda 183, Nongda 498, Huabei 187, etc.; in the Yellow River-Huai River-Wei River winter wheat region, there are Northwest 612, Shijiazhuang 407, Northwest 54, Northwest Fengshoumai, etc.; in the Yangtze River basin winter wheat region, there are Chuannong 51mai, Huadong No. 6, Huazhong No. 4, Jilimai, etc. It is urgent to focus on organizing state-owned farms and people's communes to accelerate seed propagation so that they can be applied to production as soon as possible.
    3. Do a good job in variety layout and avoid uniqueness. In order to stabilize yields and rationally allocate labor, each commune should plant three to four excellent varieties (including local improved varieties) in a way that suits local conditions to avoid accidental losses that may be brought about by variety uniqueness. In the past one or two years, Bima No. 1 has seriously lost its ability to resist rust in various places. In areas where the proportion of this variety is very high, other improved varieties should be prepared as soon as possible to gradually and partially replace Bima No. 1. It is estimated that the proportion of late-sown wheat fields will increase appropriately this autumn, and some improved varieties suitable for late sowing should be selected for planting (such as Nandai 2419, Baiyupi, Bima No. 1, etc.), which is beneficial to overall yield increase.
    4. Improve the purity of improved varieties and the sowing quality of seeds: At present, there is a common phenomenon of mixing in improved varieties, with a general mixing rate of around 20%, and individual severe areas can reach more than 50%. This autumn sowing should establish a planned improved variety breeding system, gradually achieving that communes have improved variety breeding farms, brigades have seed professional teams, and production teams have seed retention land to ensure the purity of improved varieties and maintain excellent seed traits. At the same time, pay attention to seed storage work, prevent insects and moisture, turn and dry them regularly, and strictly screen and water-select before sowing, and measure the germination rate.
    It needs to be specially pointed out that in recent years, the winters in North China have been relatively warm, and a few southern improved varieties have gradually expanded northward. Nandai 2419 has crossed the Yellow River, and Bima No. 1 has come out of the Great Wall. This is a new situation in the promotion of improved varieties. However, these two varieties have poor cold resistance. Whether they can stably increase yields in these new areas remains to be tested in the future. In this case, it is not appropriate to expand planting too quickly.
    V. Fight Drought and Drain Waterlogging, Sow in Due Time, and Cultivate Strong Seedlings
    Since the summer harvest, many areas have suffered from rare droughts and floods for many years. Therefore, preparations for drought resistance and waterlogging drainage for wheat planting must be made. In the land preparation work, if the soil moisture is not good, you can only harrow without plowing, or roll and harrow before sowing to retain moisture; in the drought-resistant sowing technology, you can use deep sowing to connect with moisture, furrow sowing with plows, seizing the moisture after rain to sow, hole sowing with water carrying, or water drill sowing. Press immediately after sowing, and if necessary, press again before emergence to facilitate emergence. Drought-resistant sowing has a low germination and emergence rate. Large-grained seeds should be strictly screened because large-grained seeds have strong germination potential and are more suitable for deep sowing; at the same time, the number of tillers will be sharply reduced after deep sowing, so the sowing amount should be appropriately increased. In order to promote emergence and strong seedlings, seeds can be soaked and sprouted or seeds that have undergone drought resistance training can be used.
    Drainage and wheat planting in waterlogged land should seize the time and plant one plot as soon as it is drained. The low-lying areas of North China have always had the habit of plowing with plow hooks or knife drills to plant wheat, which can be used when necessary. There is a lot of moisture in waterlogged land, making land preparation difficult. In the case where drill sowing can be carried out, the surface soil can be harrowed and broken before sowing; this saves time and improves sowing quality. Wheat planting in waterlogged land will inevitably delay the appropriate sowing period, and more processing should be done in management measures. Regardless of drought-resistant or waterlogging-draining wheat planting, the land preparation conditions are not very good. It is advisable to carry out harrowing of wheat during the tillering period before winter, and pressing and harrowing of wheat when the ground thaws in early spring to promote wheat seedling growth.
    In areas where drought and waterlogging do not occur, in order to strive for full and strong seedlings, it is necessary to master the appropriate sowing period. Sowing too early or too late, with wheat seedlings that are too vigorous or too weak, is detrimental to overwintering. Late-sown weak seedlings have slow growth and are prone to late-stage rust and drought damage, which will reduce yield and quality. The appropriate sowing period should be determined according to local climatic conditions, soil fertility, soil moisture, and varietal winter-spring characteristics. Dryland and thin land can be sown earlier because of slow seedling growth, and varieties with strong spring characteristics can be sown appropriately later.
    According to the research data of agricultural meteorology over the years, healthy wheat seedlings should have no less than three to four tillers (including the main stem) before winter. In the southern wheat region, it takes about 35 to 40 days from emergence to the growth of three tillers, and in the North China region, it takes about 40 to 45 days from emergence to the growth of four tillers. The temperature of the general appropriate sowing period is about between 15 and 18°C. As for the specific sowing period, dryland in northern North China is from White Dew to the end of September, irrigated land is from the Autumn Equinox to before the Cold Dew; the winter wheat region in the Yellow River-Huai River-Wei River Basin is from around the Cold Dew to mid-October; the Yangtze River Basin is between the Frost's Descent and the Beginning of Winter. When sowing Nandai 2419 in the area north of the Huai River and south of the Yellow River, because the variety has strong spring characteristics and poor cold resistance, it should be sown about 10 days later than the local customary sowing period. Starting from the overall yield increase, the sowing period should be properly arranged according to local conditions. In the land preparation and sowing, do a good job in the prevention and control of underground pests, and strictly grasp the drug application technology to avoid drug damage.
    Late-stubble wheat strives to be sown early and emerge early, and must have at least one tiller overwinter. In the south, the water in the previous rice field should be released appropriately early, and it should be harvested, plowed, and sown immediately after it is ripe; in the north, strive to cultivate and irrigate before the previous crop is harvested, and tidy up and sow immediately after harvest. In the land preparation and sowing, appropriately increase the basal fertilizer application, add fast-

    关于今年秋播小麦技术措施的几点意见
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    编者按　冬小麦播种季节即将到来，全国各地正在加紧进行播种的准备工作。为了争取明年冬小麦更大丰收，总结今年的丰产经验，改进今年的技术措施十分必要。下面这篇文章就是在这方面的一个努力，它是根据中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所最近召开的一次冬小麦丰产技术座谈会的讨论整理的，参加这个座谈会的有北京、河北、山东、河南、江苏、湖北、四川、陕西、甘肃等冬小麦主要种植区的农业科学研究所（院）的代表和北京农业大学、南京农学院等单位的代表。我们认为这篇文章值得参考。
    今年全国冬小麦又一次获得了全面大丰收。在丰产实践和试验研究中创造了许多丰富经验，积累了大量科学资料，明确了一些重要技术问题。为了争取明年冬小麦生产的更大跃进，我们结合今年北京、河北、河南、山东、江苏、湖北、四川、陕西、甘肃各地的丰产经验，对今年秋季播种冬小麦的若干技术问题，提出一些初步意见，供各地参考。
    一、耕深六至八寸，结合施肥熟化土壤；精耕细耙，平整土地
    深耕的效果是肯定的。它的增产幅度因原有耕层厚度和深耕程度、地力水平和施肥情况、土壤类型和耕地整地质量以及晒垡等具体情况而定，其中以施肥数量与质量的影响最大。旱地深耕由于改善了土壤水分状况，增产效果比水浇地明显。壤质冲积土由于整地质量较易掌握，深耕效果比粘土和水稻土为好。一年一熟地区的伏深耕，通过晒垡熟化了土壤，提高了肥力，深耕效果也很突出。
    河北、江苏、湖北等地不少对比材料表明，在一定范围内随着耕深的增加产量也逐渐上升。如河北省二十二个县，四十六个点、一百六十个深度对比统计，耕层从四至五寸加深到六至八寸时增产19.8％，加深到1尺左右时增产30.5％。深度如再加深，仍有一定增产作用，但增产幅度渐次减少，并且必须结合大量施肥；耕深超过二尺以上时，由于容易动乱土层、耕地整地质量不好、施肥量跟不上，反而减产。
    根据大量的观察资料，不论耕深从六至七寸以至于六至七尺，根系的密集层一般仍在零至六至九寸的土层以内，85％以上的根系也都在零至一点五尺的范围。这是因为土壤中氧气分布随深度的增加而递减，根系生长需要氧气，在缺氧的情况下，好气性土壤微生物如氨化菌、硝化菌、固氮菌、纤维分解细菌、矽酸盐细菌等的活动受到抑制，养分的转化过程发生障碍，根部组织的呼吸作用和代谢机能遭受破坏。另一方面，随着耕地深度的加深，劳畜力负担和机具损耗都急剧地增加。在南方稻麦两熟田如果翻得太深，第二年种水稻时平田花工很多，而且造成地面不均匀，稻苗生长不一致；同时在过深的烂泥中耕作比较困难，工作效率低，不利于水稻丰产栽培。
    针对这种情况，特别是考虑到目前劳畜力和机具性能的限制，不论南、北方，一般旱地耕深以六至八寸为宜，水田以六寸左右比较适当；丰产方如有条件可深耕到一尺左右。
    深耕必需结合增施肥料、熟化土壤，以便在短期内培养出深厚肥沃的土层。
    深耕必须坚持不乱土层，以免生土混入表层，降低表土肥力，并影响整地和播种质量。今年江苏、山东、河北、河南等地深耕对比材料都一致指出，混乱土层后，出苗率降低，植株生育差，产量显著下降。
    深耕还必须坚持精细整地，做到地平土碎，土肥混匀，这样才能保证苗齐苗旺，为丰产打下基础。上年有些社队，只注意深翻、不注意整地，形成地面起伏不平，大小坷垃满地，既影响出苗，又妨碍以后田间管理，产量难以提高。
    深耕整地要有全面观点，要抓紧时间，按茬口早晚排队。一年一熟的歇茬地要伏深耕、多晒垡，及时耙耱收墒；早茬地也要尽早秋深耕，适当晒垡；晚茬地要随收、随耕、随整地播种，为了抢时播种，耕地四至五寸左右即可，如劳畜力和机具跟不上而勉强深耕，以致耽误播种季节，则可能劳而无功，得不偿失。在这种情况下要多耙细耙，打碎土块，以利播种出苗。必须指明：抢时播种固然重要，平整土地也很重要，两者应该兼顾，只有在保证整地播种质量的基础上抢时播种才有增产作用。
    根据老农经验，在一般土壤上一次深耕八至十寸以上增产效果可以持续三至四年之久，以第二年为最好。因此，应该有计划地轮流深耕，使全部土地在三至四年内轮番深耕一遍。上年已经深翻的田地，今年秋季可以不再深耕，只按一般耕作标准整地播种。
    深耕同时要做好平整土地、修渠、做畦埂和兴修水利的工程，切实避免麦田有畦无水，坐视受旱减产，或有水无畦，高低不平，无法浇灌，难收水利增产之效。今年夏季不少地区受旱，估计种麦季节可能土壤水分不足，应在深耕前灌一次透水。这次一水要浇匀、浇透，如果浇不匀，土壤干湿不一致，整地质量难以保证，会影响全苗。
    二、全面施肥，经济用肥；重施基肥与腊肥，基肥不足时早施苗肥
    肥料是丰产的前提。当前的问题是肥料不足，应该抓紧季节积造自然肥料，并注意全面施肥，对于丰产方固然要多施肥料，对于远田、瘦地和晚茬地也都要适当照顾。做到亩亩有肥，块块丰产。同时还要强调提高肥料质量，如果只注意数量，不注意质量，花的劳畜力大而收效小，将会造成很大的浪费。
    产量愈高，需肥愈多；但施肥也不是越多越好。生产多少斤麦子需要上多少肥料呢？这个问题相当复杂，因为各处地力基础不一，肥料质量悬殊，不同肥料种类的肥效在不同的栽培条件下有很大的变异，即便是同一种类、同一质量的肥料，在不同的施肥量下，它的利用率也很有差别。根据河北省和北京农业大学在徐水、藁城、定县、宁津等县三十二块麦田的植株成分分析结果，每多收一百斤小麦，植株需要多吸收纯氮三斤左右，磷一至二斤，钾七斤上下；随着产量的增加，氮和钾的比重有增大的趋势，尤以钾素为明显。中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所在分析高产试验田和人民公社丰产田的植株成分时（两田产量相差不多）也得到类似的结果，并且看出在过多施肥的情况下，氮和钾吸收量的增加主要是消耗在藁秆上，不但麦草比例大了，每斤麦草所消耗的氮和钾也增加了。这样养分利用是不经济的，显然不是丰产的施肥规律。
    根据中国农业科学院江苏分院的研究，在正常施肥情况获得亩产五百斤的水平下，草塘泥的吸收率为51.6％；猪厩肥为38.1％；堆肥为34.6％；塘泥为16.1％；并且追施少量化肥有提高氮素利用率的作用。又据河北省的调查，每多收一百斤小麦约施纯氮七至八斤，从氮肥上看，施肥量约为吸收量的三倍。
    1959年各地都进行了大量的施肥调查和试验分析，不少省份已初步提出不同产量水平的施肥定额。例如：
      河北省：亩产三百斤约需土粪七千斤，硫铵十五斤；亩产五百斤约需土粪九千斤，硫铵三十五斤。
    山东省：亩产三百斤约需土粪三千斤，人粪尿一千斤，硫铵二十斤；亩产五百斤约需土粪五至七千斤，人粪尿一千至一千五百斤，硫铵三十至四十斤。
    江苏省：亩产三百斤约需猪灰粪四至五千斤；亩产五百斤约需猪灰粪八千至一万斤。
    各地的气候条件、土壤肥力和肥料质量相差很大，这些数字只供参考。在我国的具体条件下，亩产二百至三百斤的大田水平以至亩产五百斤上下的大面积丰产方，氮肥还是主要的，一般按每一百斤小麦吸收氮素三斤，农家肥料的施用量为吸收量的三倍计算，是比较适当的。
    多年的实践和试验证明，施足基肥是小麦丰产的关键。基肥究竟要施多少合适呢？基肥、追肥的比例怎样呢？各地情况不同，难以概括规定。地力基础差的，基肥比重要大些；施肥水平高的，基肥可以多些。一般地说，在我国目前还是大量使用农家肥料的情况下，重施基肥，把基肥（指粗肥）的比例提高到50％以上，是经济用肥的重要措施之一。如果限于实际困难，不能增施基肥时，应该抓紧时间早追苗肥。
    在基肥的使用技术上，今年进一步明确了以下几个问题：一、如果肥料充足则结合深耕分层施肥；并使土肥相融；肥料较少时，应集中施在表层，对当季增产更为有利。
    二、过磷酸钙和有机肥料混合做基肥，增产效果显著。根据河北省在永年、徐水等地的苗期调查，凡是一类苗土壤内有效磷显著的多，土壤中氮、磷、钾的比例，一类苗是1∶3∶11.3，二类苗是1∶2.4∶15.5，三类苗是1∶1.3∶10.8，显得很有规律。
    三、华北一般地区特别是旱地，冬季盖粗粪不如用做底肥好。
    四、少量硫铵混播（每亩八至十斤），每斤硫铵可增产三至四斤小麦，比用做追肥效果显著，在旱地、瘠薄地和晚播麦田上应该推行。三、看田定穗、看穗定苗、看苗定籽，增株增穗，合理密植一年来通过生产实践和广泛的试验研究，对于合理密植问题，在理论上和技术上都已取得不少经验，其中主要的有以下四点：
    1、在一定的密度范围内，单位面积产量随着穗数增加而增加；同时，高产而稳收是在穗多、穗大、粒大三者相互协调情况之下获得的。江苏省分析：亩产二百至三百斤的，穗数在二十至三十万之间；亩产三百至四百斤的，穗数在二十五至三十五万之间；亩产四百至五百斤的，穗数在三十至三十六万之间。河北省总结：每亩穗数在五十万以内，每增加十万穗，增加产量一百斤左右。另一方面，也有许多事实证明，增穗的增产作用是有其一定限度的，单位面积内穗多少和穗大小存在着一定的矛盾，穗数增加之后，首先每穗粒数易于显著减少，其次由于籽粒也会在一定程度上变小，增加穗数超过一定限度，往往由于穗粒过小，不能增产。
    江苏盐城的试验结果，很典型地说明种植密度和产量及其构成因素的关系。在该试验的条件下，最高产量是在密度适当（三十斤播种量），穗数、粒数、千粒重三者相互协调的情况下获得的。单纯要求大穗，而穗数不多，不能获得高产；反之，密度过大，穗数虽多，但穗头过小，也不能获得高产。根据各地总结材料，北方六十至七十万穗、南方四十至四十五万穗可能是目前栽培水平下的一个界限。穗数超过这个限度，增产幅度小，或者不增产，并且风险很大。
    2、正确安排个体与群体的关系。既要有足够的麦苗和绿色体面积，在较大程度上利用光照和营养条件，又不能过密，以保证单株有适当的生长发育。
    密度加大之后，单株营养面积缩小，株间光照强度和气温降低，昼夜温差变小，相对湿度增加。因而在小麦植株生长发育上产生了一系列的影响。
    在分蘖方面，密度加大，单株分蘖数递减，但在一定限度之内，单位面积内总分蘖数则递增，拔节时期达到最大分蘖数以后，分蘖逐渐死亡，在大田栽培条件下，除主茎成穗外，还有部分分蘖成穗；因而在一定的范围内，密度较大时，包括主根茎在内的总分蘖多，总穗数也多，所以增株能够增穗。
    株、蘖增多之后，叶面积加大，一方面有利于利用光能，一方面又加重荫蔽程度，株间（特别是基部）的光照强度就会大大减低。单株叶面积和每亩总叶面积随着麦苗的长大和分蘖的增多而加大，到孕穗、抽穗时期最大，其后由于部分叶片逐渐枯死，叶面积又逐渐减小。密度加大，单株叶面积减小，但叶面积系数（每亩总叶面积大于土地面积的倍数）在一定密度范围内则相应增大。叶面积过大，荫蔽重，光照弱，不但光合生产率转而降低，不利于有机物质的合成和累积，同时在碳水化合物形成少、游离氮含量多的情况下，穗部发育不良，茎秆难于木质化；引起叶片徒长，茎秆细弱，往往发生早期倒伏。
    根据北京、山东、江苏等地初步研究的结果，拔节、孕穗时期，叶面积系数以掌握六至八为适宜，不宜超过十。
    不同密度下叶面积和产量及倒伏的关系	（中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所材料，1959年）基本苗  总分蘖数  每亩穗数  亩产  抽穗期单  抽穗期叶   倒伏（万）	（万）	  （万）   （斤） 株叶面积  面积系数   情况
    			        （平方厘米）20      144	  56	   940	   211	     6.4     未倒伏56	222	  101	   682     107	     8.9     抽穗期						     即倒伏125	307 	  71	   501     76.2      14.3    苗期即
                                                     倒伏
    对于株间基部光照强度，拔节时期宜保持在五百米烛光以上。苗数、分蘖数多少对于单株健壮程度和总叶面积大小的关系很大，因此，必须正确掌握个体和群体的相互关系，在足够的基本苗的基础上，一面培育，一面控制适当数量的分蘖。南方冬季温暖润湿，幼苗生长肥大，易于多分蘖和早封行，所以南方的种植密度宜小于北方。总的看来，在大田栽培条件之下，冬前每亩总分蘖南方可保持在八十万左右，北方在一百万左右；拔节期，南方可保持一百万左右，北方在一百二十万左右，丰产方条件较好，可在此基础上酌加一至二成。
    3、依靠主茎穗，并有适量的分蘖穗，是目前大面积增穗增产的可靠途径；分蘖对于壮苗、壮株、大穗有密切关系。增穗增产是今年小麦密植栽培的一项重要经验。许多事实进一步证明，在一般大田和丰产方的栽培条件下，密度或大或小，分蘖有多有少，单株成穗率都在一点一至一点七之间，很少达到二或二以上，说明大田的多穗增产是以主茎穗为主，而不是以分蘖穗为主，也不是主茎穗和分蘖穗并重。同时在一般大田情况下，分蘖穗表现往往不如主茎穗，前者粒数较少，千粒重较低。并且，分蘖多少及其成穗率大小的变动幅度很大，在大田栽培水平下依靠分蘖取得高产的把握不大。
    分蘖的生长和死亡是小麦的生物学特性，单纯依靠不分蘖的独秆单穗而获得高产是不可能的。在过密情况下，分蘖出生很迟很少，甚至不出现分蘖，这种没有分蘖的麦苗茎秆细弱，根系发育不好，其后产量也不高。各地一致检查到在粒数和粒重方面，有分蘖成穗的单株比一个穗子的单株长得好；在一个穗子的单株中，有分蘖的比完全没有分蘖的长得好。一般认为无效分蘖虽在后期死亡，没有成穗，其根系仍然能为主茎和有效分蘖服务，有利于单株长穗结粒。至于在生长前期，分蘖对于壮苗壮株的作用更为显著。今年经验证明，在冬前每株（包括主茎在内）有三至四个分蘖，最后平均成穗一个半左右，最符合密植增产的要求。所以，只有依靠主茎穗，并有适当分蘖穗，才是大面积增穗增产的可靠途径。主张大量增加播种量，单纯依靠独秆单穗，以及主张减少播种量，依靠单株多蘖，都是不全面、不符合目前大面积密植增产的要求的。
    4、必须针对增株、增穗对于营养和光照条件的需要，配合相应的措施。密植之后，株、蘖、穗、粒增多，必然要增施肥料，适当浇水。肥水跟不上，不但穗头会显著变劣，穗数增加也会受到限制。在地力较瘦、施肥水平不高的情况下，就不宜采用较高的密度。另一方面，如果施肥、浇水过量也会引起茎叶徒长，加重荫蔽，发生早期倒伏。只有在肥水条件充足供应和合理控制相结合的综合作用下，才能达到苗、株、穗、粒正常健壮的发展。
    密度加大以后，窄行条播和宽幅条播是两个比较易于匀播、透光较好、又便于田间管理操作的播种方式。窄行条播的行距以四至六寸为宜，也可以结合播种工具实行几行密、一行稀的办法，以利田间管理和间种套种。宽幅条播一般以播幅和幅距各为四至六寸为宜，在套种情况下可以适当放宽到六至八寸。
    今年进一步了解到品种特性，如分蘖多少、叶片长短、宽窄，是否易于披垂，茎秆是否易于倒伏，都和返青以后的透光问题有关，在进行合理密植时都须加以考虑。凡是叶片短窄、直立，不易倒伏的品种，密度可大些；叶片较宽大，容易披垂，或容易倒伏的品种，密度应小些；分蘖力强的品种，密度应小些，反之，应大些。
    现在根据已经掌握的资料初步提出三个主要冬小麦地区的合理密度范围如下：
                  主要冬麦区的合理密度范围地区	大　田		         丰产方	
     播种量   基本苗    穗　数   播种量     基本苗    穗　数
   （斤／亩）（万／亩）（万／亩）（斤／亩）（万／亩）（万／亩）华北及黄淮渭流域 18—30 20—35  25—40   20—30    25—40    40—60长江流域 18—25 20—30  25—35   20—30    25—35    35—45华南地区 15—20 18—25  20—30   18—25    20—30    30—40
    在一个地区之内，还需要根据气候条件、耕作栽培水平、品种特性、播种时期等具体情况决定种植密度。然后针对基本苗的要求，根据千粒重或每斤粒数、发芽率、整地质量、墒情和出苗率等决定播种量。
    江苏苏州总结提出，掌握合理密植，需要“看田定穗，看穗定苗，看苗定种”，河北省总结提出：“增穗增产是目的，增子增株是达到目的的手段。”这都是掌握种植密度的重要经验。由播种了适量的种子开始到最后透过穗多、穗大、粒大而获得高产，从增子增株到增穗增产，是一个针对小麦生长发育对于光照和营养条件的需要，不断促进、节节掌握的过程，必须以密植为中心，配合上其它有关措施，才能确实达到增穗增产的目的。
    四、选配良种，避免品种单一化；建立留种地，提高种子质量
    1、有计划地扩大良种面积。在通过品种试验和生产鉴定的基础上，结合当地具体条件，选出确实表现增产的良种，进行有计划的推广，避免盲目调种。在地力较低条件下（二百斤以下的产量水平）一般农家品种产量比较稳定，更换时应慎重。
    2、积极繁殖后备良种种子。目前各主要冬麦区，除了在生产上已经大量种植的丰产品种以外，都有一些新的优良品种可供繁殖应用。例如，北部冬麦区有农大183、农大498、华北187等；黄淮渭冬麦区有西北612、石家庄407、西北54、西北丰收麦等；长江流域冬麦区有川农51麦、华东6号、华中4号、吉利麦等，急需有重点地组织国营农场与人民公社加速繁殖种子，以便早日扩大应用于生产。
    3、做好品种布局，避免单一化。为了稳定产量和合理调配劳力，每个公社要因地制宜配合种植三至四个优良品种（包括地方良种），避免品种单一化所可能带来的意外损失。近一、二年来，碧蚂一号在各地已严重丧失其抗锈病能力，在这一品种分布比重很大的地区应及早准备其他良种，以便逐步地、部分地代替碧蚂一号。今年秋季晚播麦田比重估计将会适当增加，应选用一些适合晚播的良种种植（如南大2419、白玉皮、碧蚂一号等），对于全面增产是有利的。
    4、提高良种纯度和种子的播种质量：目前良种普遍存在混杂现象，一般混杂率在20％上下，个别严重地区可达50％以上。今年秋播时要有计划地建立良种繁育制度，逐步做到公社有良种繁育场，大队有种子专业队，生产队有留种地，保证良种纯净，保持优良种性。同时注意种子保管工作，防虫防潮、定时翻晒，播种前严格进行筛选水选，并测定发芽率。
    需要特别提出的是，近年来华北地区冬季比较温暖，少数南方良种逐渐向北扩张，南大2419已跨过黄河，碧蚂1号已出了长城，这是良种推广的一个新局面。但是，这两个品种抗寒性较差，在这些新地区能否稳定增产，还有待今后继续考验，在这种情况下，不宜过快地扩大种植。
    五、抗旱排涝，适期播种，培育壮苗
    夏收以来不少地区分别遭受多年罕见的旱涝灾害。因此，不能不做抗旱和排涝种麦的准备。在整地工作中，如果墒情不好，可以只耙不耕，或在播种前碾耱提墒；在抗旱播种技术上可以采用深播接墒、套犁沟播、雨后抢墒播种、挑水穴播或水耧播种等办法。随播种随镇压，必要时出土前还要镇压，以利出苗。抗旱播种，发芽出土率低，要严格筛选大粒种子，因为大粒种子发芽势强，较宜于深播；同时深播之后分蘖锐减，应该酌量增加播种量。为了促进出苗和壮苗，可以采用浸种催芽或经过抗旱锻炼的种子。
    涝地排水种麦要抓紧时间，排一块、种一块。华北低洼地区一向有用犁钩犁或刀耧种麦的习惯，必要时可以采用。涝地水分多，整地困难，在可以进行耧播的情况下，把表土耙碎即可播种；这样既争取时间又提高播种质量。涝地种麦难免要延误播种适期，在管理措施上应多加工。无论抗旱或排涝种麦，整地情况都不很好，宜在冬前分蘖期进行耙麦，和早春解冻时压麦与耙麦，以促进麦苗生育。
    在不发生旱涝的地区，为了争取苗全苗壮，必须掌握适期播种。播种过早、过晚，麦苗过旺、过弱，对于越冬都是不利。晚播弱苗生育迟缓，容易遭受后期锈病和旱风侵袭，产量、品质都要降低。适宜的播种期应根据当地气候条件、地力、土壤水分和品种冬春性等情况而定。旱地、薄地因幼苗生长迟缓，宁可播种早些，春性较强的品种可适当晚播。
    根据历年农业气象的研究资料，健壮麦苗在冬前分蘖应不少于三至四个（包括主茎）。在南方麦区，从出苗到长出三个分蘖，约需三十五至四十天上下，在华北地区，从出苗到长出四个分蘖，需时四十至四十五天左右。一般播种适期的气温约在15—18℃之间。就具体的播种期而言，华北北部旱地在白露至9月底，水浇地在秋分至寒露前；黄淮渭河流域冬麦区在寒露前后至10月中旬；长江流域在霜降至立冬之间。在淮河以北、黄河以南地区播种南大2419时，由于该品种春性强、抗寒性差，应该比当地习惯播种期晚十天左右。从全面增产出发，应该因田制宜、妥善安排播种期。在整地播种时要做好地下害虫的防治工作，并需严格掌握施药技术，以免发生药害。
    晚茬麦力争早种早出，至少要有一个分蘖过冬。在南方，前作稻田适当提前放水，一成熟即抢收、抢耕、抢种；在北方，前茬收获前争取中耕灌水，收后即时整理播种。在整地播种时，适当增施基肥，加用速效性氮、磷肥做种肥，并选用适宜晚播、具有抗锈、耐旱风、早熟等特点的优良品种，出苗后加强苗期管理，提早追肥灌水，促使分蘖扎根。晚播麦苗扎根浅，初期易遭蝼蛄为害，冬季容易凌抬，出苗后和冬春期间宜加镇压。近两年无数的实践证明，晚播麦田只要措施跟上，同样能够获得高产。
    必须强调指出，在一般情况下，抢时播种，不误农时，是在基本上保证整地和播种质量的前提下进行的。如果整地质量达不到起码要求，则宁可延迟一、二日，把地整好再行播种。
    我国麦区辽阔，各地情况不同，小麦增产的途径和办法不可能一样。以上所提的几个方面，只是初步意见，在具体制定1960年冬小麦增产措施时，必须广泛发动群众讨论，在总结本地区今年麦季丰收的基础上，结合吸收外地经验，订出切实可行和行之有效的增产办法。
