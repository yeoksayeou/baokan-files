    Guizhou, Benxi, and Changsha Steel Workers Full of Enthusiasm
    Striving for High Quality and High Yield in Every Furnace

    Xinhua News Agency News: After studying the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers on the steel front in Guizhou Province are determined to fight hard in September and present a gift to the great 10th anniversary of the National Day by completing the annual steel production plan two and a half months ahead of schedule.

    According to this leap forward plan, in recent days, the workers of various steelmaking units have held meetings to discuss and revise production targets, and have taken many measures. Socialist labor competitions have been launched between workshops, furnaces, shifts, and individuals in various steelmaking units to overcome technical barriers. The steelmaking workshop of Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory, in response to the high sulfur content of pig iron, has established a technical research group led by Zhang Shihua, deputy director of the workshop, and is working to convert the cupola and steelmaking converter into alkaline furnaces with better desulfurization effects. After adopting alkaline furnaces, the Guizhou General Machinery Factory has increased the qualified rate of steel to over 85% in the first four days of September. Many leading cadres of various steelmaking units have personally gone to the front line to direct production. Ma Chaohe, the Party Secretary of Guiyang Central Foundry, and Chen Geguo, the Deputy Director, went to the steelmaking workshop and worked with technicians and veteran workers to improve the cooling equipment of the cupola and explore some new operating experiences, which greatly extended the furnace life.

    Recently, the daily output of steel in various units has been rising steadily. Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant, the main force of steelmaking in the province, created a new record of producing more than 151 tons of steel per day on the 3rd, and then created the highest record of producing 179 tons of steel per day on the 4th. From September 1st to 6th, the average daily output of steel in the province increased by about 56% compared with the average daily output in August.

    Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, September 12th: After achieving the competition proposal of reaching a blast furnace utilization coefficient of 2.3 proposed at the beginning of the year in August, Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has created excellent production results in the first ten days of September. The average blast furnace utilization coefficient in these ten days increased from 2.419 in August to 2.585, and the pig iron output exceeded the national plan by 11%, with all pig iron produced being qualified. The Youth No. 1 blast furnace, which recently proposed five indicators in response to Anshan Iron and Steel's initiative, created a new record of an average utilization coefficient of 2.66 in the first ten days of September.

    Since entering September, under the encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the cadres and workers of the entire plant have proposed to strive to complete the national plan ahead of schedule and welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Leading cadres at all levels in the plant have gone deep into the production site to direct production. Workers in various workshops and work sections have launched various forms of friendly competitions such as "opponent," "single item," and "key."

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 13th: Changsha City, Hunan Province, has completed the third quarter steel production plan 2% ahead of schedule by twenty-three days. Steel production increased by 6% compared with the second quarter; the qualified rate of steel ingots reached 95.17%, an increase of 6.71% compared with the second quarter; the cost of steelmaking has also been reduced, with iron consumption per ton of steel reduced by 20% in August compared with June, and unit coke consumption reduced by about 35%.

    The third quarter was the season of hot and high temperatures. Under the slogan of "Fight High Temperatures and Seize Double Highs (High Output and High Quality)," the steelmaking fighters in Changsha City insisted on opening furnaces to make steel every day, striving for high quality and high yield in every furnace. Especially since August, after studying the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-leaning Emotions and Practice Increasing Production and Practicing Economy," and then studying the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they criticized and overcame the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres. The workers' fighting spirit was even higher, and steel production therefore increased by leaps and bounds. For example, comparing the first five days of September with July, the average daily output increased by 1.4 times.

    贵州、本溪、长沙钢铁职工干劲十足
    力争炉炉优质高产
    新华社讯　贵州省钢铁战线上的职工，学习了党的八届八中全会公报和决议后，决心大战9月，以提前两个半月完成全年产钢计划的成就，来向伟大的国庆十周年献礼。
    根据这一跃进计划，这些天来，各炼钢单位的职工纷纷开会讨论，修改了生产指标，采取了许多措施，各炼钢单位开展了车间与车间、炉与炉、班与班、人与人之间的社会主义劳动竞赛，猛攻技术关。贵阳矿山机器厂炼钢车间针对生铁含硫量较高的情况，由车间副主任张世华领导建立了技术研究小组，正着手把化铁炉和炼钢转炉改为去硫效果较好的碱性炉。贵州通用机械厂采用碱性炉后，9月份头四天钢的合格率已提高到85％以上。各炼钢单位许多领导干部都亲临第一线指挥生产。贵阳中心铸造厂党委书记马超合和副厂长陈格国，到炼钢车间与技术员、老工人共同研究改进了化铁炉的冷却设备，摸索出一些新的操作经验，使炉龄大大延长。
    近来，各单位钢的日产量都在节节上升。全省炼钢主力贵阳钢铁厂，3日创造日产钢一百五十一吨多的新纪录后，4日又创造了日产钢一百七十九吨的最高纪录。9月1日到6日，全省钢的平均日产量，比8月份平均日产量增加了56％左右。
    据新华社本溪12日电　本溪第一钢铁厂8月份实现了年初提出的高炉利用系数达到二·三的竞赛倡议以后，9月上旬又创造了优异的生产成绩。这十天的高炉平均利用系数，由8月份的二·四一九提高到二·五八五，生铁产量超过国家计划11％，所产生铁全部合格。最近提出五项指标响应鞍钢倡议的青年一号高炉，9月上旬又创造了平均利用系数二·六六的新纪录。
    进入9月以来，全厂的干部和职工在党的八届八中全会的鼓舞下，提出力争提前完成国家计划，迎接国庆十周年。厂内的各级领导干部，深入生产现场指挥生产。各车间、工段的职工，展开了“对手”、“单项”、“关键”等多种形式的友谊竞赛。
    新华社长沙13日电　湖南省长沙市已提前二十三天超额2％完成第三季度钢的生产计划。钢产量比第二季度增长6％；钢锭合格率达95.17％，比第二季度提高6.71％；炼钢成本也有降低，8月份每炼一吨钢的铁耗比6月份降低20％，单位焦耗降低35％左右。
    第三季度正值酷暑高温季节，长沙市的炼钢战士在“战高温、夺双高（高产高质）”的口号下，坚持天天开炉炼钢，力争炉炉优质高产。特别是从8月份以来，职工们学习了人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，随后又学习了党的八届八中全会公报和决议，批判克服了部分干部的右倾保守思想，工人们斗志更高，钢产量因此飞跃增长。如以9月份前五天与7月份比较，平均日产量提高了一点四倍。
