The arts and crafts of Fujian Province are not only renowned at home and abroad for their long history and unique style, but also for their magnificent diversity. These excellent traditions have been further developed and enhanced since liberation, following the Party and the state's policy of protecting, developing, and improving arts and crafts. The ranks of artisans increased more than sevenfold in 1958 compared to 1950. The variety of designs is not only constantly changing, but the artistic level of many products has reached a state of divine craftsmanship.

Unfading Bodiless Lacquerware
Lacquer carving masterpieces rival nature's skill,
Meticulous likeness, not just going through the motions;
A hundred flowers bloom with skillful hands,
From now on, the world recognizes the East Wind.

This is a poem written by Comrade Lin Boqu, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, during his visit to the Fuzhou Bodiless Lacquerware Factory in Fujian this February. Fuzhou bodiless lacquerware is meticulously crafted from silk, grass cloth, and high-quality lacquer. It is divided into three major categories: fully bodiless, semi-bodiless, and wood-bodied lacquerware. Originally, it was a family secret of the Shen Shao'an family in Fuzhou. It was not until Shen Zheng'gao passed it on to apprentices and promoted it more than fifty years ago that it was widely known. This kind of lacquerware, from cups, spoons, teapots, and smoking sets that are appreciated by both refined and popular tastes, to giant statues of great people, screens, and various antique-like shapes such as vases and Buddha statues, are all exquisitely beautiful and lifelike. Not only are they beautiful and gorgeous in appearance, but they are also solid, light, and very durable, without deforming, peeling, or fading when the temperature reaches freezing or boiling point. The "Ao Yu Peach Plate" made by Shen Zheng'gao more than fifty years ago still has the color of the huge flat peach like a real peach.

This lacquer art, which has long been famous at home and abroad, is made under the guidance of veteran lacquer artists such as Gao Xiuquan and Li Zhiqing. For example, various lacquer bottles such as "Seven Treasures Sand," "Gold Thread Agate," and "Green Treasure Flash" are moving for their bright colors and exquisite craftsmanship. On a "Transparent Dark Pattern" bottle, several red carp swimming among the seaweed are depicted. After adding a layer of thin, gauze-like transparent lacquer, they seem to be sometimes hidden and sometimes visible on the surface of the water, making people unimaginable.

Ingenious Carvings
Fujian Province's folk carving arts and crafts are divided into several major categories, such as stone carving, wood carving, and lacquer carving, and are also known for their meticulousness, refinement, and magnificent diversity. After liberation, in terms of the content of the works, it has developed from the past when it could only carve historical heroes, folk legends, and flowers, birds, and trees, to now being able to vividly reflect realistic production and struggle with a high level of artistic skill. Wood carvings such as "Chairman Mao at the Ming Tombs Reservoir," "Border Guards," "Combination of Labor and Military Affairs," and "Model Breeder," and stone carvings such as "High-Yielding Sow," "Courting Chicken," and "Bumper Harvest of Fishery" and other masterpieces reflecting real life are not only vivid in form and spirit, but also carve delicate objects such as hollow chicken coops and fishing nets on stubborn stones.

The "Fruit Basket" stone carving created by young artist Zhou Zebin and the "Deer Bamboo Eternal Spring, Pine Crane Longevity" wood carving created by artist Lin Hengyun have added even more brilliance to Fujian's carving art. On a stubborn and unyielding colored stone, Zhou Zebin gave full play to the exquisite artistry and wonderful talent of "assessing the stone's potential and cleverly matching nature," using the colors of vermilion, light yellow, yellow, and white to carve a string of vermilion lychees that are similar in shape. He also interestingly matched peanuts, loquats, snow lotus roots, grapes, and Buddha's hands to form a beautifully shaped fruit basket, and two lychees in the basket that have just been peeled a little bit reveal crystal clear and plump pulp. Many old stone carving artists, after seeing these creations, all praised them as "the younger generation is to be feared," and that the students have surpassed the teachers. In order to thank the Party and the state for their emphasis on folk crafts, woodcarving artist Lin Hengyun depicted the peaceful scene of longevity and prosperity in the ten years since the founding of the country, and carved a three-dimensional wood carving of "Deer Bamboo Eternal Spring, Pine Crane Longevity" on a precious boxwood wood two feet high and one foot in diameter. On this giant wood carving masterpiece, eight red-crowned cranes are circling above an ancient pine tree, flapping their wings and about to fly, or raising their necks and screaming, each doing their best. Beside the bamboo forest under the pine tree, a group of deer are leisurely and content, and the mother deer is feeding the baby deer with Ganoderma lucidum grass in her mouth.

Simple and Elegant Bamboo Weaving
Fujian is one of the main bamboo producing areas in my country. Throughout history, the working people have used their nimble hands and artistic talents to weave readily available green bamboo and Fujian's special spotted bamboo, phoenix eye bamboo, Xiangfei bamboo, sika deer bamboo, rabbit face bamboo, and purple bamboo into beautiful and practical arts and crafts such as baskets, bottles, mats, table lamps, and stationery. For example, Yongchun County and other places use long-section green bamboo to weave bamboo mats, bamboo pillows, etc. Their thickness and toughness are like a heavy-duty drawing paper. After the artists skillfully cut and weave them, people can't find any traces of bamboo joints or the front and back of the mat. The symmetry of the woven patterns and patterns is very beautiful and delicate. Therefore, people not only use it in daily life, but also Gufeng flower baskets, Yongchun lacquer baskets, etc. are a good gift and a tool for holding gifts.

Reviving the Glory of Ceramics
Fujian has also been a famous hometown of ceramic art and crafts in history. For example, Dehua fine porcelain, which is as delicate as jade and exquisitely translucent, and Changle Huangshi pottery, which is simple, generous, and full of folk colors, are very famous. After liberation, through the efforts of new and old artists and the research and exploration of relevant departments, Dehua fine porcelain and blue-and-white painted porcelain, which had been lost for decades, have been restored to production. The product quality and variety of designs are also booming, exceeding the highest level in history. The plain white floating flower and applique porcelain, when lined with gold-colored paintings, shows its splendor and loveliness. The famous Changle Huangshi pottery has a flower-inlaid wine pot with eight treasures patterns on the body of the pot. It has been introduced by local newspapers and magazines in more than ten foreign exhibitions, praising it as a simple, honest, pleasing to the eye spectacle.

World-Renowned Puppet Heads
Fujian Province not only has a high level of puppet performance art, but also the puppet heads carved for puppet performances have become famous at home and abroad. Among them, there are three main categories: Quanzhou puppet heads using Liyuan Opera masks, Shima puppet heads using Peking Opera masks, and Zhangzhou puppet heads that combine Han and Hakka Opera masks. In addition, the new faces created by artists from observing life and various humanized animal heads carved by art and craft artists can be described as diverse and complete.

    瑰丽多采的福建美术工艺
    福建省的美术工艺不仅具有悠久的历史和独特的风格，同时还以其瑰丽多采而名闻中外。这些优良的传统，在解放以来，贯彻执行了党和国家的保护、发展、提高的美术工艺工作方针以后，进一步发扬光大，艺人队伍，1958年比1950年增加七倍多。花色品种不仅日新月异，同时许多产品的艺术水平已达到巧夺天工的境界。
    永不褪色的脱胎漆器
    漆雕精品夺天工，
    唯妙唯肖不苟同；
    齐放百花双手巧，
    世人从此识东风。
    这是中共中央政治局委员林伯渠同志今年2月来福建参观福州脱胎漆器厂时所写的一首诗。福州脱胎漆器是用丝绸、夏布和上等漆料作材料精制出来的，分有全脱胎、半脱胎、木胎漆器三大类，原来是福州沈绍安家传绝技，直到五十多年前传到沈正镐时，方才收徒传艺推广。这种漆器小至雅俗共赏的一杯一勺、茶壶烟具，大到全身伟人巨像、屏风等造型以及花瓶、佛像等诸般古玩无不精美绝伦，唯妙唯肖。不仅外表美观、华丽，而且质固体轻，非常耐用，在温度达到冰点或沸点时，都不变形、落漆或掉色。五十多年前沈正镐手制的“鳌鱼桃盘”，至今，巨大的蟠桃色彩还像真桃一样。
    这种久已名闻中外的漆器艺术品，是在漆器老艺人高秀泉、李芝卿等的指导下制作的。例如“七宝砂”、“金丝玛瑙”、“绿宝闪光”等各种漆瓶，都以它们的色泽光亮技艺精美而感动人，有一只“透明暗花”瓶上描绘的几尾浮游在水藻之间的闪红鲤鱼，在加上一层薄纱似的透明漆溶之后，竟然宛如鲜鱼时隐时现在水面之间，令人难以遐想。
    巧夺天工的雕刻
    福建省的民间雕刻美术工艺分为石刻、木雕、漆雕——等几大类，也以其细致精湛和瑰丽多采而著称。解放后在作品内容方面，从过去的仅能雕刻历史英雄人物、民间传说和花鸟禽木发展到现在能栩栩如生地反映现实生产和斗争的艺术水平很高的作品。木雕“毛主席在十三陵水库”、“边防战士”、“劳武结合”、“模范饲养员”和石刻“丰产母猪”、“求偶鸡”、“渔业丰收”等反映现实生活的佳作，不但形神兼备、生动逼真，而且是在顽石上刻出镂空的鸡罩、渔网等细微的物件。
    青年艺人周则斌创作的“水果篮”石刻，艺人林亨云创作的“鹿竹长春、松鹤遐龄”木雕，更为福建雕刻艺术放出了异采。在一块冥顽不灵的彩石石头上，周则斌发挥了“审度石势，巧配天然”的精巧艺法和奇妙才思，利用丹红、浅黄、黄、白等石色刻出了形实相似的一串丹红荔枝，又趣味盎然地配上了花生、枇杷、雪藕、葡萄和佛手等，形成一座造形精美的水果篮，而篮中两颗刚剥去一点皮的荔枝，露出晶莹丰满的果肉。许多老石刻艺人在看到这些创作之后，都有“后生可畏”，青出于蓝而胜于蓝的赞许。木刻艺人林亨云为了感谢党和国家对民间工艺的重视，描绘建国十年来人寿年丰的升平景象，在一根高二尺、直径一尺的名贵黄杨木上，雕刻出了一座“鹿竹长春、松鹤遐龄”的立体木雕。在这座木雕巨作上，八只丹鹤，正盘旋在一株古松上面展翅欲飞或引颈啸唳，各尽其姿，苍松下的竹林边，群鹿悠闲自得，母鹿口衔灵芝草在喂哺乳鹿。
    浑朴有致的竹编
    福建是我国主要竹材产区之一，历来劳动人民就以其灵巧的双手和艺术天才，运用到处可见的青竹和福建特产的豹纹、凤眼、湘妃、梅鹿、兔面、紫斑等竹材编制成篮、瓶、席、台灯和文具等美观实用的美术工艺品。如永春县等地用长节青竹编织竹席、竹枕等，其厚薄和坚韧宛如一张重磅道林纸，经过艺人巧心削劈和编织以后，竟使人找不到竹节痕迹和席子的正反面，所织图案、花纹之对称甚为优美细致。因此人们不仅在日常生活中使用它，同时如古田花篮、永春漆篮等是一种很好的礼物和盛放礼物的用具之一。
    重放光芒的陶瓷
    福建在历史上也是著名的陶瓷美术工艺之乡，如脂似玉、玲珑透光的德化精瓷，淳朴大方、富有民间色彩的长乐黄石陶器等都很有名。解放后经过新老艺人的努力和有关部门的钻研发掘，已将失传数十年的德化精瓷和青花绘瓷重新恢复生产，产品质量和花色品种也正蒸蒸日上，超出了历史上最高水平。素以洁白著称的浮花、贴花瓷器，在衬以金色彩绘等以后，益显其金碧辉煌，细白可爱。著名的长乐黄石陶器中有把壶身配有八宝图案的嵌花酒壶，在参加十多次出国展览中，都被当地的报刊竞相介绍，叹为简朴淳厚、赏心悦目的奇观。
  驰名中外的木偶头
    福建省不仅木偶表演艺术达到高深境界，同时为适应木偶表演而雕造的木偶头也已驰名中外，其中又分为采用梨园戏脸谱的泉州木偶头、采用京戏脸谱的石码木偶头和以揉合汉调和客家调脸谱的漳州木偶头等三大类，再加上艺人们从观察生活中创造出来的新脸型和工艺美术家等雕造的各种人化的动物头，真可谓五花八门，样样俱全。
