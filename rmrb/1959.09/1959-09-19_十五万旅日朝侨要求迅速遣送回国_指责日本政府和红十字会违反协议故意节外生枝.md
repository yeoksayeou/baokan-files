Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th - 150,000 Korean residents in Japan held rallies in more than 210 locations across Japan today, demanding that the Japanese Red Cross Society cancel regulations that violate the agreement on repatriating Korean residents in Japan and swiftly repatriate Korean residents.

In Tokyo, more than 3,300 Koreans unanimously passed a resolution at a rally, firmly demanding that the Japanese Red Cross Society abide by the repatriation agreement and cancel all provisions that violate it. The resolution also demanded that the Japanese Red Cross Society take measures to eliminate the obstruction of the Syngman Rhee clique and cooperate with the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan on repatriation affairs.

The declaration adopted by the rally strongly condemned the Japanese government and the Japanese Red Cross Society for violating humanitarianism and using the issue of repatriating Korean residents as political bargaining chips with US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique.

The declaration firmly stated that Korean residents in Japan would abide by the repatriation agreement and work to ensure the smooth repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

The so-called "Korean Residents Repatriation Affairs Plan" recently issued by the Japanese Red Cross Society stipulates that the Japanese Red Cross Society must "confirm" the "free will" of those wishing to return home; returnees are not allowed to meet guests or travel outside before boarding the ship at Niigata Port; they are not allowed to display the Korean flag before boarding the ship; and it must once again try to "confirm" whether there is any change in the "will to return home" of Korean residents before boarding the ship in Niigata.

Representatives from the Japanese Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the National Railway Workers' Union, and the Japan-Korea Association spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their support for the struggle of Korean residents in Japan to return home.

After the rally, all participants went to the Japanese Red Cross Society and relevant departments of the Japanese government and sent representatives to submit the resolution of the rally.

    十五万旅日朝侨要求迅速遣送回国
    指责日本政府和红十字会违反协议故意节外生枝
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：旅日朝鲜侨民十五万人今天在日本全国二百一十多个地方举行大会，要求日本红十字会取消违反关于遣送旅日朝侨回国协议的规定，迅速遣送朝侨回国。
    在东京，三千三百多名朝鲜人在大会上一致通过决议，坚决要求日本红十字会遵守遣侨协议，取消违背遣侨协议的一切规定。决议还要求日本红十字会采取措施排除李承晚集团的阻碍，并就遣送朝侨回国事务同旅日朝鲜人总联合会进行合作。
    大会通过的宣言，强烈指责日本政府和日本红十字会违背人道主义，把遣送朝侨问题当做同美帝国主义和李承晚集团在政治上讨价还价的资本。
    宣言坚决表示，旅日朝侨将遵守遣侨协议，为顺利使旅日朝侨回国而努力。
    日本红十字会最近发表的所谓“朝鲜侨民遣送事务计划”规定，日本红十字会要“确认”希望归国者的“自由意志”；归国者在到新潟港乘船以前一概不准会客和外游；在乘船以前不准悬挂朝鲜国旗；在新潟乘船以前它要再一次设法“确认”朝侨的“归国意志”有无变更。
    日本共产党、日本工会总评议会、国营铁道工会和日朝协会的代表们在会上讲话，一致表示支持旅日朝侨争取回国的斗争。
    大会结束后，全体与会者到日本红十字会和日本政府各有关部门，并且派代表递交了大会决议。
