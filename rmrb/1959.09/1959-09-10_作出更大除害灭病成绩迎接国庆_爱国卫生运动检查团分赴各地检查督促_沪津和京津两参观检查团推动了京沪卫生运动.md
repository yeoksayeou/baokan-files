Xinhua News Agency report: The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee recently convened a meeting of representatives from relevant units and decided that three inspection groups, composed of responsible personnel and relevant cadres from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Railways, the Health Department of the Military Commission, and the office of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, would go to provinces and cities such as Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Jilin to inspect the progress of the summer and autumn Patriotic Health Campaign.

The inspection groups will focus on inspecting major and medium-sized cities, railway stations, and seaports along the railway lines, so that areas and units that have already basically achieved "four-withouts" (no rats, no flies, no mosquitoes, no bedbugs) can continue to improve the quality of their sanitation work, and areas and units that have not yet achieved basic "four-withouts" will strive to catch up with the advanced, so as to greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day with greater achievements in pest elimination and disease control, clean and tidy.

The inspection groups departed separately on September 6th and 7th and are scheduled to conclude at the end of the month.

Xinhua News Agency report: According to the "Agreement on Eliminating Four Pests, Emphasizing Hygiene, and Eradicating Diseases" among Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the health visiting inspection groups formed by Shanghai and Tianjin, and Beijing and Tianjin, respectively, visited and inspected the autumn Patriotic Health Campaign in Beijing and Shanghai from August 31st to September 6th.

These two visiting inspection groups conducted serious and meticulous inspections of over eighty areas and units in Beijing and one hundred and five areas and units in Shanghai.

The Beijing residential areas, factories, people's communes, government offices, schools, and public places inspected by the visiting inspection groups generally had no mosquitoes or flies. The visiting inspection groups were particularly impressed by the method of using mass movements to vigorously control and treat mosquito and fly breeding conditions. The Jiangjunfen Neighborhood Committee, formerly known as a "bedbug nest," has been transformed into a small garden full of red flowers after the entire population took action, and the original stinking manure field and stinking mud pit are gone. The visiting inspection groups believe that an important experience for Beijing's good sanitation work is the attention paid by the Party Committee. For example, the Party Committee secretaries of units such as the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory and the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory personally took charge and went to the front line in every sanitation assault, taking the lead in conducting sanitation assaults and inspections.

The visiting inspection groups expressed satisfaction with most of the areas and units inspected in Shanghai. These areas and units have clean environments, no mosquitoes or flies, effectively prevent summer and autumn infectious diseases, improve industrial hygiene and labor hygiene, and generally have relatively sound sanitation work systems and clear goals.

The visiting inspection groups have greatly promoted the health campaign in the two cities. In order to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day cleanly, the broad masses of Beijing have expressed their intention to better carry out the third and fourth sanitation assault campaigns before the National Day, and the people of Shanghai will also launch the fourth sanitation assault campaign before September 13th.

    作出更大除害灭病成绩迎接国庆
    爱国卫生运动检查团分赴各地检查督促
    沪津和京津两参观检查团推动了京沪卫生运动
    据新华社讯　中央爱国卫生运动委员会最近召集有关单位的代表开会，决定由全国总工会、共青团中央、全国妇联、卫生部、铁道部、军委卫生部和中央爱国卫生运动委员会办公室等单位负责人员和有关干部组成三个检查团，分赴上海、浙江、江苏、广东、湖南、湖北、辽宁、黑龙江、吉林等省、市，检查夏秋季爱国卫生运动的开展情况。
    检查团将重点检查铁路沿线大中城市、车站和海港，使已经实现基本“四无”的地区和单位继续提高卫生工作的质量，尚未达到基本“四无”的地区和单位争取赶上先进，以更大的除害灭病成绩，干干净净，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    检查团在9月6日、7日分头出发，计划在月底结束。
    据新华社讯　根据京、津、沪三市的“除四害讲卫生消灭疾病协议书”的规定，上海天津两市和北京天津两市所组成的卫生参观检查团，从8月31日至9月6日分别在北京和上海参观检查了秋季爱国卫生运动的情况。
    这两个参观检查团曾分别到北京八十多个地区和单位、上海一百零五个地区和单位进行了认真、细致的检查。
    参观检查团检查过的北京居民区、工厂、人民公社、机关、学校和公共场所，一般都没有发现蚊、蝇。参观检查团印象较深的是用群众运动的方法，来大力控制和处理蚊蝇的孳生条件。过去被称为“臭虫窝”的将军坟居民委员会，经过全民动手，原来的臭粪场和臭泥坑，现已变成红花满园的小花园。参观检查团认为，首都卫生工作搞得好的一条重要经验是党委的重视。如北京电子管厂、北京第一棉纺织厂等单位党委书记亲自挂帅，在每次卫生突击时，都亲赴第一线，带头进行卫生工作的突击和检查。
    参观检查团对检查过的上海绝大部分地区和单位表示满意。这些地区和单位环境整洁，无蚊无蝇，有效地防止夏秋季传染病，改善了工业卫生和劳动卫生，一般都有较健全的卫生工作制度和明确的目标。
    参观检查团对两市的卫生运动起了很大的推动作用。为了干干净净迎接国庆十周年，北京广大群众表示在国庆节前要更好地开展第三、四次卫生突击运动，上海市人民也将于9月13日前展开第四次卫生突击运动。
