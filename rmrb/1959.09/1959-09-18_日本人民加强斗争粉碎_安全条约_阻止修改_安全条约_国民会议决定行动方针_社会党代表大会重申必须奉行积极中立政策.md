Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch: The Second National Representative Conference of the National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was held in Tokyo on the 16th. More than 300 representatives from all prefectures across the country participated in the conference.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution, a current action plan, and an appeal to the people.

The resolution pointed out that joint struggle organizations against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" have now been established in all prefectures and more than 500 cities and towns in Japan. This is a great achievement. The resolution stated that the representatives are determined to consolidate the joint struggle organization when the internal contradictions of the Nobusuke Kishi government deepen, pay attention to uniting farmers, ordinary citizens, women, and public leaders around the national movement, and give heavy blows to the Japanese reactionaries and the United States through large-scale mass movements scheduled for October and November, smash the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Japan-U.S. military alliance, and strive for peace, independence, and neutrality.

The current action plan requires the establishment of joint struggle organizations in all cities and towns before the end of October, and on this basis, to hold discussion meetings on opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and prepare for a general strike.

The plan also stipulates that farmers, urban residents, and public leaders should also establish joint struggle organizations, and mobilize the masses to post two slogans each, demanding that local councils make resolutions against revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The appeal to the people said that people from all walks of life should launch a struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on a larger scale than the movement against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" last autumn, because the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will determine the fate of the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch: Representatives of farmers and workers from neighboring prefectures of Tokyo are successively departing from various places to participate in the "Grand Parade to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and Support the Tokyo District Court's Judgment on the Sunagawa Incident" to be held on the 18th.

This parade will be held in four routes in Tokyo. Then gather in Hibiya Park for a mass rally.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th Dispatch: The 16th National Congress of the Japan Socialist Party today adopted the Socialist Party's movement policy and diplomatic policy for 1959.

The movement policy stipulates: The Socialist Party's action goal this year is: "To defend peace and independence, to defend democracy, to defend life and rights. In order to strive for peace and independence, Japan must get rid of military alliances and establish an active neutral stance. In order to defend democracy, it is necessary to protect democracy on the basis of the constitution, especially to protect parliamentary politics and basic human rights, and it is necessary to expand the struggle to defend democracy. In order to defend the people's lives and rights, it is necessary to implement economic policies based on the demands of the working people, and to explain to the people that the fundamental reason for suppressing the people's lives and rights is the military alliance of the security treaty, and to strengthen the unity of the workers."

The diplomatic policy writes: "The policy of strength is outdated. To enhance Japan's international status, it is necessary to pursue the active neutral diplomatic policy advocated by the Socialist Party, that is, not to participate in any military alliances, not to participate in the Cold War, to strive to ease international conflicts, and to coexist peacefully with all countries." The diplomatic policy also writes: Japan's urgent task is to change the government and ruling party's current diplomatic policy of strengthening the military alliance with the United States and intensifying Japan's hostility towards China and the Soviet Union, and the only feasible way is to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and restore diplomatic relations with China.

The conference also adopted a movement policy on opposing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." It said: "The struggle against the revision of the Security Treaty is the Socialist Party's biggest struggle this year. All other people's movements must be linked to this struggle."

The policy also writes: It is necessary to combine mass struggle with parliamentary struggle, and strive to dissolve the parliament and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government. The statement issued by the Socialist Party today emphasizes the need to move in the direction of preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The conference also adopted a policy on restoring Japan-China relations. The policy stipulates that in September and October, it will promote the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, cooperate with all relevant organizations, develop the movement against the Nobusuke Kishi government, pursue the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's policy of adopting a hostile attitude towards China at the upcoming special session of the Diet, and launch a propaganda campaign to awaken national public opinion.

The conference also adopted a plan for parliamentary struggle and economic policy. (Attached picture)

    社会党代表大会重申必须奉行积极中立政策
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议第二次全国代表大会16日在东京举行。参加大会的有全国各县三百多名代表。
    大会一致通过了决议、当前行动方针和致人民的呼吁书。
    决议指出，现在日本所有的县和五百多个市镇已经建立了反对日美“安全条约”的共同斗争组织。这是一个巨大的成就。决议表示代表们决心要在岸信介政府内部矛盾加深的时候巩固共同斗争组织，注意把农民、普通市民、妇女和公众领袖团结在国民运动周围，通过订于10月和11月进行的大规模的群众运动来给予日本反动势力和美国以沉重的打击，粉碎日美“安全条约”和日美军事同盟，争取和平、独立和中立。
    当前行动方针要求10月底以前在所有的市和镇都建立起共同斗争组织，并在这个基础上举行关于反对日美“安全条约”的讨论会，准备总罢工。
    方针还规定，农民、城市居民和公众领袖也应该成立共同斗争组织，并且发动群众每人贴两张标语，要求地方议会作出反对修改日美“安全条约”的决议。
    致人民的呼吁书说，各阶层人民应该展开规模比去年秋天反对修改“警职法”运动更大的反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争，因为新的日美“安全条约”将决定日本人民的命运。
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：东京邻近各县的农民和工人代表从各地相继出发，前往东京参加将在18日举行的“阻止修改日美安全条约、支持东京地方裁判所对砂川事件的判决大游行”。
    这次游行将在东京市内分为四路举行。然后汇集在日比谷公园举行群众大会。
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本社会党第十六次全国代表大会今天通过了社会党1959年的运动方针和外交方针。
    运动方针规定：社会党今年的行动目标是：“保卫和平和独立，保卫民主，保卫生活和权利。为了争取和平和独立，日本必须摆脱军事联盟，确立积极中立的立场。为了保卫民主，必须在宪法的基础上保护民主，特别是保护议会政治和基本人权，并且必须扩大保卫民主的斗争。为了保卫人民的生活和权利，必须以劳动人民的要求为依据来推行经济政策，并且向人民说明压制人民生活和权利的根本原因是安全条约的军事联盟，并且加强工人的团结力量。”
    外交方针写道：“实力政策已经过时了。要提高日本的国际地位就要奉行社会党提倡的积极中立的外交政策，那就是，不参加任何军事联盟，不参加冷战，争取缓和国际冲突，同一切国家和平共处。”外交方针还写道：日本的迫切任务是改变政府和执政党现行的加强同美国的军事联盟和加剧日本对中苏的敌意的外交政策，其唯一可行的办法是废除日美“安全条约”，恢复同中国的外交关系。
    大会还通过了关于反对修改日美“安全条约”的运动方针。它说：“反对修改安全条约的斗争是社会党今年最大的斗争。所有其他的人民运动都必须同这个斗争联系起来。”
    方针还写道：必须把群众斗争同国会斗争结合起来，争取解散国会和打倒岸信介政府。社会党今天发表的声明，强调要向阻止修改“安全条约”的方向前进。
    大会还通过了关于恢复日中关系的方针。方针规定在9月和10月促进恢复日中外交关系，同一切有关组织合作，发展反对岸信介政府的运动，在即将举行的国会特别会议上追究岸信介内阁对中国采取敌对态度的政策，发动宣传活动唤醒全国舆论。
