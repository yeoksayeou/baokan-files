    I Guarantee to Raise Hogs to Be Fat and Big
    Chen Kai, Feishou Production Brigade Feishou People’s Commune, Chongqing City
    I am a feeder in a production brigade of the Feishou People's Commune in Chongqing. After reading the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Resolution on Launching the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy, I was very happy. These days, we have been thinking about the call in the Communiqué and the Resolution to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in two years, and we are working even harder.
    Our brigade firmly responds to the call of the Communiqué and continues to leap forward on the basis of the victories achieved in the first half of the year, further developing non-staple food production. Within this year, the brigade will develop 2,050 hogs, an average of 50 per household, and transfer 200 fat pigs before the end of the year, and 100 before National Day, as a gift to the Party. In addition, the number of small poultry will be increased to 800, an average of 20 per household, and more than 100 mu of vegetables will be planted to supply the city.
    The new plan proposed by the brigade in response to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee encourages me. I firmly guarantee to further improve feeding work and further improve technology. Before the end of the year, one person will feed more than 300 hogs, an increase from the current 138, and do a good job in the brigade's hog development work, ensuring that few or no additional people are added. Strive to learn business and develop in the direction of an all-rounder, learning the work of hog breeder, epidemic prevention worker, artificial insemination worker, and midwife, etc., so that the pigs grow fat and big.

    我保证把生猪喂得又肥又大
    重庆市木洞人民公社丰收生产大队饲养员  陈凯
    我是重庆市木洞人民公社一个生产大队的饲养员，读了党的八届八中全会公报和关于开展增产节约运动的决议后，非常高兴，这几天我们每时每刻都想到公报和决议中提出两年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的号召，干劲更大。
    我们大队坚决响应公报号召，在上半年取得胜利的基础上继续跃进，进一步发展副食品生产，在年内大队要发展生猪二千零五十头，平均每户五十头，年底前调出肥猪二百头，国庆前调出一百头，向党献礼。另外，小家禽发展到八百只，每户平均二十只，还要增种蔬菜一百多亩，供应城市。
    大队为响应八届八中全会号召提出的新的计划鼓舞着我，我坚决保证进一步改进饲养工作，进一步提高技术，年底前一个人饲养生猪由现在的一百三十八头增加到三百多头，作好大队生猪发展工作，保证少增加或不增加人。努力学习业务，向多面手方向发展，学会猪的饲养员、防疫员、人工受精员、接生员等工作，让猪长得又肥又大。
