Dear Comrades:
    The festival of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a festival after the Great October Socialist Revolution where international imperialism suffered its greatest blow, a festival of glorious revolution. This revolution shook the foundations of imperialism throughout Asia and Africa, therefore it is a festival for all progressive mankind, and also a festival for the people of our Arab countries.
    Chinese comrades, we, the Syrian people and all Arab people, as well as the people of all countries in the world, salute you, and salute the victories you have achieved in the struggle to defend the unity of the motherland against the conspiracies of imperialism and their running dogs in Tibet. We hope that you will continue to achieve victories in order to expel imperialism and their running dogs from Taiwan, realize the complete unification of your country, and at the same time, we join millions of people in demanding that great China occupy its place in the United Nations.
    Since Khrushchev's visit to the United States, the people of all countries in the world have begun to be optimistic about the future of the cause of world peace.
    Comrades: The great achievements you have made in improving the material and cultural living standards of the people, in developing your agriculture and industrializing your country, and the continuous victories in building socialism in a short period of ten years, all point out to the working people of the world how great the power of a people is when led by such a wise leader as the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, and when these people have such strong and loyal friends as the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp.
    Dear comrades: As a Syrian Arab citizen, please allow me, in the name of the Central Committee of the Syrian Communist Party, and in the name of all patriots in our country, to thank the great Chinese people for their continuous support to the Arab people in the most difficult historical moments of the struggle for liberation: in stopping the imperialist conspiracies against Syria, in stopping the three imperialist countries from attacking the Suez Canal, in defending the glorious July 14th Revolution of Iraq, in supporting the heroic Algerian people, and in every stage of the Arab people's struggle against imperialism and Zionism.
    Now, comrades, the Arab East is going through a difficult period. The development of events has shown that the anti-communist movement publicly launched by Nasser at the beginning of this year is nothing but a curtain for a dangerous policy. This policy threatens the important victories that the Arab national liberation movement has achieved in recent years. The attempt to merge Syria and Egypt, the conspiracies used by the ruling group of the United Arab Republic against the Republic of Iraq, the understanding between Nasser and King Saud and King Hussein, opening the door to imperialist capital, and the slanderous attacks against the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries. All of this shows to the people's masses and the broadest patriotic people in the Arab countries that the Egyptian bourgeois monopoly group, under the smoke screen of anti-communism, is actively distorting the slogan of Arab unity, and using this slogan to carry out policies dictated by their narrow, selfish class ambitions. Their policy is to piece together the forces of reactionaries and imperialist agents in the Arab world, split the national movement, stifle democracy, deprive the people of their most basic freedom, reach an understanding with US imperialism, and undermine friendship with the countries of the socialist camp.
    The people of the United Arab Republic are suffering from a terrible dictatorial system, which is using fascist methods against all patriotic and democratic forces. At present, in Egypt and Syria, thousands of patriots, including communists, trade union workers, democrats and young people, are suffering all kinds of barbaric persecution in prisons. Among these patriots is the great Arab citizen, Comrade Farajallah Helou, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lebanese Communist Party, who was abducted by secret service agents.
    The policies implemented by the Egyptian banking group in Syria since the merger with Syria have hit the Syrian economy, causing a decline in industrial and agricultural production, a depression in commerce, widespread unemployment, and rising prices.
    Syria is suffering today from an arbitrary and chaotic system never seen in the modern history of the country.
    Nasser wants to implement in Iraq, Lebanon and other Arab countries everything that is being implemented in Syria today, but this policy is doomed to failure.
    The awakened workers and peasants of Syria and all patriotic forces, like their brothers in all Arab countries, recognize that their greatest enemy is international imperialism headed by US imperialism, and they also recognize that the only path to liberation and victory is to take the path of the national united front in every Arab country, the path of Arab unity against imperialism, the path of democracy, and the path of friendship with the Soviet Union, People's China, and other countries of the great socialist camp.
    Long live the great Chinese people!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the unity of the great socialist camp, the bastion of world peace!
    Long live Chinese-Arab friendship!

### 叙利亚共产党中央委员会总书记、叙利亚共产党代表团团长  巴格达什同志的贺词

    叙利亚共产党中央委员会总书记、叙利亚共产党代表团团长
    巴格达什同志的贺词亲爱的同志们：
    中华人民共和国成立的节日是在伟大的十月社会主义革命之后国际帝国主义遭到最大打击的节日、是一个光荣革命的节日，这次革命动摇了帝国主义在整个亚洲和非洲的基础，因此它是整个进步人类的节日，也是我们阿拉伯国家人民的节日。
    中国同志们，我们叙利亚人民和全体阿拉伯人民以及世界各国人民一样，向你们致敬，向你们为卫护祖国的统一在反对帝国主义和他们在西藏的走狗的阴谋的斗争中所取得的胜利致敬，希望你们继续取得胜利以便把帝国主义和他们的走狗从台湾驱逐出去，实现你们国家的完全统一，与此同时，我们和千百万人民同声要求伟大的中国在联合国中占有它的地位。
    赫鲁晓夫访问美国以后世界各国人民对世界和平事业的前途开始抱着乐观。
    同志们：很短的十年期间，你们在提高人民的物质和文化水平方面，在发展你们的农业和你们国家的工业化方面取得的巨大成就和在建设社会主义中取得的不断胜利，这一切都向全世界劳动人民指出，在一个像中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东这样英明的领导下的人民，在这些人民有着像苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国这样强大而忠诚的朋友的时候，他们的力量是多么巨大。
    亲爱的同志们：我作为一个叙利亚的阿拉伯公民，请允许我以叙利亚共产党中央委员会的名义，以我国所有爱国者的名义，感谢伟大的中国人民在阿拉伯人解放斗争最困难的历史时刻，给予他们不断的支持：在制止帝国主义对叙利亚进行的阴谋、制止三个帝国主义国家进攻苏伊士运河方面，在保卫伊拉克光荣的7月14日革命、支援英雄的阿尔及利亚人民方面，以及在阿拉伯人反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义斗争的每一个阶段中所给予的支持。
    现在，同志们，阿拉伯东方正经历着一个困难时期。事态的发展已经表明，纳赛尔今年年初所公开发动的反共运动，只不过是一个危险政策的幕布。这种政策威胁着阿拉伯民族解放运动在近几年来所取得的重要胜利。叙利亚、埃及合并的尝试，阿联统治集团对伊拉克共和国施用的阴谋，纳赛尔和沙特国王，侯赛因国王之间的谅解，给帝国主义资本打开了方便之门，以及对苏联、人民中国、和其他社会主义国家进行污蔑攻击。这一切都向阿拉伯国家的人民群众和最广大的爱国人士说明了，埃及的资产阶级垄断集团，正在反共产主义的烟幕下，积极地歪曲阿拉伯团结的口号，并利用这个口号来执行他们的狭隘的自私阶级野心所规定的政策。他们的这一政策，是：把阿拉伯世界的反动派和帝国主义代理人的力量拼凑在一起、分裂民族运动、扼杀民主、剥夺人民的最起码的自由、同美帝国主义取得谅解，以及破坏同社会主义阵营各国的友谊。
    阿联人民今天正遭受着恐怖的独裁制度，这种制度正对一切爱国民主力量施用法西斯手段。目前在埃及，叙利亚的监牢里成千的爱国人士、包括共产党人、工会工作者、民主人士和青年，正在遭受着种种野蛮迫害。这些爱国人士中有伟大的阿拉伯公民、黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会书记法尔占拉·赫卢同志，他是被侦缉队特务劫夺走的。
    埃及银行集团自合并叙利亚以来在叙利亚实行的政策打击了叙利亚经济，造成了工农业生产的下降，商业的萧条、普遍的失业和物价的高涨。
    叙利亚今天正遭受着本国现代历史中从来没有见过的专横混乱的制度。
    纳赛尔想在伊拉克，黎巴嫩和其他阿拉伯国家实行今天在叙利亚所实行的这一切，但是这种政策注定是要失败的。
    叙利亚的觉悟了的工人农民和一切爱国力量像所有阿拉伯国家的弟兄们一样，都认识到他们的最大敌人是以美帝国主义者为首的国际帝国主义，同时也认识到他们走向解放和胜利的唯一道路是在每一个阿拉伯国家走民族统一战线的道路，是反对帝国主义的阿拉伯团结的道路，是民主的道路，是同苏联、人民中国和伟大的社会主义阵营其他各国友好的道路。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    世界和平的堡垒伟大的社会主义阵营的团结万岁！
    中国阿拉伯友好万岁！（附图片）
