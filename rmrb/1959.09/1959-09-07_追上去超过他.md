Before dawn, a young man rushed towards the Daxi Gou wharf on the Jialing River in Chongqing, taking three steps at a time and oblivious to everything else. The small ferry to cross the river had not yet arrived. The young man was very anxious. He thought he could get back to the workshop early and work hard, but the surging river blocked his way.

The young man blamed himself for oversleeping; in fact, he hardly slept all night. Last night, at the broadcast rally listened to by 600,000 workers in the city, he and Liao Shigang, a well-known innovator in Chongqing, challenged each other and revised the conditions for their competition. Both sides expressed their determination to create excellent results on the first day of the competition. This was the night before the fierce battle, and the two spent time after the meeting exchanging experiences and further researching each other to make their plans advanced and reliable. These two competitors are close in age, from neighboring villages, entered the factory in the same year and month, and both joined the Party in 1956. Liao Shigang is dark-skinned, calm, and experienced. Wei Gaohou is fair-skinned and looks energetic and active. Liao Shigang was already famous in 1954 for managing eight machine tools alone. Wei Gaohou is also a remarkable expert who emerged during the Great Leap Forward. Like Liao Shigang, he averages more than one innovation proposal per day. These two old friends are both milling workers, one in the Construction Machine Tool Factory and the other in the Chang'an Machine Factory, facing each other across the river. They originally proposed conditions to each other to conduct a competition. After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, in order to respond to the call to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year, the two simultaneously thought that the competition targets should be raised. Now, their final revised plans are to complete the tasks for the last four months of this year in twenty days, realize more than 300 innovation proposals, and also help the masses improve their technical level and realize innovation proposals.

After exchanging experiences, Wei Gaohou actually delayed his time to cross the river. He had to spend the night in the city. How could he sleep that night? He carefully read the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee again. He thought that he was just a worker who could not get enough to eat or wear and pulled a rickshaw. In the ten years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, he had turned himself over, improved his skills and culture. Thinking of these things, he was even more excited and couldn't sleep.

Waiting, waiting, the small ferry finally arrived. Wei Gaohou crossed the river and rushed to the workshop like an unbridled horse. At this time, the night shift workers were still fighting intensely. Wei Gaohou couldn't wait and immediately found the Party branch secretary to report his plans. The branch secretary immediately supported him.

The workshop was adjusting machine tools, and Wei Gaohou's lathe needed to be installed. The branch secretary and the workshop director personally took the lead in helping him move the machine tool. Workers who arrived to take over the shift one after another, heard that Wei Gaohou was officially starting the competition with Liao Shigang today, and came to help. More than 30 people, in one go, carried a milling machine weighing six tons into the workshop like carrying a bridal sedan chair.

While busy installing the machine with his comrades, Wei Gaohou looked around to see if other comrades had any difficulties in production that needed help. His eyes suddenly fell on the foot of the workshop wall, where a pile of dark neck ring blanks were placed. The section chief, Hu Farong, told Wei Gaohou with some distress: "This work is extremely slow. It takes 30 minutes to process one, and it looks like it will affect the workshop's early completion of the task." Wei Gaohou was not concerned before he heard it, but after hearing it, he became as anxious as the section chief and immediately agreed to help him solve this difficulty. Then, his eyes fell on another machine tool nearby. He saw that there was a hole in the middle of a fixture on this machine tool and thought that if he could make a core of more than a foot long to connect the neck rings for processing, wouldn't it improve efficiency? He told his ideas to the section chief and the experienced masters around him. According to Wei Gaohou's suggestion, after improvement, 20 pieces were milled out in one hour, increasing work efficiency tenfold, and the quality was better than that processed by the old method.

After the machine tool was installed, the first batch of products Wei Gaohou processed was the backing plate for the round car head. However, the machine had just been installed, and the cement at the base had not yet dried, so it could not be put into production immediately. Seeing that he couldn't use his strength, he was really a little annoyed. He found several masters in the same group to study. After improvement, the task that originally required five and a half days to complete was completed in only four hours.

On this day, at the Construction Machine Tool Factory, Liao Shigang also arrived at the workshop early. After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee were published, he couldn't suppress the excitement in his heart for several days. He seemed to be running instead of walking. The workers described him as: "Really like a tiger with wings, this person is very energetic!"

Liao Shigang proposed that he would realize ten innovation projects on the first day of the competition; but it was almost 3:00 PM, and although he had also realized five innovation proposals, what about the others? He still had to find clues. He suddenly ran and rushed to the workshop again. It turned out that he had come up with a method to improve the processing of a part, changing the round car thread cutting to milling car thread cutting, which could greatly improve work efficiency. He was busy looking for wrenches and knives, and his partners who volunteered to support him scrambled to help him find this and that, reducing his auxiliary labor time and enabling him to realize this innovation project faster. The Party and Youth League organizations tried to support him in various ways; the suggestions he put forward were immediately organized to help him realize them.

In this way, Liao Shigang put forward a total of eleven suggestions on this day and realized ten of them, fulfilling his plan.

On this day, the young men in Liao Shigang's youth work area chased after each other, and 80% of them exceeded the shift production quota, and the quality was completely qualified.

The next morning, when the good news that Liao Shigang had overfulfilled the first day's production plan and realized ten innovation suggestions came across the river, Wei Gaohou's newly installed car was spinning at a high speed of 750 revolutions.

On this day, Liao Shigang happily received the good news from Wei Gaohou again: he completed 4,690 minutes of processing tasks on the same day, and put forward 25 innovation suggestions in two days, realizing seven of them. Wei Gaohou's group completed the August production plan three and a half days ahead of schedule.

On the same day, Liao Shigang overfulfilled the day's production plan by another 1,000 pieces.

    追上去超过他
    本报记者　平兰、素芬
    天蒙蒙亮，一个年青小伙子三步并作两步，什么也不顾地直奔重庆嘉陵江边的大溪沟码头。这时，
  过江的小火轮还没有开过来。小伙子十分焦急，眼看对面就是自己的工厂，满以为起个早赶回车间可以大干一番，可是滔滔江水却拦住了去路。
    小伙子埋怨自己睡得过久了；其实他一夜简直没有睡着。昨晚，在全市六十万职工收听的广播大会上，他和重庆鼎鼎大名的革新能手廖世刚互相挑战，新修订了他们开展对手赛的条件，双方都表示决心要在竞赛的第一天创造优异的成绩。这是激战前的一夜，两人都在会后抓紧时间交流了经验，并进一步相互研究，使计划既先进又可靠。这两个竞赛对手年龄相近，家乡毗邻，同年同月进厂，又同是1956年入党。黑黑的脸，沉静、老练的是廖世刚。白净面孔，显出紧绷绷一副活跃的姿态的是魏高厚。廖世刚早在1954年就以一人管理八台机床而闻名。魏高厚也是大跃进中涌现出来的一个引人注目的能手。他和廖世刚一样，平均每天就要实现革新建议一件以上。这两个老朋友同是铣工，一个在建设机床厂，一个在长安机器厂，隔江相望，他们原来就彼此提出条件，开展对手赛。当党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，为了响应提前在今年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的号召，两人又同时想起，竞赛指标还要提高。现在，他们最后修订的计划，都是以二十天的时间完成今年后四个月的任务，实现革新建议三百项以上，还要帮助群众提高技术水平，实现革新建议。
    在交流了经验以后，魏高厚竟把过江的时间耽误了。他只好在城里宿了一夜。这一夜他哪里睡得着呢？他又把八届八中全会公报和决议仔细读了一遍，想起自己原来不过是一个穿不暖、吃不饱拉黄包车的工人，解放十年来，在党的领导下自己翻了身，提高了技术、文化，想起这些，更是兴奋得睡不着。
    等着，等着，好容易小火轮过来了。魏高厚渡过江，像一匹勒不住的骏马，飞奔车间。这时，夜班工人还在紧张地战斗着。魏高厚迫不及待，马上找到了党支部书记，汇报了自己的打算。支部书记立即支持他。
    车间里正在调整机床，魏高厚的车床需要安装。支部书记、车间主任亲自带头帮他搬机床。陆续赶来接班的工人，听说魏高厚今天和廖世刚正式开始竞赛，也来帮忙。三十多个人，一鼓作气，把一座重达六吨的铣床像抬花轿一样地搬进车间。
    魏高厚一边忙着和同志们安装机器，一边举目四望，看别的同志在生产中有无困难需要帮助。目光忽然落在车间墙脚下，一堆黑沉沉的颈圈毛胚放在那里，工段长胡法荣有些苦恼地告诉魏高厚：“这个活干起来慢极啦，三十分钟才加工一个，眼看要影响车间提前完成任务。”魏高厚不听犹可，听了后马上和工段长一样着急，便一口答应，帮助他解决这个困难。接着，他眼光又落到邻近的另一部机床上，看见这部机床上的一种夹具中间有孔，想到如能做个一尺多长的心子，把颈圈串连起来加工，不就能提高效率吗？他将自己的想法告诉工段长和身边的老师傅，他们按照魏高厚的建议，加以改进后，一小时内就铣出二十个，提高了工效十倍，质量比用老办法加工的还好。
    机床安好后，魏高厚第一批加工的生活是铣元车头的垫板。但是，机器才安装好，座底的水泥还没干，不能立即投入生产。眼看有劲使不上，真是有点恼火。他找来了同小组的几位师傅来研究。经过改进以后，原来需要五天半才能完成的任务，只需四个钟头就做完了。
    这一天，在建设机床厂，廖世刚也提前来到车间。八届八中全会公报和决议发表后，几天来，他都压抑不住心头的激动。他走路好像不是在走，而是在跑；工人们形容说：“硬是像猛虎插双翅，这个人劲头大得很罗！”
    廖世刚提出他在竞赛的第一天里要实现十项革新项目；可是快到下午三点钟了，他虽然也实现了五件革新建议，但其他的呢？还要现找线索。他猛然又连跑带奔地冲到车间去了。原来他已想出了改进一项零件加工的方法，把元车切丝改为铣车切丝，可以大大提高工效。他忙着找扳手，找刀子，自愿去支援他的伙伴们都笑眯眯地抢着帮他找这找那，减少他的辅助劳动时间，使他更快地实现了这项革新项目。党、团组织更是从各方面设法支持他；他提出的建议，马上组织人力帮他实现。
    就这样，廖世刚这一天共提出十一项建议，就实现了十项，兑现了他的计划。
    这天，廖世刚所在的青年工区早班的小伙子们围绕他你追我赶，有80％的人都超过了班产定额，质量完全合格。
    第二天清晨，当廖世刚超额完成头一天生产计划、实现十项革新建议的喜讯隔河传来的时候，魏高厚新安装好的车子正在以七百五十转的高速度飞速旋转。
    这一天，廖世刚又高兴地获得了魏高厚的喜讯：当天完成了四千六百九十分钟的加工任务，两天来共提革新建议二十五项，实现七项。魏高厚所在的小组提前三天半完成8月份生产计划。
    同一天，廖世刚又超额一千件，完成了当天生产计划。
