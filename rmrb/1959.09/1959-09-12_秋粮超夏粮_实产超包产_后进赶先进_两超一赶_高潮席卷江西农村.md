Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, September 11th: The resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have pushed the "Two Exceeds and One Catch-Up" competition movement of autumn grain exceeding summer grain, actual yield exceeding contracted yield, and latecomers catching up with advanced in Jiangxi's rural areas to a new peak. Currently, people's communes and a large number of production teams in more than eighty counties across the province have all joined the competition movement. While working hard, the people's commune members in various places are also studying and discussing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, analyzing favorable situations, and revising super-production targets, determined to respond to the Party's call with even greater super-production achievements.

The super-production competition movement in Jiangxi Province gradually unfolded after the late rice was transplanted. Yichun County in Yichun Special District took the lead, challenging all counties in the district with the conditions of "ensuring increased production in drought, guaranteeing bumper harvests without rain, eliminating pests and diseases, overcoming the heading stage, and standardizing all rice seedlings in the county as first-class." As soon as the challenge was issued, Wanzai County in the special district responded by stating its goal to complete the grain, cotton, and oil production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year. Subsequently, more than ten counties including Pingxiang, Fengcheng, and Gaoan successively put forward challenges and responses. Super-production competitions also unfolded between people's communes and production teams in various counties. After the announcement of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party, the enthusiasm of the vast cadres and commune members was even higher. Now, a new upsurge of the super-production competition has emerged throughout the special district, with 100,000 cadres joining the battle and millions of commune members working hard. After the Gangkou Commune in Jiujiang City, Jiujiang Special District, proposed a competition to eight brother communes in the city's suburbs, each commune immediately sent back response forms: "Overthrow the Dragon King, eliminate pests and diseases, we must make late rice exceed early rice!" More than twenty counties and three hundred people's communes in Gannan Administrative District and Shangrao Special District have all issued challenge letters and submitted response forms to each other, and the super-production competition is in full swing. Fuzhou Special District, which won the province's first place in grain production last year, while launching competitions between counties, communes, and teams, more than 4,000 agricultural activists proposed to the farmers of the entire district to boost their morale and strive to win the province's grain production championship again. After the proposal was issued, they worked together with millions of commune members in the district to overcome difficulties and lead the masses in making great efforts to compete for super-production.

In order to ensure the completion of the super-production competition targets between counties, communes, and teams, the people's commune members throughout the province put forward the fighting slogan of "winning red flags, becoming pacesetters, everyone striving to be upstream, and everyone catching up with the advanced." A vigorous red flag competition was launched between commune members within their respective units. Seven hundred thousand commune members in Gannan Administrative District launched opponent competitions with each other, setting up camps in the fields and fighting tensely, and the progress of field management in the entire district accelerated by one time compared to the previous period. In Zixi County, Fuzhou Special District, more than 40,000 commune members in each commune were all involved in the competition movement of "one hundred red flags, three thousand pacesetters, and one thousand skilled sisters." In order to compete for red flags and become pacesetters, commune members were all full of fighting spirit, working hard and skillfully, and the labor attendance rate and work efficiency rapidly increased. Opponent competitions among commune members in Yichun Special District were even more surging, and many fathers and sons, husbands and wives, brothers, sisters-in-law, and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law also launched competitions. Xiong Xuefu and Xiong Xueli, two brothers of Lianwei Commune in Nanchang County, signed a competition contract to compare attendance and work efficiency, and launched a competition to exceed labor quotas. After commune member Wu Chengxi and his wife Chen Juzi launched a competition, they chased each other in field management, refusing to give way to each other, and were determined to contribute to the team's super-production. At a recent evaluation meeting held by the commune, they were rated as model production husband and wife, becoming a good story in the competition.

In the super-production competition movement, leading cadres at all levels in Jiangxi went deep into the fields, participated in labor, and led the movement, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the commune members. The eight secretaries of the Xiaohuang Commune Party Committee in Dongxiang County, Shangrao Special District, were divided into five combat groups, leading 320 commune and team cadres respectively, erecting twenty-eight thatched sheds next to the low-yield fields, and eating, living, and working with the commune members, together processing supplementary fertilizer. After ten days of hard work, more than 1,000 mu of low-yield fields were transformed. In Le'an County, Fuzhou Special District, a total of 4,000 cadres at five levels from the county party secretary to the production team leader implemented a field mass meeting, went deep into the front lines, and led the commune members to work hard and skillfully together to strengthen the field management of late rice. Nie Guoqian, the party branch secretary of the Changluo Brigade in the Gongfang Commune, personally led more than 80 commune members to go up the mountain to burn fire ash and go down to the water to carry pond mud to rush to accumulate fertilizer and topdressing for more than 900 mu of third-class rice. After nine days of combat, all 900 mu of third-class rice were upgraded.

The development of the "Two Exceeds and One Catch-Up" competition movement has promoted the rapid progress of autumn field management in Jiangxi. To date, the province has accumulated more than 470 million dan of fertilizer, with an average of 40 dan of topdressing fertilizer available for each mu of late rice field; 2.9 million mu of drought-affected crops have all been irrigated and freed from drought; 1.78 million mu of insect-affected crops have been prevented and controlled mu by mu; and all late rice has undergone two harrowings and two topdressings, of which half of the fields have undergone three harrowings and three topdressings. Due to careful cultivation and management, the area of third-class late rice in the province has dropped from 25% of the total area in the previous period to 15%, and the rice seedlings are generally growing healthily. In addition, cotton, soybeans, sweet potatoes, late sesame and other miscellaneous grain crops are also growing well.

    秋粮超夏粮　实产超包产　后进赶先进
    “两超一赶”高潮席卷江西农村
    新华社南昌11日电　党的八届八中全会的决议，把江西农村秋粮超夏粮、实产超包产和后进赶先进的“两超一赶”竞赛运动推向了新的高峰。现在，全省八十多个县的人民公社和大批生产队全部投入了竞赛运动。各地人民公社社员一面大干特干，一面学习和讨论八中全会的决议，分析有利形势，修订超产指标，决心用更大的超产成就，响应党的号召。
    江西省的超产竞赛运动，在晚稻插完以后就陆续展开了。宜春专区的宜春县一马当先，以“天旱保增产，无雨保丰收，消灭病虫害，攻破抽穗关，全县禾苗一类化”为条件，向全区各县挑战，战表一出，这个专区的万载县就以今年完成第二个五年计划的粮食、棉花和油料生产指标为条件，起而应战，接着萍乡、丰城、高安等十余县纷纷提出了应战、挑战。各县人民公社和生产队之间也展开了超产竞赛。党的八中全会决议公布后，广大干部、社员干劲更加高涨，现在全专区已经出现了十万干部上阵、百万社员奋战的超产竞赛新高潮。九江专区九江市港口公社向全市郊区八个兄弟公社倡议竞赛之后，各公社立刻送回了应战表：斗倒龙王爷，消灭病虫害，定要晚稻超早稻！”赣南行政区、上饶专区二十多个县和三百多个人民公社之间都互相下了挑战书，递了应战表，超产竞赛热火朝天。去年获得全省粮食丰产第一名的抚州专区，在展开县、社、队间竞赛的同时，四千多名农业积极分子向全区农民倡议，鼓足干劲，再夺全省粮食丰产冠军。倡议书发出后他们与全区百万社员同谋共断，战胜困难，带领群众大闹竞赛争超产。
    为了保证完成县、社、队间的超产竞赛指标，全省人民公社社员提出了“夺红旗、当标兵，人人争上游、个个赶先进”的战斗口号。在本单位内社员与社员间展开了轰轰烈烈的红旗竞赛。赣南行政区七十万名社员相互开展了对手赛，在田间扎营摆阵，紧张奋战，全区田间管理进度比前期加快了一倍。抚州专区资溪县各公社四万多名社员全部投入了“百面红旗、三千名标兵、千名巧姐妹”的竞赛运动。社员们为了争红旗、当标兵，人人斗志昂扬，个个苦干巧干，劳动出勤率和工效迅速提高。宜春专区各人民公社社员对手赛更是风起云涌，许多父子、夫妻、兄弟、姑嫂、婆媳之间也展开了竞赛。南昌县联圩公社社员熊学富与熊学礼两兄弟签订了比出勤、比工效的竞赛合同，展开了争超劳动定额的竞赛。社员吴成西与爱人陈菊仔开展竞赛后，在田间管理上，你追我赶，互不相让，都决心对本队超产作出贡献。在最近公社举行的一次评比会上，他们被评为夫妻生产标兵，成为竞赛佳话。
    在超产竞赛运动中，江西各级领导干部深入田间，参加劳动，领导运动，大大鼓舞了社员的干劲。上饶专区东乡县小璜公社党委八个书记分成五个战斗小组，分别带领三百二十名社、队干部，在低产田旁架起二十八个茅棚，和社员同吃同住同劳动，一道加工补肥，经过十天奋战，改造了一千多亩低产田。抚州专区乐安县从县委书记到生产小组组长五级干部共四千人，实行田间大会师，深入阵地带领社员一同苦干巧干，加强晚稻田间管理。供坊公社长罗大队有九百多亩三类禾，大队党支部书记聂国迁亲自带领八十多个社员上山烧火土灰，下水挑塘泥，突击积肥追肥。经过九天战斗，使九百亩三类禾全部升了级。
    “两超一赶”竞赛运动的开展，促使江西秋田管理工作突飞猛进。至今，全省已积肥四亿七千多万担，平均每亩晚稻田可有追肥四十担；二百九十万亩受旱农作物已全部得到了水利灌溉，摆脱了干旱；一百七十八万亩遭受虫害的农作物，亩亩进行了防治；全部晚稻都已经过了二耘二追肥，其中半数田已进行了三耘三追肥。由于精工培育管理，全省晚稻三类禾面积已由前期占总面积25％下降到15％，禾苗普遍生长健壮。此外，棉花和大豆、甘薯、晚芝麻等杂粮作物也生长良好。
