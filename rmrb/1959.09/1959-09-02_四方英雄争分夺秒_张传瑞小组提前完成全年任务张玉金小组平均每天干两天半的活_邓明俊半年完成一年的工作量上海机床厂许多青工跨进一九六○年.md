Our JINAN Dispatch, September 1st. The Zhang Chuanrui Youth Fast Tunneling Team of the Yucun Coal Mine under the Shandong Xinwen Mining Bureau, which was once rewarded by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, has won successive victories in the large-scale bumper harvest competition. As of August 8, it had overfulfilled the annual plan of tunneling 316.84 meters, with excellent project quality and long-term safe production.

The tunneling team consists of 15 people. Except for the team leader Zhang Chuanrui, who arrived at the mine in 1957, the others were new workers who arrived at the mine in the fourth quarter of last year. While strengthening political and ideological education for the new workers, the Party branch adopted methods such as early workers leading late workers, lecturing on knowledge above ground and practicing it underground, so that the new workers quickly improved their ideological and technical levels. The team actively promoted advanced operation methods such as "five-hole center double-groove" and "shallow-hole multi-cycle," which increased the shift progress from about one meter to more than two meters. However, after the implementation of these operation methods, the labor became more intensive, and the work of excavation, loading, transportation, and support could not keep up. Therefore, they promoted advanced experiences such as "semi-automatic rock loading machine," "multi-task parallel cross-operation," "segmented relay transportation," and "fast support," achieving innovation in every process and comprehensively improving the production level.

Our NANCHANG Dispatch, September 1st. Deng Mingjun, a fourth-grade vehicle management worker at the Hongdu Machinery Factory in Jiangxi Province, has a high level of awareness, great enthusiasm, and works skillfully. After completing six years and nine months of work in the four years from 1955 to 1958, he completed twelve months of work in the first half of this year. In total, he completed seven years and nine months of work in four and a half years, and has not produced a single defective product, thus becoming a high-quality and high-yield red banner in Jiangxi Province.

In order to ensure product quality, Deng Mingjun strictly abides by process discipline and various systems, and is careful and meticulous in production. Whenever he receives a task, he first carefully looks at the drawings, carefully checks the dimensions, studies the processing requirements, and checks whether the equipment meets the needs. He carefully checks the sub-parts sent from the outer workshop, and only assembles them after confirming that there are no faults. If there is anything unclear or doubtful, he immediately asks the process engineer for clarification, and never acts carelessly.

In order to achieve high quality, high yield, and overall leap forward, Deng Mingjun actively carries out technological innovation. Over the past four years, he has improved more than 50 kinds of tools, generally increasing work efficiency by two to five times, and up to more than twelve times. For example, in the past, the conduit tie rod was knocked with a hammer for a period of time, which was not only inefficient, but also often caused failures and many defective products. He worked hard to develop a soil spinning die and put it on the machine tool for processing, and the product quality reached 100%, and the work efficiency increased tenfold.

Our Luda Dispatch, September 1st. The Red Flag Group of Dalian Shipyard, the Zhang Yujin Forging Group in Luda City, Liaoning Province, has consistently maintained a strong work enthusiasm, and the Red Flag of high yield and high quality is raised higher and higher. In the first half of the year, the entire group completed more than twenty months of work on the basis of high quality; Since July, the work quota has been increased by 22% compared with the past, but they still try to do an average of one and a half days of work per day; Entering August, the weather was extremely hot, and the entire group of workers, under the slogan of "offering a generous gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day," mustered even greater enthusiasm and completed an average of two and a half days of work per day, creating an unprecedented high-yield record. Their forging quality has always maintained 100% excellence.

The production organization of this group is very tight. They arrange work plans well, prepare all the materials needed for the day in advance according to the drawings, and pile them next to the heating furnace according to the processing sequence and different specifications, so that production is not delayed due to waiting for materials. The old worker Song Jianqing is responsible for tool management. He calculates in advance how many kinds of work he does in a day and how many kinds of tools he uses, and places the tools in a complete and handy place.

The Zhang Yujin Group is also constantly innovating technology. In the first half of this year alone, they created more than 20 kinds of new tools; In July, they put forward six innovation suggestions, and five of them have now been realized, increasing the efficiency of a variety of forging work by more than double.

Our Dispatch. Many young workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant are running ahead of time. From the beginning of the year to the present, according to statistics from only four workshops such as hydraulic, cast wood, there have been 35 young people who have completed the whole year's workload ahead of schedule and entered 1960.

Finding gaps, catching up with the advanced, and striving for the top at all times are important reasons why these young men can march forward vigorously and continuously. The young lathe operators Lu Hongchao, Wang Minghao, and Wang Zhengming of the seventh group of the hydraulic workshop, constantly learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. Although they operate an "old" machine tool, they are among the top in the same type of competition every month. They have also become the object of pursuit by the entire workshop, and currently four or five machine tools have approached their level.

The main means for the young people of this factory to complete the national plan ahead of schedule is technological innovation. For example, the young fitter Wu Zhaogeng specializes in processing various springs on the grinder. With the help of the master, he made a major technical innovation, turning manual operation into mechanical and electrical operation, and increasing production efficiency by one to two hundred times.

    四方英雄争分夺秒
    张传瑞小组提前完成全年任务张玉金小组平均每天干两天半的活
    邓明俊半年完成一年的工作量上海机床厂许多青工跨进一九六○年
    本报济南1日电　曾经获得共青团中央奖励的山东新汶矿务局禹村煤矿青年快速掘进队张传瑞小组，在大面积丰产竞赛运动中连战连捷。截至8月8日已超额完成全年掘进三百一十六点八四米的计划，工程质量良好，并做到了长期安全生产。
    这个掘进组共十五人，除组长张传瑞是1957年到矿以外，别人都是去年第四季度先后到矿的新工人。党支部在对新工人加强政治思想教育的同时，采取早来工人带晚来工人、井上讲知识井下实际练等办法，使新工人迅速提高了思想水平和技术水平。这个小组积极推广了“五股穿心双掏槽”和“浅眼多循环”等先进操作法，使班进度由一米左右提高到二米多。但是，推行这些操作法以后，劳动比较紧张，扒装、运搬、支架等工作跟不上。他们于是又推广了“半自动化装岩机”、“多工种平行交叉作业”、“分段接力运输”、“快速支架”等先进经验，做到了道道工序有革新，全面提高了生产水平。
    本报南昌1日电　江西省洪都机械厂四级车管工人邓明俊觉悟高，干劲大，干得巧，继1955年到1958年四年完成六年零九个月的工作量之后，今年上半年又完成了十二个月的工作任务。总共在四年半内，完成了七年零九个月的工作量，并且没有出过一次废品，因此成为江西省的一面优质高产红旗。
    为了保证产品质量，邓明俊严格遵守工艺纪律和各项制度，生产中认真仔细。每当他接到任务以后，首先细心看图纸，认真复查尺寸，研究加工要求，检查设备是否合乎需要。外车间送来的副件，他都细心检查，确认无故障后才进行装配。有一点不清楚的地方或怀疑的地方，马上向工艺员问清楚，决不马虎动手。
    为了达到优质高产全面跃进，邓明俊积极革新技术。四年多来，经他改进的工具有五十多种，工效一般提高二至五倍，最高达十二倍以上。例如，导管拉杆过去一个时期是用鎯头敲，不仅工效低，而且经常出故障，废品多。他刻苦钻研，制出土旋压模放在机床上加工，产品质量达到了100％，工效提高了十倍。
    本报旅大1日电　辽宁省旅大市的红旗小组——大连造船厂张玉金锻工小组，一贯保持着旺盛的劳动热情，高产优质的红旗越举越高。上半年全组在优质的基础上，完成了二十多个月的工作量；7月开始，工作定额比过去提高了22％，他们仍设法作到平均每天干一天半的活；进入8月，天气酷热，全组工人在“向国庆十周年献份厚礼”的口号下，鼓起更大干劲，平均每天都干完两天半的工作量，创造了空前的高产纪录。他们的锻造质量，一直保持100％的优良。
    这个小组的生产组织工作很严密。他们很好地安排作业计划，根据图纸提前准备好全天需要的材料，按照加工次序和不同规格堆放在加热炉旁，生产中不因等材料而耽误时间。老工人宋建卿负责工具管理，一天干多少种活，用多少种工具，他都事先计算好，把工具齐全地摆在顺手的地方。
    张玉金小组还不断革新技术。今年上半年，他们就创造了二十多种新工具；7月份又提出了六项革新建议，现在已实现了五项，在多种锻活上提高效率一倍多。
    本报讯　上海机床厂许多青年工人跑在时间前面。从年初到现在，仅液压、铸木等四个车间的统计，就有三十五个青年提前完成了今年全年的工作量，跨进了1960年。
    找差距，赶先进，时时争上游，这是小伙子们能够高歌猛进、不断跃进的重要原因。液压车间第七小组的青年车工吕洪潮、王明浩和王正明，不断地学先进，赶先进，虽然他们操作的是一部“老爷”机床，但在同工种竞赛中他们却是月月名列前茅。他们又成为全车间的追赶对象，目前已有四、五台机床接近了他们的水平。
    这个厂的青年们提前完成国家计划的主要手段是革新技术。如青年钳工吴兆庚，专门加工磨床上的各种弹簧，他在老师傅帮助下大闹技术革新，使手工操作变为机械、电气操作，生产效率提高了一倍到二百倍。（附图片）
