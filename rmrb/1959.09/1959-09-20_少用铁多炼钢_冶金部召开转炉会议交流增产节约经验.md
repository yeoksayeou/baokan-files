Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held a national on-site meeting in Shanghai on converter savings in pig iron. The meeting pointed out that if every ton of steel produced by converters nationwide saves 200 kilograms of pig iron, based on the current output, more than 3,000 tons of pig iron can be saved every day. This huge savings target can be achieved in a relatively short period of time by seriously promoting the advanced steelmaking experiences of Shanghai, Qingdao, Tangshan and other places.

The characteristics of converter steelmaking are: low investment, fast construction, high output, and the ability to use high-sulfur pig iron to make steel. After breaking through the technical barrier of using local iron to make good steel last year and this year, converters have rapidly grown into a strong force on the iron and steel front. The output of converter steel has increased from 14.9% of the country's steel output in 1957 to 32% of the total steel output this year, playing a pivotal role in ensuring the early completion of the 12 million-ton steel task. Especially in terms of saving pig iron, due to uneven production technology levels, the potential for savings is significant.

The meeting focused on introducing the advanced experiences of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6, Qingdao Shengjian Machinery Plant, and Tangshan Steel Plant in saving pig iron. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 is a national red flag for high-yield, high-quality, and low-consumption converter steelmaking. Its main experiences in reducing iron consumption are: controlling the chemical composition of molten iron by improving stockyard management; increasing the temperature of molten iron in the iron smelting furnace and improving converter operation to eliminate post-blowing; and launching a labor competition to save pig iron and other auxiliary materials to ensure the implementation of various advanced experiences. The experience of Qingdao Shengjian Machinery Plant is: strictly implement operating procedures, change the acidic iron smelting furnace to a hot air alkaline iron smelting furnace, improve the desulfurization efficiency of the iron smelting furnace, reduce the number of slagging, and shorten the blowing time. The main experience of Tangshan Steel Plant is: using an acidic iron smelting furnace to create alkaline slag for desulfurization, so that the iron smelting furnace, which originally increased sulfur, became an iron smelting furnace that desulfurized by 20% to 40%.

Because these three factories earnestly mobilized the masses, implemented operating procedures, and adopted some necessary technical measures, they generally achieved higher steel production and quality and lower pig iron consumption. Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 has focused on improving quality, with a qualification rate of around 98%, and pig iron consumption per ton of steel has remained stable below 1,300 kilograms. Tangshan Steel Plant's No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop used high-sulfur pig iron to make steel. When various advanced experiences were not implemented in production in April, the steel qualification rate was only 85.3%, and iron consumption per ton of steel reached 1,632 kilograms. After improving various operations from May, the steel qualification rate immediately increased, and iron consumption decreased month by month. By the beginning of September, the qualification rate had increased to 99.9%, and iron consumption had decreased to 1,236 kilograms.

After discussion and on-site visits to Shanghai Steel Plants No. 6 and No. 3, the representatives attending the meeting unanimously believed that the experiences of the advanced factories introduced at the meeting were very valuable and worthy of widespread promotion.

    少用铁多炼钢
    冶金部召开转炉会议交流增产节约经验
    新华社上海18日电　冶金工业部最近在上海召开了全国转炉节约生铁现场会议。会议指出：全国转炉只要每炼一吨钢节约生铁二百公斤，以目前产量计算，每天就可以节约生铁三千多吨；而这个巨大的节约指标，只要认真推广上海、青岛、唐山等地的先进炼钢经验，在不太长的时间内就有可能实现。
    转炉炼钢的特点是：投资少，建设快，产量高，能用高硫生铁炼钢。经过去年和今年突破了用土铁炼好钢的技术关以后，转炉已迅速地成长为钢铁战线上一支强大的生力军，转炉钢的产量从1957年占全国钢产量14.9％，上升到今年占全部钢产量的32％，在保证提前完成一千二百万吨钢的任务中，占有举足轻重的地位。尤其在节约生铁方面，由于生产技术水平不一，节约的潜力很大。
    会议着重介绍了上钢六厂、青岛市生建机械厂和唐山钢厂的节约生铁先进经验。上钢六厂是全国转炉炼钢高产、优质、低耗的红旗，它降低铁耗的主要经验是：通过改进料场管理，来控制铁水化学成份；提高化铁炉的铁水温度，改进转炉操作，以消灭后吹；展开节约生铁和其他辅助材料的劳动竞赛，来保证各项先进经验的贯彻。青岛市生建机械厂的经验是：严格执行操作规程，改酸性化铁炉为热风碱性化铁炉，提高化铁炉的脱硫效率，减少造渣次数，缩短吹炼时间。唐山钢厂的主要经验是：采用酸性化铁炉造碱性渣去硫，使原先要增硫的化铁炉变为脱硫20％到40％的化铁炉。
    这三个厂由于认真地发动群众，贯彻操作规程和采取一些必要的技术措施，普遍做到提高钢的产量、质量和降低生铁消耗。上钢六厂今年以来抓了提高质量，合格率达到98％上下，每吨钢耗用的生铁一直稳定在一千三百公斤以下。唐山钢厂第一炼钢车间用高硫生铁炼钢，4月份各项先进的经验未贯彻到生产中时，钢的合格率只有85.3％，每吨钢的铁耗达一千六百三十二公斤；5月份开始改进各项操作以后，钢的合格率马上提高，铁耗月月有所降低，到9月初合格率提高到99.9％，铁耗降低到一千二百三十六公斤。
    到会代表经过讨论，并且实地参观了上钢六厂、三厂以后，一致认为会上所介绍的先进厂的经验十分宝贵，值得普遍推广。
