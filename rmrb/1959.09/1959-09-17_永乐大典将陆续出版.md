    Yongle Encyclopedia to be Published Sequentially

    The lost volumes of the "Yongle Encyclopedia" will soon be photolithographed and published by Zhonghua Book Company in succession.

    The "Yongle Encyclopedia" is a large-scale encyclopedia compiled during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty in China. It collected as many as seven or eight thousand important books and records from before the Song and Yuan dynasties. These include precious materials on classics, history, philosophy, collections of literature, Buddhist scriptures, Taoist texts, drama, vernacular stories, industrial technology, and agronomy. The entire book, including the table of contents, consists of 22,937 volumes, bound into 11,095 books, totaling approximately 370 million words, all written in regular script. At the time, as many as three thousand Confucian scholars and men of letters participated in the compilation, proofreading, and annotation work, which took six years. Guo Moruo said in the preface to the photolithographic edition of the "Yongle Encyclopedia" that the completion of the "Encyclopedia" not only provides the earliest and largest encyclopedia in the history of Chinese culture but is also outstanding in the world's cultural history.

    It has been more than 550 years since the "Yongle Encyclopedia" was compiled. Before liberation, it suffered many wars, robberies, and losses. The destruction was most severe when the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing in 1900. A portion of it was burned by imperialists, and almost all of the unburned sections were looted. After liberation, the Party attached great importance to classical literature and vigorously collected it. With the selfless assistance of socialist brother countries, 215 original volumes of the "Encyclopedia" were collected. Among them, the Soviet Union donated 64 volumes, the German Democratic Republic donated 3 volumes, and domestic collectors donated 23 volumes. According to incomplete statistics, there are nearly 800 original volumes still in existence. Zhonghua Book Company is photolithographing a total of 720 volumes based on the original volumes and copies in the collection of the Beijing Library, accounting for more than 90% of the existing original volumes.

    The photolithographic edition of the "Yongle Encyclopedia" will be printed entirely on Mao Bian paper and Lian Shi paper, thread-bound and divided into 200 volumes. To allow readers to see the original appearance of the book, Zhonghua Book Company will also publish a facsimile edition of the "乌" (Wu) rhyme volume donated by the Soviet Union, according to the original book size, format, and binding.

    永乐大典将陆续出版
    “永乐大典”的佚存本即将由中华书局影印，陆续出版。
    “永乐大典”是我国明代永乐年间编修的一部大类书。它收集了我国宋元以前重要的图书典籍达七、八千种之多。其中包括经、史、子、集、释藏、道经、戏剧、平话、工技、农艺等方面珍贵的资料。全书连同目录共两万两千九百三十七卷，分装为一万一千零九十五册，约计三亿七千多万字，全部用楷书写成。当时参加编校、圈点工作的儒臣文士达三千人，前后用了六年时间。郭沫若在影印“永乐大典”序中说：“大典”之成，不仅在我国文化史上提供了一部最早最大的百科全书，而且在世界文化史中也是出类拔萃的。
    “永乐大典”编成到现在已有五百五十多年，在解放前几经战火，屡被盗劫，失散颇多。公元1900年八国联军侵入北京时破坏最为严重，一部分已被帝国主义者焚毁，未毁的几乎全被劫走。解放以后，党对古典文献极为重视，大力搜集，加上社会主义兄弟国家的无私帮助，收集到“大典”原本二百一十五册。其中，苏联赠还六十四册，德意志民主共和国赠还三册，国内收藏家捐献二十三册。据不完全的统计，现在流存着的原本约近八百卷，这次中华书局根据北京图书馆所藏原本和复制本影印的共七百二十卷，占现有流存原本的90％以上。
    影印本“永乐大典”，全部用毛边纸和连史纸印刷，线装分订，共两百册。为了使读者能够看到这部书的本来面貌，中华书局还将苏联赠还的“乌”字韵一册，按照原书大小、版式和装帧，印成仿制本出版。
