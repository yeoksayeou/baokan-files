Xinhua News Agency, September 13th, dispatch from New Delhi: Reactionary forces inside and outside India are exploiting the Dalai Lama as a tool to oppose China. Recently, the Dalai Lama was brought to Delhi, the capital of India. Subsequently, a conspiracy to submit the Tibet issue to the United Nations to expand interference in China's internal affairs and intensify the anti-China slander campaign was hatched.

On September 2nd, the Dalai Lama arrived in New Delhi from Mussoorie, where he had been residing since entering India. The Indian government accorded him a grand reception. At the station, Mrs. Menon, Deputy Minister of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, was the first to greet him. Chairman Sinha of the Praja Socialist Party and another leader of the party, Kripalani, Gupta, Chairman of the Delhi State Congress Committee, and Sani, Deputy Mayor of Delhi, also came to the station to welcome him. A crowd gathered outside the station, constantly shouting anti-China slogans: "Chinese Executioners, Get Out of Tibet!" "Down with Chinese Imperialism!" The placards they held read: "Tibetan Autonomy is a Guarantee of India's Security."

The Dalai Lama was taken to the Indian government's guesthouse, Hyderabad House. The Delhi municipal authorities decided to allocate 7,500 rupees to hold a reception to welcome him. He met with Indian government leaders such as President Prasad, Vice President Radhakrishnan, Prime Minister Nehru, Home Minister Pant, and Finance Minister Desai. He also extensively contacted diplomatic envoys from the Philippines, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Thailand, South Vietnam, and other countries stationed in India. According to the Press Trust of India, "Given the Dalai Lama's decision to submit the Tibet issue to the United Nations, and with reports saying that he is looking for a country to raise the issue at the UN, these meetings are considered particularly significant." The report added, "Prime Minister Nehru stated a few days ago that, as far as India is concerned, it will not submit the Tibet issue to the United Nations. In this context, the meetings between the Dalai Lama and these diplomats are even more meaningful."

Before the Dalai Lama arrived in New Delhi, a statement was issued in his name on August 30th in New Delhi, saying that the situation in Tibet "has become so dark and gloomy beyond measure," and therefore "only an appeal to the United Nations" was possible. An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement regarding this declaration, "He is a free man, and he can do whatever he wants." According to the United Nations office of the United States Information Service, on September 9th, a letter was telegraphed to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld from New Delhi in the name of the Dalai Lama, requesting the United Nations to discuss the Tibet issue and immediately intervene in the so-called "aggression by Chinese troops (in Tibet)." This letter repeated the claim that Tibet is a "sovereign state," a claim repeatedly made by imperialists and foreign interventionists, and fabricated some "crimes," such as the Chinese army in Tibet attempting to "eliminate the Tibetan race," "deprive the Tibetan people of their property," and "indiscriminately kill prominent Tibetans."

Since the Tibetan rebellion was quickly quelled by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, reactionary forces in India have been carrying out this conspiracy to use the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. In June of this year, Narayan, who single-handedly directed the infamous anti-China farce "All India Tibet Convention," went to Mussoorie and held a long three-day meeting with the Dalai Lama. This former Praja Socialist Party leader said on June 26th that it was necessary to raise the Tibet issue in the United Nations. He later went to Delhi and actively engaged with diplomatic envoys from the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia, Japan, Malaya, and other countries stationed in India, attempting to organize an "Asian-African Committee" to support Tibetan rebels and attack China.

Also frequently active in Mussoorie were the Tibetan rebels who fled abroad, including Lukhangwa, Gyalo Thondup, Norbu, and Sokhang. Gyalo Thondup and Norbu are the Dalai Lama's brothers. Carrying the mission given by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, they constantly surrounded the Dalai Lama, encouraging him to carry out various conspiracies regarding so-called "Tibetan independence" and opposition to the Chinese government. According to newspaper reports, rebels openly held meetings in Mussoorie in the name of the "Kashag" (Tibetan local government) and even raised the so-called "Tibetan national flag" in front of the Dalai Lama's residence at one point. In addition, those who had meetings with the Dalai Lama included the Prince of Sikkim, the Grand Lama of Ladakh, and a "delegation of monks" from Ceylon, which reportedly discussed the formation of an "anti-communist Buddhist front" headed by him.

From the beginning of May, officials in Mussoorie, according to a notice from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, arranged for the Dalai Lama to meet the public once a week. According to a report in "The Statesman" on May 20th, after the Indian public's interest in the Dalai Lama waned, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs decided to have photographers take pictures of the Dalai Lama. Subsequently, after much activity and careful preparation, the Dalai Lama appeared at a press conference held in Mussoorie on June 20th. At the meeting, he read a prepared speech, answered more than ninety questions raised by reporters, and also read a statement that used many phrases slandering China that were commonly used by imperialists and foreign interventionists, revealing their intentions nakedly. For example, that the Chinese were trying to "eliminate Tibetan religion, culture, and even annex the Tibetan race," that "the rebellion of the Khampas was a national uprising," that "the Chinese destroyed Buddhism," and "destroyed monasteries"... This speech openly stated that a small group of Tibetan rebels who fled to India were the "Tibetan government," and also openly proposed the establishment of a "Greater Tibet" composed of Tibet, Amdo (generally referring to the southern part of Qinghai and part of the southern part of Gansu Tibetan areas), and the Kham region (Qamdo area). The speech also requested that Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai hold talks to resolve the Tibet issue, which is purely China's internal affair. According to reports, when the Dalai Lama read this speech, rebel leaders Sokhang, Liuxia, and Gyalo Thondup were sitting behind him, and Menon, the Indian government official responsible for receiving him, was sitting in the Birla Villa near the venue. According to reports, "He tirelessly explained to reporters" that he had nothing to do with this reception. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also issued a special statement on June 30th stating that "there is no question of a Tibetan government led by the Dalai Lama carrying out activities in India," and stated that the Indian government is not responsible for the Dalai Lama's speech.

However, as early as May 25th, the Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" revealed the news that this press conference would be held, and said that "Delhi believes that it would be beneficial to all parties concerned, including himself, if the Dalai Lama spoke to the world in the first person singular." On June 6th, a reporter for "The Statesman" revealed that the Indian government had asked the Dalai Lama to hold a press conference at least three times.

While reporting on these activities of the Dalai Lama, foreign newspapers and news agencies also reported on some statements, telegrams, and letters issued in his name. A statement issued on May 16th called on Buddhists all over the world to pray for Tibetans "who sacrificed their lives in Tibet and those who are still suffering terrible pain in spirit and body." According to reports, the Dalai Lama also exchanged letters and telegrams with the "Delhi Tibet Affairs Committee" and the "Indian Support Tibet Committee," which were organized by some Indian right-wing figures. In addition, it is said that the Dalai Lama's "Chief Secretary" Tuden Norsang telegraphed Gu Zheng-gang, the director of the so-called "All-Circles Assistance Committee for People Behind the Iron Curtain to Strive for Freedom" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, on behalf of the Dalai Lama, thanking him for his support for the rebels. The reactionary organization "Asian People's Anti-Communist League" manipulated by U.S. imperialism also telegraphed the Dalai Lama to express "encouragement and support."

The Philippine so-called Magsaysay Award Foundation designated the Dalai Lama on August 15th as the recipient of the 1959 "Social Leadership Award" to reward the role he played in the "heroic struggle" in Tibet. This award was established in memory of the late pro-American Philippine President Magsaysay. Tibetan rebel Gyalo Thondup received this "award" of $10,000 on behalf of the Dalai Lama on August 31st. There are also reports that the "Indian Relief Tibet Committee" and the "American Emergency Committee for Assistance to Tibetan Refugees" also gave 50,000 rupees to the Tibetan rebels.

Regarding these frequent political activities of the Dalai Lama, Indian figures and public opinion have different reactions.

Some leaders of right-wing political parties strongly advocated allowing the Dalai Lama to carry out political activities according to their wishes without restriction. Meda, the head of the Praja Socialist Party, demanded that the Dalai Lama be allowed to "conduct the struggle for freedom with dignity" in India. Indian People's Alliance member of parliament Bajpai shouted in the People's House on May 8th, "If Chinese leaders cannot be put on the right path by other means, then there is no other choice but to allow the Dalai Lama to carry out activities from here." Praja Socialist Party member of parliament Davi also advocated on May 9th giving the Dalai Lama a so-called "reasonable opportunity" to draw the world's attention to the Tibet issue.

However, fair-minded Indian public opinion clearly pointed out the serious consequences of this political activity. "The Pioneer" said on April 21st that if the Dalai Lama's supporters used India as a base of operations, it would inevitably involve India in a conflict with China, which would be completely inappropriate. "The United India" also said on May 13th, "The Dalai Lama has no political status in our country. Our country granted him asylum on the condition that he does not engage in any political activities here, and he does not wage a war on Tibet from Indian soil." The newspaper said that inviting the Dalai Lama to visit Delhi had a political purpose, which was to use the Dalai Lama to abuse China from the Indian capital, thereby completely destroying the friendship between India and China. "If this goal is achieved, the reactionaries of Britain and the United States will benefit, but India will not. Therefore, we strongly urge the Indian government not to let the Dalai Lama visit Delhi."

    印反动派加紧利用达赖进行反华活动
    正在策划把所谓“西藏问题”提交联合国
    阴谋扩大干涉中国内政加强对我国诽谤
    新华社13日讯　新德里消息：印度国内外的反动势力正在利用达赖喇嘛来作为反对中国的工具。最近，达赖喇嘛被人接到印度首都德里。接着，一个把西藏问题提交联合国以扩大干涉中国内政和加强反华诽谤运动的阴谋计划就出笼了。
    9月2日，达赖喇嘛从他入印以后一直居住的穆索里到达新德里。印度官方给予隆重接待。在车站上，印度外交部副部长梅农夫人第一个走上去迎接他。人民社会党主席辛哈和这个党的另一个首脑克里帕拉尼、国大党德里邦委员会主席古普塔和德里副市长萨尼等人都到车站欢迎。车站外面聚集了一群人，不断呼喊反华口号：“中国刽子手滚出西藏去！”“打倒中国帝国主义！”他们手里拿着的标语牌写着：“西藏自治是印度的安全的保障”。
    达赖喇嘛被送到印度政府的迎宾馆海得拉巴大厦居住。德里市政机构决定拨付七千五百卢比来举行招待会欢迎他。他会见了印度总统普拉沙德、副总统拉达克里希南、总理尼赫鲁、内政部长潘特、财政部长德赛等印度政府负责人。他还同菲律宾、日本、美国、英国、泰国、南越等驻印度使节广泛进行接触。据印度报业托辣斯报道，“鉴于达赖喇嘛决定把西藏问题提交联合国，并且有消息说，他正在找寻某个国家把这个问题在联合国提出，人们认为这些会谈具有特别的意义。”消息又说，“尼赫鲁总理曾经在几天前表明，就印度来说，它不会把西藏问题提交联合国。在这种情况下，达赖喇嘛和这些外交家举行的会谈就更有意义。”
    在达赖喇嘛到达新德里之前，8月30日在新德里就以他的名义发表了一项声明，说什么西藏情况“变得黑暗和阴沉到不可估量”，因此“只有向联合国发出呼吁”。印度外交部一位发言人就这项声明发表谈话时说，“他是一个自由人，他想做什么就可以做什么”。据美国新闻处联合国消息，9月9日，从新德里以达赖喇嘛的名义用电报发给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的一封信件，要求联合国讨论西藏问题和立即干预所谓“中国部队（在西藏）的侵略行为”。这封信重复帝国主义和外国干涉者一再提出的所谓西藏是一个“主权国家”的说法，还捏造了所谓中国军队在西藏企图“消灭西藏种族”，“夺去西藏人民的财产”，“无缘无故杀害西藏著名人物”等的一些“罪行”。
    在西藏叛乱被中国人民解放军迅速平息以后，印度反动势力就在进行这种阴谋利用联合国来干涉中国内政的活动。今年6月间，曾经一手导演臭名远扬的反华丑剧“全印西藏会议”的纳拉扬，就到过穆索里同达赖喇嘛进行了三天的长时间的会谈。这个前人民社会党领袖在6月26日说，有必要在联合国中提出西藏问题。他事后到德里去，向英国、南斯拉夫、日本、马来亚等国驻印度使节大肆活动，图谋组织一个“亚非委员会”来支持西藏叛匪和攻击中国。
    在穆索里进行频繁活动的还有逃亡在国外的西藏叛匪鲁康娃、嘉乐登珠、诺布、索康等人。嘉乐登珠和诺布是达赖喇嘛的哥哥。他们带着美国和蒋介石集团所给予的使命，经常包围达赖，怂恿他进行关于所谓“西藏独立”和反对中国政府的种种阴谋活动。据报纸消息，叛匪在穆索里公然以“噶厦”（西藏地方政府）的名义开会，并且一度在达赖喇嘛的住所前面升起所谓的“西藏国旗”。此外，同达赖喇嘛会谈过的还有锡金王子、拉达克大喇嘛和一个锡兰“僧侣代表团”，据报道，这个“代表团”曾经同达赖喇嘛讨论了成立一个以他为首的“反共佛教阵线”的问题。
    从5月上旬起，穆索里的官员就根据印度外交部的通知，每星期给达赖喇嘛安排一次同公众见面的活动。据“政治家报”5月20日报道，在印度公众对达赖喇嘛的兴趣减弱以后，印度外交部又作出决定，让摄影记者给达赖喇嘛照相。随后，经过多方面的活动和周密的准备，达赖喇嘛出面在6月20日在穆索里举行了一次记者招待会。他在会上宣读了事先准备好的一篇谈话，答复了记者提出的九十多个问题，还宣读了一篇声明，里面使用了许多为帝国主义者和外国干涉者所惯用的诽谤中国的词句，露骨地反映了他们的图谋。例如什么中国人试图“消灭西藏宗教、文化，甚至吞并西藏种族”，“康巴人的反叛是民族起义”，“中国人摧毁佛教”、“毁坏寺院”……。这篇谈话公然表示逃亡到印度的一小撮西藏叛匪是什么“西藏政府”，还公然提出要成立一个由西藏、安多（一般指青海南部和甘肃南部一部分藏族地区）和康地区（昌都地区）组成的“大西藏”。谈话还要求由印度总理尼赫鲁和中国总理周恩来举行会谈来解决纯属中国内政的西藏问题。据报道，在达赖宣读这篇谈话的时候，叛匪头目索康、柳霞和嘉乐登珠等人坐在他后面，印度政府负责接待他的官员梅农坐在会场附近的比拉别墅中，据报道，“他不厌其烦地向新闻记者解释”，他同这个招待会无关。印度外交部在6月30日也特地发表声明表示“不存在达赖喇嘛领导下的西藏政府在印度进行活动的问题”，并且表示印度政府不对达赖喇嘛的谈话负责。
    但是，早在5月25日，印度“甘露市场报”就透露了将要召开这次记者招待会的消息，并且说“德里相信，假如达赖以第一人称单数在世界面前说话，这对各有关方面，包括他本人在内，是有好处的”。6月6日，“政治家报”记者又透露，印度政府曾经至少三次要求达赖喇嘛举行记者招待会。
    在报道达赖喇嘛的这些活动的同时，外国报纸、通讯社还报道了用他的名义发表的一些声明、电文和信件。在5月16日发表的声明，呼吁全世界佛教徒为所谓“在西藏牺牲生命和那些仍然在精神上肉体上受到可怕痛苦的”西藏人祈祷。据报道，达赖还和一些印度右派人物组织的什么“德里西藏事务委员会”、“印度支援西藏委员会”等互通函电。此外，据说是达赖喇嘛的“主任秘书”土登诺桑曾经代表达赖喇嘛打电报给蒋介石集团的所谓“各界援助铁幕内人民争取自由委员会”主任谷正纲，感谢他对叛匪的支持。美帝国主义操纵的反动组织“亚洲人民反共联盟”也曾经打电报给达赖喇嘛表示“鼓励和支持”。
    菲律宾的所谓麦格赛赛奖金保管委员会8月15日指定达赖喇嘛为1959年“社会领导奖金”的获得者，以奖励他在西藏的“英勇斗争”中所起的作用。这个奖金是为纪念已故的亲美的菲律宾总统麦格赛赛而设立的。西藏叛匪嘉乐登珠已在8月31日代表达赖喇嘛领取了这笔为数一万美元的“奖金”。还有消息说，“印度救济西藏委员会”和“美国援助西藏难民紧急委员会”也给了西藏叛匪五万卢比。
    关于达赖喇嘛这些频繁的政治活动，印度人士和舆论有不同的反应。
    一些右派政党领袖极力主张不加限制地让达赖喇嘛按照他们的意愿进行政治活动。人民社会党首脑梅达要求让达赖喇嘛在印度“体面地进行争取自由的斗争”。印度人民同盟议员巴志帕伊5月8日在人民院叫嚷“如果不能以其它办法使中国领导人走上正路的话，那么，除了允许达赖喇嘛从这里进行活动以外别无其他抉择。”人民社会党议员达维5月9日也主张给达赖喇嘛以所谓“合理的机会”以便引起全世界对西藏问题的注意。
    但是，印度公正的舆论明白地指出了这种政治活动的严重后果。“箴言报”在4月21日说，如果达赖喇嘛的支持者把印度当作活动的基地，这必然会使印度牵涉到同中国的冲突中去，这样是完全不适当的。“团结报”在5月13日也说，“达赖喇嘛在我们国家内没有政治地位。我们国家给了他避难权，条件是他不在这里进行任何政治活动，他不在印度国土上进行西藏战争。”这家报纸说，邀请达赖喇嘛访问德里，具有政治目的，那就是利用达赖喇嘛从印度的首都来辱骂中国，从而完全毁灭印度和中国的友谊。“如果这个目的实现的话，那么英美两国的反动派将得到好处，但印度可得不到。因此，我们强烈吁请印度政府不要让达赖喇嘛访问德里。”
