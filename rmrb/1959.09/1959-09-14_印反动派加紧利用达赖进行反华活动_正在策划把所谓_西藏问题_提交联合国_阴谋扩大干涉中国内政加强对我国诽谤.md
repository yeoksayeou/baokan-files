Xinhua News Agency, September 13th, dispatch from New Delhi: Reactionary forces inside and outside India are exploiting the Dalai Lama as a tool to oppose China. Recently, the Dalai Lama was brought to Delhi, the capital of India. Subsequently, a conspiracy to submit the Tibet issue to the United Nations to expand interference in China's internal affairs and intensify the anti-China slander campaign was hatched.

On September 2nd, the Dalai Lama arrived in New Delhi from Mussoorie, where he had been residing since entering India. The Indian government accorded him a grand reception. At the station, Mrs. Menon, Deputy Minister of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, was the first to greet him. Chairman Sinha of the Praja Socialist Party and another leader of the party, Kripalani, Gupta, Chairman of the Delhi State Congress Committee, and Sani, Deputy Mayor of Delhi, also came to the station to welcome him. A crowd gathered outside the station, constantly shouting anti-China slogans: "Chinese Executioners, Get Out of Tibet!" "Down with Chinese Imperialism!" The placards they held read: "Tibetan Autonomy is a Guarantee of India's Security."

The Dalai Lama was taken to the Indian government's guesthouse, Hyderabad House. The Delhi municipal authorities decided to allocate 7,500 rupees to hold a reception to welcome him. He met with Indian government leaders such as President Prasad, Vice President Radhakrishnan, Prime Minister Nehru, Home Minister Pant, and Finance Minister Desai. He also extensively contacted diplomatic envoys from the Philippines, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Thailand, South Vietnam, and other countries stationed in India. According to the Press Trust of India, "Given the Dalai Lama's decision to submit the Tibet issue to the United Nations, and with reports saying that he is looking for a country to raise the issue at the UN, these meetings are considered particularly significant." The report added, "Prime Minister Nehru stated a few days ago that, as far as India is concerned, it will not submit the Tibet issue to the United Nations. In this context, the meetings between the Dalai Lama and these diplomats are even more meaningful."

Before the Dalai Lama arrived in New Delhi, a statement was issued in his name on August 30th in New Delhi, saying that the situation in Tibet "has become so dark and gloomy beyond measure," and therefore "only an appeal to the United Nations" was possible. An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement regarding this declaration, "He is a free man, and he can do whatever he wants." According to the United Nations office of the United States Information Service, on September 9th, a letter was telegraphed to UN Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld from New Delhi in the name of the Dalai Lama, requesting the United Nations to discuss the Tibet issue and immediately intervene in the so-called "aggression by Chinese troops (in Tibet)." This letter repeated the claim that Tibet is a "sovereign state," a claim repeatedly made by imperialists and foreign interventionists, and fabricated some "crimes," such as the Chinese army in Tibet attempting to "eliminate the Tibetan race," "deprive the Tibetan people of their property," and "indiscriminately kill prominent Tibetans."

Since the Tibetan rebellion was quickly quelled by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, reactionary forces in India have been carrying out this conspiracy to use the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. In June of this year, Narayan, who single-handedly directed the infamous anti-China farce "All India Tibet Convention," went to Mussoorie and held a long three-day meeting with the Dalai Lama. This former Praja Socialist Party leader said on June 26th that it was necessary to raise the Tibet issue in the United Nations. He later went to Delhi and actively engaged with diplomatic envoys from the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia, Japan, Malaya, and other countries stationed in India, attempting to organize an "Asian-African Committee" to support Tibetan rebels and attack China.

Also frequently active in Mussoorie were the Tibetan rebels who fled abroad, including Lukhangwa, Gyalo Thondup, Norbu, and Sokhang. Gyalo Thondup and Norbu are the Dalai Lama's brothers. Carrying the mission given by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, they constantly surrounded the Dalai Lama, encouraging him to carry out various conspiracies regarding so-called "Tibetan independence" and opposition to the Chinese government. According to newspaper reports, rebels openly held meetings in Mussoorie in the name of the "Kashag" (Tibetan local government) and even raised the so-called "Tibetan national flag" in front of the Dalai Lama's residence at one point. In addition, those who had meetings with the Dalai Lama included the Prince of Sikkim, the Grand Lama of Ladakh, and a "delegation of monks" from Ceylon, which reportedly discussed the formation of an "anti-communist Buddhist front" headed by him.

From the beginning of May, officials in Mussoorie, according to a notice from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, arranged for the Dalai Lama to meet the public once a week. According to a report in "The Statesman" on May 20th, after the Indian public's interest in the Dalai Lama waned, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs decided to have photographers take pictures of the Dalai Lama. Subsequently, after much activity and careful preparation, the Dalai Lama appeared at a press conference held in Mussoorie on June 20th. At the meeting, he read a prepared speech, answered more than ninety questions raised by reporters, and also read a statement that used many phrases slandering China that were commonly used by imperialists and foreign interventionists, revealing their intentions nakedly. For example, that the Chinese were trying to "eliminate Tibetan religion, culture, and even annex the Tibetan race," that "the rebellion of the Khampas was a national uprising," that "the Chinese destroyed Buddhism," and "destroyed monasteries"... This speech openly stated that a small group of Tibetan rebels who fled to India were the "Tibetan government," and also openly proposed the establishment of a "Greater Tibet" composed of Tibet, Amdo (generally referring to the southern part of Qinghai and part of the southern part of Gansu Tibetan areas), and the Kham region (Qamdo area). The speech also requested that Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai hold talks to resolve the Tibet issue, which is purely China's internal affair. According to reports, when the Dalai Lama read this speech, rebel leaders Sokhang, Liuxia, and Gyalo Thondup were sitting behind him, and Menon, the Indian government official responsible for receiving him, was sitting in the Birla Villa near the venue. According to reports, "He tirelessly explained to reporters" that he had nothing to do with this reception. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also issued a special statement on June 30th stating that "there is no question of a Tibetan government led by the Dalai Lama carrying out activities in India," and stated that the Indian government is not responsible for the Dalai Lama's speech.

However, as early as May 25th, the Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" revealed the news that this press conference would be held, and said that "Delhi believes that it would be beneficial to all parties concerned, including himself, if the Dalai Lama spoke to the world in the first person singular." On June 6th, a reporter for "The Statesman" revealed that the Indian government had asked the Dalai Lama to hold a press conference at least three times.

While reporting on these activities of the Dalai Lama, foreign newspapers and news agencies also reported on some statements, telegrams, and letters issued in his name. A statement issued on May 16th called on Buddhists all over the world to pray for Tibetans "who sacrificed their lives in Tibet and those who are still suffering terrible pain in spirit and body." According to reports, the Dalai Lama also exchanged letters and telegrams with the "Delhi Tibet Affairs Committee" and the "Indian Support Tibet Committee," which were organized by some Indian right-wing figures. In addition, it is said that the Dalai Lama's "Chief Secretary" Tuden Norsang telegraphed Gu Zheng-gang, the director of the so-called "All-Circles Assistance Committee for People Behind the Iron Curtain to Strive for Freedom" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, on behalf of the Dalai Lama, thanking him for his support for the rebels. The reactionary organization "Asian People's Anti-Communist League" manipulated by U.S. imperialism also telegraphed the Dalai Lama to express "encouragement and support."

The Philippine so-called Magsaysay Award Foundation designated the Dalai Lama on August 15th as the recipient of the 1959 "Social Leadership Award" to reward the role he played in the "heroic struggle" in Tibet. This award was established in memory of the late pro-American Philippine President Magsaysay. Tibetan rebel Gyalo Thondup received this "award" of $10,000 on behalf of the Dalai Lama on August 31st. There are also reports that the "Indian Relief Tibet Committee" and the "American Emergency Committee for Assistance to Tibetan Refugees" also gave 50,000 rupees to the Tibetan rebels.

Regarding these frequent political activities of the Dalai Lama, Indian figures and public opinion have different reactions.

Some leaders of right-wing political parties strongly advocated allowing the Dalai Lama to carry out political activities according to their wishes without restriction. Meda, the head of the Praja Socialist Party, demanded that the Dalai Lama be allowed to "conduct the struggle for freedom with dignity" in India. Indian People's Alliance member of parliament Bajpai shouted in the People's House on May 8th, "If Chinese leaders cannot be put on the right path by other means, then there is no other choice but to allow the Dalai Lama to carry out activities from here." Praja Socialist Party member of parliament Davi also advocated on May 9th giving the Dalai Lama a so-called "reasonable opportunity" to draw the world's attention to the Tibet issue.

However, fair-minded Indian public opinion clearly pointed out the serious consequences of this political activity. "The Pioneer" said on April 21st that if the Dalai Lama's supporters used India as a base of operations, it would inevitably involve India in a conflict with China, which would be completely inappropriate. "The United India" also said on May 13th, "The Dalai Lama has no political status in our country. Our country granted him asylum on the condition that he does not engage in any political activities here, and he does not wage a war on Tibet from Indian soil." The newspaper said that inviting the Dalai Lama to visit Delhi had a political purpose, which was to use the Dalai Lama to abuse China from the Indian capital, thereby completely destroying the friendship between India and China. "If this goal is achieved, the reactionaries of Britain and the United States will benefit, but India will not. Therefore, we strongly urge the Indian government not to let the Dalai Lama visit Delhi."
