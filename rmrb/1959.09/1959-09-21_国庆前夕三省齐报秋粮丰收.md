    Three Provinces Report Autumn Grain Harvest on Eve of National Day
    Shandong Completes Harvesting of 30 Million Mu of Early Autumn Crops; Three-Autumn Work Fully Underway
    Anhui Achieves Large-Scale Bumper Harvest of Intermediate Rice After Overcoming Severe Drought
    More Than 2 Million Jiangsu Commune Members Using Careful Harvesting to Greet National Day
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 20th: Shandong Province has completed harvesting of over 30 million mu of early autumn crops, with frequent reports of bumper harvests. The broad masses of commune members are dedicating their practical actions of good harvesting and sales to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation.
    This year, the early autumn crops in Shandong suffered from an unprecedented summer drought and severe insect pests, and some areas suffered from floods and wind damage. However, the people of all regions have given full play to the infinite power of the people's communes, and after several months of fighting disaster and ensuring harvests, most of the early autumn crops have finally achieved a bumper harvest. Some areas have turned major disasters into major harvests.
    During the harvesting process, news of bumper harvests came frequently. Tancheng County, where harvesting and threshing have basically been completed recently, saw an average yield of 400 jin per mu for 840,000 mu of early autumn crops, an increase of more than 20% over last year. At the same time, many high-yield demonstration fields have emerged. In Guankou Brigade, Guankou Commune, Shouzhang County, a 100-mu cadre experimental field achieved a yield of over 1,500 jin per mu. The broad masses of peasants praised the bumper harvest, saying, "The people's commune is powerful, not afraid of water, drought, or pests; disaster years become bumper years, and the people are masters of the affairs of heaven."
    The bumper harvest of early autumn crops once again proves the great power of the people's communes. Shandong suffered a major drought this summer, lasting for about two months. At its worst, the drought affected 73.07 million mu of land throughout the province. Under the leadership of the Party, people in various regions mobilized more than 10 million laborers every day to fight the drought and protect the harvest, persisting in drought resistance and ensuring harvests. After a drought appeared in Linyi City, the people's communes mobilized 280,000 people to participate in the drought resistance struggle. After more than ten days of day and night fighting, 788,000 mu of land were irrigated. Not only was the role of existing water conservancy facilities brought into full play, but new wells were dug, springs were excavated, and water conservancy projects were built during the drought resistance, expanding the irrigated area by 180,000 mu.
    In the rush to harvest, the people's commune once again showed its great power. During the autumn harvest in Yantai Prefecture, there were typhoons and rainstorms, with more than 479,000 mu of early autumn crops flooded. 380,000 commune members launched a struggle to seize grain and overcome the wind and rain. In Jiangshanwa, Laiyang County, 160,000 mu of crops were flooded. The communes in the county, supported by more than 30,000 people led by the secretaries and county heads, braved the rain to rescue the crops and drained the water in two days. In areas not affected by disasters, every effort was made to ensure that every grain was stored in the granary and every stalk was returned to the stack.
    The bumper harvest of early autumn crops has greatly encouraged the people of Shandong to strive for higher yields in late autumn and the three-autumn campaign. People excitedly said that this autumn is "four joys coming at once, joy upon joy" - the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation, the first anniversary of the establishment of the commune, and a bumper harvest. Now the late autumn surpassing the early autumn has entered the final decisive stage; the three-autumn work has been fully launched; early autumn crops are being sold while being harvested. As of the 10th of this month, the province has purchased 900 million jin of coarse grains. Eight counties, including Wulian, Tancheng, Linyi, and Guanxian, have overfulfilled their early autumn procurement tasks.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 20th: After achieving a bumper harvest of early rice, the broad masses of commune members in Anhui Province have overcome severe drought with tenacious fighting spirit and determination, and have achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of intermediate rice. By September 14th, 7 million mu of the province's 10.7 million mu of intermediate rice had been harvested. In the threshing process, reports of large-scale bumper harvests were frequently received.
    During the growth period of intermediate rice in Anhui Province, it encountered severe drought. In late June, drought appeared in the Huaibei Plain and the Jianghuai hilly area. Then, the drought rapidly expanded from north to south. By late August, the drought had spread to all parts of the province, seriously affecting the growth of intermediate rice. However, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of commune members gave full play to the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, opening canals, building dams, diverting water to turn over the hills, and resisting drought to protect seedlings, winning a large-scale bumper harvest of intermediate rice. News of bumper harvests was also frequently reported from Lu'an Prefecture and Hefei area, where the drought was relatively severe. In Ai Guo Commune, Shou County, 70,900 mu of intermediate rice grew well everywhere. More than 29,000 mu have been harvested, and the average yield of 6,120 mu that have been threshed is 871 jin per mu, of which the average yield of 2,448 mu exceeds 1,000 jin. In Guta Brigade, Mengji Commune, Huoqiu County, the average yield of 3,003 mu of threshed intermediate rice is 1,067 jin per mu, an increase of 150% over last year. The intermediate rice in the dryland converted into paddy fields in the Huaibei area also achieved a bumper harvest. For example, the average yield of 4,794 mu of intermediate rice in Liulin People's Commune, Funan County, was 1,164 jin per mu after harvesting and threshing verification, more than double last year. Although these areas were threatened during the drought, the river network project has made great progress in the past two years, providing favorable conditions for resisting drought and ensuring harvests. For example, Liulin People's Commune, Funan County, just established last winter, mobilized more than 18,000 laborers to dig seven new rivers, initially realizing the river network, and concentrated the converted paddy rice in the place with the best water source. In the drought resistance, a large-scale collaboration was organized, concentrating many pumping machines and water lifting tools for irrigation, thus ensuring a bumper harvest of converted paddy rice in the year of a major drought of eighty days without rain.
    The good news of the bumper harvest of intermediate rice is even more frequent in Wuhu and Anqing Prefectures, where the drought was lighter. In Wuhu Prefecture, 1.33 million mu of intermediate rice (excluding early and intermediate rice) have harvested 1.15 million mu. The yellow-ripe intermediate rice has all been harvested, and the results of threshing generally show an increase in production compared to last year. In Tangchi People's Commune, Yuexi County, Anqing Prefecture, 2,003 mu of intermediate rice were harvested and verified, with an average yield of 1,501 jin per mu, an increase of nearly 100% over last year.
    The intermediate rice in various parts of Anhui Province has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest, but because the drought came early and lasted for a long time this year, some areas still suffered certain losses in intermediate rice. According to statistics, about 3.5 million mu of intermediate rice in the province suffered serious yield reductions due to drought. In order to reduce the losses caused by drought and not waste a single grain, now the broad masses of commune members in various communes, inspired by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, are working with soaring enthusiasm, focusing on the threshing of intermediate rice to ensure careful harvesting and storage of every grain.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 20th: From the south of Lake Tai to Xuhuai in the north of Jiangsu Province, there is a joyous scene of a bumper harvest of intermediate rice everywhere. The harvest of more than 19 million mu of intermediate rice in the province has fully begun. At present, more than 2 million commune members who have invested in the rush to harvest are using the actual actions of careful harvesting to greet the 10th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland.
    The growth of intermediate rice in Jiangsu this year is better than last year. The harvest time is also earlier than in previous years. From the end of August to the beginning of September, nearly 4 million mu of intermediate indica rice in Yangzhou and Yancheng Prefectures in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu have been harvested one after another. A large area of intermediate japonica rice in Jiangyin, Jingjiang and other counties on both sides of the Yangtze River has also recently begun to be harvested. Cadres and the masses in various counties are all nervously engaged in the autumn harvest campaign. Gaoyou County organized 110,000 people to rush to harvest intermediate rice, and more than 1,000 government cadres went to the countryside to help harvest. Baoying, Huai'an and other counties along the Grand Canal were hit by heavy rain while harvesting intermediate rice. In order to achieve a bumper harvest, the broad masses worked day and night to rush to harvest and transport. In Huai'an County, 210,000 cadres and the masses rushed to harvest. After six days and nights of hard work, all the 200,000 mu of medium-ripe rice in the county were rushed to the field, avoiding losses due to germination and rotting. In Yangzhong County, located in the heart of the Yangtze River, the ridges and roads of each commune were built flat and tidy during the harvest of intermediate rice. When the commune members carried the rice stalks to the field, they ensured that "the rice does not drag on the ground, and the panicles are not missed." When threshing, they generally thresh, sweep, and inspect at the same time. The elderly and children also organized professional teams to pick up rice ears and rice grains. The county has picked up 35,000 jin of rice.
    Many large-scale high-yield fields have emerged in various places during the harvest. Jiangyin, Jingjiang, Yangzhong, Gaoyou, Yancheng and other counties, which are famous for producing intermediate rice, have increased production by 20% to 30% respectively compared with last year. Panhuang Commune, Yancheng County, which has poor production conditions, has also changed its past low-yield appearance. The 18,000 mu of intermediate rice that have been threshed in the whole commune has increased by more than 50% compared with last year. A large number of thousand-jin fields have also appeared in Yangzhong County. The actual harvest yield of intermediate rice in all eleven communes in the county exceeded the original contract production target. (Attached picture)

    国庆前夕三省齐报秋粮丰收
    山东三千万亩早秋作物全部登场三秋工作全面展开
    安徽各地战胜严重干旱后赢得了中稻大面积丰收
    江苏二百多万社员正以精收细打的行动迎接国庆
    据新华社济南20日电　山东省三千多万亩早秋作物全部登场，丰收捷报频传。广大社员纷纷以收好、售好的实际行动向建国十周年献礼。
    今年，山东各地的早秋作物，虽然遭受了几十年来所未有的伏旱和严重的虫害，部分地区遭受了水灾和风灾。但是，各地人民充分发挥了人民公社的无穷威力，经过数月的抗灾保收斗争，终于使大部分早秋获得丰收，有些地区把大灾变成大丰收。
    在收打过程中，纷纷传来丰收喜讯。最近收打脱粒已经基本完毕的郯城县，八十四万亩早秋作物平均亩产四百斤，比去年增产二成以上。同时，还出现了许多高额丰产田。寿张县关门口公社关门口大队，有一百亩干部试验田，亩产突破了一千五百斤大关。广大农民歌颂大丰收道：“人民公社力量大，水、旱、虫害都不怕，灾年变成丰收年，天宫之事人当家”。
    早秋作物的大丰收，再一次证明人民公社的巨大威力。山东今年夏季遭受大旱，持续两个月左右。最严重时全省受旱面积达七千三百零七万亩。各地人民在党的领导下，每天出动一千多万劳动大军与旱魔搏斗，坚持抗旱保收。临沂市出现旱象以后，各人民公社出动二十八万人投入抗旱斗争，经过十多天的日夜奋战，浇地七十八万八千亩。不仅充分发挥了现有水利设施的作用，且在抗旱中打新井、挖泉、兴修水利，扩大了灌溉面积十八万亩。
    在抢收中，人民公社又大显神威。烟台专区秋收中发生台风暴雨，有四十七万九千多亩早秋积水，三十八万个社员展开了夺粮的斗争，战胜了风雨。莱阳县姜山洼十六万亩作物积水，这个县各公社支援三万多人，书记、县长带领，冒雨抢救，两天就把积水排出。在未受灾害的地区，更是千方百计争取颗粒入仓，寸草归垛。
    早秋大丰收，大大鼓舞了山东人民的晚秋超产和三秋运动。人民兴奋地说，今年秋季是“四喜临门，喜上加喜”——党的八届八中全会、建国十周年、公社成立一周年，又加上大丰收。现在晚秋超早秋已经进入最后的决战阶段；三秋工作全面展开；早秋边打边交售，截至本月10日止，全省已征购粗粮九亿斤，五莲、郯城、临沂、冠县等八个县的早秋征购任务，已经超额完成。
    据新华社合肥20日电　安徽省各地广大社员在取得早稻大丰收之后，又以顽强的斗志和决心战胜了严重干旱，取得了中稻的大面积丰收。到9月14日，全省一千零七十万亩中稻，已收割七百万亩，在脱粒中大面积丰收喜报纷纷传来。
    安徽省在中稻生长期间，曾遇到严重干旱。6月下旬淮北平原和江淮丘陵地区发生旱象，接着，旱情由北向南迅速扩大，到8月下旬，干旱即波及全省各地，严重地影响了中稻生长。但广大社员在党的领导下，充分发挥了人民公社的无比优越性，开渠打坝，引水翻岗，抗旱保苗，赢得了中稻大面积丰收。旱情比较严重的六安专区和合肥地区，丰收的喜讯也频频传出。寿县爱国公社七万零九百亩中稻，块块都生长得很好，现已收割了二万九千多亩，经过脱粒的六千一百二十亩平均亩产八百七十一斤，其中二千四百四十八亩平均亩产超过千斤。霍丘县孟集公社鼓塔大队已脱粒的三千零三亩中稻，平均亩产一千零六十七斤，比去年亩产增长一倍半。淮北地区旱地改水地的中稻也获得大丰收。如阜南县柳林人民公社四千七百九十四亩中稻，经过收打脱粒核实，平均亩产一千一百六十四斤，比去年增加一倍多。这些地区在干旱期间虽然受到威胁，但由于两年来河网化工程有了巨大进展，为抗旱保收提供了有利的条件。如阜南县柳林人民公社，去冬公社刚刚成立，就发动一万八千多劳力，开挖了七条新河，初步实现了河网化，并且把改种的水稻，集中到水源最好的地方。在抗旱中又组织了大协作，集中许多抽水机械、提水工具灌溉，因而在八十天不雨的大旱年，保证了改种水稻的大丰收。
    旱情较轻的芜湖、安庆两专区，中稻丰收喜讯更是频传。芜湖专区一百三十三万亩中稻（不包括早中稻）已收割一百一十五万亩，黄熟的中稻全部收完，脱粒的结果普遍比去年增产。安庆专区的岳西县汤池人民公社二千零三亩成片中稻，经收打过秤核实，平均亩产一千五百零一斤，比去年增产将近一倍。
    安徽省各地中稻获得大面积丰收，但由于今年旱情来得早，时间长，有些地区中稻仍受到一定损失，据统计，全省中稻因受旱严重减产的有三百五十万亩左右。为了减少受旱的损失，不浪费一颗粮食，现在各地公社广大社员在党的八届八中全会的号召鼓舞下，人人干劲冲天，狠抓中稻脱粒工作，保证做到细收细打，颗粒归仓。
    据新华社南京20日电　江苏省南起太湖北至徐淮，到处呈现着中稻丰收的欢乐景象。全省一千九百多万亩中稻，已经全面开始收割。目前，全省投入抢收抢割的二百多万名社员，正以精收细打的实际行动，迎接我们伟大祖国的建国十周年。
    江苏今年中稻生长胜过去年。收割的时间也比往年早，从8月底到9月上旬，苏北里下河地带的扬州、盐城两专区近四百万亩中籼稻，就已经先后登场。长江两岸的江阴、靖江等县大面积的中粳稻也在最近开始收割。各县干部和群众都紧张地投入了秋收运动。高邮县组织十一万人，突击抢收中稻，机关干部有一千多人下乡帮助收割。沿运河的宝应、淮安等县在收割中稻时遭受到暴雨袭击，为了做到丰产丰收，广大群众都夜以继日地抢割抢运。淮安县二十一万干部和群众突击抢收，经过六昼夜的奋战，全县二十多万亩中熟稻全部抢收登场，避免了芽烂损失。位于扬子江心的扬中县，在收割中稻的时候，每个公社的田埂和大路，都修得平平整整，社员们在挑运稻把上场时，做到“稻不拖地，穗不遗漏”，打谷时普遍做到边脱粒、边扫、边检查，老人和孩子们还组织了拾稻穗、拾稻粒的专业队，全县已拾了三万五千斤稻谷。
    各地在收割中出现了许多大面积丰产田。以生产中稻出名的江阴、靖江、扬中和高邮、盐城等县都分别比去年增产两成到三成。盐城县生产条件较差的潘黄公社也改变了过去的低产面貌，全社已经脱粒的一万八千亩中稻比去年增产五成以上。扬中县还出现了大批千斤田，全县十一个公社的中稻实收产量，都超过了原订包产指标。（附图片）
