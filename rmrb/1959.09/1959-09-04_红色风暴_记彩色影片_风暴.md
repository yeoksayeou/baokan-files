    Red Storm
    —On the Color Film "Storm"
　  By Our Reporter Zhu Jigong
    On the screen appears the scene of warlord melee more than thirty years ago, thick smoke billowing, beacon fires everywhere, a train speeding by… Tens of thousands of scantily clad, gaunt-faced disaster victims trudge along the railway line. This "Refugee Map" is the prelude to the "February 7th" Great Strike.

    The color film "Storm" has recently been previewed. This film was produced by the Beijing Film Studio, directed and written by Jin Shan, and photographed by Zhu Jinming. Through vivid images of the working class, highly generalized techniques, and a magnificent momentum, the director, writer, and all the creative staff have handled this theme of great historical significance—the Chinese working class, first appearing on the political stage, from initial awakening to organization, unleashing a red storm with irresistible force, demonstrating its irresistible power.

    Scene after scene shifts: The strike movement is surging, unstoppable. The sixteen branch trade unions, newly established along the Beijing-Hankou Railway line, are rapidly brewing the establishment of a general trade union. In Wu Peifu's residence, worker representatives Lin Xiangqian, Lao He, and Sun Yuliang, backed by tens of thousands of workers, engage in a face-to-face struggle with this warlord possessing an army of 300,000. Negotiations demanding the establishment of a general trade union break down, and the workers, with no turning back, a breathtaking battle scene unfolds: In front of Pule Garden in Zhengzhou, thousands upon thousands of workers, carrying a horizontal plaque reading "Beijing-Hankou Railway General Trade Union," charge forward barehanded against the bayonets of military police. Worker leader Lao He seizes a machine gun from the enemy, using armed struggle to oppose the counter-revolutionary armed forces. As the reactionary military police are routed, red flags flutter, drums and music resound, and the crowd roars inside Pule Garden. The inaugural meeting of the general trade union opens. The first battle is thus launched and won.

    This victory allows the worker movement and worker organizations to develop rapidly throughout the country. In subsequent struggles, the working class grows stronger, and countless heroic, resourceful, and indomitable advanced fighters emerge. The writer-director and actors of "Storm," through the portrayal of Sun Yuliang, an ordinary worker, reflect many of the excellent qualities of the working class. As soon as the workers turn the club into a trade union, the lackey Hu Datou, in the name of the French factory manager, threatens Sun Yuliang, wanting to deduct his wages and prevent him from joining the trade union. However, Sun Yuliang unexpectedly raises his fist, glares, and angrily says to him, "Do you recognize this one, go to hell with your French factory manager, you dog!"

    A lion in the face of the enemy, a docile tool in the face of the Party. Sun Yuliang's "secret oath of joining the Party" is a moving scene. This scene has only three or four lines of dialogue, but it portrays the image of an ordinary worker who is absolutely loyal to the Party. The camera whirrs, Zhang Ping, who plays Sun Yuliang, raises his left hand, his chest rises and falls rapidly, he swallows deeply, and facing the Party flag, says, "I am all yours, I will listen to you, follow you, and work hard for the working class..." The director says, "Good," and a difficult shot is filmed.

    "'The blood history of the February 7th tragedy remains, Wu and Xiao leave behind a stench for thousands of years, lawyers should uphold justice in the world, giving their lives to become martyrs whose names endure!'" These are the words inscribed by Comrade Dong Biwu on Shi Yang's tombstone in Wuhan. During the "February 7th" strike movement, revolutionary intellectuals further united with the working class. In "Storm," the voice and smile of the martyr Shi Yang, played by the famous actor Jin Shan, leave a deep impression. It is he who, under the leadership of the Party, generously upholds justice and travels around for the workers; it is he who, using his legitimate status as a lawyer, verbally attacks the enemy; and finally, he is fearless in the face of danger and bravely dies for the cause. Shi Yang's first appearance in the film is in the mass scene where the pseudo-police chief intends to murder the innocent worker Huang Defa on a pretext. At that critical moment, a middle-aged man in a long robe, full of righteous indignation, strides up the steps from the crowd. He uses a torrent of eloquence and righteous condemnation to denounce the enemy's shameful behavior, causing the pseudo-military police to panic and be embarrassed. The enemy with weapons is defeated by the unarmed working class. Shi Yang's monologue, which lasts for four minutes, is a rare "long shot" on the screen, but Jin Shan speaks with full passion, in one breath, his words sonorous and powerful, vividly reflecting the heroic spirit of this revolutionary fighter.

    When Shi Yang is at home drafting an announcement for the general trade union, the police come to arrest him. Shi Yang calmly burns the secret documents. His wife pulls at him, urging him to leave quickly, but he insists on not doing so. His wife pleads, "If not for yourself, you must think of the workers!" Shi Yang finally decisively says, "I'm leaving!" But he is eventually surrounded by military police on the roof. At this time, the north wind howls, and Shi Yang roars to the sky, "You can kill one Shi Yang, but you cannot kill millions upon millions of great people!"

    The outstanding leader of the worker movement, Lin Xiangqian, appears on the screen for the first time, played by Li Xiang. There are many shots in the film showing this leader's organizational talent and firm class position. He organizes the worker pickets, he represents 30,000 workers in negotiations with Wu Peifu, so steadfastly fighting for the establishment of the first organization of Chinese workers—the general trade union. The red storm begins, and it is he who fearlessly blows the whistle, announcing the general mobilization of the strike struggle.

    Lin Xiangqian is full of confidence in the future of the revolution. He talks to his wife Chen Guizhen (played by Tian Hua) about their soon-to-be-born child, saying, "Anyway, when they reach my age, they will have good days!" The day after saying this, he is arrested. Police Chief Wei Xueqing threatens Lin Xiangqian with a ghost-headed knife: "It's a matter of life and death, will you resume work or not?" Lin Xiangqian replies decisively: "The head can be cut off, blood can flow, but work will never be resumed!" Wei Xueqing strikes with his knife... Lin Xiangqian wakes up from the pool of blood, enduring great pain, shouting: "Our good China will be ruined by you warlords and capitalists. The 30,000 workers of the Beijing-Hankou Railway will not let it go, and the entire working class of the country will settle the blood debt with you!"

    The final moment arrives, and the martyr Lin Xiangqian bravely dies for the cause, amid the slogans of "Down with the warlords!" "Down with imperialism!" "Long live the working class!" Immediately after, worker masses rush forward one after another, carrying red flags and shouting slogans, continuing to throw themselves into the battle. One hero falls, and thousands of heroes stand up. Under the leadership of the Party, the revolutionary movement of the Chinese working class constantly advances from victory to victory!

    红色风暴
    ——记彩色影片“风暴”
　  本报记者　朱继功
    银幕上出现了三十多年前军阀混战的局面，浓烟迷漫，烽火遍野，列车在奔驰……，成千上万衣不蔽体、面容枯瘦的灾民，沿着铁路线跋涉着。这幅“流亡图”是彩色影片“风暴”的序幕，也是“二七”大罢工的前奏曲。
    彩色影片“风暴”最近试映了。这部影片由北京电影制片厂摄制，金山编导，朱今明摄影。编导和全体创作人员通过工人阶级鲜明的形象，高度概括的手法，雄伟的气势，处理了这个具有伟大历史意义的主题——第一次登上政治舞台的中国工人阶级由开始觉醒，到组织起来，以雷霆万钧之势掀起了红色的风暴，表现了不可抗拒的力量。
    一个个镜头在转换着：罢工运动风起云涌，势不可当。京汉铁路线上刚建立不久的十六个分工会，迅速酝酿成立总工会。在吴佩孚的寓所，以几万工人群众作后盾的工人代表林祥谦、老何和孙玉亮同这个拥有三十万大军的军阀展开了面对面的斗争。要求成立总工会的谈判决裂，工人们一不做，二不休，惊心动魄的战斗场面出现了：郑州普乐园前，千千万万打着“京汉铁路总工会”横匾的工人们，赤手空拳迎着军警的刺刀冲上前去。工人领袖老何从敌人手里夺过机枪，用武装斗争反对反革命的武装。当反动军警们纷纷溃退的时候，普乐园内，红旗翻滚，鼓乐喧天，人声鼎沸，总工会成立大会开幕了。第一个战斗就是这样打响了，胜利了。
    这个胜利，使各地工人运动和工人组织迅速发展起来。在以后的斗争里，工人阶级日益壮大，出现了无数英勇、机智、顽强不屈的先进战士。“风暴”的编导和演员通过塑造孙玉亮这个普通工人的形象，反映了工人阶级许多优秀的品质。工人们刚把俱乐部改成工会，狗腿子胡大头以法国厂长的名义威胁孙玉亮，要克扣他的工资，不许他搞工会。但是，孙玉亮出乎意料地扬起大拳，瞪着眼睛，愤怒地对他说：“你认识老子这个吗，去你妈的法国厂长吧，狗！”
    在敌人面前是一头雄狮，在党的面前是驯顺的工具。孙玉亮“入党秘密宣誓”是一个动人的场面。这场戏，只有三四句台词，但是刻划了对党坚贞不二的一个普通工人的形象，摄影机轧轧地响了起来，饰演孙玉亮的张平举起左手，胸脯急遽地起伏着，深深地咽了一口唾沫，面对着党旗说：“我整个都是你的，我听你的话，跟你跑，替工人阶级卖命……”导演说，“好”，一个难演的镜头拍摄下来了。
    “二七工仇血史留，吴萧贻臭万千秋，律师应仗人间义，身殉名存烈士俦！”这是董必武同志在武汉施洋墓碑上题的词句。在“二七”罢工运动中，革命的知识分子进一步同工人阶级结合起来。在“风暴”中，由著名的演员金山扮演的施洋烈士的音容笑貌，给人留下了深刻的印象。是他，在党的领导下慷慨仗义，为工人四处奔波；是他，利用律师的合法地位，对敌人口诛笔伐；最后，他临危不惧，英勇就义。施洋在影片中第一次露面，是在伪警察处长打算借故谋杀无辜工人黄德发的群众场面上。在那千钧一发的时刻，人丛中一个身穿长袍、正义凛然的中年人，昂首阔步登上了台阶，他用直泻千里、义正词严的雄辩申斥了敌人的可耻行为，使伪军警们张惶失措，窘态百出，手持武器的敌人被手无寸铁的工人阶级战败了。施洋这场独白，长达四分钟，是银幕中少见的“长镜头”，可是金山满腔激情，一口气地说下去，字字铿锵，句句有力，把施洋这个革命志士的雄伟气魄，逼真地反映出来。
    当施洋在家里正为总工会起草文告的时候，警察来逮捕他。施洋从容地把秘密文件烧掉，他的夫人扯着让他赶快走，他执意不肯，夫人又恳求道：“就不为你自己，也得为工人们着想啊！”，施洋这才决然地说：“我走！”但是他终于在屋顶上被军警包围了。这时朔风怒号，施洋仰天长啸：“你们杀了一个施洋，却杀不了几百万万伟大的民众！”
    工人运动出色的领袖林祥谦第一次出现在银幕上，他是由李翔扮演的。影片中有许多镜头表现了这个领袖的组织才能和坚定的阶级立场。他组织了工人纠察队，他代表三万工人同吴佩孚谈判，是那样坚定不移地为成立中国工人第一个组织——总工会而斗争。红色风暴开始了，也是他大无畏地拉响了汽笛，宣布罢工斗争总动员。
    林祥谦对革命前途充满了信心，他同妻子陈桂贞（由田华饰）谈起他们即将降临的孩子时说：“反正他们这一辈，到了我这个岁数就有好日子过了！”说过这话的第二天，他被逮捕了。警务处长魏学清手执鬼头刀威胁林祥谦：“千钧一发了，到底复工不复工”林祥谦斩钉截铁地回答说：“头可断，血可流，决不复工！”魏学清猛砍一刀……林祥谦从血泊中醒过来，忍着巨大的痛苦高喊道：“我们好好的中国就断送在你们军阀、资本家的手里，京汉铁路三万工人不会干休，全国工人阶级要跟你们算血账！”
    最后的时刻到了，林祥谦烈士在“打倒军阀！”“打倒帝国主义！”“工人阶级万岁！”的口号声中英勇就义。紧接着，银幕上前继后扑的工人群众打着红旗，高呼口号继续投入了战斗。一个英雄倒下去，千万个英雄站了起来。中国工人阶级的革命运动，在党的领导下，不断地从胜利走向胜利！
