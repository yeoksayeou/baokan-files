Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai's 400,000 textile workers, who have been overfulfilling their plans every month, have enthusiastically responded to the Beijing textile workers' initiative to launch an inter-factory friendship competition by holding meetings and discussions to propose conditions.

Their conditions for accepting the challenge are: For cotton yarn production, 180,000 bales will be produced in September, an increase of 14% compared to August; in the fourth quarter, in addition to guaranteeing the completion of the national plan of 570,000 bales, another 50,000 bales will be produced; and the annual national plan will be completed ten days ahead of schedule. For cotton cloth production, 134 million meters will be produced in September; and the annual national plan will be completed seven days ahead of schedule. Other printed and dyed fabrics, wool fabrics, woolen yarn, silk fabrics, and cotton knitwear yarn will all be completed thirty to thirty-five days ahead of the annual national plan.

In terms of product quality, it is proposed that the standard product rate of cotton yarn should reach 99%, producing more premium yarn; the first-class product rate of cotton cloth should reach 97%, and the first-class product rate of printing and dyeing and worsted wool fabrics should reach 98%; the first-class product rate of silk fabrics should reach 90%.

A total of 7,000 new products are to be trial-produced throughout the year. From January to August, more than 4,000 new products with novel patterns and unique color schemes have been trial-produced. In the four months from September to December, more than 2,000 more pieces will be trial-produced, and it will be guaranteed that 35% of the new products can be put into production.

It is required to save 21,000 piculs of cotton, 100,000 kilograms of wool, 46.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 62,200 tons of coal throughout the year.

Shanghai textile workers had a successful start in early September, with cotton yarn production from the 1st to the 5th completing 103.6% of the planned target and quality completing 102.5% of the planned target. At present, the textile workers are launching a vigorous and down-to-earth new upsurge of socialist labor competition for high yield, high quality, and strict economy, determined to greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day with new achievements in realizing the competition targets.

This newspaper reports that, encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers of Fuxin City have further boosted their energy, and with a tenacious fighting spirit, have won a comprehensive victory on the industrial front in early September. Coal mines, power plants, railway transportation, and local industries have all overfulfilled their plans, creating unprecedented achievements of a good start, red every day.

The comprehensive overfulfillment of the plan in early September is a new phenomenon that has never occurred in Fuxin City in the past. In early September, the Fuxin Mining Bureau's increased production plan was to produce 600,000 tons of coal, with an average daily plan more than 10,000 tons higher than the annual plan level, but the 60,000 miners were even more energetic and overfulfilled the task by more than 2,000 tons. In early September, the mining bureau averaged 60,221 tons per day, more than 11,000 tons per day compared with the entire month of August, and more than 23,000 tons per day compared with early August. At the same time, production preparation work has also been greatly strengthened, with mine tunneling overfulfilling the plan by 11%, an increase of 39% compared to early August; open-pit stripping did not complete the plan due to four days of rain in early September, but it increased by 77% compared to early August; mechanical maintenance work has also been greatly strengthened. The power generation of the Fuxin Power Plant exceeded the plan by 5.2%, generating 3.54 million kilowatt-hours more, and the coal consumption rate was lower than the average figure of August (0.45 kg), using only 0.447 kg of coal per kilowatt-hour generated, saving 387 tons of coal compared to the plan, creating the plant's lowest coal consumption record in history. The proportion of mixed burning of inferior coal increased from 14% last month to 24.1%, greatly saving good coal. Railway transportation overfulfilled the loading plan in early September, with 38 Red Flag trains (15 in early August) and 53 direct trains (33 in early August), and the net weight per vehicle increased by 0.8 tons. The total output value of local industry also overfulfilled the plan for early September by 4%.

This is a great victory for the workers of Fuxin City in responding to the Party's call and opposing right-leaning tendencies to boost their energy.

At the end of August, the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee proposed the call for "a good start, red every day, red every ten days, and a complete victory for the whole month, completing the September plan ahead of schedule to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Day," and a vigorous upsurge in the movement to increase production and conserve resources was launched throughout the city.

Now, the broad masses of workers in Fuxin City are advancing victoriously, determined to overproduce 1.8 million tons of coal in September, complete the third quarter plan six days ahead of schedule, complete the national plan for this year nineteen days ahead of schedule, and increase coal production by 1 million tons throughout the year; the workers of the Fuxin Power Plant will generate more electricity with less coal while ensuring safety, generate 10 to 20 million kilowatt-hours more this year, and at the same time accelerate the construction of new generators, and strive to complete the installation of a 100,000 kilowatt large-scale generator ahead of schedule in December this year; railway transportation will reduce the daily time for one operation to less than 5.5 hours and increase the turnover efficiency of the skin car.

    上海纺织工人掀起高产优质竞赛
    保质保量提前完成计划
    阜新九月上旬挖煤发电运输满堂红
    新华社上海讯　今年以来月月超额完成计划的上海四十万纺织工人，看到北京纺织工人提出开展厂际友谊竞赛的倡议以后，纷纷开会座谈，提出条件，热烈响应。
    他们应战的条件是：棉纱产量，9月份生产十八万件，比8月份增加14％；第四季度在保证完成国家计划五十七万件的基础上，再增产五万件；提前十天完成全年国家计划。棉布产量，9月份生产一亿三千四百万米；提前七天完成全年国家计划。其他印染布、毛织品、毛线、丝织品、针棉织用纱等，都要提前三十天到三十五天完成全年国家计划。
    在产品质量方面，提出棉纱标准品率要达到99％，生产更多的优级纱；棉布正品率达到97％，印染和精纺毛织品正品率达到98％；丝织品正品率达到90％。
    全年共要试制出新产品七千件。1月到8月份已试制出四千多种花型新颖、配色别致的新产品，在9月到12月四个月中，要再试制二千多件，并保证有35％的新产品能投入生产。
    全年要求节约用棉二万一千市担，节约用毛十万公斤，节约用电四千六百五十万度，节约用煤六万二千二百吨。
    上海纺织工人们9月初又旗开得胜，1日至5日的棉纱产量完成计划指标103.6％，质量完成计划指标102.5％。目前，纺织工人们正在掀起轰轰烈烈踏踏实实的高产优质、厉行节约的社会主义劳动竞赛新高潮，决心以实现竞赛指标的新成绩，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    本报讯　在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下，阜新市职工进一步鼓足干劲，以顽强的战斗精神，赢得了9月上旬工业战线的全面胜利。煤矿、发电厂、铁路运输、地方工业都超额完成计划，创造了开门红、日日红的空前成绩。
    全面超额完成上旬计划，这是阜新市历年来没有的新气象。上旬，阜新矿务局的增产计划是产煤六十万吨，平均日计划比年计划水平高一万多吨，但是六万矿工的干劲更高，超额两千多吨完成了任务。上旬这个矿务局平均日产六万零二百二十一吨，和8月全月相比每天多出煤一万一千多吨，和8月上旬相比，每天多出煤两万三千多吨。同时生产准备工作也大大加强，矿井掘进超额11％完成计划，比8月上旬提高39％；露天剥离由于上旬有四天下雨没完成计划，但比8月上旬提高了77％；机械检修工作也有很大加强。阜新发电厂发电量超过计划5.2％，多发电三百五十四万度，煤耗率比8月的平均数字（零点四五公斤）有降低，每发一度电只用煤零点四四七公斤，比计划节约煤三百八十七吨，创造了该厂有史以来用煤最少的纪录。掺烧劣煤由上月的14％增加到24.1％，大大节约了好煤。铁路运输超额完成了上旬的装车计划，开出红旗列车三十八列（8月上旬是十五列），直达列车五十三列（8月上旬是三十三列），净载重每车提高零点八吨。地方工业总产值也超额4％完成了上旬计划。
    这是阜新市职工响应党的号召，反右倾鼓干劲取得的伟大胜利。
    中共阜新市委8月末提出“开门红、日日红、旬旬红、全月满堂红，提前完成9月份计划向国庆十周年献礼”的号召，全市就轰轰烈烈地掀起了新增产节约运动的高潮。
    现在，阜新市广大职工正在乘胜前进，决心在9月份超额生产一百八十万吨煤，提前六天完成第三季度计划，提前十九天完成今年国家计划，全年增产煤炭一百万吨；阜新发电厂职工要在保证安全条件下少烧煤多发电，今年多发电一千到两千万度，同时还要加快新发电机的建设任务，争取提前在今年12月完成十万瓩大型发电机安装任务；铁路运输要把一次作业日间压缩到五点五小时以下，增加皮车周转效率。
