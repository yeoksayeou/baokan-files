Xinhua News Agency, 14th. The competition activities of the First National Games of the People's Republic of China, an unprecedented event in the history of Chinese sports, fully unfolded today. Approximately six hundred matches were held at dozens of sports venues in the capital. The weather was sunny this morning, turning cloudy and rainy in the afternoon, but most of the events proceeded as scheduled.

In today's competitions, two national swimming records and one national new achievement were broken. Furthermore, many newcomers defeated veteran athletes.

In the swimming competition, the national records were broken by Dai Lihua from Shanghai (women's 100-meter freestyle in 1 minute 8.6 seconds) and Chen Yunpeng from Shanghai (men's 100-meter butterfly in 1 minute 4 seconds).

At the Guanyuan Stadium, fifteen athletes surpassed the national best result of 94 points in the men's 90-meter archery event, set by Shanghai athlete Zhang Langshui at the National Archery Championships in May of this year. Among them, Han Youlu, a Hui athlete from the Qinghai Province delegation, achieved the best score of 142 points.

The most lively of all the ball games: table tennis team preliminaries, volleyball, badminton, tennis, baseball, water polo, etc., all kicked off today. Forty table tennis team preliminary matches were held today, and all seeded teams, both men's and women's, were victorious. It is worth noting that Qiu Zhonghui, a Beijing player known for her fierce attacking style, lost to Yang Qiwen from Sichuan with a score of 0 to 2 in the team competition.

Twelve volleyball finals were held today. The competition was exceptionally intense. The 1958 Men's League Champion, the People's Liberation Army team, and the runner-up, the Guangdong team, were surprisingly defeated by the relatively unknown Jiangxi team and Liaoning team, respectively.

The basketball tournament has already entered its sixth round today, and the second stage of the soccer tournament saw four matches.

Track and field, the lightest weight class of weightlifting, and radio competitions were also held today.

The radio telegraphy competition held its first sending contest, including sending long codes, short codes, and character codes. Participants, wearing headphones and pressing the telegraph key with their right hand, rapidly transmitted the code. As the continuous "da-da-da-da" sound reverberated, the paper strip on the ripple machine recorded the code ripple symbols, and the referees used stopwatches to calculate the score every five minutes. The sending results will be determined the next day. This competition will last for twelve days and is scheduled to end on the 25th.

Despite the continuous autumn rain, the open-air Beihai Stadium was packed, and the capital's audience enthusiastically braved the rain to appreciate the exciting Chinese-style wrestling competitions conducted by outstanding wrestlers from all over the country. A total of eighty-five preliminary matches were held today, with one hundred and seventy-two athletes participating. When the wrestling newcomers - Lazimaimaiti from the Xinjiang delegation (lightest weight class) and Kong Jiquan from Shanxi - engaged in an exciting and varied contest, the audience repeatedly responded with enthusiastic applause. In the end, Lazimaimaiti won with a score of 16 to 8.

At the Cultural Palace of the Working People, sixty outstanding chess players from twenty-eight provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country began their matches. In the Chinese chess competition, 53-year-old veteran Wu Yanfu from Gansu engaged in a fierce battle with renowned Beijing player Hou Yushan for over forty rounds in the first round. Hou Yushan ultimately could not withstand the sharp attacks of Wu's "chariot," "horse," and "cannon" and was defeated. In the second round in the afternoon, Wu Yanfu and Li Yiting from Hubei put on an exciting display, ultimately resulting in a draw.

In addition, Chen Tiancai from Shandong drew with Yang Guanlin from Guangdong, while Liu Yici from Zhejiang and He Shunan from Shanghai were also forced to draws by Zhao Zhenhuan from Jilin and Ma Kuan from Ningxia, respectively.

The Beijing Institute of Physical Education competition area of the National Games also held freestyle wrestling exhibition matches, Greco-Roman wrestling exhibition matches, and fencing exhibition matches. In the matches, Greco-Roman wrestling athlete Chen Fude (Beijing), in the lightest weight class, was defeated by newcomer Xuan Chengfan (Jilin). Freestyle wrestling athlete Yuan Dacai (Shanghai), in the lightweight class, drew with newcomer Kuku Le (Xinjiang).

At the Shichahai Gymnasium, one hundred and twenty-nine gymnastics athletes from seventeen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions began to show their skills. Accompanied by music, they competed today in prescribed routines for three events: women's free gymnastics, women's individual routines, and men's pair routines, and also performed part of the prescribed routines for two events: men's free gymnastics and team routines.

At the western suburbs shooting range, crisp gunfire echoed from as early as 7:30 am. Today, 252 shooters simultaneously participated in four events across five ranges: slow fire with a self-selected .22 caliber handgun at 50 meters with sixty bullets, prone, kneeling, and standing shooting with a military rifle at 300 meters with sixty bullets, running deer single-shot shooting with a self-selected rifle at a distance of 100 meters for fifty times, and shotgun skeet shooting with one hundred clay targets. Shotgun skeet shooting was divided into four groups, with each group shooting at twenty-five clay targets. Lu Liansheng, a 21-year-old youth shooter from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region delegation, and Ma Fengchang from the Liaoning Province delegation achieved excellent scores with all targets hit.

At Liangxiang Airport, the Group B gliding competition began today. It was temporarily halted later due to rain. The competition item is winch-launched rectangular circuit take-off and landing with primary and intermediate gliders. A total of eighty-six athletes participated in this event, including thirteen female athletes. Most of them are newcomers who had only recently started learning to glide, but many handled the gliders relatively smoothly and skillfully in today's competition.

    全国运动会各项竞赛活动全面展开
    打破两项游泳全国纪录　创造一项射箭新成绩
    据新华社14日讯　我国体育史上规模空前的中华人民共和国第一届运动会的竞赛活动，今天全面展开。在首都几十个运动场地上进行了约六百场比赛。今天上午天气晴朗，下午转阴雨，但是，绝大部分项目的比赛仍照常举行。
    在今天比赛中，共打破了两项游泳全国纪录和一项全国新成绩。并且出现了许多新手打败老将的情况。
    在游泳比赛中，打破全国纪录的是上海选手戴丽华（女子百米自由泳一分八秒六）和上海选手陈运鹏（男子百米蝶泳一分四秒）。
    在官园体育场，有十五名运动员刷新了上海运动员张浪水今年5月在全国射箭锦标赛中所创造的男子九十米射准九十四分的全国最新成绩。其中，青海省代表队回族运动员韩有禄成绩最好，是一百四十二分。
    最热闹的各项球类比赛：乒乓球团体预赛、排球、羽毛球、网球、棒球、水球等都在今天揭开战幕。乒乓球团体预赛今天进行了四十场，男女种子队全部获胜。值得注意的是，以攻球凶猛凌厉的北京选手丘钟惠，在团体赛中，曾以○比二败给了四川选手杨棋文。
    排球决赛今天进行了十二场。比赛进行得异常激烈。1958年男子甲级队联赛冠军解放军队和亚军广东队竟分别败给不大闻名的江西队和辽宁队。
    篮球赛今天已经进入第六轮，足球赛第二段比赛今天进行了四场。
    今天还进行了田径、最轻量级举重和无线电比赛。
    无线电收发报竞赛进行了第一项发报竞赛，共有拍发长码、短码和字码三个项目。参加竞赛的选手，戴着耳机，右手按着电键，飞快地拍发电码。随着连续不断的哒哒哒哒声，波纹机上的纸条便记录出电码波纹符号，裁判员拿着秒表计算着每五分钟的成绩。发报成绩要到次日确定。这次竞赛将举行十二天，预定到25日结束。
    尽管秋雨淅沥地下个不停，露天的北海体育场坐无虚席，首都的观众今天以浓烈的兴趣冒雨欣赏了来自祖国各地优秀摔跤手进行的精彩的中国式摔跤竞赛。今天一共进行了八十五场预赛，有一百七十二名运动员参加比赛。当摔跤场上的新手——新疆代表队最轻级的拉子买买提和山西孔吉全进行精彩百出的竞赛时，观众一再报以热烈的掌声。最后拉子买买提以十六比八的优势取得了胜利。
    在劳动人民文化宫，参加棋类竞赛的来自全国二十八个省、市、自治区的六十名优秀棋类选手开始对弈。在中国象棋赛中甘肃五十三岁老将武延福第一轮同北京著名选手侯玉山激战四十余回合。侯玉山终挡不住武“车”“马”“炮”的锐利攻势而遭败局。下午第二轮武延福与湖北李义庭比赛中，双方对弈精彩纷呈，最后下成和局。
    此外，山东陈天才战和广东杨官璘，浙江刘忆慈、上海何顺安也都分别被吉林赵振寰、宁夏马宽所迫和。
    全运会北京体育学院竞赛区还进行了自由式摔跤表演赛、古典式摔跤表演赛，击剑表演赛。在比赛中，古典式摔跤运动健将最轻级陈福德（北京）被新手玄成范（吉林）战败。自由式摔跤运动健将轻量级袁大才（上海）与新手苦库勒（新疆）战成平手。

    在西郊射击场上，从清早七时半就传出了清脆的枪声。今天，有二百五十二名射手分别在五个靶场上，同时进行自选小口径手枪五十米六十发子弹慢射、军用步枪三百米六十发子弹卧跪立射、自选步枪一百米距离对跑鹿单发射击五十次、猎枪对飞蝶射击一百个蝶靶共四个项目。猎枪对飞蝶射击分四组进行，每组射二十五个蝶靶。广西僮族自治区代表队二十一岁的青年射手吕连生和辽宁省代表队的马凤昌获得全部命中的优异成绩。
    在良乡飞机场，乙组滑翔竞赛今天开始举行。后来因雨临时停止。这次竞赛项目是初级、中级滑翔机绞盘车牵引矩形航线起落飞行。参加这个项目的运动员共有八十六名，其中有十三名女运动员。他们大都是不久前才开始学习滑翔的新手，但是许多人在今天的比赛中操纵都比较平稳，熟练。
