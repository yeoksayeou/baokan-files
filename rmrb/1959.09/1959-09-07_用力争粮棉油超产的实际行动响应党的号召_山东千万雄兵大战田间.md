Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 5th: The Communique and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have greatly inspired the members of the People's Communes in Shandong Province. Tens of millions of brave men and women throughout the province are stationed and deployed to vigorously battle in the fields, striving for increased production of grain, cotton, and oil, and responding to the Party's call with practical actions of overproduction plans.

In recent days, from the special districts and counties to the communes and teams, all regions have held mass rallies of thousands or tens of thousands of people, exploring potential, finding measures, and increasing production targets. The People's Communes in the Liaocheng Special District, located in the western Shandong Plain, have decided to increase the district's grain production by another 1 billion catties on the basis of the original target of 7 billion catties. More than 3.15 million members are currently working hard to strengthen autumn field management. Chiping County plans to complete fertilization, watering, and soil cultivation of 400,000 mu of sweet potatoes and fertilization, pest control, and mid-tillage of 170,000 mu of late corn within three to five days, striving to increase production by 50 catties per mu. The 75 activists of the Nanzhu Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Liaocheng City have established a temporary field canteen and are stationed in the fields. Currently, from August 26th to 30th, Liaocheng Special District has fertilized, watered, hoed, and cultivated 2.67 million mu of sweet potatoes, 2.63 million mu of corn, 1.39 million mu of soybeans, and 2.46 million mu of cotton.

The leading organs of the Changwei Special District in central Shandong put forward the call to carry out a late autumn crop fertilization blitz week, vigorously grasp field management, and strive to increase autumn crop production by 20 to 30 percent. The communes throughout the district immediately became a scene of activity. The Caijiazhuang Production Team of the Wutai Commune in Shouguang County put forward the "Five Comparisons" conditions: compare listening to the Party, compare the quality of agricultural work, compare production measures, compare the completion of plans, and compare the work style of cadres, and launched a competition with the teams throughout the commune. Currently, this area is filled with red flags during the day and red lights all over the slopes at night, setting off a new high tide of production. By August 29th, the daily progress of fertilization had rapidly increased from 160,000 mu before the communique was announced to 526,000 mu. Wulian County, which has made rapid progress, completed the fertilization task of 156,000 mu of sweet potatoes in four days with over 80,000 laborers. Pingdu County has fertilized more than 870,000 mu of sweet potatoes, accounting for 97.3% of the total sweet potato area.

The Yantai Special District, which suffered relatively little drought this year, revised its production targets and increased its measures after resolutely overcoming the right-leaning emotions of some cadres and thoroughly breaking the "harvest is a foregone conclusion" theory. Currently, activities to strive for a greater harvest have been carried out from points to areas. In Songcun Commune, Yantai City, 15,000 men and women completed the fertilization of more than 20,000 mu of sweet potatoes in three days. After overcoming complacency and slackness, the cadres of the Chengxiang Commune in Weihai City led all commune members to fertilize 3,000 mu of sweet potatoes and peanuts and 910 mu of autumn corn in seven days.

The Heze area and the Yimeng Mountains, which were more severely affected by the drought, launched a fertilization and replanting campaign to make up for the losses caused by the disaster. The communes in Chengwu County have fertilized more than 358,700 mu of late autumn crops and replanted more than 10,000 mu of autumn vegetables. In Juancheng County, 150,000 people are battling in the fields. Statistics for August 27th alone show that more than 74,000 mu of autumn vegetables were replanted and more than 94,000 carts of fertilizer were accumulated.

    用力争粮棉油超产的实际行动响应党的号召
    山东千万雄兵大战田间
    新华社济南5日电　党的八届八中全会公报和决议大大鼓舞了山东省各人民公社社员，全省数以千万计的雄兵勇将扎营摆阵大战田间，奋力争取粮棉油增产，用超产计划的实际行动响应党的号召。
    这些天来，各地区从专区、县到社、队，纷纷召开万人千人的誓师大会，挖潜力、找措施，加大增产指标。位于鲁西平原聊城专区的人民公社，决定全区在原订产粮七十亿斤的基础上，再增产十亿斤。三百一十五万多名社员，目前正大力加强秋田管理。茌平县计划在三五天内，对四十万亩地瓜追肥、浇水和培土一遍；在五天内对十七万亩晚玉米追肥、治虫、中耕一次，争取每亩增产五十斤。聊城市城关公社南朱大队的七十五名积极分子成立了临时田间食堂，在田间安营扎寨。目前，聊城专区从8月26日到30日，已有二百六十七万亩地瓜、二百六十三万亩玉米、一百三十九万多亩大豆、二百四十六万亩棉花进行了追肥、浇水、锄草和培土。
    地处鲁中的昌潍专区的领导机关提出开展一个晚秋作物追肥突击周，狠抓田间管理、争取秋作物增产二到三成的号召后，全区各公社立即沸腾起来，寿光县五台公社蔡家庄生产队提出比听党的话、比农活质量、比生产措施、比完成计划、比干部作风的“五比”条件，和全社各队展开竞赛。目前这个地区白天红旗遍野，夜晚满坡红灯，掀起了新的生产高潮。到8月29日，追肥日进度已由公报公布前的十六万亩迅速增加到五十二点六万亩。进展较快的五莲县的八万多名劳动大军，苦战四天完成了十五万六千亩的地瓜追肥任务。平度县已有八十七万多亩地瓜追了肥，占地瓜总面积的97.3％。
    今年遭受干旱较轻的烟台专区，在坚决克服一部分干部的右倾情绪，大破“丰收定局”论以后，修订了生产指标，增加了措施。目前争取更大丰收的活动已由点到面地开展起来。烟台市宋村公社一万五千个男女劳力，三天就完成两万多亩地瓜追肥。威海市城厢公社的干部克服了自满松劲情绪后，领导全体社员七天给三千亩地瓜、花生，九百一十亩秋玉米追了肥。
    受旱较重的菏泽地区、沂蒙山区，为弥补因灾减产的损失，展开了追肥、抢种运动。成武县各公社已向晚秋作物追肥三十五万八千七百多亩，抢种秋菜一万多亩。鄄城县有十五万人大战田间，仅8月27日一天统计，就抢种秋菜七万四千多亩，积肥九万四千多车。
