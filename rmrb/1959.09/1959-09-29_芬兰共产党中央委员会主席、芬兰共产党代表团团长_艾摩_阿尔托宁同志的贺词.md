Comrades,

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Finland and all members of the Communist Party of Finland, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and respect to the Chinese people and their wise leader, the Communist Party of China, who are celebrating the tenth anniversary of their liberation.

The strong and courageous liberation struggle of the Chinese people has always aroused sympathy and admiration among the people of our country. The news of your victory that reached Finland ten years ago was a very pleasant message for the working people of our country. Even ordinary families understand that the fact that hundreds of millions of people have embarked on the road to socialism is a major historical event.

The achievements of the People's Republic of China in increasing production and improving the material and cultural life of the people are enormous. If you call your last year the "Year of the Great Leap Forward," then your past ten years can also be called the leap forward of a giant. Only a people led by a Communist Party that firmly stands on the Marxist-Leninist position can achieve such great achievements.

The growth of the strength of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the entire socialist camp, and the efforts of all peace defenders have opened up new prospects for eliminating the Cold War and easing international tensions.

The Finnish people, who have suffered from the disasters of imperialist wars, are happy to welcome all achievements that can consolidate peace between the peoples of all countries. The Finnish people, as neighbors of the great Soviet Union, are more aware than ever of the benefits of peaceful coexistence. According to the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between Finland and the Soviet Union, economic and cultural exchanges between our two peoples are becoming more and more active, which is beneficial to the Finnish people who have suffered from unemployment and other economic difficulties. Due to the demands of our people, our government also supports the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The attempts of those reactionaries who want to change our current foreign policy have also been defeated in the face of the Finnish people's will for peace.

As I now, on behalf of the Communist Party of Finland, congratulate the Chinese people on the constant emergence of new achievements, I believe that more and more people in our country will agree with the words of Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China: "The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind!"

Long live the People's Republic of China, which is ten years old!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live peace! (Attached picture)

### 芬兰共产党中央委员会主席、芬兰共产党代表团团长  艾摩·阿尔托宁同志的贺词

    芬兰共产党中央委员会主席、芬兰共产党代表团团长
    艾摩·阿尔托宁同志的贺词亲爱的同志们：
    我代表芬兰共产党中央委员会，芬兰共产党全体党员，向正在庆祝解放十周年的中国人民及其英明的领导者——中国共产党，致以衷心的祝贺和敬意。
    中国人民坚强、勇敢的解放斗争，在我国人民中一向引起同情和景仰。十年前传到芬兰来的关于你们胜利的消息，对我国的劳动人民说来，也是一个非常愉快的消息。即使是普通的家庭，也懂得有几亿人民走上了社会主义的道路，这是一个重大的历史事件。
    中华人民共和国在提高生产、人民的物质和文化生活方面的成就是巨大的。如果把你们去年的一年叫做“大跃进年”的话，那末也可以把你们过去的十年叫做巨人的跃进。只有坚决站在马克思列宁主义立场的共产党所领导下的人民，才有可能取得这样伟大的成就。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、整个社会主义阵营力量的壮大，以及全体和平保卫者的努力，为消除冷战和缓和国际紧张局势展开了新的远景。
    曾经遭受了帝国主义战争灾难的芬兰人民，愉快地欢迎一切足以巩固各国人民之间和平的成就。作为伟大苏联邻居的芬兰人民，比过去任何时候都更了解到和平共处的好处。根据芬兰和苏联订立的关于友好、合作、互助的条约，我们两国人民之间的经济、文化交流越来越活跃起来了，这对受过失业和其他经济困难的芬兰人民是有利的。由于我国人民的要求，我国政府也拥护恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。要想改变我国现行的外交方针的那些反动派的企图，在我国人民和平意志的面前也遭到了失败。
    当我现在代表芬兰共产党向中国人民祝贺不断出现的新的成就的时候，我相信在我国有越来越多的人民群众会同意中国共产党主席毛泽东同志的话：“东风压倒西风”！
    已满十岁的中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    和平万岁！（附图片）
