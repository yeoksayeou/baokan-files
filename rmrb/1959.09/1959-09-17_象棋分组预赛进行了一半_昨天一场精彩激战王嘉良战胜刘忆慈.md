The Xiangqi group preliminaries of the National Games are now halfway through.

Yesterday, in a wonderful battle, Wang Jialiang defeated Liu Yici.

(Xinhua News Agency, 16th) The Chinese Xiangqi group preliminaries of the National Games have now completed the third and fourth rounds of competition today, meaning half of the rounds are finished, and the battles are entering a tense stage. A total of twenty-six people are participating in the Chinese Xiangqi competition, divided into four groups for the preliminaries. According to regulations, only two people from each group can advance after the preliminaries, for a total of eight people who can participate in the finals starting on the 20th. Therefore, every game in the preliminaries is of great importance.

Today there were a total of twelve matches, and all the battles were very fierce. In the first group, last year's national champion, Li Yiting, lost a game to Wang Jiayuan of Hebei on the 15th. Today, when facing Lin Cailiang of Guizhou, he was very careful, considering every move thoroughly, not daring to slacken in the slightest, because if he lost another game, advancing would become a big problem. Today, their game lasted for three hours before Li Yiting broke through Lin Cailiang's tenacious entanglement and won. In the second group, He Shunan and Wang Qingjie of Shanxi played against each other today. Both were cautious, attacking and defending, so the game lasted from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM without a winner being decided, and they had to temporarily seal the game to continue in the afternoon. In the third group, there was a wonderful battle today, with Liu Yici of Zhejiang losing to Wang Jialiang of Heilongjiang. In the fourth group, Yang Guanlin met Meng Liguo of Liaoning today. These two experts showed their skills, and although Yang Guanlin had the advantage of moving first, the game ended in a draw.

Since the start of the chess competition, two games were sealed on the first day, one game was sealed on the second day, and today there were as many as three games sealed in the morning without a winner being decided, which also shows the increasing intensity of the chess battles.

    象棋分组预赛进行了一半
    昨天一场精彩激战王嘉良战胜刘忆慈
    据新华社16日讯　全国运动会的中国象棋分组预赛今天已进行了第三、第四轮比赛，即已轮赛完了一半，战斗开始进入紧张阶段。参加中国象棋比赛的共有二十六人，分四组进行预赛。按照规定，每组经过预赛后只有两个人出围，共八个人可以参加20日起的决赛；因此预赛的每一局棋，关系都十分重大。
    今天共有十二局对垒，战斗都十分激烈。在第一组中，去年全国冠军李义庭在15日输给了河北王家元一局后，今天在与贵州林才良对局时十分小心，每一着棋都经过周密的考虑，丝毫不敢懈慢，因为如果再输一局，出围就将大成问题。今天他们两人的一局棋共走了三个小时，李义庭才打破林才良的苦缠获胜。在第二组里的何顺安今天与山西王庆杰对局，两人走来都小心翼翼，都是攻中有守，守中有攻，因而这一局棋从上午八点走到十一点半还未分胜负，只好暂行封局，到下午继续进行。第三组里今天发生了一场精彩的激战，浙江刘忆慈败给黑龙江王嘉良，第四组的杨官璘今天碰上辽宁孟立国，这两位好手下来具见工夫，杨官璘虽得先走之利，但结果还是以和棋终局。
    棋赛开始以来，第一天有两盘棋封局，第二天一盘棋封局，今天多到三盘棋在上午未分胜负封局，这也可见棋战逐渐激烈的一斑。
