Taking Steel as the Key Link, Carrying Out Collaborative Competition
Leap Forward on All Fronts in the Industrial, Transportation, and Commercial Sectors of the Leshan Special District

Chengdu, September 22nd (reported by this newspaper) – An even more vigorous and wider-ranging comprehensive collaborative competition, taking steel as the key link, is unfolding with great momentum in the Leshan Special District of Sichuan. At present, the units participating in the collaborative competition throughout the district have expanded from the original nineteen units in steel, coal, coking, mining, and transportation, to tens of thousands of workers in thirty-three units including machinery, electricity, chemical industry, commerce, postal and telecommunications, and grain.

In March of this year, in order to realize a leap forward on all fronts with steel as the key link, the Leshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized the relevant industrial and transportation enterprises around steel production, conducting comprehensive collaborative competitions in paired zones. Practice over the past six months has proven that this is an effective method for promoting mutual cooperation and joint leap forward on all fronts. Recently, the Prefectural Committee and various factories, mines, and enterprises, in accordance with the requirements of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward development situation, expanded the industries participating in the comprehensive competition and further strengthened the organization and leadership of the competition movement. Joint offices were established in the collaboration zones, and a system of inspection, evaluation, and information exchange was established.

The development of the comprehensive collaborative competition with steel as the key link has eliminated the situation of mutual isolation between enterprises, established the view of taking steel as the key link and regarding the whole country as a single chessboard, and created a new atmosphere of mutual support to jointly ensure the completion of production tasks. In mid-August, according to weather forecasts of continuous heavy rain, in order to ensure that materials would not be lost, the Emei, Longchi, and other transportation departments concentrated twenty or thirty vehicles in advance, making a concerted effort to rush-transport 1,200 tons of ore in four days, ensuring the normal production of the Leshan Iron and Steel Plant during the rainy season. Thanks to the full development of the spirit of communist collaboration by all units, many problems that were previously considered difficult to solve were easily resolved. For example, the Qianghua Iron and Steel Plant previously needed to transport a portion of its coke from Nangguangmiao, more than a hundred li away. The Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Plant was close to Nangguangmiao, but the coke it needed had to be transported from Yangjiapu, thirty li away, which was very close to Qianghua. During the collaborative competition, they discovered this problem and the Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Plant took the initiative to exchange the coke from Yangjiapu with Qianghua's coke in Nangguangmiao, which not only reduced the need for twenty vehicles per month but also saved 27,000 ton-kilometers of transportation capacity and reduced transportation costs.

Taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward, all relevant units are working hard to improve their own work and complete their tasks, creating favorable conditions for steel production. In order to ensure the coke required for iron smelting by the Qianghua Iron and Steel Plant, the Longchi Coal Mine launched a mass movement of "Ensuring Qianghua with Coke" among its workers. By carefully calculating accounts and organizing workers to visit the Qianghua Iron and Steel Plant, the workers further realized the inseparable link between the coal and coke industry and the steel industry. After the blast furnaces were paired, the daily coke output quickly increased to 320 tons. In the face of increasing transportation volume, the transportation sector, in order to protect steel, implemented a "five-fixed" transportation method of fixing vehicles, fixing personnel, fixing time, fixing routes, and fixing tasks, as well as paired transportation and supply, which not only ensured steel production but also completed the production tasks of their own department.

### 以钢为纲开展协作竞赛  乐山专区工业交通商业部门全面跃进

    以钢为纲开展协作竞赛
    乐山专区工业交通商业部门全面跃进
    本报成都22日电　一个声势更加浩大、范围更加广阔的以钢为纲的综合协作竞赛，在四川乐山专区波澜壮阔地开展起来。目前全区协作竞赛的单位，已在原有钢铁、煤焦、采矿、运输等十九个单位参加的基础上，扩大到机械、电力、化工、商业、邮电、粮食等三十三个单位的数十万职工中。
    今年3月，中共乐山地委为实现以钢为纲，全面跃进，曾以钢铁生产为中心，把有关工业、交通运输企业组织起来，分片对口地开展了综合协作竞赛。经过半年来的实践证明，这是促进各个战线互相协作，共同跃进的有效方法。最近，地委和各厂矿、企业单位，根据全面大跃进发展形势的要求，扩大了参加综合竞赛的行业，进一步加强了对竞赛运动的组织领导。在协作区成立了联合办公室；建立了检查评比和互通情报的制度。
    以钢为纲的综合协作竞赛的开展，消除了企业之间互不通气的状况，树立了以钢为纲、全国一盘棋的观点，出现了一片互相支援共同保证完成生产任务的新气象。8月中旬，据气象预报有连日暴雨，为了保证不致掉料，峨眉、龙池等运输部门提前集中了二、三十辆汽车，连日突击，四天中抢运了矿石一千二百吨，保证了乐山钢铁厂在雨季照常生产。由于各单位充分发挥了共产主义协作精神，使许多过去认为不好解决的问题迎刃而解。例如强华钢铁厂，以往有一部分焦炭需要到百余里外的南广庙去运，乐山磷肥厂与南广庙接近，但他们需用的焦炭却又要到三十里外离强华很近的杨家铺去运。协作竞赛中，彼此发现了这个问题后，乐山磷肥厂便主动将杨家铺的焦炭和强华在南广庙的焦炭互相对换，这不仅每月减少了二十辆汽车运输，还节约了运力二万七千吨公里，又降低了运输成本。
    以钢为纲、全面跃进，各有关单位都努力改进自身工作、完成任务，给钢铁生产创造有利条件。龙池煤矿为保证强华铁厂炼铁用焦需要，在职工中开展了“以焦保强华”的群众运动，通过算细账，组织工人到强华钢铁厂参观访问，使工人进一步认识到煤焦工业与钢铁工业之间血肉不可分割的联系。高炉对口后，接着焦炭日产量迅速提高到三百二十吨。交通运输部门在运量日益增加情况下，为了保钢，实行了定车、定人、定时、定路线、定任务的五定运输法和对口运输供应，既保证了钢铁生产，又完成了本部门的生产任务。（附图片）
