Jingmen County in Hubei Province conscientiously implemented the policy of "actively running well and voluntarily participating," and the six thousand plus rural public mess halls are becoming better and better and more and more consolidated.

In the process of establishing public mess halls, the county Party committee and the production team's Party branch listed running public mess halls well as a regular item on the agenda for research and arrangements. Of the 626 first secretaries of the commune Party committees, management district general branches, and production team branch secretaries in the county, 524 personally ran experimental mess halls. Since the spring of last year, the county has carried out three rectifications of public mess halls, conscientiously improving their operation and management.

While actively strengthening leadership, the county also conscientiously implemented the principle of "voluntary participation in the mess hall, and democratic management of the mess hall." All public mess halls in the county democratically elected mess hall management committees, adhered to the practice of publishing accounts on a regular basis, and various communes successively convened public mess hall representative meetings to listen to the opinions of the masses and improve management.

All mess halls paid attention to the development of non-staple food production, creating material conditions for improving the lives of commune members. As of the end of July, the public mess halls in the county had about 100,000 pigs; the vegetables grown by the public mess halls and privately by individuals averaged 0.3 to 0.5 mu per household.

    荆门县六千食堂个个巩固
    湖北省荆门县认真贯彻“积极办好、自愿参加”的方针，六千多个农村公共食堂越办越好，越来越巩固。
    这个县在办公共食堂的过程中，从县委到生产队的党支部，都把办好公共食堂列为经常的议事日程，加以研究安排。全县公社党委、管理区总支第一书记和生产队的支部书记共六百二十六人，亲自办试验食堂的就有五百二十四人。全县从去年春季以来，对公共食堂进行了三次整顿工作，认真地改进了经营管理。
    在积极加强领导的同时，这个县还认真地贯彻了“自愿入食堂，民主办食堂”的原则。全县公共食堂都民主选举产生了食堂管理委员会，坚持按期公布账目，并且各个公社都先后召开了公共食堂代表会议，听取群众的意见，改进管理工作。
    各食堂都注意了发展副食品生产，为改善社员生活创造了物质条件。截至7月底止，全县公共食堂饲养的猪就有十万头左右；公共食堂和私人种的蔬菜，平均每户已达三分至五分地。
