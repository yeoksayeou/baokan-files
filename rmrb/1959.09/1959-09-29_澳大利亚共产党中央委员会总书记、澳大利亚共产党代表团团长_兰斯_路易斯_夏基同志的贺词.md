Comrades:
	We, the Australian delegation, are very pleased to be here on this inspiring historical occasion to celebrate with you the tenth anniversary of the great victory of the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of your glorious Communist Party.
	The event we are celebrating is indeed one of the most significant events in the entire history of mankind, in the long and tortuous history of mankind's march towards the final, glorious goal of communism.
	Like the great Russian October Revolution, the Chinese Revolution has changed the course of world history.
	It has dealt a fatal blow to imperialism, which plagues mankind, liberated a quarter of humanity from the shackles of colonialism, and inspired hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa and Latin America to fight for an end to foreign oppression.
	Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people have achieved significant and unprecedented achievements in the work of building a socialist society.
	In fact, it is not easy to immediately recognize and fully understand the enormous gains included in the words "Great Leap Forward", the amazing development of the people's communes, and the many other achievements in the socialist construction of your country.
	You have repeatedly emphasized that a major factor is the selfless assistance given to China by the glorious Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp.
	We Australians have encountered a somewhat different kind of "assistance."
	For example, General Motors of the United States has built a large factory in our country. It recently announced its profits for the previous twelve months, totaling an unprecedented record in Australia - 15 million pounds. Workers' wages are exploited by more than a dozen kinds of levies and taxes, while the capital can remit profits to the United States tax-free. It is said that the Australian bourgeoisie is "participating in a partnership", but they only receive a pitiful amount of 39,000 pounds from the 15 million pounds in profit.
	This shows the fundamental difference between the relations of socialist countries based on proletarian internationalism and the dog-eat-dog relations of "struggle against each other" in the capitalist world.
	The "Great Leap Forward," together with the Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year plan and brilliant scientific achievements, as well as the progress of the entire socialist world, is already very clearly changing the views of the Australian people, who have an increasingly favorable impression of the socialist world and of our party.
	When the Soviet Union surpasses the United States in basic production and China is ahead of Britain in basic production, the world climate will indeed undergo major changes.
	Your victory has given new strength and inspiration to the Australian labor movement in its struggle for socialism.
	The common task today is first and foremost to strive to safeguard world peace and defend the peaceful labor of all peoples.
	In order to cover up their own sinful activities and malicious intentions, the imperialists have adopted a trick of accusing the Chinese people of carrying out aggressive policies and even wanting to "conquer Australia."
	We pledge to expose these slanderous rumors even more vigorously, to fight for the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between our two countries, to strive to restore China's rightful place in the United Nations, and to strive to strengthen cultural and economic exchanges between our two peoples.
	We confidently expect the Chinese people to achieve even greater success in their magnificent socialist construction.
	On this memorable occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, we are as delighted as you are.
	Long live the People's Republic of China!
	May the friendship between the Chinese and Australian peoples last forever!
	Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party!
	I wish the People's Republic increasing prosperity and strength!
	(Greetings from Comrade Koplenig, Head of the Austrian Communist Party Delegation, Comrade Hilding Hagberg, Head of the Swedish Communist Party Delegation, and Comrade Bagdash, Head of the Syrian Communist Party Delegation, will be published in tomorrow's newspaper) (with picture)

### 澳大利亚共产党中央委员会总书记、澳大利亚共产党代表团团长  兰斯·路易斯·夏基同志的贺词

    澳大利亚共产党中央委员会总书记、澳大利亚共产党代表团团长
    兰斯·路易斯·夏基同志的贺词同志们：
    我们澳大利亚代表团感到很高兴，能够在这个令人欢欣鼓舞的历史性的节日，到这里来同你们在一起庆祝你们光荣的共产党领导的伟大的中国革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立十周年。
    我们正在庆祝的这个事件，的确是整个人类历史中、人类向共产主义这个最后的、辉煌的目标迈进的漫长而曲折的历史中的最重大的事件之一。
    正像俄国伟大的十月革命一样，中国革命也改变了世界历史的进程。
    它给残害人类的帝国主义以致命的打击，把四分之一的人类从殖民主义的桎梏下解放出来，并且鼓舞亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的亿万人民为结束外国压迫而奋斗。
    伟大的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在建设社会主义社会的工作中获得了重大的、空前的成就。
    事实上，人们觉得不大容易一下子认识和充分了解“大跃进”这几个字所包括的巨大收获、人民公社的惊人发展以及你们国家的社会主义建设方面的其他许多成就。
    你们曾经一再强调，一个主要因素是光荣的苏联和整个社会主义阵营给予中国的无私援助。
    我们澳大利亚人遇到了一种跟这有些不同的“援助”。
    例如，美国通用汽车公司在我国建立了一个大工厂。它最近公布了以前十二个月的利润，总数达到了澳大利亚的空前纪录——一千五百万镑。工人的工资受到十多种苛捐杂税的盘剥，而这个资本却可以把利润免税输往美国。据说澳大利亚资产阶级是“参加合伙”的，但是他们从一千五百万镑的利润中只分到三万九千镑这样可怜的一点点钱。
    这说明了社会主义国家的以无产阶级国际主义为基础的关系和资本主义世界的“你争我夺”的弱肉强食的关系有天壤之别。
    “大跃进”连同苏联的宏伟的七年计划和辉煌的科学成就以及整个社会主义世界的进展，已经在十分明显地改变着澳大利亚人民的观点，他们对社会主义世界、对我们党有了愈来愈良好的印象。
    当苏联在基本生产方面超过美国，中国在基本生产方面走在英国前面的时候，世界的气候确实会发生重大的变化。
    你们的胜利使澳大利亚工人运动在争取社会主义的斗争中得到了新的力量和鼓舞。
    今天的共同任务首先是为维护世界和平、保卫各国人民的和平劳动而奋斗。
    帝国主义者为了掩盖他们自己的罪恶活动和罪恶意图，采取了一种手法，就是指责中国人民执行侵略政策，甚至想“征服澳大利亚”。
    我们保证更大力地揭露这些诽谤性的谰言，为我们两国之间建立正常的外交关系而斗争，努力争取恢复中国在联合国内的应有的地位，争取加强我们两国人民之间的文化和经济来往。
    我们满怀信心地期望中国人民在宏伟的社会主义建设中取得更大的成就。
    在人民共和国建国十周年这个值得纪念的节日，我们同你们一样感到欢欣鼓舞。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民和澳大利亚人民的友谊永世长存！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    祝人民共和国日益繁荣强盛！
