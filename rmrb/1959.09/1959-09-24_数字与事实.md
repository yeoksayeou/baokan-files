Numbers and Facts

The First National Games track and field competition saw 43 athletes break 21 national records. In contrast, the so-called "Seventh National Games" held before liberation in 1948 saw only six athletes break seven national records.

The track and field competition at this National Games was conducted at a level significantly higher than the highest national records before liberation. In many events, even the scores of athletes who did not win a medal were higher than the national records before liberation. For example, 28 female athletes cleared the pre-liberation national record in the high jump (1.40 meters); 43 female athletes threw the discus further than the pre-liberation national record (30.05 meters); and 24 male athletes ran the 5000 meters faster than the pre-liberation national record (16 minutes and 0 seconds).

This National Games demonstrated a general improvement in the level of track and field athletes across the country. The champions of the 42 men's and women's events represented 17 different units: Beijing won eight events, the People's Liberation Army and Shandong each won six, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Sichuan each won three, Hebei and Inner Mongolia each won two, and Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Shanghai, Henan, and Jiangsu each won one.

In many track and field events at this National Games, a large number of athletes with very similar levels emerged during the competition (including qualifying rounds, preliminary rounds, semi-finals, repechage, and finals). For example:

	Men's 100 meters: seven athletes had times under 11 seconds;
	Men's 1500 meters: six athletes had times under 4 minutes;
	Men's 5000 meters: three athletes had times under 15 minutes;
	Men's Pole Vault: eight athletes reached 4.10 meters;
	Men's Long Jump: eight athletes exceeded 7 meters;
	Men's Triple Jump: four athletes exceeded 15 meters;
	Men's High Jump: seven athletes reached 1.90 meters;
	Women's 400 meters: four athletes had times under 1 minute;
	Women's High Jump: three athletes cleared 1.65 meters;
	Women's Discus Throw: seven athletes exceeded 40 meters.
