The acrobatic art performance dedicated to the National Day made me excited. From those ten-plus programs with national characteristics, people can see that China's acrobatic art, which has a long historical tradition, has been greatly enriched and improved in recent years, blooming with lush and bright flowers. For example, Fu Xuehui, Zhao Shurong, Suo Agui, and Xia Yingxia, four young actors in their teens, performed "Children's Games." Their lively, innocent, beautiful, and skillful performance made the audience feel extremely happy and excited. Their aerial performance inherited the skills of the traditional "axis pole" and absorbed the techniques from the leather strap, trapeze, and other programs in acrobatics. Beautiful dances connected each skill, forming extremely beautiful pictures in the air. The change of each movement is like aerial soft gymnastics. Stability, accuracy, and beauty are the biggest characteristics of this program. From the performance of these young people, we can see the youth of the ancient acrobatic art.

Jin Liandi from the Chongqing Acrobatic Troupe performed "Foot Juggling with Umbrellas," which also showed us the fresh atmosphere of acrobatic art. This program belongs to the ancient Chinese acrobatic art of "foot juggling." The actress inherited the skills of juggling jars and square tables with her feet. Based on traditional skills, she used the principles of natural science to create and develop it. She skillfully opened the umbrella with her feet and used skillful techniques to make the umbrella rotate back and forth, left and right, as if flying on her feet. In order to change the patterns, she could immediately stop the umbrella that was spinning on her feet. Whether it was rotating or stopping, it seemed as if the umbrella was tightly glued to her feet. The most wonderful thing was that at the end of the program, she also used her feet to close the umbrella. The graceful movements and skillful techniques made the audience feel surprised, relaxed, and happy.

Cheng Lianbao, Cheng Liansheng, Cheng Lianyu, Cheng Liangui, and Cheng Wenqun brothers of the China Acrobatic Troupe, who have been praised by audiences at home and abroad, connect many essential skills in acrobatics with martial arts techniques and beautiful dance to form a complete program. They absorb the wonderful parts of handstands, foot juggling, rolling through hoops, whirls, somersaults, and leaps into the martial arts program and arrange them, so that the entire program is in a tense, relaxed, and beautiful atmosphere. Their performance shows us that a good acrobat should not only master one acrobatic skill, but also master a variety of acrobatic skills, in order to make an acrobatic program rich and colorful. At the same time, the various skills must be practiced to the degree of being refined, skilled, stable, and accurate, so that the actors can use them freely and absorb beautiful dances to enrich the skills, so that the audience can feel relaxed, happy, and beautiful. The Cheng Lianbao brothers' "Little Martial Arts" embodies these characteristics.

The reason why He Tianchong and Liu Xiaoling's "Balancing Act" is so popular with the audience also lies in this. They also absorbed the wonderful skills of foot juggling, handstands, and contortion to form a complete "Balancing Act" program. They also arranged the program with ups and downs and climaxes. The first half of the program used top skills, bending over, splitting legs, and other skills to form a wonderful contortion, paving the way for the entire program. Then they used foot juggling skills to bring the program to a climax. When an actor kicks up another actor, their skillful technique makes it as easy as Jin Liandi kicking an umbrella on her foot. The speed at which the actor spins on the foot is no less than the speed of the umbrella. When the actor leaves the foot, he is as light and graceful as dancing ballet. The whole program has not left the techniques and dance, so the program has always been maintained in a beautiful and relaxed atmosphere.

Jin Yeqin, Jin Shuqin, Zhang Hua and others' "Cycling Acrobatics" is also a program praised by audiences at home and abroad. In this performance, their three-tier structure on the bicycle was more stable and beautiful than before. More people performed on the bicycle, making it even richer. The changes in each movement are also connected by dance, making it more beautiful. Each time people are added, it is like a beautiful picture is changing. The entire performance is changing from beginning to end. Each change ends with wonderful skills. From the programs they perform, we can also see that an artistic work can only maintain its artistic youth forever if it is constantly enriched, improved, and developed.

"Ventriliquism" is also an old program, but the audience still feels fresh. This is because the actors have new creations. They not only learn the sounds vividly, but also experience the life of the object they want to learn, and create external movements suitable for the sound, so that not only the sound is vivid, but also the external movements powerfully increase the effect of ventriloquism. Therefore, the audience said it is vivid and fascinating.

The "Diabolo" and "Jar Juggling" programs that Beijing audiences are familiar with have new creations and new developments. They have all developed from solo performances to duo performances or three- or four-person performances. They used wonderful performances to make up for the past gaps, making the program more compact and beautiful. Not only each program eliminated the phenomenon of intermittence, but also the entire evening program. The humorous performances in between the acts were also very humorous and wonderful programs. The "grabbing chairs" and "flipping dishes" programs they performed were not only very funny in action, but the entire program was arranged with acrobatic skills as the main stem, so the performance style of these programs was consistent with the style of the entire program.

The entire evening program is accompanied by music suitable for the atmosphere of the performance program. Musical accompaniment increased the sense of rhythm of the acrobatic performance program and further strengthened the effect of acrobatic performance art. Our beloved acrobatic art has a brand new look.

    杂技艺术面貌全新
    张梦庚
    我兴奋地看到了向国庆献礼的杂技艺术表演。从那十多个具有民族风格的节目，人们可以看到具有悠久历史传统的我国杂技艺术，近年来又得到很大的丰富和提高，开放出茂盛鲜艳的花朵。如傅学惠、赵淑蓉、索阿贵、夏英侠，四个十几岁的青年演员，表演的“儿童游戏”，他们活泼、天真、优美而又纯熟的表演使观众感到极大的愉快与兴奋，他们的空中表演是继承了传统“轴棍”的技巧，并且吸取了杂技中皮条、吊子等节目中的技术，用优美的舞蹈衔接着每个技巧，在空中构成一幅一幅极美的画面，每个动作的变化又好像是空中柔软体操，稳、准、美是这个节目最大的特点，从这几个青年的表演中，使我们看到了古老的杂技艺术的青春。
    重庆杂技团金连娣表演的“蹬伞”，同样使我们看到了杂技艺术的新鲜气象。这个节目是属于中国古老的杂技艺术中的“蹬技”，演员继承了蹬坛子、蹬方桌中的技巧，在传统技巧的基础上，利用自然科学的原理加以创作发展，他巧妙的用脚把伞打开，用熟练的技巧使伞在脚上前后左右飞似的旋转，为着变化花样他能使在正转中的伞即刻停在脚上，无论是旋转无论是停下都好像是伞紧紧粘在他的脚上，最妙是在节目结束时他还用脚把伞合起来，优美的动作，纯熟的技巧，使观众感到惊奇，又感到轻松、愉快。
    曾受到国内外观众称赞的中国杂技团成连宝，成连生、成连玉、成连贵、成文群弟兄，把很多杂技中的精华技巧，用武术的技巧与优美的舞蹈贯穿起来，构成一个完整的节目。他们把手顶、蹬技、钻地圈、旋子、跟头、蹿毛等等技巧的精彩部分，吸取到武术节目中来，加以编排，使整个节目都在紧张、轻松、优美的气氛中，他们的表演使我们看到了，一个好的杂技演员不但要掌握一项杂技技巧，而且要掌握多种的杂技技巧，才能使一个杂技节目丰富多彩，同时要把各种技巧练到精、熟、稳、准的程度，演员才能运用自如，才能吸取优美的舞蹈来丰富技巧，才能使观众感到轻松，愉快，优美，成连宝兄弟的“小武术”，就体现了这些特点。
    何天宠、刘小玲表演的“平衡造型”，受到观众热烈欢迎的道理也在于此，他们也是吸取了蹬技，对手顶，柔术等精彩的技巧构成了一个完整的“平衡造型”节目，他们也把节目编排得有起有伏有高潮，前半部用顶功，弯腰，劈叉等技巧构成精彩的柔术铺平了整个节目，然后他们又用蹬技技巧使节目进入高潮，一个演员把一个演员蹬起，他们的纯熟技巧把人蹬起来时，好像金连娣把伞蹬在脚上一样的轻便，演员在脚上飞转速度也不亚于伞的速度，在演员离开脚时，好像跳芭蕾舞一样的轻巧优美。整个节目都没有离开技巧与舞蹈，因此使节目一直是保持在优美、轻松的气氛中。
    金业勤、金淑勤、张华等表演的“车技”，也是被国内外观众称赞的节目。在这次演出里，他们表演车上三节比过去更稳、更美了，很多人在车子上表演更丰富了，每个动作的变化，也都是用舞蹈把它衔接起来，显得更优美了，每次增加人时，都是像一个美的画面在变化，整个表演从头到尾都在变化中，每次变化都是用精彩的技巧结束。从他们表演的节目中，也可以使我们看到，一个艺术作品，只有不断地丰富，不断地提高和发展，才会永远保持着艺术的青春。
      “口技”也是个老节目，但是观众仍然感到新鲜。这是因为演员们又有了新的创作。他们不但学的声音逼真，还体会了要学的对象的生活，创作了适合声音的外形动作，因此不但声音逼真，而外形动作也有力地增加了口技的效果，所以观众说它有声有色，引人入胜。
    北京观众熟悉的“空竹”、“坛子”等节目都有了新的创作，新的发展，他们都从单人表演发展到了双人表演或三、四人表演了，他们用精彩的表演弥补了过去的间歇，使节目更加紧凑和优美。不但是每个节目消灭了间歇现象，整个晚会节目也是如此。幕间滑稽的表演也都是很幽默很精彩的节目。他们表演的“抢椅子”、“翻盘”等等节目，不但动作很有风趣，而且整个节目是用杂技技巧为主干编排成的，因此这些节目的表演风格与整个节目的风格是一致的。
    整个晚会节目以适合表演节目气氛的音乐来伴奏，音乐伴奏增加了杂技表演节目的节奏感，更加强了杂技表演艺术的效果。我们喜爱的杂技艺术，它已经面貌全新了。
