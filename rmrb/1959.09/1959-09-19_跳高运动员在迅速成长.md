High jump is one of the oldest track and field events. From the first Olympic Games (Athens, 1896) to the 16th Olympic Games (Melbourne, 1956), high jump has always occupied an important position in track and field events.

Before liberation, China's high jump movement was very backward. The highest record for women's high jump was 1.40 meters, and the record for men's high jump was only 1.86 meters. In recent years, Chinese high jump athletes and coaches have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and created training methods suitable for China's characteristics. In a short period of time, they have not only far surpassed the records before liberation, but also the achievements of outstanding male and female high jump athletes have approached the international level.

In 1957, Zheng Fengrong broke the world record of 1.76 meters held by American high jumper and Olympic champion Mildred McDaniel, creating a new world record of 1.77 meters for women's high jump. For the first time, the name of a Chinese athlete appeared on the list of world record holders in the history of world track and field. Our male high jump athletes have also made rapid progress. Ma Xianglong raised the record to 2.01 meters in 1958. Recently, Shi Hongfan, an eighteen-year-old athlete from Shandong, created a new national record of 2.02 meters in Beijing.

During the Great Leap Forward, young and talented high jump athletes continued to emerge. In addition to Zheng Fengrong, six female athletes have achieved scores of 1.60 to 1.62 meters this year, including Wu Fushan, who is only sixteen years old. In addition, many athletes have scores exceeding 1.50 meters. Currently, the performance level of the top ten in women's high jump in China ranks second in the world, second only to the Soviet Union. And most of these ten outstanding athletes are under twenty years old. The oldest is Zheng Fengrong, who is only twenty-two years old. In men's high jump, the performance of young athletes is also improving rapidly. Two years ago, there were only three athletes who jumped over the master athlete standard of 1.92 meters, but now there are thirteen. In addition to Shi Hongfan, An Zhanxue has also made particularly rapid progress, reaching a score of 1.96 meters. In addition, there are many talented high jump athletes in China who are not yet twenty years old.

The achievements made in China's high jump movement are inseparable from the young athletes putting politics in command and working hard under the guidance of correct coaching methods. Through unremitting efforts, some outstanding high jump athletes have quickly mastered modern high jump techniques and created jumping styles suitable for their own physiques. For example, the "scissors" jumping style adopted by most of China's outstanding female high jump athletes is very different from that of foreign countries. European experts and coaches even call Zheng Fengrong's jumping style "Oriental style." Facts have proved that our "Oriental scissors" has many advantages and is completely suitable for women. Foreign experts and coaches once said that it takes two to three years of tenacious practice to master the "straddle" high jump technique. However, many of our young high jump athletes broke superstitions and mastered the most complex "straddle" technique in a very short period of time, and achieved excellent results. For example, young high jump athletes Shi Hongfan, Kang Jubei, and Duan Qiyan mastered the "straddle" style in about a year and greatly improved their scores, becoming master athletes.

Due to the large number of newcomers and the continuous improvement of results, high jump will be one of the most intense competition events at the First National Games. In women's high jump, Zheng Fengrong will meet strong competitors such as Yang Meiru, Zhang Jingying, Guo Naiying, Dong Yisheng, and Wu Fushan for the first time. The competition in men's high jump will be even more intense. China's young high jump athletes Shi Hongfan, An Zhanxue, Duan Qiyan, Tao Chenghong, Chen Zhongyuan, and Li Jingming have similar scores. Through competition, we can fully expect to see even newer results exceeding 2.02 meters.

    跳高运动员在迅速成长
    黄健
    跳高是最老的田径比赛项目之一。从第一届奥林匹克运动会（雅典，1896年）到第十六届奥林匹克运动会（墨尔本，1956年），跳高在田径比赛项目中始终占着重要的地位。
    解放前，我国的跳高运动非常落后，女子跳高的最高纪录是一米四十，而男子跳高的纪录也只有一米八十六。近几年来，我国的跳高运动员和教练员学习了苏联的先进经验，并创造了适合我国特点的锻炼方法，在短时期内不仅远远地超过了解放前的纪录，而且优秀的男女跳高运动员的成绩已接近了国际水平。
    1957年郑凤荣打破美国跳高运动员、奥林匹克冠军麦克丹妮保持的一米七十六的世界纪录，创造了女子跳高一米七十七的世界新纪录，在世界田径史的世界纪录保持者的名单中第一次出现中国运动员的名字。我们的男子跳高运动员同样进步很快，马翔龙在1958年把纪录提高到二米零一。最近，十八岁的山东运动员史洪范在北京又创造了二米零二的全国新成绩。
    在大跃进中，年轻的有天才的跳高运动员不断出现。除了郑凤荣以外，今年已经有六名女运动员达到了一米六十到一米六十二的成绩，其中的吴福山只有十六岁。此外，还有很多运动员的成绩超过了一米五十。现在我国女子跳高方面前十名的成绩水平已占世界第二位，仅次于苏联。而这十名优秀运动员，大多数还不满二十岁，最大的是郑凤荣，也只有二十二岁。男子跳高方面，年轻的运动员的成绩同样在迅速提高。两年前只有三名运动员跳过一米九十二的运动健将级标准，现在则已经有十三个人了。进步特别快的，除史洪范以外还有安占学，他达到一米九十六的成绩。此外，我国还有不少天才跳高运动员的年龄还不到二十岁。
    我国的跳高运动所取得的成就，是同青年运动员们政治挂帅，在正确的教练方法指导下，刻苦锻炼分不开的。一些优秀的跳高运动员经过顽强努力，很快地掌握了现代的跳高技术，并创造了适合自己体格的跳法。例如，我国大多数的优秀女跳高运动员采用的“剪式”跳法就同外国的有很大区别，欧洲的专家和教练员甚至把郑凤荣跳的方式称作“东方式”。事实证明，我们的“东方剪式”是具有很多优点，并完全适合于女子。外国专家和教练员曾说，要掌握“俯卧式”的跳高技术，需要两三年的顽强练习。但是我们很多青年跳高运动员打破了迷信，在很短时期内就掌握了最复杂的“俯卧式”的技术，并得到了优秀的成绩。例如，青年跳高运动员史洪范、康驹培、段其炎等大约在一年之内就掌握了“俯卧式”，并大大地提高了自己的成绩，成了运动健将。
    由于新手的大量涌现和成绩的不断提高，在第一届全国运动会上，跳高将是田径赛中最紧张的比赛项目之一。女子跳高方面，郑凤荣将第一次和强的竞争者杨美如、张晶莹、郭乃莹、董沂生、吴福山等见面。男子跳高的竞争将更激烈，我国年轻的跳高运动员史洪范、安占学、段其炎、陶成洪、陈钟元、李景明等，成绩在伯仲之间，通过竞争，完全可以期待着产生超过二米零二的更新成绩。
