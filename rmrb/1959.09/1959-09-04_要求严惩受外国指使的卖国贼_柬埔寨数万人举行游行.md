Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, September 2nd: Cambodian newspapers today, commenting on the bomb explosion at the Cambodian Royal Palace on August 31st, pointed out that the mastermind behind the conspiracy to assassinate the King was Son Sann. These newspapers demanded the death penalty for Cambodian traitors and called for constant vigilance against the conspiracies of traitors supported by foreigners.

Phnom Penh Radio also provided new information today regarding the attempted assassination of the King. The radio station said that along with the "gift" sent to the Queen was a handwritten but unsigned card, written in the name of Michael Baker (an American who participated in the construction of the road from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville).

A full-time police officer assigned to Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk received a threatening letter dated August 9th, sent from Phnom Penh, telling him to leave Sihanouk's office, because "we will annihilate him along with his family."

Tens of thousands of Cambodian parliamentarians, civil servants, soldiers, members of the Cambodian Royal Socialist Youth League, and others marched in front of the Royal Palace today, vehemently condemning the crimes of Cambodian traitors against the King.

The Cambodian Parliament, the Central Government, the Royal Armed Forces, the Cambodian Royal Socialist Youth League, and various provinces have all put forward motions unanimously demanding that these traitors be sentenced to death.

In thanking the people, the King of Cambodia said that in the current difficult situation, Cambodia will always adopt a peaceful and neutral policy and maintain national unity.

    要求严惩受外国指使的卖国贼
    柬埔寨数万人举行游行
    据新华社金边2日电　柬埔寨许多报纸今天在评论柬埔寨宫廷8月31日发生的炸弹爆炸案时指出，企图谋杀国王的阴谋的主使人是桑·萨里。这些报纸要求判处柬埔寨卖国贼死刑，并且永远警惕受到外国人支持的卖国贼的阴谋。
    金边电台今天对企图谋杀国王的事件也提供了新的情况。这家电台说，与送给王后的“礼物”一起的有一张手写的但没有签名的卡片，这张卡片是以迈克尔·贝克（曾参加建设金边通往西哈努克城的公路的一个美国人）的名义写的。
    柬埔寨首相西哈努克身边的一名专职警官曾经收到一封日期为8月9日、寄自金边的恐吓信，要他离开西哈努克的办公地方，因为“我们要连同他的一家一并消灭掉”。
    柬埔寨议员、公务人员、军人、柬埔寨皇家社会主义青年联盟盟员等数万人今天在皇宫前面游行，猛烈地谴责柬埔寨的卖国贼反对国王的罪行。
    柬埔寨议会、中央政府、皇家军队、柬埔寨皇家社会主义青年联盟和各省都提出了动议，一致要求把这些叛国者处以死刑。
    柬埔寨国王在答谢人民时说，在目前困难的形势下，柬埔寨将始终采取和平中立政策，并且保持国家的统一。
