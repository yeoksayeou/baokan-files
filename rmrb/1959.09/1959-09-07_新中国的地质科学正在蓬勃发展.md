The geological science of New China, along with the leap-forward development of the nation's economic and cultural construction, has advanced by leaps and bounds in the past decade under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, just like other sciences. The geological workforce has grown stronger, the level of geological exploration and geological research has improved, geological work has been widely carried out throughout the country, and a large number of mineral resources have been uncovered.

Before liberation, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the geological science cause in our country was a bleak and desolate scene, but today it is a vigorous and brand-new situation. At the beginning of liberation, the geological workforce only had about two hundred people, but today the number of geological graduates from colleges and universities is dozens of times more than in the past, and the current number of students majoring in geology in colleges and universities is in the tens of thousands.

Before liberation, although we also had a few geological work organizations, the number of people was very small. In addition, the reactionary government did not pay any attention to geological science, and geological workers had to carry out some geological surveys and research in difficult circumstances. But today, specialized geological exploration institutions have been established in all provinces and regions of the country, undertaking a large number of general survey and exploration tasks. Geological research institutions have been greatly developed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant ministries of the Central Government; during the great leap forward in 1958, geological research institutions in most provinces and regions were also established, and a strong geological science army is taking shape.

	Brilliant Achievements in Finding Mineral Resources

Currently, regional geological surveys at a scale of 1:200,000 are being conducted or will be conducted in many provinces and regions of our country, and some areas have also conducted geological surveys at a scale of 1:100,000 or 1:50,000. Work has also been carried out to varying degrees in many areas that were previously blank areas in geology. A new 1:3,000,000 national geological map has been compiled and will be published soon; the existing 1:1,000,000 geological map has also been revised and supplemented. Most provinces and regions across the country are compiling geological maps of each province and region at a scale of 1:1,000,000. The content of the new geological maps is greatly enriched compared with the original geological maps. The completion of these basic maps reflects the results of a large amount of labor by geological workers in our country, and at the same time has important significance both theoretically and practically.

In terms of resource exploration, the introduction of new technologies and new methods, such as geophysical, geochemical and isotope methods, plays a certain role in the search for and expansion of resources. The pessimistic views on my country's mineral resources in old China have long been shattered in the face of iron facts.

The proven iron ore reserves in my country since liberation are no longer calculated in hundreds of millions, but in tens of billions. Coal reserves are calculated in hundreds of billions. It is worth emphasizing that economically valuable deposits have also been found in provinces that were originally short of iron and coal, such as Jiangxi, Henan, and Guangxi.

My country's tungsten, tin, antimony and other mineral deposits have long been world-renowned. But no one knows how much the reserves are. After systematic exploration and research in recent years, the proven reserves alone are among the top in the world. Molybdenum deposits have been discovered in large quantities since liberation, and the proven reserves now exceed those of the United States, which accounts for 90% of the reserves in capitalist countries.

In recent years, large copper and lead-zinc deposits have been continuously discovered, turning my country from a country lacking non-ferrous metal mineral resources into a country rich in non-ferrous metals. In recent years, promising chromium ore areas have been found in North China, and economically valuable nickel deposits have been found in South China and North China, which has changed the situation that my country had no chromium or nickel in the past.

Regarding rare and dispersed element deposits, attention has also begun to be paid to them in my country in recent years, and some large deposits have been discovered.

With the discovery of a large number of mineral deposits, not only has my country's mineral base been expanded, but also our theoretical understanding of metallogeny has been enriched. We have studied many new types of large mineral deposits, such as pyrite-type copper deposits, disseminated veinlet-type copper deposits, lead deposits, scheelite skarn-type tungsten deposits, and magmatic, chromium, nickel and rare element deposits from different perspectives. Some new results have also been obtained in terms of the genesis and distribution patterns of minerals. Metallogenic maps and prediction maps of national and regional scales in different proportions are being drawn or are being prepared for drawing. This will be helpful for future prospecting work.

The discovery of petroleum reserves in my country is also increasing rapidly. Old oil fields have been expanded several times, and large-scale new oil fields have been discovered in the northwest and southwest, and many new oil fields have already produced oil.

The development of petroleum geological work in my country, new exploration technologies and comprehensive research play an important role. Many structural geologists, geophysicists, and sedimentologists have participated in this work. Relatively complete laboratories have also been established, carrying out a large number of mechanical analyses, lithological and petrographic tests, chemical analyses and other aspects of work. A large amount of practical data shows many characteristics of my country's oil fields, such as continental oil storage, platform area oil storage, oil formation time, and the relationship between late tectonic movements and oil storage. At the same time, it clarifies some incomplete views on my country's petroleum resources in the past, thus effectively expanding my country's petroleum base. In recent years, oil traces have been discovered in the plains of eastern and northeastern China, which further expands my country's petroleum prospects.

In the past decade, under the leadership of the Party, our geological workers have continuously sent good news from barren mountains, deserts, forests, plateaus, and every corner of the motherland. Especially during the great leap forward in 1958, an unprecedented mass prospecting movement was launched throughout the country. In just over half a year, 160,000 new mineral points were discovered, some of which have been proven to have great economic value.

Our geological workers have also participated in the great socialist construction of the motherland and mass water conservancy projects, such as the river basin planning of large rivers, the construction of canal networks and railway networks connecting the whole country, the development and distribution of groundwater in arid areas and karst areas, and soil and water conservation in the Yellow River basin. Distribution maps of Quaternary sediments, neotectonic maps, and loess distribution maps of the Yellow River basin have been compiled at different scales throughout the country. In other large-scale projects, such as the Huai River Reservoir, the Yangtze River Bridge, and the Sanmenxia large-scale hydraulic hub, our geological workers have played an active role.

	The Rapid Change in the Face of Geological Science

The incomplete and backward appearance of geological science in our country before liberation is rapidly changing. Our research work is based on the broad masses of the people and is closely integrated with the tasks of national economic construction. Under the leadership of the Party, the plan for the scientific development vision was formulated in 1956, which further encouraged the confidence of geological scientists.

With the development and needs of New China's construction, some new geological disciplines, such as geochemistry, geophysics, marine geology, hydrogeology, engineering geology, neotectonics, Quaternary geology, sedimentology, and palynology, have been established and are being developed. The new instruments in the laboratory have been expanded to varying degrees in various research work, so the quality of analysis has been greatly improved, and the efficiency and accuracy of chemical analysis and physical analysis have been improved.

The accumulation and summary of a large amount of basic data and analytical identification data has enriched the content of geological science.

The research on geomechanics and geotectonics has been further developed after liberation, and specialized geomechanics research institutions have been established. Professor Li Siguang's research on geotectonics using geomechanical principles and mechanical test results provides a new way to solve the problem of crustal tectonic movement. A 1:4,000,000 national geotectonic map will be published soon; a 1:3,000,000 national geotectonic map is also being compiled. This will help us understand the basic geological problems in our country.

Biostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy have achieved many new results in the division and comparison of strata in major regions of the country. The discovery and research of a large number of fossil vertebrate fossils and human fossils has strengthened the knowledge of new strata and the development of human history. The study of ancient metamorphic rock series has begun to use some absolute age identification data to solve some long-standing stratigraphic age problems, and has also proved that a series of mineral deposits related to ancient strata are more widely distributed than previously known.

In recent years, some work has also been done in the study of regional magmatic activity and mineralization. For example, the work on Mesozoic granites in eastern China, Lower Paleozoic volcanic rocks in the Qilian Mountains, the distribution and genesis of ultrabasic rocks, basic rocks and related chromium-nickel deposits has accumulated a large amount of data. The study of alkaline rocks and technical petrology has also yielded some results.

The study of the material composition of minerals, mineral symbiotic combinations, and the technical processing of various ores has greatly enriched the content of mineralogy and geochemistry in my country. Many minerals that were not found in China in the past have been continuously added, and new minerals and new mineral varieties have also been discovered. The systematic study of regional mineralogy and the mineralogy of weathering crusts and oxidation zones have also begun to attract attention. Some work has also been done on the transformation of the physical properties of minerals at high temperature and high pressure and the manufacture of artificial minerals.

The geological publishing work in my country related to geological science has also made significant progress. In the early days of liberation, we translated a large number of geological works from the Soviet Union and other countries. In recent years, the number and quality of domestic specialized works have been continuously increasing and improving. National geological publications have a certain number, and the number of larger comprehensive monographs, research collections, regional geology chronicles, mineral chronicles, and geological textbooks for colleges and universities has increased significantly.

These achievements fully prove the correctness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and also fully prove that the development of socialist science has a strong vitality.

As we welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries for their selfless assistance to our country's scientific cause; the great friendship between the people of China, the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries permeates every achievement of our geological work.

The high-speed development of various production and construction undertakings in our country constantly puts forward more tasks for geological workers. Although our geological workers have done a lot of work in the past decade, it is far from meeting the requirements of the country and the people, and our scientific level is still backward. Every one of our geological workers has the confidence and determination to work hard with soaring energy, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, hold high the red flag of the general line, and push the geological science cause of our country to a peak.

    新中国的地质科学正在蓬勃发展
    中国科学院地质研究所所长　侯德封
    新中国的地质科学随着国家的经济文化建设的飞跃发展，十年来在党的领导下和在苏联以及其他兄弟国家的帮助下，像其他科学一样大踏步地前进。地质工作队伍壮大了，地质勘探和地质研究工作的水平提高了，地质工作在全国范围内广泛地展开，大量的矿产资源被揭露出来。
    解放以前在国民党反动派统治下，我国的地质科学事业是一片萧条冷落的景象，而今天却是蓬蓬勃勃的一个崭新的局面。解放初期的地质工作队伍仅有两百来人，而今天从事地质工作的高等学校毕业生较过去的人数增加了几十倍，目前在高等学校学习的地质专业学生的人数则以万计。
    解放以前，我们虽然也有几个地质工作机构，但人数很少，加上反动政府对地质科学毫不重视，地质工作者不能不在艰难的环境下进行一些地质调查和研究。但是今天全国各个省区都成立了专门的地质勘探机构，担负着大量的普查和勘探任务。地质研究机构在中国科学院和中央有关各部都得到大力的发展；在1958年大跃进的年月里，多数省区的地质研究机构也都成立起来了，一个壮大的地质科学大军正在形成中。
                寻找矿产资源取得辉煌战果
    目前在我国许多省区都在进行或者将要进行二十万分之一的区域的地质测量，有些地区还进行了十万分之一或五万分之一的地质测量。在许多过去是地质上的空白区也进行了不同程度的工作，新的三百万分之一全国地质图已经编制成功，并即将出版；旧有的一百万分之一的地质图也作了修整和补充。全国大多省区都在进行各省、区的一百万分之一的地质图的编制。新的地质图的内容较原有的地质图大大地充实了。这些基本图件的完成，反映了我国地质工作者大量劳动的成果，同时无论在理论上和实际上都有着重要的意义。
    在资源勘探方面，新技术新方法的引用，如地球物理、地球化学和同位素的方法等，对资源的寻找和扩大都起着一定的作用。旧中国对我国矿产资源抱悲观的论调早已经在铁的事实面前粉碎了。
    我国从解放以后所探明的铁矿储量，已经不是以亿来计算，而是以百亿来计算了。煤矿储量更是以千亿来计算。值得着重提出的是，在原来缺铁、缺煤的省份，如江西、河南、广西，也找到了有经济价值的矿床。
    我国的钨、锡、锑等矿床早已经闻名世界。但是储量究竟有多少，谁也不知道。经过近几年来的系统勘探研究，仅探明的储量已经位居世界前列。钼矿是在解放以后才大量发现的，现在探明的储量已经超过占资本主义国家储量90％的美国。
    近几年来，大型的铜矿和铅锌矿不断发现，使我国由过去缺乏有色金属矿产的国家变成了有色金属很丰富的国家。近年来又在华北找到有远景的铬矿地区，在华南和华北都发现具有经济价值的镍矿，这就改变了我国过去完全没有铬镍的状况。
    关于稀有、分散元素矿床，近几年来在我国也开始注意，一些大型矿床已经被发现。
    随着大量矿床的发现，不但扩大了我国的矿产基地，同时也丰富了我们对矿床学的理论认识。对许多新类型的大型矿床，如黄铁矿型铜矿、细脉浸染型铜矿，铅矿，矽嘎岩型白钨矿床和岩浆，铬、镍矿和稀有元素矿床等，我们都从不同的角度进行了研究。在矿产的成因和分布规律方面，也获得了一些新的成果。不同比例尺的全国范围的和区域性的成矿图以及预测图都正在绘制或者准备绘制。这对今后找矿工作是有帮助的。
    我国的石油储量的发现也在迅速地增多。旧的油田扩大了几倍，在西北和西南发现了大规模的新油田，许多新油田已经出油。
    我国石油地质工作的发展，新的勘探技术和综合研究起着重要的作用。许多构造学家、地球物理学家、沉积学家都参加了这项工作。比较完善的试验室也建立起来了，进行着大量的机械分析，岩性、岩相试验，化学分析等各方面的工作。大量的实际资料说明了我国油田的许多特点，如陆相储油、地台区储油、成油时间以及晚期构造运动对储油的关系等，同时澄清了过去对我国石油资源的一些不全面的看法，因而有效地扩大了我国的石油基地。近年来又在我国东部和东北的平原地区发现含油迹象，这就更加扩大了我国石油的远景。
    十年来在党的领导下，我们的地质工作者从荒山、沙漠、森林、高原，以及祖国每一个角落，都不断地传来捷报。特别是在1958年的大跃进中，在全国范围内掀起一个空前的群众性的找矿运动，仅在半年多的时间内，就发现了十六万个新矿点，其中有些已经证明具有很大的经济价值。
    我们地质工作者也参加了祖国伟大的社会主义工程建设和群众性的水利工程，如大河的流域规划，贯通全国的运河网和铁道网的修筑，干旱地区以及喀斯特地区的地下水的发育和分布，黄河流域的水土保持等。全国不同比例尺的第四纪沉积物分布图、新构造图，以及黄河流域的黄土分布图等都已经编制出来。在其它一些大型的工程中，如淮河水库、长江大桥、三门峡等大型的水力枢纽等方面，我们的地质工作者都发挥了积极的作用。
                地质科学面貌迅速改变
    解放以前，我国地质科学那样残缺不全的落后面貌正在迅速地改变。我们的研究工作是建筑在广大群众的基础上，同时又是和国家经济建设任务密切结合的。在党的领导下，1956年制定了科学发展远景的规划，更加鼓舞了地质科学工作者的信心。
    随着新中国建设事业的发展和需要，一些新的地质学科，如地球化学、地球物理、海洋地质、水文地质、工程地质、新构造、第四纪地质、沉积学、孢粉学等都已经建立起来，并展开工作。试验室的新仪器，在各项研究工作中都有了不同程度的扩充，因而分析的质量大大地提高，化学分析和物理分析的效能和精确度都有所提高。
    大量基本资料和分析鉴定数据的积累和总结，丰富了地质科学的内容。
    地质力学和地质构造的研究，在解放后获得了进一步的发展，并且建立了专门的地质力学研究机构。李四光教授引用地质力学原则和力学试验结果对地质构造的研究，为解决地壳构造运动问题提出了新的途径。四百万分之一的全国大地构造图即将出版；三百万分之一的全国大地构造图也在编制。这都有助于我们对我国地质基本问题的认识。
    生物地层学、岩石地层学，在全国各大地区的地层划分和对比方面取得了许多新的成果。大量古脊椎动物化石和人类化石的发现与研究，加强了对新地层和人类历史发展的知识。对古老变质岩系的研究，开始引用了一些绝对年龄鉴定数据，解决了一些悬而未决的地层时代问题，同时也证明了一系列与古老地层有关的矿床，在分布上较从前所知道的更为广泛。
    近年来在区域性岩浆活动和成矿作用的研究方面也作了一些工作。如对我国东部中生代花岗岩类、祁连山区下古生代的火山岩，对超基性岩、基性岩以及与之有关的铬镍矿床的分布和成因等方面的工作，都积累了大量的资料。碱性岩的研究，技术岩石学的研究也有了一些结果。
    矿物的物质成分、矿物共生组合以及各种矿石的技术加工研究，大大丰富了我国矿物学和地球化学的内容。许多过去在中国没有发现的矿物不断地被补充起来，新的矿物和新的矿物变种也有所发现。区域矿物学的系统研究，风化壳和氧化带的矿物学工作，也都开始注意起来。在高温、高压下矿物物理性质的转变以及人工矿物的制造，也进行了一些工作。
    与地质科学有关的我国地质出版工作，也有了显著的发展。解放初期，我们大量地翻译了苏联和其他国家的一些地质著作。最近几年，国内一些专门著作的数量、质量在不断增加和提高。全国性的地质刊物已经有一定的数量，较大的综合性的专著，研究专集，区域地质志，矿物志以及供给大专学校用的地质教科书的出版数量，都有显著增长。
    这些成就，充分证明了中国共产党领导的正确，同时也充分证明了社会主义科学事业的发展是具有强大的生命力的。
    在我们迎接国庆十周年的时候，我们怀着敬爱的心情感谢苏联和其他兄弟国家对我国科学事业无私的援助；在我们每一项地质工作的成就中，都渗透着中苏和其他兄弟国家人民之间的伟大友谊。
    我们国家各项生产建设事业高速度的发展，对地质工作者不断地提出更多的任务。十年来我们地质工作者虽然作了不少工作，但是还远远不能满足国家和人民的要求，我们的科学水平还落后。我们每一个地质工作者都有信心和决心，用冲天的干劲，刻苦努力，紧密团结在中国共产党的周围，高举总路线红旗，将把我国的地质科学事业推向高峰。
