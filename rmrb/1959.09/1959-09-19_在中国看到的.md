What I Saw in China
By Zha Ao'er Si Ji, Deputy Minister of Culture and Art of the Polish People's Republic

    The wing tilted to the left, and the earth swept past again. At the airport in the green shade with many planes parked, some people standing far away waved goodbye to us. Their last farewell gestures and everything else remained behind. After a month-long visit, we bid farewell to the land of China and to our friends in Beijing. All the meetings and conversations, the people, roads, museums and factories, people's communes and kindergartens, all that enriched our observations of this great Eastern country, as well as what we praised and admired at the time, and everything that aroused our sympathy and friendship, are imprinted in our minds.

    We are deeply impressed by the extraordinary diligence, discipline, sincerity of the Chinese people and the civilization of Chinese social life, and we once again reflect on what miracles the people under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism can create and what excellent qualities they possess!

    From my professional point of view, the achievement in education is the issue that attracts my attention the most. The "Great Leap Forward" has created conditions for the popularization of education. Factories, enterprises, and communes have established tens of thousands of new schools. All those who could not read or write but were capable of learning participated in the study. For example, nearly 70% of the tens of thousands of workers in the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation participated in the study. This large-scale steel company is carrying out such a huge educational undertaking. The company has opened a university with a Department of Metallurgy, as well as several technical schools, junior and senior high schools, and many primary schools. This touching thing happened on a voluntary basis of the students. Despite the heavy workload, the desire for knowledge is still so strong, and the number of absentees is very small, usually accounting for only nearly 20%. The example of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation is very typical. We often encountered such situations during our travels. Many communes have opened agricultural specialty schools where farmers can learn and practically apply modern agricultural techniques.

    Children are a special issue. Chinese children enjoy privileges. Love for children is everywhere. Some fathers often have several children, and they are very tired after work, just like everywhere else in the world, but their care and attention to their children is unparalleled anywhere else. People smile at children they don't know, and often say some warm and affectionate words. Chinese children are already fully enjoying the benefits of the national system. Nowhere else have I encountered so many nurseries and kindergartens. For example, in a commune near Chengdu, we visited two kindergartens in a small village (one of which was scheduled to be visited, and the other was visited by chance). In these two kindergartens, there were dozens of clean, sturdy, lively, and brave children. Preschool children often stroll and play on the avenues, and passers-by always greet them with smiles and kind eyes.

    Chinese children are learning and growing into conscious citizens of the People's Republic. They are no longer damaging their health in work beyond their capabilities as their parents did in their childhood. Children all over China are learning to respect labor and cherish the fruits of labor, learning to participate in labor and the qualities and knowledge necessary for this. Every child must first develop the habit of cleanliness and order. I saw a group of preschool children who, after playing, not only put away their toys, but also picked up some small brooms and swept the place where they were playing.

    The organized participation of young people in social work can stimulate their love for labor and allow them to better participate in the great cause of socialist construction. Children are the most precious treasure of every nation. The Chinese people understand this better than anyone else.

    There is a special phenomenon in China, which I call the joy of labor. There is no doubt that in the ten years since the establishment of the people's regime, it has not been able to eradicate all the serious legacy of colonialism and feudal-bourgeois rule. Therefore, in China, in addition to the most modern joint factories or automatic machines and combine harvester factories, manual labor in industry or transportation can often be seen. This is heavy labor, just like the situation elsewhere with similar conditions. But this phenomenon arouses an unusual reaction from the working people. I have seen this kind of heavy physical labor in my country more than once. Tired workers or farmers are silent. It seems that everyone has exhausted their strength and is unwilling to talk and laugh. In China, the opposite is true. Work, especially work done collectively, is often accompanied by songs. People often sing, work hard, and work with smiles. They work with perseverance themselves, without the need for encouragement. It gives the impression that work is their duty, not to make money. Labor gives them the joy of creation, and participating in collective work is their mission in life. I think this is the main reason for the great achievements in the construction of the People's Republic of China.

    It is impossible not to point out the attitude of citizens towards the government. The Chinese are deeply convinced that the government will solve everything well, that everything will be conducive to the development of the republic, to the consolidation of the people's regime, and that it will be beneficial to him directly or indirectly. The Chinese are patriotic people, and public interest is precious to them, and often higher than personal interest. When implementing government resolutions, they always dedicate all their talents and all their strength, and respecting this resolution is a completely natural phenomenon.

    I think this fact is the result of the great prestige established by the Chinese Communist Party through its unremitting struggle for universal freedom and the struggle against Japanese imperialists, and the result of the personal prestige of the people's leaders headed by Mao Zedong. However, the correct and wise policies of the Chinese Party and government probably did not play a secondary role. Thanks to these policies, the natural disasters that have been oppressing the Chinese people for thousands of years have been overcome, and the prospects for development have been created. Now everyone can eat and dress warmly, the concept of hunger and the disaster of floods are past nightmares, infectious diseases belong to historical facts, all these facts make the people deeply believe that only the people's regime can benefit them. The fact that the government is honest, clean, and fair has even turned those who, from the point of view of class interests, could not sincerely support the government to the side of the people's regime.

    The People's Republic of China is becoming increasingly strong, and its international role and prestige are increasing and strengthening. Chinese citizens also clearly see this, and they understand that only the people's regime can guide China on the road of great development and great role, which is also the reason why this regime gains prestige and is respected.

    There are some folk legends in China that are considered impossible for anyone to do, such as conquering the Yellow River and building the Yangtze River Bridge. I saw the first Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan. This bridge was built by the people's regime in 1957, with a construction time of two years and a total length of one thousand six hundred and ten meters. Many bridges are being built on the Yangtze River, such as three bridges that will be built in Chongqing soon.

    As everyone knows, the Yellow River has been conquered and no longer devours the lives and property it used to devour.

    The elderly Chinese shake their heads, probably because they are worried that it is becoming increasingly difficult to make up fairy tales for their children. The entire Chinese people trust their government because they have a wealth of experience as a basis.

    在中国看到的
    波兰人民共和国文化艺术部副部长　札奥尔斯基
    机翼向左顷斜，大地再一次掠过眼前。在停着很多飞机的绿荫中的机场上，远远站着的一些人向我们挥手道别。他们最后的告别手势和一切东西都留在后面了。在一个月的访问之后，我们同中国的土地告别，和北京的朋友们告别了。各次会面和交谈、人们、道路、博物馆和工厂、人民公社和幼儿园，所有丰富了我们对这个东方伟大的国家的观察的东西，以及那时我们赞不绝口和使我们产生同情和友爱的一切，都印在我们的脑海之中。
    我们怀着对中国人民的不平凡的勤劳、纪律性、真诚和对中国社会生活的文明的深刻印象，又一次深思：在马克思列宁主义思想指导下的人民，能够创造出怎样的奇迹，具有多么优秀的品质啊！
    从我的职业观点来看，使我最注意的问题当然是教育方面的成就。“大跃进”给普及教育创造了条件。工厂、企业和公社建立了千万所新型的学校。所有那些还不会读、不会写但是能够进行学习的人都参加了学习。例如，在武钢工作的几万人中将近70％参加了学习。这个大规模的钢铁公司进行着如此巨大的教育工作。这个公司开办了一个设有冶金系的大学，还有几所技术学校、初级和高级普通中学，以及许多小学。这种令人感动的事情是在学生们自愿的基础上出现的。人们尽管工作繁重，但求知欲仍然是那样强烈，缺课的人数极少，通常只占将近20％。武钢的例子是很典型的。这样的情况我们在旅行中经常碰到。许多公社开办了农业专科学校，农民可以在那里学习掌握现代的农业技术并加以实际运用。
    儿童是一个专门问题。中国儿童享有特权。对儿童的热爱到处可见。有的父亲往往有几个孩子，他们在工作下班之后是很疲劳的，这同世界所有其他地方都一样，但是，他们对儿女的关心和照顾却是其他任何地方都比不上的。人们看到不认识的孩子也要微笑，并且往往还要说些温暖抚爱的话。中国儿童目前就已经完全享受到国家制度的好处。在任何别的地方都未曾碰见过这样多的托儿所和幼儿园。例如在成都附近的一个公社里，在一个不大的村庄里我们就参观了两个幼儿园（其中一个是预定要参观的，另一个是偶然参观的）。在这两个幼儿园中有好几十个干干净净、结结实实、活泼、勇敢的孩子。学前儿童时常在大道上散步游玩，过路人总是以微笑和亲切的目光迎接他们。
    中国儿童正在学习和成长为人民共和国的有觉悟的公民。他们已经不像他们的父母在童年时那样，会在力不能及的工作中使健康受到损害。全中国各地的儿童都在学习尊重劳动和珍惜劳动成果，学习参加劳动和为此所必须的品质和知识。每一个儿童首先要养成整洁和守秩序的习惯。我看到了一批学前儿童，他们在戏玩之后不仅把自己的玩具收拾起来，而且拿起一些小扫帚把游戏的地方打扫干净。
    青少年有组织地参加社会工作，这可以激发他们对劳动的热爱，让他们更好地参加伟大的社会主义建设事业。儿童是每个民族最珍贵的宝贝。中国人民比谁都更理解这一点。
    在中国有一种特别现象，我把它叫做劳动的愉快。毫无疑问，人民政权建立十年来，还没有能铲除殖民主义和封建—资产阶级统治的全部严重遗害。所以在中国除了最现代化的联合工厂或自动机器和联合收割机工厂，还常常可以看到工业或运输业中的手工劳动。这是沉重的劳动，正和条件类似的别处的情况一样。但是这一现象激起劳动人民异乎寻常的反应。我不只一次在我国也看见这种沉重的体力劳动。疲劳的工人或农民默默无言。好像大家把自己的力量都用完了，不乐意谈笑。在中国则相反。工作，特别是集体完成的工作常常伴随着歌声。人们常常唱着歌、努力并且带着笑容在工作。他们自己以坚毅的精神劳动，而不需要鼓动。给人一个印象：工作是他们的天职，而不是为了赚钱。劳动给他们以创造的愉快，参加共同的工作是他们生活中的使命。我想，这是中华人民共和国建设中获得伟大成就的主要原因。
    不能不指出公民对政府的态度。中国人深信，政府会把一切都解决得很好，一切都会有利于共和国的发展、有利于巩固人民政权，并且不是直接便是间接地有利于他本人。中国人是富有爱国热情的人，公共利益对他们来说是珍贵的，而且常常高于个人利益。在执行政府决议时，他们总是献出自己的全部才智和全部力量，尊重这个决议是完全自然的现象。
    我觉得，这一事实是中国共产党通过自己争取普遍自由的不懈斗争和反对日本帝国主义者的斗争所树立起来的巨大威信的结果，是以毛泽东为首的人民领袖们的个人威信的结果。但是，中国党和政府的正确而英明的政策恐怕不是起了次要的作用，由于这些政策，战胜了几千年来一直压迫着中国人民的自然灾害，并且创造了发展的远景。现在所有人都能吃饱穿暖，饥饿的概念和洪水成灾已是过去的恶梦，传染病已属于历史事实，所有这些事实使人民深深地相信，只有人民政权才能为他们谋福利。政府是诚实、廉洁和公正的，这一事实甚至使那些从阶级利益观点来看不可能衷心拥护政府的人也转到了人民政权方面。
    中华人民共和国日益强盛，它的国际作用和声望日益提高和加强。中国公民也很清楚地看到了这点，他们懂得，只有人民政权才能够引导中国走上巨大发展和发生大作用的道路，这也是这个政权获得威信和受到尊重的原因。
    中国民间传奇中有一些被认为谁也做不了的事，如征服黄河和建筑长江大桥。我看见了武汉的第一座长江大桥。这座大桥是由人民政权在1957年建成的，建筑时间两年，全长一千六百一十米。在长江上正在建筑许多桥梁，如重庆马上就要建筑三座桥梁。
    大家知道，黄河已经被征服了，不再吞噬它过去经常吞噬的生命财产了。
    中国的老年人摇摇头，大概他们由于要给自己的孩儿编童话越来越难而感到发愁。全体中国人民信任自己的政府，因为他们有丰富的经验作为依据。
