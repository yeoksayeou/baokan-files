    Promoting Further Development of Romanian Industry
    Comprehensive Construction of the Borzesti Joint Factory
    (Our dispatch from Bucharest, September 13) The Borzesti Petrochemical Joint Factory in Romania is under full-scale construction, accelerating its development.

    This joint factory, covering an area of one thousand hectares, is currently Romania's largest basic construction project. More than 10,000 workers and technicians are working intensely on the construction site, and more than 2,000 urban and rural youths are participating in voluntary labor here. This joint factory includes a synthetic rubber plant, a polyvinyl chloride manufacturing plant, a soda plant, an oil refinery, a power plant, and workshops for manufacturing carbolic acid, acetone, insecticides, and herbicides. The raw materials for this joint factory are natural gas, petroleum, and salt. Once fully completed, it will be able to produce more than 160,000 tons of products annually, with a total product value of 2.6 billion lei. The machinery and equipment for the joint factory are supplied by the Soviet Union.

    Currently, the joint factory's power plant is partially in operation. When fully completed, its power generation capacity will be 225,000 kilowatts, which is greater than the power generation capacity of the "Lenin" Hydroelectric Station, which is under construction. The synthetic rubber plant and the soda plant have already begun installing machinery and equipment. The insecticide workshop can be put into production this year, with an annual output of 1,250 tons. The polyvinyl chloride workshop will be partially put into production this year, with a maximum production capacity of 36,000 tons per year. The 20-kilometer large-scale pipeline from the Slanic salt mine to the factory has been completed. This salt mine, which can provide enough salt for the world's population for 500 years, will supply the chemical joint factory with ample raw materials. A worker's city that can accommodate 30,000 people will be established near the joint factory, and hundreds of housing units have already been built.

    促进罗马尼亚工业进一步发展
    博尔泽斯蒂联合工厂全面施工
    本报布加勒斯特13日电　罗马尼亚的博尔泽斯蒂石油化学联合厂正在全面施工，加速建设。
    这个占地一千公顷的联合厂是罗马尼亚目前最大的基本建设工程。现在有一万多工人和技术人员在工地上紧张工作，还有两千多名城乡青年在这里参加义务劳动。这个联合厂包括一个合成橡胶厂，一个多聚氯乙烯制造厂，一个制碱厂，一个炼油厂，一个发电厂和制造石碳酸、丙酮、杀虫剂、除莠剂的车间各一个。这个联合厂的原料是天然气、石油和盐。在全部建成后，每年能生产十六万吨以上的产品，产品总值达二十六亿列伊。联合厂的机器设备是由苏联供给的。
    现在，联合厂的发电厂已部分投入生产，在全部建成后发电能力为二十二万五千瓩，比正在建设中的“列宁”水电站的发电能力还大。合成橡胶厂和制碱厂已经开始安装机器设备。杀虫剂车间今年可以投入生产，年产一千二百五十吨。聚氯乙烯车间今年内将部分投入生产，它的最大生产能力是每年三万六千吨。从斯拉尼克盐矿到工厂的二十公里大型道管已经建成。这个可供全世界人口食用五百年的盐矿将供给这个化学联合厂充足的原料。在联合厂附近将建立一座可供三万人居住的工人城，现在已经建成了数百套住宅。
