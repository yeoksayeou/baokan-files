Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch: According to a report by the German News Agency: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was held from September 18 to 19.

Alois Pisnik delivered a report at the meeting on behalf of the Central Political Bureau.

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "The Law of the Seven-Year Plan and the Tasks of Party Organizations in Implementing Industrial Plans."

The Central Committee approved the report of the Central Political Bureau and the report of Ulbricht, and decided to submit the draft law on the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic to the Council of Ministers.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 23rd: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, recently reported at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party that the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy (1959-1965) shows all the people the path to carry out socialist construction in order to achieve socialist victory in 1965. He pointed out that the seven-year plan will be formally approved on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

The "Neues Deutschland" published Ulbricht's report on the 22nd, entitled "The Principles of the Seven-Year Plan and the Party's Tasks in Implementing Industrial Plans."

Ulbricht said that the seven-year plan guarantees the realization of the following main economic tasks:

The total value of consumer goods supply in 1961 will increase from 39.6 billion marks in 1958 to 51 billion marks, and then to 66 billion marks in 1965.

By 1965, due to wage increases and price reductions, the real wages of workers and staff nationwide will increase by 60% to 65%.

Pensions and other allowances will increase by approximately 55% compared to 1958.

Working hours will be further shortened. Ulbricht said that today, the main task of a truly peaceful policy is to realize the seven-year plan, strengthen the German Democratic Republic, make it a fortress of peace, and make it a base for Germany to become a peace-loving and democratic country again.

Ulbricht pointed out that the national significance of the draft seven-year plan lies in the fact that the people of the German Democratic Republic will show all the German people and the world that the German people can live in peace, prosperity, and happiness, and that it is possible for them to abandon West German imperialist aggression and territorial demands, and abandon revanchism, atomic armament, and militarism.

The reporter said that the Fifth Party Congress's decision on the main figures of the seven-year plan stimulated the great creativity of workers, intellectuals, peasants, and handicraftsmen. After this congress, the party conducted very serious discussions with the broad masses in factories, rural areas, schools, and trade unions. Therefore, this seven-year plan is the manifestation of the collective wisdom of the party, the government, and the people, and is the result of applying Marxist-Leninist theory, using the experience of socialist planning, and developing the creativity of the working people. This is the essence of our vibrant people's democracy.

Ulbricht then talked about the important significance of socialist labor collectives and socialist labor teams.

Ulbricht said that as of September 1st this year, 26,237 work teams were striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," and these work teams had a total of 302,176 members. In addition, 16,459 socialist labor collectives have been established, with 139,312 workers, scientists, and engineers as members. He said that socialist labor teams and socialist labor collectives are the main reliance for solving all the important tasks of the seven-year plan. All party organizations must strive to make the nature and social tasks of these labor teams and labor collectives ideologically clear. The spirit of these labor teams and labor collectives should be extended to government and economic organs.

When talking about basic economic issues, Ulbricht pointed out that the latest scientific and technological knowledge should be used to improve labor productivity. He said that in the next seven years, the increase in total production must be achieved without increasing the number of workers in service.

He also pointed out that socialist reconstruction is currently the most concrete form of struggle to improve labor productivity. The reconstruction plan submitted to the Central Committee is the basis for this struggle that has already begun.

Ulbricht said that we must carry out two kinds of socialist reconstruction: equipping factories and departments with the most modern machinery; and reorganizing and modernizing existing factories.

He said that the responsibilities of the state's local power organs in implementing the seven-year plan should be clearly defined. Democratic centralism must be further developed and local institutions given more power.

Ulbricht then talked about the tasks of the party's grassroots organizations in implementing the seven-year plan. He said that everything will now depend on the supervision of the party and state organs. The role of the party's grassroots organizations should be strengthened so that they can mobilize the masses to complete tasks and supervise economic organs to improve their work. Party leading organs and grassroots organizations should not stop at general supervision of total output, but should conduct supervision in terms of the highest level of technology and production, product quality, cost reduction, export, and guarantee conditions for cooperation.

Ulbricht finally talked about the production development situation in the first nine months of this year. He said that the development speed of many sectors of our national economy has currently exceeded the provisions of the plan. The total output value target of the second five-year plan, which was originally scheduled to be completed by 1960, can be achieved by the end of this year.

In the first eight months of this year, the total industrial output value was almost equal to the output value increased in the entire year of 1958. In the last two months, the industrial production growth rate was 14%. The output value of the construction industry in the first eight months of this year increased by 20% compared with the same period last year.

Ulbricht finally emphasized that all these achievements are due to the new and great labor enthusiasm that the working people have displayed since the Fifth Party Congress.

    乌布利希在德国统一社会党中央全会上指出
    七年计划为德国人民开辟幸福远景
    今年年底将提前一年完成五年计划总产值指标
    据新华社柏林电　据德意志通讯社报道：德国统一社会党中央委员会第六次全体会议9月18日至19日举行。
    阿洛伊斯·皮斯尼克在会上代表中央政治局作了报告。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在会上作了题为“七年计划的法律以及党组织执行工业方面的计划的任务”的报告。
    中央委员会批准了中央政治局的报告和乌布利希的报告，并且决定将德意志民主共和国发展国民经济的七年计划法律草案提交部长会议。
    新华社柏林23日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希最近在统一社会党六中全会上作报告说，发展国民经济的七年计划（1959—1965年）向全体人民展示了开展社会主义建设，以便在1965年取得社会主义胜利的道路。他指出，七年计划将在德意志民主共和国成立十周年的时候正式批准。
    “新德意志报”22日刊登了乌布利希的这篇题为“七年计划的原则以及党在执行工业计划方面的任务”的报告。
    乌布利希说，七年计划保证实现下列主要的经济任务：
    1961年消费品供应量的总值将由1958年的三百九十六亿马克增加到五百一十亿马克，1965年再增到六百六十亿马克。
    到1965年，由于工资提高和物价减低，全国职工的实际工资将增加60％到65％。
    养老金和其他津贴将比1958年增加大约55％。
    工作时间将进一步缩短。乌布利希说，今天，真正和平政策的主要任务是实现七年计划，加强德意志民主共和国，使之成为和平的堡垒，成为使德国重新成为一个爱好和平和民主的国家的基地。
    乌布利希指出，七年计划草案的全国性的重要意义在于：德意志民主共和国人民将向全体德国人民和全世界表明，德国人民能够在和平、繁荣和幸福中生活，并且表明，他们有可能摒弃西德帝国主义的侵略和领土要求，摒弃复仇主义、原子军备和军国主义。
    报告人说，第五次党代表大会关于七年计划主要数字的决定激发了工人、知识分子、农民和手工业者的巨大创造性。在这次代表大会以后，党同工厂、农村、学校和工会的广大群众进行了非常认真的讨论。因此，这个七年计划是党、政府和人民的集体智慧的表现，是应用马克思列宁主义理论、运用社会主义计划的经验和发挥劳动人民创造性的结果。这是我们生气勃勃的人民民主的本质。
    乌布利希接着谈到社会主义劳动集体和社会主义劳动队的重要意义。
    乌布利希说，到今年9月1日，有二万六千二百三十七个工作队在争取“社会主义劳动队”的称号，这些工作队共有三十万另二千一百七十六个队员。此外，已经建立了一万六千四百五十九个社会主义劳动集体，其成员为十三万九千三百一十二名工人、科学家和工程师。他说，社会主义劳动队和社会主义劳动集体是解决七年计划全部重要任务的主要依靠。一切党组织必须设法使这些劳动队和劳动集体的性质和社会任务在思想上明确起来。这种劳动队和劳动集体的精神应该扩大到政府和经济机关中去。
    乌布利希在谈到基本经济问题时指出，要利用最新的科学技术知识来提高劳动生产率。他说，在今后七年期间，生产总量的增加必须在不增加在职的工人人数的情况下达到。
    他又指出，社会主义改建是目前为提高劳动生产率而斗争的最具体的形式。提交中央委员会的改建计划是现在已经开始的这种斗争的基础。
    乌布利希说，我们必须进行两种社会主义改建：用最现代化的机器来装备各工厂和部门；现有工厂的改组和现代化。
    他说，应该明确规定国家的地方权力机关在执行七年计划方面的责任。必须进一步发扬民主集中制并给予地方机构以较多的权力。
    乌布利希接着谈到党的基层组织在执行七年计划中的任务。他说，现在一切将有赖于党和国家机构的监督。应该加强党基层组织的作用，以便使它们能够动员群众完成任务和监督经济机关改进工作。党领导机关和基层组织不应停留在对总产量的一般监督上面，而应当就技术和生产的最高水平、产品质量、降低成本、出口和合作的保证条件等方面进行监督。
    乌布利希最后谈到今年九个月的生产发展情况。他说，我国国民经济许多部门的发展速度目前已经超过了计划的规定。原来规定到1960年完成的第二个五年计划的总产值指标到今年年底就能实现。
    今年的头八个月，工业总产值几乎和1958年全年增长的产值相等。在最近两个月里，工业生产增长率是14％。建筑业产值在今年头八个月里比去年同期增加了20％。
    乌布利希最后强调说，所有这些成就，是由于劳动人民在第五次党代表大会之后发挥了新的巨大的劳动干劲而取得的。
