(Editor's note: The practice of the Yangjiatan People's Commune is very good and worth promoting. Appropriately limiting the self-sufficiency of members and increasing the commodity portion as much as possible can not only increase the commune's cash income, but also increase the supply of commodities to cities. This is another concrete manifestation of strengthening mutual assistance and cooperation between cities and villages, workers and peasants.)

    (Our newspaper report) The Yangjiatan Commune in Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, based on the principle of diligence and thrift in running the commune and managing households, rationally arranges the self-sufficiency consumption of the commune and its members, and sells more agricultural and sideline products to the state.
    Since the establishment of the commune last year, the commune has conscientiously implemented the production policy of simultaneously promoting self-sufficient production and commodity production, vigorously increasing production and practicing economy, promoting a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, thus greatly increasing the commodity volume. From January to September 10th this year, the total value of agricultural and sideline products sold to the state by the entire commune reached 1.76 million yuan (including 480,000 yuan of marketable grain), accounting for about 30% of the commune's total agricultural and sideline output value during this period, exceeding the original commodity sales plan by 40%, and increasing by 98% compared with the same period last year. The commune sold 2,752 pigs, an increase of 70% compared with the same period last year; 2,516 dan of tea, an increase of 26%; and 7,350 dan of native paper, an increase of nearly 15%. The commodity rate of other non-staple foods such as chickens, ducks, fresh fish, and fresh eggs has also greatly increased compared with last year as production has increased. This has not only powerfully supported the national plan and increased market supply, but also increased the income of the commune and its members, fully demonstrating the superiority of the people's commune.
    The main reason why the commodity volume of agricultural and sideline products in this commune can be expanded compared with the same period last year is that it has consistently implemented the principle of increasing production, practicing economy, and running the commune diligently and thriftily. This year, the average yield per mu of early rice on more than 43,000 mu of land in the commune was 467 jin, an increase of more than 20% compared with last year; the average yield per mu of middle rice on more than 23,000 mu of land was 513 jin, an increase of nearly 30% compared with last year. A bumper harvest of late rice, summer sweet potatoes, and autumn miscellaneous grains is very promising. The area of cash crops such as sugarcane, jute, peanuts, sun-cured tobacco, and cotton has been expanded by 50% compared with last year. There are 221 diverse operations in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, an increase of 139 compared with before communization. Among the 238 large and small factories run by the commune and teams, many produce daily-use industrial products and process non-staple foods. As of early September, the industrial output value reached more than 2.85 million yuan. In terms of animal husbandry, the commune raised more than 46,000 pigs, an increase of 30% compared with the same period last year; raised more than 210,000 chickens and ducks, an increase of 64%; and raised 20 million fish, an increase of 50%. In addition, rabbits and goats have also been raised.
    The commune party committee frequently conducts publicity and education among commune members on running the commune diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily, so that the masses understand the great significance of increasing production and saving consumption. In particular, after the publication of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, it further encouraged the enthusiasm of the commune members and sold more agricultural and sideline products to the state. Now, the delivery task for the third quarter has been overfulfilled. The commune has also concentrated a group of commune members with vegetable growing skills to expand the planting of marketable vegetables to ensure a continuous supply to meet market needs. In the past eight months, the commune has used the income from commodity production to purchase a large number of means of production such as irrigation and drainage machinery, small power generation equipment (for processing), and pesticide machinery, and has established comprehensive iron-wood-bamboo factories, pesticide factories, and indigenous fertilizer factories, etc., and distributed more than 630,000 yuan in wages. The balance of deposits of commune members in the credit cooperative is more than 130,000 yuan, an increase of 50% compared with the same period last year. At the same time, the commune's welfare undertakings have also developed to a certain extent.

    杨家滩公社合理安排社员消费
    少吃多卖增加商品量
    今年八个月出售量比去年同期增长百分之九十八
    编者按：杨家滩人民公社的做法很好，值得提倡。适当限制社员自给部分，尽可能增加商品部分，不仅可以增加公社的现金收入，而且能增加城市商品供应量。这是加强城市和乡村、工人和农民之间互助合作的又一具体表现。
    本报讯　湖南涟源县杨家滩公社根据勤俭办社勤俭持家的原则，合理安排社和社员们自给消费，把更多的农副业产品出售给国家。
    这个公社自去年建社以来，认真贯彻执行了自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的生产方针，厉行增产节约，促使农林牧副渔全面大跃进，因而商品量大大的增长。全社从今年元月到9月10日止，向国家出售的农副产品的总值达一百七十六万元（其中商品粮四十八万元），约占这个时期全社农副总产值的30％，超过原订商品出售计划40％，比去年同期增长了98％。全社出售生猪二千七百五十二头，比去年同期增长70％；茶叶二千五百十六担，增长26％；土纸七千三百五十担，增长近15％。其他鸡鸭、鲜鱼、鲜蛋等副食品，随着产量的增多，商品率比去年也都有很大的增长。这不仅有力地支援了国家计划，增加了市场供应，而且增加了社和社员收入，充分显示了人民公社的优越性。
    这个公社农副产品商品量能够比去年同期扩大，主要是自始至终贯彻执行了增产节约、勤俭办社的原则。今年全社四万三千多亩早稻，平均亩产四百六十七斤，比去年增产两成以上；二万三千多亩中稻，平均亩产五百十三斤，比去年增产近三成。晚稻、夏红薯、秋杂作物丰收大有把握，甘蔗、黄麻、花生、晒烟、棉花等经济作物比去年扩大了50％的面积。林、牧、副、渔等多种经营二百二十一项，比公社化前增加了一百三十九项。社办和队办大小工厂二百三十八个中，有不少是生产日用工业品和加工副食品的，到9月上旬止，工业产值达二百八十五万多元。畜牧方面，全社养猪四万六千多头，比去年同期增长30％；饲养鸡鸭二十一万多只，增长64％；养鱼两千万尾，增长50％；此外，还增养了兔子和山羊。
    公社党委经常向社员进行勤俭办社和勤俭持家的宣传教育，使群众懂得增加生产、节约消费的重大意义。特别是党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议公布以后，更加鼓舞了社员们的积极性，出售了更多的农副产品给国家。现在，第三季度的交售任务已经超额完成。全社还集中了一部分有种菜技术的社员扩种商品蔬菜，保证源源不断地供应市场需要。八个多月来，全社利用商品生产收入，购回了排灌机械、小型发电设备（加工用）、农药械等大批生产资料，兴办了铁木竹综合工厂、农药厂、土化肥厂等，发放了六十三万多元工资。社员在信用部的存款余额有十三万多元，比去年同期增长了50％。同时全社的生活福利事业也有一定的发展。
