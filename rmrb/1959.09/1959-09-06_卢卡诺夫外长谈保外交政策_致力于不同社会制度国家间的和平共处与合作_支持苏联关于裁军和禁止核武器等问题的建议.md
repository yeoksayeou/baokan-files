Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 4th -- The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported that Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov stated that the foundation of Bulgaria's foreign policy is the Leninist principle of complete equality between countries and nations, recognizing their sovereignty and independence, non-interference in internal affairs, and peaceful coexistence and cooperation between countries with different social systems and national systems.

Lukanov made these remarks when answering questions from a Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reporter regarding Bulgaria's foreign policy.

When discussing Bulgaria's position on major issues in the current international situation, Lukanov said that our country has consistently and unconditionally supported the Soviet Union's peaceful activities in the past, and will continue to do so in the future, because this is in the interest of all the people of the world (including the Bulgarian people), and because this is the requirement of world peace.

The People's Republic of Bulgaria believes that the issue of disarmament and banning nuclear weapons is one of the most important issues in the current international situation. In order to free the world from the threat of the most brutal atomic war in human history, it fully supports the Soviet Union's proposals for resolving these issues. Bulgaria firmly supports the proposition of establishing a European collective security system and supports the proposal for concluding a mutual non-aggression treaty between member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and member states of the Warsaw Treaty.

He added that the Bulgarian people are very concerned about resolving the German question through peaceful and democratic means. Therefore, we fully support the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic in their struggle to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and eliminate the remnants of the occupation regime in West Berlin.

Lukanov then pointed out that the Bulgarian government has consistently pursued a policy of making the Balkan Peninsula a region of lasting peace and security. The aim of Bulgaria's foreign policy towards all its neighbors is to improve and expand political, economic, and cultural ties.

Lukanov said, "We believe that the positive development of international relations in the recent period, especially the upcoming meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, cannot but have an impact on the situation in the Balkans. It goes without saying how beneficial the realization of Romania's proposal to hold a summit of Balkan countries to discuss and conclude an agreement on collective cooperation and security in the Balkan region would be for the cause of peace in the Balkans and Europe. The conclusion of this agreement would be welcomed by all Balkan peoples, as they long for lasting peace and future security."

Lukanov also spoke about the significance of Bulgaria's friendly and cooperative relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and pointed out Bulgaria's growing prestige on the international stage.

    卢卡诺夫外长谈保外交政策
    致力于不同社会制度国家间的和平共处与合作
    支持苏联关于裁军和禁止核武器等问题的建议
    新华社索非亚4日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫说，保加利亚外交政策的基础是各国和各民族之间完全平等的列宁主义原则，承认它们的主权和独立、互不干涉内政，不同社会制度和国家制度的国家之间的和平共处与合作。
    卢卡诺夫是在回答保加利亚通讯社记者问时谈到保加利亚的外交政策时说的。
    卢卡诺夫在谈到保加利亚对当前国际局势中主要问题的立场时说，我国过去一贯无条件地支持苏联的和平活动，今后也仍然如此，因为这符合全世界人民（其中包括保加利亚人民）的利益，因为这是全世界和平利益的要求。
    保加利亚人民共和国认为，裁军和禁止核武器问题是当前国际局势中最重要的问题之一，为了使世界摆脱人类历史上最残酷的原子战争的威胁，它完全支持苏联关于解决这些问题的建议。保加利亚坚决支持建立欧洲集体安全体系的主张，并支持关于在北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约缔约国之间缔结互不侵犯条约的建议。
    他又说，保加利亚人民十分关切用和平与民主的办法解决德国问题。因此，我们完全支持苏联和德意志民主共和国在争取缔结对德和约和消除西柏林占领制度残余的斗争。
    卢卡诺夫接着指出，保加利亚政府一贯执行使巴尔干半岛成为持久和平与安全地区的政策，保加利亚对所有邻国的外交政策的宗旨是改善和扩大政治、经济和文化的联系。
    卢卡诺夫说，我们相信，最近期间国际关系的积极发展，特别是赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔之间将要举行的会见，对巴尔干的局势不能不产生影响。实现罗马尼亚提出的关于举行巴尔干国家首脑会议来讨论和缔结巴尔干地区集体合作与安全协定的建议，会给巴尔干和欧洲的和平事业带来多大的好处，这一点是毋庸赘言的。缔结这个协定会受到所有巴尔干人民的欢迎，因为他们热望持久和平与将来的安全。
    卢卡诺夫还谈到了保加利亚同苏联及其他社会主义国家的友好合作关系的意义，指出了保加利亚在国际舞台上日益增长的威望。
