The Vietnamese People Are Advancing Triumphantly
Xu Zhizhen, Head of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Delegation to Vietnam

As it was late summer and early autumn, when northern Vietnam was a riot of color, we were honored to be invited by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor to make our first friendly visit to the beautiful and rich Democratic Republic of Vietnam for seventeen days. During our visit, we were met everywhere with brotherly warm welcomes and cordial hospitality from the Vietnamese people. Wherever we went, we saw many friendly faces smiling at us, and many elderly people, women, and children waving to us. This precious friendship made us deeply appreciate the sincere love of the Vietnamese people for the Chinese people, leaving us with an indelible impression.

In an extraordinarily friendly atmosphere, we traveled to many places with excitement and gratitude, almost all over the major cities and factories of northern Vietnam. During our visits, we saw that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's three-year plan for developing and transforming the economy and developing culture, which began in 1958, was being implemented smoothly and had achieved great successes. We visited the Hanoi Medium Machine Factory and were pleased to see that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam already had its own machine manufacturing industry; in Haiphong, we saw the large-scale cement plant, a vital material production sector for infrastructure construction; in Hong Gai, surrounded by turquoise waters, we saw the rich coal seams. The Vinh City power plant, equipped with modern new equipment, had already been put into production at the beginning of the three-year plan. These core industries and important industrial sectors for the development of the national economy have been established and are developing rapidly. The products of these factories are not only increasing in quantity but also improving in quality. For example, the product qualification rate of the Hanoi Medium Machine Factory has reached 98%. These factories have laid a good foundation for the development of the national economy. For example, the Vinh City power plant supplied electricity to seventeen pumping stations this year, irrigating more than 28,000 hectares of rice paddies and changing the situation of crop failures in these areas during the dry season. Nam Dinh is the center of Vietnam's textile industry. In the past few years, the number of looms has almost doubled, and the output has more than doubled compared to 1956. Other products such as enamel, knitwear, and matches, which were not produced in the past, have now begun to be produced and are supplying the people's growing needs in large quantities.

While visiting more than a dozen factories and mining enterprises, we made a special trip to Nghe An province, the cradle of the Vietnamese revolution. Here, on September 12, 1930, under the leadership of the Party, the broad revolutionary masses launched an armed uprising, held high the banner of the Soviets, and established Soviet power, thus opening a new era in the Vietnamese proletarian revolution. However, this revolutionary regime was extinguished by the enemy's counter-revolutionary armed forces not long after its birth, and hundreds and thousands of revolutionary heroes shed their last drop of blood for the revolution. However, under the leadership of the Party, the Vietnamese people followed in the footsteps of the martyrs, struggling arduously for more than twenty years to achieve national liberation and the ideals of socialism and communism, and traversing tortuous and complex roads. The Vietnamese people persevered in the eight-year War of Resistance, inflicting serious blows on the French aggressors and thwarting the conspiracy of American imperialism to interfere and attempt to expand the Vietnam War. In 1954, according to the Geneva Conference agreement, a ceasefire was gradually realized throughout Indochina. In May 1955, after the withdrawal of the French invading forces, all of northern Vietnam was liberated.

On the morning of September 11, we braved the rain to visit President Ho Chi Minh's hometown in the suburbs of Vinh City. President Ho's former residence was very simple, with only three thatched cottages, furnished only with a wooden plank bed on which he slept as a child and photos of his father and brother. Ho Chi Minh's original name was Nguyen Sinh Cung. He left his hometown at the age of fifteen, and it was not until the August Revolution of 1945 when President Ho officially announced the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Ba Dinh Square in Hanoi that people knew about President Ho. President Ho Chi Minh is the leader most sincerely loved by the Vietnamese people and also the most loyal friend of the Chinese people. After visiting his former residence, we felt that his glorious life was worthy of our good study.

We also made a special visit to two agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives is growing rapidly. The fields in the Red River Delta, endless rice paddies, after the bumper early rice harvest this year, are again showing signs of a great harvest.

Farmers like to reminisce. In their happy lives, they cannot forget the suffering of the old society. Someone told me that during the era of French colonial rule, their poverty was famous in Asia. Among the poor peasants, about ten households had only one plow, and half of the households had no draught animals. It is said that in one year of famine, more than one million people starved to death. From such a miserable situation, one can imagine the tragic fate of the Vietnamese people at that time. This was the evil result of French imperialism. This is now a bygone historical relic. Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh, in just a few short years, the vast number of peasants in northern Vietnam have entered a happy paradise.

After more than two weeks of visits, we learned that the various levels of trade union organizations in Vietnam are relatively sound, and we also saw with our own eyes that Vietnamese workers and people are striving with a hundredfold confidence and soaring enthusiasm to complete and overfulfill the production targets stipulated in the national plan for 1959. Under the correct leadership and education of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the political and ideological awareness of workers and staff members has been continuously improved. In the vigorous labor emulation campaign, workers and staff members have put forward thousands of rationalization proposals and inventions. Old production quotas are constantly being broken, technological innovations are increasing, and thousands of advanced collectives, labor models, and advanced producers have emerged. The work of improving enterprise management has been carried out very effectively, labor productivity and product quality have been further improved, and costs have been reduced. The leadership of the Party has been strengthened, and the enthusiasm of the masses of workers and staff members has been fully mobilized, which has made the Vietnamese national economy develop vigorously.

With the development of production, the masses of workers and staff members have launched a high tide of cultural learning. We have seen that all factories and rural areas have now eliminated illiteracy. Many workers and peasants are participating in elementary, higher elementary, and secondary school cultural studies, and they are also very enthusiastic about learning technology. While doing a good job in production, all factories and mines have also paid attention to improving the material and cultural lives of workers and staff members. With the government's second increase in the wages of workers and staff members, the lives of workers and staff members have improved.

On September 2, we celebrated the National Day of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam together with the Vietnamese people and workers. On that day, we saw the parade of hundreds of thousands of people, warmly cheering and celebrating their country's National Day, fully demonstrating their heartfelt love for the Vietnamese Labor Party and the great leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh. This is a concrete manifestation of the close unity of the Vietnamese people around the Labor Party and a great driving force and source of all the victories of the Vietnamese people.

From cities to villages, prosperous and beautiful scenes are appearing everywhere. Under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, after only a few years of hard work and courageous struggle, the Vietnamese people have fundamentally changed the face of the country and the lives of the people. This proves that the road of Marxism-Leninism is the road to victory. We are infinitely pleased and encouraged by the great achievements made by the fraternal Vietnamese people.

During our visit to Vietnam, we learned a lot. In particular, the industrious, brave, and hardworking style of the Vietnamese people is worthy of our admiration and worthy of our learning. We are now conveying the brilliant achievements and fraternal friendship of the Vietnamese people to our workers and all the people in order to promote our country's socialist construction.

We highly cherish the traditional friendship between the people of China and Vietnam, which is as close as brothers, sharing weal and woe, and sharing security and danger. In the cause of socialist construction and the struggle against imperialist aggression and for the defense of peace, the Chinese people will always stand together with the fraternal Vietnamese people. The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to achieve national reunification. The aggressive forces of American imperialism must get out of South Vietnam, and the Geneva Accords must be thoroughly implemented!

    高歌猛进的越南人民
    中华全国总工会访越代表团团长　许之桢
    正当夏末秋初、越南北方万紫千红的时候，我们很荣幸，应越南总工会的邀请，第一次在美丽富饶的越南民主共和国，进行了十七天的友好访问。在我们访问期间，到处受到了越南人民兄弟般的热情的欢迎和亲切的款待。无论我们走到什么地方，都见到许多友好的面孔向我们微笑，许多老人、妇女和儿童向我们招手致意。这种珍贵的友情，使我们深深地体会到越南人民对中国人民诚挚的爱，给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    在异常友好的气氛当中，我们带着兴奋而感激的心情走了许多地方，几乎走遍了整个越南北方的主要城市和工厂。我们在参观访问中间看到，从1958年开始的越南民主共和国发展和改造经济、发展文化的三年计划正在顺利执行，并已取得了巨大成就。我们参观了河内中型机器厂，高兴地看到越南民主共和国已经有了自己的机器制造业；在海防看到了基本建设重要物质生产部门规模宏大的水泥厂；在为碧绿的海水环绕的鸿基，我们看到了蕴藏丰富的煤层。荣市的具有现代新式装备的发电厂，已在三年计划开始时投入了生产。这些发展国民经济的心脏工业和重要工业部门已经建立起来，并日新月异的发展着。这些工厂的产品，不仅数量日益增多，而且质量日益提高。如河内中型机器厂产品质量合格率已达到98％。这些工厂已为国民经济的发展奠定了良好的基础。例如荣市发电厂，今年供应了十七个抽水站的电力，灌溉了二万八千多公顷稻田，改变了这些地区旱季歉收的情况。南定是越南纺织工业中心，几年来织布机已增加了将近一倍，产量已比1956年提高了一倍多。其他如搪瓷、针织、火柴等生产都是过去所没有的，现在已开始生产，大量供应人民日益增长的需要。
    在我们参观访问十多个厂矿企业的同时，我们特别到了越南革命策源地的宜安省。在这里，1930年9月12日，广大的革命群众在党的领导下，曾经武装起义，高举着苏维埃的旗帜，成立了苏维埃政权，从而开辟了越南无产阶级革命的新纪元。但是，这个革命政权诞生不久，就被敌人的反革命武装所扑灭，于是成百成千的革命英雄们，为了革命流尽了他们最后一滴血。但是，越南人民在党的领导下，踏着先烈们的血迹，为争取民族解放和实现社会主义和共产主义的理想，经过了二十多年的长期艰苦奋斗，走过了迂回曲折复杂的道路。越南人民坚持了八年抗战，给予法国侵略者以严重的打击，粉碎了美帝国主义的干涉和企图扩大越南战争的阴谋。1954年，根据日内瓦会议协议，印度支那全境逐步实现了停战。1955年5月，法国侵略军撤退后，越南北方全部获得解放。
    9月11日上午，我们冒雨到荣市郊区参观了胡志明主席的故乡。胡主席的故居很简陋，只有三间茅草房，里面陈设的只有他童年时代睡觉的一张木板床和他父亲、哥哥的照片。胡志明主席原名阮生功，他从十五岁起离开了家乡，一直到1945年八月革命胡主席在河内“巴亭广场”正式宣布越南民主共和国成立时，人们才知道胡主席的消息。胡志明主席是越南人民最衷心爱戴的领袖，也是中国人民最忠实的朋友。我们参观了他的故居之后，我们觉得他光辉的一生，是值得人们好好学习的。
    我们也特地参观了两个农业生产合作社，参加合作社的农户正在迅速增长。红河流域的原野，一望无际的稻田，继今年早稻丰收之后，又呈现了大丰收的景象。
    农民们是喜欢回忆的，在幸福的生活中，他们忘不了旧社会的痛苦。有人告诉我，在法国殖民主义者统治的时代，他们的穷苦程度，在亚洲是出名的。在贫农中，大约十户人家才有一张犁，有一半农户没有任何耕畜。据说有一年灾荒，活活地饿死了一百多万人。从这样一种可怜的情况里，可以想像出越南人民当时悲惨的命运。这是法帝国主义统治的恶果。现在这已是一去不复返的历史陈迹了。在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党中央的正确领导下，只不过短短几年的时间，越南北方广大的农民就走进了幸福的乐园。
    我们经过两个多星期的参观访问，了解越南工会各级组织都较健全，也亲眼看到了越南工人和人民，正以百倍的信心，冲天的干劲，力争完成和超额完成国家计划中所规定的1959年的生产指标。在越南劳动党的正确领导和教育下，职工的政治思想觉悟不断提高。在轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛中，职工提出了千万条合理化建议和创造发明。旧的生产定额不断被突破，技术革新日益增多，已涌现出千万个先进集体、劳动模范和先进生产者。改进企业管理的工作进行得很有成效，劳动生产率和产品质量进一步得到提高，成本得到降低。党的领导加强了，职工群众的积极性充分发挥了，这就使越南国民经济日益蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。
    随着生产的发展，职工群众已掀起了学习文化的高潮。我们看到各个工厂和农村，现在已全部扫除了文盲。许多工人和农民参加了初小、高小和中学文化学习，学习技术的劲头也很高。各厂矿在搞好生产的同时，也都注意了职工的物质文化生活的改善。随着政府二次增加职工工资，职工生活已有了改善。
    9月2日，我们同越南人民和工人一起欢庆越南民主共和国国庆节。那天，我们看到十几万群众的游行队伍，热烈欢呼，庆祝自己祖国的国庆，充分表现了对越南劳动党和越南人民伟大的领袖胡志明主席衷心的爱戴。这是越南人民紧密地团结在劳动党周围的具体表现，是越南人民取得一切胜利的伟大动力和源泉。
    从城市到乡村，处处都出现繁荣美好的景象。越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的英明领导下，经过短短的几年来的辛勤劳动，勇往直前的奋斗，使国家和人民的生活面貌有了根本的改变。这正说明了马克思列宁主义的道路是胜利的道路。我们对兄弟般的越南人民所取得的巨大成就，感到无限的欢欣和鼓舞。
    我们在越南参观访问期间，学到了不少的东西。特别是越南人民那种勤劳勇敢、艰苦朴素的作风，是值得我们敬佩，值得我们学习的。我们现在把越南人民所取得的辉煌成就和兄弟般的友情，转达给我国工人和全体人民，以便推动我国社会主义建设。
    我们十分珍视中越两国人民亲如手足、休戚相关、安危与共的传统友谊。在社会主义建设事业和反对帝国主义侵略、保卫和平的斗争中，中国人民和兄弟的越南人民永远站在一起。中国工人阶级和全国人民坚决支持越南人民为争取祖国统一的正义斗争。美帝国主义侵略势力必须从南越滚出去，日内瓦协议必须彻底履行！
