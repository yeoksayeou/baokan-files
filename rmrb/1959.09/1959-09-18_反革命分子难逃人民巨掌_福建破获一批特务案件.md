Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 17th. Recently, the public security organs in Fujian Province, with the assistance of the people, have cracked a batch of espionage cases dispatched by the Chiang gang. Espionage elements Zhang Jinchun, Cai Shuren, Cai Caixia, Jiang Tengfei, Huang Renmin, Chen Wenhui, Chen Tianyun, Yang Dingxiang, Wu Zhaokun, Zhang Keqin, Deng Zhenfa and other eleven people have all been arrested. The public security organs seized various criminal evidences such as explosive materials, secret writing chemicals, intelligence drafts, and activity funds.

This group of espionage elements were all specially trained by the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group, and sneaked into the mainland in batches not long ago. Their sinister conspiracy was to sabotage our industrial and agricultural production and construction and coastal military facilities, railways, warehouses, etc. by means of blasting and arson; to collect our military, political, economic and other intelligence; and some even conspired to develop counter-revolutionary organizations. Espionage element Zhang Jinchun, who accepted the task of blowing up the Yingxia Railway, actively investigated destruction targets such as warehouses and bridges after sneaking back to his hometown in Yongchun County, Fujian Province, and collected gasoline, alcohol and other flammable materials everywhere, making arson equipment in an attempt to blow up the Yingxia Railway and burn down a warehouse in Chengguan. After espionage element Chen Wenhui sneaked into Xiamen City, he actively investigated the railway lines, military locations, and grain and oil warehouses in the Xiamen area, waiting for an opportunity to blow them up. After the female espionage agent Cai Caixia sneaked in, she used burning incense and worshipping Buddha as a cover to observe blasting targets and collect intelligence on our coastal military affairs and railway transportation. After espionage element Huang Renmin sneaked in, he adopted the method of luring and deceiving bad elements in an attempt to develop a espionage organization. After espionage element Yang Dingxiang sneaked back to Fuzhou, he planned to write reactionary slogans and cartoons on the walls in the suburbs and Minhou County to undermine our people's communes.

The people in the coastal areas are constantly on guard against all sabotage activities of the enemy. No matter how concealed and cunning the enemy's activities are, they cannot escape the sharp eyes of the masses. Espionage agent Chen Tianyun of the Chiang gang's "Intelligence Bureau," who attempted to sneak in by sea, was discovered by local fishermen before landing, and was captured and sent to the public security organs as soon as he landed. After espionage element Jiang Tengfei sneaked into his hometown, local cadres and the masses immediately reported and informed the public security organs of his suspicious activities. After he mixed into a middle school in Jinjiang County, his espionage acts aroused the vigilance of the teachers and students of the school, and finally exposed the hideous face of this bandit. Espionage elements Zhang Jinchun, Cai Caixia, Yang Dingxiang and others were all arrested by the public security organs with the assistance of the masses before carrying out sabotage activities.

    反革命分子难逃人民巨掌
    福建破获一批特务案件
    新华社福州17日电　福建省公安机关最近在人民群众协助下，破获了一批蒋帮派遣特务案件。特务分子张进春、蔡树仁、蔡彩霞、蒋腾飞、黄仁民、陈文辉、陈天云、杨鼎祥、吴肇坤、张克钦、邓振发等十一人全部落网，公安机关缴获了爆破器材、密写药剂、情报底稿和活动经费等各种犯罪证据。
    这一批特务分子都是经过台湾蒋介石集团专门培养训练后，在不久前分批潜入大陆的。他们的罪恶阴谋是用爆破、纵火等手段破坏我工农业生产建设和沿海军事设施、铁路、仓库等；搜集我军事、政治、经济等情报；有的还阴谋发展反革命组织。接受爆破鹰厦铁路任务的特务分子张进春，潜返原籍福建省永春县后，积极调查仓库、桥梁等破坏目标，并到处搜集汽油、酒精等易燃物品，自制纵火用具，企图爆破鹰厦铁路和烧毁城关某仓库。特务分子陈文辉潜入厦门市后，积极调查厦门一带的铁路线、军事要地和粮油等仓库情况，伺机爆破。女特务蔡彩霞潜入后，以烧香拜佛为名，四出观察爆破目标、搜集我沿海军事及铁路运输等情报。特务分子黄仁民潜入后，采取利诱欺骗的办法拉拢坏分子企图发展特务组织。特务分子杨鼎祥潜返福州后，计划在市郊和闽侯县等地墙壁上，涂写破坏我人民公社的反动标语和漫画。
    沿海地区人民时刻严防敌人的一切破坏活动，不管敌人的活动怎样隐蔽狡猾，都躲不开群众雪亮的眼睛。企图从海上偷渡潜入的蒋帮“情报局”特务陈天云，未登陆就被当地渔民发觉，一上岸就被擒住送往公安机关。特务分子蒋腾飞潜入原籍后，当地的干部和群众即接连向公安机关报告检举他的可疑活动；在他混进晋江县某中学后，他的特务行径引起了这个学校的师生的警惕，终于揭破了这个匪徒的狰狞面目。特务分子张进春、蔡彩霞、杨鼎祥等都在进行破坏活动以前就在群众协助下被公安机关逮捕了。
