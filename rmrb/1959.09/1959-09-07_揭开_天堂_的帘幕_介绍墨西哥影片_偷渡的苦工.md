    Unveiling the Curtain of “Paradise”
    —Introducing the Mexican Film “The Illicit Workers”

    The Rio Bravo flows quietly. The north bank is the United States, and the south bank is Mexico. American gold and long-term deceptive propaganda, like a beautiful poisonous snake, lure unemployed workers and poor farmers from Mexico. They risk the ruthless bullets of the American border guards, sneak across the river, seeking work and opportunities to get rich. Capistrano is one of them. However, when he arrived in the United States, he encountered discrimination and exploitation everywhere, completely different from what he had dreamed of. Vivid reality made Capistrano wake up from his dream. Finally, he resolutely returned to his motherland. – This is the story outline of the excellent Mexican film "The Illicit Workers."
    The screenwriter and director of this film, Galindo, chose such a subject matter, which has profound practical significance.
    Mexico is a country in Latin America with very abundant resources. However, the lives of the Mexican people are very poor. They have to look for a way out everywhere because most of its resources are controlled by American monopoly capital. Therefore, some people describe Mexicans as "beggars begging while sitting on golden stools." Every year, hundreds of thousands of Mexicans suffer the same fate as Capistrano. They regard the United States as a paradise of gold and happiness, fantasizing that when they arrive in the United States, they will not only be able to survive, but also get rich. They cross the border illegally to work as hired laborers on large American plantations. The large plantation owners in Texas, USA, take advantage of their illegal status of "smuggling across the border" to cruelly exploit them and buy their labor at low prices. As the Mexican writer Luis Spota said in his book "They Died in the Middle Stream": "In Texas, the word Mexican does not refer to a nationality but to an industry - the worst and most despicable of all industries." These deceived Mexicans' illusions about the United States have caused so many tragedies!
    This film uses concise artistic generalization to unveil the "paradise" curtain of this hell on earth in the gold-dollar empire, exposing its ugly essence of fattening itself by drinking human blood. At the same time, it also makes a sharp comparison between the hideous cunning of the capitalists and their agents and the kindness and loveliness of the ordinary people. Although the American contractor Stanley knew that Mexicans without documents could not find work in the United States, in order to make money from trafficking in people, he still disregarded the lives of Mexicans and encouraged Capistrano and others to smuggle into the United States to work as coolies, because this way he could buy cheap sweat at depressed wages! Capistrano, who had suffered inhumane treatment from the capitalists, lived in the friendship of Mexican compatriots and American workers who were wandering in the United States. The Mexican wanderer Villarreal guided him on how to find work, and the enthusiastic Mexican girl sheltered him and gave him noble love; at the small station, he shared weal and woe with Mexican wanderers and American workers, comforting each other.
    The reality of the United States shattered Capistrano's dream, but it also made him stronger. He resolutely returned to his motherland. It was really a narrow road for enemies. As soon as he came back, he ran into the contractor Stanley. This time, however, it was in Mexico! He and his companions angrily gave this "American" a good beating and drove him across the river! Maria, who had suffered in the United States, also returned to her motherland under Capistrano's encouragement, and linked her fate with Capistrano's; even Villarreal, who was disheartened and content to wander in the United States, returned to his motherland, determined to live with Capistrano and Maria in his own country. The film ends with a thought-provoking shot: Capistrano, Maria, and Villarreal, these three friends who share weal and woe, are moving forward on the land of their motherland... This seems to tell the audience: More and more Latin American people no longer harbor illusions about the United States, they are determined to fight against the fierce enemy, American imperialism, and build a free, independent and happy life on their own land with their own hands.

    揭开“天堂”的帘幕
    ——介绍墨西哥影片“偷渡的苦工”
    禾君
    里布拉沃河静静地流着。北岸是美国，南岸是墨西哥。美国的金元和长期的欺骗宣传，像一条美丽的毒蛇一样，引诱墨西哥的失业工人和贫苦农民。他们不惜冒着美国边防军无情的枪弹，偷渡过河去，寻找工作和发财的机会。卡普桑诺就是其中的一个。可是，当他到了美国以后，他到处遇到歧视和剥削，完全不是他所梦想的那样。活生生的现实使卡普桑诺从幻梦中醒悟过来。最后，他毅然地回到祖国来。——这就是墨西哥优秀影片“偷渡的苦工”的故事梗概。
    这部影片的编剧和导演加林多选择了这样一个题材，有着深刻的现实意义。
    墨西哥是拉丁美洲国家中资源非常丰富的国家。然而，墨西哥人民的生活却十分贫困。他们不得不到处寻找生路，因为它的大部分资源都为美国垄断资本所控制。所以，有人把墨西哥人形容是“坐着金板凳讨饭的乞丐”。每年有成千成万的墨西哥人遭到同卡普桑诺一样的命运。他们把美国看成是遍地黄金，欢乐幸福的天堂，幻想到了美国，不仅能够生活下去，而且可以发财致富。他们偷越国境到美国去当大种植园的雇工。美国得克萨斯州的大种植园主就利用他们“偷渡国境”的不合法地位，对他们进行残酷的剥削，廉价购买他们的劳动力。正如墨西哥作家路易·斯波塔在“他们死在中流”一书中所说的：“在得克萨斯州，墨西哥人一词不是指一个国籍而是指一个行业而言——这是一切行业当中最坏的最可鄙的。”这些受骗的墨西哥人对美国所抱的幻想，不知道造成了多少悲剧！
    这部影片用简练的艺术的概括，揭开了金元帝国这个人间地狱的“天堂”帘幕，暴露出它以喝人血来养肥自己的丑恶本质。同时也把资本家及其代理人的狰狞狡猾和普通人民的善良可亲作了鲜明的对比。美国包工头斯坦尼虽然知道墨西哥人没有证件是不能在美国找到工作的，但是为了要赚这一笔贩卖人口的钱，他仍然不顾墨西哥人的死活，鼓动卡普桑诺他们偷渡到美国去做苦工，因为这样又可以用压低的工资买到廉价的血汗！受过资本家非人待遇的卡普桑诺，却生活于流浪在美国的墨西哥同胞和美国工人的友情中间。墨西哥流浪者维拉累尔指点他如何寻找工作，热情的墨西哥姑娘掩护他并且给予他高贵的爱情；在小车站上，他同墨西哥流浪者和美国工人同甘共苦，互相安慰。
    美国的现实使卡普桑诺的幻梦破灭了，同时也使他变得更坚强了，他毅然地又回到了祖国来。真是冤家路窄，一回来就碰到了包工头斯坦尼。这一次可是在墨西哥呀！他和他的同伴们一起愤怒地把这个“美国佬”痛快地揍了一顿，并把他赶过河去！在美国饱受折磨的玛丽亚在卡普桑诺的鼓励下也回到了祖国，并且把自己的命运和卡普桑诺的命运连在一起；就连心灰意懒安于在美国流浪的维拉累尔也回到了祖国，决心同卡普桑诺和玛丽亚一起在自己的国家里生活。影片最后以一个令人深思的镜头结束了这个故事：卡普桑诺、玛丽亚和维拉累尔这三个同甘苦、共命运的朋友，在祖国的大地上行进……这仿佛告诉观众：越来越多的拉丁美洲人民再也不对美国存着幻想，他们决心和凶恶的敌人美帝国主义进行斗争，并且要用自己的双手在自己的土地上建立起自由、独立和幸福的生活。（附图片）
