To carry out patriotic education and revolutionary tradition education among the people, the Museum of the Revolution and the Museum of History have been completed.

(By Our Newspaper) After vigorous support from the people of the whole country and the hard work of design and construction personnel, the Chinese Revolution Museum and the Chinese History Museum, located on the east side of Tiananmen Square, have been completed. Precious cultural relics from various historical development periods of our country and various development stages of our revolution will be displayed here to conduct patriotic education and revolutionary tradition education among the people.

    The two museums are closely connected, forming a magnificent building. The highest point is nearly forty meters high, 313 meters long from north to south, and 149 meters long from east to west. The central part and the middle of the two wings are four-story buildings, and the rest are three-story buildings, with a total area of more than 65,000 square meters. The light yellow exterior walls, decorated with gold, yellow and emerald green trim on the eaves, make the outline of the entire building particularly distinct.

    A Chinese national-style colonnade with eleven arches constitutes the main entrance to the two museums. Ascending the colonnade, passing through a large courtyard and the main entrance hall, is the solemn central hall. Proceeding from the main entrance hall to the north and south wings, the Chinese Revolution Museum is to the north and the Chinese History Museum is to the south. The two museums are symmetrical and balanced in architecture, each with a prologue hall and seventeen spacious and bright exhibition halls. The exhibition area is 23,000 square meters, and the exhibition route is two kilometers long.

    The Chinese Revolution Museum and the Chinese History Museum were designed by the Beijing Planning Bureau Design Institute and constructed by the Beijing Fifth Construction Engineering Company. Design began in September last year, and construction began at the end of October. During the construction process, support was received from more than 1,500 workers from eighteen provinces and cities across the country. Factories in various places also actively undertook more than 500 processing and ordering tasks for the museum. Some employees, cadres, and students in the capital also voluntarily came to the construction site during holidays to participate in voluntary labor. The construction of these two museums also received great help from Soviet experts.

    This building is a product of the Great Leap Forward. In the process of construction, the construction workers, encouraged by the Party's general line for socialist construction, overcame various difficulties and displayed soaring energy. Many engineering projects, such as processing and installing large granite and bush-hammered stone, making artificial marble, and laying rubber floors, were all undertaken by ordinary stonemasons, carpenters, bricklayers, and plasterers who had never done these jobs before. Many engineering projects such as foundations and structures were carried out in winter and rainy seasons. Faced with these difficulties, the construction workers were full of fighting spirit, and a vigorous socialist labor competition was launched at the construction site from the very beginning. The workers put forward the bold slogan: "Work hard on sunny days, work happily on rainy days. Don't stop for light rain, fight hard in heavy rain, complete every task ahead of schedule, and welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China." The party committee secretary and general commander of the construction site and other responsible cadres went to the site to direct operations day and night. When the Yunnan Wang Hui stonemason group was installing granite, they encountered heavy rain many times. The party负责人 of the decoration department repeatedly advised them to stop and wait for the rain to stop, but no one was willing to stop. The rain became heavier and heavier, affecting the installation, so they changed to processing the granite. The ink lines on the stone were washed away by the rain, so they used red pencils that would not be washed away by the rain to replace them. In the past, the decoration stage of the project was carried out in sequence. After repeated discussions and research at the "three-in-one" meeting of construction workers, site leaders, and technicians, the construction method of using full-room scaffolding for three-dimensional cross-operation was adopted in this tall building. The workers carried out ceiling and installation on the upper layer of the scaffolding, plastered in the middle layer, and built walls and made floors below, with various operations proceeding simultaneously. With the hard work and ingenuity of the workers and the strong support from all over the country, the entire project took only ten months from groundbreaking to completion. After inspection, the project quality was good and met the design requirements.

    向人民群众进行爱国主义和革命传统教育
    革命博物馆　历史博物馆建成
    本报讯　经过全国人民的大力支援和设计施工人员的奋战，位置在天安门广场东侧的中国革命博物馆和中国历史博物馆已经建成。这里将陈列我国各个历史发展时期和我国革命各个发展阶段的珍贵文物，向人民群众进行爱国主义教育和革命传统教育。
    这两个博物馆紧连在一起，合成一座宏伟壮丽的建筑物。最高处的高度近四十米，南北长三百一十三米，东西长一百四十九米。中央部分和两翼的中部是四层建筑，其余部分是三层，总的面积为六万五千多平方米。浅黄色的外墙，屋檐上镶以金黄翠绿相间的花边，使整个建筑物的轮廓分外鲜明。
    一个富有中国民族风格的十一孔大柱廊，构成了两个博物馆总出入口。登上大柱廊，穿过一个大院和正门厅，便是庄严的中央大厅。从正门厅向南北两翼穿行，北部是中国革命博物馆，南部是中国历史博物馆，两个博物馆在建筑上是对称、平衡的，各有一个序言厅和十七个宽敞明亮的陈列厅。展览面积为二万三千平方米，展览路线长二公里。
    中国革命博物馆和中国历史博物馆，是由北京市规划局设计院负责设计，北京市第五建筑工程公司负责施工，去年9月开始设计，10月底动工兴建。在施工过程中，得到全国十八个省市一千五百多名工人的支援。各地工厂还积极承担了博物馆的五百多项加工订货任务。首都的一些职工、干部、学生在假日里也自动到工地上来参加了义务劳动。这两个博物馆的建筑还得到苏联专家很大的帮助。
    这个建筑是大跃进的产物。建筑工人们在修建过程中，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，克服了种种困难，发扬了冲天的干劲。许多工程项目如加工和安装大块花岗石和剁斧石、制作人造大理石、铺橡胶地板等等，都由从未做过这些工作的普通石工、木工、瓦工、抹灰工担任。基础、结构等许多工程项目都是在冬季和雨季进行的。建筑工人们在这些困难面前，斗志昂扬，工地上一开始就开展了热火朝天的社会主义劳动竞赛。工人提出了豪迈的口号：“晴天干得猛，雨天干得欢。小雨不停，大雨奋战，项项任务都提前，迎接建国十周年。”工地党委书记、总指挥等负责干部亲临现场，日夜指挥作战。云南王惠石工小组在安装花岗石时，屡逢暴雨。装修处党的负责人一再劝他们停一停，等雨住再干，但没有一个人肯停。雨愈下愈大，影响安装，他们就改做给花岗石加工的工作，石头上的墨汁划线被雨水冲掉，就改用雨水冲不掉的红铅笔划线来代替。装修阶段的工程，过去都是一道道工序进行的。建筑工人、工地领导和技术人员在三结合会议上经过鸣放辩论和反复研究，在这个高大建筑中，采取了支撑满堂红悬空架子，进行立体交叉作业的施工方法。工人们在架子的上层进行吊顶和安装，在中层抹灰，在下面砌墙做地面，各种作业同时并进。在工人们的苦干巧干和全国各地的大力支援下，整个工程从破土开工到竣工，只用了十个月的时间。经过验收，工程质量良好，符合设计要求。
