Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 6th: The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has made new deployments for current rural work. The Henan Provincial Committee called on the people of the province to oppose right-leaning ideas, boost their enthusiasm, fight hard in September and October, resolutely fight the drought to the end, guarantee a bumper autumn harvest, and guarantee good wheat planting.

Currently, the rural situation in Henan Province is very good. Since the release of the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Decision on Launching the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy, the people of the province have immediately responded to the call of the Party with practical actions. The movement to increase production and practice economy and the movement to fight drought and protect autumn harvests have unfolded like a surging tide throughout the province. More than one million cadres and 21 million laborers fighting on the front lines of drought resistance are all high-spirited and enthusiastic. As of August 31st, on the basis of watering 80 million mu of autumn fields once, more than 55 million mu had been watered a second time, and more than 50 million mu had been watered three, four, or five times. Combining watering with the work of inter-tillage, weeding, accumulating fertilizer, applying top dressing, and preventing insect pests, etc. in various places. Now, early autumn crops have begun to be harvested one after another, and late autumn crops are generally growing well, promising a bumper harvest. Judging from the yields of early autumn crops that have already been harvested, most of them have higher actual yields than estimated yields and exceed contracted yields, with substantial increases compared to last year. For example, the 12,878 mu of early rice harvested in Guangshan County has an average yield of 721 jin per mu, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year. The 140,000 mu of early autumn crops in Yancheng County generally increased by 20% to 30% compared to last year. According to preliminary understanding, there are already more than 4,500 mu of early rice with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu and more than 400 mu of early rice with a yield of over 2,000 jin per mu in Xinyang Prefecture. While striving for a bumper harvest of grain crops, the province also rushed to plant more than 16 million mu of autumn vegetables. The fact that such great achievements can be made this year under the conditions of severe drought is the result of the Henan Party resolutely implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the result of fully utilizing the power of water conservancy projects built since liberation, especially in 1958, and the result of fully utilizing the great superiority of the people's communes.

The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the central task of the whole Party and the whole people in the countryside is currently: to oppose right-leaning conservatism, boost enthusiasm, fight hard in September and October, resolutely fight the drought to the end, guarantee a bumper autumn harvest, and guarantee good wheat planting. In order to accomplish this task, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently put forward the following ten measures to all levels of organizations and people's communes in the province:

	1. Resolutely persist in the struggle against drought until the final victory. Under any drought conditions, it is necessary to ensure a bumper autumn harvest and ensure good wheat planting. In addition to watering three or four times to achieve high yields, it is also necessary to organize professional labor to concentrate on repairing canals and fully utilize surface water sources; irrigation areas that use water lifting should strive to expand the use of groundwater, dig ponds when ponds are dry, and find springs when wells are dry; in mountainous and hilly areas, existing ponds, weirs, and reservoirs should be repaired, mountain springs should be excavated, and water lifting stations should be established to bring water up the mountains, so as to prepare sufficient water for sowing wheat.

	2. Strengthen the late-stage management of late autumn crops and ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest in autumn. In the first half of September, a campaign to increase production of six major crops, including grain, cotton, sweet potatoes, oilseeds, tobacco, and vegetables, should be launched. For sweet potatoes, focus on watering, applying plant ash, controlling insects, and weeding, requiring each plant to increase in weight by about half a jin. Cotton should be strengthened in late-stage management, striving for each plant to produce two to three more autumn bolls, and ensure that it is picked as it opens, picked cleanly without losing any. For second-crop tobacco, add fertilizer, add water, and add management, striving to harvest more. Vegetables should be planted one mu and harvested one mu, replanting missing seedlings, weeding if there are weeds, and controlling insects if there are insects. All kinds of crops must be conscientiously "managed without stopping until the harvest is complete."

	3. Vigorously grasp the accumulation and production of fertilizer. Areas with adequate soil moisture should adhere to the principle of fertilizer taking the lead and vigorously carry out a fertilizer accumulation movement; dry areas should also have professional labor engaged in fertilizer accumulation. Immediately launch a movement to build thousands of mu of hundreds of ponds and large-scale green manure composting. Attention should also be paid to the production of soil fertilizer. It is required that wheat be generally applied with sufficient base fertilizer, and resolutely eliminate "pale-faced land."

	4. Do a good job in the autumn harvest. The early autumn harvest has begun one after another, and the late autumn harvest will also begin soon. It is necessary to fully use the experience of the summer harvest and accept the lessons of the rough autumn harvest last year to ensure careful harvesting and threshing so that every grain is stored in the granary. Also, grasp the work of selecting and retaining seeds, requiring that next year's seeds be self-sufficient in each team.

	5. Actively prepare for wheat planting. Plans should be made now, and the sowing area and tasks should be assigned to the production teams level by level, with work packages and output quotas assigned to the work groups, to ensure that the province sows 80 million mu in autumn, striving to exceed that. Currently, the five measures of "water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density" must be grasped.

	6. Develop diversified operations. Grasp the breeding and reproduction of large livestock and the storage of feed and fodder, and do a good job in autumn afforestation, seed collection, seedling cultivation, and processing of cotton, tobacco, sweet potatoes, etc.

	7. Arrange life well. The center is to run public canteens well. Vigorously carry out the reform of cooking utensils, collect a large amount of wild vegetables, and store stalks and firewood well to ensure that commune members eat their fill, eat well, and save. Also, pay attention to the commune members' hygiene, work, rest, and care for the elderly, weak, and pregnant women.

	8. Do a good job in autumn distribution and purchase work. Autumn distribution should adhere to the principle of deducting less and distributing more. The autumn grain purchase should use the experience of the summer grain purchase, following the pattern of harvesting, threshing, transporting, and storing grain immediately.

	9. Properly arrange labor and animal power. Now it is necessary to make plans for the use of labor and animal power in the "three autumns," and vigorously promote cooperation. Industrial and commercial departments should guarantee the repair and supply of various tools.

	10. Strengthen leadership and adhere to politics taking command. It is necessary to take the publicity and implementation of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party as a driving force to further boost the enthusiasm of the broad masses. Use methods that have been effective since the Great Leap Forward, such as red flag competitions, visits and comparisons, and on-site meetings, to continuously push the production upsurge forward.

    反右倾鼓干劲　大战九、十月　保证秋季丰收　保证种好小麦
    河南省委部署当前农村工作
    新华社郑州6日电　中共河南省委对当前农村工作作了新的部署。河南省委号召全省人民反对右倾、鼓足干劲、大战9、10两个月，坚决抗旱到底，保证秋季丰收，保证种好小麦。
    目前，河南省农村形势很好。自从党的八届八中全会公报和开展增产节约运动决议公布以后，全省人民立即以实际行动积极响应党的号召，增产节约运动和抗旱保丰收运动，以万马奔腾之势，在全省范围内汹涌澎湃地展开，战斗在抗旱前线上的一百多万名干部和二千一百多万名劳动大军，更是人人斗志昂扬、干劲冲天。到8月31日止，在八千万亩秋田浇过一遍的基础上，又有五千五百多万亩浇了第二遍水，浇三遍、四遍、五遍水的达五千多万亩。各地社员结合浇水，还进行了中耕除草、积肥追肥，防治虫害等工作。现在，早秋作物已经相继登场，晚秋作物普遍生长良好，丰收在望。从已经收打的早秋作物的产量看，多数是实产高于估产、超过包产，比去年增产都很大。如光山县已经收打的一万二千八百七十八亩早稻，平均亩产七百二十一斤，比去年增产四成多。郾城县十四万亩早秋作物，一般都比去年增产二成到三成，据初步了解，信阳专区亩产千斤以上的早稻已有四千五百多亩，两千斤以上的早稻四百多亩。在争取粮食作物丰收的同时，全省还抢种了一千六百多万亩秋菜。今年在严重干旱的情况下，能够取得这样大的成绩，是河南全党坚决贯彻执行党中央和毛主席指示的结果，是充分发挥解放以来特别是1958年水利建设工程威力的结果，是充分发挥人民公社巨大优越性的结果。
    中共河南省委指出，当前农村全党全民的中心任务是：反对右倾、鼓足干劲，大战9、10两个月，坚决抗旱到底，保证秋季丰收，保证种好小麦。为了完成这一任务，中共河南省委最近向全省各级组织和人民公社提出以下十项措施：
    一、坚决把抗旱斗争坚持到最后胜利，在任何干旱情况下，都必须保证秋季丰收，保证种好小麦。目前除了大浇三遍、四遍超产水外，还要组织专业劳力，突击整修渠道，充分利用地上水源；提水灌溉区要力争扩大利用地下水，塘干挖塘，井干下泉；山区、丘陵区，要整修现有塘、堰、水库，开挖山泉，建立提水站，引水上山，为播种小麦准备充足的水。
    二、加强晚秋作物后期管理，保证秋季全面大丰收。在9月前半月，要大抓粮食、棉花、红薯、油料、烟叶、蔬菜等六大作物的超产运动。红薯抓浇水、施草木灰，治虫、锄草，要求每棵增重半斤左右。棉花要加强后期管理，力争每株多结二到三个秋桃，并且做到随吐絮，随收摘，摘净不丢失。对二茬烟要加肥、加水、加管理，力争多收，蔬菜要做到种一亩收一亩，缺苗补苗，有草锄草、有虫治虫。各种作物都要切实做到“收割不完，管理不停”。
    三、大抓积肥造肥。透墒地区要坚持肥料挂帅，大搞积肥运动；干旱地区也要有专业劳力搞积肥。立即开展一个千亩百池和大沤绿肥运动。也要注意土化肥的生产。要求小麦普遍施足底肥，坚决消灭“白脸地”。
    四、搞好秋收。早秋已经陆续登场，晚秋也将开始收割，要充分运用夏收经验，接受去年秋收粗糙教训，保证细收细打、颗粒归仓。并要抓好选种留种工作，要求明年的种子做到队队自给。
    五、积极做好种麦准备工作。现在就要做规划，把播种面积、任务逐级分配到生产队，包工包产落实到作业组，保证全省秋播八千万亩，力争超过。目前要抓好“水、肥、土、种、密”五项措施。
    六、开展多种经营。抓好大家畜配种、繁殖和饲草饲料的储备，并做好秋季造林、采种、育苗和棉花、烟叶、红薯等的加工工作。
    七、安排好生活。中心是办好公共食堂，要大力进行炊具改革，大量采集野菜，收存好秸秆、柴草，保证社员吃饱吃好吃省。并且要注意社员的卫生、劳动、休息和照顾老、弱、孕妇。
    做好秋季分配和征购工作。秋季分配要坚持少扣多分的原则。秋粮征购要运用夏粮征购的经验，随收随打随运随入仓。
    九、妥善安排劳、畜力。现在就要作出三秋中使用劳力和畜力的规划，大力提倡协作。工、商业部门要保证各种工具的修配和供应。
    十、加强领导，坚持政治挂帅。要以宣传和贯彻党的八届八中全会公报和决议为动力，进一步鼓足广大群众的干劲。运用在大跃进以来行之有效的红旗竞赛，参观评比和现场会议等方法，把生产高潮不断地推向前进。
