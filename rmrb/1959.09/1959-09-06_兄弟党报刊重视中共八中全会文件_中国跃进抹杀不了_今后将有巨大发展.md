Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The communiqués and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee have become a subject of attention for the newspapers and periodicals of communist parties in several countries recently.

The "Akahata" (Red Flag), the central committee organ of the Japanese Communist Party, devoted half a page on its second page on August 28 to publish news about the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee. This news included three parts: the first part was the main points of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee, with the title: "Continue the Great Leap Forward. Complete the Main Targets of the Second Five-Year Plan Within This Year"; the second part was a summary of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee on launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy, with the title: "People's Communes Embark on a Sound Path"; the third part was a communiqué on the revision of agricultural statistics for 1958, released by the State Statistical Bureau of China on the 26th.

On the 29th, "Akahata" continued to publish news on its second page regarding the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee, with the title "The Significance of the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee. Criticizing Right-Leaning Thought. Emphasizing the Completion of the Second Five-Year Plan Within This Year." The newspaper also published a summary of the "People's Daily" editorial on the 27th, "Oppose Right-Leaning Tendencies, Go All Out, and Strive to Complete the Main Targets of the Second Five-Year Plan This Year." The title added by "Akahata" was: "People's Daily Issues Call: Greet the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation With a Great Increase in Production."

On the 31st, "Akahata" published news on its second page about the meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China and a summary of the report made by Premier Zhou Enlai at the meeting, with the title: "The Situation of Continuing the Leap Forward. Premier Zhou Criticizes the Pessimistic Arguments of Some People." On the same page, there was also a summary of the talks by the heads of various democratic parties in China in support of the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, with the title: "Representatives of Various Democratic Parties in China Issue Statements in Support of the Declaration of the Eighth Plenary Session."

The Belgian Communist Party's newspaper "Le Drapeau Rouge" (Red Flag) published news about the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee on August 28 under the title "Industrial Production Increased by 65% in One Year."

The British Communist Party's publication "World News" weekly published the full text of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee in its latest issue.

The Lebanese Communist Party's newspaper "Al Nida" (The Call) published the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee on August 27. The Lebanese Communist Party's "News Weekly" published detailed news about the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee and the meeting's communiqué and resolutions on its front page on August 30. Its title was: "Important Resolutions Passed by the Eighth Meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The resolutions indicate that there will be a great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and indicate that huge development is expected in the next few years."

The Austrian Communist Party's newspaper "Volksstimme" (People's Voice) published an article on August 28 which pointed out that it is impossible for anti-communist newspapers to casually erase China's Great Leap Forward.

The article commented on the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee, with the title: "China's 1962 Targets Can Be Reached This Year." The subtitle was: "A Second Great Leap Forward, False Reports of Anti-Communist Newspapers Go Bankrupt."

The article said that the main targets of China's Second Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) can be reached this year, that is, within two years. This is the result of the Great Leap Forward, the high-speed development of China's national economy. In this way, it may take only ten years instead of fifteen years to surpass Britain in the production of important industrial products.

The article said that in the production of steel, raw coal, timber, metal-cutting machine tools, cotton yarn, machine-made paper, crude salt, grain, and cotton, the 1962 targets can be reached this year. It can be seen that 1959 will mean a continued leap forward for China's national economy.

The article concluded by saying that the anti-communist newspapers clamored that China's plan "failed," that the planned targets were revised, and even cut in half, and that these hysterical reports have gone bankrupt. The Great Leap Forward cannot be casually erased by anti-communist newspapers.

    兄弟党报刊重视中共八中全会文件
    中国跃进抹杀不了　今后将有巨大发展
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：中共八届八中全会的公报和决议是一些国家的共产党的报刊近日来注意的主题。
    日本共产党中央委员会机关报“赤旗报”8月28日在第二版以半版地位刊登了关于中共八中全会的消息。这条消息包括三个部分：第一部分是中共八中全会公报的要点，标题是：“继续大跃进。在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标”；第二部分是中共八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议的摘要，标题是：“人民公社走上健全的道路”；第三部分是关于中国国家统计局26日发表的关于修正1958年农业统计数字的公报。
    29日的“赤旗报”在第二版继续刊登了一篇有关中共八中全会的消息，标题是“中国共产党八中全会的意义。批判右倾思想。强调在今年内完成第二个五年计划”。这家报纸同一天还摘要刊登了人民日报27日的社论“反右倾，鼓干劲，为在今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而斗争”。“赤旗报”所加的标题是：“人民日报发出号召：在大增产中迎接建国十周年”。
    31日的“赤旗报”在第二版刊登了关于中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会全体会议的消息和周恩来总理在会议上所作的报告的摘要，标题是：“继续跃进的局面。周总理批判一部分人的悲观论调”。同版还刊登了中国各民主党派负责人关于支持中共八中全会的公报和决议的谈话摘要，标题是：“中国各民主党派代表发表谈话，支持八中全会的声明”。
    比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”8月28日以“工业生产量在一年内增长65％”为标题，刊载了关于中共八中全会决议的消息。
    英国共产党刊物“世界新闻”周刊，在最近一期中全文刊载了中共八届八中全会的公报。
   黎巴嫩共产党机关报“呼声报”在8月27日刊载了中共八中全会的公报和决议。黎巴嫩共产党的“消息周报”8月30日在第一版详细刊载了有关中共八中全会的消息以及会议的公报和决议。它的标题是：“中国共产党中央委员会第八次会议所通过的重要决议。决议表明工农业方面将有大跃进，并且表明今后几年预料将有巨大发展。”
    奥地利共产党机关报“人民之声报”8月28日刊载一篇文章指出：反共的报纸是不可能随便抹杀掉中国的大跃进的。
    这篇文章评述了中共八届八中全会的公报和决议，它的标题是：“中国1962年的指标今年就可以达到”。副题是：“第二次大跃进，反共报纸的错误报道破产。”
    文章说，中国第二个五年计划 （1958—1962年）的主要指标在今年，也就是两年内就可以达到。这是大跃进，中国国民经济高速度发展的结果。这样，就不需要十五年，而只要十年就可能在重要的工业品生产方面超过英国。
    文章说，在钢、原煤、原木、金属切削机床、棉纱、机制纸、原盐、粮食、棉花的生产方面，今年就可以达到1962年指标。可见1959年对中国国民经济来说，将意味着继续的跃进。
    文章最后说，反共的报纸叫嚣中国的计划“失败了”，计划指标修正了，甚至削减了一半，这些歇斯底里的报道都破产了。大跃进是不能为反共的报纸随便抹杀得掉的。
