Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: The First National Games, held to review the great achievements of China's sports over the past decade, victoriously concluded all its competition events on September 27th. This National Games opened well and splendidly. With its grand scale and "large-scale harvest," the Games left a deep and unforgettable impression on the people of the whole country. It was a Games that combined popularization and improvement, where athletes, referees, coaches, and staff from all regions and ethnic groups united in friendship, improved together, and achieved a double harvest in politics and technology. It will have an inestimable impact on the broader development of mass sports activities and the further improvement of sports technical levels in our country.

A total of more than 10,600 male and female athletes from more than 20 ethnic groups participated in the Games, competing in 36 competition events and six demonstration events covering water, land, and air. The entire Games attracted over one million spectators. In the competitions and demonstrations, seven athletes broke four world records four times, and 664 athletes broke 106 national records and national new achievements 844 times. It is unprecedented to have so many people breaking so many national records so many times in a single Games.

Whether in record-based events or in events characterized by winning and losing, the Games presented a complex, ever-changing, and subtle situation. Examples of newcomers defeating veterans and "weak" teams winning against strong teams emerged one after another, presenting a new atmosphere of vigorous development in which everyone was chasing after each other and striving for the top.

The general improvement of performance and technical level is one of the most prominent features of this Games. This feature is reflected in the sports events themselves and in the widespread improvement of athletes' performances in various regions. In track and field, swimming, weightlifting, and national defense sports such as airplane parachute jumping, shooting, radio transmission and reception, and nautical models, where national records exist, good news of breaking national records was reported almost every day. Furthermore, four events – men's 100-meter breaststroke, women's daytime collective precision parachute jumping, women's small-bore rifle 50 and 100-meter 30-shot prone, and radio-controlled piston engine model airplane altitude – broke world records.

Not only was the number of improved events large, but many events also saw a large number of equally skilled and very close contestants emerge. For example, the top eight finishers in the men's 100-meter butterfly were all within the Master of Sports standard (one minute and eight seconds); the top eight finishers in the men's pole vault all cleared the Master of Sports standard height (four meters and ten centimeters); all twenty national records in men's and women's archery were broken, with a total of fifty-six people breaking them. Even more people broke all eight national records in men's and women's rowing, reaching a total of 298.

It was not only units with a good foundation that achieved excellent results; units with a weaker foundation also began to "pass the imperial examination." For example, the little-known Anhui acrobatics team won the first place in the team total score of the acrobatics competition. The Shaanxi football team, composed of second- and third-level athletes and athletes without any ranking titles, won sixth place in the football final. The champions of the forty-two men's and women's track and field events were won by athletes from seventeen units – including provinces such as Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan, which had lower track and field levels in the past. All of these demonstrate the increasing improvement of athletes' performances in various regions and the narrowing of the gap between them.

In the eleven ball games of the National Games, many unpredictable situations occurred. It was often difficult to estimate in advance who would win the championships in many events. In men's football, basketball, and volleyball, no team was able to maintain an undefeated record in the finals. Thirteen football finals ended in draws, and in fourteen men's basketball finals, the scores of the two sides differed by less than five points. The championship battle in polo ended in a five-to-five tie between the Inner Mongolia team and the People's Liberation Army team. In other events such as chess and wrestling, the competitions were also fiercely contested and difficult to separate. In short, situations where "absolute advantage" was achieved greatly reduced.

The emergence of a large number of talented newcomers with the brave attitude of "a newborn calf is not afraid of tigers" into the ranks of outstanding athletes in our country is also one of the characteristics of this Games. These young newcomers are full of enthusiasm and making rapid progress, competing with the veterans in the competition. Some have frequently won victories, earning widespread praise for "the younger generation being formidable." Zhou Xiyang, a fourteen-year-old Young Pioneer from Beijing who could not swim a year ago, defeated Liang Xiuying, a five-time national champion, and won the women's springboard diving championship. Li Furong, a seventeen-year-old table tennis player from Shanghai, defeated Rong Guotuan, the world singles champion, in the men's singles competition. Zhang Changjia, a twenty-year-old track and field athlete from Hunan, won the gold medal by beating Chen Zhengxiu, the national record holder in the women's 800 meters. The Jiangxi men's volleyball team, the Guangdong and Heilongjiang men's basketball teams, and the Guizhou and Yunnan women's basketball teams, which were previously unknown, have respectively defeated some of the strongest teams in the country – the People's Liberation Army, the Guangdong men's volleyball team, the Beijing men's basketball team, and the Hebei women's basketball team. The emergence of these newcomers has refreshed the face of sports in our country.

The selection of athletes for this Games was extremely broad, including people from all walks of life, including workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers. They are experts in their production, work, and study positions, and champions on the sports field. The Shanghai cycling team, composed entirely of worker athletes, won the championship in the men's 100-kilometer road cycling team event. Chong Xiuyun, a rural girl from Jiangsu, was invincible in the shot put competition. Ethnic minority athletes also achieved good results in the competition. Serik, a 24-year-old production team leader from a people's commune in Xinjiang's Kazakh ethnic group, won the international freestyle wrestling heavyweight championship. Zaxi Wenmao, a seventeen-year-old Tibetan girl from Qinghai, ranked third in the women's hand grenade throwing competition. These fully demonstrate the extent of the widespread development of mass sports activities in our country.

Exemplary adherence to sportsmanship, unity and friendship, mutual learning, and mutual improvement are another feature of this Games. On the competition field and in the athletes' dormitories, athletes from all units and ethnic groups learned from each other, taught each other, and helped each other. In all competition venues, athletes were able to consciously abide by discipline and respect referees. Athletes, referees, and Games staff also greatly improved in terms of their political and ideological style during this Games.

This large-scale Games also trained a large number of sports work cadres. The Games staff, referees, and coaches from various units all gained valuable on-site experience through this Games. People learned how to organize such a large-scale Games. Through practice, referees further improved the quality of their refereeing work, and coaches enriched their coaching skills. The rich gains they have made will help to further improve the level of sports in our country in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: On the morning of the 27th, one world record and two national records were broken in the aviation model record test flight of the National Games.

Zhao Jiazhen and Wang Yongxi of the People's Liberation Army flew a radio-controlled piston engine model airplane to a height of 1,260 meters, breaking the world record of 1,142 meters for radio-controlled piston engine model airplane altitude set by Belgian athlete E. P. Gaubert in August 1955. Zhao Jiazhen and Wang Yongxi's model airplane flew for twenty-six minutes and thirty-four seconds in this flight, of which the engine working time was six minutes, and the landing point was 323.3 meters away from the take-off point (not allowed to exceed 500 meters according to regulations).

Chen Shouxiang (Shaanxi), Hu Jianye (People's Liberation Army), and Wang Chengzeng (Jiangsu) broke the national record of 171.4 kilometers per hour for the circular speed of the Level 2 line-controlled speed model airplane, which was created by Chen Shouxiang in May this year, with speeds of 209.3 kilometers per hour, 201.1 kilometers per hour, and 178.2 kilometers per hour, respectively. Among them, Chen Shouxiang's performance also exceeded the latest national record of 204.5 kilometers per hour created by Beijing team player Chen Zhaohe in the competition of this National Games on September 17.

Yuan Rongkai, an athlete from the People's Liberation Army, also created the national highest performance in this event with a speed of 180 kilometers per hour for the Level 3 line-controlled speed model airplane. (Picture attached)

    竞赛活动全部结束　赢得“大面积丰收”
    全运会开得好开得精彩
    航空模型纪录测验飞行打破一项世界纪录
    据新华社27日讯　为检阅我国体育运动十年来伟大成就而举行的第一届全国运动会，已经在9月27日胜利地结束了它的全部竞赛活动。这次运动会开得好，开得精彩，运动会以它盛大的规模和“大面积的丰收”，给全国人民留下了深刻的、难忘的印象。这是一次普及和提高相结合，各地各民族运动员、裁判员、教练员、工作人员团结友爱、共同提高，获得政治、技术双丰收的运动会。它对我国群众性体育活动更广泛的开展和运动技术水平进一步的提高，将产生难以估量的影响。
    参加这次运动会的共有一万零六百多名包括二十多个民族的男女运动员，他们参加了包括水、陆、空三个方面的三十六个竞赛项目和六个表演赛项目的比赛。整个运动会的观众达百万人次以上。在竞赛和表演中，共有七名运动员四次打破了四项世界纪录，有六六四名运动员八四四次打破了一零六项全国纪录和全国新成绩。在一次运动会上有这么多人这么多次打破这么多项全国纪录，是史无前例的。
    这次运动会不论是在有纪录的项目方面，还是在以胜负为特征的项目方面，都出现了错综复杂、瞬息万变的微妙局面。新手战胜老将、“弱”队赢了强队的事例，层出不穷，使整个运动会呈现了你追我赶、力争上游的蓬勃发展的新气象。
    成绩和技术水平有了普遍提高，是这次运动会最突出的特点之一。这一特点表现在运动项目本身，也表现在各地选手成绩提高的广泛性方面。在有全国纪录的田径、游泳、举重和飞机跳伞、射击、无线电收发报、航海模型等国防体育项目中，几乎每天都传出了打破全国纪录的捷报，并且有四项——男子一百米蛙泳、女子日间集体定点跳伞、女子小口径步枪五十和一百米各三十发卧射、无线电操纵活塞式发动机模型飞机飞行高度——打破了世界纪录。
    成绩提高的项目不仅数目众多，而且许多项目中都涌现出了成批水平相当高而又彼此十分接近的选手。例如男子百米蝶泳前八名的成绩都在运动健将标准（一分八秒）以内；男子撑竿跳高前八名都跳过了运动健将标准的高度（四米十）；男女射箭全部二十项全国最高成绩已全被打破，打破的共有五十六人。打破男女赛艇全部八项全国最高成绩的人更多，共达二百九十八人。
    成绩优异的不仅仅是原来基础较好的单位，原来基础较差的单位也已开始“金榜题名”。例如不大知名的安徽技巧队，获得了技巧比赛的团体总分第一名。由二、三级运动员和尚无等级运动员称号的选手组成的陕西足球队，获得了足球决赛的第六名。男女田径四十二个项目的冠军，是由十七个单位——其中包括了过去田径运动水平较低的黑龙江、山西、湖南、湖北、河南等省的选手夺得的。这些都说明了各地选手成绩日益提高，相差的距离日益缩小。
    在全运会的十一项球类比赛中，更出现了许多难以预料的情况。许多项目冠军属谁，往往事先很难估计。男子足球、篮球、排球，没有一个队能在决赛中保持不败的纪录。足球决赛有十三场踢成平局，男子篮球决赛有十四场双方得分相差不到五分。马球的冠军争夺战，是以内蒙古队同解放军队打成五比五不分胜负的平局而结束的。其他如棋类、摔跤等项目中，也都出现了竞赛得难解难分的局面。总之，以“绝对优势”获胜的情况，已大大地减少了。
    大批有才能的新手以“初生之犊不怕虎”的英勇姿态，跃入了我国优秀运动员的行列，也是这次运动会的特点之一。这些年轻的新手干劲十足，进步飞快，同老手们在竞赛中竞相争辉。有的频频得胜，赢得了一片“后生可畏”的赞扬声。一年前还不会游泳的北京十四岁的少先队员周希洋，竟战胜了五届全国冠军获得者梁秀英，荣获了女子跳板跳水冠军。上海十七岁的乒乓球选手李富荣，在男子单打比赛中打败了世界单打冠军容国团。湖南二十岁的田径选手张畅加，赢了女子八百米全国纪录保持者陈正绣，得到了金质奖章。几个月以前还是默默无闻的江西男子排球队，广东、黑龙江男子篮球队，贵州、云南女子篮球队，曾经分别击败了全国最强的一些劲旅——解放军、广东男子排球队、北京男子篮球队和河北女子篮球队。这些新手的出现，使我国体育运动面貌一新。
    这次运动会的选手代表性极为广泛，工农商学兵各行各业的人物都有。他们在生产、工作、学习岗位上是好手，在运动场上是健将。全部由工人选手组成的上海自行车队，获得了男子一百公里公路自行车团体赛的冠军。江苏农村姑娘崇秀云，在铅球比赛中所向无敌。少数民族选手也在竞赛中取得了良好的成绩。新疆哈萨克族二十四岁的人民公社生产大队长赛里克，荣获了国际自由式摔跤重量级冠军。青海十七岁的藏族姑娘扎西文毛，在女子手榴弹掷远比赛中名列第三。这些充分地体现出了我国群众性体育活动广泛开展的程度。
    模范地遵守体育道德，团结友爱，互相学习，互相提高是这次运动的又一个特点。在竞赛场上、在运动员宿舍里，各单位、各民族选手你学我教，互相帮助。在各竞赛场地上，运动员都能自觉地遵守纪律，尊重裁判。运动员、裁判员和大会工作人员在这次运动会中，在政治和思想作风方面，也得到很大的提高。
    这次规模巨大的运动会，也锻炼了一大批体育工作干部，大会的工作人员、裁判员和各单位的教练员，通过这次运动会，都取得了许多宝贵的现场经验。人们学会了如何组织这样大规模的运动会，裁判人员通过实践，进一步提高了裁判工作的质量，教练员丰富了自己的指导艺术。他们取得的这些丰硕的收获，将有助于今后进一步提高我国体育运动的水平。
    新华社27日讯　27日上午，全国运动会航空模型纪录测验飞行中打破了一项世界纪录，两项全国纪录。
    解放军队的赵嘉桢、王永熙的一架无线电操纵活塞式发动机模型飞机飞行高度一千二百六十米，打破了比利时运动员伊·普·高保在1955年8月创造的无线电操纵活塞式发动机模型飞机高度一千一百四十二米的世界纪录。赵嘉桢、王永熙的模型飞机在这次飞行中飞行了二十六分三十四秒，其中发动机工作时间为六分钟，着陆点与起飞点相距三百二十三点三米（按规定不得超过五百米）。
    陈寿祥（陕西）、胡建业（解放军）、王承增（江苏）三人，分别以每小时二零九点三公里、二零一点一公里和一七八点二公里的成绩，打破了陈寿祥今年5月创造的二级线操纵竞速模型飞机的圆周速度每小时一七一点四公里的全国纪录。其中，陈寿祥的成绩还超过了北京队选手陈肇和9月17日在本届全国运动会竞赛中创造的每小时二零四点五公里的全国最新成绩。
    解放军运动员袁荣楷还以三级线操纵竞速模型飞机每小时一百八十公里的速度，创造了这个项目的全国最高成绩。（附图片）
