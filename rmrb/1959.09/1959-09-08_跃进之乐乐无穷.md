People's joys, angers, sorrows, and pleasures are always caused by something. If it were not for a mental disorder, one would never laugh or cry for no reason. As the saying goes, "A joyful event brings a refreshing spirit." The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are the greatest joyful events for the 600 million people. Under the shining light of the Party's General Line for building socialism, they are creating unprecedented miracles with their own hands and wisdom. They watch as steel, coal, grain, cotton, and other material wealth grow at a high speed that is beyond the reach of capitalist societies. They watch as all difficulties and obstacles give way and retreat. They watch as the poor and blank face of the motherland rapidly changes. They watch as the wonderful ideals for which so many revolutionary martyrs sacrificed and struggled are about to be realized. What could be greater joy in the world than this? The ancients said, "The joy of reading is boundless," but for us, it is "The joy of the Great Leap Forward is boundless."

Here, we have universal cheers, nationwide celebrations, the east wind prevails, and the atmosphere is hot and bustling. This is truly "cold water on the head and ice in the arms" for our enemies at home and abroad. We leap forward, they curse; we are happy, they are sad. This is inevitable. If anyone were to imagine that the imperialists would change their attitude of hostility towards our cause, that would be as foolish as wanting a bedbug to become a bee, or a bat to love the sun. The only way to deal with the enemy's barking is to give them a resolute counterattack, or to show them the utmost contempt. This need not be said. However, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists in the revolutionary ranks also sing a different tune in the face of the vigorous Great Leap Forward. Amidst the universal praise and cheers, they feel sorrow from the bottom of their hearts and weep in a corner. What else are these people but agents of the bourgeoisie? Look, facing the nationwide, all-people leap forward like ten thousand horses galloping, they are sad and disappointed; facing the rising sun, they are dazed and confused. This surging and roaring tide of the Great Leap Forward still cannot ignite any warmth in their stiff and cold souls. This is truly a great sorrow for the right-leaning opportunists. "There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart." If the right-leaning opportunists do not wake up and join the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, advancing together with the people, then they will never have a happy day, because the people will leap forward forever, and always sing loudly in the Great Leap Forward!

    跃进之乐乐无穷
    萧丕安
    人们的喜怒哀乐，总是有所为而发，如果不是神经失常，是绝不会无缘无故地发笑和流泪的。正如俗语说的“人逢喜事精神爽”。总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是六亿人民的最大喜事，人们在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，和用自己的双手和智慧创造着亘古未有的奇迹，眼看着钢、煤、粮、棉其他物资财富以资本主义社会所望尘莫及的高速度增长；眼看着一切困难和阻碍纷纷让路后退；眼看着祖国一穷二白的面貌正在迅速地起变化；眼看着那多少革命先烈为之牺牲奋斗的美妙理想行将实现。世界上还有什么比这更大的快乐呢？古人说：“读书之乐乐无穷”，我们是“跃进之乐乐无穷”。
    我们这里是万众欢呼，普天同庆，东风浩荡，热气腾腾。这对我们的国内外敌人可真是“凉水浇头怀抱冰”。我们跃进，他们咒骂，我们高兴，他们悲哀，这是必然的，如果有什么人设想要帝国主义者改变敌视我们的事业的态度，那可真像要臭虫变蜜蜂，要蝙蝠爱太阳一样愚蠢。对待敌人的狂吠，只能给以坚决的反击，要不就投以最大的轻蔑，这是不必多说的。可是在革命队伍中的一小撮右倾机会主义分子，在轰轰烈烈的大跃进面前却也唱起反调来了，在四海讴歌，万众欢腾声中，他们却悲从中来，向隅而泣了。这不是资产阶级的代理人又是什么呢？你看面对着全国全民这样万马奔腾般地跃进，他悲伤失意；面对着初升的朝阳，他恍惚迷离。这汹涌澎湃的滚滚跃进热潮，尚且不能使他那僵冷的灵魂发出热劲，这对右倾机会主义分子来说可真是个大悲哀。“哀莫大于心死”，右倾机会主义者如果不憣然省悟，投入跃进的行列，同人民一道前进，那他将永远不会有快乐的一日，因为人民将永不停息的跃进，永远在跃进中高声歌唱！
