Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 21st: The National Construction and Installation Experience Exchange Conference recently held in Lanzhou called on more than one million construction and installation workers across the country to exert full effort, continue fighting for a hundred days, and, while ensuring project quality, exceed this year's construction and installation tasks by 10%.

The conference analyzed the current situation of the construction industry nationwide. From January to August this year, the national construction industry had completed 63% of the annual construction and installation plan, 22% more work than in the same period last year, and the quality of most projects reached excellent standards; the average cost in the first half of the year was reduced by 13.3% compared with the plan. Especially after August, in response to the Party's call, employees launched a new upsurge of the production increase and economy practice movement by opposing Right deviationist thought and stirring up zeal, and the amount of work completed in August increased by 20% compared with July. The conference believes that the current situation in the construction industry is very good, with the vast number of employees full of enthusiasm, construction projects have been fully arranged, the material supply situation has also improved, and there is a good working foundation for the first eight months of this year. As long as we continue to oppose Right deviationist thought, stir up zeal, and fully promote the experience of the Great Leap Forward, and vigorously carry out the production increase and economy practice movement, we can not only overfulfill this year's construction and installation plan, but also greatly promote various tasks of the construction industry.

The conference further summarized and affirmed the experiences of vigorously promoting rapid construction, vigorously promoting technological revolution, vigorously promoting diversified operations, vigorously promoting mass movements, and vigorously promoting communist cooperation since the Great Leap Forward in the construction industry. The conference pointed out that these experiences are the fundamental measures for the construction industry to implement the general line and realize the Great Leap Forward, and must continue to be promoted.

Since the beginning of this year, rapid construction has been newly developed, and successful experiences have been gained in organizing rapid construction of large-scale industrial buildings and tall civil buildings in large areas. For example, the construction of the China Revolution Museum and the China History Museum, the new Beijing Railway Station, the Workers' Stadium, and the National Cultural Palace in Beijing, as well as ten key projects such as the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant and the Cement Plant, were all built using rapid construction methods, which were not only fast but also of good quality. The conference required all localities to adopt rapid construction as a common and regular construction method, organize projects in order, carry out campaigns in stages and batches, and seize the end-of-project work to strive for early completion and delivery to production or use.

The conference required all localities to promote the "one-dragon" experience in machinery innovation created in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, that is, to standardize existing new machinery and organize complete sets according to different types of work and procedures for promotion, so that mechanization, semi-mechanization, and improved tooling are combined to gradually improve the level of mechanization.

The conference also required all construction and installation enterprises to take various measures to tap the potential of materials, and at the same time, to produce some materials and machinery through self-reliance, and strive to complete 100% of the tasks with 70% to 80% of the materials allocated by the state.

In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the conference called on construction and installation workers to further carry out the competition of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and comparing speed, quality, efficiency, economy, and safety, and to strengthen the great cooperation between Party A and Party B and other parties.

The conference commended advanced units that emerged during the Great Leap Forward. The Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, Nantong City Construction Engineering Company, the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the First Division of the Construction Engineering Corps of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, the Dalian City First Construction Engineering Company, the Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Worker Youth Shock Team, and the Baotou City Third Construction Engineering Company were all rewarded at the meeting.

The conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the National Committee of the Construction Trade Union, and was attended by more than 500 representatives from the construction system of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. (Attached picture)

    全国建筑安装会议提出年底以前奋战目标
    超额10％完成建筑安装任务
    办法是：反右倾、鼓干劲，大搞群众运动、快速施工、技术革命、多种经营、共产主义协作
    新华社兰州21日电　最近在兰州举行的全国建筑安装经验交流会议，号召全国一百多万建筑安装工人鼓足干劲，继续大战一百天，在确保工程质量的前提下，超额10％完成今年的建筑安装任务。
    会议分析了全国建筑业当前的形势。今年1月至8月，全国建筑业已经完成全年建筑安装计划63％，比去年同期完成的工作量多22％，绝大部分工程质量达到优良标准；上半年成本平均比计划降低13.3％。特别是8月份以后，职工们响应党的号召，反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起了增产节约运动新高潮，8月份完成的工作量又比7月份提高20％。会议认为，目前建筑业形势很好，广大职工干劲冲天，建设项目已有全面安排，材料供应情况也有好转，并且有了今年前八个月良好的工作基础，只要继续反右倾，鼓干劲，充分发扬大跃进的经验，大搞增产节约运动，不但可以超额完成今年建筑安装计划，并且能够大大推进建筑业的各项工作。
    会议进一步总结和肯定了建筑业大跃进以来大搞快速施工、大搞技术革命、大搞多种经营、大搞群众运动、大搞共产主义协作的经验。会议指出，这些经验是建筑业贯彻总路线和实现大跃进的根本措施，必须继续推广。
    今年以来，快速施工有了新的发展，在组织大面积的大型工业建筑和高大民用建筑的快速施工方面，取得了成功的经验。如北京的中国革命博物馆和中国历史博物馆、北京新车站、工人体育场、民族文化宫等建筑，上海的上钢一厂、水泥厂等十个重点工程，都是采取快速施工的方法建成的，不仅速度快，质量也好。会议要求各地把快速施工作为普遍经常采用的施工方法，将各项工程排队，分期分批组织战役，抓紧收尾工程，力争提早竣工交付生产或使用。
    会议要求各地推广北京、上海、天津等地创造的机具革新方面的“一条龙”经验，即把已有新机具经过定型，按不同工种工序组织成套一同推广，使机械化、半机械化、改良工具化结合起来，逐步提高机械化的水平。
    会议还要求各建筑安装企业采取各种措施挖掘材料潜力，同时自力更生地生产一部分材料和机械，力争用国家拨给的70％到80％的材料，完成百分之百的任务。
    为了保证上述各项任务的完成，会议号召建筑安装职工进一步开展学先进、赶先进和比速度、比质量、比效率、比节约、比安全的竞赛，并且加强甲乙方和其它各方面的大协作。
    这次会议评选了大跃进中涌现的先进单位。北京市建筑工程局、南通市建筑工程公司、建筑工程部第一工程局、新疆生产建设兵团建筑工程第一师、旅大市第一建筑工程公司、张百发钢筋工青年突击队、包头市第三建筑工程公司等单位，都在会上受到奖励。
    这次会议是由建筑工程部和建筑工会全国委员会联合召开的，参加的有各省市自治区建筑系统代表五百多人。（附图片）
