Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, September 13th: The Thai Government Public Relations Department, in a statement issued on the 11th, openly threatened that Thailand could not "stand idly by" regarding the Laotian situation and that it was prepared to participate in any force that "defended" the Kingdom of Laos.

The statement incited the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to directly intervene in Laos with armed forces. In order to create a pretext for realizing the U.S.-instigated conspiracy to further interfere in Laos, the statement vigorously promoted that "the Laotian situation has now exceeded the point where democratic countries can calmly observe without providing any moral or material support." The statement also "expressed regret" at the attitude of some countries, because these countries believed that "helping Laos is like adding fuel to the fire."

On the same day, Thai Interior Minister Charoon Sukasem also told reporters, advocating that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "should at least send observers to Laos to understand the current actual situation and what assistance can be given," in order to pave the way for this aggressive bloc to carry out armed intervention in Laos. Thai radio also clamored that this aggressive bloc should play a "role" in interfering in Laotian affairs.

The Thai government officials issued these blatant threats to interfere in Laos after the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization held another meeting on the Laotian situation. The communiqué issued after the meeting on the 11th expressed support for the United Nations Security Council's illegal resolution to establish a subcommittee to investigate the Laotian situation. The communiqué also stated that the current situation in Laos "threatens the sovereignty, integrity, and political independence of one of the countries to which the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty applies." This aggressive bloc is "anxiously awaiting the observation team to go to Laos and its investigation report."

The above situation shows that this aggressive bloc is waiting for the completion of the steps of creating a "basis" for intervention in Laos, which is presided over by the United States, and then seizing the opportunity to directly interfere in the Laotian situation. In this dirty conspiracy planned by the United States, Thailand is playing a dangerous role of actively fueling the flames and helping to drag other countries into the water.

Prior to this, just as the United States was stepping up its planning for armed intervention in the Laotian situation, Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat and Deputy Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn both clamored on the 10th that they would interfere in Laos. Thanom declared that when the Phoui Sananikone government requested Thailand through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Thailand would send troops to Laos.

On the same day, Sarit also announced that Thailand would soon send a military delegation including representatives from the army, navy, and air force to Laos, and that this delegation would also go to the combat areas near the Laotian civil war as much as possible.

Observers here pointed out that judging from the above activities of the Thai government, it has brazenly embarked on the dangerous path of following the United States in undermining peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. Such actions by the Thai authorities will only bring unfavorable consequences for themselves.

### 悍然追随美国破坏东南亚和平  泰国积极插手干涉老挝  官方公然宣称要派兵到老挝去

    悍然追随美国破坏东南亚和平
    泰国积极插手干涉老挝
    官方公然宣称要派兵到老挝去
    据新华社13日讯　曼谷消息：泰国政府民众联络厅在11日发表的一项声明中公然威胁说，泰国不能对老挝局势“袖手旁观”，它准备参加任何“保卫”老挝王国的部队。
    声明鼓动由东南亚条约组织出头对老挝进行直接的武装干涉。为了替实现美国策动的进一步干涉老挝的阴谋制造借口，声明极力宣扬“老挝局势现在已经超过了民主国家可以平静观望而不给予任何道义或物资的支持的地步”。声明同时对一些国家的态度“表示遗憾”，因为这些国家认为“帮助老挝等于火上加油”。
    同一天，泰国内政部长乍鲁沙天向记者发表谈话时，也鼓动东南亚条约组织“至少应该派遣观察员到老挝去了解一下目前的实际情况和可以给予什么援助”，以便为这个侵略集团对老挝进行武装干涉铺平道路；泰国电台也叫嚷这个侵略集团应该在干涉老挝的行动方面发挥“作用”。
    泰国官方是在东南亚条约组织再次就老挝局势举行会议以后，发出这些干涉老挝的露骨威胁的。这个侵略集团在11日举行会议后发表的公报表示支持联合国安全理事会作出的关于成立调查老挝局势的小组委员会的非法决议。公报还说，目前老挝的局势“威胁着东南亚集体防御条约所适用的国家中的一个国家的主权完整和政治独立”。这个侵略集团正在“关切地等待观察小组到老挝去和它的调查报告”。
    上述情况表明，这个侵略集团正在等待一旦完成由美国主持的为干涉老挝制造“根据”的步骤以后，伺机直接干涉老挝局势；而泰国在美国策划的这个肮脏的阴谋中，扮演了一个积极推波助澜和帮助拉扯其它国家下水的危险的角色。
    在此以前，就在美国加紧策划武装干涉老挝局势的同时，泰国总理乃沙立和副总理乃他侬都曾经在10日叫嚷要干涉老挝。乃他侬宣称，在培·萨纳尼空政府通过东南亚条约组织向泰国提出要求的时候，泰国就将派兵到老挝去。
    同一天，乃沙立还宣布，泰国即将派遣一个包括有陆、海、空军代表的军事代表团到老挝去，这个代表团还将尽可能地到靠近老挝内战的战斗地区。
    此间观察家指出，从泰国政府的上述活动看来，它已经悍然走上追随美国破坏印度支那和东南亚地区和平的危险道路。泰国当局的这种做法只会为它自己带来不利的后果。
