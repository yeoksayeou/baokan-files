Xinhua News Agency, 11th - According to the Indian News Service: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in the People's Assembly on September 4th in response to an informal proposal by members of parliament requesting India to submit the Tibet issue to the United Nations. The full text is as follows:

Mr. Deputy Speaker, honorable members, the proposal put forward by the member seems quite simple; it is a simply worded proposal. However, as the course of this debate has shown, behind that proposal lie important international issues and significant matters with serious consequences. I think everyone in this House has the deepest sympathy for the suffering of the Tibetan people. There is no doubt about this. Everyone knows that we have not only granted asylum to the Dalai Lama but also to nearly 13,000 others. In fact, we have granted asylum to everyone who has come. I don't recall that in this matter concerning Tibet we have refused asylum to any single person. This in itself proves our feelings in this matter.

But, setting aside emotions, setting aside our sympathy for the Tibetans, what exactly should we do on this issue? Even – let's say – to express this feeling of sympathy, what exactly should we do? Some honorable members have made quite brave remarks about the bad things done by other countries. It is very easy to talk about these things; it is very easy to find many faults in the actions of various countries. But if a country like India is to play a role, we must play it in a mature way, in a well-considered way, in a way that at least can hope to achieve some results. It is absolutely – I should politely say – meaningless for us to make brave gestures; and if these brave gestures have a reactive and counterproductive effect on us, and thus harm us, or harm the cause we want to promote, then it is worse than meaningless.

Regarding this Tibet issue, we can examine it from many perspectives – history, culture, and other content related to India and China, etc. It is a long and intricate history, and we do not need to study it in detail. In the case of a country with a long and intricate history, it will have ample material, it will provide ample material, for any party to use to support any claim. The Chinese say that Tibet was under their sovereignty or suzerainty in the past. I don't know what term they used for hundreds of years. The Tibetans say that they were independent during many periods, except for the periods when they were forced into some form of subjugation. Indeed, this may be interesting for historians, but it is of no help to us. Of course, in fact, for a period of about forty years or so, actually, from the time of the demise of the Manchu Dynasty, or shortly after that, Tibet was virtually independent. Even so, it was not 100 percent; even so, China never abandoned its claim of sovereignty. But in reality, it was independent.

As I said, it doesn't help us much. Of course, if this issue were to arise in the International Court of Justice in The Hague – of course, it won't; such issues don't arise there because national states don't bring such issues there, and China, in any case, has nothing to do with the International Court of Justice in The Hague – they might consider all these issues.

There are two or three main considerations: Internationally, Tibet has not been regarded as an independent country. It has always been regarded as an autonomous region but under the suzerainty or sovereignty of China. Before India's independence, the United Kingdom, Russia – not just the Soviet Union, but also Tsarist Russia before it – viewed it this way – these were the main relevant countries. Other countries in the world, except for saying that Tibet was some kind of mysterious land, paid no attention to it at all.

This was the situation when India became independent, and we more or less inherited the situation from the British rule, inheriting both its good and bad aspects, and we continued for the time being. We didn't like many things there – I'm referring to the extraterritorial privileges we enjoyed there, which were definitely remnants of British imperialism in Tibet. We were not particularly happy about this, but in the first year or two, we were too busy to intervene in anything.

Subsequently, this Chinese invasion or intrusion into Tibet occurred. We have never denied China's dominant position in Tibet, call it whatever you like. This has always been the case, and even in recent years, we have not denied it. Even after independence, even before the People's Government of China arrived there, we did not deny it. In fact, we acted somewhat as if we recognized it.

Now, when this happened, we had to face a difficult situation legally, and legally, because of what we accepted and what the world accepted, we couldn't say anything. But we felt quite distressed and uneasy about the way things happened, the military advance, and what appeared to be a military conquest and occupation of Tibet. In those days, we sent notes, sent one or two modestly worded notes, expressing the hope that the issue would be resolved peacefully. I seem to remember that the wording of the reply we received from the Chinese government at that time was not equally modest. I'm speaking from memory...

Member: That's a fact.

Nehru: That's a fact. I'm talking about the sequence of events; I'm speaking from memory.

Later, El Salvador, a member of the United Nations, proposed some motion on the Tibet issue at the United Nations. This motion proposed that the issue be included on the agenda of the General Assembly and also proposed a draft resolution condemning what they called unprovoked aggression against Tibet and recommending the appointment of a committee to study appropriate measures to be taken.

There was some discussion about the issue of including an item on the agenda. The Indian representative – I believe the representative this time was Jam Saheb of Nawanagar – argued that the issue could be resolved peacefully and that it was best not to discuss it in this way. He also said, I believe, that we had received some assurances from the Chinese government that they wanted to resolve the issue peacefully through negotiations, and therefore, it was best not to include this item on the agenda for the time being. The United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, the Soviet Union, and even the so-called Nationalist China in Formosa – undoubtedly for some reason of its own – supported this suggestion. This item was deferred for discussion. The deferment was agreed upon.

On what basis did Jam Saheb say that we had received assurances from the Chinese government? I'm very sorry, I didn't bring the exact documents, but according to my memory, we received letters from the Chinese government in response to our opinions and our requests. The letters stated that they would resolve the issue through negotiations and peaceful means. In fact, I believe that their troops had stopped advancing somewhere near the eastern border of Tibet.

At that time, some representatives of the Tibetan government sent by the Dalai Lama were also about to go to Beijing to discuss the issue. At that time, until recently, the most convenient and simplest route for people to go from Lhasa to Beijing was through India. It was much more difficult to take routes through the Gobi Desert and such places. In fact, even after the People's Government of China took power, on several occasions, many Chinese officials travelled to Tibet via India. This route was simpler: from Calcutta straight north to Gangtok in Sikkim, continuing through the Nathu La pass. The Tibetan representatives came to Delhi on their way to Beijing. This was more natural. I also believe that they wanted to consult with us. This happened ten years ago. I don't remember the sequence of events very clearly. I know they stayed in Delhi for quite a long time. I'm not sure why. Anyway, they did. It was this sequence of events that led us to make this suggestion at the United Nations, and as a result, that issue was not discussed.

Later, in fact, no proper negotiations were conducted with the delegation sent by Tibet. Long before they arrived in Beijing, other developments occurred in Tibet. I think the Chinese army began to advance again, and then the Dalai Lama and his representatives reached an agreement with them. Of course, this agreement may have been signed under pressure due to the circumstances, but it was an agreement signed by representatives of the Dalai Lama, etc.

In this regard, may I say this? Mr. Vajpayee said that the Dalai Lama reached the seventeen-article agreement with China because I had made certain guarantees to him. He also said that this happened after the Chinese Premier visited India. He's confusing things. There was no question of me making any guarantees to him, the Chinese Premier did not come to India, and I did not go to China. I did not meet with the Chinese Premier at the time when the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama's government concluded this so-called seventeen-article agreement or anything like it. Therefore, there was no question of us making any guarantees. We only accepted – based on the letters received from the Chinese government – what Jam Saheb said in the United Nations Security Council, which was that the Chinese said they wanted to resolve the issue peacefully, and based on that, the issue was not discussed.

After this, the seventeen-article agreement was signed, which placed some emphasis on Tibetan autonomy. It is also wrong to say that the emphasis on autonomy in the agreement was due to our pressure and our wishes. Indeed, it was undoubtedly our wish, but we were not there when the agreement was signed; we were not asked for our opinions. This was a matter between the Chinese government and the Tibetans. Therefore, the claim that they had given us guarantees and then broken those guarantees is not correct.

The actual situation is that, years later, when Premier Zhou Enlai came here, we talked to him about the Tibet issue, and the Dalai Lama was also here at the time. I believe these talks were indeed initiated by Premier Zhou Enlai, who wanted to explain to me – and he did explain – that their attitude towards Tibet was not because he wanted to answer some accusations I had made, nor because he felt it was his duty to do so, but because he believed – I think – that we had friendly relations and he had to try to convince me of China's attitude on this issue.

He began by telling me that Tibet had always been a part of China. "Always" meant for thousands of years. Sometimes when China was weak, this sovereignty was not formally exercised, but he said that Tibet had always been a part of China. That was his argument. He also said that Tibet was not mainland China but a part of China. The people living there were not Han Chinese. The Chinese were Han, but there were also Mongols, Manchus, and Tibetans, etc. He said that Tibet was not a province of China but an autonomous region of China, and we were willing to respect this autonomy. That's what he said to me. He continued, in fact, some people thought we wanted to force communism on Tibet, which was absurd, because the Tibetans, specifically, were so backward that communism was far removed from Tibet's current situation. But he said that Tibet was definitely a very backward country, and we hoped to help them make progress in social, economic, and other aspects.

Even at that time – that is, three years ago, within Tibet, or rather on the eastern border of Tibet, especially in the area that did not belong to mainland Tibet but was actually inhabited by Tibetans, that is, in the Kham region on the eastern border of Tibet, but inhabited by Tibetans, there was some kind of entanglement. This area had been incorporated into China not long ago; I don't remember when, but anyway not now, but before all this happened. The Tibetans living there, the Khampas, were not happy to accept certain measures taken by China, because although the Chinese government never carried out any so-called land reform or any other reforms, in the sense that it allowed mainland Tibet to remain more or less as it was, it firmly controlled Tibet politically. But they did not interfere – Premier Zhou Enlai told me this: "We don't want to interfere; let them develop gradually." However, in this eastern region that was considered a part of China – they treated this region as a part of China – this ultimately led to a rebellion by the Khampas there – this was a guerrilla-style rebellion, which had been going on for quite some time when Premier Zhou Enlai came here three years ago – a year or more. We didn't talk about this issue at the time. But he mentioned this issue, he said: We don't want to interfere in Tibet's internal structure, internal autonomy, social customs, religion, etc.; but we certainly will not tolerate rebellion and foreign interference. Of course, I don't know what he meant or thought of when he said foreign interference or imperialist interference, but I found that they had some peculiar ideas in their minds, and I think they didn't think that India had much to do with this, but that some foreign countries, the United Kingdom or the United States, had somehow invaded Tibet, because these countries were firmly in their minds. They did not fully understand that the United Kingdom had not been interested in Tibet at all since leaving India. They couldn't reach Tibet at all. They had no agencies, no representatives there; they didn't even have anyone there who could provide them with any information.

As far as I know, in fact, the United States also had no agencies or representatives there. Among all other countries, only India had representatives stationed in Tibet, namely the Indian Consul General. There may also be Soviet representatives; there may also be Mongolian representatives. But I mean to say that there were no Europeans or Americans there. In any case, that's what he told me: – the rebellion was continuing. That was the situation in our meeting, call it whatever you like. But it seemed to me like an explanation. This was not some guarantee that I had obtained from Premier Zhou Enlai. I'm saying this because someone might say: Are you doing this because you received that kind of guarantee? In that sense, it was not a guarantee. This kind of talk about Tibetan autonomy, etc., did make me happy when I heard it. But I have no right to call him to account and say to him: You made a guarantee, but you didn't fulfill it; in this sense, although I must say that I was saddened when the autonomous structure completely collapsed due to other developments.

This internal rebellion in Tibet gradually spread month after month, year after year. It slowly spread from east to west. I personally have no doubt that although most Tibetans did not participate in the rebellion during this period, they sympathized with the rebellion; I have no doubt about this. This is due to some obvious reasons that are not very profound, due to the simple reason that Tibetans, like other people, have strong nationalistic feelings; and when they feel that outsiders are coming in to disrupt their lives and all the structures in which they live, they resent these things. So it spread, and then other things happened.

We don't need to study the detailed history, but the disputes in Lhasa itself, I think, may have been caused in part by the various activities of the Chinese government. When rulers, outsiders, foreign rulers, have to deal with unfriendly residents, well, the relationship is easy to imagine. That won't be a healthy relationship. The rulers and the people fear each other. When fear dominates the relationship between the two sides, it is very likely to cause bad results. In fact, there will be unhealthy relationships in every place where a country becomes a subordinate country. This led to this turmoil in Tibet and the Dalai Lama fleeing from Lhasa to India and such things. After that, I did not receive any accurate information about what was happening there.

I think we can generally say that several parts of Tibet have been subjected to strong military pressure, and under the rule of the military government there, the Tibetans have not enjoyed autonomy by any means. It is possible that the news we have heard about the situation in Tibet is exaggerated, because most of the news inevitably comes from refugees, and refugees, no matter how good they are, are prone to providing exaggerated accounts because they have suffered themselves, accounts of things that they have seen or heard. This is how it is passed on. Therefore, this news may be exaggerated. As a responsible person, I cannot repeat this news until I have some proof. But, whether this news is exaggerated or not, there is no doubt that many regrettable things have happened in Tibet, the people of Tibet have suffered a lot, and, it certainly cannot be said that it is a happy family living together.

Previously, when this issue was raised in this House, I said that our attitude towards these issues is governed by two or three factors. I mentioned two of them – our sympathy for the Tibetan people and our desire to maintain friendly relations with China. It may seem somewhat contradictory now; in the current situation, these two factors are indeed somewhat contradictory. This is the difficulty of the situation. But we have not abandoned our basic attitude governed by these two factors because of this. The third factor, of course, is and will always be the integrity and freedom of India. Protecting this is our primary responsibility.

Why do I say this? Because, I want to say it again: any steps we may take now cannot be taken in a fit of anger – if I may say so – cannot be taken because we are angry, so we do something without considering the consequences of this step. We do things not only for the present, but also for the future – for the distant future. I have always believed that it is very important, even indispensable – if you will – for India and China, these two Asian countries, to maintain friendly and cooperative relations as much as possible. In the two thousand years of relations between India and China, there has never been any form of military conflict between them, which is a remarkable historical fact – I believe you will not find the same situation at any time, in any other place. These are cultural relations. These are trade relations to some extent. These are religious ties. In these long periods, they were not passive countries. They were active, aggressive countries. In those days, unlike in India's later days – when we were indeed bound by the caste system, passive, lifeless, not crossing the seas, not contacting this person, not meeting that person – they wanted the kind of country we have developed – our people engaged in adventurous undertakings. They went to all parts of Southeast Asia. They established colonies. They did not establish imperialist colonies, but independent colonies. In fact, India's influence throughout Southeast Asia is enormous. You can see this influence today. China's influence there is also enormous. Therefore, these two huge, powerful countries often met, but they never had any conflicts. This is a remarkable historical fact. Undoubtedly, you will not find such an example in Europe or in Asia.

Now, in my opinion, if we form some kind of long-term adversarial state, then in the future, this will be a tragedy not only for India, perhaps for China, but also for Asia and the whole world. If you are weak, if you are considered a weak country, there will be no natural friendship. There can be no friendship between the weak and the strong, nor can there be friendship between a country that tries to bully others and a country that is willing to be bullied. This does not happen, whether for individuals or collectives or countries. Only when people are somewhat equal, when people respect each other, are they friends. The same goes for countries. But under such conditions, we have indeed striven for Indian-Chinese friendship. I want to say that, despite what has happened and is happening now, this is still our goal, and we will continue to work towards it. But this does not mean that we should succumb to anything we believe is right, or that we should cede a part of Indian territory to China to please it. This is not the way to make friends with anyone or maintain our dignity or self-respect. But in the long run, it is very important for these two great powers to be friends, regardless of their internal structures and policies.

I know that sometimes, when people hear annoying things, irritating things, when we see that our people are not even treated politely, when we receive letters from the Chinese government that are peculiarly lacking in even ordinary courtesy, it is difficult to have friendly feelings. All this is annoying. But it is very easy for people to get angry and annoyed. Undoubtedly, it is necessary for those in responsible positions not to get annoyed, to maintain the dignity of the country and the continuity of our policies.

Many people accuse us of asking, what about your famous Panchsheel; where are the Five Principles; are they dead, disappeared, buried, or cremated? Well, say whatever you like. This shows a completely wrong attitude towards this issue. What is Panchsheel? Panchsheel or the Five Principles – they are not principles because they are embodied in the treaty between India and China – they are in themselves the principles of true international relations, and we have always believed that these principles are correct, and even if the whole world denies these principles, we still adhere to these principles. Of course, it is very clear that if the other party does not agree with these principles, then this relationship does not exist. But the principles are still correct. When people become wise enough, they will re-accept these principles. Therefore, there is no question of Panchsheel having shortcomings. If you will, it can be said to be a question of India having shortcomings or China having shortcomings. But the principles still exist. That's the view.

If you allow me to deviate slightly from the scope of this proposal, then I want to say that we must face some difficult situations on our borders and elsewhere: regarding the treatment of our people in Tibet by the Chinese authorities. I can tell the People's Assembly that the first thing I do every morning is to open a bundle of telegrams, a fairly large bundle. I estimate that at least five or six telegrams in each bundle are from Beijing, Lhasa, Gyantse, or Yatung about this issue, and these telegrams all state the latest developments. Of course, the telegrams we receive from Gyantse, Yatung, and Lhasa cannot tell us what is happening in Tibet, because they have no contact with other parts of Tibet. They can only see more or less the situation around the consulate and the trading post, and then tell us what the situation is like today. Some small problems have occurred. Almost every morning, usually at least when I start my work for the day, these telegrams do not put me in a very pleasant mood. I try to overcome this mood. Now I have slowly become accustomed to doing so to some extent.

We must deal with these difficult issues, these border incidents. If someone asks me – people sometimes ask me – what these border incidents indicate, honestly, I don't know what the other party is thinking, whether this is just a local act of aggression, or just to keep us in line – if I can use this colloquial expression – not to think too highly of ourselves, or whether there are deeper reasons, I don't know.

I can tell the People's Assembly that just last night, we received a fairly long reply from the Chinese government. This was in response to the protests I made a few days ago regarding these incidents in the Northeast Frontier. It was a rather long reply. Naturally, it needs to be considered very carefully. But, in general, this reply denies our accusations that they invaded our territory and fired on our patrols there, and instead accuses us of invading their territory and firing on them. This is completely inconsistent with the facts, is contrary to the facts in this regard.

Member: Contrary to the McMahon Line.

Nehru: Of course, we will carefully study this reply, because it is a long note that more or less presents arguments, talking about many places and other things. We will soon, that is, in two or three days, send them a reply.

Let me repeat what I have said here again, before the adjournment of this session of the People's Assembly, I hope to submit to the People's Assembly a white paper including the correspondence exchanged between the Chinese government and our government since the signing of the treaty on Tibet between India and China – that is, in the past five years – so that the People's Assembly can understand the background of what has been happening.

That's the whole thing. On the one hand, we must naturally protect our borders. When I say this, I hope to restrain myself, and restrain my strong reactions, not to go too far in terms of – let's say – military measures or such things; because when countries become excited, and things involve their entire prestige, then they are often gradually pushed in the wrong direction. Therefore, we try to maintain a balance in any case, that is, to take a firm policy in the occasions where we think we are correct, but always open the door for reconciliation, open the door for solving the problem, as long as this is possible.

In general, regarding this border – that is, the border incident I just mentioned, they said we carried out aggression. Whether this village or that village or this small piece of territory is on their side or on our side is a matter of fact. In general, as long as these disputes are relatively small disputes, I do think that if two large countries or two small countries immediately rush up and grab each other by the neck to decide whether this two-mile piece of territory is on this side or that side, especially if this territory is an uninhabited two-mile piece of territory in the mountains, that is quite ridiculous. But when things involve the prestige and dignity of the country, then it is not a two-mile piece of territory. What is involved here is the dignity and self-respect of the country. Therefore, this kind of thing happens. But, I don't want – as long as I can do it – to bring this problem to the point where no country has any other way – because their national dignity is involved here – but to resort to force. This is not what I want...

Dr. Ram Subhag Singh: According to recent reports, where is the boundary? According to the latest reply we received from them, where is the boundary they are talking about?

Nehru: Without large maps and various small maps about villages, etc., how can I say? Currently, the dispute on this issue is a relatively small issue; whether it may be on this side or that side two miles away, this is not a big issue; but I don't know what their maps look like here, there, and elsewhere. As far as I am concerned, I often say that the boundary from the border with Burma all the way to the border with Bhutan is the McMahon Line, and we insist on this line.

A Member: Are they...?

Nehru: Please let me continue, please do not overemphasize the news published in the newspapers. What I say on this issue is more authoritative.

This is the McMahon Line, and we insist on this line. We believe that it is very inappropriate and very improper for the Chinese government to continue to publish a map that draws half of the Northeast Frontier Agency, one-third of Assam, and one-third of Bhutan as if they belong to China. This is indeed an offense. I can understand that some things and some mistakes happen for a period of time; but year after year, a total of ten years, continuing to say to us: "Well, we will study this issue when we have time", this is not a good answer. That's the situation.

However, after generally accepting the McMahon Line, I am prepared to discuss any interpretations of the McMahon Line; interpretations of minor parts here or there – that is a different issue – not these large pieces of territory, but interpretations of minor parts, to determine whether this small hill is here or that small place is on this side or that side, all based on the facts, based on maps and existing evidence. This is what I am prepared to discuss with the Chinese government. I am prepared to accept any conciliatory, mediating method to consider this issue, I am prepared to have these minor amendments arbitrated by authorities agreed upon by both parties when they or we – whichever side it is – raise objections. This is a different issue. I say this because I do not take the narrow attitude that everything I say is right and everything others say is wrong. But the overall McMahon Line must be accepted, as far as we are concerned, it exists, and we accept it.

The situation regarding Ladakh is somewhat different. The McMahon Line does not extend there. It is governed by an old treaty of more than a hundred years signed by Maharaja Gulab Singh, the then ruler of Kashmir (who was a vassal of the Sikh rulers of Punjab at the time). This was in the 1830s. On the one hand, there was the treaty of 1842, and on the other hand, there were the rulers of Lhasa and the representatives of the Chinese Emperor, and the result was that Ladakh was recognized as part of the state of Kashmir.

No one has ever objected to this, and no one is objecting to it now, but the border between Ladakh and Tibet is not very carefully demarcated. To some extent, it was demarcated by British officers who went there, but I rather doubt whether they conducted a careful survey, they just drew the line. This line has always been marked on our maps. They did this. Since no one lives there, it generally doesn't matter much. It didn't matter much in the past either. No one paid attention to it at the time.

Now the problem has arisen. We are prepared to sit down and discuss these minor issues. But under what conditions should we discuss them? First, the treaties, the existing maps, etc. Second, the customary practices, those things that have been customary over the years. Third, the geography. What I mean by geography refers to natural features such as watersheds and mountain ranges, rather than a small piece of divided plain. These are convenient terrains for defining international boundaries.

I have specifically mentioned all these issues when talking about this proposal, which involves a relatively simple issue. Now, returning to this proposal, regardless of the sympathy that the proposer and some other members have for the Tibetan people, if we take an action, this action should be based on a legal and constitutional basis, we should hope that it will produce some results, produce some results that will help us achieve the goals we seek.

From the point of view of whether it is well-founded, the United Nations may intervene for two reasons. One reason is the violation of human rights, and the other reason is aggression. But the violation of human rights only applies to those who have accepted the United Nations Charter, in other words, only to those who have accepted the Charter and are member states of the United Nations. Strictly speaking, you cannot apply the Charter to those who have not accepted the Charter and have not been allowed to participate in the United Nations. That's the situation.

Secondly, if you talk about aggression, the issue of an independent sovereign state invading another independent sovereign state; as I have said to you, as far as world affairs are concerned, Tibet has not been recognized as an independent country for quite some time, even long before this happened – let alone after this happened. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret it as aggression.

You may say that these arguments are some rather legalistic arguments. But I am only pointing out any difficulties and procedural constitutional aspects involved. Next, I want to talk about a practical aspect. That is, what good would doing this do? Suppose we overcome the legal ambiguities and legal difficulties. The result may be a debate in the United Nations General Assembly or Security Council – wherever this issue is raised – a heated debate, an angry debate, a debate conducted in the manner of the Cold War. After this debate is conducted, what will the initiator of this debate and the initiator of this motion do? There is nothing else to do. They will go home. After bringing things to a higher temperature, to a high heat, they will go home. They have fulfilled their responsibilities, because they have no other way.

Obviously, no one will send troops to Tibet or China, because that was not done in the Hungarian event; Hungary is part of Europe and has more connections with European countries. It would be absurd to think that they would do that in Tibet. Obviously, that will not happen. Therefore, what will happen is that some other countries will express some strong opinions, deny them, and then this issue will develop to the extent of the Cold War – be pulled into the realm of the Cold War – and will probably cause a reaction in the Chinese government, and these reactions will be even more unfavorable to Tibet and the Tibetan people than they are now. Therefore, the final result will not be something comforting for the Tibetan people, but the opposite.

This issue is ambiguous from both a constitutional and legal point of view. In fact, people who have studied this issue believe that it is difficult to bring it there. From a practical point of view, there will be no good results. Then, apart from possibly satisfying some inner desire to express sympathy or to express our indignation, what is the purpose of putting this issue up for discussion? I can certainly understand this inner desire. But we must never be dominated by this desire, let it lead us into an unknown and dangerous situation. Therefore, I cannot agree to this proposal, and I would advise the People's Assembly not to agree to it either.

    尼赫鲁9月4日在印度人民院的讲话
    新华社11日讯　据印度新闻处报道：印度总理尼赫鲁9月4日在人民院答复议员提出的要求印度把西藏问题提交联合国的非正式提案时，发表了讲话，全文如下：
    副议长，先生，议员先生提出的提案看来相当简单，是一项措词简单的提案。但是，正如这场辩论的过程已经表明的，在那个提案背后包含着重要的国际问题和具有重大后果的重大问题。我想，本院的每一个人对西藏人民的苦难都怀有最深切的同情的感情。这一点是没有疑问的。人人都知道，我们不但给予达赖喇嘛避难权，而且对其他将近一万三千人都给予了避难权。事实上，我们对所有来到的人都给予了避难权。我记不得在这次有关西藏的事情中有过我们拒绝给那一个人避难权的事。这本身就证明了我们在这件事上的感情。
    但是，撇开感情不谈，撇开我们对西藏人的同情不谈，我们在这个问题上到底应该做些什么呢？即使是——让我们说——为了表达这种同情的感情，我们到底应该作些什么呢？有些议员先生对其它国家所作的坏事发表了相当勇敢的言论。谈论这些事情是十分容易的，要在各国的行为中找出许多错处是十分容易的。但是如果像印度这样的一个国家要发挥作用的话，我们必须以成熟的方式，以经过深思熟虑的方式，以至少可以有希望获得某种结果的方式来发挥作用。由我们来作出勇敢的姿态是绝对——我应该有礼貌地说——没有意义的；如果这些勇敢的姿态对我们发生反作用和反效果，并且因此伤害到我们，或者伤害到我们想要促进的事业，那就比没有意义还要坏。
    就这个西藏问题而论，我们可以从许多观点——同印度和中国等等的历史、文化以及其它内容——来考察它。这是悠久的、错综复杂的历史，我们不需要详细研究它。在一个国家有悠久和错综复杂的历史的情况下，它就会有充分的材料，它就会提供充分的材料，供任何一方用来支持任何要求。中国人说，西藏过去处在他们的主权或者宗主权之下。我不知道几百年来他们用的是什么字眼。西藏人说，他们在许多时期内是独立的，除了他们被迫处于某种屈从状态的时期以外。真的，这对历史学者来说也许是有趣的，但是对我们却并无帮助。当然，事实上在四十年左右的一段时期以后，实际上，从满洲王朝灭亡的时候起，或者是在那时以后不久，西藏实际上是独立的。即使这样，也并不是百分之百的；即使这样，中国也从来没有放弃其主权要求。但是实际上它是独立的。
    正像我所说的，它对我们并没有很大的帮助。当然，如果这个问题在海牙国际法庭出现——当然那是不会的；这种问题不会在那里出现，因为民族国家并不把这种问题提到那里去，而中国无论如何是同海牙国际法庭毫无关系的——他们是可能考虑这一切问题的。
    有两三个主要的考虑是：从国际上考虑，西藏没有被认为是独立国。它一直被认为是自治国，但是处在中国的宗主权或主权之下。在印度独立前，联合王国、俄国——不只是苏联，而且也是在它之前的沙皇俄国——就是这样认为的——这些是主要的有关国家。世界上其它国家，除了说西藏是某种神秘之邦而外，对它是毫不注意的。
    当印度独立时，情况就是这样，我们或多或少继承了在英国统治时代的情况，它的好的和不好的东西都继承下来了，我们暂时继续下去。我们并不喜欢那里的许多事情——我指的是我们在那里所享有的治外法权的特权，它们肯定是英帝国主义在西藏的残余。这不是我们特别高兴的，但是在头一两年，我们太忙，而不能对任何事情进行干预。
    其后发生了这次中国入侵或侵犯西藏的事。我们从来都没有否认中国对西藏的统治地位，不管你们高兴叫它什么都可以。情况一直是这样，即使在最近几年来，我们也没有否认过它。即使在独立后，即使在中国人民政府到达那里之前，我们也没有否认过它。事实上，我们多少是以仿佛我们承认它的方式采取行动的。
    现在，当这件事发生时，我们不得不在法律上面临困难的形势，而且从法律上说，由于我们所接受的和世界接受的情况，我们不能说什么话。但是我们对于事情发生的那种方式，军队进军以及看来是武力征服和占领西藏的情况，感到相当痛苦和不安。在那些日子里，我们发出了照会，发出了一两个措辞谦逊的照会，表示希望这个问题会得到和平解决。我仿佛记得我们当时从中国政府得到的答复的措词不是同样谦逊的。我是就我所记忆的来讲的……
    议员：这是事实。
    尼赫鲁：这是事实。我是在谈事情发生的前后次序；我是凭记忆谈的。
    后来联合国会员国萨尔瓦多在联合国就西藏问题提出某种动议。这个动议主张把这个问题列入大会议程，同时还提出决议草案，谴责据他们说是对西藏的无端的侵略，并且建议任命一个委员会来研究所要采取的适当的措施。
    关于这个把一项问题列入议程的问题进行了一些讨论。印度代表——我相信这次代表是纳瓦纳加的詹萨赫布——辩论说，这个问题可以和平解决，最好还是不要以这种方式讨论这个问题。他又说，我相信，我们曾经从中国政府那里得到一些保证：他们想用谈判的方法和平解决这个问题，因此，暂时不要把这一项列入议程。联合王国、美国、澳大利亚、苏联甚至在福摩萨的那个所谓国民党中国——毫无疑问是由于它自己的某种理由——支持这个建议。这一项就延期讨论。延期讨论是得到同意的。
    詹萨赫布说，我们从中国政府那里得到了保证，他是根据什么而这样说的呢？我很抱歉，我没有带来确切的文件，可是根据我的记忆，我们从中国政府那里接到了函件，这个函件是答复我们的意见和我们的要求的。函件中说他们要用谈判以及和平的方式解决这个问题。事实上，我相信，他们的军队已经在接近西藏东部边界的某个地方停止前进。
    当时，达赖喇嘛派遣的西藏政府的一些代表也即将到北京去讨论这个问题。在那时，一直到最近，人们从拉萨到北京去的最方便和最简单的路线是通过印度。取道戈壁沙漠之类的地方要困难得多。事实上，甚至在中国人民政府执政以后，有好几次，有许多中国人取道印度前往西藏。这条路线比较简单：从加尔各答一直往北到锡金的甘托克通过纳都拉山口继续前进。西藏代表在前往北京途中来到了德里。这是比较自然的。我也认为，他们要和我们商谈。这是发生在十年以前的事情。我记不太清楚事情发生的前后次序。我知道，他们在德里呆了相当长的时间。到底什么原因，我不清楚。总之，他们这样做了。正是事情的这个前后经过使我们在联合国提出这个建议，因而那个问题没有讨论。
    后来，事实上没有同西藏派出的代表团进行适当的谈判。在他们到达北京以前很久，在西藏出现了其它事态发展。我想，中国军队再度开始进军，接着达赖喇嘛和他的代表同他们达成了协议。当然，这个协议可能是为形势所迫而在压力下签订的，但是这是代表达赖喇嘛等签订的协议。
    在这方面，我可以这样说吗？巴志帕伊议员先生说，达赖喇嘛之所以同中国达成了十七条协议，是由于我向他提出了某些保证。他又说，这是中国总理访问了印度以后的事。他把这种事情弄混了。根本不存在我向他提出任何保证的问题，中国总理没有到印度来，我也没有到中国去。在中华人民共和国和达赖喇嘛政府缔结这个所谓十七条协议之类的东西的时候，我没有同中国总理见面。因此根本不存在我们提出任何保证的问题。我们接受的只是——根据从中国政府那里接到的信件——詹萨赫布在联合国安全理事会里说的话，这就是中国人说他们希望和平解决这个问题，根据这种情况，这一点就没有讨论。
    在这以后，就签订了这个十七条协议，这个协议中对西藏自治给予某种强调。如果说协议中之所以强调自治是出于我们的压力和我们的愿望这也是错误的。的确，这无疑是我们的愿望，但是当协议签订时，我们并没有在那里；也没有要求我们表示意见。这是中国政府和西藏人之间的事情。因此关于他们曾经向我们提出保证，后来又破坏了这种保证的说法是不正确的。
    实际情况是，几年以后，当周恩来总理来到这里的时候，我们曾经同他谈到西藏问题，当时达赖喇嘛也在这里。我相信这种会谈的确是周恩来总理倡议的，他希望向我解释——他的确解释说——他们之所以对西藏采取这样的态度不是由于他要回答我提出的一些指责，也不是因为他认为他有责任这样作，而是因为他认为——我想是这样——我们有着友好的关系，他必须设法使我相信中国在这个问题上采取的态度。
    他一开始就对我说，西藏一向是中国的一部分。“一向”的意思就是千百年。有时当中国软弱的时候，这种主权就没有正式地行使，但是他说，西藏一向是中国的一部分。他的论点就是这样。他又说，但是西藏不是中国本部，而是中国的一部分。那里居住的不是汉人。中国人是汉人，但是还有蒙古人、满洲人和西藏人等等。他说，西藏并不是中国的省份，而是中国的自治区，我们愿意尊重这种自治。这就是他对我说的话。他继续说，事实上某些人认为我们想强迫西藏接受共产主义，那是荒谬的，因为西藏人，具体说，非常落后，以致共产主义同西藏目前的情况相距甚远。但是他说，西藏肯定是非常落后的国家，我们希望使他们在社会、经济等等方面取得进展。
    甚至在那时——就是三年前，在西藏内部，或者不如说在西藏东部边境上，特别是在那并不属于西藏本部而实际上居民是西藏人的地区里，即在西藏东部边境上、但居民是西藏人的康地区里，发生了某种纠葛。这个地区不久前已并入中国；我记不得什么时候，但是反正不是现在，而是在这一切发生之前。住在那里的西藏人即康巴人，并不乐意接受中国的某些措施，因为中国政府虽然从没有进行任何所谓土地改革或者其他任何改革的意义上说，是让西藏本部多少保持着原状的，在政治上却牢牢地控制着西藏。但是他们没有进行干涉——周恩来总理是这样对我说的：“我们不想进行干涉；让他们自己逐步发展。”但是，在这个被认为是中国一部分的东部地区——他们是把这个地区当作中国的一部分看待的——这一点最终导致了那里的康巴人的叛乱——这是游击式的叛乱，这种叛乱在周恩来总理三年前来到这里时已经持续了相当时候——一年或一年以上了。我们当时没有谈这个问题。但是他提到了这个问题，他说：我们不想干涉西藏的内部结构、内部自治、社会习俗、宗教等等事情；但是我们当然不会容忍叛乱和外国干涉。当然罗，我不知道他在说外国干涉或者帝国主义干涉的时候指的或者想的是什么，但是我发现他们的头脑中有着某种奇特的观念，我认为他们想的倒不怎么是印度同这件事有什么关系，而是一些外国，联合王国或美国，不知怎的侵入了西藏，因为他们的头脑里牢牢记着这些国家。他们没有十分了解到，联合王国自从离开印度以来对西藏压根儿不感兴趣。他们根本不能达到西藏。他们在那里没有机构，没有代表；他们在那里甚至没有谁可向他们提供任何消息。
    据我所知，事实上，美国在那里也没有机构或代表。在其它任何国家中，唯有印度有代表驻在西藏，那就是印度的总领事。可能还有苏联的；也可能有蒙古的。但是我的意思是说，那里没有欧洲人，也没有美国人。无论如何他对我是这样说的：——叛乱在继续。这就是我们那次会谈的情形，你喜欢怎么叫它就怎么叫它。但是在我看来这倒是一种解释。这并不是我向周恩来总理索取得来的某种保证。我之所以这样说明，是因为可能有人会说：你这样做是否因为你得到了那种保证。从那个意义上讲，这并不是什么保证。这种关于西藏自治等等的谈话，在我听到的时候，确实使我感到高兴。但是我没有权利把他叫来责备一番，对他说：你作了保证，但是你没有履行；在这个意义上，虽然我必须说，当自治结构由于其他事态发展而完全垮台的时候，我感到痛苦。
    西藏的这一内部反叛月复一月、年复一年地渐渐蔓延开来。它慢慢地从东向西蔓延。我个人毫不怀疑，大多数西藏人虽然在这段时期内没有参加叛乱，但是却是同情叛乱的；我对这一点毫不怀疑。这是由于一些并不怎么高深的明显的原因，是由于这样一个简单的原因：西藏人像其他人一样，有着强烈的民族主义感情；当他们认为外来的人进来打乱了他们的生活和他们生活于其中的一切结构的时候，他们对这些事情就感到愤懑。因此这就蔓延了开来，接着又发生了其他事情。
    我们不必研究详细的历史，但是拉萨本身的纠纷，我想一部分当然可能是由于中国政府的各种活动引起的。当统治者、外来的人、外来的统治者不得不同不友好的居民打交道的时候，嗯，关系是很容易想像的。那不会是健康的关系。统治者和人民彼此惧怕对方。当恐惧支配了双方的关系的时候，那很可能会引起不良的结果。事实上在一个国家成为受支配的国家的一切地方，都会有不健康的关系。这样就引起了西藏的这次动乱和达赖喇嘛从拉萨逃走前来印度以及诸如此类的事情。在那以后，我没有得到任何有关那里发生的情况的确切消息。
    我想，我们可以一般地说，西藏的几个部分受到了强大的军事压力，在那里的军事政府的统治下，西藏人远没有享受到自治。可能我们所听到的关于西藏境内的情况的消息是言过其实的，因为大多数消息必然是从难民那里来的，而难民不管怎么好，由于自己吃过苦头，就容易提供经过渲染的情况，这种情况不是他们所看到的或者他们所听到的。就这样越传越甚。因此这些消息可能是言过其实的。作为一个负责的人，在我得到某种证明以前，我不能重述这些消息。但是，不论这些消息是不是言过其实，有一点是没有甚么可怀疑的，那就是：在西藏发生了许多令人遗憾的事情，西藏的人民吃了许多苦，而且，肯定不能说，那是生活在一起的一个幸福家庭。
    以前当这个问题在本院提出的时候，我说过，我们对这些问题的态度是受两、三个因素支配的。我提到了其中的两个——我们对西藏人民的同情和我们希望同中国保持友好关系的愿望。现在看来这或许有些矛盾，在目前情况下，这两个因素的确有点矛盾。这是局势的困难之处。可是我们并没有因此而放弃受这两个因素支配的我们的基本态度。第三个因素当然是而且将始终是印度的完整和印度的自由。保护这种东西是我们的首要责任。
    我为什么要说这番话呢？因为，我要再说一遍：我们现在可能采取的任何步骤是不能在怒气冲冲——如果我可以这样说的话——的情况下采取的，不能由于我们感到愤怒，于是就作出某种事情，而不顾这一步骤的后果如何。我们做事不仅是为目前，而且是为将来——为遥远的将来。我一向认为，印度和中国这两个亚洲国家应当保持友好的和尽可能合作的关系，这是很重要的，甚至是必不可缺的——如果你愿意这样说的话。在印中两国的两千年的关系中，它们之间没有发生过任何形式的军事冲突，这是一个了不起的历史事实——我相信你们在任何时候、在其他任何地方都找不到同样的情况。这是文化关系。这在某种程度上是贸易关系。这是宗教的联系。在这些很长的时期内，它们不是消极的国家。它们是活跃的、积极的国家。在这些日子里，不像在印度以后的日子那样——那时我们的确是受种姓制度束缚的、消极的、没有生气的国家，不渡海，不同这个人接触，不同那个人会见——，他们希望有我们发展起来的这种国家——我国人民从事冒险的事业。他们到东南海各地去。他们建立了殖民地。他们建立的不是帝国主义殖民地，而是独立的殖民地。事实上，印度在整个东南地区的影响是巨大的。你们今天可以看到这种影响。中国在那里的影响也是巨大的。因此，这两个巨大的、强大的国家经常相遇，可是它们没有发生过任何冲突。这是一个了不起的历史事实。无疑，你们在欧洲以及在亚洲都找不到这种事例。
    现在，在我看来，如果我们形成了某种长期的敌对状态，那末在将来，这不仅对印度、可能对中国来说会是一个悲剧，而且对亚洲和全世界来说也会是一个悲剧。如果你是软弱的，如果你被认为是一个软弱的国家，就不会有自然的友谊。在弱者和强者之间不可能存在友谊，在企图欺负别人的国家和甘愿受欺负的国家之间也不可能存在友谊。不论个人或集体或国家，都不会发生这种情况。只有在人们多少是平等的，人们互相尊敬的时候，他们才是朋友。国家也是一样。可是在符合这样的条件的情况下，我们的确曾经为印中友谊而努力。我要说，尽管有着已经发生的和现在正在发生的事情，这仍旧是我们的目的，我们将继续为此努力。可是这并不意味着我们应该在我们认为是正确的任何事情上屈服，或者我们应该让出一部分印度领土给中国来讨好它。这并不是同任何人交朋友或者保持我们的尊严或自尊的方法。可是从长远看来，这两个大国成为朋友是非常重要的，不论它们内部的结构和政策如何。
    我知道，有的时候，当人们听到恼人的事情、使人生气的事情，当我们看到我们的人甚至没有得到有礼貌的对待，当我们从中国政府那里接到一些连普通的礼貌都奇特地缺乏的信件时候，要有友好的感觉是困难的。这一切都是恼人的。但是人们生气和感到恼火是非常容易的。无疑，处于负责地位的人有必要不使自己恼火，以保持国家的威严以及我们政策的连续性。
    有许多人指责我们说，你们有名的潘查希拉怎么样了；五项原则那里去了；死亡了、消失了、埋葬了还是火葬了？好吧，你们爱说什么就说什么吧。这表明对这个问题采取了完全错误的态度。潘查希拉是什么呢？潘查希拉或者说五项原则——它们并不是因为体现在印中两国的条约之中而才成为原则的——它们本身就是国际真正关系的原则，我们过去一直认为这些原则是正确的，即使全世界都否定这些原则，我们还坚持这些原则。当然，很显然，如果对方不同意这些原则，那么这种关系就不存在了。可是原则仍然是正确的。当人们变得足够明智的时候，他们会重新接受这些原则。因此，并不存在潘查希拉有缺点的问题。如果你愿意说的话，这可以说是印度有缺点或者中国有缺点的问题。但是原则仍然存在。看法就是这样。
    如果你们允许我稍稍离开这项提案的范围，那么我要说，我们必须正视我们边境上和其他地方的某些困难情况：关于中国当局对我们在西藏的人的待遇。我可以告诉人民院，我每天早晨所做的第一件事情，就是打开一束电报，相当大的一束。我估计每一束电报中至少有五六封是从北京、拉萨、江孜或亚东来的关于这个问题的电报，这些电报都是陈述最新的事情，最新的发展情况的。当然，我们从江孜、亚东和拉萨收到的电报无法告诉我们西藏发生的情况，因为他们同西藏其他部分没有联系。他们只能够多多少少看到领事馆和商务处周围的一些情况，然后告诉我们今天的情况是怎样的。发生了一些小问题。几乎每天上午，通常至少在我开始一天的工作的时候，这些电报使我的情绪并不是太愉快的。我努力设法克服这种情绪。现在我在某种程度上已经慢慢习惯于这样做了。
    我们必须处理这些困难的问题，这些边境事件。要是有人问我——人们有时要问我——这些边境事件说明什么，老实说，我不知道对方心中是怎么想的，到底这仅仅是局部的侵略性行为呢，或者只是要让我们规规矩矩——如果我可以用这个俗语的话——，不要自以为了不起，还是有更深刻的原因，我不知道。
    我可以告诉人民院，就在昨天晚上，我们收到了中国政府一份相当长的复照。这是答复我在几天以前就东北边境发生的这些事件提出的抗议的。这是一份相当长的复照。自然需要非常仔细地加以考虑。但是概括地说，这份复照否认我们提出的关于他们侵犯我们的领土并且向我们在那里的巡逻队开枪的指责，而且指责我们侵犯他们的领土并且向他们开枪。这是完全与事实不符的，是违反这方面的事实的。
    议员：违反麦克马洪线。
    尼赫鲁：当然我们将仔细研究这个复照，因为它是一份长的、或多或少提出了论据的照会，里面谈到许多地方和其他事情。我们很快就要，也就是说，在两三天之内就要送给他们一份复照。
    请让我再重复一遍我在这里说过的话，在本届人民院会议休会以前，我希望向人民院提出包括自从印度和中国签订关于西藏的条约签订以来——也就是说在过去五年当中——中国政府和我国政府所交换的信件的白皮书，好让人民院了解一直在发生的事情的背景。
    整个事情就是这样。我们一方面自然要保护我们的边境。当我说这样的话的时候，我希望克制自己，并且约束一下我的强烈的反应，不要在——让我们说——军事措施之类的东西方面走得太远；因为当国家变得激动起来，并且事情牵涉到他们的全部威信的时候，那么他们常常会被逐渐推向错误的方向。因此我们设法无论如何保持平衡，这就是说，在我们认为我们是正确的场合采取坚定的政策，但是始终为和解敞开大门，为解决问题敞开大门，只要这是可能的。
    概括地说，关于这个边境——也就是我刚才说的边境事件，他们说我们进行了侵略。这个村庄或者那个村庄或者这一小片领土究竟是在他们一边呢，还是在我们一边呢，这是一个事实问题。一般说来，只要这些纠纷是比较小的纠纷，我的确认为，如果两个大国或者两个小国立即冲上去掐住对方的脖子来决定这块两英里的领土究竟是在这边还是在那边，特别是如果这块领土是高山上的无人居住的两英里的领土，那是相当荒唐可笑的。但是当事情牵涉到国家的威信和尊严的时候，那就不是两英里的领土了。这里牵涉到的是国家的尊严和自尊心。因此就发生了这种事情。但是，我不希望——只要我能做到——把这个问题弄到任何一国都别无他法——因为这里牵涉到他们的民族尊严——而只有诉诸武力的地步。这不是我所希望的。……
    拉姆·苏巴格·辛格博士：根据最近的报告，边界是在哪里呢？根据我们从他们那里收到的最近的复照，他们所说的边界是在哪里呢？
    尼赫鲁：没有大地图和关于村庄等等的各种小地图，我怎能说呢？目前关于这个问题的争端是一个比较小的问题；究竟它可能是在这边，还是在那边两英里的地方，这不是一个很大的问题；但是我不知道他们在这里、那里和其他地方的地图如何。就我而论，我常常说，我们从缅甸境边一直到不丹边境的边界是麦克马洪线，我们坚持这条线。
    一位议员：他们是不是……
    尼赫鲁：请让我继续说下去，请不要过分重视报纸上刊登的消息。我就这个问题说的话的权威性要多一些。
    这是麦克马洪线，我们坚持这条线。我们认为，中国政府继续出版一种地图，把东北边境特区的一半、阿萨姆的三分之一和不丹的三分之一画得好像是属于中国的地方，这是非常不相宜的、非常不适当的。这的确是一种冒犯。在一段时间里发生某些事情和某些错误，我是可以理解的；但是一年又一年，一共十年，继续对我们说：“好吧，在我们有空的时候将研究这个问题”，这并不是很好的答复。情况就是这样。
    但是，在大体上接受麦克马洪线之后，我准备讨论对麦克马洪线的任何解释；在这里或那里的次要部分的解释——这是不同的问题——不是这些大块领土，而是次要部分的解释，究竟这个小山是在这里，这块小地方是在那边或这边，都根据事实，根据地图和现有的证据来确定。这是我准备同中国政府讨论的。我准备接受任何和解的、调解的办法来考虑这个问题，我准备在他们或者我们——不管是那一方——提出异议的时候，由双方所同意的权力机构就这些次要的修正进行仲裁。这是一个不同的问题。我这样说是由于我并不采取那种狭隘的态度，认为我说的都是对的，别人说的都是错的。但是必须接受总的麦克马洪线，就我们而论，它是存在的，我们接受它。
    关于拉达克的情况是有些不同的。麦克马洪线并没有伸延到那里。它是受当时的克什米尔统治者古拉布·辛格大君（他是当时旁遮普西赫统治者的封臣）签订的，有一百多年的古老条约所制约的。这是十九世纪三十年代的事。一方面是1842年的条约，另一方面是拉萨的统治者和中国皇帝的代表，结果是拉达克被承认是克什米尔邦的一部分。
    没有人曾对这一点提出异议，现在也没有人对它提出异议，但是拉达克同西藏的边界不是很仔细地划定的。在某种程度上，它为前往那里的英国军官所划定，但是我颇为怀疑他们是否仔细进行过勘察，他们把线划出来了。这条线一直标在我们地图上。他们这样做了。由于那里并没有人居住，因此总的说来，这没有多大关系。它在过去也没有多大关系。当时没有人注意它。
    现在问题产生了。我们准备坐下来讨论这些次要问题。但是根据什么条件来讨论呢？首先是条约、现有的地图等等。其次是惯例，这些年来一直是惯例的那些东西。第三是地理。我所说的地理是指分水线和山脉之类的自然形势而言，而不是指一小块被分割的平原。这些都是定为国际疆界的方便地势。
    在谈到这个涉及比较简单的问题的提案的时候，我特地提到这种种问题。现在回过头来再谈这个提案，且不谈提案人以及某些其他议员对西藏人怀抱的同情，如果我们采取一个行动，这个行动根据在法律上和宪法上都应当是有根据的，我们应当希望它会产生一些结果，产生一些有助于我们实现所谋求的目标的结果。
    从是否有根据的观点来看，联合国可能由于两个理由而参预进来。一个理由是侵犯人权，另一个理由是侵略。可是侵犯人权只适用于那些已经接受联合国宪章的人，换句话说，只适用于那些已经接受宪章的联合国会员国。严格地说，你不能把宪章应用于那些没有接受宪章、没有被允许参加联合国的人。事情就是这样。
    其次，要是你谈到侵略，一个独立的主权国家侵略另一个独立的主权国家的问题；正如我对你们所说过的，就世界事务而论，相当长时间以来，西藏一直没有被承认为独立国家，甚至在这件事情发生以前很久就是如此——更不谈在这件事情发生以后了。因此要解释为侵略是困难的。
    你们可能会说，这些论点是一些颇带法律性质的论点。但是我只不过是指出所牵涉到的任何困难和程序的宪法方面的问题。接着，我要谈一下某个实际的方面。那就是，这样做会有什么好处呢？假定说我们克服了法律上的模棱两可的地方和法律方面的困难。结果可能会在联合国大会或者安全理事会——不管在什么地方提出这个问题——展开辩论，一场激烈的辩论，一场怒气冲冲的辩论，一场按着冷战的方式进行的辩论。在这场辩论进行过以后，这场辩论的发起人和这个动议的发起人将做些什么呢？再没有别的事可以做了。他们将回家去。在把事情搞到更高的温度，搞到高热的程度之后，他们就将回家去。他们已经尽到了他们的责任，因为他们别的什么办法也没有。
    显然，谁也不会派军队到西藏或中国去，因为在匈牙利事件中并没有那样做；匈牙利是欧洲的一部分，同欧洲各国联系较多。如果认为他们会在西藏那样做，那是荒诞的。显然不会那样。因此，将会发生的只是其他某些国家发表一些激烈的意见，加以否认，然后这个问题就发展到冷战的程度——被拉进冷战的领域——并且大概会在中国政府身上引起反作用，而这些反作用对西藏和西藏人民甚至比现在更不利。因此最终的结果对西藏人民并不是什么使人感到宽慰的事情，而是与此相反。
    这个问题无论是从宪法的观点还是从法律的观点来看，都是不明确的。事实上，研究过这个问题的人认为，很难把它提到那里。从实际的观点来看也不会有什么好结果。那么，除了可能是要满足某种表示同情或者表示我们感到愤慨的内心要求以外，把这个问题提出讨论的目的究竟是什么呢？我肯定是能够理解这种内心要求的。但是，我们决不能被这种要求所支配，让它把我们带到无人知道的境地、危险的境地。因此，我不能同意这个提案，并且我要建议人民院也不要同意它。
