(3) During the holidays, all regions, especially large factories, mines, and ports, should prepare sufficient loading, unloading, and handling forces to ensure normal loading, unloading, and handling. From now on, all localities must concentrate on a crash effort to move goods accumulated at stations, ports, and wharves, and quickly clear cargo spaces to ensure unobstructed entry and exit of goods during the festival. Propaganda and mobilization work should be carried out for employees who must persist in transportation work during the holidays, explaining the important significance of completing holiday transportation tasks, and guiding the vast number of employees to celebrate the great 10th anniversary of National Day with practical actions that overfulfill their tasks.
