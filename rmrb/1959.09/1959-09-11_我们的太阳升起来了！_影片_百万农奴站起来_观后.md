    "Our Sun Has Risen!"
    —After Watching the Film "A Million Serfs Stand Up"
    Wang Feng
    The film "A Million Serfs Stand Up," produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, has been released. This is a good film. The facts it reveals, although only a portion of the millions of facts within the reactionary, dark, cruel, and savage serf system of Tibet, leave a profound impression on every viewer and provide them with a good education.

    In this film, people can see what kind of society Tibet, which was embellished in every possible way by foreign ambitionists, actually was; they can see what kind of system the old regime, for which Indian expansionists weep like bereaved parents, actually was. From this film, we can see that in the serf society of the lord's manor, under this inhuman system, the serfs and slaves, who accounted for about 95% of the Tibetan population, endured extremely cruel oppression and exploitation for generations, living a life of sorrow; while the serf owners (i.e., officials, monasteries, and nobles), who accounted for only about 5% of the Tibetan population, used every means to plunder the laboring people's property, living a luxurious and decadent life.

    In March of this year, the rebellion of reactionary forces in Tibet and the failure of this rebellion opened a new page in the history of Tibet.

    Not long ago, I conducted some surveys in Dongga Zong and Cai Zong (Zong is equivalent to a county) in Tibet and held symposiums with Chaba, Duiqiong, and Langsheng. I asked them: Who has been beaten by the lord? Who owes the lord debt? Everyone present answered in unison: Among the old people of Tibet, there is no one who has not been beaten by the lord, and no one who does not owe the lord debt. From this answer, it is clear how serious the disasters and pains brought to the masses by the old system in Tibet were! But on the other hand, it is also clear that the revolutionary struggle of the Tibetan laboring people is developing vigorously. Their call for liberation is so high! Their love for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is so great! Their support for the various policies of the Party and government is so strong! I believe that anyone who sees such a scene will be deeply moved! The suffering masses have begun to realize that the reason for their past poverty is not that their fate is bad, but that the old system in Tibet is bad, and it is the result of the cruel oppression and exploitation of the three major lords; they said, "In the past, the sun only shone on the nobles, but the sun of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao shines on our people. Now, the sun of the nobles has set, and our sun has risen."

    Just as the film shows, a million serfs have stood up, smiling and straightening their chests! It is precisely because the exploitation and oppression of the feudal serf system were extremely cruel that the serfs' desire for liberation became more and more urgent. At present, the democratic reform movement has been launched throughout the region, and the masses' fighting and production enthusiasm are very high. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, they have full confidence and determination to carry out the democratic reform in Tibet to the end and resolutely fight for the construction of a democratic and socialist new Tibet. The people's sun has risen on the Tibetan plateau and will never set.

    Let all imperialists, foreign interveners, and all rebellious elements and reactionary upper strata feel uncomfortable and even curse endlessly, Tibet will never belong to them! The future of Tibet is bright and happy. The Tibetan people who have stood up, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will build their happy homeland together with all the brothers and sisters in the big family. Just as the film ends, "The dark and cruel old Tibet is dying; the bright, progressive, and happy new Tibet is being born!"

    We cheer for the serfs who have stood up! We cheer for the rebirth of Tibet!

    “我们的太阳升起来了！”
    ——影片“百万农奴站起来”观后
    汪锋
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂拍摄的影片“百万农奴站起来”已经上演了。这是一部好的影片。它揭露的事实，虽然只是西藏反动、黑暗、残酷、野蛮的农奴制度中千百万事实的一部分，但是，它给每个观众留下的印象是深刻的，使每个观众都受到一次很好的教育。
    人们在这部影片里，可以看到曾被外国野心分子百般美化的西藏社会，究竟是一个什么样的社会；可以看到被印度扩张主义分子如丧考妣地哭泣过的旧制度，究竟是一个什么样的制度。我们从这部影片里，可以看到在领主庄园制的农奴社会里，在这种惨无人道的制度下，占西藏人口95％左右的农奴和奴隶，世世代代地忍受着极端残酷的压迫和剥削，过着悲痛的生活；而那些只占西藏人口5％左右的农奴主（即官家、寺院和贵族），他们用尽一切办法，把劳动人民的财物搜刮得干干净净，过着奢侈豪华的糜烂生活。
    今年3月，西藏反动势力的叛乱和这个叛乱的失败，使西藏的历史展开了新的一页。
    不久以前，我曾在西藏的东噶宗、蔡宗（宗相当于县）作过些调查，并且召开过有差巴、堆穷、朗生参加的座谈会。我曾问过他们：有谁挨过领主的打？有谁欠领主的债？到会的人都异口同声地说：西藏的老百姓，没有一个不挨领主的打，没有一个不欠领主的债的。从这个回答中可以清楚地看出，西藏的旧制度给群众带来的灾难痛苦是何等的严重！但是，另一方面，也清楚地看到了西藏劳动人民的革命斗争，正在轰轰烈烈地开展着。他们要求解放的呼声是那样的高涨！他们对于党中央、毛主席是那样的热爱！他们对于党和政府当前的多项政策是那样的拥护！我相信，任何人看到那种情景都会深受感动！劳苦的群众已经开始认识到过去贫困的原因，并不是什么自己的命运不好，而是西藏的旧制度不好，是三大领主残酷压迫剥削的结果；他们说，“过去的太阳只照在贵族的身上，共产党、毛主席的太阳才照在我们人民的身上。现在，贵族的太阳下山了，我们的太阳升起来了”。
    正像影片所表现的，百万农奴站起来了，欢笑着挺直了胸身站起来了！正是由于封建农奴制度的剥削压迫残酷至极，因而农奴要求解放的心情也愈益迫切。目前，民主改革运动已经在全区开展起来，群众的斗争和生产情绪都非常高涨，在党和政府的领导下，他们有充分的信心和决心，把西藏的民主改革进行到底，并且为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而坚决奋斗。人民的太阳在西藏高原上升起来了，永远不会落了。
    让一切帝国主义者、外国干涉者和一切叛乱分子、反动上层心里不痛快，以至咒骂不休吧，西藏永远不属于他们的了！西藏的前途是光明的、幸福的。站起来了的西藏人民，在中国共产党的领导下，将跟大家庭里的所有弟兄们一起，建设自己的幸福家园。正如影片结束时所描述的：“黑暗的、残酷的旧西藏正在死亡；光明的、进步的、幸福的新西藏正在诞生！”
    我们为站起来的农奴欢呼！为西藏的新生欢呼！
