Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 27th: A mass meeting was held in Carnegie Hall, New York, on September 25th to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party USA. The National Secretary of the Communist Party USA, Dennis, and the Chairman of the New York organization of the Communist Party USA, Davis, delivered speeches at the mass meeting. A letter written by the Honorary Chairman of the Communist Party USA, Foster, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Party was also read at the meeting.

In his speech, Dennis emphasized: "Tonight, the American people and all mankind are turning their deepest hopes to Camp David, where President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev are discussing the most important issues in the world and possible ways to end the Cold War."

Dennis said that Khrushchev's and Eisenhower's historic mutual visits, and the world factors leading to the mutual visits, are victories for the idea and policy of peaceful coexistence. They signify the complete bankruptcy of the brink-of-war policy pursued by Dulles and Truman. They prove once again that, under the current new international conditions, it is possible to prevent the outbreak of a third world war and nuclear catastrophe. Dennis said: "The encouraging, wise, and far-sighted proposals put forward by Premier Khrushchev in his speeches during his visit to our country—complete and thorough disarmament, extensive trade between East and West, peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition, and the banning of nuclear tests—have aroused enthusiastic responses in the minds of the American people and all mankind, and have pointed the way to safeguarding world peace. Khrushchev's visit and President Eisenhower's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union will further melt the ice of the Cold War."

Dennis said that American Communists will fight together with all progressive and democratic forces to bury the hydrogen bomb and ensure world peace.

The Honorary Chairman of the Communist Party USA, Foster, wrote in his letter, "Now socialism is achieving the fastest progress in history, striving for worldwide influence and power at a tremendous pace. The best reception the Americans gave to Premier Khrushchev proves this. One socialist country after another is overtaking capitalist countries in industrial development and other fields. Socialism is advancing at an unprecedented speed, attracting the whole world to its side."

    美共庆祝建党四十周年
    丹尼斯说苏美首脑互访是和平共处的胜利
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：为了庆祝美国共产党成立四十周年，9月25日在纽约卡内基音乐厅内举行了群众大会。美国共产党全国委员会书记丹尼斯和美国共产党纽约组织的主席戴维斯等在群众大会上发表了讲话。会上还宣读了美国共产党名誉主席福斯特为庆祝建党四十周年而写的信。
    丹尼斯在讲话中强调说：“今天晚上美国人民和全人类都把内心最深切的希望转向戴维营，在那里，艾森豪威尔总统和赫鲁晓夫总理正在讨论世界上最重大的问题和停止冷战的可能方法。”
    丹尼斯说，赫鲁晓夫同艾森豪威尔具有历史意义的互相访问，和导致互相访问的世界因素都是和平共处的思想和政策的胜利。它们意味着杜勒斯和杜鲁门所执行的战争边缘政策完全破产。它们再一次证明，在目前新的国际条件下，有可能防止爆发第三次世界大战和原子灾难。丹尼斯说：“赫鲁晓夫总理在来我国访问时发表的各次演说中所提出的令人鼓舞的、明智的和具有远见的建议——全面彻底裁军、东西方之间广泛进行贸易来往、和平共处和和平竞赛、禁止核试验——在美国人民和全人类的心目中引起了热烈的反应，给保卫全世界和平指出了道路。赫鲁晓夫的访问和艾森豪威尔总统即将去苏联的访问将能使冷战的冰层更多地融化”。
    丹尼斯说，美国共产党人将和一切进步的和民主的力量共同奋斗，争取埋葬氢弹并使全世界和平得到保障。
    美国共产党名誉主席福斯特在他的信中写道，“现在社会主义正在实现历史上最快的进步，以巨大的步伐去争取全世界的影响和威力。美国人给予赫鲁晓夫总理最好的接待就证明了这一点。社会主义国家一个接着一个地在工业发展和其他各方面赶过资本主义国家。社会主义正在以空前的速度前进，把全世界吸引到自己这方面来”。
