Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, September 5th. After the publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Yugoslav News Agency and newspapers published a series of articles and commentaries. The common characteristic of these articles and commentaries is: distorting facts and wantonly slandering.

The "Liberation Daily" on August 30th published a dispatch from the Yugoslav News Agency correspondent in Beijing, distorting the content of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session, claiming that "dominating" in the documents was "acknowledging one's own shortcomings and mistakes." He slandered that China "had major mistakes last year," and said that "these mistakes made many difficulties this year greater than under normal circumstances." This reporter, completely ignoring the fact that the broad masses of the Chinese people were full of confidence and enthusiastically responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party to launch a movement to increase production and practice thrift, actually said that after the publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session, "the most common initial impression was a feeling of surprise, unexpectedness, and bewilderment."

The "Politika" published on August 30th a special article from the Yugoslav News Agency correspondent in Beijing, even saying that "negative psychology is one of the characteristics of the Eighth Plenary Session." This reporter could not deny that China's economic measures were realistic and pragmatic, but he used clumsy methods to deceive his readers, saying that "China's economic measures and practical steps are greatly closer to the earth," while "political slogans continue to remain in the high sky." He also said that "there are certain differences between the economic line and the political line" of the Eighth Plenary Session, and slandered that "politicians" are "still not prepared to yield to the necessity pointed out by the economy and practice." This reporter concealed the true situation of the Chinese people's commune movement from his readers. He described the communes "initially conceived and established" in China as communes "putting even small stoves into the property of the whole people," but then he said that this kind of commune "has disappeared without a trace." This Yugoslav "reporter" is worthy of being a "prolific writer" in fabricating rumors. The same day, the "Liberation Daily" also published another "special article" of his, exaggerating the slightly tense supply of a small number of commodities in the Chinese market in the first half of this year into "universal and significant poverty in the market, difficulties in supply, and chaos in the exchange between various economic departments and strata."

The tone and wording of these Yugoslav newspapers in attacking and slandering China's socialist construction are exactly the same as those of the reactionary Western imperialists. They especially attacked the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement. The "Borba" published on August 30th a dispatch from its reporter in Beijing, spreading rumors that the people's commune and the Great Leap Forward "led to... a decline in labor enthusiasm, a reduction in production," and "the communes conceived and organized for 500 million farmers did not provide the expected results." It said, "Farmers in the commune began to lose interest in increasing production." It vilified China's economic policy as "a long-term policy of constantly tightening the belt." The "Komunist" weekly's editorial on September 3rd slandered that the adjustment of this year's production plan "obviously means a huge practical change in the communization movement and the Great Leap Forward movement," and "constantly tightening the belt will sooner or later have an adverse effect on production and cause serious economic chaos." The editorial also insisted that some shortcomings caused by China's lack of experience in agricultural estimation last year were "the result of established political and economic policies."

More than a year ago, Yugoslav newspapers began to viciously attack China's general line, Great Leap Forward, and people's commune movement. Yugoslav revisionists are extremely hostile to the leap-forward development of China's socialist construction. According to incomplete statistics, from July last year to mid-August this year, the main Yugoslav newspapers published no less than one hundred articles, commentaries, dispatches, etc. related to this aspect. These articles, commentaries, and dispatches vilified the general line, which embodies the Chinese people's firm will to change the backward state of the country as soon as possible, as "inhuman bureaucracy, a line of state centralism," and as "a bureaucratic revision of Marxism in practice and theory." They vilified the people's commune movement, which reflects the Chinese peasants' consciousness and vital interests and is enthusiastically supported by the masses, as "an act of terror" taken by the state against the peasants. They echoed Dulles and his like, slandering the soaring enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward as "forced labor," "inhuman life," and turning people into "machines."

However, the hatred of the Yugoslav revisionists, cloaked in Marxism, for the great achievements of China's socialist construction only exposes once again that they are completely jackals of the same lair as the reactionary imperialists who are hostile to the Chinese people.

### 在诽谤我国的合唱中大卖力气  南斯拉夫报刊使尽诬蔑的看家本领

    在诽谤我国的合唱中大卖力气
    南斯拉夫报刊使尽诬蔑的看家本领
    新华社5日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：在中共八届八中全会公报和决议发表以后，南斯拉夫通讯社和报刊连续发表了一系列的文章和评论。这些文章和评论的共同特点是：歪曲事实和肆意诽谤。
    8月30日“解放报”刊登的南斯拉夫通讯社驻北京记者的一篇通讯，歪曲八中全会文件的内容，说什么文件中“占统治地位的”是“承认自己的缺点和错误”。他诬蔑中国“去年有过重大的错误”，并说“这些错误使今年的许多困难变得比在正常情况下更大”。这位记者完全不顾中国广大人民满怀信心，热烈响应党的八中全会号召展开增产节约运动的事实，竟说在八中全会文件公布后，“最普遍的初步印象是交织着惊奇、出乎意料和惶惑的感情”。
    8月30日的“政治报”发表南斯拉夫通讯社驻北京记者的专稿中，竟说“消极心理是八中全会的特点之一”。这位记者无法否认中国经济措施是实事求是的，但是他却使用了拙劣的手法来欺骗他的读者，说什么“中国的经济措施和实际步骤大大地接近地球”，而“政治口号继续保留在高空”。他还说八中全会的“经济路线和政治路线之间存在着某些分歧”，并且诽谤
  “政治家”对于“屈服于经济和实践所指出的必要性还缺乏准备”。这位记者向他的读者隐瞒中国人民公社运动的真实情况，他把中国“最初阶段所设想和所建立的”公社说成是“把小炉灶都列入全民财产的”公社，但是他接着又说这种公社“已经无影无踪”。这位南斯拉夫“记者”在制造谣言方面不愧为一位“多产作家”。同一日的“解放报”也发表了他的又一篇“专稿”，把今年上半年中国市场上一小部分商品的供应曾经有些紧张的情况，夸大为“市场上的普遍而显著的贫乏，供应上的困难以及各经济部门和各阶层之间交换的混乱”。
    南斯拉夫这些报刊攻击和诽谤中国社会主义建设的腔调、用语完全同西方帝国主义反动派一模一样。它们特别攻击了大跃进和人民公社化运动。“战斗报”在8月30日发表它驻北京记者的一篇通讯中造谣说人民公社化和大跃进“导致了……劳动热情的下降、生产的降低”，“给五亿农民所设想、所组织的公社没有提供预期的成果”。它说，“在公社内的农民开始失去对增加生产的兴趣。”它把中国的经济政策污蔑成为“不断束紧腰带的长期政策”。“共产主义者”周报9月3日的社论诽谤今年生产计划的调整“显然意味着公社化运动和大跃进运动的巨大的实际改变”，“不断的勒紧腰带早晚要对生产造成不良影响，并造成严重的经济混乱”。社论还把去年中国在农业估算中由于缺乏经验而造成的某些缺点，硬说成是“既定的政治经济方针的结果”。
    一年多以前，南斯拉夫的报刊就开始对中国总路线、大跃进和人民公社化运动进行恶毒攻击。南斯拉夫修正主义者极端仇视中国社会主义建设的飞跃发展。据不完全的统计，从去年7月份到今年8月中旬，南斯拉夫主要报刊所发表的有关这方面的文章、评论、通讯等就不下一百篇。这些文章、评论、通讯，把体现中国人民要求尽快地改变国家落后状况的坚定意志的总路线，诬蔑为“非人道的官僚主义，国家集权主义的路线”，是“对马克思主义的重大实践和理论的官僚主义的修正”。它们把反映中国农民的觉悟和切身利益并得到群众热烈拥护的人民公社化运动，诬蔑成国家对农民采取的“一种恐怖行动”。它们同杜勒斯之流一唱一和，诽谤中国人民在大跃进中所表现出来的冲天干劲是“强迫劳动”、是“非人的生活”、是在把人变成“机器”。
    但是，披着马克思主义外衣的南斯拉夫修正主义者对中国社会主义建设巨大成就的仇视，只是再次暴露他们同敌视中国人民的帝国主义反动派完全是一丘之貉。
