Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The first stage of the First National Games football finals concluded today after six intense matches, with the group stage round robin completed. Hebei, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), Guangdong, Liaoning, Beijing, and Shaanxi teams have qualified to compete for the top six spots in the second stage finals. The second stage round robin will be held in Beijing from September 10th to 27th. The other six teams—Jilin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shanghai, Hubei, and Jiangsu—will also hold a round robin in Beijing during the same period to compete for seventh to twelfth place.

Today's matches were decisive for each team's chances of competing for the top six spots, making the competition on the field extremely tense and fierce.

The day's matches again saw some unexpected results. In Group Three in Tianjin, Shaanxi, which had finished third in the Taiyuan competition zone during the preliminary rounds, defeated Hubei, the champion of the Zhengzhou competition zone during the preliminary rounds, by a score of 2-0, securing second place in the group with two wins and one loss. Beijing defeated Jiangsu by a score of 1-0 today, also with a record of two wins and one loss, but they won the group championship because they had previously defeated Shaanxi 1-0.

In Group Two in Tianjin, Sichuan, which had lost to Guangdong 0-4 in the zonal preliminary rounds, defeated Guangdong today by a score of 3-0, a team that had recently won consecutive victories against the strong teams of Liaoning and Shanghai. As a result, Sichuan and Liaoning both had a record of one win, one loss, and one draw in the first stage of the finals, with equal points; however, because Sichuan had previously lost to Liaoning 1-3, they were ranked third in the group and failed to enter the competition for the top six spots. Despite the loss, Guangdong was the only team in the group to win two consecutive matches, securing first place in the group with the most points.

The results of the matches in Group One in Beijing today were: Hebei defeated their final opponent, Heilongjiang, by a score of 3-0, securing first place with two wins and one draw; the PLA team defeated Jilin by a score of 2-1, also with a record of two wins and one draw, but ranked second due to fewer net goals.

The intense match between Sichuan and Guangdong was the most noteworthy. Sichuan studied and mastered the characteristics of Guangdong, which had maintained an undefeated record of seven wins in seven matches since the zonal preliminary rounds this year. From the kickoff, Sichuan adopted a strategy of offense as defense, pushing their defensive line into the opponent's half and combining it with sudden attacks, leading 1-0 in the first half. Shortly after the second half kickoff, Sichuan launched another quick attack, with the fast-running left forward Zheng Yongxiu and right winger Gong Jinyuan passing to each other, driving straight into the opponent's penalty area and scoring two consecutive goals, creating a final advantage of 3-0.

The match between Shaanxi and Hubei was also very tense. The Shaanxi team, with an average age of twenty-two, also adopted a tactic of offense as defense, launching a fierce attack on the Hubei team. Thirteen minutes into the match, Shaanxi center forward Wang Zufou received a pass from midfield, dribbled the ball forward from the center, and took a powerful shot while the Hubei defenders and goalkeeper were not yet in position, opening the scoring. Less than two minutes after the kickoff by the Hubei midfield, Shaanxi left inside forward Liu Renzhi intercepted the ball and passed it long to center forward Wang Zufou, who skillfully dodged the opponent's defender and gently pushed the ball to the right. At this moment, right winger Miao Jicheng, who was at the opponent's goal twenty meters away, caught up and scored another goal, ending the first half with a score of 2-0. In the second half, the Hubei team launched an all-out counterattack, with numerous dangerous situations in front of the Shaanxi goal. However, because the Hubei team was too eager to win and played too hastily, coupled with the Shaanxi team's tight defense, they were unable to score.

    足球决赛第一阶段比赛结束
    河北　解放军　广东  辽宁　北京　陕西将争前六名名次
    新华社7日讯　第一届全国运动会足球决赛在今天以六场激战后，结束了第一阶段的分组循环赛。河北、解放军、广东、辽宁、北京和陕西队获得了在第二阶段决赛中争夺前六名名次的比赛权。第二阶段循环赛将从9月10日到27日集中在北京举行。另六个队——吉林、黑龙江、四川、上海、湖北、江苏队同一时期也将在北京举行循环赛，争夺第七到第十二名名次。
    今天的比赛是各代表队能不能得到争夺前六名名次比赛权的决定性关头，因此，球场上的竞争十分紧张热烈。
    在今天的比赛中，又出现了出人意料的战果。在天津的第三组中，预赛时获得太原竞赛区第三名的陕西队，以二比零打败了预赛时郑州竞赛区的冠军湖北队，以二胜一负的战绩取得了小组第二名。北京队今天以一比零胜江苏队，战绩也是二胜一负，但他们曾以一比零胜陕西队，得小组冠军。
    在天津的第二组中，分区预赛时曾以零比四败给广东队的四川队，今天以三比零的优势战胜了最近连胜辽宁、上海两支劲旅的广东队。至此，四川队在决赛第一阶段和辽宁队一样，虽然都是一胜一负一平，积分相等；但是，由于他们曾经以一比三败给辽宁队，所以在这一组中名列第三，没能进入争夺前六名的行列。广东队虽败，但他们是这个组唯一连胜两场的队，以积分最多取得了小组第一名。
    今天在北京第一组的比赛结果是：河北队以三比零战胜了最后一个对手——黑龙江队，以二胜一平的战绩得第一名；解放军队以二比一胜吉林队，战绩也是二胜一平，但净胜球少，名列第二。
    四川对广东一场激战是最引人注意的。四川队研究和掌握了从今年分区预赛以来七战七捷、一直保持不败纪录的广东队的特点，在开球后就采取以攻为守的策略，把防卫线推到对方半场，并结合突击进攻，上半场以一比零领先。下半场开球不久，四川队又采取快攻，奔跑迅速的左前卫郑永修和右边锋龚锦源相互传递，长驱直入对方禁区，连续攻进两球，造成了最后的三比零的优势。
    陕西胜湖北的一场也很紧张。队员平均年龄二十二岁的陕西队，也采取了以攻为守的战术向湖北队展开猛攻。比赛到十三分钟时，陕西队中锋王祖阜接到中场传来的球，带球从中路前进，乘湖北队后卫和守门员还没站稳阵脚，大脚猛射，首开纪录。湖北队中场开球后不到两分钟，陕西队左内锋刘仁治截得球后，长传给中锋王祖阜，王祖阜巧妙地闪过对方后卫的阻击，将球轻轻向右一拨，这时在对方球门二十米处的右边锋苗继成赶上一脚，又进一球，上半场以二比零结束。下半场湖北队全力反攻，陕西队门前险象丛生，但由于湖北队求胜心切，踢得比较急躁，再加上陕西队防守严密，所以始终没有建树。
