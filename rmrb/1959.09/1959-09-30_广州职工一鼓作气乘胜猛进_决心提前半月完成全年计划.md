Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 29th. Building on the comprehensive leap forward in industrial production in August and September, Guangzhou has decided to forge ahead with redoubled efforts and strive to fulfill this year's production plan fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule.

Since the publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee, workers on Guangzhou's industrial front have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and a vigorous mass movement has taken shape during the great battles of August and September. The total output value for the entire month of August increased by more than one-third compared to July, the first ten days of September increased by 40% compared to the same period in August, and the second ten days of September increased by more than 30% compared to the first ten days of September. More than 450 factories have already completed their third quarter plans about a week ahead of schedule. In terms of capital construction, more than 30 of the 53 key projects arranged by the province and city have been basically completed after 40 days of hard work. It is estimated that by the end of September, the city will have completed 73% of the annual capital construction plan. Significant achievements have also been made in improving quality, labor productivity, safety, and conserving raw materials.

In response to this situation, Guangzhou's industrial leadership departments promptly seized the current favorable situation and issued the fourth quarter production plan as early as late September. According to this plan, the output of major industrial products will increase significantly compared to the third quarter, and many products can be completed ahead of schedule one after another; the annual total industrial output value plan can be completed fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule.

Currently, factories and enterprises have mobilized the masses to thoroughly discuss the fourth quarter production plan and put forward specific measures to actively prepare for work. The workers are full of confidence and determined to put in greater effort and enthusiasm to strive to complete the annual production plan fifteen to twenty days ahead of schedule.

    广州职工一鼓作气乘胜猛进
    决心提前半月完成全年计划
    据新华社广州29日电　广州市在取得8、9月份工业生产全面跃进的基础上，决定一鼓作气，乘胜猛进，力争提前十五天到二十天完成今年生产计划。
    自从党的八中全会的公报和决议公布以后，广州市工业战线职工热烈响应了党中央和毛主席的号召，在大战8、9月中，已经形成一个蓬蓬勃勃的群众性运动。8月全月的总产值，比7月增长三分之一强，9月上旬比8月同期增长四成，9月中旬又比9月上旬增加30％多，并且已有四百五十多个工厂提前一个星期左右完成了第三季度计划。在基本建设方面，省、市安排的五十三个重点项目中，经过四十天的苦战，已有三十多项基本完成，预计到9月底全市将完成全年基建计划的73％。在提高质量和劳动生产率，以及安全和节约原材料等方面，也取得了很大的成绩。
    针对这个情况，广州市工业领导部门及时抓住当前有利形势，早在9月下旬就下达了第四季度生产计划。按照这个计划，主要的工业产品产量比第三季度有很大增长，并且有不少产品可先后提前完成年度计划；全年的工业总产值计划，可以提前十五至二十天完成。
    现在，各工厂企业已发动群众深入讨论第四季度生产计划，并且提出具体措施，积极做好准备工作。职工们都满怀信心，决心拿出更大的干劲和钻劲，力争实现提前十五至二十天完成全年生产计划。
