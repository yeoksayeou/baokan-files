Xinhua News Agency, London, September 11th: The British Conservative Party's organ, the "Daily Telegraph," published an editorial on the 10th regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru. While acknowledging that the letter was persuasive, it continued to engage in malicious slander against China, attempting to negate the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the Sino-Indian border issue, in an effort to provoke relations between India and China.

Premier Zhou Enlai's letter pointed out that in dealing with the Sino-Indian border issue, one must first consider the historical background of British aggression against China during its rule over India. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office denied this historical fact on the 9th, saying that he "denies that Britain ever invaded China during British rule in India."

However, the "Daily Telegraph" on the 10th admitted that "after reading the long and detailed argumentation in which China claims adjustments to its borders with India, it is difficult not to feel its overall persuasiveness." "The argument says that India's borders were delineated by British imperialists at a time when China itself was a victim of Western imperialist aggression." The "Daily Telegraph" acknowledged that this "form of political division" was "imposed by Western countries." However, this editorial also absurdly slandered the letter's "specific demands as aggressive and intolerable," saying that "communism is often naked imperialism." The editorial described the illegal border unilaterally and forcibly drawn by British imperialism in the past as "the only legal basis for peaceful arbitration," and it wrote, "By condemning Western imperialism, it implicitly rejects the only legal basis for peaceful arbitration." "It is difficult to imagine how this (Sino-Indian border) dispute can be resolved peacefully." On the same day, the "Daily Telegraph" also published a report, continuing to maliciously spread rumors that had long been exposed, saying that Chinese troops were gathering on the Sikkim and Bhutan borders, "forming a threat of invasion."

Commenting on Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru, "The Scotsman" pointed out that after the letter made accusations of aggression by Indian troops, it "suggested negotiations on the location of the border." The letter also mentioned China's willingness to coexist peacefully with Sikkim and Bhutan, which is "a very welcome approach." The newspaper wrote that Nehru received the response: "A new opportunity for peace and a powerful indication that China is as willing to coexist as India."

The "Irish Times" editorial on the 10th, while saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's letter had some "unconciliatory" aspects, also admitted: "Mr. Zhou Enlai's letter to Mr. Nehru at least indicates the possibility of a temporary solution to the fighting on the northeastern border of India. The Communist Chinese Premier suggested that the dispute be resolved through negotiations, before which the status quo should be maintained and force should be abandoned."

### 英国“每日电讯报”继续摇唇鼓舌  恶毒诽谤我国　挑拨中印关系

    英国“每日电讯报”继续摇唇鼓舌
    恶毒诽谤我国　挑拨中印关系
    新华社11日讯　伦敦消息：英国保守党机关报“每日电讯报”10日就周恩来总理给尼赫鲁总理的信发表社论，一面承认这封信很有说服力，一面又继续对中国进行恶毒的诬蔑，企图否定和平解决中印边界问题的可能性，以竭力挑拨印度同中国的关系。
    周恩来总理的信里指出，处理中印边界问题时，不能不首先考虑到英国在统治印度的时候对中国进行侵略的历史背景。英国外交部发言人在9日抵赖这个历史事实，他说他“否认在印度受英国统治期间英国曾侵略过中国”。
    但是，10日的“每日电讯报”承认，“读了中国主张调整它同印度之间的边界的那长篇大论细致详尽的论证以后，很难不感受到它那种总括的说服力。”“论证中说，印度的边界是英帝国主义者在中国本身尚是西方帝国主义侵略下的牺牲者的日子里凭武力划定的”。“每日电讯报”承认，这种“政治划分形式”是“西方国家所强加的”。但是，这篇社论同时却又荒唐地诬蔑信中“提出的那些具体要求是侵略性的，不可容忍的”，说什么“共产主义往往是赤裸裸的帝国主义”。社论把英帝国主义过去片面强行划出的非法界线说成是“和平仲裁的唯一的法律基础”，它还写道，“由于谴责了西方帝国主义，就是隐含地拒绝了和平仲裁的唯一的法律基础”。“很难设想这种（中印边界）争端如何能和平解决”。同一天“每日电讯报”还刊载了一篇报道，继续恶意散布早已揭穿了的谣言，说什么中国军队在锡金和不丹边境集结，“形成侵入的威胁”。
    “苏格兰人报”在评论周恩来总理给尼赫鲁总理的信时指出，信中提出对印度军队侵略的指责以后，“建议就边界的位置问题举行谈判”。信里还谈到中国愿意同锡金和不丹友好相处的问题，这是“十分受欢迎的方式”。这家报纸写道，尼赫鲁得到的回答是：“和平的新机会以及有一个说明中国同印度一样愿意共处的有力的迹象”。
    “爱尔兰时报”10日的社论一面说周恩来总理的信里有些“不是和解的”方面，一面也承认：“周恩来先生给尼赫鲁先生的信件至少表示有暂时解决印度东北边境上的战斗的可能性。共产党中国总理建议用谈判来解决争端，在这以前，要维持现状和放弃使用武力。”
