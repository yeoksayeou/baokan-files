    Level-by-Level Model Soldiers, Everyone Exerts Effort, Teams Compete to Surpass Production:
    Leyuan Brigade, Backward Units Catch Up with Advanced Units

    (Our Report) How to mobilize the masses to carry out production competitions in areas with backward production? Leyuan Brigade of Caowei Commune in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, adopted the method of finding advanced figures from backward teams, establishing model soldiers by category, and planting red flags at all levels, which yielded good results in carrying out grassroots production competition movements between individuals and work groups. Now, the attendance rate of the entire team has increased by 17% compared to before the competition. In more than ten days, more than two thousand male and female commune members have accumulated more than 700,000 dan of fertilizer, and inter-tillage and topdressing have upgraded 400 mu of late rice from third-class seedlings, and used local pesticides to kill pests in more than 3,000 mu of late rice fields. Now, the late rice is lush and green, and the jute is more than one person tall, with a bumper harvest in sight. During the competition, the entire team established thirty-eight production "model soldiers" at all levels, classified by gender and age. In the movement of "learning from model soldiers, catching up with model soldiers," 173 "five-good" commune members were also selected. A lively and vigorous political situation of "everyone feeling happy and striving to be upstream" has emerged in the entire team.
    The production competition movement here was recently launched and deepened step by step on the basis of studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and repeatedly criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas. This production brigade has more land and fewer people, insufficient labor, and a poor work foundation in the past, so it has always been a third-class area in terms of production. This year, more than 4,000 mu of paddy fields were converted into dry land, and some newly expanded economic crops such as jute did not grow well enough, causing some cadres and the masses to have a negative and pessimistic attitude, believing that production could not be improved. Not long ago, the Party Committee of the Commune assigned a Party Committee Secretary to serve concurrently as the Party Branch Secretary of the Brigade, and dispatched a group of cadres to strengthen the leadership of the backward production teams.
    First of all, the Party Branch combined the criticism of right-leaning conservative ideas and adopted a comparison and summary approach to affirm the achievements, point out the shortcomings, and encourage everyone's confidence in winning a bumper harvest throughout the year. Ai Youyun, the Party Branch Secretary of the Second Production Team, has devoted himself to leading production and has already earned more than 1,500 work points this year, leading the commune members to do a good job in production and winning the mobile competition red flag five times in a row. However, the First Production Team, with similar production conditions, only harvested 286 jin of rice per mu in the early rice harvest and more than half of the jute were third-class seedlings due to the cadres' lack of in-depth work. The Brigade Party Branch held on-site meetings in these two production teams, mobilizing cadres above the level of work group leader of the entire brigade to compare and analyze the reasons for the good and bad production of these two production teams, so that everyone realized that the primary key to doing a good job in production lies in in-depth leadership and mobilizing the masses. It reversed the erroneous view of a few cadres that "this is an old third-class team and production cannot be improved." On this basis, a work competition movement of "learning from Ai Youyun and catching up with Ai Youyun" was launched among all cadres.
    Finding advanced figures in backward teams, planting red flags, establishing model soldiers, and carrying out production competitions between individuals and work groups is an important link in sweeping away the atmosphere of stagnation, boosting confidence, overcoming difficulties, and quickly changing the backward state of production. For example, in the Fifth Production Team, the original production base was the worst, and a few commune members carried the burden of backwardness, and their enthusiasm for production was not high. The Party Branch of the production team found that poor peasant commune member Gao Changsheng had done 2,000 work points this year, one-third more than the average commune member, and he cared about production and loved the commune as his home, so it mobilized all commune members to compare themselves and learn from Gao Changsheng's advanced deeds, and launched a movement of "learning from Gao Changsheng and catching up with Gao Changsheng" in the entire team. The commune members saw that Gao Changsheng, an honest man who begged for food and worked as a farmhand in the old society, worked silently every day and was praised by the brigade, and everyone felt that they had a future. The number of workers in the whole team quickly increased from more than 60 to more than 80. In five days, the 40 mu of third-class seedlings of late rice in the whole team were given a rush of topdressing, and all the late rice fields were treated for pests. In the recent evaluation competition, they won the red flag.
    During the competition, model soldiers were established in each production team, regardless of cadres, youth, the elderly, and women, and competitions were carried out. This small-scale competition method, specific to individuals, not only made it easier for everyone to learn from each other and progress together because they worked together and saw each other, but also made it easier to help each other. The Second Production Team and the First Production Team were separated by only a small river and carried out production competitions side by side. The Second Production Team was an advanced team and had always been doing well in production. After completing the inter-tillage and weeding work for jute ahead of schedule, they sent more than 40 people to actively help the First Production Team, so that the third-class seedlings of jute in the First Team were quickly eliminated. This communist style of advanced helping backward was commended by the Brigade General Branch, which then launched a movement of advanced helping backward among the commune members of the Second Production Team. Communist Youth League member Zhou Tianbao is a "five-good" commune member. He and young commune member Wen Guofa launched a fertilizer accumulation competition, aiming to accumulate 750 dan of fertilizer each within five days. Zhou Tianbao completed the competition conditions in four days. Wen Guofa was still 350 dan short of the task on the last day of the competition and was in a low mood. Zhou Tianbao took the initiative to help him complete the fertilizer accumulation task that night, which deeply moved Wen Guofa and boosted his enthusiasm for production, accumulating more than 100 dan of fertilizer per day, with very good quality. The Brigade Party Branch commended Zhou Tianbao's deeds of helping backward and Wen Guofa's transformation from backward to advanced. As a result, the production competition climax of "backward catching up with advanced, advanced helping backward" in the entire brigade was carried out more widely and deeply.

    层层树标兵　人人鼓干劲　队队争超产
    乐园大队落后单位赶上先进
    本报讯　在生产落后地区如何发动群众开展生产竞赛？湖南省沅江县草尾公社乐园大队采取从落后队中找先进人物、分类树标兵、层层插红旗的办法，开展人与人、作业组与作业组间的基层生产竞赛运动，收效很好。现在，全队出勤率比竞赛前增加了17％。两千多名男女社员在十多天中，积肥七十多万担，中耕追肥使四百亩晚稻三类苗升了级，并在三千多亩晚稻田里用土农药扑杀了虫害。现在，晚稻青葱满田垅，黄麻长得一人多高，丰收在望。在竞赛中，全队按性别年龄分类，层层树立生产“标兵”三十八名。在“学标兵、赶标兵”的运动中，又评选出“五好”社员一百七十三名。全队已出现了一个“人人心情舒畅，个个力争上游”的生动活泼的政治局面。
    这里的生产竞赛运动，是在最近通过学习党的八届八中全会文件、反复批判右倾保守思想的基础上逐步深入开展起来的。这个生产大队田多人少，劳力不足，过去工作基础也不好，因此在生产上一直是三类型地区。今年有四千多亩稻田改旱土，有些新扩种的黄麻等经济作物生长不够好，使部分干部和群众产生一种消极悲观情绪，认为生产无法搞好。不久前，公社党委会下放一位党委书记到这里兼大队党总支书记，并加派一批干部，加强了对生产后进队的领导。
    首先，党总支结合批判右倾保守思想，采取对比总结方式，肯定成绩，指出缺点，鼓舞大家夺取全年大丰收的信心。第二生产队党支部书记艾幼云深入领导生产，今年已做了一千五百多个劳动工分，带动社员们搞好了生产，连续五次夺取流动竞赛红旗。可是，和他们生产条件差不多的第一生产队由于干部工作不深入，结果早稻每亩只收二百八十六斤谷，黄麻三类苗占一半以上。大队党总支在这两个生产队召开了现场会，发动全大队作业组长以上的干部，对比分析这两个生产队的生产一好一坏的原因，使大家认识到搞好生产的首要关键在领导深入，发动群众。扭转了少数干部认为“这里是老三类队、生产无法搞好”的错误看法。在这个基础上，全体干部中掀起了“学艾幼云、赶艾幼云”的工作竞赛运动。
    在后进队中找先进人物，插红旗、树标兵，开展人与人、作业组与作业组之间的生产竞赛，这是横扫暮气、鼓舞信心、战胜困难、迅速改变生产落后面貌的重要一环。例如第五生产队由于原来生产基础最差，有少数社员背了落后包袱，生产劲头不大。生产队党支部发现贫农社员高长生今年做了两千个劳动工分，比一般社员多做三分之一，而且他关心生产，爱社如家，就发动全队社员对照自己、学习高长生的先进事迹，在全队开展了“学高长生、赶高长生”的运动。社员们看到高长生这位在旧社会讨饭、做长工的老实人，每天不声不响地劳动，得到大队的表扬，大家都感到有奔头了。全队出工人数很快由六十多人增加到八十多人，五天中，全队四十亩晚稻三类苗突击追了肥，全部晚稻田都进行了治虫工作，在最近评比竞赛中，夺得了红旗。
    在竞赛中，无论干部、青年、老年和妇女，每个生产队都树立了标兵，开展竞赛。这种小范围的、具体到人的竞赛方法，不仅大家在一块劳动，抬头相见，便于互相学习，而且也便于互相帮助，共同进步。第二生产队和第一生产队只隔一条小港子，并排开展了生产竞赛。第二生产队是先进队，一直生产搞得较好，他们在提前完成黄麻中耕除草工作后，又出动四十多人，主动帮助第一生产队，使得第一队的黄麻三类苗很快消灭了。这种先进帮助后进的共产主义风格，得到大队总支的通报表扬，这样又在第二生产队的社员之间也掀起了先进帮助后进的运动。共青团员周天保是位“五好”社员，他与青年社员文国发开展积肥竞赛，要在五天内每人积肥七百五十担。周天保四天完成了竞赛条件，文国发到竞赛最后一天还差三百五十担任务没有完成，情绪低落。周天保当晚主动帮助他完成了积肥任务，使得文国发深受感动，生产劲头提起来了，一天积肥一百多担，质量很好。大队党总支表扬周天保帮助后进和文国发由后进转为先进的事迹，于是，全大队“后进赶先进、先进帮助后进”的生产竞赛高潮，更加广泛深入地开展起来。
