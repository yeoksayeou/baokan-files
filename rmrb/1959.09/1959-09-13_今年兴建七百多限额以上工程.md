    Over Seven Hundred Above-Quota Projects Under Construction This Year
    More Than 180 Projects Have Been Put Into Production in the First Eight Months, with Investment Completed Increasing by 19% Compared to the Same Period Last Year
    18,000 Small and Medium-Sized Projects Below Quota, More Than 8,300 Have Been Completed or Partially Completed in the First Seven Months
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th - This year, China's basic construction continues the great leap forward of last year and is proceeding at an unprecedented scale and speed. According to this year's plan, including continued construction and new projects, there are currently about seven hundred and eighty projects under construction throughout the country that are large and medium-sized projects above quota, and about eighteen thousand small and medium-sized projects below quota.
    The large and medium-sized projects under construction this year reach more than 85% of the projects under construction during the first five-year plan period. This year's national investment in basic construction will also reach half of the total investment of the central and local governments during the first five-year plan period. The average size of the projects under construction this year is larger than last year, so the national investment in basic construction this year is also tens of billions of yuan more than last year.
    The speed of basic construction projects in China this year has exceeded any previous year. According to materials from the State Statistical Bureau: From January to August this year, work with an investment of 14.4 billion yuan has been completed, which is more than 19% higher than the same period of last year's Great Leap Forward.
    The large and medium-sized projects under construction include many huge or complex projects. Such as the huge projects of the new blast furnace systems of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Baotou Iron and Steel Company, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in metallurgy, and the expansion project of Anshan Iron and Steel Company; the Sanmenxia hub project in water conservancy and electric power, the hydropower projects of Liujiaxia and Xin'anjiang, and the water conservancy projects of Miyun Reservoir, etc., and the 100,000-kilowatt unit project of Fuxin Power Plant; the new construction projects of the five major coal washing plants in Matou, Zhuzhou, Taiyuan, Xing'antai, and Handan with a total coal washing capacity of 8.8 million tons in coal; the continued construction projects of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory, and Luoyang First Tractor Factory, and the expansion projects of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, etc. in machinery; the Wuhan Second Cotton Textile Factory, Luoyang Textile Factory, and Shaanxi Seventh Cotton Textile Factory, etc. with more than 100,000 spindles in textiles; the Jiangxi Paper Mill, Guangdong Pearl River Paper Mill, Hunan Yueyang Paper Mill, and Henan Zhongmou Paper Mill, etc. with an annual output of more than 10,000 tons of paper, and the Taiyuan Sugar Factory, Inner Mongolia Hohhot Sugar Factory, Fujian Zhangzhou Sugar and Paper Factory, and Fujian Putian Sugar Factory, etc. with a daily pressing capacity of more than 1,000 tons of sugarcane or beets in light industry; the roadbed and track laying projects of important trunk lines such as Neikun, Lanqing, Lanxin, Xiangqian, and Chuanqian railways, and the double-tracking projects of important operating lines such as Jinpu and Jingguang railways.
    Among the small and medium-sized projects under construction, there are more than 6,700 in industries such as steel smelting, coal mining, coking, electricity, and textiles, 2,500 in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, 1,600 in transportation and postal services, and more than 7,000 in culture, education, and other fields.
    Except that most of the small and medium-sized projects below the quota belong to local construction, there are also 426 large and medium-sized projects above the quota that belong to local construction.
    It can be seen from the above projects that this year's basic construction in China fully reflects the central government's established set of policies of "walking on two legs," that is, large, medium, and small-sized projects are carried out simultaneously, light and heavy industries are carried out simultaneously, central and local industries are carried out simultaneously, and industry and agriculture are carried out simultaneously.
    According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, from January to August this year, more than 180 large and medium-sized construction projects above quota have been fully or partially completed and put into production, and from January to July, more than 8,300 small and medium-sized projects below quota have been fully or partially completed and put into production.
    Among these large and medium-sized construction projects that have been put into production, 44 are in steel, 4 in non-ferrous metals, 14 in machinery, 34 in electricity, 16 in coal, 5 in petroleum, 11 in chemicals, 16 in textiles, 15 in light industry, 5 in building materials, 10 in railways, 5 in transportation, 3 in postal services, and 4 in water conservancy. In metallurgy, there are the No. 2 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company with a volume of 1,386 cubic meters, a blast furnace of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company with a volume of 963 cubic meters, and blast furnaces of Handan Iron and Steel Company, Jinan Iron and Steel Plant, Anyang Iron and Steel Company, Nanchang Iron and Steel Plant, Nanjing Iron and Steel Plant, and Fushun Iron and Steel Plant, each with a volume of 255 cubic meters. Two 255 cubic meter blast furnaces of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 have been completed or put into production. There are also the thin plate rolling mill project of the semi-continuous rolling plate mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and one 65-hole coke oven each in Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and Anshan Iron and Steel, and one 71-hole coke oven in Shijingshan Iron and Steel; in electricity, there are the 100,000-kilowatt unit of Fuxin Power Plant, the 50,000-kilowatt unit of Beijing Thermal Power Station, two 25,000-kilowatt units of Shanghai Wangting Power Plant, and the 25,000-kilowatt unit of Harbin Thermal Power Station; in coal, there are the No. 1 vertical shaft of Yangquhe of Fengfeng Mining Bureau with an annual output of 900,000 tons, the Nanping Dong mine of Zhongliangshan in Sichuan, and Mine No. 7 of Pingdingshan in Henan, the Bijagang mine of Huainan Mining Bureau with an annual output of 450,000 tons of coal, and Mine No. 4 of Shizuishan in Ningxia with an annual output of 500,000 tons of coal; in petroleum, there is the Dushanzi Oil Refinery in Xinjiang, which is partially put into production; in chemicals, there is the synthetic ammonia project of Lanzhou Chemical Plant with an annual output of 25,000 tons; in cement, there are the Kunming Cement Plant and Datong Cement Plant (Phase II) project with an increased capacity of more than 100,000 tons; in textiles, there are the Jinhua Textile Factory in Shanxi, the Jiexiu Cotton Textile Factory in Shanxi, the Baoding Textile Factory, the Handan Cotton Textile Factory No. 3, the No. 7 State-owned Cotton Factory in Shaanxi, and the Xiaoshan Cotton Textile Factory in Zhejiang with an increased number of spindles of 10,000 to 40,000; in papermaking, there is the Wuhu Paperboard Factory with an increased capacity of 25,000 tons; in sugar making, there is the Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Factory in Guangdong with an annual output of 65,000 tons of machine-made sugar.
    In addition, in terms of railways, more than 1,100 kilometers of double-track and new lines of Jinpu, Jingguang, and Lanqing railways have been laid by the end of August. In terms of water conservancy and electric power, the Sanmenxia Dam and eleven large reservoirs such as Miyun, Gangnan, Wangkuai, Xiashijiazhuang, Xinlitun, and Songtao have all reached the flood control height before the flood season.
    The large and medium-sized enterprises that have been put into production have greatly increased China's industrial production capacity. The production capacity of rolled steel, iron smelting, coking, and natural petroleum has exceeded the cumulative new production capacity during the first five-year plan period, and compared with January to August last year, the new production capacity of rolled steel, coking, and natural petroleum has exceeded one to three times. The rapid growth of the production capacity of these weak links plays a major role in the continued leap forward of metallurgy and other industries.
    Among the more than 8,300 small and medium-sized construction projects that have been fully or partially put into production from January to July, 4,643 are in industry, 818 are in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, 705 are in transportation and postal services, 582 are in culture, education, and health, and 1,571 are in other projects. The production capacity of the small and medium-sized industrial enterprises that have been put into production, calculated in terms of annual output, is: iron smelting capacity of more than 1.2 million tons, coking capacity of 280,000 tons, coal mining capacity of 1.54 million tons, cement production capacity of 250,000 tons, nearly 150,000 cotton spindles, and a generating unit capacity of 120,000 kilowatts.
    According to a recent survey and analysis conducted by relevant departments on more than 7,200 large, medium, and small-sized typical factories and mines in steel, electricity, coal mines, machinery manufacturing, cement, paper making, textile, sugar making, and cigarette industries across the country, the labor productivity of large enterprises is higher than that of small and medium-sized enterprises, which is its advantage, so we must use it as the backbone of industry. However, large enterprises take a long time to build and require a lot of investment, and it is impossible to build many of them all at once. Small and medium-sized enterprises not only build faster, but also can obtain greater production capacity with the same investment. If we look at the value of output provided by an average of 10,000 yuan of fixed assets each year, small enterprises are about 125% more than large enterprises, and medium-sized enterprises are also about 48% more than large enterprises. It can be seen that the simultaneous development of medium and small-sized enterprises and large enterprises, especially the large-scale establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises this year, plays a major role in rapidly increasing the output of China's industrial products, thereby accelerating the development of the entire industry and agriculture, and more satisfying the needs of the broad masses to improve their lives.
    This year, China's basic construction is continuing to make a great leap forward. Let those domestic and foreign hostile elements who attack China's Great Leap Forward with rumors and distortions talk nonsense. China's industrial production and construction, like other fronts in the entire national economy, are continuing to leap forward more, faster, better, and more economically. This fact cannot be changed by the malicious propaganda of any imperialist elements and reactionaries!

    贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针　画最新最美的宏伟图画
    今年兴建七百多限额以上工程
    头八个月已有一百八十多个项目投入生产，完成投资额比去年同期增长19％
    限额以下中小工程一万八千个，头七个月已有八千三百多个建成或部分建成
    新华社12日讯　今年我国的基本建设继续去年的大跃进正以前所未有的规模和速度在进行。按照今年的计划，包括续建和新建工程在内，目前在全国各地建设着的工程，仅仅属于限额以上的大、中型项目就有七百八十个左右，限额以下的小型和中型项目达一万八千个左右。
    今年施工的限额以上的大、中型项目，达到第一个五年计划期间施工项目的85％以上。今年国家对基本建设的投资，也将达到第一个五年计划期间中央和地方的全部投资的一半。今年施工的项目平均规模比去年大，因而今年国家对基本建设的投资也比去年多几十亿元。
    今年我国基本建设工程施工的速度超过了以往任何一年。根据国家统计局材料：今年1月至8月，已经完成了投资额一百四十四亿元的工作，比大跃进的去年的同期高19％以上。
    正在建设的大、中型项目中，包括许多巨大的或复杂的工程。如冶金方面的武汉钢铁公司、包头钢铁公司、石景山钢铁公司、太原钢铁公司的新建高炉系统的巨大工程，和鞍山钢铁公司的扩建工程；水利电力方面的三门峡枢纽工程，刘家峡、新安江等水电工程和密云水库等水利工程，阜新发电厂的十万瓩机组工程；煤炭方面的洗煤能力合计八百八十万吨的马头、株洲、太原、兴安台、邯郸五大洗煤厂的新建工程；机械方面的太原重型机器厂、上海重型机器厂、洛阳第一拖拉机厂的续建工程，沈阳重型机器厂、哈尔滨电机厂等的扩建工程；纺织方面有十万锭以上的武汉第二棉纺织厂、洛阳纺织厂、陕西第七棉纺织厂等；轻工方面有年产纸一万吨以上的江西纸厂、广东珠江纸厂、湖南岳阳纸厂、河南中牟纸厂等，日榨甘蔗或甜菜一千吨以上的太原糖厂、内蒙古呼和浩特糖厂、福建漳州糖纸厂、福建莆田糖厂等；铁路方面的内昆、兰青、兰新、湘黔、川黔等重要干线的路基和铺轨工程，津浦、京广等重要营业线路的复线工程等。
    正在建设的小型和中型项目中，属于钢铁冶炼、采煤、炼焦、电力、纺织等工业方面的有六千七百多个，属于农林水利方面的有二千五百个，属于交通邮电方面的有一千六百个，属于文教和其他方面的有七千多个。
    除限额以下的小型和中型项目绝大部分属于地方建设的以外，在限额以上的大中型项目中，属于地方建设的也有四百二十六个。
    从上述项目中可以看到，今年我国的基本建设充分体现了中央确定的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，即大中小型同时并举，轻重工业同时并举，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，工业和农业同时并举。
    根据国家统计局的统计，今年1月到8月，已经有一百八十多个限额以上的大型和中型建设工程全部或部分建成投入生产，1月至7月有八千三百多个限额以下的小型和中型工程全部或部分建成投入生产。
    已经投入生产的这些大、中型建设工程，钢铁为四十四个，有色金属为四个，机械为十四个，电力为三十四个，煤炭为十六个，石油为五个，化工为十一个，纺织为十六个，轻工为十五个，建筑材料为五个，铁道为十个，交通为五个，邮电为三个，水利为四个。冶金方面有武汉钢铁公司的容积为一千三百八十六立米的二号高炉，石景山钢铁公司的容积为九百六十三立米的一座高炉，邯郸钢铁公司、济南钢铁厂、安阳钢铁公司、南昌钢铁厂、南京钢铁厂、抚顺市钢铁厂等的各一座容积都是二百五十五立米的高炉，上海钢铁一厂两座二百五十五立米高炉已经建成或投入生产。还有鞍山钢铁公司半连续轧板厂的薄板轧机工程，武钢、包钢、鞍钢的六十五孔焦炉各一座，石钢的七十一孔焦炉一座；电力方面有阜新发电厂的十万瓩机组，北京热电站五万瓩机组、上海望亭电厂二个二点五万瓩机组、哈尔滨热电站的二点五万瓩机组；煤炭方面有年产九十万吨的峰峰矿务局羊渠河一号立井、四川中梁山的南平峒矿井和河南平顶山七矿，淮南矿务局的年产四十五万吨煤的毕家岗矿井，宁夏石咀山四号年产五十万吨煤的矿井；石油方面有部分投入生产的新疆独山子油炼厂；化工方面有兰州化工厂的年产二点五万吨的合成氨工程；水泥方面有新增能力十几万吨的昆明水泥厂和大同水泥厂（二期）工程；纺织方面有新增纱锭一万到四万多的山西晋华纺织厂、山西介休棉纺织厂、保定纺织厂、邯郸棉纺三厂、陕西国棉七厂、浙江萧山棉纺织厂；造纸方面有芜湖纸板厂新增能力二点五万吨；制糖方面有年产机制糖六点五万吨的广东江门甘蔗化工厂。
    此外，铁路方面，津浦、京广、兰青等复线和新线，到8月底已铺轨一千一百多公里。水利电力方面，三门峡水坝和密云、岗南、王快、下石家庄、新立屯、松涛等十一座大型水库，都已经在汛前达到了拦洪高度。
    已经投入生产的限额以上的大中型企业使我国工业生产能力有很大增长。轧钢、炼铁、炼焦、天然石油都超过了第一个五年计划期间五年累计的新增生产能力，与去年1—8月比较，轧钢、炼焦、天然石油新增生产能力都超过一至三倍。这些薄弱环节生产能力的迅速增长，对冶金等工业的继续跃进具有重大作用。
    1—7月份已经全部或部分投入生产的八千三百多个小型和中型建设项目中，工业有四千六百四十三个，农、林、水利有八百一十八个，运输、邮电有七百零五个，文教卫生有五百八十二个，其他项目有一千五百七十一个。已经投入生产的中小型工业企业的生产能力以年产量计算是：炼铁能力一百二十多万吨，炼焦能力二十八万吨，采煤矿井一百五十四万吨，水泥生产能力二十五万吨，棉纺锭近十五万个，发电机装机容量十二万瓩。
    根据有关部门最近对全国各地七千二百多个钢铁、电力、煤矿、机械制造、水泥、造纸、纺织、制糖、制烟等行业的大、中、小型典型厂矿所进行的调查分析，大型企业的劳动生产率比小型、中型企业高，这是它的优越性，所以我们要以它作工业的骨干。但是大型企业建设时间长，需要的投资多，不可能一下就建设得很多。而小型、中型企业不仅建设快，用同样的投资还可以得到更大的生产能力。如果拿一万元的固定资产平均每年提供的产值来看，则小型企业比大型企业多125％左右，中型企业比大型企业也多48％左右。可见中、小型企业和大型企业同时并举，尤其是今年大量的举办了小型和中型企业，对于迅速增加我国工业产品的产量从而加速整个工农业的发展，和更多地满足广大群众提高生活的需要，是有重大作用的。
    今年我国的基本建设在继续大跃进。让那些以造谣歪曲来攻击我国大跃进的国内外敌对分子去胡言乱语吧，我国的工业生产和建设同整个国民经济中其他战线一样，正在继续多快好省地、一日千里地跃进着，这一事实不是任何帝国主义分子和反动分子的恶毒宣传所能改变分毫的！
