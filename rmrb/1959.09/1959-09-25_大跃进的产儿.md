The Great Leap Forward is like a magical brush, adding countless newest and most beautiful pictures to the motherland's vast landscape in just over a year. In the capital, a batch of magnificent and modern public buildings have been completed. The Great Hall of the People, the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the Museum of Chinese History, the Military Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, the Cultural Palace of Nationalities, the Beijing Railway Station, the Workers' Stadium... The completion of these large-scale and advanced buildings is a major event in the political, economic, and cultural life of our people. This is an iron example of the Great Leap Forward and high speed, and a pioneering undertaking in the history of Chinese architecture! We extend our warm congratulations to all comrades who participated in the construction of these projects!

Whether an outsider looks at it or an insider calculates with numbers, everyone will marvel at the high speed of construction of this batch of buildings. The Great Hall of the People, including the 10,000-seat auditorium, the 5,000-seat banquet hall, and numerous meeting rooms, lounges, and offices of various sizes, has a total construction area of more than 170,000 square meters, which is larger than the entire effective construction area of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The steel roof truss composed of twelve steel beams spanning 60 meters in the 10,000-seat auditorium is almost two stories high, each weighing 55 tons. This building also excellently implements the principles of practicality, economy, and aesthetics. The Beijing Railway Station can handle 200,000 passengers every day. The station's switches and signals are controlled remotely, and on-site shunting operations are directed by ultra-shortwave radio. The Workers' Stadium covers an area of more than 35 hectares, and the central stadium can accommodate 80,000 spectators. The facilities are complete, and there are television broadcasting facilities... The scale and the complexity of the design and construction technology are imaginable. However, the actual construction time was less than a year. Looking back at some of the tall buildings built in Shanghai before liberation, only one Daxon Department Store (now the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store Building) was designed and built by the Chinese themselves. This building has a construction area of less than 20,000 square meters, which is only one-tenth of the Great Hall of the People, but it took about two years from the start of design to completion. As for the building's engineering structure, scientific equipment, functional uses, and artistic styling, it cannot be compared with the Great Hall of the People and other buildings. Look, think, how can we not praise the miracle of high speed created by our construction workers and technicians!

However, this miracle did not fall from the sky, nor is it a magician's illusion. It is the result of the rapid development of our national economy, the rapid improvement of technical level and construction organization and management level in the past ten years, especially the product of the Great Leap Forward since last year. For a building like the Great Hall of the People, according to conventional practices, it would take a year for design, half a year for preparation, and three years for construction. If the Great Leap Forward had not liberated people's minds, who would dare to accept the arduous task of completing the design and construction all within one year? If the Great Leap Forward had not inspired people's pioneering spirit, it would have been difficult for designers to complete such a highly complex and large-scale design in such a short period of time. If the Great Leap Forward had not liberated people's minds, some complex technical problems could not have been solved quickly. For example, it was once a difficult problem to lift a steel roof truss seven meters high and spanning sixty meters from the ground to the roof more than forty meters high, but the hoisting workers, under the guidance of Soviet experts, dared to think and dare to do, and broke through this difficult situation by combining indigenous and foreign methods. For example, the Great Hall of the People needed 1,200 rebar workers and more than 2,000 marble workers. Where could so many skilled workers be found at once? The mass movement of multi-skilled workers enabled bricklayers, carpenters, and other workers to do these jobs. Under the guidance of the spirit of great collaboration greatly promoted since the Great Leap Forward, thousands of technical personnel from all over the country were sent to the Great Hall of the People and other public buildings, and large quantities of materials and equipment were sent, so that these projects were fully guaranteed in terms of manpower and materials. These facts fully show that with the nationwide Great Leap Forward, there is the unprecedented high speed of this batch of buildings.

The soaring enthusiasm and pioneering spirit of workers and technicians are the key to the high-speed completion of this batch of buildings. On the construction sites where mass movements were surging, and in the relevant design institutes and factories, the vast numbers of workers and technicians were not afraid of difficulties, did not avoid dangers, went all out, and worked with selfless spirit. Some people even worked ten or twelve hours in order to complete a complex task. They did not care about remuneration and worked hard. In the process of constructing the Great Hall of the People and other projects, we also saw the spirit of "great initiative" that Lenin praised in "Communist Saturdays," "the initiative of consciously and voluntarily raising labor productivity, establishing new labor discipline, and creating socialist economic and living conditions" (Lenin's words). The high-speed completion of this batch of buildings also proves that continuously promoting the communist style, vigorously carrying out mass movements, can promote socialist construction forward at high speed. From the fact that this batch of buildings was built at high speed, we can clearly see that once the general line's thinking is grasped by the masses, it can generate earth-shattering power and high speed of socialist construction. The rapid completion of public buildings such as the Great Hall of the People is a victory for vigorous mass movements, a victory for great collaboration, a victory for the communist ideas of daring to think, daring to do, and selfless labor, and ultimately, a victory for the general line.

The high-speed completion of this batch of buildings is a great leap forward in the urban construction of the capital and a great victory on the basic construction front of our country. Under the glorious banner of the general line, the basic construction departments will continue to advance at high speed, and our entire cause will continue to advance at high speed!

    大跃进的产儿
    大跃进像一支神奇的彩笔，一年多的时间，为祖国万里江山增添了无数最新最美的画图。在首都，一批雄伟的现代化的公共建筑落成了。人民大会堂，中国革命博物馆，中国历史博物馆，中国人民革命军事博物馆，全国农业展览馆，民族文化宫，北京车站，工人体育场……这些规模宏大、设备先进的建筑物的落成，是我国人民政治生活、经济生活、文化生活中的重大事件。这是大跃进和高速度的铁的例证，这是我国建筑史上的创举！我们向所有参加这些工程的建设的同志们致以热烈的祝贺！
    无论是外行人用眼看，还是内行人用数字计算，谁也要惊叹这批建筑建设的高速度。人民大会堂，包括万人礼堂，五千座席的宴会厅，以及大大小小数目众多的会议室、休息厅和办公室，总建筑面积达十七万多平方米，比北京故宫的全部有效建筑面积还大。万人礼堂上由十二榀钢梁组成的、六十米跨度的钢屋架，本身就几乎有两层楼高，其中每榀重达五十五吨。这一建筑还出色地贯彻了适用、经济、美观的原则。北京车站每天能接送二十万旅客，车站的道岔和信号都是远距离操纵，现场的调车作业用超短波无线电指挥。工人体育场占地三十五公顷多，中心运动场能容纳八万观众，场内设备完善，并有电视转播等装置……。规模之大，设计、施工技术之复杂可以想见。可是，实际建设时间都不到一年。再看看解放前上海建造的一些高楼大厦，其中中国人自己设计、自己建设的只有一个大新公司（现在的上海第一百货商店大楼）。这座楼建筑面积不到两万平方米，只等于人民大会堂的十分之一，然而从开始设计到竣工用了大约两年时间。至于这个建筑的工程结构、科学设备、使用功能、艺术造型等，那就更不能与人民大会堂等建筑相比了。看看，想想，怎能不赞颂我们的建筑工人、技术人员所创造的这种高速度的奇迹！
    然而，这一奇迹并非从天而降，也不是魔术师的幻术。它是十年来我国国民经济迅速发展、技术水平和施工组织管理水平迅速提高的结果，特别是去年以来大跃进的产物。像人民大会堂这样的建筑，按照常规，总要一年设计半年准备三载施工，如果不是大跃进解放了人们的思想，有谁敢于接受一年内设计、施工全部完成这样的艰巨任务？如果不是大跃进鼓舞了人们的首创精神，设计师们也难于在这样短的时间内，完成这样高度复杂规模巨大的设计。如果不是大跃进解放了人们的思想，一些复杂的技术问题，就不能迅速地得到解决。例如，把七米高、六十米长跨度的钢屋架，从地面吊到四十多米高的屋顶上去，曾是一个难题，但是吊装工人们在苏联专家指导下，敢想敢干，用土洋结合的办法突破了这个难关。再如，人民大会堂需要一千二百名钢筋工、两千多名大理石工，这么多技术工人一时到哪儿去找？多面手的群众运动使泥瓦工、木工等也能干这些活了。在大跃进以来大大发扬起来的大协作思想指导下，全国各地为人民大会堂等公共建筑派来了成千上万的技术人材，送来了大批大批的材料、设备，使这些工程在人力、物力方面得到了充分的保证。这些事实充分说明，有了全国的大跃进，才有这批建筑的空前的高速度。
    工人们和技术人员们的冲天干劲和首创精神，是这批建筑所以能高速度建成的关键。在群众运动风起云涌的建筑工地上，以及有关的设计院和工厂里，广大工人、技术人员不怕困难，不避艰险，鼓足干劲，以忘我的精神劳动着。有的人为了完成某项复杂的工作，甚至工作十小时，十二小时。他们不计报酬，努力工作。在人民大会堂等工程的建设过程中，我们也看到了列宁称颂“共产主义星期六”的那种“伟大的创举”的精神，“自觉自愿提高劳动生产率、建立新的劳动纪律、创造社会主义的经济条件和生活条件的首创精神”（列宁语）。这批建筑的高速建成，也证明了不断发扬共产主义的风格，大搞群众运动，就能把社会主义建设高速度地向前推进。从这批建筑高速度建设的事实中，我们清楚地看到，总路线的思想，一经群众掌握，便能产生移山倒海的力量，便能产生社会主义建设的高速度。人民大会堂等公共建筑的迅速建成，是大搞群众运动的胜利，大协作的胜利，敢想敢干、忘我劳动的共产主义思想的胜利，归根结底，是总路线的胜利。
    这批建筑的高速建成，是首都城市建设的大跃进，是我国基本建设战线上的一个伟大胜利。在总路线的光辉旗帜下，基本建设部门将继续高速度前进，我们整个的事业也将继续高速度前进！
