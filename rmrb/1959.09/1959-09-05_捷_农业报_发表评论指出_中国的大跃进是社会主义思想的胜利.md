Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd. Today, the Czechoslovakian "Agricultural Newspaper" published a commentary entitled "The Great Leap Forward," the full text of which is as follows:

　　From ancient times until recently, people always regarded the Great Wall—the symbol of the great nation's isolation from the world—as the most typical representation of China. This was no accident, because for hundreds of years, China had been isolated from new and progressive things, remaining in the zombie of the old system.

　　Today, it is difficult to regard the Great Wall as the most typical thing about China. In our era, there are many other things that are symbols of China. One of them is the term that was unfamiliar to people not long ago—"The Great Leap Forward."

　　Apart from using "The Great Leap Forward," it is impossible to find a more appropriate term to indicate the great economic achievements China has achieved in the past period. If we did not know that these achievements were the labor results of millions of ordinary Chinese people, we could really call it a miracle. The slaves in the Chinese countryside in the past have now become free members of the commune, and the slaves in the factories of Chinese and foreign capitalists have now become free workers.

　　The Great Leap Forward in Chinese life was realized last year. Last year, various agricultural products, especially wheat, rice, and cotton, reached the highest harvest. Industrial products, steel, coal, machinery products, consumer goods, especially textiles, also reached high records. China, which had always been backward in the past, has surpassed advanced capitalist countries in some products last year.

　　Existing achievements and figures show that China will surpass last year's Great Leap Forward this year. Although this year's natural disasters, especially large-scale floods and droughts, are unfavorable to agriculture, the summer grain harvest is 1.25 million tons more than last year. This is mainly the achievement of the People's Commune. The growth of industrial production is even greater: the total value of industrial output in the first half of this year increased by 65% compared with the same period in 1958. The increase in some of the most important products is even faster—iron production increased by 160%, steel by 66%, coal by more than double, metal cutting machine tools by double, and cotton cloth and sugar production also increased significantly.

　　These achievements make this year's tasks able to be set very high. Not long ago, the meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China studied these issues and decided that this year's plan is still a plan for a continued Great Leap Forward. The entire steel production will increase by half, and coal production will increase by a quarter. No capitalist country has ever been able to achieve such progress in production in such a short period of time. People's China will complete its ambitious plan ahead of schedule, reaching the production level that will only be reached at the end of the second five-year plan in 1962 this year.

　　This means that China's original plan to surpass Britain in major industrial products in fifteen years will be completed in ten years. Not long ago, China was a colony that Britain could plunder at will without any effort.

　　If we didn't see the same achievements in the Soviet countries and in the People's Democratic countries, we could really call it a miracle. There is only one explanation for the "Great Leap Forward in China," and that is the victory of the great socialist ideology.

    捷“农业报”发表评论指出
    中国的大跃进是社会主义思想的胜利
    新华社布拉格3日电　今天的捷克斯洛伐克“农业报”以“大跃进”为题发表评论，全文如下：
    从遥远的古代到不久以前，人都是把长城——这个伟大的国家与世隔绝的象征——作为代表中国的最典型的东西。这不是偶然的，因为数百年来，中国都与新的、进步的东西隔离，停留在旧制度的僵尸中。
    今天，很难再把长城作为中国的最典型的东西了，在我们的时代里，有另外许多东西是中国的象征。其中之一便是不久前对人们还是生疏的名词——“大跃进”。
    除用“大跃进”外，找不出更恰当的名词来表明中国在过去一个时期所获得的伟大的经济成就。假若我们不知道这些成就是千百万普通的中国人民的劳动成果的话，真可以把它称作奇迹。过去中国农村里的奴隶，今天已成为公社中自由的社员，在中国和外国资本家工厂里的奴隶，今日也已成为自由的工人。
    中国生活中的大跃进是在去年实现的，去年各种农产品，特别是小麦、大米和棉花都达到了最高的收成。工业品，钢、煤、机械产品，消费品，特别是纺织品的产量也达到高的纪录。过去一向落后的中国去年已在一些产品方面超过了先进的资本主义国家。
    现有的成就和数字表明，中国今年还要超过去年的大跃进。虽然今年的自然灾害，特别是大面积的水灾和旱灾对农业不利，但粮食的夏季收成比去年还多一百二十五万吨。这主要是人民公社的成绩。工业生产的增长更大：工业总产值在今年上半年比1958年同时期增加了65％。其中一些最重要的产品的提高更快——铁的生产提高了160％，钢66％，煤一倍多，金属切削机床一倍，棉布和糖的生产也有很大的提高。
    这些成就使得今年的任务能够订得很高，不久前中共中央的会议，研究了这些问题，并决定了今年的计划仍是一个继续大跃进的计划。整个钢的生产将提高一半，煤的产量提高四分之一。任何资本主义国家没有也不可能在这样短的时间内在生产上取得这样的进度。人民中国将提前完成自己提出的豪迈计划，在今年就将达到在第二个五年计划末1962年才能达到的生产水平。
    这就是说，中国原计划在十五年期间在主要工业产品方面超过英国的任务将提前在十年内完成。而不久以前，中国还是英国不费任何力量任意掠夺的殖民地。
    假若不在苏维埃的国家里、在人民民主的国家里看到同样的业绩，真可以说它是奇迹。“中国的大跃进”的说明只有一个，那就是伟大的社会主义思想的胜利。
