    Five new and expanded steel rolling workshops have been built in Beijing this year. They can roll about 300,000 tons of steel annually, including round steel, square steel, angle steel, and wire steel. In Beijing, which ended its history of having iron but no steel last year, a large amount of steel can be produced this year.
    Among the five newly built steel rolling workshops, the steel rolling workshops of Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, and Beijing Steel Plant have been completed and put into production one after another. The wire workshop of Jianguo Steel Rolling Plant has also been partially put into production. The steel rolling workshop of Beijing Electronic Tube Factory is installing equipment and will be test-run soon. These five steel rolling workshops all started construction between March and April this year. In order to ensure that the rolling mills produced steel as soon as possible, the construction workers quickly completed nearly 14,000 square meters of factory buildings in less than four months.
    The equipment for this batch of steel rolling workshops, except for the rolling mill of Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, which was supported by Chongqing Wangjiang Machinery Factory, is mostly manufactured in Beijing. (Attached picture)

    北京新建和扩建五个轧钢车间
    新华社讯　北京今年新建和扩建五个轧钢车间。它们每年能轧制钢材三十万吨左右，圆钢、方钢、角钢、线材钢等都能轧制。在去年结束了有铁无钢历史的北京，今年又能生产大批钢材了。
    新建的五个轧钢车间中，北京农业机械厂、长辛店机车车辆工厂、北京钢厂的轧钢车间，都已相继建成并投入生产，建国轧钢厂的线材车间也已部分投入生产；北京电子管厂的轧钢车间正在安装设备，最近即可试车。这五个轧钢车间都是在今年3、4月间开始建设的。建筑工人们为保证轧机早日轧出钢材，不到四个月期间，就迅速地完成了将近一万四千平方米的厂房建筑。
    这一批轧钢车间的设备，除了北京电子管厂的轧机是由重庆望江机械厂支援的以外，绝大部分都是北京制造的。（附图片）
