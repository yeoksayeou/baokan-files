Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 30th: TASS reported that letters and telegrams protesting the illegal arrest of Farajallah Helou are flooding into Cairo and Damascus.

The Lebanese "Voice of the People" newspaper published two letters of protest addressed to UAR President Nasser: one from 188 political prisoners in Egyptian prisons, and the other from a French citizen named Raymond.

The political prisoners wrote in their letter: "We hold different political views, but we are united in our indignation at the illegal arrest and torture of Helou. We demand his release."

Raymond said in his letter: "Mr. President, when the British and French governments put pressure on you after the nationalization of the Suez Canal, all those with democratic views unanimously and strongly condemned this attempt. At that time, this condemnation received widespread support, and your resistance was supported, and justice finally prevailed. Mr. President, I am concerned about Helou's fate, and I ask you to restore his freedom. Mr. President, honest people all over the world are now concerned about this. Only those who bombed your cities and villages a few years ago are cheering for you."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 28th: Some Iraqi newspapers have published many telegrams from social groups in various places sent to their editorial departments demanding the release of the prominent Lebanese social activist and writer Farajallah Helou, who was illegally arrested by the UAR authorities.

These newspapers support this just demand and call on world opinion to defend this Lebanese patriot. "People's Voice" wrote today that the illegal arrest of the Arab patriot Helou by the UAR ruling clique has aroused the attention of the entire international public opinion. The newspaper said that Helou is deeply respected among progressive international figures and Arab figures because he is a firm and unwavering fighter against imperialism and reactionary forces.

    埃及政治犯自狱中发出呼声
    抗议阿联当局迫害赫卢
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特30日讯：据报纸报道，抗议非法逮捕法拉贾拉·赫卢的信件和电报纷纷送往开罗和大马士革。
    黎巴嫩“呼声报”刊登了致阿联总统纳赛尔的两封抗议信：一封是埃及监狱中的一百八十八名政治犯写的：另一封是法国公民雷蒙写的。
    政治犯们在信中写道：“我们抱有不同的政治观点，但是，我们对非法逮捕赫卢并且对他施加严刑拷打却一致表示愤慨。我们要求释放赫卢。”
    雷蒙在信中说：“总统先生，在苏伊士运河国有化以后，英法政府向你施加压力的时候，所有抱着民主观点的人一致猛烈谴责了这种企图。当时，这种谴责受到了普遍的支持，你的抵抗也受到支持，正义终于取得了胜利。总统先生，我对赫卢的命运感到耽心，我要求你恢复他的自由。总统先生，现在全世界正直的人们都为此感到耽心。为你喝采的仅仅是那些在几年以前轰炸过贵国城市和乡村的人”。
    新华社巴格达28日电　一些伊拉克报纸刊登了各地社会团体发给它们的编辑部的许多要求释放被阿联当局非法逮捕的黎巴嫩著名社会活动家和作家法拉贾拉·赫卢的电报。
    这些报纸支持这种正义要求，并且呼吁世界舆论起来保卫这位黎巴嫩爱国者。“人民之声报”今天写道，目前，阿联统治集团非法逮捕阿拉伯爱国者赫卢的事件引起了整个国际舆论的重视。报纸说，赫卢在进步的国际人士和阿拉伯人士中间深受尊敬，因为他是反对帝国主义和反动势力的坚定不移的战士。
