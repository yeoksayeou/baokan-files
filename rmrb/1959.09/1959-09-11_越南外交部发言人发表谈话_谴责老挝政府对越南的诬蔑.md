Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 10th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today, sternly refuting the statement made by Lao Kingdom's Foreign Minister, Phoui Sananikone, on September 8th in Bangkok before leaving for the United Nations as "extremely absurd lies."

Phoui Sananikone falsely claimed that "North Vietnam once fired heavy artillery from the forests of North Vietnam into Lao territory, and more than 4,000 communist troops advanced fifty kilometers into Lao territory."

The spokesman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry told reporters in Hanoi that, according to a foreign news agency report on September 8th, the Deputy Minister of Propaganda of Laos, Natchampassak, said the day before that the "situation in all parts of Laos is calm," and the next day told reporters that "seven hundred Viet Minh troops appeared near the small stronghold of Sang De, southeast of Sam Neua." When reporters further inquired, the Lao Deputy Minister of Propaganda said, "These are not Viet Minh troops, but Black Tai ethnic minorities scattered in the mountainous areas on both sides of the border."

The spokesman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry emphasized that the fact that the statements made by the Lao authorities are often self-contradictory all the more clearly exposes the clumsiness of their methods of rudely slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The spokesman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry then said that the Deputy Minister of Propaganda of the Kingdom of Laos, Natchampassak, also insisted: "When the North Vietnamese troops know that the United Nations observers are about to leave for Laos, they will withdraw to the other side of the border." This is another attempt to deceive public opinion, with the aim of preparing to defend their consistent slander against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    越南外交部发言人发表谈话
    谴责老挝政府对越南的诬蔑
    新华社河内10日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天发表谈话，严正驳斥老挝王国政府外交大臣班雅9月8日在曼谷启程赴联合国前发表的声明是“极端荒谬的谎言”。
    班雅造谣说，“北越曾经从北越森林向老挝领土开大炮，四千多名共军向老挝领土深进五十公里”。
    越南外交部发言人向河内的记者们说，据一家外国通讯社9月8日报道的消息，老挝宣传副大臣纳占巴萨头一天说老挝各地“情况都平静”，第二天又告诉记者们说“七百个越盟军队出现在桑怒东南的桑德小据点附近”，当记者进一步追问的时候，老挝宣传副大臣又说，“这不是越盟军队，而是散布在边界两边山区，黑傣少数民族”。
    越南外交部发言人强调说，老挝当局发表的声明常常自相矛盾这一事实，就更加清楚地暴露了他们粗暴诬蔑越南民主共和国的手段的拙劣。
    越南外交部发言人接着说，老挝王国宣传副大臣纳占巴萨还硬说：“北越军队在知道联合国观察员启程来老挝的时候，他们将撤到边界对面去”，这是又一欺骗舆论的论调，目的是准备为他们一向诬蔑越南民主共和国的论调辩护。
