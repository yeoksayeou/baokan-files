Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 21st. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the 21st of August regarding the Laotian situation, stating that the Sananikone government of Laos and the United States should bear the main responsibility for undermining the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

The statement indicated that the German Democratic Republic supports the various statements and proposals made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, and the former Pathet Lao forces regarding the demand for a peaceful resolution of the Laotian issue based on the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and believes that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, and the former Pathet Lao forces have consistently and strictly adhered to these agreements.

The German Democratic Republic welcomes the demands made by the Polish government and the Indian government regarding the resumption of the activities of the International Commission for Laos in order to implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and fully supports the statement issued by the Soviet government on August 18th this year regarding the Laotian situation.

The statement pointed out that the United States and the government of the Kingdom of Laos are colluding to conduct military provocations. The United States is handing over large quantities of weapons, ammunition, and other materials to the army of the Kingdom of Laos. Since June 1959, more than one hundred so-called military advisors have been sent from the United States to Laos. Under the guidance of American military advisors, airports and other military facilities are being constructed.

At the same time, the United States is threatening to use the armed forces of its partners in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to deal with the movement within Laos that strives for peace, democracy, national unity, and independence. In order to continue hiding behind the scenes, the United States has allowed the Thai government to issue an aggressive statement, threatening that Thailand is prepared to carry out military intervention in Laos.

The statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic emphasized that the root cause of the danger of war in Laos must be eliminated. If the International Commission for Laos can resume its work without hindrance, if the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements are fully implemented, if Laos acts responsibly in accordance with the principles indicated by the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and if the United States completely ceases its interference in Laos, then the root cause of this danger of war can be eliminated.

The statement concluded by saying that the German Democratic Republic firmly stands on the side of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, on the side of all other forces that uphold just solutions and oppose the aggressive policies of American imperialism and the provocations of its Laotian lackeys.

    德意志民主共和国外交部发表声明
    支持越中关于老挝问题的建议
    指出美国和萨纳尼空政府的挑衅是老挝战争危险根源
    新华社柏林电　德意志民主共和国外交部8月21日就老挝局势发表声明说，老挝的萨纳尼空政府和美国应当对破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议负主要责任。
    声明表示，德意志民主共和国支持越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国和前寮国战斗部队关于要求根据日内瓦协议和万象协议来和平解决老挝问题的各项声明和建议，并且认为，越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国和前寮国战斗部队始终如一地严格遵守这些协议。
    德意志民主共和国欢迎波兰政府和印度政府关于恢复老挝国际委员会的活动以便实施日内瓦协议和万象协议的要求，并且完全支持苏联政府今年8月18日发表的关于老挝局势的声明。
    声明指出，美国和老挝王国政府同谋，进行军事挑衅。美国正在把大量的武器、弹药等交给老挝王国军队。自从1959年6月以来，已有一百多名所谓军事顾问从美国派往老挝。在美国军事顾问的指导下，正在建造飞机场和其他的军事设施。
    同时，美国扬言要利用它的东南亚条约中的伙伴的武装部队来对付老挝境内争取和平、民主、民族团结和独立的运动。美国为了继续躲在幕后，让泰国政府发表了一个侵略性的声明。扬言泰国准备对老挝进行军事干涉。
    德意志民主共和国外交部的声明强调说，必须消除老挝的战争危险的根源。如果老挝国际委员会能够不受阻碍地恢复工作，如果日内瓦协议和万象协议得到充分的实现，如果老挝以负责态度按照日内瓦协议和万象协议所指出的方针行事，如果美国完全停止它对老挝的干涉，那末，这种战争危险的根源就能消除。
    声明最后说，德意志民主共和国坚决站在越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国这一边，站在维护公正的解决办法、反对美国帝国主义的侵略政策和它的老挝爪牙的挑衅的一切其他力量这一边。
