Shaanxi Basic Construction Cadres Propose Ambitious Plan
    To Complete Annual Capital Construction Tasks One Month Ahead of Schedule

    (According to Shaanxi Daily) The Shaanxi Provincial Construction Commission convened a provincial-level mobilization meeting of five-level cadres in Xi'an on the afternoon of September 21st, calling on the staff and workers on the province's capital construction front to continue to deeply oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost their vigor, resolutely strive to complete 70% of the annual plan by the end of September to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, and to complete the annual capital construction tasks one month ahead of schedule.

    Wang Lin, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, Yang Zhengmin, Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province, Wu Shalang, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and Feng Zhi, Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, attended the mobilization meeting and delivered speeches.

    Comrade Wang Lin's speech first analyzed the current situation. He said that the current situation is very good. After the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, right-leaning and slackening sentiments were criticized, and a vigorous and thriving production increase and economy campaign was quickly launched on the province's capital construction front. Various production indicators have been broken repeatedly. The plan completion in August and the first half of September has been continuously rising. As of September 15th, the province has completed 59.1% of the annual capital construction plan. Comrade Wang Lin said that it is entirely possible to complete 70% of the annual investment and 75% of the construction and installation workload by the end of September. He asked the staff and workers on the province's capital construction front to be urgently mobilized, advance victoriously, concentrate superior forces, cooperate closely, fight a few beautiful battles fiercely, and do everything possible to turn this possibility into reality in order to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland.

    Comrade Wang Lin also emphasized the significance of launching mass movements in capital construction in his speech. He said: During the Great Leap Forward, we resolutely implemented the principle of putting politics in command and the Party's mass line on the capital construction front. The broad masses of staff and workers emancipated their minds and displayed a communist style of daring to think and daring to act, which not only doubled the construction speed but also saved half of the investment. At the same time, many projects that adopted rapid construction, due to the emphasis on quality, the establishment of strong on-site command posts, and strict inspection systems, and good arrangements for production preparation, the project quality also fully met the standards.

    Comrade Wang Lin finally called on the staff and workers on the province's capital construction front to go all out, aim high, and strive to complete 70% of the annual plan by the end of September and complete this year's tasks one month ahead of schedule with practical actions to support the Party's general line for socialist construction.

    In his speech, Vice Governor Yang Zhengmin, after analyzing the current capital construction situation and existing problems, focused on giving instructions on how to continue to leap forward in capital construction in the future and strive to complete the annual tasks one month ahead of schedule. After Vice Governor Yang Zhengmin's speech, Comrade Wu Shalang, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and Comrade Feng Zhi, Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, delivered speeches on how to strengthen the Party's leadership over capital construction work and organize and mobilize the masses to carry out comparisons, learning, catching up, competition, and promotion of advanced experiences.

    At the mobilization meeting, Yu Wen, Director of Yaoxian Cement Factory, Xu Heng, Deputy Director of Xi'an Bayi Iron Factory, Ding Jukui, Captain of the Red Flag Assault Team of Carpenters of the Provincial Construction Fourth Company, Sun Anbang, Director of the Second Engineering Department of the Provincial Construction Third Company, and Huang Jia, Chief Engineer of the Third Engineering Department, spoke successively. They all expressed their support for the call of the mobilization meeting, introduced the capital construction situation of their units, and put forward specific guarantees and measures to complete this year's capital construction plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.

    陕西基本建设干部提出雄伟计划
    提前一月完成全年基建任务
    据陕西日报消息　陕西省建设委员会于9月21日下午，在西安召开了全省基本建设五级干部动员大会，号召全省基本建设战线职工继续深入反右倾、鼓干劲，坚决争取在9月底完成全年计划的70％，迎接建国十周年，和提前一个月完成全年基本建设任务。
    中共陕西省委书记王林、陕西省副省长杨拯民、省总工会副主席吴沙浪和中共西安市委书记冯直，参加了动员大会并作了讲话。
    王林同志的讲话，首先分析了目前的形势。他说，目前形势很好，党的八届八中全会的决议公布以后，右倾松劲情绪受到了批判，全省基本建设战线上迅速地掀起了一个蓬蓬勃勃、热火朝天的增产节约运动。各项生产指标一再突破，8月份和9月上半月计划完成情况一直是直线上升，到9月15日为止，全省已经完成了全年基本建设计划的59.1％。王林同志说，到9月底完成年投资额的70％，建筑安装工作量的75％，是完全有可能的。他要求全省基本建设战线上的职工，紧急动员起来，乘胜前进，集中优势兵力，通力协作，狠狠地打几个漂亮仗，千方百计地把这个可能性变成现实性，以迎接我们伟大祖国建国十周年。
    王林同志在讲话中还着重说明在基本建设中大搞群众运动的意义。他说：大跃进过程中我们在基本建设战线上，坚决地贯彻执行了政治挂帅和党的群众路线，广大职工解放思想，发挥了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，不仅使施工速度快了一倍，而且节约了一半的投资。同时，很多采取快速施工的工程，由于强调了质量，建立了坚强的现场指挥部，和严格的检验制度，生产准备工作安排的好，工程质量也完全合乎标准。
    王林同志最后号召全省基本建设职工，鼓足干劲，力争上游，以争取9月底完成全年计划的70％和提前一个月完成今年任务的实际行动，拥护党的社会主义建设总路线。
    杨拯民副省长的讲话，在分析了当前基本建设情况和存在的问题后，着重对今后基本建设如何继续跃进，争取提前一个月完成全年任务作了指示。杨拯民副省长讲话后，省总工会副主席吴沙浪同志和中共西安市委书记冯直同志，就如何加强党对基本建设工作的领导以及组织发动群众开展比、学、赶、竞赛、推广先进经验等问题作了讲话。
    动员大会上，耀县水泥厂厂长于文、西安八一铁厂副厂长徐珩、省建四公司木工红旗突击队队长丁聚魁、省建三公司二工程处主任孙安邦和三工程处主任工程师黄嘉等相继发言。他们一致表示拥护动员大会的号召，并介绍了本单位的基本建设情况，和提出提前超额完成今年基本建设计划的具体保证和措施。
