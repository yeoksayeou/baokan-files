Xinhua News Agency, London, September 9th: Henry Twynam, a Briton who served as Governor of Assam in northeastern India twenty years ago, pointed out in a letter to "The Times" on the 2nd that the so-called McMahon Line on the Sino-Indian border has never been recognized.

Twynam said, "Ever since the Chinese began issuing maps showing India's border ending at the foothills north of the Brahmaputra River, the Indian government, whether run by the British or the Indians, has been emphasizing the so-called McMahon Line."

Twynam said, "But the McMahon Line, which attempts to use the Himalayan summit as the border, does not exist and has never existed."

Twynam pointed out that successive Chinese governments have refused to ratify the treaty proposed by British colonialists at the Simla Conference in 1913-1914.

Twynam believes that the Indian government is "pursuing an active policy of probing and infiltrating the vast hinterland between the Brahmaputra River basin and the Himalayas."

    前印度阿萨姆邦英国长官特怀南说
    所谓麦克马洪线从未得到承认
    新华社9日讯　伦敦消息：二十年前做过印度东北部阿萨姆邦长官的英国人亨利·特怀南2日在写给“泰晤士报”的一封信里指出，所谓中印边境的麦克马洪线从来就没有得到承认。
    特怀南说，“自从中国人开始印发说明印度的边界止于布拉马普特拉河北岸的山麓的地图以来，印度的政府，无论是英国人管的还是印度人管的，一直强调所谓麦克马洪线。”
    特怀南说，“但是试图以喜马拉雅山山顶作为边界的麦克马洪线并不存在而且从来就没有存在过。”
    特怀南指出，历届中国政府一直拒绝批准英国殖民主义者在1913—1914年西姆拉会议上所提出的条约。
    特怀南认为，印度政府是“奉行了一种探测和渗入布拉马普特拉河流域和喜马拉雅山之间的广阔腹地的积极政策”。
