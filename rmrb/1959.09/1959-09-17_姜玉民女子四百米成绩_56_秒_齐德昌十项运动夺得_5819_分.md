Xinhua News Agency, September 16th. Zhejiang Province's renowned sprinter Jiang Yumin broke her own national record of 56.6 seconds in the women's 400 meters this morning with a time of 56 seconds, and also won the championship in this final.

	This is the first national best performance to appear on the track and field of the Beijing Workers' Stadium. When the good news was announced by the loudspeaker, the audience burst into applause. The director of the National Games Track and Field and Cycling Competition Committee, the 78-year-old veteran sports figure Ma John, excitedly walked onto the field, shook hands with Jiang Yumin to congratulate her, and kindly encouraged her to continue her efforts and make further progress. He said, your "sprint" today was not strong enough, otherwise you could have created a better result.

	A total of eight athletes participated in the women's 400-meter final. Jiang Yumin, who is under 25 years old, began to stand out about 100 meters after the start and took the lead. Chen Jinrong, a 20-year-old athlete from Henan, chased closely, but Jiang Yumin ran forward with even strides and continued to lead to the finish line. Her steady and graceful steps repeatedly won the praise of the audience. Chen Jinrong, a newcomer who participated in such a large-scale national track and field competition for the first time, finished second with a time of 58.7 seconds. Third place was Xu Shizhang from Guizhou, with a time of 59.4 seconds.

Xinhua News Agency, September 16th. Good news came from the track and field competition of the First National Games again this afternoon: two athletes broke the national record for the men's decathlon; four athletes equaled two national records - the women's 100 meters and the men's 110-meter hurdles. Shandong athlete Zheng Fengrong jumped over 1.73 meters in the high jump competition of the women's triathlon, creating her best result since this year.

	Breaking the national record of 5,185 points in the men's decathlon were Shanghai athlete Qi Dechang (5,819 points) and Beijing athlete Yu Xinlu (5,488 points). The competition between these two athletes today was very fierce. When the eighth event (pole vault) was completed, Yu Xinlu's points (4,879 points) were still 98 points more than Qi Dechang's (4,781 points). At that time, Qi Dechang accidentally scratched his calf with spiked shoes, but he still insisted on participating in the competition and achieved a good result of 53.76 meters in the ninth event, the javelin, which increased his score to 5,382 points, not only exceeding Yu Xinlu's score in the first nine events (5,356 points) (Yu's javelin score was 47.16 meters), but also broke the national record of 5,185 points held by Yu Xinlu. Qi Dechang performed even better in the last event, the 1,500 meters (Qi's time was 4 minutes 37.3 seconds, and Yu Xinlu's time was 5 minutes 22.2 seconds), which greatly exceeded his national best score of 5,696 points created in May this year.

	The men's 800-meter final was very exciting. Shandong athlete Li Zhonglin was invited to participate in a performance today because he did not qualify for the final due to two false starts during the preliminary round on the 15th. He took the lead shortly after the start, but after running 700 meters, Yin Fengwu from Jilin suddenly took a big step forward and "sprinted" fiercely, finally reaching the finish line first with an advantage of 0.4 seconds, winning warm applause from the audience.

	Shandong athlete Zheng Fengrong won the women's triathlon (100 meters, shot put, high jump) competition today with a total score of 2,514 points, close to her national record of 2,570 points created last year. (Attached picture)

    姜玉民女子四百米成绩56秒
    齐德昌十项运动夺得5819分
　　据新华社16日讯　浙江省著名的短跑选手姜玉民今天上午以五十六秒的成绩，打破她自己保持的女子四百米五十六秒六的全国纪录，并且获得了这项决赛的冠军。
    这是北京工人体育场田径跑道上出现的第一个全国最高成绩。当这个喜讯由扩音器中传出以后，场上的观众掌声响成一片。全运会田径、自行车竞赛委员会主任、七十八岁的老体育家马约翰异常兴奋地走到运动场上，向姜玉民握手祝贺，并且亲切地鼓励她再接再厉，百尺竿头更进一步。他说，你今天的“冲刺”加劲还不够，不然还能创造更好的成绩。
    女子四百米决赛共有八名选手参加，不满二十五岁的姜玉民起跑后约百米处就开始脱颖而出，取得了领先的优势。河南二十岁的选手陈金荣紧紧追赶，但姜玉民均匀地大跨步疾驰前进，一直领先到终点。她那稳健而优美的步伐连连博得观众的赞扬。第一次参加这样大规模全国性田径赛的新手陈金荣以五十八秒七的成绩得第二。第三名是贵州徐世璋，成绩五十九秒四。
    据新华社16日讯　第一届全运会田径比赛16日下午又传出喜讯：有两名选手打破了男子十项运动的全国纪录；有四名选手平了两项——女子一百米和男子一百一十米高栏的全国纪录。山东选手郑凤荣在参加三项运动中的跳高比赛时，跳过了一米七十三，创造了她自己今年以来的最好成绩。
    打破男子十项运动五千一百八十五分全国纪录的是上海选手齐德昌（五千八百一十九分）和北京选手于新潞（五千四百八十八分）。这两名选手今天争夺十分激烈。当举行完第八项比赛（撑竿跳高）时，于新潞的积分（四千八百七十九分）还比齐德昌（四千七百八十一分）多九十八分。当时，齐德昌小腿不小心被钉鞋刮伤，但他仍然坚持参加比赛，并且在第九项标枪比赛中取得了五十三米七六的良好成绩，使积分增加为五千三百八十二分，不仅超过了于新潞前九项的积分（五千三百五十六分）（于的标枪成绩四十七米一六），而且还打破了于新潞保持的五千一百八十五分的全国纪录。齐德昌在最后一项一千五百米比赛中成绩更好（齐是四分三十七秒三，于新潞是五分二十二秒二），因而使最后的积分大大超过了他今年5月间创造的五千六百九十六分的全国最好成绩。
    男子八百米决赛十分精采。山东选手李忠林因15日预赛时两次抢跑犯规没能取得决赛权，今天应邀参加表演。他起跑后不久就取得了领先的地位，但跑了七百米后，吉林殷凤武突然大跨步向前猛烈“冲刺”，终于以快零点四秒的优势首先跑到终点，博得了全场观众的热烈掌声。
    山东选手郑凤荣今天在女子三项运动（一百米、铅球、跳高）比赛中获得了冠军，总分二千五百一十四分，接近她去年创造的二千五百七十分的全国纪录。（附图片）
