Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd: Following a comprehensive bumper harvest of summer crops, early autumn crops have also arrived in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province. The total output of the more than 400,000 mu of early rice in the region has more than doubled compared to last year, with both increased acreage and higher yields per mu. The 2.3 million mu of mid-season rice is beginning to ripen, with many large ears and full grains, promising a bumper harvest. More than 2.5 million mu of late rice is currently in the booting stage, with abundant seedlings, thick stalks, and vigorous growth. The more than 600,000 mu of cotton also has many fruit branches, buds, and bolls, and is growing well.

Suzhou Prefecture is backed by Taihu Lake and faces the Yangtze River, with a crisscrossing network of rivers. However, the old river channels did not separate flood control from drainage, and the water system was disorganized. After liberation, although small-scale water conservancy projects were extensively built, the region still had 10% of its cultivated land in high and dry areas prone to drought and 37% in low-lying areas prone to flooding. Last winter and this spring, due to the superior conditions brought about by communization, the region formulated a water management plan for the Taihu Lake basin, separating flood control from drainage and implementing tiered control. It unified the deployment of 400,000 water management workers and finally excavated the Taipu River and Wangyu River, dredged the Liu River and Zhangjiagang River, and built five large-scale sluice dams at the river mouths, completing more than 110 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, controlling the ports connecting to the river, and manipulating the water level of Taihu Lake. Although a severe drought was encountered this year, and water consumption was extremely high, these several dry rivers ingested large amounts of tidal water. Since the beginning of August, the ports along the river have introduced more than 400 million cubic meters of river water, replenishing the water source. At the same time, relying on the manpower and material resources of the communes, the development of mechanized and electrical drainage and irrigation was vigorously promoted, so that the mechanized and electrical drainage and irrigation area of the region reached 84% of the total rice area, with more than 59,000 horsepower of machinery replacing more than 500,000 laborers in pumping water, thereby ensuring that the land was not dry despite the drought, and a bumper harvest was achieved even in the face of an exceptionally severe drought.

Suzhou Prefecture has always been known for its intensive cultivation, but in the past, many places were limited in their ability to engage in intensive cultivation because there was more land than labor. After communization, on the one hand, collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens were established, allowing more than 500,000 female laborers to be put into agricultural production. On the other hand, labor was uniformly deployed and cooperation was organized, ensuring intensive cultivation even while engaging in large-scale farmland capital construction, and there was sufficient labor to combat a series of disasters such as drought, flooding, diseases, and insect pests. For example, this year, the drought situation, insect pests, fertilizer shortage, and third-class seedlings in the production teams of the Pingwang People's Commune in Wujiang County were very uneven. The commune party committee organized large-scale cooperation according to the principle of equal value exchange. The 22 production teams of the commune's joint brigade divided their forces into four routes: one route consisted of a strong labor force to form a drought-resistant army, using tools uniformly, irrigating day and night, and ensuring that the rice fields were never without water; one route consisted of an auxiliary labor force to form an insect control army, dividing the areas according to the severity of the insect pests, uniformly spraying medicine and setting lights, and contracting to eliminate diseases and insect pests; one route consisted of a rational combination of full labor force and semi-labor force to form a fertilizer accumulation professional team to salvage aquatic plants, cut dry grass, and collect miscellaneous fertilizers, rapidly compost fertilizer, and topdress fertilizer according to the seedling conditions; and one route focused on eliminating third-class seedlings, giving key processing and fertilization to third-class seedlings. In this way, the entire brigade, in three days, fought drought on 6,700 mu, irrigating every mu of rice field with sufficient water, catching more than 80,000 jin of moths and collecting egg masses, accumulating more than 30,000 dan of fertilizer, and more than 90 mu of third-class seedlings were also improved and upgraded.

Under the unified planning and leadership of the commune and the help of a series of measures, the face of many production teams with poor production foundations has also begun to change, promoting the gradual balanced development of agricultural production in the region. For example, there are 71 production brigades with poor foundations in Kunshan County. Under the unified leadership and specific assistance of the commune, the average yield per mu of wheat, barley, and yuan wheat increased by 42% this year, which is 5% higher than the average yield increase in the county. A total of 742 production brigades in the region had relatively poor production last year, and all of them have caught up with the production of the good teams this year. There are 1,690 production brigades that performed very well in production last year, and they are doing even better this year. In total, there are 2,432 brigades, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of brigades in the region, whose production this year has greatly exceeded that of last year.

### 寸土必争扩大面积　大兴水利降服旱魔  苏州专区早稻增产一倍  中稻穗多穗大子粒饱满丰收在望

    寸土必争扩大面积　大兴水利降服旱魔
    苏州专区早稻增产一倍
    中稻穗多穗大子粒饱满丰收在望
    据新华社南京3日电　江苏省苏州专区继夏熟作物全面丰收以后，早秋作物又已登场，全区四十多万亩早稻不仅单产比去年增加，而且面积扩大，总产量比去年增产一倍多。二百三十万亩中稻开始成熟，穗多穗大，子粒饱满，丰收在望。二百五十多万亩晚稻正在孕穗，苗多秆粗，生长健壮。六十多万亩棉花也是果枝多，蕾铃多，生长良好。
    苏州专区背靠太湖，面临长江，河网交错，但是老河道洪涝不分，水系零乱。解放以后，虽然大修小型水利，但是全区仍有占耕地面积10％的高亢易旱地区和37％的低洼易涝地区。去冬今春，由于公社化以后出现优越条件，全区制订了洪涝分治、分级控制的太湖流域的治水规划，统一调配了四十万治水大军，终于开挖了太浦河、望虞河，疏浚了浏河、张家港，并且在河口上修建了五座大型闸坝，先后做了一亿一千多万立方米土石工程，控制住通江港口，操纵住太湖水位。今年虽然遇到严重干旱，耗水量极大，但是这几条干河大量地吞进江潮，8月上旬以来沿江各港共引进四亿多立方米江水，补足了水源；同时，依靠公社的人力物力，大力发展机电排灌，使全区机电排灌面积达到水稻总面积84％，有五万九千多马力的机械代替五十多万劳动力车水，从而保证了天旱地不旱，特大干旱也丰收。
    苏州专区向以精耕细作著称，但是过去许多地方因为地多劳动力少，精耕细作受到一定限制。公社化以后，一方面兴办了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业，使五十多万妇女劳动力投入农业生产；一方面统一调配劳力和组织协作，在大搞农田基本建设的情况下，仍然保证精耕细作，并且有充足的劳动力来战胜旱、涝、病、虫等一系列灾害。例如今年吴江县平望人民公社各大队生产队旱象、虫害、缺肥和三类苗情况都很不平衡，公社党委按等价交换原则组织了大协作。公社联合大队的二十二个生产队，就是兵分四路，一路由强劳动力组成抗旱大军，统一使用工具，日夜灌水，做到片片稻田不断水；一路由辅助劳动力组成治虫大军，按虫害轻重程度划圩分片，统一喷药点灯，包干扑灭病虫害；一路由整劳动力和半劳动力合理搭配，组成捞水草、割旱草、收集杂肥的积肥专业队伍，快速沤肥，按苗情分别追肥；一路突击消灭三类苗，给三类苗重点加工施肥。这样，全大队在三天时间里，就抗旱六千七百亩，亩亩稻田灌足了水，捕蛾采卵八万多斤，积聚肥料三万多担，九十多亩三类苗也已转好升级。
    在公社的统一规划领导和一系列措施的帮助下，许多原来生产基础差的生产队的面貌也开始改变，促使全区农业生产逐步平衡发展。例如昆山县有七十一个基础较差的生产大队，在公社的统一领导和具体帮助下，今年小麦、大麦、元麦平均亩产量增长42％，比全县平均增产幅度高5％。全专区共有七百四十二个生产大队去年生产较差，今年都已赶上生产好的队。有一千六百九十个生产大队去年生产搞得很好，今年搞得更好。两者合计，共有二千四百三十二个大队，占全区大队总数80％以上，今年生产大大超过了去年。
