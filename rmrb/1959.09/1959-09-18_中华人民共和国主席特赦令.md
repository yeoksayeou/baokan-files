Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the people of all ethnic groups in our country, our socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great victories after ten years of heroic struggle. Our motherland is thriving, production and construction are booming, and people's lives are improving day by day. The people's democratic dictatorship is unprecedentedly consolidated and powerful. The political consciousness and organizational level of the people of the whole country have been raised to an unprecedented height. The political and economic situation of the country is extremely good. The policy of combining punishment with leniency, and combining labor reform with ideological education, implemented by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government towards counter-revolutionaries and other criminals has achieved great success. The majority of various criminals in custody have been reformed to varying degrees, and many have indeed turned over a new leaf. In order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, to celebrate the victory of the general line of socialist construction of the Chinese Communist Party, and to celebrate the brilliant achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune Movement, according to the decision of the Ninth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress, a special amnesty is granted to war criminals of the Chiang Kai-shek Group and the Puppet Manchurian Regime, counter-revolutionary criminals and ordinary criminal offenders who have genuinely turned over a new leaf.

	I. War criminals of the Chiang Kai-shek Group and the Puppet Manchurian Regime who have been detained for ten years and have genuinely turned over a new leaf shall be released.

	II. Counter-revolutionary criminals who have been sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of five years or less (including five years), have served more than one-half of their sentence, and have genuinely turned over a new leaf; those sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than five years, have served more than two-thirds of their sentence, and have genuinely turned over a new leaf shall be released.

	III. Ordinary criminal offenders who have been sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of five years or less (including five years), have served more than one-third of their sentence, and have genuinely turned over a new leaf; those sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of more than five years, have served more than one-half of their sentence, and have genuinely turned over a new leaf shall be released.

	IV. Criminals sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve who have served more than one year of the reprieve and have genuinely shown repentance can be commuted to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than fifteen years.

	V. Criminals sentenced to life imprisonment who have served more than seven years and have genuinely shown repentance can be commuted to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years.

	This order shall be executed by the Supreme People's Court and the Higher People's Courts.
