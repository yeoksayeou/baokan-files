First of all, I have the honor to express, on behalf of our delegation and the Communist Party of Denmark, our sincere gratitude for your kind invitation to visit your great country and participate in the grand National Day celebration, and to extend our fraternal and heartfelt festive greetings to the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, congratulating you on the very great achievements you have made so far, and wishing you all the best on the road ahead.

We come from a small country, where unfortunately we have not yet begun to build socialism. At present, our most important political task is, first and foremost, to awaken our Danish people to oppose with greater efforts than in the past the attempts of the reactionaries, who are trying to turn our territory into a military outpost of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's war machine, aimed at the socialist world. To put it plainly, this refers to the reactionaries in our country who support foreign reactionary forces that want foreign troops stationed in our country and atomic missiles placed on our territory.

We believe that our party, together with other progressive forces, is capable of launching a powerful popular movement to prevent this from happening. We believe that this movement can succeed, just as we successfully aroused the Danish people to resist and fight against the Nazi oppressors who occupied our country during the Second World War.

I could say a lot more about this; but here I want to say something else.

We flew to Beijing from distant Denmark. The journey from there to here is very long, and when we get up here in the morning, our compatriots at home are going to sleep. After flying for an hour or two, we flew over the border between the capitalist world and the socialist world. After that, we continued to fly for many hours, in an excellent jet aircraft, which travels at almost a thousand kilometers per hour, and which is also one of the achievements of Soviet technology and science. Below us—for all these many hours—was the socialist world. First the Soviet Union, then the Mongolian People's Republic, and finally the People's Republic of China. We flew over the vast socialist world—and we have not yet reached its end—in this world, millions of people live, work, and build a happy life, building a peaceful world, a world of socialism and communism.

Dear comrades and friends, why am I saying these things now that everyone knows? Because this understanding fills the members of our delegation from a part of the capitalist world with wonderful feelings—feelings of the greatness and strength of the socialist world.

Our people are peace-loving. Many of our beautiful folk songs repeatedly express this desire for peace. Our delegation knows that if we want to maintain peace—peace must be maintained, and if we want to realize the proposition of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition—this proposition must be realized, the actual background and guarantee of success must be found in the greatness and strength of this vast socialist world that we have flown over.

Because we are communists from a small country, and therefore members of a small communist party, we were very happy to hear the Soviet and Chinese comrades say in their welcoming speeches that whether we come from a small party or a large party, we belong to the same family. That is indeed the case. It is so, and it is a good thing.

I am an adult now, but I also went through childhood, so I know that although people learn to speak and walk on their own legs without the help of others, there will always be certain situations in which it is best to have an older brother who can give you advice, teach you, and protect you when peaceful family life is threatened from outside.

For many years we have had an older brother, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and now we have several older brothers. Among these older brothers, the great Chinese Communist Party occupies a prominent position, and we are very happy about it.

Long live international proletarian solidarity!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the People's Republic of China! (Attached picture)

    丹麦共产党中央委员会政治局委员、丹麦共产党代表团团长
    罗伯特·萨尔陶里同志的贺词
    首先，我荣幸地代表我们代表团、代表丹麦共产党对你们盛情邀请我们访问你们伟大的国家和参加伟大的国庆节庆典，致热烈的谢意，并向中国人民和中国共产党致兄弟的、衷心的节日祝贺，祝贺你们迄今取得的非常伟大的成就，并预祝你们在继续前进的道路上万事如意。
    我们来自一个小国，在那个国家不幸我们还没有开始建设社会主义。目前我们最重要的政治任务，首先就是唤起我们丹麦人民以比过去更大的努力来反对反动派的企图，他们企图把我国领土变成矛头指向社会主义世界的北大西洋公约组织战争机器的军事前哨，说得明白些，这指的就是我国的那些支持想让外国军队驻扎我国、想在我国领土上设置原子导弹的国外反动势力的反动分子。
    我们认为，我们党跟其他进步力量一道是能够掀起一个声势浩大的人民运动来阻止这种事情发生的。我们认为，这个运动是能够成功的，正如在第二次世界大战期间我们成功地唤起了丹麦人民对于占领我国的纳粹压迫者进行抵抗、进行斗争一样。
    关于这一方面，我还可以说很多；但是在这里我想说另外的事情。
    我们是从遥远的丹麦乘飞机到北京的。从那里到这里路途非常遥远，当我们早晨在这里起床的时候，我们国内的同胞却要睡觉了。飞行了一两个钟头，我们飞过了资本主义世界和社会主义世界之间的边界线。此后我们继续飞行了许多小时，我们乘的是一架出色的喷气飞机，这架飞机时速几乎达一千公里，而且它也是苏联技术和科学的成就之一。在我们下面——在所有这许多小时之中——是社会主义世界。首先是苏联，接着是蒙古人民共和国，最后是中华人民共和国。我们飞过了辽阔的社会主义世界——而且我们还没有飞到它的尽头——在这个世界中，千百万人民生活着、工作着、建设着幸福的生活，建设着一个和平世界、一个社会主义和共产主义世界。
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们，我为什么现在要说这样一些大家都知道的话呢？因为这种了解使我们这个来自资本主义世界一部分的代表团的团员们心中充满了奇妙的感情——体会到社会主义世界的伟大和力量的感情。
    我们的人民是爱和平的。我们的许多美丽的民族歌曲就反复表达了这种要和平的愿望。我们代表团知道，如果要维护和平——和平是必须维护的，如果要实现和平共处和和平竞赛的主张——这个主张是必须实现的，取得成功的实际背景和保证就要在我们所飞越的这个辽阔的社会主义世界的伟大和力量中寻找。
    因为我们是一个小国的共产党人，因此是一个小共产党的党员，当听到苏联和中国同志们在他们的欢迎词中说，无论我们来自一个小党还是来自一个大党，我们都属于同一个家庭的时候，我们感到很高兴。诚然是这样的。是这样，也是一件好事。
    我现在是一个大人了，但是我也曾经经过童年时代，因此，我知道，虽然人是不用别人帮助就学会说话、学会用自己的腿走路的，但是也不断会产生某种情况，在这种情况下，最好是有一个大哥，他能够向你提出忠告，能够教导你，而且在和平的家庭生活受到外来威胁时他又能够保护你。
    许多年来我们就有一个大哥即苏联共产党，而现在我们有了若干个大哥了。在这些大哥中，伟大的中国共产党占有一个突出的地位，我们感到很高兴。
    国际无产阶级团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！（附图片）
