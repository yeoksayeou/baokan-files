    Song of Log Rafting on the Border River
    Korean Worker
      Cui Yunxue
    Under Changbai Mountain, lumberjacks float logs, rafting workers sing loudly.
    Changsen Ridge twists and turns, the mountain peaks rise and fall endlessly.
    The log raft floats past the riverside village, the rice paddies on the shore ripple green,
    The Tumen River, oh, the scenery is beautiful, oak leaves cover the stone reefs.
    How many revolutionary dreams are buried under the rocks;
    There are many Red Flag River relics on the shore, revolutionary stories transform the landscape,
    The guerrillas' shouts still linger in my ears.
    The Japanese devil Maeda's troops were completely annihilated here,
    Thinking of that heroic scene, it seems just like yesterday.
    The motherland's border is so beautiful, the long waterway has no end,
    The log raft, oh, rushes down thousands of miles, riding the wind and waves;
    On the fertile fields behind Mount Junjian, the orioles sing heartily,
    Thousands of miles of mountains and rivers, strange rocks and bizarre stones are closely connected,
    The log raft floats to Kai Shankou, lumber for socialist construction is piled up like Mount Tai.

    边江流筏歌
    朝鲜族工人
      崔云学长白山下放木排，流筏工人唱高歌。长森岭曲折弯转，山峰起伏数不完。木排流过江村边，岸上稻田碧浪翻，图们江哟风光好，柞树叶遮盖石礁。多少革命的梦想，都在岩石下埋葬；红旗河岸遗迹多，革命故事变山河，游击队员的呐喊，依然萦绕在耳边。日本鬼前田部队，全部歼灭在这里，想起那壮烈情景，仿佛和昨天一样。祖国边疆多锦绣，遥遥水路无尽头，木排哟一泻千里，乘风破浪向下放；军舰山后沃野上，黄莺纵情把歌唱，山山水水几千里，奇石怪岩紧相连，木排流到开山口，建设社会主义的木材像泰山般堆起来。
