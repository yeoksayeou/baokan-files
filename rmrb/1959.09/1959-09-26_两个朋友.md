A Decade of Praise

    Two Friends
    Wu Han

    This decade, a decade where one day is equal to twenty years, a decade that marks a new era in Chinese history, a glorious and splendid decade, a decade where the entire nation rejoices, a decade where everyone undergoes changes, from lifestyle habits to ideological awareness, delightful changes worthy of praise.

    I know many people, each of whom has undergone delightful changes, whether great or small, but in any case, they have changed, and in any case, it is delightful. Among them, two friends have changed the most and the greatest.

    These two friends are both older than me. When I was in university, they had already been professors for many years. Both were returned students from overseas, very Westernized. One studied philosophy, taught logic, and even wrote books on logic, so his nickname was "Logic." The other studied architecture and spent his life researching ancient Chinese architecture. When he talked about things like the thousand-year-old wooden structure of Mount Wutai, Li Jie's *Yingzao Fashi*, etc., he would be animated and never stop talking. Although he was an authority in this field, he seemed not to have built any large buildings in the old days, probably because there were simply no large buildings to build in that era, and also because he wanted to talk about national forms, but people didn't like that. Therefore, his theory remained only a theory, although he wrote many articles, he built very few houses.

    I didn't take their classes, but later I taught at the same school and was considered a colleague, so I took advantage of it and considered them friends, and they were too embarrassed to act like teachers.

    Let's start with the recent past.

    About a month ago, Professor Logic suddenly called, asking if I had time, he wanted to talk about a problem. Of course, I welcomed him, but I was puzzled, what was it? I guessed for a long time, maybe it was a few things that we both had something to do with? But I was completely wrong, it wasn't that at all.

    He was about sixty years old, wearing a short-sleeved shirt and shorts. If it weren't for his white hair, people would have thought he was an athlete! As soon as he sat down, he explained his purpose.

    He said: Isn't there a recent promotion to develop the production of non-staple foods? I thought of raising chickens. I want to talk to you about it.

    I was a little strange, why come to me about raising chickens? Did he want to find some anecdotes about ancient chicken raising? But as soon as I listened, it was wrong, it turned out he was suggesting castrating chickens.

    "You know, castration of chickens is very common in southern China. Every year in July and August, young roosters weighing about half a catty have to be castrated. During that season, some experts travel around villages. With a small bow and a small knife, they catch the young roosters on the spot, make a small incision next to the ribs, twist the bowstring inward, and squeeze out a small white ball, then feel the feathers, and put it on the ground, and the young rooster will jump and bounce again, looking for food. Very simple, isn't it? This way, it grows fat and tender, and it's still very delicious even when it weighs three or four catties."

    I said: "I've seen it, it's really convenient."

    He said: "Then why isn't this method popular in Beijing? It seems that chicken castration is not very common in the Henan, Hebei, and Shandong regions. They are eaten when they weigh a catty or so, and they become too old and not delicious when they grow up. Now, every commune, every team, every family is raising chickens. You calculate, if one chicken is castrated, it can grow two or three catties more, ten thousand, million, ten million chickens, you calculate, how much meat will grow, twenty or thirty million catties! Isn't it?"

    I said: "Your calculation is good, it makes sense."

    He said: "Then why don't you promote it? If you don't know how, invite a few people from the south to open a training class, and then go to the communes to teach, wouldn't it increase the amount of meat every year?"

    I came for this.

    After he finished speaking, he wiped his sweat and left.

    This conversation moved me greatly.

    This is the same person who told me a few months ago that he had been engaged in logic for many years, a set of idealistic, bourgeois stuff. After being engaged in it for many years, he himself couldn't figure out what he was doing. The task from now on is to criticize this set of stuff, to criticize his own past works. Study Marxism-Leninism, study materialistic philosophy.

    This is also the same person. Ten years ago, we were organizing a declaration against something. At that time, we opposed the Kuomintang, but we didn't know anything, we only knew how to issue declarations and find people to sign, the more the better. I went to him. During the ten-minute break after class, he quickly looked at it and said, "I'll sign, I'll sign," and picked up a pen to write. When I looked at it, I was in trouble. He wrote half an ear, because the previous person who signed was named Chen, and he was also writing the word Chen. I quickly stopped him and said, "No, write your own name." He then realized and kept saying, "My name is not Chen, my name is not Chen," and correctly signed his name.

    As for that professor of architecture, although he didn't forget his surname, he was also very interesting.

    His health was not good, and his weight was only forty-odd kilograms at the lowest. After raising himself well, he finally gained a few kilograms, but when he got busy, he forgot that he was a sick person, and he collapsed again, and consumed those few kilograms again, and became as thin as a monkey. Leaning on a cane, hunching his back, he ran around all day long.

    To talk about him, we have to go back to 1948.

    At the end of that year, the People's Liberation Army surrounded the city of Beiping. They sent an officer to find him and ask him to draw up the ancient cultural relics and buildings that needed to be protected in the city of Beiping, so that in case they had to open fire, these ancient cultural relics and buildings would not be damaged by artillery fire.

    This event deeply moved and educated this expert. In March 1949, after I returned to Beiping, he said to me with gratitude: "Tell me, what kind of fighting in the world's history is like this! Look, look, how much importance and care is given to cultural heritage! This is truly the people's army! The people's army!"

    From then on, he deeply admired the Communist Party and loved the Communist Party.

    However, his research on ancient architecture became a burden. He loved ancient architecture too much. According to his opinion, in order to preserve the ancient style and structural system of Beijing, new buildings and new centers should be placed in the western suburbs, outside Fuxingmen. In the future, the old and new would coexist and be interconnected.

    From then on, a heated debate unfolded.

    He loved the ancient pailou arches, and he loved the ancient city walls. He believed that the roads were too long, and that having pailou arches in the center of the road would give people a sense of comfort in spirit. He suggested building a ring-city park on the city walls, planting flowers and plants, etc., for people to visit. In short, in the discussion of demolishing the pailou arches and city walls, he insisted on his own opinion, listing various reasons, and was determined to coexist with the pailou arches and city walls.

    After arguing for several years, the problem was resolved. Beijing was rebuilt on the original basis. The pailou arches on the main trunk lines were demolished, and many gaps were opened in the city walls, facilitating traffic inside and outside the city.

    With his knowledge as an expert in ancient architecture, he actively participated in the reconstruction and new construction work in Beijing.

    In the anti-Rightist struggle, both he and Professor Logic were active anti-Rightists. They resolutely struggled, ruthlessly exposed, and were tested and tempered.

    These two friends have successively joined the Communist Party and are advancing on the road to becoming both red and expert.

    These two friends received a bourgeois education and each had their own systematic theories of idealistic philosophy and architecture. They taught for a lifetime, wrote many works, and are both around sixty years old. However, they are both determined to abandon the old ways, discard their many years of expertise, re-study, and start from scratch. Moreover, they are determined to criticize some of their past erroneous theories in their studies. Neither of them admits to being old, or even believes they are old. Both hope to live for a few more decades and do more things for the motherland and make achievements. I say that among many friends, these two have changed the most and the greatest. I also believe that they will continue to undergo greater changes and greater improvements, and make beneficial contributions to academic research.

    When we see someone virtuous, we should think of emulating them. I want to learn from these two old friends. I also believe that many friends in the academic community will also learn from them.

    People can change. Old intellectuals can become new intellectuals, and bourgeois intellectuals can become proletarian intellectuals through the education of the Party and through self-education and self-transformation. "They are also human beings," "They are also old intellectuals," "They are also bourgeois intellectuals," so why can't we? We certainly can, friends, isn't that right?

专栏：十年颂歌

    两个朋友
    吴晗
    这十年，一天等于二十年的十年，中国历史划时代的十年，光辉灿烂的十年，全国人民欢欣鼓舞的十年，人人发生变化，从生活习惯到思想意识的变化，可喜的可以歌咏的变化。
    我认识不少人，每个人都发生或多或少可喜的变化，不管多也吧，少也吧，总之是变了的，总之是可喜的。其中变得最多最大的有两个朋友。
    这两个朋友，年纪都比我大，当我在大学念书时，他们已当了多年教授了。两个人都是留学生，洋气很重，一个学哲学，教逻辑，也写过讲逻辑的书，外号就叫逻辑。一个学建筑，一辈子研究中国古建筑，谈起什么五台山有一千年历史的木结构，李诫的营造法式等等，便眉飞色舞，说个没完。虽然他在这一行是个权威，但似乎在旧时代没盖过什么大房子，大概是一来那时代根本没有什么大房子盖，二来他要讲民族形式，人家不喜欢这一套，因之，他的理论也终于只是理论而已，虽然文章写得很多，房子却盖得极少。
    我没有上过他们的课，后来也在同一学校教书，算同事了，因之也就占点光，算是朋友，他们也不好意思摆老师架子。
    还是从最近讲起吧。
    大约一个多月前吧，逻辑教授突然来电话，问有时间没有，他要来谈一个问题，我当然欢迎他来，但是心头纳闷，是什么事呢？猜了好久，大概是我俩都有关系的几件事吧？谁知大谬不然，完全不是那回事。
    六十左右的人了，穿着短汗衫短裤，假如不是那头白发，人家会以为是个运动健将呢！一坐下便说明来意。
    他说：近来不是在提倡发展副食品的生产吗？我想到养鸡。要和你谈谈。
    我有点奇怪，养鸡怎么来找我，难道要找点什么古代养鸡的掌故不成。一听又不对头，原来他提议阉鸡。
    “你知道，我们南方阉鸡很普遍，每年7、8月间，半斤来重的公鸡就得阉。那季节就有一些专家巡行村落，一个小弓，一把小刀，就地捉住小公鸡，在肋骨旁拉一个小口子，弓弦向里一绞，夹出一个小白球，再摸摸毛，放在地下，小公鸡就又跳跳蹦蹦，找吃去了。很简便，不是吗？这样，长得肥，长得嫩，到三四斤重还是很好吃。”
    我说：“我见过，果然省事。”
    他说：“那为什么北京不兴这个办法呢？河南、河北、山东这一地区好像都不大阉鸡。斤把来重就吃了，长大肉老了不好吃。如今，个个公社，个个队，家家都在养鸡。你算，一个鸡阉了可以多长两三斤，十万，百万，千万个鸡，你算，得长多少肉，两三千万斤啊！不是吗？”
    我说：你的账算得不错，有道理。
    他说：那你们为什么不提倡呢？要是不会，从南方请几个人来，开个训练班，再到各公社去传授，不是就可以每年增加多少肉食吗？
    我就是为这个来的。
    说完了，他就抹一抹汗，走了。
    这一场谈话使我很感动。
    就是这个人，几个月前他对我说，过去多年搞逻辑，唯心的，资产阶级的一套，搞了多年，连自己也弄不清楚到底搞的是什么。今后的任务是批判这一套，批判自己过去的著作。学习马克思列宁主义，学习唯物主义的哲学。
    也就是这个人，十年前，有一次我们搞一个反对什么的宣言，那时候，我们这些人反对国民党，但是什么也不会，只会发宣言，找人签名，人越多越好。我找了他，在下课休息的十分钟里，他匆匆看了，说我签我签，拿起笔就写。我一看，糟了，他写了半个耳朵，原来上一个签名的人姓陈，他也在写陈字了，我赶忙拦住，说不对，写你自己的名字吧。他才醒悟过来，连说，我不姓陈，我不姓陈，正确地签上自己的名字。
    那个建筑教授呢？虽不至于忘记自己的姓，却也非常有趣。
    他身体不好，体重最低时只有四十多公斤。养好了，好容易长了几公斤，一忙，忙到忘记自己是个病号，就又垮了，又把那几公斤消耗掉，瘦得像个猴子。支一根手杖，弓着背，成天满处跑。
    说他，得倒回来说，从1948年说起。
    那年年底，解放军包围了北平城。派了一个军官找他，要他画出北平城必需要保护的古文物建筑，以便万一不得已开炮时，这些古文物建筑不致被炮火损坏。
    这件事深深感动了教育了这位专家。1949年3月间，我回到北平以后，他带着感激的心情对我说：“你说，世界上历史上那有这样打仗的！你看，你看，对文化遗产这样重视，这样爱惜！这真是人民的军队！人民的军队！”
    从此以后，他深深敬佩共产党，爱戴共产党。
    但是，他的古建筑研究成了包袱，他对古建筑太热爱了，照他的意见，为了保存北京城的古老风格和结构体系，新的建筑，新的中心应该摆在西郊，复兴门以外地区，将来新旧并存，互相联系。
    从此，展开了热烈的争论。
    他喜爱古老的牌坊，他喜爱古老的城墙。他认为马路太长了，有了路中心的牌坊，会使人在精神上得到舒适的感觉。他建议在城墙上建环城公园，种些花草之类，供人游览等等。总之，在拆除牌坊和城墙的讨论中，他坚持己见，列举种种理由，大有和牌坊、城墙共存亡的决心。
    吵了几年，问题解决了。北京在原有基础上改建，主要干线的牌坊都拆掉了，城墙也开了许多缺口，便利了城内外的交通。
    他以古建筑专家的知识，积极参加了北京的改建和新建工作。
    在反右派斗争中，他和逻辑教授都是反右派的积极分子。坚决斗争，无情揭露，受到了考验，锻炼。
    这两个朋友先后都参加了共产党，向红专道路前进。
    这两个朋友受的是资产阶级教育，都有一套自成体系的唯心主义的哲学和建筑学的理论，教了一辈子书，写了不少著作，并且都是六十岁左右的人了。但是，都坚决放弃老一套，丢掉多年来的看家本领，重新学习，从头做起，并且，决心要在学习中批判自己过去的某些错误理论。都不服老，甚至都不承认老，都希望能再活几十年，多为祖国作些事，做出成绩来。我说，在许多朋友中，变得最多最大的就是这两个，我还相信，他们将会继续起更大的变化，更多的提高，在学术研究上作出有益的贡献。
    见贤思齐，我要向这两个老朋友学习。我也相信，学术界的许多朋友也会向他们学习。
    人是可以变的。旧知识分子是可以变成新知识分子的，资产阶级知识分子是可以通过党的教育通过自我教育自我改造，成为无产阶级知识分子的。“彼亦人耳”，“彼亦旧知识分子耳”，“彼亦资产阶级知识分子耳”，为什么我们就不可以呢？一定可以，朋友们说是不是？
