Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Chairman Zhu De held a banquet at Ziguang Pavilion in Zhongnanhai this evening, warmly welcoming Panchen Erdeni Chökyi Gyaltsen, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Vice Chairmen Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal Living Buddha and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, who have come to participate in the celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Chairman Zhu De said at the banquet that the situation in our country is very good, and the whole country is full of joy, encouragement, prosperity and strength. Like all other parts of the country, the situation in Tibet is also very good. No matter how the imperialists, foreign reactionaries, and Tibetan upper-class reactionary elements who have fled abroad clamor, the Tibetan people and all ethnic groups in the country will unite more closely and march victoriously towards the great socialist goal.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the banquet. He raised his glass at the banquet to congratulate the victory of suppressing the rebellion in Tibet, the beginning of democratic reform in Tibet, and the unity and victory of all ethnic groups in the motherland's big family. Premier Zhou also proposed a toast to the health of Panchen Erdeni, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal and Apip Awang Jinmei, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as the Tibetan compatriots present.

Chairman Zhu De delivered a speech at the beginning of the banquet, warmly welcoming Panchen Erdeni and other responsible personnel from Tibet such as Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme.

Chairman Zhu De said: Due to the swift suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique instigated by imperialists and foreign reactionaries, the Tibetan people have begun a new era. Not long ago, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held its second plenary session and adopted a resolution on carrying out democratic reforms throughout Tibet. This resolution embodies the Party and the State's policy of carrying out democratic reforms in Tibet, conforms to the long-standing and urgent aspirations of the Tibetan working people, and is not only warmly supported by the vast number of people in Tibet, but also approved by patriotic figures in the upper strata of Tibet.

He said: At present, under the leadership of the Party and under the direction of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region headed by Panchen Erdeni, the broad masses of the people in the Tibetan region are carrying out a vigorous democratic reform movement. This movement will thoroughly shatter the evil serf system that has cruelly oppressed the Tibetan people for thousands of years, and open up broad prospects for the prosperity and development of the Tibetan region.

Chairman Zhu De finally emphasized that in the unified multi-ethnic family of the motherland, the hardworking and brave Tibetan people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, will resolutely complete the democratic reforms and gradually build the Tibetan region into a happy socialist paradise.

Panchen Erdeni then spoke. He said with full confidence: Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Tibetan people, like other ethnic groups, will complete the democratic reforms rapidly through their own hard work and with the strong support of all ethnic groups, especially the Han elder brothers, and gradually enter a beautiful socialist society.

He said: The Tibetan region of the motherland, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, is advancing along a bright path, just like other regions of the country. The counter-revolutionary armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique in March this year has been basically quelled. With the victory of the pacification of the rebellion in Tibet, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses has risen to an unprecedented height, and a tremendous democratic reform movement is being carried out rapidly and vigorously in the vast areas of Tibet.

He said: The second plenary session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held in July this year, after carefully studying the development of the situation in the Tibetan region, unanimously agreed that carrying out democratic reforms throughout Tibet is precisely the urgent desire of the Tibetan working people to be completely liberated. The meeting unanimously adopted the resolution on carrying out democratic reforms throughout Tibet. The broad masses of monks and lay people unanimously supported the resolution and, under the guidance of the resolution, rapidly and extensively launched the "three antis and two reductions" movement against rebellion, against corvee labor, against enslavement, and for rent reduction and interest reduction in agricultural areas.

Panchen Erdeni said: Under the situation where the "three antis and two reductions" are gradually being completed, the vast number of serfs and slaves in Tibet are urgently demanding the abolition of the feudal serf owners' land ownership system and the implementation of the farmers' land ownership system. Now the consciousness of the broad masses of the people has been raised to an unprecedented level, and all patriotic and progressive upper-class figures and the broad masses of monks unanimously and enthusiastically support the thorough abolition of the feudal serf system and the various oppressions and exploitations of the masses by the temples. And they all agreed that doing so is in line with the wishes of the broad masses of monks and lay people in Tibet. The serfs, who had been working hard all year round but lived like cattle and horses, stood up and righteously made a just call: "We want to be the masters of the land, not slaves of the land," and they successively accused the cruel feudal serf system of its crimes. With high fighting spirit, they firmly demanded the rapid realization of land reform. The broad masses of the people sang the praises of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and their own new life. They happily said, "The dark clouds have dissipated and the sun has risen," "The days of suffering are over, and the days of happiness have begun." The Tibetan people rejoiced that they had embarked on a splendid road.

Jan Tung Gyaltsen, Lhalu Tsewong Dorje, Sampo Tenzin, Ngawang Jimpa, standing committee members of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Panchen Erdeni's family members and entourage all attended the banquet.

Tonight, Vice Premiers He Long, Ulanhu, and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman Li Weihan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Deputy Directors of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao, Yang Jingren, and Xie Hechou, Deputy Secretaries of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC Tan Guansan and Zhou Renshan, as well as heads of various departments of state organs, the Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and people from all walks of life in the capital, attended the banquet as guests.

After the banquet, a welcome evening party was held. (Attached photo)

    新华社25日讯　朱德委员长今晚在中南海紫光阁举行宴会，热烈欢迎前来参加建国十周年国庆大典的西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞和副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰活佛、副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美。朱德委员长在宴会上讲话说，我国的情况是非常良好的，全国到处是一片欢腾鼓舞和繁荣昌盛的景象。同全国各地一致，西藏的情况也是非常良好的。不管帝国主义、外国反动派和逃亡国外的西藏上层反动分子如何叫嚣，西藏人民和全国各族人民将更加紧密地团结一致，大踏步地朝着伟大的社会主义目标胜利前进。
    周恩来总理出席了宴会。他在宴会上举杯致词，祝贺西藏平息叛乱的胜利，祝贺西藏民主改革的开始，祝贺祖国大家庭各族人民的团结和胜利。周总理并提议为全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长班禅额尔德尼和政协全国委员会副主席帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、阿沛·阿旺晋美，以及在座的藏族同胞的健康干杯。
    朱德委员长在宴会开始时讲话，热烈欢迎班禅额尔德尼和帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、阿沛·阿旺晋美等西藏负责人员。
    朱德委员长说：由于迅速平定了西藏上层反动集团在帝国主义、外国反动派策动下的反革命叛乱，西藏人民开始了一个新的纪元。不久前，根据中央的指示，西藏自治区筹备委员会召开了第二次全体会议，通过了在西藏全区进行民主改革的决议。这个决议，体现了党和国家在西藏进行民主改革的政策，符合西藏劳动人民长期以来的迫切愿望，这个决议不仅受到西藏广大人民的热烈拥护，也得到西藏的上层爱国人士的赞成。
    他说：目前，在党的领导下和在班禅额尔德尼为首的西藏自治区筹备委员会主持下，西藏地区的广大人民正在开展一个轰轰烈烈的民主改革运动。这个运动将彻底粉碎千百年来残酷压迫西藏人民的万恶的农奴制度，为西藏地区的繁荣发展开辟广阔的前途。
    朱德委员长最后强调说：在统一的祖国各民族大家庭中，勤劳勇敢的西藏人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，一定会坚决地完成民主改革，一定会逐步地把西藏地区建设成为幸福的社会主义乐园。
    班禅额尔德尼接着讲话。他满怀信心地说：在党和毛主席的领导下，西藏人民将和其他各族人民一样，将通过自己的干劲，并在各民族人民特别是汉族老大哥的大力支持下，迅速完成民主改革，并逐步进入社会主义美满社会。
    他说：祖国西藏地方在党和毛主席的领导下，同全国其它地区一样，正沿着光明的道路前进着。西藏上层反动集团在今年3月间发动的反革命武装叛乱，已经基本平定。随着西藏平叛的胜利，群众的革命热情空前地高涨起来，一个翻天复地的民主改革运动，正在西藏广大地区轰轰烈烈地迅速的开展了。
    他说：今年7月间举行的西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议，认真研究了西藏地区形势的发展情况以后，一致认为在西藏全区进行民主改革，正是西藏劳动人民要求彻底解放的迫切愿望。会议一致通过了在西藏全区进行民主改革的决议。广大僧俗人民一致拥护决议，并在决议的指导下，迅速而广泛的在农业地区展开了反叛乱、反乌拉差役、反奴役和减租减息的三反双减运动。
    班禅额尔德尼说：在三反双减逐步完成的形势下，西藏广大农奴和奴隶们，迫切要求废除封建农奴主的土地所有制，实行农民的土地所有制。现在广大人民的觉悟空前提高了，所有爱国进步的上层人士和广大僧众，一致热烈拥护彻底废除封建农奴制度和寺庙对群众的各种压榨与剥削。并一致认为这样做，是符合西藏广大僧俗人民的意愿的。过去终年辛勤劳苦却过着牛马生活的农奴站起来了，他们理直气壮地发出正义的呼声：“我们要做土地的主人，不愿做土地的奴隶”，纷纷控诉残酷的封建农奴制度的罪恶，斗志昂扬，坚决要求迅速实现土地改革。广大人民歌颂共产党，歌颂毛主席，歌颂自己的新生。他们欢天喜地的说：“乌云消散了，太阳升起了”，“苦难的日子到头了，幸福的生活开始了。”西藏人民欢欣自己已走上了灿烂的大道。
