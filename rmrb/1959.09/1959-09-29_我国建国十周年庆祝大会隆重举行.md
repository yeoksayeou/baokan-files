    Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: The grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China was solemnly held this afternoon in the magnificent Great Hall of the People. Representatives of all ethnic groups in China gathered with distinguished guests from the five continents to warmly celebrate the ten years of brilliant achievements of New China and to cheer for the great unity of the Chinese people and the great unity of the world's people.

    More than 10,000 people attended today's meeting. The venue was decorated solemnly and simply. In the center of the rostrum, against the light brown curtain, hung a huge golden national emblem, with the golden characters "1949-1959" on either side. The front of the stage was filled with flowers. A huge red star shone brightly from the top of the Great Hall, surrounded by hundreds of bright lights like stars in the sky, illuminating the entire venue. The atmosphere was filled with joy, friendship, and unity.

    At 3:40 PM, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China Liu Shaoqi, and other Party and state leaders, including Soong Ching Ling, Dong Biwu, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Lin Biao, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, etc., together with the leading comrades of the Soviet Union and socialist countries' party and government delegations, Suslov, Ho Chi Minh, Novotný, Kim Il-sung, Tsedenbal, Zawadzki, Dobi, Ganev, Shehu, Matern, Bodnăraș, etc., ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the entire audience stood up, and a storm of applause lasted for five minutes.

    Also invited to the rostrum were members of the party and government delegations from various fraternal socialist countries, heads of delegations from various fraternal parties, heads of military delegations from Vietnam and Korea, heads of government delegations from Asian and African countries, and heads of delegations from five major international organizations.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi announced the opening of the celebration meeting. The entire audience stood up, and the orchestra played the national anthem.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi delivered the opening address amidst thunderous applause. In his opening address, he first expressed his most sincere gratitude and warmest welcome to the dear guests who had come from afar to attend our National Day celebrations, to the leading comrades of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, to the representatives of communist parties from various countries, and to friends from all over the world. At this moment, another storm of applause erupted in the venue.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out that the establishment of the People's Republic of China opened up a new socialist era in Chinese history. Over the past ten years, we have rapidly achieved great victories in the socialist revolution, and our socialist construction is developing at a high speed. He emphasized: All our achievements have been created by the hard work of the broad masses of the people. Let us express our highest respect to the working people of the whole country who are holding high the glorious banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction and have achieved great successes in the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement.

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "In the past ten years, we have received fraternal assistance from the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and have received sympathy and support from the proletariat of all countries, all peace-loving countries, and people. We wholeheartedly thank our international friends for their great assistance and support."

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "Our leap forward in construction is only a beginning. We still have very great tasks before us. In order to accomplish such great tasks, we must constantly consolidate and strengthen the great unity of the Chinese people and the great unity of the people of the world."

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi emphatically pointed out: "We will always unite with the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp. We will always unite with the working people of all countries, the democratic and progressive forces of all countries, and the communist parties of all countries. We will always unite with all the people and governments in the world who advocate maintaining peace, striving for national independence, and opposing policies of aggression and war."

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "The United States still occupies our territory of Taiwan, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people must liberate their territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu."

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "The countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union have consistently devoted themselves to easing international tensions and striving for lasting world peace. Thanks to the efforts of peace-loving governments and people all over the world, the demand for peace is increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of all countries. The 650 million people of our country have consistently stood at the forefront of maintaining Asian peace and world peace in the past ten years, and in the future, we will continue to work hand in hand with all peace forces in the world for the cause of peace and for the cause of mutual friendship among the people of all countries."

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi concluded: "Let the people of our country, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, and under the glorious light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, advance bravely and march from victory to greater victory!"

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi's opening remarks were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, on behalf of various democratic parties, non-party democratic figures of the CPPCC, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, presented a congratulatory message to Chairman Mao Zedong. The congratulatory message stated that under your wise leadership and that of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have forever freed themselves from the tragic fate of being enslaved, plundered, and oppressed, and are victoriously carrying out the magnificent cause of socialist construction. Such great achievements are the result of you and the Party Central Committee combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, creatively developing Marxism-Leninism, correctly formulating lines, principles, and policies, and leading the people of the whole country in heroic struggle. The Chinese people have profoundly realized from long-term revolutionary practice: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China."

    The congratulatory message stated that historical facts have proven that the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China has not only played a significant role in the people's democratic revolution, but will also continue to play its role in the era of socialist revolution. We must closely unite around you and the Communist Party of China and follow you and the Party forever.

    Amidst wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience, the heads and representatives of the Soviet Union, socialist countries' party and government delegations, and seventeen fraternal party delegations were invited to speak at the meeting (the full text of the speeches will be published in today's and tomorrow's newspapers).
