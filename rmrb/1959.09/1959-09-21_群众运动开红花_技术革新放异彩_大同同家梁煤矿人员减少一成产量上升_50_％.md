Mass Movement Blossoms, Technical Innovation Shines
Datong Tongjialiang Coal Mine Reduces Personnel by 10% While Output Rises 50%

    (Our dispatch) The experience of Datong's Tongjialiang Coal Mine proves that vigorously launching mass movements, vigorously engaging in technical innovation, and promoting advanced experiences are effective ways to increase coal production. Before the vigorous technical innovation, the mine had 5,500 people and 14 coal mining faces, with an average daily coal output of only about 4,000 tons. After the vigorous technical innovation, 600 workers were reduced, three coal mining faces were reduced, no equipment was added, and the daily coal output rose to 6,000 tons.
    The mass movement of vigorously engaging in technical innovation in Tongjialiang Mine was launched in May. At that time, the socialist competition in the mine was very enthusiastic. Since the 888 coal mining team gave the red flag to the 830 coal mining team, all the members of the team worked hard for more than half a month, coming early and leaving late, but the output was still much worse than that of the 830 team. Jiang Ximing, the captain of the 888 team, discussed with everyone and adopted advanced experiences such as "blasting and loading coal," "overall moving of the chute," and "snake sloughing shift handover." The coal output per shift suddenly increased from 200 tons to 490 tons, surpassing the 830 team. This incident deeply enlightened the leaders of Tongjialiang Mine. The Party committee immediately held a meeting to study and decided to vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously engage in technical innovation, and vigorously promote advanced experiences. Subsequently, the Party secretary, mine manager, and engineers formed a mine-level technical innovation committee, and the branch secretaries, coal mining captains, and technicians formed technical innovation committees for each coal mining face and auxiliary unit, and more than 100 technical innovation groups were also formed. At the same time, more than 120 people were sent to various places to "learn from experience." The Party secretary personally supervised and inspected this work. The entire mine reported daily, summarized every ten days, and compared every half month. If difficulties were found anywhere, manpower and material resources were immediately transferred to support it. If any new machine was successfully trial-produced, technicians were immediately organized to help workers test it until the workers mastered the technology and were happy to use it. This overcame the phenomenon of past technical innovation "only blossoming, not bearing fruit," and truly achieved the goal of proposing many suggestions, realizing them quickly, and being able to use them persistently. Since May, the entire mine has put forward 3,300 innovation proposals, and by the beginning of August, 1,122 had been realized. The twelve advanced experiences in raw coal production summarized by the Ministry of Coal Industry, except for the rock grab machine for vertical shafts (Tongjialiang Mine is an inclined shaft), the remaining eleven have all been promoted. These countless technical innovations and advanced experiences increased efficiency by 50%, doubled or several times. In the past, it took at least eight to ten hours to move a chute, but after implementing the overall movement of the chute, it only took one to two hours. The coal loading machine created by fitter Mao Amao can load more than 50 tons of coal per hour, replacing six to eight chute loaders. Electrician Zhang Jianbang improved the tail shaft of the chute, eliminating chute chain drop accidents, and increasing production by more than 300 tons of coal per day. The transportation area and power equipment area have improved efficiency through technological innovation, freeing up more than 280 people to strengthen the front line of production.

    群众运动开红花  技术革新放异彩
    大同同家梁煤矿人员减少一成产量上升50％
    本报讯　大同同家梁煤矿经验证明，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新和推广先进经验，是提高煤炭产量的有效途径。这个矿在没有大闹技术革新以前，全矿有五千五百人，十四个采煤工作面，煤的平均日产量只有四千吨左右。大闹技术革新以后，减少了六百名工人，减少了三个采煤工作面，没有增添任何设备，煤的日产量上升到六千吨。
    同家梁矿大闹技术革新的群众运动是5月份掀起的。当时，矿里开展的社会主义竞赛十分热烈。八百八十八采煤队自从把红旗送给八百三十采煤队以后，全队的人早来晚归努力干了半个多月，产量还是比八百三十队差得多。八百八十八队队长姜席明便和大家研究，采用了“爆破装煤”、“整体移溜子”、“蛇脱皮交接班”等先进经验。每小班产煤量一下子由二百吨提高到四百九十吨，超过了八百三十队。这件事深深地启发了同家梁矿的领导人员。党委立即开会研究，决定大张旗鼓地大搞群众运动大闹技术革新并大力推广先进经验。随后，党委书记、矿长、工程师组成了矿级技术革新委员会，由支部书记、采煤队长和技术员组成了各个采煤工作面和辅助单位的技术革新委员会，还组成了一百多个技术革新小组。同时派出一百二十多人到各地去“取经”。党委书记亲自督促检查这一工作。全矿每天一汇报，十天一总结，半月一评比。发现哪里有困难，马上抽调人力、物力支援，有什么新机器试制成功了，马上组织技术人员去帮助工人试用，直到工人掌握了技术，乐于使用为止。这便克服了过去技术革新“只开花，不结果”的现象，真正做到了建议提得多，实现得快，而且能持久运用。5月份以来，全矿共提出三千三百件革新建议，到8月上旬，已实现了一千一百二十二件。煤炭工业部总结的原煤生产十二项先进经验，除立井用抓岩机一项外（同家梁矿是斜井），其余十一项已全部推广。这些数不尽的技术革新和先进经验，提高效率50％、一倍到几倍。过去移一次溜子至少要八小时到十小时，实行整体移溜子以后，只要一小时到两小时就够了。钳工毛阿毛创造的装煤机，每小时能装煤五十多吨，代替了六个到八个装溜子工。电工张建邦改进了溜子尾轴，消灭了溜子掉链子事故，每天能多生产三百多吨煤，运输区和动力设备区由于革新技术提高了效率，腾出二百八十多人充实了生产第一线。
