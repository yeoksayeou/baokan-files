Cannot Withstand a Puff
Ba Ren

After reading the shameless slander of our Great Leap Forward by the United States Information Service, I initially felt very angry. However, after careful consideration, I couldn't help but smile wryly. The imperialists, even if reduced to ashes, are still imperialists. "Ivory doesn't grow from a dog's mouth"—it cannot withstand a puff.

However, I would like to delve into the character of this last demon in human history, the American imperialist. In my understanding, its character is a grand synthesis of "bandit," "hooligan," and "thief." It is single-mindedly obsessed with dominating the world, organizing military blocs, establishing military bases, creating tense situations, and preparing for world war—undoubtedly bandit behavior. But in the current world situation, the forces of peace outweigh the forces of war, and the socialist camp is far stronger and more consolidated than the imperialist camp. After the failure of America's atomic blackmail policy, it is now doing its utmost to divide the neutralist nation-states, using both open seduction and covert attacks, "giving money" at the front door while profiting behind it, thereby dividing the world's peace forces. This is playing the hooligan. However, the socialist camp and the world's peace forces are simply too strong, too difficult to shake. If banditry and hooliganism alone cannot achieve their goals, then they unleash their thieving tricks, attempting to climb over walls and burrow through holes to steal the souls of the people of socialist countries. They spare no effort in spreading rumors and slander.

The Americans' tireless efforts to distort and vilify the communiqué and resolutions of our Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee is precisely a large-scale display of this "soul-stealing" tactic. Their purpose is nothing more than to take advantage of our verification of some production figures from last year and the adjustment of this year's production targets, to confuse right and wrong, creating the impression that we have really messed things up, in order to stir up chaotic thoughts and undermine morale within our country. Abroad, especially among the people of Asian and African countries, they aim to undermine the prestige of New China and erode their enthusiasm for actively striving for national liberation, making them harbor illusions of relying on American imperialists. Their meaning is nothing more than to say: Look how terrible China is! Orientals have no way to find a way out and escape poverty; they should obediently rely on my whims to live! The American gentlemen's intentions are undeniably malicious, and their methods undeniably despicable, but in the end, they are ineffective. Within our country, the whole nation is united, and people are celebrating the publication of the communiqué and resolutions with gongs and drums. People are answering the Party's call and refuting the slanders of enemies at home and abroad with good news from every production front. Abroad, people are also unanimously praising the great achievements of the Chinese people in 1958, and wishing the Chinese people new victories in 1959. The people are more united, and their confidence is greater. Even some relatively realistic-minded bourgeois scholars in the Western world, although they are uncomfortable with New China, cannot help but "bark at Yao" and echo the slander after the publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC. However, in the face of ironclad figures, they cannot but admit that our country's production last year was a Great Leap Forward, and this year's plan is still an amazing leap forward. Only a small handful of people who extremely hate New China have completely become the echo of the United States. In fact, they are originally slaves of the American imperialists, so what is so strange?

Writing this, two lines of poetry suddenly popped into my head:

"Li and Du's writings remain, shining with boundless brilliance; They do not know that the children are foolish, so why use slanderous injury? An ant trying to shake a big tree is ridiculously overestimating itself."

This is very suitable for annotating the capitalist countries' slander of our Great Leap Forward. If some slanderers are just a group of ignorant children, then the American imperialists are precisely a group of ants that overestimate themselves. The ant is a winged ant that comes out in the evening to buzz around a big tree; but it will run away or drop its wings when it sees light or is blown by the wind. It is said that those who lose their wings will die. In short, its lifespan is not long. This is probably also the fate of the American imperialists—unable to withstand a puff!

    经不起一嘘
    巴人
    读了美国新闻处对我国大跃进的无耻诽谤，最初感到很愤怒，之后，仔细一想，又不禁哑然失笑。美帝国主义者就是化骨成灰也还是美帝国主义者，“狗嘴里长不出象牙”，那是经不起一嘘的。
    可是，我倒想从中发掘一下美帝国主义者这个人类历史中最后一个魔王的性格。照我的理解，它的性格是集“强盗”、“流氓”和“小偷”的大成。它一心想独霸世界，组织军事集团，建立军事基地，制造紧张局势，准备世界大战，无疑是强盗行径。但当前的世界形势，和平力量超过战争力量，社会主义阵营远比帝国主义阵营更为强大与巩固，美国原子讹诈政策失败之后，目前就竭力分化遵守中立政策的民族国家，明拉暗打，前门“送钱”，后门捞本，进而分化世界和平力量，这耍的就是流氓手段。可是，社会主义阵营和世界和平力量实在太强大了，太难于动摇了。只是强盗行径和流氓手段也还不能达到目的，那就放出他的小偷伎俩来，企图逾墙穿穴，窃取社会主义国家人民的灵魂。造谣诽谤，无所不用其极。
    美国人如此不惜力气的对我党的八届八中全会公报和决议进行歪曲和诬蔑，正是这种“偷心”战术的大施展。其目的不外乎是借着我们核实去年一些生产数字，调整今年生产指标的机会，来混淆是非，造成我们仿佛真的搞糟了的印象，以便在我们国内煽起混乱思想，瓦解斗志，在国外，特别是在亚非国家人民中，破坏新中国的声望，瓦解他们积极争取民族解放的热情，使他们产生投靠美帝国主义者的幻想。他们的意思无非是说：请看看中国多么糟呀，东方人是没有办法找到出路和摆脱贫穷的，还是老老实实的仰仗我的鼻息生活吧！美国老爷们的用心不算不恶毒，手段不算不卑鄙，但终归还是无效的。在我们国内，举国一致，人们敲锣打鼓地欢庆公报和决议的公布；人们用各个生产战线上的捷报来回答党的号召和国内外敌人的诬蔑。在国外，人们也齐声赞扬中国人民在1958年的巨大成就，预祝中国人民1959年新的胜利。人民团结得更紧，信心更大了，就连西方世界的一些比较具有现实头脑的资产阶级学者，尽管他们对新中国满心不舒服，在中共八届八中全会文件发表后，虽也不免“桀犬吠尧”，随声诬蔑，但在铁的数字之前，也不能不承认去年我国生产是大跃进，今年计划依然是可惊的跃进。只有一小撮极端仇恨新中国的人，才完全作了美国的应声虫。其实他们本也就是美帝国主义者的奴才，这又有什么奇怪？
    写到这里，脑中却忽然跳出了两句诗来：
    “李杜文章在，光焰万丈长；不知群儿愚，那用故谤伤。蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。”
    这用来注解资本主义国家对我们大跃进的诬蔑却是很适当的，如果说，有些诬蔑者还不过是一群无知的小儿，那么，美帝国主义者却正是一群自不量力的蚍蜉。考蚍蜉是生翼的蚂蚁，在晚间才出来围在大树上嘤嘤嗡嗡；可是它一见光或被风吹就要逃走，或掉下翼子来的。掉了翼的据说就要死掉了。总之，它的寿命是不长的。这怕就也是美帝国主义者经不起一嘘的命运吧！
