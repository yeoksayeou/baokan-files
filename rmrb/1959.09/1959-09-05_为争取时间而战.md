Fighting for Time
By our reporters Wang Yi and Xiao Guang

Bulgarians like to compare the face of their motherland to a radiant carpet, and there is good reason for this. We had the same impression when we first flew over Bulgaria.

The green fields are boundless, and the sparkling rivers flow through them. Vegetables and fruits of bright colors, row after row, ridge after ridge, are planted so neatly and smoothly, as if embroidered on the ground. The Balkan Mountains, which are capped with snow all year round, stretch east and west, forming a winding corridor. Red-roofed and white-walled houses of all sizes, and densely forested trees, gather and scatter on the green hills and plains north and south of the Balkan foothills. This beautiful and picturesque scenery, at a glance, is it not like a carpet with a fresh style? Only when you set foot on Bulgarian soil, especially after living here for some time, will you discover: what an unusual carpet this is! It not only has the light of the East and the fragrance of the South, but also is filled with patriotic enthusiasm everywhere.

	The Bugle of the Great Leap Forward

We arrived in Bulgaria just in time for the upsurge of the Bulgarian people's movement to strive to complete the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) in three or four years. "Achieve a great leap forward in the country's development, develop productive forces at a new and faster speed, and complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in terms of total output value and national income in three or four years" - this inspiring call was made by the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee plenary session in October and November last year to the whole party and the whole people. It is also an important part of the Bulgarian Communist Party's grand program for expanding reproduction during 1959-1962-1965 in order to accelerate the development of the national economy and improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

Comrade Mitko Grigoriev, Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, emphasized in an interview with reporters that, since the socialist system has achieved victories in all aspects of Bulgaria, and since the transitional stage from capitalism to socialism has ended, Bulgaria's politics and economy are now at a new stage of development. In order to complete socialist construction ahead of schedule and rapidly improve the people's living standards, Bulgaria must greatly develop production and extensively establish the material basis of socialism. The question is at what speed to develop.

This point was resolved in the report outline on developing Bulgaria into a prosperous socialist country by Comrade Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, which was adopted by the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee plenary session in January this year. The outline stipulates that the total industrial output value in 1962 will more than double that in 1957, and the total industrial output value in 1965 will increase by about two to three times that in 1957. The total agricultural output value in 1962 will reach 40 to 45 billion leva; the total agricultural output value in 1965 will reach 60 billion leva, that is, more than three times the growth compared to 1957. This shows that in 1962, the national income will reach 80 to 85 billion leva; in 1965, the national income will reach about 100 to 110 billion leva, about 70 to 75 billion leva more than in 1957. That is to say, by 1962, the consumption of the Bulgarian people will increase by almost double that of 1957, and in 1965 it will increase by more than double!

The speed and scale of development are unprecedented in Bulgarian history. What is being discussed here is not a matter of increasing production by a few percent, but a matter of increasing it by several times. The task is undoubtedly arduous. But the hardworking and brave Bulgarian working people responded to the call of the Party with full enthusiasm and soaring energy.

	Winter Following Summer

On the way from Sofia to Varna on the Black Sea coast, we saw newly opened terraces everywhere, encircling the hills like flower crowns; irrigation canals and small reservoirs, like strings of strung pearls, shimmering under the blue sky. A Bulgarian friend accompanying us told us that these are all the achievements of the agricultural cooperative members' leap forward. Those hills were bare not long ago, but now they are all planted with fruit trees, grapes or raspberries. Most of the irrigation canals and reservoirs were also newly dug. Hundreds of thousands of rural workers in Bulgaria, in order to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, worked millions of working days in the three months from last winter to this spring alone. They built 1,400 small reservoirs and storage ponds, more than 550 pumping stations and drilled wells, and more than 4,600 kilometers of irrigation canals. They also accumulated and transported millions of tons of fertilizer, built thousands of large modern fertilizer and urine storage pools, and cleared pastures and fields...

Working in winter has never been heard of, not only in Bulgaria, but also in the whole of Europe. Isn't there a humorous little tune popular in Bulgarian folk songs that goes like this:

    "Old man Stoyan, who are you angry at?
    Whoever is lazy in summer will starve in winter."

Originally, according to the habits of the Bulgarian countryside, winter was not for working at all. However, the agricultural cooperative members, inspired by the grand construction program, can't care about that much today.

	Labor Combined with Science

Along the roads, there are many slogan signs and posters publicizing the early completion of the Five-Year Plan. The vividness of the pictures often makes people laugh: big fat pigs nodding and smiling, hens selling eggs, they vividly remind you of the production increase targets that livestock and poultry must complete from now until 1962-1965. What these numbers and pictures show is more than just a general call for increased production, they themselves are good signs of a leap forward.

Developing pig and poultry farming is of paramount importance in the overall plan to increase the quantity of livestock products. The plan requires that this year's pork production be one and a half times more than last year's, and chicken and eggs more than double that of last year. To complete such an arduous task, there are naturally many difficulties, especially in terms of ideology. Leaders in individual places always believe that their region does not have the conditions for developing chicken farming. But after the Party helped them clear all kinds of ideological obstacles, the situation greatly changed.

Nowadays, modern chicken farms have been generally established throughout the country. Each chicken farm can raise about 5,000 chickens. The Party has entrusted the work of feeding chicks, which requires great patience and labor enthusiasm, to rural girls who have received secondary education. The Party has also sent energetic and educated young men to livestock farms, so that their labor has a modern scientific basis. These young people stubbornly read livestock science books, and never forget to ask experienced old breeders for advice, and the effect is quickly produced. Nowadays, many chicken-raising girls have reduced the mortality rate of chickens to a minimum. And those young breeders and milkers who spend all day drilling under the bellies of cows not only significantly increase the number of dairy cows and the amount of milk, but also derive a set of correct experiences in feeding dairy cows. In their own words: "The breed of the cow changes from the mouth."

Agricultural workers are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. Agricultural cooperative members and rural Communist Youth League members in Pleven Oblast recently proposed that each person should feed at least five chickens and ducks, and each household should raise at least one piglet and one ewe, and hand them over to the agricultural cooperative for national use. This proposal has been warmly responded to by agricultural cooperatives in other oblasts of Bulgaria.

	"Small Cooperatives Merge into Large Ones"

We felt very親切 about our visit to "Sungurlare". This agricultural production cooperative, which is famous throughout the country for producing wine, was only merged from twenty-three small cooperatives last winter, and in just half a year it has shown the various benefits of large cooperatives.

The leap forward slogan proposed by the "Sungurlare" agricultural cooperative is: double production this year, double production next year, and continuously increase the income of cooperative members on the basis of increased production. Before the merger last year, the cash distributed to cooperative members throughout the cooperative was 39 million leva. This year's plan is 62 million leva; next year it will be even higher: 80 million leva. According to the draft seven-year development plan of "Sungurlare", it is estimated that by 1965, the vineyards will be expanded from the current 2,800 hectares to more than 3,300 hectares, and the orchards will be expanded from the current 420 hectares to 1,700 hectares; the total output value will increase sixfold compared to now.

Although the targets for increasing production are high, the cooperative members are full of confidence in practicing them. Socialist labor hero Comrade Heskova accompanied us to lunch. This female cooperative member, who won the Gold Star Medal for greatly increasing grape production, is determined to strive for a second Gold Star Medal in the new leap forward. Comrade Ivan Marinov, Secretary of the Cooperative Party Committee, believes that the greatest potential for increasing production in "Sungurlare" is to concentrate the previously scattered manpower and material resources. "Small cooperatives merge into large ones" provides full possibilities for developing diversified economies, so that every hectare of land can be used rationally. The unified allocation of manpower, livestock, and machinery also guarantees large-scale irrigation, top dressing, and mechanization. Like this year, the task of water conservancy construction is arduous. Without such strong strength after the merger and overall planning, it would be difficult to imagine completing the task.

In order to help agricultural cooperatives achieve a leap forward, and also to study new theoretical issues in the stage of socialist construction, the Party has sent out its excellent experts. We met Comrade Dimitri Volkov, Professor of Agronomy at Sofia University, in "Sungurlare". This enthusiastic expert on socialist rural structure has now become the most popular consultant in Sungurlare, and is busy every day meeting with local leading cadres to formulate the agricultural cooperative's long-term plan. He has already settled down in the village, and "declared" that he will not return to Sofia until the day the "Sungurlare" seven-year plan is realized!

	The Whole People Care About the Leap Forward

The enthusiasm on the industrial and other fronts is by no means less than that of agriculture. Thousands of employee groups strive to improve labor organization and create new working methods through their own creative exploration. People think of new ways almost every day to improve labor productivity, increase production, reduce costs and save raw materials. For example, textile workers make full use of the functions of machines - increasing the operating rate. The "Kolarov" cotton textile joint factory in Gabrovo alone will produce 5.4 million meters more cotton cloth this year simply by increasing the operating rate of textile machines. Another example is that the miners of "Borieva" and "Konsky Dol" have changed to the new mining methods of segmented caving and staged caving, which has doubled productivity; the largest "Republic" furniture factory in the country has simplified processes and created a one-time assembly method for certain furniture; employees of refractory material factories have adopted a semi-dry molding method, which not only greatly accelerates production, but also improves product quality. ...

In short, new tricks are emerging one after another, and records are being refreshed at any time. It is very likely that by the time this newsletter is published, the examples introduced above are no longer news.

Bulgaria's office cadres, students and ordinary residents also organize voluntary labor from time to time to help complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In daily life, it is not difficult to see people's concern and enthusiasm for the industrial and agricultural production movement. We saw such a thing in one of the largest hospitals in Sofia: a miner came to the outpatient department to see a doctor, and all the patients who had been waiting for a long time scrambled to let him see the doctor first. They didn't know each other, just because he was a miner, a fighter of the Five-Year Plan.

	The Tree of Life is Evergreen

Through our personal feelings and experiences in Bulgaria, we sincerely feel that the Bulgarian Communist Party's slogan of striving to complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years is not only a lofty patriotic aspiration, but also a brilliant understanding and trust of the essence of the socialist system and the creative power of the people. Isn't the fact the best proof? 1959 is the decisive year for striving to complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years, and by the end of June this year, industry had overfulfilled the first half of the year's plan by 101.4%, an increase of 23.4% compared to the same period in 1958. In terms of agriculture, this year's wheat harvest is abundant, and corn and other autumn crops are also growing well. As long as there are no serious natural disasters, a bumper harvest is not a problem.

Comrade Grigoriev, Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, reminded us that things were not smooth sailing from the beginning. The Party went through heavy struggles against erroneous ideas, especially conservative ideas. Today, practice has proved that the tasks stipulated in Comrade Zhivkov's report outline are correct, but initially not everyone shook their heads at it.

For example, the outline stipulates that in 1965, the irrigated area should reach 20 million decares; in this way, 40% of the country's arable land will be permanently free from periodic droughts, ensuring bumper harvests of crops. At that time, many water conservancy experts expressed doubts about the reality of this task. They said: even if all the river water and rainwater in Bulgaria were added together, it would not be enough to irrigate 20 million decares of arable land. The Party believes that the best prescription for treating the ideas of these people is life; because "theory is gray, but the tree of life is evergreen". So the Party sent these water conservancy experts to agricultural production cooperatives and let them see for themselves how the farmers would treat the task of water conservancy construction. Still these same experts, after only a few months, returned to Sofia and proposed to the Central Committee: with the same funds, not only can 20 million decares be completed, but 25 million decares of arable land can be irrigated!

	Conquering Time

When the entire movement achieved certain successes, the Party paid special attention to reminding and educating the people: they cannot stop halfway, rest, and look around at their achievements and stop moving forward. And for those phenomena of complacency, slackness, bureaucracy, and alienation from the masses due to achievements, measures need to be taken without politeness.

Obviously, that is only an individual case. Here, the vast majority of people understand that they are racing against time. Perhaps you have heard the story of Communist Youth League member Lazarov. This young cement worker risked being burned to ashes by accident, drilled through the mouth of a five-hundred-degree high-temperature furnace, and removed the fault for the kiln. No one ordered him to do so. He only thought that if he waited for the kiln to shut down and cool for sixteen hours before repairing it, the factory would lose one hundred and eighty tons of cement. In fact, in Bulgaria, there are more than thousands of people like Lazarov. For them, time is wealth. Conquering time not only means an unprecedented increase in living standards, but also means winning the race against capitalism and proving the vitality of the socialist system.

The Bulgarian Communist Party attaches great importance to educating the people in "every second counts". Comrade Zhivkov said: "It is a 'mistake' to think that today's Young Pioneers are the people who will build a communist society in our country tomorrow." We have also seen Bulgarian friends patting their children on the shoulders and proudly admitting this "mistake"; and declaring that they are the builders of Bulgaria's communist society. Their revolutionary passion to turn socialist ideals into reality deeply inspires people. We were guests in Bulgaria, and this aspect impressed us especially deeply. Although we have been away from Bulgaria for nearly a month, we still cannot help but feel excited when we recall it. Here, we would like to use a corner of the newspaper to wish the fraternal Bulgarian people to fly their skillful hands faster and weave a beautiful picture of communism on this unusual "carpet" of Bulgaria as soon as possible!

    为争取时间而战
    本报记者　王揖　萧光
    保加利亚人喜欢把自己祖国的面貌比喻为一张光彩绚烂的地毯，这不是没有道理的。我们第一次在保加利亚的上空飞行，就有同样的印象。
    绿色的原野无边无际，闪闪发光的河水奔流其间。颜色鲜艳的蔬菜、花果，一畦畦，一垅垅，栽的那么整齐、熨贴，就跟绣在地面上似的。终年戴着雪帽的巴尔干群山，东西伸展，形成一道曲折的走廊。红顶白墙的大小房屋，浓密成林的树木，聚散在巴尔干山麓南北绿色的丘陵平原上。这绮丽如画的景色，一眼望去，不正像一张格调清新的地毯吗？只是当你踏上保加利亚的土地，特别是在这里生活一些时候以后，你就会发现：这是一张多么不寻常的地毯呵！它不仅有着东方的光明、南方的芳香，而且处处洋溢着爱国主义的热情。
        跃进的号角
    我们初到保加利亚，正赶上保加利亚人民争取三、四年内完成第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）运动高涨的时候。“在国家的发展中实现跃进，以新的更快的速度发展生产力，在总产值和国民收入方面三、四年内提前完成五年计划”——这项振奋人心的号召，是去年10月、11月保共中央全会向全党和全民提出的。它也是保加利亚共产党为了加速发展国民经济、提高劳动人民的物质文化水平，决定在1959—1962—1965年期间扩大再生产的宏伟纲领的一个重要部分。
    保共中央书记米特哥·格里戈罗夫同志在接见记者的时候，曾经强调说：由于社会主义制度已在保加利亚各方面取得了胜利，由于从资本主义到社会主义的过渡阶段已经结束，目前保加利亚的政治和经济，正处在一个新的发展阶段。为了提前完成社会主义建设，迅速提高人民的生活水平，保加利亚必须大大发展生产，广泛建立社会主义的物质基础。问题就在用怎样的速度来发展。
    这一点，在今年1月保共中央全会通过的保共中央第一书记日夫科夫同志关于保加利亚发展为繁荣的社会主义国家的报告提纲中，得到了解决。提纲规定1962年的工业总产值将比1957年增加一倍多，1965年的工业总产值将比1957年增加约两、三倍。1962年农业总产值将达到四百到四百五十亿列弗；1965年农业总产值将达到六百亿列弗，即比1957年增长三倍多。这表明，1962年国民收入将达到八百到八百五十亿列弗；1965年国民收入将达到约一千到一千一百亿列弗，比1957年约多七百到七百五十亿列弗。也就是说，到1962年，保加利亚人民的消费量将比1957年增加几乎一倍，而1965年将增加两倍以上！
    发展的速度和规模，在保加利亚历史上是空前的。这里所提的已经不是生产增加百分之几，而是增加几倍的问题。任务无疑是艰巨的。但勤劳勇敢的保加利亚劳动人民，却以满腔的热情和冲天的干劲回答党的召唤。
        冬以继夏
    从索非亚到黑海之滨瓦尔那的一路上，我们到处看见新开辟的层层梯田，花冠似的环绕在山丘上；灌溉渠和小水库像穿线珍珠般的一串一串，在蓝色的天空下泛着波光。同行的保加利亚朋友告诉我们：这都是农业社员们跃进的成绩。那些山丘前不久还是光秃秃的，现在却全栽上果树、葡萄或复盆子了。灌溉渠和蓄水池也多是新挖成的。保加利亚几十万农村的劳动者，为了争取提前完成五年计划，光在去冬今春的三个月里，就作了几百万个劳动日。他们修建了一千四百个小水库和蓄水池，五百五十多个抽水站和凿管井，四千六百多公里的灌溉渠。他们还积贮和运送了几百万吨肥料，建造几千个大型现代化积肥和贮尿池，清除草场和田地……
    冬季出工，这不单在保加利亚，就在全欧洲也没有听说过。保加利亚民间流行的一首诙谐小调不是这样唱的吗：
    “斯托扬老爷，你生谁的气？
    谁在夏天偷懒，冬天就要饿肚皮。”
    原来按照保加利亚农村的习惯，冬天是根本不干活的。然而，为宏伟的建设纲领所鼓舞的农业社员们，今天却顾不得那么多了。
        劳动结合科学
    公路两旁，竖有许多宣传提前完成五年计划的标语牌、招贴画。画面之生动，往往引人失笑：点头微笑的大肥猪，叫卖鸡蛋的老母鸡，它们神气活现地提醒你，从现在起到1962—1965年，牲畜和家禽必须完成的增产指标。这些数字和画面所显示的岂止是一般的增产号召，它们本身就是很好的跃进标志。
    发展养猪和家禽在整个争取增加畜牧产品数量的计划中，有着头等重要的意义。计划要求今年猪肉的产量比去年增加一倍半，鸡和蛋类比去年增加两倍多。要完成这样艰巨的任务，困难自然很多，特别是思想方面的。个别地方的领导人总认为他们那个地区没有发展养鸡的条件。但是当党帮助他们清除了形形色色的思想障碍之后，情况就大大改观了。
    如今全国各地已普遍建立起现代化的养鸡场，每个养鸡场可以养鸡五千只左右。党把喂养小鸡这件需要很大耐心和劳动热情的工作，委托给了受过中等教育的农村姑娘。党还把精力充沛和有文化的小伙子派到畜牧场去，使他们的劳动有现代科学为基础。这些年轻人顽强地阅读畜牧科学书籍，也从不忘记向经验丰富的老饲养员们请教，效果很快就产生了。现今许多养鸡姑娘已把鸡的死亡率降到最低限度。而那些成天在牛肚子下面钻来钻去的青年饲养员、挤奶员，不仅使奶牛头数和挤奶量显著增加，而且得出了一套正确喂养奶牛的经验，用他们自己的话说：“牛的品种从嘴里变。”
    农业劳动者并不满足已经取得的成就。普列文州的农业社员和农村共青团员不久以前还提出倡议：每人至少喂五只鸡鸭，每户至少养一头小猪和一只母羊，交农业社供国家使用，这项倡议获得了保加利亚其他各州农业社的热烈响应。
        “小社并大”
    对“松古拉尔”的访问，我们感到非常亲切。这个以产葡萄酒闻名全国的农业生产合作社，去年冬天才由二十三个小社合并起来，短短半年已显示出大社的种种好处。
    “松古拉尔”农业社提的跃进口号是：今年增产一倍，明年增产两倍，并在生产增加的基础上，不断增加社员的收入。去年合并前，全社分配给社员的现金是三千九百万列弗。今年计划是六千二百万列弗；明年则更高：八千万列弗。根据“松古拉尔”的七年发展计划草案，预计到1965年，葡萄园将由目前的二千八百公顷扩大到三千三百多公顷，果园由现在的四百二十公顷扩大到一千七百公顷；总产值将比现在增加六倍。
    增产的指标虽高，社员们都满怀实践的信心。社会主义劳动英雄歇斯柯娃同志陪我们共进午餐。这位曾因大大提高葡萄产量而获得金星奖章的女社员，决心在新的跃进中争取第二枚金星奖章。社党委书记伊凡·马里诺夫同志认为，“松古拉尔”增产最大的潜力就是把过去分散的人力和物力集中起来了。“小社并大”为发展多种经济提供了充分的可能性，使每公顷土地都能合理使用。人力、畜力、机器的统一调配，也使大规模的灌溉、追肥、机械化等有了保障。像今年，兴修水利的任务繁重，如果没有并社以后这样雄厚的实力，并且进行全面规划，完成任务是难以想像的。
    为了帮助农业社实现跃进，也为了研究社会主义建设阶段新的理论问题，党派出了自己优秀的专家。我们在“松古拉尔”就曾遇见索非亚大学的农学教授季米德里·沃尔科夫同志。这位热情奔放的社会主义农村结构专家，现在已成了松古拉尔最受欢迎的顾问，每天都忙着会同当地领导干部制定农业社的远景规划。他已经在村里落了户，并且“声明”：不到“松古拉尔”实现七年计划那一天不回索非亚！
        全民关心跃进
    工业和其他各条战线上的干劲，也决不次于农业。成千上万的职工团体，力求通过自己创造性的摸索，改进劳动组织，创造新的工作方法。人们几乎每天都想出新的办法来提高劳动生产率、增加产量、降低成本和节约原料。例如，纺织工人充分利用了机器的功能——增加运转率。加布罗沃市的“科拉罗夫”棉纺联合厂仅仅通过提高纺织机的运转率，今年就将多生产五百四十万米棉布。又如，“保里耶娃”和“康斯基多尔”的矿工们，改用分段崩落和阶段崩落的新采矿法，把生产率提高了一倍；全国最大的“共和国”木器厂简化工序，创造了某些家具的一次装配法；耐火材料工厂职工采取半干燥压模法，既大大加速生产，又提高了产品质量。……
    总之，新的窍门层出不穷，纪录随时都在刷新。很可能当这篇通讯见报时，前面所介绍的例子早已不是什么新闻了。
    保加利亚的机关干部、学生和普通居民，也不时组织义务劳动来帮助五年计划的提前完成。在日常生活中间，不难看出人们对于工农业生产运动的关心和热情。我们在索非亚一家最大的医院里，就曾见到这样的事：一个矿工来到门诊部看病，所有候诊已久的病人都争着让他先看。他们互相谁也不认识，只因为他是一位矿工，一个五年计划的战士。
        生活之树常青
    通过在保加利亚的亲身感受和见闻，我们切实地感到：保加利亚共产党争取三、四年内完成第三个五年计划的口号，不仅是一种崇高的爱国主义的愿望，而且是对社会主义制度实质和人民创造力量的英明了解和信任。难道事实不是最好的证明吗？1959年是争取三、四年完成第三个五年计划决定性的一年，而到今年6月底，工业已超额完成上半年计划的101.4％，比1958年同期增长23.4％。农业方面今年小麦丰收，玉蜀黍和其他秋季作物也生长良好，只要没有严重的自然灾害，丰收是不成问题的。
    保共中央书记格里戈罗夫同志提醒我们，事情并不是从开始就一帆风顺的。党经过了同错误思想的重重斗争，特别是保守思想。今天，实践已经证明日夫科夫同志的报告提纲中所规定的任务是正确的，但最初并非没有人对它摇过头。
    譬如提纲规定1965年，灌溉面积要达到二千万狄卡尔；这样全国就能有40％的耕地永远摆脱周期性的干旱，保证农作物的丰收。当时许多水利专家都对这项任务的现实性表示怀疑。他们说：就是把全保加利亚的河水和雨水统统加在一起，也不足以灌溉二千万狄卡尔的耕地。党认为医治这些人的思想，最好的处方就是生活；因为“理论是灰色的，生活之树则是常青的”。于是党就把这些水利专家派到农业生产合作社去，让他们自己去看看农民将怎样对待兴修水利的任务。仍然是这批专家，仅仅几个月，回到索非亚都向中央提出：同样的资金，不仅可以完成二千万狄卡尔，而且可以完成灌溉二千五百万狄卡尔的耕地！
        战胜时间
    当整个运动取得了一定成就的时候，党就特别注意提醒和教育人民：不能半途停顿、歇脚，环顾自己的成就而止步不前。而对那些因成绩而自满、松懈以及官僚主义、脱离群众的现象，就需要不客气地采取措施了。
    显然，那只是个别的情况。这里，绝大多数人民都懂得他们是在同时间赛跑。也许你已经听说共青团员拉扎罗夫的故事。这个年轻的水泥工人曾经冒着一不小心就被烧成灰烬的危险，钻越五百度高温的炉口，为窑炉排除故障。没有任何人命令他这样做，他只想到如果等窑炉停火十六小时冷却以后再修补，工厂就将损失一百八十吨水泥。其实在保加利亚，像拉扎罗夫这样的人何止万千。对于他们来说，时间就是财富。战胜时间，这不仅意味着生活水平的空前提高，而且意味着赢得对资本主义的竞赛，证实社会主义制度的生命力。
    保加利亚共产党十分重视对人民进行“分秒必争”的教育。日夫科夫同志说过：“认为今天的少先队员是明天在我国建设共产主义社会的人，是个‘错误’”。我们也曾见过保加利亚朋友拍着孩子们的肩膀，自豪地承认这种“错误”；并且宣布自己就是保加利亚共产主义社会的建设者。他们那种变社会主义理想为现实的革命激情，使人深深地受到感染。我们在保加利亚作客，这方面的印象特别深刻。虽然离开保加利亚已经将近一月，每当回忆起来，还不能不感觉激动。这里，我们愿意借报纸的一角，祝兄弟的保加利亚人民更快地飞舞他们精巧的双手，在保加利亚这张不寻常的“地毯”上，早日织出共产主义的美丽图画！
