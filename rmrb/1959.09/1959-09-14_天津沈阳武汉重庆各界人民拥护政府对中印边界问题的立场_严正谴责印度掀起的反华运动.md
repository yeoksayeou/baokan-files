Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 13th: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPPCC held an enlarged meeting today to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue. Responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and well-known figures from all walks of life, in their speeches, fully supported the solemn position taken by our government on the Sino-Indian border issue and angrily condemned the Indian army's acts of aggression against our territory.

Yang Yizhou, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), said that Nehru's letter to Premier Zhou was full of absurd arguments. First, he emphasized that "the traditional boundary follows the geographical principle of the watershed of the Himalayan mountain range." This statement is completely one-sided. The Chinese people have never recognized this line, so how can it be called a "traditional boundary"? Second, Nehru emphasized that the so-called McMahon Line was "decided at the Simla Conference," but everyone knows that the Simla Conference was an important step in British imperialism's invasion of China's Tibet region. The so-called McMahon Line was not discussed at the conference, and all decisions and secret treaties of the Simla Conference were not signed by representatives of the Chinese central government, so how can they become binding international treaties? Zhang Guofan, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), said that the anti-China movement launched by the Indian reactionaries only benefits imperialism and is of no benefit to the Indian people or to the peace of the Southeast Asian region. We solemnly warn the Indian reactionaries that you are absolutely not allowed to undermine the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples. Zhu Jisheng, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), said that Mr. Nehru's insistence on imposing the illegal McMahon Line on the Chinese people is wishful thinking. The Chinese people will never allow others to divide our territory. Yang Shixian, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) and President of Nankai University, said: The Indian authorities are inheriting the disgraceful legacy of British imperialism and vainly attempting to occupy our territory. Indian expansionists are distorting the facts and fabricating facts to launch an anti-China movement, which will not bring any benefits to the Indian people. On the contrary, it will only allow imperialism to reap the benefits.

Wang Weiqi, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said that Indian expansionists created the Sino-Indian border incident in an attempt to occupy our territory, and have repeatedly gathered thugs to demonstrate in front of the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in India, slandering our country and national leaders, which is intolerable. The broad masses of workers in Hebei Province express their solemn protest against this. We demand that the Indian government immediately withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who have crossed into Chinese territory, so that the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border can be eased as soon as possible.

Experts, engineers, doctors, non-party democratic人士, and religious figures who attended the meeting also unanimously condemned the various clamors made by the Indian reactionaries on the Sino-Indian border issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 12th: People from all walks of life in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City fully support the solemn position taken by Premier Zhou Enlai in his reply to Prime Minister Nehru regarding the settlement of the Sino-Indian border issue, and express great indignation at the new anti-China wave launched by some people with ulterior motives in India.

The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) convened responsible persons from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and figures from all walks of life in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City on September 11 to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue. Speakers at the meeting condemned the anti-China wave launched by some people with ulterior motives in India. Gong Tianmin, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), said: "Some politicians and propaganda organs with ulterior motives in India are spreading a large number of anti-China remarks, clamoring that China is invading India, which is completely turning black into white. India unilaterally modified the Sino-Indian border, and Indian troops even invaded north of the McMahon Line. Who is invading whom? Indian expansionists clamor that China has invaded India, isn't this a case of the thief crying 'stop thief'?" Dao Chen, President of the Liaoning Provincial Buddhist Association and Abbot of Ci'en Temple, said: "India's trespassing and provocative behavior violates Buddhist teachings. We hope that India should resolve the Sino-Indian border issue with an attitude of mutual sympathy, understanding, fairness and reasonableness."

Speakers at the meeting expressed great regret that Prime Minister Nehru, one of the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, repeatedly distorted the facts and made remarks about China's so-called "aggression" in the Indian Parliament. Chen Xianzhou, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), pointed out that Nehru even wants China to accept territorial demands that would humiliate the country and forfeit its sovereignty. This will not only never achieve its goal, but will only lose the Chinese people's respect for him.

The broad masses of people in Shenyang also commented on the Sino-Indian border issue. Wang Feng'en, a Shenyang model worker and engineer of worker origin, Li Chunrong, a national model worker and worker from Fushun, Liu Hongda, a national agricultural model worker and chairman of the Shiyue People's Commune in Suizhong County, and Tong Yulan (female), secretary of the Xiaolizhen Brigade branch of the Zheng'an People's Commune in Beizhen, who were meeting in Shenyang, jointly wrote a letter to the People's Daily, supporting Premier Zhou's reply to Nehru regarding the Sino-Indian border issue and protesting against the Indian government's slander and armed invasion of our country.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 13th: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPPCC invited more than 20 responsible persons from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and figures from all walks of life in the Wuhan area on the afternoon of September 12 to discuss the Sino-Indian border incident.

Zhou Jie, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), said that maintaining Sino-Indian friendship based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is the consistent proposition of the Chinese people. On the Sino-Indian border issue, although the Indian army has repeatedly crossed the border to provoke, our country has exercised great restraint. However, some people with ulterior motives in India have once again launched an anti-China wave under the pretext of the border issue, and the Indian government is also trying to use this to force our country to accept India's unilateral主張 on the Sino-Indian border issue. As one of the founders of the Five Principles, Nehru should know that friendship cannot be obtained under pressure from the other party, and China cannot sacrifice its territory in exchange for friendship.

Tang Zhe, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Committee and Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), said that some politicians and anti-China elements in India are using the Sino-Indian border issue to create anti-China hysteria. We believe that the Chinese and Indian people, who have shared a century of hardships, are closely linked, and will certainly be able to shatter any conspiracy by imperialists and their agents in India to undermine the friendly relations between the two countries.

Chen Jingshe, representative of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference in 1955 and Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, expressed great anger at the Indian government officials, expansionists, right-wing parties, and the newspapers they control for using the Sino-Indian border issue to slander China and even organizing thugs to "demonstrate" in front of the Chinese embassy and consulates, wantonly slandering our country and the anti-China activities of government leaders. Chen Jingshe pointed out: This is a blatant act of undermining Sino-Indian relations and poisoning Sino-Indian friendship, and an activity that violates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese and Indian people should be highly vigilant.

Nie Guoqing, Vice Governor of Hubei Province, Jiang Bingling and Shen Zhaonian, members of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Hu Yimer, a non-party democratic personage, Li Daonan, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Patriotic Association of Catholic, Liu Nianfen, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Patriotic Association of Christian, Chen Yingtong, Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and others also spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the government's solemn position on the Sino-Indian border issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 13th: The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC held a meeting on the 12th to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue. Responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing, responsible persons of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and religious figures who spoke at the meeting fully supported the solemn position, attitude, and principles adopted by our government on the Sino-Indian border issue.

Xia Zhongshi, Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), said that it is well known that the so-called McMahon Line has never been recognized by any central government of our country and has no legal effect whatsoever. The Indian government insists on our country accepting its unilateral主張 and slanders our country of "invading" India, which cannot but make our people feel extremely indignant.

Li Jiazhong, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), said that the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border is entirely caused by the Indian authorities. We want to solemnly warn the Indian authorities: Do not shoot yourself in the foot. The Indian authorities' unwise actions are harming Sino-Indian friendship and will only make "those who are close feel pain, and those who are enemies are happy."

Wang Wenbin, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), said that the Indian authorities insist on using the so-called McMahon Line as the boundary between China and India and exert pressure on our country with various threats, attempting to impose its unilateral主張 on our country, which the 600 million Chinese people will absolutely not allow.

Liu Xilin, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), said that the unwise actions taken by the Indian government on the Sino-Indian border issue only benefit the imperialists.

Fu Jun, Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Shui Xiheng, Chairman of the Chongqing Branch of the Jiusan Society, Wen Shaohe, Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, Jin Xiru, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), Lu Chongyi, member of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the RCCK, Fan Zhongqu, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, Li Muqun, Chairman of the Chongqing Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, and other religious figures also sternly condemned the anti-China movement launched by India.

    天津沈阳武汉重庆各界人民拥护政府对中印边界问题的立场
    严正谴责印度掀起的反华运动
    印度政府应立即撤回越入中国境内的印军和行政人员，使中印边境的紧张局势及早缓和下来。
    据新华社天津13日电　政协河北省委员会和政协天津市委员会今天举行扩大会议，讨论中印边界问题。各民主党派地方组织、各人民团体负责人和各界知名人士在发言中，完全拥护我国政府对中印边界问题所采取的严正立场，并愤怒谴责印度军队侵略我国领土的行为。
    民革河北省委员会主任委员杨亦周说，尼赫鲁在给周总理的信中，充满了荒谬的论点。第一、他强调“传统的疆界是遵循喜马拉雅山山脉峰顶分水岭为界的地理原则的”，这种说法完全是片面的。中国人民从来没有承认过这个界线，怎么能说是“传统的疆界”呢？第二、尼赫鲁强调所谓麦克马洪线是“西姆拉会议决定的”，但是大家都知道，西姆拉会议是英帝国主义侵略中国西藏地方的一个重要步骤，所谓麦克马洪线并未在会议上讨论，西姆拉会议的一切决定和秘密条约，既然没有中国中央政府代表签字，怎么能成为一个有约束力的国际条约呢？民盟天津市委员会主任委员张国藩说，印度反动派掀起的反华运动，只有对帝国主义有利，对印度人民、对东南亚地区的和平没有丝毫好处。我们正告印度反动派，绝不容许你们破坏中印两国人民的传统友谊。民建天津市委员会主任委员朱继圣说，尼赫鲁先生硬要把非法的麦克马洪线强加在中国人民的头上，这是枉费心机。中国人民绝不容许别人把我国的领土分割出去。中国民主促进会天津市委员会主任委员、南开大学校长杨石先说：印度当局继承英帝国主义的不光彩的遗产，妄想侵占我国的领土。印度扩张主义分子颠倒黑白捏造事实掀起反华运动，这不会给印度人民带来任何好处，相反地，只会使帝国主义坐收渔人之利。
    河北省总工会副主席王维奇说，印度扩张主义分子制造中印边境事件，企图侵占我国领土，而且多次纠集暴徒在中国驻印度大使馆和领事馆的门前示威对我们国家和国家领导人横加污蔑，这是不能容忍的。我们河北广大职工，对此表示严正的抗议。我们要求印度政府立即撤回越入中国境内的印军和行政人员，使中印边境的紧张局势及早缓和下来。
    到会的专家、工程师、医生、无党派民主人士以及宗教界人士等，也一致斥责印度反动派在中印边界问题上发出的种种叫嚣。
    印度片面修改中印边界，印军甚至侵入麦克马洪线以北，请看这究竟是谁侵略谁呢？
    据新华社沈阳12日电　辽宁省和沈阳市各界人民完全拥护周恩来总理给尼赫鲁总理复信中关于解决中印边界问题所持的严正立场，对印度某些别有用心的人掀起的新的反华浪潮表示极大愤慨。
    中国人民政治协商会议辽宁省委员会11日召集辽宁省、沈阳市各民主党派、各人民团体负责人以及各界人士讨论中印边界问题。在会上发言的人谴责了印度一些别有用心的人掀起的反华浪潮。民主建国会辽宁省分会主任委员巩天民说：“印度的一些别有用心的政界人士和宣传机关散布大量反华言论，叫嚣中国侵略印度，这完全是颠倒黑白。印度片面修改中印边界，印军甚至侵入麦克马洪线以北，请看这究竟是谁侵略谁呢？印度扩张主义者叫嚷中国侵略了印度，还不是贼喊捉贼吗？”辽宁省佛教协会会长、慈恩寺方丈导尘说：“印度的越界挑衅的行为，违背了佛教教义，我们希望印度应以互相同情、谅解、公平合理的态度解决中印边界问题。”
    在会上发言的人对五项原则创始人之一的尼赫鲁总理，在印度议会上一再颠倒是非，发表中国所谓“侵略”的言论表示极大的遗憾。民盟辽宁省委主任委员陈先舟指出，尼赫鲁竟然要中国接受丧权辱国的领土要求，这不仅永远不能达到目的，而且只会丧失中国人民对他的尊敬。
    沈阳市的广大人民群众也纷纷评论中印边界问题。正在沈阳开会的沈阳市劳动模范、工人出身的工程师王凤恩，全国劳动模范、抚顺市工人李春荣，全国农业劳动模范、绥中县革命十月人民公社社长刘洪达和北镇正安人民公社小李屯大队支部书记佟玉兰（女），联名写信给人民日报，拥护周总理关于中印边界问题给尼赫鲁的复信，对印度政府诬蔑并武装侵犯我国表示抗议。
    共过百年患难的中印两国人民是心连心的，一定可以粉碎帝国主义和它们在印度的代理人破坏两国友好关系的任何阴谋。
    据新华社武汉13日电　政协湖北省委员会12日下午邀请武汉地区各民主党派、各人民团体负责人和各界人士二十多人，讨论中印边界事件。
    民盟湖北省委副主任委员周杰说，根据和平共处五项原则来维持中印友谊是中国人民的一贯主张。在中印边界问题上，虽然印军一再越境挑衅，我国还是做了巨大的克制。而印度一些别有用心的人竟然借口边界问题又一次掀起了反华浪潮，印度政府也企图借此来迫使我国接受印度对中印边界问题的片面主张。作为五项原则创始人之一的尼赫鲁，应当知道友谊是不能在另一方受到压力的情况下获得的，中国更不可能牺牲自己的领土来换取友谊。
    民盟湖北省暨武汉市委员会主任委员唐哲说，印度一些政界人士和反华分子借中印边界问题，制造反华歇斯底里。我们相信：共过百年患难的中印两国人民是心连心的，一定可以粉碎帝国主义和它们在印度的代理人破坏两国友好关系的任何阴谋。
    1955年出席亚非会议的中国代表团代表、湖北省工商联主任委员陈经畬对印度政府人士、扩张主义分子和右翼政党以及他们掌握的报刊，利用中印边界问题大肆污蔑中国，甚至组织暴徒到中国使馆和领事馆门口“示威”，猖狂地污蔑我国和政府领袖的反华活动表示极大愤怒。陈经畬指出：这是一种明目张胆破坏中印关系和毒化中印友谊的行径，是破坏和平共处五项原则的活动，中印人民应引起高度警惕。
    湖北省副省长聂国青，全国政协委员江炳灵、沈肇年，无党派民主人士胡伊默，省天主教友爱国会副主席李道南，省基督教爱国会副主席刘年芬，武汉市归国华侨联合会副主席陈应桐等，也相继在会上发言，他们一致表示坚决拥护政府关于中印边界问题的严正立场。
    印度当局的不明智行动，损害着中印友谊，只会使“亲者痛，仇者快”。
    据新华社重庆13日电　政协重庆市委员会12日举行会议讨论中印边界问题。在会上发言的各民主党派重庆市地方组织负责人、重庆市工商联负责人及宗教界人士，完全拥护和支持我国政府对中印边界问题所采取的严正立场、态度和方针。
    民革重庆市委员会主任委员夏仲实说，众所周知，所谓麦克马洪线从未经过我国任何一个中央政府所承认，是没有任何法律效力的。印度政府硬要我国接受它的片面主张，并含血喷人，污蔑我国“侵略”印度，这不能不令我国人民感到极大愤慨。
    中国民主同盟重庆市委员会副主任委员李嘉仲说，中印边境的紧张局势，完全是印度当局一手造成的。我们要正告印度当局：不要搬石头打自己的脚。印度当局的不明智行动，损害着中印友谊，只会使“亲者痛，仇者快”。
    中国民主建国会重庆市委员会副主任委员王文彬说，印度当局硬要以所谓麦克马洪线作为中印两国的边界，并以种种威胁对我国施加压力，企图以它的片面主张强加于我国，这是六亿中国人民绝对不能容许的。
    中国民主促进会重庆市委员会副主任委员刘西林说，印度政府在中印边界问题上所采取的不明智行动，只对帝国主义者有利。
    中国农工民主党重庆市委员会主任委员傅浚，九三学社重庆分社主任委员税西恒，重庆市工商联主任委员温少鹤，中国民主同盟重庆市委员会副主任委员金锡如，民革重庆市委员会委员鲁崇义，市工商联副主任委员范众渠，重庆市基督教三自爱国会主席李牧群等宗教界人士，也一致严厉谴责印度掀起的反华运动。
