Comrades, friends:

The great People's Republic of China, personally founded and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has triumphantly advanced along the socialist path for nineteen years.

On this glorious occasion, I, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, the Chinese government, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, extend our warmest greetings to the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, People's Liberation Army, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals who have made outstanding contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We also extend our warmest welcome to comrades and friends from all over the world!

At present, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. Except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established in all twenty-nine provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Industry, agriculture, science and technology, and revolutionary literature and art are all flourishing. The counter-revolutionary plot of Chinese Khrushchev and his few agents in various regions to restore capitalism has been thoroughly foiled. After nineteen years of class struggle, especially after this storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our proletarian dictatorship has been tempered and strengthened to an unprecedented degree.

All these victories and achievements are the results of the heroic struggles of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses of the whole country under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao.

Now, the central task before us is to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly. This means we must consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees, carry out thorough criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the Party, carry out educational revolution, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable rules and regulations, and promote production while carrying out the revolution, so as to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Chairman Mao has pointed out: The working class must lead everything. In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, tens of thousands of industrial workers across the country, organized into Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, together with the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, have already or are now advancing into primary and secondary schools and all places where intellectuals congregate, and have taken to the political stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in all domains of the superstructure. This is a great event of the 1960s. Although the time is still short, revolutionary practice has already proven and will continue to prove that the Chinese working class, tempered in long and heroic struggles, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, together with its reliable ally, the poor and lower-middle peasants, and together with the broad masses of revolutionary people, will certainly create even more brilliant achievements!

On behalf of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, I call upon all revolutionary cadres of the proletariat throughout the country to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, continuously create new achievements. At the same time, all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army must always remain vigilant, strengthen military preparedness, defend the country, defend proletarian dictatorship, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must definitely liberate Taiwan and be ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade!

The current international and domestic situation is excellent. The struggles of the revolutionary people of the whole world are surging. The days are not good for the American imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and the reactionaries of all countries. Their reactionary rule will not last long. What awaits them is the total collapse of the old capitalist world and the victory of the proletarian socialist revolution throughout the world.

Workers of the world, unite! Workers of the world, unite with all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations!

Down with American imperialism!
Down with Soviet revisionism!
Down with the reactionaries of all countries!
Smash the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to divide the world!

Long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!
Long live proletarian dictatorship!
Long live the great People's Republic of China!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    在中华人民共和国成立十九周年庆祝大会上
    林彪同志的讲话
    同志们，朋友们：
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和领导的伟大的中华人民共和国，在社会主义的大道上，胜利地走过十九年了。
    在庆祝这个光辉节日的时候，我代表伟大的领袖毛主席，代表党中央、中国政府、中央军委、中央文革，向在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了卓越功勋的工人阶级、贫下中农、人民解放军、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，表示最热烈的问候！向来自世界各国的同志们、朋友们，表示最热烈的欢迎！
    当前，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大胜利。全国除台湾省外，二十九个省、市、自治区，全部成立了革命委员会。工业、农业、科学技术、革命文艺，欣欣向荣。中国赫鲁晓夫及其一小撮在各地区的代理人，妄图复辟资本主义的反革命阴谋，已经彻底破产。我国的无产阶级专政，经过十九年来的阶级斗争，特别是经过这场无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，锻炼得空前巩固、空前强大了。
    所有这一切胜利，这一切成就，都是在我们伟大的领袖毛主席英明领导下，全国亿万革命群众英勇奋斗的结果。
    现在，摆在我们面前的中心任务，就是遵循毛主席的伟大教导，认真搞好斗、批、改。这就是要巩固和发展革命委员会，搞好大批判，搞好清理阶级队伍，搞好整党建党，搞好教育革命，搞好精简机构，改革不合理的规章制度，抓革命、促生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席指出：工人阶级必须领导一切。根据毛主席的指示，全国成千成万的产业工人组成的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，配合人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，已经或者正在开进大、中、小学和一切知识分子成堆的地方，登上了上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台。这是二十世纪六十年代的伟大事件。虽然时间还比较短，但是，革命实践，已经证明并将继续证明，久经英勇战斗的中国工人阶级，在以毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，和他的巩固的同盟者贫下中农在一起，和广大的革命群众在一起，必将创造出更加光辉的功绩！
    我代表以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，号召全国无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中，不断地立新功。同时，中国人民解放军全体指战员，要时刻保持警惕，加强战备，保卫国防，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。我们一定要解放台湾，随时准备消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人！
    当前，国际国内的形势一派大好。全世界革命人民的斗争风起云涌。美帝日子不好过，苏修日子不好过，各国反动派的日子不好过。他们的反革命统治不会长久了。等待着他们的是：资本主义旧世界的全面崩溃，无产阶级社会主义革命走向全世界的胜利。
    全世界无产者联合起来！全世界无产者同被压迫人民、被压迫民族联合起来！
    打倒美帝！
    打倒苏修！
    打倒各国反动派！
    粉碎美帝、苏修勾结瓜分世界的阴谋！
    无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
