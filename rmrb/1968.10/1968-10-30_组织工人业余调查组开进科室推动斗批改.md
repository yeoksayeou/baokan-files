The workers of the Zhangjiakou Coal Mine Machinery Factory, under the support of the factory revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have fully demonstrated the leadership role of the working class during the Cultural Revolution. They organized workers' part-time investigation teams to enter various departments, uniting the revolutionary masses there to conduct thorough investigations, severe criticism, and rapid transformation, significantly accelerating the pace of the struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the factory.

To implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation," workers formed part-time investigation teams to enter departments.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued a series of new instructions such as "the working class must lead everything" and "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation," the workers of the Zhangjiakou Coal Mine Machinery Factory studied them earnestly and promptly implemented them. They resolutely declared that they would complete the great mission entrusted to the working class by the great leader Chairman Mao. The workers of the advanced collective in the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the Machine Workshop's Axle Team 3, took the lead in organizing a workers' part-time investigation team on September 12 to enter the Supply and Marketing Department. Subsequently, the workers of the Assembly Workshop and the Machine Repair Workshop also quickly established workers' part-time investigation teams to enter the Design Research Room and the Inspection Department. These three workers' part-time investigation teams united the revolutionary masses in the departments, conducted thorough investigations and severe criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory, posted the first batch of investigation reports, proposed reform plans, and shocked the entire factory.

The appearance of the workers' part-time investigation teams was highly valued by the factory revolutionary committee and the workers' congress. They immediately posted big-character posters praising the workers' revolutionary actions. The leaders of the factory revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team personally studied Chairman Mao's works with the workers' part-time investigation teams, held discussions, and summarized experiences. They believed that the workers' part-time investigation teams were a product of the workers implementing Chairman Mao's new instructions, a revolutionary innovation of the working class in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and a good method for the factory to continue promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation after sending a large number of outstanding workers to form workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams to enter various units in the superstructure. They should be strongly supported and promoted.

Under the support of the factory revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the workers' part-time investigation teams rapidly developed. By the end of September, the entire factory had established 19 workers' part-time investigation teams, each entering various departments.

The appearance of the workers' part-time investigation teams quickly brought about a new upsurge in the struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the factory, creating a new situation.

The workers' part-time investigation teams entered the departments filled with intellectuals, united the revolutionary masses there, conducted thorough investigations, severe criticism, and rapid transformation, quickly bringing about a new upsurge in the struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the factory, and creating a new situation.

The investigation and research process of the workers' part-time investigation teams was a process of mass revolutionary criticism. Their seminars and investigation meetings were also revolutionary criticism meetings; every investigation report they wrote was a logical, concise, sharp, and powerful revolutionary criticism article. Through their investigation activities, they promoted the revolutionary criticism to develop more deeply.

The workers' part-time investigation teams united the revolutionary masses in the departments, conducted thorough investigations and severe criticism, clearing the way for a thorough reform of all superstructure elements that do not conform to the socialist economic base, and proposed solutions.

The original Design Research Room was filled with intellectuals and was the department with the most complaints from the workers. In the past, some reforms had been made, such as sending a few workers to the intellectuals to form a "three-in-one combination," but the effects were minimal. Workers said it was a "fake three-in-one combination" and that they were "oppressed." Some requested to return to the workshop. After the issuance of Chairman Mao's new instructions, a few people in the Design Research Room still wanted to send workers upstairs to the departments to form a "combination" and were unwilling to go downstairs to the production teams to combine with the workers. The workers' part-time investigation teams entered and conducted investigations and research. They proposed a plan for thorough reform, dismantling this setup, sending intellectuals to the workshops to combine with the workers, and receiving re-education from the working class; combining design and production, with the Assembly Workshop responsible for arranging the design work for the entire factory.

The Inspection Department was also the department with the most complaints from the workers. In the past, the capitalist roaders had said that "inspection personnel enforce the law, workers obey the law, creating opposition to promote production development," thereby increasing the number of personnel. The department grew from five people in 1952 to 81 in 1965. They used cumbersome regulations to control, restrict, and fine the workers, creating a large contradiction between the inspection workers and the production workers. An old worker said, "I have been an inspection worker for 16 years. This inspection department is completely the Soviet revisionist style and should have been abolished long ago. I have been looking forward to returning to the workshop to be a worker!" How should such a department be reformed? Some people could not break free from the old framework and felt that it was "not good to exist, but it's a pity to abolish it." However, the workers' part-time investigation teams clearly pointed out: "Inspection Department, inspection department, class struggle is intense, there are many disputes, a lot of idle time and waste, and it ties the hands of the workers." They proposed to abolish this department and establish a new system where workers voluntarily inspect product quality.

The investigation reports and reform plans proposed by the workers' part-time investigation teams were all as practical and powerful as the above two examples.

The factory revolutionary committee immediately conducted a serious study of the reform plans proposed by the workers' part-time investigation teams and further mobilized the masses to discuss them, promptly implementing the reforms. The 11 investigation reports already written by the workers' part-time investigation teams proposed 28 opinions related to major reforms in the entire factory. Now, 8 relatively large projects have been approved by the revolutionary committee for reform, most of which are "old, large, and difficult" problems like the Design Research Room and the Inspection Department. Because the reforms were carried out quickly, the workers praised, saying, "It's like cutting the Gordian knot." "The revolutionary committee is good, workers' words really count, and long-held wishes have been realized."

Through the organization of part-time investigation teams, the workers' sense of ownership has been greatly enhanced. They have strong revolutionary will and high production enthusiasm, promoting the development of production. The entire factory completed the production task six days ahead of schedule in September, and production has seen new developments in October.

The advantages of organizing workers' part-time investigation teams

Recently, the workers of the Zhangjiakou Coal Mine Machinery Factory summarized the activities of the workers' part-time investigation teams and pointed out that organizing workers' part-time investigation teams has eight advantages.

First, the workers' part-time investigation teams are a good form of mass study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. Through them, one can better study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind and more quickly and seriously implement Chairman Mao's new instructions.

Second, the workers' part-time investigation teams are a good way to fully demonstrate the leadership role of the working class. After the factory sent outstanding workers to form workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various domains of the superstructure, the workers' part-time investigation teams, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, united the revolutionary masses in the departments to solve "old, large, and difficult" problems, giving everyone a place to exert their efforts and being conducive to the "people's war" of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Third, the workers of this factory investigate the affairs of this factory, knowing the situation best and feeling it most deeply, and can grasp the key issues. This is much different from relying solely on the department personnel to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Fourth, the activities of the workers' part-time investigation teams are all conducted in their spare time, with only a few individuals occasionally needing to use production time, and their production tasks are voluntarily taken over by other workers. This fully conforms to Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Fifth, the activities of the workers' part-time investigation teams further promoted the deep development of revolutionary criticism. In the past, workers' understanding of the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the factory was not complete. Through investigations, the cover of class struggle was further lifted, making the understanding more complete and deeper. Carrying out revolutionary criticism became more clear-sighted, logical, and penetrating. In this way, workers' love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line increased, and their hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev deepened. They more clearly recognized what was fragrant, what was foul, what was beneficial, what was harmful, what was socialist, and what was revisionist. The targets and determination for struggle, criticism, and transformation became clearer and greater.

Sixth, the workers' part-time investigation teams are also a large classroom for workers to educate themselves. Through in-depth investigations and research, workers received tempering, raised their awareness, practiced the basic skills of managing the factory, and strengthened their exemplary sense of ownership. They not only investigated others but also conducted self-investigations and reformed where necessary.

Seventh, the workers' part-time investigation teams, through investigations and research, provided favorable conditions for strengthening the re-education of intellectuals. They understood the situation of the intellectuals, had a basis, and had methods; they united and educated revolutionary intellectuals to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, fully demonstrating the working class's ability to lead everything, and prompting intellectuals to decide to learn from the working class.

Eighth, the appearance of the workers' part-time investigation teams strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, which is beneficial for consolidating the newly born revolutionary committee. The broad masses of workers and cadres investigated together, criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line together, researched reform plans together, and carried out reforms together, enhancing revolutionary unity. The revolutionary committee supported the activities of the investigation teams, gaining even more trust from the workers. The revolutionary committee, with the activities of the investigation teams, had a more solid mass foundation for its work and received more powerful supervision and assistance from the workers, making the revolutionary committee deeply rooted among the masses and advancing victoriously along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    张家口煤矿机械厂充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中的领导作用
    组织工人业余调查组开进科室推动斗批改
    厂革委会负责人和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队认为：工人业余调查组是工人们落实毛主席最新指示的产物，是工人阶级在斗批改中的革命创举
    据新华社石家庄二十八日电　张家口煤矿机械厂广大革命工人，在厂革命委员会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的支持下，发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中的领导作用，组织工人业余调查组开进科室，团结那里的革命群众，深查、狠批、快改，大大加速了全厂斗、批、改的步伐。
    落实毛主席关于“认真搞好斗、批、改”的指示，工人组成业余调查组开进科室
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“工人阶级必须领导一切”、“认真搞好斗、批、改”等一系列最新指示以后，张家口煤矿机械厂的广大工人认真学习，迅速落实，坚决表示要胜利地完成伟大领袖毛主席赋予工人阶级的伟大使命。这个厂活学活用毛主席著作先进集体——机工车间轴三组的工人，以搞好斗、批、改为目标，于九月十二日首先组织工人业余调查组，开进了供销科。接着，装配车间和机修车间的革命工人也立即成立工人业余调查组，开进了设计研究室和检查科。这三个工人业余调查组团结科室里的革命群众，深查狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂的代理人推行的一整套反革命修正主义路线，贴出了第一批调查报告，提出了改革方案，震动了全厂。
    工人业余调查组一出现，厂革命委员会和工代会极为重视，马上贴出大字报，赞扬工人的这一革命行动。厂革命委员会负责人和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，亲自与工人业余调查组一道学习毛主席著作，座谈讨论，总结经验。他们认为，工人业余调查组是工人们落实毛主席最新指示的产物，是工人阶级在斗、批、改中的革命创举，是工厂派出大量优秀工人组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上层建筑领域各单位以后，继续搞好工厂里斗、批、改的一个好办法，应该大力支持、推广。
    在厂革委会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的支持下，工人业余调查组迅速发展起来。到九月底，全厂各个车间共成立了十九个工人业余调查组，分别开进了各个科室。
    工人业余调查组的出现使工厂斗、批、改迅速掀起新高潮
    工人业余调查组开进知识分子成堆的各个科室，团结那里的革命群众，深查、狠批、快改，很快使全厂的斗、批、改掀起了新高潮，出现了新局面。
    工人业余调查组的调查研究过程就是一个群众性的革命大批判过程。他们召开的座谈会、调查会，同时就是革命大批判会；他们写的每篇调查报告，都是有理有据、短小精悍、尖锐有力的革命大批判文章。他们通过调查活动，推动了革命大批判更深入地发展。
    工人业余调查组团结科室的革命群众，进行深查、狠批，为彻底改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑扫清了道路，提出了办法。
    原设计研究室知识分子成堆，是全厂工人意见最多的一个科室，过去也做过一些改革，如抽少数工人到知识分子堆里去“三结合”等，但是效果很小。工人说是“假三结合”，“受气”，有的要求回车间。在毛主席最新指示发表以后，设计研究室还有少数人想再抽工人上楼进科室搞“结合”，不愿下楼到班组与工人相结合。工人业余调查组开进去，进行调查研究后，提出了彻底改革的方案，拆掉这个摊子，知识分子到车间与工人结合，接受工人阶级再教育；设计和生产结合，由装配车间负责安排全厂的设计工作。
    检查科也是工人意见最多的一个科室。过去，走资派胡说什么“检查人员执法，工人守法，造成对立面，才能促进生产发展”，因而大量增加人员，全科由一九五二年的五人增加到一九六五年的八十一人，用烦琐的规章制度，对工人实行管、卡、罚，造成检查工与生产工之间很大的矛盾。一个老工人说：“我当了十六年检查工了。这个检查科完全是苏修那一套，早该撤销，我早盼望回车间当工人去！”这样一个科该怎么改？有些人跳不出旧圈子，觉得它“存在不好，砍掉可惜”。但是，工人业余调查组明确地指出：“检查科，检查科，阶级斗争激烈，扯皮的事情最多，窝工浪费惊人，捆绑工人手脚。”他们提出取消这个科，建立一套由工人自觉检查产品质量的新办法。
    工人业余调查组贴出的调查报告，提出的改革方案，都如上述两例一样，切实有力。
    厂革委会对工人业余调查组提出的改革方案立即认真研究，并且进一步发动群众讨论，当即着手改革。工人业余调查组已经写出的十一份调查报告，提出了关系全厂重大改革的意见二十八条，现在已经革委会批准改革的有八个较大项目，其中大部分是象设计研究室和检查科那样的“老、大、难”问题。因为改得快，工人们称赞说：“真是快刀斩乱麻。”“革命委员会就是好，工人说话真顶事，多年的愿望实现了。”
    工人们通过组织业余调查组的活动，主人翁的思想大大发扬了，他们革命意志旺盛，生产干劲十足，推动了生产的发展。全厂九月份提前六天超额完成生产任务，十月份生产又有新的发展。
    组织工人业余调查组的好处
    最近，张家口煤矿机械厂的工人对工人业余调查组的活动进行了一次总结，指出组织工人业余调查组有八大优越性。
    一、工人业余调查组是群众性活学活用毛泽东思想的一种好形式。通过它，能更好地带着问题学习毛主席著作，更迅速更认真地落实毛主席的最新指示。
    二、工人业余调查组是充分发挥工人阶级领导作用的一种好办法。工厂派出优秀工人组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队开到上层建筑各个领域领导斗、批、改以后，工人业余调查组在本厂团结科室革命群众，在革委会领导下，解决“老、大、难”问题，使大家劲头有处使，有利于打斗、批、改的“人民战争”。
    三、本厂工人调查本厂事，情况最明，感受最深，最能抓住要害问题。比光凭科室人员搞斗、批、改，效果大不一样。
    四、工人业余调查组的活动都占业余时间进行，个别人偶尔需要占用生产时间，他的生产任务由其他工人主动地承担，完全符合毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。
    五、工人业余调查组的活动，进一步推动了革命大批判深入发展。过去，工人们对厂里阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的情况，还了解得不那么完整，经过调查，进一步揭开了阶级斗争盖子，认识就完整了，深入了。开展革命大批判，就更加心明眼亮，有理有据，有根有叶，一针见血。这样，工人们对毛主席的革命路线更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线更加仇恨。更清楚地认识到那是香的，那是臭的，那是有益的，那是有害的，那是社会主义的，那是修正主义的，斗、批、改目标更明，决心更大。
    六、工人业余调查组也是工人群众自己教育自己的大课堂。工人们通过深入调查研究，受到了锻炼，提高了觉悟，练了管理工厂的基本功，还增强了以身作则的主人翁思想，他们不仅查别人别事，也进行自查，该改就改。
    七、工人业余调查组通过调查研究，为加强对知识分子进行再教育，提供了有利条件。他们了解了知识分子的状况，有了底码，有了办法；他们团结、教育革命的知识分子认真进行斗、批、改，充分显示了工人阶级能够领导一切的才能，促使知识分子下了向工人阶级学习的决心。
    八、工人业余调查组的出现，密切了干群关系，有利于巩固新生的革委会。广大工人和干部一道调查，一道批判反革命修正主义，一道研究改革方案，一道进行改革，增强了革命团结。革委会支持调查组的活动，更加得到工人群众的信任。革委会有了调查组的活动，工作就有了更扎实的群众基础，并得到工人群众更有力的监督和帮助，使革委会深深扎根于群众之中，沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进。
