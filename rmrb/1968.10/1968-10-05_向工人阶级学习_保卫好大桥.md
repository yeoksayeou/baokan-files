The railway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, designed and constructed by our own country, has successfully opened to traffic. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! It is a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We, the guards of the bridge, shout a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

When we first arrived at the construction site of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, it was a critical moment of intense struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party colluded with a handful of class enemies outside the Party, stirring up a counter-revolutionary wind of economism, attempting to sabotage the construction of the bridge and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In such circumstances, comrades from the working class, with a high level of class struggle and two-line struggle awareness, brandished the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, and struck a heavy blow against the counter-revolutionary wind of economism. Many veteran workers also encouraged young workers to listen to Chairman Mao's words, firmly hold their production posts, and actively work for socialism. The high level of proletarian consciousness and two-line struggle awareness of the working class deeply educated us, giving us a deeper understanding of the struggle between the two lines. Everyone unanimously declared that they would definitely learn from the comrades of the working class, and strive to improve their awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle, becoming steadfast soldiers in executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Thus, we launched an educational campaign to learn from the working class and protect the bridge. On the construction site of the bridge, we often invited comrades from the working class to report on the history of the two-line struggle and, together with the comrades from the working class, criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev. Everyone said: "We guard the bridge for the cause of socialist construction, to support the world revolution! We should be like the comrades of the working class, treating the most difficult and arduous tasks as the testing ground for our loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and as the crucible for tempering our red hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. We should be sentinels who charge forward, fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." No matter how harsh the environment, how heavy the tasks, or how complex the struggles, comrades always braved the difficulties, faced the dangers, and ensured the absolute safety of the bridge.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." The working class is the leader of everything and can lead everything. Since we arrived at the construction site of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, we have lived and worked with the working class, learning many excellent qualities of the working class, and successfully completing all the tasks of guarding the bridge. We are determined to carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution of the working class, to strive harder, to work hard, to stand guard for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to fight in the forefront, and to ensure the absolute safety of the bridge. Let every inch of steel beam, every rivet, and every pier of the bridge be intact, so that the bridge built by our people will stand forever. Let the revolutionary trains of anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism, and support for the world revolution surge forward, forever forward!

    向工人阶级学习  保卫好大桥
    南京长江大桥守护部队
    我国自己设计、自己施工建造的南京长江大桥铁路桥胜利通车了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果！我们大桥警卫战士千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    我们刚刚进驻长江大桥工地时，正是无产阶级文化大革命两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的关键时刻。党内一小撮走资派勾结社会上的一小撮阶级敌人，刮起了一股反革命经济主义的妖风，妄图破坏大桥的建设，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。在这种情况下，具有高度阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟的工人同志们奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，迎头痛击反革命经济主义妖风。许多老工人还鼓励青年工人要听毛主席的话，坚守生产岗位，积极为社会主义劳动。工人阶级高度的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，深深地教育了我们，使我们对两条路线的斗争有了更深刻的理解。大家一致表示，一定要象工人同志们那样，在提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟上狠下功夫，做执行、捍卫毛主席革命路线的坚强战士。
    于是，我们开展了向工人阶级学习、守卫好大桥的教育活动。在大桥工地上，经常请工人同志们报告两条路线斗争史，和工人同志们一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。大家说：“我们守护大桥，是为了社会主义建设事业，是为了支援世界革命！我们应该象工人同志那样，把最困难最艰苦的工作当作检验我们对伟大领袖毛主席忠心的考场，锤炼我们无限忠于毛主席的红心的熔炉，做一名为毛主席革命路线冲锋陷阵，不怕困难，不怕牺牲的哨兵。”不管环境如何艰苦，任务如何繁重，斗争如何复杂，同志们总是顶着困难上，迎着艰险行，保卫大桥的绝对安全。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”工人阶级就是要领导一切，就是能领导一切。我们进驻长江大桥工地以来，与工人阶级朝夕相处，学习了工人阶级的许多优秀品质，胜利地完成了守护大桥的各项战斗任务。我们决心发扬工人阶级的彻底革命精神，再接再厉，艰苦奋斗，为毛主席的革命路线放哨站岗，冲锋打仗，保卫大桥的绝对安全，让大桥的每一寸钢梁，每一颗铆钉，每一个桥墩完好无损，让我国人民建造的大桥万古长存，让反帝、反修，支援世界革命的革命列车奔腾向前，永远向前！
