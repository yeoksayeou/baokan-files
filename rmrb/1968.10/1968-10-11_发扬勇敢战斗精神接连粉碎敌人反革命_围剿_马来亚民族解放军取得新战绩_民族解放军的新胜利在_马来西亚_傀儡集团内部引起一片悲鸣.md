The Malayan National Liberation Army, after achieving a brilliant victory in the battle of Gao Wu in June this year, has once again shattered the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" in July and August, delivering a heavy blow to the reactionary army. The new victories of the National Liberation Army have caused a wave of lamentations within the "Malaysian" puppet regime.

According to a recent issue of the *Malayan News*, the guerrilla units of the National Liberation Army active in the Malayan-Thai border region have launched multiple ambushes on the enemy since early July. On August 15, the guerrillas ambushed a patrol unit of the enemy, killing at least two and wounding nine. The guerrillas suffered no casualties and successfully withdrew after the battle.

On August 17, the reactionary army stepped on a landmine laid by the guerrillas, resulting in the deaths of two soldiers.

The report states that the National Liberation Army has also conducted several successful battles in the eastern and western parts of the border region. On August 15, a unit of the National Liberation Army attacked a joint patrol of the enemy, killing and wounding twelve enemy soldiers.

On August 20, the National Liberation Army ambushed a platoon of the reactionary army. After more than half an hour of fighting, the enemy retreated in disarray, leaving behind a batch of corpses and wounded soldiers.

The report states that the continuous ambushes by the National Liberation Army have struck fear into the hearts of the enemy. On August 26, the Deputy Minister of the Interior of "Malaysia," Hamzah, admitted: "The patrol units of Malaysia are the main targets of the ambushes and have suffered heavy losses." He was forced to confess: "Such ambushes are everywhere, and so far, we have not found a suitable way to avoid them."

The puppet king, prime minister, and deputy prime minister of "Malaysia" all sighed deeply when discussing the severe losses suffered by the reactionary army in the border region on August 31.

The report states that the Rahman puppet regime is increasingly colluding with the Thanom regime in Thailand to jointly suppress the revolutionary armed struggle in the border region. In early July, they implemented "resident registration" in villages on both sides of the Malayan-Thai border, driving many villagers into concentration camps under the guise of "resettlement camps." They have continuously increased their military presence and deployed armored vehicles, aircraft, and other modern weapons during their "encirclement and suppression" of the revolutionary armed forces.

However, the joint military operations of the "Malaysia"-Thai reactionary armies ended in a humiliating defeat.

The report emphasizes that no matter what measures the Rahman-Li Kuan Yew puppets take under the orders of their imperialist masters, the United States and Britain, they cannot stop the revolutionary tide of the armed struggle of the Malayan people.

    发扬勇敢战斗精神接连粉碎敌人反革命“围剿”
    马来亚民族解放军取得新战绩
    民族解放军的新胜利在“马来西亚”傀儡集团内部引起一片悲鸣
    新华社九日讯　据最近一期《马来亚公报》报道，马来亚民族解放军继今年六月在高乌战斗中取得辉煌胜利之后，七、八月份又粉碎了敌人接连发动的“围剿”，狠狠地打击了反动军队。民族解放军的新胜利，在“马来西亚”傀儡集团内部引起了一片悲叹声。
    报道说，活跃在马来亚—泰国边境地区的民族解放军的游击队，从七月初以来，多次伏击敌人。八月十五日，游击队伏击敌人一支巡逻队，至少有两名敌人被打死，另有九名负重伤。游击队没有任何伤亡，在战斗结束后胜利转移。
    八月十七日，反动军队踩响了游击队埋设的地雷，两人被炸死。
    报道说，民族解放军在边境地区的东部和西部也进行了多次胜利的战斗。民族解放军某部在八月十五日袭击了敌人的联合巡逻队，打死打伤敌军十二名。
    八月二十日民族解放军伏击反动军队一个排，经过半个多小时的战斗，敌军拖着一批尸体和伤兵，狼狈而逃。
    报道说，民族解放军连续不断的伏击战，打得敌人胆战心惊。“马来西亚”内政部副部长哈姆扎八月二十六日承认：“马来西亚的巡逻队是袭击的主要目标，遭到了沉重的损失。”他被迫供认：“这种伏击到处都有，到现在为止，我们还没有一种合适的方法来逃避这种伏击。”
    “马来西亚”的傀儡国王、总理和副总理在八月三十一日在谈到反动军队在边境地区遭受严重损失的时候无不长吁短叹。
    报道说，拉赫曼傀儡集团日益加紧同泰国他侬集团勾结，联合镇压边境地区的革命武装斗争。七月初，它们就曾经在马泰边界两边的村子里实行“居民登记”，把许多村民赶进了挂着“重新定居营”招牌的集中营。他们在“围剿”革命武装的时候，不断增派军队，并动用了装甲车、飞机等各种现代化武器。
    然而，“马来西亚”—泰国反动军队的联合军事行动遭到了惨败。
    报道强调说，不管拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡在他们的主子英美帝国主义者命令下采取什么措施，他们都阻挡不了马来亚人民武装斗争的革命浪潮。
