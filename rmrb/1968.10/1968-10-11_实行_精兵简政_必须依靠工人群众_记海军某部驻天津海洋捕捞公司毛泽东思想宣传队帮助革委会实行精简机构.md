The Tianjin Ocean Fisheries Company Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the Navy, has followed Chairman Mao's instructions to rely closely on the worker masses, streamline the organization, reform the old institutions that shackle the masses, and effectively promote the "seize revolution, promote production" movement. The broad revolutionary masses excitedly say: "In the past, the organization was large, the personnel were many, and things were delayed when done; now the organization is small, the personnel are few, and things are done quickly and well."

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this company stubbornly promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line, making the organization of this company bloated and redundant, with personnel exceeding the actual needs. The company originally had one office, two departments, and eighteen sections. Some sections had seven section chiefs, and ordinary sections also had four or five section chiefs, seriously alienating the masses and hindering production development.

Last September, after the Revolutionary Committee was established, three offices were set up to lead the original sections, essentially retaining the original personnel and continuing the old organization.

Workers and sailors criticized, saying: "You have just changed the sign and name, not streamlining the organization or reducing personnel. You are still on the old road."

The Propaganda Team, in response to the above situation, helped the Revolutionary Committee hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class in early June this year, attended by all members of the Revolutionary Committee, the Revolutionary Workers' Committee, and the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the military. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "streamlining and reducing, organizing a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." Everyone realized that thoroughly reforming the old organization is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle for the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to thoroughly criticize the revisionist line that Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, and a great struggle to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The members of the Revolutionary Committee decided to rely closely on the worker masses and thoroughly reform the old organization.

The Propaganda Team and the Revolutionary Committee immediately launched a mass movement across the factory to thoroughly criticize and reform the revisionist old organization and old system, and to establish a new revolutionary organization and system.

The broad worker masses are the direct victims of the old organization, and they hate the revisionist old organization the most. They used their own experiences to expose and criticize the small clique of capitalist roaders in the factory who colluded with the enemy, formed factions, enjoyed privileges, acted as officials, and promoted the "profit-first" and "material incentives" lines, and implemented a whole set of revisionist goods such as controlling, restricting, oppressing, and fining the worker masses.

The broad worker masses criticized one old organization's crimes and proposed one reform plan, with everyone contributing ideas and methods. In just a few days, more than twenty reform plans were proposed. The most distinctive feature of these plans is: breaking at the core of bourgeois dictatorship and establishing at the root of proletarian dictatorship.

The Revolutionary Committee adopted the reform plans proposed by the worker masses, establishing four groups: administrative, political work, production, and logistics. Several responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Committee took charge of these groups, reducing the number of office staff from over two hundred to sixty-four.

However, after streamlining the organization, one person had to do the work of several people in the past. Some cadres worked day and night, busy in the office, busy with accounts, forms, and numbers. The number of people requesting leave for meetings and study sessions increased.

In response to this situation, the Propaganda Team guided everyone to analyze the situation and find the cause. The root of the problem was that the old unreasonable rules and regulations had not been thoroughly abolished.

Initially, only the office staff made some reforms within the old business circle, and the worker masses were still not satisfied. They criticized, saying: "The old sections have been 'cut down,' but their shadows still exist."

The workers pointed out: The old system does not emphasize proletarian politics, does not serve production, but only controls the workers. Once, a sailor used the half-day when the fishing boat was docked to go to the office to exchange a work uniform, passing through three sections and being examined by five cadres before being allowed to exchange. However, they still asked the sailor for a certificate. When the sailor returned to the dock to get the certificate, the office staff had already gone for lunch. When they returned to work and issued the "receipt," the fishing boat's departure time had arrived. The sailor had to go to sea to produce in a broken work uniform, holding the "receipt." In the past, a worker needed to go through two sections and several cadres' hands to get a washer for repairing a machine, just to get a "four-part form." A washer worth two cents, but the "four-part form" cost much more. He angrily said: "This is not revolution, but digging at the foundations of socialism!"

The broad worker and sailor masses summarized three major harms of the old rules and regulations: first, not emphasizing proletarian politics and wasting national resources; second, tying the hands of cadres, making them unable to leave the office, alienating them from the masses and production reality; third, putting "control" first, with complicated procedures, affecting production.

The broad cadres learned deeply from the worker masses, realizing that formulating and implementing what kind of rules and regulations seems to be a matter of management methods and work methods, but in essence, it is a sharp struggle between two classes and two lines. Different rules and regulations reflect different natures of political power. The old rules and regulations that shackle the worker masses are the products of the revisionist line, the products of old ideas and old styles. They, in turn, are the "protective charms" that allow revisionism to be promoted and old ideas and old styles to "legally" exist.

On this basis, the Revolutionary Committee organized a three-in-one reform group with worker participation, fully playing the leading role of the working class. The three-in-one reform group, based on the principle of emphasizing the leadership of the working class, being conducive to production, and convenient for the worker masses, led everyone to thoroughly criticize the old rules and regulations and establish new revolutionary rules and regulations. The logistics group alone has made more than twenty major reforms so far.

This company purchases one thousand cubic meters of timber every year. In the past, it was managed by three sections, with timber scattered everywhere, blown by the wind and sun, and wasted greatly. The worker masses proposed improvements every year, but the problem remained unsolved and became a "chronic problem." Carpenter Song Huazhi took the initiative to propose that, except for ship repair materials, all timber be managed by the carpentry group. The Revolutionary Committee adopted this suggestion, organizing some cadres to collect timber and store it in the carpentry group. In just a few days, the timber was organized, and the collected wooden boards alone were worth about eight hundred yuan, saving the state a large amount of funds.

In the past, the self-repair of fishing boats was a single responsibility system for technicians, often resulting in missed repairs. Now, a three-in-one inspection and repair group consisting of workers, sailors, and technicians is responsible for the inspection and repair. Because the sailors are most familiar with the boats and machinery they use, and the workers have the most practical experience in repairs, this speeds up the ship repair process, ensures the quality of ship repairs, saves a large amount of funds, and fully meets the principles of "more, faster, better, cheaper."

Breaking the revisionist old organization and old system, establishing a new revolutionary organization and system, has promoted the revolutionary construction of the Revolutionary Committee and promoted the "seize revolution, promote production" movement.

The Revolutionary Committee often keeps three-quarters of its members in the grassroots, in the fishing fleet, and on the production frontline. They put the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought and the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters at the forefront of all work. Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary cadre Zhou Changwen, when he went to Qingdao, visited all the fishing boats in the port, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions were conveyed overnight, and that everyone studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions without exception, bringing about a new situation in the revolution and production. The sailors said: "The cadres have gone deep into the ship's hold, and the leadership style has changed greatly. Now the leaders think and work with us."

Once, the Revolutionary Committee received a telegram from a returning fishing boat saying that the fish fry at sea were good and requested the immediate organization of personnel to prepare for the repair of fishing nets to ensure continuous operations. The Revolutionary Committee immediately organized land workers and cadres, and as soon as the fishing boat docked, they rushed to repair it, ensuring that the fishing boat could set sail on time.

By the end of August, the total production cost of this company compared to the same period last year had been reduced by more than 480,000 yuan.

In the face of a great situation, the Propaganda Team timely proposed to the Revolutionary Committee not to be satisfied with the status quo, as satisfaction would lead to stagnation, and stagnation would lead to falling behind. The members of the Revolutionary Committee, in close contact with the broad worker masses, humbly learned the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class, often soliciting the opinions of the worker masses on further improving the streamlining and reducing work. They are determined to advance along the path of streamlining and reducing as indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao! Forever advance!

    实行“精兵简政”必须依靠工人群众
    记海军某部驻天津海洋捕捞公司毛泽东思想宣传队帮助革委会实行精简机构
    天津海洋捕捞公司革委会，在海军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照毛主席的教导，紧紧依靠工人群众，精简机构，改革束缚群众手脚的旧制度，有力地推动了“抓革命，促生产”。广大革命群众兴奋地说：“过去是机构大，人员多，办起事来推又拖；现在是机构小，人员少，办起事来快又好。”
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在这个公司的代理人顽固地推行反革命修正主义企业管理路线，使这个公司的机构臃肿庞大，组织重叠，人浮于事。公司原设有一处、二室、十八科。有的科设有科长七人，一般的科也有四、五个科长，严重脱离群众，妨碍生产发展。
    去年九月，革委会成立后，设立了三个办公室，分别领导原有科室，实际上是保持原班人马，沿袭旧的机构。
    工人和船员群众批评说：“你们这是换了招牌改了名，不简机构不减人。你们走的还是老路。”
    宣传队针对上述情况，于今年六月初帮助革委会举办了革委会、革命职工委员会、驻军毛泽东思想宣传队全体成员参加的毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习了毛主席关于“精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导。大家认识到，彻底改革旧机构是一场无产阶级反对资产阶级的斗争，是工人阶级和广大革命群众彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的修正主义路线，是巩固无产阶级专政的伟大斗争。革委会成员决心紧紧依靠工人群众，彻底改革旧机构。
    发动群众，大破修正主义的旧机构、旧制度，大立革命的新机构、新制度
    认识统一后，宣传队和革委会立即在全厂掀起了一个大破修正主义旧机构、旧制度，大立革命的新机构、新制度的群众运动。
    广大工人群众是旧机构的直接受害者，他们对修正主义的旧机构最痛恨。他们以自己的亲身经历揭发批判了厂里的一小撮走资派招降纳叛，结党营私，养尊处优，做官当老爷，推行“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”，对工人群众大搞管、卡、压、罚等一整套修正主义货色。
    广大工人群众批判一项旧机构的罪状，提一项改革的方案，人人出主意、想办法，短短几天时间，就提出了二十多个改革方案。这些方案的最大特点是：破在资产阶级专政的要害上，立在无产阶级专政的根本上。
    革委会采纳了工人群众提出的方案，建立了办事、政工、生产、后勤四个组，革委会几个负责同志分别担任组长，机关干部由原来的二百多人减至六十四人。
    但是，精简机构后，一个人顶过去几个人的工作，有些干部昼夜加班，忙在办公室里，忙在帐簿、表册、数目字上。开会、学习时，请假的人越来越多。
    针对这种情况，宣传队又引导大家分析情况，寻找原因。原来根子就在旧的不合理的规章制度还没有彻底破除。
    起初，只是机关干部在旧业务的圈子里作了些改革，改来改去，工人群众还是不满意。他们批评说：“旧的科室‘砍’掉了，影子还存在。”
    工人们指出：旧制度根本不突出无产阶级政治，不为生产服务，只是为了卡工人。有一次，一位船员利用渔船靠码头的半天时间，到机关换领一件工作服，进出三个科，经过五个干部“审查”后，认为可以换领。可是，又向这个船员要证明信。等这个船员跑回码头拿来证明信，机关工作人员又下班午休了。等到上班开好“领物单”，渔轮出港时间已到。这个船员只好身穿破工作服、怀揣“领物单”出海生产。过去一位工人为领一个修机器用的垫片，要跑两个科，经过几个干部的手，才能开个“四联单”。一个垫片只值二厘钱，那张“四联单”却大大超过了二厘钱。他气愤地说：“这那里是革命，简直是在挖社会主义的墙脚！”
    广大工人、船员给旧规章制度归纳了三大害处：一是不突出无产阶级政治，浪费国家财产；二是捆住干部的手脚，使他们走不出办公室，脱离群众，脱离生产实际；三是“卡”字当头，手续烦琐，影响生产。
    广大干部从工人群众身上受到深刻教育，他们认识到，制订和实行什么样的规章制度，看来是管理方法、工作方法问题，实质上是一场两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争。不同的规章制度，反映着不同的政权性质。旧的束缚工人群众的规章制度，是修正主义路线的产物，是旧思想、旧作风的产物。它反过来又是修正主义得以推行，旧思想、旧作风得以“合法”存在的“护身符”。
    在此基础上，革委会组织了有工人参加的三结合的改革小组，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用。三结合改革小组本着突出工人阶级领导，有利生产，方便工人群众的原则，带领大家大破旧的规章制度，大立革命的新制度。仅后勤组，目前已作出了二十多项较大的改革。
    这个公司每年都要购进木材一千立方米。过去由三个科经管，木材杂乱散放，四处皆是，风吹日晒，浪费极大。工人群众年年提意见，年年改不了，成了个“老大难”问题。木工宋化民主动提出，除修船用材外，统由木工组经管。革委会接受了这个意见，组织部分干部收集木材存放在木工组，几天之内，就弄得有头有绪，仅收集的木板一项就值八百元左右，为国家节省了大量资金。
    过去渔轮自修是技术员单一负责制，经常出现漏修项目，现在由工人、船员、技术员组成三结合的检修组负责检修。由于船员对自己所使用的船只、机器设备最熟悉，工人对修理最有实践经验，这就加快了修船速度，保证了修船质量，节约了大量资金，完全符合“多、快、好、省”的原则。
    学习工人阶级的彻底革命精神，在精兵简政道路上不断前进
    破了修正主义旧机构、旧制度，建立了革命的新机构、新制度，就促进了革命委员会的革命化建设，推动了“抓革命，促生产”。
    革委会经常保持四分之三的委员深入基层、深入船队、深入生产第一线。他们把宣传毛泽东思想，贯彻落实毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，放在一切工作的首位。革委会副主任、革命领导干部周长文深入青岛收港点时，走遍港内的所属渔轮，做到传达毛主席最新指示不过夜，学习毛主席最新指示不漏人，使革命和生产出现了新气象。船员说：“干部深入到船舱，领导作风大变样。现在领导和我们想在一起，干在一起了。”
    一次，革委会收到返航渔轮的电报，说海上鱼苗很好，要求迅速组织人员，准备抢修鱼网，以便连续作战。革委会立即组织陆地工人和干部，渔轮一靠码头，立即抢修，保证了渔轮及时出港。
    截至八月底，这个公司的生产总成本与去年同期相比，降低了四十八万余元。
    在一片大好形势面前，宣传队又及时向革委会提出，不要满足于现状，满足就会止步，止步就会落后。革委会成员在和广大工人群众的密切联系中，虚心学习工人阶级彻底革命的精神，经常征求工人群众对进一步搞好精兵简政的意见。他们决心沿着伟大领袖毛主席指示的精兵简政的道路不断前进！永远前进！              红海城
