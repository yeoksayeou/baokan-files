The armed struggle of Indian peasants in Naxalbari has ignited the torch of peasant revolution, promoting the development of the peasant movement. Today, peasant movements are surging across India, fiercely striking at the foundation of the Indian reactionary regime. Over the past year, in about fifty regions across ten states in India, Naxalbari-style peasant movements have erupted. We enthusiastically hail this excellent situation in the Indian revolution.

Our great teacher, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally applicable, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." The revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India clearly points out that the Indian revolution must take the path of establishing rural base areas, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and seizing political power through armed struggle.

However, the Soviet revisionist clique and the Danji revisionist clique in India, along with the Indian Communist revisionists, vigorously advocate the "parliamentary road" of peaceful transition, opposing armed struggle.

They say: India's "national conditions" do not suit a revolution like China's, where the countryside surrounds the cities and political power is seized through armed struggle.

Is this really the case? Are India's "national conditions" really so special? India is a backward agricultural country where peasants make up the vast majority of the population. India is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country. The broad masses of the people are oppressed by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, living in a hellish existence, worse than cattle. The Indian big landlords and big capitalists, collaborating with imperialism externally and oppressing the people internally, are the sworn enemies of the Indian people. Now, Indian peasants are taking up arms to overthrow the mountains of oppression on their heads and to overthrow their class enemies who oppress and exploit them. Their revolutionary actions are excellent! Excellent!

They also propagate that the "political awareness of Indian workers and peasants is extremely low." In their view, Indian workers and peasants are incapable of anything, only the bourgeoisie is capable. This is a slander against the broad masses of Indian workers and peasants. The revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, by going deep into the countryside and initiating peasant armed struggle, fully demonstrates the leadership role of the Indian proletariat. As long as the Indian proletariat truly grasps Marxism-Leninism and seriously applies Marxism-Leninism to the specific practice of the Indian revolution, they can lead the Indian revolution to victory. The Indian revolution must be led by the proletariat. As for the Indian peasants, they have already shown their immense revolutionary potential. Those Indian "parliamentary dreamers" who carry briefcases and wander about, what right do you have to dictate to the Indian proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary peasants!

They also accuse the Indian peasant armed struggle of being "adventurism." Meaning that the revolutionary moment is not ripe, and thus anyone who rises up in revolution is an "adventurist" and "extremist." These hackneyed phrases, revolutionary people have long been familiar with and are tired of hearing. I ask, what kind of moment are you talking about, Indian revisionist gentlemen? Now, the Indian working people are suffering under the heavy oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and they urgently need to rise up in revolution to overthrow the oppression of the three mountains and liberate themselves, with a pent-up fire burning within them to fight to the death with the enemy. Now, India is on the eve of revolutionary storms and tempests, with the whole country like a pile of dry wood, ready to ignite at the slightest spark. The revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India goes to the countryside to fan the flames of revolution, ignite the fires of rebellion, and has sparked a thriving peasant movement, completely shattering the revisionists' counter-revolutionary slanders against the peasant movement.

The various arguments of the revisionists against peasant armed struggle are all aimed at deceiving the people and creating public opinion for the "parliamentary road" they advocate. However, no matter what means the revisionists use to deceive the masses, their disguises will eventually be torn off.

The so-called "parliamentary road" is to not have a revolution, to betray the revolution, to not allow the laboring masses to be liberated, and to allow the dictatorship of the big landlords and big capitalists to continue in India. The proletariat and revolutionary people have no power of their own, while the reactionary classes have a complete state apparatus to carry out class oppression, killing and beheading people at will. The Indian parliament is a tool of the big landlords and big capitalists. How can one imagine that the big landlords and big capitalists would allow the proletariat to seize power through ballots? Under the dictatorship of the big landlords and big capitalists in India, there is absolutely no way for the proletariat and laboring masses to survive. Advocating the use of ballots rather than guns to seize power is to hand over the fate of India's hundreds of millions of people to the big landlords and big capitalists, to be subjected to the oppression and slavery of imperialism and reactionaries. The Indian revisionists peddling the "parliamentary road" and the so-called "non-Congress government road" completely expose themselves as obstacles to the Indian revolution, as servants and henchmen of the big landlords and big capitalists.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In China, without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution."

In India, it is the same. Only by mobilizing the peasant masses, establishing people's armed forces, using the countryside as a base, and persisting in long-term armed struggle, can the Indian revolution achieve victory. This is the only correct path.

### 印度农民革命武装斗争好得很

    印度农民革命武装斗争好得很
    沈阳部队某连队战士　郑察廉
    印度纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争的星星之火，点燃了农民革命的火把，推动了农民运动的发展。今天印度各地的农民运动风起云涌，猛烈地冲击着印度反动派的统治基础。一年多以来，全印度十几个邦中，已有八个邦约五十个地区爆发了纳萨尔巴里式的农民运动。我们热烈欢呼印度革命的这一大好形势。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”印共革命派明确指出，印度革命，坚决要走建立农村根据地、以农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的道路。
    但是苏修叛徒集团和印度的丹吉叛徒集团、印共修正主义分子竭力鼓吹和平过渡的“议会道路”，反对武装斗争。
    他们说：印度的“国情”不适合象中国革命那样以农村包围城市、武装夺取政权。
    难道事实真是这样的吗？印度的“国情”难道真是那样特殊吗？印度是个落后的农业国，农民占人口的绝大多数。印度是半殖民地半封建国家。广大人民被帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山压得喘不过气来，劳苦大众处于水深火热之中，过着牛马不如的生活。印度的大地主大资产阶级对外勾结帝国主义，对内镇压人民，是印度人民的死对头。现在，印度农民拿起武器，要推翻压在他们头上的大山，要打倒压迫和剥削他们的阶级敌人。他们的革命行动好得很！好极了！
    他们又宣传说：印度工人农民的“政治觉悟非常低”。在他们看来，印度的工人和农民，这也不行，那也不行，只有资产阶级行。这是对印度广大工农的诬蔑。印共革命派深入农村，发动农民的革命武装斗争，就充分体现了印度无产阶级的领导作用。印度的无产阶级只要真正掌握了马克思列宁主义，认真做到马克思列宁主义同印度革命的具体实践相结合，他们就能够领导印度革命走向胜利。印度的革命必须由无产阶级来领导。至于印度的农民，早已显示了他们的巨大的革命潜力。那些夹着皮包游游荡荡的印度“议会迷”们，你们有什么权利对印度的无产阶级革命派和革命农民指手划脚！
    他们还指责印度农民的武装斗争是什么“冒险主义”。意思是说，革命的时机没有成熟，因此谁起来革命，谁就是“冒险主义”、“极端分子”。他们的这些陈词滥调，革命人民早就领教过，而且听得不耐烦了。试问，印度修正主义老爷们，你们说的时机是什么时机？现在印度的劳动人民饱受着帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山的沉重压迫，他们迫切要求起来革命，要求推翻三座大山的压迫，翻身解放，内心蕴藏着一股压抑不住的和敌人血战到底的烈火。现在的印度正处在革命的暴风骤雨的前夜，全国象布满干柴，革命烈火一触即发。印共革命派到农村去煽革命之风，点造反之火，掀起了蓬蓬勃勃的农民运动，这就完全粉碎了修正主义者诬蔑农民运动的反革命谬论。
    修正主义者反对农民革命武装斗争的种种论调，都是为着欺骗人民的，都是为着替他们所鼓吹的“议会道路”制造舆论的。但是，不管修正主义者用什么手段来蒙蔽群众，他们的伪装总是要被剥去的。
    所谓“议会道路”，就是不要革命，背叛革命，就是不让劳苦大众得到解放，而让大地主大资产阶级的专政在印度继续下去。无产阶级和革命人民没有自己的政权，而反动阶级手里则有一整套国家机器，用来进行阶级镇压，对人民要杀就杀，要砍就砍。印度议会是大地主大资产阶级的御用工具。怎么能够设想，大地主大资产阶级允许无产阶级通过选票来取得政权呢？在印度大地主大资产阶级的专政之下，绝不可能有无产阶级和劳苦大众的活路。鼓吹用选票，而不是用枪杆子来取得政权，就是把印度亿万人民的命运交给大地主大资产阶级，听凭帝国主义和反动派的压迫和奴役。印修分子贩卖“议会道路”和所谓“非国大党政府”的道路，完全暴露了他们是印度革命的绊脚石，是大地主大资产阶级的奴仆和爪牙。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”
    在印度，也是这样。只有放手发动农民群众，建立人民武装力量，以农村为根据地，坚持长期的武装斗争，才是印度革命取得胜利的唯一正确的道路。
