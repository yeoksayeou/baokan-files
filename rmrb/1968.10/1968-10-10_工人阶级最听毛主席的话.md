The working class listens most to Chairman Mao's words

The head of the Revolutionary Committee of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau and the commander of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, Xue Yunzhong

Chinese Khrushchev has always denied the leading role of the working class. He once viciously shouted that the working class is "uncooperative" and "unreliable." This is a thorough and complete revisionist fallacy!

What nonsense that the working class is "uncooperative"! In a class society, people are class people, and the "words" they speak are class-based. Whether to listen to someone or not is determined by one's worldview and class stance. Over the past two years, while we have been carrying out the task of supporting the left in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, we have deeply felt that the working class has the highest proletarian consciousness and the firmest stance. They resolutely do not listen to the set of revisionist fallacies spread by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, not only do they not listen, but they also resolutely resist and launch a revolutionary criticism, eliminating their poison! They study Chairman Mao's latest instructions most seriously, understand them most deeply, propagate them most actively, implement them most resolutely, and act most swiftly. As long as we firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions and rely on the strength of the working class, we can overcome all enemies and difficulties and continuously achieve new victories!

In June of this year, after Chairman Mao's latest instruction on the "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie" was issued, the revolutionary workers of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau responded swiftly and resolutely carried it out, launching a magnificent struggle against the enemy. However, some members of the Revolutionary Committee did not fully understand Chairman Mao's latest instruction and had the idea of simply seeking "stability," believing that the Fengfeng Mining Bureau and its twenty-one affiliated units had all established revolutionary committees, achieving a "red sea," and that the struggle against the enemy was too "intense," which would affect the "red sea." In response to this situation, the workers pointed out sharply: whether one understands and resolutely carries out Chairman Mao's instructions, or whether one does not yet fully understand but still resolutely carries them out, is the fundamental criterion for measuring loyalty to Chairman Mao; although the Fengfeng Mining Bureau has achieved a "red sea," it appears to be "calm," but class struggle does not change with one's will. The class enemies hide deeper and act more cunningly. They are always waiting for an opportunity to make a desperate struggle. We must continue to uncover the cover of class struggle, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy, so that the Revolutionary Committee can continue to develop and consolidate in the storm of class struggle. The Revolutionary Committee humbly accepted the workers' criticism, walked out of the offices and offices, wore straw hats, and fought with the workers on the front line of class struggle, together with them, to firmly grasp class struggle, and launched a magnificent revolutionary criticism against the revisionist fallacies such as "class struggle is extinguished," "experts manage the factory," and "technology first" spread by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. As the workers analyzed, a handful of class enemies, in order to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee, spread rumors and created divisions among the three representatives of revolutionary cadres, the army, and revolutionary masses: they spoke ill of the revolutionary mass representatives in front of the revolutionary cadre representatives, and slandered the revolutionary cadre representatives in front of the revolutionary mass representatives. Because the members of the Revolutionary Committee deeply rooted themselves among the masses and firmly grasped class struggle, they timely exposed the tricks of the class enemies. After mobilizing the broad masses of workers, they quickly exposed a handful of stubborn class enemies, traitors, spies, remnants of the Kuomintang, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, as well as counter-revolutionaries who attempted to sabotage the mine. They severely struck the class enemies, and the revolution and production presented a prosperous and thriving situation. The Revolutionary Committee was further consolidated and developed in the storm of class struggle. The reality of class struggle educated the members of the Revolutionary Committee, making them deeply realize that the working class understands Chairman Mao's instructions most deeply and carries them out most resolutely; the reason why we do not fully understand is that we are not close enough to the working class, do not rely on them resolutely enough, and our roots are not deep enough.

A drop of water can reflect the sun. From this example, we can see that the working class loves Chairman Mao the most and listens to Chairman Mao's words the most, and they believe and carry out Chairman Mao's instructions without doubt. Chinese Khrushchev slanders the working class as having "low consciousness" and being "uncooperative," which is an attempt to make the working class go against the orders of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters and act according to his manipulations, serving his restoration of capitalism. We must thoroughly criticize and expose Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist fallacy of attempting to abolish the leadership of the working class. We must seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, firmly believe in the working class, and wholeheartedly rely on the working class. Under the orders of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, we will achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 工人阶级最听毛主席的话

    工人阶级最听毛主席的话
    峰峰矿务局革委会主任解放军某部团长  薛蕴忠
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯否定工人阶级的领导作用。他曾经恶狠狠地叫嚷什么：工人阶级“不听话”，“是不能依靠的”。这是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义谬论！
    什么工人阶级“不听话”！在阶级社会里，人都是阶级的人，说的“话”都是有阶级性的。听谁的话，不听谁的话，都是由世界观决定，由阶级立场决定的。两年来，我们在峰峰矿务局担任支左任务中，深深感到，工人阶级的无产阶级觉悟最高，立场最坚定，他们对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人散布的一套反革命修正主义谬论，就是坚决不听，不但不听，而且坚决抵制，展开革命大批判，肃清其流毒！他们对伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，学习最认真，理解最深透，宣传最积极，贯彻最坚决，行动最迅速。只要坚定不移地按照毛主席的指示办事，依靠工人阶级的力量，就能战胜一切敌人，克服一切困难，不断夺取新的胜利！
    今年六月，毛主席关于“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示下达后，峰峰矿务局革命工人闻风而动，坚决执行，开展了轰轰烈烈的对敌斗争。但革委会个别成员对毛主席的最新指示还不够理解，有单纯求“稳”的思想，认为峰峰矿务局及所属二十一个单位都建立了革命委员会，实现了“一片红”，对敌斗争搞“猛”了，对“一片红”会有影响。针对这种情况，工人群众十分尖锐地指出：对毛主席的指示，是不是理解的坚决执行，暂时还不太理解的也坚决执行，这是衡量忠不忠于毛主席的根本标志；峰峰矿务局虽然实现了“一片红”，表面看起来是“风平浪静”，但是阶级斗争是不以人的意志为转移的，阶级敌人隐蔽得更深，活动更狡猾了。他们随时都在等待时机，准备作垂死的挣扎，我们只有继续揭开阶级斗争的盖子，深入持久地开展革命大批判和对敌斗争，革委会才能够在阶级斗争的风暴中不断发展巩固。革委会虚心听取了工人们的批评，纷纷走出科室、办公室，戴着柳条帽，同工人一起在阶级斗争第一线上摸爬滚打，一起狠抓阶级斗争，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，“专家治厂”，“技术第一”等反革命修正主义谬论，展开了波澜壮阔的革命大批判。事实也正如工人群众分析的那样，一小撮阶级敌人为了颠覆新生的革命委员会，在革命干部、军队、革命群众三方面代表之间，散布谣言，制造分裂：在革命干部代表面前说革命群众代表的坏话，在革命群众代表面前极力诬蔑革命干部代表。由于革委会成员深深扎根于群众之中，狠抓阶级斗争，及时识破了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，在广大工人群众发动起来以后，很快就揪出了一小撮顽固不化的走资派和隐藏很深的叛徒、特务、国民党的残渣余孽，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，同时也抓出了妄图破坏矿井的反革命分子，狠狠打击了阶级敌人，革命、生产出现了欣欣向荣的蓬勃局面，革委会在阶级斗争的风浪中进一步得到了巩固、发展。阶级斗争的现实教育了革委会成员，使大家深刻认识到，工人阶级理解毛主席的指示最深透，执行最坚决；我们之所以不够理解，是由于和工人阶级心贴得不够紧，依靠得不够坚决，根子扎得不深的缘故。
    一滴水可以见太阳。我们从这个事例里可以看出，工人阶级最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，对毛主席的指示都是坚信不疑，彻底照办。中国赫鲁晓夫诬蔑工人阶级“觉悟不高”，“不听话”，就是妄想使工人阶级违背毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令，一切行动听他的摆布，为他复辟资本主义服务。我们一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫妄图取消工人阶级领导的反革命修正主义谬论，彻底批深批透。认真学习、深刻领会毛主席的最新指示，坚定不移地相信工人阶级，全心全意地依靠工人阶级，在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令下，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
