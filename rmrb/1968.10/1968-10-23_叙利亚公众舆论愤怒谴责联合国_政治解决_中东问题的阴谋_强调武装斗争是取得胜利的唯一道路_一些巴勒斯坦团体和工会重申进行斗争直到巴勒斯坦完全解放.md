Syrian public opinion continues to denounce the criminal conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to push so-called "political solutions" to the Middle East problem, and expresses its determination to engage in armed struggle to recover the Arab lands seized by U.S. imperialism's tool, Israel. On the 15th, 20,000 members of the Syrian People's Army marched in Aleppo, a major city in northern Syria, to denounce the criminal conspiracy of a "political solution" to the Middle East problem, and to express their resolve to fight to the end against U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israeli Zionism. During the march, they carried banners with slogans such as: "Armed struggle is the only path to our victory," "People's liberation war is the only path to liberate the occupied lands," and "The masses are the true foundation of the revolution."

The Damascus Radio station issued a commentary on the 20th, stating that for the past 16 months, the so-called "peaceful solutions" to the Middle East problem have failed because these solutions demand that the Arab people surrender to imperialism and Zionism. The commentary pointed out that the United Nations is controlled by imperialist countries. Now, these countries, which support Israel's invasion of Arab countries, are busy with fruitless debates in the United Nations to gain time to prepare for new invasions.

The Syrian newspaper *Al-Thawra* published an editorial on the 19th, stating: "The imperialist countries led by the United States are exerting various pressures in the United Nations to secure the maximum benefits for the Zionist aggressor authorities." The Syrian newspaper *Al-Ba'ath* published a commentary on the 15th, pointing out that the Arab people will not allow anyone to compromise on their struggle. They know how to punish those who betray them and conspire against them.

According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency in Damascus on the 21st, some Palestinian people's organizations and unions, after a meeting in Damascus on the evening of the 18th, sent a telegram to the Palestinian commando organizations that issued a joint statement in Amman on the 15th, expressing their support for their statement denouncing the so-called "political solution" to the Middle East problem and rejecting the United Nations Security Council's "resolution" on the Middle East problem.

The telegram said that the Palestinian people's organizations and unions that met in Damascus oppose all "peaceful solutions" that seek to cancel the Palestinian cause and the sacred rights of the Palestinian people on all their lands, and assure you: no matter how long it takes and how great the sacrifices, they will continue the struggle until the complete liberation of Palestine.

    叙利亚公众舆论愤怒谴责联合国“政治解决”中东问题的阴谋
    强调武装斗争是取得胜利的唯一道路
    一些巴勒斯坦团体和工会重申进行斗争直到巴勒斯坦完全解放
    据新华社大马士革二十日电　叙利亚公众舆论继续谴责美帝国主义加紧推行所谓“政治解决”中东问题的罪恶阴谋，并表示坚持进行武装斗争来收复被美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列所强占的阿拉伯土地。二万名叙利亚人民军十五日在叙利亚北部大城市阿勒颇举行游行，谴责“政治解决”中东问题的罪恶阴谋，并且表示决心同美帝国主义及其走狗以色列犹太复国主义斗争到底。他们在游行时举着横幅标语，上面写着：“武装斗争是我们取得胜利的唯一道路”、“人民解放战争是我们解放被占领的土地的唯一道路”和“人民群众是革命的真正基础”。
    大马士革电台二十日发表评论说，十六个月来，关于中东问题的所谓“和平解决办法”失败了，因为这种解决办法是要阿拉伯人民向帝国主义和犹太复国主义投降。评论指出，联合国是由帝国主义国家控制的。现在，这些支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的国家，要联合国忙于进行没有成果的辩论，以便获得时间来准备新的侵略。
    叙利亚《革命报》十九日发表社论说：“以美国为首的帝国主义国家在联合国中施加种种压力，为犹太复国主义侵略当局捞取最大的好处。”叙利亚《复兴报》十五日发表评论指出，阿拉伯人民将不允许任何人在他们的斗争问题上搞妥协。他们懂得如何惩罚那些背叛他们和阴谋反对他们的人。
    据新华社大马士革二十一日电　据阿拉伯叙利亚通讯社报道，一些巴勒斯坦人民团体和工会，十八日晚上在大马士革开会后，打电报给那些十五日在安曼发表联合声明的巴勒斯坦突击队组织，表示支持它们谴责所谓“政治解决”中东问题的声明，拒绝联合国安理会关于中东问题的“决议”。
    电报说，在大马士革开会的一些巴勒斯坦人民团体和工会反对企图取消巴勒斯坦事业和取消巴勒斯坦人民在其全部土地上的神圣权利的一切“和平解决”办法，并向你们保证：不论需要多长的时间和需要作出多大的牺牲，也要继续进行斗争，直到实现巴勒斯坦的完全解放。
