Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out deeply: "Those educated in the old schools, the majority or a large number of them, can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some have made inventions and creations. However, they must be under the correct leadership and receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's brilliant directive has shown the revolutionary intellectuals and cultural warriors the only correct path and an unlimited bright future. We, the young cultural warriors, have a deep personal experience of the harm caused by the revisionist education system of the old schools. Reflecting on the life in the old schools and the process of creating and performing the ballet "White-Haired Girl," we have a deeper understanding of the absolute correctness and greatness of Chairman Mao's latest directive.

Under the rule of the bourgeoisie, the old dance schools, under the guidance of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational and cultural lines, vigorously promoting the "special" theory of dancers, using excuses like "at the beginning of each semester, one cannot go down for classes; in the middle of the semester, it is the time for long exercises, one cannot go down; at the end of the semester, there are exams, one cannot go down" to prevent us from uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They even openly spread fallacies such as "during labor, one cannot bend the waist, cannot use strength, otherwise the waist will become thick, and the hands will become ugly" to intimidate students. The purpose of these reactionaries is to resist Chairman Mao's educational and cultural lines, attempting to lead us into the pit of despising labor and alienating from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to cultivate us into successors of the bourgeoisie.

The sea surges and waves roll. Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, led the revolutionary cultural warriors to brave the storm and waves, breaking through the mist and haze of the old cultural world, capturing one after another strongholds of the bourgeoisie, successfully creating eight model revolutionary operas that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. On the stage, we drove away the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties; in the schools, we also seized back the right to go deep into life and unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers from the hands of a handful of capitalist roaders.

Through the rehearsal and performance of "White-Haired Girl," we deeply felt: to perform revolutionary plays, one must first become a revolutionary; to perform poor and lower-middle peasants, one must first learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers, receiving re-education from them, and thoroughly changing old ideas is the greatest fundamental skill for revolutionary cultural warriors.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we once visited some poor and lower-middle peasants in Yibin, Sichuan, who had similar tragic experiences as "White-Haired Girl" in the old society, which educated us greatly. This May, we also went to the suburbs of Shanghai, Baoshan County, Hengsha Island to experience life. In the process of eating, living, working, studying, and criticizing together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, we were most deeply educated by: the broad poor and lower-middle peasants have unlimited love for Chairman Mao and unlimited love for Mao Zedong Thought. The homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants are all covered with portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao. They report to and consult with Chairman Mao every day. They work hard from dawn to dusk and still study Chairman Mao's works every second at night. The class consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants is high, and they have clear distinctions between love and hate. A poor peasant repeatedly excitedly told us: "In the old society, I lived in a cave, covered with wild flowers, dressed poorly, and ate poorly. After liberation, I stood up. I will never forget the Communist Party when I stand up, and I will never forget Chairman Mao when I am happy. China's Khrushchev wants to restore capitalism, making us poor and lower-middle peasants suffer again. We will never agree to this, not even a thousand times, not even ten thousand times." Vice Chairman Lin taught us: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." Through the class education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we have a deeper understanding of Vice Chairman Lin's words. An actress who plays "White-Haired Girl" said: "In the past, when I performed, I acted for the sake of acting, performed for the sake of performing. After going deep into life, I think of myself on the stage not as myself, but as 'White-Haired Girl,' the representative of poor peasants, who must persist in living in the mountains and fight against class enemies." Because of the improvement in ideological understanding, now she performs with genuine emotions and strong, powerful movements.

Workers, peasants, and soldiers are our best teachers. In our troupe, there is an incident that deeply educates us. An actor who plays Dashun in "White-Haired Girl" comes from a poor peasant family. In the past, when the capitalist roaders ruled the school, he once performed the prince in "Swan Lake." His mother was very angry after watching the performance, thinking that performing these things was useless and had nothing to see. Later, this poor peasant mother knew that her son was performing Dashun in "White-Haired Girl," and she happily watched the performance, thinking that such a dance could greatly boost the morale of the poor and lower-middle peasants and encouraged him to better perform for the poor and lower-middle peasants. This incident had a great impact on us. The clear distinction between love and hate of this poor peasant mother deeply educated us: revolutionary art must reflect the struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers and must sing the praises of the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

As a revolutionary cultural warrior, to better propagate Mao Zedong Thought on the cultural stage and better create the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, one must master the fundamental skills in art. However, uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers is the first fundamental skill for us revolutionary cultural warriors. Only by mastering this first fundamental skill can we change our worldview, master the fundamental skills in art, and better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers.

An era of the proletariat leading the struggle to criticize and transform the superstructure has arrived. Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao has sent us relatives—the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of workers. The industrial workers' army marches into the cultural world to lead the struggle to criticize and transform, which is a great event of the 1960s. We are determined, under the leadership of the proletariat, in the process of going deep into workers, peasants, and soldiers, to master the fundamental skill of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers; to be a student of workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, consciously receiving re-education, thoroughly changing old ideas, and striving to create more, taller, and more perfect heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the ballet stage!

    同工农兵结合是第一基本功
    上海舞蹈学校芭蕾舞《白毛女》剧组
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的这一英明指示，为广大革命的知识分子和文艺战士指明了唯一正确的道路和无限广阔的前途。我们这些年轻的文艺战士，对旧学校的修正主义教育制度的毒害，有着切身的体会。回顾旧学校的生活和芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》创作、演出的过程，我们更加深刻地体会到毛主席最新指示的无比正确伟大。
    在资产阶级统治下的旧舞蹈学校，党内一小撮走资派秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，推行了反革命修正主义的教育路线和文艺路线，大肆宣扬舞蹈演员的“特殊”论，以“每个学期，期初要复课不能下去；期中是长功的时候，不能下去；期末要考试，不能下去”为借口，千方百计地阻止我们和工农兵相结合。他们甚至还公然散布什么“劳动时腰不能弯，手不能用劲，否则腰会粗，手会难看”等等谬论，来恐吓学生。这些反动家伙这样做的目的就是为了对抗毛主席的教育路线和文艺路线，妄图把我们引向轻视劳动，脱离工农兵的泥坑，把我们培养成为资产阶级的接班人。
    倒海翻江卷巨澜。我们敬爱的江青同志，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，率领广大革命文艺战士顶狂风，战恶浪，冲破了旧文艺界的妖氛迷雾，攻克了资产阶级一个又一个的艺术堡垒，成功地创作出了八个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命样板戏。在舞台上，我们赶跑了那些帝王将相、才子佳人；在学校里，我们也从一小撮走资派手中夺回了深入生活、与工农兵相结合的权利。
    通过《白毛女》排练和演出的实践，我们深深体会到：要演革命戏，一定要先做革命人；要演贫下中农，一定要先向贫下中农学习。和工农兵相结合，接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，是革命文艺战士最大最大的基本功。
    我们遵循毛主席的教导，曾到四川宜宾地区访问过一些在旧社会类似“白毛女”悲惨遭遇的贫下中农，使我们受到了很大的教育。今年五月，我们又到上海郊区宝山县横沙岛深入生活。在我们和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同批判的过程中，受教育最深的就是：广大贫下中农无限热爱毛主席、无限热爱毛泽东思想。贫下中农家里都贴满了我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像。他们每天向毛主席请示和汇报。他们早出晚归辛勤劳动，晚上还分秒必争地学习毛主席著作。贫下中农的阶级觉悟高，爱憎分明。一位贫农社员多次激动地对我们说：“我在解放前住的是滚地龙，盖的是被花精，穿不暖吃不饱。解放后翻身了。翻身不忘共产党，幸福不忘毛主席。中国赫鲁晓夫要复辟资本主义，叫我们贫下中农再吃二遍苦，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。”林副主席教导我们：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”通过贫下中农对我们的阶级教育，我们对林副主席的这句话有了更深刻的领会。扮演“白毛女”的一个演员同志说：“过去我在演出时，为做戏而做戏，为表演而表演。深入生活以后，我在舞台上想到的不是我自己，而是作为贫农代表的‘白毛女’，一定要在深山坚持活下去，要对阶级敌人进行斗争。”由于思想认识提高了，现在她在演出时，感情就真实了，动作也坚强有力了。
    工农兵是我们最好的老师。在我们剧组里，有这样一件事情，深深地教育着我们。在《白毛女》中扮演大春的一位出身贫农家庭的演员，过去在走资派统治学校的时候，曾经演过《天鹅湖》中的王子，他的母亲看了演出后十分生气，认为他演这些东西没有出息，没有什么看头。后来，这位贫农妈妈知道儿子在演出《白毛女》中的大春，她高兴地观看了演出，认为这样的舞蹈能够大长贫下中农的志气，鼓励他更好地为贫下中农演戏。这件事对我们震动很大。这位贫农妈妈爱憎分明的态度，深刻地教育了我们：革命的文艺，一定要反映工农兵的斗争生活，一定要歌颂工农兵的英雄形象。
    作为一个革命的文艺战士，要想在文艺舞台上更好地宣传毛泽东思想，更好地塑造工农兵英雄形象，一定要练好艺术上的基本功。但是，同工农兵结合，是我们革命文艺战士的第一基本功。只有把这个第一基本功练好，我们才能改造世界观，才能掌握好艺术上的基本功，才能更好地为工农兵服务。
    一个工人阶级领导上层建筑斗、批、改的伟大时代已经到来了。最近，伟大领袖毛主席又为我们派来了亲人——工人毛泽东思想宣传队。产业工人大军开进文艺界领导斗、批、改，这是二十世纪六十年代的伟大事件。我们决心在工人阶级的领导下，在深入工农兵的过程中，练好和工农兵相结合的基本功；一辈子拜工农兵为师，自觉地接受再教育，彻底改变旧思想，为在芭蕾舞台上塑造出更多、更高大、更完美的工农兵英雄形象而努力奋斗！
