Tangdong Primary School was established at the end of 1964 by the poor and lower-middle peasants themselves as a school for farming and studying. The poor and lower-middle peasants appointed me as a teacher. At first, I thought: I only attended one month of junior high school after completing my primary education, and I have been engaged in production for seven years, so my knowledge is quite rusty. How can I be a teacher? If I become a teacher, who will take care of my three-month-old child? Who will do the housework? The production team mobilized me both horizontally and vertically, but I refused to agree. Later, the poor and lower-middle peasants said to me, "Minghua, before liberation, we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered greatly at the hands of the landlords and were bullied by them. The landlords cursed us for three generations of not reading books, as if we were a 'pigsty.' You should fight for our poor and lower-middle peasants!" The words of the poor and lower-middle peasants stirred my memories: In the old society, my family could barely make ends meet, and we struggled to get through the month. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could I have the opportunity to study for a few years? I am a daughter of a poor peasant, and I must remember the class bitterness and blood debt. The poor and lower-middle peasants also educated me, saying, "We are asking you to take on this responsibility, not just to teach children a few characters, but to help us poor and lower-middle peasants grasp the power of literacy." With the help of everyone, I overcame my selfishness, dispelled my worries, and made up my mind to take on the responsibility for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the school, the question of "for whom the door is open" was thoroughly debated and resolved.

After the school was established, out of more than sixty school-age children in the entire brigade, only about twenty came to school. Those who came were often absent for three days and present for two. Why was this the case? I opened the Little Red Book and sought guidance from Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao taught us, "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, we cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." I decided to visit the homes of the students and seek advice from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

One day, I visited the home of Zhou Jianying, a poor peasant student who often skipped classes. Jianying's mother said, "Chairman Mao established schools for us, and which child doesn't want to study! It's just that Jianying's younger sister has no one to take care of her. If Jianying goes to school, the adults won't be able to work." Chairman Mao taught us, "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other." The poor and lower-middle peasants and I are like fruits on the same vine; their difficulties are my difficulties. The next morning, I went to her house, took Jianying, and carried her younger sister to school. Afterwards, I allowed students to bring their younger siblings to school, and thus the number of students increased compared to before.

However, there was still a portion of school-age children who could not come to class. Why was this? On a rainy day, I visited the home of Chen Caiqiu, a daughter of a poor peasant. Her mother said to me, "I am a women's representative and cannot read or write. I cannot take notes during meetings or ask others about applying pesticides. Scientific farming requires literacy. I really want Caiqiu to go to school, but the school has fixed class times, and someone needs to do the housework." Caiqiu's mother's words were a criticism of the old educational system. I told her, "Let Caiqiu come to school. Whenever she comes, I will teach her." Soon, Chen Caiqiu happily came to school.

I visited each home, listened to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and they said, "Recruitment is only once a year, and if you miss it by a few months, you can't enter the school." "Our children are older, and the school years are so long. What age will they be when they graduate?" "The school is on vacation during the busy farming season and not during the slack season." The words of the poor and lower-middle peasants hit the nail on the head of the revisionist educational line and deeply educated me. Thus, I followed Chairman Mao's teachings and, based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly debated and resolved the question of "for whom the door is open" in the school: Students' ages are not restricted; they can enroll at any time; they can skip grades; they can study full-time, half-time, or even come in the evening; if a student is absent, I will go to their home to make up the lessons. The winter and summer vacations were abolished and replaced with vacations during the busy farming season and the Spring Festival, flexibly arranging class times so that more can be learned during the slack season, less during the minor busy season, and participating in labor during the major busy season. The six-year curriculum was changed to five years. With these changes, the poor and lower-middle peasants sent all their children to school, saying, "This way of running a school suits us. Thank Chairman Mao, thank the Communist Party."

Based on the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants, cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause.

Not long after the school opened, some students were very naughty, fighting and making noise, and not following classroom discipline. I called out to them, but they paid no attention; I tried to persuade them, but they paid no heed. What should I do? I went to seek advice from the poor and lower-middle peasants, asking them to help me find the cause and think of solutions. The poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out bluntly, "These children have not experienced the hardships of the old society and do not know that studying now is a blessing. If the students' discipline is poor, they need class education." The poor and lower-middle peasants' opinion was so good! I invited old poor peasants to the school to give classes on remembering bitterness and comparing the past with the present, or I took the students to the production team to listen to reports on remembering bitterness and thinking sweetly. I also studied the "Three Articles" with the students. The students understood the reason for studying for the revolution, and their organizational discipline improved.

I was educated in an old school and had been poisoned by some bourgeois education. The teaching content and methods were basically the old ones. The poor and lower-middle peasants educated me, saying, "Minghua, Chairman Mao wants you to cultivate socialist-conscious, cultured laborers for us. But the children you teach cannot read Chairman Mao's books, cannot do accounting, what use are they?" The words of the poor and lower-middle peasants educated me. I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and reformed the old teaching content and methods. I opened classes on Chairman Mao's quotations, making class education the main course. Cultural classes emphasized proletarian politics, with the first grade learning common rural characters, the second grade learning abacus, and the third grade learning how to record work points and accounts. There were no textbooks, so we compiled our own. To strengthen the students' ideological revolutionization, I organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the students, and together we "struggled against selfishness and criticized revisionism," carrying out the "Three Loyalty" activities. I also led the students to the three great revolutionary movements, experiencing wind and rain, seeing the world, and being tempered. I invited old poor peasants to the school to teach classes on class education, production labor, accounting, and military training. I broke the old rules of "teacher's authority" and encouraged students to go on stage, implementing "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers." The poor and lower-middle peasants all said, "Good! This is a good change!"

With the poor and lower-middle peasants supporting me, I am fearless in the face of all difficulties and hardships.

Educational revolution is a profound revolution, a great struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and the revisionist educational line. I listened to Chairman Mao's words, rebelled against the revisionist educational line, and thus faced the fierce opposition of the class enemies. They spread all kinds of rumors, saying, "A school next to a pigsty cannot teach out a qilin or hatch a phoenix."

In May 1966, according to the wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, I made the study of Chairman Mao's quotations the main course. The capitalist roaders and class enemies in society were terrified and enraged, using every means to sabotage it. Facing the rampant attacks of the class enemies, the poor and lower-middle peasants encouraged me, saying, "Chairman Mao is our great savior. If we don't study Chairman Mao's books, what books should we study!" With the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants, I was fearless. In the latter half of last year, at the critical moment of the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the class enemies used even more despicable tricks. They, under the pretext of investigation, gathered a lot of material against me, spreading all kinds of rumors, calling me an "iron-clad old conservative," a "two-faced person," and saying that our school's educational revolution was "reforming" and "repairing," causing a great stir. At this critical moment of severe test, I opened the red Little Red Book, and Chairman Mao taught us, "This army has the spirit of marching forward without fear of sacrifice, it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy." The poor and lower-middle peasants also encouraged me, saying, "Don't be afraid, this is a fierce struggle between the two classes, you must bravely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Chairman Mao's teachings and the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants made me stand tall and firm in my belief in educating for the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the educational revolution, when there were ideological problems, the poor and lower-middle peasants helped me; when there were difficulties, the poor and lower-middle peasants supported me; when I made mistakes in my work, the poor and lower-middle peasants criticized me; when I did well, the poor and lower-middle peasants encouraged me.

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the direct leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants, our school's students have grown rapidly in the three great revolutionary movements, and their spiritual faces have undergone profound changes. The poor peasant student Wang Huilin, after school, actively participated in collective labor without recording work points. During the busy farming season, the students picked up wheat stalks and turned them in to the production team without asking for work points. They said, "The successors to the cause of communism should work for the revolution, not for work points."

Chairman Mao recently taught us, "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Combining the practice of the educational revolution, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are extremely wise and correct. Without Chairman Mao's guidance and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, nothing can be accomplished. I am determined to firmly follow Chairman Mao's words, firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and wholeheartedly do my best to educate them.

### 贫下中农信任我，我为贫下中农办好学

    贫下中农信任我，我为贫下中农办好学
    江苏省太仓县双凤公社塘东小学教师　周明华
    塘东小学是一九六四年底贫下中农自己办的一所耕读小学。贫下中农让我当教师。开始我想：我高小毕业后才读了一个月的初中，参加了七年生产劳动，书本荒了许多，怎么能当教师？当了教师，我那刚三个月的孩子啥人领？家务事啥人做？生产队横动员、竖动员，我就是不答应。后来，贫下中农对我说：“明华，解放前我们贫下中农吃尽了地主的苦，受尽了地主的欺，地主骂我们三代不念书，好似‘一窝猪’。你要替我们贫下中农争口气！”贫下中农的话勾起了我的回忆：在旧社会，家里吃了上顿没下顿，过了初一难度月半，要不是共产党、毛主席，我怎能有今天，怎能读几年书？我是贫农的女儿，要牢记阶级苦，血泪仇。贫下中农还教育我说：“我们叫你挑担子，不光是为了教囡识几个字，是为我们贫下中农掌文权。”在大家的帮助下，我战胜了“私”字，解除了顾虑，下定决心，为贫下中农挑担子。
    在学校为谁开门的问题上大破大立
    学校办起后，全大队六十多个学龄儿童只来了二十几个。到校的也是三天打鱼，两天晒网。究竟为啥？我打开红宝书，请教毛主席。毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我决心上门访问，向贫下中农请教。
    有一天，我到常常缺课的贫农学生周建英家里，周建英的娘说：“毛主席为我们办学堂，那家囡不想读书！就是建英的妹妹没人管，建英要上了学，大人就出不了工。”毛主席教导我们：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”我和贫下中农是一根藤上的瓜，贫下中农的困难就是我的困难。第二天一早，我就到她家，领了建英，抱了她的妹妹来到学校。以后，我就允许学生带弟弟、妹妹上学，这样学生就比以前多了。
    但是，还有一部分学龄儿童不能来上课，这是为什么呢？在一个雨天里，我访问了贫农女儿陈彩球的家，她娘对我说：“我当妇女代表，不识字，听报告不会记录，打农药要问别人。科学种田，不识字不行。我很想让彩球上学，可是学校上课有固定时间，家务事没人做也不行啊！”彩球娘的话，是对旧教育制度的控诉。我对她说：“让彩球上学吧，她啥时来，我啥时教”。不久，陈彩球高高兴兴地来上学了。
    我一家家访问，一户户听取贫下中农的意见，他们说：“招生一年一趟，差几个月就进不了学堂。”“我们囡年纪大，上学年头这样长，毕业出来啥年纪了？”“学堂放假，农忙的时候不放，放假的时候农活不忙。”贫下中农的话，击中了修正主义教育路线的要害，也深深地教育了我。于是，我遵照毛主席的教导，根据贫下中农的意见，在学校“为谁开门”的问题上大破大立：学生读书不限年龄；允许随时插班；允许跳级；可以全日读，半日读，也可以晚上来上课；学生缺课，就上门补。取消寒暑假，改放农忙假和春节假，灵活安排上课时间，农闲多学，小忙少学，大忙参加劳动。学制六年改为五年。这样一改，贫下中农把囡都送来了，他们说：“这样办学，我们称心。感谢毛主席，感谢共产党。”
    根据贫下中农的需要培养革命事业接班人
    开学不久，有一部分学生很调皮，打打闹闹，上课不守纪律。我喊他们不理；我劝他们不听，怎么办？我就去找贫下中农，请他们帮我找原因，想办法。贫下中农一针见血地指出：“这些囡不曾吃过旧社会的苦，也不晓得现在读书是幸福。学生纪律不好，要进行阶级教育。”贫下中农的意见多好啊！我便请老贫农到学校对学生进行回忆对比的教育；或者把学生带到生产队，听忆苦思甜报告。我又和学生一起学习“老三篇”。学生明白了为革命读书的道理，组织纪律性提高了。
    我是从旧学校培养出来的学生，中了资产阶级教育的一些毒。教学内容和教学方法基本上是旧的一套。贫下中农教育我说：“明华，毛主席要你为我们培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。可你教出来的囡，不会读毛主席的书，不会打算盘记账，有啥用处？”贫下中农的话教育了我，我反复学习了毛主席的“五·七”指示，对旧教学内容和教学方法作了改革。开设了毛主席语录课，把阶级教育作为主课。文化课突出无产阶级政治，一年级学农村常用字，二年级学珠算，三年级学记工分、记账。没有课本自己编。为了加强学生的思想革命化，我和学生一起大办毛泽东思想学习班，和学生一块“斗私，批修”，开展“三忠于”活动。我还带领学生到三大革命运动中，经风雨，见世面，受锻炼。把老贫农请到学校讲阶级教育课、生产劳动课、会计珠算课、军体课。大破“师道尊严”的旧规，培养学生上讲台，实行“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”。贫下中农都说：好！改得好！
    有贫下中农撑腰千难万险不动摇
    教育革命是一场深刻的大革命，是毛主席的无产阶级教育路线同修正主义教育路线的一场大搏斗。我听了毛主席的话，造了修正主义教育路线的反，这就遭到了阶级敌人的疯狂反对。他们散布各种流言蜚语，胡说什么“猪棚隔壁办学堂，教不出麒麟，孵不出凤凰。”
    一九六六年五月，我按照贫下中农的愿望，把学习毛主席语录列为主要课程。走资派及社会上的阶级敌人怕得要死，恨得要命，千方百计进行破坏。面对阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，贫下中农鼓励我说：“毛主席是我们的大救星，不读毛主席的书，读啥书！”有贫下中农支持，我什么都不怕。去年下半年正当两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈决战的关头，阶级敌人使出了更加卑鄙的伎俩，他们以调查为名，整了我一大堆材料，给我造了种种谣言，什么“铁杆老保”、“两面派”，还说我们学校的教育革命是“改良”，是“修补”，闹得满城风雨。在这严峻考验的关键时刻，我打开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，毛主席教导我们：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”贫下中农也鼓励我说，不要怕，这是两个阶级的激烈搏斗，你要勇敢地捍卫毛主席的革命路线。毛主席的教导，贫下中农的支持，使我挺起了腰杆，坚定了为贫下中农办学的信心。在教育革命中，有了思想问题，贫下中农帮助我；有了困难，贫下中农支持我；工作做错了，贫下中农批评我；做对了，贫下中农鼓励我。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下，在贫下中农直接领导下，我校学生在三大革命运动中迅速成长，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。贫农学生王会林，放学后就积极参加集体劳动，不记工分。农忙假中，学生拾麦穗，交到生产队，也不要工分。他们说：“共产主义事业接班人要为革命出力，决不是为工分干活。”
    毛主席最近教导我们：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”结合教育革命的实践，我深深体会到：毛主席的最新指示无比英明，无比正确。离开了毛主席的教导，离开了广大贫下中农，就一事无成。我决心坚决听毛主席的话，坚决依靠贫下中农，全心全意为贫下中农办好学。
