The revolutionary committee of Miluo Commune in Miluo County, Hunan Province, has been resolutely implementing the policy of sending cadres on rotation to engage in labor, thereby significantly transforming the spiritual outlook of the cadres, strengthening their ties with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and effectively promoting the revolutionization of the commune's revolutionary committee. This has made the newly established revolutionary committee a battle command center that emphasizes proletarian politics, is full of revolutionary spirit, acts decisively, and is efficient and powerful.

When the commune's revolutionary committee was first established, it had discussed the issue of cadres going to the front lines to participate in production labor. However, at that time, some comrades had insufficient understanding of the great significance of cadres participating in production labor and harbored various misgivings. Some thought that the commune was large, with few people and many tasks, and that if cadres were sent down to labor, there would be no one to handle daily affairs. Others thought that the revolutionary committee cadres were all of peasant origin, and that each of them knew how to plow and wield a hoe. Therefore, the issue of cadres participating in production labor was not resolved. In April of this year, the cadres of the commune's revolutionary committee returned from studying the experience of Dazhai and launched the "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture" movement throughout the commune. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "We learn from Dazhai, and you should learn from Chen Yonggui!" These words drew the high attention of the commune's revolutionary committee members, who immediately organized the revolutionary committee cadres to restudy Chairman Mao's great teachings on "the necessity of maintaining the system of cadres participating in collective production labor." After raising everyone's awareness of the importance of participating in collective production labor through study, the commune's revolutionary committee made the decision to send cadres down to labor in batches: the 15 cadres of the commune's revolutionary committee (including 8 committee members and 7 clerks) would send 3 to 5 people down each time, with each labor period lasting about 10 days, ensuring a continuous flow without interruption. The cadres sent down were required to live with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the production brigades, eating, living, working, studying, and fighting together with them. They were to be ordinary laborers as well as propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. Through labor, they would better learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, carry forward the Party's three great styles of work, maintain close ties with the masses, and accelerate their own ideological revolution. From May to the end of September, the cadres of the commune's revolutionary committee had taken turns to go down to labor 2 to 3 times, with each person working an average of 32 days in the production brigades, and the most diligent having worked 46 days.

Cadres going down to participate in labor has greatly strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, making the masses more willing to speak out and express their opinions, helping cadres to timely discover and correct mistakes and shortcomings in their work. The commune's newly built mechanized road had a section passing through the first production brigade of the Pinghe Production Brigade. According to the original survey plan, the road would occupy 8 mu of good land and require over 300 man-days of labor. The task had already been assigned to the brigade, awaiting commencement. At this time, the poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their differing opinions and proposed an alternative route to the deputy director of the commune's revolutionary committee who was sent down to labor. After changing the route, not only was good land not occupied, but also over 200 man-days of labor were saved. This deputy director of the revolutionary committee deeply felt, "Working together with the poor and lower-middle peasants is good. In the past, opinions that we couldn't hear were heard, and problems that we couldn't solve were solved." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Now the cadres have Chairman Mao's instructions engraved in their minds and have the poor and lower-middle peasants in their hearts. The seal of the proletariat, we will definitely hold it firmly."

Cadres going down to participate in labor has greatly enhanced the cadres' sense of serving the people, going wherever there are difficulties and problems to solve them. The homes of community members and the fields have become their offices. In the past, the commune distributed agricultural supplies with cumbersome procedures, and just for issuing receipts, the entire commune would spend over 30 man-days each month, which caused a lot of complaints from the masses. Now, the revolutionary committee cadres deliver the supplies to the doorsteps of the community members, which has been well received by the community members.

The cadres of the commune's revolutionary committee going down to labor have placed themselves among the masses, becoming more perceptive and better able to lead the masses in launching more vigorous attacks on class enemies. The sixth production brigade of the Pinghe Production Brigade in this commune had reduced production last year, and its accumulation had decreased, with other work also being relatively passive. What was the real reason? A cadre of the revolutionary committee who had previously worked there always thought it was because the brigade leader was incompetent. In late June of this year, he went down to this brigade to labor with the community members and found out the real reason why this production brigade was backward: it was because an unrepentant landlord element was secretly sabotaging the efforts. Once the root of the problem was identified, the cadres of the commune's revolutionary committee mobilized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade to expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of this landlord element, suppressing the enemy's arrogance and bringing about significant changes in the brigade's revolutionary production.

Great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out, "A large number of cadres going down to labor is a very good opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly encouraged and spurred on the comrades of the Miluo Commune Revolutionary Committee. They firmly declared: We will listen to Chairman Mao's words, forever keep Chairman Mao's instructions in our hearts, persist in the correct direction of "cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches," consolidate and develop the achievements we have made, forever take root among the masses, and ensure that the newly established proletarian revolutionary power remains ever-vigorous, and that all cadres forever maintain their revolutionary youthfulness.

    坚决贯彻毛主席的指示加速实现干部思想革命化
    汨罗公社在职干部分批下放劳动
    据新华社长沙二十五日电　湖南省汨罗县汨罗公社革命委员会，坚持实行在职干部分批下放劳动的制度，大大改变了干部的精神面貌，密切了同广大贫下中农的联系，有力地推动了革委会机关革命化，使新生的革命委员会成为突出无产阶级政治，充满革命干劲，雷厉风行，精悍有力的战斗指挥部。
    公社革命委员会刚成立时，曾经研究过革委会干部深入第一线参加生产劳动的问题。由于当时部分同志对干部参加生产劳动的伟大意义认识不足，存在着各种活思想。有的认为，公社大，人少事多，干部再下放劳动，日常事务就没有人处理；有的认为，革委会干部都是劳动人民出身，那一个不会扶犁掌耙？因此，干部参加生产劳动问题未得解决。今年四月，公社革委会干部从大寨取经回来，在全公社开展了“农业学大寨”运动。贫下中农说：“我们学大寨，你们也要学陈永贵啊！”这句话，引起了公社革委会同志的高度重视，当即组织革委会的干部，重新学习了毛主席关于“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度”的伟大教导。通过学习提高了大家对参加集体生产劳动重要性的认识以后，公社革委会作出干部分批下放劳动的决定：公社革委会十五个干部（其中八个革委会委员、七个办事员），每次下放三至五人，每次劳动十天左右，做到长流水，不断线。要求下去的干部住到生产队贫下中农家里，与他们同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗，既是普通的劳动者，又是毛泽东思想的宣传员。在劳动中，更好地向贫下中农学习，发扬党的三大作风，密切联系群众，加速自己的思想革命化。从五月到九月底，公社革委会的干部，已轮流下放劳动二至三次，平均每人在生产队劳动三十二天，最多的已劳动四十六天。
    干部下放参加劳动，大大密切了干部和群众的关系，群众有话肯讲，有意见敢提，帮助干部及时发现和纠正了工作中的缺点和错误。公社新修机耕大道，有一段路经过和平大队第一生产队，按原测定计划修建，需要占用良田八分，花工三百多个。任务已经分配到队，只待动工。这时，贫下中农向下放劳动的公社革委会副主任提出了不同意见和改道方案。经过改道，不仅没有占用良田，还省工二百多个。这个革委会副主任深有体会地说：“同贫下中农一起劳动就是好，过去听不到的意见听到了，解决不了的问题解决了。”广大贫下中农说：“现在的干部，把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，把我们贫下中农放在心坎上，无产阶级的大印，我们一定掌得牢。”
    干部下放参加劳动，大大增强了干部为人民服务的观念，那里有困难、有问题，他们就到那里去解决。社员家里、田边都成为他们办公的地方。过去公社发放农用物资，手续烦琐，仅领条据，每个月全社就得花三十多个工，群众意见很大。现在改由革委会干部送上门去，受到社员的好评。
    公社革委会的干部下放劳动，置身于群众之中，耳聪目明，更好地率领群众向阶级敌人发起了更加猛烈的进攻。这个公社和平大队第六生产队，去年减了产，积累有所减少，其他工作也比较被动。到底是什么原因呢？过去在这里工作的一个革委会干部，总认为是生产队长领导不力。今年六月底，他下放到这个队跟社员一起劳动，了解到这个生产队后进的真实原因，是一个没有改造好的地主分子在暗中破坏。祸根找到了，公社革委会干部便发动这个队的广大贫下中农，揭露了这个地主分子的反革命罪行，把敌人的嚣张气焰打下去，使队里的革命生产发生很大变化。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”毛主席的最新指示给汨罗公社革委会的同志极大的鼓舞，极大的鞭策。他们坚定地表示：听毛主席的话，永远把毛主席的指示铭记在心里，坚持“在职干部也应分批下放劳动”的正确方向，巩固和发展已取得的成绩，永远扎根在群众之中，使新生的无产阶级革命政权，永远保持鲜红的颜色，使全体干部永葆无产阶级的革命青春。
