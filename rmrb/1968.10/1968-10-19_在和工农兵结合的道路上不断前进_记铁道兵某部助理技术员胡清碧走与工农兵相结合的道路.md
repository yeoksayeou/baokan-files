Edition: 4

Assistant Engineer Hu Qingbi of a certain unit of the Railway Corps has, in the three years since joining the army, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought that is the People's Liberation Army. He has resolutely taken the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as pointed out by Chairman Mao, and the path of integrating theory with practice. He has earnestly transformed his worldview. In the process of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, he has achieved remarkable results and has been praised by the broad masses of cadres and soldiers.

Integrating with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers to Thoroughly Transform One's Worldview

Hu Qingbi was assigned to the Railway Corps after graduating from the Railway Engineering School in 1965. When she happily donned her new military uniform and wore the shining red five-star cap insignia and red armband, her heart was filled with excitement. Even while she was a student, she had long yearned for the life of a soldier in the People's Liberation Army. Today, her dream had finally come true.

However, when the leadership assigned her and her fellow interns to the platoons for training, to study and work alongside the soldiers, her mood fluctuated. On the first day of participating in labor, she entered the tunnel and walked on the high walkway. Looking down, she dared not take a step. Once, while waiting for the blast, she sat alone in a corner, lost in thought. But the soldiers were using the interval to study Chairman Mao's works. After the blast, when the soldiers rushed to pry loose the dangerous rocks, she saw those jagged rocks and dared not even approach. She anxiously asked an old soldier, "Aren't you afraid of a cave-in?" The old soldier replied, "What's there to be afraid of in a cave-in? What's scary is a 'cave-in' in your thoughts. As long as your thoughts don't 'cave in,' you can face anything, even mountains of knives and seas of fire. But if your thoughts 'cave in,' even a small stone can crush you." Hearing the soldier's words, her face burned with shame. That night, when she returned to her quarters, Hu Qingbi studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, that is where we need to go to solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties." Comparing herself to Chairman Mao's words, she engaged in a fierce struggle in her mind: Should she listen to Chairman Mao's words and become a revolutionary soldier who dares to struggle against difficulties, or should she hesitate and waver, becoming a disgraceful deserter?

Soon, the glorious deeds of Comrade Wang Jie were published in the newspapers, and the army launched a campaign to learn from Wang Jie. Hu Qingbi, with a heart full of respect, read "Wang Jie's Diary" over and over, becoming more and more excited. She repeatedly pondered: Why is there such a big difference between me and Comrade Wang Jie, both of us growing up under the red flag? The fundamental difference is that I have not studied and applied Chairman Mao's works as diligently as Comrade Wang Jie. Comrade Wang Jie read Chairman Mao's books, learned from them, and put them into practice. But I read Chairman Mao's books without connecting them to my own thoughts; I studied but did not act. From then on, she made up her mind to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect. She used Mao Zedong Thought as a golden key to open the door to ideological transformation, thoroughly transforming her worldview, and truly integrating with the soldiers politically, ideologically, and emotionally.

What is recognized in thought is not necessarily achieved in action. To shorten the distance between "saying" and "doing," one must make arduous efforts. Once, Hu Qingbi, finding it too hot, did not wear her work clothes but only a white shirt into the tunnel. In the adit, the person operating the wind gun closed the door and advised her, "You'd better go out; otherwise, oil and rock melt will splatter all over you, and your white shirt will be ruined!" Suddenly, she realized: Although she was standing among the soldiers, she felt as if there was a mountain between them. Why did the soldiers treat her as a guest? It was because, although she wore a military uniform, she lacked the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Wearing a white shirt into the tunnel was only a superficial problem; the root cause was the lack of determination to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. She reflected on this problem, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing and able to integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Mao Zedong Thought illuminated her heart. She decided to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, taking on the most difficult tasks and going to the most dangerous places. Once, during an electric blasting operation, a malfunction occurred, and none of the charges in the adit detonated. To troubleshoot, she had to go inside to check. Hu Qingbi knew this was very dangerous. What should she do? At this moment, the words "We die for the people, and it is a worthy death" flashed before her eyes. She immediately disconnected the mother line from the detonator, cut the circuit, briefly instructed the blasting team, and rushed into the tunnel with a flashlight. Later, two comrades from the blasting team caught up, and they worked together to check. When they found a problem with a connection, suddenly the power room opened the switch, and the electrified tracks, wind pipes, and other conductive objects in the tunnel could cause the detonators to explode at any moment. In that critical instant, Hu Qingbi stepped forward and pulled the connection apart, cutting the circuit and preventing a potential serious accident. In actual struggles, Hu Qingbi increasingly felt that the process of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers is the process of transforming one's worldview. One must consciously revolutionize, bravely face difficulties, and dare to fight against the "selfish" nature of the bourgeoisie to take the first step on the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao.

Integrating with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers to Eliminate the Poison of the Revisionist Educational Line

When Hu Qingbi first arrived at the construction unit, she thought that after studying for more than ten years and majoring in track engineering, this was a good opportunity to show her skills. Her first task was to place the stakes of a pit according to the drawings. This was the most basic technical work, and she started working after looking at the drawings. Unexpectedly, when it came to actually transferring the drawings to the ground, she became flustered, and the stakes could not be placed correctly. Later, although the stakes were placed, their positions were wrong, and it was only with the help of the soldiers that the mistake was corrected. At that time, although she felt bad, she had not yet raised her awareness to the level of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, and she realized that her inability to "fight on paper" and the disconnect between theory and practice were entirely the result of the evil consequences of the revisionist educational line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. This made her even more deeply hate the Chinese Khrushchev. Despite the busy work, she actively participated in the revolutionary criticism and struggle, launching fierce attacks on the Chinese Khrushchev.

In the second half of 1966, the leadership assigned Hu Qingbi to work on the millisecond electric blasting for tunnel excavation. This was a difficult new technology to master. The leadership inspired her to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "learning war from war" and encouraged her to learn, practice, and improve as she went along. Therefore, she actively participated in the daily readings with the blasting team, worked and operated with the soldiers, and held a democratic meeting after each blast to summarize experiences and lessons, humbly learning from the soldiers, and making progress with each blast.

From practice, they gradually discovered that with the change in rock quality, the angle, depth, and density of the blastholes must be adjusted in a timely and appropriate manner. However, she was not sure how to adjust them. At this time, she turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. "Why is there no confidence? Because he does not have a rule-based understanding of the content and environment of this work, or he has never been involved in this type of work, or he has been involved very little, and thus cannot talk about the rule-based nature of this type of work." She followed Chairman Mao's teachings and personally learned and participated in operating the wind gun. Some comrades, seeing her weak body and lack of strength, advised her, "You don't have to operate this wind gun that weighs dozens of pounds. The problems you want to understand, we will definitely explain to you in detail." But she thought, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger?" Without going to the front line, it is impossible to grasp the first-hand materials. Soon, she learned to operate the wind gun. Although her waist and legs ached and her ears rang after work, she felt very comfortable in her heart, and her relationship with the soldiers became even more harmonious. Through the collective efforts of the comrades, this new technology was finally mastered by them, and they consecutively created three advanced records.

Once, the leadership decided to have Hu Qingbi work with the comrades from the First Company's drug-making class to manufacture a type of explosive. The comrades from the drug-making class suggested, "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'be thrifty and revolutionary.' Can we change the 'proportion' and reduce the consumption of raw materials as much as possible?" Hu Qingbi, although she did not say no, still had doubts in her heart: Can the 'proportion' from the book be changed at will? However, the soldiers, regardless of the book or not, were eager to research and experiment. The soldiers' enthusiasm stirred up a struggle in Hu Qingbi's mind. She thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Humanity must constantly summarize experiences, discover, invent, create, and progress. The theory of stagnation, pessimism, inaction, and self-satisfaction is wrong." But why was she not daring to create? Why did she treat things like the 'Technical Specifications' in books as classics and dare not doubt them? Thinking and thinking, she felt that she had been deeply poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. It was the "regulations" and "frameworks" of bourgeois reactionary technological "authorities" that shackled her hands and feet. But the soldiers? They were fearless of heaven and earth, completely relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, so they dared to think, speak, act, and break all old rules and customs. The gap was found, and her mind was liberated. Hu Qingbi then actively participated in the experiments with everyone. After many repeated experiments, they finally found a new 'proportion' that could save raw materials and increase the explosive power. Everyone was very happy. Hu Qingbi was even happier than the comrades because she felt that not only had the 'proportion' for making explosives changed, but her spiritual outlook had also changed. In the days of being with the soldiers, she gradually came to understand a truth: "Many so-called intellectuals are actually the most ignorant, and sometimes the knowledge of workers and peasants is a bit more." "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience."

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution, "Universities should still be run. I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering. The system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command, following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice," were issued, Hu Qingbi, on the construction site, with a heart full of excitement, studied them over and over again. Chairman Mao's great teachings touched her heart. Hu Qingbi reviewed her growth process in the army and deeply felt that technical personnel of intellectual origin can only thoroughly transform their worldview and better serve the people by resolutely taking the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as pointed out by Chairman Mao, and the path of integrating theory with practice. She decided to always listen to the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely take the path indicated by Chairman Mao, never leave workers, peasants, and soldiers, and always be a student of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    在和工农兵结合的道路上不断前进
    ——记铁道兵某部助理技术员胡清碧走与工农兵相结合的道路
    铁道兵某部助理技术员胡清碧，入伍三年来，在人民解放军这所毛泽东思想大学校里，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决走毛主席指出的同工农兵相结合的道路，走理论和实践相结合的道路，认真改造世界观。在同工农兵结合的实践中取得了显著的成绩，受到广大干部、战士的赞扬。
    和工农兵结合彻底改造世界观
    胡清碧是一九六五年从铁路工程学校毕业后分配到铁道兵部队的。当她幸福地穿上崭新的军装，佩戴上红光闪闪的红五星帽徽和红领章的时候，她的心情非常激动。早在学校念书时，她就非常向往着解放军的战斗生活，今天，理想终于实现了。
    可是，当领导上把她们这批实习生分配下连队锻炼，和战士们同学习、同劳动的时候，她的情绪就发生了波动。参加劳动的第一天，她一进隧道，走在高高的步行板上，往下一看，连步都不敢迈。有一次，在等放炮的时候，她一个人悄悄坐在一边发愣。可是，战士们却抓紧间隙学习毛主席著作。放完炮，清理工作面时，战士们都抢着去撬危石，她一看到那些呲牙咧嘴的岩石，却连上都不敢上去。她担心地问一个老战士：“你们就不怕塌方？”老战士回答说；“塌方有什么可怕的！？怕的倒是思想上的‘塌方’。只要思想不‘塌方’，刀山火海都敢上；要是思想‘塌’了‘方’，一块小石头也能把你压垮。”听了战士的话，她脸上火辣辣的。晚上一回到住地，胡清碧就学习毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”对照毛主席的话，她思想上展开了激烈的斗争：是听毛主席的话，做一名勇于同困难作斗争的革命战士呢？还是犹豫、动摇，成为一名可耻的逃兵？
    不久，王杰同志的光辉事迹在报上登载了，部队里掀起了学习王杰的热潮。胡清碧怀着崇敬的心情，一遍又一遍地读着《王杰日记》，越读心情越激动。她反复思索：同样是在红旗下长大的革命青年，为什么我和王杰同志的差距这样大呢？千差万差，最根本的差距是没有象王杰同志那样活学活用毛主席著作。王杰同志读了毛主席的书，学了就用，说了就做。而自己读了毛主席的书，却没有和自己的思想挂钩，学是学，做是做。从此，她下定决心，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想这把金钥匙，来打开思想革命化的大门，彻底改造世界观，真正从政治上、思想上、感情上同战士结合在一起。
    思想上认识到了的，并不等于行动上都能做到。要缩短“说”和“做”之间的距离，还必须付出艰苦的努力。一次，胡清碧嫌热，没套工作服，只穿件白衬衣就进了洞。到了导坑里，打风枪的同志关了风门，劝她说：“你快出去吧，要不油呀、岩浆呀溅你一身，你这件白衣服就报销了！”顿时，她察觉到：她虽然就站在战士们中间，但和战士们却象隔了一座山似的。战士们为什么会把自己当成客人来看待呢？就是因为自己虽然穿上了军装，但是还缺少工农兵的思想感情。穿白衬衣进洞只是问题的现象，缺乏和工农兵结合的决心才是问题的本质。她针对这一问题，反复地学习毛主席的教导：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”毛泽东思想照亮了她的心。她决心按照毛主席的教导去做，越是困难的工作越是要上，越是危险的地方越是要去。有一次，电爆破作业发生故障，导坑里的炮全没有响。要排除故障，只有到里面去检查才行。胡清碧知道这是很危险的。怎么办？就在这时候，“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所”这一行金光闪闪的大字映现在她的眼前。于是，她马上从起爆机上解下母线，断好电路，向爆破班的同志们作了简要的交代，拿起手电筒就往洞里跑。后来爆破班两个战友赶上来了，便一齐动手检查。当查到一个接头有问题的时候，突然配电室把闸门开了，隧道里的钢轨、风管等导电体都传上了电，马上就可能引起雷管爆炸。就在这紧急的一瞬间，胡清碧上前一把扯断了接头，断了电路，避免了一场可能发生的严重事故。在实际斗争中，胡清碧越来越体会到：和工农兵相结合的过程，就是改造世界观的过程。必须自觉革命，迎着困难闯，敢和资产阶级的“私”字斗，才能按照毛主席指引的方向，在和工农兵相结合的道路上，迈开第一步。
    和工农兵结合，肃清修正主义教育路线的流毒
    胡清碧刚到施工部队的时候，满以为自己念了十几年书，学的又是线路专业，正是大显身手的好时机。她接受的第一个任务，是照着图纸放一个基坑的桩位。这是最起码的技术工作，她看了图纸就开始工作了。没想到一旦真的要把图纸上的东西搬到地面上去，就手忙脚乱起来，桩位怎么也放不好。后来，桩位虽然放了，但位置却错了，亏得战士们的帮助才纠正了过来。当时她心里虽然难受，但是还没有提高到两个阶级、两条路线斗争上去认识。无产阶级文化大革命开始了，她才觉悟到，自己之所以只能“纸上谈兵”，理论和实际脱节，这完全是中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义教育路线造成的恶果。这使她更加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，尽管工作紧张，她仍然积极投入到革命大批判的洪流，向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火。
    一九六六年下半年，领导上分配胡清碧搞隧道开挖的毫秒电爆破工作。这是很难掌握的新技术，领导上启发她学习毛主席关于“从战争学习战争”的教导，鼓励她边干边学边提高。于是，她每天都主动到爆破班参加天天读，和战士一起上工，一起操作，放一排炮开一次民主会，总结经验教训，虚心向战士学习，做到打一仗进一步。
    从实践中，他们逐渐摸索到，随着石质的变化，炮眼的角度、深度和密度必须及时进行适当的调整。但是，究竟怎么调整才好，她心里没有底。这时她就向毛主席著作请教。“为什么没有把握呢？因为他对于这项工作的内容和环境没有规律性的了解，或者他从来就没有接触过这类工作，或者接触得不多，因而无从谈到这类工作的规律性。”她遵照毛主席的教导，就亲自去学习和参加打风枪。有的同志看到她身体弱、力气小，劝她说：“这几十斤重的风枪，你就别打了，你要了解的问题，我们保证给你详细介绍。”但她想，“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”，不上第一线，根本不可能掌握第一手资料。很快她就学会了打风枪，虽然下班后腰酸腿疼，耳朵嗡嗡发响，但心里却很舒畅，她和战士们的关系也更融洽了。经过同志们的集体努力，这项新技术终于被他们掌握了，并且连续创造了三次先进纪录。
    一次领导上决定让胡清碧和一营制药班的同志一起制造一种炸药。制药班的同志们建议说：“毛主席教导我们‘要节约闹革命’，是不是可以改变一下‘配合比’，尽量减少原料的消耗？”胡清碧听了后，嘴里虽没说不行，但心里却在嘀咕：这“配合比”是从书本上抄来的，能随便改吗？但是，战士们却不管什么书本不书本的，一个劲的研究试验。战士们的干劲激起了胡清碧的思想斗争。她想起毛主席的教导：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。”可是自己为什么就不敢有所创造呢？为什么把《技术规范》这类书本上的东西奉为“经典”，不敢对它有所怀疑呢？想来想去，她感到自己中反革命修正主义教育路线的毒太深了，正是资产阶级反动技术“权威”的“条条”、“框框”束缚住了自己的手脚。而战士们呢？他们不怕天，不怕地，完全靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，所以他们就敢想、敢说、敢干、敢于破除一切陈规旧习。差距找到了，思想解放了，胡清碧便和大家一道积极搞实验。经过多次的反复试验，终于摸索出了一种既能节约原料，又能提高爆炸威力的新的“配合比”。大家都很高兴。胡清碧比同志们更高兴，因为她感到这不仅改变了造炸药的“配合比”，同时也改变了自己的精神面貌。在同战士相处的日子里，使她逐步地认识到这样一个真理：“就是许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点。”“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”
    伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”发表以后，胡清碧在工地上怀着万分激动的心情，一遍又一遍地学习。毛主席的伟大教导，句句说到了她的心坎上。胡清碧回顾自己在部队中成长的过程，深有体会地说：知识分子出身的技术人员，只有坚决走毛主席指出的同工农兵结合的道路，走理论和实践相结合的道路，才能彻底改造世界观，更好地为人民服务。她决心永远听伟大领袖毛主席的话，坚决走毛主席指引的道路，永远不脱离工农兵，永远做工农兵的小学生。　本报通讯员
