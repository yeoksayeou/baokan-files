The exhibition hall dedicated to the heroic deeds of Comrade Cai Yongxiang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, has been completed in Hangzhou. On October 28, thousands of military personnel and civilians in Hangzhou held a grand ceremony to mark the completion of the exhibition hall. The attendees resolved to better learn from Comrade Cai Yongxiang's unyielding loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The exhibition hall is built on the northern end of the Qianjiang Bridge, on Moon Wheel Mountain, where Comrade Cai Yongxiang once stood guard. In the center of the main hall stands a full-body statue of the great leader Chairman Mao. The exhibition hall has four exhibition rooms displaying Comrade Cai Yongxiang's collection of Chairman Mao's works that he studied during his lifetime, notebooks filled with study notes and diaries, as well as articles he wrote criticizing the Cultural Revolution. It also displays the wooden planks he used to rescue the Red Guards' special train at the cost of his own life. Many of the exhibits and photographs vividly reflect how Comrade Cai Yongxiang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, deeply loved Chairman Mao, eagerly studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, and how he bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and sacrificed himself to rescue the Red Guards.

Leaders from the Zhejiang Provincial and Hangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees, including Wang Zida and Zhu Quilin, leaders from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang and Comrade Cai Yongxiang's former unit, as well as representatives from the workers', peasants', and students' revolutionary committees, attended the ceremony. Leaders from the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee, including Cheng Yetang, and Comrade Cai Yongxiang's father, Cai Baoyu, and brothers, Cai Yonglong and Cai Yongsheng, also attended the ceremony.
