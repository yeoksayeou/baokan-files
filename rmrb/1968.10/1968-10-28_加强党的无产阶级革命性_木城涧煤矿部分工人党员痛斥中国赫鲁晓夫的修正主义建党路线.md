In the midst of the vigorous struggle, criticism, and reform campaign, news has come of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on party rectification and building. The revolutionary workers and broad ranks of party members at the Mucity Gorge Coal Mine have actively thrown themselves into the new battle. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's proletarian line on party building, they have held criticism meetings to denounce the reactionary fallacies of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly exposing the evil plot of this old counter-revolutionary to push the revisionist line on party building.

The Communist Party is for class struggle

Zhang Dequan (party member) said:

The Chinese Khrushchev blathers on about how "now the counter-revolution has been largely dealt with, the landlords and rich peasants are finished, and the capitalists cannot engage in capitalist activities in the economy. The contradictions between enemy classes have been basically resolved." This is sheer nonsense. In the years since the founding of the country, when has class struggle ever ceased? The class enemy has not gone a single day without plotting against us. The Chinese Khrushchev insists there is no class struggle. His purpose is to make us forget about class struggle, abandon the dictatorship of the proletariat, disarm us communists ideologically, and let the class enemy freely engage in activities to restore capitalism. This is a pipe dream! We coal miners all have a history of blood and tears. The hatred of class oppression will never be forgotten. We will never fall for the Chinese Khrushchev's tricks.

I started working in the coal mines with my father at the age of twelve, toiling year-round in those dark, damp, and cramped pits, sweating buckets to fatten the capitalists. One day, the pit collapsed, breaking my father's leg. The workers, filled with indignation, went to demand that the capitalists improve safety measures. The capitalist snarled, "The pit is mine, the people are yours. There are no more conditions. A three-legged toad is hard to find, but there are plenty of two-legged paupers." The workers strongly demanded that my father be sent to the hospital for treatment, but the capitalist sent an accountant with three yuan and sixty cents, saying that we father and son had worked for three years, and after deducting food money, this was all the wages left. My father had been unconscious for half a day and had just come to, and hearing this, he was so angry that he glared and died. Such blood debts are not just mine alone! We will never be able to settle them! The Chinese Khrushchev denies class struggle and attempts to restore capitalism. This is absolutely unacceptable!

Peng Xingqing (party member) said:

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have overthrown the three great mountains and established the dictatorship of the proletariat. We workers have become the masters of the state. The capitalists used to ride on our heads, but now they are trampled under our feet. They are like scallions hanging from the rafters, withered leaves and scorched roots, but their hearts do not die. The Chinese Khrushchev actually says that those capitalists have peacefully entered socialism. He tries to cover our ears and eyes with the black cloth of tranquility, making us into political deaf-mutes and blind men. This is utterly reactionary. We communists must engage in class struggle. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "Never forget class struggle." If we forget class struggle, we will perish as a party, perish as a nation, and perish as individuals. We must never relax our revolutionary vigilance and must fight the revolution and engage in class struggle for life.

Only the dictatorship of the proletariat, not the bourgeoisie seizing the party

An Changtai (party member) said:

The Chinese Khrushchev talks about how "due to changes in the situation, class contradictions and contradictions between us and the enemy have been basically resolved at home." The fox visiting the chicken coop has no good intentions. His black words are smoke screens to incite ghosts and snakes to seize party power. The Chinese Khrushchev, this old counter-revolutionary, deeply understands that power is fundamental and party power is the core. He wants to seize the proletarian dictatorship, turning it into a bourgeois dictatorship, and the key to this is to first seize party power. Once the nature of the party is changed, power will be seized. The living facts of class struggle within our mine are exactly like this.

The capitalist roaders within the mine, following the instructions of their masters, in the work of developing party members, vigorously advocate "emphasizing performance." The purpose is to blur class lines and make people forget about class struggle. They only look at a person's "performance" and do not look at their entire history. Under the cover of "emphasizing performance," they recruit remnants of the Kuomintang and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists into the party. A Kuomintang lieutenant colonel with blood on his hands was brought into the party and seized economic power in the mine. There was also a big landlord and capitalist who was brought into the party and promoted to mine director, controlling production power. The capitalist roaders praised them to the skies. These guys are all experts at "managing, controlling, oppressing, and punishing" workers. The capitalist roaders praised them as "clever and resourceful," touting them as "red stewards." These strange phenomena are not all products under the big black umbrella of the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle"?

Yang Fushan (party member) said:

A small handful of capitalist roaders and ghosts and snakes within the mine have infiltrated the party and seized power, engaging in evil activities to restore capitalism. They advocate the "four banners": "material incentives, bonus banner"; "production first, business banner"; "quality first, profit banner"; "experts manage the mine, technology banner." They have made the mine chaotic. They propagate things like "gold star fountain pens, large flower thermos bottles, washing basins, drinking alcohol, eating meat, and banquet feasts, granting titles and high salaries." Isn't this an attempt to instill corrupt bourgeois ideology into the workers and conspire to restore capitalism?

Cao Youfen (new party member) said:

These ghosts and snakes have infiltrated the party, waving the banner of "the extinction of class struggle," engaging in activities to restore capitalism in the mine on one hand, and on the other hand, they vigorously exclude us workers and peasants from joining the party.

In 1954, I joined the league. With an unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, I eagerly applied to join the party and wrote an application that year. But more than ten years have passed, and each application I submitted received a cold response. I went to question them, and those guys laughed, "Hey, what's a girl joining the party for? After getting married and having children, the burden of life is enough, don't add the burden of being a party member." For twelve years, I was thus rejected from the party's door. Now, I see more clearly the black hearts of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. They are close to ghosts and snakes, but hate the working class and the laboring people.

Ma Hairong (new party member) said:

We "coal blackies" from humble backgrounds, do they even have eyes to look at us? With the determination to fight for the proletarian revolutionary cause for life, I managed to get someone who could write to help me write a party application and submit it, only to be rejected. The capitalist roaders called me to their office and asked, "Ma Hairong, I hear you want to join the party?" I eagerly said, "Yes, yes." He sat on the sofa, squinting his eyes, and said, "The desire to join the party is good, but to be a communist, you need to have some substance. Tell me, what are the duties of a party member? What are the rights?" I was taken aback. A coal blackie with no education, how could I memorize so many articles? I only know that I am infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and will always fight the revolution with the party. After leaving, I couldn't help but sigh to the heavens, "If this is how it is, it's harder for us workers to join the party than to climb to the sky!"

Living facts of class struggle are clearly laid out, the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to wave his big black umbrella of "the extinction of class struggle" to surrender and recruit, seize party power; to wave his big chopping knife of "the extinction of class struggle" to block the working class from joining their own party, this is absolutely impossible!

Swear to be vigorous vanguard fighters

Li Chengui (party member) said:

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly, "A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without expelling the dregs and absorbing fresh blood, the party will have no vigor." Chairman Mao's latest instructions speak the hearts of the working class. This is the great guideline for party rectification and building, and the fundamental guarantee for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism. We will resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In this round of party rectification and building in our coal mine, we will expel all traitors, spies, all counter-revolutionaries, die-hard capitalist roaders, class enemies, and degenerate elements who have infiltrated the party. At the same time, we will boldly absorb advanced elements of the proletariat into the party organization. These comrades, tempered by the great storms of the Cultural Revolution, have a high awareness of the two-line struggle and a strong sense of class struggle, and are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Some of these comrades have been selected to responsible positions in the party organization, ensuring that party power is firmly in the hands of outstanding communists.

For example, the outstanding party member Nie Lianju has always dared to engage in head-on struggles with the class enemy. During the Cultural Revolution, he led the broad ranks of communists and workers to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, adhere to principled struggles, and dare to seize power from a small handful of capitalist roaders within the party. In this great party rectification movement, he was elected by the broad ranks of party members and workers as the secretary of the second section party branch. He has worked even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's great theory, line, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forgetting class struggle, thoroughly exposing the cover of class struggle, and severely striking a small handful of class enemies. Recently, a counter-revolutionary clique hiding in the second section was stirring, attempting to create accidents and sabotage the party rectification and building movement. This matter was seen by Nie Lianju, who promptly led the broad ranks of workers to expose these bad elements, greatly boosting the morale of the working class, severely suppressing the arrogance of a small handful of class enemies, and giving the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" a resounding slap in the face. The workers unanimously praised Nie Lianju as a vanguard fighter for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Jia Zhenchun (party member) said:

Absorbing the fresh blood of the proletariat is a need of class struggle and a need to consolidate and develop the proletarian political party. In this round of party rectification and building in our mine, the outstanding worker Du Zhanjun, who has always stood on the front line of class struggle, was absorbed into the party. In the past, when a small handful of capitalist roaders held party power, this vanguard fighter of the proletariat had written more than eighty party applications, and because he dared to insist on principles and tirelessly struggle against the capitalist roaders, he was labeled a "troublemaker" and kept out of the party's door. In this round of party rectification and building, this advanced fighter, who has charged into the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines, was not only absorbed into the party but was also elected by his comrades as a committee member of the party branch of the mechanical and electrical department. After taking up his leadership position, he remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemy, a vigorous vanguard organization." He strictly demanded of himself, regarding inheriting and carrying forward the party's three fine traditions as a need for fighting the enemy. When he worked in the worker and PLA propaganda team at Beijing Petroleum University, he went deep among the masses, rooted in the grassroots, and settled in the classes, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the broad ranks of revolutionary teachers and students. The broad ranks of revolutionary teachers and students and the workers and PLA propaganda team comrades all said, "Comrade Du is truly a vanguard fighter in the struggle against the enemy."

The criticism meeting ended in a fervent atmosphere. The broad ranks of party members and workers at the Mucity Gorge Coal Mine vow to advance under the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, personally founded by Chairman Mao.

    加强党的无产阶级革命性
    ——木城涧煤矿部分工人党员痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线
    郭美松　杨志和　王道胜
    正在蓬蓬勃勃的斗、批、改高潮中，传来了伟大领袖毛主席关于整党建党的最新指示。木城涧煤矿的革命职工和广大党员积极投入了新的战斗。他们在毛主席无产阶级建党路线的鼓舞下，召开批判会痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭论”的反动谬论，彻底揭穿了这个老反革命推行修正主义建党路线的罪恶阴谋。
    共产党就是搞阶级斗争的
    张德泉（党员）说：
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“现在反革命搞得差不多了，地主富农也完了，资本家在经济上搞资本主义也搞不起来了。敌对阶级的矛盾基本上解决了。”真是睁着眼睛说瞎话。建国十几年来，哪时哪刻阶级斗争熄灭了？阶级敌人没有一天不在打我们的算盘。中国赫鲁晓夫硬说没有阶级斗争，他的目的就是要叫我们忘掉阶级斗争，放弃无产阶级专政，从思想上解除我们共产党员的武装，让阶级敌人放手去搞复辟资本主义的活动。这是梦想！我们煤矿工人都有一部血泪史。阶级恨、剥削苦，一辈子也忘不了。我们绝对不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当。
    我十二岁就跟爸爸下煤窑做苦工，长年在那又黑、又湿、又小的窑洞里挣扎，流尽身上汗，喂肥资本家。一天窑洞陷塌，把爸爸的一条腿砸断了。工友们气愤地去找资本家要求加强安全设备，资本家恶狠狠地说：“窑是我的，人是你的，再多的条件没有。三只脚的蛤蟆不好找，两条腿的穷鬼有的是。”工友们强烈要求将爸爸送医院治疗，资本家却打发个账房送出来三角六分钱，说我们父子二人干了三年，除去饭钱就剩下这几个工钱。爸爸昏迷了半天刚醒过来，听到这话，气得一瞪眼就死了。这样的血债何止我一家？我们永远也算不清！中国赫鲁晓夫抹杀阶级斗争，妄图复辟资本主义，这一千个不能，一万个不能！
    彭兴庆（党员）说：
    毛主席领导中国人民推翻了三座大山，建立了无产阶级专政，我们工人阶级做了国家的主人。资本家原来骑在咱们头上，现在被踩在脚底下。他们是吊梁的干葱，叶烂根焦心不死。中国赫鲁晓夫竟胡说那些资本家已经和平进入社会主义了。他妄图用太平无事这块黑布蒙住我们共产党员的耳朵和眼睛，叫我们成为政治上的聋子和瞎子。真是反动透顶。我们共产党员就是要搞阶级斗争。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”忘了阶级斗争，就会亡党、亡国、亡头。我们决不能松懈革命警惕性，一定要干一辈子革命，搞一辈子阶级斗争。
    只许无产阶级专政，不许资产阶级篡党
    安长太（党员）说：
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“因形势变化，阶级矛盾敌我矛盾，在国内基本上解决了。”黄鼠狼给鸡拜年不怀好主意。他这些黑话，是鼓动牛鬼蛇神夺党权的烟幕弹。中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命，深深懂得政权是根本，党权是核心。他要夺取无产阶级政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，关键的关键就是要先抓党权。把党的性质改变了，政权也就篡夺到手了。我们矿内活生生的阶级斗争事实，正是这样的。
    矿里走资派，秉承其主子的旨意，在发展党员工作上，拚命鼓吹什么“重在表现”。目的是模糊阶级界线，使人们忘记阶级斗争。只看一个人的“表现”，不看他的全部历史。就在这“重在表现”的幌子掩护下，把那些国民党的残渣余孽和地、富、反、坏、右网罗到党内。一个双手沾满了人民鲜血的国民党少校军官，被拉进了党内，并且攫取了矿里的经济大权。还有个大地主兼大资本家的坏家伙，也被拉入党内，晋升为矿长，掌握着生产大权。走资派把他们捧上了天。这些家伙一个个都是对工人实行“管、卡、压、罚”的能手。走资派却夸奖他们“足智多谋”，标榜成“红管家”。这些怪现象不都是中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭论”那把大黑伞下的产物吗？
    杨富山（党员）说：
    矿里的一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神，钻进党内，掌握了大权，大搞资本主义复辟的罪恶活动。他们大搞四大挂帅，即：“物质刺激，奖金挂帅”；“生产第一，业务挂帅”；“质量第一，利润挂帅”；“专家治矿，技术挂帅”。把矿山闹得乌烟瘴气。尽宣传什么“金星钢笔日记本，大花暖瓶洗脸盆，喝酒吃肉摆宴席，封官许愿加高薪”。这不是妄图向工人阶级灌输腐朽的资产阶级思想，阴谋搞资本主义复辟，又是什么？
    曹有芬（新党员）说：
    这些牛鬼蛇神钻进了党内，打起“阶级斗争熄灭论”的幌子，一面在矿山大搞资本主义复辟，一面极力排斥我们工农分子入党。
    一九五四年，我就入了团。我怀着无限忠于毛主席的红心，迫切要求入党，当年就写了入党申请书。可是十几年过去了，申请书一张又一张，每次得到的全是冰凉冰凉的回答。我去质问他们，那些家伙扑嗤一声笑：“嘿嘿，女孩子入个啥党？往后结了婚，有了孩子，生活担子就够受的，不要额外增加党员这副担子了。”十二年来我就是这样被拒绝在党的门外。现在，我更清楚地看出了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的黑心肠。他们亲的是牛鬼蛇神，恨的是工人阶级和劳动人民。
    马海荣（新党员）说：
    咱们“煤黑子”出身的大老粗，他们哪有眼珠子来瞧？我抱着为无产阶级革命事业奋斗一辈子的决心，好容易请了个能写的人帮着写了一份入党申请书交上去，想不到却碰了一鼻子灰。走资派把我叫到他的办公室问我：“马海荣，听说你要入党？”我连声说：“是呀，是呀。”他坐在沙发上眯着眼睛说：“入党愿望是好的，可是要当共产党员得要有点实货。你说说党员的义务有哪几条？权利是哪几项？”我一听傻了眼，一个煤黑子出身的人，没有上过学，哪能背这么多的条文？我只知道无限忠于毛主席，永远跟党干革命。出了门，我由不得对天叹了口气：“这么搞法，我们工人入党真比登天还难啊！”
    活生生的阶级斗争事实一桩桩明摆着，中国赫鲁晓夫妄图挥舞他那把“阶级斗争熄灭论”的大黑伞，招降纳叛，篡夺党权；挥舞他那把“阶级斗争熄灭论”的大砍刀，阻挡工人阶级加入自己的政党，这一万个办不到！
    誓做朝气蓬勃的先锋战士
    李成贵（党员）说：
    毛主席他老人家最近深刻指出：“一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”毛主席的最新指示，说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。这是整党建党的伟大纲领，是反修防修的根本保证。我们坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。在这次我们煤矿的整党建党运动中，我们把混进党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子、顽固不化的走资派、阶级异己分子、蜕化变质分子统统清除出去。同时大胆地吸收无产阶级先进分子加入党组织。这些同志，经过无产阶级文化大革命大风大浪的锻炼，两条路线斗争觉悟高，阶级斗争观念强，无限忠于毛主席。这些同志中，有的被选拔到党组织的负责岗位上来，使党权牢牢掌握在优秀的共产党员手里。
    例如，优秀党员聂连举同志，一贯敢于同阶级敌人作针锋相对的斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他带领广大共产党员和工人群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持原则斗争，敢于从党内一小撮走资派的手中夺权。在这次伟大的整党运动中，他被广大党员和工人群众推举为二段党支部书记后，更加努力地活学活用毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的伟大理论、路线、方针和政策，念念不忘阶级斗争，大揭阶级斗争盖子，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。最近，隐藏在二段的一个反革命小集团蠢蠢欲动，妄图制造事故，破坏整党建党运动。这件事被聂连举看在眼里，他及时带领广大工人群众把这帮坏家伙揭了出来，大长了我们工人阶级的志气，大灭了一小撮阶级敌人的威风，给了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”一记响亮的耳光。工人群众无不赞扬聂连举是无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的先锋战士。
    贾振春（党员）说：
    吸收无产阶级的新鲜血液，是阶级斗争的需要，是巩固和发展无产阶级政党的需要。在我矿这次整党建党时，一向站在阶级斗争前线的优秀工人杜占军被吸收入党了。过去在一小撮走资派把持党权时，这个无产阶级先锋战士曾经写入党申请书八十多份，就因为敢于坚持原则、向走资派作不疲倦的斗争，竟被扣上“调皮捣蛋”的帽子，被拒于党的大门之外。在这次整党建党运动中，这个在两个阶级、两条路线的激烈搏斗中冲锋陷阵的先进战士不但被吸收入了党，还被同志们选拔为机电科党支部委员。他担任领导工作后，牢记毛主席“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”的教导，严格要求自己，把继承和发扬党的三大优良作风看作是对敌斗争的需要。他在驻北京石油学院工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队工作时，深入群众，扎根于基层、落户于班级，和广大革命师生并肩战斗。广大革命师生和工人、解放军宣传队同志满意地说：“老杜同志真是对敌斗争的先锋战士。”
    批判会在激昂的气氛中结束，木城涧煤矿的广大党员和工人誓在毛主席亲自缔造的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党的领导下乘胜前进。
