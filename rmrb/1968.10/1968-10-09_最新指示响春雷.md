The latest directive thunders like spring thunder,
The master's heart beats like a war drum,
Before dawn breaks, he rises from bed,
Towards the factory, he rushes like the wind.

"The apprentice is elected to the revolutionary committee,
A thousand-pound burden is on his shoulders,
Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do,
We must not let him fall behind."

He searched for a long time but couldn't find,
Suddenly, he hears the roar of machines in the workshop:
"Who came so early?"
He pushes the door open, and it turns out to be his apprentice, Little Cui.

"Last night, the meeting went on till late,
Hurry back home and get some sleep!"
The master feigns anger and scolds him,
The apprentice's words of passion flow like a torrent:

"To always maintain the character of the working class,
You understand my feelings,
I haven't held the hammer for two days,
My heart feels so restless!"

The apprentice's words touch his heart,
The master is moved to tears,
The hammering sounds more joyful,
As if saying: Yes, yes, yes...

    最新指示响春雷
    张金栋
    最新指示响春雷，
    师傅心里战鼓催，
    天还不亮就起床呵，
    朝着厂子走如飞。
    “徒弟选入革委会，
    千斤重担挑肩上，
    毛主席咋说咱咋做，
    可不能让他掉了队。”
    找了半天没找到，
    忽听车间机器声如雷：
    “是谁来得这么早？”
    推门瞧，原来是徒弟小崔。
    “昨晚开会大半夜，
    赶快回家把觉睡！”
    老师傅假意扳脸把人训，
    小徒弟激情话儿如潮水：
    “永葆工人阶级本色，
    我的心情你体会，
    两天没摸大锤把，
    心里憋得真不是味！”
    徒弟话儿动心扉，
    师傅激动得淌热泪，
    咚咚汽锤更欢畅，
    好象在说：对，对，对……
