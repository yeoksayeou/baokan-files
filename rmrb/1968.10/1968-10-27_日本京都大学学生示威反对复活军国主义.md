Kyoto University students held a demonstration on the 26th to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and to protest against the "Self-Defense Forces" parade in the city.

The Japanese authorities, under the pretext of celebrating the establishment of the "Self-Defense Forces," held a parade in Kyoto with sixty tanks and armored vehicles participating, using the streets to propagate militarism. When this batch of tanks and armored vehicles passed by the Kyoto University Kumano student dormitory, five hundred patriotic students bravely rushed to the front of the tank convoy, throwing stones at the tanks and armored vehicles. The students held up banners reading, "We will stop the revival of Japanese militarism," and "We demand the dissolution of the Self-Defense Forces." The struggle of the patriotic students caused the "Self-Defense Forces" parade to fall into chaos and was forced to stop for a while.

The Sato government quickly dispatched a large number of armed police to suppress the demonstrating students, but the students tenaciously persisted in their struggle.

    日本京都大学学生示威反对复活军国主义
    据新华社二十六日讯  据东方通讯社报道：日本京都大学学生二十六日举行示威，反对美日反动派复活日本军国主义和抗议日本“自卫队”在市内举行阅兵式。
    日本当局以庆祝“自卫队”成立为名，在京都举行了有六十辆坦克和装甲车参加的阅兵式，沿街进行军国主义的宣传。当这批坦克和装甲车经过京都大学熊野学生宿舍时，五百名爱国学生勇敢地冲到坦克车队的前头，对准坦克和装甲车扔石头。学生们高举着标语牌，上面写着：“我们阻止复活日本军国主义”、“我们要求解散自卫队”。爱国学生的斗争使“自卫队”的阅兵式陷于混乱，并且一度被迫停下来。
    佐藤政府赶忙出动大批武装警察镇压示威学生，但是学生们顽强地坚持斗争。
