The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Liaoning College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, in collaboration with the People's Liberation Army, has earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the re-education of intellectuals. With deep proletarian feelings, they have united and educated the revolutionary youth, greatly developing the excellent situation of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	Raising the Awareness of Helping and Educating Revolutionary Youth

	After the workers' propaganda team entered the college, they discovered that due to the influence of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Liaoning, who had implemented a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist educational lines, the students had been deeply poisoned. Some students thought only of studying to become officials, seeking fame and fortune; they focused solely on memorizing books without engaging in politics, believing in "authorities," and admiring foreigners; they pursued large cities, large hospitals, and large research institutions, looking down on workers and peasants, and despising labor. This revisionist educational line, which caused the youth to detach from proletarian politics, from the workers and peasants, and from reality, greatly infuriated the members of the workers' propaganda team. The leaders of the workers' propaganda team, in order to raise the awareness of the team members to earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the educational revolution, first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and discuss the fundamental tasks of the working class entering various domains of the superstructure. This made everyone realize that Chairman Mao sent the working class into various domains of the superstructure to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation, precisely to ensure that the working class permanently occupies this battlefield. This greatly raised the enthusiasm of the workers' propaganda team members to help the revolutionary youth.

	Conducting Detailed Ideological and Political Work with Class Feelings

	Although the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team recognized the great significance of helping and educating the revolutionary youth, some team members could not correctly handle the fact that some revolutionary youth had made mistakes during the Cultural Revolution. The leaders of the workers' propaganda team felt that if this problem was not resolved, it would be impossible to conduct arduous and detailed ideological and political work among the revolutionary youth, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the re-education of intellectuals could not be implemented. Therefore, they organized the team members to study Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Students from old schools, the majority or a large number of them, can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of them have even made inventions and creations. However, they need to be re-educated under the correct leadership of the working class, peasants, and soldiers, to thoroughly change their old thoughts." They also studied the speech given by Comrade Jiang Qing on September 7th in Beijing at the celebration of the nationwide red revolution. During the study, by discussing the revolutionary youth's love for Chairman Mao and their achievements in the early and middle stages of the Cultural Revolution, they deepened their proletarian feelings for the revolutionary youth. An old worker said, "Chairman Mao said: 'Errors and setbacks have taught us and made us somewhat wiser.' The youth made mistakes, not only gaining experience and lessons but also undergoing tempering. Under Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the youth have learned from their experiences and lessons, quickly corrected their mistakes in class struggle, and become pioneers in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, tempering themselves to be even stronger than before." The more they discussed, the deeper and more ardent their class feelings for the revolutionary youth became. The worker comrades said: "We should love these revolutionary youth as we love our own children, helping and educating them. This is the responsibility of the working class." The members of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team immediately went deep into the classrooms, living and working with the students, using the advanced thoughts of the working class to re-educate the intellectuals. They carefully understood the ideological trends of each revolutionary youth, grasped their active thoughts; repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions with them; visited their families, understood the revolutionary history of the revolutionary youth, conducted class education; talked heart-to-heart with them repeatedly, helping each revolutionary youth who had made mistakes to unburden themselves and increase their awareness. One leader of a revolutionary mass organization, deceived by the capitalist roaders within the party, made serious mistakes and hesitated to expose them, causing the masses to be very angry. This student, from a poor peasant family, had his sister tortured to death in the old society because they couldn't afford medical treatment. Worker Wu Shanlu, seeing this student harmed by the capitalist roaders, felt very sad. He used the student's painful family history to awaken his class consciousness, talked to him seven times, repeatedly explaining that the revolutionary youth's mistakes were a matter of recognition and that being deceived is not a crime, and encouraged him to put down his burden and continue the revolution. Finally, this youth overcame his mental obstacles and actively participated in the struggle to expose the class struggle cover-up of the old party committee of the college.

	Protecting Revolutionary Youth and Directing the Spearhead at the Class Enemy

	During the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the students of this college once exhibited the phenomenon of attacking certain leaders who had made mistakes and not fighting against the capitalist roaders. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team realized that this was a matter of whether Chairman Mao's policy on correctly handling the red guards and intellectuals could be implemented. Therefore, they gathered the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helping them to criticize and repudiate their own mistakes, seriously summing up the experiences and lessons of the past two years in the Cultural Revolution, letting them see their own achievements and recognize their own mistakes, encouraging them to continue the revolution. On the other hand, they went deep into the masses, vigorously propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution in the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They also propagated the policy on correctly handling the red guards and intellectuals, guiding the masses to strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, correctly handling those leaders who had made mistakes in the struggle against the enemy, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle. The leaders who had made mistakes, after studying in the classes, raised their awareness, actively criticized and repudiated themselves in front of the masses, deeply summed up the experiences and lessons of their mistakes, and exposed the black hands that had instigated them to do evil. The masses, after hearing this, turned their anger towards the capitalist roaders. The revolutionary youth, together with those leaders, exposed the class struggle cover-up of the old party committee of the college, exposed the capitalist roaders and the black hands that had infiltrated the mass organizations, and unearthed the hidden class enemies. Chairman Mao's policy on correctly handling the red guards and intellectuals was implemented, the revolutionary youth were protected, and their revolutionary enthusiasm was fully mobilized. From the entire college to each class, a great criticism was launched against the capitalist roaders and reactionary academic "authorities." Revolutionary great unity was further consolidated. With the collaboration of the People's Liberation Army, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team had been in the college for less than forty days when the revolutionary red guards' congress and the revolutionary committee were established. The spiritual face of the revolutionary youth underwent great changes, their awareness of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively and consciously greatly increased, and the "three loyalties" activities were carried out more universally and deeply. Graduating students actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, happily going to factories, rural areas, and border regions. Currently, all revolutionary teachers and students in the college, to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are earnestly doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, better walking the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Under the initiative of the workers and the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, they are actively preparing to welcome the political camp of marching, laboring, and struggling, criticizing, and transforming.

    充分调动革命小将的积极性搞好学校斗批改
    驻辽宁中医学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队认真落实毛主席对知识分子再教育的最新指示，满腔热情地团结教育革命小将，发展了斗、批、改的大好形势
    本报讯　驻辽宁中医学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在解放军的配合下，为了落实毛主席关于对知识分子必须进行再教育的最新指示，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，对革命小将进行艰苦、细致的思想政治工作，提高了他们的两条路线斗争觉悟，充分调动了他们的革命积极性，有力地发展了斗、批、改的大好形势。
    提高帮助、教育革命小将的自觉性
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻这个学院后，了解到过去由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在辽宁的代理人，推行了一整套的反革命修正主义教育路线，使青年学生中毒很深。有的学生想的是读书做官，成名成家；做的是死啃书本，不问政治，迷信“权威”，崇拜洋人；追求的是大城市、大医院、大科研机关，轻视工农，轻视劳动。这种使青年学生脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，脱离实际的修正主义教育路线，激起了工人宣传队同志的极大气愤。工人宣传队的领导同志，为了提高宣传队员认真落实毛主席关于教育革命最新指示的自觉性，首先组织大家学习了毛主席的有关教导，讨论了工人阶级进驻上层建筑各个领域的根本任务，使大家认识到，毛主席派工人阶级进驻上层建筑各个领域，领导斗、批、改，就是要我们工人阶级永远占领这块阵地。这样，大大提高了工人宣传队队员帮助革命小将的积极性。
    满怀阶级感情进行细致的思想政治工作
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队虽然认识到帮助、教育革命小将的重大意义，但是由于有些革命小将在文化大革命中犯了一些错误，有的宣传队员不能正确对待。工人宣传队的领导同志感到这个问题不解决，就不可能对革命小将进行艰苦细致的思想政治工作，毛主席关于对知识分子再教育的最新指示就不能落实。于是就组织队员学习毛主席“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想”的伟大教导，和今年九月七日江青同志在北京市革命群众庆祝全国山河一片红大会上的讲话。在学习中，通过大谈革命小将热爱毛主席的本质，大摆革命小将在文化大革命初期和中期的功绩，加深了对革命小将的无产阶级感情。有个工人老师傅说，毛主席说：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了”。小将犯了错误，不仅使他们取得了经验教训，还得到了锻炼。在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，小将们吸取了经验教训，在阶级斗争中很快改正了错误，又成了斗、批、改中的闯将，锻炼得比以前更加坚强了。大家越谈对革命小将的阶级感情越深、越热爱。工人师傅说：对这些革命小将应当象对待自己的孩子那样热爱他们，帮助他们，教育他们，这是我们工人阶级应尽的责任。工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，立即深入班级，同学生实行“五同”，用工人阶级的先进思想对知识分子进行再教育。他们对革命小将，一个一个地摸清他们的思想脉络，抓好他们的活思想；同他们反复学习毛主席的一系列最新指示；走访他们的家庭，了解革命小将的家史，进行阶级教育；一遍又一遍地同他们谈心，逐个地帮助犯错误的革命小将解疙瘩、卸包袱，使他们很快克服了盲目性，增加了自觉性。有个革命群众组织的头头，因受党内走资派的蒙蔽，犯了严重错误，又迟迟不敢起来揭发，群众对他很气愤。这个学生，出身贫农家庭，在旧社会因为没钱治病，他的姐姐活活被折磨死。工人吴山禄看到这个学生被走资派坑害成这个样子，心里非常难过，便用他的这些苦难家史，启发他的阶级觉悟，先后七次找他谈话，反复说明革命小将犯错误是认识问题，以及受蒙蔽无罪的道理，并鼓励他放下包袱，继续革命。终于使这个小将解除了思想顾虑，积极投入了揭开学院旧党委的阶级斗争盖子的斗争。
    保护革命小将，把矛头对准阶级敌人
    这个学院的学生在斗、批、改中，一度出现了揪某些有错误的头头、不斗走资派的现象。工人毛泽东思想宣传队认识到，这是关系到毛主席关于正确对待红卫兵小将和知识分子的政策能不能落实的问题。于是，他们一方面把革命群众组织的头头集中起来开办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助他们斗私批修，认真总结两年来在文化大革命中的经验教训，既让他们看到自己的成绩，又认清自己的错误，鼓励他们继续革命，另一方面，又深入群众中，大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示，和关于正确对待红卫兵小将、知识分子的政策，引导群众严格区分两类矛盾，在对敌斗争中正确对待犯错误的头头，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。犯了错误的头头，由于经过学习班的学习，提高了觉悟，主动到群众中斗私批修，沉痛地总结了犯错误的经验教训，并当众揭发了指使他们干坏事的黑手。群众听了后，把对犯错误头头的气愤，变成对走资派的仇恨。广大革命小将同那些头头一起，揭开了学院旧党委的阶级斗争盖子，揪出了走资派和伸进群众组织的黑手，挖出了暗藏的阶级敌人。毛主席关于正确对待红卫兵小将和知识分子的政策落实了，革命小将得到了保护，革命积极性充分调动起来了。从全院到各个班级都对走资派、反动学术“权威”，展开了一场革命大批判，革命大联合得到了进一步巩固，在解放军的配合下，工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学院不到四十天，学院红代会和革委会就成立了。革命小将的精神面貌发生了很大变化，活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性大大提高，“三忠于”活动开展得更加普遍深入。应届毕业生积极响应毛主席接受工农兵再教育的伟大号召，个个愉快地走向工厂、走向农村、走向边疆。目前，全院革命师生为了落实毛主席的最新指示，认真搞好斗、批、改，更好地走同工农兵相结合的道路，在工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的倡议下，正在积极迎接边行军、边劳动、边搞斗、批、改的政治野营。　（沈勤支）
