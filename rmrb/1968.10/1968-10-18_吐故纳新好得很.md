Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "A person has arteries and veins, and through the heart, blood circulates. They also need to breathe through the lungs, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is exhaling the old and inhaling the new. A proletarian party must also exhale the old and inhale the new to remain vigorous. Without removing waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lose its vitality." Chairman Mao's profound instruction speaks to the hearts of our working class and provides us with a powerful ideological weapon to carry out party rectification and building work. Linking this to the actual class struggle in our factory, we understand that Chairman Mao's "exhaling the old and inhaling the new" means to firmly grasp class struggle, take class struggle as the key, and carry out party rectification and building work. We must expel the handful of class enemies who have infiltrated the party, and all the "waste" and "carbon dioxide," and absorb into the party the excellent fighters of the revolutionary rebels who are infinitely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This will make the party organization vigorous and continuously enhance its combat effectiveness, uniting the entire party under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought and marching forward bravely.

"Exhaling the old and inhaling the new" within the party reflects the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths. It is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, and between the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and revisionism and various bourgeois ideologies. The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is a large-scale open-door party rectification movement carried out through revolutionary methods. In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents attempted to restore capitalism and change the color of our party and state, crazily promoting the revisionist party-building line. The old party committee in our factory, a handful of capitalist-roaders, followed the counter-revolutionary intentions of the Chinese Khrushchev, promoting the "whole people's party," surrendering and recruiting traitors, forming cliques, and pulling a batch of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries into the party. They also spread the fallacy that "good production, good technology, is a good party member." Their standard for recruiting new party members was to be "obedient" and "cultured"; while for revolutionary workers who insisted on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and dared to resist and struggle against actions and words that did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, they regarded them as thorns in the eye and flesh in the bone, and struck them down with the "crime" of being "naughty and mischievous" and "poorly cultured." Although we revolutionary rebel workers had red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao, the party, and the people, and strongly requested to join the party, writing multiple party membership application reports, they always ignored us, keeping us out of the party for a long time.

The stormy winds of the proletarian cultural revolution have lifted the lid on the class struggle of the old factory party committee, revealing the facts of class struggle that are shocking to the eye. It turns out that these handful of people are class enemies who have infiltrated the party, wearing the cloak of Communist Party members but acting like the Kuomintang. This handful of class enemies who have infiltrated the party are the "waste" and "carbon dioxide," the big hidden dangers within our party. If we do not resolutely eliminate them, they will harm the body of our party.

Exhaling the old and inhaling the new is an objective law of nature and class struggle, a great truth. If the party organization does not grasp class struggle and exhale the old and inhale the new, it will lose its revolutionary nature and combat effectiveness, and thus lose its vitality. After removing the "waste" and absorbing fresh blood, our great, glorious, and correct party will be even more vigorous.

Recently, we, representing the working class of Guizhou, went to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations and saw our working class's greatest leader, Chairman Mao. Standing by the side of our great leader Chairman Mao, we made a resolution to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and continuously remove the "waste" from our minds, infusing Mao Zedong Thought into our blood, striving to become honorable members of the Communist Party of China as soon as possible.

    吐故纳新好得很
    贵阳棉纺厂工人　陈谷熙　邱学文　余光先
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”毛主席这一深刻的教导，说出了我们工人阶级的心里话，给我们搞好整党、建党工作一个强大的思想武器。联系我厂阶级斗争的实际，我们理解毛主席提出的“吐故纳新”，就是要狠抓阶级斗争，以阶级斗争为纲，搞好整党、建党工作，把混入党内的一小撮阶级敌人，把那些“废料”“二氧化碳”统统清除出去，把无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的革命造反派的优秀战士吸收入党，使党组织朝气蓬勃，不断提高战斗力，使全党团结在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，奋勇前进。
    “吐故纳新”，反映在党内就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，就是无产阶级战胜资产阶级，社会主义战胜资本主义，毛主席的革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线，战无不胜的毛泽东思想战胜修正主义和形形色色的资产阶级思想。我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，就是一次以革命的方法进行的空前规模的开门整党运动。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义，妄图使我们的党和国家改变颜色，疯狂地推行修正主义的建党路线。我厂旧党委内一小撮走资派，就是秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命意旨，搞“全民党”，招降纳叛，结党营私，把一批叛徒、特务、反革命分子拉入党内。他们还大量散布什么“生产好，技术好，就是好党员”的谬论。他们吸收新党员的标准，就是要“听话”、“有修养”；而对于坚持毛主席革命路线、敢于对不符合毛泽东思想的错误言行进行抵制、斗争的革命工人，他们却视为眼中钉、肉中刺，以“调皮捣蛋”“修养差”的“罪名”横加打击。尽管我们革命造反派工人怀着忠于毛主席，忠于党，忠于人民的红心，强烈要求入党，写了多次入党申请报告，但他们始终置之不理，把我们长期关在党的门外。
    无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨，揭开了旧厂党委阶级斗争的盖子，揭露出来的阶级斗争事实，真是触目惊心。原来这一小撮家伙，是混入党内的阶级敌人，是披着共产党员外衣的国民党。这一小撮混入党内的阶级敌人，就是“废料”“二氧化碳”，是我们党内的大隐患，如果不坚决清除掉，就要损伤我们党的肌体。
    吐故纳新，这是自然界和阶级斗争的客观规律，是伟大的真理。党组织不抓阶级斗争，不吐故纳新，就失去了革命性，战斗性，也就没有了朝气。清除了“废料”，吸收了新鲜血液，我们伟大、光荣、正确的党就能更加朝气蓬勃。
    最近，我们代表贵州的工人阶级到北京参加国庆观礼，见到了我们工人阶级最伟大的领袖毛主席。我们在伟大领袖毛主席身边就下了决心，一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，不断清除自己头脑里的“废料”，把毛泽东思想溶化在自己的血液里，争取早日做一个光荣的中国共产党党员。
