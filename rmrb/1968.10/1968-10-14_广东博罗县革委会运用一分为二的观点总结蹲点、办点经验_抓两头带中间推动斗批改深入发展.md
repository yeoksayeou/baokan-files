The Revolutionary Committee of Boluo County, Guangdong, with the help of the PLA's support-left personnel, has used the principle of "two-part contradiction" to summarize experiences from sitting and establishing points. They have actively improved their work, establishing points in both advanced and backward areas, grasping both ends and leading the middle, thus promoting the continuous deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the county.

In the process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the leading members of the county's Revolutionary Committee have generally gone to grassroots units to sit and establish points, achieving certain successes. The three communes of Huangshandong, Longhua, and Fishery, where the leading members of the county's Revolutionary Committee personally sat and established points, have created many experiences in promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, in carrying out revolutionary criticism, cleaning up class ranks, and building the party. These experiences have played a driving role in the work of many communes and production brigades, and people from various places within and outside the province have come to visit and learn. Amidst the praise, some members of the Revolutionary Committee and staff have developed a sense of complacency, believing that the work of establishing points is almost complete. However, the actual situation is that there are still shortcomings in the work of establishing points: members of the Revolutionary Committee go to advanced units to establish points more often than to "difficult" units; they promote the experiences of advanced units more often than the experiences of advanced units promoting backward ones and backward units becoming advanced. They have not fully achieved the goal of grasping both ends and leading the middle. After discovering this situation, the PLA's support-left personnel promptly helped the leading members and staff of the county's Revolutionary Committee to study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings. Together, they used the principle of "two-part contradiction" to summarize the work of establishing points in the previous period, affirming the achievements, finding the weak links, and clarifying the direction for progress. Through study, everyone clearly recognized that the purpose of establishing points is to gain experiences at the points to guide the work on the surface, so as to quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in all units. To achieve this goal, it is not only necessary to establish points in advanced units but also, and more importantly, to establish points in backward, "difficult," and so-called "wasp nests" units. Only in this way can the work on the surface be better guided.

In the process of summarizing the work of the previous period, some members of the Revolutionary Committee and staff also exposed their active thoughts of fearing to establish points in "difficult" units. They were afraid that the masses in those units would be difficult to mobilize and the work would be difficult to carry out; they were afraid of not achieving anything and losing face; they were afraid of not being able to account for their work if it went wrong. In short, the bourgeois "self" was at work in their minds, lacking the courage to establish points in "difficult" units. The PLA's support-left personnel, in response to these active thoughts, studied Chairman Mao's teachings with everyone: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go. This is what a good comrade should do." Everyone used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely struggle against the bourgeois "self" in their minds, further criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, and consciously purging the remnants of the "join the party to become an official" theory. Through self-criticism and the struggle against revisionism, they raised the question of whether they were willing to go to "difficult" units to establish points and whether they could further carry forward the party's three major styles in the process of establishing points to the height of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to those "difficult" units, rely on the masses, do a good job in the revolution, promote production, and in the struggle, transform our worldview and gain experience in transforming the objective world.

After summarizing and studying, the awareness and self-awareness of the leading members and staff of the county's Revolutionary Committee regarding establishing points have greatly improved. To better grasp both ends and lead the middle, the county's Revolutionary Committee decided to continue establishing points in advanced areas while also selecting more than 1,200 people from the county, commune, and brigade levels to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to backward areas to establish points. The PLA's support-left personnel took the lead in going to "difficult" units. Changning Commune's Sulao Brigade is located in a remote mountainous area where class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. Under the control of class enemies, this brigade became a backward unit known as a "wasp nest." The military representative of the county's Revolutionary Committee led the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to sit and establish points here, conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, mobilize the masses extensively and deeply, carry out struggles against the enemy, clean up class ranks, and finally, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, uncovered the class struggle cover of this brigade, exposing five class enemies who had been hidden for a long time and buried deeply. The entire brigade's face was completely changed.

The Standing Committee member of the Revolutionary Committee and former deputy county magistrate, Meng Zhaoping, used to be aloof and rarely connected with the masses. After joining the Revolutionary Committee, his style of work changed, but he still often sat and established points in advanced units and rarely went to backward areas. He studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, struggled against his selfishness, and decided to further change his style of work, going to backward units to sit and establish points, and in the struggle, better transforming himself and doing new deeds for the people. He led the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to the backward Electric Pump Station, put down his airs, humbly learned from the workers, and got as dirty with oil as the workers did. He often went deep into the workshops, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes based on the workers' active thoughts, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions in combination with the actual situation of the Electric Pump Station, organized the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism, and focused on cleaning up class ranks and building the party. In just over three months, this backward unit of the Electric Pump Station became one of the advanced units in Huicheng District.

Because the Revolutionary Committee of Boluo County grasped both ends and established points in both advanced and backward units, they achieved successes. Therefore, in addition to vigorously promoting the series of advanced experiences in struggle, criticism, and transformation from the three advanced points of Huangshandong Brigade, Longhua Brigade, and Fishery Brigade, they also promoted the experiences of more than ten backward units becoming advanced in revolutionary criticism, cleaning up class ranks, and building the party, such as Electric Pump Station, Shenhu Brigade, Yubu Brigade, Huangzhu Brigade, Bazhai Brigade, and Shuodongpu Brigade. The masses generally reflected that these experiences are very practical, representative, inspiring, visible, and usable. We welcome them very much. These experiences from the points, when promoted on the surface, resulted in the original 25 advanced points in the county becoming even better, and more than 60 backward units rushed to catch up, making the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit hot and practical.

    广东博罗县革委会运用一分为二的观点总结蹲点、办点经验
    抓两头带中间推动斗批改深入发展
    革委会既在先进地区办点，又在落后地区办点，除大力推广黄山洞大队等先进点斗批改的先进经验，还推广了电排总站等后进变先进样板的大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党等方面的经验。群众普遍反映说，这些经验很实际，看得见，用得上
    新华社广州十二日电　广东省博罗县革命委员会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，用一分为二的观点总结蹲点、办点工作，并积极改进，既在先进地区办点，又在落后地区办点，抓两头，带中间，推动全县的斗、批、改不断深入发展。
    博罗县革委会前段在落实毛主席一系列最新指示的过程中，领导成员普遍到基层单位蹲点，取得了一定成绩。县革委会领导成员亲自蹲点的黄山洞、龙华、渔业等三个大队，在把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段，在开展革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党建党等方面，都创造了不少经验，对不少社队的工作起了推动作用，省内外各地也有不少人前来参观学习。在一片赞扬声中，有些革委会成员和工作人员产生了自满情绪，认为办点工作搞得差不多了。而实际状况是办点工作还有不足之处：革委会成员到先进单位办点多，到“老大难”单位办点少；推广先进单位的经验多，推广先进促后进和后进变先进的经验少，还没有全面地做到抓两头，带中间。解放军支左人员发现这种情况后，便及时帮助县革委会成员和工作人员学习毛主席的有关教导，同他们一道运用一分为二的观点，总结前段办点工作，肯定成绩，找出薄弱环节，明确前进的方向。通过学习，大家明确地认识到办点的目的，是为了在点上取得经验，指导面上的工作，以利于在所有单位迅速落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。而要达到这一目的，就不仅需要在先进单位办点，更需要在后进的、“老大难”的和被称为“马蜂窝”的单位办点，这样，才能更好的指导面上的工作。
    在总结前段工作的过程中，有的革委会成员和工作人员还亮出了怕到“老大难”单位办点的活思想，他们怕那些单位群众不好发动，工作难开展；怕搞不出名堂不光彩；怕搞不好不好交账，总之是资产阶级的“私”字在头脑里作怪，缺乏到“老大难”单位办点的勇气。解放军支左人员针对这些活思想，又和大家一道学习伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”大家以毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗自己头脑中的资产阶级的“私”字，进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，自觉肃清“入党当官”论的余毒。经过斗私批修，他们把愿不愿到“老大难”单位去办点，能不能在办点中进一步发扬党的三大作风，提到忠不忠于毛主席的革命路线的高度去认识。他们说，我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，到那些“老大难”单位去，依靠群众，抓好革命，促进生产，并在斗争中改造自己的世界观，取得改造客观世界的经验。
    经过总结、学习，县革委会成员和工作人员对办点的认识和自觉性都大大提高。为了更好地抓两头，带中间，县革委会决定在先进地区继续办点的同时，从县、社、大队各级抽调了一千二百多人，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，到工作后进的地区去办点，解放军支左人员带头到“老大难”单位去。长宁公社酥醪大队地处边远山区，阶级斗争非常尖锐、复杂。在阶级敌人的把持下，这个队变成了被称为“马蜂窝”的落后单位。县革委会的军队代表便带头率领毛泽东思想宣传队在这里蹲点，办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席最新指示，广泛深入地发动群众，开展对敌斗争，清理阶级队伍，终于和贫下中农一起揭开了这个大队的阶级斗争盖子，把五个藏得很久、埋得很深的阶级敌人挖了出来，全大队面貌焕然一新。
    县革委会常委、原副县长孟昭平，过去高高在上，很少联系群众。他参加革委会后，作风有了改变，但也是常在先进单位蹲点，很少到落后地区去。他学习了毛主席的有关教导，狠斗了私心，决心进一步转变作风，到后进单位去蹲点，在斗争中更好地改造自己，为人民立新功。他带领毛泽东思想宣传队到了工作落后的电排总站后，放下架子，甘当小学生，拜工人为师，工人身上有多少油污，他身上也有多少油污。他经常深入车间，针对职工活思想办毛泽东思想学习班，结合电排总站实际情况，落实毛主席最新指示，组织群众开展革命大批判，狠抓清理阶级队伍、整党等工作，仅三个多月时间，电排总站这个后进单位便一跃而成为惠阳专区的先进单位之一。
    博罗县革委会由于抓了两头，在先进单位和落后单位同时办点，都取得了成就，因此除了大力推广黄山洞大队、龙华大队、渔业大队等三个先进点的斗、批、改等一系列先进经验外，还先后推广了电排总站、深湖大队、于布大队、黄竹大队、坝子大队、水东陂大队等十多个后进变先进样板的大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党等方面的经验。群众普遍反映说，这些经验很实际，有代表性，听了启发大，看得见，用得上，我们非常欢迎。这些点上的经验，在面上推广的结果，全县原来的二十五个先进点，工作好上加好，六十多个后进单位也急起直追，迎头赶上，各单位的斗、批、改搞得热火朝天，扎扎实实。
