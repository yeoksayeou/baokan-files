	Staff members from the mechanical department were recently sent to the mineral powder brick workshop. Old worker Zhang Guokai noticed that Wang Shifu, a cadre from the mechanical department, seemed to have some issues with his attitude. He always seemed distracted while working and often wandered alone to the casting workshop behind the mineral powder pile, looking around. What was going on?

	After some investigation, it turned out that Wang Shifu had been sent to this workshop and was always dealing with mineral powder and coal dust, which made his whole body as black as a coal ball. He was not content with his work. He had heard someone say, "A day of mineral powder bricks is not as good as a puff of smoke from casting." He wanted to transfer to the casting workshop, learn some skills, become a skilled worker, and secure an "iron rice bowl."

	Old Zhang thought, "Wang Shifu has come down to the workshop, but his thoughts are still trapped in the poison of revisionism!"

	That evening, Old Zhang and Wang Shifu, with the Little Red Book in hand, studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by our Party are revolutionary armies. This army of ours is entirely for the liberation of the people, and it is thoroughly for the people's interests to work," and "To fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." They together criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the reactionary fallacy of "public ownership with private interests." Old Zhang spoke earnestly, "The cadres sent down from the departments are an important part of the struggle, criticism, and reform in the factory. They are a long-term plan to defend and consolidate the new political power—the revolutionary committee. In this matter, there must be no private interests at all; otherwise, one would fall into the trap of the 'fusion of public and private' theory of the Chinese Khrushchev." After hearing Old Zhang's sincere criticism, Wang Shifu revealed his thoughts of wanting to secure an "iron rice bowl."

	When the topic of the "iron rice bowl" came up, it reminded Old Zhang of his bitter past. Before liberation, Old Zhang was a fourth-level worker in a factory. He thought that with this bit of skill, he had an "iron rice bowl." However, one day, the machine suddenly malfunctioned and crushed his arm. The heartless capitalist not only refused to treat him but also said cruelly, "A three-legged toad is hard to find, but there are plenty of two-legged people. Get out, you good-for-nothing!" Old Zhang was kicked out of the factory, losing his "iron rice bowl" and having to beg for food. At this point, Old Zhang became emotional and said, "In the old society, what kind of 'iron rice bowl' was there? If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us workers to rise up, even if you were a twelfth-level worker, you would still have to be a slave to the capitalists." Old Zhang's words deeply moved Wang Shifu, and he was so touched that tears welled up in his eyes. On the spot, he pledged to Chairman Mao that he would definitely learn well from the working class, thoroughly reform his worldview, and resolutely smash the "iron rice bowl" of bourgeois individualism.

	From then on, Wang Shifu changed. He was no longer afraid of getting dirty or tired. While working, he also propagated Chairman Mao's latest directives and became an active participant in the workshop's revolutionary and productive efforts.

    一定很好地向老工人学习
    科室人员下放到矿粉砖车间不久，老工人张国开就觉得原机动科下放干部王世富情绪有点不对头，干活总是心不在焉，还时常一个人跑到矿粉堆后边的铸造车间东瞅瞅西看看。这是怎么回事呢？经过了解，原来王世富下放到这个车间后，因为整天打交道的是矿粉煤面子，浑身滚得象个煤球，所以一直不安心工作。他听人说：“托一天矿粉砖，不如铸造冒股烟。”就一心想调到铸造车间，学点技术，做个几级工，捞个铁饭碗。老张心想：王世富人虽然下到车间了，可思想还在修正主义流毒中打圈呢！
    晚上，老张和王世富手捧红宝书，共同学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”，“要斗私，批修”。一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，和“大公有私”的反动谬论。老张语重心长地说：“下放科室人员是工厂里斗批改的重要组成部分，是捍卫和巩固新生政权——革命委员会的百年大计。在这个问题上是掺不得半点私心的，否则，就上了中国赫鲁晓夫‘公私溶化’论的当了。”小王听了老张中肯的批评，亮出了自己想捞个铁饭碗的活思想。
    提起“铁饭碗”，勾起了老张辛酸的往事。解放前，老张在一个工厂里是四级工。他以为有这点技术，也算个铁饭碗。不料，有一次机器突然发生故障，把他的胳膊给轧断了，狠心的资本家不但不给他治疗，还恶狠狠地说：“三条腿的蛤蟆难找，两条腿的人有的是。白吃饭的穷小子滚蛋！”老张被撵出工厂，丢了“铁饭碗”，拿起了讨饭碗。说到这里，老张激动地说：“在旧社会有什么铁饭碗？要不是毛主席他老人家领导咱工人翻身，你就是个十二级工也得给资本家当牛做马。”老张的话句句打动着王世富的心，他激动得泪水不住地在眼眶里打转。当场向毛主席表决心，一定很好地向工人阶级学习，彻底改造自己的世界观，坚决砸碎那资产阶级个人主义的“铁饭碗”。
    从此王世富变了样，不怕脏、不怕累，一边劳动，一边宣传毛主席的最新指示，成了车间抓革命促生产的积极分子。
