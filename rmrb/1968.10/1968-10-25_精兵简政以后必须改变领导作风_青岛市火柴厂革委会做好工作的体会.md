After implementing streamlining and downsizing, how does one resolve the contradiction of having fewer people and more tasks? The Qingdao Match Factory Revolutionary Committee has a crucial experience: leadership styles must be changed. This means firmly implementing the Party's policies, directly relying on the masses, and being good at listening to the opinions of the masses. If streamlining and downsizing is merely understood as reducing bloated organizations and reducing the number of full-time personnel, without eliminating the old bourgeois bureaucratic habits in one's thinking and style, and without establishing a new leadership style and learning the Party's leadership methods, the work after streamlining and downsizing will not be able to proceed, and soon the reduced organizations will expand again, and the reduced personnel will increase again, leading to a return to the old ways.

Identifying the Root Cause

The revolutionary workers of the Qingdao Match Factory, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, have undergone two rounds of streamlining, eliminating bloated organizations, and reducing full-time personnel from over a hundred to seventeen. However, the problem in thinking has not been solved. Sixteen committee members are all stuck in the office, falling into the trap of bureaucratism. Many issues are often passed around without being resolved. Thus, complaints and thoughts of returning to the old ways emerge:

"Are we too streamlined? There are so many things we can't handle."

"Let's have 'one team, two sets of personnel,' find a few people to temporarily help out."

"Sigh, just increase the number of full-time personnel."

This is a dangerous signal of backsliding, a reflection of the old bourgeois ideas, old styles, and old habits attacking the new organizations. The military representative and the Revolutionary Committee immediately became alert. They quickly organized the committee members and staff to study Chairman Mao's works with these problems in mind.

"The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." Chairman Mao's directive is like a golden key, opening the minds of the committee members. They realized: the problem is not that there are too few full-time personnel, but that there is too little Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, too little mass perspective, the old frameworks have not been broken, and the fundamental issue of connecting with the masses has not been well resolved. One leader shared his deep lessons with everyone: "The more full-time cadres there are, the farther they are from the masses. The path of expanding organizations and increasing personnel must not be taken. As long as we go among the masses and mobilize them, the problem of having fewer people and more tasks will be well resolved."

The root cause was found, the direction was clear, and the Revolutionary Committee left only four people to handle daily work. The rest of the committee members were all sent down to work and strengthen grassroots leadership.

Following from Above, Relying on the Masses

With fewer full-time personnel, there are still many tasks to be done. How to carry out the work? The factory Revolutionary Committee's important experience is to "follow from above and rely on the masses." "Following from above" means closely following the great strategic deployment of Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian headquarters; "relying on the masses" means mobilizing workers to participate in enterprise management.

Most committee members work in the workshops, with their hearts beating together with the workers and sweating together, uniting a large number of core forces around the Revolutionary Committee, and having a clear understanding of the actual situation. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest directives and the battle cries of the proletarian headquarters come out, they can be quickly conveyed to the masses through the core forces, organizing the masses to study and discuss repeatedly in combination with the actual situation, and promptly implement them. At the same time, the factory Revolutionary Committee also holds Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to different central tasks at different times, using Mao Zedong Thought to train the core forces of each team, and the core forces return to the teams to improve and mobilize other masses.

Cadres go among the masses, arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and the masses also automatically do political and ideological work. Many teams have achieved: good thoughts are encouraged in a timely manner, good trends are actively supported, difficulties are helped mutually, and problems are solved immediately. A situation of "good deeds are praised, bad deeds are criticized" has formed in the factory. The thick political atmosphere has inspired the workers' enthusiasm for managing the enterprise. In the past, the work of the office personnel was actively done by the workers; when problems arose in production, the workers actively managed them, and many "non-committee members who act like committee members" emerged. The workers said: "In the past, the capitalist roaders treated us as slaves of rules and regulations. Now, we have truly become the masters of the factory. We must take the attitude of masters to manage the factory better." In late July of this year, some workers were absent due to illness, affecting production. The factory Revolutionary Committee immediately explained the situation to the masses and studied Chairman Mao's works with them, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. Everyone came up with ideas and solutions. Eighty percent of the workers in the entire factory voluntarily worked overtime, finally overfulfilling the plan.

Focusing on Key Points to Lead the Way

The committee members, while working, also planned to focus on typical examples and set models to promote the work of the entire factory.

After the work of cleaning up class ranks began in the factory, a committee member went to the oil and drug group, where there was a lack of unity and anarchist thoughts were rampant. He conducted in-depth investigations and did a lot of ideological and political work, mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm, raising the masses' awareness, and finally exposing a counter-revolutionary who was secretly causing trouble. This incident shocked the entire factory and strongly promoted the work of cleaning up class ranks. During the period of carrying out the revolutionary criticism, the factory Revolutionary Committee summarized the experience of the unloading group in carrying out the revolutionary criticism and promoted it, immediately creating a "learn from the unloading group, catch up with the unloading group" enthusiasm throughout the factory, quickly forming a high tide of revolutionary criticism.

Setting an Example

In the past, some committee members were floating above, and when the masses came to them with problems, they couldn't refuse, but they didn't understand the situation, so they could only vaguely respond, which the masses were very dissatisfied with, greatly affecting the prestige of the Revolutionary Committee. However, after the committee members went to the workshops, working and studying with the masses, and engaging in class struggle together, they had a clear grasp of the situation, saw problems accurately, acted decisively, and solved problems quickly, so their words were also effective. The masses trusted them more and more, and when there were problems, they were willing to find them to solve. In this way, many problems were solved at the grassroots level, fully playing the leading role of the Revolutionary Committee.

The model role of cadres is a silent command. Committee member Zhou Zishan went to the workshop and first worked on the slow-moving machines. Someone asked him to go to the fast-moving machines to work, and he immediately happily went to the fast-moving machines to work. Thus, a few people who did not want to work on the fast-moving machines also eagerly requested to go to the fast-moving machines to work, and those who were already working on the fast-moving machines worked even harder.

Because the Qingdao Match Factory Revolutionary Committee paid attention to the issue of leadership style, in the past few months, revolutionary production has continuously achieved remarkable results, demonstrating the great power of streamlining and downsizing.

    精兵简政以后必须改变领导作风
    ——青岛市火柴厂革委会做好工作的体会
    实行精兵简政以后，怎样解决人少事多这个矛盾呢？青岛市火柴厂革委会的一条重要经验是：必须改变领导作风。这就是坚决执行党的政策，直接依靠广大群众，善于听取群众意见的作风。如果把精兵简政仅仅理解为缩小庞杂机构、减少脱产人员，而不从思想上、作风上破除资产阶级旧官僚主义习气，树立崭新的领导作风，学会党的领导方法，精兵简政以后的工作，是无法展开的，过不了多久，缩小了的机构又会膨大，减少了的人员又会增加，精兵简政以后就会出现复旧现象。
    抓住“症结”
    青岛市火柴厂革命职工，遵照毛主席的教导，经过两次精简，砍掉了臃肿机构，脱产人员由一百多人减少到十七人。但是，思想没有解决问题。十六个委员全部蹲在办公室里，陷入事务主义圈子。一些事情常常你推我踢而不得解决。于是，埋怨情绪、复旧思想便冒出头来：
    “我们是不是精简得太多了？这么多的事情实在干不了。”
    “搞‘一套班子，两套人马’吧，找几个人临时帮帮忙。”
    “咳，干脆增加点脱产人员。”
    这是走回头路的危险信号，是资产阶级旧观念、旧作风、旧习惯势力向新机构进攻的反映。军代表和革委会立刻警觉起来，他们迅速组织革委会委员和工作人员带着这些问题学习毛主席著作。
    “国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”毛主席的指示象一把金钥匙，打开了委员们的心窍。他们明白了：原来，问题不是脱产人员少，而是自己头脑里毛泽东思想少，群众观点少，旧框框没破掉，联系群众的根本问题没有解决好。有的领导干部以自己的深刻教训对大家说：“脱产干部越多，脱离群众越远。扩大机构增加人员的回头路万万走不得。只要我们深入群众，把群众发动起来，人少事多的问题就会得到很好的解决。”
    “症结”找到了，方向明确了，革委会只留四个人主持日常工作，其余委员统统“带职”下放劳动，加强基层领导。
    跟上靠下
    脱产的人员少了，该作的事情还很多，怎样开展工作呢？厂革委会的一个重要体会就是“跟上靠下”。“跟上”，就是紧跟毛泽东思想和无产阶级司令部的伟大战略部署；“靠下”，就是发动工人群众参加企业管理。
    大多数委员在车间劳动，和工人们“心跳在一起，汗流在一起”，把大批骨干力量紧紧团结在革委会的周围，对实际情况也了如指掌。毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令一下来，就能通过骨干力量立刻贯彻到群众中去，迅速组织群众结合实际反复学习，深刻讨论，立即落实。同时，厂革委会还根据不同时期的不同中心任务，坚持举办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想培训各班组的骨干力量，由骨干力量回班组提高、发动其他群众。
    干部深入群众，用毛泽东思想武装群众，群众也自动地做政治思想工作。许多班组做到了：好思想随时鼓励，好苗头积极扶持，有困难互相帮助，有问题马上解决。一个“好事有人夸，坏事有人抓”的风气已在厂里形成。浓厚的政治空气激发了工人管理企业的积极性，以往科室人员的工作工人们主动去干；生产中出现了问题工人们主动去管，涌现出很多“不是委员的委员”。工人们说：“过去，走资派把我们当成规章制度的奴隶，现在，我们才真正成了工厂的主人，我们一定要拿出主人翁的态度来，把工厂管理得更好。”今年七月下旬，有些工人因病缺勤，影响了生产。厂革委会立即把情况向群众说明，并和群众一起学习毛主席著作，调动了广大工人的积极性。人人出主意，想办法，全厂百分之八十的职工自动义务加班，终于超额完成计划。
    抓点带面
    革委会的委员们在劳动中，还有计划地抓典型，树样板，用以推动全厂工作。
    清理阶级队伍的工作在工厂展开以后，一个厂革委会委员下到了内部不团结、无政府主义思想泛滥的油药小组。他进行了深入的调查研究，做了许多思想政治工作，调动了群众的积极性，提高了群众的觉悟，终于揪出了一个暗里捣鬼的反革命分子。这件事震动了全厂，有力地推动了清理阶级队伍的工作。正在开展革命大批判的时候，厂革委会总结了卸工小组开展革命大批判的经验，并加以推广，全厂立即出现一个“学卸工小组，赶卸工小组”的热潮，很快形成了革命大批判高潮。
    以身作则
    过去，有些委员浮在上面，群众有事找上门来，不答复不好看，要答复又不了解情况，只好含含糊糊地应付过去，群众很有意见，大大影响了革命委员会的威信。可是，委员们下到了车间以后，和群众一起劳动，一起学习，一起搞阶级斗争，情况掌握的明，问题看的准，办事脚跟硬，解决问题快，说话也就灵，群众越来越信任，有了问题都愿找他们解决。这样一来，很多问题都在基层得到解决，充分发挥了革委会的领导作用。
    干部的模范作用，是无声的命令。革委会委员周子山同志下到车间，先在慢车上劳动。有人要求他到快车上去劳动，他立刻愉快地到快车上去劳动。于是，少数不愿到快车上干活的人，也踊跃要求到快车上去干，在快车上干活的同志干得更起劲了。
    青岛市火柴厂革委会由于重视了领导作风的问题，几个月来革命生产不断取得显著成绩，显示了精兵简政的强大威力。
