Edition: 4

    The warrior's heart faces the sun,
    The soldier Jiang Guixiang,
    A book is kept in his chest,
    The soldier's eyes shine bright,
    A steel gun in his hand,
    The bayonet gleams with silver light.
    Everything for the revolution,
    The post is a battlefield,
    Diligently sending away the night,
    A smiling face greets the dawn.
    Fearless of storms and rain,
    Wearing snow and frost,
    Facing the red sun,
    His body is full of strength.
    The fighting spirit is great,
    The revolutionary will is like steel,
    Carrying a thousand-pound load,
    Bravely forging ahead.
    Words and deeds are consistent,
    The red heart forever faces the Party.
    For Chairman Mao,
    He would dare climb a mountain of knives.
    Never forget the class struggle,
    Hot blood writes a new chapter,
    Heighten vigilance,
    Firmly guard the post.
    Everything for the people,
    The red heart forever faces the sun.

    战士红心向太阳
    解放军战士　姜桂祥
    宝书怀中揣，
    战士眼睛亮，
    钢枪握在手，
    刺刀闪银光。
    一切为革命，
    哨位是战场，
    辛勤送黑夜，
    笑脸迎曙光。
    不怕暴风雨，
    戴雪又披霜，
    迎着红太阳，
    浑身是力量。
    战斗决心大，
    革命志如钢，
    身挑千斤担，
    勇敢向前闯。
    言行全一致，
    红心永向党。
    为了毛主席，
    刀山也敢上。
    不忘阶级苦，
    热血谱新章，
    提高警惕性，
    坚守哨位上。
    一切为人民，
    红心永远向太阳。
