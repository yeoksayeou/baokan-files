The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class, the participation of the working masses, and the cooperation with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, to form a revolutionary three-in-one combination with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools. In the countryside, the schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pronounced the death sentence on the bourgeois intellectuals' rule over the schools, greatly boosting the morale of the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants, and greatly dampening the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. With Chairman Mao's support, our poor and lower-middle peasants have a stiffer backbone, and we are determined to manage the schools and education, using Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the school battlefield. Our resolve is firm and unshakable, neither thunderstorms nor winds can sway it!

The poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools is something our ancestors never had. This is a great revolution, a fierce class struggle. When we started managing the schools, we heard all sorts of strange and bizarre talk. Among them, there were malicious attacks from a handful of class enemies. We must resolutely counterattack these villains, allowing them to behave only in an orderly manner, not allowing them to talk or act recklessly. There are also some intellectuals who grumble and are very discontented. This is not just about their views on the poor and lower-middle peasants; it is about their attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must clarify this issue.

"You poor and lower-middle peasants should not interfere with the Cultural Revolution of other units." This is wrong. The school is not an "external unit"; the school is where we cultivate our next generation. How to cultivate the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants is a major issue that concerns whether our country will change color, and it concerns the issue of anti-revisionism. Over the past decade, China's Khrushchev and his agents have pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, sheltering and promoting a group of spies, traitors, reactionary literati, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. These scoundrels, following their black masters, have been doing all sorts of tricks. They preach "intellectual education first," "grades as the criterion," and slander the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants as "stupid and clumsy," using every means to kick them out of the school gates. Some children of the poor and lower-middle peasants, even if they enter the school, are also corrupted. After finishing primary school, they do not love labor; after finishing middle school, they look down on their parents; after entering university, they do not even come to this mountain valley. Such schools are a big dyeing vat of revisionism! We poor and lower-middle peasants hate the revisionist educational line to the core. According to Chairman Mao's educational line, managing rural schools is an urgent demand and a revolutionary responsibility of the poor and lower-middle peasants. It is our duty, how can it be said to be "interference"?

"You peasants have no knowledge, you only know how to raise pigs, cows, and sheep, you don't know how to manage mathematics and science." This is the stench of bourgeois intellectuals, a fallacious argument that turns black into white.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is knowledge? Since the existence of class society, the world's knowledge has only two kinds: one is the knowledge of production struggle, and the other is the knowledge of class struggle." Those who think they are great intellectuals, how much knowledge do you really understand?

As for the knowledge of production struggle, some intellectuals only know that late-season rice is fragrant, but they do not know how late-season rice is grown; they only know that pork, beef, and mutton are delicious, but they do not know how to raise them, and they do not understand the dialectical relationship between raising pigs, cows, and sheep and developing agricultural production. Those who teach chemistry do not know how to use ammonia, and those who teach mathematics do not know how to calculate the accounts of the production team. Some university students came to the commune to participate in labor and actually cut off the beans on the ridges as firewood.

As for the knowledge of class struggle, let me ask those who think they are great intellectuals, do you really understand what class oppression and class exploitation are? Can you talk about the characteristics and specific manifestations of class struggle in the countryside in each period? I am afraid you cannot. Moreover, "when faced with storms, their position is very different from that of workers and the majority of laboring peasants. The former wavers, the latter is firm, the former is ambiguous, the latter is clear."

Today, the knowledge we talk about is the knowledge that combines theory with practice. We talk about managing schools, relying on Mao Zedong Thought. The working class and we poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest affection for Chairman Mao's proletarian feelings, the greatest love for Mao Zedong Thought, and the most resolute execution of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The working class and we poor and lower-middle peasants have always been at the forefront of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, with rich practical struggle knowledge. Under the leadership of the working class, we poor and lower-middle peasants have the qualifications and ability to manage the schools well!

"You have never run a school, can you do it?" Those bourgeois intellectuals always do not trust the poor and lower-middle peasants to manage schools. Just wait and see! "We can learn what we originally do not understand. We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." In the past, we were individual households producing, but today we have established collective economies, and they are getting better and better; in the past, we only knew how to grow single-season rice, but today we have started growing double-season rice, increasing the yield per mu from over 200 jin to over 1,000 jin; in the past, the ten-li barren hills here have now become a tea garden! Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we can change everything and create everything! Now, with Chairman Mao's educational policy as our guide, we poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely be able to thoroughly transform the schools ruled by bourgeois intellectuals!

What should we focus on in managing schools? It is to seriously implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's educational line, and firmly grasp class struggle without wavering. We must be vigilant against class enemies and those with ulterior motives who wear the mask of "welcome," pretend to be humble, and deliberately pile up trivial matters in front of you, making you fall into the trap of bureaucratism and lose the revolutionary direction. We must raise our revolutionary vigilance and must not fall for this trick.

Written after collective discussion by poor peasants Cai Changgen, Wang Fazhong, Sun Guorong, and Huang Jintang of Qingyun Commune, Lin'an County

### 贫下中农有志气有能力管好学校

    贫下中农有志气有能力管好学校
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席的最新指示，宣判了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的死刑，大长了工人阶级和贫下中农的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。有毛主席撑腰，我们贫下中农的腰杆更硬了，一定要管好学校，管好教育，用毛泽东思想占领学校阵地。我们这个决心下定了，雷打不动，风吹不摇！
    贫下中农管理学校，这是我们祖祖辈辈从来没有过的事。这是一场大革命，是一场激烈的阶级斗争。我们开始管理学校，就听到一些奇谈怪论。这当中有一小撮阶级敌人的恶意攻击，对这些坏蛋，要坚决回击，只准他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。也有那么一些知识分子，嘀嘀咕咕，很不服气。这不光是对贫下中农的看法，这是对毛主席革命路线的态度。一定要辩辩清楚。
    “你们贫下中农不要干涉外单位的文化大革命。”这话不对。学校不是“外单位”，学校是培养我们下一代的地方。把贫下中农的子女，培养成什么人，这是关系到我们的国家变不变颜色的大事，关系到反修防修的大事。过去十多年来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行反革命修正主义教育路线，包庇重用了一批特务、叛徒、反动文人和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。这些家伙跟着他们的黑主子，尽搞歪门邪道，什么“智育第一”，“分数挂帅”，污蔑贫下中农的子女“笨头笨脑”，千方百计把他们踢出校门。有些贫下中农的子女就是进了学校，也给教坏了。读了小学，不爱劳动，上了中学，看不起老子，进了大学，连我们这个山沟也不来了。这样的学校，是修正主义的大染缸！我们贫下中农恨透了修正主义教育路线。按照毛主席的教育路线，管理农村学校，这是贫下中农的迫切要求，是应尽的革命责任，是份内事，怎么能说是什么“干涉”呢？
    “你们农民没有知识，只会管猪牛羊，不会管数理化。”这是资产阶级知识分子放出的臭气，是颠倒黑白的谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：“什么是知识？自从有阶级的社会存在以来，世界上的知识只有两门，一门叫做生产斗争知识，一门叫做阶级斗争知识。”那些自以为了不起的知识分子，你们到底懂得多少知识？
    生产斗争知识么，有些知识分子只知道晚粳米香，不懂得晚粳稻是怎样种出来的；只知道猪牛羊肉好吃，不懂得怎样饲养，不懂得养猪牛羊同发展农业生产的辩证关系。教化学的，不懂得氨水怎样使法，教数学的，不懂得生产队的账怎么算。有批大学生到伢公社来参加劳动，竟把田塍豆当柴脑割掉了。
    阶级斗争知识么，请问那些自以为了不起的知识分子，你们真正懂得什么叫阶级压迫和阶级剥削？你们讲得出每个时期农村阶级斗争的特点和具体表现吗？恐怕讲不出。而且“一遇风浪，他们的立场，比起工人和大多数劳动农民来，就显得大不相同。前者动摇，后者坚定，前者暧昧，后者明朗。”
    今天，我们讲的知识是理论联系实际的知识。我们讲管理学校，靠的是毛泽东思想。工人阶级和我们贫下中农对毛主席的无产阶级感情最深厚，对毛泽东思想最热爱，对毛主席的革命路线执行最坚决。工人阶级和我们贫下中农一直站在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的最前列，有丰富的实践斗争知识。在工人阶级领导下，我们贫下中农就有资格也有能力管理好学校！
      “你们没办过学，行吗？”那些资产阶级知识分子对贫下中农管理学校总是信不过。你们等着瞧吧！“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”过去我们是单家独户生产，今天不是办起了集体经济了吗，而且越办越好；过去只会种单季稻，今天不是种起了双季稻吗，亩产从二百多斤提高到一千多斤；过去我们这里的十里荒岗，现在不是变成一片茶园了吗！在毛泽东思想的指引下，我们能够改变一切，创造一切！现在，有毛主席的教育方针指引，我们贫下中农也一定能把资产阶级知识分子统治的学校来个彻底改造！
    管理学校抓什么？就是认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的教育路线，狠抓阶级斗争不转向。要警惕阶级敌人和别有用心的人戴着“欢迎”的假面具，装成一副“虚心”的样子，故意把一些琐琐碎碎的事情，堆在你面前，使你陷进事务主义的圈子里，丢掉了革命大方向。我们一定要提高革命警惕性，决不能上这个当。
