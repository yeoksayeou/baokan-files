Tokyo, October 13 (New China News Agency) - Despite the suppression by the reactionary Sato government and the sabotage by the revisionist faction of the Japanese Communist Party, students from various universities in Japan are continuing their struggle bravely and tenaciously. They are fighting against the decadent educational system and opposing the use of university research for military purposes by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

For the past four months, students from various universities in Japan have been steadfastly fighting against the decadent educational system. They have engaged in numerous brave battles against the armed police sent by the Sato government and have held continuous large-scale rallies and demonstrations. Although 450 students have been arrested during these battles, the students are fearless and continue their struggle. After the Sato government rejected the students' demand for the resignation of the entire board of directors led by Koda, the students of Nihon University became even more enraged. They continue their self-defense struggle.

On October 9, 2,000 students, wearing helmets and holding daggers, gathered in front of the Economics Department. After the meeting, the students held a massive demonstration in the nearby streets.

At Tokyo University, medical students are also fighting against the reactionary "resident doctor system" and the unreasonable punishments imposed by the university authorities on students. This struggle has spread to other departments and has gained the support of a broad section of students. On October 12, with the decision by the law students to join the strike, this strike at the university has become the first school-wide strike struggle.

Students at Keio University in Tokyo are fighting against the university administration's acceptance of funds from the U.S. military for research on biological weapons. They demand that the university administration publicly admit its crimes and clearly declare both inside and outside the school that it will refuse funds from the U.S. military.

In this struggle, Keio University students have exposed the despicable plot of the "Democratic Youth League," controlled by the revisionist faction of the Japanese Communist Party led by Miyamoto, to support the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in sabotaging the student movement.

In addition, students from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Kanagawa University, Fukushima University, and other schools are also continuing their struggles. They are opposing the decadent educational system imposed on them by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and demanding the democratization of universities.
