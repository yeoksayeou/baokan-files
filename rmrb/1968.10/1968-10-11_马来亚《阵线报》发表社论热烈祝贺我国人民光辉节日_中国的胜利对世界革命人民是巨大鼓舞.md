	Malayan "Frontline News" Publishes Editorial Warmly Congratulating Our People's Glorious Holiday: China's Victory is a Great Inspiration to the Revolutionary People of the World

	New China News Agency, October 10th: Singapore News: The Malayan newspaper "Frontline News" published an editorial on the 6th titled "The Light of Beijing, the Hope of the World" to warmly congratulate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	The editorial said: "The 19 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have been extraordinary. They have been 19 years of life-and-death struggle between the Chinese proletariat under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the bourgeoisie, 19 years of fierce contention between the socialist road and the capitalist road in China, and 19 years of sharp struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev!"

	The editorial said: "Over the past 19 years, the Chinese people, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, have sailed with the east wind, waved the red flag, braved the storm, and fought the waves. In the socialist revolution and socialist construction, they have achieved extremely brilliant victories. Especially since the launch of the Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the 700 million Chinese people have taken Mao Zedong Thought as their banner, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieved new victories in the march towards the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, making socialist China more consolidated and powerful."

	The editorial said: "At present, the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, has achieved decisive victories. Revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, except Taiwan Province, achieving a red tide across the country." This great historical victory not only shattered the wild dreams of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists to restore capitalism in China, eliminating the hidden dangers in the Party and the state, but also shattered the attempts by the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionist traitors to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat in China from within, making the sinister plot to turn China into a capitalist country through 'peaceful evolution' impossible. It further guarantees that the dictatorship of the proletariat in China is as solid as a rock, further ensuring that the revolutionary fortress of socialist China is invincible."

	The editorial pointed out: "All the victories and achievements of the Chinese people are due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the result of Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat being put into practice. It has opened up a new path for the international communist movement. Revolutionary people around the world, with boundless respect, regard all the victories achieved by the Chinese people as a great inspiration and support for their own revolutionary struggles, and as a great inspiration and support for the struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples to achieve freedom and liberation."

	The editorial finally pointed out: "Today, the Chinese people are advancing bravely on the road to achieving comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionaries on all fronts, following Chairman Mao's teachings, are deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism, cleaning up class ranks, reforming education, reforming literature and art, and reforming all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base. The national economy is thriving, and great achievements have been made in national defense science and technology. We are deeply convinced that these great changes that are taking place and will take place will have an extremely profound impact on the world revolution."

    马来亚《阵线报》发表社论热烈祝贺我国人民光辉节日
    中国的胜利对世界革命人民是巨大鼓舞
    新华社十日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》六日以《北京的光芒，世界的希望》为题发表社论，热烈祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    社论说：“中华人民共和国成立后的十九年，是不平凡的十九年，是中国共产党领导下的中国无产阶级同资产阶级生死搏斗的十九年，是社会主义道路同资本主义道路在中国展开激烈的争夺战的十九年，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线进行尖锐斗争的十九年！”
    社论说：“十九年来，中国人民沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的革命航向，乘东风，展红旗，顶狂风，战恶浪，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了极其辉煌的胜利。特别是自从开展文化大革命以来，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的中国无产阶级司令部的统帅下，七亿中国人民以毛泽东思想为旗帜，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的征途中，不断取得新胜利，使社会主义中国变得更加巩固和强大。”
    社论说：“目前，中国无产阶级文化大革命，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，取得了决定性的胜利。中国全国除台湾省外的各省、市、自治区已经全部成立了革命委员会，实现了全国山河一片红。”“这一具有伟大历史性的胜利，不仅粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子在中国复辟资本主义的痴心妄想，消除了中国党和国家的隐患，同时也粉碎了以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义妄想从内部颠覆中国无产阶级专政，使中国‘和平演变’为资本主义的罪恶阴谋。它进一步保证了中国无产阶级专政坚如磐石，进一步保证了社会主义中国这一革命堡垒更加坚不可摧。”
    社论指出：“中国人民所取得的这一切胜利和成就，都应归功于毛主席的英明领导。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的学说付诸实践的结果。它为国际共产主义运动开辟了一条崭新的道路。世界各国革命人民，怀着无比崇敬的心情，把中国人民所取得的这一切胜利，看作是对自己革命斗争的巨大鼓舞和支援，看作是对各个被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取自由解放的斗争的巨大鼓舞和支援。”
    社论最后指出：“今天，中国人民正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大道上奋勇前进。各条战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，遵照毛主席的教导，在深入开展革命大批判的基础上，清理阶级队伍，改革教育，改革文艺，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。全国工农业呈现一派欣欣向荣的兴旺景象，国防科研也都取得伟大成就。我们深信，这些正在发生着和即将发生的伟大变革，必将对世界革命产生极为深远的影响。”
