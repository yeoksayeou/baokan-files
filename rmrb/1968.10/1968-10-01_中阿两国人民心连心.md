The Albanian Party of Labour, led by the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a glorious and tried-and-true Marxist-Leninist revolutionary party. The Albanian people are a heroic and great people. The Albanian people have raised high the red banner of Marxist-Leninist revolution, resolutely opposing imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and have made outstanding contributions to the world proletarian revolution.

Recently, the People's Republic of Albania solemnly announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. This bold revolutionary action has given the Soviet revisionist renegade clique another resounding slap in the face. It is a great encouragement to the struggle of the peoples of Eastern Europe against the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. All revolutionary workers of our factory express heartfelt admiration and firm support for the bold revolutionary action of the Albanian people. An old worker of our factory said: "The Albanian people are truly made of stern stuff, they are the real deal. They are our true friends and comrades. We salute the heroic Albanian people and learn from them."

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Though we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are as close as neighbors.' The friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples has withstood the storms of international class struggle and is the greatest and most precious friendship in the world. The workers of our factory have the deepest understanding of this.

In order to support the Albanian people, over the past few years, our factory has produced hundreds of items and nearly a thousand tons of industrial equipment for aid to Albania. Every piece of equipment and every part embodies the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples. Whenever our factory's production teams receive a task to produce aid for Albania, no matter how high the technical requirements or how great the processing difficulties, they all rush to take on the task. An old worker said: "When we produce aid products for Albania, it's not just about producing a piece of equipment or building a project. The most important thing is to support the socialist construction of our brother Albania, to strengthen and consolidate the fighting unity and friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples, and to add bricks and tiles to the victory of the international communist movement. Therefore, no matter how great the difficulties in production, we must take on the task and complete it."

In the process of producing aid equipment for Albania, whether it is the scorching summer or the biting cold of the third month of winter, the workers work with great enthusiasm. When the equipment is completed and passes the quality inspection, everyone wipes the sweat from their faces and shows a smile from the bottom of their hearts. As long as we can deliver high-quality equipment to our brother Albania one day earlier, no matter how much sweat we shed, we are happy from the bottom of our hearts. Every time the completed equipment leaves the factory, comrades all look at it with excited eyes and say in unison: "What is being shipped away is not just equipment, but the crystallization of the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples."

This year, we have successfully completed the production tasks for aid to Albania. In the future, we will produce more, faster, better, and more economical aid equipment for Albania. The Chinese working class will resolutely stand with the Albanian people, fight shoulder to shoulder, and advance together to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and build a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and exploitation!

    中阿两国人民心连心
    北京金属结构厂革命委员会
    以阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是光荣的、久经考验的马克思列宁主义的革命党。阿尔巴尼亚人民是英雄的、伟大的人民。阿尔巴尼亚人民高举马克思列宁主义革命红旗，坚决反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，对无产阶级世界革命作出了卓越的贡献。
    最近，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国庄严地宣布退出华沙条约。这一英勇果敢的革命行动，给了苏修叛徒集团又一个响亮的耳光。这是对东欧各国人民反对苏修叛徒集团斗争的巨大鼓舞。我厂全体革命职工对阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇果敢的革命行动，表示由衷的敬佩和坚决的支持。我厂的一位老工人说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民真是硬骨头，是好样的。他们是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致敬，向阿尔巴尼亚人民学习。”
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”中阿两国人民的友谊，是经过国际阶级斗争的急风暴雨考验的，是世界上最伟大、最珍贵的友谊。我们工厂的职工，对这一点体会得最深刻。
    为了支援阿尔巴尼亚人民，几年来，我厂制造了几百项、近千吨援阿工业设备。每一台设备、每一个零件都凝结着中阿两国人民的战斗友谊。每当我厂各生产小组接到援阿生产任务时，任凭技术要求多高、加工困难再大，都争先恐后地抢着干。一位老工人说：“我们制造援阿产品不是单纯地制造一台设备、修建一项工程，重要的是支援兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设，巩固和增强中阿两国人民战斗的团结和友谊，为国际共产主义运动的胜利添砖加瓦，所以无论生产中有天大的困难也要上，也要把任务拿下来。”
    在制造援阿设备过程中，无论是酷热的夏天，还是寒风刺骨的三九天，工人们都干得十分起劲。当设备做完最后一道工序，经检验质量优良时，每个人都抹去脸上的汗水，显出发自内心的笑容。只要能把优良的设备早一天运到兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚，不管流多少汗，我们打心眼里高兴。每当做好的设备出厂时，同志们都用兴奋的目光看着它，异口同声地说：“这运走的不只是设备，而是闪耀着中阿两国人民友谊的光辉的结晶。”
    今年我们已经胜利的完成了援阿的生产任务。今后我们还要使援阿设备的生产更多、更快、更好、更省地进行。我们中国工人阶级坚决和阿尔巴尼亚人民站在一起，为打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，并肩战斗，共同前进！
