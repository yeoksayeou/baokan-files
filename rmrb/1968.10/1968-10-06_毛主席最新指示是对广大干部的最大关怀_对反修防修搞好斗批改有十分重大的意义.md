Cadres and the masses across the nation enthusiastically acclaim Chairman Mao's latest directive, which points the way for the revolutionary transformation of organs and cadres. Cadres declare: We will surely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go among the workers and peasants, labor and fight together with them, and triumphantly complete the great historical task of struggle-criticism-transformation, forever preserving the vigorous revolutionary youth of the proletariat.

New China News Agency, October 5th: Revolutionary committees and cadres from all parts of the country, along with tens of millions of soldiers and civilians, enthusiastically acclaim the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive: "A large number of cadres should go down to the countryside to labor, this is an excellent opportunity for them to re-learn. Except for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down in batches to labor." Cadres and revolutionary masses from various places say, the editor's note in the People's Daily conveying Chairman Mao's latest directive is the greatest concern and encouragement for the cadres; it is a great strategic deployment to carry out struggle-criticism-transformation and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; it is a long-term plan for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism. They declare that they will surely implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, earnestly carry out struggle-criticism-transformation, achieve the revolutionary transformation of organs and cadres, and ensure that our proletarian iron mountain will never change color for ten thousand years!

The great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive has been conveyed, and cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers from various places have been beating drums and gongs, marching through the streets at night, and posting big-character posters with enthusiastic acclamations. Many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have held emergency meetings to earnestly study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest directive, formulate implementation plans, and resolutely carry them out; some have also held mass meetings. Today, the revolutionary committees of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City jointly held a rally with 50,000 revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses. The head of the provincial revolutionary committee and the head of the Liuhe "May 7th" Cadres School revolutionary committee spoke at the meeting. The head of the "May 7th" Cadres School revolutionary committee said, our school was established according to Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th" directive and is a large classroom for cadres to transform their worldview. The great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on cadres going down to labor is the greatest encouragement and education for us. We will surely make the "May 7th" Cadres School even better. The meeting read out the decision made by the revolutionary committees of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City, requiring that revolutionary committees at the county level and above should all have their own "May 7th" Cadres School. Those that have already been established should earnestly summarize their experiences and continuously develop and improve them, and those that have not been established should quickly set them up.

Chairman Mao has long taught: "It is necessary to insist on the system of cadres participating in collective productive labor. Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people. Through participating in collective productive labor, cadres maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism." Cadres from all parts of the country have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directive, combined with their own personal experiences, and reviewed Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, feeling particularly deeply moved and excited. Many old cadres from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places said, Chairman Mao's latest directive is the greatest care for us. At the stage of struggle-criticism-transformation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao issued this latest directive, which has great significance. We will surely carry it out resolutely. Some cadres recalled the scenes of eating, living, and laboring together with poor and lower-middle peasants during the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, and said after entering the city and sitting in the office, the conditions were different, and they did not know if they had become revisionists. The most fundamental reason is that they had left labor and the masses. They unanimously declared that they would surely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, insist on going among the workers and peasants, eat, live, and labor with them, and forever be an ordinary laborer. Cadres from the original provincial and municipal organs of Jiangxi, Shandong, and Shaanxi wrote determination letters and posted big-character posters overnight, declaring that they were ready to go to factories and rural areas at any time, participate in collective productive labor, and sincerely accept the re-education of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, walk the path of combining with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

Many members of revolutionary committees, cadres, and revolutionary masses from various regions, while studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, angrily denounced Liu Shaoqi's resistance to Chairman Mao's wise directive on cadres participating in labor and his crimes of pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power and the cadre issue, further strengthening their resolve to follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said, Chairman Mao's latest directive has once again provided us with a powerful ideological weapon for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, pointing out the path for the revolutionary transformation of organs and cadres. Cadres who have already gone down to labor in Hebei, Henan, and other places said in study and discussion sessions combined with their own feelings that leaving labor means leaving the masses and also leaving the track of Mao Zedong Thought. After going down to labor, we sweat together with the masses, and our hearts are connected. The more we labor, the deeper our feelings for the masses, and the tighter we follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. An original department-level leader from Yinchuan City, who was a shepherd before joining the revolution, entered the city after the revolutionary victory, and was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, leaving labor and the masses. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he was criticized by the masses and received great education. After studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, he was so excited that he could not sleep, feeling even more guilty for letting down Chairman Mao and the Party's cultivation. In the middle of the night, he led his family to write a determination letter in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, resolutely requesting to go down to the most arduous pastoral areas, re-learn in labor, and thoroughly reform himself. Chairman Mao's latest directive reached the revolutionary base area of Jiangxi Province, Xingguo County, where hundreds of cadres who were about to go down to labor excitedly said, Chairman Mao came to Xingguo Longgang Village and labored in the fields with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and led the village cadres to establish the system of cadres participating in labor. We will surely inherit the revolutionary tradition personally cultivated by the great leader Chairman Mao, go among the poor and lower-middle peasants, go to the arduous places, roll in the mud, temper a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and become an everlasting proletarian revolutionary fighter.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers from various regions said with great excitement that Chairman Mao's latest directive hit the hearts of us workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and soldiers. We firmly support the cadres going down to labor. Workers from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration said, we are learning Chairman Mao's latest directive and receiving Chairman Mao's education by Chairman Mao's side, which is the greatest happiness in our lives. We workers welcome the cadres who go down to labor. We will surely help them politically with enthusiasm and care for them in life, encouraging them to keep moving forward and creating good conditions for them to receive re-education. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Chairman Mao's hometown, Xiangtan County, Shaoshan People's Commune, said, we eagerly hope that the cadres will actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, go to factories and rural areas, and labor and fight together with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, triumphantly complete the great historical task of struggle-criticism-transformation, and advance vigorously on the road of ideological transformation. Many military representatives participating in various levels of revolutionary committees have been insisting on participating in labor in factories and rural areas and are regarded by the revolutionary masses as pioneers of revolutionary transformation. After studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, they are determined to further carry forward the fine traditions of the PLA, and together with the cadres, forever insist on the system of participating in collective productive labor, and forever preserve revolutionary youth.

    新华社五日讯　全国各地革命委员会成员、广大干部和亿万军民，最热烈地欢呼伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”各地革命干部和广大革命群众说，《人民日报》编者按传达的毛主席的这一最新指示，是对广大干部的最大关怀，最大鼓舞；是搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大战略部署；是反修防修的百年大计。他们表示，一定要迅速落实毛主席的最新指示，认真搞好斗、批、改，实现机关革命化和干部革命化，保证我们无产阶级铁打江山千秋万代永不变色！
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示传来，各地广大干部、革命群众和解放军指战员，敲锣打鼓，连夜上街游行，张贴热烈欢呼的大字报。许多省、市、自治区革命委员会召开紧急会议，认真学习讨论毛主席的最新指示，制定落实计划，坚决贯彻执行；有的还召开了群众大会。黑龙江省和哈尔滨市革命委员会今天联合召开了有五万名革命干部、革命知识分子、红卫兵小将和革命群众参加的誓师大会，省革命委员会负责人和柳河“五·七”干校革命委员会负责人在会上讲了话。“五·七”干校革委会负责人说，我们干校是根据毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示创办的，是干部改造世界观的大课堂。伟大领袖毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示，是对我们最大的鼓舞，最大的教育。我们一定要把“五·七”干校办得更好。大会宣读了黑龙江省和哈尔滨市革命委员会作出的决定，要求县以上的革命委员会都应当有自己的“五·七”干校，已经办的要认真总结经验，使之不断发展提高，没有办的要迅速筹办。
    毛主席早就教导说：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”全国各地广大干部反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，结合自己的切身体会重温毛主席的一贯教导，感受特别深刻，心情特别激动。北京、上海、天津等地的许多老干部说，毛主席的最新指示是对我们的最大爱护。在无产阶级文化大革命进入斗、批、改的阶段，毛主席发出这一最新指示，具有十分重大的意义，我们一定坚决贯彻执行。有的干部回忆了抗日战争和解放战争期间同贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，一起闹革命的情景以后说，进了城市，坐在办公室，条件不同，变修了还不知道，道理在哪里？最根本的一条，就是脱离了劳动，脱离了群众。他们一致表示，一定要遵照毛主席的教导，坚持到工农群众中去，同群众同吃、同住、同劳动，永远当一个普通劳动者。江西、山东、陕西等地原省市机关的广大干部连夜写决心书，贴大字报，表示随时准备好，背起行装，到厂矿去，到农村去，参加集体生产劳动，老老实实接受工人和贫下中农的再教育，走毛主席指引的与工农相结合的道路，一辈子跟毛主席闹革命。
    许多地区的革委会成员、广大干部和革命群众，在学习毛主席最新指示的时候，愤怒控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫抗拒毛主席关于干部参加劳动的英明指示，在政权建设和干部问题上推行反革命修正主义路线的罪行，更增强了紧跟毛主席无产阶级革命路线的决心。他们说，毛主席的最新指示，再一次为我们提供了反修防修的强大思想武器，指出了机关革命化、干部革命化的道路。河北、河南等地已经下放劳动的干部，在学习座谈时结合自己的感受说，脱离了劳动，就脱离了群众，也就脱离了毛泽东思想的轨道。下放劳动后，我们和群众汗流在一起，心连在一起，越劳动和群众感情越深，对毛主席的革命路线跟得越紧。银川市一个原局一级的领导干部，参加革命前是个放羊娃，革命胜利后进了城，由于受到中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的毒害，脱离了劳动，脱离了群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中受到了群众的批判，得到了很大教育。他学习了毛主席最新指示以后，激动得睡不着觉，更加感到过去对不起毛主席，辜负了党的培养。深夜，他领着一家人在毛主席像前写下决心书，坚决要求下放到最艰苦的牧区去，在劳动中重新学习，好好改造自己。毛主席最新指示传到革命老根据地江西省兴国县，正在整装待发下放劳动的数百名干部激动地说，毛主席当年一来到兴国长冈乡，就同贫下中农一起下田劳动，并带领乡干部建立起干部参加劳动的制度。我们一定要继承伟大领袖毛主席亲手培育的革命传统，到贫下中农中去，到艰苦的地方去，滚一身泥巴，炼一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，做永不褪色的无产阶级革命战士。
    各地广大工农兵群众怀着极其兴奋的心情说，毛主席的最新指示，字字说到了我们工人、贫下中农、解放军战士的心坎上，广大干部下放劳动，我们坚决拥护。来北京参加国庆观礼的二十九个省、市、自治区的工人代表们表示，我们在毛主席身边学习毛主席的最新指示，接受毛主席的教育，这是我们一生中最大的幸福。我们工人阶级对下放劳动的干部热烈欢迎。我们一定要在政治上热情帮助他们，在生活上关心他们，鼓励他们不断前进，为他们创造接受再教育的良好条件。伟大领袖毛主席家乡湘潭县韶山人民公社的贫下中农说，我们热情希望广大干部积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，到工厂、农村，和工人、贫下中农一起劳动，一起战斗，胜利完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务，在思想革命化的道路上奋勇前进。许多参加各级革命委员会的军队代表，在工厂、农村一直坚持参加劳动，被革命群众称为革命化的带头人。他们学习了毛主席的最新指示，决心进一步发扬解放军的优良传统，和广大干部一起，永远坚持参加集体生产劳动的制度，永葆革命的青春。
