Edition: 1

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented, large-scale rectification movement conducted through revolutionary methods. This rectification movement, whether in depth or breadth, in the profundity of ideological criticism or the thoroughness of organizational rectification, far surpasses any rectification since liberation. It is a great struggle by the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries, who adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to smash the revisionist cliques within the party. It is a great struggle by the broad revolutionary masses of the nation, under the call of Chairman Mao, to expose and criticize the handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the party, such as China's Khrushchev. It is a decisive battle between the two lines of upholding the proletarian dictatorship and attempting to restore capitalism. It is a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought resounding through the clouds.

The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has consolidated the proletarian dictatorship, strengthened the party's leadership, and is uniting all possible broad masses in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure in various fields to establish the comprehensive rule of the proletariat over the few bourgeois elements. The proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, has become the sole leadership center of the entire party. Now, our party is more pure, more robust, and more united.

The precious experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution tells us: the construction, rectification, and development of the party in the socialist period are inseparable from the fundamental issue of the proletarian dictatorship. Without the proletarian dictatorship and the continuous revolution under the proletarian dictatorship, there can be no correct line on the issue of party construction. The Soviet revisionist clique, starting from the so-called "whole people's state" fallacy that betrays the Marxist-Leninist theory of the proletarian dictatorship, eliminates class struggle, suppresses the laboring masses, changes the nature of the party, and turns the party founded by Lenin into a so-called "whole people's party," that is, a revisionist fascist party. The core of China's Khrushchev's black book "Self-Cultivation" is also to betray the proletarian dictatorship and scientific socialism. The "self-cultivation" he advocates aims to protect the bourgeois reactionaries who have infiltrated the party, stifle the vibrant proletarian revolutionary spirit of Communist Party members, abolish the proletarian dictatorship, and prepare a "tamed tool" for their conspiracy to restore capitalism.

Comrade Mao Zedong has upheld, defended, and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao has solved the problem of continuous revolution under the proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao pointed out that the struggle between two classes and two roads will long exist under the proletarian dictatorship, that the main danger of capitalist restoration comes from the handful of power-holders within the party who reflect the interests of the bourgeoisie, and that the proletarian dictatorship must be realized not only in the political field but also in the ideological and cultural fields. Starting from the firm belief in the absolute majority of the people, especially the absolute majority of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the first Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao let the Communist Party members join the broad revolutionary masses in the great storm of the extremely fierce and complex revolutionary mass movement to "face the wind and rain and see the world," expose the power-holders who take the capitalist road, expose counter-revolutionaries, criticize revisionism, criticize bourgeois ideology, correctly handle the masses, and experience various forms of struggle. Through this, the communist consciousness of the broad Communist Party members has been greatly promoted, the direction of continuous revolution under the proletarian dictatorship has been clarified, the bureaucratic air that corrodes revolutionary will has been dispelled, and the ties between the party and the laboring masses have been strengthened. Through this, the leftists, that is, the true proletarian revolutionaries, have been discovered and tempered, the wavering middle elements have been educated, and the rightists, that is, the bourgeois reactionaries who serve imperialism and the Kuomintang, have been isolated and exposed. Only by implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and conducting a mass, not a closed-door, rectification movement can we ensure that the leadership of party organizations at all levels is truly in the hands of Communist Party members who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only then can the party always maintain its character as the vanguard of the proletariat, lead the broad masses forward, and accomplish the glorious historical mission of the proletarian dictatorship to thoroughly eliminate the bourgeoisie (the last exploiting class in human history), eliminate class differences, and realize communism.

An issue that needs attention in the current rectification work is the absorption of fresh blood of the proletariat.

When talking about rectification, Chairman Mao once said: "A person has arteries and veins, and blood circulation is carried out through the heart. Breathing is also carried out through the lungs, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without expelling the old and taking in the new, the party will lose its vigor."

Chairman Mao's vivid analogy contains profound dialectics. Chairman Mao teaches us to regard the proletarian revolutionary party as an organization developing in the process of revolutionary metabolism, not as a stagnant, unchanging organization.

"Expelling the old" means that we must resolutely expel from the party those who are proven to be traitors, spies, all counter-revolutionaries, die-hard capitalist-roaders, class enemies, and those who have degenerated. Those who are lifeless and have weakened revolutionary will should be persuaded to leave the party.

"Absorbing fresh blood" includes two interrelated tasks: absorbing a batch of outstanding rebels, especially the advanced elements from the industrial workers, into the party, and selecting outstanding Communist Party members to participate in the leadership work of party organizations at all levels.

Through the tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a batch of rebels with proletarian consciousness have emerged among the broad revolutionary masses, especially among the laboring masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They have the following characteristics: high awareness of the two-line struggle, strong class struggle consciousness, standing on the front line of struggle, daring to stand up to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and being particularly resolute in opposing revisionism. These are very precious revolutionary qualities. They also have shortcomings, which can be educated and overcome.

A worker in Shanghai Valve Factory No. 1 who applied for party membership said: "The party organization should absorb those who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, and charge into the front lines of class struggle and production struggle. Those who apply for party membership should have the correct motivation and purpose: to rise up in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line (not for any personal purpose); after seizing power, to hold power for the proletariat (not for personal gain); to always seriously study, resolutely implement, actively propagate, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought, consciously struggle against selfishness, criticize revisionism, and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat (not to be complacent about being an 'old rebel' and not to give up halfway); to closely connect with the masses, be a student of the masses, and wholeheartedly serve the people (not to be an official or a lord, detached from the masses)."

These words are so well said! They reflect the requirements of the conscious working class for their vanguard. We should actively absorb those who meet such requirements and have the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat into the party. Those who apply for party membership should demand this of themselves, and those who have already joined the party should also demand this of themselves, and be able to withstand any future storms.

In the socialist revolutionary period, it is Chairman Mao's consistent thought to pay attention to the party's construction within the ranks of workers and to carry forward the revolutionary spirit. As early as March 1949, in the report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao proposed that in urban work, "we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class, unite other laboring masses, and win over intellectuals." In June 1950, in the report to the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee titled "Struggle for the Basic Improvement of the State's Financial and Economic Situation," Chairman Mao again explicitly proposed "to gradually absorb conscious workers into the party and expand the worker component of the party organization." In July 1957, in "The Situation in the Summer of 1957," Chairman Mao again pointed out: "Communist Party members must have vitality, must have a firm revolutionary will, must have the spirit of overcoming any difficulties with unyielding will, and must overcome individualism, localism, absolute egalitarianism, and liberalism, otherwise they are not genuine Communist Party members." In 1967, when the Cultural Revolution had achieved decisive victories, Chairman Mao again proposed: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies." The handful of class enemies who have infiltrated the party leadership, such as China's Khrushchev, are completely opposed to Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line. They do not rely on the working class but on the bourgeoisie (and bourgeois intellectuals). They do not pay attention to absorbing advanced elements of the proletariat into the party but protect traitors, labor traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries within the proletariat, and use every means to help these people infiltrate the party and seize leadership positions. They do not raise the proletarian consciousness of workers and active elements applying for party membership but instill the most decadent and dark bourgeois reactionary thoughts into them. China's Khrushchev advocates the so-called "six theories": "the theory of the extinction of class struggle," "the theory of tamed tools," "the theory of the backwardness of the masses," "the theory of joining the party to become an official," "the theory of peace within the party," and "the theory of the fusion of public and private interests" (i.e., "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage"). These are used to corrupt the workers and the party with revisionism. The core of the "six theories" is the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of tamed tools." The former denies the proletarian dictatorship and attempts to stifle the proletarian revolutionary nature of the party, making the proletarian revolutionary party degenerate. The latter denies the need for continuous revolution under the proletarian dictatorship and attempts to stifle the proletarian revolutionary nature of party members, making party members degenerate. A batch of party members stood on the wrong side in the early days of the Cultural Revolution because they were poisoned by China's Khrushchev's "six theories." We must seriously implement Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, seriously study Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution under the proletarian dictatorship, seriously study Chairman Mao's theory of the nature and tasks of the party, thoroughly eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist party-building line, and thoroughly criticize the above reactionary views. We must also seriously clean up the class ranks in the masses in all aspects, including factories, shops, people's communes, organs, schools, and streets, and root out the few counter-revolutionaries mixed among the masses, so that the absorption of new party members has a reliable ideological and organizational foundation.

To do a good job of absorbing new party members according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must also have a leadership team that firmly implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and has undergone a revolutionary three-in-one combination. We must select those who are good at applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice, who truly engage in proletarian revolution, and who have vitality to the leadership positions of the party organization, gradually forming a unified and centralized leadership.

Oppose restoration. Where the leadership team is entirely the original personnel, without absorbing the fresh blood of the proletariat, without a revolutionary three-in-one combination, or only a formal three-in-one combination rather than a revolutionary three-in-one combination, it is impossible to do a good job of developing party members. Such a leadership team cannot maintain close ties with the revolutionary masses and may absorb some "middle elements" and "good people" into the party, or even allow bad people and opportunists who are not what they seem to infiltrate, while excluding those who dare to charge into the front lines of struggle against class enemies and dare to insist on principled struggle. Where there is a tendency towards restoration, due to the lack of unity based on the principles of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, there are often two centers. The work in such places is often lifeless, superficial, stagnant, and full of the smell of "independent kingdoms." In such places, we should, through the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the mass movement, fully follow the mass line, absorb the new forces of the proletariat, overcome the "multi-center theory," and realize the revolutionization of the leadership team, gradually forming a revolutionary core that firmly implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the struggle.

There are some comrades who have made mistakes but have corrected them seriously and worked actively. They are different from those who persist in their mistakes or lie down and do nothing. They have removed their erroneous thoughts and styles, have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and have added the fresh blood of the proletariat from the revolutionary masses to their souls. We should support and unite with such cadres to work together. We should let their mistakes become a lesson for everyone to learn from.

Oppose conservatism. There are people who always find fault with everything that emerges from the revolutionary mass movement, saying this is not right and that is not right. They always use some old rules and habits to obstruct the establishment of the new revolutionary order.

Some places have conservative attitudes towards active elements applying for party membership. There are such cases: good comrades with good class backgrounds and thoughts have waited for five or six years, submitted many reports, but still cannot join the party. This phenomenon should be changed.

There is also the superstition of elections, which is another form of conservatism.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Whose power is it? It is given by the working class, by the poor and lower-middle peasants, by the broad laboring masses who make up more than 90% of the population. We represent the proletariat, represent the people, overthrow the enemies of the people, and the people support us. The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to directly rely on the broad revolutionary people." Chairman Mao's extremely important instruction deeply points out the powerful basis of the proletarian dictatorship in the masses, deeply criticizes the formalism of the superstition of elections, and points out the fundamental direction of party building and the building of revolutionary committees.

The revolutionary committee is the most representative proletarian dictatorship power organ since liberation. But the revolutionary committee is not produced by elections, but by the direct actions of the broad revolutionary masses. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, there are about 4,000 commissioners in the revolutionary committees of the 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. About half of them are representatives of the revolutionary masses, and the vast majority are representatives of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers. These 4,000 or so comrades have been tested and tempered by the revolutionary storm, and after repeated discussions, brewing, consultations, and examinations, they have been selected. Cadres must undergo the discussion, examination, and approval of the revolutionary masses and the leadership, and are constantly undergoing partial replacements and adjustments. The establishment of a revolutionary committee requires grand mass rallies of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people, with everyone rejoicing and everyone knowing about it. Ask, in the history of the party and government committees and people's representatives of various places, which session has such broad mass participation? Which session has been so widely understood by the broad revolutionary masses and so widely supervised by them? The essence of a leadership organ is determined by the line it implements and the class interests it reflects, not by the form it adopts. Democracy is class-based. Such a revolutionary power organ produced through thorough mass line in the revolutionary movement, including the new and old revolutionary cadres working in it, is more in line with proletarian democracy, more in line with democratic centralism, and can more deeply reflect the interests of the proletariat and the laboring people. Party life should also learn from this experience.

Engels said: "Revolution is undoubtedly the most authoritative thing in the world." The process of revolution is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new. The establishment of the revolutionary committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, is a declaration that all the power usurped by China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places has been taken back into the hands of the proletariat, and that they have lost all their positions in the party, government, finance, and culture. This is an objective fact that has long been in existence and is self-evident. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has long since swept China's Khrushchev, this traitor, spy, and labor traitor, into the garbage heap of history. He has long since been deprived of all his power and positions within and outside the party by the revolution.

The process of expelling the old and taking in the new in the cadre team is a process that constantly occurs with the development of the revolution. Whether a cadre always firmly stands on the proletarian revolutionary line must be tested by long-term class struggle. The same is true for the broad cadres who are now working. When new cadres join the work, be careful not to detach themselves from the laboring masses. But we should not be afraid to use cadres boldly just because we fear they might make mistakes. The laboring masses will also constantly educate and help them, and even replace them when necessary.

Expelling counter-revolutionaries and exploiting class elements from the party, absorbing outstanding rebels from the proletarian revolutionary ranks into the party, selecting vigorous Communist Party members who loyally implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to work in the leadership organs of the party at all levels, closely relying on the revolutionary masses, cadres regularly going down to participate in labor, being able to go up and down, being able to be an "official" and a "citizen," and forming a regular system, in this way, we can fully implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "expelling the old and taking in the new," and we can powerfully smash any form of counterattack and struggle of revisionism. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party—the vanguard of the Chinese proletariat—will lead the proletariat and the revolutionary people of the whole country to defeat all reactionaries at home and abroad, gradually uproot the roots of revisionism, and successfully complete the great historical mission of the proletarian dictatorship.

    吸收无产阶级的新鲜血液
    ——整党工作中的一个重要问题
    《红旗》杂志一九六八年第四期社论
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一次以革命的方法进行的空前规模的开门整党运动。这次整党运动，无论在深度或广度上，在思想批判的深刻性和组织整顿的彻底性上，都大大超过了解放以来任何一次整党。这是坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的中国无产阶级革命派粉碎党内修正主义派别的伟大斗争。这是全国最广大的革命群众在毛主席的号召下行动起来，揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫等钻进党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他反革命分子的伟大斗争。这是坚持无产阶级专政和妄图资本主义复辟的两条路线的一场决战。这是毛泽东思想的一曲响彻云霄的凯歌。
    无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，巩固了无产阶级专政，加强了党的领导，并正在上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改中团结一切可以团结的广大群众，确立无产阶级对少数资产阶级分子的全面统治。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，已经成为全党唯一的领导中心。现在，我们的党，是更加纯洁，更加坚强，更加团结了。
    无产阶级文化大革命的宝贵经验告诉我们：社会主义时期党的建设、整顿和发展，是和无产阶级专政这个根本问题分不开的。离开了无产阶级专政，离开了无产阶级专政下的继续革命，就不可能有党的建设问题上的正确路线。苏修叛徒集团正是从背叛马克思列宁主义无产阶级专政学说的所谓“全民国家”的谬论出发，抹杀阶级斗争，镇压劳动群众，改变党的性质，使列宁缔造的党变质成为所谓“全民党”即修正主义的法西斯的党。中国赫鲁晓夫黑《修养》的核心，也是背叛无产阶级专政，背叛科学社会主义。他所鼓吹的一套什么“自我修养”，其目的是保护混入党内的资产阶级反动派，扼杀共产党员生气勃勃的无产阶级革命精神，取消无产阶级专政，为他们复辟资本主义的阴谋准备“驯服工具”。
    毛泽东同志坚持了、捍卫了和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说。毛主席解决了无产阶级专政下继续革命的问题。毛主席指出了无产阶级专政下长期存在两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，指出了资本主义复辟的主要危险来自党内反映资产阶级利益的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，指出了必须不仅在政治上而且在思想文化领域中实现全面的无产阶级专政。毛主席以坚定地相信人民群众的绝大多数首先是工农兵的绝大多数为出发点，亲自发动和领导了第一次无产阶级文化大革命。毛主席让共产党员同广大革命群众在一起，在极其剧烈、极其复杂的革命群众运动的伟大风暴中“经风雨，见世面”，揭露走资本主义道路的当权派，揭露反革命分子，批判修正主义，批判资产阶级思想，正确对待群众，并且经历各种不同的斗争形式，学习正确地识别和处理无产阶级专政条件下的敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。这样，就大大促进了广大共产党员的共产主义觉悟，明确了无产阶级专政下继续革命的方向，打掉了腐蚀革命意志的官气，密切了党和劳动群众的联系。这样，就发现了和锻炼了左派即真正的无产阶级革命派，教育了动摇的中间派，孤立了和揭露了右派即为帝国主义和国民党服务的资产阶级反动派。只有执行毛主席这一条无产阶级革命路线，进行群众性的而不是关门的整党运动，才能保证各级党组织的领导权真正掌握在忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的共产党员手里，党才能始终保持自己作为无产阶级先锋队的特性，领导广大群众前进，完成无产阶级专政所赋予的彻底消灭资产阶级（人类历史上最后一个剥削阶级）、消灭阶级差别和实现共产主义的光荣历史任务。　
    当前整党工作中一个需要引起注意的问题，是吸收无产阶级新鲜血液的问题。
    毛主席在谈到整党的时候，曾经说过这样一段话：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”
    毛主席这个生动的比喻，包含着极深刻的辩证法。毛主席教育我们：要把无产阶级革命党看成在革命的新陈代谢过程中发展着的组织，不要看成凝固的、一成不变的组织。
    “清除废料”，就是必须把证据确凿的叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子、顽固不化的走资派、阶级异己分子、蜕化变质分子坚决清除出党。死气沉沉、革命意志衰退的人，则应劝其退党。
    “吸收新鲜血液”，包括两个相互联系的任务：吸收一批优秀的造反派，首先是产业工人中的先进分子入党，选拔优秀的共产党员参加各级党组织的领导工作。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，在广大革命群众中，首先在工农兵劳动群众中，已经涌现出一批具有无产阶级觉悟的造反派战士。他们有这样一个特点：两条路线斗争觉悟高，阶级斗争观念强，站在斗争第一线，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线敢于挺身而出，特别反对修正主义很坚决。这是很可宝贵的革命品质。他们也有缺点，这是可以教育和克服的。
    上海阀门一厂一位要求入党的工人同志说：“党组织应当吸收那些无限忠于毛主席，坚决贯彻无产阶级司令部战斗号令，在阶级斗争、生产斗争中冲锋陷阵的造反派战士入党。要求入党的造反派的同志，要有正确的入党动机和目的：在无产阶级文化大革命中起来造反，是为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线（不是为了达到任何个人目的）；夺权之后，要为无产阶级掌好权（不是为“私”掌权）；要始终如一地认真学习、坚决执行、积极宣传、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，自觉地斗私，批修，发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神（不能以“老造反”居功自傲，不能革命革到一半就中途而废）；要紧密联系群众，甘当群众小学生，全心全意为人民服务（不是做官当老爷，脱离群众）。”
    这段话说得多么好啊！它反映了有觉悟的工人阶级对自己先锋队的要求。应当积极地吸收符合这样要求的有无产阶级革命朝气的新鲜血液入党。要求入党的同志应当这样要求自己，已经入党的同志也应当这样要求自己，经得起今后任何大风大浪的考验。
    社会主义革命时期，重视工人队伍中党的建设，重视发扬革命朝气，是毛主席一贯的思想。早在一九四九年三月七届二中全会的报告中，毛主席就提出城市工作中“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动群众，争取知识分子”。一九五○年六月，毛主席在七届三中全会题为《为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争》的报告中，又明确提出“必须注意有步骤地吸收觉悟工人入党，扩大党的组织的工人成份。”一九五七年七月，毛主席在《一九五七年夏季的形势》中又指出：“共产党员一定要有朝气，一定要有坚强的革命意志，一定要有不怕困难和用百折不挠的意志去克服任何困难的精神，一定要克服个人主义、本位主义、绝对平均主义和自由主义，否则就不是一个名副其实的共产党员。”一九六七年，在文化大革命已取得决定性胜利的时候，毛主席又提出：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”中国赫鲁晓夫等钻进党的领导机关的一小撮阶级敌人，完全同毛主席这条无产阶级建党路线相对抗。他们不是依靠工人阶级，而是依靠资产阶级（和资产阶级知识分子）。他们不是注意吸收无产阶级的先进分子入党，而是包庇无产阶级的叛徒、工贼、特务、反革命分子，千方百计帮助这些人混入党内攫取领导职位。他们不是提高工人和要求入党的积极分子的无产阶级觉悟，而是向他们灌输最腐朽最黑暗的资产阶级反动思想。中国赫鲁晓夫推行所谓“六论”：即“阶级斗争熄灭论”“驯服工具论”“群众落后论”“入党做官论”“党内和平论”“公私溶化论”（即“吃小亏占大便宜”），就是用修正主义去腐蚀工人群众，腐蚀党。“六论”的中心是“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“驯服工具论”。前者否定无产阶级专政，妄想扼杀党的无产阶级革命性，使无产阶级革命党蜕化变质。后者否定在无产阶级专政条件下必须继续革命，妄想扼杀共产党员的无产阶级革命性，使党员蜕化变质。文化大革命初期一批党员所以一度站错了队，就是受了中国赫鲁晓夫“六论”的毒害。我们必须认真执行毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，认真学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论，认真学习毛主席关于党的性质和任务的理论，彻底清除中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义建党路线的毒害，把上述这些反动观点批透，并且在包括工厂、商店、人民公社、机关、学校、街道等各个方面的群众中认真清理好阶级队伍，把混在群众中的极少数的反革命分子挖出来，使吸收新党员有一个可靠的思想和组织基础。
    为了按照毛主席的革命路线做好吸收新党员的工作，还必须有一个坚决执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的经过更新的革命三结合的领导班子。要选拔那些活学活用毛泽东思想较好的、真正搞无产阶级革命的、有朝气的同志到党组织的领导岗位上来，逐步形成统一的一元化的领导。
    反对复旧。凡是领导班子统统是原班人马，没有吸收无产阶级的新鲜血液，没有革命三结合，或者只有形式上三结合而不是革命的三结合的地方，不可能做好发展党员的工作。这样的领导班子，不能同革命群众保持密切的联系，因而很可能吸收一些“中间派”、“老好人”入党，甚至可能被言行不一的坏人、投机分子混入，而把敢于向阶级敌人冲锋陷阵的、敢于坚持原则斗争的同志排斥在外。凡是有复旧倾向的地方，由于缺乏在毛主席革命路线原则基础上的团结，常常形成两个中心。这种地方工作往往死气沉沉，华而不实，滞而不进，“独立王国”气味甚浓。在这些地方，应当通过斗、批、改的群众运动，充分走群众路线，吸收无产阶级的新生力量，克服“多中心论”，实现领导班子革命化，在斗争中逐步形成一个坚决执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的革命核心。
    有一些犯过错误而又认真改正了错误、积极工作的同志，他们与那些坚持错误或躺倒不干的人不同。他们去掉了错误的思想和作风，对毛主席的革命路线有了比较深刻的认识。他们灵魂中增加了来自革命群众的无产阶级的新鲜血液。应当支持和团结这样的干部共同工作。应当把他们犯过的错误成为人们共同记取的教训。
    反对保守主义。有这样一种人，对于从革命群众运动中产生的新事物，总是百般挑剔，这也不行，那也不行。他们总要用某种成规旧习来阻碍革命新秩序的建立。
    有的地方对要求入党的积极分子存在保守思想。有这样的情况：成份、思想都不错的好同志，等了五、六年，打了多次报告，仍然不得入党。这种现象应当改变。
    迷信选举，这也是一种保守思想。
    毛主席最近指出：“我们的权力是谁给的？是工人阶级给的，是贫下中农给的，是占人口百分之九十以上的广大劳动群众给的。我们代表了无产阶级，代表了人民群众，打倒了人民的敌人，人民就拥护我们。共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”毛主席这个极端重要的指示，深刻地指出了无产阶级专政强大威力的群众基础，深刻地批判了迷信选举的形式主义，指出了党的建设和革命委员会建设的根本方向。
    革命委员会是解放以来最具有革命代表性的无产阶级专政的权力机构。但革命委员会就不是选举产生的，而是直接依靠广大革命群众的行动产生的。在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下的全国二十九个省、市、自治区的革命委员会中，有四千名左右的委员，其中大约半数左右是革命群众的代表，绝大多数是革命的工农兵的代表。这四千左右的同志，是经过了革命风暴的考验和锤炼，再经历了反复的争论、酝酿、协商、审查，才推选出来的。干部要经过革命群众的讨论、审查和领导的批准，而且经常进行着局部的撤换和调整。一个革命委员会的成立，要开十几万人以至几十万人隆重的群众大会，万众欢腾，家喻户晓。请问各地历届的党、政委员会和人民代表，哪一届有这样广泛的群众性呢？有哪一届这样广泛地得到了广大革命群众的了解，又这样广泛地受到广大革命群众的监督呢？决定领导机构本质的是执行什么路线，反映什么阶级的利益，而不是采取什么形式。民主是有阶级性的。这种在革命运动中经过彻底的群众路线产生的革命权力机构，包括在其中工作的各方面的新、老革命干部，比以前单纯用选举产生的更合于无产阶级民主，更合于民主集中制，更能深刻得多地反映无产阶级和劳动人民的利益。党的生活中，也应当吸取这个经验。
    恩格斯说过：“革命无疑是天下最有权威的东西。”革命的过程就是吐故纳新的过程。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下的各省、市、自治区革命委员会的建立，就是宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人所窃取的一切权力夺回到无产阶级手中，就是宣告了他们失去了党、政、财、文的一切职位，这是不言而喻的早已客观存在的事实。无产阶级文化大革命早已把中国赫鲁晓夫这个叛徒、内奸、工贼扫进历史的垃圾堆去了。他早已被革命剥夺了党内外的一切权力和职位了。
    革命干部队伍的吐故纳新，是一种随着革命不断发展经常发生的过程。一个干部是否始终坚定地站在无产阶级革命路线上，要经过长期阶级斗争的考验。现在参加工作的广大的干部也是这样。新干部参加工作，千万注意不要脱离劳动群众。但我们不要因为怕干部犯错误而不敢大胆使用。劳动群众把他们提上领导岗位，同样地会不断地教育和帮助他们，以至在必要时撤换他们。
    清除反革命分子和剥削阶级分子出党，吸收无产阶级革命造反派中的优秀分子入党，把忠实地执行毛主席革命路线的朝气蓬勃的共产党员挑选到各级党的领导机构中去工作，紧紧依靠革命群众，干部定期下放参加劳动，能上能下，能“官”能“民”，并且形成经常制度，这样，我们就能全面地执行毛主席“吐故纳新”的指示，就能有力地粉碎修正主义任何形式的反扑和挣扎。在伟大领袖毛泽东同志领导下的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党——中国无产阶级的先锋队，将更加生龙活虎地领导无产阶级和全国革命人民战胜国内外的一切反动派，逐步挖掉修正主义根子，胜利地完成无产阶级专政的伟大历史使命。
