	The statement said: "The great victories of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction are the victories of Marxism-Leninism, the victories of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism combined with the concrete practice of China, the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The historic victories achieved by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao clearly show that no force in the world can stop the people struggling for national liberation and freedom from advancing."

	The statement concluded with the slogans: "Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the people of South West Africa! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times!"

	Bobby Marks, a member of the National Executive Committee of the Botswana People's Party, recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "We warmly hail the achievements made by China in the fields of science and technology and socialist construction over the past nineteen years. New China has broken the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail of U.S. imperialism. This is a great encouragement to the world's revolutionary people in their struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism and for national liberation. We hail the clear and consistent stand of the People's Republic of China in supporting national liberation movements all over the world. We are firmly convinced that with the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, China will open up a new chapter in the revolutionary process of our common struggle against imperialism and all its running dogs and accomplices."

	Marks concluded with the slogans: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

	The Tanzanian newspaper *The Nationalist* published an article titled "The Chinese Revolution," which said: "With such a powerful China participating in the worldwide anti-imperialist struggle, the future is full of hope." The article said: "Nineteen years ago, a historic event that shook the world occurred—the founding of the People's Republic of China."

	The article emphasized: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought the Chinese revolution into a new historical period. The enthusiasm for the masses aroused by the cultural revolution has produced unprecedented industrial and agricultural innovations across the country, resulting in an unprecedented increase in national wealth."

	The Mali Press Agency published an article stating that over the past nineteen years, the Chinese people, with their creative genius and tireless labor spirit, have turned the People's Republic of China into a prosperous and flourishing country with a bright future.

	Nagwa Makawi, a member of the South Yemen Women's Union, recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "We sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on their great victories and the great achievements they have made in the past nineteen years. We congratulate the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, on advancing from one victory to an even greater victory."
