The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Dongfanghong Shipyard, under the assistance of the PLA's East Sea Fleet's leftist support personnel, has fully exerted the leading role of the working class in the enterprise. Relying on the masses of workers, they have carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation (dou, pi, gai) in the departments, thoroughly and universally reforming all unreasonable regulations and institutions that do not adapt to the socialist economic base. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory is excellent.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, October 28th - Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "the working class must lead everything," and with the assistance of the PLA's East Sea Fleet's leftist support personnel, the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Dongfanghong Shipyard has fully exerted the leading role of the working class in the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement. They have mobilized the masses of workers to participate in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the departments, thoroughly and universally reforming all unreasonable regulations and institutions that do not adapt to the socialist economic base. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory is excellent.

	Organizing worker investigation teams to rely on the masses of workers for the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the departments

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Dongfanghong Shipyard, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the entire factory launched a struggle, criticism, and transformation movement with the working class as the main force. Soon, a sharp problem was presented to the Revolutionary Committee and the leftist support personnel: the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the various departments of the factory lagged far behind the workshops and teams, and did not adapt to the rapidly developing revolutionary and production situation. This contradiction became increasingly prominent. What was the root cause of the problem?

	At this time, the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao were transmitted: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." With the assistance of the leftist support personnel, the Revolutionary Committee used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to seriously analyze the problems existing in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the various departments. Everyone deeply realized that although the Revolutionary Committee had been established, the working class had seized the leadership of the factory from a small handful of capitalist roaders. However, this did not mean that the working class had completely seized the leadership of all departments and links of the factory's superstructure, especially in some departments directly organizing, commanding, and managing production, where the monopoly of intellectuals had not been thoroughly broken. If these departments relied on the original personnel to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, they would not be able to struggle well, criticize thoroughly, or transform thoroughly. They must have the participation of the masses of workers to carry it out well. In this regard, the road taken by the Inspection Department has had the deepest educational impact on everyone.

	The original Inspection Department was the department with the highest level of equipment and the most concentrated intellectuals in the entire factory. The factory's capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" vigorously promoted the revisionist enterprise line of the Chinese Khrushchev, copying the Soviet revisionists' methods, increasing the personnel to over a hundred, and even specially building an inspection building, pursuing "big, foreign, and complete," completely detached from proletarian politics, production practice, and the masses of workers. The workers angrily said: "This is a breeding ground for revisionist germs." At the beginning, the Revolutionary Committee also wanted to rely on their own strength to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, but the result was that they could not criticize the bourgeois technical "authorities" thoroughly, could not uncover the lid of class struggle, and could not implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. No matter how many times they transformed, a department of over a hundred people was not reduced by one person. The masses of workers had long been dissatisfied with the bad style of intellectuals who "talk big but do not match their actions." The backward appearance of this department could no longer be allowed to continue. Therefore, seven old workers from the Forging Workshop voluntarily organized themselves and went to the Inspection Department to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, investigating the history and current situation of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in this department. These seven "rough-handed" workers, relying on the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, broke through the monopoly of intellectuals in that place, uncovered the lid of class struggle, quickly united and educated the majority of the masses, and launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	The latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao made the leftist support personnel and the Revolutionary Committee deeply realize the great significance of this new thing. They enthusiastically supported the revolutionary actions of the seven workers and promoted their experience throughout the factory. Immediately, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, more than a hundred investigation teams were organized from various workshops and teams, marching into the departments that were closely related to and matched their business. Thus, a great mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation in all fields of the factory's superstructure, led by the working class and participated in by the masses of workers, vigorously arose in Dongfanghong Shipyard.

	Fiercely criticizing the fallacies of bourgeois technical "authorities," ensuring that the leadership of all fields of the superstructure is firmly in the hands of the working class in terms of ideology and organization

The great revolutionary initiative of workers entering departments to participate in and lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses. At the same time, it also faced fierce resistance from the capitalist old forces. Those bourgeois technical "authorities" spread malicious rumors, stirring up trouble, and spreading the reactionary fallacy that "workers do not understand the business of the superstructure," vigorously resisting the leadership of the working class.

	The leftist support personnel and the Revolutionary Committee, together with the masses of workers, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Chairman Mao's great thought of "the working class must lead everything" to arm the workers, and launched a head-on struggle against the bourgeois technical "authorities" and old forces. The workers, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, said: "Chairman Mao trusts us and gives us the great power to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all fields of the superstructure. This power we workers must firmly grasp. With Chairman Mao backing us and the great thought of Mao Zedong, we can completely lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all fields of the superstructure."

	The Welding Experiment Room is an important department in the shipyard with complex technology. After the welding workers entered this "independent kingdom" that had been ruled by bourgeois technical "authorities," some people spread the word: "Now they are welcomed with drums and gongs, but soon they will have to be welcomed out with drums and gongs." Some bourgeois technical "authorities" simply crossed their arms, waiting to see the joke. Facing the provocation of class enemies and the stubborn resistance of old habits, the workers firmly stated: "We must fight for Chairman Mao! No matter how great the difficulties, we must seize the leadership power." There was an advanced technology called electromagnetic platform single-sided welding and double-sided forming, which was very needed in production. However, under the control of the bourgeois technical "authorities" in this experiment room, a large amount of state funds had been spent, and after more than two years, this advanced technology had not yet come out of the experiment room.

	Under the support of the Revolutionary Committee, the worker comrades themselves led the experiment of this new technology. They firmly implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, emphasized proletarian politics, grasped class struggle, relied on the activists in that place who were determined to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, united and led the majority of the masses, learned and worked together, pooled their wisdom, and relied on the wisdom and strength given by Mao Zedong thought to overcome numerous difficulties and successfully experimented in just two weeks. This good news quickly spread throughout the factory, greatly boosting the morale of the working class and greatly dampening the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. Many workers, with tears of excitement, shouted over and over again: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

	The leftist support personnel and the Revolutionary Committee seized this living example, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, using the capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" as living materials, mobilizing the masses to fiercely criticize and expose the revisionist enterprise line and the fallacy that "workers do not understand the business of the superstructure," thoroughly exposing the lid of class struggle, further digging out the hidden class enemies who sabotage the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They also took organizational measures, selecting some outstanding workers to strengthen the core leadership of the departments; transferring some outstanding technical workers with practical experience to strengthen the departments, fundamentally changing the situation where intellectuals were piled up there. In terms of production and technical management, from the workshop to the factory, they universally established and improved the technical management network of workshop workers, revolutionary cadres, and technical personnel working together in three combinations. Thus, they ensured that the leadership power of all fields of the factory's superstructure was truly in the hands of the working class who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, both ideologically and organizationally, making the great mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation sweep away the muddy water in all fields of the superstructure with even greater momentum.

	With full enthusiasm, re-educating technical personnel, fully exerting their role in the struggle, criticism, and transformation

After the workers entered the departments, the main objects they came into contact with were intellectuals cultivated from old schools. The leftist support personnel and the Revolutionary Committee, together with the masses of workers, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Students trained in old schools, the majority or a large majority can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must give them re-education to thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." They studied Chairman Mao's various proletarian policies towards intellectuals, making everyone clear that the working class leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all fields of the superstructure must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, enthusiastically re-educating intellectuals, mobilizing all positive factors, uniting the majority of the masses, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions.

	Almost all the personnel in the technical department of this factory were intellectuals cultivated from old schools. Some people could not clearly distinguish themselves from the revisionist line of "experts managing the factory"; some people even shed tears for the removal of their own design table used for closed-door design. The masses of workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, patiently re-educated them and jointly carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism. The masses of workers used their own experiences of class suffering and deep hatred of the persecution by the revisionist enterprise line of the Chinese Khrushchev to awaken their class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness, arousing their hatred for the revisionist enterprise line of the Chinese Khrushchev. The workers angrily exposed and denounced a small handful of capitalist roaders in the factory, who betrayed and framed spies as "experts" and "authorities," handing over the management power of the enterprise to them, and practicing bourgeois dictatorship over the working class. The masses of workers' strong hatred for the revisionist enterprise line of the Chinese Khrushchev deeply educated the technical personnel. A technician, using his personal experience, denounced that "experts managing the factory" not only destroyed the socialist enterprise but also poisoned the younger generation in the scientific and technological team. When he first came to the department, he often went to the workshop to work and discussed problems with the foremen. However, the capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" criticized him for "not doing his job" and not following the "labor discipline." Over time, he also became accustomed to the life of "a desk and a cup of tea, only wanting to be an expert." Under the education and help of the worker comrades, he painfully said: "In the past, we ate the food and wore the clothes of workers and peasants, but under the poisoning of the revisionist line, we did stupid things that dragged socialism down. This time, the worker comrades rescued us from the revisionist quagmire, we must respectfully accept the re-education of the working class and, under the leadership of the working class, work with the worker comrades to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation well."

	The more they criticized, the more they denounced, the more deeply they realized that the departments under the rule of the revisionist line were purely serving bourgeois dictatorship and serving the capitalist roaders to be officials and lords, and must be thoroughly reformed. Recently, the technical department accepted a ship design modification task. According to the routine, technical personnel only needed to follow the modification plan of the design institute, close the door, and draw the construction drawings. This time, with the help of the worker comrades, the technical personnel broke through the numerous obstacles set by the revisionist scientific and technological line, firmly demanding to "go downstairs and out of the courtyard," bringing the drawings to the workshops and teams to "settle down." The worker comrades supported their revolutionary actions, reminding them of Chairman Mao's great teachings on the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants, encouraging them to take the process of modifying the design as an excellent opportunity to accept the re-education of the working class. After the technical personnel went down to the workshop, they respectfully regarded the workers as their teachers, actively learning and using Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the worker comrades, working together, and modifying the design together. As a result, they completed the task, which would have taken at least half a year according to the routine, in just over two weeks.

	The comrades in the technical department took a gratifying step in the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The factory Revolutionary Committee and the leftist support personnel praised them and encouraged them to continue advancing on the revolutionary road indicated by Chairman Mao. In this way, the enthusiasm of the technical personnel was mobilized, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in other departments were promoted.

    上海东方红造船厂革委会充分发挥工人阶级在企业中的领导作用
    依靠工人群众搞好科室的斗批改
    在解放军支左人员帮助下，工人群众和革命技术人员狠批了修正主义办企业路线，对不合理的规章制度，对一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，进行了彻底的、普遍的改革，全厂革命和生产形势一派大好
    新华社上海二十八日电　上海东方红造船厂革委会在人民解放军东海舰队驻厂支左人员的帮助下，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大教导，在斗、批、改的群众运动中，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，放手发动工人群众参加科室的斗、批、改，对不合理的规章制度，对一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，实行彻底的、普遍的改革，全厂革命和生产形势一派大好。
    组织工人调查组，依靠工人群众进行科室的斗、批、改
    东方红造船厂革委会成立后，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，全厂掀起了以工人阶级为主力军的斗、批、改的群众运动。不久，一个尖锐的问题摆在革委会和支左人员面前：工厂各科室的斗、批、改，远远落在车间班组的后面，而且与飞跃发展着的革命和生产的新形势不相适应，这个矛盾越来越突出。问题的症结究竟在哪里？
    就在这时候，传来了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”革委会在支左人员的帮助下，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，认真分析了各科室在斗、批、改中存在的问题。大家深刻认识到，革委会成立了，工人阶级从一小撮走资派手中夺回了工厂的领导大权。但是，这并不等于工人阶级完全掌握了工厂上层建筑各个工作部门、各个环节上的领导大权，特别是在一些直接组织指挥、管理生产的技术业务部门，那里知识分子独霸的一统天下并没有彻底冲破。这些部门如果靠原班人马搞斗、批、改，是斗不好，批不透，改不彻底的，必须有工人群众参加才能搞好。这方面，检验科所走过的道路，对大家教育最深。
    原检验科，是全厂设备最高级、知识分子最集中的科室。厂里走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”，拚命推行中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义企业路线，照搬苏修一套，人员增至上百人，还专门造了检验大楼，追求“大、洋、全”，完全脱离无产阶级政治，脱离生产实践，脱离工人群众。工人们气愤地说：“这里是生长修正主义毒菌的温床。”开始，革委会也想依靠他们自己的力量搞斗、批、改，结果是对资产阶级技术“权威”批不臭，阶级斗争盖子揭不开，毛主席最新指示落实不了。改来改去，一个上百人的科一个人也没有精简。工人群众对知识分子这种“嘴上讲的呱呱叫，思想行动不对号”的坏作风，早就看不惯，这个科的落后面貌再也不能让它继续下去了。于是，铸锻车间的七位老工人，自动组织起来，到检验科去宣传毛主席的最新指示，调查这个科阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的历史和现状。这七位“粗手粗脚”的工人，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，硬是打破了那里知识分子独霸的一统天下，揭开了阶级斗争的盖子，迅速地团结和教育了大多数群众，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，使支左人员和革委会深刻地认识到这个新鲜事物的伟大意义。他们满腔热情地支持七位工人的革命行动，向全厂推广了他们的经验。紧接着，在革委会的领导下，各车间、班组又组成了一百多个调查小组，浩浩荡荡地开进同自己联系密切、业务对口的科室。于是，一个有工人阶级领导、有工人群众参加的工厂上层建筑各领域的斗、批、改的伟大群众运动，在东方红造船厂蓬蓬勃勃地兴起来了。
    狠批资产阶级技术“权威”的谬论，从思想上、组织上保证上层建筑各个领域的领导权牢牢掌握在工人阶级手中
    工人群众开进科室参加并领导斗、批、改，这个伟大的革命创举，受到了革命群众的热烈欢迎。同时，也遭到了资本主义旧势力的疯狂抵抗。那些资产阶级技术“权威”煽阴风，点邪火，散布“工人不懂上层建筑领域的业务”的反动谬论，极力抵制工人阶级的领导。
    支左人员和革委会同工人群众一起，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，用毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大思想武装工人群众，向资产阶级技术“权威”和旧势力展开了针锋相对的斗争。工人们满怀革命豪情地说：“毛主席信任我们，把领导上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的大权交给了我们，这个权我们工人阶级一定要牢牢地掌握住。有毛主席给我们撑腰，有伟大的毛泽东思想，我们完全能够领导上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改。”
    焊接试验室是造船厂一个技术复杂的重要部门。当焊接工人开进这个过去被资产阶级技术“权威”统治的“独立王国”后，有的人就放出风：“现在敲锣打鼓把他们欢迎进来，要不了多久，还得敲锣打鼓‘请出去’。”有的资产阶级技术“权威”干脆把两手一叉，等着看笑话。面对阶级敌人的挑衅和旧习惯势力的顽固抵抗，工人们坚决表示：“我们一定要为毛主席争气！不管困难多大，也要把领导大权掌握起来。”有一项先进技术，叫电磁平台单面焊双面成型，生产上非常需要，可是在这个实验室的资产阶级技术“权威”把持下，花费了国家大量资金，搞了两年多，这项先进技术仍没有出实验室。
    工人同志在革委会的支持下，自己领导这项新技术的试验。他们坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，依靠那里决心把文化大革命进行到底的积极分子，去团结和带领群众的大多数，边干边学，群策群力，靠毛泽东思想给予的智慧和力量，终于战胜了重重困难，只用了两周的时间，就试验成功了。这个喜讯，迅速传遍了全厂，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。许多工人群众噙着激动的热泪，一遍又一遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    驻厂支左人员和革委会抓住这个活教材，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，把走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”当活材料，发动群众狠揭狠批修正主义企业路线和“工人不懂上层建筑领域的业务”的谬论，大揭阶级斗争盖子，进一步深挖隐藏的破坏斗、批、改的阶级敌人。并从组织上采取措施，选派一些优秀工人去加强科室的核心领导；抽调有实践经验的优秀技术工人充实科室，从根本上改变那里知识分子成堆的状况。在生产技术管理方面，从车间到厂，普遍建立和健全起有工人参加领导的车间工人、革命干部和技术人员三结合的技术管理网。从而，从思想上、组织上保证了工厂上层建筑各领域的领导大权真正掌握在无限忠于毛主席革命路线的工人阶级手中，使斗、批、改的伟大群众运动，以更加磅礴的气势荡涤着上层建筑各领域内的污泥浊水。
    满腔热情地对技术人员进行再教育，充分发挥他们在斗、批、改中的作用
    工人群众开进科室后，接触的主要对象是从旧学校培养出来的知识分子。支左人员和革委会同工人群众一起，反复学习了毛主席的教导：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”学习了毛主席制定的对知识分子的各项无产阶级政策。使大家明确了：工人阶级领导上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改，一定要遵照毛主席的教导，满腔热情地对知识分子进行再教育，调动一切积极因素，团结群众的大多数，坚决落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。
    这个厂的技术科，几乎全是从旧学校培养出来的知识分子。有的人同“专家治厂”的修正主义路线划不清界线；有的人竟为拆掉了自己闭门搞设计的设计台流下了眼泪。工人群众遵照毛主席的教导，耐心地对他们进行再教育，和他们一起深入开展革命大批判。工人群众用自己受过的阶级苦、受中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义企业路线迫害的深仇大恨，去启发他们的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，激发他们对中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义企业路线的仇恨。工人们愤怒地揭发、控诉了厂内一小撮走资派，把叛徒、特务封为“专家”、“权威”，把企业的各项管理大权交给他们，对工人阶级实行资产阶级专政的滔天罪行。工人群众对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义企业路线的强烈仇恨，深深地教育了技术人员。一位技术员，用自己亲身经历，控诉了“专家治厂”不仅毁坏了社会主义企业，同时也毒害了科技队伍中的年青一代。他刚来科室时，还常到车间劳动，同老师傅商量问题。可是，走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”斥责他“不务正业”、不遵守“劳动纪律”。久而久之，他也习惯了“一张图桌一杯茶，一心只想当专家”的生活。在工人同志的教育帮助下，他沉痛地说：“过去我们吃着工农兵的饭，穿着工农兵的衣，但是在反革命修正主义路线毒害下，我们却干了拖社会主义后腿的蠢事。这次工人同志把我们从修正主义的泥坑里解救出来，我们一定要恭恭敬敬地接受工人阶级的再教育，在工人阶级领导下，同工人同志一起搞好斗、批、改。”
    大家越批判越控诉，越深刻地认识到，修正主义路线统治下的科室，纯粹是为资产阶级专政服务的，是为走资派做官当老爷服务的，非彻底改革不可。不久前，技术科接受了一条船的设计修改任务。按常规，技术人员只要根据设计院的修改方案，关起门来搞施工图就可以了。这次，在工人同志帮助下，技术人员冲破修正主义科技路线设置的重重障碍，坚决要求“下楼出院”，带上图纸，到车间、班组“安家落户”。工人同志支持他们的革命行动，同他们一起重温了毛主席关于知识分子必须同工农群众相结合的伟大教导，勉励他们把修改设计的过程，作为接受工人阶级再教育的极好机会。技术人员下到车间后，恭恭敬敬拜工人为师，同工人同志一起活学活用毛主席最新指示，一起劳动，一起修改设计。结果，把过去至少要半年才能完成的任务，只用了两个多星期就圆满地完成了。
    技术科的同志在斗、批、改的高潮中，迈出了可喜的一步。厂革委会和支左人员表扬了他们，并鼓励他们沿着毛主席指引的革命化的道路继续前进。这样，调动了技术人员的积极因素，推动了其他各科室的斗、批、改。
