The famine in India is severe, with starving people throughout the country, and tens of millions of peasants struggling on the brink of death. The situation is extremely miserable. Why can't the Indian ruling class solve the problem of food for its people? What is the fundamental reason?

Is it because the population is too large? The imperialists and reactionaries have always used the excuse that if the population is too large, there won't be enough food to eat. According to this reactionary logic, countries with large populations are doomed, with no hope. Didn't the American imperialist Acheson also say that China's large population is an "unbearable burden"? But once the Chinese revolution succeeded, under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, a tremendous socialist revolution and construction were carried out, and in a short period of time, the problem of eating was solved, and the people's lives are getting better and better. The facts in China are a powerful refutation of the above counter-revolutionary propaganda.

Is it due to unfavorable weather conditions? Currently, some states in India are experiencing droughts, while others are suffering from severe floods. However, this is not the fundamental reason why the Indian people have no food to eat. Natural disasters are difficult to completely avoid in any country. In fact, if we talk about the natural conditions for developing agriculture, India is blessed. India has no severe winters all year round, abundant rainfall, and fertile land. As long as the people are in charge and under the leadership of a genuine revolutionary party and revolutionary line, even if the population increases many times, there will definitely be a way. This method is revolution plus production.

India, which was originally a "granary," now faces a worsening food problem. This is entirely the result of the ruthless and merciless oppression, exploitation, and plunder by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

The Indian reactionaries have mainly relied on begging from American imperialism to survive, and they have become accustomed to holding out their hands. However, even begging is not so easy anymore. Recently, India's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Desai went to the United States to beg for food and returned empty-handed. The reason is that the American "landlord" is also in economic and financial crisis, and life is getting worse. For a country like India with hundreds of millions of people to rely on the scraps from imperialism to survive, this is truly a dead end. This incident not only deeply reflects the decline, decay, and inevitable trend of total collapse of the entire capitalist old world but also foreshadows that India and the entire old world will inevitably face new and larger-scale revolutionary storms.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao pointed out: "We believe that revolution can change everything"; "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." This is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. The great and hardworking people of India, as long as they overthrow the rule of the landlord and bourgeoisie and truly take control of their own destiny, will definitely be able to rely on their own strength to gradually build a prosperous and thriving new India.

    只有革命才能解决吃饭问题
    印度粮荒严重，饥民遍及全国，几千万农民在死亡线上挣扎，境况十分悲惨。印度统治集团解决不了它国内人民的吃饭问题，其根本原因在哪里呢？
    是因为人口太多吗？人口太多了，粮食就不够吃了，这是帝国主义和反动派一贯的欺骗宣传。按照反动派的这一逻辑，人口多的国家都是死路一条，毫无希望的。美帝国主义者艾奇逊不是也说过中国人口多是一种“不堪负担的压力”吗？可是，中国革命一旦胜利，在毛泽东思想的阳光普照下，进行了惊天动地的社会主义革命和建设，在短短的时期内，就解决了吃饭问题，而且人民的生活越来越好。中国的事实，是对上述反革命宣传的有力驳斥。
    是由于风不调雨不顺吗？目前，印度有一些邦干旱，另有一些邦发生严重水灾。但是，这也不是印度人民没有饭吃的根本原因。天灾，这在任何国家都是难于完全避免的。实际上，要讲发展农业的自然条件，印度是得天独厚的。印度一年四季没有严冬，雨量充足，土地肥沃，只要人民当家作了主，只要在真正的革命党和革命路线的领导下，即使再增加多少人口也是完全有办法的。这个办法就是革命加生产。
    印度这样一个本来是“粮仓”的国家，现在吃饭问题越来越严重，完全是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行残酷无情的压迫、剥削和榨取的结果。
    印度反动派，过去主要是向美帝国主义乞讨过活、伸手伸惯了的。但是，叫花子也不那么好当了，最近，印度副总理兼财政部长德赛到美国讨饭碰壁，灰溜溜地回来了。原因是美国“财主”自身陷入了经济和金融危机，日子也越来越不好过。印度这样一个几亿人口的大国，靠帝国主义施舍点残羹剩饭过活，这才真正是一条死路。这件事，不仅深刻地反映了整个资本主义旧世界的衰落、腐朽和走向总崩溃的必然趋势，也预示着印度和整个旧世界不可避免地将要爆发新的更大规模的革命风暴。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席指出：“我们相信革命能改变一切”；“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”这是一条马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。伟大的勤劳的印度人民，只要推翻了地主资产阶级的统治，真正掌握了自己的命运，就一定能够依靠自己的力量，逐步地创建一个繁荣昌盛的新印度来。
