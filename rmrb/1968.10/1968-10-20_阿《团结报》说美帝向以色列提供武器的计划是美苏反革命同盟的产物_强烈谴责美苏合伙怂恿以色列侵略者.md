The Albanian "Unity" newspaper published a commentary on October 18, strongly condemning the collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism in continuing to instigate and support the Israeli aggressors.

The commentary pointed out that the other day, U.S. President Johnson announced that the United States would continue to provide Israel with American fighter-bombers for expanding its aggression against the Arab people. This once again exposed the U.S. as the main supporter and instigator of the Israeli aggressors.

The commentary said that the U.S. government's so-called "political solution" to the Middle East issue is actually to ensure that the Israeli aggressors can prolong their rule over the lands they have occupied. The Arab people are increasingly recognizing the true intentions behind this action by U.S. imperialism. Now, the imperialist wolves have decided to openly provide more weapons to the Israeli lackeys, which makes the Arab people see even more clearly the true face of U.S. imperialism.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' plan to continue providing weapons to Israel was announced after Rask and Gromyko had a friendly talk at the United Nations. This is not a coincidence. It shows that this new plan is also a product of the U.S.-Soviet counterrevolutionary alliance. The traitorous Soviet revisionists, using the same language as the imperialists, have long since clearly shown their great betrayal of the cause of the Arab peoples. They are also doing everything they can to pressure and force Arab countries to sit down with the Israeli aggressors, attempting to make the Arab people recognize Israel as a state.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Palestinian patriots are striking heavy blows against the aggressors through their struggle. The Palestine Liberation Front recently expressed in a statement their determination to carry the war of liberation to the end. The statement emphasized that the path of guerrilla warfare is the only way for the Palestinian people and the Arab people to liberate their occupied homeland. The commentary said that this is the only correct and firm stance, which defends the interests of the peoples of the Arab countries.

    阿《团结报》说美帝向以色列提供武器的计划是美苏反革命同盟的产物
    强烈谴责美苏合伙怂恿以色列侵略者
    新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十八日发表短评，强烈谴责美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义勾结继续唆使和支持以色列侵略者。
    短评指出，前几天，美帝头子约翰逊宣布将继续向以色列提供用于扩大对阿拉伯人民的侵略的美国战斗轰炸机。这再次暴露美帝是以色列侵略者的主要支持者和唆使者。
    短评说，美国政府的所谓对中东问题的“政治解决”，实际上是保证以色列侵略者能够延长对他们所侵占的土地的统治。阿拉伯人民正在愈来愈清楚地认识到美帝国主义这一行动的真正企图。现在，帝国主义豺狼们决定重新明目张胆地向以色列走狗提供其它武器，这更加使得阿拉伯人民看清了美帝国主义的真面目。
    短评指出，美帝国主义继续向以色列提供武器的计划在腊斯克同葛罗米柯在联合国亲切会谈以后宣布，这并不是偶然的。这说明，这一新计划也是苏美反革命同盟的产物。苏修叛徒们用同帝国主义者一样的语言提出的为了中东的“平静与和平”的建议，早就清楚地证明了他们对阿拉伯各国人民的事业的大叛卖。他们还千方百计地压服和强迫阿拉伯国家同以色列侵略者坐到一起，企图以此使阿拉伯人民承认以色列是一个国家。
    短评最后说，巴勒斯坦爱国者正在以他们的斗争给侵略者以沉重的打击。巴勒斯坦解放阵线最近在一项声明中表达了他们把解放战争进行到底的决心。这项声明强调说：游击战争的道路，是巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民争取解放被侵占的家园的唯一道路。短评说，这是唯一正确的坚定的立场，这个立场捍卫了阿拉伯各国人民的利益。
