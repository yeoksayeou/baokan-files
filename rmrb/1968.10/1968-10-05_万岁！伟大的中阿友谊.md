We are the crew of the "International" ship of the China-Albania Shipping Company. For years, we have been working on the China-Albania route, carrying out the glorious transportation tasks entrusted to us by the two parties and peoples of China and Albania. From our personal experiences over the past few years, we deeply feel that the peoples of China and Albania are closely connected and share a common destiny. The friendship between the peoples of China and Albania is the greatest revolutionary friendship.

Every time we set foot on the heroic land of Albania, whether in ports or inland, cities or villages, we are warmly welcomed and treated like family by our Albanian comrades.

We will never forget the enthusiastic scene of visiting the "Mao Zedong Textile Combine." The male and female workers there surrounded us, singing and dancing joyfully.

We will especially never forget a worker from a certain factory in Tirana who, to thank Chairman Mao for the congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, meticulously made a bright red lamp. On the lamp, the word "Albania" was written, and below the lamp, there was a cartoon of the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries looking pale and disheveled, fully expressing the Albanian people's deep hatred for all class enemies.

The brave Albanian people, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour, have been waging an unyielding struggle against American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists, Yugoslav traitors, and other groups. Standing proudly on the Adriatic coast, they have become a great socialist beacon in Europe. At the same time, the Albanian people, with great courage, are engaged in socialist construction, transforming Albania from a backward and impoverished country into a socialist country with advanced industry and agriculture.

We have visited many factories, villages, military units, and schools in Albania. We have seen with our own eyes that the Albanian people are struggling against nature and overcoming numerous difficulties on the road to progress, achieving extremely brilliant results in socialist construction. We have been to the Logjçinë-Fieri railway construction site where the female hero Shkurtë Vata fought. Albanian youth are engaged in enthusiastic voluntary labor there.

During our stay in Albania, we have also witnessed many revolutionary measures taken by the Albanian Party of Labour in recent years. The Albanian people have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Labour Party and the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, actively participating in the revolutionary movement, striving to change backward customs, liberate women, oppose bureaucratism, and implement the participation of cadres in labor, among other things.

All the victories of our Albanian comrades are our victories. We sincerely wish that socialist Albania will become more prosperous and powerful and that the brave and hardworking Albanian people will achieve even greater successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

"Across the sea, there are friends; across the world, we are neighbors." The Albanian people and we are like brothers and sisters, like one family. In Albania, we not only felt the sublime revolutionary friendship but also saw the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, which greatly inspired us. This year on May Day, we saw Comrade Hoxha in Tirana, and we couldn't help but shed tears of joy and sing loudly. This reminded us of a day in 1965 when we visited a certain factory in Tirana. The workers gave us a fine portrait of Comrade Enver Hoxha. We treasure it as the most precious gift, keeping it together with the portrait of Chairman Mao, and looking at it several times a day. Every time we see the great leaders of our two parties and peoples, we are filled with boundless strength.

We will never forget the care of the Albanian Party of Labour and state leaders for all the crew members of our ship. Respected Comrades Shehu and Balluku have both personally visited the ship to extend their warm greetings. Every time we leave Albania, the Albanian leaders come to the ship to see us off. Last December 26, Comrade Shehu, on behalf of the People's Assembly of Albania, awarded our "International" ship with the collective Red Banner Medal and various medals and decorations, and held a grand award ceremony. All this fully demonstrates the unbreakable unity between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania.

Over the past few years, all of us, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have always remembered the teachings of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha. In the common struggle against imperialism and revisionism of the two peoples, we have made some efforts to strengthen the friendship between the peoples of China and Albania and socialist construction. As our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected." We must remain humble and diligent, ensure uninterrupted long-distance transportation, and continue to use our ships to connect the hearts of the Chinese and Albanian peoples even more closely. The united strength of the peoples of China and Albania is invincible. If imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries dare to touch a single hair of our Albanian brothers, they will surely face a thorough and shameful failure.

    万岁！伟大的中阿友谊
    中阿轮船公司“国际”号全体船员
    我们是中阿轮船公司“国际”号船员，长年累月战斗在中阿航线上，肩负着中阿两党和两国人民交给我们的光荣运输任务。我们从几年来的亲身经历中深切地感到，中阿两国人民是血肉相连、休戚相关的，中阿两国人民之间的友谊是最伟大的革命的友谊。
    每当我们踏上英雄的阿尔巴尼亚国土，无论在港口或内地，城市或乡村，都受到阿尔巴尼亚战友热情的欢迎和亲人般的接待。
    我们忘不了参观“毛泽东纺织联合工厂”的热烈场面。这个厂的男女工人把我们团团围住，纵情歌舞，喜气洋洋。
    我们更忘不了地拉那某工厂的一位工人，为了答谢毛主席给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电，精心制作了一盏红光灿烂的明灯。明灯上写着“阿尔巴尼亚”的字样，灯下面画着帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派脸色发白、狼狈不堪的漫画，充分表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民对一切阶级敌人的刻骨的仇恨。
    英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，与美帝国主义和苏修、南斯拉夫等国叛徒集团进行了不屈不挠的斗争，巍然屹立在亚得里亚海滨，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义明灯。同时，阿尔巴尼亚人民又以大无畏的英雄气概，从事着社会主义建设，把过去贫困落后的阿尔巴尼亚建设成一个具有先进工业和先进农业的社会主义国家。
    我们多次到阿尔巴尼亚的工厂、农村、部队、学校参观访问。我们亲眼看到，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在与天斗，与地斗，克服着前进道路上的重重困难，在社会主义建设中取得了极其辉煌的成就。我们曾经到过女英雄什库塔·瓦塔战斗过的洛格齐恩—费里铁路工地。阿尔巴尼亚男女青年正在那里进行热火朝天的义务劳动。
    我们在阿尔巴尼亚逗留时期，还亲眼看见了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党近年来采取的许多革命化措施。阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈响应劳动党和伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的号召，积极投身革命化运动，努力改变落后习俗，解放妇女，反对官僚主义，实行干部参加劳动等等。
    阿尔巴尼亚战友的一切胜利，都是我们的胜利。我们衷心祝愿社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚更加繁荣富强，祝愿勇敢、勤劳的阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得更加光辉的成就。
    “海内存知己，天涯若比邻”。阿尔巴尼亚人民与我们情同手足，亲如一家。我们在阿尔巴尼亚不仅感受了崇高的革命情谊，同时还见到了阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，受到很大的鼓舞。今年“五·一”劳动节，我们在地拉那看到了霍查同志，不禁热泪盈眶，纵情高唱。这使我们想起了一九六五年的一天，我们到地拉那某个工厂参观的时候，工人同志们送给我们一张恩维尔·霍查同志的精致的画像。我们把它作为最珍贵的礼物，和毛主席像一起保存着，每天都要看几遍。每当我们看见我们两党、两国人民的伟大领袖，浑身充满了无穷无尽的力量。
    我们决不会忘记，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和国家领导人对我们轮船全体船员的关怀。敬爱的谢胡同志和巴卢库同志都曾亲自到船上亲切问候。我们每次离开阿尔巴尼亚，阿尔巴尼亚领导同志都来船上送行。去年十二月二十六日，谢胡同志还代表阿尔巴尼亚人民议会，给我们“国际”号轮船颁授集体红旗勋章和各级勋章、奖章，并举行了隆重的授勋仪式。这一切，都集中表现了中阿两党两国人民牢不可破的团结。
    几年来，我们全体船员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢记毛主席和恩维尔·霍查同志的教导，在两国人民反帝反修的共同斗争中，为加强中阿两国人民的友谊和社会主义建设，尽了一点力量。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所说：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”我们一定戒骄戒躁，努力保证远洋运输不间断，继续用我们的轮船，把中阿人民的心连结得更紧。中阿两国人民团结的力量是不可战胜的。如果帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派胆敢动我们阿尔巴尼亚兄弟一根毫毛，等着他们的必将是彻底的、可耻的失败。
