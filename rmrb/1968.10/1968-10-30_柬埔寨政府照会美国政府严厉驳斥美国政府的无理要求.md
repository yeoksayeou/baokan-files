The Cambodian government has sent a note to the U.S. government, strongly rejecting its unreasonable demand to release the captured U.S. 1577th landing craft, which invaded Cambodia.

According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh on the 22nd, the Royal Government of Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the U.S. government on October 19, strongly rejecting its demand to release the captured U.S. 1577th landing craft, which had invaded Cambodia.

The note states that the detained U.S. 1577th landing craft is a military vessel that has repeatedly participated in the U.S. military's aggression against Cambodia. The note says that the U.S. government's claim that Cambodia captured the U.S. ship and its crew "for the purpose of negotiations" is a great insult to Cambodia and is an outright extortionist and even bandit-like accusation.

The note concludes that the U.S. government insists on refusing to seriously acknowledge Cambodia's current borders, refuses to stop its aggression against Cambodian territory, refuses to acknowledge the reality of its brutal attacks, and refuses to take responsibility for these attacks and their consequences. Under these circumstances, the Royal Government has no reason to take lenient measures towards the 1577th landing craft and its crew.

According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh on the 28th, the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent two notes to the Thai puppet regime on the 25th and 26th, strongly protesting against the Thai puppet regime's aggression against Cambodia.

In the first note, the Royal Government of Cambodia strongly protested against the Thai puppet regime's armed aggression in the Cambodian province of Battambang, where two Cambodian civilians were killed by landmines and grenades.

The other note strongly protested against the Thai boats' four consecutive violations of Cambodian territorial waters in September. The note pointed out that during these violations, two Thai motorboats and two other boats were intercepted in Cambodia's Koh Kong province.

    柬埔寨政府照会美国政府
    严厉驳斥美国政府的无理要求
    据新华社金边电　据柬埔寨新闻社二十二日报道，柬埔寨王国政府外交部十月十九日照会美国政府，严厉驳斥它强要柬埔寨王国政府释放因入侵柬埔寨而被俘获的美国1577号登陆艇的无理要求。
    照会说，被扣留的美国1577号登陆艇，是一艘军用船只，它事实上无数次的参与了美军对柬埔寨的侵略。照会说，美国政府硬说柬埔寨是“为了谈判的目的”而截获这艘美国船只及船上人员，是对柬埔寨国家的极大的侮辱，是不折不扣的讹诈性的、甚至是强盗式的指责。
    照会最后说，美国政府坚持拒绝严肃地承认柬埔寨目前的边界，拒绝停止它对柬埔寨领土的侵略，拒绝承认它的残暴袭击的现实，拒绝对这种袭击及其后果承担责任。在这种情况下，王国政府根本没有理由要对1577号登陆艇及艇上人员采取宽大措施。
    新华社金边二十八日电　据柬埔寨新闻社报道，柬埔寨外交部在二十五日和二十六日两次向泰国傀儡集团发出照会，对泰国傀儡集团侵略柬埔寨的行径表示强烈抗议。
    在第一份照会中，柬埔寨王国政府强烈抗议泰国傀儡集团在柬埔寨马德望省用地雷和手榴弹炸死两名柬埔寨居民的武装侵略行径。
    另一份照会对泰国帆船在九月份连续四次侵犯柬埔寨领水的罪行，提出强烈抗议。照会指出，在这些侵犯事件中，泰国的两艘机帆船和另外两艘帆船在柬埔寨戈公省被截获。
