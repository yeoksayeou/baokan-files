	Pulling the Revolutionary Car for Life
	He Qin Yun, a Five-Good Soldier from the August 1st Unit

	The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promotes the "join the party to become an official" theory. He rants about how "in the past, passing the imperial examination meant becoming an official, and now, joining the Communist Party also means becoming an official." He also lures Communist Party members into "developing oneself" by becoming "factory directors" or "committee members." This is a self-portrait of the Chinese Khrushchev's ugly soul, a sugar-coated cannonball aimed at our Communist Party members, and a great slander against them!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communist Party members are not here to become officials, but to make revolution." Chairman Mao's great teachings concisely and profoundly summarize the qualities that Communist Party members should possess. In our country's great revolutionary struggles, countless Communist Party members who are infinitely loyal to the people and to Chairman Mao, have no personal ambitions, and dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the revolution. They bravely and resolutely fight to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly." Apart from this, they have no other goals. Countless Communist Party members have sacrificed their precious lives for the great cause of communism. Their glorious deeds have dealt a heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev's "join the party to become an official" theory.

	I enlisted in March 1960 and have been a member of the Chinese Communist Party for eight years. Since enlisting, I have been transferred thirteen times, moving up and down three times. I have raised ducks, raised pigs, fed horses, grown vegetables, cooked meals, and acted as a supply officer. No matter what work I do, I always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and see it as a contribution to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, as adding bricks and tiles to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Over the years, comrades who enlisted with me and those who joined the party later than I did have become platoon leaders and political instructors. I never have any grievances. I think this is a division of revolutionary labor, a need to strengthen the construction of the platoon and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. I feel from the bottom of my heart that being a servant of the people for life, being an ordinary soldier forever loyal to Chairman Mao, is the greatest honor and the greatest happiness.

	The "join the party to become an official" theory promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev is an attempt to corrupt our Communist Party members with the decadent ideas of the exploiting class seeking official positions and wealth. He wants to turn our Communist Party members into bourgeois careerists who pursue personal fame and profit, abandon the revolution, and betray the cause of the proletarian revolution. He aims to turn the Chinese Communist Party, composed of advanced elements of the proletariat, into a bourgeois revisionist party, to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. We must not fall for the Chinese Khrushchev's tricks. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to build an iron wall in our minds to prevent and resist revisionism, be servants of the people for life, pull the revolutionary car for life, and forever be brave fighters defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must thoroughly smash the Chinese Khrushchev's plot of peaceful evolution against Communist Party members and bury the Chinese Khrushchev and his "join the party to become an official" theory!

    拉一辈子革命车
    六八一五部队五好战士  何钦云
    中国赫鲁晓夫拚命地宣扬“入党做官论”。他胡说什么：“过去考上秀才就可以做官，现在加入了共产党，也可以做官”。他还诱骗共产党员为“当厂长”、“当委员”去“发展自己”。这是中国赫鲁晓夫丑恶灵魂的自我写照，是他射向我们共产党员的一颗糖衣炮弹，也是他对共产党员的莫大污蔑！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。毛主席的伟大教导，集中地、精辟地概括了共产党员应当具备的品质。在我国的伟大革命斗争中，广大无限忠于人民、无限忠于毛主席的共产党员，一不为名，二不为利，一心为革命。他们英勇果敢地为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务。除此以外，再无别的目的。成千成万的共产党员为了伟大的共产主义事业，献出了自己的宝贵生命。他们的光辉事迹，给了中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官论”当头一棒。
    我一九六○年三月入伍，加入中国共产党也有八年了。入伍以来，十三次调动工作，三上三下，放过鸭，养过猪，喂过马，种过菜，做过饭，代理过司务长。无论干什么工作，我都牢记毛主席的教导，把它看成是为捍卫毛主席的革命路线和巩固无产阶级专政贡献力量，看成是为中国革命和世界革命增砖添瓦。几年来，同我一起入伍的和比我晚入党的同志，有的当上了连长、指导员，我从不闹情绪。我觉得这是革命的分工，是加强连队建设和巩固无产阶级专政的需要。我从内心中感到：当一辈子人民的勤务员，当一辈子忠于毛主席的普通一兵，是最大的光荣，最大的幸福。
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“入党做官论”，就是要以剥削阶级的升官发财的腐朽思想，来腐蚀我们共产党员，妄图使我们共产党员变成追求个人名利地位，唯利是图，放弃革命，背叛无产阶级革命事业的资产阶级个人野心家，妄图把无产阶级先进分子组成的中国共产党变成资产阶级修正主义的党，以达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。我们决不能上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，我们一定要用毛泽东思想在头脑里筑成一道防修反修的钢铁长城，当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车，永远当捍卫毛主席革命路线和巩固无产阶级专政的英勇战士，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫对共产党员进行和平演变的阴谋，把中国赫鲁晓夫连同他的“入党做官论”彻底埋葬！
