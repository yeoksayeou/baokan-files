Boom Squad Hero Dong Cunrui's Father—Dong Quanzhong—was elected as a member of the Revolutionary Committee at the Zhangjiakou Region, Huailai County, and Dong Cunrui Commune levels. He often works outside the village. Once, when he returned to the village, he heard someone saying, “Old Dong has become a big ‘official,’ he’ll soon fly away!” Others said, “He’s become a committee member of the region, it’s different now, he can’t work with us on the soil clumps.” Dong Quanzhong felt very wronged, thinking: I haven’t been idle at all, being a leader and being a common person, the work is just different!

The comrades from the army supporting the leftist cause understood Dong Quanzhong’s thoughts and had a heart-to-heart talk with him. They pointed out that as a committee member, one must maintain the character of a laboring people, never detach oneself from the masses or from labor, and must constantly reform one’s thoughts. One must always accept the supervision and help of the masses. That night, Dong Quanzhong, with his thoughts in mind, studied Chairman Mao’s teachings on “All our work comrades, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people.” Chairman Mao’s words opened his mind, making him understand a truth: being an official and being a common person in the old society were completely different. At that time, the relationship between being an official and being a common person was one of oppression and being oppressed. In today’s society, being an “official” and being a common person are both serving the people. He pondered over the masses’ comments, mainly because he hadn’t labored with the masses for several months. He remembered that after becoming a committee member, he indeed had the thought of being “different,” and participating in labor was not as frequent as before.

Starting from the next day, Dong Quanzhong went to the fields to work. He demanded of himself to be diligent with his hands, eyes, and mouth, and set five rules for himself: even if his position changes, his affection for the poor and lower-middle peasants does not change; even if his position is high, his character as a laboring people does not change; even if his life improves, his frugal and simple style does not change; even if he is old, his red heart for Chairman Mao does not change; even if his body is weak, his will to revolution to the end does not change. He worked just like before, not caring whether the work was light or heavy, not minding whether the weather was good or bad, not calculating the amount of pay, and working together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Once, while weeding, comrades advised him, “Old Dong, you’re old now, just give us some advice, that’s good enough.” To take care of his health, they even found light work for him. He said, “You can do it, I can do it too. If you want to treat me specially, then find some heavy work for me.” He still worked with the commune members as before. He also actively participated in the great criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev with the poor and lower-middle peasants, holding criticism meetings in the fields, and facing off against a handful of class enemies.

The masses praised Dong Quanzhong, saying: “Old Dong, after becoming a committee member, has something the same as before, that is, working with us and being our confidant; and something different from before, that is, he is the leader in the revolutionary criticism, diligent in labor, and a good servant of the poor and lower-middle peasants.”

    当委员，也当农民
    爆破英雄董存瑞烈士的父亲——董全忠被选为张家口地区、怀来县、董存瑞公社三级革命委员会委员，经常在外边工作。有一次，他回到村里，听到有人议论：“人家董大爷当大‘官’了，早晚得远走高飞！”还有人说：“人家当上专区的委员，不一样啦，那能和咱们一起摆弄土坷垃。”董全忠一听，觉得挺委屈，心想：我整天也没有闲着，当领导和当群众，工作就是不一样嘛！
    部队支左的同志，摸着了董全忠的心思，就找他谈心，向他指出，当了委员，要保持劳动人民的本色，决不能脱离群众、脱离劳动，要不断改造自己的思想，要永远接受群众的监督和帮助。晚上，董全忠带着自己的思想问题，学习了毛主席关于“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”的教导。毛主席的话打开了他的心窍，使他弄明白一个道理：当官和当老百姓，在旧社会是完全不一样的。那时，当官和当老百姓的关系是压迫和被压迫的关系。在今天的社会里，当“官”当老百姓都是为人民服务的。他琢磨群众的议论，主要是因为自己几个月没有和群众一起劳动了。他想起自己当了委员后，的确是因为有了个“不一样”的想法，参加劳动不象过去那样经常了。
    从第二天起，董全忠就下地去劳动，用手勤、眼勤、嘴勤来要求自己，给自己规定了五条约法：地位变了，贫下中农的感情不变；职位高了，劳动人民的本色不变；生活好了，艰苦朴素的作风不变；年纪大了，忠于毛主席的红心不变；体质弱了，革命到底的意志不变。他同过去一样，劳动不问活轻活重，干活不分天气好坏，出勤不计报酬多少，同贫下中农劲往一处使，汗往一处流。有一次锄地，同志们劝他说：“董大爷，您年纪大啦，给俺们出个点子就满好了。”为了照顾他的身体，还给他找轻活干。他说：“你们能干，我照样能干，要说特殊点，那你们给我找点重活才对。”他仍然同社员们一起照样地干活。他还和贫下中农一起积极投入对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判运动，在田头开批判大会，同一小撮阶级敌人展开面对面的斗争。
    群众赞扬董全忠说：“董大爷当了委员，有和以前一样的地方，那就是和我们一起劳动，当我们的贴心人；有和以前不一样的地方，那就是，革命大批判他是带头人，参加劳动是勤劳人，是贫下中农的好勤务员。”                           龚华
