As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the latest directive: "Broad cadres should go down to labor, which is a great opportunity for them to relearn. Except for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." This is the greatest concern, greatest education, and greatest care for the revolutionary committees' old and new cadres. From our personal experience, we deeply understand that broad cadres participating in labor is a great strategic measure to ensure that the revolutionary power will never change color.

Last September, after our factory's revolutionary committee was born in the storm of class struggle, to strengthen our connection with the masses, all members went deep into the workshops to participate in labor, and no one was exempted from production. However, not long after, some comrades spent more time in the office and less time in labor. At this time, some of the masses spoke seriously, "Our revolutionary committee members are changing!" The comrades from the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory saw this situation and timely helped us repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor.... This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism." Then, a discussion was held among the members of the revolutionary committee. In the discussion, some old cadres recalled the bitter lessons before the Cultural Revolution, when they were high above, long separated from labor and the masses, and unconsciously carried out the revisionist line of building the factory. Through the discussion, everyone realized that cadres separating from labor would separate from the masses, like fish out of water and seedlings out of soil, would deteriorate, and would lose power. The revolutionary committee decided: all members of the revolutionary committee should go deep into the workshops to participate in labor.

Through more than a year of practice, we deeply feel that cadres participating in labor is indeed "a great opportunity for them to relearn." In labor, our greatest gain is that we gradually established a deep class sentiment with the worker masses, promoted our own thought revolutionization, and promoted the revolutionization of the revolutionary committee's work. Over the past year, the members of our revolutionary committee have been both "officials" and "common people," truly blending with the workers. The workers have no hesitation in sharing their thoughts, raising their opinions, and discussing their difficulties with us. In the evenings, we gather to discuss the factory's work and promptly solve the problems discovered that day. Some old cadres, who had long been separated from labor in the past, had increasingly distant relationships with the workers; after participating in labor, they broke down their official demeanor and became closer to the workers. New cadres, by insisting on not leaving their production posts, although their positions have changed, their working-class nature has not changed, and they have maintained a vigorous revolutionary spirit. In participating in labor, the worker masses' high level of class struggle consciousness, two-line struggle awareness, and daring and fearless revolutionary spirit constantly educate and raise us, making us continuously improve our abilities and better lead the masses forward.

Chairman Mao's latest directive has pointed out a bright path for the thought revolutionization of the old and new cadres in our revolutionary committee. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, forever fight on the front line of production labor, relearn in the process of labor, thoroughly reform all non-proletarian thoughts, build the revolutionary committee into a fighting collective that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever hold power for the proletariat, and use power for the proletariat.

    广大干部重新学习的极好机会
    天津向东卫生材料厂革委会
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入斗、批、改阶段的时候，伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新指示：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”这是对革命委员会的新老干部的最大关怀、最大教育、最大爱护。我们从亲身体会中深刻认识到：广大干部参加劳动，是保证革命政权永不变色的伟大战略措施。
    去年九月，我厂革委会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中诞生后，为了加强同群众的联系，全体成员都深入班组参加劳动，没有一个人脱产。可是没过多久，有的同志坐办公室的时间又多了，参加劳动少了。这时候，有的群众就语重心长地说：“咱革委会的人要变了！”驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志看到这种情况，及时地帮助我们反复学习毛主席“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。……这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义”的教导，然后在革委会成员中展开了一场讨论。在讨论中，有的老干部回忆了文化大革命前，自己高高在上，长期脱离劳动、脱离群众，以致不自觉地执行了修正主义建厂路线的沉痛教训。通过讨论，大家认识到，干部脱离劳动，就会脱离群众，就是鱼离水，苗离土，就要变质，就要丢权。革委会决定：革委会成员全部深入班组第一线参加劳动。
    经过一年多来的实践，我们深深体会到，干部参加劳动，确确实实“对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会”。在劳动中，我们最大的收获就是和工人群众逐步建立了深厚的阶级感情，促进了自身思想革命化，也促进了革委会工作的革命化。一年多来，我们革委会的成员“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，真正同工人打成一片，工人心里有话就掏给我们，有意见向我们提，有困难向我们讲。晚上，我们就集中碰头研究厂里的工作，及时解决当天发现的问题。有的老干部，过去长期脱离劳动，和工人之间的感情越来越疏远；参加劳动后，打掉了官架子，和工人的感情接近了。新干部由于坚持不脱离生产岗位，虽然地位变了，但劳动人民的本色没有变，保持了旺盛的革命青春。我们在参加劳动中，工人群众高度的阶级斗争观念、两条路线斗争觉悟和敢想敢干的大无畏革命精神，随时都在教育我们，提高我们，从而使我们在向群众学习的过程中不断增长才干，更好地领导群众前进。
    毛主席的最新指示，为我们革委会新老干部的思想革命化指出了光明大道。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，永远战斗在生产劳动第一线，在劳动的过程中重新学习，彻底改造一切非无产阶级思想，把革委会建设成永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战斗集体，永远为无产阶级掌好权，用好权。
