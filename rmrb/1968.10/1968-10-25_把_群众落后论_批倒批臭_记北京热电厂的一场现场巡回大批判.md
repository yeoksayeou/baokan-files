The brilliant morning sun shines upon the tall chimneys and workshops of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant. The exhaust pumps, which roar day and night, are clearing away the burned waste. Workers, facing the morning light, breathe in the fresh air and head towards the boiler rooms, coal conveyors, and maintenance towers. Car after car of black raw coal is being transported through the coal conveyance system and injected into the massive furnaces, releasing tremendous heat. The high-voltage power lines on the transmission towers are continuously transmitting powerful currents to all corners of the capital.

Today, the workers of the thermal power plant have studied the latest directive from our great leader Chairman Mao on "renewing and discarding the old," and have decided to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment for rectifying and building the party. They will all take to the battlefield, engage in close combat, and conduct an on-site, mobile, large-scale criticism. They will focus on criticizing the revisionist party-building line of China's Khrushchev, using the revolutionary light and heat of the thermal power plant to burn away the reactionary "theory of the masses being backward" that he has spread within the plant.

When people, having seized the class enemy, first arrived at the bricklaying brigade by the large chimney billowing with thick smoke, this advanced collective in the entire plant for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and an advanced model for conducting brigade-level criticism, was in high spirits, repeatedly raising their arms and shouting, "Down with China's Khrushchev!"

"Thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line!"

As soon as the slogans fell, the entire plant's advanced activist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, Deng Guangchen, stood up abruptly and said firmly: Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and trusts us, the working class, the most. But China's Khrushchev dares to say that the masses are "backward" and "stupid." He doesn't look at us, the working class, at all, and says we have no culture, that we can't be relied upon. If workers and poor and lower-middle peasants want to join the party, it's extremely difficult. Because we say what we think and don't beat around the bush. Fish find fish, shrimp find shrimp, and turtles find toads. The capitalist roaders in the plant love those who can talk and flatter, who are human in front and ghosts behind. They are traitors, spies, and all kinds of counter-revolutionaries. Saying this, he pointed at the remnant of the Nationalist Party standing next to the capitalist roaders and said, "This is the 'good party member' they recruit." Chairman Mao teaches us to "remove the dross and take in the fresh." We must resolutely expel these bastards from the party and never let their plot to restore capitalism succeed!

The crowd, after hearing Comrade Deng Guangchen's speech, were so angry their lungs almost burst. They pointed at the capitalist roaders and asked, "What are these people you promote and appoint? Why do you bring them into the party?" Faced with the iron facts, the capitalist roaders were dumbfounded, had no words to reply, and had to admit their heads bowed, acknowledging their heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism.

When the criticism team arrived at the base of the tall furnace wall of the main workshop, they happened to meet the operating workers who had just finished a night of intense battle. They were all spirited and vigorous, displaying a spirit of fearlessness of fatigue and continuous combat. They immediately turned the production site into a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. In the boiler room, where pipes crisscross and flames roar, people, using Chairman Mao's latest directives as their weapons, launched a merciless criticism of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the plant who had spread the "theory of the masses being backward"!

As soon as the battlefield was set up, the workers quickly surrounded the capitalist roaders. A young worker angrily asked, "You bastards, in the past, you treated the masses like a puppet and treated a handful of traitors, spies, and remnants of the Nationalist Party as jewels in the palm of your hand, forcibly bringing them into the party. You even said in the tone of China's Khrushchev, 'Don't think that relying on the working class is problem-free.' If the working class can't be relied upon, then who can you rely on?" As soon as the words fell, the worker representative who participated in the National Day celebration, who bravely stood up to rebel against the capitalist roaders during the Cultural Revolution, and who has always insisted on combining revolution with production, the young brigade leader Lian Baozhong, rushed forward. He said, "The working class is the leading class. Our great leader Chairman Mao has given us, the working class, the greatest trust, honor, and highest position. This year, during the National Day celebration, being able to stand with Chairman Mao and watch the parade is a tremendous joy. But China's Khrushchev dares to say that the masses are 'backward,' truly a scoundrel! In the past, they excluded us, the working class, from the party's doors and implemented bourgeois dictatorship over the working class, pressing us so hard we couldn't breathe. Fortunately, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the working class, followed Chairman Mao, rebelled against the capitalist roaders, seized their power, and ascended to the political stage of struggling, reforming, and criticizing the superstructure. We played the role of the main force, and now the power generation has reached an all-time high in the plant's history. Currently, just the surplus power generation in our plant is equal to the total power generation in Beijing before liberation. We, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, must join the vanguard of our own class—the Communist Party of China. We join the party, not for promotion and wealth, not for personal gain, but to defend the red political power of the proletariat to the death, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death, to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat to the death, and to better support the world revolution!"

When the revolutionary masses dragged this bunch of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders to the coal conveyance bridge under the advanced collective for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works—the coal conveyance automation group—the coal conveyance group workers pointed at the continuously operating coal conveyance belt on the coal conveyance bridge and loudly asked the capitalist roaders, "In the past, you followed China's Khrushchev in saying that the masses are 'backward,' saying that we coal workers are 'coal blackies,' saying that our fuel workshop is a 'chicken coop'; instead, you elevated the historical counter-revolutionary who you placed on the 'secretary' throne to be a 'phoenix.' You oppressed and fined us workers, not looking at us at all. You even said that 'the working class only needs to eat well and sleep well,' which is sheer nonsense. At that time, when we workers wanted to join the party, you obstructed us in every possible way. But it is we, these 'coal blackies' whom you look down upon, who, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, successfully carried out seven coal conveyance automation innovation projects and overcame the 'old, large, and difficult' problems in production. Can these achievements be accomplished by the 'red people' you rely on?" This powerful blow to the head left the capitalist roaders speechless. The young worker Wang Ming was even more enraged, stepping forward and saying, "You bastards listen up: In the past, you slandered the workers as backward, calling us 'coal blackies,' unpresentable, and locking us in the house during foreign visits. But we coal workers have black faces and red hearts, the most loyal to Chairman Mao. While you capitalist roaders are harboring a nest of bad people, doing all sorts of evil. Today, we workers are in charge, and we must thoroughly clean out all this dross!"

    把“群众落后论”批倒批臭
    ——记北京热电厂的一场现场巡回大批判
    灿烂的朝阳，照耀着北京热电厂高大的烟囱和厂房。日夜轰鸣的排浆泵，清除着燃烧过的废料。工人们迎着晨光，舒畅地呼吸着新鲜的空气，走向锅炉房、输煤桥、检修塔……。一车车乌黑的原煤，正通过输煤系统，喷送到高大的炉膛里，发出强大的热能。架在线塔上的高压线路，源源不断地把强大的电流输送到首都的四面八方。
    今天，热电厂的工人学习了伟大领袖毛主席“吐故纳新”的最新指示，决定紧跟毛主席整党建党的伟大战略部署，人人上战场，短兵相接，对着活材料来他一场现场巡回大批判。他们集中狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，用热电厂革命的光和热，烧尽他在厂内散布的反动的“群众落后论”。
    当人们揪着阶级敌人，首先来到冒着滚滚浓烟的大烟囱旁的二连瓦工班时，这个全厂活学活用毛主席著作的先进集体、开展班组大批判的先进典型，群情激昂，不断地振臂高呼：“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”
  “彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线！”口号声刚落，全厂活学活用毛主席著作积极分子邓广臣噌的一下子站了起来，斩钉截铁地说：我们伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最相信俺们工人阶级，可中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“群众落后”、“愚蠢”。他根本没把俺们工人阶级放在眼里，还说我们没有文化水儿，不能依靠。工人、贫下中农要想入党，那更是非常困难。因为咱有啥说啥，不会拐弯抹角。鱼找鱼，虾找虾，乌龟找王八。厂内的走资派爱的是能说会道，当面是人，背后是鬼的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子。说着，他就手指着站在走资派旁边的那个被拉入党内的国民党残渣余孽说，这就是他们发展的“好党员”。毛主席教导我们要“清除废料”，“吸收新鲜血液”。我们一定要坚决把这帮家伙清除出党，决不让他们复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞！
    大伙听了邓广臣同志的发言，肺都快要气炸了。齐声指着走资派质问道：“你们提拔重用的这帮人是什么东西；为什么把他们拉入党内？”在铁的事实面前，走资派瞠目结舌，无言答对，不得不低头认罪，承认他们妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
    当大批判的队伍来到了主厂房高大的炉墙下时，正赶上紧张战斗了一夜的运行工人刚刚下了夜班，他们人人精神抖擞，发扬了不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，立刻把生产的现场，变成了革命大批判的战场。就在管道纵横、炉火熊熊的锅炉房内，人们以毛主席的最新指示为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在厂内的代理人所散布的“群众落后论”展开了无情的批判！
    战场一摆开，工人们“刷”的一下子围住了走资派，一名青年工人气愤地质问道：“你们这帮家伙，过去把群众当成阿斗，把一小撮叛徒、特务和国民党残渣余孽看成是掌上明珠，硬把他们拉入党内，还按照中国赫鲁晓夫的腔调说什么：‘不要以为依靠工人阶级是没有问题的’。工人阶级不能依靠，你们要依靠谁？”话声刚落，参加国庆观礼的工人代表、在文化大革命中勇敢起来造了走资派的反，始终坚持抓革命、促生产的青年班长连宝仲师傅冲上前来。他说：“工人阶级是领导阶级，伟大领袖毛主席给了咱工人阶级最大的信任、荣誉和最高的地位。今年国庆节，能和毛主席他老人家一起观看游行队伍，这是天大的喜事。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却说什么‘群众落后’，真是混蛋透顶！他们过去把咱工人阶级排斥在党的大门外，对工人阶级实行资产阶级专政，压得咱们喘不过气来。多亏毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，咱们工人阶级紧跟毛主席，造了走资派的反，夺了他们的权，登上了上层建筑斗、改、批的政治舞台，发挥了主力军的作用，现在发电量创造了全厂历史最高水平。目前仅是咱们厂超出的发电量，就等于北京解放前的总发电量。我们无产阶级革命派就是要加入自己阶级的先锋队——中国共产党。我们入党，一不为升官发财，二不为个人名利，就是为了誓死捍卫无产阶级的红色政权，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政，更好地支援世界革命！”
    当革命群众把这帮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派揪到输煤桥下活学活用毛主席著作的先进集体——输煤自动化小组的时候，输煤组的工人手指着输煤桥上持续运转的输煤皮带，大声向走资派质问道：“你们过去跟着中国赫鲁晓夫胡说‘群众落后’，说俺们输煤工人是煤黑子，说俺们燃料车间是‘鸡窝’；反倒把被你们抬到‘支部书记’宝座上的历史反革命分子称为‘凤凰’。你们对工人又是压，又是罚，根本不把俺们放在眼里。还胡说什么‘工人阶级只要吃好睡好就成了’，这简直是胡说八道。那时我们工人要入党，你们就千方百计地进行阻挠。可就是俺们这些被你们看不起的‘煤黑子’，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，搞成功了七项输煤自动化革新项目，攻克了生产上的‘老、大、难’。这些成就，难道你们所依靠的‘红人’能办到吗？”这有力的当头一棒，质问得走资派哑口无言。这个班的青年工人王明更是一气冲上来，当的一句：“你们这批家伙听着：过去，你们污蔑工人落后，骂我们是煤黑子，见不得人，外宾参观时就把我们锁在屋里。可我们输煤工人脸黑心红，对毛主席最忠。而你们这些走资派却是包庇一窝坏人，干尽了坏事。今天我们工人当了家，非得把你们这批废料全部彻底清除掉不可！”
