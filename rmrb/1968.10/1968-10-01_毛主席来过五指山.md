Chairman Mao has been to Wuzhishan,
Dispersed the dark clouds to reveal the blue sky,
The Li people with bows in hand make revolution,
Drive away the wolves to build a new home.

Chairman Mao has been to Wuzhishan,
The Cultural Revolution blazes with fervor,
Sweep away all the monsters and demons,
Mao Zedong Thought shines red across the sky.

    毛主席来过五指山
    黎族　文明英
    毛主席来过五指山，
    驱散乌云见青天，
    黎家持弓闹革命，
    赶走豺狼建家园。
    毛主席来过五指山，
    文化革命起烈焰，
    牛鬼蛇神一扫尽，
    毛泽东思想红满天。
