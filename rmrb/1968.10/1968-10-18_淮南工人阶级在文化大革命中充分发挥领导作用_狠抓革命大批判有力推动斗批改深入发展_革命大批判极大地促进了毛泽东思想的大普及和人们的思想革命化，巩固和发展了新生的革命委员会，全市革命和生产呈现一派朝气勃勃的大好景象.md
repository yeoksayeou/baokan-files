The working class of Huainan fully exerted its leadership role in the Cultural Revolution, vigorously promoting revolutionary criticism to drive the struggle, criticism, and transformation (fight, criticize, and reform) forward. Revolutionary criticism greatly promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, consolidated and developed the newly established revolutionary committees, and presented a vibrant and prosperous scene of revolution and production throughout the city.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 17th: The working class of Anhui Province's Huainan City fully exerted its leadership role, closely combining the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and led the broad revolutionary masses to launch an even more magnificent wave of revolutionary criticism. In the entire coal city's mines, factory workshops and teams, office departments, store counters, school classrooms, and various streets and workers' dormitories, revolutionary criticism fires were ignited everywhere, powerfully driving the work of cleaning up class ranks, rectifying the party, streamlining organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations, and transferring office personnel to victory on all fronts. Through revolutionary criticism, Mao Zedong Thought was widely disseminated, people's thinking was revolutionized, the revolutionary alliance and the three-in-one combination were consolidated and developed, and the newly established revolutionary committees were consolidated and developed. The entire city presented a vibrant and prosperous scene of revolution and production.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work must be fully exerted. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." To ensure the organizational leadership of the working class over revolutionary criticism, the Huainan Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings, led various units to establish revolutionary criticism leadership groups at all levels with workers as the main body. Organizationally, it ensured that the working class, loyal to Chairman Mao, led revolutionary criticism. The entire city quickly presented a new situation where thousands of troops were pursuing the enemy, and within a short period, the city held various criticism meetings totaling 14,300 times, with 2,720,000 people participating in revolutionary criticism, averaging 130 criticism meetings per day. The city set up 3,200 revolutionary criticism columns and published 8,800 issues.

After the working class led the revolutionary criticism in various factories, mines, enterprises, and offices and schools in the superstructure, it demonstrated keen political insight, timely discovered problems, and decisively solved them, making the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement surge forward wave after wave. In the early days of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Huainan Chemical Fertilizer Factory, only a few "scholars" were engaged in revolutionary criticism in the factory, which was detached from the reality of class struggle and cold and desolate. A handful of class enemies took the opportunity to establish an "underground command center" and carried out extensive rightist splittist activities, attempting to overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committee in one fell swoop. After the factory Revolutionary Committee mobilized the worker masses to strengthen the leadership of revolutionary criticism, the worker masses immediately discovered this problem. They first exposed the ringleaders of the splittist activities and used them as live materials for criticism, launching a massive exposure and criticism. The entire factory held seven criticism meetings, 22 broadcast criticism meetings, and more than 40 workshop criticism meetings, quickly igniting the flames of revolutionary criticism throughout the factory, and the revolutionary and production situation was completely transformed. Huainan Xie San Mine, which started production in 1956, was a new mine. Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the mine vigorously promoted "bonus as the commander" and other revisionist goods, with an astonishing number of reward items, reaching more than 30 kinds, including annual bonuses, monthly bonuses, quarterly bonuses, year-end bonuses, coal quality bonuses, savings bonuses, teacher-student contract bonuses, as well as "contract bonuses," "hard work bonuses," and "consolation bonuses" to soothe emotions. From 1963 to 1965 alone, more than 500,000 yuan in bonuses were distributed. In the revolutionary criticism, workers linked Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line with their personal experiences, angrily exposing that "material incentives" and "bonus as the commander" were "poison hidden in honey" and "a soft knife that kills without blood." Through criticism, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad worker masses rapidly increased, and the revisionist "bonus system" was smashed, highlighting proletarian politics, making the entire mine's revolution and production vibrant.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Establish revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination, carry out criticism, clean up class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, transfer office personnel, and in factories, the struggle, criticism, and transformation generally go through these stages." The working class of Huainan, through their struggle practice, deeply felt that Chairman Mao's latest instructions most brilliantly and correctly summarized and generalized the basic content and fundamental path of struggle, criticism, and transformation, serving as a guiding light for all fronts to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation. In the magnificent revolutionary criticism movement, they always regarded revolutionary criticism as both an important content of struggle, criticism, and transformation and a powerful driving force for carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation. They combined the specific situation of Huainan, where class struggle has always been sharp and complex, to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Huainan who promoted the revisionist organizational line and cadre line of capitulation and surrender, and in combination with the cleanup of class ranks, launched continuous and fierce attacks on class enemies, exposing deeply hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries. They used criticism as a weapon to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents who promoted "expert management," "material incentives," and "technology as the commander" and other revisionist goods, smashing unreasonable regulations, establishing systems that highlight proletarian politics, mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the broad worker masses, and promoting the great development of production. They used revolutionary criticism to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line in the construction of political power, promoting the smooth progress of streamlining organizations and transferring office personnel, and powerfully promoting the revolutionization of offices and the revolutionary transformation of cadres' thinking.

In the early stage of cleaning up class ranks, the Huainan Mining Bureau did not properly combine the cleanup of class ranks with revolutionary criticism, resulting in a situation of emphasizing "cleanup" but not "criticism," and "expose, criticize, and ignore." As a result, the already exposed class enemies became arrogant and prepared to counterattack. The bureau Revolutionary Committee, in response to the above situation, mobilized the masses to severely criticize and struggle against the already exposed class enemies, closely combining revolutionary criticism with the cleanup of class ranks. Through revolutionary criticism, they thoroughly investigated enemy situations, exposed cover-ups, and uncovered clues, exposing not only the walking capitalists but also the class enemies hidden among workers, cadres, and family members, and severely striking a small handful of class enemies. In the streamlining of organizations, some office cadres in Huainan Power Plant had the thought of "it's hard to be transferred, and it's hard to stay." The factory Revolutionary Committee mobilized the worker masses to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line in the construction of political power, making everyone realize that streamlining organizations is not just a matter of reducing a few people but a major issue concerning the proletarian dictatorship for thousands of years. This promoted the smooth progress of the streamlining work, achieving both the satisfaction of those who stayed and the happiness of those who were transferred. The new working organization was streamlined from the original seven departments with 182 people to three groups with 39 people.

Revolutionary criticism greatly increased the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad worker masses in Huainan. Many worker masses, in summarizing their experiences and feelings of participating in revolutionary criticism, said, "Revolutionary criticism is a treasure. Deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, class enemies have nowhere to escape, and the red base is firmly defended!"

    淮南工人阶级在文化大革命中充分发挥领导作用
    狠抓革命大批判有力推动斗批改深入发展
    革命大批判极大地促进了毛泽东思想的大普及和人们的思想革命化，巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会，全市革命和生产呈现一派朝气勃勃的大好景象
    据新华社合肥十七日电　安徽省淮南市的工人阶级充分发挥领导作用，紧密结合斗、批、改，带领广大革命群众掀起了更加波澜壮阔的革命大批判热潮。在整个煤城的矿山井口，工厂的车间和班组，机关的科室，商店的店堂，学校的课堂，以及各条街道和职工宿舍等场所，全市到处点燃起革命大批判的熊熊烈火，有力地推动着各条战线清理阶级队伍、整党、精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员等项工作的胜利进行。通过革命大批判，极大地促进了毛泽东思想的大普及，促进了人们的思想革命化，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会，全市革命和生产呈现出一派朝气勃勃的大好景象。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”为了保证工人阶级在组织上对革命大批判的领导，淮南市革委会遵照毛主席的伟大教导，领导各单位层层建立了以工人为主体的革命大批判领导小组。在组织上保证了忠于毛主席的工人阶级对革命大批判的领导，全市很快出现了一个千军万马追穷寇的新局面，在很短的时间内，全市就先后召开了各种批判会一万四千三百多场，有二百七十二万人次参加了革命大批判，平均每天召开批斗会一百三十场。全市共办大批判专栏三千二百多块，出刊八千八百多期。
    工人阶级领导了各厂矿企业和机关、学校等上层建筑领域的革命大批判以后，表现了敏锐的政治洞察力，能及时发现问题，果断地解决问题，使斗、批、改运动一浪高过一浪地向前发展。淮南化肥厂在革委会成立初期，厂里的革命大批判只有少数“秀才”去搞，脱离了阶级斗争实际，冷冷清清，一小撮阶级敌人伺机成立“地下指挥部”，大搞右倾分裂活动，妄图一举颠覆新生的革委会。厂革委会发动工人群众加强对革命大批判领导以后，工人群众就敏锐地发现了这个问题。他们首先将策划分裂活动的首恶分子揪了出来，当作大批判的活材料，展开了声势浩大的大揭发，大批判，全厂先后举行了七次批判大会，二十二次广播批判会，四十多次车间批判会，使全厂革命大批判的烈火迅速燃烧起来，革命和生产面貌为之一新。淮南谢三矿是一九五六年投入生产的新矿，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本矿的代理人大肆推行“奖金挂帅”等修正主义黑货，“奖励”名目之多，达到了惊人的程度，什么年奖、月奖、季奖、年终奖、煤质奖、节约奖、师徒合同奖，还有什么“包工奖”、“辛苦奖”，照顾情绪的“安慰奖”等等，共有三十多种，仅一九六三年到一九六五年，就发掉奖金五十多万元。在革命大批判中，工人们联系中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线，以亲身体会愤怒控诉“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”，是“包在蜜糖里的砒霜”，是“杀人不见血的软刀子”。通过大批判，广大工人群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高，摧毁了修正主义的“奖金制度”，突出了无产阶级政治，全矿革命和生产搞得生气勃勃。
    毛主席最近指出：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”淮南市工人阶级通过自己的斗争实践深刻体会到，毛主席的最新指示最英明、最正确地总结和概括了斗、批、改的基本内容和根本途径，是指引各条战线搞好斗、批、改的指路明灯。他们在轰轰烈烈的革命大批判运动中，始终把革命大批判既当作斗、批、改的一项重要内容，又当作搞好斗、批、改的强大动力。他们结合淮南市阶级斗争一向很尖锐、很复杂的具体情况，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在淮南代理人所推行的招降纳叛的修正主义组织路线和干部路线，结合清理阶级队伍，大张旗鼓地向阶级敌人发起了连续猛烈的进攻，清查出了隐藏很深的叛徒、特务和反革命分子。他们以大批判为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的“专家治厂”、“物质刺激”、“技术挂帅”等修正主义黑货，大破不合理的规章制度，建立突出无产阶级政治的制度，调动了广大工人群众的革命积极性和创造性，推动了生产的大发展。他们通过革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的修正主义路线，推动了精简机构、下放科室人员等项工作的顺利进行，有力地促进了机关革命化和干部思想革命化。
    淮南矿务局在清理阶级队伍的初期，没有把清理阶级队伍和革命大批判很好结合起来，出现了只重“清”，不重“批”，和一揪二轰三不管的现象。这样，已揪出的阶级敌人因为没有受到革命群众批斗，一度猖狂翻案，准备伺机反扑。矿革委会针对上述情况，广泛地发动群众，对已揪出的阶级敌人进行狠批狠斗，把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来，通过革命大批判，大查敌情，大揭盖子，大摆线索，结果不仅把走资派揪了出来，同时也把混入工人、干部和家属队伍中的阶级敌人清理出来，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。淮南发电厂在精简机构中，有些科室干部存有“下放难看，留着难干”的思想。厂革委会发动工人群众起来狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的修正主义路线，使大家认识到精简机构不仅是减少几个人的问题，而是关系无产阶级的江山千秋万代不变色的大问题，从而推动了精简工作的顺利进行，做到了留下的安心，下放的愉快。新的办事机构由原来七个科室一百八十二人精简为三个组三十九人。
    革命的大批判，极大地提高了淮南市广大工人群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。许多工人群众在总结自己参加革命大批判的心得体会时说，革命大批判是个宝，深入持久地开展革命大批判，阶级敌人无处逃，红色江山保得牢！
