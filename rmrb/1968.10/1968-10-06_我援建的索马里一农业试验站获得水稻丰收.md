	The rice and tobacco experimental station built with Chinese aid in Somalia, through the joint efforts of agricultural technicians and workers from both China and Somalia, has harvested a bumper rice crop. Recently, Somalia's Acting President and Speaker of the National Assembly, Sheikh Mukhtar Muhammad Hussein, and Acting Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Yasin Nur Hassan, along with other Somali leaders, received Chinese agricultural technicians and expressed their appreciation for the contributions made by the Chinese technicians.

	Somalia, due to long-term plundering and rule by imperialism in the past, has had to import rice every year since its independence. When the Somali people heard the news that this experimental station had produced rice, they were all overjoyed. Many people shouted, "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Somalia!" "Long live Mao Zedong!"

    我援建的索马里一农业试验站获得水稻丰收
    据新华社摩加迪沙电　中国帮助索马里建立的乔哈尔水稻和烟草试验站，在中索两国农业技术人员和工人的合作和努力下，获得了水稻丰收。索马里代理总统、国民议会议长谢赫·穆克塔尔·穆罕默德·侯赛因，代理总理、内政部长雅辛·努尔·哈桑以及索马里其他领导人最近接见了中国农业技术人员，对他们作出的贡献表示赞赏。
    索马里由于过去长期遭受殖民主义掠夺和统治，独立后每年需要进口大米。当索马里人民听到这个试验站生产出大米的消息时，无不欢欣鼓舞。许多人高呼：“索中两国人民的友谊万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”
