Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand,
The people of the whole nation stride forward;
The seas may dry up, the rocks may crumble,
We follow the leader without turning back.

Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand,
The mountains and rivers of the whole nation are all red.
In the triumphant song we celebrate National Day,
We are joyous, while the imperialists and revisionists are worried.

Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand,
The revolutionary wave surges forward.
We must seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation,
We will not rest until we achieve complete victory.

    毛主席挥巨手
    福州工人　郑荣知
    毛主席，挥巨手，
    全国人民大步走；
    海可枯，石可烂，
    紧跟领袖不回头。
    毛主席，挥巨手，
    全国山河都红透。
    凯歌声中过国庆，
    我们欢喜帝修愁。
    毛主席，挥巨手，
    革命浪潮滚滚流。
    认真搞好斗批改，
    不获全胜不罢休。
