The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope for foreign aid, but we cannot depend on it. We rely on our own efforts, on the creative power of all our military and civilian people." Self-reliance is the correct revolutionary path for developing production and scaling the heights of science and technology in our country.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the Chinese working class have surged forth like a mighty spring tide. They have taken up the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and overthrow the "slave philosophy to the West" and "crawling policy" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, and have more firmly taken the road of self-reliance. The workers of Tianjin Third Plastic Products Factory have successfully developed China's first turntable injection machine, which has reached the advanced world level, and this is one example.

Tianjin Third Plastic Products Factory was originally a merger of more than twenty small factories. The production equipment was primitive, with only some old and broken-down machinery, and even some old machines left over from the Qing Dynasty. How could they change this backward situation and catch up with modern advanced enterprises? Some cadres, under the influence of the idea of relying on state investment and "seeking size and foreign goods," wanted to replace all the old and broken-down equipment with imported equipment. They even closed the door and planned to import more than ten new machines. This would require an investment of 1350,000 yuan. This plan was firmly opposed by the workers. Comrades criticized this plan, saying it was a product of the slave philosophy to the West, lacking the spirit of the Chinese working class. Based on the opinions of the old workers, they mobilized everyone to discuss and formulate a new plan to strive for strength, make equipment by themselves, and thoroughly change the backward situation.

The maintenance turntable group took on the task of making the equipment. The group had only six or seven technical workers, with an average technical level of only 1.5. They studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught: "The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves. As long as these people take their destiny into their own hands and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they do not evade problems but solve them actively, any difficulty in the world can be overcome." Chairman Mao's teachings greatly inspired them, giving them the courage to take on the glorious and arduous task of changing the backward situation.

The first battle was to manufacture a vertical injection machine. The factory had no boring machine and could not process it. They went to some sister units, but the problem could not be solved. At this time, some people sneered, "You can't do this. It's like a toad wanting to eat swan meat, it's absurd!" At this time, Chairman Mao's teachings rang in their ears: "Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, should raise our courage." Inspired by Chairman Mao's teachings, they organized old workers to discuss and study repeatedly, giving full play to collective wisdom, and finally made a homemade special boring tool. Most of the materials used to make this special tool were scraps, costing only a few dozen yuan, but it performed the function that a boring machine worth tens of thousands of yuan could not. When boring, they used this boring tool to solve the problem and finally made more than twenty vertical injection machines.

Victory inspired them to strive for greater victories. Old worker Cow Shuzheng of the maintenance turntable group, in response to the problem of low production efficiency of plastic shoes, proposed the idea of making a turntable injection machine themselves. But the technical department replied, "Don't think too much. It's not that simple. We have already applied to the higher authorities to import an advanced turntable injection machine from a capitalist country, how good that would be!" Comrade Cow knew that buying such a machine would cost tens of thousands of yuan. He discussed with his comrades, and everyone decided to make it themselves to make Chairman Mao proud and bring glory to the motherland! Thus, under the condition of having no drawings or data, they carried forward the spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to revolutionize, and groped their way forward. They used old machines to first make a small turntable machine the size of a small shoe mold. After many repeated experiments, they finally injected the first shoe. This shoe was the first injection product of the factory, providing experience for the manufacture of the turntable injection machine and boosting the confidence to develop it. Just as they were intensively conducting experiments, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, began. This great revolution made them more enlightened, more clear-sighted, and more determined in their will, resolute to successfully develop the turntable injection machine, to add luster to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to use practical actions to refute the Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly smashing their entire counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

Under the support of the revolutionary committee of the factory and the stationed PLA, they fearlessly faced setbacks and ridicule, smashed the sabotage of class enemies, and after more than three years of efforts, hundreds of experiments, and thousands of improvements, they finally successfully developed China's first turntable injection machine, which has reached the advanced world level, at the critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was about to achieve comprehensive victory. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's line of "self-reliance" and "hard struggle"!

Once, people from capitalist countries came to visit. They asked, "Where was this equipment made?" The worker comrades told them, "It was made by our factory." They shook their heads in disbelief and said, "Can a factory like yours make such equipment? Was it made with the help of the whole country?" At this time, the worker comrades on the scene all burst into laughter. This laughter once again pronounced the shameful failure of the Chinese Khrushchev and the bourgeois "slave philosophy to the West" and "crawling policy," and gave the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries a resounding slap in the face!

The facts are exactly as the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the advanced world level in the not-too-distant future." The Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is the most revolutionary and the most creative. With a heart loyal to Chairman Mao, they will definitely be able to catch up with and surpass the advanced world level. Let the reactionaries at home and abroad tremble before us! Let the Chinese Khrushchev's "slave philosophy to the West" and "crawling policy" go to hell!

    埋葬“洋奴哲学”，走自力更生的道路
    ——记天津第三塑料制品厂试制成功我国第一台转盘注射机的战斗
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”自力更生，这是我国发展生产和攀登科学技术高峰的正确的革命道路。
    经过了无产阶级文化大革命的中国工人阶级，革命的积极性和创造性，象澎湃的春潮奔泻出来了。他们奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，批臭批倒中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“洋奴哲学”、“爬行主义”，更加坚定不移地走自力更生的道路。天津第三塑料制品厂的工人阶级，试制成功了赶上世界先进水平的我国第一台转盘注射机，就是其中一个例子。
    天津第三塑料制品厂原是由二十多个小厂合并起来的企业。生产设备简陋，只有一些破旧设备，甚至还有清代遗留下来的旧机器。如何改变这种落后的面貌，赶上现代化的先进企业呢？有些干部在依赖国家投资和“贪大求洋”的思想支配下，想把原来破旧的设备都换成进口的设备，而且闭门造车，具体规划进口十几台新的机器。这样需投资一百三十五万元。这个规划，受到工人群众的坚决抵制。同志们批判这个规划，说它是洋奴思想的产物，没有中国工人阶级的气概。根据老工人的意见，发动大家讨论，重新制定了一个奋发图强，自己动手造设备，彻底改变落后面貌的规划。
    保全转盘小组承担了制造设备的任务。全组技术工人仅六七人，平均技术水平才一级半。大家学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”毛主席的教导给他们极大的鼓舞，使他们勇敢地担负起改变落后面貌的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    第一个战役，是制造一种立式注射机。厂里没有镗床，无法加工。他们跑了一些兄弟单位，也没有能解决。这时，有的人讽刺说：“你们哪干得了这个，真是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉，异想天开！”这时毛主席的教导响在他们的耳旁：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”在毛主席教导的鼓舞下，他们组织老工人多次反复的讨论研究，发挥集体的智慧，终于制成了一种土制专用镗眼工具。做这个专用工具大部分用的是废料，只花了几十元钱，但它却起到了十几万元的镗床所起不到的作用。在镗眼时他们用这种镗眼工具，解决了难题，终于制成了立式注射机二十余台。
    胜利鼓舞着他们去争取更大的胜利。保全转盘小组老工人牛树清同志针对生产塑料鞋生产率低的问题，提出要自己搞转盘注射机的设想。但技术部门却回答：“你不要尽想好事。哪有那么简单的，我们已经向上级申请了，从资本主义国家进口一台先进的转盘注射机，多好啊！”牛师傅知道，买这样一台设备要花几十万元。他跟同志们一谈，大家决心自己动手试制，为毛主席他老人家争气，为祖国争光！于是，在没有任何图纸、资料的条件下，发扬了敢想、敢干、敢于革命的精神，摸索着干。他们利用废机器先搞了一个只有一只小鞋模具大小的小转盘机，经过多次反复试验，终于注出了第一只鞋。这只鞋是这个厂第一个注射产品，它给制造转盘注射机提供了经验，增强了试制的信心。正当紧张地进行试验时，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命开始了。这场大革命，使他们心更明，眼更亮，意志更坚定了，决心把转盘注射机试制成功，为无产阶级文化大革命增添光采，用实际行动来回击中国赫鲁晓夫，彻底砸烂他们所推行的一整套反革命修正主义路线。
    在厂革命委员会和驻厂解放军的支持下，他们不怕挫折，不怕议论讥笑，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏，经过了三年多的努力，几百次的试验，上千次的改进，终于在无产阶级文化大革命即将取得全面胜利的关键时刻，试制成功了赶上世界先进水平的我国第一台转盘注射机。这是毛主席“自力更生”、“艰苦奋斗”道路的伟大胜利！
    有一次，资本主义国家的人来参观。他们问：“这设备是那里制造的？”工人同志告诉他们：“就是我厂自己制造的。”他们怀疑地摇摇头，说：“象你们这样的厂能制造出这样的设备？是全国帮助你们制造的吧？”这时在场的工人同志都哈哈大笑起来。这笑声，又一次宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫和资产阶级“洋奴哲学”，“爬行主义”的可耻破产，这笑声给了帝修反一记响亮的耳光！
    事实完全象伟大领袖毛主席指出的那样：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，最富有革命的彻底性，最富有创造力，凭着一颗忠于毛主席的红心，一定能够赶上和超过世界先进水平。让那些国内外反动派在我们面前发抖吧！让中国赫鲁晓夫的“洋奴哲学”、“爬行主义”见鬼去吧！
