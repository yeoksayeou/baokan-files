Three thousand striking automobile workers in Turin, Italy, held a demonstration on the afternoon of the 14th to protest police brutality.

On the morning of the 14th, hundreds of striking workers and students, who were distributing leaflets explaining their demands for the strike, were subjected to unreasonable interference and beatings by the police. The workers and students engaged in fierce struggles with the reactionary police.

Automobile workers had gone on strike for 48 hours the previous week to demand wage increases. To protest the police brutality, they decided to extend the current strike by an additional 24 hours.

    意大利三千工人示威抗议警察暴行
    意大利都灵市三千名正在罢工的汽车制造工人，十四日下午举行示威，抗议警察暴行。
    十四日上午，数百名罢工工人和参加他们斗争的学生在散发传单，说明他们罢工的要求时，一些人遭到了警察的无理干涉和殴打。工人和学生同反动警察展开了激烈的搏斗。
    汽车工人因为要求增加工资，曾在上周举行过四十八小时的罢工；为了表示抗议警察暴行，他们决定把目前这次罢工再延长二十四小时。
