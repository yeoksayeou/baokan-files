Revolutionary people all know that the first socialist country in the world, the Soviet Union, has been ruined by a bunch of traitors. There, the bad guys are in charge, and the good guys are oppressed; a small clique of traitors rules the world, and the vast majority of Soviet people suffer. The traitors Brezhnev and Kosygin have gone even further and faster than their predecessor Khrushchev in restoring capitalism. Without going into details, just look at agriculture: after they took power, they introduced all sorts of tricks, such as "dividing land to brigades," "contract production and rewards," "expanding private plots," abolishing restrictions on private livestock, and actively developing "free markets," and so on. All this has completely destroyed the socialist collective economy that Lenin and Stalin led the Soviet people to build. However, the Soviet revisionist clique boasts that they are "building communism," which is sheer nonsense!

Lies cannot deceive people. We poor and lower-middle peasants know best what communism is and what capitalism is.

"All crows are black." The Chinese Khrushchev is indeed a brother of the Soviet Khrushchev. During the three years of natural disasters in our country, he and his agents tried to push their revisionist goods, such as "borrowing land," "feeding livestock in separate stalls," "opening small wastelands," and so on, stirring up a capitalist black wind in the countryside.

Our Qiliying Commune is a red flag that the great leader Chairman Mao inspected and personally established. In 1958, after our beloved leader Chairman Mao saw our commune, he issued the great call to "People's Communes are good," pointing out a bright path to socialism for us poor and lower-middle peasants. However, the mad Chinese Khrushchev wanted to cut down the red flag of Qiliying and drag us onto the capitalist path.

Chairman Mao teaches us to take the road to common prosperity. The agents sent by the Chinese Khrushchev in 1961 wanted us to go it alone. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Qiliying Commune, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw through his tricks at a glance and decided to fight him. He said that private plots are "life-saving fields" and shouted that "large collectives are no good." We organized sessions of recalling bitterness and comparing the old with the new. Some old poor peasants who had escaped famine and begged for food in the old society said: "Dividing land, borrowing land, feeding livestock in separate stalls, isn't this clearly a return to individual farming? Isn't this going back to the old road?" Some commune members said: "Chairman Mao is our savior. We follow Chairman Mao on the socialist road, even if our heads are cut off and our bones are broken, our hearts will not change; even if we face knife mountains and fire seas, we will not turn back."

Because we held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and put proletarian politics in command, the collective economy has been consolidated and developed since the establishment of the commune. Grain and cotton production has increased year by year, and the lives of the commune members have become better and better. In the past, we were a grain-deficient commune. Since 1965, we have become a grain-surplus commune, achieving high yields of both grain and cotton. With the rapid development of production, the public accumulation of the commune and brigade and the income of the commune members have also increased greatly. In 1957, the commune had only 300,000 yuan in public funds, and each person received an average of 70 yuan. Now, the public funds have expanded to 7,700,000 yuan, and more than 50% of the households have savings in the bank. Compared with the time before the establishment of the commune, we can truly say that "people have changed, land has changed, production has changed, everything has changed; people are new, land is new, villages are new, everything is new."

However, the situation in the Soviet countryside is completely different.

The great Lenin said: "As long as there is small-scale economy and free exchange, capitalism will emerge." Because the Soviet revisionist clique vigorously promotes and develops private economy, advocates material incentives, and puts profits first, capitalist forces have run rampant. A group of speculators, embezzlers, thieves, exploiters of the people, and new rich peasants have taken control of the farms and collective farms. They rely on their power to exploit workers and farm members at will. The income of a farm chairman is tens of times higher than that of a farm member, forming a serious situation of polarization and wealth disparity. Many people, in order to get rich, also hire labor to operate their private plots, engaging in exploitation of hired labor. Today's so-called "socialist economy" in the Soviet Union is nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing.

Now, the Soviet revisionist clique continues to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, using the "material incentive" sugar-coated bullet to poison the people, leading people's thoughts to "self-interest," making them forget about the collective and forget about the revolution. The Soviet revisionists try to use this method to consolidate their reactionary rule.

For revolutionary people, the question of which path to take is indeed a big issue. The Soviet revisionist clique takes the capitalist road, making the broad masses of Soviet laborers suffer twice. In our country, Chairman Mao leads us on the socialist road. Since liberation, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, have repelled the attacks of class enemies time and time again. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we finally exposed the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places, ensuring that the great socialist motherland will never change color. We follow Chairman Mao closely, always make revolution, and on the broad socialist road, the more we walk, the more energetic we feel, and the clearer our minds become.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Soviet Union is the first socialist country, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and the state in the Soviet Union has been usurped by revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the broad masses of the Soviet people, the broad masses of party members and cadres, are good and want revolution, and the revisionist rule will not last long."

Broad Soviet peasant brothers, rise up in rebellion! Only by overthrowing the Soviet revisionist ruling clique can the revolutionary cause of Lenin and Stalin shine again!

    两条道路，两般景况
    河南省新乡县七里营公社全体贫下中农
    革命人民都知道，世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联，被一伙叛徒糟踏得不成样子了。那里坏人当道，好人受气；一小撮叛徒统治天下，广大苏联人民受苦受难。勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一伙叛徒，在复辟资本主义方面比他们的祖师爷赫鲁晓夫走得更快，走得更远。别的不说，光是农业，在他们上台以后，就搞了许多鬼名堂，什么“分田到组”，“包产奖励”，什么“扩大自留地”，取消私养牲畜的限制，积极发展“自由市场”等等。这一来，把列宁、斯大林当年领导苏联人民所建立起来的社会主义集体经济破坏得一干二净。但是，苏修叛徒集团却大吹牛皮，胡说他们在“建设共产主义”，真是活见鬼！
    撒谎骗不了人。我们贫下中农最懂得什么是共产主义，什么是资本主义。
    “天下乌鸦一般黑”。中国的赫鲁晓夫不愧是苏联赫鲁晓夫之流的师兄弟。他和他的代理人在我国三年自然灾害期间，以为时机已到，拚命推销修正主义黑货：什么“借地”啦，“牲口分槽喂养”啦，“大开小荒地”啦，等等，在农村中刮起了一股资本主义黑风。
    我们七里营公社是伟大领袖毛主席视察过并亲手树立起来的一面红旗。一九五八年，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席看了我们的公社后，发出“人民公社好”的伟大号召，给我们贫下中农指出了一条通向社会主义的光明大道。但是，丧心病狂的中国赫鲁晓夫却要砍掉七里营这面红旗，把我们往资本主义道上拉。
    毛主席教导我们要走共同富裕的道路。中国赫鲁晓夫一九六一年派来的走卒却要我们搞单干。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七里营公社的贫下中农和革命干部，一眼看穿了他的阴谋诡计，大伙儿便合计着跟他斗。他胡说自留地是“救命田”，嚷着“大集体搞不好”。我们就组织忆苦思甜，进行新旧对比。一些过去在旧社会逃过荒、讨过饭的老贫农说：“分地、借地，牲口分槽喂养，这不明明是恢复单干吗？这不是又要回到老路上去吗？”有的社员说：“毛主席是咱们的救命恩人，咱们跟毛主席走社会主义道路，头断骨碎心不变，刀山火海不回头。”
    由于我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，公社化以来，集体经济不断巩固和发展，粮棉产量逐年上升，社员生活过得愈来愈美。过去我们是缺粮社，从一九六五年起，变成了余粮社，实现了粮棉双高产。随着生产的迅速发展，社队的公共积累和社员收入也大大增加。一九五七年公社只有公积金三十多万元，社员分配每人平均七十多元。现在，公积金已经扩大到七百七十万元，有百分之五十以上的农户，在银行有存款。和公社化前相比，真可以说是“人变，地变，产量变，一切都变；人新，地新，村庄新，满目全新。”
    但是，在现在的苏联农村中却完全是另一番景象。
    伟大的列宁说过：“既然存在着小经济，既然存在着交换自由，也就会产生资本主义”。由于苏修叛徒集团大肆扶植和发展私有经济，大搞物质刺激，利润挂帅，使得资本主义势力泛滥成灾。一批投机倒把、贪污盗窃、压榨人民的资产阶级分子和新富农掌握着农场和农庄的印把子。他们倚仗权势，为所欲为地剥削工人和庄员，一个农庄主席的收入比一个庄员要高出十几倍至几十倍，形成了两极分化、贫富悬殊的严重局面。不少人为了发财致富，还雇佣劳动力为自己经营宅旁园地，进行雇工剥削。今天苏联的所谓“社会主义经济”，不过是挂羊头卖狗肉。
    现在，苏修叛徒集团继续大造反革命舆论，用“物质刺激”这颗糖衣炮弹来毒害人民，把人们的思想往“私”字上引，叫他们忘掉集体，忘掉革命。苏修叛徒们企图用这种办法，去巩固他们的反动统治。
    对革命人民来说，走什么样的路，实在是个天大的问题。苏修叛徒集团走资本主义道路，使苏联广大劳动人民受二遍苦。在我国，毛主席带领我们走社会主义道路。解放以来，中国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，打退了阶级敌人一次又一次的进攻。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，终于揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在各地的代理人，保证了伟大祖国的社会主义江山永不变色。我们紧跟毛主席，永远闹革命，在社会主义的康庄大道上，越走越带劲，越走心里越亮堂。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”
    广大的苏联农民兄弟们，坚决起来造反，只有推翻苏联修正主义统治集团，才能使列宁和斯大林的革命事业重放光芒！
