In the southern suburbs of Zanzibar City, in the new industrial area of Mbweni, a tractor and farm implement repair factory built with Chinese aid has recently been completed. Many Zanzibari friends came to the factory to visit, filled with joy, and warmly congratulated the Chinese engineering and technical personnel and Zanzibari workers on their joint efforts to achieve another success.

The factory is mainly for repairing tractors and large-scale mechanized agricultural implements such as seeders, five-share plows, and disc harrows. Construction began in mid-August of last year, machinery installation started in April, and the entire project was completed by mid-July, taking less than a year. It was designed based on the principles of economy, practicality, and reducing the labor intensity of workers. It has nearly a hundred new types of machinery and equipment, some of which have a high degree of automation. Some Zanzibari workers affectionately refer to these devices as "the noble gifts from Chinese worker brothers."

It is natural that Zanzibari friends are particularly happy about the rapid completion of this repair factory. In the past, the long-term rule of British colonialism resulted in Zanzibar's single economy: Zanzibar is rich in cloves and coconuts, but grain mainly relies on imports from abroad. After the January 1964 revolution, the Zanzibari government and people have done a lot of work to expand agricultural production.

During the intense construction and equipment installation period, Chinese engineering and technical personnel, with the support of Zanzibari workers, worked day and night, rarely resting on Sundays. Some residents living near the factory praised, "The Chinese experts work all day long."

To meet the urgent needs of Zanzibar's agricultural development, according to the requirements of Zanzibar's agricultural sector, Chinese agricultural machinery technicians also trained more than 300 tractor drivers in just over half a year. During this period, they helped repair dozens of tractors, thus meeting the needs of the agricultural production season last year. Now these trainees have become the main force of Zanzibar's mechanized agricultural operations.

To cultivate qualified tractor drivers in a short period, Chinese engineering and technical personnel emphasized practical training in their teaching. The technicians in charge of training sat in the driver's seat for six or seven hours a day, personally guiding the trainees to operate in turns. To ensure uninterrupted training, they often worked in the rain during the rainy season. Zanzibari trainees were deeply moved by the hardworking and serious teaching spirit of the Chinese personnel.

During this period, some Chinese engineering and technical personnel also went to various rural tractor stations to repair tractors or went to the fields to help eliminate faults. To save time, they would go to the countryside early in the morning with tools, dry food, and water bottles, climbing on the muddy tractors all day, working until the tractors were repaired, often returning to their accommodations very late. There was also an old technician who often worked overtime, making parts on a lathe. In just a few months, he processed 25 types of tractor parts, totaling more than 1,300 pieces. Local farmers were very welcoming when they saw the Chinese personnel coming to help repair tractors. Some watched, some helped clean, and some brought coconuts to quench their thirst. The farmers also praised the Chinese Dongfanghong brand tractors for being sturdy, durable, and efficient, very suitable for Zanzibar's needs.

Chinese engineering and technical personnel expressed their commitment to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, continue to do a good job in technical training, support Zanzibar's development of its national economy, and further contribute to the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania.

### 桑给巴尔拖拉机和农具修配厂落成  中桑工人协作取得又一成果

    桑给巴尔拖拉机和农具修配厂落成
    中桑工人协作取得又一成果
    据新华社桑给巴尔电　在桑给巴尔市南郊的姆博温尼新工业区，由中国援助建设的一座拖拉机和农具修配厂最近落成了。许多桑给巴尔朋友满怀着喜悦的心情来厂参观，热烈祝贺中国工程技术人员和桑给巴尔工人共同努力取得的又一成果。
    这个工厂主要是修配拖拉机和播种机、五铧犁、圆盘耙等大型机械化农具的。从去年八月中旬动工兴建，今年四月安装机器，七月中旬全部建成，总共用了不到一年时间。它是本着经济，实用，减轻工人劳动强度的原则设计的，有近百台各种新型的机器设备，有的机器的自动化程度很高。一些桑给巴尔工人把这些设备亲切地称为“中国工人兄弟送来的崇高礼物”。
    桑给巴尔朋友们对这座修配厂的迅速建成感到特别高兴是很自然的。过去，英国殖民主义的长期统治造成了桑给巴尔的单一经济：桑给巴尔盛产丁香和椰子，但粮食主要靠从外国进口。一九六四年一月革命后，桑给巴尔政府和人民为扩大农业生产进行了大量的工作。
    在紧张的施工和设备安装期间，中国工程技术人员在桑给巴尔工人的支持下，日以继夜地工作，星期天也很少休息。一些住在工厂附近的桑给巴尔居民赞扬说：“中国专家一天到晚总是在工作。”
    为了适应桑给巴尔发展农业的迫切需要，根据桑给巴尔农业部门提出的要求，中国农业机械技术人员还在半年多一点的时间内，为桑给巴尔培训了三百多名拖拉机驾驶员，并在这期间帮助检修了几十台拖拉机，从而满足了去年农业生产季节的需要。现在这批学员已成为桑给巴尔农业机械耕作的基本力量。
    为了在短期内培养出合格的拖拉机驾驶员，中国工程技术人员在教学中特别强调联系实际。负责培训的工程技术人员每天在驾驶室里一连坐六、七个小时，亲自指导学员轮流实际操作。为了不间断培训工作，雨季里也常常冒着雨干。桑给巴尔学员对中国人员工作刻苦、教学认真的精神十分感动。
    这期间，有些中国工程技术人员还到各地农村拖拉机站检修拖拉机，或深入田间帮助排除故障。为了抢时间，他们一早带上工具、干粮、水壶下乡，在满是泥巴的拖拉机上爬来爬去，干上一整天，直到把拖拉机检修好，经常很晚才能回到住处。还有一位老技工，经常加班加点，在车床上赶制零件，短短几个月就加工了拖拉机零件二十五种，一千三百多件。当地农民看到中国人员来帮助检修拖拉机，都十分欢迎。有的围着观看，有的帮助清洗，有的送来解渴的椰子。农民们还赞扬中国东方红牌拖拉机坚固耐用、效率高，很适合桑给巴尔需要。
    中国工程技术人员表示要遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，继续做好技术培训工作，为支援桑给巴尔发展民族经济，为增强中国、坦桑尼亚两国人民的友谊，进一步贡献自己的力量。
