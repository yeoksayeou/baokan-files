A delegation from the Albanian Party and Government, led by Comrade Bekir Balluku, visited the Shihezi Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps today and was warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of military farmers with singing and dancing.

Leaders from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the Xinjiang Military Region, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 7335 Unit, including Wang Enmao, Pei Zhouyu, Tan Kaiyun, Cao Danuo, Kong Ruiyun, Li Jingshan, and Wang Zhendong, as well as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Wang Xinting and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua, who accompanied the delegation to Urumqi, joined the visit to Shihezi.

Shihezi was adorned with red flags today, presenting a festive atmosphere. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of military farmers who have achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in defending and building the country's border regions were in high spirits, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, to warmly welcome their Albanian comrades.

In the morning, the delegation traveled by car from Urumqi to the outskirts of Shihezi City. Subsequently, Comrade Balluku, accompanied by Comrades Wang Enmao and Wang Xinting, and Comrade Marko, accompanied by Comrades Pei Zhouyu and Qiao Guanhua, boarded open-top cars and entered the city, receiving the most enthusiastic welcome from tens of thousands of military farmers lining the streets.

At the grand welcome rally held by the military farmers, Comrade Pei Zhouyu spoke first. He said that the visit of the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Balluku to Xinjiang and the Shihezi Reclamation Area is a great encouragement and support for the people of Xinjiang and the broad masses of military farmers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution alongside the people of the entire country. He highly praised the heroic Albanian people for following the teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha to "hold a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other to build socialism," achieving self-reliance and hard work, and making brilliant achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. He expressed that the broad masses of military farmers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps will forever follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, unite with the Albanian people, fight together, and achieve victory together.

Comrade Marko spoke in the midst of extremely enthusiastic applause. He praised the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary masses in Xinjiang for achieving great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said that the Revolutionary Committee, established on the basis of the three-in-one combination in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which consists of thirteen ethnic groups, fully reflects the iron-like unity of the Chinese people in political and ideological terms, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries who have played all sorts of tricks and attempted to restore capitalism in Xinjiang. Let the enemies tremble before your victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

He said that now, our Party and people are mobilizing to resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The entire Albanian people are united, holding their pickaxes and guns, working hard to build and defend the socialist motherland, and maintaining high vigilance. Imperialism, revisionism, and all enemies who dare to oppose our motherland will surely suffer a fierce counterattack and be thoroughly defeated.

Comrade Marko also highly praised the fraternal friendship and unbreakable unity between the two parties, the two countries, and the two governments of Albania and China.

After the meeting, the Albanian comrades visited the Shihezi General Farm. In the vast fields surrounded by green trees, military farmers were harvesting abundant sugar beets. Comrade Balluku and others had cordial conversations with the military farmers.

The military farmers mentioned that during the Cultural Revolution, by studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, carefully managing, and overcoming drought, the sugar beet yield this year was better than in previous years. Comrade Balluku happily wished the military farmers greater achievements.

The Albanian comrades also visited the August 1st Cotton Mill, danced with the textile workers to celebrate the long life of Chairman Mao, and sang songs praising Sino-Albanian friendship.

During the visit, the Albanian comrades also had cordial meetings with representatives of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of workers, as well as representatives of activists who study Chairman Mao's works, and model workers from factories and farms.

In the afternoon, the delegation returned to Urumqi under the escort of tens of thousands of military farmers.

    在军垦战士们举行的盛大欢迎会上，裴周玉同志首先讲话。他说，以巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问新疆和石河子垦区，是对正在同全国人民一道夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新疆各族人民和新疆军区生产建设兵团广大军垦战士的巨大鼓舞、巨大支持。他高度赞扬了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民遵照恩维尔·霍查同志“一手拿镐，一手拿枪建设社会主义”的教导，自力更生、艰苦奋斗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就。他表示，新疆军区生产建设兵团的广大军垦战士，将永远遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，同阿尔巴尼亚人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    马尔科同志在极其热烈的掌声中讲了话。他赞扬新疆的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了伟大的胜利。他说，由十三个民族组成的新疆维吾尔自治区在革命三结合的基础上成立的革命委员会，充分体现了中国各民族政治思想上钢铁般的团结，给了耍尽阴谋诡计，妄图在新疆实现资本主义复辟的美帝、苏修和印度反动派以沉重的打击。让敌人在你们无产阶级文化大革命的胜利面前发抖吧！
    他说，现在，我们党和我国人民正在动员起来，针锋相对地同美帝和苏修进行坚决的斗争。全体阿尔巴尼亚人民一致奋起，紧握手中的镐和枪，为建设和保卫社会主义祖国而英勇地劳动和保持高度的警惕。帝国主义、修正主义以及所有胆敢反对我们祖国的一切敌人，必将遭到猛烈的回击和彻底的失败。

    军垦战士们谈到在文化大革命中，由于活学活用毛泽东思想，精心管理，战胜干旱，今年甜菜产量比往年好。巴卢库同志高兴地祝军垦战士们取得更大的成就。
