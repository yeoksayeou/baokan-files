Aden, October 14 (Xinhua) - A military parade and mass rally were held in Aden, the capital of South Yemen, to celebrate the national day of the People's Republic of South Yemen.

President Qahtan al-Shaabi of South Yemen inspected the troops and the marching columns. In the procession, there were two military trucks carrying American weapons seized by the South Yemeni people in their counterattacks against the armed subversion activities of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary regime of Saudi Arabia against the People's Republic of South Yemen.

On the evening of the 13th, President Shaabi, in a speech at a mass rally, denounced U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and its support for Israel against Arab countries. He also condemned the conspiracy activities against the People's Republic of South Yemen plotted by the reactionary regime of Saudi Arabia, which is a lackey of U.S. imperialism.

On October 14, 1963, the South Yemeni people launched an armed struggle against British colonial rule. After four years of armed struggle, the South Yemeni people achieved independence from British colonial rule on November 30 of last year and established the People's Republic of South Yemen. The South Yemeni authorities recently announced that October 14 would be celebrated as the national day of South Yemen, and November 30 as the day of independence.
