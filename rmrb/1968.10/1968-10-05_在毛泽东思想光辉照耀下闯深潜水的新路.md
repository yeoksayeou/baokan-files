We are an ordinary work team involved in the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. On this joyous day of celebrating the official opening of the railway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, as we look back on the years of struggle in building the bridge under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, we, the bridge builders, are filled with immense emotion. All our thoughts and feelings can be summed up in one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!

The Yangtze River is deep and swift, with strong winds and high waves, making underwater construction extremely difficult and complex. Deep-sea diving is one of the three major challenges in the bridge construction. To make Chairman Mao proud and for the long-term benefit of the bridge construction, our work team of dozens of people united as one, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, embodying the fearless revolutionary spirit of the working class—fearing neither hardship nor death. With the help of our comrades in the People's Liberation Army and the support of our brother work teams, we bravely broke through the "warning line" of deep-sea diving, blazing a new trail for China's diving industry.

How did we blaze this new trail in diving? It was not by relying on heaven or earth, but by relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. To blaze our own path in deep-sea diving, we must master the basics. We deeply understand that first, we must train our minds, and with Mao Zedong Thought arming our brains, we can create any miracle in the world! Comrades all say: First train the mind, then the skills will be solid. Following the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin, we take Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, reading them every day and learning from them at all times. Whenever we encounter problems, we study; whenever we face difficulties, we read. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought gives us boundless strength and wisdom, guiding us to successfully blaze a new trail in diving.

Chairman Mao said, "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns." In blazing this new trail in diving, we also went through a fierce struggle. Initially, when we proposed using traditional methods for deep-sea diving experiments, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party not only did not support us but also criticized us harshly; the so-called technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie also shouted, "There is no precedent for this in the country, and there is no record of it in international literature." However, the Chinese working class, who are absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, must take the road that no one has taken before and do the earth-shaking deeds that no one has done before. Our comrades in the team said well: "The world may be vast, but it is not as vast as Chairman Mao's grace; the river may be deep, but it is not as deep as our hatred for imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. To build an anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist bridge as soon as possible, even if we are crushed to pieces, we are willing." Thus, we firmly blaze our own path in deep-sea diving.

In the process of exploring the new path in diving, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, we engaged in one battle after another against the harsh natural environment. During the ascent and descent of pressure, there are often large temperature differences, sometimes hot and sweating all over, sometimes cold and shivering all over. In winter, the river water is ice-cold, and during deep-sea diving, it is easy to cause nitrogen narcosis. However, no matter how great the difficulties, they cannot intimidate the divers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Our comrades in the team firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle precisely to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." We confront difficulties head-on and let others take the honor. In the battles of flood control and rescue, clearing rock layers, removing obstacles, surveying the riverbed, and blocking sand flow, everyone strives to be the first and bravely takes the lead.

In the struggle to explore the new path in diving, on the one hand, we strive to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese working class to dare to think and dare to do, and on the other hand, we also conduct scientific experiments with our feet firmly on the ground, concentrating everyone's wisdom to solve technical difficulties. Once, during the construction of a bridge pier, a sand-sliding phenomenon occurred, and the so-called technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie had no solution. After learning about this situation, our team leader, Comrade Song Wenfu, immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, held a team "Zhuge Liang meeting," and came up with a method of underwater electric welding, successfully stopping the sand flow. In the process of our exploration of the new path in diving, countless vivid examples all show: The Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has boundless creativity. They are not only the pioneers of revolution and production but also the masters of science and technology.

Today, we are determined to maintain the style of being modest, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to continuously improve our political awareness in the struggle, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to seize the revolution and promote production, and to make new contributions to the diving industry of our motherland!

### 在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下闯深潜水的新路

    新华社南京四日电　在我国自行设计、自行施工建造的最大的现代化桥梁——南京长江大桥铁路桥正式通车的大喜日子里，大桥工地的工人、技术人员、人民解放军支左、护桥部队指战员以及革委会成员纷纷写文章，热烈欢呼南京长江大桥的建成，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。他们用自己的亲身实践说明，掌握了毛泽东思想的我国工人阶级，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。下面是他们写的几篇文章：
    在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下闯深潜水的新路
    南京长江大桥南岸潜水工班
    我们是建设南京长江大桥的一个普通工班。在欢庆南京长江大桥铁路桥通车的大喜日子里，回顾在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下建设大桥的战斗岁月，我们建桥工人心情无比激动，千言万语并成一句话：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    长江水深流急，风大浪大，水下工程十分艰巨复杂，深潜水是大桥工程的三大难题之一。为了给毛主席争气，为了大桥建设的百年大计，我们工班几十个人一条心，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬工人阶级一不怕苦、二不怕死的大无畏革命精神，在亲人解放军的帮助下和兄弟工班的大力协助下，勇敢地突破了深潜水“警戒线”，为我国潜水事业闯出了一条新路。
    我们是怎样闯出这条潜水新路的呢？不靠天，不靠地，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。要闯出我们自己的深潜水道路，必须练好基本功。我们深深懂得，练功首先练思想，用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来！同志们都说：练功先练人，心红功才硬。我们遵照林副主席的教导，把毛主席的“老三篇”作为座右铭，天天读，时时学，碰到问题就学，遇到困难就读。战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的力量和智慧，指引着我们胜利地闯出了潜水新路。
    毛主席说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”我们闯出这条潜水新路，也经过了一番激烈的斗争。最初我们提出用土法子进行深潜水试验的时候，党内一小撮走资派不但不支持，反而横加指责；专以假学问吓人的资产阶级技术“权威”也大叫大嚷：“这样干国内没有先例，国际文献也没有记载。”但是，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的中国工人阶级就是要走前人没有走过的道路，要做前人做不出的惊天动地的事业。我们班的同志们说得好：“天地再大，没有毛主席的恩情大；江水再深，也没有我们对帝、修、反的仇恨深。为了早日建成反帝反修大桥，即使粉身碎骨，我们也心甘情愿。”就这样，坚定地闯我们自己的深潜水道路。
    在探索潜水新路的过程中，我们在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，同恶劣的自然环境展开了一场又一场的搏斗。在上升降压时，常常出现很大的温差，一会儿热得浑身冒汗，一会儿冷得全身发抖。冬天，江水更是冰凉彻骨，深潜水的时候，还容易引起氮气麻醉。但是，困难再大也吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的潜水工人。我们工班的同志牢记毛主席“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的教导，见困难就上，见荣誉就让。在防洪抢险，清岩层，排障碍，封江摸底，堵流沙的战斗中，人人不甘落后，个个奋勇当先。
    在摸索潜水新路的战斗中，我们一方面努力发扬中国工人阶级敢想敢干的革命精神，另一方面，也脚踏实地地进行科学试验，集中大家的智慧，解决技术难题。一次，有一个桥墩在施工过程中发生了翻沙现象，资产阶级技术“权威”根本拿不出解决问题的办法。我们工班的同志知道这种情况后，工长宋文福同志立即组织大家学习毛主席著作，召开工班“诸葛亮会”，研究出水下电焊的办法，成功地堵住了流沙。在我们探索潜水新路的过程中，许许多多生动的事例都表明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，有无限的创造力，他们不但是革命和生产的闯将，也是科学技术的主人。
    今天，我们决心保持谦虚，谨慎，不骄，不躁的作风，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，抓革命，促生产，为祖国的潜水事业作出新的贡献！
