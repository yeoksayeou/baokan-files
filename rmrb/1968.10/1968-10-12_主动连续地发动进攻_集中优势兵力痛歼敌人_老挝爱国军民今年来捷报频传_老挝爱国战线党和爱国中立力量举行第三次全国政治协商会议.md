The heroic patriotic military and people of Laos have been employing the strategies and tactics of people's war from the upper to the lower regions, from the mountains to the plains, and on all battlefields. They have been launching continuous and proactive offensives against the enemy, annihilating a large number of enemy forces, reclaiming many strategic locations, and creating a favorable revolutionary situation.

In January of this year, the patriotic military and people of Laos, demonstrating their courage in battle, fearlessness of sacrifice, and unyielding spirit, concentrated superior forces to annihilate the enemy's combat forces. In the strategic location of Nam Bao in the upper region, they achieved a glorious victory since the Nan Ta triumph in 1962. In just fourteen days, the patriotic military and people of Laos annihilated more than 2,900 enemy forces, including the complete annihilation of six enemy battalions and the severe damage of three battalions, and shot down or destroyed thirteen enemy aircraft. The Nam Bao victory once again demonstrated the great power of the patriotic military and people of Laos.

Inspired by the Nam Bao victory, the patriotic military and people of Laos launched a series of offensives during the dry season, from the upper region of Phong Saly to the lower region of Champasak, from the banks of the Mekong River to the Laos-Vietnam border. The patriotic armed forces of Laos roamed freely, striking the enemy everywhere. The U.S. imperialists and their right-wing military forces in Laos were on the defensive and struggled to respond.

After seven months of fierce battles during the dry season, the patriotic military and people of Laos annihilated more than 16,000 enemy forces, shot down or destroyed more than 100 enemy aircraft, destroyed eighteen enemy command centers, and ravaged many enemy war logistics bases. They heavily struck the strategic mobile forces and "special forces" of the U.S. imperialists and their puppets, liberating 180,000 residents. The number of enemy forces annihilated by the patriotic military and people of Laos during this dry season was three times the total number annihilated during the 1966-1967 dry season. Additionally, the patriotic military and people of Laos reclaimed Tadheng, Taveng, Muang Nong, and the strategic location of Vientiane in the lower region, further expanding the liberated areas.

After achieving glorious victories during the dry season, the patriotic military and people of Laos, with a heroic stride, entered the rainy season of combat. Since the rainy season, the patriotic military and people of Laos have maintained the proactive advantages of the dry season, continuing to strike the enemy in the front and vigorously carrying out anti-bandit operations in the rear, achieving one victory after another. In the first few months of the rainy season, local forces and guerrilla units from various parts of Laos have shown their prowess. In addition to supporting the main forces in combat, they have also conducted independent operations, vigorously carrying out guerrilla warfare, cutting off enemy supply lines, blowing up enemy bridges, attacking enemy strongholds, launching fierce assaults on bandit nests, setting traps to encircle and annihilate the enemy, and delivering unexpected and heavy blows to the enemy.

The U.S. imperialists and their puppets are facing imminent doom under the internal and external attacks of the patriotic armed forces of Laos and the people in the enemy-occupied areas.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Kheang Khay, the Patriotic Front of Laos and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces held their third national political consultation conference in the liberated areas from September 7 to 13. The conference expressed its determination to further strengthen the great unity represented by the alliance of the Patriotic Front of Laos and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces and to carry the anti-American, pro-national war to final victory.

The conference pointed out that the achievements of the patriotic military and people of Laos in the 1967-1968 dry season proved the power of people's war and the rapid growth of the patriotic armed forces. The "special war" that the U.S. imperialists are waging in Laos has reached a dead end. The conference pointed out that the problem in Laos is one of U.S. interference and aggression. If the problem in Laos is to be solved, the United States must stop its interference and aggression and withdraw all its military personnel, weapons, and war tools, as well as the military personnel and forces of its puppets from Laos.

During the conference, Prince Souphanouvong and Kan Su, representative of the Patriotic Neutralist Forces, both spoke, emphasizing the need for the Patriotic Front of Laos and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces to strengthen their unity, strengthen their joint actions, and make greater efforts to achieve greater victories.

The conference unanimously adopted resolutions and declarations on the current situation and the tasks of all patriotic forces in Laos.

    主动连续地发动进攻  集中优势兵力痛歼敌人
    老挝爱国军民今年来捷报频传
    老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量举行第三次全国政治协商会议
    据新华社康开电　本社记者报道：今年以来，英雄的老挝爱国军民运用人民战争的战略战术，从上寮到下寮，从山区到平原，在各个战场上，主动连续地向敌人发动进攻，歼灭敌人大量有生力量，收复许多战略要地，打出一派大好革命形势。
    今年一月，老挝爱国军民发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳和连续作战的革命精神，集中优势兵力，痛歼敌人有生力量，在上寮战略要地南博取得了从一九六二年南塔大捷以来最辉煌的胜利。在短短的十四天中，老挝爱国军民共歼灭敌人两千九百多名，其中包括全歼敌军六个营和重创三个营，击落击毁敌机十三架。南博大捷再一次显示了老挝爱国军民的伟大力量。
    在南博大捷的鼓舞下，老挝爱国军民在旱季里连续发动了一系列进攻，从上寮的丰沙里到下寮的占巴塞，从湄公河畔到老越边界，老挝爱国武装力量纵横驰骋，到处出击敌人。美帝国主义及其老挝右派军队则处处被动，穷于应付。
    老挝爱国军民经过旱季七个月的英勇奋战，共歼敌一万六千多名，击落击毁敌机一百多架，摧毁敌军指挥部十八个，捣毁敌人许多战争后勤基地，沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其走狗的战略机动部队和“特种力量”，解放居民十八万。老挝爱国军民今年旱季的歼敌数字相当于一九六六——一九六七年旱季歼敌总数的三倍。此外，老挝爱国军民在今年旱季里还先后收复了塔通、塔文、芒囊等地，以及下寮战略要地——会山，进一步扩大了解放区。
    老挝爱国军民在旱季取得辉煌胜利之后，又以豪迈的步伐跨入了战斗的雨季。雨季以来，老挝爱国军民发扬旱季的主动优势，前方继续打击敌人，后方大力开展剿匪工作，取得了一个又一个的新胜利。在雨季的头几个月内，老挝各地的地方部队和游击队，大显身手，他们除了配合主力部队作战外，还独立作战，大力开展游击战，切断敌人交通线，炸毁敌人桥梁，袭击敌军据点，猛攻土匪巢穴，设置陷阱围歼敌人等等，给敌人以出其不意的沉重打击。
    美帝国主义及其走狗在老挝爱国武装力量和敌占区人民的内外夹攻之下，正面临着灭顶之灾。
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党和老挝爱国中立力量从九月七日到十三日在解放区举行了第三次全国政治协商会议。会议表示决心进一步加强以老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量的联盟为代表的全国大团结，把抗美救国战争进行到最后胜利。
    会议指出，老挝爱国军民在一九六七年到一九六八年旱季所取得的战果，证明了人民战争的威力和爱国武装力量的迅速增长。美帝国主义在老挝推行的“特种战争”已经进入了死胡同。会议指出，老挝问题是美国干涉和侵略的问题。如果要解决老挝问题，美国就必须停止它的干涉和侵略，从老挝撤走它的全部军事人员、武器和战争工具及其仆从的军队和军事人员。
    会议期间，苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国中立力量代表坎苏·高拉都讲了话，强调老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量之间加强团结、加强联合行动和作出更大的努力来争取更大的胜利。
    会议一致通过关于目前形势和老挝一切爱国力量的任务的决议和声明。
