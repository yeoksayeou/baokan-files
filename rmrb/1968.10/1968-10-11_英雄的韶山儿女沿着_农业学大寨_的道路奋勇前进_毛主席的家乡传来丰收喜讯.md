The heroic people of Shaoshan, following the path of "Agriculture Learns from Dazhai," are striding forward courageously. The hometown of Chairman Mao reports a bumper harvest.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Changsha, October 10th: The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members of Shaoshan People's Commune in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao, have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture." They have launched a widespread and in-depth mass movement to learn from Dazhai, achieving one victory after another in agricultural production. Following the bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice this year, despite the rare mountain floods in decades, the late-season rice is now golden and a bumper harvest is in sight. Inside and outside Shaoshan Valley, the scene is one of "joyfully watching the waves of rice and millet, and heroes descending in the evening smoke." Cotton and other crops have also yielded good harvests.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Shaoshan, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, deeply criticized the shameless fallacies of Liu Shaoqi and his agents who resisted learning from Dazhai. The revolutionary committee of the commune took measures to strengthen the leadership of the mass movement to learn from Dazhai, making the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai flourish in Chairman Mao's hometown and become a powerful force for promoting the thought revolution of the people and advancing agricultural production.

The broad masses of community members in Shaoshan People's Commune say: The fundamental experience of Dazhai is that the people of Dazhai read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, following the great leader Chairman Mao. The revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan People's Commune, starting from the fundamental experience of learning from Dazhai, persistently study and apply Mao Zedong Thought as the people of Dazhai do. They have held more than 270 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 10,000 people participating in the study. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized the students to visit the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence, using Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice as a shining example to raise the students' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the study classes carried out in-depth activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They focused on the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, carried out revolutionary criticism, and engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, thereby greatly promoting the thought revolution of the people and establishing the idea of working for the public and farming for the revolution. Many production teams, in the process of learning from Dazhai, further improved the system of "daily reading of Chairman Mao's works," pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high.

Due to learning from Dazhai and focusing on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, this year the entire commune has achieved fast progress, high-quality work, and good completion of tasks in several important production links such as transplanting, field management, and rushing harvest and planting. In the first half of this year, the commune, in addition to completing the state's grain procurement and reserving reserve grain, also voluntarily sold surplus grain to the state amounting to more than 50,000 jin.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members of Shaoshan People's Commune, in the movement to learn from Dazhai, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon to fiercely criticize and expose the revisionist goods promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, such as "work points in command," "material incentives," and the theory of "class struggle extinguished." They established a labor management system like that of Dazhai, with "politics in command, labor for the public, standard work points, and self-reporting and public discussion." After implementing this advanced labor management system, the broad masses of community members worked hard, labored selflessly, loved the collective, loved the country, and exhibited model deeds of promoting class brotherhood. These deeds, like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, are becoming more and more numerous.

    英雄的韶山儿女沿着“农业学大寨”的道路奋勇前进
    毛主席的家乡传来丰收喜讯
    据新华社长沙十日电  我们伟大领袖毛主席的家乡——湖南省湘潭县韶山人民公社的广大贫下中农和社员群众，积极响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，广泛、深入地掀起农业学大寨的群众运动，夺得了农业生产一个又一个的胜利。继今年早稻中稻遭受几十年来少有的山洪灾害仍然获得比去年更好的收成之后，目前晚稻一片金黄，丰收在望。韶山冲内冲外呈现出“喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟”的壮丽图景。棉花和其他农作物也都获得了很好的收成。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动中，有着光荣革命传统的韶山人民，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人抵制农业学大寨的种种无耻谰言。公社革委会采取措施，加强了对学大寨的群众运动的领导，使大寨的革命精神在毛主席的家乡发扬光大，成为促进人的思想革命化和推动农业生产的强大动力。
    韶山人民公社广大社员群众说：大寨的根本经验，就是大寨人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席。韶山人民公社的革命干部和贫下中农，从狠抓学习大寨的根本经验入手，象大寨人那样坚持不懈地活学活用毛泽东思想。他们连续举办了二百七十多期各种不同类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有一万多人次参加了学习。毛泽东思想学习班组织学员参观了毛主席旧居陈列馆，以毛主席的伟大革命实践为光辉榜样，提高学员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，用毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。广大贫下中农和革命干部在学习班里深入开展忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，开展革命大批判，进行斗私批修，从而大大促进了人的思想革命化，树立了为公劳动，为革命种田的思想。许多生产队在学大寨的过程中，进一步健全了毛主席著作“天天读”的制度，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了新高潮。
    由于学习大寨，狠抓了活学活用毛泽东思想，突出了无产阶级政治，今年全公社在插秧、田间管理、抢收抢种等几个重要的生产环节中，都做到了生产进度快，功夫质量高，任务完成得好。今年上半年，公社除完成国家征购粮，留有储备粮外，还踊跃向国家交售余粮五万多斤。
    韶山人民公社广大贫下中农和社员群众在学大寨运动中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为强大武器，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等修正主义黑货，建立了象大寨那样的“政治挂帅，为公劳动，标准工分，自报公议”的先进劳动管理制度。实行这种先进的劳动管理制度以后，广大社员艰苦奋斗，忘我劳动，热爱集体，热爱国家，发扬阶级友爱精神的模范事迹，如雨后春笋，越来越多。
