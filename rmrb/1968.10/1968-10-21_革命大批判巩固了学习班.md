A machine gun company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Inner Mongolia was on a mission. They invited a poor and lower-middle class herdsman who understood Mandarin to act as a translator and enthusiastically helped the herdsmen of the Haisulamu Village to set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Every evening, not only adults but also elderly people and sensible children eagerly came to the study class.

Suddenly, a few herdsmen stopped coming to the study class for several nights in a row. The poor and lower-middle class herdsmen went to find them, but they didn't come. The soldiers from the machine gun company went to invite them, but they still didn't come, all saying they were "sick." The number of people who used this excuse to avoid participating in the study class increased day by day. At the same time, rumors spread in the village: "The soldiers speak Mandarin, we can't understand it. We should find someone who can read and speak Mongolian to teach us."

The company's party branch immediately realized that this was an attempt by class enemies to use the differences in nationality and language to sow discord between the military and the people, and to sabotage the Mao Zedong Thought study class.

At this time, Chairman Mao's latest directive came: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The company's party branch repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directive and believed that exposing the class enemies who were sabotaging the study class, implementing people's dictatorship over them, and defending the poor and lower-middle class herdsmen's right to study Mao Zedong Thought was the greatest protection and the greatest love for the broad masses of the poor and lower-middle class herdsmen.

Therefore, the party branch of the machine gun company, together with the broad masses of the poor and lower-middle class herdsmen, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution" and recalled the bitterness and sweetness of the past. Every poor and lower-middle class herdsman had a history of suffering, and every family had a record of blood and tears. At the meeting, the political squad leader of the first team, Sudurba, recalled his father dying in the cattle shed of the landlord, and how he was taken to the landlord's house at the age of seven and grew up in the landlord's sheep pen. After sharing his bitter history, he said with great emotion: "In the old society, the family history of the poor and lower-middle class herdsmen was 'family death.' The elderly starved to death, the children froze to death, and the adults worked to death. In the new society, we have cattle and sheep on the hills, and settled lives, all thanks to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle class herdsmen. We will follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with all our hearts, firmly and unshakably. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will fight to the end with all our might!" After the meeting, the soldiers of the machine gun company visited the homes of the herdsmen who had left the study class, conducted revolutionary criticism with them, helped them raise their class struggle awareness, and brought them back to the study class.

Next, the soldiers of the third company led the broad masses of the poor and lower-middle class herdsmen to fiercely criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev, and to lay out the class struggle situation in the brigade. One by one, the problems came out, and the class enemies were exposed. It turned out to be an untransformed reactionary herdsman who incited a bad element to spread rumors, sow discord between the military and the people, and sabotage the study class. Subsequently, in the study class, a special criticism session was held for the exposed class enemies. The first person who fell for the enemy's trick and left the study class, Ardenima, pointed at the class enemy's nose at the special criticism meeting and exposed their attempt to prevent the poor and lower-middle class herdsmen from studying the great Mao Zedong Thought and sabotage the study class. The class enemy had to bow down to the people and confess their crimes, and the masses implemented dictatorship over them. The poor and lower-middle class herdsmen said: "Class enemies are most afraid of special criticism." The class enemies were exposed, the masses' awareness was raised, and the Mao Zedong Thought study class became more and more solid.

    革命大批判巩固了学习班
    解放军某部机枪三连在内蒙古某地执行任务中，请懂得汉话的贫下中牧作翻译，满腔热情地帮助驻地海苏拉木大队蒙古族社员办起了毛泽东思想学习班。每天晚上，不但是成年人，连年迈的老人和懂事的小孩也争着到学习班来。
    突然，有几个社员接连几天晚上不来参加学习班。贫下中牧去找，不来，机枪三连的同志去请，也不来，都推说“有病”。借故不参加学习的人一天比一天多。与此同时，村里传出风声：“解放军说的汉话，咱们听不懂，要学习咱找识蒙文、说蒙话的人来教。”连队党支部立即警觉到，这是阶级敌人妄图利用民族不同，语言不通，挑拨军民关系，破坏毛泽东思想学习班。
    就在这时，毛主席的最新指示传来了：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”连队党支部反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，并且认为，揭露破坏学习班的阶级敌人，对他们实行群众专政，捍卫贫下中牧学习毛泽东思想的大权，是对广大贫下中牧最大的保护，是最大的爱民。
    于是，机枪三连党支部就在学习班里，和广大贫下中牧一起学习毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导，一起忆苦思甜。广大贫下中牧人人都有苦难史，家家都有血泪账。在会上，一队政治队长苏都尔巴，回忆了父亲病死在牧主的牛棚里，自己七岁就顶债被抓进了牧主家，在牧主羊圈里长大的血泪史后，无比激动地说：“旧社会，咱贫下中牧的家史，就是‘家死’，老人饿死，小孩冻死，壮年累死。新社会，我们牛羊满坡，定居生活，都是托毛主席的福。毛主席的革命路线是咱贫下中牧的生命线，毛主席的革命路线咱贫下中牧走定了，铁心了，板上钉钉了。谁反对毛主席的革命路线，咱们豁出老命也要和他拚到底！”会后，机枪三连的同志又深入到离开学习班的牧民家里进行访问，同他们一起开展革命大批判，帮助他们提高阶级斗争觉悟，使他们又回到了学习班。
    接着，三连的同志又引导广大贫下中牧狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大摆本大队阶级斗争的形势，一批一摆，问题出来了，阶级敌人暴露了。原来是一个没有改造好的反动牧主，唆使一个坏分子，散布流言蜚语，挑拨军民关系，破坏学习班。随后，就在学习班里，对揭露出来的阶级敌人进行了专题大批判。头一个上了敌人的当离开了学习班的社员阿尔得尼玛，在专题批判会上，指着阶级敌人的鼻子，痛揭了他们妄图阻止贫下中牧学习伟大的毛泽东思想，破坏学习班的罪行。阶级敌人不得不向人民低头认罪，由群众对他们实行了专政。贫下中牧说：“阶级敌人就怕专题批判这一招。”阶级敌人被挖出来了，群众的觉悟提高了，毛泽东思想学习班越办越巩固了。
