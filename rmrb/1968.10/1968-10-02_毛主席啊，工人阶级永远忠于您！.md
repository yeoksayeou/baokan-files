The red sun rises from the east, illuminating the land with golden light.

On October 1st, under a clear blue sky, the nation rejoiced. Our great leader, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, ascended the Tiananmen Gate amidst the majestic melody of "The East Is Red." They stood alongside nearly ten thousand outstanding worker representatives from all over the country and fifty million revolutionary masses from the capital, celebrating the nineteenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The capital city was magnificent and vibrant on this festive day. Our great motherland was ablaze with red, with mountains and forests turning red.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved great victories, turning the entire nation red. Chairman Mao's mighty hand has brought the working class to the forefront of the political stage in all spheres of the superstructure. A magnificent wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation is surging forward.

"Look at the rippling waves of rice and millet." With the efforts of the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—the agricultural production this year is another bumper harvest. The industrial front is reporting continuous victories, ushering in a new leap forward.

"Navigating the vast sea requires a helmsman; revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought."

In this great era, great year, and great day, the representatives of the working class from across the nation and billions of revolutionary people raise their voices in unison, singing with joy. Countless words and melodies converge into the most beautiful wish: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

We wish our great leader, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

The majestic Tiananmen Square is adorned with nine red lanterns hanging in the air. The lanterns bear nine shining golden characters: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The joyous Tiananmen Square is filled with the ranks of the working class, the sole leading class of our country, marching forward in an unending stream. Leading the procession is a towering statue of Mao Zedong, the great teacher of the working class, pointing the way forward. A massive banner reads the same nine shining golden characters: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

On the reviewing stands to the east and west, nearly ten thousand outstanding worker representatives from across the nation gaze up at Chairman Mao's benevolent smile on the Tiananmen Gate, tears of happiness streaming down their faces, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Long live Chairman Mao!" The resounding voice shakes the heavens and echoes through the clouds.

"Long live Chairman Mao!" These nine golden characters are etched in the minds of the working class and imprinted in the hearts of seven hundred million people.

"Long live Chairman Mao!" This most beautiful wish expresses the working class's and billions of revolutionary people's boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the greatest teacher of the working class, the most outstanding representative of the working class. Following you is victory!

On the reviewing stand, the workers from Jiangxi's Anyuan were particularly moved. Wearing the eight-cornered caps that Chairman Mao once wore and pinned with porcelain badges reading "Chairman Mao goes to Anyuan," they joyously shouted towards Chairman Mao on the Tiananmen Gate: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao's towering figure and waving hand evoked their happy memories: In the autumn of 1921, Chairman Mao, full of revolutionary fervor, dressed in a blue gown and carrying a Hunan umbrella, traveled wearily along the railway, step by step, towards Anyuan.

Chairman Mao came! His radiance illuminated the workers' barracks and mines in Anyuan, shining into the hearts of seventeen thousand miners. Under Chairman Mao's personal organization and leadership, the first workers' night school was established in Anyuan, the first batch of party members was developed, the Anyuan Railway and Mining Workers' Club was founded, and the Anyuan Railway and Mining Workers' Strike, which shocked the world, erupted.

Chairman Mao was the savior of the Anyuan workers, the great leader of the working class. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, in an attempt to usurp the credit, portrayed himself as the "leader" of the Anyuan workers' movement, erecting monuments to himself and trying to turn Anyuan into a forward position for his capitalist restoration.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Anyuan workers responded to Chairman Mao's call to "bombard the headquarters," posting the first big-character poster to attack the Chinese Khrushchev in the Pingxiang region. The Chinese Khrushchev's agents in Anyuan brutally suppressed them. In those difficult days, they stood before Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swore: "Beloved Chairman Mao, the soldiers you once led—the Anyuan working class—are determined to live for the defense of your revolutionary line and die for the defense of your revolutionary line! We will not rest until we overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev and eliminate his poisonous influence!" They repeatedly sang, "Looking up at the North Star, thinking of Mao Zedong."

Under the care of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with the support of the working class and Red Guards from across the nation, they fought fiercely and finally seized back the power usurped by the capitalist roaders, achieving victory.

On July 1st, the first batch of revolutionary oil paintings titled "Chairman Mao goes to Anyuan" was sent to Anyuan. The mountains of Anyuan rejoiced, and the Pingxiang River sang. The mines above and below were in a festive mood. On this day, the construction of the "Red Sun Illuminates Anyuan Memorial Hall" began. The Chinese Khrushchev's plot to distort the history of the Anyuan workers' movement was completely foiled!

Nearly ten thousand outstanding worker representatives from major cities and regions across the country brought the joyous news of the great victories of the Cultural Revolution, the rich fruits of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and their most sincere and beautiful feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The workers deeply understood that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved such great victories, and our great motherland is making daily and monthly progress. All of this should be attributed to the great teacher Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Today, Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the invitation of nearly ten thousand worker representatives to Beijing to participate in the national day celebrations. How much trust and care the great teacher Chairman Mao has for the working class! An indescribable sense of great happiness surged through the hearts of each worker representative coming to Beijing, making their hearts swell with emotion.

On the reviewing stand, there was an old worker from Anshan Iron and Steel Company's smelting plant, Zhang Jianxin, who had been fighting at the smelting furnace for eighteen years. Before coming to Beijing, he was a member of the honorable worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, which had just entered the school when he was selected to participate in the capital's national day celebrations. He brought the great news back home that night, and his family was overjoyed. They immediately held a family reminiscence meeting. Zhang Jianxin recalled the hardships he endured in the old society and said excitedly, "We must never forget the well-diggers when we drink water, and we must never forget Chairman Mao when we are happy! Chairman Mao values us workers so much, how can we repay him?" His wife and children unanimously said, "We have nothing else, but you must shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' and 'Long live Chairman Mao!' many times in Beijing." What particularly moved this old worker was that when the delegation was about to leave for Beijing, the military and civilians of Anshan, braving the heavy rain, gave them a grand and enthusiastic send-off. The train started, and the crowd still stood in the rain, waving farewell. When passing through Shenyang, the rain was still pouring. A Little Red Guard ran to the train door in the rain and sincerely saluted, saying, "Uncle worker, when you go to Beijing, please wish Chairman Mao eternal life on behalf of us Little Red Guards!" All of this deeply moved the old worker. Sitting on the speeding train, he thought, I must do two things in Beijing: first, wish Chairman Mao eternal life; second, bring back Chairman Mao's latest instructions and implement them thoroughly.

Li Youqi, an old worker from Shanghai's Hudong Shipyard, never dreamed that he would be approved by the great leader Chairman Mao to come to Beijing to participate in the national day celebrations. After arriving in Beijing, he never imagined that he would live in Zhongnanhai, next to the great leader Chairman Mao. Entering Zhongnanhai, this old worker with twenty-eight years of service could not hold back his tears, and with his hands that had once held hammers, he wrote a poem with deep emotion:

"Workers live in Zhongnanhai, invited by the great leader.
The water in Zhongnanhai is sweet as honey, dripping into my heart.
Workers live in Zhongnanhai, my heart wants to jump out.
Ten thousand words in one sentence, sunflowers forever face the sun."

Isn't this the great voice of the working class across the nation!

The working class ascends the political stage of the superstructure

In the vast ranks of workers, a propaganda team composed mainly of industrial workers, led by the great leader of the working class, Chairman Mao, marched forward, accepting the inspection of the working class's great leader, Chairman Mao.

On the glorious day of July 27th, under the great command of Chairman Mao, they took these firm steps and marched into the educational front, ascending the political stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure.

This is a great event of the 1960s.

This is a great innovation in the history of the proletarian revolution.

With the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, with the People's Liberation Army as a strong backbone, and with the full support of the entire working class, the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, this new thing full of vitality, have taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit across the motherland. Their work is shaking the world.

The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams ascending the political stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure are greatly accelerating the process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The tremendous changes in Tsinghua University over the past two months fully prove this. The biggest change in Tsinghua Garden is that the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao and every battle command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin can be spread to every revolutionary student and staff member of Tsinghua Garden the fastest. From the day the worker propaganda team entered Tsinghua Garden, they spared no effort, day and night, rain or shine, to propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to the revolutionary teachers, students, and workers of the school. The comrades of the worker propaganda team will never forget: On July 27th, Chairman Mao sent them to Tsinghua University; on August 5th, Chairman Mao sent the most precious gift—mangos; on August 15th, Chairman Mao personally received their representatives at the Great Hall of the People and issued the latest instruction: "Our country has a population of seven hundred million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." This is the greatest care and encouragement from the great leader Chairman Mao for the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. This is the happiest day for the working class. They regard these glorious days as the best opportunity to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They spread the news overnight and widely. The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates every corner of Tsinghua Garden. The two formerly irreconcilable factions have now achieved revolutionary unity; the places that used to fight "internal wars" have now become battlefields for revolutionary criticism. Throughout Tsinghua Garden, revolutionary criticism columns are everywhere, and big-character posters exposing class enemies are visible everywhere. In just two months, Tsinghua Garden has ended the situation of endless "internal wars" and launched a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The facts have proven and will continue to prove the great wisdom and correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on "the working class is the leading class," "worker propaganda teams should stay in schools for a long time to participate in all tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and forever lead the schools," etc.

Today, the representatives of the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in Tsinghua University saw the great leader Chairman Mao again on the Tiananmen Gate. They said excitedly, "Every victory we have achieved in Tsinghua Garden is the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, we will ensure that every instruction from Chairman Mao is implemented quickly and smoothly in Tsinghua University and will definitely turn Tsinghua University into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought."

The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering the battlefield of struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure have made class enemies nowhere to hide, and "difficult problems" have been solved.

In Shanghai's No. 64 Middle School, something happened during the early days of the Cultural Revolution: revolutionary youngsters found a package of Kuomintang stamps in a teacher's home, and at that time, no one paid much attention. After the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered the school, they learned about this clue and, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," immediately conducted an analysis and research. Together with the youngsters, they conducted an in-depth investigation and finally exposed a fake county magistrate who had infiltrated the teaching staff. This living reality educated everyone, and soon a high tide of exposing class struggle covers was launched throughout the school. This is how the working class of Shanghai stands firm, distinguishes between love and hate, and uses the perspective of class struggle to observe and analyze everything, exposing the ugly faces of class enemies in broad daylight.

Today, the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters has seven hundred representatives standing by the side of Chairman Mao, accepting the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao. When Chairman Mao warmly waved to them, they thought of forty-seven years ago when Chairman Mao personally came to Shanghai and founded the political party of the working class of our country—the Communist Party of China, leading the working class of our country onto the political stage. Today, Chairman Mao is again leading the working class of our country to occupy the battlefield of struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure, seizing all the positions once occupied by the bourgeoisie. What a magnificent epic this is! They solemnly declared to the great leader Chairman Mao: They will definitely carry forward the spirit of daring to struggle of the working class's "January Revolution," daring to "poke the hornet's nest," daring to "enter the tiger's mouth," daring to "gnaw on hard bones," and resolutely complete the great historical mission entrusted by Chairman Mao.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Students trained in old schools, most or the majority of them can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some have made inventions and creations. However, they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must give them re-education and thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals are welcome by workers, peasants, and soldiers."

The worker representatives on the reviewing stand saw the Red Guards carrying straw hats and holding red Mao Zedong's Little Red Book, carrying the five shining golden characters "Go to the workers and peasants," marching proudly across Tiananmen Square, and their hearts were particularly moved. Looking back at the early and middle stages of the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards' great achievements in smashing the Four Olds, linking up, and overthrowing the bourgeois reactionary line, further aroused their love for the revolutionary youngsters and strengthened their sense of responsibility for re-educating the Red Guards, determined to better complete the glorious task entrusted by Chairman Mao.

The working class must lead everything! This is the necessity of history.

The working class can lead everything! This is the truth of the times.

The strong backing of the working class

The strong backing of the working class—the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces on parade, with deep proletarian feelings for the great commander Chairman Mao, waving red Mao Zedong's Little Red Book, marched proudly through Tiananmen in the resounding shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" accepting Chairman Mao's inspection.

The People's Liberation Army is the most loyal to Chairman Mao and follows Chairman Mao the closest. Over the past year, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers have, in the "three supports, two militaries" work, especially in the joint struggle with the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and vowed to be the strong backbone of the working class, making great contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On the Tiananmen Gate, among the ranks of the People's Liberation Army's reviewing representatives, there was a young soldier, Liu Xuebao, the heroic soldier who defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In early August, when the joyous news of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao presenting precious gifts of mangos to the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the capital arrived, Liu Xuebao, with "only the red sun in my heart, everything dedicated to Chairman Mao," excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" He thought: If I could go to the school with the worker comrades to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, that would be great! That very night, the order came to transfer Liu Xuebao to participate in the worker propaganda team training class organized by the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee. This joy upon joy news made Liu Xuebao so excited that he couldn't sleep all night.

Liu Xuebao, born into a poor peasant family, clearly understood that the working class ascending the political stage of the superstructure is a more profound class struggle. In the two training classes that have already been held, Liu Xuebao, together with the workers, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, shared his experiences in supporting the left in fighting against class enemies, collected the bitter family histories of old workers as living teaching materials, and armed the worker propaganda teams with Mao Zedong Thought.

In the parade, the comrades of the unit stationed at Peking University, together with the worker comrades and Red Guards, marched proudly through Tiananmen, accepting the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao. The soldiers gazed up at Chairman Mao's benevolent face, their hearts surging with emotion and blood boiling. From the moment the worker propaganda team entered Peking University, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "fully playing the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," treating respecting, supporting, and defending the leadership of the working class as their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. When they first entered Peking University, a small group of class enemies stirred up trouble, inciting students against the worker propaganda team. The comrades immediately stepped forward, spreading the great role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution, lecturing on the principles that the working class must lead everything and can lead everything, and mobilizing revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to criticize various rumors, quickly smashing the class enemies' evil plots and firmly defending the authority of the working class.

Li Wenzhong's former comrades-in-arms, the political instructor of the sixth company of a certain unit, Ji Ruihua, was particularly moved today. This was his first time participating in the national day celebrations, and he saw our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao. This is the happiest day he will never forget in his life.

Recently, the sixth company where Li Wenzhong was stationed carried out leftist support tasks in the Hongdu Machinery Factory in Nanchang. When the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin issued the great command for the worker propaganda teams to enter the schools, the sixth company, taking Li Wenzhong as an example, immediately dispatched some personnel to enter the Jiangxi Institute of Technology with the Hongdu Machinery Factory worker propaganda team. The heroic fourth platoon left in the Hongdu Machinery Factory to carry out leftist support tasks regarded the combination of revolution and production as the greatest support for the worker propaganda team. They helped a relatively backward workshop combine revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, combining "daily reading" with the class struggle realities of the workshop, launching a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against a small group of class enemies, exposing a small group of class enemies who attempted to sabotage the combination of revolution and production, and quickly changing the backward face of the workshop. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the active help of the comrades of the sixth company, the revolutionary struggle in the Hongdu Machinery Factory was carried out vigorously, and production was booming. The comrades of the Hongdu Machinery Factory worker propaganda team stationed in the Jiangxi Institute of Technology said, "With our factory as the rear base and the People's Liberation Army as our strong backing, we are a thousand times and ten thousand times more at ease, and we will not rest until we carry out the educational revolution in the school to the end."

The comrades of the units of the worker propaganda teams from various places, in the days of fighting side by side with the worker comrades, humbly learned from the worker masses and brought the experiences of the People's Liberation Army's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, promoting the three-eighths style, developing the three democracies, and carrying out the four-good platoon movement into the propaganda teams. The comrades of the units stationed in the Dalian Institute of Technology and the worker comrades, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "carrying out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," carried out the "one helps one, one pairs with one" activity with the Red Guards, educating the Red Guards to overcome their shortcomings, develop their advantages, and unite against the enemy. With the help of the comrades of the units, the worker propaganda teams in various places carried out the "four-good platoon" and "five-good soldier" activities, using the effective experience of the "small rectification" of the units, studying Chairman Mao's works with problems, promoting ideological revolutionization, and earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction of "the working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle."

The working class leads the way in struggle, criticism, and transformation

"Establish revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination, carry out big criticism, clean up class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, and transfer office personnel. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories generally go through these stages."

The billion military and civilian people across the nation respond to the battle command of the great leader Chairman Mao, advancing victoriously. A great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation is surging across the nation. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has entered a new period.

On Tiananmen Square, the vast army of workers, peasants, and soldiers, holding high the giant banners of "the working class must lead everything" and "carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation seriously," marched forward.

The great, fighting working class of China, with the high sense of revolutionary responsibility and grandeur of the leading class, leads the way in struggle, criticism, and transformation. They have the deepest proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and are the most resolute in implementing Chairman Mao's battle commands.

The representatives of the revolutionary workers from the Guiyang Cotton Mill, Beijing Knitting Factory, Beijing New China Printing Factory, and Shanghai Machine Tool Factory today happily ascended the Tiananmen Gate. These factories are shining examples of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Their successful experiences have stirred up waves across the nation, becoming a powerful force driving the wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Learn from the Guiyang Cotton Mill! Learn from the Beijing Knitting Factory! Learn from the Beijing New China Printing Factory! Follow the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory! This has become the action slogan of the broad revolutionary masses.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory marching in the parade are the closest to Chairman Mao and firmly believe in Mao Zedong Thought. When Chairman Mao called for carrying out revolutionary criticism, the entire factory became a battlefield, and the broad revolutionary workers denounced and criticized with their mouths and pens, submerging a small group of class enemies in the vast sea of people's war. The reactionary revisionist line was criticized to the point of being unrecognizable and stinking.

They are the most loyal to Chairman Mao and the most resolute in executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions without distortion. In the work of cleansing class ranks, they seriously studied and grasped Chairman Mao's series of policies on the struggle against enemies, striking a small group of class enemies steadily, accurately, and fiercely, summarizing the good experience of strengthening leadership, firmly grasping the policy, grasping active thoughts, fighting heart battles, doing good work with family members, and turning resistance into motivation.

The rectification of the party has begun. They actively opened party member study classes, inviting the masses to participate, studying Mao Zedong's proletarian party-building line, and fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist party-building line. Three party members in the garment workshop, holding high Chairman Mao's portrait and holding red Mao Zedong's Little Red Book, visited hundreds of workers in half a month to solicit opinions, strengthening the party-mass relationship and promoting the smooth progress of the rectification work.

They are thorough in their revolutionary spirit. After one round of streamlining organizations was not thorough, they carried out a second round, resolutely following the path of Lingbao County's streamlining and reducing personnel. The number of personnel at the factory level was reduced from over two hundred to about thirty. The three-level management was changed to two-level management. The workshop leadership team participated in labor. The revolutionary committee of the factory truly possessed the unparalleled superiority of a small leadership team, few administrative personnel, a strong and vigorous team, and close ties with the masses.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation seriously," the workers of the Shanghai Dongfanghong Shipyard were the first to break into the inspection department with a sign reading "no entry for outsiders," conducting extensive and in-depth investigations. Seven "rough-handed" workers from the casting and forging workshop used the method of class analysis to deeply expose the evil tendency of this technical stronghold to detach from proletarian politics, production practice, and the worker masses, writing a report with materials, viewpoints, and full of proletarian feelings, powerfully criticizing the revisionist enterprise line. Their revolutionary initiative inspired the entire factory, and within two days, sixty-one worker investigation teams appeared, conducting extensive and in-depth investigations of all departments, various regulations, and various problems in the entire factory, writing dozens of weighty investigation reports. The power of struggle, criticism, and transformation truly fell into the hands of the worker masses, and the mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation was both vigorous and solid.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against class enemies."

Chairman Mao's instructions are the great guideline for party rectification and building.

The working class resolutely responds to Chairman Mao's call, determined to build the party organization into a leadership core that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and resolutely executes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A batch of advanced factories and mines are placing party rectification and building in a very important position during the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The invincible working class armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought is unstoppable. Under the leadership of the working class, the revolutionary people of the entire nation have united into a vast revolutionary army, closely rallying around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unifying their understanding, policies, steps, and actions according to Mao Zedong Thought, and striving forward to complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation!

Long live the working class of China! Long live the great leader of the working class, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

专栏：

    毛主席啊，工人阶级永远忠于您！
    红日从东方升起，金光普照大地。
    十月一日，晴空万里，举国欢腾。我们伟大的领袖，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中，健步登上了天安门城楼，同来自全国各地的近万名优秀工人代表以及首都五十万革命群众一道，欢庆伟大的中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    节日的首都，气象万千，分外壮丽。伟大的祖国，“万山红遍，层林尽染”。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的胜利，实现了全国山河一片红。毛主席挥巨手，工人阶级主力军登上了上层建筑各个领域的政治舞台。一个波澜壮阔的斗、批、改高潮，正在蓬勃兴起。
    “喜看稻菽千重浪”。在工人阶级最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农的努力下，今年的农业生产，又是一个丰收年景。工业战线捷报频传，出现了新的跃进局面。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    在这大好形势、大好年景、大喜日子里，全国工人阶级的代表和亿万革命人民同声欢呼，纵情歌唱。千言万语，千歌万曲，凝结成世界上最美好的祝愿：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    敬祝工人阶级的伟大  领袖毛主席万寿无疆
    雄伟的天安门广场，凌空高悬着九个红灯。红灯上写着九个金光闪闪的大字：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    欢腾的天安门广场上，我国唯一的领导阶级——工人阶级的队伍，浩浩荡荡地行进。游行队伍的前导是工人阶级的伟大导师毛主席的高大塑像，挥手指向前方。巨大的横标上，同样写着九个金光闪闪的大字：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    东西观礼台上，来自全国各地的近万名优秀工人代表，仰望着天安门城楼上毛主席慈祥的笑容，含着幸福的热泪，一遍又一遍地欢呼：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    “敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”这个宏亮的声音，震天撼地，响彻云霄。
    “敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”这九个金色的大字，刻在工人阶级的脑海里，印在七亿人民的心坎上。
    “敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”这个最美好的祝愿，表达了工人阶级和亿万革命人民对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是工人阶级最伟大的导师，您是工人阶级最杰出的代表。跟着您，就是胜利！
    观礼台上，从江西安源来的工人代表心情格外激动。他们头戴毛主席当年戴过的八角帽，胸佩“毛主席去安源”的瓷质像章，向着天安门城楼上的毛主席纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”毛主席高大的身躯，挥动的巨手，唤起他们幸福的回想：一九二一年秋，毛主席满怀革命豪情，身穿蓝布长衫，手拿湖南雨伞，风尘仆仆，沿着铁路一步一步地走向安源。
    毛主席来了！毛主席的光辉照亮了安源的工棚、矿井，照亮了安源一万七千路矿工人的心。在毛主席亲自组织、领导下，安源办起了第一所工人夜校，发展了第一批党员，建立了安源路矿工人俱乐部，爆发了震惊中外的安源路矿工人大罢工。
    毛主席是安源工人的大救星，毛主席是工人阶级的伟大领袖。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却贪天之功，把自己打扮成安源工运的“领袖”，为自己树碑立传，妄图把安源变成他复辟资本主义的前哨阵地。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，安源工人响应毛主席“炮打司令部”的伟大号召，在萍乡地区，贴出了第一张炮打中国赫鲁晓夫的大字报。中国赫鲁晓夫在安源的代理人，对他们进行残酷的镇压。在困难的日子里，他们面对毛主席的画像庄严宣誓：“敬爱的毛主席，您老人家带过的兵——安源工人阶级，决心为保卫您的革命路线而生，为保卫您的革命路线而死！不打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，不肃清他的流毒死不瞑目！”一遍又一遍地高唱：“抬头望见北斗星，心中想念毛泽东。”
    在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的关怀下，在全国工人阶级和红卫兵小将的支援下，他们经过了反复剧烈的搏斗，终于夺回了被走资派篡夺的大权，取得了胜利。
    七月一日，第一批《毛主席去安源》的革命油画送到安源。安源山在欢呼，萍水河在歌唱。矿井上下，一片欢腾。就在这一天，“红太阳照亮安源纪念馆”开始兴建。中国赫鲁晓夫篡改安源工人运动历史的阴谋彻底破产了！
    来自全国各大城市和各地区的近万名优秀工人代表，带来了文化大革命伟大胜利的喜讯，带来了斗、批、改的丰硕成果，带来了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的最真挚、最美好的感情。工人们深深懂得：无产阶级文化大革命取得这样伟大的胜利，我们伟大祖国这样日新月异，蒸蒸日上。这一切的一切，都应该归功于伟大导师毛主席，归功于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。今天，毛主席和林副主席又亲自批准邀请近万名工人代表来北京参加国庆观礼，伟大导师毛主席对工人阶级多么信任和关怀啊！一种难以形容的巨大的幸福感，使每个来京的工人代表，心潮澎湃，万分激动。
    在观礼台上，有一名来自鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂的老工人张建新，他已经在炼铁炉旁整整战斗了十八年。这次来北京以前，他作为工人毛泽东思想宣传队的一个光荣的队员，刚刚开进学校不久，就被推选为参加首都国庆观礼的代表。他把这一特大喜讯连夜带回家去，一家人更是欣喜若狂，立即召开了家庭忆苦思甜会。张建新回忆了他在旧社会所受的苦，激动地说：“咱们吃水不忘打井人，幸福不忘毛主席！毛主席这样看重咱工人阶级，咱们拿什么来报答他老人家呢？”老伴和孩子们异口同声地说：“咱们没有别的，你上北京要多喊几声‘毛主席万岁！’‘敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！’”尤其使这位老工人不能平静的是，当观礼代表团临来北京时，鞍山市军民，冒着大雨，隆重热烈的夹道欢送。火车开动了，欢送的人群还站在雨地里不停地挥手致意。路过沈阳市时，雨仍然下个不停。一个红小兵冒雨跑到车门口来，非常真诚地敬了个礼说：“工人叔叔，你们到北京，一定要替咱红小兵祝福毛主席万寿无疆！”所有这些，都使这位老工人十分感动。他坐在飞驰的列车上，一路盘算着，我到北京一定要做好两件事：第一件事就是敬祝毛主席万寿无疆；第二件事就是把毛主席的最新指示带回来，条条落实，全面落实。
    上海沪东造船厂老工人李有其，做梦也没有想到自己会被伟大领袖毛主席批准邀请来北京参加国庆观礼。来到北京以后，更没有想到会住进中南海、住到伟大领袖毛主席的身边。进了中南海，这位有二十八年工龄的老工人，止不住热泪盈眶，用他握过铁锤的手，无限深情地写了一首诗：
    “工人住进中南海，伟大领袖邀请来。
    中南海水甜如蜜，点点滴滴入心怀。
    工人住进中南海，激动的心要跳出来。
    千言万语并一句，葵花永远向阳开。”
    这两位产业工人所表达的，不正是全国工人阶级伟大的心声吗！
    工人阶级登上  上层建筑政治舞台
    在浩浩荡荡的工人队伍里，一支以产业工人为主体的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，昂首阔步地在前进，接受工人阶级的伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。
    在今年七月二十七日这个光辉的日子里，他们在毛主席的伟大号令下，就是踏着这样坚定的步伐，雄赳赳、气昂昂地开进了教育阵地，登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的政治舞台。
    这是二十世纪六十年代的伟大事件。
    这是无产阶级革命史上的伟大创举。
    有以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导，有中国人民解放军作坚强的后盾，有整个工人阶级的全力支援，工人毛泽东思想宣传队这一具有无限生命力的新生事物，已经在祖国的大地上，生根、开花、结果。他们的工作正在震动全世界。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队登上上层建筑斗、批、改的政治舞台，正在大大加速无产阶级文化大革命的进程。清华大学近两个月中所起的翻天覆地的变化，充分证明了这一点。清华园的最大变化，就是伟大领袖毛主席的声音和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，都能最迅速地传播到清华园全体革命学生和教职员工中去。从工人宣传队进入清华园的第一天起，他们就不管白天黑夜，不管风里雨里，尽最大努力向革命师生和学校的工人，宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席一系列最新指示。工人宣传队的同志们永远难忘的是：七月二十七日，毛主席派他们进驻清华大学；八月五日，毛主席就派人送来了最珍贵的礼物——芒果；八月十五日，毛主席亲自在人民大会堂接见了他们的代表，并且发表了“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”的最新指示。这是伟大领袖毛主席对工人毛泽东思想宣传队的最大关怀和最大鼓舞。这是工人阶级最幸福的节日。他们把这些光辉的日子，看成是宣传和落实毛主席最新指示的最好时机。他们连夜传达，广为宣传。毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光照亮了清华园的每一个角落。过去势不两立的两大派组织，如今实现了革命的大联合；过去打“内战”的地方，如今变成了革命大批判的战场。整个清华园内，革命大批判专栏琳琅满目，揭露阶级敌人的大字报到处可见。短短两个月，清华园已经结束“内战”不休的局面，掀起了伟大的斗、批、改热潮。事实已经证明并将继续证明伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级是领导阶级”、“工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校”等一系列最新指示的无比英明，无比正确。
    今天，首都驻清华大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队的代表，在天安门城楼上又一次见到了伟大领袖毛主席。他们无比激动地说：“我们在清华园的每一个胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。今后，我们坚决保证毛主席的每一个指示，都能在清华大学迅速地、畅通地贯彻执行，一定把清华大学办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。”
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进入上层建筑斗、批、改的阵地，锋芒所向，阶级敌人无处藏身，“老大难”问题迎刃而解。
    在上海第六十四中学曾经发生过这样一件事：文化大革命初期，这个学校的革命小将在一个教师家里发现了一包美蒋邮票，当时大家没有当回事情。工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校以后，了解到这一线索，按照毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，立即进行了分析研究，和小将们一起，经过深入调查，终于把这个混进教师队伍里的伪县长揪了出来。活生生的现实，教育了大家，很快就在全校掀起了大揭阶级斗争盖子的高潮。上海的工人阶级就是这样立场坚定，爱憎分明，处处用阶级斗争的观点观察一切，分析一切，使阶级敌人的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下。
    今天，上海工人革命造反总司令部，有七百名代表来到了毛主席身边，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。当毛主席亲切地向他们招手的时候，他们想起了四十七年前，毛主席亲自来到上海，缔造了我国工人阶级的政党——中国共产党，率领我国工人阶级走上了政治舞台。今天，毛主席又指引我国工人阶级去占领上层建筑斗、批、改的阵地，把资产阶级老爷们盘踞的一切地盘夺过来。这是一部多么壮丽的史诗啊！他们庄严地向伟大领袖毛主席宣誓：一定发扬工人阶级敢于斗争的“一月革命”精神，敢捅“马蜂窝”，敢钻“老虎口”，敢啃“硬骨头”，坚决完成毛主席交给的伟大历史使命。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”
    站在观礼台上的工人代表，看到身背草帽，手拿红彤彤《毛主席语录》的红卫兵队伍，抬着“到工农中去”五个金光闪闪的大字，飒爽英姿地走过天安门广场的时候，心情特别激动。回顾文化大革命初期和中期，红卫兵小将们大破四旧，点火串连，大造资产阶级反动路线的反所立下的丰功伟绩，更加激起了他们对革命小将的热爱，更加增强了他们对红卫兵进行再教育的巨大责任感，决心更好地完成毛主席交给的这一光荣任务。
    工人阶级必须领导一切！这是历史的必然。
    工人阶级能够领导一切！这是时代的真理。
    工人阶级的强大后盾
    工人阶级的强大后盾——中国人民解放军陆、海、空三军受阅部队，怀着对伟大统帅毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，在“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声中威武雄壮地通过天安门，接受毛主席的检阅。
    人民解放军对毛主席最忠，跟毛主席最紧。一年来，广大指战员在“三支”“两军”工作中，特别是在与工人毛泽东思想宣传队的共同战斗中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的最新指示，誓做工人阶级的坚强后盾，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，做出了巨大的贡献。
    在天安门城楼上，解放军观礼代表的行列里，有一位年轻战士，他就是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的英雄战士刘学保。
    八月初，当我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席向首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队赠送珍贵礼物芒果的特大喜讯传来，“心中唯有红太阳，一切献给毛主席”的刘学保，激动地一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”他心里想：如果我能够和工人同志一起到学校去落实毛主席的最新指示，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，那该多么好啊！就在这天晚上，上级来了通知，调刘学保参加甘肃省革委会组织的工人宣传队训练班。这个喜上加喜的消息，使刘学保兴奋得一夜没睡觉。
    贫农出身的刘学保，凭着他对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，清楚地认识到，工人阶级登上上层建筑的政治舞台，是一场更加深刻的阶级斗争。在已经举办的两期工人宣传队训练班里，刘学保和工人一起，学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导，介绍自己在支左中同阶级敌人斗争的经验，搜集老工人在旧社会的苦难家史当活教材，用毛泽东思想武装工人宣传队。
    游行队伍里，驻北京大学工人宣传队的部队同志，同工人同志和红卫兵小将一道，迈着雄健的步伐，走过了天安门，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。指战员们仰望着毛主席慈祥的面容，心潮翻滚，热血沸腾。工人宣传队在进驻北京大学的短短时间内，遵照毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的教导，把尊重、支持和维护工人阶级的领导，看作是对毛主席和毛主席革命路线的无限忠诚。刚进北京大学的时候，一小撮阶级敌人兴妖作怪，挑拨学生与工人宣传队的关系。部队同志当即挺身而出，大摆工人阶级在文化大革命中的伟大作用，大讲工人阶级必须领导一切、能够领导一切的道理，并且发动革命师生员工，痛击各种流言蜚语，很快就粉碎了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，坚定地捍卫了工人阶级的领导权威。
    李文忠生前的战友，某部六连指导员纪瑞华，今天心情格外激动。他第一次参加国庆观礼，见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。这是他终生难忘的最幸福的日子。
    最近，李文忠生前所在的六连，在南昌市洪都机械厂执行支左任务，当以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出工人宣传队进驻学校的伟大号令时，六连以英雄李文忠为榜样，立即抽调部分人员和洪都机械厂工人宣传队一起开进了江西工学院。留在洪都机械厂执行支左任务的英雄四排，把抓好革命、促好生产看作是对工人宣传队最大的支持。他们帮助一个比较落后的车间把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来，把“天天读”和本车间的阶级斗争实际结合起来，对一小撮阶级敌人进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争，揪出了妄图破坏抓革命、促生产的一小撮阶级敌人，迅速改变了这个车间的落后面貌。在毛泽东思想的指引下，在六连同志的积极帮助下，洪都机械厂的革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。进驻江西工学院的洪都机械厂的工人宣传队的同志们说：“有我们的工厂做大后方，有解放军做我们的强大后盾，我们一千个一万个放心，不把学校的教育革命进行到底誓不罢休。”
    各地工人宣传队的部队同志，在与工人同志并肩战斗的日子里，虚心向工人群众学习，同时又把解放军活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动的经验带进宣传队。进驻大连工学院的部队同志和工人同志，遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，和红卫兵小将开展了“一帮一、一对红”活动，教育红卫兵小将克服缺点，发扬优点，共同对敌。在部队同志的帮助下，各地工人宣传队开展了“四好连队”、“五好战士”活动，运用部队行之有效的“小整风”的经验，带着问题学习毛主席著作，促进思想革命化，认真地落实了毛主席关于“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的伟大指示。
    工人阶级走在斗批改的最前列
    “建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”
    全国亿万军民响应伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号令，乘胜前进。一个伟大的斗、批、改高潮，正在全国蓬勃兴起。我国无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新的时期。
    天安门广场上，浩浩荡荡的工农兵大军，高举着“工人阶级必须领导一切”、“认真搞好斗、批、改”的巨幅标语，阔步前进。
    伟大的、战斗的中国工人阶级，以领导阶级的高度革命责任感和豪迈气魄，走在斗、批、改的最前列。他们对毛主席的无产阶级感情最深厚，贯彻执行毛主席的战斗号令最坚决。
    贵阳棉纺厂、北京针织总厂、北京新华印刷厂、上海机床厂革命工人的代表，今天幸福地登上了天安门城楼。这些工厂是斗、批、改的光辉榜样。他们的成功经验在全国激起了巨浪，变成了推动斗、批、改高潮的强大力量。学习贵阳棉纺厂！学习北京针织总厂！学习北京新华印刷厂！走上海机床厂的道路！现在已成为广大革命群众的行动口号。
    走在游行队伍中的北京针织总厂革命工人，对毛主席最亲，对毛泽东思想坚信不疑。毛主席号召开展革命大批判，全厂处处摆战场，广大革命职工口诛笔伐，一小撮阶级敌人陷入了“人民战争”的汪洋大海，反革命修正主义路线被批得体无完肤，臭不可闻。
    他们对毛主席最忠，执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最坚决，落实毛主席的最新指示不走样。在清理阶级队伍的工作中，他们认真学习、掌握毛主席历来关于对敌斗争的一系列的方针政策，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，总结出了加强领导，狠把政策关；抓好活思想，打好攻心战；做好家属工作，变阻力为动力的好经验。
    整党开始了。他们积极开办党员学习班，吸收群众参加，大学毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义建党路线。成衣车间三个党员，高举毛主席画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，半个月内，走访几百个工人征求意见，密切了党群关系，促进了整党工作的顺利开展。
    他们富于革命的彻底性。精简机构一次不彻底，又搞了第二次，坚决走灵宝县精兵简政的道路。厂一级的工作人员由二百多人减少到三十来人。三级管理改为两级管理。车间领导班子跟班参加劳动。厂革委会真正具有领导班子小，办事人员少，精悍有力，朝气蓬勃，密切联系群众的无比优越性。
    毛主席发出“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大号召以后，上海东方红造船厂工人首先闯进了挂着“闲人莫入”牌子的检验科，大搞调查研究。铸锻车间的七个“粗手粗脚”的工人，用阶级分析的方法，深刻揭露了这个技术禁地脱离无产阶级政治、脱离生产实践、脱离工人群众的恶劣倾向，写出一份有材料、有观点、充满着无产阶级感情的调查报告，有力地批判了修正主义企业路线。他们的革命创举带动了全厂，两天之内就出现了六十一个工人调查小组，对全厂所有部门、各种规章制度和各种问题，进行了广泛深入的调查，写出了几十份有分量的调查报告。斗、批、改大权真正掌握在工人群众手里，斗、批、改的群众运动既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实。
    毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”
    毛主席的指示是整党建党的伟大纲领。
    工人阶级坚决响应毛主席的号召，决心把党组织建设成为无限忠于毛主席、坚决执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的领导核心。一批先进厂矿，在斗、批、改中正在把整党、建党放到非常重要的地位。
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，所向披靡。在工人阶级的领导下，全国革命人民汇成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，按照毛泽东思想统一认识，统一政策，统一步伐，统一行动，为胜利完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务，奋勇前进！
    中国工人阶级万岁！工人阶级的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
