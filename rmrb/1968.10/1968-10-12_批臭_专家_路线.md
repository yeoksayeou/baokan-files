In the past, the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev held power in our factory and faithfully implemented the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line of "experts managing the factory." They attempted to develop a new type of battery, not trusting the worker masses, relying on a few technical "authorities," working in isolation, and promoting mystification. In the end, they all failed. Some of them conducted research for a year and declared it "impossible to produce," leading to scrapping. We workers saw this with our own eyes and were so angry that our lungs nearly burst.

In August 1967, our factory was tasked with developing a new type of battery. This task was quite challenging. A "technical engineer" who had been researching batteries for over fifty years thought it was impossible and refused to participate. At this time, the factory revolutionary committee, with the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "hold study classes, which is a good method." They first organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, attended by workers, revolutionary cadres, and technical personnel. In the class, they fiercely criticized the revisionist "expert" line and slavish thinking promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, further raising everyone's class struggle and line struggle consciousness, and building confidence. The workers said, "If foreigners can produce it, we can definitely produce it too." "Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We are determined to produce this new type of battery to counter the attacks and slanders of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries against our country." Young technicians, under the education of the working class, fought against their selfish thoughts and decided to be students of the working class, contributing to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Developing this new type of battery faced many difficulties, with no data, drawings, or equipment. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's teachings on "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with our enemies, the determination to restore our old glory based on self-reliance, and the ability to stand independently among the nations of the world," we discarded the "foreign frameworks" and "foreign doctrines" that hindered us and forged our own path. In the development process, we used the brilliant thoughts of "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" as weapons, analyzed contradictions, and guided every stage of work. For example, we proposed different battery compositions and conducted repeated experiments. From practice, we discovered laws and finally found the most satisfactory battery composition, achieving good battery performance. With no data, workers relied on their rich experience accumulated from production practice and combined with technical personnel, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, jointly researching and boldly exploring. With no drawings, we drew them as we worked. Workers were technical personnel, and technical personnel were also workers. Workers participated in design, and technical personnel also engaged in manufacturing. Everyone contributed ideas and efforts. For what kind of mold to make, workers and technical personnel studied together and finally determined the manufacturing plan, smashing the shackles that constrained workers' wisdom and establishing the leading position of the working class. In the development process, we encountered the problem of batteries being sensitive to alkali, which was the biggest challenge. To overcome this difficulty, we needed a piece of equipment. The factory did not have this equipment, but this did not deter us. Everyone followed Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and hard struggle, creating this equipment ourselves and solving the problem of batteries being sensitive to alkali. After a month and five days of hard work, we successfully developed this advanced new type of battery. This battery is small in size, large in capacity, and low in cost, filling a gap in China's chemical power sources.

After the successful development of the new type of battery, a research institution sent dozens of people to visit. They deeply felt, "We are researchers of chemical power sources and didn't even dare to think about it." That "engineer" also had to admit defeat in the face of facts. He muttered to himself, "This is a resounding slap in the face."

Facts have proven that the most intelligent and talented are the warriors with the most practical experience. The Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has limitless creativity and the ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level. The revisionist expert line of the Chinese Khrushchev must be smashed.

    批臭“专家”路线
    天津干电池厂试制新型产品“三忠于”学习班
    过去，中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人把持了我厂的大权，忠实地执行中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的修正主义路线。他们试制新型的蓄电池，不相信工人群众，依靠一些技术“权威”，闭门造车，大搞神秘化，最后一个个都失败了。他们有的研究了一年，竟宣告“不可造”，而报废。我们工人阶级看在眼里，肺都气炸了。
    一九六七年八月，我厂接受试制一种新型的蓄电池任务。这项任务比较艰巨，一位研究五十多年电池的“工程师”，认为不可能搞出来，甩手不干。这时，厂革委会在驻厂解放军的帮助下，遵循毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法”的教导，首先举办了有工人、革命领导干部、技术干部参加的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的修正主义的专家路线、洋奴思想，进一步地提高大家的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，树立了信心。工人说：“外国能造出来，我们也一定能造出来。”“毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气，决心制造出新型蓄电池来，回击帝修反对我国的攻击和诬蔑。”年青的技术员在工人阶级的教育下，狠斗私心，决心当工人阶级的小学生，为无产阶级革命事业贡献力量。
    试制这种新型蓄电池，没有资料，没有图纸，没有设备，困难不少。在毛主席关于“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力”的教导鼓舞下，我们抛开“洋框框”、“洋教条”这些绊脚石，走自己的路。在试制过程中，我们以《矛盾论》、《实践论》的光辉思想为武器，分析矛盾，指导每一段工作。比如拟出不同种的电池配比，进行反复试验，从实践中发现规律，最后找出一种最满意的电池配比，得到较好的电池性能。没有资料，工人就凭着在生产实践中积累起来的丰富经验，和技术人员相结合，以毛泽东思想为武器，共同研究，大胆摸索。没有图纸，一边干，一边画图纸。工人就是技术员，技术员也是工人，工人参加设计，技术人员也动手制作，大家群策群力。要做什么样的模具，都是工人与技术人员一起研究，最后确定制作方案，砸烂那种束缚工人智慧的枷锁，确立了工人阶级的领导地位。在试制工作中，遇到了电池怕碱的现象，这是电池上的最大难关。为了攻克这道难关，必须有一种设备。厂里没有这种设备，但这并没有难倒我们。大家遵循毛主席关于自力更生，艰苦奋斗的教导，自己动手创造这种设备，解决了电池怕碱的问题。经过了一个月零五天的奋战，就把这种具有先进水平的新型蓄电池试制成功了。这种蓄电池的体积小，容量大，成本低，为我国化学电源填补了空白点。
    新型蓄电池试制成功后，一个研究机关来了几十个人参观。他们深有感触地说：“我们是研究化学电源的，连想也不敢想。”那位“工程师”也在事实面前，不得不认输。他自言自语地说：“这是给我一个响亮的耳光。”
    事实证明，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，有无限的创造力，有能力赶上和超过世界先进水平。中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义专家路线必须砸烂。
