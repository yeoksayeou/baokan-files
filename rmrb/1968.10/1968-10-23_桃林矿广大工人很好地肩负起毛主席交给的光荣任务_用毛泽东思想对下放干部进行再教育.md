The workers of Taolin Mine in Hunan Province have made initial achievements in warmly helping and patiently re-educating cadre sent down to labor in production teams.

Since July this year, Taolin Mine has sent down office personnel, and now most of the original office cadre have been sent down to production teams to participate in labor. Over the past two months, under the care and help of the worker masses, the spiritual outlook of most cadre has changed significantly. Many cadre say, "Two months of being sent down is worth more than ten years of study. The worker masses are our best teachers."

When the mine began sending down office personnel, the revolutionary committee organized the worker masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's statements and series of latest instructions on cadre issues, raising everyone's understanding of the significance of sending down cadre. The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "fully playing the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work" and on intellectuals accepting re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers further aroused the sense of responsibility of the worker masses throughout the mine. They said, "We must shoulder the glorious responsibility entrusted to us by Chairman Mao to re-educate intellectuals. We must not only send down office cadre but, more importantly, use Mao Zedong Thought to 'bring them out,' helping them to thoroughly change their old ideas and establish a proletarian worldview through labor and by combining with the worker masses."

The worker masses of this mine recommended outstanding members from their ranks to specifically help the cadre sent down. Many veteran workers took the initiative to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with the cadre, making it the first lesson in re-educating the cadre sent down. They also, according to the characteristics of each cadre sent down, paid attention to conducting class education for them at any time, helping the cadre to raise their class consciousness. They warmly welcomed every bit of progress made by the cadre sent down, sincerely and seriously criticized the shortcomings of the cadre, and at the same time warmly helped the cadre to overcome practical difficulties in production labor. One cadre, in the process of streamlining personnel, was sent down to the construction site. Because he did not fully understand the significance of being sent down to labor, he would leave after working eight hours a day and would not get close to the workers. The workers felt that this cadre came from a working-class family. After Chairman Mao led the working people to stand up and be liberated, he went to university and became a cadre. However, due to the poisoning of the revisionist educational line, he had long been separated from labor and the masses. Therefore, through class education, they aroused his awareness, making him realize his mistakes. From then on, this cadre changed greatly and quickly became one with the workers. Recently, he was even elected by the workers as the deputy director of the production technology democratic management committee. Many cadre sent down, like this cadre, in the fiery class struggle and collective labor, under the warm help of the worker masses, continuously raised their political consciousness.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "A large number of cadre sent down to labor, this is a good opportunity for cadre to re-learn, except for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. Cadre in office should also be sent down to labor in batches," the revolutionary committee immediately organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class for the cadre sent down, with the participation of the worker masses, to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, summarizing the gains and experiences in labor and in combining with the worker masses. In the study class, the worker masses fully affirmed the achievements of the cadre sent down, and at the same time, based on some active thoughts in the process of being sent down, they provided patient and detailed help. Through study and summary, the broad cadre's understanding has been further raised. They said, "We have taken the right path. We must follow the bright road pointed out by Chairman Mao to the end, combine with the workers for life, and transform our thoughts for life."

In Jilin Province, Dongfeng County, various levels of cadre, following Chairman Mao's great teachings of "being both an official and a common person," actively and voluntarily went down to the countryside to participate in labor, consciously accepting re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, and continuously promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts. The picture shows the original county-level organ cadre sent down to Huangnijiang Commune working with poor and lower-middle peasants to build terraces and carry out basic farmland construction.

### 桃林矿广大工人很好地肩负起毛主席交给的光荣任务  用毛泽东思想对下放干部进行再教育

    桃林矿广大工人很好地肩负起毛主席交给的光荣任务
    用毛泽东思想对下放干部进行再教育
    许多老工人和下放干部一道学习《为人民服务》，随时对他们进行阶级教育。在工人群众的亲切帮助下，下放干部的政治觉悟不断提高
    新华社长沙二十二日电　湖南省桃林矿广大产业工人，对下放劳动的科室干部进行热情的帮助和耐心的再教育取得了初步成绩。
    桃林矿从今年七月份开始下放科室人员，现在绝大部分原科室干部都已下放到生产班组参加劳动。两个多月来，他们在工人群众的关怀和帮助下，多数人的精神面貌发生了显著变化。许多干部说：“下放两个月，胜读十年书，工人群众是我们最好的老师。”
    桃林矿革委会在开始下放科室人员时，就组织工人群众反复学习毛主席有关干部问题的论述和一系列最新指示，提高了大家对下放干部的意义的认识。毛主席关于“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”和知识分子要接受工农兵再教育的最新指示的发表，更加激发了全矿工人群众的责任感。他们说，我们一定要很好地担负起毛主席交给我们的对知识分子进行再教育的光荣责任，不但要把科室干部放下去，而且更重要的是要用毛泽东思想把他们“教出来”，帮助他们在劳动中，在同工人群众的结合中彻底改变旧思想，树立无产阶级的世界观。
    这个矿的工人群众，把自己队伍中的优秀分子推荐出来，对下放干部进行具体帮助。许多老工人把同干部一道学习毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》，当作对下放干部进行再教育的第一课。他们还根据每个下放干部的特点，随时注意向下放干部进行阶级教育，帮助干部提高阶级觉悟。他们热情欢迎下放干部的每一点进步，严肃而诚恳地批评干部的缺点，同时热情地帮助干部们克服生产劳动中的实际困难。有个干部在精兵简政中随大流下到工地，由于他对下放劳动的意义认识不足，每天劳动八小时就走，也不和工人接近。工人们觉得这个干部出身劳动人民家庭，毛主席领导劳动人民翻身得解放后，他才上了大学，当了干部。但是由于修正主义教育路线毒害了他，使他长期脱离劳动，脱离群众。于是，就通过阶级教育启发他的觉悟，使他认识到自己的错误。从此，这个干部有了很大的转变，很快就同工人打成一片，最近还被工人推选为生产技术民主管理委员会副主任。许多下放干部都象这个干部那样，在火热的阶级斗争和集体劳动中，在工人群众的亲切帮助下，不断提高了自己的政治觉悟。
    毛主席的最新指示“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动”发表后，矿革委会立即为下放干部举办了有工人群众参加的毛泽东思想学习班，组织他们学习毛主席的这一光辉指示，总结在劳动中，在同工人群众结合中的收获和体会。在学习班里，工人群众充分肯定了下放干部的成绩，同时还根据他们在下放过程中的一些活思想，对他们进行耐心细致的帮助。通过学习、总结，广大干部的认识有了进一步提高，他们说：“我们的路子走对了，一定要沿着毛主席给我们指出的光明大道走到底，和工人结合一辈子，改造一辈子思想。”（附图片）
