The revolutionary upsurge is promoting a production upsurge. The Jingxing Coal Mine has completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule. The Fengfeng Coal Mine's Lixin Mine and Hongqi Mine have completed this year's national coal production plan 74 days ahead of schedule.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang on the 23rd, the revolutionary workers of the Jingxing Coal Mine in Hebei, who completed last year's coal production task one month ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, have once again completed this year's production plan 71 days ahead of schedule on October 21st. The raw coal production has increased by 18.7% compared to the same period last year. This is a victory for the revolutionary workers of the Jingxing Coal Mine in firmly implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

After achieving the major victory of completing last year's coal production plan one month ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, the revolutionary committee members and the revolutionary workers of this coal mine, the better the situation, the more they remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle." They always put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, extensively and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle. Through revolutionary criticism and struggle, the revolutionary workers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been further heightened, and their enthusiasm for grasping revolution and promoting production has been further ignited. They reformed the old institutions and unreasonable regulations that hindered the development of productive forces, transferred office personnel to the production frontline, and greatly promoted the development of revolution and production.

Chairman Mao teaches: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Under the guidance of this great directive from Chairman Mao, the revolutionary workers actively launched more fierce attacks on the class enemies, smashed their evil plots to sabotage the revolution and production, and powerfully promoted the in-depth development of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The members of the revolutionary committee also went deep into some "old, difficult" units where the movement progressed slowly, fully mobilized the masses, thoroughly exposed the cover of class struggle, quickly changed the face of some backward units, and further promoted the rapid development of revolution and production in the entire mine area.

The revolutionary workers followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "breaking first, then establishing," fiercely criticized the reactionary revisionist technological line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the mine area, firmly grasped the leadership of production technology in the hands of the working class, carried out mass technological innovation and technological revolution activities, and realized 164 technological innovation projects in just three months, including 28 major ones, greatly improving production efficiency.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great order that the working class must lead everything, the broad working class of the Jingxing Coal Mine, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives, quickly selected more than 1,000 outstanding representatives to form a working-class Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to enter schools and other superstructure fields, and the revolutionary workers who remained in the mine bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. They insisted on leading production with revolution, and under the condition of reduced personnel, production still rose significantly.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang on the 23rd, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, and in the great upsurge of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the Lixin Mine and Hongqi Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau have completed this year's national coal production plan 74 days ahead of schedule and have triumphantly entered 1969.

The upsurge of struggle, criticism, and transformation is promoting the leap in production. The revolutionary workers of these two mines remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," persist in carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, and thoroughly criticize the reactionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev. They combined revolutionary criticism and struggle with the work of cleaning up the class ranks, unearthed a handful of class enemies hidden in the mine, and ensured the implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." The revolutionary workers of these two mines also took the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, vigorously reformed unreasonable regulations, transferred office personnel to the production frontline, and thus greatly promoted the development of production.

The support-left personnel of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region helped the revolutionary committee to regard revolutionary criticism and struggle as a powerful driving force for doing a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation, raised the awareness of line struggle among the revolutionary workers, broke the old frameworks, reformed more than 20 unreasonable regulations, and significantly increased coal production, exceeding the third-quarter production plan. This is the support-left personnel and workers together fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of managing enterprises.

    革命的高潮推动着生产的高潮
    井陉煤矿提前完成全年生产计划
    峰峰煤矿立新矿、红旗矿提前七十四天完成今年国家煤炭生产计划
    据新华社石家庄二十三日电　去年提前一个月超额完成全年煤炭生产任务的河北井陉煤矿广大革命职工，今年又提前七十一天在十月二十一日提前完成全年的生产计划，原煤产量比去年同期提高百分之十八点七。这是井陉煤矿革命职工坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”这一伟大方针的胜利。
    这个煤矿在去年取得提前一个月超额完成全年煤炭生产计划的重大胜利以后，革命委员会成员和广大革命职工越是在大好形势下越是牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠抓阶级斗争。他们始终把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，广泛深入地开展了革命大批判。通过革命大批判，广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高，更加激发了抓革命、促生产的积极性。他们改革了阻碍生产力发展的修正主义旧机构和不合理的规章制度，下放科室人员充实到生产第一线，大大促进了革命和生产的发展。
    毛主席教导说：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在毛主席这一伟大指示的指引下，广大革命职工主动地向阶级敌人发动更加猛烈的进攻，粉碎了他们破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。革委会成员还深入到一些运动进展比较迟缓的“老大难”单位，充分发动群众，大揭阶级斗争盖子，很快改变了一些后进单位的面貌，进一步推动了全矿区革命和生产的迅猛发展。
    广大革命职工遵循伟大领袖毛主席的“破字当头，立在其中”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在矿区代理人推行的反革命修正主义科技路线，把生产技术的领导大权牢牢掌握在工人阶级手中，开展了群众性的技术革新和技术革命活动，在短短的三个月内，全矿务局就实现了一百六十四项技术革新项目，其中重大的有二十八项，大大提高了生产效率。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出关于工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大号令以后，井陉煤矿广大工人群众以“只争朝夕”的革命精神落实毛主席的最新指示，迅速选派出一千多名优秀代表组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校和上层建筑其他领域，留矿革命职工勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担。他们坚持以革命统帅生产，在人员减少的情况下，生产仍然大幅度上升。
    新华社石家庄二十三日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，峰峰矿务局立新矿、红旗矿提前七十四天全面地完成了今年国家煤炭生产计划，胜利地跨入了一九六九年。
    斗、批、改高潮，推动着生产的跃进。这两个矿的革命职工牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，坚持开展革命大批判，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线。他们把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作紧密结合起来，挖出了隐藏在本矿的一小撮阶级敌人，保证了毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”这一伟大方针的贯彻执行。这两个矿的广大革命职工还以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大力改革不合理的规章制度，下放科室人员到生产第一线，从而大大推动了生产的发展。（附图片）
    沈阳部队某部驻辽源矿务局支左人员，帮助革委会把革命大批判当作搞好斗、批、改的强大动力，提高了广大革命职工的路线斗争觉悟，大破了旧框框，改革了二十多项不合理的规章制度，使煤炭生产大幅度上升，超额完成了第三季度生产计划。这是支左人员和职工一起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线。新华社稿
