Shanghai Third Machine Tool Factory's revolutionary workers have recently produced an M9017 optical tool grinding machine that reaches world advanced levels. It was designed by China independently.

This machine was produced by Shanghai Third Machine Tool Factory's revolutionary workers during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They drove out the capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary "authorities" in technology from the factory and thoroughly criticized the "crawl philosophy" advocated by China's Khrushchev. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and completed the trial production in just half a year.

    上海制成光学工具曲线磨床
    上海第三机床厂革命职工，最近制成了一台具有世界先进水平的M九○一七光学工具曲线磨床。它是我国自行设计的。
    这台机器，是上海第三机床厂革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中把厂里的走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”赶下了台，并且狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“爬行哲学”之后制造出来的。他们遵照毛主席的教导，发扬敢想、敢干的革命精神，只用了半年时间就完成了试制任务。
