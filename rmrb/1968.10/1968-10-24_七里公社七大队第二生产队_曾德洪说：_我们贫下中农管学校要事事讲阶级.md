    The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Second Production Brigade, Seventh Brigade, Qili Commune, Zeng Dehong said:
    We must speak of class in everything when managing schools

    Chairman Mao has entrusted us poor and lower-middle peasants with the management of schools. This is the greatest concern and trust he has shown us. In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev implemented a revisionist educational system that constantly discriminated against us poor and lower-middle peasants. Our brigade has over seventy households of poor and lower-middle peasants, and eleven households of landlords and rich peasants. One year, during the senior high school entrance exam, eight children of landlords and rich peasants were admitted, while only one child of a poor and lower-middle peasant was admitted. We also had two children of poor and lower-middle peasants who were expelled from school before completing junior high school because their exam scores were not up to standard.

    Some teachers stand on the side of the landlords and rich peasants, saying that our children's brains are "stupid," and that "without the roots, the sprouts won't grow." The children of landlords and rich peasants have "roots" because their parents are educated and can help them at home. These landlords and rich peasants are all hoping their children will become dragons, seeking official positions and wealth. They let their children study day and night without laboring, allowing feudal and capitalist thoughts to take root in their children's minds. We poor and lower-middle peasants have been illiterate for generations. Our children have no one to help them at home; they either hold sickles or herd ducks and cows. Household chores are heavy, and there is little time for reading. But we often educate them to listen to Chairman Mao's words, to love the collective, to love labor, and to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants in the future. We want Mao Zedong Thought to take root and flourish in our children's minds. However, the teachers in our school here did not see this as a class struggle. They only looked at students' scores, not their thoughts; they only talked about achievements, not class. The school never taught a class on class education. Some teachers came from exploiting classes and did not cut ties with their families. What could you expect them to teach?

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle is your main course." When we poor and lower-middle peasants manage schools, we must first speak of class and class struggle. Comrade Lin Biao says, Mao Zedong Thought is the thought of class struggle. When we speak of class and class struggle, we are speaking of Mao Zedong Thought. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to lead the management of schools and speak of class in everything. Who becomes a teacher, which students are admitted, what is taught, and what activities are organized—all must be led by Mao Zedong Thought and speak of class. Only by doing this can the power of the school truly be in the hands of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Only then can the students we cultivate truly be loyal to Chairman Mao and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants and the proletariat.

    七里公社七大队第二生产队  曾德洪说：
    我们贫下中农管学校要事事讲阶级
    毛主席要我们贫下中农管理学校，这是对我们贫下中农的最大关怀，最大信任。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫搞的修正主义教育制度，处处刁难我们贫下中农。我们大队有七十多户贫下中农，十一户地富，有一年高中招考，录取了八个地富子女，贫下中农子女只录取一个。我们还有两个贫下中农的子女，被学校用考试分数不及格的罪名，没有读完初中就撵出了校门。
    有个别教师站在地富的立场上，说我们贫下中农子女脑壳“木”，还说什么“没得那个根根，就发不了那个芽芽”。地富子女倒是有“根根”，他们的父母读过书，回家有人帮助。这些地富一心“望子成龙”，升官发财，让娃儿整天不劳动，读死书，让他们的封建主义、资本主义思想在娃儿脑壳里扎根根，发芽芽。我们贫下中农祖祖辈辈没有文化，娃儿回家没人帮助，不是拿镰刀把子，就是放鸭子、放牛，家务劳动重，看书时间少。但我们经常教育他们要听毛主席的话，热爱集体，热爱劳动，将来为贫下中农服务，让毛泽东思想在我们娃儿脑壳里扎根发芽，开花结果。可是过去我们这里学校的教师，看不到这是两个阶级的斗争。他们对学生，光看分数，不看思想，光讲成绩，不讲阶级。学校里从来不上阶级教育课，有的教师出身于剥削阶级家庭，又没有同家庭划清界限，你叫他讲啥子？
    毛主席教导说：“阶级斗争是你们的一门主课。”我们贫下中农管理学校，首先就要讲阶级和阶级斗争。林副主席说，毛泽东思想就是阶级斗争的思想。我们讲阶级和阶级斗争，就是要讲毛泽东思想。我们要用毛泽东思想挂帅管学校，要事事讲阶级。什么人当老师，收留什么学生，学习什么内容，开展什么活动，都要用毛泽东思想挂帅，都要讲阶级。这样做，学校的大权才能真正掌握在我们贫下中农手里，培养出来的学生才能真正忠于毛主席，为贫下中农服务，为无产阶级服务。
