The working class can lead everything—Hailing the color film "Piano Accompaniment to 'The Red Lantern'"

The workers of the Capital Workers' Long March Cultural Troupe Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and all the warriors of Guanghua Timber Factory

A new genre of proletarian revolutionary art—piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern"—has been brought to the screen, and we workers are truly delighted. We cannot help but raise our arms and shout: Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on art!

With the vigorous and stirring piano music, the screen presents a very inspiring and magnificent scene: On the stage of socialist China's arts, standing tall and proud are the heroic figures of our working class; the piano plays the lofty aspirations of our working class, "ambitions soaring to the sky"; the performers sing the thorough revolutionary spirit of our working class, "fighting to the end against the wolves." In front of the piano, our working class has, for the first time, truly become the master. Such a great film, how can it not make us workers feel more spirited and more enthusiastic!

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class has the greatest foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious." In the color film "Piano Accompaniment to 'The Red Lantern'," Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei are outstanding representatives of the great working class that has the greatest foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution.

In the important aria "Ambitions Soaring to the Sky" that portrays the heroic image of Li Yuhe, the piano prelude, with its strong and powerful music, accompanies the soaring melody, and immediately before us appears the image of a working-class hero, "shackled in iron chains," walking firmly with a heart full of anger, head held high and chest out, towards the execution ground. When it comes to "looking far ahead," the piano has a brilliant interlude, the music is bright and joyful yet majestic, making us feel that Li Yuhe, who is "brave and fearless," seems not to be in prison but on the front lines of the "sparks of anti-Japanese war that have spread everywhere," bravely fighting the enemy; seems not to be walking to the execution ground but rushing towards the socialist new China after the storm, with flowers blooming, sunshine everywhere, and red flags flying. On the execution ground, he does not think of his own "bones broken and flesh torn" personal pain, nor does he consider his own life and death; he is concerned about the party's cause, "the secret code has not reached the North Mountain," and yearns for the realization of communism throughout the world! Li Yuhe is truly great, only our working class can have such a hero. After watching the film, Li Yuhe's lofty revolutionary ideals, his broad-mindedness, and his heroic spirit of "defeating all enemies and never being subdued by the enemy" have greatly inspired us. We cannot help but proudly shout: The working class must lead everything! The working class can lead everything!

The piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" also deeply portrays the working class as a class that is most thorough in revolution. The film records the growth of the outstanding revolutionary successor of the working class, Li Tie Mei, in five arias. In "Hatred Growing in My Heart," when it comes to "mentioning the enemy, my heart explodes," the piano, with its surging and roaring sounds, fully expresses Li Tie Mei's indignation towards the class enemy, expressing Li Tie Mei's determination to take revolutionary forerunners as examples, forever holding high the red lantern, "not afraid of being caught, not afraid of being released, not afraid of being whipped, not afraid of being imprisoned! Even if my body is crushed, I will not betray the secret code." The thorough revolutionary spirit of Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei, "fighting to the end against the wolves," forever inspires us to press forward bravely.

Now, under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, the working class has taken the stage of the political struggle of criticism, denunciation, and reform in all fields of the superstructure. This is a great event of the 1960s, a great innovation in the history of the proletarian revolution. We firmly believe that the Chinese working class armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong can indeed lead everything. With the leadership of the working class that is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will surely complete the great historical task of criticism, denunciation, and reform, and surely seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    工人阶级能够领导一切
    ——欢呼彩色纪录片《钢琴伴唱〈红灯记〉》
    首都工人驻长征文工团毛泽东思想宣传队  光华木材厂全体战士
    无产阶级革命文艺的新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》搬上了银幕，我们工人真是打心眼里喜欢。我们禁不住振臂高呼：无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁！
    随着刚健激越的琴声，银幕上出现一幅十分振奋人心的壮丽图景：在社会主义新中国的文艺舞台上，巍然屹立的是咱们工人阶级顶天立地的英雄形象；钢琴弹奏的是我们工人阶级“雄心壮志冲云天”的豪情壮志，演员歌唱的是咱们工人阶级“打不尽豺狼决不下战场”的彻底革命精神。在钢琴面前，咱们工人阶级开天辟地第一回成了真正的主人。这样的好影片，怎不叫我们工人越看越长志气，越听干劲越足！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”彩色纪录片《钢琴伴唱〈红灯记〉》中的李玉和、李铁梅，就是这种最有远见、大公无私、最富于革命的彻底性的伟大工人阶级的杰出代表。
    在塑造李玉和英雄形象的重要唱段“雄心壮志冲云天”中，钢琴的前奏，那强健雄壮的琴声，伴和着高昂的曲调，我们的面前立刻出现一个“戴铁镣裹铁链”，迈着坚定的步伐，怀着满腔的怒火，昂首挺胸走向刑场的工人阶级的英雄形象。当唱到“抬头远看”的时候，钢琴有一段精采的间奏，音乐明亮欢快而气势磅礴，使我们感到“浑身是胆雄赳赳”的李玉和，仿佛不是身在牢房，而是在那“抗日的烽火已燎原”的抗日前线英勇杀敌；仿佛不是走向刑场，而是奔向那风雨过后百花吐艳、阳光普照、红旗插遍的社会主义新中国。在刑场上，他想的不是“筋骨断，体肤裂”的个人痛苦，考虑的不是个人生命的安危；他关心的是“密电码，未到北山”的党的事业，向往的是共产主义理想在全世界实现！李玉和真是好样的，只有我们工人阶级，才有这样的英雄。看了影片，李玉和那高瞻远瞩的伟大革命理想，那大公无私的博大胸襟，那“要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的英雄气概，使我们受到极大的鼓舞，我们禁不住自豪地高呼：工人阶级必须领导一切！工人阶级能够领导一切！
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》还深刻地表现了工人阶级是一个最富于革命的彻底性的阶级。影片纪录了工人阶级优秀的革命事业接班人李铁梅成长的五个唱段。在“仇恨入心要发芽”中，当唱到“提起敌寇心肺炸”时，钢琴以汹涌澎湃的音响，充分地表现了李铁梅仇恨阶级敌人的激愤感情，表现了李铁梅决心以革命先辈为榜样，永远高举红灯，“不怕抓，不怕放，不怕皮鞭打，不怕监牢押！粉身碎骨不交密电码”的彻底革命精神。李玉和、李铁梅这种“打不尽豺狼决不下战场”的工人阶级的革命彻底性，永远激励着我们奋勇前进。
    现在，我们工人阶级遵照伟大领袖毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大指示，登上了上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台。这是二十世纪六十年代的伟大事件，是无产阶级革命史上的伟大创举。我们深信，用伟大毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级完全能够领导一切。有了无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的工人阶级的领导，就一定能够胜利完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务，就一定能够夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
