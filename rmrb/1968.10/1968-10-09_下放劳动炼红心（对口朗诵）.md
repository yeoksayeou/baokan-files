    Laboring in the Countryside to Temper the Heart
    (Duet Recitation)
    Chong Hua

    The east wind blows, carrying good news,
    Thunder roars across the vast sky;
    Chairman Mao's latest instructions have been issued,
    Mountains and rivers rejoice and sing.

    Broad masses of cadres going to the countryside to labor is a great opportunity for them to re-learn. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also go to the countryside in batches.

    Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like sunshine,
    Illuminating the hearts of millions;
    Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like rain,
    Nourishing the growing crops.

    The great leader points the way forward,
    The path ahead is broad and vast!
    Cadres going to the countryside to labor,
    Is a great opportunity to re-learn,
    Cadres going to the countryside to labor,
    Is a guarantee to consolidate the red regime;
    Cadres going to the countryside to labor,
    Is a long-term plan to carry the revolution through to the end,
    Cadres going to the countryside to labor,
    Is to build an iron wall to resist and prevent revisionism.

    We cheer,
    We cheer the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions,
    We sing,
    We sing of Chairman Mao pointing the way forward for revolutionary cadres.

    The great commander gives the order,
    Revolutionary cadres' spirits soar,
    Resolutely carrying out the instructions,
    Without any hesitation.

    With boundless enthusiasm, we go to factories and mines,
    With our bags packed, we go to the countryside,
    We throw ourselves into the waves of class struggle,
    We rush to the battlefield of production struggle;
    We earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform,
    We fiercely fight the battle against selfishness and revisionism;
    We put down our airs,
    We reform our thoughts.

    We take the revolutionary masses as our teachers,
    We willingly become their students.

    We temper our hearts to be even redder,
    We temper our wills to be even stronger.

    We roll in mud and dirt,
    We temper our shoulders to be like iron;
    With shoulders carrying the manure basket,
    We undertake the heavy task of carrying the revolution through to the end,
    With giant hands wielding the hoe,
    We paint a picture of spring everywhere in the vast land.

    Revolutionary cadres have great aspirations,
    They welcome the wind and frost in the countryside.

    With silver hoes,
    They go to paint a picture of the happy red land;
    They change the world,
    They compose a new chapter of communism.

    They temper a heart that is fiery red,
    They offer it to the sun in their hearts, the reddest of the red.

    下放劳动炼红心
    （对口朗诵）
    崇华
    东风浩荡传喜讯，
    万里长空春雷响；
    毛主席最新指示发表了，
    千山欢呼万水唱。
    广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。
    毛主席最新指示是阳光，
    阳光照亮万人心；
    毛主席最新指示是雨露，
    雨露滋润禾苗壮。
    伟大领袖指航向，
    前进征途多宽广！
    干部下放劳动，
    是重新学习的极好机会，
    干部下放劳动，
    是巩固红色政权的保障；
    干部下放劳动，
    是将革命进行到底的万年大计，
    干部下放劳动，
    是筑起反修防修的铁壁铜墙。
    我们欢呼啊，
    欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表，
    我们歌唱啊，
    歌唱毛主席为革命干部指出了前进的方向。
    伟大统帅一声令，
    革命干部斗志昂，
    坚决照办，
    决不徬徨。
    满怀豪情去厂矿，
    背起行装上山下乡，
    投入阶级斗争的风浪，
    奔向生产斗争的战场；
    认真搞好斗、批、改，
    猛打斗私批修思想仗；
    放下架子，
    改造思想。
    拜革命群众为老师，
    甘心情愿把学生当。
    把心炼得更红，
    意志炼得更强。
    滚一身土泥巴，
    炼一副铁肩膀；
    用挑着粪筐的铁肩，
    挑起革命到底的重任，
    用挥动锄头的巨手，
    绘出万里山河处处春光。
    革命干部多奇志，
    下放劳动迎风霜。
    挥银锄，
    去描绘红色江山幸福图；
    改天地，
    去谱写共产主义新篇章。
    炼出一颗火红的忠心，
    献给心中最红最红的红太阳。
