During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shanghai had a large number of ordinary workers who underwent the test and tempering of class struggle, and were elected to leadership positions in various levels of revolutionary committees. Although their status changed, their proletarian character did not. The broad masses of workers praised, "Our worker committee members are great!" "With such comrades in power, we are at ease!"

Chen Deyi, a repairman in the weaving workshop of Shanghai No. 32 Cotton Mill, was elected as a member of the mill's revolutionary committee. After becoming a committee member, he insisted on not leaving production and is a good committee member praised by the revolutionary masses of the entire mill.

Chen Deyi is an old worker and a Communist Party member from a poor peasant family. In the old society, he suffered cruel oppression and exploitation from landlords and capitalists. After liberation, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and the Party, he actively participated in various political movements, worked hard in production, and set an example in everything. He enjoyed high prestige among the masses. In January of this year, the mill established a revolutionary committee, and Chen Deyi was elected as a member.

On the day the mill's revolutionary committee was established, all the comrades in the weaving workshop's Class C, Group 2 were both happy and worried: they were happy that Chen Deyi was elected as a member of the mill's revolutionary committee, which was an honor for the entire small group and workshop. With such a trusted worker representative as a committee member, he would surely do a good job in his leadership responsibilities; they were worried that such a good repairman had left the small group, fearing that production would suffer. However, they did not expect that Chen Deyi had already made up his mind: if he were elected as a member of the mill's revolutionary committee, he would definitely follow Chairman Mao's teaching of being "both an official and a common citizen" and would not leave production!

After becoming a member of the mill's revolutionary committee, Chen Deyi indeed never left labor. When it was the night shift, no matter how late he worked during the day, he always insisted on coming to work at night; when it was the day shift, no matter how late the revolutionary committee meeting was the previous night, he never arrived late by half a minute. This made the comrades in the small group both happy and worried: they were happy that Old Chen was still with them; they were worried about Old Chen's health. However, Chen Deyi took Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Mountain as examples, and often said, "Days pass one by one, and once a day is gone, it can never come back. I want to use every day to do more things that benefit the people."

During the process of participating in labor, Chen Deyi always used his actual actions to help his comrades move forward together.

One day, he saw that the loom operator Wu Aifeng was not feeling well and had difficulty managing forty-eight looms. He took the initiative to help her clear the stopped looms, giving Wu Aifeng more confidence to manage the forty-eight looms well.

Once, to meet the production needs, the loom speed was increased from 350 revolutions per minute to 385 revolutions per minute. The loom operators were not yet familiar with the new speed, causing some looms to malfunction. At this time, Chen Deyi patiently repaired each malfunctioning loom one by one. One day, just before the end of the shift, he found that one loom in the row had not been repaired and was about to be handed over to the next shift. He quietly helped the repairman in the row to repair it, providing convenience for the next shift.

Another time, he saw that the section where Yang Bulou worked had the highest rate of malfunctioning looms and was having difficulty managing them. He took the initiative to switch sections with Yang Bulou and took on the heavier revolutionary tasks.

Where there was difficulty, Chen Deyi appeared. No matter how difficult the work was, he never said it was difficult; no matter how tiring the work was, he never said it was tiring. Perhaps someone thought he was a "good-natured person"? No! He was not a good-natured person without principles. There was a counter-revolutionary who had infiltrated the worker ranks and often spread reactionary remarks under the guise of telling jokes. Chen Deyi reminded everyone, "There is class struggle even in telling jokes. We must heighten our political alertness!" Under his leadership, after exposure and struggle, the counter-revolutionary was finally exposed.

Chen Deyi is such a good worker, good party member, and good committee member who is praised by the revolutionary masses for being lenient to himself and harsh to the enemy.

    既当“官”，又当老百姓
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，上海市有大批普通工人经受了阶级斗争风暴的考验和锤炼，被推选到各级革命委员会的领导岗位。他们虽然地位变了，但是工人阶级本色没有变。广大工人群众赞扬说：“我们的工人委员就是好！”“有这样的同志掌权，我们放心了！”
    上海国棉三十二厂织布车间丙班二排修机工陈德义当了厂革委会委员以后，坚持不脱离生产，是一个受全厂革命群众赞扬的好委员。
    陈德义是贫农出身的老工人、共产党员。他在旧社会饱受地主、资本家的残酷压迫和剥削，解放后怀着对毛主席对党的无比热爱，积极投入各项政治运动，生产上埋头苦干，处处以身作则，在群众中享有较高的威信。今年一月，厂里成立革命委员会，陈德义被选为厂革委会委员。
    在庆祝厂革委会成立那一天，织布车间丙班二排的全体同志既高兴又担心：高兴的是陈德义当选为厂革委会委员，这是全小组、全车间的光荣，这样一位大家信得过的工人代表当上了委员之后，一定能把他所担负的领导工作做好；担心的是，小组里走了这么好的一位修机工，怕以后生产搞不好。可是，他们没有想到陈德义心里早已有了打算：如果自己被选为厂革委会委员，一定要按照毛主席的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导办事，决不脱离生产！
    陈德义当上厂革委会委员以后，果然一直没有脱离劳动。逢到夜班，不管白天工作到什么时候，晚上总是坚持来上班；逢到早班，不管头天晚上厂革委会会议开得多迟，第二天从不迟到半分钟。这一来，却使得小组的同志又是既高兴又担心：高兴的是，老陈一直和大家在一起；担心的是老陈的身体受影响。可是，陈德义却以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，他经常说：“日子一天天过去，过去一天永远也不能再回来。我要利用这每一天的时间，多做一些对人民有利的事情。”
    在参加劳动的过程中，陈德义总是用自己的实际行动帮助同志们共同前进。
    有一天，他看见挡车工吴爱凤身体不大舒服，挡四十八台车有困难，他就主动地帮助她抢开停台，使吴爱凤增加了信心，挡好了四十八台布机。
    有一次，为了增产需要，布机车速由每分钟三百五十转增加到三百八十五转，挡车工一时没摸熟规律，造成坏车。这时候，陈德义便耐心地一次又一次地修复每一台坏车。有一天快下班了，他发现一排有台坏车没修好就准备交给下一班，他便一声不响地帮助一排修机工修复好，为下一班提供了方便。
    又有一次，他见到杨步楼所在的工区坏车率最高，掌握有困难，就主动和杨步楼同志换一个工区工作，抢挑革命的重担。
    那里有困难，陈德义就出现在那里。工作再难，他不叫一声难；工作再累，他不叫一声累。也许有人认为他是个“老好人”吧？不！他可不是毫无原则的“老好人”。有一个混进工人队伍的反革命分子，平时专以讲笑话为名，散布各种反动的言论。陈德义就提醒大家说：“讲笑话中也有阶级斗争。我们一定要提高政治嗅觉！”在他带领下，经过揭发斗争，最后终于把这个反革命分子揪了出来。
    陈德义就是这样一个受革命群众赞扬的对己和、对敌狠的好工人、好党员、好委员。
