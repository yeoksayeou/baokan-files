Title: Criticize the "Join the Party to Become an Official" Theory

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office but are seeking revolution." To seek revolution or to seek office—that is the fundamental difference between true and false Communists.

The traitorous scoundrel, Chinese Khrushchev, brazenly opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian line on party building and openly advocates the decadent philosophy of "joining the party to become an official." He blathers on about how "in the past, passing the imperial examination meant becoming an official, and now, joining the Communist Party also means becoming an official. The party member is a reserve list for cadres." This is the self-portrait of Chinese Khrushchev, the opportunist politician, and a blatant exposure of his ugly soul.

Chinese Khrushchev and his agents regard infiltrating the Communist Party as their stepping stone to promotion and wealth. For the sake of becoming officials, they can falsify history, deceive, and use the honorable title of Communist Party member as a ladder to climb up; for the sake of becoming officials, they can form cliques, engage in factionalism, and turn the party's cause into a battleground for their personal gain; for the sake of becoming officials, they can crawl out from the enemy's holes, sell their souls, betray comrades, and betray the party.

For Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, as long as they can become officials, they don't care whether it's the Wang Jingwei faction, the Chiang Kai-shek faction, or the revisionist party, or the imperialist party—they can all join and be happy to associate with them. Is this an exaggeration? No, there are concrete facts. Long before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chinese Khrushchev, in order to save his skin and climb up, had shamefully knelt down before the imperialists and the reactionary Kuomintang, betraying the revolution and the party; after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he wanted to make himself up and go to the door of the reactionary Kuomintang government, eager to hand over military power, party power, and liberated areas, and betray the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, willing to be the running dog of the tyrant Chiang Kai-shek.

Chinese Khrushchev's concoction of the "join the party to become an official" theory is extremely malicious in intent and extremely despicable in method.

He attempts to use the "join the party to become an official" theory to corrupt the souls of our Communist Party members, making them only know how to seek fame and wealth and climb up, forgetting the people, forgetting the party, and forgetting the great direction of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

He attempts to use the "join the party to become an official" theory to poison our party's broad cadre, inducing them to become detached from reality, detached from labor, detached from the masses, high above, acting like officials and lords, comfortably and gradually transforming into revisionists.

He attempts to use the "join the party to become an official" theory to surrender and recruit, form cliques, and gather spies, traitors, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders, using every means to help these bad guys seize the party's leading positions, and in the proletarian dictatorship apparatus, to form a counter-revolutionary bourgeois command.

In a word, Chinese Khrushchev is attempting to use the most decadent and darkest "join the party to become an official" theory to erode the revolutionary will of our party members, corrode the healthy body of our party, and thus gradually transform our party into a bourgeois party, a fascist party, creating conditions for his restoration of capitalism.

The ant climbing the locust tree boasts of its great country, the cicada shaking the tree talks of ease. Chinese Khrushchev, this great schemer, attempts to use the "join the party to become an official" theory to make our great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China degenerate and change quality—that can only be a daytime dream, which will never succeed!

Our party's broad cadres and members remember Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the people's heads." They have long criticized and firmly opposed the reactionary "join the party to become an official" theory!

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, our party's tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters have high revolutionary ideals and noble revolutionary styles. They seek neither fame nor wealth, but dedicate themselves to the revolution, doing everything for the revolution, being "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people. For the revolution, they are willing to be the people's old yellow ox; for the revolution, they fear neither fire nor water; for the revolution, they are willing to shed their blood to write an epic.

The boundlessly magnificent cause of communism needs such heroes and nurtures such heroes. They join the party not to become officials but to make the revolution. Even if they become "officials," they are "both officials and common people." The outstanding representative of the Dazhai people, Comrade Chen Yonggui, although he has become an "official," is still an ordinary laborer. He still wraps his head with that white towel, wears that old cloth jacket, his calluses are still thick, his clothes are still dirty, and his face is still black—what a pure and great image of a Communist Party cadre!

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "A large number of cadres going down to labor is a good opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." Chairman Mao's brilliant directive is a long-term strategy to prevent and guard against revisionism, a great strategic measure to cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. We must rise up with the mighty club of Mao Zedong Thought, criticize and denounce the reactionary "join the party to become an official" theory, so that our party members will always maintain revolutionary youth, and our party will always remain red.

    批臭“入党做官论”
    北京部队空军  赤兵
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。要革命，还是要做官，这是真假共产党员的根本区别。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个无耻的大叛徒，猖狂地反对毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，公然鼓吹“入党做官论”的腐朽哲学，胡说什么：“过去考上秀才就可以做官，现在加入了共产党，也可以做官，这个党员就是干部的后备名单。”这是中国赫鲁晓夫投机政客的自画像，是他丑恶灵魂的大暴露。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，就是把混入共产党当作他们升官发财的敲门砖。为做官，他们可以伪造历史，招摇撞骗，把共产党员的光荣称号当作向上爬的阶梯；为做官，他们可以拉山头，搞宗派，把党的事业当作他们争名夺利的角逐场；为做官，他们可以从敌人的狗洞里爬出来，出卖灵魂，出卖同志，出卖党。
    对于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人说来，只要能做官，哪管什么汪记党、蒋记党，还是修正主义的党、帝国主义的党，他们都可以加入，都可以甘与为伍。这是否言过其实？不，这是有确确凿凿事实的。早在抗日战争以前，中国赫鲁晓夫为了保全狗命向上爬，就曾可耻地跪倒在帝国主义和国民党反动派的脚下，叛变革命、叛变党；在抗日战争胜利以后，他为了做国民党反动政府的官，又想梳妆打扮，送上门去，迫不及待地要交出军权，交出党权，交出解放区，断送中国人民的革命事业，甘当独夫民贼蒋介石的叭儿狗。
    中国赫鲁晓夫炮制“入党做官论”，用心十分险恶，手法也是极端卑鄙的。
    他妄图利用“入党做官论”，腐蚀我们共产党员的灵魂，使他们只知追名逐利向上爬，忘记人民，忘记党，忘记无产阶级专政下继续革命的大方向。
    他妄图利用“入党做官论”，毒害我们党的广大干部，诱使他们脱离实际，脱离劳动，脱离群众，高高在上，当官做老爷，舒舒服服地逐步和平演变为修正主义分子。
    他妄图利用“入党做官论”，招降纳叛，结党营私，网罗特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派，千方百计地帮助这帮坏蛋攫取党的领导职位，在无产阶级专政机构内部拼凑反革命的资产阶级司令部。
    一句话，中国赫鲁晓夫就是妄图利用最腐朽最黑暗的“入党做官论”，磨灭我们党员的革命意志，侵蚀我们党的健全肌体，从而使我们的党逐步蜕变为资产阶级的党、法西斯党，为他复辟资本主义创造条件。
    蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。中国赫鲁晓夫这个大野心家，妄图用“入党做官论”使我们伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党蜕化变质，那只能是白日作梦，是永远也不会得逞的！
    我们党的广大干部和党员，牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”对于反动的“入党做官论”，他们是早有批判的，是坚决反对的！
    在毛泽东思想哺育下，我们党的成千成万的优秀儿女，具有崇高的革命理想和高尚的革命风格。他们一不为名，二不为利，一心为革命，一切为革命，“完全”、“彻底”为人民。为革命，他们甘当人民的老黄牛；为革命，他们赴汤蹈火心不跳；为革命，他们愿洒热血谱史诗。
    无限壮丽的共产主义事业，就需要这样的英雄，就哺育这样的英雄。他们加入党，不是要做官，而是要革命。他们即使当了“官”，也是“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”。大寨人的杰出代表陈永贵同志，虽然当了“官”，但仍然是一个普通劳动者。他头上裹的还是那块白毛巾，身上穿的还是那件旧布衫，手上的老茧还是那么厚，衣服上的泥巴还是那么多，脸膛还是那么黑——这是多么纯朴、高大的共产党员干部的光辉形象啊！
    毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”毛主席的这一光辉指示，是反修防修的千年大计，是培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人的伟大战略措施。我们一定奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，批倒批臭反动的“入党做官论”，使我们的党员永葆革命青春，使我们的党永远保持鲜红的颜色。
