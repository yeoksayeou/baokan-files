The Malaysian newspaper *Frontline* recently published an article titled "Ironclad Evidence of the Soviet Revisionists' Betrayal of the Malaysian People's Interests," exposing and condemning the Soviet revisionist clique's collusion with American and British imperialism and their lackeys, the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew puppet regimes, in their conspiracy to sabotage and suppress the Malaysian people's national liberation struggle.

The article points out that as early as 1962, the Soviet revisionist clique colluded with American and British imperialism to concoct the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia." The article states: "Last November, the Soviet revisionist clique established 'diplomatic relations' with the neo-colonialist product 'Malaysia.' This March, the Soviet revisionist clique's first ambassador arrived in Kuala Lumpur. In June, the Soviet revisionist clique also established 'diplomatic relations' with the new colony 'Republic of Singapore' and exchanged ambassador-level diplomatic personnel. This is the Soviet revisionist clique's barefaced betrayal of the Malaysian people's anti-imperialist struggle."

The article further points out: "Recently, the Soviet revisionist clique has been in frequent contact with the lackeys of American and British imperialism—the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew puppet regimes—and their relations have become very close. The Soviet revisionist clique even invited the puppet Razak to visit the Soviet Union and provided 'military aid' to the puppet regime to suppress the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of North Kalimantan and Malaysia. This shows how much the Soviet revisionist clique fears and hates the revolutionary people of North Kalimantan and Malaysia! On the other hand, they cater to the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew regimes in every way, striving to support and bolster the anti-communist, anti-Chinese, anti-people, and anti-socialist policies of the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew puppet regimes."

The article states: "The Soviet revisionist clique not only betrays the Malaysian people's interests politically but also carries out extensive economic and cultural aggression against Malaysia. Economic and cultural delegations from the Soviet revisionist clique have been arriving in Malaysia one after another. The Soviet revisionist clique even recently said with great enthusiasm that they would provide comprehensive 'economic aid' to the Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew puppet regimes, offering 'experts,' 'technology,' or 'equipment' as needed. This is extremely shameful and reactionary; they are colluding with the puppet regime in dirty deals. All of this is ironclad evidence of the Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of the Malaysian people."

The article exposes: "The facts are clear: the Soviet revisionist clique's so-called 'economic cooperation' and 'cultural exchange' are well-planned conspiracies. The Soviet revisionist clique aims to use the same methods as American and British imperialism's capital exports, conducting economic infiltration and aggression through so-called 'economic aid' and 'economic cooperation,' gradually influencing and controlling Malaysia's economy. Similarly, the Soviet revisionist clique also aims to use the same methods as American and British imperialism's cultural infiltration, spreading revisionist, bourgeois, decadent, reactionary culture through 'cultural exchange' and 'cultural cooperation,' gradually poisoning the Malaysian people, especially the youth, making their thoughts degenerate, and thus abandoning the anti-imperialist struggle. This is a vile imperialist and colonialist aggression!"

The article points out: "Today, the Soviet revisionist clique has degenerated into social imperialism. Their political, military, economic, and cultural infiltration and aggression against Malaysia are part of the so-called 'U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world.'"

The article concludes: "The various treacherous acts of the modern revisionist clique centered around the Soviet revisionist clique against the Malaysian national liberation cause have deeply educated the Malaysian people, raised their political awareness, and made them fully realize that U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are the Malaysian people's sworn enemies. Therefore, to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism. The oppressed and exploited nationalities and peoples of Malaysia, while opposing U.S. imperialism, must resolutely and thoroughly expose the Soviet revisionist clique's treacherous deeds and conspiracies of betraying the Malaysian people's interests and give them a crushing blow."

    苏修出卖马来亚人民利益铁证如山
    马来亚《阵线报》揭露苏修勾结美英及其走狗破坏马来亚人民斗争的无耻行径
    新华社讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》最近以《苏修出卖马来亚人民利益的铁证》为题发表文章，揭露和谴责苏修叛徒集团勾结美英帝国主义及其走狗拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团，阴谋破坏和扑灭马来亚人民民族解放斗争的无耻行径。
    文章指出，苏修叛徒集团早在一九六二年就和美英帝国主义串通，拼凑新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”。文章说：“去年十一月，苏修叛徒集团跟新殖民主义产物‘马来西亚’建立‘外交关系’。今年三月，苏修叛徒集团第一任大使到达吉隆坡。六月，苏修叛徒集团又跟新型殖民地‘新加坡共和国’建立‘外交关系’，并互派大使级外交人员。这是苏修叛徒集团赤裸裸的背叛马来亚人民反帝斗争的无耻行径。”
    文章接着指出：“最近，苏修叛徒集团跟美英帝国主义的走狗——拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团频频接触，搞得十分火热。苏修叛徒集团甚至邀请傀儡拉扎克访问苏联，并向傀儡集团提供‘军事援助’，以镇压北加里曼丹和马来亚人民的反帝斗争。由此可见苏修叛徒集团是何等害怕和仇视北加里曼丹和马来亚革命人民！另一方面，他们对拉赫曼、李光耀集团却是处处照顾，努力扶持，极力支持拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团的反共、反华、反人民、反社会主义的政策。”
    文章说：“苏修叛徒集团，不但在政治上出卖马来亚人民的利益，同时，他们还对马来亚进行广泛的经济和文化侵略。苏修叛徒集团的经济文化等代表团，一个紧接一个地飞来马来亚。”“苏修叛徒集团不久前甚至极其狂热地说，他们将向拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团提供全面的‘经济援助’，不论需要‘专家’、‘技术’或者‘器材’方面的‘援助’，可由拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权加以选择。真是可耻之极，反动之极，他们竟然同傀儡政权狼狈为奸，搞肮脏交易。所有这一切，都是苏修叛徒集团出卖马来亚人民的铁证。”
    文章揭露说：“事实昭然若揭，苏修叛徒集团的所谓‘经济合作’以及所谓‘文化交流’，是有步骤、有计划的阴谋诡计。苏修叛徒集团企图采用如同美英帝国主义资本输出的方式，通过所谓‘经济援助’、‘经济合作’，进行经济渗透和经济侵略，逐步地影响和控制马来亚的经济。同样地苏修叛徒集团也企图采取如同美英帝国主义文化渗透的方式，通过什么‘文化交流’，‘文化合作’，散播修正主义、资产阶级的腐朽、没落、反动的文化，逐渐地毒害马来亚人民，尤其是青年一代，使他们的思想堕落，从而放弃反帝斗争。这是何等恶毒的帝国主义、殖民主义的侵略行径！”
    文章指出：“今天苏修叛徒集团已沦为社会帝国主义。他们对马来亚进行政治的、军事的、经济的和文化的渗透和侵略，就是所谓‘美苏合作主宰世界’的一部分。”
    文章最后强调说：“以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义集团，对于马来亚的民族解放事业所作的种种叛卖行径，深深地教育了马来亚人民，提高了马来亚人民的政治觉悟，使他们充分地认识到：美帝苏修是马来亚人民不共戴天的敌人。因此，反帝就必须反修，马来亚被压迫被剥削的民族和人民在反对美帝的同时，要坚决、彻底地揭露苏修叛徒集团出卖马来亚人民利益的无耻勾当和阴谋诡计，并且坚决地给予毁灭性的打击。”
