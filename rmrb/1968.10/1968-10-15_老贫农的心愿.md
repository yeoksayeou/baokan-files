One day, old poor peasant Feng Bingjun from Hongwei Brigade, Shuiyuan Commune, Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, received a notice from the school's Education Revolution Committee. The notice instructed his daughter, Xiuqin, who was on holiday, to return to school immediately to serve as a tutor. Old Feng thought to himself: This is a great opportunity for us poor and lower-middle peasants to contribute to the education revolution. He happily helped his daughter prepare her luggage.

Xiuqin was about to set off when suddenly a heavy downpour began. Should she go or not? Xiuqin hesitated. Old Feng understood his daughter's thoughts and encouraged her, saying, "Chairman Mao trusts us poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the schools. This is a great honor! Chairman Mao values us. Even if it were raining daggers, we would still go!" Xiuqin, inspired by her father's encouragement, gained the courage to overcome difficulties and decided to set out immediately. Old Feng stood up, took the umbrella from Xiuqin's hand, and said with a smile, "Come, Dad will walk you to school!" With that, father and daughter set off into the rain, heading towards the school.

The rain grew heavier, and before they had gone far, they were soaked to the skin. They trudged through the muddy paths, slipping with every step. Old Feng, with deep proletarian feelings, wanted to see the education revolution through to the end. As they walked, he recounted a bitter episode from forty years ago. "When I was in my teens," he said, "one day, it was raining just as heavily. Your grandfather sent me to the landlord's house to herd cattle. I was wearing a piece of sackcloth and a straw raincoat. We cried all the way. Today, Chairman Mao has entrusted us poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the schools. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's intentions. We must manage the schools well, carry out the education revolution thoroughly, and make Chairman Mao proud!"

Old Feng's words awakened Xiuqin's class consciousness. Chairman Mao's latest directives made her deeply understand the importance of seizing the cultural power. Xiuqin could not contain her excitement and resolved to work with revolutionary teachers and students to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian education line, and carry the education revolution through to the end.

Father and daughter grew more excited as they talked, and their spirits soared. They forgot their fatigue and the wind, rain, and muddy paths. They sang "Determine to struggle, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," a song based on Chairman Mao's sayings, and arrived at the school in one breath.

    老贫农的心愿
    一天，辽宁营口县水源公社红卫大队的老贫农冯秉俊，接到学校教育革命委员会的通知，让放假在家的女儿秀琴立刻赶回学校当辅导员。冯大爷心想：这可是咱贫下中农为教育革命尽力的好机会。他乐呵呵地赶紧帮助女儿准备行装。
    秀琴刚要赶路，忽然下起了瓢泼大雨，走不走呢？秀琴有点犹豫。冯大爷猜透了秀琴的心事，便开导她说：“毛主席让咱贫下中农管理学校，这对咱们是多大的信任啊！毛主席器重咱们，别说下雨，就是下尖刀咱也要去！”秀琴听到爸爸的鼓励，增加了战胜困难的勇气，决定马上动身。冯大爷站起来夺过秀琴手中的雨伞，笑着说：“走，爸爸送你去！”说着，父女二人冒着大雨，一同向学校走去。
    雨越下越大，父女俩没走出多远，浑身上下淋得透湿。他们踏着泥泞的道路，一步一滑地走着。冯大爷为了教育女儿带着深厚的无产阶级感情，把教育革命进行到底，一边走，一边讲起了四十年前的一段辛酸往事。他说：“在我十几岁的时候，有一天，也是下着这样大的雨，你爷爷送我到地主家放牛，我身上披着一块麻袋片，头上顶着蓑衣头，我们爷俩走一路哭一路。今天，毛主席让我们贫下中农管理学校，咱千万不能辜负毛主席的一片心意，一定要把学校管好，把教育革命搞彻底，为毛主席争气呀！”
    冯大爷的话，启发了秀琴的阶级觉悟，毛主席的最新指示，更使她深刻认识到掌握文化大权的重要。秀琴抑制不住内心的激动，决心和革命师生一起，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，把教育革命进行到底。
    父女二人越唠越兴奋，越唠浑身越有劲，忘记了疲劳，忘记了风雨的袭击和泥泞的道路，一边走，一边唱起了“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的毛主席语录歌曲，一口气奔到了学校。
