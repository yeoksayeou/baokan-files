Farmers near Chillán, Chile, occupy estate owner's house

	Several dozen farmers near Chillán, Chile, occupied the house of the estate owner on October 16, demanding that the 400 hectares of land owned by the estate be distributed to the impoverished farmers who work the land.

	According to reports, the revolutionary actions of the farmers immediately received the active support and response of more than 300 other farmers in the surrounding area, who also demanded the confiscation of the land of eight other nearby estates.

	The authorities in Chillán were terrified by the broad demands of the farmers and immediately dispatched 600 troops equipped with machine guns and light tanks to suppress the movement. However, the revolutionary farmers were undeterred. They broke through the military and police cordon and went to Chillán to make contact with revolutionary students there, issuing a statement demanding the confiscation of the estate within 24 hours, otherwise they would take "new measures."

	The students of Chillán actively supported the farmers' revolutionary actions, immediately declaring a strike, occupying the school buildings, and joining the farmers in demonstrations to protest the brutal exploitation of the farmers by the estate owners. They also set up barricades on the roads leading from the city to the estate to prevent the reactionary military and police from carrying out their violent actions.

    大中学生罢课，占领学校并和农民一起示威游行支持农民的革命行动
    新华社十八日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利纽夫莱省奇利安市附近一个庄园数十名农民十六日占领这个庄园的庄园主的房屋，他们要求把这个庄园所拥有四百公顷的土地分给耕种这些土地的贫苦农民。
    据报道，这个庄园的农民的革命行动立即得到这个地区附近的另外三百多名农民的积极支持和响应，并且要求征收附近另外八个庄园的土地。
    奇利安市当局被广大农民这种正义要求吓得要死，立即出动六百名配备机关枪和轻型坦克的军队前去镇压。但是，革命的农民毫不畏惧，他们突破军警的包围圈，到奇利安市同那里的革命学生取得联系，并发表声明，要求在二十四小时内征收这座庄园，否则将采取“新的斗争行动”。
    奇利安市的大、中学生对农民的革命行动给予积极支持，立即宣布罢课，占领学校的大楼，并和农民一起举行示威游行，抗议庄园主对农民的残酷剥削。同时，还在由这个城市通往那个庄园的路上筑起了路障，阻止前往镇压的反动军警的暴行。
