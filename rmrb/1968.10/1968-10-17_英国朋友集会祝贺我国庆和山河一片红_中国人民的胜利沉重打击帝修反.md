According to a report from the New China News Agency in London, the "Friends of China" organization in Britain held a gathering on the 6th to enthusiastically celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

A British worker, speaking at the gathering, pointed out that the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China, except Taiwan, are heavy blows to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

He said, "Not only are the revolutionary people of China celebrating these victories, but from Japan to Mexico, from Britain to Australia, all true revolutionaries are celebrating these great victories of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought."

He emphasized that under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great revolutionary people of China are realizing all the hopes and expectations entrusted to them by the proletarian revolution.

Another British worker, in his speech, said, "Revolutionary people all over the world are advancing, applying the great Mao Zedong Thought to their own specific situations." He pointed out that revolutionary people all over the world are sweeping away all the garbage of the old world into the dustbin of history with a giant broom, opening up a brand new era.

In his speech, he strongly condemned the anti-China crimes of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. He said, "You traitors in the Kremlin, put your ugly heads in cold water to cool off! China has millions of friends around the world who have long decided to stand with China in the fiercest storms. We are also arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and if you dare to act recklessly, you will face devastating blows here in Britain as well."

An Indian at the meeting said, "Today, our hearts are filled with joy. We are happy because Chairman Mao has ensured through the Cultural Revolution that China will never change color. This is Chairman Mao's great contribution to the consolidation of proletarian dictatorship."

    中国人民的胜利沉重打击帝修反
    据新华社伦敦电　英国的“中国之友”组织六日举行集会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年和中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    一位英国工人在集会上发表讲话时指出，中华人民共和国成立十九周年和中国除台湾省外的各省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会，是对帝、修、反的沉重打击。
    他说：“不但中国的革命人民庆祝这些胜利，而且从日本到墨西哥，从英国到澳大利亚，一切真正的革命者都庆祝马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的这些伟大胜利。”
    他强调说，在光辉的毛泽东思想的指引下，伟大的中国革命人民正在实现革命的无产阶级赋予他们的一切希望和期望。
    另一位英国工人在讲话中说：“全世界的革命人民都在前进，都在把伟大的毛泽东思想运用于他们各自的具体情况。”他指出，全世界的革命人民正在挥动巨大的扫帚，把旧世界的一切垃圾扫进历史的垃圾堆，开辟一个崭新的时代。
    他在讲话中强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团的反华罪行。他说：“克里姆林宫的叛徒们，把你们的丑恶脑袋放到冷水里凉一凉吧！中国在全世界有千百万朋友，他们早就下定决心要在最激烈的暴风雨里同中国站在一起。我们也在用毛泽东思想武装自己，如果你们胆敢妄为，你们在英国也将遭到毁灭性的打击。”
    一位印度人在会上说：“今天我们心里充满了喜悦。我们感到高兴，因为毛主席通过无产阶级文化大革命保证了中国永不变色。这是毛主席在巩固无产阶级专政方面的伟大贡献。”
