In a corner of the Chengdu Thermal Power Plant, there is an unassuming workshop called the Fuel and Transportation Yard. The work here is the dirtiest and hardest. In the past, the plant's capitalist roaders never came here.

As soon as the Revolutionary Committee was established, one day a group of people suddenly arrived. Some were in military uniforms, and others were in work clothes. As soon as they arrived, they picked up their tools and started doing the dirtiest and hardest jobs.

Who were they? The workers gathered around to take a look and found out that they were all members of the plant's Revolutionary Committee and the PLA leftist support personnel. The workers asked, "Why did you come here to work?" They replied, "The labor here is the hardest and most glorious. We came to learn from everyone and treat this place as a great furnace for the revolutionization of our thoughts." Immediately, the Fuel and Transportation Yard echoed with the song "Long Live the Revolutionary Committee." The members of the Revolutionary Committee, the PLA comrades, and the workers launched a labor competition. The coal dust flew, and after working for a while, everyone was sweating profusely and covered in black from head to toe. When they got tired, they studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Cadres should participate in collective production labor to maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism." After studying, everyone suddenly felt their strength doubled. They said, "We must treat the Fuel and Transportation Yard as a great furnace for the revolutionization of our thoughts, forge an unyielding red heart for Chairman Mao, cultivate a style of close contact with the masses, and always maintain the character of an ordinary laborer."

The Fuel and Transportation Yard became the base for the Revolutionary Committee members to labor regularly. The head of the Revolutionary Committee, Li Hong, often labored here. Comrade Li Hong is an old cadre. When he was the director of this plant, his bureaucratic style was quite serious. Today, he labored with the workers, and when he was sweating profusely and covered in black, he recalled his past experiences in the old liberated areas, where he herded cattle and pigs with poor and lower-middle peasants, and tilled the land with a hoe. He sighed deeply, "At that time, I was both an 'official' and a 'commoner,' and my heart was connected with the masses. We had no secrets from each other. But after moving to the city, I gradually stopped laboring, and my thoughts also changed day by day. Not only did I become content with high positions and rich rewards, and enjoy a life of ease, but I also liked to give orders and scold people, becoming more and more detached from the masses." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on cadres participating in collective production labor and maintaining close contact with the masses, and with the help of the worker masses, thoroughly criticized his past bureaucratic style, and resolved to reform himself in labor and among the masses. Therefore, after this more than fifty-year-old old cadre was elected as the head of the Revolutionary Committee by the workers, he still worked like the young fellows, taking on the dirtiest and hardest jobs. One day, to repair the overhead crane in the Fuel and Transportation Yard, he and the workers started working from the afternoon and continued until 5 a.m. the next day. His waist ached, and his arms went numb, but he and the workers together loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory." Finally, the overhead crane, which had not been repaired for more than two months, was repaired in one night. Over the past few months, no matter how busy Li Hong was with his work, he always came to the Fuel and Transportation Yard to labor on a regular basis. In labor, he established a deep proletarian friendship with the worker masses, and the workers had no secrets from him, becoming bosom friends. The workers happily said to him, "Old Li! You have changed, from the past director who blew his beard and bulged his eyes, to an old worker who is always sweating." He said, "I want the sweat of labor to thoroughly wash away the dust of bureaucratism from my body and always be a student of the masses."

Comrade Li Hong and other members of the Revolutionary Committee deeply felt that to "organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is linked with the masses," in-service cadres must be sent down to labor in batches. At the same time, cadres who remain at their posts must also insist on participating in collective production labor regularly, accept re-education from the workers in labor, promote the revolutionization of their thoughts, and maintain close contact with the worker masses.

    用劳动的汗水冲刷官僚主义灰尘
    ——记成都热电厂革命委员会委员参加集体生产劳动的故事
    在成都热电厂的一角，有个不引人注目的车间，名叫燃运场。这里的工作最脏最累。过去，厂里的走资派从不到这里来。
    革命委员会一成立，有一天突然来了一群人。他们有的穿着军装，有的穿着工作服，一到这儿就拿起工具，挑最脏最累的活儿干了起来。
    他们是谁？工人们围拢来一看，原来厂革委会的成员和驻厂解放军支左人员全都来了。工人们问：“你们怎么跑这儿来干活？”他们说：“这里劳动最艰苦，也最光荣。我们来向大家学习，把这里当成思想革命化的大熔炉。”顿时，燃运场上响起了“革命委员会好”的歌声。革委会成员、解放军同志和工人们展开了劳动竞赛。这里煤灰飞扬，大家干了一会儿，就汗如雨下，浑身上下一团黑。干累了，他们就学习毛主席的伟大教导：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”一学习，大家顿时浑身力量倍增。他们说，我们要把燃运场当作思想革命化的大熔炉，铸炼无限忠于毛主席的红心，锻炼紧密联系群众的作风，永远保持普通劳动者的本色。
    燃运场成了革委会成员经常劳动的基地。革委会主任李洪经常在这里劳动。李洪同志是个老干部。原来他在这个厂当厂长时，官僚主义作风比较严重。今天，他同工人一起劳动，在汗流浃背，浑身是黑的时候，回忆起了自己从前在老解放区和贫下中农一起放牛放猪，挥锄种地的情景。他深有感慨地说：“那时自己既是‘官’，又是民，和群众心心相连，无话不谈。但进城以后，自己一天天脱离劳动了，思想也就一天天变了。不仅安于高官厚禄，养尊处优，而且喜欢指手划脚，训人骂人，越来越脱离了群众。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，他反复学习了毛主席关于干部参加集体生产劳动和密切联系群众的伟大教导，在工人群众的帮助下，彻底批判了自己过去脱离群众的官老爷作风，决心在劳动中，在群众中，重新改造自己。因此，这位五十多岁的老干部被工人选为革委会主任以后，在劳动中仍然象小伙子们那样，抢干最脏最累的活。有一天，为了抢修燃运场上的龙门吊车，他和工人一起，从下午开始，一直干到第二天凌晨五点钟。腰疼了，手臂麻了，他就和工人们一起高声朗诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”终于把过去两个多月没修好的龙门吊车，在一夜之间就修好了。几个月来，李洪不管工作多忙，都毫不例外地定期来燃运场参加劳动。在劳动中，他和工人群众建立了深厚的无产阶级感情，工人们对他无话不谈，成了知心朋友。工人们高兴地对他说：“老李啊！你变了，由过去吹胡子瞪眼睛的厂长，变成了汗水常淌的老工人。”他说：“我要让劳动的汗水，彻底冲刷掉我身上的官僚主义灰尘，永远当群众的小学生。”
    李洪同志和革委会的其他成员深深地体会到，要“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，在职干部一定要分批下放劳动。同时，留在工作岗位上的干部，也必须经常坚持参加集体生产劳动，在劳动中接受工人的再教育，促进思想革命化，密切和工人群众的联系。
