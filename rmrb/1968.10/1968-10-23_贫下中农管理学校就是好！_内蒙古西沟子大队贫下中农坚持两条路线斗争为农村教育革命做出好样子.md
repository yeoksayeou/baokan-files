Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Managing Schools Is Good!
— The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants of Xigouzi Production Brigade in Inner Mongolia Persist in the Struggle Between the Two Lines and Set a Good Example for the Rural Educational Revolution

The Xigouzi Production Brigade of Xindianzi People's Commune in Anding County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is a mountainous area. In 1965, the poor and lower-middle peasants here established a "junior high school with an elementary school attached" agricultural middle school. They ran the school for over three years, experiencing many twists and turns, and accumulated some experience in running the school.

Completely Shattering the Monopoly of Intellectuals

(1) In the first three years, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi Production Brigade tried every means to support the agricultural middle school from all sides, putting in a lot of effort. However, the school, under the control of bourgeois intellectuals, became increasingly unpopular and drifted further away from the poor and lower-middle peasants. This spring, the poor and lower-middle peasants directly entered the school to take control, and the situation immediately changed dramatically. Their experience was: poor and lower-middle peasants running schools must enter the school to take control, manage everything, and completely shatter the monopoly of intellectuals.

In 1965, Xigouzi Production Brigade had 46 graduates from elementary school. Due to the barriers set by the revisionist educational line, more than 30 of the poor and lower-middle peasants' children could not go to middle school. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi Production Brigade decided to add a junior high school class to the original Xigouzi Elementary School and run their own agricultural middle school. There were no classrooms, so the brigade provided an office; there were no dormitories, so the poor and lower-middle peasants vacated rooms; there was no funding, so the brigade allocated public funds. They hoped that the intellectuals could run the school well and invited the person in charge of the original Xigouzi Elementary School to manage it. The school opened in July of that year.

However, by April 1966, the agricultural middle school, which the poor and lower-middle peasants had worked so hard to establish, collapsed after only nine months. Why did it collapse? It was because the running dogs of the capitalist class who controlled the county's educational system opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and vigorously promoted the reactionary revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi, spreading the reactionary fallacies of "studying to advance" and "studying to become an official." They insisted that the agricultural middle school should align with so-called "regular" middle schools. The intellectuals, whose worldview had not been transformed, kept the students locked in the classroom, buried in books, and blatantly indoctrinated them: "Study hard, and when you master this bit of knowledge from the teachers, you can avoid labor and earn dozens of yuan a month in the future." Those students poisoned by the fallacies of "studying to advance and become an official" looked down on this "irregular" agricultural middle school, feeling that studying here had no guarantee of advancement and no future prospects. They tried every means to transfer to "regular" schools. With the support of the running dogs of the capitalist class in the county, the intellectuals in power also opposed students participating in productive labor. On one hand, they said, "Students come to school to learn knowledge, not to suffer." On the other hand, in the little agricultural labor class they had, they promoted economism and corrupted the students, saying, "Work hard, and if you do well, you'll get a new set of clothes." They divided 90% of the labor fruits among the teachers and students. This revisionist practice poisoned some students, who simply did not attend the agricultural middle school and went out to find odd jobs to make money. Most of the poor and lower-middle peasant students were very dissatisfied with these evil practices. They said, "Attending such a school wastes farm work, doesn't teach anything, and instead teaches bad things. Why bother coming to school?" No one wanted to attend school anymore.

Facing this situation, the Party branch of Xigouzi Production Brigade held a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants for discussion. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Running the agricultural middle school is our wish, and the agricultural middle school cannot collapse; it must be run. However, running it like before is not acceptable." They mobilized students from various places to return to the agricultural middle school and led the teachers and students to carry beams from the mountains to repair the buildings. At that time, although the poor and lower-middle peasants were dissatisfied with the intellectuals managing the agricultural middle school, they thought that since ancient times, it had always been those who understood literature and knew how to read and write who managed schools. Therefore, they only had the Party branch secretary, Comrade Wang Baocai, represent everyone to repeatedly go to the person in charge of the agricultural middle school to convey the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, criticize and help, and come up with many good ideas, asking them to run the school according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. In this way, in May 1966, the Xigouzi Agricultural Middle School reopened under the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of teachers and students made a revolutionary uproar, but due to the impact of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, the agricultural middle school was dismantled again. After Chairman Mao's latest instruction to resume classes and make revolution came down, the school still could not keep up. In August 1967, the Party branch of Xigouzi Production Brigade held another meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants and decided to send people to help the agricultural middle school immediately resume classes and make revolution. The brigade's cadres and representatives of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association gathered the teachers and students, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and launched a revolutionary big criticism. The agricultural middle school immediately became lively. The representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants saw that resuming classes and making revolution had a good start and left the school. However, the intellectuals whose worldview had not been transformed again put on their "authority" and said, "What are you jumping around for! It's still me who teaches!" They turned resuming classes into "restoring the old," restoring the old order and old curriculum of revisionist education, "classes, homework, algebra, geometry." Not long after, the agricultural middle school collapsed for the third time.

From the living facts of the agricultural middle school rising and falling three times, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi understood a truth: the school could no longer be handed over to intellectuals. Relying solely on intellectuals could not run a school that served the poor and lower-middle peasants. The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the school must be completely changed. The Party branch of Xigouzi Production Brigade held another discussion with the poor and lower-middle peasants and decided that the agricultural middle school they ran themselves would be managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. On April 10 of this year, they sent representatives into the agricultural middle school and established a revolutionary committee of the Xigouzi Agricultural Middle School, with the poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives as the president and vice-president, taking control of everything. The high tide of the educational revolution in the agricultural middle school followed.

Overcoming Old Habits and Firmly Grasping the Power of Education

(2) The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi Production Brigade entered the agricultural middle school to take control, but the class enemies were not willing to give up, and the poison of the revisionist educational line was still at work. Some intellectuals whose worldview had not been transformed were not convinced. The poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions on poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools, went through a fierce struggle for the power of education, stood firm, and took the first step. Their experience was: after the poor and lower-middle peasants entered the school, they must unite with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, fight against the reactionary revisionist educational line, and fight against all class enemies. They must also educate and transform intellectuals and overcome old habits. Only in this way can they firmly grasp the power of education.

Comrade Wang Baocai, the Party branch secretary and old poor peasant of Xigouzi Production Brigade, became the president of the agricultural middle school revolutionary committee, and Comrade Sun Sanhai, another old poor peasant, became the vice-president. As soon as they entered the agricultural middle school, the counterattacks of the revisionist educational line began.

Creating public opinion, spreading cold winds, saying, "Peasants have no culture or knowledge, blindly managing schools, they can't do it well!" This is one kind; dispersing the poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools, sending away students who came to register, trying to make it impossible for you to run it, this is another kind; not cooperating, the intellectuals who were originally in power not working with the poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out the educational revolution, bullying the poor and lower-middle peasants for being "outsiders," trying to take back the power, this is yet another kind; "You manage people, I manage teaching," trying to make the poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives run errands while they themselves hold the real power of education, and use the revisionist educational line to rule the school, this is another kind. All these are attempts to restore the revisionist educational line.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi Production Brigade and the broad revolutionary teachers and students of the agricultural middle school launched a counterattack. Inside and outside the school, and even throughout the brigade, a revolutionary big criticism movement was launched, fiercely criticizing the revisionist educational line, strengthening the dictatorship over those who had not been transformed—landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists—and cleaning up the teacher team. It was in the midst of this struggle that the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao came: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi were overjoyed, having the greatest support from Chairman Mao and the most powerful weapon given by Chairman Mao, the poor and lower-middle peasants grasping the power of education had the most reliable guarantee.

Wang Baocai and Sun Sanhai, the two representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, were filled with confidence and determination to manage the power of education well. They said, "Although we two together can't write a full person's name, we have a red sun in our hearts, and we are unobstructed in the face of difficulties. Hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we will carry them out. We have no culture, so we speak from experience. We can't read, but we want to tell the student children the reason for not being able to read and not forgetting the bitterness of the poor and lower-middle peasants. With Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we will definitely manage this school."

The poor and lower-middle peasants strongly supported them, instructing their representatives, "Whatever the school needs to do, you just say it. If it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, we will firmly support it and definitely run the agricultural middle school well." They allocated a nursery, 40 mu of land, and a set of oxen to the agricultural middle school, establishing an agricultural middle school farm, and sent poor and lower-middle peasants to teach them hands-on.

Comrade Zhang Pinghai, the former chairman of the agricultural cooperative and now a member of the three-in-one leading group of Xigouzi Production Brigade, was so excited by Chairman Mao's instructions to have the poor and lower-middle peasants manage schools that he couldn't sleep all night. Twelve years ago, he went to the teachers to discuss the matter of poor and lower-middle peasants' children going to school, but he was ridiculed and slandered by the bad elements who controlled the school at that time, making him so angry that he couldn't sleep all night. Now, with Chairman Mao's support, Zhang Pinghai often rushed to the agricultural middle school, firmly criticizing the revisionist educational line and fighting against class enemies head-on.

Old poor peasant Li Er, who was most dissatisfied with the agricultural middle school in the past, was now entrusted by everyone to happily go to the agricultural middle school to teach. Many poor and lower-middle peasants went to the school to teach classes on class education and Mao Zedong Thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi not only managed but also taught, occupying the podium.

The revolutionary teachers and students who had been tempered by the Cultural Revolution also welcomed the poor and lower-middle peasants the most, were most willing to learn farming with the poor and lower-middle peasants, liked listening to the poor and lower-middle peasants' lectures the most, and were most obedient to the poor and lower-middle peasants' management.

A unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed dozens of miles away also actively sent soldiers to help with military training and the educational revolution.

The counterattacks of the revisionist educational line and the struggles of the class enemies were suppressed. Those who were bound by old habits and had doubts about the poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools also raised their awareness in the struggle for the power to run the school against the revisionist educational line and saw the power of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Through this struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi Production Brigade firmly grasped the power of education and managed everything in the agricultural middle school. However, they did not become complacent and were determined to fight to the end against the revisionist educational line and all class enemies' attempts to restore the old order in the educational front.

Running the School According to Chairman Mao's Educational Line and Cultivating Revolutionary Successors

(3) The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi Production Brigade have managed the agricultural middle school for only half a year, and the school has undergone a complete transformation, full of vitality, implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said, "If we run it like this, our descendants will not change color, and there will be successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause. This is the school for our poor and lower-middle peasants' children." Their experience was: the school managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants must be run according to Chairman Mao's educational line, completely serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, and cultivating laborers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have socialist consciousness, and are cultured.

In the past half year, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi managed the agricultural middle school, mainly focusing on six major tasks:

First, grasp the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, keeping up with Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi said, "Sending children to school, the first thing is to learn the works of Chairman Mao, have a good ideology, not only for the students themselves to learn well, but also to help the adults at home learn." Therefore, when the representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants entered the agricultural middle school, the first thing they did was to hold large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes and fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism together with the teachers and students, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions came, they learned and applied them, and formed propaganda teams to go to each production team and each household to propagate to the poor and lower-middle peasants. The Chinese language class was to learn Chairman Mao's works and poems. Teachers and students also formed many groups to serve as tutors in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes of each production team, reading Chairman Mao's works to the poor and lower-middle peasants while being educated by the poor and lower-middle peasants' learning.

Second, grasp the remembrance of bitterness education and participate in class struggle. They regarded class education as the root education for students and attached great importance to it. On one hand, they often invited old poor peasants with deep bitterness to the school to talk about their family history and village history, and sent teachers and students to each production team to visit the poor and inquire about their bitterness, investigating the class struggle history of the village. On the other hand, they organized teachers and students to join the poor and lower-middle peasants in carrying out struggles against the enemy, launching a revolutionary big criticism, struggling against and criticizing those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been transformed, and being educated in the practice of class struggle. When the production brigade captured two historical counter-revolutionaries who had fled, the agricultural middle school students formed a shock team to assist. A student from the agricultural middle school in Houyagou discovered that a landlord in their village was not honest, scolded him on the spot, and suggested to the production team to supervise him strictly. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "In the past, the schools controlled by Liu Shaoqi and his agents not only did not carry out class education but also filled our children with a lot of revisionist goods; now that we poor and lower-middle peasants manage the school ourselves, we must carry out class education well."

Third, grasp production labor and run the school through self-reliance. In addition to running their own small farm, the agricultural middle school also participated extensively in the collective labor of the production brigade. Every Sunday, each production team arranged farm work for the teachers and students. Teachers and students, while working with the poor and lower-middle peasants, raised their political awareness, cultivated a labor perspective, and learned agricultural skills. The teachers and students also made bricks, built walls, plastered rooms, thatched roofs, painted blackboards, and repaired desks and chairs to build the school. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised, "This is how to cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause."

Fourth, grasp wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. In July of this year, the production team needed to go to Shanxi to pull coal, but the fodder was not prepared. The agricultural middle school heard about it and mobilized all the teachers and students to cut grass for a day, immediately solving the fodder problem. In front of the agricultural middle school, there was a ridge, steep and often blocked by the commune's vehicles. In the past, the school stood by and did not help, but now the teachers and students saw the vehicles crossing the ridge and immediately went out to help the poor and lower-middle peasants push the carts. The teachers not only managed teaching but also often discussed the affairs of the production team with the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, helping with the work. The 19 graduates this year all willingly returned to the production team for long-term productive labor. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very satisfied and said, "Now, the school is connected with the production team."

Fifth, grasp teaching from the needs of the countryside. They proposed, "Less study during busy farming seasons and more study during idle farming seasons," changing the past semester system that was detached from the actual production of the countryside. In the past, when there was urgent work in the brigade, the agricultural middle school was asked to help, but it was not allowed, saying, "Stopping class for one day requires the district to approve, two days the county to approve, and three days to report to the league." The poor and lower-middle peasants abolished this rigid rule. In May of this year, the brigade rushed to repair a large canal to irrigate the fields, and the weather station forecasted a heavy rain. The brigade decided to stop classes for the agricultural middle school to rush the work, helping to complete the canal before the heavy rain. The poor and lower-middle peasants also abolished the past examination system and grading system of the school. They said, "In the past, school examinations only examined labor and practice, but only looked at adjectives and nouns to see how many there were, and the more there were, the higher the score. Our poor and lower-middle peasants' children speak the truth, and we don't need those flowery words." In terms of courses, they first ensured that the study of Chairman Mao's works was placed at the top. At the same time, they studied politics and culture, selected useful courses in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and added financial courses needed in the countryside. The production brigade had a diesel engine, and this year's graduating class learned the operation and maintenance of the diesel engine.

Sixth, grasp the establishment of a teacher team of their own poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigouzi believed that teachers of what class would implement the educational line of what class and cultivate students of what class. Therefore, they especially valued the establishment of a teacher team that held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, was determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end, was willing to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, had rich practical experience, and was dominated by poor and lower-middle peasants. They removed one bad element from the original teacher team and strengthened the re-education of the original teachers who were willing to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. At the same time, they selected four teachers from the poor and lower-middle peasants of their own village, including one old poor peasant, Li Er, and the other three were poor and lower-middle peasants' children who were good in thought and labor, as well as young people who had graduated from middle school and participated in labor in their own village. These teachers, including the new teachers and the original teachers who were left, all satisfied the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    贫下中农管理学校就是好！
    ——内蒙古西沟子大队贫下中农坚持两条路线斗争为农村教育革命做出好样子
    内蒙古自治区和林县新店子公社西沟子大队是个山区。一九六五年，这里的贫下中农自办了一座“小学戴帽”的农业中学。他们自办农中三年多，几经波折，积累了一些办学的经验。
    彻底打破知识分子独霸的一统天下
    （一）前三年，西沟子大队贫下中农想方设法从各方面去关心、扶植农中，力量没少下，可是学校在资产阶级知识分子手里越办越不景气，越办离贫下中农越远。今年春，贫下中农直接进校掌了权，面貌马上发生根本变化。他们的体会是：贫下中农办学校，就是要进校掌权，管理一切，彻底打破知识分子独霸的一统天下。
    一九六五年，西沟子大队有四十六名高小毕业生，由于修正主义教育路线设下的关卡，使得其中的三十多名贫下中农子女上不了中学。西沟子大队贫下中农便决定在原西沟子小学加设一个初中班，自办了农中。没课堂，大队让出办公室；没宿舍，贫下中农腾房；没经费，大队拨出公积金。他们满指望那些知识分子能好好办学，请原西沟子小学的负责人管起来。这年的七月，农中就开学了。
    谁知到了一九六六年四月，贫下中农热心操办起来的农中才办了九个月就垮了。为啥垮了？就是因为上有县里文教系统的走资派掌权，下有资产阶级世界观没有改造的知识分子管理学校。县里文教系统的走资派疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，拚命推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，大肆鼓吹“读书升学”、“读书做官”的反动谬论，硬要农中向所谓的“正规”中学看齐，而世界观没有改造好的知识分子就要学生整天关在教室里，埋在书堆中，赤裸裸地向学生灌输：“你们好好念吧，能把老师这点知识学到了，将来就可以不劳动，每月挣上几十元钱了。”那些受了“读书升学当干部”的谬论毒害的学生，就对这座不“正规”的农中看不上眼了，觉得在这样的学校念书，“升学没把握”，“前途没指望”，想方设法往“正规”学校走。在县里走资派的支持下，掌权的知识分子还反对学生参加生产劳动。一方面说什么：“学生来学校是学知识的，不是来受苦的。”另方面在仅有的一点点农业劳动课中，大搞经济主义，腐蚀学生。说什么“你们好好干吧，干好了一人换一身新衣服。”把劳动果实的百分之九十都分到师生个人手里。这种修正主义的做法毒害了一些学生，干脆不上农中，外出找零活挣钱去了。大多数的贫下中农学生，则对这些恶劣作法非常不满，他们说，上这样的学校，既误农活，又学不到东西，反而往坏里学，上学干什么？谁也不愿来上学了。
    面对这种情况，西沟子大队党支部召开贫下中农大会进行讨论。贫下中农说：“办农中是我们的愿望，农中不能垮，可得办下去。不过，象前段那么办可不成。”他们把学生从各处动员回农中，又领着师生进山扛回檩木，修缮了房舍。当时，贫下中农虽然对管农中的知识分子不满意，可是以为自古以来都是懂文识字的人管学校，所以只是由党支部书记王保才同志代表大伙儿几次三番去找农中负责人传达贫下中农的意见，又批评又帮助，还出了好多好主意，让他们好好按毛主席的指示，按贫下中农的意见办学。就这样，一九六六年五月，西沟子农中又在贫下中农的扶植下开学了。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，广大师生闹革命轰轰烈烈，可是由于受到资产阶级反动路线的冲击，又把农中弄散架了。毛主席复课闹革命的最新指示下来后，学校还是跟不上。一九六七年八月，西沟子大队党支部又一次召开贫下中农大会，决定派人帮助农中立即复课闹革命。大队的干部、贫协的代表把师生找到一起，活学活用毛主席的最新指示，开展革命大批判。农中立时就搞得热气腾腾。贫下中农代表看见复课闹革命有了个好开头，便离开了学校。不料，世界观没有改造好的知识分子又摆起了“权威”架势：“你们跳甚！还不是得我来教！”把复课变成“复旧”，恢复了修正主义教育的旧秩序、旧课程，“上课，下课，代数，几何”。没过多久，农中又第三次瘫痪了。
    从农中三起三落的活生生事实中，西沟子贫下中农懂得了一个理：学校再不能交给知识分子管了，单靠知识分子办不出能为贫下中农服务的学校，必须彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象。西沟子大队党支部又一次召集贫下中农讨论，决定自办的农中由贫下中农自己来管。今年四月十日，他们派出代表进入农中，建立了一个由贫下中农代表担任正、副主任的西沟子农中革委会，掌管一切。农中的教育革命高潮随之而起。
    战胜旧的习惯势力　牢牢掌握文权
    （二）西沟子大队贫下中农进农中掌权，阶级敌人不甘心，修正主义教育路线的流毒仍然在起作用，一些世界观没改造好的知识分子不服气。贫下中农以毛主席的贫下中农管理学校的最新指示为武器，经过一场激烈的争夺教育权的阶级斗争，稳住了脚，迈开了步。他们的体会是：贫下中农进了学校，要团结广大革命师生，和反革命修正主义教育路线斗，和一切阶级敌人斗，还要教育改造知识分子，战胜旧的习惯势力。这样，才能牢牢掌住文权。
    西沟子大队党支部书记、老贫农王保才同志担任了农中革委会主任，老贫农孙三孩担任了副主任。他俩一进农中，修正主义教育路线的种种反扑就开始了。
    制造舆论，刮阴风，说什么“庄户人文化没文化，知识没知识，瞎汉管学校，管不好！”这是一种；拆贫下中农管学校的台，把前来报到的学生打发走，想让你办不起来，这是又一种；不合作，原来掌权的知识分子不和贫下中农一起搞教育革命，欺侮贫下中农“外行”，想再把权拿回来，这是再一种；“你们管叫人，我管教书”，想让贫下中农代表跑跑腿，而自己执掌教育实权，再用修正主义教育路线去统治学校，这又是一种。凡此种种，都是修正主义教育路线的复辟企图。
    西沟子大队贫下中农和农中广大革命师生奋起反击。校里，校外，以至全大队内，掀起了革命大批判的热潮，狠批修正主义教育路线，加强了对没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右的专政，清理教师队伍。正是在斗争当中，传来了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”西沟子贫下中农欣喜若狂，有了毛主席的最大支持，有了毛主席给的最有力的武器，贫下中农掌文权就有了最牢靠的保证。
    王保才和孙三孩这两个贫下中农代表，充满了掌好文权的信心和决心。他们说：“我俩虽然合起来写不全一个人的名字，但是心中有个红太阳，困难面前无阻挡。听到毛主席的最新指示，咱就照办。没文化咱讲实际，不识字，咱就是要给学生娃娃讲不识字的原因，不忘贫下中农的阶级苦。有了毛主席的最新指示，这学校咱管定了。”
    贫下中农大力支持，嘱咐自己的代表说：“学校要办啥事，你们尽管讲，符合毛泽东思想咱就坚决支持，一定把农中搞好。”他们给农中拨了一座苗圃，四十亩地，一副牛具，办起了一个农中农场，还派贫下中农来手把手地教。
    当年的老农会主任，现在西沟子大队三结合领导小组成员张平孩，听到毛主席要贫下中农管学校的指示，激动得一夜没有睡着。十二年前的一天，他为了贫下中农子女上学的事，热心地去找教师商议，结果受到了当时把持学校的坏分子的奚落和诬蔑，气得他一夜没睡。现在有毛主席撑腰，张平孩抽空就往农中跑，坚决批判修正主义教育路线，同阶级敌人针锋相对地斗。
    老贫农李二过去对农中最不满意，现在受大伙儿委托满心高兴地到农中来当教师。还有好多贫下中农到学校去讲阶级教育课、毛泽东思想课。西沟子贫下中农不仅管，而且教，占领了讲台。
    经过文化大革命锻炼的革命师生也最欢迎贫下中农，最愿意跟贫下中农学农活，最喜欢听贫下中农讲课，最服从贫下中农的管理。
    驻在几十里外的解放军某部队也主动派来战士，帮助搞军训，帮助搞教育革命。
    修正主义教育路线的反扑，阶级敌人的挣扎被打下去了。少数受旧的习惯势力束缚，对贫下中农管学校有怀疑的人，也在和修正主义教育路线争夺办学权的斗争中，提高了认识，看到了贫下中农的威力。
    西沟子大队贫下中农通过这场斗争，牢牢掌住了文权，在农中管理着一切。但是，他们并不因此而麻痹，决心要在教育阵地上同修正主义教育路线和一切阶级敌人的复辟企图斗争到底。
    按毛主席教育路线办学　培养革命接班人
    （三）西沟子大队贫下中农管理农中才半年，学校就一改旧貌，朝气蓬勃，贯彻了毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。贫下中农高兴地说：“这么办下去，咱们的后代变不了色，无产阶级革命事业有接班人了。这才是咱们贫下中农子女上的学校。”他们的体会是：贫下中农管理的学校，要坚决按照毛主席的教育路线办，彻底为贫下中农服务，培养用毛泽东思想武装起来的有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    这半年当中，西沟子贫下中农管理农中，主要是抓了六件大事：
    一抓活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的最新指示。西沟子贫下中农说：“送子女上学，头一样就是为了学毛主席著作，有个好思想，不光学生自己学好，还得回家帮助大人学。”所以，贫下中农代表进农中，第一件事就是大办毛泽东思想学习班，和师生一起斗私批修，活学活用毛泽东思想。毛主席的最新指示一来就学，学了就用，还组成宣传队到各生产队各家各户去向贫下中农宣传。语文课就是学毛主席的著作、诗词。师生还分成好多组，在生产队的联户毛泽东思想学习班当辅导员，一边给贫下中农念毛主席著作，一边从贫下中农的学习中受教育。
    二抓忆苦教育，参加阶级斗争。他们把阶级教育看作是对学生扎根子的教育，非常重视。一方面，经常请苦大仇深的老贫农来校讲家史、村史，把师生分到各生产队去访贫问苦，调查本村的阶级斗争史。另方面组织师生和贫下中农一起开展对敌斗争，开展革命大批判，批斗没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，在阶级斗争的实践中受教育。生产大队捉拿两名畏罪潜逃的历史反革命分子，农中学生就组成突击队去配合。后瓦窑沟的一名农中学生，发现本村地主不老实，当场训斥，并向生产队提出从严监督的建议。贫下中农说：“过去中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人把持的学校，不但不搞阶级教育，还给咱娃娃灌了好多修正主义货色；现在咱贫下中农自己管理学校，可得好好抓阶级教育。”
    三抓生产劳动，自力更生办校。农中除搞自己小农场外，还大量参加生产大队的集体劳动。每个星期天，各生产队都为师生安排农活。师生在和贫下中农一起劳动中，提高政治觉悟，培养劳动观点，学习农业技能。师生们还自己脱坯、打墙、抹房、糊棚、刷黑板、修桌凳，修建学校。贫下中农称赞说：“这才是培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    四抓全心全意为贫下中农服务。今年七月，生产队要出车去山西拉煤，畜草没准备好。农中听说了，就出动全体师生打了一天草，一下子就解决了畜草问题。农中门前有道梁，坡陡，常有社里来往的大车过不去。过去学校袖手旁观不帮助，现在师生一见大车过梁，就一齐出动帮贫下中农推车。教师不但管教学，还经常和生产队干部、贫下中农一起商量生产队的事，帮助工作。今年毕业的十九名学生，都乐意回生产队长期生产劳动。贫下中农很满意地说：“现在，学校和生产队联系通了。”
    五抓教学从农村需要出发。他们提出：“农忙少学，农闲多学”，改变了过去脱离农村生产实际的学期制度。过去大队里有紧活，要农中帮忙，就不行，说是“停学一天要学区批，两天县里批，三天要报盟里批”。贫下中农把这个死规矩废了。今年五月，大队抢修大渠引洪灌田，气象站预告有暴雨，大队就决定农中停课去突击，帮助把大渠在暴雨前修好了。贫下中农还取消了学校过去的考试制度、分数制度。他们说：“过去学校考试，就是不考劳动，不考实践，只看形容词、名词多就好，分数就多。咱贫下中农子女讲实实在在，不要那些花言巧语。”课程上，首先保证把毛主席著作学习放在首位。同时，又学政治，又学文化，数理化课挑有用的上，增加了农村需要的财会课程。生产大队有柴油机，今年的毕业班就学习了柴油机的操作和检修。
    六抓建立一支贫下中农自己的教师队伍。西沟子贫下中农认为：什么阶级的教师，执行什么阶级的教育路线，培养什么阶级的学生。所以，他们特别重视建立一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底，热心为贫下中农服务，又富于实践经验，并且贫下中农成份占优势的教师队伍。他们从原有的教师队伍中清除了一名坏分子，对原有的愿意为贫下中农服务的教师加强再教育。同时由贫下中农从本村选拔了四名教师，其中一名是老贫农李二，其余三名都是思想好、劳动好的贫下中农子女，还有中学毕业后在本村参加劳动的青年。这些教师，包括新教师和原来留下的教师，都为贫下中农所满意。
