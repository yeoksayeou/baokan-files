    A Great Revolution in the Soul
    —Basic Experiences from Establishing the Liuhe "May 7th" Cadres School
    Black Dragon River Province Liuhe "May 7th" Cadres School Revolutionary Committee

    On May 7th of this year, on the glorious day marking the second anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive, the Black Dragon River Provincial Revolutionary Committee organized a group of cadres from the original provincial-level agencies to be sent down for labor. In the Jiang'an County Liuhe Machine Farm, a "May 7th" Cadres School was established.

    Chairman Mao recently instructed us, "A large number of cadres should be sent down for labor. This is an excellent opportunity for cadres to re-learn. Except for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also be sent down in batches for labor." After five months of revolutionary practice, we deeply feel that Chairman Mao's instructions are extremely wise and correct. Chairman Mao's brilliant directive will forever illuminate our path forward.

    The Brilliant "May 7th" Directive is the Fundamental Policy for Running the School

    When preparing to establish the "May 7th" Cadres School, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee clearly pointed out: The "May 7th" Cadres School must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th" Directive as the guideline, take the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example, and on the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, reform one's worldview, and cultivate a batch of new people who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, can go up and down, can be officials and common people, can be workers and peasants, and can be both intellectuals and soldiers.

    Chairman Mao taught us: "The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." From the day the "May 7th" Cadres School was born, it has been engaged in a sharp struggle over the direction of the school and what kind of cadres school to establish. At the beginning of the school's establishment, when the students, following Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive, with great enthusiasm and determination, went on an expedition to open up wasteland and began the intense spring plowing, someone proposed: "Cadres school, cadres school, by its very name, should look like a school, should open several courses, should study systematically." This argument was aimed at changing the fundamental direction of the "May 7th" Cadres School. We immediately seized this issue and launched a school-wide debate, vigorously promoting "three educations and one criticism." The three educations are: education on Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive, education on the traditions of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and class education. The one criticism is: a thorough criticism of the revisionist cadre education line of China's Khrushchev.

    Through this debate, we defended Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive and corrected the direction of the school. The students pointed out: The proposal to open several courses and study systematically is essentially to restore the old party school's "three separations" (separation from reality, separation from the masses, separation from production labor) and engage in closed-door cultivation. We absolutely cannot do this. We must follow Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive and establish a brand-new, revolutionary cadres school.

    Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive became a great material force. The students studied politics, military affairs, and culture, engaged in mass work, and criticized the bourgeoisie. They started from scratch, worked hard to build the school, took agriculture as the main focus, and engaged in industry, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline businesses. The entire school presented a vibrant and prosperous new situation.

    In the struggle against nature, the students linked every action to implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive. Wherever there was hardship, they charged forward. Their feet blistered, their hands calloused, and everyone deeply felt: This is the best kind of learning, this is revolution.

    However, the struggle did not end there. After a while, another argument emerged. Someone said: "Cadres school, cadres school, is a school for doing manual labor. Learn farming well, become a laborer, and that's enough." These people buried their heads in labor, delved deeply into technology, rushed forward in labor but sat back in meetings, relaxing their ideological transformation. They said, "There is a Revolutionary Committee above and a rebel faction below. You come up with the ideas, you lead the team. I'll just do some work, it's easy and comfortable."

    We believe: This argument is to turn the "May 7th" Cadres School into a "safe haven" for class struggle, attempting to change the fundamental direction of the "May 7th" Cadres School from another angle. In response to this situation, we organized another school-wide debate. At that time, it was the busy season for harvesting wheat, and many people couldn't sit still. They were busy sharpening their sickles and anxiously told the Revolutionary Committee members, "The harvest is urgent, let's go cut the wheat quickly!" We believe that sharpening the sickle starts with sharpening one's thoughts. We made a firm decision to concentrate for four days on the debate over the direction of the "May 7th" Cadres School. The students firmly said: "We absolutely cannot turn the school into an old-style farm that only focuses on production and profits." "We are not just taking a labor course; more importantly, we are taking a course to implement Chairman Mao's 'May 7th' Directive. We are not just passing a labor test; more importantly, we are passing the test of socialist revolution." Through this debate, the fundamental direction of the "May 7th" Cadres School was further corrected, and the "May 7th" Cadres School advanced in big strides along the path indicated by Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive.

    The "May 7th" Cadres School is a place for "forging people." In the school, all activities revolve around the issue of transforming one's worldview. The students' production labor, study, military training, and daily life are all closely linked to implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive and forging a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Battlefield rectification, field lectures, praise meetings, battle evaluations, and criticism meetings have become voluntary institutions for the students of the "May 7th" Cadres School. The students' atmosphere for studying Chairman Mao's works has become thicker, their proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao have deepened, and their desire to transform their worldview has become stronger. The students all say: With Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive guiding us, we can forge a path to prevent and combat revisionism in the wilderness!

    Transforming the Worldview is the Fundamental Task of Running the School

    Chairman Mao taught us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, continuing the revolution fundamentally is to solve the problem of people's worldviews. The transformation of worldviews has extremely important significance for preventing and combating revisionism. From the day the Liuhe "May 7th" Cadres School was established, it has taken the transformation of the students' worldviews as the most important task.

    To transform the worldview, one must grasp the key points. The core of the bourgeois worldview is the character "self." For cadres, the character "self" is most prominent and concentrated in the character "official." Some cadres in the past were driven by the character "self," pursuing the character "official," and evolved into the character "revisionist." The character "official" is the key. To solve the problem of cadres' worldviews, one must thoroughly eliminate the character "official."

    The "May 7th" Cadres School is located on the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements. Its conditions and environment are very favorable for solving the problem of cadres' worldviews and eliminating the character "official." The students came from big cities to the mountains, from high-rise buildings to thatched huts, from being officials to serving the people. All these changes could not help but touch the souls of each person, causing a great shock to their worldviews. The students said: "Once in the 'May 7th' Cadres School, no matter how high an official you were, as soon as you pick up a sickle or a hoe, half of your official airs are gone." The problem is not just about eliminating official airs; more importantly, it is about eliminating the mentality of being an official and a lord.

    In the past, many cadres had great blindness in transforming their worldviews. To overcome this blindness and increase self-awareness, we organized study classes and guided the students to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, dissect their own worldviews, and at the same time, constantly guide everyone to find problems from the perspective of the struggle over lines and find the causes in their worldviews. Some cadres, before the Cultural Revolution, were full of official airs. During the Cultural Revolution, they were criticized and turned their official airs into resentment. After the revolutionary criticism, their "theories" were exhausted, and they turned their resentment into discouragement, lying down and not doing anything. After coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School, they increased their self-awareness of transforming their worldviews, found the causes of their mistakes in their worldviews, and turned their resentment and discouragement into the courage to correct mistakes and the revolutionary spirit to continue the revolution.

    Some young rebels thought that since their family backgrounds were good and they were rebels during the Cultural Revolution, they had no major problems with their worldviews. They only saw themselves as the driving force of the revolution and did not see themselves as the object of the revolution. After coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School, they realized that there were also bad thoughts of wanting to be an official deep in their souls, thereby increasing their self-awareness of transforming their worldviews.

    To help the students better transform their worldviews, we put them in the forefront of the storm, to be tested and tempered, to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. They went on expeditions to open up wasteland, built dams across rivers, lived in huts, ate wild vegetables, climbed mountains, crossed marshes, and did things that others thought they couldn't do, and they did them well. In the hard labor and life, many things require you to make quick choices, either to charge forward or to retreat. Charging forward means the character "public" wins; retreating means the character "self" prevails. This is the "200-meter stretch" where the characters "public" and "self" clash, the place where two worldviews engage in close combat. Because the students had a strong desire to transform their worldviews, the effect of ideological revolutionization was immediate.

    A middle-level cadre from the original Provincial Committee Propaganda Department had long been detached from production labor, comfortably doing "revolution," and turned the word "revolution" into the word "official," walking far down the revisionist path. After coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School, he decided to eliminate the mentality of being an official and a lord. Once, when he had to paint a large oil tank, there was marsh gas inside, and entering it could cause asphyxiation at any time. Facing this severe test, he loudly recited: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Despite the danger to his life, he resolutely jumped in and finally painted the oil tank. This incident made him unable to calm down for a long time. He said: The "May 7th" Cadres School is a high-temperature, high-speed furnace. As long as one consciously transforms oneself, one can completely break with the concept of being an official and quickly achieve ideological revolutionization.

    In the past five months, the students of the "May 7th" Cadres School have waged an uncompromising struggle against the bourgeois worldview, purged the mentality of being an official and a lord, and their spiritual faces have undergone profound changes. Poor and lower-middle peasants meaningfully said: "With cadres like you, we are at ease!"

    Combining with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers is the Fundamental Path for Running the School

    Chairman Mao taught us: "We must definitely shift our standpoint, definitely in the process of deeply entering the workers, peasants, and soldiers, deeply entering the actual struggle, in the process of learning Marxism and learning society, gradually shift, shift to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, shift to the side of the proletariat." The Liuhe "May 7th" Cadres School is located on the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements and has come to the workers and peasants. The students were mixed with more than a hundred workers and poor and lower-middle peasants from the original farm, creating extremely favorable conditions for combining with the workers and peasants. However, for a period of time, some comrades, although physically among the workers and peasants, could not combine their thoughts and feelings with the workers and peasants. These comrades had good family backgrounds, came from the workers and peasants, had once shared joys and sorrows with the laboring people, but later, due to long-term detachment from labor and the laboring people, their thoughts and feelings gradually changed. After coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School, they completely "revealed themselves." They had different feelings from the poor and lower-middle peasants, spoke different languages, and although the masses were full of enthusiasm towards them, they were far from the masses. Some even proposed: "Is it us educating them, or them educating us?"

    This situation shows: Coming to the workers and peasants does not mean combining with them. To truly combine with the workers and peasants, one must undergo long-term and even painful tempering. The process of combining is the process of the struggle between two worldviews, the process of the proletarian worldview defeating the bourgeois worldview.

    To help the students more broadly and better accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we also adopted the method of "inviting in and going out." "Inviting in" means inviting workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and PLA soldiers and officers to the school to share their experiences in actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought and to give classes on class struggle and production struggle to the students; "going out" means organizing the students in a planned manner to conduct social investigations in industrial and mining enterprises and rural production teams and to engage in mass work. In the five months since the school was established, we have invited sixteen people to the school to re-educate the students and sent out six study teams to learn outside. We have also established close ties with the surrounding people's communes and forest farms, linked up with two production brigades as points for the students of the "May 7th" Cadres School to engage in mass work. In the process of combining with the workers and peasants, the students saw their own fatal weaknesses that they had long been unaware of. They said: "After contacting the poor and lower-middle peasants, we realized that we were covered in dust and needed to wash it off."

    A study team went to the New Great Brigade near the school to conduct a social investigation. An old poor peasant gave the students a vivid class struggle lesson between the two lines. This old poor peasant, during the Cultural Revolution, bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and rebelled against a small handful of capitalist roaders. When the class enemies attacked and framed him, he remained unshaken and firmly said: "With Chairman Mao supporting us poor and lower-middle peasants, we fear nothing!" In those days of hard struggle, he studied Chairman Mao's works every day, listened to the radio every day, listened to Chairman Mao's voice, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, united with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and finally won the victory in the struggle against the enemy. Many comrades thought of their own painful lessons of making mistakes during the Cultural Revolution and deeply felt that their class feelings for Chairman Mao were not as deep as those of the poor and lower-middle peasants, their class stand was not as firm as that of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and their awareness of the struggle between the two lines was not as high as that of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Everyone said: "The poor and lower-middle peasants are our best teachers. We must honestly accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

    The students sweated with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, their hearts connected, and their standpoint began to shift to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their thoughts and feelings began to blend with the workers and peasants. A leader who had participated in the revolution for more than twenty years, but had long lived in high-rise buildings and worked in offices, seriously detached from the workers and peasants, said: "I had never been an ordinary laborer for a day, had never done grassroots work for a day." After coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School, in the process of combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, his thoughts and feelings underwent great changes. Once, he threshed for a production team very carefully, picking up every grain of rice that fell to the ground. The community members were deeply moved by this.

    Chairman Mao taught: "Our Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." Five months of revolutionary practice, the students' faces were tanned, their hands and feet were covered with mud, but their hearts were redder, and their souls were purer. They became close to the workers and peasants, and the workers and peasants also became close to them. Becoming close to the workers and peasants means following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line closely, thinking big, thinking about the revolution. The students generally felt: Coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School was like re-enlisting, enlisting in the ranks of workers, peasants, and soldiers, enlisting in the ranks of continuing the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. An old cadre, during the Anti-Japanese War, once, during a major sweep by the Japanese invaders, an old peasant woman risked her life to protect him in front of the enemy, but after he went to the city, he developed official airs and became estranged from the workers and peasants, even forgetting the old peasant woman who had saved him. After coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School, he became a swineherd, living with the poor and lower-middle peasants, which made him think of that old woman again. He said painfully: "In the past, I did not forget just one old peasant woman, but I forgot a class, forgot the suffering people of the world." He had never written poetry before, but when he thought of that old woman and the suffering people of the world, he wrote lines full of revolutionary passion in his labor place: "In the pigsty and sheep pen, we make revolution, in the five continents and four seas, we see a red world."

    Now, the students' spiritual realm has reached a new height. Everyone proudly says: Stand high, stand at the height of the times; look far, look at the future of communism; do big things, do a great cause of liberating all mankind thoroughly.

    灵魂深处的一场大革命
    ——创办柳河“五·七”干校的基本体会
    黑龙江省柳河“五·七”干校革命委员会
    今年五月七日，在我们伟大领袖毛主席“五·七”指示发表两周年的光辉日子里，黑龙江省革命委员会组织了一批原省直属机关的干部下放劳动，在庆安县柳河的一个机关农场，创办了一所“五·七”干校。
    毛主席最近教导我们，“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”经过五个月的革命实践，我们深深体会到：毛主席的教导无比英明，无比正确。毛主席这一光辉指示，将永远照耀我们的前进道路。
    光辉的“五·七”指示是办校的根本方针
    在筹办“五·七”干校的时候，省革命委员会就明确指出：“五·七”干校要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席的光辉“五·七”指示为指针，以抗大为榜样，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动第一线，活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观，培养造就一批永远忠于毛主席，能上能下，能“官”能民，亦工亦农，亦文亦武的共产主义新人。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”“五·七”干校从它诞生的那一天起，就围绕着坚持什么方向，办什么样的干校的问题，展开了尖锐的两条路线的斗争。建校初，当学员们按照毛主席的“五·七”指示，怀着豪情壮志，远征开荒，开始紧张的春耕生产的时候，有人提出：“干校，干校，顾名思义，要象个学校的样子，要开几门课，要系统学。”这种论调，就是要扭转“五·七”干校的大方向。我们立即抓住这个问题，展开了一场全校性的大辩论，大张旗鼓地进行了“三个教育，一个批判”。三个教育就是：毛主席的“五·七”指示教育，抗大传统教育，阶级教育。一个批判就是：彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义的干部教育路线。
    经过这场大辩论，捍卫了毛主席的“五·七”指示，端正了办校的方向。学员们指出：要开几门课，系统地学的主张，实质上就是要恢复旧党校“三脱离”（脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离生产劳动）搞闭门修养那一套，我们绝不能这样做。我们要按照毛主席的“五·七”指示，办一所崭新的、革命化的干校。
    毛主席的“五·七”指示变成了巨大的物质力量。学员们学政治、学军事、学文化，从事群众工作，批判资产阶级。白手起家，艰苦创业，以农为主，办工业，办林业，办牧业，办副业。整个干校出现了朝气勃勃、欣欣向荣的新局面。
    在同大自然进行战斗中，学员们把自己的每一个行动，都和落实毛主席的“五·七”指示联系起来，哪里艰苦就向哪里冲。他们脚上打起了血泡，手上磨起了厚茧，大家深切地感到：这就是最好的学习，这就是革命。
    但是，斗争并没有结束。过了一段，又出现了另一种主张。有人说：“干校，干校，就是干活的学校。学好农活，当个劳力，就行了。”这种人，埋头劳动，死钻技术，劳动往前跑，开会往后坐，放松了思想改造。说什么“上有革委会，下有造反派，主意你们出，队伍你们带，我只干点活，清闲又自在。”
    我们认为：这种主张是要把“五·七”干校，当成阶级斗争的“避风港”，是从另一个方面来扭转“五·七”干校的大方向。针对这种情况，我们又组织了一场全校性的大辩论。当时正是麦收大忙季节，不少人坐不住了，他们忙着磨刀，焦急地对革委会的同志说：“麦收催人，还是快去割麦子吧！”我们认为，磨刀先要磨思想。我们下了狠心，集中四天时间，就“五·七”干校向何处去的问题，深入地开展大辩论。学员们坚定地说：“我们绝不能把干校办成只顾生产，利润挂帅的旧农场。”“我们上的不仅是劳动课，更重要的是落实毛主席‘五·七’指示的课。我们过的不仅是劳动关，更重要的是过社会主义革命这一关。”经过这场大辩论，进一步端正了“五·七”干校的大方向，“五·七”干校沿着毛主席“五·七”指示指引的道路大踏步地前进了。
    “五·七”干校是“炼人”的。在干校，一切活动，都是围绕着改造世界观这个问题转的。学员的生产劳动、学习、军训、日常生活，都和落实毛主席的“五·七”指示，锤炼无限忠于毛主席的红心，紧紧地联结起来。战地整风、地头讲用会、颂扬会、战评会、批判会，已成为“五·七”干校学员们自觉的制度。学员们学习毛主席著作的空气更浓了，对毛主席的无产阶级感情更深了，改造世界观的愿望更强烈了。学员们都说：有毛主席的“五·七”指示给我们领航，我们就能够在荒山僻野中，踏出一条反修、防修的大道来！
    改造世界观是办校的根本任务
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。无产阶级专政条件下继续革命，从根本上说，是解决人们的世界观问题。世界观的改造，对反修防修有十分重大的意义。柳河“五·七”干校从创办的那一天起，就把改造学员的世界观，作为头等重要的任务。
    改造世界观，一定要把住要害。资产阶级世界观的核心是个“私”字。对干部来说，“私”字最突出、最集中地表现在一个“官”字上。有些干部过去就是由一个“私”字，追求一个“官”字，演变成一个“修”字。“官”字就是要害。要解决干部的世界观问题，就是要狠狠地打掉这个“官”字。
    “五·七”干校办在三大革命运动的第一线，它的条件和环境，对解决干部的世界观问题，对打掉“官”字，极为有利。学员们从大城市来到山沟里，从大楼搬到茅草房，从当“官”到为民，这一切变化，都不能不触及每个人的灵魂，引起世界观的大震动。学员们说：“到了‘五·七’干校，不管你‘官’有多高，镰刀、锄头一拿，官架子就打掉一大半了。”问题还不仅在于要打掉官架子，更重要的是要铲除当官作老爷的思想。
    过去，不少干部在世界观的改造上，存在着很大的盲目性。为了克服盲目性，增强自觉性，我们通过举办学习班，组织学员活学活用毛泽东思想，解剖自己的世界观，同时，随时随地引导大家从路线斗争上找问题，在世界观上找原因。有些干部，文化大革命前官气十足，文化大革命中挨了批判，把官气变成了怨气，经过革命大批判，他们的“理论”输光了，又把怨气变成了泄气，躺下不干了。到了“五·七”干校以后，提高了改造世界观的自觉性，从世界观上找到了犯错误的原因，他们才变怨气、泄气为改正错误的勇气和继续革命的朝气。
    有些年轻的造反派认为，自己家庭出身好，在文化大革命中又是造反派，世界观没有多大问题了。只把自己当作革命的动力，没有同时把自己当作革命的对象。到了“五·七”干校以后，他们才察觉到自己灵魂深处也有想当官的坏思想，从而增强了改造世界观的自觉性。
    为了让学员们更好地改造自己的世界观，我们把他们放在风口浪头上，去经受考验和磨炼，去活学活用毛泽东思想。远征开荒，拦河筑坝，住窝棚，吃野菜，爬大山，过沼泽，别人认为干不了的事情，他们干，还要干好。在艰苦的劳动生活中，有许多事情要求你迅速地作出抉择，或者是冲上去，或者是退下来。冲上去，“公”字就胜利了；退下来，“私”字就得逞了。这里是“公”字和“私”字交锋的“二百米地段”，是两种世界观打“白刃战”的地方。由于学员们有着改造世界观的强烈愿望，思想革命化收到了立竿见影的效果。
    原省委宣传部一位中层领导干部，长期脱离生产劳动，舒舒服服地干“革命”，结果把“革命”二字变成了“当官”二字，在修正主义道路上走得很远。到“五·七”干校以后，他下决心铲除当官作老爷的思想。有一次要刷大油罐，罐里有沼气，进去随时都有窒息的可能。在这严峻的考验面前，他高声朗诵着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”冒着生命危险，毅然决然地跳了进去，终于把油罐刷好了。这件事使他久久不能平静，他说：“五·七”干校是一座高温高速的大熔炉，只要自觉地改造自己，就可以和当官的观念彻底决裂，迅速实现思想革命化。
    五个月来，“五·七”干校的学员同资产阶级世界观进行了无情的斗争，荡涤了当官作老爷的思想，精神面貌起了深刻的变化。贫下中农意味深长地说：“有了你们这样的干部，我们就放心了！”
    同工农兵相结合是办校的根本途径
    毛主席教导我们：“一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。”柳河“五·七”干校办在三大革命运动第一线，走到工农群众当中来了。学员同原来农场的一百多名工人和贫下中农混合编队，为同工农群众相结合，创造了极为有利的条件。但是，有一段时间，有些同志虽然身在工农群众中，思想感情上却和工农群众结合不起来。这些同志，有的家庭出身很好，来自工农群众之中，曾和劳动人民同甘苦，共患难，后来由于长期脱离劳动，脱离劳动人民，思想感情渐渐地变了。到了“五·七”干校以后，彻底地“亮相”了。他们和贫下中农感情不一，语言不同，群众对他们满腔热情，他们却与群众离得很远。还有些同志，他们接受的是旧学校的教育，自以为了不起，轻视工农群众。到了“五·七”干校以后，架子老大，思想感情与贫下中农格格不入。有的竟然提出：“是我们教育他们呢？还是他们教育我们呢？”
    这种情况说明：到工农群众中来，并不等于就同工农结合了。要真正做到同工农相结合，必须经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨炼。结合的过程，就是两种世界观斗争的过程，就是无产阶级世界观战胜资产阶级世界观的过程。
    为了使学员更广泛、更好地接受工农兵的再教育，我们还采取“请进来，走出去”的办法。“请进来”，就是请外面的工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员到干校传授活学活用毛泽东思想的经验，给学员上阶级斗争、生产斗争课；“走出去”，就是有计划地组织学员，到工矿企业、农村生产队进行社会调查，从事群众工作。干校创办五个月来，我们先后请进十六人到校给学员以再教育，派出六个学习队到外地学习。我们还同周围的人民公社和林场建立了密切的联系，跟两个生产大队挂了钩，作为干校学员从事群众工作的点。学员们在同工农群众结合的过程中，看到了过去自己长期觉察不到的致命弱点。他们说：“接触了贫下中农，才发觉自己一身灰，不洗不行了。”
    有一个学习队，到干校附近的新山大队进行社会调查。一位老贫农给学员们上了一堂生动的两条路线斗争教育课。这位老贫农在文化大革命中，英勇地捍卫毛主席的革命路线，造了一小撮走资派的反。当阶级敌人对他进行打击陷害时，他毫不动摇，坚定地说：“有毛主席给我们贫下中农撑腰，我们什么也不怕！”在那艰苦斗争的日子里，他天天学习毛主席著作，天天听广播，倾听毛主席的声音，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，和广大贫下中农团结在一起，终于取得了对敌斗争的胜利。许多同志联想到自己在文化大革命中犯错误的沉痛教训，深切地感到，我们对毛主席的阶级感情不如贫下中农深，阶级立场不如贫下中农坚定，两条路线斗争觉悟不如贫下中农高。大家说：“贫下中农是我们最好的老师，我们就是要老老实实地接受贫下中农的再教育。”
    学员们和广大贫下中农汗流在一起，心连在一起，立足点开始移到工农兵这方面来，思想感情开始和工农群众打成一片。有一位领导干部，参加革命二十多年，但是长期住大楼，蹲机关，严重脱离工农群众，用他的话说：“没当过一天普通劳动者，没作过一天基层工作。”到了“五·七”干校以后，在同工农兵结合的过程中，思想感情发生很大变化。有一次，他给一个生产队脱谷，非常精心，把掉在地上的粮食一粒一粒地拣起来，社员们看了都很受感动。
    毛主席教导说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”五个月的革命实践，学员们脸晒黑了，手脚沾满了泥巴，但心更红了，灵魂更干净了。他们和工农群众亲了，工农群众和他们也亲了，和工农群众亲了，就是跟毛主席的革命路线跟得紧了，就想大事了，就想革命了。学员们普遍感到：到了“五·七”干校是一次重新入伍，入了工农兵的队伍，入了无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的队伍。有个老干部，抗日战争时期，有次日本侵略军大扫荡，一位贫农老大娘冒着生命危险，在敌人面前把他掩护下来，但他进城后滋长了官气，和工农群众疏远了，把救过他的贫农老大娘也忘了。到“五·七”干校后，他当了猪倌，和贫下中农生活在一起，使他又想起了那位老大娘。他痛切地说：“我过去忘掉的不是一位贫农老大娘，而是忘掉了一个阶级，忘掉了天下的受苦人。”他本来不会写诗，但是他想到这位老大娘，想到了天下的受苦人，他就在自己劳动的地方，写下了充满革命激情的诗句：“身在猪舍羊圈闹革命，志在五洲四海一片红。”
    现在，学员们的精神境界达到了一个新的高度。大家豪迈地说：站，要往高处站，站在时代的高度；看，要往远处看，看到共产主义的未来；干，就要往大的干，干一番彻底解放全人类的伟大事业。
