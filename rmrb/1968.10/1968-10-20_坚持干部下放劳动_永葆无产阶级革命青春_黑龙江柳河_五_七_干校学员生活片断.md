Cadres sent to labor in the countryside at the May Seventh Cadre School in Liuhe, Heilongjiang, maintain the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat.

"The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Every day before going to work, the May Seventh soldiers study Chairman Mao's quotations earnestly and fight under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The students of the May Seventh Cadre School visited the home of old poor peasant Guan Wenbin (second from the right). Guan Wenbin said with deep feelings, "I often think of the old cadres from the land reform period. They were closely connected with us poor and lower-middle peasants, breathing the same air. Later, the cadres went to the cities, and some of them gradually became distant from us. They looked down on us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we poor and lower-middle peasants also looked down on them. You, following Chairman Mao's teachings, went to labor in the countryside, and we have seen good cadres who are closely connected with us, just like in the land reform period!"

To better reform their worldview, the students of the May Seventh Cadre School actively went to the forefront to test and temper themselves, and to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. This is a scene of students jumping into the cold river water to build a dam across the river.

Before joining the revolution, he was a shepherd. After the revolution's victory, he lived in luxury and became detached from the masses. After coming to the May Seventh Cadre School, he picked up the shepherd's whip he had not used for decades, and his feelings ran deep.

    坚持干部下放劳动　永葆无产阶级革命青春
    ——黑龙江柳河“五·七”干校学员生活片断
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。“五·七”战士每天出工前都认真学习毛主席语录，在毛泽东思想指引下进行战斗。

    “五·七”干校学员边战斗，边学习毛泽东思想，边批判资产阶级。这是学员们在口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义干部教育路线。

    “五·七”干校的学员们到老贫农关文斌（右二）家里访问，关文斌深有感触地说：“我时常想着土改时的老干部，他们和我们贫下中农血肉相连，息息相关。后来干部进了城，有些人和我们渐渐疏远了，他们看不起我们贫下中农，我们贫下中农也看不起他们。你们按照毛主席的教导，下放劳动，我们又看到了土改时期那样和我们血肉相连的好干部！”

    为了更好地改造自己的世界观，“五·七”干校的学员们主动地到风口浪头上去经受考验和磨炼，去活学活用毛泽东思想。这是在拦河筑坝时，学员们跳进冰冷的河水，艰苦奋战。　　新华社稿
    “五·七”干校学员温溶洗（左）在草原上向年轻的放羊娃讲述他自己的思想体会。温溶洗是一个抗日时期的老干部，参加革命前是放羊娃，革命胜利后，养尊处优，脱离群众。到“五·七”干校后，他重新拿起几十年前的放羊鞭子，感慨尤深。
