Under the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the Chinese working class has carried forward the self-reliant revolutionary spirit and created brilliant achievements. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Railway Bridge has been successfully completed and opened to traffic.

More than 50,000 military personnel and civilians in Nanjing held a grand opening ceremony on September 30. The shouts of "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" echoed through the sky.

The completion of this, the largest modern bridge designed and constructed by China, is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, another brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great creation of the Chinese working class, and a great feat in the history of world bridge construction. Its completion and opening to traffic further strengthen the transportation links between North and South China, and have significant political, economic, and strategic importance.

New China News Agency, Nanjing, October 3: Under the brilliant light of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese working class, carrying forward the self-reliant spirit of the proletarian revolution, has designed, constructed, and built the largest modern bridge in China—the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Railway Bridge. The bridge has been successfully completed and officially opened to traffic on October 1. The new Nanjing Railway Station was also completed at the same time.

The completion and opening to traffic of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Railway Bridge further strengthen the transportation links between North and South China, and have significant political, economic, and strategic importance. This brilliant achievement of the Chinese working class is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! It is a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought that echoes through the sky! It is another brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have shown great concern for the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. On May 8 this year, Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin received the workers who participated in the National Railway and Transportation Conference, giving the bridge builders immense encouragement and boundless strength. Under the inspiration of this great news, the bridge builders, with a magnificent and heroic spirit, advanced the completion time of the railway bridge by three months. At the critical moment of the bridge's construction, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin issued timely and wise instructions and sent People's Liberation Army soldiers to fight side by side with the workers, ensuring the smooth progress of the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

The construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a great creation of the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and a great feat in the history of world bridge construction. The bridge is a dual-track, double-deck bridge for both railway and highway use, with a total length of more than 6,700 meters, four times the length of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. People walking from the approach bridge to the end of the bridge need more than an hour. The massive steel beams of the bridge soar across nine piers standing in the river. Currently, the railway bridge has been fully completed, and the highway bridge is under construction. On the bridgeheads at both ends of the bridge, three red flags are proudly flying, and on both sides of the main bridge's steel beams, ten bright red characters "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" are hanging, expressing the Chinese working class's boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Chinese people have the spirit and the ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." The construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge fully demonstrates the revolutionary heroism of the Chinese working class under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, daring to scale new heights and forge new paths. Nanjing is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, where the river is wide, the water is deep and swift, and the underwater geological conditions are extremely complex. It is also frequently affected by strong typhoons and tides from the coast. Before liberation, Japanese imperialism and American imperialism, in order to expedite the plunder of the Chinese people, had attempted to build a bridge here. However, facing the complex geological and hydrological conditions, they could only declare that building a bridge in Nanjing was more difficult than scaling the heavens. After liberation, the Chinese working class, standing up, followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "self-reliance," with the revolutionary spirit of "daring to change the heavens and the earth," built the third Yangtze River Bridge in Nanjing after successfully completing the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the Chongqing Baishaqiao Yangtze River Bridge. The bridge builders, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, set their hearts on high and their ambitions on great, without using a single foreigner or a single piece of foreign equipment, designed, constructed, and installed the bridge themselves, opening a new era of self-reliant construction of large bridges in China.

The construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was carried out in the midst of fierce struggles between two classes, two lines, and two roads. During the construction process, Liu Shaoqi and his agents, crazed with the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, blindly believed in foreign frameworks and old dogmas, promoted the "expert line," advocated "technology first," and allowed bourgeois technical "authorities" to control the technical leadership of the bridge construction. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the bridge builders had fought resolutely against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. After the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the bridge builders, together with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary engineering and technical personnel, with the help of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and after repeated struggles and fierce battles, thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by a handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities," thoroughly smashed the evil plots of a handful of class enemies to sabotage the bridge construction, ensured that the leadership of the bridge revolution and production was firmly in the hands of the working class, guaranteed the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and ensured the smooth progress of the bridge construction, and completed the railway bridge ahead of schedule.

The People's Liberation Army units stationed in Nanjing for supporting the left, supporting the workers, and protecting the bridge have made outstanding contributions to the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

During the construction process, workers from all over the country, with the spirit of striving for Chairman Mao and adding glory to the motherland, carried forward the high sense of responsibility of the masters, and made great contributions to the early completion of the bridge. Workers from Anshan Steel Plant successfully developed high-strength, high-quality bridge steel for the bridge construction, smashing the sabotage and obstruction of the Soviet revisionists. Workers from the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory worked day and night to produce steel beams to ensure the early completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. Workers from chemical plants in Tianjin, Liaoning, and other places developed a new type of steel beam paint for the Nanjing Bridge, which can last more than twelve years with one application. Workers from Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jiangsu have all contributed their strength to the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

New China News Agency, Nanjing, October 3: In the joyous celebration of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Railway Bridge officially opened to traffic at midnight on October 1. On September 30, more than 50,000 military personnel and civilians in Nanjing held a grand opening ceremony.

On September 30, the vast Yangtze River in Nanjing was filled with ships flying colorful flags. The bridge above and below was adorned with countless red flags. On the towering bridgeheads, three giant red flags made of glass sparkled in the bright sunlight, and the majestic Yangtze River Bridge was more magnificent than ever. Early in the morning, the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary masses participating in the opening ceremony, as well as the People's Liberation Army soldiers who had made outstanding contributions in supporting the left, supporting the workers, and protecting the bridge, gathered from all directions to the riverbank and the bridgehead, waiting for the exciting moment when the railway bridge would officially open to traffic.

The commander of the Nanjing Military Region and the chairman of the Jiangsu Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Xu Shiyou, other leaders of the Jiangsu Revolutionary Committee and the Nanjing Military Region, and leaders of the Nanjing Revolutionary Committee attended the opening ceremony.

At 2 PM, the opening ceremony began with the music "Congratulations on Chairman Mao's Long Life."

Comrade Yang Guangli, vice chairman of the Jiangsu Revolutionary Committee, first spoke at the meeting. After introducing the process of the bridge builders following Chairman Mao's teaching of "self-reliance" and building the bridge in the midst of fierce struggles between two classes, two lines, and two roads, he said that the brilliant achievements of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge construction once again prove that as long as Mao Zedong Thought is in command in all work, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is firmly implemented, and the leading role of the working class is fully played, there is nothing that cannot be achieved, and no enemy that cannot be defeated. Miracles can be created.

Comrade Yang Jie, a responsible person from the Ministry of Railways, on behalf of the Ministry of Railways and all revolutionary staff of the national railways, extended warm congratulations to all workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary engineering and technical personnel who participated in the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

The meeting, amid thunderous applause, passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

After Comrade Xu Shiyou cut the ribbon for the railway bridge, a train adorned with festive decorations and carrying workers, peasants, and soldiers from Nanjing, as well as Red Guards, slowly passed through the bridge. At this moment, both sides of the river were in a festive atmosphere, and shouts of "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" and "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" echoed through the sky.

At 3 AM on October 1, when the great People's Republic of China entered its 20th year, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Railway Bridge passed the first passenger train heading to the capital—Train No. 46 from Fuzhou to Beijing. When the train drove onto the brightly lit railway bridge, the carriage was filled with excitement. Workers from Shanghai, the birthplace of the "January Revolution" storm, soldiers from the coastal defense front in Fujian, and revolutionary masses from all over the country were all happy and proud to be on the first passenger train passing through the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Railway Bridge. They sang "The Ship of the Sea Rely on the Helmsman" and rushed to the windows to admire the majestic steel arch. After the train passed the bridge, the passengers' excitement lasted for a long time. They sat closely together, discussing the great situation on all fronts, and cheering for the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

    在伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲切关怀下  我国工人阶级发扬自力更生的革命精神创造了辉煌成就
    南京长江大桥铁路桥胜利建成通车
    南京市五万多军民九月三十日隆重举行通车典礼，“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声响彻云霄
    这座我国自行设计和施工建造的最大的现代化桥梁的建成，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一光辉成果，是我国工人阶级的伟大创造，是世界桥梁史上的一个伟大创举。它的建成和通车进一步加强了我国南北的交通联系，具有重大的政治、经济和战略意义
    新华社南京三日电　在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照耀下，我国工人阶级发扬自力更生的无产阶级革命精神，自行设计、自行施工建造的最大的现代化桥梁——南京长江大桥的铁路桥，已经胜利建成，并且在十月一日正式通车。南京新车站也同时宣告落成。
    南京长江大桥铁路桥的建成和通车，进一步加强了我国南北的交通联系，具有重大的政治、经济和战略意义。我国工人阶级创造的这一辉煌成就，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！是毛泽东思想的一曲响彻云霄的凯歌！是无产阶级文化大革命的又一光辉成果！
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，十分关怀南京长江大桥的建设。今年五月八日，毛主席和林副主席接见了参加全国铁路、交通会议的南京长江大桥工人代表，给了建桥工人巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。在特大喜讯的鼓舞下，建桥工人以气壮山河的豪迈气概，把铁路桥的建成时间提前了三个月。在大桥建设的关键时刻，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部及时发出英明指示，并且派来人民解放军指战员，同工人群众并肩战斗，保证了南京长江大桥的顺利施工。
    南京长江大桥的建设，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国工人阶级的伟大创造，是世界桥梁史上的一个伟大创举。大桥是双线、双层的铁路和公路两用桥，全长六千七百多米，长度为武汉长江大桥的四倍，人们从大桥的引桥开始步行过桥，要走一个多小时。大桥凌空飞架的巨大钢梁，横卧在九个矗立江心的桥墩上。目前，铁路桥已经全部竣工，公路桥正在加紧施工。在大桥两端巍然屹立的桥头堡上，高耸着光彩夺目的三面红旗，正桥钢梁两侧，高悬着“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁”十个红光闪闪的大字，表达了我国工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱、无限忠诚。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”南京长江大桥的建设，充分显示了在毛泽东思想指引下的我国工人阶级敢于攀险峰、闯新路的革命英雄气概。南京地处长江下游，这里江面宽阔，水深浪急，水下地质情况极为复杂，这里还经常受到沿海强大台风和海潮的侵袭。解放前，日本帝国主义和美帝国主义为了加紧对中国人民进行掠夺，都曾想在这里修桥。但是，他们面对这里的复杂的地质和水文情况，只能断言说，在南京修桥，比登天还难。解放以后，站起来了的中国工人阶级，遵照毛主席“自力更生”的伟大教导，用“敢教日月换新天”的革命气概，在胜利建成武汉长江大桥、重庆白沙沱长江大桥之后，决心在帝国主义预言家断言不能修桥的南京，建设第三座长江大桥。建桥工人用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装头脑，树雄心，立壮志，没用一个洋人，没用一件洋设备，自己设计、自己施工、自行安装，进行了南京长江大桥的建设，开创了我国自力更生修建大型桥梁的新纪元。
    南京长江大桥的建设，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中进行的。建桥过程中，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线。他们迷信洋框框，旧教条，推行“专家路线”，鼓吹“技术第一”，让资产阶级技术“权威”控制建设大桥的技术领导大权。无产阶级文化大革命前，建桥工人就同反革命修正主义路线进行了坚决的斗争。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，建桥工人充分发挥领导阶级的伟大作用，同革命干部和革命的工程技术人员一道，在人民解放军指战员的帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，经过反复较量和激烈搏斗，彻底粉碎了一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”推行的反革命修正主义路线，彻底粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏大桥建设的罪恶阴谋，使大桥革命和生产的领导权牢牢地掌握在工人阶级手里，保证了毛主席革命路线的贯彻执行，保证了大桥建设的顺利进行，并且提前建成了铁路桥。
    人民解放军驻南京长江大桥的支左、支工和护桥部队，为南京长江大桥的建设立下了卓越的新功。
    在大桥建设过程中，全国各地的工人阶级怀着为毛主席争气、为祖国增光的雄心壮志，发扬主人翁的高度责任感，为早日建成这座大桥作出了巨大的贡献。鞍钢工人为大桥建设试制成功了高强度优质桥梁钢，粉碎了苏修的刁难和破坏。山海关桥梁厂的工人为了保证南京长江大桥的早日建成，夜以继日地赶制钢梁，及时满足了需要。天津、辽宁等地一些化工厂的工人为南京大桥试制成功了一种新型的钢梁面漆，油漆一次可以保用十二年以上。北京、上海、武汉以及江苏等地的工人阶级，都为建设南京长江大桥贡献了自己的力量。
    新华社南京三日电　在欢庆伟大的中华人民共和国成立十九周年的光辉节日里，南京长江大桥铁路桥于十月一日零时起正式通车。九月三十日，南京市五万多军民隆重地举行了通车典礼。
    九月三十日，南京辽阔的长江江面，来往不绝的船只飘扬着彩旗。大桥上下，无数面红旗迎风招展。在高耸入云的桥头堡上，用玻璃镶嵌而成的三面巨幅红旗在灿烂的阳光下闪闪发光，气势雄伟的长江大桥显得分外壮观。一早，参加通车典礼的广大工人、贫下中农和革命群众，以及在大桥支左、支工和护桥等工作中立下卓越新功的解放军指战员，满怀着胜利的喜悦，敲锣打鼓，喜气洋洋，从四面八方汇集到江边、桥头，等待着大桥铁路桥正式通车这一激动人心的时刻的到来。
    中国人民解放军南京部队司令员、江苏省革命委员会主任许世友同志，江苏省革命委员会和南京部队的其他负责同志，南京市革命委员会的负责同志，参加了通车典礼。
    下午二时整，通车典礼在《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》的乐曲声中开始。
    江苏省革命委员会副主任杨广立同志首先在会上讲话。他介绍了建桥工人遵照毛主席“自力更生”的教导，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中建设大桥的过程以后说，南京长江大桥建设的辉煌成就，再一次证明，只要在一切工作中坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，就无往而不胜，无攻而不克，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
    铁道部负责人杨杰同志代表铁道部和全国铁路广大革命职工，向参加建设南京长江大桥的全体工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命的工程技术人员表示热烈祝贺。
    大会在暴风雨般的掌声中，通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    许世友同志为大桥铁路桥剪彩后，一列披着盛装，满载南京市工农兵群众和红卫兵小将的彩车，徐徐通过大桥。这时，大江南北，列车内外一片欢腾，“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声，响彻云霄。
    十月一日凌晨三点钟，当伟大的中华人民共和国刚进入第二十个年头的时候，南京长江大桥铁路桥通过了驶向祖国首都的第一列客车——从福州开往北京的四十六次快车。当列车驶上被无数彩灯照得通明的大桥铁路桥时，车厢内一片欢腾。来自“一月革命”风暴发源地上海的产业工人，来自福建前线的海防战士和来自祖国四面八方的革命群众，都为自己能乘坐通过南京长江大桥铁路桥的第一列客车而感到幸福和自豪。他们高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，争先恐后地挤到窗口观看钢铁长虹的雄姿。列车通过了大桥，旅客们激动的心情久久不能平静。他们紧紧地围坐在一起，畅谈各条战线的大好形势，欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
