Title: In Front of the Ten-Ton Lathe

In front of our bountiful achievement—the ten-ton lathe, we held a criticism meeting, fiercely criticizing the revisionist trash of China's Khrushchev, and fought a solid and brilliant battle.

A handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois "technical authorities" were brought up. The lathe test run began. We saw the lathe, designed and manufactured by ourselves, pulling out workpieces that were smooth and shiny. We were so excited that we repeatedly raised our arms and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "The working class must lead everything!"

Everyone was enthusiastic, saying: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and intellectuals themselves. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they will not evade problems but will solve them with an active attitude. Any difficulty in the world can be overcome.' However, a handful of capitalist roaders do not look up to the workers at all; they only respect the bourgeois 'technical authorities.' A chief engineer, along with two rightists, worked on the lathe for more than two years, but accomplished nothing. They wasted more than 8,000 yuan, and the result was a pile of scrap iron. Now that we workers are in charge, we fought for twenty days and manufactured this ten-ton lathe. Let these guys say, how is the surface finish of this lathe?"

After carefully examining it, a few of them had to admit that the surface finish reached an advanced level.

The workers stood tall and full of fighting spirit, criticizing fiercely: "China's Khrushchev falsely claims that 'capitalists know more than we do, more than the workers.' This is a malicious slander against the working class. Our factory's capitalist roaders and reactionary 'technical authorities' completely follow China's Khrushchev's tune. They boast about their superior technology, saying things like 'one thread cut with eight strokes, each stroke produces iron filings,' and falsely claim that workers are 'like rats giving birth to mice, each generation worse than the last.' This is absolutely outrageous! Now let's compare, who is truly superior? Chairman Mao points out: 'The most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience.' We workers must charge forward in practice and always be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. China's Khrushchev and his agents dare to slander the working class; we will definitely make them suffer a crushing defeat!"

In front of the brand-new ten-ton lathe, under the powerful criticism of the workers, the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev were indeed criticized to the point of being utterly shattered and smashed to pieces.

    在十吨拉床前面
    机加工车间三工段　孟广开
    我们在自己丰硕的战果——十吨拉床前面，开了个批判会，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，打了个扎扎实实的漂亮仗。
    一小撮走资派、资产阶级技术“权威”被带上来了，拉床试车开始了。我们看到自己设计、自己制造的拉床，拉出来的活又光又亮，兴奋得不断地振臂高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“工人阶级必须领导一切”！
    大家情绪激昂地说：“毛主席教导我们：‘社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。’可是一小撮走资派根本不把工人放在眼里，只看得起资产阶级技术‘权威’。一个总工程师拉了两个右派分子搞拉床，两年多的时间，什么也没搞出来。白白浪费八千多元，结果都成了一堆废铁。现在我们工人当家作主，奋战二十天，就制成了这部十吨拉床。让这些家伙自己说，这部拉床出的活，光洁度怎么样！”
    几个家伙仔细看了之后，不得不承认光洁度达到先进水平。
    工人们腰杆笔挺，斗志昂扬，狠狠批判道：“中国赫鲁晓夫胡说‘资本家知识比我们多，比工人知道的多’，这是对工人阶级的恶毒诬蔑。咱厂的走资派、反动技术‘权威’完全跟中国赫鲁晓夫唱一个调子，他们吹嘘自己技术高超，什么‘一丝切八刀，刀刀下铁屑’，胡说工人是‘黄鼠狼下耗子，一窝不如一窝’，真是岂有此理！现在比一比，到底谁高超？毛主席指出：‘最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。’咱工人就是要在实践中冲锋陷阵，永远做毛主席的好战士。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人胆敢诬蔑工人阶级，一定叫他们碰得头破血流！”
    在崭新的十吨拉床前面，在工人大批判的强大威力面前，中国赫鲁晓夫的一套反革命修正主义谬论，确实被批得体无完肤，砸得稀烂了。
