The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish!

Three Great Revolutions Show Heroism

During a meeting, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Quyu Brigade, Quxian Commune, Heshui County, Shanxi Province, excitedly said: Chairman Mao's works shine with golden light, people change their thoughts and the earth changes its appearance. Revolutionary farming produces good seeds, and hybrid sorghum is the best.

Quyu Brigade is located at the foot of the Luliang Mountains and by the Yellow River. Before liberation, it was a mountain village where harvests failed nine out of ten years. After liberation, production developed. In recent years, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taken class struggle as the key link, vigorously grasped the mass movements of production struggle and scientific experiment, and resolved to scale the heights of science and technology. They implemented the combination of old farmers, young people, and scientific and technological workers, and focused on the seed revolution. From 1966 to 1967, they introduced the hybrid sorghum variety No. 10. They summoned great efforts, overcame natural disasters such as spring droughts and summer floods, grasped the key issues in the production of hybrid sorghum, and achieved consecutive two-year harvests of over 1,100 jin per mu on more than 100 mu of land, with an average yield. Among them, four mu of high-yield fields had an average yield of 1,602 jin per mu. Now, the people of Quyu Brigade are full of spirit and fighting spirit, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and riding the strong east wind of the Cultural Revolution, they are determined to achieve an even greater harvest in 1968.

The people of Quyu Brigade have created miracles that the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie would not even dare to think of. They proudly said: Remember class struggle firmly, the three great revolutions show heroism; study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, human miracles can be created.

Let Potatoes Settle Down in Zhengzhou

After returning to the countryside, the educated youth Xie Chongxin has been participating in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. Since 1958, he has been conducting research on the promotion of the second crop of potatoes. He dared to think and act, unconstrained by the frameworks of foreigners and academic "authorities," and was determined to let potatoes settle down in Zhengzhou. Together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, he carried out extensive scientific experiments, smashed the ridicule and slander of landlords and rich peasants, and finally made potatoes settle down in Zhengzhou. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress," and based on his long-term observations in production practice, he proposed an experiment that the bourgeois "authorities" would not even dare to think of. He used a series of measures to revitalize the degenerated seed potatoes, breaking the various fallacies of the so-called "experts" that "potato degeneration is only a straight-line decline" and "potato degeneration is an 'irreversible reaction'." His experiment sufficiently proves that "the lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish."

The "Authority" on Eggplant Skins

There is a bourgeois "authority" in the Institute of Genetics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. For nineteen years after liberation, his entire "scientific research work" has been to try to make purple eggplant skins appear with white spots or white eggplant skins appear with purple spots through grafting. Therefore, he is known as the "authority" on eggplant skins. This so-called research, which neither solves production problems nor has theoretical value, was listed by the capitalist roaders as a "major basic theory and agricultural support project." From 1958 to 1966, in just eight years, more than ten assistants were assigned to him, and more than 50,000 yuan was spent. In the end, the white eggplant skin still had no purple spots, and the purple eggplant skin still had no white spots. Under his rule, there was a similar project in the laboratory, which was to try to change the color of chicken feathers by mutual blood transfusion between white chickens and black chickens. The result was the same as that of the eggplant skin.

This "authority" who claims to have "international influence" made a laughing stock of himself in the experiment. He did not know how to grow eggplants, and he was also ignorant of the technique of "grafting." Once, at the request of a young comrade, he demonstrated a graft, but this plant was so short-lived that it died in a few days. Another time, he and his most capable assistant, despite the opposition of workers and young scientific and technological personnel, insisted on moving a large number of potted eggplant seedlings weighing over a hundred jin to the sixth floor, saying it was to prevent cross-pollination. Due to the strong wind at high altitudes and the rapid evaporation of water, the lush eggplant seedlings were left with only withered branches in a few days, and the experiment yielded nothing. This is the famous joke of the "eggplant climbing the stairs" that spread throughout the institute.

    卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢
    三大革命逞英豪
    山西河曲县巡镇公社曲峪大队的贫下中农和革命干部在一次会上激动地说：毛主席著作闪金光，人换思想地换装，革命种田育好种，高粱杂种最优良。
    曲峪大队位于吕梁山下，黄河之滨，解放前是个十年九不收的山村。解放后，生产有了发展。最近几年来，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争为纲，狠抓生产斗争和科学实验的群众运动，立志攀登科学技术高峰。他们实行了老农、青年和科学技术工作者的三结合，大抓种子革命。从一九六六年到一九六七年，他们引用了遗杂十号高粱。他们鼓足干劲，战胜了春旱、夏涝等自然灾害，抓住杂交高粱的生产关键问题，连续两年获得百亩以上大面积平均亩产一千一百多斤的大丰收，其中有四亩高产田，平均亩产一千六百零二斤。现在，曲峪大队的社员们意气风发，斗志昂扬，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘文化大革命的强劲东风，誓夺一九六八年的更大丰收。
    曲峪大队的社员，创造了资产阶级反动学术“权威”想也不敢想的奇迹。他们自豪地说：阶级斗争记得牢，三大革命逞英豪；毛主席著作学用好，人间奇迹能创造。    （群英）
    让马铃薯在郑州安家落户
    回乡知识青年谢崇信在农村当社员以后，一直坚持参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动。他从一九五八年开始进行马铃薯二季作推广的研究工作以来，敢想敢干，不受洋人、学术“权威”的框框的束缚，立志要让马铃薯在郑州安家落户。他和广大贫下中农一起大搞科学实验，粉碎了地主、富农分子的嘲笑和污蔑，终于使马铃薯在郑州落户了。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他根据毛主席“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，根据他长期在生产实践中的观察，提出了一个资产阶级“权威”连想都不敢想的试验，把已经退化了的种薯采用一系列措施，使之复壮，打破了所谓“名家们”一致认为“马铃薯退化只能是直线下降”；马铃薯退化是一个“不可逆反应”的种种谬论。他的试验足以说明“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。      （学农）
    茄子皮“权威”
    中国科学院遗传研究所有一个资产阶级“权威”，解放后十九年来全部的“科研工作”，就是力图通过嫁接，使紫茄皮上出现白点或白茄皮上出现紫斑。因此被人们称为茄子皮“权威”。这项既不解决生产问题又无理论价值的所谓研究，竟被走资派列为“重大基础理论和支农项目”，仅从一九五八年到一九六六年八年期间，就为他配备了十余名助手，花费五万余元。到头来，白茄皮仍然没有紫斑，紫茄皮仍然没有白点。在他统治下的研究室，还有一个类似的项目，就是想通过白鸡与黑鸡的相互输血改变鸡毛的颜色。结果遭到了与茄子皮同样的命运。
    这个自称有“国际影响”的“权威”，在实验中笑话百出，不仅不知道如何种茄子，就是对于“嫁接”技术也一窍不通。一次应一位青年同志的请求做了一株“示范”嫁接，谁知这个植株如此命短，不几天就一命呜呼了。还有一次，他和他的最得力的助手不顾工人和青年科技人员的反对，硬将大批百余斤重的盆栽茄苗搬到六楼楼顶，说是为了防止异花授粉。由于高空风大，水分蒸发快，不几天枝叶茂密的茄苗只留下干枯的枝条，实验结果一无所获。这就是传遍全所的“茄子登楼”的笑话。          （红尖兵）
