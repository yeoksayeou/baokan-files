The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation on September 29 is as follows:

Dear Comrade Bekir Balluku,
Dear Members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation,
Comrades and Friends:

At the time when our people are celebrating the great anniversary of the 19th year of our nation's founding, the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, led by Comrade Bekir Balluku, has come to our country from the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. You have brought with you the profound proletarian revolutionary friendship of the Albanian people, led by their great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the heroic Albanian people, which is the closest friend of the Chinese people. This is another great support and encouragement for the Chinese people who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On behalf of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, I extend the warmest welcome and heartfelt thanks to you.

Under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people have adhered to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and are determined to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. In recent years, your country's vigorous revolutionary movement has achieved one brilliant victory after another. This year, Comrade Enver Hoxha's proposals for educational revolution and worker supervision have pushed this revolutionary movement to a broader and deeper stage of development. The Albanian revolutionary movement has promoted the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, driven the development of production, strengthened national defense, and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a great victory for the Albanian Labor Party in combining Marxism-Leninism with the concrete revolutionary practice of Albania. You have provided valuable experience for preventing capitalist restoration in socialist countries and have made a great contribution to the international communist movement.

The Chinese people are greatly inspired and delighted to see the brilliant light of this great socialist beacon in Europe shining ever more brightly.

The glorious Albanian Labor Party and the heroic Albanian people have always held high the banner of anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolution. At every critical moment in the struggle against American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, they have always stood at the forefront of the battle with great heroism, dealing heavy blows to the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists. Not long ago, you exposed and denounced without mercy the heinous crimes of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and its followers in armed occupation of Czechoslovakia, as well as the treacherous surrender of the Czechoslovak revisionist leadership. You firmly supported the struggle of the Czechoslovak people and the peoples of Eastern European countries against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, demonstrating the high principles of Marxism-Leninism and the noble spirit of proletarian internationalism. Recently, you dared to defy the Soviet revisionist "giant" and decisively announced your withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. This is a very courageous revolutionary act. It has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world, greatly dampened the arrogance of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and made a new and great contribution to the struggle of the peoples of Eastern Europe and all countries against American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, winning the enthusiastic praise and boundless admiration of the revolutionary people of the world.

The Warsaw Pact controlled by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has long become an aggressive, anti-socialist pact. Like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization controlled by the Americans and other treaty organizations, it is a tool for promoting neo-colonialism, a means for the Soviet revisionists to collude with American imperialism in counter-revolutionary deals, redivide the world, and carve out spheres of influence. Now, people all over the world are increasingly seeing clearly that the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists are of the same ilk. The American imperialists are waging unrestrained aggression against Vietnam, the Soviet revisionists are waging unrestrained aggression against Czechoslovakia, the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists are colluding to conspire against the Arab people. All this proves that the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionist renegade clique are the most ferocious enemies of the people of the world. The peoples of Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries of the world must bury the North Atlantic Treaty Organization controlled by the Americans and the Warsaw Pact controlled by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and other aggressive treaties, and must resolutely overthrow imperialism headed by the Americans and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist renegade clique.

After occupying Czechoslovakia, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique recently used the name of the Warsaw Pact to station troops in Bulgaria, strengthening its control and plunder of the Bulgarian people, seriously threatening the security of socialist Albania and the peoples of the Balkan countries.

The Albanian Labor Party, which holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, bravely leads and mobilizes the entire people to heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and be ready to give a crushing blow to any enemy who dares to invade. The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, said, "There has never been, and there is still no one who can intimidate the Albanian people. The people and the party who defend the borders and territory of Albania will give a crushing blow to anyone who dares to invade them." This fully embodies the heroic Albanian people's indomitable spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win.

When the Soviet social-imperialists are stepping up their aggression and threats against Eastern Europe, they are also further intensifying their armed provocations against China. They are collaborating with the American imperialists to create an anti-China encirclement, stationing large numbers of troops along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders, and frequently dispatching aircraft to violate Chinese airspace, constantly creating border tensions. Their actions do not show their strength but rather their guilt, cowardice, and timidity.

We must solemnly warn the Soviet revisionist renegade clique that the military threats and war blackmail tactics you learned from American imperialism are of no use against the Albanian people and the Chinese people who are armed with Marxism-Leninism. If you dare to defy the world and invade socialist Albania, the Albanian people will not let you off, the Chinese people will not let you off, and the revolutionary people of the world will not let you off. Waiting for you will only be a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure.

Comrades! The revolutionary friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two armies of China and Albania, forged in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, can withstand any test. This visit by the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, led by Comrade Bekir Balluku, will further strengthen this friendship. I wish to reaffirm here to the Albanian comrades that the seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered and made even stronger by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to be a strong rear guard for the Albanian people, firmly supporting your revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact and firmly supporting your struggle against imperialism and revisionism. We will forever follow the teachings of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together."

Now, the world is in a new historical period of opposing American imperialism and Soviet revisionism. Let us unite closely with the proletarians of the world, with all oppressed peoples and nations, with all the peoples of various countries who are controlled, enslaved, and invaded by American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and carry the struggle against imperialism headed by the Americans, against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, and against the reactionaries of various countries who follow the Americans and Soviet revisionists to the end.

Down with American imperialism!
Down with Soviet revisionism!
Down with the reactionaries of various countries who follow the Americans and Soviet revisionists!

Long live the fighting friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two armies of China and Albania!
Long live the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!
Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong!

    周恩来同志在欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团宴会上讲话
    英雄阿尔巴尼亚人民高举反帝反修革命大旗
    七亿中国人民誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民坚强后盾
    新华社三十日讯　中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志二十九日在欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团宴会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的贝基尔·巴卢库同志，亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    在我国人民欢庆建国十九周年伟大节日的时候，以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，从反帝反修的最前线来到我国，带来了以阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民崇高的无产阶级的革命友谊。这是继霍查同志和谢胡同志的热情洋溢的贺电之后，又一次对正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民的巨大支持和巨大鼓舞。我代表中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，代表中国共产党、中国政府、中央军委和中央文革，对你们表示最热烈的欢迎和最衷心的感谢。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，坚持马克思列宁主义的革命路线，决心把社会主义革命进行到底。近几年，你们国家开展的生气勃勃的革命化运动，取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。今年，恩维尔·霍查同志提出的教育革命和工人阶级监督的主张，把这个革命化运动推向更加广泛、更加深入发展的阶段。阿尔巴尼亚的革命化运动，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了生产的发展，加强了国防，巩固了无产阶级专政。这是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党把马克思列宁主义同阿尔巴尼亚的革命具体实践相结合的伟大胜利。你们为在社会主义国家中如何防止资本主义复辟，提供了宝贵的经验，对国际共产主义运动作出了巨大的贡献。
    中国人民为阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲的伟大的社会主义的明灯放射出日益灿烂的光芒，感到无比的欢欣鼓舞。
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民高举反帝反修的革命大旗，在同美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义大搏斗的每一个关键时刻，总是以大无畏的英雄气概，站在斗争的最前列，给美帝、苏修一次又一次的沉重打击。不久以前，你们对苏修叛徒集团及其追随者武装占领捷克斯洛伐克的滔天罪行，对捷修领导集团屈膝投降的背叛行为，进行了无情的揭露和愤怒的声讨，坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民和东欧各国人民反对以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，表现了马克思列宁主义的高度原则性和无产阶级国际主义的崇高精神。最近，你们又敢于蔑视苏修这个“庞然大物”，断然宣布退出华沙条约，这是一个非常勇敢的革命行动。它大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝和苏修的威风，对推动东欧人民和世界各国人民反对美帝和苏修的斗争，作出了新的巨大的贡献，赢得了全世界革命人民的热烈赞扬和无限钦佩。
    苏修叛徒集团控制的华沙条约早就变成了侵略性的反社会主义的条约。它同美帝控制的北大西洋公约和其它条约组织一样，是推行新殖民主义的工具，是苏修用来同美帝进行反革命交易、重新瓜分世界、划分势力范围的一种手段。现在，全世界人民越来越清楚地看到，苏修和美帝完全是一路货。美帝放手侵略越南，苏修放手侵略捷克斯洛伐克，美帝、苏修互相勾结阴谋出卖阿拉伯人民，这一切，都证明美帝和苏修叛徒集团都是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。西欧人民，东欧人民，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民要取得解放，就必须把美帝控制的北大西洋公约和苏修叛徒集团控制的华沙条约以及其它侵略性条约彻底埋葬，就必须坚决打倒以美帝为首的帝国主义，坚决打倒以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义。
    苏修叛徒集团在侵占捷克斯洛伐克之后，最近又利用华沙条约的名义陈兵保加利亚，加强对保加利亚人民的控制和掠夺，严重威胁社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚和巴尔干各国人民的安全。
    高举马克思列宁主义大旗的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，在苏修的威胁面前，勇敢地领导和动员全国人民提高警惕、加强战备，举国上下，斗志昂扬，准备迎头痛击一切胆敢来犯的敌人。阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志说，“能够吓倒阿尔巴尼亚人的好汉，过去没有，现在也还没有生出来。捍卫着阿尔巴尼亚边界和阿尔巴尼亚国土的人民和党，将迎头痛击一切胆敢侵犯他们的人。”这充分体现了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民不畏强暴、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的雄心壮志。
    苏联社会帝国主义在加紧对东欧进行侵略威胁的时候，也进一步加强对中国的武装挑衅。它配合美帝大搞反华包围圈，在中苏和中蒙边境大量驻扎军队，并且加紧派遣飞机侵犯中国领空，不断制造边境紧张局势。它这样做，绝不表现它的强大，而是表现它的理亏、心虚和胆怯。
    我们要严正警告苏修叛徒集团，你们从美帝国主义那里学来的那一套军事威胁和战争讹诈的办法，对于用马克思列宁主义武装起来的阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民，是毫无用处的。如果你们胆敢冒天下之大不韪，侵略社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，阿尔巴尼亚人民是不会饶过你们的，中国人民是不会饶过你们的，全世界革命人民是不会饶过你们的。等待着你们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。
    同志们！中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队在反帝反修的斗争中建立起来的革命友谊，是经得起任何考验的。这一次，以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国，必将进一步加强这种友谊。我愿在这里向阿尔巴尼亚同志重申，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民，誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾，坚决支持你们退出华沙条约的革命行动，坚决支持你们反帝反修的斗争。我们将永远遵循中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的教导，“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    现在，全世界正处在一个反对美帝、反对苏修的历史新时期。让我们同全世界的无产者，同一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族，同一切受美帝和苏修控制、奴役和侵略的各国人民紧密地团结在一起，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义、反对以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和紧随美帝、苏修的各国反动派的斗争进行到底。
    打倒美帝！
    打倒苏修！
    打倒紧随美帝、苏修的各国反动派！
    中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队的战斗友谊万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
