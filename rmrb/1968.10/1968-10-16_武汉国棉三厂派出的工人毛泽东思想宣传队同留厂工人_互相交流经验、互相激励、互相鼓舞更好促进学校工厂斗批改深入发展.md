The revolutionary committee of Wuhan Cotton Mill No. 3, with the assistance of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, has organized various forms of exchanges among the workers. By sharing the achievements of the factory's workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in leading the educational revolution in schools, they have promoted the struggle-criticism-transformation in the factory. Conversely, the factory's achievements in struggle-criticism-transformation have inspired the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to better lead the educational revolution in schools. This has significantly promoted the deepening of the struggle-criticism-transformation in both schools and factories.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it must be led by the working class, with the participation of the working masses, in conjunction with the PLA soldiers, and with the active elements among the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle-criticism-transformation in the schools, and forever lead the schools." Following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions, Wuhan Cotton Mill No. 3 selected outstanding industrial workers to join the first workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in Wuhan, entering schools and taking the stage of struggle-criticism-transformation in the superstructure. Under the leadership of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entering the schools closely followed the great leader Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions without any omissions, actively united with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, and severely struck down a handful of class enemies, achieving great success and producing many good deeds. These vivid facts have made the factory's revolutionary committee deeply realize that the great role played by the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in leading the struggle-criticism-transformation in schools is also a great driving force for carrying out the struggle-criticism-transformation in the factory. The factory revolutionary committee not only has the responsibility to send outstanding workers to join the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to lead the struggle-criticism-transformation in the superstructure but also to make good use of the achievements of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in leading the educational revolution as a strong wind to promote the struggle-criticism-transformation in the unit and to use the achievements of the struggle-criticism-transformation in the unit to promote the better work of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. In this way, not only can the struggle-criticism-transformation in schools and factories promote and drive each other, but it is also an important aspect of better playing the leading role of the working class in the struggle-criticism-transformation.

On the basis of a unified understanding, the factory revolutionary committee and the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team promptly invited the factory's workers who participated in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to return to the factory to give reports, held small-scale symposiums in workshops and teams to exchange experiences in struggle-criticism-transformation, and used various forms to spread the good deeds of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. They promptly published the good news from the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and organized the factory workers to visit and tour the units where the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team was stationed. Through these activities, the sense of responsibility of the broad masses of workers to do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation in the factory was greatly enhanced. They said, as long as the working class has a heart of loyalty to Chairman Mao, resolutely acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, it will definitely be able to lead everything. Many old workers in the factory, in connection with the class struggle situation in the factory, courageously exposed the sabotage crimes of a handful of class enemies, reported the situation to the factory revolutionary committee, provided clues, and put forward suggestions for carrying out the struggle against the enemy. The factory revolutionary committee, based on the experience of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in schools in severely grasping class struggle and the suggestions of old workers, seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, compared and checked, found gaps, and relied on the workers to quickly launch a high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation in the factory.

The revolutionary committee of Wuhan Cotton Mill No. 3 and the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team also paid special attention to using various forms and methods to introduce the good situation in the factory to the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team sent out by the factory, inspiring and encouraging them to do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation in schools. They often sent people to tell the workers participating in the propaganda team about the new situation of revolution and production in the factory, transmit the experience of struggle-criticism-transformation, and organize the workers who stayed in the factory and the workers participating in the propaganda team to carry out heart-to-heart talks, introducing the good deeds that emerged in the factory during the struggle-criticism-transformation. Through these activities, the confidence and determination of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation in schools were further enhanced. The two revolutionary mass organizations of Wuhan Institute of Iron and Steel, under the instigation of a handful of class enemies, had long been engaged in "internal warfare," making the school a "hard-to-handle" unit. After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team composed of outstanding workers from Wuhan Cotton Mill No. 3 and other factories entered, the team members thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and the revolutionary spirit of the workers in the factory in overcoming various difficulties in the struggle-criticism-transformation, and with full confidence, they worked together with the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and enthusiastically reminisce about hardships and talk about their hearts. After a period of painstaking and meticulous ideological and political work, the two revolutionary mass organizations in the school quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and launched a high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation.

    武汉国棉三厂派出的工人毛泽东思想宣传队同留厂工人
    互相交流经验、互相激励、互相鼓舞更好促进学校工厂斗批改深入发展
    新华社武汉十三日电　武汉国棉三厂革命委员会，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队协助下，通过各种形式，互相交流情况，以本厂派出的工人毛泽东思想宣传队领导学校教育革命取得的成绩，推动本厂的斗、批、改，又以本厂斗、批、改的成果，鼓舞本厂派出的工人毛泽东思想宣传队搞好学校的教育革命，从而大大促进了学校和工厂斗、批、改的深入发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。”遵照伟大领袖毛主席的指示，武汉国棉三厂选派优秀产业工人参加了武汉第一支工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进入学校，登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的政治舞台。在省、市革委会领导下，进入学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地落实毛主席的最新指示，积极团结教育广大革命师生，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人，取得了很大成绩，涌现出了许多好人好事。这些生动的事实使该厂革委会深刻认识到，工人毛泽东思想宣传队在领导学校斗、批、改中显示的伟大作用，也是搞好本厂斗、批、改的巨大动力。厂革委会不仅有责任派出优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队，领导上层建筑的斗、批、改，也要善于借工人毛泽东思想宣传队在领导教育革命中的成就这股强劲的东风推动本单位的斗、批、改，并以本单位斗、批、改的成果推动工人毛泽东思想宣传队更好地工作。这样，不仅可以使学校和工厂的斗、批、改起到互相促进、互相推动的作用，同时也是更好地发挥工人阶级在斗、批、改中的领导作用的一个重要方面。
    在统一认识的基础上，厂革委会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队及时邀请本厂参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的队员回厂作报告，在车间、班组召开小型座谈会，交流斗、批、改的经验，以各种形式传播工人毛泽东思想宣传队的好人好事，及时公布工人毛泽东思想宣传队传来的喜讯，组织本厂工人到工人毛泽东思想宣传队所在的单位去参观访问。通过这些活动有力地提高了广大工人搞好本厂斗、批、改的责任感。他们说，咱们工人阶级只要有一颗对毛主席的赤胆忠心，坚决照毛主席的指示办事，就一定能领导一切。厂里许多老工人，联系本厂阶级斗争的情况，大胆揭发一小撮阶级敌人的破坏罪行，向厂革委会反映情况，提供线索，提出开展对敌斗争的建议。厂革委会根据工人毛泽东思想宣传队在学校狠抓阶级斗争的经验和老工人的建议，认真学习了毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，对照检查，大找差距，依靠工人，在厂里迅速掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。
    武汉国棉三厂革委会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，还特别重视以各种形式和方法，向本厂派出的工人毛泽东思想宣传队介绍本厂的大好形势，激励、鼓舞他们安心搞好学校的斗、批、改。他们经常派人向参加宣传队的工人们大讲本厂革命、生产的新气象，传送斗、批、改的经验，发动留在工厂的工人和参加宣传队的工人们开展谈心活动，介绍厂里在斗、批、改中涌现的好人好事。通过这些活动，又进一步增强了工人毛泽东思想宣传队搞好学校斗、批、改的信心和决心。武汉钢铁学院的两派革命群众组织，在一小撮阶级敌人的煽动下，过去长期打“内战”，这个学校是个“老大难”单位。由武汉国棉三厂和其他工厂的优秀工人组成的工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻以后，队员们想到毛主席的教导，和厂里工人同志们在斗、批、改中克服重重困难的革命精神，就信心百倍地同革命师生员工一道，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，热情地找学生忆苦谈心。经过一段时间艰苦细致的思想政治工作，学校的两派革命群众很快就实现了革命大联合，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。
