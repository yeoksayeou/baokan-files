National agricultural labor model and member of the Revolutionary Committee of Yicheng County, Shanxi, Comrade Wu Chun'an, led the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to Yicheng Middle School. As usual, he was taken to the teachers' dining hall to eat. Old Wu thought as he ate, "Why aren't there any students? How come only adults are eating, and no children?" He inquired and found out that this was the teachers' small dining hall, and the students were eating "big pot meals" separately!

This incident reminded Old Wu of his past: when he worked for the landlord in Tulou Village, didn't he eat coarse porridge, while the landlord ate steamed buns? How could there still be such a special phenomenon in a revolutionary school? Chairman Mao said, we should have officers and soldiers in unity, teachers and students should eat from the same pot!

After the meal, Old Wu shared his thoughts with the propaganda team members. Everyone agreed with Old Wu's view, saying, "In school, it should be like in the liberating army, why should teachers and students have two separate pots?" The next day, Old Wu and his team quietly took their bowls to the students' dining hall to eat.

The teachers' dining hall at Yicheng Middle School had been in existence since the school was established. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards rebelled against it and stopped it for over a year. Later, some teachers, using the excuse that "students and teachers cannot be absolutely equal" and "the big pot has less side dishes and insufficient nutrition," restored the small dining hall. Old Wu's opinion about the small dining hall reached the teachers' ears, and they started discussing it. Most teachers agreed that Old Wu was right, the small dining hall was a reflection of privileged thinking, and it should be immediately abolished. Some teachers said, "This is making a mountain out of a molehill."

Old Wu took the lead in eating at the students' big pot, which had a good influence. Almost all the teachers and staff voluntarily left the small dining hall and ate with the students at the big pot. Teachers and students eating from the same pot may seem like a small matter, but its significance is not small. Teachers and students study together, labor together, and eat together every day, bringing their hearts closer. Teachers deeply felt, "The big pot meal is a 'heart-connecting meal,' it's great." The Red Guards also happily said, "In the future, we will better obey the poor and lower-middle peasants' management and education of us, and together with the teachers, strive to achieve ideological revolutionization."

    “连心饭”
    全国农业劳动模范、山西翼城县革委会常委吴春安同志率领工农毛泽东思想宣传队进驻翼城中学后，照例被引到教师灶上去吃饭。老吴一边吃，一边想：“咋不见学生呢？一家人吃饭，咋光见大人，不见小娃？”他一打听，才知道这里是教师的小灶，学生单另吃“大锅饭”哩！
    这件事引起了老吴的回忆：当年在凸里村给地主扛活，自己不是吃糠窝窝，老财不是吃白馍馍吗！在革命的学校里咋还有这种特殊现象呢？毛主席说，要官兵一致，当老师的和当学生的在一个锅里吃饭才对呀！
    饭后，老吴把自己的心思告诉了宣传队的同志们，大伙儿都同意老吴的看法，说：“在学校里，还不和解放军的官兵一样嘛，为啥教师和学生要搭两个锅呢！”第二天，老吴他们就不声不响地拿着饭碗到学生灶上吃饭了。
    翼中的教师灶，是从建校以来就有的。文化大革命初期，红卫兵小将们造了它的反，停了一年多。可是，后来一部分教师又借口“学生和教师不能绝对平均”、“大灶副食少，营养不足”，就把小灶又恢复了。老吴对小灶的意见传到了教师的耳朵里，大家就议论开了，多数教师认为，老吴说得对，小灶是特权思想的反映，应该立即撤销。也有的教师说：“这是小题大做。”
    老吴带头到学生的大灶去吃饭，影响很好，绝大部分教职员都自觉地离开了小灶，和学生一起吃大灶。教师们和学生在一个锅里吃饭，看起来事小，意义可不小。教师和学生每天上课在一起，劳动在一起，吃饭也在一起，把心就贴在一起了。教师们深有体会地说：“大灶饭是‘连心饭’，好极了。”红卫兵小将也高兴地说：“今后，我们要更好地服从贫下中农对我们的管理和教育，和老师们一道，努力实现思想革命化。”
