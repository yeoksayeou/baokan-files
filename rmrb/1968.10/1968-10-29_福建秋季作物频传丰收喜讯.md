Under the great banner of Chairman Mao's "Grasp revolution, promote production," the autumn agricultural production in Fujian Province is thriving. In the northern part of Fujian, 400 million mu of late-season crops are growing well. The harvest news of single-season late rice, mixed grains, and sweet potatoes, which have already been harvested over a large area, is frequently reported. The late rice in the southern part of Fujian is also growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. This is a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in Fujian Province have, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and the launch of the "Three Loyalty" campaign (loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line), made Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible, widely known throughout the province, greatly changing people's spiritual outlook. With deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, the broad masses of commune members have worked hard, fought against class enemies, fought against nature, and fought against natural disasters, achieving a good harvest this autumn.

The revolutionary criticism is a powerful driving force for the vigorous development of agricultural production. During the summer and autumn, the rural areas across the province have carried out in-depth and sustained criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "three selfs and one package" and "work points as the commander" promoted by China's Khrushchev. This has greatly enhanced the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, making them further establish the idea of farming for revolution. The poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members in various places in Nanping have turned the intense hatred for class enemies aroused in the revolutionary criticism into a great material force. Everyone has carried on the style of continuous fighting, strengthened the work of preventing drought, wind, pests, and diseases, and focused on field management in the later stage. Now, the late rice in the whole area is expected to have a bumper harvest. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Longxi area have followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They have overcome drought and pest disasters, ensuring timely planting and normal growth of crops. The area of late rice planted this year has increased by 4,200 mu compared to the same period last year.

Many county and commune cadres across the province have gone deep into the grassroots, eating, living, and working with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They have implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions together, conducted investigations and research, and promoted the advanced experience of units that have grasped revolution and promoted production. This has effectively promoted the revolution and production, contributing to the bumper harvest of autumn crops in the province this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    福建秋季作物频传丰收喜讯
    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，福建省秋季农业生产形势一片大好。闽北地区四百万亩晚秋作物，普遍生长良好，其中已开镰收割的大面积单季晚稻和杂粮、番薯，丰收喜讯频传。闽南地区晚稻也长势喜人，丰收在望。这是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    福建省各级革命委员会，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班和开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，使战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全省空前大普及，人的精神面貌大改观。广大社员怀着对毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，大鼓干劲，与阶级敌人斗，与天斗，与地斗，与自然灾害斗，夺得了秋季好收成。
    革命的大批判，是推动农业生产蓬勃发展的强大动力。全省各地农村在夏秋期间，深入持久地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“三自一包”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，大大地提高了广大贫下中农和社员群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，使他们进一步树立起了为革命种田的思想。南平各地贫下中农和社员群众，把革命大批判中激发起来的对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，化为巨大的物质力量，大家发扬连续作战的作风，切实加强防旱、防风、防兽、防虫灭病等工作，大抓田间后期管理，现在全区晚稻丰收在望。龙溪地区广大贫下中农遵循毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，战胜了干旱和虫灾，保证了适时种植和作物的正常生长。全区今年的晚稻实种面积比去年同期扩大了四千二百亩。
    全省许多县、社干部深入基层，和贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，一起落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，进行调查研究，推广抓革命、促生产先进单位的典型经验，有力地推动了革命和生产，为全省夺取今年秋季作物的丰收作出了贡献。（据新华社）（附图片）
