The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing forward, and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the land of our motherland. People's spiritual faces have undergone a tremendous change, and miracles are constantly emerging. Recently, news from Jilin Province has brought a heartening message: The medical propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought from the medical department of Unit 3016 of the People's Liberation Army has, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, used acupuncture to break through the "forbidden zone" of deaf-mutes, making the mute speak. In the entire school of 168 students, 129 have regained their hearing, 125 can loudly shout "Long live Chairman Mao," "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life," and 47 can sing "The East Is Red" loudly, stepping onto the stage of propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The silent deaf-mute school has become lively

In recent months, people have been visiting and touring the Liaoyuan Deaf-Mute School in an endless stream. When people see and hear the deaf-mute students together shouting "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life" and singing "The East Is Red," they are all amazed and cannot help but praise!

Half a year ago, this school was silent from morning to night. Students communicated with each other using gestures and at most could only make a few indistinct sounds that could not express their thoughts. Now, whether in the classroom or on the playground, from morning to night, it is filled with laughter. "Long live Chairman Mao," "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life" can be heard at any time; the songs of "The East Is Red" and Mao's quotations are rising and falling. A Mao Zedong Thought propaganda troupe composed of 35 deaf-mute students, with 22 performances they themselves arranged, went to factories, mines, military units, and rural areas to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Wherever they went, they were warmly welcomed by the masses and caused a strong response. People said: Mutes can go on stage to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, this is the first time in history! Under the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, even a thousand-year-old iron tree can bloom!

In early May, the Liaoyuan Mining Bureau held a conference of active learners and users of Mao Zedong Thought, specially inviting this propaganda troupe to perform. As soon as the curtain was opened, a miner's daughter, Wang Yajin, who had been mute for 17 years, spoke with clear and loud emotions to the audience: "A thousand-year-old iron tree has bloomed, a ten-thousand-year-old withered vine has borne fruit, and now the mute can speak, all thanks to Chairman Mao..." Immediately, the entire venue was filled with cheers, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao" on and off the stage lasted for a long time. As soon as the performance ended, several old miners rushed onto the stage, hugged the young performers, and stroked their heads, saying: "Children, children! In the old society, even if we poor people could speak, we were not allowed to. In the new society, even those who cannot speak, the mute, can speak. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao!"

Determined to break through the "forbidden zone" of deaf-mutes

In March of this year, the medical department of Unit 3016 of the People's Liberation Army, in order to implement Chairman Mao's series of instructions on medical work, formed a Mao Zedong Thought medical propaganda team and came to the deaf-mute school. They propagated Mao Zedong Thought while treating the deaf-mute students with acupuncture. This propaganda team consisted of three military doctors and five medical personnel, among whom only one had attended a few days of junior high school, and the rest had only primary school education. None of them had attended a medical school.

After the Mao Zedong Thought medical propaganda team arrived at the deaf-mute school, the students were all excited and overjoyed. They pulled the hands of the propaganda team members and waved them in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, expressing their shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The students' parents heard the good news and spread it around: "Chairman Mao has sent the People's Liberation Army to treat our children!" Facing this scene, the team members felt warm at heart. They stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swore: We must definitely cure the deaf-mute students' diseases and let Chairman Mao's great voice be heard by these class brothers and sisters; let Chairman Mao's warm care be sent to their hearts.

The news of the medical propaganda team treating the deaf-mute students with acupuncture shocked those so-called "famous doctors" and "experts." They discussed and said: "Treating deaf-mute diseases, there is no such chapter in foreign books! Treating the mute with a few dry needles is simply nonsense!" "A few young soldiers, what have they seen in the world, they can treat deaf-mute diseases!" These sarcastic remarks made the soldiers so angry that they stamped their feet. They encouraged themselves with Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our Chinese nation has the spirit of fighting to the end with our enemies, the determination to restore the old on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand among the nations of the world." The soldiers said: What "famous doctors" and "experts," eating the people's food and not doing anything for the people, believing in foreign rules and books, willingly bowing down to foreigners, following others to crawl, where is there any Chinese spirit! We must rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and use a shining silver needle to definitely break through the "forbidden zone" of deaf-mutes.

In order to understand the cause and effect of the disease and enhance the therapeutic effect, the medical propaganda team members conducted a survey of the condition of each deaf-mute student. They learned that these children were over 97% the children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. In the old society, the working people were exploited by landlords and capitalists, unable to eat and dress warmly, and children's illnesses could not be treated! In the new society, Chairman Mao cares infinitely for the working people and has issued a series of important instructions on medical and health work. However, Liu Shaoqi in the medical and health field pushed a counter-revolutionary revisionist line, the hospital doors were not open to the working people, making the working people unable to receive timely treatment when they were ill, delaying treatment and becoming disabled. Old worker Wang Yuhai of Liaoyuan Coal Mine was tortured by capitalists before liberation. Until after liberation, at the age of forty, he got married and had a daughter named Wang Yajin. When Wang Yajin was three years old, she fell ill, and because she could not afford the hospital fees, the treatment was delayed, and she became mute. Wang Yuhai and his wife were full of hope that the famous doctors in the hospital would cure their only daughter's illness, but the "famous doctors" said: "Mutes are mutes, foreigners can't cure them, what can we do!" Worker Zhang Zhenfang's child Zhang Lifeng is also a mute. He once took his child to a large hospital and found a "famous doctor" to see him. This "famous doctor" wore a reflective mirror on his head and only shook it by the child's ear, then decisively said: "The eardrum is damaged, even if treated, it will still be mute, you might as well give up this idea!" This old worker thus entered the hospital with hope and returned home with tears.

The team members, holding a stack of condition registration forms, felt even more deeply the proletarian feelings for the working people and deepened their hatred for Liu Shaoqi. The comrades said: "This is not a registration form, but a blood-stained indictment against Liu Shaoqi." The comrades turned hatred into strength and decided to relieve the pain of the deaf-mute students. They wrote on the wall and remembered in their hearts Chairman Mao's teachings: "Serve the people wholeheartedly," "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and vowed to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to poke the "hornet's nest" of "incurable diseases."

Treat the disease with deep proletarian feelings

In order to see the effect of every needle, the team members first repeatedly experimented on themselves. In the experiment, they gave needles to each other, some practiced in front of the mirror, and many comrades had their necks swollen, ears buzzing, and mouths aching so much that they could hardly eat. Even so, they did not stop. They were willing to take on all kinds of risks and suffer all kinds of pain for the sake of their class brothers' happiness. They proposed: Without absolute confidence, they would not give a single needle to the deaf-mute students.

The Yamen point is an important acupuncture point for treating deaf-mute diseases. Bourgeois "famous doctors" and "experts" have designated it as a "forbidden point." In the old acupuncture books, it is also stipulated that it can only be needled three to five fen deep. But practice has proved that needling to this depth does not produce good results. Can it be deeper? The "authorities" said that needling to one inch at this point will make a good person mute; needling over one inch and five fen will be dangerous to life. If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger? The team members, knowing that there are tigers in the mountains, dared to go to the tiger mountains. Medical personnel Zhao Puyu first experimented on his own Yamen point. When he needled to a depth of one inch, his nerves felt something, his hands became soft, and he thought: What if I really needle myself into muteness? This thought just flashed by, and the five golden words "Serve the people" immediately appeared in front of his eyes. He immediately felt his blood boiling, his courage doubled, and he made up his mind: For the sake of making millions of deaf-mutes shout "Long live Chairman Mao," even if he needles himself into muteness, he would be willing. He did not hesitate and continued to needle. When the silver needle was needled to a depth of one inch and five fen, he felt his head swelling. Needling further would be dangerous to life! But he understood: "To struggle is to have sacrifices, death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, think of the pain of the majority of the people. We die for the people, and we die a worthy death." With a red sun in his heart, every silver needle shines brightly. He only pulled out the needle when he reached the best depth of effect, with his head reacting as if it were electrified. Measuring with his hand, he had needled more than two inches deep.

The medical propaganda team members, through repeated experiments, mastered the new acupuncture method and obtained first-hand experience, and then conducted extensive treatment for the deaf-mute students. After half a month of needling, they finally opened the door to the "forbidden zone" of deaf-mutes. Among the 157 deaf-mute students who received treatment, 70 had significant hearing, and 32 could shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" Zhang Lifeng, who had been judged by "famous doctors" and "experts" as having a damaged eardrum and would remain mute even if treated, shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" for the first time. Qian Shenqi, who had been mute for 15 years, returned home and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" in front of the whole family for the first time, making the whole family surround him, crying with joy and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The surrounding masses heard the news and rushed to congratulate them. Many people sighed and said: The medical warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought are truly great, curing the deaf-mute disease that foreigners cannot cure, and fighting for the honor of the working people!

Let more deaf-mutes sing "The East Is Red" loudly

One day, the responsible comrade of the medical propaganda team, Fang Yingdeng, had a high fever of over 39 degrees and was preparing to return to the camp to rest. As soon as he stepped out, he saw a female student crying by the wall. Fang Yingdeng walked over and found out that it was the daughter of a poor peasant, Wang Shufang. He asked her with concern: "Wang Shufang, what's wrong?" Little Wang pointed to her mouth and then pointed to other classmates, meaning that other classmates could shout "Long live Chairman Mao" and sing "The East Is Red," but she could not shout or sing, and she felt sad.

Indeed, the best language for the working people to express their love for the great leader Chairman Mao is to shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The most resounding song to praise the great leader Chairman Mao is "The East Is Red." As medical workers of the people, we should do our best to help more deaf-mutes realize this most beautiful wish. Fang Yingdeng thought of this and felt a heavy responsibility. He did not care about his own illness and gave up his personal rest to examine Wang Shufang's hearing. Old Fang clapped his hands behind, and Little Wang raised one finger in front, clapped twice and raised two fingers. According to reason, if the hearing is restored, speaking is possible, why is this child not like this? Old Fang puzzled for a while and examined further, finding that her tongue's frenulum was as thick as a hemp rope, pulling her tongue tightly and unable to move freely, so she could not speak. From this female student, Fang Yingdeng thought of other students who could not speak, whether it was the same reason as Wang Shufang. He and the team members examined those who could not speak after needling one by one. Indeed, 32 students could not speak because their frenulum was too short.

The deaf-mute students' desire to sing "The East Is Red" urged Fang Yingdeng to quickly find a way to treat the short frenulum. On that very night, Fang Yingdeng, with a high fever not yet subsided, worked while ill, flipped through acupuncture books, and looked at many medical magazines, but did not find the answer. What to do? He followed Chairman Mao's teachings, believing that "the masses are the real heroes," and the next morning, he came to the team members and held a "Zhuge Liang meeting." The soldiers said: "Things not found in books, we can create them in practice and write them down; paths not taken by others, we can blaze and walk them." Everyone offered strategies and suggestions, and after serious discussion, decided to use surgical methods to repair the frenulum. With the approval of the military party committee, the team members made sufficient preparations and performed surgery on the students, all of whom were successful. Female student Wang Shufang had her frenulum repaired the next day and could clearly shout "Long live Chairman Mao" the next day!

"Iron trees bloom, mutes speak." People often use these two phrases to describe things that cannot be done. Today, under the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, many things that were previously considered impossible have been accomplished one by one. The example of the Mao Zedong Thought medical propaganda team of Unit 3016 treating deaf-mute diseases has once again proven that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force, able to overcome any difficulty and create any miracle.

    靠毛泽东思想打开了聋哑“禁区”
    ——三○一六部队卫生科毛泽东思想医疗宣传队在辽源聋哑学校治疗聋哑病的事迹
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前，毛泽东思想的光辉普照着祖国的大地；人们的精神面貌发生了天翻地覆的变化，人间奇迹不断涌现出来。最近，从吉林省传来了一个振奋人心的消息：解放军某部三○一六部队卫生科驻辽源聋哑学校毛泽东思想医疗宣传队，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，用银针捅开了聋哑“禁区”的大门，使哑巴说了话。全校一百六十八名学生，一百二十九名有了听力，一百二十五名能高呼“毛主席万岁”，“祝毛主席万寿无疆”，四十七名能高唱《东方红》，登上了宣传毛泽东思想的舞台。
    这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果！
    寂静的聋哑学校欢腾起来了
    近几个月来，到辽源聋哑学校参观、访问的人络绎不断。当人们亲眼看见、亲耳听到聋哑学生共祝“毛主席万寿无疆”、高唱《东方红》的时候，都惊奇地赞叹不绝！
    半年前，这个学校从早到晚一片寂静，同学之间相互往来，只能用手势比比划划来代替语言，至多也只能依依呀呀地发出几声不能表达思想的声音。如今，不论是教室里、操场上，从早到晚，充满着欢笑。“毛主席万岁”，“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆”的欢呼声，随时都可以听到；《东方红》和毛主席语录歌声此伏彼起。由三十五名聋哑学生组成的毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，带着自己编排的二十二个说唱节目，到工厂、矿山、部队、农村，向广大工农兵宣传毛泽东思想。他们所到之处，受到群众的热烈欢迎，引起强烈的反响。人们都说：哑巴能登台宣传毛泽东思想，这还是开天辟地第一回哩！在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，真是千年的铁树也能开花！
    五月上旬，辽源矿务局召开活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会，特意邀请了这支宣传队去演出。幕布一拉开，一个聋哑了十七年的矿工女儿王雅琴，满怀激情，用清晰嘹亮的声音向大家报幕：“千年的铁树开了花，万年的枯藤结了瓜，而今聋哑人能说话，全靠毛主席他老人家……”顿时，全场欢声雷动，台上台下，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声经久不息。演出一结束，几位老矿工跑上台去，把小演员们搂在怀里，抚摸着他们的头说：“孩子呀，孩子！旧社会咱穷人能说话都不让咱说，新社会不能说话的聋哑人也能说话了，这全是托毛主席他老人家的福啊！”
    一定要捅开聋哑“禁区”的大门
    今年三月，三○一六部队卫生科，为了落实毛主席对卫生工作的一系列指示，组成了一支毛泽东思想医疗宣传队来到聋哑学校，一面宣传毛泽东思想，一面为聋哑学生扎针治病。这支宣传队由三名军医、五名卫生员组成，其中除了一个人念过几天初中，其余都是高小文化程度，谁也没上过医务学校。
    毛泽东思想医疗宣传队来到聋哑学校后，学生们个个手舞足蹈，欢喜若狂。他们拉着宣传队同志的手，在毛主席像前来回挥动，表示高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”学生家长们听到这个喜讯，也奔走相告：“毛主席派亲人解放军来给孩子治病啦！”面对这种情景，宣传队的同志们心里感到热呼呼的，他们站在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：一定要把聋哑学生的病治好，让您老人家的伟大声音传到这些阶级兄妹的耳朵里；把您老人家的亲切关怀送到他们的心坎上。
    医疗宣传队为聋哑学生扎针治病的消息，震动了那些所谓“名医”、“专家”们。他们议论纷纷，说：“治疗聋哑病，外国书上那来这一章？凭着几根干针治哑巴，简直是瞎胡闹！”“几个娃娃兵，见过多大世面，治得了什么聋哑病！”这些冷嘲热讽的话，战士们听了气得直跺脚。他们用毛主席的教导勉励自己：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”战士们说：什么“名医”、“专家”，吃了人民的饭，不为人民办事，迷信洋条条、洋本本，甘愿拜倒在洋人脚下，跟着别人爬行，那里有一点中国人的骨气！咱们就是要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，凭着一根闪闪发光的银针，一定要捅开聋哑“禁区”的大门。
    为了掌握病情的来龙去脉，增强疗效，医疗宣传队同志对每一个聋哑学生进行了病情考察。他们了解到，这些孩子百分之九十七以上都是工人、贫下中农的子女。在旧社会，劳动人民被地主、资本家压榨得吃不饱、穿不暖，孩子生病治不起！在新社会，毛主席无限关怀劳动人民，对医疗卫生工作发出了一系列重要指示。可是中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线上推行了一条反革命修正主义路线，医院大门不为劳动人民开，使劳动人民患病后得不到及时治疗，延误成残废。辽源煤矿老工人王玉海，解放前受尽了资本家的折磨，直到解放后四十来岁才结婚，生了个女孩叫王雅琴。王雅琴三岁时，得了病，因为拿不出住院费，耽误了治疗，成了哑巴。王玉海老两口满心希望医院的名大夫把独生女儿的病治好，可是，“名大夫”们说：“哑巴就是哑巴，外国人都治不了，我们还有啥办法！”工人张振方的孩子张立风也是个哑巴，他曾带着孩子到一所大医院里，找了位“名医”看。这位“名医”头上戴个反光镜，只是在孩子耳边晃了晃，就断然地说：
  “耳鼓膜坏了，再治也是哑巴，你就死了这条心吧！”这位老工人就这样怀着希望进医院，含着眼泪回家门。
    宣传队的同志们拿着一张张的病情登记表，更加增强了对劳动人民的深厚无产阶级感情，加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨。战士们说：“这不是登记表，这是对中国赫鲁晓夫血泪斑斑的控诉书。”同志们化仇恨为力量，决心为聋哑学生解除痛苦。他们把毛主席教导的“全心全意地为人民服务”，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，写在墙上，记在心里，立志用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，去捅“不治之症”这个“马蜂窝”。
    带着深厚的无产阶级感情治病
    为了针针见功效，宣传队的同志首先在自己身上反复作扎针试验。在试验中，你给我扎，我给你扎，有的对着镜子自己扎，不少同志把脖子扎肿了，耳朵扎得嗡嗡响，嘴巴扎得吃饭都困难，就是这样也不停息。他们宁愿自己担千般风险，受万般痛苦，也要为阶级兄弟换来幸福。他们提出：没有十分把握，决不在聋哑学生身上扎一针。
    哑门穴是治聋哑病的一个重要穴位，资产阶级“名医”、“专家”们把它划为“禁穴”。在旧针灸书上也规定：只能扎三至五分。但实践证明，扎到这个深度却收不到良好效果。能不能再深一些呢？“权威”们又说，在这个穴位上扎到一寸，好人也会变哑；扎过一寸五分，生命就有危险。不入虎穴，焉得虎子。宣传队的同志们明知山有虎，偏向虎山行。卫生员赵普羽首先在自己的哑门穴上进行了试扎。当他把银针扎进一寸深时，神经有了感觉，手有些软，心想：真要把自己扎成哑巴怎么办？这个念头刚一闪现，“为人民服务”五个金光闪闪的大字立刻展现在眼前，他立刻浑身热血沸腾，勇气倍增，暗暗下定决心：为了使千万个聋哑人都能喊“毛主席万岁”，就是把自己扎成哑巴也心甘情愿。他毫不犹豫地又继续进针。银针扎到一寸五分时，他感到脑子发胀。再往下扎会有生命危险呀！但他懂得：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”心中有个红太阳，只只银针放红光。他一直扎到头部象通电一样的反应，达到疗效最好的深度时，才拔出针来。用手一量，已经扎了二寸多深。
    医疗宣传队的同志经过反复试验，掌握了新针法，取得了第一手经验，就对聋哑学生进行了广泛治疗。经过半个月的扎针，终于把聋哑“禁区”的大门打开了。在接受治疗的一百五十七名聋哑学生中，七十人有了明显听力，其中三十二人能高呼“毛主席万岁！”过去曾被“名医”“专家”们作结论说“耳鼓膜坏了，再治也是哑巴”的张立风，第一次喊出了“毛主席万岁！”哑了十五年的钱深歧，回到家里，当着全家人的面，第一次喊出了“毛主席万岁”，高兴得一家人团团围在一起，含着热泪齐声呼喊“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”周围群众知道了这个消息，也纷纷赶来向他们贺喜。不少人感叹地说：用毛泽东思想武装起来的卫生战士真是好样的，治好了外国人都治不了的聋哑病，为我们劳动人民争了气！
    让更多的聋哑人放声高唱《东方红》
    一天，医疗宣传队的负责同志方应登，发高烧到三十九度多，准备回营房休息。一出门，碰见个女学生站在墙边擦眼泪，方应登走近一看，原来是贫农女儿王淑芳。便关切地问她：“王淑芳，你怎么啦？”小王指指自己的嘴巴，又用手指了指其他同学，意思是说：别的同学都能喊“毛主席万岁”，高唱《东方红》，自己不能喊不能唱，心里难受。
    是啊，劳动人民热爱伟大领袖毛主席的最好语言，就是高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”颂扬伟大领袖毛主席最响亮的歌就是《东方红》。作为人民的医务工作人员，应当尽最大的努力，帮助更多的聋哑人实现这个最美好的愿望。方应登想到这里，感到责任重大。他不管自己身体有病，放弃个人的休息，给王淑芳检查起听力来。老方在后面拍一下掌，小王在前边伸一个指头，拍两下伸两个。按理说，听力恢复了，说话就有了可能，为什么这个孩子却不是这样呢？老方纳闷了一会，又作了进一步检查，发现她的舌头下边的舌系带，象根麻绳一样粗，把舌头拉得紧紧地，不能自由滚动，所以说不出话来。从这个女学生身上，方应登想到其他学生有的不能说话，是不是也同王淑芳一个原因，他和宣传队的同志一道，对扎针后还吐不出字音的人逐个进行了检查。果然，有三十二名学生都是因为舌系带过短而说不出话来。
    聋哑学生们要求唱《东方红》的那股激情，催促着方应登，要他赶快找出治疗舌系带过短的办法。就在这天深夜，方应登高烧未退，带病工作，翻阅了针灸学，查看了许多医学杂志，都没有找到答案。怎么办？他按照毛主席的教导，相信“群众是真正的英雄”，第二天一早就来到宣传队同志们中间，召开了“诸葛亮会”。战士们说：“书上找不到的东西，在实践中我们可以创造，把它写上去；别人没有走过的路，我们可以闯，把它走出来。”大家纷纷献策献计，经过认真的讨论，决定用外科手术的办法，对舌系带进行修整。经部队党委批准，医疗宣传队的同志们作了充分准备之后，给学生们动了手术，个个获得了成功。女学生王淑芳头天修整了舌系带，第二天就能清楚地高呼：毛主席万岁！
    “铁树开花，哑巴说话。”过去人们常常用这两句话来形容那些办不到的事。今天，毛泽东思想光辉普照祖国大地，许多过去认为办不到的事都一一办到了。三○一六部队毛泽东思想医疗宣传队治疗聋哑病的事例，再一次证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力，什么困难都能克服，什么奇迹都能创造。
