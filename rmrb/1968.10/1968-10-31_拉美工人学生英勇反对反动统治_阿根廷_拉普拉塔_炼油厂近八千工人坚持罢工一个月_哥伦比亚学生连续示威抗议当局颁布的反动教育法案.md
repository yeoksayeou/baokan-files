Nearly 8,000 workers at Argentina's "La Plata" refinery have been on strike for a month

Colombia students continuously protest against the government's reactionary education bill

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, Buenos Aires: Nearly 7,800 workers at Argentina's largest state-owned "La Plata" refinery are continuing their indefinite strike despite threats from the reactionary authorities. Their strike has received active support from oil workers in Comodoro Rivadavia, the most important oil field in southern Argentina.

	The workers at "La Plata" refinery began their indefinite strike on September 25 to protest against management's measures to extend working hours and further exploit workers. During the strike, the reactionary authorities forcibly closed two union organizations at the refinery, dispatched large numbers of infantry, police, police dogs, police cars, and even helicopters to hover at low altitudes over the refinery, suppressing and intimidating the workers; at the same time, the management fired more than 150 workers in an attempt to disrupt the strike. However, the striking workers were not intimidated, and their struggle continues.

	To support the just struggle of the workers at "La Plata" refinery, the employees of the Comodoro Rivadavia National Oil Field Management Bureau in southern Argentina announced a 72-hour strike on the 28th to protest against the authorities' exploitation and suppression of workers.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 30th, Bogota: In recent days, Colombian students have continuously held demonstrations to protest against various reactionary measures taken by the reactionary authorities.

	On the 29th, hundreds of students in Bogota, the capital of Colombia, held a rally in the university district to angrily protest against the reactionary education bill issued by the authorities.

	The reactionary authorities dispatched large numbers of police to surround the university district and even stormed into the university, violently suppressing the demonstrating students. The university students bravely resisted, fiercely retaliating against the police's attack with stones. (Photo attached)

    据新华社二十九日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷最大的国营“拉普拉塔”炼油厂的七千八百名工人，不顾反动当局的威吓，目前继续坚持不定期罢工。他们的罢工得到阿根廷南部最重要的石油矿藏地科莫多罗里瓦达维亚的石油工人的积极声援。
    “拉普拉塔”炼油厂的工人为了抗议资方延长劳动时间等加紧剥削工人的措施，在九月二十五日开始举行不定期罢工。在罢工过程中，反动当局强行封闭“拉普拉塔”炼油厂的两个工会组织，出动大批步兵、警察、警犬、警车，甚至出动直升飞机在炼油厂一带低空盘旋，对工人进行镇压和威吓；同时，厂方解雇一百五十几名工人，企图以此来破坏罢工。但是，罢工工人并没有被吓倒，他们的斗争在继续坚持中。
    为声援“拉普拉塔”炼油厂工人的正义斗争，阿根廷南部最重要的科莫多罗里瓦达维亚国家石油矿藏管理局的职工二十八日宣布举行七十二小时大罢工，抗议当局对工人的剥削和镇压。
    据新华社三十日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚大学生近日来连续举行示威，抗议反动当局所采取的一些反动措施。
    二十九日，哥伦比亚首都波哥大的数百名学生在大学区举行集会，愤怒抗议当局颁布的反动教育法案。
