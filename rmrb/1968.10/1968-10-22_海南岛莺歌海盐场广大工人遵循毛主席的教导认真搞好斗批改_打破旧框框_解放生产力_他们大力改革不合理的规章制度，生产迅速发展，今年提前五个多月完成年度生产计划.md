Workers at the Yan'gehai Saltworks in Hainan Island, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, have seriously carried out the "three-in-one" struggle, broken old frameworks, and liberated productive forces. They have vigorously reformed unreasonable regulations and systems, leading to rapid development in production. This year, they completed their annual production plan more than five months ahead of schedule.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Haikou on the 21st, workers at the Yan'gehai Saltworks in Hainan Island, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Navy propaganda team stationed at the saltworks, have been vigorously carrying out the revolution and reforming unreasonable regulations and systems. This has greatly liberated productive forces. This year, they completed their annual state production plan five months and twenty-one days ahead of schedule. The production in the first nine months was more than double the highest annual production in history.

Under the great banner of Chairman Mao's "grasp revolution, promote production," the saltworkers have been transforming the superstructure in the image of the proletariat, promoting the development of productive forces. With the great revolutionary spirit of the working class, they have broken through the old frameworks and vigorously reformed unreasonable regulations and systems, forging a new path of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in production. In the past, the capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" used so-called objective conditions as an excuse to divide the production season into "off-season" and "peak season." Now, the saltworkers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have displayed their wisdom and revolutionary enthusiasm, turning the so-called "off-season" into a "peak season" and achieving "peak season" yields during the "off-season." In the past, the capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" controlled the saltworks, stipulating that if the weather station forecasted rain over Hainan Island, the salt in the salt pans, regardless of whether the rain would reach Yan'gehai, had to be dissolved; in cases of light rain, the brine in the salt pans had to be returned to the sea, claiming that this was the only way to ensure the quality of the salt and protect the salt pan bases. Now, with the proletarian revolutionaries in power, the old saltworkers have voluntarily organized a "weather-watching group." Every night before going to bed, they gather to plan the next day's production, observe the clouds and moon, and combine this with the weather station's forecasts for research. They have thus accurately grasped the local weather changes, basically eliminating the phenomenon of treating no-rain situations as rainy ones, wasting labor achievements.

The revolution has liberated productive forces. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of saltworkers has turned into a great material force. They abolished the capitalist roaders' and bourgeois technical "authorities'" stipulation that each production team could manage no more than forty salt pans. With the high sense of responsibility of the working class, they repaired over three hundred salt pans that had been abandoned for many years. Each team increased the number of salt pans they managed, and the quality of the salt has been continuously improving.

    海南岛莺歌海盐场广大工人遵循毛主席的教导认真搞好斗批改
    打破旧框框  解放生产力
    他们大力改革不合理的规章制度，生产迅速发展，今年提前五个多月完成年度生产计划
    据新华社海口二十一日电　海南岛莺歌海盐场的广大工人，在人民解放军海军某部驻场毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，狠抓革命，改革不合理的规章制度，大大地解放了生产力，今年提前五个月零二十一天完成了年度国家生产计划，头九个月的产量比历史上最高年产量增加了一倍多。
    在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针鼓舞下，盐工们按照无产阶级的面貌改造上层建筑，促进生产力的发展。他们以工人阶级的大无畏革命气概，大破洋框框，狠改不合理的规章制度，在生产中闯出了一条多、快、好、省的新路。过去，走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”以所谓客观条件为借口，把生产季节分为“淡季”和“旺季”。现在，用毛泽东思想武装起来的盐工们发挥了聪明才智和冲天的革命干劲，把所谓“淡季”变成了“旺季”，在“淡季”中夺取了“旺季”的收成。过去，走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”控制盐场，规定凡是气象台预报海南岛有雨，不管雨水能否到达莺歌海，也要把盐池里已经晒成的盐化掉；在雨量不大的情况下，也要把盐池里的卤水放回大海，胡说什么只有这样，才能保证盐的质量和保护池基。现在，无产阶级革命派掌了权，老盐工们就自动组织了一个“看天组”，每夜临睡前聚集在一起，一边计划第二天的生产，一边观云察月，结合气象台的预报进行研究，就比较准确地掌握了当地的气象变化，基本上消除了无雨当有雨处理，白白糟踏劳动成果的现象。
    革命解放了生产力。广大盐工的革命热情，变成了巨大的物质力量。他们废除了走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”规定的每个生产组最多只能管理四十个盐池的框框，以工人阶级的高度责任感，修复了三百多个多年丢荒盐池，每个组都增加了盐池管理数量，把池基维护得很好，盐的质量不断提高。
