Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary workers of Guangzhou Huangpu Port have displayed the spirit of the working class taking charge, focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production. This has led to an unprecedentedly good situation in both revolution and production at the port. Since August this year, the loading and unloading efficiency of Huangpu Port has continuously improved, and the time large ships spend docked has been significantly reduced compared to the past. The port's throughput in August, which was already much higher than in July, increased by 13.3% in September, setting a new record for the year.

Huangpu Port is the largest port in southern China, responsible for the heavy task of transporting international trade goods and supporting the country's industrial and agricultural construction. Under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the port, the situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat at Huangpu Port is getting better and better. Revolutionary workers are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, rooting out a handful of class enemies who fomented counter-revolutionary economicism and anarchism, and foiling their evil plots to sabotage production. They have quickly launched a wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Through a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "material incentives," "money as the commander," and "expert management of the port" promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the port, the class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the revolutionary workers have greatly increased. They have extensively carried out the "three loyalties" activities of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. With the attitude of masters, they actively participate in enterprise management, focus on revolution, vigorously promote production, and voluntarily improve loading and unloading efficiency and quality. In August and September, Huangpu Port had heavy loading and unloading tasks for fertilizers, pesticides, coal, industrial raw materials, and daily necessities. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's great teaching of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory," the revolutionary workers, with high morale, have created a new record of loading and unloading 127 train cars of goods in one day. A 10,000-ton ship, upon entering the port, completed unloading all its goods in just 28 hours, setting a new record for unloading speed this year. When loading and unloading export goods, the workers ensured quality and quantity, loaded and unloaded quickly, and effectively improved transportation efficiency. Currently, the vast number of workers at Huangpu Port are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's instructions to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation," focusing on revolution, vigorously promoting production, and striving to fully and exceedingly complete this year's national transportation tasks.
