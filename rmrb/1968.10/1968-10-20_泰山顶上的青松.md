In the face of difficulties and dangers, what attitude should one adopt: to confront and overcome them, or to compromise and retreat; to regard them as necessary steps toward victory, or as insurmountable obstacles; to find the greatest joy in fighting them, or to see them as the greatest pain and torment—this is the touchstone that distinguishes revolutionary soldiers from opportunists.

The People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is precisely the kind of force that advances in the face of difficulties, tramples them underfoot, regards them as necessary steps toward victory, and finds the greatest joy in fighting them.

In the revolutionary model opera "Shajiabang," the eighteen wounded and sick soldiers of the New Fourth Army, led by Political Commissar Guo Jian'guang, are such soldiers. When the enemy suddenly launched a sweep, they moved to the reed marshes of Shajiabang. They were wounded, cut off from the masses, cut off from their superiors, without food or medicine, with cold wind and rain above and cold water and mud below. In the face of such difficulties and dangers, what attitude did they adopt? Let's see: Guo Jian'guang was calm and composed, fully prepared. He "gazed into the distance at Shajiabang, shrouded in clouds and mist," with not a trace of worry, but instead sang with great enthusiasm: "Stay calm and steadfast in the reed marshes, find medicine and solve the food shortage, mobilize the masses and think of ways, the south bank of the Yangtze has natural granaries!" The eighteen soldiers did not complain once, did not sigh once, but were full of vigor and high morale, "united as one, hearts turned to the Party," "firm as a rock, tempered into steel."

"Be like the evergreen pine on the summit of Mount Tai, standing tall and proud against the sky. Eight thousand miles of storms cannot blow it down, nine thousand thunderbolts cannot shake it. The scorching sun cannot kill it, the severe frost and snow make it lush and green..." This is the heroic spirit of revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought in the face of difficulties and dangers.

The song of these eighteen New Fourth Army soldiers rose from the reed marshes of Shajiabang, transforming into rolling thunder that shook the heavens! The earth-shaking song of these eighteen iron soldiers was louder than eighteen million cannons, more soaring than eighteen million waves of the sea!

Where did this earth-shaking song come from? It came from the fiery hearts of revolutionary soldiers, from the shining teachings of Chairman Mao in their hearts: "Often, favorable conditions and the initiative to recover are produced in the effort of 'holding on a little longer.'" The invincible Mao Zedong Thought—this is the solid foundation for their lofty character and indomitable spirit, like that of the evergreen pine.

    泰山顶上的青松
    海军某部　海文
    在困难和艰险面前采取什么态度：是迎上去战胜它，还是妥协，逃跑；是把它当作走向胜利的必然阶梯，还是把它当作不可逾越的鸿沟；是把同它战斗当作革命者的最大乐趣，还是把它当作最大的痛苦和折磨——这是区别革命战士和机会主义者的试金石。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队，便是迎着困难前进，把困难踏在脚下，把它当作走向胜利的必然阶梯，把同它的战斗当作最大乐趣的人。
    《沙家浜》里以指导员郭建光为首的十八位新四军伤病员，就是这样的战士。他们在敌人突然扫荡的情况下，转移到沙家浜芦苇荡里。他们身上带着伤，失去了和群众的联系，失去了和上级的联系，断绝了粮食，断绝了医药，头上是寒风冷雨，脚下是凉水污泥……。在这样的困难和艰险面前，他们采取的是什么态度呢？请看：郭建光镇定自若，成竹在胸，他“远望着沙家浜云遮雾障”，没有半点忧愁的情绪，而是满怀豪情地唱道：“要沉着冷静坚守在芦荡，寻找药品解决粮荒，发动群众把办法想，大江南自有天然粮仓”！十八个战士没有叫过半声苦，没有叹过半口气，而是生气勃勃，斗志昂扬，“团结在一起心向党”，“坚如磐石，百炼成钢。”
    “要学那泰山顶上一青松，挺然屹立傲苍穹。八千里风暴吹不倒，九千个雷霆也难轰。烈日喷炎晒不死，严寒霜雪郁郁葱葱……”。这就是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士在困难和艰险面前的英雄气概。
    这十八个新四军战士的歌声，从沙家浜的芦苇荡里冲天而起，化作滚滚的春雷，震撼着九重霄汉！这十八个钢铁战士震天动地的歌声，比十八万门大炮还要响亮，比十八万里的海涛还要高昂！
    这惊天动地的歌声来自哪里？来自革命战士火红的心，来自他们心中闪闪发光的毛主席的教导：“往往有这种情形，有利的情况和主动的恢复，产生于‘再坚持一下’的努力之中。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想——这就是他们象青松一样的崇高品德和倔强性格的坚实依据。
