Edition: 6

	The Mexican Marxist-Leninist Movement recently compiled and published Chairman Mao's quotations on the youth movement. The book collects more than 30 quotations by Chairman Mao on the youth movement. The cover of the book features a portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people. The publisher wrote a preface for this book of quotations, calling on Mexican youth to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, and to follow the path of integrating with the workers and peasants.

	The preface states: The current student movement in Mexico has had a nationwide impact. The student movement, which advocates for democracy and freedom, has shaken the entire society. This is the most important student movement in Mexican history, and it will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the development of the democratic revolution in our country in the future.

	The preface continues: However, "relying solely on the student movement cannot transform society and achieve genuine democracy and freedom. Only by uniting with the broad masses of workers and peasants can significant victories be achieved." The preface points out that the Mexican people must carry out a new democratic revolution. In this revolution, "only through armed struggle and people's war can our people achieve liberation."

	The preface also states that Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism and the most advanced theory of the world revolution today. If revolutionary youth unite with workers, peasants, and other laborers, and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's mass line, establishing a genuine, complete, and selfless proletarian worldview of serving the people, the student movement will develop even further.

    墨西哥马克思列宁主义运动
    出版毛主席关于青年运动语录
    号召青年活学活用毛泽东思想，走同工农群众相结合的道路
    新华社十八日讯　墨西哥城消息：墨西哥马克思列宁主义运动最近选编出版了毛主席关于青年运动的语录。这本书收集了毛主席的三十多条有关青年运动的语录，书的封面印有中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席像。出版者为这本语录写了前言，号召墨西哥青年活学活用毛泽东思想，走同工农群众相结合的道路。
    前言说：墨西哥目前展开的学生运动，其影响波及到全国人民。学生运动高举争取民主自由的斗争旗帜，震动了整个社会。这是墨西哥历史上最重要的一次学生运动，它必将在我国今后民主革命发展中产生巨大的影响。
    前言接着说：但是，“单靠学生运动是改造不了社会并取得真正的民主自由的，只有和广大工农群众结合起来，才能取得重大的胜利。”前言指出，墨西哥人民必须开展新民主主义革命，在这一革命中，“只有通过武装斗争，通过人民战争，我国人民才能获得解放。”
    前言指出，毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义，是当代世界革命最先进的理论。如果革命青年同工农群众和其他劳动者结合起来，活学活用毛主席的群众路线，树立真正的、完全的和大公无私的为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，学生运动必将更深入地发展下去。（附图片）
