The Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Lawyer Nguyen Huu Tho, sent a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the occasion of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	Beijing,
	Chairman Mao Zedong,
	Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
	Government of the People's Republic of China:

	On the occasion of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I, on behalf of the people of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and in my personal capacity, extend our fraternal greetings and warmest congratulations to Chairman Mao, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the entire fraternal Chinese people.

	Nineteen years ago, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the esteemed Chairman Mao Zedong, the heroic Chinese people achieved a revolutionary victory, establishing the great People's Republic of China. This event brought about a fundamental change in the balance of world forces in favor of the world revolutionary movement, making a tremendous contribution to the cause of liberation for oppressed nations.

	Since liberation, the fraternal Chinese people, with their indomitable spirit and self-reliance, have struggled heroically and, in a short period, transformed China from a poor and backward country into a socialist power with a developed industry and agriculture, modern defense, and continuously improving material and cultural life. In particular, the successful testing of China's atomic and hydrogen bombs has brought joy and confidence to the progressive people of the world, causing the enemy to panic and enhancing China's international standing and prestige.

	From the day of its birth, the People's Republic of China has consistently set an example of steadfastly and thoroughly opposing imperialism, old and new colonialism, and wholeheartedly supporting and aiding the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations. The people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front have continuously received strong support and immense, effective assistance from the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the 700 million fraternal Chinese people in our struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. This great support has strengthened and is strengthening the forces of the South Vietnamese people, greatly inspiring and mobilizing the South Vietnamese military and people to resolutely defeat the U.S. aggressors, liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country. The people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front deeply appreciate the sincere and invaluable assistance provided by Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people. We wish to forever consolidate and develop the close, unbreakable, and precious friendship and combat unity between the people of South Vietnam and China.

	On this occasion, the people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front sincerely congratulate the fraternal Chinese people on their great achievements in building socialism and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	We sincerely wish the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the esteemed Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese government, even greater success in building a strong, prosperous, and happy nation, in the cause of liberating Taiwan, and in contributing more to the struggle of the world's people for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress, as well as in the fight against imperialism and colonialism led by the United States.

	May the lofty combat friendship and unity between the people of South Vietnam and the fraternal Chinese people last forever.

	Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam,
	Lawyer Nguyen Huu Tho
	September 28, 1968, South Vietnam

    中国的支援鼓舞了南越军民打败美帝的决心
    新华社三十日讯　毛泽东主席、中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国政府，收到了越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿律师发来的祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年的电报，全文如下：北京毛泽东主席，中国共产党中央委员会，中华人民共和国政府：
    值此中华人民共和国成立十九周年之际，我谨代表越南南方人民，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会并以我个人的名义向毛主席、中国共产党中央委员会、中华人民共和国政府和全体兄弟中国人民致以团结战斗的敬礼和最热烈的祝贺。
    十九年前，在以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，英雄的中国人民取得了革命的胜利，成立了伟大的中华人民共和国，使得世界力量对比发生了完全有利于世界革命运动的变化，为被压迫民族的解放事业，做出了极其巨大的贡献。
    解放后，兄弟的中国人民发挥了不屈不挠的传统和自力更生、奋发图强的精神，英勇奋斗，仅在一个短暂的时期内，就把贫穷落后的中国变成了一个工农业发达的、具有现代国防和物质、文化生活不断得到提高的社会主义强国。特别是中国的原子武器与氢武器的试验成功，使得世界上的进步人民欢欣鼓舞，充满信心，使得敌人恐慌不安，提高了中国在国际上的地位和威望。
    从诞生的那一天起，中华人民共和国一贯树立了坚持不懈地、彻底地反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和全心全意支持与援助被压迫民族革命事业的榜样。越南南方人民和民族解放阵线在自己的抗美救国事业中，不断得到中国共产党、中国政府和七亿兄弟中国人民的有力支持和极其巨大而有效的援助，这种巨大的支援已经和正在加强越南南方人民的力量，大大地鼓舞和动员了越南南方军民彻底打败美国侵略者、解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的决心。越南南方人民和民族解放阵线深切感谢毛主席、中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和人民所给予的真诚的、无比宝贵的援助，我们愿永远巩固和发展越南南方和中国人民之间亲密无间的、牢不可破的珍贵友谊和战斗团结。
    趁此机会，越南南方人民和民族解放阵线衷心祝贺兄弟中国人民在建设社会主义和无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的巨大胜利。
    衷心祝愿中国人民在以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党和中国政府的领导下，在建设强大、繁荣昌盛、幸福的国家事业中，在解放台湾的事业中，取得更辉煌的成就，并对世界人民为争取民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步，以及反对以美国为首的帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争，作出更大的贡献。
    祝越南南方人民和兄弟中国人民之间崇高的战斗的友谊和团结万古长青。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席　阮友寿律师
                          一九六八年九月二十八日于越南南方
