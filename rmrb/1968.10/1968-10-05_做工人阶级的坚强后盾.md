On the joyous occasion of celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, the railway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was successfully opened to traffic. Gazing at the towering steel arch that stands majestically over the surging river, the towering image of the working class appears before our eyes.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail; with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." In our work of supporting the left, we have relied on the leadership of the working class and achieved one victory after another. When we first arrived at the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, due to the instigation of capitalist roaders and class enemies, the two revolutionary factions were at odds. We then established Mao Zedong Thought study classes to promote revolutionary unity. The working class is the most loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao and executes his directives with the utmost resolve. Under the leadership of representatives elected by the workers, the study classes became increasingly effective. Through study, the revolutionary masses quickly raised their consciousness, voluntarily exposed their private thoughts and engaged in self-criticism, and their hostile attitudes quickly dissipated. They reached an agreement on revolutionary unity in the study classes.

Not long after we took on the task of supporting the left at the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, some bourgeois intellectuals spread the reactionary ideas of the "expert line" and "technology first" in front of us, boasting of their bourgeois technical "authority." However, under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao's directive, "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish," we recognized that our working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has undergone long-term tempering through the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. They have the highest political consciousness, are the most resolute in revolution, are the most combat-ready, the wisest, and the most talented. Those bourgeois technical "authorities" are reactionary in politics, decadent in thought, and their technology is a paper tiger. We firmly support the working class as their strong backbone, supporting the working class in fully playing their leading role. The completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The bridge workers, to express their boundless proletarian love for Chairman Mao, wanted to hang the words "Long Live the Great Leader Chairman Mao" in ten gleaming golden characters on the bridge's steel beams. At the time, the task was urgent and heavy, with each character being eight meters square and weighing over five tons. The bourgeois intellectuals raised various difficulties, but we firmly relied on the worker masses, mobilized them to discuss and design on their own, and resolutely supported the workers' pioneering spirit. As a result, they completed the task, which was originally scheduled to take more than half a month, in just seven days. In our work of supporting the left, we also firmly supported the worker masses in smashing the shackles of old rules and regulations, encouraging the worker masses to innovate boldly. For example, in the past, moving a "gantry crane" required six levels of approval, and then an engineer would draw a diagram for construction according to the diagram, taking dozens of days to disassemble and install. Now, we and the workers study Chairman Mao's latest directives together on site, research and formulate plans together, and in half a month, we moved a "gantry crane" that is over fifty meters high and weighs over a thousand tons.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directives, a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation is rising. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, humbly learn from the working class, and in the Cultural Revolution and all work, fully play the leading role of the working class, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    做工人阶级的坚强后盾
    “临汾旅”驻南京长江大桥工地支左部队全体指战员
    在举国欢庆伟大祖国国庆十九周年的大喜日子里，南京长江大桥铁路桥胜利通车了。仰望巍然屹立在滔滔大江之上的钢铁长虹，工人阶级顶天立地的高大形象展现在人们眼前。
    伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”我们在支左工作中依靠了工人阶级的领导，取得了一个又一个胜利。我们刚进驻南京长江大桥时，由于走资派和阶级敌人的挑动，两派革命群众对立。我们就办起毛泽东思想学习班，促进革命的大联合。工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席最忠，对毛主席的指示执行最坚决。在工人选出的代表的领导下，学习班越办越好。革命群众通过学习很快提高了觉悟，主动亮私斗私，深刻地作自我批评，对立情绪很快消除，在学习班就达成了革命大联合的协议。
    我们到南京长江大桥担任支左任务不久，一些资产阶级知识分子就在我们面前散布“专家路线”“技术第一”的反动思想，炫耀资产阶级技术“权威”。但是，我们在伟大领袖毛主席“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”的指示教育下，认识到用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国工人阶级，经受了长期的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的锻炼，政治觉悟最高，革命最坚决，最有战斗力，最聪明，最有才能，而那些资产阶级技术“权威”在政治上是反动的，思想上是腐朽的，技术上也是纸老虎。我们坚决做工人阶级的坚强后盾，支持工人阶级充分发挥领导作用。南京长江大桥的建成是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，建桥工人为表达无限热爱毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，要在大桥的钢梁上悬挂“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁”十个金光闪闪的大字。当时时间紧迫，任务重，每个字有八米见方，约五吨多重。资产阶级知识分子提出了种种困难，我们坚决依靠工人群众，发动群众自己讨论，自己设计，坚决支持工人们的首创精神，结果以七天时间就完成了原定需要半个多月的任务。我们在支左工作中，还坚决支持工人群众砸烂旧条条框框的束缚，鼓励工人群众大胆革新。例如，过去拆移一个“龙门吊架”要经过六道审批手续，然后由工程师画上图才能按图施工，拆卸安装要花几十天时间。现在，我们和工人一起在现场学习毛主席最新指示，一起研究制定方案，半个月内就把一个高五十多米、重一千多吨的“龙门吊架”搬了“家”。
    在毛主席最新指示的指引下，一个伟大的斗、批、改的高潮正在兴起。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，虚心向工人阶级学习，在文化大革命中和一切工作中充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，认真搞好斗、批、改，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
