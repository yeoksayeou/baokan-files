Premier Zhou Enlai Cables Prince Souphanouvong
Most Heartily Congratulates the 23rd Anniversary of the Lao Revolution

New China News Agency, October 11th - On October 11th, Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China cabled Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, to most heartily congratulate the 23rd anniversary of the Lao Revolution. The full text of the cable is as follows:

	To His Highness Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Xam Neua:

	On the occasion of the 23rd anniversary of the Lao Revolution, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, extend the most hearty congratulations to the Lao people and the Lao Patriotic Front.

	Under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao people have waged a heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism and achieved great victories. The victories of the Lao people, like those of the Vietnamese people, are serious blows to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and a great inspiration to revolutionary people all over the world. Your victories once again prove that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and rely firmly on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated.

	At present, the revolutionary situation in the world is excellent. The U.S. has suffered a crushing defeat in the battlefields of Vietnam and Laos. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's invasion of Czechoslovakia has accelerated the complete bankruptcy of modern revisionism. The criminal acts of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists colluding to divide spheres of influence and re-divide the world have aroused greater resistance from the people of the world, and the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has entered a new historical period.

	The Lao people, with their glorious revolutionary fighting traditions, will, in the new historical period, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, persist in a protracted war, and will certainly achieve greater victories in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Chinese people and the Chinese government, in accordance with the consistent teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, will resolutely support the revolutionary struggle of the Lao people until they achieve final victory.

	Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai
	Beijing, October 11, 1968

    周恩来总理致电苏发努冯亲王
    最热烈祝贺老挝革命节二十三周年
    新华社十一日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来十一日打电报给老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王，最热烈祝贺老挝革命节二十三周年。电报全文如下：桑怒老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王殿下：
    在老挝革命节二十三周年的时候，我代表中国人民、中华人民共和国政府，向老挝人民、老挝爱国战线党致以最热烈的祝贺。
    老挝人民在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，对美帝国主义进行了英勇的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。老挝人民的胜利和越南人民的胜利一样，是对美帝国主义及其走狗的严重打击，是对全世界革命人民的很大鼓舞。你们的胜利再一次证明：国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。
    现在全世界革命形势一片大好。美帝在越南和老挝战场上遭到了惨败。苏修叛徒集团侵略捷克斯洛伐克，加速了现代修正主义的总破产。美帝、苏修相互勾结、妄图划分势力范围、重新瓜分世界的罪恶行径，激起了世界人民更大的反抗，全世界人民反对美帝、苏修的斗争进入了一个新的历史时期。
    有着光荣革命斗争传统的老挝人民，在新的历史时期中，发扬彻底革命精神，坚持持久战争，必将赢得抗美救国斗争的更大胜利。中国人民、中国政府本着伟大领袖毛主席的一贯教导，将坚决支持老挝人民的革命斗争，直到取得最后的胜利。
                    中华人民共和国国务院总理  周恩来
                             一九六八年十月十一日于北京
