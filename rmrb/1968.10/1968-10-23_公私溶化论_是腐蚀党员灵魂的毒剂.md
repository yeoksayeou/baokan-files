A communist party member should have what kind of worldview?

In a speech, the Chinese Khrushchev proudly declared: "Under the conditions of socialism, those who focus solely on personal interests will not achieve personal interests. Those who wholeheartedly serve the people will have personal interests. 'Benefits are in the future,' this is a matter of worldview."

"Benefits are in the future," these five simple words vividly depict the corrupt soul of the Chinese Khrushchev, the number one capitalist roader within the party, and his malicious intent to poison communist party members.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In terms of worldview, in modern times, there are basically only two kinds: the worldview of the proletariat and the worldview of the bourgeoisie. Either it is the worldview of the proletariat, or it is the worldview of the bourgeoisie." Every communist party member must have a thorough proletarian worldview.

The core of the proletarian worldview is to "wholeheartedly serve the people," to "be selfless and serve others," it is all about the "public." The core of the bourgeois worldview is to compete for fame, profit, and power for oneself, it is all about the "private." "Benefits are in the future," its essence is the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the fusion of public and private interests," it is the bourgeois worldview of seeking personal gain.

What are "benefits"? Different classes have different views.

Chairman Mao teaches us to "put the interests of the people first," to be "greatly beneficial to the people." Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the vanguard warriors of the proletariat regard the complete liberation of the Chinese people and all the people of the world, and the realization of the magnificent ideal of communism, as the greatest "benefits"; they regard the arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice for this sublime goal as the greatest joy, the greatest glory, and the greatest happiness. Because of this, the model for supporting the left and loving the people, Comrade Li Wenzhong, in the surging waters of the Gan River, risked his life to rescue the Red Guards. In his last moments, he thought of Chairman Mao, of Chairman Mao's Red Guards, and uttered the resounding and heroic oath, "Don't worry about me."

What are the so-called "benefits" that the Chinese Khrushchev talks about? They are "personal interests," that is, the things he has been pursuing all his life, the things he loves to talk about, such as "a life of wealth and honor," "standing out," "being one of the top two in China," and so on. In short, it is about personal fame, profit, and power. This is clearly a replica of the life philosophy of the exploiting class, "If one does not seek personal gain, one will be punished by heaven and earth," where is there a trace of proletarian thought!

However, the Chinese Khrushchev sometimes pretends to talk about "serving the people." Why does the Chinese Khrushchev, who is wholeheartedly seeking personal "benefits," talk so much about "serving the people"? He answers: "Wholeheartedly serving the people will result in personal interests." In one sentence, he reveals the truth, originally serving the public is false, serving the private is true, "serving the people" is a means, seizing "personal interests" is the goal. Isn't this just like a speculator hanging up a "big discount sale" sign to cheat the most profit? A thin layer of gauze woven from the words "serving the people" can never cover up the stench of the Chinese Khrushchev's black heart!

Why does the Chinese Khrushchev put personal interests "in the future"? He says: "Under the conditions of socialism, those who focus solely on personal interests will not achieve personal interests." Again, he reveals the truth, originally putting it "in the front" is too obvious, it won't work, it must be put "in the future" to work. This is no different from the cunning and evil landlord, who, in order to consolidate his exploitation of the peasants to the bone, pretends to be "kind" and does some "bridge-building" and "road-paving" tricks. The Chinese Khrushchev stands on the bourgeois standpoint, for himself, deceiving the party and the people. No matter how he disguises himself, he cannot cover up his extremely selfish true face. Putting the private "in the front" is for the individual, putting the private "in the future" is also for the individual, and it is even more despicable and sinister.

"Benefits are in the future," this is genuine bourgeois worldview, this is the genuine counter-revolutionary trick of a personal ambitionist!

The Chinese Khrushchev and a small group of stubborn capitalist roaders, with him as their backer, are all black ghosts whose souls are soaked in this rotten bourgeois worldview. Their entire history is the history of two-faced people, traitors, and ambitious people. They may deceive people for a while with their false appearance, but in the end, they will be spat on by hundreds of millions of people and crushed by the wheels of history!

We, the broad masses of communist party members, follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, take "wholeheartedly serving the people" as our sole purpose, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, highlight proletarian politics, and stride forward on the path of thought revolutionization. Under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, countless Lei Fengs, Wang Jies, Mai Xiandeis, and Li Wenzhongs have emerged. They give their hearts to the people and the revolution, in their hearts, there is only Chairman Mao and the communist cause, and there is no room for themselves. Compared to them, the Chinese Khrushchev is so small, so despicable, so filthy!

"The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." The socialist revolution is to overthrow all private ownership, to overthrow all ideological systems of the exploiting class. Without thoroughly transforming the bourgeois worldview, one cannot truly become a proletarian revolutionary who is determined to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, thoroughly purge all the poison and influence of the Chinese Khrushchev, work hard on transforming the worldview, replace the "private" with the "public," follow Chairman Mao to make a revolution for life, and become a genuine, vigorous communist warrior.

    “公私溶化论”是腐蚀党员灵魂的毒剂
    第二炮兵　齐立公
    一个共产党员应该具有什么样的世界观？
    中国赫鲁晓夫在一次讲话中洋洋得意地说：“在社会主义的条件下，一心一意搞个人利益的人是搞不到个人利益的。一心一意为人民服务反而会有个人利益”。“好处在后头，这是世界观问题。”
    “好处在后头”，寥寥五个字，活生生地画出中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内头号走资派的腐朽灵魂，以及他毒害共产党员的险恶居心。
    毛主席教导我们：“就世界观来说，在现代，基本上只有两家，就是无产阶级一家，资产阶级一家。或者是无产阶级的世界观，或者是资产阶级的世界观。”我们每个共产党员都必须具有彻底的无产阶级世界观。
    无产阶级世界观的核心，就是“全心全意地为人民服务”，“毫不利己专门利人”，就是一个“公”字。资产阶级世界观的核心，就是为个人争名、争利、争权，就是一个“私”字。“好处在后头”，它的实质就是中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化论”，是一心为私的资产阶级世界观。
    什么是“好处”？不同的阶级有不同的看法。
    毛主席教导我们，要“一切从人民的利益出发”，做“大有利于人民的人”。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级先锋战士，把中国人民和全世界人民的彻底解放、实现共产主义的宏伟理想，看作是最大的“好处”；把为达到这一崇高的目的而艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲，看作是最大的快乐，最大的光荣，最大的幸福。正因为这样，支左爱民模范李文忠同志，在滔滔的赣江激流中，舍生忘死，抢救红卫兵小将。他在生命的最后一刻，想到的是毛主席，是毛主席的红卫兵，发出的是“不要管我”这一响亮的豪迈誓言。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这里说的所谓“好处”是什么？是“个人利益”，也就是他一生中孜孜以求、津津乐道的什么“一生富贵”、“出人头地”、在中国“数一数二”等等。总之是个人的名、利、权。这分明是剥削阶级“人不为己，天诛地灭”的人生哲学的翻版，哪里有一丝一毫无产阶级思想的气味！
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫有时也装模作样地谈谈“为人民服务”。一心一意要捞取个人“好处”的中国赫鲁晓夫为什么要大谈其“为人民服务”呢？他回答说：“一心一意为人民服务反而会有个人利益”。一语道破其中底细，原来为公是假，为私是真，“为人民服务”是手段，攫取“个人利益”才是目的。这不正是投机商挂起“减价大拍卖”的广告来骗取最大利润的那套手段么？薄薄的一层用“为人民服务”的词句织成的纱布，绝遮不住中国赫鲁晓夫臭气熏天的黑心！
    中国赫鲁晓夫为什么又把个人利益放在“后头”呢？他说：“在社会主义的条件下，一心一意搞个人利益的人是搞不到个人利益的。”又是一语道破其中底细，原来放在“前头”太露骨了，搞不到，须得放在“后头”，才搞得到。这和狡猾凶恶的地主为了巩固他对农民敲骨吸髓的剥削，而伪装“善良”，搞些“修桥”、“铺路”的鬼把戏，有什么两样？中国赫鲁晓夫站在资产阶级立场，为的是自己，欺骗的是党和人民。但是不管怎样乔装打扮，也掩盖不了他的极端利己主义的真面目。把私字放在“前头”是为个人，把私字放在“后头”也是为个人，而且更卑鄙，更阴险。
    “好处在后头”，这是货真价实的资产阶级世界观，这是地地道道的个人野心家的反革命权术！
    中国赫鲁晓夫和以他为总后台的一小撮顽固不化的走资本主义道路的当权派，一个个都是为这种腐烂透顶的资产阶级世界观浸透了灵魂的黑鬼。他们的全部历史，就是两面派、叛徒、野心家的历史。他们可能以假相骗人于一时，但最后必将为亿万人民所唾弃，为历史的车轮所碾碎！
    我们广大共产党员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把“全心全意地为人民服务”作为唯一的宗旨，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，在思想革命化的大道上阔步前进。在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，涌现出成千成万雷锋、王杰、麦贤得、李文忠式的共产主义战士。他们掏尽红心为人民，为革命，心中只有毛主席，只有共产主义事业，唯独没有自己。比起他们来，中国赫鲁晓夫是多么渺小，多么卑鄙，多么肮脏！
    “世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。社会主义革命就是要革一切私有制的命，要革一切剥削阶级意识形态的命。不彻底改造资产阶级世界观，就不能真正成为“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的一切流毒和影响，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，把“私”字换成“公”字，跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命，做一个名副其实的朝气蓬勃的共产主义战士。（附图片）
