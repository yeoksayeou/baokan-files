The wheels roll, the locomotive roars, and the forty-third express train from the capital Beijing to Lanzhou is speeding forward.

In car number five, the train attendant Xiaohu, along with the on-duty soldiers, organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for the passengers. In the class, many passengers closely linked Chairman Mao's great teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production" and shared their experiences in seizing the revolution and vigorously promoting production. Speeches followed one after another. The study session was quite lively!

Xiaohu noticed a young man in his twenties sitting there with a heavy heart, head down, and not saying a word. After some investigation, it was discovered that he was a young intellectual who had gone to the countryside. Due to the influence of the revisionist educational line and the bourgeois ideology spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "study to become an official" and "gain fame and fortune" theories, along with the incitement of a handful of class enemies, he was unwilling to work in the countryside. He thought the environment was harsh, with many mosquitoes and strong winds, not a place where intellectuals should live. Therefore, he left the countryside and returned to Beijing.

The comrades in the train study class learned about this and unanimously agreed that they should help this young man correct his understanding, so that he could return to his work post and follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as guided by Chairman Mao. They studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on intellectuals integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers together with him. Many old workers patiently criticized and helped him. An old worker said, "In the old society, the poor were exploited and couldn't even go to school. Today, you have such good conditions to study and even graduated from middle school, but you don't want to serve the workers and peasants in a harsh environment and only want to live a comfortable life in the city. This is a dead end, a revisionist path, and it must not be followed." A poor peasant woman also said, "We farmers grow grain to feed you with fine rice and white flour. After you graduate, you don't want to go to the countryside to farm. Isn't this being ungrateful?"

The heartfelt words of the old workers and poor peasants touched the young man's heart and deeply educated him. He could no longer sit still, tearfully made a sincere self-criticism. Then, he clenched his fist and shouted the slogan "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" He angrily denounced the revisionist educational line's heinous crimes of poisoning the youth. He firmly declared that he would return to the farm, humbly learn from the workers and peasants, seriously reform his thoughts, and resolutely follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as guided by Chairman Mao.

His attitude of humbly accepting criticism and sincerely correcting his mistakes was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary passengers. Immediately, cheers of "Warmly welcome the integration of intellectual youth with workers, peasants, and soldiers!" and "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" echoed throughout the car.

    列车上的学习班
    车轮滚滚，机车隆隆，由祖国的首都北京开往兰州的第四十三次直快列车，正在急速地向前奔驰。
  五号车厢的列车员小胡和值勤部队的解放军同志一起，组织乘车的旅客办起了列车毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，很多旅客紧密结合伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，争着谈起了本单位狠抓革命、猛促生产的体会。发言一个紧接一个。学习会开的蛮生动哩！
    列车员小胡看到一位二十来岁的青年，心事重重，低着头一言不发地坐在那里。经过了解，才知道他是一个上山下乡的知识青年。由于受修正主义教育路线的影响，受中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的“读书做官”论、“成名成家”论的资产阶级思想的腐蚀，再加上一小撮阶级敌人的煽动，他不安心在农村劳动，认为那里环境艰苦，蚊虫多，风沙大，不是知识青年应该住的地方。于是，他便离开农村回北京来了。
    列车学习班的同志知道了这件事，大家一致认为：应该帮助这个青年端正认识，使他能回到工作岗位上去，走毛主席指引的知识分子和工农兵相结合的道路。大家和他一起反复学习了毛主席关于知识分子要走与工农兵相结合的道路的伟大教导，很多老工人都耐心地对他进行了批评和帮助。一位老工人说：“在旧社会，穷人受剥削，根本上不起学。今天，你有这样好的条件学习，能读到中学毕业，却不愿在艰苦的环境里为工农服务，只想在城市里过舒适的生活，这是一条死胡同，是修正主义的道路，万万走不得。”一位贫农大妈也说：“我们种地打下粮食，用细米白面养活着你们，你们毕业了，反而不想到乡下种田，这不是忘本吗？”
    老工人和贫下中农语重心长的话，打动了这个青年的心，使他受到深刻的教育。他再也坐不住了，含着眼泪作了诚恳的自我批评。接着，他紧握拳头高呼“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”的口号，愤怒控诉了修正主义教育路线毒害青年的滔天罪行。他坚决表示，要回到农场去，虚心向工农学习，认真改造思想，坚定地走毛主席指引的与工农兵相结合的道路。
    他这种虚心接受批评，诚恳改正错误的态度，受到了广大革命旅客的热烈欢迎。顿时，“热烈欢迎知识青年与工农兵相结合！”“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”的欢呼声响彻整个车厢。
