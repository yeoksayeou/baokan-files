Shanghai Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams Enter Middle and Primary Schools

Putting the Implementation of Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions in the Most Important Position

After the Shanghai Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams entered middle and primary schools, they organized various types of study classes and conducted thorough and detailed political and ideological work. The educational revolution in schools quickly opened up a lively and vibrant new situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 12 – The workers' propaganda teams that entered various middle and primary schools in Shanghai have swiftly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, quickly opening up a lively and vibrant new situation for the educational revolution in these schools.

After the workers' propaganda teams entered the middle and primary schools, they placed the study, publicity, and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the most important position. Under the leadership of the workers' propaganda teams and with the cooperation of the People's Liberation Army, all schools have universally set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They organized the Red Guards and the broad revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works and his series of latest instructions, as well as Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything." This greatly heightened the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The young revolutionaries used Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to examine themselves, consciously engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and truly achieved revolutionary unity in their thoughts.

The broad workers in the propaganda teams entering the middle and primary schools followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles." They actively conducted heart-to-heart talks among the teachers and students, doing thorough and detailed ideological work. During these talks, many veteran workers shared their bitter family histories with the revolutionary teachers and students, arousing their proletarian sentiments. Many veteran workers also used various opportunities to have individual heart-to-heart talks with the revolutionary teachers and students. They seriously and warmly criticized some teachers and students for their anarchist tendencies and bourgeois factionalism, deeply educating the revolutionary teachers and students. In some schools where the "class struggle, criticism, and transformation" was relatively successful, the workers' propaganda teams also paid attention to the problems they faced, conducting thorough and detailed political and ideological work, helping them to carry out the revolution even better.

Some workers' propaganda teams entering the middle and primary schools also organized revolutionary teachers and students to visit factories, introducing how workers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and how they follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. This helped the revolutionary teachers and students find their shortcomings, and they all expressed their willingness to accept re-education from the working class and to achieve new successes in completing the great historical task of "class struggle, criticism, and transformation."

Following Chairman Mao's instruction, "Never forget class struggle," the workers' propaganda teams entering some "difficult" units organized study classes, focused on class struggle, and promoted revolutionary unity in the schools. A middle school in Changning District had long been plagued by internal strife, and many study classes had been held, but the cover on class struggle could not be lifted. After the workers' propaganda teams entered the school, they fully mobilized the masses, focused on class struggle, and helped the revolutionary teachers and students quickly expose the black hands who had long been instigating armed struggles between the two factions from behind the scenes. They swept away evil winds and bad habits, greatly arousing the enthusiasm of the revolutionary teachers and students, and the school's appearance was completely transformed.

Similar "difficult" units exist in Jing'an District, Luwan District, Huangpu District, and Yangpu District. Under the leadership of the workers' propaganda teams, the masses were mobilized to carry out struggles against the enemy, quickly changing the situation.

Now, all middle and primary schools in the city present a vibrant revolutionary scene. Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the orders of the proletarian headquarters are being swiftly and smoothly implemented, becoming the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary teachers and students. The mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works has reached a new high, and the great criticism of the bourgeoisie is being widely and deeply carried out. The broad revolutionary teachers and students joyfully say, "The workers' propaganda teams are truly our good teachers. We must, under the leadership of the working class, carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end!"

    上海工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻中小学
    把落实毛主席最新指示放在最重要地位
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻中小学后，大办各种类型的学习班，做好深入细致的政治思想工作，学校教育革命迅速打开生动活泼新局面
    新华社上海十二日电　上海进驻各中、小学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，雷厉风行地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，为这些学校的教育革命迅速打开了生动活泼的新局面。
    工人宣传队进驻中、小学以后，把学习、宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示放在最重要的地位。在工人宣传队的领导下，在解放军的配合下，各个学校都普遍办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织红卫兵小将和广大革命师生学习毛主席的光辉著作和一系列最新指示，学习姚文元同志的重要文章《工人阶级必须领导一切》，大大提高了阶级斗争的觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟。小将们用毛主席的一系列最新指示对照自己，自觉地斗私批修，真正从思想上实现了革命大联合。
    进驻中、小学的广大工人宣传队员，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，在师生中大力开展谈心活动，做深入细致的思想工作。在谈心过程中，许多老工人都向革命师生倾诉自己的苦难家史，激发革命师生的无产阶级的感情。许多老工人利用各种机会和革命师生个别谈心。他们对有些师生的无政府主义、资产阶级派性等缺点，提出了严肃而热情的批评，使革命师生受到深刻教育。有些复课闹革命搞得比较好的学校，工人宣传队也注意针对他们存在的问题，进行深入细致的政治思想工作，帮助他们把革命搞得更好。
    有些进入中小学的工人宣传队还组织革命师生到工厂参观，介绍工人是如何无限忠于毛主席，如何紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的，使革命师生找到了差距，纷纷表示要接受工人阶级再教育，在完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务中立新功。
    遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，工人宣传队进入一些“老大难”单位后，大办学习班，狠抓阶级斗争，促进了学校的革命大联合。长宁区有一所中学过去长期“内战”不休，多次举办学习班，阶级斗争盖子总是揭不开。工人宣传队进校后，充分发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争，帮助革命师生很快揪出了长期躲在幕后挑动两派武斗的黑手，横扫了歪风邪气，大大调动了革命师生的积极性，全校面貌焕然一新。
    静安区、卢湾区、黄浦区、杨浦区都有这样一些“老大难”单位，在工人宣传队的领导下，发动群众开展对敌斗争，很快改变了面貌。
    现在，全市各个中、小学呈现一派生气勃勃的革命景象。毛主席的最新指示，无产阶级司令部的号令，正在迅速畅通无阻地贯彻执行，变成广大革命师生的自觉行动。学习毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新的高潮，革命大批判广泛深入地开展。广大革命师生欢欣鼓舞地说，工人宣传队真是我们的好老师，我们一定要在工人阶级领导下，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
