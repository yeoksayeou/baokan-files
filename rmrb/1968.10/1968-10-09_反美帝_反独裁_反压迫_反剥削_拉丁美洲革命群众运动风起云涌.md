In the "backyard" of U.S. imperialism, Latin America, revolutionary mass movements, particularly student movements, are flourishing. Broad masses of workers, peasants, and students have launched extensive struggles against U.S. imperialism, dictatorship, oppression, and exploitation. This indicates the awakening of the Latin American people and marks a new surge in mass struggles in Latin America.

Starting from April this year, under the rule of the pro-U.S. military dictatorship in Brazil, students first launched a massive struggle against U.S. cultural aggression, military dictatorship, and the demand for reforming the corrupt educational system. Subsequently, in countries like Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and relatively "quiet" Mexico, as well as more than ten other countries, workers, peasants, and students have continuously held large-scale strikes, boycotts, and demonstrations, sparking a new wave of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents. The development of this struggle has been extremely rapid, with each wave higher than the last. In some countries, the struggle has spread from major cities to medium and small cities, from the capital to the interior, and from individual struggles of students, workers, and peasants to mass movements involving tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people from various strata. The scale, duration, and intensity of the struggle are unprecedented in recent years. This has caused great alarm among U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces in various countries.

The Struggle Targets the U.S. and Its Local Agents

The struggle launched by the revolutionary masses in Latin America is primarily directed against the number one enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its agents in the country. This shows that the political awareness of the Latin American people is steadily increasing. In April, June, and August this year, large-scale anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship struggles broke out in almost all 22 states of Brazil, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its agents in Brazil. Brazilian students clearly stated in their struggle: "Our goal is to overthrow the military dictatorship that oppresses us and destroy U.S. imperialism." Argentine workers also raised the battle cry of "No to being a colony!" and "Down with the Yankees!" during their struggle. In mid-August this year, the people of Uruguay broke through the usual scope of economic struggles in their demonstrations, shouting slogans against U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces in their own country, and even smashed the buildings of the U.S. "Pan American Airlines" and "General Electric Company" in the area. Chilean peasants demanded the return of land seized by large landowners, both domestic and foreign, especially American. In Ecuador, farmers in Los Rios province held a meeting in May, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism as the culprit behind the poverty and hunger of the Ecuadorian people. In El Salvador, a country in Central America long under strict U.S. control, when U.S. President Johnson arrived in the country in early July to engage in conspiracy activities, students bravely broke through the tight security of the military police, shouting "Johnson get out!" "Yankees go home!" and throwing eggs, tomatoes, and paint bottles at the car carrying Johnson.

Fighting Back Against the Enemy

Faced with the surging mass movements in Latin America, the ruling cliques in various Latin American countries, following the instructions of U.S. imperialism, have intensified their use of both military suppression and political deception, attempting to extinguish the flames of the burgeoning mass struggles. They have continuously carried out suppression activities, universally abolished so-called "constitutional guarantees," issued "martial law," banned marches, rallies, and demonstrations, and arrested revolutionary masses en masse. They have also used U.S.-trained specialized organizations such as "riot control units" and "mobile groups" to suppress the people, and even brazenly deployed land, sea, and air forces, using helicopters, tanks, rocket launchers, and other weapons to carry out bloody suppression. However, the reactionaries' violent suppression has not intimidated the revolutionary people of Latin America; instead, it has further fueled their hatred for the reactionaries. Brazilian students raised a resounding slogan in their struggle: "Only by responding to violence with violence can we win the anti-imperialist struggle!" In their struggle against the enemy, the revolutionary masses of Latin America fearlessly use stones, sticks, glass bottles, homemade incendiary bombs, and other weapons to engage in fierce battles with the reactionary military police, waging a struggle of equals. They have also seen through the reactionaries' political deception and exposed their schemes to disintegrate and sabotage the mass struggles. In Brazil, where the student movement has been the most intense and lasted the longest, when the reactionary authorities attempted to use the appointment of a so-called "educational reform working group" to "dialogue" with the students, the revolutionary students saw through its deceptive nature and resolutely refused to "dialogue" with the "working group"; at the same time, they publicly called on students to "take to the streets to resist suppression." More and more revolutionary masses in Latin America have seen through the traitorous faces of revisionists colluding with the reactionaries to sabotage the mass movements and have broken through their various controls and obstructions, persevering in their struggles.

The Significance of Student, Worker, and Peasant Struggles

A significant feature of the people's struggles in Latin America is the emergence of mutual support and cooperation among students, workers, and peasants. This is an important indicator of the deepening of mass movements in Latin America today.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "To make the student movement lasting, to break through the martial law imposed by the traitors, the police, spies, hooligans, and fascist slaughter policies, it is only possible to combine with the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers." More and more revolutionary people in Latin America have gradually understood this truth through their struggles. In Brazil, 100,000 workers in the largest industrial city of São Paulo held a march and demonstration to support the students' struggle. Students also firmly supported the struggle of the broad masses of metallurgical workers in the Osasco industrial zone of São Paulo city for wage increases and the revolutionary action of occupying factories. In January, workers of the U.S.-owned "Jones" construction company in Bolivia went on strike and received firm support from students at the University of Cochabamba. Cochabamba University students decided to send a group of students to the road construction site to expose U.S. imperialism's economic plunder in Bolivia together with the road construction workers. In July, when farmers in the "Santa Ana" estate in Loja province, Ecuador, rose up to seize land and were massacred, students in Loja province immediately shouted slogans such as "Punish the butchers who massacre the people!" and held a massive demonstration to support the farmers, and also attacked the local reactionary agencies and the U.S. imperialist invasion organization "Peace Corps" office with stones. In the Chilean capital Santiago, the important port of Valparaíso, and the southern province of Ñuble, students, workers, and peasants all held meetings, demonstrations, and strikes in early August to strongly protest the government's bloody suppression of farmers in the "San Miguel" estate in Aconcagua province. The students' slogan was: "We will fight alongside the peasants!" In Córdoba, Argentina, when striking workers were persecuted, local university students joined the workers in bravely counterattacking the police's savage assault.

The flourishing of revolutionary mass movements in Latin America is the inevitable result of the worsening economic situation in various Latin American countries under the impact of the political and economic crises of the capitalist world, and the further intensification of national contradictions and class contradictions within the country. The ruling position of U.S. imperialism in its "backyard" of Latin America is increasingly unstable. No matter how U.S. imperialism and its lackeys carry out violent suppression and political deception, they will never be able to stop the surging tide of the people's struggles in Latin America. The people of Latin America will certainly launch more fierce attacks on U.S. imperialism and its agents and spark a new storm of mass struggles.

    反美帝　反独裁　反压迫　反剥削
    拉丁美洲革命群众运动风起云涌
    在美帝国主义的“后院”拉丁美洲，革命群众运动，特别是学生运动，正在蓬勃发展。广大工人、农民、学生广泛开展了反美、反独裁、反压迫、反剥削的群众性斗争。这表明了拉丁美洲人民的新觉醒，标志着拉丁美洲群众斗争的新高涨。
    从今年四月开始，在亲美军事独裁政权统治下的巴西，学生们首先展开了反对美国文化侵略、反对军事独裁统治和要求改革腐朽教育制度的声势浩大的群众斗争。接着，智利、阿根廷、乌拉圭以及一向比较“平静”的墨西哥等十多个国家的工人、农民、学生不断举行规模巨大的罢工、罢课、示威游行，掀起了一个反对美帝国主义及其代理人的斗争的新浪潮。这一斗争的发展极为迅猛，一浪高过一浪。在一些国家中，斗争浪潮从大城市波及到中小城市，从首都扩展到内地，从单一的学生、工人、农民斗争，发展到有各阶层人士数万人至数十万人参加的群众运动。斗争的规模、持续的时间、激烈的程度，是近年来所未有的。这使美帝国主义和各国反动派惊恐万状。
    矛头指向美帝及其本国代理人
    拉丁美洲革命群众掀起的这场斗争，其总矛头是指向头号敌人美帝国主义及其在本国的代理人，这表明拉丁美洲人民的政治觉悟正在日益提高。今年四月、六月、八月间，几乎在全巴西二十二个州都相继发生了大规模的反美反独裁斗争，沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其在巴西的代理人。巴西学生在斗争中明确指出：“我们的目标是推翻压迫我们的军事独裁统治和摧毁美帝国主义”。阿根廷的工人在斗争中也提出了“不要当殖民地！”“打倒美国佬！”的战斗口号。乌拉圭群众，在今年八月中旬，突破了往常群众斗争一般是经济斗争的范围，在游行示威中高呼反对美帝、反对本国反动派的口号，并且还砸了美国在当地的“泛美航空公司”和“通用电气公司”的大楼。智利农民要求从本国和外国，特别是美国的大庄园主手里收回被他们霸占的土地。在厄瓜多尔，洛斯里奥斯省的农民在五月间举行集会，强烈谴责美帝国主义是使厄瓜多尔人民贫困和饥饿的罪魁祸首。在美国长期严密控制的中美洲国家萨尔瓦多，当美帝头子约翰逊七月初到这个国家进行阴谋活动时，学生们英勇地冲破了军警的森严戒备，高呼“约翰逊滚蛋！”“美国佬滚回去！”等口号，把鸡蛋、西红柿、油漆瓶狠狠地扔向约翰逊乘坐的汽车。
    同敌人展开针锋相对斗争
    面对拉丁美洲日益高涨的群众运动，拉美各国统治集团，按照美帝国主义的旨意，加紧玩弄武力镇压和政治诱骗的反革命两手，妄图扑灭日益旺盛的群众斗争的火焰。它们不断进行镇压活动，普遍地取消了所谓“宪法保证”，颁布了“戒严令”，禁止游行、集会、示威，大肆逮捕革命群众。它们还使用由美帝国主义精心训练的专门镇压人民的“防暴队”、“机动小组”等反动组织，甚至悍然动用陆、海、空部队，出动直升飞机、坦克、火箭炮等武器，对人民实行血腥镇压。但是，反动派的反革命暴力并没有吓倒拉丁美洲革命人民，相反，更加激发了他们对反动派的无比仇恨。巴西学生在斗争中提出了响亮的口号：“只有用暴力回答暴力才能赢得反帝斗争的胜利！”拉美革命群众在反击敌人的斗争中，不畏强暴，勇敢地用石块、木棍、玻璃瓶、土制燃烧弹等作武器，同前来镇压他们的反动军警进行激烈的搏斗，展开针锋相对的斗争。他们在斗争中还识破了反动派玩弄的进行政治诱骗，企图瓦解、破坏群众斗争的阴谋。在学生运动最为激烈、时间持续最长的巴西，当反动当局企图用任命所谓“教育改革工作小组”同学生举行“对话”时，革命学生就看穿了它的欺骗实质，断然拒绝同“工作小组”“对话”；同时公开号召广大学生“上街对付镇压”。越来越多的拉美革命群众还在斗争中看清了修正主义分子与反动派进行勾结破坏群众运动的叛徒嘴脸，因而，冲破了他们的种种控制和阻挠，坚持斗争。
    学生斗争和工人农民斗争互相配合
    具有重大意义的是，在拉丁美洲的人民群众斗争中，出现了学生、工人和农民相互配合、相互支援的新特点。这是当前拉美群众运动日益深入的一个重要的标志。
    伟大领袖毛主席曾经指出：“学生运动要得到持久性，要冲破卖国贼的戒严令，警察、侦探、学棍、法西斯蒂的破坏和屠杀政策，只有和工人、农民、兵士的斗争配合起来，才有可能。”越来越多的拉丁美洲革命人民从斗争实践中逐步地懂得了这个真理。在巴西，最大的工业城市圣保罗的十万工人举行了游行示威，声援学生的斗争。学生们对圣保罗市奥萨斯科工业区广大冶金工人要求增加工资的斗争和占领工厂的革命行动，也给予了坚决的声援。一月间，玻利维亚美资“琼斯”建筑公司的工人举行罢工，得到了科恰班巴大学生的坚决支持，科恰班巴大学生决定派出一批学生到筑路工地，和筑路工人一起揭露美帝国主义在玻利维亚的经济掠夺活动。七月间，厄瓜多尔洛哈省“圣安娜”庄园农民奋起夺地遭到屠杀时，洛哈省大学生立即高呼“惩办屠杀人民的刽子手！”等口号，举行声势浩大的声援农民的示威，并且用石块袭击了当地的反动机关和美帝国主义侵略机构“和平队”的办事处。在智利首都圣地亚哥和重要港口瓦尔帕莱索以及南部纽夫莱省，学生、工人和农民在八月初都相继举行集会、示威和罢工，强烈抗议当局血腥镇压阿康卡瓜省“圣米格尔”庄园的农民。学生提出的口号是：“我们要同农民共同斗争！”在阿根廷的科尔多瓦，当罢工示威的工人遭到迫害时，当地大学生同工人一起英勇反击了警察的野蛮进攻。
    拉丁美洲革命群众运动的蓬勃发展，是拉美各国在资本主义世界政治、经济危机的冲击下，经济状况显著恶化，民族矛盾和国内阶级矛盾进一步激化的必然结果。美帝国主义在它“后院”拉丁美洲的统治地位日益不稳。不管美帝及其走狗怎样进行暴力镇压，怎样玩弄政治欺骗，都决不能阻挡拉美人民群众斗争的洪流滚滚向前。拉丁美洲人民必将向美帝国主义及其代理人发动更加猛烈的进攻，掀起更大的群众斗争的新风暴。　            （新华社）
