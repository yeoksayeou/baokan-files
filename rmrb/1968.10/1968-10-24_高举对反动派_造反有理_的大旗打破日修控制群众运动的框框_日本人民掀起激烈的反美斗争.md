Japanese People Launch Intense Anti-American Struggles

	Tokyo, October 23 (New China News Agency) — On October 21, the Japanese people launched a massive anti-American struggle, the scale and intensity of which were unprecedented in Japan's mass movements in recent years.

	In Tokyo, the New Host Station, a crucial transfer point for transporting fuel for American military aircraft, became the scene of intense clashes. That night, 30,000 Japanese workers, students, and citizens gathered in front of the station. The area was filled with a sea of red flags and a surging crowd. A mass rally was held in the station square. The demonstrators held up countless red flags, one of which read "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" and fluttered in the wind. The rally echoed with slogans such as "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" and "Remove U.S. Military Bases from Japan!" A student speaker said at the rally: "The revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are heavily striking at American imperialism. Now is the time when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory. The Japanese people's anti-American struggle is an important part of the world revolutionary struggle. Let us take action, strike hard at the Japanese and American reactionaries, use violent struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' and remove U.S. military bases, and liberate Okinawa." He concluded with the call: "Determine to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory. Long live Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!"

	At the same time, a demonstration team composed of workers and students broke through the iron barriers recently erected by the Japanese reactionary authorities and stormed into the New Host Station. They fought hand-to-hand with the fascist police on the platforms and railway tracks, blocking the transport of fuel for American military aircraft. They joined forces with the railway workers and took control of the entire station. The reactionary Sato government ordered fully armed police to brutally suppress the demonstrators. However, the workers and youth, undeterred by the violence, built barricades, threw stones, and bravely fought back against the police, repelling their attacks several times. To punish the Japanese and American reactionaries, the enraged Japanese workers and youth destroyed the train cars and signal lights inside the station, as well as other equipment. Some young students even climbed onto the freight cars, raining down stones on the police from above. They also set fire to the barricades erected by the police. The Japanese police threw a large number of tear gas canisters at the crowd, but the demonstrators, undaunted, continued their struggle and repeatedly repelled the attacks of the armed police, driving them into a state of utter chaos. A police car used for filming inside the station was also destroyed and set on fire by the angry crowd. The demonstrators cheered in victory as they faced the blazing fire. The authorities quickly dispatched fire trucks, but they were blocked by the crowd, and the fire trucks had to stop at a distance, watching helplessly as the police car continued to burn.

	At 00:15 on October 22, the reactionary Sato government ordered the mass arrest of the demonstrators and the crowd that came to support them. However, Sato's government's tactics failed to intimidate the broad masses of the Japanese people who were determined to fight against American imperialism. They ignited an even more intense flame of anger and bravely persisted in their struggle until 2:00 AM on October 22, paralyzing the transportation related to the New Host Station.

	In Osaka, the center of the Kansai region, more than 100,000 workers, students, and citizens participated in a massive anti-American demonstration. Workers and students from Kyoto and Hyogo Prefecture also joined the demonstration. From the evening, a four-and-a-half-kilometer-long street was filled with demonstrators. This was the largest and most intense struggle scene in the Kansai region since the 1960 struggle against the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.'

	The demonstrators fearlessly surrounded the police who came to suppress them and bravely fought back, driving them away. Some of the crowd also attacked the Sonezaki Police Station near Osaka Station. The struggle lasted for four hours.

	In Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Aichi, Shizuoka, Aomori, and other places where there are American military bases and facilities, the Japanese people held anti-American rallies and demonstrations.

	The Japanese people's anti-American struggle this time was launched under the threat and intimidation of the reactionary Sato government, which arrogantly ordered that the Japanese people were not allowed to hold rallies and demonstrations at the New Host Station on October 21. This shows that the awakened Japanese workers and youth have raised the banner of "Rebellion is justified" against the reactionaries and do not care about bourgeois laws. Moreover, in the struggle, the broad masses of workers and youth broke through the framework of the mass movements controlled by the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuemon, and began to take a series of violent and militant actions, opening up a new situation for the Japanese mass movements.

	This anti-American struggle exposed the traitorous face of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuemon. The Kyuemon group not only does not oppose the Japanese and American reactionaries but also sabotages the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle in every way. On October 21, the Kyuemon group sent people to a mass rally in Tokyo to speak, but as soon as they appeared, the crowd below angrily shouted: "Get out! Get out! You don't fight, so what are you doing here!" In Nagoya, the Kyuemon group even set up a security line at the demonstration site, attempting to cooperate with the Japanese reactionary government to stop the anti-American demonstration, but their plot was met with a shameful failure.

	The Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle will certainly make new progress as the Japanese people become more awakened.

    高举对反动派“造反有理”的大旗打破日修控制群众运动的框框
    日本人民掀起激烈的反美斗争
    东京三万工人学生怒冲新宿车站，打退警察的进攻，迫使车站停止运输美军燃料大阪十多万群众举行八年来最大规模反美示威，同前来镇压的警察展开英勇搏斗
    新华社二十三日讯　东京消息：日本人民在二十一日举行声势浩大的反美斗争，其规模之大，斗争之激烈，是几年来日本群众运动中罕见的。
    在东京，运输美军飞机燃料的重要转运站——新宿车站，成了这次反美示威中斗争非常激烈的地方。这天晚上，三万名日本工人、学生和市民陆续来到新宿车站前。站前呈现出红旗如海、群众如潮的雄壮景象。在车站广场上，举行了群众大会。示威群众高举无数面红旗，有一面写着“毛泽东思想万岁”的大旗迎风招展。会场上不断响起“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”、“撤除驻日美军基地”等口号声。在大会上，一位学生发表讲话说：亚非拉人民的革命斗争正在沉重地打击着美帝国主义。现在是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。日本人民的反美斗争是世界革命斗争的一个重要组成部分。让我们行动起来，狠狠地打击美日反动派，用暴力斗争粉碎日美“安全条约”和撤除驻日美军基地，解放冲绳。他最后高呼：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”
    与此同时，一支由工人和学生组成的示威队伍，突破了日本反动当局最近用铁板筑起的围墙，冲进了新宿车站，并在月台和火车轨道上同法西斯警察展开了短兵相接的斗争，阻止运输美军飞机燃料。他们同铁路工人汇合在一起，控制了整个车站。佐藤反动政府丧心病狂地命令全副武装的警察对示威群众进行野蛮的镇压。但是，工人和青年学生不畏强暴，筑起障垒，投掷石块，英勇还击警察，几次打退了警察的进攻。为了惩罚美日反动派，愤怒的日本工人和青年学生捣毁了停在站内的车厢和车站的信号灯以及其他设备。有些青年学生还爬上货车，居高临下，向警察投掷石块。他们还点火焚烧了警察筑起的障垒。日本警察向群众投掷了大量催泪弹，但是，群众毫不畏惧，继续坚持斗争，一再击退了武装警察的进攻，把他们打得狼狈万状。一辆停在站内的日本警察当局拍摄电视用的车，也被愤怒的群众捣毁并推翻焚毁了。示威群众面对熊熊的火焰，不断地发出胜利的欢呼声。这时，日本当局赶紧派出消防车，但遭到了群众的阻拦，消防车只好停在远处，反动警察眼巴巴地看着那辆警察局的车继续燃烧。
    到了二十二日零点十五分，佐藤反动政府竟然下令大肆逮捕示威工人和学生以及前来支援的群众。但是，佐藤政府的这一套根本吓不倒坚持反美爱国斗争的日本广大人民。他们燃起了更加炽烈的愤怒的火焰，英勇顽强地把斗争坚持到二十二日凌晨两点，迫使与新宿车站相关连的交通运输完全陷于瘫痪。
    日本关西地区的中心大阪举行了有十多万工人、学生和市民参加的反美大示威。京都、兵库县的工人和学生也参加了这次示威游行。从傍晚起，长达四公里半的御堂筋大街，挤满了示威群众。这是关西地区自一九六○年反对日美“安全条约”斗争以来出现的最大规模的、剧烈的斗争场面。
    示威群众毫不畏惧地把前来镇压的警察包围起来，勇敢地进行反击，打退了警察。一部分群众还袭击了大阪车站近旁的曾根崎警察署。这场斗争持续了四个小时。
    福冈、广岛、爱知、静冈、青森等地，凡是有美军基地和军事设施的地方，都有日本人民在进行反美集会和示威游行。
    日本人民的这次反美斗争，是在佐藤反动政府一再进行威胁和恫吓，狂妄地下令不准日本人民在二十一日这一天在新宿车站举行集会和示威的情况下展开的。这表明，有觉悟的日本工人和青年学生高举对反动派“造反有理”的大旗，根本不把资产阶级法律放在眼里。而且，在斗争中，广大工人、青年学生打破了过去日共宫本修正主义集团所控制的群众运动的框框，开始采取了一系列富有战斗性的暴烈行动，为日本的群众运动打开了新局面。
    这次反美斗争使日共宫本修正主义集团的叛徒嘴脸原形毕露。宫本集团不仅自己不反对美日反动派，反而对日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争百般破坏。二十一日，宫本集团派人到东京的一个群众集会上大放厥词。但是他一露头，台下群众就愤怒地高呼：滚回去！滚回去！你们根本不斗争，还来干什么！在名古屋，宫本集团竟然在群众游行示威的地方布置纠察线，企图协同日本反动政府阻止反美示威，但是他们的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。
    日本人民的反美爱国斗争，随着日本人民的进一步觉醒，必将有新的进展。（附图片）
    十月二十一日，日本人民举行声势浩大的反美示威斗争，规模之大，斗争之激烈，是几年来日本群众斗争中罕见的。冲进新宿车站的工人和学生垒起屏障，同法西斯警察英勇斗争。
