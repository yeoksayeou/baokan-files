Fuzhou Eastern Electric Motor Factory resolutely faces the countryside to serve agricultural production. The revolutionary workers of Fuzhou Eastern Electric Motor Factory in Fujian Province have thoroughly criticized the "profit-first" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies peddled by China's Khrushchev, resolutely facing the countryside to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, and powerfully supporting agricultural production and construction.

Fuzhou Eastern Electric Motor Factory was built during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the frenzied promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line by China's Khrushchev and his agents, this factory did not properly face the countryside. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of Fuzhou Eastern Electric Motor Factory, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's thought, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as "running a factory is to make money" peddled by China's Khrushchev and his agents, and swept away the obstacles blocking the enterprise from facing the countryside. The revolutionary workers of this factory, to better support agricultural production and construction, with boundless enthusiasm, vigorously grasped the revolution and vigorously promoted production, and by the end of September had completed this year's agricultural electric motor production task three months ahead of schedule.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our responsibility is to the people." The revolutionary workers of Fuzhou Eastern Electric Motor Factory, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching, changed the past practice of only manufacturing without considering use and repair. They organized an external repair team, carrying tools and parts, crossing mountains and rivers, to many communes and production brigades, investigating the use of factory electric motors, soliciting opinions, and repairing on the spot when needed. The workers of the external repair team, while excellently completing the repair tasks, also taught the broad poor and lower-middle peasant community members the principles of electric motors, repair methods, and maintenance techniques.

    闽东电机厂
    坚决面向农村为农业生产服务
    福建省闽东电机厂的革命工人，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的“利润挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，坚决面向农村，为贫下中农服务，有力地支援了农业生产建设。
    闽东电机厂是一九五八年大跃进中兴建起来的。无产阶级文化大革命前，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人疯狂推行反革命修正主义路线，这个厂没有很好地面向农村。在无产阶级文化大革命中，闽东电机厂的革命工人，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人鼓吹的“办工厂，就是要多赚钱”等反革命修正主义黑货，扫除了堵塞企业面向农村的障碍。这个厂的革命工人为了很好地支援农业生产建设，以冲天的干劲，狠抓革命，猛促生产，已在九月底提前三个月完成了今年农用电机的生产任务。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”闽东电机厂的革命工人遵照毛主席的这一教导，改变了过去只管制造，不管使用、修理的做法。他们组织了外修组背上工具、配件，翻山越岭，到了许多公社、生产大队，调查出厂电机的使用状况，征求意见，遇到需要维修的便马上修理。外修组的工人们在出色地完成修理任务的同时还把电机原理、修理方法、保养技术传授给广大贫下中农社员。（据新华社）
