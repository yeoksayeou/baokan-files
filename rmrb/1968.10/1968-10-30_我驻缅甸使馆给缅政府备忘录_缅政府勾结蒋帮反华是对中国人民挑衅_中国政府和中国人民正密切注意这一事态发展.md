The Chinese Embassy in Burma handed a memorandum to the Burmese government on October 24, demanding that the Burmese government immediately take measures to stop all treasonous activities by KMT bandits in Burma. The memorandum pointed out that the Burmese government, in collusion with the public enemy of the Chinese people and the political zombie fostered by U.S. imperialism—the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, is engaged in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. This is a serious provocation against the Chinese people.

Since last June, the Burmese authorities have intensified their incitement of KMT bandits to hold meetings and form associations, rallying reactionary overseas Chinese organizations to engage in activities that betray the motherland and harm the legitimate rights and interests of the vast majority of patriotic overseas Chinese. In September of this year, KMT bandits openly established in Rangoon the so-called "Federation of Free Overseas Chinese in Burma," an organization whose stated purpose is to oppose the People's Republic of China. This is part of the Burmese government's planned policy of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities and its attempt to create "two Chinas." The Chinese government and the Chinese people are closely watching the development of this situation.

    缅政府勾结蒋帮反华是对中国人民挑衅
    中国政府和中国人民正密切注意这一事态发展
    新华社二十八日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二十四日把一份备忘录交给缅甸政府，要求缅甸政府立即采取措施制止蒋介石匪帮分子在缅甸的一切背叛祖国的阴谋活动。备忘录指出，缅甸政府勾结中国人民的公敌、美帝豢养的政治僵尸——蒋介石卖国集团，进行反华排华活动，是对中国人民的严重挑衅。
    去年六月以来，缅甸当局加紧怂恿蒋介石匪帮分子集会结社，纠集反动的华侨社团，进行背叛祖国和危害广大爱国华侨正当权益的活动。今年九月，蒋介石匪帮分子在仰光公开成立了以反对中华人民共和国为目的的所谓“旅缅华侨自由侨团联合总会”的叛国组织。这是缅甸政府有计划地推行反华排华政策和企图制造“两个中国”的阴谋的一个组成部分。中国政府和中国人民正密切注意这一事态的发展。
