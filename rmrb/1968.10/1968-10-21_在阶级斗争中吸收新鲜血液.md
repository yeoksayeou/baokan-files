The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader China's Khrushchev has long been brazenly opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, peddling the infamous "theory of the extinction of class struggle," and promoting the notorious "Study of Revisionism." His aim is to use the method of "secluded cultivation" to cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie. China's Khrushchev attempts to strangle the revolutionary nature of the Party, making the broad masses of Party members forget about class struggle, becoming "those who hear no worldly affairs outside the window, reading only the classics," and unwittingly turning into docile tools for China's Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism. If China's Khrushchev's plot succeeds, then "it is inevitable that a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration will occur, the Marxist-Leninist Party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color."

Who to recruit into the Party? How to cultivate Party members? This has always been a struggle between two lines in the history of our Party. The great leader Chairman Mao has always pointed out that Communist Party members must not sit in the house without going out; such Party members are not needed by the people. He taught us: "Our Communist Party members should weather storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, so that the Party organization can absorb fresh blood in the struggle, and Party members can grow and temper themselves in the struggle.

In this great proletarian cultural revolution, a struggle between two classes and two lines, our company has, in the past two years, recruited thirteen new comrades into the Party organization. They have good backgrounds, good thoughts, a fighting spirit, are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and harbor deep hatred for China's Khrushchev. This has added fresh blood to the Party branch, greatly strengthened the role of the branch as a fortress of struggle, and greatly enhanced the company's combat effectiveness.

Communist Party members armed with Mao Zedong Thought are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They can withstand all kinds of severe tests in storms and waves. Once, under the model role of the Communist Party members, the entire company, with high fighting spirit, rushed to the battle positions with the slogan "Down with China's Khrushchev, defend Chairman Mao!" Many Communist Party members, disregarding personal safety, carefully checked their weapons at the moment the battle began, assisted brother units in preparing for battle, and when others told them to avoid danger, they said: "Loyalty to Chairman Mao means not fearing death; fearing death is being poisoned by China's Khrushchev's philosophy of survival. When class enemies invade, it is a life-and-death struggle. We must ensure the annihilation of the enemy." Everyone fought bravely and tenaciously in the battle, fearing no sacrifice, and achieved a great victory. This is how we arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's great thoughts and, through actual combat actions, criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line.

    在阶级斗争中吸收新鲜血液
    某部指导员  高学士
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，长期以来猖狂地同毛主席的无产阶级建党路线相对抗，大肆贩卖“阶级斗争熄灭论”，鼓吹臭名远扬的黑《修养》。他的用心就是要千方百计用“闭门修养”的方法培养资产阶级的接班人。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图扼杀党的无产阶级革命性，就是要使广大党员忘记阶级斗争，成为“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”的糊涂人，在不知不觉中变成中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的驯服工具。中国赫鲁晓夫的这一阴谋如果得逞，那么，“就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    吸收什么样的人入党？用什么方法培养党员？这在我党历史上是一直存在着两条路线的激烈斗争的。伟大领袖毛主席一贯指出，共产党员绝不能坐在房子里不出去，这样的党员是人民所不需要的。他老人家教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”我们就是要坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，使党组织在斗争中吸收新鲜血液，使党员在斗争中锻炼成长。
    我们连在无产阶级文化大革命这场两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争中，近两年来吸收了十三名新同志加入了党的组织。他们出身好，思想好，有斗争精神，对毛主席无限忠诚，对中国赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨。这使党支部增添了新鲜血液，大大加强了支部的战斗堡垒作用，大大提高了连队的战斗力。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党员，无限忠于毛主席。他们在大风大浪中经得起各种严峻的考验。一次，在共产党员的模范作用的带动下，全连以高昂的战斗意志，在高喊“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，保卫毛主席”的口号声中，奔向战斗岗位。许多共产党员不顾个人安危，在战斗打响的时刻，还细心地检查兵器，协助兄弟单位作好战斗准备，别人叫他们避开，他们说：“忠于毛主席不能怕死，怕死是中了中国赫鲁晓夫活命哲学的毒，阶级敌人来侵犯，是你死我活的斗争，我们一定要保证消灭敌人。”大家在战斗中英勇顽强，不怕牺牲，取得重大胜利。我们就是这样用毛主席的伟大思想武装自己，用英勇作战的实际行动，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。
