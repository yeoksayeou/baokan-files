Our factory often holds on-site criticism meetings in various work teams. The more we hold them, the more enthusiastic the criticism becomes, and the more heated the meetings get. Everyone says: On-site criticism meetings are good!

Good in what way?

It is good in that it can mobilize the broadest mass of workers to participate in the great criticism.

In the past, when criticism was conducted by workshop, it was good, but with a few hundred people attending, only about ten people could speak in two hours. Moreover, it was inevitable that "writing relies on scholars, and speaking relies on eloquence." How could this compare to holding meetings in work teams on-site, where real people and real issues are present, and anger is stirred up immediately? Who would care about "eloquence" or "scholarship"? Anger in the heart must be vented, and words in the throat must be spoken. Therefore, everyone takes part, and everyone speaks up, making the meetings very lively.

It is good in that it involves close combat, fighting fiercely, and criticizing thoroughly.

Ironclad facts are presented before everyone, and living enemies are brought to the forefront. This is a 200-meter battle, requiring top-notch skills. Although workers are rough and tough, they won't engage in wordplay. When criticism gets intense, a single sentence can be as powerful as a cannon shot. They truly criticize a handful of class enemies to the point of speechlessness, fighting them to the ground and leaving them with no face to show.

It is good in that it is flexible and mobile, clearing away poison wherever it is found, without being limited by time or space.

The workbench and the machine are excellent venues for meetings. Before and after shifts, a few dozen minutes are excellent times. Discovering a bit of poison, achieving a bit of progress, these are excellent topics. Bring the enemy to the site and hold a great criticism. At any time and place, the power of great criticism can be unleashed.

It is good in that it involves criticizing while fighting, and changing while criticizing, with destruction as the priority, and construction within it.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform." Without thorough criticism, the enemy cannot be defeated; without thorough criticism and defeat, reform cannot be achieved. On-site criticism is a good method that closely combines the three. Aiming at a living target, the firepower must be strong, and the enemy can be defeated. The black goods of revisionism are right in front, using personal experience to criticize on the spot, and criticizing thoroughly. Once defeated and criticized thoroughly, change can be implemented immediately. New systems and regulations can be established right away, and there will be no turning back.

In summary, it is good in every way, but ultimately, it is good because it is a living classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought.

The enemy is in front, in a 200-meter close combat. This is a battle that allows no defeat. What ensures victory? It is Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought. We workers have a heart full of loyalty and hold the red book tightly. We learn one quote from Chairman Mao and criticize one segment of China's Khrushchev's black words, breaking one item of China's Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies. Using the battlefield as a classroom, learning is especially solid and practical.

With the living study and application of Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought, on-site criticism meetings are indeed good!

    现场批判会好
    群工
    我们厂里，各班组常开现场批判会，越开批得越起劲，越批开得越热火。大伙都说：现场批判会好！
    好在哪里？
    它好在：能最广泛地动员工人群众参加大批判。
    过去以车间为单位搞大批判，好是好，就是几百人开会，两个钟头也只得十来个人上台发言。而且免不了“写稿靠秀才，发言靠口才”。怎么说也比不上班组里现场开会，活人活事，一见就有气，谁个还计较“口才”、“秀才”？气在肚子里就是要出，话在喉咙里就是要说。因此，个个上阵，人人开口，红火得很。
    它好在：短兵相接，斗得狠，批得透。
    铁的事实摆在眼前，活的敌人揪到面前，这是二百米地段的战斗，最需要过硬功夫。别看工人是大老粗，不会咬文嚼字，批判到狠处，“当”的一句，真抵一发炮弹。硬是把一小撮阶级敌人批得哑口无言，斗得颜面扫地。
    它好在：灵活机动，哪里有流毒就在哪里肃清，不受时间、空间限制。
    工作台前，机器旁边，都是极好的会场。班前班后，几十分钟，都是极好的时间。发现一点流毒，创造一项成绩，都是极好的题目，把敌人揪到现场，就搞大批判。随时随地都发挥大批判的威力。
    它好在：在斗争中批、在批判中改，破字当头，立也就在其中了。
    毛主席指出：“认真搞好斗、批、改”。不彻底批判，就斗不倒；不批透斗倒，就改不了。现场批判是使三者紧密结合的好方式。对准活靶子开炮，火力必然猛，斗得倒。修正主义黑货眼前就有物证，用亲身体会当场批，批得透。既已斗倒批透，说改就改，新制度、新规程马上树立起来，再不走回头路。
    千好万好，归根结底一条，它就好在是活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。
    敌人当前，二百米近战。这是只许赢、不许败的战斗。打胜仗靠什么？就靠毛泽东思想。咱工人就是胸怀红彤彤的忠字，手捧红彤彤的宝书，学一条毛主席语录，就批一段中国赫鲁晓夫的黑话，破一项中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义谬论。以战场作课堂，学得就特别扎实、顶用。
    有了活学活用毛泽东思想这一条，现场批判会确实是好！
