The important editorial note in the third issue of 1968 of the *Red Flag* magazine points out: "For a large number of graduates from colleges and secondary schools who have been working and are currently working, we must pay attention to their re-education, so that they can unite with workers and peasants." Over the past few years, our work practice has made us deeply realize the importance and necessity of re-educating intellectuals and uniting them with workers and peasants.

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our institute have vigorously promoted a revisionist scientific and technological line that separates from proletarian politics, separates from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and separates from production practice. This has caused us to stay in tall buildings for a long time, isolated from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past, for us intellectuals who have not undergone serious reform, the countryside was synonymous with hardship, poverty, and backwardness. After several years of promoting hybrid sorghum, we have deeply understood Chairman Mao's teaching that "the countryside is a vast expanse where one can achieve great things." We have also come to realize that poor and lower-middle peasants are our best teachers. Therefore, going to the countryside and uniting with the poor and lower-middle peasants has gradually become a conscious requirement and action for each of us.

Our change in thoughts and feelings has gone through a long struggle. It was Chairman Mao who guided us out of the tall buildings to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers; it was Chairman Mao who guided us to break free from the shackles of foreign theories and walk the path of serving proletarian politics and uniting with production practice.

Hybrid sorghum, with its large panicles and heavy grains, strong adaptability, and high yield, has been praised by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants as the "beyond-quota variety" and the "treasure of saline-alkali land." It is now widely planted in the Huang-Huai-Hai region and has left its footprint in various parts of the country. However, like other new things, the birth and development of hybrid sorghum have not been smooth sailing.

In 1958, under the brilliant guidance of the Three Red Banners, the task of breeding hybrid sorghum was proposed. A few "ordinary people" responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, broke through old frameworks, and shattered foreign dogmas. Finally, in 1962, we bred the first batch of hybrid sorghum in our country. Because hybrid sorghum has great potential for increased production and strong adaptability, it has been welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, the task of promoting hybrid sorghum fell on our shoulders. However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and those "experts" and "authorities" obstructed our promotion work in every possible way, attempting to steer the promotion of hybrid sorghum towards pure theoretical research. Some people deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology also thought: "The Academy should focus on 'improvement' and 'theory.' Promotion is the business of the countryside and the grassroots; we can ignore it." Whether or not to engage in promotion (which is essentially whether or not to unite with the masses of workers and peasants) became the focal point of the debate.

It was Chairman Mao who pointed out the direction for us and gave us boundless strength. Chairman Mao taught us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle. ... This fundamental question is not solved, and many other questions will also not be easily solved." We followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "wholeheartedly serving the people" and "the basis of theory is practice, and it in turn serves practice." We walked out of the tall buildings and out of the small world of the Institute of Genetics.

"Look at the waves of rice and millet, heroes descend into the evening smoke." In the vast expanse of the countryside, the heroic images of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres inspire, educate, and encourage us. They are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They study Chairman Mao's works the best and apply them the most effectively. They detest those intellectuals who think they are great but whose words and deeds are inconsistent, and those who have a habit of empty talk and a two-faced attitude. They dare to think, speak, and act, and they dare to revolutionize. They strongly oppose the revisionist scientific research line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. They have the most practical experience, are the smartest, most talented, and most opposed to the bad habit of some intellectuals whose theories are detached from practice.

In the countryside, we deeply realized that Chairman Mao's teaching that "the masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and laughable, not understanding this, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge" is an unshakable truth.

When we first started promoting hybrid sorghum, a bourgeois reactionary academic "authority" wanted to create a "demonstration" field in the suburbs of Beijing. With the support of capitalist roaders, he spared no effort to try to achieve a yield of over a thousand jin per mu to realize his ambition of fame and profit. The "authority's" "ideal" has not been realized from 1963 to the present. However, in some places, the poor and lower-middle peasants, under the great encouragement and strong impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm, seized the revolution and vigorously promoted production. In 1966 and 1967, they consecutively achieved a high yield of over 1,100 jin per mu over a large area. Miracles that bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" could not create were created by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Hybrid sorghum is obtained by hybridizing two types of sorghum. To ensure that these two types of sorghum can hybridize well, it is necessary to know in advance whether they can bloom at the same time. To solve this problem, we invited "experts" and "authorities" to come up with ideas and suggestions. Based on the "theory" in the books, they proposed the "accumulated temperature calculation method." According to this method, we looked up books and flipped through materials, calculating day and night, becoming dizzy and confused, but still could not calculate it. Later, following Chairman Mao's teachings, we discarded the old frameworks and took the path of uniting with workers and peasants. In production practice, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, we observed and compared. The poor and lower-middle peasants, with their rich practical experience, discovered that as long as the leaf number difference is maintained during growth, it would be fine. This method is simple and practical, and more accurate and reliable. It has been widely adopted in the hybrid sorghum seed production work.

Hybrid sorghum, due to its large panicles and heavy grains, is prone to lodging when mature. For this problem, we only knew to work on water and fertilizer, but we were not clear on how to do it. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, through production practice, have summarized a complete set of methods that can prevent the lodging of hybrid sorghum and achieve high yield, ensuring the continuous bumper harvest of hybrid sorghum.

Chairman Mao said: "We should go among the masses, learn from the masses, and summarize their experiences into better, more systematic theories and methods, then tell the masses (propagate) and call on the masses to implement them, solving the problems of the masses." Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and respectfully learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants can we make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress in scientific research.

Intellectuals nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought resolutely follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, unyielding in the face of wind and waves. We must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, firmly take the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers as pointed out by Chairman Mao, and forever serve the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    知识分子必须与工农群众相结合
    中国科学院遗传研究所高粱组
    《红旗》杂志一九六八年第三期重要编者按中指出：“对过去大量的高等及中等学校毕业生早已从事工作及现正从事工作的人们，要注意对他们进行再教育，使他们与工农结合起来。”几年来的工作实践，使我们深深体会到对知识分子进行再教育以及知识分子与工农群众相结合的重要性和必要性。
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我院我所的代理人，极力推行脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农兵群众，脱离生产实践的修正主义科技路线，使我们长期深居高楼大厦，脱离工农兵群众。过去，对于我们这些还没有经过认真改造的知识分子来说，农村，是艰苦、贫穷、落后的代名词。经过几年来从事杂交高粱的推广工作，我们才深刻地领会到毛主席的教导“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”我们还认识到，贫下中农是我们最好的老师。因此，到农村去，和贫下中农相结合，已开始成为我们每一个人的自觉要求和行动。
    我们思想感情的变化，经过了长期的斗争。是毛主席指引我们走出了大楼，和工农兵相结合；是毛主席指引我们摆脱了洋理论的束缚，走上了为无产阶级政治服务，与生产实践相结合的道路。
    杂交高粱，穗大粒重，适应性强，产量高，被广大贫下中农誉为“超纲要品种”，“盐碱地的宝贝”。现已在黄淮海地区广泛种植，在全国各地都有了它的足迹。然而杂交高粱和其他新生事物一样，它的诞生与发展并不是一帆风顺的。
    一九五八年，在三面红旗的光辉照耀下，提出了选育杂交高粱的问题。几个“小人物”响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神，冲破旧框框，打破洋教条，终于在一九六二年培育出我国第一批杂交高粱。由于杂交高粱增产潜力大，适应性强，受到了广大贫下中农的欢迎。因此，推广杂交高粱的任务就落在我们的肩上。但党内一小撮走资派和那些“专家”、“权威”却百般地阻挠我们搞推广工作，企图把杂交高粱的推广工作引向纯理论的研究。有的受资产阶级思想影响很深的人也认为：“科学院应该搞‘提高’，应该搞‘理论’，搞推广是农村的事，是基层的事，我们可以不管。”要不要搞推广（实际上就是要不要和工农群众相结合），就成了争论的焦点。
    是毛主席给我们指出了方向，给了我们无穷的力量。毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。……这个根本问题不解决，其他许多问题也就不易解决。”我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，遵照“理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务”的教导，走出了大楼，走出了遗传研究所的小天地。
    “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”在农村的广阔天地里，广大贫下中农和革命干部的英雄形象激励着我们，教育着我们，鼓舞着我们。他们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线最忠，对毛主席著作学得最好，用得最活。他们最讨厌那些自以为很了不起的知识分子言行不一致的空谈习气和两面派作风。他们敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命，最反对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义科研路线。他们最有实践经验，最聪明，最有才能，最反对某些知识分子理论脱离实践的坏作风。
    在农村里，我们深刻地认识到，毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识”的教导是颠扑不破的真理。
    我们刚开始搞推广的时候，一个资产阶级反动学术“权威”，却要在北京郊区搞一亩“示范”田。他在走资派支持下，不惜工本，妄图达到亩产超千斤，实现他名利双收的野心。“权威”的“理想”，从一九六三年到现在还没有实现。可是，有的地方的贫下中农，在无产阶级文化大革命的巨大鼓舞和有力推动下，以空前未有的革命热情，狠抓革命、猛促生产，在一九六六年、一九六七年连续两年在大面积上取得了亩产一千一百多斤的高额收成。资产阶级“专家”、“权威”，创造不出来的奇迹，贫下中农创造出来了。
    杂交高粱，是由两种高粱进行杂交以后得来的，为了保证这两种高粱能很好地进行杂交，需要预先就知道这两种高粱能不能同时开花。为了解决这个问题，我们请来了“专家”、“权威”，让他们想办法，出主意，他们根据书本上的“理论”，提出了“积温计算法”。按照这个办法，我们查书本、翻资料，日夜进行计算，算来算去，搞得头晕脑胀，还是算不出来。后来，我们遵照毛主席的教导，抛开了旧框框，走与工农相结合的道路，在生产实践中，和贫下中农一起观察、比较。有着丰富生产实践经验的贫下中农发现，只要在生长过程中使两种高粱保持一定的叶片差数就行了。这个办法简单易行，而且比较准确可靠，已在杂交高粱制种工作中普遍采用。
    杂交高粱，由于穗大粒重，成熟时容易倒伏，对于这个问题，我们只知道从水、肥上下功夫，但这功夫到底怎么下，我们并不清楚。而广大的贫下中农，在生产实践中总结出了一套完整的办法，既能防止杂交高粱的倒伏，又能获得高产，保证了杂交高粱的年年丰收。
    毛主席说：“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理和办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传），并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题”。我们只有遵照毛主席的教导，恭恭敬敬地向贫下中农学习，才能在科学研究上，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。
    用毛泽东思想哺育起来的知识分子，坚决沿着毛主席的革命路线走，风吹不回头，浪打不动摇。我们一定要狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，坚定地走毛主席指出的与工农兵相结合的道路，永远为工农兵群众服务。
