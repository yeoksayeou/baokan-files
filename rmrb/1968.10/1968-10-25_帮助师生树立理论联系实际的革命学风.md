The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Hubei Medical College has, through heart-to-heart talks, enthusiastically and patiently re-educated revolutionary teachers and students, thereby overcoming bourgeois factionalism, enhancing unity, and consolidating and developing the revolutionary tripartite alliance.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 24th - The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Hubei Medical College has, through extensive heart-to-heart talks with revolutionary teachers and students, enthusiastically and meticulously re-educated them with Mao Zedong Thought. This has further consolidated and developed the revolutionary unity and the revolutionary tripartite alliance at this medical college.

Hubei Medical College established a revolutionary committee as early as last November, but due to the interference of bourgeois factionalism, it split into two factions in May of this year. After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team arrived, they immediately organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the school. The workers and PLA comrades from the propaganda team formed study groups with the original two factions of teachers and students, living, eating, and studying together, forming a "red pair." During the study process, the propaganda team comrades followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "conduct heart-to-heart talks, which is a good method," and conducted extensive heart-to-heart talks with revolutionary teachers and students. They also encouraged revolutionary teachers and students to talk to each other, using the principles of Mao Zedong Thought to unite and fight against the enemy together through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism.

During the heart-to-heart talks, the workers from the propaganda team paid special attention to addressing living thoughts, patiently and meticulously persuading and educating the two opposing factions of students. In this school, two students from the class of 1964 had particularly severe opposing sentiments. The workers' propaganda team paired them up as a "red pair" and encouraged them to talk to each other, raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. However, due to their petty-bourgeois pride, the two still had deep-seated grievances. A veteran worker from the propaganda team noticed this and immediately had a heart-to-heart talk with one of the students, educating him to be a pioneer in criticizing and repudiating oneself, pointing out that without overcoming the "self," the first step of ideological transformation cannot be taken. The veteran worker's sincere teachings deeply moved the student, who then actively sought out the other student for a serious self-criticism. The two students, who had deep-seated grievances, finally became close friends. Teachers and students unanimously reflected that conducting heart-to-heart talks was like a gentle rain, dripping into the heart, with very good effects.

Through conducting heart-to-heart talks, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team has earnestly helped some teachers and students overcome the bad learning style of words not matching deeds and theory being detached from practice, gradually establishing a revolutionary learning style of theorizing from practice. Workers and PLA soldiers encouraged teachers and students to study Mao Zedong Thought with the most realistic, most thought-provoking, and most soul-stirring problems. During the study process, they helped them overcome the bad habit of long-winded speeches without practical connection, focusing on some basic viewpoints in Chairman Mao's instructions for repeated study and practice, affirming their bit-by-bit achievements, and continuously mobilizing their revolutionary enthusiasm. When teachers and students had setbacks in their thoughts, they would patiently guide them, using their own experiences and personal feelings to educate them. Many teachers and students, through heart-to-heart talks, found the gap between themselves and the workers and PLA comrades, realizing that intellectuals must accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, greatly enhancing their awareness of accepting re-education. They said, "Workers and PLA comrades read Chairman Mao's books and truly apply them in practice to transform their own thoughts and society; while we read Chairman Mao's books, we often take them out of context, even distorting them to serve our own little hilltops." Therefore, they actively sought out workers and PLA soldiers for heart-to-heart talks, asking workers and PLA comrades to point out their shortcomings, and when encountering problems, they would seek help from workers and PLA comrades to solve them, always taking workers and PLA comrades as examples, using the image of the working class to continuously transform themselves, and their spiritual appearance has changed greatly. Currently, the entire school's teachers and students are united against the enemy, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation have reached a new high tide.

    帮助师生树立理论联系实际的革命学风
    进驻湖北医学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，通过谈心活动，热情、耐心地对革命师生进行再教育，从而克服了资产阶级派性，增强了团结，巩固和发展了革命三结合
    新华社武汉二十四日电　进驻湖北医学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，通过同革命师生广泛开展谈心活动，热情地、耐心细致地用毛泽东思想对革命师生进行再教育，使这个医学院的革命大联合和革命三结合得到了进一步的巩固和发展。
    湖北医学院早在去年十一月就成立了革命委员会，但是由于资产阶级派性作怪，今年五月又分裂成为两派。工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻以后，就在全校大办毛泽东思想学习班。宣传队的工人和解放军同志同原来两派的师生，在学习班里编成一个小组，实行同吃、同住、同学习，结成“一组红”。在学习过程中，宣传队的同志遵照伟大领袖毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，同革命师生广泛开展谈心活动，同时发动革命师生互相谈心，通过斗私批修，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上团结一致，共同对敌。
    工人宣传队的同志在谈心活动中，特别注意抓住活的思想，向对立的两派师生做耐心细致的说服教育工作。这个学校六四级有两个同学对立情绪比较严重，工人宣传队把他们结成“一对红”，发动他们互相谈心，共同提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。但是，由于小资产阶级的面子放不下，两人还是隔阂很深。宣传队的一位老工人发现后，立即找其中的一个学生谈心，教育他要当斗私的闯将，指出不斗倒“私”字，思想革命化的第一步就迈不出去。老工人语重心长的教诲，使这个学生很受感动，他主动找另一位同学认真作了自我批评，这两个隔阂很深的同学，终于成了知心朋友。师生们一致反映，开展谈心活动，就象下毛毛细雨那样，点滴入心，效果很好。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队通过开展谈心活动，认真帮助一些师生克服言行不一、理论脱离实际的坏学风，一点一滴地树立起理论与实际相结合的革命学风。工人和解放军战士鼓励师生们带着最现实、最接触思想、最能触及灵魂的问题学习毛泽东思想，在学习过程中帮助他们克服长篇大论，不联系实际的坏习气，抓住毛主席指示中的一些基本观点反复学习、反复实践，肯定他们的点滴成绩，不断调动他们革命的积极因素。当师生们的思想有反复时，就对他们循循善诱，以自己的经验教训和亲身体会来教育他们。许多教师和学生通过谈心活动，找到了自己同工人和解放军同志的差距，认识到知识分子必须接受工农兵的再教育，大大提高了接受再教育的自觉性。他们说，工人和解放军同志读了毛主席的书，真正能活学活用，用来改造自己的思想，改造社会；而自己读了毛主席的书，却往往断章取义，甚至加以歪曲，用来为自己的小山头服务。因此，他们主动找工人和解放军战士交心谈心，请工人、解放军同志给自己提意见，指出缺点，遇到问题就找工人和解放军战士帮助解决，处处以工人和解放军同志为榜样，用工人阶级的面貌不断改造自己，精神面貌起了很大变化。目前，全校师生团结对敌，斗、批、改出现了新的高潮。
