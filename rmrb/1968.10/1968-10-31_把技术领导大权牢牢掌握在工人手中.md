The workers of Nanjing Puzhen Vehicle Factory, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have taken firm hold of the technical leadership. They have demonstrated great creativity by organizing numerous "three-in-one combination" technical innovation teams, primarily composed of workers. They have successfully completed over 300 technical innovation projects, significantly improving production efficiency. They have also eradicated the "three major hazards" that had long plagued the factory: excessive sand dust from sandblasting passenger cars, excessive paint mist from painting passenger cars, and excessive smoke from boiler chimneys. This has ensured the health of the workers.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the capitalist roaders in this factory vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They peddled black goods such as "technology first," "expert management," "material incentives," and the "crawling philosophy." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary workers, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, carried out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle. They smashed the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and seized back the technical leadership that had been usurped by a handful of reactionary technical "authorities." The broad masses of workers in the entire factory, following Chairman Mao's instructions to launch mass movements, adopted the "three-in-one combination" method of workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and leading cadres. They established "three-in-one combination" technical innovation teams in all 13 workshops, with workers as the main force. A large number of so-called "technical illiterates" became the mainstay of science and technology. They dared to think, dared to act, and dared to make revolution. They worked day and night to conduct research and experiments dozens or even hundreds of times. The workers, in order to change the backward appearance of the passenger car exterior panels, repeatedly studied the "Three Articles," overcame hardships, and after thousands of repeated experiments, finally succeeded in developing the new technology of electrostatic spraying for passenger car exterior panels. Many veteran workers determined to seize the technical leadership for the revolution. They overcame the difficulty of lacking education and, relying on their rich practical experience, studied diligently and finally achieved a large number of technical innovations, demonstrating the boundless wisdom and strength of the working class.

In the past, the technical leadership of this factory was in the hands of a handful of capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities." Whenever workers proposed an innovation or a rationalization suggestion, they had to go through five checkpoints and six barriers, seven reviews and eight approvals, and after a big circle, they still did not know the result. Now, the revolutionary committee of the factory relies on the masses of workers to fight resolutely against the old forces of the exploiting class and has carried out a series of reforms in leadership style and regulations. This has greatly unleashed the enthusiasm of the workers. After the factory abolished the inspection system that did not trust the masses, the quality of the products was directly supervised by the production workers and work teams. As a result, the workers' sense of responsibility was enhanced, and the product quality was significantly improved.

    把技术领导大权牢牢掌握在工人手中
    南京浦镇车辆厂组织大批以工人为主体的“三结合”技术革新小组，接连搞成了三百多项技术革新项目，极大地提高了生产效率，显示了工人阶级的无穷智慧和力量
    新华社南京三十日电　南京浦镇车辆厂的工人群众在无产阶级文化大革命中掌握技术领导大权以后，发挥出了巨大的创造性。他们组织起大批的以工人为主体的“三结合”技术革新小组，接连搞成了抛丸除锈、静电喷漆等三百多项技术革新项目，极大地提高了生产效率，并且彻底根除了车辆厂长期不能解决的客车打砂矽尘多、客车喷漆漆雾多、锅炉烟囱里烟多的“三大害”，保障了职工的身体健康。
    在无产阶级文化大革命以前，这个厂的走资派竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，拚命贩卖“技术第一”、“专家治厂”、“物质刺激”、“爬行哲学”等反革命修正主义黑货。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，深入持久地开展革命大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，并且夺回了被一小撮资产阶级反动技术“权威”所篡夺的技术大权。全厂广大工人群众遵照毛主席大搞群众运动的教导，采用工人、革命技术人员和领导干部“三结合”的办法，在全厂十三个车间成立了以工人为主体的“三结合”技术革新小组。一大批所谓“不懂技术”的“大老粗”成了科学技术的主力军。他们敢想、敢干、敢革命，夜以继日地进行研究，几十次、几百次地进行试验。职工们为了改变客车外墙板油漆落后的面貌，反复学习“老三篇”，不怕苦、不怕难，经过上千次的反复试验，终于试制成功客车外墙板静电喷漆新技术。许多老工人决心为革命掌握技术大权，他们克服了没有文化的困难，凭着丰富的实践经验，刻苦研究，终于实现了大批技术革新项目，显示了工人阶级的无穷智慧和力量。
    过去，这个厂的技术大权由于掌握在一小撮走资派和反动的技术“权威”手里，工人搞一次革新，提一件合理化建议，要过五关，闯六卡，七审八批，转了一大圈还不知道结果。现在，厂革命委员会依靠工人群众，向剥削阶级的旧势力进行了坚决斗争，从领导作风上、规章制度上进行了一系列的改革。使工人的积极性得到很大发扬。这个厂去掉了不相信群众的检验制度后，产品质量改由生产工人和工组直接负责，结果提高了工人的责任感，产品质量显著提高。
