The working class of Hunan Province has closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully played a leading role, and achieved great success in grasping the revolution and promoting production. Currently, a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation is surging in Hunan Province's industrial and transportation sectors, and production has significantly increased. The situation in the province's industrial and transportation sectors is unprecedentedly good and getting better.

After a fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, the broad revolutionary workers in Hunan Province have smashed a small clique of class enemies' evil plot to split the ranks of the working class. Revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination have further developed and consolidated in the province's industrial and transportation sectors. More than 90% of the centrally and provincially owned factories and mines have achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination. In the prefectures, cities, and counties, except for a few places, more than 90% of the locally owned state enterprises have also achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The revolutionary upsurge is driving the production upsurge. In August, the province's total industrial output value increased by about 5% compared to July; in September, it increased significantly compared to August.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao approved the invitation of workers' representatives from various places to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration and warmly received the responsible comrades of the revolutionary committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and workers' representatives, which greatly inspired and educated the working class of Hunan Province. The workers excitedly said, "Father and mother are not as close as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud!" They all pledged loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, expressed their determination, and launched a new upsurge in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts. Revolutionary workers across the province have universally carried out the "three loyalties" activity of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more and more numerous and better. In the Zhu Zhou and Xiang Tan areas, since this year, more than 95% of the workers in industrial and transportation enterprises have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The study classes held in various places all take "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, combine actual conditions with studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and have solved many problems.

Currently, more than 30,000 outstanding workers from the province's industrial and transportation sectors have been organized into Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and have entered schools and other units that have not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation. They lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various fields of the superstructure and actively carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units. Revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's great teaching that politics is the commander and the soul, always insist on leading production with revolution. In the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, they use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, seriously clean up the class ranks, and launch a more intense attack on a small number of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, thereby further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and promoting continuous development of production.

In the struggle, criticism, and transformation, many factories and mines have carried out reminiscence and comparison activities, greatly arousing the workers' boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deepening their boundless hatred for a small number of class enemies like China's Khrushchev. They regard producing an extra ton of steel, mining an extra ton of coal, and manufacturing an extra machine as offering an extra bit of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

In the wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the working class of Hunan Province has thoroughly smashed China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises, thoroughly smashed "foreign dogma" and "foreign frameworks," and begun to abolish some unreasonable rules and regulations that shackle the workers' hands and feet. The enthusiasm and creativity of the workers have been fully unleashed, and technological innovation and technological revolution have been vigorously carried out in many factories and mines. They dare to climb the scientific and technological peak, reform many processes, and create many new technologies and new products. According to incomplete statistics from 18 units in Zhu Zhou City, more than 50 new products have been successfully developed this year; 204 major technological innovation projects have been proposed, of which 118 have been implemented.

    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署  充分发挥领导作用
    湖南省工人阶级抓革命促生产获巨大成就
    全省工交战线已派出三万多名优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻学校和其他没有搞好斗批改的单位，同时积极搞好本单位的斗批改，生产大幅度上升
    新华社长沙十四日电　湖南省的工人阶级，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，充分发挥领导作用，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了很大成就。目前，一个伟大的斗、批、改高潮正在湖南省工业交通战线蓬勃兴起，生产大幅度上升。全省工业交通战线形势空前大好，越来越好。
    经过两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗，湖南省广大革命工人粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图分裂工人阶级队伍的罪恶阴谋，全省工业交通战线革命大联合和革命三结合得到了进一步发展和巩固。百分之九十以上的中央直属和省属厂矿企业已经实现了革命三结合，专区、市、县的地方国营企业，除个别地区外，也有百分之九十以上实现了革命三结合。革命高潮推动着生产高潮。八月份，全省工业总产值比七月份增长百分之五左右；九月份比八月份又有较大幅度的增长。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席批准邀请各地工人代表到北京参加国庆观礼和亲切接见各省、市、自治区革命委员会负责同志、工人代表，给了湖南省工人阶级极大的鼓舞和教育。工人们激动地说：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。毛主席为我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气！”他们纷纷向伟大领袖毛主席献忠心，表决心，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮。广大革命工人普遍开展无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。在株洲、湘潭地区，今年以来参加工业交通企业毛泽东思想学习班学习的职工，占总人数百分之九十五以上。各地举办的学习班，都以“斗私，批修”为纲，联系实际活学活用毛泽东思想，解决了很多问题。
    目前，全省工业交通战线已派出三万多名优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻学校和其他没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，领导上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改，同时积极搞好本单位的斗、批、改。广大革命工人遵照毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的伟大教导，始终坚持以革命统帅生产。在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义黑货，认真清理阶级队伍，向一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，发动了更加猛烈的攻击，从而进一步巩固了无产阶级专政，促进了生产不断发展。
    在斗、批、改中，许多厂矿开展了回忆对比活动，大大激发了工人群众对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮阶级敌人的无比仇恨。他们把多生产一吨钢铁，多挖一吨煤炭，多造一台机器，看作是向毛主席多献一分忠心。
    湖南省工人阶级在斗、批、改高潮中，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义办企业路线，大破“洋教条”、“洋框框”，开始废除了一些束缚工人手脚的不合理的规章制度。工人群众的积极性和创造性得到了充分发挥，技术革新、技术革命在许多工矿企业蓬勃开展起来。他们敢于攀登科学技术高峰，改革了许多工艺，创造了许多新技术、新产品。据株洲市十八个单位的不完全统计，今年以来试制成功的新产品达五十多种；提出的重大技术革新项目达二百零四项，其中已经实现一百一十八项。
