British Northern Ireland's Queen's University in Belfast held a large-scale demonstration on the 16th to struggle for democratic rights. Three thousand students participated.

The demonstrators carried banners and placards with slogans demanding "freedom of speech" and other democratic rights. They marched from the school through the city center to the city hall to protest. The Northern Ireland authorities were terrified of the students' actions and hastily dispatched a large number of police to closely monitor the demonstrators.

Queen's University students had held a similar-scale demonstration on the 9th, protesting the Northern Ireland authorities' brutal suppression of the crowd that demonstrated for civil rights in Derry, the second-largest city in Northern Ireland, on the 5th.

    抗议当局暴行　争取民主权利
    北爱尔兰三千大学生举行示威
    新华社伦敦十七日电　英国北爱尔兰贝尔法斯特女王大学的三千名大学生十六日再次举行争取民主权利的大规模示威。
    示威者举着旗帜和标语牌，上面写着要求“言论自由”和其他民主权利的口号，从学校出发，穿过市中心，到市政厅示威。北爱尔兰当局对学生们的行动怕得要死，慌忙调来大批警察，严密监视示威学生。
    女王大学的学生在九日举行过同样规模的示威，抗议北爱尔兰当局残暴镇压五日在北爱尔兰第二大城市德里为争取公民权利而举行示威的群众。
