The people of the whole country warmly celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions to purge the old and take in the new, and to do a good job in rectifying and building the Party. The revolution has swept the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, China's Khrushchev, into the dustbin of history.

	New China News Agency, October 16th: The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on rectifying and building the Party and relying on the revolutionary masses have greatly inspired the working class, the broad revolutionary masses, and the PLA soldiers and officers who are actively engaged in the great struggle of criticizing and repudiating the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. The people of the whole country warmly celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Everyone says that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a new development of Marxism-Leninism on party building, a great program for the building of the proletarian party and the state power. We must fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasp the rectification and building of the Party in the struggle of criticizing and repudiating the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and build the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China even stronger. Under the leadership of the Party, we will defeat all the reactionaries at home and abroad, gradually uproot the roots of revisionism, and accomplish the great historical mission of the proletarian dictatorship.

	The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught: "A person has arteries and veins, and the blood circulates through the heart. It also goes through the lungs to breathe, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is the process of purging the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also purge the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without eliminating waste and absorbing fresh blood, the Party will lose its vigor." "Our power comes from whom? It comes from the working class, from the poor and lower-middle peasants, from the broad laboring masses who make up more than 90% of the population. We represent the proletariat, represent the people, and overthrow the enemies of the people. The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses." After the important editorial "Absorbing the Fresh Blood of the Proletariat" was published in the _Red Flag_ magazine, conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the whole country, both urban and rural, was in a state of great joy. In many cities and industrial areas, the working class and the broad laboring masses held nighttime parades and grand meetings, warmly celebrating the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Workers who had returned to their respective places from Beijing after participating in the National Day celebrations, some studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the way, and some joined the local revolutionary masses' celebration activities as soon as they got off the train. Workers in Beijing who were attending a national conference on seizing the revolution and promoting production held study and discussion sessions late into the night. Many factories, mines, and enterprises that had already started the work of rectifying and building the Party reviewed their previous work in light of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, made new plans, and checked their work.

	Revolutionary committees in many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions immediately held meetings to study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The PLA headquarters, various military branches, and the broad soldiers and officers fighting on the "three supports, two militaries" front lines held celebration meetings, seriously studied, and enthusiastically discussed. Some naval soldiers and officers on duty at the coastal defense front held meetings on the decks of their ships, warmly praising Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line and thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist party-building line.

	The broad masses of soldiers and civilians in various places warmly celebrate: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, exposed and criticized China's Khrushchev and a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the Party, swept China's Khrushchev, this traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, into the dustbin of history, smashed the revisionist clique within the Party, further consolidated the proletarian dictatorship in our country, and strengthened the leadership of the Party. The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin has become the sole leadership center of the whole Party, the whole country, and the whole army. The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, personally created by Chairman Mao, is even purer, stronger, and more united. This is the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

	Members of the revolutionary committees, the broad industrial workers, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers and officers in various places believe that Chairman Mao's teachings on "purging the old and taking in the new" deeply reflect the objective laws of class struggle and fully represent the demands and wishes of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. They say that we must resolutely expel those counter-revolutionaries and members of the exploiting classes from the Party, absorb outstanding members of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, especially advanced elements among the industrial workers, into the Party, and select vigorous Communist Party members who faithfully carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to various levels of the Party's leading organs. Only then can our Party better become "the vanguard organization of the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy, full of vigor."

	After more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of highly conscious proletarian revolutionary rebels have emerged among the broad industrial workers nationwide, and many of them eagerly hope to become glorious Communist Party members as soon as possible. The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions have been conveyed, and in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Harbin, and other cities where industrial workers are concentrated, as well as in important industrial and mining areas such as the steel city of Anshan, the Daqing Oil Field, and the Kaiping Coal Mine, the broad industrial workers are inspired and delighted. They say that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest encouragement and education for us, the working class. Only by constantly "purging the old and taking in the new" can our Party become stronger and more vigorous. The capital's Mucity Coal Mine, which has gained initial experience in rectifying and building the Party, approved a batch of outstanding proletarian revolutionary rebel fighters to join the Party on the 16th. The revolutionary committee of this mine expressed that they would definitely fully implement Chairman Mao's instructions and do an even better job in rectifying and building the Party.

	Many places' broad Communist Party members and proletarian revolutionary fighters have seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions in connection with the actual struggle between the two lines within the Party. They say, "Purging the old and taking in the new" is the class struggle within the Party. We must, through this struggle, build our Party into a proletarian political party that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They also emphasized that to implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "purging the old and taking in the new," we must, in terms of organization, expel those traitors, spies, all counter-revolutionaries, stubborn capitalist-roaders, class enemies, and degenerate elements who have clear evidence from the Party; in terms of ideology, we must thoroughly eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev's "six theories," such as the theory of the extinction of class struggle and the theory of the tamed tool, and the various manifestations of the bourgeois "self." At the same time, we must constantly absorb advanced elements of the proletariat into the Party; constantly absorb the new thoughts of the proletariat, that is, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can our Party forever maintain the strong vitality of the vanguard organization of the proletariat.

	The broad revolutionary masses in many places such as Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guizhou, Hebei, Henan, Guangxi, Shandong, and Shanxi reviewed the history of our Party's struggle and had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions on "purging the old and taking in the new." They said that the history of our Party's struggle is a history of constantly "purging the old and taking in the new" under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line.

	The Party members of the Yangjialing Party Branch, personally cultivated by Chairman Mao, once again came to the original site of the Central Hall in Yangjialing to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. An old Party member who had participated in Chairman Mao's leadership of the rectification movement in Yan'an said that it was precisely because our Party, under Chairman Mao's leadership, eliminated waste and absorbed fresh blood in those days, purified the Party organization, and ensured the great victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation. Historical practice has proven that only by constantly undergoing new metabolism can the Party organization forever maintain the revolutionary vigor of the proletariat.

	The broad proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses in Gansu, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jilin, Anhui, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Tibet said in their study and discussion of Chairman Mao's latest instructions that Chairman Mao's instructions have put forward higher requirements for every proletarian revolutionary fighter, are the greatest education, encouragement, and spur for every proletarian revolutionary fighter. To "purge the old and take in the new" in the Party organization, one must also "purge the old and take in the new" in one's own mind, arm one's mind with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fight against selfishness and repudiate revisionism, and temper oneself into a fighter who is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. All the students attending the opening ceremony of the Party-building Mao Zedong Thought study class at the First Woolen Textile Factory in Lanzhou expressed that they would turn this session of the Party-building study class into a large classroom for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with everyone looking in the mirror and finding gaps, striving to temper themselves into vanguard fighters of the proletariat.

	The working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, broad proletarian revolutionary masses, and revolutionary masses in various places warmly celebrate Chairman Mao's great instruction that "the fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to directly rely on the broad revolutionary masses," pointing out the fundamental direction of Party building and revolutionary committee building, representing the fundamental interests of the working class and the people. Workers and PLA leftist support personnel in the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory, which is carrying out the rectification and building of the Party, said that walking the mass line and opening the door for rectification is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by firmly walking the mass line can we rectify and build our Party well, maintain close contact with the masses, and deeply root ourselves among the masses; only then can our Party maintain good style, become purer, and more vigorous. The PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Shuiguan Brigade in Shuiguan Commune, Camping County, who are helping with the rectification and building of the Party, pointed out based on their practical experience that whether to rely on the masses to rectify and build the Party or to close the door to rectify and build the Party is a struggle between two lines and two ideologies. They said that the air is freshest and the nutrition is richest among the masses, where the best oxygen is. To "purge the old and take in the new" in the Party organization, it is necessary to rely on the broad revolutionary masses and carry out open-door rectification. The broad workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses also expressed that they would use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to criticize the conservative idea of believing in elections, and build our Party and revolutionary committees according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	The broad Communist Party members and revolutionary masses, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, angrily criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies on the party-building line, such as the theory of the extinction of class struggle, the theory of the tamed tool, the theory of the backwardness of the masses, the theory of entering the Party for officialdom, the theory of peace within the Party, and the theory of the fusion of public and private. They pointed out that China's Khrushchev vigorously promoted his so-called "six theories," attempting to corrupt the worker masses and our Party with revisionism, stifle the proletarian revolutionary nature of the Party and Party members, make the proletarian revolutionary party degenerate, and serve his evil plot of restoring capitalism. They expressed that they would, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and repudiate China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist party-building line, and build our Party stronger, purer, and more vigorous under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line.

    决心按照毛主席的最新指示，吐故纳新，搞好整党建党工作革命已经把中国赫鲁晓夫这个叛徒、内奸、工贼扫进了历史的垃圾堆
    新华社十六日讯　伟大领袖毛主席关于整党建党工作和依靠革命人民群众的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了正在积极投入斗、批、改伟大斗争的全国工人阶级、广大革命群众和人民解放军指战员。全国革命人民热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表。大家说，毛主席的最新指示，是马克思列宁主义建党学说的新发展，是无产阶级政党建设和政权建设的伟大纲领。我们一定要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，在斗、批、改中抓紧搞好整党建党工作，把伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党建设得更加坚强，在党的领导下战胜国内外一切反动派，逐步挖掉修正主义根子，胜利完成无产阶级专政的伟大历史使命。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导说：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”“我们的权力是谁给的？是工人阶级给的，是贫下中农给的，是占人口百分之九十以上的广大劳动群众给的。我们代表了无产阶级，代表了人民群众，打倒了人民的敌人，人民就拥护我们。共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”传达了毛主席最新指示的《红旗》杂志重要社论《吸收无产阶级的新鲜血液》发表以后，全国城乡一片欢腾。许多城市和工矿地区的工人阶级和广大劳动群众，连夜上街游行，举行盛大集会，热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表。由北京返回各地的参加国庆观礼的工人代表，有的在途中学习和讨论了毛主席的最新指示，有的一下火车就参加了当地革命群众的庆祝活动。正在北京出席全国性的抓革命促生产会议的工人，连夜举行了学习讨论会。不少已经开始整党建党工作的厂矿企业单位，对照毛主席的最新指示检查了前一段工作，作出了新的规划。
    许多省、市、自治区的革命委员会立即召开会议，学习和讨论毛主席的最新指示。人民解放军各总部、各军种、兵种和战斗在各地“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员，纷纷举行庆祝集会，认真学习和热烈座谈。正在海防前线执行任务的一些海军指战员们，在舰艇的甲板上开大会，热烈赞颂毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义建党路线。
    各地广大军民热烈欢呼：伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫等钻进党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他反革命分子，把中国赫鲁晓夫这个叛徒、内奸、工贼扫进了历史的垃圾堆，粉碎了党内的修正主义派别，进一步巩固了我国的无产阶级专政，加强了党的领导。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，已经成为全党、全国、全军唯一的领导中心。由毛主席亲手缔造的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，更加纯洁，更加坚强，更加团结了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    各地革命委员会成员、广大产业工人、革命群众和人民解放军指战员认为，毛主席关于“吐故纳新”的教导，深刻地反映了阶级斗争的客观规律，完全代表了无产阶级和广大革命群众的要求和愿望。他们说，坚决把那些反革命分子和剥削阶级分子清除出党，吸收无产阶级革命造反派中的优秀分子首先是产业工人中的先进分子入党，把忠实执行毛主席革命路线的朝气蓬勃的共产党员挑选到各级党的领导机构中去，我们的党才能更好地成为“领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”。
    经过两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，全国各地广大的产业工人中，涌现出了一大批具有高度无产阶级觉悟的优秀的造反派战士，许多人迫切希望早日成为光荣的共产党员。伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示传来，北京、上海、天津、沈阳、武汉、广州、西安、成都、重庆、哈尔滨等产业工人比较集中的城市，以及钢都鞍山、大庆油田、开滦煤矿等重要工矿地区，广大产业工人欢欣鼓舞，兴高采烈。他们说，毛主席的最新指示，是对我们工人阶级的最大鼓舞，最大教育。只有不断“吐故纳新”，我们的党才能更加壮大，更加朝气蓬勃。整党建党工作取得初步经验的首都木城涧煤矿，十六日有一批优秀的无产阶级革命造反派战士被批准入党。这个矿的革委会表示，一定要全面落实毛主席的指示，把整党建党工作搞得好上加好。
    许多地方的广大共产党员和无产阶级革命战士，联系党内两条路线斗争的实际，认真学习了毛主席的指示。他们说，“吐故纳新”，就是党内的阶级斗争。我们一定要通过这种斗争，把我们党建设成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级政党。他们还强调说，要落实毛主席关于“吐故纳新”的指示，就要坚持在组织上把那些证据确凿的叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子、顽固不化的走资派、阶级异己分子、蜕化变质分子清除出党；在思想上坚持把中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“驯服工具论”等“六论”的流毒，把资产阶级“私”字的各种表现，彻底清除出去。同时，要不断吸收无产阶级的先进分子入党；不断吸收无产阶级的新思想，就是用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。只有这样，我们的党才能永远保持无产阶级先锋队组织的强大生命力。
    陕西、湖南、江西、福建、贵州、河北、河南、广西、山东、山西等许多地方的广大革命群众回顾了我们党的斗争历史，对毛主席的“吐故纳新”的指示，有了更加深刻的理解。他们说，我们党的斗争历史，就是在毛主席的无产阶级建党路线指引下，不断“吐故纳新”的历史。
    毛主席亲自培育起来的延安杨家岭党支部的党员们，又一次来到杨家岭中央大礼堂原地学习了毛主席的最新指示。曾经参加过毛主席在延安时领导的整党运动的老党员说，正因为我们的党当年在毛主席领导下清除了废料，吸收了新鲜血液，更加纯洁了党的组织，才保证了抗日战争和解放战争的伟大胜利。历史的实践证明，党组织只有不断地进行新陈代谢，才能永远保持无产阶级的革命朝气。
    甘肃、江苏、浙江、吉林、安徽、青海、内蒙古、宁夏、云南、新疆、西藏等地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在学习讨论毛主席的最新指示时说，毛主席的指示，对每一个无产阶级革命战士提出了更高的要求，是对每一个无产阶级革命战士的最大教育，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。党组织要“吐故纳新”，自己思想上也要“吐故纳新”，要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装头脑，斗私批修，把自己锻炼成为永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战士。兰州第一毛纺织厂正在参加建党毛泽东思想学习班开学典礼的全体学员表示，要把这期建党学习班办成落实毛主席最新指示的大课堂，人人照镜子，个个找差距，努力把自己锻炼成为无产阶级的先锋战士。
    各地工人阶级、贫下中农、广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，热烈欢呼毛主席的“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众”的伟大指示，指出了党的建设和革命委员会建设的根本方向，代表了工人阶级、人民群众的根本利益。正在进行整党建党的北京制药厂的工人和解放军支左人员说，走群众路线，开门整党，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。只有坚决走群众路线，才能把我们的党整好建好，和群众保持密切的联系，深深扎根于群众之中；才能使我们的党保持优良作风，更加纯洁，更加朝气蓬勃。正在营口县水源公社水源大队帮助进行整党建党工作的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和大队革命干部、贫下中农，根据他们的实践体会指出，是依靠群众整党建党，还是关起门来整党建党，这是两条路线、两种思想的斗争。他们说，群众中空气最新鲜，营养最丰富，那里有最好的氧气。党组织要“吐故纳新”，就必须依靠广大革命人民群众，实行开门整党。广大工人、贫下中农和革命干部、革命群众还表示，要以毛主席的最新指示为武器，批判迷信选举的保守思想，按照毛主席的革命路线建设我们的党和革命委员会。
    广大共产党员和革命群众在学习毛主席的最新指示的时候，愤怒地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在建党路线上推行的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“驯服工具论”、“群众落后论”、“入党做官论”、“党内和平论”、“公私溶化论”等反革命修正主义谬论。他们指出，中国赫鲁晓夫大肆推行他的所谓“六论”，就是妄图用修正主义来腐蚀工人群众，腐蚀我们的党，扼杀党和党员的无产阶级革命性，使无产阶级的革命党蜕化变质，为他复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋服务。他们表示，一定要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义建党路线，在毛主席的无产阶级建党路线指引下，把我们的党建设得更加坚强，更加纯洁，更加朝气蓬勃。
