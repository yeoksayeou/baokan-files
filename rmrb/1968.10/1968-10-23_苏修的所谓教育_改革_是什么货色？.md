While our country's proletarian educational revolution is being carried out in depth, the Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly propagates their so-called "higher education is in the midst of reform."

How do the Soviet revisionist cliques "reform" their education? According to their own statements, it is to "use the ruble to serve higher education," to let the ruble "properly propose the practical requirements for higher schools that are constantly changing and becoming more complex," to let the ruble "prompt higher schools to face life." In short, "the ruble takes the lead" is the basic guideline for the current so-called educational "reform" of the Soviet revisionists.

Reform in the ideological realm always serves a certain economic base and political system, and always reflects the interests and demands of a certain class. Our country's proletarian educational revolution is a necessary result of the deepening development of our socialist revolution, an important measure to further consolidate the socialist system and strengthen proletarian dictatorship, reflecting the interests and demands of the working class and the broad masses of laboring people. The so-called educational "reform" of the Soviet revisionists, however, is the inevitable result of the Soviet revisionists' full-scale restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. It is a means for the Soviet revisionists to further promote the capitalist nature of the economy and strengthen the revisionist rule, completely reflecting the interests and demands of the small privileged stratum riding on the heads of the broad masses of laboring people in the Soviet Union.

After the Soviet revisionist clique came to power, while turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship and socialist economy into capitalist economy, they also merged with Western culture in the ideological realm. The education in the Soviet Union has actually begun to "reform." In recent years, the Soviet revisionists have been frantically promoting the "new economic system" at home, striving to strengthen fascist dictatorship; abroad, they have been hastening to collude with U.S. imperialism, attempting to redivide the world. They have completely degenerated into social imperialism and social fascism. To adapt to the above situation, the Soviet revisionist clique has completely torn off the remaining facade of the past in the field of education, and blatantly uses the principle of "the ruble takes the lead" to carry out "reform."

The great revolutionary teachers Marx and Engels pointed out in the "Communist Manifesto": "The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers." In capitalist society, money rules everything, and education is no exception. The Soviet revisionists want to "use the ruble to serve higher education," which is to let the ruble control the entire education, making the entire education thoroughly capitalist.

The Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev once said that the Soviet revisionists want to "recruit cadres from experts trained by higher schools to engage in economic work, party work, state work, diplomatic work, military work, and all social activities." Kosygin also said: higher schools are for training "experts and production organizers." It is very clear that the educational policy of the Soviet revisionists is to "train" the "experts" needed to maintain their revisionist rule. Now, the Soviet revisionists use the principle of "the ruble takes the lead" to "reform" education, actually turning schools into markets for free competition to pursue rubles. The students "trained" in such schools think of rubles while studying, and after graduation, they still think of rubles. For rubles, they can do anything, and for rubles, they can sell themselves. The Soviet revisionists want to "train" such a group of people who are only after rubles, a batch of commodities that can be freely bought and sold with rubles. In this way, the Soviet revisionist clique can buy the tools to serve their rule and obtain the "successors" to their revisionist cause.

Chairman Mao often teaches us: revolutionary parties and revolutionary people must repeatedly undergo education from both positive and negative aspects, and through comparison and contrast, they can be tempered to maturity and have the guarantee of victory.

The so-called educational "reform" of the Soviet revisionist clique is a stark contrast to our country's proletarian educational revolution. This makes the Chinese people and revolutionary people all over the world more clearly recognize that the proletarian educational revolution in our country, under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, has a profound and far-reaching significance for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism. The Soviet people and youth with the glorious revolutionary tradition of October Revolution can also more clearly recognize the heinous crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique in restoring capitalism through comparison. They will definitely rise up in rebellion and overthrow the reactionary rule of revisionism.

    苏修的所谓教育“改革”是什么货色？
    河南开封师范学院　任反修
    正当我国的无产阶级教育革命深入开展的时候，苏修叛徒集团无耻地大肆宣扬他们的“高等学校正处于改革之中”。
    苏修叛徒集团是怎样来“改革”他们的教育的呢？根据他们自己的说法，就是要“把卢布拿来为高等教育服务”，让卢布“恰当地提出实践对高等学校不断变化和越来越复杂的要求”，让卢布“促使高等学校面向生活”。总之，“卢布挂帅”是苏修当前的所谓教育“改革”的基本纲领。
    意识形态领域中的改革，总是为一定的经济基础和政治制度服务的，总是反映了一定的阶级的利益与要求。我国的无产阶级教育革命，是我国社会主义革命深入发展的必然结果，是进一步巩固社会主义制度和加强无产阶级专政的重要措施，反映了工人阶级和广大劳动人民的利益与要求。而苏修的所谓教育“改革”，则是苏修在苏联全面复辟资本主义的必然结果，是苏修为了进一步促使经济资本主义化和加强修正主义统治的一种手段，完全反映了骑在苏联广大劳动人民头上的一小撮特权阶层的利益与要求。
    苏修叛徒集团上台后，在把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政、把社会主义经济变成资本主义经济的同时，在意识形态方面也同西方文化合流。苏联的教育，实际上早已开始“改革”了。近年来，苏修在国内拚命推行“经济新体制”，竭力加强法西斯专政；在国外加紧同美帝国主义勾结，妄图重新瓜分世界。它已经彻底堕落成为社会帝国主义和社会法西斯主义。为了与上述情况相适应，苏修叛徒集团在教育方面也就彻底撕掉过去那点残余的伪装，赤裸裸地用“卢布挂帅”的原则来进行“改革”。
    伟大的革命导师马克思、恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中指出：“资产阶级抹去了一切向来受人尊敬和令人敬畏的职业的灵光。它把医生、律师、教士、诗人和学者变成了它出钱招雇的雇佣劳动者。”在资本主义社会里，金钱主宰一切，教育也不例外。苏修要“把卢布拿来为高等教育服务”，也就是让卢布支配整个教育，使整个教育彻头彻尾资本主义化。
    苏修头目勃列日涅夫说过，苏修要“从经过高等学校培养的专家中吸收从事经济工作、党的工作、国家工作、外交工作、军事工作和从事一切社会活动的干部”。柯西金也说：高等学校是培养“专家和生产组织者”的。很明白，苏修的教育方针就是为了“培养”维护他们修正主义统治所需要的“专家”。现在苏修用“卢布挂帅”的原则“改革”教育，实际上使学校变成为了追求卢布而进行自由竞争的市场。在这样的学校里“培养”出来的学生，念书时想的是卢布，毕业后想的也是卢布，为了卢布什么都可以干，为了卢布可以把自己出卖。苏修想要“培养”的，就是那么一伙唯卢布是图的人物，就是那么一批用卢布可以自由买卖的商品。这样，苏修叛徒集团就可以收买到为他们的统治效劳的工具，得到继承他们修正主义事业的“接班人”。
    毛主席经常教导我们：革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。
    苏修叛徒集团所谓的教育“改革”，同我国的无产阶级教育革命是一个鲜明的对照。这使中国人民和全世界革命人民更加清楚地认识到，在伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导下进行的我国无产阶级教育革命，对于反修防修有着多么深远而重大的意义。具有十月革命光荣革命传统的苏联人民和苏联青年从对比中也可更加清楚地认识到苏修叛徒集团复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他们一定会奋起造反，推翻修正主义的反动统治。
