	Brazilian Communist Party Organ Publishes Article Warmly Congratulating Our National Day and the Whole Country Turning Red
	China Everywhere Flies the Victory Banner of the Cultural Revolution

	Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: Rio de Janeiro News: The Brazilian Communist Party Central Committee's organ, the "Worker's Class Newspaper," in its recently published 24th issue, published an article titled "Long Live People's China!" warmly congratulating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the great victory of the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province).

	The article states: On October 1st, the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world, with hearts full of joy and excitement, celebrated the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The once oppressed billion Chinese people, after a long period of heroic struggle, finally gained freedom and complete independence, paving the way for the construction of a new society. The broad laboring masses of China have dealt a devastating blow to the imperialist system, and thus, the national liberation movements of the colonies and dependent countries have entered a new era.

	The article emphasizes: "The victory of the Chinese revolution in 1949 is the victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. For decades, the Chinese people have attempted to free themselves from oppression through various means. However, they did not achieve their wishes. Only under the guidance of the powerful proletarian doctrine enriched by the genius of Mao Zedong, did they overthrow the three great mountains weighing heavily on this nation—feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism—and establish the People's Republic of China."

	The article states: The Chinese proletariat, peasants, and progressive intellectuals, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought on "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," adopted armed struggle as the sole means of victory, establishing a powerful People's Liberation Army.

	The article states: "The People's Liberation Army, which has performed glorious deeds in countless battles, has mastered the most revolutionary military thought, closely linked with the masses, and one after another, defeated the numerous Kuomintang armies equipped by American imperialism. Without establishing this new type of army, the People's Republic of China would not have come into being.

	"The Chinese Communist Party, tempered by the most intense class struggle, has become the leading force of the liberation struggle. It has rallied the most awakened and combat-ready elements, especially workers and poor peasants, gaining the support of the broad masses and greatly raising the political awareness of the people. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party has become the vanguard of the revolution. It has opposed and eliminated rightist and 'leftist' tendencies within its ranks, safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to the conditions of China."

	The article states: "In the 19 years of people's power, China has achieved tremendous successes. It has developed people's communes, organizing hundreds of millions of peasants into advanced production systems; it has established a modern industry based on advanced technology; it has mastered the secrets of atomic energy; it has ensured the welfare of the laboring people and promoted universal education. However, the greatest, most outstanding, and most historically significant achievement, undoubtedly, is the launch of the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution represents a new stage of the socialist revolution. In the lives of people in various countries, few social movements have had such depth. No other movement has mobilized so many people. The Cultural Revolution has dealt a fatal blow to modern revisionism, smashing the attempts of those who sought to restore capitalism in China."

	The article points out: The 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is being held at a time when the Cultural Revolution has achieved comprehensive victory. In this revolution, the revolutionary committees, a new form of state power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province). Thus, all over China, the victory banner of the Cultural Revolution is flying. Now, the socialist state power is firmly in the hands of the people, in the hands of the revolutionary factions who have been tested and are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese people are advancing towards a brilliant future.

	The article states: "People's China now enjoys unquestionable prestige and influence in the international arena. People of all countries look up to this great socialist country in Asia with admiration and respect. It is a strong bastion in the struggle against American imperialism and the main base of the revolutionary movement. Unlike the Soviet revisionists who have betrayed the socialist cause and shamelessly colluded with the American monopolies, China remains faithful to the revolution and to proletarian internationalism, fearless of the threats from the warmongers in the White House and their accomplices in the Kremlin. It bravely defends socialism, people's democracy, and the independence of the peoples of all countries. The example of China illuminates the path to liberation for the exploited and oppressed peoples of all continents."

	The article concludes: At this 19th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, the magnificent image of Chairman Mao Zedong shines even brighter. Chairman Mao Zedong, as a great Marxist-Leninist thinker, has opened up new paths in all aspects, which have been proven by practice to be universal truths, making the most precious contributions to the treasury of Marxism-Leninism.

    巴西共产党机关报发表文章热烈祝贺我国庆和全国一片红
    中国到处飘扬着文化大革命胜利旗帜
    新华社十四日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西共产党中央委员会机关报《工人阶级报》在最近出版的第二十四期上发表题为《人民中国万岁！》的文章，热烈祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年和中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）全部成立革命委员会的伟大胜利。
    文章说：十月一日，中国人民和全世界革命人民，怀着十分欢欣鼓舞的心情，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年。从前遭受残酷压迫的亿万中国人民，经过长期的英勇奋斗，终于取得了自由和完全的独立，为建设一个新社会开辟了道路。中国广大劳动群众，给了帝国主义体系一个毁灭性的打击，由此，各殖民地和附属国民族解放运动便进入了一个新时代。
    文章强调指出：“一九四九年中国革命的胜利，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的胜利。几十年来，中国人民曾经试图通过各种不同的解决办法，来摆脱百年来的压迫。但是，他们没有达到自己的愿望。只是在由毛泽东天才地丰富了的强大无产阶级学说的指引下，才推翻了沉重地压在这个民族身上的三座大山——封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本，建立了中华人民共和国。”
    文章说：中国无产阶级、农民和进步知识分子，在毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想的教导下，采取了武装斗争这一克敌制胜的唯一手段，建立了强大的人民解放军。
    文章说：“在千百次战斗中立下光荣业绩的人民解放军，掌握了最革命的军事思想，紧密联系群众，一个又一个地战胜了美帝国主义装备的众多的国民党军队。如果不建立这支新型的军队，就不会出现中华人民共和国。
    “中国共产党经过最剧烈的阶级斗争的锻炼，成了解放斗争的领导力量。它集结了最觉醒、最有战斗力的分子、特别是工人和贫农，取得了广大群众的支持，大大提高了人民的政治觉悟。在毛泽东领导下，中国共产党成了革命的先锋队。它在自己队伍中反对并清除了右的和‘左’的倾向，保卫了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用于中国的条件。”
    文章说：“在人民政权的十九年中，中国取得了巨大的成就。它发展了人民公社，把亿万农民按高级生产制度组织起来；它建立了以先进技术为基础的现代工业；掌握了原子能的秘密；保障了劳动人民的福利和普及教育。但是，最伟大的、最突出的、具有重大历史意义的成就，毫无疑问是开展了无产阶级文化大革命。无产阶级文化大革命代表了社会主义革命的一个新阶段。在各国人民生活中，社会运动的规模很少有这样的深度。任何其他运动都没有发动起为数这样广的人民。文化革命给了现代修正主义致命的打击，粉碎了那些妄想在中国复辟资本主义的企图。”
    文章指出：中华人民共和国十九周年国庆，是在无产阶级文化大革命夺取全面胜利的时候举行的。在这一革命中出现的、作为无产阶级专政国家政权新形式的三结合革命委员会，在中国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）全部成立起来。这样，全中国到处都飘扬着无产阶级文化大革命的胜利旗帜。现在，社会主义政权已牢牢地掌握在人民手中，掌握在经过考验的、忠于毛泽东思想的革命派手中。中国人民正迎着光辉灿烂的前途迈进。
    文章说：“人民中国现在在国际上享有无可争辩的声誉和威望。世界各国人民怀着钦佩和崇敬的心情，仰望着这个亚洲伟大的社会主义国家，它是反对美帝国主义的斗争的强大堡垒，是革命运动的主要根据地。同背叛社会主义事业、无耻地同美国垄断集团勾结在一起的苏联修正主义者相反，中国坚持忠于革命和忠于无产阶级国际主义，不怕白宫好战分子及其克里姆林宫同伙的威胁。它勇敢捍卫社会主义、人民民主和各国人民的独立。中国的榜样照亮了所有各大陆被剥削被压迫人民走向解放的道路。”
    文章最后写道：在此中华人民共和国十九周年的时候，毛泽东主席的杰出形象显得更加崇高。毛泽东主席作为伟大的马克思列宁主义思想家，在各方面都开创了已被实践证明为普遍真理的新道路，对马克思列宁主义宝库作出了最珍贵的贡献。
