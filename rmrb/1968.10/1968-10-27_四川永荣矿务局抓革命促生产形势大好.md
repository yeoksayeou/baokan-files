The revolutionary cadres and workers of the Yongrong Mining Bureau in Sichuan Province, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have been vigorously advancing the revolution and steadily increasing production. Since the third quarter, the monthly coal output of the entire mine has been rising, and the daily output in the first half of October has increased by 1.2 times compared to September. Recently, they have set a new record for the highest daily coal output since the mine's establishment.

Yongrong Mining Bureau is one of the large coal mines in Sichuan Province. Under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel stationed at the mine, the revolutionary cadres and workers of the entire mine have closely followed the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasping class struggle and not relaxing, and have smashed the plots of a handful of class enemies to sabotage revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Now, revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups have been established in all the mines under the jurisdiction of the entire mine area, effectively promoting the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committees at various levels, following Chairman Mao's teachings, they have carried forward the fine tradition of closely linking with the masses, sending the majority of their members to the production front lines to study, work, and criticize and transform themselves together with the workers, continuously promoting the development of the revolution and production.

The helmsman steers the ship, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. After the joyous news of the great leader Chairman Mao's warm reception of worker representatives from all over the country who participated in the National Day celebrations reached the Yongrong Mining Bureau, it greatly inspired and strengthened the entire working class of the mine area. The revolutionary cadres and workers of the entire bureau, with boundless loyalty and deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, have further launched a mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, further developing the great situation of revolution and production.

    四川永荣矿务局抓革命促生产形势大好
    四川省永荣矿务局广大革命职工在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，把革命搞得热气腾腾，生产蒸蒸日上。第三季度以来，全矿原煤产量月月上升，十月上半月日产量比九月份上升一点二倍。最近又创造了建矿以来原煤日产量的最高纪录。
    永荣矿务局是四川省大型煤矿之一。在省革委会的领导下和驻矿解放军支左人员的大力帮助下，这个矿的广大革命职工，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争不转向，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人破坏革命大联合和革命三结合的阴谋。现在，全矿区所属各个矿井都建立了革命委员会或革命领导小组，有力地推动了斗、批、改的高潮。
    各级革委会成立后，遵照毛主席的教导，发扬密切联系群众的优良作风，抽出大多数成员深入生产第一线，和工人同学习、同劳动、同斗私批修，推动了革命和生产的不断发展。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。伟大领袖毛主席在北京亲切接见参加国庆观礼的全国各地工人代表的喜讯传到永荣矿务局以后，给全矿区的广大工人阶级以巨大的鼓舞和力量。全局革命职工怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，进一步掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，进一步发展了革命和生产的大好形势。
