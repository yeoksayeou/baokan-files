	Workers in Kitakyushu, Japan, Hold Rally with Red Flags

	BEIJING, Oct. 19 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the East Is Red News Agency, 300 workers in Kitakyushu, Japan, held a rally on Oct. 19 to resolutely oppose the unloading of ammunition from the U.S. military cargo ship "Shagumaru." They strongly supported the patriotic just struggle of the port workers in Moji who refused to unload the ammunition.

	The port workers in Moji have been on strike for three days since Oct. 17, opposing the entry of the U.S. military cargo ship carrying ammunition into the port, preventing the unloading of the ammunition. On the morning of Oct. 19, 1,500 workers engaged in transportation at the port also went on strike to support the port workers' struggle.

	On the morning of Oct. 19, workers from various parts of Kitakyushu, holding high red flags, held a rally full of fighting spirit. They faced the "Shagumaru," which was anchored at sea, and shouted angrily, "U.S. military cargo ship, get out of the port!" They also strongly demanded the removal of the U.S. military arsenal in Yamada, Kitakyushu.

	A worker representative said at the rally, "While the U.S. imperialists are playing with so-called peace talks, they are frantically transporting weapons to Vietnam. This fact clearly shows that the so-called peace of U.S. imperialism is a thoroughgoing fraud. We will not allow even one ton of weapons used for the aggression against Vietnam to be unloaded in Japan. We will fight to the end for victory."

	During the rally, the workers boarded a ship flying a red flag and held a sea demonstration near the U.S. military cargo ship. The workers on the ship shouted, "Yankees, get out!"

	After the rally, the leader of the Hyogo-Moji Branch of the All-Japan Port Workers' Union, Ikio Iked, told the East Is Red News Agency reporter that with the support and sympathy of the broad masses of people in Fukuoka Prefecture, the struggle against turning Moji Port into a U.S. aggression base is rapidly developing. The U.S. military authorities are plotting to directly use U.S. soldiers to forcibly load and unload, "but we will fight to the end and drive the U.S. military cargo ship carrying weapons out of Moji Port."

	On Oct. 6, workers, peasants, and students from all over Japan held rallies and marches, demanding the withdrawal of all U.S. military bases in Japan and the abolition of the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

    坚决支持门司港码头工人拒绝为美侵略军卸下弹药的正义斗争
    日本北九州市工人高举红旗举行集会
    新华社十九日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本北九州市三百名工人十九日举行集会，坚决反对从美国军用货船“沙格木号”卸下弹药，坚决支持门司港码头工人拒绝卸下弹药的爱国正义斗争。
    门司港码头工人从十七日起已经举行了三天的罢工，反对运载弹药的美军货船开入港内，使美军弹药无法卸下。十九日早上，一千五百名在港口进行运输工作的工人，也举行罢工，支持码头工人的斗争。
    十九日早上，北九州各地工人，高举红旗，斗志昂扬地举行集会。他们面向停泊在海面上的“沙格木号”愤怒地高呼：“美军货船滚出港口去！”他们还强烈要求撤除贮藏美国军火的北九州市山田军火库。
    一位工人代表在集会上说：“美帝国主义在玩弄所谓和谈的同时，狂热地向越南运输军火。这个事实清楚地表明，美帝国主义的所谓和平是彻头彻尾的大骗局。我们绝不允许在日本卸下那怕一吨为侵略越南使用的军火。我们要坚决斗争到胜利。”
    在集会进行中，工人们乘坐一艘挂着红旗的船到美国军用货船附近举行了海上示威。船上的工人高呼：“美国佬滚出去！”
    会后，全日本港湾工会下关门司支部领导人池田寅夫对东方通讯社记者发表谈话说，在福冈县广大人民群众的支持和同情下，反对把门司港变成美国侵略基地的斗争正在迅速发展。美军当局正在阴谋直接动用美国士兵强行装卸，“但是，我们将坚持斗争到底，把运军火的美军货船从门司港赶出去。”（附图片）
