Great Leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received all the representatives of the National Railway and Transportation Conference. The broad revolutionary cadres and workers of the Xi'an Railway Bureau transformed Chairman Mao's and Vice Chairman Lin's warm reception into a great driving force, took class struggle as the key, vigorously carried out the revolution, and vigorously promoted production, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

The Xi'an Railway Bureau's entire line is a crucial hub for railway transportation in Southwest and Northwest China, playing an important role in China's railway transportation front. For a long time, class struggle here has been extremely sharp and complex. Khrushchev of China and his agents in the railway system have been crazily promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line here; during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies created disturbances, attempting to sabotage railway transportation to disrupt the revolution and production. The broad revolutionary cadres and workers of the Xi'an Railway Bureau, remembering Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, smashed their evil plots, and made the revolutionary and production situation of the entire bureau better and better. By the eve of National Day, all primary units of the entire bureau had established revolutionary committees, achieving a red situation throughout the bureau. Various production indicators have significantly increased compared to before. In September compared to June, the average daily car loading volume increased by 60%, the unloading rate increased by 50%, and the freight car turnover time was greatly shortened.

As the struggle-criticism-reform high tide deepens, the revolutionary committees at all levels of the Xi'an Railway Bureau mobilized the broad revolutionary cadres and workers to thoroughly criticize various unreasonable regulations and systems, effectively promoting the development of transportation and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency from Nanchang, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers of the Nanchang Railway Bureau, with high revolutionary spirits, strived to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, vigorously grasped class struggle, and promoted the entire bureau's production to present a thriving new situation. Since this year, transportation and production have continued to rise. In the third quarter compared to the same period last year, the number of cars loaded increased by 130%, the volume of goods shipped increased by 134.5%, the freight car turnover time was shortened by 56.2%, and the freight car daily kilometers increased by 29.9%. Due to the rapid improvement of the entire bureau's transportation efficiency, it ensured the timely delivery of major materials such as timber, coal, grain, and ore to various parts of the country, strongly supporting the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Revolutionary criticism is the driving force for the vigorous development of revolution and production. The broad revolutionary cadres and workers of the Nanchang Railway Bureau, following the teachings of Great Leader Chairman Mao on "our important task on the ideological front is to carry out criticism of revisionism" and "never forget class struggle," used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism. Through the revolutionary criticism of Khrushchev of China and his agents in the railway system who promoted the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "material incentives," "bonus as the commander," and "technology first," they effectively mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary cadres and workers to grasp the revolution and promote production. The more than 800 workers of the Fifth Engineering Section of Nanchang, scattered across more than 20 work points, insisted on carrying out revolutionary criticism at the construction site. Under the promotion of revolutionary criticism, this section completed the task ahead of schedule every month in the second quarter. The broad crew members of the locomotive department combined sky-high enthusiasm with a scientific attitude through criticism, vigorously carried out the "pull more and run faster" movement. Since this year, the entire bureau's locomotives have overloaded by more than 4,200 times, with a total of more than 130,000 tons of goods overloaded, equivalent to opening more than 900 trains. The broad revolutionary cadres and workers fiercely criticized Khrushchev of China's "expert line" and "crawling philosophy," fully displayed their wisdom, pooled their strengths, and vigorously carried out technological innovation and technological revolution. The entire bureau has had 68 major innovation projects since this year.

As the struggle-criticism-reform deepens, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers of the Nanchang Railway Bureau also broke through many unreasonable regulations and systems, further promoting production.

According to Xinhua News Agency from Harbin, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the great situation of the country turning red, vigorously grasped the revolution, vigorously promoted production, making the entire bureau's revolutionary atmosphere surging, and transportation and production continuing to rise. In the third quarter, the number of cars loaded by this bureau increased by an average of 325 cars per day compared to the first half of the year, with the loading of major materials such as coal, grain, and timber increasing month by month. The transportation order is also good, with the punctuality rate of passenger and freight trains consistently maintained at a relatively high level.

The broad revolutionary cadres and workers of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau, while sending a large number of outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter all middle and primary schools in the entire bureau and "old and difficult" units that have not done a good job in struggle-criticism-reform, the revolutionary cadres and workers who remained at the transportation and production posts bravely shouldered the heavy responsibilities. Under the strong help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist troops and the leadership of the bureau's revolutionary committee, they closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, vigorously grasped revolutionary criticism, vigorously grasped struggle-criticism-reform, used Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, transform everything, and promote everything, effectively promoting the development of revolution and production.
