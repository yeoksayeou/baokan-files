	Good Teacher, Good Example

	Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team member and veteran worker Rong Jixi, upon arriving at Henan Luoyang Fourth Middle School, immediately began conducting thorough and detailed investigations and research. She noticed that some revolutionary youngsters had a strong tendency towards liberalism, which made her very anxious. She was determined to help them overcome this bad habit. The worker propaganda team established a Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the class, Rong Jixi first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." She spoke very seriously, reading a section and then explaining it with her own personal experiences, followed by discussions with the students.

	Rong Jixi was born into a poor peasant family. Before she turned ten, both her parents were forced to death by the landlord, and she was forced to work in a tobacco factory as a child laborer. Excessive labor often made her unconsciously fall asleep. Whenever this happened, the ruthless capitalist would secretly use paper soaked in oil, light it on fire, and stuff it into her neck, calling it "neck lamp." Even now, she still has a scar on her neck. Her blood and tears stirred up the students' deep hatred for the old society. The veteran worker's every word and deed after arriving at the school further educated them deeply.

	Rong Jixi is nearly sixty years old. According to past regulations, she should have retired long ago. She heard Chairman Mao's great call to "carry out the proletarian educational revolution, which must be led by the working class and must have the participation of the working masses," and she was so excited that she couldn't sleep all night. She thought, "I have no education, I am just an uneducated person. Teaching the youngsters about class education and talking about the past hardships is something I can do." The next day, as soon as it was light, she went to the factory revolutionary committee to request to join the worker propaganda team. The factory revolutionary committee approved her request. As soon as she arrived at the school, Rong Jixi busied herself hanging Chairman Mao's portrait and Chairman Mao's quotations in the classrooms. Then, she conducted investigations and research, identified problems, and solved them promptly. She saw that some students had not been to school for a long time, so she braved the rain and mud, running from house to house, doing ideological work with the students' parents on one hand, and sincerely talking with the students on the other, urging them to return to school and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Rong Jixi was not highly educated and was worried that she might not be able to teach well and complete the glorious task given to her by the great leader Chairman Mao. She often stayed up until one or two in the morning preparing her lectures, and as soon as it was light, she would get up and practice her lectures in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. Even though she was so old, she never missed a single morning exercise with everyone.

	Rong Jixi's actions deeply educated the students. They saw from her the working class's loyalty to Chairman Mao, saw the working class's exemplary actions in strictly carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, saw the profound significance of Chairman Mao's great call for the worker propaganda team to stay in the school for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and forever lead the school, and saw the gap between themselves and the working class. The students all praised her as a "good leader, good teacher, good example" and resolved to learn from her, humbly accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and strive to become qualified successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    好老师  好榜样
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员、老工人荣记喜，一到河南漯河第四中学，就做深入细致的调查研究工作。她看到部分革命小将自由主义作风比较浓厚，心里很着急，决心帮助他们克服这种不良作风。工人宣传队办起了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，荣记喜首先组织大家学习毛主席的光辉著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》。她讲得非常认真，念一段，结合自己的亲身经历讲一段，然后和学生们一起讨论。
    荣记喜出身于贫苦农民家庭，不满十岁父母都被地主逼死了，被迫到一个烟厂里当童工。过度的劳累，经常使她不知不觉就昏睡过去。每到这时，杀人不眨眼的资本家就偷偷地用纸沾上油，点着火放进她脖子里，还起名叫做“脖眨灯”。直到现在她脖子上还有一个伤疤。她的血泪控诉，激起了学生们对旧社会的无比愤恨。这位老工人到校以后的一言一行，更使他们受到了深刻的教育。
    荣记喜年近六十，按过去的规定，早该退休了。她听到毛主席发出“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的伟大号召，兴奋得一夜没合上眼。她想：“我没文化，是个大老粗，给小将们进行阶级教育，讲讲过去的苦还是可以的。”第二天天刚亮，她就到厂革委会要求参加工人宣传队。厂革委会批准了她的请求。一到学校，荣记喜就忙着在教室张贴毛主席像和毛主席语录，接着，就进行调查研究，发现问题，及时解决。她看到有的学生长期不到校，就冒雨踏泥，东奔西跑，深入各家各户，一面做学生家长的思想工作，一面满腔热忱地找学生谈心，动员他们回校搞好斗、批、改。荣记喜文化水平不高，担心讲课讲不好，完不成伟大领袖毛主席交给的光荣任务，经常在深夜一两点钟，还一个人忙着准备讲稿，天刚亮就又起床，站在毛主席像前练习讲课。她年纪那么大了，早晨大家出操，她一次也没缺过。
    荣记喜的表现深深地教育了学生们，他们从她身上，看到了工人阶级对毛主席的赤胆忠心，看到了工人阶级不折不扣地执行毛主席最新指示的模范行动，看到了毛主席的“工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校”这一伟大号召的深远意义，看到了自己同工人阶级的差距。学生们都纷纷赞扬她是“好领导、好老师、好榜样”，决心向她学习，虚心接受工农兵的再教育，认真搞好斗、批、改，努力做一个合格的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。　             向东辉
