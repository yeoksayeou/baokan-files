Newspaper of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) *Pioneer* publishes an article celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China

Socialist China stands at the forefront of the world revolutionary movement

In the past 19 years, China has grown stronger, and the victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the revolutionary people of the world

New China News Agency Melbourne October 4th

The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ *Pioneer* published an article titled "People of the World Celebrate China's National Day" on the 3rd, celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The article says: "This week, the oppressed people of the world are celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China together with the Chinese people.

"In these 19 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao Zedong at its helm, China has grown stronger and stronger.

"Today, 700 million people and their proletarian state stand as a powerful socialist fortress. They stand at the forefront of the world revolutionary movement."

The article says: "When the first clouds of revisionism appeared on the horizon, China raised high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. The struggle between the two lines within the communist movement became public on a global scale. Everyone was affected. The path to socialism and the defeat of imperialism—is it towards 'peaceful coexistence' (which is class collaboration) or towards conducting and developing armed struggle against imperialism? This is a fundamental question.

"The entire experience of the world revolutionary movement against capitalism, from the Paris Commune to the glorious October Revolution and the world-shaking Chinese Revolution, clearly shows that only through armed struggle against the exploiting classes can human liberation be achieved.

"Only by smashing the bourgeois state machine—whose core is the armed forces—can the working class and laboring people establish their own power."

The article says: "In contemporary times, Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist. He has developed Marxism-Leninism in all aspects. In the global struggle against revisionism, Mao Zedong's theoretical summation of the Chinese revolution has been highly regarded. Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path to socialism for the peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the revolutionary theory of our times—without this revolutionary theory, there is no revolution. Hundreds of millions of people are acting according to this revolutionary theory. Because this revolutionary theory meets their urgent needs.

"Mao Zedong's words are so simple, so profound and correct! He said: 'Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people.' 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun'; 'Revolutionary war is a people's war, and only by mobilizing the masses can a war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can a war be waged.'"

The article says: "This week, hundreds of millions of people outside China are also celebrating the festival of China's liberation. This brings them great personal joy, because China is a great symbol of the immense power of the people.

"China celebrates its national day while crushing the Chinese Khrushchovites and achieving a great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The weapon used to crush the Chinese Khrushchovites is revolutionary Mao Zedong Thought.

"Around the world, revisionists are wavering under the blows of the revolution. They are more divided than ever before." The article states: "The great victory that China is celebrating is also a great victory for the revolutionary people of the world. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

"Long live the People's Republic of China!

"Long live the Communist Party of China, tempered and tested in struggle!

"Wishing the great leader of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, eternal life!

"Long live Marxism-Leninism!"

    澳共（马列）《先锋报》撰文庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年
    社会主义中国站在世界革命运动前列
    十九年来中国日益强大，中国人民的胜利也是世界革命人民的胜利
    新华社墨尔本四日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》三日发表题为《世界人民祝贺中国国庆节》的文章，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    文章说：“世界上被压迫人民本周同中国人民一道庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    “在这十九年中，在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，中国日益强大。
    “今天，七亿人民和他们的无产阶级国家作为强大的社会主义堡垒屹立着。他们站在世界革命运动的前列。”
    文章说：“在天边最初出现修正主义的乌云的时候，中国高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜。共产主义运动内部两条路线的斗争在世界范围内公开化了。每一个人都受到影响。走向社会主义和打败帝国主义的道路是以‘和平共处’（这是阶级合作）为方向呢，还是以进行和发展反帝武装斗争为方向？这是一个根本问题。
    “从巴黎公社到光荣的十月革命和震撼世界的中国革命的反对资本主义的世界革命运动的全部经验都清楚地表明，只有通过对剥削阶级进行武装斗争，才能取得人类的解放。
    “只有打碎资产阶级的国家机器——其核心是武装部队——工人阶级和劳动人民才能建立他们自己的政权。”
    文章说：“在当代，毛泽东是最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他在各方面发展了马克思列宁主义。在全世界反对修正主义的斗争中，毛泽东对中国革命所作的理论的总结，受到了人们的重视。毛泽东思想照亮了世界各国人民走向社会主义的道路。毛泽东思想是当代的革命理论——没有这种革命理论，就没有革命。亿万人民正按照这种革命理论办事。因为这种革命理论是符合他们的迫切需要的。
    “毛泽东的下面这些话是多么质朴，多么深刻而正确呵！他说：‘没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。’‘枪杆子里面出政权’；‘革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。’”
    文章说：“本周在中国以外的亿万人民也都在庆祝中国解放的节日。这样做，对于他们个人是莫大的欢乐，因为中国是表明人民的巨大威力的伟大标志。
    “中国在粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫分子、取得了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利当中欢度国庆。用来粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫分子的武器，就是革命的毛泽东思想。
    “在全世界，修正主义者在革命的打击下摇摇欲坠。他们比任何时候更加四分五裂了。”文章写道：“中国庆祝的伟大胜利，也是世界革命人民的伟大胜利。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    “人民中国万岁！
    “久经考验和锻炼的中国共产党万岁！
    “祝人民中国的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万寿无疆！
    “马克思列宁主义万岁！”
