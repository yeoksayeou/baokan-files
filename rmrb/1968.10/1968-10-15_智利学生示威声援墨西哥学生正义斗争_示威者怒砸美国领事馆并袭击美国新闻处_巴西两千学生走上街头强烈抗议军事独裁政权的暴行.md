Chilean students staged protests in support of the Mexican students' just struggle. Protesters smashed the windows of the U.S. consulate and attacked the U.S. Information Service.

Two thousand Brazilian students took to the streets to strongly protest against the atrocities of the military dictatorship.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Santiago: Chilean students went on strike and protested on the 7th and 8th, condemning the Chilean police's suppression of students and supporting the Mexican and other Latin American students' just struggle against reactionary military police brutality.

On the 7th, 20,000 university students in Santiago, the capital of Chile, went on strike to protest the recent brutal suppression by the police of Chilean students who were supporting the Mexican students' struggle against persecution and massacre. The students also took to the streets to march and bravely fought against the armed police who came to suppress them.

More than 7,000 university students in Concepcion, Chile, went on strike and protested on the 8th, supporting the Mexican and other Latin American students' just struggle against persecution and suppression.

The marching crowd advanced towards the local U.S. consulate, shouting slogans against U.S. imperialism and monopolistic forces along the way. The protesting students angrily threw stones, smashing the windows of the U.S. consulate. The marching crowd also attacked the U.S. Information Service in the city. Some young people threw stones at the Mexican consulate. The protesting students fought against the reactionary police who came to suppress them for several hours.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro: About 2,000 students in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, took to the streets on the 9th to protest and march, strongly condemning the pro-U.S. military dictatorship's brutal suppression of the student movement.

The reactionary authorities in Brazil, frightened by the student movement, sent reactionary troops to patrol the streets early in the morning on the 9th, strengthening security in an attempt to prevent the students' protests. However, the brave students, divided into several groups, rushed towards the center of Rio de Janeiro, holding several protests and marches. The reactionary police savagely threw tear gas at the protesting students, who bravely resisted, and the struggle lasted for several hours. The protesting students, filled with hatred towards U.S. imperialism, rushed towards the U.S. embassy, angrily smashing the windows of the U.S. embassy with stones. This protest caused traffic in Rio de Janeiro to come to a standstill.
