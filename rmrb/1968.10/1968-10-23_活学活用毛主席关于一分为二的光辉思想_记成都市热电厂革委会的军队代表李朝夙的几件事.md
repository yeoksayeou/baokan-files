The military representative of the Chengdu City Thermal Power Plant Revolutionary Committee, Li Zhaosu, has carried forward the Party's tradition of combining theory with practice. He has specifically helped the members of the plant's revolutionary committee to study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical thoughts, using the perspective of "one divides into two" to view and analyze everything, achieving excellent results. The following are a few examples of his work.

Using a Developmental Perspective to View People

Originally, this plant had two revolutionary mass organizations. One had six or seven hundred people and had generally maintained the correct direction. The other had only a few dozen people and had made some mistakes. When the revolutionary committee was established, the leader of the smaller organization, Wan Xiushen, became a standing committee member, and the leader of the larger organization, Ma Faguang, became a deputy director. They both worked together. At the beginning of his work, Wan had two fears: first, he had made mistakes in the past and was afraid of making new ones; second, he was afraid of not having enough authority, and that his words would not be heeded. Therefore, he worked cautiously. Li Zhaosu saw this situation and had a heart-to-heart talk with Wan, helping him study Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical thoughts and the perspective of "one divides into two." They analyzed the reasons for his past mistakes. After several heart-to-heart talks, Wan realized that his past mistakes were mainly due to bourgeois factionalism, which allowed the class enemy to exploit. Now that he was part of the revolutionary committee, he should learn from his mistakes, overcome bourgeois factionalism, and exercise power with proletarian party spirit, following Chairman Mao's instructions. In this way, he could gain the support of the masses.

From then on, Wan worked more boldly. When allocating housing for the workers, he seriously implemented the mass line, conducted thorough investigations and research, and made reasonable allocations based on the actual situation of the workers. Even for people from his own faction, he treated them equally without any special favors. However, some people from the other faction did not listen when things did not go their way, causing Wan to have more concerns. At this time, Li Zhaosu talked to the deputy director of the revolutionary committee, Ma Faguang, saying: "Wan is determined to correct his mistakes and make new contributions. Here, conditions are important, and we should create conditions for him. Now, some people do not listen to him; you are all members of the revolutionary committee and should uphold the authority of the revolutionary committee." After hearing this, Ma went to talk to the masses from his own faction, pointing out: The revolutionary committee is a new power. Regardless of which faction the members originally belonged to, as long as they act according to Mao Zedong Thought and exercise power with proletarian party spirit, they should be actively supported. With Ma's help, some masses truly realized that Wan was working hard for the people and had not mixed in any personal interests or bourgeois factionalism, and they also became convinced.

Progress and Backwardness

After the establishment of the plant's revolutionary committee, the members emphasized proletarian politics everywhere, closely connected with the masses, and the entire plant's revolution was booming, with production flourishing. They received praise from the municipal revolutionary committee. Amidst the praise, Li Zhaosu noticed that some committee members were going to the masses less frequently. The worker masses also reflected: "Now, some committee members speak more arrogantly, and their work arrangements have become more authoritative. We also sense the 'official air' from them."

The masses sensing the "official air" from the revolutionary committee members is a dangerous signal. Li Zhaosu thought: In the past, the revolutionary committee members had good connections with the masses, and the masses said they were ordinary soldiers. Why did the masses sense the "official air" after receiving praise? He brought this question to study with the revolutionary committee members, learning Chairman Mao's teachings on "one divides into two": "Regarding our work, affirming everything or negating everything is one-sidedness." He also said: "Humility makes one progress, and pride makes one backward." Comparing with Chairman Mao's great teachings, Li Zhaosu first used the perspective of "one divides into two" to summarize and review his own work in the previous period, focusing on reviewing his pride and self-satisfaction after receiving praise from superiors and the dangerous tendency of alienating the masses. Li Zhaosu took the lead, and other committee members also made self-criticisms. Everyone received a profound education, realizing that receiving praise should also be viewed with "one divides into two." Past work achievements are good, but if one becomes proud and alienates the masses, one will inevitably fall behind. Therefore, one should treat praise as a driving force, not a burden. Receiving praise once, checking for shortcomings once, this is how one can continuously progress.

The Mainstream and the Sidestream

During the approval of the class leadership group members by the plant revolutionary committee, the following incident occurred: The workers of a class supported a worker to be a member of the leadership group, and most of the revolutionary committee members agreed. However, a few committee members opposed it, citing that the worker had joined the wrong faction in the past. The two sides could not reach an agreement. Seeing this situation, Li Zhaosu led everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught: "These comrades' method of looking at problems is wrong. They do not look at the essential aspects and mainstream of the problem but emphasize the non-essential and non-mainstream aspects." Then, he asked the committee members who knew the worker to fully introduce his situation. Although this worker had joined the wrong faction during the Cultural Revolution, this was only temporary. Looking at his entire history and work, he was a good worker who loved Chairman Mao and worked selflessly. The worker's essence and mainstream were good. One should not deny everything about someone just because of a temporary mistake. Li Zhaosu said: "We should view any mass organization with 'one divides into two.' A mass organization with the correct overall direction may have a few bad people mixed in. An organization with a temporarily wrong overall direction has the majority of the masses loving Chairman Mao and is good in essence; they are all our class brothers." Li Zhaosu's analysis based on Chairman Mao's teachings raised the awareness of the committee member, and the approval of the worker as a class leadership group member was finally smoothly passed.

Through the handling of this incident, the ideological level of the revolutionary committee members was raised another step.

    活学活用毛主席关于一分为二的光辉思想
    ——记成都市热电厂革委会的军队代表李朝夙的几件事
    成都市热电厂革委会的军队代表李朝夙，发扬党的理论和实践相结合的传统作风，有的放矢地帮助厂革委会成员，活学活用毛主席光辉的哲学思想，用一分为二的观点看待一切，分析一切，收到了很好的效果。下面记述的就是其中的几件事。
    用发展的观点看人
    这个厂原来有两派革命群众组织，一派有六、七百人，大方向一直比较正确。一派只有几十个人，曾经犯过一些错误。厂革委会成立时，人数较少的一派组织的负责人万秀臣当了常委，人数较多的一派的负责人马发全当了副主任，他俩都在一起工作。老万开始工作时有两怕：一是过去犯过错误，怕弄不好再犯新的错误；二怕腰杆不硬，说话没人听。因此，他工作起来缩手缩脚。李朝夙看到这种情况，便找老万谈心，和他共同学习毛主席的光辉的哲学思想、一分为二的观点，帮他分析过去犯错误的原因。经过多次谈心，使老万认识到，过去犯错误主要是资产阶级派性作怪，被阶级敌人钻了空子。现在参加革委会了，应当从错误中吸取教训，克服资产阶级派性，用无产阶级党性掌权，按毛主席指示办事。这样，就能得到群众的拥护。
    从此，老万工作比较大胆了。在为职工分配住房时，他认真贯彻群众路线，经过充分调查研究，从职工的实际情况出发，进行合理分配。即使是原来自己一派组织里的人，也一视同仁，不给任何特殊照顾。但另一派群众中有个别人，在不合自己心意时，就不服从，使老万又增加了顾虑。这时，李朝夙就找革委会副主任马发全说：“老万决心改正错误立新功。在这里，条件是重要的，我们应当为他创造条件。现在有个别人不听他的，你们都是革委会成员，要维护革委会的权威呵。”老马听了后，就去找自己一派组织的群众谈心，指出：革委会是新生政权，不管原先是哪一派的人参加革委会，只要他是按毛泽东思想办事，用无产阶级党性掌权，就应当积极支持。在老马的帮助下，一些群众真正认识到：老万是尽心尽力为群众服务的，没有掺杂“私”字和资产阶级派性，也都心悦诚服了。
    进步与落后
    厂革委会成立后，委员们处处突出无产阶级政治，紧密联系群众，全厂革命轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上，受到市革委会的表扬。在一片赞扬声中，李朝夙发现有些委员逐渐地到群众里面去的少了。工人群众也反映：“现在有的委员说话气粗了，布置工作有派头了，我们也闻到‘官气’了。”
    群众闻到了革委会委员的“官气”，这是一个危险的信号。李朝夙想：过去革委会成员联系群众不错，群众说他们是普通一兵。为什么受到表扬以后，群众反而闻到了“官气”呢？他便带着这个问题，和革委会委员一道学习毛主席关于一分为二的教导：“对于我们的工作的看法，肯定一切或者否定一切，都是片面性的。”又说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。对照毛主席的伟大教导，李朝夙首先用一分为二的观点总结检查了自己前一段的工作，着重检查了自己在受到上级表扬后产生的骄傲自满情绪和脱离群众的危险倾向。李朝夙一带头，其他委员也纷纷作了自我批评。大家受到了一次深刻的教育，认识到：受到表扬也要一分为二，过去工作取得了很大成绩，这本是好事，如果因此骄傲起来，脱离了群众，就必然要落后。因此，要把表扬当动力，不当包袱。受一次表扬，检查一次缺点，这样才能不断进步。
    主流和支流
    在厂革命委员会审批班组革命领导小组成员名单的时候，发生了这样一件事：有一个班的工人群众支持一个工人当领导小组成员，厂革命委员会的大多数委员同意，有个别委员却表示反对，原因是这个工人过去站错了队。两种意见争持不下。李朝夙看到这种情况，就领着大家学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“这些同志看问题的方法不对。他们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西。”接着又请了解这个工人的委员全面介绍了他的情况。这个工人在文化大革命中虽然一时站错了队，但这只是暂时的，从他的全部历史，全部工作来看，他是热爱毛主席、一心为公的好工人。这个工人的本质和主流是好的。绝不能因为一时的错误，就否定人家的一切。李朝夙说：“我们对任何群众组织，都要一分为二地看，大方向正确的群众组织，也可能混进极少数坏人。大方向一时错了的组织，大多数群众是热爱毛主席的，本质是好的，都是我们的阶级弟兄。”李朝夙根据毛主席的教导所作的分析，使那个委员提高了认识，最后顺利地通过了批准那个工人为班领导小组成员。
    通过这件事的处理，革命委员会成员的思想水平又提高了一步。
