Under the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitors and capitalist-roaders, Soviet workers are suffering double the hardship and double the injustice. The old workers at the Kalinin Sugar Factory have been unjustly laid off, and child laborers at the Red Polyan Factory are being cruelly mistreated. These are just a few examples of the tragic fate of millions of Soviet brothers. Seeing the painful plight of our Soviet class brothers today, we Chinese workers feel immense sympathy, immense sorrow, and immense indignation!

Looking at the plight of Soviet workers today and reflecting on our own past experiences, countless thoughts surge through our minds. The three of us were all oppressed by capitalists before liberation and have a belly full of bitterness. Some of us started working as child laborers in our teens, working twenty hours a day and still not getting enough to eat; later, our eyes were almost blinded, and we could barely walk, so we had to crawl. The big boss saw that we were almost disabled and couldn't produce much, so he ruthlessly said, "I don't have the money to support idle people!" and kicked us out. Some of us had both father and son working as laborers, but the father was fired just because he got sick, and the burden of the family's livelihood fell on one person's shoulders. These are all things from the old society. Since our great leader Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to victory in the revolution, everything has changed fundamentally. However, the Soviet working class, which had achieved the victory of the October Revolution, is now suffering the same fate as we did before liberation. Why is this?

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. The Soviet working class is now back in the painful situation of the tsarist rule, precisely because the power in the Soviet Union has changed hands.

Because the Soviet revisionist clique has seized power, capitalism has been fully restored in the Soviet Union. A small handful of new bourgeois privileged classes are riding roughshod over the laboring people, acting tyrannically and arbitrarily. All the systems they promote and the organizations they control are all for the purpose of exploiting and oppressing workers. The so-called "economic new system" that increases workers' income is actually to further squeeze the blood and sweat of workers to fatten the privileged class. The so-called "trade union" organizations that represent the interests of workers are actually the accomplices in suppressing workers. The Soviet working class is completely in a state of slavery.

The reality of the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union has educated the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the whole world, making them realize a truth: power is the lifeline of the working class.

The great tragedy that occurred in the Soviet Union has given the Chinese working class a very profound lesson.

We must firmly hold the power in the hands of the working class. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to usurp the party and the state power in China, achieve the restoration of capitalism, and make us workers live a life worse than that of cattle and horses again. We firmly refuse! In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, we, the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians, fear neither heaven nor earth, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his horse," and under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we have beaten down the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party headed by the Chinese Khrushchev and thoroughly seized back all the power they usurped. The proletarian dictatorship in our country is more consolidated than ever before.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The broad masses of the people, the broad masses of party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long." The increasingly awakened Soviet people are constantly strengthening their struggle against the Soviet revisionist rule. The leaflets of the "Stalin Group" in the Soviet Union call on the Soviet working class and laboring people to rise up and overthrow the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique and rebuild the proletarian dictatorship. We, the Chinese working class, firmly stand on the side of our Soviet class brothers and fully support the struggle of the Soviet people against the Soviet revisionist clique. We firmly believe that the Soviet working class and laboring people, who have the glorious tradition of the October Socialist Revolution, will surely raise high the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, organize and take action, fight bravely, and advance fearlessly to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, rebuild the proletarian dictatorship, and bring the Soviet Union back to the socialist road.

### 失去政权，就失去了一切

    失去政权，就失去了一切
    北京第一机床厂老工人　狄永禄　高玉贤　葛增武
    在苏修这伙叛徒、工贼的统治下，苏联工人兄弟们正在吃二遍苦，受二道罪。加里宁制糖厂老工人被无理解雇，红色波利扬纳面包厂童工遭到残酷虐待，这些只是千千万万苏联兄弟的悲惨遭遇的一个缩影。我们中国工人看到苏联阶级兄弟今天的痛苦处境，感到无比同情，无比悲痛，无比愤慨！
    看看苏联工人兄弟今天的处境，想想我们自己过去走过的道路，千言万语一齐涌上心头。我们三个在解放前都受尽资本家的压迫，有着一肚子苦水。有的从十几岁开始就当童工，一天劳动二十来小时还吃不饱；后来眼睛快熬瞎了，走路都看不见了，只得爬着走。大老板一看，人快成残废了，榨不出什么油水了，就凶狠地说：“我没闲钱养活闲人！”把他一脚踢走。有的本来父子俩都是工人，父亲仅仅因为生了病，就被资本家解雇了，一家生活重担落到一个人的肩头。……这些，都是旧社会的事了。自从伟大领袖毛主席领导中国人民取得革命胜利以后，情况就根本不同了。但是，取得过十月革命胜利的苏联工人阶级，今天的遭遇竟然会同我们解放前的遭遇没有什么两样。这究竟为什么呢？
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”有了政权，就有了一切；失去了政权，也就失去了一切。苏联工人阶级今天又回到沙皇统治下的痛苦处境，正是因为苏联的政权已经改变了颜色。
    由于苏修叛徒集团掌握了政权，资本主义就在苏联全面复辟。一小撮新资产阶级特权阶层骑在劳动人民头上作威作福，横行霸道，他们推行的一切制度，把持的一切组织，统统是为着他们剥削工人、压迫工人服务的。打着什么“增加工人收入”幌子的“经济新体制”，实际上是要进一步压榨工人血汗来养肥特权阶层。挂着什么“代表工人利益”的“工会”组织，实际上是镇压工人的帮凶。苏联工人阶级完全处于受奴役的地位。
    苏联全面复辟资本主义的现实，教育了苏联人民，也教育了全世界革命人民，使他们认识了一个真理：政权是工人阶级的命根子。
    发生在苏联的这个大悲剧，使我们中国工人阶级得到了极其深刻的教训。
    我们一定要把政权牢牢掌握在工人阶级手里。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想在中国篡党篡政，实现资本主义复辟，叫我们工人再过那牛马不如的生活，我们坚决不答应！在我国无产阶级文化大革命中，我们广大的无产阶级革命派，天不怕地不怕，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的彻底革命精神，在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派打了下去，彻底夺回了他们所窃取的一切权力，我国的无产阶级专政比以往任何时候都更加巩固了。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”日益觉醒的苏联人民，正在不断加强反对苏修统治的斗争。苏联“斯大林小组”的传单，号召苏联工人阶级和劳动人民起来打倒苏修叛徒集团的统治，重建无产阶级专政。我们中国工人阶级坚决同苏联阶级兄弟站在一边，全力支持苏联人民反对苏修叛徒集团的斗争。我们深信，具有十月社会主义革命光荣传统的苏联工人阶级和劳动人民，必然能够高举起马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜，组织起来，行动起来，英勇奋战，前赴后继，推翻苏修叛徒集团的反动统治，重建无产阶级专政，使苏联回到社会主义的道路上来。
