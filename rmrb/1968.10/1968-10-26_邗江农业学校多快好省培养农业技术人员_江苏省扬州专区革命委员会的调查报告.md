The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-Style Agricultural School in Yanzhou Quickly and Efficiently Trains Agricultural Technicians

Report on the Investigation by the Revolutionary Committee of Yanzhou District, Jiangsu Province

The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style agricultural school in Yanzhou County, Jiangsu Province, is a school established according to Chairman Mao's proletarian education line. The students are children of poor and lower-middle peasants with primary school education or above, and urban students who have gone to the countryside for a period of one to three or five years of labor training; there are also a few cadres from production brigades and teams. The school has two departments: agriculture and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, with a two-year curriculum. The school has no classrooms, and students do not leave their production teams or detach from labor. The commune is the teaching unit, and teaching, scientific research, and production are combined. The main content of student evaluation is the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, active participation in the three great revolutionary movements in rural areas, and the promotion of advanced agricultural technology. After graduation, students generally continue to work in their original production teams, serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Since its establishment in March 1965, the number of students in this school has increased from 690 to 4,179. Among them, 2,600 have become agricultural technicians and animal husbandry and veterinary doctors.

A New Type of Agricultural School

Yanzhou County in Jiangsu Province has a population of several hundred thousand. By 1965, the entire county had only 39 agricultural technicians and 10 animal husbandry and veterinary doctors, far from meeting the needs of agricultural production development. In March 1965, relevant departments in the county and the North Jiangsu Agricultural College tried to solve the problem through correspondence courses. However, the revisionist education line pushed by the capitalist roaders in the North Jiangsu Agricultural College did not address political issues or practical production. Seeing that the approach was wrong, the poor and lower-middle peasants established an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style new agricultural school themselves.

This Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style agricultural school has the following characteristics:

First, it holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizes proletarian politics, and places the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first position. "The Three Articles" are required reading for students. Students and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants read together every day, organize reporting meetings, and exchange learning experiences and insights. Chairman Mao instructed: "To hold study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." They organized and held many Mao Zedong Thought study classes, holding more than 60 sessions. The practice of class struggle in rural areas is a great classroom for actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants led them to participate in the "Four Cleanups" movement, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to tell them about their family history and village history. They held class education exhibitions together, organized recollections and comparisons, carried out revolutionary criticism, and exposed, denounced, and criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. This allowed the students to undergo tempering and testing in class struggle, continuously raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and striving to change their worldview.

Second, the management of the school is in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The enrollment of students is selected by the poor and lower-middle peasants and the school is open to them. Of the 4,179 students in the school, 73% are children of poor and lower-middle peasants. The teaching content of the school is jointly drafted by the poor and lower-middle peasants and teachers, and the teaching activities are supervised by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many old poor peasants take to the stage to give political and agricultural technology classes to students. The poor and lower-middle peasants also manage the students' studies, thoughts, and lives, ensuring that the students advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Third, it adheres to the principle of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," and implements the principle of unifying theory with practice in teaching. The teaching content is closely linked with agricultural production and scientific experiments. What is done, what is taught, and what is learned are integrated. The teaching materials are compiled based on the summary of advanced agricultural production experiences from local and other places, with scientific principles, practical requirements, local characteristics, easy to understand, easy to learn, and practical. The teaching methods are also based on the requirements of integrating learning with practice, and according to the characteristics of students being scattered in production teams, first distributing the teaching materials to students for self-study and discussion. The main teaching method for agriculture is on-site teaching, which is to go to the fields, combining lecturing, learning, and doing. On-site teaching adopts the "listen, watch, do, discuss, summarize" method, that is, listening to guidance classes, watching on-site performances, personally operating in the fields, group discussions, and summarizing arrangements. Students, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres in the production brigades and teams, plant "three fields" (experimental fields, seed fields, demonstration fields), applying the knowledge they have learned to these fields. The teaching of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine is also practice-oriented, which is carried out through organizing disease inspection, prevention, and mobile medical treatment. Sometimes, the veterinary hospital of the North Jiangsu Agricultural College conducts short-term training. Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out the mass training movement of officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers," a wide range of mutual teaching and learning activities were carried out, with the capable becoming teachers.

Fourth, the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school is a broad field for intellectuals to receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Intellectuals trained in old agricultural schools participated in the teaching work of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school, went out of the school, and deeply into the countryside, contacting reality. The vigorous three great revolutionary movements in the countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants' unlimited love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, their hardworking and thrifty nature, and their diligent work, etc., are the most practical and vivid education, making them gradually raise their awareness of self-consciousness in changing their thoughts. Teaching at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school, they not only have to lecture to students but also have to set an example for students, which promotes them to change their past situation of being detached from reality from books to books, and is also a good opportunity for tempering through labor and changing their thoughts.

A Sharp Contrast Between Two Types of Schools

Comparing the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school in Yanzhou County with the North Jiangsu Agricultural College vividly reflects the different paths and results of training agricultural technicians.

First, the ratio of teaching staff to students. The ratio of teaching staff to students in the North Jiangsu Agricultural College was 1:2.04 in 1958, 1:1.27 in 1962, and 1:1.81 in 1965. That is, for every two students, there is one teaching staff member serving them, and sometimes the number of teaching staff is even more than the number of students. The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school is different. Seventeen people from relevant departments in Yanzhou County and the North Jiangsu Agricultural College participated in the teaching work of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school, with each teaching staff member responsible for the teaching of at least 300 students.

Second, the training speed. The North Jiangsu Agricultural College was established in 1952, and in the 16 years since its establishment, it has graduated a total of 2,691 students. The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school has trained 2,600 students in just three years.

Third, the cost of running the school. The North Jiangsu Agricultural College spends about 3,600 yuan to train one student. The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school spends only 12 yuan to train one student.

Fourth, and most importantly, the quality of the students. "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become educated workers with socialist consciousness." This is the standard for measuring the quality of students. The students trained by the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school are mostly in line with the quality standards. The poor and lower-middle peasants call the students of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school the "three great elements" of the countryside: propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, fighters in the class struggle, and agricultural technicians (animal husbandry and veterinary doctors). They are the backbone of the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the students of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school firmly defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, seriously studied, enthusiastically propagated, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and resolutely carried out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They can diligently serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. Several young veterinary doctors who graduated from the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school in Huangjue Commune have made great achievements in developing the commune's animal husbandry, receiving enthusiastic praise from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In terms of knowledge quality, before 1966, most of the students of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school had become agricultural technicians and animal husbandry and veterinary doctors recognized by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Students studying agriculture generally mastered the basic laws, technical requirements, and practical operation methods of stable and high-yield rice and three types of wheat. Some students successfully experimented with the "three-crop system" and cultivated new varieties of rice and wheat. Students studying veterinary medicine generally learned to treat common diseases of pigs and cattle and animal husbandry management knowledge. Some students can perform large-scale operations such as safe delivery of draft cattle, artificial insemination, rectal examination, and castration of bulls. Originally, there were only four agricultural technology stations in the 27 communes of the entire county, and now every commune has established an agricultural technology promotion station. There are 389 production brigades, each equipped with an agricultural technician. Forty-two animal husbandry and veterinary medicine students work in the commune veterinary stations, and more students are "barefoot veterinarians" who do not leave agricultural labor.

"The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." The Red Bank Commune is a hilly area. A student from the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school dared to think and act, planting cotton on the mountain. In the first year, he planted 8.3 mu, with an average yield of 164 jin of lint cotton per mu. A "professor" of cotton from the North Jiangsu Agricultural College planted cotton in a flowerpot, used a balance to apply fertilizer, and observed the growth process of cotton with a flashlight every night, spending a lot of effort, and according to his own calculation, each mu could only harvest about 70 jin of lint cotton. Those agricultural college students who were detached from reality learned about "Michurin apples" and "Caucasian corn," and did not understand the cultivation of rice and wheat in the countryside; some who scored five points in school said that wheat flowering was moldy. A few, in order to gain fame and fortune, wrote "Flora of Yangzhou," spending a lot of time collecting more than 200 kinds of weeds, noting the collection time, place, and collector, which was of no use to agricultural production.

It can be seen that the agricultural colleges under the rule of the bourgeoisie do not emphasize proletarian politics, and their theories are detached from reality, which is a slow, inefficient, and costly path to training agricultural technicians; under the leadership of the working class, managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, and with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought held high, emphasizing practice, is a fast, efficient, and cost-effective path to training agricultural technicians.

The practice of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school in Yanzhou County has raised an important issue for the educational revolution in agricultural colleges, which is that agricultural colleges should all be moved to the countryside. This is the fundamental direction of the educational revolution in agricultural colleges. The practice of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school in Yanzhou shows that agricultural colleges in the countryside and in the city are very different. Agricultural colleges in the city are increasingly detached from the poor and lower-middle peasants and from reality. Even if they have their own farms and experimental fields, because they are detached from the masses' production practice, the things they produce cannot meet the masses' needs, and it is even more unfavorable for teachers and students to follow the path of integrating with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

From the experience of running the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University agricultural school in Yanzhou, we have realized that the school system of agricultural colleges must be shortened, one or two years is enough, the curriculum should be simplified, the divisions do not need to be so fine, and the basic courses can be arranged according to needs, achieving fewer but better. Teaching materials must be thoroughly reformed, eliminating those metaphysical and trivial philosophical things, and increasing local teaching materials from practice.

    邗江农业学校多快好省培养农业技术人员
    ——江苏省扬州专区革命委员会的调查报告
    江苏省邗江县有一所“抗大”式的农业学校。这所学校，是按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线办起来的。学生是具有高小以上文化水平的贫下中农子女和城市插队的初、高中毕业生，他们都经过一年至三、五年劳动锻炼；也有少数大队、生产队的干部。学校分农学和畜牧兽医两科，学制为二年。学校没有教室，学生不离开生产队，不脱离劳动，以公社为教学单位，实行教学、科研、生产三结合。对学生考核的主要内容是活学活用毛泽东思想，积极参加农村三大革命运动，大搞农业科学实验和推广农业先进技术。学生毕业后，一般仍在本生产队劳动，为贫下中农服务。
    这所学校，从一九六五年三月创办以来，学生由六百九十人发展到四千一百七十九人。其中，已经有两千六百人担任了农业技术员和畜牧兽医。
    一所新型的农业学校
    江苏省邗江县有几十万人口，到一九六五年，全县才有农业技术人员三十九人，畜牧兽医十人，远远不能适应农业生产发展的需要。一九六五年三月，县有关部门和苏北农学院挂钩，试图用函授的办法来解决问题。但是，苏北农学院走资派推行了一套修正主义教育路线，函来函去，不问政治，不管生产实际。贫下中农一看路子不对，便自己创办了一所“抗大”式的新型农业学校。
    这所“抗大”式农业学校有以下几个特点：
    一、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在首位。“老三篇”是学生的必读篇。学生和广大贫下中农在一起天天读，在一起组织讲用会，交流学习心得和体会。毛主席指示：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”他们就大办特办毛泽东思想学习班，先后办了六十多期。农村阶级斗争的实践，是学生活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，贫下中农带领他们参加“四清”运动，参加无产阶级文化大革命，向他们讲家史、村史，和他们一起举办阶级教育展览，组织回忆对比，开展革命大批判，揭露、声讨、批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行，使学生经受阶级斗争的锻炼和考验，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，努力改造世界观。
    二、学校的管理权掌握在贫下中农手里。招收学生，由贫下中农挑选，向贫下中农开门。全校四千一百七十九名学生，贫下中农子女占百分之七十三。学校的教学内容由贫下中农和教师共同拟定，教学活动由贫下中农监督进行。许多老贫农登上讲台，给学生上政治课、农技课。学生的学习、思想、生活，贫下中农也统统管起来，保证学生沿着毛主席革命路线前进。
    三、坚持贯彻执行“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的方针，教学实行理论和实际统一的原则。教学内容是和农业生产、科学实验紧密结合的。做什么，教什么，学什么，学用结合。教材是根据本地和外地农业生产的先进经验加以总结编写的，有科学原理，有实际要求，有地方性，易懂，易学，实用。教学方法也是从学用结合的要求出发，根据学生分散在生产队的特点，先把教材发给学生，由学生自己阅读、讨论。农学的主要传授方法是现场教学，就是到田头去，边讲、边学、边干。现场教学又采取“听、看、做、议、结”五字法，即听辅导课、看现场表演、亲自下田操作、分组讨论、总结布置。学生在大队、生产队和贫下中农、干部一起大种“三田”（试验田、种子田、样板田），把学来的知识，在“三田”中具体运用。畜牧兽医的教学也是以实践为主，就是通过组织查病、防病、巡回医疗等进行实践。有时，由苏北农学院的兽医院进行短期培训。遵照毛主席“应开展官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵的群众练兵运动”的教导，广泛开展了群众性的互教互学活动，能者为师。
    四、“抗大”农业学校是知识分子接受工农兵再教育的广阔天地。从旧农业院校培养出来的知识分子，参加了“抗大”农校的教学工作，走出学校，深入农村，接触实际。农村轰轰烈烈的三大革命运动，贫下中农无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想的阶级感情，贫下中农的艰苦朴素、辛勤劳动的本色等等，就是最实际、最生动的教育，使他们逐步地提高了改造思想的自觉性。到“抗大”农业学校教学，不仅要讲给学生听，而且要做给学生看，这就促使他们改变过去那种从书本到书本的脱离实际的状况，也是劳动锻炼、改造思想的好机会。
    两种学校的鲜明对比
    邗江县“抗大”农业学校和苏北农学院作一番比较，鲜明地反映出培养农业技术人员的不同道路，不同结果。
    一、教职员工与学生比例。苏北农学院教职员工与学生的比例，一九五八年为一比二·○四，一九六二年为一比一·二七，一九六五年为一比一·八一。就是说，两个学生就有一个教职员工为他们服务，有时教职员工比学生还多。“抗大”农业学校就不同了。邗江县有关部门和苏北农学院参加“抗大”农业学校教学工作的共十七人，一个教职员工至少要负责三百个学生的教学。
    二、培养速度。苏北农学院是一九五二年建校的，十六年来历届毕业生共两千六百九十一人。“抗大”农业学校在短短的三年中，就培养了两千六百人。
    三、办学经费。苏北农学院培养一个学生，要花三千六百元左右。“抗大”农业学校培养一个学生，只要十二元。
    四、最重要的是学生质量。“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”这是衡量学生质量的标准。“抗大”农业学校培养出来的学生，绝大多数是符合质量标准的。贫下中农称“抗大”农业学校的学生是“农村的三大员”：毛泽东思想宣传员、阶级斗争的战斗员、农业技术员（畜牧兽医）。他们是农村三大革命运动的骨干力量。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，“抗大”农校的学生，坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，认真学习、热情宣传、条条落实毛主席的最新指示，坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令。他们能勤勤恳恳地为贫下中农服务。黄珏公社几个在“抗大”农业学校毕业的青年兽医，在发展公社畜牧业方面就作出了很大成绩，受到贫下中农的热情赞扬。
    就知识质量来说，一九六六年以前入学的“抗大”农业学校的学生，绝大多数都已成为贫下中农公认的农业技术员和畜牧兽医。学农的学生，一般都能掌握水稻、三麦稳产高产的基本规律、技术要求和实际操作方法。有些学生试种“三熟制”成功，培育出稻、麦新良种。学兽医的学生，一般都学会了治疗常见的猪牛疾病和饲养管理知识，有些学生能进行耕牛安全接产、人工授精、直肠检查、公牛阉割等大型手术。原来全县二十七个公社只有四个农技站，现在每个公社都办起了农业技术推广站，三百八十九个大队，都配备了农技员。四十二个畜牧兽医学生到公社兽医站工作，更多的学生则是不脱离农业劳动的“赤脚兽医”。
    “卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。赤岸公社是丘陵山区，有个“抗大”农业学校的学生，敢想敢干，把棉花种到山上，第一年种了八亩三分，平均亩产皮棉一百六十四斤。苏北农学院有个棉花“教授”，棉花种在花盆里，施肥用天平称，每天夜晚用手电筒照，观察棉花的生长过程，花了一番“苦功”，照他自己的计算，每亩只能收皮棉七十斤左右。那些脱离实际的农学院的大学生学了“米丘林苹果”、“高加索玉米”，到农村不懂稻、麦栽培；有的在学校考五分，到农村，把麦子扬花说成是发霉。个别人为了成名成家，搞了《扬州植物志》，花了很多时间，采集二百多种杂草，注明采集时间、地点、采集人，对农业生产毫无用处。
    由此可见，资产阶级统治的农业院校，不突出无产阶级政治，理论脱离实际，是一条少慢差费的培养农业技术人员的道路；在工人阶级领导下，由贫下中农管理学校，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，注重实践，是一条多快好省地培养农业技术人员的道路。
    邗江县“抗大”农业学校的实践，为农业院校的教育革命提出了一个重要问题，就是农业院校要统统搬到农村去。这是农业院校教育革命的根本方向。邗江“抗大”农业学校的实践说明，农业院校办在农村和办在城里，是大不相同的。在城市里办农业院校，越办越脱离贫下中农，越脱离实际，即使自己有农场、试验田，由于它离开了群众的生产实践，搞出的东西不能适应群众的要求，更不利于教师、学生走同贫下中农相结合的道路。
    从邗江“抗大”农校的办学经验，我们体会到：农业院校的学制一定要缩短，一、二年就可以了，课程设置要精简，分科不需要那么细，基础课可以按照需要来安排，做到少而精。教材要彻底改革，废除那些形而上学、烦琐哲学的东西，增加来自实践的乡土教材。
