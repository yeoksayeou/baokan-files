The revolutionary symphony "Sha Jianhu" is a brilliant example of "learning from the West to serve China," and it is the first truly proletarian and laboring people's symphony in the world. It successfully portrays the lofty image of proletarian heroes and enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war.

The revolution in political content inevitably leads to a revolution in artistic form. The revolutionary symphony "Sha Jianhu" not only brings about fundamental changes in the art of orchestral music but also carries out a revolution in vocal art.

The revolutionary symphony "Sha Jianhu" critically and creatively employs forms such as chorus, round, accompaniment, and solo from Western vocal art, and uses polyphonic techniques, interwoven with the powerful sounds of Eastern and Western orchestras, reaching new heights in the depth and breadth of portraying revolutionary heroes.

In the "Overture," the chorus sings loudly, "The red flag waves, the bugle sounds, the mountains and rivers tremble," "The sons and daughters of China sing bravely as they march to the battlefield," "Wielding swords and long guns, the whole people are armed, burying the enemy in the vast sea," "To seek liberation, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought to arm ourselves, daring to struggle and win, tightly gripping the guns in our hands." The majestic and uplifting chorus vividly reveals the revolutionary theme of the symphony "Sha Jianhu," deeply expressing the invincible heroic spirit of the New Fourth Army soldiers, laying a good foundation for the entire symphony to portray the revolutionary hero image of the New Fourth Army commander Guo Jian'guang and the eighteen wounded soldiers.

In the "Perseverance" scene, the lead singer sings passionately, "We must learn from the green pine on the top of Mount Tai." When singing the words "green pine," the chorus emphasizes these three words with a powerful voice, vividly portraying the image of the New Fourth Army commander Guo Jian'guang, who remains calm and composed in the face of danger, and the determination of the eighteen wounded soldiers to stand united. Following this, the chorus uses mixed chorus and polyphonic techniques to portray the heroic figure of the New Fourth Army soldiers, "Eight thousand miles of storms cannot blow it down, nine thousand thunderbolts cannot shake it," presenting a scene of the New Fourth Army soldiers standing tall and steadfast in the storm, loyally dedicating themselves to the revolution.

The use of the chorus in the revolutionary symphony "Sha Jianhu" is entirely for the purpose of highlighting the image of the heroes, which is fundamentally different from the decadent pure technical performance in Western music art. Its unique accompaniment treatment is also based on political content and the need to portray heroic figures.

In the "Strategy" scene, after Ah Qing sings "The wind is tight, the rain is heavy, the sky is dark, and the clouds are low, making one restless and unable to sit still," the female chorus uses low, high, and humming techniques to interweave and respond with the solo, fully revealing Ah Qing's inner world at that time. When singing "Chairman Mao, with your guidance and the wisdom of the masses, I will surely overcome the enemy and pass through the difficulties," the powerful chorus shakes the heartstrings. In the last word "pass," the female soloist showcases the advantages of Western singing, clearly and freely singing the high-pitched trills, making it fresh and pleasing to the ear.

In the "Army and People's Deep Bond" scene, the symphony combines duets, unison singing, chorus, and solo. The revolutionary old mother Sha Niang and Guo Jian'guang's duet, which is like a family, is very touching. When Guo Jian'guang sings "Waiting for the comrades to recover from their injuries," Sha Niang sings with a deep and powerful voice, "Recovered from injuries, they are not allowed to leave my home. They should have three meals a day with nine bowls of rice, sleep until the sun sets in the west, and be fed until they are strong and sturdy, each one like an iron tower." Following this, in the chorus "At that time, strong and powerful, riding horses across Jiangnan, killing the enemy," suddenly a powerful solo sings "You, this revolutionary old mother" to end. Here, the intimate and sincere duet and the lively unison singing of the soldiers portray the deep and detailed class affection between the army and the people, making it vivid and lifelike.

Following the instructions of Comrade Jiang Qing, the revolutionary symphony "Sha Jianhu" has also made significant innovations in singing techniques. The singing styles of Guo Jian'guang, Ah Qing, and Sha Niang have been refined and created, harmoniously combining the strengths of Western singing in emphasizing the voice and the advantages of national singing in emphasizing pronunciation, based on the principle of portraying the image of workers, peasants, and soldiers heroes, achieving "voice and emotion in harmony." In the "Strategy" scene, to portray the heroine Ah Qing, under the personal guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, the traditional Western soprano and Peking Opera dan (female role) falsetto singing methods were broken, and the true and false voices were organically combined, successfully portraying the image of the underground liaison officer Ah Qing, leaving a deep impression on people.

The revolutionary symphony "Sha Jianhu" not only paves the way for the revolution in symphony but also opens up new paths for the revolution in vocal art.

    声乐艺术的革命
    鹰击宇
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》是“洋为中用”的光辉样板，是世界上第一部真正属于无产阶级和劳动人民的交响音乐。它成功地塑造了无产阶级的高大英雄形象，纵情地歌颂了毛主席关于人民战争的伟大思想。
    政治内容的革命必然引起艺术形式的革命。革命交响音乐《沙家浜》不仅在交响乐的器乐艺术上发生了根本的变革，而且在声乐艺术方面也进行了革命。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》批判地、有所创造地运用了西洋声乐艺术中的合唱、轮唱、伴唱、独唱等形式，并采用了复调的手法，和气势宏亮的中西乐队交织在一起，在塑造革命英雄人物的深度、广度上都达到了新的水平。
    在“序曲”中，合唱队高唱出“红旗飘，军号响，山河震荡”，“中华儿女慷慨高歌上战场”，“挥战刀，举长枪，全民武装，将敌寇埋葬在大海汪洋”，“求解放全靠着毛泽东思想武装，敢斗争敢胜利，紧紧握住手中枪。”雄壮高昂的合唱，鲜明地揭示了革命交响音乐《沙家浜》的革命主题，深刻地表现了我新四军指战员无敌于天下的无产阶级的英雄气概，为整部交响音乐塑造新四军指导员郭建光以及十八个伤病员的革命英雄群像，打下了一个很好的基础。
    在“坚持”一场中，领唱用激越的嗓音唱出了“要学那泰山顶上一青松”。当唱到“一青松”三个字时，合唱队把这三个字用宏亮的歌声突现出来，这就把在紧急关头临危不惧，指挥若定的新四军指导员郭建光的形象和十八位伤病员众志成城的决心表现了出来。紧接下去，歌队用混声合唱并加上复调的艺术处理手法，塑造了“八千里风暴吹不倒，九千个雷霆也难轰”的新四军英雄们的雄姿，展现了一幅在暴风雨中顶天立地、赤胆忠心为革命的新四军指战员的英雄群象。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》中合唱的运用，完全是为着突出英雄人物的形象服务的，它和西洋音乐艺术中没落的纯技术表演根本不同。它的别有意境的伴唱处理，也都是从政治内容和刻划英雄人物的需要出发的。
    在“授计”一场中，当阿庆嫂独唱了“风声紧雨意浓天低云暗，不由人一阵阵坐立不安”之后，女声伴唱用低回、高转和哼唱等手法和独唱相交叉、相呼应，充分展示了阿庆嫂当时的内心世界。而当唱到“毛主席，有你的教导，有群众的智慧，我定能战胜顽敌渡难关”时，雄壮有力的合唱震人心弦。在最后一个“关”字上，女声独唱发挥了西洋唱法的优点，清晰、洒脱地唱出了高音的甩腔，令人耳目一新。
    在“军民鱼水情”一场中，又把对唱、齐唱、合唱、独唱结合在一起。革命的老妈妈沙奶奶和郭建光的亲如一家的对唱，极为动人。当郭建光唱到“待等同志们伤痊愈”一句时，沙奶奶用苍劲宏大的音调唱出了“伤痊愈，也不准离开我家。要你们一日三餐九碗饭，一觉睡到日西斜，直养得腰圆膀又乍，一个个象座黑铁塔”，紧接着在“到那时，身强力壮跨战马，驰骋江南把敌杀”的一段合唱之后，忽然用豪迈有力的独唱唱出了“你这革命的老妈妈”来结束。这里，亲切、真挚的对唱和战士们生气勃勃的齐唱，把军爱民，民拥军，军民本是一家人的阶级情谊，刻划得深入细致，维妙维肖。
    遵照江青同志的指示，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》在演唱技巧上，也作了极有意义的创新。郭建光、阿庆嫂和沙奶奶的唱腔，经过提炼和创造，把西洋唱法注重声音的长处和民族唱法注重咬字的优点，在表现工农兵英雄形象的原则基础上，十分和谐地结合在一起，做到了“声情并茂”。在“授计”一场中，为了塑造阿庆嫂这一英雄人物的需要，在江青同志的亲自指导下，打破了过去西洋女高音和京剧旦角的假嗓唱法，将真假嗓有机地结合在一起，成功地塑造了地下联络员阿庆嫂的英雄形象，给人们留下了深刻的印象。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》，不仅为交响乐的革命开辟了道路，而且也为声乐艺术的革命开辟了道路。
