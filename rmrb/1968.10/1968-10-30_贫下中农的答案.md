In Huaxin City's suburban Shuiquan People's Commune, Houbu Camp Primary School, there was an instance where a teacher in Class 4, Grade 4, assigned a math problem from the textbook: "In Zhangjia Village before liberation, three households of landlords and rich peasants occupied 480 mu of land, while 24 households of poor and hired peasants only had 48 mu. How many times more households of poor and hired peasants are there compared to landlords and rich peasants? How many times more land do landlords and rich peasants occupy compared to poor and hired peasants?"

The students quickly calculated the correct answers. However, some students looked at their answers, feeling puzzled, and asked the teacher, "Why do landlords and rich peasants, with so few households, occupy so much land?" "With so many households of poor and lower-middle peasants, how do they survive with so little land?"

The teacher provided some theoretical explanations, saying that in the old society, poor and lower-middle peasants were oppressed and exploited by landlords. However, the students doubted the teacher's explanation, with some saying, "Are landlords and rich peasants really like that?"

The school's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, consisting of poor peasants, heard about this incident and fell into deep thought. He thought: The students' doubts about the teacher's answers are due to the revisionist educational line pushed by China's Khrushchev, which involves closed-door teaching, making students read dead books, focusing on grades, and teaching courses without teaching people. This cannot continue any further. We must make the students understand what class oppression and exploitation are. Comrade Lin Biao said, "If you don't understand what class is, and what exploitation is, you don't understand revolution." He decided to make up for this missing class on class education, ensuring that Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" takes root in the students' minds. With this in mind, he picked up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," full of passion, and strode into the classroom of Class 4, Grade 4.

This old poor peasant, who had suffered immense oppression and exploitation from landlords and capitalists in the old society, stood on the lectern for the first time in his life. His heart surged with emotion as he led the teachers and students in shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" several times. He said, "Children, we poor and lower-middle peasants now, thanks to Chairman Mao, have power and live a happy life. You study happily in school. But in the old society, we poor and lower-middle peasants were oppressed and exploited by landlords, working for them year-round, not as good as the landlords' dogs and pigs. When I was eight, I herded pigs for the landlord in our village. Once, during lunch, a pig went missing, and the landlord didn't give me any food, kicking me out. At that time, our whole family worked for the landlord, renting a small dilapidated room from him. My four-year-old younger brother died of illness because we had no money for treatment. The cruel landlord wouldn't let us carry my younger brother out through the front door. They said that poor people dying would ruin their 'family reputation,' forcing us to throw him over the wall. At that time, poor people had no right to speak, and we had no choice. I had to climb over the high wall, slowly carrying my four-year-old younger brother out."

The children, after hearing the old poor peasant's bitter experiences, felt a burning hatred for the landlord class. They shouted, "Never forget class bitterness, remember blood debts, overthrow the cruel landlords!" The old poor peasant saw the children's heightened class consciousness and felt joy from the bottom of his heart. However, he thought that this lesson was not yet finished. Not only should the children understand how to overthrow landlords, but they should also know that imperialists, reactionaries, and all ghosts and snakes in the world are our enemies. To conduct more practical and profound class struggle education for the children, he led all the teachers and students to visit the "Mass Grave" and the Class Education Exhibition Hall. Pointing to the white bones of class brothers buried alive under the Japanese puppet regime, he, with tears, as a witness to history, revealed and denounced the blood-stained crimes of imperialists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and capitalists oppressing and exploiting the working people, strongly refuting China's Khrushchev's "exploitation is beneficial" theory.

At the "Mass Grave" site, the old poor peasant organized the students to launch a revolutionary criticism session. The revolutionary teachers and students angrily criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Bai Suhua, a student from Class 4, Grade 4, said, "China's Khrushchev falsely claims that 'exploitation is beneficial.' He is afraid we will know that exploitation is a crime, so he uses grades to confuse us, keeping us locked in school all day learning for grades, making us unaware of why landlords have money and why the poor are poor. They do this to prevent us from knowing what oppression and exploitation are, so we won't rebel against them. In the future, we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must not stay indoors reading dead books; we must learn in class struggle and use what we learn in class struggle. We must master Mao Zedong Thought and take over the revolutionary cause."

The old poor peasant's vivid class struggle education class deeply educated the revolutionary teachers and students. The teacher of Class 4, Grade 4, deeply felt, "The problem that couldn't be solved in the classroom was answered by the old poor peasant. This is the real answer!"

    贫下中农的答案
    在阜新市郊区水泉公社户部营子小学，有一次，四年级一班的老师让学生算一道课本上的算术题：张家村解放前地主富农三户，霸占四百八十亩田地，贫雇农二十四户，只有四十八亩地。贫雇农户数是地富的几倍？地主富农霸占土地的亩数是贫雇农的几倍？
    这道题一出，孩子们很快地算出了正确答案。可是，有的孩子眼望着自己的答案，很不理解，奇怪地问老师：“为什么地主富农户数那么少占那么多地呢？”“贫下中农户数那么多只有那么一点地，咋活着呀？”
    老师做了一些理论上的解释，说是在旧社会贫下中农受地主的压迫和剥削。但是孩子们怀疑老师的讲解是否真实，有的说：“地富真是那样的？”
    学校贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队有一位老贫农知道了这件事，不禁沉思起来。他想：孩子们怀疑老师的答案，这是由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线，关门教学，叫学生读死书，搞分数第一，光教课不教人的恶果，现在再也不能继续下去了，一定叫孩子们懂得什么是阶级压迫和阶级剥削。林副主席说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”他决心把阶级教育这门主课补上去，使毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导在学生头脑中牢牢地扎下根。想到这里，他拿起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，满怀激情地大步走进四年级一班的教室。
    这位在旧社会受尽地主、资本家压迫和剥削的老贫农，有生以来第一次走上讲台。他心潮滚滚，带领师生一遍又一遍地高呼“毛主席万岁！”他说：孩子们，我们贫下中农现在托毛主席的福，有了权，过上了幸福生活，你们在学校愉快地学习。可是在旧社会，咱贫下中农受地主的压迫和剥削，长年给地主干活，不如地主家的狗和猪。我八岁时就给咱屯的地主放猪。有一次午间回家，猪少了一头，地主就不给我饭吃，把我打出来。那时我们全家给地主扛活，租住在地主的一间小破房里。我四岁的弟弟因有病没钱治死去了。狠心的地主不让我们把我弟弟从大门送出去。他们说穷人死了，从他们大门走败坏他们的“家风”，非让我们从墙上扔过去。那时没有咱穷人说话的权，没办法，我只好抱着四岁的弟弟，从高高的院墙上慢慢地爬着把我弟弟送出去了。孩子们，想想吧，牲口还要走门呢，可是我们穷人连门都不能走……。
    孩子们听了老贫农的诉苦，心中燃起了对地主阶级仇恨的烈火，他们高喊：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，打倒狠心的地主！”老贫农看到孩子们提高了阶级觉悟，从心眼里感到高兴。但是他一想，这一课还没有上完，不仅应当让孩子们懂得打倒地主，还应当让孩子们知道世界上的帝国主义、反动派和一切牛鬼蛇神都是我们的敌人。为了对孩子们进行更实际更深刻的阶级斗争教育，他又带领全校的师生，到“万人坑”、阶级教育展览馆参观。他指着在日伪统治下被活埋的阶级兄弟的白骨，流着泪，以一个历史见证人的身份，向孩子们揭露、控诉帝国主义、国民党反动派和资本家压迫和剥削劳动人民的血泪斑斑的罪行，有力地批驳了中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功论”。
    在“万人坑”的现场，老贫农又组织学生开展了一场革命大批判。广大革命师生愤怒批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线。四年级一班的学生白素华说：“中国赫鲁晓夫胡说‘剥削有功’，他怕我们知道剥削有罪，就用学分迷我们，把我们整天关在学校里为分数而学，害得我们连地主为什么有钱，穷人为什么穷都不知道。他们所以这样做，就是怕我们知道了什么是压迫，什么是剥削，起来造他们的反。今后我们一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。决不能坐在屋里读死书，一定要在阶级斗争中学，在阶级斗争中用，把毛泽东思想学到手，接好革命的班。”
    老贫农讲的这堂生动的阶级斗争教育课，深刻地教育了广大革命师生。四年级一班的老师深有感触地说：“课堂上解决不了的问题，老贫农给解答了。这才是真正的答案！”　郊革武
