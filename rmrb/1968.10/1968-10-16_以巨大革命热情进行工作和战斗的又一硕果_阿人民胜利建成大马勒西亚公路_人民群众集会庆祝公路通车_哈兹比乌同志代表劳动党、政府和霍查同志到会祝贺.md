The people of Dukagjin and Karmendaj in northern Albania held a grand rally in Karmendaj on October 13 to celebrate the completion of the Dajti-Mallakastra Highway and the completion of the power supply project in these two villages.

The new stage was adorned with a large portrait of Comrade Enver Hoxha. Red flags and banners were everywhere in the venue. The banners read: "Glory to the Albanian Party of Labour!" and "Long live our dearest son of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, Comrade Spiro Koleka, and First Secretary of the Party Committee of Shkodra, Comrade Kostandin, attended the celebration. Comrade Haxhi Lleshi cut the ribbon for the opening of the Dajti-Mallakastra Highway and delivered a speech at the celebration. Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, on behalf of the Albanian Party of Labour and the government, and on behalf of the beloved leader of the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, congratulated the completion of these two projects.

Comrade Haxhi Lleshi pointed out that it is particularly worth celebrating that these two major projects were completed on this historic day of the 60th birthday of the founder and leader of glorious Albanian Party of Labour, Comrade Enver Hoxha. He said that the construction of the Dajti-Mallakastra Highway, as well as the power supply projects in Karmendaj and Dukagjin, are part of the grand plan for the socialist construction of our country. They embody the concern of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha for the rapid development of mountain area construction.

He said that today, in socialist Albania, people everywhere are working and fighting with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm to implement the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party and the teachings of our dear leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha. The urban and rural laboring masses are fully mobilized to achieve the comprehensive victory of the Fourth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, especially to achieve self-sufficiency in grain; the struggle to smash bureaucracy and revolutionize national life; the measures taken to further revolutionize schools, and so on. All these show that our revolution is advancing steadily.

In discussing the international situation, Comrade Haxhi Lleshi said that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great victory for the world revolution. Under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, this revolution is making socialist China more consolidated, keeping it forever red, forever a stronghold of the world revolution, and forever advancing along the road of Mao Zedong.

Comrade Haxhi Lleshi pointed out that the recent visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu to the People's Republic of China has further strengthened the revolutionary friendship between our two peoples and the two Marxist-Leninist parties.

Comrade Haxhi Lleshi said that on this joyous day of the completion of major projects in socialist construction, we once again emphasize that our people, who are fearless, united as never before, and have a high revolutionary spirit, together with their well-equipped and modernized army, under the leadership of our heroic Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, are always ready to give a fatal blow to any enemy who dares to touch our independence and interests, and are always ready to defend Marxism-Leninism and the revolution, and to fulfill our internationalist duties as before.

The Dajti-Mallakastra Highway is 65 kilometers long. The lowest point of the highway is at an altitude of 900 meters, and the highest point reaches an altitude of 1,400 meters. Construction began on April 1, 1967, and was completed on October 13, 1968.

    以巨大革命热情进行工作和战斗的又一硕果
    阿人民胜利建成大马勒西亚公路
    人民群众集会庆祝公路通车　哈兹比乌同志代表劳动党、政府和霍查同志到会祝贺
    据新华社地拉那十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚北方山区杜卡杰尼乡和卡尔门迪乡人民十三日在卡尔门迪乡举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝大马勒西亚公路胜利建成和这两个乡的供电工程完工。
    会场上新搭起的主席台上悬挂着霍查同志巨幅画像。会场上到处是红旗和标语牌。标语牌上写着：“光荣属于阿尔巴尼亚劳动党！”“我国人民最亲爱的儿子霍查同志万岁！”
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局候补委员哈兹比乌，劳动党中央书记斯巴修，劳动党斯库台区委员会第一书记科斯塔等参加了庆祝大会，哈兹比乌同志为大马勒西亚公路的通车剪彩，并在庆祝大会上讲话。哈兹比乌代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府，代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的敬爱领袖霍查同志，祝贺这两项工程的胜利建成。
    哈兹比乌指出，特别值得祝贺的是，这两大工程是在光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的缔造者和领袖霍查同志六十寿辰这一历史性的日子里建成的。他说，大马勒西亚公路的建设，以及卡尔门迪乡和杜卡杰尼乡的供电工程，是我国社会主义建设宏伟纲领的组成部分。它体现了劳动党和霍查同志对迅速发展山区建设的关怀。
    他说，今天，在社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚各地，人们都在为贯彻党的第五次代表大会的历史性决议和我们亲爱的领袖霍查同志的教导，以空前未有的革命热情进行工作和战斗。城乡劳动群众为提前胜利实现第四个五年计划的全面动员，特别是为实现粮食自给所取得的成就；为粉碎官僚主义和使国家生活革命化的斗争；为使学校进一步革命化所采取的措施，等等，这一切都说明我国革命正在不断前进。
    哈兹比乌在谈到国际大好形势时说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是整个世界革命的伟大胜利。在伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的领导下，这一革命正在使社会主义的中国更加巩固，使她永远保持鲜红的颜色，永远是世界革命的坚强堡垒，永远沿着毛泽东的道路前进。
    哈兹比乌指出，由巴卢库同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团最近对中华人民共和国的访问，更进一步加强了我们两国人民、两个马克思列宁主义党之间的革命友谊。
    哈兹比乌说，在社会主义建设的重大工程竣工的欢乐日子里，我们再次强调指出，无所畏惧的、空前团结的、具有高度革命精神的我国人民，同他们的具有良好装备的和现代化的军队在一起，在霍查同志为首的我们英雄的党的领导下，时刻准备给予任何胆敢触动一下我们的独立和利益的敌人以致命的打击，时刻准备着为保卫马克思列宁主义和革命，一如既往地光荣履行自己的国际主义义务。
    大马勒西亚公路全长六十五公里。公路最低点海拔九百米，最高点达海拔一千四百米。去年四月一日开工，到今年十月十三日竣工。
