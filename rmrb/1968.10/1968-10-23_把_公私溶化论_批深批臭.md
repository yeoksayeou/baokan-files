The Chinese Khrushchev will never understand the spirit of revolutionary self-sacrifice of the proletariat. He shouts, "Personal interests must be taken care of; without personal interests, there can be no collective interests." He absurdly claims that "they have shown the heroic spirit of communist self-sacrifice in their labor" because they "see their personal interests as dependent on the collective interests." This is the Chinese Khrushchev's malicious slander against our countless revolutionary fighters and Communist Party members who bravely fight for the cause of the proletarian revolution and work selflessly. It is a complete denial of the spirit of communist self-sacrifice for the public good.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our army is a people's army. It is an army of the people. It is a people's army in the true sense of the word." Revolutionary fighters listen to Chairman Mao's words. Our work in the Navy Engineering Corps is quite arduous, but we take "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as our guideline. We fear no hardships, brave the wind and rain, and seek out hard work. We climb high cliffs, drill holes, dive into the sea to blast coral reefs, operate drills, clear misfires, push carts—wherever there is difficulty, we go; wherever there is danger, we go. We have never considered "personal interests" or "personal happiness."

Last January 6, our demolition team was carrying out a blasting task in a certain place. After loading the stone cannons and igniting the fuse, we all hid. Suddenly, we noticed two commune members walking towards the blasting area. We shouted, but they didn't hear us; we signaled, but they didn't see us. The fuses were hissing... In this critical moment, I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and I jumped up and ran towards the two commune members, shouting as I ran. Before I could run a few steps, the blasting began. Boom, boom... Flying stones blew off my safety helmet. At that moment, I only thought: I must save the two commune members. It doesn't matter if I am gone, but the two commune members must be saved. So I rushed forward, shouting. The two commune members quickly hid. Just at that moment, dozens of stone cannons exploded, the sound was deafening, smoke filled the air, and stones flew everywhere. I didn't have time to hide and was seriously injured and fainted, but I felt very happy because the two class comrades had been saved. This incident made me realize that public and private interests are like fire and water, incompatible. Only with great public spirit can one be selfless, and only with selflessness can one be fearless. If I had thought about myself for even half a second, I would have hesitated for half a second. If I had thought about myself for a second, I would have hesitated for a second. If we followed the Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense, wouldn't we be saving the commune members because we "saw our personal interests"? This is utterly absurd!

The Chinese Khrushchev denies the spirit of self-sacrifice for the public good of the proletariat. His sinister purpose is to deny the establishment of the worldview of "wholeheartedly serving the people," to oppose ideological remolding, and to attempt to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. We must stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," thoroughly criticize and expose the "theory of blending public and private interests" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, study and apply "The Three Constantly Read Articles," fiercely struggle against "selfishness," and firmly establish "public spirit." We are determined to temper ourselves into new people who are wholeheartedly devoted to the public good and to the revolution.

    把“公私溶化论”批深批臭
    海军某部五好战士　梁道成
    中国赫鲁晓夫永远不会懂得什么是无产阶级的革命自我牺牲精神。他叫喊什么：“个人利益一定要照顾，没有个人利益即无整体利益”；胡说“他们在劳动中表现了共产主义的自我牺牲的英雄气概”，是因为他们“看到个人利益”“依存于集体利益”之中。这是中国赫鲁晓夫对我们千千万万为无产阶级革命事业而英勇战斗、忘我劳动的革命战士、共产党员的恶毒诽谤，对一心为公的共产主义自我牺牲精神的全盘否定。
    毛主席指出：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”革命战士最听毛主席的话。我们海军工程兵的工作是比较艰苦的，但是，我们以“完全”“彻底”为人民服务为行动准则，不畏艰险，不避风雨，专找“苦”吃。大家爬高崖，打毛洞，下海底炸珊瑚礁，开风钻，排哑炮，推斗车，那里有困难就到那里去，那里有危险就到那里去，从来没有考虑到什么“个人利益”、“个人幸福”。
    去年一月六日，我们爆破组在某地进行爆破采石任务。装好石炮，点燃了导火索，大家隐蔽起来以后，突然发现转弯的地方有两个公社社员，向爆破区走过来。喊，他们没听到；打手势，他们没看到。三十多条导火索嗤嗤直叫……在这千钧一发的瞬间，我想起了毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，一跃而起，向那两个社员飞跑过去，边跑边喊。没跑出几步，爆破开始了，轰，轰……飞石把我的安全帽都掀落在地上。这时，我想的只是：一定要使两个社员脱险，没有我不要紧，没有两个社员不行。于是我拚命往前边冲边喊。两个社员终于迅速隐蔽起来。正当这时候，几十个石炮爆炸了，响声震天，硝烟弥漫，石块横飞。我来不及隐蔽，被打得重伤昏迷，但是我内心非常愉快，因为两个阶级亲人终于脱险了。这件事，使我懂得，公和私是水火不相容的，大公才能无私，无私才能无畏。当时如果我有半秒钟想到自己，我就会有半秒钟的犹豫，有一秒钟想到自己，就会有一秒钟的犹豫。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的鬼话，我们抢救社员岂不是因为什么“看到了个人利益”吗？真是荒唐透顶！
    中国赫鲁晓夫否定一心为公的无产阶级自我牺牲精神，其阴险目的，就在于否定树立“全心全意地为人民服务”的世界观，反对思想改造，妄图实现其复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。我们一定要站在毛主席的革命路线上，“斗私，批修”，把中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的“公私溶化论”批深批臭，大学大用“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，决心把自己锻炼成一心为公，一心为革命的共产主义新人。
