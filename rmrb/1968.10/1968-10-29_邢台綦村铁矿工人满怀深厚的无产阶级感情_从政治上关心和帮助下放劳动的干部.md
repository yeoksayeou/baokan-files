Workers of Qixian Iron Mine in Xingtai, filled with deep proletarian sentiments, politically care for and assist cadres sent down for labor. They use Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate the cadres, greatly raising their political awareness, arousing their revolutionary enthusiasm to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and accelerating the pace of their ideological transformation.

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, October 26 - Workers of Qixian Iron Mine in Hebei Province, after implementing "streamlining and efficiency," sent down more than 60 percent of the office staff to various workshops and teams to participate in labor in July and August this year. The broad masses of workers realized that helping cadres to re-learn is an obligation of the working class and made preparations a few days before the cadres were sent down. They enthusiastically arranged living quarters for the cadres and assigned them labor posts according to their individual situations.

The workers of this mine, filled with deep proletarian sentiments, first politically care for the cadres and help them solve their immediate thoughts, promoting the transformation of their worldviews. Some of the sent-down office staff carried the burden of thinking that "being sent down for labor is not honorable." Although they came down physically, their hearts did not. To address this immediate thought, the workers, on the one hand, studied Chairman Mao's instructions with the sent-down cadres, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, raising the cadres' awareness of the two-line struggle and their understanding of the importance of cadres being sent down for labor. On the other hand, they conducted class education for the sent-down cadres. In addition to having old workers with deep grievances give speeches on recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, they also led the sent-down cadres to nearby production teams of people's communes to listen to old poor peasants recount their family histories, village histories, and class struggle histories, raising the cadres' class consciousness and strengthening their proletarian sentiments towards the laboring people. One cadre, when first sent down to the team, was reluctant to walk in front of people in his work uniform. After listening to the old workers and poor and lower-middle peasants' bitter complaints about the old society, he was deeply moved, feeling that he was "a person who forgets the sowing of grain when eating rice, forgets the weaving of cloth when wearing clothes. The laboring people raised me with their blood and sweat, but now I forget the laboring people and lose the character of the laboring people." He expressed his determination to settle down in the mine for life and thoroughly transform his worldview. Now he feels that wearing a work uniform and going up the mountain to mine is the greatest honor and happiness.

Some sent-down cadres had weak legs and soft waists, worried about not being able to pass the "labor test," and feared being laughed at by the workers. To address this thought, the workers first helped them correct their attitudes towards labor, saying to them: "Cadres should first place themselves in the position of ordinary laborers, turn their thoughts and feelings to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, put down their airs, and work together with us, thinking as one, striving as one, sweating as one, sincerely and wholeheartedly walking the same path. As long as the attitude is correct, the skills of labor can be learned." One cadre of student origin was very unhappy when sent down to the workshop. Worker Wang Fu Kui, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," took the initiative to talk with him and studied with him Chairman Mao's teaching: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually combines with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Wang Fu Kui also told him about the experiences of two other cadres of student origin who, after being sent down for labor, sincerely and wholeheartedly combined with the masses of workers, inspiring him deeply. From then on, his determination to settle down in the workshop grew stronger, his will became firmer, and his self-awareness to transform his worldview became more intense.

The workers of this mine also paid attention to enthusiastically uniting with the sent-down cadres, strictly demanding of them, and cherishing the active factors and progressive demands among them. As long as they achieved some results and made some progress, the workers would see it in their eyes and rejoice in their hearts, praising them and encouraging them wholeheartedly to continue moving forward. Recently, with the participation of the workers, this mine selected a group of active elements who actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought from the sent-down office staff to attend the experience exchange meeting on actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought convened by the revolutionary committee of the mine.

Due to the enthusiastic help of the broad masses of workers, in just over two months, the sent-down cadres of this mine have significantly raised their awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle, and their spiritual outlook has undergone obvious changes. Many technical personnel have also made some technological innovations in the process of combining with the masses of workers.

    邢台綦村铁矿工人满怀深厚的无产阶级感情
    从政治上关心和帮助下放劳动的干部
    用毛泽东思想给下放干部以再教育，大大提高了他们的政治觉悟，激发了他们向工农兵学习的革命热情，加速了思想革命化的步伐
    新华社石家庄二十六日电　河北省邢台綦村铁矿工人从政治上热情关心和帮助下放劳动的科室人员，用毛泽东思想给他们以再教育，大大提高了下放干部的政治觉悟，激发了他们向工农兵学习的革命热情，加速了他们思想革命化的步伐。
    綦村铁矿实行“精兵简政”以后，在今年七、八月间把百分之六十以上的科室人员下放到各车间、班组参加劳动。广大工人群众认识到帮助干部重新学习是工人阶级义不容辞的责任，在科室人员下放的几天前就作好了准备，热情地为下放干部安排住处，并且根据他们各人的不同情况为他们安排好了劳动岗位。
    这个矿的工人满怀深厚的无产阶级感情，首先从政治上热情关心干部，认真帮助他们解决活思想，促进他们世界观的改造。有的下放科室人员背着“下放劳动不光彩”的思想包袱，人下来了，心没有下来。针对这种活思想，工人们一方面和下放人员一起反复学习毛主席的指示，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义干部路线，提高下放干部的两条路线斗争觉悟和对干部下放劳动的重要意义的认识；一方面对下放干部进行阶级教育，除由苦大仇深的老工人向他们作忆苦思甜报告外，还带领下放人员到附近人民公社的生产队，请老贫农讲述家史、村史和阶级斗争史，提高下放干部的阶级觉悟，增强他们对劳动人民的无产阶级感情。有个干部刚下放到班组时，穿上工作服不愿从人前走。他听了老工人和贫下中农对旧社会的血泪控诉以后深受教育，感到自己是“吃米忘了种谷人，穿衣忘了织布人，劳动人民用血汗把自己养大，如今却忘记了劳动人民，丢掉了劳动人民的本色。”他表示决心要在矿山上安家落户一辈子，彻底改造自己的世界观。他现在感到穿上工作服上山采矿就是最大的光荣，最大的幸福。
    有的下放干部腿脚不硬，腰杆软，担心过不了“劳动关”，怕工人笑话。针对这种思想，工人们首先帮助他们端正对待劳动的态度，就对他们说：“干部首先要把自己摆在普通劳动者的位置上，把思想感情转变到工农兵一边来，放下架子，和我们心往一处想，劲往一处使，汗往一处流，诚心诚意地和我们走一条道。只要态度端正了，劳动的本事是可以学会的。”有个学生出身的干部下到车间很不安心，工人王付魁就遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，主动找他谈心，并和他一起学习了毛主席的教导：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”王付魁还把另两个学生出身的干部下放劳动以后，真心实意地和工人群众相结合的事迹讲给他听，使他深受鼓舞。从此，他在车间安家落户的决心大了，意志更坚定了，改造自己世界观的自觉性更强烈了。
    这个矿的工人还注意对下放干部热情地团结，严格地要求，十分珍视他们之中的积极因素和进步要求。只要他们做出一点成绩，有一些进步，工人们就看在眼里，喜在心里，加以表扬，满腔热情地鼓励他们继续前进。最近，在工人群众的参加下，这个矿从下放科室人员中评选出一批活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子，出席了矿革委会召开的活学活用毛泽东思想经验交流会。
    由于广大工人群众的热情帮助，在短短两个多月的时间里，这个矿下放干部的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟显著提高，精神面貌发生了明显的变化。不少技术人员还在和工人群众相结合的过程中，搞成了一些技术革新。
