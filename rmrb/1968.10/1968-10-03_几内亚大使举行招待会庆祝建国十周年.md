For the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Guinea, Ambassador Segou Camara of Guinea to China held a reception in Beijing today.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, as well as representatives of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of the capital's workers, were invited to attend the reception.

Ambassador Camara and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the reception, expressing their wish for the continuous development and strengthening of the friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea.

Ambassador Segou Camara, in his speech, recounted the achievements of the Republic of Guinea since its declaration of independence. He said that while fighting tenaciously for national survival, the people of his country are justifiably proud of the accomplishments in economic construction and in the social and cultural spheres over the past ten years.

He pointed out that the thorough elimination of colonialism and the consolidation of anti-imperialist African unity are two indispensable conditions for the success of the African revolution. Therefore, we will continue to strive for this together with other brotherly countries that have taken the revolutionary road.

He said that internationally, we have always stood unconditionally on the side of the progressive forces in Asia and Latin America that are opposing foreign rule. We clearly support the Chinese people in liberating Taiwan and bringing it back into the embrace of the motherland, and in expelling the Chiang Kai-shek puppet clique from the United Nations and restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. We have done this in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future, regardless of the time and place.

He said that on the 10th anniversary of our independence, the people of our country are particularly proud to have the People's Republic of China as a reliable friend and comrade. Although China needs to meet its own development needs, it has always kept its promises and, out of the purest and most genuine internationalist sentiments, has provided our country with more and more selfless and effective aid.

The ambassador said on behalf of President Ahmed Sekou Toure, he expressed the deepest gratitude of the people of Guinea to the great people of China and their beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong for the generous aid provided by the People's Republic of China to Guinea. On this occasion, we also express our heartfelt thanks to the Chinese technicians and workers sent to Guinea, who have completed tremendous work in Guinea with a selfless spirit.

In concluding his speech, the ambassador said that we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of our independence at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved decisive victories in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions by establishing revolutionary committees. We are delighted by this great event and wish this cultural revolution even greater success, so that China can make even greater contributions to strengthening the line of struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism by all oppressed peoples.

Vice Premier Chen Yi then spoke, saying that over the past ten years since the people of Guinea gained independence, under the leadership of President Sekou Toure, they have been engaged in unremitting struggles to continue to eliminate colonialist forces, oppose imperialism, oppose foreign interference and subversion, safeguard national independence, and develop national economy and culture, achieving many victories and accomplishments. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, he extended warm congratulations on this and wished the people of Guinea even greater achievements and victories in the years to come.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the current situation of the African people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle is very good. A mighty wave of anti-imperialist revolution is sweeping away the foundations of imperialist rule in Africa.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that imperialism is very afraid of this situation. They are trying every means to sabotage the African people's united anti-imperialist cause, and the Soviet revisionist leadership is also actively playing the role of their accomplice. For a long time, both the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists have pretended to be friends of African countries, but in reality, they have been pursuing a policy of false aid and true control, peddling the goods of neo-colonialism. Recently, the U.S. imperialists' tacit approval of the Soviet revisionists' occupation of Czechoslovakia has fully exposed their evil conspiracy to divide the world and promote neo-colonialism. In Africa, the struggle between the anti-imperialist revolutionary forces and imperialism, modern revisionism, and their lackeys is very complex. However, we believe that as long as we insist on anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, and insist on long-term struggle, the African people who love independence and freedom will surely win the final victory. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle against imperialism as their own victories, and they give enthusiastic support to all their struggles against imperialism and colonialism." In the great struggle of the African people against imperialism and old and new colonialism, the Chinese people will forever be their reliable friends!

He said that over the past two years, under the personal leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. The imperialists' and modern revisionists' delusions of restoring capitalism in China and dragging China back to the old semi-feudal, semi-colonial road have been thoroughly shattered. We believe that after this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our socialist motherland will become even more consolidated and stronger. Our people will have more strength to contribute to the liberation cause of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world.

Vice Premier Chen Yi finally said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have consistently supported and closely cooperated with each other in opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, safeguarding their respective national independence and state sovereignty, and building their respective countries. This embodies the deep combat friendship between the two peoples in the anti-imperialist struggle. We sincerely thank the people of Guinea for their support to the Chinese people. We are deeply convinced that the anti-imperialist combat friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea will continue to strengthen and develop.

Those who attended the reception today also included relevant officials from the Chinese government, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and other relevant departments, such as Xiao Jinguang, Qiao Guanhua, Zhang Xianyao, Wu Ruilin, Chang Qinkun, Zhou Huamin, Xie Huai'de, Zhou Rongguo, Ding Xilin, as well as representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing and representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the garrisoned troops.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    几内亚大使举行招待会庆祝建国十周年
    周恩来总理应邀出席招待会
    卡马拉大使深信文化大革命将使中国对被压迫人民反帝反殖斗争作出更多贡献
    陈毅副总理代表中国人民祝愿几内亚人民在今后的岁月里取得新的成就和胜利
    新华社二日讯　为庆祝几内亚共和国建国十周年，几内亚驻中国大使塞古·卡马拉，今天在北京举行招待会。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，以及首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队代表，应邀出席了招待会。
    卡马拉大使和陈毅副总理在招待会上讲话。他们共祝中、几两国人民的友谊不断发展和巩固。
    塞古·卡马拉大使在讲话中叙述了几内亚共和国宣布独立以来的成就。他说，在为争取民族生存而进行顽强斗争的同时，我国人民为十年来在经济建设和社会、文化方面所完成的事业而感到应有的自豪。
    他指出，彻底消灭殖民主义和巩固反帝的非洲统一是搞好非洲革命的两个必不可缺的条件，因此，我们将继续同其他走上革命道路的兄弟国家一起为此而努力。
    他说，在国际上，我们始终无保留地站在亚洲和拉丁美洲反对外国统治的进步力量一边。我们明确支持中国人民解放台湾，使台湾回到祖国的怀抱，把盘踞在联合国的蒋介石傀儡集团从联合国驱逐出去，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。我们过去是这样做的，今后无论何时何地，我们都将这样去做。
    他说，我国人民在独立十周年的时候，为能有中华人民共和国这样可靠的朋友和同伴而感到十分自豪。尽管中国要满足本身发展的需要，但是中国从来就是遵守诺言的，并且出于最纯洁的真正的国际主义的情谊，给予我国越来越多的、无私的、有效的援助。
    大使说，我代表艾哈迈德·塞古·杜尔总统，向伟大的中国人民及其敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席表示几内亚人民的最深切的谢意，感谢中华人民共和国给予几内亚的慷慨的援助。我们借此机会，向派到几内亚的中国技术人员和工人们表示十分诚挚的谢意，感谢他们以忘我的精神在几内亚完成了巨大的工作。
    大使在结束他的讲话时说，我们是在中国无产阶级文化大革命取得全国各省、市、自治区成立革命委员会的决定性胜利的时候庆祝我国独立十周年的。我们对这一伟大事件感到欢欣鼓舞，并且预祝这场文化革命取得更多的成就，使中国对加强一切为反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义而进行神圣战斗的被压迫人民的战线作出越来越多的贡献。
    陈毅副总理接着讲话，他说，几内亚人民获得独立十年以来，在塞古·杜尔总统领导下，在继续肃清殖民主义势力、反对帝国主义、反对外国干涉和颠覆、维护民族独立、发展民族经济和民族文化等方面进行了不懈的斗争，取得了许多成就和胜利。他代表中国政府和中国人民对此表示热烈祝贺，并祝愿几内亚人民在今后的岁月里不断取得新的成就和胜利。
    陈毅副总理说，当前非洲人民反帝、反殖斗争的形势很好。一个波澜壮阔的反帝革命浪潮，猛烈地冲击着帝国主义在非洲的统治基础。
    陈毅副总理指出，帝国主义十分害怕这种形势。他们千方百计地企图破坏非洲人民的团结反帝事业，苏修领导集团也积极充当他们的帮凶。长期以来，美帝苏修都装成是非洲国家的朋友，实际上他们执行的都是假援助、真控制的政策，他们贩卖的都是新殖民主义的货色。最近，美帝默认苏修占领捷克斯洛伐克的事件，彻底地暴露了他们互相争夺而又互相勾结、妄图划分势力范围、重新瓜分世界、在全世界推行新殖民主义的罪恶阴谋。在非洲，反帝革命力量同帝国主义、现代修正主义及其走狗之间的斗争是十分复杂的。但是，我们相信，只要坚持反帝反殖，只要坚持长期斗争，热爱独立和自由的非洲人民是一定会赢得最后胜利的。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”在非洲人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的伟大斗争中，中国人民将永远是他们可靠的朋友！
    他说，两年来，在中国人民伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导下，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的胜利。帝国主义和现代修正主义妄图在中国复辟资本主义、把中国重新拉回到半封建半殖民地的老路上去的迷梦彻底破产了。我们相信，经过这次无产阶级文化大革命，我们的社会主义祖国将会变得更加巩固，更加强大。我国人民将更有力量为世界被压迫民族和人民的解放事业作出贡献。
    陈毅副总理最后说，中几两国自从建立外交关系以来，在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、维护各自的民族独立和国家主权、建设各自的国家的事业中，一贯相互支持，密切合作，这体现了两国人民在反帝斗争中所结成的深厚的战斗友谊。我们衷心感谢几内亚人民对中国人民的支持。我们深信，中几两国人民的反帝战斗友谊，必将不断加强和发展。
    出席今天招待会的，还有我国政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会等有关方面负责人萧劲光、乔冠华、张贤约、吴瑞林、常乾坤、周化民、谢怀德、周荣国、丁西林，以及北京市各革命群众组织负责成员和驻京部队五好战士代表。
    各国驻中国使节也应邀出席了招待会。
