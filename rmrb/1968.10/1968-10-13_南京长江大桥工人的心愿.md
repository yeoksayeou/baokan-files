On the night of October 5, the living quarters of the Jiangsu workers' delegation were filled with the sound of drums and firecrackers, and everyone was in high spirits, full of joy. Just after seeing Chairman Mao, the old worker Chen Jinshui from the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge construction site sent a telegram back to Nanjing to share the good news, and then wrote a three-page letter with other worker representatives to quickly send back to Nanjing, sharing this greatest happiness with their comrades who remained at their posts.

Chen Jinshui, a worker from a poor peasant background who suffered in the old society, participated in the construction of the Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing Yangtze River bridges after liberation. On the eve of his trip to Beijing to attend the National Day celebrations, he wandered back and forth on the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, deeply moved as he looked at and touched the bridge designed, manufactured, and built by China's working class. His heart was filled with emotion! When he set off for Beijing, the workers of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge sent him off again and again. Everyone gave him countless instructions, asking him to report to Chairman Mao: the bridge builders would respond to Chairman Mao's concern for the working class with actual actions, and the railway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be opened on National Day! On October 1, Chen Jinshui ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum and saw the great leader Chairman Mao. It was at this moment of happiness that the railway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was successfully opened!

In the days and nights beside Chairman Mao, Chen Jinshui's heart was always filled with excitement. He deeply felt that Chairman Mao is closest to us workers, and we workers must follow Chairman Mao the closest. The completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a result of the working class following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to seize the revolution and promote production under the personal care of the great leader Chairman Mao. It is a magnificent victory song of Mao Zedong Thought. With Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, the working class can lead everything and create everything.

Beside Chairman Mao, Chen Jinshui repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "We should be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people," and seriously studied the advanced experiences of the Beijing Knitting Factory and the Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Tsinghua University. He decided to bring back all the advanced experiences of the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the workers in the capital and other parts of the country, learn from them humbly, and use them seriously. He will always follow Chairman Mao closely, making the revolution and construction better and better.

    南京长江大桥工人的心愿
    “我们又见到了毛主席，毛主席他老人家非常非常健康。”
    十月五日夜，江苏工人代表团的住处锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，人人兴高采烈，欢欣鼓舞。刚刚见到毛主席后回到住地的南京长江大桥工地老工人陈金水，满怀激动的心情，立即向南京拍发了报喜的电报，接着又和其他工人代表一起，写了密密麻麻的三页报喜信，飞速寄往南京，和留在战斗岗位上的战友们分享这最大幸福。
    陈金水，这个贫农出身、在旧社会受苦受难的老工人，解放后参加了重庆、武汉、南京三座长江大桥的建设。他到北京参加国庆观礼的前夕，在南京长江大桥上徘徊往返，深情地观看和抚摸着我国工人阶级自己设计、制造、修建的大桥，心情是多么激动！当他出发来北京的时候，南京长江大桥的工人们热情地把他送了一程又一程。大家千叮咛，万嘱托，要他向毛主席汇报：建桥工人们要以实际行动来回答毛主席对工人阶级的关怀，南京长江大桥的铁路桥一定要在国庆节通车！十月一日，陈金水登上了天安门城楼，见到了伟大领袖毛主席。也就是在这幸福的时刻，南京长江大桥铁路桥胜利通车了！
    在毛主席身边的日日夜夜，陈金水心情一直十分激动。他深深感到：毛主席和我们工人最亲，我们工人一定要跟毛主席最紧。南京长江大桥的建成，就是在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，我们工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，抓革命、促生产所取得的成就，是毛泽东思想的一曲壮丽凯歌。有毛主席的英明领导，我们工人阶级就能够领导一切，创造一切。
    在毛主席的身边，陈金水反复学习了毛主席的“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务”的伟大教导，认真学习了北京针织总厂和首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队的先进经验。他决心把首都和全国其他地区的工人兄弟搞好斗、批、改的先进经验全部带回去，虚心地学，认真地用，永远紧跟毛主席，把革命和建设搞得好上加好。
