Worker propaganda teams in Chengdu region prioritize the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary situation in Chengdu's colleges and universities is excellent. Over a hundred colleges and universities in the city, with the exception of a few, have established revolutionary committees.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 20th - Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, hoisting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have been re-educating revolutionary teachers and students, guiding them to better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This has effectively consolidated and developed the excellent revolutionary situation in various schools.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call for the "working class to lead everything," the working class in Chengdu region responded enthusiastically. Under the direct leadership of the Chengdu Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the most outstanding representatives of the working class were selected to form Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, which successively entered over a hundred colleges, universities, and secondary schools in the city. The members of the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, placed the propagation and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. They exercised strong proletarian political leadership over various schools using Mao Zedong Thought. Under the direct leadership and assistance of the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, various schools have generally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the class, teaching and research group, and department levels. In these study classes, the team members led the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students to study, apply, and use Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions. They took class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, with the working class as an example, and severely criticized the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory." They overcame various erroneous tendencies such as individualism, sectarianism, and regionalism among some teachers and students, unified their understanding, steps, and actions according to Mao Zedong Thought, and quickly solved many "old difficult" problems. This consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination from the ideological level, greatly promoting the further development of the excellent revolutionary situation in various colleges and universities. Now, over a hundred colleges, universities, and secondary schools in the city, with the exception of a few secondary schools, have established revolutionary committees.

Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams entering various schools have placed class education in an important position during the process of propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the broad Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students. Many schools' Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have fully utilized the role of old workers and workers with a pure proletarian lineage, recalling bitterness and sweetness with revolutionary teachers and students. The broad Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students have received great education from the comparison between the old and new societies, from the comparison between the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and from recalling the cultivation and education by the Party and Chairman Mao after liberation. This has greatly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

Various schools' Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have deeply felt the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching that "policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party" in practice. They have seriously implemented the proletarian policies towards intellectuals in their work, mobilized all positive factors, united all forces that can be united, fully mobilized the masses, and relied on the masses. They directed the spearhead against a handful of class enemies. Many schools' Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have paid great attention to the role of the school revolutionary committees and the leadership groups at the department, grade, and class levels. When dealing with major school issues, they first discussed with the revolutionary committees, leadership groups, or revolutionary teacher and student representatives. They insisted on: jointly researching and deciding on major issues, exchanging situations and opinions during execution, and unifying views and summarizing experiences after work completion. Some schools' Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have also absorbed the leaders of the school revolutionary committees into the leadership group of the propaganda teams, forming a unified leadership group with workers, the military, and school leaders. This made the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams and revolutionary teachers and students into one force, both playing the leading role of the working class and mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have brought the invincible Mao Zedong Thought into various colleges and universities and secondary schools in Chengdu region. Together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, they have launched a great campaign of the "three eights" style, insisted on the "four firsts," and carried out the "three loyalties" activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This has made these schools' faces completely new. The broad revolutionary teachers and students have expressed their immense excitement, saying they will forever follow Chairman Mao to make revolution and march forward against the waves of class struggle.

    据新华社成都二十日电　进驻成都地区大、专院校和中等学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对广大革命师生进行再教育，引导他们更好地紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，有力地巩固和发展了各学校的大好革命形势。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大号召以后，成都地区工人阶级闻风而动，在成都市革命委员会直接领导下，选出自己最优秀的代表组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，陆续进驻了全市一百多所大、专院校和中等学校。工人毛泽东思想宣传队的队员们，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，把宣传、落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想对各学校实行坚强的无产阶级政治领导。在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的直接领导和帮助下，各学校普遍办起了以班级、教研组、科室为单位的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，宣传队队员们带领红卫兵小将和革命师生活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席一系列最新指示，以阶级斗争和两条路线斗争为纲，以工人阶级为榜样，狠批反动的资产阶级“多中心论”，克服一些师生中的个人主义、宗派主义、山头主义等错误倾向，按照毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，使许多“老大难”问题迅速得到解决，从思想上巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，大大促进了各院、校大好革命形势的进一步发展。现在，全市一百多所大、专院校和中等学校，除了极少几所中学外，都已建立起革命委员会。
    进驻各学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在向广大红卫兵小将、革命师生宣传毛泽东思想的过程中，把阶级教育放在重要地位。许多学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，充分发挥老工人和血统产业工人的作用，同革命师生一起忆苦思甜。广大红卫兵小将和革命师生从新旧社会的对比中，从中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的对比中，从回忆解放后党和毛主席对自己的培养、教育中，受到了很大的教育，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    各校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队在实践中深深体会到毛主席教导的“政策和策略是党的生命”的伟大意义，他们在工作中认真贯彻执行对待知识分子的各项无产阶级政策，调动一切积极因素，团结一切可以团结的力量，充分发动群众，充分依靠群众，把矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人。许多学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，都十分注意发挥学校革委会和系、级、班各级领导班子的作用，在处理学校重大问题时，都事先同革委会、领导小组或革命师生代表共同讨论。他们坚持：重大问题一起研究，共同决定；执行中间交流情况，交换意见；工作结束时统一看法，总结经验。有的学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队还把学校革委会负责人吸收到宣传队的领导小组中来，组成有工人、解放军、学校负责人参加的统一的领导班子，使工人毛泽东思想宣传队和革命师生员工拧成一股绳，既发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，又调动了广大革命师生的革命积极性。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想带进成都地区各大专院校和中学，和广大革命师生一起大兴三八作风，坚持四个第一，深入开展无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，使这些学校的面貌焕然一新。广大革命师生无比激动地表示，要永远跟着毛主席干革命，迎着阶级斗争的风浪向前迈进。
