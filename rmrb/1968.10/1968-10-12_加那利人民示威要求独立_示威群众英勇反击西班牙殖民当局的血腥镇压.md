Canary Islanders Protest for Independence

		Canary Islanders Brave Spanish Colonial Authorities' Bloody Suppression

		According to a communiqué issued by the Canary Islands Movement for Self-Determination and Independence on September 26 in Algiers, the people of Galdar City on Gran Canaria Island held a march and demonstration on September 15, demanding the independence of the Canary Islands.

		The demonstrators, who included workers and residents of Galdar, as well as several hundred farmers, chanted slogans such as "Long live independence" and "Long live a free Canary Islands." The demonstrators bravely fought back against the brutal suppression by the fascist police of the Spanish colonial authorities. A major and a platoon leader of the Spanish colonial police, as well as one policeman, were seriously injured.

		The communiqué of the Canary Islands Movement for Self-Determination and Independence emphasized that the repressive measures taken by Spanish colonialists will never subdue the African people of the Canary Islands. They will use revolutionary violence to counter the counter-revolutionary violence of the Franco regime in Spain.

		The Canary Islands are located in the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Morocco, with a population of about one million and an area of over 7,200 square kilometers. The Canary Islands are still under Spanish colonial rule. For a long time, the Canary people have been fighting against Spanish colonial rule and struggling for national independence.
