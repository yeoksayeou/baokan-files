Our great leader Chairman Mao has instructed us: "Universities must still be run. Here I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering, but the system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and political leadership by the proletariat must be established, following the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant in training technical personnel from among workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then returned to production practice." This instruction is the greatest concern, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for us poor and lower-middle peasants. It greatly boosts our morale and greatly dampens the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. We poor and lower-middle peasants not only must occupy the battlefield of class struggle and production struggle, but also must occupy the battlefield of scientific experimentation! We have the great aspirations of the proletariat, daring to tread paths where none have gone before, daring to scale heights where none have climbed before.

However, for a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has been promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist line on the scientific and technological front, advocating "technical leadership" and "experts are all-powerful." In his mind, only a few bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" who have long been accustomed to being lackeys of foreigners can engage in scientific research, while the broad masses of workers and peasants can only wield hammers and touch cow tails. Hostility towards workers and peasants is the class nature of the Chinese Khrushchev. We poor and lower-middle peasants not only can farm but also can engage in scientific research. If someone doesn't believe it, then please put down your arrogance and come to the countryside to see for yourself!

Our research team consists of thirteen people, most of whom are children of poor and lower-middle peasants, with an average age of twenty-two and an educational level equivalent to fourth grade of primary school. From a young age, we have loved Chairman Mao, loved Mao Zedong Thought, and loved Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We also understand that only by constantly breaking down private interests and establishing public interests can we make contributions to the revolution.

Since the establishment of our research team, we have adhered to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, repelled the frenzied attacks of class enemies, and broken through the obstruction of old habits. Despite their various obstacles and slanders, saying that our scientific experiments are like "toads wanting to eat swan meat," we still followed Chairman Mao's teachings, overcame numerous difficulties, and conducted extensive scientific experimental activities among the masses, achieving certain results. However, an "expert" looked at our newly bred hybrid combinations and said, "Don't mess around, what we can't do, you can't do either, it's labor in vain." We have seen many such figures who look down on workers and peasants and think they are very great. Who can engage in scientific experiments, who is the smartest, let the following facts speak.

In 1965, an "expert" from the Academy of Sciences came to give us a lecture, saying that the technology for configuring sorghum hybrid seeds is complex and difficult to configure, and that only the "accumulated temperature calculation method" can be used to predict the flowering period. As a result, he lectured and lectured, but even he himself was not clear about the calculation of "accumulated temperature," so how could it be applied to production practice? Later, we discarded the foreign doctrines and followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "correct human thought can only come from social practice, only from the three kinds of social practice of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." Based on experimental results, we created a method of using leaf counting to predict the flowering period. Several years of practice have proven that this is an effective method. Our research team has adhered to the path of combining scientific research with production practice, and through variety trials and yield comparisons, we have selected and bred corn double-cross hybrids and sorghum hybrids suitable for local conditions, increasing yield by more than 60% compared to the varieties originally planted by the production teams. We have also bred corn double-cross hybrids resistant to large spot disease, greatly reducing the occurrence of the disease and laying the foundation for increased grain production. We used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to refute foreign "theories," break foreign frameworks, and forge our own path. No one believes the ghost talk of "experts are all-powerful" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev anymore.

Do poor and lower-middle peasants not understand science and technology? Our answer is: Yes, we understand, and not only do we understand, we can do it very well. The likes of the Chinese Khrushchev want the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" to monopolize science and technology, not allowing poor and lower-middle peasants to engage in scientific experiments, making us crawl behind foreigners. We say it's impossible, forever impossible! We poor and lower-middle peasants must occupy the scientific and technological front. In recent years, especially since the Cultural Revolution, we have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," taking class struggle as the key link, and vigorously promoting production struggle and scientific experimentation. Our work has taken a big step forward. In wheat, sorghum, corn, and other crops, we have conducted more than a hundred hybrid varieties and new combinations, and bred some promising new varieties and new hybrids. Our research team has a sixteen-year-old female comrade who has only studied for two years. In the two years she has been in the research team, she has studied and applied the "Three Articles" diligently, constantly breaking down private interests and establishing public interests, and for the revolution, she has mastered a complete set of male-sterile pollination hybrid techniques. Many professional technical personnel's hybrid techniques are not as good as hers. In the past two years, she and her comrades have together conducted more than ninety hybrid combinations of wheat, sorghum, and corn to breed more varieties and hybrids suitable for this region. These facts fully prove that the great truth spoken by our great leader Chairman Mao, "The most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience," is a great truth. As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and apply the boundless enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to scientific research, we can create miracles that the bourgeois lords dare not even think of. Let those fallacies of "poor and lower-middle peasants do not understand science" and "experts are all-powerful" go to hell!

### 贫下中农一定要占领科技阵地

    贫下中农一定要占领科技阵地
    山西省忻县解原公社六石大队科研组
    伟大领袖毛主席指示我们说：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”这个指示是对我们贫下中农最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策，大长了我们的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。我们贫下中农不但要占领阶级斗争、生产斗争的阵地，而且还要占领科学实验的阵地！我们有无产阶级的雄心壮志，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来，在科技战线上推行了一条反革命修正主义路线，鼓吹“技术挂帅”、“专家万能”。在他的心目中，只有当惯洋奴才的少数资产阶级反动学术“权威”才能搞科学研究，而广大的工农群众只能拿榔头、摸牛尾巴。敌视工农，是中国赫鲁晓夫的阶级本性。我们贫下中农，不仅能种地，也能搞科学研究。如果有人不相信，那就请你放下臭架子到农村里来看一看吧！
    我们科研组十三个人，大多数是贫下中农子女，平均年龄二十二岁，文化程度只相当于小学四年级。我们从小就热爱毛主席、热爱毛泽东思想、热爱毛主席的革命路线。我们也懂得，只有不断地破私立公，才能为革命作出贡献。
    我们科研组成立以来，坚持了毛主席的革命路线，击退了阶级敌人的疯狂进攻，冲破了旧的习惯势力的阻挠。尽管他们百般刁难，污蔑我们搞科学实验是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”，我们还是按照毛主席的教导，战胜了重重困难，大搞了群众性的科学实验活动，取得了一定的成绩。可是，一位“专家”看了我们自己新培育的杂交组合后，说什么：“你们不要瞎搞，我们搞不成的，你们搞也不行，是劳而无功。”这种轻视工农、自以为很了不起的人物，我们见过不少。到底谁能搞科学实验，到底谁最聪明，请看下列事实。
    一九六五年，科学院的一位“专家”来给我们讲课，说配制高粱杂交种技术性强，难配制，只有用什么“积温计算法”来预测花期。结果讲了又讲，连他自己都不清楚“积温”的计算，又怎么能用到生产实践中去呢？后来，我们抛开了洋教条，遵照毛主席“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来”的教导，根据实验结果，创造了用叶片计算来预测花期的方法。几年来的实践证明，这是一个行之有效的方法。我们科研组坚持了科学研究和生产实践相结合的道路，经过品种试验和产量比较，选育出了适合本地要求的玉米双交种和高粱杂交种，比生产队原来种植的品种增产百分之六十以上。我们还选育出了抗大斑病的玉米双交种，大大减轻了病害的发生，为粮食增产打下了基础。我们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，驳斥了洋“理论”，打破了洋框框，走出了自己的道路，再也没有人相信中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“专家万能”的鬼话了。
    贫下中农不懂科学技术吗？我们的回答是：懂，不但懂，我们还能搞得很好。中国赫鲁晓夫之流要让资产阶级反动学术“权威”垄断科学技术，不让贫下中农搞科学实验，要我们跟在洋人后面爬行，我们说办不到，永远也办不到！我们贫下中农就是要占领科技阵地。几年来，特别是文化大革命以来，我们响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以阶级斗争为纲，大抓了生产斗争和科学实验，我们的工作又向前跨进了一大步，在小麦、高粱、玉米等作物中共搞了一百多个杂交种和新组合，并培育出了一些有希望的新品种和新杂交种。我们科研组有一个十六岁的女同志，只读过二年书，她到科研组两年来，狠学狠用“老三篇”，不断破私立公，为革命学会了一整套去雄授粉杂交技术，很多专门的科技人员的杂交技术也赶不上她。两年来，她和同志们一起，共搞了小麦、高粱、玉米杂交组合九十多个，以便培育出更适合于本地区的各种作物的新品种和杂交种。这些事实充分证明，伟大领袖毛主席所说的“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”是一个伟大的真理。只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲运用到科学研究中去，就能够创造出资产阶级老爷们连想都不敢想的奇迹。让那些“贫下中农不懂科学”、“专家万能”的谬论见鬼去吧！
