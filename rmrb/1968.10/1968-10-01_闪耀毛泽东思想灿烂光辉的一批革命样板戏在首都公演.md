A grand review of the brilliant achievements of the Cultural Revolution in the struggle, criticism, and reform of the proletarian cultural sphere in our country—revolutionary model operas radiating the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought to be performed in the capital

A new creation and new genre in proletarian revolutionary literature and art—symphonic-accompanied Beijing opera "The Red Lantern" to be performed during the National Day period

Films such as "Heartily Cheering for the Great Leader Chairman Mao's Greatest Concern and Support for the Working Class" will also be screened in the capital

New China News Agency, October 30th—Starting from October 1st, a batch of revolutionary model operas radiating the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought will be performed in the capital. This performance is another grand review of the brilliant achievements of the Cultural Revolution in the struggle, criticism, and reform of the proletarian cultural sphere in our country, and it will add luster to the grand celebration of the 19th anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic of China.

The revolutionary model operas participating in this year's National Day performances include the famous modern revolutionary Beijing operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Harbor," "The Red Lantern," and "Shajiabang," the modern revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang," and the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern."

During the National Day period, the new creation and new genre in proletarian revolutionary literature and art—the symphonic-accompanied Beijing opera "The Red Lantern"—will also meet the audience. The thriving scene on the stage of proletarian literature and art in our country further demonstrates the invincible power of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution. Destruction must be done with reason, and reason is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the cultural sphere of our country, Comrade Jiang Qing led revolutionary literary and artistic warriors, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and waged an unyielding struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. They resolutely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line they promoted, achieving one great victory after another. The modern revolutionary Beijing operas, modern revolutionary ballets, and modern revolutionary symphonies that have emerged on the eastern horizon are the products of smashing the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line and establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line. They are excellent models of struggle, criticism, and reform.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work." Under the leadership of the working class, revolutionary literary and artistic warriors have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and launched a great wave of struggle, criticism, and reform. With boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they have taken the task of rehearsing and performing revolutionary model operas well as a practical action to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. Through their painstaking rehearsals, this batch of revolutionary model operas, which have become shining examples in shaping the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, are even more brilliant.

During the festive days, the capital's cinemas and theaters will screen a batch of newly produced newsreels, including the color documentary "Heartily Cheering for the Great Leader Chairman Mao's Greatest Concern and Support for the Working Class." This film shows the moving scene of the working class in the capital, nurtured under Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, joyfully receiving the precious gifts—mangos—sent by the great leader Chairman Mao. The moving scene of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin receiving the representatives of the capital's workers is also reenacted in this film. The film "The Ship Sails with the Helmsman" documenting the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin receiving the representatives of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works at the first conference of the People's Liberation Army Navy will also be screened during the festival.

The color documentary of the new genre in revolutionary literature and art, the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern," will also meet the broad revolutionary masses during the festival.

    闪耀毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的一批革命样板戏在首都公演
    无产阶级革命文艺新创作、新品种——交响音乐伴奏京剧《红灯记》将在国庆期间演出
    《热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席对工人阶级的最大关怀最大支持》等纪录影片也将在首都放映
    新华社三十日讯　一批闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的革命样板戏，十月一日起将在首都陆续公演。这次演出，是我国文艺界无产阶级文化大革命斗、批、改辉煌成果的又一次大检阅，它将为我们伟大的中华人民共和国成立十九周年的盛大节日增添光辉。
    参加今年国庆演出的革命样板戏，有在中外广大革命人民中久负盛名的革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》，革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》以及钢琴伴唱《红灯记》。
    在国庆期间即将同观众见面的，还有无产阶级文艺新创作、新品种——交响音乐伴奏京剧《红灯记》。我国无产阶级文艺舞台这种繁荣的动人景象，进一步显示了毛主席革命文艺路线无往而不胜的强大威力。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”在我国文艺界两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，江青同志率领革命文艺战士，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人进行了不屈不挠的斗争，坚决批判他们所推行的反革命修正主义文艺路线，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。在东方地平线上出现的革命现代京剧、革命现代芭蕾舞剧和革命现代交响音乐，就是大破反革命修正主义文艺路线、大立毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的产物，是斗、批、改的优秀样板。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”广大革命文艺战士在工人阶级领导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，掀起了伟大的斗、批、改的高潮。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的心情，把排好、演好革命样板戏，作为捍卫毛主席革命文艺路线的实际行动。经过他们精益求精的排练，这批在塑造工农兵英雄形象上成为光辉典范的革命样板戏，更加光彩夺目。
    在万众欢腾的节日里，首都各影剧院将放映一批新摄制成的新闻简报，其中包括彩色纪录影片《热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席对工人阶级的最大关怀最大支持》。从这部影片里可以看到在毛主席光辉思想哺育下成长起来的首都工人阶级，欢欣鼓舞地接受伟大领袖毛主席赠送的珍贵礼物——芒果时的感人场面。伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见首都工人代表的激动人心的场面，也在这部影片中再现。纪录伟大领袖毛主席和林副主席接见出席中国人民解放军海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表的影片《大海航行靠舵手》，也将在节日放映。
    在节日里和广大革命群众见面的，还有革命文艺的新品种钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的彩色纪录影片。
