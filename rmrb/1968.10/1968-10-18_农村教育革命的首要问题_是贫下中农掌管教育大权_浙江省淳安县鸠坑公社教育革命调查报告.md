Under the impetus of the great situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in February this year, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiukeng Commune in Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, followed Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to "revolutionize education" and implemented the management of schools by the poor and lower-middle peasants, and reformed the school system. In just half a year, they changed the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the schools and created a new situation for proletarian education. They believe that the primary issue in rural educational revolution is for the poor and lower-middle peasants to take charge of educational power. Only by solving this problem can Chairman Mao's series of directives on educational revolution be implemented, ensuring that Mao Zedong Thought firmly occupies the educational front in the countryside.

Why Didn't the Old Schools in the Countryside Open Their Doors to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants?

Jiukeng Commune has 1,158 households of commune members with 14 schools, yet as of last year, a large number of children of poor and lower-middle peasants were still excluded from the school gates. Take Shushan Production Brigade, for example: among 186 youths from poor and lower-middle peasant families, 48 were still illiterate. While 13 children of landlords and rich peasants, 10 attended middle school, and 3 graduated from primary school. The three sons of poor peasant Hong Qiguang were all kicked out of school for being a few months over the age limit. Many of the students educated in these schools did not love labor, were not content with rural life, and looked down upon the poor and lower-middle peasants. In Hongwei Production Brigade, more than 50 students with primary and junior middle school education did not want to be accountants, and at the end of the year, they had to pay someone to do the accounting. The poor and lower-middle peasants painfully said that in the past, the schools hung the banner of socialism but practiced capitalist education.

Chairman Mao recently instructed: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Chairman Mao spoke the words in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: In the past, schools did not open their doors to the poor and lower-middle peasants because the educational power was not in our hands.

The poor and lower-middle peasants sharply pointed out: For more than a decade since liberation, schools were still the domain of bourgeois intellectuals, and some were even occupied by ghosts and snakes. A notorious landlord's lackey and geomancer in the commune was even appointed as a "model teacher" by the capitalist-roaders. He often used various excuses to suppress poor peasant students. A little friend named Guan Jiefang was often beaten on the head, forcing him to wear a fur hat to school even in the summer, and was eventually expelled from school. While the two "prodigies" of this "model teacher" became a thief and an active counter-revolutionary after leaving school.

The "intellectual first" and "grades determine everything" revisionist educational system further severely harmed the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. The son of poor peasant Xu Youxiang, after studying for seven years, still could not graduate from primary school, and some teachers even called him a "blockhead." Later, he joined the People's Liberation Army, and in just three months, he could write letters, educating his family to read Chairman Mao's books, and was consecutively rated as a five-good soldier for two years. Xu Youxiang excitedly said: It was not that my son was stupid, but the revisionist educational system harmed him. We poor and lower-middle peasants must seize back the educational power and turn the schools into red Mao Zedong Thought schools like the People's Liberation Army.

The Deep Changes After the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Took Charge of Educational Power

After the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiukeng Commune took charge of managing the schools, they thoroughly smashed the revisionist educational system and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's educational thoughts, causing profound changes in the schools.

First, they completely smashed the "blockade line" against the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. They abolished the age limit for enrollment, implemented spring enrollment, allowed mid-term enrollment, abolished the old promotion and retention system, changed the six-year primary school system to a five-year continuous system, and set up a two-year junior middle school class in the commune central primary school. The curriculum arrangement was closely linked to the work centers of the commune and production brigades and the agricultural seasons, with less study during busy times and more study during idle times, and a complete holiday during the peak season. This school system suited the characteristics of the countryside, and the enrollment rate increased significantly. The number of primary school students increased from 521 last year to 818, and the junior middle school class enrolled 98 students, basically ensuring that all school-age children were enrolled.

Second, they placed reading Chairman Mao's books in the first position, and closely integrated school teaching with the three great revolutionary practices. The poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao the most, understand Chairman Mao's educational thoughts the best, and oppose the practice of studying in isolation from politics and reality. According to their opinions, the schools used Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, universally established the daily reading system, and organized students to actively participate in social activities and collective production labor in a planned manner. For example, they held lectures on the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought with the poor and lower-middle peasants, conducted revolutionary criticism, participated in the struggle against the enemy, and spent one-third of their time participating in collective production labor. Revolutionary teachers and students reflected that such education could both temper red thoughts and learn the true skills of production struggle. In half a year, many students who loved labor, cared for the collective, actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and stood firm in class struggle with clear banners emerged. Seventy-five students were praised by the commune members as "red propagandists." The poor and lower-middle peasants were pleased to see this and said with satisfaction: Such students have strong roots, sturdy stems, and red hearts and will definitely grow into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Third, the teachers walked the path of integrating with workers and peasants. After the schools integrated teaching with the three great revolutionary practices, the teachers were teachers inside the school and students outside the school; they were teachers when giving lessons, and the poor and lower-middle peasants were students when giving lessons; in the past, they were afraid of peasants dirtying them, but now they rolled in the mud with the peasants. Many teachers deeply felt that "the humble are the wisest, and the noble are the most foolish," and "intellectuals, if they do not integrate with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing," changing their past attitude of looking down upon workers and peasants and putting down their airs. Many teachers developed a class feeling of cultivating the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. Students who were late for class were taught as soon as they arrived. Some even bought paper and pens for students in economic difficulties and gave their cotton clothes to students with thin clothing. Some teachers, even when sick, insisted on studying, laboring, and fighting against the enemy with the students. The masses reflected: "We trust such teachers with our children!"

Fourth, the poor and lower-middle peasants were enthusiastic about running the schools and regarded the schools as their own. Many old poor peasants even went up to the podium to teach the students. When the school lacked desks, the commune members voluntarily sent their household tables and chairs. In March this year, when the commune central primary school was building a junior middle school classroom and requested funds from the county, an old poor peasant surnamed Qian went to criticize the school's mistake of asking for help from above and suggested self-reliance. The commune members took the initiative to build, and soon completed six classrooms that could accommodate 300 students.

The changes in Jiukeng Commune vividly showed that the poor and lower-middle peasants must manage the schools and are completely capable of managing them well. Those who think they understand education the most should humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

How Did the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants of Jiukeng Commune Seize Back Educational Power?

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiukeng Commune managing the schools experienced a fierce class struggle. In January this year, when they just started the educational revolution, they encountered resistance from all sides. A handful of class enemies maliciously said, "How can people with knives on their backs manage schools!" Some landlords and rich peasants did not let their children go to school. Many teachers also doubted whether the poor and lower-middle peasants could manage the schools well, always thinking that teaching was still their domain. Facing this situation, linking the class struggle of the past decade between the two educational lines, the poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt that educational power in whose hands served that class. Without seizing educational power, political power was hard to maintain. They were determined to seize back the educational power. So, how did they carry out this struggle to seize power?

First, they broke through the "single-line leadership" of the old educational system and placed the schools under the unified leadership of the commune and production brigade revolutionary committees. The Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in the educational department, in order to turn the schools into a stronghold for restoring capitalism, implemented the "single-line leadership" of the educational system, with the county educational bureau leading the district schools, the district schools leading the complete primary schools, and the complete primary schools leading the village schools. Some even nominally appointed production brigade cadres as village school principals, but in reality, they were just "servants" who helped teachers with bedding when school started and sent luggage when school ended. This "single-line leadership" deprived the poor and lower-middle peasants of the power to manage the schools, making the schools and the commune and production brigades each do their own thing, with you doing your politics, me doing my business, you busy with your production, and me teaching my books. This made school education seriously detached from class struggle and production reality. Jiukeng is a mountainous area producing tea, but the schools followed the unified arrangement of the county according to the rice-growing area's seasons, resulting in the absurd phenomenon of holidays during the slack season and schooling during the busy season.

To break through this black line, the poor and lower-middle peasants decided to establish educational leadership groups composed of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students in the commune and production brigade revolutionary committees to implement unified leadership over the schools. Among the 83 leadership members of the 14 schools in the entire commune, 65% were poor and lower-middle peasants, firmly grasping the educational power. Now, all major work of the schools, such as enrollment, opening school, holidays, curriculum content, educational reform, and teacher appointments and dismissals, are thoroughly studied and discussed by the leadership groups and the poor and lower-middle peasants. This ensured the organizational guarantee for the poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp educational power.

Second, they fiercely criticized the revisionist educational line and reformed the old educational system. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students, with Chairman Mao's educational thoughts as their weapons, focused on several fundamental issues such as for whom the schools should open their doors, what kind of people to cultivate, and who should run the schools, and launched a revolutionary criticism of the revisionist educational system. In more than half a year, the entire commune held more than 700 large and small criticism meetings. They criticized and reformed step by step, implementing Chairman Mao's series of directives on educational revolution.

The poor and lower-middle peasants deeply criticized the "intellectual first" and "grades determine everything" revisionist educational system. They said that this system "does not look at class or person, and a blank paper determines one's fate," making students "heart full of grades and eyes on books," the more they study, the more stupid they become. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings to cultivate "laborers with socialist awareness and culture." Now, the evaluation of students' good and bad performance is first based on their attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, their performance in class struggle, and their attitude towards labor. This implemented the principle of serving proletarian politics with education.

Third, they cleaned up the teacher team and re-educated the teachers. Among the 24 teachers in Jiukeng Commune, 14 were trained after liberation, and 10 were old intellectuals. These teachers, after being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, were mostly willing to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and were determined to carry out the educational revolution to the end. However, due to the poisoning of the revisionist line, these teachers had long been detached from production labor, and their thoughts and feelings were far from the worker and peasant masses, always jumping out of the framework in the educational revolution.

Jiukeng Commune, through the cleanup of the class ranks, removed the bad elements hidden in the teacher team and selected some outstanding young intellectuals to replenish the teacher team. At the same time, they deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, purged the revisionist poison in the teacher team, and re-educated them. They organized teachers and poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in production labor and political activities with a purpose, praised teachers who integrated well with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and encouraged them to firmly walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, greatly promoting the thought revolution of the teacher team. The teachers were determined to carry out the educational revolution with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    农村教育革命的首要问题
    是贫下中农掌管教育大权
    ——浙江省淳安县鸠坑公社教育革命调查报告
    浙江省革命委员会调查组
    在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势的鼓舞下，今年二月，淳安县鸠坑公社的贫下中农，遵循毛主席“教育要革命”的光辉指示，实行由贫下中农管理学校，并且改革了学制。短短半年时间，便改变了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，开创了无产阶级教育的新局面。他们认为，农村教育革命的首要问题，是贫下中农掌管教育大权。只有解决了这个问题，才能保证毛主席关于教育革命的一系列指示得到落实，使毛泽东思想牢牢地占领农村教育阵地。
    农村的旧学校为什么不为贫下中农开门？
    鸠坑公社一千一百五十八户社员，有十四所学校，可是到去年还有大批贫下中农子女被排斥在校门之外。拿树山大队来说，一百八十六名出身于贫下中农的青少年中还有四十八个文盲。而十三个地富子女，有十个读了中学，三个高小毕业。贫农洪其光的三个儿子，都因为年龄超过几个月，被踢出校门。这些学校教出来的学生，有许多不爱劳动，不安心农村，看不起贫下中农。红卫大队有五十多名高小、初中程度的学生，没有一个肯当会计的，年终分配还出钱请人算账。贫下中农痛心地说，过去学校挂的是社会主义牌子，搞的是资本主义教育。
    毛主席最近指示：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席说出了贫下中农的心里话。他们说：过去学校不为贫下中农开门，就是因为教育大权不在我们手里。
    贫下中农尖锐地指出：解放十几年来，学校还是资产阶级知识分子的天下，有的还被牛鬼蛇神占着。一个社里臭名远扬的地主狗腿子、风水先生，竟被走资派封为“模范教师”。他常常以种种借口打击贫农学生。有一个叫管解放的小朋友，因为头部经常挨打，逼得他大热天也戴着皮帽子上学，最后还是被赶出校门。而这个“模范教师”的两个“得意门生”，出校后，一个堕落为盗窃犯，一个成了现行反革命。
    “智育第一”、“分数挂帅”等修正主义教育制度，更是严重地摧残着贫下中农子女。贫农徐有香的儿子，读了七年书，初小还毕不了业，有的教师还说他是“死木头”。后来，他参加了解放军，才三个月，就能写信，教育家庭要好好读毛主席的书，并连续两年被评为五好战士。徐有香激动地说：原来不是我儿子笨，而是修正主义的教育制度坑害人。我们贫下中农一定要夺回教育大权，把学校办成解放军那样红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    贫下中农掌管教育大权后的深刻变化
    鸠坑公社贫下中农掌握管理学校的大权以后，大破修正主义的教育制度，坚决按照毛主席的教育思想办学，使学校发生了深刻的变化。
    一、彻底砸烂了对贫下中农子女的“封锁线”。取消入学年龄限制，实行春季招生，也可以中途入学，废除旧的升留级制度，小学六年改为五年一贯制，公社中心小学附设二年制初中班。课程安排，紧密结合社、队工作中心和农时季节，忙时少学，闲时多学，大忙放假。这种学制，适合农村特点，入学率大大提高。小学生由去年的五百二十一人猛增到八百十八人，初中班已招收九十八人，适龄儿童基本上都入了学。
    二、把读毛主席的书放到第一位，学校教学与三大革命实践紧密结合。贫下中农最热爱毛主席，最理解毛主席的教育思想，最反对脱离政治，脱离实际的关门读书。按照他们的意见，学校把毛主席著作作为基本教材，普遍建立了天天读制度，有计划地组织学生积极参加社会活动和集体生产劳动。例如：同贫下中农一起开活学活用毛泽东思想的讲用会，进行革命大批判，参加对敌斗争，以三分之一的时间参加集体生产劳动。革命师生反映，这样的教育，既能炼红思想，又能学到生产斗争真本领。半年来，涌现出许多热爱劳动，关心集体，积极宣传毛泽东思想，在阶级斗争中立场坚定，旗帜鲜明的好学生。有七十五个学生被社员誉为“红色宣传员”。贫下中农看在眼里，喜在心头，满意地说：这样的学生根正、苗壮、心红，一定能成长为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    三、教师走上了与工农相结合的道路。学校教学与三大革命实践相结合后，教师校内当先生，校外当学生；自己上课是先生，贫下中农上课是学生；过去怕农民碰脏他，现在同农民一起滚泥巴。许多教师都深深感到：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”，改变了以往轻视工农的思想，放下了架子。许多教师有了热情培养贫下中农子女的阶级感情。学生因事迟到，随到随教。有的还给经济困难的学生买纸、笔，拿自己的棉衣给衣衫单薄的学生穿。有的教师有病，仍坚持与学生一同学习，一同劳动，一同参加对敌斗争。群众反映：“把孩子交给这样的老师，我们信得过！”
    四、贫下中农热心办学，把学校看成了自己的学校。许多老贫农还登上讲台，给学生上课。学校缺少课桌，社员自动把家用的桌凳送去。今年三月，公社中心小学建造初中班教室，要求县里拨款，一位姓钱的老贫农得知后，特地赶去批评了学校向上伸手的错误，建议自力更生。社员们自己动手，很快就建成了能容纳三百学生的六个教室。
    鸠坑公社的变化，生动地说明了贫下中农必须管理学校，并且完全能够管好学校。那些自以为最懂教育的人，应当老老实实地拜贫下中农为师。
    鸠坑公社贫下中农是怎样夺回教育大权的？
    鸠坑公社贫下中农管理学校，经历了一场激烈的阶级斗争。今年一月，他们刚刚插手教育革命，就遇到来自各方面的阻力。一小撮阶级敌人，胡说什么
  “屁股挂柴刀的人怎能管学校！”有的地主富农就不让孩子上学。不少教师也怀疑贫下中农能管好学校，总以为教书这一门，还得听他们的。面对这种情况，联系十几年来两条教育路线触目惊心的阶级斗争，使贫下中农深深感到，教育大权在那个阶级手里，教育就为那个阶级服务。文权不夺，政权难保。他们决心把教育大权夺过来。那么，他们是怎样进行这场夺权斗争的呢？
    一、冲破旧文教系统的“单线领导”，把学校置于社、队革委会的统一领导之下。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育部门的代理人，为了变学校为复辟资本主义的阵地，推行教育系统的“单线领导”，由县文教局领导区校，区校领导完小，完小领导村校。有的名义上也叫生产队干部担任村校校长，实际上是开学给教师接铺盖，放假为教师送行李的“服务员”。这种“单线领导”剥夺了贫下中农管理学校的大权，使学校与社、队各自为政，你搞你的政治，我干我的业务，你忙你的生产，我教我的书。使学校教育严重脱离阶级斗争和生产实际。鸠坑是个生产茶叶的山区，学校却由县统一按照水稻地区季节放农忙假，这就出现了农闲放假，农忙读书的怪现象。
    为了冲破这条黑线，贫下中农决定，在社、队革命委员会设立由贫下中农和革命师生组成的教育领导小组，对学校实行一元化的领导。全公社十四所学校的八十三名领导成员中，贫下中农占百分之六十五，牢牢地掌握了教育大权。现在，学校的一切重大工作，如招生、开学、放假、课程内容、教育改革和教师任免等，都通过领导小组和贫下中农的充分研究和讨论。这就从组织上保证了贫下中农掌握教育大权。
    二、狠批修正主义教育路线，改革旧的教育制度。贫下中农和革命师生，以毛主席的教育思想为武器，围绕着学校为谁开门，培养什么样的人，靠谁办学等几个带根本性的问题，对修正主义的教育制度展开了革命的大批判。半年多来，全社开了大小批判会七百多次。他们边批边改，逐条落实毛主席关于教育革命的一系列指示。
    贫下中农深刻地批判了“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”的修正主义教育制度。他们说，这种制度“不看阶级不看人，一张白纸定终身”，害得学生“心怀分数，眼看书本”，越读越蠢。我们必须按毛主席的教导，培养“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。现在评定学生好坏，首先看对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的态度，看阶级斗争中的表现，看劳动态度。贯彻了教育为无产阶级政治服务的方针。
    三、清理教师队伍，对教师进行再教育。鸠坑公社二十四个教师，其中十四个是解放后培养出来的，十个是旧知识分子。这些教师，经受了无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，大多数人愿意为工农兵服务，决心把教育革命进行到底。但是，由于修正主义路线的毒害，这些教师长期脱离生产劳动，思想感情与工农群众有很大距离，在教育革命中，总是跳不出框框。
    鸠坑公社通过清理阶级队伍，清除了隐藏在教师队伍中的坏人，选拔了一些优秀的知识青年充实教师队伍。同时深入开展革命大批判，肃清教师队伍中的修正主义流毒，对他们进行再教育。有目的地组织教师和贫下中农一起参加生产劳动和政治活动，表扬与贫下中农结合得好的教师，鼓励他们坚定地走与工农相结合的道路，大大促进了教师队伍的思想革命化，教师们决心和贫下中农一起把教育革命进行到底。
