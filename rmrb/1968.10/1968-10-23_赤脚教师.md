One evening this past spring, Chen Kaiwan, an old poor peasant from the Eighth Production Brigade of Yongfeng Brigade in Guanghui Commune, lay in bed tossing and turning, unable to sleep. The commune's primary school had recently established an affiliated junior middle school class, and the poor and lower-middle peasants had taken over the management of the school. They had elected him as an outside part-time teacher to teach agricultural production knowledge. He was to start teaching the next day, with his first lesson being on rice seed sowing.

How should he teach this lesson well? He thought and thought. He thought about the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev meeting, where poor and lower-middle peasants had exposed and denounced him. The old educational system was truly harmful, he thought. The children of poor and lower-middle peasants had barely entered school and read a few years, only to become lazy, looking down on physical labor and the laboring people who gave birth to them. The system that Chinese Khrushchev promoted was clearly trying to win over the next generation. If things continued this way, wouldn't we have to suffer twice and retrace our steps? This time, everyone elected me, a "big roughneck" who had never even entered a school gate, to teach. It was to seize the next generation and truly cultivate them into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. With this in mind, his confidence grew, his spirits soared, and he had a plan for his teaching.

The next day, Chen Kaiwan came to the school. Instead of starting with how to sow seeds, he began by discussing for whom to sow seeds. He started by asking, "In the old society, for whom did we sow seeds? For whom did we farm?" He continued, "We sowed seeds and farmed for the landlords. One year, it was also this season, I was farming seedlings for the landlord. My feet were cracked open, and I still had to do heavy work in the fields. The wounds got bigger and bigger, and blood flowed freely. At night, the pain was so bad that I cried holding my feet. After a year of hard work, there still wasn't any rice in the pot during the New Year! Now, we are sowing seeds on our own commune's land, sowing for the revolution, for the country, for socialism. We must study hard to master the technology of sowing seeds and produce more grain to support the country and the world revolution." Only then did he turn to teaching the technical aspects of sowing seeds. The students listened attentively and learned eagerly, receiving both class education and agricultural knowledge.

After Chen Kaiwan finished his classroom lecture, he immediately took the students to the fields for practical operation, teaching them one by one until they all mastered the technique. The students worked and sweated alongside him, raising their ideological standards and learning the technology. Many students returned home and actively participated in collective production labor, eagerly studied production technology, and actively studied Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The commune members proudly said, "The students we poor and lower-middle peasants teach are completely different from the past." The school's teachers praised him for "bringing the technical course to life." Some affectionately called him the "barefoot teacher" and took him as an example to learn from.

    “赤脚教师”
    今年春天的一个晚上，光辉公社永丰大队八生产队老贫农陈开万，躺在床上翻来复去睡不着。公社完小新近办起了附设初中班，贫下中农管理了学校，大家推选他为校外兼职教师，讲授农业生产知识课。他明天就要去上课，第一课是水稻撒种。
    该怎样上好这一课呢？他想呀，想呀，他想到批判中国赫鲁晓夫大会上贫下中农的揭发和控诉，越想越激动。旧教育制度真是害死人，贫下中农的子女好不容易进了学校，读上几年书，反而变得四体不勤，瞧不起体力劳动，瞧不起生他养他的劳动人民。中国赫鲁晓夫搞的这一套，不是明明在和我们争夺下一代吗？照这样下去，我们不是又要吃二遍苦，走回头路吗？这次大家推我这个连学校门也没进过的“大老粗”去讲课，就是要我把下一代夺过来，真正把他们培养成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。想到这里，他信心大了，劲头足了，上课的办法也有了。
    第二天，陈开万来到学校，他不是先讲怎样撒种，而是先讲为谁撒种。他一开始就提出问题说：“旧社会我们为谁撒种？为谁种田？”他接着讲道：“我们是为地主撒种，为地主种田。有一年，也是这个季节，我为地主办秧田，双脚裂了口，还得下田干重活，伤口越裂越大，鲜血直流，晚上痛得抱着脚哭。这一年辛苦到头，过年时还没有米下锅！现在，我们是在自己公社的土地上撒种，是为革命、为国家、为社会主义撒种，我们一定要下狠心钻研撒种技术，多打粮食支援国家，支援世界革命。”然后他才转到讲授如何撒种的技术。学生听得特别专心，学得格外有劲，既受了阶级教育，又学到了农业知识。
    陈开万在课堂讲完之后，立即带着学生到田间实地操作，他把着手一个个地教，直到全都学会为止。学生们同他一起出力流汗，既提高了思想，又学会了技术。许多学生回家后积极参加集体生产劳动，积极钻研生产技术，积极和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作。社员们自豪地说：“我们贫下中农教出来的学生，就是和过去大不相同。”学校的教师称赞他“把技术课上活了”。有的亲热地称他为“赤脚教师”，把他作为学习的榜样。
