Dare to Uphold the Truth
Worker Li Lianrong from Beijing Morning Light Electric Machine Factory

Chinese Khrushchev, in his frenzied attempt to restore capitalism, has been pushing a counter-revolutionary revisionist line for building the Party. He has been vigorously promoting the idea of servility, poisoning Party members with his vicious "tool theory," attempting to strangle the thorough revolutionary spirit of Communist Party members and turn them into "tame tools" for his restoration of capitalism. This is utterly reactionary. His agent in our factory has stipulated that Party members must study his black book "Self-Cultivation" both before and after joining the Party, telling them to "cultivate themselves" and follow the capitalist-roaders unquestioningly. At the same time, he has been trying every means to bring bad elements into the Party. In our factory, there is a rightist who had his cap removed, always playing a double game. Whatever the capitalist-roaders say, he nods his head and says, "Yes! That's correct!" The capitalist-roaders say he is a "reliable person, obedient," and not only promoted him but also wanted to cultivate him into the Party, even saying that such a person joining the Party is "worth ten worker Party members." We firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Communist Party members must always be ready to uphold the truth," and have waged a resolute struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. When introducing him to the Party, I said, "Such a two-faced rightist cannot join the Party!" The capitalist-roader then used his authority to suppress me, saying, "There are instructions from above, 'Develop one or two rightists who have just had their caps removed to join the Party, set an example for rightists, and give them a future.'" I refuted him, saying, "Chairman Mao has long given instructions, 'The Communist Party of China is the core of leadership for all the people of China.' Developing the Party is for the cause of the proletarian revolution, not to set an example for rightists and find them a future." Because the majority of Party members resolutely supported my opinion, his plot did not succeed. From then on, this capitalist-roader bore a grudge against me, putting pressure on me, finding faults with me for no reason, giving me a hard time, and picking on me. But I thought about how I had upheld the truth of Mao Zedong Thought and defended Chairman Mao's line for building the Party, and my heart was filled with joy.

Through these struggles, I have further come to understand that Chinese Khrushchev and his agents promote the "tool theory" precisely to strangle the proletarian revolutionary spirit of Party members, deceive and force Party members to deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and turn Party members into lifeless, smooth-tongued "good-for-nothings." This is to preserve the "waste" within the Party and bring class enemies from outside into the Party, preparing conditions to change the nature of the Party and restore capitalism. But this will never be achieved!

We understand that as long as there is class struggle, class struggle within the Party will never stop. The most basic task of Party members is to lead the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses in struggling against the class enemy and carrying out the socialist revolution. Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of the "tool theory" is to obliterate class and class struggle, obliterate the sharp class struggle within the Party, and abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must thoroughly settle accounts with the heinous crimes of Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, completely expose and criticize the "tool theory," and eliminate all its poison, fighting to the end to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    要敢于坚持真理
    北京曙光电机厂工人　李连荣
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，疯狂推行一条反革命修正主义建党路线。他大肆鼓吹奴隶主义，向党员拚命灌输恶毒的“驯服工具论”，妄图扼杀共产党员的彻底革命精神，变成他复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”，真是反动透顶。他在我们工厂的代理人，规定党员入党前和入党后都必须学习他的黑《修养》，要党员“修身养性”，对走资派唯命是从。与此同时，又千方百计地要把一些坏人往党内拉。我们厂有一个摘帽右派分子，一贯耍两面三刀，走资派不管说什么，他都点头哈腰说“好！非常正确！”走资派却说他是个“可靠的人，听话”，不但提拔了他，还要培养他入党，竟说什么这样的人入党“一个要顶十个工人党员”。我们牢记毛主席“共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理”的伟大教导，和党内一小撮走资派进行了坚决的斗争。在介绍他入党时，我说：“这样两面三刀的右派不能入党！”走资派就仗势压制我说：“上面有指示，‘发展一两个刚摘了帽子的右派分子入党，要为右派分子树立一个标兵，使他们有前途’。”我反驳他说：“毛主席早有指示，‘中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。’发展党，是为了无产阶级革命事业，不是为右派分子树标兵找前途的。”由于大多数党员坚决支持我的意见，使他这个阴谋没有得逞。从此，这个走资派对我怀恨在心，向我施加压力，有事没事找我的岔子，给我小鞋穿，揪住辫子就整我。但是，我想到自己坚持了毛泽东思想的真理，捍卫了毛主席的建党路线，心中特别高兴。
    通过这些斗争，使我进一步认识到中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人鼓吹“驯服工具论”，就是为了扼杀党员的无产阶级革命精神，蒙骗和强迫党员背离毛主席的革命路线，把党员变成死气沉沉的、八面玲珑的“老好人”，好让他们把党内的“废料”保存下来，把党外的阶级敌人拉进来，为改变党的性质和复辟资本主义准备条件。但这是永远办不到的！
    我们懂得，有阶级斗争存在，党内的阶级斗争就不会停止。党员的最基本任务就是带动无产阶级和广大革命群众向阶级敌人进行斗争，搞好社会主义革命。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“驯服工具论”，就是抹煞阶级和阶级斗争，抹煞党内存在着的尖锐的阶级斗争，取消无产阶级专政。我们必须彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的滔天罪行，把“驯服工具论”批倒批臭，把余毒消除干净，为捍卫毛主席革命路线战斗到底。
