The Party Committee of a company in the 4627 Unit of the People's Liberation Army has earnestly grasped the proletarian policy, focused on addressing living thoughts, and helped college graduates who came to the company to consciously transform their worldviews, fully mobilizing the positive factors of intellectuals.

According to a report from this newspaper, the Party Committee of a company in the 4627 Unit of the People's Liberation Army, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "students trained in old schools, the majority or a large majority of whom can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have made inventions and innovations. However, they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must give them re-education to thoroughly change their old ideas," has grasped the policy, focused on addressing living thoughts, and warmly carried out re-education for intellectuals who came to the unit. They have helped them consciously transform their worldviews, effectively promoting the ideological revolutionization of intellectuals.

Ten college graduates who came to this company in succession have, through the patient help of the Party Committee, undergone significant changes in their ideological appearances and made notable progress on the road of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers. University students who participated in the initial evaluation were all rated as five-good soldiers, and most became cadres for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Some were even set as advanced examples for the company.

Raise Awareness, Correct Attitudes, and Warmly Carry Out Re-Education for Intellectuals

In February of this year, after a batch of college graduates came to the company, most of the soldiers welcomed them warmly, but some comrades showed signs of reluctance, not very happy to accept them. Some said, "University students have theories and know foreign languages; we rough soldiers can't handle them!" Others said, "These soft-skinned intellectuals, all talk and no action, can't do anything. We still have to do their ideological work. Accepting them is just trouble for our company." The Party Committee believed that these living thoughts reflected that some comrades' understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line was still shallow, their hatred for the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev was not deep enough, and their understanding of the significance of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals was not clear. This was a concrete manifestation of low awareness of the struggle between the two lines. This problem had to be solved to carry out re-education for intellectuals well.

Facing this situation, the Party Committee organized the soldiers to seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution and cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. They mobilized the masses to deeply criticize the revisionist educational line. During the criticism, college graduates and young intellectuals in the company used their personal experiences to angrily denounce the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's agents in the school, who poisoned the youth with ideas of fame and wealth and the old educational system. Graduate Li Chengliang said, "I was born into a poor peasant family and, in 1960, with a strong desire to defend the socialist homeland, entered a certain college in Harbin. As soon as I entered the gate, the Chinese Khrushchev's agents in the college instilled in us the idea of studying for advanced fields, graduating to become cadres, eating well, and dressing warmly. They lured us away from proletarian politics, production labor, and workers, peasants, and soldiers, resulting in us ruining our health, becoming nearsighted, and having many bourgeois dust in our minds." Fact after fact stirred up the soldiers' deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, further raising their awareness. Everyone realized that earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary line and carrying out re-education for intellectuals was a sharp class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a matter of great importance for consolidating proletarian dictatorship, preventing capitalist restoration, and ensuring that our socialist homeland would never change color. Everyone said, "The majority of these young intellectuals from colleges are our class brothers. They are the direct victims of the bourgeois educational line. Helping them out of the bourgeois educational line's quagmire is a glorious task given to us by the great leader Chairman Mao. We must resolutely complete it."

After raising awareness, all the officers and soldiers in the company regarded carrying out re-education for intellectuals as their duty and responsibility. They actively and consciously approached them emotionally and politically. The Party Committee often held meetings to discuss this work, actively creating favorable conditions for intellectuals to change their old ideas. Whenever a batch of intellectuals came, the company would, just like welcoming new recruits, give them the first gift of Chairman Mao's revolutionary works, the first lesson of studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" together, and the first talk with the company commander and political instructor introducing the glorious revolutionary traditions of the PLA. As soon as they arrived in the platoon, the old soldiers would actively pair up with them in "red pairs." These activities deeply moved the college graduates, who said, "Coming to the company, everywhere is warm, everyone is a relative, just like coming home."

Focus on Living Thoughts, Enhance Awareness, and Guide Intellectuals to Seriously Transform Their Worldviews

Chairman Mao taught us, "The transformation of worldviews is a fundamental transformation." The Party Committee believed that uniting and educating intellectuals, the most fundamental thing was to use Mao Zedong Thought to change their bourgeois ideas and establish a proletarian worldview. These college graduates, after coming to the company, were active and enthusiastic. However, due to the deep poisoning of the bourgeois educational line, they had many vague understandings about accepting re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers and could not turn their thoughts around immediately. Some thought that since they came from good backgrounds and grew up under the red flag, they were neither bourgeois academic "authorities" nor old intellectuals, and there was nothing to transform. Some thought that since they had participated in the "Four Clean-ups" and the Cultural Revolution, they had already been transformed, and now they were going down to the company for tempering, which was truly "endless learning, endless supplementary courses, and endless graduation." Some also thought that they had studied scientific frontiers in school, while the company was engaged in training and farming, "theory" and practice could not be combined, and they were worried that they would lose their skills after learning labor. The Party Committee believed that these living thoughts reflected that they still had insufficient understanding of the poisoning of the bourgeois educational line and low awareness of accepting re-education, which was the biggest obstacle to transforming their worldviews.

To make intellectuals consciously accept the transformation in the fundamental issue of worldviews, the Party Committee repeatedly organized them to study Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and teachings on educational revolution with questions in mind, to examine their bourgeois ideas accepted under the influence of the bourgeois educational line, to see the unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao of soldiers from worker and peasant backgrounds, to find the gap in their worldview transformation, and to guide them to learn from workers and peasants bit by bit and to transform their worldviews bit by bit according to the proletarian worldview. In the practice of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers and learning from them, they increasingly clearly saw the poisoning of the bourgeois educational line on themselves. They said, "Although we come from laboring people's families and have undergone some tempering, we have received bourgeois education for more than ten years in school, making us emotionally distant from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and our evil thoughts of pursuing fame and wealth are increasingly serious. In life, we crave comfort and enjoyment more and more, and in study, we connect with ideological and practical struggles less and less. The transformation of our worldviews is far from being as conscious as that of soldiers from worker and peasant backgrounds. In the future, we must honestly accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers and thoroughly change our old ideas."

Grasp the Policy, Praise First, and Mobilize the Positive Factors of Intellectuals to Accept Re-Education

Chairman Mao recently pointed out, "Students trained in old schools, the majority or a large majority of whom can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers." The Party Committee deeply felt in the practice of uniting and educating intellectuals that to earnestly carry out re-education for intellectuals, it was necessary to firmly act according to the proletarian policy formulated by Chairman Mao and fully mobilize the positive factors of intellectuals. Therefore, the Party Committee often educated the officers and soldiers to use a two-line approach to view intellectuals, seeing both the side poisoned by the bourgeois educational line and the side eager to progress. They paid attention to discovering their small progress and promptly giving praise. University student Li Yunxiang, while weeding, exerted his greatest effort, sweating all over, but still could not catch up with the other comrades. However, the platoon leader still praised him in the evaluation for his spirit of not fearing hardship and fatigue and daring to undergo tempering in the labor, deeply educating and inspiring Li Yunxiang, making him more determined to transform himself. To encourage their progress, the Party Committee consciously cultivated and set up examples among them, continuously propagating to lead and promote other comrades.

The Party Committee also often educated the officers and soldiers to see both the urgency of intellectuals accepting re-education and their original foundation. Starting from reality, they persuaded and guided, protecting their enthusiasm and not demanding too much or acting too hastily. After intellectuals came down to the company, the first difficulty they encountered was labor. Initially, some comrades said, "University students are here to be transformed, so they should be given hoes and pulled to do hard work." The Party Committee promptly corrected this impetuous mood. In labor, the Party Committee consciously adopted the "two helps one" method, with two old soldiers helping one university student, both setting an example for them and taking care of them physically. Some university students, when they first came to the company, were not bold enough to expose their thoughts and fight against themselves when studying Chairman Mao's works. Facing this situation, the Party Committee mobilized the cadres to lead the way in exposing and fighting against themselves in the platoon and, through carrying out heart-to-heart talks, individually enlightened and helped them, gradually raising their awareness of self-revolution. University students generally reflected, "The Party Committee cares about us and trusts us. We have truly become members of the company." The officers and soldiers of the company also praised them, "At first, they were cautious intellectuals, but now they have become good cadres for building the company."

    遵照毛主席教导满腔热情地对知识分子再教育
    人民解放军四六二七部队某连认真掌握无产阶级政策，狠抓活思想，帮助来连队的大专院校毕业生自觉地改造世界观，充分调动了知识分子的积极因素
    本报讯　解放军四六二七部队某连党支部，遵照毛主席关于“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想”的教导，掌握政策，狠抓活思想，满腔热情地对来部队的知识分子进行再教育，帮助他们自觉地改造世界观，有力地促进了知识分子的思想革命化。
    先后来这个连队的十名大专院校毕业生，经过党支部的耐心帮助，思想面貌发生了很大的变化，在与工农兵相结合的道路上有显著的进步。参加初评的大学生，全部被评为五好战士，大部分成为宣传毛泽东思想的骨干，有的还被树为连队的先进典型。
    提高认识，端正态度满腔热情地对知识分子进行再教育
    今年二月，一批大专院校毕业生来到连队以后，多数指战员对他们表示热烈欢迎，但也有的同志流露出畏难情绪，不大高兴接收他们。有的说：“大学生有理论，会洋文，咱这大老粗可拨弄不了！”有的说：“这些白面书生，娇皮嫩肉，光说不练，啥也干不了，还得做他们的思想工作，接收了他们，不是给咱连队找麻烦吗？”党支部认为，这些活思想反映了有些同志对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线理解还不深，对中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线恨得还不够，对团结、教育和改造知识分子的意义认识还不清，这是两条路线斗争觉悟不高的具体表现，这个问题不解决，就不能搞好对知识分子的再教育。
    针对这种情况，党支部便组织部队指战员们认真学习毛主席关于教育革命和培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的教导，发动群众深入开展了对修正主义教育路线的大批判。在大批判中，大专院校的毕业生和连队里的知识青年，用个人的亲身经历，愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫用名利思想和旧教育制度毒害青年的滔天罪行。毕业生李呈良同志说：“我出身在贫农家庭里，一九六○年满怀保卫社会主义江山的强烈愿望进了哈尔滨某学院。一进大门，中国赫鲁晓夫在学院的代理人就给我们灌输上大学攻尖端，毕了业‘当干部，吃得香，穿得暖’的名利思想，引诱我们脱离无产阶级政治，脱离生产劳动，脱离工农兵，结果害得我们把身体搞垮了，眼睛近视了，思想里也染上了很多资产阶级的灰尘。”一件件活生生的事实，激发了指战员们对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，进一步提高了大家的觉悟。大家认识到，认真贯彻执行毛主席的教育革命路线，对知识分子进行再教育，是无产阶级同资产阶级争夺知识分子的一场尖锐的阶级斗争，是关系到巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，保证我国社会主义江山永不变色的千年大计、万年大计。大家说：“从大专院校出来的这些知识青年，绝大多数是我们的阶级兄弟，他们是资产阶级教育路线的直接受害者，对他们进行再教育，帮助他们从资产阶级教育路线的泥坑里拔出腿来，这是伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的光荣任务，我们一定要坚决完成。”
    认识提高以后，全连干部战士都把对知识分子进行再教育看成是自己义不容辞的责任，自觉地、主动地从感情上亲近他们，从政治上帮助他们。党支部经常开会研究这项工作，为知识分子改变旧思想积极创造有利条件。每来一批知识分子，连里便和欢迎新战士入伍一样，第一件礼物，就是向他们赠送毛主席的革命宝书，第一堂课是同他们一起学习《为人民服务》，第一次谈话是连长、指导员向他们介绍解放军的光荣革命传统。他们一到班里，老战士就主动和他们结成
  “一对红”。这些活动，使大专院校的毕业生深受感动，他们说：“来到连队处处都很温暖，个个是亲人，就象到了自己的家。”
    抓好活思想，增强自觉性引导知识分子认真改造世界观
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。党支部认为，团结和教育知识分子，最根本的一条就是用毛泽东思想去改变他们的资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级世界观。这些大专院校毕业生，到连队以后，积极上进，热情很高。但是由于他们受资产阶级教育路线毒害较深，对接受工农兵的再教育，存在着不少模糊认识，在思想上一时还转不过弯来。有的认为自己出身好，长在红旗下，既不是资产阶级学术“权威”，也不算旧知识分子，没有什么可改造的；有的认为自己搞过“四清”，参加过文化大革命，已经改造过了，现在又下连锻炼，真是“上不完的学，补不完的课，毕不完的业”；也有的认为，自己在学校里学的是科学尖端，连队搞的是练兵种田，“理论”和实际结合不起来，担心学了劳动，丢了技术。党支部认为，这些活思想反映了他们对自己受资产阶级教育路线的毒害认识还很不足，接受再教育的自觉性还不高，这是改造世界观的最大障碍。
    为了使知识分子在世界观这个根本问题上自觉接受改造，党支部反复组织他们带着问题学习毛主席一系列最新指示和关于教育革命的教导，检查自己在资产阶级教育路线影响下接受的资产阶级思想，看工农出身的战士无限忠于毛主席的高贵品质，找自己在世界观改造上的差距，引导他们一点一滴地向工农学习，一点一滴地按照无产阶级世界观改造自己的世界观。在与工农兵结合、向工农兵学习的实践中，使他们越来越清楚地看到了资产阶级教育路线对自己的毒害。他们说：我们虽然是劳动人民出身，也受过一些锻炼，但是，在学校里受了十几年资产阶级教育，使我们在感情上离工农兵群众越来越远，追求名利地位的恶劣思想越来越严重，在生活上贪安逸、图享受的现象越来越多，在学习上联系思想实际和斗争实际越来越少，世界观的改造远远比不上工农出身的战士那样自觉，今后一定老老实实地接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变旧思想。
    掌握政策，表扬为主调动知识分子接受再教育的积极因素
    毛主席在最近指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的”。党支部在团结教育知识分子的实践中深刻体会到，要切实搞好对知识分子的再教育，必须坚决按照毛主席制定的无产阶级政策办事，充分调动知识分子的积极因素。因此，党支部经常教育干部、战士，用一分为二的观点看待知识分子，既看到他们受资产阶级教育路线毒害的一面，又看到他们迫切要求进步的一面。注意发现他们的微小进步，及时给予表扬。大学生李允祥在锄地时，尽了最大努力，累得浑身是汗，还是赶不上其他同志。但是，班长在讲评中仍然表扬了他在劳动中不怕苦、不怕累，勇于艰苦锻炼的精神，使李允祥深受教育和鼓舞，更加坚定了改造自己的信心。为了鼓励他们进步，党支部有意识地在他们中间培养和树立典型，经常不断地进行宣传，以典型引路，带动和促进其他同志。
    党支部还经常教育部队指战员，既看到知识分子接受再教育的迫切性，又要看到他们原有的基础。从实际出发，循循善诱，保护他们的积极性，不能要求过高，操之过急。知识分子下连后，遇到的第一道难关就是劳动。起初，有的同志说：“大学生是来改造的，就得给他们锄头，拉着干累活。”党支部及时纠正了这种急躁情绪。在劳动中，党支部有意识地采取“两帮一”的办法，由两个老战士，帮一个大学生，既给他们做出样子，又从体力上照顾他们。有的大学生刚到连队时，学习毛主席著作亮私不大胆，斗私不勇敢。针对这种情况，党支部便发动骨干，一方面在班里带头亮私、斗私，一方面通过开展谈心活动，进行个别启发帮助，使他们逐渐提高了自我革命的自觉性。大学生们普遍地反映：“党支部既关心我们，也信任我们，我们真正成了连队里的一员。”连队的指战员们也赞扬他们：“乍来时是谨小慎微的知识分子，现在变成了建设连队的好骨干。”
