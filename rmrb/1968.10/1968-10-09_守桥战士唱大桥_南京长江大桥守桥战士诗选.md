	Bridge Guards Sing of the Bridge
	—Selections from the Poems of the Bridge Guards of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge

	Long Live Chairman Mao Forever!

	Five Good Soldiers	Mǎ Qìngshēng

	The sun rises in the east, red flags flutter,
	The ten-thousand-meter bridge shines brightly.
	On National Day, good news is reported,
	Trains rumble across the great river.
	The great victory shakes the world,
	Songs and laughter fill the Yangtze River.
	The bridge builders sing of battling waves,
	The road builders praise the Party with all their hearts,
	Chairman Mao commands the building of the great bridge,
	Ten thousand songs and melodies sing to the red sun!

	The northbound trains carry the soldiers' wishes:
	Sincerely wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!

	Everything for Chairman Mao
	Five Good Soldiers	Xú Jīnróng

	Build the bridge for Chairman Mao,
	Lay the tracks for Chairman Mao,
	Drive the train well for Chairman Mao,
	Stand guard well for Chairman Mao...
	Everything for Chairman Mao,
	The revolutionary ideal is the highest;
	Cut through the wind and waves with boundless strength,
	Command the Yangtze River to make way!

	Sunlight Shines on the Bridge for Ten Thousand Miles
	Five Good Soldiers	Hóng Jiāfǎ

	The red flag rises and floats in the clouds,
	The Yangtze River's ten thousand waves are split;
	The great people create miracles,
	Sunlight shines on the bridge for ten thousand miles.

	One Heart to Guard the Bridge
	Soldiers	Wáng Zhàowén Zhuāng Héngmín

	A red sun shines in the heart,
	A steel gun is held firmly,
	One bridge pier, one sentry post,
	One heart to guard the bridge.

	Steel Bridge Piers and Red Sentry
	Soldier	Xú Zhōngnián

	The red sun shines forever in the heart,
	The steel gun in the hand is firm and steady,
	Steel bridge piers and red sentry,
	Unshaken by surging waves.

	Night Patrol
	Five Good Soldiers	Wáng Rúxǐ

	The river is full of water, the sky is full of stars,
	The speedboat sails through the river,
	Eyes wide open, ears attentive,
	The waves roar, but it feels even quieter,
	The night is vast, but it feels even brighter,
	Guard the bridge, offer loyalty...
	The shore is lit up with red lights,
	The river's waves are swift and turbulent,
	Class struggle is firmly remembered,
	Chairman Mao's teachings are etched in the heart.
	Fight against the wind and waves, march forward,
	Chairman Mao commands me to patrol at night!

	Songs Roll Up Ten Thousand Waves
	Five Good Soldiers	Sūn Xiàngdōng

	The sun rises from the East Sea, shining golden light,
	The bridge builders ascend the great bridge,
	Ten thousand people sing "The East Is Red",
	Songs roll up ten thousand waves!
