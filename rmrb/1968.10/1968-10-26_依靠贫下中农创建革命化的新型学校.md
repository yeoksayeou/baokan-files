In accordance with the brilliant "May 7th Directive" and the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao on the proletarian educational revolution, 120 poor and lower-middle peasants from Yangqiao Commune in Fenyi County, Jiangxi Province, formed 33 Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams and entered all the schools in the commune. A mass movement for educational revolution swept rapidly through the entire commune, smashing the old educational system and creating a new-type proletarian school guided by Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive," taking the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example, and using the three great revolutionary practices in the countryside as the classroom. The number of schools in the entire commune increased from the original 51 to 84. The existing teaching staff underwent rectification and reform. The poor and lower-middle peasants have firmly grasped the power of rural education, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the schools has disappeared forever.

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Must Grasp the Power of Rural Education

For a long time, due to the implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, the power of rural education was basically controlled by bourgeois intellectuals. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The old schools only recognized grades, not class status, and were not open to the poor and lower-middle peasants." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Louxia Production Brigade said that in the past, because they did not grasp the power of education, they could not cultivate their own intellectuals. Since the establishment of the high-level cooperative, they have not been able to hire a genuine accountant who serves the poor and lower-middle peasants. The first accountant demanded 30-plus yuan per month, and every year he had to be subsidized with several tens of yuan when he returned home. After serving for a few years, he embezzled a sum of money and left behind a mess of accounts before disappearing. The second accountant was a bad element who engaged in speculation. The third accountant also had serious political problems. The poor and lower-middle peasants said that this was the result of not grasping the power of education, and this account should be settled with the Chinese Khrushchev.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest understanding of the harm caused by the revisionist educational line and the greatest hatred for the old educational system. They pointed out with precision: In the past, schools were not for revolution but for becoming officials. The children of poor and lower-middle peasants who entered such schools would remain the same after one year, change after two years, and transform after three years. Rural students who studied in the city for more than ten years learned mathematics, physics, and chemistry but did not want to use hoes and rakes, looked down on the countryside, looked down on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and did not want to return home to participate in productive labor. How can such people inherit the revolutionary cause? They also said that those who came out of the old schools were neither literate nor martial. After finishing middle school, they could not count, operate machinery, or handle a plow (for farming). They could not even distinguish the twenty-four solar terms of a year, but only learned to put on airs. They were truly becoming more stupid the more they learned, misleading the younger generation.

A former high school graduate from Fenyi Middle School who returned to the countryside to engage in agricultural production had a deep understanding: "I studied in school for more than ten years and became more revisionist. When I was in primary school in the village, I wore cloth shoes and went barefoot without feeling anything; when I studied in Yangqiao for junior high, I felt that cloth shoes were not good-looking, so I bought cloth that cost more than eight jiao per yard to make a new set of clothes; when I studied in the county for senior high, I changed even more, using things like snow lotion. Sometimes, when my relatives from home came to see me, they wore bare feet and cloth shoes, and called my childhood name in front of my classmates, which made me feel ashamed. This shows that although I came from a poor and lower-middle peasant family, my thoughts and feelings had changed." This young student later returned to the countryside for productive labor and received re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now, he deeply feels: "Education must be thoroughly revolutionized, and rural schools must be managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Relying on the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants to Establish New-Type Schools

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangqiao Commune, through studying Chairman Mao's proletarian educational thoughts, further criticized the revisionist educational line, and further realized the importance of grasping the power of education. Each production brigade in the entire commune established a Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Educational Revolution Committee, directly grasping the political direction of the schools and managing all the power of the schools.

The poor and lower-middle peasants, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "shorten the school system," changed the original six-year primary school system to a five-year system and the six-year three-three segmented middle school system to a four-year two-two segmented system. The commune established a nine-year continuous school, each production brigade established a seven-year continuous school, and each production team established a five-year continuous school. Basically, each team has a school, students studying senior high school do not leave the commune, students studying junior high school do not leave the brigade, and students studying primary school do not leave the production team. This makes it convenient for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enroll in school. In the past, students studying junior high school had to bring money, grain, oil, and bedding to the school to board, but now they can enroll nearby, study in school, live at home, and work in the team, combining school education, social education, and family education. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very satisfied and said: "This is truly doing things for the poor and lower-middle peasants, bringing the school to the doorstep." To enable children who herd cattle and pick pigweed to also go to school, some brigades even established noon classes and night classes. Many poor and lower-middle peasant children who could not enroll in school in the past can now go to school. The entire commune can quickly achieve universal primary education among school-age children.

The content and methods of school education have also undergone thorough reforms. Students not only learn literature but also agriculture, military affairs, and criticize the bourgeoisie. The school of Jianshan Production Brigade took the students to the "Yu Gong Field" and "Dazhai Mountain" where the commune members were working on the land, taught the story of "Yu Gong Moves the Mountain," and after class, participated in labor. The leaders of the commune and brigade revolutionary committees gave political classes to the students, spreading Chairman Mao's latest instructions; old poor peasants told their family and village histories, the brigade supervision chiefs taught classes on class struggle, militia cadres taught military classes, experienced old farmers taught production technology classes, and accountants taught abacus and accounting classes. The time for classes and labor was also flexibly arranged according to the agricultural season and weather changes. Each school seriously learned from the People's Liberation Army, organizing students into platoons, companies, and squads according to military organization, and establishing Red Children's Teams among children aged seven to fifteen. The organizational discipline of the students was greatly strengthened. The broad revolutionary masses enthusiastically praised the schools managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, saying: "This is a school where the poor and lower-middle peasants have the say, it's great, and the talents cultivated by this school are the successors of the revolutionary cause." An old poor peasant from Louxia Production Brigade had a son who studied up to the fourth grade in the old school, and he did not let him continue. He said: "Don't ruin my son." Teachers visited his home five times to persuade his son to go to school, but he did not agree. After the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the school, he said: "Now the school is run by us poor and lower-middle peasants, it's trustworthy." He happily sent his son to school.

Acknowledging or Not Acknowledging the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Managing Schools is a Struggle Between Two Lines and Two Worldviews

When Yangqiao Commune began to implement the poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools, the class enemies immediately spread malicious rumors, saying things like "illiterates managing schools will only teach students to not recognize a single character," "now the schools can't learn anything." Within the revolutionary ranks, there were also a few people who had insufficient understanding of the leading role of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural educational revolution. Many school cadres and teachers also had varying degrees of resistance, with some having a negative attitude and others simply refusing to manage. Facing this situation, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of poor and lower-middle peasants who entered the schools mobilized revolutionary teachers and students to deeply engage in struggles against the enemy, thoroughly criticizing a handful of class enemies. The vivid facts of class struggle deeply educated the revolutionary teachers and students. At the same time, the commune and brigade revolutionary committees and the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of poor and lower-middle peasants held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously spreading Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the educational revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students further realized that whether or not to follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants, whether or not to acknowledge the poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools, is a struggle between two educational lines and two worldviews, and a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

In the educational revolution, a common problem faced by each brigade was: the number of schools increased, the number of students increased, but there were not enough school buildings and equipment. At the beginning, some people wanted to wait slowly until all conditions were met before starting classes, while others wanted to reach out to higher authorities to request funds. The question was whether to follow old practices, seek grandeur and foreign influence, and emphasize "standardization," or to uphold the spirit of thorough revolution, bravely break out of the old circle, and follow the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" path. This was a struggle between two lines and two thoughts in the educational revolution. The commune revolutionary committee timely guided everyone to follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "self-reliance" and "thrift for revolution," relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants to adjust housing and quickly establish schools. There were not enough chairs, so students were mobilized to bring their own. There were no desks, so brick supports and wooden boards were used as substitutes. In this way, the entire commune increased 33 schools and nearly 5,000 students without asking the state for a single cent.

    依靠贫下中农创建革命化的新型学校
    江西分宜县杨桥公社贫下中农组成毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻学校，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为指针，以抗大为榜样，以农村三大革命实践为课堂，创办新型学校，取得显著成绩
    本报讯　遵照伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示和一系列无产阶级教育革命的最新指示的精神，江西省分宜县杨桥公社的一百二十名贫下中农组成了三十三个毛泽东思想宣传队进入全公社所有的学校，全公社迅速掀起了一个教育革命的群众运动，砸烂了旧的教育体制，开创了以毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示为指针，以抗大为榜样，以农村三大革命实践为课堂的无产阶级的新型学校。全公社的学校从过去的五十一所发展到八十四所，对原有的教师队伍进行了整顿和改造。农村教育大权已经牢牢地掌握在贫下中农手里，资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象一去不复返了。
    贫下中农必须掌握农村教育大权
    长期以来，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行反革命修正主义教育路线，农村的教育大权基本上被资产阶级知识分子所把持。贫下中农说：“过去的学校只认分数，不认阶级，根本不是为贫下中农开门的。”楼下大队的贫下中农说，过去由于我们没有掌握教育大权，不能培养自己的文化人，大队会计要从外面请来。自从办起高级社，我们没有请到过一个真正能为贫下中农服务的会计。第一个会计，要三十多元钱一个月，他每年回家还得补助几十元钱，当了几年会计，贪污了一笔钱，丢下了一笔糊涂账就走了。第二个会计又是个专搞投机倒把的坏分子。第三个会计也有严重的政治问题。贫下中农说，这就是吃了没有掌握文权的亏，这笔账要算在中国赫鲁晓夫身上。
    广大贫下中农对修正主义教育路线的危害了解最深，对旧教育制度最痛恨。他们一针见血地指出：过去的学校，读书不是为了革命，而是为了当官。贫下中农子女进了那样的学校，一年保本色，二年要褪色，三年变颜色。农村学生在城里读了十几年书，学了数理化，不要锄头耙，看不起农村，看不起贫下中农，不愿回家参加生产劳动。这样的人怎么能接革命事业的班？他们还说，从旧学校出来的人，文不能文，武不能武，读了中学，一不会算盘子，二不会开机子，三不会掌牛鞭子（耕田），连一年二十四个节气都分不清，只学会了摆架子。真是越学越蠢，误人子弟。
    回乡参加农业生产的原分宜中学的一个高中毕业生深有体会地说：“我在学校读了十几年书，越来越修。在村里读小学时，穿土布衣服打赤脚不觉得什么；到杨桥念初中，就觉得土布衣服不好看，买了八角多钱一尺的布做了件新的；到了县城读高中，就更加变了，雪花膏之类的东西也用上了。有时，家里的亲人来看我，打一双赤脚，穿土布衣服，当着同学的面叫我的乳名，就觉得丢了脸。这说明，我虽然出身贫下中农，思想感情已经变了。”这个青年学生以后回乡生产劳动，接受贫下中农的再教育。现在，他深深地感到：“教育必须彻底革命，农村学校必须由贫下中农管理。”
    依靠贫下中农创建新型的学校
    杨桥公社的贫下中农，通过大学毛主席的无产阶级教育思想，大批修正主义教育路线，更进一步认识到掌握教育大权的重要性，全公社各大队成立了贫下中农教育革命委员会，直接掌握学校的政治方向，统管学校的一切大权。
    贫下中农根据毛主席“学制要缩短”的教导，把原来的小学六年制改成五年制，中学六年三三分段制改为四年二二分段制。公社办了一所九年一贯制的学校，各生产大队办七年一贯制的学校，生产队办五年一贯制的学校。基本上做到队队有学校，学生念高中不出公社，念初中不出大队，念小学不出生产队。这样就方便了贫下中农子女的入学。过去学生读初中要带钱、带粮、带油、带被子到学校寄宿，现在就近入学，读书在校，住宿在家，劳动在队，把学校教育、社会教育和家庭教育结合起来了。贫下中农非常满意地说：“这真正是为贫下中农办事，把学校办到了家门口”。为了使放牛和打猪草的小孩也能读书，有些大队还办了中午班和夜班，许多过去不能入学的贫下中农子女都能上学，全公社很快就可以在适龄儿童中普及小学教育。
    学校的教育内容和教育方法也进行了彻底改革。学生不但学文，而且学农，学军，批判资产阶级。建坡大队的学校把学生带到社员正在队里治山的“愚公田”“大寨山”，讲“愚公移山”，上完课就参加劳动。社队革委会负责人为学生上政治课，宣传毛主席的最新指示；苦大仇深的老贫农讲家史、村史，大队监管主任讲阶级斗争课，民兵干部讲军事课，有实践经验的老农讲生产技术课，财会人员讲珠算课和会计业务。上课和劳动时间也根据农事季节和天气变化作灵活安排，各学校认真学习解放军，学生按连、排、班实行军事编制，在七至十五岁的儿童中成立红色儿童团，学生的组织纪律性也大大加强了。广大革命群众热情赞扬贫下中农管理的学校，他们说：“这是贫下中农说了算的学校，好得很，这种学校培养出来的人才是革命事业的接班人。”楼下大队有个老贫农，儿子在旧学校读到四年级，他就不让再读了，说：“莫坑害了我儿子。”教师到他家里动员了五次，要他儿子上学，他都不答应。贫下中农管理学校以后，他说：“现在的学校是我们贫下中农自己办的，信得过。”就高高兴兴地把儿子送到学校。
    承认不承认贫下中农管理学校是两条路线、两种世界观的斗争
    杨桥公社开始实行贫下中农管理学校的时候，阶级敌人便放出阵阵阴风，说什么“文盲管学校，总会管得一个字都不认得”，“现在的学校学不到什么东西”。在革命队伍里，也有少数人对贫下中农在农村教育革命中的主力军作用认识不足。不少学校的干部和教师也有不同程度的抵触情绪，有的态度消极，有的干脆撒手不管。针对这种情况，进驻学校的贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队，就发动革命师生深入开展对敌斗争，深挖狠批一小撮阶级敌人。活生生的阶级斗争事实，使学校革命师生受到了深刻的教育。同时，社队革委会和贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真宣传毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示。革命师生进一步认识到，走不走与工农相结合的道路，承认不承认贫下中农管理学校，是两条教育路线、两种世界观的斗争，是忠不忠于毛主席的大问题。
    在教育革命中，各大队普遍碰到的一个问题是：学校增加了，学生增多了，校舍、设备不足怎么办？开始时，有的人想慢慢来，等条件齐全了再上课，有的想向上伸手要求拨款。是因循守旧，求大求洋，讲“正规化”，还是发扬彻底革命精神，勇敢地跳出旧圈子，走“抗大”的道路，这是教育革命中两条路线、两种思想的斗争。公社革委会及时引导大家遵照毛主席“自力更生”、“要节约闹革命”的教导，依靠贫下中农，调整住房，迅速把学校办起来。凳子不够，就动员学生自己带，桌子没有，就用土砖支撑木板代替。这样，全公社共增加了三十三所学校，近五千学生，没有向国家伸手要一分钱。
