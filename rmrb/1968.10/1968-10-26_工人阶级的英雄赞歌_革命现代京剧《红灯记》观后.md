The spring breeze and willows sway in countless strands, and the revolutionary situation is boundlessly good. Under the great commander Chairman Mao's order that "the working class must lead everything," the vast army of industrial workers, heads held high, strides forward, marching into the realms of culture, education, and all other superstructures. A magnificent new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation is upon us. At this great moment, watching the China Peking Opera Troupe's performance of the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Lantern," I was greatly inspired and felt particularly close to it.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class has the most foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." The revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Lantern" deeply and perfectly portrays the towering image of the working class hero Li Yuhe, a magnificent ode to the Chinese working class.

Li Yuhe has "the most foresight." The story of "The Red Lantern" takes place in 1940, when Japanese imperialism had already occupied half of China, and the Chinese nation was at a critical juncture of life and death. Due to the betrayal of a traitor, Li Yuhe was "arrested and imprisoned." Even at this time, Li Yuhe still had "ambitious aspirations that soar to the heavens." He was on the execution ground, but he thought of the bright future, believing that the proletariat would ultimately achieve victory: "After the storm, a hundred flowers bloom, new China is like the morning sun, shining upon the world," fully demonstrating the working class's foresight.

Li Yuhe is "selfless." He dedicates himself to the revolution, everything for the revolution. To "free the tens of millions of compatriots from suffering," he "is not afraid to sit in prison until the end," and "is willing to be crushed to pieces." He bravely fights, not hesitating to sacrifice his life. Li Yuhe's every word and deed shines with the light of selflessness.

Li Yuhe is "the most thorough in revolution." To achieve a thorough victory for the revolution, he fears neither heaven nor earth, "advances forward unyieldingly," "fights the enemy tenaciously," and "would rather have his bones shattered than turn back his head," fully embodying the spirit of the working class's thorough revolution.

Li Yuhe is an excellent representative of the working class, and "The Red Lantern" is an ode to the heroism of the working class.

The heroes on stage and the struggles below the stage are truly more and more familiar, more and more exciting. Remembering the past, how many Li Yuhes, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, led the masses to drive out darkness and welcome light; looking at the present, how many Li Yuhes, following the orders of the great commander Chairman Mao, carry forward the glorious tradition of the February 7th strike, moving from one victory to another. In the "support left" work, I have encountered countless living "Li Yuhes." I deeply feel that the working class is the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, the bravest in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the most resolute in carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions. The working class must lead everything, and the working class can lead everything.

The great leader Chairman Mao points out: "The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious." In the "support left" work, we must firmly rely on the working class, fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

    工人阶级的英雄赞歌
    ——革命现代京剧《红灯记》观后
    广州铁路局革委会主任广州部队炮兵副司令员  刘占荣
    春风杨柳万千条，革命形势无限好。在伟大统帅毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的号令下，浩浩荡荡的产业工人大军，昂首阔步，开进文化、教育和其他一切上层建筑领域，一个气势磅礴的斗、批、改新高潮到来了。在这个伟大的时刻，观看了中国京剧团演出的革命现代京剧《红灯记》，受到极大鼓舞，感到格外亲切。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”革命现代京剧《红灯记》，深刻而完美地塑造了工人阶级的英雄战士李玉和的高大形象，是中国工人阶级的一曲壮丽颂歌。
    李玉和“最有远见”。《红灯记》的故事发生在一九四○年，当时，日本帝国主义已经侵占了大半个中国，中华民族正处于生死存亡的关头。由于叛徒的出卖，李玉和“被捕在牢房”。即使在这样的时候，李玉和还是“雄心壮志冲云天”，他身在刑场，想到的是光明的未来，相信无产阶级能够最后取得胜利：“风雨过，百花吐艳，新中国，似朝阳，光照人间”，充分表现了工人阶级的远见。
    李玉和“大公无私”。他一心为革命，一切为革命。为了“要使那几万万同胞脱苦难”，他“不怕把牢底来坐穿”，“粉身碎骨也心甘”，英勇奋斗，不惜献出自己的生命。李玉和的一言一行，都闪耀着大公无私的光辉。
    李玉和“最富于革命的彻底性”。为了使革命取得彻底的胜利，他天不怕地不怕，“前仆后继走向前”，“不屈不挠斗敌顽”，“宁可筋骨碎，决不把头回”，充分发扬了工人阶级的彻底革命的精神。
    李玉和是工人阶级的优秀代表，《红灯记》是工人阶级的英雄赞歌。
    看台上的英雄人物，想台下的斗争生活，真是越看越亲切，越看越激动。忆往日，多少个李玉和，在中国共产党的领导下，带领着广大人民群众，驱逐黑暗，迎来光明；看今朝，又有多少个李玉和，遵照伟大统帅毛主席的号令，发扬“二·七”大罢工的光荣传统，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。在“支左”工作中，我接触了许许多多活着的“李玉和”。我深深地体会到：工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席最忠诚，捍卫毛主席的革命路线最勇敢，执行毛主席的指示最坚决。工人阶级就是要领导一切，工人阶级就是能够领导一切。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”我们在“支左”工作中必须坚定不移地依靠工人阶级，充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
