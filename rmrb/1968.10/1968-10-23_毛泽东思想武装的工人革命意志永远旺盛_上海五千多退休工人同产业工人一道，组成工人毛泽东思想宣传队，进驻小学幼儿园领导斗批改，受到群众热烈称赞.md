More than 5,700 retired industrial workers in Shanghai, together with a large number of employed industrial workers, formed a massive army of workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They entered all the primary schools and kindergartens in the city to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

These old workers, who had deep bitterness and a clear class hatred from the old society and had rich experience in struggle, played a significant role in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They were praised by people as good teachers for re-educating revolutionary teachers and students, old heroes in the fight against enemies, and good instructors for strengthening the ideological construction of the workers' propaganda teams.

After receiving the notice to go to the schools to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the retired old workers were all very excited. They expressed their determination to complete the glorious and arduous task given by Chairman Mao, to transform the schools into red Mao Zedong Thought schools. Before entering the schools, they criticized the "retirement enjoyment" ideology advocated by China's Khrushchev. They said, "We may be old, but our hearts are not old. Although we have retired, our thoughts must not retire. We must follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize for life."

After entering the schools, the retired old workers, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, generally gave reports to the revolutionary teachers and students about their experiences of contrasting the old and new societies, conducting class education. One day, a kindergarten in Luwan District was about to have snacks. Retired worker Wang Lanying brought two items: coarse cakes and biscuits. She first asked the children to eat a small piece of the coarse cake and then the biscuit. Wang Lanying, with tears in her eyes, said to the children, "Children, when I was your age, I couldn't even eat such coarse cakes, let alone biscuits! Now you live so happily, first of all, you should thank Chairman Mao, thank the Communist Party! You must listen to Chairman Mao, study hard, and progress every day!"

The retired old workers often had heart-to-heart talks with teachers and students and conducted home visits. A teacher at Kaifeng Road Primary School was worried that her daughter would be assigned to work outside the city and was depressed every day. Retired worker Zhang Gen'ei from the workers' propaganda team learned about this and took the initiative to talk to her. This old female worker, who had experienced many hardships, talked about how she had given birth to six children in the old society, but they were all tormented to death by the evil old society. After liberation, she had another daughter and lived a happy life. A few years ago, she sent her only daughter to the border to participate in the construction of the motherland without hesitation. She said, "My daughter is the property of the party and the state, and I should hand her over to the party." The female teacher was moved and said, "I must learn from Mother Zhang and hand over my children to the party."

These retired old workers not only gave lectures on class education but also educated teachers and students with their actions after class. They saw blocked drains and rolled up their sleeves to clear them; they saw dirty classrooms and picked up brooms to clean them. The young teachers were very moved.

There are many young intellectuals in primary schools and kindergartens, and they lack experience in fighting against a small group of class enemies. The retired old workers were veterans in past political movements and had deep hatred for class enemies. After entering the schools, they actively participated in the struggle and criticism activities, bringing about an unprecedented new situation in the schools' fight against enemies. One day, at a struggle meeting at Kaifeng Road Primary School, a landlord openly argued, "I, this landlord, do not exploit peasants." Retired worker and member of the workers' propaganda team Qian Ya'er heard this and was so angry that he jumped onto the stage, rolled up his trouser leg, and pointed to the scar on his leg, saying angrily, "This scar is the result of being beaten by a landlord, and this is the iron-clad evidence of landlords oppressing the laboring people! Crows are all black, how can there be a landlord who does not exploit peasants!" He then listed a large number of facts he had personally experienced, exposing the landlord's crimes and refuting the landlord's arguments, leaving him speechless. Those class enemies who had once been arrogant were exposed as paper tigers in front of the old workers with rich experience in struggle.

The retired old workers not only actively participated in the fight against enemies but also did a lot of work in mobilizing the masses. For a long time, the class struggle cover in Shaping Road Primary School could not be lifted, and the masses had many concerns. A counter-revolutionary was at large. After the workers' propaganda team entered the school, they were determined to lift the class struggle cover in this school. At a teachers' study and discussion meeting, retired worker Shen Yindi talked about her tragic family history in the old society. She said, "Who saved us? It was the great leader Chairman Mao! Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, I will fight to the death!" The teachers were deeply moved. They said, "We are afraid of this and that, but we never thought that if we do not grasp class struggle, capitalism will restore!" The masses quickly took action and lifted the class struggle cover.

These retired old workers with deep bitterness are also active learners of Chairman Mao's works. Whenever they have time, they study Chairman Mao's instructions. If they are illiterate, they ask others one word at a time. Many vivid examples show that these retired old workers love Chairman Mao, love Mao Zedong Thought, and love Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are not only models for revolutionary teachers and students but also models for the ideological revolution of the workers' propaganda teams.

    毛泽东思想武装的工人革命意志永远旺盛
    上海五千多退休工人同产业工人一道，组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻小学幼儿园领导斗批改，受到群众热烈称赞
    据新华社上海二十二日电　上海有五千七百多名退休产业工人同大批在职产业工人一道，组成浩浩荡荡的工人毛泽东思想宣传队大军，开进全市各小学和幼儿园，领导这些地方的斗、批、改。
    这批在旧社会里苦大仇深、有鲜明的阶级爱憎和丰富斗争经验的老工人，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队中发挥了很大的作用，被人们称赞为对革命师生进行再教育的好老师，对敌斗争的老英雄，加强工人宣传队思想建设的好指导员。
    退休老工人接到请他们到学校领导斗、批、改的通知后都非常激动，他们表示一定要完成毛主席交给的光荣而艰巨的任务，把学校改造成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。在进驻学校前，他们批判了中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的退休“享福”思想。他们说，我们人老心不老，人虽退休了，思想绝不能退休，一定要跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
    退休老工人进驻各校后，怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，普遍对革命师生作了控诉旧社会、热爱新社会的回忆对比的报告，进行阶级教育。有一天，卢湾区一个幼儿园的小朋友们快到吃点心的时候，退休老工人王兰英拿来了两样东西：糠饼和饼干。她先请小朋友吃一小块糠饼，再吃饼干。王兰英含着眼泪对孩子们说：“小朋友，我象你们那样大的时候，连这样的糠饼也吃不上，哪来的饼干啊！现在你们生活得这样幸福，首先要感谢毛主席，感谢共产党！你们一定要听毛主席的话，好好学习，天天向上！”
    退休老工人还经常找师生谈心，进行家庭访问。开封路小学一位教师担心女儿要分配到外地去，整天闷闷不乐。工人宣传队的退休老工人张根娣知道后，就主动找她谈心。这位饱经风霜的老女工谈到，解放前她生过六个孩子，但是一个个都被万恶的旧社会折磨死了。解放后她又生了一个女儿，生活得很幸福。前几年她毫不犹豫地把这个独生女儿送到边疆参加祖国的建设。她说：“我这个女儿是党和国家的财产，我应该把她交给党。”这位女教师听了张根娣的话激动地说：“我一定要向张妈妈学习，把子女交给党。”
    这些退休老工人既能上台讲阶级教育课，又能在下课后以实际行动教育师生。他们见阴沟堵塞了，就卷起袖子通阴沟；见教室脏了，就拿起扫帚打扫。青年教师看了很受感动。
    小学、幼儿园里青年知识分子多，在同一小撮阶级敌人作斗争时缺乏经验。退休老工人在过去的历次政治运动中是闯将，对阶级敌人有刻骨的仇恨。进学校后，他们积极参加斗批活动，使学校的对敌斗争出现了前所未有的新局面。一天，在开封路小学的一次斗争大会上，一个地主分子公然狡辩说：“我这个地主是不剥削农民的。”退休老工人、工人宣传队员钱雅兔听后，气得跨上讲台，卷起裤管指着腿上的伤疤愤怒地说：“我这个伤疤就是给地主毒打出来的，这就是地主压迫劳动人民的铁证！天下乌鸦一般黑，那有地主不剥削农民的！”接着，他列举大量亲身经历过的事实，揭露地主的罪恶，把这个地主分子批得哑口无言。那些曾经嚣张一时的阶级敌人，在有丰富斗争经验的老工人面前，都露出了纸老虎的原形。
    退休老工人不但自己积极投入对敌斗争，而且做了大量的群众发动工作。沙虹路小学长期来阶级斗争盖子揭不开，群众顾虑重重，一个现行反革命分子逍遥法外。工人宣传队进校后，决心把这个学校阶级斗争盖子揭开。在教师学习讨论会上，退休工人沈银娣和大家谈了自己在旧社会的悲惨的家史，她说：“是谁救了我们？是伟大领袖毛主席！谁要反对毛主席，我拚老命也要和他斗到底！”听了沈银娣的话，教师们感受很深。他们说：“我们怕这怕那，可就没想到不抓阶级斗争，资本主义就会复辟！”群众很快行动起来，揭开了阶级斗争盖子。
    这些苦大仇深的退休老工人，也是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。他们一有空，就学习毛主席的指示。文化低，不识字，就一字一句地问别人。他们热爱毛主席、热爱毛泽东思想、热爱毛主席无产阶级革命路线的许多生动事例表明，这些退休老工人不仅是革命师生的表率，也是工人宣传队思想革命化的表率。
