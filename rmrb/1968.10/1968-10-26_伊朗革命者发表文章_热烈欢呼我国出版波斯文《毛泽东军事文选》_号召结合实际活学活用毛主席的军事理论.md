Iranian revolutionaries recently published an article enthusiastically hailing the publication of the Persian edition of "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" by our country. The article states: "Now, the military theories of Comrade Mao Zedong, in the entire world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have opened up the path to victory for people's wars, guiding us to defeat the reactionaries, imperialists, and revisionists of various countries."

The article, titled "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong—The Sharpest Ideological Weapon for the Liberation of the Peoples of All Countries," states that the publication of Mao Zedong's works in Persian is a "concrete manifestation of internationalist aid to our people."

The article points out that the military theories of Comrade Mao Zedong are the military science of the proletariat, and that "the theory of people's war is an important component of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought." The article concludes by expressing that the Iranian revolutionary people "must combine these theories with practice and study and apply them actively."

The Persian edition of "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" was recently published by the Beijing Foreign Languages Publishing House.
