In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the midst of the joyous celebration of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a magnificent steel arch soars into the sky over the majestic Purple Mountain and the vast Yangtze River—Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

The Yangtze River, which has long been regarded as an insurmountable barrier, has once again been conquered by the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

This is a magnificent achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Determined to Take the Road of Self-Reliance

Nanjing is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Here, the river is wide and the waters are deep and turbulent. In the past, trains had to rely on ferries to cross the river. For generations, the people of Nanjing have dreamed of building a bridge here. However, under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and the reactionary Kuomintang, the ideal of building the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge for the broad masses of the people was completely unrealizable.

"Winds and rains rise over the Purple Mountain, a million heroes cross the great river." Under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have stood up! The tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction, like the surging waters of the Yangtze River, has risen higher and higher. The Chinese working class, with the heroic spirit of "daring to change the heavens and the earth," has successively built bridges across the Yangtze River in Wuhan and Chongqing's Baishatou, turning the barrier into a thoroughfare. With the development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our motherland, the Chinese working class, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "self-reliance," has issued a rousing vow: We must definitely build a more magnificent third Yangtze River Bridge in Nanjing!

"We will definitely achieve our goal." "We will definitely achieve our goal." Under the warm care of the Party Central Committee led by the great leader Chairman Mao, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge officially began construction amid cheers.

Workers from all over the country, full of spirit and high morale, gathered on both banks of the Yangtze River in Nanjing. The scene was one of great excitement: cranes stretched their long arms into the blue sky, iron barges and steamships loaded with construction materials sped across the river, their horns blaring. The workers proudly declared, "The reactionary rulers of old China and the imperialists of the United States and Japan once boasted that 'Nanjing cannot build a bridge.' 'Building a bridge in Nanjing is more difficult than climbing to the sky!' We, the working class, have mastered the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We can create any miracle in the world!"

The start of construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge shocked the world. Imperialism and modern revisionism were terrified and enraged by the rapid development of China's socialist construction. They did everything they could to impose an economic blockade on China, attempting to sabotage our bridge construction. When the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge entered the intensive construction phase, the Soviet modern revisionists maliciously slandered China's self-designed underwater foundation plan for the bridge, claiming that the heavy concrete caissons being sunk would break and that the underwater foundation design would definitely fail.

Chairman Mao taught us, "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the bitter end with our enemies, the resolve to restore what has been lost on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand tall among the nations of the world." Armed with the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers and revolutionary engineering technicians hated the provocations of the Soviet revisionists. They regarded the construction site as a battlefield against imperialism and revisionism, standing under the sky and on the river, declaring with revolutionary fervor:

"Standing by the Yangtze River, we have the world in our hearts!"

"Build the Nanjing Bridge quickly to anger the Soviet revisionists and the Americans!"

"Work hard to build the bridge, to make Chairman Mao proud, to make the Chinese working class proud!"

The workers and revolutionary technicians fully carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to forge ahead. They jointly analyzed and studied the sinking plan for the caissons, promptly summarized and promoted advanced experience, and overcame one technical difficulty after another, overcoming one obstacle after another. At a critical moment when they were just starting to pour concrete, a sudden heavy rain began. However, the workers' fighting spirit was not shaken in the slightest by the wind and rain. They shouted the battle cry, "Pour more concrete, bury the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists," and fought continuously, finally successfully sinking the caissons firmly into the riverbed, making the bridge piers stand like towering pillars in the river, declaring the complete failure of the Soviet revisionists' lies.

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us, "Imperialism and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle." The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, fearing that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built without a single foreigner, would stand tall in the East, betrayed their promises and played their last card: they tore up the steel material order contract for the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

The Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, and with great courage, resolutely fought back against the sabotage of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

The working class of the whole country took action. The broad masses of steelworkers in Anshan took on the task of trial-producing steel for the bridge. They regarded the smelting of special steel materials for the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge as a struggle against imperialism and revisionism, as a sacred duty to bring glory to the motherland and to the Chinese working class. The revolutionary workers, with their hearts full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, smelted the special steel materials in the face of the absence of technical data and experience, enduring temperatures of over a thousand degrees, and after repeated trials, finally overcame numerous difficulties and completed the trial production task quickly and well, ensuring the steel needed for the bridge. The working class of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and other places also made contributions to the construction of the bridge.

The various anti-China actions of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries could not stop the historical wheel of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction from rolling forward. The majestic figure of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built entirely by the Chinese working class through self-reliance, is a brilliant reflection of the great spirit of the Chinese people in opposing imperialism and revisionism and striving for self-reliance.

Two Lines in Struggle

Flipping through the history of the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, the life-and-death struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads is revealed page by page.

What kind of bridge should be built on the Yangtze River in Nanjing? What should be relied upon to build China's largest bridge? This was a sharp struggle.

The working class wanted to build the bridge according to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, using the proletarian worldview to change the world; while China's Khrushchev and his agents wanted to build the bridge according to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, using the bourgeois worldview to change the world.

Even when the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was just being planned, China's Khrushchev's agents held a so-called technical cooperation meeting, inviting a large number of "experts" and "professors" to design the construction plan for the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge behind closed doors. They hung hundreds of various drawings in the meeting room, all copied from foreign countries. The workers and revolutionary technicians participating in the meeting immediately pointed out sharply: "These foreign gadgets that are detached from reality are completely unworkable!"

The workers firmly declared, "We can only build the bridge according to Mao Zedong Thought, according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, starting from the actual situation in our country, relying on the broad masses."

The bridge-building workers, with Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Practice" as their guide, explored experience in practice and mastered the laws of conquering nature.

On the turbulent Yangtze River, the bridge-building workers drove the first giant pipe pile. The trial pile for exploring the construction rules of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge officially began. To formulate a correct underwater foundation plan, they used various methods to conduct experiments. The workers worked day and night on the river, carefully observing the situation and meticulously collecting data. The biting cold wind blew, the sharp wind like a knife, the water froze into ice, sometimes the gloves just touched the steel, immediately frozen to it, the workers used hot breath to open it and continued to work. The data gradually accumulated, the mysteries of hydrology and geology were one by one unveiled by the fearless bridge-building workers.

Chairman Mao taught us, "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress." The bridge-building workers followed Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly practicing, recognizing, practicing again, and recognizing again. They combined with revolutionary engineering technicians to build a bridge pier, summarize experience, and based on the different geological conditions in the river, propose various underwater foundation construction plans, and forge ahead a road of building bridges that is fast, good, and economical.

However, the walking capitalists and bourgeois technical "authorities" who usurped the leadership of bridge construction did not give up. They insisted on clinging to foreign frameworks in the construction process. The production process of prestressed beams is an example.

Prestressed beams are a type of reinforced concrete product that is needed in large quantities for bridge construction. Although China had already been able to produce them, prestressed beams of the high-quality type needed for the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge were still lacking in domestic manufacturing experience. The bourgeois technical "authorities" followed foreign doctrines, mechanically applying foreign data, spending tens of millions of yuan on a so-called "assembly line" for producing prestressed beams, insisting on dividing a single beam into three sections for production.

The workers participating in the trial production firmly opposed this. They said, "Foreign methods are wasteful of national resources, slow, mediocre, and costly; local methods are thrifty, fast, good, and economical!" Some workers questioned the bourgeois technical "authorities": "Why divide a single beam into three sections for production?" These people said, "According to foreign data, for the convenience of transportation." The workers said, "We produce and use locally, why divide the sections?" They asked those big shots to the point of speechlessness.

Just as those bourgeois technical "authorities" were busy building factories and setting up so-called "assembly lines," the bridge-building workers and revolutionary engineering technicians began to use local methods to trial-produce whole prestressed beams. On the bridge construction site, the struggle between two worldviews and two lines was sharp and clear.

The bridge-building workers, with their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, took the sky as their tent and the earth as their stage, enduring wind and rain, day and night fighting on the construction site. In the scorching summer, they sweated as they worked; in the bitter winter, they braved the cold. In nearly a year, the bridge-building workers and revolutionary engineering technicians, with unyielding revolutionary will, conducted dozens of projects and thousands of experiments, learning from failures and summarizing experience, finally accumulating experience in the whole production of large prestressed beams, and exploring a complete set of new processes.

People celebrated the day the large prestressed beams were born, which was the day the so-called "assembly line" of the bourgeois technical "authorities" was bankrupt. The lonely foreign factory building became a mockery of the bourgeois technical "authorities"!

The Working Class Can Create Everything

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force of world history." The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought broke through the numerous obstacles of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and bourgeois technical "authorities" throughout the entire bridge construction process, creating countless miracles that bourgeois mediocrities and right-wing conservatives could not even dream of!

Hu Baolin, a worker who had been a coolie since he was a child, had always insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles." Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts illuminated this old worker's heart, giving him boundless fighting strength. When he heard that divers were needed to enter the very deep riverbed to check the foundation of the bridge piers and clear broken rocks, he volunteered to break through the deep diving barrier.

In the past, both Chinese and foreign records stated that divers could only dive to a depth of thirty or forty meters with ordinary equipment. This was the "danger line" for divers. The bourgeois technical "authorities" cited so-called "data," saying in a mysterious way, "Every ten meters down is one atmosphere, exceeding thirty or forty meters will result in dozens or hundreds of tons of pressure, and the person will be crushed into a meat pie!"

However, "dead data" did not scare away divers like Hu Baolin, who had high proletarian consciousness and rich practical experience. No matter how deep the underwater foundation of the Yangtze River Bridge was, it had to be investigated thoroughly. This is a matter of great importance for the Yangtze River Bridge for a hundred years! The members of the diving team said resolutely, "The road is forged ahead! The proletariat must forge a path that no one has ever walked before!" Hu Baolin stood up and said, "I will try! For the early completion of our own Yangtze River Bridge, I am willing to die a thousand times!"

Under the care of the Party and the strong support of all sides, Hu Baolin led the way into the water. Twenty meters, thirty meters, forty meters... Hu Baolin finally broke through the "danger line." The deeper he went, the stronger his fighting spirit and the greater his confidence. The cold winter river water was bone-chilling. Hu Baolin shivered so hard that his teeth chattered, but he thought of Chairman Mao's teaching, "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and fearlessly continued to operate in the deep water.

After many practices, Hu Baolin and his comrades finally accumulated rich experience in deep diving, making outstanding contributions to the diving industry of our motherland.

On the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge construction site, there were countless proletarian heroes like Hu Baolin!

The underwater foundation construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge reached a critical stage. The giant steel caissons, nine stories high, set up for the bridge piers, were floating in the water very deeply. Suddenly, the autumn flood of the Yangtze River surged, and a six or seven-level strong wind blew across the river surface. The anchor chains of the caissons, which had been impacted by the summer floods, broke under the attack of the huge waves. The floating caissons, larger than a basketball court, swayed violently in the waves with an amplitude of more than fifty meters.

If the caissons were overturned by the flood, the river would add a more dangerous reef than a giant rock, and the entire bridge project would be in vain. Some bourgeois technical "authorities" were terrified, fearing that they would be disgraced forever. They ignored the interests of the state, hid in the room, and came up with a plan to "let the caissons float downstream," advocating letting the flood wash the caissons away.

The bridge-building workers heard this and were so angry that their lungs almost burst. They indignantly said:

"Losing the caissons is a crime against the people. Losing the caissons is a slap in the face of the working class!"

"We must not let the flood wash away the caissons!"

The entire construction site, revolutionary workers, cadres, engineering technicians, and family members of the staff, all fought fiercely to save the caissons. "As long as I am here, the caissons are here!" The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought can fill the sea and move mountains, overcoming any difficulty. The anchor workers threw away the old frameworks of "cannot anchor in the wind," "cannot anchor in the rain," and "cannot anchor at night," regardless of the storms above level seven, torrential rain, and pitch-black nights, insisting on anchoring and positioning the swaying caissons. The wind was strong and the waves were high, the flood brought a large number of floating objects from upstream to the anchor chains around the caissons, the anchor chains swayed violently with the caissons, and there was a danger of breaking at any time. The workers quickly took off their clothes, tied ropes, and risked being swept away by the flood at any moment, sliding down one by one from the anchor chains to clear the obstacles.

The fierce wind pushed the surging waves towards the caissons, raising white waves several meters high. Suddenly, the underwater power cable supplying electricity to the caissons was twisted and broken. Once the power supply stopped, all work had to stop. The comrades of the second electrician class on the north bank immediately stepped forward, requesting to go by boat to repair the damage. Yang Weidong and his comrades, with sailors, rowed a small boat into the great river, fighting fiercely with the wind and waves. The wind howled, and the waves were like mountains. The construction workers loudly read the quotations from Chairman Mao, crossing the rapids, breaking through the giant waves, and rushing onto the power distribution room, restoring the power supply and ensuring the electricity supply.

After more than forty days and nights of fierce battles on the water, they finally overcame the autumn flood and stopped the swaying of the caissons. The workers, with their earth-shaking heroic spirit, composed another song of triumph for Mao Zedong Thought!

The Revolutionary Storm Opens a New Era

In 1966, the stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution swept through the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge construction site. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the heroic bridge-building workers held high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," driving out those capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" who had been entrenched in the leadership positions of bridge construction, and seizing back the leadership of revolution and production. The bridge-building workers held high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents. Slavery, crawling, foreign frameworks, old doctrines, all were trampled underfoot by the workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary and productive enthusiasm of the workers surged like a spring tide, breaking out!

However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves." China's Khrushchev and his agents were unwilling to accept their destruction, crazily pushing the bourgeois reactionary line, inciting the masses to fight the masses, spreading the counter-revolutionary wind of economism and anarchism, attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

However, the historical wheel rolling forward is unstoppable by any force. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with the direct care of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the bridge-building workers, with class struggle as the key link, vigorously grasped the revolution and promoted production, thoroughly smashing the evil plots of China's Khrushchev and his agents, and winning the victory of the bridge steel beam closure.

May 8th of this year is a day that the bridge construction workers will never forget. On this day, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received the representatives of the National Railway and Transportation Conference. The workers' representatives of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge were fortunate to see the supreme commander of the working class, Chairman Mao, whom they had longed for day and night! The good news reached the bridge, and the construction site was in a frenzy of joy. How many workers shed tears of happiness, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" echoed across both banks of the Yangtze River. At the rally to promote revolution and production, the bridge construction workers decided to advance the railway bridge opening time by three months to report the good news to Chairman Mao! To celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

Chairman Mao's warm reception and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "The working class must lead everything" became the greatest motivation for the bridge construction workers to ensure the opening of the bridge on National Day. The entire bridge construction site presented a vigorous scene of promoting revolution and production, with production rising sharply. The water pipe installation team of the north bank machine repair factory completed the water pipe installation task three months ahead of schedule; the efficiency of the south bank first team in laying the bridge deck increased by more than four times; the production of concrete beams by the workers of the north bank base team also doubled. The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Company, excellent construction workers from various places in Jiangsu, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army bravely shouldered the heavy task of building the bridgehead. They worked together, day and night, and fought hard for more than twenty days to complete the construction task that was originally scheduled to take nine and a half months.

On the eve of the railway bridge opening, on both sides of the main bridge in the river, there were ten radiant characters, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao," each character eight meters square, weighing about five tons. The workers of the fitting workshop accepted the task of making the slogan board, feeling extremely honored, and said with deep emotion, "The ten radiant characters of 'Long live the great leader Chairman Mao' condense the profound class feelings of our working class for Chairman Mao. We must complete this glorious task before the opening!" The ten radiant characters of "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao" were hoisted high in the sky above the bridge. The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the entire bridge. The bridge-building workers were extremely moved and said, "These ten golden characters most concentratedly express the feelings of our working class. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was built under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. All the victories achieved by our great Chinese people are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought! They are the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

    毛泽东思想武装的工人阶级的壮丽凯歌
    ——记我国工人自力更生建设南京长江大桥的英雄事迹
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年的光辉节日里，巍巍紫金山麓，浩浩扬子江上，凌空飞起了一座钢铁的长虹——南京长江大桥。
    长江，这条自古以来被人们喻为不可逾越的天堑，又一次被用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级征服了！
    这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    这是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果！
    坚决走自力更生的路
    南京，地处长江下游。这里江面宽阔，水深浪大，过去火车要靠轮渡过江。多少年来，南京人民就渴望着在这里架起一座大桥。但是，在帝国主义、封建主义和国民党反动派统治的旧中国，广大人民修建南京长江大桥的理想，根本不可能实现。
    “钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。”在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，中国人民站起来了！社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高潮，象欢腾的扬子江水，一浪高过一浪。我国工人阶级以“敢教日月换新天”的英雄气概，相继在长江上修建了武汉大桥和重庆白沙沱大桥，天堑从此变通途。随着祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设日益发展的需要，我国工人阶级在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，遵照毛主席“自力更生”的伟大教导，发出了气壮山河的誓言：一定要在南京修建起祖国更加雄伟的第三座长江大桥！
    “我们的目的一定要达到。”“我们的目的一定能够达到。”在以伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央的亲切关怀下，南京长江大桥在一片欢呼声中正式动工了。
    来自祖国各地的建桥工人，意气风发，斗志昂扬。南京长江两岸一片沸腾：起重机的长臂划破蓝空，满载着建桥物资的铁驳、火轮，在江面上鸣笛飞驶。工人们豪迈地说，旧中国的反动统治者和美、日帝国主义，曾经胡说什么“南京不能修桥。”“在南京修桥，比登天还难！”我们工人阶级掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹也能创造出来！
    南京长江大桥的开工震动中外。帝国主义、现代修正主义对我国社会主义建设事业的飞速发展怕得要死，恨得要命。他们千方百计对我国进行经济封锁，妄图破坏我们的大桥建设。在南京长江大桥进入紧张施工的阶段，苏联现代修正主义者恶毒诽谤我国自己设计的大桥水下基础方案，胡说什么我们正在施工的世界上少见的重型混凝土沉井下沉时会断裂，水下基础设计一定要失败。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”掌握了毛泽东思想锐利武器的工人和革命工程技术人员，对苏修的挑衅无比仇恨，他们把建桥工地当作反帝反修的战场，头顶青天，脚踩大江，一个个发出了充满无产阶级革命激情的豪言壮语：
    “站在长江边，胸怀全世界！”
    “早日建成南京桥，气死苏修美国佬！”
    “加劲施工，为毛主席争气，为中国工人阶级争光！”
    建桥工人和革命技术人员充分发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，共同分析研究沉井的下沉方案，及时地总结推广先进经验，攻破了一个又一个的技术难关，克服了一个又一个的困难。在一次刚开盘灌注混凝土的关键时刻，突然下起大雨。但是，大风大雨丝毫动摇不了工人们的战斗意志。他们高喊“多打一方混凝土，埋葬美帝和苏修”的战斗口号，连续奋战，终于成功地把沉井牢牢地扎在江底，使桥墩象一座雄伟的擎天柱矗立江心，宣告了苏修谰言的彻底破产。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”苏修叛徒集团害怕没有半个洋人参加修建的南京长江大桥屹立于世界的东方，就背信弃义，使出了最后一着：撕毁了南京长江大桥的钢材订货合同。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，以大无畏的英雄气概，坚决地回击了美帝、苏修的破坏。
    全国的工人阶级行动起来了。鞍钢广大钢铁工人，承担了试制桥梁用钢的任务。他们把冶炼南京长江大桥用的特种钢材，看做是反帝反修的斗争，看做是为祖国争光，为中国工人阶级争气的神圣义务。革命工人们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，在一无技术资料，二无经验的情况下，冒着上千度的炽烈高温，精心冶炼。经过反复试验，终于闯过了重重难关，又快又好地完成了试制任务，保证了大桥用钢的需要。北京、上海、天津、河北、湖北、辽宁、江苏等地的工人阶级，都为大桥的建设作出了贡献。
    帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派种种反华行径，阻挡不了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的历史车轮滚滚向前。这座中国工人阶级完全靠自力更生建设的南京长江大桥的巍峨雄姿，就是中国人民反帝反修、自力更生伟大气魄的光辉写照。
    两条路线的大搏斗
    翻开南京长江大桥建桥的历史，惊心动魄的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死搏斗，一页页地展现在人们面前。
    在南京长江上建设一座什么样的桥？依靠什么来修建我国最大的桥梁？这是一场尖锐的斗争。
    工人阶级要按照战无不胜的毛泽东思想建桥，用无产阶级世界观改造世界；而中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人却要按照反革命修正主义路线建桥，用资产阶级世界观改造世界。
    还在南京长江大桥开始筹建的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人就开了一个所谓技术协作会议，找来了一大批“专家”、“教授”，关门设计南京长江大桥建设方案。他们在会议厅内挂满了上百张各式各样的图样，全是从外国抄袭来的。参加会议的工人和革命技术人员当时就尖锐地指出：你们这些脱离实际的洋玩意儿，根本行不通！
    工人们坚定地表示：“我们只能按照毛泽东思想、按照毛主席的革命路线，从我国的实际情况出发，依靠广大群众来建桥。”
    建桥工人以毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》作指路明灯，在实践中摸索经验，掌握征服大自然的规律。
    波浪翻滚的长江上，建桥工人打下了第一根巨型管柱。摸索南京长江大桥建桥规律的试验墩正式开工了。为了制定正确的水下基础方案，他们采用了各种方法进行试验。工人们日夜苦战在江面，认真观察情况，细心收集资料。凛冽的寒风扑来，风尖如刀，滴水成冰，有时手套刚碰上钢材，马上被冻在上面，工人们用热气呵开再干。数据逐渐积累起来了，水文、地质情况的奥秘，一个个被无畏的建桥工人揭开了。
    毛主席教导我们：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”建桥工人遵照毛主席的教导，不断地实践，认识，再实践，再认识。他们同革命的工程技术人员结合起来，造一个桥墩，总结一次经验，根据江中不同的地质情况，提出各种水下基础施工方案，闯出了一条多快好省的建桥道路。
    但是，窃踞大桥建设领导权的走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”并不认输，他们在施工过程中，依然死抱着洋框框不放。预应力梁的生产过程就是一例。
    预应力梁是建筑桥面大量需要的一种钢筋混凝土制品。过去，我国虽然已经能够生产，但是象南京长江大桥需要的这种质量要求很高的大型预应力梁，国内还缺乏制造经验。资产阶级技术“权威”依照洋教条，生搬硬套外国资料，花了几十万元，搞了一个所谓生产预应力梁的“流水线”，硬要把一片梁分三段制造。
    参加试制的工人们坚决反对。他们说：“洋法上马，浪费国家资财，少慢差费；土法试制，勤俭建国，多快好省！”有的工人质问资产阶级技术“权威”：“为什么要把一片梁分成三段制造？”这些家伙说：“根据外国资料，为了运输方便。”工人们说：“我们就地生产，就地使用，为什么还要分段制造？”把那些庞然大物问得张口结舌。
    正当那些资产阶级技术“权威”大兴土木，修建厂房，搞什么“流水线”的时候，建桥工人和革命的工程技术人员，开始土法上马，试制整片预应力梁。在大桥工地上，两种世界观、两条路线的斗争，针锋相对，壁垒分明。
    建桥工人怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，以蓝天为帐，大地为台，风餐露宿，日日夜夜战斗在工地上，炎夏烈日，他们挥汗操作；严寒腊月，他们迎风施工。在将近一年的时间里，建桥工人和革命的工程技术人员，以顽强不屈的革命毅力，进行了几十个项目、数千次试验，失败了找出教训，成功了总结经验，终于积累了整片制造大型预应力梁的经验，摸索出了一整套有关的新工艺。
    人们欢庆大型预应力梁诞生之日，就是资产阶级技术“权威”的所谓“流水线”破产之时。孤零零地被撇在一边的洋厂房，成了对资产阶级技术“权威”的无情讽刺！
    工人阶级能够创造一切
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级冲破了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”的重重阻挠，在整个建桥过程中，创造了无数为资产阶级庸人和右倾保守主义者梦想不到的奇迹！
    从小扛长工出身的潜水员胡宝玲，多年来一直坚持活学活用毛主席的“老三篇”。毛主席的光辉思想照亮了这位老工人的心，使他增添了无穷无尽的战斗力量。他听说需要潜水员潜入很深的江底，检查桥墩基础情况，清理破碎的岩石，就主动要求突破深潜水这一关。
    过去，中外资料记载，潜水员用普通设备只能下水三四十米深。这是潜水员的“警戒线”。资产阶级技术“权威”搬出所谓“数据”，玄乎其玄地说：“每下十米，就是一个大气压，一超过三四十米，就要有几十吨、上百吨的压力，会把人压成肉饼！”
    但是，“死数据”并没有把象胡宝玲这样一些有着高度无产阶级觉悟和丰富实践经验的潜水员吓倒。大桥水下基础再深，也一定要下去了解个究竟，这是长江大桥的百年大计！潜水工班的同志们斩钉截铁地说：“路是闯出来的，无产阶级就要闯出一条前人没有走过的道路！”胡宝玲站出来说：“我来试验！为了早日建成我们自己的长江大桥，粉身碎骨也心甘！”
    在党的关怀和各方面的大力协助下，胡宝玲带头下水了。二十米、三十米、四十米……胡宝玲终于突破了“警戒线”。下水越深，胡宝玲斗志更旺，信心更大。初冬的江水，冰凉彻骨。胡宝玲冷得牙直打颤，但他想起毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，毫不畏惧，仍然坚持在深水下操作。
    经过多少次实践，胡宝玲和他的战友们终于积累了深潜水的丰富经验，为祖国潜水事业作出了杰出的贡献。
    在南京长江大桥工地，类似胡宝玲这样的无产阶级的英雄，何止千百！
    南京长江大桥水下基础施工到了紧张关头。为建筑桥墩设置的八九层楼高的巨型钢沉井，正吃水很深地浮运在水中。突然，长江秋洪暴涨，江面刮起了六七级大风。经过夏季洪水冲击的沉井锚锭设备，在特大风浪的袭击下，有的锚绳崩断了。面积比篮球场还大的浮运沉井，以来回五十多米的幅度在激浪中剧烈地摆动着。
    如果沉井被洪水倾覆，江中将增添比巨石还可怕的暗礁，整个大桥工程就会前功尽弃。一些资产阶级技术“权威”吓破了胆，担心自己从此身败名裂。他们不顾国家的利益，躲在房子里，竟然想出了一个“放沉井下流”的方案，主张让洪水把沉井冲走。
    建桥工人一听，肺都气炸了。他们愤慨地说：
    “丢了沉井，就是对人民犯罪。丢了沉井，就是往工人阶级脸上抹黑！”
    “决不能让洪水把沉井冲走！”
    整个工地革命的工人、干部、工程技术人员、职工家属，都为保住沉井而投入了激烈的战斗。“人在沉井在！”用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，海可填，山可移，天大的困难也能克服。抛锚工人丢开了过去什么“风大不能抛锚”，“下雨不能抛锚”，“黑夜不能抛锚”的旧框框，不管七级以上的风暴，瓢泼大雨和漆黑的夜晚，坚持为摆动的沉井抛锚定位。风大浪急，洪水把上游大量的漂浮物冲到沉井周围的锚绳上，锚绳随着沉井的摆动，猛烈地跳动着，随时都有崩断的危险。工人们很快脱去上衣，系着绳子，冒着随时会被洪水卷走的危险，一个个从锚绳上滑下去，清除了障碍物。
    狂风推着汹涌的波涛，向沉井猛扑过来，激起数丈高的白浪。忽然，给沉井输送用电的水下电缆扭断了。供电一停，一切工作就得停顿。北岸第二电工班的同志们立即挺身而出，要求乘船前往抢修。杨卫东同志带着水手，摇着一条小划子，冲入大江，同风浪进行了激烈的搏斗。狂风呼啸，白浪如山。建筑工人们高声朗读着毛主席语录，穿过急流，冲破巨浪，冲上配电房，接通了电流，保证了供电。
    四十多个日日夜夜的水上激战，终于战胜了秋洪，止住了沉井的摆动。工人们用自己惊天动地的英雄气概，谱写了又一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌！
    革命风暴开新宇
    一九六六年，无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨，席卷了南京长江大桥工地。在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，英雄的建桥工人高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，把过去那些盘踞在大桥建设领导岗位的走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”一个个赶下了台，夺回了革命、生产的领导大权。建桥工人高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命修正主义路线。什么奴隶主义、爬行主义，什么洋框框，旧教条，统统被用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人群众踩在脚下。工人群众革命和生产的积极性，象澎湃的春潮，冲决出来了！
    然而，正如毛主席所指出的：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人不甘心自己的灭亡，疯狂地推行资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗群众，刮起反革命经济主义和无政府主义妖风，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏南京长江大桥的建设。
    但是，滚滚向前的历史车轮是任何力量也阻挡不住的。建桥工人在毛主席革命路线的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的直接关怀下，在人民解放军的帮助下，以阶级斗争为纲，狠抓革命，猛促生产，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的罪恶阴谋，赢得了大桥钢梁的胜利合龙。
    今年五月八日是大桥建设工人永远难忘的一天。这一天，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席接见了出席全国铁路、交通会议的全体代表，南京长江大桥的工人代表无限幸福地见到了日夜想念的工人阶级的最高统帅毛主席！喜讯传到大桥，工地一片欢腾，多少工人流下了幸福的热泪，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声响彻长江两岸。在抓革命促生产誓师大会上，大桥建设工人决心把铁路桥通车的时间提前三个月，向毛主席报喜！向中华人民共和国成立十九周年献礼！
    毛主席的亲切接见，毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示，成了建桥工人保证国庆通车的最大动力。整个大桥工地出现了抓革命促生产的朝气蓬勃的局面，生产直线上升。北岸机修厂水道工班提前三个月完成了水管安装任务；南岸一队架设桥面板的效率提高了四倍多；北岸基地队的工人制造混凝土梁产量也翻了两番。江苏省建筑公司、来自江苏各地的优秀建筑工人和人民解放军指战员，勇敢地挑起了建造桥头堡的重担。他们同心协力，夜以继日，艰苦奋战，只用二十多天就完成了原定九个半月才能完成的建筑任务。
    大桥铁路桥通车前夕，在江中正桥两侧要悬挂“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁”十个光芒四射的大字。每个字八米见方，约五吨重。修配厂的工人同志接受了制造标语牌的任务，感到无上光荣，他们满怀深情地说，“‘伟大的领袖毛主席万岁’这十个红光闪闪的大字，凝聚着我们工人阶级对毛主席的无比深厚的阶级感情。我们一定要在通车前完成这一光荣任务！”
    “伟大的领袖毛主席万岁”十个光芒四射的大字，在大桥上空高高升起来了。毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光，把整个大桥映得通红。建桥工人无限激动地说：“这十个金光闪闪的大字，最集中地表达了我们工人阶级的心意。南京长江大桥就是在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下建造起来的。我们伟大的中国人民所取得的一切胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！都是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！”
