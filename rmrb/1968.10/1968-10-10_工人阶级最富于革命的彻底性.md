The working class is rich in revolutionary thoroughness. Wang Ruixiang, a member of the Revolutionary Committee and a female machine operator at the Yonghong Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau.

Chinese Khrushchev, driven by his counter-revolutionary purposes, hates the working class from the bottom of his heart. He maliciously claims that the working class is "selfish" and "only cares about its own economic life." This is a slander against the working class, a denial of its revolutionary nature, and an attempt to create public opinion for his counter-revolutionary restoration.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class must transform the whole of society in the struggle against the class enemy and in the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform itself." In the long course of revolutionary struggle, we workers have eagerly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview. Following the teachings of Great Leader Chairman Mao, we constantly raise our political consciousness, gradually grow into the most revolutionary, most advanced, and most selfless leading class, and have made great contributions to the Chinese Revolution and the world revolution.

In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers have taken the lead, with the fearless revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his horse," rebelling against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, seizing back some of the Party and government powers they had usurped, and establishing revolutionary committees. After the proletarian revolutionary masses took power, we workers have united as one, closely rallying around Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, wholeheartedly implementing each of Chairman Mao's instructions, and closely following Chairman Mao's strategic deployments. Great Leader Chairman Mao calls on us to "grasp revolution and promote production." We follow the teachings of Great Leader Chairman Mao, daring to take the lead in everything, putting the public interest first in everything, and insisting on fighting on the front lines of "grasp revolution and promote production." Coal production has continuously set new records. A few class enemies, in order to sabotage Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution and promote production," attempted to cause accidents and damage the mine.

In the face of such a situation, the first thing we workers think of is not our personal safety, but to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line at the cost of our lives. The more the class enemies try to sabotage the revolution and production, the more we must, with ten thousand times and a hundred thousand times the enthusiasm and energy, firmly grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, thoroughly smashing the desperate struggles of a handful of class enemies at the end of their rope. We follow the teachings of Great Leader Chairman Mao: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." We have extensively and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy, exposing these few bad elements, criticizing and fighting them fiercely, exposing their ugly faces in broad daylight, striking down the enemy's arrogance, and raising the masses' awareness of class struggle.

At the same time, we have set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with everyone, regardless of gender, age, or worker's family members, participating in the study classes. We closely combine the new situation and trends of class struggle, study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, and further raise the coal miners' awareness of class struggle and line struggle. Everyone proudly says: "The class enemies' attempt to sabotage the grasp of revolution and promotion of production is like a mantis blocking a chariot, seeking self-destruction. We coal miners are devoted to Chairman Mao. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do. Chairman Mao calls on us to grasp revolution and promote production, so we must wholeheartedly revolutionize, produce more coal, and produce good coal. With hearts burning like fire and unruffled brows, we remain unshaken even if the heavens fall and the earth splits." These few words fully express the coal miners' loyalty to Chairman Mao, show the coal miners' noble quality of putting the public interest first, and contain the coal miners' great ambition to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line fearlessly.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only the working class has the far-sightedness, selflessness, and thoroughness of revolution." "The working class should also constantly raise its political consciousness in the struggle." We workers will always follow Chairman Mao's words, insist on putting proletarian politics in command, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought every day, fiercely criticize the bourgeoisie, carry out revolution in the depths of our souls, climb the peak of selflessness, constantly raise our political consciousness in the struggle, and make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    工人阶级最富于革命的彻底性
    峰峰矿务局永红矿革委会委员、机电女工　王瑞香
    中国赫鲁晓夫从他反革命的目的出发，从心眼里恨透了我们工人阶级。他胡说什么：工人阶级“自私”，“只关心自己的经济生活”。这是污蔑工人阶级，否定工人阶级的革命性，为他反革命复辟制造舆论。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。”在长期的革命斗争中，我们工人阶级如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想改造世界观，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，不断提高自己的政治觉悟，逐步成长为一个最革命、最先进、最大公无私的领导阶级，为中国革命和世界革命作出了很大的贡献。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们工人阶级一马当先，以“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏革命精神，造了党内一小撮走资派的反，夺回了被他们窃取的一部分党政财文大权，成立了革命委员会。无产阶级革命派掌权后，我们工人阶级更是万众一心，紧紧团结在毛主席无产阶级司令部的周围，齐心落实毛主席的每一个指示，步步紧跟毛主席的战略部署。伟大领袖毛主席号召我们“抓革命，促生产”，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，处处“敢”字当头，事事“公”字领先，坚持战斗在“抓革命，促生产”第一线上，煤炭产量不断创新纪录。有几个阶级敌人为了破坏毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，妄图制造事故，破坏矿井。
    在这种情况面前，我们工人首先想到的不是个人的生命安危，而是要誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线。阶级敌人越是妄想破坏革命和生产，我们就越是要以一千倍一万倍的热情和干劲狠抓革命，猛促生产，彻底粉碎穷途末路的一小撮阶级敌人的垂死挣扎。我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，广泛深入地开展了革命大批判和对敌斗争，把这几个坏家伙揪了出来，进行狠批猛斗，把他们的丑恶嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下，打击了敌人的嚣张气焰，提高了群众的阶级斗争观念。
    与此同时，我们还办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，不分男女老幼、职工家属，人人都参加学习班学习，紧密结合阶级斗争的新形势，新动向，学习毛主席有关教导，进一步提高矿工们的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。大家豪迈地说：“阶级敌人妄图破坏抓革命促生产，不过是螳臂挡车，自取灭亡，我们煤矿工人一心向着毛主席，毛主席咋说咱咋干，毛主席号召我们抓革命促生产，我们就要一个心眼为革命，多采煤，采好煤，烈火烧心眉不皱，天崩地裂不动摇。”这短短的几句话，充分表达了煤矿工人对毛主席的耿耿忠心，显示了煤矿工人一心为公的崇高品质，饱含着煤矿工人为捍卫毛主席革命路线敢于赴汤蹈火的凌云壮志。
    毛主席教导我们：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我们工人阶级永远听毛主席的话，坚持突出无产阶级政治，天天活学活用毛泽东思想，狠狠批判资产阶级，在灵魂深处闹革命，攀登“公”字的高峰，在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
