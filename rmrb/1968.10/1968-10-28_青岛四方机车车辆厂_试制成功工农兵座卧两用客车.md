    Workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres at Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works have collaborated to successfully develop the "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Seat-Sleeper Combination Car." This is a significant project in the revolutionization of railway passenger car development. This seat-sleeper combination car is similar to the original hard-seat passenger cars, with each car accommodating 120 passengers. However, all passengers can sleep at night. The car features foldable tea tables that convert into beds at night, and additional upper berths that fold away under the luggage racks during the day. The original seats also solve some of the passengers' sleeping needs. Currently, this type of passenger car has been delivered to the Shanghai Railway Bureau for use, serving the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    During long-distance trials and improvements, this passenger car has received high praise from the broad masses of worker, peasant, and soldier passengers. An old worker said, "Only in the great era of Chairman Mao can we ride in passenger cars that are so thoughtfully designed for us."

    试制成功工农兵座卧两用客车
    青岛四方机车车辆工厂的工人和革命技术人员、革命干部三结合，试制成功了“工农兵座卧两用客车”。这是铁路客车试制工作革命化的一个重要项目。这种座卧两用客车跟原来的硬席客车一样，一辆能容纳一百二十位旅客，但所有旅客夜间都能睡下。客车上三摺迭式茶桌夜间放下就是睡铺，另加的上层睡铺白天摺迭放在行李架下，原有的座位也可以解决一部分旅客的睡眠问题。目前，这种客车已经交付上海铁路局使用，为广大工农兵服务。
    这种客车，在长途试运、改进中，得到了广大工农兵旅客的好评。有位老工人说：“只有在伟大的毛泽东时代，才能乘上为我们想得这样周到的客车。”
