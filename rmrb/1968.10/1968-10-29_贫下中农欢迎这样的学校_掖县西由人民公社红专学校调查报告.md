The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiyou People's Commune in Yantai County, Shandong, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on proletarian educational revolution, expanded the "Technical Night School" in Wangjia Village into a half-farm, half-study "Red-Specialized School" in 1958, enrolling children of the poor and lower-middle peasants from various production brigades to study. They selected two politically conscious young people with some cultural background and production experience from among the poor and lower-middle peasants to serve as full-time teachers. They invited brigade cadres, technicians, and technicians from the commune's technical station, veterinary station, tractor station, and mechanical repair factory to teach politics and technology. The brigade party branch secretary served as the school party branch secretary, strengthening leadership. The poor and lower-middle peasants were delighted to have such a new-type socialist school.

However, selecting students from farmers with practical experience and having poor and lower-middle peasants take to the lectern and hold power over the school struck at the heart of the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Therefore, over the past decade, a sharp struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads has been waged over whether to establish such a school.

Growing in the Storms of Class Struggle

In the autumn of 1960, a clique of capitalist roaders within the former provincial, prefectural, and county committees ordered the closure of this half-farm, half-study "Red-Specialized School." However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres firmly resisted this black wind. They said: "Our Red-Specialized School does not ask the state for money, does not eat state grain, solves the problems of teachers and school buildings by itself, cultivates personnel who are both red and specialized for the production brigades, and the poor and lower-middle peasants urgently need such a school. It cannot be closed!"

The school was not closed, but a clique of capitalist roaders attempted to turn the Red-Specialized School into a purely agricultural technical school, changing its name to "Agricultural Middle School" and pulling it onto the revisionist track. In the spring of 1961, a capitalist roader from the former county education bureau said, "Without changing the name, political leadership and economic support cannot be provided." However, the poor and lower-middle peasants said, "We would rather not use their support, but the school name cannot be changed!"

In 1964, after the Chinese Khrushchev peddled the "two systems of education" revisionist goods, a capitalist roader from the former provincial education department personally came here to peddle the revisionist goods of "business first, technology first," saying that this school was "too rustic and not up to standard," and that "such a school should emphasize the 'agricultural' aspect and learn more technology," etc., ordering it to move towards standardization and systematization. A clique of capitalist roaders within the former county committee, eagerly awaiting this, followed the orders and implemented a full set of revisionist measures: first, changing the school name to "Agricultural Technical School"; second, transferring a principal from a full-time middle school who only focused on business and not politics; third, sending college students to expand the teaching staff and removing part-time teachers. The number of full-time teachers increased from the original ten to thirteen, and two teachers of poor and lower-middle peasant origin were dismissed on the grounds of "inadequate ability" and replaced by a child of a landlord-class family; fourth, changing the student enrollment from the original brigade recommendation system to an examination system, recognizing scores but not class status, excluding children of poor and lower-middle peasants from enrollment; fifth, changing the curriculum from the original practical self-compiled teaching materials to learning unified "textbooks" and aligning with full-time schools. In teaching, they pursued the first place in scores. As a result, this school began to slide towards the edge of "big and comprehensive." The poor and lower-middle peasants and brigade cadres angrily said: In the past, when attending commune meetings, the Red-Specialized School was a stop, and we could chat with the teaching staff like family; now, we cannot sit together, cannot talk together, and have cut off ties with us poor and lower-middle peasants.

The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, roared with a cannon shot, and the Red Guards and poor and lower-middle peasants overthrew a clique of capitalist roaders and seized their power, thoroughly smashing the revisionist educational line. Especially after Chairman Mao's great directive to "in rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants" was issued, the poor and lower-middle peasants' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team took over the school and regained the power to manage the school. They closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and, together with revolutionary teachers and students, seriously carried out struggle, criticism, and transformation. Now, the name "Red-Specialized School" has been reborn, and the entire school has taken on a new look.

Cultivating a New Generation

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, the Xiyou Red-Specialized School has, over the past decade, cultivated more than 650 "socialist-conscious laborers with culture" for the countryside, distributed across all 29 production brigades in the entire commune. Among them, 75 have become active promoters of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, 56 have become brigade and team cadres, 55 have become machine operators, and many have taken on the tasks of agricultural technology guidance and livestock and veterinary work.

The youth cultivated by the Red-Specialized School have, for the most part, high political consciousness, do not forget class bitterness, do not lose the character of the working people, are not afraid of dirty or hard work, are both literate and skilled, and have played a significant role in the countryside's three great revolutionary movements. A graduate from the Dangdeng Brigade, upon returning to the brigade, took on the role of agricultural technician, was willing to get into the mud and water, shared weal and woe with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and built a socialist new countryside. This brigade had a piece of more than 50 mu of low-lying land that would turn into a frog pond after a heavy rain, yielding no grain. In 1964, he studied the "Three Articles" and proposed to the brigade to transform this low-lying land into terraced fields, planting rice in the ditches. Planting rice was a new thing here. With no experience, he observed and studied the rice day and night, leading the masses to strengthen management, and finally succeeded in the experiment, achieving a yield of 700 jin per mu. From then on, this low-lying land became a field of guaranteed high yield. During the cultural revolution, he engaged in a face-to-face struggle with a clique of class enemies. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised him as a "hero of production" and a "revolutionary pioneer."

The youth cultivated by the Red-Specialized School are loyal to Chairman Mao and the people, think what the poor and lower-middle peasants think, and are concerned about what the poor and lower-middle peasants are concerned about, wholeheartedly serving the people. This spring, the third production team of the Lüjia Brigade had a mare that was six months pregnant and suffered from "middle knot syndrome," which was ineffective after treatment by an old veterinarian. This matter was known to a veterinarian from the commune veterinary station who graduated from the Red-Specialized School. He decided to save the horse, pulled the horse to the commune veterinary station, carefully examined and analyzed it, and treated it with great care. As a result, only 1.2 yuan was spent, and both the mare and the foal were saved. His exemplary deeds are many. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised him as a "red veterinarian."

This school not only cultivated a batch of socialist-conscious red youth but also strived to conduct scientific experiments to serve agricultural production. Over the years, through scientific experiments, the school's 120 mu of grain fields set a high-yield example for the production brigade and provided many scientific and technological experiences. At the same time, it also cultivated 550,000 jin of excellent varieties, 1.6 million tree seedlings, and more than 2,100 large livestock for the production brigade, greatly promoting the development of agricultural production.

In addition, because the Red-Specialized School is self-reliant and practices thrift in learning, the tuition fees are self-sufficient, and the poor and lower-middle peasants can afford to send their children to school. Therefore, the Red-Specialized School is deeply welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants praise the Red-Specialized School as a "crucible for cultivating talents," a "base for scientific experiments," and a "consulting department for production."

Education Serves Proletarian Politics and Combines with Productive Labor

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." This school has been doing this for ten years according to Chairman Mao's series of instructions.

This school pays great attention to political and ideological education for students, emphasizing teaching people over teaching books. Political classes mainly involve studying Chairman Mao's works. Regularly, deeply impoverished poor and lower-middle peasants are invited to the school to conduct class education on recalling bitterness and tasting sweetness. They also often organize teachers and students to visit the poor, ask about hardships, participate in struggles against enemies, and raise the awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle among teachers and students, never forgetting class bitterness, and firmly remembering blood debts.

In teaching, they implement a combination of long and short terms, combining teaching with productive labor, and combining inside and outside the school.

Long and short terms combined. Long-term refers to long-term study classes. High school and junior high school graduates who have worked in the countryside for two or three years are selected by the production brigades and sent to the Red-Specialized School to study for three years before returning to the production brigades. Short-term refers to short-term study classes held according to the needs of the commune and brigades, such as agricultural technicians, livestock and veterinary personnel, accountants, and machine operators. Students bring problems to the Red-Specialized School to study for a few days or tens of days and then return to work. Over the past ten years, only the short-term training classes for livestock and veterinary personnel have been held for 14 sessions, training more than 560 people. Their combination of long and short terms has continuously strengthened the scientific and technological team of the entire commune, raised the scientific and technological level, and adapted to the needs of the great development of agriculture.

Combining teaching with productive labor. They established farms, forest farms, and large livestock breeding stations as bases, closely combining teaching with productive labor and scientific experiments. During busy farming seasons, they take vacations to participate in labor, and during non-busy seasons, they insist on three days of labor and three days of study per week, or one or two days of labor and four or five days of study per week. The advantages of this approach are mainly:

First, theory is combined with practice, learning is fast, understanding is deep, and what is learned can be used. For example, pruning fruit trees, the teacher lectures in the classroom, which is troublesome, and students do not easily understand. Lecturing and pruning in the orchard makes it clear. In the process of doing, further guidance is provided, leading students to flexibly apply theoretical principles to practice.

Second, it can mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of students and cultivate their spirit of creation. The eleven new wheat varieties cultivated by this school are the result of teachers and students breaking through from production practice and scientific experiments. They also summarized a set of high-yield cultivation measures, making the school farm's yield per mu 40% higher than the highest-yielding brigade in the entire commune.

Third, it is beneficial to reform the thoughts of teachers and students, making intellectuals labor-oriented. The students taught by this school can "get into the mud and water, do coarse and fine work, and be effective wherever they are placed," which is very different from students who graduated from schools with "three separations."

They also established fixed contacts with some surrounding brigades, often organizing teachers and students to participate in the labor and scientific experiments of the production brigades. They also closely cooperated with the commune agricultural technology station and participated in the rural technology exchange network activities. In this way, combining inside and outside the school, teachers and students are fully tempered, and the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants are timely listened to, improving and enriching the teaching content, better serving production. Originally, they lectured on planting sorghum according to the textbook: "When the willow flowers fall, farming is busy, sorghum is planted everywhere." The poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out: Here, we are by the sea, the land is cold, planting early will only rot the seeds, and sorghum should be planted before or after the Rainy Season. The opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants made this class more practical. During a labor session, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Yao Wang Brigade asked the teachers and students: "Why did this field die after applying chemical fertilizer?" The teachers and students, based on the problem raised by the poor and lower-middle peasants, tested the soil and found that the soil contained too much alkali, making it unsuitable for alkaline fertilizers. They suggested that this brigade increase the application of organic fertilizers and superphosphate, resulting in increased production. Based on this experience, they divided the land of the entire commune into plots and conducted soil testing, providing some good suggestions for soil improvement, which were widely valued by the commune and brigades.

Since its establishment, this school has carried on the spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, being self-reliant and thrifty in running the school, cultivating students' hard-working style. Over the past ten years, except for the state allocating them a portion of instruments, livestock, and building materials valued at 30,000 yuan, the teaching funds (including teachers' and students' living expenses and students' tuition fees in school) have basically been self-sufficient, and they have also accumulated funds (converted to goods) of more than 70,000 yuan for the state.

Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, the Xiyou Red-Specialized School has achieved certain results over the past ten years but has also been greatly interfered with by the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev. After the poor and lower-middle peasants' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team took over the school, they concentrated their efforts on implementing the series of latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao. They held many Mao Zedong Thought study classes, conducted in-depth class education for teachers and students, carried out revolutionary criticism, further eliminated the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, and raised the awareness of the two-line struggle among revolutionary teachers and students. They put forward opinions on educational revolution according to Chairman Mao's series of instructions on educational revolution, making the struggle, criticism, and transformation continuously deepen and develop.

    贫下中农欢迎这样的学校
    ——掖县西由人民公社红专学校调查报告
    山东掖县西由人民公社贫下中农在毛主席无产阶级教育革命光辉思想的指引下，一九五八年把王贾村“技术夜校”扩建成为一所半农半读的“红专学校”，吸收各生产大队贫下中农子女到校学习。他们从贫下中农中挑选了两名政治觉悟高、有一定文化水平和生产经验的青年担任专职教师，请生产队干部、技术员和公社技术站、兽医站、拖拉机站、机械修配厂的技术员兼任政治、技术教员，大队党支部书记担任学校支部书记，加强领导。贫下中农为自己有这样一所社会主义新型学校而感到高兴。
    但是，从有实践经验的农民中选拔学生，贫下中农登上讲台和掌握管理学校大权，正击中了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的要害。因此，十年来，围绕着办不办这样的学校，展开了一场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争。
    在阶级斗争风浪中成长
    一九六○年秋，旧省、地、县委内一小撮走资派下令要砍掉这所半农半读的“红专学校”。但是，广大贫下中农和革命干部坚决顶住了这股黑风。他们说：“我们的红专学校，一不向国家要钱，二不吃国家粮食，三自己解决师资、校舍问题，四为生产队培养又红又专的人才，五贫下中农迫切要求办这样的学校，不能砍掉！”
    学校没有砍掉，一小撮走资派又企图把红专学校变成单纯的农业技术学校，改名为“农业中学”，拉入修正主义轨道。一九六一年春天，旧县文教局走资派说什么“不改名，政治上不能领导，经济上不能扶持”。但是，贫下中农说：“咱宁肯不用他们扶持，校名也不能改！”
    一九六四年，中国赫鲁晓夫抛出了“两种教育制度”修正主义黑货后，省里旧教育部门一个走资派亲自出马到这里贩卖“业务挂帅，技术第一”的修正主义货色，胡说这个学校“土里土气的，不象个样子”，“这种学校要突出‘农’字，多学技术”，等等，指令要走上正规化、系统化。旧县委内一小撮走资派，对此久盼不得，遵旨奉行，大搞修正主义一套：一、校名改为“农业技术学校”；二、从全日制中学调来了校长，只抓业务，不抓政治；三、派来了大学生，扩大了教师队伍，去掉了兼职教员。专职教师由原来十名增加到十三名，并把两名贫下中农出身的教师以“能力差”为名排挤回家，换上了一名地富子弟担任教师；四、招收学生，由原来生产队保送制改为考试制，认分不认阶级，排斥了贫下中农子女入学；五、课程设置，由原来的结合实际自编讲义，改为学习统一规定的“教科书”，向全日制学校看齐。在教学上，追求分数第一。因而，使这个学校开始向“大洋全”边沿滑去。贫下中农和队干部气愤地说：过去到公社开会，红专学校是一站，和教职员拉拉谈谈，亲如一家；现在，坐不一起，说不一块，和咱贫下中农断了弦。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，红卫兵小将和贫下中农造了一小撮走资派的反，夺了他们的权，彻底冲垮了修正主义教育路线。特别是毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的伟大指示下达以后，贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队进驻了这个学校，重新掌起了管理学校的大权。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，和革命师生一起，认真进行斗、批、改。现在，“红专学校”这个名字得到了重生，整个学校面貌焕然一新。
    培养出一代新人
    西由红专学校，在毛主席无产阶级教育路线的指引下，十年来，为农村培养出六百五十多名“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，分布在全公社的二十九个生产大队。他们当中，有七十五名成为活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子，五十六名当了大、小队干部，五十五名当了机械手，不少人担负了农业技术指导和畜牧兽医工作。
    红专学校培养出来的青年，绝大多数政治觉悟高，不忘阶级苦，不失劳动人民的本色，干活不怕脏，不怕累，能文能武，在农村三大革命运动中发挥了很大作用。前邓大队有一个毕业生，回队后就担任了农业技术员，泥里水里都能下得去，和贫下中农同甘共苦，建设社会主义新农村。这个大队有一片五十多亩的涝洼地，一下大雨，就变成蛤蟆湾，颗粒不收。一九六四年，他学习了“老三篇”，向大队提出了建议，把这片涝洼地改造成了台田，沟里种上了水稻。种水稻，在这里是一件新事物。没有经验，他就白天黑夜守着水稻观察研究，带领群众加强管理，终于试验成功，获得亩产七百斤的好收成。从此，这片涝洼地变成保丰收的良田。在文化大革命中，他和一小撮阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争。贫下中农赞扬他是“生产上的好汉”，“革命的闯将”。
    红专学校培养出来的青年，忠于毛主席，忠于人民，想贫下中农所想，急贫下中农所急，全心全意地为人民服务。吕家大队第三生产队，今年春天有一匹怀胎六个月的马，患了“中结症”，经老兽医治疗无效。此事被一名红专学校毕业的公社兽医站兽医员知道了，他下决心抢救，便把马拉到公社兽医站，认真地进行检查分析，精心治疗，亲自护理。结果只花了一元二角钱，就治好了大马，也保住了小马。他的模范事迹很多。贫下中农称赞他是一个“红色兽医员”。
    这个学校不仅培养出一批有社会主义觉悟的一代红色新人，而且做到努力进行科学实验为农业生产服务。几年来，通过科学实验，学校的一百二十亩粮田为生产队树立了高产典范，并提供了许多科学技术经验。同时，还为生产队培育了优良品种五十五万斤，各种树苗一百六十万株，大牲畜配种二千一百多头，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。
    此外，由于红专学校自力更生，勤工俭学，教学经费作到自给，学生上学不用拿学费，贫下中农上得起。因此，红专学校深受贫下中农欢迎。贫下中农赞扬红专学校是“培养人才的熔炉”，“科学实验的基地”，“生产的参谋部”。
    教育为无产阶级政治服务同生产劳动相结合
    毛主席教导我们说：“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合。”这个学校十年来就是按照毛主席这一系列指示做的。
    这个学校很注意对学生进行政治思想教育，教人教书以教人为主。政治课，主要是学习毛主席著作。定期请苦大仇深的贫下中农入校进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育。还经常组织师生访贫问苦，参加对敌斗争，让师生在阶级斗争的大风大浪中提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇。
    在教学上，实行长短相结合，教学和生产劳动相结合，校内校外相结合。
    长短相结合。长，就是长期学习班。由生产队选送在农村劳动二、三年的高小、初中毕业的贫下中农子女，或中农子女，到红专学校学三年，再回到生产队去。短，就是根据社、队需要，举办农业技术员、畜牧兽医员、会计、机械手等短期学习班。学员带着问题，到红专学校学几天或几十天，学了回去就干。十年来，仅畜牧兽医短训班就开了十四期，训练了五百六十多人次。他们这种长短结合的作法，使全公社的科学技术队伍不断壮大，科学技术水平不断提高，适应了农业大发展的需要。
    教学和生产劳动相结合。他们办起了农场、林场和大牲畜配种站，以此为基地，使教学和生产劳动、科学实验紧密结合起来。农忙放假参加劳动，平时坚持每周三天劳动三天学习，农闲每周一两天劳动，四五天学习。这样作的好处主要是：
    第一，理论联系实际，学得快，理解得深，学了就会用。比如果树整型修剪，教师在课堂上讲，费事不小，学生还不容易听明白，到果园里边讲边剪就懂了。在干的过程中再加以指导，引导学生把理论原则灵活地运用到实际中去。
    第二，能发挥学生的主动性和积极性，培养他们的创造精神。这个学校所培育出来的十一个小麦新品种，就是师生从生产实践和科学实验中闯出来的。他们还总结出一整套高产栽培措施，使学校农场亩产量比全公社最高的生产队还高百分之四十。
    第三，有利于改造师生的思想，使知识分子劳动化。这个学校教出来的学生，“泥里水里下得去，粗活细活干得来，安在那里那里行”，和“三脱离”学校出来的学生大不一样。
    他们还同周围一些大队建立了固定的联系，经常组织师生参加生产队的劳动和科学实验。还和公社农技站密切配合，参加农村技术交流网活动。这样，校内校外结合，既使师生经受充分锻炼，又及时听取贫下中农的意见，改进和充实教学内容，更好地为生产服务。原来他们讲种高粱，照书本上说：“杨花落，农事忙，遍地种高粱”。贫下中农指出：咱这里是沿海，土地发冷，种早了光烂种，要“谷雨”前后种高粱。贫下中农的意见，使这一课更加实际了。在一次劳动中，腰王大队的贫下中农问教师和学生：“这片地为什么施上化肥光死苗？”师生们根据贫下中农提出的问题，把土壤进行了化验，原来是土壤含碱多，不适宜用碱性化肥，便建议这个大队增施土肥和过磷酸钙，结果增了产。根据这个经验，他们又把全公社的土地分片划方进行土壤测定，对土壤改良提出了一些很好的意见，受到社队普遍重视。
    这个学校从创建开始，就发扬了“抗大”精神，自力更生，勤俭办学，培养学生艰苦奋斗的作风。十年来，除国家拨给他们一部分仪器、种畜、建筑材料等折价三万元外，教学经费（包括教职员工资、学生学费、在校学生生活费）基本作到自给，而且还为国家积累资金（实物折价）七万余元。
    在毛主席无产阶级教育路线的光辉指引下，西由红专学校，十年来取得了一定成绩，但也一度受到了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的很大干扰。贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校以后，集中全力落实伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示。他们大办毛泽东思想学习班，对师生进行了深刻的阶级教育，开展了革命大批判，进一步肃清了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的流毒，提高了革命师生两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们按照毛主席教育革命的一系列指示，边破边立，提出教育革命意见，使斗、批、改不断深入发展。
