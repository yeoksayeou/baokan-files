The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai's 17th Cotton Mill is seriously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, mobilizing the worker masses to re-educate office staff with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Many work teams have sent politically and ideologically advanced and productive veteran workers to enthusiastically assist the office staff who have been sent down. The office staff have received a great education and have played an active role in the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 6th - The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai's 17th Cotton Mill has followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on re-educating intellectuals, mobilizing the worker masses to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate office and technical staff who have been sent down to the workshops and work teams. This has fully unleashed the active role of these office and technical staff in the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Shanghai's 17th Cotton Mill is a large cotton textile mill with over 8,000 employees. Over the past decade since liberation, due to the revisionist line of enterprise management pushed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the management structure of this mill has become bloated, with many management cadres and technical staff long detached from production practice and the worker masses. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the mill, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a revolutionary criticism of the revisionist enterprise management system. The vast majority of office staff have raised their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness through this revolutionary criticism. When the Revolutionary Committee implemented streamlining and efficiency, they actively expressed their willingness to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings and take the path of integrating with the workers. On this basis, the Revolutionary Committee organized a "three-in-one" Mao Zedong Thought study class, with office staff, workers, and Revolutionary Committee members participating. They organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on intellectuals integrating with workers and peasants and "taking the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among the workers." They also organized office staff to go to the worker masses to hold investigation meetings. The broad masses of workers used a large number of facts to expose and criticize the crimes of the revisionist enterprise management line of Liu Shaoqi, deeply educating the office staff. Everyone posted big-character posters and statements of resolve, expressing their determination to go to the worker masses, learn from the workers, and reform their worldview.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Students from old schools, most or a large majority of them, can integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have made inventions and creations, but they need to be under the correct leadership, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." The revolutionary masses of this mill, following Chairman Mao's teachings, warmly welcomed the office staff sent down to the work teams. Some veteran workers said: "Our working class needs more intellectuals, not fewer. We hope you come down to study, work, and fight with us workers, thoroughly reform your worldview, and wholeheartedly serve the people." Many work teams sent politically and ideologically advanced and productive veteran workers to provide "one-on-one" assistance to the office staff, caring for them in terms of politics, ideology, production, and life. Some veteran workers in the work teams, despite being very busy, still often took time to teach the office staff labor skills. In a small team of the third spinning workshop, when a worker saw that an office staff member who came to their team was not adapted to physical labor and was unfamiliar with the operations, they switched the easier-to-operate machines to him, greatly educating this office staff member.

In the process of working and fighting with the workers in the workshops, the office staff often revealed their intellectual tendencies of only believing in themselves and not in others, and of thinking they are superior. The worker foremen, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to engage in great political struggles," would find them individually for heart-to-heart talks, patiently helping them raise their political consciousness and establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. An engineer, who had not been in the work team for long, had his intellectual arrogance resurface. When he saw workers using a local method for a technological innovation, he not only did not actively support it but also thought this local innovation had little effect. The worker foreman discovered this and had a heart-to-heart talk with him, explaining the significance of this innovation to actual operations. Under the patient help of the veteran worker, the engineer criticized his erroneous thought of seeking foreign and new things, humbly learned from the veteran worker, and actively participated in this innovation, quickly completing the innovation task with the workers.

The veteran workers also fully trust the office staff in production technology and pay attention to unleashing their role. Now, various workshops have established "three-in-one" small groups with workers as the main body and technical staff participating, making the mass technological innovation and technological revolution activities flourish. The entire mill is in full swing with struggle, criticism, and transformation. After the mill dispatched one-tenth of the workers to join the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the remaining employees bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, continuously improving production levels.

    上海第十七棉纺厂革委会认真贯彻毛主席指示
    发动工人群众对科室人员进行再教育
    许多班组都派了政治思想和生产都较好的老工人，对下放的科室人员进行热情帮助。科室人员受到很大教育，在斗批改中发挥了积极作用
    新华社上海六日电  上海第十七棉纺厂革委会遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的教导，发动工人群众，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想对下放到车间、班组的科室、技术人员进行再教育，充分发挥了这些科室、技术人员在斗、批、改中的积极作用。
    上海国棉十七厂是一个有八千多职工的大型棉纺织厂。解放十几年来，由于党内一小撮走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线，使这个厂管理机构庞大，人浮于事，许多管理干部和技术人员长期脱离生产实践，脱离工人群众。无产阶级文化大革命中，厂里的广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对修正主义的企业管理制度开展了革命的大批判。绝大多数科室人员在革命的大批判中提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。当厂革委会实行精兵简政时，他们积极表示要遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，走和工人相结合的道路。在这个基础上，厂革委会又举办了有科室人员、工人和革委会成员参加的“三结合”毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家反复学习毛主席关于知识分子必须同工农相结合以及“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”的教导，并且组织科室人员到工人群众中去开调查会。广大工人用大量的事实，揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义办企业路线的罪恶，使科室人员受到深刻的教育。大家纷纷贴出大字报和决心书，表示坚决到工人群众中去，拜工人为师，改造自己的世界观。
    毛主席教导我们说：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”这个厂的广大革命职工，遵照毛主席的教导，热烈欢迎科室人员下放到班组。有的老工人说：“我们工人阶级的知识分子不是多了，而是少了，我们希望你们下来和我们工人同学习，同劳动，同战斗，好好改造世界观，做到全心全意为人民服务。”许多班组派政治思想和生产都比较好的老工人对科室人员进行“一对一”的帮助，从政治思想上、生产上和生活上关心科室人员。有些班组的老工人尽管工作很忙，还经常抽时间教科室人员学会劳动本领。三纺工场一个小组的工人，看到来自己组里的一个科室人员，体力劳动不适应，操作又生疏，就把操作比较轻便的车子换给他，使这个科室人员受到很大教育。
    科室人员在车间和工人同劳动同战斗的过程中，知识分子的那种只相信自己不相信别人和高人一等的思想会经常流露出来，工人老师傅遵照毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的伟大教导，一发现就找他们个别谈心，耐心地帮助他们提高政治觉悟，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。有一个工程师，到班组工作没有多久，知识分子的架子又抬头了。当他看到工人在用土办法搞一项技术革新时，他不仅不积极支持，反而认为这项土革新作用不大。工人老师傅发现后，就找他谈心，向他讲清这项革新对实际操作的意义。这个工程师在老工人的耐心帮助下，批判了自己求洋求新的错误思想，虚心向老工人学习，积极投入这项革新，同工人一道，很快地完成了这项革新任务。
    老工人们在生产技术上也充分相信科室人员，注意发挥他们的作用。现在各工场纷纷建立了以工人为主体，吸收技术人员参加的三结合小组，使群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动蓬勃开展。全厂斗、批、改搞得热火朝天。全厂抽调了十分之一的工人参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队后，留下来的职工勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担，生产水平不断上升。
