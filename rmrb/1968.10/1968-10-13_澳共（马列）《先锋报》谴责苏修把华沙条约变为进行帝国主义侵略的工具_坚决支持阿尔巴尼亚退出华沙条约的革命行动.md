	The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) "Vanguard" Newspaper Condemns the Soviet Revisionists for Turning the Warsaw Pact into a Tool for Imperialist Aggression and Firmly Supports Albania's Revolutionary Action of Withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact

	New China News Agency, Melbourne, October 10th: The official newspaper of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), "Vanguard," published an article on the 10th, expressing firm support for the People's Republic of Albania's revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact.

	The article points out that the Soviet revisionist clique has turned the Warsaw Pact from a tool for defending socialism into a tool for the Soviet revisionists to carry out imperialist aggression. Therefore, the Albanian People's Assembly's announcement of the People's Republic of Albania's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact is a revolutionary action that "helps to expose the imperialist nature of the Soviet revisionist clique and the imperialist goals that the Soviet revisionist clique seeks to achieve through the Warsaw Pact."

	The article states that Albania is the center of European socialism. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Khrushchev not only worked hard to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union but also worked hard to restore capitalism in the Eastern European countries.

	The article further points out that the Albanian Party of Labour, led by the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, opposes all such actions.

	The article states: "The Albanian Party of Labour has resisted all the notorious tricks of Khrushchev's threats, inducements, intimidation, and interference in Albania's internal affairs. Khrushchev became even more furious. At the notorious 22nd Congress of the CPSU, he publicly denounced the Albanian Party of Labour. Subsequently, the Soviet revisionist clique severed diplomatic relations with Albania and further applied pressure. However, the Albanian people continue to hold high the banner of anti-revisionism and anti-imperialism."

	The article condemns the Soviet revisionist clique's evil plots to interfere in Albania. The article states that the Soviet revisionist clique has never given up its attacks on Albania. Now, it is gathering troops in Bulgaria and threatening Albania with direct intervention.

	It can be said for certain that the Albanian people will rise up as one and defeat the Soviet revisionist clique's plots.

    澳共（马列）《先锋报》谴责苏修把华沙条约变为进行帝国主义侵略的工具
    坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚退出华沙条约的革命行动
    新华社墨尔本十日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》十日发表文章，表示坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出华沙条约的革命行动。
    文章指出，苏修集团已经把华沙条约从保卫社会主义的工具变成了苏修进行帝国主义侵略的工具。因此，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会宣布阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出华沙条约的革命行动，“有助于揭露苏修集团的帝国主义本质和苏修集团利用华沙条约来达到的帝国主义目的”。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲社会主义的中心。苏共第二十次代表大会以后，赫鲁晓夫不仅竭力在苏联复辟资本主义，而且竭力在东欧各国复辟资本主义。
    文章接着指出，以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，反对所有这种行径。
    文章说：“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党抵制了赫鲁晓夫威逼、利诱、恫吓和干涉阿尔巴尼亚内政等种种臭名昭著的伎俩。赫鲁晓夫越发暴怒了。在臭名昭著的苏共第二十二次代表大会上，他公开谴责阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。接着，苏修集团断绝了同阿尔巴尼亚的外交关系，并进一步施加压力。但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民仍然高举反修和反帝的旗帜。”
    文章谴责苏修叛徒集团干涉阿尔巴尼亚的罪恶阴谋。文章说，苏修集团从来没有放弃对阿尔巴尼亚的进攻。现在它正在保加利亚集结军队，和以直接干涉来威胁阿尔巴尼亚。
    可以肯定，阿尔巴尼亚人民将象一个人一样奋起，击败苏修集团的阴谋。
