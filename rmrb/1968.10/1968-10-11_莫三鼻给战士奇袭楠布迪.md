One night in March, two infantry companies and one artillery company of the patriotic armed forces in the northern Delgadinho Province of Mozambique moved swiftly under the cover of darkness towards the Portuguese colonial military stronghold at Nambuti.

Nambuti was a key stronghold of the Portuguese colonial forces in Delgadinho Province. The local Mozambican farmers strongly demanded the elimination of these fascist wolves who had committed countless atrocities.

The Nambuti area is flat, and the Portuguese colonial forces had built several barracks. They had meticulously set up defensive fortifications around the stronghold: barbed wire fences, minefields, and hidden bunkers, believing this would ensure their safety.

With the help of local militia, the guerrilla fighters conducted thorough reconnaissance of the Nambuti stronghold. They stealthily infiltrated the area around the stronghold, gathering detailed information about the enemy's activities, the locations of their barracks and ammunition depots, and the distribution of their bunkers.

Around 4 a.m., the three companies of guerrilla fighters arrived at the designated positions near the Nambuti stronghold, hiding in their positions. The fighters lay in the grass, their hearts burning with anger, eyes fixed on the enemy stronghold, waiting for the signal to attack.

As dawn broke, the signal to attack was given. The young commander issued the order, and the mortars and recoilless rifles roared to life, their shells exploding within the enemy stronghold and defensive positions.

Under the cover of artillery fire, the two infantry companies launched a fierce assault from both flanks. The guerrilla fighters cleverly used the terrain to charge towards the enemy stronghold, carving out a path forward.

The enemy within the stronghold was caught off guard by the sudden attack. They were in chaos, firing wildly and blindly in an attempt to resist. But when they saw the guerrilla fighters charging into the stronghold, they dropped their weapons and fled in all directions. Some stepped on their own mines and were blown to pieces. Except for a small group that escaped, the rest of the enemy were either killed or surrendered. The battle lasted only an hour and ended in victory. When the guerrilla fighters returned to their base, they were warmly welcomed by the local farmers. An old man excitedly told the guerrilla fighters, "Children, you fought well! If you keep fighting like this, Mozambique will surely achieve liberation."

    莫三鼻给战士奇袭楠布迪
    三月的一个夜晚，莫三鼻给北部德尔加多角省某地爱国武装力量的两个步兵连和一个炮兵连的战士，在夜幕的掩护下，迅速地向葡萄牙殖民军楠布迪据点前进。
    楠布迪据点，是葡萄牙殖民军在德尔加多角省的一个重要巢穴。当地的莫三鼻给非洲农民强烈要求消灭这些血债累累的法西斯豺狼。
    楠布迪一带是平原，葡萄牙殖民军的据点有十几间营房。殖民军挖空心思，在据点周围布置了严密的防御设施：架设铁丝网，布置地雷区，修筑暗堡，以为这样就可以高枕无忧了。
    游击战士在当地民兵的帮助下，对楠布迪据点的情况作了反复的侦察。他们机警地潜入据点附近，把敌人的活动规律、敌军宿舍、弹药库位置以及暗堡的分布等情况都摸得清清楚楚。
    凌晨四时左右，这三个连的游击战士按预定计划到达楠布迪据点附近，隐蔽地进入阵地。游击战士们匐伏在草丛中，满腔怒火，盯住敌人的据点，等待着进攻时刻的到来。
    天刚破晓，进攻的时刻到来了。年青的指挥员一声令下，迫击炮、无后坐力炮顿时怒吼起来，炮弹在敌人据点和防御工事里爆炸了。
    在炮火掩护下，两个步兵连的游击战士从两翼发起了勇猛的冲锋。游击战士机灵地利用地形，直扑敌人据点，杀出一条前进的道路。
    据点里的敌人受到突如其来的袭击，乱作一团。他们晕头转向，盲目地乱放枪，企图抵抗。但当他们看到游击战士喊杀着冲进据点时，就扔下枪枝，四处逃命，有的踏响了自己埋的地雷，被炸死了。除一小股敌人漏网外，其余敌人不是被打死就是举手投降。战斗只经过一个小时就胜利结束了。当游击战士们胜利回到基地时，他们受到当地农民的热烈欢迎。一位老大爷激动地对游击战士们说：“孩子们，你们打得很好！你们照这样打下去，莫三鼻给一定能赢得解放。”
