Although we are more than 12,000 kilometers apart, our hearts are connected. We will always stand together, fight together, and win together.

Comrade Theodhosi, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the great victory achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is of historic significance.
