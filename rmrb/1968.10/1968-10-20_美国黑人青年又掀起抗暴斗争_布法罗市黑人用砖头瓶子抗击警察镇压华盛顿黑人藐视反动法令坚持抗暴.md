New York. October 19th. A new wave of anti-violence struggles by black youth has erupted in the United States.

On the 18th, large numbers of black youth in Buffalo, New York, participated in the funeral of a black teenager who was brutally murdered by white racists on October 4th. The reactionary ruling clique in the United States dispatched a large number of police to suppress the gathering, but the black youth fought back. They rained bricks and bottles down on the police and their vehicles, driving them into a state of chaos.

At the same time that black people in Buffalo were launching their anti-violence struggle, the anti-violence struggle of black people in the U.S. capital, Washington, D.C., continued. Despite the mayor of Washington, D.C., ordering strict enforcement of a law prohibiting young people from being out on the streets at night, and conducting mass arrests and using tear gas to suppress the black youth, by the evening of the 15th, many black youth in Washington, D.C., had been out on the streets for three consecutive nights and had fought with the police who interfered with their actions.

In addition, more than five thousand black middle school students in Chicago continued to boycott classes on the 15th to protest racial discrimination. Many black students also held demonstrations in front of the Board of Education and engaged in fierce struggles with the police who came to suppress them.

    新华社十九日讯　纽约消息：美国纽约州布法罗市十八日又爆发了一场黑人抗暴斗争。
    十八日，布法罗市的大批黑人青年参加了一名黑人少年的送葬仪式，这名黑人少年是于十月四日被美国白人种族主义者残酷杀害的。美国反动统治集团竟派出大批警察前去镇压，黑人青年奋起反抗，他们用砖头和瓶子，雨点般地向警察和警车砸去，打得警察狼狈不堪。
    在布法罗市黑人掀起抗暴斗争的同时，美国首都华盛顿市黑人的抗暴斗争仍在继续。尽管华盛顿市的市长下令严格实施晚上禁止青年人上街的法律，对黑人青年进行大规模的逮捕和使用催泪瓦斯进行镇压，但是到十五日晚上，华盛顿市的许多黑人青年已一连三晚上街并同干涉他们行动的警察进行搏斗。
    此外，芝加哥市的五千余名黑人中学生十五日继续罢课，反对种族歧视。许多黑人学生还在教育委员会前举行示威，并和前去镇压他们的警察进行了英勇的搏斗。
