	Good news rides the east wind,
	Crossing mountains and rivers;
	Chairman Mao's latest directive is issued,
	The news reaches the Revolutionary Committee.
	The old chairman, the military representative,
	Joy in their hearts, smiles on their brows;
	With loudspeakers and hammers in hand,
	They stride forward, one in front and one behind.

	As they walk, they talk,
	Their eyes welling with hot tears;
	Chairman Mao points out the path to light,
	This is our "excellent opportunity to learn anew."

	One says, the latest directive is a war drum,
	The war drum beats with divine might;
	We must uproot revisionism,
	And discard bureaucratism and pessimism into the trash heap.

	One says, the latest directive is spring rain,
	The spring rain nourishes the crops;
	New and old cadres should carry forward the revolutionary tradition,
	The revolutionary spirit is indomitable.

	One says, the latest directive is a bugle call,
	We, the working class, must follow closely;
	Sweat a few times, roll in some oil and mud,
	Persistence in labor is most precious.

	One says, the latest directive is a lighthouse,
	Shining over the five lakes and four seas;
	Illuminating the ten-thousand-li long march,
	Advancing victoriously, never looking back.

	As they walk and talk, they reach the workshop,
	The workshop is like a boiling pot of water;
	Red slogans hang on the walls,
	Eight-pound hammers swing in their hands.

	Cadres and masses sweat together,
	Everyone rushes forward;
	The factory presents a new scene,
	Revolutionary production takes flight.

    最新指示传到革委会
    学江
    喜讯乘着东风吹，
    越过千山和万水；
    毛主席最新指示发表了，
    消息传到革委会。
    老主任，军代表，
    喜在心头笑在眉；
    喇叭筒、铁锤手中拿，
    一前一后步如飞。
    一边走，一边谈，
    激动得双眼滚热泪；
    毛主席指出光明路，
    这是咱“重新学习的极好机会”。
    一个说，最新指示是战鼓，
    战鼓冬冬显神威；
    要把修正主义连根铲，
    要把官气暮气抛入垃圾堆。
    一个说，最新指示是春雨，
    春雨滋润禾苗肥；
    新老干部发扬革命好传统，
    革命斗志坚不可摧。
    一个说，最新指示是号角，
    咱们工人阶级要步步紧跟随；
    流几身汗水，滚一身油泥，
    坚持劳动最可贵。
    一个说，最新指示是灯塔，
    五湖四海放光辉；
    照亮万里长征路，
    乘胜前进头不回。
    边走边谈到车间，
    车间象一锅沸腾的水；
    大红的标语墙上挂，
    八镑的大锤手中挥。
    干部群众同洒汗，
    你也赶来我也追，
    厂里一片新气象，
    革命生产展翅飞。
