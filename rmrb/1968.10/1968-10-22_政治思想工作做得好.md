Workers in the casting steel workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant praise the workshop's revolutionary committee deputy head, Wan Zhuming, for his excellent political thought work.

The electrician group in the casting steel workshop was once known as a "dead corner." Some members of this group, influenced by anarchist ideas, had been passive and indifferent to their work. When the workshop's electrical equipment malfunctioned, workers would rush around in a sweat, asking the electrician group to fix it, but some in the electrician group would say, "Take it easy, no need to rush."

In August of this year, the proletarian revolutionary forces in the entire workshop responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and with high spirits, they strove to advance, making production flourish. However, the electrician group lagged behind, holding back the workshop's production.

At this critical moment, Wan Zhuming, a worker by origin and deputy head of the workshop's revolutionary committee, stepped forward. He went to this small group to "settle down," following Chairman Mao's teaching that "grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles." He carried out thorough and detailed political thought work in this group.

While working, living, and studying Chairman Mao's works together with the electrician group members, Wan Zhuming noticed that one worker often voluntarily went to the workshop to check the equipment. He immediately seized this opportunity to praise the worker in front of the group. Unexpectedly, this praise stirred up a storm: the praised worker was ridiculed and attacked by some in the group, saying he was "brown-nosing." Upon hearing these rumors, Wan Zhuming immediately convened a small group democratic life meeting. He led everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and guided them to discuss two questions: first, what kind of work attitude should be established? Second, was it right to praise the worker who voluntarily went to the workshop to check the equipment? Wan Zhuming also humbly stated: if he had praised wrongly, he would correct it immediately.

The meeting was very lively. Everyone, after studying Chairman Mao's teachings, had a clear understanding. Some said, "We proletarians must be clear-cut. The advanced should be praised, and the wrong should be criticized." Others said, "We should actively serve the workshop, go down to the workshop to check the equipment, and do the maintenance work in advance. This is the direction for the electrician group to face the workshop." In this way, the group members one by one spoke up. Those who originally ridiculed and attacked the praised worker, under everyone's enlightenment and help, also stood up voluntarily to admit their mistakes and expressed their willingness to learn from the advanced comrades. After the meeting, more and more workers voluntarily went down to the workshop to check the electrical equipment.

Wan Zhuming not only paid attention to doing thorough and detailed ideological work but also to setting an example, always taking on the heaviest tasks. Once, the electric furnace malfunctioned, requiring someone to go up to the high-temperature area of several hundred degrees to repair it. Wan Zhuming, without considering whether he could adapt to the conditions, was the first to climb up the electric furnace, inspiring the electrician group members. Some comrades said, "Old Wan is really tough. He has never been up to the high altitude, but for the people's interests, he dares to go up!" Others said, "The revolutionary committee members go deep into the production front line, working day and night with us, what bad things do we still have that we are unwilling to give up?" Some comrades deeply examined their past influence of anarchist ideas and decided to correct their mistakes and advance bravely along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

From then on, the electrician group underwent a great change. Everyone put studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought first. Every morning, before the day shift workers came to work, they would carry their tool bags and go to check the electrical equipment. As soon as they heard of a malfunction, they would rush to the scene to repair it.

    政治思想工作做得好
    上钢三厂铸钢车间的工人们提起车间里电工组的变化，都一致赞扬车间革委会副主任万竹明的政治思想工作做得好。
    电工组原来是铸钢车间有名的“死角落”。这个组有部分同志由于受无政府主义思潮的影响，曾经对工作消极应付。碰上车间电气设备发生故障，工人们跑得满头大汗，请电工组同志去修，电工组有的人却说：“慢慢来，不用心急嘛！”今年八月，全车间的无产阶级革命派响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，意气风发，力争上游，把生产搞得蒸蒸日上，而电工组却拖了铸钢车间生产的后腿。
    就在这时，工人出身的车间革委会副主任万竹明挺身而出，深入到这个小组去“落户”，按照毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，在这个组里展开了深入细致的政治思想工作。
    万竹明在同电工组工人一起劳动、一起生活、一起学习毛主席著作的过程中，发现有个工人经常主动到车间去检查设备，就立即抓住这一先进苗子，在组里及时进行表扬。谁知这一表扬却引起了一场风波：这个被表扬的同志受到组里部分人的讽刺打击，说他是“拍马屁”。万竹明听到这些流言蜚语，马上召开小组民主生活会，带领大家学习毛主席的有关教导，并引导大家讨论两个问题：一、应该树立什么样的劳动态度？二、表扬主动到车间去检查设备的同志对不对？万竹明还谦虚地表示：如果自己表扬错了，就向大家检查，立即改正。
    这个会开得很热烈。大家学习了毛主席的教导，心里都亮堂了。有的说：“我们工人阶级就是要旗帜鲜明，先进的就应该表扬，错误的就应该批评。”有的说：“我们应该主动为车间服务，下车间检查设备，事先做好检修工作，这是电工组面向车间的一个方向。”就这样，组员们一个一个谈开了。原来对被表扬的同志讽刺打击的人，在大家的启发和帮助下，也主动站起来承认错误，表示要向先进的同志学习。会后，主动下车间检查电气设备的同志不断增多。
    万竹明不仅注意做深入细致的思想工作，还注意身教，处处拣重担子挑。有一次，电炉发生故障，需要到几百度高温的上空去检修。万竹明不顾自己的身体适应不适应，第一个冲上电炉，带动了电工组的同志。有的同志感动地说：“老万真是过得硬。他从未上过高空，但他为了人民的利益，就是敢上！”有的说：“革委会同志深入生产第一线，夜以继日地和我们一起生产劳动，我们还有什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”有的同志沉痛地检查了过去所受的无政府主义思想影响，决心改正错误，沿着毛主席的革命路线奋勇前进。
    从此，电工组的面貌大变样了。大家都把活学活用毛泽东思想放在首位，每天早晨，个个都背起工具包，在早班工人还未上班前，就去检查电气设备。一听见那里发生故障，他们就立即奔赴现场进行抢修。
