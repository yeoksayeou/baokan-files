	Recently, on one day, American bandits conducted a "sweeping operation" in a county of Tuy Hoa Province. The enemy, relying on tanks and armored vehicles, ran amok everywhere, killing and burning. Four impoverished peasants living near Dong Xoai—Ah Zhan, Ah Wu, Ah Qing, and Ah Cheng—formed a combat squad, procured several landmines, and decided to fight the enemy to the end.

	As night fell, Ah Zhan and his comrades went to the outskirts of the enemy's armored vehicle base. They calmly dug the ground to bury the landmines, preparing to give the American bandits a taste of their own medicine when they returned to their base. After burying the landmines, they waited nearby. They waited for a long time but still did not see the enemy. They grew anxious and upon further inquiry, they found out that the American bandits had fled to the Ba Ria stronghold after suffering a defeat.

	Ba Ria is in another district. Ah Zhan and the other three said: "The land of Ba Ria is also part of our country, and the people of Ba Ria are also our flesh and blood. If the American bandits flee there, we will chase after them and fight!" The four immediately dug up the landmines and hurried to Ba Ria that very night. By 2 a.m., they finally found their target. Despite their fatigue and hunger, they buried the landmines.

	After burying the landmines, they quietly waited. Suddenly, they heard a rumbling sound. Ah Zhan excitedly shouted, "The cars are coming!" Indeed, a convoy of enemy vehicles was approaching. The moment they had been waiting for had arrived. A loud explosion! A vehicle of the enemy, which had trampled on the land of South Vietnam and slaughtered the people of South Vietnam, received its punishment. The American devils on the vehicle were blown up and burned to death. The other vehicles' enemies panicked and fled in disarray. Another loud explosion! The landmine that Ah Zhan and the others had buried 100 meters away also detonated, turning another enemy tank into scrap metal.

    南越农民追打美国强盗
    不久前的一天，美国强盗到土龙木省的一个县进行“扫荡”，敌人依仗着坦克和装甲车，到处横行霸道，杀人放火。住在同江附近的贫苦农民阿赞、阿悟、阿情和阿成四个人，组成了一个战斗小组，弄到几个地雷，决心同敌人战斗到底。
    当夜色降临时，阿赞和他的战友便到敌人装甲车驻地外面，从容不迫地挖土埋地雷，准备让美国强盗返回驻地时好好吃一顿“铁西瓜”。他们埋好地雷，就在附近等着。等了好久，还是看不到敌人。他们急了，再一打听，原来美国强盗因为吃了败仗，已逃到百竹据点去了。
    百竹是在另一个乡。阿赞他们四个人表示：百竹的土地同样是祖国的土地，百竹的人民同样是自己的骨肉同胞，美国强盗逃到那里，就追上去打！四个人立即挖起地雷，在当天晚上赶到百竹。到深夜两点钟，才找到目标。他们不顾劳累和饥饿埋下地雷。
    地雷埋好了，他们就静静地等着。突然，有隆隆的声音传来。阿赞高兴地叫起来：“车来了！”果然不错，一个敌人车队开过来了。他们等候已久的时候到来了。?！一声巨响，一辆践踏越南南方土地、残杀越南南方人民的敌人军车受到了惩罚，车上的美国鬼子也被炸死、烧死。其他车上的敌人惊慌失措，仓惶逃跑。?！又一声巨响，阿赞他们埋在一百米外的另一颗地雷也爆炸了，另一辆敌人的坦克也变成了废铁。
