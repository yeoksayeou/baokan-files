A Magnificent Battle
—Recounting the Glorious Deeds of the Revolutionary Masses and Local Troops in the Steel City and Liaoyang County in Rescuing Red Guards and Soldiers

Our great motherland, after more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has seen the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, and the spiritual revolution of the people has reached an unprecedented height. Recently, the revolutionary masses and local troops in the Steel City and Liaoyang County staged a heart-pounding and moving rescue operation in Xingshan, which is a triumphant song reflecting the great spirit of communism.

Following Chairman Mao, Always Loyal to Chairman Mao

In late June of this year, the students and teachers of the Worker-Peasant School of the Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, following Chairman Mao's great teaching that intellectuals must integrate with workers and peasants, went to the Blue Family Commune in Liaoyang for a political field training under the leadership of the school revolutionary committee and four soldiers from the Third Company of the Anshan Support Left Forces, including Deputy Squad Leader Wu Shaokuan. They took the poor and lower-middle peasants, the most reliable allies of the working class, as their teachers, criticized the revisionist educational line of Khrushchev, participated in production labor, and decided to advance bravely along the revolutionary course indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao!

On the morning of July 2, the young guards, as usual, stood before the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Then, they learned from the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, helping the masses to carry water and sweep the courtyard, achieving "full buckets and clean ground."

Suddenly, a student dropped a community member's bucket into the well!

"Strictly follow the 'Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention,' quickly go down the well to retrieve it!" The Red Guards rushed to the well. In the crowd, the deputy squad leader of the second class of the first year, Mao Xinping, took a quick step to the well and said, "I'll go!" He quickly tied the rope and went down the well.

The small bucket, in the eyes of the Red Guards, was so important!

Mao Xinping stood on the stones at the bottom of the well, close to the water surface, using a rake to retrieve the bucket. More than twenty minutes passed. The students above wanted to replace him, urging him to come up. Mao Xinping firmly said, "I must retrieve the bucket!"

This was a well over three zhangs deep, with water about three chi deep. Due to long-term neglect, the well walls were loose, and a whirlpool formed under the water.

Suddenly, the stone Mao Xinping was standing on fell into the whirlpool. Immediately, there was a "boom," and the lower part of the well wall collapsed. The people above quickly pulled the rope, but it was too late. The stones and soil had already buried our Red Guard Mao Xinping!

At this moment, Mao Xinping shouted from the bottom of the well:

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

This shout stirred the hearts of everyone above. This seventeen-year-old Red Guard, in the face of life-threatening danger, did not think of his father or mother, but only of Chairman Mao. His heartfelt shout of "Long live Chairman Mao!" expressed the Red Guards' loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary teachers and students present, and the poor and lower-middle peasants who rushed to the scene, immediately organized the rescue. Just as everyone was rushing to go down the well, a soldier ran over. Everyone saw it was Wu Shaokuan, and they quickly pulled him back. Wu Shaokuan anxiously said, "I am a Communist Party member, I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, rescuing the Red Guards is my duty, don't delay, rescue the Red Guards is the most important thing!" Before anyone could stop him, he jumped into the well. Everyone quickly tied two ropes to him and lowered him into the well.

Wu Shaokuan went down the well, and many stones on the well wall were already hanging. He was determined to rescue the Red Guard before the major collapse, using all his strength to dig through the stones. The falling stones hit him, but he replied with unwavering determination: "The stones can only smash my flesh, they cannot smash my resolute will to rescue the Red Guards! The stones can only break my bones, they cannot smash my loyalty to Chairman Mao's soul!"

In an instant, a thunderous roar echoed, and the entire well collapsed from bottom to top continuously!

"Wu Shaokuan! Mao Xinping! Mao Xinping! Wu Shaokuan!" The people cried out in tears, desperately rescuing them.

United under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought

"We are all from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. ... All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other."

The affectionate teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao are the highest command for everyone.

The Red Guards rushed to report the news; the nearby telephone exchange and switchboard called out the emergency to various places.

"Quickly rescue the Red Guards!"

"Quickly rescue our comrades in arms, the soldiers!"

The villagers of Xingshan and nearby villages, who were weeding, fertilizing, and weeding in the fields, dropped their tools, picked up shovels and picks, and rushed to the well.

Wu Shaokuan's Third Company immediately assembled; a motorized platoon from a certain unit of the Liaoyang garrison, which was conducting driving training, stopped the training; the soldiers rushed to the scene.

The news reached the Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the revolutionary committee was in a meeting. Director Mu Chunyang made a decisive decision, leading the revolutionary committee members and miners, boarding eight trucks, rushing to Xingshan like lightning.

On the roads leading to Xingshan, trucks loaded with rescue equipment from Anshan Iron and Steel Company workers, ambulances from various hospitals, were speeding.

A red line connects eight directions, and countless red hearts turn to the sun. Under the highest command of Mao Zedong Thought, batch after batch of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres from all directions, totaling more than 1,500 people, united under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a magnificent battle to rescue their class brothers. The rescue scene was teeming with people.

Leaders from various levels of revolutionary committees and commanders of the Anshan Support Left Forces formed the rescue command center. Deputy Commander of the Division, Song Naicheng, who arrived at the scene earlier, stood at the well mouth directing the battle.

The rescue site was narrow, and there were too many people to maneuver. Workers, villagers, and soldiers immediately formed three assault teams, one after another, into the four-foot-square well, frantically digging the well. The hooks were deformed, and the shovels were bent. Above the well, a triangular frame was set up for lifting stones and soil. The Red Guards, like shuttlecocks, passed basket after basket of stones and soil. Sweat soaked their clothes, and they did not know they were tired! Their hands were blistered, and they did not know they were in pain!

The poor and lower-middle peasants brought batch after batch of wooden poles, doors, nails, ropes, and iron wires... They said, "Whatever you need, we'll provide it!" The supply and marketing cooperative opened its warehouse, providing full support. The students ran back and forth, carrying tools.

An old poor peasant, Ma Qingchun, who lived by the well, saw that the rescuers were numerous, and his cucumber trellis was in the way, so he took it down. He said, "What's this garden worth? As long as we save the soldiers and Red Guards, even if we don't eat vegetables for five years, we'll be content!"

The well was dug deeper and deeper, and cracks appeared on the well walls. The rescue command decided to immediately support the well. Old workers rushed into the well. Support was urgently needed for wood. Participating in the rescue, poor peasant community member Wang Changjin heard this and immediately thought of the wood he had prepared for building a house at home. He said, "We have it at home!" and took the Red Guards home to carry it. The Red Guards counted the wood as they carried it. Wang Changjin eagerly said, "What time is this to count? Hurry up and carry it!" He finished and, with the Red Guards carrying the wood, rushed to the well mouth. On the rescue scene, how many people like Wang Changjin were there, who put the public interest first!

In the heart, only Chairman Mao, the will does not move under the pressure of Mount Tai

After the major collapse of the entire well, Wu Shaokuan was buried under more than two zhangs of stones and soil and fainted.

Wu Shaokuan, the son of a poor peasant who once begged for food with his mother, became an active learner and propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought after enlisting. On the "Three Supports, Two Militant" battlefield, he used the great Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, and was not afraid to use his life and blood to protect the people, earning the title of "Mao Zedong Thought propagandist, guard of Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, and servant of the people."

Wu Shaokuan woke up from his faint, finding himself pressed by stones and soil all over his body. Because the well wall stones collapsed from bottom to top, the huge stones were interlocked, and Wu Shaokuan could still breathe through the gaps in the stones. He and Mao Xinping, who was pressed at the bottom of the well, were more than six chi apart.

The first thought that came to Wu Shaokuan's mind was, "Chairman Mao's Red Guards have not been rescued yet!" This thought weighed heavier on his heart than the stones pressing on his body. He called out:

"Classmate! Classmate! What is your name?"

"I am Mao—Xin—ping." After a while, a weak voice came from below.

Wu Shaokuan's heart was stirred like the waves of the sea, surging and rolling. He knew that Mao Xinping's situation was more difficult than his own, so he used his hands to push the stones on his body and his head to push the stones on his head. His hands were broken, and his head was bleeding, but he still fought tenaciously. He hated not being able to push away all the surrounding stones at once and rescue Mao Xinping. He thought, "I am now facing the 'enemy,' a revolutionary soldier, a Communist Party member, who must not surrender to the enemy. I must continue to fight to rescue Chairman Mao's Red Guards!"

Wu Shaokuan, enduring the pain, loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Encouraging Mao Xinping.

Immediately, Mao Xinping also recited: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

After a while, Mao Xinping said, "Comrade, please convey to my parents that I have let down the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation of me."

Wu Shaokuan's heart was deeply moved. He overcame the difficulty of breathing and encouraged the Red Guard to continue the fight, reciting over and over again: "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage."

Mao Xinping immediately recited word for word: "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage."

Wu Shaokuan recited over and over again: "Persistence is victory!"

Mao Xinping recited word for word: "Persistence is victory!"

The two voices were very firm and full of strength.

At this moment, Wu Shaokuan and Mao Xinping felt that Chairman Mao's great teachings were particularly affectionate, particularly warm, and particularly powerful. They always used Mao Zedong Thought to guide every second of their lives and used Mao Zedong Thought to direct their tenacious struggle.

Soon, a voice came from below: "I want to see the sun!"

Wu Shaokuan heard this and was moved to the core. He said to Mao Xinping with boundless excitement, "We will definitely see the sun that is the reddest in our hearts, Chairman Mao!"

Two hearts, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, were tightly pressed together. These two comrades buried deep in the well, the heroes of our time, had only Chairman Mao in their hearts, and their will did not waver even under the pressure of Mount Tai. Wu Shaokuan and Mao Xinping used all their strength to shout in unison:

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

At this moment, the platoon leader of the Third Company, Wang Lizhen, a Communist Party member, who was rescuing in the well, had dug more than one zhang deep. He heard the most inspiring voice coming from the gaps in the stones and immediately shouted excitedly to the top, "Don't talk! Don't talk!" The entire scene fell silent. Only the voice from the bottom of the well was heard again: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

This voice broke through the soil layer, passed through the gaps in the stones, and reached the top. Immediately, the support frame erupted with the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao!" The entire scene erupted with the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao!"

From this moment on, people were afraid of injuring their class brothers and immediately threw away the shovels and picks in their hands, desperately digging the soil and fiercely digging the stones with their hands.

Suddenly, someone shouted, "Be careful, danger!" The well wall appeared with a large crack, and the falling stones poured down. A huge danger was threatening the people.

"Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and tigers."

Old worker Yan Desheng and the platoon leader of the Second Platoon of the Third Company, Communist Party member Cheng Zhihai, rushed into the well. The falling stones hit them, and they said, "If the well collapses, we two will each bear half of it!" A large stone was just above Wu Shaokuan's head, and they, with one breath, lifted the stone open.

Wu Shaokuan's head was exposed! Everyone's hearts flew into the well. A soldier sent down a military cap, a villager passed down a straw hat, and a worker handed down a safety helmet. Three hats, deep affection! Showing the great unity of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. "The unity of military and civilians is like one person, see who can defeat us?"

The danger became more serious again.

Behind Wu Shaokuan's head, several stones on the well wall had loosened and were about to collapse. Before one could say "go," the platoon leader of the Fourth Platoon of the Third Company, Communist Party member Li Zhiqian, suddenly pounced on Wu Shaokuan's head. He used his legs to firmly prop up a huge stone that was about to collapse and did not move. Wu Shaokuan shook his hands to take off the safety helmet on his head to give to Li Zhiqian, and Li Zhiqian quickly pressed down his hands, using his body to tightly protect Wu Shaokuan.

When Wu Shaokuan was rescued, it was already late afternoon, and it started to rain. People braved the rain and gathered around Wu Shaokuan lying on the stretcher. He said, "I have not completed my mission. Chairman Mao's Red Guards have not been rescued yet!" Everyone was moved and respectful, saying, "No! You have already done a good job. You have made new contributions to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" Everyone was concerned about his injuries, and he urgently said, "Don't worry about me, the Red Guards are still in the well!" People, with tears in their eyes, shouted, "Learn from the soldiers! Pay tribute to the soldiers!" Wu Shaokuan excitedly raised his hand and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The rescue scene immediately boiled over, and the shout of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed louder and louder. The news spread throughout the village, to the mining area, and to the steel city forty miles away. Everyone was shouting: The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has created a new heroic miracle!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts have nurtured how many heroes like Wu Shaokuan! In the battle to rescue the Red Guards with his life and blood, he was buried in the well for nine hours, with seven injuries all over his body. What power made him persist to the final victory? Heroic platoon leader Wu Shaokuan said, "In the nine hours in the well, I did not feel pain. It was Mao Zedong Thought that gave me the greatest strength; I was not hungry. It was Mao Zedong Thought that gave me spiritual food; I was not cold. It was Mao Zedong Thought that gave me the warmest sunlight. Thinking of Chairman Mao in my heart is victory!"

Putting the people's interests first

Platoon leader Wu Shaokuan had just been rescued, and the well wall collapsed again! People had just dug out more than two zhangs of stones and soil from the well with their hands, and now it was buried with several chi of stones and soil again.

In the sky, the thunder rumbled one after another, and the lightning flashed one after another. A torrential rain poured down. This collapse and heavy rain added greater difficulties to the rescue of Mao Xinping.

People rushed to the well mouth, opened the rain cover, and used their bodies to support the rain cover, not letting a single raindrop fall into the well. The rain was so heavy that people could not open their eyes or breathe, and the rainwater flowed down everyone's hair and back. Everyone did not move an inch.

In the rain, the soldiers of the Third Company recited Chairman Mao's quotations in unison and continued to fight by the well. This company, which had fought in many battles and won many victories, issued an iron will: "If the Red Guards are not rescued, we will not leave the battlefield!"

The rescue in the well urgently needed lighting. A worker, braving the thunder, lightning, and heavy rain, quickly climbed the power pole and connected the power. Immediately, a row of lights illuminated the entire scene brightly!

In the wind and rain, countless people braved the rain, stepped in the mud, and tightly pulled the thick ropes leading to the bottom of the well to transport stones and soil. The old workers on the support frame used their hands to hold the large baskets, layer by layer, sending them up, not letting a single stone fall and injure the class brothers in the well.

The leaders of the rescue, Deputy Secretary of the Anshan Revolutionary Committee Tian Zhenqing, Deputy Commander of the Anshan Support Left Forces Wang Lin, and Director of the Revolutionary Committee of the Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel Company Mu Chunyang, fought on the front line with the masses. When raincoats were brought, they gave them to the masses to wear; when food was brought, they gave it to the masses to eat.

The arduous battle continued until the next morning at five o'clock. When people dug the well to more than three zhangs deep, they saw Mao Xinping through the gaps in the stones. At this time, the well wall appeared with a crack more than one inch wide, and the falling stones fell one after another. The support frame was squeezed and creaked!

"At the critical moment, the members of the revolutionary committee should step forward and rush to the front line!" Mu Chunyang immediately organized a rescue assault team composed of revolutionary committee members. He stood in front of the assault team, leading everyone to hold up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," reciting the highest instructions: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it is thoroughly for the interests of the people."

"Develop the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)."

Mu Chunyang, this revolutionary good cadre who had once been a child worker, and everyone recited Chairman Mao's great teachings together, tears streaming down their faces, full of energy, as if Chairman Mao was by their side commanding the battle!

When the assault team was about to go down the well, the Red Guards who were delivering meals and water at the scene, holding two bowls of hot water, handed them to them: "It's cold in the well, drink some hot water before going down!" The assault team members could not hold back their excitement, taking big steps, rushing down the well.

The exemplary role of the revolutionary committee members inspired old worker Guo Hongjun. He was thin and had been stopped five times from going down the well. At this moment, he took three quick steps to the well mouth and was pulled back by someone: "You are not in good health, don't go down." This worker, who had been deeply oppressed and exploited by the old society, and the first to fight to the death with the capitalist roaders in the entire mining area, was anxious: "I have been handling stones in the mine for more than ten years, how can I not go down!" He shook his arm and went down the well. The stones on the well wall were all moving, and Guo Hongjun thought: "It doesn't matter if I, old Guo, die, but I can't hurt my class brothers!" He then told the comrades on the support frame: "If there is a collapse, you all go up quickly, don't worry about me!"

Mao Xinping's upper body was exposed. Guo Hongjun looked at him with boundless affection, deeply moved, hugging Mao Xinping, calling out: "Young guard! Young guard! Young guard!"

After twenty-five hours of fierce battle, people used their hands to dig to the bottom of this three-zhang-deep well that had been filled, finally rescuing Mao Xinping. Due to Mao Xinping being pressed at the bottom of the well for too long, the rescue was ineffective, and he sacrificed his young life gloriously. He wrote a magnificent poem with his short life, completely and thoroughly executing Chairman Mao's instructions.

He did not die. He will forever live in people's hearts!

The mother of the martyr, Xiao Yujing, said, "Child, you died for the people, dying for a just cause, dying gloriously. Mom will learn from you. Child, listen, Mom will recite the quotations from Chairman Mao that you taught me: 'You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!'" She recited several quotations from Chairman Mao in one breath and said, "Child, you did not finish the road, Mom will continue!"

The words of the heroic mother expressed the common wish of millions of people.

When the voice of "Long live Chairman Mao!" came from the well

The glorious deeds of the heroic platoon leader Wu Shaokuan, who was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, bravely rescuing the Red Guards, inspired people to move forward. This is the Red Guards visiting Wu Shaokuan in the hospital, singing with the hero: "Father and mother are not as close as Chairman Mao."

    一场气壮山河的战斗
    ——记钢都和辽阳县革命群众，当地驻军抢救红卫兵小将和亲人解放军的光辉事迹
    我们伟大的祖国，经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，毛泽东思想空前大普及，人的思想革命化达到了空前的高度。不久前，钢都和辽阳县革命群众、当地驻军在响山抢救红卫兵小将和解放军战士的一场惊心动魄的感人事迹，就是一曲反映人们共产主义精神大发扬的胜利凯歌。
    紧跟毛主席，永远忠于毛主席
    今年六月下旬，鞍钢樱桃园铁矿职工子弟学校革命师生，遵循毛主席关于知识分子必须与工农相结合的伟大教导，在校革委会和鞍山支左部队三连代理排长吴绍谦等四名同志率领下，到辽阳蓝家公社响山大队进行政治野营。他们拜工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农为老师，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，一起参加生产劳动，决心沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的革命航向奋勇前进！
    七月二日清晨，小将们和往常一样，披着灿烂的朝霞，站在伟大领袖毛主席像前，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！接着，他们学习解放军的光荣传统，帮助群众挑水、扫院子，做到“缸满地光”。
    忽然，一个同学把社员的水桶掉到井里去了！
    “坚决按照‘三大纪律，八项注意’办事，赶快下井打捞！”红卫兵小将们朝着井边跑去。人群中，一年级二班红卫兵副排长毛新平一个箭步窜到井前说：“我下！”他抢先拴上绳子下了井。
    小小的水桶，在红卫兵小将的眼里是多么重要啊！
    毛新平蹬在井壁下部紧贴水面的石头上，用耙子打捞水桶。二十多分钟过去了。井上的同学们要替换他，一个劲地催他上来。毛新平坚定地说：“我一定要把水桶捞上来！”
    这是一口三丈多深的百年古井，水深约有三尺，由于年久失修，井壁石头松动，水下形成旋塘。
    突然，毛新平脚下蹬着的石头掉到旋塘里去了。紧接着，“轰?”一声，井壁下部塌落。井上的人急忙往上拽绳子，但是已经来不及了，石头泥土把我们的红卫兵小将毛新平压在井下了！
    这时，毛新平从井底喊出了一声时代的最强音：
    “毛主席万岁！”
    这呼声，激动着井上每个人的心弦。这个年仅十七岁的红卫兵小将，在生命危急的关头，不想爹，不想娘，心中只有毛主席。他发自肺腑的“毛主席万岁！”的高呼声，表达了红卫兵对毛主席的赤胆忠心。
    在场的革命师生和闻讯跑来的贫下中农立即组织抢救，大家正在争着下井的时候，只见一个解放军同志飞奔而来，大家一看是吴排长，一把把他拉住。吴绍谦焦急地说：“我是共产党员，我是解放军，抢救红卫兵是我应尽的责任，不要耽误时间，救红卫兵要紧！”眼看他就要往井里跳，大家急忙给他拴上两条绳子放下了井。
    吴绍谦下到井里，井壁许多石头已经悬空了。他一心要抢在大塌方之前，把红卫兵小将救上来，拚着全身力气扒着石头。碎石砸在他身上，他用必胜的信心回答：“石头只能砸烂我的皮肉，砸不烂我抢救红卫兵的坚强决心！石头只能砸断我的筋骨，砸不烂我忠于毛主席的灵魂！”
    霎时间，闷雷般一阵轰响，全井从下到上连续不断地发生了大塌方。古老的深井一下子几乎填平了！
    “吴排长！毛新平！毛新平！吴排长！”人们流着眼泪大声地呼唤，奋力地抢救着。
    团结在毛泽东思想的旗帜下“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    伟大领袖毛主席的亲切教导就是对每一个人的最高命令。
    红卫兵小将们奔向四处报信；附近的电话局、交换台打电话向各处告急。
    “赶快抢救红卫兵小将！”
    “赶快抢救亲人解放军！”
    正在地里铲地、追肥、拔草的响山大队和附近几个大队的社员们，撂下农活，拿起锹镐飞快地向井沿跑去。
    吴绍谦所在的三连，立即紧急集合；正在进行驾驶训练的辽阳驻军某部的一个汽车分队，停止了训练；指战员们火速奔往现场。
    消息传到了鞍钢樱桃园铁矿，革委会正在开会，主任穆春阳当机立断，带领革委会成员和矿工们，分乘八辆汽车，风驰电掣般地奔向响山。
    在几条通往响山的公路上，一辆辆鞍钢工人乘坐的满载着抢救器材的汽车，各医院的救护车，正在飞驰。
    一条红线连八方，颗颗红心向太阳。在毛泽东思想最高指挥下，一批又一批从四面八方赶来的工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员、红卫兵小将和革命干部一千五百多人，团结在毛泽东思想旗帜下，展开了一场气壮山河的抢救阶级兄弟的战斗。抢救现场，人山人海。
    来自各级革命委员会的负责同志和鞍山支左部队指挥员组成了抢救指挥部。较早赶到现场的团参谋长宋乃成站在井口指挥战斗。
    抢救现场窄小，人多施展不开。工人、社员和战士立即组成了三个突击组，一组接一组下到四尺见方的井里，拚命地挖井。抓钩变了形，铁锹卷了刃。井口上面，搭起一个吊运石土的三角架。红卫兵小将们，穿梭似地传着一筐筐石头和泥土。汗水湿透衣服不知累！手上磨出血泡不知疼！
    贫下中农送来了一批又一批的木杆、门板、钉子、绳子、铁丝……。他们说：“要什么给什么！”供销社打开了仓库，全力支援。小学生们来回奔跑着运送工具。
    住在井边的老贫农马庆春，一看抢救的人多，自己的倭瓜架碍事，便把它拆掉了。他说：“咱这个园子算啥，只要把解放军和红卫兵救出来，就是五年不吃菜也心甘情愿！”
    井越挖越深，井壁出现了裂纹。抢救指挥部决定马上进行井下支撑，老工人抢先下到井里。支撑急需木料。参加抢救的贫农社员王长俭听说后，马上想到自己家准备盖房子用的木料。他说了一声：“咱家有！”便带着红卫兵小将回家去扛。红卫兵小将边扛木头边点数。王长俭急切地说：“这是啥时候，还点数？快扛！”说完，这个在农村两条道路激烈搏斗中，活学活用毛泽东思想，坚定地走社会主义康庄大道的贫农好后代，带着小将们扛着木头向井口飞奔。在抢救现场上，人们看到了多少象王长俭这样一心为公的人啊！
    心中只有毛主席，泰山压顶志不移
    吴绍谦在全井大塌方之后，埋在井下有两丈多深，昏迷了过去。
    吴绍谦，这个曾经跟着母亲要过饭的贫农的儿子，入伍后，成为活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子。在“三支”“两军”的战斗岗位上，他用伟大的毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，不惜用生命和鲜血保护人民群众，被人们称为“毛泽东思想宣传员，毛主席革命路线警卫员，人民勤务员”。
    吴绍谦从昏迷中醒来，发现自己全身被石头泥土挤压着。由于井壁石头是从下到上塌落下来的，巨石互相交错，吴绍谦还能从石头缝隙中呼吸到空气。他和压在井底下的毛新平相隔六尺多。
    吴绍谦醒来的第一个念头是：“毛主席的红卫兵还没有抢救上来！”这个念头，压在他的心上，比压在他身上的石头还要沉重。他连声呼唤：
    “同学！同学！你叫什么名字？”
    “我叫毛——新——平。”隔了一会，从下面传来毛新平吃力的声音。
    吴绍谦心中激动得犹如大海的波涛，滚滚翻腾。他深知毛新平的处境比自己更困难，便用双手去推身上的石头，用头去顶压在头部的石头，手推破了，头顶出了血，他仍然顽强地搏斗着。他恨不得一下子把周围的石头全部推开，把毛新平救出来。他想：“我现在正面临着‘劲敌’，一个革命战士，一个共产党员，绝不能在敌人面前屈服。我要为抢救毛主席的红卫兵继续战斗！”
    吴绍谦忍着疼痛高声朗诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”鼓励毛新平。
    立刻，毛新平也跟着朗诵起来：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    过了不久，毛新平说：“同志，请转告我的父母，我对不起党和毛主席对我的培养。”
    吴绍谦心里激动万分。他克服着呼吸的困难，鼓励红卫兵小将继续战斗，又一遍一遍地朗诵着：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    毛新平马上一字一字地复诵着：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    吴绍谦一遍一遍地朗诵着：“坚持下去就是胜利”！
    毛新平一字一字地复诵着：“坚持下去就是胜利”！
    两个人的声音非常坚定，充满力量。
    此时此刻，吴绍谦和毛新平感到毛主席的伟大教导，字字句句特别亲切、特别温暖、特别有力量。他俩一直用毛泽东思想统帅自己生命的每一秒钟，用毛泽东思想指挥自己顽强地战斗。
    不一会，下面又传来了毛新平的声音：“我要见太阳！”
    吴绍谦听了，热血涌上心头。他无比激动地对毛新平说：“我们一定会见到我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席！”
    两颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，紧紧地贴在一起。这两个深埋在井下的战友，我们时代的英雄，心中只有毛主席，泰山压顶志不移。吴绍谦和毛新平用尽全身力气连续高呼：
    “毛主席万岁！”
    “毛主席万岁！”
    这时候，正在井里抢救的三连九班长、共产党员汪立勤已经挖到一丈多深，听见从石缝中传出这个最振奋人心的声音，他马上高兴地向上面连声喊道：“不要讲话！不要讲话！”全场立即肃静下来。只听见井底又传出一声：“毛主席万岁！”
    这声音，冲破土层，穿过石缝，传到了上面。顿时，支撑架上爆发出一片“毛主席万岁！”的口号声，整个现场爆发出一片“毛主席万岁！”的口号声。
    从这时起，人们怕碰伤阶级兄弟，马上扔掉了手里的锹镐，用手拚死拚活地猛挖泥土、狠扒石头。
    突然，有人喊道：“注意，危险！”井壁出现大裂缝，碎石哗哗往下掉。巨大的险情在威胁着人们。
    “独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”
    老工人阎德胜和三连二班长、共产党员程志海冲下了井，碎石打在他俩背上，他俩说：“井塌下来，咱俩一人顶它半拉！”一块大石头，正好压在吴绍谦头顶上方，他俩一鼓作气，一下子就把石头掀开了。
    吴绍谦的头部露出来啦！人们的心都一齐飞向井里。战士把一顶军帽送了下来，社员把一顶柳条帽传了下来，工人把一顶安全帽递了下来。三顶帽子，情深似海！显示了工农兵在毛泽东思想基础上的伟大团结。“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”
    险情再一次严重。
    吴绍谦头部背后的井壁上有几块石头已经松动，随时都会倒塌下来。说时迟，那时快，三连四班长、共产党员李志林，猛然扑在吴绍谦头部。他用腿紧紧顶住一块就要倒塌下来的巨石，一动也不动。吴绍谦抖动着双手要把自己头上的安全帽摘下来给李志林戴上，李志林连忙按住他的双手，用自己的身体紧紧地掩护着吴绍谦。
    把吴绍谦救出来时已经下午四点多钟，天空下起了小雨。人们冒雨围着躺在担架上的吴绍谦，他说：“我没有完成任务，毛主席的红卫兵还没有救上来！”大家感动而又敬佩地说：“不！你已经很好地完成了任务，你为捍卫毛主席革命路线又立了新功！”大家关切地问他的伤势，他急迫地说：“不用管我，红卫兵还在井下！”人们含着泪花高呼：“向解放军学习！向解放军致敬！”吴绍谦激动地举手高呼：“毛主席万岁！”抢救现场立即沸腾起来，“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声，一阵高过一阵。消息传遍了全村，传到了矿区，传到了四十里外的钢城，人们都在高呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想创造了新的英雄奇迹！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的光辉思想哺育了多少象吴绍谦这样的英雄战士！他在用生命和鲜血抢救红卫兵的战斗中，被埋在井下九小时，全身七处负伤，是什么力量使他坚持到最后胜利？英雄排长吴绍谦说：“在井下九小时，我不疼，是毛泽东思想给了我最大的力量；我不饿，是毛泽东思想给了我精神食粮；我不冷，是毛泽东思想给了我最温暖的阳光。心中想着毛主席，就是胜利！”
    把人民的利益放在第一位
    排长吴绍谦刚刚救出，井壁又塌陷了！人们用双手刚把井里的石土挖出两丈多深，现在又埋上了好几尺石土。
    天空中，闷雷一阵紧一阵，闪电一个接一个，一场瓢泼大雨倾泻下来。这次塌方和大雨，给抢救毛新平增加了更大的困难。
    人们奔向井口，拉开雨布，用身子支着雨布，不让一滴雨点掉到井里。暴雨下得人睁不开眼，喘不过气，雨水顺着大家的头发、脊背往下淌。大家纹丝不动。
    大雨中，三连同志齐声背诵毛主席语录，继续奋战在井边。这个南征北战、屡建战功的连队，发出了钢铁誓言：“不救出红卫兵，决不下火线！”
    井下抢救急需照明。一个工人顶着滚雷闪电和大雨，飞快爬上了电线杆接上了电源。顿时，一排电灯把全场照得通亮通亮！
    风雨之夜，多少人头顶大雨，脚踩泥浆，双手紧紧拉着通向井底吊运石土的粗大绳索，战斗在井边、井下。站在支撑架上的老工人，用双手托着大筐，一层一层往上送，不让一块石头脱落，砸伤井下的阶级兄弟。
    指挥抢救的鞍山市革委会常委田芝庆，鞍山支左部队副部队长王林，鞍钢樱桃园铁矿革委会主任穆春阳，和群众一直战斗在第一线。送来雨衣，他们让给群众穿；送来饭菜，他们让给群众吃。
    艰苦的战斗持续到第二天清晨五点。人们把井挖到三丈多深的时候，从石缝中看见了毛新平。这时，井壁又出现了一寸多宽的大裂缝，碎石纷纷下落，支撑架挤得格格直响！
    “关键时刻，革委会成员应当挺身而出，冲上第一线！”穆春阳马上组织了由革委会成员组成的抢救突击队。他站在突击队面前，带领大家高举《毛主席语录》，朗读最高指示：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    “发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战
  （即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”
    穆春阳，这个当过童工的革命好干部，和大家一起朗诵毛主席的伟大教导，热泪盈眶，浑身是劲，仿佛毛主席就在身边指挥战斗！
    当突击队快要下井时，在现场送饭送水的红卫兵小将，捧着两碗热水，送到他们面前：“井下冷，喝口热水再下！”突击队员们抑制不住心头的激动，迈开健步，冲下井去。
    革委会成员的表率作用激励着老工人郭洪俊。他身体瘦弱，五次争着下井都被挡住。此刻，他几个箭步抢到井口，又被人拉住：“你身体不好，不要下。”这个深受旧社会压迫剥削的工人，在全矿区第一个和走资派进行拚死斗争的无产阶级革命派战士着急了：“我在矿井里摆弄了十多年石头，怎么不能下！”他使劲一甩胳膊就下了井。井壁的石头，块块活动，郭洪俊心想：“我老郭死了不要紧，可不能伤着阶级兄弟！”他便对支撑架上的同志说：“发生塌方你们快上去，不要管我！”
    毛新平的上半身露出来了。郭洪俊无限深情地望着他，万分激动，抱住毛新平，连声呼唤：“小将！小将！小将！”
    经过二十五小时的激烈战斗，人们硬是用双手把这口填平了的三丈多深的井挖到了底，终于把毛新平救了出来。由于毛新平被压在井底时间过长，经抢救无效，光荣地献出了年轻的生命。他以他短暂的一生，写成了一章完全彻底执行毛主席指示的壮丽诗篇。
    他没有死。他永远活在人们心中！
    烈士母亲肖玉静说：“孩子，你为人民而死，死得其所，死得光荣。妈要向你学习。孩子，你听着，妈给你背诵你教给妈的几段毛主席语录：‘你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！’”她一口气背诵了好几段毛主席语录，接着说：“孩子，你没有走完的路，妈接着走！”
    英雄母亲的话，道出了千百万人的共同心愿。
