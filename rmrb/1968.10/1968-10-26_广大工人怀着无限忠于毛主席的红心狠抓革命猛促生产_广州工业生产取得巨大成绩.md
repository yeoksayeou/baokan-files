Guangzhou's industrial production has achieved great success. In September, the city's total industrial output value increased by more than 30% compared to August, which had already seen a significant increase from July. Most products saw a notable increase in production, with some even surpassing historical highs.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou on October 25, the working class in Guangzhou has enthusiastically responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, "The working class must lead everything." While sending large numbers of workers to join Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to take charge of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various domains of the superstructure, the workers who remain in the factories are vigorously promoting revolution and production, achieving great success. Currently, industrial production in the city is thriving, and a new, magnificent production upsurge is forming.

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." In the great tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the revolutionary workers in various factories, mines, and enterprises in Guangzhou are full of spirit and high morale. They channel the boundless enthusiasm ignited by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, with everyone volunteering to take on heavy tasks. Despite the shortage of labor, they continue to create new achievements. The revolutionary workers of the Guangzhou Silk and Hemp Factory not only took on the production tasks of comrades who joined the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams but also restarted 4,000 spindles and 60 looms that had been idle due to labor shortages. Since September, production has surged, and the factory completed its September production plan three days ahead of schedule, with the total output of woven goods increasing by 1.7 times compared to August. The revolutionary workers of the Guangzhou Paper Mill enthusiastically launched labor competitions, with the average daily output of newsprint increasing by 46% in September compared to August. The revolutionary workers of the Guangzhou Chemical Factory actively tapped into production potential, increasing the electrolytic current from 4,000 amperes to 9,000 amperes, and the daily output of the main product, caustic soda, increased severalfold. Due to the revolutionary workers' full enthusiasm and striving for progress, Guangzhou's total industrial output value, which had already seen a significant increase in August compared to July, increased by 37.15% in September compared to August. The production of most products has seen a notable increase, with some even surpassing historical highs.

With deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the working class in Guangzhou fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by Liu Shaoqi. They greatly changed the backward situation where bourgeois technical "authorities" monopolized technology. A 10-ton boiler in the Guangzhou Oil and Fat Chemical Factory had been out of order for several months, seriously affecting production. In early September, under the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees, 18 revolutionary workers from the Guangzhou Boiler Factory were organized to participate in the emergency repair project. With hearts full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the workers, guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fully demonstrated the fearless revolutionary spirit of the working class, overcoming numerous difficulties. They completed the emergency repair project, which bourgeois technical "authorities" claimed would take three months or even half a year, in just 12 days. They also made many major technological improvements. The workers in the seamless steel pipe workshop of the Guangzhou Steel Plant bravely took on the production of a type of high-quality steel pipe that had never been produced before, completing the task in just 36 hours from raw material input to product output. They produced more than 10 tons of high-quality steel pipes, completing a task that would have taken more than 10 days in the past. The workers in the fiber workshop of the Guangzhou Silk and Hemp Factory followed Chairman Mao's teachings to break superstitions and liberate thoughts, relying on the collective rather than experts, and firmly kicking out the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities." They attacked technological bottlenecks and, in just half a month, overcame the technological difficulties in producing 36-count hemp yarn that so-called "experts" had failed to solve for a long time. These facts vividly prove that the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought is invincible.

Recently, the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a meeting attended by the chairmen of the revolutionary committees of various major factories, mines, and enterprises. The meeting called on all revolutionary workers in the city to further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, and promote production through revolution. It called on the members of the revolutionary committees of various factories, mines, and enterprises to go deep among the masses and to the production frontlines, fully playing the leading role of the working class, enthusiastically supporting the pioneering spirit of the worker masses, actively launching the "learn from each other, help each other, catch up, and surpass" movement, striving to complete and overfulfill the annual production tasks, and making preparations for an even greater production upsurge next year.

    广大工人怀着无限忠于毛主席的红心狠抓革命猛促生产
    广州工业生产取得巨大成绩
    全市工业总产值在八月份比七月份大大增长的基础上，九月份又比八月份增长百分之三十多，大部产品产量都有显著增长，有的还超过了历史上最高水平
    据新华社广州二十五日电　广州市工人阶级热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大号召，在派出大批工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上层建筑各个领域领导斗、批、改的同时，留厂的广大工人狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了巨大成绩。目前，全市工业生产蒸蒸日上，一个波澜壮阔的新的生产高潮正在形成。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，广州各厂矿企业的广大革命工人意气风发，斗志昂扬，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出的冲天干劲用到生产上，人人争挑重担，在人少任务重的情况下，不断创造出新的成就。广州绢麻厂的革命职工，不仅承担起参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志的生产任务，而且把原来因为劳力不足而停开的四千多个纱锭、六十多台织布机全部开动起来。九月份以来，生产大幅度上升，提前三天完成了九月份的生产计划，织布总产量比八月份增长一点七倍。广州造纸厂革命职工，热烈开展劳动竞赛，九月份新闻纸的平均日产量比八月份增长百分之四十六。广州化工厂革命职工积极挖掘生产潜力，把电解电流从四千安培，提高到九千安培，主要产品烧碱的日产量成倍上升。由于广大革命工人鼓足干劲，力争上游，广州市的工业总产值在八月份比七月份大大增长的基础上，九月份又比八月份增长百分之三十七点一五，大部分产品产量都有显著增长，有的还超过了历史上的最高水平。
    广州工人阶级怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义办企业路线，大大改变了资产阶级技术“权威”垄断技术时的落后状况。广州油脂化工厂的一座十吨锅炉，已经坏了几个月，使生产受到严重影响。九月初，在广东省和广州市革委会的领导下，组织了广州锅炉厂的十八名革命工人参加这项抢修工程。工人们怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想指挥战斗，充分发扬工人阶级大无畏的革命精神，战胜重重困难，只用短短十二天的时间就完成了那些资产阶级技术“权威”认为需要三个月甚至半年才能完成的抢修工程，并且有许多重大的技术改革。广州钢铁厂无缝钢管车间的工人，为了支援广州化工厂抢修设备，勇敢地承担了一种从来没有生产过而又要求很高的钢管的生产任务，他们把完成这项任务，作为向毛主席表忠心的具体表现，把生产仗作为政治仗来打，从投料到生产出产品，只三十六个小时就胜利地轧出了十多吨优质钢管，完成了按过去需要十多天才能完成的任务。广州绢麻厂纤维车间的工人，遵照毛主席破除迷信，解放思想的教导，不靠专家靠大家，坚决踢开资产阶级反动技术“权威”，猛攻技术关键，仅用半个月时间，就攻克了所谓绢麻“专家”过去长期没有解决的生产三十六支麻纱的技术难关。这些事实雄辩地证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级无往而不胜。
    广州市革命委员会最近召开了有各大厂矿企业革委会主任参加的会议，号召全市革命工人进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，认真搞好斗、批、改，以革命带动生产；号召各厂矿企业革委会的成员，深入群众，深入生产第一线，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，热情支持工人群众的首创精神，积极开展比、学、赶、帮运动，争取完成和超额完成全年的生产任务，为迎接明年更大的生产高潮做好准备。
