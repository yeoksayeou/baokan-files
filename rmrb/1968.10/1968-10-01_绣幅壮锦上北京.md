	Embroidering Beijing on a Bold Brocade
	By Zhuang People Huang Deyu and Wei Libin

	Cut the brightest red from the sky,
	Pick the brightest stars from the Milky Way,
	Use pines and cypresses as needles, rainbows as thread,
	Embroider Beijing on a bold brocade.

	First, embroider the rising sun in the east,
	Chairman Mao waves his hand to guide the course,
	Next, embroider the revolutionary people of the Zhuang,
	Follow the commander forward.

	Sunflowers bloom towards the sun,
	Red hearts all turn towards Beijing,
	Chairman Mao's kindness is endless,
	The loyalty of the Zhuang people cannot be fully embroidered.

	The golden thread is long, the affection is deep,
	Embroider Beijing on a bold brocade,
	Offered to the savior Chairman Mao,
	To express the heartfelt devotion of the Zhuang people.

    绣幅壮锦上北京
    壮族　黄德玉　韦立斌
    剪来天上最红的霞，
    摘下银河最亮的星，
    松柏作针虹作线啊，
    绣幅壮锦上北京。
    先绣东方旭日升，
    毛主席挥手指航程，
    再绣壮家革命人啊，
    紧跟统帅向前进。
    葵花朵朵向阳开，
    红心颗颗向着北京城，
    毛主席的恩情说不完啊，
    壮族人民的忠诚绣不尽。
    金丝长哟情意深，
    绣幅壮锦上北京，
    献给救星毛主席啊，
    表表壮族人民一片心。
