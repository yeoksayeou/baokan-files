Angry Protest Against the Reactionary Government's Indifference to the People's Lives

The people of West Bengal, India, who have suffered severe floods, held an anti-government demonstration on October 24 to protest against the Indian reactionary government's indifference to the people's lives.

According to reports, on that day, Indira Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister, hypocritically pretended to "care for the people in the disaster-stricken areas" and flew to Jalpaiguri in northern West Bengal by helicopter for a so-called "inspection." Immediately, three to four thousand angry people gathered in front of her residence to demonstrate. The reactionary authorities in Jalpaiguri dispatched a large number of police to suppress the demonstrators, beating them with iron-tipped batons. On the spot, more than seventy people were injured. This brutal act by the reactionary police further enraged the demonstrators, who threw bricks and stones at Indira Gandhi's residence and rushed into the courtyard of her residence. At this point, the terrified Indira Gandhi hurriedly climbed onto a grape trellis in the courtyard, hypocritically stating that the "government would consider all the demands of the people." However, the demonstrators did not believe her lies and insisted that Indira Gandhi leave the residence and meet all the demonstrators. Amidst the demonstrators' condemnation, this leader of the Indian reactionary government hurriedly climbed down from the grape trellis and, under the protection of her entourage, sneaked out through a side door and hastily boarded a helicopter to escape to Darjeeling.

Not long ago, when India's Deputy Prime Minister Desai came to this place for a so-called "inspection of the disaster-stricken areas," the local people also held demonstrations against the central and state governments. The demonstrators even threw stones and mud at the jeep he was riding in, and Desai also fled in disgrace amidst the demonstrators' angry resistance.

According to Indian newspapers, recently, severe floods have occurred in West Bengal, Assam, and Bihar in northeastern India. The population in the affected areas is over five million, and tens of thousands have been surrounded by floodwaters. According to incomplete statistics, by the beginning of October, more than four thousand people had died.

    愤怒抗议反动政府不顾人民死活
    印度西孟加拉邦人民举行反政府示威
    反动政府头子英迪拉·甘地在群众谴责声中偷偷摸摸从旁门溜走
    新华社二十六日讯　新德里消息：遭受严重水灾的印度东北部西孟加拉邦人民，二十四日愤怒地举行反对印度总理英迪拉·甘地的示威，抗议印度反动政府不顾人民的死活。
    据报道，这天，英迪拉·甘地假仁假义地伪装成“关心灾区人民”的样子，乘直升飞机到西孟加拉邦北部贾尔派古里镇进行所谓“视察”时，立即有三、四千愤怒的群众聚集在她的住所前示威。贾尔派古里镇的反动当局派出大批警察镇压示威群众，用包铁皮的警棍殴打示威者，当场就有七十多人被打伤。反动警察的这一暴行更加激怒了示威群众，他们用砖头和石块猛砸英迪拉·甘地的住所，并且冲进了英迪拉·甘地住所的院子。这时，吓破了胆的英迪拉·甘地慌忙地爬上院子里的一座葡萄架上，假惺惺地表示“政府将考虑群众的一切要求”，但是示威群众不理睬她这套谎言，坚决要英迪拉·甘地滚出住所和所有示威者见面。在示威群众的一片谴责声中，这个印度反动政府的头子又慌忙地从葡萄架上爬了下来，在护从人员的保护下，偷偷摸摸地从旁门仓忙溜出，坐上直升飞机，逃往大吉岭县。
    不久前，印度副总理德赛到这个地方进行所谓“视察灾区”时，当地群众也曾举行了反对中央政府和邦政府的示威，示威群众还用石头和泥块砸了他乘坐的吉普车，德赛也是在示威群众愤怒的反抗声中狼狈逃走的。
    据印度报纸报道，最近印度东北部西孟加拉邦、阿萨姆邦、比哈尔邦发生严重水灾，受灾地区人口有五百多万，被洪水围困的已有几十万人，据不完全统计，到十月初，已经有四千人死亡。
