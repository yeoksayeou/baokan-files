The Ceylon Communist Party General Secretary Samugathasan published an article in the September 30 issue of the Ceylon Communist Party's *Red Flag* weekly, discussing the international significance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The article states: "China is a great country with a population of over 700 million, making it the most populous country in the world. It has inherited a great civilization, perhaps the oldest in the world, with a history of over 5,000 years. It was this country that first made many new inventions for the world, such as printing and the manufacture of gunpowder, etc.

"But today, we must acknowledge that China has produced the greatest figure in the world—Comrade Mao Zedong, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong is one of the rare geniuses who will influence the fate of humanity. He is not just for the Chinese people, just as Marx is not just for the Germans and Lenin is not just for the Russians. They are all great internationalists, whose thoughts, actions, and influences transcend the borders of the countries where they were born. The major international significance of Mao Zedong Thought lies here."

The article discusses Lenin's great achievement in developing Marxism and raising it to the level of Leninism. It continues: "In the long struggle against foreign imperialism, domestic feudalism, and capitalism, through various twists and turns, Comrade Mao Zedong led the Chinese revolution to victory, demonstrating his ability to apply the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism to China's specific conditions. In this way, he further developed Marxism-Leninism and raised it to the new height of Mao Zedong Thought that we speak of today."

The article states: "In the long and arduous struggle for the victory of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, with his great genius, made many contributions to the development of Marxism-Leninism thought."

The article says: "It is difficult to evaluate all the important contributions Comrade Mao Zedong has made to the development of Marxism-Leninism in a short article. However, I particularly want to quote his words on the three main weapons that won the Chinese revolution: 'A disciplined party armed with Marxism-Leninism theory, practicing self-criticism, and linked with the masses. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and revolutionary factions led by such a party. These three are our main weapons to defeat the enemy.'

"In this brief quotation, Comrade Mao Zedong, with rare conciseness, summarized the three basic conditions necessary for the success of the revolution in the current situation in any country. These conditions are: (1) leadership by a disciplined Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, (2) a people's army led by such a party, and (3) a united front of revolutionary forces. We must pay special attention to these basic conditions for the success of the revolution, especially in a country like Ceylon, where modern revisionism and reformism have deceived a considerable part of the masses."

The article states: "One of Comrade Mao Zedong's outstanding contributions in the field of philosophy is his exposition of the theory of contradictions. He brilliantly pointed out that the theory of contradictions and the unity of opposites is the most important fundamental law of dialectical materialism."

The article states: Mao Zedong, by correctly understanding the law of contradictions, was able to clearly predict that even after the socialist revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, classes still exist, and therefore, class struggle will be a feature of the entire historical period of transition from socialism to communism, which will take a very long time. This understanding enabled Comrade Mao Zedong to correctly lead the Chinese Communist Party to take the necessary steps to prevent the recurrence of the events that took place in the Soviet Union, where the denial of the existence of classes and class struggle led to the emergence of modern revisionism and the restoration of capitalism.

The article states: "It is precisely because of his deep understanding of the law of contradictions that Comrade Mao Zedong was able to initiate and personally lead the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With the complete victory of the revolutionary organs of power in all provinces and autonomous regions of the People's Republic of China (except Taiwan Province), this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories today. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great class struggle between two completely opposing forces: one led by the Chinese Khrushchev, aiming to restore capitalism; the other led by Chairman Mao's revolutionary headquarters, aiming to carry the revolution through to the end, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and defend and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

"The victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution so far are not only the victories of the revolutionary forces within China; they are a great victory and a source of inspiration for the entire international communist movement. The fact that China has been preserved as a base for world revolution is a reliable sign of the impending victory of world socialism. Today, China is to the rest of the world what the liberated areas were to the rest of China before liberation. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entirely due to Comrade Mao Zedong's correct personal leadership of this revolution. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

The article states: "Another great contribution Comrade Mao Zedong has made to Marxism-Leninism is his role in leading the struggle against modern revisionism. Just as Lenin, in his fierce struggle against the revisionists of his time, rediscovered and reaffirmed the basic truths of Marxism and developed it to a higher stage, in the great struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism today, Comrade Mao Zedong has rediscovered and reaffirmed the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and developed it to a new height. One only needs to ask oneself: What would have happened to the international revolutionary movement if China had followed Russia and joined the ranks of revisionism? In this way, one can recognize the great and historical international significance of the great ideological struggle between the Chinese Communist Party, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and modern revisionism centered around the CPSU. This great ideological struggle not only defended Marxism-Leninism; it also revitalized the entire international communist movement and determined the final defeat of world imperialism along with its pillar, modern revisionism."

The article concludes: "Therefore, just as in Lenin's time, to oppose Leninism was to oppose Marxism, today, to oppose Mao Zedong Thought is to oppose Marxism-Leninism. Today, to support Marxism-Leninism without supporting Mao Zedong Thought—the highest stage of the development of Marxism-Leninism—is meaningless. Mao Zedong Thought is the most advanced revolutionary thought in the world today. Mao Zedong Thought is the sole correct guide for the revolutionary movements of all oppressed peoples.

"This is why the task of all revolutionaries today is to master Mao Zedong Thought and apply it to the specific conditions of their own countries."

    阐述毛泽东思想的重大国际意义
    革命者的任务是掌握毛泽东思想，并运用毛泽东思想于本国的具体情况
    新华社科伦坡十一日电　锡兰共产党总书记桑穆加塔桑在九月三十日出版的锡共《红旗》周刊上发表文章，阐述了毛泽东思想的国际意义。
    文章说：“中国是一个伟大的国家，人口已超过七亿，是世界上人口最多的国家。她继承了伟大的文明，也许是世界上最悠久的文明，有五千多年的历史。正是这个国家首先为全世界作出了许多新发明，如印刷，制造火药，等等。
    “但是，在今天，必须承认，中国出了世界上最伟大的人物——毛泽东同志，当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志是定将影响人类命运的罕见的天才之一。他不是仅仅属于中国人的，正如马克思不是仅仅属于德国人的和列宁不是仅仅属于俄国人的一样。他们都是伟大的国际主义者，他们的思想、活动和影响超越他们所出生的国家的边界。毛泽东思想的国际重大意义就在这里。”
    文章谈到了列宁发展了马克思主义，把马克思主义提高到列宁主义阶段的伟大功绩。文章接着说：“毛泽东同志在反对外国帝国主义、本国封建主义和资本主义的长期斗争过程中，经过种种曲折的道路把中国革命引向胜利，显示了他把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理运用于中国具体条件的才能。这样，他就进一步发展了马克思列宁主义，并把马克思列宁主义提高到我们今天所说的毛泽东思想的新的高度。”
    文章说：“在争取中国革命胜利的长期斗争的艰苦曲折的道路上，毛泽东同志以伟大的天才，对马克思列宁主义思想的发展作出了许多贡献。”
    文章说：“要在一篇短文里评价毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义的发展作出的全部重要贡献，那是很难的。但是我特别愿意引用他所说的使中国革命取得胜利的三件主要武器：‘一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶级各革命派别的统一战线。这三件是我们战胜敌人的主要武器。’
    “在这条短短的语录里，毛泽东同志用罕有的简洁语言，概括了在目前情况下任何国家的革命取得成功所必须的三个基本条件。这些条件是（一）一个有纪律的马克思列宁主义的共产党的领导，（二）一个由这样的党领导的人民军队，（三）各革命力量的统一战线。我们再次注意任何国家，特别是象锡兰这样的国家——在那里，现代修正主义和改良主义欺骗了相当一部分群众——争取革命成功的这些基本条件是很重要的。”
    文章说：“毛泽东同志在哲学方面作出的杰出贡献之一是，他阐述了关于矛盾的学说。他天才地指出关于矛盾和对立统一的学说是唯物辩证法最重要的根本法则。”
    文章说：毛泽东同志由于正确地理解矛盾的法则，所以才能够清楚地预言，甚至在社会主义革命之后和无产阶级专政建立之后，阶级依然存在，因此，阶级斗争将是在从社会主义向共产主义过渡——这将经历一段很长的时间——的整个历史时期里的一个特点。这种理解使毛泽东同志能够正确领导中国共产党采取必要的步骤来防止重演在苏联发生过的事件——在苏联，由于否认阶级和阶级斗争的存在，造成了现代修正主义的出现和资本主义的复辟。
    文章说：“毛泽东同志正是由于对矛盾的法则的深刻理解，才能发动和亲自领导无产阶级文化大革命，随着在中华人民共和国各省和自治区（除台湾省外）革命的政权机关的全部胜利建立，这场文化大革命今天已经取得了伟大的胜利。这场无产阶级文化大革命实际上是两种完全对立的力量之间的一场巨大的阶级斗争，这两种力量，一种是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首、企图使中国回到资本主义复辟的道路上的力量；另一种是由毛泽东主席的革命司令部领导的、要把革命进行到底、防止资本主义复辟、保卫和加强无产阶级专政的力量。
    “无产阶级文化大革命到目前为止所取得的胜利，不仅是中国国内革命力量的胜利，它是整个革命的国际共产主义运动的伟大的胜利和鼓舞的泉源。中国得以作为一个世界革命的根据地保存下来，这一事实是世界社会主义即将胜利的可靠的预兆。中国今天对世界其余地区来说，正如解放前，解放区对中国其余地区一样。无产阶级文化大革命的这一伟大胜利，完全是由于毛泽东同志对这一革命的正确的亲自领导。这是毛泽东思想的胜利。”
    文章说：“毛泽东对马克思列宁主义作出的另一巨大贡献是，他在领导同现代修正主义的斗争中所起的作用。正如列宁在同当时的修正主义者进行激烈的斗争中重新发现和重新阐明马克思主义的基本真理并把它发展到一个更高的阶段一样，在当前马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义之间进行的大搏斗中，毛泽东同志重新发现和重新阐明了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，并把它发展到一个新的高度。人们只要问一问自己：如果中国追随俄国加入了修正主义阵营，那末，国际革命运动将会发生什么情况呢？这样，他将能认识到，在毛泽东同志领导下，中国共产党同以苏共为领导中心的现代修正主义所进行的思想斗争的巨大的、历史性的国际意义。这次大的思想斗争不仅捍卫了马克思列宁主义，它也使整个国际共产主义运动重新出现生气勃勃的局面，并注定了世界帝国主义连同其支柱现代修正主义的最后失败。”
    文章最后说：“因此，正如在列宁时代，谁反对列宁主义，实际上就是反对马克思主义一样，今天，谁反对毛泽东思想，就是反对马克思列宁主义。今天，拥护马克思列宁主义，如果不拥护毛泽东思想——马克思列宁主义发展的最高阶段——那是毫无意义的。毛泽东思想是当今世界上最先进的革命思想。毛泽东思想是一切被压迫人民的革命运动的唯一正确的指针。
    “这就是为什么今天一切革命者的任务是掌握毛泽东思想并运用毛泽东思想于本国的具体情况的原因。”
