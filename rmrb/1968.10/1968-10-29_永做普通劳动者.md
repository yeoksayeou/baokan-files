	Always Be an Ordinary Laborer
	Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee of Gaoquan Brigade, Tangzhuang People's Commune, Xie County, Henan, Yuan Qingshui

	The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and regard revolutionary interests as the first priority, and subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests." However, China's Khrushchev goes against Chairman Mao and vigorously promotes the "join the party to become an official" theory. I joined the party in 1956. Due to being poisoned by the "join the party to become an official" theory, my thoughts gradually changed, always feeling that I was superior to others, speaking and acting with the attitude of a leader. The poor brothers who used to be with me all day long were afraid that I would become detached from the masses and make mistakes, and often helped me, but I thought they were picking on me. Over time, they no longer wanted to talk to me, and they no longer raised issues in front of me. I couldn't hear the opinions of the masses and didn't want to listen to the opinions of the masses.

	At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the community members posted big-character posters about me, helping me, but I couldn't understand it. After the provincial and county party rectification investigation team came to our brigade, they held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for party rectification and building. I entered the study class with a belly full of anger. However, in the study class, I learned Chairman Mao's great teachings: "We Communists are not seeking official positions, but are seeking revolution. We must have a thorough spirit of revolution. We must not for a moment be detached from the masses." I deeply criticized and denounced China's Khrushchev's "join the party to become an official" theory, listened to the bitter complaints of old poor peasants about the old society, and listening, listening, I was deeply educated, and I couldn't help but shed tears. In the old society, my family was poor, with little to eat and wear. At the age of ten, I followed my mother to beg for food, worked for the landlord, endured beatings and insults, and suffered greatly. After liberation, I stood up, joined the party, but I forgot my roots, forgot the masses, and stood high above them, truly letting down Chairman Mao. After my awareness was raised, I actively checked my mistakes.

	When the brigade revolutionary committee was established, the poor and lower-middle peasants elected me as the deputy director. I thought, although my position has changed, I cannot forget the nature of the laboring people. In the past, China's Khrushchev implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and some cadres were detached from labor and the masses for a long time, standing high above them, becoming officials and lords. I cannot take this old road again. Reviewing my past mistakes, checking the causes, it was the result of being poisoned by China's Khrushchev's "join the party to become an official" theory and being detached from the masses. This time, the poor and lower-middle peasants elected me as the deputy director of the revolutionary committee, which is the trust of the masses. My power comes from the poor and lower-middle peasants, the party, and Chairman Mao. I must hold power well for the poor and lower-middle peasants, use power well, and make the party and Chairman Mao proud. Therefore, no matter how busy the work is every day, I must participate in collective labor.

	From this period of practice, I deeply feel that: a party member, joining the party is not for the sake of becoming an official, but for the sake of revolution. If one has the word "official" in one's mind after joining the party, one will be detached from the masses. Only by not being detached from the masses and labor can one always maintain revolutionary youthfulness.

    永做普通劳动者
    河南汲县唐庄公社郭全屯大队革委会副主任　袁清水
    伟大的导师毛主席教导我们说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。而中国赫鲁晓夫却与毛主席唱反调，竭力鼓吹“入党做官论”。我是一九五六年入党的。由于中了“入党做官论”的毒，思想慢慢起了变化，总觉得自己高人一头，说话、办事都以领导身份出现。原来和自己整天滚在一起的穷哥们，怕我脱离群众，犯错误，多次对我进行帮助，而自己却认为他们挑自己的毛病。时间长了，他们就不愿和我谈心了，当着我的面也不提意见了。自己听不到群众的意见，也听不进群众的意见。
    在无产阶级文化大革命初期，社员贴了我一些大字报，对我进行帮助，自己想不通。省、县整党调查组到俺队后，举办了整党建党毛泽东思想学习班，我带着一肚子气进了学习班。但是在学习班里学习了毛主席“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众”的伟大教导，深揭猛批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官论”，听了苦大仇深的老贫农对旧社会的血泪控诉，听着，听着，使我受到深刻的教育，我情不自禁地流下了眼泪。旧社会我一家少吃没穿，十几岁就跟母亲逃荒，给地主扛活，挨打受气，受尽了折磨。解放后，翻了身，入了党，自己却忘了本，忘了群众，高高在上，真对不起毛主席。认识提高后，我主动地检查了自己的错误。
    大队革委会成立时，贫下中农选我当了革委会副主任。我想，地位变了，劳动人民的本色不能忘。过去中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线，一部分干部长期脱离劳动，脱离群众，高高在上，做官当老爷，自己不能再走这一条老路。回顾以前自己犯的错误，检查原因，就是在中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官论”毒害下，脱离群众的结果。这次贫下中农选我当革委会副主任，是大家对我的信任。我的权力是贫下中农、党和毛主席给的。我一定为贫下中农掌好权，用好权，为党和毛主席争气。所以，每天工作不管怎样忙，我都要参加集体劳动。
    从这一段实践中，我深深地体会到：一个党员，入党不是为了做官，而是为了革命，如果入党后思想上有了“官”字，就要脱离群众。只有不脱离群众，不脱离劳动，才能永葆革命青春。
