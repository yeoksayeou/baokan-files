Following the great leader Chairman Mao's great instruction on cadres going down to the countryside to labor, Fenyi County sends a large number of cadres to the countryside to settle down.

More than 1,900 cadres, revolutionary teachers and students, and medical personnel have taken root in the countryside, accepting re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. They enthusiastically say, "We are determined to shed a layer of skin, roll in a layer of mud, reform our worldview, and revolutionize to the end!" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically welcome the down-to-the-countryside personnel with gongs and drums.

Editor's Note: The report on the large number of cadres from Fenyi County, Jiangxi Province, going down to the countryside to settle down vividly illustrates the joyful achievements that cadres going down to the countryside to labor have brought to the revolutionization of the organs and cadres; it illustrates the profound social changes that cadres going down to the countryside to labor have brought about. The poor and lower-middle peasants have said well: "City people go to the countryside to be farmers, the customs have changed!" This change in customs fundamentally breaks the old feudal class ideology of "those who labor with their minds rule over others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled by others" that has persisted for thousands of years, and establishes the new style of socialism and communism where cadres can go up and down, can be officials and common people. This change in customs is greatly beneficial to the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the countryside, making the new socialist countryside more vibrant and prosperous.

According to a report from our newspaper, starting from July this year, the Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great instruction on cadres participating in labor, has sent down more than 1,900 cadres, revolutionary teachers and students, and medical personnel to settle down in the countryside. This batch of down-to-the-countryside personnel, while directly accepting re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants in the three great revolutionary movements, contribute their strength to the construction of the new socialist countryside, and effectively combine the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world.

This batch of down-to-the-countryside personnel includes more than 500 cadres from the former county committee, county people's committee, and county-level professional institutions, more than 1,300 revolutionary teachers and students, and more than 60 medical personnel. Their families have all moved to the countryside. Now, all 13 communes and 98 production brigades in the county have down-to-the-countryside personnel.

This batch of down-to-the-countryside personnel has taken root in the countryside, participated in labor, and lived among the poor and lower-middle peasants, directly accepting re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, greatly accelerating the ideological revolutionization of cadres, teachers, and medical personnel. Some cadres have been in the organs for many years without going down to the countryside or rarely going down, and they indignantly say, "Once you enter the organ's gate, it's like entering a birdcage." This time, they walked out of the organs and rushed to the vast countryside, and everyone was spirited. They said, "We are determined to shed a layer of skin, roll in a layer of mud, reform our worldview, and revolutionize to the end!" A cadre of poor peasant origin, due to long-term separation from labor, had developed "three thinnesses": calluses on the palms had thinned, skin on the soles of the feet had thinned, and feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants had thinned. This time, he brought his entire family to the production brigade to settle down, took off his cadre uniform, put on peasant clothes, wore self-made straw shoes, and labored with the poor and lower-middle peasants. "Three thinnesses" turned into "three thicknesses." He deeply felt, "The thicker the calluses on the palms, the deeper the feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the stronger the anti-revisionism and anti-capitalist restoration forces." Some cadres who went from the home gate to the school gate to the organ gate, this time came to the countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants gave them hoes, rain hats, and shoulder poles "three treasures," taught them how to plow and hoe, and told them to never leave labor and the masses. They excitedly said, "This time, from 'three gates' to the gate of the poor and lower-middle peasants, truly touching the door of revolutionization." Young students, in the three great revolutionary struggles, experienced the storms of class struggle, and the poor and lower-middle peasants gave them a class struggle education course. They deeply felt, "In the countryside, the teachers are excellent, the textbooks are solid, the education is profound, and the results are immediate." They are determined to, in the process of integrating with workers and peasants, transform and temper themselves into strong proletarian revolutionary fighters.

This batch of down-to-the-countryside personnel is also a powerful force in building the new socialist countryside. Some cadres, originally confined to the organs, rooted in armchairs, and befriended reports and telephones, this time, after going down to the countryside, fought alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, held large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, set up revolutionary criticism columns, and established class struggle exhibition halls, and carried out the mass movement to learn from Dazhai on a larger scale, "heroes" had a place to show their prowess. A small village in a remote mountain gorge, with no one who had ever gone to school for generations, after liberation, cultivated an elementary school graduate who was then transferred to the commune to be a cadre. The poor and lower-middle peasants had to go to the commune to ask cadres to help them study Chairman Mao's works. This time, the poor and lower-middle peasants specifically requested the elementary school graduate to return. He returned to his hometown, participated in labor while organizing the poor and lower-middle peasants to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said, "Chairman Mao cares most about us poor and lower-middle peasants, and the down-to-the-countryside cadres are most to our liking." In Fengyang Commune, a water conservancy project had been delayed for more than two years without completion. After the down-to-the-countryside personnel arrived, they learned from Dazhai with the poor and lower-middle peasants, grasped class struggle, and promoted production with revolution. In less than two months, the reservoir was completed. This batch of personnel also assisted the poor and lower-middle peasants in carrying out the educational revolution, establishing 271 primary schools, 82 junior high schools, and 12 senior high schools. Now, the entire county's countryside has basically achieved the goal of studying in primary school without leaving the production team, studying in junior high school without leaving the brigade, and studying in senior high school without leaving the commune, popularizing rural education. City "leather shoe doctors" have been transformed into "barefoot doctors," and more than 100 "barefoot doctors" have been trained for the countryside. The poor and lower-middle peasants' long-standing wish for a doctor in every brigade is gradually being realized.

Cadres settling down in the countryside are warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some production brigades sent representatives to the county to compete for down-to-the-countryside cadres, and some wrote letters and made phone calls asking when the down-to-the-countryside cadres would arrive. Many communes and brigades' poor and lower-middle peasants, like celebrating a joyous event, gathered in groups, beating gongs and drums, and some even drove tractors for dozens of miles to welcome them. They said, "Cadres going down to the countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants are most welcome, and class enemies are most afraid." They affectionately said, "New commune members have come," enthusiastically helping the "new commune members" clean the houses and proactively providing labor tools. Cadres from the organs going down to the countryside to settle down also changed the masses' view of the organs and cadres, and had a great impact on society. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "In the past, cadres were promoted upwards, youth ran out, and girls married out. Now, cadres are sent down to the countryside, youth go to the countryside, and families move to the countryside. City people go to the countryside to be farmers, the customs have changed!" Under the influence of the down-to-the-countryside cadres, more than 300 urban and suburban residents and idle laborers in the county have successively moved to the countryside to participate in socialist construction.

The Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee regards the down-to-the-countryside cadres as one of the channels to connect with the masses, regularly organizing them to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, reflecting the masses' opinions, demands, and voices, promoting the revolutionization of the organs, and improving the work of the Revolutionary Committee. At the same time, it is decided to implement the "rotation system" for organ cadres. That is, county and commune cadres on duty, including leading cadres, are planned to rotate in batches with those who have gone down to the countryside to settle down, cultivating cadres who can go up and down, can be officials and common people, ensuring that the organs are always full of revolutionary vigor.

Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a conference in Fenyi to summarize and promote the experience of organizing cadres to go down to the countryside to settle down. The conference believed that organizing cadres, revolutionary teachers and students, and medical personnel to go down to the countryside to settle down and accept re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants in the three great revolutionary movements provides new experience for reforming the superstructure that does not adapt to the socialist economic base, is a long-term strategy for anti-revisionism and anti-capitalist restoration, and has profound significance in accelerating the elimination of the three great differences. At the same time, it well embodies Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." Now, the provincial-level organs and various prefectures, cities, and counties in Jiangxi Province are organizing cadres, revolutionary teachers and students, and medical personnel to go down to the countryside, consciously accepting re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. With tens of thousands of down-to-the-countryside personnel heading to the countryside, it will not take long for Jiangxi Province to undergo inspiring and tremendous changes.

    遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于干部下放劳动的伟大教导
    分宜县下放大批干部到农村安家落户
    一千九百多名干部、革命师生和医务人员扎根农村，接受贫下中农的再教育。他们精神振奋地说：“我们决心脱它一层皮，滚它一身泥，改造世界观，革命干到底！”广大贫下中农敲锣打鼓，热烈欢迎下放人员
    编者按：江西省分宜县大批干部到农村安家落户的报道，生动地说明了，干部下放劳动，为机关革命化和干部革命化带来的可喜收获；说明了干部下放劳动所引起的深刻的社会变化。贫下中农说得好：“城里人下乡当农民，风气变了！”这种风气的改变，从根本上打破了几千年来“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的剥削阶级旧观念，树立起干部能上能下，能“官”能民的社会主义、共产主义新风尚。这种风气的改变，大大有利于农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，使社会主义的新农村更加朝气蓬勃，欣欣向荣。
    本报讯　从今年七月开始，江西省分宜县革命委员会，遵照毛主席关于干部参加劳动的伟大教导，先后下放了一千九百多名干部、革命师生和医务人员，到农村安家落户。这批下放人员，在三大革命运动中，一面直接接受贫下中农的再教育，一面为建设社会主义新农村贡献力量，把改造主观世界和改造客观世界很好地结合起来。
    这批下放人员，包括旧县委、县人委和县直属专业机构的五百多名干部、一千三百多名革命师生、六十多名医务人员。他们的家属也全部搬到乡下。现在，全县十三个公社、九十八个大队，社社、队队都有下放人员。
    这批下放人员扎根农村，参加劳动，生活在贫下中农中，直接接受贫下中农的再教育，大大加速了干部、师生和医务人员的思想革命化。有些干部进机关多年没有或很少下过乡，他们愤慨地说：“进了机关门，就象进鸟笼。”这次他们走出机关，奔向农村广阔天地，人人精神振奋。他们说：“我们决心脱它一层皮，滚它一身泥，改造世界观，革命干到底！”有个贫农出身的领导干部，由于长期脱离劳动，身上出现了“三薄”：手掌茧薄了，脚板皮薄了，和贫下中农的感情淡薄了。这次他带着全家到生产队安家落户，脱下干部服，换上农民装，穿起自己编的草鞋，和贫下中农同劳动，“三薄”变成了“三厚”。他深有感受地说：“掌上的茧厚一分，和贫下中农的感情就深一分，反修防修的力量就增一分。”有些从家门到校门到机关门的“三门”干部，这次来到农村，贫下中农送给他们锄头、斗笠、扁担“三样宝”，把着手教他们扶犁掌耙，要他们永远不脱离劳动，不脱离群众，他们激动地说：“这回由‘三门’迈进了贫下中农的门，真正摸到了革命化的门。”青年学生在三大革命斗争中，经受群众斗争的风雨，由贫下中农给他们补上了阶级斗争教育课，他们感受很深地说：“在农村，老师高明，教材过硬，教育深刻，立竿见影。”他们决心在与工农相结合中，把自己改造锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士。
    这批下放人员还是一支建设社会主义新农村的生力军。有些干部原来关在机关里，扎根在藤椅上，和表报交“朋友”，在电话机旁做文章。这次下放到农村，和贫下中农战斗在一起，大办毛泽东思想学习班，办革命大批判专栏，办阶级斗争展览馆，更大规模地开展学习大寨的群众运动，“英雄”有了用武之地。一个远离县城的山沟小村庄，祖祖辈辈没有读书人，解放后，培养了一个高小毕业生，又调到公社当了干部，贫下中农学习毛主席著作都要到公社去请干部来帮助。这次，贫下中农指名点“将”，把那个高小毕业生要了回来。他回到老家，一边参加劳动，一边组织贫下中农办毛泽东思想学习班，贫下中农高兴地说：“毛主席最关心我们贫下中农，下放干部最合我们的心意。”凤阳公社有个水利工程拖了两年多没有建成，下放人员一到，就和贫下中农一起学大寨，抓阶级斗争，以革命带动生产，不到两个月，这个水库就修好了。这批人员还协助贫下中农开展教育革命，办起了二百七十一所小学，八十二所初中，十二所高中。现在，全县农村基本做到了读小学不离生产队，读初中不离大队，读高中不离公社，普及了农村教育。城里的“皮鞋医生”改造成了“赤脚医生”，并为农村培训了一百多名“赤脚医生”，贫下中农多年渴望的队队有医生的愿望，正在逐步实现。
    干部到农村安家落户，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎。有的生产队派代表驻县争着要下放干部，有的写信、打电话问下放干部什么时间下队。许多社、队的贫下中农象办喜事一样，成群结队，敲锣打鼓，有的还开了拖拉机，赶了几十里路来迎接。他们说：“干部下放，贫下中农最欢迎，阶级敌人最害怕。”他们亲切地说：“新社员来了”，热情帮助“新社员”把房屋打扫干净，还主动送上劳动工具。机关干部下农村安家落户，还改变了群众对机关和干部的看法，在社会上也产生了巨大的影响。贫下中农说：“过去干部往上调，青年往外跑，姑娘往外嫁。现在干部往农村放，青年往农村走，家往农村搬。城里人下乡当农民，风气变了！”在下放干部的影响下，全县有三百多城镇居民、闲散劳力，陆续迁到农村，参加社会主义建设。
    分宜县革委会把下放干部作为联系群众的渠道之一，定期组织他们举办毛泽东思想学习班，反映群众的意见、要求和呼声，促进机关的革命化，改进革委会的工作。同时确定实行机关干部“轮换制”。即县、社在职干部，包括领导干部，有计划地分期分批和下到农村安家落户的干部轮换，培养干部能上能下、能“官”能民，保证机关永远充满革命的朝气。
    江西省革命委员会最近在分宜召开现场会议，总结推广了他们组织干部下农村安家落户的经验。会议认为，组织干部、革命师生、医务人员到农村安家落户，在三大革命运动中接受贫下中农的再教育，为改革不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑提供了新的经验，是反修防修的百年大计，具有加速消灭三大差别的深远意义。同时，很好地体现了毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略思想。现在，江西省省级机关和各专、市、县正在纷纷组织干部、革命师生和医务人员下农村，自觉接受工农兵再教育。随着数十万下放人员开赴农村，不要很长的时间，江西省将会发生令人鼓舞的巨大变化。
