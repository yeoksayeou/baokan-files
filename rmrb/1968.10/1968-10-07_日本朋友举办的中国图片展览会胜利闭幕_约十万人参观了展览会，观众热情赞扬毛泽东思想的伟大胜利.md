Tokyo: The Yamaguchi Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and the Japan Foreign Trade Promotion Association held a "People's Republic of China Photographic Exhibition" to celebrate the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China (excluding Taiwan Province). The exhibition concluded successfully on September 29.

During the nine days of the exhibition, visitors were very enthusiastic, with approximately 100,000 people attending. This demonstrated the strong desire of the broad masses of the Japanese people to befriend the Chinese people and their enthusiastic concern for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The exhibition received high praise from the visitors. A staff member of the exhibition said that this exhibition was a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Every day, the venue was filled with scenes of visitors gathering to study Mao Zedong Thought.

Japanese electric worker Masaki Takeo said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has mobilized hundreds of millions of Chinese people to thoroughly smash the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, preventing capitalist restoration in socialist China, and further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. The victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only a victory for the Chinese people but also a victory for the Japanese people and the people of the world." This electric worker enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's important inscription to Japanese workers: "As long as one seriously achieves the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt."

He said, "Chairman Mao's important inscription points the way to the victory of the Japanese people's revolution, which is a great help to us Japanese people. We sincerely love Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought belongs not only to the Chinese people but to all revolutionary people of the world."

Young worker Kono, who has been actively participating in the struggle against U.S. military bases, said, "We Japanese workers are very concerned about China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly encouraged us Japanese workers and increased our confidence in advancing the cause of the Japanese people's liberation."

Kono said, "Now, U.S. imperialism is occupying Japan, setting up military bases, and running rampant everywhere. It is also colluding with the Japanese reactionaries to exploit us Japanese workers. We harbor deep hatred for U.S. imperialism. We must launch a struggle to drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan and out of Asia."

Kono said, "Mao Zedong Thought is our weapon for struggle. We must strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely achieve victory."

    日本朋友举办的中国图片展览会胜利闭幕
    约十万人参观了展览会，观众热情赞扬毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    新华社讯　东京消息：日中友好协会（正统）山口县总部和日本国际贸易促进会，为庆祝中国全国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）革命委员会全部成立而举办的“中华人民共和国图片展览会”，九月二十九日胜利闭幕。
    在展览会举行的九天中，观众十分踊跃，约有十万人参观了展出。这表达了广大日本人民要求同中国人民友好的强烈愿望，表达了他们对中国无产阶级文化大革命的热情关怀。
    这次展览会受到观众们的热烈赞扬。展览会的一位工作人员说，这次展览会，是毛泽东思想的大学校。连日来，会场上到处可以看到，观众聚拢在一起学习毛泽东思想的动人场景。
    日本电气工人真崎武夫说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命把亿万中国人民发动起来，彻底打垮了钻进共产党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，防止了在社会主义中国出现资本主义复辟，进一步巩固了无产阶级专政。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，不仅是中国人民的胜利，也是我们日本人民和世界人民的胜利。这位电气工人热烈赞扬毛主席书赠日本工人的重要题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”
    他说，毛主席的重要题词，给日本人民的革命胜利指出了方向，这对我们日本人民是一个巨大援助。我们衷心热爱毛主席。毛泽东思想不仅属于中国人民，而且属于全世界革命人民。
    坚持参加反对美国军事基地斗争的青年工人河野说，我们日本工人对中国无产阶级文化大革命非常关心。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，给我们日本工人带来了巨大鼓舞，增加了我们推进日本人民解放事业的信心。
    河野说，现在，美帝国主义霸占着日本，在日本设立军事基地，到处横行霸道，并且同日本反动派勾结起来压榨我们日本工人。我们对美帝国主义怀有深仇大恨。我们必须掀起斗争，从日本，从亚洲，把美帝国主义赶出去。
    河野说，毛泽东思想，是我们进行斗争的法宝。我们必须努力学习毛泽东思想。只要我们用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，我们就一定能取得胜利。
