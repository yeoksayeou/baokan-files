Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established in all eleven prefectures (autonomous regions) and 82 counties and cities in Gansu Province. Ninety-nine percent of the province's industrial and mining enterprises and rural people's communes have also established revolutionary committees. Currently, the revolutionary people of the entire province, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at various levels, are further comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and earnestly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire province is excellent.

A ship needs a helmsman to navigate the seas, and revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. Since the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee in January, it has always placed leading the broad masses of the people in earnestly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the forefront of all work. Under the leadership of the working class, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the province have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting the mass movement of earnestly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. To date, the province has held 595,000 classes of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 15 million participants. Since this year, from factories to villages, from cities to pastoral areas, from government offices to schools, from family courtyards to fields, everywhere is a classroom for earnestly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, everywhere is a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and everywhere is a focus on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought and the rapid implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions have powerfully struck down the handful of class enemies who attempted to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, promoted revolutionary unity, and laid a good foundation for the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels, developing the excellent revolutionary and production situation in the province.

The revolutionary criticism in various parts of the province is being carried out vigorously. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary masses are, with an irresistible momentum, destroying the old world of the bourgeoisie and cleansing the filth left over from old society. Since the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, in the Lanzhou area alone, more than 350 large-scale criticism meetings have been held against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Gansu, with over 1.99 million revolutionary masses participating. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses have further heightened their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, and their spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes.

Since this year, industrial production in Gansu Province has made rapid progress. The total industrial output value from January to August has continued to increase significantly, with more than 50 major products increasing in production month by month, and product quality improving step by step. On the agricultural front, after the summer harvest, the province has overcome natural disasters such as drought and hail, and most areas have good crop growth, with a bumper harvest in sight.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Gansu, and all "three-in-one" and "two-army" personnel, have resolutely responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the broad leftist masses," armed the masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically introduced the experience of the People's Liberation Army in earnestly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, actively helped the revolutionary masses implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and made great contributions to the Cultural Revolution in Gansu Province.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work must be fully brought into play." Under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, large numbers of working-class Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have entered schools and units that have not done a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Currently, under the leadership of the working class, the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement is surging forward on every front in the province.

    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示指引下
    甘肃各专区市县全部成立革委会
    全省革命和生产形势大好，广大革命人民正在各级革委会领导下认真搞好斗批改
    据新华社兰州电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，甘肃省十一个专区（自治州）和八十二个县、市全部成立了革命委员会。全省百分之九十九的工矿企业和农村人民公社，也都成立了革命委员会。目前，全省革命人民在各级革委会领导下，正在进一步全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真进行斗、批、改。全省革命和生产形势一派大好。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。甘肃省革命委员会在今年一月成立后，始终把带领广大人民群众，活学活用毛泽东思想，落实毛主席一系列最新指示，放在一切工作的首位。在工人阶级的领导下，全省各族革命人民大办毛泽东思想学习班，推动了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动深入开展。到目前为止，全省各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班已经举办了五十九万五千多期，参加学习的达一千五百多万人次。今年以来，全省从工厂到农村，从城市到牧区，从机关到学校，从家庭院落到田间地头，到处都是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，到处都是斗私批修的战场，到处都狠抓落实毛主席的最新指示。毛泽东思想的大普及和毛主席一系列最新指示的迅速落实，有力地打击了妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的一小撮阶级敌人，推动了革命的大联合，为建立各级革命委员会打下了良好基础，发展了全省的革命和生产的大好形势。
    全省各地的革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈。广大革命群众沿着毛主席指引的胜利航向，正以摧枯拉朽之势，摧毁资产阶级的旧世界，荡涤旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水。从省革委会成立以来，仅兰州地区对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在甘肃的代理人举行的大型批判会就达三百五十多场，参加批判的革命群众有一百九十九万多人次。通过革命大批判，广大革命群众进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，人的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    今年以来，甘肃省工业生产突飞猛进，一至八月份工业总产值持续大幅度增长，有五十多种主要产品的产量月月上升，产品质量步步提高。农业战线上，全省继夏粮获得丰收之后，又战胜了干旱、冰雹等自然灾害，大部分地区秋田长势良好，丰收在望。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”驻甘肃的人民解放军广大指战员和全体“三支”“两军”人员，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装群众，热情地介绍解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验，积极帮助革命群众落实毛主席一系列最新指示，对甘肃省的文化大革命作出了巨大的贡献。
    毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，在省革委会的领导下，全省大批工人毛泽东思想宣传队已开进学校和没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。目前，在工人阶级领导下，全省斗、批、改高潮正在条条战线蓬勃兴起。
