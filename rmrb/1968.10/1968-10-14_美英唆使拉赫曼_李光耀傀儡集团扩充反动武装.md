Since the US and UK imperialists manufactured the neocolonialist tool "Malaysia" in 1963, the Rahman puppet regime has followed its masters' orders to actively expand its reactionary military. It is revealed that from 1964 to 1967, in just four years, the regular army of the Rahman puppet regime increased from 22,000 to over 33,000 people, and the police field units increased to 24 companies, totaling 23,000 people.

The Li Kuan Yew puppet regime in Singapore has also been actively using compulsory conscription to establish reactionary armed forces in recent years. According to the instructions of US and UK imperialism, it has hired Israeli officers to establish a reactionary army of 2,000 people.

The Rahman-Li Kuan Yew puppet regime's actions of expanding reactionary military forces are being carried out with the direct support of US and UK imperialism. In early 1967, US imperialism, under the guise of "aid," provided the Rahman puppet regime with a loan of 57 million Malaysian dollars to purchase US military equipment.

    美英唆使拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团扩充反动武装
    自从美英帝国主义在一九六三年炮制新殖民主义工具“马来西亚”以来，拉赫曼傀儡集团就秉承它的主子的意旨，积极扩充反动军队。据透露，仅在一九六四年到一九六七年的四年间，拉赫曼傀儡集团的正规军就从二万二千人增加到三万三千多人，警察野战队增加到了二十四个连，共二万三千人。
    李光耀傀儡集团近几年也积极在新加坡使用强迫征兵的办法建立反动武装。它按照美英帝国主义的意旨，雇用以色列军官建立了一支拥有二千人的反动军队。
    拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团扩充反动军队的行径是在美英帝国主义的直接支持下进行的。一九六七年初，美帝国主义就以“援助”为名，给拉赫曼傀儡集团五千七百万元（马来亚币）的贷款，作为购买美国军事设备之用。
