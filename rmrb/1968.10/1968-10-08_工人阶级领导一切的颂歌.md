	Ode to the Worker Class Leading Everything
	Beijing Yongding Machinery Factory Workers Zhang Baosheng and Chang Zhensheng

	Watching "The Harbor," Learning from Heroes,
	The worker class has the reddest heart,
	Leading everything with a heroic spirit,
	Forever following the great leader Mao Zedong.

	The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." The revolutionary model opera—revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Harbor," personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, successfully portrays the heroic image of the working class with strong political content and perfect artistic form, vividly expressing the brilliant idea that "the working class is the leading class." Through the heroic images of Party branch secretary Fang Haizhen, loading team leader Gao Zhiyang, and old worker Ma Hongliang, among others, it passionately praises the working class's loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with their red hearts; it expresses the working class's patriotism and internationalist revolutionary spirit of cherishing the motherland and looking at the world; it conveys the determination of the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything and forever lead everything, to "change the world." The heroic figures of the working class portrayed in "The Harbor" are representatives of countless heroic figures of the working class nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and are a true reflection of the Chinese working class in the socialist era. The heroic figures on stage remind us of the struggles off stage, making us feel more intimate and excited the more we watch. It seems we are not in the theater but on the dock, fighting side by side with the heroes.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won the revolution should support the struggle of the people who are still fighting for liberation." The heroic dock workers in "The Harbor," following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions, regard supporting the world's revolutionary people as their sacred internationalist duty. They stand on the dock and see that "revolutionary winds are sweeping the world, awakened people look up to Beijing; Mao Zedong Thought's east wind is spreading, the battle cry resounds across the five continents." They think of "Shanghai Harbor connecting the south and north, vast plains and palm groves, supporting domestic construction and the people of the world!" Because they have this great ambition of the working class leading everything with their "strong hands holding the seal of revolution," and this broad-mindedness of "for the revolution, even if mountains and seas block the way, we must deliver this deep affection to all four directions," they can "trample the mountains to make the path flat," strive for progress, forge ahead, and overcome all difficulties.

	"The dock workers' spirit is like steel." The heroic figures of the working class, Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang, under Chairman Mao's guidance to "serve all the people of China and the world," with fiery passion and selfless labor, support the world revolution, expressing the Chinese working class's thorough revolutionary spirit to liberate all humanity. They deeply understand that "the work of a loader has profound significance," "one package, one item, connected to the world's winds and clouds." After the small wheat bag scattering incident, they think of "the barge loaded with the honor of the motherland, it cannot let the scattered bags be covered with dust. The barge is loaded with revolutionary friendship, how can the scattered bags leave stains." The high sense of political responsibility and the noble thought of the working class leading everything make them determined to find the cause of the scattering. Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang lead the entire team of workers with the heroic spirit of "steel shoulders and iron arms tempered by a hundred trials, fearing not the mountain of wheat bags." They search the warehouse all night, checking each of the two thousand bags of wheat. Later, when it was found that the scattered wheat had already been loaded onto the barge as rice and was heading to Wusong, loading team leader Gao Zhiyang, thinking of the honor of the motherland and the responsibility of the world revolution, braves the "thunderous rain and surging tides," drives the motorboat, and ventures out to sea. That revolutionary heroic spirit of "knowing the dangers of the surging waves, yet daring to sail on the stormy river" fully demonstrates the Chinese working class's fearless, invincible revolutionary demeanor.

	The working class leads everything with Mao Zedong Thought. The Party branch secretary Fang Haizhen in "The Harbor," this old worker from the old society, is a good example of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. She remembers Chairman Mao's great instruction to "never forget class struggle" and always uses the perspective of class and class struggle to analyze and solve problems. When Han Xiaqiang's transfer request and the scattered wheat incident occurred, she first thought of "in victory, one must keep a clear head, and there is class struggle on the road ahead." She, with her keen and sharp eyes, saw through the reactionary nature of the warehouse keeper Qian Shouwei who was retained, mobilized the masses, and gave him a head-on blow. She used the living textbook of class struggle to educate Han Xiaqiang, armed him with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, making him recognize and correct his mistakes. Fang Haizhen, this good cadre of Chairman Mao and good representative of the working class, sets a shining example for us. The working class leading everything is to use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, guide everything, and arm everything.

	The historical trend of the working class occupying all positions and leading everything is unstoppable by any force. However, the arch-enemy of the working class, the Chinese Khrushchev, always tries to use his "granite" head to block the progress of the historical wheel. He stubbornly stands on the reactionary bourgeois position, using every means to smear the working class and maliciously defame and slander the working class. During the creation of "The Harbor," this old scoundrel had a disgusting performance. After watching the performance of the Huiju opera "Morning at the Harbor," he maliciously slandered the working class as a "mob that would not rely on a lever to get more or embezzle relief funds." The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who controlled the literary and artistic circles, like flies following stench, buzzed behind the Chinese Khrushchev, saying nonsense like "workers on stage, hard to sing, hard to dance." They fiercely opposed the working class "taking the stage," opposed the working class "speaking," opposed the working class "raising their hands," which is extremely detestable! "Ants shaking a tree, how easy can it be?" Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, engaged in a head-on struggle with the Chinese Khrushchev clique, smashed the conspiracies of this handful of class enemies, and led revolutionary literary and artistic workers to successfully create "The Harbor." The heroic figures of the working class stand proudly on the stage, "singing" the resounding praise of "Mao Zedong Thought shining brightly," "raising their hands" to hold up the revolutionary "lever," smashing the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk to smithereens!

	The working class takes the stage, and the ghosts and monsters roll down. The birth of the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Harbor" is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! It is the fruitful result of Comrade Jiang Qing's heroic struggle! It is a great victory of the working class leading everything! The spirit of "the working class must lead everything" shown in "The Harbor" will forever inspire us to march forward with high spirits. Chairman Mao waves his hand, and we advance. The working class will forever be the locomotive of the revolution. We must, like the heroic workers of "The Harbor," strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, "continually raise our political awareness in struggle," and "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform." We will forever follow Chairman Mao, grasp the revolution and promote production on the battlefield, contributing all our strength to building socialism and supporting the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist struggle of the world's revolutionary people!

    工人阶级领导一切的颂歌
    北京永定机械厂工人　张宝申　常振声
    看《海港》，学英雄，
    工人阶级心最红，
    领导一切志豪迈，
    永跟统帅毛泽东。
    伟大的领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”由江青同志亲手培育的革命样板戏——革命现代京剧《海港》，以强烈的政治内容和完美的艺术形式，成功地塑造了工人阶级的英雄群像，形象地表现了“工人阶级是领导阶级”这一光辉思想。戏中通过党支部书记方海珍、装卸组长高志扬、老工人马洪亮等一系列英雄的码头工人的高大形象，热情地歌颂了工人阶级最忠于毛主席、最忠于毛泽东思想、最忠于毛主席革命路线的赤胆红心；抒发了工人阶级胸怀祖国、放眼世界的爱国主义和国际主义革命豪情；表达了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，就是要领导一切，永远领导一切，“定叫世界变个样”的雄心壮志。《海港》里塑造的这些叱咤风云的工人阶级英雄人物，是在毛泽东思想的哺育下千千万万个工人阶级英雄人物的代表，是社会主义时代中国工人阶级的真实写照。看台上的英雄人物，想台下的斗争生活，真是越看越亲切，越看越激动。我们仿佛不是在剧场，而是在码头上和英雄们并肩战斗。
    毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争”。《海港》中英雄的码头工人，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把支援世界革命人民作为自己的神圣的国际主义义务。他们立足海港，看到的是“全世界闹革命风起云涌，觉醒的人民仰望北京；毛泽东思想东风传送，五大洲响彻了进军号声。”他们想到的是“上海港紧连着江南塞北、莽原椰林，支援那国内建设、世界人民！”正因为他们有这种用“粗大的手，把革命大印来执掌”的工人阶级领导一切的伟大气魄，有这种“为革命，哪怕山高海阔来阻挡，定要把这深情厚谊，送往那四面八方”的宽广胸怀，所以他们就能够“山头踩出平坦路”，奋发图强，勇往直前，战胜一切困难。
    “码头工人志如钢”。方海珍、高志扬等高大的工人阶级英雄人物，在毛主席要“为全中国人民和全世界人民服务”的教导下，以火热的激情，忘我的劳动，支援世界革命，表达了中国工人阶级要解放全人类的彻底革命精神。他们深深懂得“装卸工这工作意义深长”，“一包一件，紧连着世界风云”。在发生了小麦散包事故后，他们想到的是“那驳船满载着祖国荣誉，决不能让散包撒上灰尘。那驳船装的是革命情谊，怎能够让散包留下污痕。”高度的政治责任感和工人阶级要领导好一切的崇高思想，使他们下定决心，一定要查出散包。方海珍、高志扬率领全组工人以“钢肩铁臂经百炼，那怕麦包堆如山”的气壮山河的英雄气概，连夜翻仓，把两千包小麦逐一查清。后来，发现散包小麦已错当大米上了驳船开往吴淞时，装卸组长高志扬想到祖国的荣誉和世界革命的责任，不顾“雷吼阵雨猛，潮涌夜深沉”，驾驶汽艇，冒险出海，那种“明知惊涛骇浪险，偏向风波江上行”的革命英雄气概，充分展示了中国工人阶级天不怕、地不怕，无往而不胜的革命风貌。
    工人阶级领导一切，靠的是毛泽东思想。《海港》中的党支部书记方海珍，这个从旧社会过来的老工人，就是活学活用毛泽东思想的好榜样。她牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，时时用阶级和阶级斗争的观点去分析问题，解决问题。当韩小强的请调信和散包小麦事故出现的时候，她首先想到了“胜利中须保持头脑清醒，征途上处处有阶级斗争。”她以明察秋毫的锐利目光，看穿了留用仓库保管员钱守维的反动本质，发动群众，给予迎头痛击。她用阶级斗争的活教材教育了韩小强，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了韩小强，使他认识和改正了错误。方海珍这个毛主席的好干部、工人阶级的好代表，为我们树立了光辉的榜样。我们工人阶级要领导一切，就是要用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，武装一切。
    工人阶级要占领一切阵地，工人阶级必须领导一切，这个历史的总趋势是任何势力也阻挡不住的。可是中国赫鲁晓夫这个工人阶级的死对头，却总想用他那“花冈岩”脑袋去阻挡历史车轮的前进。他顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，千方百计地往工人阶级脸上抹黑，恶毒地丑化和污蔑工人阶级。在《海港》的创作过程中，这个老工贼就有过一番丑恶的表演。在他看了淮剧《海港的早晨》演出以后，大肆污蔑工人阶级是什么“如不凭杠棒就要多领、冒领救济款”的“群氓”。把持文艺界大权的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，也象苍蝇逐臭一样，跟在中国赫鲁晓夫的屁股后边嗡嗡乱叫，他们胡说什么“工人上台，张口难唱，抬手难舞”。他们就是这样歇斯底里地反对工人阶级“上台”，反对工人阶级“张口”，反对工人阶级“抬手”，真是可恶之极！“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”。我们敬爱的江青同志，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫一伙进行了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了这一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，率领革命文艺工作者成功地创作了《海港》。工人阶级的英雄人物巍然屹立在舞台上，“张口”高唱“毛泽东思想放光芒”的响亮赞歌，“抬手”高举革命的“杠棒”，把中国赫鲁晓夫之流砸了个稀巴烂！
    工人阶级登舞台，牛鬼蛇神滚下来。革命现代京剧《海港》的诞生，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是江青同志英勇战斗的丰硕成果！是工人阶级领导一切的伟大胜利！《海港》中显示出的“工人阶级必须领导一切”的豪情壮志，将永远鼓舞着我们高歌猛进。毛主席挥手我前进，工人阶级永作革命的火车头。我们一定要象英雄的《海港》工人一样，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，“在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”，“认真搞好斗、批、改”。我们永远跟着毛主席，在战斗的岗位上狠抓革命，猛促生产，为建设社会主义，为支援世界革命人民的反帝反修斗争，贡献出一切力量！
