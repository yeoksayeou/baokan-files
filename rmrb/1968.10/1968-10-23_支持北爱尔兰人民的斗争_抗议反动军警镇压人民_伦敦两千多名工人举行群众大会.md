London: More than 2,000 workers held a mass rally on October 20 to support the struggle of the people of Northern Ireland for democratic rights and to protest against the suppression of the people by reactionary military and police forces.

The demonstrators chanted slogans as they marched from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square for a rally.

Speakers at the rally strongly condemned the reactionary rule of the Northern Ireland authorities and their brutal suppression of the people. They also angrily protested the Wilson government's support for the Northern Ireland authorities.

Northern Ireland is the poorest place in Britain. For many years, the British reactionary ruling clique has carried out national and religious oppression there, causing increasing discontent among the people. On October 5, in the second-largest city of Northern Ireland, Derry, the people rose up to fight for democratic rights. They bravely battled the reactionary police who came to suppress them. On October 19, about 3,000 people held a demonstration in the city.

    新华社伦敦二十日电　伦敦两千多名工人二十日举行群众大会，支持北爱尔兰人民争取民主权利的斗争，并抗议反动军警镇压人民。
    示威者高呼口号从海德公园游行到特拉法加广场举行集会。
    会上的发言者强烈谴责北爱尔兰当局的反动统治和对人民的残酷镇压。他们还愤怒抗议威尔逊政府对北爱尔兰当局的支持。
    北爱尔兰是英国最穷苦的地方，多年来英国反动统治集团在那里实行民族和宗教压迫，引起人民愈来愈强烈的不满。十月五日，在北爱尔兰第二大城市德里，人民群众掀起了争取民主权利的斗争，他们和前去镇压的反动警察展开了英勇的搏斗。十九日，该市又有约三千人举行了示威。
