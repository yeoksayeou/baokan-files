An unprecedented struggle storm is shaking the backyard of U.S. imperialism. The struggle of Mexican students against persecution is raging fiercely. Students fearlessly confront the machine-gun fire of reactionary military police, using Molotov cocktails and other weapons to bravely fight back. The struggle of students in Mexico City has gained widespread support from workers and students across the country.

	New China News Agency, October 4th: A message from Mexico City reports that over ten thousand students in the Mexican capital, Mexico City, held a large-scale demonstration in the Tlatelolco district on the evening of the 2nd. They strongly protested the reactionary military police's occupation of schools and brutal suppression of the student movement, demanding the dissolution of the riot police that oppress the people, the abolition of laws that suppress people's movements, the release of arrested students, and the withdrawal of troops from all schools that have been illegally occupied by the military.

	Under the immense pressure of the student movement, the Mexican authorities had previously been forced to order the withdrawal of troops from the National Autonomous University of Mexico a few days ago. However, they continued to occupy many institutions such as the National Polytechnic Institute and continued to suppress the student movement. When students held a demonstration on the evening of the 2nd to reiterate their legitimate demands made recently, they were once again surrounded and brutally suppressed by the riot police and a large number of armed forces. According to reports, reactionary military police, supported by helicopters and armored vehicles, opened fire with machine guns on the demonstrating students, killing many on the spot. However, the brave Mexican youth stood their ground, using stones, clubs, Molotov cocktails, and other weapons to fight back fiercely, engaging in several hours of tenacious struggle with the reactionary military police.

	According to reports, earlier, about fifteen thousand university students and their parents from Mexico City held a demonstration on September 30th, demanding the immediate release of illegally arrested students. At a meeting held by the students of the National Autonomous University of Mexico on the evening of the 1st, a student leader called on university students to take to the streets, "continue the fight until victory."

	The just struggle of students in Mexico City is gaining more extensive sympathy and support from students and workers across the country. According to reports, students in cities such as Monterrey and Veracruz recently held demonstrations and marches, protesting the suppression of reactionary military police and supporting the just struggle of students in the capital. Some railway workers and electric power workers in Mexico also expressed their support for the students' struggle.

	New China News Agency, October 5th: A message from Mexico City reports that in the heavily guarded Mexican capital, Mexico City, brave and unyielding students held multiple meetings on the afternoon of the 4th to angrily protest the bloody massacre of students by reactionary military police on the evening of the 2nd. Students wrote on the Monument to the Revolution in the city center, "We will not rest until we achieve victory," expressing their determination to fight to the end.

	Meanwhile, students in various states continued to hold demonstrations and other activities, strongly protesting the suppression of reactionary military police and supporting the just struggle of students in Mexico City. Over two thousand students and representatives of university staff in Monterrey, Mexico's third-largest city, held a meeting on the 4th to protest the violent suppression of students by the military police authorities. These students also occupied many buildings in Monterrey University. According to reports, students are preparing to organize propaganda teams to explain the purpose of the student struggle to the public. In cities such as Aguascalientes, Puebla, and Cuernavaca, students also held protest demonstrations. Students in Durango held a strike to protest the atrocities of the military police.

    在学生运动的强大压力下，墨西哥当局几天前曾被迫下令从国立墨西哥大学撤退了军队，但是却继续强占着工艺学校等许多院校，继续镇压学生运动。当二日晚学生们举行示威集会重申他们不久前提出的正当要求时，竟然又一次遭到“防暴队”和大批武装部队的包围和血腥镇压。据报道，有直升飞机和装甲车配合的反动军警用机关枪向示威学生扫射，许多学生当场被打死。但是，英勇的墨西哥青年学生临危不惧，用石头、木棍、汽油弹等作武器，英勇反击，同反动军警进行了好几个小时的顽强搏斗。
    据报道，在这以前，由墨西哥城的大学生和他们的家长约一万五千多人在九月三十日举行了示威游行，要求当局立即释放被非法逮捕的学生。在墨西哥大学学生一日晚举行的集会上，一位学生领导人号召大学生们走上街头，“继续投入战斗，直到胜利为止”。
    墨西哥城的学生的正义斗争，正在得到全国各地学生和工人的更广泛同情和支持。据报道，在蒙特雷和维拉克鲁斯等城市的学生最近都举行了游行示威，抗议反动军警的镇压暴行，声援首都学生的正义斗争。墨西哥的一些铁路工人和电力工人也表示支持学生的斗争。

    同时，内地各州的学生继续举行示威等活动，强烈抗议反动军警的镇压暴行，声援墨西哥城学生的正义斗争。墨西哥第三大城市蒙特雷的两千多名学生和大学职员的代表四日举行集会，抗议军警当局对学生的暴力镇压。这些学生还占领了蒙特雷大学的许多大楼。据报道，学生们准备组织宣传队，向群众解释学生斗争的目的。在阿瓜斯卡连特斯、普埃布拉和奎尔纳瓦卡等城市，学生们也举行了抗议示威。杜兰戈城的学生举行了抗议军警暴行的罢课。
