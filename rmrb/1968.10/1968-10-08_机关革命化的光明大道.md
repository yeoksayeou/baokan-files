Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "A large number of cadres should go down to the countryside to labor, this is an excellent opportunity for cadres to re-learn. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." We have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, discussed our experiences from a year of participating in labor, and deeply felt that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are extremely wise and correct, pointing out the most brilliant path for institutions to achieve revolutionization and for cadres to forever maintain revolutionary youthfulness.

In January of this year, after the commune revolutionary committee was established, we followed Chairman Mao's great teachings of "must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor." Except for one member and cadre who take turns to handle daily work, all other cadres went to the production teams to participate in long-term collective production labor, and at the same time, we directly led the production teams. By doing so, the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary committee members and institutional cadres has been greatly strengthened.

Our revolutionary committee members include old cadres and new cadres; some are older, and some are younger. We all feel that for any cadre, insisting on participating in labor is the fundamental way to overcome bureaucratic tendencies, to closely connect with the masses, and to forever maintain revolutionary youthfulness. In the past, the old commune institutions were influenced by the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and the leading cadres and institutional cadres were long detached from labor, "riding in cars to inspect situations, using telephones to report back," cultivating a bourgeois bureaucratic tendency, living in a special way, acting subjectively, being cold to the masses, and the gap in thought and emotion with the poor and lower-middle peasants became wider and wider. After the revolutionary committee was established, we insisted on the labor system, overcame the bureaucratic tendencies of the old commune institutions, and closely connected with the masses. The chairman of the revolutionary committee, Yang Fengyuan, was originally the deputy secretary of the commune party committee. In the past, because he was long detached from labor, his airs became bigger and bigger, and his official demeanor became more and more pronounced. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Comrade Yang, so majestic, so much airs, so cold a face, when the poor and lower-middle peasants ask a question, he answers with his nose." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through the education of the masses, his soul was touched, and his political and ideological awareness was somewhat improved. In over nine months of production labor, he rolled up his trousers, unbuttoned his shirt, and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants, knocking down his official airs. Yang Fengyuan is from a family of poor peasants, and at the age of thirteen, he started working for the landlord, plowing the fields and herding cattle, experiencing hardships. Labor made him recall his bitter past, realizing that he was born and raised by poor peasants, and as a cadre, he should serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. From then on, he was covered in dust on sunny days and mud on rainy days, his face tanned black, his hands calloused, and his heart closely connected with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants used to call him "Comrade Yang," after the revolutionary committee was established, they called him "Chairman Yang," and now they call him "Old Yang," saying: "Old Yang goes to the fields, running in the wind and rain, no airs at all, heart to heart with us, is a good servant of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Insisting on production labor has tempered the youth. The original commune institution had some "three-door" cadres, who, due to a lack of tempering and testing in class struggle and production struggle, thought that the rural commune was poor and barren, not a place to display their talents, and were not content with their work. After directly participating in class struggle and production struggle, their ideological awareness has greatly improved. The revolutionary committee member and original commune youth league secretary, Bai Yushan, is a "three-door" cadre. In the past, because he was detached from class struggle and production struggle, his bourgeois ideology was not well reformed, often saying: "Being a commune cadre, little money, many things; little power, big responsibility, nothing to do." After the revolutionary committee was established, he went to the mountainous area of the Workers and Peasants Brigade to labor. During labor, Bai Yushan saw the deep class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants for Chairman Mao and their great aspirations to change the world, receiving profound education. He decided to take root in the mountain valley. Later, he lived in a poor peasant's house, working day and night with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and his ideological awareness greatly improved. Later, the revolutionary committee let him directly handle the work of purging the class ranks. In the complex class struggle, he always stood firm, with clear banners, acted according to the party's policies, and achieved great results.

Insisting on participating in labor has enabled many new cadres who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to maintain the noble qualities of diligence, simplicity, and wholeheartedly serving the people. Poor peasant Zhang Qingchun, before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a good commune member who insisted on the socialist road, a firm proletarian revolutionary during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and when the commune revolutionary committee was established, he was elected by the poor and lower-middle peasants as a member of the revolutionary committee, and later he successively served as a member of the Changchun City Revolutionary Committee and the chairman of the Changchun City Farmers' Representative Assembly. His position became higher and higher, but his thought of serving the people never changed, and he still insisted on participating in production labor. When the city revolutionary committee held a meeting and sent a car to pick him up, he did not take it, walking over sixty miles to the city. Whenever he had time, he went to the team to participate in labor, always the same as the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants all said he was: "A people's cadre with calloused hands, a city committee member with muddy legs, carrying a hoe to the office, handling public affairs in the fields."

Through participating in production labor, we have increasingly deeply felt that whether or not we can insist on participating in labor is the fundamental difference between proletarian revolutionary cadres and bourgeois officials. Participating in labor can make us wash away the dust of old institutions and completely break with bureaucratic tendencies; it can make us closely connect with the masses and forever maintain the nature of laboring people; it can make us forever have high morale and maintain a hardworking and struggling work style. Cadres participating in labor is a long-term strategy for opposing revisionism and preventing revisionism. We will definitely resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

    机关革命化的光明大道
    吉林省长春市郊区农林公社革命委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”我们反复学习毛主席这一最新指示，畅谈一年来参加劳动的体会，深深感到毛主席这一最新指示无比英明，无比正确，指出了机关实现革命化、干部永葆革命青春的最光辉的道路。
    今年一月，公社革委会成立后，我们遵照毛主席“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度”的伟大教导，除轮流有一名委员和机关干部照顾日常工作外，其余干部全部到生产队去，长期坚持参加集体生产劳动，同时对生产队实行面对面的领导。这样做，使革委会成员和机关干部的思想革命化有了很大加强。
    我们革委会的成员中，有老干部，也有新干部；有年龄较大的，也有年龄轻的。我们都体会到，无论对于什么干部，坚持参加劳动是克服官僚主义作风，密切同群众的联系，永葆革命青春的根本途径。过去旧公社机关受中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的影响，领导干部和机关干部长期脱离劳动，“骑着车子看情况，拿着电话要汇报”，养成了一种资产阶级的官僚主义作风，生活特殊，办事主观，对群众冷淡，和贫下中农在思想感情上距离越来越大。革委会成立后，坚持了劳动制度，克服了旧公社机关的官僚主义作风，密切联系了群众。革委会主任杨凤元，原来是公社党委副书记。过去，由于他长期脱离劳动，架子越摆越大，官气越来越足，贫下中农说：“杨书记，真威风，架子大，面孔冷，贫下中农问句话，他用鼻子来答应。”在文化大革命运动中，经过群众的教育，触及了他的灵魂，政治思想觉悟有所提高。在九个多月的生产劳动中，他卷起裤脚，解开衣襟，和贫下中农一起干活，打掉了官架子。杨凤元是扛长工出身，十三岁就给地主扶大犁、放牛，受过苦。劳动使他记起了苦难的过去，认识到自己是贫农生、贫农养，当了干部就要为贫下中农服务。从此，他晴天一身土，雨天一身泥，脸晒黑了，手磨粗了，心和贫下中农贴得紧紧的。贫下中农过去喊他“杨书记”，革委会成立了喊他“杨主任”，现在一口一个“老杨”，都说：“老杨下田间，风里跑，雨里颠，一点架子也不见，和咱心连心，是贫下中农的好勤务员。”
    坚持生产劳动，使青年人得到了锻炼。原公社机关有一些“三门”干部，由于缺乏阶级斗争和生产斗争的锻炼和考验，有些人认为农村公社山穷水穷，不是用武之地，不安心工作。直接参加了阶级斗争和生产斗争以后，思想觉悟有了很大提高。革委会委员、原公社团委书记白玉山，是个“三门”干部，过去由于脱离阶级斗争和生产斗争，资产阶级思想一直没有得到很好的改造，常说：“当公社干部，钱不多，事不少；权力不大，责任不小，没啥干头。”革委会成立后，他来到山区的工农大队参加劳动。在劳动中，白玉山看到贫下中农对毛主席深厚的阶级感情，和改天换地的雄心壮志，受到了深刻的教育。他决心在山沟里扎根。以后，他住在一个贫农家里，和贫下中农一起黑夜白天地干，思想觉悟有很大提高。后来革委会让他直接抓清理阶级队伍的工作。在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，他始终立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，按党的政策办事，做出了很大成绩。
    坚持参加劳动，使很多在文化大革命中间涌现出来的新干部，保持了勤劳、朴实、全心全意为人民服务的高尚品质。贫农张青春，在文化大革命以前是个坚持走社会主义道路的好社员，文化大革命中是个坚定的无产阶级革命派，公社革委会成立时，他被贫下中农推选为革委会委员，后来又先后担任了长春市革委会委员，长春市农代会主任，职位越来越高，但是他为人民服务的思想却始终不变，仍然坚持参加生产劳动。市革委会开会派车来接他，他不坐，步行六十多里路走到市里。他一有时间就到队里参加劳动，始终和贫下中农一样。贫下中农都说他是：“人民干部满手茧，市里的委员两腿泥，扛着锄头去办公，公事办到地里。”
    通过参加生产劳动，我们越来越深刻地体会到，能不能坚持参加劳动，这是无产阶级革命干部和资产阶级官老爷的根本区别。参加劳动，能使我们洗去旧机关的灰尘，同官僚主义作风彻底决裂；能使我们密切联系群众，永远保持劳动人民的本色；能使我们永远斗志旺盛，保持艰苦奋斗的工作作风。干部参加劳动，是反修防修的百年大计。我们一定坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示。
