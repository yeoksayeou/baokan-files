Mao Zedong taught us: "Our nation has always had a spirit of hard struggle, and we must carry it forward." Enduring hardships and toiling tirelessly is the true character of proletarian heroes and a glorious tradition of our party. This spirit of hard struggle serves our party's political direction. It is the guarantee of our victory over all enemies and the overcoming of all difficulties.

The spirit of hard struggle is a major obstacle to the restoration of capitalism by the Chinese Khrushchev. Therefore, he distorts this glorious tradition and peddles a revisionist theory of "suffering," claiming that only by "enduring a little hardship" can one be "respected" and "trusted," and that this is the most worthwhile thing. He strips this glorious tradition of its political direction, making it serve his ambitions to seize the party, seize power, and restore capitalism.

Comrade Mao Zedong's good soldier and our old platoon leader, Comrade Lei Feng, endured great hardships and toiled tirelessly for the revolution, serving the people wholeheartedly. He set a brilliant example for us to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle. Lei Feng said: "For the freedom, happiness, and liberation of all mankind, for the cause of the party and the people, even if it means entering a sea of fire or climbing a mountain of knives, I am willing. Even if my head is cut off and my bones are broken, my heart will remain red and unchanging forever." These golden words are a sharp rebuke to the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "suffering."

In recent years, our platoon has carried on the spirit of Comrade Lei Feng, who considered suffering for the revolution a happiness. Comrades take on the heaviest burdens and the toughest tasks, rushing to where the hardships are. This was the case during construction work and also during the "Three Supports, Two Militaries." Last July, we switched from supporting agriculture to supporting industry. At that time, due to the sabotage of a handful of capitalist roaders, transportation was temporarily halted, and comrades walked over thirty miles to the factory every day to spread Mao Zedong Thought. Later, when transportation was restored, comrades insisted on walking for the convenience of others. At that time, comrades did not know what hardship and fatigue were, nor did they consider making themselves "respected" and "trusted." Everyone had only one belief: even if our heads are cut off and our blood flows, Mao Zedong's revolutionary line cannot be abandoned; even if we do not ride in cars or eat food, we must deliver Mao Zedong's voice to the hearts of the workers. We used such revolutionary actions to smash the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to corrupt party members with a bourgeois worldview.

Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters must definitely have vigor, a firm revolutionary will, and the spirit of overcoming any difficulty with unyielding determination. Only in this way can we struggle hard for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution all our lives.

    为革命艰苦奋斗一辈子
    “雷锋班”副班长　杨东顺
    毛主席教导我们：“我们民族历来有一种艰苦奋斗的作风，我们要把它发扬起来。”吃大苦，耐大劳，是无产阶级英雄本色，是我党的光荣传统。这种艰苦奋斗的工作作风是为我党的政治方向服务的。它是我们战胜一切敌人，克服一切困难的有力保证。
    艰苦奋斗的工作作风是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的一大障碍。所以，他竭力歪曲这一光荣传统，贩卖一套修正主义的“吃苦”论。说什么只有“吃点小苦”，才能被人“尊敬”“信任”，才是“最值得的”等等。他抽掉了这一光荣传统的政治方向，使之为他篡党、篡政、复辟资本主义的野心服务。
    毛主席的好战士、我们的老班长雷锋同志，一生为革命吃大苦耐大劳，全心全意为人民服务，为我们继承发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统树立了光辉榜样。雷锋说：“为了全人类的自由、幸福和解放，为党和人民的事业，就是入火海、上刀山，我也心甘情愿，断头碎骨，身红心赤，永远不变。”这些金光闪闪的语言给中国赫鲁晓夫的“吃苦”论迎头一棒。
    几年来，我们班把雷锋班长那种为革命吃苦就是幸福的共产主义思想接了过来。同志们拣重担子挑，拣重工作干，哪里艰苦奔向哪里。在施工时是这样，在“三支”“两军”中也是这样。去年七月，我们从支农转到支工，当时因一小撮走资派的破坏，交通暂停，同志们便每天步行三十多里到工厂去宣传毛泽东思想。后来交通恢复，同志们为了别人方便，坚持步行。当时，同志们根本不知道什么叫辛苦，什么叫劳累，也根本不考虑为了让人“尊敬”、“信任”。大家只有一个信念：头可断、血可流，毛主席的革命路线不可丢；车不坐、饭不吃，也要把毛主席的声音送到工人心坎里。我们就用这样的革命行动来粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫用资产阶级世界观腐蚀党员的阴谋。
    共产党员、革命战士“一定要有朝气，一定要有坚强的革命意志，一定要有不怕困难和用百折不挠的意志去克服任何困难的精神”，这样，才能为中国革命和世界革命艰苦奋斗一辈子。
