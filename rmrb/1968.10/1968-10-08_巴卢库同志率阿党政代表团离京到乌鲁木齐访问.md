Main streets in the city were decorated with arches and large welcome banners. The sky above the airport was adorned with the national flags of China and Albania, and giant portraits of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people.

The military and people of Xinjiang, who are fighting on the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist front, deeply admire the fearless revolutionary spirit and heroic demeanor of the Albanian people in defying the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. Shortly after the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in the great situation of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Baluku came to Xinjiang for a visit. This is a great encouragement and support for the 8 million people of Xinjiang and a powerful blow to the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

Vice Chairmen Wang Enmao, Pei Zhouyu, Li Quanchun, Yang Libing, Hu Liangcai, Ziya, and Wu Juleun of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, leaders of the Xinjiang Military Region, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 7335 Unit, including Tan Kaiyun, Cao Danuo, Kong Ruoyun, Li Jingshan, and Wang Xiangxiong, Mayor Huang Yu of Urumqi Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and representatives of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Five Good Soldiers of the PLA, military farmers, and Red Guards numbering in the thousands, went to the airport to warmly welcome the heroic messengers of the Albanian people.

The special plane carrying the Albanian comrades landed to the sound of drums and cheers. After Baluku and others disembarked, the welcoming crowd waved the national flags of China and Albania and the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting slogans: "Firmly Support Albania's Revolutionary Action of Withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact!" "Long Live Sino-Albanian Friendship!" They continuously shouted "Enver-Mao Zedong" and "Mao Zedong-Enver." Baluku and others frequently waved, greeting the welcoming crowd.

After the Albanian comrades entered the city, Baluku, accompanied by Wang Enmao and Wang Xinting, and Marko, accompanied by Pei Zhouyu and Qiao Guanhua, boarded open-top cars separately, accepting the enthusiastic welcome of the revolutionary people from various ethnic groups along the streets. As the cars carrying Baluku and others passed by, people cheered and danced, the streets were filled with the sound of drums and gongs, songs echoed, flowers flew, and everyone continuously shouted slogans: "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" "Down with Soviet Revisionism!" "Down with All Reactionaries!" "Celebrate the Great Victory of Albania's Revolutionary Movement!" "Long Live the Complete Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long Live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the Invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!"

Under the accompaniment of the exciting sound of hand drums and the pleasant sound of the hotwaqin, various ethnic revolutionary people dressed in colorful national costumes danced, expressing their enthusiastic welcome and combat greetings to the Albanian comrades who had come from afar.

New China News Agency, Urumqi, October 7th: The Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Military Region held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Baluku.

At the banquet filled with enthusiastic and friendly atmosphere, Vice Chairman and Political Commissar of the Xinjiang Military Region Wang Enmao and Comrade Baluku spoke successively.

In his speech, Comrade Wang Enmao, on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Military Region, and the 8 million people of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, extended the warmest welcome to the heroic messengers of the Albanian people. He praised the heroic Albanian people, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great Marxist-Leninist, and the Albanian Labor Party, for adhering to the Marxist-Leninist line, standing firm on the frontline of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism in Europe, and waging a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and the modern revisionist clique led by the Soviet revisionists. This has won the admiration of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

Comrade Wang Enmao said, Xinjiang is located on the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist frontline. The people of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the PLA stationed in Xinjiang, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, are always vigilant, strengthening war preparedness, consolidating the border defense, and defending the motherland. If the Soviet revisionists dare to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them.

Comrade Wang Enmao said, the two parties, the two countries, and the two armies of China and Albania are the closest comrades-in-arms. We must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, stand together with the heroic Albanian people and the Albanian people's army, fight together, and win together.

Comrade Baluku delivered a passionate speech. He highly praised the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great Comrade Mao Zedong, has enriched Marxism-Leninism and made great contributions to the proletarian revolutionary cause of the world. People of the world are learning from the experience of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Baluku also congratulated the people of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang on the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong and the great victory achieved in the Cultural Revolution.

He said, the revolutionary movement currently underway in Albania is also to prevent the restoration of capitalism and to smash the subversive plots of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. Although the enemy has suffered a humiliating defeat, they will still attempt to engage in subversive activities in China and Albania, and we must remain vigilant. If they dare to touch socialist Albania, they will be completely destroyed. China and Albania bear a great historical mission, and we must carry out the principled struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to the end.

He enthusiastically sang the praises of the deep friendship and iron-like unity between the two countries, the two parties, and the two armies of China and Albania. He said, no force in the world can destroy our combat friendship and rock-like unity.

Comrade Baluku said, today, the people of Urumqi have come out in full force to welcome us, showing the sincere feelings of the Chinese people towards our party, our people, and Comrade Hoxha. We will certainly convey this revolutionary deep affection to our party, our people, and our beloved great leader Comrade Hoxha. Here, I express my heartfelt thanks.

Vice Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Wang Xinting and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua, who accompanied the delegation to Urumqi, attended the banquet.

Leaders from the Revolutionary Committee of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Military Region, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 7335 Unit, including Pei Zhouyu, Li Quanchun, Tan Kaiyun, and Cao Danuo, attended the banquet.

    王恩茂同志在讲话中，代表新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会、新疆军区和新疆八百万各族人民，向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者表示最热烈的欢迎。他赞扬英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，坚持马克思列宁主义路线，屹立在欧洲反帝反修的最前线，同美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争，受到了全中国人民和全世界人民的钦佩。
    王恩茂同志说，新疆地处反帝反修前线。新疆各族人民和驻新疆人民解放军，遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，时刻保持警惕，加强战备，巩固边防，保卫祖国。如果苏修胆敢来犯，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭之。
    王恩茂同志说，中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队是最亲密的战友。我们一定遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，同英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。

    他说，阿尔巴尼亚正在开展的革命化运动，也是为了防止资本主义复辟，粉碎美帝、苏修的颠覆阴谋。敌人虽然遭到了可耻的失败，但是他们还是要在中国和阿尔巴尼亚搞颠覆活动的，我们必须提高警惕。如果他们想碰一碰社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，必将遭到彻底完蛋。中国和阿尔巴尼亚肩负着伟大的历史使命，我们一定要把反对美帝、反对苏修的原则性斗争进行到底。
    他热烈歌颂中阿两国、两党、两军的深厚友谊和钢铁般的团结。他说，世上没有任何力量能够破坏我们的战斗友谊和磐石般的团结。
