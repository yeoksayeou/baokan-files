The Shanghai workers welcomed the heroic messengers from the brotherly Albanian people, who are on the frontline of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, with the warmest welcome. They congratulated the Albanian people on the brilliant achievements made under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha and expressed that, like all the people of China, the Shanghai working class firmly supports Albania's revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact controlled by the Soviet revisionist traitors. They will, as instructed by the great leader Chairman Mao, "stand firmly on the side of the brotherly Albanian people at all times and under all circumstances," and unite, fight, and win together with the brotherly Albanian people.
