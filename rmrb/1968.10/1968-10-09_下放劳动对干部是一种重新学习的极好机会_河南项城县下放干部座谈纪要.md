The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "A large number of cadres going down to the countryside for labor is an excellent opportunity for them to relearn. Except for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, everyone should do this. Cadres in office should also go down in batches." More than a thousand cadres from Xiancheng County, Henan Province, who are fighting on the front lines of class struggle and production struggle in the countryside, have been studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions repeatedly in recent days. They have shared their personal experiences and discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They are determined to forever follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and stride forward on the path of revolutionization. Below is a summary of some comrades' speeches at the meeting.

A Crucial Measure for Anti-Revisionism and Preventing Revisionism

Tian Zhongyu (former deputy director of the county people's committee office):
Chairman Mao saved me from the bitter sea of the old society. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I was persecuted by the capitalist roaders, and it was Chairman Mao who saved me again. Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao! With an endless loyalty to Chairman Mao, I follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, roll up my trousers, and carry my backpack down to the countryside. In the countryside, I work with the poor and lower-middle peasants during the day and study Chairman Mao's works with them at night, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. Although the time is short, the experience is profound.

In the past, I sat in the office for a long time, did not approach the masses, and developed bureaucratic tendencies. In life, I sought comfort, talked about extravagance, and even found a wooden bed uncomfortable, wanting to replace it with a bamboo bed; I found a wooden chair uncomfortable, wanting to replace it with a rattan chair; I would quickly wash my hands with soap and water if they got dirty. As a result, my feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants gradually faded. Now I deeply feel that staying in the office will change you, and being away from labor will rot you. Cadres going down to the countryside for labor is a crucial measure for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, ensuring that the proletarian iron mountain of our country will never change color. I will definitely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao and forge ahead!

An Excellent Opportunity for Relearning

Sun Tianwen (former technician of the county agricultural bureau):
Chairman Mao teaches us: "A large number of cadres going down to the countryside for labor is an excellent opportunity for them to relearn." Through this period of going down to the countryside for labor, I deeply realized that Chairman Mao's teachings are great truths. After graduating from a middle school, I started working. For eighteen years, I have been stuck in the office, away from labor and the masses, and my bourgeois thoughts have become more and more pronounced. This time, I was sent down to Yinfeng Commune's Yan Village Brigade and stayed at the home of Liu Shuxin, an old poor peasant and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. Liu Shuxin's excellent quality of working hard for the revolution deeply educated me. I thought of my past, when I had mood swings and affected work because of promotion issues, and felt how small I was compared to Liu Shuxin!

In the past, I always thought I was knowledgeable and looked down on the masses. Through this period of labor practice, I deeply realized that I am the ignorant one, and the poor and lower-middle peasants are the knowledgeable ones. Although I graduated from an agricultural college, I do not know how to farm. This time, going down to the countryside, even simple farm work like cutting beans and threshing grains, I had to be taught by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Since going down to the countryside for labor, I have received the enthusiastic help and education of the poor and lower-middle peasants and learned a lot of knowledge that cannot be learned from books. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing." This is an absolute truth. In the future, I am determined to take the path of combining with the workers and peasants and work in the countryside for life.

The Best Way to Connect with the Masses

Liu Hongzhi (former cadre of Nandun Commune):
Chairman Mao issued the call for "a large number of cadres going down to the countryside for labor," and I have studied it repeatedly, linking it with the problems I encountered in the past. I deeply feel that only by participating in collective production labor can one closely connect with the masses; otherwise, one will be detached from the masses. The great leader Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught cadres to participate in collective production labor. However, in the past, I did not fully understand the significance of Chairman Mao's great teachings, saying it with my mouth and writing it on paper, but not putting it into action. Every time I went down to the countryside, I would ride a bicycle, running here and there, pointing fingers. Later, I was assigned to live in Weizhuang Brigade for a long time. At that time, I thought I would no longer be detached from the masses. In fact, I was not. I was physically among the poor and lower-middle peasants, but my heart was outside them, and my relationship with the masses was still not good. At that time, another comrade also lived in this brigade. His work style was the same as mine, and he did not participate well in collective production labor. The masses were very dissatisfied and said: "Such cadres do not think of us poor and lower-middle peasants, running around here and there, not participating in labor, to be honest, we don't even want to feed them." Although the masses were criticizing that comrade, they were actually criticizing me too. After the "streamlining and downsizing," I settled down in this brigade. After arriving at the brigade, I firmly implemented the "four together" with the poor and lower-middle peasants, not fearing dirt or hard work, getting up early and returning late during collective production labor. Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants' views of me are completely different. They say: "Comrade Liu, you look different from before, and you seem more approachable." A few days ago, I fell ill. Several poor and lower-middle peasants in their fifties and sixties came to visit me, asking about my health. The poor and lower-middle peasants care about me like this, treating me as one of them, making me realize that a cadre, as long as they listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the poor and lower-middle peasants will welcome them very much.

    下放劳动对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会
    ——河南项城县下放干部座谈纪要
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”河南省项城县战斗在农村阶级斗争、生产斗争第一线上的一千多名下放干部，连日来反复学习了毛主席的这一最新指示。他们结合自己的亲身体会，畅谈了毛主席最新指示的伟大意义。他们决心永远沿着毛主席指引的方向，在革命化的道路上阔步前进。下面是部分同志在座谈会上的发言纪要。
    反修、防修的重要措施
    田种玉（原县人委办公室副主任）：
    毛主席把我从旧社会的苦海里救了出来。无产阶级文化大革命中，我遭到走资派的迫害，又是毛主席把我救了出来。爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，毛主席是我最亲的人！我怀着无限忠于毛主席的红心，沿着毛主席指出的道路，卷起裤腿，背起背包，下到了农村。在农村，白天和贫下中农一起劳动，晚上和他们一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修。这样生活了两个多月，时间虽然不长，但体会却很深。
    过去自己长期坐机关，不接近群众，滋长了官僚主义作风。在生活上，图安逸，讲阔气，有个木板床还嫌睡着不舒服，想换一个棕床；坐个木椅子还嫌不柔软，想换个藤椅；手上沾点灰，就赶快用香皂水去洗洗。这样一来，同贫下中农的感情就逐渐淡薄了。现在我深深体会到，总坐机关会变，脱离劳动会烂。干部下放劳动，这是反修、防修的重要措施，是保证我国无产阶级铁打江山永不变色的大事情。我一定按照毛主席指引的道路奋勇前进！
    重新学习的极好机会
    孙天文（原县农业局技术员）：
    毛主席教导说：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会”。通过这一段下放劳动，我深刻地认识到，毛主席的教导是伟大的真理。我从中等学校毕业后，就踏上了工作岗位。十八年来，我一直蹲在机关里，脱离劳动，脱离群众，资产阶级思想越来越浓厚。这次下放到永丰公社阎庄大队，住在学习毛主席著作积极分子、老贫农刘书信大爷家里。刘书信老大爷一心为革命种田的优秀品质，深深教育了我。我联想到过去自己因为提级问题闹情绪、影响工作，感到和刘书信老大爷比起来，自己是多么渺小啊！
    我过去总以为自己很有知识，看不起群众。通过这一段劳动实践，我深刻认识到，无知的是自己，有知识的是贫下中农。我虽然是农业专科学校毕业，但是不会种庄稼。这次下放劳动，连割豆、打谷等简单的农活，都得由贫下中农把着手教。下放劳动以来，我受到贫下中农的热情帮助和教育，学到了许多在书本上学不到的知识。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”这是千真万确的真理。今后我决心走和工农群众相结合的道路，在农村干一辈子。
    联系群众的最好办法
    刘洪智（原南顿公社干部）：
    毛主席发出“广大干部下放劳动”的号召，我反复地学习，联系自己过去遇到的问题，深深感到只有参加集体生产劳动，才能密切联系群众；否则，就会脱离群众。伟大领袖毛主席曾多次教导干部要参加集体生产劳动。可是，过去我对毛主席的伟大教导的意义认识不足，说在嘴上，写在纸上，没有落实到行动上。每次下乡，总是骑着自行车，这里跑跑，那里看看，指手划脚。后来，我被分配到魏庄大队长期住队，这时满以为自己再不会脱离群众了。其实不然。我身在贫下中农之中，心在贫下中农之外，群众关系仍然不好。当时，另有一位同志也在这个大队住队，他的工作作风和我一样，没有很好地参加集体生产劳动，群众很反感地说：“这样的干部，不为俺贫下中农着想，东蹓蹓，西逛逛，不参加劳动，说实在的，俺连饭也不想管了。”群众虽然是批评那一位同志，其实连我也批评了。这次“精兵简政”后，我到这个大队安家落户。到了队里，我坚决和贫下中农实行“四同”，在参加集体生产劳动中不怕脏，不怕累，早起晚归。现在，贫下中农对我的看法就截然不同了。他们说：“老刘，咋看你和过去不一样了，觉得你亲切了。”前几天我病了。几位五六十岁的老贫农来看我，问寒问暖。贫下中农这样关心我，把我当自己人，使我认识到，一个干部，只要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，贫下中农是非常欢迎的。                    （新华社）
