	甲：No, I had been there several times before,
		This time it was completely different.
	乙：（White）Oh.
	甲：Portraits of Chairman Mao and quotation boards,
		The entire school was radiant with light.
		The resolutions were well-written,
		Firmly supporting the working class to lead.
		Every class held Mao Zedong Thought study classes,
		The will to unite was as strong as steel.
		Everyone studied Chairman Mao's latest directives,
		Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment without leaving a step.
		The political atmosphere in the school was indeed thick,
		The spring breeze filled the garden, all red.
		I was so engrossed in watching,
		The slogan shouting shook the heavens and the earth.
	乙：（White）How loud!
	甲：The auditorium was holding a meeting,
		Everyone shouted in unison: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!
		I eagerly walked into the auditorium,
		Wow! A worker was sharing his insights from studying Chairman Mao's works.

	甲：（White）Yes! We soldiers of the People's Liberation Army must be the backbone of the working class.
	乙：Old workers lead the teachers and students to the battlefield,
		The sound of fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism is loud.
		Seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform,
		Everywhere the battlefield is set up.
		Raise the red flag and beat the war drum,
		Cleanse the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev.
		The bourgeois educational line is criticized fiercely,
		Chairman Mao's strategic deployment is followed closely.
		The revolutionary great criticism burns fiercely,
		To sweep away all harmful elements,
		Spies, traitors, and capitalist roaders are exposed,
		The sky is clear and the earth is pure.
	甲：Hey! The situation of the educational revolution is indeed good,
		We must also find outstanding examples.

		This road is wide and broad.

		To receive re-education from workers and peasants.
		The teachers and students humbly seek guidance from workers and peasants,
		Thoroughly transform their worldview.
		"Grasp the revolution, promote production",
		Sail against the wind and waves bravely forward.
		Only by throwing oneself into the three great revolutionary movements,
		Can one create and innovate.
		Firmly take the working class as an example,
		Revolutionary enthusiasm soars to the heavens.
