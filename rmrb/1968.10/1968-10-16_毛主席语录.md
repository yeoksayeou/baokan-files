	Chairman Mao's Quotations

	A person has arteries and veins, through which blood circulates via the heart, and through the lungs to breathe, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without removing waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lack vigor.

    毛主席语录
    一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。
