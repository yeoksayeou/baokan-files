At the moment of welcoming the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out with great wisdom: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, proletarian politics should take command, and the path of cultivating technical personnel from among workers, as practiced by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, should be followed. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then returned to production practice." Chairman Mao's directive is the only correct path for cultivating proletarian engineering and technical personnel and is the battle program for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution to the end. The revolutionary technical personnel of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, determined to walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants for life. The bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao, we will definitely walk.

When the broad masses of revolutionary people in our country were enthusiastically welcoming Chairman Mao's latest directive on the educational revolution, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, as usual, came out with a howl, attacking our newly established proletarian educational system as only able to "cultivate technically shallow experts." From this howling, people once again saw the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique in their hatred for the proletarian revolutionary cause and their fear in the face of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The design revolutionary team of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory's Grinder Research Institute has technical personnel of worker origin and graduates from colleges and technical schools who are determined to integrate with workers. From our personal experiences, we deeply feel that only by implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive can proletarian engineering and technical personnel be most effectively cultivated.

The great leader of the proletarian revolution, Marx, once said: "Combining paid productive labor, intellectual education, physical education, and comprehensive technical education will elevate the working class to a level much higher than that of the nobility and bourgeoisie." Today, the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has taken the stage of science and technology and, with great achievements that shock the world, has demonstrated its boundless wisdom and talent, gloriously realizing Marx's prophecy of long ago. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is an example. Now, technical personnel of worker origin account for nearly half of the factory's total technical personnel. Since 1960, especially since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, almost all new products have been successfully developed by technical personnel of worker origin and young technical personnel in conjunction with workers, many of which have reached international advanced levels.

The selection of students from workers is the only correct path for cultivating proletarian engineering and technical personnel, first of all, because the working class has deep class feelings for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. They are best at understanding and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. "Once theory is grasped by the masses, it also becomes a material force." Technical personnel of worker origin, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, always link their scientific and technological work closely with the socialist cause of our motherland and the entire world proletarian revolutionary cause, and thus can fearlessly overcome all difficulties, fully mobilize their wisdom and talents. A technical worker who started as an apprentice at the age of fourteen and studied for four years later became the chief designer of a large-scale surface grinder. During the design process, he was obstructed and harassed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and reactionary technical "authorities." However, he did not seek fame or wealth, always thinking of the large-scale surface grinder as a product urgently needed for the development of our country's industrial technology, always thinking of the construction of our motherland must compete with imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries in speed and quality. He worked day and night, finally overcoming numerous difficulties, making this new product reach the international advanced level, and filling a gap in our country's precision grinding machines. Is this "technically shallow"?

The selection of students from workers is the only correct path for cultivating proletarian engineering and technical personnel, also because workers accumulate rich practical experience in production labor. After a few years of study, they can closely link theory with practice. They study with problems from production, learn quickly, and apply the theory to solve practical problems in production. A technical worker who graduated from primary school at the age of sixteen and then worked as an apprentice in the factory, worked as a worker for ten years, and then became a designer while studying part-time at a university. Thus, his theoretical knowledge and practical experience were well combined. Up to now, he has designed seven or eight new products, several of which have reached international advanced levels. Is this "technically shallow"?

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is knowledge? Since the existence of class society, the world's knowledge has only two kinds: one is the knowledge of production struggle, and the other is the knowledge of class struggle."

The worker technical personnel of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have used their wisdom and talents to successfully develop a series of important products such as the mirror surface grinding universal external cylindrical grinder, high center external cylindrical grinder, and large-scale surface grinder, all of which have reached international advanced levels. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they, together with the broad masses of workers, firmly defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and launched a fierce attack on the capitalist roaders in power, seizing their power. This fully proves that we have both knowledge of production struggle and knowledge of class struggle. The Soviet revisionist traitors' curse of our "technical shallowness" only shows their ignorance and vileness.

The revisionist educational system promoted by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is truly the one that cultivates technically shallow so-called "intellectuals." The Soviet mouthpiece *Pravda* once lamented that the graduates of Soviet higher technical schools currently lack knowledge in industrial procedures, economics, and the organization and management of production, and their practical abilities are "unbearably lacking." Soviet publications often reveal that the so-called "experts" allocated to factories and rural areas are completely unable to handle the jobs they are assigned, and they are unwelcome, with many forced to do other work. This situation has forced the Soviet higher and secondary professional education departments to issue a new "regulation on the allocation of young experts upon graduation," stipulating that "for the first three years of work, enterprise leaders are not allowed to use young experts in administrative management agencies, transfer them to jobs unrelated to their profession, or dismiss them without departmental approval." As for their so-called "deep knowledge" of "great experts" and "great authorities," the situation is not much better. In this regard, the workers and technical personnel of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory have deep feelings. A famous Soviet hydraulic "authority" once designed a hydraulic control box for our factory, boasting it as the world's first-class. This thing was bulky and had poor performance, so that within less than a year after the "expert" left, our workers and young technical personnel had to "operate on it" six times, making innovations, reducing its weight from forty-five kilograms to ten kilograms, reducing the number of parts from more than fifty to about ten, and greatly improving its performance. Again, a Soviet "great expert" who once worked in our factory was helpless against the noise of the gear oil pump of a grinder, and it was our factory's workers who displayed their wisdom and solved the problem. While this so-called Soviet "authority" secretly took back to his country the drawings of our workers' creation.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique so viciously attacks our great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on the educational revolution precisely because Chairman Mao's directive is our long-term plan for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism. Implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive can make the broad masses of workers and peasants take the stage of science and technology as masters, use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide science and technology, making science and technology better serve the socialist cause, and end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the scientific and technological field. Implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive can make the new generation of engineering and technical personnel become true "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers," forever not separating from proletarian politics, not separating from the masses of workers and peasants, not separating from production practice, ensuring that revisionism does not emerge. In short, implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive on the educational revolution and his great theory of continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship will thoroughly smash the foolish dreams of imperialists, modern revisionists, reactionaries of all countries, and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party to restore capitalism in China.

Therefore, Chairman Mao's latest directive not only becomes a great driving force for the broad revolutionary people to advance to victory but also like a sharp sword that stabs the nerves of the Soviet revisionist traitors. They are afraid that the Soviet people will use Chairman Mao's latest directive as a weapon to see through their evil conspiracy of promoting the revisionist educational line. These traitors attempt to block the great influence of Chairman Mao's latest directive and make clumsy apologies for their revisionist educational line. That's all, nothing more.

Today, Soviet education has become a tool for the Brezhnev and Kosygin traitor clique to fully restore capitalism and consolidate their revisionist rule. On the one hand, they strive to obstruct workers, peasants, and their children from entering higher education institutions. Their publications even shout that allowing "doormen, clerks, salespeople, etc." to go to college is "nonsense," slandering labor youth as "people who lack both ability and willingness to devote themselves to science," depriving the broad masses of workers and peasants of the right to master cultural and scientific knowledge, and attempting to make the laboring people forever become the objects of exploitation and oppression by a small privileged stratum. On the other hand, they strive to make higher education institutions a ladder for the children of the bourgeois privileged stratum to climb to the upper echelons of society. Brezhnev once advocated: "The state mainly 'recruits cadres engaged in economic work, party work, state work, diplomatic work, military work, and all social activities from experts trained in higher education institutions.' Kosygin also vigorously advocated: 'Higher education institutions are cultivating 'experts and production organizers.' For this purpose, they promote the 'experts rule the school' and 'intellectual education first' policies in higher education institutions, injecting revisionist poison into students, and recently shouting to implement the 'material incentive' principle in higher education institutions. Their purpose in doing so is to cultivate 'spiritual nobles' who sit on the heads of the laboring people, full of bourgeois worldviews, to cultivate loyal slaves and successors of the bourgeois privileged stratum and the revisionist clique, to maintain and consolidate their reactionary rule over the broad laboring people of the Soviet Union.

However, the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is irresistible. The rule of revisionism will not last long. The descendants of the October Revolution nurtured by Lenin and Stalin will definitely rise up in rebellion, thoroughly burying the Soviet revisionist traitor clique along with their revisionist educational line. The great Soviet people will eventually become the masters of their own country and the masters of science and technology.

    这条光明大道我们走定了
    上海机床厂磨床研究所设计革命化小分队
    在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的这一指示，是培养无产阶级工程技术人员的唯一正确的道路，是将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的战斗纲领。我们上海机床厂革命的技术人员坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，决心一辈子走与工农兵相结合的道路。毛主席指出的这条光明大道，我们是走定了。
    当我国广大革命人民最热烈欢呼毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示发表的时候，苏修叛徒集团又照例出来发出了一通嚎叫，攻击我们要建立的无产阶级的崭新的教育制度只能“培养知识浅薄的技术专家”。人们从这阵叫骂声中，再一次看到了苏修叛徒集团仇恨无产阶级革命事业的无耻嘴脸，以及他们在战无不胜的毛泽东思想面前所感到的恐惧。
    我们上海机床厂磨床研究所设计革命化小分队，有工人出身的技术人员，也有决心走同工人相结合的道路的大专院校和中等专业学校的毕业生。我们从自己的亲身经历中深深地体会到，只有贯彻毛主席的最新指示，才能最有效地培养无产阶级的工程技术人员。
    无产阶级革命的伟大导师马克思曾经说过：“把有报酬的生产劳动、智育、体育和综合技术教育结合起来，就会把工人阶级提高到比贵族和资产阶级高得多的水平。”今天，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，已经登上了科学技术的舞台，并以震惊世界的伟大成绩，显示出自己的无穷智慧和才能，光荣地实现了马克思当年的预言。我们上海机床厂就是一个例子。现在，工人出身的技术人员占了全厂技术人员总数将近一半，一九六○年以来，特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来，几乎所有的新产品都是工人出身的技术人员以及青年技术人员与工人相结合而试制成功的，其中许多产品都达到了国际先进水平。
    从工人中选拔学生所以是培养无产阶级工程技术人员唯一正确的道路，首先是因为工人阶级对毛主席、对共产党有深厚的阶级感情，他们最善于领会和活学活用毛泽东思想。“理论一经掌握群众，也会变成物质力量。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人出身技术人员，总是把自己的科技工作同祖国的社会主义事业和整个世界无产阶级革命事业紧密地联系在一起，因而能够不畏艰险，排除万难，最大限度地发挥他们的智慧和才能。有一位十四岁当学徒、经过四年学习的工人出身的技术员，后来担任了试制大型平面磨床的主任设计师。在设计的过程中，他受到党内一小撮走资派和反动的技术“权威”的层层阻挠和刁难。但是，他不为名、不为利，时刻想到大型平面磨床是发展我国工业技术所急需的产品，时刻想到祖国的建设事业必须与帝修反争速度、争质量。他夜以继日地工作，终于克服了重重困难，使这项新产品达到了国际先进水平，填补了我国精密磨床方面的一个空白点。这是“知识浅薄”吗？
    从工人中选拔学生所以是培养无产阶级工程技术人员唯一正确的道路，还因为工人在生产劳动中，积累了丰富的实践经验，他们经过几年的学习，就能够把理论和实践紧密地联系起来。他们带着生产中的问题学习，学得快，学了理论就去解决生产实际中的问题，用得上。有一个工人出身的技术人员，十六岁小学毕业后就到厂当学徒，先当了十年工人，再担任设计员，同时又进业余大学学习。这样，在他身上，理论知识和实践经验得到了很好的结合。到现在为止，他已进行了七、八种新产品的设计工作，其中好几种产品达到了国际先进水平。这是“知识浅薄”吗？
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“什么是知识？自从有阶级的社会存在以来，世界上的知识只有两门，一门叫做生产斗争知识，一门叫做阶级斗争知识。”
    我们上海机床厂用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人技术人员，以自己的智慧和才能试制成功了具有国际先进水平的镜面磨削万能外圆磨床、高中心外圆磨床、大型平面磨床等一系列重要产品；在无产阶级文化大革命中，又同广大的工人群众在一起，坚定地保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，向走资本主义道路的当权派展开了猛烈的进攻，夺了他们的权。这都充分证明，我们既有生产斗争知识，又有阶级斗争知识。苏修叛徒咒骂我们“知识浅薄”，只能表明他们愚昧无知和卑鄙无耻。
    苏修叛徒集团推行的修正主义教育制度，才真正是专门培养知识浅薄的所谓“知识分子”。苏修的喉舌《真理报》也曾经哀叹：苏联“高等技术学校的毕业生目前在工业规程、经济以及对生产的组织和管理方面的知识不够”，实践能力“少得不能容忍”。苏联报刊还经常透露，分配到工厂、农村的所谓“专家”，根本不能胜任所担负的工作，他们不受欢迎，许多人被迫改做其他工作。这种情况的发展，迫使苏修高等和中等专业教育部不得不作出一项新的“毕业的青年专家分配条例”，规定“在工作的头三年里，企业领导人无权把青年专家用在行政管理机构中，无权调动他们去做与其专业无关的工作，以及没有部的允许无权解职。”至于他们百般吹捧的所谓具有深奥知识的“大专家”、“大权威”的情况也好不了多少。在这方面，我们上海机床厂的工人和技术人员都是深有体会的。苏修的一个著名的液压“权威”，曾经为我厂设计了一个自诩为世界第一流的液压操纵箱。这个东西体积庞大，性能很差，以至这位“专家”走后不到一年，我们的工人和青年技术人员就不得不对它作了六次“大开刀”，进行革新，使它的重量由四十五公斤减少到十公斤，零件由五十多个减少为十个左右，性能也大大提高了。又如一个曾在我厂工作的苏修“大专家”，连对一台磨床的齿轮油泵噪音也束手无策，结果还是我厂的工人发挥了聪明才智，才解决了这个问题。而这位堂堂的苏修“权威”，却把我们工人的这项创造的图纸偷偷地带回国去了。
    苏修叛徒集团如此恶毒攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，正是因为毛主席的这一指示是我们反修防修的百年大计。贯彻毛主席的最新指示，就能使广大的工人、农民以主人翁的姿态登上科学技术的舞台，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指导科学技术，使科学技术更好地为社会主义事业服务，结束资产阶级知识分子统治科学技术界的现象。贯彻毛主席的最新指示，就能使新一代的工程技术人员成为真正的“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，永远不脱离无产阶级政治、不脱离工农群众、不脱离生产实践，保证不出修正主义。总而言之，贯彻毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示和关于在无产阶级专政的条件下继续进行革命的伟大理论，就将彻底粉碎帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派和党内一小撮走资派在中国复辟资本主义的痴心妄想。
    因此，毛主席的最新指示不仅成为鼓舞广大革命人民胜利前进的巨大动力，而且象一把利剑刺痛了苏修叛徒们的神经。他们害怕苏联人民以毛主席最新指示为武器，识破他们推行修正主义教育路线的罪恶阴谋。这些叛徒妄图阻挡毛主席最新指示的伟大影响，为他们的修正主义的教育路线进行拙劣的辩解。如此而已，岂有他哉。
    今天，苏修的教育已经成为勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团全面复辟资本主义、巩固其修正主义统治的工具。一方面，他们竭力阻挠工农青年和工农子女进入高等院校。他们的报刊甚至叫嚷，让“守门人、文书、售货员等等”上大学是“奇谈怪论”，诽谤劳动青年是“既没有能力，又不愿献身于科学的人”，剥夺广大工农群众掌握文化科学知识的权利，妄图使劳动人民永远成为一小撮特权阶层剥削、压迫的对象。另一方面，他们又竭力使高等学校成为资产阶级特权阶层子女登上上层社会的阶梯。勃列日涅夫就曾鼓吹：国家主要“是从经过高等学校培养的专家中吸收从事经济工作、党的工作、国家工作、外交工作、军事工作和从事一切社会活动的干部。”柯西金也竭力鼓吹：高等学校是培养“专家和生产组织者”。为此，他们在高等学校中推行“专家治校”、“智育第一”的方针，对学生大肆灌输修正主义毒素，最近又叫嚷要在高等学校中贯彻“物质刺激”的原则。他们这样做的目的，就是要培养骑在劳动人民头上的、满脑子资产阶级世界观的“精神贵族”，培养资产阶级特权阶层的忠实奴仆和修正主义集团的接班人，来维护和巩固他们对苏联广大劳动人民的反动统治。
    但是，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理是不可抗拒的。修正主义的统治是不会长久的。列宁斯大林教养下的十月革命的后代，一定会奋起造反，把苏修叛徒集团连同他们的修正主义教育路线彻底埋葬。伟大的苏联人民终将重新成为自己国家的主人和科学技术的主人。
