In the days leading up to and following National Day, the northern winter wheat regions of our country experienced widespread rainfall, which is highly beneficial for the ongoing autumn sowing. According to information from the central meteorological authorities, from September 30th to October 7th, the entire northern winter wheat region generally received between 15 to 40 millimeters of rain, with some areas receiving over 50 millimeters. Notably, regions that had previously experienced drought, such as Hengshui and Cangzhou in Hebei Province, and Dezhou, Liaocheng, Huimin, and Tai'an in Shandong Province, received between 50 to 80 millimeters of rain. This timely rainfall has alleviated the drought conditions in the winter wheat regions, providing favorable conditions for the sowing and germination of winter wheat.
