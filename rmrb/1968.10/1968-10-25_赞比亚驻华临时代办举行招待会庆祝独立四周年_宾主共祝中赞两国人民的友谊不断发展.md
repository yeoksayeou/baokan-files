Zambia's Chargé d'Affaires Holds Reception to Celebrate the Fourth Anniversary of Independence
Host and Guests Jointly Wish for the Continuous Development of Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Zambia

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress attended the reception. Chargé d'Affaires Lumby said the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved tremendous victories.

Vice Minister Ji Pengfei pointed out that the "treaty" between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia is a treaty between master and slave, which cannot conceal the fascist crimes of the Soviet revisionists.

BEIJING, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) — Zambia's Chargé d'Affaires Lumby held a reception in Beijing today to celebrate the fourth anniversary of Zambia's independence.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu of the People's Republic of China, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and other guests attended the reception at the invitation.

The reception was held in a friendly atmosphere. Lumby, the Chargé d'Affaires, and Vice Minister Ji Pengfei of the Chinese Foreign Ministry spoke at the reception.

In his speech, Lumby introduced Zambia's efforts and achievements in national construction since independence. He stated that the Zambian people are determined to build an economy truly controlled by Zambia.

Lumby expressed in his speech that the Zambian people support all African peoples who are fighting against imperialism, support the Arab struggle against Israeli aggression, and support the struggle of the Vietnamese people.

He said, "The peoples of Zambia and China are engaged in a common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. The deep friendship between the People's Republic of China and Zambia is continuously developing and strengthening. The Zambian people are grateful for the support given by the Chinese government and people and their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong."

He said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has achieved tremendous victories. This is evident in the establishment of revolutionary committees throughout China (except Taiwan). On behalf of the government and people of the Republic of Zambia, I extend our congratulations to the Chinese people and their beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and we wish the Chinese people continued success."

Ji Pengfei, in his speech, praised the achievements of the Zambian people in eliminating colonialist forces, maintaining national independence, and developing the national economy.

Ji Pengfei said, "Currently, the situation of people around the world opposing imperialism and its accomplices is excellent. The more the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists collude, the more the people of the world see them as birds of a feather. The struggle of the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has entered a new historical period."

He strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' tacit approval of the Soviet revisionists' occupation of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet revisionists' tacit approval of the U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Vietnam. He said, "Recently, the Soviet revisionist clique coerced the Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership to sign a so-called 'treaty' aimed at legalizing the Soviet military occupation of Czechoslovakia. This is a treaty between master and slave, which cannot conceal the fascist aggression crimes of the Soviet revisionists. At the same time, on the issue of Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are doing everything they can to push their 'bombing halt and deception' grand conspiracy and grand deception. He pointed out that the collusion and unrepentant evil of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists will only provoke greater anger and resistance from the people, accelerating their own complete downfall."

Ji Pengfei said, "Zambia, in international affairs, opposes the so-called 'Non-Proliferation Treaty' concocted by the collusion of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, opposes U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, condemns the Soviet revisionists' armed aggression against Czechoslovakia, and supports the struggle of African and Arab peoples against imperialism and colonialism. We admire Zambia's spirit of fearlessness and justice."

Ji Pengfei said, "The seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, will better fulfill their internationalist duties and more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and peoples around the world."

He said, "The peoples of China and Zambia have always sympathized with and supported each other in their struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism and in the construction of their respective countries. We are deeply convinced that the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia will be continuously consolidated and developed through our joint efforts."

Guests invited to the reception also included officials from relevant government departments, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to the reception.

    赞比亚驻华临时代办举行招待会庆祝独立四周年
    宾主共祝中赞两国人民的友谊不断发展
    董必武副主席郭沫若副委员长出席　伦比代办说中国文化大革命取得巨大胜利
    姬鹏飞副部长指出苏捷“条约”是主奴之间的条约，丝毫掩盖不了苏修的法西斯罪行
    新华社二十四日讯  赞比亚驻中国大使馆临时代办伦比今天在北京举行招待会，庆祝赞比亚共和国独立四周年。
    中华人民共和国副主席董必武，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若等，应邀出席了招待会。
    招待会在友好的气氛中进行。伦比临时代办和我国外交部副部长姬鹏飞在招待会上先后讲话。
    伦比临时代办在讲话中介绍赞比亚独立后在建设国家方面所作的努力和所取得的成就。他表示，赞比亚人民决心建立一个真正由赞比亚控制的经济。
    伦比在讲话中表示，赞比亚人民支持一切正在进行反帝斗争的非洲人民，支持阿拉伯抗击以色列侵略的斗争，支持越南人民的斗争。
    伦比说，赞中两国人民正进行着反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争。人民中国和赞比亚之间的深厚友谊正不断得到发展和加强。赞比亚人民感谢中国政府和人民及其伟大领袖毛主席给予我们的支持。
    他说，由中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了巨大的胜利，这集中表现在中国全国（除台湾以外）都成立了革命委员会。我代表赞比亚共和国政府和人民向中国人民和他们敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席表示祝贺，祝贺中国人民不断取得的成就。
    姬鹏飞在讲话中赞扬赞比亚人民在肃清殖民主义势力、维护民族独立和发展民族经济方面所取得的成就。
    姬鹏飞说，当前，世界各国人民反对帝国主义及其帮凶的形势，一片大好。美帝、苏修越是勾结在一起，世界人民就越看清楚他们是一丘之貉。世界各国人民反对美帝、苏修的斗争，已经进入一个新的历史时期。
    他强烈谴责美帝默许苏修占领捷克斯洛伐克，苏修默许美帝霸占越南南方。他说，最近，苏修叛徒集团胁迫捷修领导集团，签订了一个妄图使苏军占领捷克斯洛伐克合法化的所谓“条约”，这是主子和奴才之间的条约，丝毫掩盖不了苏修的法西斯侵略罪行。与此同时，在越南问题上，美帝、苏修正在千方百计地推行他们“停炸诱和”的大阴谋、大骗局。他指出，美帝、苏修的狼狈为奸、怙恶不悛，到头来只能激起人民更大的愤怒和反抗，加速他们自己的彻底垮台。
    姬鹏飞说，赞比亚在国际事务中，反对美帝、苏修勾结炮制的所谓“防止核扩散条约”，反对美帝国主义侵略越南，谴责苏修武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克，支持非洲人民和阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。对赞比亚这种不畏强暴、坚持正义的精神，我们表示钦佩。
    姬鹏飞说，经过无产阶级文化大革命锤炼的七亿中国人民，在伟大领袖毛主席的教导下，将会更好地履行自己的国际主义义务，更有力地支援世界各地被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争。
    他说，中赞两国人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、建设各自的国家的事业中，一向相互同情，相互支持。我们深信，中赞两国人民之间的深厚的友谊，必将在我们两国的共同努力下，不断得到巩固和发展。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有政府有关部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会的负责人。
    各国驻中国使节也应邀出席了招待会。
