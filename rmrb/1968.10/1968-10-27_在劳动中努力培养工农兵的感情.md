Some students from a class at Beijing Petroleum Institute were previously poisoned by revisionism and despised labor. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team conducted re-education for the students. These students have changed and are now actively participating in labor, and they have decided:

To strive to cultivate feelings for workers, peasants, and soldiers in labor

In the rice fields of Dongsheng People's Commune in Haidian District, revolutionary young soldiers from Class 64(1) of the Mining Department at Beijing Petroleum Institute are wading through cold muddy water, bundling rice sheaves. They are chasing each other, laughing and chatting, full of enthusiasm.

"Hey, take a rest, you're all covered in mud!" a worker from the propaganda team, who is laboring with the young soldiers, affectionately calls out to them.

"No, teacher, we want to wash away the dirt in our minds with the sweat of our labor. We want to temper our loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao in harsh environments!" The young soldiers, while carefully picking up the rice grains that have fallen to the ground, respond enthusiastically.

The students of Class 64(1) love labor so much because the working class has re-educated them.

After the workers' propaganda team entered the school, they brought the true colors of the working people. Under the guidance of the worker teachers, the revolutionary young soldiers fear neither dirt nor hardship, actively cleaning toilets and clearing garbage. However, some students do not fully understand the significance of participating in labor. Once, when worker Zhang Lin from the propaganda team was clearing garbage, a group of students from Class 64(1) passed by, covering their noses and running away. Teacher Zhang saw this and took it to heart. Especially when he learned that most of the students in this class were born into working-class families, but under the influence of the revisionist educational line, they developed a tendency to despise and detach themselves from labor, he felt even more uneasy. He decided to help the young soldiers raise their awareness, to give them a lesson in labor, and to make them forever retain the true colors of the working people.

In the evening, Teacher Zhang sat with the revolutionary young soldiers of this class, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," and discussing the profound significance of intellectuals becoming laborers. Teacher Zhang said meaningfully, "We workers feel restless if we don't labor for a day. We see those parasites who live without labor and feel angry. But some of you eat the food and wear the clothes of the working people, and as soon as labor is mentioned, you feel inferior. How can we expect you to carry coal in the mines and spread fertilizer in the mud in the future?"

Hearing Teacher Zhang's criticism, the young soldiers blushed and lowered their heads.

Teacher Zhang continued, "Think about it, when you were at home, weren't you often participating in labor? Why, after coming to the city and studying for a few years, have you become lazy? This is all because you have been poisoned by the revisionist educational line!"

Teacher Zhang's words stirred the hearts of the young soldiers. Reflecting on the changes in their thoughts and feelings, the young soldiers were all shocked. They stood up one by one, angrily denounced the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the revisionist educational line to poison the youth, and decided to make up for the lesson in labor, to wash away the dirt in their minds with the sweat of their labor, and to cleanse the poison of the revisionist educational line.

From then on, the young soldiers of this class changed. They not only voluntarily sweep the corridors and clean the toilets in the school but also actively request to go to the countryside and factories to participate in labor, learning from the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants in labor, and cultivating the feelings of the working people.

### 在劳动中努力培养工农兵的感情

    北京石油学院一个班的一些同学，过去受了修正主义的毒害，鄙视劳动。工人毛泽东思想宣传队对同学进行了再教育。这些同学转变了，积极参加劳动，并且决心：
    在劳动中努力培养工农兵的感情
    在海淀区东升人民公社的稻田里，北京石油学院矿六四（1）班的革命小将正趟着冰凉的泥水，捆扎稻捆。他们你追我赶，有说有笑，干劲十足。
    “喂，休息休息吧，都成了泥人啦！”和小将们一起参加劳动的工人宣传队的师傅亲切地喊他们。
      “不，师傅，我们要用劳动的汗水冲掉头脑里的污泥，我们要在艰苦的环境里锤炼对伟大领袖毛主席的忠心！”小将们一边细心地把掉在地下的稻穗拣起来，一边豪情满怀地回答着。
    矿六四（1）班的学生这样热爱劳动，是工人阶级对他们进行再教育的结果。
    工人宣传队开进学校以后，带来了劳动人民的本色。革命小将们在工人师傅的带动下，不怕脏，不怕累，积极打扫厕所，清理垃圾。但是也有的学生对参加劳动的意义认识不足。有一次，工人宣传队队员张林师傅清理垃圾，矿六四（1）班一群学生路过现场时，捂着鼻子跑过去了。张师傅看在眼里，记在心里。特别是，当他了解到这个班的同学大多数出生在劳动人民家庭，但是，在修正主义教育路线影响下，产生了鄙视劳动，脱离劳动的倾向，心中更是不安。他决心帮助小将们提高认识，给他们补上劳动这一课，让他们永远保持劳动人民的本色。
    晚上，张师傅和这个班的革命小将坐在一起，学习了毛主席关于“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教导，畅谈了知识分子劳动化的深远意义。张师傅意味深长地说：“我们工人一天不劳动，就觉得手没处放，劲没处使。我们看到那些不劳而获的寄生虫，心里就窝火。可你们有些人吃着劳动人民的饭，穿着劳动人民的衣，一提劳动，就觉得低人一等。象这样下去，怎能指望你们将来到矿井里背煤，到泥水里撒粪呢！”
    听着张师傅的批评，小将们红着脸，低下了头。
    张师傅接着说：“你们想想，你们在家里的时候，不也是经常参加劳动吗？为什么进了城市，上了几年大学，就四体不勤了呢？这都是中了修正主义教育路线的毒啊！”
    张师傅的一席话，使小将们心里翻腾起来。回顾思想感情的变化，小将们都大吃一惊。他们一个个起来愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线毒害青年的罪行，决心补上劳动这一课，用劳动的汗水荡涤自己头脑中的污泥浊水，冲刷修正主义教育路线的流毒。
    从此以后，这个班的小将们变了。他们不但在学校里主动扫楼道、刷厕所，而且积极要求到农村、到工厂参加劳动，在劳动中向工人阶级和贫下中农学习，培养劳动人民的感情。
