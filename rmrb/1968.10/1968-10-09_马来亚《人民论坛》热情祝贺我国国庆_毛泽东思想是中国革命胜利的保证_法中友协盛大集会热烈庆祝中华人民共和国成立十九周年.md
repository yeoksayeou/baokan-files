According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 8th, a message from Singapore: The organ of the Malayan political party, the Singapore People's Party, "People's Forum," published an article on the 1st, warmly congratulating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The article said: At this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great victories, the Chinese people are celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. "This is not only a glorious festival for the 700 million Chinese people, but also a glorious festival for all the people of the world! We, the people and revolutionaries of Malaya (including Singapore), together with all the people and revolutionaries of the world, jointly celebrate this great and glorious festival!"

The article wrote: "The Chinese people, tempered and tested by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have unprecedentedly raised their political awareness. Especially in their understanding, mastery, and application of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, it is better than any other period in the past, with a leap-forward improvement. The widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, the deep penetration of Mao Zedong Thought into people's hearts, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and strategic deployment, these are the most powerful and sharpest weapons for the Chinese people to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The article concluded: "We, the people of Malaya (including Singapore), are looking up to Beijing, together with the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, singing 'The East Is Red' in unison, and shouting in unison: Long live the People's Republic of China!
