The capital's workers, PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, workers, peasants, PLA soldiers, revolutionary cultural workers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and workers and PLA heroes and models from across the country who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, as well as PLA troops participating in the National Day activities, totaling 100,000 people, held a grand rally at the Beijing Workers' Stadium today. They warmly welcomed the honorable envoys of the heroic Albanian people from the front lines of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism—the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee Politburo member, Deputy Premier and Minister of Defense Bekir Balluku, and the Albanian Party and Government delegation he led.

The rally enthusiastically praised the great revolutionary friendship between the two parties, the two countries, and the two armies of China and Albania. It warmly congratulated the Albanian people on their brilliant achievements in the revolutionization movement and expressed that the Chinese people and the PLA, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly support Albania's revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact.

Central, Central Cultural Revolution Group, and other responsible comrades Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, and Wen Yucheng attended the rally.

Also attending the rally were Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee Wu De.

The welcoming rally was held in the magnificent Beijing Workers' Stadium. The venue was adorned with countless red flags, presenting a festive atmosphere and exuding a revolutionary spirit of unity and struggle between the two parties, the two countries, and the two armies. Directly opposite the rostrum, there were giant portraits of China's great leader Chairman Mao and Albania's great leader Enver Hoxha. The national flags of China and Albania were raised on either side of the portraits.

There were two red quotation boards in the venue, which were very eye-catching. They displayed the following quotations:

"If the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and their running dogs dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will only face a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure."

—Chairman Mao

"The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a fatal and heavy blow to the imperialists led by U.S. imperialism, the modern revisionists led by Soviet revisionism, and other reactionaries."

—Enver Hoxha

Around the venue, there were dozens of banners written in both Chinese and Albanian, welcoming the delegation. In the center of the venue, there was a giant banner stretching across the entire field, reading: "Long Live China-Albania Friendship!"

At around 3 PM, Balluku and the members of the Albanian Party and Government delegation, Marko, Charcani, Theodosi, Nataneli, and others, accompanied by Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, and Wen Yucheng, ascended the rostrum.
