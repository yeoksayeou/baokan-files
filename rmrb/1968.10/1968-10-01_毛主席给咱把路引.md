Chairman Mao shows us the way,
The poor and lower-middle peasants follow closely,
The path of the people's commune is broad and smooth,
We march forward steadfastly without wavering.

Chairman Mao shows us the way,
His highest directives are in our hearts,
The whole nation learns from Dazhai in agriculture,
We fight against nature and strive to be people of Dazhai.

Chairman Mao shows us the way,
Class struggle must be grasped tightly,
We fiercely attack the Chinese Khrushchev,
The socialist mountains and rivers are firm and stable.

Chairman Mao shows us the way,
Hundreds of millions of people are of one mind,
We vow to carry the revolution through to the end,
The communist society will come soon.

    毛主席给咱把路引
    河北饶阳县五公大队社员　李惠琴
    毛主席给咱把路引，
    贫下中农紧紧跟，
    人民公社康庄道，
    勇往直前不变心。
    毛主席给咱把路引，
    最高指示记在心，
    全国农业学大寨，
    战天斗地做大寨人。
    毛主席给咱把路引，
    阶级斗争要抓紧，
    向中国赫鲁晓夫猛开炮，
    社会主义江山牢又稳。
    毛主席给咱把路引，
    亿万人民一条心，
    誓把革命进行到底，
    共产主义社会早来临。
