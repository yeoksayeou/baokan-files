The reactionary Indian government's vice premier, Desai, recently put on a begging act in Washington. This incident reflects the serious economic crisis faced by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, indicating that they are having a tough time.

On October 2, Desai shouted to news reporters in Washington that the Chinese army had "occupied" Indian territory and that the Indian government wanted to "drive them out." He hoped that by making such noises, he could beg more money from his American masters to keep the Indian "regular army intact and sufficiently strong."

However, the Indian reactionaries' old trick of begging for money has lost its effectiveness. Their American masters, due to their failures in Vietnam, financial crises, and internal disputes, have decided to drastically cut "foreign aid." Desai, unwilling to give up, said that India "completely understands" that a country sometimes has to focus on its own problems, but he still hoped that "rich countries" would recognize their responsibility to give more money to countries like India.

Due to the U.S. imperialists' severe financial crisis, the "International Development Association" under their control is increasingly short of funds. Before going to the U.S., Desai anxiously shouted in London that this international economic institution should quickly provide the loans it had promised to countries like India, without waiting for the U.S. to decide how much it can afford. He said, "We cannot allow a country's (referring to the U.S.) current internal difficulties to paralyze an international institution."

The entire capitalist world is rotting day by day, and neither the U.S. nor other Western capitalist countries can save the Indian reactionaries. As for the Indian reactionaries daring to use anti-China military adventures to escape their difficulties, it will only hasten their doom.

    印度反动政府向美帝乞讨
    美帝经济困难自身难保，印度政府讨饭碰壁
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：印度反动政府副总理德赛最近在华盛顿演出的一幕乞讨丑剧，反映出美帝国主义及其走狗都陷入严重的经济危机，日子很不好过。
    德赛二日在华盛顿向新闻记者叫嚷什么中国军队“占领”了印度的地区，印度政府要把他们“赶出去”。他一心期望通过这样的叫嚷，可以向美国主子多乞讨点钱，从而把印度的“常规军队保持完整和足够强大”。
    但是印度反动派这种乞钱的惯技已经失灵。它的美国主子由于侵越失败、财政危机、内部争吵，决定大量削减“对外援助”。德赛还不死心，他说，印度“完全理解”一个国家有时“一心注意它自己的问题”，但是他仍然希望“富有的国家”应当认识到它们有责任向印度那样的国家多赏赐一点钱。
    由于美帝的严重的财政危机，它控制下的“国际开发基金协会”越来越缺少基金，德赛在去美国之前在伦敦着急地叫嚷，这个国际经济机构应当赶快向印度这样的国家提供它们答应给的贷款，而不要等待美国决定它能负担多少。他说，“我们不能允许一个国家（指美国）当前的内部困难使一个国际机构痪瘫下来。”
    整个资本主义世界一天天烂下去，美帝和西方其他资本主义国家都绝对救不了印度反动派的命。至于印度反动派胆敢用反华军事冒险来摆脱困难，只能使它更快走向灭亡。
