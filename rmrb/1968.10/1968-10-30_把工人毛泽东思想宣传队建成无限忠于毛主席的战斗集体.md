Since the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team was stationed at Chongqing Medical College, we have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions, "The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle," and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, we have used Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to focus on the ideological revolutionization of the propaganda team itself. This has greatly raised the political consciousness of the team members and ensured the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in the college.

Our Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Chongqing Medical College comes from seven factories and enterprises. To successfully complete the glorious mission entrusted to us by the great leader Chairman Mao, and to shoulder the great historical mission of leading the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation with Mao Zedong Thought and re-educating intellectuals, we must arm the team members with Mao Zedong Thought, achieve the revolutionization of people's ideology, and build the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team into a revolutionary and combat-ready collective that is unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao. Therefore, after entering the college, we focused on studying Mao Zedong Thought, carrying out the "Five Good" team member activities, and continuously raising the political consciousness of the broad masses of team members. Good deeds and good people emerged in waves. Some old workers, in order to promote the realization of revolutionary unity in the college, worked day and night without rest; some comrades, in order to mobilize students to return to school and make revolution, ran dozens of miles every day; some workers, when they fell ill, did not make a sound and continued to work; some workers' children were hospitalized for surgery, and their spouses were ill, with several telegrams urging them to return home, but they still insisted on staying. They said: "Revolution is the most important thing, personal matters are secondary. We, the working class, must have a heart for the thirty billion people, not just for ourselves." During the National Day period, half of the old workers from the Sixth Steel Company voluntarily stayed in school to help revolutionary teachers and students set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Many revolutionary teachers and students were moved to say: "The working class studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought well, which is not only a good example for us but also a good leader."

We immediately carried out the "Three Loyalties" activity, holding short-term Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively. As soon as we entered the college, we extensively carried out the activity of being "unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." We placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. All team members insisted on the system of reporting in the morning and summarizing in the evening, reading every day, and listening to broadcasts every day, always and everywhere using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their words and deeds. At the beginning, some comrades lacked experience in re-educating intellectuals and were not good at grasping policies. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals were issued, we printed and distributed them overnight, organized study sessions, and delivered Chairman Mao's latest instructions to revolutionary teachers and students. Some old workers sincerely examined their previous erroneous views on intellectuals without analysis, further strengthening the relationship between the worker propaganda team and the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

The propaganda team, in response to the team members' active thoughts and the current struggle's needs, held short-term Mao Zedong Thought study classes. When we first entered the school, the two factions had serious confrontational sentiments, and some comrades developed a sense of difficulty, fearing that they could not tackle or solve this "old and difficult" problem. The leading group seized on this "fear and difficulty," held short-term study classes, and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great instructions on "the working class must lead everything" and the "Three Articles." Through study, the political consciousness of the team members was greatly raised. Old worker Yu Dehai said: "We, the working class, fight to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and die to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao has given us such a great task. If we do not resolutely complete it, it would be the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao." Under his influence, the entire detachment took active action, vigorously publicizing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and quickly stopped the "internal war," achieving revolutionary unity. They deeply felt: "No matter how difficult, with Mao Zedong Thought, it is not difficult. We, these 'big roughnecks,' are supposed to lead intellectuals and can lead intellectuals."

Establishing a core team for ideological and political work, addressing the team members' active thoughts. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Grasp ideological education, which is the central link for uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles." Vice Chairman Lin also pointed out that political work must grasp the living ideological education. As soon as the propaganda team entered the school, it paid attention to cultivating a core team for ideological and political work, mainly composed of outstanding old workers. Through them, we understand the ideological trends of the broad masses of team members, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and timely carry out ideological and political education to promote the revolutionization of the team members' ideology. Currently, each platoon has a core team of thirty to forty people for ideological and political work. They regularly analyze and study the team members' active thoughts, ensuring that problems are solved without delay, allowing the propaganda team's leading cadres to focus on the fundamentals.

Not long after the propaganda team entered the school, some comrades revealed bourgeois factionalism, and there were differences in helping the two factions achieve revolutionary unity. At this time, old worker Luo Niancheng reported to the leadership on one hand and organized the entire class to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "the working class has the most foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution" on the other hand. He also actively talked to that comrade. He said: "We are the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, not the bourgeois factionalism Propaganda Team. The helmsman of the boat, if he cannot hold the rudder, the boat will capsize!" With his help, that comrade quickly corrected his mistake.

Humbly accepting the masses' opinions, correctly understanding oneself. Chairman Mao teaches: "Do not be afraid of criticism. The entire army will correctly understand the world and change the world in this process of criticism." After entering the school, the broad masses of propaganda team members, with unconditional loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and with the determination to seize the educational battlefield, dared to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. However, due to sometimes inappropriate methods, the enthusiasm of the revolutionary little generals was injured. Once, the propaganda team posted large slogans, not paying attention to covering the slogans posted by the revolutionary little generals. After the revolutionary little generals raised objections, the members of the leading group sincerely made self-criticisms and corrections to the revolutionary little generals. This incident deeply educated the Red Guards. They said: "The worker propaganda team's exemplary action of daring to criticize itself gave our bourgeois factionalism a blow to the head." The little generals actively covered their factional slogans and actively promoted revolutionary unity.

Recently, under the illumination of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, Chongqing Medical College has leveled the hills and achieved revolutionary unity. In the face of victory, some members of the propaganda team developed arrogance and complacency. The propaganda team's leading group, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, "We must always maintain the style of being humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried," adopted the method of "inviting in and going out" and held nine different types of symposiums with students, teachers, workers, and cadres, extensively soliciting the masses' opinions on the propaganda team and listening to the masses' criticisms. Then, they summarized the masses' opinions and handed them over to the propaganda team members for discussion, making the broad masses of team members realize: All our achievements are due to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and all victories should be attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao. The more we are in a good situation, the more we need to maintain a clear mind and vigorous fighting spirit to carry the revolution to the end. The worker comrades said: "If we relax, the enemy will attack. If there is the word 'arrogance' in our minds, we cannot be completely loyal to Chairman Mao." After that, every time the propaganda team completed a task, they solicited the masses' opinions, and under the supervision of the revolutionary teachers and students, they continuously raised their political consciousness.

Using the revolutionization of the leadership to promote the revolutionization of the team members. Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." We follow Chairman Mao's great teachings. Since being stationed at Chongqing Medical College, we have always focused on the ideological revolutionization of the leadership. The leading members of the propaganda team, like the team members, insist on an unshakable learning system, take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and his series of latest instructions, consciously put themselves on the front line of class struggle, and temper their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Most members of the leading group can often go deep into the masses, study, propagate, execute, and defend Chairman Mao's series of instructions with the team members, timely grasp the situation, cultivate models, summarize experiences, and guide work. When encountering major issues, the leading members take the lead personally, lead the masses, and fight together.

Currently, an activity to create a "Four Good" propaganda team and "Five Good" team members, with the "Three Loyalties" as the main content, is being extensively and deeply carried out in the propaganda team. We believe that through this activity, the glorious revolutionary tradition and excellent style of the People's Liberation Army: insisting on the "Four Firsts," promoting the "May 30th" style, carrying forward the "Three Great Democracies," and observing the "Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention," will be widely spread. The ideological revolutionization and organizational revolutionization of our worker propaganda team will definitely be raised to a new level.

    把工人毛泽东思想宣传队建成无限忠于毛主席的战斗集体
    驻重庆医学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队
    我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻重庆医学院以后，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的亲切教导，在人民解放军的帮助下，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓宣传队本身的思想革命化建设，大大提高了队员的政治觉悟，有力地保证了毛主席一系列最新指示在学院的贯彻落实。
    我们驻重医工人毛泽东思想宣传队，来自七个工厂企业。为了胜利完成伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的光荣任务，担负起用毛泽东思想领导学校斗、批、改，对知识分子进行再教育的伟大历史使命，必须用毛泽东思想武装队员，实现人的思想革命化，把工人毛泽东思想宣传队建设成为无限忠于毛主席的革命化战斗化的集体。所以，我们进学院后就狠抓毛泽东思想的学习，开展五好队员活动，使广大队员的政治觉悟不断提高，好人好事层出不穷。有的老工人，为了促进学院实现革命大联合，废寝忘食，日夜操心；有的同志为了动员学生回校复课闹革命，每天奔走几十里；有的工人生了病，一声不响，坚持工作；有的工人孩子住院开刀、爱人有病，几次来电报催他回家，他仍坚持不走。他们说：革命事大，自己的事小，我们工人阶级心里要有三十亿，不能只有个人。国庆节期间，六冶二公司来的半数老工人，自动留校帮助革命师生开办毛泽东思想学习班。许多革命师生感动地说：工人阶级学习毛泽东思想学得好，用得好，既是我们的好榜样，又是我们的好领导。
    广泛开展“三忠于”活动，大办短期毛泽东思想学习班
    我们一进学院就广泛开展“无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线”的活动，把活学活用毛泽东思想，落实毛主席一系列最新指示，放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位。全体队员坚持早请示，晚汇报，天天读，天天听广播等制度，时时处处用毛泽东思想统帅自己的言行。开始，部分同志缺乏对知识分子再教育的经验，掌握政策不够好。毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示发表后，我们连夜翻印、组织学习，并把毛主席的最新指示送到革命师生手里。有些老工人诚恳地检查了以前对知识分子不加分析的错误看法，进一步密切了工人宣传队和广大革命师生的关系。
    宣传队针对队员的活思想和当前斗争的需要，开办短期毛泽东思想学习班。我们刚进校时，学校两派对立情绪比较严重，一部分同志产生了畏难情绪，怕啃不动、解决不好这个“老大难”问题。领导小组抓住这“一怕一难”，开办短期学习班，反复学习毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大指示和“老三篇”。通过学习，大大提高了队员的政治觉悟。老工人于德海说：“我们工人阶级生为捍卫毛主席的革命路线战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的革命路线献身。毛主席把这样大的任务交给我们，如果不坚决去完成，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。”在他的带动下，全分队积极行动，大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席的最新指示，使两派很快停止了“内战”，实现了革命大联合。他们深有体会地说：千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难。我们这些“大老粗”就是要领导知识分子，而且能够领导知识分子。
    建立一支思想政治工作骨干队伍，抓好队员的活思想
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”林副主席也指出，政治工作必须抓住活的思想教育。我们宣传队一进校，就重视培养以优秀老工人为主的思想政治工作骨干队伍。通过他们了解广大队员的思想动向，以毛泽东思想为武器，及时做好思想政治教育，促进队员思想革命化。目前每个中队都有三十至四十人的思想政治工作骨干队伍。他们定期分析研究队员活思想，做到了问题解决不过夜，使宣传队领导干部集中精力抓根本。
    宣传队进校不久，个别同志流露出资产阶级派性，在帮助两派实现革命大联合的问题上，产生分歧。这时，老工人罗念成便一方面向领导反映，一方面组织全班学习毛主席“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性”的教导，并主动找那个同志谈心。他说：“我们是毛泽东思想宣传队，不是资产阶级派性宣传队，撑船的人，把不住舵，可就要翻船啊！”在他的帮助下，那个同志很快改正了。
    虚心听取群众意见，正确认识自己
    毛主席教导说：“不要怕批评，全军在这种批评过程中，将会正确地认识世界，并改造世界。”我们进校后，广大宣传队员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，抱着坚决占领教育阵地的决心，大刀阔斧，敢想，敢说，敢干。但由于有时方法不当，挫伤了革命小将的积极性。一次，宣传队贴大幅标语，没注意覆盖了革命小将贴出的标语，革命小将提出意见后，领导小组成员诚恳地向革命小将作了检讨、纠正。这件事深深地教育了红卫兵小将。他们说：“工人宣传队勇于自我批评的模范行动，给我们的资产阶级派性当头一棒。”小将们主动覆盖了自己的派性标语，积极促进革命大联合。
    最近，在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，重庆医学院铲平了山头，实现了革命大联合。在胜利面前，宣传队有些同志滋长了骄傲自满和松劲情绪。宣传队领导小组，牢记毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风”的教导，采取“请进来，走出去”的方法，先后召开了学生、教师、工人、干部等不同类型的座谈会九次，广泛征求群众对宣传队的意见，倾听群众批评。然后，把群众的意见综合起来交给宣传队员讨论，使广大队员认识到：我们的一切成就，都是靠了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，一切胜利都应该归功于伟大领袖毛主席。越是在大好形势下，越是要保持清醒的头脑和旺盛的斗志，才能把革命进行到底。工人同志们说：我们松一松，敌人攻一攻，脑子里有了“骄”字，就不能对毛主席彻底的忠。以后，宣传队每完成一项任务，就征求一次群众意见，在革命师生的监督下，不断提高自己的政治觉悟。
    用领导班子的革命化带动队员的革命化
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”我们遵循毛主席的伟大教导，从进驻重医后，一直重视狠抓领导班子的思想革命化。宣传队领导成员和队员一样，坚持雷打不动的学习制度，带头活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席一系列最新指示，自觉地把自己摆在阶级斗争的第一线，锤炼对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心。领导小组的多数成员，能够经常深入到群众中去，和队员一起学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛主席的一系列指示，及时地掌握情况，培养典型，总结经验，指导工作。遇到重大的问题，领导成员就亲自挂帅，带领群众，共同战斗。
    目前，一个以无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”为主要内容的创造四好宣传队、五好队员的活动，正在宣传队里广泛、深入开展。我们相信，通过这一活动，人民解放军的光荣革命传统和优良作风：坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，遵守三大纪律八项注意等，将得到广泛传播，我们工人宣传队的思想革命化和组织革命化一定能够提高到一个新的水平。
