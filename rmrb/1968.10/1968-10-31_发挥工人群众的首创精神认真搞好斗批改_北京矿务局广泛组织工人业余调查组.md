The Beijing Mining Bureau Revolutionary Committee, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's support team, has followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation." They have overcome rightist conservative thinking, fully mobilized the masses, and organized workers' part-time investigation teams in a planned and organized manner to conduct in-depth investigations and research in various departments across the bureau. This has sparked a vigorous mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The workers' part-time investigation teams emerged during the struggle, criticism, and transformation. When this new phenomenon first appeared, some members of the revolutionary committees in certain mines did not fully recognize its importance and had various concerns. Some feared that the masses would focus too much on investigating living and welfare issues, deviating from the main direction; some feared that mutual investigations among the masses would affect unity; and some feared that it would impact the revolutionary criticism and production. To address these concerns, the revolutionary committees in these mines organized all members to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and review his teachings: "At present, the peasant movement is a great issue. ... All revolutionary parties and comrades will be tested by them and will decide to support or oppose them. Will they lead them from the front, or will they follow behind and criticize them, or will they oppose them from the front?" "Leaders must be at the forefront of the movement, not lagging behind it." Through study, everyone's understanding deepened, and they unanimously agreed that only by fully unleashing the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity could the struggle, criticism, and transformation be thoroughly carried out. Therefore, they must resolutely support and actively lead the workers' part-time investigation teams. After discovering the workers' part-time investigation teams, the bureau's revolutionary committee firmly supported them, holding two on-site meetings to summarize and exchange experiences, setting examples, and promoting the movement's further development. According to incomplete statistics, as of now, there are over 600 workers' part-time investigation teams across the bureau, with over 4,000 workers participating and producing more than 100 investigation reports related to carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The broad masses of workers are determined to bravely shoulder the honorable responsibility of the leading class, in accordance with the image of the working class, to thoroughly and universally reform all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base and all institutions and systems that do not meet production needs, completing the great historical task assigned by Chairman Mao to the working class to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The working class entering the superstructure to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation has further inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, promoting the development of production. The entire mining bureau completed the state's production plan five days ahead of schedule in September and has exceeded production targets every day in October.

    发挥工人群众的首创精神认真搞好斗批改
    北京矿务局广泛组织工人业余调查组
    全局已组成若干调查小组，写出了第一批调查报告。广大工人决心按照工人阶级面貌，对一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑和不适合生产需要的机构、制度进行彻底普遍的改革
    据新华社三十日讯　北京矿务局革命委员会，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，按照伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的教导，克服右倾保守思想，充分发动群众，有领导、有计划地广泛组织工人业余调查小组，对全局各个部门进行深入细致的调查研究，掀起了一个蓬蓬勃勃的群众性斗、批、改新高潮。
    工人业余调查小组是在斗、批、改中涌现的一种新生事物。这种新事物刚出现时，个别矿的革命委员会的某些成员对其重要意义认识不足，存有种种顾虑。有的怕群众偏重调查生活福利问题，容易扭转大方向；有的怕群众互相调查，影响团结；有的怕影响革命大批判和生产。针对这些活思想，这些矿的革命委员会组织全体成员认真学习了毛主席最新指示，重温了毛主席的伟大教导：“目前农民运动的兴起是一个极大的问题。……一切革命的党派、革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？”“领导一定要走在运动的前面，不要落在它的后面。”通过学习，大家提高了认识，一致认为，只有充分发挥群众的革命积极性和创造力，才能把斗、批、改搞彻底。因此对工人业余调查小组一定要坚决支持，积极领导。局革命委员会发现工人业余调查小组这一新生事物后，坚决支持，先后召开了两次现场会议，及时地总结和交流了工人业余调查小组的经验，树立了样板，使这一群众运动更深入地发展。据不完全统计，截至目前为止，全局工人业余调查小组已有六百多个，有四千多名工人参加，写出了一百多篇有关搞好斗、批、改的调查报告。广大工人决心勇敢担负起领导阶级的光荣责任，按照工人阶级的面貌，对一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，和各种不适应生产需要的机构、制度实行彻底、普遍的改革，完成毛主席赋予工人阶级领导斗、批、改的伟大历史任务。
    工人阶级进入上层建筑领域领导斗、批、改，更进一步激发了工人群众的革命干劲，促进了生产的发展。全矿务局九月份提前五天完成国家生产计划，十月份每天都超额完成生产任务。
