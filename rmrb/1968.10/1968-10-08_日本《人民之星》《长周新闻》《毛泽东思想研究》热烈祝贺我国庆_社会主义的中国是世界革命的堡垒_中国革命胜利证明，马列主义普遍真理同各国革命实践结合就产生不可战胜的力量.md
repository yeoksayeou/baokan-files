Japanese "People's Star," "Weekly Long," and "Mao Zedong Thought Studies" Warmly Congratulate Our National Day

Socialist China is a bastion of world revolution

The victory of the Chinese revolution proves that the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the revolutionary practices of various countries produces an invincible force

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated October 6: Tokyo reports: The organ of the All-Japan Coordination Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left Wing), "People's Star," published an editorial on October 5 to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	The editorial emphasizes: "Imperialism and modern revisionism had once placed their hopes on China changing color. However, this expectation has been thoroughly shattered. China has become the most reliable and unbreakable stronghold for the revolutionary people of the world."

	The editorial points out that the historical process from the victory of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution to the victory of the Cultural Revolution clearly shows that Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage.

	The editorial calls on the revolutionary people of Japan to seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's inscription to Japanese worker friends: "As long as one seriously achieves the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is undoubtedly certain."

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated October 4: Tokyo reports: The Japanese "Weekly Long" published an editorial on October 2 to warmly celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	The editorial states that under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, transforming China from a backward semi-colonial, semi-feudal country into a socialist country. Now, world history has entered an era where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse, and socialism is heading towards global victory. The victory of the Chinese revolution proves that the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, once combined with the specific practices of the revolutions of various countries, will produce an invincible force to defeat any ruthless rulers and oppressors, to change the objective world, and to push history forward.

	The editorial states that today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing all the conspiracies of imperialism and reactionary forces attempting to change China's color.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated October 5: Tokyo reports: The magazine "Mao Zedong Thought Studies," published by the "Mao Zedong Thought Research Association," published an editorial in its 10th issue to warmly congratulate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and to celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	The editorial states: "The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao solves the major issue of preventing the emergence of revisionism under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat in both practice and theory. This is a great contribution of Mao Zedong Thought to Marxism-Leninism and a great contribution to the world revolutionary movement."

	The editorial states: "We regard the great Chairman Mao and China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party as the shining star of socialism and communism, and as the bastion of world revolution." The editorial points out that the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership is not only a traitor to socialism, communism, and the people of the world, but has also become the imperialist aggressor wearing a "socialist" mask, as Lenin pointed out, namely, social imperialism. The editorial concludes with a call for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

    日本《人民之星》《长周新闻》《毛泽东思想研究》热烈祝贺我国庆
    社会主义的中国是世界革命的堡垒
    中国革命胜利证明，马列主义普遍真理同各国革命实践结合就产生不可战胜的力量
    据新华社六日讯　东京消息：日共（左派）全国协议会机关报《人民之星》五日发表社论，祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    社论强调说：“帝国主义和现代修正主义曾经把他们的希望寄托在中国改变颜色上。但是，这种期待被彻底粉碎了。中国已经成为世界革命人民最可靠的、任何敌人也打不破的坚强堡垒。”
    社论指出，从中国新民主主义革命的胜利到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利这一历史进程，清楚地表明毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东同志全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。
    社论号召日本革命人民认真学习毛泽东同志书赠日本工人朋友们的题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”
    据新华社四日讯　东京消息：日本《长周新闻》二日发表社论，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    社论说，中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，使中国从落后的半殖民地、半封建的国家变为社会主义国家。现在，世界历史已经进入了帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。中国革命的胜利，证明了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，一旦与各国革命的具体实践相结合，就会产生打败任何穷凶极恶的统治者和压迫者的不可战胜的力量，就能够改造客观世界，就能够推动历史向前发展。
    社论说，今天，中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下正在开展的无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了企图使中国改变颜色的帝国主义和反动势力的一切阴谋。
    据新华社五日讯　东京消息：日本“毛泽东思想研究会”出版的杂志《毛泽东思想研究》第十期发表社论，热烈祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年，欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    社论说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，从实践和理论上解决了在无产阶级专政条件下，防止产生修正主义的重大问题。这是毛泽东思想对马克思列宁主义的伟大贡献，是对世界革命运动的伟大贡献。”
    社论说：“我们把伟大的毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下的中国，看作是社会主义、共产主义的光辉星斗，看作是世界革命的堡垒”。社论指出，以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，不仅是社会主义、共产主义和世界人民的叛徒，而且已经成为列宁所指出的戴着“社会主义”假面具的帝国主义侵略者，即社会帝国主义。社论最后高呼中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁。
