Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "A person has arteries and veins, and through the heart, blood circulates. The lungs also participate in respiration, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without eliminating waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lack vigor."

Chairman Mao's vivid analogy contains profound dialectical insights. Chairman Mao teaches us to view the proletarian revolutionary party as an organization that develops through the process of revolutionary metabolism, not as a rigid, unchanging organization.

"The proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous." The party's process of expelling the old and taking in the new is an inevitable law of class struggle. If the proletarian party does not expel the counter-revolutionary elements and class exploiters who have infiltrated it, and does not absorb advanced elements with proletarian consciousness, the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party will impose bourgeois dictatorship on the proletariat and the broad masses. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China has continuously expelled the old and taken in the new, eliminating the "waste" within the party and absorbing a large amount of fresh blood, making the party continuously develop and grow stronger.

Through the trials and tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of revolutionary rebels with proletarian consciousness have emerged among the broad proletarian revolutionary masses. They have a high level of awareness in the struggle between the two lines, strong class struggle consciousness, stand on the front lines of struggle, and dare to stand out to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, especially firmly opposing revisionism. They are the most loyal to Chairman Mao and follow him the closest. We should actively absorb such new, vigorous elements with proletarian revolutionary spirit into the party, and resolutely expel from the party those traitors, spies, all counter-revolutionary elements, diehard capitalist-roaders, class enemies, and degenerate elements who have infiltrated the party with conclusive evidence, making our party purer, stronger, and more united.

With Chairman Mao's wave, I advance. I am determined, together with the broad revolutionary masses, to study and propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the fastest speed and the highest enthusiasm, to quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to seriously carry out party rectification and party-building work, and to complete the great historical mission of expelling the old and taking in the new in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    党的“吐故纳新”是阶级斗争的必然规律
    解放军驻辽宁凤城丝绸厂支左人员、共产党员　袁德军
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”
    毛主席这个生动的比喻，包含着极深刻的辩证法。毛主席教育我们：要把无产阶级革命党看成在革命的新陈代谢过程中发展着的组织，不要看成凝固的、一成不变的组织。
    “一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。”党的“吐故纳新”，是阶级斗争的必然规律。无产阶级的党，如果不把混进来的反革命分子和剥削阶级分子清除出党，不吸收具有无产阶级觉悟的朝气蓬勃的先进分子入党，混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，就要对无产阶级和广大人民实行资产阶级专政。中国共产党，就是在毛主席的英明领导下，不断地“吐故纳新”，排除党内的“废料”，吸收大量的新鲜血液，使党不断发展壮大起来的。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命的考验和锻炼，在广大无产阶级革命派中，涌现出了一大批具有无产阶级觉悟的造反派战士。他们两条路线斗争觉悟高，阶级斗争观念强，站在斗争第一线，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线敢于挺身而出，特别反对修正主义很坚决。他们对毛主席最忠，跟得最紧，应当积极地吸收这样的有无产阶级革命朝气的新鲜血液入党，把那些混进党内证据确凿的叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子、顽固不化的走资派、阶级异己分子、蜕化变质分子，坚决清除出党，使我们的党更加纯洁，更加坚强，更加团结。
    毛主席挥手我前进。我决心同广大革命群众一道，以最快的速度，最高的热情，学习、宣传好毛主席的最新指示，使毛主席的最新指示迅速落实，并且一定认真搞好整党建党工作，胜利地完成在无产阶级文化大革命中“吐故纳新”的伟大历史使命。
