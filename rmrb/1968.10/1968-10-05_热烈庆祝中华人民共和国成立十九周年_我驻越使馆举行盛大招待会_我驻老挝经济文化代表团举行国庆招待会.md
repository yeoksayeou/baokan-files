The Chinese Embassy in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a grand reception on the evening of September 30 to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, headed by Nguyen Van Tien, was also invited to attend the reception.

Also present were some diplomatic envoys from other countries stationed in Vietnam.

Chargé d'affaires Chen Liang and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong both delivered speeches at the reception.

In his speech, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said, "On the occasion of celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, the Vietnamese people warmly congratulate the Chinese people, who are armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, on their great victories in their entire revolutionary cause, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the construction of Chinese socialism, in the fierce struggle against imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism, in the strong support for the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and in the cause of recovering an inseparable part of China's territory—Taiwan."

Pham Van Dong said, "For a long time, the Vietnamese people have consistently received the wholehearted support and assistance of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people in their revolutionary cause, especially in the current struggle against the U.S. for national liberation, the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China have given us strong support and invaluable aid. On this occasion, I would like to express the deep gratitude of our people to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the fraternal Chinese people."

Chen Liang, in his speech, talked about the extremely brilliant victories achieved by the 700 million Chinese people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, as well as the great victory and profound significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Chen Liang warmly congratulated the heroic Vietnamese people on their great victories in the war against the U.S. for national liberation. He pointed out that the situation in the Vietnamese people's war against the U.S. for national liberation is excellent. Although the Vietnamese people will still encounter various difficulties and twists and turns on their forward march, we are firmly convinced that the indomitable Vietnamese people, under the leadership of their great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh, will, as long as they carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution and persist in a protracted war, surely achieve final victory in the war against the U.S. for national liberation.

Chen Liang expressed: The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will, as in the past, resolutely support the fraternal Vietnamese people in carrying the war against the U.S. for national liberation through to the end.

The reception was held in a friendly atmosphere.

The Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission in Laos held a reception to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission in Laos held a reception on September 29 to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Invited to attend the reception were: General Singkapo, representative of the Kaysone Phomvihane Military Region Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, Major Kongsai, representative of the Military Command of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, and officials from departments and units of the Lao Patriotic Forces.

The Vietnamese Economic and Cultural Mission in Laos was also invited to attend the reception.

Yang Zemin, head of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission in Laos, spoke first at the reception. He introduced the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "In our country, except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and the whole country is red. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This great victory is the brilliant achievement of our revolutionary people, who, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have united as one and fought hard."

In his speech, Yang Zemin strongly condemned the crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique in betraying Marxism-Leninism, acting as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, betraying the revolutionary cause of the people of various countries, and suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionist clique's military occupation of Czechoslovakia fully exposed the fascist ugly face of the Soviet revisionist clique, making the people of the whole world see more clearly the reactionary and rotten nature of the modern revisionist clique.

Yang Zemin also warmly praised the great victories achieved by the Lao people in their struggle against the U.S. for national liberation.

General Singkapo, representing the Lao People's Liberation Army and the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, spoke, praising the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao in the revolution and socialist construction, especially in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "The victory of the Chinese revolution is of great significance to the people of the world who are rising up to make a revolution, such as guerrilla warfare, rural encirclement of cities, and building armed forces while fighting. He said, 'We, the Lao people, have always regarded every achievement of the Chinese people as our own achievement and feel proud that the great Chinese people are advancing on the road to revolutionary victory.'"

He stressed that the victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, especially Chairman Mao Zedong, have made great China even stronger, becoming a strong rear base for our Lao people's revolution, promoting the revolutionary struggle of the people of Southeast Asia and the world against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. General Singkapo finally said, "The Lao and Chinese peoples have a traditional friendship. Today, in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, this friendship has been further strengthened, ensuring that our two peoples, together with the fraternal Vietnamese people, will defeat U.S. imperialism."

The reception was held in an atmosphere of unity and friendship.
