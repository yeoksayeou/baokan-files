The Soviet "Stalin Group" recently distributed a leaflet titled "Follow Stalin's Path," calling on the Soviet proletariat and working people to overthrow the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and restore proletarian dictatorship. The contents of the leaflet are as follows:

Over the past fifteen years, during the rule of the Khrushchev and Brezhnev cliques, profound changes have taken place in our country. Everyone can see these changes, but far from everyone understands their true nature. The character of the Soviet government has changed, as have the country's politics, ideology, and economy. The obvious consequences of these changes are the split in the communist movement, the isolation of the Soviet Union, and the loss of its prestige, as well as domestic difficulties. However, the Khrushchev and Brezhnev political system attempts to cover up its own bankruptcy with demagogic propaganda, boasting of fictitious victories and achievements. The discontent and pressure from the workers and peasants have forced the ruling clique to grant the laboring people some minor concessions, thereby maintaining its shaky position and preserving its privileges and comforts at the expense of the workers and peasants.

Comrades! See through the essence of things! Do not be deceived by Brezhnev's empty talk and Kosygin's minor concessions!

The basic result of the activities of the Khrushchev and Brezhnev political system over its fifteen years of existence is the establishment of a ruling group representing the interests of the bourgeoisie, based on the fusion of the upper stratum of intellectuals and hereditary intellectuals with the upper stratum of party and state officials who have become detached from the people. This arrogant stratum, which has enriched itself at the expense of the working class, creates the illusion that it is fighting for the interests of the working class. Those who truly fight for the interests of the working class do not need privileges and good living conditions obtained by plundering the workers and peasants. The ruling clique has long since ceased to serve the people; it has become a tumor parasitic on the people, choking the people.

Workers! Fight against all privileges! Fight against the exploitation of the ruling clique—the new bourgeois "employers"!

The ruling clique actively promotes the import of bourgeois ideology and bourgeois culture. It does this not only for its own enjoyment but primarily to "transform" the consciousness of the workers and peasants, to stifle the revolutionary spirit of the working class, and to make the working class "adapt" to being effectively exploited for the interests of the ruling clique. The ruling clique uses intellectuals to spread the corrupting bourgeois ideology of vulgar individualism, egoism, and pornography. A large number of intellectuals follow their "vanguard," that is, the ruling bourgeois exploiting clique, and constantly replenish this clique. Intellectuals today are the soil for opportunism and bourgeois degeneration, the fixed base and sole reliable support of the ruling clique. This is why the revisionist ruling clique does not instill proletarian class consciousness in intellectuals but tries to "elevate" the working class to the level of bourgeois intellectual thought, which is closely linked to bourgeois ideology. Therefore, our slogan is:

Eradicate bourgeois intellectual consciousness and instill proletarian consciousness!

The revisionist ruling clique strives to instill in the workers the idea that the interests of the workers are apolitical, that workers have nothing to do with politics, that the main thing for workers is personal happiness, and that politics is the business of the upper stratum, not the masses of workers. This line, known as the Khrushchev and Brezhnev economic line, is a means of eliminating the political role of the working class and implementing the politics of a clique that has nothing in common with proletarian politics. The working class is a great revolutionary force. The Khrushchev and Brezhnev leaders, who have lost the last vestiges of proletarian revolutionary spirit, class consciousness, and internationalism, are afraid of the working class.

To seize the political helm from this clique is the glorious cause of the working class.

The exploiting clique and the strata around it are most afraid of mentioning support, aid, and defense of the world revolution. Because strengthening support and aid for the world revolutionary movement requires them to give up their privileges. This clique does not counter imperialist aggression, stop the export of counter-revolution, or support the armed struggle of the peoples of various countries for liberation, but pursues a policy of "peaceful" compromise and concession to imperialism. This policy of capitulation to imperialism makes the Soviet Union an obstacle to the world revolution.

Down with this clique's policy of capitulation and retreat! Long live the policy of proletarian revolutionary offensive!

Any government has a class character. The Khrushnev and Brezhnev upper stratum has actually abolished the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union and has "legalized" it, replacing the power of the working class with the dictatorship of a clique of bourgeois degenerates. The only form of government opposed to bourgeois dictatorship is proletarian dictatorship.

Down with the dictatorship of the clique of bourgeois degenerates! Join the struggle to restore the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union!

The characteristic of the ruling clique is to hide its dirty deeds from the people and to use Lenin's name to cover them up. For fifteen years, this clique has put Lenin's name in its mouth and defiled it. It is already clear that the line of the ruling clique has nothing in common with Leninism.

Be able to distinguish true Leninists from those who use Lenin's name to cover themselves! Bravely expose the treacherous deeds of the revisionist ruling clique—the clique of degenerates!

While using Lenin to cover themselves, the ruling upper stratum is defaming the great Leninist Y.V. Stalin. This dirty slander is not the goal itself. Defaming Stalin's reputation is a convenient pretext for them to revise Stalin's revolutionary line and replace it with a policy of capitulation, bourgeois ideology, and an exploitative economy. This is the true purpose of this clique.

Struggle to smash Khrushchev and Brezhnev revisionism! Struggle to restore the spirit, cause, and honor of Stalin!

The modern revisionists—the bourgeois degenerates of the Soviet Union—are conducting dirty slander against the Communist Party of China and its leaders, supporting the anti-revolutionary faction against the revolutionary line of the Communist Party of China, and attempting to instigate civil war in China.

Hands off the People's Republic of China!

The Brezhnev upper stratum hypocritically claims that they yearn for the "unity of all revolutionary forces," but at the same time exclude all truly revolutionary forces from this "unity." It is clear that the Brezhnevites are striving for unity around their line of capitulation, attempting to force revolutionary forces to abandon the struggle against imperialism and turn them from forces opposing imperialism into forces for "peaceful coexistence" with imperialism.

Struggle against the leadership of revisionism! Struggle for the leadership of Marxism! Struggle for the world revolution! Workers of the world, unite under the banner of Marxism-Leninism! Workers and oppressed peoples of the world, unite in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism!

    苏联“斯大林小组”的一张传单
    苏联“斯大林小组”最近散发了一张题为《走斯大林的道路》的传单，号召苏联无产阶级和劳动人民起来打倒苏修叛徒集团的统治，重建无产阶级专政。传单内容如下：
    最近十五年，即赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫上层集团执政的年代，在我国发生的深刻变化，大家都看得出来，但是，远非所有的人都看到这些变化的真正内容。苏联的政权性质改变了，国家的政治、意识形态和经济也改变了。这些变化的明显后果是，共产主义运动的分裂，苏联的孤立和威信扫地，国内处境困难。但是，赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫政治制度企图靠他们的政客的蛊惑宣传，来掩盖自己的破产，鼓吹虚构的胜利和成就。工人、农民的不满和压力，迫使当权的上层集团给劳动人民一点小恩小惠，赖以维持自己摇摇欲坠的地位，保持自己靠损害工农的利益得来的特权和安逸。
    同志！要看事情的本质！不要被勃列日涅夫的空话和柯西金的小恩小惠蒙骗了！
    赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫政治制度在它存在的十五年内活动的基本结果是，在知识分子和世袭知识分子的上层人物同脱离了人民的党政机关的上层人物相结合的基础上，建立了当权的代表资产阶级利益的剥削集团。这个妄自尊大的阶层，靠损害工人阶级的利益发财致富，但是它却制造一种假象，似乎它是为工人阶级的利益奋斗的。真正为工人阶级的利益奋斗的人，不需要靠掠夺工农得来的特权和好日子。当权的上层集团早已不再为人民服务了，它已成为寄生在人民身上的瘤，它掐着人民的脖子。
    工人们！为反对一切特权而斗争！为反对统治集团——新的资产阶级“雇主”集团的剥削而斗争！
    统治集团积极鼓励输入资产阶级意识形态、资产阶级文化。它需要这样做，不仅是为了自身的享乐，而且首先是为了“改造”工农的意识，为了扼杀工人阶级的革命精神，从而使工人阶级“适应”于被有效地利用来为统治集团的利益服务。统治集团利用知识分子来散布资产阶级庸俗的个人主义、利己主义、色情等有腐蚀作用的资产阶级意识形态。大量的知识分子追随自己的“先锋队”，即追随当权的资产阶级剥削集团，并不断地补充这个集团。知识分子今天是机会主义和资产阶级蜕化变质的土壤，是统治集团固定的基础和唯一可靠的支柱。这就是为什么修正主义统治集团不向知识分子灌输无产阶级的阶级意识，而是力图把工人阶级“提高”到同资产阶级的意识形态紧密结合的资产阶级知识分子思想的水平。所以我们的口号是：
    根除资产阶级知识分子的意识，灌输无产阶级的意识！
    修正主义统治集团竭力向工人灌输一种思想，似乎工人的利益是超政治的，工人与政治无关，对于工人来说，主要的是个人的幸福，还说什么，政治是上层人物的事，而不是工人群众的事。这条称之为赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫经济主义的路线，是抹杀工人阶级的政治作用的一种手段，是推行与无产阶级政治毫无共同之处的该集团政治的一种手段。工人阶级是巨大的革命力量。丧失了最后一点点无产阶级革命性、阶级性和国际主义的赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫头目们，害怕的正是工人阶级。
    把政治方向盘从这个集团的手中夺过来，这是工人阶级的光荣事业。
    剥削集团及其周围的阶层最怕提到对世界革命的支持、援助和保卫。因为加强对世界革命运动的援助和支持，就需要他们放弃自己的特权。这个集团不是反击帝国主义的侵略，制止反革命输出，支持各国人民争取解放的武装斗争，而是推行对帝国主义“和平”妥协和退让的政策。这种向帝国主义投降的政策，使苏联变成世界革命的障碍。
    打倒这个集团的投降和退却政策！无产阶级的革命进攻政策万岁！
    任何政权都有阶级性。赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫上层集团实际上取消了苏联的无产阶级专政，并已使之“合法化”，从而用资产阶级蜕化分子集团的专政代替了工人阶级的政权。同资产阶级专政相对立的唯一的政权形式，就是无产阶级专政。
    打倒资产阶级蜕化分子集团的专政！投身到重建苏联无产阶级专政的战斗中去！
    统治集团的特点是竭力向人民隐瞒自己所干的肮脏勾当，竭力用列宁的名字来加以掩饰。十五年来，这个集团把列宁的名字挂在嘴上，并加以玷污。已经够清楚了，统治集团的路线与列宁主义是毫无共同之处的。
    要善于把真正的列宁主义者同那些用列宁的名字掩饰自己的人区别开来！勇敢地揭露修正主义统治集团——变质分子集团的叛卖行径！
    当权的上层集团在用列宁掩饰自己的同时，对伟大的列宁主义者约·维·斯大林进行诽谤。这种肮脏的诽谤并非目的本身。败坏斯大林的声誉，是他们修正斯大林的革命路线，代之以投降政策、资产阶级意识形态和剥削经济的合适的借口。这才是这个集团的真正目的。
    为粉碎赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫修正主义而奋斗！为恢复斯大林精神、斯大林事业、斯大林的荣誉而奋斗！
    现代修正主义者——苏联的资产阶级蜕化分子，对中国共产党及其领袖们进行肮脏的诽谤，支持反对中国共产党的革命路线的亲赫鲁晓夫的反对派，妄图在中国煽起内战。
    不准干涉人民中国！
    勃列日涅夫上层集团虚伪地宣称他们渴望“一切革命力量的团结”，但同时却把一切真正革命的力量统统排除在这个“团结”之外。很清楚，勃列日涅夫分子极力追求的是围绕在他们投降主义路线周围的团结，妄想迫使革命力量放弃同帝国主义的斗争，使他们从反对帝国主义的力量变为同帝国主义“和平共处”的力量。
    反对修正主义的领导权，为马克思主义的领导权而奋斗！为在全世界开展革命而奋斗！全世界无产者在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下联合起来！全世界无产者和被压迫人民在反对帝国主义的革命斗争中联合起来！
