Iraqi newspaper *Al-Jumhuriya* on October 10th published a commentary pointing out that the new proposal on the Middle East issue currently being plotted in the United Nations General Assembly is a new conspiracy by imperialism against the Arab people.

According to reports, the so-called new proposal on the Middle East issue aims to place the large tracts of Arab land seized by Israeli aggressor forces during the June 1967 aggression under the control of the United Nations. The proposal attempts to legalize the existence of the United States' tool of aggression against Arab land, "Israel," and to extinguish the blazing flames of armed struggle waged by the Palestinian guerrillas against U.S. imperialism and Zionism in the occupied territories.

The commentary emphasized: "The Arab nation has already discovered that the true path to liberating their seized lands is the armed struggle carried out by the vanguard of the commando units in the occupied territories."

The commentary said: The Middle East issue is the issue of the Middle East people, the issue of struggle, and the issue of self-determination. "The issues of the people and struggle are not issues that can be resolved by staying indoors. The place to resolve these issues is the battlefield."

The commentary concluded that the United Nations' new conspiracy to infringe upon Arab rights will inevitably meet the same fate as all previous dubious plans.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, October 14th, the Iraqi News Agency on October 13th published a commentary condemning U.S. imperialism for further pursuing its policy of aggression against the Arab people and preparing to supply a batch of fighter-bombers to its tool of aggression, Israel. The commentary stressed: "The armed Arab people fully understand that, under the current circumstances, unless they persist in a long-term armed struggle, they will not be able to restore their rights."

The commentary condemned U.S. imperialism for constantly plotting conspiracies and launching aggressions to oppose the freedom and security of the peoples of various countries, plundering their wealth. The commentary said: "Every day, a series of conspiracies by Washington against the freedom-loving and peace-loving peoples of various countries are being exposed."

The commentary pointed out: "The United States' support for Zionist bandits exposes the existence of an evil alliance between them. The United States' determination to make this deal to sell 'Phantom' aircraft clearly shows that it is inciting Israel to pursue a policy of aggression and expansion." The commentary said: "Israel is nothing more than a military base planted by the United States in the heart of the Arab homeland to strike at the increasingly powerful Arab liberation movement and plunder Arab wealth."

It has been previously reported that U.S. imperialist leader Johnson, in order to intensify the aggression against the Arab people, on October 9th publicly announced that he had authorized U.S. Secretary of State Rusk to hold "negotiations" with the Israeli authorities regarding the provision of a batch of U.S. fighter-bombers to Israel.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 14th, Nablus news: On October 13th, several hundred Arab female students held a demonstration and march in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus to protest against the aggression of the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, in occupying Arab land and persecuting the Arab people.

Recently, the Israeli occupation authorities, feeling anxious about the extensive guerrilla warfare waged by the Palestinian guerrillas in the West Bank, have intensified their suppression measures. Since October 9th, they have blown up some Arab houses with explosives in Hebron and arrested and imprisoned over 400 Arabs in Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem.

The crimes of the Israeli aggressors have aroused great indignation among the Arab residents of the West Bank. In Nablus, Arab female students marched in a queue on the streets, chanting slogans and holding placards with the words "We do not surrender. We do not emigrate. We do not yield to the occupiers." When the demonstrators marched to the gates of the Nablus prison, they chanted slogans supporting the Palestinian people's struggle to liberate their homeland. In this prison, the Israeli occupation authorities, on the charge of participating in the Palestinian guerrillas, have imprisoned about 350 Palestinians.

At that time, the Israeli occupation authorities brazenly dispatched a large number of troops to suppress the demonstration. However, the demonstrators, despite the aggressors' gunfire suppression, continued to march in the streets.

According to reports, in Nablus, three schools went on strike to protest against Israel's crimes, and in other towns on the West Bank, thirty schools are also preparing to go on strike.

Recently, in the occupied Gaza, Arab female students distributed leaflets opposing Israel's occupation. Thirty female students were arrested by the Israeli occupation army.

    伊拉克报纸谴责联合国策划所谓中东问题提案
    联合国侵犯阿拉伯权利的新阴谋必遭失败
    被占领的约旦河西岸纳布卢斯市阿拉伯女学生示威反对以色列侵略
    新华社巴格达十一日电　伊拉克《共和国报》十日发表评论指出，目前正在联合国大会策划的关于中东问题的新提案，是帝国主义对阿拉伯人民的新阴谋。
    据报道，所谓关于中东问题的新提案，目的是要把以色列侵略部队在去年六月侵略战争中霸占的大片阿拉伯土地置于联合国的控制下，企图使美国侵略阿拉伯土地的工具“以色列”的存在合法化，扑灭巴勒斯坦游击队在那里开展的反对美帝和以色列犹太复国主义的武装斗争的熊熊烈火。
    评论强调指出：“阿拉伯民族已经发现，他们解放被夺去的土地的真正道路，是他们在被占领区内的突击队先锋组织所进行的武装斗争。”
    评论说：中东问题是中东人民的问题、斗争的问题和自决的问题。“人民的问题和斗争的问题决不是关在屋子里就解决得了的。解决这些问题的所在地是战场。”
    评论最后说，联合国侵犯阿拉伯权利的新阴谋，必然会遭到象以前的一切可疑的计划一样的下场。
    据新华社巴格达十四日电　伊拉克通讯社十三日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义进一步推行侵略阿拉伯人民的政策、准备向它的侵略工具以色列供应一批战斗轰炸机的罪行。评论强调说：“拿起武器的阿拉伯人民完全懂得，在目前情况下，除非坚持长期的武装斗争，他们就不能恢复自己的权利。”
    评论谴责美帝国主义不断策划阴谋和发动侵略，来反对各国人民的自由和安全、掠夺他们的财富。评论说：“每天，都有华盛顿反对爱好自由与和平的各国人民的一系列阴谋被揭露出来。”
    评论指出：“美国支持犹太复国主义匪徒，暴露了它们之间存在着邪恶的联盟。美国决心做这笔出售‘鬼怪式’飞机的交易，确凿地说明它怂恿以色列推行侵略和扩张的政策。”评论说：“以色列只不过是美国安插在阿拉伯家园心脏地区、用以打击日益壮大的阿拉伯解放运动和掠夺阿拉伯财富的军事基地而已。”
    前已报道，美帝国主义头子约翰逊为了加紧侵略阿拉伯人民，九日曾经公开宣布，他已授权美国国务卿腊斯克，同以色列当局举行关于向以色列提供一批美国战斗轰炸机的“谈判”。
    新华社开罗十四日电　纳布卢斯消息：几百名阿拉伯女学生十三日在被占领的约旦河西岸的纳布卢斯市举行示威游行，抗议美帝国主义侵略工具以色列占领阿拉伯土地和迫害阿拉伯人的罪行。
    最近，以色列占领当局对巴勒斯坦游击队在约旦河西岸广泛开展游击战争感到惶惶不安，加紧采取了镇压措施。自从十月九日以来，它在希布伦城用炸药炸毁了一些阿拉伯人的房屋，并且在耶路撒冷、希布伦和伯利恒逮捕和监禁了四百多名阿拉伯人。
    以色列侵略者的这一罪行，激起了约旦河西岸阿拉伯居民的极大愤怒。在纳布卢斯市，阿拉伯女学生在大街上列队示威游行，她们高呼口号，举着标语牌，上面写着“我们不投降。我们不移居。我们不向占领者屈服。”示威群众游行到纳布卢斯监狱门前时，高呼支持巴勒斯坦人民为解放他们的家园而进行的斗争的口号。在这个监狱里，以色列占领当局以参加巴勒斯坦游击队的“罪名”，关押着大约三百五十名巴勒斯坦人。
    当时，以色列占领当局悍然出动大批军队前往镇压。但是，示威者不顾侵略者开枪镇压，继续在街上游行。
    据报道，在纳布卢斯有三所学校罢课，抗议以色列的罪行，约旦河西岸的其他市镇有三十所学校也正在准备罢课。
    最近，在被占领的加沙，阿拉伯女学生散发传单，反对以色列的占领。有三十名女学生，遭到以色列占领军的逮捕。
