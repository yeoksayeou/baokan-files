The Albanian government economic delegation, led by Deputy Prime Minister of the Albanian Council of Ministers Adil Charchani, accompanied by Vice Minister of Foreign Trade of China Li Qiang, concluded their visit to Guangzhou today. They departed by airplane for Hangzhou this morning.

The delegation arrived in Guangzhou by special plane on the 22nd for a visit. At the airport, they were warmly welcomed by over a thousand revolutionary masses of Guangzhou, along with leaders from the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees, and the Guangzhou garrison of the People's Liberation Army.

On the evening of the 23rd, the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees held a banquet to welcome the Albanian comrades. Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Yan Zhongchuan and Comrade Charchani both spoke at the banquet, expressing their wishes for the further development of revolutionary friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Albania. Comrade Yan Zhongchuan praised the heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, for their adherence to the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line and their vigorous revolutionary movement, achieving brilliant victories. He highly evaluated Albania's revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact controlled by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. Comrade Charchani congratulated the brilliant victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. He also introduced the achievements made by Albania through a series of revolutionary measures. Comrade Charchani condemned the Brezhnev-Kosygin Soviet revisionist renegade clique and their lackeys, who, under the notorious banner of the Warsaw Pact, launched a typical fascist aggression against Czechoslovakia. He said that the revolutionary peoples of the world are friends of the Albanian people. The seven hundred million heroic Chinese people and the Albanian people stand shoulder to shoulder. The Albanian people have heightened their revolutionary vigilance, strengthened their preparedness, with one hand holding a gun and the other a pickaxe, ready to annihilate any enemy that dares to invade.

Leaders from the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees, including Bai Ping, Liang Xiuzhen, and Sun Yiwu, as well as representatives from the Guangzhou garrison of the People's Liberation Army and Comrade Li Qiang, attended the banquet.

During their stay in Guangzhou, the Albanian comrades visited the site of the "Peasant Movement Training Institute" established by Chairman Mao in his early years, the 1968 Autumn China Export Commodities Fair currently held in Guangzhou, and the Guangzhou Asbestos Factory. They also watched the revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women."
