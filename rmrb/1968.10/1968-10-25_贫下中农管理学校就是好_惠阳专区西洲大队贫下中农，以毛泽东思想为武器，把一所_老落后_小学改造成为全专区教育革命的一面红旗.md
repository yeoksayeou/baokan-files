The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xizhou Production Brigade in Huicheng Special District, Guangdong Province, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have transformed a notoriously backward primary school into a banner of educational revolution for the entire district.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 24th: The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xizhou Production Brigade in Xintang Commune, Zengcheng County, Guangdong Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, began managing Xizhou Primary School in September last year, ending the domination of the school by bourgeois intellectuals. Over the past year, the poor and lower-middle peasants, in the process of managing Xizhou Primary School, have followed Chairman Mao's series of instructions on educational revolution, firmly emphasizing proletarian politics, vigorously reforming the old educational system, and transforming this notoriously backward school into a banner of educational revolution for the entire Huicheng Special District.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the bourgeois intellectuals who dominated Xizhou Primary School and a handful of Nationalist Party remnants who had infiltrated the school had been following the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, doing everything possible to exclude the children of poor and lower-middle peasants from enrolling in school, while opening the doors wide for the children of landlords and rich peasants. According to the calculations of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xizhou Production Brigade, out of the 610 households of poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire brigade, only 51 had graduated from this primary school and gone on to middle school or university over the past decade, an average of one person per 11 households; while out of 32 households of landlords and rich peasants, 34 of their children had gone on to middle school or university, an average of more than one person per household. The third production team had five middle school students, four of whom were children of landlords and rich peasants; the sixth production team was entirely composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, yet not a single one had become a middle school student. Some children of poor and lower-middle peasants who had entered Xizhou Primary School were labeled as "stupid," "disrespectful to teachers," and "disruptive," and were punished with "repeating a grade" or "expulsion." Over the years, 80 children of poor and lower-middle peasants had been held back, and 27 had been expelled. Because this school had long been dominated by bourgeois intellectuals and had followed the revisionist educational line, some poor and lower-middle peasant children who had originally loved labor and the collective were, after entering the school, poisoned by the revisionist educational line and became lazy and unwilling to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants after graduation.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xizhou Production Brigade had long been dissatisfied with the above situation. Therefore, they decided, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "in this cultural revolution, we must thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools," to manage the school themselves. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, all the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade established the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School Management Committee and formed an educational revolution leadership small group consisting of brigade revolutionary cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, demobilized soldiers, and revolutionary teachers and students. They entered the school in September last year and took over Xizhou Primary School from the bourgeois intellectuals.

Since the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xizhou Production Brigade began managing Xizhou Primary School, they have emphasized proletarian politics in everything, using great Mao Zedong Thought to guide, criticize, promote, and transform everything, and seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the key to educational reform is the teachers" and insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to reform the school's teaching staff. They first mobilized the masses to thoroughly clean up the class ranks and root out a handful of bad elements who had infiltrated the teaching staff. They held Mao Zedong Thought study classes and, together with revolutionary teachers and students, systematically criticized the black goods of "reading books to become officials," "academics first," and "grades first" promoted by China's Khrushchev. They also studied Chairman Mao's works together with the teachers, labored together, and engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. This raised the political awareness of many teachers, made them humble, and changed their thoughts and feelings.

Previously, this school had been detached from proletarian politics, the masses, and production. Students learned mathematics but did not understand agricultural accounting; they learned trigonometry and geometry but did not know how to measure fields and fishponds. To change this "three-detachment" situation of the school, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students together boldly reformed the old textbooks, courses, and teaching methods. They made studying and applying Chairman Mao's works the main course for students and also compiled textbooks that emphasized Mao Zedong Thought, closely linked to class struggle, production struggle, scientific experimentation, and suited to local conditions. Poor and lower-middle peasants personally went to the school to teach class struggle education courses, and many revolutionary teachers and students were deeply educated. Courses on rice cultivation, banana planting, electrical knowledge, tractor driving, and water pump operation were all taught by poor and lower-middle peasants with practical experience. Some agricultural knowledge courses were taught by poor and lower-middle peasants leading students directly to the fields or banana gardens to labor and explain, and students felt that the teaching was good, understandable, and very satisfying. In addition, they arranged for students to participate in collective labor in the production teams for two days each week, organically linking school education, social education, and family education.

Since September last year, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xizhou Production Brigade have experienced severe struggles in managing the school. They not only faced the slander and defamation of class enemies but also encountered the stubborn resistance of old habits. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants firmly believed that following Chairman Mao is victory! They used Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution as their weapon and led the revolutionary teachers and students of the school to firmly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "primary schools with attached junior middle school classes, this method is still a good method, advanced experience" and, without spending a penny of state funds and without increasing the number of teachers, self-reliantly established an attached junior middle school class, enrolling 55 children of poor and lower-middle peasants at once, exceeding the total number of poor and lower-middle peasant children who had entered middle school in the past 18 years. When breaking away from the old educational system and teaching methods, some old poor peasants with sickles at their waists went to the lectern to teach, and teachers went to the fields barefoot to labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Students formed groups of three or five to form anti-revisionist struggle small groups and often brought class enemies to struggle against. Seeing this situation, a handful of class enemies were again furious and slandered that the poor and lower-middle peasants had turned the school into something that did not look like a "regular" school. The poor and lower-middle peasants responded loudly: "Students not only learn literature but also learn industry, agriculture, military affairs, and criticize the bourgeoisie. This is the fundamental path for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause pointed out by Chairman Mao. Your so-called 'regularization' cultivates revisionist seedlings. Your revisionist goods are completely finished, and we will definitely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao!" The more the class enemies opposed, the more the poor and lower-middle peasants led the revolutionary teachers and students to actively and boldly carry out educational reforms.

Now they are further launching a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school according to Chairman Mao's teachings and striding forward on the great road of proletarian educational revolution.

    贫下中农管理学校就是好
    惠阳专区西洲大队贫下中农，以毛泽东思想为武器，把一所“老落后”小学改造成为全专区教育革命的一面红旗
    据新华社广州二十四日电　广东省增城县新塘公社西洲大队的贫下中农，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，从去年九月开始管理西洲小学，结束了资产阶级知识分子统治这所学校的局面。一年来，贫下中农在管理西洲小学的过程中，遵照毛主席关于教育革命的一系列指示，坚定地突出无产阶级政治，大力改革旧的教育制度，把这个出了名的老落后学校，改造成为惠阳专区教育革命的一面红旗。
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，统治西洲小学的资产阶级知识分子和混入学校的一小撮国民党残渣余孽，一直按照中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线办事，千方百计地排斥贫下中农子女入学，而对地主、富农的子女则大开方便之门。据西洲大队的贫下中农计算，全大队六百一十户贫下中农的子女，十多年来从这个小学毕业后升入中学和大学的只有五十一人，平均十一户才有一人；而三十二户地主、富农，他们的子女就有三十四人升入中学、大学，平均一户有一人多。第三生产队有五个中学生，四个是地主、富农的子女；第六生产队全部是贫下中农，却连一个中学生也没有。有些贫下中农子女进了西洲小学，就被加上“笨蛋”、“不尊敬教师”、“不守纪律”等罪名，而受到“留级”或“开除学籍”的处分。西洲小学历年来有八十个贫下中农子女被留级，二十七人被开除学籍。由于这个学校长期受资产阶级知识分子统治，推行修正主义教育路线，一些本来热爱劳动、热爱集体的贫下中农子女，进了学校以后，在修正主义教育路线的毒害下，反而变得好逸恶劳，有的人毕业后还不愿意在农村为贫下中农服务。
    对于上述情况，西洲大队的贫下中农早已不满。于是他们遵照毛主席“在这场文化大革命中，必须彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象”的教导，决定自己去管理这所学校。全大队的贫下中农在人民解放军帮助下，成立了贫下中农办学委员会，并且组成了有大队革命干部、贫下中农、复员军人、革命师生参加的教育革命领导小组，于去年九月开进了学校，从资产阶级知识分子手里接管了西洲小学。
    西洲大队贫下中农从管理西洲小学以来，处处突出无产阶级政治，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切，批判一切，推动一切，改造一切，认真搞好斗、批、改。他们遵照毛主席“教改的问题，主要是教员问题”的教导，坚持用毛泽东思想改造学校教师队伍。他们首先放手发动群众，认真清理阶级队伍，挖出了混进教师队伍里的一小撮坏人。他们举办了毛泽东思想学习班，和革命师生一起，系统批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“读书做官论”、“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”等修正主义黑货。他们还和教员一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，一起斗私批修。使不少教员提高了无产阶级的政治觉悟，放下了架子，思想感情发生了变化。
    过去，这个学校脱离无产阶级政治、脱离群众、脱离生产。学生学了数学，不懂得农业会计，学了三角、几何，不懂得丈量田亩、鱼塘。为了改变学校这种“三脱离”的状况，贫下中农和革命师生一起，大胆改革了旧的教材、课程和旧的教学方法。他们把活学活用毛主席著作列为学生的主课，同时编写了突出毛泽东思想，紧密结合阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验而又适合当地特点的教材。贫下中农亲自登上学校讲台给学生上阶级教育课，许多革命师生听了受到了深刻的教育。水稻栽培、香蕉种植、电工知识、拖拉机驾驶、抽水机使用等农业知识课，都由有实践经验的贫下中农去主讲，有些农业知识课程由贫下中农带领学生，直接到田间或香蕉园里边劳动边讲解，学生反映讲得好，听得懂，非常满意。此外，他们还安排学生每周有两天时间参加生产队集体劳动，把学校教育、社会教育和家庭教育三方面有机地联系起来。
    西洲大队贫下中农从去年九月管理学校以来，经历了严重的斗争。他们不但遭到阶级敌人的诬蔑和诽谤，也遇到旧的习惯势力的顽强抵抗，但是贫下中农坚信：紧跟毛主席就是胜利！他们以毛主席关于教育革命的指示为武器，坚决地领导学校的革命师生进行斗、批、改。他们遵照毛主席“小学校附设初中班，这种办法还是好办法，先进经验”的教导，不花国家一分钱，没有增加教员，自力更生地办起了附设初中班，一次就招收了五十五名贫下中农子女入学，超过了过去十八年贫下中农子女入中学人数的总和。在破除旧教育制度和教学方法的时候，有些老贫农腰间带镰刀走上讲台，教员光着脚板到田间和贫下中农一起劳动，学生三五成群组成批修战斗小组，经常把阶级敌人揪来斗争。一小撮阶级敌人见此情况，又气急败坏地诬蔑贫下中农把学校办得不象个“正规”学校的样子。贫下中农响亮地回答说：“学生不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军和批判资产阶级，这是毛主席给我们指出的培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本道路。你们的所谓‘正规化’，培养的是修正主义的苗子，你们那套修正主义货色彻底完蛋了，我们走毛主席指引的道路是走定了！”阶级敌人越是反对，贫下中农越是领导革命师生积极地、大刀阔斧地进行教育改革。
    现在他们正在按照毛主席的教导在学校中进一步掀起斗、批、改的新高潮，在无产阶级教育革命的大道上阔步前进。
