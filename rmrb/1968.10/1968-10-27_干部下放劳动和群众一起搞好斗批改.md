The Zhejiang Hemp Textile Mill Revolutionary Committee, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, sent nearly 90% of its cadres to work in the countryside. After participating in labor, the cadres, together with the workers, studied Chairman Mao's works, worked together, discovered unreasonable regulations, and promptly incorporated the workers' opinions to carry out reforms.

	The recent instructions of Chairman Mao point out: "A large number of cadres going to the countryside to work is an excellent opportunity for them to re-learn. Except for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. In-service cadres should also go to the countryside in batches." The workers and cadres of the Zhejiang Hemp Textile Mill, following Chairman Mao's instructions, sent a large number of cadres to the countryside, which strongly promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the entire mill.

	After establishing the Revolutionary Committee, the Zhejiang Hemp Textile Mill faced a prominent issue: how to reform the old institutions that do not adapt to the socialist economic base and achieve the revolutionization of the organs. Some people believed that they should carry out thorough revolutionary spirit, cut down the old institutions with a big knife, send cadres to the countryside to work, and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation with the workers. Some people believed that if everyone goes down, how can the struggle, criticism, and transformation be carried out well. The mill's Revolutionary Committee believed that streamlining the organs and sending cadres to the countryside is an important part of the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Therefore, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "breaking first," leaving only 28 cadres on duty, and sending nearly 90% of the cadres to the countryside to work. Practice has proven that this approach strongly promoted the deep development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	Previously, this mill had 14 departments and 390-plus full-time staff members. They went to work and study every day and also carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. However, they were detached from production labor and the worker masses, their minds were empty, and they changed and changed, but they could not get out of the old tracks and old systems. In many aspects, they still used old methods, severely dampened the workers' enthusiasm, and affected production. Now, when workers encounter problems in production, they can solve them by discussing with the technical staff who have come down to work together.

	Will the participation of cadres in labor weaken the leadership of the struggle, criticism, and transformation? The Zhejiang Hemp Textile Mill Revolutionary Committee also had concerns at the beginning. Practice has proven that it not only will not weaken the leadership but also strengthen the leadership of the struggle, criticism, and transformation. During a previous period, the class enemy blew a strong wind of anarchism, seriously affecting production and greatly hindering the progress of the struggle, criticism, and transformation. At that time, the Revolutionary Committee also focused on class struggle, but the cadres were floating above, only making general calls, and still could not grasp the key points. Some even wrongly blamed the masses for being backward. After the committee chairman went down to the workshop, he conducted investigations and research with the workers and quickly discovered a historical counter-revolutionary who had infiltrated the worker ranks, using two-faced tactics to incite anarchist thoughts and sabotage production. He then studied with everyone Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle," mobilized the masses to expose and struggle against this counter-revolutionary, greatly raising the masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, quickly stopping the anarchist wind, and removing obstacles to the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	After the cadres went to the countryside to work, their standpoint shifted to the side of the worker masses. They studied Chairman Mao's works and worked with the workers, discovering that many of the original regulations and systems were serving the bourgeois "authority," binding the workers' hands, and even sabotaging production. A bourgeois technical "authority" used eight years to reform a so-called high-speed warping machine. This machine, after being fully wound with hemp yarn, weighed over 500 jin. Originally, without reform, workers had to load and unload 40 times a day, already very tired. However, after this bourgeois technical "authority" reform, they had to load and unload 80 times a day, making it impossible to use. The workers proposed further reform opinions, but this bourgeois technical "authority," for the sake of his own fame and profit, did not care about the workers' lives and insisted on promoting it. Many department staff members believed in "experts" and did not heed the workers' opinions. After the cadres went to the countryside to work and sweated with the workers, their hearts also connected. At this time, they deeply felt that the workers' opinions were reasonable. Many technical staff members actively worked with the workers to further reform this machine, not only improving production efficiency but also greatly reducing labor intensity and further mobilizing the workers' enthusiasm. This incident made them further see the serious harm of "expert management" and aroused their hatred for the revisionist management line. They, together with the workers, united in their hatred, systematically exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders who had pushed the revisionist management line for more than a decade, promoting the deep development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	After the cadres of the Zhejiang Hemp Textile Mill participated in labor, they became both "officials" and "common people." The cadre team's ideological appearance underwent profound changes, the relationship between cadres and the masses improved, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation reached a new high, with production rising month by month. Currently, the entire mill's cadres and workers are united, with a unified understanding, unified steps, and unified actions, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, striding forward on the road of revolutionization!

    干部下放劳动和群众一起搞好斗批改
    浙江麻纺织厂革委会遵照毛主席的教导，把将近百分之九十的干部下放劳动。干部参加劳动后，和职工一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，发现不合理的规章制度，随时吸收工人的意见进行改革
    本报讯　毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”浙江麻纺织厂的广大职工和干部遵照毛主席这一指示，大批干部下放劳动，有力地推动了全厂的斗、批、改。
    浙江麻纺织厂建立革命委员会后，面临的一个突出问题是，如何改革不适应社会主义经济基础的旧机构，实现机关革命化。有的人认为，应该发扬彻底革命精神，大刀阔斧砍掉旧机构，干部下放劳动，和工人一道搞斗、批、改。有的人认为，人都下去了，斗、批、改怎么能搞得好。厂革委会认为，精简机构、下放干部本身就是斗、批、改的重要内容。因此，他们遵照毛主席关于“破字当头”的教导，除留下二十八个干部值班外，把近百分之九十的干部下放劳动。实践证明，这样做，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。
    过去，这个厂有十四个科室，三百九十多个脱产人员。他们天天上班、学习，也搞斗、批、改。但是，他们脱离生产劳动，脱离工人群众，头脑空虚，改来改去，还是跳不出旧轨道、老制度，甚至在许多方面，还沿用老办法，严重地挫伤了工人的积极性，影响了生产。现在，工人在生产中遇到问题，同下来一起劳动的技术员一商量就解决了。
    干部参加劳动后，会不会削弱对斗、批、改的领导？浙江麻纺织厂革委会开始时也有顾虑。实践证明，不但不会削弱领导，而且加强了对斗、批、改的领导。前段时间，阶级敌人刮起了一股无政府主义妖风，严重影响了生产，极大地妨害了斗、批、改的进行。当时革委会也抓阶级斗争，但是干部浮在上面，只作一般号召，还是抓不到点子上，有的人还错误地埋怨群众落后。革委会主任下到车间后，和工人一起调查研究，很快发现了一个混入工人队伍的历史反革命分子，耍弄两面派手法，煽动无政府主义思潮，破坏生产的情况。他就和大家一道学习毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，广泛发动群众揪斗了这个反革命分子，大大提高了群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，很快煞住了无政府主义妖风，扫除了斗、批、改的障碍。
    干部下放劳动，立足点移到工人群众这边来了。他们同工人一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，就发现原来的那些规章制度，很多是为资产阶级“权威”服务的，束缚了工人的手脚，甚至破坏了生产。有个资产阶级技术“权威”用了八年时间，改了一台所谓高速整经机。这种机器转轴卷满了麻纱后有五百多斤。本来没有改革时，工人一天要装卸四十次，已经十分劳累，可是经过这个资产阶级技术“权威”改革之后，一天反而要装卸八十次，根本无法使用。工人们提出了进一步改革的意见，但是这个资产阶级技术“权威”为了自己出名得利，根本不顾工人死活，硬要全面推广。不少科室人员迷信“专家”，也不理会工人的意见。干部下放劳动后，同工人在一起流汗，心也连在一起了，这时，他们才深刻体会到工人的意见是合理的。许多技术员就积极和工人一起进一步改革了这台机器，不仅提高了生产效率，而且大大减轻了劳动强度，进一步调动了工人的积极性。这件事，使他们进一步看到“专家治厂”的严重危害，激发了对修正主义办厂路线的仇恨。他们与工人一起，同仇敌忾，系统地揭发批判了建厂十多年来一小撮走资派推行修正主义建厂路线的滔天罪行，推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。
    浙江麻纺织厂广大干部参加劳动后，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，干部队伍的思想面貌发生了深刻的变化，干群关系得到了改善，斗、批、改高潮一浪高过一浪，生产逐月上升。目前，全厂干部、工人团结一致，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命化的道路上阔步前进！
