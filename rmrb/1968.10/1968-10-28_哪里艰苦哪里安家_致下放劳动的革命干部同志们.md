	Where There Is Hardship, There Is Our Home
	– To Revolutionary Cadres Sent for Labor

	Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres going for labor, revolutionary cadres have raised a magnificent battle cry: "Where there is hardship, there is our home."

	They have put their words into action, not just talking big. Look! They have walked out of their offices, stepped out of their small family circles, cast aside personal desires, packed their bags, and with heads held high, marched to the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements, embarking on the revolutionary journey of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	"Where there is hardship, there is our home" is the worldview of proletarian revolutionaries. "The proletariat not only seeks to liberate itself but also to liberate all of humanity." For the liberation of class brothers and for the liberation of all humanity, we must not fear hardship, take hardship as joy, have great aspirations, and consider the world our home.

	"Where there is hardship, there is our home" is a powerful critique of the counter-revolutionary revisionist cadre line of the Chinese Khrushchev. What is this "going down to come up," "laboring to become an 'official'" theory of revolution? What is this "eating bitterness to become a superior person" theory of bitterness followed by sweetness? What is this idea that cadres going for labor is an "extra burden," a "punishment"? All of these are ideologies of the bourgeoisie and must be thrown into the dustbin of history. We are not afraid of the sky, not afraid of the earth, not afraid of any hardship; we take hardship as joy, endless joy, take hardship as honor, supreme honor. We will fight against heaven, fight against the earth, fight against selfishness, criticize revisionism, have no enemies but ourselves, have ourselves but no enemies, and will not rest until we achieve complete victory!

	"Where there is hardship, there is our home" is to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of proletarian hard work. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Our state cadres, writers and artists, teachers, and scientific researchers should, as far as possible, use every opportunity to get close to the workers and peasants.... Some people can stay there for a long time, for example, two or three years, or even longer, living there, which is called 'settling down.'" In the past, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary cadres did just that. In the days of war, they were not afraid of hardship or death, going wherever they were needed, sharing the same fate and breath with the laboring people, fish and water intertwined, flesh and blood connected. This tradition we must never forget!

	"Where there is hardship, there is our home" versus "where there is comfort, there is hiding" reflects the struggle between two fundamentally opposed worldviews. "Where there is hardship, there is our home" is the worldview of the proletariat. "Where there is comfort, there is hiding" is the worldview of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes seek personal enjoyment as the highest goal of life. They always think only of their own or their family's private interests. "Where there is hardship, there is our home" is something they dare not even think of. However, for the proletariat, going for labor, suffering for the revolution, is a matter of course. Because in their hearts, they always have the 700 million people of China, and the 3 billion people of the world.

	We believe that the broad revolutionary cadres, who have undergone profound tempering in the Cultural Revolution, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, will surely eagerly throw themselves into collective productive labor, consciously criticize and repudiate revisionism, and make new contributions to the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	"Treading over green mountains, one does not grow old; the scenery here is uniquely beautiful." Broad revolutionary cadres, let us stride forward on the road of labor and revolutionization guided by Chairman Mao, and march on forever!

    哪里艰苦哪里安家
    ——致下放劳动的革命干部同志们
    广大革命干部在毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示的指引下，提出了一个豪迈的战斗口号：“哪里艰苦哪里安家”。
    他们说到做到，不放空炮。看！他们一个个走出了办公大楼，跳出了小家庭圈子，扔下了私心杂念，背起了行装，昂首阔步地奔赴三大革命运动的第一线，踏上了同工农兵群众相结合的革命征途。
      “哪里艰苦哪里安家”是无产阶级革命者的人生观。“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。”为了阶级兄弟的解放，为了全人类的解放，我们就要不怕吃苦，以苦为乐，胸怀大志，四海为家。
    “哪里艰苦哪里安家”，是对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义干部路线的有力的批判。什么“下去为了上来，劳动为了做‘官’”的“革命做官论”；什么“吃得苦中苦，方为人上人”的“先苦后甜”论；什么干部下放劳动是“额外负担”，是“一种体罚”，等等，统统都是资产阶级的意识形态，统统都应扫进历史垃圾箱。我们就是不怕天，不怕地，不怕任何艰难困苦；我们以艰苦为乐，其乐无穷，以艰苦为荣，无上光荣。我们要与天斗，与地斗，斗私，批修，有敌无我，有我无敌，不获全胜，誓不罢休！
    “哪里艰苦哪里安家”，就是发扬无产阶级艰苦奋斗的革命传统。毛主席早就教导我们：“我们的国家机关工作人员、文学家、艺术家、教员和科学研究人员，都应该尽可能地利用各种机会去接近工人农民。……还有些人可以长期住下去，比如两年、三年，或者更长一些时间，就在那里生活，叫做‘安家落户’。”当年，在毛泽东思想哺育下的广大革命干部就是这样做的。在战火纷飞的年代里，他们不怕苦，不怕死，哪里需要到哪里去，和劳动人民同命运，共呼吸，鱼水相依，血肉相连。这个传统我们永远不能忘记！
    “哪里艰苦哪里安家”，还是“哪里舒服哪里躲”，反映了两种根本对立的世界观的斗争。“哪里艰苦哪里安家”，是无产阶级的世界观。“哪里舒服哪里躲”，是资产阶级的世界观。资产阶级和一切剥削阶级都是以追求个人享受作为生活的最高目的。他们处处想到的只是自己或一家人的私利。“哪里艰苦哪里安家”是他们想都不敢想的事。然而，在无产阶级看来，下放劳动，为革命吃苦，这是天经地义的事。因为他们心中时时有着七亿人口，有着世界三十亿人口的大多数。
    我们相信：在文化大革命中受到了深刻锻炼的广大革命干部，在毛主席的最新指示的光辉照耀下，一定会踊跃地投身到集体生产劳动中去，自觉地斗私批修，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业不断地作出新的贡献。
    “踏遍青山人未老，风景这边独好。”广大的革命干部同志们，让我们迈开大步，在毛主席指引的劳动化、革命化的道路上永远前进吧！
