Workers and PLA comrades learn from each other, cooperate closely, unite as one, and strive to improve the struggle-criticism-transformation of the superstructure. The workers and PLA comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the former Ministry of Culture are continuously improving their political consciousness in the struggle.

The workers and PLA comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the former Ministry of Culture, coming from various workplaces, have faced extremely sharp and complex class struggles since their arrival. In this situation, the leaders of the workers and PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team unanimously believe that to lead the struggle-criticism-transformation of the former Ministry of Culture, it is necessary to fully exert the leading role of the working class; at the same time, they must learn from each other, promote each other, cooperate closely, strengthen unity, and fight the enemy together. They must continuously improve their political consciousness and temper the propaganda team into a fighting collective that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao in the great storms of class struggle. For this purpose, after the propaganda team entered the former Ministry of Culture, the worker comrades and the military comrades began to engage in mutual learning activities.

The military leaders regard learning from the working class as an important measure to promote the Four Good Campaign to a new level under new conditions, strengthen the construction of the grassroots level of the army, and promote the revolutionization of thought. The military comrades continuously organize everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "the working class is the leading class" and "the working class has the most foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." They emphasize the great achievements of the working class in the Cultural Revolution, propagate the glorious traditions and excellent style of the working class, and make every military comrade firmly believe in the leadership of the working class in thought and support the leadership of the working class without hesitation in action. They resolutely become the strong backing of the working class, guarantee the leading position of the working class, and cooperate with the working class to improve the struggle-criticism-transformation of the superstructure. Therefore, the military comrades always take the workers as their example, and everyone uses the thoughts and actions of the worker comrades to examine and check themselves. They insist on writing notes on learning from the working class, and each class and platoon holds weekly discussions to exchange experiences of learning from the working class and sets up a column for learning from the working class. The worker comrades from the Jingxi Gate Coal Mine in Mentougou, Beijing, have relatively long work experience. They have experienced both the old and new societies and have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao, the clearest class stance, and the richest experience in class struggle. The military comrades, with the spirit of being willing to be little students, invite the old workers to introduce their experiences in fighting against the enemy and their advanced deeds in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and promoting production during the Cultural Revolution, thereby promoting their own thought revolutionization. The military comrades say: "We learn from the working class to be as loyal to Chairman Mao as the working class, and to carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution." The comrades in Class Five have relatively low cultural levels and think it is difficult to deal with intellectuals. Class leader Hou Guoren encourages everyone to take the working class as an example, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory. An old worker in the propaganda team said: "Compared to intellectuals, we don't rely on cultural level, nor do we rely on parroting. We rely entirely on our loyalty to Chairman Mao. With Mao Zedong Thought, we are not afraid of any difficulties." The old worker's words greatly inspired the soldiers in Class Five, and they decided to learn from the fearless spirit of the working class and overcome all difficulties.

The worker comrades also deeply feel that the PLA studies Chairman Mao's works the best and uses them the most effectively. Learning from the military comrades can continuously improve political consciousness and fully exert the leading role. They believe that learning from the PLA is fundamentally about being like the PLA, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works everywhere, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and focusing on grassroots construction. For this purpose, the worker comrades learn from the military's organization, organizing the worker comrades into classes, platoons, and companies, and inviting military comrades to share their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works and their deeds in propagating and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries." The military comrades, in order to support the leadership of the working class in political thought, while humbly learning from the working class, also actively introduce the PLA's experiences in emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, promoting the "Three-Eight" style, and carrying out the Four Good Campaign to the worker comrades. Under the enthusiastic help of the military comrades, the worker propaganda team also established the Four Good Monthly Inspection System and carried out the Four Good Campaign.

The workers and PLA comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the former Ministry of Culture have forged a fighting friendship in the struggle. When encountering problems, they consult Chairman Mao's works together; when facing difficulties, they study strategies together; when achieving successes, they encourage each other; and when there are shortcomings in work, they analyze the causes together. They unify their understanding, steps, and actions in everything with Mao Zedong Thought, forming a strong fighting collective that leaves no gaps for class enemies. When the propaganda team first entered the former Ministry of Culture, some comrades felt impatient facing this "difficult unit" and the problem of how to re-educate intellectuals. Worker propaganda team leader Zheng Shuangjun and political instructor Li Zhuanyou noticed this problem and immediately analyzed the causes and studied measures with the military leaders. They proposed the method of holding a short-term Mao Zedong Thought study class for the propaganda team members. The military leaders actively supported this and immediately opened a short-term study class within the propaganda team, carrying out the "frontline training" activity. The worker comrades and military comrades studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the party's policies on intellectuals while summarizing and exchanging work experiences and lessons, discussing their understanding and finding gaps, learning and fighting together, quickly improving the political consciousness and policy level of the team members, and gradually overcoming the impatient mood.

    工人和解放军同志互相学习密切配合团结一致努力搞好上层建筑的斗批改
    进驻旧文化部的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队战士在斗争中不断提高政治觉悟
    本报讯　进驻旧文化部首都工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的队员，互相学习、团结战斗，充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，共同为搞好文化部的斗批改而努力。
    首都工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们，来自不同的工作岗位，他们进驻旧文化部以后，面临着极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。在这种情况下，工人和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的领导同志一致认为：要领导好旧文化部的斗批改，必须充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用；同时还要互相学习，互相促进，密切配合，加强团结，共同对敌，不断提高政治觉悟，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里把宣传队锻炼成无限忠于毛主席的战斗集体。为此，宣传队进驻旧文化部后，工人队员和部队同志就开展互相学习的活动。
    部队领导同志把向工人阶级学习看做是在新的条件下，把四好连队运动推向新水平，加强部队基层建设，促进思想革命化的重要措施。部队同志不断组织大家学习毛主席关于“工人阶级是领导阶级”、“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性”的伟大教导，大讲特讲工人阶级在文化大革命中的丰功伟绩，大力宣扬工人阶级的光荣传统和优良作风，使部队每个同志在思想上对工人阶级领导一切坚信不疑，行动上支持工人阶级领导一切毫不犹豫，坚决作工人阶级的坚强后盾，保证工人阶级的领导地位，配合工人阶级搞好上层建筑的斗批改。因此，部队同志处处以工人为榜样，人人用工人同志们的思想和行动对照检查自己，坚持写向工人阶级学习笔记，各班排每周都座谈交流向工人阶级学习的体会，并开办了向工人阶级学习的专栏。进驻旧文化部的京西门头沟煤矿的工人队员，工龄都比较长，他们在旧社会都饱受压迫和剥削。他们经历了新旧两个社会，对毛主席感情最深，阶级立场最鲜明，阶级斗争经验最丰富。部队同志以甘当小学生的精神，请老工人介绍对敌斗争经验，介绍在文化大革命中紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，抓革命促生产的先进事迹，促进自身思想革命化。部队同志说：“我们学习工人阶级，就是要象工人阶级那样，无限忠于毛主席，发扬彻底革命精神。”五班同志们文化水平比较低，认为和知识分子不好打交道。班长侯国恩就鼓励大家以工人阶级为榜样，排除万难，去争取胜利。宣传队中一位老工人说：“和知识分子比起来，咱一不凭文化水平，二不凭鹦鹉嘴，全凭对毛主席的一片忠心。有毛泽东思想，什么困难都不怕。”老工人的话对五班战士鼓舞很大，他们决心学习工人阶级的大无畏精神，战胜一切困难。
    工人同志们也深深体会到：解放军对毛主席著作学得最好，用得最活，向部队同志学习，就能不断提高政治觉悟，充分发挥领导作用。他们认为学习解放军，最根本的就是要象解放军那样，处处活学活用毛主席著作，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，狠抓基层建设。为此，工人同志们学习部队的编制，把工人队员编成班、排、连，并请部队同志介绍学习毛主席著作的体会，以及在“三支”“两军”中宣传、捍卫毛主席革命路线的事迹，来武装自己的头脑。部队同志为了从政治思想上支持工人阶级领导，在虚心向工人阶级学习的同时，也积极把部队突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，开展四好连队运动等经验，介绍给工人同志们。在部队同志热情帮助下，工人宣传队也建立了四好月检查制度，开展了四好连队运动。
    驻旧文化部工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队队员在斗争中结下了战斗友情。遇到问题，一起向毛主席著作请示，碰到困难，一起研究对策，有了成绩，互相勉励，工作中出现了缺点，共同分析原因。他们事事用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，结成了坚强的战斗集体，使阶级敌人无隙可乘。宣传队刚进旧文化部时，少数同志面对着这个“老大难”单位和如何对知识分子进行再教育的问题，产生了急躁情绪。工人宣传队队长郑双军和指导员李占有同志察觉这一问题后，连夜找部队领导同志分析原因，研究措施，提出了举办宣传队员短期毛泽东思想学习班的办法。部队领导同志积极支持，立即在宣传队内部开办了短期学习班，开展了“火线练兵”活动。工人队员和部队同志一边学习毛主席最新指示，学习党对知识分子的各项方针政策，一边互相总结交流工作中的经验教训，一起谈认识、找差距，边学习，边战斗，很快提高了队员的政治觉悟和政策水平，逐步克服了急躁情绪。
