The workers of all ethnic groups at the Karamay Oil Field, a crucial oil base in China, have played a leading role in the proletarian revolution. They have focused on the revolution and vigorously promoted production, leading to significant achievements in the deepening of revolutionary criticism and mass technological innovation and technological revolution. In the first eight months of this year, all drilling, oil extraction, and refining operations in the entire mine have exceeded the planned targets. Production indicators such as trial oil extraction have already completed this year's production plan three months ahead of schedule.

For a long time, a small clique of capitalist roaders in the Karamay Oil Mine have vigorously promoted the revisionist enterprise management and scientific and technological lines of the Chinese Khrushchev, suppressing and obstructing the rationalization proposals and technological innovation activities of the oil workers. This has seriously affected the development of oil field production. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the oil workers of all ethnic groups have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, waged a fierce struggle against the small clique of capitalist roaders, and deeply exposed and criticized the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. The sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism has greatly enhanced the class consciousness and two-line struggle awareness of the broad masses of oil workers, promoting the vigorous development of the technological revolution. From 1967 to the present, the entire mine has implemented more than 350 technological innovations, many of which are major technological innovation projects.

The advanced collective of the oil extraction team at the Third Oil Extraction Factory, which studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, along with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary technical personnel, visited various relevant departments in Karamay. They conducted investigations and research on the geological conditions and oil output of more than 50 oil and water wells. They finally successfully conducted an initial trial of a new oil layer extraction process at well 2397. After the innovation, the daily output of the entire station increased by one and a half times.

In the vigorous technological innovation and technological revolution, the oil workers of all ethnic groups have formed a strong spirit of unity and cooperation. During the trial production of a 120-ton hydraulic tractor, the workers from the drilling department, machinery factory, repair general station, and transportation department of various ethnic groups joined forces, closely cooperated, and supported each other. In a short period, they successfully developed China's first 120-ton hydraulic tractor. Using this tractor to move the wellhead frame avoids wear and tear on the wellhead base, saves transportation vehicles, increases the moving speed, and reduces the labor intensity of the workers.

    克拉玛依油田技术革新获显著成就
    我国重要石油基地克拉玛依油田的各族革命工人，发挥工人阶级的领导作用，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使革命的大批判深入发展，群众性的技术革新和技术革命活动取得了显著成就。今年前八个月，全矿钻井、采油、炼油都全面超额完成计划，试油等生产指标，已经提前三个多月完成全年生产计划。
    长期以来，克拉玛依油矿一小撮走资派，极力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办企业路线和修正主义科技路线，压制和阻挠石油工人的合理化建议和技术革新活动，严重影响了油田生产的发展。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，各族石油工人，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大造一小撮走资派的反，深刻地揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线。持续深入的革命大批判，极大地提高了广大石油工人的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了技术革命的蓬勃开展。从一九六七年到现在，全矿共实现技术革新三百五十多项，其中有许多是重大的技术革新项目。
    活学活用毛主席著作先进集体采油三厂三队六号站的采油工人和革命干部、革命技术人员一起，跑遍了克拉玛依有关部门，对五十多口油、水井的地质情况和出油情况进行调查研究，终于在二三九七井初步试验成功了一项新的油层开采工艺，经过革新，全站日产量增加一倍半。
    在蓬勃开展的技术革新、技术革命中，各族石油工人，团结协作蔚然成风。在一百二十吨液压拖车的试制过程中，钻井处、机械厂、修复总站、运输处各族工人拧成一股绳，密切配合，互相支持，在很短时间里试制成功了我国第一台一百二十吨液压拖车。用这种拖车搬运井架，避免了井架底座的磨损，节约了运输车辆，提高了搬运速度，减轻了工人的劳动强度。
