In the rural areas of Jianyang County, Sichuan, a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's revolutionary educational thought and to criticize and repudiate the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev is surging ahead. Poor and lower-middle peasants have seized control of rural education through struggle, and rural education is undergoing profound changes.

After the poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of the primary school in Mato Village, Maliping Commune, they immediately led the revolutionary teachers and students to demolish a mud wall that divided the schoolyard in half. They also held a special criticism meeting.

Why were the poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary teachers and students so eager to demolish this wall and so indignant about it? There is a story behind it.

Originally, Mato Village Primary School was a complete courtyard. Later, when this mud wall was built, it forcibly divided the courtyard into two parts. On either side of the wall was a primary school, both first-grade, and the students were mostly children of poor and lower-middle peasants from the same production brigade. However, because one was "state-run" and the other was "community-run," these two schools, separated by a wall, had stark differences in status. The state-run school had medical supplies, tea, and water fees; students could drink tea when thirsty, apply medicine when injured, and had sports and cultural fees; students had balls to play with and ropes to jump. The community-run school lacked these facilities, and students could only watch from the other side of the wall. Not to mention, graduates from the state-run school were sent to higher-level schools for further education, while students from the community-run school were considered to have no prospects for cultivation and were sent back to the brigade for labor. Therefore, teachers in the state-run school were considered superior to those in the community-run school. People respectfully called the state-run school teachers "senior teachers," while those teaching in the community-run school were called "junior teachers."

The artificial boundary represented by this wall caused serious opposition between the two schools. Students and teachers from the state-run school looked down on those from the community-run school, and vice versa. Both sides had many disputes across the wall. Outside the school, students from the two schools often fought and scolded each other. Some teachers from both schools were former classmates, but despite teaching in the same courtyard, they did not communicate for years and did not greet each other when they met. Even the parents of the students had many arguments.

The poor and lower-middle peasants were very dissatisfied with this situation. They had long asked, "Why are there two first-grade schools in one courtyard? Why should the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, who are all successors of New China, be divided into two classes?" However, in the past, the state-run school was managed by the district, and they had no right to intervene. Recently, with the development of the rural educational revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students studied Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, opened their eyes, and realized that this was the work of China's Khrushchev, the result of his push for the revisionist educational line. Under the unanimous demand of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students, the mud wall was demolished, and the two first-grade schools were merged into one, with teachers and classroom equipment unified. The first-grade school was expanded into a five-year complete primary school, and students from the two schools now sit together on the same bench to attend classes.

    拆墙记
    在四川简阳县农村，一个大学大用毛主席教育革命思想，大批大破中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的群众运动正在兴起，贫下中农在斗争中掌握了农村教育大权，农村教育发生了深刻的变化。
    七里公社马头村小学由贫下中农管理后，他们就立即领导革命师生把拦腰横在校院当中的一道土墙拆掉，而且还专门举行了一次批判大会。
    为什么贫下中农和革命师生这样急于拆掉这道墙？对它表现出如此气愤？这里面有一段来历。
    马头村小学本来是一座完整的大院子，后来，筑起这道土墙，便把它硬割成两个部分。墙的两边各有一所小学，同是初小，学生也大都是同一个大队里的贫下中农子女，只因为一个是“公办”的，一个是“民办”的，这两个一墙之隔的学校却存在着鲜明的等级差别。公办的有医药、茶水费，学生渴了有茶喝，碰破了手脚有药擦，还有文体费，学生有球玩，有绳子跳；民办的这些设施都没有，学生只能隔墙望着。这且不说，公办的学生毕业后是要往上级学校输送“深造”的，民办的学生被看作是没有培养前途的，一律回队里劳动。因此，公办小学的教师也要比民办小学的教师高一等，人们尊称为“大老师”，教民办的被称作“二老师”。
    由这道土墙体现出来的一条极不合理的人造界线，造成了两个学校的严重对立。公办的学生和老师看不起民办的，民办的看不惯公办的，双方隔着墙闹了不少纠纷。在校外，两校的学生也经常相互打骂。两方的教师有的原是过去的同学，尽管在一个院子里教书，却长年不相往来，见了面都不打招呼。甚至学生家长之间也发生了不少口角。
    贫下中农对这种情况非常不满，他们很早就提出质问说：“为啥同一个院子办两个初小？为啥都是贫下中农子女，都是新中国的接班人要分为两等？”可是过去公办小学归区里管理，他们无权过问。最近农村教育革命开展后，贫下中农和革命师生学习了毛主席教育革命的光辉思想，擦亮了眼睛，认识到这是中国赫鲁晓夫搞的鬼，是他推行修正主义教育路线的恶果。在贫下中农和革命师生一致要求下，土墙被拆掉了，两个初小合并成了一个，统一使用教师和教室设备，把初小扩大为五年制的完小，两个学校的学生现在亲热地坐在一条板凳上听课了。
