	According to a report by the East Asia News Agency, 2,000 dock workers in the port of Moji, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, went on strike starting at dawn on the 17th, opposing U.S. imperialism's use of Japanese bases to wage aggression against Vietnam.

	This strike halted the unloading work of the U.S. military cargo ship "Shagmu" completely. This ship carried 729 tons of military supplies for use in the Vietnam War into the port of Moji. These supplies were scheduled to be transported to the U.S. Air Force's Yamada ammunition depot. Due to the strike, not a single ton of these supplies has been unloaded to this day.

	In May of this year, the dock workers in Moji port had refused to unload U.S. military supplies in protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. Since then, until the arrival of the "Shagmu" in Moji port, the U.S. military had not unloaded any supplies in Moji.

	On the morning of the 17th, many workers from other industries in the Moji region gathered at the dock to hold a rally, supporting the dock workers' brave struggle.

	According to a report by the East Asia News Agency, approximately 1,500 progressive students in Japan held a rally at Tokyo University on the 16th, strongly protesting the savage suppression of students' just struggles by the reactionary Sato government.

	For several months, these students have been persistently fighting against the corrupt educational system and opposing the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' use of university research for military purposes.

	The meeting unanimously strongly condemned the Sato reactionary government for mobilizing armed police and right-wing thugs to savagely suppress the students.

	The meeting resolutely declared that the struggle would continue until the reactionary forces' rule is completely smashed.

	A student speaking at the meeting emphasized: "The current struggle against the reactionary educational system in various universities is closely linked with the struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people to smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.'"

	He said: "The Sato reactionary government is very afraid of the stormy development of the student movement, and they are trying their best to intensify the suppression of the student struggle.

	"But we are determined to further strengthen our struggle to counterattack them."

	Students from Tokyo University, Nihon University, Tokyo University of Education, Keio University, and Toyo University participated in the rally.

    反对美帝利用日本基地进行侵越战争
    日本门司港二千码头工人举行罢工
    一千五百名日本进步学生集会抗议反动政府对学生斗争的野蛮镇压
    新华社十七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本福冈县门司港二千名码头工人从十七日清晨起举行罢工，反对美帝国主义利用日本基地进行侵略越南的战争。
    这次罢工使美国军用货船“沙格木号”的卸货工作完全停顿。这艘货船装载了将用于侵越战争的七百二十九吨军火进入门司港。这批军火预定运往美国空军山田军火库。由于罢工，这批军火至今一吨也没有卸下。
    今年五月，门司港码头工人为抗议美帝国主义侵略越南，曾拒绝卸下美国军火。从那时起，到这次“沙格木号”开入门司港，美军一直没有在门司港卸下军火。
    门司地区其他工业的许多工人，十七日上午聚集在门司码头举行集会，支持码头工人的英勇斗争。
    新华社十七日讯　据东方通讯社报道：大约一千五百名日本进步学生，十六日在东京大学举行集会，强烈抗议佐藤反动政府对学生正义斗争的野蛮镇压。
    几个月来，这些学生一直坚持斗争，反对腐朽的教育制度，反对美日反动派把大学的研究工作用于军事目的。
    大会一致强烈谴责佐藤反动政府调动武装警察和右派恶棍对学生进行野蛮镇压。
    大会坚决表示，要把斗争坚持进行下去，直到完全粉碎反动势力的统治为止。
    一位学生在会上发言时强调说：“目前在各大学开展的反对反动教育制度的斗争，是同日本广大人民群众粉碎日美‘安全条约’的斗争紧密地联系在一起的。”
    他说：“佐藤反动政府十分害怕学生运动的急风暴雨般的发展，他们竭力企图加紧镇压学生斗争。
    “但是，我们决心进一步加强我们的斗争来回击他们。”
    参加集会的有东京大学、日本大学、东京教育大学、庆应大学和东洋大学的学生们。（附图片）
