The revolutionary committee of the No. 3523 Factory in Shenyang organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for cadres who were sent down to labor, helping them understand the great significance of being sent down to labor, correcting their attitudes towards labor, and further strengthening their resolve to follow the path of integrating with the workers and peasants.

The report states: The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "A large number of cadres being sent down to labor is a great opportunity for them to learn anew." After a large number of cadres were sent down to labor, should the revolutionary committee still manage them, and how? The revolutionary committee of the No. 3523 Factory in Shenyang deeply felt through practice that: It is necessary to have an attitude of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a deep proletarian sentiment, to enthusiastically help the sent-down cadres establish a thorough spirit of self-revolution, and to strongly promote the thought revolutionization of cadres.

In March of this year, after Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel" were issued, the factory revolutionary committee immediately mobilized the masses to streamline the organization, successively sending down 85% of the cadres to the production front line to participate in labor. At this time, some members of the revolutionary committee thought that the streamlined cadres had gone down, and the task was completed. However, the facts were the opposite: although most cadres worked hard and labored, some cadres, although they went down, their thoughts did not go down, and they harbored grievances. Some cadres said: "Being a worker is carefree, being a cadre is troublesome, let's just labor!" Facing the above situation, the propaganda team and the revolutionary committee together studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Cadres, through participating in collective productive labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucracy, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." They realized that: after a large number of cadres were sent down to labor, whether the revolutionary committee manages them or not, whether they manage them generally or responsibly, this is not only a matter of class sentiment towards the broad masses of cadres, but also a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and it is a major issue related to whether we can cultivate and train tens of millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and whether we can prevent revisionism.

After raising their awareness, the revolutionary committee held several study classes on Mao Zedong Thought for the sent-down cadres. In the study classes, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive" and held a big discussion on "Why should cadres be sent down to labor." Everyone realized that: to fundamentally prevent revisionism, one must consciously follow the revolutionary path of being able to go up and down, being able to be an official and a commoner, being able to do both literary and military work, as indicated by Chairman Mao.

To help everyone correct their attitude towards labor, the revolutionary committee also used typical figures to enlighten and educate everyone. The original political instructor Zhang Manchang, who was sent down to labor, thought: After working hard as a cadre for more than ten years, the result is like this, and he felt wronged and couldn't do the work well. Later, the veteran workers helped him study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Now some people go to factories and rural areas, and the result is that some have gains and some have none. This is a matter of stance or attitude, that is, a matter of worldview." This made him dispel his grievances and raise his awareness. From then on, he eagerly carried heavy iron materials weighing hundreds of pounds, did the dirtiest work, and actively exposed his shortcomings to the workers, learned humbly from the workers, and actively cared about the work of the team, receiving the welcome of the workers and being elected as the team and group leader. He deeply felt: "Laboring with a grudge will inevitably make you physically in labor but mentally outside the masses, and you can't even be an ordinary worker!" His process of changing his thoughts educated the sent-down cadres deeply. Everyone enthusiastically pledged allegiance to Chairman Mao, determined to undergo the most arduous tempering in labor.

One day, a sent-down cadre returned to the original office for something and saw that his name had been crossed off the duty roster, so he went to the revolutionary committee to complain: "I have been sent down for several months, am I still a cadre or not?!" This incident made the revolutionary committee realize that they must help the sent-down cadres strengthen their resolve to labor long-term and thoroughly transform their worldview. Therefore, the revolutionary committee members went deep into the teams to investigate the ideological trends of the sent-down cadres and found that many cadres had a temporary mindset towards being sent down to labor. They analyzed the root causes of this mindset, which was mainly the lingering poison of the revisionist labor gilding theory of the Chinese Khrushchev in the minds of the cadres, which had not been thoroughly cleaned up. To establish a thorough mindset of laboring long-term and transforming one's worldview, it is necessary to constantly and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle.

Under the organization of the revolutionary committee, the sent-down cadres and the broad masses of workers together launched a revolutionary criticism and struggle against the labor gilding theory of the Chinese Khrushchev. Everyone said: "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation.' The Chinese Khrushchev, however, advocates 'sweeping the floor and shoveling dirt will change the people's impression.' If we follow his labor gilding theory, it will only make the heart blacker and the person more revisionist." Many cadres of intellectual origin, after laboring for a few months, thought that their thoughts had been transformed enough and wanted to return to the office. After participating in the revolutionary criticism and struggle, they were deeply educated and determined to be ordinary laborers for life, to always integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to always be students of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    干部下放后怎样做好他们的思想工作？
    沈阳三五二三厂革委会，组织下放劳动的干部举办毛泽东思想学习班，使他们认识到下放劳动的伟大意义，端正了劳动态度，更加坚定了同工农相结合道路的决心
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会”。大批干部下放劳动后，革委会还要不要管，怎样管？沈阳三五二三厂革委会，从实践中深深体会到：必须以无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的态度，和深厚的无产阶级感情，满腔热情地帮助下放干部树立彻底的自我革命精神，有力地促进干部的思想革命化。
    今年三月份，毛主席关于“精兵简政”的最新指示发表后，厂革委会立即发动群众精简了机构，先后将百分之八十五的干部下放到生产第一线参加劳动。这时，革委会少数成员以为，精简的干部下去了，任务就完成了。可是，事实恰恰相反：尽管大多数干部安心劳动锻炼，但有些干部人下去了，思想并没有下去，存在着一股怨气。有的干部说：“当工人省心，当干部操心，劳动就劳动吧！”针对上述情况，宣传队和革委会一起学习了毛主席“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义”的教导，认识到：大批干部下放劳动后，革委会对他们是管还是不管，是一般地管还是认真负责地管，这不仅是对待广大干部的阶级感情问题，而且是对毛主席革命路线的根本态度问题，是关系到能否培养造就千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人，能否反修防修的大问题。
    认识提高后，革委会就多次举办了下放干部毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，他们反复学习了毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，展开了“干部为什么要下放劳动”的大讨论。大家认识到：要从根本上反修防修，就要自觉地走毛主席指引的能上能下、能“官”能民、能文能武的革命道路。
    为了帮助大家端正对待劳动的态度，革委会还用典型人物启发教育大家。下放劳动的原政治指导员张满昌同志以为：辛辛苦苦当了十几年干部，最后闹了这么个结果，心里憋气，活也干不好。后来，老师傅们帮助他学习了毛主席“现在也有一些人到工厂农村去，结果是有的有收获，有的就没有收获。这中间有一个立场问题或者态度问题，也就是世界观的问题”的教导，使他打掉了怨气，提高了认识。从此，他上百斤重的铁料抢着挑，什么活最脏就干什么活，并且在工人中主动亮私斗私，虚心向工人学习，积极关心班组的工作，受到了工人们的欢迎，被大家选为班、组负责人。他深有感触地说：“带着一股子怨气劳动，就必然是身在劳动中，心在群众外，连个普通工人也当不好！”他的思想转变过程，使下放干部们深受教育。大家纷纷向毛主席献忠心，决心在劳动中经受最艰苦的锻炼。
    一天，有个下放干部因事回原办公室，看到值班表上勾掉了自己的名字，就找革委会提意见说：“我下放几个月了，到底还算不算干部？！”这件事使革委会意识到，必须帮助下放干部增强长期劳动、彻底改造世界观的决心。于是革委会同志深入班组，调查了下放干部的思想动向，发现不少干部对下放劳动存有临时观念。他们分析了产生这种思想的根源，主要是中国赫鲁晓夫劳动镀金论的修正主义流毒，在干部头脑中还没有肃清。不破不立，要使干部扎下安心劳动、长期改造的思想根子，就必须经常深入地开展革命大批判。
    在革委会的组织下，下放干部和广大工人一起，对中国赫鲁晓夫的劳动镀金论展开了一场革命的大批判。大家说：“毛主席教导我们，‘世界观的转变是一个根本的转变’。中国赫鲁晓夫却鼓吹什么‘扫扫地，铲铲土，就会改变群众的观感’。照他的劳动镀金论去干，只能是越镀心越黑，越镀人越修。”不少知识分子出身的干部，在劳动几个月后，曾认为思想改造得差不多了，想回去坐办公室。参加了革命大批判后，他们深受教育，决心一辈子做普通劳动者，永远和工农兵相结合，永远做工农兵的小学生。　沈勤支
