	"Oppose unloading U.S. military ammunition! Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!"
	Japanese dockworkers in Mojiko Port persist in their anti-U.S. patriotic struggle
	Students from Kitakyushu University and dockworkers in Mojiko Port respond in unison, launching anti-U.S. struggles and engaging in fierce battles with reactionary military police

	New China News Agency, October 24th: According to the Oriental News Agency, the strike by dockworkers in Mojiko Port, Japan, which began on the 17th to oppose the unloading of ammunition from the U.S. military ship "Shagumaru," has lasted for seven days. This just anti-U.S. patriotic struggle has received widespread support from the Japanese people. On the 22nd, more than 500 dockworkers and supporters from various parts of Mojiko Port held an anti-U.S. rally at the Kasishima Pier. In the afternoon, two large cranes directed by U.S. military officers charged towards the workers' picket line, attempting to forcibly unload the ammunition. However, the workers sat firmly in place, bravely blocking the cranes. The reactionary Sato government, acting as a lackey of U.S. imperialism, dispatched over 600 armed police to beat and kick the workers, brutally suppressing them in an attempt to break through the workers' picket line. The dockworkers put up a tenacious struggle against the reactionary police. They shouted, "Oppose unloading U.S. military ammunition! Demolish the U.S. air force ammunition depot in Yamada! Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!"

	On the 23rd, a thousand workers and students from various parts of Fukuoka Prefecture gathered at the Tajima Pier in Mojiko Port to support the dockworkers' strike and oppose the unloading of U.S. military ammunition. The head of the Shimoniwa-Mojiko branch of the All-Japan Port Workers' Union, Ikuma Ikeda, said at the meeting: The anti-U.S. patriotic struggle that has erupted in Mojiko Port will continue to burn like wildfire. Let us persist in the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demolish all U.S. military bases.

	Students from Kitakyushu University responded to the dockworkers' strike in Mojiko Port, launching an anti-U.S. struggle in front of the U.S. air force ammunition depot in Yamada, Kojima District, on the 23rd, and engaging in fierce battles with the reactionary police who came to suppress them.

    北九州大学爱国学生和门司港工人相呼应，展开反美斗争并同反动军警激烈搏斗
    新华社二十四日讯  据东方通讯社报道：日本门司港码头工人从十七日起举行的反对从美国军火船“沙格木号”卸下弹药的罢工，已经持续了七天。这场反美爱国正义斗争得到了日本人民的广泛支持。二十二日，门司港的码头工人和前来支援罢工的群众五百多人，在笠石码头举行反美集会。下午，由美国军官指挥的两辆大型起重车向码头工人的罢工纠察线冲来，阴谋强行卸运弹药。但是，工人们坚定地坐着不动，勇敢地挡住了起重车。美帝走狗佐藤政府派出六百多名武装警察对工人拳打脚踢，进行残酷镇压，企图使美军车辆能够冲破工人的罢工纠察线。码头工人同反动警察展开了顽强的斗争。他们高呼：“反对卸下美军弹药！”“拆除山田美国空军弹药库！”“粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”
    二十三日，来自福冈县各地的一千名工人和学生，在门司港田浦码头举行集会，支援码头工人的罢工，反对卸下美军弹药。全日本港湾工会下关门司支部负责人池田寅夫在会上讲话说：在门司港掀起的这场反美爱国斗争，定将象野火一样继续燃烧下去。让我们坚持斗争，把粉碎日美“安全条约”和拆除一切美军基地的斗争进行到底。
    北九州大学的爱国学生同门司港码头工人的罢工相呼应，二十三日在小仓区山田美国空军弹药库前面展开反美斗争，并同前来镇压他们的反动警察进行激烈的搏斗。
