	We Workers Have Taken Control of the Factory
	Assembly Workshop Riveting Group	Wang Weize

	In the past, our factory was under the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Many of our products were poorly designed and of low quality. A nine-cubic-meter air compressor, for example, broke down after only fifty hours of use. The miners who used it were furious and dragged the machine back to our factory for repairs. We workers were also furious. We gathered around the broken machine and shouted, “Bring out the capitalist roaders and the bourgeois technical ‘authorities’!”

	The criticism meeting began. We directly denounced the Chinese Khrushchev’s fallacies of praising bourgeois experts and slandering the working class. We exposed the harm caused by the Chinese Khrushchev’s revisionist line in our factory. We angrily ordered a few capitalist roaders and reactionary technical “authorities” to “lie down under the machine and see how you did it! Only fifty hours of use and the shaft broke, wasting so much state resources!” Those few people clumsily lay down under the machine and looked at it, having nothing to say about their unreasonable technical design.

	The workers, seeing their ugly faces, fiercely criticized, “Is this the first time you’ve lain down under a machine? In the past, you all sat in high-rise buildings, acting like officials and gentlemen. You rarely entered the workshop, and even then, you had to hold up your pants, afraid that the oil and dirt would stain your clothes. You are walking the capitalist road. Relying on you to run the factory according to the Chinese Khrushchev’s line, the factory can only get worse and worse. This broken shaft is the evidence!”

	“Running the factory depends on the workers!” Everyone pointed to the two clutches in front of them and said, “The clutch is an important part of the air compressor. Look, what did the bourgeois technical ‘authorities’ design? The parts are many and not practical. Now, look at what we workers have designed! It’s so simple and practical.” Before finishing the sentence, everyone shouted, “Let those few people count for themselves. How many parts are in your design? How many parts are in ours? Which is better?” Those few people had to look at it and stammered, “Our design has over ninety parts, while the workers’ design has only sixteen parts, with a simple structure and practical use.”

	Faced with the ironclad facts, a few capitalist roaders and reactionary technical “authorities” hung their heads in defeat, while we worker comrades were proud and confident. Everyone boldly criticized, “The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents only believe in ‘experts’ and ‘authorities,’ stepping on the workers. Now let them see the might of the working class. Chairman Mao said the working class should lead everything. The power in the factory is now in the hands of the working class.”

	The criticism meeting was short and powerful, ending amidst the chorus of “Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!”

    工厂大权咱工人掌定了
    装配车间铆工组　王卫泽
    过去我厂在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线控制下，许多产品设计不合理，质量不合格。一架九立方米的空气压缩机出厂后，只使用了五十小时，轴就断了。使用单位的矿工兄弟气得什么似的，老远地把机器拉回我厂来修理。我们工人看了也气得什么似的，大伙聚集到那个断了轴的大家伙旁边，一声号令：“把走资派、资产阶级技术‘权威’带上来！”批判会就开始了。
    我们直截了当地声讨了中国赫鲁晓夫吹捧资产阶级专家、诬蔑工人阶级的谬论，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线在我厂的毒害。大家愤怒地喝令一小撮走资派和反动技术“权威”：“躺到机器底下去，看看你们是怎么搞的，只使用五十小时就断轴，浪费多少国家资财！”那几个家伙笨手笨脚躺到机器底下去看了一遍，对于自己不合理的技术设计无话可说。
    工人看了他们那副丑相，狠狠批判道：“你们这还是第一次躺到机器底下去吧？过去你们都坐在高楼大厦里做官当老爷，难得进次把车间，还要两手提着裤子，生怕油泥沾脏了衣裳。你们走的就是资本主义道路。靠你们按着中国赫鲁晓夫的路线办厂，只能越办越糟，眼前这个断了轴的废物就是罪证！”
    “办厂就得靠工人！”大伙指着面前摆着的两个离合器说：“离合器是空气压缩机的重要部件。看，过去资产阶级技术‘权威’设计的是什么东西？零件又多，又不好使。现在咱们工人自己设计出来的多棒！又简单，又好用。”一语未了，大伙吼开了：“叫那几个家伙自己去数，你们设计的有多少零件？我们设计的有多少零件？到底哪个好？”几个家伙只得看了一遍，嚅嚅地说：“我们设计的离合器有九十多个零件，工人设计的才十六个零件，构造简单，实用。”
    在铁的事实面前，一小撮走资派、反动技术“权威”垂头丧气，咱工人哥儿们可扬眉吐气了。大伙理直气壮地批判说：“中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人，只相信‘专家’、‘权威’，把工人踩在脚底下。现在让他们看看我们工人阶级的颜色。毛主席叫工人阶级领导一切，工厂的大权我们工人阶级掌定了。”
    批判会简短有力，在一片“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的口号声中结束。
