Japanese Workers and Students in Hokkaido Attack "Self-Defense Forces"

	According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 28th, workers and students in various parts of Japan staged protests on the 27th against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' revival of Japanese militarism and against the parade of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces."

	In Hokkaido, Yamagata, and Tokyo, workers and students threw stones at the tanks of the "Self-Defense Forces" participating in the parade, blocking their advance. The brave struggle of the workers and students struck fear into the hearts of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

	In the city of Muroran, Hokkaido, about 200 patriotic students from Muroran Industrial University approached the "Self-Defense Forces" tank convoy driving through the city's main streets. They strongly protested the revival of Japanese militarism and the reactionary Sato government's collusion with U.S. imperialism to wage wars of aggression. This forced the tanks to stop temporarily. Workers and citizens expressed their support for the students' just struggle.

	In the city of Tomakomai, Hokkaido, several hundred workers and citizens held a rally, demanding the dissolution of the "Self-Defense Forces" and vowing to continue the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

	In the city of Yamagata, about 50 young workers and students threw stones at the "Self-Defense Forces" as they passed through the city center. The young workers and students engaged in a fierce struggle with the reactionary police who were acting as bodyguards for the "Self-Defense Forces" parade.

	Over a Thousand New Zealanders Hold Anti-U.S. Demonstration

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in Wellington on the 28th, over a thousand people in Auckland, New Zealand, held a demonstration on the 28th to protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. The demonstrators carried large banners with slogans such as:

	"Yankees, get out of Vietnam!" "U.S. fascists and New Zealand lackeys, get out of Vietnam!"

	The demonstrators held a passionate rally in Auckland's largest park and then marched through the city, repeatedly shouting, "Yankees, go home!" "Vietnam will win!"

	Anti-U.S. Demonstrations Erupt in Several Canadian Cities

	According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 29th, in recent days, people in Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Halifax in Canada have held mass demonstrations to protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

	In Vancouver and Winnipeg, demonstrators burned the U.S. flag in front of the U.S. consulates.

	In Toronto, about 700 demonstrators clashed with police who came to suppress them, and several dozen demonstrators were unlawfully arrested.

	Australian Youth Hold Rainy Protest Against U.S. Aggression in Vietnam

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in Melbourne on the 26th, over 200 Australian youth held a demonstration on the evening of the 25th to protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. The demonstrators bravely fought with the reactionary police who came to suppress them.

	The demonstrators, braving heavy rain, started their march from the Melbourne office of the U.S. Dow Chemical Company, which manufactures napalm used in the Vietnam War, and proceeded into the city center.

	Despite the reactionary authorities deploying a large number of police to suppress the demonstration, the demonstrators tenaciously continued their struggle for nearly an hour.
