The Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee in Jiangxi Province is following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "cherish cadres" by enthusiastically assisting cadres sent down to the countryside to raise their political consciousness. These cadres, who have been sent down to participate in labor, are vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought, persistently engaging in collective production labor, and learning anew through labor, class struggle, and rural work.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Nanchang on the 17th states: The Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee, guided by Chairman Mao's great directive to "streamline administration and reduce personnel," has resolutely taken the path of streamlining administration and reducing personnel. It has sent down over 710 cadres to rural areas to settle and participate in collective production labor. These cadres, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have actively thrown themselves into the fiery three great revolutionary movements in the countryside and voluntarily accepted re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants to transform their worldviews. The county revolutionary committee believes that the revolutionary enthusiasm of these cadres is not only a highly favorable factor for their self-transformation but also a powerful driving force for accelerating socialist construction in the countryside. All levels of revolutionary committees should cherish and support this enthusiasm. Therefore, after a large number of cadres were sent down to participate in labor, the county revolutionary committee paid great attention to encouraging and unleashing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the sent-down cadres, praising and setting examples among them to inspire the entire group. Cadres like Yuan Wanxiang, who went to Fengyang Commune's Ercha Dazhai to work as a peasant, immediately took his family to the fields after settling down. He changed from his cadre uniform to peasant clothes, wore straw sandals he made himself, and led the poor and lower-middle peasants to brave the winds of class struggle. In a short time, he repaired a reservoir that had been neglected for over two years. During the reservoir repair, Yuan Wanxiang voluntarily exposed his personal issues to the poor and lower-middle peasants, self-critically examining how his feet and hands had become soft and his feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants had faded after becoming an "official." The poor and lower-middle peasants saw that he had calluses on his feet and blisters on his hands, and his feelings for them had deepened. They praised him as a "cadre who has returned to his roots." The county revolutionary committee seized on his exemplary deeds and widely publicized them among the sent-down cadres, greatly inspiring and encouraging the entire group of sent-down cadres. Now, throughout the county, there are many exemplary sent-down cadres, pushing the sent-down cadres to advance rapidly on the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

The Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee regards strengthening political and ideological leadership over the sent-down cadres as an important task. They believe that the large number of cadres moving from offices to the countryside is just the beginning of their re-education. On their journey forward, they may encounter various twists and turns, and some may even have recurring thoughts. This requires persistent and detailed ideological and political work. Therefore, the revolutionary committee often pays attention to criticizing the tendency to neglect ideological and political work among the sent-down cadres. After a large number of cadres were sent down, some members of the revolutionary committee had a sense of relief, thinking that the re-education task of the sent-down cadres had been handed over to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and that the leadership could "lay down their burdens." The revolutionary committee promptly organized a study of Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, linking them to the new situations that arose after the cadres were sent down, and conducted a "three compare, three look" exercise: comparing the eagerness of the cadres to progress after being sent down, looking at the responsibilities of the leaders in this new situation; comparing the various active thoughts that arise on the cadres' forward path, looking at the importance of strengthening ideological and political work; comparing the new situations after the cadres were sent down, looking at the arduousness of conducting ideological and political work. Through the "three compare, three look," everyone unanimously recognized that after the cadres were sent down, the ideological and political work for them was not reduced but increased. After raising their awareness, all levels of leadership consciously strengthened their political and ideological leadership over the sent-down cadres, promptly solving various ideological problems that arose among them.

For a period, there was a widespread phenomenon among the sent-down cadres of burying their heads in labor without involving themselves in the revolutionary work of the production teams; some even had the idea of "learning skills and strengthening their bodies" while laboring. In response to this active thought, the county revolutionary committee promptly organized the sent-down cadres to study Chairman Mao's instructions on cadres participating in labor, helping them deeply understand the profound significance of cadres participating in labor and correcting their labor attitudes. At the same time, they clearly defined the tasks of the sent-down cadres in two aspects: one is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres, turn the countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. The other is to persist in participating in collective production labor, learning anew through labor, class struggle, and rural work, and absolutely not to detach themselves from the three great revolutionary movements and simply bury their heads in labor. Due to the timely resolution of active thoughts and the clarification of tasks, the sent-down cadres actively participated in the three great revolutionary struggles, and their political consciousness rapidly improved, winning the welcome of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Members of various levels of revolutionary committees often go deep into the sent-down cadres to understand their active thoughts, solve new problems, and greatly encourage the sent-down cadres. Recently, members of the county revolutionary committee have gone to communes and production teams to conduct a general visit to all sent-down cadres in the county. County and commune revolutionary committees and brigade leadership teams have also universally held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for the sent-down cadres, ensuring that each sent-down cadre participated in two to three study sessions. The sent-down cadres studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the transformation of intellectuals in the study classes, further firming up their confidence and determination to walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

The Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee has realized in practice that the poor and lower-middle peasants love, care for, and are best at educating cadres. Having the poor and lower-middle peasants strengthen the re-education of cadres is the most effective way to accelerate the growth of the sent-down cadres. Therefore, the county revolutionary committee organized representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants and non-full-time members of various levels of revolutionary committees to study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, making them aware of their responsibilities; and stipulated that non-full-time members of various levels of revolutionary committees should be responsible for leading the sent-down cadres in their respective units; at the same time, they should often go deep into the sent-down cadres to help them solve problems related to labor, work, and study. In this way, throughout the county, a new situation has been formed where the poor and lower-middle peasants universally do the work of the sent-down cadres, achieving remarkable results.

There was a cadre who made serious mistakes during the Cultural Revolution and lacked self-awareness of his mistakes. This time, he was sent down to Gaopo Brigade in Fengyang Commune. In just a few days, more than ten poor and lower-middle peasants had heart-to-heart talks with him, did ideological work with him, and recalled the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society with him, deeply educating him. Later, he regained his revolutionary spirit, stood tall, actively checked his mistakes with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and actively threw himself into the revolutionary torrent. He deeply felt that the poor and lower-middle peasants were his best teachers for re-learning, and he must honestly accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants not only care for the sent-down cadres politically but also in every aspect. A "three-door" cadre sent down to Chaochang Commune, who could not lift or carry, was paired with an old poor peasant who took him to the fields, taught him farming, and often encouraged him to remember Chairman Mao's instructions to never detach himself from labor and to integrate with the poor and lower-middle peasants for life.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, starting from cherishing cadres, actively help and supervise the sent-down cadres in every way, accelerating their progress. A leading cadre in the county, due to long-term detachment from the masses and excessive officialdom, still could not put down his airs after being sent down to the countryside. The production team let him participate in the criticism meeting of the poor and lower-middle peasants against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of building political power, and frankly pointed out his shortcomings of not putting down his airs. Under the help and supervision of the masses, this cadre quickly changed his style and, as an ordinary commune member, came and went among the masses, winning their love.

While strengthening political and ideological leadership, the Fenyi County Revolutionary Committee also carefully helps solve practical problems encountered by the sent-down cadres in their work, striving to create good conditions for their re-learning.

To enable cadres sent down to remote mountain areas to timely hear Chairman Mao's latest instructions and understand domestic and international situations, many places have established "contact networks" for the sent-down cadres, with people at the county, commune, brigade, and production team levels responsible for the work of the sent-down cadres. The county and commune often invite sent-down cadres to participate in relevant meetings, distribute study materials to them, and help them establish the system of "scattered labor, concentrated study."

For some cadres who have settled in rural areas, in addition to helping them solve some difficulties in living arrangements, various places have also made proper arrangements for their family members to participate in collective production labor and for the education of their children.

    分宜县革委会遵照毛主席必须善于爱护干部的伟大教导
    热情帮助下放劳动干部提高政治觉悟
    下放参加劳动的干部，大力宣传毛泽东思想，坚持参加集体生产劳动，在劳动中、在阶级斗争中、在农村工作中重新学习
    新华社南昌十七日电　江西省分宜县革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席“必须善于爱护干部”的教导，热情关心下放参加劳动的干部，帮助他们提高政治觉悟，在下放劳动过程中重新学习，彻底改变旧思想。
    支持下放干部的革命积极性，增强下放干部改造世界观的自觉性
    在毛主席“精兵简政”伟大教导的指引下，分宜县县级机关和各公社坚决走精兵简政的道路，先后下放了七百一十多名干部到农村安家落户，参加集体生产劳动。这些干部经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，在毛主席一系列最新指示的鼓舞下，积极投入农村火热的三大革命运动，并主动接受贫下中农的再教育，改造自己的世界观。县革委会认为，广大下放干部这种革命积极性，不仅是他们进行自我改造的极为有利的因素，也是加速农村社会主义建设的强大动力。各级革委会对此应当热情爱护，坚决支持。因此，在大批干部下放参加劳动后，县革委会十分注意鼓励和发挥下放干部的革命积极性，在他们中表扬先进，树立榜样，带动全体。下放干部袁万祥到风阳公社两茶大队当农民，行李一放，就带着全家下田劳动。他脱下干部服，换上农民装，穿上自己编织的草鞋，还领着贫下中农迎着阶级斗争的风浪，在很短的时间里，把一个拖了两年多没修好的水库修好了。在修水库的日子里，袁万祥主动向贫下中农亮私斗私，自觉检查自己当“官”后脚板薄了，手掌薄了，同贫下中农的感情也淡薄了的演变过程。贫下中农见他脚上又磨起了老茧，手上磨起了血泡，同贫下中农感情越来越深，都称他是“回了本色的好干部”。县革委会就抓住他的典型事迹，在下放干部中广为传播，大大鼓舞和激励了全体下放干部。现在，全县到处都有下放干部的好样板，推动下放干部在与工农相结合的道路上大步前进。
    加强对下放干部的政治思想领导，进一步坚定他们同工农相结合的决心
    分宜县革委会把加强对下放干部的政治思想领导作为一项重要任务。他们认为，大批干部从机关走到农村，这仅仅是干部重新学习的开始。在他们前进的路上，还可能遇到这样那样的曲折，少数同志的思想上甚至还会有反复，这就需要对干部做艰苦细致的思想政治工作。因此，革委会经常注意批判那种忽视对下放干部进行思想政治工作的倾向。在大批干部下放后，革委会中少数同志曾产生一种“松口气”的思想，认为下放干部的再教育任务已交给了贫下中农，领导可以“撂担子”了。革委会及时组织大家学习毛主席的有关教导，联系干部下放后出现的新情况，进行了“三摆三看”：摆广大干部下放后迫切要求进步的积极性，看领导者在这种新形势下的责任；摆下放干部在前进道路上不断出现的活思想，看加强思想政治工作的重要性；摆干部下放后的新情况，看进行思想政治工作的艰巨性。通过“三摆三看”，大家一致认识到：干部下放后，对他们的思想政治工作不是减轻了而是加重了。认识提高后，各级领导都自觉地加强对下放干部的政治思想领导工作，使下放干部中出现的一些思想问题及时得到了解决。
    有个时期，在下放干部中较普遍地出现一种埋头劳动，不过问生产队革命和工作的现象；有的甚至抱着一种“学技术，练体力”的思想去劳动。针对这种活思想，县革委会就及时组织下放干部们学习毛主席关于干部下放劳动的指示，使大家深刻领会干部参加劳动的深远意义，端正劳动态度。同时，明确规定下放干部的任务有两条：一条是宣传毛泽东思想，和广大贫下中农、基层干部一道，把农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。另一条是坚持参加集体生产劳动，在劳动中重新学习，在阶级斗争中重新学习，在农村工作中重新学习，绝不能脱离三大革命运动而单纯埋头劳动。由于及时地解决了活思想，明确了任务，下放干部积极投入了三大革命斗争，政治觉悟提高很快，受到贫下中农欢迎。
    各级革委会成员还经常深入到下放干部中去，了解他们的活思想，解决新问题，对下放干部鼓舞很大。最近以来，县革委会委员分别下到社、队，对全县下放干部进行了一次普遍的访问。县、社革委会和大队领导班子，还普遍为下放干部举办毛泽东思想学习班，使每个下放干部都参加了二至三次学习。下放干部们在学习班上学习了毛主席有关知识分子改造问题的教导，进一步坚定了走与工农相结合的道路的信心和决心。
    充分发挥贫下中农的作用，做好下放干部的再教育工作
    分宜县革委会在实践中体会到：贫下中农最爱护干部，最关心干部，最善于教育干部，由贫下中农加强对干部进行再教育，是加速下放干部成长的最有效办法。为此，县革委会组织贫下中农代表和各级革委会中的不脱产委员学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，使他们明确自己肩负的责任；并规定各级革委会的不脱产委员要对所属单位的下放干部负领导责任；同时要求他们经常深入到下放干部中去，帮助他们解决劳动、工作、学习各方面的问题。这样，在全县形成了一个贫下中农人人做下放干部工作的新局面，收到了显著成效。
    有一个干部在文化大革命中犯了严重错误，又对自己的错误一直缺乏认识。这次下放到风阳公社高坡大队，在短短的几天时间里，前后就有十多个贫下中农和他谈心，给他做思想工作，同他一起诉旧社会的苦，忆新社会的甜，使这个干部受到深刻的教育。以后，他振起革命精神，挺起腰杆，主动向贫下中农检查错误，积极投入了革命洪流。他深有体会地说：贫下中农是我重新学习的最好老师，我一定要老老实实接受贫下中农的再教育。
    广大贫下中农不仅从政治上，而且从各方面无微不至地关怀下放干部。下放在抄场公社的一个由家门到校门到机关门的“三门”干部，手不能提，肩不能挑，一位老贫农就和他结成“一对红”，带着他下田，把着手教他农活，并经常勉励他牢记毛主席的教导，永远不脱离劳动，和贫下中农结合一辈子。
    广大贫下中农从爱护干部出发，处处给下放干部以积极帮助和监督，加速了干部前进的步伐。县里有个领导干部，由于长期脱离群众，“官”气十足，下放到农村后，还放不下架子，生产队就让他参加贫下中农对反革命修正主义政权建设路线的批判会，并直率地指出他放不下架子的缺点。在群众的帮助和监督下，这个干部很快改变了作风，以一个普通社员的身份出入在群众之中，受到群众的爱戴。
    经常听取下放干部的意见，帮助他们解决一些实际问题
    分宜县革委会在切实加强政治思想领导的同时，对下放干部在实际工作中遇到的问题，也用心帮助解决，努力为他们创造重新学习的好条件。
    为了使下放在边远山区的干部能够及时听到毛主席的最新指示，了解国内外形势，许多地方都建立了下放干部“联系网”，县革委会、公社、大队、生产队都有人负责下放干部的工作。县、社经常吸收下放干部参加有关会议，发给他们学习文件，帮助他们建立了“分散劳动，集中学习”的制度。
    一些到农村安家落户的干部，各地除帮助他们解决生活安排上的一些困难外，对他们家属参加集体生产劳动和子女教育等问题，也都作了妥善安排。
