A large modern coal mine in Xinjiang, designed and constructed entirely by China, with an annual production capacity of tens of millions of tons, has officially begun production.

The construction of the No. 1 Shaft in Xinjiang involved a fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. Liu Shaoqi and his agents first pursued a policy of seeking size and foreign technology, and later found excuses to obstruct the construction of the mine. The broad masses of workers from various ethnic groups, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with the determination to "resolve to struggle, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," displayed boundless revolutionary enthusiasm. They smashed the enemy's sabotage plots and ensured the smooth progress of the mine construction. Especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers from various ethnic groups, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought actively, severely criticized the reactionary revisionist goods such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "material incentives," and "technology first" promoted by Liu Shaoqi, and achieved great victories in mine construction by promoting production through revolution.

    新疆一座大型现代化煤井投入生产
    新华社乌鲁木齐十九日电　新疆维吾尔自治区一座由我国自己设计、自己施工，年产数十万吨的大型现代化煤井——新疆一号立井，已正式投入生产。
    一号立井的建井过程，经历了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在矿井建设中先是求大、求洋，后来又找借口大肆阻挠矿井建设。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的各民族广大职工，怀着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的雄心壮志，发挥冲天的革命干劲，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，保证了矿井建设的顺利进行。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中，各族革命职工在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在人民解放军的大力帮助下，开办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的
  “阶级斗争熄灭论”、“物质刺激”、“技术第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，以革命带动生产，取得了矿井建设的巨大胜利。
