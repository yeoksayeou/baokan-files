On the 19th anniversary of National Day, I once again saw our great leader Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate. Chairman Mao looked radiant and full of vigor, walking briskly and smiling as he waved to us. Chairman Mao is in extremely good health, which is the greatest happiness for us poor and lower-middle peasants. Seeing Chairman Mao's great image, I was so moved that tears streamed down my face, and I didn't know what to say. All my words boiled down to one sentence: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao! I wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Chairman Mao cares the most about us poor and lower-middle peasants. He is always with us in spirit.

When Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, along with Premier Zhou, walked up to us representatives, Chairman Mao warmly shook my hand. With immense excitement, I said to him, "We poor and lower-middle peasants wish you eternal life! Eternal life!" Then Vice Chairman Lin and Premier Zhou also shook my hand one by one. When Vice Chairman Lin affectionately called me Gu Atiao, I said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants wish you good health! Everlasting health! You said, 'The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.' We will definitely follow your instructions, study Chairman Mao's books for life, and listen to Chairman Mao's words for life." The central leaders care so much about us, which I feel is the greatest concern and encouragement from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and under the unified command of the proletarian headquarters, we will advance victoriously!

This is the second time I have seen our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate. The first time was during the National Day celebrations in 1966, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution had just begun. Chairman Mao said, "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Over the past two years, we have followed Chairman Mao's great teachings and his great strategic deployments, overthrowing the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in various places. Except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, achieving a red land throughout the country, and putting the fate of the state firmly in the hands of the working class. Today, I have seen our great leader Chairman Mao again, how can I not be happy! The Party's kindness is greater than the sky and earth, and Chairman Mao's kindness is deeper than the sea and rivers.

Our Hongjin Production Brigade has been established under the personal care of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with the direct help of the PLA comrades, as an advanced unit in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao cares even more about us, while a handful of class enemies hate us even more. They see our victories as thorns in their eyes and bones in their throats. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party first followed the tune of China's Khrushchev, slandering us poor and lower-middle peasants for studying Mao Zedong Thought as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "formalism," saying that I am "just an old woman and cannot be a model." During the Cultural Revolution, I took the stage of revolutionary criticism and engaged in a face-to-face struggle with these capitalist roaders within the Party, using our poor and lower-middle peasants' advanced deeds in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to refute them until they were speechless and had to admit, "I am guilty, I am guilty!" The more the enemy opposes us, the more it ignites our deep class feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle, we study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, moving from victory to victory. We deeply feel that: a thousand victories, ten thousand victories, are all the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how the heavens change or the earth changes, our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change; no matter how the earth shakes or the mountains tremble, our resolve to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will never waver.

Vice Chairman Lin's important speech on National Day conveyed Chairman Mao's voice and the new battle orders from the proletarian headquarters, instructing us to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. We must consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees, carry out thorough criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify and build the Party, carry out educational revolution, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, seize the revolution and promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! After returning, we must definitely convey Chairman Mao's and the proletarian headquarters' voice directly to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and convey Chairman Mao's care for us poor and lower-middle peasants to the people of the entire province. In the future, we must do as Chairman Mao says, we will do as Chairman Mao guides, and we will move forward as Chairman Mao leads! We must achieve the goal of being redder the older we get, and the closer we follow Chairman Mao the older we get.

Fish cannot live without water, melons cannot grow without vines, and we poor and lower-middle peasants can never live without the red sun. We must closely follow and even more closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and implement and even more thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, making our Hongjin Production Brigade even redder, making Mao Zedong Thought bloom and bear fruit in our Hongjin Production Brigade, and strive to turn our Hongjin Production Brigade into a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

    把毛主席的声音原原本本地传达给贫下中农
    顾阿桃
    在国庆十九周年的大喜日子里，我在天安门城楼上又一次见到了我们的伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席他老人家满面红光，精神焕发，健步走来，不断地笑着向我们招手。毛主席他老人家身体非常非常健康，这是我伲贫下中农最大最大的幸福。我看到毛主席他老人家的伟大形象，激动得热泪直流，不知说什么才好，千言万语并作一句话：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    毛主席最关心我伲贫下中农，他老人家永远和我伲贫下中农心连心。
    毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席以及周总理走到我们代表面前时，毛主席他老人家亲切地和我握手，我怀着万分激动的心情对他老人家说：“我伲贫下中农敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”接着林副主席和周总理也都一一和我握了手。当林副主席亲切地喊我顾阿桃时，我说：“我伲贫下中农祝您身体健康！永远健康！您说：‘大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。’我伲一定照您的指示办，读一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话。”中央首长这样关心我们，我感到这是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部对我伲贫下中农最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，我伲贫下中农决心紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，在无产阶级司令部的统一号令下乘胜前进！
    我这次在天安门上见到我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席已经是第二次了。第一次见毛主席是在一九六六年的国庆节，那时无产阶级文化大革命刚刚兴起。毛主席说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”两年来我们遵照毛主席的伟大教导，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，打倒了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人，全国除台湾省外，各省、市、自治区全部建立了革命委员会，实现了祖国山河一片红，把国家的命运牢牢地掌握在工人阶级手里。今天，我又见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席，怎么能不高兴呢！天大地大不如党的恩情大，海深河深不如毛主席的恩情深。
    我伲洪泾大队是在毛主席和林副主席的亲切关怀下，在解放军同志的直接帮助下，树立起来的一个活学活用毛泽东思想的先进单位。毛主席对我伲越是关心，一小撮阶级敌人对我伲越恨。他们把我们取得的胜利，看成是眼中钉，肉中刺。一小撮党内走资派先是学着中国赫鲁晓夫的腔调诬蔑我伲贫下中农学习毛泽东思想是“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“形式主义”，说我“老太婆不能当典型”。文化大革命中我登上革命大批判的舞台，和这一小撮党内走资派展开了面对面的斗争，用我伲贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想的先进事迹，驳得他们目瞪口呆，不得不低头说：“我有罪，我有罪！”敌人越是反对我，就越加激发了我对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想无比深厚的阶级感情。在斗争中我伲活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，从胜利走向胜利。我们深深体会到：千胜利，万胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。天变地变，我们忠于毛主席的红心永不变；地动山摇，我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的决心永不动摇。
    林副主席的国庆重要讲话，传达了毛主席的声音和无产阶级司令部的新的战斗号令，让我们认真搞好斗、批、改。要巩固和发展革委会，搞好大批判，搞好清理阶级队伍，搞好整党建党，搞好教育革命，搞好精简机构，改革不合理的规章制度，抓革命、促生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我伲回去以后，一定要把毛主席和无产阶级司令部的声音，原原本本地传达给贫下中农，把毛主席对我伲贫下中农的关怀转告给全省人民。今后，我伲一定要做到毛主席怎么说，我伲就怎么做，毛主席怎么指引，我伲就怎么前进！做到人越老，心越红，年纪越大，跟毛主席越紧。
    鱼儿离不开水，瓜儿离不了秧，我伲贫下中农永生永世也离不开红太阳。我伲一定要紧跟再紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实再落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，使我们洪泾大队更红，使毛泽东思想在我们洪泾大队开红花，结大果，为把我们洪泾大队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗！
