The revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is a brilliant play that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. It successfully portrays the image of revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants who dare to rebel and dare to struggle, vividly embodying Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on seizing and consolidating political power through armed struggle.

After watching the play, reflecting on the struggles of the poor and lower-middle peasants before liberation, I have a lot to say. Let me start with the incense burner and the red-tasselled spear from the play!

The incense burner and the red-tasselled spear are two weapons used by Xi'er in her rebellion in "The White-Haired Girl." From Xi'er grabbing the incense burner to fight against her enemy Huang Shiren in the Huang family temple before liberation, to Xi'er shouldering the red-tasselled spear and joining the Eighth Route Army to embark on the revolutionary journey after liberation, these depict Xi'er's transformation from spontaneous resistance to conscious struggle. In her, I saw my past and the path that we, the thousands and millions of poor and lower-middle peasants, have walked.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The ruthless economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasantry by the landlord class compel the peasants to rise up repeatedly to resist the rule of the landlord class. ... In Chinese feudal society, only the class struggle of the peasants, the peasant uprisings, and the peasant wars are the true driving force of historical development."

Xi'er in "The White-Haired Girl" is a representative of the thousands and millions of oppressed and exploited poor and lower-middle peasants. Her tragic experiences in the old society are a reflection of the miserable lives of us poor and lower-middle peasants at that time; her hatred for the enemy, like a blazing fire, is the class hatred of us broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Facing the wolf-like enemy, she grabs the incense burner to smash and picks up the candleholder to strike, which is the revolutionary spirit of us poor and lower-middle peasants fighting to the death against the class enemy. "Fear not the howling of wolves and tigers, the heart of the wolf must be destroyed before one can be at peace." This is the heroic spirit of us poor and lower-middle peasants who fear no violence and dare to struggle.

However, to overthrow the evil reactionaries and to overthrow the reactionary regime, relying solely on such spontaneous resistance is not enough, relying solely on the incense burner and candleholder is not enough. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, by elevating spontaneous resistance to conscious struggle, by taking up arms to fight the enemy, can we liberate thousands and millions of Yanggezhuangs, seize political power, and make "countless Xi'ers stand up, and the rivers and mountains of China shine brightly."

Xi'er, after liberation, has avenged herself and washed away her hatred, but she has not forgotten the "Xi'ers" who have not yet been liberated. To save all the "Xi'ers" from suffering, to defend the political power we have seized, she shoulders the red-tasselled spear and follows Chairman Mao to make revolution forever. Seeing Xi'er shoulder the red-tasselled spear, I am overjoyed from the bottom of my heart. From throwing the incense burner to shouldering the red-tasselled spear, this is a great change, indicating Xi'er's growth, indicating that Xi'er has grown from a poor peasant girl into a revolutionary soldier.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power. Seizing political power requires the gun; consolidating political power also requires the gun. After the proletariat seizes political power, during the entire socialist period, class struggle still exists. This class struggle, in the final analysis, is still an issue of political power. The exploiting classes want to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship, and the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants want to consolidate our own political power. As long as class struggle exists for one day, we cannot put down the gun for one day; not only can we not put it down, but we must hold it even tighter. We must forever follow Chairman Mao, use the revolutionary gun to consolidate our proletarian dictatorship, and defend our ironclad proletarian mountains and rivers!

专栏：贫下中农赞革命样板戏

    从扔香炉到扛起红缨枪

    革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，是一出闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的好戏。它成功地塑造了敢于造反、敢于斗争的革命的贫下中农形象，生动地体现了毛主席关于武装夺取政权、巩固政权的光辉思想。
    看过戏，回想起解放前贫下中农的斗争生活，俺心里有不少话要说，现在就从戏里的香炉和红缨枪说起吧！
    香炉和红缨枪是《白毛女》中喜儿造反用的两件武器。从解放前喜儿在黄家佛堂里抓起香炉与仇人黄世仁搏斗，到解放后喜儿扛起红缨枪参加八路军踏上革命征途的描写，深刻地表明了喜儿从自发反抗到自觉斗争的过程。在她的身上，我看到了俺的过去，看到了咱们千百万贫下中农走过的道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。……在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”
    《白毛女》里的喜儿，就是千千万万受压迫受剥削的贫下中农的一个代表。她在旧社会里的悲惨遭遇，正是俺贫下中农当时苦难生活的写照；她那“烈火烧”一般的对敌人的仇恨，正是俺广大贫下中农的阶级仇恨。她面对豺狼般的敌人抓住香炉就砸，拿起烛台就打，正是俺贫下中农拚死和阶级敌人作斗争的革命造反精神。“狼嚎虎啸何所惧，不灭豺狼心不甘。”这就是俺贫下中农不畏强暴，敢于斗争的英雄本色。
    不过，要打倒万恶的反动派，要推翻反动政权，光靠这种自发的反抗是不够的，光靠香炉和烛台是不行的。只有在中国共产党的领导下，把自发的反抗上升到自觉的斗争，拿起枪杆子打敌人，才能解放千千万万个杨各庄，才能夺取政权，才能使“多少喜儿翻了身，锦绣河山放光彩”。
    翻了身的喜儿报了仇，雪了恨，但她并没有忘记还没有翻身的“喜儿”。为了解救所有的“喜儿”出苦难，为了保卫已经夺得的政权，她扛起红缨枪，跟着毛主席永远闹革命。看到喜儿扛起了红缨枪，俺打心眼里高兴。从扔香炉到扛起红缨枪，这是一个大变化，说明了喜儿的成长，说明了喜儿由一个贫农的女孩子成长为一个革命的战士。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。夺取政权，要靠枪杆子；巩固政权，也要靠枪杆子。在无产阶级取得政权以后，在整个社会主义阶段，还存在着阶级和阶级斗争。这种阶级斗争，归根到底，还是一个政权问题。剥削阶级要推翻我们的无产阶级专政，工人阶级和贫下中农要巩固我们自己的政权。只要阶级斗争还存在一天，我们就一天不能放下枪杆子；不但不能放下，而且要握得更牢更紧。我们要永远跟着毛主席，用革命的枪杆子，来巩固我们的无产阶级专政，捍卫我们无产阶级铁打的江山！
