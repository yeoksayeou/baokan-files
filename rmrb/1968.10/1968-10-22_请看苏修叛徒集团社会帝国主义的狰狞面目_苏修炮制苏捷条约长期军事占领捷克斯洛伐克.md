The Soviet revisionist clique recently forced the Czechoslovak revisionist clique to accept the so-called "Soviet-Czechoslovak agreement on the conditions for the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia," a treacherous treaty, in an attempt to "legalize" the Soviet revisionists' long-term military occupation of Czechoslovakia, to rely on force to permanently occupy Czechoslovakia and enslave the Czechoslovak people, and to create a legal basis for doing so. This is yet another dirty deal between the Soviet revisionists and the Czechoslovak revisionists since the Soviet revisionists sent troops to occupy Czechoslovakia in August this year, after their attempt to subjugate the Czechoslovak people with hundreds of thousands of troops failed, leaving them in a desperate situation.

In early and mid-October, the Soviet revisionist clique summoned Czechoslovak revisionist leaders Dubček, Černík, and others to Moscow for "talks" on signing this treaty, and on the 16th, they signed the treaty in Prague. The relevant agencies of both sides hurriedly completed all the procedures for approving the treaty using the "assembly line" method on the 18th and exchanged notes that evening, announcing that it would take effect immediately.

The Soviet revisionist clique has repeatedly claimed that it sent troops to occupy Czechoslovakia because the situation there was "abnormal." Moreover, the "agreement" reached at the first Moscow-Soviet meeting at the end of August had clearly stated that the Soviet occupying forces would "withdraw as the situation in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic normalizes." This time, the treaty signed, although it states that it is based on that agreement, does not mention the issue of the Soviet troops withdrawing as the situation in Czechoslovakia "normalizes," but instead proposes to "guarantee" the "security" of the so-called "socialist family" controlled by the Soviet revisionists, "to prevent the growing revanchist ambitions of West German militarism from invading," as an excuse for the Soviet occupying forces to remain in Czechoslovakia. The treaty uses the pretext that the Soviet troops are only "temporarily" stationed, but it does not specify how long this "temporary" period is, nor does it mention when the "security" of the so-called "family" of the Soviet revisionists will no longer need to be "defended." Instead, it stipulates that as long as the Soviet troops remain in Czechoslovakia, this treacherous treaty will be in effect. This is actually a regulation that the Soviet troops will carry out an indefinite military occupation of Czechoslovakia.

The treaty stipulates that the personnel, accompanying personnel, wives, children, and other direct relatives of the Soviet occupying forces can freely travel and reside in Czechoslovakia using various means of transportation, without the need for passports, visas, or customs and border checks. The Czechoslovak side must allocate some areas to be "controlled" by the Soviet army. In the "deployment areas" controlled by the Soviet invading army, if Soviet soldiers commit crimes, the Czechoslovak side is not allowed to intervene. According to these regulations, the Soviet invading army will be able to roam freely in Czechoslovakia, from the ground to the air, doing whatever they want, just like how the American imperialists can run rampant in South Vietnam.

Moreover, the treaty stipulates that no one in Czechoslovakia is allowed to resist the fascist occupation by the Soviet troops. Anyone who opposes the Soviet invading army will be considered as opposing the Czechoslovak army and will be held "responsible" for the same "crimes," and these people will be subjected to brutal suppression. If someone in Czechoslovakia resists the Soviet invading army and causes "damage" to the Soviet invading army or their families through "actions," the Czechoslovak side will also be responsible for "compensation."

The treaty blatantly tramples on Czechoslovakia's sovereignty, making Czechoslovakia essentially a protectorate of Soviet social imperialism. However, the Soviet revisionists shamelessly boast in the treaty about not "infringing" on Czechoslovakia's "sovereignty." The Soviet revisionists' long-term military occupation of Czechoslovakia, their lawlessness, suppression of the people, and direct interference in Czechoslovakia's internal affairs, while the Soviet revisionists in the treaty fabricate that they do not "interfere" in Czechoslovakia's "internal affairs." The Soviet revisionists' banditry is no different from the Japanese imperialists' savage invasion of China while talking about "friendship," "assistance," and "shared prosperity."

The treaty forged by the Soviet revisionists not only further exposes the savage face of Soviet social imperialism but also more profoundly reveals the weak nature of the Soviet paper tiger.

The Soviet revisionists brazenly sent troops to occupy Czechoslovakia on August 20, thinking they could manipulate it at will. However, things did not go as planned. Their aggressive actions provoked the resistance of the Czechoslovak people, opposition from the Soviet people, and condemnation from revolutionary people around the world. The Soviet revisionist clique became a rat that everyone wanted to beat, falling into an unprecedentedly isolated position, and the revisionist clique was in chaos. To quickly "stabilize" the situation in Czechoslovakia, the Soviet revisionist clique, in late August, forced the Czechoslovak revisionist clique at gunpoint to engage in a dirty deal with them in Moscow, issuing a so-called "Soviet-Czechoslovak Talks Communiqué." In this deal, the Soviet revisionists, in exchange for allowing the Dubček clique to continue in power, sought to quickly suppress the heroic struggle of the Czechoslovak people and to restore the disintegrating situation of the revisionist clique.

However, this move also failed. As soon as the "Talks Communiqué" was released, it provoked even greater anger among the Czechoslovak people. Broad masses of revolutionary people, despite the suppression of the Soviet troops, bravely engaged in various struggles, holding anti-Soviet military occupation demonstrations in various places, even attacking the Soviet troops with weapons. People in various places refused to supply food to the Soviet invading army, workers refused to build exhibition halls for the Soviet revisionists, and hotel staff refused to go to work because the Soviet troops were staying in the hotels. Many people solemnly swore: "Better death than slavery."

The Czechoslovak revisionist clique, under the threat of Soviet bayonets, continued to shamefully betray the Czechoslovak people. They have been carefully executing the August Moscow "Talks Communiqué," repeatedly demanding that the Czechoslovak people surrender to the Soviet revisionists. At the same time, the Czechoslovak revisionist clique, under the strong pressure of the resistance of the Czechoslovak people and to maintain their ruling position, has been resisting some of the Soviet revisionists' intentions to a certain extent. The Soviet revisionists, while using the Dubček clique, are also not entirely trusting it, and thus, they have been painstakingly trying to put together a more obedient puppet regime. The struggle between the Soviet revisionists and the Czechoslovak revisionists over this issue has never stopped.

Various facts indicate that the Soviet revisionists signed this treaty with the Czechoslovak revisionists to adapt to the needs of the U.S.-Soviet partnership in dividing the world and tightening global counter-revolutionary collusion. In recent periods, the Soviet revisionists have made many major concessions to the U.S. imperialists to obtain the U.S. imperialists' tacit approval of their series of aggressive actions in Czechoslovakia. The Soviet revisionists have sent a large number of diplomats to the West to engage in activities, bowing and scraping to the U.S. imperialists to express their unwillingness to change the tacitly agreed-upon spheres of influence, repeatedly guaranteeing the continued implementation of the policy of "coexistence" with the U.S. imperialists. On issues such as Vietnam and the Middle East, the Soviet revisionists have actively served the U.S. imperialists and have been repeatedly praised by the U.S. imperialists. A recent report by the Associated Press on the "Paris talks" between the U.S. and Vietnam revealed that U.S. officials are optimistic about reaching an agreement in the near future. The report said that their optimism stems from the Soviet revisionists' role in this regard. Another report by the same news agency also revealed that, under the "active encouragement" of the Soviet Union, the Middle East issue "can make significant progress." To curry favor with the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists recently made further deals with the U.S. imperialists on the Berlin issue. According to the New York Times, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko recently assured U.S. Secretary of State Rusk in a servile manner: "West Berlin will not be threatened by any forces from Eastern Europe."

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: Revolutionary parties and revolutionary people always have to undergo repeated education from both positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, to become mature and have the guarantee of victory. The Soviet revisionists' coercion of the Czechoslovak revisionists to sign this treacherous treaty will not only not save the Soviet revisionists but will also, like the steps the Soviet revisionists have taken since occupying Czechoslovakia, become another good negative example for the Czechoslovak people. This treaty has once again ignited the anger of the Czechoslovak people and has played a role in mobilizing them to further resist the Soviet revisionists.

According to reports, as soon as this treaty was signed, hundreds of protest letters were issued by revolutionary masses in just one region of Czechoslovakia. Many people saw through the Soviet revisionists' so-called "temporary stationing" of troops, pointing out that the Soviet revisionists' so-called "temporary stationing of troops" is a long-term military occupation, and this treaty is only to make the Soviet occupation "legal." After the news of the Czechoslovak National Assembly's approval of this treacherous treaty was announced, thousands of people gathered outside the National Assembly, shouting angrily: "Shameful! Shameful!" Some said: "We have been betrayed again." They condemned the Czechoslovak revisionist clique for "surrender and collaboration." The enraged masses held demonstrations and marches. Some workers said: "The Dubček revisionist clique, under the pressure of the Soviet revisionists, betrayed the Czechoslovak people. We have seen their true colors. We workers are revolutionary, and we will definitely seize back the power and put it back in our own hands." "Comrade Mao Zedong told us long ago that revisionism is the main danger at present, and the facts have completely proven that Comrade Mao Zedong's foresight is wise and correct." The Czechoslovak people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will surely awaken further and sweep away the Soviet revisionists, Czechoslovak revisionists, and other harmful elements, rebuilding a new socialist Czechoslovakia.

    请看苏修叛徒集团社会帝国主义的狰狞面目
    ——苏修炮制苏捷条约长期军事占领捷克斯洛伐克
    新华社二十一日讯　本社记者评述：苏修叛徒集团最近强使捷修集团接受了所谓苏捷“关于苏联军队暂时留驻捷克斯洛伐克境内的条件”的卖国条约，妄图为苏修对捷克斯洛伐克的长期军事占领“合法化”、依靠武力永久霸占捷克斯洛伐克和奴役捷克斯洛伐克人民制造法律根据。这是今年八月苏修出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克以来，以几十万大军压服捷克斯洛伐克人民的企图破产后，在处境狼狈的情况下同捷修进行的又一笔肮脏交易。它进一步暴露了苏修叛徒集团社会帝国主义的狰狞面目和纸老虎的虚弱本质。
    十月上旬和中旬，苏修集团连续两次把捷修头目杜布切克、切尔尼克等人召到莫斯科就签订这项条约进行了“会谈”，并于十六日在布拉格签订了这项条约。双方的有关机构在十八日急急忙忙地以快速“流水作业法”完成了批准条约的所有各项手续，并在当晚互换照会，宣布立即生效。
    苏修集团过去一再声称，它出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，是因为捷克斯洛伐克局势“不正常”，而且，八月底举行的第一次莫斯科苏捷会谈的“协议”还曾明确宣布，苏修占领军将“随着捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国局势正常化而撤出”。这次签订的条约，虽然也写明是根据那次协议商定的，但对苏修应随着捷克斯洛伐克“局势正常化”而撤军的问题绝口不谈，却提出什么“保证”苏修控制的所谓“社会主义大家庭”的“安全”，“免受西德军国主义势力的日益增长的复仇主义野心的侵犯”，作为苏修占领军继续赖在捷克斯洛伐克的借口。条约打着苏修只是“暂时”驻军的幌子，但条约并没有指明所谓“暂时”究竟是多长时间，也没有谈到苏修所谓“大家庭”的“安全”究竟何时才无需“保卫”，而是规定，苏修军队留驻捷境多久，这项卖国条约也就有效多久。这实际上就是规定，苏修军队将对捷克斯洛伐克实行无限期的军事占领。
    条约规定，苏修占领军的编制人员、随军人员、苏军人员的老婆、孩子和其他直系亲属等可以乘用各种各样交通工具在捷克斯洛伐克自由往来，长期居住，既不要护照、签证，也不受海关检查和国境检查。捷克斯洛伐克方面必须划出一些区域“拨给苏联军队支配”。在苏修侵略军“支配”的这些“部署区”，苏修军人犯罪，捷克斯洛伐克方面不得过问。按照这些规定，苏修侵略军将可以在捷克斯洛伐克境内，从地上到空中，横冲直闯，为所欲为，如同美帝国主义在越南南方可以任意横行霸道一样。
    不仅如此，条约还规定，捷克斯洛伐克的任何人都不得反击苏修军队的法西斯占领。谁要是反对苏修侵略军，就将被看作是反对捷克斯洛伐克军队，要“承担”同样的“责任”，就要对这些人进行残暴的镇压。如果捷克斯洛伐克有人反击苏修侵略军，以“行动”给苏修侵略军以至他们的家属造成了“损失”，捷克斯洛伐克方面还要负责“赔偿”。
    条约粗暴地践踏了捷克斯洛伐克的主权，使捷克斯洛伐克实际上沦为苏修社会帝国主义的保护国，而苏修在条约中却无耻地侈谈什么“并不侵犯”捷克斯洛伐克“主权”。苏修对捷克斯洛伐克实行长期军事占领，在那里为非作歹，镇压人民，直接插手捷克斯洛伐克内部事务，而苏修在条约中却胡诌什么他们“不干涉”捷克斯洛伐克“内政”。苏修的这种强盗行径，同日本帝国主义当年野蛮侵略中国却大谈什么“亲善”、“提携”、“共荣”云云，又有什么两样呢？
    苏修炮制的这一条约，不仅进一步暴露了苏修社会帝国主义的狰狞面目，也更加深刻地显露出苏修纸老虎的虚弱原形。
    苏修八月二十日悍然出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，本来以为可以随心所欲地加以摆布。但是，事与愿违，它的侵略行径，激起了捷克斯洛伐克人民的反抗，受到苏联人民的反对，遭到了全世界革命人民的谴责，苏修集团成了人人喊打的过街老鼠，陷入空前孤立的地位，修正主义集团内部乱作一团。为了迅速“稳定”捷克斯洛伐克的局势，苏修叛徒集团曾于八月下旬用刺刀逼迫捷修叛徒集团在莫斯科同他们进行了一笔肮脏的交易，抛出了一个所谓苏捷“会谈公报”。在这场交易中，苏修以允许杜布切克集团继续执政为条件，换取对捷修的控制，妄图迅速地把捷克斯洛伐克人民的英勇斗争镇压下去，并挽回修正主义集团分崩离析的局面。
    可是，苏修这一着依然失灵。“会谈公报”刚一出笼，就激起了捷克斯洛伐克人民更大的愤怒。广大革命群众不顾苏修军队的镇压，勇敢地进行了种种斗争，在各地举行了反对苏修军事占领的游行示威，甚至武装袭击苏修军队。各地人民拒绝向苏修侵略军队供应粮食，工人拒绝为苏修建立展览馆，旅馆服务员因苏修军队住进旅馆而拒绝上班。不少人庄严宣誓：“不自由，毋宁死。”
    捷修集团在苏修刺刀威胁之下，继续可耻地背叛捷克斯洛伐克人民。他们一直在小心翼翼地执行八月莫斯科“会谈公报”，再三要求捷克斯洛伐克人民向苏修投降。与此同时，捷修集团在捷克斯洛伐克人民反抗的强大压力下和为了维护自己的统治地位，对苏修的某些旨意也在进行一定的抵制。苏修一方面在利用杜布切克集团，另一方面对它又很不放心，因此，煞费苦心地想拼凑一个更加顺从于它的傀儡班子。苏修、捷修之间以这个问题为中心的明争暗斗，始终没有停止。
    种种事实表明，苏修同捷修签定这项条约，是为了适应美苏合伙瓜分世界、加紧全球反革命勾结的需要。最近一个时期以来，苏修向美帝又作出了许多重大的出卖，以换取美帝对它在捷克斯洛伐克一系列侵略行径的默许。苏修出动了大批外交官员在西方展开活动，卑躬屈膝地向美帝表白自己不想改变互有默契的势力范围，一再保证继续执行同美帝“共处”的政策。在越南、中东等问题上，苏修对美帝积极效劳，受到美帝的一再赞赏。合众国际社最近在谈到越美“巴黎会谈”的一篇报道中透露，美国官员“对于在最近将来就可以达成协议这一点是乐观的”。报道说，他们的乐观情绪的产生是由于苏修在这方面“发挥了作用”。这家通讯社的另一篇报道还透露，在“苏联的积极鼓励下”，中东问题“可以取得重大进展”。为了讨好美帝，苏修最近还拿柏林问题进一步同美帝作交易。据《纽约时报》透露，苏修外长葛罗米柯最近曾向美国国务卿腊斯克奴颜媚骨地保证说：西柏林“不会受到东欧的任何威胁”。
    伟大的领袖毛主席指出：革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。苏修逼迫捷修签订这一纸卖国条约，不仅救不了苏修的命，而且将象苏修出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克以后所采取的一个又一个步骤一样，成为捷克斯洛伐克人民的又一份很好的反面教材。这项条约再一次激起了捷克斯洛伐克人民的怒火，起了动员他们起来进一步反抗苏修的作用。
    据报道，这项条约刚一签订，仅在捷克斯洛伐克的一个地区，革命群众就发出了数百份抗议书。不少人看穿了苏修军队的所谓“暂时留驻”的骗局，他们指出，苏修的所谓“军队暂时留驻”就是长期军事占领，这项条约只不过是使苏修占领“合法化”而已。当捷克斯洛伐克国民议会批准这个卖国条约的消息传出后，聚集在国民议会外面的上千名群众气愤地高呼：“可耻！可耻！”有人说：“我们又一次被出卖了。”他们谴责捷修集团“投降和通敌”。群众义愤填膺地举行了示威游行。有的工人说：“杜布切克修正主义集团在苏修的压力下，出卖了捷克斯洛伐克人民，我们看清了他们的面目。我们工人是要革命的，我们一定要把政权夺回来，重新掌握在自己的手中。”“毛泽东同志很早就告诉我们，修正主义是当前主要的危险，事实完全证明了毛泽东同志的预见是英明正确的。”具有光荣革命传统的捷克斯洛伐克人民一定会进一步觉醒起来，把苏修、捷修等害人虫统统扫除掉，重建社会主义的新捷克斯洛伐克。
