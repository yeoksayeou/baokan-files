The workers of Beijing Knitting Factory, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, have been vigorously promoting revolution and production. They have completed their annual production plan two months and seventeen days ahead of schedule, triumphantly entering the year 1969.

The revolutionary workers of Beijing Knitting Factory, with the enthusiastic help of the comrades from the People's Liberation Army's 8341 Unit who were sent by Chairman Mao, have closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao. Since the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee on November 11 last year, they have carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, cleaned up the class ranks, rectified the Party organization, and carried out two rounds of organizational streamlining. 87% of the staff in various departments have been reassigned to the production frontline. At the same time, they have reformed unreasonable rules and regulations. The broad revolutionary workers have directed the boundless enthusiasm released during the struggle, criticism, and reform into production. They have spurred on their efforts, striven for the forefront, fully mobilized all positive factors, and greatly promoted the development of production. The output for the first and second quarters of this year increased by 8.6% compared to the same periods last year. The output for the third quarter increased by 75.25% compared to the same period last year. This year's output has exceeded the highest level since the factory was established.

The broad workers of Beijing Knitting Factory have turned their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao into actions by strictly following Chairman Mao's instructions. They have closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao. In July, they sent their outstanding representatives to participate in the Beijing Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, which entered Tsinghua University and stepped onto the political stage of the superstructure struggle, criticism, and reform. The great leader Chairman Mao presented the most precious gift of mangos to the Beijing Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and personally received the workers' representatives, greatly encouraging the workers of this factory. They said, "Chairman Mao supports us, the working class, and we must strive for Chairman Mao!" The workers who remained in the factory all vigorously promoted the revolution and production. Old worker Li Lanbo of the Third Division told his wife Li Xiangzhu, who participated in the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, "We must listen to Chairman Mao's words. You and your comrades must occupy the educational front, and we will definitely promote the revolution and production in the factory, becoming your rear support." Li Lanbo and the workers of the Printing Section worked hard and smartly, increasing the daily output of partial printing from 8,000 pieces to 13,000 pieces.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions that "our country has a population of 700 million, and the working class is the leading class," and "the working class must lead everything," the broad workers of Beijing Knitting Factory, inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have even more enthusiasm for promoting revolution and production. The Second Division, which usually produces 5,220 pieces of fleece clothing per day, proposed the slogan "Capture the daily production of 10,000 pieces and present a tribute to Chairman Mao." During the battle, when the machine in the Third Shift of the Third Team broke down, and the entire factory had already completed the task of 10,000 pieces and was ready to report the good news to Chairman Mao, their team was still short of 130 pieces. Other teams' comrades advised them to join the reporting team. They insisted on not doing so. Team leader Hao Shuxiu said, "Comrades can replace us in completing thousands and tens of thousands of tasks, but they cannot replace us in showing our loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao!" They quickly eliminated the machine fault, completing in 20 minutes what usually takes an hour, successfully completing the task, and happily joined the reporting team.

Thinking of the great leader Chairman Mao's deep affection for the working class, the broad revolutionary workers have an even greater hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in this factory. In the past, the capitalist roaders in the Party promoted material incentives and used money to corrupt the workers, with the total daily output of the Second Team of the Third Division being only 3,600 pieces. Now, the revolutionary workers have firmly established the idea of "driving for the revolution," with the daily output reaching more than 7,400 pieces. The workers, with deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi, dragged the capitalist roaders into the workshop and used a large number of facts to criticize them, making them speechless and forced to admit their crimes.

With the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the spiritual outlook of the broad revolutionary cadres has undergone tremendous changes. The factory revolutionary committee and the cadres of various teams all regard going deep into the workshops to participate in labor and blending with the worker masses as a concrete manifestation of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Where there are difficulties, they go there. More than 200 cadres reassigned to the production frontline have played an active role in promoting revolution and production. Zhao Yumei, the political instructor of the Sixth Team, who used to be the party branch secretary of the workshop and the director of the labor department, was high and mighty and detached from the masses. After the Cultural Revolution, he changed. Now, he goes deep into the workshops, blends with the workers, consults with the masses on matters, and directs production with Mao Zedong Thought. The workers call him "our good political instructor."

In the high tide of promoting revolution and production, the broad revolutionary workers all regard reforming unreasonable rules and regulations and carrying out technological innovations as practical actions to show their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. In just July, August, and September, the factory's revolutionary workers completed 17 relatively important technological innovations, with some innovation projects increasing production efficiency by several times.

Now, the broad revolutionary workers of Beijing Knitting Factory are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and have entered a new year in production. They say, "The achievements we have made in revolution and production are the victories of the great Mao Zedong Thought. They are the results of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and strictly following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of 'humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind.' We must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought even more diligently. In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, we will use greater achievements to bring glory to Chairman Mao and use new victories to perform new merits for the people."

    毛主席为工人阶级撑腰　工人阶级为毛主席争气
    北京针织总厂工人狠抓革命猛促生产
    提前两个多月胜利完成全年生产计划
    据新华社十七日讯  无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的北京针织总厂的工人阶级，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前两个月零十七天完成了全年生产计划，胜利地跨入了一九六九年。
    北京针织总厂广大革命职工，在毛主席派来的亲人——人民解放军八三四一部队支左人员的热情帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，于去年十一月十一日成立厂革命委员会以后，深入持久地开展了革命大批判，清理了阶级队伍，整顿了党的组织，进行了两次机构精简，有百分之八十七的科室人员下放到生产第一线，同时对不合理的规章制度进行了改革。广大革命职工把在斗、批、改中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到生产上去，鼓足干劲，力争上游，充分调动一切积极因素，大大促进了生产的发展。今年一、二季度产量与去年同时期相比，增加了百分之八点六，第三季度产量与去年同时期相比，又猛增百分之七十五点二五。今年的产量超过了建厂以来的最高水平。
    北京针织总厂的广大工人，把对毛主席的无限忠诚，落实到坚决按照毛主席的指示办事上。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在七月派出自己的优秀代表参加了首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队，开进清华大学，登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的政治舞台。伟大领袖毛主席向首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队赠送最珍贵的礼物芒果，并且亲自接见首都工人代表，极大地鼓舞了这个厂的工人，他们说：“毛主席为我们工人阶级撑腰，我们一定为毛主席争气！”留厂的工人，人人狠抓革命，猛促生产。三分厂的老工人栗兰波向参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的爱人李香竹说：“咱们一定要听毛主席的话，你和同志们一定要占领教育阵地，我们在厂里一定抓好革命，搞好生产，做你们的后盾。”栗兰波和印花车间的工人一起，猛干巧干，使局部印花由每日八千件增加到一万三千件。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级”，“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示后，北京针织总厂的广大工人在毛主席的最新指示鼓舞下，抓革命，促生产的干劲更足。平时日产五千二百二十件绒衣的二分厂，革命职工们提出了“拿下日产一万件，向毛主席敬献厚礼”的口号。在战斗过程中，三连三班的机器坏了，等全厂已经完成了一万件任务，准备向毛主席报喜时，她们班还差一百三十件，其他班的同志们劝她们同大伙一块去报喜。她们说什么也不肯，班长郝淑秀说：“同志们可以代替我们完成千件万件活，却代替不了我们向伟大领袖毛主席献忠心！”她们迅速地排除了机器故障，用二十分钟做完了平时一小时做的活，胜利地完成了任务，高高兴兴地赶上了报喜队伍。
    想到伟大领袖毛主席对工人阶级比海洋还深的恩情，广大革命职工对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂代理人推行的一整套反革命修正主义路线更加憎恨。过去，党内走资派大搞物质刺激，用金钱腐蚀工人，总厂三连二班日产量只有三千六百件；现在革命职工牢固地树立了“为革命而开车”的思想，日产量一下子达到了七千四百多件。工人们怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，把走资派揪到车间，用大量事实批得他目瞪口呆，只好低头认罪。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，广大革命干部的精神面貌发生了巨大变化。厂革委会和各连在职干部，都把深入车间参加劳动，同工人群众打成一片看作是忠于毛主席的具体表现，那里有困难，他们就到那里去。下放到生产第一线的二百多名干部，在抓革命促生产中发挥了积极作用。六连指导员赵玉珉，过去担任车间党支部书记和厂劳动科长时，高高在上，脱离群众。经过文化大革命，他变了样。现在，他深入车间，和工人打成一片，遇事同群众商量，用毛泽东思想指挥生产，工人称他为“我们的好指导员”。
    在抓革命促生产的高潮中，广大革命职工都把改革不合理的规章制度，大搞技术革新，看作是对伟大领袖毛主席敬献忠心的实际行动。仅七、八、九三个月，全厂革命职工搞成的比较重要的技术革新就有十七项，有些革新项目使生产效率成倍提高。
    现在，北京针织总厂的广大革命职工满怀革命豪情在生产上跨入了新的年度。他们说，我们在革命和生产上已经取得的成就，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线办事的成果。我们一定牢记伟大领袖毛主席的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，更加努力活学活用毛泽东思想，在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，用更大的成就，为毛主席争光，用新的胜利，为人民再立新功。
