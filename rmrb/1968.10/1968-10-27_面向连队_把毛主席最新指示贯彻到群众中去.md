The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, has produced a new style of work among the Chinese people. The main features of this style are the combination of theory with practice, close ties with the masses, and self-criticism." Following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, our political department has, over the past few years, insisted on facing the companies, linking with the masses, and helping the companies to lead with Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, and raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad cadres and soldiers. This has strengthened the construction of the grassroots level of the troops; at the same time, it has greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of the political department personnel.

Thinking of the companies, rooting in the companies

In the past few years, we have been deeply involved in the grassroots level, linking with the masses, and our thoughts have been relatively conscious, achieving certain results. However, in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have encountered new problems: most of the cadres in the political department went to execute the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, and only four or five people were left to insist on the work. In order to continue to insist on being deeply involved in the grassroots level and linking with the masses in the new situation, we once tried to find a solution from the methods. However, the more we tried, the more we felt that there were fewer people, the heavier the tasks, and the more difficult it was to be deeply involved in the grassroots level. Some comrades said: "With just a few people, it would be good enough to manage the appearance. Even if we can't go down, it is understandable." For a period of time, we stayed in the office more and linked with the masses less; the company cadres came up more, and we went down less. Staying in the office or being deeply involved in the grassroots level, is this a matter of method or a matter of style? We brought this question to re-study Chairman Mao's teachings: "What distinguishes our Party from any other political party is that we have the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people." We realized that staying in the office, floating above, relying on making phone calls, listening to reports, asking for materials, and letting the companies serve the office, is the bourgeois bureaucratic style of being detached from the masses; facing the companies, being deeply involved in the grassroots level, never being detached from the masses, thinking of the companies, exerting efforts for the companies, rooting in the companies, and wholeheartedly serving the companies, this is in line with the Party's excellent style of closely linking with the masses cultivated by Chairman Mao in person. Therefore, no matter how the situation changes, the style of facing the companies and linking with the masses must never change. Everyone resolutely expressed: We must be determined to walk out of the office, link with the masses, be deeply involved in the grassroots level, and strive for the "four goods."

Last spring, most of the companies in our regiment executed the task of supporting agriculture and were dispersed in twenty communes and more than one hundred production brigades. In the fierce and complex class struggle, it was necessary to help the companies strengthen political and ideological work in a timely manner and firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle. We felt that: the companies went to the front line of the struggle, and the political organs should go to the front line; wherever the soldiers went, the cadres of the political organs should follow. We packed our bags, crossed mountains and rivers, and went to various companies supporting agriculture to understand the situation and help solve problems. We passed down Chairman Mao's latest instructions and brought back the situation of the companies implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We also summarized ten "how to do" experiences of how the companies on the front line of supporting agriculture carried out daily reading and how to correctly treat the masses, which were welcomed by the companies.

The first time the Fourth Company executed the production task, it had no experience, and the political instructor went to the school to conduct military training, and the company commander went to the battalion to take up a post. The company was left with only the deputy company commander and a platoon leader, feeling that the work was difficult and the pressure was great. We then sent two cadres to the Fourth Company to take up posts, assisting the deputy company commander to further carry out the revolutionary criticism, grasp the education of the two-line struggle, and help the Fourth Company to further launch a new upsurge of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the whole company, and the various work of the company showed a new situation. The cadres and soldiers of the Fourth Company said with emotion: "Every time we encounter difficulties, the comrades of the political department always think of us and come down to help us in time. We welcome such cadres of the political department."

The cadres of our political department deeply felt that the fewer the personnel in the office, the more things there are, the more we should face the companies and closely link with the masses. In this way, the office and the companies can be more closely linked together, and we can work together to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Efforts are made on key points, and effects are achieved on the whole

In May this year, during the education of the two-line struggle, we found that some companies did not grasp the revolutionary criticism tightly. In order to gain experience in carrying out the revolutionary criticism in the companies, we sent the young cadre Li Daming to the Fifth Company three times.

Li Daming went to the Fifth Company for the first time and found that the Fifth Company had insufficient understanding of the significance of the revolutionary criticism. Li Daming, in view of this situation, helped the Fifth Company to set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class, seriously studied Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, making everyone realize that carrying out the revolutionary criticism is an important way to raise the consciousness of the two-line struggle. With the improvement of consciousness, the party branch strengthened the leadership of the revolutionary criticism, and the revolutionary criticism in the whole company was carried out vigorously. The political department promoted the experience of the Fifth Company, and the whole regiment launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism.

However, the revolutionary criticism in some companies was not deep and lively. Li Daming, with this problem in mind, went to the Fifth Company for the second time and found that the canteen of the Fifth Company adopted the method of combining the class thoughts in the canteen, studying Chairman Mao's teachings, criticizing the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, and drawing the line between the two lines, making the revolutionary criticism lively and vivid, both deeply and frequently. Li Daming summarized the experience of the canteen and promoted it throughout the regiment, making the revolutionary criticism go deeper.

Li Daming went to the Fifth Company for the third time and, together with the cadres and soldiers of the company, practiced and summarized the experience of combining the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness to carry out the revolutionary criticism. After the experience of the Fifth Company was promoted, the revolutionary criticism in the whole regiment was further promoted, making the revolutionary criticism in the whole regiment carried out vigorously and solidly, with one high tide following another.

Through Li Daming's three visits to the Fifth Company, we deeply felt that: as the great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "In all the practical work of our Party, correct leadership always comes from the masses and goes to the masses." The cadres and soldiers of the companies are on the front line of the struggle and have rich practical experience. The responsibility of the leading organs is to timely discover, boldly support, seriously summarize, and enthusiastically promote the good thoughts and experiences of the masses, and vigorously carry forward the positive factors, guiding the masses to advance victoriously along the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao.

Following the lead, grasping the bottom to promote the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions

In July this year, the propaganda cadre Fan Guhong participated in the preliminary evaluation of the "four goods" in the Fourth Company. He heard from the radio Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "colleges must still be run, I am mainly talking about colleges of science and engineering, but the system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and proletarian politics must be in command, following the road of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from workers. We must select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, and after studying in school for a few years, they should return to production practice." He immediately studied with the cadres of the company and helped the company to specifically analyze the ideological situation of the new soldiers who were intellectuals. He suggested that the party branch of the company should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasp the education of them. The new soldier Feng Yue was a high school graduate. In the old school, he was poisoned by the revisionist educational line and had the idea of looking down on labor and peasants. After coming to the company, he looked down on the soldiers from the countryside. Fan Guhong then studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with him, had many heart-to-heart talks with him, and guided him to consciously accept reform in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought in the army, humbly learn from the comrades of worker and peasant origin. With the help of Fan Guhong, Feng Yue indignantly denounced the evil revisionist educational line, arousing his deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. After going to the canteen, he learned from the comrades of worker and peasant origin everywhere, fearing neither dirt nor hard work, starting from small things, and reforming his non-proletarian thoughts. Soon, the comrades reflected that he "has a bit of the flavor of workers, peasants, and soldiers." Feng Yue said with deep feelings: "Only by putting down the airs and humbly learning from the 'rough' can one cleanse the poison stamped on oneself from the old educational system."

We felt that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the beacon of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and also the beacon of the revolutionary construction of the companies. Therefore, our political department regards helping the companies to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the overriding task. We conduct investigations and research in the companies, which are investigations and research on the new situations and problems in the process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions; we go deep into the companies to help with the work, which is to help the cadres and soldiers of the companies to implement Chairman Mao's every latest instruction from thought to action; we go deep into the companies to summarize experiences, which is to summarize the new experiences of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and promoting the construction of the companies.

Being a student of the masses to promote one's own thought revolutionization

In the situation of fewer personnel and heavier tasks, our political department faces the companies and is deeply involved in the grassroots level, and there is also a struggle in thoughts. Sometimes, when encountering some difficulties in being deeply involved in the companies, we can't stay; when there is a little "business" in the office, we run back. During a rotation of the "three supports, two militaries" personnel, some comrades in our political department wanted to use this opportunity to increase a few people for the office. Soon, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "organizing a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre group" were issued, which gave us a great education. At this time, the first page and the first column of the *Liberation Army Daily* published our political department's summary of the experience of our regiment's leftist personnel helping the revolutionary committee of the state-owned Hancheng Farm to implement the policy of reducing personnel and increasing efficiency, which also had a great impact on our thoughts. We helped the local units to summarize the experience, emphasizing that they should closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and implement the policy of reducing personnel and increasing efficiency. Why did we want to increase personnel? We helped the local units to summarize the experience, emphasizing that they should link with the masses and be deeply involved in the grassroots level. Why did we want to run back? Everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to link with the masses." We realized that the key is that the thought of closely linking with the masses has not taken root in our minds.

Therefore, we took the companies as the best classroom to promote thought revolutionization, with the spirit of "being willing to be a student," humbly learning from the soldiers and the companies. The propaganda cadre Zhao Sien went to the Fourth Company to take up a post. The Fourth Company's cadres and soldiers had a large number of vivid examples of achieving thought revolutionization, which deeply educated him. The soldiers, in order to implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting production," with unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, drilled wells in the muddy water with ice chips, and their fighting spirit was very high; the deputy company commander Heo Xiuyao worked diligently and conscientiously, and went with the soldiers in the wind and rain. The soldiers called him the "old yellow cow" who served the people. These vivid and moving examples, Zhao Sien saw them with his own eyes and remembered them in his heart. Comparing himself, he had a fierce struggle in his thoughts. He studied the "Three Articles" over and over again, exposing all the active thoughts that he dared not show in the office in the past, and had a revolution in the depths of his soul. He sincerely asked his comrades for help, flushing out the muddy water of bourgeois thoughts in his mind, and established a deep class feeling with the soldiers. The soldiers had words to talk to him, had things to ask him for help, and regarded him as a member of the company. Zhao Sien had a deep feeling: "Only by being deeply involved in the masses and being willing to be a student of the masses can Chairman Mao's great teachings on closely linking with the masses take root in one's mind, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions can be implemented in one's thoughts."

In the past two years, our regiment's political department has insisted on facing the companies and closely linking with the masses. The thoughts and work style of the office cadres have been completely renewed. Five comrades in the political department have become active elements in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The number and quality of the "four goods" companies in the whole regiment have increased year by year. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings on closely linking with the masses, forever face the companies, be deeply involved in reality, link with the masses, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's military line, implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and do a better job in the revolutionary construction of the office.

### 面向连队　把毛主席最新指示贯彻到群众中去

    面向连队　把毛主席最新指示贯彻到群众中去
    人民解放军北京部队第二次四好连队代表大会代表　装甲兵某团政治处
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“以马克思列宁主义的理论思想武装起来的中国共产党，在中国人民中产生了新的工作作风，这主要的就是理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风。”我们政治处遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，近几年来，坚持面向连队、联系群众，帮助连队用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，提高了广大指战员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，加强了部队的基层建设；同时，也大大地促进了政治处人员的思想革命化。
    心往连队想，根往连队扎
    前几年，我们深入基层、联系群众，思想上比较自觉，取得了一定的成绩。但是，在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，我们遇到了新问题：政治处大多数干部去执行“三支”“两军”任务，经常坚持工作的只有四、五个人。为了在新的情况下，继续坚持深入基层、联系群众，我们曾试图从方法上打主意。可是，拨拉来拨拉去，越觉得人员少，越觉得任务重，越觉得深入基层有困难。有的同志说：“就这么几个人，能应付应付门面就算不错了。就是下不去，也是有情可原的。”在一段时间里，我们蹲机关多了，联系群众少了；连队干部上来多了，我们深入下去少了。蹲在机关还是深入基层，这究竟是个方法问题，还是个作风问题？我们带着这个问题，重温了毛主席的教导：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。”我们认识到：蹲在机关、浮在上面，光靠打电话、听汇报、要材料，让连队为机关服务，这是脱离群众的资产阶级官僚主义作风；面向连队，深入基层，一刻也不脱离群众，心往连队想，劲往连队使，根往连队扎，全心全意为连队服务，这才符合毛主席亲自培育的党的密切联系群众的优良作风。因此，情况千变万变，面向连队、联系群众的作风永远不能变。大家坚决表示：要下狠心走出机关，联系群众，深入基层，大抓四好。
    去年春天，我们团大部分连队执行支农任务，分散在二十个公社、一百多个生产大队。在激烈复杂的阶级斗争中，需要不失时机地帮助连队加强政治思想工作，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。我们觉得：连队走上斗争的第一线，政治机关就要到第一线去；战士们到哪里，政治机关的干部就要跟到哪里。我们打起背包，翻山越岭，分头深入到各个支农的连队，了解情况，帮助解决问题。我们把毛主席的最新指示传下去，把连队落实毛主席最新指示的情况带上来，并总结了连队在支农斗争第一线上怎样搞好天天读、怎样正确对待群众等十个“怎么办”，受到了连队的欢迎。
    四连第一次执行生产任务，没有经验，指导员又去学校搞军训，连长到营里代职。连里只剩下副连长和一个排长，感到工作困难，压力很大。我们就先后抽出两名干部到四连代职，协助副连长进一步开展了革命大批判，大抓了两条路线斗争的教育，帮助四连进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮，调动了全连人员的积极性，连队各项工作都有了新的气象。四连的干部战士感动地说：“每当我们遇到困难的时候，政治处的同志总是想着我们，及时下来帮助我们，这样的机关干部我们欢迎。”
    我们政治处的同志深深体会到，机关人员越少，事情越多，越要面向连队，密切联系群众。这样，才能把机关和连队更加紧紧地联系在一起，齐心协力落实毛主席的最新指示。
    功夫下在点上，效果落在面上
    今年五月，在进行两条路线斗争教育中，我们发现有的连队对革命大批判抓得不紧。为了取得连队开展革命大批判的经验，我们派青年干事李大民三下五连。
    李大民第一次下五连，发现五连存在着对革命大批判的意义认识不足的问题。李大民针对这种情况，帮助五连开办了毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，使大家认识到，开展革命大批判，是提高两条路线斗争觉悟的重要途径。认识提高了，支部加强了对革命大批判的领导，全连革命大批判热火朝天地开展了起来。政治处推广了五连的经验，全团掀起了革命大批判的高潮。
    可是，有的连队革命大批判搞得不深、不活。李大民带着这个问题，第二次下到五连，发现五连炊事班采取结合班里活思想、学习毛主席的教导、批判中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论、划清两条路线的界线的方法，把革命大批判搞得生动活泼，既深入又经常。李大民总结了炊事班的经验，又在全团推广，使革命大批判深入了一步。
    李大民第三次下五连，和连队干部战士一起实践，一起总结了把批修和斗私结合起来开展革命大批判的经验。五连的经验推广后，进一步推动了全团的革命大批判，使全团革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实，一个高潮接着一个高潮。
    通过李大民三下五连，我们深深体会到：正如伟大领袖毛主席教导的：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”连队干部、战士处在斗争第一线，有丰富的实践经验，领导机关的责任就是要及时发现、大胆支持、认真总结、热情推广群众中的好思想、好经验，大力发扬积极因素，引导群众沿着毛主席的伟大战略部署胜利前进。
    跟上头，抓下头促进毛主席最新指示的落实
    今年七月，宣传股长范古璜在四连参加四好初评，他从广播里听到毛主席关于“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”的最新指示后，立即和连队干部一起学习，并帮助连队具体分析了新战士中知识分子的思想状况，建议连队党支部遵照毛主席的最新指示，抓紧对他们进行教育。新战士冯跃，是个高中毕业生。在旧学校受修正主义教育路线的毒害，沾染了轻视劳动、轻视工农的思想。到连队以后，对农村来的战士看不起。范古璜便和他一起学习毛主席的最新指示，多次和他谈心，引导他自觉地在部队这个毛泽东思想大学校里接受改造，虚心向工农出身的同志学习。在范古璜的帮助下，冯跃愤怒控诉了万恶的修正主义教育路线，激发了他对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨。他到炊事班以后，处处向工农出身的同志学习，不怕脏，不怕累，从点滴做起，改造自己的非无产阶级思想。不久，同志们反映他“有点工农兵的味道了”。冯跃深有感触地说：“只有放下臭架子，老老实实地向‘大老粗’学习，才能清除掉自己身上从旧教育制度沾染来的毒素。”
    我们体会到，毛主席的最新指示，是无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯，也是连队革命化建设的指路明灯。因此，我们政治处把帮助连队落实毛主席最新指示，作为压倒一切的中心任务。我们深入连队搞调查研究，就是调查和研究贯彻执行毛主席最新指示过程中的新情况、新问题；我们深入连队帮助工作，就是帮助连队干部战士从思想到行动切实落实毛主席的每一条最新指示；我们深入连队总结经验，就是总结落实毛主席最新指示、推动连队建设的新经验。
    做群众的小学生促进自身思想革命化
    我们政治处在人员少、任务重的情况下面向连队，深入基层，思想上也是有斗争的。有时，深入连队碰到了一些困难就蹲不住，机关有点什么“业务”就往回跑。在一次轮换“三支”“两军”人员时，我们政治处有的同志就想乘此机会给机关增加几个人。不久，毛主席关于“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示发表了，使我们受到很大的教育。就在这时，《解放军报》头版头条刊登了我们政治处总结的我团支左人员帮助国营汉沽农场革委会实行精兵简政的经验，也对我们的思想震动很大。我们政治处帮助地方总结经验，强调人家要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的最新指示，实行精兵简政，我们自己为什么又要增加人员？我们帮助地方总结经验，强调人家要联系群众，深入基层，我们自己为什么又想往回跑？大家反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”认识到，关键还是密切联系群众的思想没有在头脑里扎根。
    于是，我们把连队作为促进思想革命化的最好课堂，以“甘当小学生的精神”，虚心向战士学习，向连队学习。宣传干事赵思恩到四连代职，四连干部战士实现思想革命化的大量生动事例，深深教育了他。战士们为了落实毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的指示，怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，在结了冰碴的泥水里打井，斗志非常旺盛；副连长郝秀尧工作一向勤勤恳恳、兢兢业业，和战士们风里来，雨里去，战士们称他是为人民服务的“老黄牛”。这一桩桩、一件件生动感人的事例，赵思恩看在眼里，记在心上，比比自己，思想上展开了激烈的斗争，他一遍又一遍地学习“老三篇”，把过去在机关不敢亮出来的活思想统统都亮了出来，在灵魂深处爆发革命，诚恳地要求同志们帮助，冲刷头脑中资产阶级的污泥浊水，和战士们建立了深厚的阶级感情。战士们有话找他谈，有事找他帮，把他当成了连队的一员。赵思恩深有体会地说：“只有深入到群众中去，甘当群众的小学生，才能使毛主席关于密切联系群众的伟大教导在头脑中扎下根子，才能使毛主席的最新指示在自己思想上落实。”
    近两年来，我们团政治处坚持面向连队，密切联系群众，机关干部思想面貌和工作面貌焕然一新。政治处有五个同志成为活学活用毛主席著作积极分子；全团四好连队的数量年年有所增加，质量年年有所提高。我们决心遵循毛主席关于密切联系群众的伟大教导，永远面向连队，深入实际，联系群众，坚决贯彻毛主席的建军路线，落实毛主席一系列最新指示，把机关的革命化建设搞得更好。
