According to a report by the Albanian newspaper *Warrior*, on September 28, the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, wrote a reply to the family of Safet Zelorari, an exemplary soldier who died a glorious death during a patrol. In the letter, Comrade Hoxha highly praised Safet's noble qualities and the patriotism and socialist consciousness of his family, and encouraged Safet's family to advance forever under the leadership of the Party in the struggle for socialist construction and the defense of the motherland.

Comrade Hoxha's letter said that Safet consciously fulfilled his lofty patriotic duty. During his short period of service, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to his work and became an exemplary soldier. Comrade Hoxha said that now, the Party has cultivated many such glorious and loyal sons throughout the country. The people and youth of Albania will forever remember Safet.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out in the letter that our entire socialist motherland is now in the process of continuously leaping forward to the heights of socialism. Due to the tireless work of the Party, the Albanian people are continuously raising their consciousness in socialist construction and in the struggle to defend the motherland. Now, everyone no longer just considers the narrow interests of the family, but considers the happiness of the entire people and the defense of the victory fruits obtained by the blood and sweat of the thousands of martyrs and heroes of Albania with patriotic spirit.

In the letter, Comrade Hoxha highly praised the patriotism of Safet's father, mother, and sister. Comrade Hoxha said that he has ordered Safet's weapon to be handed over to his sister Natasha, and wishes Natasha to take up the weapon in honor and advance forever on the Party's path that her brother had firmly walked.

Previously, Safet's father, mother, and sister had written a letter to Comrade Hoxha. In the letter, they expressed their hope that Safet's sister Natasha would take up Safet's weapon and continue the fight. The letter also said, "Let the imperialists, revisionists, and their lackeys listen: the Albanian people are prepared and will not allow the enemy to touch even a blade of grass on Albanian soil."

This young militia, with boundless hatred for U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, is determined to inherit the glorious traditions of the revolutionary forerunners and build and defend the socialist motherland.

    高度赞扬萨费特的高贵品质和爱国主义精神
    勉励战士家属在社会主义建设和保卫祖国的斗争中永远前进
    新华社地拉那四日电　据阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》报道：阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，九月二十八日给在一次执勤中光荣牺牲的模范战士萨费特·泽洛拉里的家属写了一封回信，高度赞扬萨费特的高贵品质及其家属的爱国主义精神和社会主义觉悟，并勉励萨费特的家属在劳动党的领导下，在社会主义建设和保卫祖国的斗争中，永远前进。
    霍查同志的信说，萨费特十分自觉地执行着崇高的爱国主义义务，他在短短的服役期间，全力以赴地投入了工作，成了模范战士。霍查同志说，现在，劳动党已经在全国各地培养了许多象萨费特这样光荣忠实的儿子。阿尔巴尼亚全国人民和青年将永远纪念萨费特。
    霍查同志在信中指出，现在，我们整个社会主义祖国正处在向社会主义高峰不断跃进的过程中。由于劳动党不倦地工作，阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义建设的劳动中和在保卫祖国的斗争中不断提高觉悟。现在，我们每个人都不再是光考虑家庭的狭隘利益，而是考虑全国人民的幸福，考虑以爱国主义精神保卫由阿尔巴尼亚成千上万的烈士和英雄勤劳的人民用血汗取得的胜利果实。
    霍查同志在信中高度赞扬萨费特的父亲、母亲和妹妹的爱国主义精神。霍查同志说，我已经命令把萨费特用过的武器交给他的妹妹娜塔莎，并祝娜塔莎光荣地拿起武器，沿着她哥哥坚定地走过的党的道路永远前进。
    在这以前，萨费特的父亲、母亲和妹妹曾写信给霍查同志。他们在信中表示，希望让萨费特的妹妹娜塔莎拿起萨费特生前用过的武器，继续战斗。信中还说，让帝国主义者、修正主义者及其仆从们听着，阿尔巴尼亚人民已经作好了准备，绝不允许敌人碰阿尔巴尼亚国土上的一草一木。

    在恩维尔·霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的培育下，阿尔巴尼亚新的一代正在茁壮成长。这个小民兵，怀着对美帝、苏修的无比仇恨，决心继承革命先辈的光荣传统，建设和保卫社会主义祖国。
