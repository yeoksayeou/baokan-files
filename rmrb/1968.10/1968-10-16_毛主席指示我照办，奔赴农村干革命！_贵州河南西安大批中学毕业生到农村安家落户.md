In accordance with the series of latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, large numbers of high school and middle school graduates in Guizhou, Henan, and Xi'an have rushed to the countryside to settle down and make revolution. So far, more than 6,500 high school and middle school graduates have already arrived in the countryside to settle down. In addition, large numbers of high school and middle school graduates are about to rush to the countryside.

The broad masses of high school and middle school graduates in Guizhou Province, after more than two years of tempering and testing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have continuously raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They are determined to follow the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao and go to the forefront of the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside to experience storms and hardships, see the world, get dirty, and forge a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They proudly declare to Chairman Mao: "We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. In the great storms, we will temper our red hearts. Chairman Mao instructs us, and we will follow his instructions to rush to the countryside to make revolution."

"The students trained in the old-type schools are mostly or largely able to combine with workers and peasants. Some of them have made inventions and innovations, but they must be re-educated by workers and peasants under the leadership of the correct line, and their old ideas must be thoroughly changed. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers and peasants." Chairman Mao's latest instruction further points out the direction for intellectuals to advance, greatly educating and inspiring the broad masses of high school and middle school graduates in the entire province, and further strengthening their resolve to follow the path of combining with workers and peasants. They have enthusiastically signed up to go to the mountains and countryside, and many Red Guards who work in the school revolutionary committees have also actively taken the lead in signing up to go to the most difficult places.

The revolutionary action of sending knowledge youth to the mountains and countryside has received firm support from the revolutionary committees at all levels in the province and the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary parents. They have expressed their determination to learn humbly from the poor and lower-middle peasants, change their non-proletarian world outlook, and temper themselves into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the broad masses of graduates from middle schools in Henan Province have enthusiastically gone to the mountains and countryside, following the path of combining with workers and peasants. So far, the entire province has sent 220,000 middle school graduates to the agricultural front lines to settle down in the countryside. They are determined to accept re-education from workers and peasants and, in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment in the countryside, temper their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

During the distribution of graduates, the revolutionary committees of various middle schools have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The broad masses of graduates in these classes have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the brilliant works of the "Old Three Articles," deeply realizing that knowledge youth can only follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao to combine with workers and peasants, and thus temper themselves into successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Many responsible persons of school revolutionary mass organizations have, through criticizing and repudiating themselves and modifying and criticizing the bourgeoisie, taken the lead in going to the mountains and countryside, setting a good example for the broad masses of middle school graduates.

Since the mighty Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of workers entered the schools, they have, through propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carrying out class education, pushed the work of organizing middle school graduates to go to the mountains and countryside to a new high level. The middle school graduates in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Jiaozuo, and Anyang have, after being educated by the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, gone to the countryside in large numbers.

Recently, a batch of high school and middle school graduates in the Xi'an area, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, have rushed to the front lines of agricultural production to settle down, determined to accept re-education from workers and peasants, thoroughly change their world outlook, and contribute their strength to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland.

After more than two years of tempering and testing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of high school and middle school graduates in the Xi'an area have greatly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao's instructions on re-educating intellectuals have greatly inspired and educated them. They excitedly said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions further point out the only correct direction for intellectuals to combine with workers and peasants. We must firmly follow the path of combining with workers and peasants, making ourselves proletarian intellectuals who serve workers and peasants, and become reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Some graduates who have already served as members or committee members of the school revolutionary committees have enthusiastically taken the lead in signing up to go to the mountains and countryside.

Many production brigade leadership cadres have made proper arrangements for the settlement of knowledge youth in the countryside. As soon as the broad revolutionary knowledge youth arrive in the countryside, they immediately throw themselves into the fierce class struggle and production struggle, working together with the poor and lower-middle peasants to seize the revolution and promote production, and are welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.
