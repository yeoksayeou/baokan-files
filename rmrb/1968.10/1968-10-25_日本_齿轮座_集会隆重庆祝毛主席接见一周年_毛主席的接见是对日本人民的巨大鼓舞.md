Tokyo, October 24 (Xinhua) - The Japanese "Gear Playhouse" troupe held a grand gathering in Yamaguchi City on October 23 to celebrate the first anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's reception of the entire delegation of the "Gear Playhouse" troupe visiting China. The attendees repeatedly shouted: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

That noon, the members of the "Gear Playhouse" troupe, wearing shiny Mao badges on their chests, joyfully gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. At this moment, the solemn melody of "The East is Red" echoed through the venue. The members of "Gear Playhouse" recalled the happiest moment and scene of one year ago when Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao received them at the Great Hall of the People. They spontaneously applauded enthusiastically for a long time.

At 6:30 PM, the entire "Gear Playhouse" troupe held a celebration gathering. Representatives from the Japanese Communist Party Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Leftist faction) and local workers, youth, and women were invited to attend the celebration.

In the center of the front of the venue, portraits of Chairman Mao and a commemorative group photo of Chairman Mao with the entire delegation of the "Gear Playhouse" visiting China one year ago were hung.

On the front wall, there was also an important inscription written by Chairman Mao six years ago to Japanese workers: "As long as the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism are combined with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is undoubted."

Fujikawa Natsuko, the leader of the "Gear Playhouse" visiting delegation, spoke at the meeting. She said that Chairman Mao's reception of us is an immense encouragement to the Japanese people. After the delegation returned to Japan, to report to the Japanese people the great news of Chairman Mao's reception of the "Gear Playhouse" visiting delegation, we staged the scene of that time into a performance. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team performed in various parts of Japan. Many audiences were moved to tears. They realized Chairman Mao's concern for the Japanese people and the support of the seven hundred million Chinese people for the Japanese people, which strengthened the fighting spirit of the Japanese people.

Fujikawa emphasized that we must engrave Chairman Mao's great inscription to Japanese workers in our hearts, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the literary and artistic line of serving the revolution, and stride forward on the revolutionary path.

Fujikawa condemned the anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people conspiracies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kyuichi Tokuda. She also pointed out that the Japanese people must expose and thoroughly smash the reactionary policies of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and resolutely defend the world revolutionary stronghold - China.

The cultural warriors of the "Gear Playhouse" troupe performed revolutionary cultural programs at the meeting, including the moving scene of being received by Chairman Mao one year ago, titled "Chairman Mao - The Reddest Red Sun in Our Hearts," and other programs praising Chairman Mao. The venue was filled with a hot and joyful revolutionary atmosphere. During the performance, the actors said with sincere feelings: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your reception of us is a great support and encouragement to the revolutionary people of Japan. In the future, no matter what difficulties we encounter, we will definitely advance in the direction you pointed out. We will certainly go from victory to victory. We believe that a brand-new Japan will definitely appear in the East of the world!" At this moment, the entire venue was in an uproar, and people shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years! Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!"

Representatives from the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Leftist faction) and workers, youth, and women also spoke at the meeting. Kokuya Shoichiro, who recently returned to Japan after participating in the visit to China by the Joint Delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) and the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, gave a report on his visit to China, which was warmly welcomed.

The celebration also screened a documentary film of Chairman Mao receiving the "Gear Playhouse" troupe.

The celebration ended successfully with the songs "Count on the Helmsman in the Vast Ocean" and "The Internationale."

    这天中午，“齿轮座”剧团的团员们胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，兴高采烈地来到毛主席像前。这时，场内响起了庄严的《东方红》乐曲。“齿轮座”的团员们回忆起一年前的今天，毛主席和林彪副主席在人民大会堂接见他们时的最幸福的时刻和情景。他们情不自禁地长时间地热烈鼓掌。

    会场正面还悬挂着毛主席六年前书赠日本工人朋友们的重要题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”
    “齿轮座”访华代表团团长藤川夏子在会上讲话。她说，毛主席接见我们，是对日本人民的无比巨大的鼓舞。代表团回到日本以后，为了向日本人民报告毛主席接见“齿轮座”访华代表团的大喜讯，我们把当时的情景排演成节目，由毛泽东思想宣传队到日本各地演出。很多观众感动得流下了热泪。他们认识到毛主席对日本人民的关怀，七亿中国人民对日本人民的支援，从而加强了日本人民的斗争决心。
    藤川强调说，我们一定要把毛主席书赠日本工人朋友们的伟大题词铭刻在心上，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持为革命服务的文艺路线，在革命的大道上阔步前进。
    藤川谴责了美日反动派和日共宫本修正主义集团的反共、反华、反人民的阴谋，并且强调指出，日本人民必须揭露和彻底粉碎帝修反的反动政策，坚决捍卫世界革命的堡垒——中国。
    “齿轮座”剧团的文艺战士在会上怀着革命激情，演出了一年前受到毛主席接见时的激动人心的场面的文艺节目《毛主席——我们心中最红最红的红太阳》以及其他歌颂毛主席的革命文艺节目。场内充满着热烈的、欢腾的革命气氛。在演出过程中，演员们以真挚的感情说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您接见我们，是对日本革命人民的巨大支援和巨大鼓舞。今后我们不管遇到怎样的困难，我们一定按照您指出的方向前进，我们必将从胜利走向胜利。我们相信，一个崭新的日本，一定会出现在世界的东方！”这时，全场沸腾，人们高呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”
    日共山口县委员会（左派）代表以及工人、青年、妇女代表也分别在会上讲了话。参加日中友好协会（正统）、日中文化交流协会联合代表团访问中国最近回到日本的古谷庄一郎，在会上作了访华报告，受到热烈欢迎。
