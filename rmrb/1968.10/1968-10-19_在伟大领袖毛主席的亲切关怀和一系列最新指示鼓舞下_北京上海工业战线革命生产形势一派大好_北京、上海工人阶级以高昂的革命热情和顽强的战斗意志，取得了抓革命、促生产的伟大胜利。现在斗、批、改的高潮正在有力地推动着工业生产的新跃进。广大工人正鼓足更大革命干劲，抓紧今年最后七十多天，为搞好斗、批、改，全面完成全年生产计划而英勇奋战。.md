Under the warm care and the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, the industrial production situation in Beijing and Shanghai is excellent. The working class in Beijing and Shanghai, with high revolutionary enthusiasm and tenacious fighting spirit, has achieved great victories in the struggle for revolution and production. Currently, the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation is powerfully promoting a new leap in industrial production. The broad masses of workers are redoubling their revolutionary efforts, seizing the remaining more than seventy days of this year, and bravely fighting to complete the year's production plan while thoroughly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 18th, under the warm care and the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, and in the midst of the great tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the working class in the capital, with high revolutionary enthusiasm and tenacious fighting spirit, has achieved new victories in the struggle for revolution and production in September. Now, all revolutionary workers in the city are riding the great momentum of Chairman Mao and his close comrade Vice Chairman Lin's warm reception of worker representatives from all over the country, redoubling their revolutionary efforts, seizing the remaining more than seventy days of this year, and launching a magnificent mass movement of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping to thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation and fully complete the year's production plan.

"Chairman Mao is backing us up, and we must make Chairman Mao proud!" This is the ironclad pledge of the working class in the city. They are determined to respond to the great concern and sincere expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao for the working class with actual actions. They are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, "fully playing the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," continuing to send batches of industrial workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, marching into schools and various domains of the superstructure to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation there; at the same time, in industrial and mining enterprises, they have launched a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation and the struggle for revolution and production, making the industrial front present a vibrant and excellent situation. In September, the city's industrial production increased significantly, with the total output value increasing by 10.7% compared to August. The production of seven industrial systems, including metallurgy, machinery, instruments, textiles, chemicals, light industry, and secondary light industry, all exceeded the highest monthly levels in history. Some enterprises' output value in September exceeded that of the same period in 1966 by one to two times; the production of major products such as coal, steel, pig iron, fertilizers, machine tools, electric motors, transformers, automobiles, sewing machines, and watches all saw significant increases.

The great news of Chairman Mao's warm reception of the capital's worker representatives and Chairman Mao's great battle cry of "the working class must lead everything" greatly inspired the working class fighting in Chairman Mao's vicinity. Revolutionary workers throughout the city are putting their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao into practice by closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and thoroughly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation and the struggle for revolution and production. The Beijing Knitting Factory has achieved great results in the struggle for revolution and production, and by the 14th, the entire factory had completed the year's production plan two months ahead of schedule. The workers of the Beijing Mining Bureau, with a strong sense of ownership, universally organized worker investigation and research teams, tackled key issues, solved difficult problems, promoted the deep development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, fully mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of revolutionary workers, and the entire mine completed the September coal production plan five days ahead of schedule.

The revolutionary committees of various levels in the capital's industrial and mining enterprises, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao that "the working class is the leading class," have fully played the leading role of the working class in the high tide of the struggle for revolution and production, resolutely mobilized the masses, respected the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses, and greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses. Revolutionary workers are full of vigor and fighting spirit, saying: "We have a heart loyal to Chairman Mao, and we will trample any great difficulty underfoot." In this way, many "old, big, and difficult" problems that were originally thought to be unsolvable have been easily resolved. When the Chemical Bureau initially arranged the production plan, only a few people were calculating in the room, and some had a sense of difficulty, lacking confidence in completing the production tasks. However, after they revealed the bottom line to the masses, revolutionary workers immediately took action, vying to take on heavy responsibilities, and the production immediately took on a new look. The entire bureau's production level in September exceeded the highest monthly production level in history, and they have the confidence to greatly exceed the year's production plan. The revolutionary committee of the Beijing Second Woolen Mill has continuously overcome the conservative thoughts of some leading members, launched mass movements, and rapidly improved production levels, creating new high records of monthly production exceeding the highest levels since the factory's establishment in July, August, and September. The revolutionary workers of the Capital Steel Company have learned from and caught up with advanced units, and after achieving new results in the struggle for revolution and production in September, they have not relaxed their efforts, and the production in the first ten days of October has increased significantly compared to September.

In the high tide of the struggle for revolution and production, the revolutionary workers of the capital's industrial and mining enterprises not only showed high revolutionary enthusiasm but also demonstrated high wisdom, combining hard work with ingenuity. In the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, they used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize the "expert management" and "technology first" reactionary revisionist lines promoted by Liu Shaoqi, kicked out the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," broke the foreign frameworks, and launched a mass technical innovation and technological revolution, producing a large number of new technologies, new techniques, and new products. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Third Rolling Mill, with the help of relevant research and design departments, after transforming an ordinary four-roll mill into an advanced eight-roll cold-rolled strip steel machine, recently transformed a four-roll mill into a sixteen-roll mill capable of producing extremely thin strip steel, making new achievements in catching up with the world's advanced scientific and technological level. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Instrument Factory combined hard work with ingenuity, realizing more than eighty innovation projects in September, and the total output value increased by more than three times compared to August.

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade Vice Chairman Lin received worker representatives from all over the country on October 5, keeping the revolutionary workers of the capital in a state of immense excitement and happiness. Revolutionary workers throughout the city are turning Chairman Mao's warm care into a great driving force, enthusiastically responding to the call of the entire delegation of the capital's worker representatives to the National Day celebration to the revolutionary workers of the city's industrial, transportation, urban construction, and financial and commercial fronts to struggle for revolution and production.

Currently, the industrial front is in an excellent situation. The working class of the capital, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, deeply understands that the achievements made so far are only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li, and the tasks facing the fourth quarter are still arduous and glorious. They must raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, oppose conservative thoughts, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and thorough revolution, and in the great historical task of leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and in the struggle for revolution and production, create greater achievements to respond to the great concern of the great leader Chairman Mao and make new contributions to the people on the road to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on the 18th, under the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the great tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation launched by the working class in Shanghai is powerfully promoting a new leap in Shanghai's industrial production. Since entering the fourth quarter, the working class in Shanghai, based on the outstanding achievements in the struggle for revolution and production in the first three quarters of this year, has continued to advance and is bravely fighting to make greater contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the dispatch of 700 outstanding representatives of the Shanghai working class to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration, and the worker representatives received the inspection and reception of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, which is the greatest care and encouragement for the hundred thousand industrial workers in Shanghai. Vice Chairman Lin's important speech on National Day and the National Day editorial "Advancing Bravely on the Road to Victory" by the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily conveyed the great command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. To closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and establish new merits in the struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee immediately held an expanded meeting to make arrangements. Immediately after that, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front held a "Redouble Efforts, Strive for the Front, Launch a New High Tide of Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation" rally. At the meeting, 25 units, including the No. 17 Cotton Mill, Shanghai Valve Factory No. 1, and Shanghai Port Bureau No. 7 Loading and Unloading Area, issued a call to the entire city's industrial and transportation front to fully implement Chairman Mao's instructions, fight for three months to exceed the annual national plan, and achieve new victories in the struggle for revolution and production to report to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Their call was enthusiastically responded to by thousands of factories on both banks of the Huangpu River. The industrial front of Shanghai immediately became hot and surging, and the tide of progress rolled on. Metallurgy and chemical industry factories launched a wave of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping, the battle drums of the textile industry's struggle in the fourth quarter were sounded, and the revolutionary and production high tide of the light industry front surged forward.

Victorious news came frequently. The city's total industrial output value in the second quarter increased significantly compared to the first quarter, and the third quarter increased by more than 10% compared to the second quarter. Especially in September, the city's total industrial output value exceeded the highest level in history. The total output value of the instrument and telecommunications system in August had already reached the highest level in history, and in September, it increased by 26% compared to August. The total output value of the chemical industry in September exceeded the highest monthly level in history by 3.7%, and 15 factories' output value in the first nine months of this year exceeded the total output value of 1966. The output of 47 major products in the light industry in September reached the highest level in history, and 78 factories' output value in the first nine months had already exceeded the total output value of 1966. Since October, many factories and industries have achieved even greater successes: the total output value of many factories in the chemical and metallurgical systems in the first ten days of October has increased compared to September, and many factories in the metallurgical industry have seen new leaps in production, quality, specifications, and varieties. The Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant has refreshed all historical high records for all products in the first three quarters of this year, and in the first ten days of October, the production of steel and steel products has exceeded the plan, with steel production increasing by 5.1% compared to the first ten days of September, and steel product production increasing by 27.2% compared to the first ten days of September. The total output value of the Shanghai Radio Factory from January to September this year has already exceeded the total output value of 1966, and upon entering October, the entire factory launched a broader and deeper mass movement of the struggle for revolution and production, and the total output value in the first ten days of October increased by 43% compared to the first ten days of September, creating the highest level in the same period in history.

In the "struggle for revolution, promote production" comparison, learning, catching up, and helping movement, the working class in Shanghai, following Chairman Mao's great teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," first focuses on the revolution. They fiercely grasp class struggle, revolutionary criticism, the consolidation and construction of revolutionary committees, and party rectification and construction work, using revolution to command everything and using revolution to promote everything. The revolutionary committees and proletarian revolutionary cadres at various levels on the industrial and transportation front also held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, placing the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, and fiercely promoting the thought revolution of the broad masses of workers. The revolution promoted production. Many factory revolutionary workers used the sky-high enthusiasm aroused in the Cultural Revolution and launched a wave of technical innovation and technological revolution, promoting the rapid development of production.

The working class in Shanghai resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call for "the working class must lead everything," dispatching tens of thousands of outstanding industrial workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and with the cooperation and support of the People's Liberation Army, they marched into primary and secondary schools and all places where intellectuals gather, stepping onto the political stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various domains of the superstructure. After more than two months of revolutionary practice, they have already created great achievements. At the same time, they took on the task of re-educating the cadres and office staff in their own factories, taking the initiative, forming investigation teams and propaganda teams, entering the offices, uniting and educating the intellectuals in those departments, leading and promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation in those departments.

Starting from the overall situation, bravely taking on heavy responsibilities, and carrying forward the spirit of communist cooperation, this is a distinctive feature of the working class in Shanghai in the struggle for revolution and production in the fourth quarter. Many factories let convenience go to others and kept the difficulties for themselves, actively helping brother factories solve problems, and when one side had difficulties, everyone came to help, developing the mass movement of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping to a new stage.

In the situation of surging progress and leaping forward like dragons and tigers, the new and old revolutionary cadres at various levels of the revolutionary committees on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, went deep into the front lines, stood at the forefront of the struggle, studied, labored, and fought with the worker masses, and were determined to push all work forward comprehensively and solidly.

A magnificent battle.

    在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和一系列最新指示鼓舞下
    北京上海工业战线革命生产形势一派大好
    北京、上海工人阶级以高昂的革命热情和顽强的战斗意志，取得了抓革命、促生产的伟大胜利。现在斗、批、改的高潮正在有力地推动着工业生产的新跃进。广大工人正鼓足更大革命干劲，抓紧今年最后七十多天，为搞好斗、批、改，全面完成全年生产计划而英勇奋战。
    据新华社十八日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席亲切关怀和一系列最新指示的巨大鼓舞下，在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，首都工人阶级以高昂的革命热情和顽强的战斗意志，取得了九月份抓革命、促生产的新胜利。现在，全市广大革命职工正乘伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲切接见全国各地工人代表的浩荡东风，大鼓革命干劲，抓紧今年最后的七十多天，为搞好斗、批、改，全面完成全年的生产计划，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的比、学、赶、帮运动。
    “毛主席给我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气！”这是全市工人阶级发出的钢铁誓言。他们决心以实际行动回答伟大领袖毛主席对工人阶级的巨大关怀和殷切期望。他们步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，“充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”，继续派出大批产业工人组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，开进学校和上层建筑各个领域，领导那里的斗、批、改；同时，在工矿企业掀起了斗、批、改和抓革命、促生产的新高潮，使工业战线呈现出一派朝气勃勃的大好形势。九月份全市的工业生产大幅度上升，总产值又比八月份增长百分之十点七，冶金、机械、仪表、纺织、化工、一轻和二轻七个工业系统的生产，都超过了历史上的最高月水平。有的企业九月份产值超过一九六六年同期一倍到二倍；煤炭、钢、生铁、化肥、机床、电动机、变压器、汽车、缝纫机、手表等主要产品的产量，都有大幅度增长。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲切接见首都工人代表的特大喜讯，和毛主席发出“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大战斗号令，极大地鼓舞了战斗在毛主席身边的首都工人阶级。广大革命职工把无限忠于毛主席的红心，落实在紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真搞好斗、批、改和抓革命、促生产的实际行动上。北京针织总厂取得抓革命、促生产的伟大成果，到十四日，全厂提前两个多月完成了全年生产计划。北京矿务局的工人群众以高度的主人翁责任感，普遍组织了工人调查研究小组，抓关键，解决疑难问题，推动了斗、批、改的深入发展，充分调动了广大革命职工的革命积极性，全矿提前五天完成了九月份的原煤生产计划。
    首都工矿企业各级革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席“工人阶级是领导阶级”的教导，在抓革命、促生产的高潮中，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，坚定不移地放手发动群众，尊重群众的革命首创精神，极大地调动了群众的积极性。广大革命职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，他们说：“我们有一颗忠于毛主席的红心，天大的困难，也要把它踩在脚下。”这样，就使很多原来认为解决不了的“老、大、难”问题迎刃而解。化工局在开始安排生产计划时，只是少数人关在屋子里算账，有的人有畏难情绪，对完成生产任务缺乏信心，但是当他们向群众交了底以后，广大革命职工立即行动起来纷纷争挑重担，生产上立即出现了新的面貌，全局九月份的生产水平，超过了历史上的最高月产水平，并且有信心大大超过全年的生产计划。北京第二毛纺厂革命委员会不断克服个别领导成员的右倾保守思想，大搞群众运动，使生产水平迅速上升，七、八、九月份创造了月月突破建厂以来月产量最高纪录的新水平。首都钢铁公司广大革命职工学先进，赶先进，在取得九月份抓革命、促生产新成绩以后，毫不松劲，十月上旬的生产又比九月份有较大幅度的提高。
    首都工矿企业的广大革命职工在抓革命、促生产的高潮中，不仅发扬了高昂的革命热情，而且也表现了高度的智慧，把实干和巧干结合起来。他们在斗、批、改的高潮中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等反革命修正主义路线，踢开资产阶级反动技术“权威”，大破洋框框，正在兴起一个群众性的技术革新和技术革命高潮，出现了大量的新工艺、新技术、新产品。北京第三轧钢厂广大革命职工，在有关科研、设计部门的帮助下，在把一台普通四辊轧机改装成具有先进水平的八辊冷轧带钢机之后，最近又把一台四辊轧机改装成能生产极薄带钢的十六辊轧机，在赶超世界科学技术先进水平方面做出了新成绩。北京仪器厂广大革命职工实干加巧干，九月份实现革新项目八十多项，总产值比八月份提高三倍多。
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席十月五日接见全国各地工人代表，使首都工人阶级一直浸沉在无比的激动和幸福之中。全市广大革命职工正在把毛主席的亲切关怀，化为巨大的动力，热烈响应首都工人国庆观礼代表团全体代表向全市工交、城建、财贸战线革命职工发出的抓革命、促生产的倡议书。
    当前，工业战线是一片大好形势。用毛泽东思想武装起来的首都工人阶级深刻地认识到，过去取得的成就，只是万里长征走完了第一步，第四季度面临的任务，仍然是艰巨而又光荣的，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，反对右倾保守思想，发扬不断革命、彻底革命精神，在领导斗、批、改的伟大历史任务中，在抓革命、促生产的战斗中，创造更大的成绩，回答伟大领袖毛主席的巨大关怀，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的征途上为人民再立新功。
    据新华社上海十八日电　在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，上海工人阶级掀起的气势磅礴的斗、批、改高潮，正在有力地推动着上海工业生产的新跃进。进入第四季度以来，上海工人阶级在今年前三个季度抓革命促生产取得出色成绩的基础上，乘胜前进，正为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利做出更大贡献而英勇奋战。
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准上海工人阶级派出七百名优秀代表到北京参加国庆观礼，以及工人代表受到毛主席和林副主席的检阅和接见，这是对上海百万产业工人的最大关怀和最大鼓舞。林副主席在国庆节的重要讲话以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的国庆社论《在胜利的大道上奋勇前进》，传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的伟大号令。为了紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中建立新的功勋，上海市革命委员会立即召开扩大会议，作了研究部署。紧接着，上海工交战线广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众举行了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，掀起斗、批、改新高潮誓师大会”。会上，国棉十七厂、上海阀门一厂、上海港务局第七装卸区等二十五个单位，向全市工交战线发出了全面落实毛主席指示，奋战三个月超额完成全年国家计划，夺取抓革命促生产的新胜利，向最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席汇报的倡议书。他们的倡议得到了浦江两岸几千个工厂的热烈响应。上海工业战线顿时热气腾腾，跃进浪潮滚滚而来。冶金、化学工业各工厂掀起了比学赶帮热潮，纺织工业奋战第四季度的战鼓擂响了，轻工业战线革命和生产的高潮也奔腾向前。
    胜利的捷报频频传来。全市工业总产值第二季度比第一季度大幅度增长，第三季度又比第二季度增长百分之十以上。特别是九月份，全市工业总产值超过了历史最高水平。仪表电讯系统八月份生产已达到历史最高水平，九月份总产值又比八月份提高百分之二十六。化学工业九月份的总产值超过历史最高月度的百分之三点七，有十五个工厂今年前九个月的产值超过了一九六六年全年总产值。轻工业四十七种主要产品九月份产量达到历史最高水平，七十八个工厂前九个月的产值已超过一九六六年全年的总产值。十月份以来，许多工厂和行业又取得了更大的成就：化工、冶金等系统不少工厂十月上旬的总产值都比九月份又有增长，冶金工业的不少工厂在产量、质量、规格、品种等方面，都出现了新的跃进气象。上钢三厂今年前三个季度所有产品都全面刷新了历史最高纪录，十月上旬钢和钢材的产量又超额完成计划，钢产量比九月上旬增加百分之五点一，钢材产量比九月上旬猛增百分之二十七点二。上海无线电一厂今年一到九月份的总产值已超过一九六六年全年的总产值，一进入十月份，全厂又掀起了更广泛深入的抓革命促生产的群众运动，十月上旬的总产值比九月上旬增长百分之四十三，创造了历史上同期的最高水平。
    在“抓革命，促生产”的比学赶帮运动中，上海工人阶级遵照毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，首先抓好革命。他们狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓革命大批判，狠抓革命委员会的巩固和建设，狠抓整党、建党工作，以革命统帅一切，以革命带动一切。工交战线的各级革委会和无产阶级革命派，还大办毛泽东思想学习班，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，狠抓广大职工的思想革命化。革命推动了生产。许多工厂的革命职工把在文化大革命中激发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上，掀起了大搞技术革新和技术革命的热潮，推动了生产的突飞猛进。
    上海工人阶级坚决响应毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大号召，抽调了成千成万的优秀产业工人组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在人民解放军指战员的配合和支持下，浩浩荡荡地开进大、中、小学和一切知识分子成堆的地方，登上了上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台。经过两个多月的革命实践，他们已经创造出很大的功绩。与此同时，他们又担负起对自己工厂里的干部和科室人员进行再教育的任务，以主人翁的姿态，组成了调查组、宣传队等，进入科室，团结和教育那些部门的知识分子，领导和促进那些部门的斗、批、改。
    从全局出发，勇挑重担，发扬共产主义大协作的风格，这是上海工人阶级在第四季度抓革命促生产斗争中的鲜明特色。许多厂把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己，主动帮助兄弟厂解决问题，一方有困难，大家来帮助，使群众性的比学赶帮运动发展到了一个新的阶段。
    在一派你追我赶、龙腾虎跃的跃进形势下，上海工交战线各级革命委员会的新老革命干部遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，深入第一线，站在斗争的最前列，同工人群众同学习、同劳动、同战斗，决心扎扎实实地把各项工作全面地推向前进。
    一场气壮山河的战斗
