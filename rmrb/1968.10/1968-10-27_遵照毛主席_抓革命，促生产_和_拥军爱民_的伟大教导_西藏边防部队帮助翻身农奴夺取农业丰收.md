People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet's border regions have, in accordance with the great instructions of Chairman Mao on "grasping the revolution and promoting production" and "supporting the army and loving the people," energetically launched activities to assist with the autumn harvest, helping a million liberated serfs achieve their tenth bumper harvest.

At present, from the Lhasa Valley to the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, across the vast Tibetan plateau stretching over ten thousand miles, wheat and barley are thick and full, turning golden yellow, presenting a scene of bumper harvest everywhere. To ensure that the Tibetan revolutionary masses achieve a bumper harvest, the leadership of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has issued several directives to the troops to assist with the autumn harvest. Troops stationed in Lhasa, Chamdo, Linzhi, Shannan, and Shigatse have responded promptly. Soldiers have raised red flags, carried portraits of Chairman Mao, beaten drums, and enthusiastically rushed to the front lines of the autumn harvest. Soldiers from a certain unit, who have made new contributions in defending the border and in the "three supports and two military" work, have shown concern for the people, protected their interests, and blended in with the people of all ethnic groups. During the harvest, they cut the wheat stalks low and cleanly, picking up every fallen ear of wheat, ensuring that not a single grain is lost. Soldiers from a certain unit stationed in the Shannan region helped the people overcome the threat of floods, saving over five thousand acres of ripe barley and the lives and property of several villages. The troops also organized medical teams to go into the fields and treat the people.

Soldiers assisting with the autumn harvest and agricultural support teams have also energetically helped the people set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carrying out the "three loyalties" activities of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many soldiers held criticism meetings with the people in the fields, further exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tibet who attempted to restore the feudal serf system, greatly raising the political awareness of the broad masses.

The troops also regard assisting with the autumn harvest as a great opportunity to learn from the broad masses of liberated serfs. Through visiting the poor and asking about their hardships, the soldiers humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants, further raising their class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle, promoting the revolutionization of their thinking.

    西藏边防部队帮助翻身农奴夺取农业丰收
    新华社拉萨二十五日电  人民解放军驻西藏边防部队广大指战员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“拥军爱民”的伟大教导，大力开展助民秋收活动，帮助百万翻身农奴夺取第十个丰收年。
    目前，从拉萨河谷到雅鲁藏布江畔的万里西藏高原上，小麦、青稞秆粗穗大，一片金黄，到处呈现出一片丰收景象。为了帮助藏族革命群众确保丰产丰收，人民解放军西藏军区领导机关先后几次向部队发出了助民秋收的指示。驻拉萨、昌都、林芝、山南、日喀则等地部队，闻风而动。指战员们高擎红旗，抬着伟大领袖毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，积极奔赴秋收第一线。曾在保卫边疆和“三支”、“两军”工作中为人民立了新功的某部指战员，处处关心群众，维护群众利益，和各族人民群众打成一片。在秋收中，他们割的麦茬低，收得干净，把掉在地上的麦穗都一一捡起来，做到了颗粒还家。驻山南地区某部队指战员，帮助群众战胜洪水的侵袭，使五千多亩黄熟的青稞和当地几个村庄人民的生命财产没有受到损失。各部队还组织了大批的医疗队（组），深入田间为群众治病。
    助民秋收的指战员和支农的毛泽东思想宣传队，还大力帮助群众举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。许多指战员在田边地头和群众一起举行批判会，进一步揭发和批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西藏的代理人妄图复辟封建农奴制度的滔天罪行，大大提高了广大群众的政治觉悟。
    各部队还把助民秋收看作是向广大翻身农奴学习的大好机会。指战员们通过访贫问苦，虚心向贫下中农学习，进一步提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了思想革命化。
