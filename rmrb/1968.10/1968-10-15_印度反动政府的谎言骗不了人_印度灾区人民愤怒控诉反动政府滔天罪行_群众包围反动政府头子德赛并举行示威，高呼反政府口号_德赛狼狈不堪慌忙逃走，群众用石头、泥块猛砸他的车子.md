The lies of the Indian reactionary government cannot deceive the people. The people of the disaster-stricken areas in India are angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of the reactionary government. The masses surrounded the head of the reactionary government, Desai, and held a demonstration, shouting anti-government slogans. Desai fled in disarray, and the masses pelted his car with stones and clods of earth.

New Delhi, October 11th: Recent severe floods have occurred in the northeastern states of West Bengal, Assam, and Bihar in India.

The suffering people of the disaster-stricken areas, filled with indignation, are denouncing the heinous crimes of the Indian reactionary government, which oppresses the people and does not care about their lives.

On the 10th, Indian Deputy Prime Minister Desai, feigning concern for the victims, boarded a helicopter to "inspect" the disaster area. This trick cannot deceive the increasingly awakened Indian people. When he arrived in Jalpaiguri, a town in northern West Bengal, the angry masses immediately surrounded the military jeep he was riding in, held a demonstration, and shouted slogans against the central and state governments. The masses questioned him, asking why the officials ran away when the flood came, and why the government did not come to rescue them even after six days had passed.

Desai was at a loss for words and could not answer.

Then, the masses demanded that Desai get out of the jeep and walk in the muddy water like them.

Desai, this old pro-American politician, immediately revealed his true colors, shouting maliciously, "Do you want to kill me? What good will it do for you if I walk in the muddy water?" He immediately fled in the car. The enraged masses pelted his car with stones and clods of earth.

According to initial estimates by Indian newspapers on the 9th, the population of the affected areas is over five million, and tens of thousands of people have been surrounded by the floodwaters.

In the three counties of northern West Bengal, including Darjeeling, 25,000 to 30,000 people went missing in this flood. The entire town of Jalpaiguri was submerged in water up to twelve feet deep for twenty-four hours. Afterwards, the town was littered with dead cows, totaling over fifty thousand. The flood also destroyed many roads, bridges, and power lines.

The most severely affected counties of Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, and Siliguri were the areas where the wave of armed peasant struggles in India surged last year. The suffering Indian peasants will certainly launch larger-scale armed struggles and deal a heavier blow to the Indian reactionaries.

    新华社十一日讯　新德里消息：印度东北部西孟加拉邦、阿萨姆邦、比哈尔邦最近发生严重水灾。
    苦难深重的灾区人民，怀着满腔怒火，控诉印度反动政府残害人民、不顾人民死活的滔天罪行。
    印度副总理德赛十日装出一副“关心灾民”的虚伪姿态，坐上直升飞机到灾区“视察”。这套鬼把戏骗不了日益觉醒的印度人民。当他到达西孟加拉邦北部贾尔派古里镇的时候，愤怒的群众立即把他乘坐的军用吉普车包围起来，举行示威，高呼反对中央政府和邦政府的口号。群众质问他，为什么那些当官的看到大水来时一溜了事，大水把当地人民的房子财物冲得一干二净，六天已经过去了，政府根本不来救济？德赛被问得瞠目结舌，无法回答。
    接着，群众要德赛滚出吉普车，象他们一样在泥水里走一走。
    德赛这个老牌亲美政客当场现出原形，恶狠狠地叫嚷：“你们要杀我吗？我在泥水里走，你们得到什么好处？”马上开车溜跑。被激怒了的群众用石头和泥块猛砸他的车子。
    据印度报纸九日初步估计，受灾地区人口有五百多万，被洪水围困的已有几十万人。
    仅西孟加拉邦北部大吉岭等三个县，在这场水灾中失踪了两万五千到三万人。整个贾尔派古里镇一度被深达十二英尺的大水淹没了二十四小时。事后，镇上到处躺着淹死了的牛，一共有五万多头。洪水还冲断了许多道路、桥梁、电线。
    灾情最重的贾尔派古里、大吉岭、西里古里等县，是去年印度农民武装斗争浪潮高涨的地区。苦难的印度农民一定会开展更大规模的武装斗争，给印度反动派以更沉重的打击。
