Millions of people across the nation enthusiastically acclaim Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's reception of revolutionary committee members and worker representatives from various regions

Following Chairman Mao's guidance that the working class must lead everything, resolutely complete the great historical mission of class struggle, criticism, and reform in the superstructure

Revolutionary committee members and workers from various regions have expressed their determination to turn Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's reception into a great political force. They vowed to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify thoughts, policies, steps, and actions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

New China News Agency, October 6th: As the working class takes the stage in the superstructure's various fields for class struggle, criticism, and reform, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters a new stage of revolutionary high tide. The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin warmly received revolutionary committee members from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and worker representatives in Beijing to celebrate National Day. This has greatly inspired the revolutionary committees and workers across the nation, becoming a powerful driving force for the revolutionary masses across the nation to advance victoriously. Revolutionary committee members and workers from various regions expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, adhere to Chairman Mao's great guidance that the working class must lead everything, earnestly carry out class struggle, criticism, and reform, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin approved the invitation of worker representatives from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to Beijing to celebrate National Day and warmly received them. This is the greatest care and encouragement for the working class across the nation. Wherever the good news spread, there were shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal youth! Ten thousand years!" Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chengdu, and other cities with concentrated working-class populations held various celebrations. Changsha, Shijiazhuang, Nanjing, Jinan, Nanning, Lanzhou, Urumqi, and many other places, as well as the steel city of Anshan, held celebrations with thousands to tens of thousands of participants.

Workers from Beijing Knitting Factory, Beijing Instrument Factory, Second Rolling Mill, and other enterprises braved the rain at night to express their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao at Zhongnanhai. At Wuhan Steel Company, Chongqing Steel Company, First Automobile Works in Changchun, Guangzhou Paper Mill, and other enterprises where Chairman Mao has inspected, revolutionary workers gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait after hearing the good news, swearing to further launch a high tide of class struggle, criticism, and reform, promote revolution and production, and repay Chairman Mao's care with actual actions. In the hero city of Nanchang, workers joyfully paraded in the streets. Some workers wrote poems expressing their deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao: "Sunflowers bloom towards the sun, rivers rush into the sea, workers' hearts turn to the red sun, the red flower of loyalty blooms for ten thousand generations." Workers building the Yangtze River Bridge in Nanjing vowed to keep the world in mind while standing by the Yangtze River, achieve greater victories in revolution and construction, and strike hard at imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries to bring glory to Chairman Mao. Many Tibetan revolutionary workers in Lhasa excitedly said, "The great leader Chairman Mao saved us slaves from the sea of suffering, nurtured us into the first generation of workers in Tibet, and became the leading class of Tibet's revolution and construction. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life!"

Revolutionary committee members and revolutionary workers from various regions, while celebrating Chairman Mao's warm reception, once again studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work must be fully exerted." "The proletariat must exercise dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the superstructure, including various cultural fields." Many workers excitedly said that the working class taking the stage in the superstructure's class struggle, criticism, and reform is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, a great innovation in the history of proletarian revolution, and a great event of the 1960s. We workers must turn Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's reception into a great political force, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify thoughts, policies, steps, and actions to complete the great historical mission of class struggle, criticism, and reform in the superstructure assigned by Chairman Mao.

The good news reached the "Rally to Launch a New High Tide of Class Struggle, Criticism, and Reform with Great Enthusiasm and Strive to Surpass" held in Shanghai. Workers and revolutionary cadres present were extremely excited. The responsible comrades of the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters said: Chairman Mao waves his hand, and we workers advance bravely, taking the stage in the superstructure's various fields for class struggle, criticism, and reform. We must unite with the broad revolutionary masses, launch a new high tide of class struggle, criticism, and reform, carry out party rectification and construction work, better strengthen party leadership, and consolidate proletarian dictatorship. The first team of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams organized by the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, with industrial workers as the main body and participation from PLA soldiers, entered Shanxi University after organizing revolutionary teachers, students, staff, and their families to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve revolutionary great unity between the two previously opposing mass organizations. Team members of the propaganda team were excited to hear the good news of Chairman Mao receiving worker representatives, saying, "Chairman Mao trusts and relies on the working class the most. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and must carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end." All members of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entering Qinghai Normal University held an all-night discussion meeting to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao and declare their determination. They said, "We must fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, unite all forces that can be united, strike hard at a handful of class enemies, and carry out class struggle, criticism, and reform in schools to the end."

Many factory workers expressed that while sending outstanding workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter the superstructure's various fields, they must also carry out class struggle, criticism, and reform better in their own units. Workers from Guangzhou Heavy Machinery Factory expressed at a symposium held by the factory revolutionary committee that they must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class, carry out thorough reforms on all superstructures that do not fit the socialist economic base, and block the channels for the production of revisionism. The revolutionary committee and workers of Wuhan Chemical Factory held meetings on the evenings of the 5th and 6th, vowing to carry out the "Three Loyalties" activity of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line more broadly and deeply, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and earnestly carry out class struggle, criticism, and reform.

The great leader Chairman Mao taught: "The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." Revolutionary workers across the nation, while enthusiastically acclaiming the great news of Chairman Mao receiving worker representatives, expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the great class struggle, criticism, and reform, and temper themselves into proletarian revolutionary fighters who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Various workshops and teams in Lanzhou Longfeng Machinery Factory held symposiums, with workers comparing themselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, finding gaps collectively and individually, and with brother units, and formulating measures to achieve ideological revolutionization and carry out class struggle, criticism, and reform. Workers from Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory said, "To fight the battle of class struggle, criticism, and reform, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, criticize and repudiate revisionism, continuously improve political awareness, and achieve new victories in both revolution and production."

Revolutionary committee members, while acclaiming Chairman Mao's reception, vowed to quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "A large number of cadres should go down to labor, which is a good opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, they should all do so. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." The revolutionary committee of Shijiazhuang Coal Mining Machinery Factory decided to send more cadres to the production frontline based on the previous streamlining of personnel, so that they can reform their worldview in labor and always maintain the revolutionary youthfulness of the proletariat.

Revolutionary workers across the nation, inspired by the great news of Chairman Mao receiving worker representatives, further launched a new high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production. Miners from Kaiping Coal Mine in Hebei Province increased their enthusiasm after hearing the good news, and the coal production of the first and second shifts on the 6th increased by more than 900 tons compared to the 5th. Railway workers at Zhengzhou North Station were full of fighting spirit, and the work volume on the 6th was significantly higher than the average daily work volume in September. The Taiyuan Railway Bureau has been immersed in excitement and happiness since sending representatives to Beijing to celebrate National Day. In September, they completed their transportation production tasks victoriously, and the transportation volume in the first five days of October was more than 6% higher than the same period in September. The good news of Chairman Mao receiving worker representatives came, and revolutionary workers were even more enthusiastic and energetic. Workers from Yinchuan Rubber Factory, who created the highest daily production record in the factory's history on the eve of National Day, were greatly inspired by the good news and decided to increase the daily production plan for October by more than 9%. Revolutionary workers across the nation all expressed their determination to create even more outstanding achievements to repay the great leader Chairman Mao's warm care.
