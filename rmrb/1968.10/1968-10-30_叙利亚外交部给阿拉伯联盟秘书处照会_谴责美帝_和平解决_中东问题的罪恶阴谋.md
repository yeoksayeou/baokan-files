Syria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Secretariat of the Arab League on the 26th, condemning the imperialist countries led by the United States for supporting Israel's aggression against Arab countries and their so-called "peaceful resolution" of the Middle East issue, which aims to coerce Arab countries into surrendering to the Israeli aggressors.

The note pointed out that the only solution to the Middle East issue is to reject the resolution on the Middle East issue passed by the United Nations Security Council in November last year under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, to end the activities of the United Nations "Special Envoy" Jarring in the Middle East, to support the Palestinian resistance movement, and to mobilize all Arab forces to defeat the Israeli aggressors and liberate the Arab lands occupied by Israel.

The note emphasized that holding "negotiations" with Israel "is to crown the imperialist Zionist aggression, is to achieve all the purposes that the aggressors and their imperialist supporters want to achieve, and is to make colonialist Zionism permanent."

The note said: "The Syrian Arab Republic reaffirms that such a surrendering solution will not restore the rights and dignity of the Arab people."

The note said that Syria has already rejected all the "resolutions" of the United Nations on the Middle East issue, especially the "resolution" of the United Nations Security Council in November last year, and has declared that Syria will not accept any text that attaches any conditions to the withdrawal of the Israeli aggressor forces.

    叙利亚外交部给阿拉伯联盟秘书处照会
    谴责美帝“和平解决”中东问题的罪恶阴谋
    新华社大马士革二十七日电　叙利亚外交部二十六日在给阿拉伯联盟秘书处的一个照会中，谴责以美国为首的帝国主义国家支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家，及其企图诱迫阿拉伯国家向以色列侵略者投降的所谓“和平解决”中东问题的罪恶阴谋。
    照会指出，中东问题的唯一解决办法是：拒绝联合国安全理事会去年十一月在美帝国主义操纵下通过的关于中东问题的“决议”，结束联合国“特使”雅林在中东的活动，支持巴勒斯坦抵抗运动，动员一切阿拉伯潜力击败以色列侵略者，解放被以色列占领的阿拉伯土地。
    照会强调说，同以色列举行“谈判”，“是给帝国主义的犹太复国主义的侵略举行加冕礼，是为了实现侵略者及其帝国主义支持者所要达到的一切目的，是为了使殖民主义的犹太复国主义永久存在”。
    照会说：“阿拉伯叙利亚共和国重申，这种投降的解决办法不会恢复阿拉伯人民的权利和尊严。”
    照会说，叙利亚已经拒绝联合国关于中东问题的一切“决议”，特别是去年十一月联合国安全理事会的“决议”，并且宣布叙利亚决不接受给撤出以色列侵略军加上任何条件的任何文本。
