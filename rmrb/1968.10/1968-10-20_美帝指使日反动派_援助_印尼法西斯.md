The U.S. imperialists, who are currently facing a severe financial crisis, are attempting to further bolster the struggling Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime in Indonesia. To this end, they have directed the Japanese reactionary government of Sato to provide more "active" assistance to the Suharto military clique.

According to reports, U. Alexis Johnson, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, met with Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku on the afternoon of the 14th and engaged in a one-and-a-half-hour private discussion. Johnson explained to Sato the U.S. plans for "assisting" the Indonesian fascist military regime in the next fiscal year and strongly "requested" that the Sato government play an "active role" in this regard.

It has been revealed that Sato, in a servile manner, expressed to his American masters that, in order to establish the "peace and stability" in Asia that the U.S. imperialists require, the Japanese reactionary government will "provide the necessary assistance" to the Indonesian fascist military regime.

    美帝指使日反动派“援助”印尼法西斯
    正在遭遇严重的财政危机的美帝国主义，为了进一步给困难重重的印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权打强心剂，指使日本佐藤反动政府更“积极地”向苏哈托军人集团提供“援助”。
    据报道，美国驻日本大使乌·阿历克西斯·约翰逊十四日下午，会见日本首相佐藤荣作，同他密谈了一个半小时。约翰逊向佐藤说明了美国对下一年度“援助”印尼法西斯军人政权的“想法”并强烈“要求”日本佐藤政府在这一方面“起积极作用”。
    据透露，佐藤奴颜婢膝地向美国主子表示：为了在亚洲建立美帝所需要的“和平与安定”，日本反动政府将向印尼法西斯军人政权“提供应有的协助”。
