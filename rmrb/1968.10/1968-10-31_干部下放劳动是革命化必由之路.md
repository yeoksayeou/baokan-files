Cadres Going Down to the Countryside for Labor is a Necessary Path for Revolutionization

Dàtōng Coal Mine Worker Jiǎng Màotíng

"Broad cadres going down to the countryside for labor, this is a good opportunity for cadres to re-learn, except for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. In-service cadres should also go down in batches." Chairman Mao's latest instruction is the greatest concern for all revolutionary cadres, pointing the direction for cadre revolutionization.

What attitude do we hold towards Chairman Mao's latest instruction? Is it to seriously implement it, or to passively respond, or even to pay lip service? This is the touchstone to distinguish true revolutionaries from false ones. Our broad revolutionary cadres enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, seriously study, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction. However, there are also some cadres who are not like this. They are calculating their own interests. They also say with their mouths, "Resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call," but in their hearts, they think differently. What "I have worked for more than ten years, even if there is no merit, there is still hardship"! What "If I knew I would be sent down, why did I become a cadre"! Those with such thoughts, are they really responding to Chairman Mao's great call?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office, but are seeking revolution. We must all have thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a moment separate ourselves from the masses." Some cadres have long lived in big buildings and offices, separated from labor and the masses. If this situation is not thoroughly changed, it is inevitable that they will become revisionists. Cadres going down to the countryside for labor, going to the fiery class struggle and the front line of production struggle to "experience storms and see the world," strengthen thought revolutionization, thoroughly reform their worldview, this is the fundamental way to prevent revisionism, and a reliable guarantee for broad cadres to maintain revolutionary youth. Proletarian cadres should be able to go up and down, be officials and common people, and serve the people wholeheartedly. The thought of "If I knew I would be sent down, why did I become a cadre" is actually an "official" thought, which is completely contrary to the revolutionary qualities that proletarian cadres should have.

"Do not rely on past merits, but create new ones." Revolutionary cadres must not lie on the "merit book" and "hardship book." If one is always thinking about "even if there is no merit, there is still hardship," and does not consciously insist on reform and continue to advance, then that is the beginning of becoming a revisionist. Cadres going down to the countryside for labor, this is the instruction of our great leader Chairman Mao. Proletarian cadres must listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Otherwise, which class's cadre are you?

Some comrades also "urgently demand" to go down to the countryside for labor, but their motives are wrong, not for reforming their worldview, but for "unloading burdens and feeling light." In their minds, there is a wrong idea, that is, the so-called "cadres are hard to be," fearing to make mistakes. Such comrades should think carefully, why do some cadres make mistakes? It should be said that an important reason why some cadres make mistakes is that they have separated from labor and the masses. Laziness, greed, occupation, greed, and revisionism all start from separating from labor, gradually walking on the wrong path of revisionism. Are there not enough such lessons? Some people, even if they have not reached the degree of becoming revisionists, but because they have separated from labor and the masses, they cannot follow Chairman Mao closely, do not understand the continuation of the proletarian dictatorship revolution, and thus make various mistakes. This means that the problem is not whether cadres are hard to be, but whether they can often participate in collective production labor, blend with the masses, consult with the masses on matters, and serve the people wholeheartedly. If they can do this, they will not make or make fewer mistakes, and will definitely gain the support of the broad masses.

    干部下放劳动是革命化必由之路
    大通煤矿工人　姜茂亭
    “广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”毛主席的这个最新指示，是对广大革命干部最大的关怀，为干部革命化指明了方向。
    对毛主席最新指示，抱什么态度，是认真贯彻执行，还是消极应付，甚至阳奉阴违？这是区别真革命和假革命的试金石。我们的广大革命干部热烈响应毛主席伟大号召，认真学习、坚决落实毛主席最新指示。但也有一些干部却不是这样，他们在打自己的小算盘。口头上也说“坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召”，心里想的却是另一回事。什么“参加工作十几年了，没有功劳也有苦劳”啦！什么“早知要下放，何必当干部”啦！有这种思想的人，难道是在坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召吗？
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”有些干部长期住大楼、坐办公室，脱离劳动，脱离群众。这种情况如不彻底改变，就难免会变“修”。干部下放劳动，到火热的阶级斗争中去、生产斗争第一线去“经风雨，见世面”，加强思想革命化，彻底改造世界观，这才是反修防修的根本途径，是广大干部永葆革命青春的可靠保证。无产阶级的干部，应该是能上能下、能“官”能民，全心全意为人民服务。那种“早知要下放，何必当干部”的思想，其实是一种“当官”思想，同无产阶级干部应有的革命品质，是完全背道而驰的。
    “不要吃老本，要立新功。”革命干部千万不能躺在“功劳簿”、“苦劳簿”上。如果耿耿于怀的是“没有功劳也有苦劳”，而不自觉坚持改造、继续前进，那就是变“修”的开始。干部下放劳动，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席的指示，无产阶级的干部一定要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。否则，你算是哪个阶级的干部呢？
    有的同志也“迫切要求”下放劳动，然而，他的动机不对，不是为了改造世界观，而是为了“卸担子，落得一身轻松”。在他的脑子里有一种错误的想法，即所谓“干部不好当”，怕犯错误。这样的同志应该好好想一想，有些干部为什么犯错误？应该说，有些干部犯错误很重要的一条原因，就是脱离了劳动，脱离了群众。懒、馋、占、贪、变，从脱离劳动开始，逐步走上修正主义的邪路，这样的教训难道还少吗？有的人即使还没有达到变“修”的程度，但因为脱离了劳动，脱离了群众，因而就不能紧跟毛主席，对无产阶级专政条件下继续革命就不理解，因而犯了这样那样的错误。这就是说，问题不在于干部好不好当，而在于能不能经常地参加集体生产劳动，和群众打成一片，遇事与群众商量，全心全意为人民服务。如果能够这样，就会不犯或少犯错误，也一定能得到广大群众的拥护。
