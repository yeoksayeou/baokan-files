Chairman Mao Warmly Congratulates Comrade Enver Hoxha on His 60th Birthday

New China News Agency, October 15th – On the 15th, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, expressing his heartfelt, warm, and fraternal congratulations on Comrade Hoxha's 60th birthday. The full text of the congratulatory message is as follows:

	Tirana
	Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania
	First Secretary
	Dear Comrade Enver Hoxha:

	On the occasion of your 60th birthday, I, on behalf of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, and in my personal capacity, extend to you my heartfelt, warm, and fraternal congratulations.

	You are the founder of the glorious Party of Labour of Albania and the great leader of the heroic Albanian people. The transformation of Albania from a poor and backward country into an advanced and strong socialist country is closely linked to your correct leadership.

	You creatively combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Albanian revolution. You lead the Albanian people in establishing proletarian dictatorship through armed struggle, building socialism through self-reliance, deeply and continuously carrying out the revolutionization movement, and waging a struggle against imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries. You have made outstanding contributions to the world proletarian revolutionary cause and to the enrichment and development of Marxism-Leninism.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha, your glorious history proves that you are truly a great and courageous fighter for Marxism-Leninism.

	The revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Albania has been tested by fierce international class struggles. The power generated by this friendship is boundless and truly invincible. Let us, together with all the genuine Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world, forge even closer ties and fight shoulder to shoulder to bury thoroughly the common enemy of the world's peoples, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism!

	I wish the Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people new victories and new achievements. I wish the friendship between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania eternal. I wish you, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, good health and longevity.

		Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong

    恩维尔·霍查同志，您的光荣的历史证明，您真不愧为一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的英勇战士。
    中阿两国人民的革命友谊，是经过激烈的国际阶级斗争考验的。这种友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽和真正无敌的。让我们两党、两国人民同全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者、各国革命人民更紧密地团结起来，为彻底埋葬世界人民的公敌美帝、苏修而并肩战斗！
    祝阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民取得新的胜利和新的成就。祝中阿两党、两国人民的友谊万古长青。祝您，阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友，健康长寿。
