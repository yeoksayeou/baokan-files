	Hearts aflame, wills as steadfast as steel
	Special-grade hero, deputy political instructor of the company where Yang Rensheng served, Wu Yichao

	Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing has personally cultivated the brilliant and dazzling modern revolutionary Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," which successfully portrays the glorious image of our proletarian revolutionary fighters and enthusiastically praises the People's Liberation Army with "hearts aflame and wills as steadfast as steel."

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The army must blend with the people, so that the army appears in the eyes of the people as their own army. Such an army is invincible in the world." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" vividly reflects the essence of our army, which comes from the people, relies on the people, and fights for the people's interests.

	Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and caring for the people's hardships are the glorious traditions of our army. The anti-bandit squad led by Yang Zhirong deeply understands that to take root in the vast forest and snow-covered plains and complete the arduous task of annihilating the remnants of bandits, they must closely rely on the people.

	As the curtain rises, the touching scene of the People's Liberation Army loving the people unfolds before us: they enter the deep mountains and old forests, searching for the common people along the way, visiting the poor, and awakening them to educate the people.

	Yang Zhirong risks his life to save the daughter of a hunter. The plight of the hunter's family, "every word dripping with blood, every sound filled with tears," ignites Yang Zhirong's burning anger. The scene "Asking About Hardships in the Deep Mountains" expresses the lofty and deep class feelings between revolutionary fighters and the oppressed people.

	The small squad led by Xiao Jianbo arrives at Jia Pigu, seeing the tragic scene of the villagers being trampled and tormented by the bandit Seatiger. This further ignites their hatred for the enemy and their love for the people. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings, thinking what the people think and worrying about what the people worry about. Hearing that the old woman is sick, "quickly call the medic"; seeing that her pot is empty, the soldiers hurriedly throw down their rations; in the snowstorm, the squad members put their coats on Li Mu's mother... This is not just a bag of rations, a coat, but the care of the Party and the warmth of the children of the Chairman sent by Mao Zedong! They strictly observe the "three major disciplines and eight points for attention," with high revolutionary spirit and deep class feelings, family by family, household by household, patiently propagating the Party's policies, and doing meticulous political and ideological work. All this makes Li Yongqi and the broad masses of Jia Pigu see it with their own eyes and think about it in their hearts, thinking and comparing: "Since ancient times, soldiers and bandits have been one family oppressing the people," but "these soldiers treat the sick and save lives in times of difficulty, and they are friendly and kind." This forms a stark contrast with the brutal and vicious oppression of the people by the reactionary Kuomintang and the bandit Seatiger! Li Yongqi sincerely vows from the bottom of his heart: "From now on, I will follow the Communist Party to drive away the tigers and wolves, whether it's walking through water or fire, or being crushed to death, I will be willing." The spirit and style of the children of the Chairman deeply educate the masses, awaken the class consciousness of the masses, and turn their hatred for the enemy into a great revolutionary force.

	Vice Chairman Lin says: "The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." The fighters of the anti-bandit squad led by Yang Zhirong are exactly such selfless and fearless heroes with collective courage and collective bravery. In front of the revolutionary people, they are diligent and dedicated "oxen"; in front of the cruel and brutal enemy, they are towering heroes who are invincible.

	The 36-person anti-bandit squad, deep in the forest and snow-covered plains, aims to capture the "Nine Groups, Twenty-Seven Forts" of Tiger Mountain, a heavily fortified stronghold, and annihilate the numerically superior bandit gang of Seatiger in a short period of time using the strategy of "taking by strategy." This is a dangerous and arduous battle. To completely annihilate the bandit gang of Seatiger, Yang Zhirong fearlessly sacrifices himself, single-handedly infiltrating Tiger Mountain. He is like a sharp sword piercing the enemy's heart, showing that in the face of revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome and no enemies that cannot be defeated.

	From "Climbing the Mountain to Fight the Tiger" to "Meeting at the Banquet of One Hundred Chickens," every round of struggle shows Yang Zhirong's heroic character of subduing all enemies. The cunning bandit leader Seatiger tried to test Yang Zhirong many times, but all failed; but the enemy did not give up, making another secret arrangement for a "drill" test. Yang Zhirong was in the midst of sending intelligence in a tense moment, the situation was extremely dangerous, and at any time, his identity might be exposed. However, the steadfast Yang Zhirong, in this critical situation, thought of "the Party has placed unlimited hopes in me" and "comrades spoke earnestly," so his fighting spirit was even stronger, and his confidence doubled, "even if it's a forest of swords and a mountain of blades, I will charge forward, overcoming all difficulties to descend the hill." He quickly came up with a plan, turning the tables and sending out the intelligence. Just as the bandit leader Seatiger's suspicions had not yet been dispelled, Lan Ping came to Tiger Mountain. Facing this sudden situation, Yang Zhirong was calm and composed, striking first. Just as Lan Ping insisted that he was a "Communist soldier" at a critical moment, he paid no heed to his personal safety, fearless and composed. He first subdued Lan Ping spiritually, seizing the enemy's contradictions and weaknesses, and striking them down. Hero Yang Zhirong, in this round after round of dangerous battles, was calm, clever, and with great heroism, tightly holding the enemy's nose and firmly grasping the initiative of the struggle. Yang Zhirong's daring to fight and daring to win, fearless revolutionary spirit, greatly boosted the morale of our revolutionary fighters and greatly dampened the spirits of all reactionaries.

	Hero Yang Zhirong has suffered deeply for generations. He hates the evil old society immensely and loves the Party, the people, and Chairman Mao dearly. For the revolution, he has "fought in countless battles, risked his life, and achieved great merits." His heroic deed of single-handedly infiltrating the tiger's den fully demonstrates the revolutionary fighters' loyalty to the revolutionary cause. He knows there are tigers in the mountains, but he still goes to the tiger's den; he knows there is no path in the mountains, but he is willing to be the pathbreaker.

	The image of Yang Zhirong shows that revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless of heaven and earth, invincible in the world. The hero's practice tells us: Great Mao Zedong Thought is the sunshine and rain that nurtures heroes, an inexhaustible source of power to overcome any difficulties and obstacles. Yang Zhirong can "endure the cold and turn ice and snow into water," fearless in the face of danger, because he has "the sun in his heart." He enters the tiger's den alone, thinking of "wishing the red flag to wave over the five continents and four seas," so he has the courage to "charge forward even if it's a sea of fire and a mountain of blades," "no matter how fierce the flames of Seatiger," "fight the devil for the people," "will strong and power strong." When infiltrating the bandit's den and sending intelligence, we see not only the image of a skilled and brave reconnaissance platoon leader, but first and foremost the image of a great revolutionary fighter with high revolutionary awareness, loyal to the Party and the people, and listening to the Party and Chairman Mao.

	Seeing Yang Zhirong in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is like seeing our old company commander Yang Rensheng in front of us. During the War of Liberation, he single-handedly charged into the enemy's ranks, captured a machine gun, and took prisoners. In a sniper battle in Korea, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our positions with several times our forces. At this critical moment, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, thought of the motherland, thought of the Korean people, and with deep hatred for the enemy, he hugged a bundle of explosives and charged into the enemy's ranks, showing the unlimited loyalty of a Communist Party member and revolutionary fighter to the Party and the people. Yang Zhirong is the embodiment of thousands and thousands of heroes in our army. These heroes have one thing in common: they are infinitely loyal to the Party, infinitely loyal to the people, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, with "hearts aflame and wills as steadfast as steel."

	Facing such proletarian heroes, we are moved and our fighting spirit is high. Every time we watch such a good play, we are deeply educated by Mao Zedong Thought, and our feelings for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deepen. We must learn the heroes' thoughts, walk the heroes' path, create heroes' achievements, and be loyal soldiers who defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death.

    心红红似火  志坚坚如钢
    特级英雄、杨根思生前所在连队副政治指导员　吴义超
    我们敬爱的江青同志亲手培育的光辉夺目的革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》，成功地塑造了我们无产阶级革命战士的光辉形象，热情洋溢地歌颂了“心红红似火，志坚坚如钢”的人民军队。
    毛主席教导我们：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。《智取威虎山》突出地反映了我军来自人民，依靠人民，为人民利益而战的人民军队的本质。
    相信群众，依靠群众，关心群众疾苦，这是我军的光荣传统。以杨子荣为代表的剿匪小分队深深懂得，要在茫茫无际的林海雪原中扎根，完成消灭残匪的艰巨任务，必须紧紧地依靠人民群众。
    拉开帷幕，人民子弟兵热爱人民的动人场面，立即展现在我们面前：他们进入深山老林，一路上寻找老百姓，访贫问苦，启发觉悟，教育人民。
    杨子荣冒着生命危险救起常猎户的女儿。常猎户一家的遭遇，“字字血，声声泪”，激起了杨子荣满腔怒火。“深山问苦”一场，表达了革命战士和被压迫人民之间崇高的深厚的阶级感情。
    少剑波带领的小分队来到夹皮沟，看到被土匪座山雕践踏、蹂躏的悲惨情景，更激起了他们对敌人的仇恨，对人民群众的热爱。他们处处遵照毛主席的教导，想群众所想，急群众所急。听到老大娘生病，“快把卫生员叫来”；看到她家的锅是空的，战士们忙把干粮丢下；风雪交加，小分队的战士把自己的大衣给李母披上……。这不仅是一袋干粮，一件大衣，而是党的关怀，毛主席派来的子弟兵的温暖啊！他们严守“三大纪律，八项注意”，以高度的革命精神和深厚的阶级感情，一家家，一户户，耐心地宣传党的政策，做深入细致的政治思想工作。这一切使李勇奇和夹皮沟的广大群众看在眼里，想在心中，想了又想，比了又比：“自古来兵匪一家欺压百姓”，可是“这些兵急人难治病救命，又嘘寒又问暖和气可亲”，这和国民党反动派、座山雕匪徒对人民群众凶残、暴虐的迫害，形成了多么鲜明的对照！李勇奇从心底里发出誓言：“从此我跟定共产党把虎狼撵，不管是水里走，火里钻，粉身碎骨也心甘”。子弟兵的这种精神和作风，深深地教育了群众，唤醒了群众的阶级觉悟，把对敌人的仇恨化为巨大的革命力量。
    林副主席说：“最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。”以杨子荣为代表的追剿小分队的战士们正是这样无私无畏、群威群胆的英雄。在革命人民面前，他们是勤勤恳恳为人民服务的“孺子牛”；在凶恶残暴的敌人面前，他们是顶天立地、所向无敌的英雄汉。
    三十六人的剿匪小分队，深入林海雪原，要在短时间内，用“智取”的办法，拿下“九群二十七地堡”、防备森严的威虎山，剿灭数量占优势的座山雕匪帮，这是一场惊险的艰苦的战斗。为了彻底消灭座山雕匪帮，杨子荣不怕牺牲，单枪匹马，打进威虎山。他象一把锋利的钢刀插进了敌人心脏，显示出在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士面前，没有克服不了的困难，没有战胜不了的敌人。
    从“打虎上山”到“会师百鸡宴”，每个回合的斗争，都显示了杨子荣要压倒一切敌人的英雄性格。狡猾的匪首座山雕，对杨子荣进行了多次的试探，结果都失败了；但是敌人并不死心，又一次暗作布置，进行“演习”试探。杨子荣正处在暗送情报的紧张时刻，情势十分险恶，随时都有暴露自己身份的可能。然而，心红志坚的杨子荣在这危难的情况下，想到的是“党对我寄托着无限希望”，“同志们语重心长”，因此，斗志更旺，信心倍增，“刀丛剑树也要闯，排除万难下山岗”，只见他灵机一动，将计就计，送出了情报。正当匪首座山雕疑虑未消的时候，栾平又来到威虎山。面对这突如其来的情况，杨子荣胸有成竹，先发制人，就在栾平咬定他是“共军”的关键时刻，他全不顾个人的安危，临危不惧，镇静自若。他首先从精神上压倒栾平，抓住敌人的矛盾和弱点，致敌于死地。英雄杨子荣在这一次又一次艰险的战斗中，沉着，机智，以大无畏的英雄气概，紧紧地牵住了敌人的鼻子，牢牢地掌握了斗争的主动权。杨子荣敢于斗争，敢于胜利的大无畏革命精神，大长了我们革命战士的志气，大灭了一切反动派的威风。
    英雄杨子荣祖祖辈辈苦大仇深。他对万恶的旧社会无比憎恨，对党对人民对毛主席无限热爱，为革命“身经百战、出生入死屡建勋劳”。他单枪匹马打进虎穴的英勇行为，充分表现了革命战士对革命事业的赤胆忠心。他明知山有虎，偏向虎山行；明知山无路，愿作开路人。
    杨子荣这个英雄形象，生动地显示出用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，天不怕，地不怕，无敌于天下。英雄的实践告诉我们：伟大的毛泽东思想，是英雄成长的阳光雨露，是战胜任何艰难险阻的取之不尽的力量源泉。杨子荣所以能“抗严寒化冰雪”，临危不惧，就是因为他“胸有朝阳”。他只身入虎穴，心里想的是“愿红旗五洲四海齐招展”，因此，他就有“哪怕是火海刀山也扑上前”的勇气，“任凭那座山雕凶焰万丈”，“为人民战恶魔”“志壮力强”。在打进匪窟、计送情报时，我们看到的不仅是武艺高强、勇敢机智的侦察排长的形象，而首先是一个具有高度革命觉悟，忠于党忠于人民，听党和毛主席话的高大的革命战士的光辉形象。
    看到《智取威虎山》中的杨子荣，就好象我们的老连长杨根思在眼前。解放战争中，他只身冲入敌群，缴获机枪，俘虏敌人。在朝鲜的一次狙击战斗中，敌人以数倍于我的兵力向我阵地猛扑。在这千钧一发之际，他想到毛主席的教导，想到祖国，想到朝鲜人民，怀着对敌人的刻骨仇恨，抱起炸药包冲向敌群，表现了共产党员、革命战士对党对人民的无限忠诚。杨子荣是我军千千万万个英雄的化身。这些英雄有一个共同点，就是无限忠于党，无限忠于人民，无限忠于毛主席，“心红红似火，志坚坚如钢”。
    面对这样的无产阶级英雄，我们心情激动，斗志昂扬。每看一次这样的好戏，就深受一次毛泽东思想的教育，对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线的感情就深一分。我们一定要学习英雄的思想，走英雄的道路，创英雄的业绩，做誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的忠诚战士。
