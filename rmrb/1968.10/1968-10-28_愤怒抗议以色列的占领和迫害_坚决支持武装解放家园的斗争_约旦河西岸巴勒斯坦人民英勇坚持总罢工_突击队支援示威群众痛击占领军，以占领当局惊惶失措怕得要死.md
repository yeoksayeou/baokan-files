The Palestinian people on the West Bank of the Jordan River have been bravely holding a general strike against Israeli occupation and oppression for nine days since October 18. Protest marches have spread to many towns and villages on the West Bank. Many protesters have courageously resisted the bloody suppression by the Israeli occupying authorities.

Protest marches by the Palestinian people in Jenin, Nablus, Hebron, Ramallah, Bireh, Tulkarm, and the Arab districts of Jerusalem are still ongoing. The protests have now spread to the towns and villages of Kabatiya and Asira on the West Bank. The general strike and protests have also spread to the Gaza Strip.

Facing the surging protests of the Palestinian people, the Israeli occupying authorities are in a state of panic, arresting people en masse, even deploying tanks and armored vehicles, using tear gas, and brutally suppressing the protesters. They killed 15 students in Jenin and injured protesters in other cities. The heinous crimes of the Israeli occupying authorities have further fueled the Palestinian people's resistance. More people are joining the protests.

In Nablus, over 5,000 students, teachers, and residents participated in the protest march. The scale and momentum of the protest were unprecedented in the city. The protesters shouted slogans such as "Israel invaders, get out of our homeland," "Palestine belongs to the Arabs," "We support armed struggle and the activities of the Palestinian commandos," "Reject compromise, reject negotiations," and more. As they fought hand-to-hand with the Israeli occupying forces, the Palestinian commandos suddenly appeared, supporting their struggle, destroying two Israeli tanks, and killing and injuring a group of Israeli occupying forces who were suppressing the protests.

In Ramallah, female students protesting threw stones at the Israeli occupying forces and injured the Israeli occupying forces' leader in Ramallah. In Jenin, the Israeli occupying forces massacred 15 students, which further enraged the Palestinian people. Including women, the protesters fought the Israeli occupying forces with sticks and stones and attacked the Israeli police posts and patrols in the city. The villagers of Kabatiya also held protests, throwing stones at the Israeli military convoys passing through the village.

The Israeli Zionist leaders, "Defense Minister" Dayan and "Chief of Staff" Bar-Lev, are terrified of the Palestinian people's brave struggle. They hurriedly went to Ramallah, Bireh, and Nablus to plan further suppression measures. They panickedly shouted that "public security on the West Bank has been disrupted" and that they would use "all military means at their disposal" to suppress the general strike and protest marches. The enemy's savage suppression will not intimidate the fearless Palestinian people. Currently, the general strike is still ongoing, and the scale of the protest marches is growing.

    愤怒抗议以色列的占领和迫害　坚决支持武装解放家园的斗争
    约旦河西岸巴勒斯坦人民英勇坚持总罢工
    突击队支援示威群众痛击占领军，以占领当局惊惶失措怕得要死
    新华社大马士革二十六日电　据阿拉伯叙利亚通讯社消息和叙利亚报纸报道，约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦人民，十八日开始举行的抗议以色列占领和迫害的总罢工已经进入第九天。示威游行扩展到了约旦河西岸的许多城镇和一些村庄。许多示威者英勇地反抗以色列占领当局的血腥镇压。
    在约旦河西岸的杰宁、纳布卢斯、哈利勒、拉马拉、比拉、图勒卡姆和耶路撒冷阿拉伯区的巴勒斯坦人民举行的示威游行还在继续进行，示威游行目前已经扩展到约旦河西岸的卡巴提亚和阿西拉等市镇和村庄。这次总罢工和示威还扩展到加沙地带。
    以色列占领当局面临汹涌澎湃的巴勒斯坦人民示威运动，惊惶失措，大肆捕人，甚至出动坦克和装甲车，使用催泪弹，血腥镇压示威群众，杀害了杰宁的十五名学生，打伤了其他城市的一些示威者。以色列占领当局的滔天罪行，更加激起了巴勒斯坦人民奋起反抗，参加示威的人越来越多。
    在纳布卢斯，有五千多名学生、教员、男女居民参加了示威游行。其人数之多、声势之大，都是这个城市前所未有的。示威者高呼：“以色列侵略者，从我们的家园滚出去”、“巴勒斯坦属于阿拉伯人”、“我们支持武装斗争和巴勒斯坦突击队的活动”、“拒绝和解，拒绝谈判”等口号。正当他们赤手空拳地同以色列占领军搏斗时，巴勒斯坦突击队突然出现，支援他们的战斗，击毁了两辆以色列坦克，打死打伤进行镇压的一批以色列占领军。
    在拉马拉，示威的女学生向以色列占领军扔石块，还打伤了拉马拉以色列占领军头目。在杰宁，以色列占领军屠杀了十五名学生，这更加激起了巴勒斯坦人民的愤慨，包括妇女在内的示威者用木棍和石块同以色列占领军进行了搏斗，并袭击了市内的以色列警察岗哨和巡逻队。卡巴提亚的村民也举行示威，向经过这个村子的以色列军用车队投掷石块。
    以色列犹太复国主义头子“国防部长”达扬和“参谋长”巴勒夫，对巴勒斯坦人民的英勇斗争怕得要死，急忙赶到拉马拉、比拉和纳布卢斯，策划进一步的镇压措施。他们惊慌地叫嚷“西岸的公共治安目前已遭到破坏”，要使用“自己拥有的一切军事手段”来镇压总罢工和示威游行。敌人的疯狂镇压是吓不倒不畏强暴的巴勒斯坦人民的，目前，总罢工仍在继续举行，示威游行的规模越来越大。
