U.S. imperialist aircraft stationed at bases in Thailand have been dropping bombs indiscriminately, recklessly taking lives. This is yet another heinous crime committed by the U.S. against the Thai people.

According to reports from Thai newspapers, on September 27, a U.S. aggressor plane that took off from the U.S. air base in Nakhon Phanom dropped bombs randomly, killing and injuring ten innocent Thai people. On October 2, another U.S. refueling aircraft that took off from the U.S. air base in Udon Thani crashed and exploded in a nearby forest, starting a fire that destroyed a large area of forest and damaged many homes, causing severe losses to the local people.

Prior to this, on August 27, two U.S. F-105 fighter-bombers dropped bombs near the U.S. air base in Ubon Ratchathani, injuring two Thai people. Not long ago, in the Wan Nopphaburi area of Ubon Ratchathani, a U.S. aggressor plane fired a missile at random, resulting in the deaths of four local farmers and injuries to seventy-one others.

These criminal acts by U.S. imperialism have sparked increasing anger among the Thai people. The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station pointed out that the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. aggressor troops against the Thai people must be reckoned with, and the Thai people must demand blood debt from U.S. imperialism.

    美帝飞机在泰国乱扔炸弹犯下滔天罪行
    激起泰国人民越来越强烈的愤怒
    据新华社讯　美帝国主义驻在泰国基地的飞机，在泰国乱扔炸弹，草菅人命。这是美帝对泰国人民犯下的又一滔天罪行。
    据泰国报纸报道，九月二十七日，在那空拍侬府美国空军基地起飞的一架美国强盗飞机，竟把炸弹随便扔下来，炸死炸伤了十名无辜的泰国人。十月二日，又有一架从乌塔保美国空军基地起飞的空中加油机，在机场附近的一处森林坠落，爆炸起火，烧毁了大片林木和毁坏了许多民房，给当地人民造成了严重的损失。
    在此以前，八月二十七日，有两架美国F—105式战斗轰炸机在乌汶府美国空军基地附近扔下炸弹，炸伤了两名泰国人。不久以前，在乌汶府万侬碧地区上空，一架美国强盗飞机随意发射一枚火箭，造成当地农民四人死亡，七十一人受伤。
    美帝国主义的这些罪恶行径，激起了泰国人民越来越强烈的愤怒。“泰国人民之声”电台指出，美国侵略军对泰国人民犯下的滔天罪行一定要清算，泰国人民一定要向美帝国主义讨还血债。
