The reactionary regime in India is in complete disarray. The "aid" begged by the Indian reactionary government is not enough to repay debts. The fascist military regime in Indonesia is implementing a sellout policy that brings disaster to the country.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: Indian newspapers have revealed that the external "aid" begged by the Indian government this year is not enough to repay debts. The total debt to be repaid this year amounts to $588 million, but the new "aid" obtained is unlikely to exceed $500 million.

Indian newspapers admit that the debt situation will worsen in the coming years. In the 1969-1970 fiscal year, the Indian reactionary government will have to repay $724 million in debts; in the 1970-1971 fiscal year, the debt will reach $835 million. In other words, in the coming years, even if the Indian reactionary government begs for more new "aid," it may still end up repaying debts and having nothing left.

This year, the Indian reactionary government begged the "India Aid Consortium" for $900 million, but so far, the consortium has only agreed to provide $290 million. This is mainly because the main members of the consortium, the U.S. imperialists, are facing a serious financial crisis.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, under the severe impact of the massive export of commodities and capital by the monopolistic capitalist groups of the U.S., Britain, and other countries, the enterprises opened by Indonesian national capitalists in Jakarta are closing down one after another. A large number of private textile businesses are bankrupt, and a large number of workers are unemployed. Many university graduates cannot find jobs after graduation.

Due to the ruthless exploitation by imperialism, the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, and the feudal landlord class, a large number of impoverished farmers in Java have lost their land and migrated to Jakarta. In various parts of Jakarta, on the streets, under the eaves, next to garbage piles, and under bridges, there are homeless people everywhere. It is estimated that the number of unemployed homeless people roaming the streets of Jakarta is over 300,000.

Extreme poverty severely undermines the health of the people, and various diseases are spreading in the city. Recently, a doctor in Jakarta revealed that in a city of over 3 million people, there are 30,000 blind people.

    反动统治一团糟
    印度反动政府乞讨来的“援助”还不够还债印尼法西斯军人政权的卖国政策祸国殃民
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：据印度报纸透露，印度政府今年乞讨到的外“援”还不够还债，今年要偿还的债务总数达五亿八千八百万美元，但是新取得的“援助”很少可能超过五亿美元。
    印度报纸承认，在今后几年中，债务的情况将会更糟糕。一九六九——一九七○年度印度反动政府将要偿还七亿二千四百万美元的债；一九七○——一九七一年度债务将达八亿三千五百万美元。换句话说，印度反动政府在最近几年内，即使乞讨到较多的新“援助”，但是实际上可能还债就还光了，一个钱也剩不了。
    今年，印度反动政府向“援印财团”伸手要九亿美元，但是到现在为止这个财团只答应给二亿九千多万美元。这主要是因为财团的主要成员美帝国主义陷入了严重的财政危机。
    据新华社讯　在美、英等国垄断资本集团大量的商品和资本输出的严重打击下，印尼民族资本家在雅加达开设的企业纷纷倒闭，大批民间花裙业破产，大量工人失业。许多大学生毕业以后找不到职业。
    由于帝国主义、官僚买办资产阶级和封建地主阶级残酷剥削的结果，爪哇岛大批贫苦农民失去了土地，流入雅加达。在雅加达市内各处，在街头，在屋檐下，在垃圾堆旁，在桥下，到处都是游民。有人估计，流浪在雅加达街头的无业游民，总数在三十万人以上。
    极端贫困的生活，严重地摧残了人民的健康，各种疾病在市内蔓延。据雅加达一个医生最近透露，在三百多万人口的雅加达，双目失明的盲人就有三万人。
