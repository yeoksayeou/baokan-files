Kuroda Jitsuo, the head of the delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, returned to Tokyo on the 18th and gave a speech praising China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The delegation participated in the celebrations marking the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and visited China for three weeks.

At a press conference held at the airport, Kuroda said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao is achieving comprehensive victory. This revolution is turning China into an unshakable socialist power and the most reliable stronghold of revolutionary forces worldwide. The excellent situation that has emerged under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought stands in sharp contrast to the increasing difficulties faced by U.S. imperialism and the growing bankruptcy of Soviet revisionism."

Kuroda stated that, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Chinese working class, which plays a leading role, is closely cooperating with the People's Liberation Army and has taken the stage in all superstructures. He emphasized: "This is indeed an unprecedented glorious achievement in history."

Kuroda concluded by saying: "The 700 million Chinese people highly praise the powerful and persistent struggle of the Japanese people to withdraw U.S. military bases and recover Okinawa."

    黑田寿男回到东京发表访华观感
    赞扬中国工人阶级登上上层建筑舞台
    新华社十九日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日中友好协会（正统）、日中文化交流协会联合代表团团长黑田寿男，十八日回到东京时发表谈话，热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    这个代表团参加了中华人民共和国成立十九周年庆祝活动，并在中国访问了三个星期。
    黑田寿男在机场上举行的记者招待会上说：“伟大领袖毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正在取得全面胜利。这场革命正在使中国成为永不变色的社会主义大国和全世界革命力量最可靠的堡垒。在毛泽东思想的指导下出现的大好形势，同美帝国主义日益严重的困难和苏联修正主义日益严重的破产，形成了鲜明的对比。”
    黑田说，按照毛主席的最新指示，起领导作用的中国工人阶级，同解放军紧密合作，登上了所有上层建筑的舞台。他强调说：“这确实是历史上前所未有的光辉成就。”
    黑田最后强调说：“七亿中国人民对日本人民目前正在进行的争取撤除美军基地和收复冲绳的有力、持久的斗争，表示高度赞扬。”
