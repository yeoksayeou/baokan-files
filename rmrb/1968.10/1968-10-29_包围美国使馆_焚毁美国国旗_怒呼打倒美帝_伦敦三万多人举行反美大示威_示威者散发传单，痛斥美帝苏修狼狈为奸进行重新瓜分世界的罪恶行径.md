Three hundred thousand people held an unprecedented anti-U.S. imperialist demonstration in London on the 27th. Several thousand demonstrators marched to the U.S. Embassy, burned the U.S. flag, shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism," and bravely fought with the police who came to suppress them.

The participants were mainly young people and workers from London and cities such as Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle, Glasgow, Coventry, Oxford, Cambridge, and Sussex. Many people from Asia, Africa, and Latin America residing in Britain, as well as young students who recently came from continental Europe and Canada, also participated in the demonstration.

That afternoon, the enthusiastic demonstrators, shouting slogans like "Murderous U.S. imperialists, get out of Vietnam," set off from the Thames Riverbank, passed through Fleet Street and the Embankment, and arrived at Trafalgar Square. Then, one group marched to the U.S. Embassy, while another went to the British Prime Minister's residence.

The demonstrators held up large portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao. Many banners and placards read: "U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers!" "Workers of all countries, unite to smash U.S. imperialism!" "Victory belongs to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. imperialism!" Some placards also had slogans calling for the expulsion of the Soviet revisionists from Czechoslovakia.

Some demonstrators distributed leaflets denouncing the collusion between U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique in their evil deeds. The leaflets said: "U.S. imperialism is in a miserable plight both domestically and internationally.... The Soviet revisionist clique is making deals with U.S. imperialism to redivide the world and spheres of influence. After obtaining the Johnson administration's tacit approval for its military occupation of Czechoslovakia, it allows U.S. imperialism to do as it pleases in Vietnam and the Middle East." The leaflets also exposed the British Labour government's crimes in suppressing the people's active support for U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

The British reactionary authorities were terrified of this massive demonstration. They mobilized seven thousand police officers and many helicopters and ships to monitor and suppress the demonstrators, with another seven thousand police officers on standby. The British government was particularly afraid of the people demonstrating at the U.S. Embassy, so they dispatched several thousand police officers there. British Home Secretary Callaghan and police chief Waldren personally supervised the scene. Additionally, the U.S. Embassy specially called in U.S. Marines to guard the premises.

However, the demonstrators were fearless. They bravely advanced towards the U.S. Embassy located at Grosvenor Square. By nightfall, the number of demonstrators increased, with thousands of people surrounding the U.S. Embassy for three hours. They burned the U.S. flag and shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "U.S. imperialists, go back!" They bravely fought with the police who came to suppress them, resulting in forty people being arrested and many more injured.

Many injured demonstrators were taken by ambulances dispatched by students from the London School of Economics to a medical station set up in the school for treatment. The students of this school, in order to prepare for this anti-U.S. imperialist demonstration in Vietnam, defied the reactionary principal's order to close the school on the weekend and occupied the school starting from the morning of the 25th. The students also distributed leaflets, calling on workers to join them in rebelling against the decaying capitalist system.

On the 26th, a group of students who demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy also held a demonstration in front of the Soviet Embassy. The slogans on their placards read: "Stop the U.S.-Soviet collusion against the Vietnamese people!" "Soviet revisionism supports the U.S. 'trap' in the Vietnam issue—smash the U.S.-Soviet collusion!"

    包围美国使馆　焚毁美国国旗　怒呼打倒美帝
    伦敦三万多人举行反美大示威
    示威者散发传单，痛斥美帝苏修狼狈为奸进行重新瓜分世界的罪恶行径
    新华社伦敦二十七日电　三万多人二十七日在伦敦举行规模空前的反对美帝侵越大示威。有几千名示威者游行到美国大使馆前，焚毁美国国旗，高呼“打倒美帝国主义”等口号，并同前往镇压的警察进行了英勇搏斗。
    参加示威的大都是伦敦和来自利物浦、曼彻斯特、伯明翰、利兹、纽卡斯尔、格拉斯哥、考文垂、牛津、剑桥、苏塞克斯等城市的英国青年和工人。旅居在英国的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的许多人士以及最近从欧洲大陆和加拿大来的青年学生，也参加了示威。
    这天下午，群情激昂的示威队伍高呼“杀人犯美国佬滚出越南”等口号，从泰晤士河岸出发，经过舰队街和河滨马路，到达特拉法加广场，然后有一路队伍前往美国大使馆，另一路前往英国首相府。
    示威者举着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的巨幅照片。许多横幅和标语牌上写着：“美帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎！”“各国工人团结起来，粉碎美帝国主义！”“胜利属于对美帝国主义进行斗争的英雄的越南人民！”有的标语牌上还写着苏修滚出捷克斯洛伐克的口号。
    一些示威者散发了传单，谴责美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团狼狈为奸，相互勾结的罪恶行径。传单说：“美帝国主义在国内外陷入悲惨的困境。……苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义进行重新瓜分世界和势力范围的交易。它在获得了约翰逊政府对其军事占领捷克斯洛伐克的默许之后，就让美帝国主义在越南和中东为所欲为。”传单还揭露了英国工党政府镇压人民群众积极支持美帝侵略越南的罪行。
    英国反动当局对这次声势浩大的示威怕得要死，它出动了七千名警察和许多直升飞机、舰艇等监视和镇压示威群众，另外还有七千名警察准备随时出动。英国政府特别害怕人民群众去美国大使馆示威，因此把好几千名警察派到那里去。英国内政大臣卡拉汉和警察头子沃尔德伦都亲自到场监督。此外，美国大使馆还专门把美国海军陆战队调来守卫。
    但是，示威群众毫不畏惧，他们勇敢地向着美国大使馆所在地格罗夫纳广场前进。入夜时分，示威者越聚越多，数以千计的人把美国大使馆包围起来达三小时之久。他们焚烧了美国国旗，高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义者滚回去！”等口号。示威群众同镇压的警察进行了英勇搏斗，有四十多人被捕，有更多的人受伤。
    许多受伤的示威群众由伦敦经济学院的学生派出救护车接到设在学院里的医疗站进行治疗。这家学院的学生为了替这次反对美帝侵越大示威作好准备，不顾反动院长关于在周末关闭学校的命令，从二十五日清晨开始占领学校。学生们还散发传单，呼吁工人同学生一起造腐朽的资本主义制度的反。
    在美国大使馆前示威的一群学生，二十六日还在苏联大使馆前举行了示威。他们举着的标语牌上面写着：“制止美苏勾结反对越南人民！”“苏联修正主义支持美国在越南问题上的谈判‘圈套’——粉碎美苏勾结！”等口号。
