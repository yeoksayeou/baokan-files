Workers, teachers, students, merchants, and residents of various cities and most towns on the West Bank of the Jordan River held a general strike, boycott of classes, and boycott of markets to protest the Israeli occupation of Arab lands and the crimes of oppressing the Arab people.

The general strike and other actions began on the 18th and are still ongoing. The affected areas include the cities of Nablus, Jenin, Hebron, Ramallah, Beita, Halhul, and the Arab districts of Jerusalem.

Since the Israeli occupation of the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Israeli authorities, in order to suppress the resistance of the Palestinian people, especially the activities of the Palestinian guerrillas on the West Bank of the Jordan River, have carried out mass arrests in various places, established concentration camps in each city, and forced Palestinian residents to become refugees. The atrocities of the Israeli authorities have sparked continuous resistance from the Palestinian people. On the 13th, several hundred Palestinian female students in Nablus demonstrated and were brutally suppressed by the Israeli military. This aroused the great indignation of the Palestinian people, leading to the outbreak of general strikes and other actions in various cities.

The occupying authorities of Israel were frightened by the brave actions of the Palestinian people and imposed curfews in all towns, closed schools, forced shops to open, threatened workers to return to factories, and arrested some people. However, these counter-revolutionary atrocities did not intimidate the brave Palestinian people. On the 18th, people from all walks of life in Palestine held demonstrations in Ramallah, and on the 21st, in all cities on the West Bank of the Jordan River. The demonstrators shouted slogans against the Israeli occupation. The flags they carried condemned all "political solutions" to the Palestinian issue and hailed the armed struggle of the Palestinian strike forces to liberate the occupied Arab lands.

    抗议以色列侵略者迫害阿拉伯人民的罪行
    约旦河西岸各城市巴勒斯坦人民总罢工
    新华社大马士革二十二日电　据阿拉伯叙利亚通讯社报道：约旦河西岸各城市和大部分市镇的巴勒斯坦工人、教师、学生、商人和居民举行总罢工、总罢课、总罢市，抗议以色列占领阿拉伯土地和迫害阿拉伯人的罪行。
    总罢工等行动从十八日开始，现仍在进行中。波及地区包括纳布卢斯、杰宁、哈利勒、拉马拉、比拉、哈勒呼勒和耶路撒冷阿拉伯区等城市。
    自从以色列占领约旦河西岸以来，以色列当局为了镇压巴勒斯坦人民的抵抗，特别是镇压巴勒斯坦游击队在约旦河西岸的活动，在各地进行了多次大逮捕，每个城市都建立了集中营，迫使巴勒斯坦居民流离失所。以色列当局的暴行，激起巴勒斯坦人民的不断反抗。十三日，纳布卢斯几百名巴勒斯坦女学生示威游行，遭到以色列军队的残酷镇压，这激起了巴勒斯坦人民极大愤怒，因而在各城市爆发了总罢工等行动。
    以色列占领当局被巴勒斯坦人民的英勇行动吓得惊慌失措，在所有的城镇实行宵禁，关闭学校，强迫商店营业，威吓工人回工厂，还逮捕了一些人。但是，它们的这种反革命暴行吓不倒英勇的巴勒斯坦人民。十八日，巴勒斯坦各界人民在拉马拉和二十一日在约旦河西岸的所有城市再次举行示威游行。示威者高呼反对以色列占领的口号。他们拿着的旗帜上面写着标语，谴责对巴勒斯坦问题的一切“政治解决”办法，并欢呼巴勒斯坦突击队为解放被占领的阿拉伯土地而进行的武装斗争。
