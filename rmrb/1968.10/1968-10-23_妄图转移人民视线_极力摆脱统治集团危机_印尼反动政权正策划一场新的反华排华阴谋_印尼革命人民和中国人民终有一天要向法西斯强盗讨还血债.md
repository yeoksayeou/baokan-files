The fascist military regime in Indonesia, in an attempt to alleviate the intensifying contradictions within its ruling clique and to divert the attention of the Indonesian people, is plotting a new anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese people conspiracy.

According to a report from the United States, on the 18th, two hundred thugs, with the connivance of the Indonesian fascist military regime, suddenly attacked a residence of an overseas Chinese in Jakarta. The report said that these thugs "destroyed this residence in five minutes." The report revealed that the thugs also planned to "attack" the shops of overseas Chinese in Jakarta, "one of the first targets of serious violence is the 10,000 overseas Chinese living in the Jakarta Grass Field area." Therefore, the Indonesian fascist military regime has planned to dispatch a group of thugs from outside to "loot and set fire" in the Grass Field commercial area of Jakarta.

According to another report, on the 21st, two thousand armed thugs in Indonesia stormed into the residential area of overseas Chinese in Surabaya, East Java, and committed atrocities for five hours. They set fire to the shops and houses of overseas Chinese, plundered the property of overseas Chinese, and brutally beat innocent overseas Chinese. It is revealed that many overseas Chinese were injured by this group of fascist thugs. This anti-Chinese violence was carried out in collaboration with the reactionary armed forces of Indonesia. A report from a Western news agency said that during the thugs' rampage, the Indonesian armed forces stood by, doing nothing to stop the violence.

According to a report from a reactionary newspaper in Indonesia, with the support of the fascist military regime in Indonesia, the Kuomintang bandits' activities in various parts of Indonesia have become increasingly rampant. Recently, the reactionary authorities in cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, Bogor, Sukabumi, Medan, Semarang, and Palembang have openly allowed Kuomintang bandits to hold "meetings" to "celebrate" the Kuomintang bandits' fake "national day," and have sent civil and military officials to "congratulate" them. This is another piece of evidence that the fascist military regime in Indonesia is following the U.S. imperialists in creating the "two Chinas."

Currently, the fascist military regime in Indonesia is in a very difficult situation. The infighting within the ruling clique has reached an unprecedented level of sharpness, the domestic economic situation is worsening, inflation is rampant, prices are soaring, and the people are suffering. The series of reactionary actions by this regime have aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction and resistance from the broad masses of the Indonesian people. In order to maintain its reactionary rule, this regime recently openly expressed to its American masters that it needs to beg for $500 million in foreign "aid" next year, almost double the amount of this year, and demanded that the U.S. imperialists, who are facing serious financial difficulties, give more crumbs.

The fascist military regime in Indonesia, which is now barely surviving, foolishly thinks that it can curry favor with its American masters by engaging in anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese people activities, in an attempt to save itself from destruction. However, the facts have proven and will continue to prove that this is in vain. The brave Indonesian people, who have taken up the path of armed revolution, and the seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will one day demand blood debt from the Indonesian fascist bandits!

    妄图转移人民视线　极力摆脱统治集团危机
    印尼反动政权正策划一场新的反华排华阴谋
    印尼革命人民和中国人民终有一天要向法西斯强盗讨还血债
    新华社二十二日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权为了缓和统治集团内部日益激化的矛盾并转移印尼人民视线，正策划一场新的反华排华阴谋。
    据美国通讯社透露，十八日，二百名暴徒在印尼法西斯军人政权的纵容下，突然袭击了雅加达的一家华侨住宅。消息说，这些暴徒“在五分钟内捣毁了这一家住宅”。消息透露，暴徒们还要“袭击”雅加达华侨商店，“严重的暴行的第一个目标之一就是居住在雅加达草埔区的一万名华侨”。因此，印尼法西斯军人政权已经策划从外地调动一批暴徒，“到雅加达的草埔华侨商业区进行劫掠和放火”。
    另据报道，二十一日，两千名印尼武装暴徒冲进了东爪哇泗水市华侨居住区，胡作非为达五小时之久。他们放火焚烧华侨商店和房屋，疯狂抢劫华侨财物，野蛮殴打无辜华侨。据透露，许多华侨被这批法西斯暴徒打伤。这次反华暴行是在印尼反动武装部队的配合下进行的。西方通讯社的消息说，在暴徒行凶时，印尼武装部队站在一边袖手旁观，“不做任何努力来制止暴行”。
    据印尼反动报纸透露，在印尼法西斯军人政权的支持下，蒋匪帮分子在印尼各地的活动日益猖獗。最近，雅加达、万隆、茂物、苏加武眉、棉兰、先达和巨港等城市的反动当局，公然允许蒋帮分子举行“集会”，“庆祝”蒋匪帮伪“国庆”，并派出文武官员前往“祝贺”。这是印尼法西斯军人政权追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的又一罪证。
    目前，印尼法西斯军人政权的日子很不好过。统治集团内部群狗之间的争斗空前尖锐，国内经济情况越来越糟，通货膨胀，物价飞涨，民不聊生。这个反动政权的一系列倒行逆施，引起了广大印尼人民日益强烈的不满和反抗。为了维持其反动统治，这个政权最近公开向它的美国主子表示，它明年需要乞讨五亿美元外“援”，几乎比今年增加一倍，并要求面临严重财政困难的美帝国主义能够多给些残羹剩饭。
    正在苟延残喘的印尼法西斯军人政权妄想用反华排华来向其美国主子“表功”，以图挽救自己覆灭的命运。但是，事实已经证明并将继续证明：这是徒劳的。已经走上武装革命道路的英勇的印度尼西亚人民和用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，终有一天要向印尼法西斯强盗讨还血债！
