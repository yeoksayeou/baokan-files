The strike struggles of American workers have surged forward this year, delivering increasingly heavy blows to the American monopoly capitalist class.

In recent years, especially last year, American workers' strike struggles have struck a heavy blow to the American ruling class, which, in early this year, frantically cried out that there should be no more strikes in the next two years. However, the tide of American workers' strikes continues to roll forward. This year, there have been major strikes by 30,000 taxi drivers and 10,000 sanitation workers in New York, 32,000 glass workers in 23 states, 90,000 coal miners, over 200,000 telecommunications workers nationwide, over 50,000 seamen, and 75,000 dock workers, one wave after another.

The surging strike struggles of American workers are the inevitable result of the American ruling class's intensified war and aggression policies abroad and its ruthless exploitation and oppression of American workers and the broad masses of laboring people at home. They are a direct reflection of the sharpening class contradictions within the United States.

The continuous surge in American workers' strike struggles indicates that American workers are accelerating their awakening. This is first evident in the significantly strengthened spirit of unity, struggle, and indomitability among American workers. Many major strikes last year lasted for a long time. The strike by 60,000 copper miners and smelters, which began last July and continued until this April, lasting nine months, is a prominent example. During these nine months, the monopoly capitalist class of the four major copper companies in the United States used every possible means to suppress the workers, but all were shattered by the workers.

The accelerating awakening of American workers is also evident in the increasing number of American workers who recognize that yellow unions are tools used by the American monopoly capitalist class to corrupt and control workers, and who actively take action to break free from the shackles of the yellow union leaders. In recent years, many important major strikes have been carried out despite the heavy obstruction of yellow union leaders. Among them, the strike by workers at the Mansfield automobile factory in Ohio forced General Motors to shut down its factories in the United States and Canada. From 1965 to 1968, about one million workers broke through the obstruction of yellow unions to carry out "spontaneous strikes." Particularly noteworthy is that many American workers have further realized that if they do not spit out the yellow union leaders and produce new leaders from the ranks of ordinary workers, the workers' movement cannot advance. There is a strong demand brewing among copper miners and other industrial workers to replace the yellow union leaders who act as tools of the capitalists. Currently, some industrial sectors are seeing the emergence of situations where ordinary workers are taking the initiative to establish their own leadership cores.

In recent years, American workers' daring to defy the American reactionary government and its laws and orders, fearlessly facing suppression and violence, is another notable feature of their accelerating awakening. To further exploit the American people and expand the Vietnam War, the Johnson administration has been frantically printing money to cause inflation and using various taxes to plunder the people's wealth, while also using the banner of "national interest" to prevent workers from increasing their wages. This is a vicious method used by the American monopoly capitalist class to attack the American working class through the state machine. However, the American working class has seen through this trick and has launched one wave after another of attacks on the so-called "wage adjustment line" set by the Johnson administration.

To suppress the surging tide of strikes, the Johnson administration issued a reactionary order in the first half of last year banning government employees from striking. In response, 25,000 workers in New York City immediately held a massive rally to strongly protest this order. Telephone workers in Illinois who went on strike in August and September this year cut off the cables leading to the Nike missile base and the U.S. Navy training center, fully demonstrating the American workers' spirit of defying the American reactionaries.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle of American blacks will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement, ultimately ending the evil rule of the American monopoly capitalist class."

The American workers' movement is increasingly converging with the black struggle, which is another sign of the American workers' accelerating awakening. In recent years, examples of white workers and black workers fighting side by side in workers' struggles have frequently appeared. For example, last July, 15,000 white and black workers at the Newport News shipyard jointly fought a strike, which was the first company-wide strike in the 80-plus-year history of the shipyard, forcing the largest shipyard in the United States, which builds nuclear submarines and Vietnam War ships for the U.S. Navy, to halt work. In this year's sanitation workers' strike, similar scenes of white and black workers fighting side by side also appeared.

At the same time, examples of white workers supporting black anti-violence struggles have also frequently appeared. For example, in 1966, when the black anti-violence struggle in Newark was at its height, thousands of black masses were bravely fighting against the "National Guard" and armed police who had driven tanks into the black neighborhood to wreak havoc. At this time, a large number of white workers held a demonstration in support of their black class brothers in the center of Newark. They held up signs saying "National Guard, get out of Newark immediately" and set up picket lines outside the city hall, demanding the immediate release of the 2,000 arrested black anti-violence fighters and an immediate stop to the police's violence, greatly encouraging and supporting the black anti-violence struggle.

The surging strike struggles of the American working class have dealt heavy blows to the crisis-ridden American economy and the reactionary social order, particularly seriously affecting the U.S. imperialists' military production and military deployments. For example, the strike by copper miners made almost all of the United States' copper mines and smelters "silent valleys," causing the United States to lose hundreds of thousands of tons of refined copper, directly affecting the copper needs of the Vietnam War industry. Again, the strike by railroad workers made 69 out of 76 major railroads in the United States completely paralyzed, with trains loaded with weapons and ammunition for the Vietnam War forced to stop on the tracks, causing many important industries to face the crisis of stopping work due to lack of materials.

The strike struggles of American workers also coordinate and resonate with the American people's struggle against the Vietnam War and the progressive student movement, merging into a tide of revolutionary struggle by the American people, continuously striking at the reactionary rule of American imperialism at home. With the further sharpening of class contradictions within the United States, the American working class, with its glorious tradition of struggle, will certainly further awaken, organize into a strong class force, lead the broad masses of the American people, and bravely advance to overthrow the evil rule of the American monopoly capitalist class.

    不怕反动派的镇压  不理工贼阻挠破坏  团结战斗坚韧不拔
    美国工人罢工斗争今年来迅速发展
    美国工人阶级在激烈的阶级搏斗中加速觉醒，给垄断资本沉重打击
    据新华社二十日讯　本社记者报道：今年以来，美国工人的罢工斗争蓬勃发展，给了美国垄断资产阶级以越来越沉重的打击。
    在最近几年，特别是去年美国工人罢工斗争的打击下，美国统治集团曾在今年年初气急败坏地叫嚷，今后两年内不许再有罢工。但是，美国工人罢工斗争的浪潮，继续滚滚向前。今年以来，纽约三万名出租汽车司机和一万名清洁工人的大罢工，全国二十三个州三万二千多名玻璃工人的大罢工，九万名煤矿工人的大罢工，全国二十多万电讯工人的大罢工，五万多名海员、七万五千名码头工人的大罢工等等，一浪接着一浪。
    美国工人罢工斗争的高涨，是美国统治集团对外加紧推行战争和侵略政策，对内残酷剥削和压迫美国工人阶级和广大劳动人民的必然结果，是美国国内阶级矛盾尖锐化的直接反映。
    美国工人罢工斗争的不断高涨表明，美国工人正在加速觉醒。这首先表现在美国工人团结战斗，坚韧不拔的精神正在大大加强。去年以来的许多次大罢工都坚持了很长时间。六万名铜矿和冶铜工人的大罢工，从去年七月开始，一直延续到今年四月，坚持了九个月，就是一个突出的例子。在这九个月中，美国四大铜业公司的垄断资产阶级对工人施尽了软硬兼施的手段，但是都一一被工人所粉碎。
    美国工人的加速觉醒还表现在越来越多的美国工人认识到黄色工会是美国垄断资产阶级腐蚀和控制工人的工具，并且积极行动起来冲破黄色工会头头的羁绊。最近几年来，许多次重要的大罢工，都是突破了黄色工会头头的重重阻挠而举行的。其中俄亥俄州曼斯菲尔德汽车工厂工人的一次罢工，迫使通用汽车公司在美国和加拿大的工厂停工。从一九六五年到一九六八年，约有一百万名工人突破了黄色工会的阻挠，举行了“自发性罢工”。尤其值得注意的是，许多美国工人进一步认识到如果不唾弃黄色工会的头头，并从基层普通工人队伍中产生新的领导，工人运动就不能前进。在铜矿工人和其他产业工人中正在酝酿着取代充当资本家工具的黄色工会头头的强烈要求。目前一些产业部门已不断出现由普通工人起来建立自己的领导核心的情况。
    美国工人在最近几年的斗争中敢于蔑视美国反动政府以及它制订的法律和禁令，不畏强暴，不怕镇压的斗争精神，更是美国工人加速觉醒的一个值得注意的特点。为了加紧压榨美国人民，扩大侵越战争，约翰逊政府在拚命滥发钞票造成通货膨胀，利用苛捐杂税搜刮民脂民膏的同时，还打起“国家利益”的旗号，不让工人增加工资。这是美国垄断资产阶级利用国家机器向美国工人阶级进攻的一个恶毒办法。但是美国工人阶级看透了这个花招，向约翰逊政府规定的所谓“工资调整线”发动了一次又一次的冲击。
    约翰逊政府为了压制日益高涨的罢工浪潮，曾在去年上半年制订了一项禁止政府雇员罢工的反动法令。对此，纽约市二万五千多名工人立即举行声势浩大的群众大会，强烈抗议这个法令。伊利诺斯州罢工的电话工人，在今年八、九两个月中曾切断了通往奈克式导弹基地和美国海军训练中心的电缆，充分显示了美国工人蔑视美国反动派的战斗精神。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。”
    美国工人运动正在和黑人斗争日益接近，这是美国工人加速觉醒的又一个标志。最近几年来，在工人斗争中，白人工人和黑人工人并肩战斗的事例不断出现。例如去年七月纽波特纽斯船舶修建厂一万五千名白人工人和黑人工人的共同战斗就是一个突出的例子。这次大罢工最初由这个工厂的运输部门的二百名黑人工人发起，迅速得到了全公司一万五千名白人工人和黑人工人的共同响应，举行了建厂八十多年来第一次全厂总罢工，使这家美国最大的造船厂替美国海军修造核潜艇和侵越舰只的工程被迫停工。在今年的清洁工人大罢工中，都同样出现了白人工人和黑人工人并肩战斗的动人情景。
    与此同时，白人工人声援黑人抗暴斗争的事例也不断出现。例如一九六六年纽瓦克爆发的黑人抗暴斗争正处在炽烈阶段，数千黑人群众正同驾着坦克闯入黑人区逞凶肆虐的“国民警卫队”和武装警察进行英勇搏斗，这时，大批白人工人在纽瓦克市中心举行了声援黑人阶级兄弟的示威。他们高举着“国民警卫队立即滚出纽瓦克”的标语牌，在市政厅外面布置了纠察线，要求立即释放被捕的两千名黑人抗暴战士和立即停止警察的暴行，给了黑人抗暴斗争以极大的鼓舞和支持。
    蓬勃发展的美国工人阶级的罢工斗争，沉重地打击了危机四伏的美国经济和美国的反动社会秩序，特别是严重地影响了美帝的军火生产和军事调动。例如铜矿工人的大罢工使美国几乎所有的铜矿和冶炼厂变成“一片沉寂的山谷”，使美国损失精铜一百几十万吨，直接影响到侵越军火工业对铜的需要。再如铁路工人的大罢工，使得美国七十六条主要铁路中的六十九条完全陷于瘫痪，一列列满载供应侵越战争所需武器弹药的军火列车被迫停在轨道上，使许多重要工业面临停工待料的危机。
    美国工人的罢工斗争还和美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争以及进步的学生运动互相配合，互相呼应，汇合成美国人民革命斗争的浪潮，不断冲击着美国帝国主义在国内的反动统治。随着美国国内阶级矛盾的进一步尖锐化，有着光荣斗争传统的美国工人阶级必将进一步觉醒起来，组织成一支坚强的阶级队伍，率领美国广大的人民群众，为推翻美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治，而勇猛前进。
