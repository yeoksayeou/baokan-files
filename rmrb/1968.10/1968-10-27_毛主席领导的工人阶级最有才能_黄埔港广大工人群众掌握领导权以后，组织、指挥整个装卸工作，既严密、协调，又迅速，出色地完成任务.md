At the moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved a comprehensive victory, the busiest place in China's southern region is the largest port, Huangpu Port. Dozens of ships are anchored in the port, day and night, loading and unloading tens of millions of tons of cargo.

A 10,000-ton foreign merchant ship is currently unloading at the dock. Five 30-40 meter high gantry cranes and four large hoists are operating simultaneously, unloading tons of cargo from nine cargo holds, and transporting them out of the port via trains, trucks, and barges. On the dock, thousands of workers are laboring intensely with the proud spirit of the working class taking charge. The entire loading and unloading operation is so well-organized and coordinated, and the work is so swift, that even the captain of the foreign ship cannot help but repeatedly exclaim, "The Chinese workers in the Mao Zedong era are truly amazing!" Those who organized and directed all this are not some "experts" or "authorities," but ordinary dock workers who have been carrying bamboo poles for over a decade at Huangpu Port.

Such a thing had never happened at Huangpu Port before. Only after the broad masses of workers not only seized political leadership but also firmly grasped the reins of production technology did the working class fully demonstrate its boundless power and extraordinary talent.

Production Technology Power Must Be Seized

At Huangpu Port, the working class seizing the power of production technology was the result of a fierce class struggle.

In July of this year, just before and after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Huangpu Port, production declined, and various accidents increased. Shortly before the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, a foreign merchant ship insisted that its cargo be loaded within three days, otherwise, it would return the goods and impose fines. At that time, a capitalist-roader in charge of the production office deliberately delayed time, created contradictions, and attempted to provide domestic and foreign class enemies with reactionary excuses to attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of workers promptly exposed the enemy's plot, uncovered this capitalist-roader, and seized the command of loading this ship's cargo. After a two-day and two-night struggle, they completed the loading task one day ahead of schedule, shattering the class enemy's evil plot.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the class enemy continued to use the partial production command and technical power they still controlled to sabotage production and attack the working class. They assumed an air of "experts" and "authorities," mystifying certain professional technologies, bullying the masses of workers, arbitrarily manipulating the ships being loaded and unloaded at the port, and making our manpower inefficient and the loading and unloading machinery unable to function fully. They attempted to dismantle the newly established red political power.

Faced with these situations, the Revolutionary Committee organized the masses of workers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. The great leader Chairman Mao taught, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." Everyone deeply understood that the class enemy, using the partial production technology power they controlled and the remnants of revisionism in ideology and institutions, was "attacking" us. This is the continuation of class struggle. Everyone deeply felt that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the working class must not only seize power politically but must also thoroughly seize the power of production to consolidate the leadership of the working class and complete the great task of "grasp revolution, promote production."

With the understanding unified, the Revolutionary Committee led the broad masses of workers to launch a fierce attack on the hidden class enemies. A capitalist-roader who controlled the entire port's production command organization was exposed by the masses of workers, and the Revolutionary Committee immediately reorganized this production command organization. Following this, the class enemies hidden in various production units and technical departments were successively exposed by the masses of workers. The leadership of the production command and technical departments usurped by these bad elements was successively seized back.

The working class truly took charge, the broad masses of workers were elated, and the face of Huangpu Port was completely renewed. Production soared. Although a large number of workers were sent to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and other work in August, the port's throughput still increased by 51% compared to July. In September, it continued to increase by 66%.

"The Bamboo Pole Carriers" Have the Most Talent

While fiercely exposing the class enemies, the Huangpu Port Revolutionary Committee continuously selected production technology cadres from among the workers. Most of those selected were workers with low cultural levels, and many had never even attended school. Some people doubted: could they organize production well and command it? Could they master complex technologies?

These doubts had deep class roots. For many years, capitalist-roaders, in order to monopolize the power of production technology and promote the revisionist line, on the one hand, elevated bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" to "thrones" and recruited remnants of the Kuomintang, intimidating workers by saying, "Without these experts and insiders, socialism cannot be built." On the other hand, they set up numerous obstacles, suppressing workers from learning production technology, preventing them from displaying their organizational and command talents in production. They maliciously slandered dock workers as "hollow bamboo poles" and "incompetent bamboo pole carriers."

The great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." The Revolutionary Committee, using Chairman Mao's latest directive as a weapon, mobilized the broad masses of workers to thoroughly criticize the bourgeoisie's various fallacies that looked down on workers.

There was a very powerful piece of criticism: the day after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, Huangpu Port accepted a transfer task that was urgent, had a large volume, and had strict requirements. At that time, the original production command organization had not yet been reorganized, and the Revolutionary Committee handed this task over to the workers, who formed a command group. They completely abolished the original set of cumbersome rules and regulations, discarded the practice of commanding production from the office through telephones and reports, and moved the command group to the production site. They studied Chairman Mao's works with the workers, discussed work with them, and solved production problems together. Because they could rely closely on the broad masses of workers, they could solve many problems that were thought to be solvable only by "authorities" and "experts." Formulating the loading plan chart is a relatively complex task that requires mastering various aspects of knowledge, such as the characteristics, area, weight, and distance of various goods, as well as the technical performance of various ships, to reasonably load tens of millions of tons of goods, ensuring the safety of goods and ships. In the past, this task was considered very mysterious, and only a few professional personnel in the production dispatching room could do it. Workers were not allowed to touch it. This time, the workers set aside the production dispatching room and formulated the loading plans for many large ships themselves, completing the transfer task quickly and excellently, ahead of schedule, and with high-quality standards. This fully demonstrated the wisdom and strength of the working class.

In the face of such irrefutable facts, the lies such as "bamboo pole carriers are incompetent" were completely exposed. Batch after batch of outstanding workers continuously filled various levels of production command and technical departments. Now, more than 80% of the personnel working in various levels of leadership positions in the entire port are workers and cadres promoted from among the workers.

Who Says Feathers Can't Fly to the Sky?

After workers continuously entered the production technology departments, some people spread cold winds, saying: workers have low cultural levels. Although they can organize and command production well through many years of production practice, they may not be able to achieve much in scientific technology.

The Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, pointed out sternly: the argument that emphasizes cultural level one-sidedly and does not believe that the masses of workers can be the masters of science and technology, just fits the needs of the bourgeoisie. Before the Cultural Revolution, capitalist-roaders and bourgeois "technical authorities" always used the excuse of workers' low cultural level to prevent workers from contacting more complex technologies. The masses of workers' inventions and creations in technology were also subjected to suppression and attacks from all sides. The experience of worker Xu Yang, known as a pioneer of technological innovation, in trying to manufacture a "planer," is a typical example. Xu Yang, who had never attended school, proposed dozens of rationalization suggestions and more than ten major tool reforms since 1955. The drawings he painstakingly drew were suppressed and burned as waste paper by capitalist-roaders and bourgeois "technical authorities." He proposed to manufacture a device called a "planer" for loading and unloading machinery very early, but the capitalist-roaders did not provide the materials for the trial, and it could not be done until these capitalist-roaders and bourgeois "technical authorities" were overthrown. This year, he finally succeeded in manufacturing the "planer."

Xu Yang's experience clearly shows that whether the working class can reach the peak of production technology depends not on the level of cultural education but on whether the power of production technology is truly in the hands of the working class.

At Huangpu Port, some so-called "difficult" production technology problems that professional engineering and technical personnel had been unable to solve for a long time were easily solved by workers. The transportation channels at the Huangpu Port dock are crisscrossed, with eight railway tracks and many vehicle lanes, and 21 intersections. In the past, important intersections were each assigned a worker to direct vehicles day and night. On foggy days, the signal flags were not visible, and vehicle collisions often occurred. Those so-called "engineering and technical experts" studied for five years and could not find a solution. After the Cultural Revolution, the workers solved it themselves. Someone said: "Even if engineers use several advanced scientific principles, they can't solve it. You can solve it, so feathers can fly to the sky!" The workers did not listen to this and did not delve into any advanced scientific principles. They were inspired by the method of traffic police in Guangzhou City directing vehicles and, in a few months, successfully created an electric intersection director, directing through bells and red and green lights. Fourteen workers replaced the original 63 workers' labor and eliminated accidents caused by intersection directing errors.

As the working class gradually seized back the power of production technology, the masses of workers increasingly demonstrated their boundless creativity. The "ventilation equipment for anchorage loading and unloading operations" that the masses of workers successfully developed in July this year is rare in ports around the world. For many years, workers in the 30-40 meter deep holds of 10,000-ton ships loaded and unloaded goods, with temperatures reaching over 40 degrees Celsius in the summer. Workers laboring in the deep holds were soaked in sweat all day, often experiencing heatstroke and fainting. In the past, workers had repeatedly requested to solve this problem, but it was rejected by capitalist-roaders and bourgeois "technical authorities." After the working class seized the power of production technology, four illiterate dock workers combined with a technician who graduated from a secondary technical school, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, overcame numerous difficulties and finally created a ventilation device suitable for anchorage loading and unloading operations, sending cool air to the bottom of the hold for the first time. Many foreign sailors, seeing the ventilation device created by the loading and unloading workers, sighed deeply, "Capitalists do not treat porters as human beings. We have traveled all over the world's ports and have never seen such a device. The porters led by Chairman Mao are truly intelligent and happy!"

    毛主席领导的工人阶级最有才能
    黄埔港广大工人群众掌握领导权以后，组织、指挥整个装卸工作，既严密、协调，又迅速，出色地完成任务
    在无产阶级文化大革命夺取全面胜利的时刻，我国南方最大的港口黄埔港，显得格外繁忙。几十艘轮船停泊在港内，昼夜不停地吞吐着千万吨货物。
    一艘万吨级的外国商轮，正在码头卸货。五部三四十米高的龙门吊车，四部巨型卷扬机一齐开动，成吨的货物从九个舱口吐出来，通过火车、汽车、驳船运送出港。在码头上，成百上千的工人，正以工人阶级当家做主的豪迈气概，紧张地劳动着。整个装卸工作组织得这样严密、协调，装卸作业进行得这样迅速，连这艘外轮的船长也不得不连声赞叹：“毛泽东时代的中国工人真了不起！”而组织和指挥这一切的，不是什么“专家”，也不是什么“权威”，而是在黄埔港扛了十多年竹杠的普通装卸工人。
    这样的事，过去在黄埔港是从来没有过的。只是在广大工人群众不仅掌握了政治上的领导权，而且把生产技术大权牢牢地掌握在自己的手里以后，工人阶级才充分显示了自己无穷的力量和奇异的才能。
    生产技术大权非夺不可
    在黄埔港，工人阶级掌握生产技术大权，是经历了一场激烈的阶级斗争的。
    今年七月，正在黄埔港革命委员会成立前后，全港生产出现下降现象，各种事故有所增加。革命委员会成立前不久，一艘外国商轮一定要在三天内把货装完，不然就要退货、罚款。当时，窃踞生产办公室领导职务的走资派故意拖延时间，制造矛盾，企图给国内外阶级敌人提供攻击无产阶级文化大革命的反动口实。广大工人群众及时识破了敌人的阴谋，揪出了这个走资派，把装载这船货物的指挥权夺了过来，经过两天两夜的奋战，终于提前一天完成了装载任务，粉碎了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋。
    革命委员会成立以后，阶级敌人继续利用他们仍然把持着的部分生产指挥和技术大权，破坏生产，向工人阶级进攻。他们摆出了一副“专家”、“权威”的架势，把某些专业技术说得神乎其神，欺负工人群众，以任意摆弄在港装卸的轮船，使我们的人力得不到合理使用，装卸机械不能充分发挥作用，企图拆新生红色政权的台。
    革命委员会面对这些情况，组织广大工人反复学习了毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导。伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”大家深刻地认识到：阶级敌人利用控制在他们手里的部分生产技术大权，利用还未肃清的修正主义在思想和制度上的种种流毒来
  “整”我们，这是阶级斗争的继续。大家深深感到：革命委员会成立以后，工人阶级不仅要在政治上掌权，还必须彻底夺回生产的大权，才能巩固工人阶级的领导，才能完成“抓革命，促生产”的伟大任务。
    认识统一了，革命委员会就率领广大工人群众，向暗藏的阶级敌人展开了猛烈的进攻。一个控制着全港生产指挥机构的走资派，被工人群众揪了出来，革命委员会立即改组了这个生产指挥机构。紧接着，深埋在各个生产单位和技术部门的阶级敌人，也陆续被工人群众挖了出来。被这些坏家伙窃踞的生产指挥和技术部门的领导权陆续被夺了回来。
    工人阶级真正当家作主，广大工人扬眉吐气，黄埔港的面貌焕然一新，生产直线上升。八月份虽然抽出了一大批工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队和其它工作，港口吞吐量仍然比七月份增加了百分之五十一，九月份又继续增加到百分之六十六。
    “扛竹杠的”最有才能
    在狠挖阶级敌人的同时，黄埔港革委会不断从工人中选拔生产技术干部。这些被选拔的工人，大都文化水平不高，不少人根本没有入过学。有些人怀疑：他们能够把生产组织好，指挥好吗？能够把复杂的技术掌握起来吗？
    这些疑虑是有很深的阶级根源的。多少年来，走资派为了垄断生产技术大权，推行修正主义路线，一方面，把资产阶级的“专家”、“权威”捧上“宝座”，把国民党残渣余孽也网罗进来，吓唬工人说：“没有这些专家、内行，社会主义就建不成。”另方面，又设下重重障碍，压制工人学习生产技术，使他们不能发挥组织指挥生产的才能。他们恶毒地污蔑码头工人是“空心竹杠”，“扛竹杠的无能人”。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”革命委员会以毛主席这一最新指示为武器，发动广大工人群众，彻底批判了资产阶级轻视工人的种种谬论。
    有一件极其有力的批判材料：革命委员会成立后的第二天，黄埔港接受了一项时间紧、运量大、要求严的转运任务。那时，原来的生产指挥机构还未改组，革命委员会就把这个任务交给工人，由工人组成了指挥小组。他们彻底废除了原来的一套繁琐的规章制度，抛弃了坐在办公室通过电话和表报来指挥生产的作风，把指挥小组搬到生产现场，同工人们一块学习毛主席著作，一块商量工作，一块解决生产中的问题。由于他们能紧紧依靠广大工人群众，他们就能解决许多被认为只有“权威”、“专家”才能解决的问题。制定配载计划图是一项比较复杂的工作，需要掌握各种货物的特性、面积、重量以及运途远近、各种轮船的技术性能等等多方面的知识，才能把千万吨货物配载得合理，保证货物无损和船只安全。过去，这件工作被看得十分神秘，只有生产调度室几个专业人员才能做，工人是沾不上手的。这次，工人把生产调度室抛开，自己制定了好多艘大轮船的配载计划，搞得又快又出色，提前完成了转运任务，质量达到高标准，充分显示了工人阶级的智慧和力量。
    在雄辩的事实面前，“扛竹杠的无能人”这类鬼话彻底破了产。成批的优秀工人不断充实到各级生产指挥和技术部门。现在，在全港各级领导岗位工作的人员，工人和由工人提拔的干部占了百分之八十以上。
    谁说鸡毛不能上天
    工人不断进入生产技术部门后，有人放冷风说：工人文化水平低，凭着多年的生产实践，组织指挥生产还好办，在科学技术上，就不一定能搞出什么名堂。
    革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，严肃地指出：片面强调文化水平，不相信工人群众能当科学技术的主人的论调，正好适应资产阶级的需要。在文化大革命以前，走资派和资产阶级“技术权威”总是借口工人文化水平低，不让工人接触比较复杂的技术，工人群众在技术上的发明创造，更是遭到多方压制和打击。被称为技术革新闯将的工人许扬试制“刮刨机”的经历，就是一个典型的例子。许扬从一九五五年以来，提出过几十种合理化建议，十多项大型的工具改革。他这个没有进过学校门的工人，千辛万苦画出来的图纸，却被走资派和资产阶级“技术权威”扣压起来，当废纸烧掉了。他很早就提出要试制一种名叫“刮刨机”的装卸机械，但走资派不给试制材料，一直搞不成，直到这些走资派和资产阶级“技术权威”垮了台，他的愿望才能实现。今年，他终于把“刮刨机”试制成功。
    许扬的经历清楚地表明，工人阶级能不能在生产技术上攀登高峰，决定的因素不是文化水平的高低，而是生产技术大权是不是真正掌握在工人阶级手里。
    在黄埔港，有些所谓“老大难”的生产技术问题，专门的工程技术人员长期解决不了，交给工人就迎刃而解。黄埔港码头运输通道纵横交错，有八股火车轨道和许多汽车通道，二十一个交叉道口。过去，重要的道口都派上一个工人，昼夜站在道口指挥车辆，遇上大雾天气，指挥手旗看不清，撞车事故常有发生。那些所谓“工程技术专家”研究了五年，也没有解决的办法。文化大革命以后，工人就自己动手解决。有人说：
  “人家工程师用了几种尖端科学原理都没有解决，你们能解决，鸡毛也能飞上天了！”工人们不听这一套，也没有去钻什么尖端科学原理，他们从广州市交通岗警指挥车辆的办法得到启发，几个月的工夫，便成功地创造了一种电动的道口指挥器，通过电铃和红绿灯进行指挥，十四个工人代替了原先要六十三个工人的劳动，并且消灭了由于道口指挥的差错而出现的事故。
    随着工人阶级逐步夺回生产技术大权，工人群众日益显示出无穷的创造力。工人群众在今年七月搞成功的“锚地装卸作业通风设备”，在世界各国港口都是少见的。多少年来，工人在万吨轮船上三四十米的深舱里装卸货物，夏天的温度高达摄氏四十度以上。在深舱里劳动的工人，整天浸在汗水里，常常发生中暑、晕倒等现象。过去，工人多次要求解决这个问题，都被走资派和资产阶级“技术权威”否定了。工人阶级掌握了生产技术大权以后，四个不识字的装卸工人同一个中等专业学校毕业的技术员相结合，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，克服了重重困难，终于创造了一种可以适用于锚地装卸作业的通风设备，第一次把凉风送到舱底。许多外国海员看到装卸工人自己创造的这种通风设备，深有感慨地说：“资本家是不把搬运工人当人的。我们跑遍全世界的港口，都没有见过这种设备。毛主席领导的搬运工人，真聪明，真幸福！”
