The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Those educated in old schools, the majority or a large majority, are able to unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line, receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers."

Liu Tingyin, an assistant technician at the Chengde Sericulture Research Institute in Hebei Province, is an intellectual who has successfully united with workers and peasants, made inventions and creations, and is welcomed by workers and peasants. Since graduating from a secondary specialized school, he has insisted on following the path of uniting with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao. Through participating in collective production labor, he has received re-education from workers and peasants, continuously transformed his thoughts, and successfully bred a new variety of castor silkworms that can hibernate and overwinter.

The success of this research solved a problem that had not been solved in this field of science both domestically and internationally, opening up a broad prospect for the development of castor silkworm production in our country. Currently, twenty-six provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have obtained this new product from the Chengde Sericulture Research Institute, and it is being popularized in rural areas nationwide for production. From now on, castor silkworms, which could only be raised in large numbers in the tropics, have settled in the colder northern regions; the fallacy that "castor silkworms cannot hibernate and overwinter" propagated by bourgeois "authorities" has been thoroughly shattered. This is a victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the fruit of intellectuals uniting with workers and peasants.

The transformation of worldview is the fundamental transformation

From 1961, Liu Tingyin began his experiments on castor silkworm hibernation and overwintering, experiencing three years of failure and one year of success. In the first three years, he brought in more than ten thousand silkworm eggs for the experiment. Although the silkworms endured the winter, most lost their reproductive ability. The first year yielded only about five hundred small silkworms, and by 1963, this number had decreased to seventy-two. The severe failures made him reflect on the path he had taken and find the root cause of the failures.

Liu Tingyin comes from a working-class family. However, in the old school, under the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, bourgeois intellectuals instilled in him ideas of "studying to become an official" and personal fame and gain. When he was assigned to work at a research institute upon graduation, he was secretly pleased, thinking, "Good, promotions are quick in research institutes!"

Liu Tingyin's proposal to conduct experiments on castor silkworm hibernation and overwintering was his own initiative. At that time, he worked in the countryside and discovered that the local area had many castor plants. He thought that developing castor silkworms was a labor-saving, high-income sideline production that would benefit the consolidation of the collective economy of people's communes and the development of the entire socialist economy. His proposal to conduct experiments had a good mainstream of thought, but it also contained elements of individualism, hoping that if the experiment succeeded, his wish for a quick promotion could be realized.

Chairman Mao said: "Intellectuals, before they unite with the revolutionary struggles of the masses and before they decide to serve the interests of the masses and unite with them, often have tendencies of subjectivism and individualism. Their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often wavering." Liu Tingyin, with the problem of repeated experimental failures, studied Chairman Mao's great teachings and felt deeply moved. He thought: I am carrying the "self" to make a revolution, always thinking about quick promotions, not serving the interests of the masses, this is purely a bourgeois worldview. It is under the guidance of this worldview that I go from book to book, from laboratory to laboratory, alienating myself from the masses and from reality. Liu Tingyin began to realize: to serve the public or the self, to unite with workers and peasants or to alienate from them, this is a struggle between two worldviews and two paths. If this problem is not correctly solved, the socialist revolution cannot be passed, and there will be no achievements in work. He decided to go to the masses of workers and peasants, to follow the path of uniting with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao.

Only by uniting with workers and peasants can one achieve something

The experiment began anew. Liu Tingyin moved his workplace from the laboratory to the silkworm room, put down his airs, worked, discussed, and experimented with the workers, and learned from them. He participated in leaf picking, silkworm feeding, cocoon mounting, and cocoon making without interruption. He raised summer silkworms and autumn silkworms, working day and night, observing the habits of silkworms, investigating the current situation and history of castor silkworms, and exploring the key to overwintering.

The habit of castor silkworms not hibernating is formed in the tropics, and it is suitable for living in the tropics. How can it be made to hibernate and overwinter, suitable for living in temperate zones? Liu Tingyin opened "On Contradiction." Chairman Mao said: "The internal contradictions of things are the fundamental cause of the development of things, and the mutual connection and mutual influence between one thing and another thing are the secondary cause of the development of things." Chairman Mao's teachings enlightened Liu Tingyin. He decided to find the contradictions affecting overwintering within the castor silkworm itself, create the conditions for overwintering, and make the castor silkworm change from not hibernating to hibernating. To solve this problem, he extensively contacted the masses and objective practice. He consulted the workers in the institute and also visited nearby production teams to ask old farmers. With the enthusiastic help of the masses of workers and peasants, after multiple experiments and research, he finally succeeded in making castor silkworms able to hibernate and overwinter while maintaining normal reproductive ability.

During the experiment, Liu Tingyin deeply felt the wisdom of the masses of workers and peasants. For example, to create an autumn environment for castor silkworms, they set up the experimental room in a cave about thirty meters deep with a relatively low temperature and controlled the temperature to around seventeen degrees. How to control it? This problem was solved by female worker Gao Zhishu. The method is: hang a curtain at the entrance and in the middle to separate and control the temperature. To solve the problem of people frequently entering and exiting the cave during the experiment, causing the outside hot air to flow into the cave and increase the temperature, Gao Zhishu proposed lifting a corner of the inner curtain to maintain a small gap, allowing an appropriate amount of cold air to enter. In this way, the cold and hot air cancel each other out, and the normal temperature can be maintained. This method is excellent! It doesn't cost money, it doesn't use electricity, and the temperature control requirement is perfectly realized. Liu Tingyin excitedly said, only workers and peasants can think of such good methods.

Unite with workers and peasants to defend the proletarian scientific research line

During the research on castor silkworm hibernation and overwintering, Liu Tingyin resolutely walked out of the research room, united with the masses of workers and peasants, and bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian scientific research line, fighting against the revisionist scientific research line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the bourgeois "authorities."

In 1961, when Liu Tingyin's experiment just began, he was fiercely opposed by those bourgeois "authorities" who controlled the sericulture scientific front. They said nonsense like "no degree, no topic design," "no equipment, no scientific research."

In the face of those "giants," Liu Tingyin thought of Chairman Mao's teaching, "We are doing a very glorious and great business that our predecessors have never done," and heard the encouragement and support of the masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary cadres in the institute, his confidence soared, and he decided to bravely and firmly carry on, completing the task in unity with workers and peasants.

Liu Tingyin and his team conducted the experiment with only two rooms, a few silkworm trays, and a few kerosene lamps as equipment. According to the bourgeois "equipment-only" theory, conducting scientific research on castor silkworm overwintering without electric refrigerators, temperature and light control instruments, and a full set of foreign equipment is impossible and not allowed. Liu Tingyin repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created," humbly consulted the masses of workers and peasants, and personally designed and manufactured. Without a light control instrument, Liu Tingyin and the workers together researched and manufactured a special small wooden box, which was even more convenient to use than foreign equipment. Their revolutionary spirit infuriated the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," who cursed Liu Tingyin as "acting recklessly." Liu Tingyin and the workers and technicians participating in the experiment said proudly, "We are determined to create a bright red new world under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao."

Once, a "special envoy" from the provincial agricultural scientific research unit came to the Chengde Sericulture Research Institute to inspect work and strongly opposed the castor silkworm hibernation and overwintering experiment. Liu Tingyin fearlessly removed the interference and stood straight, continuing the work. The capitalist roaders in the institute also set up numerous obstacles, trying to sabotage and destroy the castor silkworm overwintering experiment. He even used malicious methods such as not providing feed and not allowing castor planting to try to make the experiment fail. This further enraged Liu Tingyin and the workers, who fought back while continuing the experiment in their spare time, planting castor along the ditches and roads.

The blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, burned in the Chengde Sericulture Research Institute. Liu Tingyin, together with the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, dragged out the capitalist roaders in the institute and thoroughly exposed and criticized them.

From 1964 to 1968, Liu Tingyin successively attended several national castor silkworm academic research and production conferences held in Zhanjiang, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Zhenjiang. At these conferences, Liu Tingyin, this unknown "little person," with his rich achievements and fighting practices gained from actively applying Mao Zedong Thought and uniting with the masses of workers and peasants, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific research line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and made contributions to implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian scientific research line.

Liu Tingyin deeply felt: "Conducting scientific experiments also involves the struggle between two classes and two lines. In such political struggles, only by uniting with the masses of workers and peasants and relying on them can one achieve victory. Only by raising it to this height can one truly understand the great significance of uniting with the masses of workers and peasants."

Insist on receiving re-education from workers and peasants in labor

After the success of the castor silkworm hibernation and overwintering experiment, Liu Tingyin attached great importance to the promotion work. He said, "The success of the experiment is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand miles. It is only when it is promoted and accepted by the masses of farmers and used in production development that the purpose of the experiment is achieved."

This year, as soon as spring arrived, Liu Tingyin walked out of the research institute, went to the Hengshui area to stay, learned the revolutionary spirit of the local workers and peasants, and cultivated and promoted the new variety of castor silkworms that can overwinter. Liu Tingyin went to the countryside, and the first thing he did was to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the poor and lower-middle peasants, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and vigorously promote revolution and production.

The boundless class feelings of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants for the great leader Chairman Mao and vivid examples, the great revolutionary and production situation in the countryside, gave Liu Tingyin great education and encouragement. He relied on the masses of workers and peasants to build simple breeding grounds, cultivated original strains, hybrid strains, green-spotted green-skinned, yellow-spotted yellow-skinned, and other new varieties of castor silkworms suitable for local conditions, and fought for three months, making the whole area self-sufficient in original strains. At the same time, he also promoted new technologies for disease prevention and high yield, such as small silkworm co-feeding, collective greening, dry paper cultivation, large and small silkworm separation, and improving silkworm quality.

In recent years, Liu Tingyin has traveled to many places. He also exchanged experiences with some research and production units inside and outside the province through letters and seminars. When there is a need for help from outside, he enthusiastically supports it. In this way, the new variety of castor silkworms that can overwinter is being widely promoted.

Wherever Liu Tingyin goes, he treats it as his home. He puts down his luggage and works with the community members. Sometimes, he runs dozens of miles a day, visiting three to five places, and works as usual when he arrives. He said: Sweat with the poor and lower-middle peasants, heart with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the thought of serving the people will be more solid.

"Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." The units where Liu Tingyin has worked and the places he has visited, the masses of workers and peasants all welcome him and regard him as one of their own. Workers greet him affectionately as "Old Liu," and poor and lower-middle peasants greet him affectionately as "local expert."

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on intellectuals receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers were issued, Liu Tingyin's determination to follow the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers was even firmer. Liu Tingyin excitedly swore to Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You wave your hand, and I advance. I am determined to follow your proletarian revolutionary line, to hold high your brilliant red flag of thought, to walk the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to temper myself into a revolutionary and laboring intellectual of the proletariat in the three great revolutionary movements, to achieve new merits for the people.

    坚决走毛主席指引的道路
    承德蚕桑研究所助理技术员刘廷印同工农结合研究成功蓖麻蚕休眠越冬
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”
    河北省承德蚕桑研究所助理技术员刘廷印，就是一个同工农结合得好，并有所发明、创造，为工农所欢迎的知识分子。他在中等专业学校毕业以来，坚持走毛主席指引的同工农相结合的道路，在参加集体生产劳动中接受工农的再教育，不断改造思想，培育成功了蓖麻蚕休眠越冬新品种。
    这项研究的成功，解决了国内外这方面科学研究中一直没有解决的一个问题，为发展我国蓖麻蚕生产开辟了广阔前景。现在，全国已经有二十六个省、市、自治区的许多科学研究和生产单位，从承德蚕桑研究所引去这种新产品，正在向广大农村普及，用于生产。从此，只能在热带大量饲养的蓖麻蚕，在气温较低的北方安家落户了；那些资产阶级“权威”老爷们认为
  “蓖麻蚕不能休眠过冬”的谬论，被彻底粉碎了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是知识分子同工农相结合的成果。
    世界观的改造是根本的改造
    刘廷印从一九六一年开始搞蓖麻蚕休眠越冬试验的四年间，经历了三年失败、一年成功的曲折过程。前三年，他引来一万多粒蚕种做试验，蚕虽然熬过了冬天，可是大多数失去了繁殖能力，头一年只出了五百多条小蚕，到一九六三年便减少到七十二条。惨重的失败，使得他不能不回过头来看一看自己所走过的道路，找一找失败的病根在那里。
    刘廷印出身于劳动人民家庭。可是，在旧学校里，在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害下，资产阶级知识分子给他灌输了“读书做官”等个人名利思想。毕业分配的时候，他听说要到研究单位工作，心里暗自高兴，他曾想：“好，研究单位升得快！”
    刘廷印搞蓖麻蚕休眠越冬试验，是他主动提出建议的。那时，他下乡工作，发现当地种蓖麻很多，联想到发展蓖麻蚕是一项用力小、收入大的副业生产，对巩固人民公社集体经济和发展整个社会主义经济有好处。他提出搞试验，思想动机的主流是好的，但也掺杂了个人主义的成分，觉得一旦试验成功，“升得快”的愿望就可以实现了。
    毛主席说：“知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”刘廷印带着试验一再失败的问题，学习了毛主席这一伟大教导，感受格外深切。他想：自己带着“私”字闹革命，一心想“升得快”，不为群众的利益服务，这纯粹是资产阶级的世界观。正是在这种世界观的指导下，自己从书本到书本，从实验室到实验室，脱离了群众，脱离了实际。刘廷印开始觉悟到：为公还是为私，同工农结合还是脱离工农，这是两种世界观、两条道路的斗争。这个问题如果得不到正确解决，社会主义革命这一关过不去，工作中将一事无成。他下决心到工农群众中去，走毛主席指引的同工农相结合的道路。
    只有同工农结合才能有所作为
    试验重新开始了。刘廷印把工作地点由实验室搬到养蚕室，放下架子，与工人同劳动，同商量，同试验，向工人学习。他从采叶、喂蚕到上簇、结茧，不间断地参加劳动。他养了夏蚕养秋蚕，夜以继日地边干、边学、边想，观察蚕的习性，调查研究蓖麻蚕的现状和历史，探索越冬的关键。
    蓖麻蚕不休眠的习性，是在热带形成的，它适合在热带生活。怎样才能让它休眠越冬，适合在温带生活呢？刘廷印翻开了《矛盾论》。毛主席说：“事物内部的这种矛盾性是事物发展的根本原因，一事物和他事物的互相联系和互相影响则是事物发展的第二位的原因。”毛主席的教导使刘廷印开窍了，他决心从蓖麻蚕本身寻找影响越冬的矛盾，创造越冬的条件，让蓖麻蚕发生从不休眠到休眠的变化。为了解决这个问题，他广泛接触群众，接触客观实践。他向所内的工人请教，还跑到邻近的生产队访问老农。在工农群众的热情帮助下，经过多次的试验、研究，终于试验成功了，不但使蓖麻蚕能够休眠越冬，而且可以保持正常的繁殖能力。
    在试验过程中，刘廷印深刻地体会到了工农群众的聪明和智慧。譬如，为了给蓖麻蚕创造一个秋天的环境，他们把实验室设在温度较低的一座三十多米深的山洞里，并要把气温控制在十七度左右。怎么控制呢？这个难题是女工高致淑解决的。办法是：在洞口和中间各挂一个门帘相隔，用以控制温度。为了解决试验中人们经常走进走出，洞外面的热空气流进洞内，使气温增高的问题，高致淑又提出把里边的门帘掀起一角，保持一条小缝，放进适量的冷空气。这样冷热互相抵销，就可以保持正常温度。这个办法好极了！一不花钱，二不用电，控制温度的要求圆满实现。刘廷印激动地说，这样的好办法，只有工人、农民才能想得出。
    同工农一起捍卫无产阶级科研路线
    在研究蓖麻蚕休眠越冬过程中，刘廷印坚决走出研究室，同工农群众结合起来，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级科研路线，同中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义科研路线，同资产阶级“权威”，进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    一九六一年，刘廷印的试验刚刚开始，就遭到了那些把持着蚕业科学阵地的资产阶级“权威”们的疯狂反对，他们胡说什么“没有学位不能设计课题”，“没有仪器设备不能进行科学研究”。
    在那些“庞然大物”的恫吓面前，刘廷印一想起毛主席的“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”的教导，一听到那些工农群众和本所革命干部的鼓励和支持，就信心倍增，决心勇敢地、坚定地搞下去，在同工农结合中完成任务。
    刘廷印他们搞试验，论设备只有两间房子，几个蚕匾，几盏煤油灯。按资产阶级的“唯设备论”那一套，进行蓖麻蚕越冬这类的科学研究，没有电冰箱，没有温度、光照控制器等一整套洋设备，是搞不成的，也根本不允许搞。刘廷印反复学习毛主席“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来”的伟大教导，虚心请教工农群众，自己动手设计、制造。没有光照控制器，刘廷印就和工人一起研究制造了一个特制的小木盒，使用起来比洋设备还好用。他们这种革命的精神，气坏了资产阶级的“专家”、“权威”，他们骂刘廷印“瞎胡闹”。刘廷印和参加试验的工人、技术人员理直气壮地说：“我们就是要在毛主席的英明领导下，闹出个红彤彤的新天地来。”
    一次，从省里的农业科学研究单位来了一个“钦差大臣”，到承德蚕桑研究所检查工作，极力反对蓖麻蚕休眠越冬试验。刘廷印毫不畏惧，排除干扰，挺直腰杆坚持干下去。研究所的走资派也设置重重障碍，竭力阻挠和破坏蓖麻蚕越冬试验。他竟用不给饲料地，不让种蓖麻等恶劣手段，妄想使试验夭折。这更加激怒了刘廷印和工人们，他们一边据理斗争，一边利用业余时间，在沟边道沿抢种蓖麻，坚持试验。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，在承德蚕桑研究所燃烧起来了。刘廷印同广大无产阶级革命派一起，把这个所的走资派揪了出来，并对他进行了彻底的揭发和批判。
    从一九六四年到一九六八年，刘廷印先后出席了在湛江、北京、广州和镇江等地召开的几次全国性蓖麻蚕学术研究和生产会议。在这些会议上，刘廷印这个不出名的“小人物”，以自己活学活用毛泽东思想，同工农群众相结合所获得的丰硕成果和战斗实践，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义科研路线，为贯彻毛主席的无产阶级科研路线做出贡献。
    刘廷印深有体会地说：“搞科学实验，同样贯穿着两个阶级、两条路线的斗争。在这样的政治斗争中，只有同工农群众相结合，依靠工农群众，才能取得胜利。也只有提到这样的高度，才能真正认识与工农群众相结合的伟大意义。”坚持在劳动中接受工农再教育
    蓖麻蚕休眠越冬试验成功以后，刘廷印十分重视推广工作。他说：“试验成功只是万里长征走完了第一步，推广出去，为农民群众所接受，用在发展生产上，才算达到了试验的目的。”
    今年一开春，刘廷印走出研究所，到衡水地区蹲点，学习那里工农群众的革命精神，培育和推广蓖麻蚕越冬新品种。刘廷印到农村，第一件事就是参加毛泽东思想学习班，和贫下中农一起落实毛主席最新指示，一起斗私批修，一起狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    广大贫下中农无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的阶级感情和生动事例，农村革命和生产的大好形势，给了刘廷印极大的教育和鼓舞。他依靠工农群众建起简易养殖场，培育出适合本地情况的原种、杂交种、青点青皮、黄点黄皮等越冬蓖麻蚕新品种，奋战三个月，使全区原种自给有余。同时，还推广了小蚕共养、集体催青、防干纸育、大小蚕分养、提高蚕质等防病高产新技术。
    几年来，刘廷印跑了不少地方。他还通过信件和座谈，与省内外一些研究和生产单位交流经验。遇到外地需要他帮助做些什么，他都热情支持。这样，蓖麻蚕越冬新品种，正在广泛推广。
    刘廷印走到那里，就把那里当作自己的家。他放下行李就同社员们一起干活。有时，他一天要跑几十里路，走上三五个地方，到了那里都照常干活。他说：汗和贫下中农流在一起，心和贫下中农贴在一起，为人民服务的思想也就更牢靠了。
      “这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”刘廷印工作过的单位和走过的地方，工农群众无不欢迎，都把他看作自己人，工人见了亲切地喊他“老刘”，贫下中农见了亲切地叫他“土专家”。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于知识分子要接受工农兵再教育的最新指示发表后，更加坚定了刘廷印走同工农兵相结合的道路的决心。刘廷印激动地向毛主席宣誓：毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家挥手我前进。我坚决在您的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，更高地举起您光辉思想的伟大红旗，走同工农兵结合的道路，在三大革命运动中把自己锻炼成为革命化、劳动化的无产阶级的知识分子，为人民再立新功。
