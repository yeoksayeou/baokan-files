This battle was truly satisfying

    Machine Shop Machining and Electrical Group Liu Yuming

    On the workbench lay two measuring tools: one designed by a bourgeois technical "authority," and the other designed by workers. The on-site criticism meeting began.

    Everyone ordered the person who designed the measuring tool: "Bring over the one you designed!" That person stumbled to the workbench, stammering, "I can't carry it, I... I'll roll it over." This remark was like pouring oil on the fire, further enraging the workers. Everyone fiercely criticized:

    "You can't even carry it yourself, how do you expect workers to use it to measure?"

    "This measuring tool itself weighs seventy-eight pounds, do you know that?"

    "The inspector needs two people to lift it just to move it, it's completely unusable for measuring products. Are these tools designed for people to use, or just for display?"

    The more they criticized, the angrier they got, shouting, "These measuring tools and fixtures are useless once designed. This is all the poison of China's Khrushchev's technical authority and slander against workers in our factory. Look, our factory's capitalist roaders have elevated these reactionary technical 'authorities' to the status of 'Buddha's eyes,' treating workers as mere 'labor tools.' Running a factory like this, it's not just the measuring tools and fixtures that are poorly designed, the entire factory will be led down the wrong path."

    As they criticized, they held up their own designed measuring tools, easily turning them, saying, "In the past, production and inspection were in the hands of a handful of bad elements. Now that workers are in power, the factory's appearance has changed greatly. Just look at our own designed measuring tools, they are ten times better. This fully proves that workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, hardest-working, and bravest. Let China's Khrushchev's fallacies go to hell!"

    In the midst of the heated criticism, a group of bad elements were driven out of the meeting room. The criticism meeting ended in victory. Everyone excitedly said, "In the face of ironclad facts, we not only fought against the bad elements in our factory but also criticized their master, China's Khrushchev, greatly diminishing their arrogance and greatly boosting the morale of the working class. This battle was truly satisfying!"

    这一仗打得真痛快
    机加工车间机电组　刘玉鸣
    工作台上摆着两件量具：一件是资产阶级技术“权威”设计的，一件是工人设计的，现场批判会就开始了。
    大家喝令设计量具的那个家伙：“把你设计的那个量具拿过来！”那个家伙挨到工作台前，张口结舌地说：“我拿不动，我……我把它滚过来吧！”这句话恰象火上浇油，更加惹怒了工人，大家狠狠批判道：
    “你自己拿都拿不动，你叫工人怎么用它去量？”
    “这量具本身净重七十八斤，你知道不知道？”
    “检验工要两个人抬才挪得动，根本没法用它来量产品。你们设计这些东西到底是为了给人用的，还是为了摆着看的？”
    大家越批越气，愤怒地说：“这些量具卡具设计出来，就成为废物。这都是中国赫鲁晓夫技术挂帅、诬蔑工人的反革命谬论在我厂的流毒。看，咱们厂那些走资派把反动技术‘权威’捧成‘佛爷眼珠’，把工人看成‘干活的工具’。这么办厂，别说量具卡具设计不好，整个厂子都要被拉到邪路上去了。”
    大伙一面批判，一面把自己设计的检具拿起来轻巧地转动着说：“过去生产、检验大权都落在一小撮坏人手里。现在工人掌了权，工厂面貌大变样。不看别的，光看咱自己设计的检具，就强十倍。这充分说明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人最聪明、最勤劳、最勇敢。让中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论见鬼去吧！”
    在群情激愤之下，一伙坏蛋被赶出会场，批判会胜利结束。大伙兴奋地说：“在铁的事实面前，既斗了咱厂的坏蛋，又批了他们的祖师爷中国赫鲁晓夫，大灭了他们的威风，大长了咱工人阶级的志气，这一仗打得真痛快！”
