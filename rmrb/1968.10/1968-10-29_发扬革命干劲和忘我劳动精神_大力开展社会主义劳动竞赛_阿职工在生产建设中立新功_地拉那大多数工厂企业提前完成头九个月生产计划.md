The workers of the capital city of Tirana, Albania, under the leadership of the Party organizations at various levels, have carried forward revolutionary enthusiasm and selfless labor spirit, vigorously launched socialist labor competition, and achieved remarkable results in production and construction in the first three quarters of this year.

By the end of September, most factories and enterprises in Tirana had already completed their production plans for the first nine months ahead of schedule. The industrial production from January to September completed 106.8% of the original plan, with a production value exceeding the original plan by 62.7 million leks. The construction industry completed 104% of the original plan. Commerce completed 102.8% of the original plan. Some factories and enterprises have already completed the 1968 production plan ahead of schedule. Currently, many factories are striving to complete this year's production tasks ahead of schedule and in excess of the plan.

While striving to complete the national plan, the broad masses of workers in the capital have actively responded to the call of the Third Plenum of the Party of Labor of Albania to launch a technological revolution, mobilized the collective wisdom, and launched a mass movement of technological innovation and rationalization proposals. In the first nine months of this year, workers submitted a total of 3,450 rationalization proposals, of which 1,860 have been implemented. During the same period, the broad masses of workers, relying on their own strength, tapped internal potentials, and built 60 new workshops and production lines, greatly increasing the variety of products and improving labor productivity.

In production and construction, workers also considered the issue of thrift from a political perspective. They used their brains, found ways, and saved money for the state. In just the first half of this year, they saved 16.78 million leks for the state. The workers of the Tirana Brick and Tile Factory, through collective wisdom, saved 660,000 leks from January to September this year. During the same period, the workers of the Joseph Pashko Building Materials Combine saved 2.3 million leks for the state.

At the same time, workers have made unremitting efforts to improve labor productivity. The Stalin Textile Combine now has 316 workers who have reached the 1970 production plan targets, of which more than 70 workers have exceeded the 1970 production targets. The workers of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory and the Pharmaceutical Factory are also working selflessly to fulfill their own pledges.

    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那广大职工，在劳动党各级组织的领导下，发扬革命干劲和忘我劳动精神，大力开展社会主义劳动竞赛，在今年前三个季度的生产和建设中取得了显著的成就。
    九月底以前，地拉那大多数工厂企业都已提前完成头九个月的生产计划。一月至九月的工业生产完成原订计划的百分之一百零六点八，产值超过原计划六千二百七十万里克。建筑业完成了原订计划的百分之一百零四。商业完成了原订计划的百分之一百零二点八。一些工厂企业已经提前完成了一九六八年的生产计划。目前，许多工厂正在为提前和超额完成今年的生产任务而奋斗。
    首都的广大职工在为完成国家计划而努力的同时，积极响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党三中全会关于开展科技革命的号召，发挥集体的智慧，开展群众性的技术革新和合理化建议运动。今年头九个月，职工们共提出了三千四百五十项合理化建议，其中一千八百六十项已经付诸实现。同一期间，广大职工依靠自己的力量，挖掘内部潜力，共新建了六十个车间和作业线，大大增加了产品的品种，提高了劳动生产率。
    在生产和建设中，职工们还从政治上考虑厉行节约问题，他们动脑筋，想办法，为国家节约资金。仅今年上半年，他们就为国家节约了一千六百七十八万里克。地拉那砖瓦厂职工群策群力，从今年一月到九月共节约了六十六万里克。同一期间，约瑟夫·帕希科建筑材料联合企业的职工为国家节约了二百三十万里克。
    与此同时，职工们为提高劳动生产率进行了不断的努力。斯大林纺织联合工厂现在已经有三百一十六名工人达到了一九七○年的生产计划指标，其中七十多名工人还超过了一九七○年的生产指标。地拉那拖拉机配件厂和制药厂等工厂的职工也正在为实现自己的保证而忘我劳动。
