The recent annual conference of the British Labour Party, a tool of the British monopolistic bourgeoisie, reflects the decaying British imperialism mired in political and economic crises with no way out. The Labour Party government's reactionary economic policies, which further exploit the working people, have not only met with strong opposition from the broad masses of workers but have also intensified contradictions and disputes within the Labour Party itself.

The conference was held from September 30 to October 4 in Blackpool. Despite the efforts of Prime Minister Wilson and other ministers to defend the Labour Party government's continuously failing domestic and foreign policies, they could not conceal the despair and fear of the British ruling class over the worsening financial and economic crisis. Local bourgeois newspapers admitted that "this conference was held in an atmosphere more dispirited and lacking in confidence than at any time since the war."

Since coming to power in October 1964, the Labour Party government has actively defended the interests of the British monopolistic bourgeoisie, intensifying its attacks on the working people in an attempt to save British imperialism from its death throes. However, it has been proven that in the four years since the Labour Party took office, Britain's financial and economic crisis has worsened dramatically. In particular, the devaluation of the pound last November did not, as the Labour Party had hoped, improve Britain's foreign trade and balance of payments, but instead increased the country's foreign trade and balance of payments deficits. The foreign trade deficit for the first eight months of this year was nearly double that of the first three quarters of last year, while the balance of payments deficit for the first half of this year was close to the deficit for the entire year of 1967, and even larger than the combined deficits of 1965 and 1966. Britain's borrowing from other capitalist countries has also increased. Faced with this situation, the Labour Party government has intensified its attacks on the British working class and the broad masses of workers in recent years, attempting to shift the heavy burden of the financial and economic crisis onto the working class. It not only promotes capital concentration, merges factories, and increases unemployment, but also freezes or restricts the wages of employed workers, raises various taxes and prices, and lowers the living standards of workers to maintain the huge profits of monopolistic capital. However, the Labour Party government's reactionary policies have met with fierce resistance from the British working class, further intensifying contradictions and disputes within the Labour Party.

It is under these circumstances that the Labour Party government's leaders, including Wilson, have tried to use this Labour Party conference to push their reactionary economic policies. However, even at this conference, many representatives, under pressure from the broad masses of workers, raised objections to the government's reactionary economic policies. The Labour Party's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jenkins, raved about "austerity" and "hard work" at the conference, openly demanding that the British people tighten their belts and work for the monopolistic bourgeoisie. At the same time, they had to admit that the British capitalist economy, which is in a critical condition, is deteriorating rapidly.

It is particularly worth noting that during this conference, dozens of miners' representatives, carrying placards, rushed into the venue to demonstrate, protesting against the Labour Party government's mass closure of mines, which forces tens of thousands of miners to become unemployed each year. This unprecedented event shows that the resistance of the British working people against the British ruling class is becoming increasingly strong, and they are increasingly seeing through the true face of the British Labour Party as a tool of the British monopolistic bourgeoisie.

    危机深重　政策破产　人民反对　内讧加剧
    英国工党年会反映英帝腐朽没落
    西方报纸哀叹这次会议是在“令人垂头丧气和缺乏信心气氛中举行的”
    新华社伦敦电　英国垄断资产阶级的工具——英国执政党工党最近举行的年会，反映了腐朽的英帝国主义正深陷在政治经济危机中无法自拔；英国工党政府变本加厉压榨劳动人民的反动经济政策，不仅遭到广大劳动人民的强烈反对，也在工党内部引起了更大的矛盾和争吵。
    这次年会从九月三十日到十月四日在布拉克浦尔举行。尽管工党政府首相威尔逊和各部大臣在会上竭力为工党政府内外政策的不断破产进行辩解，但是他们却无法掩饰英国统治集团对于英国财政经济危机的急趋恶化所表露的沮丧和惶恐心情。这里的资产阶级报纸承认，“这次会议是在一种比战后任何时候都令人垂头丧气和缺乏信心的气氛中举行的。”
    英国工党政府自从一九六四年十月上台以来，积极维护英国垄断资产阶级的利益，加紧向劳动人民进攻，妄图挽救英帝国主义的垂死命运。但是，事实证明，工党执政四年来，英国的财政经济危机更加急剧恶化。特别是去年十一月英镑的贬值，不仅没有象工党所希望的那样改善英国的对外贸易和国际收支状况，反而使英国的外贸和国际收支的赤字大大增加。今年头八个月的外贸赤字比去年头三个季度的水平高出将近两倍，而今年上半年国际收支赤字则接近了去年全年的赤字额，比一九六五年和一九六六年两年国际收支赤字的总和还要大。英国向其他资本主义国家借债也越来越多。面临这种情况，工党政府近年来加紧向英国工人阶级和广大劳动人民开刀，企图把财政经济危机的沉重负担转嫁给工人阶级。它不仅大搞资本集中，并厂裁员，增加失业人数，而且还冻结或限制在业工人的工资，提高各种捐税和物价，压低工人的实际生活水平，以维持垄断资本的巨额利润。但是，工党政府的这种倒行逆施遭到英国工人阶级的猛烈反击，并加剧了工党内部的矛盾和争吵。
    正是在这种情况下，工党政府的头目威尔逊等竭力想利用这次工党年会，来推行他们的反动经济政策。但是，就在这次会议上，许多代表在广大工人的压力下，对政府的反动经济政策纷纷提出了异议。工党政府的财政大臣詹金斯在会上疯狂叫嚷什么“厉行节约”，“艰苦工作”等等，公然要英国人民勒紧裤带，为垄断资产阶级卖命。与此同时，他们也不得不承认，病入膏肓的英国资本主义经济正在急剧恶化。
    特别值得指出的是，当这届年会正在举行时，几十名矿工代表挥舞着标语牌，冲入会场举行示威，抗议工党政府大批关闭矿井，每年使数万名矿工流离失所。这一前所未有的事件，表明了英国劳动人民对英国统治集团的反抗情绪正越来越强烈，他们正在日益识破英国工党充当英国垄断资产阶级工具的真面目。
