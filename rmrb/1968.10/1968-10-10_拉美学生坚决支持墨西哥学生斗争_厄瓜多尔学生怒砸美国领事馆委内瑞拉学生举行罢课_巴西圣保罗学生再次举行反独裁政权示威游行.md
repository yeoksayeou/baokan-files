Latin American students are resolutely supporting the Mexican student struggle. Ecuadorian students angrily smashed the U.S. consulate, and Venezuelan students held a strike. Students in São Paulo, Brazil, once again held a demonstration against the dictatorship.

	Ecuadorian and Venezuelan students recently held demonstrations and strikes to support the Mexican students' just struggle against persecution and massacre.

	In the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil, hundreds of students held a demonstration on the 3rd to support the Mexican students' struggle. The demonstrators angrily threw stones at the U.S. and Mexican consulates, smashed the U.S.-Ecuador Center, the Electricity Company, and the Shell Oil Company, and threw Molotov cocktails at the garage of the U.S. consulate officials. Police brutally used tear gas to suppress the students, but the students bravely resisted the police's violence.

	In Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, about 250 university students held a demonstration on the 8th, condemning the Mexican authorities for sending reactionary troops to brutally suppress the students. In Maracaibo and Mérida, the second and third largest cities in Venezuela, university students also held strikes to support the Mexican students' just struggle against persecution and massacre.

	Students in São Paulo, Brazil's largest industrial city, numbering over a thousand, held another demonstration against the pro-American dictatorship with the help of workers on the 8th. The demonstrators strongly protested the dictatorship's suppression of the student movement, opposed the reactionary education policy, and demanded an increase in workers' wages.

	This demonstration was the fourth anti-dictatorship demonstration in São Paulo in the days following the visit of Brazil's dictator Costa e Silva to the city. In the previous demonstration, a student was brutally killed by reactionary military police.

	Upon learning of the students' demonstration, the reactionary authorities immediately dispatched a large number of police, cavalry, and army units, supported by helicopters and armored vehicles, to brutally suppress the demonstrators in an attempt to disperse the students' ranks. However, the students were undeterred and held demonstrations in various commercial districts, engaging in fierce battles with the reactionary military police. The battle continued from the afternoon until the evening, causing traffic in São Paulo to come to a standstill. In this demonstration, more than 20 students were injured, and many were arrested.

    新华社九日讯　厄瓜多尔和委内瑞拉的学生最近举行游行示威和罢课，声援墨西哥学生反迫害、反屠杀的正义斗争。
    厄瓜多尔第一大城市瓜亚基尔数百名学生三日为声援墨西哥学生的斗争，举行游行示威。示威学生愤怒地用石头砸了美国和墨西哥的领事馆，砸了美国—厄瓜多尔中心、电力公司和壳牌石油公司等美国办事机构，并且向美国领事馆官员的汽车房扔燃烧瓶。警察野蛮地使用催泪瓦斯镇压学生，学生们不畏强暴，英勇地抵抗警察的暴行。
    委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯约二百五十名大学生八日举行游行示威，谴责墨西哥当局出动反动军队血腥镇压学生的暴行。在委内瑞拉第二大城市马拉开波和梅里达，大学生也举行了罢课，声援墨西哥学生反迫害、反屠杀的正义斗争。
    新华社九日讯　圣保罗消息：巴西最大工业城市圣保罗的一千多名大、中学生在工人帮助下，八日再次冲上街头举行反对亲美独裁统治的示威游行。示威者强烈抗议独裁当局镇压学生运动，反对反动的教育政策和要求增加工人工资。
    这次示威是圣保罗人民在巴西独裁头子科斯塔—席尔瓦最近去这个城市活动后几天内连续发生的第四次反独裁示威。在前一次示威中，一名学生被反动军警残暴地杀害。
    当反动当局得知学生举行示威的消息后，立即出动大批警察、骑兵和陆军部队，在直升飞机和装甲车的配合下，对示威学生进行残酷的镇压，企图冲散学生的队伍。但是学生们不畏强暴，他们分成许多批在各个闹市区举行示威游行，并且同反动军警展开激烈的搏斗，战斗从下午一直继续到晚上。这次示威使圣保罗市区的交通陷于中断。在这次示威中有二十多名学生受伤，许多人被捕。
