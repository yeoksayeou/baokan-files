The Albanian Party and Government Delegation, led by member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Vice Premier and Minister of Defense of the People's Republic of Albania, Comrade Bekir Balluku, visited the Beijing Knitting Factory on the morning of September 30. They were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary workers of the entire factory and the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed there.

At 9:30 AM that morning, when Comrades Balluku, Marko, Qerqiza, and Theodhori, accompanied by Comrades Chen Yi and Wang Xinting, arrived at the Knitting Factory, over a thousand revolutionary workers lined up on both sides of the road. With deep feelings for the Albanian people, they held high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people and close comrade of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. They waved the national flags of China and Albania, beat drums and gongs, sang and danced, and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with all reactionaries!"

The responsible comrade of the Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee expressed warm greetings to the Albanian comrades on behalf of all the revolutionary workers of the factory.

Subsequently, Comrade Rita Marko, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and First Secretary of the Durres District Party Committee of the Labor Party, delivered an impassioned speech at the mass rally. In his speech, he praised the revolutionary fraternal friendship between the two parties and the peoples of Albania and China. He said, "The great friendship between our two countries is forged according to the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha. We will forever remember the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings: our friendship is eternal and unbreakable."

Comrade Marko said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved tremendous victories. The Chinese workers and soldiers are our brothers. They have well implemented Chairman Mao's directives and decisions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are very happy about this."

Comrade Marko spoke about the revolutionary movement in Albania, saying, "Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, our country is undergoing a great revolution. Now, according to Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings, we are implementing the supervision and leadership of everything by the working class, ensuring that our country always maintains its red color and forever holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism."

Comrade Marko said, "As Chairman Mao said, 'The peoples of China and Albania, though separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, have hearts that are connected.' The telegram from the great leader of the Chinese people, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai, embodies the high international communist spirit of the Communist Party of China towards us and embodies Mao Zedong Thought."

    阿党政代表团参观北京针织总厂
    贵宾们受到革命工人和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队热烈欢迎
    据新华社一日讯　由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，九月三十日上午参观了北京针织总厂，受到全厂革命工人和驻厂中国人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的热烈欢迎。
    当天上午九时三十分，当巴卢库、马尔科、查尔查尼和蒂奥多西等同志，在陈毅同志和王新亭同志的陪同下来到针织总厂的时候，列队在道路两旁的一千多名革命工人，怀着对阿尔巴尼亚人民的深厚感情，高举我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，高举阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大领袖、中国人民的亲密战友恩维尔·霍查同志的画像，挥动中阿两国国旗，敲锣打鼓，载歌载舞，不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国人民的友谊万岁！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒各国反动派！”
    北京针织总厂革命委员会负责人代表全厂革命工人向阿尔巴尼亚同志表示热烈的欢迎。
    接着，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团副主席、劳动党都拉斯区党委第一书记里塔·马尔科同志在群众集会上发表了热情洋溢的讲话。他在讲话中赞扬阿中两党和两国人民革命的战斗友谊。他说，我们阿中两国人民的伟大友谊是依照毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志的教导缔造起来的。我们永远记住党和恩维尔·霍查同志的教导：我们的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。
    马尔科同志说，中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了十分重大的胜利。中国工人、军队是我们的兄弟，他们很好地贯彻毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的教导和决定。我们感到很高兴。
    马尔科同志谈到阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动时说，我们国家在党和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，正在进行一场伟大的革命。现在我们按照恩维尔·霍查同志的教导，实现工人阶级监督一切，工人阶级领导一切，使我们国家永远保持鲜红的颜色，永远高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜。
    马尔科同志说，正如毛主席说的：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”中国人民的伟大领袖、杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席，林彪副主席，周恩来总理给我们的电报，体现了中国共产党对我们的高度的国际共产主义精神，体现了毛泽东思想。
