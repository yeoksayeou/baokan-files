Cadres in Hubei Tractor Factory Shed Their Officialdom Through Labor
The Closer They Work with the Working Class, the Deeper Their Feelings

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 23rd: Cadres in Hubei Tractor Factory who have been sent down to work in production teams have, over the past half year, earnestly learned from the worker masses, promoting the revolutionization of their thinking. Through this period of being sent down to labor, their relationship with the worker masses has become closer, they have gained a real understanding of the excellent qualities of the worker masses, and have developed deep feelings for them. Recently, in summarizing their experiences from the past half year of being sent down to labor, they have expressed that they will further put down their airs, humbly become students of the worker masses, accept the re-education of the worker masses, and stride forward on the great path of combining with the worker and peasant masses as guided by the great leader Chairman Mao.

During the construction and early operation of Hubei Tractor Factory, most cadres carried forward the glorious tradition of the old Eighth Route Army, eating, living, and working with the workers, and even checking the workers' bedding at night. At that time, cadres and workers were closely united, and basic construction and production were carried out quickly and efficiently. However, due to the efforts of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory to promote the revisionist line of factory construction, many cadres were led astray from proletarian politics, away from the worker masses, and away from labor. Cadres occasionally went to the workshops to do "dragonfly skimming" labor, which was to act as "masters," and thus there was always a distance between cadres and the masses.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the directive to "streamline administration and personnel," the factory revolutionary committee broke down the overlapping administrative structures and sent down more than 70% of the cadres to work in the production teams. During the process of being sent down, cadres together with the broad masses of workers, severely criticized the revisionist line of factory construction and the revisionist line of cadre management promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary criticism made cadres further realize that cadres being sent down to labor is to transform their worldview, achieve the revolutionization of cadres and the revolutionization of offices, and ensure that the iron mountain of the proletariat remains unshakable for generations to come.

With the sincere help of the worker masses, many cadres in this factory who have been sent down to labor quickly shed their officialdom. They labor with the workers, sweat with the workers, and think with the workers. The more they labor, the deeper their feelings for the working class, and the more they follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Wang Ming, the director of the Planning Department, had been awarded for his merits year after year in the army and was also a model worker year after year after being transferred to work. However, after being promoted to a cadre, his relationship with the masses became distant. This time, during the sent-down labor, he received good education. Once, while working in the heat treatment team, he forgot to wear protective goggles. When sparks flew from the workpiece, worker Zhang Qingcheng quickly stepped in front of Wang Ming, covering his eyes with his hand, preventing him from being injured. Another time during the night shift, the light bulb on the ceiling of the workshop suddenly went out. Wang Ming was about to find someone to fix it, but the old worker Shang Zuoxu immediately climbed up the more than twenty-meter-high beam, risking his life to hang the light bulb back in place. These two incidents deeply educated Wang Ming. He excitedly said, "The worker comrades always remember Chairman Mao's instructions and act according to them. They are the most loyal to Chairman Mao and follow him the closest. Learning from the worker masses at all times and in all places can temper one's loyalty to Chairman Mao."

Cadres who have been sent down to labor, through labor practice, have developed common thoughts and feelings with the worker masses, and their work has also improved significantly. Technical cadre Luo Yunhai was sent down to work on the drilling of transmission box bodies. The jigs used for drilling positioning weighed over a hundred pounds. When he felt tired lifting the jigs, he always felt ashamed because this heavy jig was designed by him. Now he personally experiences the hardships of drilling work and thinks of how the worker comrades have been completing tasks under such heavy labor conditions for many years, deeply moved, he examined himself for his past mistakes in designing jigs, only considering his own convenience, not considering work efficiency, and not thinking of the worker comrades. Following this, under the guidance and help of old workers, he redesigned a "rotating jig," combining the original sixteen drilling procedures into one, not only making the operation easier but also greatly improving work efficiency.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us, "A large number of cadres being sent down to labor is a good opportunity for them to re-learn. Except for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also be sent down to labor in batches." The factory revolutionary committee, to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, sent down another batch of cadres from those in office to participate in labor and implemented a system of rotating sent-down labor.

### 湖北拖拉机厂下放干部在劳动中打掉了官气  越劳动和工人阶级的感情越深

    湖北拖拉机厂下放干部在劳动中打掉了官气
    越劳动和工人阶级的感情越深
    据新华社武汉二十三日电  湖北拖拉机厂下放到班组的干部，在近半年的劳动实践中认真向工人群众学习，促进了思想的革命化。通过这一阶段的下放劳动，他们同工人群众的关系密切了，对工人群众的优秀品质有了实际的体会，对工人群众有了深厚的感情。他们最近在总结近半年来下放劳动的体会时纷纷表示，要更好地放下架子，甘当工人群众的小学生，接受工人群众的再教育，在伟大领袖毛主席指引的同工农群众相结合的大道上阔步前进。
    湖北拖拉机厂建厂期间和建成初期，多数干部发扬老八路的光荣传统，与工人同吃、同住、同劳动，晚上还给工人查铺盖被。那时，干部与工人亲密无间，基本建设和生产搞得又快又好。可是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在这个厂的代理人极力推行修正主义建厂路线，把广大干部引上了脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工人群众，脱离劳动的邪路。干部偶尔下车间作“蜻蜓点水”式的劳动，是为了当“先生”，因而干部与群众之间总是存在着距离。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“精兵简政”的指示后，厂革委会打破重叠的行政机构，抽出了百分之七十以上的干部下放到班组劳动。在下放过程中，干部们同广大工人一道，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建厂路线和修正主义干部路线。革命的大批判使干部们进一步认识到，干部下放劳动，是为了改造世界观，实现干部革命化和机关革命化，保证无产阶级的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。
    在工人群众的真诚帮助下，这个厂下放劳动的许多干部很快打掉了官气。他们同工人劳动在一起，汗流在一起，心想在一起。越劳动，和工人阶级的感情越深，对毛主席的革命路线跟得越紧。计划科科长王明，过去在部队年年立功受奖，转业当工人后也是年年当模范。可是提拔当干部后，同群众的关系疏远了。这次下放劳动中，他受到了很好的教育。有一次，他在热处理班组劳动时，忘了戴防护眼镜。当工件上火花四溅的时候，工人章青成一个箭步跃到王明的面前，用手遮住他的眼睛，使他没有受伤。还有一次上夜班，车间梁上的灯泡突然不亮了。王明正想找人来修，老工人尚作枢立刻爬上二十多米高的屋梁，冒着危险，把灯泡挂好了。这两件事使王明深受教育。他激动地说：“工人同志们就是时时牢记毛主席的指示，事事照毛主席的指示办事，对毛主席最忠，跟毛主席最紧。随时随地向工人群众学习，就能锤炼自己对毛主席的忠心。”
    下放劳动的干部，通过劳动实践，和工人群众有了共同的思想感情，工作也做得好得多。技术干部罗运海下放搞传动箱体的钻孔工作。为钻孔定位使用的夹具，重的有一百多斤。当他搬夹具感到累的时候，总是感到惭愧，因为这个笨重的夹具就是他设计的。现在他亲自体会到钻孔劳动的艰苦，想到工人同志多年来都是在这样繁重的劳动条件下，千方百计地完成任务，深深受到教育，他向工人检查了以前设计夹具时只图自己方便，不考虑工效，不替工人同志着想的错误。接着，他在老工人的指导和帮助下，新设计出一种“旋转夹具”，把原来钻孔的十六道工序并成一道工序，不仅操作省力，也大大提高了工效。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”厂革委会为了进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，又从在职干部中抽出一批参加劳动，并实行了轮流下放劳动的制度。
