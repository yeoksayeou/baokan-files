The great leader Chairman Mao recently issued instructions: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the highest evaluation of the working class, greatly boosting our morale and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. For a long time, the number one traitor and scoundrel, the Chinese Khrushchev, out of his counterrevolutionary instincts, has been singing the opposite tune to our great leader Chairman Mao, vigorously praising the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, saying that they "understand technology" and are "shrewd and efficient," while maliciously slandering the working class, claiming that we have "no culture," are "stupid" and "ignorant." In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, the working class is just a bunch of "good-for-nothings" and "fools." Bah! This is purely the talk of a bourgeoisie and aristocratic master!

Chinese Khrushchev, listen up: "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has the courage, the spirit, and the ability to overcome any difficulty and create any miracle. We, the working class, can lead everything and create everything!

Over the past decade, in the field repair workshop of my unit, there were neither technicians nor engineers, and the factory equipment was primitive, with no complete technical data. For a long time, more than ten of us "rough men" have been fighting alongside the troops, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle, self-reliance, and daring to think, dare to do, and dare to pioneer. We overcame countless difficulties and successively repaired five large modern aircraft that those bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" thought could not be repaired, effectively ensuring readiness and flight training, and saving the country a large amount of expenditure.

In the process of repairing the aircraft, we encountered countless difficulties, but we, the working class and revolutionary soldiers, with hearts loyal to Chairman Mao, are all heroes who dare to face any challenge! In 1964, there was a small part on the aircraft radar that was severely damaged due to long-term flight. The structure of the part was complex, and according to the old rules, the field repair workshop could not manufacture it. This directly affected the flight training and readiness of the troops. At that time, making this part ourselves was actually a struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with our enemies, the determination to restore the old on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand on our own feet among the nations of the world." We made up our minds to try to make it ourselves. After repeated experiments and many failures, we finally succeeded in making it in a short time. The ironclad facts gave the Chinese Khrushchev a resounding slap in the face. The facts prove: the wisest and most talented are the workers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and have practical experience.

The Chinese Khrushchev wants us to kneel down before the "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, surrender to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and ultimately deny that the working class is the master of the times, oppose the leading position of the working class, and attempt to elevate the bourgeoisie to power, seize power, and turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship, making the working class return to the old society to be slaves! This is something the working class will never accept!

Chairman Mao and the working class are heart to heart. He supports us, and we must make him proud. We, the working class, can indeed lead everything. We must take up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly expose the reactionary essence of the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the working class being "ignorant," and fight to the end.

    给中国赫鲁晓夫一记最响亮的耳光
    海军某部修理厂老工人　马永祯
    伟大领袖毛主席最近发出指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”毛主席的最新指示是对我们工人阶级最高的评价，大长了我们工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫这个头号大工贼、大叛徒，出于反革命的本能，与我们伟大领袖毛主席大唱反调，极力吹捧资产阶级反动“权威”，说什么他们“懂得技术”“精明干练”，而对工人阶级却进行了恶毒的污蔑，胡说什么工人阶级“没有文化”，“愚蠢”“无知”，在中国赫鲁晓夫眼里我们工人阶级就是“没有本事”的“群氓”、“阿斗”。呸！这完全是资产阶级、贵族老爷的腔调！
    中国赫鲁晓夫竖起你的耳朵听着：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级有胆略，有志气，有才干，什么困难都能克服，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。我们工人阶级能够领导一切，能够创造一切！
    十几年来，我所在的部队野外修理厂里，既没有技术员，又没有工程师，工厂设备简陋，没有什么成套的技术资料。长时期以来，我们十多个“大老粗”同部队的指战员战斗在一起，靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，发扬“艰苦奋斗”“自力更生”和敢想、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，克服了种种困难，先后大修了五架在那些资产阶级“专家”“权威”看来无法修复的大型现代化飞机，有力地保证了战备和飞行训练，为国家节约了大量开支。
    在飞机的修理过程中，我们遇到这样那样的困难是无法计数的，但是我们工人阶级和革命战士凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，个个都是顶着万难上的英雄汉！一九六四年，在飞机雷达上有一个很小的零件，由于长期飞行，大量损坏。机件构造复杂，按照旧的条条框框，野外修理厂不能制作，眼看直接影响部队的飞行训练和战备工作。当时，自己动手制造这个零件，实际上就是同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的一场斗争。我们反复学习了毛主席的伟大教导：
  “我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力”，下定决心，自己试制。经过大家的反复试验，在多次失败之后，终于在很短时间内试制成功。铁的事实，给了中国赫鲁晓夫一记最响亮的耳光。事实证明：最聪明、最有才能的是我们无限忠于毛主席的有实践经验的工人。
    中国赫鲁晓夫要我们跪倒在资产阶级“权威”的脚下，向帝、修、反屈膝投降，说到底就是否定工人阶级是时代的主人，反对工人阶级的领导地位，而妄图把资产阶级吹捧上台，由他们篡夺政权，使无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，叫我们工人阶级重新回到旧社会，当牛做马！这是我们工人阶级一万个不能答应的！
    毛主席和我们工人阶级心连心，他老人家为我们撑腰，我们一定为毛主席争气。我们工人阶级就是能够领导一切。我们要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底揭穿中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的工人“无知”论的反动实质。
