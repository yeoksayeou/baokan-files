Hanoi, September 30 (Xinhua) — Representatives of various circles in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, held a rally on the evening of September 29 to warmly celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Present at the rally were: Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Vice Premier of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Le Quoc Vy, Central Committee member of the Vietnam Workers' Party, Central Committee member of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, and President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Nguyen Quoc Vu, Deputy Foreign Minister Vuong Van Dung, Lieutenant General Le Cong Danh representing the Vietnam People's Army, Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam and Vice President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Son Quang Vu, and Deputy Director of the Vietnam Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee Phan Hong, among others.

The delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in North Vietnam, led by Nguyen Van Tien, also attended the rally.

The Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, Chen Liang, and embassy staff were invited to attend the rally.

Son Quang Vu spoke at the meeting.

He pointed out that under the glorious leadership of the Communist Party of China and the beloved Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, through a long period of arduous struggle filled with sacrifices and glorious victories, achieved revolutionary victory and made tremendous achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

He said, "The Chinese people, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are deeply and extensively carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, establishing revolutionary committees in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and are now moving forward to achieve a comprehensive victory in this revolution. In the process of carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people are vigorously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions to 'grasp revolution, promote production' and fully play the leading role of the working class, continuing to achieve new developments in the cause of socialist construction."

He said, "The great victory of the Chinese revolution, the existence and development of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people's lofty support for the world revolutionary movement are a powerful encouragement to the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving to win liberation and the right to exist, defend national independence, and build their own countries."

He said, "The Vietnamese people resolutely support the will of the Chinese people to recover their inseparable territory—Taiwan, and strongly condemn the war provocations of American imperialism against the People's Republic of China."

Son Quang Vu praised the unbreakable unity and friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China.

He said, "The Vietnamese people remember the words of Chairman Mao in his telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho on the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam: 'The brothers of South Vietnam and all the Vietnamese people can believe that your struggle is our struggle. Seven hundred million Chinese people are the strong rear of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear of the Vietnamese people.' Chairman Mao's words above are a concentrated expression of the iron will of the Chinese people, a crystallization of the lofty sentiments of the Chinese people, and a powerful encouragement to us Vietnamese people who are advancing on a road full of hardships, sacrifices, but will definitely achieve a thorough victory."

He said, "On behalf of the Vietnamese people, we express our deepest and most heartfelt thanks to Chairman Mao for his concern for our struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and to the brotherly Communist Party of China, government, and people for their great and precious support and assistance."

After talking about the great victories achieved by the military and people of both the North and South of Vietnam, Son Quang Vu said, "Our 31 million compatriots will strive to implement Chairman Hu's call on July 20 this year, 'For independence and freedom, our 31 million compatriots are determined to overcome all difficulties, make any sacrifice, fight to the end, and win, liberate the South, defend the North, and move towards the peaceful reunification of the country.'"

Chen Liang, the Charge d'Affaires, was invited to speak at the rally. Chen Liang pointed out that in the 19 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, 700 million Chinese people, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved extremely brilliant achievements in the fields of politics, economy, military, culture, and more.

Chen Liang elaborated on the great victory and profound significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao. He pointed out that at the time of celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is excellent. Revolutionary committees have been established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China, except for Taiwan Province.

He said, "All the victories achieved by our people are the result of the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China headed by the great leader Chairman Mao, and are the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

In his speech, Chen Liang severely condemned the intensified counter-revolutionary global collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union, attempting to redivide the world. When talking about the Soviet revisionist leadership's armed occupation of Czechoslovakia, he said, "The Czechoslovakian event is not an isolated event. Since the United States acknowledges that Czechoslovakia and even Eastern Europe are within the sphere of influence of the Soviet revisionists, the condition is that the Soviet revisionists acknowledge that the Middle East and South Vietnam, and even Southeast Asia, are within the sphere of influence of the United States. The Soviet revisionists will definitely continue to betray the Arab people, and they will definitely continue to betray the Vietnamese people. This is certain, without a doubt."

Chen Liang expressed warm congratulations to the heroic Vietnamese people for their great victories under the leadership of their great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh in the war against American aggression for national salvation.

Chen Liang said, "The situation of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression for national salvation is excellent. However, American imperialism, in close collusion with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, will definitely make desperate struggles. They will peddle more cunning and treacherous peace talks, and they will make more ruthless military adventures. Although the Vietnamese people will encounter various difficulties and twists and turns on their way forward, we are convinced that the brotherly Vietnamese people, upholding the spirit of thorough revolution, persisting in a protracted war, will definitely achieve the final victory in the war against American aggression for national salvation."

Chen Liang said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Seven hundred million Chinese people are the strong rear of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear of the Vietnamese people.' The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism, as always, firmly support the Vietnamese people to carry the war against American aggression for national salvation to the end!"

After the rally, Vietnamese artists performed artistic programs.

On September 28, workers from the Kim Star Rubber Factory, Hanoi Soap Factory, and Thang Long Cigarette Factory in Hanoi held rallies to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

On September 27, the Vietnam Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee, the Ministry of Culture, and the Vietnam-China Friendship Association held a film screening to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. At the screening, the Chinese color documentary films "The Red Lantern" and "Sisters on the Grassland" were shown.

In addition, the Vietnam-China Friendship Association also held a report meeting on the situation of Chinese people aiding Vietnam in the fight against American aggression on September 26.

    新华社河内三十日电　越南民主共和国首都河内市各界人民代表九月二十九日晚上举行集会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    出席集会的有：越南劳动党中央政治局委员、越南民主共和国政府副总理黎清毅，越南劳动党中央委员、越南祖国战线中央委员、越中友好协会会长黄国越，外交部副部长黄文进，越南人民军代表黎宪梅少将，越南国会常设委员会秘书长、越中友好协会副会长孙光阀，越南对外文化联络委员会副主任范鸿等。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团团长阮文进也出席了集会。
    中国驻越南大使馆临时代办陈亮和使馆工作人员应邀出席了集会。
    孙光阀在会上讲话。
    他指出，中国人民在光荣的中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席的天才领导下，经过充满艰苦、牺牲和辉煌战功的长期的斗争取得了革命的胜利，并且在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得了巨大的成就。
    他说，“中国人民高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，深入和广泛地进行无产阶级文化大革命，在二十九个省、市和自治区成立了革命委员会，并且目前正在进而夺取这一革命的全面胜利。中国人民在进行无产阶级文化大革命的过程中，大力实现毛主席的‘抓革命，促生产’和充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用等指示，继续使社会主义建设事业获得新的发展。”
    他说，“中国革命的伟大胜利，中华人民共和国的存在和发展，中国人民对世界革命运动的崇高支持，是对奋起争取解放和生存权利，保卫民族独立和建设自己祖国的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各个被压迫民族的强有力的鼓舞。”
    他说，越南人民坚决支持中国人民收回自己不可分割的领土——台湾的意志，并且强烈谴责美帝国主义对中华人民共和国进行战争挑衅行动。
    孙光阀赞扬了越中两国人民之间牢不可破的团结和友谊。
    他说，“越南人民铭记毛主席在越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的时候给阮友寿主席的贺电中所说的话：‘兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。’毛主席以上的话，是中国人民的钢铁意志的集中表现，是中国人民的崇高情谊的结晶，是对在充满艰苦、牺牲但一定取得彻底胜利的道路上前进的我们越南人民的强有力的鼓舞。”
    他说，“我们代表越南人民，向毛主席对我们的抗美救国斗争的关心以及兄弟的中国共产党、政府和人民的巨大、宝贵的支持和帮助，表示最衷心和深深的感谢。”
    孙光阀在谈到越南南北两方军民所取得的巨大胜利之后说：“我国三千一百万同胞努力实现胡主席今年七月二十日发出的‘为了独立和自由，我国三千一百万同胞决心克服一切困难，不惜牺牲，决战决胜’的号召，必将在新时期中继续前进，狠狠地打，连续地打，广泛出击，一直打到彻底胜利，解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国。”
    陈亮临时代办应邀在集会上发表了讲话。陈亮指出，中华人民共和国成立十九年来，七亿中国人民，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在政治、经济、军事、文化等各个领域都取得了极其辉煌的成就。
    陈亮阐述了由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利及其深远意义。他指出，在我们欢庆中华人民共和国成立十九周年的时候，我国无产阶级文化大革命的形势大好。中国全国除台湾省以外的二十九个省、市、自治区都成立了革命委员会。
    他说，我国人民所取得的一切胜利，都是以伟大领袖毛主席为首的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党领导的结果，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    陈亮在讲话中严厉谴责美苏加紧进行反革命的全球大勾结，妄图重新瓜分世界的罪恶阴谋。他谈到苏修领导集团武装占领捷克斯洛伐克的事件时说，捷克斯洛伐克事件不是一个孤立的事件。既然美帝承认捷克斯洛伐克乃至东欧是苏修的势力范围，其条件当然是苏修承认中东和南越乃至东南亚是美帝的势力范围。苏修一定要继续出卖阿拉伯人民，一定要继续出卖越南人民，这是肯定的，毫无疑义的。
    陈亮表示热烈祝贺英雄的越南人民，在其伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导下，在抗美救国战争中所取得的伟大胜利。
    陈亮说，越南人民抗美救国战争形势大好。但是，美帝国主义在苏修叛徒集团的密切配合下，一定还要作疯狂的挣扎。他们还会兜售更加阴险狡猾的和谈阴谋，他们会进行更加穷凶极恶的军事冒险。尽管越南人民在前进的道路上，还会遇到各种困难和曲折，我们坚信，兄弟的越南人民，发扬彻底革命精神，坚持持久战争，必将取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    陈亮说，我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，将更高地举起无产阶级国际主义旗帜，一如既往，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！
    集会后，越南文艺工作者演出了文艺节目。
    九月二十八日，河内市金星橡胶厂、河内肥皂制造厂和升龙卷烟厂的职工为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年举行了集会。
    二十七日，越南对外文化联络委员会、文化部和越中友好协会为庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年举行了电影招待会。在招待会上放映了中国彩色纪录影片钢琴伴唱《红灯记》和《草原英雄小姐妹》。
    此外，越中友好协会还在二十六日举行了关于中国人民援越抗美情况的报告会。
