The Albanian people have achieved glorious victories in socialist construction. The Elbasan Cement Plant officially began production. Muftiu attended the opening ceremony. Minister Enjela and Acting Charge d'Affaires Li Tingquan delivered speeches, and the attendees repeatedly shouted enthusiastically: "Enver—Mao Zedong!"

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, TIRANA, October 12 - The Elbasan Cement Plant in Albania was officially inaugurated on October 10 in Elbasan.

The building of the Elbasan Cement Plant prominently displayed portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. Many workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, government officials, and students, carrying red flags and banners, joyfully attended the inauguration ceremony to celebrate another glorious victory of the Albanian people in socialist construction.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Muftiu, Minister of Trade Enjela, Minister of Construction Dragoti, Deputy Minister of Industry Drakou, First Secretary of the Elbasan District Party Committee Menzergu, and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Elbasan District People's Assembly Razli, attended the ceremony.

Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Li Tingquan, was also invited to attend the ceremony.

Minister of Trade Enjela and Acting Charge d'Affaires Li Tingquan spoke at the meeting.

Comrade Enjela first, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Council of Ministers, extended warm congratulations to the workers who built this cement plant.

Enjela said, it is on the eve of the great celebration of the 60th birthday of our beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, that we are holding this important ceremony to inaugurate this project. Under the leadership of Comrade Hoxha and the glorious Labor Party, we have achieved glorious achievements. We wish Comrade Hoxha a long life to benefit the Party and the people, to benefit socialism and communism.

Enjela said, we follow the great principle of self-reliance of the Labor Party and are not intimidated by the blockade of imperialism and revisionism. Our designers and builders have devoted all their creative energies to construction. Under the leadership of the Party, they have become outstanding builders, designers, and initiators of rationalization, greatly promoting the construction of our country. They have completed magnificent and complex projects such as the Ferri Fertilizer Plant, the Lazi Phosphorus Fertilizer Plant, and the Fush-Kruja Cement Plant. This shows the great power of our Labor Party and the Albanian people, and the courage and confidence of the Albanian people in the victory of socialist construction.

Comrade Enjela said, this plant was built with the internationalist aid of China. Chinese engineering and technical personnel, together with Albanian workers and experts, made tremendous efforts for the construction of this plant, completing it six months ahead of schedule. Comrade Enjela expressed gratitude to the Chinese friends and wished them greater achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong.

Comrade Enjela said, whether in cities or villages, in construction or industry, our people are everywhere studying the works of Comrade Hoxha and putting his teachings into practice to complete our tasks, strengthen our economy, consolidate our national defense, and heighten our revolutionary vigilance. We will always follow the Party's teaching of "one hand with a pickaxe, one hand with a gun." Comrade Enjela said, the Czechoslovakian incident has completely exposed the true face of the Khrushchev revisionists. The Khrushchev revisionists have become a gang of robbers and traitors, colluding with the U.S. imperialists to try to rule the world and suppress the peoples of various countries. The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian government's brave and firm stance on the Warsaw Pact has made Albania even stronger and more prestigious.

Acting Charge d'Affaires Li Tingquan said in his speech, the Elbasan Cement Plant officially began production on the eve of the great joyous day of the 60th birthday of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people. This is particularly worthy of celebration.

Li Tingquan said, under the wise leadership of the glorious Albanian Labor Party headed by the great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people are carrying out a profound socialist revolutionary significance of the revolutionization movement and achieving one great victory after another. This revolutionization movement has further consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat and greatly promoted the development of Albania's socialist construction. Comrade Hoxha said: "The people have become invincible heroes and, with high awareness, great confidence, and rare wisdom, realize everything pointed out by the Party." The Albanian people, following the teachings of the Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, have overcome all kinds of difficulties and completed the cement plant half a year ahead of schedule, which is of great significance to the development of Albania's national economy and national defense construction.

Li Tingquan said, our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The Albanian Labor Party and people have always held high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely opposed the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, and waged a struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership." Recently, the Albanian government's solemn announcement of withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact is another heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, a great encouragement to the struggle of the peoples of Eastern European countries against the Soviet revisionist traitors, and a great contribution to the international communist movement.

Li Tingquan said, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, after being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 700 million Chinese people will better fulfill their internationalist duties of the proletariat. The Chinese people are determined to support the revolutionary struggle of the Albanian people in various ways. Let us, the two parties and the two peoples, inspire, learn from, and support each other in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys, and march forward hand in hand. No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together.

During the speeches of Comrade Enjela and Comrade Li Tingquan, the attendees repeatedly shouted enthusiastically: "Enver—Mao Zedong!" "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between Albania and China!"

After the meeting, Comrade Muftiu cut the ribbon to officially inaugurate the plant. Then, the attendees toured the plant's production process.

The Elbasan Cement Plant is one of the important projects of Albania's Fourth Five-Year Plan. The completion of this plant plays an important role in Albania's socialist construction.

    阿人民在社会主义建设中取得辉煌胜利
    爱尔巴桑水泥厂正式投入生产　穆夫蒂乌参加开工典礼
    恩杰拉部长和李庭荃临时代办发表讲话，与会者不断热情高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”
    新华社地拉那十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚爱尔巴桑水泥厂，十日在爱尔巴桑隆重举行投入生产典礼。
    爱尔巴桑水泥厂的建筑物上高悬着阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的画像。许多工人、农业合作社社员、机关干部，和学生举着红旗和标语牌，兴高采烈地前来参加投入生产典礼，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义建设中所取得的又一辉煌胜利。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员穆夫蒂乌，贸易部部长恩杰拉，建筑部部长德拉戈蒂，工矿部副部长多拉库，劳动党爱尔巴桑区委员会第一书记门泽尔吉乌和爱尔巴桑区人民会议执行委员会主席拉兹里等参加了开工典礼。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃也应邀出席了典礼。
    阿尔巴尼亚贸易部长恩杰拉和李庭荃临时代办先后在会上讲了话。
    恩杰拉同志首先代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议向建设这个水泥厂的职工表示热烈祝贺。
    恩杰拉说，正是在我们亲爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志六十寿辰盛大节日的前夕，我们举行这一重要工程的投入生产典礼。我们在以霍查同志为首的光荣的劳动党的领导下，取得了辉煌的成就。我们祝愿霍查同志长寿，以造福于党和人民，造福于社会主义和共产主义。
    恩杰拉说，我们遵循劳动党的自力更生的伟大原则，没有被帝国主义和修正主义的封锁所吓倒。我们的设计人员和建筑工人把自己全部的创造力量投入到建设中去，在党的领导下成了出色的建筑者、设计者和合理化倡议者，大大地推动了我国的建设，建成了如费里氮肥厂、拉兹磷肥厂、弗什—克鲁亚水泥厂等宏伟和复杂的工程项目。这表明我们劳动党和我国人民的伟大力量，表明我国人民的英勇气概和对社会主义建设的胜利所充满的信心。
    恩杰拉同志说，这个厂是在中国国际主义援助下建成的。中国工程技术人员同阿尔巴尼亚工人和专家一起为这个厂的建设作出了巨大的努力，使这个厂提前六个月完工。恩杰拉同志对中国朋友表示感谢，并祝他们在由杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，取得更加巨大的成就。
    恩杰拉同志说，无论是在城市和乡村，还是在建筑业和工业中，我国人民到处都在认真学习霍查同志的著作，把霍查同志的教导贯彻到实践中去，以完成我们的各项任务，加强我国的经济，巩固我国的国防，提高革命警惕性。我们永远遵循党的“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的教导。恩杰拉同志说，捷克斯洛伐克事件彻底撕破了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的假面具。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者已经变成一帮强盗和叛徒，他们勾结美帝企图统治世界，镇压各国人民。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府对华沙条约所采取的英勇的和坚定的立场，使阿尔巴尼亚变得更加强大，威望也更加提高了。
    李庭荃临时代办在讲话中说，爱尔巴桑水泥厂在阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友霍查同志六十寿辰的大喜日子的前夕正式投入生产，这是特别值得祝贺的。
    李庭荃说，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，正在开展一场具有深刻的社会主义革命意义的革命化运动，并取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。这一革命化运动进一步巩固了无产阶级专政，大大推动了阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设事业的发展。霍查同志说：“人民成为不可战胜的勇士，并以高度的觉悟，巨大的信心和罕见的才智实现党所指出的一切。”阿尔巴尼亚人民遵照劳动党和霍查同志的教导，战胜种种困难，提前半年建成了水泥厂，这对阿尔巴尼亚的国民经济的发展和国防建设事业都具有重要的意义。
    李庭荃说，我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民，一贯高举马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义进行了针锋相对的斗争。”最近，阿尔巴尼亚政府庄严宣布退出华沙条约的革命行动，是对苏修叛徒集团的又一沉重打击，是对东欧各国人民反对苏修叛徒集团斗争的巨大鼓舞，是对国际共产主义运动的重大贡献。
    李庭荃说，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，将更好地履行自己的无产阶级国际主义义务。中国人民决心用各种方式坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命斗争，让我们两党、两国人民在反对美帝、苏修及其走狗的斗争中互相鼓舞、互相学习、互相支持，携手前进。不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    恩杰拉同志和李庭荃同志讲话时，与会者不断热情高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“阿中两国永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
    大会结束后，穆夫蒂乌同志为工厂正式投入生产剪了彩。接着，与会者参观了工厂的生产过程。
    爱尔巴桑水泥厂是阿尔巴尼亚第四个五年计划的重要工程项目之一。这座工厂的建成，对阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设起着重要的作用。
