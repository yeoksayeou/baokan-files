The wide new working face of the fourth extraction section of the Wood City Gorge Coal Mine is supported by sturdy wooden pillars, standing like iron columns, firmly propping up the top of the face with nets. A portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hangs in the center, and Mao Zedong quotations are displayed on both sides. People cheer in unison, and the mine shaft today sees the eternal red sun rising! An hour before the start of the shift, the 120 workers of the fourth section have already arrived, each one spirited and full of fighting spirit.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with the strong support of the revolutionary committee and the stationed People's Liberation Army, relying on their hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, the workers of the fourth section have gone through three months of arduous experimentation. They overcame one obstacle after another, broke through one difficulty after another, and finally successfully created the "net support" coal mining method. This is the first new coal mining method since the mine was established. The monthly production is expected to double compared to the original, and the coal recovery rate will increase from the original 60% to over 95%. Moreover, the working area is spacious, the ventilation conditions are good, it is safe, and it is convenient for operations and learning. Today, the "net support" coal mining method will be officially put into production. Everyone decided to bring the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" to the construction site, using living facts to criticize the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in slandering the working class and advocating "expert management," and to hold a large-scale on-site criticism session.

Amidst a thunderous chorus of "Down with China's Khrushchev," the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" were brought in, and a fierce battle began.

Old worker Wei Zhiyuan took the lead in speaking. He first recited the highest directive: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, they are very powerful, but in reality, they are not so. From a long-term point of view, it is not in the interests of the U.S. imperialists to launch wars, and still less so for the various people they oppress, create, and be burdened by. This also applies to sweeping the floor. Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not disappear by itself." He then angrily pointed at the capitalist roader's nose and said, "You stubborn capitalist roader, you stubbornly follow the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev. China's Khrushchev shouts about relying on factory directors, engineers, and technicians, and you also talk nonsense about engineers being the treasures of the industrial front. Those 'treasures' you raise are fat and lazy, always seeking foreign help, always flipping through books, and what have they accomplished in the end?"

The capitalist roader stammered, "We didn't... " "Don't talk nonsense!" someone shouted, "You are working towards capitalist restoration, towards bourgeois dictatorship. Let me tell you, your tricks will never succeed in a lifetime!"

Next, old worker He Shankuang denounced:

"In 1966, a reactionary technical 'authority' brought three technicians to the fourth section to implement some 'horizontal layered coal mining method.' They also invited three engineers from the Academy of Sciences to help. These gentlemen neither went down into the mine nor listened to the workers' opinions. They spent all day in the office flipping through books, moving dogmas, and closing the door to create schemes. Later, they came up with a plan from the pile of books that was detached from reality. This plan, once put forward, required tens of millions of yuan, and all the necessary items were 'hydraulic parts' and steel pipes from jet planes that were not available domestically. As a result, after a long period of 'reform,' resources were wasted, production was affected, and nothing was achieved. Instead, accidents occurred, and two of our class brothers were sacrificed, with eight comrades almost suffocating in the mine..."

He Shankuang became more and more angry, his voice changing: "This is all the 'achievement' of your technical 'authorities,' this is the 'benefit' of 'expert management'! This blood debt we must settle!" The venue immediately boiled over, and the deep hatred stirred up the boundless fury of the revolutionary miners. Everyone stood up and shouted in waves, "Down with China's Khrushchev!" "The working class must lead everything!" The slogans echoed through the mine shaft, shaking the mountains...

"Comrades, I want to denounce!" Old foreman and Communist Party member Qiao Bingyang, who was born and raised in bitterness, stood up with tears in his eyes and said, "In the old society full of evil, the capitalists called us miners 'coal blackies' and treated us like cattle and horses. While alive, they sucked our marrow, and when dead, they threw us into 'mass graves' to feed dogs. The great leader Chairman Mao led us to stand up and gain liberation, allowing us to rise to the position of the leading class. But China's Khrushchev does not treat us as human beings, slandering us as 'mob' and 'stupid.' China's Khrushchev and you capitalist roaders, starting from the same reactionary position, breathe from the same nostril, treating us workers as 'speaking tools.' In the past, how many technical reform suggestions did we raise, all of which were ignored by you, and you even said, 'Miners only know how to carry coal, they don't understand anything'..."

Qiao Bingyang had not finished speaking when old worker Zhu Wenzheng rushed forward, saying, "We raised reform suggestions, and these capitalist roaders not only did not support us but also created countless obstacles. They used thick books to suppress us, criticized us in large meetings and cursed us in small meetings, calling us 'ignorant' and 'frogs wanting to eat swans.' Why? It is to prevent us workers from making a revolution, so that the reactionary technical 'authorities' can long rule the mine and turn the mine into a black base for restoring capitalism. This is absolutely not allowed! No matter how long your black hands are, we will cut them off; no matter how thick your black lines are, we will smash them. We workers will definitely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao."

At this time, young worker Li Cunren, pointing at the reactionary technical "authority" with one hand and at the net with the other, said, "Open your dog eyes and see the wisdom and strength of the working class! You capitalist roaders and reactionary technical 'authorities' are the most ignorant fools. The most intelligent are the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We workers do not rely on heaven, earth, money, or foreigners, but only on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We only use some scrap wire to successfully create a new coal mining method. You have always thought that 'problems that cannot be solved,' we workers have solved. We workers innovate for the revolution, for the protection of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, so we are not afraid of hardship, not afraid of fatigue, and can overcome any difficulty and create any miracle. This is something you can only dream of." At this moment, the venue was in an uproar, and the workers raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Down with China's Khrushchev!" Under the mighty power of the working class, the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" were disgraced and in a miserable state.

In the midst of the fervor, Guo Huijun, a graduate of Beijing Mining Institute and a new worker who participated in the "net support" coal mining method trial, stood up excitedly to speak. He said, "In the past, China's Khrushchev and his agents vigorously instilled in us the bourgeois ideology of 'fame and fortune,' looking down on workers and peasants. I now truly realize that the most intelligent in the world are the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The working class has the reddest hearts and the most thorough revolutionary spirit. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The working class is the leading class.' China's Khrushchev and his agents slander the working class, advocating 'expert management' with the evil purpose of not wanting the working class to lead, attempting to let the bourgeoisie seize power and restore capitalism. We must thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents, making them never able to rise again. We young people who come out of school must listen to Chairman Mao's words, accept the re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and swear to be the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

Guo Huijun became more and more excited, and the criticism session became more and more intense. At this time, Zhao Kuijun, the responsible person of the revolutionary leading group of the section, also excitedly said, "In the past, we workers made a revolution and were still suppressed, all because the capitalist roaders usurped the power of the factories and mines. Chairman Mao pointed out that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. With power, we have everything. We must defend the red power—the revolutionary committee. A small handful of class enemies want to change the sky and destroy the red power, we will never agree. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and 'seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform.' We will fight to the end, not stopping until we have completely defeated the small handful of class enemies!" Immediately, the slogans "Down with China's Khrushchev!" "Down with the small handful of class enemies!" "Seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform!" "Swear to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" echoed through the heavens and lasted for a long time...

After the criticism session ended, the workers of the fourth extraction section, with the joy of victory and revolutionary enthusiasm, launched a coal-grabbing battle on their newly created construction site. That day, they created a record of more than one and a half times the original daily production, writing a song of seizing the revolution and promoting production with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

    矿井里的怒涛
    ——记木城涧煤矿回采四段的一次现场批判会
    换新　美松　陈兴
    木城涧煤矿回采四段宽阔的新掌子面上，一根根木桩象擎天的铁柱，牢固地撑着掌子面顶上的托网。伟大领袖毛主席画像悬挂在中央，毛主席语录牌林立两旁。人们齐声欢呼，坑道里今天升起了永远不落的红太阳！离上班时间还有一个小时，四段的一百二十名工人早已到齐了，个个精神振奋，斗志昂扬。
    四段的工人们，在毛主席最新指示指引下，在矿革委会和驻矿解放军的大力支持下，凭着百十颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，经过三个月的艰苦试验，排除一个个障碍，冲破一道道难关，“托网式”采煤法终于创造成功了。这是建矿以来的第一个新式采煤法，月产量要比原来提高一倍，回煤率由原来的百分之六十提高到百分之九十五以上；而且场地宽阔，通风条件好，既安全，又便于作业和学习。今天，“托网式”采煤法要正式投产了，大家决定把走资派和反动技术“权威”揪到施工现场，用活生生的事实，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人污蔑工人阶级、宣扬“专家治厂”的罪行，开展一次现场大批判。
    在一阵“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的惊雷般的口号声中，走资派和反动技术“权威”被带了进来，一场激烈的战斗开始了。
    仇人相见，分外眼红。老工人魏志远抢先发言。他首先背诵最高指示：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”接着愤怒地指着走资派的鼻子说：“你这个顽固不化的走资派，拚命跟着中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的指挥棒转。中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷要依靠厂长、工程师和技师，你也胡说什么工程师是工业战线的宝贝。你们豢养的那些‘宝贝’们，吃得肥头大耳，到处去‘求洋’，整天翻书本，到底搞出了什么名堂？”走资派支支吾吾地说：“没搞成……。”“别胡说八道！”不知是谁大吼了一声：“你们搞的是资本主义复辟，搞的是资产阶级专政，告诉你，你们这套鬼主意一辈子也搞不成！”
    紧接着，老工人郝善芳控诉了：
    “一九六六年，一个反动技术‘权威’带了三个技术员到四段来搞什么‘水平分层采煤法’，还从科学院请了三个工程师来帮忙。这些老爷们一不下矿井，二不听取工人意见，整天蹲在办公室里翻书本，搬教条，闭门造车，后来从书堆里搬出了个脱离实际的洋方案。这个方案一拿出来就要用三十几万元钱，需要的尽是国内没有的‘液压零件’、喷气式飞机上的钢管。结果‘改革’了好长时间，浪费了资财，影响了生产，什么也没搞成，反倒发生了故障，牺牲了我们两个阶级兄弟，还有八个同志几乎憋死在井里……。”
    郝善芳越说越气，嗓门都变了：“这都是你们技术‘权威’的功劳，这都是‘专家治厂’的好处！这笔血债我们一定要讨还！”会场立即沸腾起来了，血泪深仇激起革命矿工的万丈怒火。大家霍地站起来，怒潮般高呼：“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“工人阶级必须领导一切！”口号声激荡着坑道，震撼了群山……。
    “同志们，我要控诉！”苦水里生、苦水里长的老班长、共产党员乔炳扬，满眼泪花站起来说：“在那万恶的旧社会，资本家叫我们工人‘煤黑子’，拿我们当牛马。活着被敲骨吸髓，死了丢进‘万人坑’喂狗。伟大领袖毛主席领导我们翻身得解放，让我们登上领导阶级的地位。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却不把我们当人看待，污蔑我们是‘群氓’、‘愚蠢’。中国赫鲁晓夫和你们这些走资派从同一个反动立场出发，一个鼻子眼里出气，把我们工人当成‘会说话的工具’。过去我们提了多少技术改革的意见，都被你们打入冷宫，还胡说什么：‘矿工就会背煤，啥也不懂’……。”
    乔炳扬还没说完，老工人朱文正一气冲了过来，说：“我们提了改革意见，这些走资派不但不支持，反而百般刁难，用大书本子压我们，大会批评小会骂，骂我们：‘不懂天高地厚’、‘癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉’。他们为了什么？就是为了不让我们工人干革命，好让反动技术‘权威’长期统治矿山，把矿山变成复辟资本主义的黑基地。这一万个办不到！你们的黑手再长，我们也要砍断；你们的黑线再粗，我们也要砸烂。我们工人阶级就是要走毛主席指引的道路。”
    这时，青年工人李存仁，一手指着反动技术“权威”，一手指着托网说：“睁开你的狗眼，看看我们工人阶级的智慧和力量吧！你们这些走资派和反动技术‘权威’，是最没有知识的大蠢物。最聪明的是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级。我们工人阶级不靠天，不靠地，不靠钱，不靠洋，就靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，只用些废钢丝就创造成功了新式采煤方法。你们历来认为‘没有办法解决的问题’，我们工人阶级解决了。我们工人搞革新，为的是革命，为的是保卫毛主席的革命路线，所以不怕苦，不怕累，天大的困难也能克服，任何奇迹也能创造出来。这是你们做梦也办不到的。”这时会场又轰动起来，工人们振臂高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”在工人阶级的巨大威力下，走资派和反动技术“权威”威风扫地，狼狈不堪。
    群情激愤中，参加这次“托网式”采煤法试验的北京矿业学院毕业生、新工人郭会均激动地站起来发言，他说：“过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人极力向我们灌输‘成名成家’，轻视工农的资产阶级思想。我现在才真正认识到，世界上最聪明的是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级。工人阶级心最红，最有革命的彻底性。毛主席教导我们：‘工人阶级是领导阶级’。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人污蔑工人阶级，大搞‘专家治厂’的罪恶目的，就是不要工人阶级领导，妄想让资产阶级来夺权专政，复辟资本主义。我们一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人批倒批臭，让他们永世不得翻身。我们从学校里出来的青年一定要听毛主席的话，接受工农兵给我们的再教育，誓做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    郭会均越说越激动，批判会越开越激烈。这时，段革命领导小组负责人赵奎俊也激动地说：“过去我们工人干革命还受打击，就是因为走资派篡夺了厂矿大权。毛主席指出，革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权，就有了一切。我们一定要保卫红色政权——革命委员会。一小撮阶级敌人妄想变天，破坏红色政权，我们坚决不答应。我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，‘认真搞好斗、批、改’。把一小撮阶级敌人斗倒斗臭，不获全胜，绝不收兵！”顿时，“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“打倒一小撮阶级敌人！”“认真搞好斗、批、改！”“誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线！”的口号声震天动地，经久不息……。
    批判会结束后，回采四段的工人们怀着胜利的喜悦和革命的豪情，在自己创造的新工地上展开了夺煤大战。当天，他们创造了超过原来日产量一倍半的高产纪录，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想谱写了一曲抓革命、促生产的凯歌。
