"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 16th, enthusiastically praising and firmly supporting the Mexican youth students' just struggle against oppression and massacre.

The article pointed out that the struggle of Mexican youth students has powerfully struck at U.S. imperialism and the Mexican reactionaries, causing U.S. imperialism and the Mexican reactionaries to panic greatly. For more than two months, they have repeatedly sent armed troops to brutally suppress and massacre the students, but the reactionaries' bullets and butcher knives cannot suppress the students' just struggle.

The article said, as the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. All the same, the reactionaries must be overthrown. We must not believe in the idea that the reactionaries are powerful and we are weak, or the idea that they are many, and we are few. As a matter of fact, they are not so powerful, not so many; while we are powerful and numerous. The reactionaries always bluster, but in reality, they are afraid of the revolution. They always fear that the people may rise in revolt. They always fear the growth of the people's revolutionary spirit. They always fear the people's revolutionary mass movements. They always fear the people's armed revolution. All the reactionaries are paper tigers. In essence, they are reactionary. In appearance, they are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All the same, the reactionaries must be overthrown. We must not believe in the idea that the reactionaries are powerful and we are weak, or the idea that they are many, and we are few. As a matter of fact, they are not so powerful, not so many; while we are powerful and numerous. The reactionaries always bluster, but in reality, they are afraid of the revolution. They always fear that the people may rise in revolt. They always fear the growth of the people's revolutionary spirit. They always fear the people's revolutionary mass movements. They always fear the people's armed revolution. All the reactionaries are paper tigers."

The article said that the more the reactionaries suppress, the more fiercely the people resist.

The article enthusiastically praised the Mexican youth students' courageous fighting spirit in this struggle, fearless of violence, and pointed out that this struggle has shaken the U.S. imperialism's backyard—the entire Latin America, turning the so-called "stable" and "peaceful" rear into the frontline of the struggle against U.S. imperialism. This struggle marks the growing awakening of the Mexican people and the Latin American people, and is a signal of the surging revolutionary struggle of the people of various countries in Latin America.

The article pointed out that the just struggle of Mexican youth students is not isolated; they have received the extensive sympathy and support of the revolutionary people of Latin America and the world. The revolutionary struggle of Mexican youth students has greatly inspired the Thai people. The Thai people will strengthen their armed struggle and, together with the revolutionary people of all countries in the world, launch more fierce attacks on U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries. The article expressed firm belief that the revolutionary movement of youth students in Mexico, Latin America, and the world will develop more broadly and deeply and will ultimately achieve victory.

    “泰国人民之声”坚决支持墨西哥学生正义斗争
    墨西哥学生的斗争震撼美帝后院
    新华社十七日讯  “泰国人民之声”电台十六日广播一篇文章，热烈赞扬和坚决支持墨西哥青年学生反迫害、反屠杀的正义斗争。
    文章指出，墨西哥青年学生的斗争，有力地打击了美帝国主义和墨西哥反动派，使美帝国主义和墨西哥反动派大为恐慌。两个多月来，他们不断派出武装军队对学生进行了野蛮的镇压和屠杀，但是反动派的子弹和屠刀决不能把学生的正义斗争镇压下去。
    文章说，正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”文章说，反动派镇压越厉害，人民群众的反抗就越猛烈。
    文章热烈赞扬墨西哥青年学生在这场斗争中所表现的不畏强暴的勇敢战斗精神，并且指出，这场斗争震撼了美帝国主义的后院——整个拉丁美洲，使美帝国主义的所谓“牢固”和“平静”的后方变成了反对美帝国主义斗争的前线。这场斗争标志着墨西哥人民和拉丁美洲人民日益高涨的新觉醒，是拉丁美洲各国人民革命斗争浪潮日益高涨的讯号。
    文章指出，墨西哥青年学生的正义斗争并不孤立，他们得到了拉丁美洲和全世界革命人民的广泛同情和支持。墨西哥青年学生的革命斗争，给泰国人民以巨大的鼓舞。泰国人民将加强自己的武装斗争，同世界各国革命人民一道向美帝国主义和一切反动派发动更加猛烈的进攻。文章表示坚信，墨西哥、拉丁美洲和全世界的青年学生的革命运动必将更加广泛深入地发展，并必将取得最后的胜利。
