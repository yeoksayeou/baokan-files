It was already very late at night. Chen Xianglong, an old worker from the Zhejiang Provincial Wuling County Fishery Company, was still bent over his desk, writing his thoughts and insights on studying Chairman Mao's works stroke by stroke. Fellow Zhejiang workers who came with him urged him to rest, but he said, "We, the working class, must lead everything. We must study Chairman Mao's works well. Only by continuously improving our political consciousness in the struggle can we fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all other work."

Chen Xianglong's words struck a chord with everyone. They all took out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all other work. The working class must also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle," and began to study them seriously.

During the Cultural Revolution, Chen Xianglong closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and was elected by the masses as a member of the Wuling County Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province. After Chairman Mao issued the great directive that "the working class must lead everything," he repeatedly examined his thoughts and work, always feeling that there was still a great gap between himself and Chairman Mao's requirements. He kept the revolutionary treasure, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," close to his chest and made a firm resolution to study Chairman Mao's works hard, continuously improve his political consciousness, and achieve new victories in the great revolutionary struggle for the working class to take the stage of the superstructure in the struggle-criticism-transformation.

He wrote in his diary: "With a red sun in my heart, I dare to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire. With a red sun in my heart, I have a direction in revolution."

During his time in Beijing for the celebration and visit, Chen Xianglong often recalled his father being beaten to death by landlords and fishery tyrants in the old society, his second sister starving to death, his third sister being sold at the age of five, and his little brother, who was just a month old, being given away. He himself, from a young age, followed his mother wandering and begging for food. He said, "The evil old society destroyed our family. It was Chairman Mao who led us to stand up. Father and mother are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao!"

This time, Chen Xianglong set out from Wuling to Beijing, carrying a small red notebook in his chest. On October 1st, he saw the great leader Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate; on October 5th, he saw Chairman Mao again in the magnificent Great Hall of the People. He recorded these most happy moments in his small red notebook. Every day, he carried this small red notebook with him, writing down his thoughts and insights on studying Chairman Mao's works at any time. He wrote in the small red notebook: "The working class is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Where Chairman Mao points, we rush; where Chairman Mao waves his hand, we advance!"

    不断提高自己的政治觉悟
    夜已经很深了。浙江省温岭县水产公司的老工人陈祥龙还伏在桌子上一笔一划地写学习毛主席著作的心得和体会。同来的浙江工人代表们劝他休息，他说：“我们工人阶级要领导一切，就得好好学习毛主席著作。只有在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，才能充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”
    陈祥龙的这些话，说到了大家的心坎上。大家又拿起毛主席“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的最新指示，认真地学习起来。
    陈祥龙在文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，被群众选为浙江省温岭县革命委员会委员。在毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大指示发出后，他不止一次地检查了自己的思想和工作，总觉得和毛主席的要求还有很大距离。他把革命宝书《毛主席语录》紧紧放在胸前，暗暗下了决心，要努力学习毛主席著作，不断提高政治觉悟，在工人阶级登上上层建筑斗、批、改政治舞台的伟大革命中立新功。他在自己日记中写道：“心中有个红太阳，刀山火海也敢上。心中有个红太阳，干革命来有方向。”
    陈祥龙在北京观礼、参观期间，脑海里经常浮现出父亲在旧社会被地主、渔霸活活打死，二妹活活饿死，三妹五岁就被卖给人家，刚满月的小弟弟送给人家，自己从小跟着妈妈到处流浪、要饭的悲惨情景。他说：“万恶的旧社会，使我们家破人亡。是毛主席他老人家领导我们翻了身，爹亲娘亲没有毛主席亲啊！”这次，陈祥龙从温岭出发来北京，把一个红色小笔记本揣在怀里。十月一日，他在天安门城楼上见到了伟大领袖毛主席；十月五日，他在雄伟的人民大会堂里，又一次见到了伟大领袖毛主席。他把这最最幸福的时刻，都一一记在这个小红本上。每天，他都带着这个小红本，随时写下自己学习毛主席著作的心得和体会。他在小红本上写道：“工人阶级永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，毛主席指向那里就奔向那里，毛主席挥手我前进！”
