Xingtai Normal School, following the instructions of Chairman Mao, has reformed the old admission system. It has selected students from among farmers with practical experience. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are very pleased with this admission method; the new students have become the main force in the school's struggle, criticism, and reform.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Shijiazhuang on the 23rd, following the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao to "select students from among workers and peasants with practical experience, have them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice," the Xingtai Normal School in Hebei Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has thoroughly broken with the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and completely reformed the old admission system. Recently, it has selected a batch of activists who have participated in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment for three years or more, who actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, who are poor and lower-middle peasants, demobilized soldiers, and revolutionary rebel soldiers to enroll.

In July this year, Xingtai Normal School, according to the instructions from higher authorities, decided to enroll a batch of new students. According to the original plan, they intended to enroll half of the new students from this year's junior high school graduates and the other half from rural youth. Just at this time, Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction to "select students from among workers and peasants with practical experience." The school revolutionary committee, with the help of the stationed PLA, immediately organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class, using Chairman Mao's latest instruction as a weapon to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev. On the basis of raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, they revised the original enrollment plan and decided to open the school's doors to workers, peasants, and soldiers, enrolling all those with practical experience.

As soon as the enrollment work began, under the leadership of the school revolutionary committee, six tripartite enrollment groups were formed, consisting of members of the school revolutionary committee, revolutionary teachers and students, and stationed PLA personnel. They went deep into the countryside, starting with investigations and research, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they exposed and criticized the revisionist educational line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. Many poor and lower-middle peasants angrily denounced: In the past, the various "examination gates" and "level gates" that the Chinese Khrushchev implemented were all aimed at keeping the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants out. The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev, in order to cultivate revisionist seedlings, said things like, "Normal school students will become teachers in the future and must speak politely, look good, and have regular features and posture." Their set of revisionist enrollment system that recognizes scores but not people, and recognizes people but not class, we hate it! The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants' denunciations of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line greatly raised the awareness of the enrollment group members, and they decided to carry out a thorough revolution, handing over the power to enroll students to the poor and lower-middle peasants, adopting a new enrollment system that combines leadership with the masses and recommendations with selection. The poor and lower-middle peasants selected the people they trusted the most, and after the enrollment group examined them, they were reported to higher authorities for approval.

In selecting students, the Xingtai Normal School enrollment group completely broke away from the old framework that only junior high school graduates could be enrolled. They put political standards first, selecting poor and lower-middle peasants, rural youth, and demobilized soldiers who had been tempered through the practice of the three great revolutionary movements, had good family backgrounds, good political performance, and firm stands in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and were loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to enroll. The school, based on the new students' experience and cultural level, shortened the school system from three years to one or two years. To ensure the political quality of the new students, the enrollment group used the method of the PLA to recruit new soldiers, going deep into the countryside and closely cooperating with the poor and lower-middle peasants to select students.

Because they insisted on putting proletarian politics in command and the poor and lower-middle peasants firmly grasped the power to recommend and select students, this time Xingtai Normal School enrolled 600 new students, more than 90% of whom were from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds. Among them, many are activists who actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, outstanding members of the Communist Party, Communist Youth League members, production team cadres, demobilized soldiers, and revolutionary rebel soldiers. They have generally engaged in production labor for more than three years, and some have labored for seven or eight years. The normal school enrolling such a batch of new students made the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants feel very happy. When the new students enrolled, many villages' poor and lower-middle peasants beat drums and gongs, enthusiastically sending them off, repeatedly instructing them not to lose the good tradition of hard work and simplicity of the poor and lower-middle peasants after enrolling, not to lose the hoe and pickaxe; and not to forget to return to the countryside to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants after graduation.

As soon as this batch of new students entered the school, they put down their bags and swore to Chairman Mao: Always maintain the character of the poor and lower-middle peasants, determined to, under the leadership of the working class, fight a good fight of struggle, criticism, and reform in the school, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. In the school, they actively participated in the revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and with the comrades of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the school, they were like brothers, often discussing together how to do a good job of the school's educational revolution. Soon after they entered the school, they put forward many good suggestions on how to do a good job of the school's struggle, criticism, and reform. The comrades of the Workers' Propaganda Team praised them as "the pillars of the school, the main force of struggle, criticism, and reform, and good assistants to the propaganda team."

The enrollment of this batch of new students also provided good teachers for the original students, teachers, and cadres in the school to receive re-education. These poor and lower-middle peasant youths all have deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, a good study style of combining theory with practice and learning and using together, and excellent qualities of hard work and simplicity. Some demobilized soldiers brought the excellent traditions and political work experience of the PLA into the school after enrolling. Now, the political atmosphere in Xingtai Normal School is very strong, and all aspects of work show a vigorous and prosperous situation.

    邢台师范学校遵照毛主席教导改革旧的招生制度
    从有实践经验的农民中选拔学生
    广大贫下中农对这一招生办法十分高兴；新生入学后成为学校斗批改的主力军
    据新华社石家庄二十三日电  遵照伟大领袖毛主席“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”的最新指示，河北省邢台师范学校在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，彻底改革旧的招生制度，最近选拔了一批参加阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动三年以上的活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、贫下中农、复员军人和革命造反派战士入学。
    今年七月，邢台师范学校根据上级指示，决定招收一批新生入学。按原计划，他们打算录取的新生一半是应届初中毕业生，另一半是农村知识青年。正在这时，毛主席发出了“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生”的最新指示。校革委会在驻校解放军的帮助下，立即举办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席最新指示为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线。在提高两条路线斗争觉悟的基础上，修改了原订的招生方案，决定为工农兵敞开学校大门，全部招收有实践经验的工人、农民和复员军人入学。
    招生工作一开始，就在校革委会的领导下，组成了六个由校革委会成员、革命师生代表、驻校解放军参加的三结合招生小组，深入农村，从调查研究入手，和贫下中农一起大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的修正主义教育路线。不少贫下中农气愤地控诉说：过去中国赫鲁晓夫搞的什么入学考试关、升级关、毕业关，这关那关，都是为了把贫下中农子女关在门外。中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人为了培养修正主义苗子，还说什么“师范生，将来是当老师的，得说话文明，容貌好看，五官、体态端正。”他们这一套认分不认人、认人不认阶级的修正主义招生制度，我们恨透了！广大贫下中农对反革命修正主义教育路线的控诉，大大提高了招生小组人员的觉悟，他们决心进行彻底革命，把录取学生的大权交给贫下中农，采取领导与群众相结合、推荐与选拔相结合的崭新招生制度。由贫下中农选拔出他们最信得过的人，经招生小组审查后，报上级批准。
    在选拔学生的条件上，邢台师范学校招生小组彻底打破了非初中毕业生不得录取的旧框框，把政治标准放在第一位，挑选经过三大革命运动实践锻炼、家庭出身好、政治表现好、在无产阶级文化大革命中立场坚定、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的贫下中农、在乡知识青年和复员军人入学。学校根据新生的经历、文化程度等情况，把学制由三年分别缩短为一年、两年。为了确保新生的政治质量，招生小组运用解放军征招新兵的办法，深入农村紧密配合贫下中农选拔学生。
    由于坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，贫下中农牢牢掌握了推荐和选拔学生的大权，邢台师范学校这次招收的六百名新生中，贫下中农出身的占百分之九十以上，他们中有不少人是活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，优秀的共产党员、共青团员、生产队干部、复员军人、革命造反派战士。他们普遍从事过三年以上的生产劳动，有的劳动过七八年。师范学校招收了这样一批新生，广大贫下中农感到十分高兴。新生入学时，不少村庄的贫下中农敲锣打鼓，热情欢送，再三嘱咐他们入学后不要丢掉贫下中农艰苦朴素的好传统，不要丢掉锄头和镐头；毕业后不要忘记回农村为贫下中农服务。
    这批新生一进学校，刚放下背包就向毛主席宣誓：永远保持贫下中农本色，决心在工人阶级领导下，在学校里打好斗、批、改这一仗，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。在学校里，他们积极参加对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的革命大批判，和进驻学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志亲如兄弟，经常一起讨论如何搞好学校的教育革命。他们入校不久，就对搞好学校的斗、批、改提出了许多好建议。工人宣传队的同志称赞他们是“学校的顶梁柱，斗、批、改的主力军，宣传队的好帮手。”
    这批新生的入学，也为原来在校的师生和干部提供了接受再教育的好教员。这些贫下中农青年都具有无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，理论联系实际、学用一致的好学风和艰苦朴素的优良品质。一部分复员军人入学后，把解放军的优良传统和政治工作经验也带进了学校。现在，邢台师范学校的政治空气搞得浓浓的，各方面的工作都出现一派朝气勃勃的大好景象。
