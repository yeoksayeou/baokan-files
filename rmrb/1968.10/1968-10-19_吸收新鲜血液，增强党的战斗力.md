Title: Absorbing Fresh Blood to Strengthen the Party's Combat Effectiveness

Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "A person has arteries, veins, and blood circulation through the heart, and also breathes through the lungs, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without removing waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lose its vitality," has reached the Daqing Oilfield. We are immensely joyful and deeply moved. Chairman Mao's latest instruction speaks the heart of the working class. With boundless respect, we shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

Chairman Mao's latest instruction is the great program for the proletarian party rectification and construction. By following Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, we will definitely build our party organizations at all levels into "vanguard organizations that lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy, full of vigor and vitality," and ensure that our party always remains red.

Within our party, there has always been a struggle between two party-building lines. Chairman Mao's party-building line is the lifeline of our party. However, Liu Shaoqi, in order to restore capitalism in China, promoted a revisionist party-building line to oppose Chairman Mao's party-building line. The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, led by Liu Shaoqi, are terrified and hateful of Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line. Since 1962, they have repeatedly visited Daqing, peddling a whole set of revisionist goods such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of the tame tool." They maliciously claimed, "Your Daqing is different from other places; class struggle is not the main contradiction for you." The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Daqing party followed their black master, saying that in "extraordinary times," the party should adopt "extraordinary measures," "collective development," and "rapid development." They colluded with traitors, spies, reactionary "technical authorities," and remnants of the Kuomintang, trying every means to bring them into the party and give them leadership positions. They relied on the bourgeoisie to seize power from the working class. There was a bourgeois intellectual in the Drilling Command who had always opposed the proletarian revolution, but the capitalist-roaders in Daqing insisted on bringing him into the party. We Daqing workers firmly opposed this, but the capitalist-roader argued, "He can be an engineer, so why can't he be a Communist Party member?" At that time, we workers were so angry that we almost burst with rage. They promoted the revisionist party-building line, advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," obscuring class struggle, suppressing the laboring masses, and attempting to turn the proletarian party into a revisionist "people's party" and a fascist party, aiming to achieve their dream of restoring capitalism in China.

Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Daqing also vigorously promoted the black "Self-Cultivation," advocating the "theory of the tame tool." Their malicious intent was to obscure the revolutionary vigor of Communist Party members, making us "cultivate" into bourgeois elements who forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat and class struggle. They disguised themselves as the embodiment of the party, demanding absolute obedience from party members. Those who listened to them were called "good party members" and "good cadres," while those who did not were subjected to attacks. They even blatantly said, "If you don't listen to me, I will dismiss you from your post and remove you from your position." We must denounce the reactionary "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of the tame tool" to make party members full of vigor and strengthen the combat effectiveness of party members and their thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Where does our power come from? It comes from the working class, from the poor and lower-middle peasants, from the broad laboring masses who make up more than ninety percent of the population. We represent the proletariat, represent the people, overthrow the people's enemies, and the people support us. The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to directly rely on the broad revolutionary masses."

Our party rectification must rely on the masses and conduct open-door rectification. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented large-scale open-door party rectification movement. Only by implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, conducting a mass rather than a closed-door party rectification movement, absorbing those who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, firmly carry out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, and charge into the forefront of class struggle and production struggle as proletarian rebels; selecting outstanding Communist Party members to participate in the leadership of party organizations at all levels; and resolutely removing waste, can we do a good job in party rectification and construction.

Over the past two years, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "be willing to be a small student," I often go to the well sites, construction sites, and work with the masses to study Chairman Mao's works, labor together, and conduct joint criticism and struggle. I constantly expose my shortcomings, fight against them, absorb nutrients from the masses, strengthen my ideological revolutionization, continuously improve my awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and deepen my understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. When the Revolutionary Committee of Daqing was established, the masses again promoted me to a leadership position. In this great revolutionary movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and in the struggle of party rectification, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great instruction of "facing the wind and rain, seeing the world," firmly stand on the proletarian revolutionary line, not for a moment leaving the laboring masses, be a genuine Communist Party member, and resolve to be a faithful servant of the revolutionary people for life.

    吸收新鲜血液，增强党的战斗力
    全国劳动模范、大庆革命委员会副主任　王进喜
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席关于“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气”的最新指示传到大庆油田以后，我们无比欢欣鼓舞，心情万分激动。毛主席的最新指示，说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。我们怀着无限崇敬的心情，千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席的最新指示，是无产阶级整党、建党的伟大纲领。沿着毛主席的无产阶级的建党路线前进，就一定能够把我们各级党组织建设成为“领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”，就一定能够保证我们党永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    我们党内向来存在着两条建党路线的斗争。毛主席的建党路线，是我们党的生命。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫为了在中国复辟资本主义，推行一条修正主义的建党路线，同毛主席的建党路线相对抗。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对毛主席的无产阶级建党路线怕得要死，恨得要命。一九六二年以来，他们几次溜到大庆，极力兜售“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“驯服工具论”等一整套修正主义黑货。他们别有用心地胡说什么：“你们大庆和别的地方不同，阶级斗争对于你们来说不是主要矛盾”。大庆地区党内一小撮走资派，紧跟他们的黑主子，说什么“非常时期”，党要采取“非常手段”“集体发展”、“突击发展”。他们招降纳叛，结党营私，千方百计把一些叛徒、特务、反动技术“权威”和国民党的残渣余孽拉入党内，并让他们攫取领导职位。他们依靠资产阶级来专我们工人阶级的政。钻井指挥部有个资产阶级知识分子，一贯反对无产阶级革命，但是大庆的走资派非要把他拉到党内来不可。我们大庆工人阶级坚决反对，这个走资派反而诡辩说：“他能当工程师，还不能当个共产党员？”当时，我们工人的肺都快要气炸了。他们推行修正主义建党路线，宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，抹杀阶级斗争，镇压劳动群众，就是企图把无产阶级政党搞成修正主义的“全民党”，法西斯党，企图达到他们在中国复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在大庆的代理人，还极力推销黑《修养》，宣扬“驯服工具论”。其恶毒用心就是要抹杀共产党员生气勃勃的革命朝气，让我们“修养”成忘记无产阶级专政，忘记阶级斗争的资产阶级分子。他们把自己打扮成党的化身，要党员绝对听话，绝对服从。听他们的话，就是“好党员”，“好干部”，不听他们的话，就要受到打击。他们还明目张胆地说：“不听我的话，我就罢你的官，撤你的职。”我们只有批臭反动的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“驯服工具论”，才能使党员朝气蓬勃，加强党员的战斗力，增强党员的无产阶级的彻底革命性。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的权力是谁给的？是工人阶级给的，是贫下中农给的，是占人口百分之九十以上的广大劳动群众给的。我们代表了无产阶级，代表了人民群众，打倒了人民的敌人，人民就拥护我们。共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”
    我们整党就是要依靠群众，进行开门整党。无产阶级文化大革命运动，就是一场空前规模的开门整党运动。只有执行毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，进行群众性的而不是关门的整党运动，吸收那些无限忠于毛主席，坚决贯彻无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，在阶级斗争、生产斗争中冲锋陷阵的无产阶级造反派战士入党；选拔优秀的共产党员参加各级党组织的领导工作；并且坚决排除废料，这样才能把整党建党工作搞好。
    两年来，我遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“甘当小学生”的教导，经常到井场、工地和群众共同学习毛主席著作、共同劳动、共同进行大批判，不断地亮私、斗私，从群众中吸收营养，加强思想革命化，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，对毛主席的革命路线有了比较深刻的认识，对在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论加深了理解。大庆成立革委会时，群众又把我提上领导岗位。在这次斗、批、改的伟大革命运动中，在整党的斗争中，我一定要遵循毛主席关于“经风雨，见世面”的伟大教导，坚定地站在无产阶级革命路线上，一时一刻也不脱离劳动群众，做一个名副其实的共产党员，并且决心做一辈子革命人民的忠实勤务员。
