A worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda squad, together with PLA soldiers, entered the Guilin City Workers' Hospital. They followed Chairman Mao's great directive to "fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work," and held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the hospital. They focused on the struggle between the two lines, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything and transform everything.

For a long time, the Workers' Hospital had been poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line of China's Khrushchev. Many medical staff were only skilled but not red, putting technique first. The operating table became a place for competing for fame and profit, and for practicing techniques; in the wards, workers and poor and lower-middle peasants did not receive proper care and were subjected to various difficulties. In short, they did not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda squad, in response to these problems, decided to address the issue of "for whom the hospital serves." First, they organized various departments to hold different types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying Chairman Mao's instructions on medical and health care and the "Three Old Articles," visiting class struggle exhibitions, and mobilizing the masses to fiercely criticize and expose China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the medical and health field. They laid bare the manifestations of class struggle and exposed the cover of class struggle. Old workers also recounted their bitter experiences in the old society, where their own flesh and blood died in front of the hospital because they couldn't afford treatment. In the study classes, the class consciousness and two-line struggle awareness of the revolutionary masses were raised. Some doctors said: China's Khrushchev has harmed us, making us detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, not caring about their sufferings, and falling into the pit of competing for fame and profit. We eat and wear what the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants provide, but we have not served them well. We are truly sorry to them and to Chairman Mao. Some nurses said: The counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line has made us lose our proletarian stance and feelings, leading us to make mistakes. Today, the working class has pulled us back from the brink of danger. In the future, we will definitely take the working class as an example, read Chairman Mao's books for life, walk the revolutionary path for life, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life.

The radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the hearts of the medical staff, showing them the way forward. Under the leadership of the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda squad, all hospital staff followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Many medical staff posted big-character posters saying, "Accept re-education from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and become doctors welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." The outpatient department issued notices to facilitate workers and poor and lower-middle peasants in seeing doctors. The medical staff decided to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, taking the three shining examples in the "Three Old Articles" as models, and wholeheartedly serving the people. The entire hospital presented an unprecedented new situation.

    工人宣传队使工人医院换新貌
    一支工人毛泽东思想宣传队，配合解放军战士，开进桂林市工人医院。他们遵照毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的伟大教导，在全院大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓两条路线的斗争，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切。
    长期以来，工人医院在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线的毒害下，不少医护人员只专不红，技术第一。手术台成了争名争利、练技术的地方；在病房，工人和贫下中农病人得不到应有的护理，还受到百般刁难。一句话，就是不为工农兵服务。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队针对这些情况，决心解决工人医院“为谁开门”的问题。首先组织各科室举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席有关医疗卫生方面的教导和“老三篇”，参观阶级斗争展览，深入发动群众狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫在医疗卫生战线上顽固推行的反革命修正主义路线，大摆阶级斗争的表现，大揭阶级斗争的盖子。老工人还讲述了在旧社会自己亲骨肉因无钱治病而死在医院门前的悲惨遭遇。在学习班里，广大革命群众的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟提高了。有的医生说：中国赫鲁晓夫害苦了我们，使我们脱离工农兵，不关心工农兵疾苦，陷入争名争利的泥坑。我们吃的穿的是工人、贫下中农给的，我们却没有很好地为他们服务，真对不起他们，对不起毛主席。有的护士说：反革命修正主义的医疗卫生路线，使我们丢掉了无产阶级的立场和感情，以致犯了错误。今天是工人阶级把我们从危险的边缘拉了回来，今后一定以工人阶级为榜样，读一辈子毛主席的书，走一辈子革命的路，为工农兵服务一辈子。
    毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光照亮了医护人员的心，给他们指明了前进方向。在工人毛泽东思想宣传队领导下，全院人员紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。许多医护人员贴出了“接受工农兵再教育，做工农兵欢迎的医生”的大字报；门诊室发出了方便工人、贫下中农看病的通告。医护人员决心遵照毛主席的教导，以“老三篇”中的三个光辉形象为榜样，全心全意为人民服务。全院呈现出前所未有的新局面。
