	Our great socialist motherland—the People's Republic of China—has been established for nineteen years!

	We celebrate our glorious national day amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, feeling immensely exhilarated.

	On behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, I extend the warmest congratulations and proletarian combat greetings to the responsible comrades of the revolutionary committees of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, to the worker representatives, poor and lower-middle peasant representatives, People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals present here, and to the compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao and overseas Chinese!

	We are delighted that, together with us in celebrating our great national day, are the heroic people of Albania, headed by Comrade Bekir Balluku, the Pakistani government friendly delegation headed by His Excellency Sayyid Fida Hassan, our comrades from the anti-U.S. frontlines of Vietnam and Laos, and comrades and friends from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other continents. We extend to them our warmest welcome.

	Comrades and friends: One year ago, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is in an excellent situation, not just a good situation. 'In a few more months, the situation will be even better.'" The development of the revolution has fully proved Chairman Mao's brilliant foresight.

	The bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev has been thoroughly smashed. Revolutionary committees have been established throughout the country, with the exception of Taiwan Province, in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Our proletarian dictatorship has never been as consolidated as it is today. Our socialist motherland has never been as strong as it is today.

	This is the great victory of the people of all nationalities in our country, who have closely united around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and fought heroically! This is the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

	Now, the people throughout the country are high-spirited and full of vigor, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and are launching a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the country. The working class is enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, cooperating with the People's Liberation Army, and is now taking the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in all spheres of the superstructure to fulfill the great historical mission of the working class leading everything. At present, the educational revolution is underway, and old and new intellectuals are being re-educated and are taking the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The day of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not far off!

	The imperialists and modern revisionists have tried to achieve "peaceful evolution" in China and restore capitalism. Their conspiracy has been ruthlessly smashed.

	Comrades and friends: The current international situation is also excellent. The storm of people's revolution is fiercely sweeping the entire old world. U.S. imperialism is being beaten to a standstill on the battlefield in Vietnam. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's invasion of Czechoslovakia has declared the complete bankruptcy of modern revisionism. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are vying with each other and colluding with each other, attempting to divide spheres of influence and redivide the world, and to extinguish the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries. But the more frantically they counterattack, the more they will promote the revolutionary awakening of the peoples of the world. A new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun. We must smash the evil conspiracy of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists to divide the world! The revolutionary peoples of the world must unite more closely to advance bravely and fight against the aggression, control, enslavement, and threats of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism! Victory will definitely belong to the revolutionary peoples!

	We firmly support the revolutionary actions of the Albanian people in withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact and their heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. We will forever stand together with the fraternal Albanian people, fight together, and win together.

	We firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying the great war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end.

	We firmly support the struggle of the Czechoslovakian people and the peoples of other Eastern European countries against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist renegade clique.

	We firmly support the armed struggle of the Arab people against U.S.-Israeli aggression.

	We firmly support the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries of the world against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys.

	We firmly support the struggle of the peoples of Western Europe, North America, and Oceania against the rule of U.S. imperialism and their own monopolies.

	We must liberate Taiwan.

	Comrades and friends: The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are capable of anything. We must heighten our vigilance, strengthen our preparedness, and be ready at any time to smash the aggression of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys, whether acting alone or in collusion. If any enemy dares to invade our great motherland, the 700 million Chinese people, tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely and thoroughly annihilate them.

	Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

	Long live Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live the great unity of the revolutionary peoples of the world!

	Long live the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries!

	Long live the great People's Republic of China!

	Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

	Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年招待会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    同志们，朋友们：
    我们伟大的社会主义祖国——中华人民共和国，成立十九周年了！
    我们在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，欢庆我们的光辉节日，感到无比的兴奋。
    我代表我们的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，代表中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革，向在座的各省、市、自治区革命委员会的负责同志、工人代表、贫下中农代表、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，向在座的港澳同胞和海外侨胞，致以最热烈的祝贺和无产阶级的战斗敬礼！
    我们感到高兴的是，同我们一起欢度我们伟大节日的，还有英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者、以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，有以赛义德·菲达·哈桑阁下为首的巴基斯坦政府友好代表团，有来自抗美前线的越南和老挝的战友们，有亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和其他各洲的同志们和朋友们。我们向他们表示最热烈的欢迎。
    同志们，朋友们：一年以前，伟大领袖毛主席指出：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。”“再有几个月的时间，整个形势将会变得更好。”革命的发展，完全证实了毛主席的这一英明预见。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，被彻底打垮了。新生的革命委员会在全国除台湾省以外的二十九个省、市、自治区，全部成立起来了。我们的无产阶级专政从来没有象现在这样巩固。我们的社会主义祖国从来没有象现在这样强大。
    这是我国各族人民，紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，英勇奋斗的伟大胜利！这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    现在，全国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，斗志昂扬，意气风发，正在全国范围内掀起一个斗、批、改的新高潮。工人阶级热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，配合解放军，正在登上上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台，执行“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大历史使命。目前，教育革命正在进行，新旧知识分子正在接受再教育，走与工农兵相结合的道路。无产阶级文化大革命取得全面胜利的日子，已经不远了！
    帝国主义、现代修正主义妄想在中国实现“和平演变”，复辟资本主义。它们这种阴谋已被无情地粉碎了。
    同志们，朋友们：目前国际形势也是一片大好。人民革命的风暴猛烈地冲击着整个旧世界。美帝国主义在越南战场上被打得走投无路。苏修叛徒集团对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，宣告了现代修正主义的总破产。美帝、苏修之间互相争夺而又互相勾结，妄图划分势力范围、重新瓜分世界，扑灭各国人民的革命运动。但是，它们越是疯狂反扑，就越会促进世界人民的革命觉醒。一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经开始。我们一定要粉碎美帝、苏修瓜分世界的罪恶阴谋！全世界革命人民进一步团结起来，为反对美帝、苏修的侵略、控制、奴役和威胁而奋勇前进！胜利一定是属于革命人民的！
    我们坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民退出华沙条约的革命行动和反对美帝、苏修的英勇斗争。我们永远和兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    我们坚决支持英雄的越南人民把伟大的抗美救国战争进行到底。
    我们坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民和东欧各国人民反对以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的正义斗争。
    我们坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对美、以侵略的武装斗争。
    我们坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民反对美帝、苏修及其走狗的斗争。
    我们坚决支持西欧、北美和大洋洲各国人民反对美帝和本国垄断资本统治的斗争。
    我们一定要解放台湾。
    同志们，朋友们：美帝、苏修是什么事情都干得出来的。我们一定要提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备粉碎美帝、苏修及其走狗单独的或联合的侵犯。任何敌人胆敢侵犯我们伟大的祖国，在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民，就一定坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭他们。
    无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
    世界革命人民大团结万岁！
    世界各国人民革命斗争胜利万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
