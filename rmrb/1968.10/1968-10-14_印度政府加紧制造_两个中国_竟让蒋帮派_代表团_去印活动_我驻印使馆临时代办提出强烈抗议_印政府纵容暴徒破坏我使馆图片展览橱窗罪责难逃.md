The Indian government is hurrying to create "two Chinas" and has allowed the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "delegation" to act in India. The Chinese chargé d'affaires in India, Chen Zhaoyuan, has lodged a strong protest with the Indian government over this serious incident. The Indian government's tolerance of hooligans who destroyed the picture exhibition window of the Chinese embassy is inexcusable.

New Delhi, October 12 (Xinhua) — Recently, the Indian reactionary government openly allowed the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is holed up in Taiwan, to send a "delegation" to India to participate in the centenary celebrations of Gandhi's birth. This is another serious crime committed by the Indian reactionary government in collusion with U.S. imperialism to create "two Chinas."

On September 30, the Chinese chargé d'affaires in India, Chen Zhaoyuan, lodged a strong protest with the Indian government over this serious incident. He solemnly pointed out that in August, the Chinese embassy had already lodged a strong protest with the Indian government over the incident in which the Indian Minister of Education referred to the Chiang clique as the "Republic of China." Currently, the Chiang clique's "delegation" participating in the Gandhi centenary celebrations is an even more serious incident. This is a serious provocation by the Indian government against the Chinese people.

The "delegation" sent by the Chiang clique to India has been closely colluding with the Indian reactionary government and engaging in conspiratorial activities. According to Indian newspapers, in addition to openly participating in the official activities organized by the Indian government to commemorate Gandhi's birth, the "delegation" also "exchanged views with Indian leaders" to promote "closer understanding" between the two sides.

Recently, the collusion between the Indian reactionaries and the Chiang Kai-shek clique has become increasingly close and public. According to the Indian "Forum Report," the Chiang clique members who participated in the so-called "Asian Science and Technology Conference" in India in August this year said after returning to Taiwan that the Chiang clique and the Indian reactionary government are preparing to formulate a plan to exchange professors and students as the first step in "cultural exchange." Subsequently, on September 16, 125 Indian reactionary parliamentarians, with the tacit approval of the Indian reactionary government, demanded the severance of diplomatic relations with China. This action, taken under the approval of the Indian reactionary government, was applauded by the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The Indian reactionary government recently shamelessly expressed its desire to "improve relations with China" and "resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries." In reality, it is creating "two Chinas" under the orders of U.S. imperialism. This shows that this reactionary government is extremely hypocritical. It is a faithful running dog of U.S. imperialism.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on September 26, the Indian government once again allowed hooligans to destroy the picture exhibition window of the Chinese embassy in India. This is another serious provocation by the Indian government, deliberately disrupting the normal activities of the Chinese embassy and infringing upon diplomatic privileges.

On the evening of September 26, the picture exhibition window of the Chinese embassy in India was attacked by hooligans. They smashed four large glass panels of the window and pierced the photo boards with sticks. The photos on display at the time included photos of people in some Asian and African countries studying Chairman Mao's works, photos of President Nyerere's visit to China, and photos of Chinese technicians working in Africa.

On September 27, the Chinese chargé d'affaires in India, Chen Zhaoyuan, summoned the East Asia Department Director of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singh, to lodge a serious protest over this serious provocation. He demanded that the Indian government seriously handle this incident, punish the relevant perpetrators, compensate for the losses, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

It must be pointed out that this incident was instigated by the Indian government, and it is another new crime committed by the Indian government in its persistent hostility towards China and deliberate disruption of relations between the two countries. The Indian government's attempt to shirk responsibility is futile.

    印度政府加紧制造“两个中国”竟让蒋帮派“代表团”去印活动
    我驻印使馆临时代办提出强烈抗议
    印政府纵容暴徒破坏我使馆图片展览橱窗罪责难逃
    新华社十二日讯　新德里消息：最近，印度反动政府公然允许盘踞在台湾的蒋介石匪帮派“代表团”去印度参加甘地诞辰一百周年纪念活动。这是印度反动政府在美帝国主义的指使下加紧制造“两个中国”的又一严重罪行。
    中国驻印度大使馆临时代办陈肇源，九月三十日就这个严重事件向印度政府提出了强烈抗议。他严正指出，八月间，中国大使馆已经就印度教育国务部长把蒋匪帮称作什么“中华民国”的事件，向印度政府提出过强烈抗议。目前，蒋帮“代表团”参加甘地诞辰纪念活动，是更加严重的事件。这是印度政府对中国人民的严重挑衅。
    蒋匪帮派去印度的这个“代表团”到印度后，同印度反动政府紧紧勾结，进行阴谋活动。据印度报纸报道，这个“代表团”除了公开参加印度政府组织的纪念甘地诞辰的官方活动外，还“同印度领导人交换意见”，以便促进双方“更密切的了解”。
    近来，印度反动派和蒋介石匪帮的勾搭越来越紧密和公开化。据印度《论坛报》透露，曾于今年八月间到印度参加所谓“亚洲科学技术会议”的蒋帮分子回到台湾以后说，蒋帮和印度反动政府准备制订一个交换教授、学生的计划，作为双方“文化交流”的第一步。随后，九月十六日，印度一百二十五名反动议员要求同中国断绝外交关系，这个在印度反动政府默许下采取的行动，得到了蒋介石匪帮的喝采。
    印度反动政府不久以前恬不知耻地表示要“改善同中国的关系”，“解决两国之间悬而未决的问题”。实际上，它在美帝的指使下，加紧制造“两个中国”。这就表明，这个反动政府是极其虚伪的。它是美帝国主义的忠实走狗。
    据新华社讯　印度政府九月二十六日又一次纵容暴徒破坏中国驻印度大使馆新闻图片展览橱窗，这是印度政府蓄意破坏我使馆正常活动、侵犯外交特权的又一个严重挑衅事件。
    九月二十六日晚，中国驻印度大使馆新闻图片展览橱窗遭到暴徒袭击。暴徒们打破了橱窗的四块大玻璃，用棍棒戳破了张贴照片的纸板。当时在橱窗里展出的有亚非一些国家人民学习毛主席著作的照片，尼雷尔总统访华的照片和中国技术人员在非洲工作的照片。
    中国驻印度大使馆临时代办陈肇源二十七日就这一严重挑衅事件约见印度外交部东亚司司长辛格，向印度政府提出严重抗议，要求印度政府严肃处理这一事件，惩办有关肇事人员，赔偿损失，并且保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    必须指出，这次事件是印度政府怂恿暴徒干出来的，是它坚持敌视中国、蓄意破坏两国关系的又一新罪行。印度政府妄图推卸罪责是办不到的。
