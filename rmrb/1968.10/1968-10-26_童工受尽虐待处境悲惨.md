The Krasnoye Polyanino Bread Factory in the Moscow region hired over thirty child laborers this summer. None of them were sixteen years old.

As soon as the children entered the factory, the foreman ordered them, "You will work the night shift tomorrow."

Night shifts are much harder than day shifts. In the summer, the children had to work for long periods next to huge, red-hot furnaces, making it difficult to breathe. The scorching molds burned blisters on the children's skin. These poor children endured a whole night in such harsh conditions, their eyes red from the strain.

Zavolokin's pants and shirt were torn on his first day. When he stammered out a request for work clothes, the factory director flew into a rage, saying that child laborers do not get work clothes. Director Tabachnikov was tyrannical and brutal, often insulting workers and shouting at the child laborers.

The factory's chief mechanic, the alcoholic Samyatov, treated the child laborers just as badly as the director. Once, Samyatov ordered the children to fill a cart with cement. Three children carried two and a half tons of cement, while Samyatov and some others went to "have a drink." They returned drunk only after the work was done.

The factory's workers were outraged by the director's mistreatment of the child laborers. Young electrician Borovikov criticized the director for his brutal attitude towards the children and for the factory not having a special committee for youth work. Who would have thought that because of this, he was fired. The director, in front of everyone, thundered, "You, Borovikov, are about to graduate from a technical school. We don't need such high-level electricians. Go find work elsewhere."

Immediately, the factory's trade union committee made a decision: "The factory committee agrees to fire electrician Borovikov. There is no possibility of using Borovikov in production because he is a high-level specialist."

And that's not all. The factory also found ways to illegally deduct the child laborers' wages. Once, the children discovered that the foreman had recorded only four hours of work on their time sheets each day.

The children were surprised. They knew they worked all night. Everyone knew this. Why did the foreman only calculate their wages for four hours? But the children dared not speak up, and neither did the factory workers. Because everyone knew the consequences. Wasn't young electrician Borovikov a case in point?

    童工受尽虐待处境悲惨
    劳动条件十分恶劣　工资还被非法克扣
    厂长领班凶如虎狼　满腹怨苦无处申诉
    莫斯科州红色波利扬纳面包厂在今年夏天雇了三十多名童工。他们都没满十六岁。
    孩子们一进工厂，领班就对他们下命令：“明天你们上夜班。”
    夜间工作要比白天辛苦得多。夏天，孩子们长时间地在巨大的烧红了的炉子旁劳动，呼吸都感到困难。灼热的模子，把孩子们的皮肤上烫起了水泡。这些可怜的孩子在恶劣的条件下熬了一整夜，眼睛都发红了。
    扎沃洛金第一天就把裤子和衬衣弄破了，当他结结巴巴地申请工作服的时候，厂长发脾气说，童工们不发工作服。厂长塔巴奇尼科夫作威作福，粗暴凶狠，他随便侮辱工人，对童工更是经常大声叱责。
    工厂的总机械师、酒鬼萨米亚托夫对童工的态度也和厂长一样。有一次，萨米亚托夫命令孩子们装满满的一车水泥。三个孩子搬了两吨半水泥，而萨米亚托夫和一些人这个时候却去“喝三杯”去了。等到工作干完了，他们才醉醺醺地回来。
    工厂的广大工人对厂长等虐待童工非常气愤。青年电气钳工鲍罗维科夫批评厂长对童工采取粗暴态度，批评工厂里没有一个做少年工作的专门委员会。谁知道，就因为这件事，他竟被厂里解雇了。厂长当着大家气势汹汹地说：“你，鲍罗维科夫，中等技术学校快毕业了，我们不需要这样高水平钳工，你到别处找工作去吧”。
    于是，工会工厂委员会马上作出决定：“工厂委员会同意解雇电气钳工鲍罗维科夫。没有可能在生产上使用鲍罗维科夫，因为他是高水平的专家”。
    这还不算，工厂还想方设法克扣童工的工资。有一次，孩子们发现，领班在他们的工作表上登记的每天劳动时间，经常只是四小时。
    孩子们很吃惊，他们每天都是整夜工作。这是人所共知的。为什么领班只按四小时给他们计算工资呢！但是，孩子们不敢提意见，工厂的工人也不敢提意见。因为，大家知道这样做了会有什么后果。青年钳工鲍罗维科夫不是一个先例吗？
