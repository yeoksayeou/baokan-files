The working class in Hunan, inspired by the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work," has since August dispatched batches of workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. These teams have gone to various domains of the superstructure and other units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not been well carried out, to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of workers have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focused on class struggle, and in over a month, have rapidly changed the face of a number of "persistent difficulties" units.

After entering various domains of the superstructure, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of workers have vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the battle cries of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize and arm the masses. In Changsha City's No. 16 Middle School, which had long been disrupted by class enemies, internal strife was rampant. After the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of workers entered the school, they deeply propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the revolutionary teachers and students, patiently did ideological and political work, quickly raised the consciousness of the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students, helped them see clearly, exposed the class enemies who disrupted the school's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, quickly achieved revolutionary great alliance, and established a revolutionary committee. Now, this school is bustling with the fervor of resuming classes and making revolution. The workers' propaganda teams that entered Changsha City's No. 1 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, No. 5 Middle School, and other schools, through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carrying out heart-to-heart talks, and conducting home visits, propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation in these units.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of workers that entered some "persistent difficulties" units in Changsha City, Zhuzhou City, and Chenzhou, Hengyang, Changde, and Yueyang prefectures and counties, have, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, focused on class struggle. They have fully mobilized the masses, steadily, accurately, and fiercely struck a small handful of class enemies, greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat, and greatly dampened the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, effectively consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the struggle, the workers' propaganda teams paid attention to handing over the party's policies to the masses, strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, and to the greatest extent possible, united and won over the masses, isolating the class enemies. The faces of many "persistent difficulties" units have rapidly changed.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of workers in various places in Hunan place great importance on influencing and inspiring the broad revolutionary masses with their model actions. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of workers that entered Hunan University carried out activities within the team to learn from the People's Liberation Army and to revolutionize their thinking. Their actions inspired the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the school. After the workers' propaganda team entered the school, the school's face was completely renewed. Now, from the office buildings to the staff quarters, everywhere is filled with a vigorous revolutionary scene.

    湖南省工人阶级充分发挥领导作用
    进驻上层建筑领域的工人宣传队，认真落实毛主席最新指示，使一批“老大难”单位迅速改变了面貌
    据新华社长沙二十四日电　在伟大领袖毛主席关于“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示鼓舞下，湖南省工人阶级，从八月份以来，接连派出大批工人，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，分赴上层建筑各个领域和其他没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，领导斗、批、改。工人毛泽东思想宣传队认真落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，一个多月来，已使一批“老大难”单位迅速改变了面貌。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上层建筑各个领域后，大力宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想发动群众，武装群众。长沙市十六中，过去由于阶级敌人的捣乱破坏，长期“内战”不休。工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校后，深入到广大革命师生中宣传毛主席的最新指示，耐心地做思想政治工作，使全校革命师生很快提高了觉悟，擦亮了眼睛，揪出了破坏学校无产阶级文化大革命的阶级敌人，很快实现了革命大联合，成立了革命委员会。现在，这个学校复课闹革命搞得热气腾腾。进驻长沙市一中、三中、五中等学校的工人宣传队，通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，开展谈心活动，以及进行家庭访问等方式，宣传、落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，推动了这些单位的斗、批、改。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”进驻一些“老大难”单位的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导，狠抓阶级斗争。进驻长沙市、株洲市和郴州、衡阳、常德、岳阳等专区、县的一些“老大难”单位的工人毛泽东思想宣传队以阶级斗争为纲，充分发动群众，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，有力地巩固了无产阶级专政。在斗争中，工人宣传队注意把党的政策交给群众，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，最大限度地团结和争取了群众，孤立了阶级敌人。许多“老大难”单位的面貌迅速改观。
    湖南各地工人毛泽东思想宣传队十分重视以自己的模范行动影响和带动广大革命群众。进驻湖南大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队在宣传队内部开展了向解放军学习，搞好思想革命化的活动。他们的行动带动了学校的革命师生员工。工人宣传队进校后，这个学校的面貌焕然一新。现在，校内从办公楼到家属区，到处是朝气蓬勃的革命景象。
