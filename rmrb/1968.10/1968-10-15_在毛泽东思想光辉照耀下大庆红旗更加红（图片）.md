The heroic workers of Daqing and the broad revolutionary masses have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have achieved tremendous victories in both revolution and production. Since this year, the entire oil field has completed and exceeded the state's monthly plans for crude oil production, processing, and transportation. The daily crude oil production has surpassed the highest level of previous years. The image shows a large amount of crude oil ready for transportation.

	The workers of Daqing's 1268 Drilling Team and the People's Liberation Army, who are supporting the left, are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and the joy of victory. They sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life! Long live Chairman Mao!
