Some Egyptian friends and other Arab friends recently wrote to Chinese friends, warmly congratulating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and enthusiastically expressing their admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

An Egyptian friend from Alexandria, Ahmad, wrote in his letter: "The great Chinese people have always stood on the side of the Arab people in our struggle against Israeli aggression, in our struggle to recover lost territories and liberate Palestine. The Chinese people have always been the trusted friends of the Arab people."

A friend from the industrial city of Mahalla Kubra in the Nile Delta, Mustafa Hussein, wrote: "I admire the great Chinese people. I also sincerely thank the spirited Chinese people for their consistent and powerful support for our people's struggle against brutal aggression. We will always remember the true friendship of the Chinese people towards the Arab people. For us, glorious China is a brilliant beacon lighting our path to national freedom."

A student from Cairo University, Abdul, wrote: "We are happy to see that under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have achieved countless successes in economic construction and socialist revolution. Revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (except Taiwan Province) throughout China. Now, the whole country is red, which is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, the guiding light for the revolutionary people of the world."

A middle school student in Cairo drew a portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform and wrote: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live the eternal friendship between the Arab people and the Chinese people!"
