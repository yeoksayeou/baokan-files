On the occasion of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I once again stood on the majestic Tiananmen Gate, saw our great leader Chairman Mao, and listened to the National Day speech by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms. I was greatly inspired and educated! With immense excitement, I shouted a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!

"The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Vice Chairman Lin's speech, representing the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and the important editorial "Advance Courageously on the Road to Victory" by the two newspapers and one journal, convey the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao. It is a great battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters to the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the country. We revolutionary fighters will respond a thousand times and execute it ten thousand times!

In this great era of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has entered the new phase of "seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation," the working class of our country, following Chairman Mao's brilliant directive that "the working class must lead everything," has sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams into primary and secondary schools and all places where intellectuals gather, leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various domains of the superstructure. This is a great strategic deployment proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao based on the summary of the masses' experiences, a great event of the 1960s, a great innovation in the history of proletarian revolution, and also the fundamental guarantee for unifying our understanding, policy, steps, and actions according to Mao Zedong Thought to achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will definitely execute it resolutely, propagate it enthusiastically, and defend it bravely!

"The working class has the greatest foresight, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." In May, our regiment entered a factory and took on the honorable tasks of guarding the factory and supporting the left. During our time with the working class, comrades further felt that the working class is the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the closest to Chairman Mao, and the most intimate with the People's Liberation Army, truly the leading class of the revolution. They immediately respond to and resolutely execute every directive and battle call from the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters. Chairman Mao called for "supporting the army and loving the people," and they immediately held meetings to support the army and love the people. The workers sent the most precious gifts to the regiment—the portrait of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's latest directives—and showed their affection for the soldiers—the carefully made "family heirloom" sewing kits. To ensure that the troops always remember Chairman Mao's teachings about "never forgetting class struggle," they also sent old workers who had suffered greatly in the old society to participate in the regiment's bitterness meetings. Together with us, they studied Chairman Mao's works, recalled bitterness and sweetness, ate bitterness meals, held criticism meetings, and encouraged us to better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve new victories for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! The workers' bitter experiences in the old society and their heartfelt words gave us a vivid lesson on class struggle and line struggle. Comrades, facing Chairman Mao's portrait, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," with boundless proletarian love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, shouted in unison: Learn from the working class! Do not forget the bitterness of class struggle, remember the blood and tears! Follow Chairman Mao and always revolutionize!

The working class must lead everything, and the working class can lead everything. The revolutionary practice of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams from the working class entering various domains of the superstructure and taking the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in many regions across the country has already proven and will continue to prove that the working class can indeed lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various domains of the superstructure. In the history of proletarian revolution, it will surely write a brilliant page of epoch-making significance.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All soldiers of our army must always remember that we are the great People's Liberation Army, the army led by the great Communist Party of China. As long as we always follow the Party's directives, we will definitely be victorious." We are full of confidence and determined to better listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's directives, firmly uphold the leadership of the working class, humbly learn from the working class, enthusiastically support all revolutionary actions of the working class, and bravely be the strong backbone of the working class. Following the victorious path indicated by Chairman Mao, we will advance courageously!

    坚决当好工人阶级的坚强后盾
    年四旺
    在举国上下欢庆中华人民共和国成立十九周年的日子里，我又一次在雄伟壮丽的天安门城楼上，见到了我们伟大领袖毛主席，并且听了毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席的国庆讲话，受到了最大的鼓舞，最大的教育！我怀着万分激动的心情，千遍万遍地纵情高呼：无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”林副主席代表以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的讲话以及两报一刊的重要社论《在胜利的大道上奋勇前进》，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，是无产阶级司令部向全国亿万军民发出的伟大战斗号召，我们革命战士一千个响应，一万个执行！
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进入了“认真搞好斗、批、改”的新时期，我国工人阶级遵照毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的光辉指示，派出工人毛泽东思想宣传队，开进大、中、小学和一切知识分子成堆的地方，领导上层建筑各个领域里的斗、批、改，这是伟大领袖毛主席总结了群众经验提出的伟大战略部署，是二十世纪六十年代的伟大事件，是无产阶级革命史上的伟大创举，也是按照毛泽东思想统一认识、统一政策、统一步伐、统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证。我们一定坚决执行，热情宣传，勇敢捍卫！
    “工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”今年五月，我们连开进了一个工厂，先后担负起护厂和支左的光荣任务。在和工人阶级相处的日子里，同志们进一步体会到：工人阶级对毛主席最忠，跟毛主席最紧，和解放军最亲，不愧为革命的领导阶级。他们对伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，都闻风而动，坚决执行。毛主席号召要“拥军爱民”，他们立即召开拥军爱民大会，工人们给连队送来了最珍贵的礼物——毛主席画像和毛主席的最新指示，送来了工人阶级对子弟兵的亲切关怀——精心制作的“传家宝”针线包。为了使部队时刻牢记毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，他们还派出在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人参加连队的忆苦会，和我们在一起学习毛主席著作，一同忆苦思甜，一同吃忆苦饭，一同开批判会，并勉励我们要更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利不断立新功！工人同志在旧社会的悲惨遭遇和语重心长的一席话，给我们上了一堂生动的阶级斗争和路线斗争的教育课。同志们面对毛主席像，手举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，同声高呼：向工人阶级学习！不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！紧跟毛主席，永远干革命！
    工人阶级必须领导一切，工人阶级能够领导一切。全国许多地区工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进上层建筑各个领域，登上斗、批、改政治舞台的革命实践，已经证明并将继续证明：工人阶级完全能够领导好上层建筑各个领域里的斗、批、改，在无产阶级革命史上必将写出划时代的光辉的一页。
    毛主席教导我们：“我全军将士必须时刻牢记，我们是伟大的人民解放军，是伟大的中国共产党领导的队伍。只要我们时刻遵守党的指示，我们就一定胜利。”我们信心百倍，决心更好地听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，坚定地维护工人阶级的领导，虚心地向工人阶级学习，热情地支持工人阶级的一切革命行动，勇敢地当好工人阶级的坚强后盾，沿着毛主席指引的胜利大道奋勇前进！
