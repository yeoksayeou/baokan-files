The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and have launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform. The revolutionary situation in the entire bureau is excellent, and transportation production has continuously set new records. The bureau's transportation plan for September was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. The average daily number of cars loaded and unloaded increased by more than seven percent compared to August and by sixty-seven percent compared to January. Technical innovation projects are also emerging continuously.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established in all units at the station and section levels within the Beijing Railway Bureau. After the establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels, they have followed Chairman Mao's teachings and implemented streamlining and efficiency. The Beijing Railway Bureau and its affiliated Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Datong sub-bureaus have streamlined a large number of administrative management personnel and transferred them to workshops and teams to strengthen the production front line.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau often organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to address the thoughts of each period, correct their understanding, and establish the correct relationship between revolution and production. They insist on leading production with revolution. Revolution promotes production. Revolutionary workers have displayed a daring spirit of innovation, carried out extensive technical innovations, and successfully tested half-conductor rail flaw detectors, automatic slope cleaning machines, combined coal unloading machines, sixty-channel microwave long-distance automatic telephones, gantry cranes, and electric coal loading machines, significantly improving work efficiency. Eighteen workers in the Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau made a large gantry crane that spans thirty meters and is thirteen meters long. Workers in a construction section successfully developed a half-conductor rail flaw detector despite the lack of technical data. Its performance surpasses the world's advanced products. The workers said: We have mastered the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and we can create any miracle in the world.

    据新华社三日讯  北京铁路局广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。目前全局革命形势大好，运输生产不断出现新纪录。这个铁路局九月份的运输计划提前超额完成，平均每日装卸车的数量比八月份提高百分之七以上，比一月份提高百分之六十七，技术革新项目也不断涌现。
    在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，北京铁路局所属站、段以上单位普遍建立了革命委员会。各级革命委员会成立以后，遵照毛主席的教导，实行了精兵简政。北京铁路局和所属北京、天津、石家庄、大同四个分局，精简了大批行政管理人员，充实到车间、班组，加强了生产第一线。
    北京铁路局广大革命职工经常针对各个时期的活思想，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，端正认识，摆好革命和生产的关系，坚持以革命统帅生产。革命促进了生产。广大革命职工发扬敢想、敢干的革命精神，大搞技术革新，试验成功了半导体钢轨探伤仪、自动边坡清筛机、联合卸煤机、六十路微波长途自动电话、龙门吊、电动上煤机等机械设备，大大提高了工作效率。石家庄铁路分局有十八个装卸工人自己动手制成了横跨三十米、身长十三米的大型龙门吊。有个工务段的革命职工在缺乏技术资料的情况下，试制成功半导体钢轨探伤仪，它的性能超过了世界上先进的产品。工人们说：我们掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹都能够创造出来。
