The San Tiao Shi Workers' Class built the San Tiao Shi Historical Museum in 1958 to reflect the workers' class history of blood and tears and their glorious struggle. The Chinese Khrushchev and Zhou Yang clique tried every means to sabotage it, insisting on using the exhibition hall to sing the praises of the bourgeoisie's rise to wealth. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers' class purged the revisionist black goods stuffed into the exhibition hall, turning the inverted history back to its rightful place, which was warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 12th: The San Tiao Shi Class Education Exhibition in the Red Bridge District of Tianjin recently officially opened.

The San Tiao Shi Class Education Exhibition was born in the midst of a fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines. As early as 1958, the San Tiao Shi workers' class, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "conduct lively and practical political education among the masses," began to establish the San Tiao Shi Historical Museum, reflecting the history of blood and tears and the glorious struggle of the San Tiao Shi workers' class. After its opening, it played a significant role in conducting class education for the broad revolutionary masses and young people, and was warmly welcomed by them. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents tried every means to sabotage this exhibition. The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Zhou Yang, in collusion with the Tianjin counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Wan Xiaotang and Zhang Huaisan, visited the museum twice, pushing the black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev's "exploitation is beneficial" theory, attempting to turn the San Tiao Shi Historical Museum into a tool for their conspiracy to restore capitalism. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang said, "We should focus more on the production development history of San Tiao Shi, so that people can understand how national industries have developed," insisting on using the exhibition to sing the praises of the evil capitalist exploitation system and the rise of the bourgeoisie. The San Tiao Shi workers' class strongly resisted their counter-revolutionary crime of distorting history.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, shattered the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents' evil conspiracy to restore capitalism. The revolutionary masses also threw all the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods stuffed into the San Tiao Shi Historical Museum by these elements into the dustbin of history.

Starting from April this year, under the leadership of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee and with the support and assistance of the stationed PLA, the museum began the work of restoring the original class education exhibition. The staff participating in the restoration work held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "exploitation is beneficial" and "class struggle is extinguished." In the process of preparing for the restoration, they widely solicited the opinions of various levels of revolutionary committees, the PLA, and revolutionary teachers and students, especially the old workers of San Tiao Shi, turning the history distorted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang and his backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, back to its rightful place, making the San Tiao Shi Exhibition Hall a bastion for promoting Mao Zedong Thought, a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, and a classroom for class education.

The contents of this exhibition include three parts: the formation of the San Tiao Shi workers' class, the history of blood and tears of the San Tiao Shi workers' class, and the struggle history of the San Tiao Shi workers' class. In the part about the formation of the San Tiao Shi workers' class, detailed charts and solid evidence materials explain that more than 95% of the San Tiao Shi workers' class came from impoverished peasants. The San Tiao Shi capitalists lived by exploiting and oppressing these laborers who had lost their means of production and had nothing. In the part about the history of blood and tears, a large number of indentured contracts, shop rules, "death bells" for oppressing and exploiting workers, "conscience tables," horsewhips, and paintings of workers' miserable experiences expose the capitalists' heinous crimes of political persecution and ruthless exploitation of workers in San Tiao Shi, powerfully refuting the Chinese Khrushchev's shameless lies about "exploitation is beneficial." The part about the struggle history enthusiastically praises the revolutionary heroism of the San Tiao Shi workers' class, who, under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, united and fought unyieldingly.

The first batch of visitors to the exhibition after its opening were the old workers of San Tiao Shi. They visited the exhibition with great excitement. Many old workers deeply felt that "seeing this exhibition, recalling the bitterness of being ruthlessly exploited and oppressed by the wicked capitalists in the old society, makes one feel even sweeter today. Truly, father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, and the most important thing is to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat." They unanimously declared: "Never forget the class bitterness, always remember the blood debt, and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution."

Many factories in San Tiao Shi organized workers to visit the San Tiao Shi Class Education Exhibition and held discussions afterward. In the discussion, they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, examined the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and decided to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice, better play the leading role of the workers' class, continuously improve their political awareness in the struggle, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    天津市三条石阶级教育展览开幕
    一九五八年，三条石工人阶级筹建了反映工人阶级血泪史和光荣斗争史的三条石历史博物馆。中国赫鲁晓夫和周扬一伙千方百计进行破坏，硬要通过展览馆去歌颂资产阶级的发家史。文化大革命中，工人阶级清除了塞进展览馆的修正主义黑货，把颠倒的历史重新颠倒过来，深受广大革命群众的欢迎
    新华社天津十二日电　天津市红桥区三条石历史博物馆阶级教育展览最近正式开幕。
    三条石阶级教育展览，是在两个阶级、两条路线激烈斗争中诞生的。早在一九五八年，三条石工人阶级遵照伟大领袖毛主席“需要在群众中间经常进行生动的、切实的政治教育”的教导，就着手筹建了反映三条石工人阶级血泪史和光荣斗争史的三条石历史博物馆。开馆后，在对广大革命群众和青少年进行阶级教育方面，起了很大作用，深受广大革命群众的欢迎。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人却千方百计地破坏这个展览。反革命修正主义分子周扬勾结天津万晓塘、张淮三反革命修正主义集团，两次来到博物馆，大肆推销中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”的黑货，妄图把三条石历史博物馆变成他们阴谋复辟资本主义的工具。反革命修正主义分子周扬胡说什么“要多搞三条石的生产发展史，叫人们了解民族工业是如何发展起来的”，硬要通过展览去歌颂罪恶的资本主义剥削制度，去歌颂资产阶级的发家史。三条石工人阶级强烈地抵制了他们篡改历史的反革命罪行。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。革命群众并把这些家伙塞进三条石历史博物馆的反革命修正主义黑货，统统扫进了历史的垃圾堆。
    从今年四月份开始，在天津市革命委员会的领导下，在驻馆解放军的支持和帮助下，博物馆着手进行恢复原来阶级教育展览的工作。参加复展工作的人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义黑货。在复展筹备工作中，广泛地征求了各级革命委员会、解放军及革命师生，特别是三条石老工人的意见，把被反革命修正主义分子周扬及其后台中国赫鲁晓夫颠倒了的历史，重新颠倒过来，使三条石展览馆成为宣传毛泽东思想的阵地、革命大批判的战场、进行阶级教育的课堂。
    这次展出的内容包括三个部分，即：三条石工人阶级的形成，三条石工人阶级的血泪史和三条石工人阶级的斗争史。在三条石工人阶级的形成部分中，以详尽的图表和确凿的见证材料，说明了三条石工人阶级百分之九十五以上来自破产农民。三条石资本家，就是靠剥削压榨这些丧失了生产手段的一无所有的劳动者来过活的。在血泪史部分中，用大量的卖身契、铺规、奴役压榨工人的“催命铃”、“昧心表”、马棒等实物和工人悲惨遭遇的组画，揭露了三条石资本家对工人进行政治迫害和残酷剥削的滔天罪行，有力地批驳了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“剥削有功”的无耻谰言。斗争史部分，热情地歌颂了三条石工人阶级在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在中国共产党的正确领导下，团结起来，展开不屈不挠斗争的革命英雄气概。
    展出后接待的第一批观众是三条石老工人。他们怀着无比激动的心情参观了展览。许多老工人深有感触地说：“看到这个展览，重新回忆起在旧社会受万恶的资本家残酷剥削压榨的苦，更觉今日甜。真是爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千重要万重要捍卫无产阶级专政最重要。”他们一致表示：不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，永远跟着毛主席干革命。
    三条石很多工厂组织工人参观三条石阶级教育展览后进行了座谈讨论。座谈中他们学习了毛主席的最新指示，检查了落实毛主席最新指示的情况，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，更好地发挥工人阶级的领导作用，不断在斗争中提高自己的政治觉悟，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
