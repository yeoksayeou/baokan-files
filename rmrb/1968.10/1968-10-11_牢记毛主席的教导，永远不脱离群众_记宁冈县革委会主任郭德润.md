	Remember Chairman Mao's Teachings, Never Leave the Masses
	– A Record of Ninggang County Revolutionary Committee Chairman Guo Derun

	Chairman Mao leads the Cultural Revolution,
	Everywhere there are new people, new things, new styles.
	The new revolutionary committee cadres' thoughts are red,
	Closely connected with the broad masses of the people.

		– New Song from Under the Jian Mountains

	In the revolutionary cradle of Jian Mountains, Ninggang County, there are many stories about Old Guo closely connecting with the masses and deeply entering the masses. Many poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses praise, saying: "Old Guo's style is solid. He is like the cadres of the former worker-peasant government, with hearts close to ours."

	Old Guo is Guo Derun, currently the Chairman of the Ninggang County Revolutionary Committee, previously the County Committee Secretary of this county.

	"Go to the Masses"

	In June of this year, after the first session of the Jiangxi Province Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Chairman Mao Zedong Thought ended, the County Revolutionary Committee organized four propaganda teams with representatives who attended the conference, led by the Standing Committee members, to go to various communes and production teams to propagate the spirit of the conference. On the day they were to go down, it was raining heavily. The propaganda team members were all staying in the Revolutionary Committee. To go, the rain was too heavy; not to go, the commune had already been notified to hold a meeting that evening. Everyone was discussing when Guo Derun, who had just finished assigning work, without saying a word, rolled up his trousers, put on his backpack, opened his umbrella, and led his team spiritedly to the farthest commune from the county seat, Maoping Commune. This action inspired the other three teams to set out in the rain as well. Everyone said while walking: "Old Guo's style has changed, he is a good example for us to learn from."

	Guo Derun indeed changed. This new change began in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

	Guo Derun comes from a poor peasant family. Twenty years ago, with deep hatred for the landlord tyrants and the reactionary Kuomintang, he joined the revolution, growing from an ordinary soldier to the County Committee Secretary. However, with the change in his position, his thoughts and style also changed. He did not always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, resisting the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. He stayed in the city more, went to the countryside less; sat in the office more, went to the masses less, resulting in gradually distancing himself from the masses. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the broad revolutionary masses and poor and lower-middle peasants "bombarded" him, making him suddenly realize: he had made many mistakes, the mistake was in leaving the masses. He followed Chairman Mao's teachings, "You must put politics in command, go to the masses, stay with the masses, and make the cultural revolution of the proletariat better." He carried Chairman Mao's four volumes of revolutionary classics, put on his backpack, and went to the masses. He visited all ten communes and state-owned reclamation farms in the county. Where there were more opinions about him, he went to that unit to seriously listen to the masses' criticisms, sincerely checked his mistakes with the masses, and actively participated in the proletarian cultural revolution with the masses, quickly gaining the masses' understanding and trust. When the County Revolutionary Committee was established, the masses unanimously elected him as the Chairman of the County Revolutionary Committee. He said excitedly: "I will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never leave the masses!"

	Now, Guo Derun spends most of his time with the masses, and everyone affectionately calls him "Old Guo." In the office, he exercises with everyone, studies and applies Chairman Mao's works together, and discusses work together. Everyone is willing to talk to him about their opinions; when going to the countryside, he eats, lives, studies, and works with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants are happy to talk to him. In the past, he went to the countryside by car, but now he always carries his backpack and climbs mountains and walks paths. His home is in a production team next to the county seat, a few old rooms, surrounded by poor and lower-middle peasants. Some comrades see him running around and advise him to move his home to the office, but he always says: "I am a staff member of the Revolutionary Committee, doing mass work every day. Living with the poor and lower-middle peasants, coming and going, talking and chatting, isn't it better?"

	In the process of closely connecting with the masses, Guo Derun deeply felt that connecting with the masses, victory is certain; leaving the masses, nothing can be accomplished. The Bailu Reclamation Farm was originally divided into two factions, fighting "internal wars" for a long time, Chairman Mao's latest instructions could not be implemented, affecting the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, becoming a famous "difficult unit" in the county. Guo Derun, with his backpack and straw shoes, holding high Chairman Mao's portrait, came to the Bailu Reclamation Farm. He put down his backpack and dove into the masses, conducted in-depth investigations, and vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions. He organized everyone to go to the place where Chairman Mao once held a meeting, set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class, and studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with everyone, recalled bitterness and sweetness, and fought against selfishness and revisionism. Through study, the two factions quickly unified their will under Chairman Mao's command, achieving revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination. The "difficult unit" leaped to become one of the advanced units in the county. Everyone praised, saying Old Guo followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, went deep into the masses to spread Chairman Mao's voice, truly solid!

	Think what the poor and lower-middle peasants think, worry about what the poor and lower-middle peasants worry about

	Once, Guo Derun went to Longshi Commune Xiejia Er Production Team for a work point, just encountering the death of old poor peasant Zhang Haiquan. Guo Derun, with a heavy heart, went to Zhang Haiquan's home with the production team cadres. In front of Zhang Haiquan's body, he said to the cadres: "Zhang Grandpa suffered for half his life in the old society, and only lived a good life after liberation. He actively took the socialist road, followed Chairman Mao wholeheartedly, and was a good poor peasant. He had no children, and we are his children!" He followed Chairman Mao's teachings, "When someone in the village dies, hold a memorial service." He held a memorial service for Zhang Haiquan with the village cadres and community members. At the memorial service, the production team leader recounted the life of old poor peasant Zhang Haiquan, and Guo Derun also compared Zhang Grandpa's life in the old and new societies, recalling bitterness and sweetness, giving everyone a living class education. Then, he buried Zhang Haiquan's body with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw all this and thought about it. An old poor peasant, moved, held Guo Derun's hand and said: "You are truly a good son of the poor and lower-middle peasants! In the old society, the poor were worse off than a cow, and when they died, they were as worthless as an ant. Now, the cadres and we have one heart, even taking care of the funeral of an orphaned old person so meticulously, better than a biological son, truly Chairman Mao leads well!" This old poor peasant excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of Chairman Mao!"

	Guo Derun's deep class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants were established in the struggle with them. He summed up his feelings in a few words: the deeper the feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, the closer the connection with them; the closer the connection with them, the deeper the feelings for them.

	Chairman Mao teaches: "Cadres should participate in collective production labor to maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, Guo Derun insists on participating in collective production labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants, further strengthening his connection with them and deepening his class feelings with them. One day, he came to the Dajiangbian Production Team to work. The community members were very happy. Seeing that he was not in good health and had not participated in labor much in the past, they arranged for him to do light work. He did not agree and insisted on plowing the field. After less than two hours, old poor peasant Wen Zhonghai came over and let him rest, and kindly encouraged him. Guo Derun originally felt a bit sore in his waist and back, but after hearing the old poor peasant's words, he felt strengthened all over, and continued to plow the field. After work, Guo Derun's heart was not calm for a long time: the poor and lower-middle peasants' feelings for him were so deep! But he, in the past, often thought of the poor and lower-middle peasants, but in recent years, his feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants had become shallow, how dangerous! From then on, every time he went to the countryside, no matter how busy the work was or how long the time was, he would set aside some time to participate in collective production labor with the community members, and always insisted on doing heavy and dirty work, working with the community members, and sweating with them. In this way, every time he participated in labor, his class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants deepened.

	Guo Derun also cares about the poor and lower-middle peasants in his life. In June of this year, when he was passing by the entrance of Dazhong Commune on his way to the countryside, he saw that three wooden bridges had been washed away by the flood. The poor and lower-middle peasants going to work, going to the market, or children going to school had to wade through the water or take detours, which was inconvenient and dangerous. Seeing this situation, he immediately discussed with the commune revolutionary committee members and organized manpower to quickly repair the three wooden bridges. The poor and lower-middle peasant community members praised him, saying: "Old Guo truly thinks what we poor and lower-middle peasants think, worries about what we poor and lower-middle peasants worry about, and does everything for us poor and lower-middle peasants with one heart."

	Always be a student of the masses

	Guo Derun deeply felt in the process of connecting with the masses that if he did not have the attitude of being a student of the masses, he would not have the sweetness of connecting with the masses, nor would he have the qualification to be a teacher of the masses. When he summarized his feelings, he said that the more humble he was as a student of the masses, the sweeter the connection with the masses would be, and the better the connection with the masses would be.

	In the "one red pair" activity among the revolutionary committee members, Guo Derun deliberately paired with worker representative Tan Zusheng to be his student. Tan Zusheng is a worker in his fifties who loves the great leader Chairman Mao infinitely, studies Chairman Mao's instructions seriously, understands them deeply, and executes them resolutely. After becoming a member of the County Revolutionary Committee, he still lives and works with the worker masses. Guo Derun learned many precious things from this old worker. In July, the County Revolutionary Committee was holding a study class in Gucheng Commune. One night at ten o'clock, Chairman Mao's latest instructions were broadcast: "Universities should still be run. Here, I mainly talk about the need to run universities for science and engineering. However, the system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command, following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, and after studying for a few years in school, they should return to production practice." After listening to the broadcast, Guo Derun and everyone were excited. He saw that it was already past eleven, so he wanted to let everyone rest and study the next day. But Tan Zusheng immediately said: "Chairman Mao's latest instructions express the feelings of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, and are the greatest concern and encouragement for the people of the whole country. We should act immediately, study immediately, and transmit immediately!" Guo Derun was both happy and ashamed, happy that the old worker educated him, making him deepen his understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions; ashamed that he did not understand Chairman Mao's instructions as deeply as the old worker, nor did he follow them as closely. He tightly held Tan Zusheng's hand and excitedly said: "You are always my good teacher!" He organized everyone to study that night and spread Chairman Mao's great instructions to every corner of the county.

	Guo Derun always took the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants around him as examples, checking and urging himself. During the busy spring plowing season, he was stationed in the Hongxing Production Team of Maoping Commune. Old poor peasant Yuan Maosheng actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," ignoring his own illness, and returned from the hospital in advance to participate in spring plowing and transplanting. The community members advised him to rest, but he said: "This year is the year to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. How can I rest!" All this, Guo Derun saw with his own eyes and remembered in his heart. He often used Chairman Mao's teachings as a weapon and this poor peasant as an example to inspire himself to overcome difficulties and do a good job. Comrades advised him to rest, but he replied: "Compared with the poor and lower-middle peasant community members, I should work even harder!"

	In Guo Derun's work notebook, there are many opinions, suggestions, and requests from revolutionary masses. These are all what he humbly asked from the masses, bit by bit. He said: "With the masses' opinions, suggestions, requests, etc., I work with a solid heart; without these, I feel empty inside." In July, he harvested early rice with the community members in the Hengjie Production Team of Gucheng Commune. Looking at the vast golden rice fields, his heart was as full of joy as the community members'. "This year, it was both drought and flood, why did we still achieve a bumper harvest?" He asked the community members, and they eagerly replied: "It is the victory of Chairman Mao's call to 'grasp revolution and promote production'!" "It is the great victory of the proletarian cultural revolution!" "It is the fruit of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought!" Old poor peasant Zhou Gaofa said: "In the past, the old county committee only cared about the hoe, not the people, and the result was not much harvest. Now, the revolutionary committee leads the study of Chairman Mao's works, sets up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, manages the people's heads, and production has a harvest. I think the bumper harvest is the great victory of emphasizing proletarian politics!" Guo Derun recorded these words in his notebook, took them back to the county, and reported them at the County Revolutionary Committee meeting, making everyone enlightened and educated. The County Revolutionary Committee immediately took effective measures to push the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the whole county to a new height.

    牢记毛主席的教导，永远不脱离群众
    ——记宁冈县革委会主任郭德润
    毛主席领导文化大革命，
    处处有新人新事新作风。
    新生革委会干部思想红，
    紧密联系广大人民群众。
                              ——井冈山下新歌
    革命摇篮井冈山下的宁冈县，流传着许多关于老郭密切联系群众、艰苦深入群众的故事。好多贫下中农和革命群众称赞说：“老郭的作风就是过得硬。他象当年工农兵政府的干部一样，和我们心贴着心。”
    老郭叫郭德润，现在是宁冈县革委会主任，原先是这个县的县委书记。
    “到群众里面去”
    今年六月，江西省第一届活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会刚结束，县革委会就组织四个有出席大会的代表参加的宣传队，由常委带领，分赴各公社、生产队去宣传大会的精神。要下去这天，正下大雨，宣传队的同志都在革委会里呆着。走，雨太大；不走，已经通知公社晚上召开大会。大家正纷纷议论时，刚把工作交代完的郭德润二话没说，卷起裤腿，背上行李，打起雨伞，就带着他那一队人精神抖擞地到离县城最远的茅坪公社去了。这一来，其他三个队也冒雨出发了。大家边走边说：“老郭的作风变样了，是我们学习的好榜样。”
    郭德润的确变了。这个新的变化，是在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中开始的。
    郭德润出身穷苦的贫农家庭。二十年前，他怀着对地主恶霸和国民党反动派的深仇大恨参加了革命，由一个普通战士慢慢成长为县委书记。可是，随着地位的变化，他的思想作风也起了变化。他没有时刻牢记毛主席的教导，抵制住资产阶级思想的侵蚀。他住城里多，下农村少了；坐办公室多，到群众中去少了，结果同群众的距离渐渐远了。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命群众和贫下中农起来“炮轰”他，使他猛然惊醒过来：自己犯了许多错误，错就错在脱离了群众上。他遵照毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，怀揣毛主席的四卷革命宝书，背上背包，到群众中去了。他走遍了全县十个人民公社和国营垦殖场。那个单位对他意见多，他就到那个单位去认真听取群众的批评，诚恳地向群众检查自己的错误，并且和群众一道积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，很快取得了群众的谅解和信任。县革委会成立时，群众又一致推选他担任了县革委会主任。他无限激动地说：“我要永远牢记毛主席的教导，永远不脱离群众！”
    现在，郭德润的绝大部分时间都在群众中，大家都亲切地叫他“老郭”。在机关，他同大家一道出早操，一道活学活用毛主席著作，一道研究工作，大家有什么意见都愿意找他讲；下乡后，他跟贫下中农同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动，贫下中农有什么心里话都乐意跟他说。他过去下乡是小汽车接送，现在一概自己背着背包爬山走道。他的家住在县城旁的一个生产队里，几间旧房子，周围都是贫下中农。有的同志见他跑来跑去，就劝他把家搬到机关里来，他总是说：“我是革委会的工作人员，天天做的是群众工作，跟贫下中农住在一块，来来往往，谈谈讲讲，挺亲热的，不是更好吗？”
    在紧密联系群众的过程中，郭德润深刻地体会到，联系群众，百战百胜；脱离群众，一事无成。柏露垦殖场原来分成两派，长期打“内战”，毛主席最新指示落实不了，影响了革命的大联合和革命三结合，成了全县有名的“老大难”单位。郭德润背着背包，穿着草鞋，高举着毛主席画像来到了柏露垦殖场。他放下背包，就一头扎到群众中，深入调查研究，大力宣传毛主席的最新指示。他组织大家到毛主席当年召开过会议的地方，办起毛泽东思想学习班，同大家一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起忆苦思甜，斗私批修。通过学习，两派群众组织很快在毛主席的号令下统一了意志，实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，“老大难”单位一跃而成为全县先进单位之一。大家都称赞说，老郭紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，艰苦深入群众传播毛主席的声音，真是过得硬！
    想贫下中农所想，急贫下中农所急
    有一次，郭德润到垄市公社谢家二队蹲点，正遇上老贫农张海泉病逝。郭德润怀着沉痛的心情，同生产队干部一起赶到张海泉家。他在张海泉遗体前对干部们说：“张大爷在旧社会受了大半辈子苦，解放后才过上好日子。他积极走社会主义道路，一心跟着毛主席，是个好贫农。他无儿无女，我们就是他的儿女！”他遵照毛主席“村上的人死了，开个追悼会”的教导，同村上的干部、社员一起，为张海泉老人开了一个追悼会。在追悼会上，生产队长追述了老贫农张海泉的生平，郭德润也以张大爷的一生作了新旧社会的对比，忆苦思甜，给大家上了一堂活的阶级教育课。然后，他又同贫下中农一道安葬了张海泉的遗体。贫下中农把这一切都看在眼里，想在心头。一个老贫农感动地拉着郭德润的手说：“你真是贫下中农的好儿子！在旧社会，穷人生不如一条牛，死了贱得象一只蚂蚁。现在，干部和我们一个心，连孤寡老人的后事都办得这么周到，胜过亲生的儿子，真是毛主席领导得好呀！”这位老贫农激动地连连高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    郭德润对贫下中农的深厚阶级感情，是他同贫下中农在一道战斗中建立起来的。他把自己的体会归结为这样几句话：对贫下中农感情越深，和贫下中农联系越紧；和贫下中农联系越紧，对贫下中农感情越深。
    毛主席教导说：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。”遵照毛主席的教导，郭德润坚持同贫下中农一起参加集体生产劳动，进一步密切了同贫下中农的联系，加深了自己同贫下中农的阶级感情。一天，他来到大江边生产队参加劳动，社员们非常高兴。大家看他身体不大好，过去参加劳动又少，便安排他干轻活。他没有同意，争着去犁田。干了不到两个小时，老贫农文忠海又走过来让他歇一歇，并亲切地鼓励了他。郭德润本来觉得有些腰酸背痛，听了老贫农的一番话，浑身增添了力量，又扬起鞭来继续犁田。收工回来，郭德润心中久久不平静：贫下中农对自己的感情是多么深厚！而自己呢，过去还经常想到贫下中农，可近几年来对贫下中农的感情却变得淡薄了，这是多么危险！从此，每次下乡，不管工作多紧，时间多长，他都要抽出一定时间和社员一同参加集体生产劳动，而且总是抢着干重活、脏活，和社员劳动在一起，汗水流在一起。这样，他每参加一次劳动，对贫下中农的阶级感情就增深一分。
    郭德润在生活方面也很关心贫下中农。今年六月，他下乡路过大拢公社门口时，看到三座木桥都给洪水冲垮了，贫下中农出工、赶集，小孩子上学，或是涉水而过，或是绕道而行，既不方便，又很危险。看到这种情况，他马上同公社革委会的同志一道商量出解决办法，组织人力迅速把三座木桥修复了。贫下中农社员称赞他说：“老郭真是想我们贫下中农所想，急我们贫下中农所急，一个心眼为我们贫下中农办事。”
    永远做群众的小学生
    郭德润在联系群众的过程中深深感到，如果没有甘当群众小学生的态度，就没有联系群众的甜头，更没有当群众先生的资格。他总结自己体会的时候说，越是虚心当群众的小学生，联系群众就越有甜头，和群众联系得就越好。
    在革委会成员之间开展“一对红”的活动中，郭德润有意识地和工人代表谭祖生结成对子，当谭祖生的小学生。谭祖生是个五十多岁的工人，对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对毛主席的指示学得认真，领会深刻，执行坚决。他当上县革委会委员后，仍然同工人群众生活和劳动在一起。郭德润从这位老工人身上学到了很多宝贵的东西。七月间，县革委会正在古城公社办学习班。一天晚上十点多钟，传来了毛主席的最新指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”听完广播，郭德润和大家一样欢欣鼓舞。他看已经十一点多了，就想叫大家休息，明天再学习。可谭祖生马上说：“毛主席的这一最新指示，说出了工人阶级、贫下中农的心里话，是对全国人民的最大关怀和最大鼓舞，我们应该闻风而动，马上学习，立刻传达！”郭德润听了又高兴又惭愧，高兴的是老工人教育了自己，使自己加深了对毛主席最新指示的理解；惭愧的是自己对毛主席的指示不如老工人理解得深，不如老工人跟得紧。他紧紧握着谭祖生的手，激动地说：“你永远是我的好老师！”他连夜组织大家学习，把毛主席的伟大指示传播到全县各地。
    郭德润处处都以身边的工人、贫下中农为榜样，对照检查自己、鞭策自己。春耕大忙时，他在茅坪公社红星生产队蹲点。老贫农袁茂生积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，不顾自己身体有病，提前出医院赶回来参加春耕插秧。社员们劝他休息，他说：“今年是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一年，我怎么歇得下！”这一切，郭德润都看在眼里，记在心里。他经常以毛主席的教导为武器，以这位贫农为榜样，来激励自己克服困难，做好工作。同志们劝他注意休息，他回答说：“和贫下中农社员比一比，我更应当加倍努力地工作！”
    在郭德润的工作日记本上，记满了来自革命群众的意见、建议和要求。这些，都是他以小学生的态度，从群众那里一点一滴地征求来的。他说：“有了群众的意见、建议、要求等等，我工作起来就心里踏踏实实；没有这些，我就觉得心里空空荡荡的。”七月间，他在古城公社横街生产队和社员一同收割早稻。他望着大片金黄色的稻子，心里和社员们一样充满了丰收的喜悦。“今年又是旱又是涝，为什么还获得了大丰收？”他向社员一问，社员们争相回答说：“是毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的伟大号召的胜利！”“是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！”“是活学活用毛泽东思想的成果！”老贫农周高发说：“过去，旧县委只抓锄头，不管人头，结果是没有多大收头。现在，革委会领着大学毛主席著作，大办毛泽东思想学习班，管好了人头，生产就有了收头。我看呀，大丰收就是突出无产阶级政治的大胜利！”郭德润把这些话记在本子上，带回县里，在县革委会上做了汇报，使大家都得到启发，受到教育。县革委会立即采取有效措施，把全县活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向了一个新高潮。
