The Brazilian Communist Party's central committee organ, "The Worker's Class Newspaper," recently published an article titled "The Struggle Will Continue," which pointed out that the brutal suppression of the people's movement by the pro-American dictatorship in Brazil will inevitably lead to even stronger resistance. The Brazilian people will ultimately emerge victorious.

The article stated that the reactionary regime in Brazil has been continuously arresting students, brutally attacking universities, ruthlessly suppressing striking workers in São Paulo, and killing farmers in Minas Gerais. This indicates that the dictatorship will adopt an even more brutal policy against the people.

The article further noted that in the face of the surging people's struggle, the reactionaries have decided to use all means to suppress any street demonstrations and marches, deploying armed forces to perform police duties. This is not a sign of the rulers' strength but rather an indication that the reactionaries are cornered by the people's struggle. This makes it clearer to the people that the Brazilian reactionary army is the main pillar of the pro-American dictatorship and a tool of American imperialism in suppressing patriots. It also helps the people realize more quickly that without destroying the reactionary armed forces, true freedom cannot be achieved, and Brazil cannot be freed from foreign shackles.

The article emphasized that no matter how frantic the dictatorship becomes, it will not be able to suppress the people's struggle, extinguish the people's fighting spirit, or stop the tide of the people's movement.

As long as the country is still under the oppression of American imperialism and ruled by a corrupt regime, it will not be able to stop the growing resistance from students, urban and rural workers, intellectuals, and all Brazilians who do not want to live as dollar slaves under the iron hoof of the reactionary military.

The article continued, stating that the vigorous student demonstrations in various states of Brazil, the strike by the workers at the Mossoró salt fields, and the farmers' struggle against landowners in Caçoeira, among others, all indicate that the people's struggle will continue to develop.

The article concluded that the reactionaries' increased suppression of the people will only lead to stronger people's actions. If the dictatorship uses more repression, the people will adopt higher levels of struggle. In this increasingly intense struggle, the people will become stronger and ultimately emerge victorious.

The New China News Agency reported on October 21st from Rio de Janeiro that students in various parts of Brazil have recently held continuous demonstrations and gatherings, strongly protesting the pro-American dictatorship's mass arrests of representatives who recently attended the Brazilian National Student Congress in São Paulo.

According to reports, the pro-American dictatorship arrested approximately one thousand students from various parts of Brazil who were holding a meeting near São Paulo on the 12th. This was another fascist atrocity by the dictatorship in an attempt to suppress the people's struggle as the people's anti-American and anti-military dictatorship struggle intensified, making the reactionaries' days increasingly difficult.

After the news of the mass arrest of student representatives spread, major cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasília, Recife, Salvador, and Fortaleza saw continuous and intense protest activities. University students in Rio de Janeiro declared a general strike to protest the reactionary government's atrocities and, on the 15th, broke through the military and police blockade to take to the streets for a protest march. On the 17th, students, despite the reactionary police's persecution, shouted slogans such as "Down with the dictatorship!" and held another protest march and gathering in the city center. Students in São Paulo also held another demonstration on the 17th. In the state capital of Salvador, Bahia, over five thousand students participated in the protest march, strongly demanding the immediate release of the arrested student representatives. In Brazil's capital, Brasília, several hundred women and students also held a protest march.

    巴西共产党机关报《工人阶级报》指出
    独裁政权对人民的镇压将激起更强烈反抗
    巴西学生集会示威高呼“打倒独裁统治！”的口号，抗议反动当局逮捕学生代表
    新华社二十一日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西共产党中央委员会机关报《工人阶级报》最近在一篇题为《斗争将继续》的评论中指出，巴西亲美独裁当局对人民运动的残暴镇压，必将激起更加强烈的反抗，巴西人民必将取得最后胜利。
    评论指出，巴西反动当局最近以来连续逮捕学生，野蛮地袭击大学，残酷镇压圣保罗罢工的工人，杀害米纳斯吉拉斯的农民，这表明，独裁政权将采取一种对人民实行更加残暴的政策。
    评论指出，面对着人民斗争的高涨，反动派决定使用一切手段制止任何街头示威游行，调动武装部队执行警察的任务，这决不是当权者力量强大的表现，而是表明，现在反动派在人民斗争的压力下，已经走投无路。这就使人民更清楚地认识到，巴西的反动军队是亲美独裁统治的主要支柱，是美帝国主义镇压爱国者的工具。这也可以使人民更迅速地觉悟到，不摧毁反动的武装部队，就不可能取得真正的自由，就不可能使巴西从外国的枷锁下解放出来。
    评论指出：但是，不管独裁政权如何疯狂，它将压制不住人民的斗争，扼杀不了人民群众的斗争意志，也阻挡不住人民运动的高潮。
    当国家还处在美帝国主义者压迫下和被一个腐朽政权所统治时，它将没有力量制止学生、城市和农村的劳动者、正直的知识分子和一切不愿在反动军人铁蹄下作为美元奴隶而生活的巴西人的日益高涨的反抗。
    评论接着说，巴西各州风起云涌、朝气勃勃的学生示威游行，莫索罗盐场工人的罢工，卡绍埃伊拉农民反对土地霸占者的斗争，等等，都表明人民群众的斗争将得到进一步的发展。
    评论最后说：反动派对人民加强镇压，得到的回答将是人民行动的加强。如果独裁统治开动更多的镇压机器，那么人民将采取更高水平的斗争形式。在这个越来越激烈的斗争过程中，人民群众将锻炼得更加坚强，并将取得最后胜利。
    新华社二十一日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西各地的学生最近连续举行示威和集会，强烈抗议巴西亲美独裁政权大肆逮捕不久前到圣保罗参加巴西全国学生代表会议的代表。
    据报道，巴西亲美独裁政权十二日在圣保罗附近一个地方逮捕了约一千名正在举行会议的巴西各地的学生代表。这是在巴西人民反美反军事独裁斗争日益高涨、反动派的日子愈来愈不好过的形势下，独裁当局妄图镇压群众斗争烈火的又一法西斯暴行。
    大批学生代表被捕的消息传出后，里约热内卢、圣保罗、巴西利亚、累西腓、萨尔瓦多、福塔雷萨等重要城市连日来相继爆发了激烈的群众性抗议活动。里约热内卢的大学生宣布总罢课，抗议反动当局的暴行，并在十五日冲破军警的包围和阻挠，涌向街头举行抗议游行示威。十七日，学生们不顾反动警察的迫害，高呼“打倒独裁统治！”等口号，在市中心地区再次举行抗议示威和集会。圣保罗的学生在十七日也再次举行了示威游行。在巴伊亚州首府萨尔瓦多，参加抗议示威的大、中学生达五千多人，他们强烈要求立即释放被捕的学生代表。在巴西的首都巴西利亚，还有好几百名妇女和学生们一起举行了抗议示威。
