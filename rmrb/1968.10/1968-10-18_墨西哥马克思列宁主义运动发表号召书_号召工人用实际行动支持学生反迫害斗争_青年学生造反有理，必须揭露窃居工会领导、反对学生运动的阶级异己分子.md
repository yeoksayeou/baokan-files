	Mexican Marxist-Leninist Movement Issues Call to Action
	Call for Workers to Take Concrete Actions to Support Students Against Repression
	Students' Rebellion is Justified; Expose Class Enemies in Union Leadership Opposing Student Movement

	BEIJING, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- MEXICO CITY -- The Mexican Marxist-Leninist Movement recently issued a call to action, stating that the current struggle of Mexican students against repression and massacre is part of the Mexican people's movement. It called on Mexican workers to take concrete actions to support the students' just struggle.

	The call to action said that Mexican students, facing the repression and massacre by the Mexican authorities, have rebelled. They overcame obstacles, difficulties, and fear of sacrifice to challenge the existing "order." Students were subjected to imprisonment, beatings, and massacres by the police and "riot control squads." When they returned to their schools to regroup, they were brutally suppressed by the military using rifles, machine guns, and rocket launchers. Many were arrested and killed. The call to action said, "The students' rebellion is justified! They are fighting for freedom, democracy, and justice. This movement is completely democratic and a people's movement!"

	The call to action pointed out that the struggle of Mexican students has gained the sympathy and support of people from all walks of life, especially workers and peasants. "The great significance of the student movement lies in the fact that not only students but also other revolutionary classes have raised the banner of struggle, producing and will continue to produce a profound impact on the national democratic revolutionary movement. Its influence has swept across the entire national revolutionary movement. As Chairman Mao taught: 'The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The upsurge of the student movement will inevitably promote the upsurge of the entire people's movement.'"

	The call to action expressed firm support for the students' demands to disband the "riot control squads," abolish laws suppressing people's movements, release political prisoners, release arrested students, and punish the culprits responsible for the killings.

	The call to action said that students have played a vanguard role in the Mexican people's movement, forming the vanguard, but "we must not forget that the student movement alone cannot change society or establish democracy and freedom in our country."

	The call to action emphasized, "Chairman Mao said: 'Who are the revolutionaries? Who is the main force of the revolution? It is the Chinese people. The driving force of the revolution includes the proletariat, the peasantry, and all those in other classes who are willing to fight against imperialism and feudalism. They are all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary forces. But among these people, who is the fundamental force, the backbone of the revolution? It is the 90% of the country's population, the workers and peasants.' Therefore, comrade workers, we should support the student movement with concrete actions."

	The call to action went on to point out that supporting the students' struggle requires exposing and opposing those who have seized the leadership of the unions and oppose the student movement. They are class enemies within the working class.

	The Mexican Marxist-Leninist Movement's call to action concluded: We stand with the revolutionary students. No one can separate us from the revolutionary students. We wholeheartedly support them. We will unreservedly express our support. We can only support the students in struggle through struggle.

    墨西哥马克思列宁主义运动发表号召书
    号召工人用实际行动支持学生反迫害斗争
    青年学生造反有理，必须揭露窃居工会领导、反对学生运动的阶级异己分子
    新华社十七日讯　墨西哥城消息：墨西哥马克思列宁主义运动不久前发表号召书，指出墨西哥学生当前的反迫害、反屠杀斗争，是墨西哥人民运动的一部分，并号召墨西哥工人用实际行动支持学生的正义斗争。
    号召书说，墨西哥学生面对墨西哥当局的镇压和屠杀，起来造反了。他们排除了障碍，克服了困难，不怕牺牲，向现存“秩序”挑战。学生们惨遭警察、“防暴队”的监禁、殴打和屠杀。当他们回到学校重新集结力量的时候，又遭到军队用步枪、机关枪和火箭筒进行的残酷镇压，许多人被逮捕、杀害。号召书说，青年学生造反有理！他们是“为自由而战，为民主和正义而战。这个运动完全是民主的、人民的运动！”
    号召书指出，墨西哥学生的斗争，得到了各阶层人民特别是工人、农民的同情和支持。“学生运动的伟大重要意义就在于，不仅学生高举斗争的旗帜，而且其他革命阶层也高举起斗争旗帜，在全国民主革命运动中产生了并必将继续产生十分深远的影响。它的影响席卷了整个全国革命运动。正如毛主席所教导的那样：‘学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。’”
    号召书表示坚决支持学生提出的解散“防暴队”、废除镇压人民运动的法律、释放政治犯、释放被捕学生、惩办杀人的罪魁祸首等要求。
    号召书说，学生在墨西哥人民运动中起了先锋作用，他们组成了前哨，但是，“一定不要忘记，单靠学生运动不能变革社会，不能建立我国的民主和自由。”
    号召书强调指出，“毛主席说：‘革命是什么人去干呢？革命的主体是什么呢？就是中国的老百姓。革命的动力，有无产阶级，有农民阶级，还有其他阶级中一切愿意反帝反封建的人，他们都是反帝反封建的革命力量。但是这许多人中间，什么人是根本的力量，是革命的骨干呢？就是占全国人口百分之九十的工人农民。’所以，工人同志们，我们应该用实际行动支持学生运动。”
    号召书接着指出，支持学生的斗争，必须揭露和反对那些窃居工会领导的反对学生运动的家伙，他们是工人阶级的异己分子。
    墨西哥马克思列宁主义运动的号召书最后表示：我们站在革命学生一边，谁也不能把我们和革命学生分开，我们衷心地支持他们。我们要毫无保留地表示支持，我们只有通过斗争才能支持斗争中的学生。
