The revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao County, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have been vigorously promoting production while carrying out the revolution with unyielding heroism. They have overcome the challenges posed by saline-alkali soil and, by diverting water from the Yellow River to create rice paddies, have achieved a bumper harvest of rice over large areas. Among these, San Yizhai People's Commune on the banks of the Yellow River is a particularly outstanding example.

1

San Yizhai People's Commune, which had never grown rice before, planted over 11,000 mu this year. Most of the fields yielded over 400-500 jin per mu, with the highest yield reaching over 1,000 jin per mu. The total autumn grain production of the entire commune reached an unprecedented high. For many years, this old disaster-stricken area had relied on state-subsidized grain and relief funds. This year, with just one harvest, the commune turned things around and sold over one million jin of surplus grain to the state in the autumn.

Facing the vast expanse of golden rice fields, the commune members were overjoyed and excited. Many people, upon seeing the golden rice, couldn't help but jump and sing. Many were so happy that they couldn't sleep at night and went to the fields to touch the rice ears and smell the rice fragrance. In the seventh production brigade of Kangzhuang Brigade, there is an 81-year-old poor peasant named Cai Wenhai. For over a year, he had been bedridden. This year, upon hearing the news of the bumper rice harvest, he was so moved that he got out of bed, leaned on a cane, and slowly made his way to the rice fields. After resting more than ten times over a distance of more than a li, he arrived at the rice fields. There, he touched the rice ears with both hands, tears streaming down his face as he said, "I've been a hired laborer all my life, eating grass seeds and drinking bitter water. Now, under Chairman Mao's leadership, rice is growing in the saline-alkali soil! Good! Good! This is all thanks to Chairman Mao. From now on, I will listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao's path."

Who could have imagined that these rice fields were once barren saline-alkali lands! In the past, San Yizhai People's Commune was one of the poorest places in Lankao County. Before liberation, a folk song circulated here:

In spring, everything is white,
In summer, everything is watery,
In autumn, there is nothing to harvest,
In winter, people flee from famine.

After liberation, San Yizhai underwent significant changes. However, natural disasters had not been completely eradicated, and every year, the commune had to rely on state-subsidized grain. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of San Yizhai People's Commune have channelled the boundless enthusiasm generated by the Cultural Revolution into production. They fought against natural disasters, dug canals, and diverted the fertile waters of the Yellow River into the fields. They then allowed the river silt to settle, creating a layer of silt about a chi deep, burying the saline-alkali soil beneath it. The vast expanse of white saline-alkali land was thus transformed into fertile fields.

In the process of achieving a bumper rice harvest over large areas, San Yizhai People's Commune underwent a serious class struggle.

In 1966, when the masses of San Yizhai People's Commune began to divert water from the Yellow River for irrigation and trial rice cultivation, the agent of Khrushchev in China in Lankao County viciously denounced the revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants as "utopian adventurism," claiming that "diverting water from the Yellow River would make the land even more saline, and people would become even poorer." They used every means to suppress the enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants for changing the face of the land, attempting to lead the masses astray and achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of San Yizhai People's Commune, tempered and tested by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on agricultural production. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they launched a mass criticism campaign and conducted mass recollections and comparisons. Many old poor peasants, who had suffered greatly under the old society, recalled the facts of begging for food, selling children, and having no home to return to, leading a miserable life. They fiercely denounced the various fallacies of Khrushchev in China and his heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism. The more they criticized, the more they hated Khrushchev in China; the more they criticized, the more they loved Chairman Mao; the more they criticized, the more determined they were to follow the socialist path. They said, "Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We must achieve something!"

The process of changing to rice cultivation was also a struggle against old habits. As soon as the Yellow River diversion project began, various opinions emerged. Some said, "Growing rice on saline-alkali land? Not only will you not be able to eat the rice, but you won't even be able to harvest the straw. Drinking rice seedling soup is all you can hope for." Some older people's thinking was even more backward. To address this situation, the revolutionary committee of the commune organized revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to repeatedly study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on "changing poverty into revolutionary spirit" and "fighting to change the face of the land." They deeply carried out the struggle against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism, solving various ideological and practical problems in the process of changing to rice cultivation. Through the mass campaign of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants reached an unprecedented height, and their ideological appearance underwent significant changes. They said, "Chairman Mao has shown us the path to happiness. If we don't do it now, when will we do it?"

With their minds made up and determination in place, their enthusiasm soared. To seize the leadership of the rice cultivation change, they quickly selected revolutionary cadres from the commune, representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and water conservancy technicians to form a rice cultivation command department. They vowed to stay in the fields, eat in the fields, and work in the fields. They said, "We will return home when the rice is stored in the granary."

The canal-digging project began in full swing. Every day, teams of commune members, carrying Chairman Mao's portrait, holding Chairman Mao's quotation cards, waving red flags, and singing battle songs, marched to the fields. Brigade competed with brigade, and person competed with person in the emulation activities of learning from each other, catching up, helping, and surpassing. During rest periods, everyone gathered together to study Chairman Mao's works, carry out revolutionary criticism, and struggle against selfishness and revisionism. The entire construction site became a grand classroom of Mao Zedong Thought. Nanzhuang Brigade, originally a notorious poor place, had been a key point of care since liberation. Now, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they were full of spirit and fighting spirit. In the severe winter, when the temperature dropped to minus ten degrees and the ground froze more than a chi deep, the commune decided to temporarily stop digging canals to care for the commune members' health. However, the commune members of Nanzhuang Brigade, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of "firmly resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," continued to wave red flags and work hard against the cold wind every day.

Through the mass campaign of studying Mao Zedong Thought, people's enthusiasm was fully mobilized. One evening, after the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Zhu Village production brigade of the Hequ Brigade ended, several young women voluntarily went to work in the fields. The brigade cadres shouted, "Don't work anymore! Come back and rest!" The cadres' words not only did not bring them back, but the commune members at home, upon hearing this, also picked up their tools and followed them.

Practice is the best teacher. This year's bumper rice harvest made even those who had originally doubted that saline-alkali land could be transformed and were prepared to abandon agriculture and engage in commerce believe. Some brigade cadres and commune members of the San Yizhai Brigade, who had not worked hard in the past, are now actively leading the commune members to dig canals and divert water from the Yellow River for irrigation. An old man, who had not believed in the rice harvest in the past, saw the rice really harvested this time and called the old people of the production brigade to the field, saying:

"Our minds are too old, and we can't use old eyes to look at new things! This year's rice harvest is all thanks to listening to Chairman Mao's words and relying on Chairman Mao's blessings!" The old people all smiled and said, "Right! Right! Without relying on heaven or earth, the harvest is all thanks to Chairman Mao!"

Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the ideological level of the people of San Yizhai People's Commune has been raised, and their revolutionary spirit has been broadened. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "We must not forget Chairman Mao in times of harvest. If it were not for Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, who could have diverted the Yellow River water to irrigate the saline-alkali land? How could there be today's bumper harvest?" The poor and lower-middle peasant commune members of the fifth production brigade of Nanzhuang Brigade, when harvesting rice, selected the best and most full rice ears, one by one, and picked out the grains one by one, ground them into rice, packed them in wooden boxes, wrote "Long Live Chairman Mao," and sent them to the beloved Chairman Mao, asking Chairman Mao to personally taste the rice they harvested from the saline-alkali soil. This is the loyalty of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanzhuang to the great leader Chairman Mao, and it is also the loyalty of the 380,000 people of Lankao County to the great leader Chairman Mao.

    兰考盐碱地稻菽千重浪
    ——三义寨公社盐碱地水稻大面积丰收记实
    兰考县广大革命干部和贫下中农在毛主席革命路线的光辉指引下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，以大无畏的英雄气概，战胜了盐碱，引黄河的水改种稻田，在不少地区水稻获得了大面积丰收。其中黄河岸边的三义寨公社就是最突出的一例。
    一
    从来没有种过水稻的三义寨公社，今年一下子种了一万一千多亩，大部分亩产都在四、五百斤以上，最高亩产达到一千多斤。整个公社的秋粮总产量，达到了空前未有的最高水平。多少年来吃统销粮，花救济款的老灾区，今年一季翻了身，秋季就卖给国家一百万斤余粮。
    面对一片丰收景象，社员们个个喜笑颜开，心情激动。许多人一看见大片金黄色的稻谷，就禁不住跳起来，唱起来。许多人喜得夜里睡不着觉，跑到田里摸稻穗，闻稻香。康寨大队第七生产队有一位八十一岁的贫农老大爷蔡文海，一年多来一直躺在病床上。今年他听说稻子大丰收，激动地下了床，拄着拐棍，一步一步地走向稻田。一里多路，休息了十多次。来到稻田里，他双手捋着稻穗，激动地流着泪水说：“我扛一辈子长工，吃一辈子草籽，喝一辈子苦水，现在，毛主席领导咱，盐碱窝里长出了稻子，好！好！这都是托毛主席他老人家的福，今后俺要好好听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走。”
    面对这片丰收景象，谁能想到这些种稻子的地方，原来是白茫茫的盐碱地！过去，三义寨公社是兰考县最穷的地方之一。解放前，这里流传着一首民歌：
    春天白茫茫，
    夏天水汪汪，
    秋天不见收，
    冬天去逃荒。
    解放后，三义寨有了很大改变。但自然灾害还没有彻底根除，每年都要吃国家统销粮。无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，三义寨公社广大贫下中农和革命干部，把在文化大革命运动中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到生产上。他们战天斗地，挖河修渠，把肥沃的黄河水引进地里，然后让河泥沉淀，积下一层一尺来深的淤泥，把盐碱地深深地压在底下。一片白茫茫的盐碱地被改造成为肥沃的良田。
    二
    三义寨公社在夺取大面积水稻丰收的过程中，经历了一场严重的阶级斗争。
    一九六六年，当三义寨公社广大社员开始引黄灌溉，试种水稻时，中国赫鲁晓夫在兰考的代理人，大骂贫下中农改天换地的革命精神是“空想盲干”，胡说“引黄灌溉会使土地更加碱化，人会更穷。”他们千方百计地打击贫下中农改天换地的积极性，妄图把群众引向邪路，达到他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼和考验的三义寨公社广大贫下中农和革命干部，大学毛主席有关农业生产的光辉指示，以毛泽东思想为武器，开展了群众性的革命大批判，大搞群众性的回忆对比。许多深受旧社会痛苦的老贫农，满怀阶级仇恨，以解放前缺粮求乞、卖儿卖女、无家可归、过着悲惨生活的事实，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的种种谬论和他妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。越批，对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨；越批，对毛主席越亲；越批，走社会主义道路的决心越坚定。他们说：“毛主席给我们撑腰，我们要给毛主席争气，一定要干出个样子来。”
    改种水稻的过程，也是同旧习惯势力作斗争的过程。引黄工程一开始，来自各方面的舆论都出来了。有人说：“盐碱地上种稻子呀！别说吃稻子，连稻草也捞不住，喝稻秧汤差不多。”一些老年人思想更是不通。针对这种情况，公社革命委员会组织广大革命干部和贫下中农反复学习“老三篇”和毛主席“穷则思变，要干，要革命”的教导，学习焦裕禄同志决心改变兰考面貌的决心，深入开展斗私批修活动，解决各种思想认识问题和稻改当中的一系列实际问题。通过群众性的活学活用毛泽东思想运动，广大贫下中农的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，思想面貌发生了很大变化。他们说：“毛主席给咱指出光明幸福的道路，现在不干，啥时干！”
    思想通了，决心下了，干劲也来了。为了取得指挥稻改的领导权，他们很快抽出公社革命干部、贫下中农代表和水利技术员，组成了一个稻改指挥部，在田间吃住，在田间办公。大家发誓说：稻子什么时候归仓，我们什么时候回家。
    开河修渠的工程全面动工了。每天，一队队的社员，抬着毛主席像，举着毛主席语录牌，高举红旗，高唱战歌，开赴田间，队与队，人与人，展开了你追我赶的比、学、赶、帮、超活动。休息时，大家围坐在一起，学习毛主席著作，开展革命的大批判和斗私批修活动，整个工地变成了毛泽东思想的大课堂。南马庄大队，原来是一个穷得出名的地方。解放后，是历年来的照顾重点。如今，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，他们意气风发，斗志昂扬。严冬，气温下降到零下十度，地冻一尺多厚。公社为了照顾社员身体健康，决定暂停挖河。但南马庄的社员发扬“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的革命精神，每天照样高举红旗，迎着寒风，继续苦干。
    通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，人的积极因素充分调动起来了。一天晚上，河渠大队朱庄生产队的毛泽东思想学习班结束后，几个青年妇女自动到地里劳动，队干部喊：“别干啦！回来休息吧！”队干部的话，不但没有把她们喊回来，在家的社员听到了，也扛着工具跟着去了。
    实践最能教育人。今年水稻大丰收，使个别原来不相信盐碱地能够改造，准备弃农经商的干部和社员也都信服了。三义寨大队个别生产队干部，过去工作不努力，现在也积极带领社员开河挖渠，引黄灌溉。有个老年人，过去不相信水稻会丰收，这次，他看到水稻真的丰收了，就把生产队的老年人叫到地头说：
  “咱们的脑筋太老了，可不能用老眼光看新事物啦！今年水稻丰收，这都是听了毛主席的话，托了毛主席的福！”老人们都笑着说：“对！对！不靠天，不靠地，丰收全靠毛主席！”
    三
    经过无产阶级文化大革命，三义寨公社人民的思想境界更高了，革命胸怀更宽广了。贫下中农说：“丰收可不能忘了毛主席，要不是毛主席的英明领导，谁能引黄水灌碱地？那能有今天的大丰收？”南马庄大队第五生产队的贫下中农社员，收割水稻时把长得最好、籽粒最饱的稻子，一穗一穗地选打下来，又一粒一粒地拣出来，碾成大米，装在木箱里，写上“毛主席万岁”，寄给敬爱的毛主席，请毛主席他老人家亲口尝一尝他们在盐碱窝里收获的大米。这是南马庄贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席的一片忠心，也是兰考县三十八万人民对伟大领袖毛主席的一片忠心。
