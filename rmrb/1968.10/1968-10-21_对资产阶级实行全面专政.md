A political party is a tool of class struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." Chairman Mao also teaches us: "The socialist system in our country has been basically established. We have basically achieved victory in the transformation of the ownership of the means of production. However, in the political and ideological fronts, we have not yet fully achieved victory. The question of who will win in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere has not yet been truly resolved. We must continue to struggle against the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie ideologies for a long time."

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a major historical task of the proletarian party is to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in launching a fierce offensive against the bourgeoisie on the ideological front, to fight and win, and to replace them. In the realm of ideology and culture, we must establish the hegemony of the proletariat and implement full dictatorship over the bourgeoisie.

In the socialist period, the construction, rectification, and development of the party are inseparable from the proletarian dictatorship, including the proletarian dictatorship in the ideological sphere. To implement full dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie will not be willing to accept it. They will inevitably use their advantages in ideology and culture to resist. This is a life-and-death struggle. The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," strenuously denies the sharp and complex class struggle in the ideological sphere, and opposes the implementation of proletarian dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the ideological and cultural realm. This, in essence, negates the historical mission of the proletarian party and completely betrays the proletarian dictatorship.

Under the cover of the "extinction of class struggle" theory, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as Lu Dingyi and Zhou Yang, use the academic, educational, news, literary, and publishing fronts they control to peddle feudal, capitalist, and revisionist poison. They aim to corrupt the proletariat and revolutionary masses, hoping to make us unknowingly undergo a "peaceful evolution." They attempt to use soft methods to change the color of our proletarian party and state.

A few years ago, a local capitalist-roader led a "visiting troupe" to our island to perform poisonous plays. We analyzed this using Mao Zedong Thought and recognized it as a very sharp class struggle. Our party branch organized a performance group to counter them. They performed "Two Old Men Watching the Contest," so we performed "Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the Island"; they performed "Liu Sanjie," so we performed "Sweeping Away All Monsters and Demons," engaging in a head-to-head struggle. We used the mighty Mao Zedong Thought to defeat those "emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties," making them flee in disarray. We won a great victory on the ideological front.

The Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of the "extinction of class struggle" theory is, to a significant extent, a rejection of our party leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in launching a fierce offensive against the bourgeoisie on the ideological and cultural fronts, and a rejection of our dictatorship over the bourgeoisie. In essence, it is a rejection of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and paving the way for a full restoration of capitalism. This is a pipe dream! We proletarian revolutionaries and Communist Party members must uphold the revolutionary nature of our party and implement full dictatorship over the bourgeoisie!

    对资产阶级实行全面专政
    “红色前哨雷达站”指导员  马荣贵
    政党是阶级斗争的工具。毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”毛主席还教导我们：“社会主义制度在我国已经基本建立。我们已经在生产资料所有制的改造方面，取得了基本胜利，但是在政治战线和思想战线方面，我们还没有完全取得胜利。无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有真正解决。我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。”无产阶级政党在无产阶级专政条件下，一个重大的历史任务，就是要率领无产阶级和革命群众在思想战线上对资产阶级展开猛烈的进攻，战而胜之，取而代之。在思想文化领域建立起无产阶级的统治地位，对资产阶级实行全面专政。
    在社会主义时期党的建设、整顿和发展，是和无产阶级专政，包括在意识形态领域里的无产阶级专政分不开的。要实行对资产阶级的全面专政，资产阶级是不会甘心的。他们必然要利用他们在思想上、文化上的优势进行顽抗。这是一场你死我活的大搏斗。中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，极力否定意识形态领域内尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，反对在思想文化领域中对资产阶级实现无产阶级专政。这在实际上，就否定了无产阶级政党的历史任务，彻底背叛了无产阶级专政。
    在“阶级斗争熄灭论”的烟幕弹掩护下，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人陆定一、周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，利用他们所盘踞的学术、教育、新闻、文艺、出版等阵地，贩卖封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的黑货，来腐蚀无产阶级和革命群众，妄想以此使我们不知不觉地“和平演变”。他们妄图用“软”的一手来使我们的无产阶级政党和国家改变颜色。
    前几年，地方有一个走资派带领了“慰问团”到我们岛上大演毒草戏。我们用毛泽东思想去分析，认识到这是一场十分尖锐的阶级斗争。我们党支部就组织演唱组和他们唱对台戏。他们演《两个老汉看比武》，我们就演《毛泽东思想照海岛》；他们演《刘三姐》，我们就演《横扫一切牛鬼蛇神》，展开针锋相对的斗争。我们用威力无比的毛泽东思想，把那些“帝王将相”、“才子佳人”打得丢盔弃甲、狼狈不堪。我们在思想战线上打了一个大胜仗。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，很重要的一个方面就是反对我们党领导无产阶级和革命群众在思想文化战线上对资产阶级发动猛烈的进攻，反对我们对资产阶级实行专政。实际上也就是反对在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命，为资本主义的全面复辟开辟道路。这是白日做梦！我们无产阶级革命战士、共产党员就是要维护我们党的无产阶级革命性，对资产阶级实行全面专政！
