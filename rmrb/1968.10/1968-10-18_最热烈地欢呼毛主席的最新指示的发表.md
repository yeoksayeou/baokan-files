In the midst of the triumphant songs of victory in seizing the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the critical moment when our working class ascends to the stage of the superstructure to lead the broad masses in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the important editorial of the "Red Flag" magazine conveyed our great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive: "A person has arteries and veins, and through the heart, blood circulates. He also needs to breathe through the lungs, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is called expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. If it does not eliminate waste and absorb fresh blood, the party will lose its vitality." I and my family gathered around the radio to carefully listen to Chairman Mao's latest directive. After listening, I was full of energy, my blood boiling.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the most outstanding leader of the working class. You and the working class are always heart to heart. Your brilliant latest directive speaks the words in our hearts. I want to shout with all my heart: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

Dear Chairman Mao! Your brilliant directive is the fundamental direction for the construction of our party. Your brilliant directive points out the fundamental path for building a fighting, vigorous proletarian vanguard organization. Your latest directive on "expelling the old and taking in the new" is an eternal truth and a powerful ideological weapon for us to do a good job in party rectification and construction.

The party's favor is greater than heaven and earth, and parents' love is not as deep as Chairman Mao's. I am already 44 years old. Throughout my life, I have learned many things, but the most important thing I have learned is this truth: the party and Chairman Mao are my saviors. Under the nurturing of the party, I have raised my class consciousness. To dedicate my life to the magnificent cause of communism, I have applied to join the vanguard organization of the working class—the Communist Party of China—with great enthusiasm five times.

However, who would have thought that my request, my strong wish, was suppressed by the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in our factory. The agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in our factory adopted a vicious attitude of "no reply, no cultivation, no development" or "little reply, little cultivation, little development" towards the issue of workers from working-class and poor peasant backgrounds joining the party, keeping us out of the door all the time.

Not only that, but the capitalist roaders within the party actively sought out and cultivated those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed, pulling them into the party. In our factory, there was a bad element who had joined the party in another unit but had not been able to become a formal member for five or six years. Under the protection of the capitalist roaders within the party, he was not only pulled into the party but also promoted to become the secretary of the workshop party branch and the director of the factory party committee's propaganda department.

We have long hated the treacherous and despicable activities of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our factory. At that time, I looked towards Zhongnanhai with my eyes, thinking of Chairman Mao in my heart, and hoping that the day would come soon when we could smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and drive out the counter-revolutionary revisionists who had infiltrated the party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev!

A thunderous spring thunder roared, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, began. At this time, I, together with party members who stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the revolutionary masses of the entire factory, rebelled against the Chinese Khrushchev, rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within our factory, and rebelled against the revisionist party-building line. We seized their power. Politically, we stood up again. When the factory revolutionary committee was established, everyone let me become a member of the factory revolutionary committee. During the 19th anniversary of National Day, I, together with the representatives of the working class from all over the country, happily lived in Zhongnanhai near Chairman Mao, and received Chairman Mao's warm care and reception. Today, Chairman Mao has issued a new directive on party rectification and construction, opening the door for the advanced elements of the working class to join their vanguard organization. All of this is given to us by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao cares for us, the working class, in this way. We are indescribably moved and happy.

We, the working class, must closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, taking Chairman Mao's latest directive as our guide. Together with the broad masses of party members, we must resolutely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist party-building line, eliminate its poison; firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Let us strive to build our party into an even stronger, purer, more united, and more vigorous proletarian vanguard organization!

    最热烈地欢呼毛主席的最新指示的发表
    北京市焦化厂革委会委员、机修车间老工人　王贵英
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的阵阵凯歌声中，在我们工人阶级登上上层建筑斗批改的舞台、领导广大群众进行斗批改的关键时刻，《红旗》杂志的重要社论传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”我和我一家老小围在收音机旁细心聆听毛主席的最新指示。听完后，我浑身是劲，热血沸腾。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家是我们工人阶级最杰出的领袖，您和我们工人阶级总是心连着心，您的光辉的最新指示说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。我要纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    敬爱的毛主席啊！您的光辉指示是我们党建设的根本方向，您的光辉指示为我们指出了建设一个战斗的、朝气蓬勃的无产阶级先锋队组织的根本途径。您关于“吐故纳新”的最新指示，是永恒的真理，是我们搞好整党建党工作的强大思想武器。
    天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。我今年已经四十四岁了。长这么大以来，学这学那，最重要的是我学到了一条真理，这就是：党和毛主席是我的救命恩人，在党的哺育下，使我提高了阶级觉悟。为了把我的一生献给壮丽的共产主义事业，我曾经怀着满腔热情，先后五次申请加入工人阶级自己的先锋队组织——中国共产党。
    可是，万万没有想到，我的要求，我的强烈的愿望，竟遭到中国赫鲁晓夫在我厂的代理人的扼杀。中国赫鲁晓夫在我厂的代理人对于出身于工人阶级和贫下中农家庭的工人的入党问题，采取了“不答复，不培养，不发展”或“少答复，少培养，少发展”的恶劣态度，一直把我们关在门外。
    这还不算，党内走资派对于没有改造好的地富反坏右分子却是找上门去，主动“培养”，积极拉入党内。我厂有一个在外单位入党后五、六年没有能转正的坏分子，在党内走资派包庇下，不但被拉入党内，而且还加官晋级，破格提拔为车间支部书记和厂党委宣传部长。
    对于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在焦化厂的代理人这一套招降纳叛、结党营私的反革命勾当，我们早就恨透了。那时候，我两眼望着中南海，心里想念毛主席，巴望着早一天把反革命修正主义路线砸烂，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的混进党内的反革命修正主义分子清除出去！
    春雷一声震天响，伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这一场伟大的文化大革命开始了。这时候，我和站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边的党员以及全厂的无产阶级革命派一起，造了中国赫鲁晓夫的反，造了我厂党内一小撮走资派的反，造了修正主义建党路线的反，并且夺了他们的权。在政治上我们又翻身了。在成立厂革委会时，大伙让我当了厂革委会委员，在国庆十九周年的时候，我和全国工人阶级代表一起，幸福地住到中南海毛主席他老人家身边，受到毛主席他老人家的亲切关怀和接见。今天，毛主席又发出了关于整党建党的最新指示，为我们工人阶级的先进分子参加自己的先锋队组织敞开了大门。这一切的一切，都是毛主席他老人家给的。毛主席他老人家这样地关怀我们工人阶级，我们有说不出的激动，有说不出的幸福。
    我们工人阶级一定要紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，以毛主席的最新指示为指针，与广大的党员一起，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义建党路线，肃清它的流毒；坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为把我党建设成一个更加坚强，更加纯洁，更加团结，更加朝气蓬勃的无产阶级先锋队组织而奋斗！
