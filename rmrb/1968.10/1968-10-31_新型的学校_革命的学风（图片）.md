Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the countryside, schools should be run by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Chairman Mao's brilliant directive illuminates the path for the rural education revolution, expressing the heartfelt wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The establishment of the Chengzhuang Agricultural Labor School in Xinchai County, Henan Province, vividly demonstrates that having the poor and lower-middle peasants run schools is excellent! This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian education line!

In Chengzhuang Agricultural Labor School—a new type of school run by the poor and lower-middle peasants—Chairman Mao's works are the most precious textbooks, the vast countryside is the ideal classroom, crops are the most vivid teaching materials, and the poor and lower-middle peasants, who possess a thorough revolutionary spirit and practical production experience, are the best teachers.

The poor and lower-middle peasants are the closest to Chairman Mao and have the deepest understanding of his proletarian education line. During the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes and two lines, old poor peasant Long Qinghai bravely stood up to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian education line. Now, he is working with his fellow students to thoroughly criticize the revisionist education line of China's Khrushchev, determined to sail forward to victory along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

The students trained by this school do not aim to "study for officialdom" but to work for the revolution in agriculture. The first batch of graduates, Shen Xiuying, has settled in the countryside and is fighting against nature alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, transforming the natural environment. She is a highly praised technical expert by the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a picture of her observing the production situation of "sweet potato laying eggs" with old poor peasant Sun Guangfu.

Henan Province's agricultural labor model, Chengzhuang Brigade Revolutionary Committee Director, and member of the Chengzhuang Agricultural Labor School leadership group Mao Haozhu, is discussing with students how to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives on educational revolution, determined to thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating schools and to carry the rural educational revolution through to the end.

    新型的学校  革命的学风
    ——河南省新蔡县程庄农业劳动学校学生的活动片断
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席的光辉指示，照亮了农村教育革命的道路，说出了贫下中农的心里话。河南省新蔡县程庄农业劳动学校的创办，生动地说明了贫下中农管理学校好得很！这是毛主席无产阶级教育路线的伟大胜利！
    在程庄农业劳动学校——这所由贫下中农管理的新型学校里，毛主席著作是最宝贵的课本，广阔天地是最理想的课堂，农作物是最生动的教材，具有彻底革命精神又有生产实践经验的贫下中农是最好的老师。
    贫下中农对毛主席最亲，对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线理解最深。老贫农龙青海在两个阶级、两条路线大搏斗的关键时刻，勇敢地站出来保卫了毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。现在他又和同学们一起彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，决心沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。
    这个学校培养的学生，不是为了“升学做官”，而是为革命种田。第一届毕业生申秀英已落户在农村，和贫下中农一起战天斗地，改造自然，是贫下中农称赞的好技术员。这是她在同老贫农孙广夫观察“红薯下蛋”的生产情况。
    河南省农业劳动模范、程庄大队革委会主任、程庄农业劳动学校领导小组成员毛好珠，和同学们一起讨论落实毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，决心彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，把农村教育革命进行到底。
