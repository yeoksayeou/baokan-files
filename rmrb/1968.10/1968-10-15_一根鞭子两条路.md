The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shuiyuan Brigade, Shuiyuan People's Commune, Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, are following Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasping revolution and promoting production" and have launched a vigorous production campaign.

However, the carter Liu Yongmao of the Second Production Team was sulking at home. His wife, Cheng Lihua, was puzzled: "Usually, he gets up early and rushes to the production team. He sits by the trough watching the livestock eat until they are full before he goes home for a meal. He doesn't come home until late at night without lighting a lamp, but today, why did he suddenly stop driving the cart?"

After dinner, Cheng Lihua convened a family meeting to criticize and repudiate revisionism. At the meeting, after studying Chairman Mao's great teachings on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and "grasping revolution and promoting production," Cheng Lihua said, "Your father wanted to stop driving the cart because of a dispute over work points. Everyone, how should we understand this issue?" Before she finished speaking, the little daughter eagerly said, "Everything we do is for the people. Doing revolution cannot be about bargaining. Father wanted to stop driving the cart because of fewer work points; this is selfishness, it's being poisoned by China's Khrushchev's 'work points in command'..."

Liu Yongmao got angry and said, "Without 'points,' how can we live?" Cheng Lihua couldn't hold back any longer. She said, "Without Chairman Mao leading us to establish the people's commune, without socialism, where would we get our 'points' from? If we only care about work points and forget about the revolution, wouldn't we be going back to the old ways?" When she mentioned going back to the old ways, Liu Yongmao thought about the past: Before liberation, he drove a cart for the landlord, working like a beast of burden day and night, still unable to feed his family. It was Chairman Mao who saved the poor from the pit of fire, leading them onto the bright path of socialism. Now, he had forgotten his roots and wanted to stop driving the cart over a few work points. What else could this be but forgetting one's roots? Thinking of this, Liu Yongmao couldn't stop his tears from flowing. He said excitedly, "China's Khrushchev, this bastard, confused me. He is like a worm in the cabbage field, always biting at the roots, rotting our hearts. He wants to use work points to drag us down, to make us slide down the capitalist old road along the 'private line.' This won't do!"

The night deepened, and the meeting to criticize and repudiate revisionism ended with the song "Father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer."

Not long after, Liu Yongmao drove the cart to Haicheng. He loaded the cart, intending to go to the street to handle some private matters and rest for a night before returning. However, he thought of Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production" and thought of the production team being busy with farm work. He felt that his thoughts were wrong. He thought: No matter how big personal matters are, they are small matters. No matter how small public matters are, they are big matters. The struggle between public and private cannot stop for a moment. If there is private interest, it must be fought. Not fighting is disloyal to Chairman Mao. So, he ignored his fatigue and hurried back on a starry night. The usual three-and-a-half-day journey was completed in one and a half days. After the community members heard about this, they all suggested giving him three and a half days' worth of work points. However, Liu Yongmao refused to accept them, saying, "These work points cannot be taken. If more work points are given to me, it would be adding to my selfishness." Later, at the sharing meeting, he spoke from his heart: "The cart is driven by people, and people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With the same whip driving the cart, two paths are taken. Now, with Mao Zedong Thought in my mind, using this whip to drive the cart, I am walking on the bright path of socialism guided by Chairman Mao."

    一根鞭子两条路
    辽宁营口县水源公社水源大队的贫下中农，遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，掀起了热火朝天的生产高潮。
    可是，第二生产队的车把式刘永茂，却闷闷不乐地在家里打转转。他老伴程丽华心里纳闷：“往常他清早起来就往生产队里跑，坐在槽边瞅着牲口吃饱了才回家吃饭，晚上不点灯不回家，今天为啥冷不丁就不出车了呢？”程大娘吃过饭就直奔生产队，从生产队长那里才知道：原来他是为争工分才撂鞭子不干了。
    吃了晚饭，程大娘主持全家开了个斗私批修会。会上，学习了毛主席“要斗私，批修”和“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导后，程大娘说：“你爸爸为了争工分，想撂鞭子不赶车了，大伙看看，这个问题该怎样认识？”话音刚落，小女儿抢着说：“我们所做的一切都是为人民服务，干革命不能讲价钱。爸爸因为工分少，就不赶车，是私字作怪，是中了中国赫鲁晓夫‘工分挂帅’的毒……”刘大爷一听就火了，气鼓鼓地说：“没有‘分’我们靠什么活？”程丽华忍不住了，她说：“没有毛主席领导咱们办起了人民公社，没有社会主义，咱哪来的‘分’？要是光为了工分，忘了革命，不又走上回头路了吗？”提起回头路，刘永茂想起了过去：解放前，自己给地主赶大车，终年在外披星戴月地干着牛马活，还养不活全家。是毛主席把穷人从火坑里救出来，走上了社会主义光明大道。现在自己好了疮疤忘了疼，为了几个工分就撂鞭子不干，这不是忘本又是啥呢？想到这里，刘永茂眼泪止不住地往外流。他激动地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫这个坏蛋把我弄糊涂了，他象白菜地里的蛆一样，尽往根上咬，专往心里烂，他想用工分拉我们下水，让我们顺着‘私线’滑到资本主义老道，这可办不到！”
    夜深了，斗私批修会在“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”的歌声中结束了。
    事隔不久，刘永茂赶大车去海城，他装好了车，本想到街上办点私事，歇一宿再回去。可是他想到毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，想到生产队正在农忙，觉得自己的想法不对头。他想：个人的事再大是小事，公家的事再小是大事，公和私的斗争一会也停不得，有私就得斗，不斗就是对毛主席不忠。于是，他不顾疲劳，星夜赶路。平日三天半的路程，一天半就赶了回来。社员们知道这件事后，都建议给他记三天半的工分，可是刘永茂说啥也不要，他说：“这工分，不能要，要多给我记了工分，就是多给我添了私心。”事后，他在讲用会上说出了自己的心里话：“车靠人来赶，人靠毛泽东思想来武装。同样的一根鞭子赶车，走的可是两条道。现在，自己头脑里有了毛泽东思想，用这根鞭子赶车，走的是毛主席指引的社会主义光明大道。”
