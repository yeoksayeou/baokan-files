Edition: 1

The great leader Chairman Mao said: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Recently, we visited several rural people's communes and held more than ten discussion meetings with poor and lower-middle peasants, teachers, and cadre members of the production brigades and communes. We gained a lot from these meetings. Our overall impression is that after the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the education revolution, a vigorous education revolution movement has rapidly emerged in the vast rural areas of the entire province. As long as Mao's instructions are conveyed to the poor and lower-middle peasants, the education revolution in the countryside is not difficult. Problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable have now been resolved.

I

Why are the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants dissatisfied with the old education system? Why do so few of their children attend school, and why do so many drop out or repeat grades? The poor and lower-middle peasants have given clear answers:

An old poor peasant said: "In the past, they always said our children were stupid, not as clever as the children of landlords and rich peasants. This is sheer nonsense. There is a landlord's son in our brigade. When he comes back from school, his father tells him: 'You just bury your head in your books. Our family status is not good, and I have no future in this society. You have to study hard to become an official and have a future.' Isn't this telling his child to carry on the landlord class? When my second son comes back from school, he hasn't even put down his schoolbag, and I tell him: 'Go do some work. You've been studying for six hours, it's time to work.' Our poor peasants' descendants should be both literate and skilled. If a poor peasant's child can't do manual labor, I feel ashamed."

One is studying to become an official; the other is to be both literate and skilled, to be a laborer with socialist consciousness and culture. These are two different requirements for raising children from two different classes and standpoints. Therefore, the old poor peasant angrily said: "The education system of the Chinese Khrushchev is precisely aimed at those who bury their heads in books. The school rules are all for such people, specifically for them to advance and become officials. You tell me, for which class is this system designed?"

Another poor peasant added: "That's not all. They drive our children out of school and say our children are naughty and disobedient. What nonsense! Who listens to whom? Being obedient means listening to Chairman Mao. Our children don't want to be subjected to that bourgeois stuff, they rebel against it. But the children of landlords and rich peasants love this old education system. In the past, the capitalist roaders pointed at us and scolded us for being disobedient, 'troublemakers,' saying that landlords and rich peasants are 'obedient and hardworking.' Isn't this the same logic!"

A returned educated youth said: "Not only are poor and lower-middle peasants' children restricted from attending school, but those who do attend are only allowed to memorize books, without connecting with production or practical work. They learn useless things and ignore useful ones. After twelve years of schooling, they come back home and find it dirty, and they find farm work tiring. They learn algebra and geometry but can't do accounting; they can't even calculate a terrace field. They learn chemistry and physics but can't tell the difference between pesticides and fertilizers, and they don't even dare to change a light bulb. My father always scolds me for becoming a useless good-for-nothing because of studying."

Another poor peasant said: "We used to wonder why, in the new society, schools that admit poor and lower-middle peasants' children produce graduates who forget their roots. My son graduated and came back. He always thought he had become a superior person and looked down on me, walking with his neck held high. This time, Chairman Mao sent the poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the schools, and we found out that the schools are still the domain of the bourgeoisie, and there are still landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists among the teachers! In our production team, even when hiring a livestock keeper, we have to choose the most reliable poor and lower-middle peasants. If our children are taught by those people, how can they not be corrupted! When it comes to such an education system, it makes my lungs burst with anger."

Some people say that poor and lower-middle peasants are illiterate and can't lead the education revolution. In reality, poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought understand and hate the old education system the most, and their criticism of the revisionist education line is the strongest and most accurate.

II

For decades, Chairman Mao has issued a series of great instructions on the education revolution. Why have they not been implemented? Why does rural education still serve the bourgeoisie? The poor and lower-middle peasants have also given clear answers:

An old land reform committee chairman said: "Chairman Mao's voice couldn't be heard because there was a Chinese Khrushchev blocking the way. The education revolution couldn't be carried out because we poor and lower-middle peasants had no power."

A deputy brigade leader said: "In the past, the poor and lower-middle peasants had mountains of complaints about the schools, but they couldn't be resolved because we had no say. The poor and lower-middle peasants have long proposed, 'Don't build big school buildings in the county or commune, but build them in the brigades.' But the capitalist roaders wouldn't do it. There was a remnant of the Kuomintang in the central school who specifically persecuted the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. We proposed to replace him, but he was a 'state cadre' under the county's jurisdiction, and we couldn't move him. After arguing a few times, it still couldn't be resolved."

A primary school teacher said: "The poor and lower-middle peasants have raised many opinions about the school, and we also wanted to change, but we weren't allowed to. One year, the crops in the brigade were parched, and the masses demanded that we stop classes to combat drought. We asked the central school, and the central school asked the county, and the reply was: 'If it affects the college entrance examination, you will be fully responsible.' As a result, we didn't dare to take a holiday. But the private schools all took a holiday to combat drought, precisely because the private farming and reading schools were under the jurisdiction of the brigades and managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants."

As for the curriculum content being detached from reality and production, and the propagation of feudalism and revisionist black goods, there was a lot of it, but Mao Zedong Thought was not taught. The poor and lower-middle peasants had the biggest opinions on this matter and had long raised them. Because the power of education was in the hands of the capitalist roaders and so-called educational "authorities" above, they did not implement Chairman Mao's instructions, so it could never be resolved.

The old land reform committee chairman said: "This time, Chairman Mao let us poor and lower-middle peasants manage the schools, solving the power issue. This resolves the fundamental issue of the education revolution. We listen to Chairman Mao, and the education revolution will definitely be successful."

III

After criticizing the old education system, what direction should rural schools take in the future? The poor and lower-middle peasants said: It is to firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," truly putting the power of education in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and having the poor and lower-middle peasants exercise political leadership over the schools. It is to use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the schools and cultivate successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat.

A poor and lower-middle peasant said: "Managing schools is a big deal. Since the beginning of time, it has never been heard of that poor and lower-middle peasants would manage schools. Chairman Mao saw our hearts. He thought the farthest, and this is a big deal to ensure that our descendants will never change color. Otherwise, we knock down a batch of capitalist roaders, knock down a batch of bourgeois and revisionist elements, and then the schools produce a batch of revisionist elements for you. This won't do! Therefore, the first condition for the education revolution is that the power of the schools must be firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

A commune cadre said: "We have public schools and private farming and reading schools. From the perspective of the teaching staff, serving the poor and lower-middle peasants and combining with productive labor, and from the perspective of the students' political quality, the private farming and reading schools are better than the public schools, the primary schools are better than the middle schools, and the brigade primary schools are better than the commune central schools. This is precisely because the private primary schools are managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigades. The commune central schools and middle schools are far from the poor and lower-middle peasants and far from productive labor, so they are not welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants."

In the southern part of Liaoning, there is a Pine Tree Brigade. In 1964, the poor and lower-middle peasants started their own farming and reading primary school. Everyone selected the most trusted teachers from the returned educated youth. There was no funding, no school building, and it was completely supported by the poor and lower-middle peasants. It developed from fourteen students to one hundred and fifty-five students, becoming more and more prosperous. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade all praised this school, giving it a thumbs up.

An old livestock keeper said: "Our school didn't spend a penny of the state's money, and the students didn't pay tuition fees. The poor and lower-middle peasants didn't spend a penny either. It was all the teachers leading the students to participate in collective labor, and the brigade gave some work points. The teachers and we are of one mind, teaching students to be devoted to the collective from a young age and to work hard. Whatever new instructions Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issue, the teachers teach them to the students, letting the students go home to propagate them. We hear about domestic and international events from the children. The school not only teaches children but also teaches adults."

An old poor peasant said: "This school considers everything for us. There are no school buildings, so the school is set up in the production team, in the blacksmith's forge, in the fields, and on the kang (bed). Our brigade is in a mountain valley divided into four points, and the teachers run around teaching. They don't let the students run far, and we are at ease. Whether six or seven years old, or seventeen or eighteen years old, as long as you want to study, the teachers will teach you. There are no dead rules like in foreign schools."

Another poor peasant said: "Chairman Mao gave a lecture at Yan'an for the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and Vice Chairman Lin was the principal. At that time, there were no beautiful classrooms. Didn't they just bring a small stool and write notes on their knees? But they trained so many good cadres for our country."

The teacher, Xujingfang, who is deeply loved by the poor and lower-middle peasants and is the daughter of a poor peasant, said: "Setting up this school was a struggle. We have nothing here, and the county and commune look down on us. But we have one of the best conditions: the strong support of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The class struggle course is taught by old poor peasants, livestock keeping is taught by livestock keepers, cart driving is taught by cart drivers, and farming is taught by poor peasants. I only teach some culture and help organize. If I am the students' teacher, those old poor peasants and livestock keepers are my teachers. Every time I encounter difficulties and waver, it is these best teachers who use Mao Zedong Thought to educate, encourage, support, and demand of me. Without them, I can't do anything."

The old livestock keeper finally said: "Say a thousand, say ten thousand, this school is good because from the beginning of its establishment, it was the poor and lower-middle peasants who held the power. Recently, Chairman Mao said that schools should be managed by us. I think our school is the most in line with Mao Zedong Thought, and this is the direction for rural education."

The poor and lower-middle peasants said it so well! They love and are loyal to Chairman Mao the most, and they have the most proletarian feelings. The direction of education in the Pine Tree Brigade is the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao. Such schools truly have the power of the poor and lower-middle peasants, truly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, and truly combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Such schools carry forward the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, being hardworking and plain, connecting with reality, connecting with productive labor, and truly cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Such schools also set an example for intellectuals to combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants and receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Comrades like Xujingfang, along with the brigade's accountant and livestock keeper, have completely become ordinary commune members responsible for education work in the countryside. Such schools have also become an important battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, popularizing culture, and cultivating a new generation in the countryside.

    农村教育革命调查纪实
    《辽宁日报》调查员
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”
    最近，我们走了几个农村人民公社，和贫下中农、教员、社队干部一起，开了十几个座谈会，收获不小，总的印象是：毛主席关于教育革命的一系列最新指示发出后，一个蓬蓬勃勃的教育革命运动已在全省广大农村迅速兴起。只要把毛主席的指示和贫下中农见面，农村的教育革命并不很难，过去以为无法解决的问题，现在已经解决了。
    一
    为什么广大贫下中农对旧的教育制度不满意？为什么贫下中农的孩子上学的少，退学、留级的多呢？贫下中农做了明确的回答：
    一位老贫农说：“过去总说咱们的孩子笨，比不上地富子女灵俐，这纯粹是瞎扯。队里一个地主儿子放学回家，他爹对他说：‘你埋头抠书本就行了。咱家成份不好，在这个社会我是没有出头之日了，就得指望你念书得了一官半职好出头’。这不是叫他的孩子给地主阶级传宗接代吗？！咱那二小子回家，书包还没撂下，我就说：‘去干点活去，念了六个钟点的书了，该劳动劳动了。’咱贫农的后代要文武双全，贫农的孩子不会干活，我总觉得丢人。”
    一个是念书为当官出头；一个是要文武双全，做有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者，这是两个阶级从两个根本不同的立场所提出的两种培养后代的要求。所以那位老贫农气愤地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫的教育制度偏偏相中了死抠书本，学校的规矩都是为这号人开门，专为这号人升学当官服务的，你说这号制度是为那个阶级定的？”
    另一个贫农接着说：“这还不算，把咱们孩子从学校赶出来，还说咱们孩子淘，不听话，见他的鬼吧！到底是谁听谁的话？听话要听毛主席的话，这才是听话。咱孩子不愿受资产阶级那一套夹板气，造他们的反，可地富子女却对这个旧教育制度打心眼喜欢。过去走资派指着咱鼻子骂咱们贫下中农不听话，是‘刺头’，说地富‘老实肯干’，这不是一个道理吗！”
    一个回乡知识青年说：“限制贫下中农子女上学还不算，上了学的只让死啃书本，不联系生产，不结合实际。有用的不学，没用的学一大堆。念了十二年书，回家嫌家脏，下地嫌活累。学了代数几何不会当会计，改个梯田还不会算；学了化学物理，农药化肥分不开，连安个灯泡都不敢，我爹总骂我念书念成了窝囊废。”
    一个贫农社员接着说：“原先咱们总琢磨不透，为啥新社会办的学校，进去的是贫下中农子弟，出来就忘了本。我儿子毕业回来，他总觉得自己成了上等人，倒嫌我脏，走路都仰着脖子。这回毛主席派贫下中农去管学校，才知道学校里还是资产阶级的地盘，教员里还有地富反坏右呢！咱们生产队里，找个饲养员还要选最可靠的贫下中农，咱们孩子归那些家伙教，教不坏才怪呢！提起这样的教育制度，把咱的肺都要气炸了。”
    有人讲贫下中农是大老粗，一个大字不识，怎么能搞教育革命。实际呢？用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农对旧的教育制度最了解，最痛恨，对修正主义教育路线的批判最有力，最准确。
    二
    几十年来，毛主席有一系列关于教育革命的伟大指示，为什么落实不了？为什么农村教育还是为资产阶级服务？贫下中农也做出了明确的回答：
    一个土改时的老农会主任说：“毛主席的声音传不下来，就是有中国赫鲁晓夫在当间横着。教育革命总是搞不成，就是因为咱们贫下中农没有权。”
    一个大队副主任说：“过去贫下中农对学校的意见能堆成山，可就解决不了，就是因为咱们说了不算。贫下中农早就提出，‘不要老在县里、公社里给学校盖大楼，还是到大队里来办’，可走资派不干。中心学校有个国民党残渣余孽当老师，专门迫害贫下中农子弟，咱们提出撤换他，可人家是归县里管的‘国家干部’，咱们搬不动，吵吵几次也解决不了。”
    一个小学教员说：“贫下中农对学校提过很多意见，咱们也想改，可就不让改。有一年队里庄稼旱得冒烟，群众要求我们停课抗旱，我们请示中心校，中心校请示县里，答复说：‘要是影响升学考试，你要负全部责任’。结果，就是没敢放假。可人家民办的学校都放假抗旱了，就是因为民办的耕读学校的权在大队，归贫下中农管。”
    至于课程内容脱离实际，脱离生产，宣扬封建主义、修正主义黑货更是不少，可就是不讲毛泽东思想。贫下中农对这事的意见最大，早就提过。因为教育大权在上面走资派和所谓教育界“权威”手中，他们根本不贯彻毛主席的指示，所以总也解决不了。
    老农会主任说：“这回毛主席让咱贫下中农管理学校了，把权给解决了，这可解决了教育革命的根本，咱们听毛主席的话，教育革命一定能搞好。”
    三
    批判了旧的教育制度，今后农村的学校坚持什么方向？贫下中农说：就是要坚决落实毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示，把教育大权真正掌握在贫下中农手中，由贫下中农对学校实行政治领导，就是要用毛泽东思想去占领学校，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    一个贫下中农社员说：“管理学校可是个大事，从打开天辟地以来，就没听说让贫下中农去管理学校。毛主席他老人家看到咱心里去了，他老人家想得最远，这是保证咱们子孙万代不变色的大事。要不然，咱们打倒一批走资派，打倒了一批资产阶级、修正主义分子，将来学校又给你造出一批修正主义分子，这还得了！所以教育革命第一条就非得把学校的大权牢牢掌握在贫下中农手里不可。”
    一个公社干部说：“我们这里有公办学校，也有民办和耕读学校，从教师队伍看，从为贫下中农服务和与生产劳动结合来看，从学生的政治质量来看，都是民办的耕读的比公办的强，小学比中学强，大队的小学比公社的中心学校强。就是因为民办的小学，大队贫下中农有权管。公社的中心学校、中学离贫下中农很远，离生产劳动很远，所以就不受贫下中农欢迎。”
    在辽南有个松树大队，一九六四年贫下中农自己办起个耕读小学，大伙从回乡知识青年中选出了自己最信任的老师。一没有经费，二没有校舍，完全靠贫下中农的支持，从十四个学生发展到一百五十五名学生，越办越兴旺，大队贫下中农一提这个学校，都伸出大拇指，赞不绝口。
    一个老饲养员说：“咱们这个学校没花国家一分钱，学生上学也不交学费，贫下中农也没花一分钱，全是老师带着学生参加集体劳动，大队给点工分。老师和咱们一样，上一天课记一天的分。那老师真正和咱们是一个心眼，教出的学生也带劲，学生从小就学会一心为集体，就学会干活。毛主席、党中央、中央文革有什么新指示，老师就教给学生，让学生回家来宣传。国内外的大事，我们都从孩子那里听来。学校不光教小孩，连大人也教了。”
    一个老贫农说：“这学校处处为咱们着想，没有校舍，把学校办到生产队，办到铁匠炉，办到地头，办到炕头上去了。我们这个大队在山沟里分四个点，老师到处跑着教书，不让学生跑远路，咱可省心哩。六、七岁也好，十七、八岁也好，只要你想学习，老师就教。没有洋学校那套死规矩。”
    另一个贫农社员讲：“毛主席在延安给抗大讲课，林副主席当校长，那时哪有什么漂亮教室啊？还不是自己带了个小板凳，在膝盖上写笔记吗？可是为咱们国家教出了那么多的好干部。”　
    深受贫下中农欢迎的老师、贫农的女儿徐靖芳同志说：“办这个学校是经过一番斗争的，咱们这里要啥没啥，县里、公社都看不起。可咱们有一条最好的条件，就是贫下中农的大力支持。阶级斗争课请老贫农讲，讲饲养牲口就请饲养员，讲大车就请车老板，讲农活也是请贫下中农，我只是教点文化，帮助组织一下。如果说我是学生的老师，那些老贫农、老饲养员就是我的老师。每当我遇到困难，有些动摇时，就是这些最好的老师用毛泽东思想教育我、鼓励我、支持我、要求我。离开他们，我就啥也干不成了。”
    老饲养员最后讲：“说一千，道一万，这个学校办得好，就好在从开始办学就是咱们贫下中农掌权。最近毛主席讲了，学校由咱们来管，我看咱们的学校最符合毛泽东思想，这就是农村办学的方向。”
    贫下中农说的多好啊！他们对毛主席最热爱，最忠诚，最有无产阶级感情，松树大队办学的方向，就是毛主席指出的方向。这样的学校真正由贫下中农掌权，真正为贫下中农服务，真正和贫下中农结合在一起了。这样的学校发扬了抗大的作风，艰苦朴素，联系实际，联系生产劳动，真正是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。这样的学校也给知识分子与贫下中农相结合，受贫下中农的再教育做出了榜样。象徐靖芳这样的同志，和队里的记工员、饲养员一样，完全成了在农村负责教育工作的一名普通社员。这样的学校也就成了农村宣传毛泽东思想，普及文化，培养一代新人的一个重要阵地。
