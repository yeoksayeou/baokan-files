Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: “A person has arteries and veins, and through the heart, blood circulates. They also need to breathe through the lungs, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is what is meant by expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without removing waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lack vigor.” Chairman Mao’s latest instructions represent a major development in Marxism-Leninism’s theory of party building and are a great guideline for the construction of proletarian parties. We must fully implement and resolutely carry out these instructions.

Chairman Mao is the great leader of the working class and has always attached great importance to party building within the working class. I recall that during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, Chairman Mao often affectionately instructed us: “The revolutionary leading class is the working class.” This helped us understand that the working class is the most progressive class, especially industrial workers, who have nothing and rely entirely on their labor. They suffer the most oppression from imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and feudal bosses, have the deepest hatred, and are the most resolute and thorough in their revolution. With the leadership of the working class, the revolution is bound to be victorious.

During the turbulent years of war, Chairman Mao paid great attention to party building within the working class. Whenever he arrived at a place, he would always find ways to contact the workers, hold discussions with them, learn about the situation of party organizations among the workers, and enthusiastically encourage workers to study Marxism-Leninism and actively create conditions to join the party. Under Chairman Mao’s wise leadership, the Red Army at that time particularly emphasized recruiting workers into the party and often paid attention to bringing outstanding industrial workers into the party. Under Chairman Mao’s affectionate care, many workers from places like Changsha, Guangzhou, and the Anshan coal mines who joined the Red Army participated in party organizations, and many comrades took on the role of party representatives, becoming excellent party cadres. At that time, our old platoon leader Hu Chunbao was one of them. This worker-turned-Communist Party member had a firm class stance, fought resolutely against the enemy, and was awarded several times in battle. The higher-ups wanted him to be a platoon leader, but he said, “Being a platoon leader or not doesn’t matter. I’m here to revolutionize, as long as I can protect Chairman Mao!” Later, he heroically sacrificed himself on the Long March. He often told us, “You are all Communist Party members, revolutionize to the end, protect Chairman Mao well, and the revolution will definitely be victorious!” For many years, the great image of this proletarian revolutionary fighter has been deeply engraved in our hearts, inspiring me to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and forever follow Chairman Mao’s lead.

Chairman Mao taught us: “The working class has the greatest foresight, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution.” During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class fully played its leading role. The working class has the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao and follows Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployments the most closely. In our execution of the “three supports, two militaries” tasks in places like the Nanchang New China Printing Factory, we saw the advanced elements of the working class holding high the banner of “It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries,” launching fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies, smashing the counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and seizing back the power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, firmly holding it in the hands of the working class. After the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels, the working class representatives who joined the work of the revolutionary committees remembered Chairman Mao’s teaching: “The victory of the revolution nationwide is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li.” They studied and applied Chairman Mao Zedong Thought more earnestly, worked harder, and stood firm and unyielding in class struggle. In April this year, a handful of class enemies stirred up a wind of attempting to overthrow the provincial revolutionary committee in Nanchang. At the critical moment of struggle, the working class stood up, bravely defending Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and protecting the newly born revolutionary regime.

The worker representatives participating in the work of the provincial revolutionary committee have always maintained the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity. Some workers, after becoming members of the provincial revolutionary committee and deputy directors, are very busy with work but still often return to the factory to participate in labor and insist on walking to and from work. From these outstanding elements of the working class, we see the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought and the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution.

Chairman Mao taught us: “The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against class enemies.” Only by implementing Chairman Mao’s proletarian line of party building, recruiting a batch of outstanding rebels, first and foremost industrial workers, into the party, and selecting outstanding Communist Party members to participate in the leadership of party organizations at various levels, can we ensure that party organizations at various levels are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, and pass on Chairman Mao’s line of party building from generation to generation.

    积极吸收工人阶级中的先进分子入党
    江西省革命委员会常委六七九七部队部队长  陈昌奉
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”毛主席的最新指示是对马克思列宁主义关于建党学说的重大发展，是无产阶级政党建设的伟大纲领。我们一定要全面落实，坚决照办。
    毛主席是工人阶级的伟大领袖，一贯重视工人队伍中党的建设。记得在第二次国内革命战争时期，毛主席经常亲切地教导我们：“革命的领导阶级是工人阶级”。使我们开始懂得工人阶级是最进步的阶级，特别是产业工人，他们一无所有，完全依靠双手劳动。他们受到帝国主义、资产阶级和封建把头的压迫，苦最大，仇最深，革命最坚决，最彻底。有了工人阶级的领导，革命就一定能胜利。
    在战火纷飞的年月里，毛主席非常关怀工人队伍中党的建设问题。每到一地，总是设法接触工人群众，同他们开座谈会，了解工人中党组织的情况，非常关心地问有多少工人？有多少是党员？热情鼓励工人努力学习马列主义，积极创造条件，加入党的组织。在毛主席的英明领导下，当时红军特别重视吸收工人出身的同志入党，经常注意把优秀的产业工人吸收到党里来。在毛主席的亲切关怀下，当时从长沙、广州和安源煤矿等地参加红军的许多工人参加了党的组织，很多同志担任了党代表，成了党的优秀干部。当时，我们警卫班的老班长胡春保同志就是其中的一个。这位工人出身的共产党员阶级立场坚定，对敌斗争坚决，战斗中立了几次功，上级要他担任排长，他却说：“当不当排长没有啥，我是来革命的，只要保卫好毛主席就行了！”后来，他在长征路上英勇地牺牲了。他经常对我们说：“你们都是共产党员，要革命到底，好好保卫毛主席，革命就一定胜利！”多少年来，这位无产阶级革命战士的伟大形象，一直铭刻在我们的心窝里，鼓舞着我永远忠于毛主席，永远跟着毛主席前进。
    毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，工人阶级充分发挥了领导作用。工人阶级对毛主席的感情最深，对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得最紧。我们在南昌新华印刷厂等单位执行“三支”“两军”任务中，看到工人阶级的先进分子高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，向一小撮阶级敌人发起了猛烈的进攻，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的反扑，把党内一小撮走资派所窃取的权力夺了回来，牢牢掌握在工人阶级自己手里。各级革委会成立后，进入革委会工作的工人群众的代表，牢记毛主席“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步”的教导，更加认真地活学活用毛泽东思想，更加努力工作，在阶级斗争中站得稳，顶得住。今年四月间，一小撮阶级敌人在南昌市刮起了一股妄图颠覆省革委会的妖风。在斗争的关键时刻，工人阶级挺身而出，勇敢捍卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫了新生的革命政权。
    参加省革委会工作的工人代表，始终保持着艰苦朴素的优良作风。有的工人当上了省革委会常委、副主任后，工作非常忙，仍经常回厂参加劳动，上下班坚持走路。我们从这些工人阶级的优秀分子身上，看到了毛泽东思想的无比巨大威力，看到了无产阶级彻底革命的精神。
    毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”只有执行毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，吸收一批优秀的造反派，首先是产业工人中的先进分子入党，选拔优秀的共产党员参加各级党组织的领导工作，才能保证各级党组织忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，并且使毛主席的建党路线代代相传。
