In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great socialist motherland, with an even more majestic appearance, has entered its glorious twentieth year.

On this grand national holiday of joy and celebration, we, with profound proletarian feelings, wish our great leader Chairman Mao a long life! We extend our warmest congratulations and revolutionary greetings to the working class, the leading class of our country, to the workers' representatives from all over the country who have come to attend the National Day celebrations, to the most reliable ally of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants, to the staunch pillar of the proletarian dictatorship—the People's Liberation Army, to the broad masses of Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, and to the revolutionary people of all nationalities!

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, after more than two years of the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have overthrown the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in various places, and have seized back the part of the leadership power they usurped. Now, except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions throughout the country. The proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses have further firmly grasped the destiny of the state in their own hands. Our proletarian dictatorship state is more consolidated, more powerful, and more full of vitality.

As Chairman Mao has pointed out, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. The great victory of this revolution has brought about profound revolutionary changes in all aspects of our country, including politics, ideology, economy, and culture.

The latest instructions of Chairman Mao and the commands of the proletarian headquarters have never been spread so rapidly among the hundreds of millions of people and turned into their conscious actions as they are today. The revolutionary people of all nationalities throughout the country have never been so firmly united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and are fighting bravely to carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The broad revolutionary masses, tempered through the great criticism and repudiation, have greatly heightened their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and the two roads. They firmly uphold the socialist road, detest the capitalist road, and regard the struggle against revisionism as their most important combat task.

The proletarian dictatorship's leading class—the working class, with the participation and support of the People's Liberation Army of China, has led a vast army of industrial workers to take the lead in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all fields of the superstructure, and is further changing the appearance of schools and places where intellectuals congregate.

The People's Liberation Army of China, which has made great contributions in the "three supports and two militaries," has carried forward the glorious tradition of being both a fighting force and a work team and a production team, has strengthened its flesh-and-blood ties with the people, and has become a steel wall defending the country, defending the proletarian dictatorship, and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals are full of vigor and enthusiasm, fighting spirit, and are grasping the revolution, promoting production, work, and preparedness, and have brought about a new leap-forward situation in all fronts of our country's industry, agriculture, science and technology, and revolutionary literature and art.

The great situation of daily progress and prosperity that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought to our great motherland is so inspiring! How happy and glorious it is for us to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao!

With the establishment of revolutionary committees throughout the country, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new period, that is, to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "To establish a three-in-one revolutionary committee, to carry out great criticism, to clean up the class ranks, to rectify the Party, to streamline organizations, to reform unreasonable rules and regulations, to transfer office staff, and to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories, generally go through these stages." Chairman Mao's instruction is the basic content and fundamental way for the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all units, all departments, and all organs.

The struggle, criticism, and transformation is to take Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, to carry out thorough and universal reforms on all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base in accordance with the proletarian image; it is to block the channels for the production of revisionism politically, ideologically, economically, and organizationally, to consolidate and develop our proletarian dictatorship, and to consolidate and develop the socialist economic base of our country.

The working class must lead everything. Chairman Mao said that the proletariat must exercise full dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the superstructure, including all cultural fields. The working class sends worker propaganda teams, in cooperation with the army, directly into schools and into all fields of the superstructure, to combine with the revolutionary activists there, to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation there. This is a great strategic deployment summarized by Chairman Mao from the masses' experience. Through revolutionary practice, it has been proven and will continue to be proven that this is a great innovation in the history of the proletarian revolution.

The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class. The leading role of the working class is realized through the leadership of the Communist Party. In the struggle, criticism, and transformation, we must place the rectification and building of the Party in a very important position.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemy." This is our great program for rectifying and building the Party. We must, in close connection with the current class struggle, mobilize the broad masses to participate in the rectification of the Party.

It is necessary to seriously clean up the class ranks as the basis for our rectification and building of the Party. We must definitely do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks. In the process of cleaning up the class ranks and in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, we must resolutely expel those traitors, spies, all counter-revolutionaries, and die-hard capitalist roaders with conclusive evidence, in order to purify the Party's ranks and to ensure the gradual implementation of Chairman Mao's various great instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction. We must actively and cautiously absorb a batch of outstanding proletarian revolutionary rebels who have been tempered and tested in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially the advanced elements among industrial workers, to join the Party organization, so as to inject fresh blood into the Party and enhance its fighting capacity. We must select Party members who have firmly stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and revolutionary cadres who have a firm proletarian stand and revolutionary spirit, to participate in the leadership work of the Party's primary organizations and various levels of Party committees.

Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Communist Party of China and the great leader of the working class and the broad masses of laboring people. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of our Party. Mao Zedong Thought most concentratedly expresses the wisdom of the working class and summarizes the experience of the struggle of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary people. To unify our thinking, policies, steps, and actions in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought is the leadership of the working class. To follow Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is to be invincible.

On the occasion of celebrating the nineteenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we deeply thank all the true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of all countries for their support for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Chinese people will never disappoint everyone's expectations. Today, a new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun. The heroic people of Albania, standing on the front line of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, have made great contributions to the international communist movement. The great anti-U.S. war of national salvation of the Vietnamese people, the thriving national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the extensive revolutionary mass movements in Western Europe and North America are developing in depth. The contradictions of U.S.-led imperialism are increasing, and its political and economic crises are deepening. The modern revisionist group led by the Soviet revisionist traitors is in disarray and disintegrating. The days of the reactionaries of various countries bred by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are getting worse. The great struggle of the revolutionary people of the world greatly inspires the Chinese people who are advancing to victory. We must better fulfill our internationalist duties of the proletariat, learn from the revolutionary struggle experience of the people of all countries in the world, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.

The more we are in the good situation of victory, the more we must be vigilant against arrogance and impetuosity. We must never forget the class struggle and never be complacent. We must always be alert and maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance. We must be ready at any time to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all enemies who dare to invade our country! We must definitely liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan!

Let the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their running dogs tremble before the seven hundred million Chinese people tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Let us raise the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought higher, complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and forge ahead on the road to victory in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    在胜利的大道上奋勇前进
    ——热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》社论
    在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，我们伟大的社会主义祖国，以更加雄伟的面貌，进入了光辉的第二十个年头。
    在举国欢庆的盛大节日里，我们怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，敬祝我们的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！我们向我国的领导阶级——工人阶级，向来自全国各地参加国庆观礼的工人代表，向工人阶级的最可靠的同盟军——贫下中农，向无产阶级专政的坚强柱石——人民解放军，向广大红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，向各族革命人民，致以热烈的祝贺和战斗的敬礼！
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，我们打倒了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人，夺回了被他们所篡夺的那一部分领导权。现在，全国除台湾省外的各省、市、自治区全部成立了革命委员会。无产阶级和广大革命群众把国家的命运进一步牢固地掌握在自己的手里。我们无产阶级专政的国家，更加巩固，更加强大，更加生气勃勃了。
    正象毛主席所指出的，无产阶级文化大革命，是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命。这个大革命的伟大胜利，使我国在政治、思想、经济、文化等各方面，发生了深刻的革命变化。
    毛主席的最新指示，无产阶级司令部的号令，从来没有象今天这样迅速地在亿万群众中传播，变成他们的自觉行动。全国各族革命人民，空前坚定地团结在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，为执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而英勇斗争。
    经过革命大批判锻炼的广大革命群众，大大地提高了两条道路、两条路线斗争的觉悟，他们坚持社会主义道路，憎恨资本主义道路，把反修防修作为最重要的战斗任务。
    无产阶级专政的领导阶级——工人阶级，在中国人民解放军的参加和支持下，开出了浩浩荡荡的产业工人大军，领导上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改，正在进一步改变学校和一切知识分子成堆地方的面貌。
    在“三支”“两军”中作出伟大贡献的中国人民解放军，发扬了既是战斗队又是工作队、生产队的光荣传统，增强了同人民群众的血肉联系，成为保卫国防、保卫无产阶级专政、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的钢铁长城。
    广大的工人、农民和革命知识分子，意气风发，斗志昂扬，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，使我国的工业、农业、科学技术、革命文艺等各个战线出现了新的跃进局面。
    无产阶级文化大革命给我们伟大祖国带来的日新月异、蒸蒸日上的大好形势，是多么令人欢欣鼓舞啊！我们能够参加毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是多么幸福，多么光荣啊！
    随着全国各地革命委员会的普遍建立，无产阶级文化大革命进入了新的时期，这就是遵照毛主席的伟大教导，认真搞好斗、批、改。
    毛主席指出：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”毛主席这一指示，是一切单位，一切部门，一切机关斗、批、改的基本内容和根本途径。
    斗、批、改，就是以毛泽东思想为指针，按照无产阶级的面貌，对一切不适合社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，实行彻底的、普遍的改革；就是从政治上、思想上、经济上、组织上堵塞产生修正主义的渠道，巩固和发展我国的无产阶级专政，巩固和发展我国的社会主义经济基础。
    工人阶级必须领导一切。毛主席说，无产阶级必须在上层建筑其中包括各个文化领域中对资产阶级实行全面的专政。工人阶级派出工人宣传队，在解放军的配合下，直接进入学校，进入上层建筑的各个领域，同那里革命的积极分子结合起来，领导那里的斗、批、改，这是毛主席总结了群众经验提出的伟大战略部署。通过革命实践，已经证明，并将继续证明，这是无产阶级革命史上的伟大创举。
    中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队。工人阶级的领导作用，是通过共产党的领导来实现的。在斗、批、改中，我们要把整党、建党，放到非常重要的地位。
    毛主席指出：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”这是我们整党建党的伟大纲领。我们要按照毛主席的这个指示，紧密结合当前的阶级斗争，发动广大群众参加整党。
    认真地清理阶级队伍，是我们整党、建党的基础。一定要切切实实做好清理阶级队伍的工作，在清理阶级队伍中，在斗、批、改中，要把那些证据确凿的叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子和顽固不化的走资派，坚决清除出去，才能纯洁党的队伍，才能保证毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的各项伟大指示逐步实现。要积极、慎重地吸收一批经过文化大革命锻炼和考验的优秀的无产阶级革命造反派战士，首先是产业工人中的先进分子参加党的组织，使党输入新鲜血液，增强战斗力。要选拔在无产阶级文化大革命中坚决站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线上的共产党员，有坚定的无产阶级立场和革命朝气的革命干部，参加党的基层组织和各级党委的领导工作。
    毛主席是中国共产党的伟大领袖，是工人阶级和广大劳动人民的伟大领袖。毛泽东思想是我们党的指导思想。毛泽东思想最集中地表达了工人阶级的智慧，概括了无产阶级和广大革命人民的斗争经验。按照毛泽东思想统一认识，统一政策，统一步伐，统一行动，这就是工人阶级的领导。紧跟毛主席，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，就能无往而不胜。
    在欢度中华人民共和国成立十九周年的时候，我们深切地感谢全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者和各国革命人民对我国无产阶级文化大革命的支持。中国人民决不会辜负大家的期望。今天，一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经开始了。站在反帝反修前线的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，为国际共产主义运动作出了伟大的贡献。越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲蓬蓬勃勃的民族解放运动，西欧、北美广泛的革命群众运动，正在深入发展。以美国为首的帝国主义矛盾重重，政治经济危机日益深重。以苏修叛徒为首的现代修正主义集团互相倾轧，分崩离析。美帝、苏修豢养的各国反动派的日子越来越不好过。世界革命人民的伟大斗争，极大地鼓舞了正在胜利前进的中国人民。我们一定要更好地履行无产阶级国际主义义务，学习世界各国人民的革命斗争经验，坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    越是在胜利的大好形势下，越是要戒骄戒躁。千万不能忘记阶级斗争，千万不能麻痹大意。一定要保持清醒的头脑，保持高度的革命警惕。我们要随时准备坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭一切敢于侵犯我国的敌人！我们一定要解放祖国的神圣领土台湾！
    让美帝、苏修和他们的走狗们，在经历了无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民面前发抖吧！
    更高地举起马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大道上，奋勇前进！
