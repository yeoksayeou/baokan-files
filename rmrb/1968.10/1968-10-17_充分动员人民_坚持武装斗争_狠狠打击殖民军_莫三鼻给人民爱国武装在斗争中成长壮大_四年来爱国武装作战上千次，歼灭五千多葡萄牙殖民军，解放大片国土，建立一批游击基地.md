The armed forces of the Mozambican people, in their struggle for national liberation, have grown stronger and more numerous over the past four years. They have engaged in over a thousand battles, annihilated more than five thousand Portuguese colonial troops, liberated vast areas of land, and established several guerrilla bases.

The spark of revolution can ignite a prairie fire. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to resolve problems through war." On September 25, 1964, after thorough preparation, a small group of Mozambican freedom fighters launched a surprise attack on a small town called Chai in the northern province of Delgado, killing three Portuguese colonialists. The gunshots at Chai announced to the world: After nearly five centuries of Portuguese colonial rule, the Mozambican people, after a long and arduous struggle, have finally taken up arms, determined to fight for the complete liberation of Mozambique.

Over the past four years, the Mozambican armed forces have grown from small to large, from weak to strong. They have engaged in over a thousand battles, annihilated more than five thousand Portuguese colonial troops, liberated vast areas of land, and established several guerrilla bases. They have also destroyed more than ten enemy strongholds, shot down thirty-six enemy planes, blown up five enemy train engines, destroyed hundreds of enemy vehicles, and seized a large amount of light and heavy weapons, ammunition, communication equipment, and various military supplies.

The Mozambican armed forces are most active in the northern provinces of Delgado and Niassa, bordering Tanzania. They have liberated 57,000 square miles of land (one-fifth of the country's total area) and freed more than a million Mozambican Africans out of a total of 7.5 million. In these two provinces, the Portuguese colonial army has lost the initiative in the war and is now holed up in their strongholds.

In March of this year, the Mozambican armed forces opened a new front in the northwestern province of Tete, bordering Zambia. Tete is rich in mineral resources. The Portuguese colonialists are planning to build a huge hydroelectric power station in the Cabora Bassa region on the Zambezi River, intending to settle a large number of Portuguese immigrants and build a "dam" to prevent the flames of the Mozambican people's armed struggle from spreading south. The opening of the Tete front will surely shatter the Portuguese colonialists' delusions.

Revolutionary war is a war of the masses. The broad masses of Mozambican guerrillas have increasingly come to realize that revolutionary war is a war of the masses. In their struggle, they pay attention to mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses. In the rural areas of the guerrilla bases, they have organized broad-based militia units. In peacetime, militia soldiers participate in agricultural production, and when the enemy invades, they take on the task of defending the village. They also provide transportation, intelligence, and supplies for the guerrillas. Militia soldiers also do political work, mobilizing and organizing farmers in various villages. The broad masses of Mozambican militia soldiers have become a bridge for the armed forces to maintain close ties with the masses and a powerful backing for defeating the enemy.

Under the brutal colonial rule of Portugal, Mozambican women suffer the deepest oppression. They harbor deep hatred for the national enemy, and their resolve for revenge is unshakable. Therefore, brave Mozambican women play an important role in the liberation struggle. Many Mozambican women not only mobilize their husbands and brothers to join the guerrilla forces but also strongly demand to take up arms to annihilate the enemy. In 1967, the first women's detachment of the Mozambican armed forces was established.

The brave Mozambican guerrillas cultivate the land with the local farmers in the guerrilla bases. In areas with fewer residents, they clear the land and farm themselves. After the Mozambican armed forces led the people in the guerrilla bases to develop production, the military and civilian population in the Mozambican guerrilla bases can now export some economic crops to neighboring independent African countries, exchanging them for clothing, medicine, and other daily necessities.

The Mozambican armed forces learn war from war. After four years of revolutionary struggle, their combat effectiveness has continuously improved, and their tactics have also been continuously upgraded. In the early stages of the struggle, the Mozambican armed forces adopted a highly flexible and mobile small-unit combat form. They used the dense African jungles as natural cover, harassed enemy strongholds, ambushed enemy patrols, laid mines, blew up bridges, and sabotaged enemy supply lines. As their own strength grew, the scale of the armed forces' battles also expanded. In 1967, the guerrilla units developed to the point of fighting in platoon formations. This year, the armed forces have already been able to engage in larger-scale battles in company formations.

The Mozambican guerrillas have an increasingly deep understanding of the significance of concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy's effective combat strength.

In March, a group of guerrillas, with twice the enemy's strength, attacked the Portuguese colonial military stronghold in Nambuti, Delgado Province. The guerrillas bravely charged, annihilating nearly an entire company of defending enemy troops, seizing a mortar and a large amount of weapons and ammunition.

On the morning of August 10, the armed forces in Delgado Province launched a fierce attack on the Portuguese colonial air force base in Mueda. They used mortars to destroy twelve enemy planes, blew up the airport fuel depot and several military vehicles, achieving a great victory. At the same time, the tactics of the armed forces have also been continuously developed, and the battles are becoming more and more clever and flexible.

On November 18 of last year, a company of Portuguese colonial troops stationed at the Nangololo stronghold in Delgado Province attempted to sneak attack a Mozambican guerrilla base. However, the guerrillas had already obtained intelligence about the enemy's activities from the local people. They chose a favorable position, set up an ambush, and waited for the enemy to fall into the trap. When the foolish enemy entered the ambush, the guerrillas opened fire, killing fifteen colonial troops. The remaining enemy fled in disarray. When the enemy retreated to a small village near their stronghold, they were ambushed again and suffered even heavier casualties. It turned out that this group of guerrillas, after completing the first ambush, quickly took a shortcut and set up a second ambush on the enemy's retreat route.

One day in mid-June, the armed forces in Niassa Province laid mines on a road, destroying two Portuguese colonial military vehicles and killing ten enemy troops. Before the guerrillas withdrew, they cleverly laid mines around the destroyed vehicles. When a group of Portuguese colonial troops came to reinforce, they stepped on the mines and were blown to pieces. By then, the guerrillas had already returned to their base.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." The broad masses of Mozambican armed forces deeply understand that their enemies are not only Portuguese colonialism but also the vicious American imperialism. Therefore, they must not harbor any illusions of easy victory. The struggle is long and arduous. However, they emphasize that even if their liberation struggle lasts twenty or thirty years, they will definitely persist in the struggle to the end and win the final victory.

Under the fierce impact of the Mozambican people's armed struggle, the Portuguese colonialists, in order to maintain their precarious colonial rule, are struggling more desperately and cunningly. The public enemy of the world's people, American imperialism, seeing its interests in southern Africa seriously threatened, has further tightened its "aid" to the fascist Salazar regime in Portugal. On the one hand, it provides more money and weapons, and on the other hand, it directs its henchmen in southern Africa—the white racist regime in South Africa—to directly send troops to Mozambique to suppress the people's struggle there.

    充分动员人民  坚持武装斗争  狠狠打击殖民军
    莫三鼻给人民爱国武装在斗争中成长壮大
    四年来爱国武装作战上千次，歼灭五千多葡萄牙殖民军，解放大片国土，建立一批游击基地
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　本社记者报道：今年九月二十五日，是莫三鼻给人民为推翻葡萄牙殖民统治而掀起如火如荼的民族解放战争的四周年纪念日。四年来，莫三鼻给人民爱国武装在斗争中不断发展壮大，歼灭了大量敌人，解放了大片国土和人民，取得了一个接一个的胜利。
    星星之火，可以燎原
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”一九六四年九月二十五日，经过充分准备之后，一小队莫三鼻给自由战士，向北部德尔加多角省的一座名叫沙伊的小镇上的葡萄牙殖民主义者发动了突然袭击，打死了三名葡萄牙殖民主义者。沙伊的枪声向全世界宣布：遭受葡萄牙殖民统治近五个世纪的莫三鼻给人民，在经过长期艰苦曲折的反抗之后，终于走上武装斗争的道路，决心拿起枪杆子，争取莫三鼻给的彻底解放。
    四年来，莫三鼻给爱国武装由小到大，由弱到强，作战上千次，歼灭了五千多名葡萄牙殖民军，解放了大片国土，建立了一批游击基地。他们还摧毁了十多个敌军据点，击落敌机三十六架，炸毁五部敌军火车头，击毁数百辆敌人军车，缴获了大量的轻重武器、弹药、通讯联络器材和各种军用物资。
    莫三鼻给爱国武装力量在莫三鼻给北部与坦桑尼亚毗邻的德尔加多角省和尼亚萨省，最为活跃。已经在这两个省解放了五万七千平方英里的土地（占全国总面积的五分之一），并解放了七百五十万莫三鼻给非洲人中的一百多万人。在这两个省，葡萄牙殖民军目前已失去了战争的主动权，龟缩在他们的据点中。
    今年三月份，莫三鼻给爱国武装又在莫三鼻给西北部与赞比亚接壤的太特省开辟了新战场。太特省矿产资源很丰富。葡萄牙殖民主义者正计划在这个省的卡布拉巴萨地区赞比西河上建立一个巨大的发电站，阴谋安置大量葡萄牙移民，建立一个“堤坝”，阻止莫三鼻给人民武装斗争的烈火向南蔓延。太特省战线的开辟，必将粉碎葡萄牙殖民主义者的这一妄想。
    革命战争是群众的战争
    莫三鼻给广大游击战士，越来越认识到，革命战争是群众的战争。他们在斗争中，注意动员群众，依靠群众。他们在游击基地的农村，广泛组织了民兵队伍。平时，民兵战士参加农业生产，敌人侵犯时，就担当起保卫村庄的任务。他们还为游击战士作交通，提供情报，运送弹药和给养。民兵战士还做政治工作，负责动员和组织各村的农民群众。莫三鼻给的广大民兵战士，已成为爱国武装与群众保持密切联系的桥梁，成为战胜敌人的强大后盾。
    在葡萄牙野蛮的殖民统治下，莫三鼻给妇女受的压迫最为深重。她们对民族敌人怀有深仇大恨，她们复仇的决心坚定不移。因此，勇敢的莫三鼻给妇女，在解放斗争中起着重要作用。许多莫三鼻给妇女不但动员自己的丈夫、兄弟参加游击队，本人也强烈要求拿起武器消灭敌人。一九六七年，莫三鼻给爱国武装第一支妇女支队建立起来了。
    英勇杀敌的莫三鼻给游击战士，在游击基地同当地农民一起耕种土地。在居民较少的地方，就自己开荒种田。在莫三鼻给爱国武装领导游击基地的人民大力发展生产后，莫三鼻给游击基地的军民已经可以把一部分经济作物出口到邻近的非洲独立国家，换回被服、药品和其它生活用品。
    从战争学习战争
    莫三鼻给爱国武装在战争中学战争，经过四年来的革命斗争锻炼，战斗力不断加强，战术也在不断提高。莫三鼻给爱国武装在斗争的最初阶段，采取了高度灵活机动的小分队作战形式。他们利用茂密的非洲丛林作天然屏障，骚扰敌人据点，伏击敌人巡逻队，埋地雷，炸桥梁，破坏敌人交通线。随着自己力量的壮大，爱国武装组织的战斗规模也不断扩大。一九六七年，游击队发展到以排为单位进行战斗。今年，爱国武装已经能以连为单位进行规模更大的战斗了。
    莫三鼻给游击战士对集中优势兵力打歼灭战、消灭敌人有生力量的意义也有了越来越深刻的认识。
    今年三月，一队游击战士以两倍于敌人的兵力，袭击了德尔加多角省楠布迪的葡萄牙殖民军据点，游击战士勇猛冲杀，一举歼灭了近一个整连的守敌，缴获了一门迫击炮和其它大量武器弹药。
    今年八月十日清晨，德尔加多角省的爱国武装，对姆韦达的葡萄牙殖民军空军基地发动了猛烈的袭击，用迫击炮击毁了十二架敌机，炸毁了机场油库和数辆军车，取得了重大的胜利。与此同时，爱国武装的战术也不断发展，仗打得越来越巧妙灵活。
    去年十一月十八日，驻在德尔加多角省楠戈洛洛据点的一连葡萄牙殖民军企图偷袭莫三鼻给爱国武装的一个游击基地。但是游击队早已从老百姓那里得到了敌人活动的情报。他们选择了有利地形，设下了埋伏，等待敌人落网。当愚蠢的敌人进入伏击圈后，游击战士即猛烈开火，击毙了十五名殖民军，其它的敌人抱头鼠窜。当敌人逃到离他们据点不远的一个小村庄附近时，又遭到第二次伏击，受到更惨重的伤亡。原来，这一队游击战士在打完第一次伏击后，就迅速抄近路，在敌人退路上安排了第二次埋伏。
    六月中旬的一天，尼亚萨省的爱国武装在一条公路上埋设地雷，炸毁了两辆葡萄牙殖民军汽车，炸死了十名敌人。游击战士撤离前，又巧妙地在被炸毁的汽车周围布置了地雷。一队葡萄牙殖民军赶来增援时，踩响了地雷，被炸得狼狈不堪。这时，游击队却早已返回基地了。
    一定要把斗争坚持到底
    在莫三鼻给人民武装斗争的猛烈冲击下，葡萄牙殖民主义者为了维持它岌岌可危的殖民统治，正在进行着更为疯狂和狡猾的挣扎。世界人民的公敌美帝国主义，看到它在非洲南部地区的利益受到严重威胁，也更加紧了对葡萄牙萨拉查法西斯政权的“援助”。它一方面提供更多的金钱和武器，一方面指使它在南部非洲的打手——南非白人种族主义政权，直接派兵到莫三鼻给，镇压那里的人民斗争。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”广大的莫三鼻给爱国武装战士深深懂得，他们所面临的敌人不仅是葡萄牙殖民主义，而且是凶恶的美帝国主义。因此，绝不能抱有轻易取胜的幻想。斗争是长期的、艰苦的。但是他们强调指出，即使他们的解放斗争要持续二十年、三十年，他们也一定要把斗争坚持到底，赢得最后胜利。（附图片）
