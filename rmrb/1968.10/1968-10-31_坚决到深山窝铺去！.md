	Resolutely Go to the Deep Mountains!

	Xiao Qiao entered Shanxi Jinan Medical College in 1960. Xiao Qiao's family, generation after generation, had been laboring for the landlords and herding sheep, and never had anyone in the family gone to school. It was under Chairman Mao's leadership that the poor peasants overturned their oppressive conditions, allowing Xiao Qiao to have the opportunity to study. Before leaving for school, his father repeatedly instructed him, "Today, you can go to school; this is all thanks to Chairman Mao. Never forget your roots and strive to make the poor peasants proud." At the beginning of his studies, Xiao Qiao still maintained the sentiments of the working people. However, after coming to the medical college, the more books he read, the more he was poisoned by the revisionist educational line, and the further his thoughts and feelings drifted from the poor peasants. This was especially evident in the issue of graduation assignment, where he was unwilling to go to the deep mountains and hardships.

	Xiao Qiao's thoughts were discovered by Old Li, a member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the school. Old Li thought, "It is the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev that has poisoned the youth, causing Xiao Qiao to forget the working people. The Chinese Khrushchev has pushed the youth onto the black road of revisionism, and we, the working class, must pull them back onto Chairman Mao's revolutionary path." Following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "class struggle, grasp it and all problems will be solved," Old Li used his own bitter family history to educate Xiao Qiao, who came from a poor peasant family. Old Li recalled, "In the old society where people were devoured, where was there a way out for the poor? It was Chairman Mao who led us poor people to overturn our oppressive conditions and live a happy life, allowing children like you from poor families to have the opportunity to study. However, some people, after studying for more than ten years, forget their roots and are unwilling to go to the countryside or to hardship-stricken places. Does this do justice to Chairman Mao?" Old Li's heartfelt words touched Xiao Qiao's sore spot. He recalled his father's repeated instructions before he went to school and, with tears of remorse, said, "Teacher Li, I was wrong. I did not listen to Chairman Mao's words, forgot my roots, and let down the working class, the poor peasants, and especially Chairman Mao!" Old Li solemnly said, "The people have supported you to graduate from medical college, but you are unwilling to serve the people and go to the deep mountains! Do you know how many poor peasants are waiting for you? Some patients are waiting for you to treat them?" The old worker's words were deeply engraved in Xiao Qiao's heart. He excitedly said to Teacher Li, "I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely go to the deep mountains, go to the most difficult places, go to where the poor peasants need us the most, accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly reform my thoughts, and serve the poor peasants in the countryside for life."

	With his ideological problems resolved, Xiao Qiao happily wrote a determination letter to the school, expressing his resolve to go to the deep mountains.

    坚决到深山窝铺去！
    小乔一九六○年考入了山西晋南医专。小乔他家祖祖辈辈都是给地主家扛活，放羊，从来没有一个念书的。是毛主席领导贫下中农翻了身，小乔才得到了上学的机会。临上学时父亲一再嘱咐他：“今天你能够上学，这是托毛主席他老人家的福啊！千万不要忘本，要为咱贫下中农争气。”刚开始上学，小乔还保持着劳动人民的感情。自从来到医专，书是越读越多，修正主义教育路线的毒害也接受得越多，他的思想感情离贫下中农也就越远了。特别表现在毕业分配问题上，不愿到深山窝铺艰苦的地方去。
    小乔的思想被驻校工人毛泽东思想宣传队的老李发现了。李师傅想，是中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线对青年人的毒害，使小乔忘了劳动人民。中国赫鲁晓夫把青年人推向了修正主义的黑路，我们工人阶级就是要把他拉回到毛主席的革命路线上来。李师傅遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的伟大教导，用自己血泪斑斑的家史来教育贫农家庭出身的小乔。李师傅回忆道：“在那吃人的旧社会，那有我们穷人的活路。是毛主席领导我们穷人翻了身，过上了幸福生活，象你们这些穷人的孩子才得到了上学的机会。可是，有的人读了十几年书，就忘了本，不愿到农村、到艰苦的地方去，这对得起毛主席吗？”李师傅语重心长的一段话，触动了小乔的痛处，他回想起临上学前父亲对自己的一再嘱咐，沉痛地流着眼泪说：“李师傅，我错了，是我没有好好听毛主席的话，忘了本，我对不起工人阶级，对不起贫下中农，更对不起毛主席！”李师傅很严肃地说：“人民把你供养到医专毕业，你却不愿为人民服务，不愿到深山窝铺去！你知道那里有多少贫下中农在盼望着你们？有的病人在等待着你们去看病？”老工人的话句句铭刻在小乔的心里，他激动地对李师傅说：“我一定听毛主席的话，坚决到深山窝铺去，到最艰苦的地方去，到贫下中农最需要的地方去，接受工农兵的再教育，很好地改造思想，在农村为贫下中农服务一辈子。”
    思想问题解决了，小乔愉快地向学校写了到深山窝铺去的决心书。
