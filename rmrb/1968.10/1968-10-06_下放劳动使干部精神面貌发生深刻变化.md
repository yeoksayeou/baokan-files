In the new period of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued another extremely important new directive: "A large number of cadres should be sent down to labor, which is an excellent opportunity for them to re-learn. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also be sent down in batches to labor." This brilliant directive is so timely! It perfectly expresses the thoughts of us cadres. It is a beacon illuminating the path for us cadres, a new weapon for thoroughly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and a long-term strategy for preventing revisionism. All the cadres in our county were deeply moved after hearing it. On the very night the directive was issued, the county revolutionary committee and the cadres of the county-level organs immediately beat drums and gongs to send a joyous report to the expanded meeting of the provincial revolutionary committee being held here. Cadres who had already settled down in the countryside also expressed their determination to the revolutionary committee, vowing to seize this excellent opportunity to re-learn, consciously accept re-education from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and dedicate their lives to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Following the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," our county has made some achievements in streamlining organizations and sending down cadres. The organizational structure of the county revolutionary committee has been streamlined from the original three departments and seventeen groups at its establishment to the political department and the department for promoting production in revolution, with the number of staff reduced from 124 to 40, a reduction of 87% compared to the original county committee and county people's committee. The 51 enterprises and institutions under the county have been merged into 14, with personnel reduced by 40%. We adopted the "three-in-one" method of streamlining, merging, and sending down, sending down more than 380 cadres who were streamlined, except for the old, weak, sick, disabled, and a few who were assigned to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level, to the countryside in batches to settle down and build new socialist rural areas with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The cadres who remained in the revolutionary committee also implemented the "three-thirds" system, with one-third of the personnel staying at home to handle work, one-third going out to the countryside, and one-third staying in the production teams to labor.

A large number of cadres in Fenyi County have been sent down to labor for a short period, but their appearance has undergone profound changes. Under the influence of the old organizations, cadres who had long been detached from the masses, detached from reality, and detached from labor, once they came into contact with the masses, found that they had indeed changed. A cadre of worker origin, who used to live a simple life and love labor in the countryside, became increasingly estranged from the poor and lower-middle peasants after entering the organization due to long-term detachment from labor. After being sent down, he deeply felt: "In the past, I was afraid to go to the production teams, demanding better living conditions, less work, lighter tasks, higher positions, and more power. If I hadn't been sent down quickly, my revolutionary spirit would have gradually faded away." Some cadres who went from home to school to the organization and had little or no contact with the workers and peasants, this time went to the countryside and entered the doors of the poor and lower-middle peasants, receiving warm welcomes and enthusiastic help from the masses. Many community members took their hands, teaching them how to plow and wield the hoe. Comparing their past cold attitude towards the poor and lower-middle peasants, they sighed deeply: "From the three doors to the door of the poor and lower-middle peasants, this time I truly touched the door of revolutionization." Two cadres from the former county people's committee who had made mistakes, carrying heavy ideological burdens, went to the countryside. One said: "My big-character poster was all over the streets, my prestige was ruined. This time, I'll go to the countryside to be a clean farmer for a while." The other said: "I'll work hard and be an 'honest' community member for a while." They went to the countryside with a try-it-out attitude, with no intention of settling down. However, when they arrived at the commune, brigade, and production team, the community members welcomed them with drums and gongs. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the production team specially organized a heart-to-heart talk for them, sincerely telling them that making mistakes was nothing to worry about, as long as they corrected them sincerely, the poor and lower-middle peasants would welcome them. They never expected the poor and lower-middle peasants to be so enthusiastic in caring for and helping them, and both were moved to tears. The next day, they walked 90 li back to the county city, moving their entire families to this production team to settle down. They expressed: They would definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, not disappoint the poor and lower-middle peasants' expectations, and strive to transform their thoughts in collective production labor, striving to do new deeds for the people.

Streamlining administration and sending down cadres is a sharp and complex class struggle. We must fight against the class enemies, fight against old habits, and fight against the "self" in our minds. Without fighting against these obstacles, organizations cannot be streamlined, cadres cannot be sent down, and even if they are sent down, they cannot put down their "official" airs. In our work of sending down cadres to labor, we encountered the frenzied sabotage of class enemies. They saw us streamlining organizations and sending down cadres to strengthen our ties with the broad masses of the people, so they tried every means to sow discord between cadres and the revolutionary committee, and between cadres and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, attempting to obstruct cadres from going down to labor and temper themselves. Just as a large number of cadres were eager to go to the countryside, a handful of class enemies spread rumors, saying that "sending down cadres is the revolutionary committee trying to unload 'burdens,' striking at a large number of people, and promoting a new bourgeois reactionary line." In the countryside, a handful of class enemies also instigated, saying, "Send down, send down, those who don't make mistakes won't be sent down." Due to the sabotage of class enemies, the work of sending down cadres from some organs and units in Yangjiang Commune progressed slowly. Later, those enemies who sabotaged the streamlining of administration were exposed, and the political awareness of the cadres was raised, so the work was smoothly carried out. Practice has proven that the work of sending down cadres is a sharp struggle between public and private interests, a thorough ideological revolution that touches the soul. This struggle is concentrated on the issue of whether to be an official or serve the people. Some people think: "After streamlining the organization, it's not good to stay in the organ, and it's not good to go to the countryside." Some people are not voluntarily requesting to be sent down, but feel that "the trend is inevitable, and one cannot help but follow." A few people even think: "It's better for cadres to go back home than to be farmers." In solving these ideological problems of cadres, we have taken some detours. At first, we adopted the method of "closing the door to criticize oneself." The cadres of the former county committee and county people's committee held four sessions of streamlining administration study classes, and because it was "closing the door to criticize oneself," it often happened that "they spoke well in the meeting, but their thoughts returned after the meeting." Later, we moved the streamlining administration study classes to the countryside, letting the cadres stay with the poor and lower-middle peasants, jointly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev in the construction of political power, listening to the poor and lower-middle peasants' voices on streamlining administration, and accepting re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest understanding of Chairman Mao's directives, the deepest hatred for the old organizations, and the greatest dissatisfaction with cadres being detached from labor and the masses. These had a great impact on the cadres. Some cadres deeply felt: "Closing the door to criticize oneself is not thorough; opening the door to criticize oneself is thorough." At the same time, we also adopted the method of combining criticism with practice, criticizing the bourgeois ideology of cadres who can be officials but not citizens, can go up but not down, and sending down cadres who had not gone to the countryside for a long time to the countryside to stay in the production teams, making them taste the sweetness of going deep into reality in the process of contacting the poor and lower-middle peasants. This laid a good ideological foundation for the large-scale sending down of cadres to labor.

The reason why our county's work of sending down cadres achieved some results in a short period is due to the large-scale mass movement. Chairman Mao teaches: "A great revolutionary upsurge is needed to arouse tens of thousands of people and form a great force." The power of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants played a great role in promoting the work of sending down cadres. At the beginning, we also carried out a few small-scale send-downs, with small momentum, low enthusiasm, and slow progress. Recently, we have been vigorously promoting the great significance of sending down cadres throughout the county, quickly forming a "three-struggle" enthusiasm among the cadres to struggle to be sent down, struggle to go to the most arduous places, and struggle to be farmers for life to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants for life. In the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, there is also a warm welcome for the sent-down cadres. Many communes and brigades sent people to the county to request the sending down of cadres to their places, some wrote letters to the revolutionary committee to request, and some even welcomed with drums and gongs. All the communes and brigades in the county prepared houses for the sent-down cadres to settle down. All these gave the cadres great encouragement.

In practice, we also deeply felt that sending down cadres is a key link in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the organs. Seizing this key link and breaking through this bottleneck has a great promoting effect on the revolutionization of the organs. Why did the struggle, criticism, and transformation of some enterprises and institutions in our county progress slower than that of the county revolutionary committee? It is because they only merged the organizations but did not send down the cadres. For example, the five major companies in the commercial system were merged for a period, but because the streamlined personnel were not sent down, as a result, the number of idlers increased, the number of bureaucratic issues increased, and even the normal business hours could not be guaranteed. The poor and lower-middle peasants criticized: "The idols are not moved away, the temples cannot be demolished, and your cadres should have been sent down long ago!" Later, these units streamlined and sent down at the same time. The sent-down personnel were educated by the masses and quickly reflected the opinions and demands of the masses about their units, thus greatly promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation of these units. Practice has proven: firmly grasping this link of sending down cadres is not only beneficial to accelerating the thought revolution of cadres but also beneficial to promoting the revolutionization of the organs, which is a key measure to promote the overall struggle, criticism, and transformation.

    下放劳动使干部精神面貌发生深刻变化
    江西分宜县革命委员会
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入斗、批、改的新时期中，我们伟大领袖毛主席又发出了极为重要的最新指示：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”这一光辉指示下达得多么及时啊！完全说出了我们广大干部的心里话。它是照耀广大干部前进的光辉灯塔，是全面搞好斗、批、改的最新武器，也是反修防修的百年大计。我们全县广大干部听了以后，万分激动。毛主席最新指示发表的当天晚上，县革委会和县直机关的干部就敲锣打鼓，向正在这里召开的省革命委员会扩大会议送喜报。已经到农村安家落户的干部，也纷纷向革委会表决心，一定要紧紧抓住这个重新学习的极好机会，自觉地接受工农兵的再教育，一辈子和工农兵结合，一辈子为工农兵服务。
    遵循伟大领袖毛主席“精兵简政”的伟大教导，我们县在精简机构、下放干部方面，已经取得了一些成绩。县革委会的机构设置已经由刚成立时的三部十七个组，精简为政治部和抓革命促生产指挥部两个部，工作人员由一百二十四名减少到四十名，比原县委、县人委的工作人员减少了百分之八十七。县属五十一个企业、事业单位，也合并成了十四个，人员精简了百分之四十。我们采取边精简、边撤并、边下放的“三边”办法，把精简下来的三百八十多名干部，除老弱病残和少数充实基层领导外，都已分批下放到农村安家落户，和那里的贫下中农一起参加文化大革命，一起建设社会主义新农村。留在革委会工作的干部，也实行了“三三制”，三分之一的人员在家主持工作，三分之一的人员跑面，三分之一的人员蹲点劳动。
    分宜县大批干部下放劳动，时间虽然不长，干部的面貌却发生了深刻的变化。在旧机构的影响下，长期脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离劳动的“三脱离”干部，一接触到群众，就发现自己的确变了。有个劳动人民出身的干部，过去在农村，生活朴实，热爱劳动，到了机关由于长期脱离劳动，和贫下中农的感情越来越淡薄了。这次下放以后，他深有体会地说：“过去高高在上怕蹲点，生活要求好一点，工作要求少一点，任务要求轻一点，职务要求高一点，权力要求大一点，要不是这次下得快，革命气味就慢慢地没有了。”有些从家门到学校门到机关门的没有或很少接近工农群众的“三门”干部，这次下到农村，走进了贫下中农的门，受到群众的热烈欢迎和热情帮助。许多社员拉着他们的手，教他们扶犁、掌耙，他们对比自己过去对待贫下中农的冷淡态度，感慨万分地说：“由三门迈进了贫下中农的门，这回真正摸到了革命化的门”。原县人委有两个犯了错误的干部，背着沉重的思想包袱下农村，一个说：“我的大字报上了街，威信扫了地，这回下农村，作一个时期干干净净的农民。”另一个说：“我发狠干，当一个时期‘老老实实’的社员。”他们抱着试试看的思想，根本没有到农村安家落户的打算。可是，当他们一到公社、大队、生产队，社员们就敲锣打鼓欢迎，生产队贫下中农还特地给他们组织了谈心会，诚恳地对他们说，犯错误有什么要紧，只要认真改了，我们贫下中农就欢迎。他们万万没想到贫下中农会这样热情地关怀他们，帮助他们，这两个干部都感动得热泪盈眶。第二天，他们步行九十里赶回县城，把全家都迁到了这个生产队，安家落户。他们表示：一定要听毛主席的话，不辜负贫下中农的期望，决心在集体生产劳动中接受贫下中农的再教育，努力改造思想，为人民立新功。
    精兵简政，下放干部，是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，要和阶级敌人斗，和旧的习惯势力斗，和头脑里的私字斗。不斗倒这些拦路虎，机构简不了，干部下不去，下去也放不下“官”架子。我们在干部下放劳动工作中，遇到了阶级敌人的疯狂破坏，他们看到我们精简机构，下放干部，加强与广大人民群众的联系，就千方百计地从各个方面来挑拨干部和革命委员会的关系，挑拨干部和广大贫下中农的关系，妄图阻拦干部下放劳动锻炼。正当大批干部要求到农村去时，一小撮阶级敌人就散布流言蜚语，说什么“干部下放是革委会要卸‘包袱’，是打击一大片，推行新的资产阶级反动路线。”在农村，一小撮阶级敌人还挑拨说：“下放，下放，不犯错误的不会放”。洋江公社由于阶级敌人的破坏，一些机关、单位干部下放工作迟迟进展不了。后来，把那些破坏精兵简政的敌人揪了出来，干部提高了政治觉悟，工作才顺利地开展起来。实践证明，干部下放工作，是一场尖锐的公与私的斗争，是一场触及灵魂的思想大革命，这个斗争集中表现在是做官当老爷，还是为人民服务的问题上。有的认为：精简机构后，“留在机关不好办，下到农村不好看”。有的不是自觉地要求下放，而是感到“大势所趋，不能不随”。个别人甚至认为：“干部下放当农民不如干脆回家”。我们在解决干部这些思想问题时，曾经走过一些弯路。开始我们采取了干部“关门斗私”的办法。原县委、县人委的干部，先后办了四期精兵简政学习班，由于是“关门斗私”，因此往往出现“会上讲得好听，会后思想返生”。后来，我们把精兵简政学习班搬到农村去办，让干部和贫下中农在一起，共同批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线，听取贫下中农对精兵简政的呼声，接受贫下中农的再教育。广大贫下中农对毛主席的指示理解最深，对旧的机构最痛恨，对干部脱离劳动、脱离群众最不满。这些对干部触动很大，有些干部深有体会地说：“关门斗私，斗不彻底；开门斗私，才能斗彻底。”与此同时，我们还采取了大批判和实践相结合的方法，一方面狠批干部能“官”不能民，能上不能下的资产阶级思想，一方面把长期没有下乡的干部放到农村去蹲点，使他们在和贫下中农接触的过程中，尝到深入实际的甜头，这就为干部大批下放劳动打下了良好的思想基础。
    我们县下放干部的工作所以能在很短时间内取得一定成绩，是由于大搞群众运动的结果。毛主席教导说：“须有一个大的革命热潮，才能鼓动成千成万的群众，形成一个大的力量。”广大贫下中农的力量在促进干部下放工作中起了很大作用。开始我们也搞了几次小规模的下放，声势不大，热气不高，进展不快。最近，我们在全县大讲特讲了干部下放的伟大意义，很快在干部中形成了一个争下放、争到最艰苦的地方、争当一辈子农民，为贫下中农服务一辈子的“三争”热潮，在广大贫下中农中，也出现了一个热烈欢迎下放干部的热潮。许多公社、大队派人到县里来，要求把干部下放到他们那里去，有的写信到革委会来请求，有的还敲锣打鼓来迎接，全县社社队队贫下中农都为下放干部准备了安家落户的房子。这些都给干部极大的鼓舞。
    我们在实践中还深深体会到，干部下放是机关斗、批、改的重要关键之一。抓住了这个关键，突破了这个口子，对机关的革命化有很大的促进作用。我们县有些企业、事业单位的斗、批、改，为什么进展得比县革委会慢，就是因为只裁并了机构却没有下放干部。比如商业系统的五大公司，有个时期虽然合并了，但因为精简的人员还没有下放，结果，逍遥派增多了，扯皮的事增多了，正常的营业时间都不能保证。贫下中农批评说：“菩萨不搬走，破庙拆不了，你们的干部早该下放了！”后来，这些单位边精简、边下放，下去的人员在群众中受到教育，又迅速地把群众对本单位的意见、要求反映上来，这样，就大大促进了这些单位的斗、批、改。事实证明：狠抓干部下放这一环，不仅有利于加速干部思想革命化，也有利于促进机关革命化，是推进整个斗、批、改的关键措施。
