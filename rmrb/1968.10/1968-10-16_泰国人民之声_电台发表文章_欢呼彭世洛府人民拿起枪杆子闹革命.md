	"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 14th, enthusiastically celebrating the people of Phetchabun Province in central Thailand rising up to launch armed revolutionary struggle. The article points out that for a long time, the Thanom–Prapas co-sellout clique has been brutally oppressing and exploiting the people of Phetchabun Province. Rent, usury, and various taxes, along with natural disasters, have plunged the people of Phetchabun Province into a hellish life. The Thanom–Prapas clique also forcibly seizes farmers' land and, under various pretexts, drives the ethnic minorities of Phetchabun Province into concentration camps for persecution. Recently, the Thanom–Prapas clique has intensified its savage repression of the people of Phetchabun Province and arrested a batch of people.

	The article states, as the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has pointed out: "The various forms of oppression and slaughter inflicted on the people by the reactionaries in the course of their rule will, in the long run, only serve to hasten the counter-revolution." The long-simmering anger in the hearts of the people of Phetchabun Province has finally erupted. On September 30, the people of this province began armed struggle, severely punishing a reactionary village head in the Nakhon Thong District, and fiercely attacking the reactionary police sent to suppress the people, causing the U.S.-Thai reactionary clique to be extremely frightened. They are further plotting to suppress the armed struggle of the people of Phetchabun Province. The article points out that the armed struggle of the people of Phetchabun Province is just, and it has received the enthusiastic support of the people throughout the country. This flame of struggle will only burn more fiercely, and no force can stop it.

    欢呼彭世洛府人民拿起枪杆子闹革命
    新华社十五日讯  “泰国人民之声”电台十四日广播一篇文章，热烈欢呼泰国中部彭世洛府人民奋起开展革命武装斗争。文章指出，长期以来，他侬—巴博卖国集团对彭世洛府人民进行着残酷的压迫和剥削。地租、高利贷和苛捐杂税以及自然灾害，使彭世洛府人民生活在水深火热之中。他侬—巴博集团还强占农民的土地，并以种种借口把彭世洛府的少数民族赶进集中营，进行迫害。最近，他侬—巴博集团变本加厉地对彭世洛府人民进行疯狂的镇压，并逮捕了一批人。
    文章说，正如世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所指出：各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。埋在彭世洛府人民胸中的怒火终于爆发了，九月三十日，这个府的人民开始了武装斗争，在那空泰县严惩了一名反动村长，并痛击了前往镇压人民的反动警察，使美泰反动集团非常害怕。它们正在进一步策划镇压彭世洛府人民的武装斗争。文章指出，彭世洛府人民的武装斗争是正义的，得到全国人民热烈支持，这个斗争烈火必将越烧越旺，任何力量都无法阻挡。
