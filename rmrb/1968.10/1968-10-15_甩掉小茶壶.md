		Shake Off the Little Teapot

		After Zhang Zhengjun from the technical department of Benxi Nanfen Machine Repair Factory was assigned to the workshop, he was placed next to the veteran worker, E Xianchang. E, the master, was very concerned about this new "neighbor" and often went over to observe his operations. When he saw that Zhang was not very skilled at handling the lathe, he would give him some pointers. What surprised E was that there was a small teapot next to Zhang's lathe. Zhang would wipe his hands from time to time, pick up the teapot to "moisten his throat," and praise, "Good tea! Good tea!" E immediately realized: Little Zhang not only came down from the office to the workshop, but also brought the old office style to the workshop. This is a dangerous trend! E saw Zhang pick up the teapot again and said meaningfully, "Drinking too much tea is not a big deal, but don't get confused, okay." Zhang was still savoring the tea aroma when E spoke, his eyes scanned around, and he saw that none of the workers had brought a teapot; they were all concentrating on their operations. He felt very uncomfortable.

		The evening shift bell rang. E walked to Zhang's lathe, took the teapot, and placed it in front of Zhang. They sat shoulder to shoulder and studied Chairman Mao's teachings together: "We Communists are revolutionary, and we must have a spirit of thorough revolution for all time. We must never be off guard against the enemy." Then E spoke earnestly, "This time, Chairman Mao called you to come to the workers and be with us to grasp revolution and promote production, to receive re-education from the working class. But you brought the old office style here. This little teapot is small, but it contains the fierce struggle between the two lines. If you show off like this in the workshop, you will only drift further away from the workers!" Zhang heard this and thought, "That's right! In the past, when I was a worker, I didn't bring a teapot to work. But later, when I went to the office, my butt never left the chair, and my hand never left this little teapot. As a result, I drifted further and further away from the workers. If I continue like this, it's very dangerous!" Thinking of this, Zhang was moved and decided to thoroughly change his old ways and honestly accept re-education from the workers. From then on, the little teapot was no longer seen during work hours.

    甩掉小茶壶
    本溪南芬机修厂技术科的张正君下到车间以后，被分配在老工人鄂贤昌旁边劳动。鄂师傅对这位新来的“邻居”很关心，时常过去看看他的操作，见他摆弄床子不大顺手时，就给他指点指点。使鄂师傅意外的是，在张正君的车床旁还放着一把小茶壶。张正君过一会就擦擦手，拎起来“润一润”，嘴里还连声赞曰“好茶！”“好茶！”鄂师傅马上觉察到：小张不光人从科室下到车间来了，连旧科室的作风也从科室带到车间来了，这可是条危险的路子啊！鄂师傅见张正君又拎起了茶壶，便意味深长地说：“茶喝多了不要紧，可别灌迷糊了啊。”张正君正在品着茶香，听鄂师傅一说，眼睛向四周一转，见工人谁也没带茶壶，都在聚精会神地操作着，心里很不是滋味。
    晚上下班铃响了。鄂师傅走到张正君车床前，抓过那把茶壶往跟前一放，和张正君肩并肩地坐下，一块学习了毛主席教导：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”接着鄂师傅语重心长地说：“这次，毛主席他老人家叫你们下到工人中间来，是叫你们和咱工人一起抓革命、促生产，接受工人阶级再教育。可你却把旧科室那套老爷作风带来啦，这把茶壶虽小，可里面装着两条路线的激烈斗争啊。你这样在车间里摆阔气，就会越摆离工人越远！张正君一听，可不是吗？过去自己当工人的时候，并没有拿着茶壶上班呀！可是后来进了科室，屁股不离沙发、转椅，手也就不离这把小茶壶了。结果离工人越来越远，这样下去多么危险啊！想到这里，张正君心情激动，决心彻底改变旧作风，老老实实接受工人的再教育。从此，上班的时候再也看不到他的小茶壶了。
