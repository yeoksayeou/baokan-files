Indian government employees continue their struggle, angrily protesting the Indian reactionary authorities' use of counter-revolutionary violence to suppress their September 19th general strike and their subsequent mad persecution of employees.

In the capital New Delhi, about 10,000 central government employees held a demonstration in front of the residence of Home Minister Chavan on the 16th to protest the reactionary government's atrocities. On the evening of the 17th, another 20,000 government employees gathered near the residence of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to hold a protest rally. The Indian reactionary government hastily dispatched a large number of armed police to tightly guard Indira Gandhi's residence, preventing government employees from approaching. The crowd participating in the protest rally persisted in their struggle and sent representatives to personally protest to Indira Gandhi. The representatives pointed out that the Indian reactionary government's so-called "disciplinary action" against employees who participated in the September 19th general strike, including dismissals and suspensions, was entirely unjustified. They demanded that the reactionary government immediately revoke these arbitrary and unreasonable punishments.

On September 19th, four million government employees across India (including railway and postal workers) held a general strike to protest the reactionary government's discrimination and cruel exploitation. The Indian reactionary government deployed armed police, carrying out horrifying violent suppression against them. Reactionary police opened fire on the striking crowd, attacking them with iron-clad batons and tear gas. As a result, ten people were killed, countless were injured, and ten thousand were arrested. Afterwards, the Indian reactionary authorities continued to dismiss and persecute employees who had participated in the strike, with as many as ten thousand in the postal department alone being suspended.

However, the brutal suppression did not intimidate the broad masses. They continued to adopt various means to resist the Indian reactionary government. By the end of September and in mid-October, postal workers across India launched two "slowdown" movements, causing postal services in many regions to come to a standstill.

    印度政府雇员坚持反暴政斗争
    二万名政府雇员在英迪拉·甘地住宅附近集会抗议反动政府的暴行
    新华社十八日讯　新德里消息：印度全国各地政府雇员继续进行斗争，愤怒抗议印度反动当局在九月十九日使用反革命暴力镇压他们的大罢工，并且在事后疯狂迫害雇员的暴行。
    在首都新德里，大约一万名中央政府雇员十六日在内政部长恰范的官府门前举行示威，抗议反动政府的暴行。十七日晚间，又有两万名政府雇员到总理英迪拉·甘地的住宅附近举行抗议集会。印度反动政府慌忙出动大批武装警察严密把守英迪拉·甘地的住宅，不让政府雇员靠近。参加抗议集会的群众坚持斗争，并且派代表当面向英迪拉·甘地提出强烈抗议。代表们指出，印度反动政府对参加过九月十九日大罢工的雇员实行所谓“纪律制裁”，给予他们开除、停职等处分，是毫无道理的，要求反动政府立即撤销这些蛮横无理的处分。
    九月十九日，印度全国四百万政府雇员（包括铁路、邮电部门的职工）曾经举行大罢工，抗议反动政府对他们的歧视和残酷剥削。印度反动政府出动武装警察，向他们实行骇人听闻的暴力镇压。反动警察开枪射击罢工群众，用包铁皮的警棍、催泪弹袭击他们，结果死者十人，受伤的无数，被捕的一万人。事后，印度反动当局继续开除和迫害参加过罢工的雇员，仅仅在邮电部门就有一万人被停职。
    但是残暴的镇压吓不倒广大群众。他们继续采取各种方式，反抗印度反动政府。在九月底和十月中，印度全国各地邮电部门的职工，两次发动“放慢工作”的运动，使许多地区的邮电业务陷于停顿。
