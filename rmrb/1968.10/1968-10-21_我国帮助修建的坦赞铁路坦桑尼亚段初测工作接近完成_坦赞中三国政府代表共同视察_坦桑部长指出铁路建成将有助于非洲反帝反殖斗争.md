Government representatives of Tanzania, Zambia, and China jointly inspected the initial survey work of the Tanzanian section of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, which is being aided by China. The Tanzanian minister pointed out that the completion of the railway will aid in Africa's anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle.

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY DAR ES SALAAM, October 19 - Over the past three days, government representatives from Tanzania, Zambia, and China have inspected the initial survey work of the Tanzanian section of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, which is being aided by China. This section of the railway is approximately 708 kilometers long, with survey work beginning in May of this year and now nearing completion.

During the inspection, Tanzania's Minister of Transport, Labor, and Works, Lusinde, Zambia's High Commissioner to Tanzania, Phiri, and China's Charge d'Affaires to Tanzania, Zhou Boqing, highly praised the preliminary survey work of the 200-kilometer section from the starting point of Kidatu to Mlimba, which was completed ahead of schedule. The preliminary survey work for the remaining sections of the Tanzanian route has also been completed by 80%.

When the three countries' government representatives, accompanied by Jin Hui, the head of the Chinese Railway Survey and Design Team, and Joseph Peta, the deputy executive officer of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority, arrived at a small village near the residence of Chinese engineering and technical personnel, they were warmly welcomed by Chinese personnel, Tanzanian workers, and local residents.

They showed great interest in the planned route of the railway and listened to a report on how Chinese engineering and technical personnel, with the close cooperation and support of Tanzanian workers, overcame difficulties and successfully completed the survey work.

Lusinde, Phiri, and Zhou Boqing visited the road construction work in the Mlimba mountainous area and inspected the geological drilling team working on the Kihansi River. There, Chinese technicians and Tanzanian workers worked side by side happily.

Lusinde spoke to the Tanzanian villagers and Chinese personnel who had gathered to welcome them, praising the friendship between the people of Tanzania and China. He expressed gratitude on behalf of the Tanzanian government and people to Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese government, and people for their genuine friendship with the Tanzanian people. He said, "China's aid helps the Tanzanian people achieve self-reliance."

He pointed out that the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway not only promotes the economic development of Tanzania and Zambia but also aids in the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the African people. He said, "The Tanzanian people are determined to liberate the entire continent of Africa. The construction of this railway will aid in the complete liberation of Africa. For this reason, it has incurred the hatred and sabotage of imperialism and colonialism."

He said he was very pleased to see the self-sacrificing spirit and high work enthusiasm of the Chinese personnel, as well as the brotherly relationship between the Chinese personnel and Tanzanian workers.

Zambia's High Commissioner, Phiri, told the welcoming crowd, "This Tanzania Railway project is indeed very close to the hearts of the Zambian people." He refuted the imperialist's rumor that Zambia did not want to undertake this project, saying, "This is sheer stupidity and completely untrue." He went on to say, "Imperialists do not want us to succeed together because the completion of this project will mean the failure of their schemes."

Phiri believed that this project is "a source of pride for all African people," and he said that the completion of this project will strengthen the friendly relations between the three countries.

Zhou Boqing also spoke, expressing gratitude to President Nyerere and President Kaunda, as well as the governments and people of Tanzania and Zambia, for their warm concern and assistance to the Chinese survey and design team. He pointed out, "The friendship between China, Tanzania, and Zambia was forged in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Despite the sabotage of imperialism, the people of the three countries have the confidence and determination to achieve great success in the construction of this railway."

    我国帮助修建的坦赞铁路坦桑尼亚段初测工作接近完成
    坦赞中三国政府代表共同视察
    坦桑部长指出铁路建成将有助于非洲反帝反殖斗争
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆十九日电　坦桑尼亚、赞比亚和中国政府的代表，在过去三天中，视察了由中国帮助修建的坦桑尼亚—赞比亚铁路坦桑尼亚段的初步勘测工作。这段铁路长约七百零八公里，从今年五月份开始勘测，目前已经接近完成。
    在视察时，坦桑尼亚交通、劳工和工程部长卢辛德、赞比亚驻坦桑尼亚高级专员菲里、中国驻坦桑尼亚大使馆临时代办周伯萍，高度评价了已经提前完成的从这段铁路起点基达图到姆林巴的二百公里线路的初步勘测工作。坦桑尼亚路段的其余线路的初步勘测工作，也已经完成了百分之八十。
    当三国政府的代表在中国铁路勘测和设计小组组长靳辉、坦赞铁路当局联合机构副执行官乔佩塔的陪同下，来到一个小村子附近的中国工程技术人员驻地时，受到了中国人员、坦桑尼亚工人和当地居民的热烈欢迎。
    他们以极大的兴趣观看了这段铁路的计划，并听取了关于中国工程技术人员如何在坦桑尼亚工人的密切合作和支援下克服困难、胜利完成勘测工作的报告。
    卢辛德、菲里和周伯萍参观了姆林巴山区的筑路工作，视察了在基汉吉河上工作的地质钻孔队。在那里，中国技术人员和坦桑尼亚工人愉快地并肩劳动着。
    卢辛德部长向聚拢来欢迎他们的坦桑尼亚村民和中国人员讲话，盛赞坦中两国人民的友谊。他代表坦桑尼亚政府和人民表示感激毛泽东主席、中国政府和人民对坦桑尼亚人民的真正友谊。他说：“中国的援助帮助坦桑尼亚人民实现他们的自力更生。”
    他指出，坦赞铁路的修建不仅会促进坦桑尼亚和赞比亚经济的发展，而且帮助非洲人民反帝反殖的斗争。他说：“坦桑尼亚人民决心要使整个非洲得到解放。这条铁路的修建将有助于非洲的完全解放。正因为如此，它招致帝国主义和殖民主义的仇视和破坏。”
    他说，他很高兴地看到，中国人员所表现的自我牺牲精神和高度的工作热情以及中国人员和坦桑尼亚工人之间的兄弟般的关系。
    赞比亚高级专员菲里对欢迎的群众说：“这项坦桑铁路工程对于赞比亚人民的确是很亲切的。”他驳斥了帝国主义的所谓赞比亚不愿搞这个工程的谣言，他说：“这是彻头彻尾的愚蠢，一点不真实。”他接着说：“帝国主义者不愿意我们胜利在一起，因为这个工程的建成将意味着他们的诡计的破产。”
    菲里认为这项工程是“全体非洲人民的骄傲”，他还说，这项工程的建成将加强三国的友好关系。
    周伯萍也发表讲话，感谢尼雷尔总统和卡翁达总统以及坦赞两国政府和人民对中国勘探设计小组工作的亲切关怀和体贴帮助。他指出：“中国、坦桑尼亚和赞比亚之间的友谊是在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争中结成的。尽管帝国主义进行破坏，三国人民有信心和决心使这条铁路的兴建取得巨大的成功。”（附图片）
