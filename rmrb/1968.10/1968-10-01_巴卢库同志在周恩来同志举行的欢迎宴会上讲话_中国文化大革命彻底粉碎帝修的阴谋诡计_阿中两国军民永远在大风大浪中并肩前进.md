Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear Comrade Kang Sheng, dear comrades and friends:

Please allow us to express our heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the government of the Albanian People's Republic for the warm and friendly welcome we have received in your great country. We are still deeply moved by the passionate and fervent sentiments expressed by the revolutionary masses of Shanghai and your glorious capital, Beijing.

Comrade Zhou Enlai's heartfelt and brotherly remarks at this extremely warm banquet about our party, our people, and our country have powerfully expressed the pure and sincere fraternal feelings, solid friendship, and deep affection of the brotherly Chinese people for the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and our great leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Dear comrades, we assure you that the entire Albanian people harbor the same pure, sincere, fraternal, and internationalist feelings towards the great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and its great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, the most esteemed friend of the Albanian people and an outstanding Marxist-Leninist.

With hearts full of love, we have visited your great and powerful country. We bring the most ardent revolutionary greetings from the Albanian people, the Labor Party, the government of the Albanian People's Republic, and our people's and party's leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the brotherly Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, the great and respected leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the government of the People's Republic of China.

On the eve of the glorious anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are particularly happy and honored to be living among our closest comrades-in-arms in fraternal socialist China. The victory of the Chinese revolution on October 1, 1949, was, after the victory of the October Revolution, the most significant event in world history, marking a new stage in human history and bringing about a change in the international balance of power in favor of revolution and socialism.

We are visiting your glorious country at a time when the red flag of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is proudly flying over the entire People's Republic of China. This great revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, has entered its final stage. It has not only great historical and class significance for the brotherly Chinese people but also for all revolutionary peoples and Marxist-Leninist forces worldwide. This profound ideological and political revolution has finally consigned the traitors and enemies of the Chinese people, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, to the dustbin of history, delivering a fatal blow to the international spy network of imperialism and revisionism aimed at restoring capitalism and promoting revisionism in the People's Republic of China. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's great Marxist-Leninist thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has thoroughly smashed the plots and tricks of imperialism and revisionism, ensuring that the great people's China—Mao Zedong's China—remains forever red and an unshakable fortress of the great cause of revolution and socialism.

The Albanian people, like all progressive humanity, are filled with immense joy and passion at the historic victory of the great people's China, which has established revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except for Taiwan, which is temporarily occupied by U.S. imperialism. Today, throughout the entire People's Republic of China, there is a wonderful and unprecedented revolutionary atmosphere. New and more glorious prospects lie before the brotherly Chinese people. The Chinese people are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, mobilizing with redoubled energy to excellently and accurately complete all important tasks of revolution and production, and consolidating the great socialist achievements they have already won. The Chinese people, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions on enhancing the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in education and all aspects of life, and the tasks he has set forth in the new stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, are pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution towards complete victory.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's thought have now become the victorious banner and great historical lesson for all revolutionary and progressive forces in the world. They are an inspiring example for all revolutionary peoples and healthy communist forces in socialist countries who are struggling for freedom and independence. These healthy communist forces and the working class in these socialist countries can only achieve a thorough victory by waging a resolute class struggle to overthrow the groups that have usurped the leadership of the party and the state, and by establishing proletarian dictatorship through armed revolution in their own countries.

The Albanian people regard the historic victories of the brotherly Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction as their own victories, as decisive victories for further strengthening your glorious country. Your country stands like a rock at the forefront of the struggle of the revolutionary peoples of all countries against U.S.-led world imperialism and reaction, and against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet traitor clique. Today, the peoples of the world see the great people's China as a reliable rear base for revolution, a steadfast defender of their freedom and independence, and a fiery standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism.

Dear comrades,

The international situation is excellent for the revolutionary and progressive forces of the world. The imperialists led by U.S. imperialism and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet traitor clique are mired in deep internal and external contradictions, having a hard time, and suffering one defeat after another. The plots and backstage activities of imperialism and revisionism to seize world hegemony are being and will continue to be increasingly exposed. Under the invincible guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong's thought, the great Chinese people are strongly rising up against these counter-revolutionary activities, steadfastly marching at the forefront of all freedom-loving peoples, and advancing on the road to the victory of Marxism-Leninism and world revolution. Today, the People's Republic of China has become a powerful socialist country with modern industry, advanced socialist agriculture, proletarian education and culture, highly developed science and technology, and a strong, indestructible national defense force. The glorious 700 million Chinese people, first and foremost armed with the spiritual atomic bomb of Comrade Mao Zedong's great Marxist-Leninist thought, also possess atomic and hydrogen weapons. Thus, they have all the necessary means to thoroughly smash any aggressive plots that the U.S. imperialists or the modern revisionists of the Khrushchev type might dare to hatch against the People's Republic of China. The atomic weapons possessed by the glorious Chinese people not only break and shatter the monopoly of imperialism and revisionism, making China a nuclear power, but are also a reliable guarantee for the great cause of revolutionary and socialist victory and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world. Today, the great people's China has become an invincible giant with high international prestige. No major international political issue can be resolved or decided without China's voice.

In the contemporary world, the revolutionary peoples of various countries are advancing in victory, and the revolution is continuously developing and improving in quality. Imperialists and modern revisionists are encountering deep crises, continuous defeats, and setbacks on their own path. They are trying every means to strengthen the "holy alliance" of imperialism and revisionism to realize their strategy of ruling and enslaving the peoples of the world. In Asia, Latin America, Africa, and everywhere, peoples are rising up to fight for freedom and independence, dealing fatal blows to imperialists and revisionists. The heroic war of the Vietnamese people clearly demonstrates this. This is a vivid example for the peoples of various countries who love freedom and are fighting and defeating imperialism and its lackeys. However, the Soviet revisionists are also trying in every way to make the war of the Vietnamese people serve their "global strategy" of dividing the world's spheres of influence. They are striving through "negotiations" to make Vietnam surrender, thus saving the war chariot of U.S. imperialism from the mire. However, the experience of revolution and people's war itself clearly shows that the Vietnamese problem cannot be solved through negotiations and deals but only on the battlefield, through armed struggle, until the final defeat of the U.S. occupiers.

The Soviet revisionist clique betrayed Marxism-Leninism and international communism and the workers' movement at the infamous 20th Congress in the style of Khrushchev. This clique continues to pursue a policy of collusion with U.S. imperialism, dividing spheres of influence, and implementing a "global strategy" to dominate the world. Due to ideological and political degeneration, the Soviet revisionist clique has turned the Soviet Union into a counter-revolutionary center and a fascist aggressor country. Serving this traitorous policy and the plundering schemes of imperialism and revisionism are the infamous Warsaw Pact, which has completely become a dirty, counter-revolutionary, anti-people, and anti-democratic tool, now used against its member countries.

Due to the surrender and capitulation of the Dubcek and Svoboda clique, Soviet aggressive forces and their lackeys have occupied Czechoslovakia. This clearly reveals the ugly, aggressive, and hostile nature of this pact, exposing the deep antagonistic contradictions and divisions within the modern revisionists. For this reason, the People's Assembly of the Albanian People's Republic has publicly and legally declared the abolition of this aggressive pact, which has the same nature and purpose as the North Atlantic Aggression Pact. The new tsars of the Kremlin, using the policy of great powers, are carrying out brutal, fascist repression and interference, turning these countries into bases for aggression. East Germany has become a pawn in the transactions and betrayals of the Soviet revisionists with U.S. imperialism and the revanchists of Bonn, harming the people of the German Democratic Republic.

The Bulgarian revisionist leadership completely submits to the will of Moscow, turning their country into a dangerous bridgehead for the aggressive plans of Soviet revisionist forces against the peoples and countries of the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The government of the Albanian People's Republic has always steadfastly defended peace and maintained socialism, firmly demanding that the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria immediately withdraw these aggressive forces from Bulgarian territory.

Under these conditions of political difficulty and deadlock for the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its satellite countries, they are desperately trying to stage a farce and exert pressure to revive the "Budapest carnival," at least to hobble to the Moscow conference with a broken cane. But even this farce will inevitably suffer a shameful failure. What awaits modern revisionism is only complete and irrevocable failure.

Dear comrades,

The Albanian people and the great Chinese people have forged an unbreakable and eternal friendship on the invincible principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Our great, steel-like friendship has been tempered in the revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

This is an unbreakable people's friendship that has shown its strength and vitality in good times and difficult years, a friendship that has withstood severe tests. This is the test that our two peoples, two parties, and two countries have already experienced and will continue to experience in the resolute, principled, and unwavering struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.

China and Albania, the Communist Party of China and the Albanian Labor Party, are resolutely and principled in their struggle against imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism, firmly defending the principles of Marxism-Leninism, continuously carrying out the socialist revolution, and strongly supporting the revolutionary movements and national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Thus, we have fulfilled our internationalist duties to the international communist and workers' movements. Our two peoples and our two peoples' armies, as close comrades-in-arms in the common cause of socialism and revolution, will continue to march side by side in the construction and defense of socialism and communism, and will forever forge ahead in the great storms to seize the final victory of the revolution.

U.S. imperialists and Soviet Khrushchev revisionists regard this true friendship of the revolutionary peoples as a thorn in their eye. They are using all their might to weaken and destroy this friendship. But the result is the opposite and will always be the opposite: no force in the world can destroy our great and eternal friendship in the slightest. In the telegram of September 17, 1968, from the great leader, outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai to Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu, this point is especially emphasized. The telegram states: "The great proletarian fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, forged in the revolutionary storm, is tempered and unbreakable. The 700 million Chinese people, tempered even stronger in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will stand firmly by the side of the brotherly Albanian people at all times and under all circumstances. If U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will face only complete, shameful, and irrevocable failure."

The historic telegram from our greatest friend, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the other leaders of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government, like a lightning bolt, reached the remotest corners of our country. The entire Albanian people, workers, peasants, old and young, welcomed this brilliant telegram with indescribable joy and enthusiasm. This telegram has increased the strength and determination of our people to smash and defeat the aggression of imperialism and revisionism. On behalf of the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the government of the Albanian People's Republic, we express our most sincere thanks and deepest gratitude to the brotherly Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and the government of the People's Republic of China for this sublime internationalist sentiment and resolute revolutionary support for the Albanian people.

Dear comrades and friends,

The Albanian people believe that no matter what difficulties we encounter, no matter what happens, our two brotherly peoples, our two parties, and our two countries will always maintain close friendship and steel-like unity, forever marching forward, forever united, fighting together, and victorious together on the glorious path of socialism and revolution. The unbreakable fighting friendship between Albania and China, as Comrade Enver Hoxha said, is "a friendship of revolutionaries, a friendship between comrades-in-arms fighting for the sacred ideals of socialism and communism. Therefore, this friendship is eternal, evergreen, flourishing, and invincible."

Dear comrades and friends,

The Albanian people are united as one under the leadership of the Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, fully mobilized to implement the historic resolutions of the Fifth Party Congress and the magnificent program for further revolutionizing our country's life. Great revolutionary enthusiasm, unprecedented labor fervor, revolutionary initiative, high alertness and vigilance for defending our country and the victories of our socialist revolution, and unceasing struggle to eradicate all old remnants have taken hold of the hearts of all our broad masses. Relying on the creative labor and revolutionary enthusiasm of our working people and the extremely precious internationalist aid of our brotherly Chinese people, whom we are very grateful to, the fourth five-year plan (1966-1970) will further advance our country on the road to building socialism. Our people are determined and prepared to defeat any aggression from any quarter, be it imperialist or revisionist, in the fires of people's war. With a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, we are working and maintaining vigilance. The Albanian People's Republic will forever be an indestructible socialist fortress standing on the Adriatic coast, where the flags of Marxism-Leninism and revolution will forever fly proudly.

Finally, please allow me to raise a toast:

To the great, fighting, revolutionary, and eternal friendship between the Albanian people and the brotherly Chinese people,
To the glorious Communist Party of China, the organizer and leader of the Chinese people's victory,
To the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, the great leader beloved by the Chinese people, and the most esteemed friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong, for his health,
To the health of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Comrade Mao Zedong's closest comrade-in-arms,
To the health of Premier Zhou Enlai,
To the health of Comrade Kang Sheng,
To the health of the comrades of the Central Cultural Revolution Group,
To the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China,
To the health of all attendees at this reception,
To the glory of Marxism-Leninism,
Cheers!

    巴卢库同志在周恩来同志举行的欢迎宴会上讲话
    中国文化大革命彻底粉碎帝修的阴谋诡计
    阿中两国军民永远在大风大浪中并肩前进
    新华社三十日讯　阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团团长、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库同志二十九日在周恩来同志欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团宴会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的康生同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    请允许我们代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，对在你们伟大的国家所给予我们代表团的十分亲切、友好的欢迎，表示最衷心的兄弟般的感谢。现在，我们还激动地沉浸在上海和你们光荣的首都北京的革命劳动群众所强烈表达的激情和火热的感情之中。
    周恩来同志在这个极为亲切的宴会上对我们党、我国人民和我们国家所说的热情的、充满了兄弟友爱的一番话，有力地表达了兄弟的中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和我们伟大的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的纯洁的真挚的兄弟感情，牢固的友谊和深深的热爱。
    亲爱的同志们，我们向你们保证：全体阿尔巴尼亚人民对伟大的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党及其伟大的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民最尊贵的朋友、杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志，怀着同样纯洁的、真挚的、兄弟般的、国际主义的感情。
    我们怀着热爱的心情，访问你们伟大、强盛的祖国，我们给兄弟的中国人民，光荣的中国共产党，伟大的、敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志，中央文革和中华人民共和国政府带来了阿尔巴尼亚人民、劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和我们人民与党的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志本人的最热烈的革命问候。
    在中国人民的光荣节日——中华人民共和国成立十九周年的前夕，我们生活在兄弟的社会主义中国，生活在我们最亲密的战友当中，我们为此感到特别的高兴和很大的荣幸。一九四九年十月一日，中国革命的胜利是继十月革命胜利之后，最富有世界历史意义的事件，因为它标志着人类历史上的一个新阶段，使国际力量对比发生了有利于革命和社会主义的变化。
    正当无产阶级文化大革命的红旗在中华人民共和国全国骄傲地飘扬的时候，我们访问你们光荣的祖国。这场由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的伟大的革命已经进入了它的最后阶段。这不仅对兄弟的中国人民，而且对所有革命人民和世界马克思列宁主义力量，都具有伟大的历史的和阶级的意义。这场具有深刻的思想性和政治性的革命，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的中国人民的一小撮叛徒和敌人最终扔进了垃圾堆，给了旨在中华人民共和国复辟资本主义和推行修正主义的帝修国际阴谋间谍网一个致命的打击。在毛泽东同志的伟大的马克思列宁主义思想照耀下的无产阶级文化大革命彻底粉碎了帝修的阴谋诡计，使伟大的人民中国——毛泽东的中国永远保持鲜红的颜色，永远是革命和社会主义伟大事业的坚如磐石的不可摧毁的堡垒。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民同全体进步人类一样，对于伟大的中国人民所取得的除了暂时还被美帝国主义占领的台湾以外的伟大的人民中国的各省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会的历史性胜利，心中充满了无比的高兴和激情。现在在整个中华人民共和国，充满了一片大好的、空前的革命气氛。新的、更加光辉的远景已经展现在兄弟的中国人民面前。中国人民坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命思想，已经动员起来，以百倍的精力去很好地、准确地完成革命和生产的各项重要任务，胜利地巩固中国人民已经取得的伟大的社会主义胜利成果。中国人民遵照毛主席关于提高工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中、在教育和生活各个领域内的无产阶级革命中的领导作用的最新指示及其在斗、批、改新阶段中提出的各项任务，正在把无产阶级文化大革命推向彻底的胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命和毛主席思想，现在已经成了世界上一切革命力量和进步力量的胜利旗帜和伟大的历史性教导，是起来争取自由和独立的一切革命人民和社会主义国家中一切健康的共产主义力量及工人阶级的令人鼓舞的活榜样；这些社会主义国家的健康的共产主义力量和工人阶级只有进行坚决的阶级斗争，才能彻底推翻各个篡夺了党和国家领导的集团，从而通过武装革命，在自己的国家里建立无产阶级专政。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民把兄弟的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设中的历史性胜利，看作是自己的胜利，看作是进一步加强你们光荣的祖国的决定性胜利。你们祖国象山岩一样屹立在各国革命人民反对以美国为首的世界帝国主义和世界反动派、反对以苏联叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义斗争的前列。今天，世界人民把伟大的人民中国看成是革命的可靠后盾，看成是自己自由和独立的坚定的捍卫者，看成是马克思列宁主义的炽烈的旗手。
    亲爱的同志们，
    国际形势对世界的革命力量和进步力量来说是一片大好。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者和以苏联叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者陷入深刻的内外矛盾之中，日子很难过，遭到一个又一个的失败。帝修的阴谋和获取世界霸权的幕后活动，已经并正在日益被揭露。在毛泽东主席的战无不胜的思想指引下的伟大的中国人民，有力地起来反对这些反革命活动，坚定不移地走在所有爱好自由的人民的前列，在马克思列宁主义和全世界革命的胜利的道路上前进。今天，中华人民共和国已成为一个强大的社会主义国家，它具有现代化的工业、先进的社会主义农业、无产阶级的教育和文化、高度的世界水平的科学技术和强大的、坚不可摧的国防力量。首先用毛泽东同志的伟大的马克思列宁主义思想这个精神原子武器武装起来的光荣的七亿中国人民，同时也拥有原子武器和氢武器，这样就具备了为彻底粉碎美帝国主义者或赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者胆敢对中华人民共和国策划任何侵略阴谋所必需的一切东西。光荣的中国人民所拥有的原子武器不仅打破和粉碎了帝修的垄断，使中国成为一个核大国，而且也是争取革命和社会主义胜利的伟大事业以及捍卫亚洲和世界和平的可靠保证。今天，伟大的人民中国已成为具有崇高的国际威望的不可战胜的巨人。没有中国的发言，任何重大的国际政治问题都不可能获得解决和作出决定。
    在当代，各国革命人民正在胜利迈进，革命正在不断向前发展，并且质量不断提高。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者，在自己道路上，正在接连遭到深刻的危机、不断的溃败和失利，他们千方百计地加强帝修的“神圣同盟”，以实现其统治和奴役世界人民的“全球战略”。在亚洲、拉丁美洲、非洲和一切地方，人民起来争取自由和独立，正在给帝国主义者和修正主义者以致命的打击。越南人民的英勇战争也清楚地证明了这点。这是对热爱自由、同帝国主义及其仆从进行斗争并战胜他们的各国人民的生动范例。但是，苏联修正主义者也在想方设法力图使越南人民的战争服从于他们划分世界势力范围的“全球战略”，他们竭力通过“会谈”来使越南屈服，从而使美帝国主义的战车从泥潭中得救出来。但是，革命者和人民战争的经验本身清楚地表明：越南问题决不是通过会谈和交易所能解决的，只有在战场上，通过武装斗争直到最后战胜美国占领者才能解决。
    苏联修正主义集团在赫鲁晓夫式的臭名昭著的二十次代表大会上，背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了国际共产主义和工人运动。这个集团继续推行同美帝相勾结的政策，划分势力范围，实行“全球战略”的策略，主宰世界。由于思想上、政治上的蜕化变质，苏联修正主义集团把苏联变成了一个反革命中心，变成了一个法西斯式的侵略国。为这一叛徒政策、为帝修掠夺阴谋效劳的，还有臭名远扬的华沙条约，这个条约已经完全成为一个肮脏的、反革命的、反人民的和反民主的工具，现在又用来反对其成员国。
    由于杜布切克、斯沃博达集团的投降和屈服，苏联侵略势力及其仆从侵占了捷克斯洛伐克。这就清楚地表明了这一条约的丑恶面貌，侵略性和敌对性，它暴露了目前现代修正主义者内部深刻的对抗性的矛盾和分歧。正因为这一切，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会从法律上公开地宣布废除这个侵略性的、同北大西洋侵略条约具有同样性质和目的的条约。克里姆林宫的新沙皇们，应用大国政策，进行粗暴的、法西斯的镇压和干涉，把这些国家变成了侵略的策源地。东德现已成为苏联修正主义者同美帝国主义者和波恩复仇主义者进行危害德意志民主共和国人民的交易和叛卖勾当的玩物。
    保加利亚修正主义领导集团完全屈从于莫斯科的旨意，把自己的国家变成了苏联侵略势力对别国人民和别的国家、特别是对巴尔干和东欧的人民和国家推行奴役计划的危险的桥头堡。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府始终不渝地保卫和平和维护社会主义，坚决要求保加利亚人民共和国政府使这些侵略军立即从保加利亚领土上撤走。
    在这种对苏修叛徒集团及其卫星国政治上困难的、走投无路的条件和形势下，他们竭力玩弄骗局和施加压力，以复活“布达佩斯狂欢节”，至少也要拄着破拐杖去参加莫斯科会议。但是，即使这一场丑剧也必将遭到可耻的失败。等待着现代修正主义的只有彻底的、无可挽回的失败。
    亲爱的同志们，
    阿尔巴尼亚人民同伟大的中国人民在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义战无不胜的原则上，结成了牢不可破的永恒友谊。我们伟大的、钢铁般的友谊，是在以伟大领袖毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党和以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在革命斗争的烈火中锤炼出来的。
    这是一种牢不可破的人民的友谊，它在美好的日子里和困难的岁月里都显示了自己的力量和生命力，是经受过严重的考验的，这就是我们两国人民、两党和两国已经和将要在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的坚决的、原则性的和始终不渝的斗争中所经受的考验。
    中国和阿尔巴尼亚，中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，坚决地和原则性地进行反对帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争，坚决捍卫马克思列宁主义的原则，不断地进行社会主义革命，大力支持亚、非、拉人民的革命运动和民族解放运动，从而履行了自己对国际共产主义运动和工人运动的国际主义义务。我们两国人民和两国人民军队，作为共同的社会主义事业和革命事业的亲密无间的同志和战友，将一如既往，永远在建设和保卫社会主义和共产主义的事业中并肩前进，将永远在大风大浪中勇往直前夺取革命的最后胜利。
    美帝国主义者和苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，把革命人民的这种真正的友谊视为眼中钉。他们千方百计地以全部力量来削弱和破坏这种友谊。但结果是相反，并将永远是相反：世界上没有任何力量能够丝毫地破坏我们伟大的永恒的友谊。在伟大的领袖、杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志、林彪副主席同志以及周恩来同志一九六八年九月十七日给霍查同志和谢胡同志的电报中特别强调了这点。电报中说：“中阿两国人民在革命的暴风雨中建立起来的伟大的无产阶级的战斗友谊，是经受得住严峻考验的。在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民，在任何时候、任何情况下，都将始终如一地站在兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民最伟大的朋友——毛泽东同志以及中国人民、中国共产党和中国政府的其他领导人的这份具有历史意义的电报，象闪电一样传到我们祖国最边远的角落。全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，工人、农民，大人和小孩怀着无法描绘的喜悦和热情欢迎这个光辉的电报。这个电报增强了我国人民粉碎和战胜帝国主义和修正主义的侵略的力量和决心。我们代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，向兄弟的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志以及中华人民共和国政府表示我们最真诚的谢意和最深切的感激，感谢他们这种崇高的国际主义情谊和对阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决的革命的支援。
    亲爱的同志们：阿尔巴尼亚人民相信，不管遇到什么困难，不管发生什么情况，我们两国兄弟人民、两党和两国将始终保持亲密的友谊和钢铁般的团结，永远向前迈进，将在光荣的社会主义和革命的道路上，永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。阿中两国牢不可破的战斗友谊，正如恩维尔·霍查同志所说的，是“革命者的友谊，为争取社会主义、共产主义神圣理想胜利的战友之间的友谊，因此这种友谊是永恒的、万古长青的、繁荣昌盛的和无往不胜的”。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，
    阿尔巴尼亚人民万众一心地团结在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的周围，为了胜利地贯彻党的第五次代表大会的历史性决议和我国生活的进一步革命化的宏伟纲领，已全力动员起来了。巨大的革命干劲，空前的劳动热情，革命的首创精神，为保卫祖国和我国社会主义革命的胜利成果的高度战备观念和警惕性，为根除各种旧残余的不断斗争，占据了我国全体广大劳动群众的心灵，依靠我国劳动群众的创造性劳动和革命干劲以及我们非常感激的兄弟般的中国人民极为珍贵的国际主义援助，一九六六——一九七○年的第四个五年计划，将把我国在建成社会主义的道路上进一步推向前进。我国人民决心并准备着在人民战争的战火中，击败来自任何方面的侵略，不管是帝国主义方面的，还是修正主义方面的，我国人民一手拿镐，一手拿枪，进行着劳动和保持着警惕。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国将永远是屹立在亚得里亚海岸的社会主义不可摧毁的堡垒。在那里，马克思列宁主义和革命的旗帜将永远骄傲地飘扬着。
    最后，请允许我举杯：
    为阿尔巴尼亚人民同兄弟的中国人民之间的伟大的、战斗的、革命的、永恒的友谊，
    为中国人民胜利的组织者和领导者光荣的中国共产党，
    为杰出的马克思列宁主义者，中国人民敬爱的伟大领袖，阿尔巴尼亚人民最尊贵的朋友毛泽东同志的健康，
    为毛泽东同志最亲密的战友林彪副主席的健康，
    为国务院总理周恩来同志的健康，
    为康生同志的健康，
    为中央文革同志们的健康，
    为中国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，
    为这次招待会的所有出席者的健康，
    为马克思列宁主义的光荣，
    干杯！
