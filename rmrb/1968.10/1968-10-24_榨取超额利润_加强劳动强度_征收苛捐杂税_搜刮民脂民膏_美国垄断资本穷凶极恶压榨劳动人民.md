As the political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism deepen, the American monopoly bourgeoisie, while stepping up their aggressive expansion abroad and more brutally exploiting the people of colonies and dependent countries, are increasingly ruthlessly exploiting the American working class and the broad masses of working people at home, in an attempt to prolong their reactionary rule.

In recent years, in addition to tightening fascist rule and brutally suppressing the people politically, the American monopoly bourgeoisie have intensified their exploitation of the broad masses of workers and other working people. One of their important means of exploiting workers is to ruthlessly exploit them and squeeze out excessive profits. It is reported that the excessive profits squeezed out by the American monopoly bourgeoisie in recent years have increased sharply. In the fourth quarter of last year, the pure profits squeezed out by the various companies of the American monopoly bourgeoisie amounted to nearly 12.8 billion dollars, nearly double that of the same period in 1961.

Capitalists disregard human life, work injuries increase

In pursuit of profits, the greedy American monopoly capitalists use every possible means to force workers to increase their labor intensity, compel workers to work overtime, extend working hours, and ruthlessly exploit workers' surplus labor. It is reported that in 1966, about 3.8 million workers in the United States were forced to work more than 10 hours a day. Taking General Motors Corporation as an example, since 1960, this company has used the above methods to squeeze out profits of 8,000 to 10,000 dollars from each worker. Due to the increase in labor intensity and working hours, the health of American workers has deteriorated rapidly, and work injuries have increased sharply. From 1960 to 1966, 98,000 American workers died due to the capitalists' disregard for human life, and 14.25 million were injured.

While directly suffering from the brutal exploitation of the capitalists, American workers are also plundered by the American monopoly bourgeoisie's representative, the U.S. reactionary government. The U.S. reactionary government issues paper money indiscriminately, causing inflation; it invents various pretexts to levy various oppressive taxes, making the lives of American workers and the broad masses of people even more difficult.

Taxes and debts drain the workers' blood

At the same time, the various levels of government in the United States levy heavier and more numerous taxes on American workers and the broad masses of people. For example, the so-called property tax levied on the broad masses of people increased by 35% from 1963 to 1967 over five years; the so-called income tax and consumption tax are not only collected by the U.S. federal government, but also by the authorities of various states, cities, and counties. In short, everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation is taxed. Some local authorities even ordered that beggars must pay a begging tax. It is estimated that this year the U.S. government will squeeze out 250 billion dollars from American workers and the broad masses of people through various pretexts, nearly double that of ten years ago. After being brutally exploited by the monopoly capitalists, the meager wages that American workers take home have one-third of it paid in taxes. Recently, the Johnson administration further cut into the American people, deciding to impose an additional 10% income tax surcharge.

Under the brutal exploitation and oppression of the American monopoly bourgeoisie, many American workers have to rely on borrowing to make ends meet. Thus, they fall further into the clutches of usurers and suffer another layer of exploitation. It is estimated that the "household debt" of the American people was only 35 billion dollars in 1946, but by 1967 it had jumped to 387 billion dollars, increasing more than tenfold. In 1967, on average, 22% of each worker's annual income had to be used to repay debts. When workers are unable to repay their debts, the U.S. reactionary government orders the companies where the workers are employed to deduct from their wages, causing a large number of workers to fall into a desperate situation.

Black workers are the most heavily exploited, the most miserable

It should be particularly noted that the situation of black workers, other minority workers, female workers, and young workers in the United States is even more miserable. Black workers in the United States engage in the heaviest and dirtiest labor, but their wages are the lowest. The unemployment rate of black people is also the highest, with the unemployment rate of black youth being even higher. U.S. Senator McCarthy recently admitted that the unemployment rate of black youth is as high as 26.5%. Black people and other minority workers who work in agriculture suffer even more severe exploitation and oppression. The U.S. magazine "Time" admits that black cotton workers in Mississippi state work 12 hours a day, but their wages are only one-third of the wages of ordinary workers in the United States.

In the United States, female workers' wages are lower than those of male workers doing the same type of work, and many working women can only find half-day jobs, so their wages are even lower.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are also such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." The American monopoly bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the American working class and the broad masses of working people are further intensifying class contradictions within the United States, promoting the vigorous development of the struggle of the American people.

    榨取超额利润  加强劳动强度  征收苛捐杂税  搜刮民脂民膏
    美国垄断资本穷凶极恶压榨劳动人民
    据新华社二十一日讯　随着美帝国主义政治和经济危机的日益加深，美国垄断资产阶级在对外加紧进行扩张侵略，更加残酷地剥削殖民地和附属国人民的同时，正在国内越来越穷凶极恶地压榨美国工人阶级和广大劳动人民，妄图以此来苟延它的反动统治。
    近年来，美国垄断资产阶级除了在政治上加紧法西斯统治，疯狂镇压人民以外，还变本加厉地压榨广大工人和其他劳动人民。它压榨工人的一个重要手段，就是残酷地剥削工人，榨取超额利润。据报道，美国垄断资产阶级最近几年榨取的超额利润急剧增加。去年第四季度美国垄断资产阶级的各种公司剥削所得的纯利润差不多达到一百二十八亿美元，比一九六一年同期高出一倍。
    资本家玩忽人命，工伤事故大增
    为了追逐利润，贪得无厌的美国垄断资本家千方百计地强迫工人加强劳动强度，迫使工人加班加点，延长劳动时间，敲骨吸髓地榨取工人的剩余劳动。据报道，一九六六年美国约有三百八十万工人每天要被迫工作十小时以上。以美国通用汽车公司为例，从一九六○年以来，这家公司用上述办法，从每个工人身上榨取的利润高达八千到一万美元。由于劳动强度的增强和劳动时间的延长，美国工人的健康情况急速恶化，工伤事故大量增加。从一九六○年到一九六六年，因垄断资本家玩忽人命而死亡的美国工人达九万八千多人，负伤的多达一千四百二十五万人。
    美国工人在直接受到资本家的残酷剥削的同时，还遭受到美国垄断资产阶级的总代表美国政府的猖狂掠夺。美国反动政府滥发钞票，制造通货膨胀；巧立名目，征收各种苛捐杂税，使得美国工人和广大人民的生活更加难熬。
    纳税、欠债喝干了工人的血汗
    与此同时，美国各级政府向美国工人和广大人民征收的赋税却越来越重，名目繁多。例如对广大人民征收的所谓财产税，从一九六三年到一九六七年五年间增加了百分之三十五；所谓所得税和消费税，不仅美国联邦政府要收，各州的当局要收，市和县的当局也要收。总之，衣、食、住、行，样样都要上税。甚至有的地方当局竟下令，乞丐也须付求乞税。据统计，美国政府今年用各种名目向美国工人和广大人民群众榨取的捐税，将达二千五百亿美元，约为十年前的两倍。美国工人经过垄断资本家残酷剥削后拿回家的微薄的工资，其中三分之一缴了税。最近，约翰逊政府又进一步向美国人民开刀，决定加征百分之十的所得税附加税。
    在美国垄断资产阶级残酷剥削和压榨之下，许多美国工人不得不依靠借债度日。这样，他们又进一步落入了高利贷者的魔掌中，受到又一层盘剥。据统计，美国人民的“家庭债务”，在一九四六年只有三百五十亿美元，到一九六七年就一跃而为三千八百七十亿美元，增加了十倍以上。一九六七年，平均每个工人每年收入的百分之二十二要用来还债。当工人无法偿还债务时，美国反动政府就命令工人所在的公司从工人的工资中扣除，使大批工人陷于走投无路的困境。
    黑人工人受剥削最重，情况最惨
    特别应当指出的是，美国黑人工人、其他少数民族工人、女工和青年工人的情况更加悲惨。美国黑人工人从事最重、最脏的劳动，但工资却是最低。美国黑人的失业率也最高，其中黑人青年的失业率更高。美国参议员麦卡锡最近供认，黑人青年的失业率高达百分之二十六点五。充当农业工人的黑人和其他少数民族工人，受的剥削和压迫更是惨重。美国《时代》杂志承认，在美国密西西比州的黑人植棉工人，每天工作十二小时，而工资只有美国普通工人工资的三分之一。
    在美国，女工的工资要比从事同一工种的男工低，许多劳动妇女还只能找到半天工作，工资当然也就更低。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”美国垄断资产阶级对美国工人阶级和广大劳动人民的猖狂进攻，正在进一步加剧美国国内的阶级矛盾，促进美国人民斗争的蓬勃发展。
