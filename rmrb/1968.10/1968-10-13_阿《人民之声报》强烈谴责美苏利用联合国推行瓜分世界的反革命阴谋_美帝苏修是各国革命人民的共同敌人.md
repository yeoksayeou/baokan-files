	Albanian "People's Voice" Strongly Condemns U.S. and Soviet Use of the United Nations to Carry Out Counter-Revolutionary Conspiracy of Dividing the World
	U.S. Imperialism and Soviet Revisionism Are Common Enemies of the Revolutionary People of All Countries
	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 11

	The Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on October 10, exposing the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to use the United Nations to implement their policy of carving up spheres of influence. The editorial strongly condemned the new sinister plots of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to oppose the people of all countries.

	The article said, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism have long been trying to manipulate the United Nations, using it as a tool to implement their sinister plots against the freedom and sovereignty of the people of all countries, making the United Nations serve the hegemonic policy of the two superpowers to carve up spheres of influence and rule the world. The statements of Rusk and Gromyko at the 23rd session of the United Nations General Assembly and their frequent activities inside and outside the United Nations once again show that the two superpowers are further tightening their counter-revolutionary collusion under the pretext of "international constructive cooperation."

	The article pointed out that Rusk's statements at the United Nations once again proved that Washington was not surprised by the Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia; the invasion was actually carried out with the tacit approval of U.S. imperialism.

	The article said, from the statements of Rusk and Gromyko, it can be seen that they made efforts in their talks to reach a new Soviet-U.S. agreement on offensive and defensive missiles. All these activities that the Soviet Union and the U.S. are carrying out within the scope of "secret diplomacy" and the various agreements they are seeking are actually another link in the chain of the Soviet-U.S. counter-revolutionary comprehensive cooperation. This counter-revolutionary comprehensive cooperation is aimed at opposing the People's Republic of China, opposing the liberation war of the Vietnamese people, and opposing the countries and peoples who do not submit to the intentions of imperialism and revisionism.

	The article pointed out that under the banner of their counter-revolutionary global collusion, U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are trying every means to push forward their common conspiracy against the Vietnamese people through so-called "peace talks." Rusk and Gromyko, using the same tone at the United Nations, hyped up the sincerity of both sides in solving the Vietnamese problem. This is essentially pushing forward Johnson's "peace talks" deception, thereby enabling U.S. imperialism to achieve what it cannot achieve by force, that is, to conquer and enslave the people of South Vietnam. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has already betrayed the liberation war of the Vietnamese people and is preparing to sacrifice the liberation war of the Vietnamese people for the "sacred alliance" of the Soviet Union and the U.S.

	The article said, the Soviet revisionists continue to shamelessly proclaim themselves as friends and supporters of the people of the Arab countries. The "solution" to the Middle East problem advocated by Gromyko and Rusk at the United Nations is to implement the infamous resolution against the Arab people adopted by the Security Council on November 22 last year. This is actually to solve the Middle East problem according to the hegemonic plan of carving up spheres of influence between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and in a way that harms the interests of the Arab people.

	The article concluded that from the first few days of the 23rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, it is quite clear that the United States and the Soviet Union are making every effort to use this organization to realize their ambition to dominate the world. The new counter-revolutionary deal between Rusk and Gromyko once again proves that at present, the Soviet-U.S. counter-revolutionary alliance is the main danger to the freedom and independence of the people of all countries. The freedom, peace, and true security of the people of all countries require the revolutionary people of all countries to direct their main struggle against their common enemies, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

    阿《人民之声报》强烈谴责美苏利用联合国推行瓜分世界的反革命阴谋
    美帝苏修是各国革命人民的共同敌人
    新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十日发表编辑部文章，揭露美帝和苏修利用联合国推行它们划分势力范围的霸权政策的反革命阴谋，强烈谴责美苏策划反对世界各国人民的新的罪恶阴谋。
    文章说，美帝和苏修早就竭力操纵联合国，把联合国当作它们推行反对各国人民的自由和主权利益的阴谋计划的工具，使联合国为美苏两大国划分势力范围和统治世界的霸权政策服务。腊斯克和葛罗米柯这次在联合国大会第二十三届会议上的言论和他们在联合国内外进行的频繁活动，再一次表明美苏两大国在“国际间建设性合作”的幌子下进一步加紧它们的反革命勾结。
    文章指出，腊斯克在联合国的言论再次证明：华盛顿对苏修侵略捷克斯洛伐克并不感到突然；苏修的这次侵略实际上是得到美帝的默契的。
    文章说，从腊斯克和葛罗米柯的言论中可以看出，他们在会谈中为在进攻性和防御性导弹方面达成一项新的苏美协议进行了努力。苏美在“秘密外交”范围内进行的这一切活动以及正在谋求的各种协议，实际上是苏美反革命全面合作链条上的又一个环节。这种反革命全面合作旨在反对中华人民共和国、反对越南人民的解放战争和反对不屈从于帝国主义和修正主义意旨的国家和人民。
    文章指出，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者在他们反革命全球勾结的宗旨下，正在千方百计地企图通过所谓“和谈”来推行他们反对越南人民的共同阴谋。腊斯克和葛罗米柯在联合国用同一个腔调大肆渲染双方对“解决越南问题的诚意”。这实质上是在推行约翰逊的“和谈”欺骗阴谋，从而使美帝得到用武力所不能实现的东西，即征服和奴役越南南方人民。苏修叛徒集团已经出卖了越南人民的解放战争，并为了苏美“神圣同盟”准备葬送越南人民的解放战争。
    文章说，苏联修正主义者继续无耻地宣扬自己是阿拉伯各国人民的朋友和支持者。葛罗米柯和腊斯克在联合国所鼓吹的中近东问题的“解决途径”，就是实施去年十一月二十二日安理会通过的臭名昭著的反对阿拉伯人民的决议。这实际上就是要使中近东问题按照美苏划分势力范围的霸权计划和损害阿拉伯人民利益的办法来解决。
    文章最后说，从联合国大会第二十三届会议的头几天就可以十分清楚地看出，美国和苏联正在竭尽一切努力利用这一组织来实现它们的称霸世界的野心。腊斯克和葛罗米柯新的反革命交易又一次证明：当前，对各国人民的自由和独立来说，苏美反革命联盟是主要的危险。各国人民的自由、和平与真正安全的利益，要求各国革命人民把斗争的主要矛头指向他们共同的敌人美帝国主义和苏联修正主义。
