The revolutionary workers of the Weibei Coal Mine in Shaanxi Province, inspired by the great encouragement of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have vigorously carried out the revolution and vigorously promoted production. They have completed this year's annual coal production plan ahead of schedule by seventy days.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on "carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly" and "fully playing the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work" were issued, they greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of the mine. They firmly declared that Chairman Mao is supporting us workers, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. The entire mine quickly launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Each workshop and team held study classes to propagate, execute, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They immediately organized a large number of excellent workers to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which entered schools and other units that had not carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation well, to lead their struggle, criticism, and transformation. The revolutionary workers who remained in the mine vigorously grasped the class struggle and did not shift it, and carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle. They severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the mine, raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of workers, and promoted the rapid increase in production. At present, the revolutionary workers of the entire mine are advancing victoriously and are determined to produce more coal for the country and achieve new merits.

    陕西省渭北煤矿工农兵矿的广大革命工人，在毛主席一系列最新指示的巨大鼓舞下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前七十天超额完成了今年全年原煤生产计划。
    伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”和“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的光辉指示发表后，极大地鼓舞了工农兵矿的广大革命工人。他们坚定地表示，毛主席给我们工人阶级撑腰，我们一定要给毛主席争气。全矿很快掀起了一个群众性的活学活用毛主席最新指示的新高潮。各工段、各班组都举办了宣传、执行、落实毛主席最新指示的学习班。并且立即抽调大批优秀工人组成毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻学校和其他没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，领导那里的斗、批、改。留矿的革命职工，狠抓阶级斗争不转向，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本矿代理人所推行的“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，提高了广大职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了生产的迅速上升。目前，全矿革命职工正在乘胜前进，决心为国家增产更多的煤炭，再立新功。
