A large delegation from Japan's monopoly capital groups recently visited Indonesia, engaging in intense activities to further facilitate the large-scale infiltration of Japanese capital into the country. The delegation, led by Shinichi Takasugi, the chairman of the Indonesian Committee of Japan's "Federation of Economic Organizations," and Kaijitsu Iwasaka, the president of Fuji Bank, included representatives from various industries such as steel, electronics, non-ferrous metals, textiles, and cement.

During their activities in Indonesia from September 29 to October 9, the delegation held frequent meetings with Indonesian fascist regime officials responsible for the economy and some Indonesian comprador capitalists. They intensively planned for the infiltration of Japanese capital into Indonesia. In these meetings, representatives of Japanese monopoly capital openly demanded that the Indonesian fascist regime sign an "agreement to guarantee capital investment" with the Japanese reactionary government to provide more favorable conditions for Japanese capital to enter Indonesia.

The head of the Indonesian fascist regime, Suharto, received this delegation. He expressed his welcome to Japanese monopoly capital investing in Indonesia.

    日本垄断资本代表团到印尼活动
    日本垄断资本集团最近派出了一个庞大的代表团去印度尼西亚，为日本垄断资本进一步大规模地侵入印尼进行了紧张的活动。这个代表团，由日本垄断资本的大本营——“经济团体联合会”的印度尼西亚委员会委员长高杉晋一为团长，富士银行董事长岩佐凯实为副团长。代表团团员中包括了日本钢铁、电机、有色金属、纺织、水泥等工业方面的垄断资本的代表。
    这个代表团从九月二十九日到十月九日在印度尼西亚活动期间，同印尼法西斯政权负责经济的部长们和印尼的一些买办资本家进行了频繁的会谈，为日本资本侵入印尼进行了紧张的策划。这些日本垄断资本的代表在会谈中公开要求印尼法西斯政权同日本反动政府缔结“保障资本投资的协议”，为日本资本侵入印尼提供更优惠的条件。
    印尼法西斯政权的头目苏哈托接见了这个代表团。他表示欢迎日本垄断资本向印尼投资。
