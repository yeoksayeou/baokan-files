The revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women" is filled with a strong fighting spirit and a thick "gunpowder smell," praising the glorious ideology of people's war. Look, the Red Detachment of Women, each with a heroic bearing, shoulder rifles, and wield large knives. These are the daughters of the Chinese nation! Look, Hong Changqing leads the detachment to defend their positions, bravely fighting the enemy amidst a hail of bullets. No matter how fierce the enemy's artillery, the red flag of the Red Detachment of Women always waves proudly on the battlefield. This ballet is truly inspiring! We workers love to watch such performances.

However, for a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the literary and artistic circles, such as Zhou Yang, have opposed the portrayal of revolutionary wars in literary works, claiming that "it's all about fighting, death, and revolution... how can that be?" They shout at the top of their lungs that "the gunpowder smell is too strong, and armed struggle is too prominent." Under their control, they perform over and over again those vague and sentimental ballets like "Swan Lake" and "The Little Mermaid," trying to corrupt our minds and restore capitalism. This is nothing but a pipe dream! We workers do not like to watch those performances with dancers in light veils, twisting and turning!

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." The more a handful of class enemies oppose and fear the revolutionary "gunpowder smell," the more we must support and welcome it. The revolutionary "gunpowder smell" has brought us the world of the proletariat; the revolutionary "gunpowder smell" will inspire us, the working class, to follow Chairman Mao and fight to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat!

### 革命的“火药味”好

    革命的“火药味”好
    北京二七机车车辆厂工人　李学敏
    革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，以强烈的战斗气息和浓厚的火药味，歌颂了人民战争的光辉思想。看，红色娘子军们一个个飒爽英姿，肩扛五尺枪，手舞大砍刀。这就是中华民族的儿女！看，洪常青带领娘子军坚守阵地，冒着枪林弹雨奋勇杀敌，不管敌人的炮火多么猛烈，娘子军的红旗永远飘扬在阵地上。这就是我们的革命战士！这样的芭蕾舞，真是带劲！我们工人就是爱看这样的戏。
    可是长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫和他在文艺界的代理人周扬一伙，却反对文艺作品表现革命战争，说什么“尽是打仗，死人、闹革命……，怎么行？”声嘶力竭地叫嚷“火药味太浓了，武装斗争太突出了。”在他们的把持下，大演特演那些虚无缥缈、缠缠绵绵的《天鹅湖》和《鱼美人》等乌七八糟的戏，企图用这种东西来腐蚀我们的思想，复辟资本主义。这真是白日做梦！我们工人根本不爱看那些披着轻纱、扭来摆去的舞姿！
    “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。一小撮阶级敌人越是反对和惧怕革命的“火药味”，我们就越要拥护和欢迎革命的“火药味”。革命的“火药味”，给我们带来了无产阶级的天下；革命的“火药味”，将鼓舞着我们工人阶级紧跟毛主席，为巩固无产阶级专政而斗争！
