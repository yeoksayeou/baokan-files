	The waves of the East China Sea roll beneath our feet,
	In front of our door, green pines and cypresses stand.
	For nineteen years, we've guarded the frontline by the East China Sea,
	Through wind and rain, we've protected the border.
	Soldiers miss Chairman Mao,
	So many emotions well up in our hearts.
	When we think of you, we smile sweetly in our dreams,
	When we think of you, our energy is renewed.
	How many times have we stood at our posts,
	And seen the dawn break over Beijing.
	How many times have we gone on patrol,
	And seen Chairman Mao smiling at us.
	When we think of you, we have the courage of steel and iron,
	We do not retreat in the face of fierce winds and waves.
	When we think of you, our ambitions soar to the heavens,
	We face thunder and lightning with smiles.
	When we think of you, we do not feel the cold of ice and snow,
	Our hearts hold the radiant sun.
	When we think of you, we do not feel the bitterness of sun and rain,
	We climb mountains and cross rivers without fatigue.
	Nineteen years of glorious time,
	Nineteen years of welcoming spring and sending it away.
	Nineteen years of sunshine and rain nurturing new buds,
	Nineteen years of you nurturing our revolutionary new generation.
	Nineteen years, the sky is blue, the water is green, and the flag is red,
	Nineteen years, the waves crash, the wind blows, and the pines are evergreen.
	Nineteen years of soldiers' loyalty burning like fire,
	Nineteen years of following you, never turning back.
	Looking at the continents, the clouds and waters rage,
	Listening to the four seas, the wind and thunder roar.
	The soldiers' responsibilities are heavy,
	We will never retreat from revolution.
	"To sweep away all harmful elements,"
	Your great teachings are in our hearts.
	The revolutionary scene is infinitely beautiful,
	Our confidence in victory increases tenfold.
	Our best wishes to you:
	Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!

    胸有红日放光辉
    金旭升
    脚下滔滔东海水，
    门前苍苍松柏翠。
    东海前哨十九年啊，
    风风雨雨守边陲。
    战士思念毛主席啊，
    多少激情胸中汇。
    想起您，梦中笑声甜，
    想起您，浑身干劲添。
    多少回咱在哨位，
    看得见北京城里尽朝晖。
    多少回咱去巡逻，
    看得见毛主席对咱笑颜开。
    想起您，钢筋铁骨英雄胆，
    狂风恶浪不后退。
    想起您，壮志豪情冲云天，
    雷轰电击含笑对！
    想起您，冰封雪盖不觉冷，
    胸有红日放光辉。
    想起您，日晒雨淋不觉苦，
    跋山涉水不觉累。
    十九年岁月灿烂辉煌，
    十九年送春去啊迎春归。
    十九年阳光雨露绽新蕾，
    十九年您哺育我们革命新一辈。
    十九年啊，天蓝水碧旗更红，
    十九年啊，浪打风吹松更翠。
    十九年战士忠心红似火，
    十九年跟您前进头不回。
    看五洲，云水怒，
    听四海，起风雷。
    战士身上责任重，
    永远革命不后退。
    “要扫除一切害人虫”，
    伟大教导记心内。
    革命美景无限好，
    胜利信心增万倍。
    最好的祝愿献给您：
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
