Wuhan Biological Products Research Institute sends 80% of office staff to labor
Promotes cadre revolutionization and pushes forward the unit's struggle, criticism, and reform
Revolutionary committee leaders often labor with workers, accepting supervision and assistance from the masses

	WUHAN, Oct. 10 (Xinhua) -- The revolutionary committee of Wuhan Biological Products Research Institute, with the help of the PLA's support team, closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. It has thoroughly smashed the bad habits of the exploiting class, such as detaching from labor and the masses and acting like officials and lords. It has firmly established Chairman Mao's advocacy of cadres participating in labor, "being both an 'official' and a common person," and the revolutionary style of the proletariat. It has abolished the offices and sent about 80% of the office staff to the workshops to labor with the workers. The remaining office staff have moved their desks to the workshops to solve problems on the spot and participate in labor. This has given cadres a good opportunity to re-learn, effectively promoting the revolutionization of cadres' thoughts, strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses, and pushing the struggle, criticism, and reform of the entire institute to a new high.

	In April this year, the revolutionary committee of the institute, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," merged the seven offices and one department into three groups and one department. Originally, 96 office cadres were sent to the workshops to participate in production labor, with 76 of them being sent down. These cadres, having been influenced by bourgeois ideology for a long time, felt that they had been in the office for many years and had some merits and hardships. Now, wearing work clothes and working with the workers, they felt it was not good for their face. Some cadres who had taken the wrong side in the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution felt that they were driven out of the office and had grievances in their hearts. The revolutionary committee carefully analyzed these situations and believed that the main reason for these active thoughts was that these cadres did not fully understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching on cadres participating in labor. Therefore, the revolutionary committee organized the sent-down cadres to seriously study Chairman Mao's great teachings on cadres participating in labor and the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants. They guided everyone to raise the question of what attitude to take towards participating in labor to the height of whether they are loyal to Chairman Mao and whether they can revolutionize to the end. Through study, the cadres deeply realized that Chairman Mao's teaching on cadres participating in labor is the greatest concern and love for cadres. Cadres going down to labor is the necessary path for cadres to achieve thought revolutionization, the guiding light for cadres to maintain revolutionary youth, the long-term plan to prevent revisionism, and an important measure to carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform well. On the basis of raising awareness, the revolutionary committee further guided everyone to combine the actual situation of the institute and thoroughly criticize the revisionist black goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "expert management" and "reading books to become officials." After the cadres' awareness was raised, they all brought a strong desire to transform their worldview, with the attitude of being willing to be a small student of the masses, deeply entering the workshops and teams, learning, laboring, and fighting with the workers. They deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their studies, cultivated feelings for workers and peasants in their labor, and raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in their battles, determined to change their thoughts and feelings completely.

	To enable cadres to better learn from the worker masses in labor and more effectively promote the revolutionization of cadres' thoughts, the revolutionary committee of the Biological Products Research Institute often organizes them to discuss the gains and experiences of participating in labor, summarize the experiences of cadres going down to labor, and promptly praise and promote good examples when they are found. The broad worker masses care about the thought reform of each cadre, giving enthusiastic encouragement for every bit of their progress; they sincerely criticize and enthusiastically help with their shortcomings. The enthusiastic help from the broad worker masses greatly promoted the cadres' self-awareness of learning from the worker masses, making them more confident and courageous to transform themselves. They study Chairman Mao's works with the workers, recall bitterness and sweetness together, struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism together, with the attitude of a small student, humbly learning the excellent qualities of the workers, and striving to transform their subjective world. In just a few months, some of them were rated as active elements in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, receiving praise from the broad revolutionary masses.

	The leaders of the revolutionary committee of Wuhan Biological Products Research Institute always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely and thoroughly serving the people," always regarding themselves as ordinary laborers. In the face of heavy tasks and few personnel, they often go deep into the teams and workshops, insisting on participating in labor. The leaders of the revolutionary committee, except for collective study and meetings, leave only one person on duty, and the rest of the comrades spend most of their time laboring with the workers, long-term accepting the supervision and help of the worker masses. This not only greatly promoted the revolutionization of the thoughts of the leaders of the revolutionary committee but also further strengthened the connection between cadres and the masses, laying a solid foundation for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform of the entire institute well.

	Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "A large number of cadres going down to labor is a good opportunity for cadres to re-learn. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, everyone should do this. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." The members of the revolutionary committee of Wuhan Biological Products Research Institute and the broad cadres have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest teaching, reviewing their laborization process over the past few months, and have a deeper understanding that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest concern and education for the broad cadres. Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, all the cadres and intellectuals in the institute urgently hope to further improve the system of cadres going down to labor, and promptly organized the "May 7th Labor Teams" to take turns going to the countryside to participate in labor, better walking the road of combining with workers and peasants. They are determined to unswervingly follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, revolutionize for life, labor for life, accept the re-education of workers and peasants for life, and be faithful servants of the people for life.

    武汉生物制品研究所把百分之八十的科室人员下放劳动
    促进干部革命化  推动本单位斗批改
    革委会领导成员也经常和工人一起劳动，接受群众的监督和帮助
    据新华社武汉十日电　武汉生物制品研究所革命委员会，在解放军支左人员帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大破脱离劳动，脱离群众，做官当老爷的剥削阶级坏作风，大立毛主席亲自倡导的干部参加劳动，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的无产阶级革命作风，撤销了科室，把大约百分之八十的科室人员下放到班组与工人一起参加劳动；其余的科室人员，也把办公桌搬到班组，就地解决问题，参加劳动。这样，使干部得到了重新学习的好机会，有力地促进了干部思想革命化，密切了干部和群众的关系，把全所的斗、批、改推向了新高潮。
    今年四月，这个所的革委会遵循毛主席“精兵简政”的伟大教导，把全所七科一室合并成三组一室，原先的九十六名科室干部，下放七十六人到班组参加生产劳动。这些干部由于长期受资产阶级思想影响，刚到生产第一线时，有的认为：自己坐办公室十几年了，没有功劳也有苦劳，现在穿起工作服和工人一起干活，感到面子不好看。个别在无产阶级文化大革命初期站错队的干部，则认为自己是被撵出办公室的，心里有怨气。革委会认真分析了这些情况，认为产生这些活思想的主要原因，是这些干部对毛主席提出的干部参加劳动的伟大意义认识不够。于是，革委会组织下放干部认真学习了毛主席关于干部参加劳动和知识分子同工农兵相结合的伟大教导，并引导大家把对参加劳动抱什么态度，提高到忠不忠于毛主席和能不能革命到底的高度来认识。通过学习，干部们深刻认识到：毛主席关于干部参加劳动的教导，是对干部的最大关怀、最大爱护。干部下放劳动，是干部实现思想革命化的必由之路，是干部永葆革命青春的指路明灯，是反修、防修的千年大计，是搞好斗、批、改的重要措施。在提高认识的基础上，革委会又引导大家结合本所的实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“专家治厂”、“读书做官”论等反革命修正主义黑货。干部们的思想认识提高后，个个带着改造世界观的强烈愿望，以甘当群众小学生的态度，深入车间、班组，跟工人同学习，同劳动，同战斗。他们在学习中加深对毛主席最新指示的理解，在劳动中培养工农兵的感情；在战斗中提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，决心使自己的思想感情来一个脱胎换骨的改变。
    为了使干部在劳动中更好地向工人群众学习，更有效地促进干部的思想革命化，生物制品研究所革命委员会经常组织他们畅谈参加劳动的收获、体会，总结干部下放劳动的经验，一发现好的典型，就及时表扬，大力推广。广大工人群众人人关心干部的思想改造，对他们一点一滴的进步，都给予热情的鼓励；对他们的缺点给以诚恳的批评和热情的帮助。广大工人群众的热情帮助，大大促进了干部向工人群众学习的自觉性，使他们增强了脱胎换骨的勇气和信心。他们和工人一起学习毛主席著作，一起忆苦思甜，一起斗私批修，以小学生的态度，虚心学习工人的优秀品质，努力改造自己的主观世界。在短短几个月内，他们有的被评为活学活用毛主席著作积极分子，受到广大革命群众的赞扬。
    武汉生物制品研究所革委会的领导成员，牢记毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，时刻把自己当成普通劳动者，在任务重、人员少的情况下，经常深入班、组，坚持参加劳动。革委会的领导成员，除集体学习、开会外，只留下一人值班，其他同志大部分时间都和工人们在一起劳动，长期接受工人群众的监督和帮助。这样不仅大大促进了革委会领导成员的思想革命化，而且进一步密切了干部同群众的联系，为搞好全所的斗、批、改打下了坚实的基础。
    毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”武汉生物制品研究所革委会的成员和广大干部反复学习毛主席的这一最新教导，回顾自己几个月来走过的劳动化的战斗历程，更加深切地体会到，毛主席的最新指示是对广大干部的最大爱护，最大教育。在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，全所在职干部和知识分子迫切要求进一步健全干部下放劳动的制度，雷厉风行地组织了“五·七劳动队”，轮流到农村去参加劳动，更好地走与工农兵相结合的道路。他们决心坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的方向走下去，革命一辈子，劳动一辈子，一辈子接受工农兵的再教育，一辈子做人民的忠实勤务员。
