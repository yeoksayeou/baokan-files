The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must select students from among workers and peasants who have practical experience, send them to school for a few years, and then have them return to production practice." Li Wanxi, the main leader of the leadership cadre of the Ninth Brigade of Dabaidu Village in Huai'an County, Hebei Province, has walked this bright path.

Li Wanxi was born into a lower-middle peasant family. In July 1954, after graduating from primary school, he responded to Chairman Mao's call to return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production and became a production expert. In July 1960, the poor and lower-middle peasants sent him to Hebei Agricultural University. In August 1964, after graduating from university, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings and returned to his hometown to become a peasant again. These four years were the years when Li Wanxi actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, tempered and grown in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. These four years were the years when Li Wanxi combined the scientific knowledge he learned at the university with production practice. These four years were the years when Li Wanxi had great achievements in transforming both his subjective and objective worlds in the vast countryside.

Fighting for Chairman Mao and the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

On July 5, 1960, the Party and the people sent Li Wanxi to Hebei Agricultural University. The entire village of poor and lower-middle peasants was overjoyed to have their first peasant university student, so when he left the mountain village, everyone sent him off again and again, with countless admonitions: "Wanxi, it is Chairman Mao who sent you to university, so you must make him proud!"

This "poor mountain lad," wearing homemade shoes and coarse cloth, with boundless proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, carrying the trust of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and with the determination to learn scientific knowledge and contribute to the construction of a new socialist countryside, entered Hebei Agricultural University.

That year, Hebei Agricultural University enrolled a total of sixty peasant students. However, under the persecution of the Khrushchev revisionist educational line, thirty-six peasant students were forced to drop out in an examination in 1962. Li Wanxi had only completed primary school, so he naturally faced many difficulties in his studies. Under such pressure, whether to continue studying or drop out, he was a bit undecided. So, he wrote a letter to the village Party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants, seeking their opinions. The Party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants replied: "Chairman Mao sent you to university, and the Party and the people entrusted you to go to university, so you must make Chairman Mao and us poor and lower-middle peasants proud! No matter how great the difficulties, you must overcome them." After receiving the reply, Li Wanxi became more determined. Not only did he continue to study, but he also, together with his classmates, used Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds and fought against the revisionist educational system, teaching content, and teaching methods.

In August 1964, with the encouragement of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the help of his classmates, Li Wanxi finally completed the learning task entrusted to him by the Party and the people and graduated from university.

Returning to Production and Uniting with the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All such intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should gladly go there. The countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things." Li Wanxi, carrying the golden "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," followed Chairman Mao's great teachings and returned to his hometown to become a peasant again.

Upon his return to the village, he was warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. They had great expectations for him and earnestly told him: "Wanxi, you've finally returned. Now our countryside needs people like you. Let's change the face of this poor mountain valley together and build it into a new socialist countryside." However, some people secretly spread cold winds and poured cold water, laughing at him for being "useless," saying that he either made a mistake or couldn't make it in the outside world and returned to till the soil.

During his four years at the university, Li Wanxi resisted and fought against the revisionist educational line, but the comfortable university life also had some influence on his thoughts. Upon returning to the countryside, although he participated in labor every day, he was not as vigorous as before entering the university. Once, when the team was fertilizing, the community members stood indifferently in the manure pit, but Li Wanxi hesitated at the edge of the manure pit, picking up a shovel of dirt and throwing a handful of grass, refusing to go into the manure pit. Those who spread cold winds released more cold air, saying: "Li Wanxi becoming a peasant is like a rabbit's tail, it won't last long." At this time, the class enemies also took the opportunity to spread rumors. A bad element even composed a rhyme to mock him. An old poor peasant had long noticed Li Wanxi's shortcomings and seen through the class enemies' provocations. One evening, this old poor peasant visited Li Wanxi's home and had a heart-to-heart talk with him, saying: "Wanxi, you are a son of the poor and lower-middle peasants. With Chairman Mao supporting us, you were able to go to university. We must make Chairman Mao proud! You must not be like a paper man crossing a river, wet on the surface but the frame still standing." These words deeply moved him. After the old poor peasant left, he pondered over and over again, realizing that since returning to the village, although he participated in labor, there were still many differences between him and the poor and lower-middle peasants. He dressed more carefully, spoke in official tones, and worked picking the light tasks and avoiding the heavy ones, fearing to soil his clothes and wet his shoes. He brought these problems to mind and seriously studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught: "The cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." Chairman Mao's teachings enlightened him, and Li Wanxi realized that fearing to go into the manure pit to work because of dirt was, in essence, having bourgeois dirt in his mind. If he did not seriously reform himself, he would not only fail to become a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause but would also become a "spiritual aristocrat" detached from politics, reality, and the masses. He decided to put down the airs of a university student and truly unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants in thoughts and feelings.

After that, Li Wanxi learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and their revolutionary spirit of selflessness, taking them as examples, and no longer feared dirt and hard work. Wherever there was a need, wherever it was difficult, he went there.

Once, Li Wanxi and the community members went to dredge the hemp that the production team had soaked, and he was the first to jump into the stinking water pit of hemp, working enthusiastically. Although he was covered in stinking mud and dirty water, he did not feel it was dirty. The community members praised him: "Wanxi is really good, he works like a real laborer."

On a day in early April 1965, he and the community members broke the ice to draw water for spring irrigation. Unfortunately, the embankment was washed away, and the community members tried to block it with soil but failed. If the breach became larger, not only would the hundred mu of land in this team not be irrigated, but it would also affect the irrigation of other production teams. Li Wanxi immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and without even taking off his cotton clothes, he "plop" jumped into the icy water. The water was chest-deep, and ice blocks rolled around. He used his body to block the breach and pressed down on four grass handles, allowing the community members to fill the soil. Soon, Li Wanxi's lips turned purple from the cold, and everyone urged him to come up quickly, but he said: "It's okay, you all fill the soil quickly, don't mind me." His whole body was numb from the cold, and his legs were bruised by the ice blocks, but his heart was warm, and he kept shouting: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Inspired by him, the community members also shouted together. After half an hour of battle, the breach was finally blocked. The poor and lower-middle peasants all said with emotion: "Wanxi has not forgotten his roots and walks the same path as us poor and lower-middle peasants."

To persist in the path of uniting with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao is a severe test and a serious class struggle for a knowledgeable youth. Some "well-meaning" people, seeing that Li Wanxi had truly taken root in the countryside, advised him: "Li Wanxi, after the socialist education movement, there is a shortage of people outside, why don't you leave?" Li Wanxi firmly said: "Leave! The path of uniting with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao, I have decided to walk it, and I will walk this bright path for life!"

Theory Combined with Practice: Boldly Conducting Scientific Experiments

The Ninth Brigade is a poor mountain village often hit by natural disasters, with a harvest every nine years. The main crops are corn, millet, and sorghum, all with low yields. After returning to the countryside, Li Wanxi day and night pondered: "How can the crop yield be increased, and more grain be produced?" He thought, the Party and the people sent me to an agricultural university precisely to let me better contribute my strength in the struggle to build a new socialist countryside. If I do not apply what I have learned, how can I repay the poor and lower-middle peasants? How can I repay the Party's cultivation? Therefore, he reported his determination to conduct scientific experiments and cultivate excellent varieties to the Party branch, immediately obtaining the support and help of the Party branch and the poor and lower-middle peasants. Before the spring sowing of 1965, they organized a scientific experiment team composed of old peasants, young people, and cadres. Li Wanxi and the members of the experiment team first studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "humanity must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." The invincible Mao Zedong Thought gave them boundless strength. The members of the experiment team decided to use the method of crossbreeding local and foreign varieties to cultivate excellent varieties and change the low-yield situation. They first conducted a detailed dissection of the local corn varieties and then held a symposium with experienced old poor peasants to jointly study the reasons for the low corn yield and methods to improve the varieties. Based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants and his own production experience, combined with the scientific knowledge learned at school, Li Wanxi proposed conducting a corn double-cross experiment. However, according to the requirements of the book, conducting a corn double-cross experiment within three hundred meters should not plant corn, otherwise, the varieties would easily be mixed during the flowering period. What should be done? "The masses are the real heroes!" The poor and lower-middle peasants, based on the characteristics of long growth period of foreign varieties and strong adaptability of local varieties, proposed the method of early sowing of experimental double-cross corn, thus separating the flowering period and solving the problem of preventing variety mixing, finally making the corn double-cross experiment successful.

While cultivating the corn double-cross, the scientific experiment team also bought fourteen varieties of millet from outside for comparison experiments. After more than two years of observation, identification, and comparison, they finally found millet varieties such as "Big White Millet," "Small White Seedling," and "Second Yellow Millet" with higher yields than the local varieties.

To adapt to the local characteristics of strong winds and sand, Li Wanxi found a sorghum variety called "Wind Killer." However, due to the variety not adapting to the local climate, it all withered before it could fully ripen. The class enemies jumped out again to mock Li Wanxi and the scientific experiment team, saying: "University students plant sorghum but harvest nothing. Experiment, experiment, it's all in vain." At this time, Li Wanxi and the members of the experiment team also feared failure and criticism. The poor and lower-middle peasants encouraged them, saying, "Dare to do it! Children learning to walk, who doesn't fall a few times? Remember Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, raise our courage.'" Chairman Mao's teachings and the encouragement of the poor and lower-middle peasants increased everyone's confidence and courage, overcoming various difficulties, and finally succeeded in the experiment, greatly increasing the sorghum yield.

The mole cricket is the most harmful underground pest in the area. Due to many years of using lime, the mole cricket has developed resistance to this drug. Li Wanxi used the method of using DDT powder to kill insects learned at school and experimented on a piece of land. The next day, he saw that the insects were killed, but the crops were also burned. At this time, the class enemies took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying: "The fool expert wants the people of the Ninth Brigade to drink west wind." Li Wanxi was not discouraged and, together with the old peasants, repeatedly conducted experiments. Finally, they found the method of mixing DDT with rotten grains to make poison bait, which had no harm to the crops, strong insecticidal power, and good insecticidal effect.

Li Wanxi took the poor and lower-middle peasants as his teachers, united with them, combined theory with practice, and achieved results in agricultural scientific experiments, increasing the yield of the three main crops of corn, millet, and sorghum by more than three times. Now, the entire brigade has achieved varietal improvement. In 1966, this brigade also trial-planted 30,000 sweet potato seedlings, with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu, more than doubling the yield of yam. Additionally, Li Wanxi trained more than 130 agricultural science and technology personnel for the entire commune. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "Scientific knowledge plus our own experience is effective."

In the Storms of Class Struggle

Li Wanxi was tempered and grown in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and the poor and lower-middle peasants trusted him and elected him as the brigade leader.

After becoming the brigade leader, Li Wanxi had a lot of work to do. He grasped the essence and put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place, actively and enthusiastically promoting Mao Zedong Thought, gaining the support and trust of the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, the class enemies saw him as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat. Even when Li Wanxi first returned to the village, the person who mocked and attacked him the most during the Cultural Revolution manipulated some deceived masses to threaten him in various ways. Big-character posters to overthrow Li Wanxi rained down on him. The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly supported Li Wanxi, caring for him and saying: "Wanxi, don't be afraid! If the sky falls, we will support it together!" The flames of class struggle made Li Wanxi's heart beat closer to the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. He remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forgetting class struggle" and united closely with the poor and lower-middle peasants, fighting together. In the face of the class enemies' attacks, Li Wanxi remained unshakable, constantly drawing boundless strength from Chairman Mao's works: "If the enemy opposes us, that's good, that means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy." Under the encouragement of Chairman Mao's teachings and the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Li Wanxi fought resolutely against the enemy. When the counter-revolutionary economicist wind blew into the countryside, some deceived students in the agricultural middle school flocked to him asking for connection fees, he patiently and enthusiastically propagated Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" to the deceived masses, propagated the great significance of making a revolution on the spot, raised the masses' awareness of the two-line struggle, and resisted the economicist wind.

Li Wanxi, this new-type intellectual and new-type peasant who has walked the path of uniting with peasants for fourteen years, is determined, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to continue to strive forward bravely.

    农民——大学生——农民
    记在毛泽东思想指引下坚决同贫下中农相结合的知识青年李万喜
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”河北省怀安县头百户公社第九屯大队领导班子的主要负责人李万喜，走的正是这样一条光明大道。
    李万喜生在一个下中农家里，一九五四年七月高小毕业以后，响应毛主席的号召，回乡参加农业生产劳动，成了生产能手。一九六○年七月，贫下中农保送他进了河北农业大学。一九六四年八月大学毕业以后，他遵照毛主席的教导，又回到家乡当了农民。这四年是李万喜活学活用毛泽东思想，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中锻炼成长的四年，是李万喜把他从大学里学到的科学知识同生产实践相结合的四年，是李万喜在农村这个广阔的天地里改造主观和客观世界大有作为的四年。
    为毛主席和贫下中农争气
    一九六○年七月五日，党和人民把李万喜送进了河北农业大学。全村的贫下中农为自己有了第一个农民大学生而高兴，因此当他离开山村的时候，大家送了一程又一程，千嘱咐万叮咛：“万喜，是毛主席让你上了大学，你可要为他老人家争气啊！”
    这位“穷山沟”的农民，脚穿家做鞋，身着粗布衣，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，带着贫下中农的委托，抱着学到科学知识，为建设社会主义新农村作出贡献的决心，进了河北农业大学。
    这一年，河北农大一共招收了六十名农民学生。但是，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的迫害下，一九六二年的一次考试中，就有三十六名农民学生被迫退了学。李万喜原来只念过小学，学习上当然会有不少困难，在这种压力之下，是继续学习，还是退学，他有点拿不定主意。于是，他就给本村党支部和贫下中农写信，征求他们的意见。党支部和贫下中农给他回信说：“毛主席他老人家让你上大学，党和人民委托你上大学，可要为毛主席和咱贫下中农争气呀！天大的困难，你也要把它顶住。”李万喜接到回信以后，坚定了信心，不但继续坚持学习，而且和同班同学一起用毛泽东思想武装头脑，向修正主义教育制度、教学内容和教学方法进行了斗争。
    一九六四年八月，李万喜在贫下中农的鼓励和同学们的帮助下，终于完成了党和人民交给他的学习任务，大学毕业了。
    重新回到生产中同贫下中农相结合
    毛主席教导我们：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”李万喜带着金光闪闪的《毛泽东选集》，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，又回到家乡当了农民。
    他一回村，就受到了贫下中农的欢迎。大家对他寄托着很大希望，语重心长地对他说：“万喜，你可回来了，现在咱农村正需要你这样的人，咱们一起改天换地，把咱这穷山沟的面貌好好改变改变，建设成一个社会主义的新农村。”可是，也有些人在背地里吹凉风，泼冷水，笑他“没出息”，说他不是犯了错误，就是在外边混不下去了才回来泥手泥脚地当庄户人。
    在大学的四年中，李万喜虽然对修正主义教育路线作了抵制和斗争，但是，舒适的大学生活，对他的思想也产生了一些影响。回到农村，他虽然天天参加劳动，但是干起活来，不如进大学以前那样泼辣了。有一次队里积肥，社员们都是满不在乎地站在粪坑里干，李万喜却在粪坑边上打转转，铲一锹土，扔一把草，硬是不敢下到粪坑里去。那些吹冷风的人，又放出了冷气，说：“李万喜当农民是兔子尾巴，长不了。”这时，阶级敌人也见缝下蛆，散布流言蜚语。有一个坏分子还编了一段顺口溜嘲笑他。有一位老贫农早就看出了李万喜的缺点，也看透了阶级敌人的挑衅。一天晚上，这位老贫农找到李万喜家里和他谈心，对他说：“万喜，你是咱贫下中农的子弟，有毛主席他老人家给咱撑腰，你才能上了大学，咱可要为毛主席争气啊！你可不能象纸糊的人过河，表面湿了，架子不倒。”这一席话使他很受感动。老贫农走了以后，他翻来复去地琢磨，自己回村以后，虽然参加了劳动，但是还有好多和贫下中农不一样的地方，穿的衣服比贫下中农讲究，说起话来好打官腔，干起活来拈轻怕重，既怕脏了衣服又怕湿了鞋。他带着这些问题，认真学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”毛主席的教导，照得他心明眼亮，李万喜认识到，到粪坑里去干活怕脏，实质上是自己思想上有了资产阶级的脏东西。如果不认真改造自己，不仅不能成为一个无产阶级革命事业的接班人，还会变成一个脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的“精神贵族”。他决心放下大学生的架子，从思想感情上真正同贫下中农相结合。
    这以后，李万喜处处学习贫下中农无限忠于毛主席的高尚品质和一心为公的革命精神，以贫下中农为榜样，干起活来，再也不怕脏和累了。哪里需要，哪里艰苦，他就到哪里去。
    一次，李万喜和社员们一起去打捞生产队沤的麻，他第一个跳到了沤麻的臭水坑里，起劲地干起来，虽然弄了一身臭泥脏水，可他并不觉得臭和脏了。社员们夸奖他：“万喜这孩子真行，象个干活的。”
    一九六五年四月初的一天，他和社员们一起破冰引水，春灌土地，不料渠坝被冲开了一个口子，社员们用土怎么也堵不住。如果决口再大，不但本队的上百亩土地灌不上水，还要影响其他生产大队的灌溉。李万喜当即想起了毛主席关于“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，连棉衣也没有脱，就“扑咚”一声跳入了冰水中。水深齐胸，冰块滚滚，他用身体堵住决口，两手按住四个草把子，让社员们填土。不一会，李万喜的嘴唇冻紫了，大伙劝他赶快上来，他说：“不要紧，你们快填土吧，不要管我。”他全身冻得麻木了，腿被冰块碰破了，可是他的心却是热的，嘴里不断地喊着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在他的带动下，社员们也一起喊了起来。经过半个小时的战斗，决口终于被堵住了。贫下中农都感动地说：“万喜这孩子，没有忘本，和咱贫下中农走的还是一条路子。”
    坚持走毛主席指引的同工农相结合的道路，对一个知识青年来说，是一场严峻的考验，是一场严肃的阶级斗争。有些“好心人”见李万喜真的在农村扎根了，就劝他说：“李万喜，经过社会主义教育运动，外边可是缺人呀，你还不走？”李万喜坚定地说：“走！毛主席指引的知识分子同工农相结合的道路，我是走定了，我要在这条阳关大道上走一辈子！”
    理论联系实际大胆进行科学实验
    第九屯是个常常遭受自然灾害，十年九不收的穷山村，主要作物是玉米、谷子和高粱，产量都很低。李万喜回乡后日夜思索着：“怎样才能提高作物产量，多打粮食？”他想，党和人民送我进农业大学，就是为了让我在建设社会主义新农村的斗争中更好地贡献力量，如果我不把学到的东西用上，怎能对得起贫下中农呢？怎能对得起党的培养呢？于是，他把要进行科学实验，培育良种，向大自然开战的决心向党支部作了汇报，立即得到了党支部和贫下中农的支持和帮助。一九六五年春播前，他们组织了有老农、青年、干部参加的科学实验小组，李万喜和实验小组的同志一起，首先学习了毛主席关于“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给他们增添了无穷无尽的力量。实验小组的同志决心用外地和本地品种杂交的办法，培育优良品种，改变低产状况。他们首先对本地玉米品种进行了详细解剖，接着又召开了有经验的老贫农座谈会，共同研究玉米产量低的原因和改良品种的办法。李万喜根据贫下中农的意见和自己的生产经验，结合在学校里学到的科学知识，提出进行玉米双交种实验。可是按照书本上的要求，搞玉米双交种实验，在三百米以内不能种玉米，否则玉米扬花时容易把品种混杂了。怎么办呢？“群众是真正的英雄”！贫下中农根据外地品种生长期长和本地品种适应性强的特点，提出了实验双交种的玉米提前播种的办法，这样把扬花时间错开，就解决了防止品种混杂的问题，终于使培育玉米双交种的实验成功了。
    在培育玉米双交种的同时，科学实验小组还从外地买来了十四样品种的谷子进行了对比实验，经过两年多的观察、鉴定、对比，终于找出了比当地产量高的“大白谷”、“小白苗”、“二黄谷”等谷子品种。
    为了适应当地风沙大的特点，李万喜找到了一种名叫“气死风”的高粱品种，由于这种品种不适应当地气候，没等出全穗就全部枯死了。阶级敌人又跳出来嘲笑李万喜和科学实验小组，胡说什么：“大学生种高粱一颗不收。实验实验，就是白干。”这时，李万喜和实验小组的同志，也怕搞不好受埋怨。贫下中农鼓励他们说，大胆地干吧！小孩子学走路，有几个不摔跤的？要牢记毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的教导，贫下中农的鼓励，使大家增强了信心，提高了勇气，克服了各种困难，终于实验成功，大大提高了高粱产量。
    蝼蛄是当地地下虫害最厉害的一种害虫。由于多年使用信石，蝼蛄对这种药产生了抵抗力。李万喜用在学校里学的六六六粉灭虫的办法，找了一块地进行实验。第二天一看，虫子杀死了，可是庄稼也烧死了。这时，阶级敌人又借机放风说：“胡闹专家想让第九屯的人喝西北风了。”李万喜并没有灰心，和老农们一起又反复进行实验。最后终于找到了用六六六和秕谷子拌成毒饵的方法，对庄稼既没有损害，杀虫力又强，灭虫效果也很好。
    李万喜拜贫下中农为师，与贫下中农相结合，理论联系实际，在农业科学实验上取得了成果，使玉米、谷子、高粱三种主要作物产量提高了三倍多。现在，全大队已经实现了良种化。这个大队在一九六六年又试种了三万株红薯，亩产一千多斤，比种山药增产一倍多。另外，李万喜还为全公社培训了一百三十多名农业科学技术员。贫下中农高兴地说：“科学知识加上咱自己的经验，就是管事。”
    在阶级斗争的风浪中锻炼成长
    李万喜在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中经受了考验，贫下中农信得过，选他当了生产大队长。
    李万喜当了队长以后，工作千头万绪，狠抓根本，把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，积极热情地宣传毛泽东思想，得到了贫下中农的拥护和支持，但是阶级敌人却把他看成了眼中钉，肉中刺。就是在李万喜刚回村时，极力嘲笑和打击他的那个家伙，在文化大革命中操纵了一些受蒙蔽的群众，千方百计地对他进行威胁。要打倒李万喜的大字报劈头盖脑地向他压来。贫下中农坚决支持李万喜，关怀地对他说：“万喜，不要怕！天塌了我们和你一起顶住！”阶级斗争的烈火，使李万喜的心和贫下中农的心贴得更紧了。他牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，和贫下中农紧紧地团结在一起，战斗在一起。在阶级敌人的进攻面前，李万喜毫不动摇，不断从毛主席著作中汲取无穷的力量：“如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了”，在毛主席教导的鼓舞下，在贫下中农的支持下，李万喜同敌人作了坚决的斗争。当反革命经济主义歪风刮到农村，农业中学有一些受蒙蔽的学生纷纷找他要串连费时，他耐心地热情地向受蒙蔽的群众宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，宣传就地闹革命的重大意义，提高了群众的两条路线斗争觉悟，顶住了经济主义歪风。
    李万喜这个在与农民相结合的道路上走了十四年的新型知识青年、新型农民，决心在毛泽东思想的指引下，再接再厉，奋勇前进。
