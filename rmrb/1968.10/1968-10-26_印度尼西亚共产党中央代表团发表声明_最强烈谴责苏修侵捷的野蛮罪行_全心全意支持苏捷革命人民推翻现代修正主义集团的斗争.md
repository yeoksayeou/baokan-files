The Indonesian Communist Party Central Delegation issued a statement strongly condemning the savage crimes of the Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia. The statement fully supports the struggle of the Czechoslovak and Soviet revolutionary people to overthrow the modern revisionist clique.

	New China News Agency, October 25th -- The Indonesian Communist Party Central Delegation, in September, issued a statement signed by Yusuf Ajitoroep, a member of the Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau and head of the Indonesian Communist Party Central Delegation. The statement is titled: "Indonesian Marxist-Leninists and the Indonesian Revolutionary People Strongly Condemn the Soviet Modern Revisionists' Savage Invasion of Czechoslovakia." The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On August 20, 1968, the Soviet modern revisionists launched a military invasion of Czechoslovakia, with the clear intention of continuing to occupy this country and refusing to withdraw. This barbaric act, in the eyes of the people of the world, not only exposes the Soviet modern revisionists as bankrupt traitors but also reveals them as social imperialists. They claim to be "socialist" but in reality are imperialists. The Soviet modern revisionists claim that their invasion of Czechoslovakia is to "defend socialism," attempting to use this pretext to justify their aggression. It is precisely the Khrushchev revisionist clique that, from the day they usurped the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the state, began to implement a comprehensive capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union. Simultaneously, they fomented a capitalist restoration countercurrent in some socialist countries in Eastern Europe. The Soviet modern revisionist clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin has already fragmented the socialist camp. They are the center of counter-revolutionary activities within the socialist camp, implementing capitalist restoration. They are the center of anti-socialist, anti-revolutionary, anti-people, and anti-communist activities by modern revisionists worldwide. They are the center of the collusion between modern revisionists worldwide and imperialists led by American imperialism. They are the center of traitors worldwide who have become faithful servants of American imperialism. In Czechoslovakia, it is precisely their own lackeys who obediently implement counter-revolutionary and anti-people capitalist restoration.

	Due to the insufficient loyalty of the Dubcek modern revisionist clique to the Soviet modern revisionists, and because this clique wanted to obtain the freedom to sell itself directly to American imperialism, the Soviet modern revisionists instigated their lackeys in Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, and Hungary to launch a savage invasion of Czechoslovakia. To justify their invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet modern revisionists fabricated various lies, but this only further exposed themselves and their lackeys in Poland, Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. This savage invasion incident shows further fragmentation within the modern revisionist camp.

	The invasion of Czechoslovakia by the modern revisionist clique led by the Soviet Communist Party revisionist leadership further exposes the extremely despicable grand conspiracy of the Soviet Communist Party revisionist leadership and American imperialists to redraw the world into their "spheres of influence," i.e., Eastern Europe is the "sphere of influence" of the Soviet modern revisionists, while the Middle East and Southeast Asia (including South Vietnam) are the "sphere of influence" of the Americans. Their despicable conspiracy is to give both sides "freedom of action" in their supposed respective spheres of influence. This is a grand conspiracy that has been strongly condemned and opposed by Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people worldwide. The Soviet modern revisionists, who have become social imperialists, and American imperialists are acting unbridled, dividing the world into their "spheres of influence." This will definitely not succeed. Comrade Mao Zedong has long pointed out: "The peoples of all countries, who make up more than ninety percent of the world's population, will always be revolutionary and will always support Marxism-Leninism. They will not support revisionism; some may temporarily support it, but they will eventually abandon it. They will gradually awaken and will oppose imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, and they will oppose revisionism."

	The Czechoslovakian incident further convincingly educates the revolutionary people of all countries that modern revisionists are rotten and bankrupt.

	In the face of the savage invasion by the Soviet modern revisionists, the Czechoslovakian modern revisionist clique showed their treacherous nature by prohibiting the people from resisting the invasion. Due to the Moscow Agreement, the Czechoslovakian revisionist clique further betrayed the interests of the Czechoslovakian people. However, the heroic Czechoslovakian people, like the great Soviet people and the revolutionary people of Poland, Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary, and other countries suffering from the despicable oppression of modern revisionists, will definitely rise up and ultimately overthrow them from their current ruling positions. The Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of these countries, through the use of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful weapon, will definitely seize back the power usurped by the revisionists, thoroughly overthrow the bourgeois dictatorship, and re-establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Social imperialism—the Soviet modern revisionists and American imperialists—can no longer act with impunity as they did in the era when the "gunboat policy" prevailed. In that era, any big power with cannons could unbridledly impose their will on the oppressed peoples and nations of various countries. That era has passed and will not return.

	Currently, a powerful and eternally red world revolutionary stronghold stands in the world—the great People's Republic of China. Under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has been achieved, making the great People's China even stronger. It has become the strongest stronghold and most reliable support for the world revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further promoted the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, to the world. The revolutionary people of various countries have begun to use this most powerful weapon in their struggles to defeat imperialism led by American imperialism, modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries. In Europe, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, firmly consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system, also standing at the forefront of this struggle. Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people worldwide have already dealt heavy blows to their enemies and are gradually achieving one victory after another. American imperialists and their accomplices, the social imperialists—the Soviet modern revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries—are increasingly bankrupt and on the verge of death. The world revolution has now entered a new era, an era in which imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Modern revisionists will also inevitably meet the same fate as the imperialists.

	American imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists are teetering on the brink, making their last struggles. In Eastern Europe, the Soviet modern revisionists invade Czechoslovakia and continue to occupy this country. In Indonesia, the Soviet modern revisionists further intensify their counter-revolutionary activities, providing economic and military aid to the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime to massacre the progressive people and communists of Indonesia. The Soviet modern revisionists also engage in activities to split the revolutionary ranks of Indonesia, attempting to split the Indonesian Communist Party. The Soviet modern revisionists have also committed the following evil acts: in Moscow, they gathered a small group of traitors from the Indonesian Communist Party, using this small group of historical dregs to intensify their activities of splitting the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian revolutionary people, persecuting Indonesian communists and progressives, and expelling them from the Soviet Union. The Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of Indonesia strongly condemn these counter-revolutionary activities of the Soviet modern revisionists. Currently, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people are engaged in revolutionary armed struggle, overcoming all difficulties, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they will definitely smash the conspiracies of the Soviet modern revisionists against the Indonesian people, definitely smash the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, and definitely achieve final victory.

	The "Self-Criticism" of the Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau points out: "Based on their own struggle experience, Indonesian Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries have no doubt about the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's point that imperialism and reactionaries are paper tigers. They look terrifying, but in reality, they are weak. From a long-term perspective, the truly strong are the people. The current ruling right-wing military leaders' military dictatorship is also a paper tiger. They look strong and terrifying, but in reality, they are weak because they do not have the support of the people but are opposed by the people; they are full of internal contradictions, vying for power and profit."

	The Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of Indonesia strongly condemn the Soviet modern revisionists' savage invasion of Czechoslovakia and fully support the struggle of the Czechoslovakian revolutionary people, the Soviet revolutionary people, and the revolutionary people of other countries to overthrow the modern revisionist cliques oppressing them. The Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of Indonesia firmly believe that the Czechoslovakian revolutionary people will definitely strengthen their struggle against the military occupation of the Soviet modern revisionists and against the Dubcek traitor clique's surrender to the Soviet cannons and tanks, betraying the country and the nation.

	The Czechoslovakian people and the Indonesian people face a common enemy: the imperialists led by the Americans, the Soviet modern revisionists, the Czechoslovakian modern revisionist clique, and the reactionaries who have become their lackeys. As long as they resolutely rely on the people, engage in armed struggle, persist in the long-term struggle, and most importantly, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, then the class enemies and enemies of the people will definitely be defeated!

	Down with the social imperialists—the Soviet modern revisionists!
	Down with the traitorous Czechoslovakian modern revisionist clique!
	Down with American imperialism!
	Long live the revolutionary struggle of the Czechoslovakian people!
	Long live the great Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!

    印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团发表声明
    最强烈谴责苏修侵捷的野蛮罪行
    全心全意支持苏捷革命人民推翻现代修正主义集团的斗争
    新华社二十五日讯　印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团，九月间就苏修叛徒集团武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯罪行，发表了由印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局委员、印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团团长尤素福·阿吉托罗普同志签署的一篇声明，题目是：《印度尼西亚马克思列宁主义者和印度尼西亚革命人民最强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义对捷克斯洛伐克的野蛮侵略》。声明全文如下：
    一九六八年八月二十日，苏联现代修正主义者对捷克斯洛伐克发动武装入侵，其目的日益明显是为了继续占领这个国家，赖着不走。在世界各国人民面前，这个野蛮行动不仅暴露了苏联现代修正主义者是破了产的叛徒，而且它也是社会帝国主义者。它口头上说的是“社会主义”，实际上是帝国主义。苏联现代修正主义者说什么出兵捷克斯洛伐克是为了“保卫社会主义”，企图用这个借口来说明他们对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略是正确的。正是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团自己从它篡夺苏联共产党和国家的领导权的那一天起就在苏联实行全面的资本主义复辟，同时还在东欧的一些社会主义国家掀起资本主义复辟的逆流。以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏联现代修正主义集团已把社会主义阵营搞得分崩离析，它是这个社会主义阵营内部实行资本主义复辟的反革命活动的中心，是全世界现代修正主义者进行反社会主义、反革命、反人民、反共活动的中心。它是全世界现代修正主义者同以美国帝国主义为首的帝国主义者实行投降主义的勾结的中心。它是全世界已成为美国帝国主义的忠实奴仆的叛徒的中心。在捷克斯洛伐克，也正是它们自己的走狗百般依顺地实行反革命、反人民的资本主义复辟。
    由于杜布切克现代修正主义集团对苏联现代修正主义者效忠不够，由于这个集团想取得直接卖身给美国帝国主义的自由权利，所以苏联现代修正主义者策动他们在波兰、东德、保加利亚和匈牙利的走狗，疯狂地对捷克斯洛伐克发动野蛮的侵略。苏联现代修正主义者为了把他们对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略说成是对的，就制造了各种谎言，但这只能更加暴露了他们自己，同时也暴露了他们在波兰、保加利亚、东德、匈牙利的走狗以及他们在捷克斯洛伐克的走狗。这个野蛮侵略事件表明现代修正主义者的阵营内部进一步分崩离析。
    以苏共修正主义领导集团为首的现代修正主义者对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，进一步暴露了苏共修正主义领导集团和美国帝国主义者把世界重新划分为他们的“势力范围”的极其卑鄙的大阴谋，即东欧是苏联现代修正主义者的“势力范围”，而中东和东南亚（包括越南南方）则是美国的“势力范围”。他们的卑鄙阴谋是为了给他们双方在所谓各自的势力范围内“行动的自由”。这是一个大阴谋，它遭到全世界马克思列宁主义者和各国革命人民的强烈谴责和反对。已成为社会帝国主义者的苏联现代修正主义者和美国帝国主义者肆无忌惮地采取行动，把世界划分为他们的“势力范围”，这是一定不会得逞的。毛泽东同志早就指出：“各国的人民，占人口总数的百分之九十以上的人民大众，总是要革命的，总是会拥护马克思列宁主义的。他们不会拥护修正主义，有些人暂时拥护，将来终究会抛弃它。他们总会逐步地觉醒起来，总会反对帝国主义和各国的反动派，总会反对修正主义。”
    捷克斯洛伐克事件更加令人信服地教育了世界各国革命人民，现代修正主义者是腐朽的和破了产的。
    在面对着苏联现代修正主义者的野蛮侵略的时候，捷克斯洛伐克现代修正主义集团表现出他们的叛卖性，他们禁止人民抵抗这个侵略。由于达成莫斯科协议，捷克斯洛伐克修正主义集团进一步出卖了捷克斯洛伐克人民的利益。但是，英雄的捷克斯洛伐克人民，象伟大的苏联人民以及波兰、保加利亚、东德、匈牙利的革命人民和正在受到现代修正主义者的卑鄙压迫的其他国家革命人民一样，一定会起来，终究会把他们从现在的统治地位拉下马。这些国家的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民通过运用马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器，一定会把已被修正主义者篡夺了的政权重新夺回来，彻底推翻资产阶级专政，重新建立无产阶级专政。
    社会帝国主义——苏联现代修正主义者和美国帝国主义者已经不能象在“炮舰政策”占统治地位的时代那样为所欲为了。在那个时代，任何一个拥有大炮的大国都可以肆无忌惮地把自己的意旨强加于各国被压迫人民和民族。那个时代已经一去不复返了。
    目前世界上屹立着一个强大的、永远红彤彤的世界革命堡垒，即伟大的中华人民共和国。在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下取得了中国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，伟大的人民中国更加强大起来了，它成为世界革命的最强大的堡垒和最可信赖的依靠。无产阶级文化大革命也进一步促使当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想传播到全世界，而各国革命人民已开始在斗争中运用这个最强大的武器，来击败以美国帝国主义为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派。在欧洲，阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下坚定地巩固无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，也站在这个斗争的前列。全世界马克思列宁主义者和各国革命人民已经给他们的敌人以沉重的打击，并逐步取得一个又一个的胜利。美国帝国主义者及其帮凶社会帝国主义——苏联现代修正主义者和各国反动派已日益破产，濒于死亡。现在世界革命已进入了新时代，一个帝国主义正在走向全面崩溃，社会主义正在走向全世界胜利的时代。现代修正主义者也同样不可避免地要遇到同帝国主义者一样的下场。
    美国帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者摇摇欲坠，他们正在进行最后的挣扎。在东欧，苏联现代修正主义者侵略捷克斯洛伐克并继续占领这个国家。在印度尼西亚，苏联现代修正主义者更加紧其反革命活动，在经济上和军事上给苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权以援助，用以屠杀印度尼西亚的进步人民和共产党人。苏联现代修正主义者也进行分裂印度尼西亚革命队伍的活动，妄图分裂印度尼西亚共产党。苏联现代修正主义者还进行了下面的罪恶活动：在莫斯科纠集了印度尼西亚共产党的一小撮叛徒，利用这一小撮历史渣滓加紧他们分裂印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚革命人民的勾当，迫害印度尼西亚共产党人和进步人士，并把他们从苏联驱逐出去。印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民最强烈地谴责苏联现代修正主义的这种反革命活动。目前在印度尼西亚共产党领导下进行着革命武装斗争的印度尼西亚人民，正在排除万难，在毛泽东思想的指引下，一定能够粉碎苏联现代修正主义对印度尼西亚人民所进行的阴谋活动，一定能够粉碎苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权，并且一定能够取得最后胜利。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局的《自我批评》指出：“印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者和革命者根据本身的斗争经验，毫不怀疑毛泽东同志的下述论点的正确性，即帝国主义和反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，他们的样子是可怕的，但是实际上他们是虚弱的。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的是人民。现在当权的陆军右派将领军事专政也是纸老虎。他们的样子看起来是强大而又可怕。但实际上他们是虚弱的，因为他们得不到人民的支持，反而为人民所反对；他们本身内部充满了矛盾，互相争权夺利。”
    印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民最强烈地谴责苏联现代修正主义对捷克斯洛伐克的野蛮侵略，全心全意地支持捷克斯洛伐克革命人民、苏联革命人民和其他国家的革命人民为推翻压迫他们的现代修正主义集团所进行的斗争。印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民完全相信，捷克斯洛伐克革命人民一定会加强他们反对苏联现代修正主义者的军事占领和反对在苏联大炮和坦克面前屈膝投降、出卖国家、出卖民族的杜布切克叛徒集团的斗争。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民和印度尼西亚人民面对着共同的敌人，即以美国为首的帝国主义者、苏联现代修正主义者和捷克斯洛伐克现代修正主义集团以及成为他们的走狗的反动派。只要坚决地依靠人民、进行武装斗争、坚持长期斗争，而最重要的是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，那么，阶级敌人和人民的敌人就一定能够被打败！
    打倒社会帝国主义——苏联现代修正主义者！
    打倒叛徒捷克斯洛伐克现代修正主义集团！
    打倒美国帝国主义！
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的革命斗争万岁！
    伟大的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
