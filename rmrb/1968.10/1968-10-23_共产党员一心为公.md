Communists Dedicate Themselves to the Public

The total logistics department of a certain unit nurse, Li Guishun

Khrushchev of China spread the idea that in "ordinary work," one can "become a hero," and so on. He wants revolutionaries to do ordinary work only to become "heroes," otherwise, they absolutely cannot do it. In his eyes, ordinary work is a stepping stone to becoming a "hero," a means to compete for the "hero's laurel." This is extremely reactionary!

Chairman Mao teaches us to "serve the people wholeheartedly" and to "be selfless and dedicated to others." We communists listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and resolutely follow the path he points out. I have been a nurse for twenty whole years, and I have never thought about becoming a personal "hero." I realize that serving the people is the only wish and lifelong mission of a communist. As long as it is beneficial to the people, any work is glorious, should be done, and is contributing to the world revolution. In the operating room, I hand the surgeon knives and scissors; in the treatment room, I give injections and change dressings for patients; in the registration room, I fill out forms and register for comrades; in the ward, I take the pain of my class brothers as my own pain and their joy as my own joy. I do these ordinary tasks with sincere class feelings. Once, I was taking care of a few critically ill patients with high fevers when I heard that my child had broken an arm. Comrades urged me to go see him quickly, but I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Comrade White sought nothing for himself and dedicated himself entirely to others. This spirit is shown in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every communist must learn from him." I insisted on guarding these critically ill comrades all night. The next day, I escorted them to a large hospital before I could put my mind at ease.

We communists have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes, dedicating ourselves to the public and to the revolution. Those who have complaints after doing ordinary work for seven or eight years are only "getting up at five in the morning for a little gain," people with heavy personal interests, who cannot be diligent in doing ordinary work, let alone serve the people wholeheartedly. We communists must be the people's servants for life, fighting on ordinary posts for life. Where the revolution needs us, we will fight there. Where the revolution needs us to fight for life, we will fight there for life, making Chairman Mao feel at ease and giving Chairman Mao face.

The lies of Khrushchev of China have been exposed, and we must wield the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to sweep his revisionist trash into the garbage heap of history!

    共产党员一心为公
    总后勤部某部护士　李桂顺
    中国赫鲁晓夫散布什么：在“平凡工作中”“成了英雄”，等等。他要革命者为了当“英雄”才去干平凡工作，否则，万万干不得。在他眼中平凡工作是当“英雄”的敲门砖，是争“英雄”桂冠的手段。真是反动透顶！
    毛主席教导我们，要“全心全意地为人民服务”，“毫不利己专门利人”。我们共产党员最听毛主席的话，坚定不移地走毛主席指引的路。我当护士整整二十年了，从没有想过个人成“英雄”。我认识到为人民服务就是共产党员的唯一志愿和终身战斗任务，只要有利于人民，做什么工作都光荣，都应该，都是在为世界革命做着贡献。手术室里，我给医师递刀送剪；治疗室里，我给病员打针换药；挂号室里，我给同志们填表挂号；病房里，我把阶级兄弟的痛苦当做自己的痛苦，把他们的愉快当作自己的愉快。这些平凡的工作，我满怀真挚的阶级感情去做。有一次，我正在护理几个发高烧的重病号，忽然听说我的孩子摔断了胳臂，同志们要我快去看看，但我想到毛主席的教导：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”坚持整夜都守护在这些重病同志的旁边。第二天又护送他们转到大医院，我才把心放下来。
    我们共产党员心最红，眼最亮，一心为公，一心为革命。那种“干七八年”平凡工作就有意见的人，不过是“为了三分利才起早五更”，带着重重私心的人，谈不上兢兢业业地干平凡工作，更谈不上全心全意为人民服务。我们共产党员一定要一辈子都做人民的勤务员，一辈子战斗在平凡岗位上。革命需要我到那里，我就战斗在那里。革命需要我在那里干一辈子，我就在那里一辈子让毛主席放心，给毛主席争气。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的鬼话破产了，我们要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把他的修正主义黑货扫进历史的垃圾堆！
