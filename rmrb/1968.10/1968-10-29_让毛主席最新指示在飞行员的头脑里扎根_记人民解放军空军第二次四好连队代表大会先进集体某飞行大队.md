The flying brigade where the "Heroic Aviation Regiment" of the People's Liberation Army Air Force is located is a combat collective that has been rated as an excellent brigade for seven consecutive years. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they shot down and damaged three American imperialist planes, with 20% of the personnel receiving commendations. Their fundamental experience is to conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions take root in the minds of the pilots.

Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions Must Be Both Spectacular and Solid

This brigade closely follows and implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, both spectacularly and solidly. In this brigade, the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the battle command. On June 2 of this year, the newspaper published Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." That day was a Sunday. Political Commissar Sun Yukun, upon hearing the broadcast of Chairman Mao's latest instruction at home, immediately wrote it down word for word and called the brigade to inform them. Meanwhile, the duty officer had also recorded Chairman Mao's latest instruction and immediately ran to convey it to the pilots. He ran to the second squadron, where the pilots were intently writing on the Chairman Mao Quotations board; he ran to the first squadron, where some pilots had already started studying. At the same time, the entire brigade, from the leading cadres to the pilots, all spontaneously copied, memorized, and discussed Chairman Mao's latest instruction, launching a spectacular campaign to study and propagate Chairman Mao's latest instruction.

After spectacularly propagating Chairman Mao's latest instruction, the Party branch immediately went deep into the masses, carrying out ideological mobilization work to implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction for every individual, guiding everyone to turn the high revolutionary enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's latest instruction into action. They understood the active thoughts in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction, discovering that some comrades thought that as a unit on combat duty, as long as they fought well, they were protecting the interests of the broad masses of the people; in peacetime, they had little contact with the masses, so how could they embody protecting the people? The Party branch, in response to this active thought, organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teachings on trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and protecting the masses, using Chairman Mao's latest instruction as a weapon to severely criticize the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in hating and suppressing the masses. Through study, everyone came to realize that whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the dividing line between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship. As the pillar of proletarian dictatorship, the People's Liberation Army must turn Chairman Mao's latest instruction into their soul, so as to never change and never lose their way.

On the basis of raising awareness, everyone examined their attitude towards the masses in light of Chairman Mao's latest instruction, resolving to always remember to serve the broad masses of the people and always remember to protect the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people. The Party branch also, in response to the pilots' infrequent contact with the masses, which could easily lead to alienation from the masses, immediately formulated measures to strengthen ties with the production teams they were linked to, with pilots regularly participating in labor. In the countryside, they learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants' deep proletarian feelings of loving Chairman Mao, recalling bitterness and sweetness together, never forgetting class bitterness, and never forgetting the poor and lower-middle peasants. Through learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, they further strengthened the military-civilian relationship and promoted ideological revolutionization. Everyone deeply realized that only by closely connecting with the masses and having a heart-to-heart relationship with them could they always remember the fundamental interests of the masses in peacetime and be willing to give everything to protect the people in wartime.

Soon, the brigade conducted an initial evaluation for the Four Good Units. The Party branch again took the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instruction as the content of the evaluation, further checking the implementation situation, raising awareness, and exchanging experiences. Through the initial evaluation, everyone further realized that arming the broad masses of the people with Mao Zedong Thought and making the masses fight against the enemy better is the greatest protection for the revolutionary masses. They immediately organized a small group to guide the study of Chairman Mao's works, helping this production team to set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Every night, they went to every household to guide the poor and lower-middle peasants in studying Chairman Mao's latest instruction and Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought brought about a profound change in the ideological appearance of the poor and lower-middle peasants in this production team, achieving a double harvest in revolution and production. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised, "The People's Liberation Army is truly a model in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Whether you are flying in the sky or stationed on the ground, you are always in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants, always thinking about protecting the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants!"

Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions Must Spark a Revolution in the Depths of the Soul

This brigade, in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, pays attention to guiding and inspiring the pilots to touch their souls, sparking a revolution in the depths of their souls, and ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions take root in the minds of every pilot.

A deputy brigade commander in this brigade, through three instances of self-criticism and rectification in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," set an example for the entire brigade.

At the beginning, when he studied Chairman Mao's latest instruction, he did not fully recognize the influence of the bourgeois military viewpoint in his mind, thinking that his good background and years of party education had solved the problem of emphasizing proletarian politics. The brigade's in-depth criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's promotion of the bourgeois military line touched his soul, and he examined his own single-minded military viewpoint of considering technical improvement more and ideological revolutionization less. He realized that to grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, one must first grasp revolution and establish the idea of putting revolution in the foremost position in all work.

The second time he studied and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instruction, he severely fought against his own negligence in preparedness. Originally, in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction, he feared criticism for not emphasizing proletarian politics and fell into another extreme, simply not engaging in preparedness training. Through studying the "Old Five Articles" and Comrade Lin Biao's instruction on emphasizing proletarian politics, he realized that this was also a wrong thought. He deeply felt that having personal interests could not firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and only by eliminating personal interests could one correctly understand and firmly execute Chairman Mao's proletarian military line.

The third time he studied and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instruction, he realized that grasping revolution meant arming the mind with Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, establishing the idea of fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and sacrificing for it. In a dogfight, he pursued the enemy plane, with an infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, displaying the spirit of "bayonets meeting," shooting at point-blank range, and not flinching even as his plane was about to collide with the enemy plane. He steadfastly fought for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, unblinking, unyielding, and unshaken, shooting until the enemy plane exploded in mid-air, and his plane flew through the debris.

The deputy brigade commander's example of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and severely touching his soul greatly inspired the Party branch. The Party branch called on all comrades to follow the deputy brigade commander's example, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, spark a revolution in the depths of their souls, and ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions take root in the minds of every comrade. Bo Dongxiahai, known as the "Fearless Sky Hunter," further studied and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness." Following the deputy brigade commander's example, he thoroughly searched his mind for the "self" character, discovering that there was still a bit of desire for fame in his courageous and fearless belief. He further severely fought against this "self" character, saying, "Only by completely eliminating the 'self' character and doing a good job in self-revolution can one become a vanguard fighter of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship and truly fight to defend Chairman Mao."

Through sparking a revolution in the depths of their souls, the pilots excitedly said, "Implementing each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is like engaging in a bayonet fight with the 'self' character in our minds. Only by eliminating the 'self' character can Chairman Mao's latest instructions become our soul."

The Most Fundamental Thing in Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions Is to Raise Awareness of the Two-Line Struggle

This brigade, in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, does not merely solve some current active thoughts and complete specific work tasks, but further emphasizes grasping the fundamentals and focusing on solving the problem of which road the brigade will take and which line it will adhere to.

After Chairman Mao issued the instruction: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also constantly raise its political awareness in the struggle," this brigade was preparing to carry out a preparedness flight mission. They heard the broadcast and immediately put learning and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction in the foremost position, launching a campaign to learn from the working class. Everyone linked it to reality, seriously studying the selfless and noble qualities of the working class, learning the revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline of the working class, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of the brigade.

The Party branch believed that each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is an important component of Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principle of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions requires a deep understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to raise awareness of the two-line struggle and promote ideological revolutionization. To fully understand the profound significance of Chairman Mao's latest instruction on the working class being the leading class, after completing the preparedness flight mission and arriving at a new location, they immediately conducted in-depth study, organizing everyone to praise and extol Chairman Mao's consistent emphasis on the leading role of the working class in the revolution, severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's consistent defamation of the working class and suppression of the workers' movement. They also linked it to the working class taking the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in all fields of the superstructure, repeatedly studying and deeply understanding the great practical significance and profound significance of Chairman Mao's latest instruction, realizing that supporting or not supporting, accepting or not accepting the working class's leadership in all fields of the superstructure is the question of whether to execute or not execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, whether to have or not have proletarian dictatorship, and whether to carry the revolution through to the end. Everyone said, "Whoever supports and accepts the working class's leadership, we are with them! Whoever opposes and resists the working class's leadership, we will fight them!" "Forever accept the working class's leadership and be the working class's strong backbone!"

After Chairman Mao's latest instruction on the broad cadres going down to labor was issued, they immediately organized everyone to study it and conduct two-line education, making everyone realize that Chairman Mao's latest instruction pointed out the way for us to ensure that the party does not change its nature, the country does not change its color, and people do not become revisionists. The pilots raised their awareness of the two-line struggle and quickly launched a high tide of participating in production labor. Everyone labored while criticizing China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's plot to make the pilots detach from labor, pursue special privileges, and walk the revisionist road. Everyone felt in labor that participating in labor was not just about digging a shovel of dirt or picking a basket of manure, but a major task of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, uprooting the roots of revisionism.

This brigade conscientiously implements each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, raising the pilots' awareness of the two-line struggle, and elevating the movement to create Four Good Units to a new level. The pilots deeply felt, "Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the direction and soul of our military construction. Step by step, following and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, raising awareness of the two-line struggle, we can always advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and we can create an even more steadfast Four Good Flying Brigade that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

    让毛主席最新指示在飞行员的头脑里扎根
    ——记人民解放军空军第二次四好连队代表大会先进集体某飞行大队
    人民解放军空军“航空兵英雄中队”所在的飞行大队，是一个连续七年被评为四好飞行大队的战斗集体。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们击落击伤美帝国主义强盗飞机三架，百分之二十的人员荣立战功。他们最根本的经验就是，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，让毛主席最新指示在飞行员的头脑里扎根。
    落实毛主席的最新指示既要轰轰烈烈又要扎扎实实
    这个大队对毛主席的最新指示跟得紧，落实好，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。在这个大队，毛主席最新指示的发表，就是战斗的号令。今年六月二日，报纸上发表了毛主席的“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别”的最新指示。这天正是星期日，政委孙玉坤在家里一听到广播毛主席最新指示，就立即一字一句地记下来，打电话通知大队。同时，大队值班参谋也已把毛主席的最新指示记录下来，立即跑去向飞行员们传达。他跑到二中队，飞行员正聚精会神地往毛主席语录板上写；跑到一中队，有的飞行员已经学起来了。在同一时间里，全大队从领导干部到飞行员，人人自动抄写、背诵，进行座谈讨论，掀起了轰轰烈烈的学习、宣传毛主席最新指示的活动。
    他们在轰轰烈烈地宣传了毛主席这一最新指示后，支委立即深入群众，把落实毛主席最新指示的思想发动工作，做到每一个人身上，引导大家把学习毛主席最新指示的高度革命热情落实到行动上。他们了解落实毛主席这一最新指示中的活思想，发现有的同志认为自己是担任战斗值班任务的部队，只要打好仗就是保护广大人民群众的利益；平时在机场和群众接触少，怎样体现保护群众？支部针对这个活思想，组织大家反复学习毛主席关于相信群众、依靠群众、保护群众的伟大教导，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫仇视群众、镇压群众的滔天罪行。通过学习，使大家认识到，对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是区别无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的分水岭，作为无产阶级专政坚强柱石的人民解放军，必须把毛主席的这一最新指示化为自己的灵魂，才能永不变质，永不迷航。
    在提高认识的基础上，大家对照毛主席的最新指示，检查了对人民群众的态度，决心做到时刻不忘为广大人民群众服务，时刻不忘保护广大人民群众的根本利益。党支部还针对飞行员和群众接触少，容易产生脱离群众的情况，立即制定措施，加强和原挂钩生产队的联系，飞行员定期参加劳动。在农村，他们学习贫下中农无限热爱毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，和贫下中农一起忆苦思甜，永远不忘阶级苦，永远不忘贫下中农。通过向贫下中农学习，进一步密切了军民关系，促进了思想革命化。大家深刻地认识到：只有密切联系群众，和群众心连心，在平时才能时刻不忘群众的根本利益，在战时才能为保护人民群众献出自己的一切。
    不久，大队进行四好初评。党支部又把落实毛主席这条最新指示作为评比的内容，进一步检查落实的情况，提高认识，交流经验。通过初评，大家进一步认识到，用毛泽东思想武装广大人民群众的头脑，使群众把对敌斗争搞得更好，这是对革命群众的最大保护。他们又立即组织了一个辅导学习毛主席著作的小组，帮助这个生产队办起了毛泽东思想学习班。他们每天晚上深入每家每户辅导贫下中农学习毛主席最新指示和毛主席著作。毛泽东思想使这个生产队贫下中农的思想面貌发生了深刻变化，革命、生产获得了双丰收。贫下中农称赞说：“解放军真不愧是落实毛主席最新指示的模范，你们不管飞在天上，还是驻在地上，都和贫下中农心连心，时刻想着保护贫下中农的利益！”
    落实毛主席的最新指示  要在灵魂深处爆发革命
    这个大队落实毛主席最新指示，注意引导和启发飞行员触及自己的灵魂，从灵魂深处爆发革命，使毛主席最新指示在每个飞行员的头脑里扎根。
    这个大队的一个副大队长学习、落实毛主席关于抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备的最新指示，三次斗私批修、狠触灵魂的事迹，为全大队树立了榜样。
    开始，他学习毛主席这条最新指示时，对资产阶级单纯军事观点在自己头脑里的影响认识不足，觉得自己出身好，经过党多年教育，突出无产阶级政治没有问题了。大队深入批判反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线，触及了他的灵魂，他检查了自己考虑提高技术多、考虑促进思想革命化少的单纯军事观点，认识到抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，首先要抓革命，树立把革命摆在一切工作首位的思想。
    他第二次学习、落实毛主席这条最新指示时，狠斗了自己放松战备的私心。原来他在落实毛主席这条最新指示中，怕别人批评自己不突出无产阶级政治，又走上了另一个极端，干脆不抓战备训练了。通过学习“老五篇”和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示，使他认识到这同样是一种错误思想。他深刻地体会到，有私心就不能坚决贯彻落实毛主席的最新指示，只有斗掉私心，才能正确理解和坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级建军路线。
    他第三次学习、落实毛主席这条最新指示，认识到抓革命，就是要用毛主席一系列最新指示武装头脑，树立生为毛主席革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席革命路线而献身的思想。在一次空战中，他揪住敌机，怀着无限忠于毛主席的红心，发扬了刺刀见红的精神，抵近敌机脑门上打，眼看自己的飞机就要和敌机相撞，但他一心为忠于毛主席革命路线而战斗，眼不眨，手不软，心不慌，射击距离一直打到零，打得敌机凌空爆炸，他驾驶的飞机从敌机爆炸的碎片中飞驰而过。
    副大队长落实毛主席最新指示、狠触灵魂的事迹，给了党支部极大的启发。支部号召全体同志以副大队长为榜样，落实毛主席最新指示，在灵魂深处爆发革命，使毛主席的最新指示在每个同志的头脑里扎根。被誉为“无畏的高空猎手”的一中队长董小海，他在进一步学习落实毛主席关于抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备的最新指示的时候，以副大队长为榜样，彻底搜索自己头脑中的“私”字，发现自己勇敢不怕死的信念中还有一点想出名的私心，他进一步狠斗了这个“私”字。他说：“只有完全彻底斗掉‘私’字，搞好自我革命，才能做一个无产阶级专政下继续革命的先锋战士，真正为保卫毛主席而战斗。”
    通过在灵魂深处爆发革命，飞行员们激动地说：“落实毛主席的一条最新指示，都要和我们头脑里的‘私’字拚一场刺刀。只有斗掉了‘私’字，才能把毛主席的最新指示化为自己的灵魂。”
    落实毛主席的最新指示最根本的是要提高两条路线斗争觉悟
    这个大队贯彻落实毛主席的最新指示，不满足于解决当前的一些活思想，完成某项具体工作任务，还进一步强调狠抓根本，着重解决大队走什么道路，坚持什么路线的问题。
    毛主席发出“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的最新指示以后，这个大队正准备执行一次战备飞行任务。他们听到广播闻风而动，把学习、落实毛主席这一最新指示放在一切工作的首位，立即掀起了向工人阶级学习的热潮。大家联系实际，认真学习工人阶级大公无私的高贵品质，学习工人阶级的革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，促进了大队思想革命化建设。
    党支部认为，毛主席的每条最新指示，都是毛主席的无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策的重要组成部分，落实毛主席的最新指示，要深刻理解毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，才能提高两条路线斗争觉悟，促进思想革命化。为了充分认识毛主席关于工人阶级是领导阶级的最新指示的深远意义，他们完成战备飞行任务到达新的地点后，又立即进行深入学习，组织大家大赞大颂毛主席一贯强调工人阶级在革命中的领导作用的伟大思想，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫一贯丑化工人阶级、镇压工人运动的滔天罪行。他们还联系工人阶级登上上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台，反复学习、深刻领会毛主席这一最新指示的伟大的现实意义和深远的意义，认识到拥护不拥护、接受不接受工人阶级对上层建筑一切领域的领导，是执行不执行毛主席的革命路线，要不要无产阶级专政，能不能将革命进行到底的大问题。大家说：“谁拥护和接受工人阶级的领导，我们就和谁亲！谁反对和抵制工人阶级的领导，我们就和谁拚！”“永远接受工人阶级的领导，誓做工人阶级的坚强后盾！”
    毛主席关于广大干部下放劳动的最新指示发表以后，他们立即组织大家学习，并进行两条路线教育，使大家认识到，毛主席的这条最新指示，为我们指出了保证党不变质，国不变色，人不变修的途径。飞行员们提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，迅速掀起了参加生产劳动的高潮。大家一边劳动，一边批判中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿阴谋使飞行员脱离劳动，搞特殊化，走向修正主义道路的滔天罪行。大家在劳动中体会到：参加劳动，绝不是挖一锨土，捡一筐粪的事，而是反修、防修，挖掉修正主义根子的大事。
    这个大队认真落实毛主席每一条最新指示，提高飞行员们的两条路线斗争觉悟，使创造四好连队的运动提高到新的水平。飞行员们深有体会地说：“毛主席的最新指示是我军建设的方向和灵魂。步步紧跟、条条落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，提高两条路线斗争觉悟，就能使我们永远沿着毛主席指引的方向前进，就能创造出无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的更加过硬的四好飞行大队。”
