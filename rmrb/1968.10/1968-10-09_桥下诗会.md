Title: Poetry Under the Bridge

	At the poetry gathering, a precious portrait,
	Chairman Mao stands on the boat;
	A poem "Swimming" across ten thousand waves,
	The heart surges with a red tide!

	We will never forget the year 1965,
	Chairman Mao came to the bridge in Wuhan,
	Shaking hands with us warmly,
	Leading us to cross the Yangtze River.

	Today, we have built the Nanjing Bridge,
	But the journey of ten thousand miles is still long;
	Chairman Mao waves his hand, urging us forward,
	Everywhere is a battlefield!

	As the sluice gate opens, a tide of poems surges,
	Ten thousand lines of praise fly towards the Party,
	Tonight—written on paper,
	Tomorrow—built over the river!

    桥下诗会
    诗会上一幅宝像，
    毛主席站在游艇上；
    一首《游泳》万里浪，
    心上红潮猛上涨！
    忘不了一九六五年，
    毛主席来到武汉桥上，
    和我们亲切握手，
    领我们横渡长江。
    今天，我们架起南京桥，
    可是，万里征程路还长；
    毛主席挥手我前进，
    天堑处处是战场！……
    闸门一开诗潮涌，
    万行颂诗飞向党，
    今夜——写在纸上，
    明朝——架在江上！
