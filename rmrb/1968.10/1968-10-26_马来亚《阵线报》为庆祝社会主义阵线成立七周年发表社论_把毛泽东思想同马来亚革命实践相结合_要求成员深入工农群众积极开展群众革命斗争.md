The Malayan Frontline News, the official newspaper of the Malayan Socialist Front, recently published an editorial to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the Socialist Front. The editorial states: "We must integrate Mao Zedong Thought with the revolutionary practice of Malaya, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolutionary practice of Malaya."

The editorial points out: Today, we are in an era where imperialism is heading towards total collapse, socialism is advancing towards global victory, and it is the era of proletarian revolution, an era under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made the entire country red, approaching total victory. The counter-revolutionary nature of the Soviet revisionist clique has been fully exposed. The Soviet revisionist clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia reflects the complete failure of Soviet modern revisionism. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," the people of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have launched armed struggles, making the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries of various countries frantic.

The editorial says: "The national liberation revolutionary movement in Malaya is part of the global revolutionary struggle. The armed struggle in Malaya is unstoppable and continues to develop, shaking the foundations of the rule of U.S. and British imperialism and their puppet regimes of Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew."

The editorial says that to accelerate the victory of the Malayan national liberation struggle, it is necessary to resolutely learn and implement Mao Zedong Thought. It is necessary to continue to thoroughly expose the neo-colonial product "Malaysia" and the new colonial state "Republic of Singapore," exposing the anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people counter-revolutionary policies of U.S. and British imperialism and their puppet regimes of Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew. It is necessary to educate the masses to recognize that the masses are the "true iron wall," the "creative force of world history," while the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are all paper tigers. This will enable the masses to see that as long as they rely on their own strength, they will certainly achieve national liberation, thereby giving the masses confidence and courage to bravely and fiercely rebel against the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and against the old society.

The editorial calls on the party members to go among the masses, especially to go deep into the workers and peasants, to unite with the masses, to overcome the numerous obstacles and difficulties on the road ahead, to actively carry out mass revolutionary struggles, and to strive forward for the complete victory of the Malayan national liberation revolutionary movement.

    马来亚《阵线报》为庆祝社会主义阵线成立七周年发表社论
    把毛泽东思想同马来亚革命实践相结合
    要求成员深入工农群众积极开展群众革命斗争
    新华社二十五日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚政党马来亚社会主义阵线机关报《阵线报》最近为庆祝社会主义阵线成立七周年发表社论说：“我们要把毛泽东思想同马来亚的革命实践相结合，以毛泽东思想来指导马来亚的革命实践。”
    社论指出：今天，我们所处的时代是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，是无产阶级革命的时代，是以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的时代。中国无产阶级文化大革命已经使社会主义中国实现全国山河一片红，到了接近全面胜利的阶段。苏修叛徒集团的反革命面目，已经彻底暴露。苏修叛徒集团武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克，反映了苏联现代修正主义的总破产。在毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想指引下，亚非拉许多国家的人民开展了武装斗争，打得美帝国主义及各国反动派焦头烂额。
    社论说：“马来亚的民族解放革命运动，是整个世界革命斗争的一部分，马来亚的武装斗争，其势不可挡，不断向前发展，震撼了美、英帝国主义及其拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡政权的统治根基。”
    社论说，为加速取得马来亚民族解放斗争的胜利，必须坚决学习、贯彻毛泽东思想。要继续彻底揭露新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”和新型殖民地“新加坡共和国”，揭露美、英帝国主义及其拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡政权的反共、反华、反人民的反革命政策。要教育群众认识群众是“真正的铜墙铁壁”，是“创造世界历史的动力”，而帝修反统统是纸老虎，使群众看清只要依靠人民群众自己的力量，就必然会取得民族解放，从而使群众有信心，有勇气，敢于迅猛地、激烈地造帝修反的反，造旧社会的反。
    社论要求这个党的成员到群众中去，特别要深入到工农群众中去，和群众打成一片，克服在前进道路上的重重障碍和困难，积极开展群众革命斗争，为争取马来亚民族解放革命运动的彻底胜利奋勇前进。
