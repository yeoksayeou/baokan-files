Xiao Chen and Xiao Wu returned to their school after being away for three months. The entire school had undergone a transformation. Classmates, including those who previously held different views, all came to warmly welcome them. Where did this change come from? Classmates said:

We must thank the working class for their re-education.

Xiao Chen and Xiao Wu, students of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Beijing Petroleum Institute, returned to school from Shanghai. When they stepped into the campus they had not seen for three months, they were greeted by a completely new scene: Chairman Mao's portrait shone brightly, language quotations lined both sides of the road, columns for struggle, criticism, and transformation were everywhere, and the slogans of "Three Loyalties" were plastered on the walls. Xiao Chen and Xiao Wu looked at all this and were moved to exclaim in unison: The working class has entered the school, and the school has undergone a complete transformation.

They hurried to the classroom door and saw their former opponents. Out of habit, they lowered their heads and entered. However, at this moment, classmates, including those who had previously held opposing views, immediately gathered around them. Some busied themselves bringing water and food, while others took their backpacks and escorted them all the way to the dormitory, making their beds. All this surprised and moved Xiao Chen and Xiao Wu. They excitedly said, "Thank you, classmates!" "No!" The classmates, in unison, shifted their gaze to a female worker sitting beside them and said, "We should thank Comrade Tang, we should thank the working class for their re-education!"

Comrade Tang is named Tang Xin Yuan, a worker from Mochengjian Coal Mine. After she came to this class, she learned that Xiao Chen and Xiao Wu had been away from school for more than three months. She thought that now the school was carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and all classmates should return. So, she organized the classmates to write letters, urging them to return to school quickly. At the same time, she led the classmates to study Chairman Mao's teachings on how to correctly handle comrades with different views. Comrade Tang earnestly told the classmates, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Unite all the people who can be united with.' We must implement what Marx said: 'The proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all mankind.' Liberating all mankind is the common goal of our proletarian revolution. If we do not pay attention to overcoming sectarianism, individualism, and other issues, and do not establish a broad-mindedness to liberate all mankind, we will not only fail to liberate ourselves but also deviate from the interests of the broad masses of laboring people. If we do not know how to unite all the people who can be united with, we will not be able to effectively strike at a handful of class enemies."

Comrade Tang's words deeply moved every classmate's heart. The classmates saw the working class's boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, saw the working class's broad-mindedness, and immediately the classroom resonated with the slogans, "Learn from the working class's good example, be a vanguard in the struggle, criticism, and transformation." At this moment, even those classmates who had previously held a cold attitude towards Xiao Chen and Xiao Wu, also fought against their selfishness on the spot, determined to overcome bourgeois factionalism, and warmly welcomed Xiao Chen and Xiao Wu back to school.

专栏：

    小陈和小吴回到离别三个月的学校，全校一片新貌。同学们，包括过去持不同观点的同学，也都来热情欢迎。这个变化从何而来呢？同学们说：
    要感谢工人阶级对我们的再教育
    北京石油学院机械系的同学小陈和小吴，从上海回学校来了。
    当他们踏进离别三个月的校园时，眼前呈现的是一片新貌：毛主席画像放红光，语录牌林立路两旁，斗批改专栏连成片，“三忠于”标语贴满墙……。小陈和小吴望着这一切，激动得心里迸发出同一个声音：工人阶级进学校，学校处处换新貌。
    他俩匆忙地走到教室门外，一眼看到原来和自己对立的同学，他们习惯地把头一低，推门进去了。可是，这时同学们，包括过去和他们持对立观点的同学都立刻簇拥过来，有的忙着端水送饭，有的接过背包，一直送到宿舍，铺好床铺。这一切使小陈和小吴感到十分惊奇，也十分感动。他们激动地说：“谢谢同学们！”“不！”同学们不约而同地把目光转移到坐在他们身边的一位女工说：“应该感谢汤师傅，感谢工人阶级对我们的再教育！”
    汤师傅叫汤辛元，是木城涧煤矿的工人。她来到这个班以后，了解到小陈和小吴回家三个多月没有归校。她想，现在学校里搞斗批改，应该所有同学都回来，于是，她就让班里同学写信，叫他俩快点归校。同时组织同学们学习毛主席有关正确对待持有不同意见同志的教导。汤师傅语重心长地对同学们说，毛主席教导我们：
  “团结一切可以团结的广大群众”，必须实行马克思所说的“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。”解放全人类，这是我们无产阶级革命的共同目标。如果不注意克服小团体主义、个人主义等，不树立起解放全人类的胸怀，就不仅不能解放自己，还会背离广大劳动人民的利益。如果不善于团结一切可以团结的群众，也就不能有效地打击一小撮阶级敌人。汤师傅的话深深打动了每个同学的心弦。同学们看到了工人阶级无限忠于毛主席的红心，看到了工人阶级宽广的胸怀，顿时，课堂里响起一阵阵“学习工人好榜样，斗、批、改中当闯将”的口号。这时，连那些原来对小陈和小吴抱冷淡态度的一些同学，也当场斗了私心，决心克服资产阶级派性，热情欢迎小陈和小吴回校。　长缨　柯辉　肖流
