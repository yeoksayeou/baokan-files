Wei Mingkang of Wansheng Production Brigade, Erdaqi, Weidong Commune says:

The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University style school is most to our liking.

We must criticize the old educational system and praise the new educational system.

Our commune's primary school established an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University style junior middle school class according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The students "study as the main task, also learn other things, that is, not only study literature but also industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie." After these students graduate, they will be both literate and skilled, which is most to our liking as poor and lower-middle peasants.

The junior middle school class showed good signs as soon as it was established. The school lacked classrooms, but they did not ask the state for help. The teachers and students built the classrooms themselves, and various production brigades came to support them, sending some stone masons and carpenters as technical guides. In this way, in just over fifty days and without spending a single cent of the state's money, they built three new classrooms. Before the school even started classes, they had trained a batch of stone masons, carpenters, and bricklayers. Most of the students learned how to make bricks, and more than ten students learned how to cut wood.

In the past, when establishing middle schools, they did not consider us poor and lower-middle peasants, and they all established them in the county and district seats. The students were far from home and had to live in the school. Even with the least amount of board and lodging fees and pocket money, it would still cost more than a hundred yuan a year. We poor and lower-middle peasants generally could not afford it. Our commune's primary school established a junior middle school class, and the students could study nearby and eat at home. After school, they could go home and do some farm work. In addition, on Saturdays and Sundays, they could work in the brigade. The work points they earned in a year were enough for their food and use, so they did not need their families to bear the burden, nor did they need to apply for scholarships. Calculating this, the state would save a large amount of money for establishing middle schools every year. Saving money is a small matter, but more importantly, such a school trains students who do not leave the masses, do not leave labor, and do not leave the class struggle in the countryside. They are truly our successors.

    卫东公社二大队万年生产队　魏明康说：
    抗大式的学校最合我们的心意
    对旧教育制度就是要批判，对新教育制度就是要称赞。
    我们公社完小按照毛主席的指示办了一个抗大式的初中班，学生“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。”这些学生学出来后，能文能武，最合我们贫下中农的心意。
    初中班刚开办就看出好苗头。学校校舍少，他们不向国家伸手，老师和学生自己动手修建，各大队都来支援，还派了些石工、木工当技术指导。就这样只花五十多天时间，没用国家一分钱，就盖起了三间新教室。学校还没有开课，就培养了一批石匠、木匠和泥匠，大部分学生学会了做泥砖，十几个学生懂得了解木料。
    过去办中学，不为我们贫下中农着想，都办在县城和区上，学生离家远，要住校，一年伙食费加零用钱，再少也得一两百元，我们贫下中农一般都上不起。我们公社完小办了初中班，学生就近入学，在家吃饭，放学回家还赶上干一歇活路，加上星期天、星期六在队里劳动，一年得到的工分够他吃用，不用再要家庭负担，也不需要申请助学金。这笔账算一下，国家每年要节约好大一笔办中学的钱。节省钱还是小事，更重要的是，这样的学校培养出来的学生，一不脱离群众，二不脱离劳动，三不脱离农村的阶级斗争，才真正是我们的接班人。
