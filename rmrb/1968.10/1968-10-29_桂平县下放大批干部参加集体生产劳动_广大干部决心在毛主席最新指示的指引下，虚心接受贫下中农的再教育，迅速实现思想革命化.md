Guangxi Guiping County Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's directive that "the system of cadres participating in collective production labor must be adhered to," has since August this year sent down a large number of cadres to participate in collective production labor. This has effectively promoted the revolutionization of the organs and the thought revolutionization of the cadres.

To organize the cadres of the organs to go down to the countryside to labor, the Guiping County Revolutionary Committee set up a farm in Baisha Commune. The county Revolutionary Committee decided that, in addition to cadres who are permanently sent down to labor, the staff of the county Revolutionary Committee organs will also be sent down to labor in batches. One-fourth of the staff will go to the countryside to propagate Mao Zedong Thought while living and laboring in the production teams, one-fourth will go to the farm to participate in labor, and the rest will stay in the organs to carry out daily work and participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Following the example of the county-level organs, all communes (towns) in the county have also taken action, organizing cadres to go down to the farms, forestry stations, water conservancy projects to participate in collective production labor or to live and labor in the production teams.

In the process of being sent down to labor, the broad masses of cadres in Guiping County have received re-education from the workers and peasants, seriously remolded their world outlook, and their spiritual face has undergone great changes. The original county Party Committee's Financial and Commercial Political Department director, now a standing committee member of the county Revolutionary Committee, Ni Songbo, who used to be a shoemaker before liberation, said with deep feelings: "In the past, I came from a very poor family, participated in the revolution for more than twenty years, and thought I was an old cadre. The more I participated in the revolution, the bigger my official airs became, and the farther I was from the masses. This time, participating in labor as an ordinary laborer, together with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, picking up the manure basket to carry fertilizer, picking up the rope to herd cattle, all the airs are gone. In the past, when I actively sought out the masses, they would deliberately avoid me. Now, I don't have to seek them out, and the masses will actively come to me. Sending cadres down to labor is indeed a fundamental measure to prevent and combat revisionism." Yang Yongzhi, deputy director of the Xinmu Commune Revolutionary Committee, said: "In the past, labor was done with an 'official' air, pointing and gesturing. Now, as an ordinary laborer, I honestly accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn anew, and both remold myself and educate the masses." Many cadres who live in the city and are called "three-door" cadres, who in the past did not know the difference between the five grains, had a gap in feelings with the laboring people. After being sent down to labor, they gradually learned the skills of production labor, and their thoughts and feelings also changed.

The cadres at all levels in Guiping County, by going down to labor, not only remolded their subjective world but also promoted their work. The Langtan Seventh Production Team of Xiaowan Brigade, Xiahuan Commune, due to the sabotage and disruption by a handful of class enemies, was relatively backward in both revolution and production. The cadres of the commune Revolutionary Committee went to this production team to live and labor, through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously propagating Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, mobilized the masses to root out the class enemies, and quickly changed the backward face of this team.

After Chairman Mao's latest directives on sending down a large number of cadres to labor were issued, they greatly inspired the broad masses of cadres in Guiping County. They took Chairman Mao's latest directives as their weapon, seriously reviewed and summarized the situation and experience of the cadres going down to labor in the previous stage. In early October, they organized the second batch of cadres to go down to the farms, forestry stations, and water conservancy projects of the county and communes to participate in labor, or to live and labor in the brigades and production teams. The broad masses of cadres sent down throughout the county are determined, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directives, to humbly accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants and further achieve thought revolutionization.

    桂平县下放大批干部参加集体生产劳动
    广大干部决心在毛主席最新指示的指引下，虚心接受贫下中农的再教育，迅速实现思想革命化
    新华社南宁二十八日电　广西桂平县革命委员会遵照毛主席“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度”的教导，从今年八月份以来，下放了大批干部参加集体生产劳动，有力地促进了机关革命化和干部思想革命化。
    为了组织机关干部下放劳动，桂平县革委会在白沙公社办了一所农场。县革委会决定，除长期下放劳动的干部以外，县革委会机关工作人员也分期分批下放劳动，实行四分之一人员下乡边宣传毛泽东思想边蹲点劳动，四分之一人员到农场参加劳动，其余人员留在机关坚持日常工作和参加毛泽东思想学习班。在县级机关干部的带动下，全县各公社（镇）也行动起来，组织干部分别下放到农场、林场、水利工地参加集体生产劳动或到生产队蹲点劳动。
    桂平县广大干部在下放劳动中接受工农群众的再教育，认真改造世界观，精神面貌发生了很大变化。解放前做过皮鞋工人的原县委财贸政治部主任、现任县革委会常委的倪松波深有体会地说：“过去自己出身很穷苦，参加革命二十多年，以为是老干部了，官架子越来越大，同群众的距离越来越远。这次参加劳动，做一个普通劳动者，同广大贫下中农一起，挑起粪箕就去挑肥料，拿起绳索就去放牛，什么架子都打掉了。过去主动找群众，群众都有意避开，现在不用找，群众就自动地来找自己。干部下放劳动真是反修防修的根本措施啊。”新木公社革委会副主任杨用知说：“过去劳动是带着‘官’架子指手划脚，现在以一个普通劳动者参加劳动，老老实实地接受贫下中农的再教育，重新学习，既改造了自己，也教育了群众。”许多家住城市的“三门”干部，过去“五谷不分”，同劳动人民感情格格不入。下放劳动后，他们逐步学会了生产劳动的本领，思想感情也起了变化。
    桂平县各级干部下放劳动，不仅改造了主观世界，同时也推动了工作。下湾公社下火大队浪滩第七生产队，由于一小撮阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，革命和生产都较落后，公社革委会干部到这个生产队蹲点劳动，通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，大力宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，发动起群众揪出了阶级敌人，迅速改变了这个队的落后面貌。
    毛主席关于广大干部下放劳动的最新指示发表后，极大地鼓舞了桂平县广大干部。他们以毛主席的最新指示为武器，认真检查和总结了前一阶段干部下放劳动的情况和经验。十月上旬，又组织第二批干部分别下放到县、社的农场、林场和水利工地参加劳动，或到大队、生产队蹲点劳动。全县广大下放干部决心在毛主席最新指示的指引下，虚心接受贫下中农的再教育，进一步实现思想革命化。
