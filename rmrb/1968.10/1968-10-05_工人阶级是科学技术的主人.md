The successful completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge fully demonstrates that "the masses are the real heroes" and that the working class is the true master of science and technology. It has powerfully refuted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev, greatly boosting the morale of the working class and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. The struggle of our North Shore Base Team in developing prestressed beams using indigenous methods provides a vivid example of this.

The working class has the greatest foresight, is selfless, and most obedient to the commands of the proletarian headquarters. Only under the leadership of the working class can scientific and technological work develop in the correct direction. From the very beginning of the development of prestressed beams, there was a sharp struggle between two lines. The bourgeois technical "authorities," in order to show off, flaunt their wealth, and gain personal fame and status, were willing to spend tens of millions of yuan of state funds to blindly copy foreign materials, build large factories, and set up a so-called "assembly line" for producing prestressed beams. They also insisted on using foreign frameworks, dividing a single beam into three sections for production. We workers saw that they were resisting the Party's policy of self-reliance and frugal construction, and we were very indignant. We adhered to the policy of frugal construction, using the sky as our factory and the earth as our battlefield, and launched the battle to develop prestressed beams using indigenous methods.

"The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." The working class has the most practical experience, is the wisest, and has the greatest talent. Wire tensioning is a key process in the production of prestressed beams, and the accuracy of the tensioning force directly affects the quality of the finished product. During the development process, the phenomenon of wire slippage occurred. The bourgeois technical "authorities" studied and studied, but were at a loss. They then started to retreat, saying nonsense like, "If wire slippage cannot be overcome, the Nanjing Bridge does not necessarily have to use prestressed beams; we can still follow the foreign example and change the type of beam." We workers paid no attention to their nonsense. Everyone followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "correct ideas can only come from social practice, from the three kinds of social practice—production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." We carried out mass experiments, studying various factors of wire slippage, from the steel grade of the anchor to the quenching process and slope details, conducting experiments one by one, and finally overcame the problem of wire slippage. Through dozens of projects and thousands of experiments, we workers finally mastered the rules of producing entire prestressed beams, making the production of prestressed beams reach the world's advanced level. The so-called "assembly line" set up by the bourgeois technical "authorities" did not produce a single beam and was a complete failure.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions are the greatest trust, greatest education, greatest encouragement, and greatest motivation for us, the working class. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fully mobilize our leading role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, and strive to reach the peak of world science and technology.

    工人阶级是科学技术的主人
    南京长江大桥北岸基地队全体工人
    南京长江大桥的胜利建成，充分说明了“群众是真正的英雄”，工人阶级是科学技术的真正主人，有力地粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，大长了我们工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。从我们北岸基地队土法试制预应力梁的斗争过程，就雄辩地证明了这一点。
    工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最听从无产阶级司令部的号令。科学技术工作只有在工人阶级领导下，才能沿着正确的方向发展。试制预应力梁一开始，就存在尖锐的两条路线的斗争。资产阶级技术“权威”，为了摆阔气，讲排场，捞取个人名利地位，不惜花费国家几十万块钱，生搬硬套外国资料，大建厂房，搞了一个所谓生产预应力梁的“流水线”，并且硬套洋框框，把一片梁分三段制造。我们工人看到他们以贪大求洋抵制党的自力更生、勤俭建国的方针，十分气愤。我们坚持勤俭建国的方针，以蓝天为厂房，以大地为战场，摆开了土法试制预应力梁的战斗。
    “卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。工人阶级最有实践经验，最聪明，最有才能。钢丝张拉是制造预应力梁过程中的一个关键，张拉力控制的准确与否，直接影响成品的好坏。在试制过程中，出现了滑丝的现象。资产阶级技术“权威”，研究来研究去，束手无策。于是，他们就打起退堂鼓，胡说什么“滑丝过不了关，南京大桥不一定要用预应力梁，还是仿照外国改变梁的类型。”我们工人根本不理那一套，大家遵循毛主席“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来”的教导，开展群众性的试验，研究滑丝的种种因素，从锚具的钢号、淬火工艺到坡度等细节，逐个进行试验，终于克服了滑丝现象。我们工人经过几十个项目、数千次的试验，终于掌握了整片生产预应力梁的规律，使预应力梁的制造达到了世界先进水平。而资产阶级技术“权威”搞的所谓“流水线”，一片梁也没有生产出来就流产了。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”毛主席的光辉指示，是对我们工人阶级的最大信任，最大教育，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。我们一定遵照毛主席的最新指示，在文化大革命中和一切工作中充分发挥领导作用，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，攀登世界科学技术的高峰。
