Standing on the Yao Mountains looking towards Beijing,
A red sun rises before our eyes,
The Yao people have been liberated,
All thanks to our savior Mao Zedong.

The Little Red Book is close to our hearts,
Chairman Mao's teachings are remembered,
On the path forward, we have a direction,
With boundless strength to move mountains and seas.

The Cultural Revolution's storm and thunder roars,
The East Wind sweeps ten thousand miles, waving red flags,
Following the great commander,
Struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism to achieve new victories.

    毛主席啊，瑶族儿女忠于您
    瑶族　邓友铭
    站在瑶山望北京，
    一轮红日眼前升，
    瑶族人民得解放，
    全靠救星毛泽东。
    红色宝书紧贴胸，
    毛主席教导记心中，
    前进路上有方向，
    排山倒海力无穷。
    文化革命风雷激，
    东风万里舞红旗，
    紧跟伟大统帅走，
    斗私批修立新功。
