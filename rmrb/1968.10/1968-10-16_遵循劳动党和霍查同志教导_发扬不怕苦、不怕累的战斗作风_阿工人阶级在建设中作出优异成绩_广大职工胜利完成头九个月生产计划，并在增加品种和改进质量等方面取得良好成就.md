The heroic Albanian working class, following the guidance of the Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, has emphasized proletarian politics, striven for the ideological transformation of people, and displayed tremendous enthusiasm and energy in socialist construction. They have excellently completed the industrial production plan for the first nine months of this year.

In recent days, from the northern city of Shkodër to the southern coastal city of Sarandë, from the western port of Durrës to the southeastern coal mine of Mborje-Drenovë, news of the completion and overfulfillment of production tasks has been continuously reported. The broad masses of workers, inspired by the resolution of the Albanian People's Assembly to condemn and withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, have even higher political enthusiasm, more vigorous revolutionary spirit, and greater work enthusiasm. They are determined to follow the Party of Labour's guidance, holding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, bravely building and defending the socialist motherland.

In the petroleum industry, statistics show that the production plan for crude oil in the first nine months was completed at 104%, and the production plan for asphalt was completed at 109%. The oil workers in the Fier region overfulfilled the oil production plan by 15.9%. The workers at the Çerrik Oil Refinery had started executing the production tasks for the fourth quarter by mid-September. The entire workforce of the factory is determined to overproduce 25,000 tons of oil this year.

In the chemical industry, the production plan for alkalis in the first nine months has been overfulfilled. The production of phosphate fertilizer completed 109.7% of the plan. The workers at the Laç Fertilizer Plant had already produced more than 7,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer and nearly 9,000 tons of sulfuric acid by the end of September, exceeding the original plan for the first nine months. This has strongly supported industrial and agricultural production.

The workers in the machinery industry have displayed revolutionary enthusiasm, tapped potential, and successfully completed the production plan for the first nine months. The Dajti, Enver, Partizan, and Dajti machine factories in the capital, Tirana, have all overfulfilled the production plan. During the same period, the national plan for the production of small agricultural tools such as picks, hoes, and shovels has also been overfulfilled, timely meeting the needs of various agricultural cooperatives.

The production plan for copper mines in the first nine months was completed at 104.6%, and the production plan for copper wire was completed at 103%. The workers at the Rubik Copper Smeltery have studied the Party of Labour's documents and Comrade Enver Hoxha's works, significantly raising their political and ideological awareness. They have carried forward the fearless and hardworking spirit of the proletariat, fighting in the scorching heat of the smelting furnaces. By the end of September, they had already overfulfilled the production plan for the first nine months by 180 tons. During the same period, the production plan for chrome mines was completed at 102%. The workers at the Martanesh Chrome Mine in the Mat district have launched socialist labor competitions, with high production enthusiasm. By September 24, they had already produced 2,200 tons of chrome ore more than the plan for the first nine months, and the quality has been further improved.

The workers at various cement factories across the country, who are directly responsible for supporting national basic construction, have overfulfilled the production tasks for the first nine months of this year.

The production plan for electricity in the first nine months has also been overfulfilled.

The workers in the light industry sector have also achieved good production results. The production plans for wood, paper, textiles, footwear, and sugar in the first nine months have all been completed and overfulfilled. The workers at the Mao Zedong Textile Combine in Përmet, following the Party of Labour's guidance, have striven for the ideological transformation of people, further promoting production, and supplying more high-quality cloth to the people across the country.

In the first nine months, in addition to completing production tasks, the broad masses of workers in Albania have also achieved good results in building new production lines and workshops, increasing product varieties, reducing production costs, and improving product quality.
