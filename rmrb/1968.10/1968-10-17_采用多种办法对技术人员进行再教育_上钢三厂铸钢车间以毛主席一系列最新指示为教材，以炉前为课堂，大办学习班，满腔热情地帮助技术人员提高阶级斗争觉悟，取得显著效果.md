Following Chairman Mao's instruction that "students from old schools, most or the majority of them, can combine with workers and peasants, some even have inventions and creations, but they need to be re-educated by workers and peasants under the correct leadership, to thoroughly change their old thoughts," the No. 3 Steel Plant's Casting Workshop has adopted various methods to actively re-educate technical personnel, achieving remarkable results.

The workshop has 20 technical staff members, most of whom are university graduates. They have been working for over ten years, with the rest having worked for about three to four years. Due to the poisoning of the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, these graduates from old schools have long been separated from the workers and peasants, differing greatly from the worker masses in both ideology and production knowledge. Some of them only have an office desk, a book on steelmaking, and a slide rule in mind. Others spend their days thinking about becoming engineers or experts, but are often at a loss when it comes to solving practical problems in production. To address this situation, and based on the urgent demands of the broad worker masses and the technical personnel themselves, the workshop organized the technical staff to leave their offices and go to the production front line, helping them to combine with the worker masses through participating in production labor.

After the technical personnel went to the production front line, the workshop revolutionary committee adopted the following effective measures to re-educate them:

Using Chairman Mao's works and his latest series of instructions as teaching materials, and the furnace front as the classroom, the workshop held extensive study sessions to continuously raise the technical personnel's awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle. The workshop often held various forms of criticism meetings. Workers exposed the reactionary bourgeois technical "authorities" and stubborn revisionists in the factory to the furnace front and work teams for struggle sessions. During the criticism meetings, worker comrades studied a quote from Chairman Mao, targeted a counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, and used their personal experiences and ironclad facts to powerfully criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line executed by the factory's revisionists and reactionary technical "authorities." At the same time, they praised the proletarian revolutionary spirit of the worker class under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, daring to think, speak, and act. These living education sessions greatly enhanced the technical personnel's profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao and aroused their intense hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. Some technical staff members who graduated from colleges and universities denounced the harm of the revisionist educational line during the study sessions and deeply felt that only by listening to Chairman Mao and thoroughly reforming their worldviews could they forge themselves into proletarian intellectuals and truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The broad worker masses, especially the veteran workers, acted as teachers to re-educate the technical personnel. After the technical personnel were sent down, the workshop revolutionary committee, in response to some of their "fear of losing face" mentality, divided them into small groups and sent them to the worker masses to listen to the opinions of the veteran workers. The worker comrades said, "You coming down to solve production problems with us is welcome." A female technical staff member went down and learned electrical configuration from an apprentice. She was afraid that others would say, "A university graduate doing the apprentice's job." In fact, the workers did not say that but enthusiastically taught her the production situation and practical operational experience. This female technical staff member had a deep impression. She said, "I originally thought I had knowledge, but once I came into contact with the actual production, I realized I knew nothing."

Some technical personnel had mental barriers about going down to work as workers, saying things like, "Our responsibility as technical personnel is to ensure product quality and research work, which can also be said to be directly participating in production." The veteran workers heard this and said painfully, "In the old society, many university graduates were unemployed after graduation. Today, you eat the people's food but are not even willing to be workers. Is this right to Chairman Mao and to us workers?" The workers' words were heartfelt and made these technical personnel deeply realize that they should go to the workers and get their hands dirty, otherwise, the rust of revisionism in their minds would only grow thicker.

Promoting the advanced elements among the technical personnel to spur the laggards. A technical staff member, after being sent down, worked diligently, actively helped the team leader with the small group's ideological and political work, and was praised by the workshop workers. The small group's workers elected him as a leading cadre of the work team. The workshop revolutionary committee seized this advanced seedling and further encouraged the technical personnel to strive to combine with the worker masses, achieving good results.

Through the sent-down labor, the technical personnel deeply felt that production practice is the best classroom for them to receive re-education, and the worker comrades are the best teachers to thoroughly change their old thoughts. They had a deep realization, saying, "I have studied for more than ten years, changed many teachers, but the true good teacher is still the worker in the factory!"

    采用多种办法对技术人员进行再教育
    上钢三厂铸钢车间以毛主席一系列最新指示为教材，以炉前为课堂，大办学习班，满腔热情地帮助技术人员提高阶级斗争觉悟，取得显著效果
    新华社上海十六日电　遵照毛主席“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想”的教导，上钢三厂铸钢车间采取多种办法，对技术人员积极进行再教育，取得了显著的效果。
    这个车间的技术员共有二十人，绝大部分都是大学毕业生。他们离开学校踏上工作岗位，工龄长的已有十年，其余大部分都在三、四年左右。由于受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒害，这些从旧学校培养的大学生长期脱离工农群众，从思想感情到生产知识，都同工人群众差得很远。他们中的一些人心目中只有一张办公桌、一本《炼钢学》、一把计算尺，还有的人成天考虑如何当工程师、专家，至于生产实践中的问题，他们往往束手无策，解决不了。针对这种情况，并且根据广大工人群众和技术人员本身的迫切要求，车间就组织技术人员走出办公室，把他们下放到生产第一线，帮助他们通过参加生产劳动，走同工人群众相结合的道路。
    技术人员下到生产第一线以后，车间革委会采取以下一些有效办法对他们进行再教育。
    以毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示作教材，以炉前为课堂，大办学习班，不断提高技术人员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。车间里常常有各种形式的批判会。工人们把厂里一些反动的资产阶级技术“权威”以及顽固不化的走资派，揪到炉前和班组进行批斗。在批判会上，工人同志学习一条毛主席语录，针对中国赫鲁晓夫的一个反革命修正主义谬论，以亲身经历和铁的事实，有力地批判了厂内走资派和反动技术“权威”所执行的反革命修正主义路线，同时颂扬了工人阶级在毛主席革命路线指引下，敢想、敢说、敢干的无产阶级革命精神。这些活的教育，极大地增强了技术人员对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，激发起他们对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。有些大中专学校毕业的技术员，在学习班上控诉了修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害，更加深深体会到，只有听毛主席的话，彻底改造自己的世界观，才能把自己锻炼成为一个无产阶级知识分子，真正为工农兵服务。
    由广大工人群众特别是老工人当教员，对技术人员进行再教育。技术人员下放以后，车间革委会针对他们有些人存在的“怕丢面子”的思想，把他们分成小组，下到工人群众中去听取老师傅的意见。工人同志们说：“你们下来和我们一起解决生产问题，我们就是欢迎。”有个女技术员下去后，跟一个艺徒学配电，她就怕别人讲“大学生做艺徒的艺徒”。事实上，工人们并没有这样说，而是很热情地把生产情况和实际操作经验教给她。这个女技术员很有感触。她说：“自己原以为有学问，但一接触生产实际，真是什么都不懂。”
    有的技术人员对下去当工人思想上不通，说什么“我们技术人员的责任是搞好产品质量和研究工作，也可以说是直接参加生产了”。老工人听后痛心地说：“在旧社会，不少大学生毕业即失业，今天你们吃了人民的饭，连工人都不愿意当，这对得起毛主席、对得起我们工人吗？”工人的话，语重心长，使这些技术人员深深感到，应当到工人中间去滚一身油污，否则思想里修正主义的锈垢要越长越厚。
    发扬技术人员中的先进因素，鞭策后进。有个技术员下放后，踏踏实实参加劳动，主动帮助班组长做小组的思想政治工作，得到了车间工人的好评，小组里的工人推选他当了班组的领导骨干。车间革委会抓住这一先进苗子，进一步鼓励技术人员努力和工人群众相结合，收到了很好的效果。
    技术人员通过下放劳动深深体会到，生产实践是自己接受再教育的最好的课堂，工人同志是彻底改变自己旧思想的最好的老师。他们深有体会地说，读了十多年书，换了不少的教师，但是真正的好老师还是工厂里的工人！
