The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Upon hearing this, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants sprang into action. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they lead the schools in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. Recently, the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a symposium in Jianyang County on the issue of how poor and lower-middle peasants should manage schools. The symposium exchanged experiences on how poor and lower-middle peasants lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in rural schools. Below are the speeches of several poor and lower-middle peasants at the symposium.
