The Party is a Tool for Class Struggle

	Captain Dong Xiaohai of the "Heroic Squadron of the Air Force"
	Captain Wang Baojin of a certain maintenance unit
	Captain Men Yuxiang of a certain unit
	Political Instructor Liu Yuegao of a certain unit

	At a time when the entire nation is swept up in the fervor of struggle, criticism, and transformation, our great leader Chairman Mao recently issued an instruction: "A person has arteries and veins, through which blood circulates via the heart, and also needs the lungs to breathe, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without eliminating waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lose its vitality." Chairman Mao's latest instruction is like a beacon, illuminating the path of party rectification and building. This latest instruction is a great development of Marxism-Leninism's theory on party building, and it is the fundamental guarantee for our party to remain forever red. A proletarian political party must continuously expel the old and take in the new, must continuously eliminate waste and absorb fresh blood in the midst of class struggle. Only in this way can the party maintain its advanced and combative nature, becoming a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against class enemies.

	The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocates the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," advocating that "to be a good party member, one must build a good party." He raises the banner of the "good person's party," peddling his black "self-cultivation" and never mentioning which class's party members or which class's party. He attempts to make the proletarian political party disengage from class struggle, change the nature of the party, and turn our great party into a "good person's party," that is, the so-called "people's party," which is a fascist party of the bourgeoisie. This is a major conspiracy by the Chinese Khrushchev to usurp the party, which must be thoroughly exposed.

	Political parties are tools of class struggle and there is no such thing as a classless, super-class "good person's party." What kind of "party members" does the "good person's party" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev want to absorb? Look! He blatantly says things like: "It's fine if there are ten thousand rich peasant party members in the Northeast"; "capitalists joining the party is even better"; using "special methods" to cultivate a batch of bourgeois intellectuals as "successors"; having exploitation is also acceptable for party membership, and so on. Under the manipulation of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, all kinds of "red capitalists" and bourgeois technical "authorities" are dragged into the party. The facts are clear: the "good person's party" that the Chinese Khrushchev attempts to establish is a so-called "people's party" picked from the garbage heap of revisionism, a motley collection of filth and dirt.

	The Chinese Khrushchev dreams day and night of establishing his "good person's party," advocating that "those with surrender and betrayal behavior can also be elected as central committee members." Thus, big and small traitors and spies are protected, and every effort is made to let them occupy key leadership positions. Why does the Chinese Khrushchev show such concern for this small group of traitors, scabs, spies, and counter-revolutionaries? Why does he maliciously slander and attack the revolutionary leadership class of our country, namely the working class, and its most reliable allies, the poor and lower-middle peasants, and other laboring people? Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In this world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." The Chinese Khrushchev is the biggest traitor and the biggest internal spy. The embryonic form of the "good person's party" he organized is a revisionist faction hidden within the Communist Party, his bourgeois command center.

	The Chinese Khrushchev completely negates class struggle, advocating the building of a "good person's party," with the aim of turning the proletarian party into a bourgeois party, turning the vanguard of the proletariat's attack on the bourgeoisie into a reactionary organization of the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat. If his conspiracy succeeds, then people will degenerate, the party will become revisionist, and the country will change color. What a dangerous scenario that would be! We must seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's great teachings on party rectification and building, criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the "extinction of class struggle," thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on party building, and resolutely smash the "good person's party." We must resolutely drive out all traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, stubborn walkers of the capitalist road, class enemies, and degenerate elements, and absorb true proletarian revolutionary fighters into the party, making the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China even more glorious, correct, and great.

    党是阶级斗争的工具

    正当全国掀起斗、批、改的高潮中，伟大领袖毛主席最近发出指示：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”毛主席的最新指示，象光芒万丈的灯塔照亮了整党建党的道路。这一最新指示，是马克思列宁主义建党学说的伟大发展，是我们党永远保持鲜红颜色的根本保证。无产阶级的政党就是要不断地吐故纳新，就是要在阶级斗争中不断清除废料，吸收新鲜血液。这样，才能保持党的先进性和战斗性，成为“能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，鼓吹“要做一个好的党员，建设一个好的党”。他打起他的“好人党”的招牌，大肆贩卖黑《修养》，闭口不谈那一个阶级的党员，那一个阶级的党。妄图使无产阶级的政党脱离阶级斗争，改变党的性质，使我们伟大的党变成“好人党”，也就是所谓“全民党”，即资产阶级的法西斯的党。这是中国赫鲁晓夫篡党的一个大阴谋，必须彻底揭穿。
    政党是阶级斗争的工具，根本不存在无阶级的、超阶级的“好人党”。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“好人党”要吸收些什么样的“党员”呢？看吧！他明目张胆地说什么：“东北有一万富农党员也不怕”；资本家“入了党了，则更好了”；用“特殊方法”培养一批资产阶级知识分子做“接班人”；有剥削也可以做党员，等等。在中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的操纵下，什么“红色资本家”、资产阶级技术“权威”，一个个被拉进党里来。事实很清楚，中国赫鲁晓夫妄图建立的“好人党”，就是从修正主义的垃圾堆里拣来的所谓“全民党”，就是一个藏污纳垢的大杂烩。
    中国赫鲁晓夫日夜梦想建立他的“好人党”，鼓吹“有自首变节行为的人，也可以选为中央委员”，于是大大小小的叛徒、特务被保护下来，并千方百计地让他们窃踞领导要职。中国赫鲁晓夫为什么对这一小撮叛徒、工贼、特务、反革命分子，这样关怀备至呢？他又为什么对我国革命领导阶级即工人阶级，及其最可靠同盟者贫下中农和其他劳动人民群众竭尽污蔑、打击之能事呢？伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”中国赫鲁晓夫就是一个最大的叛徒，最大的内奸。他所组织的“好人党”雏形，就是一个暗藏在共产党内的修正主义派别，就是他那个资产阶级司令部。
    中国赫鲁晓夫完全抹煞阶级斗争，鼓吹建设一个“好人党”，目的在于变无产阶级的党为资产阶级的党，变无产阶级向资产阶级进攻的先锋队为资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的反动组织。如果他的阴谋得逞，那时候，我们人要变质、党要变修、国要变色。那是何等危险的情景啊！我们必须认真学习深刻领会毛主席关于整党建党的伟大教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，彻底清除中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义建党路线的流毒，坚决砸烂“好人党”。坚决要把那些叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子、顽固不化的走资派、阶级异己分子、蜕化变质分子清除出去，把真正的无产阶级革命派战士吸收进来，使伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党，更加光荣、正确和伟大。
