New achievements have been made in production and construction in the liberated areas of Laos. The broad masses of peasants are carrying out mutual aid and cooperation, expanding the cultivated land area, and carrying out agricultural technological reforms.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the people in the liberated areas of Laos have not only achieved victory after victory in their struggle against American imperialist aggression but have also overcome various difficulties and achieved many successes in developing production.

To overcome the difficulties caused by the enemy's destruction of manpower and livestock, the peasants in the liberated areas of Laos have organized a large number of "mutual aid teams" and other forms of mutual aid organizations. Currently, there are approximately 5,000 mutual aid organizations in the provinces of Sam Neua, Xieng Khouang, Udomsai, Phongsali, Xam Neua, Xekong, and Saravane, with 70% to 80% of the peasant households participating.

In the areas around the Sixth Highway in Sam Neua, the Seventh Highway in Xieng Khouang, and the Ninth Highway in Saravane, thousands of peasant households have persisted in production despite the enemy's incessant attacks day and night. In the six villages of Taweng County in Xekong Province, once the crops were completely destroyed by the enemy's chemical poisons, the peasants immediately replanted the fields. The provinces of Udomsai, Saravane, and Xam Neua are frequently subjected to enemy attacks, and the peasants in these provinces have raised the slogan "Not an inch of land shall be left fallow."

Since 1965, the peasants in the liberated areas have invested 200,000 labor days to build and repair a large number of irrigation projects, irrigating approximately 10,000 hectares of land. In 1967, the peasants reclaimed about 500 hectares of land and converted hundreds of terraced fields into rice paddies.

To increase grain production, the peasants in the liberated areas not only expanded the cultivated land area but also carried out agricultural technological reforms and increased the variety of crops. Many provinces have established experimental fields to help peasants gain new experiences. Several provinces have also established primary agricultural technical schools.

Previously, Laos only planted late rice. Now, ten provinces are widely planting early rice. This year, the early rice yield in Xieng Khouang Province has increased by three times compared to last year. In the provinces of Sam Neua, Xam Neua, Saravane, and Xekong, the area planted with coarse grains has increased by 30% to 200% compared to last year, and the yield of late rice has increased by 10% to 20%. The total grain yield in many villages has generally increased by 20% to 25%, and some villages have even increased by 50%.

The self-sufficient production of the Lao Patriotic Forces' troops and organizations, although just beginning, has also achieved good results. In 1967, through this mass movement, approximately 1,000 tons of grain were produced, and now many troops and organizations have grain reserves.

The livestock and forestry production in the liberated areas of Laos have also increased. With the development of production and the stabilization of prices, the living standards of the people in the liberated areas are gradually improving. Famine has been eliminated in many areas, and grain reserves are continuously increasing.

The people in the liberated areas are providing more material support for the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. In 1967, the amount of grain donated by the people for the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation exceeded that of previous years, increasing by 40% compared to 1966. The people also sold approximately 3,000 tons of surplus grain, doubling the amount from 1966.

    老挝解放区生产建设取得新成就
    广大农民开展互助合作，扩大耕地面积，进行农业技术改革
    新华社康开十五日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝解放区人民在抗击美帝侵略的斗争中，不仅军事上取得节节胜利，而且克服各种困难，在发展生产方面也取得了许多成就。
    老挝解放区农民为了战胜由于敌人的破坏而缺少人力和畜力的困难，组织了大批“互助队”和其他形式的互助组织。在桑怒省、川圹省、乌多姆塞省、丰沙里省、甘蒙省、东方省和沙湾拿吉省，目前就有大约五千个互助组织，有百分之七十到八十的农户参加。
    在桑怒的六号公路、川圹的七号公路和沙湾拿吉的九号公路一带的数千户农民，不顾敌人不分昼夜的袭击，坚持生产。在东方省塔威县的六个村子，有一次庄稼全被敌人喷洒的化学毒药毁坏了，但是农民们马上又将这些田补种上作物。乌多姆塞省、沙湾拿吉省和甘蒙省是经常遭受敌人袭击的省份，这些省的农民提出了“不荒芜一寸土地”的口号。
    从一九六五年以来，解放区农民投入了二十万个劳动日，兴建和修复了大批水利工程，使约一万公顷土地得到灌溉。一九六七年，农民又开垦了约五百公顷土地，并把数以百计的梯田变成了水稻田。
    为了增加粮食产量，解放区农民不仅扩大了耕地面积，而且进行农业技术改革，增加作物品种。许多省通过种试验田，帮助农民取得新的经验。好几个省还建立了初级农业技术学校。
    过去老挝只种晚稻，现在有十个省广泛种植早稻。川圹省今年早稻的产量比去年增加了三倍。在桑怒省、甘蒙省、沙湾拿吉省和东方省，同去年相比，杂粮种植面积增加了百分之三十到两倍，晚稻的产量增加了百分之十到二十，粮食总产量一般都增加了百分之二十到二十五，许多村庄甚至增加了百分之五十。
    老挝爱国力量的部队和机关的自给自足生产，虽然是刚刚开始，但是也取得了良好的成绩。一九六七年，通过这种群众运动生产了约一千吨粮食，现在许多部队和机关都有存粮。
    老挝解放区的畜牧业和林业生产也有了增加。随着生产的发展和物价稳定，解放区人民的生活正在逐步改善。在许多地区已经消灭了饥荒，储备粮不断增加。
    解放区人民正在为抗美救国提供更多的物力。一九六七年，人民为抗美救国捐献的粮食数量超过了历年，比一九六六年多百分之四十。人民还交售了大约三千吨余粮，比一九六六年多一倍。
