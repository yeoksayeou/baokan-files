One morning, a disciplined column marched along a rugged mountain path towards the Zhangjiafang Production Brigade of the Yanjiatun Commune. The Red Guards, led by Wang Herong and his comrades, were especially joyful today. As they took quick steps, they sang revolutionary songs, determined to fulfill the glorious mission assigned by the Revolutionary Committee of Xujiazhuang Middle School and the Management Committee of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School—to go to the Zhangjiafang Production Brigade as accountants, to take root, blossom, and bear fruit among the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Zhangjiafang Production Brigade is a remote mountain village in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou City. Before liberation, the poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire village suffered from the oppression and exploitation of landlords and rich peasants year after year and could not even dream of entering a school. After liberation, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the poor and lower-middle peasants sent their children to school. However, under the poisonous influence of the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, some students, as the poor and lower-middle peasants said, "once they picked up the pen, they forgot the hoe." For many years, few graduates returned to the production teams. Therefore, the financial power of this production brigade had long been controlled by some bad elements, and they could not find a trustworthy poor and lower-middle peasant to be the accountant, so they could not seize back the financial power.

The matter of Zhangjiafang Production Brigade looking for an accountant was known to the comrades of the Management Committee of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School of Xujiazhuang Middle School in Zhangjiakou City. That very night, they studied this problem together with the school's Revolutionary Committee and some revolutionary teachers and students.

"Let revolutionary teachers and students take turns to be the accountant in Zhangjiafang every month!" "No! Zhangjiafang is far from the school, and this method cannot really help the poor and lower-middle peasants solve the problem."

A graduate representative stood up and said, "I firmly follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao. I will go!" "This won't work either! There are not just Zhangjiafang Production Brigade that needs accountants, and Zhangjiafang needs not just one accountant. You alone cannot meet the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

"The school, which is now managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, should face the new socialist countryside, organize outstanding graduates to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class aimed at cultivating accountants!" The suggestion from the representative of the Management Committee of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School immediately won the support of everyone. The plan to send accountants and cultured laborers with socialist consciousness to the poor and lower-middle peasants was thus decided.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, in addition to studying the works of Chairman Mao, new courses such as abacus and accounting were added, and experienced accountants from the villages who loved Chairman Mao, the collective, and labor were invited to teach.

After three weeks of study, they graduated. Thus, Wang Herong and his comrades packed their bags and set off on their journey.

Three hours later, they arrived at the Zhangjiafang Brigade. The entire village of poor and lower-middle peasants warmly welcomed them, holding up revolutionary books and portraits of Chairman Mao. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants could not suppress their excitement and shouted again and again, "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" They said, "We welcome such new schools!"

    “这样的新学校，我们贫下中农欢迎！”
    一天清晨，一支整齐的队伍沿着崎岖的山路，向着阎家屯公社张家房生产大队挺进。队伍里的红卫兵小将王合荣和他的战友们今天感到特别高兴。他们一边迈着轻快的脚步，一边唱着革命歌曲，决心去完成许家庄中学革委会和贫下中农学校管理委员会交给的光荣任务——到张家房生产大队当会计，在贫下中农中间生根开花结果。
    张家房生产大队，是张家口市郊区的一个偏僻的山村。解放前，全村贫下中农长年累月地受地主、富农的压迫和剥削，根本谈不上进学校的门。解放后，在毛主席的英明领导下，贫下中农把儿女们送到学校去读书。可是，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒害下，有些学生正象贫下中农所说的那样：一进学校的大门，“拿起了笔杆，就忘掉了锄杆”。多年来，毕业生回生产队的很少。因此，这个生产队的财权长期被一些坏人把持着，一直找不到一个贫下中农信得过的人当会计，财权总是夺不回来。
    张家房生产大队找会计的事，被张家口市许家庄中学贫下中农学校管理委员会的同志们知道了。当天晚上，他们就同校革委会和部分革命师生一起研究了这个问题。
    “革命师生按月轮换到张家房当会计吧！”“不行！张家房离学校很远，这种办法不能很好地帮助贫下中农解决问题。”
    一个毕业生代表站起来说：“我坚决走毛主席指引的路。我去！”“这也不行！需要会计的，不只张家房一个生产大队，张家房也不只需要这么一个会计。你一个人满足不了贫下中农的要求。”
    “我们这个已经由贫下中农管理的学校，要面向社会主义的新农村，组织优秀毕业生举办以培养会计为目的的毛泽东思想学习班！”贫下中农学校管理委员会代表的建议，立即得到了大家的支持。给贫下中农输送会计、输送有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者的方案就这样定下来了。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，同学们除了学习毛主席著作，还增设了珠算、账目等新课程，请农村中热爱毛主席、热爱集体、热爱劳动、具有实践经验的生产队会计任教师。
    经过三周的学习，他们毕业了。于是，王合荣和他的战友们背上背包，踏上了征途。
    三个小时后，他们来到张家房大队。全村贫下中农高举着革命宝书和毛主席画像热烈地欢迎他们。广大贫下中农抑制不住内心的激动，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们说：“这样的新学校，我们贫下中农欢迎！”
