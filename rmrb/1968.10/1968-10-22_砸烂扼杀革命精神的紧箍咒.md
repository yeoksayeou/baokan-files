	The great teacher Chairman Mao recently pointed out: “A person has arteries and veins, through the heart to circulate blood, and also through the lungs to breathe, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen, this is expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party also needs to expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without clearing out the waste and absorbing new blood, the party will lack vitality.” Whether it is clearing out the waste or absorbing new blood, it is all for the purpose of keeping our party forever red and forever full of revolutionary vigor.

	The great internal traitor, Chinese Khrushchev, has been spreading the reactionary “tame tool theory,” shouting loudly: “Not a tool, what else? Being a tool of the Party, is that good? Being a tame tool, is that good? Very good.” Chinese Khrushchev and his agents want to use the “tame tool theory” to strangle the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of Party members, turning Communist Party members into their loyal slaves in restoring capitalism. They also use this “tame tool theory” to cultivate and develop new Party members. Many comrades who dare to fight against the revisionist line are all regarded by them as “naughty tools” and are kept out of the Party’s gates for a long time.

	The handful of agents of Chinese Khrushchev in our factory have a good understanding of their black master’s intentions. They actively promote Chinese Khrushchev’s black “cultivation,” vigorously peddle the reactionary “tame tool theory,” and advocate that only “obedient and compliant” people can join the Party. Obviously, the so-called “obedient” here means requiring Party members to coexist peacefully with class enemies, turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the evil activities of a handful of spies, traitors, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders in restoring capitalism. The so-called “compliant” here means requiring Party members and revolutionary masses to listen to a handful of capitalist-roaders, letting them lead by the nose, and becoming their tame tools for restoring capitalism.

	Our factory was once under the rule of the reactionary “tame tool theory.” On one hand, some people with low consciousness and unqualified conditions joined the Party; some people, although they had problems, could join the Party as long as they followed the eyes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; some people, although they were spies, traitors, and counter-revolutionaries, could be promoted to leadership positions as long as they were the “tame tools” of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in conspiring to restore capitalism. On the other hand, some comrades with good class backgrounds and thoughts, but who dared to confront capitalist-roaders and resist the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, were regarded as “naughty tools.” The capitalist-roaders picked faults and made difficulties for their applications to join the Party, finding all sorts of excuses to obstruct these comrades from joining the Party.

	Our factory has an old worker who possesses a revolutionary style and dares to fight against capitalist-roaders. Once, a capitalist-roader, full of officialdom, ordered him to hold documents for him to read. This worker comrade was very indignant and firmly refused. From then on, a handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory regarded him as “untame” and ignored his application to join the Party, keeping him out of the Party’s gates all the time. After Chairman Mao’s latest instructions were issued, this old worker was moved to tears. He said excitedly: “Starting from 1958, I strongly requested to join the Party, three times asked others to help write written applications, and made countless oral applications, only because I dared to fight against capitalist-roaders and did not want to be their tame tool for restoring capitalism, they bore a grudge and made my application to join the Party sink into the sea time and time again. Chairman Mao’s latest instructions spoke the words in our hearts as workers. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, constantly improve my political consciousness, and strive to become a proletarian vanguard fighter who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.”

	These facts show that the “tame tool theory” is a shackle that strangles the revolutionary spirit of Communist Party members. We must smash this shackle, thoroughly clean out a handful of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other waste, and absorb revolutionary rebels with vigorous revolutionary fighting spirit to join the Party, building the Party into a “vibrant vanguard organization leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against class enemies.”

    砸烂扼杀革命精神的紧箍咒
    北京第二轧钢厂革委会政工组
    伟大导师毛主席最近指出：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”无论是清除废料，还是吸收新鲜血液，都是为了使我们的党永远保持鲜红的颜色，永远保持蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个大内奸，大肆散布反动的“驯服工具论”，声嘶力竭地叫嚣说：“不做工具，做什么？做党的工具好不好？做驯服的工具好不好？很好。”中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人就是妄想用“驯服工具论”，扼杀广大党员的无产阶级革命精神，把共产党员变成他们复辟资本主义的忠实奴仆。他们还按照“驯服工具论”这一套去培养和发展新党员。许多敢于同修正主义路线作斗争的好同志，统统被他们认为是“调皮的工具”，长期被关在党的大门之外。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在我们厂的一小撮代理人，很能体会其黑主子的苦心。他们积极推销中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》，极力贩卖反动的“驯服工具论”，鼓吹什么只有“老实、听话”的人才能入党。很明显，这里的所谓“老实”，就是要求党员同阶级敌人和平共处，对一小撮特务、叛徒和顽固不化的走资派复辟资本主义的罪恶活动听之任之，置若罔闻。这里的所谓“听话”，就是要求党员和革命群众听一小撮走资派的话，让他们牵着鼻子走，做他们复辟资本主义的驯服工具。
    我们厂一度在反动的“驯服工具论”的统治下，一方面，有的人觉悟不高，不具备条件，就入了党；有的人虽有问题，但会看党内一小撮走资派的眼色行事，就入了党；有的人虽是特务、叛徒、反革命分子，但由于是党内一小撮走资派阴谋复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”，就可以被提拔到领导岗位上来。另一方面，一些成份、思想都不错，但敢于顶撞走资派，敢于抵制反革命修正主义路线的好同志，就被看作是“调皮的工具”，对他们的入党申请，走资派吹毛求疵，百般刁难，寻找种种借口阻挠这些同志入党。
    我们厂有位老工人，具有革命的风格，敢于和走资派作斗争。有一次，走资派官气十足，硬叫他捧着文件给自己看，这位工人同志非常气愤，坚决地拒绝了。从此，厂里一小撮走资派就认为他不“驯服”，对他的入党申请置之不理，一直把他关在党的大门之外。当毛主席的最新指示发表以后，这位老工人感动得热泪盈眶。他万分激动地说：“从一九五八年开始，我就强烈地要求入党，三次请人帮助写书面申请，口头申请无数次，只因我敢于同走资派作斗争，不愿做他们复辟资本主义的驯服工具，他们就怀恨在心，使我的入党申请书一次又一次地石沉大海。毛主席的最新指示说出了我们工人阶级的心里话，我一定紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断提高自己的政治觉悟，争取早日成为对毛主席无限忠诚的无产阶级先锋战士。”
    这些事实说明，“驯服工具论”是扼杀共产党员革命精神的紧箍咒。我们一定要砸烂这个紧箍咒，彻底清除一小撮特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派等等废料，吸收具有旺盛革命斗志的造反派战士入党，把党建设成为“领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”。
