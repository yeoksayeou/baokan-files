Palestinian guerrillas, with the support of workers and residents, have been fighting side by side and launching heavy attacks on Israeli invaders in the Gaza Strip since late September. According to reports from the Syrian Arab News Agency and Syrian newspapers, the guerrillas have killed over 150 enemy soldiers, shot down one helicopter, and destroyed eight tanks and other military equipment.

Under the heavy blows from the guerrillas, the Israeli occupying authorities in the Gaza Strip hastily declared a curfew, dispatched troops to hunt down the guerrillas, and even used napalm and poison gas bombs to attack the mobile bases of the guerrillas near the town of Khan Yunis. They also carried out a roundup of Palestinian workers, youth, and residents.

The Israeli invaders' brutal suppression has sparked even more fierce resistance from the Palestinian people. On October 3, Palestinian workers in Gaza, together with the guerrillas, attacked the headquarters of the Israeli military commander in Gaza, killing and wounding over 30 enemy soldiers and destroying five military vehicles. The Palestinian guerrillas also laid mines on the railway near Khan Yunis, damaging long sections of railway between Gaza City and Khan Yunis, and between Ashdod and Beer Sheva. An Israeli train loaded with tanks and vehicles derailed near Khan Yunis, destroying three carriages.

The Palestinian guerrillas also shelled Israeli military facilities near the town of Beer Sheva in the Gaza Strip, hitting an Israeli chemical plant and causing a fire that burned for three days.

    在工人、居民支持下协同作战并肩战斗
    巴勒斯坦游击队猛袭加沙地带以侵略军
    据新华社大马士革七日电　据阿拉伯叙利亚通讯社和叙利亚报纸报道，巴勒斯坦游击队和工人、普通居民从九月底以来，在加沙地带向以色列侵略军发动多次袭击，共歼敌一百五十多名，击落一架直升飞机，击毁八辆坦克和其它军事装备。
    在游击队的沉重打击下，加沙地带的以色列占领当局慌忙宣布实行宵禁，派遣军队搜捕游击队，甚至用凝固汽油弹、毒瓦斯弹袭击汉尤尼斯市等附近的游击队流动基地。他们还对巴勒斯坦工人、青年和居民进行一次逮捕活动。
    以色列侵略军的疯狂镇压，激起巴勒斯坦人民的更猛烈反抗。十月三日，加沙的巴勒斯坦工人同游击队一起袭击了以色列驻加沙军事长官总部，打死打伤敌军三十余人，击毁军用车五辆。巴勒斯坦游击队还在汉尤尼斯铁路上埋设地雷，破坏了加沙市和汉尤尼斯市之间、阿什多特镇和比尔希巴市之间的两段很长的铁路，使汉尤尼斯附近一列装载坦克和车辆的以色列列车出轨，摧毁了三节车厢。
    巴勒斯坦游击队还炮轰加沙地带附近的比尔希巴市的以色列军事设施，击中以色列一个化工厂，使工厂起了大火，一连烧了三天。
