On the joyous occasion of celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, and amidst the great upsurge of struggle, criticism, and transformation, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued his latest instructions on cadres going down to the countryside to labor. This is the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, the greatest education, and the greatest spur for all cadres. It truly speaks to the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

The ship of the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres going down to the countryside to labor have cleared the obstacles for furthering the struggle, criticism, and transformation, pointed the way for cadres to unite with workers and peasants and to learn anew, and are a long-term strategy for preventing revisionism. They are the fundamental way to thoroughly change the spiritual outlook of cadres, promote the thought revolution of cadres, ensure that communists and revolutionary cadres maintain close ties with the masses, and prevent bureaucratism. They are a major measure to further consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants.

As early as 1943, Chairman Mao taught us: "We Communists are revolutionary and not mere politicians. We must have a thorough spirit of revolution, and we must not for a single moment detach ourselves from the masses. So long as we do not detach ourselves from the masses, we shall be invincible." Looking back on the difficult and trying years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the reason we had the strength to defeat the Japanese aggressors with our small rice and rifles against their airplanes and tanks was that our cadres, following Chairman Mao's teachings, were able to unite closely with the broad masses of the people and serve them wholeheartedly.

In 1964, Chairman Mao, in summing up the experience and lessons of the international communist movement, pointed out deeply: "Cadres participating in collective production labor is a fundamental matter in the socialist system." Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the working class and the laboring people. Mao Zedong Thought most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the working class and the broad laboring masses. Chairman Mao's words are all truth, and each character shines with golden light. Chairman Mao's latest instructions fully meet the aspirations of the poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants love those cadres who listen to Chairman Mao's words, who can go up and down, who can be officials and common people, and who roll with us poor and lower-middle peasants. We oppose those who are high and mighty, who point fingers and give orders, who love to put on airs, and who love to be bosses.

Labor is the true color of revolutionary cadres. If cadres always live in big buildings, sit in offices, give orders from on high, and do not participate in labor, they will not see the strength of the masses, will not understand the thoughts of the masses, and will not feel the sufferings of the masses. In the long run, they will become lazy, greedy, selfish, and corrupt, and will comfortably slide into the mire of revisionism and be unable to get out. We poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's latest instructions and will carry them out to the letter. We warmly welcome cadres coming down to the countryside to hold high the same banner as us poor and lower-middle peasants—the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study the same book—the Chairman's book, to grasp the same key—class struggle, to stand on the same line—the Chairman's revolutionary line, to walk the same path—the bright road of socialism, to eat from the same pot, to do the same work. Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and under the leadership of the working class, we will closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and work together to promote the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. With great enthusiasm, we will strive to be in the forefront, building socialism in the countryside quickly, efficiently, and with good results.

    毛主席最新指示最合贫下中农的心愿
    狼牙山五壮士之一、河南沁阳县北孔大队负责人　宋学义
    在举国欢庆伟大的中华人民共和国成立十九周年的大喜日子里，在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，伟大领袖毛主席发出了关于干部下放劳动的最新指示，这是对广大干部最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的教育，最大的鞭策，真说到俺贫下中农的心窝里了。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示，为进一步搞好斗、批、改扫清了障碍，为广大干部同工农结合，重新学习指明了方向，是反修防修的千年大计、万年大计，是彻底改变干部精神面貌，促进干部思想革命化的根本途径，是使共产党人和革命干部同广大群众保持密切联系，免除官僚主义的确实保证，是进一步巩固工农联盟的重大措施。
    早在一九四三年，毛主席就教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”回想在艰难困苦的抗日战争岁月里，我们之所以有力量，小米加步枪就能打败日本强盗的飞机加坦克，就在于我们的广大干部遵照毛主席的教导，能和广大人民群众紧密地团结在一起，全心全意地为人民服务。一九六四年，毛主席他老人家总结了国际共产主义运动的经验教训，又深刻地指出：干部参加集体生产劳动，“这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事”。毛主席是中国共产党的伟大领袖，是工人阶级和劳动人民的伟大领袖，毛泽东思想最集中地代表了工人阶级和广大劳动人民群众的根本利益，毛主席的话句句是真理，字字闪金光，毛主席的最新指示，完全符合贫下中农的心愿。俺贫下中农最喜欢那些听毛主席话的，能上能下，能“官”能民，和俺贫下中农滚在一起的好干部；反对那些高高在上，指手画脚，爱摆架子，好当撒手掌柜的官老爷。劳动是革命干部的本色。干部要是老住大楼，坐机关，高高在上，发号施令，不参加劳动，就看不到群众的力量，摸不着群众的思想，体会不到群众的疾苦。日久天长，他们就会变得懒、馋、占、贪，舒舒服服地滑到修正主义的泥坑拔不出脚来。俺贫下中农对毛主席的最新指示一千个拥护，一万个照办，热烈欢迎干部下乡来和俺贫下中农同举一面旗——毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同学一本书——毛主席的书，同抓一条纲——阶级斗争这条纲，同站一条线——毛主席的革命路线，同走一条路——社会主义光明道路，同吃一锅饭，同干一样活，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在工人阶级的领导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真搞好斗、批、改，同心协力搞好阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义新农村。
