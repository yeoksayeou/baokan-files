In the great wave of class struggle, criticism, and reform, the Shijiazhuang Tractor Parts Factory Revolutionary Committee has earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. By bringing about a revolution in production, the factory has completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule by more than two months and has exceeded the plan in all respects.

This year, the Shijiazhuang Tractor Parts Factory was tasked with producing over 5.5 million key tractor parts for the country. By October 20, the factory had already exceeded the annual production target by 22,000 pieces. The factory's total output value has increased by 46% compared to the same period last year and by 112.5% compared to 1966; the total output has increased by 49.6% compared to the same period last year and by 131.6% compared to 1966; production costs have been reduced by 21.1% compared to last year and by 56.4% compared to 1966; and the factory has achieved an overall leap forward.

After its establishment at the end of September last year, the factory's Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "streamlining administration," streamlined its organizational structure by transferring 87% of its office staff to the production front lines to strengthen the grassroots level. The number of full-time staff has been reduced from 396 to 23, and the three-tier management system of the factory, workshops, and work teams has been changed to a two-tier management system directly under the Revolutionary Committee. Members of the Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "be both an official and a common person," have insisted on participating in collective production labor and have taken root at the grassroots level. Office staff remaining at the factory Revolutionary Committee also take turns participating in labor or being sent down to work. These measures have further strengthened grassroots leadership, mobilized the revolutionary and productive enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, and effectively promoted production.

    石家庄拖拉机配件厂超额完成生产计划
    在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，石家庄拖拉机配件厂革命委员会认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，以革命带动生产，提前两个多月全面地超额完成了今年的生产计划。
    石家庄拖拉机配件厂今年担负着为国家生产五百五十多万件拖拉机主要配件的繁重生产任务。到十月二十日，这个厂已经超额两万二千件完成今年全年的生产任务。全厂的总产值比去年同期提高百分之四十六，比一九六六年提高百分之一百一十二点五；总产量比去年同期提高百分之四十九点六，比一九六六年提高百分之一百三十一点六；生产成本比去年降低百分之二十一点一，比一九六六年降低百分之五十六点四；实现了全面的跃进。
    这个厂的革命委员会在去年九月底建立以后，遵照毛主席关于“精兵简政”的教导，精简机构，把百分之八十七的科室人员下放到生产第一线，充实基层。全厂脱产人员由过去三百九十六名减少为二十三名，并且把过去的厂部、车间和工段三级管理改为革委会直接领导的两级管理。革委会成员根据毛主席的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，坚持参加集体生产劳动，扎根在基层。留在厂革委会的办事人员，也定期参加劳动或轮换下放劳动。这样做的结果，进一步加强了基层领导，调动了广大工人群众的革命和生产积极性，有力地促进了生产。（据新华社讯）
