In the new situation, as we carry out the movement to build model companies, we have followed Chairman Mao's great teachings on the mass line, mobilized the masses to hold "four-good month evaluations," and helped the party branch to emphasize proletarian politics. This approach has made the company's construction more correct, the ideological transformation of cadres and soldiers better, and ensured the successful completion of the "three supports, two militaries," and other tasks. We have been consecutively rated as a model company for three years.

To emphasize proletarian politics, we must rely on the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' spirit of initiative. We must mobilize the masses, let them rise up in revolution, educate themselves, manage themselves, and liberate themselves." Comrade Lin Biao points out: "Our politics is the politics of the masses, democratic politics. It must be managed by everyone, not by a few people. Everyone must be mobilized to speak out." Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao entrust the great revolutionary and political affairs to the masses. However, we used to think that "cadres handle major affairs, soldiers handle minor affairs." When we couldn't be rated as a model company, we blamed the soldiers for not being energetic. Later, the leading comrades of the division discovered that we emphasized proletarian politics without relying on the masses. They organized us to deeply study Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics. They also suggested holding a democratic meeting to mobilize all the soldiers to discuss the problems existing in the company and find the reasons for the company's backwardness. This meeting was very lively. Everyone raised many opinions, including sharp criticisms, sincere help, and earnest hopes. The platoon leader, Qu Mingzhen, first raised the following issue: In 1964, when the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing was promoting large-scale competitions, the deputy company leader squatted in the seventh platoon to train "elite" soldiers, squeezing out the time for studying Chairman Mao's works. At that time, he felt that focusing only on skills was problematic and had suggested to the deputy company leader, but the deputy company leader thought the platoon leader was meddling and did not listen. As a result, the seventh platoon's skills improved, but their ideology declined, and the model company rating for three years was ruined. After raising the issue, the platoon leader said: "Our company's backwardness lies in not emphasizing proletarian politics. Politics is the commander, the soul. 'Political work is the lifeline of all economic work.' We build our army with politics and fight with politics. Emphasizing proletarian politics is our army's glorious tradition. If we do not inherit this tradition well, how can we face Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao!" The soldiers' criticisms touched the souls of the cadres. Everyone deeply felt that the masses understand politics the best and care about politics the most. In the future, we must rely on the masses to emphasize proletarian politics, ensuring that Chairman Mao's principles and policies of emphasizing political construction and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics are truly implemented in the company.

Since then, we have established the "four-good month evaluation" system: every month, we organize the masses to study Chairman Mao's military thoughts and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics, and mobilize the masses to summarize the experiences and lessons of emphasizing proletarian politics. This approach has been very effective. When we once neglected the company's own revolutionary construction during the "three supports, two militaries," the masses timely sounded the alarm for us. They proposed: The stronger the political nature of the task, the more we must emphasize proletarian politics. If we do not emphasize proletarian politics when executing political tasks, this is the biggest danger! This alarm made us sober up, and we immediately focused on the company's revolutionary construction. We organized cadres and soldiers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspections of the North China, Central China, and East China regions, carried out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and raised everyone's awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle. When we only dealt with specific issues and neglected the fundamentals in executing production tasks, the soldiers gave us a quotation from Chairman Mao in the "four-good month evaluation": "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." They pointed out that the current political and ideological work should be closely centered around the revolutionary criticism. We felt that the soldiers' opinions were correct, so we combined self-criticism with criticism of revisionism, closely linked it with reality, and continuously criticized the black book "Self-Cultivation" for three months. This effectively raised the army's awareness of the two-line struggle.

Continuously correcting cadres' attitudes towards the masses' criticisms

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether inside or outside the party, there must be a full democratic life, that is, democratic centralism must be truly implemented. Problems must be openly discussed, and the masses must be allowed to speak, even if they criticize us, we must let them speak." We realized that to continue the "four-good month evaluation" and more deeply mobilize the masses to emphasize proletarian politics, we must continuously correct the cadres' attitudes towards the masses' criticisms.

After mobilizing the masses, how should we view soldiers who dare to raise opinions? Once, when we discussed whether the soldier Li Gefa could be elected as an active member of studying Mao Zedong Thought, a heated debate ensued. Li Gefa often raised opinions and sometimes criticized the leadership sharply. In July 1966, the great news of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River arrived. Our company was organizing swimming training and did not seriously organize the study of the editorial "Advancing with Chairman Mao in the Great Winds and Waves." Li Gefa criticized the cadres in the evaluation, saying: "Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River is a great joy that shakes the world. However, you only focus on 'breaststroke' and 'freestyle' and do not seriously organize the study. This is an attitude problem towards Chairman Mao." Some cadres felt they couldn't take it, and if Li Gefa were elected as an active member of studying Mao Zedong Thought, the soldiers would all learn from him, and the army would be difficult to manage. Most cadres disagreed with this view, believing that Li Gefa studied Chairman Mao's works and transformed his thoughts tightly. He always cared about the company's construction and raised opinions actively when he saw problems. Such a good comrade should be elected as an active member of studying Mao Zedong Thought. The party branch believed that the two opinions reflected the cadres' attitudes towards the masses' criticisms, relating to whether they could mobilize the masses to emphasize proletarian politics. We organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Every day you talk about 'arousing the masses,' but when the masses rise up, you are afraid to death. What's the difference between this and the story of Le Gong and the dragon!" This made everyone realize: To mobilize the masses to help the party branch emphasize proletarian politics, we must actively support and widely publicize those who care about state affairs and dare to uphold principles. We must encourage soldiers to be red guards of Chairman Mao's military line, so they can better supervise the leadership, continuously expose contradictions, and make the company advance in the struggle between the two military lines. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed to elect Li Gefa as an active member of studying Mao Zedong Thought and called on all comrades in the company to learn from him.

Since then, the cadres' attitudes towards the soldiers' criticisms have made a new leap. They treat the soldiers as their teachers and the soldiers' criticisms as the driving force for their ideological transformation. They also correct their shortcomings and mistakes according to the soldiers' correct opinions, emphasizing proletarian politics. Some cadres who could not correctly treat the soldiers' criticisms now actively open the door to welcome the soldiers' criticisms, no matter how sharp the criticisms are, they can sit still and listen. In this way, the soldiers dare to criticize the leadership more, and the emphasis on proletarian politics is better.

To emphasize proletarian politics, we must emphasize the transformation of cadres' thoughts.

We insist on the "four-good month evaluation," making the company's democratic atmosphere more and more intense. To better mobilize the masses to help the party branch and cadres emphasize proletarian politics, we organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's discussions on criticism and self-criticism, making everyone realize that "the main task of criticism is to point out political and organizational errors." When helping cadres, we must focus on major is-issues and non-issues, and focus on the transformation of worldviews. "The transformation of worldviews is a fundamental transformation." The facts prove: Only by emphasizing the transformation of cadres' worldviews can we emphasize proletarian politics in the company.

For a period, our company leader only focused on tasks and neglected thoughts. The soldiers criticized him for not emphasizing proletarian politics. He heard the criticism and thought that focusing on tasks was not beneficial to himself, so he went to the other extreme and did not focus on tasks at all. The soldiers criticized him again, saying he was "like a novice driver, driving the car, swerving left and right, and never driving the correct path of emphasizing proletarian politics." Why did this happen? In the "four-good month evaluation," everyone helped him find the reason from the worldview, pointing out bluntly that the main problem was the "self." In the past, only focusing on tasks and neglecting thoughts was to complete the task and make oneself look good; later, not focusing on tasks at all was to avoid criticism and make oneself look good. The soldiers' criticisms touched his soul. He brought this issue, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the Fourth Red Army's Communist Party exists various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the party's correct line," and fought against the "self," raising his awareness. From then on, he insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics, taking political and ideological excellence as the commander, and promoting the three-eight work style, military training, and life management.

In the past, the political instructor Tang Caiying valued personal honor very much. He specially bought a small red notebook, recording the time, place, and brief achievements of his merits and awards since enlisting, naming it "honor notebook." He also wrote two sentences in the notebook: "Distinguish honor and disgrace, write one's own red history; strive for more, do not let stains stain one's honor." This heavy burden made him cautious and lacking in initiative in his work. In the "four-good month evaluation," after the soldiers' criticisms and help, he decided to eliminate selfishness, throw away the burden, burned the "honor notebook," and replaced it with a notebook recording his thoughts on transformation. In this notebook, he also wrote two sentences: Fight selfishness and revisionism, forever loyal to Chairman Mao. Since then, the political instructor has been continuously studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought with problems, exploding a revolution in his soul, and making great progress in ideological transformation. In various works, he emphasizes proletarian politics.

The masses' help to cadres in emphasizing the transformation of thoughts has greatly changed the spiritual face of our company's leading cadre group. Emphasizing proletarian politics has become more conscious, promoting the company's revolutionary construction. Our company's cadres are advancing, and our company is advancing. This is the result of insisting on mobilizing the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and this is the great victory of Chairman Mao's mass line!

    依靠群众把好突出无产阶级政治关  保证连队沿着毛主席建军路线胜利前进
    人民解放军沈阳部队第二次四好连队代表大会代表　某部八连党支部
    在新形势下开展四好连队运动中，我们遵循毛主席关于群众路线的伟大教导，放手发动群众开展“四好月讲评”，帮助党支部把好突出无产阶级政治的关。这样做，使连队建设的路子越走越正，干部战士的思想革命化越来越好，胜利地完成了“三支”“两军”和其他各项任务，连续三年被评为四好连队。
    突出无产阶级政治必须紧紧依靠群众
    毛主席教导我们：“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。要放手发动群众，让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己。”林副主席指出：“我们的政治是群众的政治，民主的政治，要靠大家来治，而不是靠少数人治，一定要发动人人开口。”毛主席和林副主席把革命的大事、政治的大事交给群众来管。可是，我们过去却认为“干部管大事，战士管小事”。评不上四好，总怪战士不争气。后来，师的领导同志发现我们突出无产阶级政治不依靠群众，便组织我们深入学习毛主席关于群众路线的教导和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示，并且建议召开一次民主大会，发动全连战士大摆连队存在的问题，大找连队落后的原因。这次大会开得很热烈，大家提了许多意见，有尖锐的批评，有诚恳的帮助，有殷切的希望。七班长曲明臻先摆了这样一个问题：一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿搞大比武的时候，副连长蹲在七班抓“尖子”训练，把学习毛主席著作的时间挤掉了。当时，他觉得光抓技术有问题，曾对副连长提出意见，可副连长觉得七班长瞎操心，根本没有听，结果七班的技术上了坡，思想却走下坡，三年的四好垮了下来。七班长摆完了问题接着说：“我们连落后就落后在不突出无产阶级政治上。政治是统帅，是灵魂。‘政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。’我们是靠政治建军，靠政治打仗。突出无产阶级政治是我军的光荣传统，我们不好好继承这个传统，怎么对得起毛主席，怎么对得起林副主席！”战士们的批评触动了干部的灵魂，大家深深感到：群众最懂得政治，最关心政治。今后，我们一定要紧紧依靠群众把好突出无产阶级政治关，使毛主席着重政治建军的方针原则和林副主席突出无产阶级政治的指示，在连队真正落实。
    从这以后，我们建立了“四好月讲评”制度：月月组织群众学习毛主席建军思想和林副主席突出无产阶级政治的指示，发动群众总结突出无产阶级政治的经验教训。这样做，效果很好。当我们在“三支”“两军”中一度忽视连队自身革命化建设时，群众及时给我们敲了警钟。他们提出：任务的政治性越强，就越要突出无产阶级政治。在执行政治任务中不突出无产阶级政治，这可是最大的危险！这个警钟使我们头脑清醒起来，立即狠抓连队革命化建设，组织干部战士反复学习毛主席视察华北、中南、华东三大区时的最新指示，开展斗私批修，提高了大家的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。当我们在执行生产任务中，只就事论事地抓活思想，忽视抓根本时，在“四好月讲评”中，战士们送给我们一条毛主席语录：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”指出当前政治思想工作应该紧紧围绕革命大批判来进行。我们觉得，战士们的意见很对，就把斗私和批修结合起来，紧密联系实际，对黑《修养》连续批了三个月，有效地提高了部队的两条路线斗争觉悟。
    不断端正干部对待群众批评的态度
    毛主席教导我们：“不论党内党外，都要有充分的民主生活，就是说，都要认真实行民主集中制。要真正把问题敞开，让群众讲话，那怕是骂自己的话，也要让人家讲。”我们体会到，要把“四好月讲评”坚持下去，更深入地发动群众把好突出无产阶级政治关，就要不断地端正干部对待群众批评的态度。
    群众发动起来以后，对于敢提意见的战士应该怎么看？有一次，我们在讨论战士李阁发能不能当选学习毛泽东思想积极分子的问题时，展开了一场激烈的争论。李阁发平时好提意见，有时批评领导很尖锐。一九六六年七月，伟大领袖毛主席畅游长江的喜讯传来，我们连正在组织游泳训练，没有认真组织学习《跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进》这篇社论。李阁发在讲评中批评干部说：“毛主席畅游长江，这是震动世界的大喜事。可是你们光抓‘蛙式’、‘自由式’，不好好组织学习，这是对毛主席的态度问题。”有的干部感到吃不消，如果选李阁发当学习毛泽东思想积极分子，战士们都向他学习，部队带起来就不顺手。多数干部不同意这个看法，认为李阁发平时学习毛主席著作，改造思想抓得很紧。他时时刻刻关心连队建设，看到问题能积极提出改进意见。象这样一个好同志，应当选为学习毛泽东思想积极分子。党支部认为上面的两种意见，反映了干部对待群众批评的态度，关系到能不能发动群众把好突出无产阶级政治关的问题。我们组织大家学习毛主席的教导：“嘴里天天说‘唤起民众’，民众起来了又害怕得要死，这和叶公好龙有什么两样！”使大家认识到：要发动群众帮助支部把好突出无产阶级政治关，就要对关心国家大事、敢于坚持原则的同志，积极支持，大力宣扬。要鼓励战士当捍卫毛主席建军路线的红色哨兵，这样，就能更好地监督领导，不断地揭露矛盾，使连队在两条建军路线的斗争中不断前进。最后，大家一致同意李阁发为学习毛泽东思想积极分子，并且号召全连同志向他学习。
    从这以后，干部对战士批评的态度有了一个新的飞跃。他们把战士当成自己的老师，把战士的批评当成自己思想革命化的动力，并按照战士的正确意见改正缺点错误，把好突出无产阶级政治关。原来有的干部不能正确对待战士的批评，现在也主动敞开大门欢迎战士批评，不管批评多么尖锐，都坐得住，听得进。这样，战士批评领导更加大胆了，突出无产阶级政治的关把得更好了。
    把好突出无产阶级政治关，必须把好干部思想改造关
    我们坚持“四好月讲评”，使连队的民主空气越来越浓厚。为了更好地发动群众帮助支部和干部把好突出无产阶级政治关，我们组织大家学习了毛主席关于批评和自我批评的论述，使大家认识到，“批评的主要任务，是指出政治上的错误和组织上的错误。”帮助干部时要抓大是大非问题，抓世界观的改造问题。“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。事实证明：只有把好干部世界观改造的“关”，才能把住连队突出无产阶级政治的关。
    有一段时间，我们连长只抓任务不抓思想，战士们批评他不突出无产阶级政治。他听了这个批评，认为抓任务对自己不利，又走向另一个极端，索性不抓任务了。战士又批评了他，还说他“象一个初学开车的司机，开着车子，东闯一下，西闯一下，老走不正突出无产阶级政治的路子。”为什么会出现这种现象呢？在“四好月讲评”中，大家从世界观上帮助他找了原因，一针见血地指出，主要是“私”字作怪。过去只抓任务不抓思想，是为了完成任务自己脸上光采；后来干脆不抓任务，是为了怕别人批评自己脸上不好看。战士们的批评触动了他的灵魂。他带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席关于“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大”的教导，狠斗了“私”字，提高了认识，从此他坚持突出无产阶级政治，以政治思想好为统帅，带动三八作风、军事训练和生活管理。
    过去，指导员汤才英对个人的荣誉看得很重，专门买了个小红本，把自己入伍以后立功受奖的时间、地点、简要功绩，都一次一次地登记起来，取名叫“荣誉本”，还特别在本上写了两句话：“分清誉辱，写自己的红色历史；再接再厉，不让污点玷污自己的荣誉。”就是这个沉重的包袱，压得他工作上谨小慎微，缺乏一种闯劲。在“四好月讲评”中，经过战士的批评帮助，他决心铲除私心，甩掉包袱，把“荣誉本”烧掉了，换了个记载自己改造思想体会的本子。在这个本子上，也写上了两句话：斗私批修，永远忠于毛主席。从这以后，指导员不断带着问题活学活用毛泽东思想，在灵魂深处爆发革命，思想革命化有了很大进步，在各项工作中突出无产阶级政治。
    群众帮助干部把好思想改造“关”，使我们连的领导班子的精神面貌发生了很大变化。突出无产阶级政治更自觉了，促进了连队革命化建设。我们连的干部在前进，我们的连队在前进，这是坚持用毛泽东思想放手发动群众的结果，这是毛主席的群众路线的伟大胜利！
