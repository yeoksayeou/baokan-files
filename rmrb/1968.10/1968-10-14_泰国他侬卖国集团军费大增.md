According to reports from Thai newspapers, the Thanom reactionary government approved the 1968-1969 fiscal budget at the end of September. The total expenditure is 23.96 billion baht. To accommodate the U.S. imperialists' expansion of the Vietnam War, the new budget allocates 3.77 billion baht for military expenses, an increase of 114.3% compared to 1.76 billion baht in 1964. The so-called "Construction Department," which is responsible for building strategic roads and military facilities for the Americans, has an expenditure of 5.05 billion baht, an increase of 191.2% compared to 1.73 billion baht in 1964. The so-called "Ministry of the Interior," which is used to suppress the armed forces of the Thai people, has an expenditure of 5.106 billion baht. These three items alone account for more than half of the total expenditure.

The Thanom clique, in order to maintain these enormous military expenditures, is stepping up the exploitation of the people, imposing heavy taxes, issuing excessive currency, and borrowing heavily from both domestic and foreign sources.

    泰国他侬卖国集团军费大增
    据泰国报纸报道，他侬反动政府九月底通过了一九六八——一九六九年度财政预算。预算支出总额为二百三十九亿六千万铢。为了适应美帝国主义扩大侵越战争需要，在新预算中军费为三十七亿七千多万铢，比一九六四年的十七亿六千多万铢增加百分之一百一十四点三。为美国修筑战略公路和军事设施的所谓“建设部”支出为五十亿五千四百九十九万九千二百多铢，比一九六四年十七亿三千五百六十万八千七百铢增加百分之一百九十一点二。用于镇压泰国人民武装力量的所谓“内政部”支出为五十一亿零六百一十多万铢。以上三项支出就超过了支出总额的一半以上。
    他侬集团为了维持以上庞大军事开支，加紧对人民进行搜刮，强征苛捐杂税，滥发通货，并向国内外大举借债。
