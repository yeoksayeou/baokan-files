The Thai Communist Party-led people's armed forces have continuously achieved new victories in various regions in late September and early October.

According to a recent broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the Thai people's armed forces, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, have launched multiple attacks on the enemy and achieved new victories.

In northern Thailand's Chiang Rai Province, the people's armed forces recently launched several attacks on the enemy and repulsed enemy advances. On September 17, the people's armed forces attacked a military police outpost of the Thanom government in Wang Saen District, killing and wounding many enemies. This armed force also broke through enemy sieges multiple times. At the end of September, the people's armed forces raided an enemy outpost in Wang Pa District. From September 30 to October 6, the people's armed forces ambushed and attacked the enemy three times in Chiang Kham District, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy.

According to admissions by the Thanom government, from September 30 to October 5, the people's armed forces in Udon Thani Province in northeastern Thailand launched three attacks on military police stations in the province's direct jurisdiction and in Laem Narong County. During the same period, the people's armed forces in Nakhon Phanom Province and Sakhon Nakhon Province also bravely attacked reactionary military police stations.

In southern Thailand, the Thanom government mobilized large numbers of military police and colluded with the Rahman government of "Malaysia" to brutally suppress the people's armed forces and people along the Thai-Malaysian border. However, they suffered heavy losses from the people's armed forces. For example, on September 29, the Thanom government's police force suffered losses in the face of a fierce attack by the people's armed forces.

In central Thailand's Phrae Province, the people have begun revolutionary armed struggles. On September 30, the people's armed forces in Nong Phrae County severely punished a reactionary village head and fiercely repelled reactionary police who came to suppress the people. This armed force has shown invincible power from the start, making the American-Thai reactionary clique very afraid. On October 8, the Thanom government sent the chief of staff of the Third Military Region and the police chief of Phrae Province, accompanied by American military officers, to inspect the situation by helicopter to plan further suppression of the people's armed struggles in Phrae Province.

The development of armed struggles by the people in various parts of Thailand has made the American imperialists and their lackey Thanom government flustered. In September, U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Unger went to the northeastern province of Loei to inspect the defeats of the American-Thai reactionaries and to plan the next steps of suppression. Unger, along with the chief of the U.S. Military Advisory Group and the chief of staff of the Thai reactionary army, Thawin Chonlasit, went to Surat Thani Province in the south on October 4. The head of the Thai puppet government, Thanom, is also scheduled to rush to the southern province of Narathiwat on October 12.

According to the revelation by the American lackey Thawin Chonlasit, after October 20, he will secretly meet with the deputy prime minister of the Malaysian reactionary government, Razak, at the Thai-Malaysian border to plot the intensified suppression of the people along the Thai-Malaysian border.

No matter how desperately the American imperialists and their lackey Thanom government struggle, they cannot stop the development of the patriotic armed struggles of the Thai people. The people's armed forces and people in various parts of Thailand are determined to deal an even heavier blow to the American-Thai reactionaries.

    泰共领导的人民武装不断取得新胜利
    泰国中部彭世洛府也燃起革命武装斗争烽火
    新华社十二日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台最近广播，泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民武装，在九月下半月和十月初，在各地打击敌人，不断取得新的胜利。
    泰国北部清莱府人民武装最近向敌人发动多次进攻，并击退敌人的进犯。九月十七日，人民武装在挽糖县进攻他侬集团军警的据点，打死打伤敌人多人。这支人民武装还多次打破敌人的围攻。九月底，人民武装在挽攀县袭击敌人据点。九月三十日到十月六日，人民武装又在清堪县伏击和袭击敌人三次，沉重地打击了敌人。
    据他侬集团承认，从九月三十日到十月五日，泰国东北部的乌隆府人民武装曾在这个府的直辖县和廊磨喃蒲县一带，三次袭击他侬集团的军警驻地。同一期间，在那空拍侬府和沙功那空府，人民武装也曾英勇地袭击了反动军警驻地。
    在泰国南部，他侬集团出动大批军警并同“马来西亚”的拉赫曼集团勾结，疯狂镇压泰马边境的人民武装和人民。但是，他们受到了人民武装的沉重打击。例如在九月二十九日，他侬集团的警察部队在人民武装的猛烈打击下，遭到了损失。
    在中部彭世洛府，人民已开始了革命武装斗争。九月三十日，这个府人民武装在那空泰县严惩了一名反动村长，并痛击了前往镇压人民的反动警察。这支人民武装队伍，一开始就显示了不可战胜的威力，使美泰反动集团十分害怕。十月八日，他侬集团派遣了第三军区参谋长和彭世洛府的警察头子陪同美国军官坐直升飞机前往视察，以便部署进一步镇压彭世洛府人民的武装斗争。
    泰国各地人民武装斗争的发展使美帝和它的走狗他侬集团手忙脚乱。九月间，美国驻泰国大使昂格尔曾去东北部黎府视察美泰反动派的败绩，并部署下一步的镇压步骤。昂格尔又于十月四日伙同美军顾问团团长以及泰国反动军队总参谋长他威·尊拉塞到南部素叻他尼府活动。泰国傀儡政府头子他侬也定于十月十二日赶到南部洛坤府去。
    据美帝走狗他威·尊拉塞透露，在二十日以后，他将去泰马边境与“马来西亚”反动政府副总理拉扎克秘密会晤，以便策划加紧镇压泰马边境人民。
    不管美帝和它的走狗他侬集团如何疯狂挣扎，都决不能阻止泰国人民爱国武装斗争的发展。泰国各地人民武装和人民决心给予美泰反动派更加沉重的打击。
