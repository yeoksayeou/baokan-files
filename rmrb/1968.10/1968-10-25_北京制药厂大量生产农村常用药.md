In the midst of the great struggle to carry out the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory, under the great guidance of Chairman Mao's directive to "put medical and health work on a wartime footing," have sent people to the countryside to investigate the needs of poor and lower-middle peasants for medicines. They have launched a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line pursued by China's Khrushchev and his agents, striving to produce more and better medicines needed by the countryside. They have thought of the needs of the "barefoot doctors" and served the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Currently, the factory's production of medicines that are in great demand in the countryside is increasing. For example, the daily output of "Xiao'er'an" and "eye drops," which are highly praised by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, has increased by 60 percent and nearly three times, respectively, compared to before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The cost of medicines has also been reduced. The factory's service station, which originally produced small quantities of medicines for temporary use by urban hospitals, now not only serves urban hospitals but also produces some medicines needed temporarily by the countryside. To provide convenience for "barefoot doctors," the workers are preparing to change some large-package medicines into small packages, change liquid and powder medicines into pills, and conduct analysis and research on folk and secret prescriptions collected from the countryside, and have already produced four kinds of medicines.

    北京制药厂大量生产农村常用药
    在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，北京制药厂革命工人在伟大领袖毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大指示指引下，派人到农村调查贫下中农对药品的需要情况，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线，努力生产更多更好的农村需要的药品，替“赤脚医生”着想，为贫下中农服务。
    现在，这个厂所生产的农村大量需要的药品，产量正在提高。如深受广大贫下中农欢迎的“小儿安”和“眼药水”，目前日产量分别比无产阶级文化大革命以前增加了百分之六十和近三倍，药品的成本也降低了。这个厂原来专门为城市医院生产临时需要的小量药品的服务站，现在不仅为城市医院服务，也生产农村临时需要的某些药品供应农村。为了给“赤脚医生”提供方便，工人们准备把一些大包装药品改成小包装，将水剂、粉剂药品改成片剂，把从农村搜集来的民间偏方、秘方加以分析研究，进行试制，并已制成了四种药品。（据新华社讯）
