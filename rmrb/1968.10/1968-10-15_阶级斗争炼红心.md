Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most of the children in Jianchangpu Brigade, Shancizizi Commune, Benxi County, Liaoning Province, were little troublemakers. They were either climbing trees to steal crows' nests or going to the river to catch fish and shrimp, and they had no idea what class and class struggle were.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution greatly popularized the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and Jianchangpu underwent earth-shaking changes. The children's spiritual outlook also changed greatly. They organized the "Red Children's Team," set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and after school every day, they studied Chairman Mao's works and the latest directives together in conjunction with the class struggle situation, and engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. They also held criticism meetings, facing the class enemies head-on in struggle. Through the tempering of class struggle, the children became red-hearted and clear-eyed, with a strong sense of right and wrong, and were known as the little vanguards in class struggle.

One day, thirteen-year-old Sun Jiaji and the children of the "Red Children's Team" went to work in the fields more than two miles away from the village. Suddenly, a fire started on the mountain. Sun Jiaji immediately ran to the nearest house to get a water bucket.

This was the home of a local traitor and turncoat. According to the generation, this bad guy was Sun Jiaji's "third uncle." A few days earlier, Sun Jiaji and the Red Children had severely criticized and struggled against this guy. After the fire was extinguished, it was already around four in the afternoon, and Sun Jiaji was both hungry and tired. When he went to this bad guy's house to return the water bucket, he saw that the table was set with food. This guy held Sun Jiaji tightly and whispered, "Little one, you're young and don't understand. We're close relatives, after all. It's fine if you struggled against me and scolded me in the past. It doesn't matter. Just change in the future! Come and eat some food, warm up your body."

Sun Jiaji saw this scene, and Chairman Mao's teachings immediately rang in his ears: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will still make their last struggles in various ways. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption every day and every hour, trying to restore their power in China. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance." Sun Jiaji thought, Chairman Mao's teachings are very important. Although this bad guy has been overthrown, he is still alive, his heart is not dead, and he is always dreaming of a comeback. He must not be let off. Therefore, he pointed at this traitor's nose and shouted, "You're a wolf in sheep's clothing! I won't fall for your honey-coated bullets!" "Don't get angry, this is just a little bit of goodwill from your third uncle!" Sun Jiaji was already boiling with anger. He said, "Who are you to be my third uncle? You are a black claw of the Chinese Khrushchev, an enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Whether you are my third uncle or fourth uncle, as long as you oppose Chairman Mao, we will struggle against you until you are more despised than dog shit!" This bad guy's face turned red, and he opened his mouth a few times as if to say something, but Sun Jiaji glared at him with round eyes, raised his fist, and said, "Get out of here! Don't be so stubborn. See you at the struggle meeting tomorrow!" With that, he walked away in big strides. After the "Red Children's Team" heard about this incident, they all said that Sun Jiaji's stance was firm and his struggle was resolute, and he was worth learning from.

    阶级斗争炼红心
    辽宁省本溪县山城子公社碱厂堡大队的少年儿童们，在文化大革命以前，多数是小淘气包，不是上树掏老鸦窝，就是下河抓鱼摸虾，不懂得什么是阶级和阶级斗争。
    无产阶级文化大革命大大普及了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，碱厂堡发生了翻天覆地的变化，孩子们的精神面貌也大大变了样。他们组织了“红孩子队”，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，每天放学后，都在一起结合阶级斗争形势学习毛主席著作和最新指示，一起斗私批修。他们还开批判会，面对面地和阶级敌人进行斗争。经过阶级斗争的锻炼，孩子们个个心红眼亮，爱憎分明，被称为阶级斗争中的小闯将。
    一天，十三岁的孙学家和“红孩子队”的孩子们，一起到离村二里多远的地里劳动。突然山上起了火，孙学家立即跑到离着火地点最近的一户人家去找水桶。
    这是本地一个投敌叛变分子的家。按辈数，这个坏家伙是孙学家的“三大爷”。头几天，孙学家和红孩子们一起狠狠地批斗了这个家伙。山火扑灭了，已是下午四点多钟了，孙学家又饥又饿。他到这个坏家伙家里还水桶时，看到桌上摆好了饭菜。这家伙死拉住孙学家不放，小声说：“小家，你人小不懂事，咱们可是近亲戚呀，过去你斗我、骂我，那不要紧，我都不记在心里，今后改了就行了！来吃点饭，暖和一下身子。”孙学家一看这情景，耳旁立刻响起了毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”孙学家心想，毛主席的教导十分重要，这个坏家伙虽然被斗倒了，但他人还在，心不死，时时刻刻在梦想翻案，决不能饶了他。于是，他指着这个投敌分子的鼻子大声说：“你这是黄鼠狼给鸡拜年，没安好心！我不中你的糖衣炮弹！”“别发火，这是三大爷的一点点心意！”孙学家心里早已火冒三丈，他说：“你是谁的三大爷，你是中国赫鲁晓夫的黑爪牙，是我们贫下中农的死对头。不管你是什么三大爷还是四大爷，只要你反对毛主席，我们就要把你斗得比狗屎还臭！”这个坏家伙涨红着脸，张了几下嘴还想说什么，孙学家瞪着圆眼睛，一提拳头对他说：“滚开！别罗索了，明天斗争会上见！”说完，便大步流星地走了。“红孩子队”知道这件事后，都说孙学家立场站得稳，斗争坚决，值得学习。
