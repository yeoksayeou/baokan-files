The revolutionary committee of the Piziwo Chemical Factory in Liaoning, after streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "being both an official and a commoner" and the latest instructions for cadres to go down to the grassroots for labor. They organized a large number of office staff to work in production teams as workers, living and working alongside the workers, providing new experiences for the revolutionization of the office and cadres, and for strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

Receiving Re-education from the Working Class

Piziwo Chemical Factory is a comprehensive seawater utilization chemical plant primarily producing salt. Since liberation, due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of power-building pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory, the organization became bloated and inefficient. In just one year, 1959, the number of cadres increased from 245 to 321. Some cadres, due to long-term desk work, became detached from labor and the masses, leading to laziness and a decline in spirit. Even some cadres who were promoted from workers changed, losing the calluses on their hands and the salt brine smell on their bodies, and becoming more and more bureaucratic.

In August this year, the factory revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings on streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, carried out a thorough reform of the old organization. They sent 206 office staff, accounting for 70% of all cadres, to work in 190 production teams, living and working with the workers, sharing meals, housing, labor, study, and class struggle. These cadres, after going down to the production teams, received deep education from the working class.

A former deputy director of the Quality Inspection Department, who was originally a worker, returned to the chemical workshop's potassium washing section to participate in labor. Once, the team leader went out on business, temporarily leaving him in charge of quality control. He thought, "I've worked here for many years, and after being promoted, I've read some related books, so I should be better than the workers. There shouldn't be any problem with me taking over this shift." However, things did not go as he wished. He took over three shifts, and two of them produced defective products. This incident deeply educated him.

Through going down to the grassroots for labor, many cadres deeply felt that:

"The path of going down to the grassroots for labor is indicated by Chairman Mao, the opportunity to re-learn is given by the worker masses, the working class is our natural teacher, and in front of the worker masses, we are forever ungraduated students."

In Hard Labor, Tempering Oneself

A large number of cadres went down to the production teams to work as workers, facing various obstacles, primarily ideological ones. Some cadres were influenced by the poison of Chinese Khrushchev's "party membership means becoming an official" theory, only wanting to be officials and not ordinary laborers. Workers said, "Some people, after becoming officials, forget their roots. If they don't reform well, they will fall into the quagmire of revisionism!" The factory revolutionary committee, in response to the ideological state of the cadres going down to the grassroots, first studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on cadres going down to the grassroots to prevent revisionism. They also launched a revolutionary criticism campaign, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize Chinese Khrushchev's "party membership means becoming an official" theory, and established the idea of "being both an official and a commoner."

The cadres going down to the grassroots, through sharing meals and hard labor with the workers, received profound education. Old worker Li Renxin used a callus on his shoulder, formed from carrying salt for the landlord, to vividly recount the bloody history of the old society. In the course of hard labor, he used this callus to criticize Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious," making the cadres vividly see the bitterness of "retreating." This aroused the cadres to establish Chairman Mao's teaching of "we communists are not here to be officials, but to make revolution." Today, when they pick up the heavy salt baskets again, their feelings are different. They said, "In the old society, the sweat from carrying salt baskets flowed onto the landlord's salt, but today, carrying salt baskets is contributing to the construction of socialism." They felt from the bottom of their hearts that the shoulder pole and salt basket are not only ordinary labor tools but also weapons for eliminating bureaucratic tendencies and preventing revisionism.

To make the office staff consciously regard labor as a means to temper themselves, the factory revolutionary committee organized them to study Chairman Mao's teachings on hard struggle, thoroughly criticize the harms of detachment from labor, establish the idea of enduring hardship for the revolution, and raise the cadres' awareness of fighting against bureaucratic tendencies in labor. One rainy night, while rushing to harvest salt, a cadre pulling a large rake slipped and fell into the salt pond because his hands were covered in brine, making the rake handle slippery. He thought, "If I were in the office, I wouldn't have to endure this hardship." As soon as this thought arose, he pushed it back with Chairman Mao's latest instructions on a large number of cadres going down to the grassroots. He thought this fall was good, as it knocked off a bit of bureaucratic airs and added a bit of the common laborer's spirit. He said, "Covered in brine, I've washed away the mud in my thoughts."

In Labor, Contributing to the People

The key for a large number of cadres going down to the grassroots for labor is to engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism. Only by sincerely accepting the re-education of the workers and thoroughly transforming their worldview can they contribute to the people.

This factory had two cadres who once served as director and deputy director of a workshop and were now sent down to the same team. Due to their different understandings of Chairman Mao's teachings on a large number of cadres going down to the grassroots for labor, their performances were vastly different. One production director, after going down to the team for labor, held the attitude of "just getting by" and "following the trend," never intending to settle down in the team. In labor, he was always pushing and pulling; in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, he was always evasive. The masses were indignant, saying, "In the office, he was a bureaucratic lord, and down here, he is a vagabond, with no trace of a laborer!"

However, another deputy director, after going down to the team for labor, held the attitude of cherishing every second of labor time, producing one more ton of sea salt for the state, and contributing to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He always stayed at his labor post. Once, the team leader went out on business, and he voluntarily took over the team leader's water-running duties. It happened to be a night with heavy rain forecast. Before the rain, he didn't even have time to eat, working until late at night to circle the brine in one pond after another. As soon as the rain stopped, he rushed to the muddy salt flats to drain the rainwater and fill the brine, working until dawn, finally making this large salt flat produce an additional 48 tons of sea salt. He was not satisfied with the calluses on his hands; he also wanted to sweat in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism. He often voluntarily, together with the workers, thoroughly exposed his private thoughts in the team's small classroom; in the "one helps one" and "one red pair" activities with the workers, he placed himself in the position of being educated, letting the workers help him, and sweeping away the political dust on him at any time. The workers saw this deputy director's profound changes and praised, "He truly looks like a worker!"

Through the changes of these two cadres going down to the grassroots, the cadres deeply felt that, "Only by replacing the old brine with new brine can good salt be produced; only by overthrowing private thoughts and uprooting revisionist roots can the worldview be thoroughly transformed, and new contributions be made to the people."

In the past two months, a large number of cadres in Piziwo Chemical Factory, taking the workers as their teachers, have undergone painful tempering. Their bureaucratic tendencies, arrogance, and complacency have been eliminated, and their spirits have undergone a great transformation. Their revolutionary enthusiasm has been renewed, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has greatly improved. In the past, cadres were afraid of getting dirty, tired, and suffering when participating in labor. Now, they are covered in mud and brine, pushing salt carts with wide strides. The workers happily said, "Now the cadres have taken root in the teams, sharing meals, housing, salt baskets, and reading the Little Red Book with us, recalling class bitterness together, sweating together, working together, thinking together, and rooting together. This time, we are really at ease."

    劳动改变了干部的精神面貌
    ——皮子窝化工厂科室人员下放劳动的体会
    辽宁皮子窝化工厂革命委员会在精兵简政以后，遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导和广大干部下放劳动的最新指示，组织大批科室干部到班组定员做工人，和工人群众实行“五同”，为机关革命化，干部革命化，密切干群关系提供了一些新的经验。
    接受工人阶级的再教育
    皮子窝化工厂是一个以产盐为主的海水综合利用的化工厂。解放以来，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在这个厂的代理人推行了一条反革命修正主义的政权建设路线，使该厂机构臃肿，人浮于事。仅一九五九年一年的时间，干部就由原来的二百四十五人增加到三百二十一人。有的干部由于长期坐办公室，脱离劳动，脱离群众，变得身懒志衰，甚至有的从工人中提拔起来的干部也变了样，手上的茧子不见了，身上的盐卤气没有了，“官”气越来越浓了。
    今年八月，厂革委会根据毛主席“精兵简政”的教导，大刀阔斧地改革旧机构，把占全体干部百分之七十的二百零六名科室人员下放到一百九十多个班组，在班组定员劳动，与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同搞斗批改。这些干部下班组后，在工人阶级的帮助下，狠触了灵魂，受到了深刻的教育。
    有一位工人出身的原质量检查科副科长，这次回到了原来工作过的化工车间钾洗涤工段参加劳动。一次，班长因公外出，暂时让他把一下质量关。他想，我过去干了多年，提升干部后又读了一些中外有关书籍，怎么也比工人强，顶这个班没啥问题。可是事与愿违，他顶了三个班就有两个班出了废品。这件事深刻地教育了他。
    通过下放劳动，许多干部深有感触地说：
  “下放劳动的道路是毛主席指明的，重新学习的机会是工人群众给的，工人阶级是我们天然的老师，在工人群众面前我们是永远毕不了业的小学生。”
    在艰苦劳动中锤炼自己
    广大干部下放到班组定员做工人，会遇到各种阻力，首先是思想上的阻力。过去少数干部中了中国赫鲁晓夫“入党做官论”的流毒，只想做“官”，不想做普通劳动者。工人们说：“有的人做了官，忘了本，再不好好改造，就要滑到修正主义泥坑啦！”厂革委会针对下放干部的思想状况，首先学习了毛主席关于干部下放劳动防止出修正主义的一系列指示，并且展开革命大批判，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官论”，树立“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的思想。
    下放干部在和工人同吃忆苦饭、同干忆苦活中，受到了很大的教育。老工人李仁祯用过去给滩主抬盐肩膀上压出的一个“包”，痛诉了旧社会的血泪史，在干忆苦活中又用压出的这个“包”，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的谬论，使干部活生生地看到了“走回头路”的苦，激发干部树立起毛主席教导的“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的光辉思想。今天，他们重新抬起大盐筐，心情就不一样了，他们说：“旧社会抬盐筐汗水是流在滩主的盐上，今天抬盐筐却是为社会主义建设贡献力量。”他们从心眼里感到，扁担和盐筐不仅是普通的劳动工具，而且是斗掉官气、反修防修的武器。
    为了使科室人员自觉地把劳动当成锤炼自己的有利条件，厂革委会又组织他们大学毛主席关于艰苦奋斗的教导，大摆脱离劳动的危害，树立为革命吃苦的思想，提高了干部在劳动中狠斗“官”字的自觉性。一次雨夜抢盐，有位干部拉大耙，由于手上沾满了卤，耙杆发滑，一个跟斗摔在盐池里。他想：“要是在机关，哪能吃这场苦。”这个念头刚冒出来，他就用毛主席的广大干部下放劳动的最新指示给顶了回去。他想这个跟斗摔得好，摔掉了一分官架子，增加了一分普通劳动者的本色。他说：“沾了一身卤，赶掉了思想上的‘浑头’。”
    在劳动中为人民立新功
    广大干部下放劳动，关键问题是要斗私批修，只有老老实实接受工人的再教育，彻底改造世界观，才能为人民立新功。
    这个厂有两位曾在一个车间当过正、副主任、这次又下放到同一个班组的干部。他们由于对毛主席广大干部下放劳动的教导认识不同，下去劳动的表现也大不一样。一位生产主任下到班组劳动以后，抱着“应付差事”“大势所趋”的思想，老是没有在班组安家落户的打算，在劳动中的表现是推一推，动一动；在斗私批修中，也是躲躲闪闪。群众气愤地说：“在机关是当官的老爷，到下面来是浪荡公子，没有一点劳动人民的味道！”
    可是，另一位副主任到班组劳动以后，怀着多坚持一分一秒的劳动时间，多给国家产一吨海盐，就是对无产阶级文化大革命作出一分贡献的红心，始终坚守在劳动岗位上。一次，组长因公外出，他主动担负起组长的跑水工作，正好赶上天气预报有大雨。雨前，他连饭都没顾得吃，一直干到深夜十一点多钟，才把一副大滩的卤水一个池子一个池子地圈了起来，等雨刚停，他又跑在泥泞的盐滩上把雨水撤走，把卤水灌满，一直干到天亮，终于使这一大滩多产四十八吨海盐。他不满足手上磨出了几层茧，还要在斗私批修中出几身汗，经常主动地和工人一起，在班组小课堂中彻底地亮私心，斗私心；他在和工人结合“一帮一”“一对红”的活动中，把自己摆在受教育的位置上，让工人进行帮助，随时随地扫掉身上的政治灰尘。广大工人看到这位副主任的深刻变化，都赞扬说：“他真象个工人样！”
    通过这两位下放干部的变化，使广大干部深刻体会到，“撤掉老卤换新卤，才能出好盐；斗倒私心，挖掉修根，彻底改造世界观，才能为人民立新功。”
    两个多月来，皮子窝化工厂大批下放干部拜工人为师，经过痛苦的磨练，官气、娇气、暮气打掉了，精神面貌发生了巨变，革命干劲添了又添，干群关系大改善。过去干部参加劳动怕脏怕累又怕苦，现在身溅烂泥手沾卤，推起盐车迈阔步。工人们高兴地说：
  “如今干部扎根在班组，和我们同吃一锅饭，同住一个屋，同抬一个筐，同读红宝书，同忆阶级苦，汗流在一起，劲使在一起，心想在一起，根扎在一起，这回我们算放心了。”
