	Maintaining the True Colors of the Working Class
	Nanjing Puzhen Vehicle Factory, Liang Bangfu

	I am an ordinary worker in the dismantling workshop. Last November, when the workshop revolutionary committee was established, the revolutionary masses elected me as the deputy director. Although I have become a cadre, I still spend most of my time in the workshop participating in production labor, maintaining close contact with my comrades. They still affectionately call me "Big Liang!"

	In the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest directive: "A large number of cadres should go down to the countryside to labor, which is a good opportunity for them to re-learn. Except for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches."

	Chairman Mao's directive is the greatest concern, the greatest care, and the greatest encouragement for us. Cadres participating in collective production labor, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in labor, is the fundamental way to achieve the thought revolution of cadres, and is a long-term strategy to prevent revisionism.

	In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, making the factory's management organization increasingly bloated and the number of non-production personnel increasingly large. Some people, after becoming cadres, enjoyed special treatment in eating, living, and traveling, and developed the bad habits of the exploiting class of being detached from labor and the masses. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction rose up to rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and seized their power. Since then, we workers have taken control of all power in the factory. I often think that after we revolutionary workers take power, we must always maintain the revolutionary vigor of the proletariat and never take the old road that the capitalist roaders took. I was promoted from an ordinary worker to a cadre, my position changed, but the thoughts and feelings of the working class cannot change, the character of an ordinary laborer cannot change, and the style of close contact with the masses cannot change. I suffer from goiter, and with a lot of work and little rest, my health is not good. Some comrades care about my health and advise me not to participate in labor, but I feel that "a sharp knife will rust if not used, a path will be overgrown if not walked, and a person will become revisionist if not laboring." I have always insisted on participating in production labor and even joined the dirtiest and most labor-intensive rust-removal team.

	When I joined the rust-removal team, the team leader assigned me to windshield rust removal. I knew that this place was not the most labor-intensive for rust removal. After repeatedly requesting the team leader, he assigned me to the car frame rust removal. Although the work here is labor-intensive, I feel very happy. Being with the workers in labor makes it easiest to approach the masses, discover problems in thoughts and production, and discuss and solve problems with the masses. I labored in the rust-removal team for more than a month, and my relationship with the workers became even closer, and we were like brothers, talking about everything. They enthusiastically supported the work of the workshop revolutionary committee, and at the same time, they sincerely pointed out the shortcomings and mistakes in our work, helping us to work better under the supervision of the masses.

	I deeply feel that: wearing work clothes, our words are listened to, our commands are effective, and when we have shortcomings and mistakes, the masses can help correct them in time. I am a worker cadre, lacking experience in work, but I firmly believe that as long as I follow Chairman Mao's instructions on "being both an official and a commoner," never forgetting that I am an ordinary laborer, getting close to the masses, relying on the masses, and blending with the masses, the work of the revolutionary committee will definitely be done better.

    永葆工人阶级的本色
    南京浦镇车辆工厂　梁邦福
    我是解体车间的一个普通工人。去年十一月，车间革命委员会成立时，革命群众选我当了革委会副主任。我虽然当了干部，但大部分时间仍在车间参加生产劳动，同战友们保持着密切联系。他们还是亲切地叫我：“大梁！”
    在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新指示：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”
    毛主席这个指示，是对我们最大的关怀，最大的爱护，最大的鞭策。干部参加集体生产劳动，在劳动中活学活用毛主席著作，是实现干部思想革命化的根本途径，是反修、防修的百年大计。
  过去，中国赫鲁晓夫极力推行反革命修正主义路线，把工厂的管理机构搞得越来越庞大，脱产人员越来越多。有些人当了干部，吃、住、行等都搞特殊化，染上脱离劳动，脱离群众，做官当老爷的剥削阶级坏作风。在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派起来造了党内一小撮走资派的反，夺了他们的权。从此，我们工人阶级掌握了厂里一切大权。我常常这样想，我们革命工人掌权后，一定要永远保持无产阶级朝气勃勃的革命青春，决不走过去走资派走过的那条老路。我由一个普通工人当了干部，地位变了，但工人阶级的思想感情不能变，普通劳动者的本色不能变，紧密联系群众的作风不能变。我患甲状腺肿大症，加上工作多，休息少，身体不好。有的同志关心我的身体健康，劝我不要参加劳动，我却感到“快刀不用要生锈，大路不走草成窝，人不劳动要变修”。我一直坚持参加生产劳动，而且到活最脏最累的除锈工组参加劳动。
    我到了除锈工组，组长把我分配到风挡除锈。我知道这个地方的工作还不是除锈最艰苦的地方。经过我向组长再三要求，他就把我分配到车底架除锈。这个地方工作虽然是艰苦的，但是，我却感到非常愉快。和工人在一起劳动，最容易接近群众，最容易发现思想上、生产上的问题，也最容易和群众商量问题，解决问题。我在除锈工组劳动了一个多月，和工人的关系更加密切了，相互之间亲如兄弟，无所不谈。他们热情地支持车间革委会的工作，同时对我们工作中的缺点、错误也能诚恳地提出批评建议，使我们在群众监督之下更好地工作。
    我深深体会到：穿上工作服，我们说话就有人听，指挥就灵，有了缺点、错误，群众也能及时帮助纠正。我是一个工人干部，工作中缺少经验，但我坚信，只要遵照毛主席关于“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，时刻不忘记自己是一个普通劳动者，深入群众，依靠群众，同群众打成一片，革委会的工作一定会搞得更好。　（新华社）
