The entire Chinese landscape is a sea of red, and our great socialist motherland is becoming increasingly prosperous and flourishing. Amidst this excellent situation, the 1968 Autumn Session of the China Export Commodities Fair opened successfully in Guangzhou as scheduled. This is a great victory for the invincible thought of Mao Zedong and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It has dealt another resounding slap to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and all reactionaries.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the propaganda machines of the Soviet revisionist clique have been spreading rumors and lies day in and day out, repeatedly predicting that the China Export Commodities Fair would not be held. However, the China Export Commodities Fair has been held session after session, presenting new faces, new products, and new trading customs to the people of the world, shattering all the slander of the class enemies.

The Soviet revisionist clique has been cursing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, claiming it "isolates China." Shameful traitors, you are blind! Look! Friends from dozens of countries and regions across the five continents have come to the China Export Commodities Fair, standing in reverence before the statue of our great leader Chairman Mao, with a constant stream of people eagerly taking photos in front of the Mao statue. They long for Beijing, they long for Chairman Mao. Listen! An African youth, risking his life to come to China to participate in the fair, sang "The East Is Red" as soon as he set foot on Chinese soil, passionately shouting, "I love China, I love Mao Zedong!" An Italian friend brought a portrait of Chairman Mao, meticulously drawn by his daughter Gulina, from the distant Mediterranean shore to present to our great leader Chairman Mao. Many Japanese friends shouted thousands of times, "Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" ...

Facts speak louder than words. It is precisely the victory of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the unprecedented consolidation and strengthening of our proletarian dictatorship that make the people of the world love socialist China more and more, and love our great leader Chairman Mao more and more. Therefore, the number of participants in the fair has increased session by session, and they come continuously from all over the world, creating an unprecedented spectacle. Our friends are everywhere. Let the Soviet revisionists curse us for being "isolated"! They are just a few buzzing flies. Shameful traitors, your curses and attacks cannot save you from your impending doom. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great socialist motherland is stronger than ever before, and she will forever stand tall in the East like a giant.

The Soviet revisionist clique has been cursing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, claiming it "disrupted production" and "brought many difficulties to the national economy." Shameful traitors, your calculations are wrong, you are dreaming in broad daylight. Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, revolution is the development of productive forces." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly aroused the enthusiasm of our people, and our people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have promoted production through revolution, fully implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, and resolutely carried out the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" advocated by our great leader Chairman Mao, making our industry, agriculture, and science and technology flourish, providing a solid material foundation for the development and expansion of our foreign trade. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, each session of the China Export Commodities Fair has exhibited more than 30,000 kinds of products, many of which are high-quality, high-level new products designed and manufactured during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the spring session of this year, just four months after the autumn session of last year, a large number of new products were exhibited again.

Now, the 1968 Autumn Session of the China Export Commodities Fair has met with friends from the trade circles of various countries around the world with new mechanical equipment, various new types of cars, new precision instruments, new light industrial products, new patterns and designs of textiles, new handicrafts, and other more abundant and updated contents. There are internationally advanced large-scale precision planing machines, and 200,000-power electron microscopes made by workers and young technicians on the road of self-reliance. This fully demonstrates the great achievements of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

The day of the complete victory of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not far off. Our industry, agriculture, science and technology, revolutionary literature and art, and other fronts are presenting a new leap-forward situation.

Shameful Soviet revisionist traitors, your days are not good. Who doesn't know that a few years ago, you sold tons of gold mined with the blood and sweat of the Soviet people in the London market to beg for American wheat? Who doesn't know that your Minister of Foreign Trade this year ran his legs off, knocking on the doors of Britain, Japan, and other countries, begging for a few dollars from the big monopolists? Who doesn't know that you plundered a large amount of wealth from the people of Eastern Europe to support your privileged class and prop up your facade? Enough, your economy has reached the point of twilight and crisis, and you still insist on pretending to be strong, isn't that laughable?

Soviet revisionist clique and their running dogs, no matter how you lie and curse, it is like a mad dog barking at the sun, and it does not harm the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China in the slightest. As our great teacher Lenin said: "Boasting and lying is moral decay, it inevitably leads to political decay." You have always relied on rumors to live, your doom is destined.

The China Export Commodities Fair will continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to implement the policy of "equality and mutual benefit, mutual exchange of needs" in foreign trade, further develop normal trade relations between our country and various countries and regions in the world, and make our due contributions to supporting the just struggles of the people of the world.

    气死苏修造谣专家

    在全国山河一片红，我们伟大的社会主义祖国日益繁荣昌盛的一派大好形势下，一九六八年秋季中国出口商品交易会如期胜利地在广州开幕了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。它给了美帝、苏修以及一切反动派又一记响亮的耳光。
    自从无产阶级文化大革命以来，苏修叛徒集团的宣传机器，整天造谣撒谎，一次又一次地预言中国出口商品交易会开不成。然而，中国出口商品交易会一届又一届地以新面貌、新产品、新贸易风尚展现在世界人民面前，粉碎了阶级敌人的一切谰言。
    苏修叛徒集团成天在叫骂无产阶级文化大革命“使中国孤立”。可耻的叛徒，你们是瞎了眼。看！来自世界五大洲的几十个国家和地区的许多朋友，他们以崇敬的心情走进中国出口商品交易会大厅，久久仰望着我们伟大领袖毛主席的塑像，川流不息的人群争先恐后地在毛主席雕像前摄影留念。他们向往着北京，向往着毛主席。听！一位冒着生命危险来到中国参加交易会的非洲青年朋友，一踏上中国国土，学会了唱《东方红》时，热情地高呼：“我爱中国，我爱毛泽东！”一位意大利朋友从遥远的地中海滨，带来了他女儿古丽娜精心绘制的一幅毛主席像，献给我们伟大的领袖毛主席。许多日本朋友千遍万遍地高呼：“祝愿中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”……
    事实胜于雄辩。正是我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，我国的无产阶级专政空前巩固、空前强大，使全世界人民更加热爱社会主义中国，更加热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席。因此，参加交易会的人一届比一届多，他们源源不断地从世界各地来到中国，盛况空前。我们的朋友遍天下。让苏修去骂我们“孤立”吧！这只不过是几只嗡嗡叫的苍蝇。可耻的叛徒，谩骂攻击挽救不了你们即将灭亡的命运。经过无产阶级文化大革命，我们伟大的社会主义祖国，比以往任何时候都更加强大，她将永远象巨人般地屹立在世界的东方。
    苏修叛徒集团不停地诅咒着中国的无产阶级文化大革命“破坏了生产”，“给国家经济带来了许多困难”。可耻的叛徒，你们的如意算盘打错了，你们是白日作梦。伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。”无产阶级文化大革命极大地激发了我国人民的积极性，用毛泽东思想武装的我国人民以革命带动生产，全面落实毛主席的指示，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使我国工业、农业、科学技术欣欣向荣，为发展和扩大我国的对外贸易提供了雄厚的物质基础。从无产阶级文化大革命以来，每届中国出口商品交易会都要展出三万多种产品，许多高质量、高水平的新产品，都是在无产阶级文化大革命中设计制造成功的。今年春季交易会在去年秋季交易会闭幕后的短短四个月，就又展出了大量的新产品。
    现在，一九六八年秋季出口商品交易会又以新的机械设备，各种新型汽车，新的精密仪器，新的轻工业品，新的花型图案的纺织品，新的工艺美术品等等更新更丰富的内容，同世界各地贸易界的朋友们见面了。这里有国际先进水平的精密大型平面磨床，有工人和青年技术人员走自力更生道路制成的二十万倍电子显微镜等等。这充分显示了我国无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命取得全面胜利的日子已经不远了。我国的工业、农业、科学技术、革命文艺等各个战线正在出现新的跃进局面。
    可耻的苏修叛徒们，你们的日子却很不好过。谁不知道，前几年你们把苏联劳动人民用血汗采掘的黄金，成吨成吨地在伦敦市场上抛售，以乞求美国的小麦？谁不知道，你们的对外贸易部长今年跑断了腿，到英国、日本等等国家，挨门挨户地跪在大垄断资本家面前求得几块美元？谁不知道，你们从东欧人民那里掠夺了大量的财富，供你们的特权阶层挥霍，支撑你们的门面？够了，你们的经济已经到了日暮途穷，危机四伏的地步，还硬要打肿了脸充胖子，岂不令人发笑？！
    苏修叛徒集团及其走狗们，不管你们怎么撒谎、咒骂，只不过是狂犬吠日，丝毫无损于中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果。正如伟大导师列宁所说的：“吹牛撒谎是道义上的灭亡，它势必引向政治上的灭亡。”你们一直靠造谣过日子，你们灭亡的命运是注定了的。
    中国出口商品交易会将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续贯彻“平等互利，互通有无”的对外贸易政策，进一步发展我国同世界各国和各地区的正常贸易往来，为支援世界人民的正义斗争做出我们应有的贡献。
