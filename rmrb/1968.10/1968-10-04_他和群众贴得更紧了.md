Zhang Zili, a Red Guard from Jiaozuo No. 11 Middle School and a standing committee member of the school's Revolutionary Committee, has changed recently. He avoids people and speaks less. This situation has caught the attention of the workers' propaganda team.

In the past few days, the school has been bustling with activity. Students have responded to Chairman Mao's great call, expressing their resolutions and oaths to firmly walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants. Zhang Zili has always been at the forefront of these activities, sometimes so busy that he has no time to rest. Why has he suddenly changed? The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team decided to find the root cause.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," the worker comrades started a conversation with Zhang Zili.

The young Zhang Zili was deeply moved when he saw the workers' propaganda team members coming to talk to him. He opened up about his inner turmoil.

It turned out that in recent days, a few students had said that Zhang Zili had "forgotten his comrades who have weathered storms together" and "did not consider the feelings of his old comrades" in the matter of going up to the mountains and down to the countryside. Although Zhang Zili thought their opinions were wrong, he did not dare to sharply point this out, fearing that he might "alienate the masses."

After learning about Zhang Zili's thoughts, the workers' propaganda team members believed that this young man had a knot in his mind, and the problem was not that he was afraid of alienating the masses. This problem reflected Zhang Zili's lack of consistent revolutionary thoroughness in implementing and executing the latest instructions, which was a remnant of the poisonous influence of the old school's revisionist educational line. They must patiently help him raise his awareness and correct his mistakes. Therefore, the workers' propaganda team members enthusiastically and patiently talked with Zhang Zili and studied together Chairman Mao's teachings on "the countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things." They repeatedly understood its profound significance. Then, the workers' propaganda team members pointed out sharply: "Implementing Chairman Mao's instructions does not involve the issue of considering or not considering others; all matters should be done according to Chairman Mao's words, this is our highest principle." "Mobilizing comrades to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside is precisely upholding the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. Doing so will not only prevent alienation from the masses but will make one closer to the masses."

A ship navigates the sea with a helmsman; revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Under the help of the workers' propaganda team, Zhang Zili resolved his inner turmoil. The next day, people saw him discussing the significance of going up to the mountains and down to the countryside with his "comrades who have weathered storms together," clearly stating his opinions and boldly expressing his views. On Chairman Mao's revolutionary path, he is closely united with the masses.

    他和群众贴得更紧了
    河南焦作十一中红卫兵小将、校革委会常委张自力，这几天突然变了。见了人躲躲闪闪，很少说话。这个情况引起了工人宣传队同志的注意。
    这两天，学校里热气腾腾，同学们响应毛主席的伟大号召，纷纷表决心，立誓言，坚决走与工农相结合的道路。在这些活动中，张自力一直走在前面，有时忙得顾不上休息。为什么突然起了变化呢？工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志决定寻一寻根源。
    按照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，工人同志同张自力攀谈起来。
    年青的张自力看见工人宣传队的同志来找他，心里十分感动。他谈出了自己思想上的疙瘩。
    原来，这几天学生中有少数人说，张自力在上山下乡的问题上“忘记了风雨同舟的战友”“一点不照顾老战友”，张自力听到这些话后，虽然认为他们的意见是错误的，但不敢尖锐地提出来，怕弄不好要“脱离了群众”。
    工人宣传队的同志了解到张自力这些活思想后，认为：这个青年人思想上结了疙瘩，问题并不在于他自己所说的“怕脱离群众”。这个问题反映了张自力贯彻和执行最新指示还缺乏始终如一的革命彻底性，这是旧学校修正主义教育路线留给他的遗毒，必须耐心地帮助他提高认识，使他改正过来。于是，工人宣传队的同志便热情耐心地和张自力谈心，并和他一起学习了毛主席关于“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”教导，反复领会它的深远意义。接着，工人宣传队的同志就尖锐地指出：“执行毛主席的指示，不存在什么照顾不照顾的问题，一切事情都要遵照毛主席的话去做，这就是我们的最高原则。”“动员战友上山下乡，这恰恰是坚持了毛泽东思想的原则，这样做，不但不会脱离群众，反而会跟群众贴得更紧。”
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。张自力在工人宣传队的帮助下，解除了思想疙瘩。第二天，人们又看见他和“风雨同舟”的战友，一起讨论上山下乡的意义，旗帜鲜明地争论着问题，发表着自己的意见。在毛主席的革命路线上，他和群众紧紧地结合在一起了。
