Following Chairman Mao's instructions that "the main issue in educational reform is the teachers," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shuanghe Commune have been earnestly re-educating the teachers. Under the guidance and help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, many teachers are striving to change their worldview, reform their old ways, and embark on the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Wuhan on the 24th, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shuanghe Commune in Zao Yang County, Hubei Province, have closely united with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, using Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive" and his latest instructions on carrying out the proletarian educational revolution as weapons. They have smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, led and managed the schools, and made the rural educational revolution vibrant and lively. In the past, the teaching staff of Shuanghe Commune included some who had been teachers or principals in the old society, as well as those who had gone from home to school and back to school again, the so-called "new three doors." They were detached from reality, detached from labor, and detached from the workers and peasants, and could not put down their intellectual airs. After the poor and lower-middle peasants took direct control of the schools, they paid great attention to re-educating the teaching staff. Their approach was to use Chairman Mao's works as textbooks, use the great criticism as a driving force, use the various activities of the production teams as classrooms, and use the poor and lower-middle peasants as teachers to enthusiastically re-educate them. To help teachers change their worldview through labor, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the communes and production teams, on the one hand, specially allocated production bases for the schools, allowing teachers to participate in labor at the school; on the other hand, they assigned them to production teams and regularly returned to the teams to work with the students. The teachers consciously regarded participating in labor as a compulsory course in receiving re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, going to work early every morning and then teaching classes after finishing the morning work. The poor and lower-middle peasants also often gave the teachers classes on class education and organized them to participate in the class struggle and class education activities of the production teams. Under the enthusiastic help and education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the teachers changed their past "three detaches" lifestyle of "teaching, entering and exiting the school gate, and never taking off their shoes and socks." They went to work as commune members and taught classes as teachers, embarking on the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

The poor and lower-middle peasants also selected cultured young commune members from the production teams to serve as school teachers, changing the composition of the teaching staff. Since April this year, the educational revolution leadership group of the communes and production teams has selected 29 teachers from the cultured farmers of the production teams. Most of them come from poor and lower-middle peasant families, have a high school education, have been farmers for three to four or seven to eight years, some are production team cadres, and there are also tractor drivers. They have deep class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants and are most welcome by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The son of a poor peasant, Wang Daqi, a primary school teacher in Kanghe Brigade, always thinks for the poor and lower-middle peasants. When some commune members' children have no one to take care of them at home, he asks the students to bring their younger siblings to school. He often holds a child in one hand and writes on the blackboard with the other. When the child falls asleep, he puts them on his own bed. The poor and lower-middle peasants praise him as a trusted person of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now, this batch of new teachers has become the backbone of the teaching staff of Shuanghe Commune.

The educational revolution leadership group of Shuanghe Commune also hired many old poor peasants with rich experience in class struggle and production struggle to co-teach classes on class education; invited revolutionary cadres of the communes and production teams to teach political classes; invited old farmers, livestock keepers, forestry managers, carpenters, accountants, and tractor drivers with production experience to teach production labor classes or agricultural science classes; invited militia platoon leaders and demobilized soldiers to teach military and physical education classes. After they stepped onto the podium, they closely integrated the teaching content with the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside, making the teaching methods lively, specific, and popular, setting a good example for the teachers.

    遵照毛主席关于“教改的问题，主要是教员问题”的教导
    双河公社贫下中农认真对教师进行再教育
    许多教师在贫下中农的帮助和教育下，努力改造世界观，改变旧作风，踏上了与工农相结合的道路
    据新华社武汉二十四日电　湖北省枣阳县双河公社的贫下中农，紧密团结广大革命师生，以毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示和关于实现无产阶级教育革命的一系列最新指示为武器，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，领导和管理学校，把农村的教育革命搞得有声有色。过去，双河公社的教师队伍，有的是在旧社会就当老师、任校长的“老教育”，有的是从家门进校门又入校门的“新三门”。他们脱离实际，脱离劳动，脱离工农群众，放不下知识分子的架子。贫下中农直接管理学校后，很重视对教师队伍进行再教育。他们的做法是：以毛主席著作为教材，以大批判为动力，以生产队各种活动为课堂，以贫下中农为老师，热情对他们进行再教育。为了通过劳动帮助教师改造自己的世界观，社队贫下中农一方面专门为学校拨出生产基地，让教师在学校参加劳动；同时，把他们分划到生产队，定期和学生一起回队劳动。老师们自觉地把参加劳动当成接受贫下中农再教育的必学课程，每天一早就出工，出完早工后再上课。贫下中农还经常给教师们上阶级教育课，组织他们参加生产队的阶级斗争和阶级教育的活动。在贫下中农的热情帮助和教育下，教师们改变了过去那种“教学教学，校门进出，鞋袜不离脚”的“三脱离”生活，出工是社员，上课是老师，踏上了与工农相结合的道路。
    贫下中农还从生产队中选拔有文化的青年社员担任学校教师，改变教师队伍的成份。今年四月以来，社队教育革命领导小组从生产队有文化的农民中选拔了二十九名教师，他们大都出身于贫下中农，具有中学程度，当过三四年到七八年农民，有的是生产队干部，还有农机手。他们和贫下中农有深厚的阶级感情，最受贫下中农欢迎。贫农的儿子、康河大队小学教师王大起，处处为贫下中农着想。有的社员家里大人出工，小孩没人带，他就叫学生把弟、妹带到学校来。他经常一手抱着孩子，一手在黑板上写字。孩子睡了就放在自己的床上。贫下中农称赞他是贫下中农的贴心人。现在，这批新教师已经成为双河公社教师队伍中的骨干力量。
    双河公社教育革命领导小组还聘请了许多具有丰富的阶级斗争和生产斗争经验的老贫农兼任老师，登上讲台讲阶级教育课；请社队革命干部讲政治课；请有生产经验的老农、饲养员、林场场长、木工、会计、农机手等讲生产劳动课或农业常识课；请民兵连长、转业军人讲军事体育课。他们登上讲台后，把教学内容同农村三大革命运动紧密结合起来，教学方法生动、具体、通俗，给教师树立了良好的榜样。
