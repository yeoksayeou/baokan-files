	Silver Coins and Coconut Water
	Beijing Knitting Factory Worker, Wang Lanfen

	During the second phase of the Chinese Civil War, on the tormented island of Hainan, a peasant girl named Wu Qinghua, in her struggle against the tyranny and oppression of the landlord Nan Batian, kicked the lackey to the ground in anger and fled. Unfortunately, she fell back into Nan Batian's clutches, was beaten unconscious, and left to die in the wilderness. Just as Wu Qinghua's life hung in the balance, the party representative of the Women's Detachment, Hong Changqing, saved her and guided her to join the revolutionary base, joining the Women's Detachment. Before leaving, Hong Changqing also gave her all the silver coins he had on him as travel expenses. Wu Qinghua, this poor girl with deep hatred, received such warm care for the first time in her life, and suddenly felt a surge of warmth throughout her body, tears welling up in her eyes.

	The revolutionary base was bathed in sunshine, with red flags flying. The soldiers of the Women's Detachment and the villagers were engaged in intense combat training. Wu Qinghua rushed to the field and was warmly welcomed by the soldiers and villagers. The commander of the Women's Detachment brought her a bowl of refreshing coconut water. Wu Qinghua, holding the sweet and fragrant coconut water, looked into the warm and sincere eyes around her, and felt a surge of class love coursing through her body. Wu Qinghua was once again moved to tears.

	Watching these two scenes from "Red Detachment of Women," my heart could not calm down for a long time. Silver coins, silver coins, they are not ordinary money; coconut water, coconut water, it is not ordinary water. They contain such deep proletarian feelings, such sublime revolutionary sentiments. This class love, this revolutionary sentiment, inspired Wu Qinghua to bravely fight against the enemy; it educated Wu Qinghua not to forget the bitterness of her class, to remember the blood and tears of her past, so that all the laboring people in the world can be liberated.

	A handful of bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" and modern revisionists slander us, saying that the proletariat "has no feelings," and curse our revolutionary art as "dry and boring." This is pure nonsense. The two vivid and realistic details in the revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women" are a powerful refutation of their lies. Our revolutionary art is not only full of emotion but also profound and enduring. The emotion expressed in our revolutionary art is the emotion of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the emotion of the proletariat.

    银毫子与椰子水
    北京针织总厂女工　王兰芬
    我国第二次国内革命战争时期，在苦难深重的海南岛，贫农的女儿吴清华，为了反抗恶霸地主南霸天的欺凌和迫害，愤怒地将狗腿子踢倒在地，夺门逃走。但不幸又落入南霸天的魔掌，被打得昏死过去，丢在荒郊。就在吴清华生命危急的时刻，娘子军的党代表洪常青救了她，并指引她投奔革命根据地，参加娘子军。临行时，洪常青还把身上仅有的几个银毫子全部送给她作路费。吴清华这个苦大仇深的穷丫头，有生以来第一次得到这样亲切的关怀，顿时浑身充满了温暖，激动得热泪盈眶。
    革命根据地阳光灿烂，红旗飘扬，娘子军连的战士和乡亲们正在进行紧张的战斗训练。吴清华赶到操场，受到战士和乡亲们的热烈欢迎。娘子军连长端来一碗清凉的椰子水送给吴清华。吴清华手捧甜丝丝、香喷喷的椰子水，眼望一双双亲切、真挚的眼睛，一股阶级友爱的暖流通遍全身。吴清华又激动得流下了眼泪。
    看了《红色娘子军》中这两个情节，我的心情久久不能平静。银毫子啊银毫子，它可不是普通的钱；椰子水啊椰子水，它可不是平凡的水。它们蕴藏着多么深厚的无产阶级感情，蕴藏着多么崇高的革命情谊。这阶级的友爱，革命的情谊，鼓舞吴清华勇敢地去和敌人作斗争；教育吴清华不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，使普天下的劳动人民都获得解放。
    一小撮资产阶级反动学术“权威”和现代修正主义者，诬蔑我们无产阶级“没有感情”，咒骂我们革命的文艺“枯燥无味”，这纯粹是胡说八道。革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》中这两个真实生动的细节，对他们的谰言就是一个有力的驳斥。我们革命的文艺不仅有情，而且是情深意长。我们革命的文艺所抒的是工农兵之情，是无产阶级之情。
