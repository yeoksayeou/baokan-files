Italian workers are taking to the streets and striking in many cities to demand better working and living conditions and to protest against the brutal exploitation by capitalists.

On the 16th, over ten thousand agricultural and industrial workers from the entire Calabria region in southern Italy, along with many university and high school students, held a march and demonstration in Cosenza. They demanded full employment and wage increases. The demonstrators waved many red flags and banners with slogans such as, “Workers and students unite to oppose the bourgeois regime!” and “Power to the working class!” Some in the marching crowd held banners with their wishes: Long live Chairman Mao! Some also held up Chairman Mao’s quotations.

After a long march, the demonstrators held a rally. At the rally, workers took turns speaking, denouncing the oppression and exploitation by capitalists and the government. The police brutally attacked the demonstrators, throwing tear gas and beating them with batons. The demonstrators fought back bravely with stones and sticks.

Due to the continuous layoffs by the Italian monopolistic bourgeoisie to intensify exploitation, the number of agricultural workers in the Calabria region has decreased by more than 50% compared to 1951, and the number of industrial workers has decreased by nearly 15%. The number of unemployed people is increasing, and workers’ lives are becoming more difficult.

On the 16th, demonstrations and marches were also held in other cities such as Venice, Palermo, and Pisa to protest against the exploitation of workers by capitalists and the police’s violent suppression of workers’ struggles. In the central Italian city of Latina, 40,000 industrial workers began a 48-hour general strike on the 16th to demand wage increases. In Turin, the strike by workers at the Lancia automobile factory has entered its seventh day, and they have bravely fought against the police.

Recently, 2,000 glass factory workers in Pisa, Tuscany, went on strike to protest the unjustified layoff of over 400 workers by the management.

The striking workers set up barricades outside the factory in the morning of the 15th, blocking traffic to the factory and continuing their strike. The workers’ just struggle received the support of many university students.

The reactionary Italian authorities dispatched hundreds of police to sabotage the strike. The police fired tear gas at the workers in an attempt to remove the barricades. However, the workers and university students, undeterred by the violence, bravely fought back against the police and repelled their multiple attacks.

    反对资本家残酷剥削　争取改善工作和生活条件
    意大利劳动人民纷纷示威和罢工
    示威者高举“工人和学生团结起来反对资产阶级政权！”“政权归于工人阶级！”等标语牌
    据新华社十八日讯　罗马消息：意大利劳动人民不顾反动当局的野蛮镇压，最近在许多城市举行示威和罢工斗争，要求改善工作和生活条件，抗议资本家对他们的残酷剥削。
    十六日，来自意大利南部整个加拉布里亚区的一万多名农业和工业工人，和许多大学生和中学生一起，在科森萨举行游行示威，要求充分就业，增加工资。示威者高举许多红旗和标语牌，标语牌上的口号有：“工人和学生团结起来反对资产阶级政权！”“政权归于工人阶级！”游行队伍中，有些群众高举的标语牌上写着他们的祝愿：祝毛主席万寿无疆！有些群众还高举毛主席语录牌。
    在经过长时间的游行后，示威群众举行了大会。在会上，工人们相继发表讲话，谴责资本家和政府对他们的压迫和剥削。警察对示威群众进行了野蛮的袭击，他们向示威者扔催泪弹，并用棍棒打人。示威者用石块和木棒英勇还击。
    由于意大利垄断资产阶级不断解雇工人以加强剥削，加拉布里亚区目前的农业就业人数比一九五一年减少了百分之五十以上，工业就业人数下降了将近百分之十五，失业人数不断增加，工人的生活日益困苦。
    在威尼斯、巴勒摩、彼萨等其他城市，十六日也分别举行了游行示威，抗议资本家对工人的剥削和警察镇压工人斗争的暴行。在意大利中部的拉蒂纳市的四万名产业工人，十六日开始举行四十八小时总罢工，要求增加工资。在都灵，“兰查”汽车制造厂工人的罢工斗争已经进入第七天，他们同警察进行了英勇斗争。
    意大利中部杜斯卡纳区彼萨市两千名玻璃制造工人，最近举行罢工，抗议资方无理解雇四百多名工人。
    罢工工人十五日上午在工厂外面筑起路障，断绝了工厂的交通，坚持罢工斗争。工人的正义斗争得到了许多大学生的支持。
    意大利反动当局出动数百名警察，阴谋破坏罢工，警察向工人施放催泪弹，企图拆除路障。但是，工人和大学生不畏强暴，同警察进行了英勇搏斗，打退了警察的多次进攻。
