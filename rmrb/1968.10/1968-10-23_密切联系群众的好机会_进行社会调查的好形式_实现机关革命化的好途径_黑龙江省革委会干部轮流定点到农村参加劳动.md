Cadre of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee Take Turns to Work in the Countryside

Cadre who participate in labor live, eat, work, study, and fight alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, respectfully learning from them. They have established deep class feelings and their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Harbin on the 22nd: The cadre of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "the necessity to maintain the system of cadre participation in collective production labor," have been going in batches to the countryside to participate in collective production labor. They have been fighting alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. This has greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of in-service cadre and the revolutionization of the organs. Cadre who have gone to the countryside to participate in fixed-point labor have deeply felt that cadre directly going to the countryside to participate in fixed-point labor and receiving re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants is an excellent opportunity for the new revolutionary committee's staff to maintain close ties with the masses, a good form for conducting social surveys, and a good pathway to achieve the revolutionization of the organs.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee began implementing the system of cadre fixed-point labor in May of this year. By now, more than half of the cadre have gone in six batches to the Double Prosperity Production Brigade of the Five Constant County Double Prosperity People's Commune to participate in fixed-point labor. Some have already gone down twice.

Cadre who go to the grassroots to participate in fixed-point labor live, eat, work, study, and fight alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants. They respectfully learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants and quickly establish deep class feelings. Their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. An old revolutionary cadre who participated in the land reform said: "When I first came to the city, I still had the smell of the poor and lower-middle peasants on me. After living in high-rise buildings for a long time, I have picked up some bad habits. This time, sitting on the poor and lower-middle peasants' kang, eating home-cooked meals, holding a sickle and hoe, I have shed my officialdom and laziness, regained my vigor, changed my feelings. Truly, class struggle consciousness cannot be weakened, line struggle awareness cannot be lowered, ideological transformation cannot be relaxed, proletarian feelings cannot be changed, labor participation cannot be lazy, the pursuit of enjoyment is not allowed, peaceful evolution is not allowed, and the poor and lower-middle peasants cannot be forgotten." Some cadre who went from the home gate to the school gate and then to the organ gate, after laboring alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, deeply felt: "The countryside is a big bath. Wash with the sweat of labor, and the body feels light; there is the freshest oxygen among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Go there to breathe, and the mind becomes clear." A female cadre who had once been a worker thought that since she was neither a leading cadre nor a "three-door" cadre, she seemed to have no problem with participating in production labor and transforming her thoughts. However, after going to the countryside to participate in labor, she found that there was a big gap between her thoughts and those of the poor and lower-middle peasants. She said: "The closer you get to the poor and lower-middle peasants, the deeper your understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Truly, you cannot neglect labor for a moment, and you cannot forget to connect with the masses for a moment."

The cadre participating in fixed-point labor have changed in batches, but their spirit of learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants has not changed, their attitude of not being afraid of dirt and hard work has not changed, their working style of not being afraid of hardship has not changed, and their determination to transform their thoughts has not changed. The poor and lower-middle peasants see that these cadre have hearts connected with them and are very happy. They are willing to share their innermost thoughts and important matters with them, and they have formed a deep bond. Every time a batch of comrades comes to the point, the poor and lower-middle peasants welcome them to the door and say warmly: "You can stay a few more days!" Every time a batch of comrades leaves, the poor and lower-middle peasants hold their hands tightly and say emotionally: "You can come again!"

These cadre participate in collective production labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants, thus being able to timely hear the voices and demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants and timely grasp the new trends, characteristics, and problems of class struggle in the locality. In this way, they turn the labor point into a point for conducting social surveys. The new situations and experiences summarized from the point are very beneficial for guiding the overall work. The Double Prosperity Brigade was originally a weak brigade in the Double Prosperity People's Commune, with sharp and complex class struggles, and revolution and production could not be advanced. Cadre who came here to participate in labor went deep into the front lines of class struggle and production struggle, conducted in-depth and detailed investigations and research, and helped this brigade quickly uncover the cover of class struggle, severely strike the class enemies, and make the brigade's revolution and production present a great situation. The changes in the Double Prosperity Brigade have greatly promoted the surrounding brigades. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Double Prosperity has leaped to the front, we must catch up tightly." Cadre who participated in labor here said: "There are active factors in the weak brigades, and there are advanced individuals, advanced thoughts, and advanced experiences. As long as you labor and fight alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, grasp the key of class struggle, and arm the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, weak brigades can quickly become advanced brigades." At the same time, the Revolutionary Committee cadre, through labor and investigation and research, gain sensory knowledge of class struggle and production struggle, and when studying problems and guiding work, they can also make the situation clear, have great determination, and have the right methods. A cadre who participated in fixed-point labor participated in drafting a report on how to change the face of weak brigades in the entire province. He deeply felt: "In the past, writing reports in the tall building only sought the leader's approval without asking about the situation below. This time, going deep into the grassroots and directly relying on the masses, I have a deep personal experience of the problems existing in weak brigades and how to change the face of weak brigades. The problems proposed in the report are targeted."

Chairman Mao teaches: "The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." The Revolutionary Committee cadre go in batches to the countryside to participate in production labor, bringing back the good thoughts, good style, good qualities, and good traditions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, especially bringing back the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice, which has become the driving force for the revolutionization of the organ's work. Originally, the comrades in charge of receiving letters and visits from the masses sometimes did not treat the visiting masses warmly and patiently. After these comrades returned from labor in the countryside, their style changed greatly, and their enthusiasm doubled. When receiving visits from the masses, they always show the spirit of being extremely responsible to the people and to the work. They would rather not sleep or eat than fail to warmly receive the masses whenever they come to visit. Sometimes, they work until late at night and still send the visiting masses to the station or to a distant residence. Some visiting masses said gratefully: "The new Revolutionary Committee is truly serving us poor and lower-middle peasants. You are indeed good cadre taught by Chairman Mao." The organ cadre of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, because they actively promote ideological revolutionization, under the condition of heavy work and few people, not only continuously send cadre to the grassroots to participate in fixed-point labor, but also complete various tasks very well. After the issuance of Chairman Mao's instructions on "in-service cadre should also go down in batches to labor," they have grasped and implemented it even more resolutely. Comrades who have not participated in fixed-point labor firmly request to go to the grassroots to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants; comrades who have participated in fixed-point labor strongly request to participate in the second batch; comrades who stay in the organ to work are determined to exert greater revolutionary enthusiasm and complete various tasks even better.

    密切联系群众的好机会　进行社会调查的好形式　实现机关革命化的好途径
    黑龙江省革委会干部轮流定点到农村参加劳动
    参加劳动的干部，同贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗，恭恭敬敬地向贫下中农学习，同贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情，精神面貌发生深刻变化
    新华社哈尔滨二十二日电　黑龙江省革命委员会政治委员会的干部，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度”的教导，分批分期轮流定点到农村参加集体生产劳动，同贫下中农一起参加阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，有力地促进了在职干部的思想革命化和机关革命化。到农村参加过定点劳动的干部深有体会地说：干部直接到农村参加定点劳动，接受贫下中农的再教育，是新生的革命委员会的工作人员密切联系群众的好机会，进行社会调查的好形式，实现机关革命化的好途径。
    黑龙江省革命委员会政治委员会，从今年五月份开始实行干部定点劳动的制度，到现在已有半数以上的干部先后分六批到五常县双兴公社兴胜大队参加过定点劳动，有的人已经下去参加了两次劳动。
    到基层参加定点劳动的干部，同贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗，恭恭敬敬向贫下中农学习，很快同贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情，精神面貌发生了深刻变化。一个参加过土改的革命老干部说：“刚进城时还带一身贫下中农的泥土气，高楼大厦住久了，染得一身坏习气。这次又往贫下中农炕头一坐，家常便饭一吃，镰刀锄头一拿，官气丢了，暮气走了，朝气有了，感情变了。真是阶级斗争观念淡不得，路线斗争觉悟低不得，思想改造松不得，无产阶级感情变不得，参加劳动懒不得，追求享受要不得，和平演变了不得，贫下中农忘不得。”一些从家门到学校门，又到机关门的“三门”干部，同贫下中农一起参加劳动后，深有体会地说：“农村是个大澡塘，用劳动的汗水冲洗一下，身上就轻松了；贫下中农中间有最新鲜的氧气，到那里去呼吸一下，头脑就清醒了。”一个曾经当过工人的女干部，过去认为自己既不是领导干部，又不是“三门”干部，似乎不存在参加生产劳动和改造思想的问题。可是这次到农村参加劳动之后，发现自己思想与贫下中农的差距很大。她说：“靠贫下中农越近，对毛主席的革命路线理解越深。真是参加劳动一刻也忽视不得，联系群众一刻也忘不得。”
    参加定点劳动的干部，换了一批又一批，但是他们向贫下中农学习的精神没有变，不嫌脏累的劳动态度没有变，不辞辛苦的工作作风没有变，改造思想的决心没有变。贫下中农看到这些干部同他们心连心，非常高兴。有什么知心话都肯同他们讲，有什么要紧事都愿找他们商量，彼此结成了鱼水之情。每当一批同志进点时，贫下中农就把他们迎上门，亲切地说：“你们可多呆几天啊！”每当一批同志离开时，贫下中农紧握他们的手，深情地说：“你们可再来啊！”
    这些干部同贫下中农一起参加集体生产劳动，可以及时地听到贫下中农的呼声和要求，及时地掌握当地阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题。这样，他们就把劳动的点，变成了从事社会调查的点。从点上获得的新情况，总结的新经验，对指导全面很有好处。兴胜大队原是双兴公社中的一个薄弱队，阶级斗争尖锐复杂，革命和生产一直上不去。来这里参加劳动的干部，深入阶级斗争和生产斗争第一线，进行深入细致的调查研究，帮助这个队很快揭开阶级斗争盖子，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人，使这个大队的革命和生产出现一片大好形势。兴胜大队的变化，对周围的大队促进很大，许多贫下中农表示：兴胜跃到前边去了，我们要紧紧跟上。在这里参加劳动的干部说：薄弱队里存在着积极因素，这里孕育着先进人物、先进思想、先进经验。只要和贫下中农劳动在一起，战斗在一起，抓住阶级斗争这个纲，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，薄弱队可以很快变成先进队。同时，革委会干部在劳动中从事调查研究，获得阶级斗争和生产斗争的感性知识，研究问题、指导工作时，也就能做到情况明、决心大、方法对。一个参加定点劳动的干部，参加了起草关于全省如何改变薄弱队面貌的报告，他深有体会地说：“过去蹲在大楼里写报告，只讨领导点头不问下情。这次深入基层直接依靠群众，对薄弱队存在的问题以及如何改变薄弱队的面貌有了切身体会，报告中提出的问题做到了有的放矢。”
    毛主席教导说：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”革委会的干部分批到农村参加生产劳动，带回了贫下中农的好思想、好作风、好品质、好传统，特别是带回了理论联系实际的革命学风，成为机关工作革命化的动力。原来负责接待群众来信来访工作的同志，对待来访的群众有时不热情不耐心。这些同志从农村劳动回来后，作风大变，干劲倍增，在接待群众来访时，处处表现出对人民对工作极端负责的精神。他们宁可不睡觉、不吃饭，也要做到群众什么时候来访，就在什么时候热情接待。有时，他们工作到深夜，还要把来访的群众送到车站，或者送到很远的住所。有的来访群众感激地说：“新生的革命委员会真是为咱贫下中农服务的，你们不愧是毛主席教导的好干部。”黑龙江省革命委员会政治委员会的机关干部，由于积极搞好思想革命化，所以在工作重、人员少的情况下，不仅连续抽出干部下基层参加定点劳动，而且各项工作完成得很好。毛主席关于“在职干部也应分批下放劳动”的指示发表后，他们更加狠抓落实，坚决照办。未参加定点劳动的同志，坚决要求下基层接受贫下中农的再教育；已经参加过定点劳动的同志，又强烈要求参加第二期；留在机关工作的同志，决心发挥更大的革命干劲，把各项工作完成得更好。
