The Paris talks between Vietnam and the U.S. officially began on May 13. So far, the two sides have held 26 formal meetings.

According to recent reports from U.S. and other Western news agencies and newspapers, the head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, is currently preparing to throw out a grand deception and trick of "completely stopping the bombing of North Vietnam."

A United Press International dispatch from Paris says that the Paris talks "have entered a delicate phase," and "there are increasingly more signs that" the stalemate in the Paris talks may be broken. "This breakthrough may take the form of the U.S. completely stopping the bombing." Reuters from Paris reports that the talks "are shifting from the main military issue—Hanoi's demand that the U.S. stop bombing its territory—to political issues."

According to a report by Associated Press correspondent Heitow from Washington, the U.S. has been pushing a so-called "package plan" in the "Paris talks." According to this "package plan," the U.S. demands that North Vietnam "exercise some degree of restraint" in military actions. United Press International correspondent Hansley mentioned that the U.S. has secretly proposed a "three-point plan" for a "complete stop of bombing" in Paris. The contents of this "three-point plan" include demanding that the "Vietnam side" withdraw its troops from the demilitarized zone, stop all terrorist activities and attacks on South Vietnamese cities, and agree to let the Saigon government participate in expanded talks.

According to an Associated Press report from Saigon on the 16th, the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, Bunker, and the South Vietnamese puppet leader Thieu "hurriedly held three meetings" that day. "A government official told reporters to pay attention to the possibility of simultaneous statements about the bombing issue from Washington and Saigon." Agence France-Presse from Saigon reported that "after the meeting between Bunker and Thieu, news that the U.S. is preparing to order a complete stop to the bombing of North Vietnam spread like wildfire throughout Saigon."

According to Agence France-Presse, Johnson "taking this action will make many undecided Democratic voters swing to Humphrey's camp."

United Press International correspondent Hansley also reported that the Soviet Union "has played a role in bringing the two sides closer together." It has "advised Hanoi that it expects the Johnson administration or any subsequent administration to stop bombing without North Vietnam making some concessions, which is unrealistic."

These reports from Western news agencies await further developments in the situation to be confirmed.

    西方通讯社纷纷报道越美“巴黎会谈”进入“微妙阶段”
    新华社十九日讯　越美“巴黎会谈”是在五月十三日正式开始的。目前，越美双方的正式会谈已经进行了二十六次。
    据美国和西方其他国家通讯社、报刊最近纷纷报道，美帝国主义头子约翰逊，目前正准备抛出一个“全面停炸”越南北方的大阴谋和骗局。
    合众国际社发自巴黎的消息说，巴黎会谈“已经进入一个微妙的阶段”，“有愈来愈多的迹象表明”，“巴黎会谈的僵持局面可能突破”，“这种突破可能以美国实行完全停炸的方式出现”。路透社从巴黎报道说，会谈“重点正在从主要的军事问题——河内要求美国停炸它的领土——转移到政治问题。”
    据美联社记者海托华从华盛顿发出的报道说，美国在“巴黎会谈”中推行了一个所谓“一揽子计划”。根据这个“一揽子计划”，“美国要求越南北方”在军事行动上要有“某种程度的克制”。合众国际社记者汉斯莱谈到美国在巴黎“暗地里”提出了一个“全面停炸”的“三点方案”。这个“三点方案”的内容包括要“越南方面”“从非军事区撤出他们的部队”，“停止对南越城市的一切恐怖活动和袭击”，“同意让西贡政府参加扩大的和谈。”
    据美联社十六日从西贡报道说，这一天美国驻南越“大使”邦克和南越傀儡头目阮文绍“匆忙举行了三次会议”。“一个政府人士告诉记者们注意着可能在华盛顿和西贡同时发表关于轰炸问题的声明”。法新社从西贡发出的消息说，“在邦克和阮文绍会谈后，关于美国准备下令完全停炸北越的消息，象野火一样扩散到整个西贡”。
    据法新社报道，约翰逊“采取这一行动，将会使很多犹豫不定的民主党选民投向汉弗莱阵营。”
    合众国际社记者汉斯莱还报道说，苏联“在设法使双方靠拢方面发挥了作用”。它已“向河内提出劝告，它期望约翰逊政府或者以后继任的任何政府在北越没有作出某些让步的情况下停止轰炸，这是不现实的。”
    西方通讯社这些消息，有待局势发展进一步证实。
