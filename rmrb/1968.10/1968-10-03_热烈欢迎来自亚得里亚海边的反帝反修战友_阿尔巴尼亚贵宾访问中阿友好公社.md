Warmly Welcoming Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Revisionist Comrades from the Adriatic Coast
Albanian Guests Visit the Sino-Albanian Friendship Commune

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 2nd, members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, including Rita Marko, Adil Charçani, Koco Theodhori, and Vasili Natanaeli, accompanied by Li Xiannian and others, visited the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune. They were warmly welcomed by the commune members.

When the Albanian comrades arrived at the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune, over 1,500 commune members, holding high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, lined up to welcome the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist comrades from the Adriatic coast.

The commune members, who have achieved double victories in revolution and production, held a grand welcoming ceremony in a place adorned with numerous red flags and large banners welcoming the Albanian Party and Government Delegation.

Charçani spoke at the ceremony. He said that the great victories achieved in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only make the Chinese people happy but also inspire the Albanian people. Because the Chinese Cultural Revolution is not only of great significance to China but also to the world.

He introduced to the commune members the great achievements made by the Albanian people in their revolutionary movement. He said that under the leadership of the Party of Labor of Albania and Comrade Hoxha, the Albanian people are carrying out a great political and ideological revolution, further revolutionizing national life, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidating national defense, and ensuring that our socialist motherland stands firmly and unshakably on the Adriatic coast.

Charçani warmly praised the friendship between Albania and China. He said that the friendship between the two countries, the two parties, and the two peoples is eternal. No matter what the circumstances, our two peoples will always stand together, fight together, and win together.
