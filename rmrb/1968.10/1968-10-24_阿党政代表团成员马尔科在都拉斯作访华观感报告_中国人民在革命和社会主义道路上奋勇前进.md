In his report, Comrade Marko also spoke about the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the tremendous achievements in production and construction, about the firm unity between the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, and about the common struggle being waged by the two parties and peoples of Albania and China against imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionists.
