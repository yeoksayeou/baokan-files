The waves of the French workers' political and economic general strike in May and June this year have heavily struck the capitalist economy of France, causing serious losses to France's industrial production, increasing fiscal deficits, massive outflow of gold and foreign exchange reserves, depreciation of the franc, rising unemployment, and soaring prices.

	Serious Losses in Industrial Production

	In recent years, as the shadow of the economic crisis in the capitalist world has drawn closer, the economic situation in France has continued to deteriorate. In 1967, France's industrial production had already stagnated, making it the worst year since the partial economic crisis in Western European countries in 1959. At the beginning of this year, the operating rate of French industry was only 80%.

	In the first half of this year, more than ten million French workers launched an unprecedented general strike, dealing a heavy blow to France's industrial production. According to a mid-August report from the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Research, this general strike caused France's industrial production to decline by 32.5%, with metallurgy, petroleum, gas, electricity, and construction industries being particularly severely affected. Western media estimated that the general strike caused French monopolies to lose at least 30 billion francs. Despite the French ruling class's recent frantic efforts to stimulate production, industrial production has somewhat recovered but is still far from making up for the aforementioned losses. For example, France's main emerging industry sector—the automobile industry—saw an increase in production in July, but the output for May, June, and July was still 23.4% lower than the same period in 1967, which had already shown signs of decline.

	Massive Outflow of Gold and Foreign Exchange

	The economic blow dealt by the French people's revolutionary struggle in May and June to French monopoly capital is another heavy one: France's long-accumulated gold and foreign exchange reserves quickly flowed out, causing the franc's position to plummet. Despite the French government's announcement of exchange controls at the end of May, prohibiting the outflow of currency, checks, and gold, and the subsequent raising of the discount rate of the Bank of France from 3.5% to 5% in early July to attract capital and curb the outflow of gold and foreign exchange reserves, France's gold and foreign exchange reserves have continued to flow out over the past half year. From early May to the end of September this year, France has lost over $2.6 billion in gold and foreign exchange, accounting for more than 40% of France's total reserves.

	Rising Unemployment

	Due to the stagnation of French industrial production and the mergers and layoffs by French monopolies to strengthen exploitation, unemployment in France has become increasingly severe in recent years. According to the significantly reduced figures released by the French government, the number of unemployed at the end of 1967 had already reached the highest level since the end of World War II. Since July this year, the number of unemployed in France has further increased, with the official figure reaching 284,000 by the end of July. However, French media revealed that the actual number of unemployed in July had already exceeded 540,000.

	Huge Deficits and Inflation

	To stimulate production, the French government has increasingly relied on measures such as increasing government investment and easing credit. This has resulted in huge fiscal deficits and the formation of an inflationary and price-increasing crisis.

	In 1967, France's fiscal deficit had already reached 7 billion francs, and it is expected to increase to 10.5 billion francs in 1968. The recent 1969 budget proposed by the French government indicates that France's fiscal deficit will further increase to over 11.5 billion francs. The huge fiscal deficit has led to inflation. In the first three quarters of 1967, the amount of paper currency in circulation and bank loans issued in France had already increased by 40% compared to the same period in 1966. As the fiscal deficit caused by government spending continues to increase, inflation will inevitably become more severe.

	Increasing Taxes and Rising Prices

	To reduce the deficit and alleviate financial difficulties, the French ruling class has repeatedly increased taxes, further exploiting the French working people. In January this year, the French government began levying the so-called "value-added tax," which included agriculture, service industries, and retail sectors, adding a heavy tax burden to the French working people. On July 3, the French government announced the levying of a new tax of 2.5 billion francs. Recently, the French government's new 1969 budget also stipulates an increase of 2.3 billion francs in taxes. The tax increases are diverse and extensive, covering beer, mineral water, gasoline, train tickets, and even birth and death.

	While taxes are increasing, prices are also rising. According to the obviously reduced official figures, prices in France had already risen by 3.5% last year, the most severe increase since 1964. At the beginning of this year, prices rose across the board, with some rising by 10%. After May, prices surged again, with the prices of people's necessities rising even more.

	During the period of May and June this year, to quell the anger of the French people's struggle, the French ruling class had hypocritically agreed to slightly increase workers' wages, but now they have taken it back through increased taxes and price hikes.

	The French bourgeoisie's intensified exploitation of the working people and the transfer of financial and economic difficulties are not only unable to save the French capitalist economy, which is riddled with holes, but will instead deepen France's political and economic crisis, further intensify France's class contradictions, and accelerate the political awakening of the French working people.

    法国工人大罢工的怒涛  沉重打击资本主义经济
    据新华社讯　今年五、六月，法国工人政治经济大罢工的怒潮，沉重地打击了法国的资本主义经济，使法国的工业生产损失严重，财政赤字越来越大，黄金外汇储备大量流失，法郎地位一落千丈，失业人数猛增，物价不断上涨。
      工业生产损失严重
    近几年来，随着资本主义世界经济危机的阴影日益逼近，法国的经济状况也不断恶化。一九六七年，法国的工业生产已陷于停滞状态，是一九五九年西欧国家普遍发生局部性经济危机以来最糟的。今年年初，法国工业的开工率只达到百分之八十。
    今年上半年，一千多万法国工人举行规模空前的总罢工，使法国工业生产受到沉重的打击。据法国国家统计和经济研究所八月中透露，这次总罢工使法国工业生产下降了百分之三十二点五，冶金、石油、煤气、电力、建筑业受到特别严重的打击。西方报刊估计，总罢工使法国垄断资本起码损失三百亿法郎。不管法国统治集团最近拚命刺激生产，工业生产有所恢复，但仍旧远远未能弥补上述损失。例如，法国主要新兴工业部门——汽车工业，七月份生产虽然有所增加，但五、六、七三个月的产量仍然比已经出现衰退的一九六七年同期减少了百分之二十三点四。
    黄金外汇大量流失
    法国人民五、六月间的革命斗争，在经济上对法国垄断资本的另一个沉重打击是：法国长期积累起来的黄金外汇储备迅速流失，因而使法国法郎的地位一落千丈。尽管法国政府五月底就宣布实行外汇管制，禁止货币、支票和黄金外流，七月初又把法兰西银行的贴现率从百分之三点五猛提到百分之五，借以吸引游资，抑止黄金外汇储备的流失；但是，半年来法国的黄金外汇储备仍然不断流失。从今年五月初到九月底，法国已经损失了黄金外汇二十六亿多美元，相当于法国全部储备的百分之四十以上。
    失业人数扶摇直上
    由于法国工业生产停滞，以及法国垄断资本为了加强剥削而合并企业、裁减人员等等，近年来法国失业现象越来越严重。据法国官方公布的大大缩小了的数字，一九六七年底失业人数已经创造了法国第二次世界大战后的最高纪录。今年七月以来，法国失业人数进一步增加，官方承认七月底已达到二十八万四千人。但是，法国报刊透露，七月份法国失业的人数实际上已达五十四万多人。
      赤字庞大通货膨胀
    为了刺激生产，法国政府越来越把赌注押在增加政府投资、放宽信贷等措施上面。这样就造成巨额的财政赤字，并形成通货膨胀、物价高涨的危局。
    一九六七年，法国的财政赤字已达七十亿法郎，一九六八年将增加到一百零五亿法郎，而最近法国政府提出的一九六九年的预算表明，一九六九年法国的财政赤字将进一步增加到一百一十五亿多法郎。庞大的财政赤字造成了通货膨胀。一九六七年头三个季度，法国流通的纸币和银行发放的贷款，已比一九六六年同期增加了百分之四十。随着政府支出的财政赤字的日益增加，通货膨胀势必越来越严重。
    捐税日增物价高涨
    为了减小赤字，摆脱财政困难，法国统治集团一再增加捐税，加紧向法国劳动人民开刀。今年一月，法国政府开始征收所谓“增值税”，征税的范围包括农业、服务性行业和零售业，使法国劳动人民增加了沉重的捐税负担。今年七月三日，法国政府又宣布征收二十五亿法郎的新税。最近，法国政府宣布的一九六九年的新预算中又规定将增税二十三亿法郎。增税的项目五花八门，包罗万象，啤酒、矿泉水、汽油、火车车票，以至出生、死亡都要加税。
    在捐税增加的同时，物价也越来越高。根据官方显然缩小了的数字，去年一年法国的物价已经上涨了百分之三点五，是一九六四年以来上涨最猛烈的。今年年初，物价又普遍上涨，有些上涨达百分之十。五月以后，物价再度猛涨，人民的生活必需品涨价更多。
    今年五、六月期间，法国统治集团为了平息法国人民斗争的怒火，曾经假惺惺地答应给工人增加了一点工资，现在又通过增加捐税和抬高物价搜刮了回去。
    法国垄断资产阶级加紧压榨劳动人民、转嫁财政经济困难的倒行逆施，不仅挽救不了百孔千疮的法国资本主义经济，相反只会加深法国的政治经济危机，使法国的阶级矛盾进一步激化，加速法国劳动人民在政治上的进一步觉醒。
