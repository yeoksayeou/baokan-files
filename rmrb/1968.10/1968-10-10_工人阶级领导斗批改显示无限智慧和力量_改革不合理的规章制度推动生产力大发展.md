Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant Resolutely Implements Chairman Mao's Directive That "The Working Class Must Lead Everything"

The working class of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, guided by Chairman Mao's latest directives, has fully played a leading role in the Cultural Revolution and all other work. In leading the entire plant in the struggle, criticism, and reform, they have demonstrated immense power. They have launched a fierce attack on the superstructure and old ideology that do not conform to the socialist economic base, greatly liberating the productive forces. A surging production high tide has quickly risen across the entire plant. Since the third quarter of this year, production levels have continued to rise, and all major product historical records have been comprehensively refreshed. The daily production growth rate of major products is generally between 30% and 50%, and the daily output of converter steel, electric furnace steel, and cast steel parts has increased by 80%, 95%, and 247% respectively compared to usual times.

Reforming regulations has greatly liberated the productive forces

This factory was previously controlled by China's Khrushchev's agent in Shanghai, Chen Pi-xian, and Cao Qi-qiu, and many revisionist "regulations" and "rules" were implemented here, causing widespread and deep harm, obstructing the development of productive forces. The smelting of stainless steel in electric furnaces is a routine operation, but the capitalist roaders only believed in "experts" and "authorities," not in the masses of workers, and established the "five no-smelting" system: no smelting at night, no smelting on Sundays, no smelting in new furnaces, no smelting in old furnaces, and no smelting without technical personnel present. After the revolutionary masses took power, the revolutionary criticism and denunciation fire burned this "five no-smelting" system to ashes. Now, smelting can be done every day and every shift. In the past, following the "five no-smelting" system, an electric furnace could only smelt five or six batches of stainless steel in one furnace life cycle, and often produced defective products; now, an electric furnace can smelt fifty or sixty batches of stainless steel in one furnace life cycle, and each batch is of high quality.

The old Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant under the control of a handful of capitalist roaders in the party also set up a large bureaucratic system. The old party committee and factory department established thirty departments and offices, and within each office, there were sections, and within each section, there were groups, and within each group, there were subgroups. A production figure had to be repeatedly counted by six offices, and if a production workshop needed to change a number, it had to deal with six offices. Even more despicable was the so-called technical inspection system, which set up many technical supervisors to supervise workers' operations, and the operational procedures were often formulated by bourgeois reactionary "authorities." If workers improved the operational procedures, even if they produced completely qualified products, they were still considered to have violated operational procedures and were labeled as defective products. There were countless such examples. The factory revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings to "streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, and transfer office personnel," mobilized and relied on the masses of workers to carry out a thorough reform of the factory management system, transferring 85% of the office personnel. At the same time, some outstanding workers were selected from the production frontline to enter the offices. Currently, 65% of the leaders of the factory department and various workshop revolutionary committees are worker representatives. In the past, factory department production meetings were attended only by workshop directors and section chiefs, and workers had no say. Now, the production command department holds meetings that must include worker representatives to listen to the opinions of the masses of workers, fully playing the leading role of the working class.

Breaking through old habits, fully unleashing human initiative

Under the rule of the revisionist line, the old Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant had long created a so-called "production law" that was considered difficult to change: the first quarter was slack, the second quarter was steady, the third quarter was stable, and the fourth quarter was a sprint. At a discussion meeting of the revolutionary committee of the second converter workshop, worker representatives proposed to break through the old framework of stable production of 1,300 tons per day in the high-temperature season, and some even proposed to break the high record of 1,835 tons created during the "January Revolution." But those influenced by old habits thought it was not feasible, reasoning that there was no precedent.

Is high production really so difficult? No. The worker representatives of the factory revolutionary committee best understood the feelings of the masses of workers. They deeply felt that through this great Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary and creative spirit hidden within the workers was being promoted. Workers could say it and could completely do it. The facts were indeed like this: almost every workshop in the entire factory made solemn vows before Chairman Mao's portrait: "No matter how high the temperature, our enthusiasm is higher; no matter how red the furnace, our loyalty to Chairman Mao is redder." "Grasp the revolution and promote production; fight the high temperature and seize high production; break the frameworks and blaze new trails, and present our loyalty to Chairman Mao with practical actions." With the support of military representatives, worker representatives suggested that the factory revolutionary committee and workshop revolutionary committees organize special study sessions and carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. Everyone studied Comrade Lin Biao's remarks that the human factor and political factor are the primary factors among the factors of combat effectiveness, recognizing that the primary factor among the factors of productive forces is people, people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Machines, equipment, environment, temperature, etc., are material factors and are in the second and third positions. One of the important signs of the revisionist line is "seeing things but not people," thus being "rightist conservative" and "fearful," not seeing the wisdom and strength of the masses.

After breaking free from the shackles of old ideas, everyone was full of confidence in supporting the masses of workers' revolutionary proposal of "high temperature, high production." From the standing committee of the factory revolutionary committee to the workers of each class, everyone was full of confidence and determined to create high production records in the high-temperature season.

A battle to fight the high temperature and seize high production was launched across the entire factory.

The leaders of the factory revolutionary committee appeared in the workers' ranks with a new attitude. Especially the worker representatives, they, like when they were workers, wore safety helmets and work clothes, and fought side by side with the masses on the production frontline. Military representatives and revolutionary cadres in the revolutionary committee were also where there were difficulties, they went to command the battle, and where there were problems, they went to study and solve them with worker comrades.

"Representing the advanced class's correct ideology, once grasped by the masses, will become the material force to transform society and the world." Without adding a single piece of equipment, the same people, production leaped forward. The daily output of the second converter workshop in late July increased by 38%, and then rose step by step, soaring to a new level of 80% increase compared to usual times. The daily output growth rate of cast steel parts was even greater, increasing from 149% to 247%. The entire factory quickly formed a thriving situation where everything was surging forward. All workshops refreshed their own daily output historical records.

What is truly amazing is the workers

The working class of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant used ironclad facts to refute the reactionary scoundrels who called themselves "electric furnace experts," "open hearth grandmasters," and "construction authorities," smashing the revisionist "crawling philosophy," overthrowing the bourgeois dictatorship of these "pseudo-foreigners" in the fields of science and technology production, and inspiring the revolutionary and creative spirit of the broad masses of workers.

The overhaul of the open hearth furnace workshop of this factory was a key project under the direct care and leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee. To strive for the early completion of the overhaul of the open hearth furnace and the early resumption of production, the relocation of two large chimneys was one of the key measures. These two chimneys, each 55 meters high and weighing 230 tons, needed to be moved 30 meters and 41 meters respectively. According to the previous methods, either the chimneys had to be dismantled and rebuilt, or the chimneys had to be laid down and erected on the new foundation. These two methods, although more assured, not only required more than fifty days of time but also consumed a large amount of manpower and material resources.

At that time, some engineers and technicians flipped through many books and materials but could not find a better solution. The foremen of the mechanical and electrical workshop's hoisting section heard this news and, based on their own work practice, conducted repeated comparisons and studies, boldly proposing the new plan of "vertical relocation," that is, to make the chimneys move upright to the new foundation without any damage. When this plan was proposed, some engineering and technical personnel shook their heads and believed there was no theoretical basis; others were skeptical. The worker comrades, following Chairman Mao's teachings to "dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and arouse the fearless spirit of creation, and not be intimidated by famous people and authorities," firmly said: "What is not in the books, we, the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, must create it!" The factory revolutionary committee and the leftist cadres of the People's Liberation Army strongly supported the workers' revolutionary innovation. They and the worker comrades carefully checked all the preparatory work and studied Chairman Mao's quotations with the foremen participating in the battle, conducting "pre-battle mobilization." The two chimneys were successfully completed in eight hours and five hours respectively, creating a rare miracle in the history of hoisting, creating important conditions for the early completion of the overhaul of the open hearth furnace. At the victory celebration meeting, the masses of workers dragged the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" of the factory to the scene for criticism. The worker foremen used one ironclad fact after another to refute these "open hearth grandmasters" who cursed workers' technological innovations as "reckless nonsense," leaving them speechless. The foremen excitedly said at the meeting: "Relying on Mao Zedong Thought, relying on the wisdom and strength of the workers, we can create any miracle in the world! Without you 'pseudo-foreigners,' we can still smelt steel and move chimneys, let your 'slave philosophy' and 'crawling philosophy' all go to hell!" A deputy chief engineer of the factory who had drunk a lot of "foreign ink" sincerely told the workers on the spot: "If I were to flip through books and materials, I would flip for three years and still wouldn't find it! What is truly amazing is the workers!"

Re-educating technical personnel, fully unleashing their role in production

The working class of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, placing the broad masses of technical personnel on the frontline of class struggle and production struggle, under the direct leadership of the working class, and through the practice of class struggle and production struggle, re-educating them. While re-educating technical personnel, they guided them to actively play a role in production.

There was a technical worker who was sent down to a class and group to learn electrical work with an apprentice, and he felt very uncomfortable: a university graduate doing an apprentice's work, how embarrassing! However, the worker comrades had a completely different view, believing this to be a very welcome phenomenon, the first step in the combination of intellectuals and workers. Therefore, contrary to this technical worker's expectations, the workers did not ignore him, did not mock him, but sincerely educated him and enthusiastically taught him operational skills. Once in contact with reality, he found that he was so ignorant, and even the apprentice he had always looked down upon was much more skilled in production practice. At this time, he deeply felt: what is truly embarrassing is not the "apprentice's apprentice," but the empty shell of intellectuals! His thoughts began to change, and his attitude also began to change. He humbly learned and worked hard with the workers to carry out a great technological revolution, achieving good results.

The working class of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant united the majority of technical personnel around themselves. Many technical personnel settled down in classes and groups, closely combining with workers, and made outstanding achievements in completing several important technological reforms. The success of the "vertical relocation" of the two large chimneys was the product of the close combination of technical personnel and workers. When some people expressed doubts about the "vertical relocation" plan and shouted "who is responsible if something goes wrong," a technical worker stepped forward and firmly said: "I am responsible! The practical experience of workers is the most reliable theoretical basis!" This technical worker actively cooperated with workers to conduct model experiments, combining revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude, making the implementation of the plan stand on a completely reliable basis. He also served as the deputy commander of this project, fighting side by side with workers on the frontline of construction, and was warmly praised by the masses of workers. Revolutionary technical personnel also worked with workers to conduct research and experiments, continuously smelting three batches of ultra-low carbon stainless steel with international advanced level. They also reformed the operational procedures, changing the three stages of electric furnace smelting into two stages, shortening the smelting time of each batch of steel by two hours, and increasing steel production by nearly one fold.

    上钢三厂坚决落实毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大指示
    工人阶级领导斗批改显示无限智慧和力量  改革不合理的规章制度推动生产力大发展
    今年第三季度以来，生产水平不断上升，全面刷新所有主要产品的历史最高纪录
    本报讯　上海第三钢铁厂的工人阶级，在毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，在文化大革命中和一切工作中充分发挥了领导作用，在领导全厂斗批改中显示了无比强大的威力。他们对不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑和旧的意识形态，发起了猛烈的冲击，大大解放了生产力。一个汹涌澎湃的生产高潮迅速在全厂兴起。今年第三季度以来，生产水平不断上升，所有主要产品的历史最高纪录全面刷新。主要产品的日产增长率一般都在百分之三十到百分之五十，特别是转炉钢、电炉钢和铸钢件的日产量，分别比平时增长百分之八十、百分之九十五和百分之二百四十七。
    规章制度的改革大大解放了生产力
    这个工厂过去是中国赫鲁晓夫在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋控制的重点单位，许多修正主义的“规章”“条例”在这里试行，流毒很广很深，阻碍着生产力的发展。电炉冶炼不锈钢，是一项普通操作技术，可是走资派只相信“专家”、“权威”，不相信工人群众，规定了“五不炼”的制度：夜班不炼，星期天不炼，新炉子不炼，老炉子不炼，技术人员不在场不炼。无产阶级革命派掌权后，革命大批判的烈火把这个“五不炼”烧成了灰烬，现在天天可以炼，班班可以炼。过去按“五不炼”制度办，一个电炉炉龄周期只能炼五、六炉不锈钢，还常出废品；现在一个电炉炉龄周期可以炼五、六十炉不锈钢，炉炉优质。
    党内一小撮走资派控制下的旧上钢三厂，还设置了一套庞大的官僚主义机构，旧党委和厂部共设立了三十个部门和科室，而且是科里有室，室里有组，组里还有组。一个生产数字，要有六个科室重复统计，生产车间要更改一个数字，非要到六个科室打交道不可。更可恨的是所谓技术检查制度，设了很多技术监督员，专门监督工人的操作，而工艺操作规程又往往是资产阶级反动“权威”制定的，如果工人改进了工艺操作，即使生产了完全合格的产品，也作为违反操作规程而打成废品。凡此种种，不一而足。厂革命委员会遵循毛主席“精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员”的教导，发动和依靠工人群众，对工厂管理体制进行了大刀阔斧的改革，科室人员下放百分之八十五。同时，从生产第一线抽调一些优秀工人进入科室。目前，厂部和各车间革委会的领导成员中，工人代表占百分之六十五。过去厂部开生产会，都是车间主任、科长参加，从来没有工人的份。现在生产指挥部开会，规定必须有工人代表参加，倾听工人群众的意见，充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用。
    冲破旧习惯势力，充分发挥人的积极因素
    修正主义路线统治下的旧上钢三厂，长期以来造成一种被认为难以改变的所谓“生产规律”，这就是：一季度松劲，二季度笃定，三季度保稳，四季度拚命。在第二转炉车间革委会的一次讨论会上，工人代表提出要冲破以往高温季度日产一千三百吨稳产的老框框，有的还提出要打破“一月革命”时创造的一千八百三十五吨的高纪录。但受旧习惯影响较深的人却认为不大行，理由是：没有先例。
    高产就真是这么难吗？不。厂革委会的工人代表最理解工人群众的心情，他们深深感到，通过这场伟大的文化大革命运动，蕴藏在工人中的革命创造精神正在发扬，工人们说得到，也完全能做得到。事实也正是这样：全厂差不多每个车间，都在毛主席像前发出豪迈誓言：“高温再高，没有我们工人的干劲高；炉火再红，没有我们工人无限忠于毛主席的忠心红。”“抓革命，促生产；战高温，夺高产；破框框，闯新路，以实际行动向毛主席敬献忠心”。工人代表在军代表的支持下，建议厂革委会和车间革委会组织专门学习，开展革命大批判。大家学习了林副主席关于人的因素、政治的因素，是战斗力诸因素中的首要因素的论述，认识到生产力诸因素中的首要因素是人，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。机器、设备、环境、气温等条件则是物的因素，是属于第二位、第三位的。而修正主义路线的一个重要标志，就是“见物不见人”，因而“右倾保守”，“怕”字当头，看不到群众的才智和力量。
    破除了旧思想的束缚，大家信心百倍地支持工人群众提出的“高温夺高产”的革命创议。从厂革委会的每个常委到各班组的工人，都满怀信心，决心在高温季度创造高产纪录。
    一场战高温，夺高产的斗争在全厂轰轰烈烈地展开了。
    厂革委会的领导以崭新的姿态出现在工人队伍中。尤其是工人代表，他们和当工人时一样，头戴安全帽，身穿工作服，和广大群众并肩战斗在生产第一线。革委会里军队代表和革命干部也都是那里有困难，就到那里去指挥战斗，那里有问题，就到那里去和工人同志一起研究解决。
    “代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”设备没有增加一件，人还是那些人，生产飞跃上升。第二转炉车间七月下旬日产量提高了百分之三十八，继而节节跃升，猛升到比平时增长百分之八十的崭新水平。铸钢件日产的增长幅度更大，从增长百分之一百四十九，猛增到百分之二百四十七。全厂迅速形成了万马奔腾的大好局面。所有车间都刷新了自己的日产历史最高纪录。
    真正了不起的是工人
    上钢三厂的工人阶级用铁一般的事实，把一些所谓“电炉专家”“平炉祖师爷”“基建权威”等反动家伙们批驳得丑态百出，砸烂了修正主义的“爬行哲学”，推翻了那些“假洋鬼子”在科技生产领域内对工人阶级实行的资产阶级专政，振奋了广大工人群众的革命创造精神。
    这个厂的平炉车间的大修，是在上海市革命委员会直接关怀和领导下的一个重点工程。要争取提前修好平炉，早日恢复生产，两个大烟囱移位是关键措施之一。这两个高达五十五米，重二百三十吨的大烟囱，要分别移动位置三十米和四十一米。按照以往的做法，要么将烟囱拆掉重建，要么把烟囱放倒，拉到新基础上重新树起来。这两种方法虽然把握较大，但不仅要用五十多天时间，而且要花费大量人力、物力。
    当时，一些工程师、技术员翻了许多时间的书本、资料，找不出更好的办法。厂里机电车间起重工段的老师傅听到这个消息后，结合自己的工作实践，经过反复比较、研究，大胆地提出“垂直移位”的新方案，也就是要叫烟囱丝毫不损地笔直“走”到新基础上去。这个方案一提出，有的工程技术人员不停地摇头，认为没有理论根据；有的将信将疑。工人同志按照毛主席“要敢想、敢说、敢干，振奋大无畏的创造精神，不要被名人、权威吓倒”的教导，坚定不移地说：“书本上没有的，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级一定要把它创造出来！”厂革委会和解放军支左人员大力支持工人的革命创举，他们和工人同志一起仔细检查各项准备工作，和参加战斗的老师傅一起学习毛主席语录，进行“战前动员”。两只烟囱分别以八小时和五小时的时间胜利完成了垂直移位工程，创造了起重史上罕见的奇迹，为提前修好平炉创造了重要条件。在庆祝胜利的大会上，工人群众把厂里的资产阶级反动技术“权威”揪到现场进行批判。工人老师傅用一桩桩铁的事实，把这些咒骂工人技术革新是“瞎胡闹”的“平炉祖师爷”驳得哑口无言。老师傅们在会上激动地说：“靠着毛泽东思想，靠着工人的智慧和力量，什么人间奇迹也能创造！没有你们这些‘假洋鬼子’，我们照样炼钢，照样搬烟囱，让你们的‘洋奴哲学’，‘爬行哲学’一齐见鬼去吧！”厂里一个喝过许多“洋墨水”的副总工程师，在现场大有感慨地对工人说：“叫我去翻书找资料，翻三年也翻不出来啊！真正了不起的是工人！”
    对技术人员实行再教育，充分发挥他们在生产中的作用
    上钢三厂工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把广大技术人员置于阶级斗争和生产斗争的第一线，置于工人阶级的直接领导下，通过阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践，对他们实行再教育。在对技术人员实行再教育的同时，引导他们在生产中积极发挥作用。
    有一个技术员，下放在班、组里，跟一个艺徒学配电，他非常想不通，感到难为情：大学生做艺徒的艺徒，这多么难看呀！但是，工人同志却有着完全不同的看法，认为这是十分可喜的现象，是知识分子与工人相结合的第一步。因而，出乎这位技术员的意料，工人们不是冷淡他，不是嘲笑他，而是非常诚恳地教育他，非常热情地教他学习操作技能。一旦接触实际，他就发现，自己是多么无知，连他一向瞧不起的艺徒，在生产实践中也比他高明得多。这时，他深切地感到：真正难看的不是“艺徒的艺徒”，而是知识分子的空架子！思想开始变了，态度也开始变了，他虚心学习，踏踏实实地和工人一起大闹技术革命，取得了良好的成绩。
    上钢三厂的工人阶级把大多数技术人员团结在自己的周围。不少技术人员到班、组安家落户，同工人紧密结合，对完成几项重要的技术改革作出了显著的成效。两个大烟囱“垂直移位”的成功，就是技术人员和工人紧密结合的产物。当有些人对“垂直移位”的方案表示怀疑，声称“没有理论根据”，并且大叫“出了问题谁负责”时，一位技术员挺身而出，坚定地说：“我负责！工人的实践经验就是最可靠的理论根据！”这位技术员积极协同工人进行模型试验，把革命精神和科学态度结合起来，使方案的实施立于完全可靠的基础上。他还担任了这一工程的副总指挥，同工人并肩战斗在施工第一线，受到工人群众的热情赞扬。革命的技术人员还和工人一起，经过研究试验，连续炼出了三炉具有国际先进水平的超低碳不锈钢。他们还改革了工艺操作，把电炉冶炼的三个阶段，革新为二个阶段，使每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短了两个小时，钢产量增长将近一倍。
