The cadres and students of the May Seventh Cadres School in Liuhe, Heilongjiang Province, have been studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions diligently over the past few days: "A large number of cadres should be sent down for labor. This is an excellent opportunity for cadres to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also be sent down for labor in batches." They have decided to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, further improve the school, and undergo a thorough ideological transformation through labor. Below is a summary of the discussions held by some cadres and students of the school on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are our highest guiding principles for running the school

Xiao Jinglong (Revolutionary Committee Chairman of the School, former staff member of the Provincial Committee's Department of Finance and Commerce): When the People's Daily published a news report about our school and added an editorial note conveying the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, it was the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest inspiration for the more than 500 students of our May Seventh Cadres School. We have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions carefully, and now we have a clear direction for further improving the May Seventh Cadres School.

Our May Seventh Cadres School was established according to Chairman Mao's May Seventh Directive, in the midst of thoroughly criticizing the revisionist line that China's Khrushchev had promoted in the construction of political power and cadre education, and in the forefront of the three great revolutionary struggles. Over the past five months, we have taken solid steps on the road to the ideological transformation of cadres. In this school, regardless of whether one was originally a minister, a section chief, or a general cadre, everyone is an ordinary laborer, studying, working, and living together. Everyone takes the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the transformation of one's worldview as the most important task. Some of us forge iron, some grind flour, some drive carts, some operate tractors, some plant vegetables, and some burn bricks for basic construction. Through a period of labor training, the ideological transformation of cadres has been greatly promoted, and everyone's spiritual outlook has changed significantly. Comrades say: "Thousands of changes, tens of thousands of changes, the greatest change is from being an official to being a common person." Here, everyone appears in the guise of an ordinary laborer, serving as both the driving force and the object of the revolution; being both an official and a common person; being both a manager and a producer, completely changing the past phenomenon of long-term office work, high status, and being an official and a lord.

We have many experiences in running the school, but the most fundamental one is to follow Chairman Mao and achieve victory. Chairman Mao's brilliant May Seventh Directive is the fundamental program for running our school. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the highest guiding principles for running our school. Our school has decided to make October 4th an annual day of grand celebration. We will set Chairman Mao's latest instructions to music as our school song, engrave them in our hearts, and use them as a great motivating force to always unite with workers and peasants.

The May Seventh Cadres School has restored my revolutionary youth

Wen Rongxi (student of the May Seventh Cadres School, former deputy director of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions): After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the editorial note of the People's Daily, I am very excited. We will resolutely follow the direction indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao and continue on this path forever; only by following this path can we fundamentally prevent the emergence of revisionism, keep the broad cadres forever young in revolution, and carry the revolution through to the end. I am a poor child who herded sheep for the landlord since I was young. It was Chairman Mao who saved me from suffering. In the past few decades of life, I followed Chairman Mao to make revolution, and in the battles, I was never defeated by the armed enemy. However, after entering the city and staying in the office, sitting in a car, I gradually forgot Chairman Mao's teachings, lost the revolutionary traditions, and became alienated from labor and the masses, undergoing a peaceful evolution, and sliding towards a very dangerous path. Fortunately, it was Chairman Mao who personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that saved me. Later, the organization sent me to the May Seventh Cadres School for study. Although I am over fifty, in the school, I feel younger by several decades, with more revolutionary spirit than before, as if I have returned to the youthful days of just joining the revolution.

The revolutionary traditions that I had forgotten after entering the city are now revived here. When I picked up the shepherd's crook that I had put down for decades, I was deeply moved. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, our party cadres fought and lived with the broad masses, maintaining a fish-water relationship, and finally defeated the enemy and achieved victory. Now, picking up the shepherd's crook again is the beginning of restoring revolutionary traditions, urging myself to always maintain revolutionary traditions and never change.

Revolutionary rebels must also continually transform their worldview

Liu Junjie (Company Commander of the May Seventh Cadres School, former cadre of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League): At the beginning of this year, the organization arranged for me to work in the May Seventh Cadres School. At that time, I thought: My family background is good, and I am a revolutionary rebel during the Cultural Revolution. What do I need to reform? Therefore, I was initially unwilling to be sent down for labor.

After arriving at the May Seventh Cadres School, I received profound education from interacting with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. During the spring plowing and sowing, an old poor peasant patiently taught us how to sow and fertilize. However, because I was in the field but my mind was in the city, I worked hastily and unevenly, affecting the sowing quality. The old poor peasant noticed this and had a heart-to-heart talk with me, helping me improve my understanding of labor. That night, the old poor peasant checked himself for not helping me enough during the study and discussion of Chairman Mao's works. The old poor peasant's loyalty to Chairman Mao and selfless revolutionary spirit deeply moved me. I realized that my previous belief that my worldview had no problems and did not need reform was contrary to Chairman Mao's teachings that "intellectuals must also be reformed, not only those whose fundamental stance has not yet changed need to be reformed, but everyone should learn and be reformed." Since then, I not only settled down in the May Seventh Cadres School but also continually strengthened the transformation of my worldview through labor. This year, when we were weeding, I fell ill, and doctors and comrades advised me to go to Harbin for treatment. I thought: Now is the busy agricultural season, and it is also the best opportunity to learn from the workers and peasants and reform myself, so I insisted on not leaving the front line.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are not only the fundamental way for old cadres to remain young in revolution but also point the direction for the ideological transformation of young cadres like us. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, always stay with the masses, frequently participate in productive labor, and achieve new merits for the people on the road of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Sincerely accept the re-education of workers and peasants

Zhu Guangyin (Political Instructor of the Third Company of the May Seventh Cadres School, former young cadre of the Provincial Committee's Office): In the five months of labor training at the May Seventh Cadres School, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the absolute truth, hitting the mark for us. I am a "three-doors" cadre, having stayed in the office building for twelve years without ever deeply entering the workers and peasants. This time, coming to the May Seventh Cadres School, is a good opportunity for me to receive re-education from the workers and peasants.

This year in July, our school started a brewery from scratch. Nearby poor and lower-middle peasants heard about it and voluntarily came to help. An old master of brewing, despite being ill, taught us the techniques. A few days later, when the clear wine flowed out, the old poor peasant, due to continuous overwork, could not hold on and fainted. The poor and lower-middle peasants' selfless working attitude deeply educated me. In front of workers, peasants, and soldiers, I am always a small student. When the school needed to build a dam, I signed up for the shock team to temper my red heart loyal to Chairman Mao in the most difficult and arduous place. During the construction, I and my comrades took off our cotton clothes, shouting "Determine to overcome all difficulties, dare to sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," jumped into the waist-deep river, overcame the cold, and successfully completed the task. In the past, I treated participating in labor as a temporary job and was afraid of hard labor. Now, hard labor is a big classroom for tempering my red heart loyal to Chairman Mao forever. My five months at the May Seventh Cadres School are five months of struggle.

Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals and the re-education given to me by the workers and peasants have changed my previous incorrect thoughts of looking down on the workers and peasants. At the May Seventh Cadres School, I not only learned many kinds of labor but, more importantly, cultivated my deep class feelings for the workers and peasants.

Train myself to be a person who can be both an official and a common person

Gao Qian (student of the May Seventh Cadres School, former deputy secretary of the Provincial Committee's Propaganda Department): Chairman Mao's latest instructions have hit the mark for me. I have participated in the revolution for more than twenty years without doing a day of grassroots work and truly being an ordinary laborer. Long-term in a leadership position, the thought of seeking comfort has become stronger. Coming to the May Seventh Cadres School, I am a farm tool worker, an ordinary laborer. From being an official to serving the people, my thoughts and feelings have changed greatly.

In the past, I was poisoned by the revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, and my worldview was not thoroughly transformed. Although I went to the countryside and carried out the "Four Clean-ups" in the villages, implementing the "Three Together" with the poor and lower-middle peasants, I was still in the guise of an official, with the starting point of "educating others." Therefore, the "Three Together" was "same bed, different dreams," and my thoughts and feelings were still alienated from the masses. This time, coming to the May Seventh Cadres School, I am an ordinary laborer, wholeheartedly accepting the re-education of the workers and peasants, and the feeling is completely different. Because we labor and live with the workers and peasants, we have common thoughts and feelings and common language, thus obtaining the basic conditions for accepting the re-education of the workers and peasants.

From being an official to serving the people, my thoughts and feelings have undergone a great change. In the past, I could only be an official and could not serve the people; I could only command the masses and could not be supervised by them. Now, as an ordinary laborer, I honestly become a small student in front of my former subordinates and the workers and peasants, obey their commands, and follow the discipline without any special treatment. This promotes me to struggle against the filthy soul of "revolting to be an official" and struggle against the old ways of the bourgeoisie. In the continuous struggle, I gradually got rid of my official airs.

After solving the problem of being an official to serving the people, there is still the problem of what kind of common person to be. In the past, I made mistakes and was criticized during the Cultural Revolution, and my thoughts could not be aroused. In this revolutionary crucible of the May Seventh Cadres School, class struggle and ideological struggle are very intense, giving me great tempering. From the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, I realize that we communists are revolutionaries. We May Seventh fighters must train ourselves to be a new generation of communists who can be both officials and common people, both workers and peasants, both intellectuals and soldiers.

### 坚决遵照毛主席最新指示办好“五·七”干校  在下放劳动过程中锻炼成能“官”能民的人——柳河“五·七”干校部分干部和学员学习毛主席最新指示的座谈纪要

    坚决遵照毛主席最新指示办好“五·七”干校  在下放劳动过程中锻炼成能“官”能民的人
    ——柳河“五·七”干校部分干部和学员学习毛主席最新指示的座谈纪要
    本报讯　黑龙江省柳河“五·七”干校的广大干部和学员，连日来认真学习了毛主席的最新指示：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”他们决心按照毛主席所指引的方向，进一步把干校办得更好，在下放劳动的过程中重新学习，使自己的精神面貌来一个比较彻底的革命化。下面是这个学校部分干部和学员的座谈纪要。
    毛主席的最新指示是我们办校的最高指导方针
    萧景隆（校革委会主任、原省委财贸部干事）：《人民日报》在发表我们学校的新闻报道时所加的编者按中，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，这对我们“五·七”干校五百多名学员是最大的关怀，最大的鞭策，最大的鼓舞。我们认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，对进一步办好“五·七”干校，有了明确的方向。
    我们“五·七”干校，是按照毛主席的“五·七”指示，在彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设和干部教育方面所推行的修正主义路线的斗争中，在三大革命斗争的第一线上创办的。建校五个多月以来，我们在实现干部思想革命化的道路上，跨出了坚实的第一步。在这所学校里，不分原来是部长、处长，还是一般干部，都是普通劳动者，都在一起学习、劳动和生活，都把活学活用毛泽东思想，改造自己的世界观作为头等重要的任务。我们有的打铁，有的磨面，有的赶车，有的开拖拉机，有的种菜，有的烧砖搞基本建设。经过一段劳动锻炼，大大地促进了干部的思想革命化，大家的精神面貌变化很大，同志们说：“千变化，万变化，最大的变化是从‘官’变为民。”在这里，大家以普通劳动者的姿态出现，既当革命的动力，又做革命的对象；既当“官”，又做老百姓；既是管理者，又是生产者，彻底改变了过去长期蹲机关，高高在上，做官当老爷的现象。
    我们在办校的过程中有很多体会，最根本的一条是紧跟毛主席就是胜利。毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，是我们办校的根本纲领。毛主席的最新指示，是我们办校的最高指导方针。我们学校已作出决定：把十月四日这一天，作为每年隆重庆祝的日子。把毛主席的最新指示，谱成校歌，铭记在心里，作为鼓舞我们永远同工农相结合的巨大动力。
    “五·七”干校使我恢复了革命的青春
    温溶洗（“五·七”干校学员、原省工会副主任）：学习了毛主席的最新指示和《人民日报》的编者按语，心情非常激动。我们坚决遵循伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向走下去，永远走下去；只有走这条路，才能从根本上防止出修正主义，使广大干部永葆革命的青春，把革命进行到底。我是一个穷孩子，从小给地主放羊，是毛主席他老人家把我从苦水里救出来。在过去几十年的生活中，我跟着毛主席闹革命，在战斗中，没有被拿枪的敌人所征服过。但是，进城后蹲起了机关，坐上了小汽车，渐渐忘记了毛主席的教导，丢掉了革命的优良传统，脱离了劳动，脱离了群众，思想上开始和平演变，向极其危险的道路上滑下去。多亏毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，才挽救了我。后来，组织上把我送到“五·七”干校学习。我虽然是年过半百的人，但在干校里我感到年轻了几十岁，革命朝气比以前足了，好象又重新回到刚刚参加革命的青年时代。
    进城后被自己忘掉的革命传统，在这里又重新发扬起来。当我重新拿起放下了几十年的牧羊鞭子时，真是感慨万分。在抗日战争和解放战争的艰苦年代里，我们党的干部就是同广大群众同战斗、同生活，保持着鱼水的联系，才最后战胜了敌人，取得了胜利。现在，我重新拿起放羊鞭，就是恢复革命传统的开始，它鞭策自己永远保持革命传统，永不变色。当我赶着羊群，爬山涉水，早晚放牧时，我感到自己又走在毛主席的革命路线上，越走越觉得毛主席亲，越走和贫下中农的感情越深。
    革命造反派也要不断改造世界观
    刘俊杰（“五·七”干校一连长、原团省委干部）：今年年初，组织上安排我到“五·七”干校劳动，当时我心里想：我家庭出身好，在文化大革命中又是革命造反派，我有什么好改造的呢？因此对下放劳动一时想不通。
    到“五·七”干校后，在和工人、贫下中农相处的日子里，受到了深刻的教育。春耕播种时，老贫农耐心地教我们点种、施肥。可是由于我人在田间，心在城市，干活光图快，播种不均匀，影响播种质量。这位老贫农发现后，就同我谈心，帮助我提高对劳动的认识。那天晚上，这位老贫农在座谈学习毛主席著作体会时，还检查了对我帮助不够。这位老贫农忠于毛主席、一心为公的革命精神，深深地感动了我。使我认识到，过去认为自己的世界观没有问题，不需要改造的想法，正是同毛主席关于“知识分子也要改造，不仅那些基本立场还没有转过来的人要改造，而且所有的人都应该学习，都应该改造”的教导相违背的。从此以后，我不仅安心在“五·七”干校，而且在劳动中不断加强对自己世界观的改造。今年铲地时，我得了病，大夫和战友们劝我到哈尔滨去看看。我想：现在正是生产大忙季节，也是向工农群众学习、改造自己的最好机会，因此坚持不下火线。
    毛主席的最新指示，不仅是老干部永葆革命青春的根本途径，对于我们青年干部的思想革命化，也指明了方向。我一定按照毛主席的教导，永远同群众在一起，经常参加生产劳动，在同工农兵相结合的道路上，为人民立新功。
    真心实意地接受工农的再教育
    朱光银（“五·七”干校三连政治指导员、原省委办公厅青年干部）：我在“五·七”干校五个月的劳动锻炼中，深深体会到毛主席最新指示是千真万确的真理，句句说到了我们的心坎上。我是一个“三门”干部，过去在机关的大楼里蹲了十二年，从没有深入到工农群众中去过一次。这次来到“五·七”干校，是我接受工农群众再教育的好机会。
    今年七月，我们干校白手起家办了一个酒厂。附近的贫下中农听说后，主动前来帮忙。一个烧酒的老把式带病教我们技术。几天以后，当清清的酒浆流出来时，这位老贫农因连续劳累，身体支持不住，昏迷过去了。贫下中农这种忘我的劳动态度，深刻地教育了我。在工农兵面前，我永远是个小学生。当干校要修拦河大坝的时候，我为了在最困难、最艰苦的地方锻炼忠于毛主席的红心，报名参加了突击队。施工时，我和战友们脱掉身上的棉衣，高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，跳进没腰深的河中，战胜了寒冷，胜利完成了任务。过去在机关里把参加劳动当成临时差事，对艰苦的劳动望而生畏。现在，艰苦的劳动，就是锻炼自己永远忠于毛主席的红心的大课堂。我在“五·七”干校的五个月，是战斗的五个月。
    毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的一系列最新指示，工农群众给我的再教育，使我改变了过去长期轻视工农群众的不正确思想。在“五·七”干校，我不仅学会了许多种劳动活，更重要的是培养了自己对工农群众的深厚阶级感情。
    把自己锻炼成能上能下能“官”能民的人
    高骞（“五·七”干校学员、原省委宣传部副秘书长）：毛主席的最新指示，说到了我的心坎里。我参加革命二十多年，没有做过一天基层工作，没有真正当过一天普通劳动者。长期在领导岗位上，“官”越做越大，贪图安逸的思想也越来越浓。到了“五·七”干校，我是一名农具手，当了普通劳动者。从当“官”到为民，思想感情起了很大的变化。
    过去，我由于受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的毒害，加上世界观没有得到彻底的改造，虽然也下乡，也在农村搞过“四清”，同贫下中农实行过“三同”，但是，那时我是以“官”的姿态出现的，出发点是为了“教育别人”。因此，那时的“三同”是“同床异梦”，思想感情还是同群众格格不入的。而这次到“五·七”干校来，就是当一个普通劳动者，全心全意接受工农群众的再教育，感受就大不相同。由于我们同工农群众劳动和生活在一起，就有了共同的思想感情，共同的语言，取得了接受工农群众再教育的基本条件。
    从当“官”到为民，使我思想感情上起了一个很大的变化。过去，只能当“官”，不能为民；只能指挥群众，不能受群众监督。现在当了普通劳动者，在自己以前的下级干部和工农群众面前，老老实实当小学生，听从他们的指挥，服从纪律，毫不特殊。这就促使我同“为当官而革命”的肮脏灵魂作斗争，就要同资产阶级的一套旧作风作斗争。在不断的斗争中，逐渐地把官气斗掉了。
    解决了从当“官”到为民的问题之后，还有一个究竟要当什么“民”的问题。过去我犯了错误，在文化大革命中受了批判，思想一度振作不起来。在“五·七”干校这个革命大熔炉里，阶级斗争和思想斗争都十分紧张，使我受到很大锻炼。我从活学活用毛主席著作中，认识到我们共产党人是干革命的。我们“五·七”战士，一定要把自己锻炼成能上能下、能“官”能民、亦工亦农、亦文亦武的一代共产主义新人。
