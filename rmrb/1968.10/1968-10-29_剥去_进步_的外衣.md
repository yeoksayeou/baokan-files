The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to use the counter-revolutionary revisionist line to transform our party, frantically advocates the "join the party to become an official" theory. His so-called "seeking one's own progress" is just one of the black fruits on the black vine of his "join the party to become an official" theory.

What is the Chinese Khrushchev's "seeking one's own progress"? In his words, it is to make oneself into a "revolutionary" who can undertake "great tasks," to become a "leader and hero" who can gain the "faith and support of the party and the masses," and so on.

This old and cunning counter-revolutionary big ambitionist, the Chinese Khrushchev, thinks that by adding some fancy labels to his black goods, he can be more "clever" than those barefaced peddlers of bourgeois individualist philosophy. He waves the banner of "struggle," saying that one should "seek one's own progress in this struggle." At the same time, he reveals his "ambitious goals," arrogantly declaring, "The personal status cannot be higher than that of an emperor, but compared with the cause of communism, how much is it really?" It's all about "struggle" and "comparison with the cause of communism," truly dazzling and unpredictable.

However, "fake is fake, and the disguise should be stripped away." Despite the Chinese Khrushchev's twisted words, his ambition as a schemer is fully revealed between the lines. Stripping away the facade of his "seeking one's own progress," it turns out that "struggle," "communist cause," for the Chinese Khrushchev, are all just deceptive pretexts. His true purpose is to climb over the heads of the people to become a "leader and hero" who gains the "faith and support of the party and the masses," to steal a "personal status higher than an emperor." His wolfish ambitions are as clear as day.

The Chinese Khrushchev fervently peddles this reactionary fallacy of "seeking one's own progress," with extremely malicious intentions. He aims to use "progress"—name, position, high rank, and fat salary as bait—to corrupt our broad masses of party members, making them peacefully evolve into market-minded individuals and personal ambitionists like him, becoming the organizational foundation for him to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. This is especially evident in this stormy Cultural Revolution. When the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses rise up to rebel against him, he hurriedly issues black orders, telling officials and party members at all levels to "hold firm," to "accept the test of struggle." The implication is: if you can "hold firm" in the "struggle," you are a "good example," and promotions, official posts, and "progress" will be yours in the future. The Chinese Khrushchev's soul is rotten, his face is ugly, his methods are shameless, and his intentions are despicable, truly beyond words.

What kind of "progress" is this? This is pure reaction! Following this path of "progress" marked with the black footprints of the Chinese Khrushchev, it can only cause history to regress, the regime to change color, and the people's country to return to the depths of suffering under capitalism and semi-colonial, semi-feudal rule. This is absolutely unacceptable!

We proletarian revolutionary fighters and true communists have our own revolutionary view of progress.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We communists are not seeking office but are seeking revolution." We communists are servants of the people and are definitely not officials or lords. "Selflessly serving the people," "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, is the highest standard of our revolutionary view of progress. Having only Chairman Mao and the people in our hearts is the most sublime spiritual realm of our revolutionary view of progress.

    剥去“进步”的外衣
    上海绝缘测定器厂工人　钟晓阳
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了用反革命修正主义建党路线来改造我们的党，疯狂鼓吹“入党做官论”。他的所谓“求得自己的进步”，就是“入党做官论”这根黑藤上的黑瓜之一。
    什么是中国赫鲁晓夫的“求得自己的进步”呢？用他的话来说，就是为了使自己变成担当“大任”的“革命家”，成为“取得党与群众的信仰和拥护”的“领袖与英雄”，等等。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个老奸巨滑的反革命大野心家，自以为在他的黑货上加上些漂亮的招牌，就可以比那些赤裸裸地贩卖资产阶级利己主义哲学的蠢驴们“高明”一着，就可以一手遮尽天下人耳目。他一面打起了“斗争”的旗号，说什么“要在这种斗争中求得自己的进步”；一面又亮出了他的“雄心壮志”的底牌，狂妄宣称什么：“个人地位总莫高过于皇帝了，然而拿这来与共产主义事业家比较，到底又有多大呢？”又是“斗争中”，又是“与共产主义事业家比较”，真是令人眼花缭乱，变幻莫测。
    然而，“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”尽管中国赫鲁晓夫说得转弯抹角，但字里行间仍充分流露出阴谋家的勃勃野心。剥开他的“求得自己的进步”的画皮来看，原来“斗争”，“共产主义事业”，对于中国赫鲁晓夫来说，都不过是骗人的幌子。他的真正目的，是要爬到人民群众头上做“取得党与群众的信仰和拥护”的“领袖与英雄”，窃取“高过于皇帝”的“个人地位”。狼子野心，昭然若揭。
    中国赫鲁晓夫狂热地兜售这种“求得自己的进步”的反动谬论，用心是极其险恶的。他就是妄图以“进步”——名利地位、高官厚禄作钓饵，来腐蚀我们的广大党员，使之和平演变为象他那样的市侩和个人野心家，成为他颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的组织基础。这一点，在这场急风暴雨的文化大革命中表现得尤为明显。当亿万革命群众起来造他的反时，他就急急忙忙下黑指令，要各级干部和党员“顶住”，要“接受斗争的考验”。言外之意就是：在“斗争中”“顶住”了，就是“好样的”，来日“提拔”、“升官”、“进步”就少不了你。中国赫鲁晓夫灵魂之腐朽，嘴脸之丑恶，手法之无耻，用心之卑鄙，真是无以复加的了。
    这是什么“进步”？这是十足的反动！沿着这条印满了中国赫鲁晓夫黑足迹的邪路“进步”下去，只能使历史大倒退，政权大变色，使人民的江山重新倒退到资本主义，倒退到半殖民地半封建的苦难深渊里去。这是绝对不能容许的！
    我们无产阶级革命战士和真正的共产党员，有我们自己的革命的进步观。
    毛主席教导说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。我们共产党员是人民的勤务员，而决不是当官做老爷。“毫不利己专门利人”，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就是我们的革命进步观的最高标准。心中只有毛主席，心中只有人民群众，就是我们的革命进步观的最崇高的精神境界。
