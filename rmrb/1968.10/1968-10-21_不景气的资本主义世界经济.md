The capitalist world economy is in a slump. The U.S. steel industry has seen a significant drop in production. According to the mouthpiece of U.S. steel monopolies, *Steel Century*, the amount of steel shipped from various steel mills in August was only half of that in July. Due to a sharp decline in sales, steel companies have been shutting down furnaces and factories. To pass on their difficulties, capitalists began laying off workers in large numbers starting from mid-July. It is estimated that by mid-September, over 50,000 steel workers had been laid off in just two months; by the end of this year, the total number of laid-off workers could reach 100,000.

The British workers' strikes have dealt a heavy blow to the capitalist economy. The British Ministry of Labour recently admitted that in the first eight months of this year, British workers lost 3.5 million working days due to strikes. This figure is nearly double that of the same period last year. The automobile industry was the hardest hit, losing 678,000 working days due to strikes, compared to 285,000 working days in the same period last year.

Unemployment in France has reached 550,000. The French newspaper *Le Parisien* reported that unemployment has become the top "troublesome issue" in France. In August alone, 284,700 people sought employment. If those who did not register with the official labor bureau are included, the unemployment figure reaches 550,000.

The Dutch government has decided to increase taxes to cover the deficit. Due to following the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization's war policies and significantly increasing military spending, the Dutch government's budget for this year has a deficit of 25 million guilders. To balance the new budget, the Dutch government has decided to impose higher taxes on postal services and cigarettes to cover the deficit.

Japan is facing a wave of price hikes. The *Asahi Shimbun* reported that with the decision to raise rice prices in early October, Japan is experiencing a widespread "price hike storm." Now, public utility fees such as water, bath, and sewage disposal fees, as well as train and bus fares, are all increasing. Water fees have risen by 42.5% to 73%. Student train monthly passes have increased by 40.5% to 97%. A company in Hokkaido increased the price of coal from 150 yen to 300 yen in just one month. Even the Economic Planning Agency of Japan is worried that "if this trend continues, it may become a comprehensive price hike similar to that in 1965."

Imperialist countries are forcing Ivory Coast to destroy coffee. Due to the economic downturn in capitalist countries, there is an oversupply of coffee in the international market. Imperialist countries are very concerned that this will cause coffee prices to drop, leading to profit losses. Recently, through the so-called "International Coffee Agreement," they forced Ivory Coast to dump or burn 100,000 tons of coffee stored in over 20 warehouses. The hard work of the people of Ivory Coast has gone to waste.

Mexico uses over one-third of its exports to repay debts. The Mexican government's direct debt totaled $359.2 million by December 31 last year, accounting for about 14.1% of the national GDP. Just for 1968, the principal and interest on foreign long-term debts to be repaid amount to $570 million, accounting for 37.4% of the total export earnings. This means that over one-third of Mexico's exports this year are used to repay debts.

    不景气的资本主义世界经济
    美国的钢铁工业生产大幅度地下降
    据美国钢铁垄断资本的喉舌《钢铁世纪》不久前透露，八月份美国各钢厂出厂的钢材数量只及七月份的一半。由于销路锐减，各钢铁公司纷纷停炉关厂。资本家为了转嫁困难，早从七月中旬起就开始大批裁减工人。据估计，到九月中旬为止，短短两个月里就有五万余名钢铁工人遭到解雇；到今年年底前，解雇工人总数可能达到十万人。
    英工人罢工沉重打击资本主义经济
    英国劳工部最近发表的报告承认，今年头八个月由于英国工人罢工而损失了三百五十万个工作日。这个数字几乎比去年同期增加两倍。受到打击最严重的是英国汽车工业，因罢工而损失的工作日有六十七万八千个。而去年同期只有二十八万五千工作日。
    法国失业大军已高达五十五万之多
    法国《今日巴黎报》报道，失业问题已成为法国目前头号的“令人苦恼的问题”。仅八月份，要求就业的有二十八万四千七百人。如果加上没有在官方的劳动局登记的人，失业大军已高达五十五万人之多。
      荷兰政府决定增加税收来弥补赤字
    荷兰政府由于追随美帝控制的北大西洋侵略集团的战争政策，大量增加军费，结果使本年度预算出现了二千五百万荷兰盾（荷兰货币）的赤字。为了平衡新预算，荷兰政府决定向人民开刀，宣布增加邮费和纸烟的税收来弥补赤字。
    日本全国各地刮起“涨价的旋风”
    日本《朝日新闻》报道，随着十月初大米涨价的决定，日本全国掀起广泛的“涨价的旋风”。现在公共事业费，如水费、洗澡费、清除粪尿费以及铁路、公共汽车票价无一不涨价。水费从提高百分之四十二点五到百分之七十三。学生铁路月票票价上涨从百分之四十点五到百分之九十七。北海道一公司出售的煤，一个月内从一百五十日元涨到三百日元。连日本经济计划厅也担心“按照这种趋势发展下去，很有可能成为……一九六五年来的全面性涨价”。
    帝国主义逼迫象牙海岸销毁咖啡
    由于资本主义国家经济不景气，国际市场上咖啡过剩。帝国主义国家十分害怕这会使咖啡跌价，造成利润损失，不久前通过所谓“国际咖啡协定”，迫使象牙海岸把国内二十多个仓库的十万吨咖啡倒入海中或烧毁。象牙海岸人民辛苦劳动付之流水。
    墨西哥出口的三分之一多用来还债
    墨西哥政府在去年十二月三十一日的直接债务总数是三十五亿九千二百万美元，占国民生产总值的约百分之十四点一。仅仅一九六八年要偿付的国外长期债款，包括本息就要五亿七千万美元，占出口收入总数的百分之三十七点四，就是说，墨西哥今年出口的三分之一多是用来还债的。
