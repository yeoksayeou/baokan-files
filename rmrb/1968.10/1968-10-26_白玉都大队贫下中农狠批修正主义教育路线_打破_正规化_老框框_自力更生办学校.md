The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyudou Production Brigade in Guoqian People's Commune, Menggu Autonomous County, Liaoning Province, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, have smashed the so-called "centralized schooling" and "standardized schooling" revisionist educational line. In the remote mountainous villages where commune members are scattered, they have self-reliantly established four primary schools and one agricultural middle school, enabling many children of poor and lower-middle peasants who were previously unable to attend school to enroll in primary and middle schools. The poor and lower-middle peasants praise these schools for being set up at their doorsteps, cultivating good successors for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the process of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyudou Production Brigade running their own schools, they experienced a fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines. This brigade is a remote mountainous village with many mountains and gullies. The entire brigade covers an area of more than twenty li, with eleven production teams and more than three hundred households scattered in thirty-one gullies. Before liberation, the poor and lower-middle peasants suffered greatly from illiteracy. Shortly after liberation, according to the demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, four primary schools were established here, and most of the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants were able to attend school. However, soon, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party promoted the "centralized schooling" and "standardized schooling" revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, abolishing three of the original four primary schools, leaving only one central primary school in Baiyudou. The schools were centralized, making it difficult for students from outlying villages to attend. Every day, they had to cross several mountains and gullies, traveling tens of li round trip. At the same time, the schools pushed the revisionist black goods of "grades first" and "academics first," using examinations, promotions, and other means to force many children of poor and lower-middle peasants to drop out or repeat grades. Out of more than three hundred school-age children in the entire brigade, only over a hundred regularly attended school. The more than one hundred households of poor and lower-middle peasants in the four production teams of Nansijiaz and others, which are far from the central school, had no graduates from the lower primary school in eight years. Seeing their children being shut out of the school gates, the poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said, "Whose idea is this? If this kind of school continues, it will do away with the dictatorship of the proletariat."

In 1964, Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause reached this remote mountainous area, and the poor and lower-middle peasants were all elated. They said, "If we don't manage the school again, it will turn revisionist." So, they rose up to rebel against the revisionist educational line and elected representatives to establish the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School Management Committee, seizing the school battlefield. They broke the old frameworks of "centralized schooling" and "standardized schooling" and decided to establish people-run primary schools, bringing schools to the doorsteps of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Just at this time, a capitalist-roader from above jumped out and viciously said, "People-run schools do not guarantee quality and will not be approved!" The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyudou Production Brigade said, "You don't approve, but we will still run them!" They did not listen to the evil and, with one breath, in the autumn of 1964, self-reliantly and strenuously established four people-run primary schools in the four remote production teams of Sijiaz, Wulandaba, Zhangbashigou, and Halahushao. To solve the problem of students studying middle school locally, they also established an agricultural middle school. The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School Management Committee, on the one hand, educated the revolutionary teachers of the original central school, mobilizing them to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, going to the hardships of the mountains to run schools for the poor and lower-middle peasants. On the other hand, they selected seven poor and lower-middle peasant commune members with high class consciousness from the brigade to teach in the people-run primary schools and agricultural middle school, ensuring that the leadership of the schools was firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. After the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies blew cold wind again, proposing the fallacy of "withdrawing the extended classes and returning to the central school," slandering the teachers of people-run schools as those who had not been promoted to school and as teachers who knew only half a character, attempting to strangle the new thing of people-run schools. The evil wind blown by the class enemies was quickly repelled by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students. Because these people-run schools were in line with the wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they became more prosperous and more consolidated, increasing the number of students enrolled in the entire brigade from the original over one hundred to over three hundred.

After the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Baiyudou Production Brigade managed the schools and directly engaged in teaching work, they boldly reformed the old educational system, teaching content, and teaching methods, establishing a set of school management systems adapted to the needs of the three great revolutionary struggles. They determined that the main course should be the works of Chairman Mao, with class education as the basic course. In political classes, they added international and domestic current affairs and the Party's various policies in rural areas; in language classes, they added farmhouse characters, local teaching materials, rural application documents, and calligraphy; in mathematics classes, they added abacus, accounting, and statistics; in agricultural knowledge classes, in addition to selecting some teaching materials compiled by relevant units, they compiled specialized teaching materials on water and soil conservation, slope management, afforestation, crop cultivation, and plant protection based on the needs of local agricultural production and future development plans. In teaching methods, they changed the previous practice of teachers lecturing and students listening, inviting old poor peasants and workers with deep bitterness to teach class struggle, inviting team cadres to lecture on the revolutionary and production situation, inviting militia platoon leaders to teach the Four Firsts and the Three-Eighths Style, and conducting military training. They organized students to participate in the class struggle of the production teams. Each production team was also equipped with experienced old farmers and revolutionary teachers and students who went to the fields together to teach and learn in labor, implementing the good learning style of combining theory with practice. The poor and lower-middle peasants said with satisfaction, "The old schools taught all kinds of flowers and grasses, which were of no use when learned. Today, we have compiled our own textbooks, which are all practical things, and learning them is very useful."

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School Management Committee of this brigade paid great attention to the thought revolutionization of teachers in the process of running schools. On the one hand, they organized teachers to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and on the other hand, they organized them to participate in local class struggles and production struggles, greatly enhancing the teachers' class feelings of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many teachers put down their airs and directly engaged in production struggles. After the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the schools, they were most satisfied with the changes in their own children. The students had limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, loved socialism, cared for the collective, rooted in the countryside, and actively participated in labor. During the Cultural Revolution, the over three hundred students in the entire brigade played a vanguard role, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they rebelled against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, resolutely fought against class enemies, bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and became the backbone of the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside. Seeing that a new generation was growing up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants happily said, "With such young people to take over, we old ones can rest assured!"

Chairman Mao recently pointed out, "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyudou Production Brigade studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and were greatly inspired. They seriously summarized the experience of managing schools by the poor and lower-middle peasants over the past four years, affirmed the achievements, and found the gaps. They realized that the poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools should first manage all the powers of the school. Under the leadership of the brigade revolutionary committee, they changed the original school management committee into the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School Management Committee. The deputy director of the brigade revolutionary committee and the director of the poor and lower-middle peasants' congress served as the director and deputy directors of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School Management Committee, forming a new revolutionary leadership team. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "shortening the school system," changing the six-year primary school system to a five-year continuous system and the six-year three-three segmented middle school system to a four-year continuous system, basically ensuring that the children of poor and lower-middle peasants did not travel more than three li to attend primary school and did not leave the brigade to attend middle school. Students studied at school, worked in the teams, and lived and ate at home, which was very popular with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    白玉都大队贫下中农狠批修正主义教育路线
    打破“正规化”老框框　自力更生办学校
    据新华社沈阳二十五日电　辽宁省阜新蒙古族自治县国强公社白玉都大队的贫下中农，在毛主席的无产阶级教育路线指引下，破除所谓“集中办学”、“正规化办学”的修正主义教育路线，在社员分散居住的偏僻山村，自力更生地办起了四所小学和一所农业中学，使许多过去不能入学的贫下中农子女入了小学和中学。贫下中农称赞这些学校办到了自己的家门口，培养了贫下中农的好后代。
    白玉都大队贫下中农自己办学的过程中，经历了两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争。这个大队是一个山多沟多的偏僻山村。全大队方圆二十多里，十一个生产队，三百多户社员分散居住在三十一个沟沟岔岔里。解放前，贫下中农吃尽了没有文化的苦头。解放初，根据贫下中农的要求，这里建立了四所小学，贫下中农子女多数上了学。可是不久，党内一小撮走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫“集中办学”、“正规化办学”的修正主义教育路线，把原来的四所小学砍掉了三所，只剩下白玉都一所中心小学。学校集中了，外屯的学生上学十分困难，每天都得翻几座山，过几道沟，往返十几里路。同时，学校中又推行“分数挂帅”、“智育第一”的修正主义黑货，以考试、升级等手段，迫使大批贫下中农子女退学和留级。全大队三百多名学龄儿童中，经常上学的只有一百多名。离中心小学远的南四家子等四个生产队一百多户贫下中农的子女，在八年中没有一名高小毕业生。贫下中农看到自己的子女被拒绝在学校大门之外，气愤地说：“这是什么人的主张？这样的学校再办下去，把无产阶级专政都给搞没了。”
    一九六四年，毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的指示，传到了这个偏僻的山区，贫下中农无不欢欣鼓舞。他们说，这学校咱再不管，就要变修了。于是，他们起来造了修正主义教育路线的反，并推出代表建立了贫下中农办学委员会，占领学校阵地。他们打破了“集中办学”、“正规化办学”的老框框，决定举办民办小学，把学校办到贫下中农家门口去。就在这个时候，上边有个走资派跳了出来恶狠狠地说：“民办，不保证质量，不批准！”白玉都大队贫下中农说：“你不批，我们也照样办！”他们就是不听邪，一鼓作气，一九六四年秋天，自力更生，奋发图强，在四家子、勿兰大巴、张把什沟、哈拉户稍四个边远生产队办起了四所民办小学。为了解决学生就地读中学的问题，还办起了一所农业中学。贫下中农办学委员会一方面对原中心小学的革命教师进行教育，动员他们走毛主席指引的道路，到艰苦的山沟为贫下中农办学，一方面从大队中选出七名阶级觉悟高的贫下中农社员分别到民办小学和农业中学担任教师，使学校的领导权牢牢地掌握在贫下中农手里。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，一小撮阶级敌人又吹起冷风，提出“收回下伸班，重归中心校”的谬论，诬蔑民办学校的教师是没升上学的“漏子”，是识两个半字的先生，妄图扼杀民办学校这个新生事物。阶级敌人煽起的这股妖风，很快被广大贫下中农、革命师生击退了。由于这些民办学校很合贫下中农的心愿，越办越兴旺，越办越巩固，全大队入学的学生由原来的一百多名增加到了三百多名。
    白玉都大队广大贫下中农管理学校并直接担任了教学工作后，大胆改革了旧教育制度、教学内容、教学方法，建立了一套适应三大革命斗争需要的管理学校的制度。他们根据农村三大革命斗争的需要，确定以毛主席著作为主课，阶级教育为基础课。政治课中增添了国际、国内时事和党在农村中的各项方针政策；语文课中增添了庄户字，乡土教材，农村应用文和毛笔字；数学课中增添了珠算、会计、统计；农业知识课中，除选用一部分有关单位编写的教材外，由老贫农和技术干部根据当地农业生产的需要和今后发展规划，编写成水土保持、坡地治理、植树造林、作物栽培和植物保护等专题教材。在教学方法上，改变了过去那种教师讲、学生听的做法，请苦大仇深的老贫农、老工人上阶级斗争课，请队干部讲革命和生产形势，请民兵连长讲四个第一、三八作风，进行军事训练。组织学生参加生产队的阶级斗争。每个生产队还配备有经验的老农和革命师生一起到田间，在劳动中教学，贯彻了理论联系实际的好学风。贫下中农满意地说：“过去的学校教的都是些花花草草，学了没什么用。今天我们自己编的课本都是实际的事儿，学了就顶用。”
    这个大队的贫下中农办学委员会在办学过程中，对教师的思想革命化抓得很紧。他们一方面组织教师活学活用毛泽东思想，一方面组织他们参加当地的阶级斗争和生产斗争，大大增强了教师为贫下中农服务的阶级感情。许多教师都放下了架子，直接投身到生产斗争中。贫下中农管理学校以后，最满意的是自己子女的变化。学生们无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，热爱社会主义，关心集体，扎根农村，积极参加劳动。在文化大革命运动中，全大队三百多名学生，绝大多数都发挥了先锋作用，他们和贫下中农一起，造了党内一小撮走资派的反，坚决地和阶级敌人作斗争，勇敢地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，成了农村三大革命运动的骨干力量。贫下中农看到在毛泽东思想抚育下，亲手培养的新的一代在成长，高兴地说：“有了这样的青年人接班，我们老一辈就放心了！”
    毛主席最近指出：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”白玉都大队贫下中农学习了毛主席这一最新指示，受到了极大鼓舞。他们认真总结了四年来贫下中农管理学校的经验，肯定了成绩，找出了差距。他们认识到：贫下中农管理学校，首要是管好学校一切大权。在大队革委会领导下，他们将原办学委员会改为贫下中农管理学校委员会。大队革委会副主任兼贫下中农管理学校委员会主任，贫代会主任和学校革命领导干部任副主任，组成一个新的革命化的领导班子。他们遵照毛主席“学制要缩短”的教导，把小学六年制改为五年一贯制，把中学六年三三分段制改为四年一贯制，基本做到了贫下中农子女念小学走读不超过三华里，念中学不出大队。学生读书在校，劳动回队，食宿在家，很受贫下中农欢迎。
