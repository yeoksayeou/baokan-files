Only by striking at the crux can one establish the fundamentals. The Shenyang Smelting Plant focuses on revolutionary criticism during the struggle, criticism, and reform.

The revolutionary workers of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a broad and deep movement to criticize the revisionist line of running enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. This has significantly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers, powerfully promoting the struggle, criticism, and reform throughout the plant, and presenting a completely new face of revolutionary production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 29th. The revolutionary workers of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have focused on revolutionary criticism during the struggle, criticism, and reform. They have thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of running enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and have firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The plant's revolutionary and production work has taken on a completely new appearance. Revolutionary workers have deeply felt through practice that revolutionary criticism is the key to carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, combine the two-line struggle in the plant with actual conditions, and launch a broad and deep movement to criticize the revisionist line of running enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. This will raise the two-line struggle consciousness of the workers. At the same time, revolutionary criticism must focus on the key issues where the revisionist line of running enterprises has the deepest influence and the greatest impact. Only by criticizing at the crux can one establish the fundamentals.

Revolutionary criticism is the key to carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform.

“If you don’t criticize well, you can’t reform,” this is the experience gained by the revolutionary workers of the Shenyang Smelting Plant. When this plant first began to streamline its organization, the revolutionary committee organized a group of people who spent all day in the office, drafting plans and arranging personnel. After a month, they still hadn’t finalized the streamlining plan. Workers pointed out, “If you don’t carry out criticism and eliminate the influence of the revisionist line of running enterprises, how can you streamline the organization well by just sitting in the office?” The workers’ comments hit the nail on the head. The plant revolutionary committee immediately, together with all the revolutionary workers, restudied Chairman Mao’s instructions on streamlining the organization and learned from the experience of Lingbao County. They fully mobilized the masses, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and focused on exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev in the construction of political power. Revolutionary criticism greatly raised the two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers. Everyone proposed plans and measures, and in less than half a month, the plant completed the task of reforming the organization and streamlining personnel.

The plant revolutionary committee deeply realized from this incident that the key to carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform lies in raising the two-line struggle consciousness of the workers through revolutionary criticism. If the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev is not thoroughly criticized, Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line cannot be well implemented; only by criticizing deeply can one reform well.

Fully mobilize the masses so that everyone receives education through revolutionary criticism.

The revolutionary criticism in the Shenyang Smelting Plant has gone through a process from shallow to deep, from a few people to a broader mass movement. At the beginning, because the importance of fully mobilizing the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism was not fully recognized, the plant once had a situation where writing big-character posters for criticism relied on “scholars,” holding meetings for criticism relied on “eloquent speakers,” making the revolutionary criticism cold and lifeless. The criticism of the class enemy was not thorough, and the masses did not receive deep education, so the struggle, criticism, and reform were not carried out well. Later, the plant revolutionary committee seriously studied Chairman Mao’s teaching, “Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them.” They fully mobilized the masses and relied on them to carry out revolutionary criticism. The plant revolutionary committee paid special attention to mobilizing old workers to repeatedly educate the masses on the history of the two-line struggle in the factory. Through exposing one fact of the revisionist line of running enterprises, learning one of Chairman Mao’s teachings, and criticizing one fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, they continuously deepened the revolutionary criticism and greatly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers. They deeply felt that the deeper the revolutionary criticism goes, the more hatred there is towards the capitalist-roaders, and the greater the self-education.

Now, the workshops, teams, dormitories, and sanatoriums of the smelting plant have all become battlefields for revolutionary criticism. The forms of revolutionary criticism have also become more lively and vivid, such as on-site criticism meetings, mobile criticism meetings, and joint criticism with other units.

Revolutionary criticism must be closely combined with the actual situation of the factory to strike at the crux and establish the fundamentals.

During the struggle, criticism, and reform, the Shenyang Smelting Plant thoroughly criticized the revisionist line of running enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and firmly established Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, striking at the crux and establishing the fundamentals.

The plant revolutionary committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao’s teaching, “In any process where there are many contradictions, there must be one principal contradiction that plays a leading and decisive role,” realized that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents had implemented a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines on the industrial front. In the revolutionary criticism, they must, according to the specific situation of the unit, grasp the key points and criticize them thoroughly. Only in this way can Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line be firmly established in the unit. They carefully analyzed the history of the two-line struggle in the smelting plant over the past decade and believed that “expert management” was the crux of the plant’s capitalist-roaders implementing the Chinese Khrushchev’s counter-revolutionary revisionist line of running enterprises. Workers pointed out sharply, “The capitalist-roaders used ‘expert management’ to formulate complicated rules and regulations, and through means such as control, restriction, and oppression, they took away our power. If we don’t smash ‘expert management,’ we workers cannot be masters of the factory.”

The plant revolutionary committee grasped this key issue and led the revolutionary workers to carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism around “expert management.” They actively applied Mao Zedong Thought, closely combined the two-line struggle in the plant with actual conditions, and thoroughly criticized the crux of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of running enterprises. They criticized those “experts” and “authorities” who were praised to the skies by the capitalist-roaders, making them lose their arrogance, greatly boosting the morale of the working class, and thoroughly suppressing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

Revolutionary criticism has greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of the people. The two-line struggle consciousness and the self-awareness of working for the proletarian revolutionary cause of the workers have never been as high as today. The Shenyang Smelting Plant is undergoing a thorough transformation, and the revolutionary workers are advancing bravely along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao.

    只有破在要害处，才能立在根本上
    沈阳冶炼厂在斗批改中狠抓革命大批判
    广大革命职工以毛泽东思想为武器，结合本厂两条路线斗争的实际，广泛深入地开展了一场批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义办企业路线的群众运动，大大提高了革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了全厂的斗批改，全厂革命生产呈现崭新面貌
    据新华社沈阳二十九日电　沈阳冶炼厂广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗、批、改中狠抓革命大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义办企业路线，大立毛主席无产阶级革命路线，全厂革命和生产出现了崭新面貌。广大革命职工在实践中深深体会到：革命大批判，是搞好斗、批、改的关键。必须充分发动群众，结合本厂两条路线斗争的实际，广泛深入地开展一场批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义办企业路线的革命群众运动，提高广大职工的两条路线斗争觉悟。同时，革命大批判必须抓住修正主义办企业路线中流毒最深、影响最大的关键性问题，只有批在要害处，才能立在根本上。
    革命大批判是搞好斗、批、改的关键
    “批不好，改不了”，这是沈阳冶炼厂革命职工从实践中得来的体会。这个厂开始搞精兵简政时，厂革委会组织了一班人马，整天坐在屋子里，设方案，摆人头，搞了一个月也没把精简方案定下来。工人们提意见说：“你们不搞大批判，不肃清修正主义办企业路线的流毒，天天关在屋里搞精兵简政，怎么能搞得好！”工人的意见说到了点子上。厂革命委员会马上同全厂革命职工一道，重新学习了毛主席有关精兵简政的教导，学习了灵宝县精兵简政的经验，充分发动群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，集中地对中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线的罪行，展开了揭发和批判。革命大批判大大提高了广大革命职工的两条路线斗争觉悟，他们人人提方案，摆措施，不到半个月全厂就完成了改革机构和精简人员的任务。
    厂革命委员会从这件事中深深认识到，搞好斗、批、改，关键在于通过革命大批判，提高广大职工的两条路线斗争觉悟。不把中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线批深批透，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就不能很好得到贯彻；只有批得深，才能改得好。
    充分动员群众，使广大群众在革命大批判中都受到教育
    沈阳冶炼厂的革命大批判，经历了一个由浅入深，由少数人搞到具有越来越广泛的群众性的过程。开始时，因为对广泛发动群众开展革命大批判的重要性认识不足，这个厂一度出现过写大字报批判靠“秀才”，开大会批判靠“口才”，把革命大批判搞得冷冷清清，对阶级敌人打得不狠，广大群众没有受到深刻的教育，斗、批、改也搞得不好的情况。后来厂革委会认真学习了毛主席“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争”的教导，放手发动群众，依靠群众来搞革命大批判。厂革委会特别注意发动老工人在群众中反复开展工厂两条路线斗争史的教育，通过揭发一件反革命修正主义路线办企业的事实，学习毛主席的一条教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个谬论，把革命大批判不断推向深入，大大提高了革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们深有体会地说，革命大批判越深入，对走资派越仇恨，对自己的教育越大。
    现在，冶炼厂的车间、班组、宿舍、疗养所，到处是革命大批判的战场。革命大批判的形式也越来越生动活泼，如现场批判会、流动批判会、和外单位联合批判等等。
    革命大批判紧密结合工厂实际，才能破在要害处，立在根本上
    沈阳冶炼厂在斗、批、改中，大破中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的修正主义办企业路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，破在要害处，立在根本上。
    沈阳冶炼厂革委会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用”的教导，认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在工业战线上推行了一整套反革命修正主义路线，在革命大批判中，必须根据本单位的具体情况，抓住要害，批深批透。这样，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能在本单位立得牢。他们认真分析了冶炼厂十几年来两条路线斗争的历史，认为“专家治厂”是这个厂走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义办企业路线的要害。工人们一针见血地指出：“走资派用‘专家治厂’制定了烦琐的规章制度，通过管、卡、压等手段，把我们的权给夺去了。不砸烂‘专家治厂’我们工人阶级就当不了家，作不了主。”
    厂革委会抓住这个要害问题，带领革命职工围绕着“专家治厂”开展了一场深入持久的革命大批判。他们活学活用毛泽东思想，紧紧结合本厂两条路线斗争实际，狠批反革命修正主义办企业路线的要害，把那些被走资派捧上了天的资产阶级“专家”、“权威”，批得威风扫地，大长了工人阶级志气，大灭了资产阶级威风。
    革命的大批判，大大促进了人的思想革命化。广大职工的两条路线斗争觉悟、为无产阶级革命事业劳动的自觉性，从来没有象今天这样高。沈阳冶炼厂正在经历着一场翻天覆地的变化，广大革命职工正在沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇前进。
