The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Zhejiang University, together with revolutionary students and teachers, have been conducting "recall hardships and sweetness" activities, making class education a key course for the re-education of intellectuals. This has raised the class consciousness and the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary students and teachers, effectively promoting the school's struggle, criticism, and reform. The entire school presents a vibrant revolutionary scene.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, October 14th: The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Zhejiang University has made class education a key course for the re-education of intellectuals. Together with old workers who have deep grievances and revolutionary students and teachers from worker-peasant families, they have widely conducted "recall hardships and sweetness" activities. This has raised the class consciousness and the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary students and teachers, effectively promoting the school's struggle, criticism, and reform. The entire school presents a vibrant revolutionary scene.

When the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team conducted class education for the broad students and teachers, they paid special attention to discovering typical examples and using them to conduct vivid class education. In early September, soon after the workers' propaganda team entered the school, they received a large, dirty package from the trash bin, containing twenty-seven items of clothing, including shirts, socks, and gloves, some new and some old. What was this about? Upon closer inspection, they found a letter in one of the pockets with the name of the student who had discarded the package, a student named Xiao Luo from the Class of 1967 in the Foreign Languages Department. This raised a thought-provoking question: Why did she wear these clothes when she entered the school, but discarded them when she left? Many old workers expressed their sorrow: "Xiao Luo did not just discard a few pieces of clothing; she discarded the qualities of the working people!" "This is the harm caused by the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, making her forget her roots. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to push the youth onto the dark road of revisionism, but we, the working class, will pull them onto the revolutionary path guided by Chairman Mao!"

The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team decided to use this typical case to conduct class education for the entire school. They studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instruction of "not understanding what class is, not understanding what exploitation is, means not understanding revolution." Through these studies, everyone realized that conducting class education is necessary to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to meet the needs of class struggle, to help intellectuals thoroughly change their old ideas, and to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform, pushing the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. The workers used this package of clothes to hold an exhibition titled "Angry Denunciation of the Heinous Crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in Promoting the Revisionist Educational Line," organizing the students and teachers on campus to visit.

With the cooperation of the People's Liberation Army, the workers' propaganda team then organized denunciation meetings, "recall hardships and sweetness" meetings, and "hardship meals," widely conducting activities to recall and compare the past. Old workers with deep grievances used their own bitter family histories to conduct class education for the entire school. Denunciation meetings and "recall hardships and sweetness" meetings were held repeatedly from the class level to the entire school. A total of twenty-one old workers took the stage to recall hardships and sweetness. Many old workers even wore the patched and mended clothes from the old society to speak from personal experience. Ding Huanzhang, an old worker with several decades of work experience, specially brought from home a "hundred-patched" coat from the old society, which he had kept to educate his descendants, and bitter vegetables from over ten miles away. Holding the "hundred-patched" coat in one hand and the bitter vegetables in the other, he tearfully denounced the various oppressions of the old society on the laboring people and emotionally recounted how Chairman Mao saved him from the sea of suffering to live a happy life. He earnestly admonished the younger generation not to forget Chairman Mao after liberation. The old workers' recalling of hardships and sweetness moved the Red Guards and revolutionary students to tears. Many Red Guards from worker and poor peasant families angrily denounced the harm caused by the Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of the revisionist educational line and voluntarily examined their own changes in thought after entering the university. They said, "After entering the university, it was truly 'one year of rusticity, two years of foreign influence, three years of looking down on workers and poor peasants, our parents.' Thinking about it now, we truly feel sorry for the workers and poor peasants, and for the great leader Chairman Mao!" Some young comrades who previously thought they had no old ideas because they were "born in worker-peasant families and grew up under the red flag" also strengthened their urgent desire to change their worldview, deeply feeling that the working class is the best teacher sent by Chairman Mao. The broad revolutionary students and teachers all expressed that they would never forget the class bitterness, always remember the blood debt, resolutely accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, seriously change their worldview, follow Chairman Mao, and forever make revolution.

The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Zhejiang University also conducted class education for the broad revolutionary students and teachers through the widespread establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and heart-to-heart talks. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various classes, grades, and departments, the "three recalls, three comparisons, three examinations" activities were carried out, which are: recalling the bitterness of the old society, comparing the sweetness of the new society, and examining class stance; recalling the persecution of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and the revisionist educational line, comparing the wisdom and greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and examining one's performance in the struggle between the two lines; recalling Chairman Mao and the Party's cultivation, comparing one's loyalty to Chairman Mao, and examining whether one follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Through recalling, comparing, and examining, the broad students and teachers were inspired to hate the old society, love the new society; hate the Chinese Khrushchev, love the great leader Chairman Mao; hate the revisionist educational line, love Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line; hate the bourgeoisie, love the working class. They decided to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and decided to, under the leadership of the working class, thoroughly change old ideas, thoroughly smash the old educational system, and establish a new proletarian educational system. The old workers stationed in the Foreign Languages Department also went to Xiao Luo's home three times to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals. They washed the clothes Xiao Luo discarded clean and delivered them to her door. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings together with Xiao Luo and recalled hardships and sweetness together. The workers seriously and sincerely told Xiao Luo, "You did not just discard a few pieces of clothing; you discarded the revolutionary soul! Today, what we bring is not just a few pieces of clothing, but the great Mao Zedong Thought!" The old workers' earnest words deeply educated Xiao Luo. She expressed her determination to go to the farm to be a good farmer, accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly change her old ideas.

The workers' propaganda team's focus on class education effectively promoted the school's struggle, criticism, and reform. The broad revolutionary students and teachers closely combined recalling hardships and sweetness with deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, fiercely denouncing and criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the revisionist educational line, further exposing the class struggle cover in the school. Revolutionary students and teachers decided to, under the leadership of the working class, carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. Now, the entire school has launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform, and the entire campus presents a revolutionary scene of "unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness."

    进驻杭州大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队和革命师生一起忆苦思甜
    把阶级教育作为对知识分子进行再教育的一门主课
    提高了广大革命师生的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了学校的斗批改，全校呈现出生气勃勃的革命景象
    据新华社杭州十四日电　进驻杭州大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队把阶级教育作为对知识分子进行再教育的一门主课，由苦大仇深的老工人和工农家庭出身的革命师生一起广泛开展忆苦思甜活动，提高了广大革命师生的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了学校的斗、批、改，全校呈现出生气勃勃的革命景象。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队在对广大师生进行阶级教育时，非常注意发现典型，运用典型进行生动的阶级教育。九月上旬，工人宣传队刚进校不久，收到一个从垃圾箱里拾来的又大又脏的包裹，里面尽是衣服、袜子、手套，有单有棉，有旧有新，共有二十七件。这是怎么回事？大家仔细一翻，发现衣袋里有封信，写着丢掉这包衣服的学生的名字。这个包裹原来是外语系六七届毕业生小罗丢的。这是多么发人深思的问题啊！工人同志围着这堆衣服，议论开了：为什么她穿着这些衣服进校，而在出校的时候便不要了呢？许多老工人痛心地说：“小罗丢掉的不仅仅是几件衣服，而是丢掉了劳动人民的品质！”“这是中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线对青年的毒害，使她忘了本。中国赫鲁晓夫要把青年往修正主义的黑路上推，我们工人阶级就要把他们拉到毛主席指引的革命大道上来！”
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队决定抓住这个典型事例，对全校师生进行阶级教育。他们学习了伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，学习了林彪副主席“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命”的指示。通过学习，大家认识到上好阶级教育这门主课，是落实毛主席最新指示的需要，是阶级斗争的需要，是帮助知识分子彻底改变旧思想的需要，是认真搞好斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的需要。工人同志用这包衣服办了一个“愤怒控诉中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线的滔天罪行”展览会，组织在校师生参观。
    工人宣传队在人民解放军的配合下，接着组织了诉苦会，忆苦思甜会，吃忆苦饭，广泛开展回忆对比活动。苦大仇深的老工人用自己的苦难家史对全校师生进行阶级教育。诉苦会、忆苦思甜会由班级到全校，连续地反复地召开，先后有二十一位老工人上台忆苦思甜。许多老工人还穿起了旧社会千补百纳的破衣服，向革命师生现身说法。有几十年工龄的老工人丁焕章，特地从家里拿来旧社会穿过几十年、现在留着教育后代的“百挂衣”，从十多里外找来旧社会吃的苦苦菜，他一手拿着“百挂衣”，一手拿着苦苦菜，含泪控诉了旧社会对劳动人民的种种迫害，激动地叙述了毛主席把他从苦海里救出来过着幸福生活，谆谆叮嘱青年一代翻身不忘毛主席。老工人忆苦思甜，使红卫兵小将、革命师生感动得热泪满眶。许多工人、贫下中农家庭出身的红卫兵小将，满腔怒火地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害，自觉地检查了自己进大学后的思想变化。他们说，进大学后，真是“一年‘土’，两年‘洋’，三年瞧不起工人、贫下中农亲爹娘”。现在想想，真对不起工人、贫下中农，对不起伟大领袖毛主席！有些过去认为自己“生在工农家庭，长在红旗下”没有啥旧思想的小将，也增强了改造世界观的迫切愿望，深深地感到工人阶级是毛主席派来的最好的老师。广大革命师生纷纷表示，要不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，坚决接受工农兵的再教育，认真改造世界观，紧跟毛主席，永远闹革命。
    驻杭州大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队还在普遍举办毛泽东思想学习班和广泛开展谈心活动中，对广大革命师生进行阶级教育。在各班、级、系开办的毛泽东思想学习班里，展开了“三忆三比三查”活动，就是：忆旧社会苦，比新社会甜，查阶级立场；忆资产阶级反动路线、修正主义教育路线的迫害，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的英明伟大，查自己在两条路线斗争中的表现；忆毛主席和党对自己的培养，比自己对毛主席的忠心，查自己是否紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。通过忆、比、查，激发了广大师生员工痛恨旧社会，热爱新社会；痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫，热爱伟大领袖毛主席；痛恨修正主义教育路线，热爱毛主席无产阶级教育路线；痛恨资产阶级，热爱工人阶级的感情。他们决心永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，决心在工人阶级领导下，彻底改变旧思想，彻底砸烂旧教育制度，创立新的无产阶级教育制度。工人宣传队驻外语系的老工人，还先后三次到丢掉衣服的小罗家里，宣传毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示。他们把小罗丢掉的衣服洗得干干净净，送上门去。他们同小罗一起学习毛主席的教导，一起忆苦思甜。工人同志严肃而又诚恳地对小罗说：“你丢掉的不是几件衣服，而是革命的灵魂！今天我们送来的不光是几件衣服，而是伟大的毛泽东思想！”老工人语重心长的话，深深地教育了小罗。她表示，决心到农场当好农民，接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变自己的旧思想。
    工人宣传队狠抓阶级教育，有力地促进了学校的斗、批、改。广大革命师生把忆苦思甜和深入开展革命大批判紧密结合起来，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线的罪行，进一步揭开学校的阶级斗争盖子。革命师生们决心在工人阶级领导下，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。现在全校掀起了斗、批、改的高潮，整个校园出现了“团结、紧张、严肃、活泼”的革命景象。
