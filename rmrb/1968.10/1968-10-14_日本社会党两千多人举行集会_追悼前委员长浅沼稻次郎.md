The Japanese Socialist Party held a rally in Tokyo's Hibiya Public Hall on October 12 to mourn Asanuma Inejiro, the former chairman who was killed by right-wing thugs in the service of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries during the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" eight years ago. Over 2,000 Socialist Party members and sympathizers attended the rally.

At the rally, Socialist Party Chairman Narita Tomomi gave a speech. He said, "Asanuma fought to his death shouting, 'U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Japan and China.' It has become increasingly clear that the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' is a dangerous, aggressive military alliance."

Narita said, "We are facing a new high tide in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.' We swear to inherit Asanuma's will and carry the struggle against the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' to the end."

At the meeting, commentator Matsuoka Yōko gave a speech. She said, "Asanuma was killed by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries because he advocated that 'U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Japan and China.' This clearly shows that U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries are terrified of China and terrified of the unity of the peoples of Japan and China!"

Matsuoka condemned the Soviet revisionists for colluding with U.S. imperialism and condemned the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique for shamelessly engaging in anti-China activities.

Other speakers at the rally included representatives of farmers and citizens who are currently engaged in the struggle against U.S. military bases. They unanimously expressed their firm resolve to fight against U.S. military bases and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    日本社会党两千多人举行集会
    追悼前委员长浅沼稻次郎
    新华社十二日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本社会党十二日在东京日比谷公会堂举行集会，追悼八年前在反对日美“安全条约”斗争中被美日反动派的走狗右翼暴徒杀死的日本社会党前委员长浅沼稻次郎。两千多名社会党党员和同情者参加了集会。
    在集会上，社会党委员长成田知巳讲了话。他说：“浅沼高喊着‘美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人’而斗争到死。日美‘安全条约’是一个危险的侵略性军事同盟，这越来越明显了。”
    成田说：“我们面临着反对日美‘安全条约’斗争的新高潮。我们誓将继承浅沼的遗志，把反对日美‘安全条约’的斗争进行到底。”
    在会上，评论家松冈洋子发表了讲话，她说：“浅沼因为主张‘美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人’而被美日反动派所杀害。这明显地证明，美帝国主义和日本反动派对中国怕得要命，对日中两国人民的团结怕得要死！”
    松冈谴责苏修同美帝勾结，还谴责日共宫本修正主义集团无耻地进行反华活动。
    在集会上讲话的，还有一些农民和市民的代表，他们正在进行反对美军基地的斗争。他们一致表示了为反对美国军事基地、反对日美“安全条约”而进行斗争的坚强意志。
