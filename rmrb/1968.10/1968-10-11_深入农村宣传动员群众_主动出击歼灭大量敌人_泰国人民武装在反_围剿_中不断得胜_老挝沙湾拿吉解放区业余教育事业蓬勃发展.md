	Thai People's Armed Forces Achieve Continuous Victories in Countering "Encirclement and Suppression"

	According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the people's armed forces in various parts of Thailand, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, have recently continuously foiled the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the Thanom military clique and have actively annihilated the enemy's fighting force, achieving new victories.

	The radio station reported that, according to incomplete statistics, the people's armed forces in various parts of Thailand carried out 63 proactive strikes and counterattacks against the enemy in August, annihilating a batch of enemies and executing a batch of enemy spies.

	The radio station said that the people's armed forces in Chiang Khong County, Chiang Rai Province in northern Thailand have recently engaged in fierce battles with reactionary military and police forces sent to suppress the people. In a fierce battle on September 5, the people's armed forces wounded eight enemies. The people's armed forces in the northeastern provinces of Nakhon Phanom, Udon Thani, and Kalasin have repeatedly repulsed enemy "encirclement and suppression," and have continuously sent armed propaganda teams into the countryside to mobilize the masses, executing a batch of enemy spies, and receiving enthusiastic support from the broad masses.

	According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the people's armed forces under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand have recently proactively struck the enemy, actively propagated, and mobilized the masses, achieving new victories.

	The radio station reported that, according to incomplete statistics, from June 20 to September 20 over three months, the people and people's armed forces in various parts of Thailand fought 106 battles with the enemy, annihilating nearly 200 enemies, and destroying and damaging multiple enemy aircraft. In addition, the people's armed forces have also entered the countryside 24 times to propagate and mobilize the masses, and executed 14 extremely evil enemy spies, receiving enthusiastic support from the broad masses.

	The People's Education Undertaking in the Liberation Zone of Savannakhet Province in Laos Thrives

	According to a report by the Pathet Lao News Agency, the part-time education undertaking in the liberation zone of Savannakhet Province in Laos has seen new developments.

	According to incomplete statistics, this province currently has 11,928 adults (including more than 5,600 women) participating in part-time literacy classes, a figure that has doubled since the beginning of 1967.

	Now, thousands of women can read and write. In Naban and Sonan villages, residents aged 15 to 45 are all literate.

	Before liberation, 95% of the residents in Savannakhet Province were illiterate, and almost all women were illiterate.

	After liberation, this situation has fundamentally changed. The Lao Patriotic Front and the revolutionary government have organized many literacy classes among the residents to eliminate illiteracy, and have specially set up literacy classes for women with children.
