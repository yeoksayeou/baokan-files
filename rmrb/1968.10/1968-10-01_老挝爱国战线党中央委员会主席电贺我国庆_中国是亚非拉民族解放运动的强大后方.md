		Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Congratulates China on National Day
		China is a Strong Rear Base for National Liberation Movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America

		BEIJING, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has received a congratulatory message from Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, on the occasion of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The full text of the message is as follows:

		To Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Beijing:

		On the occasion of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I, on behalf of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people, and in my personal capacity, extend our warmest greetings and highest respect to the heroic Chinese people led by the great and heroic leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, of the great Communist Party of China.

		Following the success of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, the success of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China constitute a great victory in the history of world revolution and a severe blow to all imperialist systems in the world. This great victory has effectively changed the balance of power in the world, to the advantage of the socialist forces, national liberation forces, democracy, and world peace.

		Over the past 19 years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved many great and brilliant successes in the cause of socialist construction, making China a country with modern industry, modern agriculture, a powerful modern national defense, and advanced science and technology, and becoming a nuclear power. All this has caused great alarm among all imperialist countries in the world, while bringing great joy to all oppressed and exploited peoples.

		Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has become a solid bulwark and a strong rear base for the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and in particular, for the struggle of the Lao people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

		The Chinese people are reliable and close comrades-in-arms of the Lao people. Even during the period when the Lao people, under the leadership of the "Ishara" Front, were fighting against French colonialism, they gave support to the Lao people. Now, they are again supporting the Lao people in their struggle, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, against U.S. aggression.

		The Lao patriotic forces and the Lao people are extremely delighted and enthusiastic in welcoming every major victory achieved by the brotherly Chinese people in their cause of socialist construction, and regard these victories as their own. At the same time, they express their gratitude to the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for their sincere assistance to the Lao people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

		We wish the 700 million Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, even greater brilliance in their cause of building their country and a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

		We wish the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, good health and long life.

		We wish the fighting friendship and unity between the peoples of Laos and China eternal prosperity.

		Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front

    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席电贺我国庆
    中国是亚非拉民族解放运动的强大后方
    新华社三十日讯　中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志，收到了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王发来的祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年的电报。电报全文如下：北京中国共产党中央委员会毛泽东主席：
    值此中华人民共和国“十一”国庆十九周年之际，谨代表老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民，并以我个人的名义，向英勇的中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所领导的、伟大的、英雄的中国人民表示团结友谊和崇高的敬意。
    继苏联十月革命成功之后，中国革命的成功和中华人民共和国的成立，是世界革命史上的巨大胜利，也是对世界上一切帝国主义制度的最沉重的打击。这一巨大胜利有效地改变了世界力量的对比，有利于社会主义力量、民族解放力量、民主和世界和平。
    十九年来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，中国人民在社会主义建设事业中取得了许多巨大的、辉煌的成就，使中国成为具有现代工业、现代农业、强大的现代化国防和先进的科学技术的国家，并成为核大国。所有这些，使世界上一切帝国主义国家感到十分恐慌，而使世界上一切被压迫、被剥削的人民感到欢欣鼓舞。
    中华人民共和国自成立以来，已经成为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取民族解放运动，特别是老挝人民抗美救国斗争的坚固长城和强大后方。
    中国人民是老挝人民可靠的亲密战友。远在老挝人民在“伊沙拉”阵线领导下抗击法国殖民主义者的时期就给予老挝人民以支援。现在，又支援了老挝人民在老挝爱国战线党领导下进行的抗击美国侵略者的斗争。
    老挝爱国力量和老挝人民极其欢欣、热烈地欢呼兄弟的中国人民在社会主义建设事业中所取得的每一个重大胜利，并把这些胜利当做是自己的胜利。同时对给予老挝人民抗美救国斗争以真诚援助的中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民表示感谢。
    敬祝七亿中国人民在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在建设祖国的事业中取得更加辉煌的胜利，并取得无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    敬祝中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席健康长寿。
    祝老、中两国人民的战斗友谊和团结万古长青。
              老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席  苏发努冯亲王
                              一九六八年九月二十七日于桑怒
