Workers' representatives from Xiangtan, the hometown of the great leader Chairman Mao, brought two small pine trees to the capital. These trees were cultivated using soil from the area in front of Chairman Mao's residence, watered with water from the pool where Chairman Mao swam, and accompanied by a kumquat tree transplanted from Xiangtan City. They presented these gifts to express the deep loyalty and devotion of the workers of Xiangtan to Chairman Mao. The workers' representatives brought these gifts to the capital to show their everlasting loyalty to Chairman Mao and to express the boundless affection of the Xiangtan workers for their great leader.
