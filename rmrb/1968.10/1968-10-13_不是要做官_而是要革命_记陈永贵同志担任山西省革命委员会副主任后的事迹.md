“Our Communist Party members do not seek officialdom, but to make revolution. We must all have thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a moment detach ourselves from the masses. As long as we do not detach ourselves from the masses, we will surely be victorious.”

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, Chen Yonggui, the Party Secretary of the Dazhai Production Brigade of Xiyang County, Xiyang Commune, Shanxi Province, was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and Chairman of the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee.

Chen Yonggui’s position and duties have changed, but his red heart loyal to Chairman Mao has not changed. His good style of participating in collective production labor has not changed. His good style of maintaining close ties with the masses has not changed. His good style of being thrifty and hardworking has not changed.

He has not discarded the plow handle or the hoe handle in his hands. The thick calluses on his hands have not disappeared. No matter how busy he is with work, he always finds time to work in the fields with the commune members. Sometimes, before leaving for a meeting, he works in the fields for one or two hours. Sometimes, after returning from a meeting in Beijing or Taiyuan, he jumps off the car and goes to work in the fields.

He still lives like the Dazhai commune members, often carrying a bowl to the dining hall to eat with the commune members, sitting on the kang (brick bed) to chat with the commune members, sitting in the fields to study Chairman Mao’s works with the commune members, and participating in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism in the study classes of Mao Zedong Thought with the commune members.

He still wraps a white cloth around his head, wears a half-worn cotton jacket, and wears shoes made at home. The more mud the commune members have on their bodies, the more mud he has on his body.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: “Yonggui has become an official but does not act like one. He is still the same old farmer.”

Position changed, but the character of a laboring people does not change

After Chen Yonggui was elected as Deputy Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and Chairman of the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, he was both happy and worried. The word “fear” began to flash in his mind.

Chen Yonggui is a fearless and selfless person. What does he fear?

Chen Yonggui thought, over the past decade, the Party branch of Dazhai has followed the path indicated by Chairman Mao, adhered to the socialist direction, insisted on collective production, and built a new Dazhai through self-reliance, causing Dazhai to undergo tremendous changes. Dazhai has changed in many ways, but the character of the laboring people of the cadres has not changed. The system of cadres participating in collective production labor has not changed. The style of participating in and leading production has not changed. Because of this, the leading cadre group of Dazhai Brigade has a good mass foundation and has become the revolutionary core leading the broad masses. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the countryside, the leading cadre group of Dazhai Brigade has united with the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, firmly followed Chairman Mao, and advanced victoriously along the revolutionary course indicated by him.

Chen Yonggui thought, from where did the power come? Why were the capitalist-roaders overthrown? In this proletarian cultural revolution, the handful of capitalist-roaders in the former Shanxi Provincial Committee, former Jinzhong Regional Committee, and former Xiyang County Committee who were exposed by us, some were originally hidden bad elements in the Party, and some were people who had become bad after national liberation. The great power of the proletarian revolutionary faction was seized from their hands. He recalled the distant past, during the years of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, many leading cadres of our Party lived, worked, fought, and won victories with the revolutionary masses every day. Everyone shared weal and woe, was intimate, and established a fish-water relationship. This was an important guarantee for us to defeat the enemy and achieve victory in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation under harsh conditions. After national liberation, the status of some comrades, as well as the working environment and material conditions of the leading organs, underwent great changes. In this new situation, most leading comrades were loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, stood the test, and maintained the character of proletarian revolutionaries. However, there were also a small number of people who began to act high and mighty, seek officialdom, and become bureaucrats. Their thoughts, feelings, and class standpoints changed. They long detached themselves from production labor and thus detached themselves from the masses, changing from a fish-water relationship to an oil-water relationship, losing the trust of the masses. The masses had problems but did not want to report them, had words in their hearts but did not want to speak to them. The wisdom and talents of the masses, they could not see or learn. They could not make decisions or find solutions when encountering problems. In this way, they actually long ago lost their leadership over the masses. They detached themselves from the masses but wanted to continue to issue orders on the leading posts, which would lead to erroneous leadership. If you let them lead daily work, they would talk empty words and fire blanks. If you let them command production, they would give blind orders, causing losses to the masses’ production and life, and even leading socialist production and construction to the capitalist restoration road. If you let them lead mass movements, they would practice bourgeois dictatorship over the broad proletarian revolutionary faction. If they continued to change in this way, they would become more and more revisionist, and they would not only not be the bridge for the Party to “concentrate from the masses and persist in the masses,” but would become the stumbling block for the Party to connect with the masses.

In the proletarian cultural revolution, we seized the power from the capitalist-roaders and overthrew the capitalist-roaders because they detached themselves from labor, detached themselves from the masses, detached themselves from hard living, and became revisionists. While we seized the power from the capitalist-roaders, if we did not reform ourselves, forgot labor, forgot the masses, and forgot hard living, we would also walk the old road of the capitalist-roaders! If people became revisionists, the Party would degenerate, the country would change color, and the proletarian dictatorship would be lost! He thought of these things, so his mind produced the “four fears”: fear of detaching from the masses, fear of special treatment, fear of waste, and fear of participating in labor less.

Under the guidance of this “fear” thought, when he first assumed the position of Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee and Chairman of the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, he put forward his requirements to the leading comrades at higher levels: work must be done, but all means must be used to ensure that I can often participate in collective production labor, maintain close ties with the masses, and always maintain the character of the laboring people, never degenerate.

Position elevated, but insistence on participating in collective labor does not change

Chen Yonggui believes that with an elevated position, one should not have a big attitude but should be the same as the commune members and often participate in labor. People often degenerate from laziness, and not participating in labor is the beginning of laziness and the opening of degeneration. Not participating in labor means not being able to connect with the masses and not being able to reform oneself.

Therefore, when Chen Yonggui leaves Dazhai to go out for work or meetings, he often opens the red “Quotations from Chairman Mao” and reads it word by word: “It is necessary to insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers and not lords sitting on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring masses. This is a major fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism.”

He thought in his mind: I am of laboring people’s origin, grew up in bitter water; in the old society, our family had no house, no land, ate chaff and vegetable porridge, and wore ragged clothes. My mother, sister, and younger brother were forced to be sold to escape death, and my father was a long-term laborer for the landlord. When he grew old, he was kicked out by the landlord and hanged himself under a tree in the ancestral tomb with tears of indignation. I started to be a long-term laborer for the landlord at the age of eight and suffered bitterness worse than galangal. The landlords and rich peasants looked down on the poor as if they were not worth a blade of grass. It was Chairman Mao who saved me and showed me a way to stand up and seek liberation; it was the great Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured me, making me grow from an ordinary farmer who only knew how to struggle for personal liberation into a Communist Party member. Without the great leader Chairman Mao, there would be no Chen Yonggui. Chairman Mao’s kindness is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea.

Chen Yonggui read Chairman Mao’s earnest teachings, thought of his own bitter family history, and warned himself: Yonggui, Yonggui! You are of laboring people’s origin, but you must not forget labor. Forgetting labor is forgetting one’s roots and not being considered a laboring person. Our Dazhai has no cadres who do not labor, and not laboring means not being a good cadre.

Chen Yonggui thought and acted. No matter how busy he was with work, he insisted on finding time to participate in labor. Sometimes, when going out for meetings or work, he would return to Dazhai to participate in labor for a few days during the rest time in between. Going to the county city for a meeting, he rarely stayed overnight in the county organ. Sometimes, he was still working in the fields until dusk, and after dinner, he went to the city for a meeting and returned late at night. The next morning, he went to work in the fields again. In Dazhai, he usually used the early morning, evening, and midday rest time to handle work and cherished labor time.

On October 3 last year, Chen Yonggui accompanied foreign guests to visit Dazhai. After seeing off the foreign guests, the sun had already set, and the commune members were about to finish work. A comrade from the county saw that Chen Yonggui was already very tired and said: “Old Chen! You should go back and rest!” Chen Yonggui said: “No! I still have work to do.” After saying that, he turned around and went down to the field to peel corn. He worked for another hour and returned to the village only after it got dark.

On a day in early April this year, the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee notified him to go to Taiyuan for a meeting, and the time was very tight. However, after having breakfast, he still went to the Quanshuiwa project site with the commune members, discussed work with the cadres, labored with the commune members, and during the rest time, sang “The East Is Red” with the commune members, together wishing Chairman Mao a long life! Together, they opened the red “Quotations from Chairman Mao” to study the highest instructions, and he also talked to the commune members about the current good situation, the new trends in class struggle, reminded the cadres and commune members to firmly remember Chairman Mao’s teaching of “never forgetting class struggle,” and actively attack the class enemies. He encouraged everyone to actively seize the revolution and promote production, win the first battle of spring plowing and sowing, and strive for a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. After saying that, he immediately went to Taiyuan for the meeting. Chen Yonggui said: “Squeezing time to labor more will increase the strength to prevent laziness; participating in collective production labor more will add a red heart to serve the people; sweating with the commune members more in labor will add proletarian revolutionary feelings. In this way, over a long period, a wall to prevent revisionism can be built, blocking the gap of detaching from labor and detaching from the masses, and maintaining Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line.”

Work busy, but the style of connecting with the masses does not change

Chen Yonggui holds multiple positions and his work is very busy. Since the proletarian cultural revolution, more than 170,000 people from all over the country have visited Dazhai, and more than 3,000 foreign guests from over 80 countries have visited Dazhai. Meeting with visiting representatives and receiving foreign guests all take up a lot of his time; especially after he assumed the leadership of the province and county, some comrades from the province, prefecture, and county also need to discuss work with him, and he also needs to attend many important meetings.

In such a busy work situation, how to get rid of being entangled in trivial matters and go deep into the masses and connect with the masses? Chen Yonggui often thinks in his heart: why were we able to defeat Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits with small rice and guns in the past? It was because we followed Chairman Mao above and relied on the revolutionary masses below. In the proletarian cultural revolution, why were we able to overthrow Liu Shaoqi and expose the traitors, spies, and capitulators who had infiltrated the Party? It was still because we followed the great commander Chairman Mao above and relied on tens of millions of revolutionary masses below. In the future, to hold power well and use power well, we must still follow Chairman Mao above and rely on the revolutionary masses below.

Last year, after the February seizure of power in Xiyang County, there were many things to do in the county-level organs. However, Chen Yonggui, except for participating in some major meetings, did not sit in the office at all.

From late February to early April, in the more than 40 days, Chen Yonggui and the county organ cadres, carrying the “Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and All Levels of Cadres in Rural People’s Communes Across the Country,” went through all 20 communes in the county, investigating and studying while propagating the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, helping more than 200 brigade cadres to stand out, establishing the leading cadre groups of all 415 brigades in the county, having someone to manage revolution and production, having someone to grasp the learn-from-Dazhai movement, and after a year of hard struggle, Xiyang County increased grain production by more than 40% in 1967.

Chen Yonggui goes out to work, always paying attention to connecting with the masses, and when he returns to Dazhai, he is even more heart-to-heart with the commune members, caring for the commune members more than caring for himself.

Once, Chen Yonggui returned from outside and, carrying a bowl, went to the home of the poor peasant old woman Song Mianni to chat and found out that the old woman had difficulty digesting hard food due to illness. He remembered this. A few days later, he brought 30 pounds of beans to the old woman’s family, letting them grind the beans into bean flour and make soft noodles for the old woman to eat. The old woman excitedly said: “Yonggui, Yonggui! You manage such big things, but you still care about my small matters.”

Last autumn, during the “Five Grains” harvest, Chen Yonggui took the kindergarten teachers and 20-30 children to the fields and threshing grounds to pick up lost grains. At the beginning, people did not understand the significance of his doing this. Chen Yonggui said: “These children should be instilled with the concept of labor from a young age. Picking up a few grains is a small matter, but picking up the character of laboring people and the spiritual atom bomb of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism is a big matter.” He also said: “To make a revolution, it is not enough to manage just one generation; to manage generation after generation without degeneration is to be a thorough revolutionary.”

Honor elevated, but the quality of modesty and prudence does not change

After Chen Yonggui assumed the leadership of the province and county, the Party and the people gave him many honors, and the masses trusted him more and more, and he heard more and more praise.

In this situation, Chen Yonggui often thinks about the problem of “to whom does the honor belong” and stands guard in his mind, not letting even a little “I” in. He often says: “All the achievements of Dazhai belong to Chairman Mao, belong to the Communist Party, belong to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, belong to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, belong to the people, and belong to the collective. My own growth is all thanks to the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought.”

Every time Chen Yonggui goes to the city for a meeting, he thinks of the poor and lower-middle peasants in terms of eating, living, and traveling. For example, every time he goes out for a meeting, he orders the cheapest food in the hotel. Sometimes when he has a minor illness, he usually does not say anything, fearing to spend the country’s medical expenses. He thinks: in the past, the capitalist-roaders took medicine without illness, and when they had a minor illness, they did not go to work for a year and a half, but their salaries were not reduced at all; now, we cannot walk the old road of the capitalist-roaders. Chen Yonggui is very tired physically, and the commune hospital said to give him some tonic medicine, but he firmly refused, saying: “Eating coarse rice and participating in labor can cure all diseases.”

Chen Yonggui also has a story of dismissing a bodyguard. Last July, the province sent a soldier named Xiao Liu from the People’s Liberation Army to be Chen Yonggui’s bodyguard. Chen Yonggui did not agree to have one. However, later Xiao Liu insisted on coming. Since Xiao Liu came, Chen Yonggui’s mind has been burdened, thinking: Chairman Mao said, “All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people,” how can this servant of the people have a bodyguard! The servant of the people is to serve the people, and as soon as he goes out, a bodyguard follows behind, and how many masses will distance themselves from me. Therefore, he persuaded Xiao Liu to go back every day.

“Xiao Liu, go back to your unit, there is more work there that needs you, I don’t need you here!”

“Old Chen, this is a task assigned by the superior, can I leave without completing the task?”

“Xiao Liu, what kind of person do you think I am, I am a farmer, assigning a bodyguard to me, can you assign one to each of the 500 million farmers in the country?”

Chen Yonggui’s words made Xiao Liu speechless. However, Xiao Liu still did not leave. When going out for a meeting, Xiao Liu wanted to carry Chen Yonggui’s briefcase, but Chen Yonggui firmly refused, saying: “In the past, when going to the city for a meeting, I still carried my own luggage; now, the position has changed, and even the briefcase is carried by others, how can this be!” When staying in the organ, Xiao Liu wanted to draw water and sweep the floor for Chen Yonggui in the early morning, but Chen Yonggui had already gotten up, washed his face, swept the floor, and sat there seriously reading the newspaper and studying Chairman Mao’s works. In this way, Xiao Liu often had nothing to do, and Chen Yonggui continued to do ideological work on Xiao Liu and persuaded him to go back. When Xiao Liu left, Chen Yonggui gave him a set of shining gold “Quotations from Chairman Mao.”

Chen Yonggui thus strictly requires himself, firmly holds the frugal and hardworking style from the small matters of life, prevents the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and always remains an ordinary person.

    不是要做官  而是要革命
    ——记陈永贵同志担任山西省革命委员会副主任后的事迹
    “我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵同志，担任了山西省革命委员会副主任、昔阳县革命委员会主任。
    陈永贵同志，地位变了，职务变了，但他千变万变，忠于毛主席的一颗红心没有变，坚持参加集体生产劳动的好作风没有变，密切联系群众的好作风没有变，艰苦朴素的好作风没有变。
    他手里的犁把、锄把没有丢，手上一层层的厚茧子没有退，工作怎么忙也要挤时间和社员一块下田劳动，有时外出开会临走的前一、两个小时还在地里劳动，有时从北京、太原开会回到大寨，跳下车就下田干活。
    他还和大寨社员一样地生活，经常端着碗到饭场和社员蹲在一起吃饭，坐在炕头和社员一块谈心，坐在地头和社员一块学习毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想学习班里和社员一起斗私批修。
    他头上仍然裹着一块白毛巾，身上穿着半旧的布衫，脚上穿着家庭自做的鞋，社员身上有多少泥，他身上也有多少泥。
    大寨的贫下中农说：“永贵当了官不象官，还是咱庄稼人的老样子。”
    地位变了，劳动人民的本色不变
    陈永贵同志被选为山西省革命委员会副主任、昔阳县革命委员会主任以后，既高兴，又担心。他头脑里开始闪出了“怕”字。
    陈永贵同志是个无私无畏的人，他怕什么呢？
    陈永贵同志在想，十多年来，大寨党支部紧跟毛主席指引的道路，坚持社会主义方向，坚持搞集体生产，自力更生建设新大寨，使大寨发生了巨大的变化。大寨千变万变，干部的劳动人民本色没有变，干部参加集体生产劳动的制度没有变，参加生产、领导生产的作风没有变。正因为这样，大寨大队的领导班子有着很好的群众基础，成为广大群众的革命化的领导核心。在农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，大寨大队的领导班子团结贫下中农和革命群众，坚定地跟着毛主席，沿着他老人家指出的革命航道胜利前进。
    陈永贵同志在想，权从那里夺来的？走资派是为什么被打倒的？在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，被我们揪出来的旧山西省委、旧晋中地委和旧昔阳县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，有些原来就是隐藏在党内的坏人，有些人则是在全国解放以后变坏了的。我们无产阶级革命派掌的大权，就是从这些人手里夺过来的。他回想得很远，在过去抗日战争和解放战争年代里，我们党的许许多多的领导干部，天天同革命群众生活在一起，劳动在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。大家患难与共，亲密无间，建立了鱼水关系。这是我们在艰苦的条件下，打败敌人，取得抗日战争和解放战争胜利的一个重要保证。全国解放以后，一些同志的地位，以及领导机关的工作环境和物质条件发生了很大的变化。在这种新的情况下，多数领导同志忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，经得起考验，保持了无产阶级革命者的本色。但是，也有那么一小部分人，开始高高在上，做官当老爷，思想感情和阶级立场发生了变化。他们长期脱离生产劳动，同时也就脱离了群众，由鱼水关系变成油水关系，失去了群众的信任。群众有问题不愿意向他们反映，心里有话不对他们讲。群众的聪明才智，他们看不见，学不到。他们遇事拿不定主意，找不出解决的办法。这样，他们实际上老早就失去了对于群众的领导权。他们脱离了群众，而又要继续在领导岗位上发号施令，那就要实行错误的领导。你让他领导日常工作，他就会说空话，放空炮。你让他指挥生产，他就会瞎指挥，给群众的生产和生活带来损失，甚至会把社会主义的生产建设引向资本主义复辟的邪路。你让他领导群众运动，他就会对广大无产阶级革命派实行资产阶级专政。这样演变下去，越变越修，他们就不但不是党的“从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去”的桥梁，反而是党联系群众的绊脚石。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们夺了走资派的权，革了走资派的命，就是因为他们脱离劳动，脱离群众，脱离艰苦生活，变成修正主义分子了。而我们从走资派手里夺了权，如果不革自己的命，忘了劳动，忘了群众，忘了艰苦生活，也会走走资派的老路！人变修了，党就会变质，国家就会变色，无产阶级的政权就会丢失！他想到这些，所以思想上产生了“四怕”：怕脱离群众，怕特殊化，怕浪费，怕参加劳动少。
    他在这种“怕”字思想指导下，在开始担任省革委会副主任和昔阳县革委会主任的时候，就向上级领导同志提出了自己的要求：工作要做，但必须想尽一切办法保证我能经常参加集体生产劳动，密切联系群众，使我永远保持劳动人民的本色，永不变质。
    职务高了，坚持参加集体劳动不变
    陈永贵同志认为，职务高了，架子不能大，要同社员一样，经常参加劳动。人变质，往往从懒字开始，不参加劳动正是变懒的开始，变修的缺口。不参加劳动，就不能联系群众，不能改造自己。
    因此，陈永贵同志离开大寨，出外办公、开会的时候，常常翻开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一字一句地念：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”
    他头脑里想着：自己是劳动人民出身，是苦水里泡大的人；在旧社会，全家房无一间，地无一垄，吃的是糠菜饭，穿的是破布衣。母亲、姐姐和弟弟被迫卖给人家逃活命，父亲给地主扛长工，年老被地主一脚踢出门，含着悲愤的泪花吊死在祖坟里的树下。自己八岁就开始给地主扛长工，受尽了比黄连还苦的苦。地主富农看穷人不如一根草，是毛主席他老人家救了我，给我指明了一条翻身求解放的路；是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育了我，使我从一个只懂得为个人翻身闹革命的普通农民，成长为一个共产党员。没有伟大领袖毛主席，就没有我陈永贵，毛主席他老人家的恩情，比天高，比海深。
    陈永贵同志读着毛主席的谆谆教导，想着自己苦难的家史，暗暗警告自己：永贵啊，永贵！你是劳动人出身，可不能忘了劳动。忘了劳动，就是忘了本，就算不上是劳动人民。咱大寨没有不劳动的干部，不劳动就当不好干部。
    陈永贵同志想到，做到，他工作再忙，也要坚持挤时间参加劳动。有时外出开会、办公，中间有几天休息时间，他也要回到大寨参加几天劳动，不在城市闲逛。到县城开会，很少在县机关住夜，有时傍黑还在地里劳动，晚饭后到城里开会，开罢会深夜回来，第二天一早又下地劳动。在大寨，他一般都是利用一早、一晚和中午休息时间处理工作，十分珍惜劳动时间。
    去年十月三日，陈永贵同志陪同外宾参观大寨，送别外宾时，已经太阳落山，社员快要收工了。县里的一个同志见陈永贵已经很累了，就说：“老陈！你该回去休息休息了！”陈永贵同志说：“不！我还有事。”说罢，扭头就下地剥玉茭去了。他又劳动了一个小时，天黑才回村。
    今年四月上旬的一天，山西省革命委员会通知他到太原开会，时间很紧。可是他在吃罢早饭以后，还和社员一块到泉水洼工地，同干部一起研究工作，同社员一起劳动，在休息时，和社员一起高唱《东方红》，共同敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！共同打开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》学习最高指示，还给社员讲了当前的大好形势，讲了当前阶级斗争的新动向，提醒干部社员牢牢记住毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，主动向阶级敌人进攻，鼓励大家积极抓革命，促生产，打胜春耕播种第一仗，为无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利争光。说罢，他就马上到太原开会去了。陈永贵同志说：“挤时间多劳动，就会增加防止懒的力量；多参加一次集体生产劳动，就能多一分为人民服务的红心；多和社员一起在劳动中流一身汗水，就多一分无产阶级的革命感情。这样，天长日久，就能筑起一堵防修城墙，堵住脱离劳动、脱离群众的缺口，保住毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。”
    工作忙了，联系群众的作风不变
    陈永贵同志身兼数职，工作十分繁忙。自从无产阶级文化大革命以来，全国各地先后有一百七十多万人到大寨参观，全世界有八十多个国家的三千多名外宾到大寨参观访问。会见参观的代表，接待外宾，都要占去他不少时间；特别是他担任省、县领导工作以后，省、专、县一些同志也要找他研究工作，他还要出席许多重要会议。
    在这样千头万绪的工作情况下，如何摆脱繁琐事务缠身，深入群众，联系群众呢？陈永贵心里时常想：过去，我们为什么能够靠小米加步枪，打败日本帝国主义和国民党匪帮？就是上跟毛主席，下靠革命群众。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们为什么能够打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，揪出钻进党内的叛徒、特务、自首变节分子？还是上跟伟大统帅毛主席，下靠千百万革命群众。今后掌好权、用好权，更要上跟毛主席，下靠革命群众。
    去年，昔阳县“二月”夺权胜利以后，县级机关有许多事要做。可是，陈永贵同志除参加一些重大的会议外，根本没有在办公室坐。
    从二月下旬到四月初的四十多天时间里，陈永贵和县里的机关干部，带着《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，走遍了全县二十个公社，一面调查研究，一面宣传毛主席和党中央的指示，帮助二百多个大队干部站出来，使全县四百一十五个大队的领导班子建立起来，革命、生产有人管，学大寨运动有人抓，经过一年的艰苦奋斗，昔阳全县一九六七年的粮食增产四成多。
    陈永贵同志出去工作，时时注意联系群众，回到大寨更是和社员心贴心，关心社员胜过关心自己。
    有一次，陈永贵同志从外边回来，吃饭的时候，端着碗到贫农老太太宋免妮家里说家常，了解到老太太有病吃硬饭不好消化，他把这事记在心里。几天以后，他给老太太换来三十斤小豆，让她家里人给老太太磨成豆面，做软软的面条吃。这位老太太激动地说：“永贵呀，永贵！你管那么大的事，还把我告你的小事情操上心。”
    去年秋天，“五谷”登场的时候，陈永贵同志带着幼儿园的教师和二、三十个娃娃到地里、场边拣丢失的粮食。开始，人们不理解他这样做的意义。陈永贵同志说：“这些娃娃们，从小就要培养他们的劳动观念，拾几粒粮食是小事，但拾起劳动人民的本色，拾起反修防修的精神原子弹是大事。”他又说：“搞革命，光管自己一辈子，不算彻底革命派；要管辈辈不变质，才算彻底的革命派。”
    荣誉高了，谦虚谨慎的品质不变
    陈永贵同志担任了省、县的领导以后，党和人民给了他很多荣誉，群众对他也非常信任，他耳边听到赞扬声越来越多。
    在这种情况下，陈永贵同志经常想到在“荣誉究竟归于谁”这个问题上要站好头脑里的岗，不让一点“我”字钻进去。他常说：“大寨的一切成绩，都归功于毛主席，归功于共产党，归功于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，归功于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，归功于人民群众，归功于集体。我自己的成长，全靠伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育。”
    陈永贵同志每次进城开会，吃、住、行，事事想到贫下中农，和贫下中农的生活对照。比如，每当出外开会，他住在宾馆，就订吃那价格最低的饭菜。有时身体有点小病，他一般不作声，怕花国家的医疗费，他想：过去走资派没病乱吃药，有了小病一年半载不上班，工资一点不少要；现在，我们不能走走资派的老路。陈永贵同志身体劳累得很，公社医院说给他吃些补养药，他坚决不要，他说：“吃小米，参加劳动，能治百病。”
    陈永贵同志还有个退警卫员的故事。去年七月，省里派了一个叫小刘的解放军战士，给陈永贵当警卫员。陈永贵同志就不同意要。可是，后来小刘硬来了。自打小刘一来，陈永贵的思想就增加了负担，他想：毛主席说，“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”，我这勤务员添了警卫员怎能行呀！勤务员是为人民服务，一出门后边跟上一个警卫员，不知有多少群众就会离自己远了。因此，他天天动员小刘回去。
    “小刘，你回部队去，那里有更需要你的工作去干，我这里不需要你呀！”
    “老陈，这是首长交给我的任务，我没有完成任务能随意离开吗？”
    “小刘，你把我当成什么样人了，我是一个农民，派一个警卫员，全国五亿农民，你一人派一个能行吗？”
    陈永贵的话把小刘说住了。可是，小刘还是不走。出外开会时，小刘要给陈永贵提文件包，陈永贵坚决不用，他说：“过去进城开会，还自背行李；现在，地位变了，连文件包也让别人提，这怎行！”住在机关，清早小刘要给陈永贵打水、扫地，可总是小刘一去，陈永贵早已起床洗了脸，扫了地，坐在那里认真地看报，学习毛主席著作。这样，小刘常常找不到事干，陈永贵同志还是继续给小刘做思想工作，硬把小刘说服回去了。小刘临走时，陈永贵同志送给他一套金光闪闪的毛主席宝书。
    陈永贵同志就这样严格地要求自己，硬是从生活小事上把住艰苦朴素的口子，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，永远当个老百姓。
