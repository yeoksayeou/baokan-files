The Revolutionary Committee of the First Automobile Works in Changchun, with the help of the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao. In the midst of the struggle, criticism, and reform, it has focused on weak links, significantly accelerating the pace of the struggle, criticism, and reform. The revolution is vigorous and practical, and production has surged.

Since the establishment of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, it has followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao. On the basis of thoroughly carrying out revolutionary criticism and firmly grasping the struggle against the enemy, it has seriously implemented the policy of streamlining administration, vigorously reforming unreasonable regulations and institutions, and eliminating outdated ideas that do not conform to the socialist economic base. It has transferred office staff to the production front lines. However, some sub-factories have not fully understood the great significance of the struggle, criticism, and reform, and the movement has progressed slowly. Initially, some comrades in the factory's Revolutionary Committee did not pay enough attention to these few weak units, did not grasp them tightly, and thought that the revolution and production in most units of the factory were going well, and that one or two units being slightly behind was not a big deal. The PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the comrades of the factory's Revolutionary Committee studied together Chairman Mao's teachings on "We now manage many aspects, and the work of various places, armies, and departments must all be taken into account. We cannot focus on one part while neglecting the others." Everyone realized that the entire factory is a whole, and if one unit's struggle, criticism, and reform are not done well, it will affect the entire factory. They also realized that the more a unit's struggle, criticism, and reform are lagging, the more complex the class struggle is. Only by occupying those positions with Mao Zedong Thought can the backward situation there be changed.

After raising their awareness, the members of the Revolutionary Committee went deep into the grassroots level and focused on weak links. Members of the factory's Revolutionary Committee went to the only sub-factory in the entire factory that had not established a Revolutionary Committee to conduct investigations and research. They discovered that a small handful of class enemies were secretly sabotaging, inciting bourgeois factionalism, and vigorously advocating the reactionary "multi-center theory," preventing the revolutionary great alliance from being consolidated and the revolutionary three-in-one combination from being realized. Therefore, the factory's Revolutionary Committee helped them set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Never forget class struggle," and fiercely criticized the reactionary "multi-center theory." The chairman of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, Yu Hairong, personally went to this factory to do detailed ideological and political work, mobilized the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism, quickly exposed the small handful of class enemies who were sabotaging the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and swiftly established a Revolutionary Committee, making the entire factory red.

In the struggle, criticism, and reform, the factory's Revolutionary Committee focused on weak links, mainly by arming the revolutionary workers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought and transforming the backward situation of those backward units. The foundry division's sand core workshop is a key workshop in the entire factory. However, this workshop's revolution and production have always been in a backward state, not only affecting the factory's revolution and production but also seriously affecting the entire factory. The deputy chairman of the general factory's Revolutionary Committee, Liu Shouhua, and the military representative, Cheng Bin, personally went to this workshop, worked with the workers, and conducted investigations and research on the reasons why the revolution and production were not going well. They discovered that a bad element was spreading "anarchism" and the fallacious theory of "struggle, criticize, and disperse," viciously attacking the struggle, criticism, and reform as "struggle, criticize, and persecute." Initially, some workers did not clearly recognize his true face. The comrades of the general factory's Revolutionary Committee and the workers studied together Chairman Mao's teachings on "The working class is the leading class," fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle," and thoroughly exposed the reasons why the revolution and production were not progressing. The more they studied, the more the revolutionary workers felt their responsibility was heavy; the more they criticized, the more they hated the small handful of class enemies; the more they exposed, the clearer the reasons for the problems became. They quickly exposed the bad element hidden in the revolutionary ranks, rapidly promoted the struggle, criticism, and reform, and the production situation improved dramatically. Sand core production increased by more than one hundred percent compared to before.

The new and old cadres of various levels of Revolutionary Committees in the automobile factory, under the leadership of the general factory's Revolutionary Committee, all went deep into the workshops and teams, focused on the weak links of the struggle, criticism, and reform, and studied, revolutionized, lived, and worked with the workers to solve old and difficult problems together. The forging division's heat treatment equipment has always been outdated, the workers' labor intensity is high, and the production efficiency is low. In the past, the walking capitalists and reactionary technical "authorities" obstructed the workers' innovations. The members of the Revolutionary Committee went deep into the workshop, studied with the workers Chairman Mao's teachings on "The working class is the leading class," and deeply criticized China's Khrushchev's "creeping philosophy" and the worship of foreign things. Old workers and revolutionary technical personnel formed a "three-in-one combination" technical innovation team, designed and installed the equipment themselves, and worked day and night for 100 hours to successfully build a flame jet large workpiece heat treatment vibration furnace. This effectively reduced the workers' labor intensity and greatly improved work efficiency. From National Day to now, in just eight or nine days, the new and old cadres of various levels of Revolutionary Committees, while working with the workers, have innovated and solved more than 30 technical and old and difficult problems.

The Revolutionary Committee of the automobile factory focused on the weak links in the struggle, criticism, and reform, and the mass movement of struggle, criticism, and reform at the grassroots level has taken on a new situation. It has greatly suppressed the arrogance of a small handful of class enemies and greatly boosted the morale of the working class. The high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform has powerfully promoted the great development of production. Automobile production has surged. Following the 55% increase in production in September compared to August and the completion of the state's production task four days ahead of schedule, the daily production in the first ten days of October has increased by 8% compared to the average daily production in September.

    长春第一汽车制造厂革委会在解放军帮助下
    深入基层狠抓薄弱环节  加速各部门斗批改的步伐
    斗批改推动了生产大发展，全厂汽车生产大幅度增长，九月份提前超额完成国家生产计划，十月上旬生产继续上升
    本报讯　长春第一汽车制造厂革委会，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在斗、批、改的高潮中，狠抓薄弱环节，大大加速了斗、批、改的步伐，革命轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实，生产大幅度上升。
    厂革委会成立以后，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在深入开展革命大批判、狠抓对敌斗争的基础上，认真实行精兵简政，大力改革不合理的规章制度和破除不适应社会主义经济基础的旧观念，下放科室人员，充实生产第一线。但是，也有个别分厂对斗、批、改的伟大意义认识不足，运动进展缓慢。在厂革委会中，开始有的同志对这些少数薄弱单位不够重视，抓得不紧，认为全厂绝大多数单位革命、生产都搞得很好，一两个单位差一点无关大局。驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和厂革委会的同志们一起学习了毛主席关于“我们现在管的方面很多，各地、各军、各部门的工作，都要照顾到，不能只注意一部分问题而把别的丢掉”的教导，大家认识到，全厂是一个整体，一个单位的斗、批、改搞不好，就会影响全厂。他们还认识到，越是斗、批、改搞得差的单位，阶级斗争越复杂，只有用毛泽东思想去占领那些阵地，才能改变那里的落后面貌。
    认识提高后，革委会人员纷纷深入基层，狠抓薄弱环节。厂革委会成员深入到全厂唯一的一个没有成立革委会的分厂，进行调查研究，发现一小撮阶级敌人在背后进行破坏，煽动资产阶级派性，极力鼓吹反动的“多中心论”，使这个厂的革命大联合不能巩固，革命的三结合迟迟不能实现。于是，厂革委会就帮助他们办起了毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠批反动的“多中心论”。厂革委会主任于海荣同志，亲自深入到这个厂做细致的思想政治工作，发动群众开展革命大批判，把破坏革命三结合的一小撮阶级敌人很快地揪了出来，迅速成立了革委会，全厂实现了一片红。
    厂革委会在斗、批、改中，狠抓薄弱环节，最主要的是用毛泽东思想去武装革命职工的头脑，改造那些后进单位的落后面貌。铸造分厂砂芯车间，是全厂的关键车间。可是这个车间的革命和生产一直处于落后状态，不仅影响了本厂的革命和生产，而且也严重地影响了全厂。总厂革委会副主任刘守华和军队代表程斌同志，就亲自深入到这个车间，和工人一起劳动，一起调查研究革命和生产搞不好的原因，发现是一个坏人在搞“无政府主义”，散布“斗、批、散”的谬论，恶毒地攻击斗、批、改是“斗、批、整”。开始，有的工人对他的面目认识不清，总厂革委会的同志就和工人一起，大学毛主席关于“工人阶级是领导阶级”的教导，大批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大摆革命、生产上不去的原因。越学，革命工人感到自己的责任越重大；越批，对一小撮阶级敌人越恨；越摆，问题的原因越明，很快就把那个隐藏在革命队伍的坏人揪了出来，使斗、批、改迅速开展起来，生产面貌焕然一新，砂芯生产比原来增长一倍以上。
    汽车厂各级革委会的新老干部，在总厂革委会的带动下，都纷纷深入车间、班组，狠抓斗、批、改的薄弱环节，和工人同学习，同革命，同生活，同劳动，一起解决老大难问题。锻造分厂热处理设备一直很陈旧，工人劳动强度大，生产效率低，过去走资派和反动技术“权威”阻挠工人革新。革委会人员深入车间，和工人一起学习毛主席“工人阶级是领导阶级”的教导，深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“爬行哲学”和崇洋思想。老工人和革命的技术人员组成“三结合”的技术革新小组，自己设计，自己安装，昼夜连续奋战一百小时，成功地建成了火焰喷射大工件热处理振动炉，有效地减轻了工人的劳动强度，大大提高了工作效率。从国庆节到现在，仅八、九天的时间，各级革委会的新老干部，在和工人一起劳动中，就革新和解决了三十多项技术和老大难问题。
    汽车厂革委会狠抓了斗、批、改中的薄弱环节，各基层单位斗、批、改的群众运动出现了新局面，大灭了一小撮阶级敌人的威风，大长了工人阶级的志气。斗、批、改的高潮有力地推动了生产的大发展，汽车生产大幅度增长，继九月份产量比八月份增长百分之五十五，提前四天超额完成国家交给的生产任务之后，十月上旬的日产量又比九月份平均日产量提高百分之八。
