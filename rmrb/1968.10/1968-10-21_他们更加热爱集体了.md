	They Have Become Even More Devoted to the Collective

	Not long ago, in a production brigade of Ertai People's Commune in Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, the horses were often sent on long trips to pull heavy loads, which resulted in significant physical exertion. To ensure the horses were well-fed and healthy, they needed to be released to graze at night. However, it was the busy autumn season, and it was difficult to find people to do this. Just as the brigade was struggling with this issue, five sent-down educated youth volunteered to take on the task of nighttime grazing. The brigade and the poor and lower-middle peasants praised their selfless actions for the collective.

	After grazing for just two nights, a malicious rumor spread in the village: "These five 'outsiders' are grazing at night because they see this year's harvest and want to find ways to work more, so they can get more grain and money after autumn!" These words reached the ears of the five young people, and they were infuriated. Some even thought about quitting: "During the day, we work as usual, and at night, we graze the horses for the brigade. We work so hard for the collective, and yet there are people spreading such rumors. We might as well not do it!"

	When the group leader, Xie Peixin, heard the rumors and saw his comrades' reactions, he immediately became alert and reported the situation to the brigade leader. Together, they conducted an investigation and discovered that the rumors were spread by a historical counter-revolutionary who had been criticized by the masses just a few days earlier.

	That evening, before grazing, Xie Peixin organized a study session titled "Never Forget Class Struggle." They first studied Chairman Mao's teachings on how "imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat and will make their last struggles." Then, he explained the situation in detail. He said, "The better our production, the more solid our collective economy, the more the class enemies will be afraid and try to sabotage it in every way. Now, we have only grazed the horses for two nights and done a little good for the collective, and the enemy is already spreading rumors about us. If we relax our class consciousness, the enemy will take advantage. We must not fall for it!"

	After Xie Peixin's words, everyone's minds became clear. Some said, "The class enemy is everywhere. They think we have been here for a short time and have weak class struggle awareness, so they try to trick us to achieve their goal of sabotaging production. This is like dreaming during the day!" Others said, "We graze the horses at night out of devotion to the public. The more the class enemy tries to sabotage our nighttime grazing, the more determined we must be to continue." The young person who was initially angry and wanted to quit said excitedly, "When I first heard those bad words, I was so angry that I forgot to use the method of class analysis to deal with them, and I almost fell for the class enemy's trap!"

	After the study session on Mao Zedong Thought ended, the five young people, under the moonlight, led the brigade's horses happily towards the grasslands. Through this study, they raised their awareness and became even more devoted to the collective.

    他们更加热爱集体了
    前些日子，河北张北县二台公社一个生产队的马总是出远门，拉重货，体力消耗很大。要使马膘肥体壮，就得坚持夜间放青。可眼下正是秋忙季节，很难抽出人来。正当队里为这事作难的时候，五个下乡知识青年，主动承担了夜间放青的任务。队上和贫下中农对他们这种一心为集体的行动非常赞扬。
    刚放了两夜，村里却刮起了一股阴风，说什么“五个‘外来户’夜间放青就是看着今年丰收了，变着法儿多出工，好等秋后多分粮，多拿钱！”这话传进了五个小青年的耳朵里，可把他们惹火了，有的就产生了撂挑子思想：白天咱们照常出工，夜间给队里放马，为集体这样辛苦，想不到还有人说这种怪话，咱干脆不干了！小组长解培新听到流言蜚语和看到同伴们的表现，立刻引起警觉，马上向队长反映了这一情况。他跟队长一块进行了调查研究，发现原来是前几天那个被群众批斗了的历史反革命分子散布的流言蜚语。
    当天晚上放马前，解培新就组织大家办起了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”学习班。首先学习了毛主席关于“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎”的教导，接着便把事情原原本本地告诉了大家。他说：“咱们生产搞得越好，集体经济越巩固，阶级敌人越是害怕，也就越要想方设法搞破坏。如今我们刚给队里放了两夜马，做了点对集体有利的事，敌人就到处造我们的谣。阶级观念松一松，敌人就会攻一攻，我们可不要上当啊！”
    小组长解培新这么一说，大家心里就豁然开朗了。有的说：“阶级敌人真是无孔不入，他们认为我们来的时间短，阶级斗争观念淡漠，就在我们身上打鬼主意，想达到他破坏生产的目的，这真是白天做梦！”有的说：“我们夜间放马，是一心为公。阶级敌人越是破坏我们夜间放马，我们越要坚定地放下去。”那个一气之下就想撂挑子的小青年，这时激动地说：“我乍一听到那些坏话，就气得火冒三丈，忘记了用阶级分析的方法对待这些话，险些上了阶级敌人的当！”
    这次举办的毛泽东思想学习班结束了，五个小青年乘着月色又牵着队里的马，高高兴兴地向草滩走去。经过这次学习，他们提高了觉悟，更加热爱集体了。　赵元翔
