The seas and rivers surge with waves of anger, and the five continents shake with thunderous excitement. Under the auspices of a red China, as we celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we joyously hail the birth of the color documentary film _Piano Accompaniment to "The Red Lantern."_

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people, for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and should be created for and used by them." Proletarian literature and art must "sing the praises of the proletariat and the working people." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, _Piano Accompaniment to "The Red Lantern"_ starts from the lofty goal of sculpting heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving them. It critically absorbs the useful parts of piano art and revolutionizes it. _Piano Accompaniment to "The Red Lantern"_ perfectly combines the wide range, majestic momentum, rich colors, and strong expressiveness of the piano with the upright, bright, and dramatic characteristics of Peking opera music, enriching and recreating the eight arias of Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei. In piano performance, it makes many new attempts in expressive techniques and performance skills according to the needs of revolutionary political content, thus fundamentally changing the piano art from political content to artistic expression.

In the important aria "Hatred Grows in My Heart," when Tie Mei forcefully tosses her braid and clenches her fists, filled with deep hatred for the class enemy, she sings the line "The enemy's heart explodes with rage" in a powerful and soaring voice. The piano, following the sharp rhythm of the gongs and drums, strongly plays a few chords and uses the expressive scraping technique, creating a momentum like a surging wave, fully expressing Tie Mei's intense class hatred and national resentment. Finally, when Tie Mei sings "Tie Mei, I am prepared: I am not afraid of being caught, not afraid of being released, not afraid of being whipped, not afraid of being imprisoned! Even if my body is crushed, I will not reveal the secret code," the piano, with solid and full sounds and powerful rhythms, expresses Tie Mei's firm revolutionary will, perfectly sculpting the heroic image of Li Tie Mei, a mature proletarian revolutionary successor.

In the aria "Ambition Soars to the Sky," the piano performance uses the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. From the beginning of the prelude, the piano plays firm and bright chords in the high register, depicting the heroic image of Li Yuhe, a worker. In the low register, it plays steady chords, from light to heavy, with the mood rising step by step, powerfully portraying Li Yuhe's heroic demeanor as he strides to the execution ground, fearless and full of ambition. When Li Yuhe sings "My ambition soars to the sky," the piano plays a swift and bright melody, with the momentum of a mountain pressing down, vividly expressing Li Yuhe's ambition to "overcome all enemies and never be subdued by them." When singing "To the execution ground, head held high, looking far ahead," the piano uses revolutionary romanticism to lightly play a bright and radiant melody symbolizing the revolutionary red lantern. The sound quickly expands from clear and bright to passionate and heroic. After the piano's creative performance, Li Yuhe's revolutionary passion and the magnificent scene of the revolutionary torrent surging high are vividly depicted. When singing "At that time, all over China, red flags are flying," the piano plays a melody like rolling thunder, depicting a magnificent scene of red flags as vast as the sea, joyous crowds, and a new China rising like a brilliant red sun in the East. In the coda, the piano creatively responds to the prelude, playing surging and tumultuous sounds, and once again plays the firm and bright theme of Li Yuhe, making the heroic image of Li Yuhe, a Communist Party member who treats the execution ground as a battlefield, standing tall and proud before us.

After watching the film, our hearts surged with emotion, and our blood boiled. The two towering and radiant heroic images of Li Yuhe and Li Tie Mei strongly inspire us, making our hearts unable to calm down for a long time.

The piano is an instrument created by the laboring people with their own hands. In the past, this instrument, known as the "jewel of music," was monopolized and controlled by the bourgeoisie. Those sonatas, fantasies, concertos, and minuets were nothing but the howls of gods and ghosts, nothing but the moans of the masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies. In the 20th century, with the decline of the entire capitalist system, the piano art of the bourgeoisie has become even more pathetic. What with hammers hitting the piano, feet stomping on the keys, and even monkeys becoming famous "piano performers," it is truly shameful to the extreme! Especially infuriating is that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the literary and artistic circles, such as Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and Lin Mo Han, in order to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism, dared to peddle the black goods of fame, foreign, and ancient, and feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist in our great socialist China. This is intolerable!

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, leading the broad masses of revolutionary literary and artistic warriors, has carried forward the fearless spirit of the proletariat to dare to think, dare to do, and dare to revolutionize, liberating piano art from the hands of the bourgeoisie, making piano art flourish and gain new life.

The birth of _Piano Accompaniment to "The Red Lantern"_ eloquently proves that only in our great socialist China, only in our brilliant Mao Zedong era, can piano art have the broadest and brightest future.

The birth of _Piano Accompaniment to "The Red Lantern"_ solemnly declares to the world: the creators of human history—the workers, peasants, and soldiers—will forever be the masters of piano art. The inverted history has been inverted!

    工人阶级的赞歌　“洋为中用”的典范
    ——赞彩色纪录片《钢琴伴唱〈红灯记〉》
    鹰击宇
    四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。在祖国山河一片红的大好形势下，在全国亿万军民欢庆伟大的中华人民共和国成立十九周年的光辉节日里，我们热烈欢呼彩色纪录片《钢琴伴唱〈红灯记〉》的诞生。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”无产阶级文艺必须“歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民”。遵循毛主席的教导，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》从塑造工农兵英雄形象、为工农兵服务这一崇高的目标出发，批判地吸收了钢琴艺术中有用的部分，对钢琴艺术进行了革命的改造。钢琴伴唱《红灯记》把钢琴音域宽广、气势雄伟、色彩丰富、表现力强的特色和京剧音乐挺拔爽朗、高昂激越、富于戏剧性的特点完美地结合在一起，对李玉和与李铁梅的八个唱段给予了再丰富、再创造。在钢琴演奏上，它根据革命政治内容的需要，在表现手法和演奏技术上作了许多新的尝试，从而使钢琴艺术从政治内容到艺术表现都起了根本的变革。
    在“仇恨入心要发芽”这一重要唱段中，当铁梅将辫子用力一甩，双手紧握，满怀着对阶级敌人的血海深仇，唱出了“提起敌寇心肺炸”这一句激昂高亢的唱腔时，钢琴随着铿锵的锣鼓节奏，强烈地奏出几个和弦，又采用了富有表现力的刮键奏法，造成一种排山倒海的气势，把铁梅强烈的阶级仇、民族恨充分表现出来了。最后，当铁梅唱到“铁梅我，有准备：不怕抓，不怕放，不怕皮鞭打，不怕监牢押！粉身碎骨不交密电码”时，钢琴以坚实、饱满的音响和强有力的节奏，表现了铁梅坚强的革命意志，完美地塑造了李铁梅这个已经成熟的无产阶级革命接班人的英雄形象。
    在“雄心壮志冲云天”这一唱段中，钢琴演奏采用了革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法。前奏一开始，钢琴在高音区用坚定、明亮的和弦音响，奏出了工人阶级的英雄形象李玉和的主题；在低音区奏出稳重的和弦音响，由轻到重，情绪步步上升，有力地把李玉和昂首阔步赴刑场、临危不惧雄心壮志的英雄气概烘托出来了。当李玉和唱到“锁不住我雄心壮志冲云天”时，钢琴奏出急骤明快的旋律，以泰山压顶之势，生动地表现了李玉和“要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的凌云壮志。当唱到“赴刑场，气昂昂，抬头远看”时，钢琴运用了革命浪漫主义的表现手法，富有诗意地轻奏出一段明亮、光辉的象征革命红灯的音调，音响由清彻明亮迅速扩展为激昂慷慨。经过钢琴演奏的创造之后，李玉和极目远眺解放区，心中想念红太阳的革命豪情和抗日烽火漫天烧，革命洪流逐浪高的壮丽景象被鲜明地勾划出来了。当唱到“那时候，全中国，红旗插遍”时，钢琴奏出一段好象春雷滚滚、气势磅礴的音响，展现了一幅红旗如海、万众欢腾，新中国象一轮灿烂的红日出现在世界东方的壮丽景象。在尾奏中，钢琴创造性地和前奏相呼应，奏出汹涌澎湃、上下翻腾的音响，并再一次奏出坚定、宏亮的李玉和主题，使一个视刑场为战场，昂首挺胸、勇敢前进的共产党员李玉和的英雄形象巍然屹立在我们的面前。
    看完电影以后，我们心潮澎湃，热血沸腾，李玉和与李铁梅这两个工人阶级的高大而光辉的英雄形象强烈地激励着我们，使我们的心情久久不能平静。
    钢琴是劳动人民用自己劳动的双手创造的乐器。过去，这颗被称为“音乐皇冠上的明珠”，一直被资产阶级垄断和霸占着。那些什么奏鸣曲、幻想曲、协奏曲、小步舞曲之类的钢琴作品，表现的无非是那些神仙鬼怪们的嚎叫，无非是那些老爷、太太、少爷、小姐们的无病呻吟。到了二十世纪的今天，随着整个资本主义制度的没落，资产阶级的钢琴艺术更不象样子了，什么铁锤砸琴，脚踩琴键等等歇斯底里的演奏，甚至连猩猩也成了红极一时的“钢琴演奏家”，真是可耻到了极点！特别令人气愤的是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的代理人周扬、夏衍、林默涵之流，为了达到他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，竟胆敢在我们伟大的社会主义中国大肆贩卖名、洋、古，封、资、修的黑货。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，我们敬爱的江青同志率领广大的革命文艺战士，发扬了敢想、敢干、敢革命的无产阶级大无畏精神，把钢琴艺术从资产阶级的手中解放了出来，使钢琴艺术枯木逢春，获得了新生。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，雄辩地说明了：只有在我们伟大的社会主义中国，只有在我们光辉灿烂的毛泽东时代，钢琴艺术才能有最广阔、最光明的前途。
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，向全世界庄严宣告：人类历史的创造者——工农兵将永远成为钢琴艺术的主人，颠倒的历史被颠倒过来了！
