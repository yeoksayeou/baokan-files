In the factory district of Shenyang City, one often sees a modestly dressed woman riding an old bicycle, rushing to and fro. She is Comrade Wei Fengying, a good worker of Chairman Mao and a deputy director of the Liaoning Revolutionary Committee.

Over the past two years, Comrade Wei Fengying has undergone the baptism of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and has withstood the severe test of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. Together with the broad masses of revolutionary cadres in the Liaoning and Shenyang regions, she has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, braved the winds and waves, and fought against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast China and the Liaoning and Shenyang regions. She has resolutely executed and bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and has made new contributions to the people. In the newly established revolutionary committee, she, with an unyielding red heart for Chairman Mao, has worked to seize power for the proletariat and use it for the proletariat, fully demonstrating the leading and exemplary role of a representative of the working class.

The newly established power organ is new in its resolute execution of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

On May 10th of this year, when the Liaoning Revolutionary Committee was established, Committee Director Chen Xilian led everyone to eat a meal of bitter memories. The meal was made from tofu dregs. Wei Fengying, who is usually very frugal in her daily life, ate a double portion this time. As she ate the bitter meal, she thought a lot.

Her grandfather, father, and brother were all workers, but in the old society, they, like millions of other workers and poor peasants, could only be treated like beasts of burden and had no control over their own destinies. Why? Because the laboring people did not have political power.

After liberation, over the past seventeen years, China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places have been able to push their counter-revolutionary revisionist line because they had usurped the power of the party, government, economy, and culture in some regions, departments, and units.

Now, as a representative of the working class, she has joined the three-in-one revolutionary committee. How can she seize and use power well? At first, Wei Fengying was not without concerns. She was just an ordinary stamping worker and had never handled such big affairs or shouldered such heavy responsibilities. She was afraid of not doing a good job and disappointing the great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and the 28 million people of Liaoning Province.

At this time, she remembered Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: "A ship on the vast ocean needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought." Indeed, "The revolutionary leading class is the working class." The working class is the most capable of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought and is the most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought, one can lead everything and overcome everything.

In the work of the revolutionary committee, whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, she would resolutely carry out and implement thoroughly; whatever goes against Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, she would resolutely resist and fight against.

After the establishment of the Liaoning Revolutionary Committee, it resolutely implemented the series of instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, focusing on class struggle and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, determined to thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast China and the Liaoning and Shenyang regions. However, the class enemies were like winter onions, with yellow leaves and withered roots but not dead. Just the day after the celebration of the establishment of the Liaoning Province and Shenyang City Revolutionary Committees, a rightist wind of reversal emerged in society. Some people were summoning the spirits of China's Khrushchev's agents in Northeast China, and some were pleading for them. What nonsense about certain people being unyielding! What nonsense about criticizing them not being the main direction! Even threatening that the class struggle in the Liaoning and Shenyang regions would have major reversals.

"Never forget class struggle!" The vast majority of members of the provincial revolutionary committee immediately realized that this was a continuation of the struggle between the two classes and two lines in the new situation, and the class enemies were challenging the newly established power organ! They fought a head-on battle against this black wind that blew out of the sewer. Wei Fengying, with the determination that "whoever opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, even if it costs one's head, must fight to the end," stood at the forefront of the class struggle.

Wei Fengying said firmly: "We seize power to firmly grasp class struggle and to thoroughly criticize and expose a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders, traitors, and spies, making them never able to rise again. Whoever tries to reverse the verdict on the capitalist-roaders and make us suffer again, not a single chance!"

Wei Fengying harbored deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. She often said: "Those who cannot hate the capitalist-roaders are fake loyalists to Chairman Mao; those who do not execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are fake haters of the capitalist-roaders."

Over the past few months, she has been to factories and rural areas. Wherever she went, she would investigate the movements of the class enemies and expose the crimes of the capitalist-roaders. Once, when she went to the countryside, Wei Fengying led the revolutionary criticism on the train. The carriage became a battlefield for eliminating the poison of the capitalist-roaders and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. When some passengers found out that she was Wei Fengying, they excitedly said: "Truly a good worker of Chairman Mao. With such a person in power, power is firmly in the right hands!"

Under the strong command of the Liaoning Revolutionary Committee, the black wind of reversal stirred up by the class enemies was struck down. The 28 million people of Liaoning Province launched wave after wave of criticism and struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders, traitors, and spies in Northeast China and the Liaoning and Shenyang regions.

In Wei Fengying's view, the revolutionary committee is a new power organ, and it is new in its resolute execution of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary committee must always execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line under any circumstances and must constantly struggle against the old ideas and habits of the exploiting class. She often said: "Struggle is the basic content of our lives. Unless we thoroughly smash the revisionist stuff, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line cannot be unobstructed, and the red mountains and rivers cannot be protected."

Clench into a fist to strike the enemy hard

At the critical moment of the great struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the Liaoning and Shenyang regions, because Wei Fengying was not afraid of threats and was not deceived, she bravely fought on the front line. A handful of capitalist-roaders, traitors, and spies in Northeast China and the Liaoning and Shenyang regions regarded her as a thorn in their side. Just as they were frantically attacking and persecuting Comrade Wei Fengying, some workers in the factory who did not understand the situation also posted big-character posters on her.

It was one day in May last year. Wei Fengying's apprentice Yuan Guimin returned to the dormitory after work. As soon as she reached the door, she saw that it was covered with big-character posters saying "Wei Fengying is the biggest royalist clown," and so on. Little Yuan was so angry that she almost burst with rage. The first person to expose the factory's leadership executing the bourgeois reactionary line was Teacher Wei, and the first person to rebel against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory party was also Teacher Wei. How could she be called a "royalist"? Little Yuan went into the room and, without saying a word, took out some chalk with a few comrades and started writing on the walls and floors inside and outside the house: "Learn from Comrade Wei Fengying, a good worker of Chairman Mao!" "Whoever protects a handful of capitalist-roaders will have no good end!" The next day, these slogans were erased, but she wrote them again. This went on for several rounds.

This incident was soon known to Wei Fengying. She seriously told Little Yuan: "What you did is wrong and fell right into the trap of the capitalist-roaders. What you did only deepened the contradictions among the masses, affected unity, and was not conducive to grasping the main direction of the struggle. You should put your energy into thoroughly criticizing and exposing a handful of capitalist-roaders."

A few days later, Wei Fengying asked Little Yuan another question: "Do you know how China's Khrushchev's agents in Northeast China and the Liaoning and Shenyang regions suppressed the revolutionary masses?" Little Yuan said she was not very clear. At this time, Wei Fengying criticized Little Yuan: "The other day, revolutionary masses posted a few big-character posters on me, and you were so serious and put in so much effort; but when it comes to criticizing the class enemies—the crimes of the capitalist-roaders in Northeast China, you are not very concerned. That won't do! In the future, you must remember Chairman Mao's words, distinguish between friends and enemies, and firmly grasp the main direction of the struggle." Under Wei Fengying's patient guidance, Little Yuan understood how to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and become a true revolutionary fighter of the proletariat.

"When Wei Fengying thinks and does things, she always considers the big picture and understands the big principles!" Revolutionary comrades who have fought alongside Wei Fengying say this. Even those who have opposed Wei Fengying also say this.

In the stormy waves of class struggle, Wei Fengying closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and quickly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In August last year, Wei Fengying, as a representative of a mass organization, came to Beijing. After a period of study by the side of our great leader Chairman Mao, Wei Fengying received great education. Chairman Mao issued the great teaching that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two major factions that are irreconcilable." This made Wei Fengying more aware of her responsibility. She thought: Why did the working class split into several factions? This was all the doing of the capitalist-roaders. If we continue to split, we will fall into the trap of the class enemies.

At that time, the antagonistic sentiments between the representatives of the three revolutionary mass organizations in Shenyang were very strong. Wei Fengying, following Chairman Mao's teachings, led her organization's comrades to first visit the residences of the other two organizations and actively made self-criticisms. She said: "In the past, the capitalist-roaders divided us into this faction and that faction. We proletarian revolutionaries must clench into a fist and twist into a rope to strike the enemy hard!" Wei Fengying's exemplary actions deeply influenced the comrades of the other organizations. Under the warm care of the central leaders and the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the three revolutionary mass organizations in Shenyang soon reached an agreement to achieve great unity.

Chairman Mao waved his mighty hand, and Wei Fengying quickly moved forward. When she returned to Shenyang to promote unity, she heard that the workshop she was in had not yet achieved great unity, so she went back to the workshop to do the work. At that time, some workers in the workshop, stirred up by the capitalist-roaders, were still holding back some resentment about achieving great unity. She went to talk to them the first time and was pushed back; the second time she went, some people ignored her. Wei Fengying did not mind at all. She patiently explained to everyone the significance of achieving great unity and studied the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them. Finally, she sincerely said: "Chairman Mao has waved to us, and if we do not quickly follow and unite, we will disappoint Chairman Mao! We will disappoint the people of the entire province!" Wei Fengying's open and upright heart moved the comrades present. Some actively shook hands with her, and those who had previously opposed her also made self-criticisms.

"Proletarian revolutionaries are one faction." In daily life, whenever Wei Fengying heard someone say something that was not conducive to the unity of the revolutionaries, she would immediately step forward to stop it. She truly did what she said: "Be open-hearted, loyal, active, and put revolutionary interests first."

Always be an ordinary worker

The work of the revolutionary committee is complex and varied. Where should one start? Wei Fengying, this ordinary stamping worker, often pondered this question after stepping into the door of the provincial revolutionary committee.

"Reforming state organs, the most fundamental thing is to connect with the masses." Chairman Mao's wise teachings pointed the way for Wei Fengying. Wei Fengying still remembers: On the first night she came to the provincial revolutionary committee, an old worker who had fought side by side with her took her hand and solemnly advised her: "Big Wei, once you're in the revolutionary committee, don't forget to often go back to the workers!" The words were few, but they deeply touched Wei Fengying's heartstrings. Wei Fengying thought: Right! Why did some cadres receive criticism from the masses in the past? A very important reason was that they were high above the masses, acting like officials and lords, not consulting with the masses on important matters, and seriously alienating themselves from the masses.

After Wei Fengying took up the position of deputy director of the provincial revolutionary committee, whenever she had a little time, she would go to the masses, to factories and rural areas to participate in labor, conduct investigations, and consult with the masses. Whenever she went to factories and rural areas, she would immediately blend in with the workers and poor peasants there.

Once, she and a few comrades went to a factory. As soon as they entered the factory, they worked hard with the workers, participated in meetings, and studied together. In their contact with the workers, she and the comrades who came with her discovered: Although the factory had already established a revolutionary committee, in some workshops, the mass organizations still played a certain leading role. For example: When the workshop revolutionary committee held an activity, people did not come so promptly; when the mass organization held a meeting, people came in large numbers. Why was this? She and a few comrades talked with the worker comrades, listened to their opinions, and after analysis and research, believed that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, it was necessary to actively establish workers' congresses to adapt to the new situation. Wei Fengying and the comrades who went with her immediately proposed to the factory revolutionary committee to quickly establish a workers' congress. The factory revolutionary committee seriously studied the suggestions of Wei Fengying and the other comrades and quickly established the factory's workers' congress.

Once, she went to a factory to participate in labor. Many worker comrades surrounded her, expressing their desire to learn from her. She replied: "What I do is not enough, I should learn from you comrades. I am just an ordinary worker, the same as everyone else."

Because she was not a fitter and the work was heavy, the master suggested she rest for a while. She said: "No need, I am a worker, I am used to labor. Master Yuan, do you think my work quality is okay?"

While working, she was called to the phone twice, and she habitually went to the foreman: "Master Chang, I have something to do, I'll take a leave of absence, I'll be back in a while." Later, Master Chang told others: "Wei Fengying is truly a good representative of the working class. She temporarily came to the workshop to work and still followed the labor discipline so strictly, we all should learn from her."

Wei Fengying often said: "In front of the working class, in front of the poor peasants, in front of the People's Liberation Army, I am forever an ungraduated little student." She said this and did it this way.

One morning, Wei Fengying went to get water and saw a soldier helping an old worker who was not very literate to study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." She suddenly felt her face flush. She scolded herself: I come to get water every day, why didn't I think of helping this illiterate old worker to study Chairman Mao's works? The People's Liberation Army is truly outstanding in everything, promoting Mao Zedong Thought everywhere!

She went to the countryside to participate in anti-drought efforts and saw a seventy-year-old poor peasant woman and a six-year-old granddaughter carrying water to fight the drought. She saw that in the face of severe drought, the poor peasants worked hard to water the fields during the day and still insisted on carrying out revolutionary criticism and holding study sessions at night. Wei Fengying deeply felt that the poor peasants' hearts, which believed in Chairman Mao and not in heaven or earth, and their revolutionary spirit of enduring hardships and laboring hard, were all things she should learn.

Wherever Wei Fengying went, she always sincerely said: "I come with a bag to learn." Especially after she became the deputy director of the provincial revolutionary committee, her "bag" was even bigger.

Revolution is done with Mao Zedong Thought

Wei Fengying is a good worker of Chairman Mao. In all good ways, she is good at learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought and is unyieldingly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In August last year, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was deepening, a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders plotted to create divisions among the proletarian revolutionaries. At this time, an ultra-leftist trend also emerged in the revolutionary ranks. One day, a responsible person from a mass organization in another place found Wei Fengying and said: "In the past, we supported your mass organization, and we were wrong. We are now taking it back and will not support you anymore." Wei Fengying calmly replied to this comrade-in-arms who had fought together: "That's no problem. We do revolution relying on Mao Zedong Thought, not on others' support. As long as the direction of the struggle is correct, others support the revolution, others do not support the revolution, we still do the revolution."

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Wei Fengying not only recited this truth over and over again but also practiced it thousands of times.

After Wei Fengying took up the position of deputy director of the provincial revolutionary committee, her status changed, and she first thought of the heavy responsibility on her shoulders. She must work harder to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Those who are familiar with her know that in her bag, in addition to Chairman Mao's latest instructions and newspapers, there are three treasures: "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Old Five Articles," and "Sixteen Points." Even if it is just a little time before meals or during breaks in meetings, she would not miss the opportunity to study. Recently, she and some comrades took a train to a rural area to participate in the anti-drought struggle. At the train station, there was half an hour of waiting time, and Wei Fengying suggested finding a quiet place to study Chairman Mao's instructions for a while. Wei Fengying said: "We are going to the countryside to fight the drought and conduct investigations. The first preparation is to prepare Mao Zedong Thought, this sharpest weapon."

Comrade Wei Fengying often said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the treasure of treasures, doing revolution cannot be without it for a moment." For every new instruction from Chairman Mao, she would seize the time to study it. On August 15th, when Wei Fengying and some comrades from the provincial revolutionary committee were participating in the anti-drought struggle in the countryside, Chairman Mao's latest instruction "Our country has 700 million people, the working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle" was issued. At that time, Wei Fengying was discussing with a few comrades how to report to the local leadership, and when she heard that Chairman Mao's latest instruction was broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station, she immediately ran out and wrote down the latest instruction to study and discuss with her comrades. Some comrades said: "Let's discuss this report first and then study!" Wei Fengying insisted: "No, studying Chairman Mao's latest instruction is more important." Later, when this matter was mentioned, the comrades all thought Wei Fengying was right and insisted correctly. Wei Fengying always placed the study and execution of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and earlier than everything, and she would never waver under any circumstances.

Comrade Wei Fengying wrote passionately in her diary:

Love the great leader Chairman Mao, never leave "public";
Study Mao Zedong Thought, never leave "use";
Execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, never leave "loyal."

Now, Comrade Wei Fengying, under the nurturing of the sun and rain of Mao Zedong Thought, is sailing against the wind and waves, striding forward!

    永远保持工人阶级的本色
    ——记尉凤英同志在无产阶级文化大革命中的先进事迹
    在沈阳市工厂区，人们常常可以看到一位穿着朴素的女同志，骑着一辆旧自行车，匆匆地跑来跑去。她，就是毛主席的好工人、辽宁省革命委员会副主任尉凤英同志。
    两年多来，尉凤英同志经历了无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，经受了两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线斗争的严峻考验。她和辽沈地区广大无产阶级革命派一起，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，顶逆风，战恶浪，造了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东北和辽沈地区代理人的反，坚决执行、勇敢捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为人民立下了新功。在新生的革命委员会里，她以无限忠于毛主席的一颗红心，为无产阶级掌好权、用好权，充分显示出工人阶级代表的带头和模范作用。
    新生的权力机构，就新在坚决执行毛主席的革命路线上
    今年五月十日，辽宁省革命委员会成立那天，革委会主任陈锡联同志带领大家吃忆苦饭。饭是用豆腐渣做的。平日在生活上十分节俭的尉凤英同志，这一顿吃了个双份。吃着忆苦饭，她想得很多。
    她爷爷、爸爸、哥哥都是工人，但是在旧社会，他们和千千万万的工人、贫下中农一样，只能当牛马，掌握不了自己的命运。为什么？因为劳动人民没有掌握政权。
    解放后十七年来，中国赫鲁晓夫和他在各地的代理人，所以能够推行他们的反革命修正主义路线，也是因为他们篡夺了一些地区、一些部门、一些单位的党、政、财、文大权。
    如今，自己以工人阶级代表的身份，参加了三结合的革命委员会，怎样才能掌好权、用好权？开始，尉凤英不是没有顾虑的。自己是个普通的冲压工人，过去没有管过这么大的事，挑过这么重的担子。她担心搞不好工作，会辜负伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席以及辽宁省二千八百万人民的期望。
    这时，她记起林副主席的指示：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”是啊！“革命的领导阶级是工人阶级。”工人阶级最能学好用好毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。靠伟大的毛泽东思想，就能够领导一切，战胜一切。
    在革命委员会的各项工作中，凡是符合毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线的，她就坚决照办，彻底执行；凡是违背毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线的，她就坚决抵制，坚决斗争。
    辽宁省革委会成立以后，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席的一系列指示，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，决心把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东北和辽沈地区的代理人批倒批臭。但是，阶级敌人象是冬天的大葱，叶黄根枯心不死。就在开过庆祝辽宁省和沈阳市革命委员会成立大会的第二天，社会上出现了一股右倾翻案妖风。有的人为中国赫鲁晓夫在东北地区的代理人招魂，有的人为他们喊冤叫屈。什么某某人打不倒啦！什么批判他们不是大方向啦！甚至威胁说：辽沈地区的阶级斗争还要有大的反复。
    “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”！省革委会的绝大多数成员立刻认识到，这是在新的形势下两个阶级、两条路线斗争的继续，阶级敌人在向新生的权力机构挑战了！他们同这股从阴沟里刮出来的黑风作了针锋相对的斗争。尉凤英怀着“谁要反对毛主席的革命路线，就是掉了脑袋也要同他拚”的决心，站到阶级斗争的第一线。
    尉凤英斩钉截铁地说：“我们掌权，就是要紧紧抓阶级斗争，就是要把一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务批倒批臭，使他们永世不得翻身。谁要为走资派翻案，要想使我们受二遍苦，一万个办不到！”尉凤英对中国赫鲁晓夫怀着刻骨仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席充满了无限热爱。她经常说：“对走资派恨不起来的人，对毛主席的亲就是假亲；不执行毛主席革命路线的人，对走资派的恨也是假恨。”
    几个月来，她到过工厂、农村，走到那里，就在那里摸阶级敌人的动向，揭露走资派的罪行。一次到农村去，尉凤英在火车上带头搞起革命大批判。把车厢变成肃清走资派流毒，捍卫毛主席革命路线的战场。当有的旅客知道她就是尉凤英时，激动地说：“真不愧为毛主席的好工人。有这样的人掌权，掌得牢！”
    在辽宁省革委会的坚强指挥下，阶级敌人掀起的翻案妖风，受到了迎头痛击。辽宁省二千八百万人民对东北和辽沈地区一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务的批判、斗争，一浪高过一浪。
    在尉凤英看来，革委会是新生的权力机构，新就新在坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上；而革委会要在任何情况下都要永远执行毛主席的革命路线，要随时随地同剥削阶级的旧观念、旧习惯进行斗争。她经常说：“斗争是我们生活的基本内容。不把修正主义的那一套彻底砸烂，毛主席的革命路线就不能畅通无阻，红色江山就保不住。”
    攥成一个拳头，才能狠狠打击敌人
    在辽沈地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战的关键时刻，由于尉凤英不怕威胁，不受欺骗，勇敢地战斗在第一线，东北和辽沈地区的一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务，把她视为眼中钉，肉中刺。就在他们疯狂地打击和迫害尉凤英同志的时候，厂内一些不明真象的群众，也给她贴了一些大字报。
    那是去年五月的一天，尉凤英的徒弟袁桂敏下班回宿舍，一到门口，就看到门上被人贴满了“尉凤英是最大的保皇小丑”等大标语。小袁一看简直肺都要气炸了。第一个起来揭发车间领导执行资产阶级反动路线的是尉师傅，最早起来造工厂党内一小撮走资派的反的也有尉师傅。怎么能说她“保皇”呢？小袁进屋，二话没说，就和几个同志一起拿起粉笔，在屋里屋外、墙上地下写了起来：“向毛主席的好工人——尉凤英同志学习！”“谁死保一小撮走资派，绝没有好下场！”第二天这些标语被人擦掉了，她再写上。就这样写了被擦掉，擦掉再写上，一连拉扯了几个回合。
    这件事，很快地被尉凤英知道了。她严肃地对小袁说：“你这么干是错误的，正好上了走资派的当。你这样做，只能加深群众之间的矛盾，影响团结，不利于抓斗争的大方向。你应该把这股劲使到狠揭猛批一小撮走资派上去。”
    过了几天，尉凤英又向小袁提一个问题：“你知道中国赫鲁晓夫在东北地区的代理人，在辽沈地区怎样镇压革命群众的？”小袁说还不大清楚。这时尉凤英就批评小袁说：“那天革命群众给我贴了几张大字报，你就那么认真，使出那么大的劲；对于批判阶级敌人——东北地区的走资派的罪行，你却不大关心，这那行？以后可要牢牢记住毛主席的话，分清谁是朋友，谁是敌人，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。”在尉凤英的耐心帮助下，小袁懂得了应当怎样紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，做一个真正的无产阶级革命派战士。
    “尉凤英想问题，办事情，就是顾大局、识大体！”跟尉凤英共同战斗过的革命战友这样说。曾经反对过尉凤英的同志也这样说。
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，尉凤英对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得紧，对毛主席的最新指示落实得快。去年八月，尉凤英作为一个群众组织的代表，来到北京。在我们伟大领袖毛主席的身边，经过一段学习之后，尉凤英受到很大教育。毛主席发出了“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的伟大教导，使尉凤英更加认识到自己的责任。她想：我们工人阶级为什么会分成几大派？这都是走资派搞的鬼。如果再分裂下去，就上了阶级敌人的当了。
    那时，沈阳三大革命群众组织赴京代表之间的对立情绪很大。尉凤英按照毛主席的教导，带领自己那个组织的同志，首先到另外两个组织的住处去登门走访，主动地做自我批评。她说：“过去走资派把我们分成了这一派，那一派。我们无产阶级革命派要攥成一个拳头，拧成一股绳，才能狠狠打击敌人！”尉凤英的模范行动，深深地影响了其它组织的同志。在中央首长的亲切关怀和解放军的大力帮助下，不久，沈阳三大革命群众组织就达成了实现革命大联合的协议。
    毛主席挥动巨手，尉凤英就快步前进。她在回沈阳促进联合时，听说她所在的车间还没有实现革命大联合，就回车间做工作。当时，车间有的工人由于受走资派的挑动，对于实现革命大联合还憋着一股劲。她第一次去谈，被顶回来了；第二次又去，开始有的人不理她。尉凤英都没放在心上，她耐心地向大家宣传实现革命大联合的意义，跟他们一起学习《毛主席语录》。最后，她诚恳地说：“毛主席已经向我们挥手了，我们再不紧跟，还不联合，对不起毛主席！对不起全省人民！”尉凤英坦荡无私的胸怀，感动了在场的同志。有的主动地跟她握手，原来曾经反对过她的人，事后也作了自我批评。
      “无产阶级革命派是一派。”在平时，尉凤英只要听到有人说不利于革命派团结的话，她就立即站出来加以制止。她真正做到了：“襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命”。
    永远做一名普通的工人
    革命委员会的工作千头万绪，从哪做起呢？尉凤英，这个普通的冲压工人，从跨进省革委会的大门之后，常常思索着这个问题。
      “国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”毛主席这一英明的教导，给尉凤英指明了方向。尉凤英还记得：在她来到省革委会的头一天晚上，一位跟她并肩战斗过的老工人，紧握着她的手，语重心长地叮嘱过她：“大尉啊！进了革委会，可别忘了常往咱工人堆里跑啊！”话虽然不多，却深深触动着尉凤英的心弦。尉凤英想：对啊！过去有些干部为什么会受到群众的批判呢？很重要的一条就是高高在上，当官做老爷，有事不跟群众商量，严重地脱离了群众。
    尉凤英担任省革委会副主任后，只要有一点时间，她总要往群众里跑，到工厂、农村去参加劳动，搞调查研究，向群众请教。她每到工厂和农村，就立即和那里的工人、贫下中农打成一片。
    有一次，她和几个同志到一个工厂去，一进厂就踏踏实实地和工人们一起劳动，一起参加会议，一起学习。在和工人接触中，她和同来的同志发现：这个厂虽然已经成立革命委员会了，但是在有些车间，群众组织还起着某种程度的领导作用。例如：车间革委会搞个活动，人来的不那么齐；群众组织开个大会，人来的却特别多。这是为什么？她和几位同志又找工人同志谈心，听取他们的意见，经过分析研究，认为在革委会成立以后，应该积极建立工代会，才能适应新的形势。尉凤英和一起去的同志，立即向厂革委会提出迅速成立工代会的建议。厂革委会认真地研究了尉凤英等同志的建议，很快地成立了工厂的工代会。
    有一次，她到工厂参加劳动，许多工人同志围住她，表示要向她学习。她回答说：“我做的很不够，要向同志们学习。我和大家一样，永远是一名普通的工人。”
    因为她本来不是钳工，活又很重，老师傅劝她休息一会儿。她说：“用不着，我是个工人，劳动惯了。苑师傅，你看我干这活的质量行不行？”
    正在干活时，有两次叫她接电话，她都是习惯地走到组长面前：“常师傅，我有点事，请个假，一会就来。”事后，常师傅向别人说：“尉凤英真是工人阶级的好代表。她临时来车间劳动，还那么遵守劳动纪律，我们都应该向她学习。”
    尉凤英经常说：“在工人阶级面前，在贫下中农面前，在解放军面前，我永远是没有毕业的小学生。”她这样说，也是这样做的。
    一天早晨，尉凤英去打开水，看到一位解放军同志在帮助烧水的老工人学习《毛主席语录》。她顿时觉得脸上热乎乎的。她暗暗责备自己：我天天来打开水，怎么就没想到帮助这位不大识字的老工人学习毛主席著作呢？解放军真是事事突出政治，处处宣传毛泽东思想啊！
    她到农村去参加抗旱，看到七十多岁的贫农老大娘和一个六岁的孙女，一起抬水抗旱，看到在严重的干旱面前，贫下中农白天热火朝天地浇水，晚上还照样坚持搞大批判，开讲用会。尉凤英深深感到：贫下中农这种不信天不信地，一心信仰毛主席的颗颗红心，和那种吃大苦、耐大劳的革命精神，都是自己应该学到手的。
    尉凤英每到一处，总是诚心实意地说：“我是背着口袋来学习的。”特别是在她当了省革委会副主任以后，她的这个“口袋”撑得更大了。
    干革命靠的是毛泽东思想
    尉凤英是毛主席的好工人。千好万好，就好在活学活用毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线上。
    去年八月间，正当无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的时候，一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，阴谋在无产阶级革命派中制造分裂。这时，在革命队伍中也出现一股极“左”思潮。一天，外地一个学校的群众组织的负责人，找到尉凤英说：“过去我们支持你们这个群众组织，支持错了。我们现在要收回去，以后不支持你们了。”尉凤英冷静地回答这位共同战斗过的同志说：“那没有什么关系。我们干革命，靠的是毛泽东思想，不是靠别人支持的。只要是斗争大方向正确，别人支持要革命，别人不支持也要革命。”
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”尉凤英不只是一遍又一遍地背诵，而且是千百次地在实践着这句真理。
    尉凤英担任省革委会副主任后，地位变了，她首先想到的是肩上的担子重了，要比过去更加努力学好用好毛泽东思想。熟悉她的同志都知道，她身上背的挎包里，除了毛主席的最新指示和报纸外，还有三件宝：《毛主席语录》、“老五篇”和《十六条》。那怕是饭前、会议中间休息的一点点时间，她也不放过学习。最近她和一些同志乘火车到农村参加抗旱斗争，在火车站有半小时的候车时间，尉凤英提议，找个僻静的地方，学习一会毛主席指示。尉凤英说：“我们要去农村抗旱和进行调查研究，第一位的准备工作是准备毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器。”
    尉凤英同志经常说：“毛泽东思想是宝中宝，干革命一时一刻离不了。”对于毛主席发出的每一个最新指示，她都是分秒必争，抓紧学习。八月十五日，正当尉凤英和省革委会的一些同志在农村参加抗旱的时候，毛主席的最新指示“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”发表了，这时，尉凤英正和几个同志一起讨论给当地领导机关汇报的事，听说毛主席这一最新指示由中央人民广播电台广播了，她就立刻跑出去，把最新指示记下来，要和同志们一起学习、讨论。有的同志说：“等商量好这个汇报的事再学习吧！”尉凤英坚持说：“不，还是学习毛主席的最新指示重要。”事后，提起这件事，同志们都认为尉凤英做得对，坚持得好。尉凤英就是这样把学习、执行毛主席的最新指示放在高于一切、大于一切、重于一切、先于一切的地位，在任何情况下决不动摇。
    尉凤英同志满怀激情地在日记中写道：
    热爱伟大领袖毛主席，时刻不离“公”；
    学习毛泽东思想，行动不离“用”；
    执行毛主席的革命路线，永远不离“忠”。
    现在，尉凤英同志，正在毛泽东思想阳光雨露的哺育下，乘风破浪，阔步前进！
