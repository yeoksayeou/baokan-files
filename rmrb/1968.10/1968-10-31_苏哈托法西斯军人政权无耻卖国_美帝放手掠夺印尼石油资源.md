According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, the U.S. imperialist oil monopolies are increasingly plundering Indonesia's oil resources.

In recent months, U.S. oil monopoly companies have obtained more privileges to exploit oil from the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. It is reported that in July, the U.S. Standard Oil Company signed a 30-year contract with the Indonesian reactionary authorities, gaining the privilege to plunder oil in East Kalimantan. In August, two other U.S. oil monopoly companies obtained the privilege to exploit oil in the oil-rich islands of Kalimantan and Sumatra. At the beginning of September, the U.S. Independent Oil Company signed an oil agreement with the Indonesian reactionary regime. This U.S. oil monopoly company had already started plundering oil in the coastal areas of West Java, and now, according to this agreement, it will plunder oil in the southern region of Sumatra, covering an area of 110,000 square kilometers, with a daily production of 75,000 barrels for 30 years.

The U.S. Standard Oil Company, which had infiltrated Indonesia's largest oil-producing area—the central part of Sumatra Island—as early as 1924, is now, with the cooperation of the Indonesian fascist military regime, accelerating its plundering steps. According to a recent revelation by the Indonesian official mouthpiece, Antara News Agency, the average daily oil production of this U.S. oil monopoly company has increased from 15,000 barrels in 1952 to 401,000 barrels in the first half of this year, an increase of 27 times.

The head of the Indonesian reactionary regime, Suharto, shows great concern for the U.S. Standard Oil Company, recently leading a large entourage to the "largest oil-producing area" of the U.S. in Indonesia for an "on-site inspection." Soon after, the Suharto reactionary regime announced more favorable privileges for the Standard Oil Company. Subsequently, this U.S. oil monopoly company immediately accelerated its plundering steps.

Now, Indonesia has become an important oil supply base for U.S. imperialism's aggressive policy in Southeast Asia.

    苏哈托法西斯军人政权无耻卖国
    美帝放手掠夺印尼石油资源
    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义石油垄断资本正在变本加厉地掠夺印度尼西亚的石油资源。
    最近几个月来，美国石油垄断公司从苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权手里，获得了更多的开采石油的特权。据报道，今年七月，美国德士古石油垄断公司同印尼反动当局签订了一项为期三十年的合同，获得了掠夺印尼东部哈马里拉岛石油的特权。八月，另外两家美国石油垄断公司又获得了在加里曼丹和苏门答腊等盛产石油的岛屿开采石油的特权。九月初，美国独立石油公司又同印尼反动政权签订一项石油协定。这家美国石油垄断公司早就在西爪哇沿海地带开始掠夺石油，现在，根据这个协定，它将在苏门答腊南部地区十一万平方公里的地区，以每天七万五千桶的产量，强取豪夺印尼石油三十年。
    早在一九二四年就已渗入印尼最大的产油区——苏门答腊岛中部的美国德士古石油垄断公司，目前在印尼法西斯军人政权的配合下，正在加快掠夺的步伐。据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社不久前透露，这家美国石油垄断公司的平均石油日产量已由一九五二年的一万五千桶提高到今年上半年的四十万一千桶，增加二十七倍。
    印尼反动政权头目苏哈托对美国德士古石油公司关怀备至，最近公然率领大批人马前往这个美国在印尼的“最大的产油区”进行“就地视察”。不久后，苏哈托反动政权又宣布，给德士古石油公司以更加优惠的特权。此后，这家美国石油垄断公司便立即加快了它的掠夺的步伐。
    现在印度尼西亚已经成了美帝在东南亚推行侵略政策的重要石油供应基地。
