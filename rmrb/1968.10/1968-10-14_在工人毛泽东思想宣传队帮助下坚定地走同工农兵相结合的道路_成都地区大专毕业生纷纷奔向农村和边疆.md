With the leadership and assistance of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, graduates from colleges and universities in the Chengdu region are enthusiastically taking the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are heading to rural areas, border regions, and the most arduous places to participate in labor and receive re-education from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Currently, over 9,000 graduates from the classes of 1966 and 1967 have, according to the needs of the state, embarked on new revolutionary journeys.

With the help of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams that entered the schools, many graduates held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, systematically summarizing the experiences and lessons they gained during the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. From their personal experiences, they deeply felt the need to go to the workers and peasants to receive re-education and to face new challenges in the midst of the people's struggles. Many revolutionary youngsters who made contributions during the Cultural Revolution said with deep feelings: During the Cultural Revolution, they followed Chairman Mao's words, rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and took the correct path. Now, they must continue to follow Chairman Mao's words, rebel against the bourgeois "self" in their minds, and steadfastly advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Many leaders of the revolutionary rebel factions in the schools took the initiative to request to be assigned to the most arduous places.

The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams also helped the graduates carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing the revisionist educational line, especially the counter-revolutionary revisionist distribution line. The graduates said, China's Khrushchev and his agents on the educational front have long pushed a revisionist line in the distribution of graduates, emphasizing the upper levels and neglecting the grassroots, and prioritizing cities over rural areas. This, in essence, aims to cultivate students into "special individuals" detached from the masses and labor, to facilitate the restoration of capitalism. We must adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, go to the countryside, go to the border regions, go to the factories and mines, go to the grassroots, and undergo tempering and testing on the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements.

The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams that entered various colleges and universities also used their own bitter family histories to educate the young students, inspiring them to always follow Chairman Mao's words, never forget the sufferings of the working people, and take the path of integrating with the workers and peasants. The old workers' teachings deeply educated the graduates, arousing in them a deep hatred for the old society and China's Khrushchev, and an unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In one class at Sichuan Normal University, only 15% of the graduates were willing to go to the most arduous minority regions during their first round of filling out assignment forms. After the workers' education, the graduates enthusiastically requested to modify their assignments to go to the arduous places, and the number of volunteers to go to the minority regions in the class increased to 85%.

    在工人毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下坚定地走同工农兵相结合的道路
    成都地区大专毕业生纷纷奔向农村和边疆
    新华社成都十二日电　成都地区大专院校毕业生在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导和帮助下，纷纷走上和工农群众相结合的道路，到农村去，到边疆去，到最艰苦的地方去，参加劳动，接受工农兵群众的再教育。现在，九千多名一九六六年和一九六七年大专院校毕业生，已根据国家需要陆续踏上新的革命征途。
    许多毕业生在进驻学校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，举办了毛泽东思想学习班，系统地总结自己在两年多的无产阶级文化大革命中受到的锻炼和获得的经验教训。他们从自己的亲身经历中深切感受到，自己需要到工农群众中去接受再教育，到群众斗争的大风大浪中去接受新的考验。不少在文化大革命中作出了贡献的革命小将深有体会地说：在文化大革命中，自己听了毛主席的话，造了党内一小撮走资派的反，路走对了。现在更要听毛主席的话，造自己头脑里资产阶级“私”字的反，沿着毛主席指引的方向坚定不移地向前进。许多学校革命造反派的负责人，都带头要求分配到最艰苦的地方去。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队还帮助广大毕业生深入地开展革命的大批判，狠狠批判了修正主义的教育路线，特别是反革命修正主义的分配路线。毕业生们说，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育战线上的代理人，长期以来在毕业生分配上推行了一条重上层、轻基层，重城市、轻农村的修正主义路线，这实质上是要将青年学生培养成脱离群众、脱离劳动的“特殊人物”，以便复辟资本主义。我们一定要遵循毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，在三大革命运动的第一线经受锻炼和考验。
    进驻各大专院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，还以自己的血泪家史，向青年学生进行阶级教育，启发他们永远听毛主席的话，不忘劳动人民的苦，走和工农群众结合的路。老工人的教诲，使毕业生受到深刻的教育，激发起了他们对旧社会、对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，对毛主席革命路线的无限忠诚。四川师范学院一个班的毕业生第一次填分配志愿时，只有百分之十五的人愿意到最艰苦的少数民族地区去，在工人们的教育下，毕业生们纷纷要求修改志愿，到艰苦的地方去，全班报名到少数民族地区的人一下增加到百分之八十五。
