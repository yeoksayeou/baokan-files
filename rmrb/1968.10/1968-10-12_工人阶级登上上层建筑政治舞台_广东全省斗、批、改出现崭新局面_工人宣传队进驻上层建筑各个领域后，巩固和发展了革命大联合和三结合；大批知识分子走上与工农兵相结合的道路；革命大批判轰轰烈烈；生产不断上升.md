Under the guidance of the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, the working class of Guangdong Province, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, has sent large numbers of propaganda teams, composed mainly of outstanding industrial workers, to the political stage of struggle, criticism, and reform in various domains of the superstructure. This has powerfully consolidated and developed the excellent revolutionary situation throughout the province. Many grassroots units, with the help of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, have quickly established revolutionary leadership bodies composed of the three-in-one combination. The entire province has achieved a red tide from top to bottom. A mighty wave of struggle, criticism, and reform is sweeping across the province.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work." Since mid-August, the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee and various levels of revolutionary committees, in order to implement and carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have sent large numbers of workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. With the participation and support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, they have entered the fields of education, arts, news, health, and other domains of the superstructure, as well as other units where struggle, criticism, and reform have not been well carried out.

After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entered various domains of the superstructure, they powerfully consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination throughout the province. In the previous period, revolutionary committees had already been established in all administrative districts, prefectures, counties, cities, and people's communes throughout the province. Recently, in the eight administrative districts and prefectures of Huizhou, Foshan, Meixian, Hainan, Zhaoqing, Zhanjiang, Shaoguan, and Shantou, all organs, schools, factories, and other grassroots units have established revolutionary leadership bodies composed of the three-in-one combination. In Guangzhou City, more than 98% of the factories and enterprises have established revolutionary committees, and among them, the railway, transportation, shipping, power, metallurgy, and chemical industries, and ten other systems have achieved a red tide from top to bottom. Many "difficult" units throughout the province have quickly achieved the three-in-one combination after the workers' propaganda teams entered. Institutions of higher learning such as Zhongshan University, Jinan University, and Zhongshan Medical College, which in the past were disrupted by class enemies and interfered with by bourgeois factionalism, resulting in long-term opposition and internal strife between the two factions, have now achieved revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination after the workers' propaganda teams entered the schools.

The workers' propaganda teams, after entering various domains of the superstructure, have placed the propagation and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the most important position, insisting on using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals. They have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes in all the units they have entered, vigorously promoting the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice, helping intellectuals overcome the bad habit of separating theory from practice, continuously raising intellectuals' class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, strengthening their deep feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the great Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and earnestly implementing the series of latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao. Under the education of the workers, a large number of intellectuals throughout the province have happily embarked on the broad road of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, in various units, have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, mobilized the masses extensively, and carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, quickly changing the backward situation in some units. The workers' propaganda teams have led the broad revolutionary masses in these units to combine revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of the class ranks, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, and at the same time, thoroughly exposing a handful of class enemies who have hidden themselves. In the process of leading these units in struggle, criticism, and reform, the workers' propaganda teams have paid great attention to using Chairman Mao's proletarian policies on intellectuals, doing thorough and detailed ideological and political work, and mobilizing all positive factors. In various institutions of higher learning and secondary schools, the workers' propaganda teams, on the basis of fully affirming the great achievements of the revolutionary youngsters in the Cultural Revolution, have started from the perspective of cherishing the revolutionary youngsters, and have conducted warm and patient education and help for some youngsters who have made mistakes, enabling them to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and actively participate in the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units.

After a large number of outstanding workers from the industrial front were dispatched to various units of the superstructure, the broad masses of workers who remained at their production posts have, with even greater revolutionary enthusiasm, grasped revolution and promoted production, achieving outstanding results. In the past two months, the industrial front throughout the province has carried out struggle, criticism, and reform in a lively manner, and production has also presented a situation of daily and monthly progress. In September, the number of underground workers in coal mines reached a historical high, and coal production continued to increase. The province's steel production also increased month by month. In the light industry sector, the production of many important products such as paper, silkworm cocoons, cotton cloth, and sewing machines has increased significantly.

    工人阶级登上上层建筑政治舞台  广东全省斗、批、改出现崭新局面
    工人宣传队进驻上层建筑各个领域后，巩固和发展了革命大联合和三结合；大批知识分子走上与工农兵相结合的道路；革命大批判轰轰烈烈；生产不断上升
    据新华社广州十一日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示指引下，具有光荣革命传统的广东省工人阶级，派出大批以优秀产业工人为主体组成的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，登上上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台，有力地巩固和发展了全省大好的革命形势。许多基层单位在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，迅速建立起三结合的革命领导机构，全省实现了城乡上下一片红。一个声势浩大的斗、批、改高潮，正在全省各地掀起。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”八月中旬以来，广东省革命委员会和各级革命委员会，为了贯彻和落实毛主席这一最新指示，派出大批工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在人民解放军驻广州部队指战员的参加和支持下，开进教育、文艺、新闻、卫生等上层建筑各部门以及其他没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上层建筑各部门以后，有力地巩固和发展了全省的革命大联合和革命三结合。前段时间，全省各行政区、专区、县、市和人民公社就已经全部建立起革命委员会。最近，惠阳、佛山、梅县、海南、肇庆、湛江、韶关、汕头等全省八个行政区和专区的所有机关、学校、工厂等基层单位，也都建立起了革命三结合的领导机构。广州市百分之九十八以上的工厂企业都成立了革命委员会，其中铁路、交通、航运、电业、冶金、化工等十四个系统，从上到下实现了一片红。全省许多“老大难”单位，在工人宣传队进驻以后，迅速实现了革命三结合。中山大学、暨南大学、中山医学院等大专院校，过去由于阶级敌人破坏和资产阶级派性的干扰，两派群众组织长期对立，“内战”不休。工人宣传队进校后，用毛泽东思想武装革命师生，现在这些单位都已实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    工人宣传队进驻上层建筑各个领域后，把宣传和落实毛主席最新指示摆在头等重要的地位，坚持用战无不胜的毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育。他们在进驻的各单位普遍举办毛泽东思想学习班，大力发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，帮助知识分子克服理论脱离实际的坏作风，不断提高知识分子的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，增强他们对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的深厚感情，认真落实伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示。在工人们的教育下，全省有大批知识分子愉快地走上了和工农兵相结合的康庄大道。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队在各个单位里，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为指针，广泛发动群众，深入持久地开展革命大批判，迅速改变了一些单位的落后局面。工人宣传队引导这些单位的广大革命群众，把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍结合起来，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，同时深挖隐藏下来的一小撮阶级敌人。在领导这些单位斗、批、改的过程中，工人宣传队十分注意运用毛主席关于对待知识分子的各项无产阶级政策，深入细致地做好思想政治工作，调动一切积极因素。在各大专院校和中等学校，工人宣传队在充分肯定革命小将在文化大革命中的丰功伟绩的基础上，从爱护革命小将出发，对一些犯错误的革命小将进行了热情、耐心的教育和帮助，使他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极投入了本单位的斗、批、改。
    全省工业战线抽调大批优秀工人开进上层建筑各单位以后，留在生产岗位上的广大工人群众，以更大的革命干劲狠抓革命，猛促生产，创造出了优异的成绩。近两个月来，全省工业战线斗、批、改搞得热火朝天，生产也出现了日新月异的局面。九月份煤矿职工井下出勤的人数达到历史最高水平，煤炭产量连续上升。全省钢材产量也月月增加。轻工业方面，造纸、家蚕丝、棉布、缝纫机等许多重要产品的生产都大幅度增长。
