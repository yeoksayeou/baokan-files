Chairman Mao teaches us: “A Communist Party member should be open and aboveboard, loyal, and active, putting revolutionary interests first.” From the day a Communist Party member joins the Party, they should dedicate their life to the Party’s cause, and work for socialism and communism for the rest of their life.

China’s Khrushchev dares to oppose Chairman Mao and peddles decadent petty-bourgeois philosophy. He rants about how “thinking about personal interests all day long will ultimately not benefit personal interests, not considering personal interests will ultimately benefit personal interests, gaining small advantages leads to big losses, suffering small losses leads to big gains, this is in line with the Marxist-Leninist worldview.” This is an attempt to lure our Communist Party members into the trap of individualism, to follow him down the capitalist road. This is a gross slander against our Communist Party members, and we will not stand for it.

Communist Party members are public-minded, with only revolution on their minds. As long as it benefits the revolution, they fear no sacrifice of personal interests and should not calculate whether they can gain “advantages.” Is it to gain “big advantages” that Liu Hulan walked proudly to the executioner’s block, Li Wenzhong bravely rescued the Red Guards, Wang Jie and Meng He threw themselves onto the about-to-explode explosives…? At our station, there is an old worker named Xu Juda. When a train was about to hit a child, he fearlessly rushed onto the tracks, saved the child, and sacrificed his own life. Was this also to gain some “big advantage”? No, they thought of revolutionary interests, the Party’s interests, and the people’s interests, not personal interests.

If one were to follow China’s Khrushchev, considering in every matter whether they can gain big advantages, then it would be impossible to struggle for the communist cause to the end, and impossible to sacrifice personal interests for the revolutionary cause. Such people, when there are advantages to be gained, might put on a show of “revolution,” but when the critical moment comes, they will immediately reveal their true colors and become deserters in the revolutionary ranks. Isn’t China’s Khrushchev and his gang of lackeys exactly this way, betraying the Party and selling out the revolution, becoming a pile of filth despised by humanity?

Through this rectification campaign, we broad Party members have seen more clearly the reactionary nature of China’s Khrushchev. China’s Khrushchev tries to poison Communist Party members with the fallacy of “public and private interests merging,” which is utterly delusional. We must thoroughly criticize and expose this rotten, counter-revolutionary petty-bourgeois philosophy.

### 以革命利益为第一生命

    以革命利益为第一生命
    无锡站工人、革命委员会委员  李胜荣
    毛主席教导我们：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命”。共产党员从入党那天起，就要把自己的一生献给党的事业，为实现社会主义和共产主义干一辈子革命。
    中国赫鲁晓夫竟敢与毛主席唱反调，大肆贩卖腐朽的市侩哲学。他胡说什么“整天想到个人最后没有个人利益，不考虑个人则最后有个人利益，占小便宜，吃大亏，吃点小亏，占大便宜，这是合乎马列主义世界观的”。这是妄图引诱我们共产党员钻到个人主义的小圈子里，跟着他往资本主义道路上走。这是对我们共产党员的最大污蔑，我们决不答应。
    共产党员是姓“公”的，头脑里只有革命两字。只要有利于革命，就不怕牺牲个人的一切，决不应计较什么能不能占到“便宜”。难道刘胡兰昂首走向铡刀，李文忠英勇抢救红卫兵，王杰、门合扑向即将爆炸的炸药……，这些都是为了要占“大便宜”吗？我们站上有个老工人徐菊大，在火车将要撞到小孩的危险关头，奋不顾身地冲上轨道，救出小孩，最后牺牲了自己的生命。这难道也是为了捞个什么“大便宜”吗？不，他们想到的是革命利益、党的利益、人民的利益，而决不是个人。
    如果象中国赫鲁晓夫那样，事事处处都要考虑能不能占到大便宜，那就根本不可能为共产主义事业奋斗到底，根本不可能为革命事业牺牲个人。这种人，在有利可图时，也许会装出点“革命”的样子，但一到紧要关头，立刻会露出原形，成为革命队伍中的逃兵。中国赫鲁晓夫及其卵翼下的狐群狗党，不正是这样叛党自首、出卖革命，成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆吗？
    通过这次整党运动，我们广大党员对中国赫鲁晓夫的反动本质看得更清楚了。中国赫鲁晓夫想用“公私溶化”的谬论来毒害共产党员，完全是痴心妄想。我们一定要把他这一套腐烂的反革命市侩哲学批倒批臭。
