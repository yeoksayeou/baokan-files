The construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge has been a continuous struggle between two classes and two lines.

I was born into a working-class family. After liberation, I was nurtured by the Party and the people. In 1963, I graduated from Wuhan Bridge Engineering College and was assigned to the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge construction site for practical training. During this period, I gradually established a bond with the workers. However, the capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" on the bridge site stubbornly promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, using fame and wealth to corrupt the youth. In meetings and private conversations, they often said things like, "After three years as a technical assistant, you'll suffer a bit but can become an engineer," and "The Nanjing Bridge will promote a batch of engineers in the future, it all depends on your abilities." Under the sugar-coated bullets of the capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities," my thoughts began to change. I felt that staying on the site was "unpromising" and that I couldn't learn anything. Gradually, I started to work in isolation, collecting materials, and studying foreign texts, believing that only by becoming an engineer could I be considered capable and have a future.

When the bourgeoisie tried to drag me into the revisionist quagmire, the worker comrades, filled with proletarian feelings, often came to talk to me: "Little Zhou, why haven't we seen you on the construction site lately? You can't sit in the office for too long; otherwise, your tastes will differ from ours, and you might change." The worker comrades' sincere words hit the nail on the head, sounding the alarm for me. At that time, I re-read Chairman Mao's teachings: "Intellectuals must unite with the workers and peasants; otherwise, they will accomplish nothing." Chairman Mao's teachings gave me courage and strength, pointing out the direction for me to advance. Following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, I made up my mind to break free from the shackles of bourgeois fame and wealth, insisting on the path of uniting with the workers and peasants, rolling in the mud, getting oily, and forging a red heart. Although I was then transferred to the office, I tried to find time to go to the construction site, participate in labor, and learn from the worker comrades.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." This is an unshakable great truth. Intellectuals can only play their role by uniting with the workers and peasants; otherwise, they will accomplish nothing. The iron and road bridges of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge are very long, and the pile-driving task is extremely heavy. In the past, the pile-driving technology compiled from foreign materials, relying on closed-door frameworks, was severely detached from China's actual situation and could not solve problems. During construction, many difficulties arose, and the so-called "experts" and "authorities" pushed each other around, delaying the solution, which greatly affected the construction. After our pile foundation team arrived at the site, we worked with the worker comrades, based on the long-term pile-driving experience of the old workers, and under the guidance and help of the worker comrades, we summarized a set of effective pile-driving experiences, greatly improving work efficiency and creating good conditions for the successful completion of the massive pile foundation construction of the bridge.

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Most or many of the students trained in old schools can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some have made inventions and creations. However, they must be under the correct line leadership, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must re-educate them, thoroughly changing their old thoughts." Chairman Mao's brilliant directive is a long-term strategy for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, pointing out the direction for us to become revolutionary. In the process of participating in the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, to a certain extent, I have received some tempering and accepted some re-education from the working class. However, I must further thoroughly transform my worldview. I am determined, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to voluntarily accept the re-education of the working class, to be a lifelong student of the worker masses, and to temper myself into a steadfast proletarian revolutionary fighter.

    自觉地接受工人阶级的再教育
    南京长江大桥工地技术员　周咏阶
    南京长江大桥的建设过程，始终贯串着两个阶级、两条路线的斗争。
    我生长在一个劳动人民家庭，解放后受到党和人民的培养，一九六三年从武汉桥梁学院毕业后，分配到南京长江大桥工地实习。在实习过程中，我逐步和工人群众建立了感情。但是大桥的走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”，顽固地推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，竭力用名利地位来腐蚀青年。他们在实习生座谈会上和个别交谈中，常常胡说什么“熬过三年值班技术员，吃点苦头，就可以当工程师”，“南京大桥将来要提拔一批工程师，就看你们的本事了”。在走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”的糖衣炮弹袭击下，我的思想开始发生了变化，觉得老呆在现场“没出息”，学不到东西。于是渐渐闭门造车，收集资料，死啃外文，认为只有当上工程师，才算有本事，才有前途。
    当资产阶级想把我拉到修正主义泥坑里去的时候，工人同志们满怀着无产阶级的感情，经常找我谈心：“小周，这阵子怎么不见你到工地上来了？办公室不能坐久啊，这样下去，同我们工人的‘胃口’就不一样罗，当心变质……”工人同志们语重心长的话，一针见血刺中了我的要害，给我敲响了警钟。这时，我重温了毛主席的教导：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”毛主席的教导给了我勇气和力量，给我指出了前进的方向。我遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，下定决心冲破资产阶级名利思想的枷锁，坚持走与工农相结合的道路，滚一身泥巴，沾一身油污，炼出一颗红心。当时，我虽然调到科室工作，但尽量抽出时间到施工现场，参加劳动，向工人同志们学习。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。这是颠扑不破的伟大真理。知识分子只有和工农群众相结合，才能发挥自己的作用，否则必然一事无成。南京长江大桥铁路公路引桥很长，打桩的任务极其繁重。过去，闭门定框框靠外国资料编制的打桩工艺，严重脱离我国实际情况，不能解决问题，施工中碰到很多难关，而所谓“专家”、“权威”你推我，我推你，迟迟解决不了问题，给施工带来很大影响。我们引桥基桩小组到工地后，和工人同志一道劳动，根据老工人的长期打桩经验，在工人同志的帮助指导下，总结出了一套行之有效的打桩经验，大大提高了工作效率，为胜利地完成庞大的引桥基桩施工任务，创造了良好的条件。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。”毛主席的这一光辉指示，是反修防修的百年大计，给我们指明了革命化的方向。在参加南京长江大桥的建设过程中，在某种程度上，我虽然得到了一些锻炼，接受了工人阶级的一些再教育，但是，还必须进一步彻底改造世界观。我决心在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，自觉地接受工人阶级的再教育，当一辈子工人群众的小学生，把自己锻炼成为一名坚强的无产阶级革命战士。
