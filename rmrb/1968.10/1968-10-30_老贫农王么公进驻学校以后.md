Edition: 2

The 68-year-old poor peasant Wang Mopu from Wangjia Village, Mazhi Commune, Longli County, Guizhou Province, was entrusted by all the poor and lower-middle peasants of the commune to enter Mazhi Primary School.

Mazhi Primary School was a "persistent problem" unit in the commune, where internal conflicts had been ongoing for a long time. Some students, influenced by reactionary anarchist ideas, would come to school when they felt like it and leave when they didn't. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: This school is like a drum without a beat, how can it achieve educational revolution? How can it carry out the struggle-criticize-transform campaign?

Wang Mopu is illiterate, but he is filled with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, boundless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He came to Mazhi Primary School with a red heart. His first lesson at the school was to educate the revolutionary teachers and students to never forget class bitterness, to always remember blood debts, to never forget the Communist Party after liberation, and to never forget Chairman Mao after happiness. Wang Mopu raised his hand, which had been broken by a landlord, in the classroom and angrily denounced the counter-revolutionary fallacy of "exploitation has merit" by China's Khrushchev. The classroom echoed with the sustained cries of "Down with China's Khrushchev!" Wang Mopu then solemnly told the revolutionary teachers and students, "Countless martyrs have sacrificed themselves for the people's interests ahead of us." What faults and errors can we not give up? We must follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize for life.

After Wang Mopu came to the school, he strictly required himself to maintain the character of a poor peasant. Although he is so old, he cleaned the school's surroundings spotless. He also led the teachers and students to repair broken desks and chairs.

Wang Mopu particularly valued the participation of students and teachers in agricultural production. When he saw that the school's fields were full of rocks and trees, he led the revolutionary teachers and students to carry soil to turn the rocky land into arable land. Wang Mopu said: If we don't start teaching these children to labor from a young age, they will become lazier and lazier. Over time, they will turn from lazy to revisionist, and in the future, they will harm people.

Wang Mopu's actions of loyalty to Chairman Mao are a silent command to the revolutionary teachers and students. The entire school's revolutionary teachers and students, taking Wang Mopu as an example, fiercely struggled against their own selfish and impure thoughts, fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and were determined to carry out the educational revolution under the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They resolutely took actual actions to fight the struggle-criticize-transform campaign, let Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy the school's position, and turn the school into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

    老贫农王么公进驻学校以后
    贵州省龙里县麻芝公社王家院六十八岁的老贫农王么公，受公社全体贫下中农的委托，进驻麻芝小学。
    麻芝小学在公社是个“老大难”单位，长期“内战”不休。一部分学生受反动的无政府主义思潮的影响，高兴就来，不高兴就走。贫下中农说：这个学校锣齐鼓不齐，怎能实现教育革命？怎能搞好斗批改？
    王么公一字不识，但是他满怀着无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的红心，来到了麻芝小学。他到学校上的第一堂课，就是教育革命师生不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，翻身不忘共产党，幸福不忘毛主席。王么公在课堂上举起他的被地主打断的手，愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的反革命谬论，课堂上“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”的口号声经久不息。随后，王么公语重心长地对革命师生们说：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了”，我们自己还有什么缺点错误舍不得丢掉呢！我们一定要跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
    王么公到学校后，处处严格要求自己，保持贫下中农的本色。他年纪这样大，但是把学校周围环境打扫得一干二净。他还带领师生们把坏了的桌子板凳修好。
    王么公特别重视学生、教员参加农业生产的情况，当他看到学校种的地，尽是山树石块，便带领革命师生抬泥巴，把石地变成了土地。王么公说：这些娃娃不从小教他们锻炼劳动，就会越搞越懒，天长日久就会由懒变修，将来就会害死人。
    王么公忠于毛主席的行动，对革命师生是无声的命令。全校革命师生以王么公为榜样，狠斗自己头脑中的私心杂念，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，决心在贫下中农的领导下搞好教育革命，坚决以实际行动打好斗批改这一仗，让毛泽东思想永远占领学校的阵地，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
