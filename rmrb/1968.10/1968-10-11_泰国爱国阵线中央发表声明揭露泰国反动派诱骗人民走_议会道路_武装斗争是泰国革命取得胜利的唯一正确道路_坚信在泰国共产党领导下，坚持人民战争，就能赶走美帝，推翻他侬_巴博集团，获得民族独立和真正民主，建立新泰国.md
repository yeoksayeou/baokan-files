The Central Committee of the Thai Patriotic Front recently broadcasted via the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station that on September 20, the Central Committee of the Thai Patriotic Front issued a statement titled "Armed Struggle or Parliamentary Struggle?" The statement exposed how the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique fabricated a false constitution and false elections to deceive the people into taking the "parliamentary road." The statement called on Thai patriots to boycott the false elections, support the armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand, and resolutely take the path of armed struggle.

The statement said: "Since the Thanom-Kittikachorn sellout clique promulgated the false constitution, three months have passed. Our compatriots have now seen that there is no democracy in the false constitution. What the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique hopes to achieve is to use the false constitution and false parliament to cover up their own treacherous and dictatorial faces, and through the powers granted by the false constitution, extend the life of their military-police fascist dictatorship, making their position legal. Therefore, people of all strata continue to thoroughly expose, condemn, and oppose the false constitution and the upcoming false elections.

"Our people have long been living under the shackles of fascist dictatorship, and they yearn for democracy. But we want real democracy, not fake democracy. This means we must overthrow the Thanom-Kittikachorn dictatorship, draft a constitution that ensures the government belongs to the people, and establish a people's democratic government."

The statement said: "How can our people achieve independence and democracy? There is only one path, and that is the path of armed struggle. The peaceful struggle and parliamentary struggle paths used by the ruling class to deceive us are of no help in freeing us from the fate of being slaves."

The statement said: "Whether or not to hold elections and establish a parliament entirely depends on the interests of the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique. Therefore, the elections and parliament created by the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique are merely false elections and false parliament. For our people, all of this is meaningless.

"Moreover, the ruling class can play all sorts of despicable tricks, engage in corruption, and can also buy off parliamentarians. They can dissolve the parliament or use force to overthrow it when necessary.

"Thus, a parliament that does not belong to the people is merely a decoration of a fake democratic system. The oppressed and exploited classes successfully overthrowing the ruling class's government through the parliament has never happened in the history of the parliamentary system. Especially in a country like Thailand, which has long been under fascist dictatorship, it is extremely rare for some factions within the ruling class to overthrow a government through the parliament. It is impossible for the broad masses of oppressed people to overthrow the ruling class through the parliament; they must rely on the power of armed struggle. This is in line with Chairman Mao Zedong's teaching that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'

"Patriotic compatriots, having understood this theory, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, have taken up arms to bravely fight against the U.S.-Thanom clique. The past three years have proven that the path indicated by the Communist Party of Thailand is the correct path. This path is: we should rely on the peasants, wage guerrilla warfare, establish rural base areas, use the countryside to encircle the cities, and ultimately seize national power. Our people's armed struggle, like a spark, has rapidly spread to all four regions of the country. The people's armed forces, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have grown from small to large, from weak to strong, and have achieved victory after victory. The enemy's paper tiger has been exposed, and they are everywhere on the defensive, in a very difficult situation, unable to advance or retreat. Therefore, they have to use political deception, promulgate a false constitution, and prepare to hold a fake election to deceive the people. They seem to have reformed, abandoned their true fascist and dictatorial nature, and implemented democracy. They attempt to lure patriotic compatriots into their trap, lay down their arms, stop fighting, and place their hopes on parliamentary struggle.

"But the U.S.-Thanom clique has misjudged the situation. The vast majority of the Thai people have seen through their true nature. All the armed forces are even more tightly gripping their guns and more fiercely attacking the enemy. During this period, the vast majority of the people have boycotted the elections and refused to participate in the provincial and municipal elections, including the Bangkok-Thonburi municipal elections. The number of people participating in the elections only accounts for 5% to 20% of the total. This boycott of the elections has made the Thanom-Kittikachorn government very worried. If the ruling class truly holds elections, we believe that patriotic compatriots will boycott them even more broadly. We call on patriotic democrats from various political groups who care about their reputation to cooperate with the masses to boycott the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique's false elections and refuse to participate in election activities. If they participate in election activities, it is tantamount to supporting the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique's deception and undermining the democratic and revolutionary cause of national salvation. At present, the best way to resolutely boycott the elections and thoroughly expose and condemn the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique's political deception is to support the path of armed struggle and help the people's armed struggle."

The statement said: "It is well known that the Thai Patriotic Front is an organization composed of people from various strata and regions. Its purpose is to complete the greatest revolutionary task of the contemporary era, which is: to drive the U.S. imperialists out of Thailand, overthrow the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique, strive for national independence and true democracy, and build a prosperous, strong, and new Thailand. To achieve this goal, the Thai Patriotic Front will cooperate with all patriotic and democratic parties, groups, and individuals, resolutely support or participate in the armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand."

The statement finally said: "We call on all compatriots to unite as one, support the armed struggle, and from all fronts and all fields launch attacks on the enemy, and more broadly carry out the people's war. We face many difficulties and hardships, and the road ahead is tortuous, but we firmly believe that under the brilliant leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, as long as we persist in the people's war, the final victory will definitely belong to the Thai people."

    泰国爱国阵线中央发表声明揭露泰国反动派诱骗人民走“议会道路”
    武装斗争是泰国革命取得胜利的唯一正确道路
    坚信在泰国共产党领导下，坚持人民战争，就能赶走美帝，推翻他侬—巴博集团，获得民族独立和真正民主，建立新泰国
    新华社十日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台最近广播，泰国爱国阵线中央委员会九月二十日发表了题目是《武装斗争还是议会斗争？》的声明，揭露泰国他侬—巴博集团制造伪宪法和伪选举来诱骗人民走“议会道路”。声明号召泰国爱国人士抵制伪选举，支持泰国共产党领导下的人民武装斗争，坚决走武装斗争的道路。
    声明说：“自从他侬—巴博卖国集团颁布伪宪法以来，已经过去三个月了。我国同胞现在已经看清，在伪宪法中没有民主。他侬—巴博集团所希望的，是利用伪宪法和伪议会，来掩盖他们自己卖国的、独裁的面目，并通过伪宪法赋予他们的权利，延长他们的军事警察法西斯独裁政权的寿命，使其地位合法化。因此，各阶层人民继续起来彻底揭露、谴责和反对伪宪法和行将举行的伪选举。
    “我国人民一直生活在法西斯专政的桎梏下面，他们十分渴望得到民主。但是，我们要的是真正的民主，而不是假民主。这就是说，我们要推翻他侬—巴博专制政权，制定一个确保政权属于人民的宪法，建立一个人民民主政府。”
    声明说：“我国人民怎样才能得到独立和民主呢？只有一条道路，这就是武装斗争的道路。统治阶级用来欺骗我们的和平斗争的道路和议会斗争的道路，无助于我们摆脱当奴隶的命运。”
    声明说：“要不要举行大选和成立议会，这完全取决于他侬—巴博集团的利益。因此，他侬—巴博集团一手制造的大选和议会，只不过是伪大选和伪议会。对我国人民来说，这一切都是毫无意义的。
    “此外，统治阶级可以玩弄种种卑鄙的阴谋诡计，营私舞弊，也可以收买议员。他们在必要时可以行使解散议会的权利或者用武力推翻议会。
    “由此可见，不属于人民的议会只不过是假民主制度的装饰品。象被压迫和被剥削阶级通过议会成功地推翻统治阶级的政权这种事情，在议会制度的整个历史中是从来没有过的。特别是在象泰国这样一个长期处在法西斯独裁统治下的国家里，统治阶级内部的一些集团通过议会推翻一个政权，这是非常少有的事情。广大受压迫的人民群众要通过议会推翻统治阶级是绝不可能的，他们必须依靠武装斗争的力量。这是符合毛泽东主席关于‘枪杆子里面出政权’的教导的。
    “爱国的同胞们由于领会了这一理论，在泰国共产党的正确领导下，纷纷拿起武器来同美国—他侬集团进行了英勇的战斗。三年来的事实证明，泰国共产党指出的道路是一条正确的道路。这条道路就是：我们应该依靠农民，进行游击战，建立农村根据地，用乡村包围城市，最后夺取全国的政权。我国人民的武装斗争，象星星之火，迅速蔓延到全国的四个区域。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的人民武装力量，由小到大，由弱到强，不断发展，并且取得了一个又一个的胜利。敌人的纸老虎原形暴露无遗。他们到处挨打，处境十分困难，进退不得。因此，他们不得不使用政治骗局，颁布伪宪法，准备举行一次假大选，来欺骗人民。他们这样做，仿佛他们已经改邪归正，抛弃了他们的真正的法西斯和独裁本质，实行民主。他们企图用这种办法来引诱爱国同胞上他们的圈套，放下武器，停止战斗，把希望寄托在议会斗争上。
    “但是，美国—他侬集团错误地估计了形势。绝大多数的泰国人民认清了他们的本质。所有的人民武装都在更加紧握手中枪，更加猛烈地袭击敌人。在此期间，绝大多数人民都抵制选举，在各地拒绝参加府议会和市议会的选举，包括曼谷—吞武里市议会的选举。参加选举的人数只占总人数的百分之五到百分之二十。这种抵制选举的斗争，使得他侬—巴博政府非常忧虑不安。如果统治阶级真正举行大选，我们相信，爱国同胞一定会更加广泛地加以抵制。我们号召爱护他们的名声的各个政治集团的爱国民主人士同人民群众合作，一起来抵制他侬—巴博集团的伪大选，拒绝参加竞选活动。如果参加竞选活动，就无异于支持他侬—巴博集团的骗局，破坏民主的和革命的救国事业。目前，坚决抵制大选，彻底揭露和谴责他侬—巴博集团的政治骗局的最好的表示，是支持武装斗争的道路和帮助人民武装斗争。”
    声明说：“众所周知，泰国爱国阵线是由各阶层人士和各个地区的力量组成的一个爱国组织。它的目的是完成当代最伟大的革命任务，就是：把美帝国主义赶出泰国，推翻他侬—巴博集团，争取民族独立和真正的民主，建立一个繁荣的、强大的和新的泰国。为了实现这一目标，泰国爱国阵线将同一切爱国的和民主的党派、集团和个人合作，坚决支持或参加泰国共产党领导的武装斗争。”
    声明最后说：“我们号召所有同胞象一个人一样地团结起来，支持武装斗争，从各个战线上和从各个领域向敌人发动进攻，更加广泛地开展人民战争。我们面临着许多艰难困苦，前进的道路是曲折的，但是，我们仍然坚决相信，在泰国共产党的光辉领导下，只要我们坚持人民战争，最后胜利一定是属于泰国人民的。”
