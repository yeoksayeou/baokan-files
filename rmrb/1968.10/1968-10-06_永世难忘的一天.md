An Unforgettable Day
Worker Wu Zijun of Factory 3516

October 1st is a day I will never forget. In my heart, it is the most brilliant and radiant day. Nineteen years ago on this day, our great leader Chairman Mao, representing the working class, proclaimed the founding of New China from Tiananmen. From that day on, I have always hoped to see our great leader Chairman Mao. My long-cherished wish has finally come true! This year on October 1st, I, representing the revolutionary workers of my factory, attended the National Day celebration and saw our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin. When I saw our great leader Chairman Mao, radiant and stepping onto Tiananmen Gate with vigor, my heart pounded with excitement, and tears of joy streamed down my face. I couldn't help but shout loudly, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

During the celebration, I listened to Vice Commander Lin deliver the new battle call from the headquarters of the proletarian revolution, led by Chairman Mao, in the new situation. Vice Chairman Lin's speech was excellent, truly excellent! We firmly support it and will definitely carry it out. We will follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments step by step, and carry out his latest instructions thoroughly and comprehensively. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will strike!

As soon as Chairman Mao issued his latest instruction on "carrying out the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary for the working class to lead, for the working masses to participate, and to cooperate with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, together with the active elements in schools who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, to form a revolutionary triad. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, and forever lead the schools," the entire factory was in an uproar. The revolutionary workers believed that this was Chairman Mao's greatest concern, trust, encouragement, and exhortation for the working class. An old worker excitedly said: The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents slandered us, saying we could only wield hammers and provide labor. Chairman Mao thinks so highly of us, asking us to wield the pen, manage state affairs, lead everything, not only enter schools but also forever lead schools. This is unprecedented. Chairman Mao supports us, and we will make Chairman Mao proud. We must wield the pen well and manage the pen well. The factory has heavy tasks, tight schedules, and few hands, but comrades all say: The schedule is tight, but we cannot relax in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments; there are few hands, but we cannot omit even a single detail in carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. No matter how heavy the production tasks are, we will definitely overfulfill them. We quickly selected a batch of outstanding workers from various workshops to form the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and marched into places where intellectuals were concentrated and units where "old and difficult" problems had not been solved.

The Shanghai New China Printing Factory we entered was originally a small factory merged from American, British, and Japanese imperialists. After liberation, the imperialists were kicked out, but their poisonous roots remained deeply entrenched. A handful of traitors, spies, and capitalist roaders colluded with each other, controlling the printing power, printing anti-revolutionary books instead of Chairman Mao's works, and printing large quantities of black literature like "Self-Cultivation" and other poisonous weeds. During the Cultural Revolution, these elements colluded to sabotage and incite people to fight against each other, attempting to obstruct the implementation and realization of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Holding study classes is Chairman Mao's great instruction, but this place had never held any study classes. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, our workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team closely united with the revolutionary masses, fought together, and was determined to blow open the lid of class struggle and expose the black hands. As soon as we entered the factory, we rooted ourselves among the masses, blended with the printing workers, conducted in-depth investigations, and held the first Mao Zedong Thought study class, using the radiant Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate the broad masses of intellectuals. Through holding study classes, the broad masses of intellectuals awakened one after another, consciously engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism, and strived to eliminate the poison of the revisionist line.

In the future, we will definitely use Chairman Mao's affectionate reception as a great driving force, firmly occupy the political stage of the superstructure, use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, and transform everything according to the proletarian image, dyeing every domain of the superstructure red and golden with Mao Zedong Thought.

    永世难忘的一天
    三五一六工厂工人　吴子君
    十月一日，是我永世难忘的一天。这一天，在我心目中是最光辉、最灿烂的一天。十九年前的这一天，我们的伟大领袖毛主席在天安门上代表我们工人阶级宣告了新中国成立。打这一天起，我就时时刻刻在盼望着见到我们伟大领袖毛主席。多年的愿望终于实现了！今年十月一日，我代表我厂革命职工参加国庆观礼，见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席。当我看到我们的伟大领袖毛主席红光满面，健步登上天安门城楼时，心里激动得崩崩跳，幸福的眼泪止不住地流，我禁不住热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    在庆祝大会上，我聆听了林副统帅代表以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出的在新形势下的新的战斗号令。林副主席的讲话好得很，好极了！我们坚决拥护，坚决执行。毛主席的伟大战略部署，我们步步紧跟，毛主席的最新指示，我们彻底照办，全面落实。毛主席指到那里，我们就打到那里！
    毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校”的最新指示一发出，全厂立即沸腾了。广大革命职工认为，这是毛主席对我们工人阶级的最大关怀、最大信任、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策。一位老工人激动地说：中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人诬蔑我们只能掌锤把子，出牛力。毛主席他老人家这样看得起我们，要我们掌印把子，管国家大事，领导一切，不但进学校，而且永远领导学校，这是开天辟地第一回。毛主席为我们撑腰，我们为毛主席争气，一定要掌好印把子，管好笔杆子。厂里任务重，时间紧，人手少，但是同志们都说：时间紧，跟毛主席的伟大战略部署不能松；人手少，执行毛主席的最新指示一丝一毫不能少。有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，生产任务再重也要超额完成。我们很快地从各车间抽调了一批优秀工人，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，开进知识分子成堆的地方和“老大难”问题没解决的单位。
    我们进驻的上海新华印刷厂，原是美、英、日帝国主义开办的小厂合并而成的。解放后，帝国主义者滚蛋了，但他们的毒根还深深地残留着。一小撮叛徒、特务和走资派狼狈为奸，掌握了印刷大权，不印革命宝书毛主席著作，却大印黑《修养》和其他毒草。文化大革命中，这些家伙串通一气，大肆破坏，挑动群众斗群众，企图阻挠毛主席最新指示的贯彻和落实。办学习班是毛主席的伟大指示，可是这里从来没有办过学习班。我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队遵照毛主席的教导，和革命群众紧密团结在一起，战斗在一起，决心炸开阶级斗争的盖子，揪出黑手。一进厂，就扎根于群众之中，和印刷工人打成一片，深入调查研究，办起了第一期毛泽东思想学习班，以金灿灿的毛泽东思想对广大知识分子进行再教育。通过办学习班，广大知识分子纷纷觉悟，自觉地斗私批修，努力肃清修正主义路线的流毒。
    今后，我们一定以毛主席的亲切接见为巨大动力，牢牢地占领上层建筑的政治舞台，以毛泽东思想为指针，按照无产阶级的面貌改造一切，把上层建筑的各个领域用毛泽东思想染得红彤彤，金灿灿。
