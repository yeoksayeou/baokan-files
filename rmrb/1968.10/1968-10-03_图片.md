Revolutionary model operas, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, fully demonstrate the glorious achievements of our revolutionary cultural workers under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing in implementing and carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for literature and art. The revolutionary modern Beijing operas, revolutionary modern ballets, and revolutionary symphonic music that have appeared on the eastern horizon are the products of a thorough repudiation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line for literature and art and a thorough establishment of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for literature and art.

    闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命样板戏，充分显示了我国革命文艺战士在江青同志的率领下，贯彻执行毛主席革命文艺路线的辉煌成果。在东方地平线上出现的革命现代京剧、革命现代芭蕾舞剧和革命交响音乐，是大破反革命修正主义文艺路线、大立毛主席的革命文艺路线的产物。　　　　　　　　本版照片是首都国庆摄影报道组摄
