The worldview of the working class

Beijing Railway Bureau Fengtai Locomotive Section worker Gué Chéng Ēn

In "The Red Lantern," Li Yuhe and Qu Shan have the following dialogue:

Qu Shan: In fact, the highest faith can be summed up in just two characters.

Li Yuhe: Two characters? Which two characters?

Qu Shan: "For oneself."

Li Yuhe: Oh, "for you"?

Qu Shan: No, "for oneself."

Qu Shan then says, "If one does not act for oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth." This is the "trick" to being a person.

The "for oneself" philosophy that Qu Shan promotes in this dialogue is a pure and unadulterated bourgeois worldview, the "highest faith" and the "trick" to being a person for all exploiting classes. This worldview, for us workers, is as Li Yuhe says: "It's like blowing fire with a rolling pin—completely incomprehensible."

The worldview of the working class is fundamentally opposed to the bourgeois worldview. The bourgeois worldview is "for oneself," "if one does not act for oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth"; the worldview of the working class is "for the public," "completely selfless and dedicated to others."

The words and deeds of the working-class hero Li Yuhe shine with the brilliance of the working-class worldview. For the revolution, he "marches forward unyieldingly"; for the revolution, he "fights the enemy relentlessly"; for the revolution, he "is not afraid to sit in prison until the end"; for the revolution, he "is willing to be torn to pieces." In a word, he is completely "for the public," "completely selfless and dedicated to others."

The scene "Li Yuhe Attends the Banquet and Fights Qu Shan" is a clash between two worldviews. In this clash, Li Yuhe stands his ground, unyielding, using the noble working-class worldview to deeply expose and criticize the ugly bourgeois worldview!

    工人阶级的世界观
    北京铁路局丰台机务段工人　郜承恩
    在《红灯记》中，李玉和和鸠山有这样一段对话——
    鸠山：其实，最高的信仰，只用两个字便可以包括。
    李玉和：两个字，两个什么字？
    鸠山：“为我”。
    李玉和：哦，“为你”？
    鸠山：不！“为自己”。
    鸠山接着又说，“人不为己，天诛地灭”是做人的“诀窍”。
    鸠山在这段对话中所宣扬的“为我”哲学，是地地道道的资产阶级世界观，是一切剥削阶级“最高的信仰”和做人的“诀窍”。这种世界观，对我们工人阶级来说，正如李玉和所讲的：“真好比擀面杖吹火，一窍不通。”
    工人阶级的世界观同资产阶级的世界观是根本对立的。资产阶级的世界观是“为我”，是“人不为己，天诛地灭”；工人阶级的世界观是“为公”，是“毫不利己专门利人”。
    工人阶级英雄人物李玉和的一言一行，闪耀着工人阶级世界观的光辉。为革命，他“前仆后继走向前”；为革命，他“不屈不挠斗敌顽”；为革命，他“不怕把牢底来坐穿”；为革命，他“粉身碎骨也心甘”。一句话，就是：一心“为公”，“毫不利己专门利人”。
    李玉和“赴宴斗鸠山”这场戏，是两种世界观短兵相接的搏斗。在这场搏斗中，李玉和针锋相对，寸步不让，以崇高的工人阶级世界观，深刻地揭露和批判了丑恶的资产阶级世界观！
