The U.S. imperialists are currently intensifying their cultural aggression and infiltration activities in Brazil, further indoctrinating the younger generation with colonialist and subjugating education. The cultural "aid" agreement signed between Brazil's Ministry of Education and Culture and the U.S. Agency for International Development is a typical example of cultural aggression. According to this agreement, the U.S. will "assist" Brazil in "reforming" its universities and send American "advisors" to various levels of Brazilian schools. Under the guise of cultural "aid," the U.S. aims to fully control Brazil's educational front, poisoning the minds of youth.

In addition, U.S. imperialists are brazenly engaging in large-scale land purchases, seizures, and military occupations in Brazil. It has been revealed that the Pentagon is attempting to "internationalize" the Amazon basin, located in the heart of South America, to establish a new base. This would better facilitate the U.S. in suppressing revolutionary movements across Latin American countries.

    美帝加紧对巴西进行文化侵略
    美帝国主义目前正在加紧对巴西进行文化侵略和渗透活动，对青年一代进一步灌输殖民主义奴化教育。巴西文教部与美国国际开发署签订的所谓文化“援助”协定是典型的文化侵略协定。根据这项协定，美国要“资助”巴西进行大学“改革”，向巴西各级学校派遣美国
  “顾问”，以便在文化“援助”的幌子下全面控制巴西的教育阵地，毒化青少年的心灵。
    除此以外，美帝国主义者还在巴西肆无忌惮地进行大量收买、霸占土地和军事占领的罪恶活动。据揭露，目前五角大楼正企图把位于南美中心地带的亚马孙流域实行“国际化”，搞一个新的基地，以更利于美国镇压拉丁美洲各国人民的革命运动。　（据新华社讯）
