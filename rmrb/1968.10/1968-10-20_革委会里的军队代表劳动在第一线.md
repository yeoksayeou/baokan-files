In the Fushun Cement Factory, when people talk about the Revolutionary Committee Chairman and military representative Comrade Yu Zengliang, the workers all say in unison: "Old Yu is truly our good chairman, good propaganda team leader, and good office worker."

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at a time when the two classes, two lines, and two roads were in fierce struggle, Comrade Yu Zengliang led the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to the Fushun Cement Factory. He fought shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary workers as an ordinary soldier. After becoming the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, he often worked alongside the workers as an ordinary worker. He often said:

"Labor is a great classroom for transforming and educating people. If you frequently hold a hammer and touch a shovel, your hands won't become soft, and your thoughts won't deteriorate." He regarded participating in labor as a practical action to be loyal to Chairman Mao and as the fundamental path to prevent revisionism and achieve ideological transformation.

One notable feature of Comrade Yu Zengliang's participation in labor is that he takes the lead in doing dirty, hard, and dangerous work.

Once, Yu Zengliang went to the calcination workshop to work in the coal transportation trench. The environment there was quite harsh. After working for a while, his leg, which suffered from arthritis, felt cold. He looked at the workers wearing rubber boots and working in the damp area and asked, "Don't your legs feel cold?" The workers said, "They are a bit cold." Yu Zengliang then asked, "Why don't you propose to the Revolutionary Committee to find a solution?" The workers said, "The Revolutionary Committee was just established, and there are many problems to solve in the revolution and production. This small difficulty can be overcome. We should let the Revolutionary Committee focus on leading the entire factory to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation." Yu Zengliang was deeply moved. He thought: Revolutionary workers have a broad vision and are selfless, like old yellow oxen for the revolution, giving much to the people and asking little from the people. I must take the workers as my example and be a good servant of the people. After returning from labor, to prevent workers from getting arthritis, he immediately discussed with the Revolutionary Committee members and decided to make a pair of felt boots and knee pads for each worker in the trench.

After receiving the boots and knee pads, the workers were excited and immediately sang praises to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, praising the Revolutionary Committee and commending the Revolutionary Committee members and the masses for their close hearts. The more the workers praised, the more Yu Zengliang felt ashamed, thinking: Why didn't we discover and solve the workers' hardships sooner? He compared himself with the workers' noble qualities, traced the root causes, and realized that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, he had spent more time in the office, his legs were not as active, and his thoughts had become lazy. If he had gone to the trench to work earlier and more frequently, this problem would have been solved long ago! From then on, he often went to the most difficult places to work, tempering his revolutionary will and deeply planting the roots of being a servant of the people.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "A large number of cadres going down to labor is a good opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." Comrade Yu Zengliang, combining his own practice, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and felt deeply moved. To quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, he led the Revolutionary Committee members to the labor site, studying and working together, and re-examined and supplemented the original decision of the Revolutionary Committee that cadres should frequently participate in labor. Comrade Yu Zengliang is determined to forever follow the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao, forever maintaining revolutionary youth.

"The New Worker" in the Mine

On the evening of October 4, as soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres going down to labor were broadcast, the Five Dragons Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau was in an uproar. The chairman of the Mining Bureau Revolutionary Committee and military representative, Comrade Zhang Jiankui, brought the freshly printed latest instructions from Chairman Mao to the mine and handed them out one by one to the miners. Chairman Mao's latest instructions shone like a red sun in the mine, illuminating everyone's hearts. Amidst the cheers, Comrade Zhang Jiankui read aloud with everyone: "A large number of cadres going down to labor is a good opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." After studying the latest instructions, he picked up a large iron shovel and worked enthusiastically with the workers.

That evening, Comrade Zhang Jiankui was particularly excited. He reviewed his work since coming to the Mining Bureau and deeply felt that Chairman Mao's latest instructions had pointed out a bright path for cadres to achieve ideological transformation.

As early as April this year, when the Revolutionary Committee of the Fuxin Mining Bureau was just established, Comrade Zhang Jiankui considered implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to link up with the masses" and believed that he must first place himself among the masses and be an ordinary laborer. Thus, he led the office cadres to work in the mine. Once, he went to the Five Dragons Mine to work. After working for a while, the workers only then noticed an additional new miner. Everyone whispered while working: "Where did this old man come from? He works so hard!" Some said, "He looks familiar, I think I've seen him somewhere." Comrade Zhang Jiankui was already panting and sweating profusely. A worker next to him warmly greeted him, "Old comrade! Rest a bit!" Comrade Zhang Jiankui felt warm in his heart and deeply felt the workers' deep class feelings. He thought: Everyone doesn't recognize me, which shows I still have some official airs and haven't gone deep enough among the masses; the workers let me rest, which shows I participate in labor less and don't work with the spirit of a worker. This is not only a difference in operational technology but also a gap in ideological transformation. He resolved to learn anew in labor, constantly transform his thoughts, and thoroughly eliminate official airs.

After resting, Comrade Zhang Jiankui chatted with the workers, from the class struggle in the coal mine to the life of the miners. When the office cadres who went down with him introduced him as the chairman of the Bureau Revolutionary Committee to the workers, dozens of miners' lamps shone on his face covered with coal dust, and dozens of workers gathered around him, holding Comrade Zhang Jiankui's hand and saying, "You are truly a good cadre for us miners, just like us miners, no wonder we didn't recognize you." After ascending from the mine, the workers saw Comrade Zhang Jiankui showering with them and said, "Comrade Zhang, there's a small shower room over there." He replied, "No! I shower with you, not only to wash off the sweat on my body but also to wash off the official airs." While showering, the workers saw that he had several large scars on his body, and some comrades concernedly said, "Comrade Zhang, you are old and not in good health, you should work less and put more effort into leadership in the future." Comrade Zhang Jiankui said, "Young people need to transform their thoughts in labor, and old cadres also need to learn anew in labor. I am a child from a poor family, since the Red Army period, I have followed Chairman Mao in revolution. Now that my position is high, but the spirit of an ordinary soldier cannot change, the spirit of the working people cannot be lost, and the steps following Chairman Mao cannot be slow."

A Good Cadre Who Maintains Revolutionary Character

Comrade Yang Qian, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee and military representative of the Liaoning Haicheng Silk Factory, is a cadre from the period of the War of Liberation. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, he firmly remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor," and no matter how busy the work was, how heavy the tasks were, or how tight the time was, he insisted on going deep into the workshops to work shoulder to shoulder with the workers, getting covered in oil stains. He consciously regarded participating in labor as a bond to closely link with the masses, an opportunity to learn from the workers, and a necessary path to achieve ideological transformation.

One day, he came to the cotton machine and prepared to work with the workers. This was the dirtiest and hardest work in the entire factory. After starting work, the machine wheels spun, and the cocoon juice splashed, emitting an unpleasant odor. Yang Qian felt a bit uncomfortable. But the workers were working vigorously. At this moment, he thought: Why aren't the workers afraid of dirt and hard work? It's because they have a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and they consciously regard the production post as a battlefield to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He then thought of his past, in the days of fierce battles, following the great leader Chairman Mao in southward and northward campaigns, fighting and living with the soldiers, and working with them. At that time, there was not the slightest thought of being afraid of dirt and hard work, but now why did this thought of being afraid of dirt and hard work arise? It's because after the revolution's victory, he didn't grasp the ideological transformation tightly and was influenced by bourgeois ideology. If this continued, he would go astray. Thus, Comrade Yang Qian exposed his active thoughts to the masses and asked everyone for help. Afterward, he went to the dirtiest places and worked in the hardest places.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "A large number of cadres going down to labor is a good opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." Comrade Yang Qian studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and was greatly inspired and educated, with more confidence and greater enthusiasm. He insisted on working and fighting with the workers in the most complex places of class struggle. The workers affectionately praised him as a "good cadre who maintains revolutionary character."

    革委会里的军队代表劳动在第一线
    老于是咱们的好主任
    在抚顺水泥厂，提起革委会主任、军队代表于增良同志，工人群众都异口同声地说：“老于呀，可真是咱们的好主任，好宣传队长，好办事员。”
    于增良同志在无产阶级文化大革命中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的时刻，带领毛泽东思想宣传队，来到了抚顺水泥厂。他和革命工人并肩战斗在一起，是普通战士；当了革委会主任以后，他经常和工人群众劳动在一起，是普通工人。他常说：
  “劳动是改造人、教育人的大课堂。锤把经常拿，锹把经常摸，手才不会变细，思想才不会变质。”他把参加劳动，看成是忠于毛主席的实际行动，是反修防修，实现思想革命化的根本途径。
    于增良同志参加劳动的一个显著特点就是，遇到脏活走在前，遇到累活干在前，遇到险活抢在前。
    一次，于增良到烧成车间运煤地沟去劳动。这里环境比较艰苦。他干了一会儿，患有关节炎的腿就觉得发凉。他看看工人同志们穿着胶皮水靴，在潮湿地方干活，就问：“你们腿不凉吗？”工人同志说：“是有些凉。”于增良接着又问：“那你们怎么不向革委会提出来想法解决呢？”工人们说，革委会成立不久，革命、生产上需要解决的问题很多，这点困难我们能克服，应该让革委会集中精力领导全厂落实好毛主席的最新指示，搞好斗、批、改。于增良听了，很受感动。他想：革命工人胸怀全局，一心为公，甘当革命的老黄牛，给予人民的甚多，要求人民的甚少，自己一定要以工人同志为榜样，当好人民勤务员。劳动回来后，为了防止工人得关节炎，他马上和革委会成员研究，决定给在地沟工作的每个工人制做一双胶皮毡靴和一副护膝。
    工人同志领到了毡靴和护膝以后，激动地当场歌颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，赞扬了革命委员会好，表扬革委会成员和群众心贴心。工人越是表扬，于增良心里越是惭愧，琢磨：我们对工人的疾苦，为什么迟迟没有发现，迟迟没有解决呢？他对照工人群众的高尚品质，追根求源，察觉到自己在革委会成立以后，坐办公室时间还是多了，腿不那么勤了，思想有些懒了。如果自己到地沟里劳动再早一些，经常一些，这个问题不早就解决了吗！打这以后，经常到最艰苦的地方去劳动，磨炼自己的革命意志，深扎甘当人民勤务员的思想根子。
    毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”于增良同志结合自己的实践，反复学习毛主席这一最新指示，倍感亲切。为了迅速落实毛主席的最新指示，他带领革委会成员，到劳动现场，边学习、边劳动，对革委会原来作出的干部要经常参加劳动的决定，重新进行了研究和补充。于增良同志决心永远沿着毛主席指引的光辉道路阔步前进，永葆革命青春。
    矿井里的“新工人”
    十月四日晚，毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示刚一广播，阜新矿务局五龙矿井下就沸腾起来了。矿务局革委会主任、军队代表张建奎同志，带着刚刚打印出来的毛主席的最新指示来到井下，一张一张递到矿工手里。毛主席的最新指示象一轮红日在矿井里升起，照得大家心里亮堂堂。在一片欢呼声中，张建奎同志跟大家一齐高声朗读：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”学完最新指示，他就抡起大铁锹，和工人们热火朝天地干起来。
    这天晚上，张建奎同志心里特别激动，他回顾了到矿务局以来的工作，深深体会到毛主席这一最新指示，给干部实现思想革命化指出了一条光明大道。
    还在今年四月间，阜新矿务局革委会刚刚成立的时候，张建奎同志考虑到要落实毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的指示，认为必须首先把自己摆到群众之中，当一个普通的劳动者。于是，他就带领机关干部下井劳动。有一次，他到五龙矿劳动，干了一阵以后，工人们才发现多了一个新矿工。大家边干边小声议论说：“那儿来的个老头？干的还挺起劲呢！”有的说：“怪面熟的，好象在哪儿见过。”张建奎同志早已气喘吁吁汗流浃背了。旁边的一个工人亲热地招呼道：“老同志！你休息一下吧！”张建奎同志心里热呼呼的，深深感到工人同志的阶级感情最深。他想：大家不认识我，这说明我还有官气，深入群众不够；工人让我休息，这说明我参加劳动少，干活还不带个工人的劲儿。这不仅是作业技术上的差异，而是思想改造上的差距，他下定决心在劳动中重新学习，不断改造思想，彻底打掉官气。
    休息了，张建奎同志和工人们促膝谈心，从煤矿的阶级斗争谈到矿工的生活。当跟他一起下井的机关干部向工人介绍他是局革委会主任时，几十盏矿灯的灯光一起照向他那沾满煤灰的脸，几十名工人一起围拢过来，握着张建奎同志的手说：“你可真是咱矿工的好干部，和咱矿工一模一样，难怪我们认不出来。”升井后，工人们见张建奎同志和他们一起进澡堂，就说：“张主任，那边还有个小澡堂。”他回答说：“不！我和你们在一起洗澡，不仅能洗掉身上的臭汗，还能洗掉官气。”洗澡时，工人们见他身上有好几块大伤疤，有的同志关切地说：“张主任，你年岁大了，身体又不太好，今后少干点活，多在领导上使点劲就行了。”张建奎同志说：“青年人要在劳动中改造思想，老干部也要在劳动中重新受教育。我是个穷人家的孩子，从红军时期起，就跟毛主席干革命。现在职位高了，可是普通一兵的本色不能变，劳动人民的本色不能丢，紧跟毛主席的步子不能慢。”
    永葆革命本色的好干部
    辽宁海城丝绸厂革委会主任、军队代表杨迁同志是解放战争时期的干部。革命委员会成立后，他牢记伟大领袖毛主席关于“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度”的教导，不论工作多忙，任务多重，时间多紧，都坚持深入车间同工人们一起并肩劳动，沾一身油污。他自觉地把参加劳动看做是密切联系群众的纽带，向工人学习的好机会，实现思想革命化的必由之路。
    一天，他来到打棉机旁，准备和工人一起干，这是全厂最脏最累的活。劳动开始后，机轮飞转，蛹浆四溅，发出一种难闻的气味，杨迁感到有点不大习惯。而工人们却是生龙活虎般地干着。这时，他想：为什么工人不怕脏不怕累呢？就是因为他们有一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，他们自觉地把生产岗位当作捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战场。他又联想到自己的过去，在炮火纷飞的年代，跟着伟大领袖毛主席南征北战，和战士战斗在一起，生活在一起，劳动在一起的情景。那时，没有丝毫怕脏怕累的思想，而现在为什么产生了这种怕脏怕累的思想呢？就是因为革命胜利后，自己对思想改造抓得不紧，受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀。如果这样下去就要走上邪路。于是杨迁同志就在群众中亮了自己的活思想，请大家帮助。以后，他什么地方脏就到什么地方去，那里工作累就到那里去战斗。
    毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”杨迁同志学习了毛主席的最新指示，受到了极大的鼓舞和教育，信心更足了，干劲更大了。他坚持和工人劳动在一起，战斗在阶级斗争最复杂的地方。工人们亲切地称赞他是“永葆革命本色的好干部”。新华社通讯员　新华社记者（本报有删节）
