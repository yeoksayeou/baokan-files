	Smash the U.S.-Japan "Security" Treaty, Destroy U.S. Military Invasion Bases
	Japanese Workers and Students in Osaka Hold Anti-U.S. Rally
	Speaker Emphasizes: Combining Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with Japanese Revolutionary Practice, the Japanese People Will Achieve Liberation

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 27th: Tokyo news: Four hundred Japanese workers, youth, students, and women held a rally in Osaka City on the evening of the 26th to express their determination to fight to the end to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security" Treaty, destroy U.S. military bases, and reclaim Okinawa.

	This rally was organized by the Japan Mao Zedong Thought Institute.

	Japanese scholar Matsumura Ichinori said in his speech at the meeting that Chairman Mao's important inscription six years ago to Japanese workers, "As long as you seriously implement the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt," has great significance and is a universal truth applicable everywhere. The Japanese people must put Chairman Mao's important inscription into practice. He said, the road of the Japanese revolution will be tortuous, but as long as we seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely take the road of combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the Japanese revolution will definitely be victorious, and the Japanese people will definitely achieve liberation.

	After highly praising Chairman Mao for creatively developing Marxism-Leninism, Matsumura pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally has developed Lenin's theory on "State and Revolution," solving the problem of continuing the revolution under socialist conditions. Matsumura said, Chairman Mao summed up the experience of the proletarian dictatorship at home and abroad, pointing out that class struggle still exists under socialist conditions, and class struggle will be long-term and sometimes quite intense. If class struggle is not seriously carried out, it will cause the socialist state to degenerate and lead to the restoration of capitalism. This is Chairman Mao's epoch-making new theory that further develops the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian dictatorship, which is of great significance. Matsumura emphasized that in the contemporary era, without Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary struggles cannot be victorious.

	Matsumura strongly condemned Khrushchev for betraying Marxist-Leninist principles, pushing revisionism in the first socialist state created by Lenin, restoring capitalism, and kneeling before U.S. imperialism. Matsumura pointed out that the revisionist group led by Miyamoto in the Japanese Communist Party advocates a so-called "independent and autonomous" path, which is a pure Khrushchev revisionist path. Matsumura said, the Miyamoto group acts as a henchman for the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, vigorously advocating the "parliamentary road," playing a role that the reactionary Sato government cannot play.

	The secretary of the Fukuoka branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and representatives of youth from Fukuoka City and farmers from the northern foot of Mount Fuji reported on the struggles of the Japanese people against the U.S. military base in Sakimachi, the U.S. military ammunition depot in Yamada, and the U.S. military and "Self-Defense Forces" shooting range in northern Fuji.

	Matsunoto said, through our struggles, we have come to realize that Mao Zedong Thought is a weapon for revolutionary struggle. We must widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought so that the Japanese people can grasp this ideological weapon and wage a victorious struggle. The president of the Mao Zedong Thought Institute, Otsuka Yuzo, also spoke at the meeting.

	Tokyo's Shinjuku Station is an important transfer point for transporting fuel for U.S. military aircraft. On October 21, Japanese workers and students broke through the iron walls recently erected by the authorities, rushed into the station, and obstructed the transport of fuel for U.S. military aircraft.

    粉碎日美“安全”条约  拆除美军侵略基地
    日本大阪工人学生举行反美集会
    发言者强调：马列主义、毛泽东思想与日本革命实践结合，日本人民就能获得解放
    据新华社二十七日讯　东京消息：日本工人、青年、学生和妇女四百人，二十六日晚上在大阪市举行集会，表示要为粉碎日美“安全”条约、拆除美军基地和夺回冲绳而斗争到底。
    这次集会是日本毛泽东思想学院主办的。
    日本著名学者松村一人在会上讲话说，毛主席六年前书赠日本工人朋友们的重要题词“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”具有伟大意义，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。日本人民必须把毛主席的这一重要题词付诸实践。他说，日本革命的道路将是曲折的，但是只要认真学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，坚决走把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合的道路，日本革命就一定能够胜利，日本人民就一定能够获得解放。
    松村在高度赞扬毛主席创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义以后指出，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，发展了列宁关于“国家与革命”的学说，解决了在社会主义条件下继续革命的问题。松村说，毛主席总结了国际和国内无产阶级专政的经验，指出了在社会主义条件下仍然存在着阶级和阶级斗争，阶级斗争将是长期的，有时是相当激烈的。如果不认真地进行阶级斗争，就会使社会主义的国家变质，出现资本主义复辟。这是毛主席进一步发展马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政学说的具有划时代意义的崭新理论。松村强调指出，在当代离开了毛泽东思想，就不能胜利地进行革命斗争。
    松村强烈谴责赫鲁晓夫背叛马克思列宁主义原则，在列宁缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家推行修正主义，复辟资本主义，并向美帝国主义屈膝投降的滔天罪行。松村指出，日共宫本修正主义集团标榜的所谓“独立自主”的道路，是不折不扣的赫鲁晓夫修正主义道路。松村说，宫本集团充当美日反动派的帮凶，极力鼓吹“议会道路”，正在起着佐藤反动政府起不到的作用。
    日中友好协会（正统）福冈支部事务局长松野尾竹子以及福冈市的青年代表和北富士山麓的农民代表分别在会上介绍了日本人民反对美军坂付基地、反对美军山田军火库以及反对北富士美军和“自卫队”打靶场的斗争情况。
    松野尾说，我们通过斗争更加认识到，毛泽东思想是进行革命斗争的武器。我们必须广泛宣传毛泽东思想，使日本人民掌握这一思想武器，胜利地进行斗争。毛泽东思想学院院长大塚有章也在会上讲了话。（附图片）
    东京新宿车站是运输美军飞机燃料的重要转运站。日本工人和学生在十月二十一日突破当局最近用铁板筑起的围墙，冲进车站，阻止运输美军飞机燃料。
