The American people's movement is surging forward vigorously. In cities like Chicago and New York, black students have launched a struggle against racial discrimination. Seven thousand American soldiers demonstrated in San Francisco to oppose the U.S. invasion of Vietnam. Eighty thousand coal miners have gone on a nationwide strike.

		New York, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Washington: In recent days, black students in Chicago, Santa Barbara, and New York have launched a struggle against racial discrimination.

		In Chicago, 25,000 black middle school students went on strike on October 14, paralyzing 30 schools in the city. Thousands of black students held rallies in various parts of the city and demonstrated in front of the Board of Education and City Hall, protesting racial discrimination, demanding more black teachers, and calling for a memorial day for Malcolm X, the black leader killed by American reactionaries. The protesting black students also announced that they would go on strike every Monday until their demands are met.

		In Santa Barbara, a group of black students occupied a computer center in a building at the University of California on October 15, protesting racial discrimination. They built barricades with tables and chairs, sealing off the building.

		In New York, over 2,000 students from New York University demonstrated in front of the school on October 14, again protesting the reactionary principal's expulsion of a black teacher on trumped-up charges. Most of the participants in this demonstration were black students, but many white students also actively participated.

		Additionally, on October 14, in the U.S. capital Washington, near the White House, a violent struggle broke out among black youth. Despite the fascist authorities releasing tear gas to suppress the protests, the black youth fearlessly fought back, enduring the gas and using bricks and stones to engage in a fierce battle with the police.

		New York, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Washington: On October 12, a large number of American soldiers demonstrated in San Francisco, California, to oppose the U.S. invasion of Vietnam. This demonstration reflects the growing sentiment among American soldiers who do not want to be cannon fodder for the U.S. monopoly ruling class. Reports indicate that about 7,000 people participated in the demonstration.

		Many American soldiers, filled with strong indignation against the U.S. ruling monopoly class that forces them to go to Vietnam to die, broke through the reactionary "discipline" and "military law" of the U.S. fascist army. Dressed in uniform, they marched out of the barracks to participate in the demonstration. They held up signs opposing the U.S. invasion of Vietnam, marching from Golden Gate Park to City Hall in San Francisco, holding a massive demonstration, and gathering in front of City Hall to protest the U.S. invasion of Vietnam.

		On October 13, a large crowd gathered again in Lafayette Park across from the White House in Washington, D.C., to demonstrate in support of the American soldiers' anti-war demonstration.

		New York, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Washington: The nationwide strike by 80,000 American coal miners, which began on September 30, has lasted for half a month. This strike has paralyzed all bituminous coal mines in 22 states, dealing a severe blow to the U.S. monopoly capitalists.

		Due to continuous inflation in the U.S., the real wages of coal miners have been declining, and the U.S. monopoly capitalists, only concerned with increasing their exploitation of coal miners, have paid no attention to the safety of the miners. Coal dust flies everywhere in the mines, and many miners have contracted occupational diseases such as silicosis. Unable to bear it any longer, the American coal miners have risen up in strike, demanding wage increases and improved working conditions.

		The U.S. monopoly capitalists, frightened by the coal miners' strike, are now colluding with yellow union leaders to plot the sabotage of the strike.

    美国人民运动滚滚向前蓬勃发展
    芝加哥纽约等地黑人学生掀起反对种族歧视斗争；七千美国士兵在旧金山市示威游行反对美国侵越战争；八万名烟煤煤矿工人举行全国大罢工
    新华社十五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国芝加哥市、圣巴巴拉市和纽约市，连日来爆发了美国黑人学生反对种族歧视的斗争。
    在芝加哥市，二万五千名黑人中学生十四日举行罢课，使这个市的三十所中学陷于瘫痪。成千上万名黑人学生还在市内许多地方集会，并在教育委员会和市政厅前举行示威游行，反对种族歧视，要求增加黑人教师，要求为被美国反动派暗杀的黑人领袖马尔科姆·爱克斯订立纪念日等。示威的黑人学生还宣布今后每星期一都将罢课，直到提出的要求得到满足为止。
    在圣巴巴拉市，一群黑人学生十五日占领了加利福尼亚大学校舍的一个计算机中心，反对种族歧视。他们用桌子、椅子建成防栅，把这个大楼封锁起来。
    在纽约市，二千多名纽约大学学生十四日在学校前举行示威，再次抗议反动校长以莫须有的罪名开除一名黑人教师。参加这次示威的大部分是黑人学生，许多白人学生也积极参加了这次示威。
    此外，十四日，在美国首都华盛顿，离白宫不远的地方，还爆发了一场黑人青年的抗暴斗争。尽管法西斯当局施放催泪瓦斯进行镇压，但是黑人青年毫不畏惧，他们冒着瓦斯，用砖头、瓦块同警察进行了英勇搏斗。
    新华社十五日讯　华盛顿消息：大批美国士兵十二日在加利福尼亚州旧金山市举行示威游行，反对美国侵略越南战争。这次示威充分反映了越来越多的美国士兵不愿替美国垄断统治集团充当炮灰的心情。据报道，约有七千人参加了这次示威。
    许多美国现役士兵怀着对强迫他们到越南去送死的美国统治垄断集团的强烈愤慨，冲破了美国法西斯军队中反动的“军纪”、“军法”的束缚，穿着军装，走出军营，参加了示威游行。他们高举反对美国侵略越南的标语牌，从旧金山市的金门公园直到市政厅，举行了浩浩荡荡的大示威，并在市政厅前举行了反对美国侵略越南战争的集会。
    十三日，大批群众又在华盛顿市白宫（美国总统府）对面的拉斐特公园举行示威，支持美国士兵反对侵越战争的示威游行。
    新华社十五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国八万名烟煤煤矿工人从九月三十日开始举行的全国大罢工，已坚持了半个月。这次罢工使分布在美国二十二个州的所有烟煤煤矿全部陷于瘫痪，给了美国垄断资产阶级以严重的打击。
    由于美国国内通货不断膨胀，煤矿工人实际工资不断下降，再加上美国垄断资产阶级只顾加强对煤矿工人的剥削，根本不问煤矿工人的安全，煤矿中煤屑乱飞，大批矿工得了职业病——矽肺。美国煤矿工人忍无可忍，奋起罢工，要求增加工资，改善工作条件。
    被煤矿工人罢工吓坏了的美国垄断资产阶级现在正勾结黄色工会头头，阴谋破坏罢工。
