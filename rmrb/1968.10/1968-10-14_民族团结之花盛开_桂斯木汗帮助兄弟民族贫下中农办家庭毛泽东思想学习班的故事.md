The sun of Mao Zedong Thought shines over the Tian Shan Mountains, and the flower of national unity blooms everywhere. Guirsumuhan, a young woman from the Uyghur ethnic group, enthusiastically helps fellow ethnic minority poor and lower-middle peasants establish family Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fostering closer unity among the people of all ethnic groups based on Mao Zedong Thought. Her deeds have been warmly praised by everyone.

Guirsumuhan, an 18-year-old daughter of a poor peasant, has grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. In 1966, she was selected as an active promoter of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works in the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture. She was also chosen as a member of the Xinjiang Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Delegation to attend the National Day celebrations in Beijing, where she had the honor of meeting the great leader Chairman Mao. Upon her return, Guirsumuhan excitedly said, "Meeting Chairman Mao in Beijing is not only my personal greatest happiness but also the greatest happiness for the Uyghur people. We must closely follow Chairman Mao and forever make revolution!"

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Guirsumuhan joined the Red Guards in smashing the Four Olds and, together with poor and lower-middle peasants of various ethnic groups, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary fervor of the people of all ethnic groups deeply moved her. However, when she returned home, her mother was always concerned with the small matters of the family and paid little attention to national affairs. This made Guirsumuhan realize that if Mao Zedong Thought does not occupy the family stronghold, the bourgeois "self" would never be uprooted. With the support of the soldiers, she established a family Mao Zedong Thought study class. However, her mother was not enthusiastic, saying, "I am old and illiterate, I won't participate in the study class!" Guirsumuhan then persuaded her mother, saying, "Without studying Chairman Mao's works, your eyes are blurred; with Chairman Mao's works, you will see clearly. Now you only wash clothes and cook for the family, but after reading Chairman Mao's books, you can serve the broad masses." Her father, who was the director of the poor peasants' association in the production brigade, also said, "Chairman Mao's books are shining with golden words. The poor and lower-middle peasants must read Chairman Mao's books to make revolution." Her mother was inspired and agreed to participate in the study class.

After the family study class was established, Guirsumuhan's family often gathered to recall bitterness and sweetness, criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev such as "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," and "work points as the commander." This greatly raised the class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the whole family. The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated Guirsumuhan's family, and the spiritual outlook of the whole family changed significantly, especially her mother's transformation was the most profound. She became more devoted to Chairman Mao, acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and enthusiastically served the collective.

Guirsumuhan felt that it was not enough for only her family to establish a Mao Zedong Thought study class. She must mobilize the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the family stronghold, making every household red. She carried the red revolutionary treasure book and propagated Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, discussing with poor and lower-middle peasants of various ethnic groups the experiences and insights of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and helped them establish one family Mao Zedong Thought study class after another.

Hui ethnic member Ma Chengfu wanted to establish a Mao Zedong Thought study class at home, but his wife did not agree, saying, "There is a lot of work in the fields, and there are four children at home, there is no time to study." Ma Chengfu invited Guirsumuhan to his home to share her experiences. Guirsumuhan thought that this old poor peasant had a lot of bitterness from the old society, so she invited his 80-year-old grandmother to recall bitterness and sweetness, giving the whole family a vivid class education lesson, which awakened everyone's class consciousness. Ma Chengfu's family Mao Zedong Thought study class was quickly established. After the study class was established, the spiritual outlook of the whole family changed dramatically. Ma Chengfu applied what he learned from Chairman Mao's works. In August, two Han children were playing on a bridge and accidentally fell into the water. Ma Chengfu rescued them from the rapid current. The parents of the children, along with the children, went to Ma Chengfu's home to express their thanks. Ma Chengfu said, "We should all thank Chairman Mao. Poor people around the world are one family. It is Chairman Mao who taught me to do this."

Two elderly Han people saw everyone establishing family Mao Zedong Thought study classes and also wanted to establish one. However, the elderly couple was illiterate and felt helpless. Guirsumuhan knew about this and went to their home every day, teaching them the Chinese characters she learned from the soldiers one by one, and also teaching them to sing. Under her enthusiastic help, the two elderly Han people can now read Chairman Mao's latest instructions, memorize dozens of quotations from Chairman Mao, and sing several songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao. The elderly people excitedly said, "We poor peasants could not read books or recognize characters in the old society. Now that we are so old, we can understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasure book. It is all thanks to Guirsumuhan. This child is a good seedling educated by Mao Zedong Thought."

In the process of helping to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, Guirsumuhan's own class consciousness also continuously improved. There was a Han woman who was originally a good friend of Guirsumuhan. During the Cultural Revolution, they split into two factions and became estranged. Later, Guirsumuhan realized that this was caused by the Chinese Khrushchev's implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line. One day, this Han woman suddenly fell ill and needed to be sent to the hospital immediately, but there was no one at home to take care of her. Guirsumuhan knew about this and immediately found a car from the commune to send her to the hospital. Unfortunately, the hospital had no oxygen and could not perform the surgery. Guirsumuhan quickly borrowed oxygen from the commune, allowing the surgery to be performed in time, saving the woman's life. Later, the two became more united than before. Someone asked Guirsumuhan, "She has different views from you, why do you take such good care of her?" Guirsumuhan said, "We are all daughters of poor peasants, and we all love Chairman Mao. Our class interests are the same."

The Jian Gangshan Commune where Guirsumuhan lives is a multi-ethnic residential area, with Uyghur, Han, Hui, and Kazakh ethnic groups. In the past, due to the influence of old ideas, residents of different ethnic groups living in the same courtyard did not drink water from the same well, and they did not drink tea when visiting each other. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, old ideas were eliminated, and the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups based on Mao Zedong Thought was further strengthened. Now, every evening, in every courtyard, community members of various ethnic groups gather in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" together or to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev together.

Someone asked Guirsumuhan, "Why are you so enthusiastic about helping poor and lower-middle peasants of various ethnic groups establish family Mao Zedong Thought study classes?" Guirsumuhan replied, "The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause.' Chairman Mao is the great savior of our people of all ethnic groups. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for our poor and lower-middle peasants of all ethnic groups to make revolution forever. By establishing many study classes, the people of all ethnic groups master Mao Zedong Thought, and the dream of the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk to restore capitalism will never come true! The red mountains of the proletariat will never change color for thousands of years!"

    民族团结之花盛开
    ——桂斯木汗帮助兄弟民族贫下中农办家庭毛泽东思想学习班的故事
    毛泽东思想阳光普照天山南北，民族团结之花处处盛开。维吾尔族姑娘桂斯木汗，热情帮助兄弟民族贫下中农办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，使各族人民在毛泽东思想基础上更加亲密团结的事迹，受到了人们热情的赞扬。
    贫农女儿桂斯木汗今年十八岁，是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的。一九六六年，她被评为昌吉回族自治州活学活用毛主席著作积极分子，又被选为新疆工农兵代表团的成员，前往北京参加国庆观礼，见到了伟大领袖毛主席。回来后，桂斯木汗激动地说：“到北京见到毛主席，这不仅是我个人的最大幸福，也是我们维吾尔族人民的最大幸福，我们一定要紧跟毛主席，永远闹革命！”
    无产阶级文化大革命中，桂斯木汗和红卫兵小将们一起大破四旧，同各民族贫下中农一道狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。各族人民的革命激情，使她深受感动。可是回到家里，妈妈总是关心家里的小天地，不大关心国家大事。这使桂斯木汗认识到：毛泽东思想不占领家庭这个阵地，资产阶级的“私”字就断不了根。于是，她在解放军同志的支持下，办起了家庭毛泽东思想学习班。可是妈妈不上劲，她说：“我年纪老了，又不识字，不参加学习班啦！”桂斯木汗就劝妈妈说：“不学习毛主席著作，你的眼睛是模糊的，学了毛主席著作，才能心明眼亮。你现在只为家里人洗衣、煮饭，读了毛主席的书，能为广大人民服务。”桂斯木汗的爹爹是生产大队贫协主任，他也说：“毛主席的书字字闪金光，贫下中农翻身闹革命，一定要读毛主席的书。”妈妈受到启发，同意参加学习班。
    家庭学习班办起来以后，桂斯木汗一家经常在一起忆苦思甜，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，使全家人阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。毛泽东思想阳光照亮了桂斯木汗全家，一家人的精神面貌有了显著变化，特别是妈妈的变化更大。她更加热爱毛主席，按照毛主席的指示办事，热心为集体服务。
    桂斯木汗觉得光自己一家办好毛泽东思想学习班还是很不够的，必须发动广大贫下中农都用毛泽东思想占领家庭阵地，使千家万户一片红。于是她捧起红色革命宝书，四处宣传毛泽东思想，和各族贫下中农座谈办毛泽东思想学习班的心得体会，帮助各族贫下中农社员办起了一个个家庭毛泽东思想学习班。
    回族社员马成福想在家里办毛泽东思想学习班，但他的妻子却思想不通，说：“地里活儿一大堆，家里还有四个孩子缠住腿，没时间学习。”马成福就把桂斯木汗请到家里来介绍经验。桂斯木汗心想这家老贫农在旧社会有一肚子苦水，就请他家八十岁的老奶奶忆苦思甜，给全家上了一堂生动的阶级教育课，启发了大家的阶级觉悟。马成福家的毛泽东思想学习班很快就办起来了。学习班办起来后，全家人的精神面貌焕然一新。马成福学了毛主席的著作就用。今年八月，两个汉族娃娃在桥上玩，不慎落水，马成福把他们从急流中抢救上来。孩子的父母带着孩子到马成福家表示感谢，马成福说：“我们要共同感谢毛主席，天下贫农是一家，是毛主席他老人家教我这样做的。”
    两位汉族老人见大家都办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，自己也想办。可是老两口不识字，感到为难。桂斯木汗知道了，就每天到他们家去，把从解放军那里学会的汉字一个一个地教给两位老人，还教老人唱歌。在她热心帮助下，现在这两位汉族老人已能朗读毛主席的最新指示，记住了几十条毛主席语录，会唱好几首歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲。老人们激动地说：“我们贫下中农在旧社会念不起书，识不了字，现在我们这么大岁数了，能看懂毛主席的革命宝书，都是桂斯木汗教会的，这孩子是毛泽东思想教育出来的好苗苗。”
    桂斯木汗在帮助办毛泽东思想学习班的过程中，自己的阶级觉悟也不断提高。有一个汉族妇女，原是桂斯木汗的好朋友。在文化大革命中，她俩分成了两派，关系疏远了。后来，桂斯木汗认识到这是中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线造成的。一天，这个汉族妇女得了急病，必须立即送医院治疗，可是，当时家里没人照顾她。桂斯木汗知道了，立即从公社找来汽车把她送到医院。不巧医院没有氧气，不能动手术，桂斯木汗又急忙从公社借来氧气，使手术得以及时进行，治好了这位妇女的病。后来，她们两人团结得比以前更紧。有人问桂斯木汗：“她和你观点不同，你为什么这样热心照顾她？”桂斯木汗说：“我们都是贫下中农子女，都热爱毛主席，我们的阶级利益是一致的。”
    桂斯木汗所在的井冈山公社是个多民族聚居的地区，这里有维吾尔族、汉族、回族、哈萨克族。过去由于旧思想的影响，同住在一个院落里的不同民族的居民，不吃同一口井里的水，互相串门时喝不上一杯茶。无产阶级文化大革命中，旧思想破除了，各族人民在毛泽东思想基础上的大团结进一步增强了。现在每天晚上，座座院落里，各民族社员围坐在毛主席像前共同学习“老三篇”，或是一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。
    有人问桂斯木汗：为什么这样热心地帮助各民族贫下中农办家庭毛泽东思想学习班？桂斯木汗答道：“伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：‘国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。’毛主席是我们各族人民的大救星，毛泽东思想是指导我们各族贫下中农永远闹革命的指路明灯，大办学习班，各民族人民都掌握了毛泽东思想，中国赫鲁晓夫之流复辟资本主义的梦想就永远不会得逞！无产阶级的红色江山，千秋万代也不会变颜色！”
