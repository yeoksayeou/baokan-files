On the night of October 10, the auditorium of the Beijing New China Printing Factory was brightly lit. The revolutionary workers of the factory and the Sichuan Workers' Delegation exchanged experiences on how to thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation after watching a cultural performance praising the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. At this moment, an elderly worker with white hair, tears in his eyes, stepped onto the stage and sang a self-composed Sichuan folk song, "A Red Heart Forever Loyal to the Party." He sang passionately:

The sun rises with golden rays,
The laboring people rise and shine.
We will never forget the Communist Party,
Chairman Mao's kindness is as heavy as a mountain.

He then raised his left hand, which was broken when he was twelve years old while herding cattle for a landlord, and denounced the evil old society:

Now thinking of the old society,
Tears of indignation flow endlessly.
Landlords and capitalists are so treacherous,
Exploiting the blood and sweat of the laboring people.
The landlord made me herd cattle,
My wrist was broken, it was so tragic.
Sweet potatoes and radishes boiled into porridge,
Facing the yellow earth, back to the sky.
The laboring people suffer and endure,
Many died in the wilderness and by the river.
Since the Communist Party came,
The laboring people saw the light of day.
Holding the precious book to study till old age,
A lifetime of changing worldviews.
A red heart forever loyal to the Party,
Following Chairman Mao forever forward.

The old worker's song deeply moved everyone's heart. Many workers shed tears, and the auditorium frequently erupted with slogans: "Never forget class bitterness! Remember the blood debt!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!"

The person who sang on stage was Han Qingyun, a construction worker from the Fifth Company of the First Division of the Construction Department of Zigong City, Sichuan Province.

Han Qingyun is sixty-four years old this year. People had advised him, "You now have eleven grandchildren, and your life is very fulfilling. You can retire." However, Han Qingyun, though old in age, is red in heart and resolute in will. He said, "Never forget where you came from. I cannot retire; I want to follow Chairman Mao and do a lifetime of revolution." This September, he became a member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team that entered Zigong No. 7 Middle School, and with his comrades, shouldered the responsibility of leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure. This time, he came to Chairman Mao's side and saw the great leader he had longed for day and night. Thinking of the past and looking at the present, Han Qingyun had so much to say to Chairman Mao and so many songs to sing for him. In the New China Printing Factory, he also picked up the bamboo clappers he carried with him and recited a fast-paced speech, "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism," expressing his boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, his determination to thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and his resolve to forever keep the country red.

Han Qingyun's performance moved every worker present. The revolutionary workers of the New China Printing Factory rushed up to him and pinned one Mao badge after another on his chest, presenting him with a pocket-sized, hardcover edition of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" printed by their factory. Han Qingyun held the red "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and tears flowed uncontrollably. He said excitedly: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We, the working class, will forever be loyal to you. I will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. I will bring back the precious experiences of the Beijing workers to Sichuan to bloom and bear fruit! I will forever follow you, old man, and be a lifelong "old ox" for the people!

    人老心红永向党
    十月十日夜，北京新华印刷厂的礼堂里灯火通明。这个厂的革命职工和四川工人代表团交流了认真搞好斗、批、改的经验后，正在给工人代表们表演自己编排的热情赞颂毛泽东思想伟大胜利的文艺节目。这时，一位头发花白的老工人，含着热泪登上舞台，唱起了自编的四川山歌《一颗红心永向党》。他激动地高唱：
    太阳出来金光闪，劳动人民把身翻。
    翻身不忘共产党，毛主席恩情重如山。
    接着，他举起自己十二岁时给地主放牛被打断的左手，控诉万恶的旧社会：
    如今想起旧社会，悲愤的眼泪流不完。
    地主资本家多凶险，剥削劳动人民的血和汗。
    地主逼我把牛看，手腕打断真惨然。
    红苕萝卜煮稀饭，脸朝黄土背朝天。
    劳动人民受苦又受难，多少人死在野地和河边。
    自从来了共产党，劳动人民见青天。
    手捧宝书学到老，一辈子改造世界观。
    一颗红心向着党，跟着毛主席永向前。
    老工人的歌声，紧紧扣住了人们的心弦。许多工人流出了眼泪，会场上不时爆发出口号声：“不忘阶级苦！牢记血泪仇！”“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    上台歌唱的，是四川省自贡市建工部所属一局五公司的建筑工人韩青云。
    韩青云今年六十四岁了。人们曾劝他：“你现在祖孙十一口，日子过得很美满，可以退休了。”但是，韩青云人老心红意志坚，他说：“翻身不忘本，我不能退休，要跟毛主席干一辈子革命。”今年九月，他成为进驻自贡市七中工人毛泽东思想宣传队的队员，和他的战友们一起，肩负起了领导上层建筑斗、批、改的重任。这次，他又来到毛主席身边，见到了日夜盼望的伟大领袖毛主席。想想过去，看看今天，韩青云有多少贴心的话要对毛主席讲，有多少热情的歌要对毛主席唱。在新华印刷厂，他还拿起随身带着的竹板，说了一段快板《要斗私，批修》，表达了他无限忠于毛主席，誓把修正主义根子彻底铲除，永保祖国江山万年红的决心。
    韩青云的表演，激动着在场的每一个工人的心。新华印刷厂的革命职工拥上去，在韩青云的胸前佩上了一枚又一枚毛主席像章，送给他一本这个厂印制的《毛泽东选集》四卷合订袖珍精装本。韩青云捧着这本红彤彤的《毛泽东选集》，眼泪不由自主地流了出来。他激动地说：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们工人阶级永远忠于您。我要永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，把北京工人的宝贵经验带回去，让它在四川开花结果！我要永远跟着您老人家，做一辈子人民的“老黄牛”！
