The sound of cannons boomed in the tunnel, and the soldiers waved their red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, shouting "Down with China's Khrushchev!" They gathered together to hold a criticism meeting on the construction site. They used the time between blasting and clearing smoke to carry out a revolutionary criticism, firing at China's Khrushchev.

The Seventh Company of a certain unit of the Railway Corps was tasked with the arduous job of tunnel construction. In late August of this year, a large amount of water gushed into the tunnel, with over six thousand tons flowing out daily. Every time a hole was drilled for blasting, water would spray out like a dragon. The tunnel was filled with water from front to back and side to side. The soldiers worked in the water, soaked to the skin, shivering from the cold. This also made drilling holes, loading explosives, and detonating them very difficult.

The Party branch, facing these difficulties, addressed the soldiers' thoughts by studying Chairman Mao's works. They realized that in the face of difficulties, one must rely on political and ideological work. When people's consciousness is raised, they become brave, active, creative, disciplined, and have a revolutionary spirit of enduring hardship. Thus, they actively organized the entire company to study Chairman Mao's sayings on "Communist Party members" and "revolutionary heroism," guiding everyone to criticize and repudiate themselves and the revisionists, to think of "loyalty," to act loyally, and to strive for loyalty. The company carried out revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's "theory of the fusion of public and private interests" and "philosophy of survival." The more they studied, the more loyal they became to the great leader Chairman Mao; the more they criticized, the more they hated China's Khrushchev; the more they studied and criticized, the more confident they became in overcoming the underground water. The comrades indignantly said, "We revolutionary soldiers have clear minds and sharp eyes. China's Khrushchev wants to corrupt Party members with a bourgeois worldview, turning them into selfish, vulgar individuals. He will never succeed." The Communist Party members loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings, "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and put revolutionary interests first, subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests," to counter China's Khrushchev. Everyone said, "We, the People's Liberation Army, have a fearless revolutionary spirit and have never been subdued by powerful enemies. Will we be intimidated by these difficulties today? As long as we carry on the spirit of bravery, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous fighting, and as long as we are loyal to Chairman Mao, no difficulty is insurmountable."

With Mao Zedong Thought leading the way, the "self" in their minds vanished. The revolutionary soldiers were fearless of cold, hardship, and death, each one a towering hero. The cadres and Communist Party members led the way. Where the water was deepest, they fought there, encouraging everyone to struggle tenaciously against the difficulties. The members of the wind gun team had just drilled a hole two feet deep when water sprayed out, soaking their hands, bodies, and faces. The water sprayed into their clothes through the openings in their raincoats, quickly soaking their cotton clothes. The icy underground water was bone-chilling. However, the comrades kept working, finishing one hole after another. A soldier from the Ninth Platoon, nicknamed "Little Tiger," Bo Donghewu said, "The water may be big, but our resolve to overcome the underground water is even greater; the water may be cold, but our hearts, loyal to Chairman Mao, are forever burning." Those loading the explosives also faced difficulties. The bottom charges in over a foot of water were hard to reach. As they loaded the explosives, the water poured down their sleeves, soaking their cotton clothes and pants, filling their rubber boots. The comrades were so cold that their bodies shivered and their feet went numb, but no one retreated a step. In the water, they showed their loyalty, and in the face of difficulties, they showed their heroism. They thought of carrying out Chairman Mao's great call: "Grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness for war," and of implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They turned the construction site into a battlefield for criticizing China's Khrushchev and a training ground for self-criticism and repudiation of revisionism, accelerating the revolutionization of their thoughts. The comrades said, "The revolutionary furnace forges pure steel, and the cold water is good for self-criticism." Those in charge of blasting, the more difficulties they faced, the more they grasped self-criticism. They said with deep feeling, "Before loading the explosives, one must first load a cannon in one's mind; before detonating, one must first detonate in one's mind, blowing up the 'self.' Once the 'self' is blown up, one can devote oneself fully to the work and be loyal to Chairman Mao."

The sound of cannons boomed again, and the soldiers, waving their red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, quickly gathered together. Amidst the shouts of "Down with China's Khrushchev!" the tunnel criticism meeting began again.

Deputy Political Instructor Jia Xiu was the first to speak. He said, "China's Khrushchev is desperately peddling the bourgeois reactionary goods of 'suffer first, benefit later' and 'suffer a little loss to gain a big advantage.' He attempts to lead us down the path of selfishness, chasing fame and profit, gradually turning into revisionists. We must not be fooled. Communist Party members must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, 'selfless, active, self-disciplined, and hardworking,' like old oxen, diligently working for the people. In our struggle against water, it is indeed bitter, but to suffer for the revolution is glorious, the more bitter, the sweeter the heart."

As soon as the first comrade finished speaking, Communist Party member and squad leader Mu Changfa eagerly said, "We are Chairman Mao's soldiers. To be selfless and revolutionary is our duty. It is with 'public' as our goal and 'public' as our motive that we can produce a fearless revolutionary spirit."

The comrades eagerly took turns speaking, and the criticism meeting became more and more lively. At this time, the smoke from the blasting cleared. Everyone re-entered the water to continue the battle. They had just finished the criticism meeting, filled with hatred towards China's Khrushchev and unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, with high morale, daring to fight and struggle, overcoming all difficulties to achieve one victory after another.

Harsh environments temper true gold, and selflessness shows loyalty. Once, about forty meters past the eleventh horizontal tunnel, an electrical short circuit caused a fire, igniting the explosives in the water cannons. Platoon Leader Zhou Dechang discovered it and immediately sensed that a major accident was about to happen. If the explosives detonated, the lives of the class brothers in the tunnel would be seriously threatened, and a large amount of machinery and equipment and the tunnel built with the comrades' hard work would be seriously damaged. At this critical moment, Zhou Dechang's mind flashed with the golden words: "Put revolutionary interests first." He had only one thought: "I am willing to sacrifice myself to protect the class brothers and state property!" Zhou Dechang, with astonishing speed, rushed towards the fire. Four soldiers followed closely behind him. With every step they took, they expressed their unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep affection for their class brothers. In front of them, the thick smoke made it hard to breathe. Time was so precious! If the fire was extinguished one second earlier, the class brothers' lives would be safer; if one more package of explosives was rescued, state property would suffer less damage. But there was not a drop of water or a fire extinguisher in sight. What to do? Zhou Dechang remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Care more about the Party and the masses than about oneself, and care more about others than about oneself." He fearlessly rushed towards the fire, hugging the thirty-plus pounds of six unburned packages of explosives and safely moving them to the eleventh horizontal tunnel. He returned to the fire, his clothes on fire, his flesh burning, but his resolve to extinguish the fire and rescue his comrades remained unshaken. He continued to struggle tenaciously against the fire. In an instant, the remaining half box of explosives caught fire. With a loud boom, the tunnel was filled with gunpowder smoke, and stones flew everywhere. Zhou Dechang was seriously injured. Because a large amount of explosives were rescued, the explosion was less powerful, protecting the class brothers' safety and reducing the damage to state property. Zhou Dechang was blown several meters away, falling onto the tracks, covered in wounds, and with severe internal bleeding. At this moment, he thought not of himself but of "how are the other comrades?" He endured the pain, struggling to crawl, search, and find his class brothers in the tunnel. When he found the unconscious soldier Zhang Derong, he used all his strength to pull a broken air pipe to Zhang Derong's face, dispersing the gunpowder smoke and bringing him fresh air. Zhang Derong woke up and found Zhou Dechang unconscious beside him.

The power of examples is infinite. The Party branch recognized that Zhou Dechang's deeds were the most powerful criticism of China's Khrushchev and the best and most vivid education for the comrades. They immediately organized the entire company to criticize China's Khrushchev's "philosophy of survival" and "philistine philosophy" using this living example.

Soldier Liu Huanxi could no longer suppress his anger and was the first to speak: "'To die for the people is to die a good death.' China's Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, desperately spread the reactionary fallacies of 'cherishing oneself' and 'protecting one's life and health' to corrupt our souls, attempting to make us lose the proletarian revolutionary spirit of 'bravery in battle and fearlessness of sacrifice.' We must take Zhou Dechang's revolutionary heroism as an example, tempering our loyalty to Chairman Mao in the struggle, establishing a life view of fearlessness of hardship and death, and being ready to sacrifice for the revolution."

When it came to the "philosophy of survival" and "philistine philosophy" advocated by China's Khrushchev, everyone was filled with rage: "Communist Party members armed with Mao Zedong Thought, for the revolution and for the cause of communism, are the most self-sacrificing and have the most revolutionary firmness. The 'philistine philosophy' and 'philosophy of survival' are incompatible with us." Communist Party member Zhang Derong said, "Our lives are given by Chairman Mao, not some private property. The life and death of a Communist Party member are for the Party, for the people, and for the revolution. This time, I fearlessly rushed to extinguish the fire, thinking not of personal safety but of the class brothers and state property. A Communist Party member, to defend Chairman Mao and for the revolutionary cause, must fight selflessly. We must raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to bury the 'philosophy of survival.'"

The criticism meeting was passionate, wave after wave, ending with the shouts of "Down with China's Khrushchev!" and "Eliminate the poison of the 'philosophy of survival'!"

The Party branch of the Seventh Company, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "Grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness for war," organized the comrades to set up a battlefield in their souls, fighting self-criticism and repudiation of revisionism as the vanguard. According to the construction conditions, they guided Party members and soldiers to select and study a passage from Chairman Mao's Quotations based on their own thoughts, criticizing China's Khrushchev's "theory of the fusion of public and private interests" and "philosophy of survival" as a target. They used Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions. They turned every battle, every hole drilled, every basket of debris shoveled, and every cart pushed into a self-criticism battle. The more they fought, the redder their hearts became, and the stronger their public-spirited thoughts became; the tunnel was pushed forward step by step, and the "public" Great Wall in their minds was continuously strengthened and extended.

    隧道里的炮声
    ——记铁道兵某部七连把隧道施工现场变为批判中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化论”的战场
    隧道里的炮声轰隆一响，战士们挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高喊着“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的口号，汇聚在一起，举行工地现场批判会。他们利用放炮排烟时间，开展革命大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫开炮。
    七连担负艰巨的隧道施工任务。今年八月下旬，洞内出大水，每天要流出六千多吨。每打完一个炮眼，水就象水龙一样地往外喷。坑道里，前后、左右到处都喷水。战士们在水里作业，每天都是一身湿淋淋的，冻得直打哆嗦。同时给打炮眼、装药、点炮带来了很大的困难。
    党支部面对困难，针对活思想，学习毛主席著作。认识到，在困难面前，必须发挥政治思想工作的威力。人的觉悟提高了，勇敢也有了，积极性也有了，创造性也有了，组织纪律性也有了，吃苦的革命精神也有了。于是，积极组织全连学习毛主席关于“共产党员”和“革命英雄主义”的语录，引导全连同志斗私批修，心往“忠”字想，步往“忠”字迈，劲往“忠”字上使。连队开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化论”、“活命哲学”。越学，对伟大领袖毛主席越忠；越批，对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨；越学越批，对战胜地下水的信心越足。同志们气愤地说：“我们革命战士心最明，眼最亮，中国赫鲁晓夫想用资产阶级世界观来腐蚀党员，要使党员变成一心为私的庸俗小人，永远办不到。”共产党员们高声背诵毛主席的“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”的教导来回击中国赫鲁晓夫。大家说：“我们人民解放军，具有大无畏的革命精神，从不被强敌所屈服，难道我们今天就被这点困难吓倒吗？我们只要发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，只要对毛主席怀着一颗忠心，天大的困难也难不住。”
    毛泽东思想挂了帅，头脑里的“私”全跑开。革命战士不怕冷、不怕苦、不怕死，个个是顶天立地的英雄好汉。干部、共产党员走在最前面。哪里水深，就在哪里战斗，在水中鼓舞大家顽强地向困难搏斗。风枪班的同志，炮眼刚打到两尺深，水喷射出来，喷得手上、身上、脸上到处都是水，喷得眼睛都睁不开。水喷到脸上，通过脖子上的雨衣开口处，直往身上灌，穿的棉衣很快就湿透了。冰冷的地下水，冷得扎骨。然而，同志们一个劲地干着，都是一口气打完一个眼。被大家称为“小老虎”的九班小战士董合文说：“水虽大，没有我们战胜地下水的决心大；水虽冷，我们无限忠于毛主席的心永远是滚烫的。”装炮的同志也很困难，打的底炮在一尺多深的水中摸不着，一边装药，大水就一边顺着袖口往身上灌，浸湿了棉衣，浸透了棉裤，把两只水鞋都灌得满满的。同志们冻得浑身发冷，两脚发麻，但是谁也没有后退一步，在大水里献忠心，困难面前逞英雄。大家想的是坚决执行毛主席的伟大号召：“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”，想的是实现毛主席的伟大战略部署。大家把工地当作批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场，当作斗私批修、加速思想革命化的练兵场。同志们说：“革命熔炉炼纯钢，大水刺骨好斗私。”负责爆破的同志们，越是困难越是抓紧斗私。他们瞎一个炮就查一次原因。他们深有体会地说：“在装炮之前，首先要在自己头脑里装一个炮；在放炮之前，首先要在自己头脑里放炮，把‘私’字炸掉。炸掉了私心，对工作就全心，对毛主席就有忠心。”
    轰隆隆的炮声又响了，战士们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，又迅速汇集在一起。在一片“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的口号声中，隧道批判会又开始了。
    副指导员贾秀首先开火。他说：“中国赫鲁晓夫拚命向党员兜售‘吃苦在前，得利在后’，‘吃小亏，占大便宜’的资产阶级反动黑货。他妄图把我们引向利己主义的邪道，追名逐利，逐步演变成修正主义分子。我们决不能上当。共产党员就是要按照毛主席的教导，‘大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干’，象老黄牛那样，勤勤恳恳地为人民工作。我们与水斗争，尽管很苦，但为革命吃苦，越苦越光荣，越苦心越甜。”
    第一个同志发言话音刚落，共产党员、班长慕长发抢着说：“我们是毛主席的战士，一心为公、一心为革命是我们的本份。我们正是以‘公’字为目的，以‘公’字为动力，才能产生大无畏的革命精神。”
    同志们争着发言，批判会越开越热烈。这时，炮烟排除了。大家又进入水里继续战斗。大家刚刚开完批判会，带着对中国赫鲁晓夫满腔仇恨，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，斗志昂扬，敢打敢拚，排除万难，去争取一个又一个的胜利。
    艰苦环境炼真金，一心为公献忠心。有一次，十一号横洞过去四十多米远的地方电线短路起火，引燃了装有水炮的炸药。三排长周德昌发现了，马上预感到一场重大事故即将发生。如果炸药爆炸了，隧道里的阶级兄弟的生命将受到严重威胁，大量的机械设备和同志们辛勤劳动建成的隧道将会遭受严重的破坏。在这千钧一发之际，周德昌脑子里闪出了金光闪闪的大字：“以革命利益为第一生命”。他心里只有一个念头：“宁愿牺牲自己，也要保护阶级兄弟和国家财产！”周德昌以惊人的速度，向火堆冲去。四个战士紧紧跟在他的后头。他们每前进一步，都表达了对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚和对阶级兄弟无比爱护的深厚感情。面前浓烟滚滚，使人窒息。时间是多么宝贵！提前一秒钟把火扑灭，阶级兄弟的生命就多一分安全；多抢出一包炸药，国家财产就能减少一分损失。可是，眼前没有一滴水，没有一件灭火工具。怎么办？周德昌牢记毛主席的教导：“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重”。奋不顾身扑向火堆，抱起还没有燃着的三十多斤重的六包炸药安全地转移到了十一号横洞，返身又冲向火堆，烈火烧着了衣服，烧痛了皮肉，也动摇不了他扑灭烈火，抢救战友的决心，继续顽强地同烈火搏斗。霎时间，剩下的半箱炸药着火了。随着“轰”的一声巨响，隧道里硝烟弥漫，砾石横飞，周德昌身负重伤。由于大量炸药被抢出，爆炸力减小，保护了阶级兄弟的安全，国家财产也免受严重损失。周德昌却被气浪冲出好几米，摔倒在轨道上，遍身鳞伤，肺部严重出血。在这样的时刻，他想到的不是自己，而是“别的同志怎么样了？”他忍着剧痛，艰难地在隧道里爬呀、摸呀、寻找阶级兄弟。当摸到昏倒的战士张德荣时，他拚尽全力把一根炸破了的风管，拉到张德荣面前，给张德荣驱散硝烟，送来新鲜空气。张德荣醒来后，才发现周德昌昏倒在自己身边。
    榜样的力量是无穷的。党支部认识到周德昌的事迹，是对中国赫鲁晓夫最有力的批判，是对同志们最好的最生动的教育。于是抓住这个活生生的事例，立即组织全连同志批判中国赫鲁晓夫“活命哲学”、“市侩哲学”。
    战士刘焕喜早就抑制不住内心的怒火，首先发言：“‘为人民而死，就是死得其所’。中国赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，拚命散布‘钟爱自己’，‘保护自己的生命与健康’的反动谬论来腐蚀我们的灵魂，妄图使我们丧失‘勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲’的无产阶级的革命精神。我们一定要以周德昌的革命英雄主义为榜样，在斗争中锤炼对毛主席的一颗忠心，树立一不怕苦，二不怕死，为革命勇于献身的共产主义人生观。”
    提起中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“活命哲学”、“市侩哲学”，大家怒火万丈：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党员为了革命，为了共产主义事业，最富有自我牺牲精神，最有革命的坚定性，‘市侩哲学’‘活命哲学’与我们水火不相容。”共产党员张德荣同志说：“我们的生命是毛主席给的，绝不是什么私有财产。一个共产党员的生和死，都是为了党，为了人民，为了革命。我这次奋不顾身去扑灭烈火，想到的不是个人安危，而是阶级兄弟，国家的财产。一个共产党员，为了保卫毛主席，为了革命的利益，就是要忘我地战斗下去。我们要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，埋葬‘活命哲学’。”
    批判会群情激昂，一浪高一浪，在“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“肃清‘活命哲学’流毒！”的口号声中结束了。
    七连党支部，遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的教导，就是这样在施工中组织同志们在灵魂深处摆战场，斗私批修当尖兵。根据施工的条件，引导党员、战士针对自己的活思想选学一段毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化论”、“活命哲学”的一个黑靶，用毛泽东思想统帅自己的行动。把每一场战斗，打一排炮眼，扒一筐碴，推一趟车，看成一次斗私的战斗。大家越斗心越红，越斗为公的思想越强；隧道不断地向前推进，同志们头脑里的“公”字长城不断加固延长。
