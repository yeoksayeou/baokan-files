The fascist military regime in Indonesia is hurriedly auctioning off vast tracts of forest resources to imperialist powers led by the United States, turning vast forest areas into "leased lands" for foreign monopolies.

According to reports from foreign news agencies in mid-September from Jakarta, in the deceptive "development plan" of the Indonesian fascist regime, the area of forests auctioned off to foreign monopoly groups alone amounts to 13 million hectares. In the first eight months of this year, this reactionary regime has already signed agreements with 25 foreign timber monopolies to sell off 2.4 million hectares of forest land. It is currently negotiating with another 36 foreign timber monopoly groups to sign agreements to sell off forest resources. According to reports, these foreign timber monopoly groups will be able to obtain the right to log in Indonesia within the next few months.

    印尼反动派拍卖森林资源
    印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权正在加紧大面积地向以美国为首的帝国主义廉价拍卖森林资源，使广大森林地带沦为外国垄断资本的“租借地”。
    据外国通讯社九月中旬从雅加达传出的消息透露，在印尼法西斯政权的骗人的“发展计划”中，仅向外国垄断资本集团拍卖的森林面积，就达一千三百万公顷。今年头八个月，这个反动政权已经同二十五家外国木材垄断公司签订了出卖森林面积达二百四十万公顷的协定。并且正同另外三十六家外国木材垄断资本集团商谈签订出卖森林资源的协定。据报道，这些外国木材垄断资本集团在今后几个月内，就可以从印尼法西斯政权手中获得采伐木材的权利。
