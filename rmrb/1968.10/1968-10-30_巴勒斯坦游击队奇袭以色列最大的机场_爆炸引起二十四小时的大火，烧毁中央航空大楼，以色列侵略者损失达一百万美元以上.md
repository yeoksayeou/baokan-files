Palestinian guerrillas raided Israel's largest airport. The explosion caused a 24-hour fire, destroying the central aviation building, and the Israeli aggressors suffered losses exceeding one million dollars.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Damascus on the 28th, Damascus newspapers reported that on the 24th, Palestinian guerrillas blew up the largest airport in Israel, which is a tool of American imperialist aggression—Lydda Airport. The explosion caused a 24-hour fire, dealing a heavy blow to the Israeli aggressors. It is estimated that this explosion caused Israel to suffer losses exceeding one million dollars.

Lydda Airport is only eleven miles from the heart of the Israeli-controlled area, Tel Aviv. On that day, Palestinian guerrilla fighters disguised themselves and infiltrated the airport, placing timed explosives in the airport's power center. The explosion caused a massive fire. The Israeli authorities were in a state of panic, dispatching large numbers of firefighters and troops to the scene for rescue. Despite this, the raging fire destroyed the four-story central aviation building within the airport.

Recently, Palestinian guerrillas have intensified their attacks within Israeli-controlled areas, achieving significant results. In addition to blowing up Lydda Airport, Palestinian guerrillas have launched 24 attacks in the past week in the Besan Valley, Jerusalem, Betat Kfar, Abu al-Sus, Umm Sidra, the Negev Desert, and other places. They annihilated approximately 250 Israeli occupying troops, attacked and destroyed 16 Israeli strongholds, including five large military camps, destroyed 22 military vehicles, damaged a factory, and blew up a section of railway.

The two most successful battles occurred on the 22nd and 24th. On the 22nd, the "Storm" commando unit of "Fatah" (Palestine National Liberation Movement) launched an attack in Abu al-Sus, destroying most of an Israeli military camp, an ammunition depot, a supply depot, and a heavy machine gun, killing a large number of enemy troops. On the 24th, the "Storm" commando unit attacked an Israeli large military camp in Umm Sidra, setting the entire camp on fire and killing and wounding a large number of enemy troops, including a high-ranking officer.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Cairo, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine recently issued comprehensive battle reports here.

The battle report issued by the Palestine Liberation Organization stated that its guerrilla forces, from April to September this year, conducted 116 battles in occupied Arab lands, killing and wounding approximately 1,300 Israeli aggressors.

The report said that the guerrillas also destroyed 75 half-track vehicles, 29 jeeps, 19 troop transport vehicles, 5 heavy tanks, 4 mine-clearing vehicles, and 39 artillery pieces belonging to the enemy forces.

The battle report issued by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine stated that its guerrilla forces conducted 45 battles in the occupied Golan Heights in Syria in the first half of October this year, killing and wounding 175 Israeli aggressors and destroying 38 enemy vehicles.

    巴勒斯坦游击队奇袭以色列最大的机场
    爆炸引起二十四小时的大火，烧毁中央航空大楼，以色列侵略者损失达一百万美元以上
    据新华社大马士革二十八日电　据大马士革报纸报道，巴勒斯坦游击队二十四日用炸药爆炸了美帝国主义侵略工具以色列的最大机场——利达机场，爆炸引起了二十四小时大火，给以色列侵略者以沉重打击。据估计，这次爆炸使以色列损失达一百万美元以上。
    利达机场距离以色列统治区的心脏特拉维夫城只有十一英里。当天，巴勒斯坦游击战士化装潜入这个机场后，把有定时装置的炸药放在机场的电力中心，炸药爆炸引起冲天大火。以色列当局惊慌万状，派遣大批消防队和军队前往抢救。尽管如此，熊熊烈火把机场内四层的中央航空大楼烧毁。
    最近，巴勒斯坦游击队在以色列统治区内加强了袭击活动，取得了很大的战果。除爆炸了利达机场外，巴勒斯坦游击队在过去一周里，还在贝桑河谷、耶路撒冷、贝塔特克法、阿布尔苏斯、乌姆西德拉、内格夫沙漠等地发动了二十四次袭击，歼灭了约二百五十多名以色列占领军，袭击和摧毁了以色列的十六个据点，其中包括五个大军营，击毁了二十二辆军车，破坏了一个工厂和炸毁一段铁路。
    取得战果最大的两次战斗是发生在二十二日和二十四日。二十二日，“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦民族解放运动）所属的“暴风”突击队在阿布尔苏斯发动的一次袭击中，击毁了一个以色列军营的大部分、一个弹药库、一个供应库、一挺重机枪，打死大批敌军。二十四日，“暴风”突击队在乌姆西德拉袭击了一个以色列大军营，使整个军营着火燃烧，并且打死打伤大批敌军，其中包括一名高级军官。
    新华社开罗电　巴勒斯坦解放组织和解放巴勒斯坦人民阵线最近分别在这里发表综合战报。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织发表的战报说，它组织的游击队，从今年四月到九月在被占领的阿拉伯土地上进行的一百十六次战斗中，打死打伤以色列侵略军约一千三百人。
    战报说，游击队还击毁了敌军半履带车七十五辆、吉普车二十九辆、部队运输车十九辆、重型坦克五辆、探雷车四辆、大炮三十九门。
    解放巴勒斯坦人民阵线发表的战报说，它组织的游击队今年十月上半月在叙利亚的被占领的戈兰高地的四十五次战斗中，打死打伤以色列侵略军一百七十五名，击毁敌军车辆三十八辆。
