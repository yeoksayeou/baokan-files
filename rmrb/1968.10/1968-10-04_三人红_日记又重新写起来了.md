The "Three Red" diary has started again.

"With the enthusiastic help of the worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the 'Three Red' diary has started again!" This moving story was broadcast from the Beijing Institute of Power Broadcasting Station. Members of the worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the institute, comrades Hou Bing and Xu Shulan, along with soldier Qin Shicai, listened carefully to the broadcast and felt genuinely happy from the bottom of their hearts.

The story of the "Three Red" diary is as follows.

In November 1965, She Zhijian, Yang Zhanshan, and Wang Zhiming, three sons of the working people, entered the university together and were assigned to the same class. Amidst the nationwide wave of learning from the great communist warrior Wang Jie, they, with their deep class feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, decided to learn from comrade Wang Jie, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to thoroughly reform their worldview. They voluntarily formed the "Three Red." After that, they persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works, often went to the nearby people's commune to participate in voluntary labor, and recorded their experiences and insights from labor and study in their diaries. Thus, the "Three Red" diary was born.

They wrote the following oath on the first page of their diary: "Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, determined to be good children of Chairman Mao." The three of them helped and learned from each other, as close as brothers.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, they actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call and enthusiastically threw themselves into the stormy struggle of the masses. However, due to the counter-revolutionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, they were divided into two factions and became "enemies." Since then, the "Three Red" diary was discontinued.

After comrades Hou Bing, Xu Shulan of the worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, and soldier Qin Shicai arrived at the Power System's Generation Class 19, they conducted an in-depth investigation and discovered the origins of the "Three Red" diary being discontinued. With a loyal heart to the great leader Chairman Mao, they started from loving and helping the revolutionary youngsters, determined to arm the revolutionary youngsters with Mao Zedong Thought, and to write new chapters for the "Three Red" diary that had been discontinued for more than two years.

At the beginning, the propaganda team members tried to talk to them about their inner thoughts, but they were unwilling to share. They even deliberately avoided the propaganda team members. The propaganda team members, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, talked heart to heart with them again and again. Old worker Hou Bing sincerely told them: "We workers have no other tricks. As long as Chairman Mao says it, we will definitely follow it. You Red Guards made great achievements in the early and middle stages of the Cultural Revolution, but some of you made mistakes in the struggle. We sincerely hope that you will correct them quickly and, together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" The workers' deep proletarian feelings and high sense of responsibility for the revolution deeply moved them. They studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the workers.

To raise the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the students, the worker propaganda team, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "class struggle, grasp it and it works," focused on class education. They launched the "Recall, Reflect, Examine" activity throughout the institute: recalling the bitterness of the old society and the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line; reflecting on the sweetness of the new society and the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; examining one's class struggle consciousness and performance in the Cultural Revolution. The bitter and deep-hating old workers used their blood-stained family history to denounce the evil old society. Comrade Xu Shulan earnestly told them: "Workers built you houses, peasants produced grain for you, soldiers guard the country day and night, and the Party and Chairman Mao sent you to university, all hoping that you will become successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause and become intellectuals welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers. You must make Chairman Mao proud! You should think carefully, who made you 'enemies'? It was the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev! You are class brothers and should unite to direct all your hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev."

The workers' words deeply touched their hearts. They excitedly said, "We are bitter gourds on the same vine. The Chinese Khrushchev is our common enemy. It was his bourgeois reactionary line that made us three brothers part ways; it was the worker class that educated us with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We are determined to reunite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, fight the enemy together, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end!" They formed a "string of red" again, and the "Three Red" diary started again.

    “三人红”日记又重新写起来了
    “在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的热情帮助下，‘三人红’日记又重新写起来了！……”从北京电力学院广播站播出了这个动人的故事。驻学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员侯秉、徐树兰两位师傅和解放军战士秦世才，细心地听着广播，从心眼里感到高兴。
    提起“三人红”日记，还有一段故事。
    一九六五年十一月，佘志坚、杨占山、王志明这三个劳动人民的子弟，一同迈进大学的校门，分配到同一个班学习。在全国人民学习伟大的共产主义战士王杰同志的热潮中，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，下决心向王杰同志学习，活学活用毛主席著作，认真改造自己的世界观。他们自愿结成了“三人红”。这以后，他们坚持学习毛主席著作，经常到学院附近的人民公社参加义务劳动，并把劳动、学习的心得体会记在日记上。“三人红”日记就这样诞生了。
    他们在日记的第一页写下了这样的誓言：永远忠于毛主席，誓做毛主席的好儿女。他们三人互相帮助，互相学习，亲如兄弟。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，他们积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，热情地投身到群众斗争的暴风雨中。但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线，把他们分成了两派，结下了疙瘩，成了“冤家对头”。从此，“三人红”日记也就中断了。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员侯秉、徐树兰和解放军战士秦世才同志来到电力系发电一九班以后，经过深入调查，发现了“三人红”日记停笔的来龙去脉。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的一颗忠心，从爱护和帮助革命小将出发，决心用毛泽东思想武装革命小将，使断了两年多的“三人红”日记续写新的篇章。
    一开始，宣传队的同志找他们谈心，他们都不肯谈自己的活思想。甚至有意识地躲开宣传队的同志。宣传队的同志带着毛主席的最新指示，一次又一次地和他们促膝谈心。老工人侯秉诚恳地对他们说：“我们工人没有什么别的高招，只要是毛主席说了，我们就坚决照办。你们红卫兵小将在文化大革命初期和中期建立了不朽的功绩，但是你们中的一些人在斗争中犯了一些错误。我们诚恳地希望你们迅速改正过来，和工农兵一道将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”工人们深厚的无产阶级感情，对革命高度负责的精神，使他们深受感动。他们和工人一起，认真地学习毛主席的最新指示。
    为了提高同学们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，工人宣传队遵照毛主席的“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的伟大教导，大抓阶级教育，在全院展开了“忆、思、查”活动：忆旧社会的苦、忆资产阶级反动路线的迫害；思新社会的甜和毛主席革命路线的无比正确；查自己的阶级斗争觉悟和在文化大革命中的表现。苦大仇深的老工人，用血泪斑斑的苦难家史，控诉了万恶的旧社会。徐树兰同志语重心长地对他们说：“工人给你们盖好了楼房，农民给你们生产了粮食，解放军日夜保卫着国防，党和毛主席把你们送进了大学，都是希望你们成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，成为工农兵所欢迎的知识分子。你们可要给毛主席争气啊！你们应该好好想一想，是谁把你们变成‘冤家对头’的？是中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线！你们是阶级兄弟，要团结起来，把千仇万恨都集中在中国赫鲁晓夫身上。”
    工人们的一席话，深深地打动了他们的心。他们激动地说，我们是一根藤上的苦瓜，中国赫鲁晓夫是我们共同的敌人，是他推行的资产阶级反动路线，使我们三个亲如兄弟的战友分了家；是工人阶级用战无不胜的毛泽东思想教育了我们，我们决心在毛泽东思想基础上重新团结起来，共同对敌，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！他们又重新结成“一串红”，“三人红”日记就这样又重新写起来了。
