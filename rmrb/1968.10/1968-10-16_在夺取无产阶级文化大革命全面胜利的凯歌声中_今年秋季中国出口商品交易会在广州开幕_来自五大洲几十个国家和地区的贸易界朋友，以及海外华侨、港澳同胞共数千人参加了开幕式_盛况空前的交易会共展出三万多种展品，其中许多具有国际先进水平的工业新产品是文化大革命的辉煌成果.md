The fair, which is unprecedented in scale, showcased over 30,000 items, many of which are industrial new products with advanced international standards, representing the glorious achievements of the cultural revolution.

New China News Agency, Guangzhou, October 15 – In the triumphant march of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the 1968 autumn session of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair opened today in Guangzhou.

This grand fair reflects the unprecedented prosperity and strength of our great socialist motherland. It demonstrates to the world that the great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved great victories in all fields of politics, ideology, economy, and culture in our country. Our socialist construction has entered a new phase of rapid development.

Today, the plaza in front of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair building in the center of Guangzhou is adorned with a giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao. Red balloons float in the sky above the plaza, bearing the giant banners: "Long live Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, invincible!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The plaza is surrounded by flying red flags, and inside, drums and gongs resound, firecrackers explode, and the atmosphere is one of great joy.

In the morning, a grand opening ceremony was held. Thousands of friends from the trade circles of dozens of countries and regions on five continents, as well as overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, attended the ceremony.

Huang Ronghai, Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee, Chairman of the Guangzhou Revolutionary Committee, and Commander of the Guangdong Military Region, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. He emphasized that the great proletarian cultural revolution has brought unprecedented prosperity to our great socialist motherland. Our industrial production has seen continuous successes, and this year our agricultural production has once again yielded a bumper harvest. The urban and rural markets are thriving, and prices are stable. The excellent situation in our national industrial and agricultural production provides a more solid material foundation for further developing and expanding our foreign trade.

Huang Ronghai, in discussing the current favorable international situation, pointed out that a new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun. The conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to re-divide the world will surely meet with complete failure.

Huang Ronghai said that our people will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, better fulfill our internationalist duties. Under the policy of developing friendly trade relations with all countries and regions on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, we will actively promote friendly trade exchanges with the world.

After the opening ceremony, many foreign friends eagerly visited the exhibits.

The fair's 20 exhibition halls showcased over 30,000 items, many of which are industrial new products with advanced international standards, representing the glorious achievements of the cultural revolution. These products vividly demonstrate that our working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is the most intelligent and creative. During the cultural revolution, our working class, with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, followed the great leader Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," and took on the historical mission of the working class leading everything. They firmly grasped the leadership of enterprises and technology, achieving one victory after another. A precision large flat grinding machine with advanced international standards, exhibited in the machinery hall, was designed and manufactured by the workers and technicians of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, relying on the collective wisdom of veteran workers and the broad masses of workers. The 200,000x electron microscope exhibited in the instrumentation hall was successfully manufactured by the workers and young technicians of the Shanghai Institute of Electronic Optics, following the path of self-reliance. This high-level precision instrument is currently only manufactured by a few industrially advanced countries in the world. The new products produced by the methanol plant designed and built by the workers of the chemical industry during the cultural revolution are also exhibited at the fair for the first time. The textile and light industry exhibits, in terms of color, variety, specifications, and quality, have made significant progress compared to the past. Many new products reflect that the production level of our textile and light industries has reached a new height.

The fair also showcased even more abundant grain, oil, food, local specialties, aquatic, and livestock products sent from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. These exhibits demonstrate the thriving scene of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in our rural people's communes.

Tonight, the fair held a reception. The guests and representatives of various trade delegations at the fair totaled over 4,000 people. Huang Ronghai spoke at the reception, wishing the fair a great success. Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Jia Shi also expressed a warm welcome to friends from five continents and overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao at the reception. The atmosphere at the reception was lively throughout, with guests and hosts repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live, long live, ten thousand years!"

After the reception, performances of piano accompaniment to "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women" were staged.

    新华社广州十五日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，一九六八年秋季中国出口商品交易会，今天在广州隆重开幕。
    这次盛况空前的交易会，反映了我们伟大的社会主义祖国空前繁荣强大。它用事实告诉人们：我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已在我国政治、思想、经济、文化等各个领域取得了伟大胜利，我国的社会主义建设事业出现了蒸蒸日上的新的跃进局面。
    今天，中国出口商品交易会大厦所在的广州市中心海珠广场上，竖立着我们伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像。升在广场上空的红色气球，悬挂着巨幅标语：“战无不胜的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”广场四周红旗飘扬，场内锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，一片欢腾。
    上午，交易会举行了隆重的开幕式。来自五大洲几十个国家和地区的贸易界朋友，以及海外华侨、港澳同胞共数千人，参加了开幕式。
    广东省革命委员会副主任、广州市革命委员会主任、广东省军区司令员黄荣海在开幕式上讲话。他强调说，无产阶级文化大革命给我们伟大的社会主义祖国，带来了日新月异的繁荣景象。我国工业生产捷报频传，我国农业生产今年又是一个丰收年景。城乡市场繁荣，物价稳定。全国工农业生产的大好形势，为进一步发展和扩大我国的对外贸易提供了更加雄厚的物质基础。
    黄荣海在谈到当前大好的国际形势时指出，一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经开始，美帝、苏修互相勾结，妄图重新瓜分世界的阴谋，必将遭到彻底的破产。
    黄荣海说，我国人民将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在毛主席的革命路线指引下，更好地履行自己的国际主义义务，在平等互利，互通有无的对外贸易政策指导下，积极同世界各国各地区发展友好贸易往来。
    开幕式结束后，许多外国朋友踊跃参观展出的展品。
    交易会的二十个展览馆，共展出了三万多种展品，其中许多具有国际先进水平的工业新产品，是无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果，这些产品生动地说明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国工人阶级最有智慧，最有创造能力。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国工人阶级发挥冲天的革命干劲，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，担负起了工人阶级必须领导一切的历史使命，牢牢掌握了企业和技术的领导大权，取得了一个又一个胜利。在机械大厅展出的一台具有国际先进水平的精密大型平面磨床，是由上海机床厂的工人技术员担任主任设计师，依靠老工人和广大工人群众的集体智慧设计制造出来的。仪器大厅展出的二十万倍电子显微镜，是上海电子光学研究所的工人和青年技术人员，走自力更生的道路制造成功的。这种高级精密仪器目前世界上只有少数工业发达国家能够制造。我国化学工业工人在文化大革命中自己设计建造的甲醇车间生产的新产品，也在交易会上第一次展出。纺织工业和轻工业展品无论花色、品种规格和质量都比过去有很大发展，许多新产品反映了我国纺织工业和轻工业的生产水平，已经达到了一个新的高度。
    交易会还展出了全国各省、市、自治区送来的比过去更加丰富的粮油食品、土特产、水产和畜产品。这些展品，展现了我国农村人民公社农、林、牧、副、渔业的一片兴旺景象。
    今天晚上，交易会举行了招待会，参加招待会的来宾和交易会各交易团的代表共有四千多人。黄荣海在招待会上讲话，预祝这次交易会成功。我国对外贸易部副部长贾石也在会上向来自五大洲的朋友和海外华侨、港澳同胞表示热烈的欢迎。招待会自始至终气氛热烈，宾主不断高呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
