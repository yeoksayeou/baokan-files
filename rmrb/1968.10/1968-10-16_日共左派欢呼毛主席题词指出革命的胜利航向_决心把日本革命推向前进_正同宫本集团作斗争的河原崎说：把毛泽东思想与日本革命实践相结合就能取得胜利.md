Japanese Communist Leftists Hail Chairman Mao's Inscription Pointing Out the Victorious Course of Revolution

Determined to Advance the Japanese Revolution

Kawahara, who is engaged in a struggle against the Miyamoto faction, says: Combining Mao Zedong Thought with Japanese revolutionary practice will lead to victory

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Tokyo: A member of the Aichi Prefectural Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party, Isa Masayoshi, said: Six years ago, Chairman Mao inscribed a brilliant message to Japanese workers, clearly pointing out the victorious course of the Japanese revolution.

Isa pointed out that what we particularly need at present is to earnestly study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution, and to advance the Japanese revolution.

Isa said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism's revolutionary theory and style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

Isa said, we are striving to build a proletarian revolutionary party in Japan according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

A responsible person from the Kyoto branch of the Japanese Communist Party (Left), Hiraoka Kazuo, said that the revolutionary leftists in Kyoto have decided to make Chairman Mao's brilliant inscription a top priority for study, to study it seriously, and to apply it to the fierce struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Tokyo: Kawahara Shichiro, a famous Japanese actor who is resolutely fighting against the persecution by the Miyamoto revisionist faction of the Japanese Communist Party, said in a speech at a mass rally on the 4th: We must combine Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution, and in this way, we will definitely achieve victory.

On the evening of the 4th, the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), and the Japan International Trade Promotion Association held a meeting in Tokyo to firmly support the struggle of the cultural warrior Kawahara Shichiro, who has rebelled against the Miyamoto revisionist faction of the Japanese Communist Party. More than 400 people from various circles in Tokyo attended the meeting.

In his speech, Kawahara highly praised the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, which thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters represented by China's Khrushchev, further strengthened and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said, the great proletarian cultural revolution in China is a great political and ideological revolution, which has extremely profound and immeasurable great significance. Kawahara said, this great revolution not only has a great impact on Japan but also on the whole world.

Kawahara said with revolutionary fervor, in order to achieve true independence and prosperity for Japan, we must combine Mao Zedong Thought with the specific practice of the Japanese revolution, and in this way, we will definitely achieve victory. Kawahara finally shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

Representatives from various circles in Japan, Shiraishi Banzan, Nakajima Takeshige, Ito Takeshi, Kawase Ikkan, Shimizu Masao, and Sakamoto Tokumatsu, all spoke at the meeting. They enthusiastically praised Kawahara's revolutionary spirit and brave actions in rebelling against the Miyamoto revisionist faction of the Japanese Communist Party.

    正同宫本集团作斗争的河原崎说：把毛泽东思想与日本革命实践相结合就能取得胜利
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本共产党爱知县委员会（左派）常务委员伊佐雅正说：毛主席六年前书赠日本工人朋友们的光辉题词，明确地指出了日本革命的胜利航向。
    伊佐指出，当前我们感到特别需要的是，进一步认真地努力活学活用毛泽东思想，把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想与日本革命的具体实践结合起来，把日本革命推向前进。
    伊佐说，毛主席教导我们：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”
    伊佐说，我们正在按照毛主席的教导，为在日本建立无产阶级的革命党而努力。
    日本共产党（左派）京都地方的负责人平冈和夫说，京都的革命左派已经决定把毛主席的这一光辉题词作为头等重要的学习文件，认真学习，并且应用到同帝修反进行的激烈的斗争中去。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：正在同日共宫本修正主义集团的迫害进行坚决斗争的日本著名演员河原崎长十郎，四日在一次群众集会上发表讲话说，我们必须把毛泽东思想与日本革命的具体实践结合起来，这样我们就一定能够取得胜利。

    河原崎在讲话中，高度赞扬伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，彻底打垮了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级司令部，进一步加强和巩固了无产阶级专政。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场伟大的政治革命和思想革命，它具有非常深远的不可估量的伟大意义。河原崎说，这一场大革命不仅对日本，而且对全世界发生着巨大影响。
    河原崎满怀革命豪情地说，为了争取日本真正的独立和繁荣，我们必须把毛泽东思想与日本革命的具体实践结合起来，这样我们就一定能够取得胜利。河原崎最后高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
