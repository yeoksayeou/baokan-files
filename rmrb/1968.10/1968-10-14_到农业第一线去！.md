    To the Front Lines of Agriculture!

    On September 14, the night was already deep, but the discussion in the dormitory of the workers' propaganda team had not yet ceased.

    "You should go back and have your meal. We will discuss it tomorrow and give you an answer," said the team leader.

    "No, I need an answer now. If it's not approved, I won't eat tonight!" replied Wang Chenzhong.

    What exactly happened? Let's start from the beginning.

    Under the inspiration of the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao on re-educating intellectuals, many graduates from Luoyang No. 19 Middle School actively signed up to go to the mountains and countryside, settle down in rural areas, and follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants. However, at a critical moment, the leader of Class 3, Group 6, Wang Chenzhong, began to hesitate.

    Following Chairman Mao's instructions to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, which is a very good method," workers from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, including veteran worker Chen Changfu, had several heart-to-heart talks with Wang Chenzhong. They quickly became good friends. Once, Old Chen sincerely asked Xiao Wang, "You are the leader of the revolutionary rebels, why don't you take the lead in signing up to go to the mountains and countryside?" Xiao Wang replied, "Revolutionary rebels should be taken care of, right? Let the old conservatives go to the countryside."

    Old Chen heard this and realized that Xiao Wang had been deeply poisoned by the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. He seriously said to Xiao Wang, "Xiao Wang! You are Chairman Mao's Red Guard. Don't be fooled by the class enemy! Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, 'We Communists are not seeking official posts, but are seeking to carry out revolution.' Think about it, are you a revolutionary rebel fighter, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, or are you seeking conditions for yourself in the graduation allocation?" These words made Xiao Wang lower his head in shame, and he finally admitted his mistake and exposed the reactionary remarks spread by the school's capitalist roaders that "leaders of the revolutionary rebels should be taken care of."

    The next day, under Old Chen's guidance, the whole class launched a fierce criticism and denunciation of China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line and conducted a face-to-face struggle session against the capitalist roaders in the school. Xiao Wang stepped onto the platform and said, "Chairman Mao tells us to take the path of integrating with workers and peasants. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words. Wherever Chairman Mao points, I will go there. I will definitely sign up to go to the front lines of agriculture, to roll in the mud, and to forge a heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao!" The meeting hall boiled over. "Learn from Wang Chenzhong!" "Firmly support Wang Chenzhong's revolutionary actions!" "Follow Chairman Mao and firmly go to the countryside!" The slogans echoed endlessly.

    It was late at night. Old Chen, without having his dinner, took two steamed buns, got on his bike, and rushed to Wang Chenzhong's home. To understand the situation of the students' parents and to coordinate with them, Old Chen had already visited the homes of every student in the class. Now, this was his third visit to Wang Chenzhong's home. With Old Chen's patient help, Xiao Wang's entire family actively supported him in going to the mountains and countryside. However, Xiao Wang was not approved. On the list of honor for the first batch of 78 urban youth going to Lingbao to settle down, there was no name of Xiao Wang. How could this not make him anxious?

    This is the reason why Xiao Wang insisted on going to the mountains and countryside.

    Recently, Wang Chenzhong was finally approved to go to the countryside, realizing his revolutionary ideal. Old Chen presented a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to Xiao Wang, who excitedly pinned a shining Mao badge onto Old Chen's chest. With the help of the workers, Xiao Wang and his classmates triumphantly embarked on a new journey.

    到农业第一线去！
    九月十四日，夜已经很深了，工人宣传队住室里一场激烈的争论仍未停止。
    “你快回去吃饭吧，明天我们研究以后答复你。”这是宣传队指导员的声音。
    “不行，现在就要答复。不批准，今天我就不吃饭！”这是王晨钟同学的声音。
    究竟发生了什么事呢？这得从头说起。
    在伟大领袖毛主席最近发出关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示的鼓舞下，洛阳十九中许多毕业生积极报名上山下乡，到农村安家落户，走同工农相结合的道路。可是，三年级六班的头头王晨钟，在节骨眼上有些退缩。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员、老工人陈长福，遵照毛主席关于“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，跟王晨钟同学进行了多次谈心，很快地就成了小王最好的朋友。一次，老陈非常诚恳地问小王：“你是革命造反派头头，为什么不带头报名上山下乡？”小王却回答说：“革命造反派应该照顾照顾嘛！叫老保下农村去。”老陈一听，知道小王中了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒不浅，便语重心长地对他说：“小王啊！你是毛主席的红卫兵，可不要上了阶级敌人的当啊！伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，‘我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命’。你想想，你是革命造反派战士，是为了保卫毛主席革命路线，还是为了给自己在毕业分配中争条件呢？”一席话把小王说得羞愧地低下了头，他终于承认了错误，并揭发了学校走资派散布的“造反派头头应当照顾”的反动言论。
    第二天，在老陈的推动下，全班同学对中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线进行了狠狠的揭发和批判，并对学校里的走资派，进行了面对面的批斗。小王走上讲台说：“毛主席让我们走同工农相结合的路，我坚决听毛主席的话，毛主席指向那里，我就打到那里，我坚决报名到农业第一线去，去滚一身泥巴，去炼一颗永远忠于毛主席的红心！”会场沸腾起来了。“向王晨钟同学学习！”“坚决支持王晨钟同学的革命行动！”“紧跟毛主席，坚决到农村！”口号声经久不息。
    天很晚了，老陈顾不上吃晚饭，拿了两个馒头，骑上车子就向王晨钟家里飞去。为了了解学生家长的情况，与家长取得配合，老陈早已跑遍了班里每个同学的家。现在，他已是第三次去王晨钟家里了。在老陈的耐心帮助下，小王全家都积极支持他上山下乡。可是小王却没有被批准，首批七十八名城市知识青年到灵宝安家落户的光荣榜上，没有小王的名字。这怎能不叫他着急呢？
    这就是小王坚决要求上山下乡的原因。
    最近，王晨钟同学终于被批准下乡了，他实现了自己的革命理想。老陈把一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》双手捧给小王，小王激动地把一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章别到老陈的胸前。小王和他的同学在工人们的帮助下，胜利地走上了新的征途。
