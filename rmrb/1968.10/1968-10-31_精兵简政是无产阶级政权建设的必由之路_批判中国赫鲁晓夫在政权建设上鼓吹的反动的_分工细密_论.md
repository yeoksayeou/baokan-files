The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power. The principles by which to build state power are determined by the class nature of different countries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." This great directive profoundly expounds on the fundamental difference between proletarian state power and bourgeois state power.

The state power of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes is the power of a minority of exploiters ruling and suppressing the broad masses of the people. They enslave, exploit, and oppress the people, so they must establish a vast ruling apparatus to suppress the masses. Such an apparatus must inevitably be a bureaucratic structure with overlapping layers, complex organizations, and mutual checks. Bureaucratic organizations are the inevitable products of the state power of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes.

The state power of the proletariat is the power of the people, serving the people. Its fundamental task is to protect the broad masses of the people and suppress a handful of class enemies. The masses are the source of strength for proletarian state power. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the broad revolutionary masses participate in the management of the state and exercise revolutionary supervision over the state power at all levels from the bottom up. The essence of proletarian state power requires it to be closely connected with the masses, to rely firmly on the masses, and to be deeply rooted among the masses. Therefore, it is fundamentally incompatible with a vast bureaucratic apparatus.

As early as 1942, the great leader Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "The policy of streamlining and simplifying the government proposed by the Party Central Committee is a very important policy." "In this round of streamlining and simplifying, we must achieve the five goals of streamlining, unification, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucratism." Chairman Mao recently instructed that the revolutionary committees should follow the path of "streamlining and simplifying." The editorial note in the July 11, 1968, issue of the People's Daily pointed out: "If the majority of revolutionary committees can handle the two tasks of purging class ranks and implementing streamlining and simplifying well, they will consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of organization."

The revolutionary committees at all levels implement streamlining and simplifying and achieve revolutionization, which can firmly and unshakably carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strengthen proletarian dictatorship, lead the broad masses of the people, and carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end. This is of great significance in opposing revisionism and preventing capitalist restoration.

The Chinese Khrushchev, out of his counter-revolutionary needs, has consistently opposed streamlining and simplifying. He advocates: "The more people there are, the larger the organization, the more complex it will be." He puts forward a fallacious theory of "detailed division of labor" as the "theoretical basis" for opposing streamlining and simplifying. He says: "From single-celled organisms to higher animals is development. The higher the animal, the more detailed the division of labor in its cells. Today, everything has a division of labor, and the division of labor should be scientific and clear, not confused." This is a set of reactionary "theories" that corrupt the proletarian state power. According to his theory of "detailed division of labor," the more the state power develops, the more "detailed the division of labor" should be, and the state apparatus can only become more complex, more bloated, and more cumbersome. Isn't this precisely the opposite of the path of streamlining and simplifying?!

Streamlining and simplifying is what the class nature of proletarian dictatorship requires.

Proletarian dictatorship, unlike the bourgeois dictatorship where a handful of exploiters suppress the broad masses of the people, is the dictatorship of the broad laboring masses under the leadership of the working class and its party over a handful of class enemies. Proletarian dictatorship is the dictatorship of the masses. The task of proletarian state power must firmly rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and launch mass movements to complete it. As long as the masses are fully mobilized, a handful of class enemies will be surrounded by the people on all sides and will be subjected to the most effective and practical dictatorship. Therefore, although the proletariat also needs special organs to suppress a handful of class enemies within the country, these organs should not be as bloated and cumbersome as those in capitalist countries but should be very streamlined. Only then can they be closely connected with the masses and fully exert the power of mass dictatorship.

The proletarian dictatorship has the heavy task of organizing and leading socialist construction. However, construction must also be led by politics and must mobilize and rely on the broad masses to launch mass movements. The establishment of relevant leading organs of the state and the development of work must adhere to the spirit of the whole country as one chessboard and must take as the starting point how to be closely connected with the masses, convenient for mass supervision, and fully exert the role of the masses. This requires that these organs be streamlined, the cadres be servants of the people who are among the masses, not bureaucrats high above, the organs be streamlined, the command be flexible, and the efficiency be high, not bloated and cumbersome bureaucratic organs.

To excellently complete its great historical mission, the most fundamental thing for the organs of proletarian state power is to highlight proletarian politics, focus on class struggle, arm the broad masses of the people with Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To achieve this, it is necessary to implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, and achieve strict streamlining and simplifying. Because only by streamlining and simplifying can Chairman Mao's voice be transmitted the fastest, can the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin be carried out the most powerfully, can the broad cadres' thoughts be revolutionized the most effectively, and can a revolutionary leadership cadre closely connected with the masses truly be organized.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." Overlapping administrative organs and cumbersome layers of checkpoints will inevitably separate the organs of proletarian state power from the broad masses of the people, greatly hindering the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. Only by streamlining and simplifying can we better "directly rely on the broad revolutionary masses of the people," fully exert the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, effectively carry out mass dictatorship over a handful of class enemies, and make all our work lively and thriving.

The "detailed division of labor" theory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev completely negates the class nature of proletarian state power and its fundamental style of closely connecting with the masses, and is completely contrary to the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought on the construction of proletarian state power.

The "detailed division of labor" theory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is a reactionary fallacy that opposes highlighting proletarian politics and implementing "business as usual." The more detailed the division of labor, the more it will lead to "each managing their own business," "each managing what is under their eyes," turning around in the office and piles of work, unable to extricate themselves, seriously alienating from reality, alienating from the masses, and alienating from class struggle. It will inevitably lead to only highlighting business and not politics. The more detailed the division of labor, the more it will only value and believe in the so-called "experts," not believe in and rely on the broad masses of the people, but rather "manage" the masses, "control" the masses, "press" the masses, and suppress the revolutionary initiative of the masses. The more detailed the division of labor, the more it will inevitably lead to overlapping organs, mutual pulling, low efficiency, and turn the revolutionary state power of the proletariat into a breeding ground for bureaucratism.

The "detailed division of labor" theory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is a reactionary fallacy that abolishes the highly centralized and unified leadership of the proletariat. The more detailed the division of labor, the more it will inevitably lead to "each doing their own thing," forming their own systems and teams. It will inevitably lead to each having their own direct superior, each having their own plans, each acting on their own, and each doing their own thing. It will inevitably lead to dispersionism, forming "multiple centers" or "no center," seriously hindering the implementation of the orders and instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, destroying centralized and unified leadership, and even causing factions and independent kingdoms. It is precisely under the reactionary theory of "detailed division of labor" that the Chinese Khrushchev sets up bloated organs, creates overlapping layers, and conveniently recruits traitors, forms factions, and places a handful of traitors, spies, and capitalist roaders in some regions and departments to create large and small independent kingdoms, attempting to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and replace it.

The "detailed division of labor" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev is a reactionary fallacy that creates a privileged class. According to this theory, the state organs will inevitably become more and more bloated, more and more cadres will be detached from production, there will only be those who come up to be "officials," and none who go down to serve the people, people will be redundant, high above, act like officials, detached from reality, detached from labor, detached from the masses, gradually "peacefully evolve," and gradually form a privileged class.

In summary, the "detailed division of labor" theory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is to oppose streamlining and simplifying and to oppose taking the revolutionary path; it is to turn the organs of proletarian state power into bloated, complex, and overlapping bureaucratic organs; it is to build high walls and layers of checkpoints, hollow out the proletarian state power, make it high above, detached from the masses; it is to poison cadres, develop bureaucratism, dispersionism, and factionalism, cultivate a revisionist privileged class that rides on the heads of the people. In a word, it is to attempt to turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship and turn the organs of proletarian state power into revisionist state power organs.

In the stormy mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class and the people created the revolutionary committees with the "three-in-one combination." The great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the revolutionary committees are an important part of the great theory of continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship and a major development of Marxist-Leninist state theory. The birth of the revolutionary committees thoroughly smashed the Chinese Khrushchev's evil conspiracy to promote revisionism and set up bureaucratic organs in state building. The revolutionary committees with the "three-in-one combination" have a deep mass foundation and inherently have the superior conditions to connect with the masses, can most quickly reflect the emotions, opinions, interests, and experiences of the masses, and can most quickly convey and most resolutely carry out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters. The revolutionary committees with the "three-in-one combination" are a new thing with great vitality that has appeared on the eastern horizon. Under the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they are constantly consolidating and developing in the great waves of class struggle, and they are advancing victoriously on the great road of "streamlining and simplifying" as instructed by Chairman Mao, increasingly playing a great revolutionary role as the command center leading the broad revolutionary masses to win new victories.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The state system and laws of people's democratic dictatorship, and the socialist ideology guided by Marxism-Leninism, these superstructures have played an active role in the victory of our socialist transformation and the establishment of socialist labor organization. They are consistent with the socialist economic base, that is, socialist production relations; but the existence of bourgeois ideology, certain bureaucratic tendencies in state organs, and certain defects in the state system are also in contradiction with the socialist economic base." This tells us: because the old ideology, old habits, and old styles of the exploiting class cannot be eliminated all at once, the newly established organs of proletarian state power will inevitably be influenced by them, and thus will be both consistent and contradictory with the socialist economic base. The proletariat must constantly overcome the contradictions between the superstructure and the economic base to promote the development of socialism. To solve these contradictions, it is necessary to constantly reform the state organs and constantly "criticize the bourgeoisie" to eliminate the old influences of the exploiting class. Such reforms will inevitably be sabotaged by a handful of class enemies and will encounter resistance from conservatism and old habits. Therefore, after the proletariat seizes state power, smashes the old reactionary state machine, and establishes the organs of proletarian state power, it must continue to reform and continue the revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees has three points: one is the presence of revolutionary cadres, one is the presence of military representatives, and one is the presence of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and simplify, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre closely connected with the masses." Streamlining and simplifying is an important part of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on the construction of proletarian state power and is the inevitable path for the construction of proletarian state power. Whether or not to take the path of streamlining and simplifying is not a technical issue of reducing some people or some organs but is a sharp and intense struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev in state building. This struggle is essentially a struggle between the proletariat to consolidate and develop proletarian dictatorship and the bourgeoisie to overthrow proletarian dictatorship; it is a struggle between the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to consolidate and develop the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the class enemies to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fail halfway.

Streamlining and simplifying is also a great ideological revolution to overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness. It deeply touches the souls of the broad cadres. The broad cadres must thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence of the exploiting class that despises the masses and looks down on labor, thoroughly purge the poison of the revisionist line of state building of the Chinese Khrushchev, establish the worldview of the proletariat that is closely connected with the masses, be good servants of the people, and diligently serve the people, and carry out a profound ideological revolution, so that "streamlining and simplifying" can truly be "strict, thorough, and universal, not perfunctory, half-hearted, and partial," and can carry out the revolution in the construction of proletarian state power to the end.

The great leader Chairman Mao has long taught: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people." Cadres should "be both 'officials' and ordinary people." Recently, he has also taught: "The broad cadres going down to labor is a very good opportunity for them to re-learn. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, they should all do this. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." This is the greatest concern, greatest trust, greatest education, and greatest encouragement for the broad cadres, and is the guiding light for the thought revolutionization of the broad cadres. Let us closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in state building, and strive forward for the realization of streamlining and simplifying and the thought revolutionization of cadres!

    精兵简政是无产阶级政权建设的必由之路
    ——批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设上鼓吹的反动的“分工细密”论
    装甲兵机关　永忠东
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。按照什么原则建设政权，这是由各种国家不同的阶级本质决定的。
    毛主席教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”这个伟大指示，深刻地阐述了无产阶级政权同资产阶级政权的根本区别。
    资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政权都是少数剥削者统治和镇压广大人民群众的政权。他们奴役人民、剥削人民、压迫人民，因此，就要建立庞大的统治机构来镇压人民群众。这样的机构必然是层次重叠、机构庞杂、互相牵制的官僚机构。官僚机构是资产阶级和一切剥削阶级政权的必然产物。
    无产阶级的政权是人民的政权，是为人民服务的。它的根本任务是保护广大人民群众，镇压一小撮阶级敌人。人民群众是无产阶级政权力量的源泉。在无产阶级专政条件下，广大革命群众参加国家的管理，对各级政权机构实行自下而上的革命监督。无产阶级政权的本质，要求它必须最密切地联系群众，最坚决地依靠群众，深深地扎根于群众之中。因此，它与庞大的官僚机构是根本不相容的。
    伟大领袖毛主席早在一九四二年就明确指出：“党中央提出的精兵简政的政策，是一个极其重要的政策。”“在这次精兵简政中，必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的。”毛主席最近又指示，革命委员会要走“精兵简政”的道路。一九六八年七月十一日《人民日报》编者按指出：“如果大多数的革命委员会把清理阶级队伍、实行精兵简政这两件工作抓好了，就是从组织上巩固和发展了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。”
    各级革命委员会实行精兵简政，实现革命化，就能坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，强化无产阶级专政，带领广大人民群众，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。这对于反对修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，具有极为重要的意义。
    中国赫鲁晓夫出于他反革命的需要，一贯竭力反对精兵简政。他鼓吹什么：“人多了，机构大了，组织就要复杂点。”他提出一种“分工细密”的谬论，作为反对精兵简政的“理论根据”。他说：“从单细胞到高级动物是发展，越是到高级动物，细胞的分工越细密。我们今天一切都有分工，分工要科学，明确，不能混淆。”这是一套腐蚀无产阶级政权的反动“理论”。按照他这种“分工细密”论，政权越是发展，就要“分工越细密”，政权机构就只能越来越复杂，越来越庞大，越来越臃肿。这不是恰恰与精兵简政走完全相反的道路吗？！
    精兵简政，是无产阶级专政的阶级本质所要求的。
    无产阶级专政，同一小撮剥削者镇压广大人民群众的资产阶级专政国家相反，是广大劳动人民在工人阶级及其政党领导下对一小撮阶级敌人的专政。无产阶级专政是群众的专政。无产阶级政权的任务，必须坚决依靠群众，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动来完成。只要充分发动了群众，一小撮阶级敌人就会陷入人民群众的层层包围之中，就会受到最切实最有效的专政。因此，无产阶级为了镇压国内一小撮阶级敌人，虽然也需要专门机构，但这种机构不应象资本主义国家那样臃肿庞大，而应该非常精干，这样才有利于紧密联系群众，充分发挥群众专政的威力。
    无产阶级专政的国家，负有组织领导社会主义建设的重大任务。但是，搞建设同样必须政治挂帅，必须发动和依靠广大群众，大搞群众运动。国家有关领导机构的设立，工作的开展，必须本着全国一盘棋的精神，必须以如何有利于密切联系群众、便于群众监督、充分发挥群众的作用为出发点。这就要求这些机构兵要精，政要简，要求干部是深入群众的人民勤务员，而不是高高在上的官僚主义者，要求机构是精干的，指挥是灵活的，是具有高度效率的，而不是臃肿庞大的官僚主义机构。
    无产阶级的政权机构，要出色地完成自己的伟大历史任务，最根本的一条，就是突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，用毛泽东思想武装广大人民群众，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线。要做到这一点，就必须实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，实现严格的精兵简政。因为，只有兵精政简，才能最迅速地传达毛主席的声音，才能最有力地贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，才能最有效地促使广大干部思想革命化，才能真正“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”重叠的行政机构，烦琐的层层关卡，必然会把无产阶级的政权机构同广大人民群众隔离开来，极大地妨碍了广大人民群众革命积极性的发挥。只有兵精政简，才能更好地“直接依靠广大革命人民群众”，才能充分发挥广大群众的革命积极性，才能对一小撮阶级敌人实行最有效的群众专政，才能把我们的各项工作都办得生气勃勃，蒸蒸日上。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“分工细密”论，完全抹煞了无产阶级政权的阶级性及其紧密联系群众的根本作风，与马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于无产阶级政权建设的理论完全背道而驰。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“分工细密”论，是反对突出无产阶级政治，实行“业务挂帅”的反动谬论。这种分工越细密，必然会造成我管我的，你管你的，各自只管眼睛底下的那一点业务，在办公室里、事务堆中转来转去，不能自拔，严重地脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离阶级斗争。它必然形成只突出业务，不突出政治。这种分工越细密，就必然会只重视和相信所谓“专家”的作用，不相信和依靠广大人民群众，反而是“管”群众，“卡”群众，“压”群众，压制群众的革命首创精神。这种分工越细密，必然会形成机构重叠，互相扯皮，效能很低，使无产阶级的革命政权变成产生官僚主义的温床。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“分工细密”论，是取消无产阶级高度的集中统一领导的反动谬论。这种分工越细密，就必然形成“敲锣卖糖，各干一行”，自成系统，自有班子。就必然各有各的顶头上司，各有各的打算，各自为政，各行其是。就必然产生分散主义，形成“多中心”即“无中心”，严重地妨碍以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的命令、指示的贯彻执行，破坏集中统一的领导，甚至造成山头，搞独立王国。中国赫鲁晓夫正是在“分工细密”的反动理论下，设置臃肿机构，制造重叠层次，便于他招降纳叛，结党营私，安插一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派，在一些地区和部门搞大大小小的独立王国，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，取而代之。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“分工细密”论，是一种制造特权阶层的反动谬论。按照这种理论，政权机构必然越来越庞大，脱离生产的干部越来越多，只有上来当“官”的，没有下去为民的，人浮于事，高高在上，做官当老爷，脱离实际，脱离劳动，脱离群众，逐步地“和平演变”，逐步地形成为一个特权阶层。
    总之，中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的这套“分工细密”论，就是反对精兵简政，反对走革命化的道路；就是要把无产阶级政权机构变成臃肿庞杂、层次重叠的官僚机构；就是要筑起道道高墙、层层关卡，把无产阶级政权架空起来，使之高高在上，脱离群众；就是要毒害干部，发展官僚主义、分散主义、山头主义，培养骑在人民头上的修正主义特权阶层。一句话，他就是妄图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，变无产阶级政权机构为修正主义政权机构。
    在无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的暴风雨中，工人阶级和人民群众创造了“三结合”的革命委员会。伟大领袖毛主席关于革命委员会的一系列最新指示，是关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的伟大理论的重要组成部分，是对马克思列宁主义国家学说的重大发展。革命委员会的诞生，彻底摧垮了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设上推行修正主义，设置官僚机构的罪恶阴谋。“三结合”的革命委员会，有着深厚的群众基础，本身就具有联系群众的优越条件，能够最迅速地反映群众的情绪、意见、利益和经验，能够最快地传达和最坚决地贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的战斗号令。“三结合”的革命委员会是东方地平线上出现的具有强大生命力的新事物，它正在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里不断巩固和发展，它正在毛主席指示的“精兵简政”的伟大道路上胜利前进，越来越发挥出作为带领广大革命群众夺取新胜利的战斗指挥部的巨大革命作用。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民民主专政的国家制度和法律，以马克思列宁主义为指导的社会主义意识形态，这些上层建筑对于我国社会主义改造的胜利和社会主义劳动组织的建立起了积极的推动作用，它是和社会主义的经济基础即社会主义的生产关系相适应的；但是，资产阶级意识形态的存在，国家机构中某些官僚主义作风的存在，国家制度中某些环节上缺陷的存在，又是和社会主义的经济基础相矛盾的。”这就告诉我们：因为剥削阶级的旧思想意识、旧习惯势力、旧作风并不是一下子可以消灭的，新建立起来的无产阶级的政权机构必然会受到它们的影响，因而和社会主义的经济基础是又相适应又相矛盾的。无产阶级只有不断克服上层建筑同经济基础之间存在的那些矛盾，才能推动社会主义的发展。要解决这些矛盾，就要不断地改革政权机构，不断地“批判资产阶级”，清除剥削阶级的旧影响。这种改革又必然会遭到一小撮阶级敌人的破坏，并遭到保守主义和旧习惯势力的抵抗，斗争一定会反复进行。因此，无产阶级夺取了政权，打碎了旧的反动国家机器，建立起无产阶级政权机构以后，还必须不断改革，不断革命。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”精兵简政，是毛主席关于无产阶级政权建设的光辉思想的重要组成部分，是无产阶级政权建设的必由之路。走不走精兵简政的道路，决不是一个减少一些人或减少一些机构的技术问题，而是毛主席的革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线在政权建设上的一场尖锐激烈的斗争。这场斗争，实质上是无产阶级要巩固和发展无产阶级专政，同资产阶级要颠覆无产阶级专政的斗争；是无产阶级和广大革命人民群众要巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，同阶级敌人要使无产阶级文化大革命半途夭折的斗争。
    精兵简政，同时也是一场破私立公的思想大革命。它深刻地触动广大干部的灵魂。广大干部要彻底清除轻视群众、鄙视劳动的剥削阶级思想影响，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义政权建设路线的流毒，树立起密切联系群众，当好人民勤务员，勤勤恳恳为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，进行一场深刻的思想大革命，才能使“精兵简政”真正做到“是严格的、彻底的、普遍的，而不是敷衍的、不痛不痒的、局部的”，才能把无产阶级政权建设上的革命进行到底。
    伟大领袖毛主席早就教导说：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”干部要“既当‘官’，又当老百姓。”最近他老人家又教导说：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”这是对广大干部的最大关怀、最大信任、最大教育、最大鞭策，是实现广大干部思想革命化的指路明灯。让我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设上的反革命修正主义路线，为实现精兵简政和干部思想革命化而奋勇前进！
