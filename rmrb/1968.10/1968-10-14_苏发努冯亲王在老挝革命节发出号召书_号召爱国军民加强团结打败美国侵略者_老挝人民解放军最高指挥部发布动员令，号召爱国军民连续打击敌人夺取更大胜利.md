Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued a call to the Lao patriotic armed forces and the people of the whole country on the occasion of the Lao Revolution Day, calling on the Lao patriotic military and people to further strengthen their unity and carry the anti-American national salvation struggle to the final victory.

The call warmly congratulates the Lao patriotic military and people on their brilliant victories in the anti-American national salvation struggle.

The call points out that the great victories won by the Lao patriotic military and people on the battlefield have put the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys in an even more failed and passive position militarily and politically. The Lao patriotic armed forces have made a leap forward in their struggle, the liberated areas have been further consolidated, and the revolutionary spirit of the Lao patriotic military and people is surging.

The call says that although the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys have suffered heavy defeats, they have not yet abandoned their aggressive ambitions and are trying to intensify their aggression against our country. At this moment, our people throughout the country must further heighten their vigilance and continue to strengthen the struggle until the final victory is won.

The call says that the Lao people love peace very much, but as long as our country has not yet obtained true independence and freedom, we cannot enjoy true peace.

The call points out that the period ahead will be a time of very fierce struggle for the Lao people. The call calls on the Lao people and patriotic armed forces to further strengthen their unity, strengthen their iron will to defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, redouble their efforts, forge ahead courageously, seize the opportunity and win victories.

The call finally says that we will definitely win, and the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys are doomed to failure.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Kan Khoe, October 12, according to the Pathet Lao News Agency, the General Headquarters of the Lao People's Liberation Army issued a mobilization order on October 5 to the cadres and soldiers of the main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units throughout the country, calling on the Lao patriotic military and people to advance bravely in the upcoming dry season, take the initiative, continuously strike the enemy, and win greater victories.

The mobilization order mentions that after the Lao patriotic military and people achieved great victories of strategic significance in the 1967-1968 dry season, the country is now at a crucial moment in the anti-American national salvation struggle. To meet the requirements of history and the situation, the General Headquarters of the Lao People's Liberation Army orders all main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units throughout the country to carry forward the spirit of taking the initiative, continuously and fiercely striking the enemy, overcoming all difficulties and hardships, and annihilating the enemy's maximum number of living forces; shooting down more enemy aircraft; assisting all ethnic peoples to break free from the shackles of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, striving to do a good job of propaganda among the masses, and establishing and developing close and united relations between the military and the people; striving to promote the work of dissolving the rightist army and bandits in Laos; while fighting, building the army in all aspects such as politics and ideology, so that the patriotic armed forces will be more victorious and stronger in battle.
