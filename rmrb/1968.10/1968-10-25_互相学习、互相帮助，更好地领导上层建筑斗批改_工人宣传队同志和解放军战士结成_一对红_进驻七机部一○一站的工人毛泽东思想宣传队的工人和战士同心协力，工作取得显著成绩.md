Workers' propaganda teams and PLA soldiers form "red pairs" to better lead the struggle to criticize and transform the superstructure

Workers from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the 101 Station of the Seventh Machinery Department and soldiers from the Beijing Military Region's certain unit's Machine Gun Third Company have formed "red pairs" to work together, achieving remarkable results.

According to Xinhua News Agency, soldiers from the Machine Gun Third Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region, who are stationed with the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team at the 101 Station, have paired up with the propaganda team's workers to carry out "red pair" activities. This not only helps soldiers and workers learn from each other, care for each other, and help each other, promoting the revolutionization of their thinking, but also strengthens military-civilian unity. Together, they lead the revolutionary masses at the station to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the 101 Station is composed of a group of outstanding workers. The military unit supporting this propaganda team is a heroic unit that has been rated as a "four-good" unit for seven consecutive years. These workers and soldiers, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, have expressed their determination to learn from each other as soon as they joined forces. The soldiers studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "Our country has a population of 700 million, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all other work." They decided to take the working class as an example and speed up the revolutionization of their thinking. The workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "The whole country should learn from the People's Liberation Army," expressed their determination to truly learn the glorious traditions and fine style of the PLA while fighting shoulder to shoulder with the PLA soldiers. After thorough preparation, the soldiers and workers, the platoons of the unit, and the teams of the propaganda team formed "red pairs."

During the "red pair" activities, workers and soldiers read Chairman Mao's works together every day, exercise together, attend classes together, hold study sessions on using Chairman Mao's works, criticize and repudiate revisionism together, study work together, and hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes together. The heart-to-heart talks between the pairs are particularly active. They humbly learn from each other's strengths, enthusiastically help each other with weaknesses, and jointly discuss and solve problems. Everyone unanimously praises the "red pair" activities, saying they have three major advantages:

1. The soldiers say: Pairing up with workers in "red pairs" allows them to learn from the workers at any time, further raising their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. Second Squad Leader Li Xiangui is a young man who grew up in bitterness and sweetness. He paired up with the old worker He Jikan in a "red pair." He Jikan often talked to him about the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in China. Li Xiangui drew rich nourishment from this old worker and felt that his feelings for Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line were not as deep as this old worker's. He took He Jikan as an example, daring to temper himself in the struggle, forging a red heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and his political consciousness continuously improved.

2. The workers say: Pairing up with PLA soldiers in "red pairs" allows them to better learn the good experiences and styles of the PLA in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, and promoting the "Three-Eight" style. Worker Chen Shuichang, after entering the station, was enthusiastic and did a lot of work, but he was not good at grasping living thoughts or doing painstaking ideological and political work. The PLA soldier Gao Jijun, who paired up with him in a "red pair," discovered this and studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings with him, sharing his own experiences. From practice, Chen Shuichang deeply understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching on "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed." He and Gao Jijun, in helping revolutionary masses implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasped and solved many problems by focusing on living thoughts. He deeply felt: Learning the glorious traditions and political work experience of the PLA, we can complete Chairman Mao's great historical task of leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure more quickly and better.

3. Further strengthening military-civilian relations. They say: The "red pair" activities have made our hearts even closer. Through "red pair" activities, workers and PLA soldiers have heart-to-heart talks, help and learn from each other, unify their thinking and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, and better lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation at the station.

Because workers and soldiers work together, the propaganda team has smoothly carried out its work at the 101 Station, achieving remarkable results. They not only helped the two revolutionary factions achieve and consolidate revolutionary unity but also launched a vigorous struggle, criticism, and transformation campaign. Under the leadership of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the revolutionary masses at the 101 Station also widely carried out "red pair" activities, determined to make contributions in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    互相学习、互相帮助，更好地领导上层建筑斗批改
    工人宣传队同志和解放军战士结成“一对红”
    进驻七机部一○一站的工人毛泽东思想宣传队的工人和战士同心协力，工作取得显著成绩
    据新华社讯　配合工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻七机部一○一站的人民解放军北京部队某部机枪三连指战员，同宣传队的工人同志，普遍结成对子，开展了“一对红”活动。这样，既有助于解放军战士和工人之间的互相学习，互相关心，互相帮助，促进思想革命化；又有利于进一步加强军民团结，并肩携手，带领进驻单位广大革命群众，认真搞好斗、批、改。
    进驻一○一站的工人毛泽东思想宣传队是由一批优秀的工人组成的。配合这个宣传队进驻一○一站的解放军连队是一个英雄的连队。这个连队连续七年被评为四好连队。这些无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的工人和战士，一汇合到一起，就表达了互相学习的决心。解放军战士们学习了毛主席关于“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示，决心以工人阶级为榜样，加速思想革命化。工人同志遵照毛主席“全国学人民解放军”的教导，纷纷表示要在和解放军指战员并肩战斗中，把解放军的光荣传统、优良作风真正学到手。这样，经过充分酝酿，战士和工人，部队的班和宣传队的组，普遍结成了“一对红”的对子。
    在“一对红”活动中，工人和战士一起天天读毛主席著作，一起出操上课，一起开学习毛主席著作讲用会，一起斗私批修，一起研究工作，一起举办毛泽东思想学习班。对子之间的谈心活动开展得特别活跃。他们彼此发现了优点就虚心学习，发现了缺点就热情帮助，遇到了问题就共同商量解决。大家一致称赞“一对红”好，说它有三大好处：
    一、战士们说：和工人同志结成“一对红”的对子，可以随时随地向工人同志学习，进一步提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。二班长李显贵是个苦水里生甜水里长的青年，他和老工人何吉堪结成了“一对红”的对子。何吉堪经常对他谈旧社会的苦，新社会的甜，揭发批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行。李显贵从这位老工人身上吸取了丰富的营养，他感到自己对毛主席、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的感情没有这位老工人的深。他处处以何吉堪为榜样，勇于在斗争中锻炼自己，锤炼无限忠于毛主席的红心，政治觉悟不断提高。
    二、工人们说：和解放军同志结成“一对红”的对子，能更好地把解放军活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风等好经验、好作风学到手。工人陈水长进站后，积极热情，做了大量的工作，但他不善于抓活思想，不善于做艰苦细致的思想政治工作。和他结成“一对红”对子的解放军战士高继君发现以后，就和他一起学习毛主席的有关教导，并把自己的体会介绍给他。从实践中，陈水长深刻地理解了毛主席关于“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的”这一教导的伟大意义。他和高继君在帮助革命群众落实毛主席最新指示的工作中，大抓狠抓活思想，解决了不少问题。他深有体会地说：学到解放军的光荣传统和政治工作经验，我们就能更快更好地完成毛主席交给工人阶级的领导上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的伟大历史任务。
    三、进一步密切了军民关系。他们说：“一对红”活动使我们的心联得更紧了。工人和解放军同志通过“一对红”活动交心谈心，互帮互学，用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一行动，更好地领导了进驻单位的斗、批、改。
    由于工人和战士同心协力，宣传队进驻一○一站以来，工作顺利开展，取得了显著成绩。他们不仅帮助两派革命群众实现和巩固了革命大联合，而且掀起了轰轰烈烈的斗、批、改高潮。在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的带动下，一○一站的革命群众也广泛开展了“一对红”活动，革命群众决心在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中作出贡献。
