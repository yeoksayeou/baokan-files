In the newly established junior high class at Guanghui Commune Elementary School, there is an active female student. During class, she listens attentively to the lectures. During her free time, she studies and discusses the issues of rural education revolution with her classmates and teachers. When the topic of education revolution comes up, she excitedly tells you, "If it weren't for the education revolution, I wouldn't have been able to enter junior high school."

This student is Liu Guohua, the daughter of a poor peasant from Changwu Production Brigade. Her entry into the junior high class indeed involved some twists and turns.

In March of this year, the commune elementary school, following the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao on education revolution, studied the demands of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and established a junior high class. The method of recruiting new students was "mass recommendation, brigade selection, commune review, and teacher participation," with entrance exams serving only as a reference. Each production team enthusiastically recommended their most outstanding primary school graduates, and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Changwu Brigade first nominated Liu Guohua.

However, after the entrance exam, the teachers did not agree to Liu Guohua's admission, citing her poor exam scores as the reason. But the poor and lower-middle peasants of Liu Guohua's production team insisted on recommending her. The disagreement could not be resolved, so it was brought to the admission committee, composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, cadre representatives, and revolutionary teachers and students, for discussion.

The admission committee learned from the school about Liu Guohua's exam situation. She indeed scored poorly, with very few points. However, they heard from the peasants of her production team that Liu Guohua was indeed the best-performing student in the brigade. Everyone said she loved Chairman Mao the most, loved the collective the most, and loved labor the most. Every morning before going to school, she would stand on the hilltop and use a loudspeaker to propagate Mao Zedong Thought before heading to class. In the afternoon, she would return home and propagate Mao Zedong Thought before entering the house. Several times, when Chairman Mao's latest instructions reached them, she was the first to spread them to every household. Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, in the more than two years of revolutionary storms, she had firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and fought resolutely against a handful of class enemies. Liu Guohua's family had many mouths to feed but few laborers. Every day after returning from school, she would participate in collective labor and take on heavy household chores, leaving her little time to review her lessons, which was one reason for her poor exam scores.

After a comprehensive understanding and discussion, the admission committee unanimously decided to admit Liu Guohua. The teachers who previously did not agree to her admission, after hearing the peasants' introduction of her, also willingly accepted this student. They also criticized themselves, saying, "We have been deeply poisoned by the revisionist educational line. Even now, 'intellectual education first' and 'grades are king' still haunt our thoughts. This time, we almost kept a fine young sprout out of school."

    好苗苗
    在光辉公社完小新附设的初中班里，有一个活跃的女学生，上课时她专心听讲，课余时和同学、老师一起研究开展农村教育革命的问题。一提起教育革命，她就兴奋地对你说：“要不是教育革命，我还进不成初中哩。”
    这个学生叫刘国华，是长武大队一个贫农的女儿，她进初中班的确是有一番周折的。
    今年三月，公社完小遵照毛主席教育革命的光辉思想，研究了广大贫下中农的要求，附设了初中班。招收新生采用“群众推荐，大队选拔，公社审查，教师参加”的办法，入学考试只作参考。各生产队都纷纷把最优秀的小学毕业生推荐出来报名，长武大队的贫下中农首先提名的就是刘国华。
    可是经过入学考试，教师不同意刘国华入学，理由是她入学考试成绩差。但是，刘国华所在的生产队贫下中农坚持要推荐她入学。分歧解决不了，提到由贫下中农、社队干部和革命师生代表共同组成的招生委员会讨论。招生委员会向学校了解了刘国华入学考试的情况，她确实考得差，得分比较少。但是，他们听了队里贫下中农的介绍，刘国华确实是队里学生中表现最好的一个。大家说她最热爱毛主席，最热爱集体，最热爱劳动。每天上学之前，她都要先站在山坡上用话筒宣传一阵毛泽东思想才上学，下午回家，她照例要宣传一阵毛泽东思想才进屋。有几次，毛主席最新指示传到他们那里时，她都是以最快的速度传到每家每户。文化大革命开始后，在两年多的革命风暴中，她坚定不移地站在毛主席革命路线的一边，与一小撮阶级敌人进行了坚决的斗争。刘国华家里人口多，劳力少，她每天从学校回家来都要参加集体劳动，又要担任繁重的家务，平时温习功课的时间很少，这是她入学考试成绩差的一个原因。
    招生委员会经过全面了解和研究，一致决定接受刘国华入学。过去不同意刘国华入学的教师在听了贫下中农对她的介绍后，也心悦诚服地收下了这个学生。他们还自我批评说：我们受修正主义教育路线毒害太深，到现在“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”还在我们思想上作怪，这次差一点把一根好苗苗关在校外。
