The Chinese Embassy in Albania, led by Charge d'Affaires Li Tingqian, and embassy staff and Chinese engineering and technical personnel working in Albania were invited to attend the celebration.

The stage was adorned with portraits of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. The national flags of both countries and the slogan "Long Live the People's Republic of China!" were prominently displayed.

The celebration was presided over by Chairman of the Albania-China Friendship Association Abdul Kelmendi.

Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party Qafez Spasiu addressed the meeting.

Spasiu said in his speech that the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, was one of the most significant events in human history, following the great October Socialist Revolution led by Lenin and Stalin. Today, the People's Republic of China has become an unshakable stronghold of world revolution and socialism, a fearless banner in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique, as well as against reactionaries in various countries.

Spasiu pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, has mobilized hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres. Under the leadership of the Party, they have risen with tremendous force to defend Marxism-Leninism and the socialist system in China, and have dealt a fatal blow to the counter-revolutionary plots of the capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev. The glorious victory of establishing revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China, except Taiwan Province, marks the complete victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line and strategy, and signifies that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new and higher stage, the stage of nationwide struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Spasiu said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has blocked the road to the restoration of capitalism, ensuring that the giant China will forever remain red and advance unceasingly as the strongest shock brigade of international communism.

Spasiu pointed out that Comrade Mao Zedong's latest instructions on fully mobilizing the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work are of great significance for the further victory of this revolution. These instructions have aroused great revolutionary enthusiasm and optimism throughout China, further consolidating the position of Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian dictatorship of the People's Republic of China.

He pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China not only has great national significance but also has great international significance for the people of the world, for all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries, and especially for the people of countries ruled by revisionist cliques. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism.

Spasiu said that the great People's Republic of China has become an invincible stronghold of socialism, a powerful base for world revolution, a banner of Marxism-Leninism, and a resolute and steadfast defender of the freedom-loving peoples of all countries. The People's Republic of China, with its principled foreign policy, has resolutely and uncompromisingly fought against the aggressive policies of imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionists, winning the admiration, respect, and support of the freedom-loving peoples of the world. The People's Republic of China has become a great example for them in their struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries.

Spasiu said that the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party have, from the very beginning, strongly and unreservedly supported and endorsed the Cultural Revolution in China, enthusiastically hailing every victory of this revolution. They regard the victories of this revolution as victories of Marxism-Leninism, as victories of Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line and thought, as victories of the Albanian people and the revolutionary peoples of the world, and are firmly convinced that this revolution will achieve complete victory.

Spasiu, in discussing the recent decision by the Albanian People's Assembly to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, said that this is a revolutionary decision of great historical significance. He said that our Party and people have contemptuously condemned the Warsaw Pact, thrown it into the dustbin of history, smashed the revisionist "ace card," and completed another revolutionary action. This action is of great significance not only for our country but also for the cause of socialism, world peace, and the revolutionary peoples of the countries under revisionist rule.

Spasiu said that our Party and people's bold revolutionary decision has been warmly welcomed and highly praised by Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations and the revolutionary peoples of the world. This decision has received the firm support of the great Communist Party of China and the Chinese people.

Spasiu said that the telegram from the great leader of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, our most respected friend Chairman Mao Zedong, and his closest comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as Premier Zhou Enlai, to our Party and people's leader Comrade Enver Hoxha and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mehmet Shehu, is a brilliant document of the internationalist revolutionary unity between the great Chinese people and the Albanian people.

Spasiu said that this powerful telegram has inspired every Albanian, making our people even stronger, more invincible, and indestructible. This telegram is also a serious warning to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their lackeys: if they dare to touch Albania, if they dare to play with fire, they will be completely and thoroughly burned in this fire.

Spasiu said, "Let the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their lackeys remember the solemn warning given by Comrade Enver Hoxha at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Democratic Front a year ago: 'The heroes who can frighten the Albanians have not been born yet, neither in the past nor now.' The People's Republic of Albania will stand as firm as a rock on the Adriatic coast, making our enemies bleed."

Spasiu pointed out that currently, a new historical stage in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionists has begun. The class contradictions in the capitalist world are deepening and sharpening. The positions of imperialism have been weakened by the heavy blows of the national liberation struggles and revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world, especially the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. For a long time, they have been playing the "peace talks" trick to deceive and conquer the Vietnamese people. These "peace talks" are a conspiracy jointly planned by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to divide spheres of influence and rule the world with two imperialist powers.

Spasiu said that today, the Albanian people, with high revolutionary spirit, are steeling themselves in unity around the Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Central Committee, fighting to realize the grand program of the Party's historic Fifth Congress and the teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha, and for the further revolutionization of all aspects of our country's life. They are "holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other," relying on their own strength, and advancing bravely to deepen the socialist revolution in all fields.

Spasiu said that the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party, which concluded yesterday, has set important tasks for our Party and people to further deepen the socialist revolution through class struggle and the mass line. Faithfully carrying out these tasks will make our revolution advance to new heights and become even more invincible.

Spasiu said that in the struggle to build socialism, the Albanian people have received and continue to receive the comprehensive, selfless, and internationalist aid of the brotherly Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. We thank them for this generous aid and internationalist support.

He pointed out that the visit of the Party and government delegation led by Comrade Bekir Balluku will make a contribution to further strengthening the great, combat, and indestructible friendship between Albania and China and our brotherly all-round cooperation.

Charge d'Affaires Li Tingqian then spoke. He said that this year, the 700 million Chinese people are celebrating their great national day amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, achieving comprehensive victory.

Li Tingqian continued, saying that the heroic Albanian people, under the correct leadership of the Albanian Labor Party led by the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, have hoisted the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism high, achieving brilliant victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The series of revolutionary measures taken by the Albanian Labor Party to block the channels for the production of revisionism are of great value in developing the socialist revolution and preventing the restoration of capitalism. These revolutionary measures have further consolidated the proletarian dictatorship of Albania, making the great socialist beacon of Albania shine even more brilliantly.

Li Tingqian said that in the international class struggle, the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have always hoisted the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, resolutely opposing imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, deeply exposing and resolutely striking at the Soviet revisionists, the greatest traitors in history. The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have always hoisted the banner of proletarian internationalism, resolutely supporting the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, resolutely supporting all Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations, and have established immortal merits in defending Marxism-Leninism and promoting the international proletarian revolutionary cause.

Recently, the People's Republic of Albania solemnly announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. This bold and revolutionary action is another heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist clique, greatly encouraging the struggle of the peoples of Eastern European countries against modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionists, and has made a great contribution to the international communist movement. The Chinese people express their sincere admiration and firm support for this. The 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will, as always, stand firmly on the side of the brotherly Albanian people, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "At any time and under any circumstances, we will always stand firmly on the side of the brotherly Albanian people."

Li Tingqian warmly praised the indestructible combat friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania, forged by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha. He said that the 700 million Chinese people, tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, and forever stand together with the Albanian people, fight together, and win together.

The meeting was filled with the atmosphere of indestructible revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples of Albania and China. The participants repeatedly shouted enthusiastically: "Enver-Ho! Mao Zedong!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Friendship is the guarantee!"

    伟大的牢不可破的中阿两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    地拉那集会热烈庆祝中国人民光辉节日
    据新华社地拉那三十日电　阿尔巴尼亚—中国友好协会和阿尔巴尼亚对外文化友好联络委员会九月二十九日晚在地拉那文化宫举行群众集会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年。
    出席大会的有阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记希斯尼·卡博，政治局委员、地拉那市委第一书记马努什·穆夫蒂乌，政治局委员、国家计划委员会主席斯皮罗·科列加，政治局候补委员、阿中友协主席阿卜杜勒·凯莱齐，政治局候补委员卡德里·哈兹比乌和皮洛·皮里斯特里，书记处书记查费尔·斯巴修，中央委员贝哈尔·什图拉、达什诺尔·马马基、法迪尔·帕奇拉米、希托·恰科、米洛·基尔科、奈斯蒂·纳赛、谢夫切特·佩奇和绍玛·德雅纳，中央候补委员哈奇列·布拉希亚、约吉亚·普雷姆蒂、卡雷曼·伊利、塞费尔·塞费里以及阿尔巴尼亚对外文化友好联络委员会主席米斯科·特雷斯卡等。
    地拉那市劳动人民、阿尔巴尼亚人民军指战员、各群众组织的代表参加了庆祝会。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃，以及大使馆工作人员和在阿尔巴尼亚工作的中国工程技术人员代表应邀出席了庆祝会。
    会场主席台上高悬着阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的画像和中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的画像，阿中两国的国旗和“中华人民共和国万岁！”的标语。
    庆祝大会由阿中友协主席凯莱齐主持。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央书记处书记斯巴修同志在大会上讲了话。
    斯巴修在讲话中说，一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国的成立，是继列宁和斯大林领导的伟大的十月社会主义革命之后，人类历史上最重大的事件。今天，中华人民共和国已经成了世界革命和社会主义的坚不可摧的强大堡垒，成了同以美帝为首的国际帝国主义和以苏修叛徒领导集团为首的现代修正主义以及各国反动派进行针锋相对斗争的大无畏的旗手。
    斯巴修指出，由毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，发动了亿万工农兵、学生、知识分子和革命干部，他们在党的领导下，以雷霆万钧之力起来保卫马克思列宁主义和中国的社会主义制度，致命地打击、揭露和粉碎了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命罪恶阴谋。全中国除台湾省以外的各省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会的辉煌胜利，标志着毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义革命路线和战略的彻底胜利，标志着无产阶级文化大革命已经进入了一个新的更高的阶段，即全国范围内的斗、批、改阶段。
    斯巴修说，中国无产阶级文化大革命堵塞了破坏革命和复辟资本主义的道路，使巨人般的中国永不改变鲜红的颜色，并作为国际共产主义最强大的突击队而永不停息地向前迈进。
    斯巴修指出，毛泽东同志关于要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用的最新指示，对这场革命的进一步的胜利，具有非常重大意义。这些指示在全中国激起了伟大的革命热情和乐观主义精神，进一步巩固了马克思列宁主义的阵地和中华人民共和国的无产阶级专政。
    他指出，中国的无产阶级文化大革命不仅具有伟大的民族意义，而且对全世界人民、全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命者，首先是对那些修正主义集团当权的国家的人民，具有伟大的国际意义。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，给了帝国主义和现代修正主义以极大的打击。
    斯巴修说，伟大的人民中国已经成为不可战胜的社会主义的堡垒，世界革命的强大基地，马克思列宁主义的旗手和爱好自由的各国人民的坚决的、坚定不移的捍卫者。中华人民共和国以她的原则性的对外政策，坚决地、毫不妥协地进行反对以美帝为首的帝国主义和以苏修为首的现代修正主义侵略政策的斗争，赢得了全世界爱好自由的人民的赞扬、崇敬和支持。中华人民共和国成了他们反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派斗争中的令人鼓舞的伟大榜样。
    斯巴修说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，从一开始就大力地、毫无保留地支持和拥护中国的文化大革命，热烈地欢呼这场革命的每一个胜利，把这场革命的胜利，看作是马克思列宁主义的胜利，看作是毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线和毛泽东同志的思想的胜利，看作是阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界革命人民的胜利，并坚信这场革命将取得彻底胜利。
    斯巴修在谈到阿尔巴尼亚人民议会最近通过的阿尔巴尼亚退出华沙条约的决议时说，这是一个具有重大历史意义的革命决议。他说，我党和我国人民蔑视地谴责了华沙条约，把它扔进了历史的垃圾堆，粉碎了修正主义的这张骗人“王牌”，完成了又一个革命行动，这个行动不仅对我国，而且对社会主义事业、世界和平以及在修正主义统治下的那些国家的革命人民的利益，也具有伟大的意义。
    斯巴修说，我党和我国人民所作出的勇敢的革命决定，受到了马克思列宁主义政党和组织、世界革命人民的热烈欢迎和高度赞扬。这一决定首先得到了伟大的中国共产党和中国人民的坚决的支持。
    斯巴修说，中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖、我国人民最尊敬的朋友毛泽东主席和他的最亲密的战友林彪副主席以及国务院总理周恩来给我党和我国人民的领袖霍查同志、部长会议主席谢胡同志的电报，是伟大的中国人民同阿尔巴尼亚人民的国际主义革命团结的一个光辉文献。
    斯巴修说，这个具有巨大力量的电报，振奋了每个阿尔巴尼亚人的心，使我国人民变得更加坚强，更加不可征服，不可摧毁。这个电报同时也是对美帝、苏修及其走狗的一个严重警告：如果他们胆敢碰一碰阿尔巴尼亚，如果他们胆敢玩火，他们将彻底、干净地被烧死在这场烈火中。
    斯巴修说，让美帝、苏修及其走狗记住一年前恩维尔·霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚民主阵线第四次代表大会上所作的庄严的警告：“能够吓倒阿尔巴尼亚人的好汉，过去没有，现在也还没有生出来。”阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国将象磐石一样坚不可摧地屹立在将使我们的敌人碰得头破血流的亚得里亚海边。
    斯巴修指出，目前，世界上反对以美帝为首的帝国主义和以苏修为首的现代修正主义斗争的一个新的历史阶段已经开始了。资本主义世界的阶级矛盾日益深化和尖锐化。帝国主义的阵地由于受到全世界人民的民族解放斗争和革命运动，特别是越南人民的英勇斗争的沉重打击，正日益被削弱。它们为了摆脱困境，很久以来就玩弄“和谈”阴谋，以便欺骗和征服越南人民。这些“和谈”是美帝和苏修为了划分势力范围、由两个帝国主义大国主宰世界的交易而共同策划的。
    斯巴修说，今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民已经以高度的革命精神，钢铁般地团结在以霍查同志为首的劳动党和党中央周围，投入了为实现党的历史性的第五次代表大会的宏伟纲领和霍查同志的教导以及为我国全部生活的进一步革命化而进行的斗争中。他们“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”，自力更生，为在各个领域里进一步深入开展社会主义革命而奋勇前进。
    斯巴修说，昨天闭幕的党的六中全会，对我党和我国人民提出了通过开展阶级斗争和贯彻群众路线进一步深入进行社会主义革命的重要任务。始终不渝地执行这些任务将会使我们的革命朝着新的顶峰迈进，并更加坚不可摧。
    斯巴修说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设社会主义的斗争中得到了并一直得到兄弟的中国人民、中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志的全面的、毫不吝惜的、国际主义的援助。我们感谢他们的这种慷慨的援助和国际主义的支持。
    他指出，由贝基尔·巴卢库同志率领的我国党政代表团的访问，将为进一步加强伟大的、战斗的、牢不可破的阿中友谊和我们的兄弟般的全面合作作出贡献。
    李庭荃临时代办接着讲话。他说，今年，七亿中国人民是在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命夺取全面胜利的凯歌声中，欢庆自己的伟大节日的。
    李庭荃接着说，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的胜利。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所采取的一系列旨在堵塞产生修正主义孔道的革命化措施，对于发展社会主义革命和防止资本主义复辟，提供了宝贵的经验。这些革命化措施，进一步巩固了阿尔巴尼亚的无产阶级专政，使阿尔巴尼亚这盏伟大的社会主义明灯放射出更加灿烂的光辉。
    李庭荃说，在国际阶级斗争中，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯高举反帝反修的旗帜，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义，深刻揭露和坚决打击苏修这一伙历史上最大的叛徒。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民一贯高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，坚决支持全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，坚决支持全世界马克思列宁主义政党和组织，为捍卫马克思列宁主义和推进国际无产阶级革命事业，建立了不朽的功勋。
    最近，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国庄严宣布退出华沙条约，这一英勇果敢的革命行动，是对苏修叛徒集团的又一沉重打击，大大鼓舞了东欧各国人民反对以苏修为首的现代修正主义的斗争，对国际共产主义运动作出了重大贡献。中国人民对此表示由衷的钦佩和坚决的支持。用毛泽东思想武装起来的、在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民，坚决遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“在任何时候、任何情况下，都将始终如一地站在兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。”
    李庭荃热烈赞扬由毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造起来的中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间牢不可破的战斗友谊。他说，在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民，一定高举马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵循毛主席的教导，永远同阿尔巴尼亚人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    大会自始至终洋溢着阿中两国人民牢不可破的革命友谊和战斗团结的气氛。与会者不断热烈地高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“毛泽东同志万岁！”“友谊就是保证！”
