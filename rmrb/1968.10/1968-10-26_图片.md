National labor model worker Lu A'gou from Shanghai, with his loyal heart to the great leader Chairman Mao, together with his fellow workers, has planted the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on the scientific battlefield. This fully proves the great truth that "the lowly are the wisest" and that the working class can lead everything. This is Lu A'gou (center) studying the vibrating plow with the workers, determined to achieve new victories in the new wave of the struggle-criticism-transformation movement!
