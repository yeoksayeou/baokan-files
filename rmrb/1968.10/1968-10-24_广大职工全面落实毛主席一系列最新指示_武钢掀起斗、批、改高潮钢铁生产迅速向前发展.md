Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company have launched a magnificent wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, driving steel production rapidly forward.

Currently, the movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought is thriving at Wuhan Iron and Steel Company. The struggle, criticism, and transformation movements are vigorously underway in all units of the company, with frequent production victories and continuous technological innovations and revolutions. Since September, the steel and iron output of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company has significantly increased.

In the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, under the leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops stationed in Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, have launched fierce attacks against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hubei Province and Wuhan City, such as Wang Renzhong, as well as a handful of class enemies within the company, achieving one great victory after another.

In the sharp and intense class struggle, the revolutionary workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company deeply feel that following Chairman Mao is victory, and following the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is victory. They actively study Chairman Mao's works, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promote the continuous development of the revolution and production. So far, the various factories and mines under Wuhan Iron and Steel Company have held more than 500 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 50,000 participants. Through these studies, the political consciousness of the revolutionary workers has been continuously raised, further consolidating the revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in various factories and mines, and rapidly launching the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement.

In the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the revolutionary workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company have shown great power. With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops stationed in Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, they have severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, broken old frameworks, and greatly liberated productive forces. Problems that the bourgeois technical "authorities" dared not touch in the past have now been solved by the worker masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, when the roof of a large furnace collapsed, according to the methods of the bourgeois technical "authorities," the furnace had to be cooled down and bricks had to be replaced, taking half a month to resume production. Now, workers, braving high temperatures, take turns operating on the furnace roof and repair the collapsed bricks in just three and a half hours, ensuring normal production. The No. 1 blast furnace in the iron smelting plant, after a major overhaul, according to the opening plan of the bourgeois technical "authorities," needed more than a month from the opening to normal production. Recently, workers used Mao Zedong Thought to formulate an opening plan of concentrating superior forces to fight a battle of annihilation, which was both safe and labor-saving. Iron was produced in three days, and normal production was achieved in five days, creating an unprecedented miracle. The revolutionary creative power displayed by the revolutionary workers in the struggle, criticism, and transformation is driving the production of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company forward.

    广大职工全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示
    武钢掀起斗、批、改高潮钢铁生产迅速向前发展
    新华社武汉二十三日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，武汉钢铁公司广大革命工人以高昂的革命热情掀起了波澜壮阔的斗、批、改高潮，推动钢铁生产迅速向前发展。
    现在，武钢活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动蓬勃发展，公司所属各单位的斗、批、改运动正在轰轰烈烈地展开，生产捷报频传，技术革新和技术革命的新成就不断涌现。九月份以来，武钢的钢铁产量大幅度上升。
    在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，武汉钢铁公司的广大革命工人在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部英明领导下，在人民解放军驻武钢支左部队的大力支持下，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北省和武汉市的代理人王任重之流，以及本单位的一小撮阶级敌人，发动了猛烈进攻，取得了一个又一个伟大胜利。
    在尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争实践中，武钢的广大革命工人深刻体会到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部就是胜利。他们积极学习毛主席著作，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，推动了革命和生产的不断发展。武钢所属各厂矿到目前为止，已经举办了五百多期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的达五万多人次。通过学习，广大革命工人政治觉悟不断提高，进一步巩固了各厂矿的革命大联合和革命三结合，迅速掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。
    武钢广大革命工人在斗、批、改中显示了强大的威力。他们在解放军驻武钢支左部队的帮助下，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，破除旧框框，大大解放了生产力。过去资产阶级技术“权威”不敢碰的“老大难”问题，现在被用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人群众解决了。过去，大型厂加热炉顶发生塌砖现象，按照资产阶级技术“权威”的办法，必须凉炉补砖，要等半个月的时间才能恢复生产。现在，工人们冒着高温，轮流到炉顶去操作，只用三个半小时就把炉顶的塌砖修好，保证了正常生产。炼铁厂的一号高炉，过去大修后开炉，按照资产阶级技术“权威”搞的开炉方案，从开炉到正常生产需要一个多月的时间，最近工人们运用毛泽东思想制订了集中优势兵力打歼灭战的开炉方案，既安全又省力，三天出铁，五天就达到正常生产，创造了前所未有的奇迹。广大革命工人在斗、批、改中焕发出来的革命创造力，正在推动着武钢的生产不断向前发展。
