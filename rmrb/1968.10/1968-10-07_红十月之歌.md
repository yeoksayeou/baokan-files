	Red October Song
	Air Force Troops  Sun Ruicheng

	Red sky,
	Red earth,
	Red mountains and rivers,
	Red flag.

	Nineteen years on the revolutionary path,
	Overcoming countless storms and rains;
	Now guarding the outpost to welcome October 1st,
	Endless pride and joy!

	Wipe the revolutionary gun in hand,
	Feel the green military uniform on the body,
	The soldier's smiling face looks at the motherland,
	Waves of emotion surge, tears of joy fall.

	Who paints the grand blueprint of October?
	Who summons the thunder of October?
	Who raises the red flag of October?
	Who blazes the trail of October?

	From Shaoshan Village comes a giant,
	Ten thousand mountains and hills seem low!
	"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" —
	The truth's voice shakes the world!

	The great footsteps march north and south,
	Comrade Mao holds high Lenin's banner;
	Red plumes dance along the Xiang River,
	Torches burn on Jinggang Mountain...

	Iron flow for 25,000 miles,
	Revolutionary cannon fire fierce and dense,
	Shattering the three great mountains,
	The majestic new China stands tall!

	How despicable is the traitor Khrushchev,
	Using the theory of "class struggle extinction" as a cover,
	Black guns and poisoned arrows in hand,
	Launching sneak attacks on the proletarian front...

	Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand from Tiananmen,
	The Cultural Revolution's thunder roars,
	Soldiers and horses move across ten thousand mountains and rivers,
	Turning the bourgeoisie's nest into mud!

	Through countless storms and rains,
	The proletarian ranks are purer and stronger,
	The socialist homeland is more magnificent!

	Look today, the revolutionary situation is excellent,
	Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread;
	Even more joyous is the redness across the nation today,
	Chairman Mao opens a new era for humanity!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao,
	Your instructions are unparalleled in power;
	The invincible Mao Zedong Thought,
	Guides the revolution to create miracles!

	Wipe the revolutionary gun in hand,
	Feel the green military uniform on the body,
	The soldier at the outpost welcomes October 1st,
	Facing Chairman Mao, taking an oath:
	The song of revolutionary struggle,
	We will sing it forever;
	The path of revolutionary struggle,
	We will walk it steadfastly to the end!

	Thousands of voices cannot sing it enough,
	The song of "The East is Red" shakes the heavens!
	Thousands of times cannot shout it enough,
	Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!

    红十月之歌
    空军部队　孙瑞卿
    红色的天啊，
    红色的地，
    红色的江山，
    红色的旗。
    革命路上十九年啊，
    战胜多少风和雨；
    而今守在哨所迎“十一”，
    无限骄傲无限喜！
    擦擦手中的革命枪，
    摸摸身上的绿军衣，
    战士笑脸望祖国啊，
    心潮澎湃热泪滴。
    十月的宏图谁描绘？
    十月的风雷谁唤起？
    十月的红旗谁高举？
    十月的道路谁开辟？
    韶山冲走出巨人来，
    千山万峰都显低！
    “枪杆子里面出政权”啊，
    真理的声音震寰宇！
    伟大的脚步走南北，
    毛委员高举列宁的旗；
    湘江两岸舞红缨，
    井冈山上燃火炬……
    铁流二万五千里，
    革命的炮声猛又密，
    把三座大山全砸碎，
    堂堂的新中国顶天立！
    可恨中国赫鲁晓夫大叛徒，
    用“阶级斗争熄灭”论作虎皮，
    黑枪毒箭握在手，
    向无产阶级阵地搞偷袭……
    毛主席在天安门上挥巨手，
    文化大革命风雷激，
    千山万水兵马动，
    把资产阶级老巢砸成泥！
    几度狂风吹，
    多少暴雨洗，
    无产阶级队伍更纯洁更坚强，
    社会主义江山更壮丽！
    看今天，革命形势无限好，
    毛泽东思想空前大普及；
    更喜今日全国一片红，
    毛主席开创人类历史新世纪！
    毛主席啊，毛主席，
    您的指示威力无比；
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，
    指导革命创奇迹！
    擦擦手中的革命枪，
    摸摸身上的绿军衣，
    战士在哨所迎“十一”，
    面对毛主席发誓语：
    革命战斗的歌，
    咱永生永世唱下去；
    革命战斗的路，
    咱坚定不移走到底！
    千声万声唱不完啊，
    《东方红》颂歌震天响！
    千遍万遍喊不够啊，
    祝福毛主席万寿无疆！
