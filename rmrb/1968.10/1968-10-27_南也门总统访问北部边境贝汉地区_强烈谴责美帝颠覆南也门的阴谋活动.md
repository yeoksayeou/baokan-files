South Yemen President Sabi recently visited the northern border region of Beihan, where he once again strongly condemned and exposed the conspiracies of American imperialism aimed at overthrowing the South Yemen government.

On the 18th, President Sabi addressed a crowd in Beihan, discussing the attempts by American imperialism, British colonialism, and the reactionary forces of Saudi Arabia to overthrow the South Yemen government. He stated, "We will resolutely smash all their conspiracies. Today, we inspected our camps here and saw the weapons our brave soldiers have seized from the enemy. These weapons are made in America, and the boxes have 'friendship' markings with handshake symbols. Whose friendship is this? It is clearly the 'friendship' between the United States and Saudi Arabia to eliminate our revolutionary government."

The crowd at the meeting repeatedly shouted, "Down with American imperialism! Down with Johnson! Down with the Saudi Arabian reactionaries!"

On the afternoon of the 18th and the morning of the 19th, President Sabi inspected some frontline positions of the armed forces in the Beihan region. He told the soldiers, "You are stationed here on the frontline to repel any attacks by American imperialism, the Saudi Arabian reactionaries, and the lackeys of the former rulers."

Before going to Beihan, on the 17th, President Sabi also visited Lodar and Mukaylas in the third province.

In his speech at the crowd gathering in Lodar, he reiterated the need to develop the South Yemen nation on the basis of self-reliance. South Yemen has a vast workforce, a strong will, and the determination to achieve its goals.

In his speech at the crowd gathering in Mukaylas, he called on the people to remain vigilant and repel any aggression by the enemy.

    南也门总统访问北部边境贝汉地区
    强烈谴责美帝颠覆南也门的阴谋活动
    新华社亚丁二十三日电　南也门总统沙比最近在访问北部边境的贝汉地区时，再一次强烈谴责和揭露美帝国主义颠覆南也门政权的阴谋活动。
    十八日，沙比总统在贝汉的群众集会上谈到美帝国主义、英殖民主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派企图推翻南也门政权时指出：“我们将坚决粉碎他们的一切阴谋活动。我们今天视察了我们在这里的兵营，并且观看了我们英勇的军队从敌军那里缴获的武器。这些武器都是美国造的，武器的箱子上都刻有握手的‘友谊’标记。这种友谊是谁和谁的友谊？这显然是美国和沙特阿拉伯要消灭我们革命政权的‘友谊’。”
    出席集会的群众一再高呼：打倒美帝国主义！打倒约翰逊！打倒沙特阿拉伯反动派！
    十八日下午和十九日上午，沙比总统视察了贝汉地区武装部队的一些前线阵地。他向士兵们说，你们驻在这里的前线阵地是为了击退美帝国主义、沙特阿拉伯反动派和前统治者的走狗发动的任何进攻。
    沙比总统在去贝汉之前，十七日还访问了第三省的洛达尔和穆凯拉斯。
    他在洛达尔的群众集会上讲话时重申，有必要在自力更生的基础上发展南也门国家。南也门有巨大的人力、坚强的意志和能够达到目的的决心。
    他在穆凯拉斯群众集会上讲话时，号召群众经常保持警惕，击退敌人的任何侵略。
