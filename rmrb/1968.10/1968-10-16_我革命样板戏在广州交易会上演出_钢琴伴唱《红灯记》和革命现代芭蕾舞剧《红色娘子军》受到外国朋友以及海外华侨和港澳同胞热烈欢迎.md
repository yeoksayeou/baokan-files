Foreign friends from five continents attending the 1968 Autumn China Export Commodities Fair, as well as overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, watched the proletarian revolutionary art new species—piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" tonight at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou.

The performance by the Central Orchestra, China Opera Troupe, and the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Ballet Troupe was warmly received by the guests. Many foreign friends said that Chinese proletarian revolutionary artists, following the brilliant path indicated by Chairman Mao, have reached a new peak in world art that no one has ever reached before. Some said that in the face of such excellent artistic performances, all the slander and rumors about Chinese revolutionary model operas have become "paper tigers" that cannot withstand a single blow. Many foreign friends said that the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" are great victories achieved by Chinese proletarian artists in practicing Chairman Mao's instructions of "learning from the past to serve the present and learning from foreign countries to serve China." They are a powerful demonstration of the success of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

Patriotic overseas Chinese and compatriots from the front lines of the anti-British struggle in Hong Kong and Macau watched tonight's performance with great excitement and joy. They said that the birth of each revolutionary model opera in the motherland makes all revolutionary people rejoice and makes imperialists and modern revisionists tremble. The birth of revolutionary model operas fully demonstrates the immense power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art.

During this trade fair, in addition to continuing to perform the piano-accompanied "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" for foreign audiences and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Guangzhou, the China Opera Troupe, Central Orchestra, and the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Ballet Troupe will also successively perform the revolutionary modern opera "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," and the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang." The Shanghai Opera Troupe and the Shanghai Dance School "White-Haired Girl" performance team will also come to Guangzhou to perform the revolutionary modern opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Harbor," and the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl" during the trade fair. The concentration of so many revolutionary model operas at the trade fair is unprecedented in the history of the fair.

    我革命样板戏在广州交易会上演出
    钢琴伴唱《红灯记》和革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》受到外国朋友以及海外华侨和港澳同胞热烈欢迎
    新华社广州十五日电  来自世界五大洲参加一九六八年秋季中国出口商品交易会的外国朋友，以及海外华侨和港澳同胞，今晚在广州中山纪念堂观看了无产阶级革命文艺的新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》和革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》。
    中央乐团、中国京剧团和工农兵芭蕾舞剧团革命文艺工作者的演出，受到来宾们的热烈欢迎。许多外国朋友说，中国无产阶级革命文艺工作者沿着毛主席指引的光辉道路，登上了前人没有到达过的世界艺术的新高峰。有的说，在这样好的艺术表演面前，对中国革命样板戏进行的一切造谣诽谤，都变成了不堪一击的“纸老虎”。不少外国朋友说，钢琴伴唱《红灯记》和革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，是中国无产阶级文艺工作者贯彻毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”的指示，在自己的实践中获得的重大胜利，是无产阶级伟大文艺革命获得成功的有力说明。
    参加交易会的爱国侨胞和来自反英抗暴斗争前线的港澳同胞，怀着无比兴奋和喜悦的心情，欣赏了今晚的演出。他们说，祖国的每一个革命样板戏的诞生，使一切革命人民欢欣鼓舞，使帝国主义者和现代修正主义者丧胆。革命样板戏的诞生，充分显示了毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的无比威力。
    在这次交易会期间，中国京剧团、中央乐团、工农兵芭蕾舞剧团除继续向外国观众和广州市广大工农兵群众演出钢琴伴唱《红灯记》和革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》外，还将陆续上演革命现代京剧《红灯记》、《沙家浜》和革命交响音乐《沙家浜》。上海京剧团和上海舞蹈学校《白毛女》演出团，也将在交易会期间，前来广州演出革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》、《海港》和革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。在交易会上集中演出这样多的革命样板戏，这是交易会历史上从来没有过的。
