The editors of *Red Flag* magazine note: This article was originally published in the *Jiangxi Daily* and has been slightly edited for republication here. This school has only four full-time teachers (including one administrator), and the rest of the teachers are workers, tea farmers, and technicians of worker origin, with excellent results. This experience might also be tried in urban schools. The article does not mention how to select students from among the poor and lower-middle peasants; other materials have good experiences in this regard. It seems that implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolution in rural areas might be faster, as it is easier to establish the leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants in rural schools. This further proves the necessity of sending work teams composed of PLA soldiers to urban schools. Those who still have doubts about this matter should study the rural situation.

The main focus of this article is to introduce the experience of educational reform at the Wukou Tea Plantation Tea Farming and Reading Middle School in Wuyuan County, Jiangxi Province. This middle school was established in 1965. At the time of its establishment, it was not clear which line to adhere to and which path to take. To discuss this issue, the plantation management and the school held several meetings. Invited tea plantation workers and old tea farmers all spoke at the meetings. They compared the old tea vocational school and the old tea specialized school that had previously been established here, exposing the harm of being detached from proletarian politics, workers and peasants, labor, and reality, and condemning the crimes of the bourgeois educational line. The poor and lower-middle peasants strongly demanded: "Our tea school must not be like the old schools under bourgeois rule, turning our children into useless people who cannot carry or lift. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and cultivate 'socialist-conscious, cultured laborers.'"

After this meeting, the plantation management and the school actively invited tea plantation workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the leadership and management of the school. They strengthened the political and ideological leadership of the working class over the school. Whenever the school's policies and guidelines were discussed, tea plantation workers and local poor and lower-middle peasants were invited to participate, listen to their criticisms, opinions, demands, and suggestions. Tea plantation worker representatives also directly participated in the school's revolutionary committee. In this way, under the participation and promotion of tea plantation workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, they gradually implemented educational reforms according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line.

How does this new type of school conduct teaching?

Under the leadership and management of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, Wukou Tea Plantation Tea Farming and Reading Middle School has opened up a new path in educational reform.

The general principle of the school's educational reform is to emphasize proletarian politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, have fewer but more focused courses, closely combine teaching with labor and production, and apply what is learned.

The characteristics of the school's educational reform are: going out of the classroom, learning from workers and peasants, using production bases as classrooms, combining theory with practice, learning industry in the tea plantation, and learning agriculture in the fields. Because classroom teaching and production practice are closely combined, students learn quickly, remember firmly, and can apply what they learn.

(1) Emphasize the study of Chairman Mao's works. They distributed a copy of the *Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong* (Volume B) to each teacher and student, and canceled general language courses, making political courses and language courses all focus on studying Chairman Mao's works, especially his latest instructions and instructions related to the educational revolution. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held throughout the school, in classes, in squads, and in dormitories. There was a lecture and discussion session every week, held by squads or classes on a regular basis. In this way, the study of Chairman Mao's works was truly placed in the foremost position.

The school also focused on class education, using the current class struggle in the locality, the plots of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the direct sabotage of this school's "resume classes and make revolution" by active counter-revolutionaries as negative teaching materials to educate teachers and students. This raised their class struggle awareness, awareness of the two-line struggle, and proletarian feelings, and motivated them to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought with deep class feelings, transforming their worldview.

(2) Strive to eliminate the two-line struggle in teaching, simplify teaching materials, and strive for practicality. Traditionally, tea schools focused on classroom teaching and had little contact with production practice, with complicated courses and learning what was not useful. At the beginning, Wukou Tea School had twelve courses just for tea, plus basic courses like mathematics, physics, and chemistry, totaling twenty-one courses, which students could not handle. What was learned was not used, and what was needed was not learned, wasting the energy and time of both students and teachers. However, due to the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and the old ideas in people's minds, some teachers had conservative thoughts about reforming teaching materials. Those who taught mathematics taught according to the old methods, those who taught foreign languages advocated opening foreign language courses, and some chemistry teachers, to show off their "talent," wrote chemical structural formulas that filled a blackboard, all unrelated to tea.

Nothing can be established without destruction. The plantation management and the school, in response to these obstacles to educational reform, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. At the criticism meeting, Zhu Jinguang, who had worked for many years at the old tea vocational and specialized schools, angrily said: "The past education was completely the feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist line. The students it produced were mostly full of fame and fortune in their minds and full of empty theories in their mouths. After three years of tea school, the tea they made was first-grade tea turned into third-grade, either red or burnt. If we still follow the path of 'reading books for officialdom' and 'fame and fortune,' whoever has more points is better, then we will fall into the trap of China's Khrushchev. Being led by the nose by landlords and the bourgeoisie is forgetting our roots. We must not do that." The old worker's powerful exposure and condemnation had a great educational impact on everyone.

After raising awareness, the school leadership promptly proposed facing production and reality, with teachers and students going out of the classroom to the production base for classes, using on-site teaching and practice to judge teaching materials and content, deciding what to keep and what to discard, and implementing reforms.

Deeply entering reality through experiments brought good results. Teachers and students, based on practical needs, combined the complicated teaching materials and seemingly isolated courses under the principle of serving tea and agricultural production, simplifying some and compiling concise and concise outlines for others. Through these efforts, the tea professional courses have been reduced from the original twelve to two, and the basic courses like mathematics, physics, and chemistry have been greatly simplified, making both teachers and students very satisfied.

(3) Learn from workers and peasants, with "barefoot teachers" in the classroom, and intellectuals and young students taking the path of integrating with workers and peasants, implementing the three-in-one teaching method of workers, peasants, and teachers. This school has only four full-time teachers (including one administrator), and the rest are tea plantation workers, tea farmers, and technicians of worker origin as teachers, using tea plantation workshops, gardens, fields, and classrooms as lecture halls to teach tea cultivation and initial processing, agricultural crop planting and management, and so on. This practice has gradually become a system. Workers and peasants have rich production experience, and when they teach, they are vivid and easy to understand, very popular with the students. Students reflected: "From the worker and peasant teachers, we learned a lot that we couldn't learn in the classroom before." "In the workshop, listening to old workers teach, it's understandable, easy to learn, memorable, and applicable." Some teachers said that in the past, when they taught internal combustion engines, it took seven or eight classes to explain, and students forgot the beginning after listening to the end. But after the old worker comrade from the tea plantation explained, it didn't take an hour, and it was explained clearly and thoroughly. The machine was disassembled and assembled in the worker's hands, very obedient.

(4) Participate in production practice and learn in labor. This school has also gone through a struggle in implementing the policy of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." At the beginning, some teachers and students were afraid of hardship and fatigue and did not want to participate in productive labor. Some teachers said, "I am here to teach, not to labor." Some students also thought they were here to study, not to labor. In response to these thoughts, the plantation management and the school organized teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's relevant works and quotations. Chairman Mao said: "The working people need to be educated, and intellectuals need to be laborers." He also said: "Cadres, through participating in collective productive labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." Through study, the consciousness of everyone generally improved, taking the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example, learning while producing, and thriftily running the school, establishing a revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, and insisting on the path of combining education with productive labor.

Usually, they insisted on doing what they learned, making teaching closely combine with local labor and production. For example, from August each year to the following April, when agricultural work in the tea area is relatively light, they mainly focus on learning tea garden measurement and planning, tea initial processing factory design, tea tree cultivation, and transplantation technology, doing and learning at the same time; learning while doing; less classroom teaching, more fieldwork.

In addition to daily participation in labor, during the busy tea season each year, the classroom was moved to the tea garden and tea plantation to participate in labor and field operations, learning from workers and peasants in practice. This year, Wukou Tea Plantation had a bumper harvest, with large tasks of picking and initial processing. The revolutionary teachers and students of the school actively took on the task of initial tea processing. In two months, they diligently learned from tea processing workers, the spirit of selflessness, active labor, and the noble quality of thrift. At the same time, through practical operations, they learned a lot of technical knowledge and operational experience of initial tea processing. They achieved a double harvest of learning and labor, completing the initial processing of more than 200,000 pounds of tea on time and in quality, strongly supporting the production of the tea plantation and contributing to the socialist construction of the country.

New-type school cultivates successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, with the working class leading the school and the poor and lower-middle peasants managing the school, this new-type school has a healthy atmosphere and good style. More than a hundred young students of Wukou Tea Farming and Reading Middle School are being cultivated to become "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers."

Not only are the young students growing up healthily under the education of the worker and peasant masses, but the school's teachers also learn from workers and peasants, taking the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, step by step following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They resolutely resist the reactionary "multi-center is no center" theory and various reactionary bourgeois ideologies.

They have a firm stance and clear hatred, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," and fighting the enemy bravely and resolutely. They often travel back and forth more than ten miles at night to the plantation management and nearby communes to fight class enemies with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. One day, they discovered escaped counter-revolutionaries on the mountain and went up the mountain to catch them at night. All the revolutionary teachers and students of the school, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, exposing and condemning the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi, such as Fang Zhichun, criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and criticizing the bourgeois ideology that despises workers and peasants. They have deep hatred for class enemies and deep love for workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. When a road to the stream by the school was damaged, making it inconvenient for the working people to walk, some students took the initiative to repair the road; an old peasant woman from the Wukou production team had her children not by her side, and the students often fetched water, chopped firewood, and planted vegetables for her; near the school, there was a small slope where laborers often struggled to pull their carts, and the students, seeing this, would run up to help push, treating each other as class brothers.

They are thrifty, love labor, and selfless. In the three years since the school was established, they have insisted on the path of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, printing their own teaching materials, using simple teaching equipment, and like the old Red Army, cutting their own hair, washing and mending their own clothes, repairing their own desks and chairs, and having only a wooden bed, a table, and a few stools in the teacher's room. They planted their own vegetables and raised pigs. Because the teachers and students insisted on labor and production, they achieved self-sufficiency this year without spending a penny from the state.

This school cultivates students who are good in thought, good in study, good in labor, and good in style.

Student Cheng Weishi, who came to the school in 1966, had not stayed for three days before she started complaining about wanting to go home and not wanting to labor. She said, "It's shameful to labor in school." The first time she participated in labor, she was assigned to pull down old tea trees, and after pulling a little, her palms had several blisters. When she went up the mountain to chop firewood, the workers and peasants she went with chopped a full load, but she only chopped fourteen pounds in a morning, and when she returned, she didn't even want to eat, lying in bed and saying her whole body ached. Everyone called her "Miss." However, after a period of education and tempering, her thoughts and feelings changed greatly. In the past, when she encountered peasants carrying manure on the road, she would cover her nose from afar. Now, she often goes with her classmates to carry manure and plant vegetables. In April this year, she took leave to return home, and her mother said to her, "Weishi, your brother came back from the army to visit, and this is rare. This time, you stay at home for a few days to rest and play with your brother, and don't do anything." She agreed, but as soon as her mother left, she went to participate in labor with the commune members. Everyone praised her, saying, "Since Weishi entered the tea school, she has made rapid progress. Now she can do both literary and martial arts, truly a good student educated by Chairman Mao."

What kind of school cultivates what kind of people, which is good and which is bad, the worker and peasant masses are the best judges. Yu Jinghong and her cousin, both from poor peasant families, graduated from primary school. Yu Jinghong entered the tea middle school, while her cousin studied in another middle school. In their childhood, the two had similar thoughts, but after being cultivated by two different schools, they became two different people. Yu Jinghong made rapid progress and was repeatedly commended as an active element in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, attending the tea plantation and county active elements' representative meeting to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. She deeply loved Chairman Mao, often saying, "Chairman Mao is our poor and lower-middle peasants' savior. Without Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants would have nothing. If Chairman Mao had not led us to stand up, how could I have gone to school to study! We must not forget our roots after standing up. I will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao to make revolution!" What about her cousin? He also changed: he dressed more elegantly than before, and his skin was whiter than before. At the beginning of entering middle school, he sometimes participated in labor when he returned home. Later, he didn't even want to participate in labor when he returned home. The villagers saw the changes in the two and said, "The tea school is good, it is a good school for us poor and lower-middle peasants. It doesn't cost the state a penny to study, and the students it cultivates are also good."

The students of the tea school not only made great progress in politics and ideology but also improved rapidly in professional knowledge. The students have both theoretical knowledge and practical operational skills. Before they entered the tea school, they were very unfamiliar with tea production. Now, they are very proficient in the entire production process of tea tree cultivation, tea garden management, pest control, tea picking, and initial tea processing. Students who entered in 1965 can now participate in tea garden planning and tea initial processing factory design and machine installation work, much stronger than graduates from junior tea specialized schools. The person in charge of this school is a former technician of the tea plantation from a poor peasant family. He came to work at the tea plantation soon after graduating from the Central South Tea Specialized School in 1954. He compared himself with the current students of the tea school. At that time, he had only some book knowledge and knew nothing about planting and processing tea, designing tea factory buildings, and installing machines. It was only later, following Chairman Mao's teachings, taking the path of integrating with workers and peasants, and humbly learning from the worker and peasant masses, that he gradually mastered the tea profession and related technologies in practice. He truly said to everyone, "Workers and peasants are our parents, and workers and peasants will forever be our teachers. If we want to learn some skills to serve the people, we must follow Chairman Mao's words and learn from workers and peasants, taking the path of integrating with workers and peasants."

Local poor and lower-middle peasants praised the students of this school, saying, "These are truly our students who work in the fields. Such young people are real and reliable, and we can trust them and put our hearts at ease!" Many places in the county often inquire about when this school will enroll new students, and poor and lower-middle peasants all want to send their children here to study.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue."

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it must be led by the working class and must have the participation of the worker masses, in conjunction with PLA soldiers, to implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination with students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end. The worker propaganda teams should stay in the school for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school, and permanently lead the school. In rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

The experience of Wukou Tea Plantation Tea Farming and Reading Middle School in Wuyuan County not only proves how great and wise Chairman Mao's instructions are but also proves that the new type of school advocated by Chairman Mao, where theory and practice are united, is completely achievable. A high tide of educational revolution is coming to the country and the province!

    一所理论和实际一致的新型学校
    ——江西省婺源县武口茶叶耕读中学的调查报告
    《红旗》杂志编者按：此文原载《江西日报》，略加删改，转载于此，供参考。这所学校只有四个专职老师（包括一名负责人），其他的则请工人、茶农以及工人出身的技术员当老师，效果很好。这个经验，城市里的学校是不是也可以试验一下呢？如何从贫下中农中选拔学生，文中未提及，这方面别的材料中已有较好的经验。看来农村中实现毛主席无产阶级教育革命思想，可能速度较快，原因是那里的学校比较容易树立贫下中农的优势。这就更加证明城市里派出有解放军战士参加的工人毛泽东思想宣传队进学校去，是多么必要。那些对这件事还持有怀疑态度的人们，不妨研究一下农村的情况。
    本文的重点是介绍婺源县武口茶场茶叶耕读中学在教学改革方面的经验。这所中学是在一九六五年创办的。创办时，对应该坚持什么路线，走什么道路，并不明确。为了讨论这个问题，茶场场部和学校召开了几次会议，被邀请的茶场老工人和老茶农都在会上发了言。他们对照过去设在这里的旧茶叶职业学校和旧茶叶专科学校，大摆了脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农、脱离劳动、脱离实际的危害，控诉了资产阶级教育路线的罪恶。贫下中农强烈地提出要求说：“我们茶校决不能象过去资产阶级统治的学校那样，把子弟弄成肩不能挑，手不能提的废物。我们一定要照毛主席的教导，培养出‘有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者’。”从这次会议以后，场部和学校主动请茶场工人和贫下中农直接参加学校的领导和管理。他们大力加强工人阶级对学校的政治思想领导，每逢讨论学校的方针政策，都请茶场工人和当地贫下中农参加，听取他们的批评、意见、要求和建议，茶场工人代表并直接参加了校革命委员会。这样，在茶场工人和贫下中农的参加和推动下，他们就逐步按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，实行了教育革命。
    这种新型的学校怎样进行教学
    在工人阶级和贫下中农领导和管理下，婺源县武口茶叶耕读中学，在教学改革方面开辟了一条新道路。
    这所学校教学改革的总原则是突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，课程内容少而精，紧密结合劳动生产，学以致用。
    这所学校教学改革的特点是：走出教室，拜工农为老师，以生产基地为课堂，理论联系实际，既在茶场学工，又在田地里学农。由于课堂教学和生产实践紧密结合，学生学得快，记得牢，用得上。
    （一）大抓毛主席著作的学习。他们发给每个师生一册《毛泽东著作选读》乙种本，又把一般的语文课取消，和政治课一样，都专学毛主席著作，特别是毛主席的一系列最新指示和有关教育革命的指示。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，全校办，班级办，班排办，寝室办。每周一次讲用会，以班排或班级为单位定期举行。这样，做到切实把毛主席著作的学习放在首要的位置。
    学校还抓紧阶级教育这一环，如以当地现实阶级斗争中，地富反坏右的阴谋活动，现行反革命直接破坏这个学校“复课闹革命”的累累罪行的事实，作为反面教材，对师生进行教育，以提高他们的阶级斗争观念、两条路线斗争觉悟，激发他们的无产阶级感情，促使师生们带着这种深厚的阶级感情，去更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观。
    （二）狠抓教学上的两条路线斗争，教材删繁就简，力求实用。历来办茶叶学校都是以课堂教学为主，接触生产实际很少，课程烦琐，学非所用。开始，武口茶校仅茶叶一项就有十二门课，加上数理化等基础课，共达二十一门之多，学生怎么负担得了？学的用不上，要用的没有学，对学生和教师的精力、时间都是极大的浪费。但是，由于反革命修正主义教育路线的影响和人们头脑中的旧意识作怪，有的教师对教材的改革还有保守思想，学数学的按老一套讲数学，学外语的主张增开外语课，有的化学老师为了显示自己的“才华”，化学结构式，一写就是一黑板，全和茶叶没关系。
    不破不立。场部和学校针对教改的这些阻力，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线。在批判会上，曾在旧茶职、旧茶专做了多年工的朱金贵同志愤怒地说：“过去的教育完全是封、资、修那一套，教出来的学生多半是满脑子的名利思想，满嘴空头理论，读了三年茶校，做出的茶，一级茶做成了三级，不是红就是焦。如果我们今天还走‘读书做官’、‘有名有利’的邪路，谁的分数多谁就好，那就上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当。被地主、资产阶级牵着鼻子走，这就是忘本，我们千万不能那样做。”老工人这样有力的控诉揭发，给大家教育很大。
    认识提高以后，学校领导又及时提出面向生产，面向实际，师生走出课堂，到生产基地去上课，通过现场教学和实践，来鉴别教材和教学内容，那些该取，那些该舍，实行改革。
    深入实际进行实验的办法带来了很好的效果。师生们根据实践需要，把烦琐教材，把看来是彼此孤立的各项课程，都在服务于茶叶和农业生产的原则下集中起来，有的删繁就简，有的编成简明扼要的讲义。经过这样的努力，目前茶叶专业课已由原来的十二门减少为两门，数理化等基础课也大大精简了，师生都感到很满意。
    （三）拜工农为师，“赤脚老师上课堂”，知识分子和青年学生走与工农相结合的道路，实行了工农、教师、学生三结合的教学方法。这所学校只有四名专职老师（包括一名负责人），其他的就请茶场工人、茶农、工人出身的技术员当老师，以茶场车间、园地、田头、教室为讲堂，教授茶叶的栽培和初制、农作物的种植和管理等等，这种做法已逐渐成为制度。工农有丰富的生产经验，讲起课来形象生动，通俗易懂，很受同学们的欢迎。同学们反映：“从工农老师那里学到了很多过去在课堂上学不到的东西。”“在车间听老工人讲课，听得懂，学得快，记得牢，用得上。”有的老师说，他过去讲动力柴油机，一讲七、八个课时，还是讲不清楚，学生听了后面忘了前面，可是经茶场老工人同志一讲，不用一小时，讲得又清楚又透彻，机器在工人手里拆得开装得拢，听话得很。
    （四）参加生产实践，在劳动中进行学习。这所学校在贯彻“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的方针上也是经过了一番斗争的。开始，有些师生怕苦、怕累，不愿参加生产劳动。有的教师说：“我是来教书的，不是来劳动的。”有些学生也认为自己是来读书的，不是来劳动的。针对这些思想，场部和学校就组织师生学习毛主席有关著作和语录。毛主席说：
  “劳动人民要知识化，知识分子要劳动化。”又说：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”通过学习，思想普遍有了提高，以“抗大”一面学习，一面生产，勤俭办校为榜样，树立起艰苦奋斗的革命精神，坚持走教育与生产劳动相结合的道路。
    平常，他们坚持做什么，学什么，使教学紧密结合当地劳动生产。如每年八月以后到下一年四月以前，茶区农事稍闲，这时主要是开垦和扩充茶地、茶树台刈更新、茶树移植等，学校就着重结合学习茶园测量规划、茶叶初制厂的设计、茶树栽培和移植的操作技术等，一边做，一边学；做中学，学中做；课堂少讲，实地多做。
    除了日常参加劳动以外，每年茶忙季节，课堂就搬到了茶园和茶场，参加劳动，实地操作，在实践中向工农学习。今年武口茶场生产大丰收，采摘、初制任务都很大。学校革命师生主动要求承担了茶叶初制任务。在两个月时间内，他们努力学习制茶工人一心为公，积极劳动，艰苦朴素的高尚品德；同时通过实际操作，学会了茶叶初制的很多技术知识和操作经验。他们获得了学习劳动双丰收，按时按质完成了二十多万斤茶叶初制任务，有力地支援了茶场生产，为国家社会主义建设事业作出了贡献。
    新型学校培养无产阶级革命事业接班人
    在毛主席无产阶级教育路线指引下，工人阶级领导学校，贫下中农管理学校，使这所新型的学校有了健康的空气和良好的作风。武口茶叶耕读中学一百多名青年学生正在被培养“成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。
    不仅青年学生在工农群众的教育下健康地成长，学校的老师，也拜工农为师，走同工农相结合的道路。
    他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，条条落实毛主席的最新指示，对反动的“多中心即无中心论”和各种反动的资产阶级思潮进行坚决抵制。
    他们立场坚定，爱憎分明，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，对敌斗争坚决勇敢。他们经常连夜来回十多里路，到场部和附近公社同工人、贫下中农一起斗争阶级敌人。有一天，发现山上有逃亡的反革命分子，他们就连夜上山去抓。全校革命师生，以毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，揭发和控诉中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人方志纯之流的反革命罪行，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，批判轻视工农的资产阶级思想。他们对阶级敌人无比仇恨，对工人、贫下中农无比热爱。学校到溪边的一条路坏了，劳动人民行走不便，有些同学主动把这条路修好了；武口生产队有个贫农老婆婆，自己孩子不在身边，同学们经常给她挑水、砍柴、种菜；学校附近有个小坡，经常有劳动者拉着车艰难地走着，同学们看到了，都要跑上去，帮助推一推，亲如阶级兄弟。
    他们艰苦朴素，热爱劳动，大公无私。建校三年来，他们坚持走“抗大”的道路，自己编印教材，教学设备因陋就简，还象老红军那样，头发自己理，衣服自己洗、自己补，桌椅自己修，教师的房间里只有一张木床、一张桌子和几条板凳。他们自己种菜、养猪。由于师生们坚持劳动生产，今年实现了自给有余，不要国家一分钱。
    这个学校培养出来的学生思想好、学习好、劳动好、作风好。
    学生程卫时，一九六六年来校时，没住上三天，就闹着要回家，不愿劳动。她说：“在学校里劳动丢脸。”第一次参加劳动，分配她拉砍下来的老茶树，没拉多少，手掌上就起了几个血泡。上山砍柴，和她一起去的工人、农民，砍得满满的一担，她却一个上午只砍了十四斤，回来连饭也不想吃，睡在床上叫全身酸痛。同学们都叫她“小姐”。可是经过一段时间的教育和锻炼，思想感情起了很大的变化。过去，她在路上碰到农民挑大粪朝她走来，老远就捂住鼻子。现在，她经常和同学们一起挑粪种菜。今年四月间她请假回到家里，母亲对她说：“卫时，你哥哥从部队回来探亲，这是难得的。你这次就在家里休息几天，陪你哥哥一起玩玩，不要做什么事了。”她嘴里答应着，可是母亲一走开，她就和社员一起参加劳动去了。大家都称赞她说：“卫时自从进了茶校，进步很快，现在能文能武，真是毛主席教育出来的好学生。”
    什么样的学校，培养什么样的人，那个好，那个差，工农群众是最好的鉴定人。余京红和她的堂兄，家庭出身都是贫农。小学毕业后，余京红考入茶中，她的堂兄在另一所中学读书。在小时候，两个人的思想都差不多，可是经过两种不同学校的培养，却变成两种不同的人。余京红进步很快，多次被评为活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，出席了场、县活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表会。她对毛主席无限热爱，经常说：“毛主席是我们贫下中农的救命恩人，有了毛主席才有我们贫下中农的一切。要不是毛主席领导我们翻了身，我那能进学校读书啊！翻身不能忘本，我要永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席干革命！”而她的堂兄呢？也变了：穿衣服比过去更讲究了，皮肤比过去更白了。开始进中学时，回家有时也参加一些劳动。后来，回家连劳动也不愿参加了。村里人见了他们俩人的变化，都说：“茶校就是好，是我们贫下中农的好学校，读书不花国家一文钱，培养出来的学生又好。”
    茶校学生不仅政治上、思想上有了很大进步，而且在专业知识方面也提高得很快。学生既有理论知识，又有实际操作能力。他们进茶校以前，对茶叶生产很生疏。现在，对茶树栽培、茶园管理、消灭病虫害、茶叶采摘、茶叶初制等整个生产过程都很熟练。一九六五年来的学生，现在已能参加茶园规划和茶叶初制厂的设计与机器安装工作，比中等茶叶专科学校毕业出来的学生还强得多。这个学校的负责人，是贫农出身的原茶场技术员。他是在一九五四年中南茶专毕业后不久就来到茶场工作的。他和现在茶校的同学们比了一比。那时，他除了一些书本知识之外，什么种茶制茶、设计茶厂厂房、安装机器等全不会。只是后来遵照毛主席的教导，走与工农相结合的道路，老老实实地向工农群众请教，在实践中从头学起，才渐渐把茶叶专业以及与此有关的技术学到手，他真正的老师是工人农民。他经常现身说法地把切身感受告诉大家：“工农是我们的父母，工农永远是我们的老师。我们要想学到点为人民服务的本领，就一定要遵照毛主席的话去做，拜工农为老师，走与工农相结合的道路。”
    当地贫下中农称赞这所学校的学生说：“这真是我们作田人的学生，这样的后生，硬是实打实，靠得住，放得心呀！”全县不少地方都有人经常打听这所学校什么时候收新生，贫下中农都想把子女送到这里来学习。
    毛主席教导我们：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”
    毛主席最近又深刻指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”
    婺源县武口茶叶耕读中学的经验，不但证明毛主席这些指示是多么伟大和英明，而且证明了毛主席倡导的这种新型的理论和实际一致的学校是完全可以实现的。全国、全省一个教育革命的高潮，正在到来！
