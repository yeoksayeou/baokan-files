Inspired by the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary workers participating in the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge have fully exerted their leadership in the struggle, criticism, and reform. They insist on letting revolution guide production and strive to accelerate the construction of the road bridge. Currently, the foundations of the piers on both sides of the road approach bridges have been completed, and the speed of pile driving, beam installation, and the production of prestressed beams has significantly increased.

After the railway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was opened to traffic on National Day, the broad masses of bridge builders were filled with the joy of victory. They seriously summarized the rich experience of seizing revolution and promoting production in the previous stage. They followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "the working class must lead everything," firmly grasped the leadership power of revolution and production, and vigorously carried out class struggle and deepened the revolutionary criticism, using revolution to promote the development of production. Representatives who went to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations recently returned to the construction site, bringing back the great leader Chairman Mao's warm concern for the working class and the precious experience of earnestly carrying out struggle, criticism, and reform in the capital and various places. This greatly inspired the broad masses of workers. Each work team widely carried out activities of recalling and comparing the past with the present and revolutionary criticism. The workers recalled the sufferings of the working class in the old society, the discrimination and suppression of workers by the Chinese Khrushchev, and compared it with Chairman Mao's boundless trust and love for the working class. Their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines was greatly enhanced. Many old workers excitedly said, "In the old society, the capitalists trampled us workers underfoot. The Chinese Khrushchev treated us workers as living tools and ruthlessly suppressed us. Only Chairman Mao trusts us, the working class, and calls on us to lead everything. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud!" They also used the great role and miraculous achievements of the working class in the bridge construction process to denounce the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents who treated workers as "living tools." Through recalling the past and revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of bridge builders greatly promoted the idea of being masters of the house. They had a global vision, did everything for the revolution, and worked wholeheartedly for the revolution. Many workers ate and slept on the construction site, working day and night, and continued to work despite the wind and rain. The installation workers at the four construction sites of the bridge saw that the wooden molds for making pedestrian walkways consumed a lot of wood, so they took the initiative in their spare time to act as masons, successfully trial-manufactured "brick-paved pedestrian walkway bottom molds" using cement and bricks, saving the country a large amount of wood and accelerating the production speed of pedestrian walkways.

Revolutionary criticism also broke through many outdated customs, and the wisdom and creativity of the broad masses of workers were fully exerted, creating many technological innovations. On the north bank of the Yangtze River, there are two parallel railway tracks on both sides of the road approach bridge. Due to the rapid progress of the project, the transportation track on the west side of the approach bridge was overloaded and could no longer transport prestressed beams. To solve this problem, the workers broke through numerous obstacles and, based on their practical experience, laid a special curve, successfully solving the transportation problem of prestressed beams. After completing this creation, they held an on-site criticism meeting, exposing and criticizing the crimes of the capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" who suppressed the creativity of the masses, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers to seize revolution and promote production.

Currently, the workers building the Yangtze River Bridge are, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing every minute," vigorously seizing revolution and vigorously promoting production. They are determined to create even better achievements and make new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    南京长江大桥广大革命工人在斗批改中充分发挥领导作用
    坚持以革命统帅生产加速公路桥建设
    新华社南京二十九日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的鼓舞下，参加南京长江大桥建设的广大革命工人，充分发挥在斗、批、改中的领导作用，坚持以革命统帅生产，努力加速公路桥的建设。目前，两岸公路引桥的桥墩基础已经全部完成，打桩、架梁和生产预应力梁的速度都大大加快。
    南京长江大桥铁路桥在国庆节通车以后，广大建桥工人满怀胜利的喜悦，认真总结了前阶段抓革命、促生产的丰富经验。他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席“工人阶级必须领导一切”的教导，牢牢掌握好革命和生产的领导大权，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，以革命带动生产的发展。赴京参加国庆观礼的代表最近返回工地以后，带来了伟大领袖毛主席对工人阶级的亲切关怀，带来了首都和各地工人阶级认真搞好斗、批、改的宝贵经验，给广大工人群众极大的鼓舞。各工班普遍开展了回忆对比和革命大批判活动。工人们忆旧社会工人阶级的苦，忆中国赫鲁晓夫对工人的歧视和打击，比毛主席对工人阶级的无比信任和爱护，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。许多老工人激动地说，旧社会资本家把我们工人踩在脚下，中国赫鲁晓夫把我们工人当成活工具，肆意打击。只有毛主席最信任我们工人阶级，叫我们领导一切。毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气！他们还用建桥过程中工人阶级发挥的巨大作用和创造的惊人奇迹，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人把工人当作“活工具”的种种罪行。通过回忆对比和革命大批判，广大建桥工人当家作主的思想大发扬。他们胸怀全局，一切为革命，一心为革命。许多工人吃在工地，睡在工地，白天连着黑夜干，顶风冒雨照样干。大桥四处基地队的装吊工看到制造人行道板的木模消耗木料很大，就在业余时间当起泥瓦工，用水泥和砖试制成功了“砖砌人行道板底模”，为国家节约了大量木材，又加速了人行道板的生产速度。
    革命大批判还冲破了许多陈规陋习，广大工人的聪明才智得到充分发挥，创造了许多技术革新项目。长江北岸公路引桥两侧各有一条平行的铁轨运输道。由于工程进展迅速，引桥西侧的运输道负担过重，已经不能再运预应力梁。为此，工人群众冲破重重障碍，凭着自己的实践经验，铺设了一个特殊的弯道，顺利地解决了预应力梁的运输问题。他们完成这项创造以后，还召开现场批判会，揭露和批判了走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”压制工人群众创造性的罪行，极大地调动了广大工人群众抓革命促生产的积极性和创造性。
    目前，建设长江大桥的工人群众正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，狠抓革命，猛促生产，决心创造更优异的成绩，在无产阶级文化大革命中再立新功。
