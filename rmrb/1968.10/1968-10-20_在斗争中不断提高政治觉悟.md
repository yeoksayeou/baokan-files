In the revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women," the brilliant image of Wu Qinghua left a deep impression on me. Her revolutionary spirit of rebellion and her growth through struggle have greatly inspired and educated me.

After joining the Women's Red Army, Wu Qinghua, in one battle, out of a desire for revenge, fired a shot at Nan Batian prematurely, exposing the battle signal and committing a disciplinary error. With the help of Party representative Hong Changqing and her comrades, she understood that revolution is not for personal vengeance but to liberate the laboring people of the world. The proletariat can only ultimately liberate itself by liberating all of humanity. Through struggle, Wu Qinghua enhanced her political awareness, transforming from a spontaneous rebel from a poor family into a conscious revolutionary proletarian fighter, from a laboring woman with a simple class sentiment of revenge into a communist warrior with a great heart for liberating all of humanity.

Wu Qinghua's growth process vividly tells us that the proletariat and revolutionary people, in the process of transforming the objective world, must also transform their subjective world.

In our factory, there are many female textile workers who, like Wu Qinghua, suffered immense exploitation and oppression in the old society. After liberation, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, they have enhanced their political awareness. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through the struggle against class enemies, they have further heightened their class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully unleash the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class must also continuously enhance its political awareness through struggle." This is the greatest trust and greatest encouragement for our working class.

To fulfill the historical mission bestowed by this great era, the working class must continuously enhance its political awareness through struggle. Wu Qinghua is our brilliant example. We should learn from her sense of responsibility towards the revolution and her highly conscious revolutionary spirit of correcting mistakes.

    在斗争中不断提高政治觉悟
    北京第一棉纺织厂女工　侯占新
    革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》中吴清华的光辉形象，给我留下了很深的印象。她的革命造反精神和在斗争中不断成长的过程，使我受到很大的启发和教育。
    吴清华参加娘子军后，在一次战斗中由于报仇心切，擅自开枪打伤了南霸天，过早地暴露了战斗信号，犯了纪律错误。在党代表洪常青和同志们的帮助下，她懂得了：干革命不是为了报私仇，而是为了解放天下的劳动人民，无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己。吴清华在斗争中提高了政治觉悟，由一个自发反抗的穷苦人家的女儿变成了自觉革命的无产阶级战士，由一个怀着报仇雪恨的朴素的阶级感情的劳动妇女，变成了具有解放全人类伟大胸怀的共产主义战士。
    吴清华的成长过程，生动地告诉我们：无产阶级和革命人民在改造客观世界的过程中，也要改造自己的主观世界。
    在我们的工厂里，有许多纺织女工，在吃人的旧社会里，也象吴清华那样，受尽剥削和压迫，吃尽了苦头。解放以后，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，她们提高了政治觉悟。在无产阶级文化大革命中，通过对阶级敌人的斗争，她们进一步提高了自己的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”这是对我们工人阶级的最大信任和最大鞭策。
    我们工人阶级要完成伟大时代赋予我们的历史使命，就必须在斗争中不断地提高自己的政治觉悟。吴清华是我们的光辉榜样。我们应当学习她那种对革命负责，有错就改的高度自觉革命的精神。
