Inspired by the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao on re-educating intellectuals, more than 6,000 graduates from colleges and universities in Hubei Province in 1967 have enthusiastically gone to the front lines of production and construction. They have gone to rural areas, border regions, factories, and grassroots units to participate in labor and accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Among these graduates, a small number have gone to factories to work as laborers, to grassroots units to work as teachers or doctors, while the majority have gone to military farms to engage in agricultural production. They joyfully said: Working and producing together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, combining learning from the military with learning agriculture, and combining ideological transformation with participating in production and construction, is a great opportunity for tempering oneself. They all expressed their determination to learn from the soldiers' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, their noble qualities of serving the people wholeheartedly, and their thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat in production and labor.

Before these graduates took up their posts, the revolutionary committees of their respective schools held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for them, organizing them to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the issue of intellectuals. Armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by China's Khrushchev, such as "public ownership for the sake of private gain" and "reading books to become officials." Their political awareness was heightened, and they further eliminated the erroneous thoughts of looking down on workers and peasants, of only being able to become officials and not being able to serve the people. They happily went to the most difficult places to labor and temper themselves, accepting re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many graduates who had been working as leaders in the school revolutionary committees actively responded to Chairman Mao's call, resolutely expressing their willingness to follow the needs of the state and go to the most difficult places.

According to Xinhua News Agency, nearly 1,000 graduates from colleges and universities in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1966 and 1967 have recently gone to farms to become farmers. The rest of the graduates, more than 80% of them, have gone to rural areas, border regions, factories, and other grassroots units to engage in labor and work, accepting re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Graduates from Guangxi Nationality Institute, Guangxi University, and Guangxi Agricultural College participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized by various levels of revolutionary committees before leaving school. Together with the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in the schools and the soldiers, they repeatedly studied the brilliant works of our great leader Chairman Mao, "Old Three Articles," and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they criticized and repudiated private interests and established public interests, and at the same time, they fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Through study, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad graduates have been greatly heightened. Especially recently, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on intellectuals needing to be re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers, they felt even more deeply the harm done by the revisionist educational line. After several years of study at school, some students from worker and peasant families had less affection for workers and peasants and were not as loving towards them; in school, from theory to theory, their standpoint and viewpoint were far different from those of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, everyone expressed their urgent hope to go to the countryside, to the mountains, to the border regions, to the mines, and to all difficult places to accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, to thoroughly transform their world outlook, and to temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    接受工农兵的再教育　到最艰苦的地方去锻炼
    湖北广西一批大专毕业生上山下乡参加劳动
    据新华社武汉十一日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最近发出的关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示的鼓舞下，湖北省六千多名一九六七年大专院校毕业生，纷纷走上生产建设第一线，到农村、边疆、工矿和基层单位去参加劳动，接受工农兵的再教育。
    这批大专院校毕业生中，除少部分到工矿当工人，到基层单位当教师或医生外，大部分都到军垦农场去参加农业生产劳动。他们高兴地说：同解放军同志在一起生产劳动，把学军和学农结合在一起，把改造思想与参加生产建设结合在一起，真是锻炼自己的大好机会。他们纷纷表示要在生产劳动中，很好地学习解放军指战员对毛主席的无限忠心，学习他们全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质和无产阶级的彻底革命精神。
    这批大专院校毕业生在走上劳动岗位之前，各院校革委会都为他们举办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织他们学习毛主席关于知识分子问题的最新指示。他们以毛主席的最新指示为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“大公有私”、“读书升官”等反革命修正主义谬论，提高了政治觉悟，进一步肃清了轻视工农、轻视劳动，只能当官不能为民的错误思想，愉快地到最艰苦的地方去劳动锻炼，接受工农兵的再教育。许多院校一些已经担任校革委会负责工作的毕业生，积极响应毛主席的号召，坚决表示要服从国家的需要，到最艰苦的地方去。
    新华社南宁十一日电　广西壮族自治区一九六六年和一九六七年大专院校的毕业生最近有将近一千人到农场去当农民。其余的毕业生中，有百分之八十以上已先后奔赴农村、边疆和工矿等基层单位从事劳动和工作，接受工农兵的再教育。
    广西民族学院、广西大学、广西农学院等大专院校的毕业生，在离校前普遍参加了各级革委会举办的毛泽东思想学习班，和驻校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队以及解放军指战员一起，反复学习伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和毛主席的一系列最新指示，以毛泽东思想为武器破私立公，同时狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线。经过学习，广大毕业生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟有很大提高。特别是最近许多毕业生在学习了毛主席发出的关于知识分子要“由工农兵给他们以再教育”的最新指示后，更加感到修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害很深，在学校里学了这几年，有些劳动人民家庭出身的学生，对工农的思想感情就不象以前那么深了，对工农也不是那么热爱了；在学校里，从理论到理论，立场观点与工农兵比较起来差得很远。因此，大家表示迫切希望到农村去，到山区去，到边疆去，到矿山去，到一切艰苦的地方去，接受工农兵的再教育，彻底地改造自己的世界观，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
