The great leader Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." The broad revolutionary cadres of the Shijiazhuang Dyeing and Printing Factory, after more than two years of tempering in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have greatly raised their class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines, further liberated productive forces, and achieved significant development in production.

Since this year, with the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, the factory has deeply criticized bourgeois technical "authorities," and the working class has seized the leadership of production technology from these bourgeois technical "authorities." A wave of mass technical revolution has swept across the entire factory. In just a few months, they have completed eighty-five major technological innovations, and production has been steadily increasing. Before the Cultural Revolution, the highest daily production capacity of this factory only reached 90% of the designed capacity; now, the average daily production capacity has exceeded the designed capacity by more than one fold. This fact powerfully demonstrates that arming the revolutionary masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, will lead to a leap in production development.

Seizing Production and Technical Power from Bourgeois Reactionary Technical "Authorities"

Even before the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the dyeing and printing factory last year, the broad revolutionary cadres of the factory followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and launched a revolutionary criticism. They successively criticized "material incentives," "bonus system," "expert management," and the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," among other revisionist black goods. Through the criticism, the class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines of the revolutionary cadres were raised, and some unreasonable regulations were reformed. However, this criticism and reform were not thorough enough. By February this year, the production and technical power of the entire factory were still in the hands of bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities."

In the past, the dyeing and printing factory had a large organization called the "Chief Engineer's Office," which workers referred to as a typical revisionist "technical courtyard" and the base of "expert management." Before the Cultural Revolution, the "technical courtyard" not only monopolized the production and technical power of the entire factory but also had to approve the promotion, transfer, and salary increase of cadres. During the Cultural Revolution, a small handful of capitalist roaders were ousted, but these bourgeois technical "authorities" still relied on their "technical expertise" and used the banner of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" to continue issuing orders.

The broad revolutionary cadres of the dyeing and printing factory had long hated this revisionist "technical courtyard" and had repeatedly requested its thorough reform. However, some people with rightist conservative thoughts said: "The dyeing and printing factory cannot do without technology; if we smash the technical courtyard, how will production be affected?" The class enemies also took the opportunity to threaten, saying: "Go ahead and smash it, if you have the ability, you do it!" Based on this situation, the comrades from the People's Liberation Army organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people, only the people, are the creators of world history." Through the study, the class consciousness of the revolutionary cadres was further raised, and they decided to carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, smash all revisionist black goods, and let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line firmly occupy all positions.

A fierce struggle began. The broad revolutionary cadres, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, exposed the inner workings of the revisionist "technical courtyard" in large and small meetings, in workshops, and in study classes, and criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of "expert management." Revolutionary technical personnel in the "technical courtyard" also stood up in revolution, joining the broad revolutionary cadres to expose and accuse the crimes of the "technical courtyard." In the past, the "technical courtyard" had formulated a set of regulations and clauses totaling 220,000 characters to control, restrict, suppress, and punish revolutionary cadres, tying the workers' hands tightly. For workers to carry out a technological innovation, they had to go through seven or eight procedures, and in the end, they often did not get approval. The bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in the "technical courtyard" made it difficult for workers in every way but worshipped imperialist and revisionist foreign gadgets with all their might. They spent 120 million yuan of state funds on foreign equipment, but it failed, and instead, the original equipment was damaged, and production was seriously affected.

To further raise everyone's awareness and understand the nature of the "technical courtyard," the comrades from the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary committee decided to further expose the political cover of the "technical courtyard" and see who was actually in power. Everyone dug deeper and found that this "technical courtyard" was not only a revisionist organization but also a hideout for ghosts and snakes. Faced with living facts, the broad revolutionary masses had a deeper understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many comrades said excitedly: "China's Khrushchev crazily promoted the line of 'expert management' to let these bourgeois technical 'authorities' hold the power and implement bourgeois dictatorship over the broad masses of the people! If we do not smash such an organization, we workers will have no way out!"

The revolutionary criticism smashed this factory's revisionist stronghold—the "technical courtyard," and the working class finally seized all the leadership of production and technology from the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities."

The Working Class Must Become the Master of Science and Technology

The revisionist "technical courtyard" was smashed, but the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines did not end. The new battle task facing the working class was to seize the production and technical power of the entire factory and lead the entire factory to produce better than before. At this time, the stationed comrades from the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary committee organized the broad revolutionary cadres to study Chairman Mao's teachings again: "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and working intellectuals. As long as these people take their destiny into their own hands and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they are not evading problems but solving them with an active attitude, any human difficulties can be overcome."

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the revolutionary cadres first established technical research groups in the entire factory and various workshops, consisting of old workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary technical personnel, to assist the revolutionary committee in leading the scientific and technological work of the entire factory and various workshops. Then, a mass technical revolution and technological innovation activity was launched throughout the factory.

In the dyeing process, the washing stage could not keep up, affecting the production of the entire factory. What to do? The comrades of the power workshop printing maintenance group discussed this issue and launched a revolutionary criticism. Originally, this washing stage had long been an obstacle to improving production.

In the past, a small handful of capitalist roaders in the factory did not believe in the masses and relied only on a few "experts" to work on it, wasting a lot of labor and funds over a long period, but it did not succeed. At that time, some old workers watched the production not going up and felt very sad. They had voluntarily proposed experiments, but the capitalist roaders said viciously: "Even the scientific brains couldn't do it, and you stupid people, do you think you can eat swan meat?" They hit the old workers' enthusiasm back.

These facts further educated the revolutionary cadres, and everyone decided to break through the difficulties under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, innovate technology, and add luster to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They carried out revolutionary criticism while contributing ideas and plans. After more than twenty days and nights of intense experiments, they overcame numerous difficulties and finally developed a "high-efficiency washing machine," increasing production efficiency by two to three times.

Some bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" originally thought that without them, they "could not live," and in the end, they had to be "invited back." However, the ironclad facts shattered their beautiful dreams.

Continuing the Revolution, Catching Up with and Surpassing the World's Advanced Level

The working class seized the production and technical power and played a leading role, and the dyeing and printing factory's technical revolution achieved great results. However, the technological innovation projects in the previous period were basically limited to modifications, imitations, or partial changes, and most of them were technological innovations that were relatively simple. Can we, on the current basis, break through some more complex technological projects, take the road that no one has taken before, and catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level? This is a new test for the working class of the dyeing and printing factory.

The electrical equipment of the dyeing and printing factory is relatively complex. The previous set was basically inherited from abroad, with large machine structures, complex operations, low efficiency, and great waste. Someone proposed using silicon rectifier electrical equipment. Silicon rectification is currently the world's advanced electrical technology. Everyone had no experience and no data, and it was uncertain whether it could be done. At this time, someone said: "It's better to have a smaller appetite and take steady steps, don't try to surpass the world's advanced level in one go." The comrades from the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary committee immediately learned about this situation and conducted a study. They believed that these two thoughts, in the end, were a reflection of the struggle between the two lines. To educate the masses and raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's statements: "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the death with our enemies, the determination to restore the old on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand among the world's nations." "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Through the study, the revolutionary cadres increased their confidence, raised their courage, and decided to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and thorough revolution, and strive for higher goals. Many comrades said: "We proletarian revolutionaries must have great aspirations and dare to blaze new trails, take the road that no one has taken before, catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level. This is the need of class struggle and world revolution. Only China's Khrushchev's crawlingism advocates being led by the nose by others and following behind others."

The battle to trial-manufacture silicon rectifier electrical equipment began. The participants in the design were all ordinary workers. The comrades from the People's Liberation Army and the responsible comrades of the revolutionary committee went deep into the teams and studied the design plans with everyone. During the design and trial-manufacturing, when encountering difficulties, the comrades from the People's Liberation Army organized everyone to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, solving the comrades' ideological problems. After more than two months of intense labor, they overcame numerous difficulties and finally successfully trial-manufactured seven "controllable organic silicon rectifier transformers" that reached the world's advanced level, saving the country 200,000 degrees of electricity per year, greatly reducing the dyeing and printing cost, and also playing a significant role in improving production efficiency and product quality.

The successful trial-manufacturing of the "controllable organic silicon rectifier transformer" further liberated the thoughts of the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary technical personnel, pushing the mass technical revolution movement of the dyeing and printing factory forward again. Things that were not dared to be attempted in the past are now daringly experimented and innovated. For example, the old equipment called the "king of boiling cloth" in domestic and foreign dyeing and printing, which no one dared to touch, was proposed to be reformed after the dyeing and printing factory launched the technical revolution. The revolutionary committee supported this proposal, and with collective wisdom, the "king of boiling cloth" was finally trampled underfoot by the working class, increasing the boiling cloth efficiency by dozens of times.

    石家庄市印染厂工人阶级掌握工厂领导大权不断创造新成就
    深入开展革命大批判技术革命飞跃发展
    全厂工人短短几个月内完成八十五项较重大的技术革新，平均日产量超过设计能力一倍多
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”石家庄市印染厂广大革命职工，经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，生产力得到进一步解放，生产有了很大的发展。
    今年以来，这个厂在驻厂解放军的帮助下，深入地批判了资产阶级技术“权威”，工人阶级从这些资产阶级技术“权威”手里夺回了生产技术领导权，一个群众性的技术革命高潮席卷全厂。在几个月的时间内，他们就完成了八十五项较重大的技术革新，产量蒸蒸日上。在文化大革命以前，这个厂历史上最高日产量仅达到设计能力的百分之九十；现在，平均日产量已超过设计能力的一倍多。这个事实有力地说明，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线武装革命群众，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，生产就会有一个飞跃的发展。
    从资产阶级技术“权威”手里夺回生产、技术大权
    早在去年厂革命委员会成立以前，印染厂的广大革命职工，就紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，开展了革命大批判。他们先后批判了“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”、“专家治厂”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等修正主义黑货。在大批判中，革命职工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟提高了，并且改革了一些不合理的规章制度。但是，这个批判和改革搞得不够深透，到今年二月，全厂的生产和技术大权，仍然操纵在资产阶级反动技术“权威”手里。
    过去，印染厂有个庞大的机构——“总工程师室”，工人称它是个典型的修正主义的“技术大院”，是“专家治厂”的基地。在文化大革命前，“技术大院”不仅垄断着全厂生产、技术大权，而且连干部的提拔、调动、增薪，也必须经过他们的批准。在文化大革命中，厂内一小撮走资派被赶下了台，但是，这些资产阶级技术“权威”还凭着“有技术”，打着“抓革命，促生产”的幌子，继续发号施令。
    印染厂广大革命职工，对这个修正主义的“技术大院”，早就恨透了，几次要求把它彻底改造。可是，一些有右倾保守思想的人却说：“印染厂没技术不行，一下把技术大院砸了，影响生产怎么办？”阶级敌人也乘机进行威胁，说：“你们砸吧，有本事你们干！”根据这个情况，解放军同志组织大家学习了毛主席有关教导：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”通过学习，革命职工阶级觉悟进一步提高，决心发扬彻底革命精神，砸烂一切修正主义的黑货，让毛主席革命路线牢牢占领一切阵地。
    接着，一场激烈的斗争开始了。广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在大会、小会上，在车间，在学习班里，纷纷以亲身经历，大揭修正主义“技术大院”的内幕，大批中国赫鲁晓夫的“专家治厂”的修正主义路线。“技术大院”中革命的技术人员，也纷纷起来革命，和广大革命职工一道，揭发控诉“技术大院”的罪行。过去，“技术大院”为了对革命职工实行管、卡、压、罚，炮制了一套长达二十二万字的各种规定条款，把工人的手脚捆得死死的。工人搞一项技术革新，得经过七、八道手续，最后还往往得不到批准。“技术大院”的资产阶级反动技术“权威”，对工人百般刁难，对帝国主义、修正主义的洋玩艺儿却崇拜得五体投地。他们为了搞洋设备，一次就花了国家一百二十万元，结果也没搞成，反而使原设备遭到破坏，生产受到严重影响。
    为了更有效地提高大家的觉悟，认清“技术大院”的本质，解放军同志和革命委员会研究，决定进一步从政治上揭开“技术大院”的盖子，看看究竟是一些什么人在掌权？大家往深里一揭，发现这个“技术大院”，不但是一个修正主义的机构，而且是隐藏牛鬼蛇神的黑窝。在活生生的事实面前，广大革命群众更深刻地认识到无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，许多同志激动地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂推行‘专家治厂’的路线，就是为了让这些资产阶级技术‘权威’来把持大权，对广大人民群众实行资产阶级专政！不砸烂这样的机构，我们工人就没有活路！”
    革命的大批判，摧毁了这个厂的修正主义的顽固堡垒——“技术大院”，工人阶级终于从资产阶级反动技术“权威”手里，夺回了一切生产、技术的领导权。
    工人阶级一定能够成为科学、技术的主人
    修正主义的“技术大院”被砸烂了，但是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争并没结束。摆在工人阶级面前的新的战斗任务，就是要把全厂的生产、技术大权掌起来，并且领导全厂把生产搞得比过去更好。这时，驻厂解放军同志和革委会又一次组织广大革命职工学习了毛主席的教导：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”
    遵照毛主席的教导，革命职工首先在全厂和各车间普遍建立了有老工人、革命干部和革命的技术人员参加的三结合技术研究小组，协助革委会领导全厂和各车间的科学技术工作。接着，在全厂范围内广泛开展了一个群众性的技术革命、技术革新活动。
    印染时水洗这一关跟不上去，影响着全厂的生产。怎么办？动力车间印花保全组的同志们，就这个问题展开了革命的大批判。原来水洗这一关，早就是影响提高生产的一个障碍。
    过去，厂内一小撮走资派不相信群众，只靠少数“专家”去搞，花了很长时间，浪费了许多劳力和资金，结果也没搞成。当时，有些老工人们看着生产上不去很难过，曾主动提出试验，走资派竟恶狠狠地说：“人家科学脑袋瓜都没搞出来，你们笨头笨脑的，癞蛤蟆还想吃天鹅肉！”一棍子把老工人们的积极性打了回去。
    这些事实，进一步教育了革命职工，大家决心在毛主席革命路线指引下，突破难关，革新技术，为毛主席革命路线增光。他们一边进行革命大批判，一边献计献策，设想方案。经过二十多昼夜的突击试验，克服了重重困难，终于试制成了一台“高效水洗机”，提高了生产效率二至三倍。
    一些资产阶级反动技术“权威”，原来满以为离开他们就“不能活”，到头来还得把他们“请回来”。可是，铁一般的事实打破了他们的黄粱美梦。
    不断革命，赶上和超过世界先进水平
    工人阶级掌握了生产、技术大权，发挥了领导作用，印染厂的技术革命，取得了很大成绩。但是，前一段技术革新的项目，基本上还是属于改造、仿制或进行局部的变革，而且大都是一些技术比较简单的革新。能不能在现有基础上，突破一些比较复杂的技术项目，走前人没有走过的路，赶上和超过世界先进水平？这是对印染厂工人阶级的新的考验。
    印染厂的电动设备比较复杂。过去的一套基本上是沿用外国的，机器结构庞大，操纵复杂，效率低，浪费很大。有人提出采用硅整流电动设备。硅整流是目前世界上先进的电动技术，大家没有经验，没有资料，能不能搞成，没有把握。这时又有人说：“胃口还是放小点好，步子迈稳点，别一下子就想超越世界先进水平。”解放军同志和革委会及时了解到这一情况，并立即作了研究。认为这两种思想，归根到底是两条路线斗争的反映。为了教育群众，提高两条路线斗争觉悟，他们便组织大家学习毛主席有关论述：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”革命职工通过学习，增强了信心，提高了勇气，决心发扬不断革命、彻底革命精神，向更高的目标迈进。许多同志说：“我们无产阶级革命派，就是要有雄心壮志，就是要敢于披荆斩棘，走前人没有走过的路，赶上和超过世界先进水平。这是阶级斗争的需要，世界革命的需要。只有中国赫鲁晓夫的爬行主义，才主张让别人牵着我们的鼻子走，跟在人家屁股后面跑。”
    试制硅整流电动设备的战斗开始了。参加设计的都是一些普通工人。解放军同志和革委会负责同志深入到班组，和大家一起研究设计方案。在设计试制中，遇到困难，解放军同志就组织大家活学活用毛主席著作，解决同志们的思想问题。经过两个多月的紧张劳动，克服了重重困难，终于试制成功七台达到世界先进水平的“可控有机硅整流变压器”，每年可为国家节电二十万度，不仅大大降低了印染成本，而且对提高生产效率和产品质量也起到很大作用。
    “可控有机硅整流变压器”试制成功，进一步解放了广大革命职工和革命技术人员的思想，把印染厂群众性的技术革命运动又向前推进了一步。过去不敢想的，现在也敢于大胆地进行试验和革新了。如过去用的煮布锅，是中外印染上号称为“煮布之王”的老设备，从来没人敢动它。印染厂开展技术革命以后，反动技术“权威”还扬言：“十年内改不了煮布锅”。明知山有虎，偏向虎山行。革命职工敢想敢干，硬是提出要改革煮布锅。革委会支持这个建议，群策群力，“煮布之王”终于被工人阶级踩在脚下，使煮布效率提高了几十倍。
