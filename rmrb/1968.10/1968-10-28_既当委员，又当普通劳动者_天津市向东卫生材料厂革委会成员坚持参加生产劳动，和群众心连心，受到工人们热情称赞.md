The members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Xiangdong Sanitary Materials Factory in Tianjin have adhered to the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor." Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee over a year ago, they have consistently participated in collective production labor, serving both as committee members and as ordinary laborers. They have received enthusiastic praise from the workers.

Insisting on Labor to Promote Thought Revolutionization

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Xiangdong Sanitary Materials Factory, revolutionary leading cadres rarely went to the workshops to participate in labor, and revolutionary mass representatives were often tied up by administrative work, unable to go to the work teams. Seeing this situation, the workers worriedly said, "If this continues, our Revolutionary Committee members will change again!"

The concerns of the masses drew the attention of the Revolutionary Committee and the stationed PLA. They brought this issue to a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. In the study class, the PLA guided the members of the Revolutionary Committee to repeatedly study and discuss Chairman Mao's relevant instructions. Chairman Mao said: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people. Through participating in collective production labor, cadres maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." Chairman Mao's instructions deepened everyone's understanding of the significance of participating in collective production labor, providing a profound education for both old and new cadres. They said: We are representatives of the revolutionary masses. If we do not insist on labor, we will become detached from the masses and will not truly represent the revolutionary masses. Only by being laborers and revolutionaries can we be genuine committee members.

The leading body of the Revolutionary Committee immediately formulated measures to achieve laborization and revolutionization: all members of the Revolutionary Committee would not be exempt from labor and would go to the workshops to participate in labor; they would forever study, labor, and criticize and repudiate revisionism together with the workers; while fully playing the collective leadership role of the Revolutionary Committee, they would adopt the responsibility system to ensure long-term face-to-face leadership of the masses in the workshops.

The chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary leading cadre Chen Fuzhong, was originally a worker who later worked in the trade union and never left labor. The masses supported him. After becoming the secretary of the party branch, he was poisoned by the revisionist line of Khrushchev and went to the workshop less and less, becoming increasingly distant from the workers. During the Cultural Revolution, with the help of the revolutionary masses, he realized: a knife not sharpened will rust, a person not laboring will become revisionist. Cadres detached from labor will become detached from the masses and from the revolution. Only by insisting on labor can cadres forever be close to the hearts of the masses. In the study class, he excitedly said: "It was because I was detached from labor and from the masses that I made mistakes. Now Chairman Mao has saved me, and I will never go back on my words!" Now, he not only moved his desk to the workshop and insisted on laboring with the workers every day but also moved his bedding to the factory, sometimes even laboring two shifts a day. The masses were moved and said: "Old Chen has become a new person during the Cultural Revolution!" Over the past year, the seven members of the Revolutionary Committee have all been able to ensure that no matter how busy they are with work, they do not neglect labor.

The Revolutionization of the Masses Guarantees the Laborization of Cadres

Can cadres who are on the job go down to the workshops to labor and persist in doing so year after year without change? This is a common problem encountered.

Soon after the leading body of the Revolutionary Committee of the Xiangdong Sanitary Materials Factory went deep into the workshops to participate in production labor, many new contradictions arose: sometimes someone came to discuss welfare issues, sometimes someone came to get plans or materials, machines broke down and needed the Revolutionary Committee members to find solutions, disputes in the group also needed the members to handle... Being led by these administrative tasks, some committee members could not concentrate on participating in production labor.

How to break free from the administrative circle? The stationed PLA timely armed the members of the Revolutionary Committee with Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's teachings on emphasizing proletarian politics, introduced advanced examples from the army of emphasizing proletarian politics, and shared their personal experiences, telling them that among all the rules, the first is to arm people's minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of the PLA, the Revolutionary Committee took the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought as the top priority for the entire factory, establishing various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The committee members, together with the workers in the production teams, studied, conducted revolutionary criticism and repudiation, exposed and criticized themselves, held lectures on personal experiences, and solved production problems. In the drying workshop's third shift, two female workers had a quarrel. The deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Dong Lequn, who was laboring in the drying workshop's third shift, and the group leader, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "our responsibility is to the people," "all revolutionary comrades should care for, love, and help each other," and related teachings on criticism and self-criticism, using the PLA as an example. The two female workers used Chairman Mao's teachings to reflect on themselves, quickly found their shortcomings, and criticized themselves. Other comrades in the group also enthusiastically pointed out their shortcomings, making the two female workers more united under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Other comrades also received a profound education in Mao Zedong Thought.

Soon, the experience of the drying workshop's third shift was widely applied throughout the factory's various shifts. Among comrades and shifts, if there were any problems, they would solve them themselves and would no longer bother the Revolutionary Committee. The workers said: "We should create more time for the leading body to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and create conditions for laborization. The members of the Revolutionary Committee have to labor and lead the entire factory's movements and production. For anything we can solve ourselves, we should not add to their burden." Many shifts and worker groups, starting from this thought, ensured that problems did not leave the group and contradictions were not handed up. Once, the factory's filter machine broke down. The workers, thinking of the Revolutionary Committee members who were busy with both work and labor, did not go to them but repaired it themselves overnight. They only informed the responsible person of the Revolutionary Committee the next day. This incident deeply moved the members of the Revolutionary Committee. They said: In the past, if a machine broke down, one had to report to the factory director, the factory director would then transfer it to the maintenance team, the maintenance team would then arrange the repair time, involving a series of people and a series of meetings, causing a delay of several days. From this, they deeply felt that relying on systems to manage people would kill people with busyness and exhaustion; emphasizing proletarian politics, arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the revolutionization of people's thoughts, could ensure that the leading body has more time and energy to participate in collective production labor, closely connect with the masses, and better grasp the revolution and promote production. The facts prove that the revolutionization of the masses can better promote the rapid laborization of cadres.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to directly rely on the broad revolutionary masses." Over the past year, the leading body of the Revolutionary Committee of the Xiangdong Sanitary Materials Factory has deeply felt that the laborization of cadres is an important way to closely connect with the masses and rely on the masses.

    既当委员，又当普通劳动者
    天津市向东卫生材料厂革委会成员坚持参加生产劳动，和群众心连心，受到工人们热情称赞
    本报讯　天津市向东卫生材料厂革命委员会成员，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度”的教导，革委会成立一年多来，始终坚持参加集体生产劳动，既当委员，又当普通劳动者，受到工人们的热情称赞。
    坚持劳动，促进思想革命化
    向东卫生材料厂革命委员会成立以后，革命领导干部很少到车间参加劳动，革命群众代表也常常被事务工作缠住手脚，走不到班组里去。工人们看到这种情形，担心地说：“这样下去，咱们革委会的人又要变了！”
    群众的反映，引起了革委会和驻厂解放军的重视。他们带着这个问题，举办了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，解放军引导革委会成员反复学习和讨论毛主席的有关教导。毛主席说：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”毛主席的教导，提高了大家对参加集体生产劳动的意义的认识，使新老干部都受到极其深刻的教育。他们说：我们是革命群众的代表，不坚持劳动，就会脱离群众，就代表不了革命群众，只有当个劳动化、革命化的委员，才是真正象样的委员。
    革委会领导班子当即制订了实现劳动化、革命化的措施：全体革委会成员一律不脱产，到车间去参加劳动；永远和工人学习在一起，劳动在一起，斗私批修在一起；在充分发挥革委会集体领导作用的同时，采用包干负责制，坚持长期在车间对群众实行面对面的领导。
    革委会主任、革命领导干部陈孚忠原来是个工人，后来做工会工作，一直没有脱离劳动，群众很拥护他。当了党支部书记以后，他中了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的毒，到车间劳动越来越少，同工人的感情越来越淡薄。在文化大革命中，他在革命群众的帮助下认识到：刀不磨要生锈，人不劳动要变修。干部脱离劳动，就会脱离群众，脱离革命，干部坚持劳动，才能永远和群众心连心。在学习班上，他激动地说：“我是因为脱离劳动、脱离群众才犯了错误的。现在毛主席挽救了我，再也不能走回头路了！”现在，他不仅把办公桌搬到车间，坚持每天和工人一起劳动，还把铺盖卷搬到工厂，有时甚至一天劳动两班。群众感动地说：“老陈在文化大革命中换了一个人！”一年多来，革委会的七个委员都能做到工作再忙，劳动不误。
    群众的思想革命化，保证了干部的劳动化
    在职干部下车间劳动，能不能真正下得去，做到持之以恒，长年不变？这是一个普遍遇到的问题。
    向东卫生材料厂革委会领导班子深入车间参加生产劳动不久，就出现了不少新的矛盾：一会儿有人来找解决福利问题，一会儿有人来要计划、领材料，机器出了故障要革委会的人去想办法，小组里有人闹纠纷也要革委会的成员去处理……。由于被这些事务工作牵着鼻子走，使一些委员不能安心坚持参加生产劳动。
    怎样跳出事务性的圈子呢？驻厂解放军及时地用毛主席和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的教导武装革委会成员的头脑，向他们介绍部队突出无产阶级政治的先进事例，以自己的切身体会告诉他们，千条万条，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装人们的头脑是第一条。在解放军的帮助下，革委会把活学活用毛泽东思想作为全厂的头等大事来抓，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。革委会的委员们，同生产小组的工人一起学习，一起搞革命大批判，一起亮私斗私，一起开讲用会，解决生产中的问题。烘干车间三班有两个女工吵了起来。在烘干车间三班劳动的革委会副主任董乐群和小组长，学习解放军突出政治的做法组织大家学习毛主席关于“我们的责任，是向人民负责”，“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”和有关批评和自我批评的教导。两位女工用毛主席的教导，以解放军为榜样，对照自己，很快找出了差距，各自做了自我批评。组里的其他同志也热情地指出了她们两人的缺点，使这两个女工在毛泽东思想的指引下更加亲密团结。其他同志也受到了一次深刻的毛泽东思想教育。
    不久，烘干车间三班的这个经验，被全厂各班组普遍运用起来了。同志之间，班组之间有什么问题，能自己解决的都不再找革委会。工人们说：“咱们应该多给领导班子创造活学活用毛主席著作的时间，创造劳动化的条件。革委会的人又要劳动，又要领导全厂的运动和生产。咱们有什么事，自己能解决的，就不要给他们增加负担了。”许多班组和工人群众从这一思想出发，做到问题不出组，矛盾不上交。有一次，厂里的过滤机坏了，工人们想到革委会的人又工作又劳动很紧张，就没有去找他们，自己连夜加班修好了。第二天才对革委会的负责人说明。这件事使革委会的成员深受感动。他们说：要是在过去，机器坏了，要先向厂长打报告，厂长再批转给保全组，保全组再安排修理时间，要动一串人，要开一串会，一耽误就是几天。从这里，他们深深地体会到：靠制度管人，就会忙死人，累死人；突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想武装人们的头脑，促进人的思想革命化，才能保证领导班子有更多的时间和精力参加集体生产劳动，紧密联系群众，更好地抓革命、促生产。事实证明，群众思想革命化能够更好地促进干部迅速实现劳动化。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”一年多来，向东卫生材料厂革委会领导班子最深刻地体会到：干部实现劳动化，是紧密联系群众、依靠群众的重要途径之一。
