In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Lelyang Rice Transplanter Factory in Hunan Province successfully developed the "Dongfeng-2" motorized rice transplanter, which is now being mass-produced.

This transplanter was developed primarily by workers and was successfully tested in six large farms across Guangdong, Hubei, and Hunan provinces in 1967. It underwent trials on over 8,000 mu of early, mid, and late rice fields, proving to have excellent performance. It can transplant 25 mu of rice in eight hours, with good transplanting quality. In November of last year, after being approved by the National Motorized Rice Transplanter Appraisal Conference, it was decided that the Lelyang Rice Transplanter Factory would officially produce it.

Mechanizing rice transplanting labor has been the long-held aspiration of the broad masses of rural commune members in our country. As early as 1956, a carpenter from a poor peasant family in Lelyang County had tried to make a wooden rice transplanter. Later, this carpenter joined the Lelyang County Agricultural Tools Factory's rice transplanter research group and, based on the original wooden transplanter, successfully developed an iron-wood structure, animal-powered rice transplanter. The Dongfeng-2 motorized rice transplanter that was successfully developed this time is the result of the Lelyang Rice Transplanter Factory summarizing and developing the experiences of rice transplanter trials over the years and absorbing the advantages of rice transplanters from other parts of the country. In addition to the revolutionary workers of the Lelyang Rice Transplanter Factory, revolutionary workers from relevant agricultural machinery scientific research units in other regions also participated in this development work.

The revolutionary workers of the Lelyang Rice Transplanter Factory experienced a sharp struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads from the trial production of animal-powered rice transplanters to the development of motorized rice transplanters. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to smash all the tricks and conspiracies of the class enemies attempting to sabotage this research and development work. For example, when the new rice transplanter factory building was about to be completed, Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hunan deliberately withdrew construction funds, moved machinery and equipment, and stopped research funds, attempting to force the research and development of rice transplanters to stop. At this time, the workers studied the brilliant works of Chairman Mao, "Old Three Articles," and related teachings on self-reliance and hard struggle, resolutely smashing the sabotage and interference of the class enemies, allowing the research and development of rice transplanters to continue.

The first motorized rice transplanter of the Lelyang Rice Transplanter Factory was finally developed. In 1966, relevant departments held a national conference to prepare for the centralized typing of six motorized rice transplanters, including Lelyang, from all over the country. However, a small clique of bourgeois technical "authorities" controlling the conference excluded workers, peasants, and revolutionary young technicians. They monopolized the design rights, ignoring the advantages and characteristics of the original six rice transplanters, and designed a so-called "motorized rice transplanter" product type design behind closed doors, attempting to completely strangle the creativity of workers and peasants. At this critical moment, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched with great fanfare. The Lelyang Rice Transplanter Factory and revolutionary workers and young technicians from all over the country, hoisting the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," kicked out the bourgeois technical "authorities" from the conference, determined to concentrate the advantages of various motorized rice transplanters, and design and manufacture motorized rice transplanters with better performance. In the process of development, they held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought actively, carried forward the revolutionary style of the proletariat, and conducted field trials with poor and lower-middle peasants. Finally, they successfully developed the Dongfeng-2 motorized rice transplanter with excellent performance.

    粉碎阶级敌人和资产阶级技术“权威”的破坏和干扰
    耒阳插秧机厂创制成功机动水稻插秧机
    经过大面积试验，性能良好，已成批生产
    新华社长沙十八日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，湖南耒阳插秧机厂创制成功“东风—2型”机动水稻插秧机，现已成批生产。
    这种插秧机是以工人为主研究创制成功的，一九六七年曾在广东、湖北和湖南三个省的六个大型农场里，进行了早、中、晚稻八千多亩田的大面积插秧试验，证明性能良好，每八小时可以插水稻二十五亩左右，插秧质量也比较好。去年十一月，经过全国机动水稻插秧机鉴定会议定型，决定由耒阳插秧机厂正式生产。
    使插秧劳动机械化，是我国农村广大社员多年来的理想。早在一九五六年，耒阳县一个贫农出身的木工就试制过一台木质插秧机。后来，这个木工参加了耒阳县农具厂的插秧机研究小组，又在原来木质插秧机的基础上，试制成功一台铁木结构的、用畜力牵引的插秧机。现在试制成功的东风—2型机动插秧机，是耒阳插秧机厂总结并发展了历年试制插秧机的经验和吸取全国其他水稻插秧机的优点创制成功的。参加这项试制工作的，除耒阳插秧机厂的革命职工外，还有其他地区有关农业机械科学研究单位的革命职工。
    耒阳插秧机厂革命职工从试制畜力插秧机到制成机动插秧机，经历了一场尖锐的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，粉碎了阶级敌人企图破坏这项研究试制工作的一切阴谋诡计。例如，当新的插秧机工厂厂房即将竣工的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖南的代理人故意抽走基建资金，调走机器设备，停发科研经费，企图迫使插秧机的研究试制工作停止下来。这时，职工们学习了伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和有关自力更生、艰苦奋斗的教导，坚决粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏和干扰，使插秧机的研究和试制工作得以继续进行。
    耒阳插秧机厂的第一台机动插秧机终于试制出来了。一九六六年，有关部门召开全国性的会议，准备将包括耒阳在内的来自全国各地的六台机动水稻插秧机在会上集中定型。可是，把持会议的一小撮资产阶级技术“权威”，排斥工农和革命的青年技术人员，他们把持设计大权，抛开原来六部插秧机的优点和特长，关门设计了一种所谓的
  “机动插秧机”产品定型设计，企图把工人、农民的创造完全扼杀。正在这个时候，无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地开展起来了，耒阳插秧机厂和来自全国各地的革命工人、革命的青年技术人员，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，踢开了会议中的资产阶级技术“权威”，决心集中各种机动插秧机的优点，自己设计、制造性能更好的机动插秧机。他们在试制过程中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛泽东思想，发扬无产阶级的革命作风，和贫下中农一起下田试验，终于创制成功了性能良好的东风—2型机动水稻插秧机。
