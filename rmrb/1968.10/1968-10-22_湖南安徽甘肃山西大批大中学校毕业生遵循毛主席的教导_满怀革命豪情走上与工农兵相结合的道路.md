		Large numbers of graduates from colleges and universities in Hunan, Anhui, Gansu, and Shanxi, following Chairman Mao's instructions, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and embarking on the path of integration with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

		Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 21st - Over three thousand graduates from colleges and universities in Hunan Province in 1967 have recently rushed to rural areas and factories to become ordinary farmers and workers. The remaining majority have gone to county-level and lower units, working and laboring while receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

		Revolutionary youngsters who have made great contributions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Before leaving school, they held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes under the leadership of the stationed PLA and worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, severely criticizing the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. Many students in the study classes angrily denounced the harm caused by the revisionist educational line. The stationed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams also organized graduates to visit memorial sites of Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities, learning revolutionary traditions; invited old workers to share their family histories, raising the graduates' proletarian consciousness, and thus further igniting their immense hatred for China's Khrushchev's revisionist line and their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After the great leader Mao Zedong's latest instruction on intellectuals receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers was issued, the graduates were greatly inspired and educated. They said, "Chairman Mao's latest instruction has once again pointed out the direction for us. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to workers, peasants, and soldiers to receive re-education, and in the great storms of revolution, cultivate ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

		Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 21st - Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and a series of latest instructions, over seven thousand graduates from colleges and universities in Anhui Province in 1966 and 1967 have recently rushed to rural areas, border regions, factories, mines, and grassroots units, embarking on the path of integrating with workers and peasants, receiving re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

		Before going down, these graduates all held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and a series of latest instructions, deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism. In the study classes, the graduates, with the line of criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself as the key, carried out activities of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, severely criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in their units who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and graduate allocation line, severely exposing the harm caused by the revisionist educational line, greatly raising their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. They said, "Chairman Mao wants us to integrate with workers and peasants, this is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest trust, and greatest encouragement for us!"

		Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 21st - In the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the great high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, nearly ten thousand graduates from middle schools and over four thousand graduates from colleges and universities in Gansu Province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and have successively embarked on the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are determined to go to workers, peasants, and soldiers to receive re-education, cultivating themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

		Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan - Under the inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals, large numbers of graduates from colleges and universities in Shanxi Province are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and determination, firmly walking the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao, going to rural areas, border regions, factories, mines, and grassroots units, becoming workers and peasants, receiving re-education from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in labor.

		Now, over five thousand graduates from colleges and universities in the province in 1966 and 1967 and over fourteen thousand graduates from middle schools have, according to the needs of the state, mostly set off on new revolutionary journeys.
