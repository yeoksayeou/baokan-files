Communist Party members should be ordinary laborers and servants of the people, or should they be officials and lords? This is the dividing line between Chairman Mao's line on building the Party and China's Khrushchev's revisionist line on building the Party.

"We Communists are not here to be officials, but to make revolution. We must all have a thorough revolutionary spirit and never for a moment leave the masses." Our Party members must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, join the Party for the revolution, and always stay close to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only then can we remain full of vigor and forever retain our revolutionary youth.

However, China's Khrushchev, out of the need to restore capitalism, has always fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's line on building the Party. He has shamelessly promoted his notorious "join the Party to become an official" theory, declaring: "In the past, passing the imperial examination made one an official. Now, joining the Communist Party also makes one an official. Party membership is a list of candidates for cadres."

The "join the Party to become an official" theory is a powerful corrosive agent. It attempts to poison those with weak wills, leading them down the revisionist path of seeking official positions rather than revolution, of being officials rather than serving the people.

Our "May Seventh" cadre school has an old cadre who was a shepherd in his youth and fought in the anti-Japanese war. However, after becoming an "official," he was poisoned by the "join the Party to become an official" theory and gradually took the comfortable path of "making revolution" and being an official and lord. He painfully said: "China's Khrushchev's 'join the Party to become an official' theory almost turned me into a capitalist-roader! Fortunately, Chairman Mao launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which saved me from the revisionist quagmire!"

An official from a petty-bourgeois family, after being poisoned by the "join the Party to become an official" theory, slid further down the revisionist path as his position rose. Summarizing this bitter lesson, he said: "Although I have been in the revolution for 21 years, I never really joined the ranks of the working people, nor did I truly join the revolution! In my soul, I replaced the word 'revolution' with 'becoming an official,' which is why I inevitably slid down the revisionist path."

China's Khrushchev's "join the Party to become an official" theory is entirely for the purpose of restoring capitalism and cultivating successors. He wants to use the "private" thoughts in the minds of some of our Party members, using "becoming an official" as bait, to conspire to turn our Party members into a privileged class that only seeks official positions, to prepare the organization for overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has greatly raised the communist consciousness of the broad masses of Communist Party members, greatly strengthened the ties between the Party and the revolutionary masses, and pulled some Party members who were poisoned by China's Khrushchev's "join the Party to become an official" theory back from the revisionist path. This is a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought that resonates through the clouds.

Chairman Mao has always taught Communist Party members to closely connect with the revolutionary masses, to "face the wind and rain, see the world" in the great storm of the extremely fierce and complex revolutionary mass movement, so as to cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. In 1964, Chairman Mao again solemnly taught: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords riding on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." Recently, Chairman Mao again pointed out:

"Sending a large number of cadres to work in the countryside is a good opportunity for them to learn anew." We "May Seventh" soldiers, through half a year of labor practice, have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's great teachings are fundamental measures to maintain and carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of our Party, and are a long-term strategy for preventing and guarding against revisionism.

What kind of line cultivates what kind of people. Some cadres in organs who have long been poisoned by China's Khrushchev's reactionary line, detached from the masses, detached from reality, and detached from labor, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant "May Seventh" instructions, once they take the path of being sent down to work, changing from the position of being an "official" to that of an ordinary laborer, have undergone a profound "expel the old and take in the new" change in their souls. The remnants of the "join the Party to become an official" theory have been strongly washed away, thoroughly breaking the idea of being able to be an official but not serving the people, and thoroughly establishing the idea of being willing to be an ordinary laborer.

"The basic principle of the Communist Party is to directly rely on the broad revolutionary masses." It is precisely because our Party insists on the path of combining with workers and peasants and closely connecting with the masses that it has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people. An old poor peasant said:

"The 'May Seventh' soldiers have restored the old Eighth Route Army style, working with us and having no official airs. They are closer than brothers and sincerely help us do things well. We want cadres like this!" The old peasant's words are the best praise for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the most powerful criticism of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

We must thoroughly criticize and completely repudiate the "join the Party to become an official" theory! We must thoroughly establish the idea of being willing to be the people's old yellow ox for the revolution!

We should be officials of the proletariat, and such officials can only be servants of the people who serve the laboring people wholeheartedly! We should be ordinary laborers and proletarian revolutionaries! We must walk the brilliant "May Seventh" path to the end, never leaving labor, the masses, or reality, forever being ordinary laborers, forever being proletarian revolutionaries. In this way, we can forever keep up with the majestic steps of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, forever retain our revolutionary youth, and ensure that the proletarian state remains red for thousands of years!

    甘当人民的老黄牛
    ——彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官论”
    黑龙江省柳河“五·七”干校通讯组
    共产党人是当普通劳动者、人民的勤务员，还是当官做老爷？这是毛主席的建党路线和中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的分水岭。
      “我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”我们的党员，只有按照毛主席的教导，为革命而入党，永远同工农兵群众相结合，才能朝气勃勃，永葆革命青春。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫出于复辟资本主义的需要，一贯疯狂反对毛主席的建党路线。他大肆推销臭名昭著的“入党做官论”，无耻地宣扬：“过去考上秀才就可以做官，现在加入了共产党，也可以做官，这个党员就是干部的后备名单。”
    “入党做官论”是一种烈性腐蚀剂，它力图毒害一些意志不坚定的人，要把他们引上只想做官，不想革命，只能为官，不能为民的修正主义道路。
    我们“五·七”干校有一位放羊娃出身的抗日时期老干部，他幼年就给地主放羊，后来也曾在枪林弹雨之中出生入死地干过革命。但是，他当了“官”以后，受了“入党做官论”的毒害，便逐渐走上了舒舒服服“干革命”、当官做老爷的道路。他痛切地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫的‘入党做官论’，险些把我变成一个走资派！多亏毛主席他老人家发动的文化大革命，才把我从修正主义泥坑里救了出来！”
    一个出身于小资产阶级家庭的“三门”干部，在“入党做官论”的毒害下，随着职位的提高，在修正主义道路上越滑越远。他总结这个沉痛的教训时说：“我虽然参加革命二十一年，但是实际上压根儿就没有加入劳动人民的队伍，没有真正加入革命！在灵魂深处已把‘革命’二字换成了‘当官’二字，这是我必然滑向修正主义邪路的原因。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官论”，完全是为复辟资本主义培养接班人的。他就是要利用我们某些党员头脑里的私字，用“当官”做诱饵，阴谋把我们的党员培养成为一心当官的特权阶层，为他颠覆无产阶级专政作组织准备。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，大大提高了广大共产党员的共产主义觉悟，大大密切了党和广大革命人民群众的联系，并把一些受到中国赫鲁晓夫“入党做官论”毒害的共产党员，从滑向修正主义的邪路上拉了回来。这是毛泽东思想的一曲响彻云霄的凯歌。
    毛主席历来教导共产党员要同广大革命群众紧密联系在一起，要在极其剧烈、极其复杂的革命群众运动的伟大风暴中“经风雨，见世面”，这样才能造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人。一九六四年，毛主席又谆谆教导说：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”最近，毛主席又指出：
  “广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会”。我们“五·七”战士，通过半年来的劳动实践，更加深刻体会到毛主席的伟大教导，是保持和发扬我们党的光荣革命传统的根本措施，是反修防修的千年大计、万年大计。
    什么路线培养什么人。一些在中国赫鲁晓夫反动路线毒害下长期脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离劳动的机关干部，在毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示指引下，一经走上下放劳动的道路，从为“官”的地位，变为普通劳动者的地位，就在自己的灵魂深处发生了一场深刻的“吐故纳新”的变化。“入党做官论”的余毒受到了有力的冲刷，大破了只能为官不能为民的思想，大立了甘当普通劳动者的思想感情。
    “共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”正是因为我们党坚持与工农相结合的道路，紧密联系群众，便受到了广大人民群众的热烈欢迎。有位老贫农说：
  “‘五·七’战士又恢复了老八路作风，和我们一样参加劳动，一点官架子也没有，和我们比亲兄弟还亲，实心实意地帮助我们办好事情。我们就是要这样的干部！”老贫农的这一席话，是对毛主席革命路线的最好赞歌，也是对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的最有力的批判。
    我们就是要大破特破、批倒批臭“入党做官论”！我们就是要大立特立为革命甘当人民老黄牛的思想！
    我们当“官”，要当无产阶级之“官”，这种“官”只能是全心全意为劳动人民服务的人民勤务员！我们为民，要做普通劳动者又做无产阶级革命战士！我们要在光辉的“五·七”道路上走到底，永远不脱离劳动，不脱离群众，不脱离实际，永远做一个普通劳动者，永远做一个无产阶级革命战士。这样，我们就能永远跟上无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的雄伟步伐，永葆革命青春，保证无产阶级江山千年万代红彤彤！
