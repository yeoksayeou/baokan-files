Under the warm care of Chairman Mao, the working class has fully exerted its leading role, and the revolutionary production situation in the railway transportation system is excellent.

The workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have fully exerted the leading role of the working class and achieved new victories in seizing the revolution and promoting production. In September, transportation production reached the highest level in more than a year. The task of transporting tens of thousands of passengers traveling south and north and celebrating National Day was also successfully completed.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the working class being the leading class and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters are the great driving force for the workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau to seize the revolution and promote production. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, the revolutionary workers of the entire bureau immediately launch a wave of learning and implementing them. The proletarian headquarters issued new battle tasks to the workers in September, and the Shanghai Railway Bureau and its subordinate bureaus' revolutionary committees immediately mobilized the masses to resolutely complete them. In September, the Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Bengbu bureaus under the Shanghai Railway Bureau all completed their transportation tasks with overfulfillment. Among them, the Shanghai Railway Bureau's cargo handling volume created a record high since liberation. The Nanjing Railway Bureau, while ensuring the railway bridge of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, which was designed and built by Chinese workers, was officially opened to traffic on National Day, also successfully completed the production plan.

The workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, on the one hand, selecting outstanding workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in their respective regions, entering primary and secondary schools and all units that have not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation; on the other hand, seriously carrying out revolutionary criticism, cleaning up class ranks, streamlining organizations, and reforming unreasonable regulations within the unit. After sending a batch of workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, many bureaus, stations, and sections still carried out the revolution vigorously, and production became even more heated.

The revolutionary workers of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," are full of spirit and vigor, and all aspects of transportation production are rising. Based on the fact that the transportation volume in August was several times higher than at the beginning of the year, the transportation production situation in September was further improved, thus ensuring the smooth completion of the transportation tasks of increasingly important materials such as coal, steel, and others. The overall operational order is also relatively good, with the punctuality rates of passenger train departures and operations reaching 99% and 95% respectively.

The revolutionary workers of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on "seriously carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation," took the work team as the starting point and carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. They severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the railway department, and broke the unreasonable regulations that shackle productivity, thereby promoting the development of transportation production. In a previous period, due to the continuous increase in transportation tasks, there was a shortage of locomotives. At this time, the revolutionary workers of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot carried forward the revolutionary pioneering spirit, broke the unreasonable locomotive traction quotas set by the capitalist roaders in the past, and implemented the policy of pulling more and running faster, fully utilizing the traction efficiency of the existing locomotives. The Shenyang Railway Revolutionary Committee, after investigation and research, summarized this advanced experience and actively organized the revolutionary workers of other locomotive depots to learn and promote it, greatly improving the locomotive traction efficiency. From June to now, the entire bureau has not increased the number of locomotives but has transported more than 200,000 tons of additional cargo.

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received the representatives of the national railway and transportation conference in May this year, greatly encouraging the revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau. They followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions such as "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and achieved victories in both revolution and production. Since May, the entire bureau has overfulfilled the transportation plan every month, and the transportation situation has become better and better. The cargo shipment volume in the second quarter was more than 67% higher than in the first quarter, and the third quarter was more than 44% higher than the second quarter. The utilization efficiency of locomotives and vehicles has been significantly improved; overloaded trains are becoming more and more common, and the entire bureau has transported 349,000 tons of overloaded cargo in September alone, equivalent to opening 247 additional trains. Some units have already completed the annual transportation plan ahead of schedule.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Lanzhou Railway Bureau is both vigorous and solid. The workers overcame the objective difficulties of high work mobility, scattered residences, and long service lines, and insisted on carrying out revolutionary criticism with the work team as the main unit. Each train crew, each work area, each small station, and each train organized various criticism meetings according to different situations, and the revolutionary criticism battlefront was set up everywhere, making the revolutionary criticism in the entire bureau continue to deepen and develop.

The revolutionary workers thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi, and established Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many units quickly solved long-standing "difficult" problems, and the revolution ushered in a new situation, while production achieved new successes.

The revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau, while sending a large number of personnel to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, bravely shouldered the double burden of revolution and production, and used their actual actions to support the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering various fields of the superstructure. They voluntarily launched a movement to increase transportation volume and save coal, and production continuously achieved new results.

Since September, the revolutionary workers of the Hohhot Railway Bureau have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions such as "seriously carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation," launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Now, most units in this bureau have achieved streamlined management, with the number of full-time management personnel in the bureau's headquarters reduced by 91.6%, and workers from the grassroots units have been absorbed into the working bodies of the revolutionary committees at all levels. The bureau's revolutionary committee also sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to the grassroots to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, conduct investigations and research, and focus on struggle, criticism, and transformation, changing the past working style of the old organization that did not go deep into the masses and the actual situation.

The victory of the revolution has promoted production. This bureau's transportation production has been rising month by month, and the completion of cargo shipment volume, unloading volume, and various major operational indicators in the third quarter have all exceeded the level of the same period in 1966. From January to September this year, locomotives saved more than 7,000 tons of coal, and the basic construction tasks in September were also overfulfilled. The bureau's revolutionary committee also sent five locomotive train crews and two locomotive repair teams to support the brother railway bureaus.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "the working class must lead everything" were issued, this bureau has already dispatched more than 1,300 outstanding workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, entering primary and secondary schools and some units that have not done a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation. The revolutionary workers are further launching a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation and striving to achieve greater victories in revolution and production.

    在毛主席的亲切关怀下，工人阶级充分发挥领导作用
    铁路运输系统革命生产形势大好
    上海铁路局
    上海铁路局的广大铁路工人，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，取得了抓革命、促生产的新胜利。九月份运输生产，创造了一年多来的最高水平。输送南来北往和欢度国庆的几十万旅客的客运任务也顺利完成。
    毛主席关于工人阶级是领导阶级的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，是上海铁路局广大铁路工人狠抓革命、猛促生产的巨大动力。每当毛主席的最新指示一下达，全局革命职工便立即掀起学习、贯彻的热潮。无产阶级司令部在九月份向广大铁路工人布置了新的战斗任务，上海铁路局和所属分局革委会立即发动广大群众坚决完成。九月份，上海铁路局所属的上海、杭州、南京和蚌埠分局都全面超额完成了运输任务。其中，上海铁路分局的货物装运量，创造了解放十九年来的最高纪录。南京铁路分局在保证我国工人阶级自行设计、自行施工建造的南京长江大桥的铁路桥，在国庆节正式通车的同时，还圆满完成了生产计划。
    上海铁路局广大铁路工人积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，一方面选派优秀工人参加所在地区的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻大中小学和一切没有搞好斗、批、改的单位；一方面在本单位认真搞好革命的大批判、清理阶级队伍、精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度等工作。不少分局、站、段在派出一批工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队以后，革命仍然搞得轰轰烈烈，生产更加热气腾腾。
    沈阳铁路局
    沈阳铁路局广大革命职工，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，意气风发，干劲十足，各项运输生产节节上升。在八月份的运输量比年初有成倍增长的基础上，九月份的运输生产情况又比八月份有进一步的提高，从而保证了日益增长的煤炭、钢铁以及其他重要物资运输任务的顺利完成。全局运行秩序也比较好，客车出发和运行的正点率都分别达到百分之九十九和百分之九十五以上。
    沈阳铁路局广大革命职工遵照毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的教导，以班组为基点，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路部门的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，大破束缚生产力的不合理的规章制度，有力地促进了运输生产的发展。前一个时期，由于运输任务不断增加，机车感到不足，这时苏家屯机务段革命职工发扬革命首创精神，打破了走资派过去规定的不合理的机车牵引定额，实行多拉快跑，充分发挥了现有机车的牵引效率。沈阳铁路局革命委员会经过调查研究，总结了这个先进经验，并积极组织其他机务段的革命职工学习推广，机车牵引效率大大提高。从六月份到现在，全局没增机车，就多运输了二百多万吨货物。
    兰州铁路局
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席今年五月接见全国铁路、交通会议代表，极大地鼓舞了兰州铁路局的广大革命职工。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”等一系列最新指示，取得了革命、生产双胜利。从五月份以来，全局月月超额完成运输计划，运输情况越来越好。全局第二季度货物发送量比第一季度增长百分之六十七以上，第三季度又比第二季度增长百分之四十四以上。机车和车辆运用效率大幅度提高；超轴运输的列车越来越多，全局只是九月份超轴运输的货物就达三十四万九千多吨，等于多开二百四十七个列车。有些单位已经提前完成全年的运输计划。
    兰州铁路局的文化大革命运动搞得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。广大职工克服了工作流动性大，居住分散，服务的线路长等客观困难，坚持开展以班组为主的革命大批判，每个包车组、每个工区、每个小站、每趟列车，都根据不同情况，组织各种批判会，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场，使全局革命大批判不断深入发展。
    广大革命职工大破中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的革命路线。许多单位长期解决不了的“老大难”问题很快得到了解决，革命出现了新局面，生产取得了新成就。
    兰州铁路局的革命职工，在抽出大批人员参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的情况下，勇于挑起革命生产两副重担，用自己的实际行动支持工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上层建筑各个领域。他们自觉地掀起了增强运量，节省煤炭的增产节约运动，生产不断取得新的成绩。
    呼和浩特铁路局
    九月份以来，呼和浩特铁路局广大革命职工遵照毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”等一系列最新指示，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。现在，这个局绝大多数单位实现了精兵简政，局机关脱产管理人员精减了百分之九十一点六，并且吸收基层单位的工人参加了各级革命委员会办事机构的工作。局革委会还派出毛泽东思想宣传队深入基层宣传毛泽东思想，进行调查研究，狠抓斗、批、改，改变了过去旧机构不深入群众、不深入实际的工作作风。
    革命的胜利发展促进了生产。这个局今年运输生产月月上升，第三季度货物发送量、卸车量和各项主要运行指标的完成情况，都超过了一九六六年同期的水平。今年一到九月份，机车节约煤炭七千多吨，九月份的基本建设任务也超额完成。局革委会还先后派出五个机车包车队和两个机车检修队，支援了兄弟铁路局。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示发表后，这个局已抽调一千三百多名优秀工人参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队，开进大、中、小学校和一些没有搞好斗、批、改的单位。广大革命职工正进一步掀起斗、批、改的高潮，为夺取革命和生产的更大胜利而努力奋斗。          （据新华社）
