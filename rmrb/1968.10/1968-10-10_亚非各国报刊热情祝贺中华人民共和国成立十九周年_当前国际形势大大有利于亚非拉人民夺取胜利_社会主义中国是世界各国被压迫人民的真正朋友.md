Newspapers in Asia and Africa have warmly congratulated the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. They believe that the current international situation is highly favorable for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to achieve victory. They also affirm that socialist China is a true friend of the oppressed peoples of all countries.

According to a summary from Xinhua News Agency:

The *Morning News* of Dhaka, East Pakistan, published an editorial on October 1st congratulating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The editorial stated: "The ties between China and Pakistan are not only friendly and strong but are also continuously growing." The editorial said: "In our time of trouble, some so-called friends stood by and watched, while China stood firmly by our side. We will never forget a country that has proven itself to be a friend in times of trouble. We will forever be grateful to it."

The *Mountain News* of Rawalpindi published an editorial on October 2nd stating that the friendly and cooperative relationship between Pakistan and China is continuously developing. India, which is the enemy of Pakistan's existence, is also the enemy of Sino-Pakistani friendship. India continuously engages in malicious propaganda, attempting to sabotage Sino-Pakistani friendship. The Pakistani people fully understand the cunning tricks of the treacherous enemy. They cherish Sino-Pakistani friendship even more and condemn all malicious anti-China propaganda.

The *Fighting News* of Rawalpindi published an editorial on October 2nd stating: "The People's Republic of China has consistently supported the right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination, not only in words but also in deeds." The editorial said: "Pakistan will always remain vigilant and foil all malicious attempts to sabotage Sino-Pakistani friendship."

The *Nepal Language News* published an editorial expressing gratitude for China's assistance in Nepal's development work.

The *Motherland* Weekly published an editorial stating that China's great achievements are a great encouragement to countries suffering from imperialist and colonialist oppression. The editorial said that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, are becoming stronger and stronger, which is also an encouragement to the people of the whole world.

A friend living in southern Nepal wrote a letter to Xinhua News Agency saying that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved one victory after another in the construction of their motherland, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will also achieve complete victory, which is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Some Nepalese students jointly wrote a letter to Xinhua News Agency saying that the Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not only striving to build a great socialist motherland but also resolutely support the oppressed peoples in their struggle against American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. They shouted in their letter: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The official publication of the Somali Writers' Association, *New Ideas*, sent a congratulatory letter to the Chinese people saying: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, through armed struggle, achieved revolutionary victories against imperialism, feudalism, capitalism, and their running dogs, the Kuomintang, setting a brilliant example for us."

The letter pointed out that the Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are advancing according to Chairman Mao's deployment and have already won the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now the whole of China is a sea of red. The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high across the whole of China.

The letter pointed out that the current international situation is highly favorable for the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to achieve victory. As long as the people of the world grasp Mao Zedong Thought, their victory is undoubtedly inevitable.

The *Public Opinion* of Sudan published an article pointing out: "China is the true friend of the Arab people. Its stance on the Arab issue is clear. It has not only formally declared on many occasions its complete support for the struggle of the Arab people against American imperialism and Israel, but it also supports all national liberation movements. It resolutely opposes American imperialism, the number one enemy of all freedom-loving peoples."

The *Masses Daily* of Sudan published an article under the title "The Role of the People's Republic of China in Supporting National Liberation Movements" on October 3rd, stating: The victory of the Chinese revolution is also our victory. It has set a good example for all struggling peoples.

The article said: "China strongly opposes its enemies and wholeheartedly supports its friends. Despite the imperialists' attempts to hinder China's progress, today China is advancing victoriously in all fields. China's progress has set an example for all struggling peoples, showing them how a country can advance in the face of the numerous difficulties created by imperialism."

The newspaper also published an article titled "Congratulations to the Chinese People on the 19th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" expressing "good wishes to the great Chinese people and their revolutionary leader Chairman Mao Zedong."

The article said: "History will not retreat. The forces that love peace will surely achieve the final victory. Imperialism and all reactionaries will be thoroughly eliminated."

    亚非各国报刊热情祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年
    当前国际形势大大有利于亚非拉人民夺取胜利
    社会主义中国是世界各国被压迫人民的真正朋友
    综合新华社消息：巴基斯坦的东巴基斯坦达卡的《晨报》一日发表社论祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年。社论说：“中国和巴基斯坦两国之间的联系不仅是友好和坚强的，而且在不断增长。”社论说：“在我们的患难时刻，一些所谓的朋友袖手旁观，而中国却坚定地站在我们一边。我们永远不会忘记一个以行动证明是患难朋友的国家。我们将永远感激它。”
    拉瓦尔品第《山岳报》二日发表社论说，巴基斯坦和中国之间的睦邻和友好合作的关系不断发展。印度既是巴基斯坦生存的敌人，也是巴中友好的敌人。印度不断进行恶毒的宣传，企图破坏巴中友谊。巴基斯坦人民完全懂得狡猾的敌人所玩弄的阴谋诡计。他们以更加关切的心情珍视巴中友谊，谴责一切恶毒的反华宣传。
    拉瓦尔品第《战斗报》二日发表社论说：“中华人民共和国一贯支持克什米尔人民的自决权，不仅在口头上，而且在行动上证实了这一点。”社论说：“巴基斯坦将随时保持警惕，将挫败一切阴谋破坏巴中友谊的恶毒意图。”
    尼泊尔《尼泊尔语言报》在社论中对中国在尼泊尔发展工作中给予的援助表示感谢。
    《祖国》周刊发表社论说，中国所取得的巨大成就是对遭受帝国主义和殖民主义压迫的国家的巨大鼓舞。社论说，中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，越来越强大，这也是对全世界人民的鼓舞。
    住在尼泊尔南部的一位朋友在给新华社的一封信中说，在毛主席领导下，中国人民在祖国建设中取得了一个又一个的胜利，无产阶级文化大革命也将获得全面胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    一些尼泊尔学生联名写信给新华社说，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民不仅努力建设伟大的社会主义祖国，而且坚决支持被压迫人民反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的斗争。他们在信中高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    索马里作家协会机关刊物《新思想》在一封给中国人民的贺信中说：“毛泽东主席领导着中国人民通过武装斗争，反对帝国主义，封建主义和资本主义及其走狗国民党所取得的革命胜利，为我们树立了光辉榜样。”
    贺信指出，中国人民在毛泽东思想的指引下，正按照毛主席的部署前进，并已赢得无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。现在全中国是一片鲜红。毛泽东思想的红旗在全中国高高飘扬。
    贺信指出，当前现代修正主义者和帝国主义者正互相勾结，但是，当前的国际形势，大大有利于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命人民夺取胜利。只要全世界人民掌握了毛泽东思想，那么他们的胜利就必定是毫无疑义的。
    苏丹《舆论报》在一篇文章中指出：“中国是阿拉伯人民的真正的朋友，它对阿拉伯问题的立场是明确的，它不只一次地正式宣布完全支持阿拉伯人民反对美帝和以色列的斗争。”“中国还支持一切民族解放运动，它坚决反对一切爱好自由的人民的头号敌人美帝国主义。”
    苏丹《群众日报》三日在《中华人民共和国在支持民族运动中的作用》的标题下写道：中国革命的胜利，也是我们的胜利，它为所有斗争中的人民树立了良好的榜样。
    文章说：“中国强有力地反对它的敌人，全心全意地支持它的朋友。尽管帝国主义想方设法阻挠中国前进，但是，今天中国已经在各个领域里胜利前进。中国的前进为所有斗争中的人民树立了典范，告诉人们一个国家在帝国主义制造的重重困难面前如何前进。”
    这家报纸还在一篇题为《为中华人民共和国成立十九周年向中国人民祝贺》的文章中表示“向伟大的中国人民和他们的革命领袖毛泽东主席致以良好的祝愿。”
    文章说：“历史不会倒退，爱好和平的力量必将取得最后胜利，帝国主义和一切反动派必将被彻底消灭。”
