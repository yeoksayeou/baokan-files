The east wind brings good news from afar,
Chairman Mao's latest directive has been issued,
Billions of soldiers and civilians cheer together:
Cadres going down to the countryside to work is good!

Cadres going down to the countryside to work is good,
The "May 7th" directive shines with golden light,
Word by word, it paves the way for the anti-revisionist revolution,
Sentence by sentence, it nurtures new sprouts.

Cadres going down to the countryside to work is good,
Fighting side by side with the broad masses,
Iron hoes and silver spades dig up the roots of revisionism,
A red flag flies in our hearts.

Cadres going down to the countryside to work is good,
Walking in step and beating as one heart with the working people,
Being both an "official" and a common person,
Standing at the forefront of the three great revolutionary movements.

Cadres going down to the countryside to work is good,
Sweeping away the dust on our bodies,
Rolling in the mud of intense struggle,
Transforming our spiritual world.

Cadres going down to the countryside to work is good,
Coming through wind and waves to be transformed,
Preserving revolutionary youth to fight,
Sweeping away bureaucratic and conservative attitudes.

Cadres going down to the countryside to work is good,
We will definitely follow the path Chairman Mao has pointed out,
Resolutely fighting the battle of the "Three Reforms" (struggle, criticism, and transformation),
Forever safeguarding the red mountains and rivers for ten thousand generations.

    干部下放劳动就是好
    辽宁省新民县公社社员　王善同
    东风万里送喜报，
    毛主席最新指示发表了，
    亿万军民齐欢呼：
    干部下放劳动就是好！
    干部下放劳动就是好，
    “五·七”指示金光耀，
    一字字，铺开防修反修革命路，
    一句句，阳光雨露育新苗。
    干部下放劳动就是好，
    同广大群众战斗在一道，
    铁镐银锄铲“修”根，
    一面红旗心头飘。
    干部下放劳动就是好，
    和劳动人民步同跨呵心同跳，
    既当“官”，又当老百姓，
    三大革命站前哨。
    干部下放劳动就是好，
    身上灰尘狠狠扫，
    火热斗争中滚一身泥巴，
    精神世界换新貌。
    干部下放劳动就是好，
    风里浪里来改造，
    永葆革命青春去战斗，
    官气暮气全打掉。
    干部下放劳动就是好，
    毛主席指的路咱走定了，
    坚决打好斗批改这一仗，
    永保红色江山万代牢。
