Currently, the broad masses of commune members in the cotton-producing areas, with boundless love for Chairman Mao, have launched a campaign to pick, dry, sort, and sell cotton quickly.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 26 — One of China's major cotton-producing areas, Jiangsu Province, is expected to achieve another bumper harvest of cotton this year, with over 80 million mu. At present, the broad masses of commune members in the cotton-producing areas, with boundless love for Chairman Mao, are following Chairman Mao's instruction to "ensure that cotton is given priority" and have launched a campaign to pick, dry, sort, and sell cotton quickly. They say that achieving a bumper cotton harvest is a glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao. The more cotton we produce and the more we sell to the state, the greater our contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to the cause of socialist construction.

A ship needs a helmsman to navigate the seas, and revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at various levels and with the active assistance of the People's Liberation Army, have set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes during the cotton production process. They have used the fields, courtyards, and homes as their battlefields to study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and his series of instructions such as "ensure that cotton is given priority" and "learn from Dazhai in agriculture." They have launched a thorough and sustained criticism of the fallacies spread by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as "to get rich, grow cotton," "material incentives," and "work points as the key." Through deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, further establishing the idea of having a heart for the country and an eye on the world, growing cotton for the revolution. They have overcome natural disasters such as droughts and floods, strengthened the management of cotton fields, and with their hard work, have achieved a bumper cotton harvest this year.

    江苏八百多万亩棉花将获大丰收
    目前，棉产区广大社员怀着对毛主席无限热爱的感情，掀起快摘、快晒、快拣、快售的热潮
    新华社南京二十六日电  我国重要棉产区之一的江苏省，今年八百多万亩棉花又将获得大丰收。目前，棉区广大社员怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，遵照毛主席“必须把棉花抓紧”的教导，掀起了快摘、快晒、快拣、快售的热潮。他们说，夺取棉花丰收，是毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。我们多增产一斤棉花，多向国家交售一斤棉花，就是对无产阶级文化大革命和国家的社会主义建设事业多作一分贡献。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。江苏棉区广大贫下中农和革命干部，在各级革命委员会的领导和人民解放军的大力帮助下，在棉花生产过程中大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，以田头、场头、家庭为阵地，活学活用毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和“必须把棉花抓紧”、“农业学大寨”等一系列指示，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的“要发家，种棉花”、“物质刺激”和“工分挂帅”等谬论。通过深入持久的革命大批判，广大贫下中农提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步树立了胸怀祖国，放眼世界，为革命种棉的思想。他们克服了干旱、雨涝等自然灾害，加强棉田管理，用辛勤的劳动，夺得了今年棉花的大丰收。
