On the occasion of celebrating the nineteenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I am filled with immense joy and profound respect as I once again stand on Tiananmen Square to see our great leader Chairman Mao, and to hear the great call issued by Comrade Lin, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms. This is the greatest happiness and the greatest honor for us poor and lower-middle peasants! I shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Every year brings a joyous festival, but this year's grand celebration is different from all the others. Under your wise leadership, after more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have overthrown the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their local agents, and have seized back part of the leadership power they usurped. Now, except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees have been established throughout the country, and the entire nation is red. Looking at the unprecedentedly good situation before us, how can we not be overjoyed from the bottom of our hearts!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your great teachings on "the working class must lead everything" and "the proletariat must exercise dictatorship over the bourgeoisie in the superstructure, including all cultural domains" have struck a chord in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We enthusiastically support and resolutely carry out these teachings to the letter. The experience of our revolution over the past few decades has repeatedly proven: "Without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail; with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." We poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest understanding of this teaching. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new phase. We will definitely, under the leadership of the working class, be the most reliable allies of the working class, fully implement your instructions, and in the countryside, further launch a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will manage schools well and seize back all the cultural and educational domains and other superstructure positions in the countryside that were once controlled by the bourgeoisie, and we will not allow them to occupy these positions again to harm the country and the people.

On this grand occasion of national celebration, nearly ten thousand outstanding representatives of the working class from all over the country have come to Chairman Mao's side as the leading class to participate in the National Day celebrations. This is an unprecedented event in human history. Capitalist countries will not have it, and the Soviet Union, which is ruled by Khrushchev revisionism, will not have it either. Only a country with proletarian dictatorship built on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will have it. I saw the outstanding representatives of the working-class elders, and they all brought the fruits of revolutionary and productive victories to express their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. This is a good opportunity for us to learn from the working class. I am determined to bring back the working class's boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, their thorough revolutionary spirit, and many valuable experiences to our Dazhai and Xiyang County, and let them blossom and bear fruit. This summer, although Dazhai suffered a rare and severe hailstorm, we relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, and still achieved a good harvest in the autumn. In the future, we will continue to take the working-class elders as our example, grasp the revolution, promote production, fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure, do a good job in autumn harvest, autumn sowing, and autumn plowing, further reform the farming system, strive for continuous bumper harvests in agriculture, produce more grain, and more industrial raw materials to support industry, support national defense, support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression, and support world revolution.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Trees have roots, and water has its source. All our achievements are the result of your wise leadership. In the future, we will definitely follow your great strategic deployment more closely, faithfully carry out your proletarian revolutionary line, and achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    作工人阶级最可靠的同盟军
    陈永贵
    在举国欢庆中华人民共和国成立十九周年的大喜日子里，我怀着万分高兴和无比崇敬的心情，又一次在天安门上见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席，并且听到了毛主席的亲密战友林副主席向我们发出的伟大号令。这是我们贫下中农最大的幸福，最大的光荣！我千遍万遍地高呼：敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！喜庆的节日年年有，今年的这个盛大节日和往年大不一样。在您老人家的英明领导下，经过了两年多无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，我们打倒了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人，夺回了被他们篡夺的那一部分领导权。现在，全国除台湾省外各省、市、自治区普遍成立了革命委员会，全国山河一片红。看看面前空前未有的一片大好形势，怎么能不从心眼里高兴！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”和“无产阶级必须在上层建筑其中包括各个文化领域中对资产阶级实行全面的专政”的伟大教导句句说到了我们贫下中农的心坎里。我们热烈拥护，坚决执行，彻底照办。我国革命几十年的经验，都一再证明：“没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”我们贫下中农对于您的这一教导体会得最深刻。当前，无产阶级文化大革命进入了新的时期。我们一定在工人阶级的领导下，当好工人阶级最可靠的同盟军，全面落实您的指示，在农村中进一步掀起斗、批、改高潮，管理好学校，把农村中被资产阶级统治的文化教育和一切上层建筑阵地统统夺回来，决不允许他们再霸占这些阵地来祸国殃民。
    在今年这个全国欢庆的盛大节日里，全国各地近一万名工人阶级的优秀代表，以领导阶级的身份，来到毛主席身边，参加国庆观礼。这是人类历史上没有过的大事，资本主义国家不会有，被赫鲁晓夫修正主义统治的苏联也不会有，只有用马列主义、毛泽东思想创建的无产阶级专政的国家才会有。我见到了工人老大哥的优秀代表，他们都满载着革命、生产的胜利成果，来向伟大领袖毛主席表忠心。这是我们向工人阶级学习的好机会。我下决心要把工人阶级对毛主席的无限忠诚，把他们的彻底革命精神和许多宝贵经验带回去，让它在我们大寨、在昔阳县开花结果。今年夏季我们大寨虽然遭受了历史上少有的严重雹灾，但是我们靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，秋季仍然夺得了一个好收成。今后，我们要继续以工人老大哥为榜样，抓革命，促生产，打好上层建筑斗、批、改这一仗，搞好秋收、秋种、秋耕，进一步改革耕作制度，争取农业生产的连续丰收，多打粮食，多产工业原料，支援工业，支援国防，支援越南人民的抗美斗争，支援世界革命。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！树有根，水有源，我们取得的一切成就都是您英明领导的结果。今后，我们一定要更加紧跟您的伟大战略部署，忠实执行您的无产阶级革命路线，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中立新功！
