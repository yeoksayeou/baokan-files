Title: Song of the Bridge Builders

Edition: 4

	Bridge builders have grand aspirations,
	The Yangtze River's waves surge in all directions.
	The red sun rises from the Eastern Sea,
	Sunflowers turn towards the sun.
	Bridge builders' hearts are with the Party,
	Armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
	They fearlessly cross treacherous passes,
	No rivers or mountains can block their way.
	Red flags fly over high mountains and long rivers,
	They are heroes on the revolutionary path.
	Their heads touch the sky filled with clouds,
	Their feet tread on endless waves.
	Winds and thunder from all continents are in their sight,
	Waves from the four seas surge in their chests.
	Once they drank by the Yellow River,
	Today they brandish their swords over the Yangtze River.
	Bridge builders traverse the world,
	The five lakes and four seas are their hometowns.
	Drums beat in the river's heart,
	The sound of thunder echoes for thousands of miles.
	Piles of beams like a forest, flags like the sea,
	Machines roar with triumphant songs.
	Pillars are built in front of the crystal palace,
	Bridges are constructed in the depths of the clouds.
	Bridge builders have grand aspirations,
	They dare to transform the mountains and rivers.

### 桥工之歌
扬子浪

专栏：南京长江大桥工地诗选

    建桥工人多奇志
    四处　扬子浪
    红日出东海，
    葵花向太阳。
    桥梁工人心向党，
    毛泽东思想来武装。
    雄关险道任飞渡，
    万水千山无阻挡。
    高山长河插红旗，
    革命路上当闯将。
    头顶满天霞，
    脚踩万顷浪。
    五洲风雷收眼底，
    四海云水涌胸膛。
    当年饮马黄河畔，
    今日挥戈扬子江。
    桥梁工人走天下，
    五湖四海是家乡。
    江心擂战鼓，
    万里风雷响。
    扒杆如林旗如海，
    机器轰鸣凯歌壮。
    水晶宫前筑墩柱，
    白云深处架桥梁。
    建桥工人多奇志，
    敢教山河换新装。
