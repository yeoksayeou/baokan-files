The broad masses of poor herdsmen and revolutionary cadres in Qinghai Province, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," have, after a year of hard struggle, overcome various natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest of wool products. Currently, the wool already purchased across the province is 12 percent higher than the same period last year, which had the highest production in history. Wool, cashmere, cow hair, and camel hair, and other livestock products have also seen a bumper harvest.

Various relevant departments in Qinghai have followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to link up with the masses." During the shearing season this year, they sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams multiple times, carrying Chairman Mao's works and various new shearing tools, to go deep into the vast pastoral areas. Together with the masses, they actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the people, and study new shearing methods with the herdsmen. They continually improve shearing techniques, significantly increasing the production and quality of wool and other livestock products.

    青海羊毛产品获得特大丰收
    青海省广大贫苦牧民和革命干部，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，经过一年来的艰苦奋斗，战胜各种自然灾害，夺取了羊毛产品的特大丰收。目前全省已收购的羊毛，比历史上产量最高的去年同期还增长百分之十二。羊绒、牛毛绒和驼毛等畜产品也获得丰收。
    青海各级有关部门遵照毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，在今年剪毛季节，多次派出毛泽东思想宣传队，带着毛主席著作和各种新式剪毛工具，深入广大牧区，和广大群众一道活学活用毛泽东思想，热情地向群众宣传毛泽东思想，同牧民一起研究新的剪毛方法，不断改进剪毛技术，大大提高了羊毛等畜产品的产量和质量。
