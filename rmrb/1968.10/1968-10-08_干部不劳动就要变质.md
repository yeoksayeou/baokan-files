Cadres Who Do Not Labor Will Degenerate

Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Kaiyang County, Guizhou Province, Tian Yingfeng

Great Leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "A large number of cadres should be sent down to labor. This is an excellent opportunity for cadres to re-learn. Except for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also be sent down in batches to labor." Chairman Mao's instruction is like a guiding light, illuminating the path for all cadres, and is a long-term strategy for opposing revisionism and preventing revisionism. It is an important way to re-educate cadres and cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. Only by strictly implementing Chairman Mao's important instruction can cadres maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people, and ensure that our socialist state will never change color.

After studying Chairman Mao's latest instruction, reflecting on my own journey, I deeply feel that: detachment from labor is the beginning of changing one's color. Even if one is a worker or peasant cadre, long-term detachment from labor will also lead to change.

I was born into a poor peasant family and started working at a young age. However, after joining the revolutionary work, over the past decade, because I have been sitting in the office all day, I have not participated in labor, and my thoughts and feelings have changed. I gradually forgot the hardships of the past, eating coarse grains and wearing straw shoes, while bourgeois thoughts of enjoying good food and fine clothing gradually grew. Later, when I became a member of the old county committee, my status became higher, and my airs became greater. I could not listen to the words of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and my thoughts became more and more distant from them. Therefore, I made many mistakes in my work, causing some damage to the revolutionary cause.

At one time, I also thought that this long-term office work, detached from labor and the masses, should be changed. I made up my mind, wrote a report, and applied to settle down in the countryside to engage in both labor and leadership work. However, the walking capitalist roaders in the old county committee stubbornly pursued the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Khrushchev, not only did they not support my revolutionary request, but they also glared at me and shouted, "You don't want to revolutionize anymore!" It was clear that in their eyes, "revolution" meant being an official, and farming was not considered revolutionary.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the education and help of the revolutionary masses, I seriously studied Chairman Mao's works and his instructions on cadres participating in labor, carefully examined the reasons for my various mistakes, and realized that: the most important reason for making mistakes was detachment from labor and the masses. To thoroughly change old thoughts and old styles, one must often participate in labor. Therefore, I applied again to settle down in the countryside. The provincial revolutionary committee quickly approved my application. On March 19th of this year, I came to Shao Shang Commune, Tuqiao Brigade, Shankou Production Team to settle down with a Red Guard. Over the past few months, because I have studied Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants, eaten, lived, and worked together, my hands have become calloused, my old thoughts have decreased, and the distance from the masses has shortened. Therefore, my class feelings with the laboring people have become deeper. Many poor and lower-middle peasants are willing to express their opinions to me, and they like to share their hearts with me, making me understand many new situations and problems that I could not understand in the office.

In the past, some people were worried that long-term labor in the production team would affect the work of the entire county? In the past, I also had such concerns, but after I visited Dazhai in Shanxi Province, this concern was completely dispelled. Comrade Chen Yonggui did not detach himself from labor, but he handled the work of the province and the county very well. In the county, I am in charge of the production leadership group. Every ten days or half a month, I return to the county to discuss and arrange work once, and then return to the production team to labor. Both sides will not be neglected. In the past, when I was in the county, every time I studied work, I always felt empty inside. Now, with first-hand materials, I have a solid foundation and dare to make decisions. The past few months have proven that responsible comrades laboring at fixed points do not weaken overall work but strengthen it.

"Cadres in office should also be sent down in batches to labor." I am determined to use Chairman Mao's latest instruction as a guideline, to always take root among the masses, to stand on the front line of the three great revolutionary struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and to temper a heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao in the great storms of the masses' struggle. To be both an "official" and a common person, to dedicate oneself to the people as an old yellow cow for life!

    干部不劳动就要变质
    贵州省开阳县革命委员会副主任　田应丰
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”毛主席这一指示，象一盏指路明灯，照亮了广大干部前进的方向，是反修、防修的百年大计，是重新教育干部、培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要途径。只有不折不扣地贯彻毛主席的这一重要指示，干部才能同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，才能保证我们的社会主义江山永不变色。
    学习了毛主席这一最新指示，回顾自己走过的道路，我深深感到：脱离劳动就是改变颜色的开始，即使是工农干部，长期脱离劳动也会变。
    我出身在贫农家庭，从小参加劳动，但是参加革命工作以后，十多年来，由于整天蹲办公室，没有参加劳动，思想感情就发生了变化，对过去吃糠菜、穿草鞋的苦难生活渐渐地忘记了，而好吃好穿的资产阶级思想渐渐增长了。后来当上旧县委常委，“官”做大了，架子也大了，贫下中农的话听不进去，思想上同贫下中农越来越疏远。因此，在工作中犯了不少错误，给革命事业造成一定损失。
    有一个时期，我也曾经想过，这样长期坐机关，脱离劳动，脱离群众的工作作风应该改变，我下决心，写了个报告，申请到农村安家落户，以便边劳动，边搞领导工作。那知道，旧县委里的走资派顽固推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，不仅不支持我的革命要求，反而瞪起眼睛大叫：“你不想革命了！”很明显，在他们的眼睛里，“革命”就是做官，种田就算不上革命。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，在无产阶级革命派的教育和帮助下，我认真学习了毛主席著作和毛主席关于干部参加劳动的教导，仔细寻找自己犯这样那样错误的原因，认识到：犯错误的最重要原因，就是脱离劳动，脱离群众。要彻底改变旧思想，旧作风，就必须经常参加劳动。于是，我又提出申请，要求到农村安家落户。省革委会很快批准了我的申请，今年三月十九日，我同一位红卫兵小将共同来到哨上公社土桥大队山口生产队安家落户。几个月来，由于跟贫下中农共同学习毛主席著作，同吃、同住、同劳动，手上的茧增厚了，脑袋里的旧思想减少了，与群众的距离缩短了，因此，同劳动人民的阶级感情越来越深厚了。许多贫下中农有意见肯向我提，知心话爱跟我讲，使我了解到很多在机关了解不到的新情况、新问题。
    过去，有人担心，长期在生产队里劳动，全县的工作还能管吗？从前，我也有过这样的顾虑，但是自从我到山西大寨参观回来以后，这个顾虑就完全打消了。陈永贵同志没有脱离劳动，可是他所担负的省里、县里的工作都搞得很出色。在县里，我分管生产领导小组，每十天半月回县讨论安排一次工作，再回到生产队里劳动，两边都不会耽误。以前，蹲在县里，每逢研究工作总觉得心里是空的，现在，有第一手材料，心里有底，敢于下决心。几个月的事实证明，负责同志定点劳动，对全面工作不是削弱，而是加强。
    “在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”我决心以毛主席的最新指示为指针，永远扎根在群众之中，站在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命的第一线，在群众斗争的大风大浪里，锤炼一颗永远忠于毛主席的红心。既当“官”，又当老百姓，全心全意为人民当一辈子老黄牛！　    （新华社）
