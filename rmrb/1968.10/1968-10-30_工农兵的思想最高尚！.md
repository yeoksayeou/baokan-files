The incident happened on a Sunday afternoon. Soldiers Zhou Yunrui and Zhang Dianzhou of the People's Liberation Army, who were part of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Shanghai Wenli Middle School, helped wash dishes after eating lunch. Zhang Dianzhou noticed that some students and teachers had left food uneaten and thrown their bowls into the dishwashing bucket. Seeing this, Zhang felt a pang of pain in his heart. He thought of his family's hardships before liberation and Chairman Mao's teachings on "saving every penny for the war and revolutionary cause." Without a word, he fished out the leftover food, washed it, and ate it. A student asked him why he did this, and Zhang replied, "Before liberation, my parents begged for food, but they couldn't even get the rice from the dishwashing bucket!" The student was so moved that he burst into tears. Worker propaganda team member Shuai Zhenguo, who witnessed the scene, was deeply moved. He immediately convened a meeting with the worker propaganda team, teachers, and students to use this incident to educate the school's faculty and students. He said excitedly, "In the old society, the working people couldn't even get the rice bran and husks! We shouldn't underestimate that he only ate a few grains of leftover food; it reflects the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army's hard work and simplicity!"

In the past, some teachers and students, influenced by the revisionist educational line, looked down on workers and peasants and despised labor. Some, incited by bad elements, casually damaged and wasted state property. Zhang Dianzhou, Zhou Yunrui, and other soldiers who came to this school were filled with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people wholeheartedly. After arriving at the school, their first task was to help the school set up a revolutionary environment. Their first lesson was to learn from the working class, actively cooperating with the worker propaganda team to establish "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University"-style Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the revolutionary teachers and students, helping them raise their political awareness. They regarded the worker propaganda team's hard work, simplicity, thrift, and public-spiritedness as the best education for themselves and the students. Every day, they woke up early to sweep the school, wipe the tables, and clean the windows. They helped the cafeteria wash dishes, always looking for things to do, working while chatting with the teachers and students. Some students excitedly said, "The People's Liberation Army is heart-to-heart with us. With the worker propaganda team and the People's Liberation Army, the educational revolution in the school will definitely succeed!"

Zhang's actions caused a great stir. Many workers brought this incident to the factory for propaganda. In the school's "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University"-style Mao Zedong Thought study classes, teachers and students held lively discussions and put up blackboard newspapers. Many teachers and students voluntarily conducted self-examinations and struggled against their selfishness and revisionism. They said, "In the past, Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the school corrupted and poisoned us with bourgeois ideology, making us detached from politics, reality, and labor, and our thoughts and feelings were out of touch with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Today, Chairman Mao has sent the worker propaganda team and the People's Liberation Army to lead us. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations. Under the leadership of the working class, we will definitely carry out the educational revolution to the end!" Some teachers said, "The thoughts of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the most noble! We must sincerely accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers!" Under the influence of the worker propaganda team and the soldiers, the school saw a new trend of hard work and simplicity. Revolutionary teachers and students regarded cultivating the good style of hard work and simplicity as a practical action to learn from the working class and the People's Liberation Army.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the soldiers stationed at Shanghai Datong Middle School quickly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, rectified the school's atmosphere, and established a new revolutionary order, opening up a lively and vibrant new situation for the school's educational revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students joyfully said, "The working class is truly our good teacher." They all signed "Support and Learn from Workers' Pacts" to give to the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, expressing their determination to accept the re-education of the working class.

### “工农兵的思想最高尚！”

    “工农兵的思想最高尚！”
    事情发生在一个星期日的中午。配合工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上海市文治中学的人民解放军战士周云贵和张殿周同志吃过饭就帮助伙房洗碗去了。张殿周同志在洗碗的时候发现，有的师生饭没有吃干净，就把碗丢进了洗碗桶。小张看在眼里，痛在心里。他想到解放前自己家里的苦难史，想到毛主席关于“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业”的教导，便不声不响地把饭捞起来洗洗吃了。一位学生问他为什么这样做，张殿周同志说：“解放前，我父母要饭时，连洗碗桶里的米也要不到！”这位学生感动得哭了。在场的工人宣传队帅正国同志目睹这一情景，心情非常激动，立即召集工人宣传队、学校的教师和学生开了一个现场会，用这件事对学校师生进行了一次生动的教育。他激动地说：“在旧社会，劳动人民连米糠麸皮都吃不上！我们不要小看这只是吃了几粒剩饭，而是反映了解放军艰苦朴素的光荣传统！”
    过去有些师生由于受修正主义教育路线的毒害，轻视工农、轻视劳动，有的人在坏人的挑动下，随便损坏浪费国家财物。来到这个学校的张殿周、周云贵和其他解放军战士，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚的无产阶级感情，牢记毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，到校后第一件事就是帮助学校布置革命化环境，第一课就是向工人阶级学习，积极配合工人宣传队，开办“抗大”式的毛泽东思想学习班，和师生一起学习毛主席的最新指示，帮助革命师生提高政治觉悟。他们把工人宣传队艰苦朴素，勤俭节约，一心为公的高贵品质，看作是对自己对师生的最好教育，每天提前起床给学校扫地、抹桌、擦窗，帮助伙房洗碗，处处找事干，一边劳动，一边和师生员工谈心。有的学生激动地说：“解放军和我们心连心，有了工人宣传队和解放军，学校的教育革命一定能搞好！”
    小张的行动，引起了很大震动。许多工人同志把这件事带到了工厂进行宣传。在学校“抗大”式毛泽东思想学习班里，师生们热烈地展开讨论，出黑板报。许多师生自觉地进行对照检查，斗私批修。他们说：“过去中国赫鲁晓夫及其在学校的代理人，用资产阶级思想腐蚀毒害我们，使我们脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离劳动，思想感情同工农兵格格不入。今天，毛主席派来了工人宣传队和解放军来领导我们，我们一定不辜负毛主席的期望，坚决在工人阶级的领导下，把学校的斗、批、改搞好，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！”有的教师说：“工农兵的思想最高尚！我们一定要老老实实接受工农兵的再教育！”在工人宣传队和解放军战士的影响下，学校里出现了艰苦朴素的新风气。广大革命师生把培养艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的好作风，看作是向工人阶级、向解放军学习的实际行动。
