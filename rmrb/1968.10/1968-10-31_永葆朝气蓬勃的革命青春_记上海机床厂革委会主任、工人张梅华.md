The rays of Mao Zedong Thought have nurtured a new generation. After more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, tens of thousands of outstanding industrial workers have been promoted to leadership positions. Their status has changed, their duties have changed, but the excellent qualities of the working class remain unchanged. Zhang Meihua, a worker by origin and a member of the Communist Party, is one of them.

Zhang Meihua, after taking up leadership duties, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and a deep proletarian sentiment, always remembers Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an official and a common person." He has always maintained the revolutionary spirit of the working class, never separating himself from the masses, never separating himself from labor, and has won the heartfelt love of the workers throughout the factory.

"As much oil stains on the workers, there are as much on Old Zhang."

After becoming a leader of the revolutionary committee, Zhang Meihua often participates in labor, especially in the most critical places. Many old workers in the factory praise him, saying, "As much oil stains on the workers, there are as much on Old Zhang." Last month, a new type of grinding machine that was supposed to surpass world advanced standards encountered problems during the trial run, affecting the production schedule. Upon hearing this, Zhang Meihua immediately went to the site to work, studying and improving the trial run process with the veteran workers. Soon, the precision was achieved, time was saved, and the task was completed.

Zhang Meihua not only insists on participating in production labor himself but also leads the entire standing committee of the factory revolutionary committee to go down and work. One committee member responsible for supporting border work was once too busy with administrative tasks and did not seriously participate in labor; another committee member did not pay enough attention to labor in his mind and was not serious about it. Zhang Meihua promptly addressed these issues, organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's instructions on cadres participating in collective production labor. Zhang Meihua spoke earnestly, "We proletarian revolutionaries must hold power well and use power well. We must never separate ourselves from labor. If we separate ourselves from labor, we will become revisionists!" With his help, some comrades seriously examined their thoughts of looking down on labor and ensured that they went to the workshops they came from to participate in labor. Recently, Chairman Mao issued new instructions on cadres participating in labor. Zhang Meihua, together with other old and new cadres, compared their participation in labor over the past period with Chairman Mao's new instructions. The factory revolutionary committee also decided that each committee member should go to the workshops to work for three days a week.

Through participating in labor, Zhang Meihua better connected with the masses and understood their thoughts. In the process of participating in labor, he also paid great attention to doing detailed ideological and political work.

"Old Zhang, even after becoming the top leader, is still like us workers."

Zhang Meihua's home is only about ten minutes away from the factory, but he stays in the factory every day to have more conversations with the night shift workers. Usually, it is difficult to find him in the office. Like in the past, he carries a bulging bag containing Chairman Mao's works and other study materials, walking from one workshop to another, studying, working, and fighting with the masses. The workers say, "Old Zhang, even after becoming the top leader, is still like us workers."

This year, before National Day, the factory selected worker representatives to go to Beijing to attend the celebration. All revolutionary employees in the factory were overjoyed and said, "Old Zhang best represents us workers; he is the most qualified to go." After discussion, the revolutionary committee also decided to nominate Zhang Meihua. Zhang Meihua was very excited. The image of the great leader Chairman Mao appeared before him again, and he yearned to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao! What could be more happy than seeing the great leader Chairman Mao! But he thought of the revolutionary employees in the factory who also longed to see Chairman Mao, and immediately suggested, "It is better to select outstanding workers who have not seen Chairman Mao to go." Zhang Meihua's style of letting go of honor made the members of the revolutionary committee deeply moved. According to his suggestion, three other outstanding workers were finally selected to go to Beijing to attend the celebration.

Recently, the revolutionary committee of the First Bureau of Machinery and Electronics donated three pocket-sized, hardcover bound volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to the factory. After serious discussion, the revolutionary committee decided to give one to Zhang Meihua. However, Zhang Meihua said, "Although I need such a treasure very much, the foremen in the workshops need it more. It is better to give it to the best class in terms of carrying out the revolution and promoting production first!" A few words made the other committee members deeply moved. Everyone immediately beat drums and gongs, distributing the treasure to the three best classes in the factory in terms of carrying out the revolution and promoting production. Always be on guard against special privileges, be frugal and remember one's roots.

In the factory, stories about Zhang Meihua not riding in a small car are everywhere. The incident happened in February this year. Zhang Meihua was honored to participate in the Third Session of the Shanghai Garrison Command's Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought. This was a big event for the entire factory. On the day of departure, the factory prepared a small car to send him off, but the driver couldn't find him. It turned out that he had already gone to the reporting place early, carrying his luggage on his back and taking the bus! On the closing day, the revolutionary committee and the driver agreed to pick him up in a grand manner this time. The car arrived at the representative's residence, but Zhang Meihua had already returned to the factory by bus. When they returned to the factory, Zhang Meihua was already in the workshop.

Zhang Meihua always remembers Chairman Mao's teachings, giving enjoyment to others, taking the heaviest burdens, enduring hardships before others, and enjoying after others. His family of five lives in a cramped, dilapidated house. His wife wanted to move to a better house, but Zhang Meihua criticized her, saying, "We already have a house to live in, which is good enough. Many employees need houses more than we do, and we cannot ask for more!" This incident was known to a young worker who had visited Zhang Meihua's home. He reported it to the revolutionary committee. Some people in the factory knew about it and advised him to move to a new house, but he insisted on not moving, saying, "My house can be repaired. We, as leaders, must especially pay attention to not being special in our lives."

"Sleep can be skipped, but studying Chairman Mao's works cannot be skipped."

Every day, no matter how busy Zhang Meihua is with work, he always insists on studying Chairman Mao's works. One day, he worked until two in the morning and then took out "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from his bag to study. Someone said to him, "You still have to go to work tomorrow, go to sleep early." He replied, "Sleep can be skipped, but studying Chairman Mao's works cannot be skipped." He not only studies Chairman Mao's works diligently but also promptly propagates and implements Chairman Mao's series of new instructions, becoming a model for the revolutionary masses in the entire factory to learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought. On August 15th this year, the great leader Chairman Mao issued new instructions: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work must be fully brought into play. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." On the same day, Zhang Meihua and other members of the revolutionary committee finished a meeting and returned to the collective dormitory at midnight. Suddenly, a worker excitedly ran in, telling Zhang Meihua the good news of Chairman Mao's new instructions. Upon hearing the news, he was full of energy. At that moment, the night shift workers were just getting off work. He quickly picked up a loudspeaker and ran to the factory gate, propagating Chairman Mao's new instructions to the night shift workers. After sending off the night shift workers, he immediately organized the revolutionary committee members who were in the factory to study. He excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's instructions are right to the point. We must always listen to Chairman Mao's words and always act according to Chairman Mao's instructions!"

    永葆朝气蓬勃的革命青春
    ——记上海机床厂革委会主任、工人张梅华
    毛泽东思想的阳光雨露，哺育着一代新人。经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，成千成万的优秀产业工人被提拔到了领导岗位上。他们的地位变了，职务变了，但是工人阶级的优秀品质却始终没有变。上海机床厂革命委员会负责人、工人出身的共产党员张梅华，就是其中的一个。
    张梅华担任领导工作以后，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，时刻牢记毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，始终保持着工人阶级的革命本色，不脱离群众，不脱离劳动，受到全厂广大工人群众的衷心爱戴。
    “工人身上有多少油污，老张身上也有多少油污”
    张梅华当了革委会负责人以后，经常参加劳动，而且总是到最关键的地方去劳动。厂里许多老工人赞扬他说：“工人身上有多少油污，老张身上也有多少油污。”上个月，有一台赶超世界先进水平的新品种磨床在试磨过程中出现了问题，影响了生产进度。张梅华知道后，立即到那里去劳动，同老师傅一起研究改进试磨工艺，很快达到了精度，又节省了时间，保证了任务的完成。
    张梅华不但自己坚持参加生产劳动，而且还带动厂革委会的全体常委都下去劳动。有位负责支援边疆工作的常委，一度忙于事务，没有认真参加劳动；还有的常委在思想上对劳动重视不够，劳动起来不踏实。张梅华及时抓住这些苗子，组织大家学习毛主席关于干部参加集体生产劳动的指示。张梅华语重心长地说：“我们无产阶级革命派要掌好权，用好权，就要永远不脱离劳动，脱离了劳动，就要变修！”在他的帮助下，一些同志认真检查了自己轻视劳动的思想，做到从那个车间来的，就到那个车间去参加劳动。最近，毛主席发出关于干部参加劳动的最新指示，张梅华又同其他新老干部对照毛主席的最新指示，检查了前一阶段参加劳动的情况，并且由厂革委会作出决定，每个常委每星期要下车间劳动三天。
    张梅华通过参加劳动，更好地联系了群众，了解了群众的思想动向。他在参加劳动中，还很注意做深入细致的思想政治工作。
    “老张当上了第一把手，还和我们工人一样”
    张梅华的家离厂只有十多分钟的路，可是他却每天住在厂里，为的是多跟夜班同志谈心。在平时，办公室里很难找到他。他象过去一样，提着一个鼓鼓的书包，里面装着毛主席的宝书和其它学习文件，从这个车间走到那个车间，同群众一起学习，一起劳动，一起战斗。工人们说：“老张当上了第一把手，还和我们工人一样。”
    今年国庆前，厂里选派工人代表去北京参加国庆观礼，全厂革命职工个个欢欣鼓舞，都说：“老张最能代表我们工人，他最有资格去。”厂革委会经过讨论，也决定推选张梅华去。张梅华很激动。伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象又浮现在他面前，他多么渴望再去北京看望毛主席啊！还有什么能比看到伟大领袖毛主席更幸福的！可是他想到全厂革命职工也都万分渴望看到毛主席，便马上建议说：“还是应该挑选没有见到过毛主席的优秀工人去好！”张梅华见荣誉就让的风格，使厂革委会的同志深受感动。根据他的建议，最后推选了另外三名优秀工人到北京去观礼。
    最近，机电一局革委会赠送给厂里三部袖珍精装《毛泽东选集》合订本，厂革委会经过认真讨论，决定送给张梅华一部。但是张梅华却说：“我虽然非常需要这样一部宝书，但是车间的老师傅比我更需要，还是先发给抓革命、促生产搞得最好的班组吧！”短短几句话，使其他革委会常委很受感动。大家立即敲锣打鼓，把宝书分送到厂里三个抓革命、促生产最好的班组。时刻严防特殊化，艰苦朴素不忘本
    在厂里，到处流传着张梅华不乘小汽车的故事。事情发生在今年二月。张梅华光荣地参加了中国人民解放军上海警备区第三届活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会。这是全厂的一件大喜事。临走那一天，厂里准备用小汽车送他去，可是司机却怎么也找不到他。原来，他老早就背着行李乘公共汽车去报到了！闭幕的那一天，厂革委会和司机同志商量好，这次可要隆重地把他接回来。车子开到代表驻地，张梅华又已经乘公共汽车回厂了。当他们回到厂里时，张梅华已经在车间了。
    张梅华始终牢记毛主席的教导，把享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。他一家五口人，住的房子很挤，又年久失修了。他爱人想调换一间较好的房子，张梅华听了以后批评道：“咱们有这样的房子住已经不错了，有不少职工比我们更需要房子，我们不能向上伸手！”这件事被曾经到张梅华家去玩的一个青年工人知道了，他向厂革委会作了反映。厂里有些同志知道后也劝他换间新的，可他坚持不肯搬，他说：“我住的房子修理修理就行了。咱们当了头头，特别要注意不能在生活上特殊化。”
    “觉不睡可以，不学毛主席著作不行”
    张梅华每天不管工作多忙，总要坚持学习毛主席著作。一天，他工作到深夜两点了，还从书包里拿出《毛泽东选集》学习。别人对他说：“明天还要上班，早点睡吧。”他回答说：“觉不睡可以，不学毛主席著作不行。”他不但刻苦学习毛主席著作，而且雷厉风行地宣传和落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，成了全厂革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想的好榜样。今年八月十五日，伟大领袖毛主席关于“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的最新指示发表了。当天，张梅华和厂革委会其他委员开完了会，回到集体宿舍已经深夜十二点多钟。突然一位工人兴冲冲地跑来，把毛主席发出最新指示的喜讯告诉了张梅华。他一听见喜讯，浑身是劲。这时，正巧夜班工人下班。他急忙提起喇叭筒，跑到厂区门口，向夜班工人宣传毛主席的最新指示。等他送走夜班工人以后，又立即组织在厂的革委会委员学习。他激动地说：“毛主席的指示，字字句句说到我们心坎上。我们一定要永远听毛主席的话，永远照毛主席的指示办事！”
