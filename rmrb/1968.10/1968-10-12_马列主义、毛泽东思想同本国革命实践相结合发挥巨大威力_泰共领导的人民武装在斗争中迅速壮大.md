The radio station "Voice of the Thai People" recently published an article stating that the rapid development and growth of the Thai people's armed forces are due to the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand and the adherence to the revolutionary line of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong. The Thai people have seriously studied and flexibly applied Mao Zedong's strategies and tactics for people's war.

The article states: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the people's armed forces have responded to the Party's call to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. They have learned, mastered, and applied Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon to solve various problems in the revolution. In particular, they have learned, mastered, and flexibly applied Mao Zedong's military theories on guerrilla warfare. Strategically, they despise the enemy, treating them as paper tigers, but tactically, they do not underestimate the enemy. Therefore, although the people's armed forces are temporarily in an inferior position overall, in each specific battle, they concentrate superior forces to strike the enemy, defeat the enemy, and annihilate the enemy one by one, causing the enemy to suffer defeats everywhere and exposing their true nature as paper tigers. The article points out: For example, from March to July this year, the U.S.-Thanom group concentrated fifteen battalions of police equipped with modern weapons to brutally suppress the people's armed forces and people in Sakhon Nakhon, Kalasin, and Nakhon Phanom. However, their suppression was defeated by the daring and victorious Thai people's armed forces and people who applied Mao Zedong's strategies and tactics for people's war. The people's armed forces killed about 150 enemy soldiers and shot down two enemy planes.

The article states: By mastering Chairman Mao's teachings on the strategy and tactics of people's war: "You fight your way, I fight mine; if you can win, fight; if you can't win, retreat," "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy halts, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue," the Thai people's armed forces fight flexibly and mobilely against the enemy, striking the enemy actively everywhere. They only fight when they are confident of winning and concentrate absolutely superior forces to quickly annihilate the enemy when prepared. For example, last year, the people's armed forces in Khao Wua Ri District, Phetchabun Province, used concentrated superior forces and advantageous terrain to set up an ambush. As soon as the enemy entered the encirclement, they were completely annihilated, and then the people's armed forces quickly withdrew. The people's armed forces have repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on the enemy in this way. The people's armed forces and people in Chiang Rai Province also used Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics for people's war to heavily strike the enemy.

The article states: The soldiers of the people's armed forces, led by the Communist Party of Thailand and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are the bravest, fearing neither hardship nor death. They deeply hate the enemy, love the people, and serve the people wholeheartedly. In the struggle, the soldiers of the people's armed forces have created many miracles. For example, in the famous battle of Lang Suan to break the siege, a small detachment of the people's armed forces, consisting of only thirteen soldiers, was surrounded by the enemy on all sides. They displayed heroic spirit, broke through the enemy's encirclement, and killed eighty-seven enemy soldiers. In a battle in Nan Province, a soldier of the people's armed forces was surrounded by the enemy on all sides, but he fearlessly utilized the terrain to safely break through the enemy's encirclement and killed ten enemy soldiers.

The article states: The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, teaches: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses." He also teaches: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can war be waged." By following Chairman Mao's teachings, the Thai people's armed forces divide their forces to conduct propaganda, actively mobilize and organize the peasant masses, raise the political consciousness of the broad masses, and make them wholeheartedly participate in and support the armed struggle. The broad masses who wholeheartedly support the people's armed forces are truly an iron wall. No enemy can defeat them, and they can defeat all enemies.

The article emphasizes: The victories achieved by the Thai people in the armed struggle are all victories of combining Mao Zedong Thought with Thai revolutionary practice. The article points out: On September 10, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand issued a call for the publication of the first to fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Thai, calling on Party members, soldiers of the people's armed forces, and revolutionary people to carry out the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works more broadly and deeply, thoroughly transforming their worldview, and using the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought standpoint, viewpoint, and method to work seriously and solve various problems. They should focus on studying Chairman Mao's military works and let the brilliant light of great Mao Zedong Thought shine over the land of Thailand. The article expresses firm belief that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the Thai revolution will surely achieve final victory.

    马列主义、毛泽东思想同本国革命实践相结合发挥巨大威力
    泰共领导的人民武装在斗争中迅速壮大
    新华社讯　“泰国人民之声”电台最近发表文章指出：泰国人民武装能够迅速地发展壮大，是由于泰国人民武装斗争是在泰国共产党的领导下进行的，是由于泰国人民在斗争中遵循了世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的革命路线，认真学习和灵活运用毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术。
    文章说：泰国共产党领导下的人民武装认真响应泰国共产党的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学习、掌握并运用毛泽东思想这个强大的武器去解决革命当中的各种问题。特别是学习掌握和灵活运用了毛主席关于游击战争的军事理论，在战略上藐视敌人，把敌人当作纸老虎，但在战术上不轻视敌人。因此，尽管在全局上，人民武装暂时处于劣势地位，但在每一次具体的战斗中，人民武装集中了优势兵力打击敌人，战胜敌人，各个歼灭敌人，使敌人处处遭到失败，从而暴露其纸老虎的本质。文章指出：例如在今年三月至七月间，美国—他侬集团集中用现代化武器装备起来的军警共十五个营，疯狂镇压沙功那空、加拉信、那空拍侬府的人民武装和人民。但他们的镇压却被敢于斗争敢于胜利的泰国人民武装和人民运用毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术所打败。人民武装消灭敌人约一百五十名，击毁敌机两架。
    文章说：由于掌握了毛主席教导的人民战争战略战术：“你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走”，“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”，泰国人民武装灵活机动地和敌人战斗，处处主动打击敌人。每一次战斗有信心打赢才打，并集中了绝对优势兵力，有准备地迅速地消灭敌人。如去年巴蜀府圭武里县的人民武装采用集中优势兵力和有利的地形进行伏击，敌人一进入包围圈就全部加以歼灭，然后迅速转移。人民武装曾这样连续多次给敌人以沉重的打击。清莱府的人民武装和人民也运用了毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术，沉重地打击敌人。
    文章说：泰国共产党领导下的、以毛泽东思想为武器的人民武装战士最勇敢，不怕苦，不怕死。他们极端仇恨敌人，热爱人民，全心全意为人民服务。在斗争中，人民武装战士创造了许多奇迹。如在著名的廊希南的反包围战斗中，人民武装的一个小分队只有十三个战士，被敌人四面包围，他们发挥了英勇的气概冲出敌人的包围圈，消灭敌人八十七名。在难府的一次战斗中，一个人民战士四面被敌人包围，但他毫不畏惧，利用地形，安全地冲出敌人的包围圈，消灭敌人十名。
    文章说：世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”他还教导说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”由于遵循毛主席的这些教导，泰国人民武装分兵以进行宣传，积极动员和组织农民群众，提高广大群众的政治觉悟，使他们全心全意参加和支持武装斗争。全心全意支持人民武装的广大人民群众是真正的铜墙铁壁。什么敌人也打不败他们，而他们能够打败一切敌人。
    文章强调指出：泰国人民在武装斗争中取得的胜利，都是毛泽东思想与泰国革命实践相结合的胜利。文章指出：泰国共产党中央委员会九月十日为泰文《毛泽东选集》第一卷至第四卷出版发表号召书，号召泰共党员、人民武装战士和革命人民更广泛深入地开展活学活用毛主席著作的运动，彻底改造自己的世界观，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法去认真地工作和切实地解决各种问题，专心学习毛主席关于军事的著作，让伟大的毛泽东思想光辉普照泰国大地。文章表示坚决相信，在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的泰国共产党的领导下，泰国革命一定能够取得最后胜利。
