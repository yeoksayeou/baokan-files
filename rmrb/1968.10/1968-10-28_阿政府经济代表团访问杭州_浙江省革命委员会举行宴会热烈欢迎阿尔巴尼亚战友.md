In his speech, Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Xiong Yingtan, enthusiastically praised the heroic Albanian people for their great achievements under the wise leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist, Enver Hoxha, in their struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and in their deepening of the revolutionary movement and the construction of a socialist homeland. Xiong Yingtan highly praised Albania's revolutionary action of withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact controlled by the Soviet revisionist traitors. He said, under the leadership of our great leader Mao Zedong and the great leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, the unbreakable friendship between our two parties and peoples has reached a new height. No matter what happens in the world, we will stand together with the Albanian people, fight together, and win together, to struggle to the end to bury the common enemy of the world's people, American imperialism, and the Soviet revisionist traitors!

In his speech, Albanian Minister of Industry and Mines, Koco Theodhori, enthusiastically praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is of great significance. It ensures that China remains forever red, and it makes the people of the world regard the People's Republic of China as an impregnable fortress, with the banner of socialism and Marxism-Leninism forever flying proudly over China.

Theodhori introduced the new victories achieved by the Albanian people under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour, headed by the great Marxist-Leninist, Enver Hoxha, in building socialism with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun, strengthening national defense, and deepening the revolutionization of all aspects of national life. He said, the friendship between our people and the great Chinese people is an everlasting friendship. The Albanian people cherish this friendship as they cherish their own eyes.

Leaders from the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Hangzhou City Revolutionary Committee, and the stationed troops in Zhejiang, including Lai Keke, Bai Zongshan, Wang Zida, Wan Zhenxi, and Li Qiang, attended the banquet. During their stay in Hangzhou, the Albanian comrades visited factories and toured West Lake, receiving warm welcomes from revolutionary masses wherever they went.
