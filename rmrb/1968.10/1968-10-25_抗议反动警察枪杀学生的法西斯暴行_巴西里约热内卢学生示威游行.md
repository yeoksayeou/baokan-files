About three thousand students in Rio de Janeiro defied the brutal suppression by the police and held a demonstration march on the 23rd to strongly protest the fascist atrocity committed by the reactionary police of Brazil who shot and killed a student on the 22nd.

On the 22nd, approximately one thousand students held a demonstration march in the Vila Isabel district in the northern suburbs of Rio de Janeiro to protest the arrest of representatives who had recently participated in the National Student Congress in São Paulo by the pro-American dictatorship in Brazil. The reactionary authorities immediately dispatched police and "riot control squads" to suppress the demonstrating students, killing one student and injuring several others.

However, the students were undaunted and continued their struggle.

Students at the University of São Paulo also went on strike on the 22nd to protest the savage crimes committed by the pro-American dictatorship in Brazil of arresting student representatives.

Prior to this, there had been continuous mass protests in major cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasília, Recife, Salvador, and Fortaleza against the fascist atrocities of the pro-American dictatorship in Brazil.
