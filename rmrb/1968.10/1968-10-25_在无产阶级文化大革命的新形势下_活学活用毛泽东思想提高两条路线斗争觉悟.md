The editorial board of the *People's Liberation Army Daily* writes: We recommend to all comrades in the military the good experience of the Red Ninth Company in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought.

This experience, summarized in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is a new development in the Red Ninth Company's several years of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought. It is an important achievement in implementing Vice Chairman Lin Biao's directive to raise the study of Chairman Mao Zedong's works to a new level.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the entire Party to wage great political struggles."

Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the struggle between the two classes and the two lines is prominently manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Raising the awareness of cadres and soldiers in the struggle between the two lines has become the primary issue in promoting the ideological revolutionization of the troops, and the primary issue that ideological education work in the troops must address.

The experience of the Red Ninth Company emphasizes the importance of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest directives in the context of the struggle between the two lines. It arms the cadres and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought on the theory, line, policies, and principles of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. It concretely implements Chairman Mao's great directive to "criticize revisionism and fight selfishness," combining the struggle against selfishness with the struggle against revisionism, and combining small rectification with great criticism. In the struggle against revisionism, it continuously transforms worldviews and raises awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. This experience has universal significance for all units.

Through the practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, various units in the military must have many new experiences to summarize and many new problems to solve in actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. We hope that leading cadres and leading organs at all levels will do a good job in investigation and research, grasp typical examples, strengthen leadership, and continuously advance the mass movement of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the troops. We also hope to see more experiences or typical investigation materials like those of the Red Ninth Company.

The key to raising the study of Chairman Mao Zedong's works to a new level lies in focusing on raising awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the course of the movement, there are new things ahead. New things are endless. Studying the overall development of this movement and its development is a major topic that we must always pay attention to."

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution: "The entire Party and the nation are in a new situation of studying Chairman Mao's works. Our army should raise the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level, create a new situation, and adapt to the new situation of the Cultural Revolution."

In February 1967, all comrades in our company responded to Chairman Mao's great call and went to the front lines of "three supports and two militarizations." The new situation of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship presented us with many new problems. These problems were originally reflections of the struggle between the two lines in the minds of cadres and soldiers, but we thought that line issues were matters for higher levels, and we were at the lower levels doing specific work, so we did not talk about line issues. We often treated issues that should be distinguished between the two lines as general issues of ideology and work style. This affected the ideological awakening of cadres and soldiers, causing some comrades to make mistakes in the "three supports and two militarizations" work. Some comrades, after making mistakes, said in frustration: "I subjectively wanted to follow Chairman Mao, but why did my actions not follow, and I could not well execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line?" The soldiers' reflections deeply moved us. We brought this problem to a serious study of Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and realized that the various problems posed by the actual class struggle, the complex situations encountered in the "three supports and two militarizations" work, ultimately boil down to the question of which side to stand on and which line to execute. If we do not strive to raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines, we will not be able to see the direction, distinguish right from wrong, and not only will we not be able to well execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, but we may even unconsciously stand on the side of the wrong line. Striving to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on raising awareness of the struggle between the two lines, is a need for the deepening development of class struggle under proletarian dictatorship, and it is the primary issue in promoting the ideological revolutionization of the troops.

After clarifying that we need to raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines, some comrades thought that the issues in the "three supports and two militarizations" could be linked to the struggle between the two lines, but the real issues within the unit could not be. Practice has proven that this view is also incorrect. For a period, the company appeared to have loose organizational discipline. Initially, we thought these problems were caused by the dispersion of the troops and had nothing to do with the struggle between the two lines, so we conducted criticism and education within the company, but the results were not significant. Later, we used class analysis to seriously study the problems in the company and found that the loose organizational discipline was actually influenced by the anarchist trend in society. We started from helping everyone recognize the harm of anarchist ideology to the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, raised organizational discipline to the height of the struggle between the two lines, and effectively overcame the phenomenon of loose organizational discipline. This made us further realize that "a breeze in society, a wave in the mind." Not only are the issues that arise in the "three supports and two militarizations" work reflections of the struggle between the two lines, but other real ideological issues, such as joining the Party or the Youth League, future prospects, and status, are also influenced by the struggle between the two lines.

In ideological education work, there have always been two lines: one is the revolutionary line advocated by Chairman Mao, which closely links ideological education to the actual class struggle and serves proletarian dictatorship; the other is the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev, which separates from the actual class struggle and advocates "cultivation" behind closed doors. If we talk about ideological transformation without linking it to the struggle between the two lines, we will lead the troops down the wrong path of separating from proletarian politics, and there is the danger of falling into the trap of "cultivation" behind closed doors.

Through repeated practice, we gradually unified our understanding and explored some ways to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought and raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines in the new situation of class struggle. This is: using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, with "criticize revisionism and fight selfishness" as the main task, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, combining the struggle against selfishness with the struggle against revisionism, combining small rectification with great criticism, continuously transforming worldviews, and raising awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Over the past year, the awareness of cadres and soldiers in the struggle between the two lines has significantly improved, they have been tempered in the storms of class struggle, and the company's revolutionary construction has presented a new appearance.

Finding problems from the struggle between the two lines and drawing clear lines between the two lines in revolutionary criticism

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not forget to draw these two lines when looking at problems: the line between revolution and counter-revolution, and the line between achievements and shortcomings. First of all, is it revolution or counter-revolution? Is it Yan'an or Xi'an?"

Finding problems from the struggle between the two lines is much more difficult than grasping the daily work and life issues. The lines between right and wrong in daily work and life issues are relatively clear and easier to grasp. The lines between right and wrong in the struggle between the two lines are not entirely the same. Because a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, when pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, always wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, confusing the lines between revolution and counter-revolution, deliberately mixing up the two lines. Especially during the Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two lines was extremely sharp and complex, with different manifestations in different periods, and the situation changed rapidly. Thus, sometimes cadres and soldiers found it difficult to distinguish right from wrong, even mistaking the wrong for the right. Therefore, we treated the process of guiding cadres and soldiers to find problems from the struggle between the two lines as the process of helping everyone draw clear lines between the two lines. The specific method is: closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, timely using Chairman Mao's latest directives to analyze the ideological reality of the troops, and understand the main issues that need to be addressed in the troops' ideology. For a period, cadres and soldiers had more discussions about their views on mass organizations, with some comrades in their work favoring one faction and alienating another, thinking this was "drawing clear lines," while others disagreed. Which view was in line with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line? At this time, Chairman Mao issued the latest directive to "firmly believe that the majority of the masses are good, and that bad people are a small minority." We compared this with Chairman Mao's latest directive and saw that favoring one faction and alienating another was not a correct attitude towards the masses, so we decided to make this issue a key point in helping cadres and soldiers draw clear lines between the two lines. Chairman Mao's latest directive is the highest standard for us to judge right from wrong. When we implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, we often conduct self-examinations to see if we have followed it, where the gaps are, and what the reasons are. In this way, we have timely found the main problems we have in the struggle between the two lines.

After clarifying the issues to be addressed, we organized cadres and soldiers to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism. This is the fundamental way to draw clear lines between the two lines. Over the past year, we have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and frequently carried out revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's various counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, making everyone's understanding of the lines between the two lines increasingly clear. Squad leader Qiu Guoan supported a revolutionary mass organization in a workshop and suppressed another revolutionary mass organization. The members of this organization came to talk to him, but he did not, and he also told his squadmates: "Supporting the left must be clear-cut, and we cannot let them 'pick up straw.'" Later, the company organized everyone to criticize the crimes of the capitalist road of repression of the masses, making him realize that supporting or suppressing revolutionary masses is the fundamental difference between the two lines in the Cultural Revolution, thus establishing a correct attitude towards the masses and uniting with the broad revolutionary masses. In the revolutionary criticism, we especially paid attention to linking the counter-revolutionary fallacies of the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party with the reactionary views spread by the class enemies in the local area at that time, making the understanding of the capitalist road of reaction more specific and profound.

On the basis of drawing clear lines between the two lines, we led by the situation, inspiring cadres and soldiers to reflect on their performance in the struggle between the two lines, seeing which were achievements and progress made under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and which were shortcomings and errors influenced by the capitalist road of reaction, consciously carrying out "ideological alignment." In this way, everyone clearly saw the problems they had in the struggle between the two lines, raising their understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Finding the cause from the worldview and recognizing the harm of the bourgeois "self" from the height of the struggle between the two lines

Initially, we felt that cadres and soldiers were subjectively active in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and even if there were some shortcomings and errors in the struggle between the two lines, they were issues of awareness and did not pay attention to finding the cause from the worldview after finding problems in the struggle between the two lines, guiding everyone to break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness. In this way, some problems were solved, but they kept recurring. On this issue, we became clear that in another problem, we became confused again. Sometimes, problems that had already been solved became confused again because of the "self" acting up. Deputy squad leader Wang Defu had such a situation. Once, a factional organization wanted to have cadres "show their faces" in their organization, and Wang Defu felt that this did not conform to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and wanted both factions to release the cadres. This organization said he was deliberately sabotaging and even said they would report to the company. Wang Defu was afraid of losing face in front of the company and did not dare to insist on principles, saying: "You decide, I have not thought it through." Later, he studied Chairman Mao's works and fought against the "self," and actively propagated Chairman Mao's latest directives to the masses, mobilizing them to unite and release the cadres, finally breaking through their thoughts. He deeply felt: "Giving in to the 'self' even a little, you cannot stand firm on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; only by fighting against the 'self' without yielding an inch, can you follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line without yielding an inch." Wang Defu's experience was very enlightening to us. We re-studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview." We realized that executing which line is essentially using which worldview to transform the world. The proletarian worldview is the ideological foundation for executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the bourgeois worldview is the ideological root for accepting and executing the wrong line. Therefore, only by thoroughly transforming the worldview can we fundamentally raise awareness of the struggle between the two lines and consciously execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Later, we paid attention to guiding everyone to look at their worldview from the problems they had in the struggle between the two lines, finding the "self" that hindered the execution of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, organizing cadres and soldiers to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, discussing the harm of the "self" from the height of the struggle between the two lines, and digging up the roots of the "self." Squad leader Quan Jingtian had the idea of wanting to show off in the past, but he did not deeply understand the harm of the "self" and had not solved it well. After participating in the "supporting the left," he was eager to show off, did not seriously investigate and study, and once affected the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives in this workshop. Later, he looked at this problem from the height of the struggle between the two lines, and his understanding became profound. He said: "It was precisely this desire to show off that interfered with my correct execution of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The 'self' must be broken, or it will be disastrous." He further dug up the root of his thoughts and found that he was poisoned by China's Khrushchev's "theory of the fusion of public and private." The soldiers raised the harm of the "self" to the height of the struggle between the two lines, concentrating their hatred on China's Khrushchev, hating the "self" deeply, and fighting against the "self" deeply, being able to thoroughly break down the "self" and establish public-mindedness.

Actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest directives, arming the mind with Mao Zedong Thought on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship

Every latest directive from Chairman Mao is aimed at problems in class struggle, and the problems in the minds of cadres and soldiers are ultimately reflections of actual class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao's latest directives are powerful ideological weapons for guiding the struggle between the two lines and are also powerful ideological weapons for guiding the ideological revolutionization of the troops. Actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest directives, arming the minds of cadres and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought on the theory, line, policies, and principles of continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, is the fundamental way to promote the ideological revolutionization of the troops.

Practice has proven that many difficult-to-solve problems can be solved as long as Chairman Mao's latest directives are seriously learned and applied. New soldier Wang Baoyu is a young intellectual. In a workshop supporting the left, he always thought he knew more than the workers and did not pay attention to humbly listening to the opinions of the worker masses in cleaning up the class ranks, making the work progress slowly and not knowing the cause. After Chairman Mao issued the latest directive to "fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," we organized the entire company to study it seriously. Wang Baoyu found the answer through study, realizing that the previous work was not done well mainly because he neglected the leading role of the working class. He firmly implemented Chairman Mao's latest directive, cleared away the influence of the revisionist educational line on himself, overcame the erroneous idea of looking down on workers and peasants. He humbly learned from the working class, accepted the re-education of the working class, and finally, together with the worker masses, exposed the hidden counter-revolutionaries in the workshop. Wang Baoyu's ideological revolutionization also advanced a step in the struggle.

In the study, we first organized everyone to use Chairman Mao's latest directives as a weapon to analyze the new situation and new trends of class struggle, understand what Chairman Mao's latest directives advocate and oppose, and deeply understand the essence of Chairman Mao's latest directives. For example, when studying Chairman Mao's latest directives on the essence of the Cultural Revolution, we mobilized cadres and soldiers to connect with what they saw and heard in the struggle to support the left, exposing a lot of enemy situations, and also invited worker comrades to introduce their experiences and feelings in struggling against class enemies. The soldiers deeply realized from a large number of facts that our struggle with a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party is "a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries," and Chairman Mao's latest directives are a great battle order calling on us to actively and unceasingly launch fierce attacks on class enemies and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. After the cadres and soldiers studied, their fighting spirit was greatly inspired, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, they fiercely counterattacked the rightist reversal wind blown by class enemies.

To help cadres and soldiers deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest directives, we sometimes organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest directives in connection with Chairman Mao's consistent thoughts in guiding the revolution. For a period, some comrades could not correctly treat the masses, and we organized the study of Chairman Mao's latest directives on "believing in and relying on the masses" when we organized the study. We found Chairman Mao's statements on uniting the majority of the masses in the first and second domestic revolutionary wars, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the Cultural Revolution, and studied them together, making cadres and soldiers realize that in various historical periods of revolution, although the objects of revolution and the tasks of revolution have changed, believing in and relying on the masses is Chairman Mao's consistent thought. It is precisely this brilliant thought that guides us to achieve one great victory after another, thus correcting everyone's attitude towards the masses who made mistakes. Chairman Mao's series of latest directives in the Cultural Revolution are the application and development of Chairman Mao's consistent thoughts in guiding the revolution over the past few decades. We connect Chairman Mao's consistent thoughts to study Chairman Mao's latest directives, making cadres and soldiers have a more systematic understanding of the history of the struggle between the two lines and deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

We must not establish without destroying. In the process of arming the minds of cadres and soldiers with Chairman Mao's latest directives, we especially paid attention to guiding everyone to actively carry out ideological struggle. Over the past year, we have studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest directives to answer and solve issues such as attitudes towards the masses, the influence of bourgeois factionalism, the influence of anarchist ideology, understanding of the situation of the Cultural Revolution, superior-subordinate relationships, and rightist relaxation sentiments. In this way, in the process of destroying and establishing, we truly mastered Chairman Mao's latest directives, making Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply rooted in the minds of cadres and soldiers. The soldiers said: "Chairman Mao's latest directives come to arm us, we have a direction to advance, we have the strength to struggle, and we will always stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

In the struggle, we continuously summarize experiences and continuously carry out re-learning and re-education of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Practice, cognition, re-practice, re-cognition, this form, cycle after cycle, endlessly, and the content of each cycle of practice and cognition is relatively advanced to a higher level."

Through the practice of the struggle between the two lines, cadres and soldiers have rich sensory knowledge of the struggle between the two lines. We guided everyone to use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and understand their own struggle practice, find experiences and lessons, and continuously carry out re-learning and re-education of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Our practice is: helping soldiers solve one problem in the struggle, conducting one summary; reaching a certain stage, summarizing many problems together, finding regularized cognition from multiple struggle practices, and raising experience to a higher level. The soldiers said: "In the struggle between the two lines, there are many new situations and new problems. Only by summarizing as we go, will we become freer and freer."

Over the past year, in addition to frequently helping soldiers summarize the bit-by-bit experiences of the struggle between the two lines, we have also conducted five comprehensive summaries, raising one level with each summary.

The struggle between the two lines is continuously advancing, and there will be many new things and new problems facing us. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings on "practice, cognition, re-practice, re-cognition," continuously carry out re-learning and re-education of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, strive to raise the awareness of cadres and soldiers in the struggle between the two lines, and bravely fight to execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下  活学活用毛泽东思想提高两条路线斗争觉悟
    “学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”党支部委员会
    《解放军报》编者按：我们向全军同志们推荐红九连活学活用毛泽东思想的又一篇好经验。
    这篇在无产阶级文化大革命新形势下总结出来的经验，是红九连几年来活学活用毛泽东思想的一个新发展，是他们贯彻落实林副主席关于把学习毛主席著作提高到新阶段的指示所取得的一个重要成果。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”
    在无产阶级专政条件下，两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，突出地表现为党内两条路线斗争。提高干部战士的两条路线斗争觉悟，成为搞好部队思想革命化的首要问题，成为部队思想教育工作所要解决的首要问题。
    红九连这篇经验，突出强调了带着两条路线斗争中的问题活学活用毛主席的最新指示，用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策武装干部战士的头脑。它具体贯彻了毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大指示，把斗私和批修结合起来，把小整风和大批判结合起来，在批判修正主义的斗争中不断改造世界观，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。这个经验，对于各部队有着普遍的意义。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，各部队在活学活用毛泽东思想上必定有许多新的经验需要总结，也必定有一些新的问题需要解决。希望各级领导干部、领导机关做好调查研究工作，抓好典型，加强领导，把部队活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断推向前进。并希望能够经常看到象红九连这样的经验或典型调查材料。
    把活学活用毛主席著作提高到新阶段的关键是在提高两条路线斗争觉悟上狠下功夫
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”
    林副主席在文化大革命初期指出：“全党全国学习毛主席著作出现了新的形势，我们军队要把学习毛主席著作提高到新的阶段，搞出新的局面，要适应文化大革命这个新的形势”。
    一九六七年二月，我们全连同志响应毛主席的伟大号召，走上了“三支”“两军”第一线。无产阶级专政下继续革命的新形势给我们提出了许多新问题。这些问题本来是两条路线斗争在干部战士思想上的反映，可是我们却认为路线问题是上面的事，我们下面是做具体工作的，谈不到路线问题。常常把应该从两条路线上分清是非的问题，当作一般的思想作风、工作方法问题来看待。这样就影响了干部战士思想觉悟的提高，使一些同志在“三支”“两军”工作中办了些错事。有的同志出了错以后，难过地说：“自己主观上想紧跟毛主席，为什么行动上却跟不上，不能很好地执行毛主席的革命路线呢？”战士们的反映，深深地触动了我们。我们带着这个问题认真学习了毛主席的有关教导，认识到，现实阶级斗争给我们提出的各种各样的问题，“三支”“两军”工作中碰到的错综复杂的情况，归根到底都是站在那一边，执行什么路线的问题。如果不努力提高两条路线斗争觉悟，就会看不清方向，分不清是非，不仅不能很好地执行毛主席的革命路线，甚至会自觉不自觉地站到错误路线一边去。努力活学活用毛泽东思想，在提高两条路线斗争觉悟上狠下功夫，这是无产阶级专政下阶级斗争深入发展的需要，是搞好部队思想革命化的首要问题。
    明确了要提高两条路线斗争觉悟以后，有的同志又认为，“三支”“两军”中的问题和两条路线斗争好挂钩，部队内部的一些现实思想和两条路线斗争挂不上。实践证明，这种看法也是不对的。有一个时期，连里出现了组织纪律松弛的现象。开始我们把这些问题看成是由于部队分散造成的，和两条路线斗争挂不上，就在连队进行了批评教育，结果收效不大。后来，我们用阶级分析的方法认真研究了连队出现的问题，发现原来组织纪律松弛，是受了社会上无政府主义思潮的影响。于是，我们从帮助大家认识无政府主义思想对贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的危害入手，把组织纪律观念提到了两条路线斗争的高度，有力地克服了组织纪律松弛的现象。这使我们进一步认识到，“社会上一阵风，头脑里一层浪”。不仅“三支”“两军”工作中出现的问题是两条路线斗争的反映，就是其它一些现实思想问题，例如入党入团、前途地位等问题，也不能不受到两条路线斗争的影响。
    在思想教育工作上，历来存在着两条路线：一条是毛主席一贯提倡的思想教育紧密联系阶级斗争实际，为无产阶级专政服务的革命路线；一条是中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的脱离现实阶级斗争，闭门“修养”的反革命修正主义路线。如果脱离两条路线斗争去谈思想改造，就会把部队引导到脱离无产阶级政治的邪路上去，就有陷入闭门“修养”的危险。
    经过反复实践，逐步统一了认识，并且摸索出一些在阶级斗争新形势下活学活用毛泽东思想、提高两条路线斗争觉悟的做法，这就是：以毛泽东思想为指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲，带着两条路线斗争中的问题，活学活用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，把斗私和批修结合起来，把小整风和革命大批判结合起来，不断改造世界观，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。一年多来，干部战士的两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，经受了阶级斗争大风大浪的锻炼，连队的革命化建设出现了新的面貌。
    从两条路线斗争中找问题，在革命大批判中划清两条路线大是大非的界限
    毛主席教导我们：“我们看问题一定不要忘记划清这两种界限：革命和反革命的界限，成绩和缺点的界限。”“首先，是革命还是反革命？是延安还是西安？”从两条路线斗争中找问题，划清什么是毛主席的革命路线，什么是反革命修正主义路线，这是提高两条路线斗争觉悟的首要问题。
    从两条路线斗争中找问题，比抓日常工作、生活中的活思想要困难得多。日常工作、生活中的问题，公和私、是和非的界限比较清楚，比较容易抓住。两条路线斗争中的问题就不完全是这样。由于党内一小撮走资派在推行反革命修正主义路线时，总是打着“红旗”反红旗，混淆革命和反革命的界限，故意把两条路线搅混。特别是文化大革命中，两条路线斗争极其尖锐复杂，在不同时期，有不同的表现，情况千变万化。这样，有时干部、战士就很难分清那些是是，那些是非，甚至把错误的当成正确的。因此，我们把引导干部战士从两条路线斗争中找问题的过程，作为帮助大家划清两条路线大是大非界限的过程。具体做法是：紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，及时用毛主席最新指示分析部队的思想实际，弄清部队思想上应该着重解决的问题。有一个时期，干部、战士在对群众组织的看法上议论比较多，有的同志在工作中亲一派、疏一派，认为这是“划清了界限”，有的不同意这种看法。究竟那一种看法符合毛主席革命路线呢？这时，毛主席发出了“要坚决相信大多数群众是好的，坏人是极少数”的最新指示，我们用毛主席的最新指示一对照，看出亲一派、疏一派是不能正确对待群众的表现，就决定把这个问题作为帮助干部战士划清两条路线界限的一个重点。毛主席的最新指示，是我们判断是非的最高标准。我们在贯彻毛主席的最新指示时，经常进行对照检查，看我们跟上没有，差距在那里，原因是什么，这样，就及时找出了我们在两条路线斗争中存在的主要问题。
    明确了要解决的问题以后，我们就组织干部战士深入开展革命大批判。这是划清两条路线界限的根本途径。去年以来，我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，经常开展革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的种种反革命修正主义谬论，使大家对两条路线的界限认识越来越清。班长仇国贤在一个车间支左，支持了一个革命群众组织，压制了另一个革命群众组织。这个组织的成员来找他谈心他也不谈，还跟班里的同志说：“支持左派一定要旗帜鲜明，不能叫人家捞了‘稻草’。”后来，连里组织大家批判了资产阶级反动路线镇压群众的罪行，使他认识到对革命群众是支持还是压制，是文化大革命中两条路线的根本区别，从而树立了对待群众的正确态度，团结了广大革命群众。在革命大批判中，我们特别注意把党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命谬论，同本地区阶级敌人在当时所散布的反动观点联系起来批，这样，对资产阶级反动路线的认识就更具体、更深刻了。
    在划清两条路线界限的基础上，我们因势利导，启发干部战士摆自己在两条路线斗争中的表现，看那些是在毛主席革命路线指引下取得的成绩和进步，那些是受资产阶级反动路线的影响造成的缺点和错误，自觉地进行“思想站队”。这样，大家就清楚地看到了自己在两条路线斗争中存在的问题，提高了对毛主席革命路线的认识。
    从世界观上找原因，从两条路线斗争的高度认识资产阶级“私”字的危害
    开始，我们感到干部战士主观上都是积极贯彻毛主席革命路线的，即使在两条路线斗争中出现一些缺点错误，也是认识问题，没有注意到在找到了两条路线斗争中的问题后，进一步引导从世界观上找原因，破私立公。这样，有些问题解决以后，不断出现反复。在这个问题上搞清楚了，在另一个问题上又糊涂起来。有时已经搞清楚了的问题，因为“私”字作怪，遇到一点风浪就发生摇摆。副班长王德富就有过这种情况。有一次，一派组织要拉干部在本组织“亮相”，王德富觉得这样做不符合毛主席革命路线，要两派一起解放干部。这个组织就说他存心拆台，还说要反映给连里。王德富怕闹到连里脸上不光彩，就不敢坚持原则，说：“你们看着办吧，我考虑得不够成熟。”后来，他学习毛主席著作，狠斗了“私”字，并到群众中去积极宣传毛主席的最新指示，动员联合起来解放干部，终于打通了他们的思想。他深有体会地说：“对‘私’字让半步，在毛主席革命路线上就站不住；只有斗私寸步不让，跟毛主席革命路线才能寸步不离。”王德富这个体会，对我们很有启发。我们重新学习了毛主席的教导：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”认识到，执行什么路线，实质上就是用什么样的世界观改造世界。无产阶级世界观是执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线的思想基础，资产阶级世界观是接受和执行错误路线的思想根源。因此，只有彻底改造世界观，才能从根本上提高两条路线斗争觉悟，自觉地执行毛主席的革命路线。
    以后，我们就注意引导大家从自己在两条路线斗争中存在的问题来看自己的世界观，找出妨碍执行毛主席革命路线的“私”字，组织干部战士活学活用毛主席著作，从两条路线斗争的高度上论“私”字的危害，挖“私”字的根源。班长全景田过去有爱表现自己的思想，但对“私”字的危害认识不深，一直没有很好解决。参加支左以后，急于露一手，不认真调查研究，一度影响了毛主席最新指示在这个车间的落实。后来，他从两条路线斗争的高度上来看这个问题，认识就深刻了。他说：“正是这个露一手的思想，干扰了自己正确执行毛主席革命路线，‘私’字不破真不得了。”他进一步挖了思想根子，找到是受中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化论”的毒害。战士们把“私”字的危害提到了两条路线斗争的高度，把仇恨集中到了中国赫鲁晓夫身上，恨私就恨得狠，斗私就斗得深，就能大破“私”字，大立“公”字。
    活学活用毛主席的最新指示，用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论武装头脑
    毛主席的每一条最新指示，都是针对阶级斗争中的问题提出来的，干部战士思想上的问题，归根结底也是现实阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的反映。毛主席的最新指示是指导两条路线斗争的强大思想武器，也是指导部队思想革命化建设的强大思想武器。活学活用毛主席的最新指示，用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策武装干部战士的头脑，这是搞好部队思想革命化的根本。
    事实证明，很多难于解决的问题，只要认真活学活用毛主席的最新指示，就可以得到解决。新战士王宝玉是个知识青年。他在一个车间支左，总以为自己比工人懂得多，在清理阶级队伍中，不注意虚心听取工人群众的意见，工作进展很慢，还不知原因在哪里。毛主席发出“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示后，我们组织全连进行了认真学习。王宝玉通过学习找到了答案，认识到前一段工作没有搞好，主要是忽视了工人阶级的领导作用。他坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，清除了修正主义教育路线对自己的影响，克服了轻视工农的错误思想。他虚心向工人阶级学习，接受工人阶级的再教育，终于和工人群众一起，揪出了车间里暗藏的反革命分子。王宝玉的思想革命化也在斗争中前进了一步。
    在学习中，我们首先组织大家以毛主席的最新指示为武器，分析阶级斗争的新形势、新动向，弄清毛主席最新指示提倡的是什么，反对的是什么，深刻理解毛主席最新指示的精神实质。比如学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命实质的最新指示，我们发动干部战士联系支左斗争中所见所闻，大摆敌情，还请工人同志介绍了他们和阶级敌人斗争的情况和体会。战士们从大量事实中深刻地认识到，我们和党内一小撮走资派的斗争，“是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续”，毛主席的最新指示，是号召我们主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大战斗号令。干部战士学习以后，大大鼓舞了斗志，和广大革命群众一起，狠狠地反击了阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风。
    为了帮助干部战士深刻理解毛主席的最新指示，有时我们还组织大家把毛主席的最新指示和毛主席指导革命的一贯思想联系起来学习。有一个时期，有的同志不能正确地对待群众，我们组织学习毛主席关于“要相信和依靠群众”的最新指示时，把毛主席在第一、二次国内革命战争时期、抗日战争时期、解放战争时期、社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，以及无产阶级文化大革命中关于团结大多数群众的论述找出来，集中在一起学习，使干部战士认识到，在各个革命历史时期，尽管革命的对象、革命的任务有变化，但相信和依靠群众，是毛主席的一贯思想，正是这一光辉思想指引我们取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利，从而端正了大家对犯错误群众的态度。毛主席在文化大革命中的一系列最新指示，是毛主席几十年来指导革命的一贯思想的运用和发展。我们联系毛主席的一贯思想来学习毛主席的最新指示，就使干部战士比较系统地了解了两条路线斗争的历史，加深了对毛主席革命路线的理解。
    不破不立。我们在用毛主席最新指示武装干部战士头脑的过程中，特别注意引导大家积极开展思想斗争。去年以来，我们学习和运用毛主席的最新指示，回答和解决了对待群众的态度、资产阶级派性影响、无政府主义思潮影响、对文化大革命形势的认识、上下级关系、右倾松劲情绪等问题。这样，在大破大立中，把毛主席的最新指示真正学到手，使毛主席的革命路线在干部战士头脑里深深地扎了根。战士们说：
  “毛主席最新指示来武装，前进有方向，斗争有力量，永远站在毛主席革命路线上！”
    在斗争中不断总结经验，不断进行毛主席革命路线的再学习、再教育
    毛主席教导我们：“实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”
    经过两条路线斗争的实践，干部战士对两条路线斗争有了丰富的感性知识。我们就引导大家用毛泽东思想来分析和认识自己的斗争实践，找出经验教训，不断进行毛主席革命路线的再学习、再教育。我们的做法是：帮助战士在斗争中解决一个问题，就进行一次总结；到一定阶段，又把许多问题综合起来进行总结，从多次的斗争实践中找出规律性的认识，把经验上升到一个更高的水平。战士们说：“在两条路线斗争中，有许多新情况、新问题，只有边做边总结，才会越做越自由。”
    去年以来，我们除经常帮助战士总结两条路线斗争中一点一滴的经验外，还进行了五次全面性的总结，总结一次，提高一步。
    两条路线斗争是不断向前发展的，还将有许多新事物、新问题摆在我们面前。我们决心遵循毛主席关于“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的教导，不断进行毛主席革命路线的再学习、再教育，努力提高干部战士的两条路线斗争觉悟，为执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线而英勇战斗！
