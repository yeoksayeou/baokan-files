The Program Village Agricultural Labor School in Jian Tou Commune, Xin Cai County, Henan Province, is a new-type school established and managed by poor and lower-middle peasants in accordance with Chairman Mao's great directive that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." It is an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style school.

Over the past two years, this school has trained a batch of laborers with socialist consciousness and culture for the countryside, blazing a new trail for the rural educational revolution. Currently, twenty communes in Xin Cai County have established Program-style agricultural labor schools.

Opening the Door for the Children of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

The predecessor of the Program Village Agricultural Labor School was a commune-run agricultural middle school. When it was established in the spring of 1964, poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully sent their children to school and allocated seventy mu of good land to the "agricultural middle school" as an experimental field. However, because the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the school had not changed, the "agricultural middle school" implemented the revisionist educational line of Chinese Khrushchev, following the old path of "three separations" (separation from proletarian politics, separation from the workers and peasants, separation from productive practice). As a result, students became lazy, and the experimental field was left fallow. Poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The agricultural middle school is not agricultural, it is detached from the struggle, it closes the door to read books, the more you read, the more you become a revisionist." In March 1966, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Program Brigade, filled with indignation towards the revisionist educational line of Chinese Khrushchev, overthrew the "agricultural middle school" and seized its power. With the support of revolutionary cadres at the county and commune levels, they established the new Program Village Agricultural Labor School.

This school abolished the old system of "one person in charge" and implemented democratic school management. Since the Cultural Revolution, under the leadership of the brigade revolutionary committee, a three-in-one education revolution committee consisting of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary students has been established.

This school opens its doors to the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. All the students in the first batch are children of poor and lower-middle peasants, most of whom are junior high school students, with a few senior high school and primary school students. Students are recommended by the brigade and sent by the commune, coming and going from commune to commune.

This school is taught by poor and lower-middle peasants. All students live in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, eating, living, working, studying, and criticizing together from beginning to end. The eighty-five students in the second batch live in eighty-four households of poor and lower-middle peasants. Poor and lower-middle peasants conduct class education and labor education for the students. Students help poor and lower-middle peasants learn culture and study Chairman Mao's works together. The agricultural technology course is taught by poor and lower-middle peasants with rich practical experience, with three agricultural technicians as assistants. The two former part-time teachers from the "agricultural middle school" study and live with the poor and lower-middle peasants, accepting re-education from them.

This school emphasizes proletarian politics, adheres to the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, and focuses on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The school has five courses: politics, military, culture, technology, and labor. Politics is the main course, reading the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," memorizing "Quotations from Chairman Mao," using the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a motto, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, criticizing and reforming private thoughts, and changing worldviews. Military courses, students participate in activities with the militia, learning the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style of the PLA. Cultural courses, together with the youth in the team, organize reading groups, broadcasting, propaganda, and cultural activities to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Technical courses, learn the cultivation and management techniques of major crops such as cotton, wheat, corn, and sweet potatoes, and basic knowledge of plant protection, agricultural machinery, and electromechanics. Labor courses, in addition to labor training, also learn production management knowledge, grasp the agricultural seasons, and reasonably arrange farm work. The school term is two years. Half a day of study and half a day of labor. They "do not learn first and then do, but do and then learn." From sowing to harvesting, two seasons of cotton, one season of wheat. What to do, what to learn, learning and using together, seeing immediate results.

Visiting this school, you cannot see the school buildings, find the principal, or distinguish between students, teachers, and commune members. What kind of school is this? They replied: "This is a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought. The works of Chairman Mao are our most precious textbooks, poor and lower-middle peasants are our best teachers, and the vast world is our ideal classroom."

A Batch of New People Cultivated by Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

In the autumn of 1967, the Program Village Agricultural Labor School graduated its first batch of fifty-one students. Among these graduates, two were former part-time teachers. They studied under the poor and lower-middle peasants for two years, and the poor and lower-middle peasants have approved them to teach again. Additionally, there was a senior high school student from Anhui who was moved by this new-type school during a visit in 1966 and voluntarily stayed to become a "student." After graduation, he returned to his hometown to become an agricultural technician. The forty-eight graduates from this commune were eagerly recruited by various brigades. Twenty-three were taken by seven communes in ten key brigades, and the twenty-five who remained in the commune were assigned to nine key brigades. Wherever they went, they implemented the "five together" with the local poor and lower-middle peasants and were warmly welcomed by them. Poor and lower-middle peasants praised them as "five-in-one soldiers": propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, guides for studying the works of Chairman Mao, members of the mass work team, production fighters, agricultural technicians, and core militia members.

The students trained by this school have two characteristics: first, they have firm ideals, are loyal to Chairman Mao, are content with rural life, love labor, and have a close bond with poor and lower-middle peasants; second, they have real skills, are proficient in all farm work, and take the lead in everything. Of the forty-eight graduates, two joined the army and were rated as "five-good soldiers," one became a standing committee member and accountant of the brigade revolutionary committee, seventeen were selected as active learners of Chairman Mao's works at the county level, and the rest became active learners of Chairman Mao's works at the commune level.

The students trained by this school are completely different from those trained by old schools. A technical officer who graduated from an agricultural college managed a small wheat experimental field, pretended to know everything, and blindly followed the book. When sowing, he did not listen to the poor and lower-middle peasants and sowed too early, resulting in the wheat sprouting and being killed by frost. A youth who graduated from the Program Village Agricultural Labor School had both practical knowledge and followed the mass line. He managed six mu of wheat experimental field and created a high-yield record of an average of 780 jin per mu.

Nearby Yanglaozhuang Brigade has a full-time middle school. In the past, students from this middle school looked down on the Program Village Agricultural Labor School, saying: "Dealing with the landlord has no future." However, the evaluation of poor and lower-middle peasants was completely opposite, saying that graduates of full-time middle schools "eat well and dress well, and are not useful anywhere." Graduates of labor schools "can speak and do, and are welcomed everywhere."

The educational revolution is changing everything. Over the past two years, Program Brigade has undergone earth-shaking changes. Program and Yanglaozhuang were originally one brigade, but because Yanglaozhuang was rich and Program was poor, they split in 1961. In the early years, Program could not catch up with Yanglaozhuang, but since the establishment of the agricultural labor school, the brigade manages the school, and the school promotes the brigade. The tide of studying and applying the thoughts of Mao Zedong is unprecedentedly high, and everywhere is a battlefield of revolutionary criticism with a strong political atmosphere. In the past, Program Brigade had 450 illiterates and semi-illiterates among the youth, and 274 quickly removed their illiterate hats, learning to read newspapers and write criticism articles. People changed, and the land changed. In these two years, the grain and cotton production of Program far exceeded that of Yanglaozhuang. In the past, Program Brigade needed the state to supply more than ten million jin of grain each year, but in 1967, it sold more than twenty million jin of grain to the state. The cotton yield increased from 48 jin per mu in 1965 to 164 jin per mu.

The Program Village Agricultural Labor School fully demonstrates the powerful vitality of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and the unparalleled superiority of poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools.

Managing Schools by Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants is a Sharp Class Struggle

The growth process of the Program Village Agricultural Labor School has always been permeated with fierce struggles between two classes, two lines, and two roads. The focus of the struggle is on the fundamental issue of who holds the power of rural education and which direction and what kind of people to cultivate.

Managing schools by poor and lower-middle peasants is an unprecedented event. As soon as this school appeared, it was viciously attacked and obstructed in every possible way by a handful of class enemies. A landlord element said, "In a hundred years, I have never seen 'rough people' running a school. A basket of characters is not recognized, and they still want to be saints." A handful of capitalist roaders within the old county committee said, "This school recites the works of Mao all day and circles around the fields, it's simply nonsense!" When holding a teachers' meeting, they did not allow the teachers of this school to participate, and when allocating educational funds, there was no share for this school, attempting to strangle this new thing in its cradle.

Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive" was issued, giving great encouragement and strength to the poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: "Chairman Mao supports us, we must make Chairman Mao proud." "The class enemies oppose us running a school, which proves that we are right." Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," the Program Village Agricultural Labor School became better and better. In August 1966, the number of students increased from forty-eight at the beginning of the school to two hundred sixty-seven. The school presented a lively scene.

However, the struggle did not end. Just as the Program Village Agricultural Labor School was advancing victoriously under Chairman Mao's guidance, a cultural and educational section chief from the district came, saying, "Strengthen leadership." This section chief, as soon as he got off the car, criticized this and that as "not regular," and blamed that and that as "not like it." He installed telephones, bought supplies, painted classrooms, repaired school gates, and carried out a big campaign of "regularization," attempting to bring the students who were living scattered in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants back to the school, conspiring to pull this school back to the old revisionist road. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw that this person's intentions were not good, so they drove him away.

In February 1967, a handful of capitalist roaders within the old county committee sent people to Program, announcing the school's "three major crimes": first, "illegal," second, "not regular," third, "no future." They ordered it to be dissolved immediately, attempting to cut it off with one stroke. Under the persecution of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, this school's two hundred nineteen students from outside the commune were forced to leave school and return home. Revolutionary cadres at the county and commune levels who supported this school were subjected to brutal struggles. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Program firmly believed that the road guided by Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" was absolutely correct. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, boundless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they fought a head-on struggle with a handful of capitalist roaders. More than forty poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary students went to the city to rebel against the capitalist roaders, and refuted the so-called "three major crimes" that a handful of capitalist roaders had imposed on the poor and lower-middle peasants.

What is "illegal"? Whose law is it? Poor and lower-middle peasants are the natural owners of rural culture. Poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools is a matter of course. They said: "We have firmly grasped the power of rural education, and we have firmly established agricultural labor schools. You do not recognize it, we recognize it. We run schools without your approval. Cutting off the Program Village Agricultural Labor School will not cut off our hearts as poor and lower-middle peasants."

What is "not regular"? Poor and lower-middle peasants said, "regularity" has class characteristics, there is proletarian regularity, and there is bourgeois regularity. Poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools have smashed the "regularity" of the revisionist educational line of Chinese Khrushchev, and this thorough revolutionary spirit is very good!

What is "no future"? Poor and lower-middle peasants said, the countryside is a vast world, and we warmly welcome revolutionary intellectuals who are red in the countryside and specialized in the countryside. Following the bright road guided by Chairman Mao to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers is the road to light, and following the dead-end road advocated by Chinese Khrushchev of "studying to become an official" is a dead end.

After two years of class struggle, the Program Village Agricultural Labor School has become more and more consolidated. It is advancing victoriously along the course guided by Chairman Mao.

    贫下中农管理的一所新型学校
    ——河南省新蔡县涧头公社程庄农业劳动学校调查
    河南省革命委员会
    河南省新蔡县涧头公社程庄农业劳动学校，是按照毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的伟大方针，由贫下中农亲手创办、亲自管理的一所抗大式的学校。
    两年多来，这所学校已为农村培养出一批有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，为农村的教育革命闯出了一条崭新的道路。目前，新蔡县二十个公社都已办起了程庄式的农业劳动学校。
    为贫下中农子女开门
    程庄农业劳动学校的前身，是一所社办农业中学。一九六四年春刚开办时，贫下中农高高兴兴地把自己的子女送去上学，还拨了七十亩好地给“农中”作试验田。但是，由于资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象没有改变，“农中”贯彻的还是中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的那一套，走的还是“三脱离”（脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，脱离生产实践）的老路。结果，把学生教懒了，把试验田种荒了。贫下中农说：“农中不农，脱离斗争，关门读书，越读越修。”一九六六年三月，程庄大队的贫下中农，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的无比愤慨，革了“农中”的命，夺了“农中”的权。在县、社革命干部的支持下，自己办起了崭新的程庄农业劳动学校。
    这所学校废除了旧学校的“一长制”，实行民主办校。文化大革命以来，在大队革委会的领导下，建立了有贫下中农代表、革命干部、革命学生参加的三结合的教育革命委员会。
    这所学校为贫下中农子女开门。第一期学生全部都是贫下中农子女，其中多数是初中生，也有少数高中生和高小生。学生由大队推荐，公社保送，社来社去。
    这所学校由贫下中农当老师。学生全部住在贫下中农家里，自始至终和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同批判。第二期八十五名学生，分别住在八十四户贫下中农家里。贫下中农对学生进行阶级教育和劳动教育。学生帮助贫下中农学文化，一起活学活用毛主席著作。农业技术课请具有丰富生产实践经验的贫下中农担任老师，三名农业技术员作辅导。原来“农中”转来的两个民办教师，和学生一样，与贫下中农实行“五同”，接受贫下中农的再教育。
    这所学校突出无产阶级政治，坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争。学校分政治、军事、文化、技术、劳动等五门课。以政治课为主，通读《毛泽东选集》，熟背《毛主席语录》，以“老三篇”为座右铭，条条落实毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，改造世界观。军事课，学生同民兵编在一起进行活动，学习解放军的四个第一、三八作风。文化课，同队里青年在一起，组织了读报、广播、宣传等组，开展文娱活动，宣传毛泽东思想。技术课，学习棉花、小麦、玉米、红薯等主要农作物的栽培管理技术和植物保护知识，兼学农业机械和机电常识。劳动课，除进行劳动锻炼外，还学习生产管理知识，掌握农时季节，合理安排农活。学制两年。半日学习，半日劳动。他们“不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习”。从种到收，两季棉花，一季小麦。做什么，学什么，学用结合，立竿见影。
    到这所学校参观，看不见校舍，找不到校长，分不清学生、老师和社员。这究竟是所什么学校？他们回答说：“这是一所毛泽东思想大学校。毛主席著作是我们最宝贵的课本，贫下中农是我们最好的老师，广阔天地是我们最理想的课堂。”
    贫下中农培养出来的一批新人
    一九六七年秋，程庄农业劳动学校，毕业了第一批五十一名学生。在这一批毕业生中，有两名原来是民办教师。他们当了两年贫下中农的学生，贫下中农已批准他们重新当教师。另外，还有一个从安徽来的高中生，他是一九六六年到这里参观时，被这所新型的学校所感动，自愿留下来当“留学生”的，毕业后回原籍当了农业技术员。本公社的四十八名毕业生，各大队争着要。被外公社要走了二十三名，分派到七个公社的十个重点大队。本公社留下的二十五名，分派到九个重点大队。他们到了那里，就同那里的贫下中农实行“五同”，深受贫下中农的欢迎。贫下中农称赞他们是“五员一兵”：毛泽东思想宣传员、学习毛主席著作辅导员、群众工作队队员、生产战斗员、农业技术员、基干民兵。
    从这所学校培养的学生有两个特点：一是思想过硬，忠于毛主席，安心农村，热爱劳动，和贫下中农心连心；二是有真本事，农活样样会，处处带头干。四十八名毕业生，两名参军被评为“五好”战士，一名当了大队革委会常委、会计，十七名被选为县里的活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表，其余的都成了公社活学活用毛主席著作积极分子。
    从这所学校培养出来的学生，同旧学校培养的学生是完全两样。一个从农学院毕业的技术员，搞了一块小麦试验田，不懂装懂，死搬书本。播种时，不听贫下中农的话，下种过早，结果，年内就拔节抽穗了，遇到霜冻，全部死亡。一个从程庄农业劳动学校毕业的青年，既有实际知识，又走群众路线，他搞六亩小麦试验田，创造了平均亩产七百八十斤的高产纪录。
    同程庄邻近的杨老庄大队，有一所全日制中学。过去，这所中学的学生，看不起程庄农业劳动学校，说：“跟土地爷打交道，没有一点出息。”可是，贫下中农的评价却完全相反，说全日制中学毕业的学生，“又好吃，又好穿，放到那儿也不沾。”劳动学校毕业的学生，“又能说，又能做，到那里那里欢迎”。
    教育革命正在改变着一切。两年来，程庄大队发生了翻天覆地的变化。程庄和杨老庄原来是一个大队，因为杨老庄富，程庄穷，在一九六一年分了队。头几年，程庄还赶不上杨老庄，自创办农业劳动学校后，大队管学校，学校促大队，活学活用毛泽东思想的热潮空前高涨，到处是革命大批判的战场，政治空气浓浓的。过去，程庄青年中有四百五十个文盲、半文盲，很快就有二百七十四个摘掉了文盲帽子，学会了读报、写批判文章。人变思想地换装。这两年，程庄的粮食、棉花产量大大超过了杨老庄。过去，程庄大队每年需要国家供应粮食十万多斤，一九六七年却向国家交售粮食二十多万斤。棉花产量，由一九六五年亩产四十八斤增至一百六十四斤。
    程庄农业劳动学校充分显示出了毛主席无产阶级教育路线的强大生命力和贫下中农管理学校的无比优越性。
    贫下中农管理学校是一场尖锐的阶级斗争
    程庄农业劳动学校的成长过程，始终贯穿着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。斗争的焦点，围绕着农村教育大权掌握在谁的手里，坚持什么方向，培养什么人的根本问题上。
    贫下中农管理学校是亘古未有的事。这所学校一出现，就遭到一小撮阶级敌人的恶毒攻击和百般刁难。一个地主分子说什么“人活一百，没见过‘大老粗’办学堂，斗大字不识一筐，还想当圣人。”旧县委内一小撮走资派说什么：“这所学校整天拿着毛著念，围着地头打转转，简直瞎胡闹！”开教师会议，不让这所学校的教师参加，拨教育经费，没有这所学校的份，妄图把这个新生事物扼杀在摇篮之中。
    毛主席的光辉“五·七”指示发表了，给了贫下中农以巨大的鼓舞和力量。他们说：“毛主席为俺们撑腰，俺们要为毛主席争气。”“阶级敌人反对我们办学校，这就证明我们办对了。”在毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉指引下，程庄农业劳动学校越办越好。一九六六年八月，学生由开学时的四十八人，发展到二百六十七人。学校呈现一派生气勃勃的景象。
    但是，斗争并没有结束。正当程庄农业劳动学校沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进的时候，专区来了一位文教科长，名之曰：“加强领导”。这位科长大人，下车伊始，批评这也“不正规”，指责那也“不象话”。又是安电话，又是购用具，粉刷教室，修理校门，大搞其“正规化”，妄想把分散住在贫下中农家里的学生又集中住到学校里来，阴谋把这所学校拉回到修正主义的老路上去。贫下中农一看此人来势不对，就把他轰跑了。
    一九六七年二月，旧县委内一小撮走资派又派人到程庄，宣布这所学校“三大罪状”：一曰“不合法”，二曰“不正规”，三曰“没出路”。勒令立即解散，妄图一刀砍掉。在资产阶级反动路线的迫害下，这个学校从外公社来的二百一十九名学生被迫离校回家。支持这所学校的县、社革命干部遭到残酷斗争。程庄的贫下中农坚信走毛主席“五·七”指示指引的道路全然没有错。他们怀着无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心，同一小撮走资派进行了针锋相对的斗争。四十余名贫下中农和革命学生，进城去造了走资派的反，义正词严地驳斥了一小撮走资派加在贫下中农头上的所谓“三大罪状”。
    什么“不合法”？是合那家的法？贫下中农是农村文化的当然主人。贫下中农管理学校是天经地义的。他们说：“农村教育大权我们掌定了，农业劳动学校我们办定了。你们不承认，我们承认。我们办学校，不要你们批准。砍掉程庄农业劳动学校，砍不掉俺贫下中农的心。”
    什么“不正规”？贫下中农说，“正规”是有阶级性的，有无产阶级的正规，有资产阶级的正规，贫下中农管理学校，砸烂了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的那套“正规”，这种彻底的革命精神好得很！
    什么“没出路”？贫下中农说，农村是一个广阔的天地，我们热烈欢迎红在农村、专在农村的革命知识分子。走毛主席指引的同工农兵相结合的道路，是光明大道，走中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“读书做官”的道路，是死胡同。
    程庄农业劳动学校，经过两年来阶级斗争的洗礼，越来越巩固了。它正沿着毛主席指引的航向乘胜前进。
