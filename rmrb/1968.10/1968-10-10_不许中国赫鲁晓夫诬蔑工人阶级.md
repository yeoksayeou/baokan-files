Do Not Allow the Chinese Khrushchev to Slander the Working Class

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class has the greatest foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in its revolutionary spirit." The Chinese Khrushchev, however, blathers on about how "factories run by capitalists were taken over by workers, turned into cooperatives, but collapsed after a couple of months." He also says: "Workers divided up the factory, you took a stool, I took a chair, ... and as a result, production was disrupted..." This is a pure slander against our working class.

The working class is the most selfless and most talented. Take our working class at the Fengfeng Coal Mine, for example. In 1945, after the Japanese imperialists surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek came to seize the fruits of victory in the war of resistance. Capitalists, in order to save their own skins, abandoned the factories and mines. At that time, we workers at Fengfeng Mine, in order to prevent the factories and mines from being seized by the Kuomintang, risked our lives day and night to move the machinery, guard the mines, and bury the equipment. After defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries, we dug up the equipment piece by piece and reinstalled it to resume production. Now these old machines have long been replaced by modern equipment, but the old workers still can't bear to throw them away, because they are the machines that the working class protected with their blood and sweat!

After liberation, we workers, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created," have worked hard and self-reliantly. After more than a decade of arduous struggle, we have expanded the original small coal pits into a large modern mine. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and established a new revolutionary power organ—the Revolutionary Committee. We closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and continuously and deeply carry out the great criticism, thoroughly criticizing the revisionist line of "expert management," "technology first," "one-man management," and "material incentives" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. We smashed an entire set of revisionist rules and regulations that "control, restrict, deduct, and fine" workers. The revolution has promoted production, and Fengfeng Mine has seen an unprecedented new situation. The broad masses of workers, with hearts loyal to Chairman Mao, have created the highest production level since the mine's establishment and technical innovations at the world's advanced level that bourgeois technical "authorities" dare not even think of, making new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Countless facts have shown that the working class is the leading class, the creator of social wealth, the most selfless class. The working class does not think about "a stool or a chair under one's nose" as the Chinese Khrushchev says, but thinks about the fate of all laboring people in the world, as Marx said: only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself. Only those who exploit and oppress workers, who live off the blood and sweat of the working people, are the most stupid and selfish egoists. They care about nothing but money and their own lives. For the sake of their own lives, they can give up everything. The Chinese Khrushchev completely reverses black and white, reverses history, slanders our working class, and deliberately turns the protectors of the factories into "thieves," the builders into "destroyers," and the wise into "fools." His purpose is to create public opinion for his restoration of capitalism, attempting to let the already overthrown bourgeoisie and Kuomintang reactionaries return to power and seize our enterprises again, oppressing us workers once more. We must take up the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev's all revisionist fallacies, raise our political awareness in the struggle, and unite closely with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres. Together, we will fight the enemy and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 不许中国赫鲁晓夫诬蔑工人阶级

    不许中国赫鲁晓夫诬蔑工人阶级
    河北省革委会委员、峰峰矿务局革委会副主任、工人　陈树清
    峰峰矿务局革命委员会常委、工人　张长春
    毛主席教导说：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“资本家办的工厂被工人接收，办了合作社，但办了一两个月就垮台了。”还说什么：工人“把工厂分了，你搬一个凳子，我搬一个椅子，……结果工厂的生产就破坏了……。”这纯粹是对我们工人阶级的最大诬蔑。
    工人阶级是最大公无私、最有才能的。就拿我们峰峰煤矿工人阶级来说吧，一九四五年日本帝国主义投降后，蒋介石来抢夺抗战胜利果实，资本家为了自己的狗命，扔下工厂、矿井不管了。当时我们峰峰矿工人阶级为了使工厂、矿山不让国民党抢去，冒着生命危险日夜转移机器，守卫矿山，把设备一件件埋藏起来，等打垮了国民党反动派以后，又一件件运回来，安装上投入生产。现在这些古老的机器早已被现代化的设备代替了，可是老工人还是舍不得扔掉，因为这是工人阶级用血汗保护下来的呀！
    解放后，我们工人阶级遵循伟大领袖毛主席“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来”的教导，奋发图强，自力更生，经过十几年的艰苦奋斗，把原来的一、两个小小土煤窑扩建成一个具有现代化设备的大型矿山。无产阶级文化大革命中，我们工人阶级夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，建立了新的革命权力机构——革命委员会。我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，发扬了无产阶级彻底革命精神，不断地深入地开展革命大批判，彻底地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所搞的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“一长制”、“物质刺激”的反革命修正主义路线，砸烂了一整套“管、卡、扣、罚”工人的修正主义规章制度。革命促进了生产，峰峰煤矿出现了从未有过的新气象，广大工人凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，创造出建矿以来生产最高水平，以及资产阶级技术“权威”想都不敢想的具有世界先进水平的技术革新项目，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了新的贡献。无数事实说明了工人阶级是领导阶级，是社会财富的创造者，工人阶级是最大公无私的阶级，工人阶级想的完全不是象中国赫鲁晓夫所说的“鼻子尖底下的一把椅子、一条凳子”，而想到的是世界全体劳动人民的命运，正如马克思所说：只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己。只有那些剥削工人，压迫工人，靠喝劳动人民血汗的地主、资本家才是最愚蠢、最自私的利己主义者，他们除了钱就是一条狗命，为了个人狗命可以什么都不要。而中国赫鲁晓夫完全颠倒黑白、颠倒历史，诬蔑我们工人阶级，硬把工厂的保护者说成是“偷盗者”，把建设者说成是“破坏者”，把聪明者说成是“糊涂虫”。其目的就是为他复辟资本主义制造舆论，企图让已经被打倒的资产阶级、国民党反动派再上台，再抢夺我们的企业，重新压在我们工人阶级头上。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底批倒、批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的一切反革命修正主义谬论，在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，和广大贫下中农、红卫兵小将、革命的知识分子、革命干部紧密团结，共同对敌，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
