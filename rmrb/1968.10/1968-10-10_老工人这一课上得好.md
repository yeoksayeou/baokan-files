"Exactly! This is what a good descendant of the poor and lower-middle peasants should be like." Comrade Tan Chaozheng from the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team gave a thumbs up to a student beside him. The praise from Comrade Tan made the student's face turn red. She felt both ashamed and grateful, saying, "If it weren't for the Worker Propaganda Team using Mao Zedong Thought to educate me, I wouldn't have been able to get out of this 'confusion'!"

What exactly happened? Let's start from the beginning.

The students at the nursing school attached to Guilin Workers' Hospital were about to graduate, and they were discussing their assignments in small groups. Comrade Tan from the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team came to the nursing school and, during conversations with some students, learned that a student from a poor peasant background did not want to return to the countryside to work. Comrade Tan decided to have a talk with her.

One evening after dinner, Comrade Tan had the first heart-to-heart talk with the student. However, after talking for over an hour, the student just kept her head down and didn't say a word. Comrade Tan felt that if he didn't educate this daughter of a poor peasant, it would be disloyal to Chairman Mao. He talked to her for several evenings in a row, and the student's inner thoughts began to stir. On the fourth day, Comrade Tan called the student to a shady spot under a tree. First, he studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with her: "Most or many of the students trained in old schools can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some have made inventions and creations. However, they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must give them re-education to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers."

Then, Comrade Tan shared his personal experiences with the student, describing the tragic scene of his family of four dying from illness in the old society because they couldn't afford treatment. He said, "In the old society, where was the place for us poor people? It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the fire. The poor and lower-middle peasants sent you to study, but after learning some skills, you don't want to return to the countryside and serve the workers and peasants. Can you face Chairman Mao, your savior? Can you face the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants? We, the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants, must not forget our roots!"

The student's eyes welled up, and she lowered her head in sorrow. Comrade Tan continued, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants; otherwise, they will achieve nothing.' Only by combining with the workers and peasants can intellectuals find the correct path."

The student's heart was illuminated by Chairman Mao's latest instructions. She recalled the day she left home to attend the nursing school, when her mother held her hand and said, "Child, in the old society, we couldn't get medical treatment when we were sick. Today, Chairman Mao leads us to stand up and become the masters. After you go to the nursing school, you must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and practice hard skills to serve us, the poor and lower-middle peasants, in the future." She painfully realized that after coming to the nursing school, she had not studied Chairman Mao's works well, had relaxed her ideological transformation, and gradually lost the spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants. She angrily denounced Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the hospital who promoted the revisionist educational line. She said, "A small handful of capitalist roaders in the hospital often spread the reactionary fallacy of 'study hard and stay in the city' in the nursing school. I was poisoned by them and fell into their trap. Today, it is Chairman Mao who sent the Worker Propaganda Team to pull me back from the brink of danger. I must remember Chairman Mao's great instruction to 'shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside' and combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, accept their re-education, walk the path of the 'barefoot doctor,' and become a red medical worker welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

Seeing that the student's awareness had been raised, Comrade Tan was overjoyed and kept nodding in approval, "Exactly! This is what a good descendant of the poor and lower-middle peasants should be like."

    老工人这一课上得好
    “对！这才是贫下中农的好后代。”工人毛泽东思想宣传队的覃超仲同志伸着大拇指，对着身边的一位学员说。老覃同志的称赞，使这位学员的脸唰地一下变红了。她既惭愧又感激地说：“要不是工人宣传队用毛泽东思想来教育我，这个‘迷魂阵’，我还走不出来哩！”这究竟是怎么回事？还得从头说起。
    桂林市工人医院附设护士学校的学员快要毕业了，她们在三三两两地议论着分配问题。工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员老覃同志来到护校，在和一些学员的谈话中，了解到一位贫农出身的学员，不愿回农村工作，老覃决定和她谈一谈。
    这天，吃过晚饭，老覃同志和这位学员进行了第一次谈心。谁知，谈了一个多小时，这位学员只是低着头，一声也没有吭。老覃觉得不把这个贫农女儿教育过来，就是对毛主席的不忠。一连谈了几个晚上，这位学员的内心开始活动起来了，暴露了一些活思想。第四天，老覃同志把这位学员叫到树荫底下，首先和她一起学习了毛主席的最新指示：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”接着，老覃同志用他的亲身经历，向这位学员讲述了在旧社会由于无钱治病，他一家四口人眼睁睁病死的悲惨情景。他说：“在旧社会，哪有我们穷人的地位？是毛主席把我们从火海中救了出来，贫下中农又把你送来学习，而你学了点技术以后，却不愿意回农村，不愿意为工农兵服务，能对得起救命恩人毛主席吗？能对得起工人、贫下中农吗？咱们贫下中农的子女可不能忘本啊！”这位学员的眼圈湿了，难过地低下了头。老覃同志又继续说：“毛主席教导我们：‘知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。’只有和工农群众结合在一块，才是知识分子唯一正确的道路。”
    毛主席最新指示的灿烂阳光，照亮了这位学员的心。她回想刚考上护校离家的那天，妈妈拉着她的手说：“孩子，旧社会咱们有病得不到医治。今天，毛主席领导我们翻了身，当家作了主人。你到护校以后，要活学活用毛泽东思想，苦练过硬本领，今后好好为咱贫下中农服务。”她痛切地感到来护校以后，没有学好毛主席著作，放松了思想改造，慢慢地丢掉了贫下中农的本色。她愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工人医院的代理人所推行的修正主义教育路线。她说：“工人医院中的一小撮走资派，经常到护校散布‘好好学技术，今后可以留在城市工作’的反动谬论。我中了他们的毒，上了他们的当。今天，是毛主席派来的工人宣传队把我从危险的边缘拉了回来，我一定要牢记毛主席‘把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去’的伟大教导，和工农兵相结合，接受工农兵的再教育，走‘赤脚医生’的道路，做一个工农兵欢迎的红色医护人员。”
    老覃同志见这位学员的觉悟提高了，心里有说不出的高兴，不停地点头称赞：“对！这才是贫下中农的好后代。”
