A cheerful song faded away, and Fu Shuzhen, holding a small bucket in one hand and a small ladle in the other, walked out of the pigpen. An old comrade carrying a shovel came towards her, joking as he walked, "Old Fu, you sure are enjoying being a pig keeper!" Fu stopped singing, looked up, and replied, "The more I do this job, the more I enjoy it!"

In early May, the farm leadership decided to have Fu Shuzhen feed the pigs. At that time, although Fu Shuzhen didn't say anything, she felt uncomfortable inside: "I am a commune's Youth League secretary. Asking me to feed pigs?! Who doesn't know that feeding pigs is a dirty job? If acquaintances see me, how embarrassing it would be." Whenever someone called her a pig keeper, her face would flush with embarrassment, and she felt very uncomfortable. Her mind was troubled, and her actions went astray. Several pigs were fed for many days, but they didn't get fat. The PLA and comrades noticed her mood change, so they sat her down by the oil lamp, studied the "Three Articles," talked about her thoughts, and held a small study class on Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's warm teachings were like bright lamps in her eyes and alarm bells in her ears. Fu Shuzhen compared her thoughts with Chairman Mao's teachings and broke out in a cold sweat. She excitedly said, "It's not that the job of feeding pigs is dirty, but my thoughts are dirty; it's not that the job of feeding pigs is shameful, but my untransformed soul is shameful!" From then on, she treated the pig farm as a good classroom for transforming her thoughts. She tied up her hair, put on a hat, took off her nylon socks, put on sturdy shoes, rolled up her pants, tied on an apron, and spent the whole day either carrying slop or picking up vegetable leaves, either mending the pigpen or repairing the pigsty. At this time, Old Fu looked at the fat pigs in the pen with special affection. When comrades called her a pig keeper, she didn't find it offensive but felt even more affectionate. By the end of May, the farm bought two more pigs. The journey was far and the weather was hot, so the pigs refused to eat. This worried Fu Shuzhen. She spent the whole day fussing over the two pigs, sometimes making the food thick, sometimes making it thin. After Fu's careful care, the two pigs, like the others, became plump and round.

At the study class to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Comrade Fu Shuzhen recalled the journey of the past five months and said with deep feelings, "From an official to a keeper, this is just a change of one character, but this one-character change has made me discard the bad thoughts of an official and adopt the good thoughts of wholeheartedly serving the people. This change is so profound! I must forever follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao and keep walking, forever!"

    由“官”到“倌”
    一阵愉快的歌声过去，富淑珍一手提小桶，一手拿小勺走出了猪圈。一个扛着铁锹的老同志迎面而来，边走边开玩笑地说：“老富啊！你这‘倌’当得真带劲哩！”老富停住歌声，抬起头来回答道：“我这倌就是越当越起劲！”
    五月初，场领导决定要富淑珍喂猪。当时，富淑珍虽然嘴上没说啥，可是心里直别扭：“我是个公社团委书记，让我来喂猪？！谁不知道喂猪是个脏活，要叫熟人看见了，该多难为情。”别人一喊她猪倌，她脸上立刻火辣辣的，很不是滋味。思想上结了疙瘩，行动上就要出岔，几口猪喂了好些天，就是不见肥。支左解放军和同志们察觉到她情绪上的变化，便拉着她坐在油灯下，学习“老三篇”，谈起心里话，开办了小型毛泽东思想学习班。毛主席的亲切教导，字字如明灯，亮在眼前；句句似警钟，响在耳边。富淑珍以毛主席的教导，对照自己的思想，不禁出了身冷汗，她激动地说：“不是喂猪的活脏，而是我的思想脏；不是喂猪的活见不得人，而是我没改造好的灵魂见不得人！”从此以后，她把猪场当做改造思想的极好课堂，辫子一盘，帽子一戴，脱下尼龙袜，换上硬帮鞋，挽起裤脚，系上布围裙，整天不是打泔水，就是捡菜叶，不是垫猪圈，就是修猪棚。这时候的老富看见这满圈肥猪分外喜爱，同志们再喊她猪倌时，她不但不觉刺耳，反而感到倍加亲切。五月底，场里又买来两口克郎猪，路远天热上了火，老是不肯吃食，这可急坏了富淑珍。她整天围着这两口猪打转转，一会儿弄点稠的，一会儿弄点稀的，经过老富连晌搭黑的精心料理，这两口猪同其它猪一样，也都变得滚瓜溜圆了。
    在落实毛主席最新指示的学习班上，富淑珍同志回忆五个月走过的历程，深有感受地说：“由官到倌，这只是一字之变，可是，这一字之变，却使自己变走了‘官’老爷的坏思想，变来了完全彻底为人民服务的好思想，这个变该有多么深刻啊！我一定要永远沿着毛主席指引的革命大道走下去，永远走下去！”
