The Tunisian reactionary regime has recently intensified its suppression of the student movement in Tunisia. On September 16, the "National Security Court" of Tunisia brazenly sentenced 104 Tunisian students, professors, and lawyers to prison terms ranging from three months to fourteen years and six months. The charges against them were "opposing the current Tunisian government."

In March of this year, students in the capital held large-scale demonstrations, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the Bourguiba government's alignment with U.S. imperialism and its failure to support Arab countries in their resistance against U.S. and Israeli aggression. The demonstrators also demanded the release of a student arrested by the Tunisian authorities.

Faced with this massive demonstration, the Tunisian reactionary regime was in a state of panic. They deployed military and police forces to suppress the protests, arresting over a hundred students, professors, and lawyers, and subjecting some of them to severe torture. Following this mass arrest, Tunisian President Bourguiba, in a speech, threatened that the Tunisian government would not tolerate "troublemakers." If the "stability" of Tunisia was threatened, he declared, he would take further repressive measures.

     突尼斯反动当局加紧镇压学生运动
    突尼斯反动政府最近变本加厉地疯狂镇压突尼斯的学生运动。突尼斯“国家安全法庭”九月十六日悍然判处一百零四名突尼斯大学生、教授和律师等以三个月到十四年零六个月期限不等的徒刑，加给他们的罪名是“反对突尼斯现政权”。
    今年三月间，突尼斯首都大学生举行大规模示威游行，对投靠美帝、不支持阿拉伯国家抗击美帝和以色列的侵略的布尔吉巴政府，表示极大的不满。示威者还强烈要求释放被突尼斯当局逮捕的一名大学生。
    在当时这一声势浩大的示威游行面前，突尼斯反动当局惊恐万状，出动军警大肆镇压，逮捕了一百多名大学生、教授和律师，并且对其中的一些人进行严刑拷打。在这次大逮捕之后，突尼斯总统布尔吉巴在一次讲话中大肆叫嚣说，突尼斯政府将不容忍“肇事者”，如果突尼斯的“稳定”受到威胁，他打算进一步采取镇压行动。
