The Worker-Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Hebei Normal University, in the process of promoting and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, has helped revolutionary teachers and students establish a good learning style of linking theory with practice as advocated by Chairman Mao. This has promoted the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the university, and the school has quickly taken on a new and vibrant appearance.

The struggle, criticism, and transformation at Hebei Normal University had achieved some success before the Worker-Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team arrived. However, due to the existence of a bad learning style among some revolutionary teachers and students, where theory was separated from practice and words did not match deeds, the struggle, criticism, and transformation were hindered from further development. The Worker-Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, while vigorously promoting and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the focus on rectifying the learning style. In the study class, the team members and revolutionary teachers and students together studied Chairman Mao's teachings on learning style, extensively discussed the harm of bourgeois bad learning style, deeply explored the roots of bourgeois bad learning style, and launched a broad and in-depth criticism of bourgeois bad learning style. Through the study, revolutionary teachers and students realized that in dealing with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the question of whether to firmly implement them or to learn without applying them, and to have words that do not match deeds, is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Everyone exposed the following three main manifestations of the bourgeois bad learning style of words not matching deeds and theory not being linked with practice: First, in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, there was a lack of deep proletarian feelings, the class enemies were not fought fiercely, the old educational system was not hated deeply, the criticism was not thorough, and the transformation was not swift. Second, the bourgeois worldview had not been thoroughly changed, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution were understood from the standpoint of bourgeois individualism. Although they talked about being pioneers of educational revolution, in their minds, they still preserved the independent kingdom of bourgeois individualism. After their individualist plans hit a wall, they began to calculate "struggle, criticize, and leave." Third, there was a lack of a strong spirit of self-revolution. On the one hand, they expressed a willingness to accept re-education from the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, but on the other hand, they did not dare to openly reveal their active thoughts, and during self-criticism, they covered up and were afraid of pain and shame.

To further help revolutionary teachers and students establish a learning style of linking theory with practice and seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Worker-Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team focused on class education for the revolutionary teachers and students. They used various forms such as bitter memory meetings, heart-to-heart talks, eating bitter memory meals, and performing bitter memory plays to extensively and deeply carry out activities of recalling bitterness and sweetness and denouncing the revisionist educational line. The team members, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, closely focused on the issue of power, extensively recalled the class bitterness and national bitterness of the old society, spoke extensively about the pain of being powerless, the difficulty of seizing power, and the importance of defending the proletarian dictatorship; they extensively criticized the revisionist educational line pushed by Liu Shaoqi. Through these activities, revolutionary teachers and students understood that the working class is closest to Chairman Mao, the most thorough in revolution, because they have the deepest proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have an extremely strong love for the new society, and an extremely strong hatred for the old society. The broad masses of teachers and students found the gap between themselves and the working class, and learned from the working class, one after another rising up to denounce and criticize the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hebei Normal University in pushing the revisionist educational line, denouncing the poisoning of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line on themselves, and determined to thoroughly change the old learning style. The class cadres of the Mathematics Department's Class 64-3 used to create divisions. After the Revolutionary Committee of the school did multiple rounds of work, they only said with their mouths that they wanted to unite and do a good job, but there was no action. After the Worker-Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team conducted class education for them, they immediately held a discussion meeting at night, wrote a determination letter, and wanted to strengthen unity, do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation with practical actions to support the leadership of the working class and follow Chairman Mao in revolution. The next day, they convened a meeting of the entire class to criticize the unrepentant capitalist-roader and the reactionary academic "authority."

The Worker-Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team also followed Chairman Mao's teaching that intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants, actively organizing revolutionary teachers and students to go to coal mines, factories, and rural areas to participate in collective production labor, hold study classes, and struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This helped them transform their thoughts in the practical struggle of revolution and production, and overcome the bourgeois style of thought where theory is separated from practice and words do not match deeds.

Through the establishment of the learning style of linking theory with practice as advocated by Chairman Mao, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of revolutionary teachers and students has rapidly increased. Currently, the struggle, criticism, and transformation at Hebei Normal University is being carried out more deeply. A handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have been hiding in the revolutionary ranks for many years have been one by one exposed. The deep criticism and the cleanup of class ranks are closely combined, and the entire campus is filled with classrooms for studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and everywhere is a battlefield for struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism.

    驻河北师范大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队在宣传落实毛主席一系列最新指示中
    帮助革命师生树立理论联系实际好学风
    通过举办学习班，狠抓阶级教育，斗私批修等活动，革命师生认识到：对待毛主席的最新指示，是坚决执行，还是学而不用、言行不一，这是对毛主席忠不忠的重大问题。革命师生提高了觉悟，学校斗批改步步深入，很快出现新面貌
    新华社石家庄二十二日电　驻河北师范大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队在宣传落实毛主席一系列最新指示的过程中，帮助革命师生大立毛主席亲自倡导的“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风，促进了学校斗、批、改的步步深入，学校很快出现了生气勃勃的新面貌。
    河北师范大学的斗、批、改，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻以前虽然取得了一定成绩，但由于部分革命师生存在着理论脱离实际、言行不一的坏学风，障碍着斗、批、改的深入发展。工人毛泽东思想宣传队在大张旗鼓地宣传落实毛主席一系列最新指示的时候，举办了以整顿学风为中心的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，宣传队员和革命师生员工一起，大学毛主席关于学风问题的教导，大摆资产阶级坏学风的危害，大挖资产阶级坏学风的根源，对资产阶级坏学风展开了一场广泛深入的批判。经过学习，革命师生认识到，对待毛主席的最新指示，是坚决执行，还是学而不用，言行不一，这是对毛主席忠不忠的重大问题。大家揭发出言行不一、理论与实际脱节的资产阶级坏学风主要有以下三种表现：一、在贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示中，缺乏深厚的无产阶级感情，对阶级敌人斗得不狠，对旧的教育制度恨得不深，批得不透，改得不快。二、资产阶级世界观没有彻底改变，站在资产阶级个人主义立场上去理解毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，口头上讲要做教育革命的闯将，思想深处仍保存着资产阶级个人主义的独立王国。在个人主义的打算碰壁以后，就盘算着“斗批走”。三、缺乏强烈的自我革命精神。一方面表示愿意接受工人阶级和贫下中农的再教育，但是又不敢大胆地亮出自己的活思想，斗私时遮遮盖盖，怕疼怕丑。
    为了进一步帮助广大革命师生树立“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，工人毛泽东思想宣传队对革命师生狠抓了阶级教育。他们利用忆苦会、谈心会和吃忆苦饭、演忆苦戏等多种形式，广泛深入地开展了忆苦思甜和控诉修正主义教育路线的活动。宣传队的队员们以毛主席的最新指示为纲，紧紧围绕着政权问题，大忆旧社会的阶级苦和民族苦，大讲无权的痛苦，夺权的艰难，保卫无产阶级政权的重要；大批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义教育路线。通过这些活动，使广大革命师生懂得，工人阶级跟毛主席最紧，革命最彻底，是因为他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情最深，对新社会有无比强烈的爱，对旧社会有无比强烈的恨。广大师生找到了自己同工人阶级的差距，就向工人阶级学习，纷纷起来控诉批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河北师大的代理人推行修正主义教育路线的滔天罪行，控诉反革命修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害，决心彻底改变旧学风。数学系六四——三班的班干部过去闹对立，经校革委会多次做工作，他们口头上都说要团结起来搞好工作，就是不见行动。工人毛泽东思想宣传队向他们进行阶级教育以后，他们连夜召开座谈会，写决心书，要以加强团结，搞好斗、批、改的实际行动来拥护工人阶级的领导，紧跟毛主席干革命。第二天，他们就召集全班同学批判了顽固不化的走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队还遵循毛主席关于知识分子必须和工农群众相结合的教导，积极组织广大革命师生到煤矿、工厂、农村参加集体生产劳动，办学习班，和工农兵一起斗私批修，帮助他们在革命和生产斗争的实践中改造思想，克服理论脱离实际、言行不一的资产阶级思想作风。
    经过大立毛主席倡导的“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风，广大革命师生阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高。目前，河北师范大学的斗、批、改更加深入地开展。一小撮在革命队伍中隐藏了多年的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，一个个被挖了出来。大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合，整个校园到处是大学习、大宣传、大落实毛主席最新指示的课堂，到处是斗私批修的战场。
