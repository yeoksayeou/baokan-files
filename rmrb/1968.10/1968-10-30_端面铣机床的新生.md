Edition: 5

The capitalists and reactionaries in the Longzhi Forging and Press Machine Tool Factory in Shanxi Province are frantically promoting the reactionary line of "experts managing the factory" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. They slander our workers' technological revolution as "foolish nonsense." Today, we must fight for Chairman Mao and for the glory of the working class. We must definitely revive the face milling machine, which was sentenced to "death" by the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" four years ago, and make it serve the construction of socialism and support the world revolution.

This was the impassioned speech made by the veteran worker Guo Enpu at the criticism meeting. All the workers present at the meeting decided to take concrete actions to fiercely criticize the reactionary line of "experts" and "authorities" managing the factory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. They decided to act immediately. With the support of the Revolutionary Committee and the stationed People's Liberation Army, they quickly formed a three-in-one innovation team consisting of leading cadres, worker technicians, and veteran workers.

The battle to reform the face milling machine began. Comrades stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings: self-reliance and hard struggle. Without blueprints, workers designed them themselves; without materials, workers found them themselves; without equipment, workers modified them themselves. After repeated research, they finally succeeded in making the blueprints and completed the preparatory work. Just as things were proceeding smoothly, they were blocked by a difficult problem: the twelve holes on the face could not be processed. The innovation team immediately held a meeting with the worker masses to discuss solutions. Everyone was anxious. The veteran worker Huang Jiachai said, "In the past, we followed the Eighth Route Army to set up 'guerrilla factories' in the Taihang Mountains, ensuring the victory of the battle. Today, under socialist conditions, what is this little difficulty?" Based on his more than thirty years of experience, he boldly proposed to process one hole at a time with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong. This problem was quickly solved.

The processing of each part of the machine was completed, but the machine was tall and the workshop was low, and there was no large crane, making it impossible to install. According to the bourgeois technical "authorities," only "standardized" large factories could complete this process. At this time, the class enemies also took the opportunity to attack, saying, "A small factory is a small factory, you are a toad dreaming of eating swan meat." What to do? The workers unanimously said, "What big factories can do, we can do; what big factories cannot do, we can do." They all gathered around the machine, thinking of ways and offering suggestions. When their bodies were tired and their eyes were red from strain, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They established an unshakable confidence. Under the suggestion of the veteran worker Guo Enpu, everyone finally came up with a solution and completed the installation task in just half a day. This method cannot be found in the "encyclopedia" of bourgeois technical "authorities." These bourgeois technical "authorities" will never understand it. The working class has given the class enemies and the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" a hard blow with their actual actions.

With the strong assistance of the stationed People's Liberation Army, the three-in-one innovation team fully played the leading role of the working class. They, with the boundless enthusiasm unleashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, designed, reformed, manufactured, and installed more than six hundred parts, completed more than one thousand processes, and solved the long-standing difficult problems of the past four or five years. They successfully developed a versatile machine with boring, drilling, grinding, and milling capabilities, reaching the advanced level of the state, and making this face milling machine, which was sentenced to "death" by the bourgeois technical "authorities," enter socialist construction with a new look. The workers deeply felt that the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought can lead everything and create any miracle.

    端面铣机床的新生
    “我们山西省长治锻压机床厂的走资派，疯狂地推行中国赫鲁晓夫的什么‘专家治厂’的资产阶级反动路线，诬蔑我们工人搞技术革命‘是瞎胡闹’。今天，我们要为毛主席争气，为工人阶级争光，一定要让被资产阶级‘专家’、‘权威’宣判了四年‘死刑’的端面铣机床获得新生，让它为建设社会主义、支援世界革命服务。”
    这是老工人郭恩普在批判会上慷慨激昂的发言。参加大会的全体工人同志，决心以实际行动，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“专家”、“权威”治厂的那套资产阶级反动路线。说干就干，在革委会和驻厂解放军的支持下，立即组成了由领导干部、工人技术人员、老工人参加的三结合革新小组。
    改革端面铣机床的战斗打响了。同志们站在毛主席像前，高声背诵毛主席的教导：自力更生，艰苦奋斗。没有图纸，工人自己设计；没有材料，工人自己寻找；没有设备，工人自己改造。经过反复研究，终于成功地制出图纸，作好了准备工作。正当顺利进行的时候，被一道难关卡住了，端面上的十二个孔无法加工。革新小组立即和工人群众一块开会研究办法。大家心里都急开了锅，老工人黄家才说：“在过去我们跟随着八路军在太行山区办起了‘游击工厂’，保障了战斗的胜利。今天我们在社会主义条件下，碰到了这点困难算什么？”他根据三十多年的经验，大胆提出了以愚公移山的精神，一个孔一个孔地加工，这个难题很快就解决了。
    这台机床各部件加工已经完成，但是机身高大，厂房低矮，又没有大型起重机，无法安装。按照资产阶级的技术“权威”的说法，只有“正规化”的大工厂才能完成这道工序。这时阶级敌人也乘机攻击，说什么：“小工厂就是小工厂，你们是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉。”怎么办？工人们异口同声地说：“大厂能干的，我们也要干，大厂不能干的，我们也要干”。他们都围在机床边，想办法，出主意。身体累了，眼睛熬红了，他们就学习毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，树立了必胜的信心。在老工人郭恩普的提议下，大家终于想出了办法，仅用半天时间就完成了安装的任务。这种方法在资产阶级的技术“权威”的“百科全书”上是永远找不到的。这些资产阶级技术“权威”也是永远不会理解的。工人阶级用实际行动给了阶级敌人和资产阶级的什么“专家”“权威”们当头一棒。
    在驻厂解放军大力协助下，三结合革新小组充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，他们以无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，自己设计、自己改革、自己制造、自己安装了六百多部件，完成了一千多道工序，解决了四五年来的老大难问题，试制成功了具有镗床、钻孔、磨床、铣面等性能的万能机床，并达到了国家先进水平，使这个被资产阶级技术“权威”判了死刑的端面铣机床，以崭新的姿态投入到社会主义建设中去。工人们深深体会到：用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级能够领导一切，能够创造任何人间奇迹。
