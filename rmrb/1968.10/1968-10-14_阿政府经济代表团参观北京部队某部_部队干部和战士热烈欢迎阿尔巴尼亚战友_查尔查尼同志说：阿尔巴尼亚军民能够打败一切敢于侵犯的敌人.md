The Albanian Government Economic Delegation led by Comrade Adil Çarçani visited a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region today.

Around 10 AM, the Albanian comrades arrived at the military unit's base. Hundreds of officers, soldiers, workers, and family members of the unit greeted the Albanian comrades enthusiastically, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people. They waved the national flags of China and Albania, beat drums, and cheered loudly.

The Albanian comrades listened to the introduction by the unit's responsible comrade, Peng Xiuting, and a representative of the officers and soldiers, who reported on the unit's brief history and the situation of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They also visited a cultural revolution room of a platoon, the unit's rice processing workshop, machinery repair shop, food processing workshop, and sewing group, and watched a live-fire demonstration of infantry weapons and a performance by the unit's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda troupe.

During the visit, the Albanian comrades praised the unit's officers and soldiers for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, prioritizing the human factor, prioritizing ideological and political work, and exhibiting a revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. They also praised the unit's officers and soldiers for continuously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and making new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At the welcoming ceremony for the Albanian comrades held by the unit, the delegation leader, Comrade Adil Çarçani, spoke. Comrade Çarçani said that although Albania is surrounded by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries on all sides, like being at the edge of a pack of wolves, the heroic Albanian people, who hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, are not afraid. The Albanian people and the people's army can defeat any enemy that dares to invade Albanian territory. As Comrade Hoxha said, "The heroes who can intimidate the Albanian people have not existed in the past and have not emerged yet."

Comrade Çarçani said that under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people, regardless of age or gender, hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, actively engaging in socialist construction while defending the socialist motherland. Especially after the Soviet revisionist fascists led by Brezhnev and Kosygin occupied Czechoslovakia, the Albanian people have been fully mobilized, with high revolutionary awareness, ready at any time to strike against the aggression of imperialism and modern revisionism.

Today, the comrades accompanying the Albanian comrades on their visit included relevant responsible comrades Zhang Nansheng, Li Qiang, Xie Huai De, and Zhang Zhongru, among others.

    阿政府经济代表团参观北京部队某部
    部队干部和战士热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友
    查尔查尼同志说：阿尔巴尼亚军民能够打败一切敢于侵犯的敌人
    据新华社十三日讯　由阿迪尔·查尔查尼同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚政府经济代表团，今天参观访问了北京部队某部。
    上午十时许，阿尔巴尼亚战友来到部队驻地，部队干部、战士、职工、家属数百人，高举着中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的画像和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的画像，挥动中、阿两国国旗，敲锣打鼓，热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友。
    阿尔巴尼亚战友听了部队负责同志庞秀廷和干部战士代表介绍部队简史、汇报活学活用毛泽东思想的情况，参观了一个连队的文化革命室，部队的稻米加工房、机械修理所、副食加工房和缝补组，观看了步兵武器实弹射击和部队毛泽东思想宣传队战士业余演出队的演出。
    阿尔巴尼亚战友在参观中赞扬部队干部战士高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把人的因素放在首位，把思想政治工作放在首位和自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，赞扬部队干部战士不断落实毛主席最新指示，在无产阶级文化大革命中作出了新的贡献。
    在部队举行的欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友的大会上，代表团团长阿迪尔·查尔查尼同志讲了话。查尔查尼同志说，阿尔巴尼亚虽然四面被帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派包围，象处在一群恶狼的嘴边，但高举马克思列宁主义伟大红旗的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚毫不害怕。阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军能够打败一切敢于侵犯阿尔巴尼亚领土的敌人。正如霍查同志说的那样：“能够吓倒阿尔巴尼亚人的好汉，过去没有，现在也还没有生出来。”
    查尔查尼同志说，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民，不管男女老少，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，一面积极进行社会主义建设，一面保卫社会主义的祖国。特别是在勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修法西斯侵占捷克斯洛伐克以后，阿尔巴尼亚人民充分动员起来，以高度的革命觉悟，时刻准备打击帝国主义和现代修正主义的侵略。
    今天，陪同阿尔巴尼亚战友参观访问的，有我有关方面负责人张南生、李强、谢怀德、张中如等。
