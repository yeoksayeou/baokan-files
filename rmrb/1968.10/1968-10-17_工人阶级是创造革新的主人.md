The great leader Chairman Mao has recently issued a series of great directives:

"Follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among the workers," and "fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." Each directive issued has left us with an indescribable excitement that lasts for a long time.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." He has always taught us to rely on the workers and peasants and on intellectuals who can combine with workers and peasants to develop our country's science and technology.

China's Khrushchev, however, sings a different tune from Chairman Mao's teachings. He advocates relying on a small clique of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois "authorities." He says that "the progress of our country depends especially on the efforts of factory directors, engineers, and technicians"; "the progress of our country depends on the efforts of scientists, especially the old scientists." He is trying to push the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expertise." China's Khrushchev and his agents have suppressed, attacked, and belittled the innovations and creations of the working class in production struggles and scientific experiments. Now, we will use our personal experiences to denounce and criticize the persecution of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of science and technology.

We are workers who started as apprentices. In 1958, under the great directive of self-reliance and hard work issued by Chairman Mao, and under the radiance of the three red banners, we set our hearts on high aspirations and resolute wills, and displayed the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. Without any technical data and without asking the state for a single cent, we relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to create a new technology that our country did not yet have, thus creating the conditions for the trial production of semiconductor transistors in our country. At the same time, we also successfully produced the metal mesh used in electron microscopes, which previously had to be imported.

In 1961, our country needed to produce an important instrument that previously had to be imported. The production of this instrument required a precise graduated glass. The technical personnel of a certain factory, following foreign technical data and book knowledge, failed to produce it after more than half a year. Later, they brought a pile of foreign books to our factory and asked us to produce this precise graduated glass according to the foreign data. We looked at it with a magnifying glass and found that this graduated glass was not "mysterious" at all; we could definitely produce it. We said, "We don't understand foreign gadgets, and we don't recognize foreign words. We will use Chinese methods to produce it for you. Come back in half a month to get the sample!" They left the factory half-believing and half-doubting.

Half a month later, when they compared our produced graduated glass with the foreign product, they found that ours had a lower cost, simpler equipment, and a more convenient process, which was easy to promote. It was a slap in the face for those who believed in foreigners!

Ten years of practice have proven that the new technology we created with our own methods is one of the key technologies for the development of the electronics industry, attracting the attention of electronics production and research units across the country. We have produced many important products and components for these units.

For ten years, we have fought tenaciously against the revisionist line of science and technology. We are all people who have suffered in the old society. We joined the scientific practice struggle with deep feelings for Chairman Mao and the Party, with a strong desire to change the backward state of our country, and with a firm determination to fight for the proletariat of socialist China. However, the capitalist-roaders in the factory, seeing us doing scientific experiments, said maliciously, "If you succeed, you get a little money; if you fail, who do you ask for money?" Money, money, money, that's all they think about! They did not give us money, time, or equipment, and they tried every means to suppress us. Under these circumstances, we could only sneak around and work in the evenings during our spare time. The capitalist-roaders looked down on us workers and brought in a capitalist from outside to do scientific experiments. They praised this stinking capitalist as an "expert." Although this fellow worked only one or two hours a day, he was given 120 yuan per month for "travel expenses." This "expert" accomplished nothing and finally ran away.

Vice Chairman Lin said, "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force and an invincible spiritual atom bomb." Our cultural level is very low; we have only attended four or five years of primary school. We created new technologies entirely relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. When we started doing scientific experiments, we did not even understand what current, voltage, cathode, and anode were, and we knew nothing about chemical reactions or physical phenomena. However, Chairman Mao taught us, "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is more important learning." Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, we have not only understood current, voltage, cathode, and anode and mastered their relationships in ten years of scientific practice struggles, but we have also learned a lot of electrochemistry knowledge that is not in books. We have solved countless problems in practical struggles. Whenever we encounter difficulties, the image of "Old Qufu" flashes in our minds. Some experiments failed more than 500 times before succeeding. When we encounter technical problems, we study Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" to guide our scientific experiments. In this way, many problems are solved, and the development of new technologies is promoted.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee monopolized the party, government, and scientific and technological powers, blocking from above and suppressing from below. They have always ignored the new technology created by workers. Later, under the pretext of "examination," they suppressed our creations. The former Beijing Municipal Committee and the capitalist-roaders in our factory colluded, not allowing the workers who personally created this technology to participate in the "examination," but instead inviting a bourgeois "authority" from the Chinese Academy of Sciences to "examine" it. This "authority" said that "it is nothing special for a printing worker to create this new technology"; "if it can be processed on a certain metal, then it can be considered a creation." This metal processing, which they themselves failed to do after several years, was used to make things difficult for us and to deny the creations of the working class. Why can't the new technology created by workers be considered a creation? This is simply outrageous! The Chinese working class, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, can create miracles. What the foreign "experts" can do, we can do the same; what the foreign "experts" dare not do, we can do it!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further inspired our creative enthusiasm. We have made several major innovations to the new technology and, with practical actions, refuted the fallacies of the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements within the Party led by China's Khrushchev and the reactionary academic "authorities." The scientific and technological front must be occupied by the working class! We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forge ahead, and scale the peaks of world science and technology, welcoming the new wave of technological revolution that is about to arrive.

    工人阶级是创造革新的主人
    首都灭资兴无制版厂工人　张继明　杜向东
    伟大领袖毛主席最近连续发出伟大指示：
  “走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”。每个指示发表之后，我们激动的心情总是久久不能平静下来。
    毛主席教导说：“人民群众有无限的创造力”，“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。毛主席历来教导我们，要依靠工农群众和能够同工农结合的知识分子，来发展我国的科技事业。
    中国赫鲁晓夫同毛主席的教导大唱反调，鼓吹要依靠一小撮走资派和资产阶级“权威”。他胡说什么，建设社会主义要“特别是依靠厂长、工程师和技师”；“我们国家的进步要依靠科学家的努力，尤其是要老科学家带头”，竭力推行反革命修正主义的“专家路线”。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，对我们工人阶级在生产斗争和科学实验中的创造、革新，竭力压制、打击和贬低。现在我们用亲身的经历，来控诉和批判反革命修正主义科技路线对我们的迫害。
    我们是学徒工出身的制版工人。一九五八年，我们在毛主席发出的自力更生、奋发图强的伟大指示下，在三面红旗的光辉照耀下，树雄心、立壮志，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的精神，在没有任何技术资料、没有伸手向国家要一文钱的条件下，依靠了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，用土办法创造了一项我国还没有的新工艺，为我国试制半导体晶体管创造了条件，同时，还试制成功了过去依靠进口的、电子显微镜用的金属网。
    一九六一年，我们国家要生产一种重要仪器，这种仪器过去依靠进口。制造这种仪器需要一种精密刻度玻璃。某厂技术人员按照外国技术资料和书本知识，搞了半年多没搞成，后来把一大堆洋书抱到我们工厂来，要我们按照外国资料替他们试制这种精密刻度玻璃。我们用放大镜一看，这种刻度玻璃并不“神秘”，我们完全可以制造。我们就说：“洋玩艺我们不懂，洋文不认识，我们用中国土办法，给你们试制，半个月后来拿样品！”他们半信半疑地走出了工厂。
    半个月之后，拿我们制的刻度玻璃和外国货一比，成本少，设备土，工艺简便，便于推广，给了那些迷信洋人的人们当头一棒！
    经过十年来的实践证明，我们用土办法创造成功的新工艺，是发展电子工业的关键工艺之一，引起了全国电子工业生产和研究单位的重视。我们为这些单位生产了不少重要产品和器件。
    十年来，我们同修正主义的科技路线，进行了顽强的斗争。我们都是在旧社会受过苦的人。我们是怀着对毛主席、对党的无产阶级深厚感情，怀着改变我国一穷二白状况的强烈愿望，怀着为社会主义中国的无产阶级争气的坚强决心，投入科学实践斗争中去的。可是，厂内走资派看到我们搞科学实验，就恶狠狠地说：“搞成了收一点钱，搞不成向谁要钱呀！”钱，钱，钱，资产阶级脑袋瓜里就是钱！他们对待我们是一不给钱，二不给时间，三不给设备，千方百计地压制。在这种情况下，我们只能偷偷摸摸地在晚上业余时间干。走资派瞧不起我们工人，从厂外找了一个资本家来搞科学实验。他把这个臭资本家吹捧为“专家”。尽管这个家伙一天只工作一二个小时，却每月给他一百二十元“车马费”。这个“专家”一事无成，最后溜掉了。
    林副主席说：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”我们文化水平很低，只上过四五年小学。我们创造新工艺全凭战无不胜的毛泽东思想。开始搞科学实验时，我们连什么是电流、电压、阴极、阳极也不懂，对一些化学反应、物理现象更是一门不通。但是，毛主席教导说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”靠毛泽东思想指明方向，我们在十年的科学实践斗争中，不但懂得了电流、电压、阴极、阳极，掌握了它们之间的关系，而且学到了许多书本上没有的电化学知识，在实践斗争中解决了无数个难题。每当困难的时候，我们脑子里就闪出了“老愚公”的形象。有些试验连续失败五百次以上才获得成功。在技术上遇见难题，我们就学习毛主席的《矛盾论》《实践论》，来指导我们的科学实验。这样，许多问题就迎刃而解，推动了新工艺的不断发展。
    毛主席教导说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团霸占着党政和科技大权，对上封锁，对下镇压。对我们工人创造的新工艺，他们一直不加理睬。后来，又假借“审查”的名义，对我们的创造进行扼杀。旧北京市委和我厂走资派串通一气，不让我们亲手创造这个工艺的工人参加这次“审查”，反而向科学院某研究所请了一位资产阶级“权威”来“审查”。这个“权威”胡说什么“制版工人搞成这个新工艺没有什么了不起”；“如果现在能在某种金属上加工的话，那么可以算创造。”这种金属加工，他们自己搞了几年没搞成，想借此机会刁难我们，并且抹杀我们工人阶级的创造。为什么工人创造的新工艺就不能算创造呢？真是岂有此理！我们在毛泽东思想哺育下的中国工人阶级，能够创造出人间奇迹来。洋人“专家”能干的我们照样能干，洋人“专家”不敢干的，我们也能干出来！就在那位资产阶级“权威”给我们出难题以后几天，在某种金属上加工的“难题”，就在我们工人手里胜利地解决了。
    无产阶级文化大革命，更加鼓舞了我们的创造热情。我们对新工艺又进行了几次重大革新，以实际行动反击了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子和反动学术“权威”的谬论。科学技术阵地必须由工人阶级来占领！我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进，攀登世界科学技术高峰，迎接即将到来的技术革命的新高潮。
