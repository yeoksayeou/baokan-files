Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On Practice" and "Combat Liberalism" have recently been translated into Basque and published in the Basque region of Western Europe. They have been warmly welcomed by the local people.

A Basque friend joyfully said: "The publication of Chairman Mao's works in Basque is a major event in our history. This is the first time Chairman Mao's works have been published in our language. These works are also the first batch of Marxist-Leninist documents translated into Basque. Previously, only Spanish or French Marxist-Leninist works could be found here. We welcome the publication of Chairman Mao's works in our own language, making it easier for our people to read. Today, for the smooth progress of our liberation cause, Chairman Mao's works are of special importance to us."

A Basque worker emphasized that Chairman Mao's works are the source of power for the Basque people in their struggle against imperialism and fascism.

The Basque region is located on the Atlantic coast of the western Pyrenees between Spain and France. The Basque people live in this region. It is now divided into two parts, belonging to Spain and France, respectively.

    毛主席光辉著作在巴斯克地区出版
    受到当地广大人民群众的热烈欢迎
    新华社五日讯　伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》和《反对自由主义》，最近在西欧的巴斯克地区译成巴斯克文出版，受到当地广大人民群众的热烈欢迎。
    一位巴斯克朋友高兴地说：“毛主席著作巴斯克文版的出版，是我们历史上的重大事件。用我们的语文出版毛主席的著作，这是第一次。这些著作也是第一批翻译成巴斯克文的马克思列宁主义文献。过去在这里只能找到西班牙文或法文的马克思列宁主义著作。我们欢呼毛主席著作用我们自己的语文出版，这样，我们的人民就更容易阅读了。今天，为了顺利进行我们的解放事业，毛主席的著作对我们来说有特别重要的意义。”
    一位巴斯克工人强调指出，毛主席著作是巴斯克人民进行反对帝国主义和反对法西斯主义斗争的动力的源泉。
    巴斯克是位于西班牙和法国之间的比利牛斯山西部大西洋沿岸的一个地区，巴斯克人在这一地区居住。它现在被分为两部分，分属于西班牙和法国。
