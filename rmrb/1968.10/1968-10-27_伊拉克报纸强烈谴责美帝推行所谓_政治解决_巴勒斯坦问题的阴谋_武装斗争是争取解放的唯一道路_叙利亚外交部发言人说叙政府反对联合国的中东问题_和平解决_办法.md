Iraqi newspapers have strongly condemned the U.S. imperialist decision to provide "Phantom" aircraft to Israel and its plot to push for a so-called "political solution" to the Palestinian issue within the United Nations. The newspapers emphasized that armed struggle is the only path for the Arab people.

The recently published *Al-Ahrar* newspaper on the 23rd in an article condemning the U.S. imperialist preparation to provide "Phantom" aircraft to the Israeli aggressors clearly stated that the broad masses of the Arab people are not afraid of "Phantom" aircraft, nor are they afraid of the U.S. fleet and any threats from imperialism.

The article highly praised the "Fatah" (Palestinian National Liberation Movement) and other Palestinian commando organizations for their brilliant victories in armed struggle against Zionist Israelis.

The article pointed out that armed struggle is the only path to defeat the Israeli invaders. Our Arab nation's struggle, which does not fear sacrifice, will surely achieve victory.

*Al-Thawra* newspaper on the 21st published a commentary saying: "The solution to the Palestinian issue will not be placed on a plate by the United Nations and served to us. The solution to the Palestinian issue is clear and known to all—this is the path of struggle, the path of armed struggle until victory is achieved."

According to a report from New China News Agency in Damascus on the 23rd, a spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry stated on the 22nd that the Syrian government firmly opposes all "peaceful resolution" methods proposed by the United Nations for the Middle East issue, and the Syrian government and the Arab people are determined to engage in armed struggle.

The spokesman said: "The Syrian representative to the United Nations has been given clear and strict instructions to propose revolutionary principles and fundamental views on the issue of imperialist Zionist aggression and the Palestinian cause, to affirm our resolute rejection of all peaceful surrender solutions, to resolutely reject all international compromise measures that are being drafted, to expose the imperialist Zionist plot to eliminate the Palestinian cause, and to show the Syrian government and the Arab masses' determination to engage in armed struggle. Armed struggle is the path chosen by the people of invaded countries to defend their independence and survival."

The spokesman called on the Arab people to maintain the highest level of revolutionary vigilance and be prepared to "foil the imperialist Zionist plot to sabotage the Palestinian cause and sabotage our Arab nation's survival and future."

    据新华社巴格达二十三日电　伊拉克报纸强烈谴责美帝国主义决定向以色列提供“鬼怪式”飞机以及在联合国组织内推行所谓“政治解决”巴勒斯坦问题的阴谋。报纸强调，武装斗争是阿拉伯人民的唯一道路。
    新出版的《自由报》二十三日在一篇谴责美帝国主义准备向以色列侵略者提供“鬼怪式”飞机的文章中明确表示，阿拉伯广大人民群众既不怕“鬼怪式”飞机，也不怕美国舰队和帝国主义的任何威胁。
    文章高度赞扬“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦民族解放运动）和其他巴勒斯坦突击队组织在对以色列犹太复国主义者进行武装斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    文章指出，武装斗争是击败以色列入侵者的唯一道路。我们阿拉伯民族不惜牺牲的战斗，必然会取得胜利。
    《革命报》二十一日发表评论说：“解决巴勒斯坦问题的办法，决不会放在联合国的盘子里送给我们。解决（巴勒斯坦问题）的道路是明确的，大家都知道的——这就是斗争的道路，就是进行武装斗争，直到取得胜利。”
    据新华社大马士革二十三日电　叙利亚外交部的一位发言人二十二日在这里发表谈话时强调指出，叙利亚政府断然反对联合国在中东问题上的一切“和平解决”办法，叙利亚政府和阿拉伯人民决心进行武装斗争。
    这位发言人说：“叙利亚驻联合国代表团已经得到明确严格的指示，要对帝国主义犹太复国主义侵略和在巴勒斯坦事业的问题上提出革命的原则和基本观点，肯定我们断然拒绝一切和平投降的解决办法，断然拒绝正在开始拟定的一切国际妥协办法，揭露帝国主义犹太复国主义取消巴勒斯坦事业的阴谋，表明叙利亚政府和阿拉伯群众进行武装斗争的决心。武装斗争是遭受侵略的各国人民为了保卫独立和生存而选择的道路。”
    发言人呼吁阿拉伯人民保持最高度的革命警惕和作好准备，以“挫败帝国主义犹太复国主义破坏巴勒斯坦事业、破坏我们阿拉伯民族的生存和前途的阴谋。”
