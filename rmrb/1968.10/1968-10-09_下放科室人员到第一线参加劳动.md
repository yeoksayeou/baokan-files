Tianjin's factories and enterprises are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions by sending office staff to the front lines to participate in labor. Over 1,700 factories and enterprises in the city have sent more than 70% of their office personnel to the production front lines. After arriving there, they actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, transform their worldviews, and persist in working, living, studying, and engaging in struggle, criticism, and transformation alongside the workers. This has significantly promoted the revolutionization of thought.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 8 — The revolutionary committees of Tianjin's factories and enterprises are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They are vigorously criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, streamlining organizations, and sending large numbers of cadres to the production front lines to participate in labor. This has significantly promoted the revolutionization of cadres' thoughts. Currently, more than 80% of the 1,700-plus factories and enterprises in the city have streamlined their organizations, and more than 70% of their office personnel have been sent to the production front lines. The broad masses of workers are satisfied and praise, "Cadres going to the workshops to work with us makes us think together, speak together, and work together. This is truly heart to heart."

After the revolutionary committees were established in Tianjin's factories and enterprises in March this year, they carried out extensive reforms of the old organizations, sending office personnel to the front lines. During this process, the revolutionary committees at all levels fully played the leading role of the working class, leading the revolutionary masses to expose, accuse, and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev and his agents promoted in the construction of political power. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of workers, revolutionary cadres, and technical personnel deeply understood that Chairman Mao's instructions on streamlining organizations and sending cadres to labor are the greatest care and love for cadres, and are fundamental measures to prevent revisionism. Seriously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions is of great significance for carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation, and for consolidating and developing the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some old cadres deeply felt, "One important reason for past mistakes was long-term detachment from labor and the masses, lacking the standpoint, thoughts, and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, thus becoming increasingly distant from the working class and increasingly close to revisionism." In streamlining organizations, the revolutionary committees at all levels generally transformed the old organizations into three groups: political, production, and logistics, changing the three-level management of factories and enterprises to two levels, and sending a large number of office workers to the production front lines. This made the revolutionary committees at all levels have small organizations, fewer detached personnel, close ties with the masses, and vigorous revolutionary spirit. Tianjin Steel Plant previously had over 1,100 cadres, with a large organization and redundant personnel. Recently, 87% of the cadres were sent to the production front lines to work and study with the workers, and to engage in struggle, criticism, and transformation together. This made the office revolutionary, significantly improved work efficiency, and powerfully promoted the development of production.

In streamlining organizations and sending cadres to labor, the revolutionary committees of various factories and enterprises emphasized proletarian politics, focused on active thoughts, and vigorously promoted the revolutionization of cadres' thoughts. Some intellectual cadres said, "Ten years of hard study, wearing work clothes, if I had known to be a worker, why bother to study." The factory revolutionary committees addressed these active thoughts by holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using "criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, and educating them on class struggle and line struggle. In the study classes, many cadres deeply studied the "Old Three Articles," invited old workers to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, raised their political awareness, and decided to take the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some cadres had the thought of "difficult to go down, difficult to stay up," but after repeatedly studying the "Old Three Articles," they decided to follow Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, humbly learn from the worker masses, accept the worker masses' re-education, be an ordinary laborer for life, and transform their thoughts for life.

After the broad cadres were sent to the production front lines, they actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, transformed their worldviews, and persisted in working, living, studying, and engaging in struggle, criticism, and transformation with the workers. Their spiritual outlook has significantly changed. Through working with the workers, they more deeply understood that the working class listens to Chairman Mao the most, is the most loyal to Chairman Mao, and studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought the best. They took the workers as their teachers, willingly being students, with the "official air" gone and no "decayed air," with firm revolutionary will, and strengthened the style of closely tying with the masses. Many cadres deeply felt, "Working with the workers, our bodies are close to the workers, our sweat flows together, and our hearts are connected. The more we work, the deeper our feelings for the workers, and the more thorough our thought transformation."

The new and old cadres in the revolutionary committees at all levels, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an official and a common person," also went to the workshops in batches to participate in labor. The members of the revolutionary committees at all levels, except for a few who stayed to handle daily work, all went to the production front lines to participate in labor, working with the workers to grasp revolution and promote production. The broad new cadres insisted on working in their original production positions, placing themselves under the supervision of the worker masses, further strengthening their ties with the masses. Tianjin Hemp Textile Mill's 140 cadres, most of whom have been sent to the production front lines. The 14 revolutionary committee members, except for those who stayed to handle daily work, all went to the workshops and teams to participate in labor, uniting in thought and feeling with the workers, powerfully promoting revolution and production. This mill completed its annual production plan last year and has since surpassed its production plan every month this year.

    天津工厂企业坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示
    下放科室人员到第一线参加劳动
    市区一千七百多个工厂企业，下放了百分之七十以上的科室干部，他们到生产第一线后，活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观，坚持和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同搞斗、批、改，有力地促进了思想革命化
    新华社天津八日电　天津市工厂企业的各级革命委员会，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，精简机构，下放大批干部到生产第一线参加劳动，有力地促进了干部的思想革命化。目前，市区的一千七百多个工厂企业，百分之八十以上精简了机构，下放了百分之七十以上的科室人员。广大工人群众满意地称赞说：“干部下放到车间和我们一起劳动，这样就和我们心往一处想，话往一处说，劲往一处使，这才是真正心连心。”
    今年三月，天津市工厂企业普遍建立革命委员会之后，都对旧机构进行了大刀阔斧的改革，下放了科室人员。在进行这一工作的过程中，各级革命委员会充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，率领广大革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，进行了揭发、控诉和批判。通过革命的大批判，广大工人群众、革命干部和技术人员深刻地认识到，毛主席关于精简机构和干部下放劳动的指示，是对干部的最大关怀和最大爱护，是反修、防修的根本措施。认真落实毛主席的指示，对搞好斗、批、改，巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，具有十分重大的意义。有的老干部深有感触地说：“过去犯错误的一个重要原因，就是长期脱离劳动，脱离群众，缺乏工农兵群众的立场、思想、感情，因此越来和工人阶级的感情越远，越来离修正主义越近。”在精简机构中，各级革命委员会普遍地把原来的旧机构改为政治、生产和后勤三个组，把工厂企业过去的三级管理改为两级管理，下放了大批科室工作人员到生产第一线，使各级革命委员会作到了机构小，脱产人员少，密切联系群众，革命朝气蓬勃。天津钢厂过去有一千一百多名干部，机构庞大，人浮于事，最近下放了百分之八十七的干部到生产第一线，同工人一起劳动，一起学习，一起搞斗、批、改，使机关革命化，工作效率大大提高，有力地促进了生产的发展。
    在精简机构和干部下放劳动中，各工厂企业的革命委员会突出无产阶级政治，大抓活思想，狠抓干部的思想革命化。有些知识分子干部说：“十年寒窗苦，穿上工作服，早知当工人，何必去读书。”工厂革委会针对这种活思想，举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，对他们进行了阶级斗争和路线斗争的教育。在学习班里，许多干部大学“老三篇”，请老工人忆苦思甜，提高了政治觉悟，决心走与工农兵相结合的道路。有的干部有“下去难看，留下难办”的思想，经过反复学习“老三篇”，决心听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，虚心向工人群众学习，接受工人群众的再教育，当一辈子普通劳动者，改造一辈子思想。
    广大干部下放到生产第一线以后，活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观，坚持和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同搞斗、批、改，精神面貌发生了显著的变化。他们通过和工人一起劳动，更深刻地认识到工人阶级最听毛主席的话，对毛主席最忠，活学活用毛泽东思想最好。他们拜工人为师，甘当小学生，“官气”打掉了，“暮气”没有了，革命意志坚定了，密切联系群众的作风增强了。很多干部深有体会地说：“和工人一起劳动，身子和工人贴在一起，汗流在一起，心连在一起。越劳动和工人感情越深，越劳动思想改造就越彻底。”
    各级革命委员会中的在职新老干部，遵照毛主席关于“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，也分批到车间参加劳动。各级革命委员会的成员除留极少数人值班处理日常工作外，其他成员和工作人员，都到生产第一线参加劳动，同工人们一起抓革命、促生产。广大新干部坚持在原来的生产岗位上劳动，把自己置于工人群众的监督之下，进一步密切了和群众的关系。天津麻纺厂的一百四十名干部，大多数已下放到生产第一线。厂革委会的十四名新老干部，除留下值班人员处理日常工作外，全部到车间班组参加劳动，在思想感情上和工人打成一片，有力地推动了革命和生产。这个厂去年完成全年生产计划之后，今年以来又月月超额完成了生产计划。
