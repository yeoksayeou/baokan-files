The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Second Hospital of Zhuozhou City, Hunan Province, holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the medical staff of the obstetrics and gynecology department to break through the Western framework and perform surgery in the delivery room to save the lives of class sisters in urgent situations. Local revolutionary masses praise: The leadership of the working class is great!

Lower-middle peasant Tan Shuyuan, a member of Dongfeng Commune, Zhuozhou County, was sent to the Second Hospital of Zhuozhou City by her husband Tang Fayu due to difficult childbirth and excessive bleeding. At that time, Tang Fayu did not bring any cash, only a letter of introduction from the commune. The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the hospital opposed the regulations set by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party that prohibited admission without cash and decided to admit Tan Shuyuan immediately to save her life.

On the morning of September 14, Tan Shuyuan suddenly started bleeding heavily. Despite the use of pressure infusion, the blood loss was still far from being compensated. After an examination in the delivery room, it was diagnosed that Tan Shuyuan had a central placenta previa. Due to excessive blood loss, her lips and fingernails turned black, her body was covered in cold sweat, and her blood pressure kept dropping. Tan Shuyuan was in a state of shock. At this critical moment, the only way to save her was to perform a cesarean section while treating for shock. Although the operating room was only about a hundred meters away from the delivery room, it was impossible to move Tan Shuyuan, who was in shock, to the operating room because she could not endure any jolting, which might cause her death. However, the surgery had to be performed immediately! The medical staff were at their wits' end, not knowing what to do.

At this critical juncture, the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "We need a passionate but calm mood, a tense but orderly work." "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution." They decided to overcome all difficulties and save the class sister! Break through the Western framework, perform the surgery in the delivery room without going to the operating room.

The workers' propaganda team illuminated the hearts of the medical staff with Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, a tense battle began! The medical staff in the operating room studied Chairman Mao's teachings: save the dying and help the injured, practice revolutionary humanitarianism. A deep class sentiment to save the class sister stirred them. Break! It must be broken! Therefore, they quickly transported the instruments and supplies to the delivery room. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the medical staff performed surgery on Tan Shuyuan and delivered the fetus. However, the fetus had no breathing and was purple all over. After more than twenty minutes of intense rescue, the fetus took its first breath. At this time, Tan Shuyuan's bleeding stopped, her blood pressure began to rise, and her lips gradually turned from purple to red.

Tan Shuyuan and her child were saved. The delivery room was filled with joy. People shouted in unison: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand years! Tan Shuyuan said, it was the great leader Chairman Mao who gave her a second life. To express her boundless loyalty and gratitude to Chairman Mao, Tang Fayu and his wife named the child "San Zhong."

Through this battle to save the class sister, the medical staff received great education. They said, the success of performing surgery on Tan Shuyuan in the delivery room is a severe blow to the reactionary academic "authority" of the bourgeoisie! The medical staff repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply understanding that the working class must lead everything and can lead everything. They expressed that intellectuals must honestly accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers to walk the path of revolutionization.

    工人毛泽东思想宣传队就是好
    驻株洲市第二医院工人宣传队领导医务人员打破洋框框抢救阶级姐妹
    进驻湖南省株洲市第二医院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，领导这个医院妇产科的医务人员大破洋框框，在紧急需要的情况下，不进手术室，在产房给产妇动手术，抢救了谭淑元母子的生命。当地的广大革命群众赞扬说，工人阶级领导一切就是好！
    下中农谭淑元是株洲县东风公社的社员，因难产并且流血过多，由她的爱人唐发元将她送到株洲市第二医院。当时，唐发元没带现金，只有公社开的一封介绍信。进驻这个医院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，同党内一小撮走资派过去制定的没有现金不能住院的规章制度针锋相对，从抢救阶级姐妹的生命出发，当即决定收留谭淑元住院。
    九月十四日上午，谭淑元突然大量流血。尽管输液筒在加压输血，但是还是远远补偿不了大量的失血。经过产房检查，确诊谭淑元为中央性前置胎盘。由于失血过多，她的嘴唇和指甲全发乌了，全身冷汗淋漓，血压一降再降，谭淑元完全处于休克状态了。在这生命危急的关键时刻，唯一的抢救办法就是在抗休克治疗的同时，进行剖腹手术。手术室距离产房虽然只有一百来米远，可是不能把处于休克状态的谭淑元送往手术室；因为她经不起一点颠簸，颠簸就可能死亡。而手术又必须立即进行！医务人员急得团团转，不知如何是好。
    在这千钧一发之际，工人毛泽东思想宣传队组织大家学习毛主席的教导：“我们需要的是热烈而镇定的情绪，紧张而有秩序的工作。”“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”并当即决定，克服一切困难，抢救阶级姐妹！打破洋框框，不进手术室，就地动手术。
    工人宣传队用毛泽东思想把医务人员的心照亮了。于是，一场紧张的战斗开始了！手术室的医务人员学习了毛主席的教导：救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义。一种强烈的抢救阶级姐妹的深厚阶级感情，在激励着她们。破！非破不可！于是她们在很短时间内，将器械物品跑步送到产房。医务人员们在毛泽东思想指引下给谭淑元动了手术，娩出了胎儿。可是胎儿没有呼吸，全身发紫。经过二十多分钟的紧张抢救，胎儿出现了第一次呼吸。这时，谭淑元的流血也止了，她的血压开始上升，嘴唇渐渐由紫变红。
    谭淑元母子得救了。产房内外，一片欢腾。人们齐声欢呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！谭淑元说，是伟大领袖毛主席给了她第二次生命。为了表达对毛主席的无限忠心和感激，唐发元夫妇给小孩取名“三忠”。
    通过这一场抢救阶级姐妹的战斗，医务人员受到了很大的教育。他们说，给谭淑元破格在产房动手术的成功，这是给资产阶级反动学术“权威”一次狠狠的打击！医务人员反复学习毛主席的最新指示，深刻体会到：工人阶级必须领导一切，而且也能够领导一切。他们表示，知识分子只有老老实实接受工农兵的再教育，才能走上革命化的道路。　（据新华社）
