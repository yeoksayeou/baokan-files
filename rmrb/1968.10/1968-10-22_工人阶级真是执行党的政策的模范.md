	The working class is truly a model in implementing the Party's policies.  The sixteen students from the Shandong Changwei Medical College, including Han Changqing, are about to graduate and leave school. The comrades from the Workers' Propaganda Team are preparing to hold a farewell meeting for them. When this news spread, someone grumbled, "For people like them, why hold a farewell meeting? Just let them go!"

	This remark caught the attention of the Workers' Propaganda Team.

	When it comes to Han Changqing and his classmates, every revolutionary teacher and student in the entire school knows them. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," bravely rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and made some contributions. However, in the later stages of the movement, due to selfish thoughts, they fell for the tricks of the class enemies, deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, said some wrong things, and did some wrong things.

	After the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team arrived at Changwei Medical College, they followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party." They correctly handled these young rebels who had made mistakes, affirmed their meritorious deeds in the early and middle stages of the Cultural Revolution, and were determined to educate them to correct their mistakes and continue to advance. Old worker Liu Ruiyun said, "The working class listens to Chairman Mao the most. We must strictly implement the Party's policies." He personally went among the revolutionary teachers and students to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, patiently doing ideological and political work.

	The date of departure was getting closer, and Han Changqing was always anxious. However, on the day of the meeting, he was taken aback. At the meeting, the representative of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team spoke, affirming their merits in the early and middle stages of the Cultural Revolution, and enthusiastically encouraging them to make new contributions for the people at their new posts. The Workers' Propaganda Team and all the revolutionary teachers and students in the school also presented them with the most precious gifts: Chairman Mao's badge and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and pinned a big red flower on each of their chests. Classmates also continuously shouted slogans, warmly sending them off. At this moment, Han Changqing could no longer hold back his tears. He rushed onto the stage, tears streaming down his face, and said excitedly, "I will sincerely learn from the working class, thoroughly reform my worldview, accept the lessons of my past mistakes, and follow Chairman Mao to do revolution for life!" He repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

	This incident deeply educated all the revolutionary teachers and students in the school. Everyone was very moved, and even those who originally disagreed with holding the farewell meeting said, "The working class is truly a model in implementing the Party's policies."

    工人阶级真是执行党的政策的模范
    山东昌潍医学院革命小将韩长清等十六人就要毕业离校了。工人宣传队的同志们准备开大会欢送他们。这个消息一传开，就有人没好气地说：“象他们这样的人，还开什么欢送大会，走了算了！”这话引起了工人宣传队的重视。
    提起韩长清等同学，全院革命师生没有一个不知道。无产阶级文化大革命一开始，他们高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，勇敢地造了党内一小撮走资派的反，做出了一定的贡献。但在运动后期，由于私心杂念作怪，他们上了阶级敌人的当，背离了毛主席的革命路线，说了些错话，做了些错事。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队到了昌潍医学院以后，遵循毛主席“政策和策略是党的生命”的教导，正确对待这些犯错误的小将，肯定他们在文化大革命初期和中期立下的丰功伟绩，决心教育他们改正错误，继续前进。老工人刘瑞云说：“工人阶级最听毛主席的话，我们一定要严格执行党的政策。”他亲自到革命师生中间去，宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，耐心地做思想政治工作。
    离校的日期越来越近了，韩长清心里总是惴惴不安。但是，开会那天，却使他出乎意料之外。会上，工人毛泽东思想宣传队代表讲了话，肯定了他们在文化大革命初期、中期创建的功勋，热情地鼓励他们在新的战斗岗位上，为人民立新功。工人宣传队和全院革命师生还向他们赠送了最珍贵的礼物：毛主席像章和《毛主席语录》，并给每人胸前戴上了一朵大红花。同学们也不断地高呼口号，热烈欢送他们。这时，韩长清再也憋不住了，他几步跳上台去，热泪盈眶，万分激动地说：“我一定老老实实地向工人阶级学习，彻底改造自己的世界观，接受以前犯错误的教训，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命！”他一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    这件事深深教育了全院广大革命师生。大家都很感动，连原来少数不同意召开欢送会的人都说：“工人阶级真是执行党的政策的模范。”
