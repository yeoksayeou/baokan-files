	La Paz, October 29 (New China News Agency) – The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bolivian Communist Party recently issued a statement denouncing the brutal plunder and exploitation of the people by U.S. imperialism and the Bolivian bureaucratic bourgeoisie. The statement strongly condemns the barbaric rule of the pro-U.S. fascist regime of Barrientos and reaffirms that the Bolivian people can only achieve liberation from the shackles of U.S. imperialism and domestic reactionaries by taking up armed struggle and seizing power.

	The statement was issued to commemorate the large-scale anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship struggle launched by the workers of the important tin mines of Catavi and Siglo XX in June 1967.

	The statement angrily denounces the bloody massacre of the miners last June by the pro-U.S. dictatorship of Barrientos, with the support of the U.S. military mission and the Central Intelligence Agency. It points out that U.S. imperialist aggression is the root cause of the Bolivian people's poverty, unemployment, and lack of freedom. The Barrientos dictatorship unconditionally serves U.S. imperialism and domestic reactionary forces, implementing policies dictated by imperialist monopolies and reactionary forces, plunging the Bolivian people into extreme poverty and depriving them of their most basic rights and freedoms.

	The statement lists facts showing that foreign monopolies, through their own companies or through their control of Bolivian state-owned enterprises, annually siphon off $235 million in profits from Bolivia. If the profits extorted through the control of raw material prices are added, they annually siphon off nearly $400 million, meaning they siphon off more than $1 million a day. This is the "aid" of U.S. imperialism to the Bolivian people! Meanwhile, the bureaucrats of the Bolivian dictatorship use every possible illegal means to embezzle $97 million from the national treasury from November 4, 1964, to December 31, 1967. They control some subsidiary industries of foreign monopolies and some new agricultural companies in Santa Cruz and other provinces.

	The statement emphasizes: "To eliminate poverty, hunger, and suffering, it is necessary to eliminate foreign monopolies and the bureaucrats of the military-bourgeoisie as soon as possible, so that the wealth and destiny of the nation are in the hands of the people. This is the current goal of all revolutionary forces."

	The statement lists a series of bloody crimes committed by the reactionary army against the Bolivian people since the Barrientos dictatorship came to power on November 4, 1964. It exposes the dictatorship's establishment of many concentration camps nationwide, intensifying political persecution, and the imprisonment of large numbers of workers, peasants, students, and patriots. The statement points out that the Bolivian reactionary army is a tool used by foreign monopolies and the ruling class to massacre the Bolivian working people.

	The statement points out that it is necessary to "destroy the reactionary army and, based on workers, peasants, and revolutionaries, establish a revolutionary people's army. This army will serve the people and thoroughly destroy the power of monopolies and reactionary forces."

	The statement points out: "The dictatorship is desperately trying to create chaos among the people, attempting to portray revolutionary forces as those negotiating with the fascist right. This is the most falsehood, because revolutionary forces understand that any approach to right-wing forces, regardless of nature, benefits the bourgeoisie and imperialism and harms the interests of the working class." The statement says: "When the bourgeoisie collaborates with imperialism to seize power, the people will never solve their own problems. On the contrary, if the working class leads all revolutionary classes and forces to establish a democratic, people's, and anti-imperialist government, it will end the current situation of poverty, unemployment, and lack of freedom suffered by the Bolivian people." The statement says: "The Bolivian Communist Party believes that workers, peasants, and the impoverished classes within the country, who are directly subjected to the exploitation and tyranny of the ruling class colluding with imperialism, have no other way but to prepare their own strength to seize power under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Revolutionary People's Front, and the Revolutionary People's Army. Only after seizing power can the working class and the people establish a just society and permanently bury the exploiters represented by the bourgeoisie, imperialism, and all reactionaries."

	The statement emphasizes: "Under the current specific historical conditions in Bolivia, if one does not take the road of armed struggle for the people to seize power, and talks about other roads, one has fallen into the shameful pit of betrayal. Only by taking up armed struggle can one destroy the government and its supporters, the imperialist military repression machine. Talking about peaceful or electoral roads is to serve the bourgeoisie and imperialism, which seek to permanently seize power." The statement concludes: "The road of armed struggle indicated by the victory of the people's war is the only way to break the current situation and achieve liberation. We should take up arms to overthrow the reactionary regime, and we should build a new society."

    玻共中央政治委员会揭露美帝和玻利维亚法西斯政权残酷压迫剥削人民
    只有开展武装斗争夺取政权才能获得解放
    新华社二十九日讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党中央委员会政治委员会不久前发表声明，揭露美帝国主义和玻利维亚官僚资产阶级对人民的残酷掠夺和剥削，强烈谴责巴里恩托斯亲美法西斯政权的残暴统治，重申玻利维亚人民只有开展武装斗争，夺取政权，才能从美帝国主义和国内反动派的枷锁下取得解放。
    这项声明，是为纪念卡塔维、二十世纪等重要锡矿区的工人在一九六七年六月掀起的大规模反美反独裁斗争而发表的。
    声明愤怒地谴责了在美国军事使团和美国中央情报局的支持下，巴里恩托斯亲美独裁政权去年六月对奋起斗争的矿工进行的血腥大屠杀后指出，美帝国主义的侵略是玻利维亚人民贫困、失业、没有自由的根源。巴里恩托斯独裁政权无条件地为美帝国主义和国内反动势力效劳，执行了帝国主义垄断集团和反动势力所规定的政策，使玻利维亚人民处于极其贫困的境地，人民的最基本权利和自由都被剥夺。
    声明列举事实指出，外国垄断集团通过自己的公司或者通过它们对玻利维亚国营企业的控制，每年从玻利维亚攫取二亿三千五百万美元的利润。如果再加上外国垄断集团通过控制原料价格所榨取的利润，它们每年要从玻利维亚攫取将近四亿美元，这意味着每天攫取一百多万美元。这就是美帝国主义对玻利维亚人民的“援助”！与此同时，玻利维亚独裁政权的官僚尽可能地利用一切不合法的手段，从一九六四年十一月四日到一九六七年十二月三十一日从国库拿走了九千七百万美元。他们掌握着外国垄断资本的一些附属工业以及在圣克鲁斯和其他省份的一些新的农业公司。
    声明强调说：“要消灭贫困、饥饿和痛苦，就必须尽早消灭外国垄断资本和军人——资产阶级的官僚，使国家的财富和命运掌握在人民手中，这是一切革命力量的当前的目标。”
    声明列举了巴里恩托斯独裁政权从一九六四年十一月四日上台以来，反动军队对玻利维亚人民所犯下的一系列血腥罪行，揭露独裁政权在全国设有许多集中营，加紧政治迫害，大批的工人、农民、学生和爱国人士被无辜地关在监狱中。声明指出，玻利维亚反动军队是外国垄断资本和本国统治阶级用来屠杀玻利维亚劳动人民的工具。
    声明指出，必须“摧毁反动军队，以工人、农民、革命人士为基础，建立一支革命人民军队，这支军队将为人民服务，彻底地摧毁垄断资本和反动势力的政权。”
    声明指出：“独裁政权处心积虑地拚命想在人民中间制造混乱，企图把革命力量说成与法西斯右派谈判的人。这是最虚假不过的了，因为革命力量懂得，与右派力量的任何性质的接近，都有利于资产阶级和帝国主义，而有损于工人阶级的利益。”声明说：“当资产阶级伙同帝国主义掌握政权时，人民将永远解决不了自己的问题。相反，如果工人阶级带领各革命阶级和力量建立起一个民主的、人民的和反帝的政权，就将结束现在玻利维亚人民所遭受的贫困、失业和没有自由的状况。”声明说：“玻利维亚共产党认为，直接遭受与帝国主义勾结的统治阶级的剥削和暴政之害的工人、农民和国内贫困阶层，不可能有别的道路，只能准备自己的力量，以便在共产党、革命人民阵线和革命人民军队的带领下夺取政权。在夺取政权后，工人阶级和人民才能建立一个公正的社会，永远埋葬以资产阶级、帝国主义和一切反动派为代表的剥削者。”
    声明强调指出：在玻利维亚目前的具体历史条件下，如果不走人民力量夺取政权的武装斗争的道路，而谈论别的道路，就是陷入了背叛的可耻泥坑。“只有开展武装斗争，才能摧毁政府和它的支持者帝国主义的万恶的军事镇压机构。谈论和平或选举道路就是为企图永远霸占政权的资产阶级和帝国主义效劳。”声明最后说：“人民战争的胜利道路所指引的武装斗争，是摆脱现在局面取得解放的唯一道路。我们应该拿起武器推翻反动政权，我们应该建立一个新社会。”
