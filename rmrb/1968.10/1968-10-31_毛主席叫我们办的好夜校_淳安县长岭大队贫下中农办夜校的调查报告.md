The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Changling Brigade, Changling Commune, Chun'an County, have, for the past sixteen years, persisted in running night schools in accordance with the brilliant directives of the great leader Chairman Mao on educational revolution, firmly grasping the power of rural education.

After the great directive of Chairman Mao, "Peasants should take agriculture as their main task (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries), and also learn military affairs, politics, and culture. When conditions permit, collective-run small factories should also be set up, and the bourgeoisie should be criticized," was issued, they changed the night school into one that mainly studies the works of Chairman Mao and sings songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, closely combining political education, cultural learning, and cultural activities, making the night school an important battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and an important venue for mobilizing the masses.

The superiority of the new-type school is unparalleled.

Through long-term practice, the night school has shown more and more of its superiority.

First, teachers do not need remuneration, and students do not need to bear expenses. The night school teachers are poor and lower-middle peasants recommended by the masses who are willing to serve the people. They work together with the commune members during the day and teach classes in the evening without pay. They teach while learning, acting as both teachers and students. The night school strictly implements the policy of frugal management, using makeshift teaching materials and solving problems through self-reliance. Necessary book and miscellaneous fees and electricity bills are covered by the income earned from collective planting of economic crops such as sesame during holidays or early mornings, or by mobilizing the masses to collect firewood and gather wild resources (starch, fiber, medicinal materials, and oilseeds).

Second, there are no age or promotion/demotion restrictions, and it does not occupy labor time, allowing all poor and lower-middle peasants to attend school. The night school breaks through the constraints of the revisionist educational line, adopting various methods to facilitate the masses. The ages of the participants ranged from sixty-five at the beginning to thirty-two currently. The learning time is in the evening, and the curriculum is arranged flexibly. Less is learned during busy times, and more is learned during idle times. The school is closed during peak times, and it does not occupy labor time. It is possible to start attending school midway. This approach is deeply welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, and everyone wants to attend school, saying, "This is the good night school that Chairman Mao tells us to run."

Third, learn what you do, learn and use simultaneously, and see immediate results. The teaching content of the night school is arranged according to the needs of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. After the cleanup of class ranks began, classes on Chairman Mao's discussions on class struggle and a series of latest directives on struggle, criticism, and transformation were arranged, and performances such as "Never Forget Class Bitterness" were staged to conduct class education for the students. At the same time, the classroom was used as a battlefield for criticism, organizing students to face-to-face criticize and struggle against class enemies, effectively promoting the current struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The night school has achieved bountiful results.

(1) Using the night school as a classroom to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, carrying out the "three loyalties" activities, and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. The night school, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," strongly emphasizes proletarian politics, insists on actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and conducts teaching in conjunction with the actual situations of class struggle and production struggle, making it easy to teach and understand. The poor and lower-middle peasants welcome it very much. In May of this year, the night school first launched the "three loyalties" activities, trained cadres, and then universally carried out the activities in all production teams and every household in the entire brigade. Now, reporting in the morning and summarizing in the evening have become the norm, and good people and good deeds are emerging in large numbers.

(2) Using the night school as a battlefield to carry out revolutionary criticism, break old customs, and establish new ones. The night school, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "not breaking means not establishing," held dozens of criticism meetings, fiercely criticizing the black goods of Liu Shaoqi such as the theory of "class struggle extinction," "three selfs and one packaging," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and "work points as the commander," promoting the struggle against enemies. At the same time, it thoroughly criticized old ideas and old customs, established new revolutionary customs, and made the entire brigade's appearance completely renewed.

(3) Eliminating illiteracy and popularizing and raising rural culture. Over the past sixteen years, more than two hundred people have attended the night school, accounting for forty percent of the total population of the entire brigade. Ninety-four people have eliminated illiteracy, including one who now serves as a commune cadre, eight who serve as brigade and production team cadres, six who have joined the People's Liberation Army, and more than ten who understand pest control, seed treatment, and other general agricultural scientific knowledge. The team leader of the first team, Fang Chunsheng, has never been to school in his ancestral line. Since he entered the night school in 1952, he has reached the cultural level of a junior middle school through diligent study. The villagers call him "Mr. Difficult Characters" (difficult characters and new words are asked of him, and he knows most of them). The poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically praise, saying: "With the night school, there will be no illiterates, and the knowledge of junior high school and primary school will not be forgotten. This is the good school that Chairman Mao calls on us to set up."

Highly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, running the night school even better.

After the latest directive of Chairman Mao, "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," was conveyed to Changling Brigade, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were all elated, regarding it as the greatest trust and support from Chairman Mao to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and also as a new and higher requirement put forward by Chairman Mao to the poor and lower-middle peasants. After studying and discussing, they seriously summarized the experience of running the night school for the past sixteen years and decided to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, running the night school better and better.

### “毛主席叫我们办的好夜校”——淳安县长岭大队贫下中农办夜校的调查报告

    “毛主席叫我们办的好夜校”
    ——淳安县长岭大队贫下中农办夜校的调查报告
    淳安县长岭公社长岭大队的广大贫下中农，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的一系列光辉指示，十六年来一直坚持办夜校，牢牢掌管农村教育大权。
    毛主席的“农民以农为主（包括林、牧、副、渔），也要兼学军事、政治、文化，在有条件的时候也要由集体办些小工厂，也要批判资产阶级”的伟大指示传下来以后，他们把夜校改变为主要是大学毛主席著作、大唱毛主席语录歌，把政治教育、文化学习、文娱活动三者紧密结合在一起，使夜校成为宣传毛泽东思想的重要阵地，成为宣传群众、组织群众的重要场所。
    新型学校有无比的优越性
    经过长期的实践，夜校越来越显示出它的优越性。
    一，教师不要报酬，学生不需负担。夜校教师都是贫下中农推荐出来的肯为人民服务的农村知识青年。他们白天同社员一起参加集体生产劳动，晚上尽义务教课，不取报酬。他们一面教，一面学，既当先生，又当学生。夜校认真贯彻勤俭办校的方针，教学用具因陋就简，自力更生解决；必要的书杂费和电灯费，他们利用假日或早晚时间，发动群众砍柴、采摘四野（淀粉、纤维、药材、油料）或利用四边地集体种植芝麻等经济作物取得的收入解决。
    二，不受年龄和升留级限制，不占用劳动时间，贫下中农人人都可上学。夜校打破修正主义教育路线所规定的条条框框限制，采取种种方法便利群众。参加学习者的年龄，在创办初期最大的为六十五岁，目前为三十二岁，学习时间都在晚上，课程安排机动灵活，忙时少学，闲时多学，大忙放假，不占用劳动时间。可以中途上学。这样做，深受贫下中农欢迎，人人都愿上学，都说“这是毛主席叫我们办的好夜校”。
    三，做什么，学什么，学用一致，立竿见影。夜校的教学都是根据阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的需要来安排的。清理阶级队伍开始后，就安排学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述和有关斗、批、改的一系列最新指示，排演《不忘阶级苦》等节目，向学员进行阶级教育。同时把课堂当作大批判的战场，组织学员向阶级敌人进行面对面的批判斗争，有力地推动了当前的斗、批、改。
    夜校取得了丰硕成果
    （一）以夜校为课堂，活学活用毛泽东思想。开展“三忠于”活动，促进了人的思想革命化。夜校遵照毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，大力突出无产阶级政治，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，并联系阶级斗争、生产斗争实际进行教学，易教易懂，贫下中农十分欢迎。今年五月，夜校首先开展“三忠于”活动，培训骨干，然后在全大队各个生产队和每家每户普遍开展。现在，早请示、晚汇报，蔚然成风，好人好事层出不穷。
    （二）以夜校为阵地，开展革命大批判，破旧俗，立新风。夜校遵照毛主席“不破不立”的教导，召开了几十次批判大会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等黑货，推动了对敌斗争。同时大破了旧思想、旧习俗，大立了革命新风尚，使整个大队的面貌焕然一新。
    （三）扫除文盲，普及提高农村文化。十六年来，上过夜校的有二百余人，占全大队总人口的百分之四十。扫除文盲九十四人，其中现在担任公社干部的一人，担任大队、生产队干部的八人，参加解放军的六人，懂得治虫、处理种籽等一般农业科学知识的有十多人。一队队长方春生，祖祖辈辈没有进过学校，一九五二年进夜校以来，由于他认真学习，现在已达到初中文化程度，村里人称他“难字先生”（难字生字问他大都知道）。贫下中农热烈赞扬说：“有了夜学堂，不会出文盲，初中高小生，知识不会忘。这是毛主席号召我们办起来的好学堂。”
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把夜校办得更好
    毛主席的“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”最新指示传达到长岭大队后，广大贫下中农无不欢欣鼓舞，认为这是毛主席对贫下中农的最大信任和支持，也是对贫下中农提出的新的更高要求。他们经过学习和讨论，认真总结了十六年来办夜校的经验，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把夜校办得好上加好。
