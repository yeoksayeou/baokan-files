The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Linchang Brigade of Wanli People's Commune, Jin County, Liaoning Province, have, over the past two years, educated fifteen urban youth who have settled in their brigade by using the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. The following are a few small stories about how they educated the youth.

The Old Brigade Leader Treats the "Illness"

When the urban youth He Yuhua first came to the countryside, she had an "arthritis" that acted up every few days. When she got the illness while working in the fields, she would lie down and be unable to move. He Yuhua said that her illness was not suitable for laboring in the countryside and that she should return to Dalian to rest. However, He Yuhua did not return to Dalian. Now, her illness has long been cured, and she picks the heaviest work in labor, climbing mountains and valleys with ease. If asked who cured her illness, she would say, "It was our brigade leader."

The brigade leader is Lin Xichang. The first time he heard that He Yuhua was ill, he was very worried. Later, upon learning the details, he found that He Yuhua's "illness" was caused by the following: He Yuhua had always wanted to go to the countryside to enjoy the beautiful scenery of nature when she was in Dalian. However, upon arriving at the fourth brigade of Linchang, she regretted it. She felt that the mountain valley was dull and had no future, so she tried every means to find an excuse to return to Dalian.

The brigade leader learned of this and thought: He Yuhua is afraid of hardship and wants to return to the city to enjoy comfort, isn't this a deserter on the revolutionary road? From then on, the brigade leader and the poor and lower-middle peasants often had heart-to-heart talks with He Yuhua and studied Chairman Mao's works together. One day, He Yuhua fell "ill" again, and the brigade leader sat by her side, studying the "Three Articles" with her and telling her stories of revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the people's liberation cause. He Yuhua became more and more restless as she studied. She felt that she had let down the great leader Chairman Mao, let down the poor and lower-middle peasants, and let down the revolutionary martyrs. She decided to take root in the countryside and wage a fierce struggle against her selfish thoughts in the midst of the people. From then on, He Yuhua's "arthritis" never acted up again.

Zhou's Patched Clothes

The urban youth Zhou Lijun had a blue flowered dress that she had patched many times, which was her favorite to wear. There is a story behind this blue flowered dress!

When she first went to the countryside, Zhou's clothes would tear, and she neither wanted to mend them nor wear them. Once, her blue flowered dress tore, and she immediately changed into a new student uniform, throwing the torn dress into the corner of the wall and never touching it again.

A few days later, one evening, Zhou was chatting happily with her friends when she saw Poor Peasant Wang Grandma walking in with a piece of clothing. Grandma asked, "Whose clothes are these?" Zhou said, "Mine, how did they get into your hands, Grandma?" Grandma said, "I saw that you were always busy, so I took this piece of clothing home to wash and mend it." Zhou took a look and casually said, "Grandma, this piece of clothing has been discarded long ago." Wang Grandma heard this, thought for a long time, and then spoke heavily, "Child, in the old society, we poor people couldn't afford to wear such clothes! You all have a good life now, but you must not forget your roots!"

That night, Zhou tossed and turned, unable to sleep. "You must not forget your roots!" Grandma's words echoed in her ears. She thought of her father's tragic scene of working barefoot in the snow for the capitalist in the old society and felt ashamed. She studied Chairman Mao's works over and over again, realizing that casually "discarding" the sweat and blood of the working people is to lose the character of the working people; Wang Grandma mended not only the holes in the clothes but also blocked the door of my bourgeois thoughts.

From then on, Zhou wore clothes with patches.

Lin Grandma's Heartfelt Words

Lin Grandma, who has deep hatred and bitterness, heard that Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, advocated the fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious" and "the poor welcome exploitation," and she was truly furious. At a criticism meeting, she saw that the firepower of these young people was not strong, and she was puzzled. However, upon careful consideration, she felt that this was not their fault. They had just come out of school, had been poisoned by the revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, and had been educated by bourgeois intellectuals, so how could they understand the depth of the poor and lower-middle peasants' class bitterness! Thinking of this, Lin Grandma wanted to tell the girls her heartfelt words.

Last year's May 7th was the first anniversary of the youth going to the countryside. On this day, Lin Grandma made coarse rice cakes and bitter vegetable soup for the youth. As they ate the bitter food, Lin Grandma, with tears streaming down her face, recounted her family history. Lin Grandma was born into a poor peasant family, and the whole family worked like oxen and horses for the landlord all year round but still could not eat a full meal. She went begging when she was very young. Once, she went to a landlord's door to beg for food, and the heartless landlord not only did not give a single grain of rice but also let out a vicious dog to bite people. Lin Grandma, while denouncing, rolled up her trousers to reveal the scars left by the dog bite, and said angrily, "The landlord is our poor people's mortal enemy! Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense about 'the poor welcome exploitation' is speaking for the landlords and rich peasants, trying to make us take the road back, suffer twice, and we must not agree! I will risk my old life to fight with him!" Lin Grandma's denunciation ignited the indignation of all the youth, and the girls firmly declared to the poor and lower-middle peasants, "Never forget class bitterness, always remember blood debt, follow Chairman Mao, and never turn back!" Lin Grandma was moved and said, "This is what I really want to say."

    贫下中农在教育他们
    辽宁省金县湾里公社林场大队的广大贫下中农，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，两年多来，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对在本大队落户的十五名知识青年进行了再教育。下面就是他们教育青年的几个小故事。
    老队长治“病”
    知识青年郝玉华刚到农村那阵子，有个“关节炎病”，三天两头犯，下地干活时犯了病，就躺在地上不能动弹。小郝说她这病不适合在农村劳动，得回大连休息。可是，后来小郝并没回大连。如今，她的病早就好了，劳动中拣重活干，上山下岭样样行。若问是谁治好了她的病？她说：“是俺队的老队长。”
    老队长叫林喜昌。头一回听说小郝病了，他心里挺着急。后来一了解，小郝的“病”是这样得的：小郝在大连的时候，一心想到农村好好欣赏一下大自然的秀丽景色。可是一到林场大队第四队，就后悔了。她觉得在这个山沟里闷乎乎的，没有什么前途，于是就千方百计找借口回大连。
    老队长知道了这个底细，就想：小郝怕苦怕累，想回城里贪图安逸，这不是在革命道路上要当逃兵吗？从此以后，老队长就和贫下中农经常找小郝谈心，一起学习毛主席著作。有一天，小郝又“病”了，老队长就坐在她身边，和她一起学习“老三篇”，并向她讲革命先烈为了人民的解放事业壮烈牺牲的英雄故事。小郝越学越躺不住了。她觉得自己对不起伟大领袖毛主席，对不起贫下中农，对不起革命先烈，她决心要在农村扎根，并在群众中狠斗了私心。从那以后，小郝的“关节炎”再也不发了。
    小邹的一件衣服
    下乡知识青年邹丽君有一件补了又补的蓝花衣服，是她最爱穿的一件。提起这件蓝花衣服，里面还有一桩故事哩！
    那是刚下乡的时候，小邹衣服破了，她既不愿补，更不想穿。有一次，她的那件蓝花衣服破了，她立即换上一件新的学生装，顺手把那件破衣服扔到墙角去了，再也没理它。
    过了几天，一个傍晚，小邹和伙伴们说笑得正高兴，一眼看见贫农王大娘拿着一件衣服走了进来。大娘问：“这是谁的衣服？”小邹说：“我的，怎么到你手里了，大娘？”大娘说：“我看您成天没有闲工夫，就把这件衣服拿回去洗了洗，补好了。”小邹接过一看，不在意地说：“大娘，这件衣服早就打成废品不要了。”王大娘一听，寻思了半晌才语重心长地说：“孩子，在旧社会咱穷人哪穿得起这样的衣服啊！你们这一代过上了好日子，可千万不能忘本哪！”
    这一夜，小邹翻来复去睡不着觉。“千万不能忘本哪！”大娘这句话在她的耳边不停地回荡。她想起了爸爸在旧社会光着脚板在雪地上给资本家做工的悲惨情景，感到羞愧难当。她一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席著作，认识到把劳动人民的血汗随便“打成废品”，就是丢掉了劳动人民的本色；王大娘给我补的不仅是衣裳上的窟窿，更主要的是堵上了我资产阶级思想泛滥的门。
    从此，小邹穿上了带补钉的衣裳。
    林大娘的心里话
    苦大仇深的林大娘听说中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“剥削有功”、“穷人欢迎剥削”的谬论，真气炸了肺。在一次批判会上，她看这帮小青年的火力不猛，心里就纳闷。可是仔细一琢磨，觉得这也怨不得她们。她们刚从学校出来，过去受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的毒害，受资产阶级知识分子教育，哪里能体会到贫下中农的阶级苦有多深哩！想到这里，林大娘就想把一肚子心里话对姑娘们说一说。
    去年的五月七日是小青年下乡一周年的纪念日。这一天，林大娘为小青年做了糠菜饼子、苦菜汤。一吃起忆苦饭，林大娘便泪水满面地讲起了自己的家史。林大娘出生在一个贫农家庭里，全家人一年到头给地主当牛做马，还是吃不上一顿饱饭。她很小的时候就出外讨饭了。有一次到一个地主家门口讨饭，狼心狗肺的地主不仅不给一粒米，还放出恶狗咬人。林大娘一边控诉，一边挽起裤腿，露出被狗咬后留下的伤疤，大娘愤怒地说：“地主是咱穷人的死对头！中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么‘穷人欢迎剥削’，就是替地主富农说话，妄想拉咱们走回头路，吃二遍苦，坚决不能答应，我豁上老命也要跟他拚！”
    林大娘的控诉，激起了全体知识青年的满腔怒火，姑娘们向贫下中农坚决表示：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，跟着毛主席，永远不回头！”林大娘激动地说：“这才是俺的心里话。”
