The vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural areas of Jiangxi are currently surging forward with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, launching a high tide of winter water conservancy construction. They are making early preparations to secure a bountiful harvest next year.

After more than two years of tempering through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangxi has reached an unprecedented height. They are actively advocating for the development of the collective economy of the people's communes and striving to achieve even greater agricultural harvests. They are determined to make greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. All communes and production brigades have this year universally increased their winter water conservancy construction tasks, resolving to drastically change the face of agricultural water conservancy. At present, water conservancy projects across the province have mostly begun, with some already underway for over half a month. All communes and brigades have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the construction sites, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the construction. The poor and lower-middle peasants participating in the study classes are studying and applying the "Old Three Articles" diligently, frequently using the two yardsticks of "completely" and "thoroughly" to examine and check themselves, promoting the revolutionization of their thinking. After setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the construction sites, Songhu Commune in Nanchang County completed a dike that had not been finished in the past three years, the Liuhu Dike, in just twelve days.

In the course of water conservancy construction, the commune members insist on implementing the policy of self-reliance and thrift, and always consider the overall situation, putting the collective first. Every year, Luojia District in Nanchang County undertakes water conservancy construction, first constructing the Fuxi Dike that benefits themselves, and only after completing it, do they construct the Ganjiang Dike. However, they often run out of time and are unable to complete the Ganjiang Dike construction tasks. This time, they voluntarily proposed to first construct the larger task of the Ganjiang Dike. At present, they are repairing, raising, and reinforcing the Ganjiang Dike with quality that exceeds previous years.

### 为夺取明年农业丰收及早做好准备  江西农村掀起冬修水利高潮

    为夺取明年农业丰收及早做好准备
    江西农村掀起冬修水利高潮
    据新华社南昌二十五日电  江西农村广大贫下中农正以冲天的革命干劲，掀起冬修水利的高潮，为夺取明年农业丰收及早做好准备。
    经过两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，江西广大贫下中农的社会主义觉悟空前提高。他们积极要求发展人民公社集体经济，夺取农业更大丰收，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设作出更大贡献。各公社、生产大队今年普遍增添了冬修水利的任务，决心大改农田水利面貌。现在，全省各地的水利工程大都已经开工，有的已经开工半个多月。各社、队都在工地办起了毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想统帅施工。参加学习班的贫下中农狠学狠用“老三篇”，经常用“完全”、“彻底”两把尺子对照检查自己，促进了思想的革命化。南昌县松湖公社在工地上大办毛泽东思想学习班之后，仅用十二天功夫就修好了一条过去三年没有修成的圩堤——流湖堵口。
    在兴修水利中，社员们坚持贯彻执行自力更生、勤俭建国的方针，而且处处从全局出发，公字当头。南昌县罗家区年年兴修水利，都是先兴修自己受益的抚西大堤，修完后才兴修赣江大堤，但往往因时间不够，兴修赣江大堤的任务不能全部完成。这次，他们主动提出，先修任务大的赣江大堤。目前他们在修赣江大堤中，修补、加高加固的质量都超过了往年。
