The Revolutionary Committee of Fenyi County, Jiangxi, following the great leader Chairman Mao's directive on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," recently sent a batch of cadres to work in rural areas. Some cadres who had gone from home to school to office, stepping through the "three doors," were warmly welcomed and enthusiastically helped by the masses after entering the doors of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many poor and lower-middle peasant members took their hands, teaching them how to plow and wield a hoe. They exclaimed with deep emotion, "From the 'three doors' to the doors of the poor and lower-middle peasants, this time we truly touched the gate of revolutionization!"

They are right! They are correct! Cadres going to work in the countryside, stepping out of the office doors and into the doors of the poor and lower-middle peasants, eating, living, and working with them, truly "touched the gate of revolutionization."

Cadres who have been through the "three doors" and some who have been in offices for a long time, have become detached from the masses, detached from reality, and detached from labor. Moving from one door to another, they never enter the doors of the masses, the doors of reality, the doors of labor. Over time, they will develop the four evils of bureaucratism, conservatism, arrogance, and selfishness, becoming lazy, gluttonous, greedy, and corrupt, easily losing their revolutionary spirit, becoming confused, weak, and unable to distinguish between right and wrong. In a word, they will become revisionists.

This situation is the result of the revisionist line on cadres pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev. In the great upsurge of struggle, criticism, and reform, we must seriously implement Chairman Mao's line on cadres, resolutely eliminate this evil, thoroughly change this situation, go to work in the countryside, and step through the doors of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

This door is the gate of revolutionization, the gate of anti-revisionism and prevention of revisionism, the gate of the great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Stepping through this gate, one can connect with the masses, delve into reality, and maintain the original colors of a revolutionary cadre.

Stepping through this gate, one can sweep away the four evils of bureaucratism, conservatism, arrogance, and selfishness.

Stepping through this gate, one can prevent revisionism.

Stepping through this gate, one can advance more swiftly on the road of revolutionization.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out, "A large number of cadres going to work in the countryside is a very good opportunity for them to re-learn." We should respond to Chairman Mao's great call, re-learn Mao Zedong Thought in the process of going to work in the countryside, and accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, stepping onto the broad road of revolutionization!

    迈进革命化的大门
    辛午
    江西分宜县革命委员会，根据伟大领袖毛主席“精兵简政”的教导，在不久前下放了一批干部到农村劳动。有些从家门到学校门到机关门的“三门”干部，跨进了贫下中农的门以后，受到群众的热烈欢迎和热情帮助。许多贫下中农社员拉着他们的手，教他们扶犁、掌耙，他们感慨万分地说：“由‘三门’迈进了贫下中农的门，这回真正摸到了革命化的门！”
    说得对，说得好！干部下放劳动，走出机关门，跨进贫下中农的门，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，确确实实是“摸到了革命化的门”。
    “三门”干部和一些长期蹲机关的干部，一脱离群众，二脱离实际，三脱离劳动。从这个门走到那个门，又从那个门走到另一个门，走来走去，就是没有走进群众的“门”，实际的“门”，劳动的“门”。日子一久，就会染上官、暮、骄、娇四气，就有可能变得懒、馋、占、贪，就容易“脑袋空虚，腿脚发软，香臭不辨，敌我不分”。一言以蔽之，就是：要变修。
    这种状况，是中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义干部路线的恶果。在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，我们广大干部必须认真执行毛主席的干部路线，坚决铲除这种恶果，彻底改变这种状况，下放劳动，走进贫下中农的大门。
    这个大门是革命化的大门，是反修、防修的大门，是毛泽东思想大学校的大门。
    走进这个大门，就能联系群众，深入实际，保持革命干部的本色。
    走进这个大门，就能横扫官、暮、骄、娇四气。
    走进这个大门，就能防止修正主义。
    走进这个大门，就能沿着革命化的大道更快地前进。
    毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会”。我们应当响应毛主席的伟大号召，在下放劳动的过程中，重新学习毛泽东思想，重新接受工农兵的再教育，走上革命化的康庄大道！
