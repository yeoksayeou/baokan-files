Workers in several Latin American countries have been staging strikes to fight for their right to live, according to a report from Xinhua News Agency.

In Argentina, more than 5,000 workers at the state-owned "La Plata" refinery have been on an indefinite strike since September 25, bringing production to a halt. On October 3, over 100 students in La Plata marched in solidarity with the striking oil workers.

The striking workers at the refinery are undeterred by the Argentine government's threats of severe measures, continuing their strike. This strike has paralyzed the refinery, which supplies 60% of the country's fuel consumption.

In Argentina, 1,200 workers at the U.S.-owned Goodyear Tire Company went on a 48-hour strike on September 27 and have since declared an indefinite strike to protest the company's firing of seven union members. The workers have vowed to continue their struggle.

In Colombia, 1,500 workers at the port of Buenaventura went on strike on September 28, demanding higher wages. The strike has brought all port activities to a standstill. The reactionary government deployed large numbers of troops to suppress the workers, but the workers, undaunted, continued their struggle. With the support of local residents, they held large-scale marches and demonstrations, chanting slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!"

Recently, over 10,000 metallurgical workers in Lima and El Callao Province in Peru announced an indefinite strike to support the strike by workers at the U.S.-owned Ford Motor Company in Peru.

Xinhua News Agency, October 6: A report from Rio de Janeiro states that students in São Paulo, a major industrial city in Brazil, have been continuously holding marches and demonstrations to protest against the brutal rule of the military dictatorship.

On October 2 and 3, students in São Paulo took to the streets to march and demonstrate, strongly condemning the activities of the military dictator Costa e Silva in the city. On October 3, students chanted slogans such as "Down with the dictatorship!" and "Costa, go back!" The demonstrators were brutally suppressed by reactionary mounted police, resulting in the death of one student and injuries to many others.

On the evening of October 4, over 5,000 university students in São Paulo bravely took to the streets again to demonstrate and march, strongly protesting the reactionary military police's massacre of students. After the march, mass meetings were held in various parts of the city.

Over 5,000 Brazilian teachers held a demonstration with banners reading "Against the dictatorship!" in support of the students' anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggle.

    哥伦比亚布埃纳文图拉港的一千五百名工人九月二十八日举行罢工，要求增加工资。由于罢工，这个港的活动已全部陷于瘫痪。反动当局出动大批军队对工人进行镇压，工人们不畏强暴，继续开展斗争。他们在当地居民的支持下，举行大规模的游行示威，高呼打倒美帝国主义等口号。
    不久前，秘鲁首都利马和埃尔卡廖省的一万多名冶金工人宣布举行不定期罢工，声援在秘鲁的美国福特汽车公司工人的罢工斗争。
