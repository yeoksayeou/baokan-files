Wang Chaobi is a student in the 70th Chemistry Class of the Northeast Institute of Technology. When he entered the school, the poor and lower-middle peasants in his village all happily said, “Thanks to Chairman Mao’s blessings, a ‘golden phoenix’ has flown out of this poor mountain valley. Even the children of poor families can go to college.” Little Wang, with the ambition to make Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasants proud, wore straw shoes and patched clothes, bid farewell to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and came from Sichuan Province to the Northeast Institute of Technology.

However, soon after entering the school, due to the influence of various non-proletarian thoughts, Little Wang’s thoughts began to change. He saw some classmates wearing so-called fashionable new clothes, from disliking to envying, and he also tried every means to buy one to wear, hiding the patched clothes under the bed and throwing away the straw shoes.

After the Cultural Revolution began, Little Wang was deceived and harmed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. He wandered around all day, not actively participating in the revolutionary criticism, and became a “freewheeler.”

After the Anshan Steel Workers Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the Northeast Institute of Technology, comrade Ye Donglin of the team learned about Little Wang’s changing thoughts and decided to help him raise his political awareness and guide him to participate in the school’s struggle, criticism, and reform with his classmates. One day, he went to talk with Little Wang and saw him mending a torn piece of clothing. He took the clothes and started mending them while asking about the origin of the clothes. It turned out to be the old clothes Little Wang wore when he first entered the school. After the workers’ teachers entered the school, everyone wore patched work clothes, but they worked with more energy than anyone else. Wang Chaobi was moved by the spirit of the workers’ teachers and found this old piece of clothing to mend. Seeing that Little Wang’s thoughts had begun to change, Teacher Ye mended the clothes with him, recalling bitterness and sweetness, criticizing the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and the bourgeois educational system in poisoning the youth, discussing the great significance of the Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and studying Chairman Mao’s latest instructions. Finally, he meaningfully said to Little Wang, “In the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered because we had no power. Now we poor and lower-middle peasants can go to college because of Chairman Mao’s good leadership. But Liu Shaoqi is promoting a bourgeois educational system in the school, trying to cultivate us, the youth, into successors of the bourgeoisie, to follow his gang of bad guys to restore capitalism, making us suffer twice and endure hardships twice. Can we agree to this?” Little Wang listened to Teacher Ye’s words, recalling his family’s miserable life in the old society and the poor and lower-middle peasants’ entrustment when he left home, and could not hold back his tears. He firmly replied, “We cannot agree! We will never agree!”

Teacher Ye handed the mended clothes to Little Wang and took off the shiny Mao badge from his chest and pinned it on Little Wang’s chest. Little Wang excitedly said, “Teacher Ye, you didn’t just mend a piece of clothing for me, but you also gave me a vivid lesson in Mao Zedong Thought and a class education. In the past, I was deceived by the capitalist roaders, but in the future, I will definitely actively participate in the school’s struggle, criticism, and reform, stand tall and fight against the capitalist roaders, and fight against the reactionary academic authorities of the bourgeoisie to defend Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line!” From then on, Little Wang became active again. He used his personal experience of being persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line to criticize and denounce the poison of the bourgeois educational system, and praised Chairman Mao’s great wisdom. He was always at the forefront, bravely charging onto the battlefield of struggle, criticism, and reform, and became a little hero in the school’s struggle, criticism, and reform. Classmates all said, “Little Wang has changed!”

    “我一定要积极参加学校的斗批改！”
    王朝碧是东北工学院七○化学班的学生。入学时，村里贫下中农都高兴地说：“托毛主席他老人家的福啊，穷山沟里飞出了‘金凤凰’，咱穷人家的孩子也上大学了。”小王怀着为毛主席、为贫下中农争气的雄心壮志，脚穿草鞋，身着带补钉的衣服，告别了贫下中农，从四川省来到了东北工学院。
    可是进学院不久，由于各种非无产阶级思想的影响，小王的思想起了变化。他看到有的同学穿着所谓时髦的新衣服，从讨厌到羡慕，自己也想方设法买了一件穿上，把那件带补钉的衣服塞在床底下，把草鞋也扔到了一边。文化大革命开始后，小王受了党内一小撮走资派的蒙蔽和坑害，整天东游西荡，不积极参加革命大批判，成了“逍遥派”。
    鞍钢工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进东北工学院以后，宣传队的叶东林同志知道了小王思想演变的情况，决心帮助他提高政治觉悟，引导他和同学们一道参加学校的斗、批、改。有一天，他去找小王谈心，看见小王正在补一件破衣服，就抢过衣服一边缝补，一边问这件衣服的来历。原来这就是小王刚入学时穿的那件旧衣服。工人师傅进校后，个个穿着带补钉的工作服，可是干起活来却比谁都有劲。王朝碧被工人师傅的精神所感动，又把这件旧衣服找出来缝补。叶师傅看到小王的思想开始转变，就和他一起忆苦思甜，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫和资产阶级教育制度毒害青年的罪行，一起讨论毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场文化大革命的伟大意义，一起学习毛主席一系列最新指示。最后，他意味深长地对小王说：“过去咱贫下中农受苦，就苦在没权上，现在咱贫下中农能念大学，就是因为有毛主席的好领导。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却在学校里大搞封、资、修的教育，想把我们青年一代培养成为资产阶级接班人，跟着他们那一伙坏蛋去复辟资本主义，让我们受二遍苦，遭二遍罪，咱们能答应吗？”小王听了叶师傅这番话，回想起自己家在旧社会的悲惨生活和离家时贫下中农的嘱托，泣不成声。他坚定地回答说：“不能答应！永远不能答应！”
    叶师傅把补完的衣服递给小王，又把自己胸前金光闪闪的毛主席像章取下来戴在小王胸前，小王激动地说：“叶师傅，你给我补的不光是一件衣服，而是补了一堂生动的毛泽东思想课，一堂阶级教育课。过去我上了走资派的当，今后我一定要积极参加学校里的斗、批、改，挺起腰杆和走资派斗，和反动的资产阶级学术权威斗，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而斗争！”从此，小王又活跃起来了，他以自己受资产阶级反动路线迫害的切身经历，批判、控诉资产阶级教育制度的毒害，颂扬毛主席的英明伟大。他处处走在前面，勇敢地杀上了斗、批、改的战场，成了学校斗、批、改中的小闯将。同学们都说：“小王变样了！”
