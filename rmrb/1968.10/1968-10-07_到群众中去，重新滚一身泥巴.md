As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the editorial note in the October 5 issue of *People's Daily* conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres participating in labor: "A large number of cadres should go down to the countryside to engage in labor. This is an excellent opportunity for cadres to learn anew. Except for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down in batches to engage in labor."

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are of great significance. They are a reliable guarantee for consolidating proletarian dictatorship from the root, an important measure for doing a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation, and for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They are the fundamental way to keep old cadres forever young in revolution, to keep new cadres from becoming detached from the masses, to maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit, and to achieve thought reform.

With boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for the great leader, I have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again. The more I study, the clearer my mind becomes, the brighter my eyes become, and the greater my resolve becomes. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are extremely wise, extremely correct, and extremely timely. Chairman Mao's words truly hit the mark. I support them a thousand times, ten thousand times, and I will carry them out a thousand times, ten thousand times.

I am a cadre from a poor family. In the old society, I herded cattle for landlords and did heavy labor. After joining the revolution, during the war years, I still maintained the character of an ordinary working person, going through wind and rain with the soldiers, facing life and death together. However, after the liberation of the whole country, influenced by the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, I relaxed my ideological remolding, and non-proletarian thoughts gradually increased, and the character of a working person gradually faded. This great and magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has deeply educated me. In late March this year, I went to Zhu Gen Commune to do point work. Once, I worked with the commune members to repair an irrigation canal. After less than two hours, my hands had two large blisters, but I persisted. At night, lying in bed, my waist and legs ached, and I touched the blisters on my hands, my thoughts surged, and I couldn't fall asleep for a long time. These hands once gripped a whip, held a hoe, and carried a gun, and I don't know how many layers of calluses they have worn off. Today, it is still these hands, why have they become so tender? Thinking and thinking, it is not that these hands have changed, but because the environment and status have changed after liberation, staying in the office for too long, the brain has become empty, the feet have become soft, and the hands have become tender. In a word, the mind has changed, and the character of a working person has been lost! Am I not gradually sliding into the mud of revisionism?

Thinking of this, I decided to go among the masses, roll in the mud again, and grind out a new layer of calluses, restore the character of a working person, and let it shine. I wore straw shoes, carried a backpack, and worked with the commune members in the posture of an ordinary worker. Whatever is hard work, I do it; whatever is dirty work, I do it. In this way, the poor and lower-middle peasants welcome me and affectionately call me the "old Eighth Route Army soldier" of the past.

In more than half a year, through deepening into the masses and practicing with the commune members in eating, living, and working together, I deeply feel that the front line of production struggle is a great furnace for educating, reforming, and tempering cadres. This furnace has a high temperature and strong firepower, which can burn away all the poison of revisionism such as "officialdom," "stagnation," and "arrogance," invigorate revolutionary spirit, and keep revolutionary youth forever. I will follow the bright path of cadres participating in labor as indicated by Chairman Mao and walk forever, following Chairman Mao to revolutionize to the end.

    到群众中去，重新滚一身泥巴
    四川乐山五通桥区革命委员会主任　马德学
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入斗、批、改阶段的新形势下，十月五日《人民日报》的编者按中，传达了毛主席关于干部参加劳动的最新指示：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”
    毛主席这一最新指示具有极其重大的意义，这是从根本上巩固无产阶级专政的可靠保证，是搞好斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的重要措施，是使老干部永葆革命青春，使新干部永远不脱离群众，保持蓬勃的革命朝气，实现思想革命化的根本途径。
    我怀着对伟大领袖的无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的最新指示，越学心越明，眼越亮，决心越大。毛主席的这一最新指示非常非常英明，非常非常正确，非常非常及时。毛主席的话真是说到了我们的心坎上。我一千个、一万个拥护，一千个、一万个照办。
    我是由穷苦人家出身的干部。在旧社会，我给地主放过牛，扛过长活。参加革命后，在战争年代，我还是保持着普通劳动人民的本色，同战士一起风里来雨里去，出生入死。但是，全国解放以后，由于受到中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线的影响，我放松了思想改造，非无产阶级思想逐渐多起来了，劳动人民的本色就逐渐减褪了。这次轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动，深深地教育了我。今年三月底，我到竹根公社蹲点。一次我同社员们一起修水渠，干了不到两个小时，手上就磨了两个大血泡，但我还是坚持下来了。晚上，我躺在床上腰痛腿酸，摸着手上的血泡，思想起伏，久久不能入睡。我这双手过去攥过羊鞭子，握过锄把子，拿过枪杆子，不知磨起了多少层硬茧子。今天还是这双手，为什么变得这样娇嫩了呢？想来想去，不是这双手变了，而是因为解放后环境变了，地位也变了，机关蹲久了，脑子变空了，脚变软了，手变嫩了。一句话，思想上变了，丢掉了劳动人民的本色！我这不是逐渐地往修正主义泥坑里滑吗？
    想到这里，我决心到群众中间去，重新滚一身泥巴，重新磨出一层硬茧，恢复劳动人民的本色，让它发扬光大。我穿起草鞋，背起背包，以普通劳动者的姿态和社员一起劳动，哪样活累，我干哪样；哪样活脏，我干哪样。这样，贫下中农都欢迎我，亲切地喊我是“当年的老八路”。
    半年多来，我通过深入群众，同社员们同吃、同住、同劳动的实践，深深体会到：生产斗争的第一线是教育、改造、锻炼干部的大熔炉，这个熔炉温度很高，火力很旺，能够烧掉“官气”、“暮气”、“骄气”等一切修正主义的流毒，振奋革命精神，永葆革命青春。我决心沿着毛主席指引的干部参加劳动的光明大道，永远走下去，跟着毛主席革命到底。
