On the night of October 4, the latest directive from our great leader Chairman Mao was transmitted: "A large number of cadres should be sent down to engage in labor, which is an excellent opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also be sent down in batches to engage in labor." The "May Seventh" cadre school in Liuhe, under the Xiaoxinganling Mountains in Heilongjiang Province, immediately burst into excitement. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoed through the sky.

Cadres from the "May Seventh" cadre school rushed to the school's plaza from all directions, listening over and over again to the latest directive from Chairman Mao as transmitted by the editorial of the People's Daily. They rejoiced that their path aligned with the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Their blood boiled, and their hearts surged with emotion. In front of Chairman Mao's portrait, they shouted and jumped: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your latest directive has expressed the thoughts in the hearts of us, the cadres of the 'May Seventh' cadre school. We will definitely follow your brilliant thoughts, seriously reform our worldview, and walk the path of integrating with the workers and peasants, thoroughly transforming our spiritual outlook, and forever preserving the revolutionary youth of the proletariat!"

Cadres from the third company of the "May Seventh" cadre school, who were working fifteen miles away from the school cutting timber in the deep mountains and dense forests, heard Chairman Mao's latest directive in their tents. Forgetting the fatigue of the day, filled with the revolutionary fervor of the proletariat, they raised red flags, held Chairman Mao's revolutionary books, and sang their self-composed song "Walking on the May Seventh Bright Path" loudly. They crossed mountains and rivers overnight to reach the school headquarters to celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. Cadres from the second company of the cadre school suggested to the school's revolutionary committee that October 4 be made a permanent memorial day for the school.

On this joyous day, many cadres of the "May Seventh" cadre school wrote down their unforgettable diaries, expressing their determination to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A cadre who had never written poetry before wrote passionate verses:

	Chairman Mao's latest directive has come down,
	Infinite joy, infinite love,
	Residing in Liuhe, gazing at Zhongnanhai,
	I vow to pass on the red flag of May Seventh to future generations.

Among the joyous crowd, an old cadre named Wen Rongxi, who used to be a shepherd, was particularly moved. Under Chairman Mao's guidance, Wen Rongxi had once bravely fought against the Japanese invaders and made contributions to the cause of national liberation. After liberation, he moved to a big city and worked in a large organization, gradually becoming estranged from the working-class masses. As a result, he fell behind the great cause of the socialist revolution. In the "May Seventh" cadre school, he picked up his shepherd's crook again and became an ordinary laborer. He felt that he was becoming younger every day, full of energy, and his feelings for Chairman Mao were growing deeper, drawing closer to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, he said with deep emotion: "In the 'May Seventh' cadre school, I saw the excellent traditions I had lost and found the excellent styles I had forgotten."

On the day of celebrating Chairman Mao's latest directive on sending cadres down to engage in labor, Xue Lin, who had participated in the revolutionary work for twenty-one years, happily sang and danced with everyone. After becoming a leading cadre, Xue Lin sat in a tall building and picked up some "official" airs. Today, in the labor life of the "May Seventh" cadre school, he experienced a profound transformation from being an "official" to a commoner. He felt that although his hands and feet were dirtier than before, his mind and soul were much cleaner.

Revolutionary rebels who had charged forward in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution felt that they had nothing to reform when they first came to the "May Seventh" cadre school. After studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, they received great education and inspiration. Many expressed their determination to preserve revolutionary youth and grasp the reform of their worldview; many expressed their desire to quickly move their families to the cadre school and settle down here permanently. The company leader of the first company, Liu Junjie, originally thought that he came from a poor peasant family, had worked at the grassroots level for a long time, had only recently come to the provincial organization, had not picked up any bad habits, and was a rebel in the Cultural Revolution. Therefore, after coming to the "May Seventh" cadre school, he did not grasp the reform of his worldview tightly. After listening to the broadcast, he said excitedly: Chairman Mao's latest directive has great significance for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism. I stood on the right side in the Cultural Revolution, but this does not guarantee that I will never fall behind in the future. In the struggle between the two lines, there is always the issue of choosing sides. If I do not follow Chairman Mao's directive to learn anew through labor sent-down, and thoroughly revolutionize my spiritual outlook, I will become a fleeting figure.

Cadres who had made mistakes in the past and were studying at the "May Seventh" cadre school were deeply moved after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive. A former deputy secretary of the provincial propaganda department listened to the broadcast and could not sleep. With tears in his eyes, he told his comrades: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has saved me from the quagmire of revisionism. I am determined to follow Chairman Mao's 'May Seventh' directive, walk the path of integrating with the workers and peasants, and thoroughly reform my worldview. I will firmly walk this path and walk all the way to communism."

Cadres of the "May Seventh" cadre school in Liuhe have taken solid steps on the road of thought revolutionization, but they say: "This is just the first step of the Long March of ten thousand li, and the journey ahead is longer and more arduous. We must follow Chairman Mao's latest directive and stride forward on the bright path of the 'May Seventh' directive." The revolutionary committee of the cadre school has decided: We must be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, and advance bravely along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, turning the cadre school into a great furnace for cultivating proletarian revolutionary warriors.

Forestry workers near the "May Seventh" cadre school heard Chairman Mao's latest directive, were overjoyed, and immediately sent representatives to walk thirty miles to the cadre school to express their warm congratulations and discuss with the cadres their understandings of studying Chairman Mao's latest directive. They said excitedly: "You can listen to Chairman Mao's words, be both an 'official' and a commoner, and walk the path of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is great! We, the working class, firmly support you." Old poor peasant Guan Wenbin deeply felt that: "Chairman Mao's latest directive is great! I often think of the old cadres during the land reform. They were closely connected with us poor and lower-middle peasants, breath to breath. Later, the cadres went to the city, and some of them became estranged from us. They looked down on us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we poor and lower-middle peasants also looked down on them. You follow Chairman Mao's teachings, engage in labor sent-down, and get close to us poor and lower-middle peasants again. We see the good cadres who are closely connected with us, just like during the land reform. We need such cadres!"

Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, with the strong support of local workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, the "May Seventh" cadre school in Liuhe is advancing in great strides. The cadres of the school excitedly say: Chairman Mao, the "May Seventh" warriors will forever be loyal to you!

### 毛主席啊，“五·七”战士永远忠于您！

    毛主席啊，“五·七”战士永远忠于您！
    十月四日夜晚传来了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”黑龙江省小兴安岭下的柳河“五·七”干校，顿时沸腾起来了。“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声响彻云霄。
    “五·七”干校的学员们从四面八方涌到学校广场，一遍又一遍地倾听着《人民日报》编者按传达的毛主席的最新指示，欢呼自己所走的道路，符合了毛主席指引的方向。他们热血沸腾，心潮激荡，在毛主席像前欢呼着，跳跃着：毛主席啊，毛主席！您的最新指示说出了我们“五·七”干校学员的心里话。我们一定永远按照您的光辉思想，认真改造世界观，走与工农相结合的道路，使自己的精神面貌来一个彻底的变化，永葆无产阶级革命的青春！
    正在学校十五里地以外担任采伐木材的“五·七”干校三连的学员，在深山密林的帐篷里听到了毛主席的最新指示。他们忘记了一天的疲劳，满怀无产阶级的革命激情，高举红旗，手捧毛主席的革命宝书，豪迈地唱着自编的歌曲《走在五七光辉大道上》，连夜翻山过河赶到校部，庆祝毛主席最新指示的发表。干校二连的学员们向学校革委会建议：把十月四日作为学校永久的纪念日。
    “五·七”干校的许多学员，在这个大喜的日子里写下了自己一生难忘的日记，表示要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。一位从来没有写过诗的干部挥笔写下了热情洋溢的诗句：
    毛主席最新指示传下来，
    无限的喜啊，无限的爱，
    身居柳河眼望中南海，
    誓把“五·七”红旗传万代。
    在欢乐的人群中，原来是放羊娃的老干部温溶洗特别激动。在毛主席的教导下，温溶洗当年曾同日本侵略者英勇战斗过，为民族的解放事业作出过贡献。解放后他进了大城市，蹲入了大机关，同工农群众逐渐疏远，结果赶不上社会主义革命伟大事业的前进步伐。在“五·七”干校里，他重新拿起牧羊鞭，做一个普通劳动者。他感到现在越活越年轻，整天有使不完的劲，对毛主席的感情越来越深，同毛主席的革命路线越靠越近。他听了毛主席的最新指示以后，万分感慨地说：“在‘五·七’干校，看到了我过去丢掉了的优良传统，找到了我过去忘掉了的优良作风。”
    在欢庆毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示的日子里，参加革命工作二十一年的薛琳，高兴地和大家一起高歌欢舞。薛琳在当了领导干部后，蹲在大楼里，沾染上了“官”气。今天，在“五·七”干校的劳动生活中，他经历了由“官”到民的深刻变化。他感到自己的手脚虽然比过去脏了，但是思想灵魂却比过去干净得多了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的革命造反派，刚来到“五·七”干校时，个别人觉得自己没有什么好改造的。他们学习了毛主席的最新指示，受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。许多人表示要永葆革命青春，狠抓世界观的改造；许多人表示要尽快把家搬到干校，在这里长期安家落户。干校一连连长刘俊杰同志，本来认为自己是贫农家庭出身，长期在基层工作，刚到省机关不久，没有沾上什么坏作风，文化大革命运动中又是造反派，因此，他到“五·七”干校以后，对自己世界观的改造抓得不紧。这次听了广播以后，他激动地说：毛主席的最新指示对反修、防修有重大的意义，我在文化大革命中站对了队，但这并不能保证我今后永远不掉队。在两条路线斗争中，时刻都有个站队的问题。如果不按照毛主席的指示，在下放劳动中重新学习，使自己的精神面貌来一个彻底的革命化，就会成为昙花一现的人物。
    在“五·七”干校学习的过去犯过错误的干部，学习了毛主席的最新指示，心情非常激动。原省委宣传部一位副秘书长，听了广播后怎么也睡不着。他含着热泪对同志们说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把我从修正主义的泥坑中挽救了出来。我决心沿着毛主席‘五·七’指示的方向，走与工农相结合的道路，彻底改造世界观。这条路我一定要坚定不移地走下去，一直走到共产主义。”
    柳河“五·七”干校的学员们，在思想革命化的道路上迈出了坚实的第一步，但是他们说：“这仅仅是万里长征刚刚迈出第一步，以后的路程更长、更艰巨。我们一定要遵照毛主席的最新指示，在‘五·七’指示的光辉道路上，大踏步地向前迈进。”干校革委会已经作出决定：一定要谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进，把干校办成培养无产阶级革命战士的大熔炉。
    “五·七”干校附近的林业工人听到了毛主席的最新指示，欢欣鼓舞，马上派出代表，步行三十里来到干校表示热烈祝贺，并和学员们一起畅谈学习毛主席最新指示的体会。他们激动地说：“你们能听毛主席的话，既当‘官’，又当老百姓，走与工农兵相结合的道路，这太好了！我们工人阶级坚决支持你们。”老贫农关文斌深有感触地对学员们说：“毛主席的最新指示太好了！我时常想着土改时的老干部，他们和我们贫下中农血肉相连，息息相关。以后干部进了城，有些人和我们渐渐疏远了，他们看不起我们贫下中农，我们贫下中农也看不起他们。你们按照毛主席的教导，下放劳动，和我们贫下中农又接近起来，我们又看到了土改时期那样和我们血肉相连的好干部，我们需要这样的干部！”
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在当地工人和贫下中农的大力支持下，柳河“五·七”干校正在阔步前进。干校的学员激动地说：毛主席啊，“五·七”战士永远忠于您！
