The revolutionary committee of Wutongqiao District in Leshan Region, Sichuan Province, was established in February this year. In just six months, the committee has shown vigorous vitality.

Wutongqiao District Revolutionary Committee is a county-level organization. The first round of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy reduced the number of staff from 170 to 44. Following that, a second round of streamlining reduced the number to 38, establishing two departments and one office (Political Department, Production Department, and Office). At this point, some people thought that streamlining and reducing bureaucracy meant the fewer people, the better, focusing solely on the idea of "less is more." Others believed that the workload of 170 people was now on the shoulders of just over 30, making it impossible to breathe. Thus, they sought solutions within the administrative circle. After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, how should the revolutionary committee conduct its work? Comrade Ma Dexue, the head of the district revolutionary committee and a military representative, led everyone to find the answer through practice: walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics!

A Thought-Provoking Meeting

Not long after the revolutionary committee's second round of streamlining, a four-level cadre meeting was held to arrange the year's production plan. In the past, such meetings required mobilization from all departments, at least one to two months of preparation, including land surveys, production evaluations, measure planning, and setting targets. The result was that upper-level targets were passed down, while lower levels requested tools and fertilizers, leading to endless negotiations and turning production meetings into squabbles. This year was different. The revolutionary committee decided to hold the meeting for only eight days, with seven days dedicated to "abstract discussions" on emphasizing proletarian politics and studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Only one day was used to discuss and arrange the production plan.

This was the first significant battle for the revolutionary committee after streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, determining the path it should take. However, some people did not understand this approach to the meeting, worrying that the plan would not be implemented and production would fail. Comrade Ma Dexue, the head of the district revolutionary committee and a military representative, explained Chairman Mao's instructions on emphasizing politics and Vice Chairman Lin's five principles for emphasizing politics. He required everyone to lead with proletarian politics to conduct a good meeting.

Ma Dexue did this after thorough investigation and research. He discovered that some cadres had a "shift change" mentality, while others wanted to report numerous difficulties to the revolutionary committee. These active thoughts needed to be addressed; otherwise, even the best plans would be useless. Therefore, at the beginning of the meeting, he first organized everyone to discuss the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, share experiences from criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and repeatedly study the "Three Articles" and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work from Dazhai. Through learning, everyone clarified the direction and strengthened their confidence. Finally, the meeting allowed everyone to set their own targets and report their plans, resulting in the entire year's production plan being arranged in just half a day.

This meeting had a profound educational impact on everyone. People said, "Who would have thought that the power of emphasizing proletarian politics is so great!"

Moving the Office to the Grassroots

How should the revolutionary committee work after streamlining and reducing bureaucracy? This is indeed a question.

In a situation with few people and many tasks, how can one break free from administrative routines and demonstrate a new style? Initially, some people were unclear. Many thought that with so much work to do and the emphasis on going deep into the grassroots and among the masses, this was a new "old difficult problem."

So, how should it be done?

Just after the four-level cadre meeting, Comrade Ma Dexue led the members of the revolutionary committee to the grassroots to find answers. They wore straw hats, straw shoes, carried their own backpacks, and appeared before the masses as ordinary laborers, blending in with the people. Wherever they went, they set up offices on the spot, conducted investigations and research on the spot, and solved problems on the spot. Except for major principle issues that had to be resolved through meetings at the headquarters, they insisted on staying in the grassroots, working with the masses. As a result, many problems were solved at the grassroots level, and those who insisted on working at the headquarters found that there was not much to do and all wanted to go deep into the grassroots and among the masses. The problem of not being able to go down was solved.

Through this practice, the comrades of Wutongqiao District Revolutionary Committee happily said, "Chairman Mao taught us: 'The reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to be in contact with the masses.' We used to learn this, but we did not truly understand it. Now we finally understand a bit. As long as we grasp this fundamental point, all problems can be solved."

For example, one of the most difficult problems in Wutongqiao District during the Cultural Revolution was mobilizing and educating some educated youth who had returned to the city to go back to their workstations. This problem was not well solved in the offices. Later, the member of the district revolutionary committee responsible for this work simply left the office and went deep down. On one hand, they did work with the families of the educated youth, spreading Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and on the other hand, they organized the educated youth to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helping them improve their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, and exposing a handful of class enemies' plots to sabotage the educated youth going to the countryside. Soon, this most troublesome problem was satisfactorily solved.

Again, for over a decade, Wutongqiao District could not be self-sufficient in grain, and the state had to return-sell 200,000 catties of grain every year, becoming a long-standing difficult problem that Wutongqiao District could not solve.

Could it really not be solved? The members of the revolutionary committee followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "All conclusions come at the end of investigating the situation," and went deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research. They found that the truly grain-deficient production teams were not many; mainly, under the instigation of a handful of class enemies and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, some production teams had developed a habit of relying on the state for many years, lacking the spirit of self-reliance. Therefore, they organized everyone to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai, establishing the idea of self-reliance and hard work. For the few grain-deficient teams, grain was appropriately adjusted based on voluntary consultations with wealthy teams. Thus, the long-standing difficult problem of relying on the state to return-sell grain, which could not be solved, was solved in front of the newly established revolutionary committee. The workers and peasants deeply felt: In the past, the capitalist roaders within the party said that this place was an industrial area, grain could not be self-sufficient, and it had to rely on state supply. Now it is seen that this is a wrong path that pushes us into a muddy pit!

Firmly Grasp the Thought Reform

After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, is there nothing more to do in building the revolutionary committee itself? The comrades of Wutongqiao District gave a negative answer.

They said: "Streamlining and reducing bureaucracy" means the troops must be elite. Without thought reform, how can we "organize a revolutionary and mass-connected leading cadre?" Thought reform is the guarantee of organizational reform. To talk about organizational reform without thought reform is empty talk.

However, how can the members of the revolutionary committee maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit in class struggle and become an elite force? In this regard, they went through a bumpy road.

After the establishment of the Wutongqiao District Revolutionary Committee, two rounds of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy were conducted. People's ideological awareness was raised, the style of the office was changed, and they won the praise of the broad revolutionary masses. They carried their backpacks and went deep into the grassroots, and the masses called them "The Eighth Route Army is back!" They solved some difficult problems for the masses, and the masses praised them as "good servants of the people." At this time, some leading cadres thought, "The situation is settled, and we should proceed with the work step by step," gradually not listening to the masses' opinions, and bureaucratism began to grow; some mass representatives thought, "I came from the masses, so there is no problem of going deep into the masses," and were not interested in going deep into the masses.

At the same time, the revolutionary committee had an incident: One day, a poor peasant girl came to the revolutionary committee to report some problems in her life and asked for help to solve them. The comrade in charge of reception picked up the phone and said it was solved, then let the girl go back. The next day, the girl ran back, saying her problem was not solved. The comrade in charge of this work impatiently said, "These small matters, with fewer people, we can't handle them all, we can only grasp the general direction." Using a half-soft, half-hard method, she pushed her out.

Military representative Comrade Party Yongsong discovered this problem and thought it was a manifestation of the old office style in the new revolutionary committee. "Fewer people can't handle it" is an excuse, it's troublesome, seeking comfort, and the bureaucratic habit of "being an official and a lord" is the real problem. Therefore, he organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" and the brilliant works "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts," carry out criticism and repudiation of selfishness, and thoroughly dig out the bourgeois "self" in the mind, and thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist garbage spread by Liu Shaoqi. After raising awareness, Party Yongsong and the comrade in charge of this work went to the girl's home to understand the situation and helped her solve the difficulties.

One incident, two attitudes, two results. This rang the alarm for the revolutionary committee: After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the thought education of the revolutionary committee's staff must be grasped at all times, and the thought reform must be firmly grasped; only by doing a good job in thought reform can we go deep into the masses and be heart-to-heart with the masses, understand the sufferings of the masses; only by doing a good job in thought reform can the organizational reform be guaranteed. To thoroughly revolutionize, we must smash the old ideas, old habits, and old styles of the old offices, and establish new ideas and new styles of the proletarian revolutionary power. While continuously fighting against the bourgeois "self" in people's minds, this is the key point.

The Wutongqiao District Revolutionary Committee grasped this key point. Whether working in the office or going deep into the grassroots, they regularly conducted small rectification movements and regularly held lectures on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In the rectification and lectures, they talked a lot about the bitterness of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; they criticized the harm brought by old ideas and old styles and established the new style of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

The comrades of Wutongqiao District Revolutionary Committee said: After streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, it is not about the number of people but about how well the thought reform is done. If the thought reform is done well, one person can be as effective as ten.

Six Months' Conclusion

Chairman Mao taught: "Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work."

Vice Chairman Lin said: "Emphasizing politics is not an arbitrary policy, not that it can be done this way or that way. This is a fundamental measure proposed based on the development law of socialist society and the economic foundation of socialist society. Not emphasizing politics is to violate the development law of socialist society."

The Wutongqiao District Revolutionary Committee followed the teachings of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, placing the emphasis on proletarian politics in a very important position, thereby promoting the thought reform of people, maintaining the good style of the revolutionary committee, and achieving fruitful results in revolution and production. Here is an example to illustrate:

When the Wutongqiao District Revolutionary Committee conducted the second round of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, some cadres had difficulty understanding. They said, "The work of 100 to 200 people was already heavy on the shoulders of 40-plus people, and now we have to 'streamline' again. Even with three heads and six arms, it's hard to handle, so it's better to leave the revolutionary committee early to avoid making mistakes." After the military representative led everyone to go deep into the grassroots and solve problems at the grassroots, they tasted the sweetness, and their thoughts became clear. In the past, some people thought that the more organizations, the better. Now, although some departments have not been abolished, they have become very streamlined. In the past, there were ten people in charge of culture, education, and health, and after streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, there were three. Some people had difficulty understanding. After leaving the office, only one person remained, and they also took on other work.

The Wutongqiao District Revolutionary Committee insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics, making this region, where class struggle is very complex, undergo earth-shaking changes. Revolution and production presented a prosperous scene. The revolutionary criticism was widely and deeply carried out, a handful of class enemies were frightened, reactionary anarchism and the "multi-center theory" became rats crossing the street, and the bad social customs were severely struck down. Industrial and agricultural production was booming, and this year, the entire district's early and middle-season rice achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

    精兵简政以后的路子怎么走？
    ——四川省乐山地区五通桥区革命委员会访问记
    四川省乐山地区五通桥区的革命委员会，是今年二月成立的。在短短六个月中，革委会已经显示出朝气勃勃的强大生命力。
    五通桥区革委会是县一级机构。第一次实行精兵简政，把原来一百七十名工作人员减少到四十四人，接着第二次精兵简政，又减少到三十八人，建立了二部一室（政治部、生产部和办公室）。这时候，有人认为，精兵简政就是人越少越好，尽在“少”字上打转转。也有人认为，一百七十人的担子放在三十几个人的肩上太重了，压得喘不过气来，于是就在事务性的圈子里找出路。实行精兵简政以后，革委会到底该怎样进行工作？区革委会主任、军队代表马德学同志，带领大家在实践中找到了答案，就是：走突出无产阶级政治的道路！
    一次发人深省的会议
    革委会第二次精简机构不久，要开一个安排今年生产计划的四级干部会议。过去开这样的会，各机关总动员，起码要准备一、两个月，查地、评产，订措施，提指标，算盘珠拨来拨去，结果是上边下达指标，下边要农具化肥，互相讨价还价，把生产会议开成扯皮会、吵架会。今年不同往年，革委会决定这次会议只开八天，七天是“务虚”，讲突出无产阶级政治，讲活学活用毛泽东思想，只用一天时间讨论、安排生产计划。
    这是精兵简政后革委会应当走什么道路的带有决定意义的第一仗。但有些人对这次会议这样开法不理解，他们担心计划落实不了，生产落空不好交账。革委会主任、军队代表马德学同志就给大家讲了毛主席关于突出政治的指示和林副主席提出的突出政治的五项原则，要求他们无产阶级政治挂帅来开好这个会。
    马德学这样做，是经过了调查研究的。他发现部分干部有“换班”思想；也有部分干部是想来向革委会反映一大堆困难的。这些活思想不解决，计划再好也没有用。因此，这次会议一开始，他首先组织大家畅谈文化大革命的大好形势，讲斗私批修的心得，反复学习“老三篇”以及大寨人自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神。大家经过学习，明确了方向，增强了信心。最后，会议让大家自己提指标，报计划，结果只用半天时间就把全年生产计划安排下来。
    这次会议对大家教育很深刻，人们说：“真没料到，突出无产阶级政治的威力这么大！”
    把办公室搬到基层去
    革委会实行精兵简政后怎样开展工作，确实是一个问题。
    在人少、工作多的情况下，怎样跳出事务性的圈子，体现出新作风？开始，有些人不明确。有不少人认为，现在要做的工作这样多，又强调要深入基层、深入群众，这真是个新的“老大难”问题。
    究竟怎样办好？
    四级干部会刚开完，马德学同志带领革委会成员到基层去寻找答案。他们头戴草帽，脚穿草鞋，自己背着背包，以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。他们走到那里，就在那里就地办公，就地调查研究，就地解决问题。除有重大原则问题必须回机关开会解决外，就是天塌下来也坚持在基层，和群众在一起。这样做的结果，大量问题在基层得到了解决，在机关坚持工作的同志，反而觉得没有多少事情可做，都纷纷要求深入基层，到群众中去。下不去的问题解决了。
    通过这次实践，五通桥区革委会的同志高兴地说，毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”过去我们学是学了，但并没有真正理解，现在才算懂得了一些。只要抓住这条根本，什么问题都可以迎刃而解。
    譬如，五通桥区在文化大革命中最大的“老大难”问题之一是，动员、教育一部分在文化大革命中回到城市的上山下乡知识青年返回工作岗位。过去在机关里这个问题一直没有得到很好解决。后来，负责这个工作的区革委会成员干脆离开机关，深入下去，一方面做知识青年家属的工作，向他们宣传毛主席的最新指示，一方面把知识青年组织起来，开办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助他们提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，揭发一小撮阶级敌人破坏知识青年上山下乡的阴谋。不久，这个最难缠的“老大难”问题，圆满地解决了。
    又如，五通桥区十几年来，粮食一直不能自给，年年国家要返销二十万斤粮食，成为五通桥区长年不能解决的“老大难”问题。
    真的不能解决吗？革委会成员遵照毛主席“一切结论产生于调查情况的末尾”的教导，深入到群众中进行调查研究。他们发现，真正缺粮的生产队并不多，主要是在一小撮阶级敌人挑拨和党内一小撮走资派的怂恿下，有些生产队多年来养成了依赖国家的习惯，缺乏自力更生的革命精神。于是，他们就组织大家学习大寨人的革命精神，树立自力更生、奋发图强的思想。至于少数缺粮队，在和富裕队自愿协商的基础上，粮食进行适当的调济。这样，长期靠国家返销粮食而无法解决的“老大难”问题，在新生的革委会面前解决了。工农群众深有体会地说：过去党内走资派说我们这里是工业区，粮食不能自给，要靠国家供应，现在才看到，这是把我们往泥坑里推的一条邪路！
    狠抓人的思想革命化
    精兵简政以后，革委会本身的建设，是不是再没有什么事可作了呢？五通桥区的同志们的回答是否定的。
    他们说：“精兵简政”，兵就要精。没有思想革命化的能联系群众的“兵”，怎能“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”？思想革命化是组织革命化的保证，离开思想革命化讲组织革命化，那就是空谈。
    但是，怎样使革委会成员在阶级斗争中，永远保持旺盛的革命斗志，成为一支“精兵”？在这方面，他们走了一段不平坦的道路。
    五通桥区革委会成立以后，进行了两次精兵简政，人的思想觉悟提高了，机关的作风改变了，博得了广大革命群众一片赞扬。他们背起背包深入基层，群众称他们“老八路又来了！”他们给群众解决了一些“老大难”问题，群众夸他们是“人民的好勤务员”。这时候，有的领导干部认为“大势已定，该按部就班进行工作了”，对群众的意见渐渐听不进，官僚主义开始滋长；有些群众代表认为“我就是从群众中来的，不存在深入群众的问题”，对深入群众兴趣不大。
    与此同时，革委会发生了这样一件事：一天，有个贫下中农女青年，到革委会反映自己生活上的一些问题，请求帮助解决。负责接待的同志拿起电话一打，说是解决了，就让这个女青年回去。第二天，女青年又跑来，说她的问题还没得到解决。负责这个工作的同志不耐烦地说：“这些小事，人少管不过来，我们只能掌握大方向。”用半软不硬的办法给推了出去。
    军队代表党永松同志发现这个问题后，认为这是旧机关作风在新生革委会中的表现。“人少管不过来”是借口，嫌麻烦，图安逸，“做官当老爷”的官僚主义习气，才是问题的实质。于是，就组织大家学习毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，开展斗私批修，狠挖头脑中的资产阶级“私”字，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的反革命修正主义黑货。认识提高后，党永松和负责这一工作的同志一起到女青年家里了解情况，帮助她解决了困难。
    一件事情，两种态度，两个效果。这给革委会敲了警钟：精兵简政以后，对革委会的工作人员，必须时刻掌握思想教育，狠抓人的思想革命化；搞好了思想革命化，才能深入群众，和群众心连心，体察群众疾苦；搞好了思想革命化，组织革命化才有保证。要彻底革命，必须打碎旧机关的旧观念，旧习惯，旧作风，树立无产阶级革命政权的新思想、新作风。而同人们头脑里的资产阶级“私”字作持续不断的斗争，是这个问题的焦点。
    五通桥区革委会抓住这个焦点，不管在机关坚持工作，还是深入基层，都定期进行小整风，定期举行活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会。在整风和讲用中，大诉中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线的苦，大谈毛主席革命路线的甜；大批旧观念、旧作风带来的危害，大立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的新风尚。
    五通桥区革委会的同志说：实行精兵简政后，不在人多少，而在于思想革命化搞得怎样。思想革命化搞得好，一个能顶十个用。
  六个月的结论
    毛主席教导说：政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”
    林副主席说：“突出政治不是一项任意的政策，不是可以这样做，也可以那样做。这是根据社会主义社会的发展规律和社会主义社会的经济基础所提出的根本措施。不突出政治，就是违反社会主义社会发展的规律。”
    五通桥区革命委员会遵循毛主席和林副主席的教导，把突出无产阶级政治放在极其重要的地位，从而促进了人的思想革命化，保持了革命委员会的好作风，使革命和生产取得了丰硕的成果。这里举一个例子就可以说明：
    五通桥区革委会第二次实行精兵简政时，有些干部思想不通。他们说，过去一、二百人的工作放到四十几个人肩上，担子已经够重了，现在还要“精简”，就是长三头六臂，也拨拉不开，不如趁早离开革委会，免得犯错误。经过军队代表带领大家深入基层，在基层解决问题，尝到了甜头，思想通了。过去有些人认为机构越多越好，现在有些部门虽然没有取消，但已经十分精干了。过去，管文教卫生的有十人，实行精兵简政后是三人，有些人思想不通。走出办公室后，只剩一人，还兼管其他工作。
    五通桥区革委会坚持突出无产阶级政治，使这个阶级斗争非常复杂的地区，发生了天翻地覆的变化。革命、生产呈现出一派欣欣向荣的景象。革命大批判广泛而深入地开展起来，一小撮阶级敌人闻风丧胆，反动的无政府主义和“多中心论”成了过街老鼠，社会上的不良风气遭到了狠狠打击，工农业生产热气腾腾，今年全区早中稻获得了空前大丰收。
