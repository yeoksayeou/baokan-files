The original two middle schools in Gaojia Shop Commune, Nongan County, Jilin Province, were established under different circumstances. One was founded in 1964 by poor and lower-middle peasants under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line—the Taipingling Agricultural Middle School. The other was established in 1962—the Nongan County 17th Middle School. The two schools are just a short distance apart, but one is managed by poor and lower-middle peasants, while the other is controlled by a handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois intellectuals within the Party.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered the stage of comprehensive struggle, criticism, and transformation, the poor and lower-middle peasants took up the mighty weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and fiercely criticized the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. They raised high the red banner of adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line at Taipingling Agricultural Middle School.

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Must Seize the Pen

In 1962, although the 17th Middle School was built at the doorstep of Taipingling Production Brigade, many children of poor and lower-middle peasants were still kept out. In the entire brigade of 194 households of poor and lower-middle peasants, there was only one high school student; while among the 41 households of landlords and rich peasants, there were two college students and three high school students. Under the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois intellectuals, the 17th Middle School set up various barriers such as age, tuition, exams, and retention, discriminating against and harassing the children of poor and lower-middle peasants in every possible way. In 1964, out of 33 students who graduated from primary school, 28 children of poor and lower-middle peasants did not advance to middle school. Even those lucky enough to enter middle school were poisoned by China's Khrushchev's "study to become an official" theory, and some of them "forgot their hometown after entering a foreign school." One student, after studying for three years at the 17th Middle School, developed nearsightedness and became effeminate, unable to write a note with a pen or plant seedlings with a hoe. The poor and lower-middle peasants were indignant, saying: "In such a foreign school, the more you study, the more alienated you become from us poor and lower-middle peasants. The more you study, the further you drift away from us poor and lower-middle peasants. If this continues, it won't be long before people turn into revisionists and the power turns color."

Chairman Mao's brilliant directive on "cultivating successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution" pointed the way for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants here. They resolutely took the road of "educational revolution" pointed out by Chairman Mao, according to their own wishes, and established a middle school. It was difficult for a brigade to run a middle school, but the poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought displayed self-reliance. There were no classrooms, so the production team arranged them; there were no desks, so they built them themselves; there were no chairs, so the students brought them from home. Thus, on October 25, 1964, a new type of agricultural middle school—Taipingling Agricultural Middle School—was established in the horse stable of the Fourth Production Brigade.

Running the School in the Image of the Proletariat

After the establishment of Taipingling Agricultural Middle School, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants decided to follow Chairman Mao's great policy of "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor" and run the school in the image of the proletariat. They said: "We must turn over the entire set of bourgeois educational systems." This school had several distinctive features:

First, everything was convenient for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

There was one incident that made the poor and lower-middle peasants very angry. Once, the 17th Middle School, controlled by a handful of capitalist-roaders, refused to admit a peasant's son whose score exceeded the admission standard; instead, they raised the score of a student with personal connections by 35 points and admitted him to the school. As soon as the Agricultural Middle School was established, the poor and lower-middle peasants took the reins of power into their own hands. They elected Comrade Wang Xing, the Party branch secretary who was politically outstanding and held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, as the principal, and formed a school committee composed of militia battalion commanders, old poor peasants, and revolutionary teachers and students. The poor and lower-middle peasants became the masters of the school. After the establishment of the Agricultural Middle School, the admission of new students was completely different from that of the 17th Middle School. As long as the children of poor and lower-middle peasants wanted to enroll, there were no age restrictions, no exams, and no tuition fees. After the approval of the school committee, they could enroll. Other major matters such as the selection of teachers, curriculum setting, school building construction, and graduate allocation were all discussed and decided by the school committee and then implemented.

Second, smashing the spiritual shackles of "academics first" and "grades as the criterion," with the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the main course, and class struggle as the textbook.

The handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois intellectuals who controlled the 17th Middle School vigorously advocated "academics first" and "grades as the criterion," crazily suppressing and destroying the students' study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The poor and lower-middle peasants were extremely indignant about this. They countered by listing Chairman Mao's works as the main course in their own Agricultural Middle School. The first book given to new students upon enrollment was the shining "Selected Works of Mao Zedong (Type B)," and the first class after the Agricultural Middle School opened was to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Old poor peasants often conducted class education for students in the fields, at the edges of the fields, inside and outside the school. They pointed out to the students: "Poor and lower-middle peasants run schools, not for your high scores, but for your high ideals. With Mao Zedong Thought, you have the ability to serve the people." They placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything. They often held various types of study and application meetings, using the "Three Articles" as weapons to "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism." The school's curriculum was set to "study mainly and learn a little of everything, that is, not only to study literature but also to study industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and to criticize bourgeoisie." Closely linked to the three great revolutionary movements, they opened courses based on what knowledge the poor and lower-middle peasants needed, and promoted the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, using the vast countryside as a classroom. Mathematics classes often conducted on-site teaching, with students personally measuring land and calculating the volume and capacity of manure piles and granaries. The school established experimental fields to cultivate improved varieties for the production brigade, enabling students to master agricultural production technology. The school also established a militia organization, under the leadership of the brigade militia battalion, to learn from the People's Liberation Army's "Four Firsts" and "Three-Eight Style," and to regularly conduct military training. The school actively carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy. Revolutionary teachers and students have written more than 100 articles criticizing China's Khrushchev and other capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Third, implementing the combination of education and productive labor, cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. To keep the students from being corrupted by bourgeois habits and to maintain the simple and honest character of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the Agricultural Middle School, based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants and after discussion by the school committee, decided on several rules: (1) Students were not allowed to ride bicycles, smoke, play cards, or play chess upon arrival at the school; (2) Students had to carry manure baskets to pick manure on their way to and from school; (3) There were no winter and summer vacations, but spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest vacations. Students participated in productive labor with the commune members; (4) Each student had to participate in at least 90 days of collective labor per year, using their own labor income to obtain their personal rations; (5) Through productive labor to transform their thoughts, each agricultural season had to write a summary of their thoughts. Whenever there was a busy agricultural season, they would go to support the brigade that had difficulties. In the spring of 1966, when there was a drought, the 60 mu of corn in Yu Family Circle Production Brigade did not sprout. Upon hearing the news, they rushed to the scene and completed the replanting task in two days without delaying the agricultural season. Over the past four years, the Agricultural Middle School, in addition to building 15 classrooms by themselves, has helped more than 20 production brigades labor more than 100 times, completing more than 100,000 labor days, and collecting more than 200 carts of high-quality fertilizer. They labored in the production brigades, going out early and returning late, without caring about the remuneration. Student Wang Chengfu, on the day of his graduation, participated in the collective labor of the production brigade. He happily told the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants: "The purpose of my studying is to be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought and a new-style peasant. Now my ideal has been realized." Among the 34 graduates of the Agricultural Middle School in 1968, except for two who honorably joined the People's Liberation Army, the rest all happily returned to the production brigades as new-style peasants, becoming the backbone of the three great revolutionary movements, serving as Mao Zedong Thought study and application guidance teachers, with two being elected as militia platoon leaders and one being elected as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the county. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised them, saying: "These students are versatile, can write articles with a pen, can farm with a hoe, can fight with a gun, and can propagate when they step onto the podium. They are all-rounders in the countryside and good successors to the revolution. Sending children to such a school, we are truly a hundred times at ease."

Fourth, pulling down the bourgeois intellectuals and letting the poor and lower-middle peasants step onto the podium, the teachers are both educators and laborers.

The Agricultural Middle School invited brigade cadres, militia cadres, old poor peasants, demobilized soldiers, and rural youth who had undergone labor tempering to be teachers. The brigade Party branch secretary was not only the principal of this school but also a political teacher, often giving lectures on the study of Chairman Mao's works to students and doing political and ideological work on students' active thoughts. Old poor peasants often went to the school to tell students the "three histories" and conduct class education; militia battalion commanders and demobilized soldiers taught military courses, lecturing on combat knowledge and conducting military training; agricultural technicians taught agricultural technology courses, lecturing on agricultural knowledge. The rural youth who taught cultural courses not only taught but also labored, participating in at least 90 days of collective labor per year, and their remuneration did not exceed the work point standard of middle and upper labor force in the production brigade, participating in the distribution in the production brigade.

Advancing in the Struggle Between the Two Lines

After breaking away from the old educational system, Taipingling Agricultural Middle School raised its banner high and launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois educational line with a thoroughly revolutionary posture. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the commune Party committee and the 17th Middle School Party adopted the strategy of "attacking to defend" against the Agricultural Middle School, attempting to corrode this new-type school with decadent bourgeois ideology. They praised "standardization" and "high quality" in every possible way, slandering the Agricultural Middle School as "non-standard, low quality, and unable to educate good students." The class enemies in society also echoed, saying that "students of the Agricultural Middle School are 'dropouts' who are not promising" and "a rabbit's tail cannot grow long." The comrades of the Agricultural Middle School realized that this was a sharp struggle between two ideologies and two lines. They repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution, launching a great discussion on "why to teach" and "why to learn," and initiating a thought revolution to eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit. The teachers had a deep feeling, saying: "The 'standardization' of the old school is bourgeoisification, the 'high quality' of the old school is to raise the 'selfishness' character, we must not fall into its trap!" The students said: "We started our school from scratch, building desks ourselves and bringing chairs from home. This 'poor stick spirit' is the most glorious!"

The Agricultural Middle School showed strong vitality and unparalleled superiority in the struggle, deeply welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants from six nearby brigades sent their children to enroll en masse. The Agricultural Middle School, in less than a year, rapidly developed from one class to six classes, and its reputation became higher and higher. However, the class enemies were not willing to admit their defeat. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the commune Party, relying on the usurped party and government power, dismissed the principal of the Agricultural Middle School, labeled the teachers who dared to struggle against them as "troublemakers," and severely suppressed them; they ordered the students who opposed them to drop out and instigated the "responsible persons" they planted in the Agricultural Middle School to collude with people of unknown origin to establish a blacksmith's forge and set up an "underground factory" to produce products that the countryside did not need at all and engage in speculation. For a time, the Agricultural Middle School was in a state of chaos. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary teachers and students of the Agricultural Middle School, under the support of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, bravely fought back against the white terror of the capitalist reactionary line and finally exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders within the commune and the 17th Middle School, thoroughly smashing the class enemies' conspiracy.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, Taipingling Agricultural Middle School, after four years of struggle, is now on a broader path.

    从两个学校的对比看民办学校的优越性
    调查报告
    吉林省农安县高家店公社原来有两所中学。一所是在毛主席的无产阶级教育路线指引下，于一九六四年由贫下中农创办的太平岭农业中学；另一所是一九六二年建立的农安县第十七中学。两校一道之隔，一所由贫下中农管理，一所由党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子所统治。
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入全面斗、批、改的阶段，贫下中农奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，高高树起了坚持毛主席的无产阶级教育路线的太平岭农中这面红旗。
    贫下中农必须掌握文权
    一九六二年，县第十七中学虽然办到了太平岭大队的家门口，可是，大量的贫下中农子女仍然被拒之门外。在全大队一百九十四户贫下中农中，只有高中生一名；而在四十一户地主、富农中，就有大学生两名，高中生三名。十七中在一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子把持下，设下了年龄、学费、考试、留级等道道关卡，百般歧视、刁难贫下中农子女。一九六四年从小学毕业的三十三名学生中，贫下中农子女就有二十八名没升入中学。就是幸运考入中学的，由于受了中国赫鲁晓夫“读书做官论”的毒害，有些人“进了洋学堂，就忘了土家乡。”有一个学生在十七中念了三年书，落了一双近视眼，染了一身娇气，提笔不会写便条，拿锄开不好庄稼苗。贫下中农气愤地说：“在这种洋学堂里，越学跟咱贫下中农越隔心，越念离咱贫下中农越远。这样下去，用不多久就会人变修，政权变色。”
    毛主席关于“培养无产阶级革命事业接班人”光辉指示的发表，给这里广大贫下中农指明了方向，他们坚决走毛主席指出的“教育要革命”的道路，按照自己的意愿，创办了中学。一个队办一所中学，困难很多。然而用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，发扬了自力更生的精神，没有校舍生产队给安排，没有桌子自己动手搭坯台，没有凳子学生从家拿。就这样，于一九六四年十月二十五日，在第四生产队的喂马站里办起了一所新型的农业中学——太平岭农业中学。
    按照无产阶级的面貌办学
    太平岭农业中学办起来以后，广大贫下中农决心遵照毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的伟大方针，按照无产阶级的面貌办学。他们说：“我们必须把资产阶级教育制度那一套，来个大翻个。”这个学校有几个特点：
    第一，一切方便贫下中农。
    过去有一件事使贫下中农非常气愤。有一次，被一小撮走资派所统治的十七中学招收新生，一个贫农的儿子考分已经超过了录取标准不予录取；却把和他们有私人关系的一个学生考卷提高三十五分拉入了学校。农中一建立，贫下中农就把大权紧紧掌握在自己手里。他们选出突出政治、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的党支部书记王兴同志当校长，组成有民兵营长、老贫农和革命师生参加的校委会，贫下中农成了学校的主人。农业中学成立以后，招收新生和十七中截然不同，凡是贫下中农子女要求入学的，不受年龄限制，不经考试，不收学费，经校委会批准即可入学。其他诸如选用教员、课程设置、修建校舍、毕业生分配等重大事项都由校委会讨论决定而后实行。
    第二，砸碎“智育第一”、“分数挂帅”的精神枷锁，以活学活用毛主席著作为主课，以阶级斗争实际为教材。
    把持十七中的一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子，竭力鼓吹“智育第一”，“分数挂帅”，疯狂压制和破坏学生活学活用毛主席著作。贫下中农对此无比愤慨，他们针锋相对，在自己的农中把毛主席著作列为主课，新生入学发给的第一本书就是金光闪闪的《毛泽东著作选读（乙种本）》，农中开学的第一堂课，就是学《为人民服务》；老贫农经常在田间、地头、校内校外对学生进行阶级教育。他们向学生指出：“贫下中农办学校，不是要你们的高分数，要的是你们的高思想，有了毛泽东思想就有了为人民服务的本事。”他们把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在高于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，经常举办各种类型的讲用会，以“老三篇”为武器，“斗私，批修”。学校课程设置“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。”紧密结合三大革命运动，贫下中农需要什么知识，他们就开设什么课程，发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，把农村广阔天地当做课堂。数学课经常进行现场教学，学生亲自丈量土地，计算粪堆、粮仓的体积和容量。学校建立了试验田，为生产队培育良种，使学生掌握农业生产技术。学校还建立民兵组织，在大队民兵营的领导下，学习解放军的四个第一，三八作风，经常开展军事训练。学校积极开展革命大批判和对敌斗争，革命师生先后写出批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内走资派的文章一百多篇。
    第三，实行教育与生产劳动相结合，培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。为了使学生保持贫下中农勤劳朴素的本色，不沾染资产阶级习气，农中根据贫下中农的意见，经校委会讨论定了几条：（一）学生来校一律不准骑“洋车”、吸烟、打扑克和玩棋罗；（二）学生上下学一律背粪筐拣粪；（三）不放寒暑假，放春耕、夏锄、秋收三大农忙假，学生与社员一起参加生产劳动；（四）学生每人每年至少参加集体劳动九十天，用自己的劳动收入领回个人的口粮；（五）通过生产劳动改造思想，每个农事季节都要写一次思想总结。每当农忙时节，那个生产队有困难，他们就赶到那里去支援。一九六六年春旱，于家围子生产队六十垧苞米没出苗，他们闻讯赶到，突击两天完成了补种任务，没有违误农时。四年来，农中学生除自己动手修建十五间校舍外，帮助二十多个生产队劳动一百多次，做了十万多个劳动日，拣二百多车优质肥。他们在生产队里劳动，早出晚归，不计较报酬。学生王成富毕业第二天，就参加了生产队的集体劳动。他高兴地对干部和贫下中农说：“我念书的目的，就是为了做毛泽东思想的宣传员，当个新式农民，现在我的理想实现了。”在农中一九六八年首届三十四名毕业生中，除了两名光荣地参加了中国人民解放军外，其余的都愉快地回到生产队当了新式农民，成为三大革命运动中的骨干，当上了活学活用毛泽东思想辅导员，有两名被选为民兵排长，有一名被选为县的学习毛主席著作积极分子。贫下中农夸赞说：“这些学生能文能武能劳动，拿笔会写文章，下地能种田，持枪能战斗，登上讲台就宣传，是农村的多面手，是革命的好接班人，把孩子送进这样的学校咱真是一百个放心。”
    第四，把资产阶级知识分子拉下马，贫下中农登上讲台，教师既是教育者又是劳动者。
    农中请有三大革命实践经验的大队干部、民兵干部、老贫农、复员军人和经过劳动锻炼的农村知识青年做教师。大队党支部书记既是这个学校的校长又是政治课教师，他经常给学生作学习毛主席著作辅导报告，针对学生的活思想进行政治思想工作。老贫农经常到学校向学生讲“三史”，进行阶级教育；民兵营长和复员军人担任军事课教师，向学生讲作战常识，进行军事训练；农业技术员担任农业技术课教员，向学生讲农业知识。担任文化课教师的农村知识青年，既教书又劳动，每年至少参加九十天集体劳动，他们的报酬不超过中上等劳动力的工分标准，在生产队参加分配。
    在两条路线斗争中阔步前进
    太平岭农中从旧教育制度下冲杀出来以后，旗帜鲜明，以彻底革命的姿态，向资产阶级教育路线猛烈开火。公社党委内和十七中党内的一小撮走资派对农中采取“以攻为守”的策略，企图用腐朽的资产阶级思想侵蚀这所新型学校。他们百般吹嘘“正规化”、
  “质量高”，诬蔑农业中学“不正规、质量低、教不出好学生”。社会上的阶级敌人，也一呼一应，说什么“农中学生是‘中学漏子’不成气”，“兔子尾巴长不了”。农中的同志认识到这是一场两种思想、两条路线的尖锐斗争，他们反复学习了《为人民服务》和毛主席有关教育革命的指示，开展了一场“为什么而教”“为什么而学”的大讨论，掀起一个破私立公的思想革命化热潮。教师们很有感受地说：“旧学校的‘正规化’就是资产阶级化，旧学校的‘质量高’就是让‘私’字拔高，咱们决不能上它的圈套！”学生们说：
  “我们办学是白手起家，桌子自己搭，凳子自己拿，这种‘穷棒子精神’最光荣！”
    农中在斗争中显示了强大的生命力和无比的优越性，深受贫下中农的欢迎。附近六个大队的贫下中农纷纷送子女来入学。农中不到一年，就从一个班迅速发展到六个班，声望越来越高。但是，阶级敌人并不甘心他们的失败，公社党内一小撮走资派凭着窃踞的党政大权，罢了农中校长的官，把敢于同他们作斗争的教师叫做“捣乱分子”，横加打击；勒令反对他们的学生退学，怂恿他们安插在农中的“负责人”，勾结来历不清的人建立一座黑铁匠炉，开起“地下工厂”，生产农村根本不需要的产品搞投机生意，一时把农中搞得乌烟瘴气。广大贫下中农和农中的革命师生，顶着资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的支持下，奋起反击，终于把公社和十七中的一小撮走资派揪了出来，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。
    太平岭农中，经过四年战斗的岁月，现在在毛主席无产阶级教育路线指引下，路子越走越宽广。
