The U.S. imperialists, through their puppet regime of Balaguer that they have personally nurtured in the Dominican Republic, have carried out frenzied economic plunder and exploitation of the Dominican Republic. The U.S. imperialists are the most vicious enemies of the Dominican people.

Under the various favorable conditions provided by the Balaguer sell-out regime, U.S. monopoly capitalists have accelerated their infiltration into the Dominican Republic. American enterprises have successively set up factories there. In April of this year, the Balaguer regime issued the so-called "Industrial Stimulation Law," greatly reducing the import tariffs on machinery, equipment, raw materials, and fuels needed for setting up factories, thus opening wide the gates for the accelerated infiltration of U.S. monopoly capitalists.

U.S. monopoly capitalists have also tightened their control over the mining and agricultural production of the Dominican Republic. The American Falconbridge Company and other monopoly groups have been extensively mining nickel, tin, iron ore, chromium, and cobalt and other precious minerals in the Dominican Republic in recent years. The American Transco Casting Company has obtained the mining rights for manganese and copper over an area of 29,000 hectares of land; the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company has obtained the mining rights for salt; the Alcoa Mining Company, which has been established in the Dominican Republic since 1959, mined 100 million tons of bauxite last year alone.

U.S. monopoly capitalists have seized a large amount of land. In order to intensify the exploitation of the Dominican people and transfer their own economic crises, these monopoly groups often do not provide the funds for their investments themselves, but rather have the Dominican Republic bear the burden. For example, the American Nebraska-Aguirre Company recently signed a contract to obtain a piece of land worth $18 million in the northwestern part of the Dominican Republic. After the contract was signed, the Dominican government immediately provided this company with $1.5 million for sowing. The American company, Dominican Fruit Company, located in the south of the Dominican Republic, also recently obtained a loan of $400,000 from the Dominican authorities. Currently, the American Agricultural Development Company is plotting to seize 414,000 acres of land in the Yaque Valley of the Dominican Republic.

The U.S. imperialists' frenzied plunder has made the economic situation of the Dominican Republic worse and worse. The agricultural production of the Dominican Republic decreased by half last year, resulting in an unprecedented shortage of grain and other foodstuffs, soaring living costs, the bankruptcy of a large number of farmers, and the broad masses of laboring people struggling on the brink of starvation.

    掠夺又掠夺　压榨再压榨
    美国垄断资本疯狂侵入多米尼加
    据新华社讯　美帝国主义通过它在多米尼加一手扶植的巴拉格尔傀儡政权，对多米尼加进行了疯狂的经济掠夺和压榨，美帝国主义是多米尼加人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    在巴拉格尔卖国政权所提供的各种便利条件下，美国垄断资本加紧渗入多米尼加，美国企业纷纷在多米尼加开设工厂。今年四月，巴拉格尔政权又颁布了所谓的“工业刺激法律”，大大减少开设工厂所需要的机器、设备、原料和燃料等的进口关税，为美国垄断资本的加速渗透大开方便之门。
    美国垄断资本还加紧控制多米尼加的矿业和农业生产。美国法尔康布里季公司和其他垄断集团近几年来一直在多米尼加大量开采镍、锡、铁矿石、铬、钴等贵重矿藏。美国特拉尼铸造公司取得了两万九千公顷土地的锰和铜的开采权；匹兹堡金属板公司取得了盐的开采权；从一九五九年就在多米尼加建立的阿尔考开采公司，在去年一年中就开采了一百万吨的铁矾土。
    美国垄断资本霸占了大量土地。为了加紧剥削多米尼加人民，转嫁自身的经济危机，这些垄断集团用于投资的经费往往不是由它们自己提供，而是由多米尼加来负担。例如，美国内布拉斯卡—阿吉雷公司最近通过签订合同获得多米尼加西北部一块价值一千八百万美元的土地，合同签订后，多米尼加政府就给这一家公司提供了一百五十万美元作为播种的经费。位于多米尼加南部的美国公司——多米尼加水果公司最近也从多米尼加当局获得四十万美元的贷款。目前，美国农业开发公司正阴谋霸占位于多米尼加亚克山谷的四十一万四千英亩的土地。
    美帝国主义的疯狂掠夺使多米尼加的经济状况越来越糟。多米尼加的农业生产在去年一年中就减产了一半，这造成粮食和其他食品的空前缺乏，生活费用不断上涨，大批农民遭到破产，广大劳动人民挣扎在饥饿线上。
