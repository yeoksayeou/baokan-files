In the midst of a new upsurge in the struggle to criticize and repudiate the old and establish the new, and with revolutionary and production victories being reported from all over the country, the coal industry has brought forth another piece of heartening news: a large modern coal mine with a unique Chinese style and an annual production capacity of several hundred thousand tons—Xingtai Coal Mine—has recently been put into production.

The Xingtai mine is a large vertical shaft mine designed, constructed, and equipped entirely by China. From mining and transportation to hoisting, the entire production process is mechanized. The coal is of high quality, making it excellent for industrial use. After trial production, all construction and installation work fully met quality standards. The commissioning of Xingtai Coal Mine marks a new development in China's coal mine construction technology.

The completion of the Xingtai mine is a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary workers who participated in the mine's construction, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, displayed the daring spirit of the proletarian revolution, and launched a fierce critique of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the coal industry. They broke through the foreign frameworks and insisted on following the path of self-reliance and hard struggle as indicated by Chairman Mao. Despite having no data or models to refer to, they overcame numerous difficulties and achieved victory. A 10-meter-thick layer of quicksand, unprecedented in China's drilling history and rare even abroad, was successfully dealt with. Liu Shaoqi's agents in the coal industry had brought in some bourgeois technical "authorities" from other units to handle this project, but they only wasted a large amount of state resources and left behind a mess.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most capable are those who have the most practical experience." The experienced mine construction workers, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao and his proletarian revolutionary line, and a strong sense of revolutionary responsibility, broke through one obstacle after another. They successfully carried out more than 100 technological innovations and completed this project.

At the national coal industry conference held in May, the mine's workers' representatives were twice fortunate enough to be received by our great leader Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms. Chairman Mao's warm concern greatly inspired the revolutionary workers. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the engineering department, they resolutely implemented the resolutions of the national coal industry conference, conducted in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and ensured that revolution guided production. Both revolution and production have entered a new phase, significantly accelerating the construction progress.

### 革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗走自力更生道路  邢台大型现代化煤矿投入生产

    革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗走自力更生道路
    邢台大型现代化煤矿投入生产
    据新华社石家庄十二日电　在全国掀起斗、批、改的新高潮，革命、生产捷报频传的大好形势下，我国煤炭工业战线又传来了一个振奋人心的喜讯：具有我国煤矿建井独特风格、年产数十万吨的大型现代化矿井——邢台煤矿，已在最近正式投入生产。
    邢台矿井是由我国自己设计、自己施工、自己装备的大型竖井。从采掘、运输到提升，整个生产过程完全是机械化的。煤质优良，是很好的工业用煤。经过试产，所有建筑、安装工程完全符合质量要求。邢台煤矿的投入生产，标志着我国煤矿建井技术有了新的发展。
    邢台矿井的建成，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。参加矿井建设的广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬敢想、敢干的无产阶级革命精神，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤炭部门的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，冲破洋框框，坚持走毛主席指引的自力更生、艰苦奋斗的道路，在一无资料、二无样板可借鉴的情况下，克服重重困难，夺得了胜利。十米厚的流沙层，这在我国凿井史上是史无前例的，在国外也是少见的。中国赫鲁晓夫在煤矿部门的代理人曾从外单位调来一些资产阶级技术“权威”来负责这项工程，结果这些人白白浪费了国家大量资材，只留下一个烂摊子。
    毛主席教导说：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”有着丰富实践经验的建井工人，凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的红心和高度的革命责任感，突破一道道难关，成功地进行了一百多项技术革新，圆满地完成了这项工程。
    在今年五月召开的全国煤炭工业会议上，矿井的工人代表两次幸福地受到了我们的伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的亲密战友林副主席的接见。毛主席的亲切关怀，极大地鼓舞了广大革命职工。他们在工程处革命委员会的领导下，坚决贯彻全国煤炭工业会议的决议，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，坚持以革命统帅生产，推动革命和生产都出现了新局面，大大加快了施工进度。
