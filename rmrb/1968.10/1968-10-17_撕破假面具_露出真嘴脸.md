The Soviet revisionist clique has always pretended to be the "friend" of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, hypocritically claiming to "firmly support the national liberation movements and struggles for freedom and independence of all peoples." However, they have repeatedly torn off their own masks with their own hands, revealing their anti-people, counter-revolutionary ugly faces. The farce staged by the Soviet revisionists in Moscow on the 14th, aimed at disrupting the demonstration by Latin American students, is yet another self-exposure.

Recently, Mexican students, fearless of violence, have launched a massive struggle against oppression and massacre across the country, targeting U.S. imperialism and its agents in Mexico. This is a just revolutionary action. It has received the support of students and youth in Latin American countries and the broad revolutionary people of the world. Latin American students in the Soviet Union holding demonstrations to support the Mexican student movement is entirely justified. However, the Soviet revisionist clique dispatched a large number of police and secret agents to intervene brutally, unreasonably obstructing the students' march to the Mexican Embassy in the Soviet Union. This fully shows that the Soviet revisionist clique is in cahoots with imperialism and reactionaries.

Suppressing and crushing revolutionary mass movements is nothing new for the Soviet revisionists. Three years ago, they dispatched more than 700 armed military and police to attack over 2,000 Asian, African, and Latin American students who were demonstrating in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. This time, they are just repeating the same tricks.

It is worth noting that when the Soviet revisionists invaded Czechoslovakia a few days ago, the people in some reactionary countries in Latin America and other regions held protests and demonstrations, which were obstructed and suppressed by the reactionary authorities. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique is using the same methods to deal with Latin American students in the Soviet Union who are supporting the Mexican student movement. Isn't it clear what kind of relationship the Soviet revisionists have with the reactionaries of various countries?

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." The Soviet revisionist clique is a genuine counter-revolutionary who stands on the side of imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries. This bunch of Soviet revisionists not only fraternize with U.S. imperialism but also have close ties with Suharto and Rahman of Asia, Mobutu of Africa, and many U.S. lackeys in Latin America. It is clear that the Soviet revisionists' disruption of the demonstration by Latin American students in the Soviet Union is both out of their reactionary class instincts and to curry favor with the Mexican reactionary government and its U.S. masters.

Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Those supported by imperialism are precisely those despised by the broad masses of the people." The Soviet revisionist clique has degenerated into social imperialism, so it treats those despised by the peoples of various countries as friends, giving them full support, and treats the revolutionary masses of various countries, who are hated by the reactionaries, as enemies, suppressing them with all their might. This is not surprising.

However, the Soviet revisionists' various reactionary acts can only continuously expose their reactionary nature as enemies of the peoples of various countries, thereby promoting the struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. There can be no other result.

    撕破假面具  露出真嘴脸
    苏修叛徒集团一贯装扮成亚非拉人民的“朋友”，假惺惺地表示“坚决支持各国人民的民族解放运动、要求自由和独立的运动”。但是他们却不断用自己的双手撕破自己的假面具，露出其反人民、反革命的丑恶嘴脸。苏修叛徒十四日在莫斯科演出的一出破坏拉丁美洲留学生游行示威的丑剧，就是他们的又一次自我暴露。
    最近墨西哥学生不畏强暴，在全国掀起了声势浩大的反迫害、反屠杀的斗争，矛头指向美帝国主义及其在墨西哥的代理人。这是正义的革命行动。它得到了拉丁美洲各国学生和青年以及全世界广大革命人民的支持。拉丁美洲留苏学生举行游行示威声援墨西哥的学生运动，完全是天经地义的。然而，苏修叛徒集团竟出动大批警察特务，蛮横地加以干预，无理阻拦学生向墨西哥驻苏大使馆行进。这充分表明，苏修叛徒集团是同帝国主义和反动派一个鼻孔出气的。
    破坏和镇压革命群众运动，对于苏修来说，已经不是什么新鲜的事情。三年前，他们就曾经出动七百多名武装军警，对为支援越南人民抗美救国斗争而举行游行示威的两千多名亚非拉留学生下毒手。这一次不过是重施故技罢了。
    耐人寻味的是，前些日子苏修出兵侵占捷克斯洛伐克的时候，在拉丁美洲和其他地区一些反动派当权的国家中人民群众举行抗议示威，就曾经遭到反动当局的阻拦和镇压，现在苏修叛徒集团又采取同样的手段来对待声援墨西哥学生运动的拉丁美洲留学生。苏修叛徒同各国反动派之间是一种什么样的关系，这不是很清楚了吗？
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”苏修叛徒集团正是同帝国主义和各国反动派站在一边的地地道道的反革命派。这伙苏修叛徒不仅同美帝国主义称兄道弟，而且同亚洲的苏哈托、拉赫曼，非洲的蒙博托以及拉丁美洲的许多美帝走狗，都打得火热。很清楚，苏修这次破坏拉丁美洲留苏学生的示威游行，既是出于它的反动阶级本能，也是为了讨好墨西哥反动政权及其美国主子。
    毛主席曾经指出：“帝国主义所支持的人，正是广大人民所唾弃的人。”苏修叛徒集团已堕落成为社会帝国主义，因此它把各国人民所唾弃的反动派引为知己，拚命给以支持，把各国反动派所仇视的革命人民群众看作仇敌，竭力进行镇压，这是毫不奇怪的。
    但是，苏修的种种倒行逆施，除了只能不断暴露自己与各国人民为敌的反动面目，从而促使世界各国革命人民加强反对美帝和苏修的斗争之外，是不可能有什么其他结果的。
