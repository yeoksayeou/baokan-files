Once, the water pipes supplying water to Guangxi University ruptured in two places, causing the entire school to lose water. Shortly before this, some students at Guangxi University had disagreements with the water plant workers due to differing viewpoints, leading to conflicts. In this situation, should the water pipes be repaired or not? If one were to act from a bourgeois standpoint and consider factional interests, the decision might be not to repair them. However, the old workers at the water plant, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the deepest understanding and closest adherence to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "One must advocate considering the overall situation," and firmly stated: The revolutionary teachers and students of Guangxi University are our class brothers. We should consider the overall situation and prioritize revolutionary interests, solving their water supply difficulties. Not repairing the water pipes for them does not align with Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever does not align with Mao Zedong Thought, we, the working class, will resolutely not do. Thus, a repair team led by old workers immediately set out.

The majority of the repair work was carried out in a pond over a meter deep. The workers and soldiers jumped into the water, chest-high and sometimes over their heads, to drive piles, build dams, and drain water. When they were tired and exhausted, they recited Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," to encourage and inspire themselves. Communist Party member and pipe installer, Yan Banghui, suffered stomach pain due to prolonged immersion in water. Comrades urged him to rest on the shore, but he said, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'What is work? Work is struggle.' Struggle is arduous but also glorious. In the dictionary of the working class, there are no words 'fear hardship.'" He endured the pain and continued working in the deep water. Communist Party member and truck driver, Li Shengxin, in addition to completing the task of transporting personnel and equipment, always found time to participate in underwater operations. To solve technical difficulties in the repair process and restore water supply as soon as possible, Chen Guozhou, who had just returned from an out-of-town project, and Liu Changfu, a semi-retired master, also rushed to the site upon hearing the news. They worked together with everyone, day and night, without rest.

After three days and nights of hard work, the water pipes were finally repaired. The water supply for the teachers and students of Guangxi University was ensured. The working class, with their broad-mindedness and selflessness, their revolutionary spirit of enduring hardships and persevering, educated the revolutionary teachers and students of Guangxi University. They expressed their determination to learn humbly from the noble qualities of the working class, strengthen the unity between workers and students, and, under the leadership of the working class, carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform in schools, pushing the educational revolution to the end.

    工人阶级的胸怀
    一次，专供广西大学用水的水管有两处破裂，全校都断了供水。在这不久前，广西大学的部分学生，由于观点不同，曾经和水厂工人发生过矛盾。在这种情况下，修不修水管？要是从资产阶级的派性出发，就会作出不修的决定。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的水厂老工人，对毛主席的革命路线理解最深，跟得最紧。他们学习了毛主席“要提倡顾全大局”的教导，坚决表示：广西大学的广大革命师生是我们的阶级兄弟。我们应该从全局出发，以革命利益为重，给他们解决用水的困难。不给他们修理水管，这不符合毛泽东思想。凡是不符合毛泽东思想的事，我们工人阶级坚决不干。于是，一支以老工人为骨干的抢修组立刻出发了。
    抢修的绝大部分作业，是在一米多深的水塘中进行的。工人们和解放军一个个争先恐后地跳入水中，在齐胸、没头的深水中打桩、筑坝和排水。累了困了，就背诵毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导来鞭策鼓舞自己。共产党员、管道安装工人严邦辉，由于长时间泡在水里，肚子疼痛起来。同志们劝他上岸休息，他说：“毛主席教导我们：‘什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。’斗争是艰苦的，也是光荣的。在工人阶级的词典里，就没有‘怕苦’两个字。”他一直忍着病痛，坚持在深水中作业。共产党员、汽车司机李声信，除了完成运送人员和器材的任务外，总是挤时间参加水下作业。为了解决抢修中的技术难题，早日恢复供水，支援外地工程刚返回来的陈国潮和已经半休的刘长蔚老师傅，也闻讯赶到工地，和大家一道，不分白天黑夜地奋战。
    经过三天三夜的苦战，终于把水管修好了。广西大学师生的用水得到了保证。工人阶级以革命利益为重、大公无私的宽广胸怀，工人阶级吃大苦、耐大劳，艰苦奋斗的革命精神，教育了广西大学的革命师生。他们纷纷表示：要虚心学习工人阶级的高贵品质，加强工人和学生之间的团结，在工人阶级领导下，搞好学校的斗、批、改，把教育革命进行到底。             　颂东
