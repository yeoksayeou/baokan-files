Title: In Praise of the Red Spearhead Platoon

The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" passionately praises a spearhead platoon led by Yang Weicai, the reconnaissance platoon leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

This spearhead platoon firmly remembers the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, carries forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and with the help of the Korean people, penetrates deep into the enemy's heart, causing the command center of the American puppet "White Tiger Regiment" to be in utter chaos, with people and horses falling over.

This is a red spearhead platoon, this is a spearhead platoon armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

"Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" and other revolutionary model operas are also red spearhead platoons—the red spearhead platoons on the cultural front. Indeed:

	The spearhead platoon of the reconnaissance platoon,
	The spearhead flies into the White Tiger Regiment!
	Kick through all difficulties and dangers,
	Pave the way to victory smoothly...
	The spearhead dances, the blade glistens,
	Revolutionary soldiers think in unison—
	Are not the eight revolutionary model operas red spearhead platoons?!

	Emperors and generals are slashed with one stroke,
	Ghosts and monsters are beheaded with one stroke.
	Workers, peasants, and soldiers stand firm on the cultural front,
	Defend the red mountains for ten thousand years.
	Soldiers praise revolutionary model operas.

    “红色尖刀班”赞
    解放军某部　孙春亭
    革命现代京剧《奇袭白虎团》，热情地歌颂了由中国人民志愿军侦察排长杨伟才率领的一个尖刀班。
    这个尖刀班，牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，发扬无产阶级的国际主义精神，在朝鲜人民的协助下，插入敌人心脏，把美伪军“白虎团”的指挥机关搞得个天翻地覆，人仰马翻。
    这是一个红色尖刀班，这是一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的尖刀班！
    《奇袭白虎团》和其他几个革命样板戏，也都是红色尖刀班——文艺战线上的红色尖刀班。正是：
        侦察排的尖刀班，
        尖刀飞插白虎团！
        千难万险一脚踢，
        胜利道路铺平坦……
        尖刀舞啊刀光闪，
        革命战士想联翩——
        八个革命样板戏，岂不是红色尖刀班！？
　　    帝王将相一刀挑，
        牛鬼蛇神一刀斩。
        工农兵屹立文艺阵地，
        捍卫江山红万年。
