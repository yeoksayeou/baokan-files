Arab governments and media outlets have issued statements and comments, strongly condemning the recent U.S. imperialist plan to supply its tool of aggression, Israel, with a batch of supersonic fighter-bombers. This move is aimed at further invading Arab countries and massacring the Arab people.

According to reports, U.S. President Johnson announced on the 9th that he had authorized U.S. Secretary of State Rusk to negotiate with Israeli authorities to provide Israel with a batch of U.S. supersonic "Phantom" fighter-bombers. Prior to this, the U.S. Congress passed a so-called "Foreign Assistance Authorization Act," openly stating that the U.S. should provide Israel with these aircraft to "ensure that Israel has a sufficient deterrent force."

According to the Syrian Arab News Agency, the Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman stated in Damascus on the 10th: "The U.S. government's announcement of its intention to provide Israel with the latest aggressive and destructive weapons once again confirms the already obvious fact that without the unconditional support of the U.S., the imperialist aggression by Zionists against the Arab nation on June 5, 1967, would not have occurred."

The statement said that the Syrian Arab Republic's Foreign Ministry strongly condemns the U.S. government's new act of aggression against the Arab people. The statement pointed out that providing aircraft to the Israeli aggressors occupying Arab territories can only be seen as inciting further aggression.

The Damascus Radio broadcasted a commentary on the evening of the 12th: "This move by the U.S. is a step to escalate the Middle East crisis and exposes the imperialist and Zionist expansionist aggression. It also exposes the hypocrisy of the U.S. and Zionists' claim to seek a so-called peaceful solution to the problems caused by imperialist and Zionist aggression against the Arab nation."

The radio said: "U.S. imperialists and Israeli aggressors are accustomed to using the lie of claiming they hope for peace to justify their aggressive plots, but the bitter experience of the Arab people is enough to expose these evil aggressive plots."

The radio concluded: "The Arab masses must utilize all their potential to strengthen the activities of the commando units and develop these activities into a people's liberation war, because this is the only way to counter imperialist plots, prevent them from succeeding, and liberate the occupied lands."

The Syrian "Revolution" newspaper commented on the 12th: People who love peace and justice around the world will increasingly realize that Israel is just a tool of world imperialism, and the struggle of the Arab people is not only against Israeli Zionists but also against the leader of the imperialist world, the U.S.

The Egyptian "Al-Ahram" newspaper also commented on the 12th: "This action by the U.S. is not surprising to Arab countries. Everyone knows the role the U.S. plays behind Israel and the various strategies and tactics it uses in this regard. When deception fails, it resorts to force and aggression, which is the consistent method of imperialism."

### 阿拉伯国家政府和舆论分别发表声明和评论  强烈谴责美帝给以色列武器屠杀阿拉伯人民  对付帝国主义、解放被占领土地的唯一办法是发展人民解放战争

    阿拉伯国家政府和舆论分别发表声明和评论
    强烈谴责美帝给以色列武器屠杀阿拉伯人民
    对付帝国主义、解放被占领土地的唯一办法是发展人民解放战争
    据新华社十三日讯　阿拉伯国家的政府和报纸、电台，连日分别发表声明和评论，强烈谴责美帝国主义最近准备向它的侵略工具以色列提供一批超音速战斗轰炸机，以便进一步侵略阿拉伯国家、屠杀阿拉伯人民的罪行。
    据报道，美国总统约翰逊在九日曾公开发表声明说，他已授权美国国务卿腊斯克同以色列当局举行“谈判”，以便向以色列提供一批美国超音速“鬼怪式”战斗轰炸机。在这之前，美国国会通过一项所谓“对外援助授权法案”，公然宣称美国应向以色列提供这种飞机，“使以色列有一支充分的威慑力量”。
    据阿拉伯叙利亚通讯社报道，叙利亚外交部发言人十日在大马士革发表声明说：“美国政府宣布打算向以色列提供最新式的侵略和破坏性武器，这再次证实已经明摆着的事实，即如果没有美国的无条件支持，一九六七年六月五日犹太复国主义者对阿拉伯民族的帝国主义侵略，本来是不会发生的。”
    声明说，阿拉伯叙利亚共和国外交部宣布强烈谴责美国政府对阿拉伯人民的这一新的侵略行动。声明指出，美国向霸占着阿拉伯领土的以色列侵略者提供飞机，只能被认为是煽动进一步的侵略。
    大马士革电台十二日晚上广播一篇评论说：美国这种做法“是使中东危机加剧的一个步骤，并且暴露了帝国主义和犹太复国主义进行扩张的侵略图谋。这也暴露了美国和犹太复国主义者关于要对帝国主义和犹太复国主义侵略阿拉伯民族造成的问题实行所谓和平解决的说法，是虚伪的。”
    电台说：“美帝国主义者和以色列侵略者惯于用声称他们希望和平的谎话，为他们的侵略图谋辩解，但是我们阿拉伯人民的惨痛经验足以揭露这些罪恶的侵略图谋。”
    电台最后说：“阿拉伯群众必须利用自己的全部潜力增强突击队的活动，并把这种活动发展成人民解放战争，因为这是对付帝国主义阴谋，使它们不能得逞，并解放被占领的土地的唯一办法。”
    叙利亚《革命报》十二日发表的评论说：爱好和平和主持正义的各国人民必将日益确信，以色列只是世界帝国主义的一个工具，阿拉伯人民的战斗不仅是抗击以色列犹太复国主义者，而且也是抗击帝国主义世界的头子美国。
    阿联《金字塔报》十二日也就这件事发表的社论说：“美国这一行动对阿拉伯国家来说并不是意外的。谁都了解美国在以色列背后所起的作用，谁都知道美国在这方面使用的变化多端的策略和手法。骗人不成，就采用武力和侵略，这是帝国主义的一贯手法。”
