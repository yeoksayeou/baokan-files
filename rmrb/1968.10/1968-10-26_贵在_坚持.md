In a Mao Zedong Thought study class, comrades were enthusiastically sharing their experiences of overcoming the "labor hurdle." At this moment, a young cadre with thick glasses and a radiant spirit stood up and said:

"I am a cadre from Sanmen. My experience boils down to the two characters 'persist.' The more difficult the times, the more we must persist. Persistence leads to victory!" These few concise and powerful words immediately received everyone's unanimous approval. This young man was named Jie Dengming.

Where did Comrade Jie's insight come from?

The first task upon entering the site was to clear land and plant sweet potatoes. The team entered Fuju Gorge, where "the soil is like pearls and the water is like oil, with large rocks all over the mountains." Jie thought to himself: Could it be that the old platoon leader led us astray? How can we till this land? Upon arrival, without saying a word, he picked up a hoe and started working. Thud, after one swing of the hoe, all he saw was a white mark. Soon, he was sweating profusely, his hands were blistered, and he could no longer continue. At this moment, the old platoon leader walked over and patted his shoulder affectionately, saying, "Jie, I see you're tired. Come, take a rest!" As soon as Jie put down the hoe, his legs began to tremble, and he sat down on the ground. At that moment, a thought arose in his mind: Can I pass this labor hurdle? After this thought flashed through his mind, he looked up and saw that dozens of comrades around him were working diligently, while he was the only one sitting in the middle of the ground, which was really embarrassing. That night, back in the dormitory, Jie was still pondering this question. He recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "Persistence leads to victory!" A golden key opened the lock in Jie's heart: To transform old thinking, one must persist.

From then on, Jie constantly used the two characters "persist" to urge himself on.

When installing power poles on the 500-meter-high "Sky Peak," Jie took on the task of drilling holes. By the time he reached the top, he was drenched in sweat, and swinging the eight-pound hammer left him breathless. At this moment, Jie shouted, "Persistence leads to victory!" After fighting for seven hours, he completed the task.

When building houses in the camp, Jie led everyone up the mountain to chop trees. His clothes were torn, his hands were injured, and he had to carry hundreds of beams down the mountain. His strength was almost gone. What should he do? Jie again used "Persistence leads to victory" as his driving force and overcame this hurdle.

Thus, under the scorching sun, in the wind and rain, when blisters burst, he persisted; when his shoulders were swollen, he persisted; when he was so tired that he could no longer stand, he persisted again. After more than five months of unyielding training, his face was tanned, his body was strong, his hands were calloused, and his heart was even redder. In the study class, Jie excitedly declared: "I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, persist forever, and thoroughly transform myself through hard labor."

    贵在“坚持”
    在毛泽东思想学习班上，同志们你一言，我一语，正在热情洋溢地交流着闯越“劳动关”的经验。这时，一个戴着深度近视眼镜、精神焕发的青年干部，站起来说道：
  “我是三门干部，我的体会就是‘坚持’二字，越是艰苦的时候，越是要坚持，坚持下去就是胜利！”简短有力的几句话，顿时得到了大家的一致赞同。这青年叫郜登明。
    小郜的这个体会，从何得来？
    进场的第一课是开荒种山药。队伍进了“土如珍珠水如油，满山遍野大石头”的兑臼沟，小郜边走边想：莫非老班长领错了路？这个地怎么个刨法？一到目的地，他二话不说抡起镢头就干起来，嗵，一镢刨下去只见一个白印印，不一会累得满头大汗，两手磨起血泡，实在刨不动了。这时老班长走过来亲切地拍着他的肩膀说：“小郜呀！我看你是累了吧。来！歇歇吧！”小郜镢头一离手，两腿就发颤，一屁股坐在地上，这时一个念头从心底涌起：这艰苦的劳动关我能不能过去？念头闪过之后，抬头一看，周围几十个同志都在紧张地劳动着，唯独自己坐在这地中心，实在不象样子。晚上，回到宿舍，小郜还在思索着这个问题，他想起了毛主席的教导：“坚持下去就是胜利”！一把金钥匙，打开了小郜的心头锁：要改造旧思想就得坚持。
    从此，小郜时刻用“坚持”二字鞭策自己。
    往高达五百多米的“摩天岭”上安装电杆，小郜担当了打眼凿坑任务，爬到顶峰已是汗流浃背，再抡八磅大锤已是气喘嘘嘘。这时小郜高喊着“坚持下去就是胜利”！奋战七小时完成了任务。
    场里修建房屋，小郜带大家上山砍树。他的衣服撕破了，手扎破了，又要把几百根的檩条扛下山来，力气实在支不住了，怎么办？小郜又以“坚持下去就是胜利”作动力，闯过了这一关。
    就这样，在烈日下，在风雨中，血泡磨破了坚持一下，肩膀压肿了坚持一下，实在累得支不住了再坚持一下。经过五个多月坚持不断的磨练，脸膛晒黑了，身体壮实了，两手结茧了，心也更红了。在学习班上，小郜激动地表示：“我一定遵照毛主席的教导，永远坚持下去，在艰苦劳动中彻底改造自己。”
