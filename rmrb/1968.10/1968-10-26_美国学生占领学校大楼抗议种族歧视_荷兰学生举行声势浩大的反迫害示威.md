	American Students Occupy School Buildings to Protest Racial Discrimination; Dutch Students Hold Massive Anti-Persecution Protest

	Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: Washington reports that students from the University of California, Berkeley, in Berkeley, California, have occupied two school buildings in recent days to protest the school administration's racial discrimination against blacks.

	Under pressure from a broad student population, the University of California initially agreed to offer a course titled "Racism in America" this semester. However, the reactionary school administration then abruptly canceled this course, sparking strong indignation among the students.

	On the evening of the 22nd, over 120 students, with the support of a broad student population, occupied the school's administrative building. When the reactionary school administration sent a large number of campus police to arrest these students, about 2,500 students rushed to the scene, guarding the occupied building and engaging in a face-to-face struggle with the campus police.

	Following this, on the evening of the 23rd, another 150 students, with the support of 2,000 students, occupied another building in the school to protest the school administration's discrimination against blacks and suppression of students. On the 24th, the reactionary ruling authorities in the United States even dispatched over 500 police from the San Francisco Bay area to brutally suppress and mass-arrest the students. At this time, the students guarding the building outside picked up stones to retaliate. The struggle of the University of California students is continuing to develop.

	Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: Amsterdam reports that following the demonstration of several hundred students on the 22nd, about 4,000 Dutch students held an even larger demonstration in Amsterdam on the evening of the 24th to protest the reactionary authorities' persecution of 15 Dutch students. The demonstrators also strongly supported the Mexican students' just struggle against persecution and protested against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

	Despite the reactionary city authorities' ban, the students marched from their schools to the city center. The frightened reactionary authorities dispatched a large number of fully armed police to brutally suppress the demonstrators. The demonstrators bravely retaliated and then dispersed throughout the city to continue their demonstrations. During the demonstration, students threw stones at the police. Some students also demonstrated near the police headquarters, causing the panicked reactionary authorities to dispatch all police mobile units to protect the headquarters.

	The demonstration lasted about five hours. Some student leaders stated on the evening of the 24th that Amsterdam students will continue their struggle in the future. (Accompanied by a photograph)

    美国学生占领学校大楼抗议种族歧视  荷兰学生举行声势浩大的反迫害示威
    新华社二十五日讯  华盛顿消息：美国加利福尼亚州伯克利市加利福尼亚大学的学生，最近几天内连续两次占领了这个学校的两座大楼，抗议学校当局对黑人的种族歧视。
    在广大学生群众的压力下，加利福尼亚大学这学期初曾答应开设一门叫“美国的种族主义”的课程。但是这个学校的反动当局接着又悍然取消了这门课程。这就引起了这个学校广大学生的强烈愤慨。
    二十二日晚上，这个学校的一百二十余名学生，在广大学生群众的支持下占领了学校的行政大楼。当反动的学校当局出动大批校警前来逮捕这些学生时，约有二千五百名学生闻讯赶来，守卫在这座被学生占领的大楼面前，和校警展开了面对面的斗争。
    接着，在二十三日晚上，另外一百五十名学生在两千名学生的支持下又占领了这个学校的另一座大楼，抗议学校当局对黑人的歧视和对学生的镇压。二十四日，美国反动统治当局竟从旧金山湾地区调来了五百余名警察，对学生进行残酷的镇压和大规模逮捕。这时守卫在大楼外面的学生拣起石头进行回击。目前加利福尼亚大学学生的斗争仍在进一步发展中。
    新华社二十五日讯  阿姆斯特丹消息：继二十二日数百名学生的示威之后，约四千名荷兰学生二十四日晚上又在阿姆斯特丹举行声势更加浩大的示威，抗议反动当局迫害十五名荷兰学生。示威者还大力声援墨西哥学生反迫害的正义斗争和抗议美帝国主义侵略越南。
    学生们不顾反动的市当局的禁令，从他们的学校出发到市中心。被学生示威吓破了胆的反动当局出动大批全副武装的警察，对示威者进行残酷的镇压。示威者英勇地进行还击，并接着分散到全市各地继续进行示威。在示威过程中，学生们用石块袭击警察。一些学生还到市警察总局附近举行示威，惊惶失措的反动当局出动了所有警察的机动部队来保护这个总局。
    示威进行了约五个小时。一些学生领导人在二十四日晚上表示，阿姆斯特丹的学生今后将继续进行斗争。（附图片）
