Italian workers' struggle for improved living conditions and against layoffs, and students' struggle against the corrupt educational system are unfolding across Italy. Workers' struggles have received active participation and support from young students. Some demonstrating students have raised the battle cry of "Workers and students unite!"

In the Tuscan region of Pisa, several thousand students marched through the streets on the 21st to support the workers of the "Saint-Gobain" glass factory who had been on strike for eight days. The workers were striking against the management's decision to lay off approximately four hundred workers. The demonstrators stopped in front of a prison to show solidarity with three students who had been imprisoned for supporting the glass workers' struggle. They repeatedly shouted, "Release the imprisoned students!" "Do not allow the government to suppress!" Later, the demonstrating students went to the "Saint-Gobain" factory to meet the striking workers and express their support.

Workers and students held a joint rally on the 22nd.

In the capital Rome, over a thousand middle school students demonstrated outside a college on the 21st to protest the college administration's decision to suspend three students who had participated in the struggle. They held up banners and shouted slogans such as "No to suppression, we want freedom!" "We don't want the bosses' schools!" "Workers and students unite!" "This is just the beginning, we will continue to fight!" and so on.

The police brutally attacked them, but the students linked arms and bravely resisted the police's assault, shouting "The police are fascists!" In this struggle, nine students were arrested and five were injured.

On the same day, in Milan, Italy's second-largest city, about a thousand students surrounded the Minister of Education during his visit to a university, protesting the government's refusal to accept students' demands for democratic reforms in higher education. The students lay on the ground, preventing the minister's car from leaving. As a result, the minister had to flee the school in disgrace, protected by many police officers.

On the 22nd, workers from various factories in Rome went on strike for varying durations to support three hundred workers from a factory who had been on strike for 141 days to protest layoffs.

In the port city of Civitavecchia near Rome and in the town of Aquila in the Abruzzo region, workers recently held general strikes to protest layoffs and the worsening unemployment situation.

Similar strikes were held in other cities, all of which received active participation and support from students.

On the 21st, in the port of Genoa, a 24-hour strike by dock workers demanding wage increases caused the loading and unloading of goods on twelve cargo ships to come to a halt.

In the countryside, thousands of farmers in Perugia, Umbria, and thousands of farmers in Brindisi, Apulia, held street demonstrations on the 19th and 20th, respectively, to protest the severe unemployment in agriculture.

    意大利工人学生运动蓬勃开展
    学生积极支持工人罢工斗争；工人示威不许政府镇压学生
    新华社二十三日讯　罗马消息：意大利工人要求改善生活条件、反对解雇的斗争和学生反对腐朽教育制度的斗争正在意大利各地展开。工人的斗争得到了青年学生的积极参加和支持。有些示威学生提出了“学生和工人联合起来”的战斗口号。
    在杜斯卡纳区的彼萨，几千名学生二十一日在大街上举行了游行示威，支持“圣戈班”玻璃厂坚持了八天罢工的工人。这个厂的工人为抗议资方无理解雇大约四百名工人而进行了罢工斗争。示威者在一个监狱外停了下来，声援三个因为支持玻璃工人的斗争而被监禁的学生。他们一再高呼：“释放被监禁的学生！”“不许政府镇压！”后来，示威学生前往“圣戈班”工厂会见罢工工人，对他们表示声援。
    工人和学生二十二日还联合举行了集会。
    在意大利首都罗马，一千多名中学生二十一日在一所学院外面举行示威，抗议学院当局勒令三名参加斗争的学生停学。他们举着标语牌，高呼“不许镇压，要自由！”“不要老板们的学校！”“学生和工人联合起来！”“这仅仅是开始，我们还要继续斗争！”等战斗口号。
    警察野蛮地袭击他们，但是他们手挽着手，高呼“警察是法西斯”，英勇地抵抗了警察的袭击。在这场斗争中，九名学生被逮捕，五人受伤。
    同一天，在意大利第二大城市米兰，教育部长在视察一所大学的时候，大约一千名学生包围了他，抗议政府拒绝接受学生们关于高等教育实行民主改革的要求。学生们躺在地上，不让这个部长的汽车开走。结果，这个部长不得不在许多警察的保护下狼狈溜出学校。
    二十二日，罗马的各工厂的工人举行了时间不等的罢工，支持一家工厂的三百名工人为反对解雇而坚持了一百四十一天的斗争。
    在罗马附近的港口城市锡维塔韦奇亚和阿布鲁佐区的阿奎拉，工人们最近举行了总罢工，反对解雇，抗议日益严重的失业现象。
    在其他一些城市也举行了类似的罢工。这些斗争都得到了学生的积极参加和支持。
    二十一日，在热那亚港，由于码头工人为要求提高工资而举行二十四小时的罢工，使十二艘货船的装货和卸货工作陷于停顿。
    在农村，乌姆布利亚区的佩鲁贾的数千农民和阿浦利亚区的布林的西的数千农民也分别于十九日和二十日举行了街头示威游行，反对农业中的严重失业现象。
