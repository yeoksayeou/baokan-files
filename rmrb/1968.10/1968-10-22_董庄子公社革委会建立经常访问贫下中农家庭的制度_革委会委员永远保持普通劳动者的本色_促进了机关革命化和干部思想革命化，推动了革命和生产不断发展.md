The Dongzhuangzi Commune Revolutionary Committee in Hebei Province's Huailai County, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to link up with the masses," has established a system of regular visits to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. They actively engage in heart-to-heart talks with the poor and lower-middle peasants, which has effectively promoted the swift implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. This has driven the continuous development of revolution and production, and further promoted the revolutionization of the organs and the thought revolutionization of cadres.

The commune's revolutionary committee began visiting the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants in February this year. At that time, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "hold study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," organized family Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The committee members visited the homes of model families where the study classes were well-conducted. They went to the home of poor peasant member Jiang Xiuying and found that the four generations of this family, nine people in total, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works every day, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism every day, and greatly promoted thought revolutionization. This family study class had two good experiences: one was to frequently hold reminiscence activities to recall bitterness and sweetness, arousing deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao among all family members; the other was to frequently hold family study and application meetings. The committee members also visited more than ten other poor and lower-middle peasant families and found that the well-conducted family study classes all had these two experiences. After the committee promoted these experiences, it promoted the rapid popularization and improvement of family study classes throughout the commune.

The Dongzhuangzi Commune Revolutionary Committee tasted the sweetness from this practice. They established the system of regularly visiting the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants as an important institution.

Since then, whenever the great leader Chairman Mao issued new instructions, the committee members, together with the PLA agricultural support troops, would go out at night, climbing mountains and crossing valleys, to visit every village and go to the doors of the peasant masses to convey and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. During the busy spring plowing season this year, the Chenjiabazhai Brigade encountered the issue of someone cutting down collective trees, affecting the revolution and production. The committee chairman, Xu Minggui, visited this brigade and conducted home visits to the poor and lower-middle peasants. He propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions on one hand and had heart-to-heart talks with the poor and lower-middle peasants to understand the situation on the other. He analyzed the new situation and characteristics of class struggle in the local area with the poor and lower-middle peasant members and found out that this was a malicious wind blown by the class enemy to disrupt the revolution and production. Thus, through carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, sharpened their eyes, exposed the class enemy who was stirring up trouble behind the scenes, and ensured the successful completion of spring plowing.

During the home visits, the committee members received profound education from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They deeply felt that the poor and lower-middle peasants had the deepest proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, studied and applied the invincible Mao Zedong Thought the best, and they must honestly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the Yaojiahe Brigade, the 71-year-old old poor peasant Liu Deshun, known as "old red," worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord for half of his life in the old society. Now, he never leaves Chairman Mao's works by his side and is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in Huailai County. He has spoken more than 100 times at the brigade's revolutionary criticism meetings and has become an old warrior on the revolutionary criticism battlefield. The committee vice-chairman, Feng Zhenghong, visited Liu Deshun's home to learn from him six times. Feng Zhenghong took this old poor peasant as an example, diligently serving the people, and received praise from the masses.

The broad revolutionary masses cherish the newly born proletarian revolutionary power, and they are willing to tell the committee members their suggestions and criticisms face to face. The commune revolutionary committee members frequently visit the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants and have heart-to-heart talks with them, further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. Now, whenever the committee holds meetings to discuss issues, they first study the opinions raised by the masses during home visits, analyze them seriously, and make decisions. The committee members often hear the masses criticizing the bureaucratic style of the old commune party committee during their visits, and they also take this as a warning. The masses say: "In the past, when cadres went to the countryside, they slept in the brigade and did things through meetings." Now they go to the countryside and stay in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, and do things by consulting with the masses. The masses say: "Such cadres are our confidants, we trust them."

Through frequent home visits, the committee members have further strengthened their class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Poor peasant member and demobilized soldier Zhou Fuyu suffered from a serious eye disease and had not received good treatment for two years. The committee members learned about this during their home visits, and the committee chairman and vice-chairman personally visited him to help solve the difficulties of coal, firewood, and medical expenses. One standing committee member went to the county city for a meeting and still remembered this matter, and met a doctor from Beijing, arranging for Zhou Fuyu to be treated. Under the care of the commune revolutionary committee, Zhou Fuyu's eye disease was cured, and he saw the light again. He stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and said excitedly: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The more I see you, the broader my heart, the brighter my eyes. You personally cultivated the revolutionary committee, which thinks of everything for us poor and lower-middle peasants and has a heart-to-heart connection with us."

The Dongzhuangzi Commune Revolutionary Committee has realized from practice that regularly visiting the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants and having heart-to-heart talks with them has six main advantages: first, it is convenient to timely and accurately grasp the masses' active thoughts and new trends of class struggle in each period, making the committee members well-informed; second, it is convenient to discover new things and advanced examples, providing favorable conditions for the committee to implement point-to-face leadership; third, it is convenient to contact the elderly and infirm poor and lower-middle peasants who have difficulty moving, making the committee able to solicit the opinions of the masses to the greatest extent; fourth, it is convenient to contact the masses in villages far from the commune, making the committee maintain the broadest mass base; fifth, it is convenient to timely discover and correct the errors and shortcomings in the committee's work; sixth, it is convenient to continuously draw nourishment from the masses, making the committee members always maintain the character of ordinary laborers and promote the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre.

    董庄子公社革委会建立经常访问贫下中农家庭的制度
    革委会委员永远保持普通劳动者的本色
    促进了机关革命化和干部思想革命化，推动了革命和生产不断发展
    新华社石家庄二十一日电　河北省怀来县董庄子公社革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的伟大教导，建立经常访问贫下中农家庭的制度，积极开展同贫下中农谈心活动，有力地促进了毛主席一系列最新指示的迅速落实，推动了革命和生产的不断发展，也进一步促进了机关革命化和干部思想革命化。
    这个公社革委会访问贫下中农家庭的活动，是今年二月份开始的。当时，广大贫下中农遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的指示，大办家庭毛泽东思想学习班。革委会成员到家庭学习班办得比较好的社员家庭，进行了访问。他们来到贫农社员蒋秀英家，发现这一家老小四辈，大小九口，天天坚持学习毛主席著作，天天斗私批修，大大促进了思想革命化。这个家庭学习班，有两条好经验：一条是经常开展忆苦思甜活动，激发全家人对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情；一条是经常召开学用结合的家庭讲用会。革委会成员又访问了其他十几户贫下中农，发现办得好的家庭学习班，也都有这两条经验。革委会推广他们的经验以后，促进了全公社家庭学习班的迅速普及和提高。
    董庄子公社革委会从这一实践中，尝到了甜头。他们就把经常访问贫下中农家庭，作为一项重要制度固定下来。
    从这以后，每当伟大领袖毛主席发出最新指示，革委会同志就和解放军支农部队同志一起，以最大的热情，最快的速度，连夜出动，爬山越岭，深入各村，走上社员群众门，向社员群众传达、落实毛主席的最新指示。今年春耕大忙时，陈家堡大队发生有人砍集体树的情况，影响抓革命、促生产。革委会主任胥明贵来到这个大队，到贫下中农家庭进行访问。他一面宣传毛主席的最新指示，一面和贫下中农谈心了解情况。他同贫下中农社员一起分析当地阶级斗争的新形势、新特点，了解到这是阶级敌人刮起的一股破坏抓革命、促生产的妖风。于是，通过开展革命大批判，使贫下中农提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，擦亮了眼睛，揪出了在幕后煽风点火的阶级敌人，保证了春耕生产的胜利完成。
    在家庭访问中，革委会成员受到广大贫下中农的深刻教育，他们深深感到贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级感情最深，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想学得最活，用得最好，自己必须老老实实向贫下中农学习。姚家河大队七十一岁的老贫农刘德春，人称“老来红”，他在旧社会给地主当了半辈子长工，现在他毛主席著作不离身，是怀来县学习毛主席著作积极分子。他在全队革命大批判会上发言一百多次，成为革命大批判战场上的老将。革委会副主任封正宏先后六次去刘德春家访问学习。封正宏以这位老贫农为榜样，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务，受到群众好评。
    广大革命群众最爱护新生的无产阶级革命政权，对革委会成员有什么建议和批评意见，都愿意面对面地讲给革委会成员听。公社革委会成员经常访问贫下中农家庭，同贫下中农谈心，进一步密切了干群关系。现在，革委会每次开会，研究问题，首先研究家庭访问中群众提出的意见，认真分析，做出决定。革委会成员在访问中，常常听到群众批判旧公社党委官僚主义作风的一些话，他们也注意引以为戒。群众说：“过去干部下乡，睡觉住大队，办事凭开会。”现在他们下乡就往贫下中农家里住，办事和群众商量。群众说：“这样的干部是我们的贴心人，我们信得过。”
    革委会成员通过经常的家庭访问，也进一步增强了对贫下中农的阶级感情。贫农社员、复员军人周福玉患了严重的眼病，两年来一直没有得到很好治疗，革委会成员在家庭访问时知道了，革委会主任和副主任亲自登门看望，帮助他解决烧煤、烧柴和医疗费用等困难。有一位常委到县城开会，还惦记着这事，遇到北京来的一个医生，便设法把周福玉接去治疗。在公社革委会的关怀下，周福玉的眼病治好了，重见了光明。他站在毛主席像前，激动地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我越看您老人家，心越宽，眼越亮，您老人家亲自培育的革命委员会，什么问题都替我们贫下中农想到了，和我们贫下中农心连心。”
    董庄子公社革委会从实践中体会到，经常访问贫下中农家庭，同贫下中农谈心，主要有六条好处：一、便于及时、准确地掌握各个时期群众的活思想和阶级斗争新动向，使革委会成员胸中有数；二、便于发现新生事物和先进典型，为革委会实行以点带面的领导提供有利条件；三、便于联系年老体衰、行动不便的贫下中农，使革委会能够最大限度地征求群众意见；四、便于联系离公社较远村庄的社员群众，使革委会保持最广泛的群众基础；五、便于及时发现和纠正革委会工作中的错误和缺点；六、便于从群众中不断吸取营养，使革委会成员永远保持普通劳动者的本色，促进领导班子思想革命化。（附图片）
