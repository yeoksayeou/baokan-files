Chairman Mao's latest directive is like a spring thunder, stirring the hearts of countless cadres; like the sun shining brightly, illuminating the path of revolutionizing the organs and cadres.

"Sending a large number of cadres to work in the countryside is a very good opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go to the countryside in batches to work." Chairman Mao's directive expresses the sentiments of workers, peasants, and soldiers and resonates deeply in the hearts of cadres. We are delighted to see that cadres are studying Chairman Mao's latest directive with tears of joy, resolutely following the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao, and tempering themselves into eternal shining gold in the crucible of the three great revolutionary movements.

Sending cadres to work in the countryside is Chairman Mao's proletarian cadre policy and cadre line, a fundamental strategy to ensure that people do not degenerate, the party does not become revisionist, and the country does not change color. For proletarian cadres, this is the broad path to maintaining and carrying forward revolutionary youth. Apart from this, there is either a dead-end or a blind alley. Revolutionary cadres must steadfastly follow this broad path, walking to the end without hesitation or deviation. In this way, we can grow into towering giants who are unmoved by sweet winds and unshaken by sugar-coated bullets, making the contributions we should to the revolution and the people.

In a society with classes, people's thoughts inevitably bear the imprint of class. On the issue of sending cadres to work in the countryside, people with different worldviews have different understandings. Revolutionary cadres regard working in the countryside as a process of refining gold, determined to learn anew and undergo countless temperings through labor. There are also a few who see it as an opportunity to gild themselves. "Refining" and "gilding," though differing by only one character, reflect the fundamental issue of loyalty or disloyalty to Chairman Mao and whether his latest directive is genuinely implemented or not. It reflects the struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews.

Refining is a revolutionary attitude. The tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deeply touches the soul of every individual. Most cadres, through the tempering and testing of this class struggle and line struggle storm, deeply realize that cadres cannot achieve revolutionization without undergoing labor. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office but are seeking revolution." The key to the revolutionization of cadres is to thoroughly eliminate the "official" mentality, discard the thought of being an "official," and replace it with the thought of revolution. This process of "revolutionization" is the process of transforming one's worldview through labor and refining oneself in the fiery crucible of the three great revolutionary movements. Without going through this process, the "official" mentality binding cadres cannot be eliminated, the spiritual shackles of officialism, arrogance, decadence, conceit, and pampering in some cadres cannot be broken, the situation of some cadres being detached from the masses cannot be changed, and cadres will inevitably become captives of the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets.

Contrary to "refining" is the attitude of "gilding." This attitude is actually hypocritical, with a shining exterior covering the unsavory things hidden deep in the soul. Liu Shaoqi is the chief culprit who enthusiastically advocates and peddles the theory of "labor gilding." He regards going to the mountains and countryside and participating in labor as a means of seeking fame and fortune, viewing it as a "shortcut" to promotion and wealth. With a set of thoroughly rotten business practices, he corrupts the souls of cadres, intellectuals, and young students. Thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's theory of "labor gilding" and eliminating its poison in cadres and intellectuals is an important guarantee for adhering to the path of laborization and revolutionization. Those poisoned by this fallacy must consciously struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, "scrape the bones to cure the poison," otherwise, they will not only fail to achieve laborization and revolutionization but will inevitably fall.

Sending cadres to work in the countryside is a process of refining, not a means of gilding. We must thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's theory of "labor gilding," consciously jump into the crucible of the three great revolutionary struggles, accept countless temperings, and refine ourselves into genuine gold, becoming thorough and through revolutionized true proletarian revolutionary fighters!

    炼金和镀金
    三六六○部队战士　姜应福
    毛主席的最新指示，象春雷一声响，激荡着广大干部的心；象太阳放光辉，照亮了机关革命化、干部革命化的道路。
    “广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”毛主席的指示，说出了工农兵的心里话，说进了广大干部的心坎里。我们高兴地看到，广大干部热泪盈眶地学习毛主席的最新指示，欢欣鼓舞地决心走毛主席所指引的光明大道，在三大革命运动的熔炉里把自己锤炼成永远闪闪发光的真金。
    干部下放劳动，是毛主席的无产阶级干部路线和干部政策，是保证人不变质、党不变修、国不变色的根本大计。这条路，对于无产阶级的干部来说，是永远保持和发扬革命青春的阳关大道。除此以外，不是独木桥，便是死胡同。革命的干部，要坚定不移地沿着这条阳关大道走下去，走到底，千万不要犹豫，不要转向。这样，我们就能成长为香风吹不动、糖弹击不倒的顶天立地的巨人，就能为革命、为人民作出应有的贡献。
    在有阶级的社会里，人们的思想不能不打上阶级的烙印。在干部下放劳动这个问题上，不同世界观的人们有不同的认识。广大革命干部，把下放劳动，当成炼金的过程，决心在劳动中重新学习，经受千锤百炼。也有少数人，则把它看成镀金的机会。“炼金”和“镀金”，一字之差，却反映出对毛主席忠不忠，对毛主席的最新指示真落实还是假落实的大问题，反映了无产阶级和资产阶级两种根本不同的世界观的斗争。
    炼金，是革命的态度。轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，深深地触及了每一个人的灵魂。大多数干部经受这场阶级斗争、路线斗争风暴的锻炼和考验，深深认识到，干部不经过劳动化，就很难达到革命化。毛主席教导说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。干部革命化，关键就是要彻底打掉“官”字，弃掉当“官”思想，换个为革命的思想。这个“化”的过程，就是在劳动中改造世界观，在三大革命运动的烈火中炼金的过程。不经历这个过程，束缚干部的“官”字就打不掉，存在于有些干部身上的官气、阔气、暮气、骄气、娇气的精神枷锁就砸不烂，有的干部脱离群众的状况就改变不了，干部也就难免成为资产阶级糖衣炮弹的俘虏。
    同“炼金”相反的，是“镀金”的态度。这种态度，实际上就是口是心非，表里不一，就是用发光的外表掩盖灵魂深处见不得人的东西。中国赫鲁晓夫，是狂热鼓吹和兜售
  “劳动镀金”论的罪魁祸首。他把上山下乡、参加劳动，当作沽名钓誉的手段，看作升官发财的“捷径”。他用一套腐朽透顶的生意经，腐蚀干部和知识分子、青年学生的灵魂。彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“劳动镀金”论，肃清它在干部和知识分子中间的流毒，是坚持劳动化、革命化道路的重要保证。受这种谬论毒害的人们，要自觉地斗私、批修，“刮骨疗毒”，否则就不仅谈不上劳动化、革命化，而且势必要栽跟斗。
    干部下放劳动，是炼金的过程，决不是镀金的手段。我们一定要彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“劳动镀金”论，自觉地跳进三大革命斗争的熔炉里去，接受千锤百炼，把自己炼成彻头彻尾彻里彻外革命化的“真金”，炼成坚强的无产阶级革命战士！
