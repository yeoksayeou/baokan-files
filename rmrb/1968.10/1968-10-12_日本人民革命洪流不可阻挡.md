On the first anniversary of the struggle at Tokyo's Haneda Airport against the pro-American, traitorous Prime Minister Sato's visit to the South Vietnamese puppet regime, large-scale anti-American demonstrations erupted in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and other cities. The demonstrators bravely blocked the passage of trains carrying fuel for American military aircraft and erected barricades in the bustling streets of Tokyo, engaging in fierce battles with the heavily armed police sent by the Sato government to suppress them. Once again, the revolutionary people of Japan demonstrated their heroic spirit of fearlessness and daring to fight.

Over the past year, the anti-American, patriotic struggle of the Japanese people has surged forward, wave after wave. In their anti-American demonstrations, the Japanese people have raised battle cries such as "Abolish the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" "Remove U.S. military bases!" "Oppose the invasion of Vietnam!" and launched a fierce, sustained offensive against American imperialism and its lackey, the reactionary Sato government. It is through such repeated, intense struggles that the revolutionary people of Japan have been tempered, and their political consciousness has continuously risen. Currently, the Japanese people are concentrating their efforts to oppose the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' and U.S. military bases. They are determined to smash the shackles imposed on the Japanese nation by American imperialism with their own iron fists. The revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people is dealing heavy blows to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

Faced with the increasingly powerful struggle of the Japanese people, the panicked U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, on the one hand, are using brutal fascist methods to intensify the bloody suppression of the revolutionary people of Japan; on the other hand, they are desperately using their lackeys and henchmen, the Miyamoto revisionist group, to spread various bewildering arguments to numb the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people and sabotage the anti-American, patriotic struggle of the Japanese people.

Recently, the Miyamoto revisionist group has been loudly advocating that if a "democratic government" produced by the "majority" of the "Diet" issues a "notification" in the future, it can "terminate" the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'. What does this mean? This means that the Japanese people do not need to engage in anti-American struggles at all, and as long as they patiently wait for the day when the Miyamoto revisionist group suddenly obtains a "majority" in the parliament, they can grant national independence to the Japanese people with a single piece of paper, and the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries will obediently withdraw from the historical stage. This absurd talk is a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary fallacy.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao pointed out: "The oppressed peoples and oppressed nations cannot entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle."

The Japanese people understand that their liberation cannot rely on the kindness of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, but only through the strong unity of the revolutionary people and unremitting, unyielding struggle can they achieve their own liberation. The butcher's knife of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the anesthetic of the Miyamoto revisionist group cannot stop the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people. The Japanese people must be liberated, and the Japanese revolution must be victorious! The mighty revolutionary tide of the Japanese people will continue to roll forward, burying the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and all their accomplices and henchmen!

### 日本人民革命洪流不可阻挡

    日本人民革命洪流不可阻挡
    在日本人民反对亲美卖国首相佐藤出国“访问”南越傀儡的东京羽田机场斗争的一周年，在东京、京都、大阪等地爆发了大规模的反美示威。示威群众英勇地阻止为美军运输飞机燃料的火车通过，并在东京的闹市里筑起街垒，同佐藤政府派去镇压的大批武装警察进行激烈的搏斗，又一次表现了日本革命人民不畏强暴、敢于战斗的英雄气概。
    一年以来，日本人民的反美爱国斗争，一浪接一浪地向前发展。日本人民在反美示威中，高呼“废除日美‘安全条约’！”“撤除美军基地！”“反对侵略越南！”等战斗的口号，向着美帝国主义及其仆从佐藤反动政府发动了猛烈的、持续的进攻。正是在这样反复的激烈的斗争中，日本革命人民得到了锻炼，政治觉悟不断提高。当前，日本人民正集中力量反对日美“安全条约”和美军基地，他们决心要用自己的铁拳粉碎美帝国主义强加在日本民族身上的枷锁。日本人民的革命斗争，正在给予美日反动派以沉重的打击。
    面对着日本人民日益强大的斗争，惊慌失措的美日反动派，一方面用残暴的法西斯手段加紧对日本革命人民进行血腥镇压；另一方面又竭力利用它们的奴仆和爪牙宫本修正主义集团散布种种蛊惑人心的论调来麻痹革命人民的斗志，破坏日本人民的反美爱国斗争。
    宫本修正主义集团近来大肆鼓吹什么只要将来通过“国会的多数”产生的“民主政府”发出一个“通知”，就可以“终止”日美“安全条约”了。这是什么意思呢？这就是说，日本人民根本没有必要进行反美斗争，而只要耐心地等待宫本修正主义集团有那么一天在议会里忽然得到了“多数”，就能够凭一纸“通知”，把民族独立“恩赐”给日本人民，美日反动派也就会乖乖地退出历史舞台了。这种天下奇谈，是彻头彻尾的反革命谬论。
    我们伟大导师毛主席指出：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    日本人民懂得，他们的解放绝不能依靠美日反动派发善心，只有依靠革命人民坚强的团结和坚持不懈的、前赴后继的斗争，才能获得自己的解放。美日反动派的屠刀和宫本修正主义集团的麻醉剂，都阻止不了日本人民的革命斗争。日本人民一定要解放，日本革命一定要胜利！日本人民的强大革命洪流，必将继续滚滚向前，直到把美日反动派及其一切帮凶、爪牙统统埋葬！
