The Revolutionary Committee of Guangzhou Railway Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, firmly follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, relying on the broad revolutionary railway workers, using revolution to promote production, and achieving victories in both revolution and production.

Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received all the representatives attending the National Railway and Transportation Conference in May this year, which greatly inspired and educated the revolutionary staff of Guangzhou Railway Bureau. With unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they vigorously carry out class struggle, making the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination in all units under the bureau continuously consolidated and developed. All 132 units in the bureau quickly established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups, achieving a red tide throughout the bureau. The broad masses of railway workers, with the heightened sense of responsibility that "the working class is the leading class," while sending a large number of outstanding workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism. In the face of reduced personnel, they vigorously grasp revolution and vigorously promote production, making the production situation of the bureau increasingly better, with transportation volume rising month by month. The bureau's September cargo loading and unloading volume increased by more than 11% compared to August. The bureau also completed the September cargo loading task ahead of schedule. Due to the continuous improvement of labor productivity, the utilization efficiency of locomotives and vehicles has also greatly improved. According to the indicators, the utilization efficiency of locomotives and vehicles in September was equivalent to saving 262 locomotives and 74,000 freight cars compared to August. Many revolutionary workers, with their actual actions of pulling more and running faster, express their loyalty to Chairman Mao and continuously create new axle-overloading records. The axle-overloading traction movement, which first arose in Guangzhou Locomotive Section in July and August, has now been widely promoted throughout the bureau's lines, forming a magnificent mass movement.

Now, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels, the broad masses of railway workers in Guangzhou Railway Bureau are further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, rapidly launching a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, striving to achieve another great victory in the revolutionary and production struggle in the fourth quarter, and making greater contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Under the inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the revolution and production of Jinan Railway Bureau have made great strides forward. The cargo volume in the second quarter of this year increased by 27.4% compared to the first quarter, and the third quarter increased by more than 19% compared to the same period last year. Coal and other important materials for supporting agriculture have achieved the goal of transporting as much as produced and as much as received, strongly supporting industrial and agricultural production.

Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels and with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, the broad revolutionary staff of Jinan Railway Bureau have always put studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice first. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is thriving throughout the bureau, from the office to the production site, from stations and sections to work areas, classes, and staff dormitories, from waiting rooms to trains, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are in full bloom.

The broad revolutionary staff firmly remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," actively launching fierce attacks on class enemies, and digging out a small handful of deeply hidden class enemies. They use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of enterprise management pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department, and firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the broad revolutionary staff of Jinan Railway Bureau closely cooperate with brother enterprises, cancel unreasonable transfer links, and realize the joint transportation of railways, highways, and waterways, greatly changing the face of railway passenger and freight transportation, accelerating the turnover of goods, and facilitating passengers. Currently, the number of stations handling cargo joint transportation in the bureau has increased from 52 to 76; the number of stations handling passenger joint transportation has increased from 27 to 43.

The broad revolutionary staff of Jinan Railway Bureau are now launching a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation with a thorough revolutionary spirit, determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary staff of Harbin Railway Bureau resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," using revolution to lead production and using revolution to promote production, with transportation production rising step by step, excellently completing the transportation task of national key materials. According to preliminary statistics, the bureau's cargo loading volume in the second quarter increased by 456 cars per day compared to the first quarter, and the third quarter increased by 355 cars per day compared to the second quarter. The turnover time of freight cars is gradually shortened.

Harbin Railway Bureau is responsible for the transportation of important materials such as coal, grain, and timber from Heilongjiang Province to various places across the country. Since this year, the three major coal mines of Shuangyashan, Hetian, and Qitaihe have continuously increased production, urgently needing to transport a large amount of coal to various places. The revolutionary staff of Jiamusi Railway Division, responsible for the coal transportation of these three mines, think of every possible way to obtain empty cars from loaded cars, quickly sending the large number of empty cars unloaded to the coal mines, ensuring that the increased coal is timely transported to various places.

Heilongjiang Province had a bumper harvest in agriculture last year, and a large amount of grain needs to be transported to various places across the country this spring. The broad revolutionary staff of Suihua Railway Division regard the transportation of grain as an important political task. To rush and quickly transport grain, they organize grain special trains through reasonable scheduling, ensuring that a large amount of grain is continuously transported to various parts of the motherland. This year, the timber production in Xiaoxinganling and Wudalianchi Forest Areas has increased significantly. The revolutionary staff of Harbin Railway Bureau dare to innovate, reforming unreasonable regulations in the transportation sector, adopting priority handling and priority transportation, ensuring that the timber urgently needed for national key construction projects is quickly transported from the forest areas.

    以“工人阶级是领导阶级”的高度责任感勇挑重担
    广大铁路工人抓革命促生产获新胜利
    广州铁路局
    广州铁路局革命委员会在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定不移地依靠广大革命的铁路工人，以革命带动生产，取得了革命、生产双胜利。
    毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席在今年五月接见出席全国铁路、交通会议的全体代表，给了广州铁路局的广大革命职工以极大的鼓舞和教育，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，狠抓阶级斗争，使全局所属各单位的革命大联合和革命三结合不断巩固和发展。全局一百三十二个单位很快建立了革委会或革命领导小组，实现了全局上下一片红。广大铁路工人以“工人阶级是领导阶级”的高度责任感，在派出大批优秀工人参加毛泽东思想宣传队的同时，深入持久地开展革命大批判，在人员减少的情况下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全局生产形势越来越好，运输量月月上升。全局九月份装车、卸车量比八月份增长百分之十一以上。全局还提前完成了九月份的装车任务。由于劳动生产率不断提高，机车和车辆的运用效率也有很大提高，按指标计算，九月份机车、车辆运用效率同八月份比较，全月相当于节省了二百六十二台机车，节省货车七万四千多辆。许多革命工人以多拉快跑的实际行动向毛主席表忠心，不断创造超轴新纪录。七、八月份首先由广州机务段兴起的超轴牵引运动，现在已在全局线路普遍推广，形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    现在，广州铁路局的广大铁路工人正在各级革委会领导下，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，迅速掀起斗、批、改的新高潮，争取第四季度在革命和生产斗争中再打个大胜仗，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出更大贡献。
    济南铁路局
    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的鼓舞下，济南铁路局革命和生产大踏步地向前发展。今年第二季度的货运量，比第一季度提高百分之二十七点四，第三季度比去年同期提高百分之十九以上。煤炭和支农等重要物资做到了产多少，运多少，来多少，运多少，有力地支援了工农业生产。
    济南铁路局广大革命职工在各级革命委员会的领导下，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，始终把活学活用毛泽东思想放在首位，全局活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动蓬勃发展，这个铁路局从机关到生产现场，从站、段到工区、班组以及职工宿舍，从候车室到列车上，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班如红花遍地。
    广大革命职工牢记伟大领袖毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，挖出了一小撮隐藏很深的阶级敌人。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁道部门的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。济南铁路局广大革命职工在山东省革命委员会的领导下，与兄弟企业单位密切协作，取消了不合理的中转环节，实现了铁路、公路、航运等部门的联合运输，大大改变了铁路客货运输的面貌，加速了货物运转，便利了旅客。目前，全局办理货物联运的车站由五十二个增加到七十六个；办理客运联运的车站由二十七个增加到四十三个。
    济南铁路局广大革命职工正以彻底的革命精神，掀起斗、批、改高潮，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    哈尔滨铁路局
    哈尔滨铁路局广大革命职工坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以革命统帅生产，以革命推动生产，运输生产节节上升，出色地完成了国家重点物资的运输任务。据初步统计，全局装车量第二季度比第一季度每天多装四百五十六车，第三季度又比第二季度每天多装三百五十五车。货车周转时间逐渐缩短。
    哈尔滨铁路局担负着黑龙江省支援全国各地的煤炭、粮食、木材等重要物资的运输任务。今年以来，双鸭山、鹤岗、七台河等三大煤矿不断增产，急需把大量煤炭运送各地。担负这三个矿煤炭运输任务的佳木斯铁路分局的革命职工，想方设法向重车要空车，把抢卸出来的大批空车迅速送到煤矿，保证增产的煤及时运到了各地。
    黑龙江省去年农业获得丰收，今年春季有大批粮食要运往全国各地。绥化铁路分局的广大革命职工，把运粮当作一项重要政治任务。为了抢运、快运粮食，他们经过合理调度，组织粮食专车，保证大批粮食源源运送到祖国各地。今年，小兴安岭林区和完达山林区木材生产大幅度增长。哈尔滨铁路局的革命职工大胆创新，改革运输方面不合理的规章制度，采取优先办理、优先运送等办法，保证了国家重点建设工程急需的木材从林区快速运出。
