In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entering the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the workers of Beijing Third Steel Rolling Mill, in close cooperation with some design and research units' revolutionary technical personnel, successfully transformed a four-high cold rolling mill into China's first new structure ultra-thin strip cold rolling mill. The birth of this rolling mill is the result of our high举毛泽东思想伟大红旗, carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance, and is another victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev consistently advocated the "slave philosophy" and "crawling philosophy," claiming that "our technology is not good, buying from abroad for experimentation is acceptable." His agents in the metallurgical system also shouted, "domestically produced rolling mills are not as good as imported rolling mills, and imported rolling mills are not as good as imported steel." The reactionary technical "authorities" in the metallurgical field also exaggerated the ultra-thin strip cold rolling mill, making it seem like something supernatural, and did not allow for its trial production. This resulted in China's urgent need for ultra-thin strips to rely on imports. Later, a small clique of capitalist roaders in the metallurgical system bought some so-called "advanced equipment" cold rolling mills from abroad, which were actually outdated equipment and could not solve China's ultra-thin strip production problem.

After learning about these situations, we workers were furious. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and must catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." We realized that whether or not to produce the ultra-thin strip cold rolling mill is a big issue of revolutionary spirit. An old worker said: "Under the leadership of our most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao, our country has become the base of the world revolution. The Chinese working class must produce new types of rolling mills to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world!" Full of hatred towards imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries as well as the Chinese Khrushchev clique, and full of revolutionary enthusiasm to make Chairman Mao proud and bring glory to the motherland, we launched an intense battle.

We seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the "Anshan Constitution" personally formulated by Chairman Mao, and launched a revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev clique's worship of foreigners and "experts," contempt for the masses of workers and peasants, and implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist technological line, attempting to restore capitalism in China. The stationed PLA also enthusiastically helped us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, providing a more solid political and ideological guarantee for our trial production work.

In the design process of the rolling mill, we workers, based on practical experience, made many major revisions to the original design. For example, the key to the rolling mill—the support of the working rolls—was originally designed according to foreign data, using screw tightening. This device not only operated inconveniently but also worked very unreliably. A skilled worker, unconstrained by foreign frameworks, proposed using a hydraulic method, which effectively solved this problem.

In the trial production process, we carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, finding materials ourselves when we lacked them, and using manual labor when we lacked equipment. For example, a major component of the new rolling mill is a large cast steel part. Its machining accuracy requirement is very high, and foreigners use high-precision grinding machines for processing. Our factory does not have such equipment, so a few of us manually scraped and polished it. Several young technicians also insisted on working with us. Everyone was fearless of hardship and fatigue, working day and night, and finally successfully scraped and polished this hard cast steel part. After measurement, the scraping and polishing accuracy fully met the design requirements. Our factory's mechanical processing capability is relatively weak, so we mobilized the masses to find solutions and cooperate with sister units. In this way, after more than a year of struggle, the country's first new structure ultra-thin strip cold rolling mill was finally born in the hands of the working class.

Recently, relevant departments organized an appraisal meeting with representatives from more than ten sister units. The appraisal showed that some major technical parameters of the rolling mill surpassed the level of similar foreign rolling mills, and its structure is simple and practical, opening up a new path for China to transform ordinary four-high cold rolling mills to roll ultra-thin strips.

Chairman Mao said: "The humble are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." The birth of this rolling mill refuted the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev clique and reactionary technical "authorities" who look down upon the Chinese working class. We, the working class, must occupy the scientific and technological front, and must surpass the Western bourgeoisie. We are determined to achieve greater results and contribute our utmost to catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced scientific and technological level.

    自力更生，赶超世界先进水平
    北京第三轧钢厂新型轧机试验小组工人
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入斗、批、改的高潮中，我们北京第三轧钢厂的工人，和一些设计、研究单位的革命技术人员密切协作，成功地把一台四辊冷轧机，改装成为我国第一台新结构的极薄带材冷轧机。这台轧机的诞生，是我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬自力更生精神的结果，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一胜利。
    过去，中国赫鲁晓夫一贯鼓吹“洋奴哲学”、“爬行哲学”，胡说什么：“我们的技术不行，从外国买来试验是可以的。”他在冶金系统的代理人也跟着叫嚷：“自己制造轧机不如进口轧机，进口轧机不如进口钢材。”冶金界的反动技术“权威”，也把极薄带材冷轧机，吹得神乎其神，不让动手试制。这样，使得我国急需的极薄带材，一直依赖进口。后来，冶金系统的一小撮走资派，从国外买来一些号称“先进设备”的冷轧机，实际上都是落后的陈旧设备，根本解决不了我国极薄带材的生产问题。
    我们工人知道这些情况后，肺都气炸了。我们反复学习毛主席的教导：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”我们认识到，搞不搞极薄带材冷轧机，是有没有革命志气的大问题。有的老工人说：“在最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，我国已经成为世界革命的根据地。我们中国的工人阶级，一定要把新型的轧机制造出来，支援世界人民的革命斗争！”我们满怀着对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派及中国赫鲁晓夫之流的仇恨，满怀着为毛主席争气、为祖国增光的革命豪情，投入了紧张的战斗。
    我们认真学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示和毛主席亲自制订的“鞍钢宪法”，并且展开了革命的大批判，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫之流崇拜洋人和“专家”，轻视工农群众，推行反革命修正主义的科技路线，妄图在中国复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。驻厂解放军又热情地帮助我们活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，使我们的试制工作，有了更坚强的政治思想保证。
    在轧机的设计过程中，我们工人从实践经验出发，对原设计作了许多重大的修改。例如，轧机的关键之一——工作辊的支撑，原设计根据外国资料，采用螺丝顶紧，这种装置不仅操作不便，而且工作很不可靠。一位老师傅不受洋框框的束缚，提出采用液压的办法，很好地解决了这个问题。
    在试制工作中，我们发扬了自力更生的精神，没有材料，自己找；没有设备，自己用手工干。例如，新轧机有个主要零件，是一个大铸钢件。它的加工精度要求很高，洋人都是在高级精密磨床上加工的。我厂没有这种设备，几个人就用手工刮研。几个青年技术员也坚持和我们一道劳动。大家不怕苦，不怕累，日夜奋战，终于把这个坚硬的铸钢件刮研成功。经过测量，刮研精度完全合乎设计要求。我们工厂的机械加工能力比较薄弱，我们就发动群众想办法，找兄弟单位搞协作。就这样，经过一年多的奋斗，全国第一台新结构极薄带材冷轧机，终于在我们工人阶级手里诞生了。
    最近，有关部门组织了有十几个兄弟单位代表参加的鉴定会。鉴定表明，轧机的某些主要技术参数，超过了国外同类型轧机的水平，而且结构简单，适用，为我国改装普通四辊冷轧机轧制极薄带材，闯出了一条新的途径。
    毛主席说：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。这台轧机的诞生，驳倒了中国赫鲁晓夫之流和反动技术“权威”轻视中国工人阶级的谬论。我们工人阶级一定要占领科学技术阵地，一定要压倒西方资产阶级。我们决心作出更大的成绩，为赶上和超过世界先进科学技术水平而贡献出最大的力量。
