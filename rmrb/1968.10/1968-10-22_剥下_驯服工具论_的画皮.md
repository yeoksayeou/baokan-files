	Stripping Away the Mask of the "Tame Tool Theory"
	Deputy Political Instructor Liu Jinhe, Eighth Depot Repair Team, Beijing Municipal Transportation Company

	Chinese Khrushchev, in his attempt to restore capitalism, vigorously promotes the "tame tool theory." He deliberately avoids mentioning that party members should maintain revolutionary vigilance against this type of bourgeois conspirator who has infiltrated the party, and instead repeatedly shouts that party members should be "tame tools." This "tame tool theory" is extremely malicious, aiming to suffocate the revolutionary spirit of communist party members and attempting to turn them from advanced fighters of the proletariat into "tame tools" for his restoration of capitalism.

	In the past, due to my low awareness of the struggle between the two lines within the party, I was poisoned by Chinese Khrushchev's "tame tool theory." It was only through more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that I woke up, recognized the counter-revolutionary nature of his "tame tool theory," and came to love Comrade Mao Zedong, our great leader, even more. I also came to hate Chinese Khrushchev, the most treacherous scoundrel.

	I am the son of a poor peasant. In 1948, Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army to liberate my hometown, and we were liberated. We genuinely love him. With the determination to follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, I enlisted in the army and later joined the Chinese People's Volunteers, participating in the Korean War and being honored to join the Communist Party. In 1956, I was transferred to a local unit. When I saw unreasonable phenomena, I dared to speak out. However, later I encountered resistance, being told that I "should not defy leadership." After 1959, I was sent four times to the party school run by Peng Zhen's old Beijing Municipal Committee to "study," where students were required to examine their past "errors" of "defying leadership," systematically poisoned by the "tame tool theory."

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sounded the alarm, and the revolutionary masses raised the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," rising up to thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Due to being deeply poisoned by the "tame tool theory," I initially stood on the wrong side in the movement. Later, as the movement developed, revolutionary masses exposed a large number of shocking facts, and I gradually saw more clearly how the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, led by Chinese Khrushchev, wearing the cloak of Communist Party members, engaged in evil plots to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. They shouted about being the party's "tame tools," originally intending to deceive us into becoming "tame tools" for them, this small handful of capitalist roaders hidden within the party, to restore capitalism! When I realized this, I actively approached the revolutionary masses, accepting their education and help, and together with them, under Chairman Mao's great command, rushed to the front line of class struggle.

    剥下“驯服工具论”的画皮
    北京市运输公司八场修理连副指导员　刘金合
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，极力鼓吹“驯服工具论”。他故意不提党员要对象他这种混入党内的资产阶级阴谋家保持应有的革命警惕，进行针锋相对的斗争，而一个劲地叫嚷党员要“作驯服的工具”。他这种“驯服工具论”，十分恶毒，目的就是要扼杀共产党员应有的无产阶级革命性，妄图使党员由无产阶级的先进战士蜕化变质，成为他复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”。
    我过去由于党内两条路线斗争的觉悟很低，中了中国赫鲁晓夫“驯服工具论”的毒，两年多来的文化大革命才使我清醒过来，认清了他的“驯服工具论”的反革命本质；使我更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，也使我恨透了中国赫鲁晓夫这个最阴险的坏蛋。
    我是一个贫农的儿子。一九四八年毛主席他老人家派亲人解放军解放了我的家乡，也使我们一家翻了身。我们打心眼里热爱他老人家。我带着跟随毛主席闹革命的决心，报名参了军，以后又参加了中国人民志愿军，并在朝鲜战场上光荣地参加了共产党。一九五六年我转业到地方，见到不合理的现象，敢于大胆提出意见。但是后来却碰了钉子，说我“不该对抗领导”。一九五九年以后，我又四次被送到彭真把持的旧北京市委所办的党校中去“学习”，在那里，学员们人人要检查过去“对抗领导”的“错误”，受到系统的“驯服工具论”的毒害。
    无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，广大革命群众高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，奋起大造党内一小撮走资派的反，我由于中“驯服工具论”的毒很深，在运动初期站错了队。后来，随着运动的发展，革命群众揭发出大量惊心动魄的事实，我才越来越清楚地看到以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮党内走资派，怎样披着共产党员的外衣，干着疯狂颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当。他们叫嚷要当党的“驯服工具”，原来是要蒙骗我们充当他们这伙隐藏在党内的一小撮走资派复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”！当我觉悟到这一点时，我就主动靠近革命群众，一面接受群众的教育帮助，一面又同群众一起，在毛主席的伟大号令下，杀上阶级斗争的第一线。
