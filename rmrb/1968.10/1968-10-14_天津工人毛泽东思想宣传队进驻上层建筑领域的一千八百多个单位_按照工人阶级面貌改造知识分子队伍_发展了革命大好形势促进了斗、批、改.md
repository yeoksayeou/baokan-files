Tianjin Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams Enter Over 1,800 Units in the Superstructure
Transform Knowledge Intellectuals into the Image of the Working Class
Develop the Revolutionary Favorable Situation and Promote the Struggle, Criticism, and Reform

New China News Agency, Tianjin, October 13th — After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest directive that "the working class must lead everything," the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee dispatched workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, mainly composed of industrial workers, with the participation and support of the People's Liberation Army, to enter over 1,800 units in the superstructure. The working class has taken the stage in the struggle, criticism, and reform of the superstructure, using Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals and transforming these units in the image of the proletariat. This has strongly consolidated and developed the revolutionary favorable situation in these units, promoting their struggle, criticism, and reform.

Currently, the units where the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have entered are experiencing increasingly good revolutionary situations. Their characteristics are: the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has occupied all positions in the superstructure, including all cultural domains, breaking the monopoly of intellectuals; the working class is transforming the intellectual contingent in its own image, re-educating intellectuals, and making them determined to follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers; the working class has raised its political consciousness through struggle.

Since mid-August this year, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams from various parts of Tianjin have successively entered units in the superstructure. They have all placed the rapid propagation and comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives and the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin in the most important position. Under the guidance of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, various units have universally held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The members of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams have used their profound proletarian feelings of loving the great leader Chairman Mao and their personal experiences of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives to influence and educate the broad masses of intellectuals, enhancing their love for the great leader Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The two major revolutionary mass organizations of Nankai University, which made important contributions in the cultural revolution, had long been embroiled in internal strife due to the instigation of class enemies and the mischief of bourgeois factionalism, becoming a "hard nut" in Tianjin. After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams entered the school, they guided the broad revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's latest directives, helped them criticize the reactionary "multi-center means no center" theory, criticize bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, and eliminated the estrangement between the two major revolutionary mass organizations. They united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, exposed some hidden class enemies, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the school.

Following Chairman Mao's latest directives on re-educating intellectuals, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams helped intellectuals transform their worldviews and change their bourgeois ideas and styles, following the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams universally held class education exhibitions and held bitter-sweet remembrance meetings. Worker comrades took the podium to give bitter-sweet remembrance reports, conducting class education for intellectuals. The broad teachers and students of Tianjin Institute of Technology, under the guidance of the workers' propaganda teams, carried out activities of "three remembrances, three comparisons, and three examinations": remembrance of the bitterness of the old society, comparison of the sweetness of the new society, and examination of one's forgetful thoughts; remembrance of the harm caused by the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, comparison of the sweetness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and examination of one's performance in the struggle between the two lines; remembrance of the cultivation by the Party and Chairman Mao, comparison of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and examination of whether one follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. These activities greatly raised the class consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students. They all expressed their determination to accept the re-education of the working class honestly, to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to be forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, to thoroughly reform old ideas, and to temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. In recent months, Tianjin has sent nearly 10,000 college graduates and 38,000 high school graduates to the countryside, to the border, to factories and mines, and to the grassroots to participate in labor and accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, following the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams mobilized the masses extensively, deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that the Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the fields of education, literature and arts, and journalism, and carried out universal and thorough reforms on all superstructures that do not fit the socialist economic base according to the proletarian image. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses further realized that the phenomenon of the bourgeois ruling the cultural and educational front and implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the laboring people could no longer continue. Under the leadership of the workers' propaganda teams, they dug out a handful of class enemies in the cultural and educational fields and began to carry out universal and thorough reforms on the superstructure. At the same time, a proletarian force is taking shape on the cultural and educational front.

In the process of leading these units in struggle, criticism, and reform, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian policies towards intellectuals, did thorough and detailed political and ideological work on them, mobilized all positive factors, united all forces that could be united, and turned negative factors into positive ones. The workers' propaganda teams that entered colleges and universities fully affirmed the merits of the broad revolutionary Red Guards in the early and middle stages of the cultural revolution, while patiently and enthusiastically educating them on various mistakes they made, helping them to develop their strengths, overcome their weaknesses, summarize their experiences, and continue to advance. In this way, each unit has emerged a large number of activists determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, uniting the majority of the masses, consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, isolating and striking a small handful of class enemies.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in Tianjin also followed Chairman Mao's great teachings that "the working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in struggle," and focused on building their own revolutionary cause. They studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, took the People's Liberation Army as an example, extensively carried out the "four-good" company movement, insisted on the four firsts, promoted the three-eight style, practiced the three great democracies, and implemented the three major disciplines and eight points for attention. They deeply carried out the "three loyalties" activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, continuously raising their political consciousness in struggle.

	Driving the propaganda team of Jilin Industrial University, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams conducted thorough and detailed ideological and political work, enthusiastically helping revolutionary teachers and students to establish the style of combining theory with practice, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and better comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of the school. This is an old worker, Chen Detian, introducing to revolutionary teachers and students his experience of studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, learning a bit and using a bit, and combining theory with practice.

    天津工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻上层建筑领域的一千八百多个单位
    按照工人阶级面貌改造知识分子队伍
    发展了革命大好形势促进了斗、批、改
    新华社天津十三日电　伟大领袖毛主席发出“工人阶级必须领导一切”的最新指示以后，天津市革命委员会派出以产业工人为主体的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在人民解放军的参加和支持下，进驻了上层建筑领域的一千八百多个单位。工人阶级登上了上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台，用毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育，用无产阶级的面貌对这些单位进行改造，有力地巩固和发展了这些单位的革命大好形势，促进了这些单位的斗、批、改。
    目前，工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻的单位，革命形势越来越好，它们的特点是：战无不胜的毛泽东思想占领了上层建筑其中包括各个文化领域的一切阵地，打破了知识分子独霸的一统天下；工人阶级用自己的面貌改造着知识分子队伍，对知识分子进行了再教育，使广大知识分子决心走与工农兵相结合的道路；工人阶级在斗争中提高了自己的政治觉悟。
    天津市各工人毛泽东思想宣传队从今年八月中旬起陆续进入上层建筑各单位以后，都把迅速宣传、全面落实毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，摆在头等重要的地位。在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，各单位普遍地举办了毛泽东思想学习班。工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志用自己无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，用自己紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署、坚决落实毛主席最新指示的亲身感受，去影响和教育广大知识分子，增强他们对伟大领袖毛主席、对毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的热爱。在无产阶级文化大革命中做出重要贡献的南开大学两大派革命群众组织，由于受阶级敌人的挑拨和资产阶级派性作怪，长期“内战”不休，成为天津市的“老大难”单位。工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校后，引导广大革命师生学习毛主席的最新指示，帮助他们批判反动的“多中心即无中心论”，批判资产阶级派性和无政府主义，使两大派革命群众组织消除了隔阂，在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，揪出了一些隐藏的阶级敌人，全校迅速实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队遵照毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示，帮助知识分子改造世界观，改变资产阶级的思想、作风，走与工农兵相结合的道路。工人毛泽东思想宣传队普遍举办了阶级教育展览会，召开忆苦思甜大会，工人群众登上讲坛，作忆苦思甜的报告，对知识分子进行阶级教育。天津工学院的广大师生，在工人宣传队的帮助下，开展了“三忆、三比、三查”活动，忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，查自己的忘本思想；忆受中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒害，比执行毛主席无产阶级教育路线的甜，查自己在两条路线斗争中的表现；忆党和毛主席对自己的培养，比对伟大领袖毛主席的忠心，查自己是否紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。这些活动，极大地提高了广大革命师生的阶级觉悟。他们纷纷表示：决心在工人阶级的领导下，老老实实地接受工农兵的再教育，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，走与工农兵相结合的道路，彻底改造旧思想，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。近几个月来，天津市已有近万名大专院校毕业生和三万八千多名中学毕业生，遵照毛主席指引的道路，到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，参加劳动，接受工农兵的再教育。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，广泛发动群众，深入地批判中国赫鲁晓夫在教育、文艺、新闻等领域内推行的反革命修正主义路线，按照无产阶级的面貌，对一切不适合于社会主义经济基础的上层建筑实行普遍的、彻底的改革。通过革命大批判，广大革命群众进一步认识到：资产阶级统治文化教育阵地，对劳动人民实行资产阶级专政的现象，再也不能继续下去了。他们在工人宣传队领导下，深挖出文化教育领域内的一小撮阶级敌人，开始对上层建筑进行普遍的、彻底的改革。同时，一支无产阶级的队伍正在文化教育战线上形成。
    在领导这些单位斗、批、改的过程中，工人毛泽东思想宣传队坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于对待知识分子的无产阶级政策，深入细致地对他们做政治思想工作，调动一切积极因素，团结一切可以团结的力量，并把消极因素变成积极因素。进驻大专院校和中学的工人宣传队，充分肯定了广大革命的红卫兵小将在文化大革命初期和中期立下的功绩，同时对他们所犯的这样那样的错误，进行热情耐心的教育，帮助他们发扬成绩，克服缺点，总结经验，继续前进。这样，各单位都涌现出一大批决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的积极分子，团结大多数群众，巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    天津市工人毛泽东思想宣传队还遵照毛主席关于“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的伟大教导，狠抓本身的革命化建设。他们活学活用毛泽东思想，以解放军为榜样，广泛地开展“四好连队”运动，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，执行三大纪律八项注意，深入地开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，使自己在斗争中不断提高政治觉悟。
