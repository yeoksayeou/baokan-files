Workers in Palermo, Italy, Stage General Strike

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, workers in Palermo, the capital of Sicily in southern Italy, held a general strike on the 25th to protest against the ruthless exploitation by the monopoly bourgeoisie, demanding wage increases and full employment. Students in Palermo also held a general boycott to support the workers' just struggle. As a result, all factories, dockyards, schools, and transportation in the entire city of Palermo were paralyzed.

For a long time, Italian monopoly capitalists have taken advantage of the severe unemployment and poverty in southern regions like Sicily to suppress workers' wages and squeeze out more profits. The severe earthquake that occurred in Sicily in January this year further deepened the suffering of the local working people. The urban and rural laborers in this region have repeatedly launched waves of strikes and demonstrations over the past few months. On the 25th, 15,000 workers and thousands of students in Palermo held a mass rally in the city center, followed by a demonstration march through the city. Students hoisted a vibrant red flag on the roof of the central post office in the city center.

    意大利巴勒莫市工人举行总罢工
    据新华社二十七日讯　罗马消息：意大利南部西西里区首府巴勒莫的工人，二十五日举行总罢工，反对垄断资产阶级的残酷剥削，要求增加工资和充分就业。巴勒莫的学生同时举行总罢课，支持工人的正义斗争。巴勒莫全市的工厂、船坞、学校和交通因此都陷于瘫痪状态。
    长期以来，意大利垄断资本家利用意大利南部西西里等地区存在的严重的失业和贫困的状况，竭力压低工人的工资，榨取更多的利润。今年一月在西西里区发生的猛烈地震，又加深了当地劳动人民的苦难。这个地区城乡的劳动人民，几个月来一再掀起了罢工和示威的怒潮。二十五日，巴勒莫一万五千工人和数千学生在市中心举行群众大会，接着在市区举行了示威游行。学生们在市中心邮政总局的屋顶上升起了一面鲜艳的红旗。
