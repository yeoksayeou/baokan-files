The military support team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Zhangjiakou Chemical Factory, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "never forgetting class struggle" and "humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress," used Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new situation, characteristics, and trends of class struggle. They saw the unrest beneath the surface calm and firmly grasped the initiative in the class struggle. They armed the workers with Mao Zedong Thought, united the majority of cadres and masses, and struck down a handful of class enemies with precision and force. They purified and consolidated the class ranks, eliminated the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism, and the situation in the entire factory has become increasingly better.

Seeing the Unrest Beneath the Surface Calm

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Zhangjiakou Chemical Factory, the situation in the entire factory was excellent. Under these circumstances, some comrades thought: the overall situation is settled, and victory is imminent. Others said: the capitalist roaders in our factory have become like "grasshoppers in autumn," with no more room to jump. In the struggle against the enemy, some comrades also developed a sense of dependence. They said: "If the leadership points them out, we will criticize them."

Under these circumstances, the military support team and the members of the Revolutionary Committee jointly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and the brilliant philosophical thoughts of dialectical materialism. They organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the theme "never forget class struggle." In the study class, they organized everyone to use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new situation, characteristics, and trends of class struggle. They saw the unrest beneath the surface calm, thoroughly discussed the reality of class struggle in the factory, and thoroughly examined their own enemy awareness. They did not realize until they discussed it, and when they discussed it, they were shocked. A capitalist roader who had been exposed for more than a year and had been criticized many times was still plotting a comeback during the purification of the class ranks, hoping that the Revolutionary Committee would rehabilitate him. The living reality of class struggle opened the eyes of the revolutionary masses, and everyone clearly saw: there is unrest beneath the surface calm. The tigers in the iron cage are still struggling, and the grasshoppers in autumn are still struggling. The process of developing and consolidating the Revolutionary Committee is a serious process of class struggle. We must not be complacent and negligent because of victory and relax the struggle against the enemy. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new situation of class struggle, grasp the initiative in the class struggle, and advance victoriously.

Striking the Enemy Hard to Protect the People

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Actual struggles made them realize: only by striking down a handful of class enemies can we better protect the broad revolutionary masses and safeguard the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the establishment of the factory Revolutionary Committee, the flames of revolutionary criticism burned fiercely, and the work of purifying the class ranks was in full swing. At this time, a class enemy in the factory spread rumors, saying: "Those who stood on the wrong side in the Cultural Revolution will all be purified in the purification of the class ranks. If you are not sent to the border for labor, you will be expelled and sent back home to produce." Some comrades who had once stood on the wrong side in the movement had performed well in the previous phase of purifying the class ranks, but after hearing the class enemy's rumors, they added a "fear" to their hearts and became silent in the struggle against the enemy; some individuals with general historical problems carried the burden of thought and stood outside the circle of the struggle against the enemy, awaiting disposal.

Facing this situation, the military support team and the factory Revolutionary Committee realized: to unite the broad masses, we must strike down a handful of class enemies. They then organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, launched a sustained attack on the class enemies, exposed the factory's unrepentant capitalist roaders, and revealed the true face of the class enemy who spread rumors and confused the people, smashing their evil plot to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They then, in conjunction with the new situation of class struggle in the factory, dragged a handful of class enemies to the workshops and teams for criticism, which greatly raised the awareness of the two-line struggle among the broad masses and educated and united the broad masses.

Turning Negative Factors into Positive Ones

During a criticism meeting, a young worker who had made serious mistakes in the movement was prepared to expose the class enemy, but when he stood up to speak, seeing all the workers in the factory looking at him, he suddenly sat down again. At this time, some comrades felt that he had not drawn a clear line with the class enemy and were very angry, advocating that he be "cooked together" with the class enemy and given a hard lesson. The military support team and the members of the Revolutionary Committee seriously analyzed and studied the reasons for the young worker's hesitation, and it turned out that this young worker had done some things harmful to the people in the Cultural Revolution. In addition, some revolutionary workers treated him coldly, making him feel very pressured.

In the purification of the class ranks, why did some cadres still show signs of replacing party policies with personal feelings when the movement deepened? The military support team and the members of the Revolutionary Committee studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "when the masses know the truth and have a common goal, they will unite to do it." They realized: it is not enough for just the military support team and the members of the Revolutionary Committee to grasp and use the one-divides-into-two viewpoint; they must also mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to learn and use the one-divides-into-two viewpoint well. Only in this way can negative factors be turned into positive ones. The Revolutionary Committee then helped everyone see the side of those who had made serious mistakes that wanted to revolutionize, helped them put down their burdens and stand up to revolutionize, turning negative factors into positive ones.

Next, the military support team and the members of the Revolutionary Committee organized the broad revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's teaching that "things in the world are complex and are determined by various factors. When looking at problems, one must look at them from various aspects and not just from one aspect." They helped everyone to look at problems comprehensively and historically, preventing the simple negation of comrades who had made serious mistakes, and not seeing their past achievements and positive factors. The military support team inspired the revolutionary masses to realize: advancement and backwardness are not absolute but can transform into each other. Some can become better and better, some can go from good to bad, and some can go from bad to good.

After their awareness was raised, everyone voluntarily raised the transformation of their worldview to the height of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines, actively engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. They said: "Only by overthrowing the 'self' in one's mind and establishing 'publicness' can one have a thorough revolutionary spirit, be as ruthless to the enemy as Comrade Deng Zhihui, be kind to comrades, be strict with oneself, unite the broad masses, and always direct the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of class enemies." Many revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "carrying out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," actively sought out the young worker for heart-to-heart talks. The young worker was deeply moved and, in the struggle against the enemy, not only exposed a large number of evil facts of the class enemy but also made a soul-searching self-criticism, gaining the understanding of the masses and also educating the masses.

At present, the situation of the struggle against the enemy in the Zhangjiakou Chemical Factory is excellent. The stationed military and the Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the broad workers, use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new situation of class struggle, fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, make the flames of revolutionary criticism burn more fiercely, deepen the work of purifying the class ranks, and make the revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory increasingly better.

    用毛主席的光辉哲学思想武装群众  牢牢掌握对敌斗争的主动权
    张家口市化工厂清理阶级队伍工作步步深入，革命和生产形势越来越好
    解放军某部驻张家口市化工厂支左人员，遵照毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，运用毛主席的唯物辩证法，分析阶级斗争新形势，新特点，新动向，从平静中看到不平静，牢牢掌握阶级斗争的主动权；用毛泽东思想武装工人，团结干部和群众的大多数，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，纯洁和巩固了阶级队伍，肃清反革命修正主义的流毒，全厂形势越来越好。
    从平静中看到不平静
    张家口市化工厂革委会成立以后，全厂形势一片大好。在这种情况下，有些同志认为：大局已定，面临全胜。也有的说：咱们厂的走资派已经成了“秋后的蚂蚱”，没有多大蹦跶头了。在对敌斗争中，有些群众还产生依赖思想。他们说：“领导点名，我们就批。”
    在这种情况下，解放军支左人员和革委会委员共同学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导和辩证唯物主义的光辉哲学思想，并举办了以“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”为专题的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，他们组织大家运用毛主席的唯物辩证法的光辉思想，分析阶级斗争的新形势，新特点，新动向，从平静中看到不平静，大摆本厂阶级斗争的现实，大查自己的敌情观念。不摆不知道，一摆吓一跳。一个被揪出一年多的走资派，已被批斗过多次，在清理阶级队伍的时候却在伺机反扑，妄想让革委会给他平反。活生生的阶级斗争现实擦亮了广大革命群众的眼睛，大家清楚地看到：在平静中有不平静，铁笼里的老虎，依然困兽犹斗，秋后的蚂蚱，还在作最后的挣扎。革命委员会发展和巩固的过程，是一个严重的阶级斗争的过程，决不能因为胜利，就骄傲麻痹，放松对敌斗争。必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，经常用毛泽东思想分析阶级斗争的新形势，掌握阶级斗争主动权，乘胜前进。
    对敌人狠才能对人民亲
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”实际斗争使他们认识到：只有狠狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，才能更好地保护广大革命群众，保卫无产阶级专政。厂革委会成立后，革命大批判的烈火熊熊燃烧，清理阶级队伍的工作如火如荼。这时候，厂内有一个阶级敌人却大肆散布流言蜚语，胡说什么：“在文化大革命中站错队的人，在清理阶级队伍时，都要进行清理。不让你到边疆去劳动，也得把你开除，叫你回家生产。”有些在运动中一度站错队的同志，在前一阶段清理阶级队伍中本来表现很好，但听到阶级敌人的谣言以后，心里添了一个“怕”字，在对敌斗争中由积极变沉默；个别有一般历史问题的人背起了思想包袱，站在对敌斗争的圈外，听候处理。
    面对这种情况，驻厂支左人员和厂革委会认识到：要团结广大群众，必须狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人。于是就举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想武装群众，向阶级敌人发动了持续的进攻，揪出了厂内死不悔改的走资派，揭露了那个造谣惑众的阶级敌人的真面目，粉碎了他们破坏毛主席伟大战略部署的罪恶阴谋。接着结合厂里阶级斗争新形势，把一小撮阶级敌人拉到车间、班组进行批判，有力地提高了广大群众的两条路线斗争觉悟，教育和团结了广大群众。
    化消极因素为积极因素
    在一次批判大会上，一个在运动中犯有严重错误的青年工人，准备揭发阶级敌人，但是，站起来刚要开口，看到全厂工人都在看着他，突然又坐下了。这时，有的群众觉得他和阶级敌人划不清界限，感到很气愤，主张把他和阶级敌人“一勺烩”，狠狠地触一下他的灵魂。支左人员和革委会成员一起认真分析研究了这个青年工人犹豫不决的原因，原来这个青年工人在文化大革命中做过一些不利于人民的事，再加上有的革命工人对他态度冷淡，使他感到压力很大。
    在清理阶级队伍时，天天讲党的方针政策，为什么运动向纵深发展的时候，有的骨干还出现以感情代替党的政策的苗头呢？支左人员和革委会成员学习了毛主席关于“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做”的教导，认识到：光支左人员和革委会成员掌握运用一分为二的观点是不够的，还必须发动广大革命群众学好、用好一分为二的观点，这样才有利于化消极因素为积极因素。于是，革委会便帮助大家从犯有严重错误的人身上，看到他们愿意革命的一方面，帮助他们放下包袱站起来革命，使消极因素转化为积极因素。
    接着，支左人员和革委会成员组织广大革命群众学习毛主席“世界上的事情是复杂的，是由各方面的因素决定的。看问题要从各方面去看，不能只从单方面看”的教导，帮助大家全面地历史地看问题，防止简单地把犯过严重错误的同志一概否定，看不到他们过去的成绩和积极因素。支左人员启发革命群众认识到：先进和落后不是绝对的，是会互相转化的，有的会越变越好，有的会由好变坏，也有的会由坏变好。
    认识提高以后，大家自觉地把世界观的改造提高到两个阶级和两条路线斗争的高度，主动斗私批修。他们说：“只有在自己头脑中打倒‘私’字，树立‘公’字，才能有彻底的革命精神，象门合同志那样对敌狠，对同志和，对己严，团结广大群众，把斗争的矛头始终对准一小撮阶级敌人。”不少革命群众根据毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，纷纷找那个青年工人谈心。那个青年工人深受感动，在对敌斗争中，不仅揭发了阶级敌人的大量罪恶事实，而且还作了触及灵魂的检查，取得了群众的谅解，也教育了群众。
    目前，张家口市化工厂对敌斗争形势一片大好，驻厂解放军和革委会紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，运用毛主席的哲学思想，武装广大工人，用毛泽东思想分析阶级斗争新形势，充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，使革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，清理阶级队伍的工作步步深入，全厂革命、生产形势越来越好。
