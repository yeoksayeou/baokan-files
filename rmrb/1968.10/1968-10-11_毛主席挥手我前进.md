Chairman Mao waves and I advance

	Navy Lieutenant Guo Zhen

	Thousands of golden rays illuminate the four seas, cheers echo like thunder, and tears well up in our eyes. Our great leader Chairman Mao, with steady steps, a radiant face, and a spirited demeanor, received the representatives of the first Navy conference on actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. When our great leader Chairman Mao approached the iron warrior Mei Xiande, he smiled benevolently, extending his mighty hand, which manages countless affairs and turns the world upside down, to firmly grasp the hands of the iron warrior Mei Xiande...

	What a moving scene! What an unforgettable moment!

	Chairman Mao! Gazing at your mighty hand, we navy soldiers feel a surge of warmth in our hearts, and our thoughts flow like a river, our imaginations soar. Nineteen years ago, it was your strong and powerful hands that personally created the young People's Navy. In February 1953, under the most brilliant spring sunshine, you personally inspected the navy's fleet, shaking hands with and taking photos with the sailors of the "Changjiang," "Luoyang," and other ships, living together for four days and three nights. It was your "pointing to the rivers and mountains" mighty hand that wrote the glorious inscription for the navy: "To oppose imperialist aggression, we must definitely build a powerful navy." These twenty-three golden characters illuminated the ten thousand li of our country's coasts, guiding our victorious course forward! How many times have you waved your mighty hand from Tiananmen, and the red sailors proudly accepted your inspection? How many times have you warmly waved and greeted us, the revolutionary soldiers from the coastal defense front, in the Great Hall of the People? Today, your mighty hand is grasping the hands of the red mechanic Mei Xiande, pouring out your immense concern and trust for the navy soldiers. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Every inch of the People's Navy's journey forward is guided by your steady hand at the helm; every victory of the People's Navy shines with the brilliant light of your military thoughts and military line!

	Mei Xiande's hands tightly grasp the hands of the great commander, and heartfelt words well up. Chairman Mao! The red sailors love you the most, are the most loyal to you, believe in you the most, and admire you the most. It was your brilliant thoughts that made Mei Xiande, despite being seriously injured, continue fighting for three hours; it was your great thoughts that made this iron warrior overcome his injuries in the hospital and stand up again to live and fight! It was your patient instructions that made this mechanic, who had been in the hospital for two years, successfully start the ship's engine with skilled movements. Mei Xiande is a hero in battle and a pioneer in the great criticism. Mei Xiande's five large characters, "Long Live Chairman Mao," written with his left hand, express the strongest sentiments of all navy soldiers!

	"Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Looking at Comrade Lin Biao's glorious inscription and recalling the scene of Chairman Mao warmly shaking hands with Mei Xiande, we deeply feel the great leader's immense concern for revolutionary soldiers and the revolutionary soldiers' boundless love for the great leader. Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force, fearing neither hardship nor death, daring to brave fire and water, and invincible!

	We navy soldiers will take Comrade Lin Biao as our example, forever be loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, advancing victoriously along the course opened by Chairman Mao!

    毛主席挥手我前进
    海军某部排长  郭振
    万道金光照四海，欢声雷动泪盈眶。我们伟大领袖毛主席，迈着稳健的步伐，红光满面，神采奕奕，接见了海军首次活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表。当伟大领袖毛主席走到钢铁战士麦贤得面前时，他慈祥地微笑着，伸出那只日理万机、扭转乾坤的巨手，和钢铁战士麦贤得的双手紧紧地相握……。
    这是一个多么激动人心的场面！多么令人难忘的镜头！
    毛主席呵！望着您的巨手，我们海军战士心中激荡起一股股暖流，禁不住思潮滚滚，浮想联翩。十九年前，正是您这双坚强有力的巨手，亲手缔造了年轻的人民海军。一九五三年二月，在无比灿烂的春光里，您老人家亲自视察海军舰艇部队，和“长江”、“洛阳”等军舰的水兵亲切握手，合影留念，共同生活了四天三夜。是您那只“指点江山”的巨手，为海军写下了光辉的题词：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”这二十三个金光闪闪的大字，照红了祖国的万里海疆，指引着我们胜利前进的航向！多少次，您在天安门上挥巨手，红水兵光荣地接受您的检阅；多少次，您在人民大会堂亲切地招手致意，接见我们来自海防前线的革命战士。今天，您的巨手又握着红色轮机兵——麦贤得的双手，倾注了您对海军战士的莫大关怀，莫大信任。毛主席呵，毛主席！人民海军前进的每一寸航程，都是您老人家紧握舵轮、亲手指引；人民海军取得的每一个胜利，都闪耀着您的建军思想和建军路线的灿烂光辉！
    麦贤得的手，紧紧握着伟大统帅的手，贴心的话儿涌心头。毛主席呵！红水兵对您最热爱，最忠诚，最信仰，最崇拜。是您的光辉思想，使麦贤得在头负重伤的情况下，坚持战斗达三小时之久；是您的伟大思想，使这个钢铁战士在医院里战胜重伤，重新顽强地站起来生活、战斗！是您的谆谆教导，使这个住院两年的轮机兵，仍然以熟练的动作成功地开动了舰艇的机器。麦贤得在战斗中是英雄，在革命大批判中是闯将。麦贤得用左手写出的“毛主席万岁”五个大字，表达了全体海军战士最强烈的心声！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”望着林副主席的光辉题词，回想起毛主席和麦贤得亲切握手的镜头，我们深深感到伟大领袖对革命战士的巨大关怀和革命战士对伟大领袖的无限热爱。大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力，不怕苦，不怕死，赴汤蹈火，所向无敌！
    我们海军战士要以林副主席为榜样，永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席，永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，沿着毛主席开辟的航道胜利前进！
