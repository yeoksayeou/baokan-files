The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Sun Yat-sen Medical College, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the working class must continuously raise its political consciousness in struggle," and with the support and cooperation of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, has vigorously promoted the revolutionary transformation of the entire team. This has effectively advanced the thought revolutionization of all team members, enhancing their sense of responsibility and awareness in carrying out the proletarian educational revolution to the end.

The leadership of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Sun Yat-sen Medical College, with the help of the PLA, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "implementing the proletarian educational revolution, which must be led by the working class and must involve the participation of the working masses." They realized that the workers' propaganda team must shoulder the great historical mission of transforming intellectuals and leading the proletarian educational revolution according to Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, every member of the propaganda team must be a revolutionary fighter armed with Mao Zedong Thought and with a high level of political consciousness. Thus, after entering the school, the propaganda team focused on its own revolutionary transformation while leading the school's struggle, criticism, and reform. Their main practices are as follows:

1. Arm the minds of all team members with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Upon entering Sun Yat-sen Medical College, the workers' propaganda team placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the earnest implementation of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. They arranged work by first arranging the study of Chairman Mao's works, checked work by first checking the situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and summarized work by first summarizing the effects of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. All team members insist on reading the "Three Articles" every day, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions. They particularly emphasized the study and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Whenever Chairman Mao issued a new instruction, they organized the team members to study it, ensuring that the instruction was conveyed without delay, followed closely without falling behind, and executed without deviation. Recently, after Chairman Mao's instructions on re-educating intellectuals were issued, they studied them overnight, vigorously propagated them, and actively organized revolutionary teachers and students to have in-depth discussions. The workers' propaganda team also brought Chairman Mao's latest instructions to various classes and had heart-to-heart talks with teachers and students.

The workers' propaganda team members, with profound proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, carried out the "Three Loyalties" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They unanimously declared that they would not disappoint Chairman Mao's care and trust and would definitely lead the educational revolution in the school well.

Old worker Jiang Fa, who has reached retirement age, said: "Although I am old, my revolutionary spirit will never age. I will not retire until I complete the glorious task given by Chairman Mao to the working class to lead the school's struggle, criticism, and reform."

2. Emphasize proletarian politics, address active thoughts, and continuously raise the political consciousness of team members.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The working class must transform the entire society in class struggle and in the struggle against nature, and at the same time transform itself. The working class must continuously learn in its work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and never stop." The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Sun Yat-sen Medical College, following Chairman Mao's teachings, addressed the active thoughts of team members in their actual work, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to conduct timely political and ideological education, effectively promoting the thought revolutionization of team members.

After entering the school, some team members had difficulties in their assigned work, fearing that their low education level would make the work difficult. To address this active thought, the propaganda team organized team members to seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions on the working class leading everything. Through the study, team members enhanced their confidence in leading the school's educational revolution. Old worker Liu Bingneng, who is illiterate, was assigned to work in the college's political department after entering the school and initially had difficulties. Through study, he overcame his difficulties. He said: "My personal abilities are limited, but the power of Mao Zedong Thought is boundless." He boldly carried out his work, actively sought out cadres for heart-to-heart talks, and used his personal experiences to conduct class education for the cadres of the political department, making the work of the political department very lively. Everyone praised him as the "master of political work."

The leadership of the workers' propaganda team took the lead in doing in-depth and detailed political and ideological work, and regularly studied the active thoughts of team members. In addition to establishing various regular meetings to solve the active thoughts of team members, they also mobilized team members to carry out heart-to-heart and mutual assistance activities, with everyone doing political and ideological work, ensuring that active thoughts appearing among team members were solved in a timely manner, keeping the entire propaganda team always full of spirit and fighting spirit.

3. Arm oneself with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, vigorously promote the thought revolutionization of the propaganda team's leadership.

Chairman Mao teaches: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." After entering the school, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Sun Yat-sen Medical College, following Chairman Mao's teachings, vigorously promoted the thought revolutionization of the leadership, continuously raised the policy level, and led all team members in the complicated class struggle to lead the school's struggle, criticism, and reform well. After entering the school, the leadership of the workers' propaganda team seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and Yao Wenyuan's article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything," deeply realizing that the workers' propaganda team shouldered a very glorious yet arduous task. In their work, they advocated the Party's three great styles of work, adopted the method of dividing areas for responsibility, and often had half of the leadership members directly go to the front line with the team members to study and fight, enabling the propaganda team to discover problems in a timely manner, summarize experiences, and improve work.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party. All levels of leadership must fully pay attention to this and never be careless." The leadership of the workers' propaganda team paid great attention to studying and mastering the Party's policies and guidelines, and also organized team members to improve their policy level through study.

The leadership of the workers' propaganda team, after entering the school, strictly required themselves in everything, setting an example in learning, propagating, executing, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They worked hard with a spirit of dedication, setting a good example for all team members.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Sun Yat-sen Medical College also took the PLA as an example, vigorously carrying out the movement to create excellent propaganda teams and excellent team members, raising the thought revolutionization of all team members to a new level.

    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装队员  在斗争中不断提高工人的政治觉悟
    驻广州中山医学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队狠抓宣传队本身的革命化建设，把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，不断提高政策水平，带领队员搞好学校的斗批改
    新华社广州十日电　进驻广州中山医学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的教导，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的支持和配合下，狠抓宣传队本身的革命化建设，有力地促进了全体队员的思想革命化，提高了队员把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的责任心和自觉性。
    驻中山医学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导成员，在解放军帮助下，反复学习了毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的最新指示，认识到工人宣传队要担负起按照毛泽东思想改造知识分子，领导无产阶级教育革命的伟大历史任务，宣传队的每个队员就必须是用毛泽东思想武装起来的、具有高度政治觉悟的革命战士。因此，宣传队进校以后在领导学校斗、批、改中，狠抓了本身的革命化建设。他们的主要做法是：
    一、用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装全体队员的头脑。
    工人宣传队一进中山医学院，就把活学活用毛主席著作、认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，布置工作首先布置毛主席著作的学习，检查工作首先检查活学活用毛主席著作的情况，总结工作首先总结活学活用毛主席著作的效果。全体队员坚持天天读“老三篇”，用毛泽东思想统帅自己的行动。他们特别重视学习和落实毛主席的最新指示。毛主席的每一个最新指示一发表，他们就组织队员们学习，做到传达不过夜，紧跟不掉队，执行不走样。最近，毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的指示发表后，他们连夜学习，大张旗鼓地进行宣传，积极组织广大革命师生深入座谈讨论，工人宣传队还带着毛主席的最新指示深入各班级和师生们开展谈心活动。
    工人宣传队队员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，开展了忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动。他们一致表示，决不辜负毛主席的关怀和信任，一定领导好学校的教育革命。
    老工人江发已经到了退休的年龄，他说：“我虽然年老了，但是革命的红心永不老，不完成毛主席交给工人阶级领导学校斗、批、改的光荣任务，坚决不退休。”
    二、突出无产阶级政治，狠抓活思想，不断提高队员的政治觉悟。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”驻中山医学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队遵照毛主席的教导，针对队员在实际工作中出现的活思想，以毛泽东思想为武器，及时进行思想政治教育，有力地促进了队员的思想革命化。
    工人宣传队进校以后，有的队员对自己担负的工作有畏难情绪，怕自己文化低，工作做不好。针对这种活思想，宣传队组织队员认真学习了毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的指示。通过学习，队员们增强了一定能领导好学校教育革命的信心。老工人刘炳能，不识字，进校后分配在学院政治部工作，开始有畏难情绪，通过学习，畏难情绪克服了。他说：“靠我个人能力有限，靠毛泽东思想威力无穷。”他大胆开展工作，主动找干部谈心，用自己的切身经历对学院政治部的干部进行阶级教育，使政治部的工作开展得很活跃，大家称赞他是“做政治工作的老师傅”。
    工人宣传队的领导成员带头做深入细致的思想政治工作，并定期研究队员的活思想，他们除建立了各种经常性的解决队员活思想的会议制度外，还发动队员开展谈心互助活动，人人做思想政治工作，保证队员中出现的活思想能及时解决，使整个宣传队始终情绪饱满，斗志旺盛。
    三、以毛主席最新指示武装自己，狠抓宣传队领导班子的思想革命化。
    毛主席教导说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”驻中山医学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校以后遵照毛主席的教导，狠抓领导班子的思想革命化，不断提高政策水平，带领全体队员在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，领导好学校的斗、批、改。进校以后，工人宣传队的领导成员认真学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示和姚文元同志的文章《工人阶级必须领导一切》，深刻认识到，工人宣传队肩负着极其光荣而又艰巨的任务。他们在工作中大兴党的三大作风，采取分片包干的办法，经常都有一半领导成员直接深入到第一线和队员一道学习战斗，使宣传队能及时发现问题，总结经验，改进工作。
    毛主席教导说：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”工人宣传队的领导班子很注意学习和掌握党的方针政策，并注意组织队员通过学习提高政策水平。
    工人宣传队的领导成员进校后处处注意严格要求自己，以身作则，做学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛主席最新指示的带头人。他们埋头苦干，任劳任怨的工作作风，为全体队员树立了良好的榜样。
    驻中山医学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队还以解放军为榜样，大力开展创造四好宣传队和五好队员的比学赶帮运动，把全体队员的思想革命化提高到了新的水平。
