Albanian Representative Delivers a Righteous Speech at the United Nations, Strongly Condemning the Collusion of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Attempting to Divide the World

The revisionist traitor clique of the Soviet Union, in return for the U.S. imperialists' tacit approval of its invasion of Czechoslovakia, is now using various tricks to serve the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception, forcing the Vietnamese people to surrender. In the Middle East, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are tightening their collusion, attempting to impose a so-called "political solution" on the Arab peoples. These two imperialist countries not only divide the world into spheres of influence but also cooperate strategically and tactically to oppose the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

New China News Agency, October 18th: According to a report from the Albanian News Agency, on October 11th, the head of the Albanian People's Republic delegation to the United Nations, Harim Budo, spoke at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly. He deeply exposed and strongly condemned the collusion of the common enemies of the world's peoples, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, within and outside the United Nations, their treacherous efforts to divide the world anew, and their evil plots against the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

Budo pointed out that the United States and the Soviet revisionists, these two imperialist countries, not only divide the world into spheres of influence but also cooperate strategically and tactically. He pointed out that when the U.S.-Israel launched an armed attack on the Arab countries, the Soviet Union stood by and did nothing. In South America, the Soviet revisionists and their local lackeys advocate "coexistence" with the ruling cliques, while the U.S. imperialists carry out armed suppression of the revolutions that are springing up everywhere. In Vietnam, the Soviet revisionists advocate shameful surrender, while the Americans continue bombing day and night and expanding the war. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia was met with a tolerant attitude by the U.S. imperialists. This most clearly exposed the collusion of these two big powers, exposing their plans of aggression, whose purpose is to divide spheres of influence and dominate the world. This shows that this aggression is a link in their global strategic plan.

Budo strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's act of aggression against the Czechoslovak people. He said that this aggression exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique as opportunistic, adventurous traitors. The peoples of all countries strongly condemn this barbaric and shocking aggression, which tramples on the basic principles of relations between countries and creates a dangerous situation for the freedom and peace of Europe and the world.

Budo went on to say that the Soviet revisionists' invasion of Czechoslovakia fully proves that the Warsaw Pact has become a pact for enslavement and wars of aggression manipulated by the Soviet revisionist clique. The Albanian People's Republic's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact is of great significance both domestically and internationally, and is a crushing blow to the great-power chauvinism and aggression policies of the Khrushchev revisionists.

In exposing the Soviet revisionists' shameful actions in serving the U.S. imperialists on the Vietnam issue, Budo pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam has completely fallen into a desperate situation from which they cannot extricate themselves. The Johnson administration is now desperately trying to use the "peace talks" trap to get out of its predicament in Vietnam. The Soviet revisionists, in return for the U.S. imperialists' tacit approval of their invasion of Czechoslovakia, are making every effort and using various tricks to try to force the Vietnamese people to surrender to the aggressors. Budo emphasized that it is clear that the U.S. imperialists will not give up their plots of aggression against Vietnam. The facts have proven that the so-called limited bombing of North Vietnam is just a deception. He said that undoubtedly, any relaxation of vigilance against the evil plots of the U.S. and the Soviet Union can only encourage aggression. The Vietnamese people can only defeat the U.S. aggressors through armed struggle.

In discussing the situation in the Middle East, Budo said that since the U.S.-Israel aggression against the Arab countries last June, Arab territories are still under the occupation of Israeli aggressors, and Israel continues to carry out aggression and provocation against the Arab countries. The peace-loving peoples and countries of all continents are extremely angry at the culprits behind this situation—the United States and the Soviet Union. Budo pointed out that despite this, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are attempting to impose a so-called "political solution" on the Arab peoples, aiming to trample on the highest interests of the Arab peoples, their independence, and territorial integrity, and to encourage the Israeli aggressors to carry out their expansionist policies.

Budo strongly exposed the evil plots of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to form an anti-China military alliance. He pointed out that because the People's Republic of China is the steadfast and unshakable defender of the peoples of all countries who are fighting against imperialist aggression, oppression, and tyranny, it is the strongest and insurmountable obstacle to the realization of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists' counter-revolutionary plans to dominate the world. Therefore, while intensifying the suppression of the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists have strengthened their provocations against China and established an anti-China strategic encirclement, preparing to take aggressive actions against China.

The Albanian representative emphasized that the imperialist and revisionist plans of aggression will never intimidate the powerful socialist China. China has achieved astonishing successes in production, science, technology, and national defense. China has forever broken the nuclear monopoly of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, which has been warmly congratulated by countries and peoples who love freedom, who regard it as a major factor for peace and international security.

Budo warmly praised the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally is not only a great victory for China but also for all revolutionary forces and all progressive humanity in the world. He said that the slander and defamation of imperialists and revisionists against the People's Republic of China, both inside and outside the United Nations, cannot harm China in the slightest. China's authority and prestige in the international arena are higher than ever before. The great Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are an invincible force, a bastion of socialism and freedom that cannot be shaken. All the anti-China plots of the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists will inevitably meet with shameful failure.

Budo reiterated that the Albanian government firmly supports the restoration of the People's Republic of China's lawful rights in the United Nations. He emphasized that no one can doubt that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole lawful representative of the great Chinese people, and only it has the right to enjoy China's lawful rights in this organization. He pointed out that excluding the representative of 700 million Chinese people from the United Nations is a blatant and shameless violation of the United Nations Charter.

Budo then expounded on the fact that the Albanian People's Republic has consistently pursued a correct, consistent, and principled revolutionary foreign policy. He solemnly warned imperialists, revisionists, and their lackeys that no force of aggression can intimidate the heroic Albanian people. The Albanian people, with their long history of struggle, tempered by revolutionary struggle and led by a heroic party, have always relied on their own strength to defend their homeland with unshakable confidence. Albania's borders are inviolable, and whether it is the NATO aggression bloc or the Warsaw Pact aggression bloc, if they dare to invade Albania, they will not return alive.

Budo also emphasized that Albania is not isolated; Albania has many friends, the peoples of the whole world, and the great and invincible loyal friend—the great People's Republic of China. In his speech, he quoted the telegram from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou to Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mehmet Shehu on September 17th of this year. He said that the telegram from the leaders of the great Chinese people is a powerful and serious warning to the imperialists, revisionists, and their lackeys, that if they dare to touch Albania, if they attack Albania, they will inevitably meet with death. Budo also quoted Comrade Hoxha's speech on September 30th, pointing out that Comrade Hoxha's speech is a loud warning to the enemy and an internationalist duty to friendly and freedom-loving countries and peoples.

    阿尔巴尼亚代表在联合国义正词严发表演讲
    痛斥美苏狼狈为奸妄图瓜分世界
    苏修叛徒集团为了报答美帝默许它侵捷，正使用种种花招为美帝“和谈”骗局效劳，迫使越南人民投降；在中东，美苏加紧勾结企图把所谓“政治解决”强加于阿拉伯各国人民；美苏这两个帝国主义国家不但在世界上划分势力范围，而且在战略上和策略上互相配合，反对各国人民革命斗争
    新华社十八日讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国驻联合国代表团团长哈里姆·布多十一日在联合国大会全体会议上发言，深刻揭露和强烈谴责了世界人民的公敌美帝和苏修在联合国内外加紧勾结，狼狈为奸，反对各国人民的革命斗争，妄图重新瓜分世界的罪恶阴谋。
    布多指出，美国和苏修这两个帝国主义国家，不但在世界上划分势力范围，而且在战略上和策略上互相配合。他指出，当美国—以色列对阿拉伯国家发起武装进攻时，苏联则站在一旁不过问。在南美大陆上，苏修及其在当地的走狗鼓吹同当权的集团“共处”，而美帝则对到处蓬勃兴起的革命进行武装镇压。在越南，苏修鼓吹可耻的投降，美国人则夜以继日地进行轰炸并扩大战争。他指出，苏修侵略捷克斯洛伐克，美帝对此采取了照顾的态度。这最清楚地暴露了这两个大国的勾结，暴露了它们的侵略计划，其目的就是划分势力范围和主宰世界。这表明，这场侵略是它们全球战略计划的一个环节。
    布多强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团对捷克斯洛伐克人民犯下的侵略罪行。他说，这一侵略，暴露了苏修领导集团投机、冒险的叛徒的真面目。世界各国人民强烈谴责这种骇人听闻的野蛮侵略，这场侵略践踏了各国之间关系的基本准则，并对欧洲和世界的自由与和平造成了危险局势。
    布多接着说，苏修对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，充分证明，华沙条约已成为一个由苏修集团操纵的进行奴役和侵略战争的条约。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出华沙条约，在国内和国际上都具有重大意义，是对赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的大国沙文主义政策和侵略政策的一次粉碎性的打击。
    布多在揭露苏修在越南问题上为美帝效劳的无耻行径时指出，美帝侵略越南已经完全陷入绝境，不能自拔。约翰逊政府现在正竭力用“和谈”的圈套来摆脱它在越南的困境。苏修为了报答美帝对他们侵略捷克斯洛伐克的默许，正在作出种种努力，使用种种花招，企图迫使越南人民向侵略者投降。布多强调指出，很明显，美帝国主义者是决不会放弃他们对越南的侵略阴谋的。事实证明，所谓对越南北方的有限度的轰炸，只不过是一场骗局。他说，毫无疑问，对美苏的恶毒阴谋诡计的任何放松警惕，都只能助长侵略。越南人民只有通过武装斗争，才能战胜美国侵略者。
    在谈到中东局势时，布多说，从去年六月美帝—以色列侵略阿拉伯国家以来，阿拉伯的领土仍然处于以色列侵略者占领之下，同时，以色列还不断对阿拉伯国家进行侵略和挑衅。各大洲爱好和平的人民和国家，对造成这种局势的罪魁祸首——美国和苏联表示万分愤怒。布多指出，尽管这样，美苏企图把一项所谓的“政治解决”强加于阿拉伯各国人民，其目的是践踏阿拉伯各国人民的最高利益、他们的独立和领土完整，怂恿以色列侵略者推行他们的扩张政策。
    布多大力揭露了美苏结成反华军事同盟的罪恶阴谋。他指出，由于中华人民共和国是为反对帝国主义侵略、压迫和暴政而斗争的各国人民的始终如一和不可动摇的保卫者，是美帝苏修实现它们的反革命称霸世界计划的最强大的不可逾越的障碍。因此，美帝苏修在加紧镇压亚洲各国人民民族解放运动的同时，加强了对中国的挑衅活动，并建立反华战略包围圈，准备对中国采取侵略行动。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表强调指出，帝国主义和修正主义的侵略计划绝对吓不倒强大的社会主义的中国。中国在生产、科学、技术和国防等一切方面都获得了惊人的成就。中国已永远打破了美帝苏修的核垄断，这受到了热爱自由的国家和人民的热烈祝贺，他们认为这是和平和国际安全的一个重大因素。
    布多热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利。他说，毛泽东主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，不仅对中国，而且对全世界一切革命力量，全体进步人类也是一个具有巨大历史意义的胜利。他说，帝国主义者和修正主义者在联合国内外对中华人民共和国进行的造谣诬蔑，损害不了中国的一根毫毛，中国在国际上的权威和威信比以往任何时候都更高了。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的伟大的七亿中国人民是不可战胜的巨大力量，他们是各国人民的社会主义和自由的坚不可摧的堡垒。美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的一切反华阴谋计划，都必将遭到可耻的失败。
    布多重申，阿尔巴尼亚政府坚决支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。他强调指出，谁都不能怀疑中华人民共和国政府是伟大的中国人民的唯一合法代表，而只有它有权享有中国在这个组织中的合法权利。他指出，把七亿中国人民的代表排除在联合国之外，这是对联合国宪章最悍然无耻的违犯。
    布多接着阐述了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国一直奉行着正确的、一贯的和有原则的革命的对外政策。他严正警告帝国主义、修正主义及其奴仆，世界上没有任何侵略力量能够吓倒英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民。具有悠久的战斗传统的、经过革命斗争锻炼的和由英雄的党领导的阿尔巴尼亚人民，一直怀着不可动摇的信心依靠自己的力量保卫自己的祖国。阿尔巴尼亚的边界是不可侵犯的，不论北大西洋公约组织侵略集团，还是华沙条约侵略集团，它们一旦侵略阿尔巴尼亚，都将不能活着回去。
    布多还强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚不是孤立的，阿尔巴尼亚有许多朋友，有全世界的人民，有伟大的和无敌的忠实朋友——伟大的中华人民共和国。他在讲话中引用了毛主席、林副主席和周总理今年九月十七日给恩维尔·霍查同志和穆罕默德·谢胡同志的电报。他说，伟大的中国人民的领导人的电报是对帝国主义者、修正主义者及其走狗的有力的和严重的警告，如果他们胆敢碰一下阿尔巴尼亚，如果他们进攻阿尔巴尼亚，他们必然要遭到死亡。布多也引用了霍查同志今年九月三十日的讲话，指出，霍查同志的讲话是对敌人的响亮警告，是对友好和热爱自由的各个国家和各国人民的国际主义的义务。
