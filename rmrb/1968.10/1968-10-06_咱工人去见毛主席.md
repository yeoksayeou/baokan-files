We workers, with the sacred book in our hands, are filled with great emotion, heading to Beijing to attend the celebration. The drums beat loudly, and our comrades come to see us off. Along the way, the drums never stop, and words of advice are given:

The waves of the Huangpu River surge, and the heat rises,
The workers' affection is deep and wide;
The steel flowers bloom fiercely, red and bright,
The workers' aspirations stretch across the sky;
We greet the rising sun in the morning and the North Star at night,
The workers think of Beijing every day.

Beijing has our dearest person,
Our dear one is the great leader Chairman Mao!
Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao,
The workers think of you day and night!
Today, we are sent as representatives to the capital,
To present our hearts to you, Chairman Mao!
Seeing the red sun in our hearts,
We shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" for us...

Chairman Mao invites us workers to attend the celebration,
We must bring our latest achievements to see Chairman Mao!

The city of Beijing is filled with red clouds,
The workers' joy is written on their faces.
We hold up the portrait of Chairman Mao,
The red sun rises in our hearts.
We wave the sacred book and shout "Long live!"
We long to see Chairman Mao immediately!
Brave and proud,
The ranks of the working class are vast.
The sunflowers bloom in clusters,
The representatives of the working class gather.
We stride into the city of Beijing,
Our hearts are boiling with excitement.
By the Golden Water Bridge, songs rise,
The loudest praises we sing out loud.
The red flags fly on Tiananmen Gate,
We step closer to Chairman Mao.
Standing on the gate, looking at the world,
The mountains and rivers of the motherland are like a painting.
The sun, moon, and stars all cheer,
Praising the working class ruling the new world!
So many memories surge in our hearts,
The red flag of struggle waves over the long journey.
Chairman Mao stands up for the workers,
The "January Revolution" sweeps like a storm.
We firmly walk the path opened by Chairman Mao,
Resolutely criticize and denounce China's Khrushchev.
Chairman Mao inspects the Cultural Revolution,
The latest instructions illuminate the workers' hearts.
Heart after heart turns into flames,
The working class steers the ship to change the world!
Mountains and rivers echo with victory songs,
The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is raised across the country...
We laugh in our hearts,
And we have prepared our report.
Waiting for the national day salute to sound,
We workers will see the red sun!

"East is red, the sun rises..."
Voices from all over the country echo.
A red sun rises from the sea,
Chairman Mao strides into the crowd of workers.
We clap our hands until they are numb,
We can't express all the heartfelt words.
Thousands of voices sing, ten thousand voices shout,
"Long live Chairman Mao!" The mountains and rivers shake.
In the world, we are the happiest,
Chairman Mao shakes hands with us workers.
Tears, please stop flowing,
We want to look at the great teacher enough;
Heart, please beat slowly,
We want to report to the great leader;
Applause, please stop for a moment,
We want to hear the great commander issue orders;
Comrades, please step aside,
We want to see the great helmsman point the way.
Our hearts are too excited,
Smiling faces are exceptionally red.
Chairman Mao, you are so healthy,
We sing blessings for you thousands and tens of thousands of times;
Chairman Mao, you stride forward,
We follow your strategic deployment without turning back;
Chairman Mao, your thoughts shine,
You teach us: "Seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform"!

On Tiananmen, the order is issued:
"The working class must lead everything."
We workers declare our resolve in front of Chairman Mao—
Bravely take on heavy responsibilities and move forward!
The school gates must be opened for workers,
Workers must teach in the classrooms!
We will manage all fields of the superstructure,
Let the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought be raised everywhere!
We cannot express our resolve and deep affection,
We sincerely wish Chairman Mao longevity!
We attend the national day celebration and are inspected,
Our red hearts for Chairman Mao will never change!
Chairman Mao leads the way, and we stride forward,
Following Chairman Mao, we will fight until the red flag is raised around the world!

    咱工人去见毛主席
    一
    手捧宝书怀豪情，
    咱工人观礼上北京。
    敲起锣鼓冬冬响，
    同志们为咱来送行。
    一路上锣鼓不断音，
    一句句话儿细叮咛：
    浦江滔滔啊热浪翻，
    工人们的情意深又宽；
    钢花怒放啊红彤彤，
    工人们的壮志贯长虹；
    朝迎红日夜望北斗星，
    工人们天天想北京。
    北京啊有咱最亲的人，
    亲人就是伟大领袖毛主席！
    毛主席啊毛主席，
    工人们日夜都想见见您！
    今朝选派代表上首都，
    敬献咱们工人一片心。
    见到咱们心中的红太阳，
    为咱们多喊几声“万岁毛主席！”……
    毛主席请咱工人去观礼，
    咱们要带最新成绩去见毛主席！
    二
    北京城里霞满天，
    咱工人喜悦挂眉尖。
    毛主席画像擎手上，
    咱心头升起红太阳。
    咱挥动宝书呼万岁，
    多想马上见到毛主席！
    雄赳赳啊气昂昂，
    工人阶级队伍多浩荡。
    向阳花开枝连枝，
    工人阶级代表大会师。
    大步跨进北京城，
    咱心潮滚滚在沸腾。
    金水桥畔歌声扬，
    最响亮的颂歌咱放声唱。
    天安门城楼上飘红旗，
    咱步步接近毛主席。
    登上城楼望天下，
    祖国山河美如画。
    日月星辰啊齐喝采，
    欢呼工人阶级主宰新世界！
    多少往事啊心底涌，
    万里征途战旗红。
    毛主席为工人来撑腰，
    “一月革命”啊卷狂飙。
    咱走定了毛主席开辟的路，
    坚决批倒批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    毛主席视察文化大革命，
    最新指示照亮了工人的心。
    一颗颗红心啊化火焰，
    工人阶级力挽狂澜换新天！
    山山水水啊凯歌起，
    祖国插遍了毛泽东思想伟大红旗……
    咱在心里尽情地笑，
    把汇报的词儿都想好。
    单等国庆礼炮一声响，
    咱工人就要见到红太阳！
    三
    “东方红，太阳升……”
    五湖四海声连声。
    一轮红日腾海空，
    毛主席健步来到工人中。
    咱一个劲鼓掌手发麻，
    掏不尽啊满腹贴心话。
    千声唱啊万声呼，
    “毛主席万岁！”震山河。
    世界上数咱最幸福，
    毛主席跟咱工人把手握。
    热泪啊请你止住流，
    咱要把伟大导师看个够；
    心儿啊请你慢慢跳，
    咱要向伟大领袖作汇报；
    掌声啊请你停一停，
    咱要听伟大统帅发号令；
    同志们请你让一让，
    咱要看伟大舵手指航向。
    咱工人的心情太激动，
    笑脸向阳分外红。
    毛主席啊，您身体多健康，
    咱祝福的歌儿千遍万遍地唱；
    毛主席啊，您迈步向前走，
    咱紧跟您的战略部署不回头；
    毛主席啊，您的思想放光采，
    教导咱：“认真搞好斗、批、改”！
    天安门上发号令：
    “工人阶级必须领导一切”。
    咱工人在毛主席面前表决心——
    勇挑重担向前进！
    学校大门要为工人开，
    学校上课要由工人上讲台！
    上层建筑各个领域咱来管，
    让毛泽东思想红旗全插遍！
    咱表不尽决心啊情意长，
    衷心祝福毛主席万寿无疆！
    咱国庆观礼受检阅，
    忠于毛主席的红心永不变！
    毛主席领路啊咱大步走，
    紧跟毛主席战斗到红旗展全球！
