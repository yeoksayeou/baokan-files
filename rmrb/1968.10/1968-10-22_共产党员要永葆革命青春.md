Within our Party, in the matter of Party building, there has always been a fierce struggle between two classes and two lines. Whether Communist Party members are to be vigorous revolutionary fighters or become "tame tools" of revisionism is a crucial aspect of this struggle.

The great poisonous snake, Chinese Khrushchev, has used the high prestige of the Communist Party of China and the sincere love of the Party held by the broad masses of Party members and revolutionaries to concoct the reactionary "tame tools" theory. This is a treacherous trick, a poisoned sweet!

The notorious "tame tools" theory is the concretization and personification of Chinese Khrushchev's black "self-cultivation." Once this theory emerged, his agents in various places seized it as a treasure and propagated it widely, causing extremely bad effects among some Party members and the masses.

The "tame tools" theory denies the necessity of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, obliterates the struggle between the two lines within the Party, and abolishes the dictatorship of the proletariat, thereby giving the green light to the restoration of capitalism.

The "tame tools" theory is a shield for the protection of the bourgeois reactionaries who have infiltrated the Party and a big stick for suppressing the broad masses of Party members and revolutionaries.

The "tame tools" theory is a tight rein to strangle the revolutionary spirit of Communist Party members. It attempts to erode the revolutionary will of Communist Party members, turning them into lifeless, timid political mediocrities.

The "tame tools" theory is a corrosive agent aimed at making Communist Party members degenerate and change their nature. Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places use fame, wealth, and position as bait to lure those with weak willpower. Those who bow their heads and follow are rewarded with both fame and wealth; those who show the slightest resistance and struggle are struck down and retaliated against.

In short, Chinese Khrushchev's "tame tools" theory is to prepare "tame tools" for his restoration of capitalism.

However, Chinese Khrushchev's wishful thinking will never succeed! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has thoroughly smashed Chinese Khrushchev's dream of restoring capitalism and has swept this great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur into the dustbin of history!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Harmful revolutionary leadership should not be accepted unconditionally but should be resolutely resisted." Regarding Chinese Khrushchev and all the capitalist-roaders within the Party, big and small, we must resist them, struggle against them, and overthrow them!

We must smash the "tame tools" theory, tear off its deceptive mask, and expose its reactionary essence!

However, we must unconditionally carry out all the instructions of Chairman Mao and all the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must carry them out letter by letter and item by item. Those we understand, we must carry out; those we do not yet understand, we must also carry out, and deepen our understanding in the process of carrying them out. Is this contradictory? Not at all. Because Chairman Mao's instructions are revolutionary truths, and the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters are revolutionary truths. Following Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and acting according to the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters is to follow revolutionary truths, and it is to do a good job in the revolution and to be invincible.

The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China is the revolutionary party of Marxism-Leninism personally founded and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. To be a member of the Communist Party of China is a great honor and happiness, and at the same time, the revolutionary responsibility is also very heavy. Every Party member must always be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, always be full of vigor and vitality, and always maintain revolutionary youthfulness!

    共产党员要永葆革命青春

    在我们党内，在党的建设问题上，一直存在着两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争。共产党员是做朝气蓬勃的革命战士，还是做修正主义的“驯服工具”，就是这个斗争的一个重要方面。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这条大毒蛇，利用中国共产党的崇高威信，利用广大党员和革命群众热爱党的真挚感情，炮制出反动的“驯服工具论”。这是阴险的花招，带糖的砒霜！
    臭名昭著的“驯服工具论”，是中国赫鲁晓夫黑《修养》的具体化和形象化。“驯服工具论”一出笼，他在各地的代理人，如获至宝，大加宣扬，在一部分党员和群众中，造成极恶劣的影响。
    “驯服工具论”，否定无产阶级专政条件下必须继续革命，抹煞党内两条路线斗争，取消无产阶级专政，为资本主义复辟大开绿灯。
    “驯服工具论”，是保护混入党内的资产阶级反动派的护身符，是镇压广大党员和革命群众的大棒。
    “驯服工具论”，是扼杀共产党员革命精神的紧箍咒。它妄图磨灭共产党员的革命意志，使共产党员变成死气沉沉、畏缩不前的政治庸人。
    “驯服工具论”，是妄图使共产党员蜕化变质的腐蚀剂。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人，用名利地位作钓饵，引诱那些意志不坚定的人上钩。对他们俯首帖耳的，就可以名利兼收；对他们稍有抵制和斗争的，就要遭到打击和报复。
    总之，中国赫鲁晓夫的“驯服工具论”，就是为他复辟资本主义准备“驯服工具”。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫的如意算盘是绝对不会得逞的！无产阶级文化大革命已经彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦，并把这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼扫进了历史的垃圾堆！
    毛主席教导我们：“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。”对于中国赫鲁晓夫，对于大大小小的党内走资派，我们就是要抵制，要斗争，要把他们打倒！
    我们一定要砸烂“驯服工具论”，撕下它的迷人画皮，戳穿它的反动实质！
    然而，我们对毛主席的一切指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的各项战斗号令，则必须字字执行，条条照办，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行过程中加深理解。这是不是有矛盾？一点也不矛盾。因为，毛主席的指示就是革命真理，无产阶级司令部的战斗号令就是革命真理。听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，照无产阶级司令部的战斗号令办事，就是服从革命真理，就能搞好革命，就能无往而不胜。
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导的马克思列宁主义的革命党。做一个中国共产党的党员，是十分光荣、幸福的，同时革命的责任也是非常重大的。每一个党员，都要永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，永远朝气蓬勃，永葆革命青春！
