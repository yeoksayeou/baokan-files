The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) sent a congratulatory letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on September 14, celebrating the establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province) of China. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

When we heard the great news that the Revolutionary Committees of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Tibet Autonomous Region have been established, the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) enthusiastically hailed the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong.

The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong has triumphed throughout China. The bourgeois line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his cohorts, who infiltrated the Party to seize key positions and attempt to place China under the rule of revisionism, has suffered a thorough defeat.

The red flags of the Revolutionary Committees are flying high across China, marking another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought—the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism of our time.

At a time when imperialism, led by U.S. imperialism, is suffering increasingly heavy defeats in the face of attacks by revolutionary peoples, and when modern revisionism, centered around the Soviet leadership, is being torn apart by increasingly serious crises, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a tremendous inspiration and fundamental support for the peoples and revolutionaries of all countries who are fighting against imperialism, reactionaries, and revisionism.

Marxist-Leninist parties around the world are drawing new strength from this victory to creatively apply Mao Zedong Thought to their own specific conditions, to expand their ranks, and to lead the masses in revolutionary struggle.

The Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) and all its organizations and members have the duty to propagate among the masses the profound significance of the new great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Long live the Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party led by Chairman Mao Zedong!

Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the fighting unity between the Communist Party of China and the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist)!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist)
Central Committee

    意共（马列）中央给中共中央贺信祝贺我全国山河一片红
    中国文化大革命胜利大大鼓舞各国人民
    新华社二十六日讯　意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会九月十四日给中国共产党中央委员会一封贺信，祝贺我国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）革命委员会全部成立。贺信全文如下：中国共产党中央委员会：
    当听到新疆维吾尔自治区和西藏自治区成立革命委员会的重大消息的时候，意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）热烈欢呼毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的全面胜利。
    以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线在全中国取得了胜利。钻进党内窃取要职、企图把中国置于修正主义统治之下的中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的资产阶级路线遭到了彻底的失败。
    革命委员会的红旗在全中国迎风飘扬，这是毛泽东思想——当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义——的又一伟大胜利。
    正当以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义到处遭到革命人民的进攻、遭到越来越沉重的失败时，正当以苏联统治集团为中心的现代修正主义为越来越严重的危机所瓦解的时候，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利对正在反对帝国主义、反动派和修正主义的各国人民和革命者，是一个巨大的鼓舞和根本的支持。
    全世界的马克思列宁主义政党正从这个胜利中，汲取新的力量，以便把毛泽东思想创造性地运用到本国的具体实际中去，壮大他们的队伍，率领群众开展革命斗争。
    意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）以及它所有的组织和党员有义务在群众中宣传无产阶级文化大革命新的伟大胜利的深远意义。
    中国人民和他们的以毛泽东主席为领导的光荣的共产党万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利万岁！
    中国共产党和意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）之间的战斗团结万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
      意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）
          中央委员会
