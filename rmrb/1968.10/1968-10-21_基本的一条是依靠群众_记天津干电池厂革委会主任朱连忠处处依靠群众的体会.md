At Tianjin Dry Battery Factory, when workers mention the Revolutionary Committee Chairman and former factory party branch secretary Zhu Lianzhong, they all say in unison: "Our old Zhu, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has undergone a complete transformation and rebirth."

Eliminating the Soil of Detachment from the Masses

Worker comrades led me to the cadmium-nickel workshop to see Zhu Lianzhong's "office," which is a corner of the workshop less than two feet wide, containing only a broken wooden box.

Zhu Lianzhong does this for a reason. He said: "Having an office means being distant from the masses. It means the masses have to find you, not you actively approaching the masses. Cadres detaching from the masses is like a tree without roots or water without a source. It will lead to bureaucratism and the recurrence of old diseases."

From the day Zhu Lianzhong was elected as the Revolutionary Committee Chairman, he made a vow: to be a lifelong fighter who resolutely carries out and bravely defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He reflected on his past mistakes of executing the bourgeois reactionary line, feeling even more that detaching from the worker masses, becoming an official, and acting like a lord, was the main cause of his errors. Born into a poor peasant family, he had eaten coarse grains and suffered from hunger and cold, and at the age of fifteen, he entered a textile factory as a child worker, enduring the whip of the foreman. He also deeply felt the care and love of the old workers. However, after becoming a leader, he was poisoned by the revisionist line of managing factories advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, always acting as a leader, not relying on the worker masses but controlling, restricting, and oppressing them; sitting in the office, relying on oral reports to get by, listening to one side and believing it, seriously dampening the enthusiasm of the worker masses.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through the criticism and help of the worker masses, Zhu Lianzhong returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He often warned himself: "Now, one cannot forget the pain after the wound has healed. One must definitely unite with the worker masses."

Thus, on the day the Revolutionary Committee was established, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support team, he convened the Revolutionary Committee. Everyone studied together the brilliant works of "Old Three Articles" and formulated revolutionary measures to closely connect with the masses. One of these measures was that the Revolutionary Committee would not have a dedicated office, and the committee members would go to the workshops to work.

Now, Zhu Lianzhong comes to the factory every morning, places his clothes and hat in the "office," and then goes deep into the workshops to timely understand the demands and opinions of the masses. Sometimes, when he goes out for meetings or attends Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized by higher-level revolutionary committees, he also tries to use lunch or evening breaks to return to the factory and be close to the masses. When asked why he does this, he replied: "Understanding the active thoughts of the masses allows one to combine the actual situation of the factory and truly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. The closer one is to the masses, the deeper one's understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will be."

Humbly Listening to the Masses' Opinions

At the dry battery factory, everyone often talks about the story of Zhu Lianzhong and the old worker Duan Qinglin, who went from being "bitter enemies" to "class brothers."

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, old worker Duan Qinglin had criticized Zhu Lianzhong for not following the mass line in his work, deciding everything himself. For this, Zhu Lianzhong thought he was a "troublemaker" and gave him a harsh criticism. From then on, a rift formed between them. In the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, through the criticism and help of revolutionary masses, Zhu Lianzhong deeply realized that the reason he could not correctly handle the masses' criticisms in the past was that he did not regard the masses as true heroes but saw himself as a "Zhuge Liang." Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and "Old Five Articles," he further realized that believing in the masses or not is the fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. Therefore, he actively sought out old worker Duan Qinglin to reflect on his mistakes and seek advice. Duan Qinglin saw Zhu Lianzhong's sincere attitude and both criticized and encouraged him: "We are like melons on the same vine. It's just that you were poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev, so you suppressed the masses. I don't hate you; I just hate that you turned towards 'revisionism.'"

Duan Qinglin's words made Zhu Lianzhong feel even more that those who stand on the proletarian side and criticize him harshly with Mao Zedong Thought are the ones who truly care for him.

Zhu Lianzhong also deeply felt in practice that the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line must be continuously cleansed, consciously cleansed, and the sprouts of erroneous thoughts must be suppressed with the power of the masses. After Zhu Lianzhong became the Revolutionary Committee Chairman, there was a period when he was less close to the masses. Workers pointed out that the Revolutionary Committee had become bureaucratic again. Zhu Lianzhong opened Chairman Mao's brilliant works of "Old Three Articles," repeatedly studied and checked himself, and thought of Chairman Mao's latest teachings about "The most fundamental point in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses," feeling that he was indeed as the masses criticized: "He had become bureaucratic again."

The next day, he discussed with the Revolutionary Committee members and decided to immediately conduct a rectification campaign, mobilizing the worker masses to give him and the committee members advice. Thus, through the help of the masses, Zhu Lianzhong timely overcame the tendency to detach from the masses, achieving unity with the masses in eating, studying, and laboring, and often struggling with the masses to expose and criticize himself, placing himself under the supervision of the masses. At the same time, he used holidays to visit workers' homes, have heart-to-heart talks, and seek advice. Now, workers say: "Old Zhu used to see us and twist our necks, with no workers under his eyes. Now he is heart-to-heart with us. Such a cadre, we trust the most."

Advancing with the Masses

Zhu Lianzhong believes in the masses, relies on the masses, and at the same time, insists on principles, actively guides, and enthusiastically helps some revolutionary masses to overcome non-proletarian thoughts, making all the workers in the factory follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, under the command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify their thoughts, steps, and actions, forming a fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Once, Zhu Lianzhong and the production team leaders and activists discussed work together and found that some people had developed arrogance, talking more and doing less. This incident made him think deeply. He thought: Why did some advanced individuals not stand firm? Why did some masses progress slowly? One reason was that some leading comrades deviated from Chairman Mao's dialectical view of "one divides into two," seeing advanced individuals as a perfect flower, ignoring their shortcomings; seeing some masses as completely black, with no redeeming features. Thinking of this, he reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "Grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed." Therefore, he decided to use Chairman Mao's dialectical materialist viewpoint to do good political and ideological work for the masses.

His opinion was supported by all the committee members of the Revolutionary Committee. They used Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a platform to conduct in-depth and detailed political and ideological work for the masses. For the production team leaders and activists, they held two half-off-duty Mao Zedong Thought study classes every month, struggling with selfishness and criticizing revisionism, studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and party policies, helping them to develop their strengths, overcome their weaknesses, and advance continuously.

The Revolutionary Committee of the dry battery factory, with such a good "captain" who resolutely acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, therefore, the committee members, whether revolutionary leading cadres or revolutionary mass representatives, all closely connect with the masses, rely on the masses at every step, and fight on the front lines of class struggle and production struggle. The entire factory's revolution and production present a prosperous scene. However, Zhu Lianzhong did not record these achievements in his "merit book." Every time he was praised, he sincerely said: "If it were not for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support team, and the help of the Revolutionary Committee comrades and worker comrades, there would be no Zhu Lianzhong of today."

    基本的一条是依靠群众
    ——记天津干电池厂革委会主任朱连忠处处依靠群众的体会
    在天津市干电池厂，提起革命委员会主任、原工厂党支部书记朱连忠来，工人们都异口同声地说：我们的老朱啊，在无产阶级文化大革命中，来了个大翻个，脱胎换骨啦。
    清除脱离群众的土壤
    工人同志们领我到镉镍车间参观朱连忠的“办公室”，那是车间里一个不足二尺的角落，只有一个破旧的木箱。
    朱连忠这样做，是有原因的。他说：“有了办公室，离群众就远了，就要群众找你，不是你主动接近群众。干部脱离群众，好比树断根，水绝源，要长官气，会旧病复发。”
    朱连忠从他当选为革委会主任的那一天起，就立下誓言：做一辈子坚决执行、勇敢捍卫毛主席革命路线的战士。他回顾了过去执行资产阶级反动路线的错误，越发感到脱离工人群众，做官当老爷，是导致犯错误的主要原因。自己出生在一个贫农家庭里，常年吃糠咽菜，吃不饱穿不暖，十五岁就进纺织厂当童工，受够了工头的鞭打，也深深地领受了老工人对自己的关心和爱护。可是，做了领导工作以后，却受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义办厂路线的毒害，处处以领导自居，对工人群众不是依靠，而是管、卡、压；坐在办公室里，靠听口头汇报过日子，偏听偏信，严重挫伤了工人群众的积极性。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，通过工人群众的批评、帮助，朱连忠重新回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。他经常给自己敲警钟：现在可不能好了疮疤忘了疼，一定要同工人群众打成一片。
    于是，在革委会成立的当天，他在解放军支左部队的帮助下，召开了革委会，大家在一起学习“老三篇”等光辉著作，制订了密切联系群众的革命化措施。其中的一项就是革委会不设专门的办公室，革委会成员分别到车间去办公。
    现在，朱连忠每天早晨来到工厂，把衣帽放在“办公室”后，就深入到车间，及时了解群众的要求和意见。有时，外出开会或参加上级革委会举办的毛泽东思想学习班，他也尽量利用中午或晚上的空隙时间赶回工厂，接近群众。有人问他为什么这样做时，他回答说：掌握群众的活思想，才能结合本厂的实际情况，真正做到全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，靠群众越近，对毛主席革命路线的理解就越深。
    虚心听取群众的意见
    在干电池厂，大家经常谈到朱连忠与老工人单清林由“死对头”成为“阶级兄弟”的故事。
    无产阶级文化大革命前，老工人单清林曾因朱连忠在工作中不走群众路线，个人说了算，给他提过意见。为此，朱连忠认为他是个“刺头”，就狠狠地批评了他一顿。从此，两人之间结下了疙瘩。在轰轰烈烈的文化大革命中，通过革命群众的批评帮助，朱连忠深刻认识到，过去所以不能正确对待群众批评，就是因为自己没有把群众当成真正的英雄，而是把自己当成“诸葛亮”。通过反复学习毛主席一系列最新指示和“老五篇”，他进一步认识到相信不相信群众，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线与资产阶级反动路线的根本区别。于是，他主动找老工人单清林检讨错误，征求意见。单清林看到朱连忠的态度这样诚恳，对他又是批评，又是鼓励：“咱们本是一根藤上的瓜，只是因为你中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，才压制群众，我并不恨你，只是恨你往‘修’字上变了。”单清林的一席话，使朱连忠更加感到那些站在无产阶级的立场上，用毛泽东思想对自己批评得多、批评得狠的工人同志，才是对自己的爱护。
    朱连忠在实践中还深深体会到，对资产阶级反动路线的流毒，要不断地肃清，自觉地肃清，依靠群众的力量把错误思想的苗头打下去。朱连忠担任革委会主任后，有一阶段，和群众接近较少。工人们对此提出意见，认为革委会又有了官气。朱连忠打开毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，反复学习，反复对照检查，又想到毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的最新教导，觉得自己确实是象群众批评的：“又长了官气”。
    第二天，他同革委会成员研究后，决定马上进行整风，发动工人群众给他和革委会成员提意见。这样，通过群众的帮助，朱连忠及时克服了脱离群众的苗头，做到了与群众同吃、同学习、同劳动，并经常和群众一起亮私、斗私，带头讲自己活学活用毛主席著作的体会，把自己置于群众的监督之下。同时，他还利用假日，到工人家中访问谈心，征求意见。现在，工人们说：“老朱过去见了我们就拧脖子，眼皮底下没工人，现在跟我们心连心，这样的干部，我们最放心。”
    和群众一起不断前进
    朱连忠相信群众，依靠群众，同时也坚持原则，积极引导、热情帮助一些革命群众克服非无产阶级思想，使全厂工人紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，形成一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗集体。
    有一次，朱连忠和生产班、组长等积极分子在一起研究工作，发现其中有的人滋长着骄傲情绪，说得多，做得少。这件事，引起了他的深思。他想：过去有的先进人物为什么树不牢？有的群众为什么进步慢？原因之一是，有关领导人背离了毛主席的一分为二的观点，把先进人物看成是一朵花，完美无缺，对他们的缺点不进行帮助；把有的群众看得一团漆黑，一无是处。想到这里，他又重温了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”于是，他决定运用毛主席的辩证唯物论的观点，做好群众的政治思想工作。
    他的意见得到了革委会全体委员的支持。他们以毛泽东思想学习班为阵地，向群众进行了深入细致的政治思想工作。对生产班、组长和积极分子，每月定期举办两次半脱产的毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，学习毛主席一系列最新指示和党的方针政策，帮助他们发扬优点，克服缺点，不断前进。
    干电池厂革委会由于有了这样坚决按毛主席指示办事的好“班长”，因此，革委会的成员，无论是革命领导干部，还是革命群众代表，都密切联系群众，处处依靠群众，战斗在阶级斗争和生产斗争第一线。全厂革命、生产出现了一片欣欣向荣的景象。但是，朱连忠并没有把这些记在自己的“功劳簿”上。每当他受到表扬，总是出自肺腑地说：“如果没有毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，没有解放军支左部队的帮助，没有革委会同志和工人同志的帮助，就没有我今天的朱连忠。”
