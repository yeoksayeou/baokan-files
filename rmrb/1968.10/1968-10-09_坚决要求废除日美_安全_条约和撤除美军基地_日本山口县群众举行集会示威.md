Workers, youth, students, and women from Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan, numbering about 500, held a rally and demonstration on October 6 in Iwakuni City, where a U.S. military base is located. They resolutely demanded the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty and the withdrawal of U.S. military bases.

In the center of the stage was a banner with Chairman Mao's important inscription, written six years ago to Japanese workers: "As long as you seriously achieve the integration of Marxism-Leninism's universal truths with Japan's revolutionary practice, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt."

Shadow Mountain Haruo, a representative of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left), spoke at the rally. He said that Chairman Mao's inscription to Japanese workers six years ago has the greatest and most profound educational significance for the Japanese revolutionary people. He said that the experience of the Chinese revolution, led by Mao Zedong, proves that as long as Marxism-Leninism is integrated with the specific practices of revolutions in various countries, the masses can unleash boundless power and achieve revolutionary victory. Shadow Mountain emphasized that as long as the Japanese people integrate the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought—with the specific practices of the Japanese revolution, the Japanese people will definitely achieve revolutionary victory.

Shadow Mountain strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionists, who betrayed Marxism-Leninism and willingly acted as henchmen of U.S. imperialism, and the Japanese Communist Party's Royalist revisionist group led by Kyuemon. He pointed out that they have disintegrated and split into factions, falling into a state of complete bankruptcy.

Shadow Mountain pointed out that Japan is currently experiencing a new phase of anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. He said that we must take the working class as the leading class, unite the broad masses of the Japanese people, and launch a sustained and fierce struggle to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty, oppose the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and oppose the Soviet revisionists and the Japanese Communist Party's Royalist revisionist group.

Representatives from the Yamaguchi Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox), the Yamaguchi Prefecture branch of the Japanese Socialist Party, as well as workers, youth, and women, also spoke at the rally. They emphasized the need to fight to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security" Treaty and withdraw U.S. military bases.

The speakers shouted, "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The Japanese revolutionary art troupe, the Gear Stage Theater, performed a new song and dance drama, "The World Enters a New Revolutionary Era with Mao Zedong Thought as the Banner," which greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the attendees. After the rally, the people held up portraits of Chairman Mao and banners with various slogans, singing songs of Mao's quotations and revolutionary songs, and held an anti-U.S. demonstration march near the U.S. Iwakuni base and in the streets of Iwakuni City. Despite the threats and suppression by the large number of armed police and plainclothes agents sent by the Sato government, the puppets of U.S. imperialism, they exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries to the citizens of Iwakuni. The demonstration march received strong support from the citizens of Iwakuni.

Thousands of Japanese young workers and students held a rally and demonstration march in Tachikawa City near Tokyo to oppose U.S. military bases.

    坚决要求废除日美“安全”条约和撤除美军基地
    日本山口县群众举行集会示威
    新华社七日讯　东京消息：日本山口县的工人、青年、学生和妇女约五百人六日在设有美军基地的岩国市举行集会和示威游行，坚决要求废除日美“安全”条约和撤除美军基地。
    会场正面中央悬挂着毛主席六年前书赠日本工人朋友们的重要题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”
    日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）代表影山春雄在会上讲了话。他说，毛主席六年前书赠日本工人朋友们的题词，对日本革命人民具有最重大、最深远的教育意义。他说，毛主席领导的中国革命胜利的经验证明，只要把马克思列宁主义与各国革命的具体实践相结合，人民群众就能发挥无穷的力量，他们就能够取得革命的胜利。影山强调说，只要日本人民把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，把当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本人民就一定能够获得革命的胜利。
    影山强烈谴责背叛马克思列宁主义、甘心充当美帝国主义帮凶的苏联现代修正主义和日共宫本修正主义集团，指出它们已经分崩离析、四分五裂，陷入了总破产的境地。
    影山指出，日本目前正在出现反美爱国斗争的新局面。他说，我们必须以工人阶级为领导阶级，团结广大日本人民，为粉碎日美“安全”条约，为反对美日反动派，反对苏修和日共宫本修正主义集团而展开持久的、猛烈的斗争。
    日中友好协会（正统）山口县总部、日本社会党山口县代表以及工人、青年和妇女代表也在会上讲了话。他们强调必须为粉碎日美“安全”条约和撤除美国军事基地而奋斗。
    讲话人高呼：“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    日本革命文艺团体齿轮座剧团的毛泽东思想宣传队在集会上演出了新编歌舞剧《世界进入了以毛泽东思想为旗帜的革命新时代》，大大地鼓舞了到会群众的斗志。集会结束后，人们高举毛主席画像，还举着写有各种斗争口号的标语牌，高唱毛主席语录歌和革命歌曲，在美军岩国基地附近和岩国市内举行了反美示威游行。他们不顾美帝走狗佐藤政府出动的大批武装警察和便衣特务的威胁和镇压，向岩国市民揭露了美帝和日本反动派的罪行。示威游行得到了岩国市民的热烈支持。
