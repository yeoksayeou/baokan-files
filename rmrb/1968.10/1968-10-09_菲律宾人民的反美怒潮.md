Recently, the broad masses of workers, students, and other strata of people in the Philippines have launched large-scale anti-American demonstrations. The demonstrators blocked the U.S. Clark Air Base, demanding the "arrest" of the commander of the U.S. Clark Base. The roar of "Yankees, go home!" echoed across the Philippines, shaking the land.

The anti-American demonstrations that erupted on the Philippine islands are a strong resistance by the Philippine people against seventy years of American oppression and exploitation. It is a fierce protest against the bloody crimes of American neocolonialism!

The U.S. imperialists have always boasted about how they helped the Philippines achieve "independence" and have claimed that the Philippines is a "democratic showcase." All of this is deceitful. After World War II, the U.S. imperialists only acknowledged the Philippines' "independence" in name, while in reality, they placed the Philippines under the slavery of American neocolonialism. For a long time, the U.S. imperialists have brutally slaughtered and exploited the Philippine people, suppressing the national liberation movement in the Philippines. The U.S. imperialists still maintain a large number of invading troops in the Philippines and have established many military bases, trampling and desecrating this island nation. This so-called "democratic showcase" is actually a typical "showcase" of American neocolonialism.

The Philippine people have a tradition of bravely resisting imperialism and colonialism. They have bravely resisted Spanish colonialists, fought against the Japanese imperialist occupying forces, and have waged a long and arduous struggle against U.S. imperialism to achieve national liberation. Today, a Philippine people's armed force is still persistently fighting a tenacious liberation struggle. The Philippine people's struggle for liberation, despite its twists and turns, is an unstoppable revolutionary flame. The recent large-scale anti-American demonstrations in the Philippines once again show that the broad masses of the Philippine people are determined to drive U.S. imperialism out of their sacred land and are determined to achieve true independence and national liberation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The jackals of imperialism should remember that the era when they could arbitrarily manipulate the fate of humanity and arbitrarily carve up the countries of Asia and Africa has passed and will not return." The Philippines belongs to the Philippine people. The Philippine people's anti-American fury is unstoppable. They will definitely unite further and carry on the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end, until they achieve final victory.

### 菲律宾人民的反美怒潮

    菲律宾人民的反美怒潮
    最近，菲律宾的广大工人、学生和其他各阶层人民，连续掀起了大规模的反美示威。示威群众封锁美国克拉克空军基地，要求“通缉”美军克拉克基地的司令。“美国佬滚回去！”的怒吼声，响彻菲律宾的上空，震撼了菲律宾的大地。
    菲律宾群岛上爆发的这次反美示威，是菲律宾人民对七十年来美帝的奴役和压迫的一种强烈的反抗，是他们对于血淋淋的美国新殖民主义的罪恶统治的一次愤怒的抗议！
    美帝国主义一向吹嘘它如何帮助菲律宾“独立”，宣扬菲律宾是什么“民主橱窗”。这统统都是骗人的玩艺儿。第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义只是在名义上承认菲律宾的“独立”，而事实上却把菲律宾置于美国新殖民主义的奴役之下。长期以来，美帝国主义残暴地屠杀和压榨菲律宾人民，镇压菲律宾的民族解放运动。美帝国主义迄今仍然在菲律宾驻扎着大量的侵略军队，设立着许多军事基地，践踏和蹂躏着这个群岛之国。这个所谓“民主橱窗”，实际上正是一个典型的美国新殖民主义“橱窗”。
    菲律宾人民有着英勇反抗帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争传统。他们曾经英勇地反抗过西班牙殖民主义者，抗击过日本帝国主义的占领军，并且为反对美帝国主义、争取民族的解放，进行了长期艰巨的斗争。今天，一支菲律宾人民的武装力量仍在坚持着不屈不挠的解放斗争。菲律宾人民的解放斗争，尽管遭到过曲折和反复，但是，菲律宾人民反帝革命斗争的火焰是扑灭不了的，革命总是要向前发展的。最近菲律宾连续爆发的大规模反美示威，再一次表明了广大的菲律宾人民是坚决要把美帝国主义赶出自己神圣的国土，坚决要求真正的独立和民族解放的。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运、任意宰割亚非国家的时代，已经一去不复返了。”菲律宾是属于菲律宾人民的。菲律宾人民的反美怒潮是不可阻挡的。他们一定会进一步团结起来，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底，直到取得最后的胜利。
