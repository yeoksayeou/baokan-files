The Capital Workers' Propaganda Team at Tsinghua University, guided by the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "the working class must also raise its political consciousness through struggle," has striven to arm itself with Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen its revolutionary construction, and ensure the successful completion of all tasks.

The propaganda team, composed mainly of industrial workers and including members of the People's Liberation Army, comes from 59 factories and enterprises. They have united closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, fighting bravely to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, forming a revolutionary force that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, revolutionary, and combat-ready.

Upon entering Tsinghua University, the propaganda team emphasized proletarian politics within its ranks, vigorously promoting the study of Mao Zedong Thought, learning and applying it in the struggle. Their daily practice of reading Chairman Mao's works is unwavering. They frequently use Mao Zedong Thought to measure their own thoughts and work. The propaganda team repeatedly organized workers to study Chairman Mao's instructions on "the working class must lead everything," recognizing their great historical mission and strengthening their resolve to lead the proletarian educational revolution. Acts of bravery, overcoming hardships, and completing tasks are abundant within the workers' propaganda team. Some veteran workers are deeply concerned about the proletarian educational revolution day and night; some workers, even when sick, persist in their work; on rest days, some workers do not return home but stay in the school to help revolutionary teachers and staff organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The propaganda team frequently holds meetings to share experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, conducts small rectification campaigns, and uses the arrows of Mao Zedong Thought to target various active thoughts, continuously raising the political consciousness of each team member. A veteran worker from the Beijing Chemical Industry Factory initially felt that he was just an ordinary worker who had never done leadership work and was afraid of saying the wrong thing and being criticized. He studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "the working class is the leading class" repeatedly, replacing "fear" with "dare." He actively propagates Mao Zedong Thought, helps a research institute organize a Mao Zedong Thought study class, and achieves remarkable results. Workers from the Beijing New China Printing Factory, stationed at Tsinghua University, addressed the issue of some workers lacking long-term planning through a small rectification campaign focused on recalling and comparing the past. They recalled the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, further raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Some workers who originally lacked long-term planning said: "The great leader Chairman Mao has entrusted us, the working class, with the heavy responsibility of leading the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end, and let the working class occupy the educational front forever!"

The propaganda team consistently takes the People's Liberation Army as an example, adheres to the Four Firsts, promotes the Three-Eight Style, advocates the Three Great Democracies, and observes the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. The entire propaganda team has implemented military organization, and the activities of the Four Good Teams and Five Good Soldiers are widely carried out.

The propaganda team also promotes its own ideological revolutionization through revolutionary criticism. They have opened over a hundred revolutionary criticism columns, applying the experience of factory workshop-level criticism to the school, frequently criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in various types of study classes. Currently, a wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation is rising at Tsinghua University.

    首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队为革命师生做出榜样
    活学活用毛泽东思想加强自身革命化建设
    据新华社十日讯　首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的亲切教导，努力用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，加强革命化建设，有力地保证了各项工作任务的胜利完成。
    以产业工人为主体的、有解放军参加的首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队，来自五十九个工厂企业。他们紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，为了全面落实毛主席的最新指示而英勇战斗，形成了一支无限忠于毛主席的革命化、战斗化的革命队伍。
    宣传队一进入清华大学，就在自己的队伍中大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓学习毛泽东思想，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。他们天天读毛主席的书的制度，是雷打不动的。他们经常用毛泽东思想衡量自己的思想和工作。宣传队反复组织工人学习毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的指示，认清了自己肩负的伟大历史使命，领导无产阶级教育革命的决心更大。不怕苦、不怕累、战胜困难、完成任务的好人好事，在工人宣传队中层出不穷。有的老工人，为实现无产阶级教育革命日夜操心；有的工人生了病，还是坚持工作；就是到了轮休日，有的工人也不回去，留在学校帮助革命师生员工办毛泽东思想学习班。
    宣传队经常举行活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，开展小整风，用毛泽东思想之矢，射各种活思想之的，不断提高每个宣传队员的政治觉悟。北京化工三厂一位老工人，刚进学校时，觉得自己是个普通工人，没做过领导工作，怕说错了话被人抓辫子。他带着这个问题，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席关于“工人阶级是领导阶级”的指示，把“怕”字换成了“敢”字。他努力宣传毛泽东思想，帮助一个研究室办毛泽东思想学习班，工作很有成绩。北京新华印刷厂进驻清华大学的工人同志，针对他们中少数人缺乏长期打算的活思想，开展了以回忆对比为内容的小整风。大家忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命谬论，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高。有的原来缺乏长期打算的工人说：“伟大领袖毛主席把领导学校搞好斗、批、改的重任交给了我们工人阶级，我们一定遵照毛主席指示，把学校无产阶级教育革命进行到底，让工人阶级世世代代占领教育阵地！”
    宣传队处处以解放军为榜样，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，遵守三大纪律、八项注意。整个宣传队实行了军事编制，普遍开展了四好连队、五好战士活动。
    宣传队还以革命的大批判来促进自身的思想革命化。他们开辟了一百多个革命大批判专栏，把工厂开展班组大批判的经验，运用到学校中，经常在各种类型的学习班里，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。现在，一个斗、批、改的高潮，正在清华大学兴起。
