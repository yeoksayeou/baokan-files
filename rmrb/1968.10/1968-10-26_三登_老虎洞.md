A large number of cadres have been sent down to labor, and this is an excellent opportunity for them to re-learn. In the "May 7th" agricultural and forestry farm organized by the Revolutionary Committee of Huailai County, more than 130 cadres are working. Below are a few small stories of cadres re-learning and transforming their thoughts while working here.

The team planting potatoes is marching towards the "Tiger Cave." People are carrying hoes and carrying seeds, climbing up the winding mountain path. Leading the way is the former deputy secretary of the county committee, Fan Rongru. He is particularly excited and thrilled to be about to reach a place where he once fought against the enemy in bitter cold and snow twenty years ago. As soon as he arrived, he took off his outer clothes, rolled up his pants, and started working with a hoe. He worked for more than three hours straight, sweating all over his face and covered in dust.

During the rest period, everyone held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought at the field. They studied together Chairman Mao's warm instructions: "Cadres should participate in collective production labor to maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism." Then, facing the towering "Tiger Cave," a heated discussion began, the more they discussed, the more enthusiastic they became, and the more they felt that this towering "Tiger Cave" was indeed a good classroom for re-learning. At this moment, Old Fan became even more excited and could not help but stand up and say: Comrades, I have climbed the "Tiger Cave" for the third time today. At the age of eight or nine, I climbed the "Tiger Cave" to chop firewood and herd sheep for the landlord. Twenty years ago, following Chairman Mao to revolutionize, I climbed the "Tiger Cave" in the midst of gunfire and bullets. But after liberation, when I entered the city, my position became higher and higher, and my feelings changed more and more. In twenty years, I have not climbed the "Tiger Cave" again. People have left the "Tiger Cave," and their hearts have left their class brothers who have fought side by side through wind and rain. The great proletarian cultural revolution has given me a great shock, making me deeply realize that a long-unused hoe will rust, and fertile land that is not farmed for a long time will become barren. Cadres who are separated from labor for a long time will become revisionists. I must take the farm as a good place to re-establish revolutionary feelings, re-cultivate labor habits, and temper the will to fight, and reform myself.

Old Fan's words moved everyone greatly. After the rest, everyone threw themselves into the land reclamation battle with doubled efforts.

    三登“老虎洞”
    “广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会”。怀来县革命委员会举办的“五·七”农林场中，有一百三十多名下放干部在劳动着。下面就是在这里劳动的干部重新学习，改造思想的几个小故事。
    种山药的队伍，正向“老虎洞”进军。人们扛着镢头，背着种籽，沿着弯弯曲曲的山路，向上爬着。走在最前头的是原县委副书记范荣儒，他为即将来到二十年前曾经爬冰卧雪与敌人艰苦战斗过的地方而感到格外激动和兴奋。一到地头，他就甩掉外衣，卷起裤脚，抡起板镢干起来了。一口气干了三个多钟头，弄得满脸汗水，满身尘土。
    休息的时候，大伙在地头上办起了毛泽东思想学习班。大家共同学习毛主席的亲切教导：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”接着，面对高高的“老虎洞”，展开了热烈议论，越议越起劲，越议越觉得这高耸入云的“老虎洞”确实是重新学习的好课堂。这时老范更加激动，情不自禁地站起来说道：同志们，我来讲几句。我今天已是三登“老虎洞”了。八九岁时，我给地主打柴放羊登过“老虎洞”。二十年前，跟着毛主席干革命，在枪林弹雨中，我登过“老虎洞”。但是，解放以后开进城，我的职位一天天高了，感情一天天变了，二十年工夫再也没有登过这“老虎洞”。人离开了“老虎洞”，心离开了同自己风里来、雨里去，并肩战斗过的阶级兄弟。轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命给了我很大触动，使我深深体会到：这大板镢长期不用就要长锈，这肥沃的土地长期不种就要荒芜，我们干部长期脱离劳动就会变“修”。我一定要把农场当作革命感情的再建立、劳动习惯的再培养、战斗意志的再锻炼的好地方，好好改造自己。
    老范的一席话使同志们很受感动。休息之后，大家以加倍的劲头，投入了开荒战斗。
