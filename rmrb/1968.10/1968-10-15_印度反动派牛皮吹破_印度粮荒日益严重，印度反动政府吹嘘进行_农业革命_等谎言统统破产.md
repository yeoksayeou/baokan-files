The Indian reactionaries' boasts have been exposed. The food crisis in India is worsening, and the lies spread by the Indian reactionary government about an "agricultural revolution" have all been debunked.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from New Delhi: Broad regions of India have recently suffered severe droughts, exacerbating the food crisis. The Indian reactionary government has once again begged the U.S. imperialists for food aid. This reactionary government had previously boasted about conducting an "agricultural revolution" and achieving self-sufficiency in food within three years. All these boasts have been exposed as lies.

Currently, out of India's sixteen states, ten are experiencing widespread drought, affecting tens of millions of farmers. The most severely affected state is Rajasthan, where the current drought is reportedly the worst in sixty-five years. In Andhra Pradesh, twelve million people have been affected. Some drought-stricken areas have recently experienced floods; for example, four thousand villages in Gujarat were flooded last month, killing hundreds of people, and now they are facing drought. Haryana state also recently experienced floods, and now approximately 1.5 million people are suffering from drought, with 800,000 acres of crops withering.

This situation shows that under the brutal feudal exploitation system and corrupt reactionary rule, Indian agriculture cannot escape the fate of being at the mercy of the weather, experiencing droughts and floods alternately. On the 23rd, Indian Food Minister Jagjivan Ram had to admit at a meeting of state chief ministers that the drought will make the food crisis even more severe.

The Indian reactionary government had boasted about discovering a new strain of wheat that significantly increased grain yields, claiming this to be their "agricultural revolution." This is pure nonsense. It is clear that the only solution to India's food problem is revolution plus production.

    印度反动派牛皮吹破
    印度粮荒日益严重，印度反动政府吹嘘进行“农业革命”等谎言统统破产
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：印度广大地区最近发生严重旱灾，粮荒情况更加恶化。印度反动政府又向美帝伸手乞粮。这个反动政府不久以前还吹嘘它进行了一场“农业革命”，“三年内做到粮食自给”。这些牛皮统统吹破了。
    目前在印度的十六个邦中有十个邦普遍干旱，受灾的农民达几千万人。灾情最重的有拉贾斯坦邦，据说目前的旱灾是六十五年来最严重的一次。安德拉邦有一千二百万人受灾。有一些旱灾地区不久前刚刚遭受过水灾，例如古吉拉特邦的四千个村庄，上月份因水灾淹死了几百人，现在又发生旱灾。哈里亚纳邦也是在不久以前遭受过水灾，现在又有大约一百五十万人遭受旱灾，八十万公亩土地上的庄稼枯萎。
    这种情况说明，在残酷的封建剥削制度下，在腐败的反动统治下，印度农业不可能摆脱“靠天吃饭”、时旱时涝的境况。印度粮食部长贾吉凡·拉姆二十三日在各邦首席部长会议上，不得不承认旱灾将使粮荒日益严重。
    印度反动政府曾经吹嘘说它找到一种什么良种小麦，使粮食产量大大增加，说这就是什么“农业革命”。这纯粹是无稽之谈。十分明显，解决印度的吃饭问题的办法只有一个，那就是革命加生产。
