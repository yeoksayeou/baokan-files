A grinding machine for guide rails, eight meters long and weighing ten tons, which had been discarded as scrap for four years, has been revived and is once again serving socialist production. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a powerful blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

As early as 1965, our grinding machine workers proposed that the grinding efficiency of the surface grinder was low and the labor intensity was high, and suggested trying to manufacture a guide rail grinding machine. The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in our factory and the so-called "technical authorities" of the bourgeoisie organized a group of people to spend seven or eight months working on it. The grinding machine was made, but these people, who were full of thoughts of "bonuses," did not wait for the trial production to be successful. They repeatedly urged to "report good news," wanting to reap a lot of oil. As a result, the "good news" was reported, the fame was gained, and the "innovation bonus" was pocketed, but they abandoned the grinding machine. The grinding machine could not be used and had to be pushed into the scrap yard. Old worker Zhao Ronglin saw this and angrily said to them, "You seek fame and fortune, you don't care about the country, you don't care about the lives of the workers, what's the difference between you and the capitalists!"

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers seized the party, government, finance, culture, and technology powers back into our own hands. The revolutionary committee of the factory, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production," called on everyone to firmly implement the policy proposed by Chairman Mao in the "Anshan Constitution," to carry out a technological revolution and technological innovation. The revolutionary masses proposed that repairing the guide rail grinding machine could solve the "old difficult problem" of the fitters' scraping and grinding. This opinion was strongly supported by the factory revolutionary committee, which specially established an innovation group to remove this "roadblock."

As soon as the innovation group was established, some people started to talk behind their backs. They spread the word: "The repair section has never succeeded in innovation, this time it's probably just a blind man lighting a lamp, wasting candle wax." The revolutionary committee discovered this trend and, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "hold study classes, which is a good way, many problems can be solved in study classes," immediately organized the innovation group to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents for pushing the revisionist line of "production first," "bonus as the guiding principle," and "experts running the factory," and broke away from the fear, lightening their load. The comrades in the innovation group, with their loyal hearts to Chairman Mao, held the precious book and swore to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You old man are backing us up, we will definitely make you proud, and we will definitely fix the guide rail grinding machine."

During the modification process, the worker comrades carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, broke the foreign dogmas and foreign frameworks, and found materials in the scrap pile when there were none; they designed and drew the blueprints themselves when there were no blueprints or materials. Every time they encountered difficulties, the entire workshop gave them full support. The responsible comrades of the revolutionary committee studied Chairman Mao's teachings with them: "Our comrades should see achievements and see the light when facing difficulties, should raise our spirits." They went to sister factories to learn and observe, learned from others' strengths to make up for their own weaknesses, and repeatedly carried out innovations and modifications, overcoming one difficulty after another. Finally, the guide rail grinding machine, which had been discarded as scrap for four years, was revived in the victory song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The guide rail grinding machine, after being repaired, produced a bed surface that fully met the quality requirements, with a work efficiency increased by more than five times, greatly reducing the labor intensity. Teacher Zhao Ronglin was very excited and said, "Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution has given this grinding machine a new life. In a word, it was not done before because we workers did not have the power, and it was done today because we workers have seized the power."

The working class must thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and completely seize the technological power from the hands of the bourgeoisie.

    工人阶级掌权以后
    一台长达八米，重十吨，被当作废品处理扔在一旁达四年之久的导轨磨床，获得了新生，重新为社会主义生产服务了。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是给中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的专家路线一个有力的打击。
    早在一九六五年，我们磨床工人就提出刮研床面工效低，劳动强度大，应当试制一台导轨磨床。中国赫鲁晓夫在我厂的代理人和资产阶级技术“权威”，组织了一些人费了七、八个月的工夫，磨床造出来了。谁知，这帮满脑袋“奖金”的家伙，不等试制成功，就三番五次催着去“报喜”，想大捞油水。结果，“喜”报了，名得了，“革新奖金”捞到了手，对磨床却撒手不管了。磨床不能用，只好推进废品库。老工人赵荣林看在眼里，气愤地对他们说：“你们为名誉，为奖金，不顾国家，不管工人死活，和资本家有什么两样！”
    无产阶级文化大革命中，我们工人阶级把党政财文和技术大权夺回到自己手里。厂革委会遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，号召大家，坚决贯彻毛主席在“鞍钢宪法”中提出的方针，大搞技术革命和技术革新。广大革命职工提出，修复导轨磨床可以解决钳工刮研这个“老大难”的问题。这个意见得到了厂革委会的大力支持，专门成立了革新小组，搬掉这个“拦路虎”。
    革新小组一成立，有的人就在背后说风凉话。散布说：“机修段从来没搞成革新，这回恐怕也是瞎子点灯，白费蜡。”革委会发现这种苗头，遵循毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，立即组织革新小组办起毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习“老三篇”和毛主席一系列最新指示，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“生产第一”、“奖金挂帅”、“专家治厂”的修正主义路线，破除怕字，轻装上阵。革新小组的同志怀着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，手捧宝书向毛主席宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家给我们撑腰，我们一定为您老人家争气，坚决把导轨磨床修好。”
    在改修过程中，工人同志发扬自力更生的精神，大破洋教条洋框框，没有材料，到废品堆去找；没有图纸资料，自己设计自己画。每当他们遇到困难，全车间的同志就给予全力支持。革委会负责同志和他们一起学习毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”他们跑到兄弟厂参观学习，取人之长，补己之短，反复进行革新改造，闯过了一道又一道难关，终于使扔在一旁已四年之久作为废品处理的导轨磨床在无产阶级文化大革命胜利的凯歌声中复生了。用复生的导轨磨床，加工出来的床面完全符合质量要求，工效提高五倍多，大大减轻了劳动强度。赵荣林老师傅非常激动地说：“毛主席领导的文化大革命，使这台磨床也得到了新生。说来说去一句话，过去没搞成就是因为咱工人阶级没有权，今天搞成了，就是因为咱工人阶级掌了权。”
    工人阶级必须彻底砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线，把技术大权从资产阶级手中彻底地夺回来。
