The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought is the wisest
— A Collection of New Products and Techniques from Various Places

According to Xinhua News Agency, "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." Chairman Mao's brilliant statement is an unbreakable truth. The Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is displaying boundless wisdom and creativity, constantly achieving miracles that bourgeois dilettantes and right-wing conservatives never imagined.

Tuning Fork Clock

The revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Clock Factory, with the strong cooperation of sister units, recently produced China's first tuning fork clock, filling a gap in China's clock-making industry.

The tuning fork clock is made using new technologies from modern electronics. In this type of clock, a tuning fork and semiconductor electronic components form a tuning fork oscillator, replacing the escapement and balance spring. Its structure is simple, easy to manufacture, and low-cost, with minimal impact from external vibrations and temperature changes, resulting in a daily error of only about two seconds. It has a wide range of applications and can be used in cars, ships, and airplanes.

Six-Six-One—Medical Adhesive

The revolutionary workers of the Gaizhou Chemical Factory in Liaoning Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have successfully developed the rare international medical adhesive Six-Six-One, contributing to the development of China's medical and health services. Six-Six-One is an organic compound used to glue wounds and surgical incisions during the treatment of external injuries and major and minor surgeries, eliminating the need for sutures and bandages. This adhesive is convenient to use and reduces patient pain. Currently, after clinical trials in over forty hospitals across the country with more than a thousand cases, the results have been excellent.

High-Pressure Prestressed Concrete Water Pipe

Under the great inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class," the workers of the Xi'an Red Flag Cement Products Factory recently successfully developed China's first high-pressure prestressed concrete water pipe, filling a technological gap in China and opening new paths for replacing cast iron pipes with cement pipes.

The high-pressure prestressed concrete water pipe has a longer service life than a cast iron pipe of the same specification, does not rust when buried in the ground, and can save over 80% of steel. Compared to general prestressed concrete water pipes, it has thinner walls, is lighter, does not leak, is more durable, and can save one-third of steel and two-fifths of cement. Additionally, it does not require a pipeline foundation for installation. This water pipe not only has excellent quality but also has a simple manufacturing process, greatly improving production efficiency.

Vapor Phase Rust-Preventing Paper

The revolutionary workers and technical personnel of the Wuhan Paper Mill, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the assistance of relevant research institutions, have displayed a daring spirit of innovation, broken through foreign constraints, and successfully developed vapor phase rust-preventing paper, which is now in production. Vapor phase rust-preventing paper is an essential new type of anti-rust material for many modern industries. The vapor phase rust-preventing paper developed and mass-produced by the Wuhan Paper Mill has reached international standards. Trials by dozens of units across the country have proven that this paper performs better than anti-rust oil, has a longer anti-rust period, and is more convenient to use than anti-rust oil.

New Process for Producing Phosphorus Fertilizer

The workers of the Ziyang County Phosphorus Fertilizer Factory in Sichuan Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with revolutionary technical personnel, have successfully experimented with a new process—the slurry method for producing pure calcium without chemical conversion. This opens a new path for better utilizing low-grade phosphorus ore resources. After a national appraisal meeting, it was determined that the superphosphate produced using this new process has a 1.4% to 2.4% increase in effective phosphorus, a one-level improvement in product grade, a 15% to 20% reduction in sulfuric acid consumption, and a significant reduction in labor, greatly improving working conditions and shortening the production cycle.

Phosphorus fertilizer produced using this new process has been proven effective in rural areas and is welcomed by the broad masses of rural community members.

Universal High-Frequency AC Welding Machine

The workers and revolutionary technical personnel of the AnTu County Electrical Machinery Factory in Jilin Province, with high political enthusiasm, have designed and manufactured a universal high-frequency AC welding machine that reaches international advanced levels. This high-frequency AC welding machine is easy to operate, provides strong welding, is low-cost, has high efficiency, and has a wide range of applications. It can weld various specifications of non-ferrous metals and alloy steel parts less than one millimeter thick, as well as parts with painted surfaces, rust, or that are easily melted at high temperatures.

	Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 7's several ordinary workers, during the Cultural Revolution, actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought. With the cooperation of an old electrician, they successfully created a new type of steel cleaning combined machine in less than half a year. This steel cleaning combined machine, after being in production for over three months, has proven to meet production requirements. This is a photo of workers exchanging ideas on further improving the steel cleaning combined machine.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级最聪明
    ——各地出现的新产品、新工艺集锦
    据新华社讯 “卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。伟大领袖毛主席的这一英明论断是颠扑不破的真理。掌握了毛泽东思想的我国工人阶级，发挥无穷的聪明才智，正在不断地创造为资产阶级庸人和右倾保守主义者所意想不到的奇迹。
    音叉钟
    上海钟厂的无产阶级革命派在兄弟单位的大力协作下，最近制成了我国第一台音叉钟，填补了我国制钟工业的一门空白。
    音叉钟是运用现代电子科学的新技术制成的。在这种钟上，用音叉和半导体电子元件组成的音叉振动子，代替了摆轮和游丝。它的结构简单，制造方便，成本低，受外界震动和温度变化的影响极小，每天误差只有二秒左右。它的使用范围很广，可在汽车、轮船、飞机上使用。
    六六一——医用胶粘剂
    辽宁省盖州化工厂革命工人，在解放军的帮助下，自力更生，试制成功了国际稀有的六六一——医用胶粘剂，为发展我国的医疗卫生事业作出了贡献。六六一——医用胶粘剂，是一种有机化合物，在治疗外伤和作大、小手术时，用它来粘合伤口和手术刀口，可不再用线缝和包扎。这种胶粘剂使用方便，能够减轻病人痛苦。目前，经过各地四十多个医院上千例的临床试用，效果很好。
    高压预应力钢筋混凝土输水管
    在伟大领袖毛主席关于“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级”的最新指示巨大鼓舞下，西安红旗水泥制品厂的工人最近试制成功了我国第一根高压预应力钢筋混凝土输水管，填补了我国的一项技术空白，为我国进一步用水泥管代替铸铁管开辟了新的途径。
    高压预应力钢筋混凝土输水管比同一规格的铸铁管使用期长，埋在土里不生锈，可以节约钢材百分之八十以上；比一般预应力钢筋混凝土输水管的管壁薄，重量轻，不渗水，耐久性长，可以节约钢材三分之一、水泥五分之二，并且不需要做管道基础，就可以进行安装。这种输水管不但质量好，而且工艺过程简单，大大提高了生产效率。
    气相防锈纸
    武汉造纸总厂的革命工人和革命技术人员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在有关科研单位的协助下，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，打破洋框框，试制成功气相防锈纸，并投入了生产。气相防锈纸是现代许多工业部门不可缺少的一种新型的防锈材料。武汉造纸总厂试制成功并成批生产的气相防锈纸的防锈性能，达到了国际水平，全国几十个单位试用证明，这种纸的性能比防锈油好，防锈期比防锈油长，使用起来比防锈油方便。
    生产磷肥的新工艺
    四川省资阳县磷肥厂的工人，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同革命技术人员一道，试验成功了一种新的工艺流程——矿浆法制普钙无化成流程，为更好地利用低品位磷矿资源开辟了一条崭新的道路。经全国性的鉴定会议鉴定，采用这种新的工艺流程生产出来的过磷酸钙，有效磷提高了百分之一点四至二点四，产品等级提高了一级，硫酸消耗降低了百分之十五至二十，而且减少了大量劳动力，大大改善了劳动条件，缩短了生产周期。
    应用这项新工艺生产的磷肥，经过农村实际使用，证明肥效很好，受到广大农村社员欢迎。
    万能高频交流电焊机
    吉林省安图县电机厂工人和革命技术人员以高度的政治热情，自行设计和制造具有国际先进水平的万能高频交流电焊机。这种高频交流电焊机，操作简便，焊接牢固，成本低，效率高，使用范围广，可以焊接一毫米以下的各种规格的有色金属和合金钢焊件，也可以焊接表面涂有漆或生锈以及因高温易溶化等焊件。
