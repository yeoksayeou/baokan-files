An important editorial in the *Red Flag* magazine has conveyed our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on rectifying the Party's organization and strengthening Party building: "A person has arteries and veins, through which the heart circulates blood, and also needs the lungs to breathe, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without removing waste and absorbing fresh blood, the Party will lack vigor." Chairman Mao's latest instructions express the sentiments of our working class. We wholeheartedly support and will definitely carry out his instructions. Chairman Mao's latest instructions not only point out the fundamental direction for the rectification of the Party but also once again indicate the direction for the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries.

I was born into a poor peasant family. From a young age, I followed my parents in fleeing from famine and begging for food, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. It was Chairman Mao who liberated me, a suffering child, from the old society. It was Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts that nurtured my growth. It was he who supported our working class in taking the stage of managing state affairs. Truly, parents' love is nothing compared to Chairman Mao's love; nothing is greater than the Party's kindness. Whenever I think of him, I have endless heartfelt words to say; whenever I see his portrait, I feel full of strength; whenever I study his brilliant thoughts, I can navigate through storms. I, a suffering child, have long yearned to join the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao.

However, Khrushchev in China and his agents in our factory have long promoted a set of revisionist lines for building the Party, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian line for building the Party. They spread reactionary fallacies such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of the tamed tool" among our working class, attempting to turn our proletarian party into a revisionist party and to turn the broad masses of Party members and revolutionary workers into their "tamed tools" for restoring capitalism. In our factory, as in the rest of the country, there has been a sharp struggle between two classes and two lines on the question of what kind of party to build.

When I first applied to join the Party, the capitalist roaders in our factory said that one should just work hard and produce well to join the Party, without mentioning the need to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought. When we responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought and strengthen our worldview transformation, the capitalist roaders in our factory secretly handed us the black book *On the Cultivation of the Self*, saying that studying this would qualify us for Party membership.

The capitalist roaders in our factory also used every means to bring a handful of traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang into the Party, while excluding many vigorous and excellent workers. When we workers could no longer suppress our anger and bravely fought against them, the capitalist roaders said that we did not understand "policy" and were too "rebellious," which would affect our chances of joining the Party. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries saw through the class enemies' plots and rose up to rebel against them, seizing their power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat." Our working class wants to join its vanguard, not to become "officials" or for any personal gain, but to temper our unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao under his loving care and in the radiance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We want to train ourselves to be steadfast warriors who will forever defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and charge into the fray in the struggle against the enemy.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we rebelled against the capitalist roaders to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; we seized power from the capitalist roaders to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure that the socialist iron mountain will never change color.

Although I am not yet a Communist Party member, I firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, and actively participate in the rectification of the Party. I will strive to build our Party into "an advanced organization of the proletariat, capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy, a vigorous vanguard organization." In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's conditions for being a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought more effectively, raise my awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, regularly participate in productive labor, maintain close ties with the masses, and with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," transform my worldview. I will quickly train myself to be a proletarian revolutionary warrior unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao.

    尽快把自己锻炼成一个无限忠于毛主席的革命战士
    甘肃长风机器厂革委会委员、工人　殷志成
    《红旗》杂志的重要社论传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席关于整顿党的组织、加强党的建设的最新指示：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”毛主席的最新指示说出了我们工人阶级的心里话，我们一千个拥护，一万个照办。毛主席的最新指示，不仅给整党工作指出了根本方向，也再一次给我们广大无产阶级革命派指出了前进方向。我出生在一个贫下中农家庭，从小就跟着爹娘逃荒、要饭，过着牛马不如的生活。是毛主席他老人家把我这个苦孩子从旧社会解放出来，是毛主席他老人家的光辉思想哺育我成长，是他老人家支持我们工人阶级走上了管理国家大事的政治舞台。真是爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，天大地大不如党的恩情大。我想起了他老人家，就有说不尽的知心话；看到他老人家的画像，就浑身是力量；学习了他老人家的光辉思想，就能在风浪中不迷航。我这个苦孩子，多年来就盼望着参加毛主席他老人家亲手缔造亲自领导的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我厂的代理人，长期以来推行了一整套修正主义的建党路线，反对毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，向我们工人阶级散布什么“阶级斗争熄灭论”，“驯服工具论”等反动谬论，妄图把我们无产阶级的政党变成修正主义的党，妄图把广大党员、革命工人变成他们复辟资本主义的
  “驯服工具”。我厂和全国一样，在建设一个什么党的问题上，一直存在着两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争。
    当我第一次提出入党申请时，我厂走资派就胡说什么，好好生产，生产好就能入党。根本不提活学活用毛泽东思想。当我们响应林副主席号召，活学活用毛泽东思想，加强世界观的改造的时候，我厂的走资派却鬼鬼祟祟地把黑《修养》塞给我们，还说，学好这个就可以入党。
    我们厂的走资派还千方百计地把一小撮叛徒、特务、国民党残渣余孽拉进党内，而把许多朝气蓬勃的优秀工人排除在外。当我们工人阶级抑制不住心头的怒火，勇敢地和他们一伙斗争时，走资派又说，你们不懂得“政策”，你们太“刺头”，这样会影响你入党。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派识破了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，起来造了他们的反，夺了他们的权。
    毛主席教导我们说：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成”。我们工人阶级要加入自己的先锋队，决不是为了作“官”，决不是为了什么个人的私利，而是要在毛主席的亲切关怀下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的照耀下，锤炼自己对毛主席的无限忠心，把自己锻炼成为永远捍卫毛主席革命路线，在对敌斗争中冲锋陷阵的坚强战士。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们造走资派的反，是为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线；我们夺走资派的权，是为了巩固无产阶级专政，保证社会主义铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。
    现在，我虽然不是一个共产党员，但是我坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，发扬彻底革命精神，积极地投入整党运动，促使我们的党建设成为一个“无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”今后我一定要遵照毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的条件，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，经常参加生产劳动，密切联系群众，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神改造自己的世界观，尽快地把自己锻炼成为一个无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命战士。
