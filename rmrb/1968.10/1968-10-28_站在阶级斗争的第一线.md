During this great party rectification and building movement, we, the broad masses of party members, have followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle" and stood on the frontline of class struggle. Together with the broad masses, we have rooted out all the remnants of the Kuomintang that had infiltrated the party. This has made us understand more deeply that the Communist Party is about class struggle, and Communist Party members must always prioritize class struggle.

China's Khrushchev absurdly claims that "there are no more classes and class struggle in our country." He absurdly says that the task of our people and party is to "develop productive forces as quickly as possible" and "organize social life." He attempts to drag Communist Party members into a dead-end of focusing solely on production and ignoring class struggle, truly a pipe dream.

Has class struggle really "extinguished"? Let China's Khrushchev open his dog eyes and see the ironclad facts! The class struggle at our Zhenjiang Station has not "extinguished" for a single moment. A capitalist roader in our station once absurdly claimed that "safety is the father, technology is the son, with these two things you are a good worker, a good party member." Under this pretense, he engaged in activities of surrendering and colluding with the enemy, forming factions, and nepotism. He placed counter-revolutionaries and released criminals in key positions at the station, giving them titles like "technical experts" and "production models," promoting and giving them raises, allowing them to once again dominate the working class. As for the broad masses of workers, he used the excuse of "technical incompetence" to exclude, suppress, and make things difficult for them in every way. Isn't this class struggle?

The shocking class struggle facts at our station tell us: class struggle in the socialist period is sharp and complex. If the proletariat does not seize political power from the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, the bourgeoisie will seize political power from the proletariat and the working masses. We must never relax our revolutionary vigilance. China's Khrushchev's theory of the "extinction of class struggle" is a narcotic that numbs Communist Party members and revolutionary masses. If we fall for his tricks, our party will degenerate, capitalism will be restored, and the working people will suffer twice.

We, the broad masses of Communist Party members armed with Mao Zedong Thought, must always keep the string of class struggle taut in our minds, forever stand at the forefront of class struggle, and continuously launch attacks on the class enemy. We will never let China's Khrushchev's plots succeed.

    站在阶级斗争的第一线
    镇江站工人　朱帮庆
    在这次伟大的整党建党运动中，我们站广大党员遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，站在阶级斗争的第一线，与广大群众一起，把混入党内的国民党残渣余孽统统揪了出来。这使我们更深刻地理解到：共产党就是搞阶级斗争的，共产党员任何时候都要把阶级斗争放在首位。
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“在我国再也没有阶级和阶级斗争了”。他胡说“我国人民和党的任务”“就是尽快地发展生产力”，“组织社会生活”，妄图把共产党员拉到埋头生产、不问阶级斗争的死胡同里去，真是白日作梦。
    阶级斗争真的“熄灭”了吗？中国赫鲁晓夫睁开狗眼看看铁的事实吧！我们镇江站的阶级斗争一分一秒也没有“熄灭”过。我们站上一个走资派，曾经胡说什么“安全是老子，技术是儿子，有了这两样就是好工人，好党员”。在这个幌子下，他大搞招降纳叛、结党营私的勾当。他把反革命分子、劳改释放犯等安插在车站要害部门，还给他们挂上“技术能手”、“生产标兵”等头衔，不断提职加薪，让他们重新骑在工人头上，专我们工人阶级的政。而对广大工人，则借口“技术差”，排挤打击，多方刁难。这些不是阶级斗争又是什么？
    我们站的这些触目惊心的阶级斗争事实告诉我们：社会主义时期的阶级斗争是尖锐复杂的。无产阶级不专资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政，资产阶级就要专无产阶级和劳动群众的政。我们绝不能放松革命警惕性。中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，是麻痹共产党员和革命群众的腐蚀剂。如果上了他的当，我们的党就会变质，资本主义就会复辟，劳动人民就会受二遍苦。
    我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大共产党员，一定要把头脑中阶级斗争这根弦始终拉得紧紧的，永远站在阶级斗争最前列，不断向阶级敌人进攻，决不让中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋得逞。
