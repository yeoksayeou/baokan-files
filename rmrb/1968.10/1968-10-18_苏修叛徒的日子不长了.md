The days of the Soviet revisionist traitors are numbered. The small globe has a few flies bumping into walls. Currently, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is like flies in late autumn, flying and crashing about, drawing closer to their doom day by day.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has fully restored capitalism in the Soviet Union. A handful of new bourgeois masters ride roughshod over the people, making the domestic economy a mess and turning the whole society into a stinking cesspool. The reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist traitors is increasingly causing serious discontent among the broad masses of the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of various countries, suppresses the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries. It also frantically pushes forward neo-colonialism, controlling and plundering other countries in an attempt to re-divide the world. The social imperialism of the Soviet revisionist traitors is increasingly facing strong opposition from the revolutionary peoples of the world. Internally and externally beset with difficulties, their days are hard to get through. This is the current plight of the traitors Brezhnev and Kosygin and their ilk.

At the same time, the contradictions within the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its lackeys are rapidly developing. The recent events in Czechoslovakia are a stark exposure of the extreme sharpness of the internal contradictions within the entire modern revisionist clique. The Soviet revisionist clique had to dispatch hundreds of thousands of troops to occupy Czechoslovakia, which clearly shows that it can no longer control its lackeys with a command stick. It mistakenly thinks that it can maintain its shaky hegemony by killing the chicken to scare the monkeys. But it has miscalculated. The invasion of Czechoslovakia not only puts the Soviet revisionists in the position of being universally condemned like rats crossing the street, but also causes the entire modern revisionist clique to be in a state of uproar, making it impossible to manage the mess.

The disintegration of the modern revisionist clique is not accidental.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique and its lackeys are a bunch of big and small traitors and strike-breakers. Their interests are aligned in maintaining the capitalist system and suppressing the working masses, but their relationships are filled with conflicts of interest, constantly fighting openly and covertly, and even resorting to violence in intense situations.

The storm of world people's revolutionary struggles has dealt a heavy blow to the modern revisionist clique. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought, widely spread, points the way forward for the revolutionary peoples of the world; the victorious development of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has inspired the revolutionary spirit of the peoples of various countries. The anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the people of the world are surging. In the Soviet Union and other countries where the revisionist clique is in power, fires of resistance against the reactionary rule of the revisionist clique have been ignited. The traitors of modern revisionism have already been surrounded by the peoples of the world. This has accelerated the disintegration within the modern revisionist clique.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The broad masses of the people, the broad ranks of Party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long." The Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stand firmly with the class brothers in the Soviet Union and wholeheartedly support the struggle of the Soviet working class against the revisionist rule. We are firmly convinced that the Soviet working class and the broad masses of laboring people, with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, will surely wield the great hammer of revolution, smashing the revisionist rule to smithereens, and seize back the power into their own hands, leading the motherland back to the socialist road. The great banner of Lenin and Stalin will surely fly high and forever in the sky over the homeland of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union!

    苏修叛徒的日子不长了
    北京新华印刷厂革命委员会
    小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。当前，苏修叛徒集团就象深秋的苍蝇一样，乱飞乱闯，一天一天接近它的末日。
    苏修叛徒集团在苏联全面复辟了资本主义。一小撮新的资产阶级老爷们骑在人民头上作威作福，把国内经济搞得乱七八糟，整个社会变得乌烟瘴气。苏修叛徒集团的反动统治，越来越引起苏联广大人民的严重不满。苏修叛徒集团在国外勾结美帝国主义和各国反动派，镇压各国人民的革命运动；并且疯狂推行新殖民主义，对其它国家进行控制和掠夺，妄图重新瓜分世界。苏修叛徒集团的社会帝国主义，越来越受到世界革命人民的强烈反对。内外交困，日子难熬，这就是勃列日涅夫、柯西金这伙叛徒目前的处境。
    在这同时，苏修叛徒集团和它的娄罗之间的矛盾也在急剧发展。最近的捷克斯洛伐克事件，就是整个现代修正主义集团内部矛盾极端尖锐的大暴露。苏修集团不得不出动几十万军队占领捷克斯洛伐克，有力地表明了它靠指挥棒摆布它的娄罗已经不行了。它妄想用杀鸡给猴看的办法，来维持摇摇欲坠的霸主地位。但是，它的算盘打错了。对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，不但使苏修在全世界处于老鼠过街人人喊打的地位，而且整个现代修正主义集团内部也吵吵嚷嚷，闹得不可开交。苏修叛徒集团的烂摊子更加无法收拾了。
    现代修正主义集团日益分崩离析，这决不是偶然的。
    苏修叛徒集团和它的娄罗们，是一批大大小小的叛徒和工贼。他们在维护资本主义制度和镇压工人群众方面，利益是一致的，但是它们之间的关系，就象资产阶级和资产阶级的关系一样，充满着利害冲突，不断地明争暗斗，甚至在激烈的时候可以发展到动刀动枪的地步。
    世界人民革命斗争的风暴，给予现代修正主义集团以极其沉重的打击。战无不胜的毛泽东思想的广泛传播，向全世界革命人民指明了前进的方向；中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，激发了各国人民的革命造反精神。全世界人民的反帝反修斗争日益高涨。在苏联和其它修正主义集团掌权的国家里，燃起了反对修正主义集团反动统治的火苗。现代修正主义的叛徒们，已经陷于全世界人民的重重包围之中。这就加速了现代修正主义集团内部的分崩离析。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级和广大人民，坚决同苏联的阶级兄弟们站在一起，全力支持苏联工人阶级反对修正主义统治的斗争。我们坚信，具有十月革命光荣传统的苏联工人阶级和广大劳动人民，必将抡起革命的大铁锤，把修正主义的统治砸个稀巴烂，把政权重新夺回自己的手中，使祖国回到社会主义的道路上来。列宁、斯大林的伟大旗帜，一定会在十月革命的故乡苏联上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
