The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, which entered Zhengzhou Institute of Technology, is holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on strong proletarian political leadership, and firmly grasping class struggle. They have guided the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school to actively engage in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, making the entire school's appearance completely renewed.

Zhengzhou Institute of Technology was a well-known "old difficult" unit among Zhengzhou's institutions of higher learning. Due to a handful of class enemies creating divisions and inciting people to fight against each other, and some people being influenced by bourgeois factionalism, before the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the school, there were many opposing factions within the school that had been fighting each other for a long time, seriously hindering the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

After the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, which includes soldiers, entered the school, they went deep into the broad revolutionary teachers and students, actively propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and conducting thorough and detailed investigations and research. They grasped the situation of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines within the school, as well as the current trends in class struggle. At the same time, they also understood the dynamic thoughts of the masses, finding the main obstacles to the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Based on the investigation and research, the comrades in the propaganda team repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the command, the soul, and "grasping ideological education is the central link for uniting the entire party to engage in great political struggles." They deeply realized that the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team must fully play the leading role of the working class, implement strong proletarian political leadership over the school, and must arm the masses with great Mao Zedong Thought, quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and use the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to unify the thoughts and actions of the revolutionary teachers and students throughout the school.

Based on this understanding, the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team vigorously promoted the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions throughout the school. They followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," organizing revolutionary teachers and students from classes to departments to universally hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, quickly solving many long-standing issues. The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team focused on the main issue of the revolutionary committee not being established for a long time, guiding revolutionary teachers and students in the study classes to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as weapons, linking them to reality, criticizing and repudiating private and revisionist thoughts, fiercely criticizing the bourgeois reactionary theory of "multiple centers mean no center," fiercely criticizing factionalism and cliquism, fully exposing the evil plots of a handful of class enemies to sabotage revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. This strengthened the unity of the revolutionary teachers and students, united them against the enemy, promoted revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Within just ten days after the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the school, revolutionary committees were established from the institute to the departments, and all grassroots units.

Vice Chairman Lin instructed: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, in order to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on re-educating intellectuals, widely carried out activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, taking class education as an important lesson in re-educating revolutionary teachers and students. The old workers' bitter complaints about the old society aroused the revolutionary teachers and students' hatred towards the class enemies. They all expressed their determination to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings and carry the educational revolution to the end.

After the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered Zhengzhou Institute of Technology, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," they also carried out heart-to-heart talks with the broad revolutionary teachers and students, repeatedly doing patient and detailed ideological and political work, guiding the teachers and students to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions to examine and check themselves, quickly uniting the broad revolutionary teachers and students, carrying out revolutionary criticism, and exposing a handful of class enemies.

Currently, the broad revolutionary teachers and students of Zhengzhou Institute of Technology are universally carrying out the "three loyalties" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have launched a movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation is surging throughout the school.

    工人毛泽东思想宣传队解决了“老大难”问题
    郑州工学院面貌焕然一新
    据新华社郑州二十日电　进驻郑州工学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持实行坚强的无产阶级政治领导，狠抓阶级斗争，引导全院革命师生积极投入学校的斗、批、改，使全院面貌焕然一新。
    郑州工学院是郑州高等学校中有名的“老大难”单位。由于一小撮阶级敌人制造分裂，挑动群众斗群众，加上有些人资产阶级派性作怪，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻以前，学校里存在着许多互相对立的小山头，长期“内战”不休，严重地阻碍了学校斗、批、改的进行。
    有解放军参加的工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校后，深入到广大革命师生中，一面积极宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，一面开展深入细致的调查研究工作，掌握学校阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的情况和当前阶级斗争的新动向，同时也了解群众的活思想，找到了妨碍斗、批、改的主要障碍。在调查研究的基础上，宣传队的同志反复学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，深刻认识到，工人毛泽东思想宣传队要充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，要对学校实行坚强的无产阶级政治领导，就必须用伟大毛泽东思想武装群众，迅速落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，用以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，去统一全校革命师生的认识和行动。
    根据这个认识，工人毛泽东思想宣传队就在全校范围内大张旗鼓地大抓落实毛主席的最新指示。他们遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，组织革命师生从班系到院部普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班，使许多长期纠缠不休的问题迅速得到了解决。工人毛泽东思想宣传队抓住院革命委员会迟迟建立不起来这个主要问题，在学习班里引导革命师生以毛主席的最新指示为武器，联系实际，斗私批修，狠批资产阶级反动的“多中心即无中心论”，狠批山头主义、宗派主义，充分揭露一小撮阶级敌人破坏革命大联合和革命三结合的罪恶阴谋，使革命师生增强了团结，共同对敌，促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校后短短十天的时间内，从院到系，各基层单位都成立了革委会。
    林副主席指示说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”工人毛泽东思想宣传队为了落实毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的最新指示，广泛开展忆苦思甜活动，把阶级教育作为对革命师生进行再教育的重要一课。老工人们对旧社会的血泪控诉，激发了革命师生对阶级敌人的仇恨，他们纷纷表示，决心遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把教育革命进行到底。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻郑州工学院以后，遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，还和广大革命师生开展谈心活动，反复做耐心细致的思想政治工作，引导师生们用毛主席的最新指示对照检查自己，使广大革命师生迅速团结起来，开展了革命大批判，揪出了一小撮阶级敌人。
    目前，郑州工学院广大革命师生普遍开展了忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的运动，一个斗、批、改高潮正在全校兴起。
