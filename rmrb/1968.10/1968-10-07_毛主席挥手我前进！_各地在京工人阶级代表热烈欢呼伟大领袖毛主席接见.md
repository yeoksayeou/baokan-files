Chairman Mao Waves, We Advance!
— Workers from Various Places in Beijing Warmly Cheer the Great Leader Chairman Mao's Reception

In the great annals of the working class taking the stage of the superstructure in the struggle to criticize and reform politics, October 5, 1968, was written as the most brilliant chapter: Our great teacher, the great leader of the working class and the broad masses of laboring people, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, received the outstanding representatives of the working class from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations at the majestic Great Hall of the People in the capital. This is the greatest honor and happiness for the working class and the people of the entire nation!

Chairman Mao's heart is connected with the working class, the working class is most loyal and closest to Chairman Mao, and follows Chairman Mao the closest! The working class always thinks of Chairman Mao!

At 8:40 PM on October 5, Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and vigorous steps, came to the Great Hall of the People in high spirits to visit the worker comrades. Chairman Mao warmly waved to everyone. The outstanding representatives of the working class, who are infinitely loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao, were moved and excited, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouting thousands of times, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Day after day, night after night, the long-awaited wish to see the great leader Chairman Mao finally came true. The representatives sang the song "Chairman Mao, we will forever be loyal to you" with great emotion and spontaneously danced to the song "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life." Many people had tears of joy on their faces, opened the revolutionary treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and wrote down this unforgettable and happiest moment in their lives, vowing, "Infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good worker for Chairman Mao."

After the reception, Tiananmen Square was in a festive mood. Many representatives gathered in the rain in front of Tiananmen, once again pledging their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They solemnly swore in front of Chairman Mao's giant portrait. In the rain, they sang and danced, over and over again, passionately singing, "The party's favor is greater than the sky and the earth, parents' love is not as close as Chairman Mao's love."

Zhang Moxi, a representative from Chairman Mao's hometown in Hunan Province and an old worker from Xiangnan Steel Plant, was particularly excited. This person, who had begged for food everywhere in the old society and suffered greatly from landlords and capitalists, had long wanted to see Chairman Mao. Now, his most beautiful wish has come true! This time, the masses nominated him to go to Chairman Mao's side to participate in the National Day celebrations. He traveled from Xiangtan to Changsha, from Changsha to Beijing. Along the way, the masses sent him off, gave him red flowers, and repeatedly instructed him to quickly convey the good news of seeing Chairman Mao. He carried the heavy responsibility of the broad masses of workers and, with a surging heart, thought along the way: If it were not for Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the working class would not have today! After the reception, Zhang Moxi quickly ran back to his residence to make phone calls and send telegrams to report the good news to his comrades in Hunan: "The great leader Chairman Mao received us, and he is in extremely good health!"

"The Yarlung Zangbo River is long, but not as long as Chairman Mao's favor; Mount Everest is high, but not as high as Chairman Mao's favor." The Tibetan workers' representatives, most of whom were former serfs, each have a tragic history of blood and tears. It was Chairman Mao who saved them from the sea of suffering and nurtured them into the first generation of industrial workers in Tibet. Today, they jumped and sang with joy: Dear Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts. We have seen you today, and we are the happiest people in the world!

The nearly 10,000 worker representatives who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations all have a history of suffering in the old society. At the happy moment of being received by Chairman Mao, they remembered their past sufferings, felt even sweeter today, and felt even closer to Chairman Mao. Chen Beizhen, an old worker from the Guiyang Cotton Textile Mill who used to be a maid for landlords and a child laborer in the old society, today proudly accepted Chairman Mao's inspection as a member of the working class. At this happiest moment, she thought of her parents who were beaten and driven to death by landlords, her little sister who was sold to a fake constable, and her own days of hardship working for capitalists. She thought of the blood and tears of the entire class. She said, it is because of Chairman Mao that the working class has today. We must closely follow Chairman Mao and shoulder the historical responsibility of "the working class must lead everything."

The great leader Chairman Mao's warm reception gave the worker representatives boundless strength. They expressed their determination, made vows, and planned measures. They said, Chairman Mao waves, and we advance! We must closely follow Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, completing the great historical task of criticizing and reforming the superstructure assigned to us by Chairman Mao.

The workers' representatives from the capital received the warm reception of the great leader Chairman Mao on August 15. This time, together with comrades from all over the country, they saw Chairman Mao again. To express the capital's working class's determination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and, together with the working class of the entire nation, lead the criticism and reform of the superstructure, they presented the precious gift from the great leader Chairman Mao—the replica of the mango—to the worker delegations from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The worker representatives from Beijing Knitting Factory, Beijing New China Printing Factory, Beijing Chemical Factory No. 3, Beijing Machine Tool Factory No. 1, Beijing Machine Tool Factory No. 2, and Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory quickly conveyed the good news of seeing Chairman Mao to their factories. The revolutionary workers were greatly inspired. They warmly received the worker representatives from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to visit their factories, learned advanced experiences from comrades from other places, and determined to launch a new high tide of criticism and reform.

Guo Sanzhen, the deputy leader of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from Fudan University and a worker from Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, thought about how to quickly and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions after seeing the great leader Chairman Mao. Deep into the night, she was still writing in her diary with great concentration: Chairman Mao receiving us workers is the greatest encouragement and trust for the working class. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings to do a good job in the criticism and reform of Fudan University and achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

Jiang Fa, a member of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from Guangzhou Medical College Nursing School and an old worker from Guangzhou Heavy Machinery Factory, will retire in two months. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "implementing the proletarian educational revolution, the working class must lead, and the working class must participate," he firmly requested to join the worker propaganda team. He said, "Chairman Mao has waved to us workers, I cannot retire, I must advance!" After entering the school, he used his personal experiences to conduct class education for the youth, organized revolutionary teachers and students to fiercely criticize and denounce the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and quickly mobilized the masses to launch a high tide of criticism and reform. Jiang Fa said after seeing Chairman Mao, "Chairman Mao's every new instruction concentrates the will of the working class and represents the interests of the working class. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions word for word, we will definitely be able to lead everything and do a good job in the criticism and reform, completing the great historical task assigned to us by Chairman Mao."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches, "The working class must also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." The outstanding representatives of the working class from various places, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, are inspired by the great encouragement of Chairman Mao's reception, full of vigor and high spirits. They determinedly raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, better studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, continuously improved their political consciousness, seriously carried out the criticism and reform, promoted production, and achieved a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

    毛主席挥手我前进！
    ——各地在京工人阶级代表热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席接见
    在工人阶级登上上层建筑斗、批、改政治舞台的伟大史册上，一九六八年十月五日又写下了最光辉的一章：我们的伟大导师、工人阶级和广大劳动人民的伟大领袖、我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，在首都雄伟的人民大会堂，接见了来京参加国庆观礼的二十九个省、市、自治区的工人阶级的优秀代表。这是工人阶级和全国人民的最大光荣，最大幸福！
    毛主席和工人阶级心连心，工人阶级对毛主席最忠、最亲，跟毛主席最紧！工人阶级时刻想念毛主席！
    十月五日晚八时四十分，毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕，迈着矫健的步伐，十分高兴地来到人民大会堂，亲切地看望工人同志们。毛主席向大家亲切招手致意。无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席的工人阶级的优秀代表们，心潮澎湃，热血沸腾，挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，千万遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    天天想啊，夜夜盼，渴望见到伟大领袖毛主席的心愿终于实现了。代表们激动地唱起了“毛主席啊，我们永远忠于您”的颂歌，情不自禁地跳起了《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》的舞蹈。许多人脸上挂着幸福的泪花，打开革命宝书《毛主席语录》，在扉页上记下了这一生中最难忘、最幸福的时刻，写下了他们的誓言和决心：“无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。”“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好工人。”
    接见结束后，天安门广场一片欢腾。许多代表冒雨齐集在天安门前，再一次向伟大领袖毛主席敬献忠心。他们在毛主席的巨幅画像前庄严宣誓。他们在雨中载歌载舞，一遍又一遍地纵情高唱：“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”。
    来自伟大领袖毛主席家乡湖南省的代表、湘南钢厂老工人张墨海，特别激动。这个在旧社会到处要饭，受尽地主资本家摧残的穷苦人，早就想见到毛主席。现在，他的最美好的愿望实现了！这次群众推举他到毛主席身边参加国庆观礼，他从湘潭到长沙，从长沙到北京，一路上群众欢送他，给他戴红花，千叮咛，万嘱咐，要他把见到毛主席的喜讯尽快传回去。他带着广大工人群众的重托，一路上心潮翻腾：要不是毛主席的英明领导，工人阶级哪有今天！接见结束后，张墨海飞快跑回住所打电话，拍电报，向湖南战友报喜：“伟大领袖毛主席接见了我们，他老人家身体非常非常健康！”
    “雅鲁藏布江再长，没有毛主席的恩情长，珠穆朗玛峰再高，没有毛主席的恩情高。”西藏工人代表，大多数是过去的农奴，每一个人都有一部悲惨的血泪史，是毛主席把他们从苦海中救了出来，培养成为西藏第一代产业工人。今天，他们尽情欢跳，放声歌唱：敬爱的毛主席，您是我们心中最红的红太阳。我们今天见到了您，我们是世界上最幸福的人！
    这次来京参加国庆观礼的近万名工人代表，在旧社会都有一本血迹斑斑的苦难史。在毛主席接见他们的幸福时刻，他们忆起昔日苦，更觉今日甜，更觉毛主席亲。在旧社会给地主当丫头、做童工的贵阳棉纺织厂的老工人陈北婶，今天豪迈地以工人阶级的一员接受了毛主席的检阅。在这最幸福的时刻，她想起了被地主活活打死逼死的爹娘，想起了给伪保长卖了的小妹妹，想起了自己给资本家做牛做马的苦难日子，想起了整个阶级的血泪仇。她说，有了毛主席，才有工人阶级的今天。我们一定要紧跟毛主席，挑起“工人阶级必须领导一切”的历史重担。
    伟大领袖毛主席的亲切接见，给了工人代表无穷无尽的力量。代表们纷纷表决心，立誓言，订措施。他们说，毛主席挥手我前进！我们一定紧跟毛主席，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，完成毛主席交给我们的搞好上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的伟大历史任务。
    首都工人代表八月十五日受到了伟大领袖毛主席的亲切接见，这次，和全国各地的战友们一起，又一次见到了毛主席。为了表达首都工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同全国工人阶级一道，领导上层建筑各个领域搞好斗、批、改的决心，他们把伟大领袖毛主席赠送给首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的珍贵礼物——芒果的复制品，分别赠送给全国各地工人代表团。北京针织总厂、北京新华印刷厂、北京化工三厂、北京第一机床厂、北京第二机床厂、北京光华木材厂等厂的工人代表，把见到毛主席的喜讯迅速传回工厂。广大革命职工受到了极大鼓舞。他们热情接待各省、市、自治区的工人代表来厂参观，向外地战友学习先进经验，决心掀起斗、批、改的新高潮。
    上海复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队副团长、上海柴油机厂工人郭三珍，见到伟大领袖毛主席后，一直在想着如何迅速全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把复旦大学的教育革命进行到底。夜深了，她还在聚精会神地写日记：毛主席接见我们工人代表，这是对我们工人阶级的最大鼓舞，最大信任。我们决不辜负毛主席的期望，一定遵照毛主席的教导，把复旦大学的斗、批、改搞好，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中立新功。
    广州中山医学院护士学校工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员、广州重型机械厂的老工人江发，再有两个月就该退休了，毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加”的最新指示发出后，他坚决要求参加了工人宣传队。他说：“毛主席向我们工人阶级挥手了，我不能退休，我要前进！”他进驻学校后，以他的亲身经历，向青年进行阶级教育，组织革命师生狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义教育路线的滔天罪行，很快发动群众掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。江发见到毛主席以后无比激动地说：“毛主席的每一个最新指示都集中了我们工人阶级的意志，都代表了我们工人阶级的利益，只要我们一字一句照毛主席的指示办事，我们一定能够领导一切，一定能搞好斗、批、改，完成毛主席交给我们的伟大历史任务。”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”无限忠于毛主席的各地工人阶级的优秀代表们，在毛主席接见的巨大鼓舞下，意气风发，斗志昂扬，他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高政治觉悟，认真搞好斗、批、改，抓革命、促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
