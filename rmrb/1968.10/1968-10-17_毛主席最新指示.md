A person has arteries and veins, through which blood circulates via the heart, and also needs the lungs to breathe, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is what is known as "exhaling the old and inhaling the new." A proletarian party must also exhale the old and inhale the new to remain vigorous. Without eliminating waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lack vitality.

Where does our power come from? It comes from the working class, from the poor and lower-middle peasants, from the vast majority of the laboring people who make up more than ninety percent of the population. We represent the proletariat, we represent the people, we have overthrown the enemies of the people, and thus the people support us. The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses of the people.

    毛主席最新指示
    一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。
    我们的权力是谁给的？是工人阶级给的，是贫下中农给的，是占人口百分之九十以上的广大劳动群众给的。我们代表了无产阶级，代表了人民群众，打倒了人民的敌人，人民就拥护我们。共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。
