Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Wuxi Silk Reeling Plant No. 1 Serve as Both Officials and Common People, Insisting on the System of Cadres Participating in Production Labor

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 18 — The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Wuxi Silk Reeling Plant No. 1 in Jiangsu province have been striving for their own ideological revolution, consistently insisting on participating in collective production labor, serving as both officials and common people, and maintaining close ties with the broad masses of workers.

The committee has 19 members, 17 of whom are workers or worker representatives. After the committee was established, all members studied Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings on "the necessity of maintaining the system of cadres participating in collective production labor" and deeply understood the importance of cadres participating in collective production labor. They then established a system for participating in production labor.

After the system was established, all members often appeared among the masses as ordinary laborers, working and chatting with them. They could promptly discover the masses' experiences and creations, promptly understand the masses' opinions, demands, and wishes, and promptly solve problems among the masses. In a previous stage, the revolutionary criticism in this plant was limited to large-scale criticism meetings. Members of the plant's Revolutionary Committee went deep into the machinery workshop, worked with the workers, and helped them conduct revolutionary criticism with the workshop as the base. After gaining experience, they immediately promoted it throughout the plant, driving the development of the plant's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee insisted on participating in production labor, promoting ideological revolution, and integrating with the broad masses of workers in terms of thoughts, feelings, and work style. One revolutionary cadre, originally a worker, had not insisted on participating in production labor and had become estranged from the workers, unable to do a good job, and even blamed the workers for being backward. Later, she went to the workshop to participate in production labor, was tempered through labor, and deeply felt that it was not the workers who were backward but herself who had become estranged from the masses. Thus, she put down her airs, humbly learned from the workers during labor, and humbly listened to the workers' opinions, integrating with the masses.

All members of the Revolutionary Committee actively participated in production labor, maintaining the excellent qualities of the working class, and were praised by the broad masses of workers in the plant. An old worker from the machinery workshop said, "Our machinery workshop is the hardest and dirtiest place in the whole plant. In the past, the capitalist roaders not only did not come to the workshop to work but did not even come to take a look. Now, the responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Committee are working in our workshop, choosing the heaviest work, and not resting even when their hands are blistered. Such revolutionary cadres, we welcome them!"

    无锡缫丝一厂革委会成员既当“官”又当老百姓
    坚持干部参加生产劳动的制度
    新华社南京十八日电　江苏无锡缫丝一厂革命委员会成员狠抓自身思想革命化，始终坚持参加集体生产劳动，做到既当“官”，又当老百姓，同广大工人群众保持密切联系。
    这个厂的革委会共有十九个委员，其中工人出身的干部和工人代表占十七人。革委会成立后，全体委员认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度”的教导，深刻地认识了干部参加集体生产劳动的重要意义，并且建立了参加生产劳动的制度。
    制度建立以后，全体委员经常以普通劳动者的姿态出现在群众之中，同群众一道劳动，一道谈心，群众的经验和创造，能够及时发现，群众的意见、要求和愿望，能够及时了解，群众中的问题能够及时解决。前一阶段，这个厂的革命大批判老是停留在大会批判上。厂革委会委员深入到机动车间，同工人一起劳动，并且帮助大家以班组为基点开展革命大批判，取得经验以后，又立即在全厂推广，推动了全厂斗、批、改的发展。
    厂革委会委员坚持参加生产劳动，促进了思想革命化，从思想感情到工作作风，都同广大工人群众打成一片。有个革命干部是工人出身，但是由于没有坚持参加生产劳动，同工人疏远了，做不好工作，还责怪工人落后。以后她下车间参加了生产劳动，从劳动中得到了锻炼，深深感到不是工人落后，而是自己脱离了群众。于是，她放下架子，在劳动中虚心向工人学习，虚心听取工人的意见，和群众打成了一片。
    厂革委会全体委员积极参加生产劳动，保持了工人阶级的优秀品质，受到全厂广大工人的赞扬。机动车间的老工人说：“我们机动车间是全厂工作最重、最脏的地方，过去走资派不要说不到车间劳动，连看都不来看看。现在，革委会负责同志就在我们车间劳动，工作拣重的做，手上磨出了泡，也不休息。这样的革命干部，我们就是欢迎！”
