A Vivid On-Site Criticism Meeting

One day, shortly after the end-of-shift bell rang at the Zhangjiakou Coal Machinery Factory, the carpenters' workshop echoed with the thunderous cry, "Down with China's Khrushchev!" This was the sound of workers and revolutionary teachers and students from Zhangjiakou No. 1 Middle School holding an on-site criticism meeting in the workshop.

Since the revolutionary teachers and students from No. 1 Middle School came to the workshop with the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, they studied, worked, and criticized and repudiated revisionism together with the worker comrades. Deep class feelings were forged. Many revolutionary students regarded this opportunity to participate in labor as a good chance to receive re-education from the working class. However, there were a few students who had other ideas, hoping to use this chance to learn some skills so they could have an easier time in the factory later. Therefore, they did not want to do small, miscellaneous tasks but were eager to tackle technical jobs. The worker comrades saw through the youngsters' thoughts and believed that they had been poisoned by China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, pursuing "first in grades" at school and "first in skills" at the factory. If this way of thinking was not criticized, it would lead the revolutionary youngsters down the path of being "red and expert" only. After discussing with the workshop's leading group, the workers' propaganda team decided to drag the factory's reactionary technical "authorities" and the stubborn capitalist-roaders from No. 1 Middle School to the site for criticism. The workers' sharp criticism greatly inspired the revolutionary teachers and students. They were filled with indignation towards the capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" before them and strongly denounced China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line of "academics first" and "grades first." They said, "The reason we pursued 'first in grades' at school and 'first in skills' at the factory is that China's Khrushchev poisoned us. We must settle this account thoroughly!" Several Red Guards could no longer suppress their inner excitement and took turns going on stage to denounce and criticize: "We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and resolutely take the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers!"

The great criticism greatly enhanced the revolutionary teachers and students' awareness of the two-line struggle. The youngsters no longer distinguished between heavy and light tasks, or between miscellaneous and technical jobs; everyone rushed to do them. They were not afraid of hardship or fatigue and actively participated in political activities after work, determined to sincerely receive re-education from the working class in class struggle and production struggle.

    一场生动的现场批判会
    一天，张家口煤机厂下班铃声响过不久，机工车间“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”的愤怒呼声震天动地。这是车间的工人和来厂参加劳动的张家口一中革命师生在开现场批判会。
    自从一中革命师生随工人毛泽东思想宣传队来车间后，他们和工人师傅同学习，同劳动，同斗私批修，结下了深厚的阶级感情。许多革命师生把这次参加劳动当作接受工人阶级再教育的好机会。可是，也有少数同学打起了“小算盘”，想借此机会学两手技术，将来到工厂还吃得开。因此，不想干零星小活，而对技术性强的活积极肯干。工人同志摸透了小将们的心理活动，认为他们是受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒害，在学校追求“分数第一”，到工厂追求“技术第一”。这种思想如果不加批判，就会使革命小将走上只专不红的邪路。工人宣传队和车间领导小组商量后，决定把本厂的反动技术“权威”和一中的顽固不化的走资派揪到现场进行批判。工人同志一针见血的批判，给了广大革命师生极大的启发。他们对眼前的走资派、反动技术“权威”，心头冒起万丈怒火，对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“智育第一”、“分数第一”的修正主义教育路线进行了强有力的控诉。他们说：“我们之所以在学校追求‘分数第一’，进工厂向往‘技术第一’，就是中国赫鲁晓夫毒害了我们，这笔账我们一定要彻底清算！”几个红卫兵小将再也抑制不住内心的激情，纷纷走上台控诉批判：“我们一定要肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒，坚决走和工农兵相结合的道路！”
    革命大批判，大大提高了革命师生的两条路线斗争觉悟，小将们从此不分重活累活，零活技术活，人人抢着干。他们不怕苦不怕累，下班以后积极参加政治活动，决心在阶级斗争和生产斗争中诚诚恳恳地接受工人阶级的再教育。
