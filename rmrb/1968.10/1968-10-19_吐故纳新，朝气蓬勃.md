	Renew and Revitalize, Full of Vigour
	Comrade Liu Fengqi, Member of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Mucity Gully Coal Mine

	Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "A proletarian party must also renew and revitalize itself to remain full of vigour. Without eliminating the dross and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lack vigour." We revolutionary workers at Mucity Gully Coal Mine have personally felt, from our initial experience in rectifying the entire mine, that Chairman Mao's latest directive is a universal truth.

	In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within our mine, in terms of party building, consistently propagated the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of the tamed tool," pulling traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, class enemies, and degenerate elements into the party, while excluding many excellent workers who insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts and fought in the forefront of class struggle and production struggle. Therefore, the party organization became seriously impure, lacking revolutionary vigour, and failed to function as a battle command post.

	In February this year, with the help of the People's Liberation Army propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great directive that "the party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against the class enemy, a vigorous vanguard organization full of vigour," the entire mine launched a rectification movement. During the rectification movement, we first mobilized the masses to launch a thorough criticism of the revisionist line of party building, raising the political consciousness of the masses. Then, we expelled those counter-revolutionaries with conclusive evidence from the party. We also recruited 22 new party members from among the excellent workers and promoted those new and old Communist Party members who are loyal to Chairman Mao, actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, have vigour, and are closely connected with the masses to leadership positions within the party organization. This greatly enhanced the fighting capacity of the party organization.

	In the past, the capitalist-roaders in the party branch of the Coal Mine Electrical and Mechanical Department persecuted party members who dared to insist on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and fight for principles. They implemented a policy of closure, blockade, punishment, and suppression against the broad revolutionary masses of workers. It was truly a case of the bad people in power and the good people suffering, with production suffering as a result. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this party branch has completely changed. A handful of capitalist-roaders have been overthrown, and a batch of excellent proletarian advanced elements have been recruited into the party. Those excellent party members have been selected for leadership positions within the party organization, truly putting the leadership of the party organization in the hands of Communist Party members who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Young worker Wang Weirong, after being recruited into the party, took on the position of deputy secretary of the party branch. He broke away from the old circle, leading the broad party members and revolutionary masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasping the fundamentals and not wavering. Within the party, he actively carried out ideological struggles. Regardless of whether you are an old party member, old cadre, or veteran worker, if you go against Chairman Mao's teachings and do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, he would criticize you. At the same time, he maintained close ties with the masses, consulted with the masses on all matters, rooted himself among the masses, and studied and worked with the masses. Whatever amount of oil and mud the workers had on them, he had the same amount on him. Whatever amount of sweat the workers shed, he shed the same amount. He set an example for the broad party members and revolutionary masses.

	Party branch committee member and new party member Zhang Liandeng, during a mission to conduct external investigations, encountered a very difficult problem and fell ill himself. Should he retreat or continue the fight? He thought, as a Communist Party member, he must complete the task assigned by the party organization. Thus, with unwavering confidence, he persisted in the fight despite his illness. In the face of inconvenient transportation, he walked over three thousand miles and interviewed more than twenty people, finally clarifying the issue of a person with an unclear political history who had infiltrated the party for more than twenty years.

	Under the leadership of the new party organization, the entire mine has been completing the national coal production plan in excess every month. In October, despite the participation of a large number of excellent workers in the propaganda teams entering various fields of the superstructure to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation, the mine still exceeded the highest historical monthly production. The masses say: Our mine's party members have never been as spirited and full of vigour as they are today, the party-mass relationship has never been as close as it is today, and the revolutionary enthusiasm has never been as abundant as it is today.

    吐故纳新，朝气蓬勃
    北京木城涧煤矿革命委员会委员　刘凤岐
    毛主席最近深刻指出：“一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”我们木城涧煤矿的革命职工从全矿整党的初步经验中，亲切地体会到毛主席这一最新指示，是放之四海而皆准的真理。
    过去我们矿党内一小撮走资派，在建党方面，一贯宣扬中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“驯服工具论”等反革命修正主义黑货，把一些叛徒、特务、反革命分子、阶级异己分子和蜕化变质分子拉入党内，而对不少坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，在阶级斗争、生产斗争中冲锋陷阵的优秀工人却拒之门外。因此，使党组织严重不纯，缺乏革命朝气，起不到战斗指挥部的作用。
    今年二月，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照毛主席关于“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”的伟大教导，全矿开展了整党运动。在整党运动中，首先发动群众开展对修正主义建党路线的大批判，提高群众的政治觉悟，接着将那些证据确凿的反革命分子清除出党，又从优秀工人中吸收了二十二名新党员，并把那些忠于毛主席、活学活用毛泽东思想较好的、有朝气、紧密联系群众的新老共产党员提拔到党组织的领导岗位上，这就大大增强了党组织的战斗力。
    过去，煤矿机电科党支部的走资派，对敢于坚持活学活用毛泽东思想、坚持原则斗争的党员进行政治迫害，对广大革命工人群众实行关、卡、罚、压。真是坏人掌权，好人受气，生产遭殃。经过无产阶级文化大革命，这个党支部完全变了样，一小撮走资派被打倒了，一批优秀的无产阶级先进分子被吸收入党，并把那些优秀的党员选拔到党组织的领导岗位上来，使党组织的领导权真正掌握在那些忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的共产党员手里。
    青年工人王维荣，被吸收入党以后，担任了党支部副书记的职务。他跳出过去的老圈子，带领广大党员和革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓根本不转向。他在党内积极开展思想斗争，不管你是老党员、老干部、老师傅，只要你违背毛主席的教导，不符合毛泽东思想，他就要提出批评。同时，他密切联系群众，遇事和群众商量，扎根于群众中，和群众同学习、同劳动。工人身上有多少油泥，他身上有多少油泥，工人流多少汗，他流多少汗，为广大党员和革命群众作出了榜样。
    党支部委员、新党员张连登，在一次执行外调任务时，遇到一个很难解决的困难，自己身体也有了病。是收兵回营，还是继续战斗？他想，自己是一个共产党员，必须完成党组织交给的任务。于是，他信心百倍地带病坚持战斗，在交通不便的情况下，走了三千多里，找了二十多人次，终于把混进党内二十多年的一个政治历史不清的人的问题调查清楚。
    全矿在新的党组织的领导下，月月超额完成国家产煤计划，十月份在大量优秀工人参加宣传队进入上层建筑各个领域领导斗、批、改的情况下，仍然将超过历史上最高的月产量。群众说：我们矿的党员从来没有象今天这样精神焕发，朝气勃勃，党群关系从来没有象今天这样亲密无间，革命干劲从来没有象今天这样充沛。
