The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Xi'an Highway Institute, following Chairman Mao's great directive to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," has extensively and deeply carried out mass heart-to-heart talk activities. They use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate intellectuals, quickly realizing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, powerfully promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Xi'an Highway Institute is one of the notorious "difficult" units among the colleges and universities in Xi'an. Due to the instigation of a handful of class enemies, the two factions of the institute have been in a state of long-term opposition, with "internal warfare" unending, eight attempts at unity, and eight splits. After the propaganda team entered the school, they went deep into each class and department, living and working with the revolutionary teachers and students, seizing every opportunity to have heart-to-heart talks with them, and propagating Chairman Mao's latest series of directives. They used Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate them. An old worker suffering from severe arthritis, just out of the hospital, participated in the propaganda team's entry into the Automobile Department of this institute. To promote the two factions of students to achieve revolutionary great unity according to the class, he and other comrades of the propaganda team, day and night, talked with the two factions of students, for ten consecutive days. He endured the pain, going back and forth between the two large courtyards where the two factions of students lived, repeatedly propagating Chairman Mao's latest directives. This old worker's talks greatly educated the revolutionary teachers and students, powerfully promoting the revolutionary great unity of this department.

The comrades of the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Xi'an Highway Institute, in the heart-to-heart talk activities, paid attention to analyzing and studying the ideological situation of the teachers and students, achieving targeted education. After the two factions of teachers and students returned to their original classes, there was still a great deal of ideological estrangement. They thought and did far behind the development of the national revolutionary situation. Facing this situation, the comrades of the worker propaganda team, in their heart-to-heart talks with the teachers and students, extensively discussed the great situation of the Cultural Revolution in the country, the province, and the Xi'an region, and emphasized the great significance of achieving revolutionary great unity for doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They guided the revolutionary teachers and students to look at the country, compare with their institute, look at themselves, find the gap, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, keep up with the national situation, and keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Some students are children of workers or poor and lower-middle peasants. The worker comrades of the propaganda team, in their heart-to-heart talks with them, recalled bitterness and sweetness together, conducted class education, aroused their class consciousness, guided them to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, unite as one, and jointly fight against the enemy, achieving good results.

The comrades of the worker propaganda team not only actively sought out revolutionary teachers and students for heart-to-heart talks but also mobilized the broad revolutionary teachers and students to carry out mass heart-to-heart talk activities, with everyone doing ideological and political work. When some classes of students requested unity, but the leaders' thoughts were not clear at the moment, the comrades of the propaganda team guided the students to have heart-to-heart talks with their own leaders, promoting the leaders to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. When some class leaders actively criticized and repudiated revisionism, but a part of the students' thoughts could not keep up, the comrades of the propaganda team guided the leaders to have heart-to-heart talks with the students, leading the students to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives. In the mass heart-to-heart talk activities, the comrades of the worker propaganda team enthusiastically helped those teachers and students who had been in opposition for a long time to form "one helps one, one red pair" pairs, increasing unity through heart-to-heart talks.

Through mass heart-to-heart talk activities and a series of ideological and political work, the revolutionary teachers and students of Xi'an Highway Institute quickly raised their consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, unearthed a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other class enemies, exposed their crimes of instigating the masses to fight against the masses, achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. The comrades of the worker propaganda team, through practice, felt that carrying out heart-to-heart talk activities has many advantages: through heart-to-heart talks, Chairman Mao's directives can be directly sent to the hearts of the teachers and students, speaking deeply and concretely, which is a good form of implementing and executing Chairman Mao's directives, exercising proletarian political leadership over the institute, and conducting ideological education for revolutionary teachers and students; through mutual heart-to-heart talks and confessions, one word from you, one word from me, can touch the heart, can touch the sore spot, can achieve one key opens one lock, everyone talks more and more closely, more and more intimately, which is a good way to increase unity; talking clearly and asking in detail is a good method of investigation and research.

    进驻西安公路学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队同师生广泛开展谈心活动
    把毛主席的伟大指示送到革命师生心坎上
    提高了革命师生阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，揭发了一小撮阶级敌人挑动群众斗群众的罪行，实现了革命大联合和革命三结合
    据新华社西安二十四日电　进驻西安公路学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的伟大教导，广泛深入地开展群众性的谈心活动，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想对知识分子进行再教育，使这个学校迅速实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，有力地促进了斗、批、改。
    西安公路学院是西安地区大专院校中有名的“老大难”单位之一。由于一小撮阶级敌人的挑动，学院的两派群众组织长期对立，“内战”不休，八次联合，八次分裂。宣传队的同志进驻学校以后，分别深入到各班级、各科室去，和革命师生实行“五同”，利用一切机会和师生们谈心，向他们宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，用毛泽东思想向他们进行再教育。一位患有严重关节炎的老工人，刚出医院就参加宣传队进驻这个学院的汽车系。为了促使两派群众按照班级实现革命大联合，他和宣传队其他同志一起，不分白天黑夜，找两派群众谈心，一连十几天。他忍着疼痛，往来于两派群众分居的两个大院之间，反复宣传毛主席的最新指示。这位老工人的谈话，极大地教育了革命师生，有力地促进了这个系的革命大联合。
    进驻西安公路学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，在谈心活动中，注意分析研究师生的思想状况，做到有的放矢。两派师生回到原班级以后，思想隔阂仍然很大，他们想的做的，远远落后于全国革命形势的发展。针对这种情况，工人宣传队的同志就在同师生们谈心中，大谈全国、全省和西安地区文化大革命的大好形势，大讲实现革命大联合对于搞好斗、批、改的重大意义，引导革命师生看全国，比本院，看自己，找到差距，坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，跟上全国的形势，跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署。有些同学是工人或贫下中农的子弟，宣传队的工人同志就在谈心中，和他们一起忆苦思甜，进行阶级教育，启发他们的阶级觉悟，引导他们分清敌我，团结一致，共同对敌，收到了很好的效果。
    工人宣传队的同志不仅自己主动找革命师生谈心，而且发动广大革命师生开展群众性的谈心活动，人人做思想政治工作。当有的班级群众要求联合，而头头一时思想不通的时候，宣传队的同志便引导群众找自己的头头谈心，促使头头紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。有些班级的头头主动斗私批修，而一部分群众的思想跟不上来的时候，宣传队的同志便引导头头找群众谈心，带动群众落实毛主席的最新指示。在群众性的谈心活动中，工人宣传队的同志热情地帮助那些长期对立的师生结成“一帮一，一对红”的对子，通过谈心，增强团结。
    通过群众性的谈心活动和一系列的思想政治工作，西安公路学院的革命师生很快提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，挖出了一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他阶级敌人，揭发了他们挑动群众斗群众的罪行，实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。工人宣传队的同志从实践中体会到：开展谈心活动好处很多：通过谈心活动，可以直接把毛主席的指示送到师生们的心坎上，讲得深，落得实，是贯彻执行毛主席指示，对学院实行无产阶级政治领导，向革命师生进行思想教育的好形式；彼此谈心、交心，你一言，我一语，能摸到心窝里的话，能触到痛痒处，能做到一把钥匙开一把锁，大家越谈越近，越谈越亲，是增强团结的好途径；谈得清，问得细，是调查研究的好方法。
