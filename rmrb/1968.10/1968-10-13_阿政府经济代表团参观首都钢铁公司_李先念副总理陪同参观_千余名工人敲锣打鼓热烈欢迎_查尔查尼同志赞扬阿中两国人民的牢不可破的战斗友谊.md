An economic delegation from the Albanian government, led by Adil Charchani, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Vice Premier of the Council of Ministers, visited the Capital Steel Company this morning. The delegation was accompanied by Li Xiannian, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council.

More than a thousand workers at the Capital Steel Company enthusiastically welcomed the Albanian comrades by beating drums and gongs, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, and portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people. They waved the national flags of both countries and lined the streets in celebration.

The Albanian comrades listened to a report by a responsible person from the revolutionary committee of the Capital Steel Company on the situation of the workers in the entire company studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and promoting both revolution and production. They also visited the iron smelting, steel smelting, rolling, and coking plants.

In his remarks after the visit, Adil Charchani highly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. He commended the achievements of the workers of the Capital Steel Company in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and in promoting both revolution and production. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has smashed the plots of China's Khrushchev and his running dogs and agents to restore capitalism, as well as the plots of imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionists. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ensures that the great People's Republic of China will always be a red China. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, sets a brilliant example for other Marxist-Leninist parties. In speaking of Sino-Albanian friendship, he said, "Our friendship was forged in the struggle against our common enemies, imperialism and revisionism. It is a friendship of the people, comrades, friends, and comrades-in-arms. Our friendship is eternal because we are working and fighting for a common ideal, as the great leader Chairman Mao has said: 'No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together.'"

Adil Charchani also said, "The Albanian people, as always, sincerely congratulate the brotherly Chinese people on their great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Labor Party, the Albanian people will forever hold high the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, stand firm on the Adriatic coast, and fulfill their international duty in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism."

Members of the Albanian government economic delegation, including Nataneli, the Albanian Ambassador to China, also visited the Capital Steel Company.

Relevant Chinese officials, including Xie Huai and Ye Zhiqiang, accompanied the Albanian guests during the visit.

    首都钢铁公司的一千多工人，高举中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的画像，高举阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的画像，挥动着中、阿两国国旗，敲锣打鼓，夹道热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友。
    阿尔巴尼亚战友听取了首都钢铁公司革命委员会负责人介绍全公司工人活学活用毛主席著作和抓革命、促生产的情况，并参观了炼铁、炼钢、轧钢和焦化等工厂。
    阿迪尔·查尔查尼同志在参观后的谈话中，高度赞扬了毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，称赞首都钢铁公司工人努力落实毛主席一系列最新指示和在抓革命、促生产中取得的成绩。他说，由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其走狗和代理人妄图复辟资本主义的阴谋诡计，也粉碎了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和以苏修为首的现代修正主义的阴谋诡计。无产阶级文化大革命的这个胜利，使伟大的人民中国永远是红色的中国。由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，给其他马克思列宁主义政党作出了光辉的榜样。他在谈到中阿友谊时说，我们的友谊是在反对我们共同的敌人帝国主义和修正主义的斗争中结成的，是人民、同志、朋友、战友的友谊。我们的友谊是永恒的，因为我们为了一个共同的理想而工作着、战斗着，正如伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    阿迪尔·查尔查尼同志又说，阿尔巴尼亚人民一如既往地、衷心地祝贺兄弟的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的伟大胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的领导下，将永远高举战无不胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜，屹立在亚得里亚海岸，在反对帝国主义和修正主义的斗争中，完成它应尽的国际义务。
