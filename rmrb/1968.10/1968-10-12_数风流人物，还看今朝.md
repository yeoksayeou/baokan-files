Here, we pose a question for our readers to ponder: Why is it that those ordinary "common people" who are looked down upon by some, who have less education, and who work and live under poorer conditions, are often more brilliant than some "experts," "authorities," and "professors," creating countless miracles in the world?

"The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish."

These ordinary "common people" are not famous and have no burdens; they have little education and no rigid frameworks, so they dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. They fear neither heaven nor earth, nor ghosts nor gods. They are not afraid of failure or setbacks and press forward courageously, with nothing to bind their hands and feet. They walk the path of revolution. On the other hand, those "experts," "authorities," and "professors" are afraid of everything, burdened by countless frameworks. They fear losing their "authority" and "face," so they are the most timid and conservative. They walk the path of crawling and servitude.

These ordinary "common people" are laborers and practitioners. The wisest and most talented are those with the most practical experience. They have fought on the front lines of production struggles, class struggles, and scientific experiments for years, accumulating a wealth of experience and knowledge. Much of this experience and knowledge cannot be found in books; it is scientific theory that they have discovered through practice and thus can be applied. They use this experience and knowledge to solve specific problems in production practice, pooling their wisdom and strength, and thus are bound to make inventions and creations! Those "experts," "authorities," and "professors," however, do not labor or practice, so they lack practical experience. Although they may have a lot of "knowledge" and "learning," their theories are detached from reality and cannot solve practical problems. They are detached from production practice and from the working masses who are rich in practical experience, blind and deaf, shut up in their rooms, thinking of grand ideas, but in reality, they are building castles in the air. Therefore, what they produce is detached from production reality and useless.

The reason these ordinary "common people" can make inventions and creations is even more important because they have noble qualities, lofty ideals, and grand goals. They do not seek fame or wealth but dedicate themselves to the cause of socialism. They see their inventions and creations as contributions to the communist cause and as a struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Thus, as Chairman Mao teaches: "As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they do not evade problems but solve them actively, any difficulty in the world can be overcome." In contrast, those "experts," "authorities," and "professors" are deeply influenced by old ideas and habits, and some are blinded by fame and wealth. Their souls are often very filthy.

The most fundamental reason these ordinary "common people" can make inventions and creations is that they have grasped the invincible key to the treasure house of science—Mao Zedong Thought.

Spiritual power can definitely be transformed into tremendous material power. As Vice Chairman Lin points out: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become an endless force, an invincible spiritual atomic bomb." This spiritual atomic bomb is something that "experts," "authorities," and "professors" cannot match or possess. It is a unique spiritual wealth of the millions of ordinary "common people." It is the spiritual power and source of all creations and inventions.

Look! In Tianjin Iron and Steel Plant, the worker Qi Xiuhong, who only knows a few characters, created a new Chinese-style hot-dip aluminum-titanium steel strip technology and process.

In Tianjin Red Guard Canned Food Factory, eight workers who deal with sugar, oil, and flour—"rough and tough" workers—successfully installed the first automated production line for irregular-shaped canned beef in China.

The workers of Tianjin Dry Battery Factory, after just one month and five days, successfully developed a new type of advanced battery, filling a gap in China's chemical power sources.

There are countless such examples.

The remarkable achievements of these ordinary "common people," who are looked down upon by some, vividly demonstrate the mighty power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

"The masses are the true heroes." The creative power of the masses is boundless; the masses are the masters of science and technology. Throughout history, all scientific and technological achievements have been created by workers, peasants, and other laboring people. However, for a long period, the bourgeoisie turned the creations and inventions of workers and peasants into their own. The Chinese Khrushchev also defamed workers and peasants. This inverted history must now be completely reversed.

We are not denying all intellectuals. However, for them to make inventions and creations, they must resolutely carry out the recent order of our great leader Chairman Mao: "...under the leadership of the correct line, workers, peasants, and soldiers must re-educate them, thoroughly changing their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao has pointed out the path forward for intellectuals and placed his hopes in them. Intellectuals must, with a sense of urgency, sincerely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go among workers, peasants, and soldiers, humbly become their students, tightly rely on workers, peasants, and soldiers, honestly accept the leadership of the working class, and accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, fundamentally changing their worldview. Only then can they gradually grasp Mao Zedong Thought, gradually unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and continuously advance on the path of revolutionization and laborization, making contributions to the socialist construction of our country and to the world revolution.

"Counting the heroes of today." The millions of workers and peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the natural masters of the scientific and technological front, the main force in scaling the heights of science and technology, and the giants who dominate human history.

    数风流人物，还看今朝

    在这里，我们向读者提出一个值得人们深思的问题：为什么那些被某些人瞧不起的、读书少的、工作和生活条件比较差的普通“老百姓”，比起一些“名家”、“权威”、“教授”要高明得多，创造了许许多多的人间奇迹呢？
    “卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。
    这些普通“老百姓”，不出名，没有包袱；读书少，没有条条框框，敢想，敢说，敢做，天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，神不怕，不怕失败，不怕曲折，勇往直前，没有什么东西可以束缚住他们的手脚。他们走的是革命的道路。而那些“名家”、“权威”、“教授”，却是前怕虎、后怕狼，条条框框一大堆，出名背包袱，怕失掉“权威”、“面子”，所以最怕事，最保守。他们走的是爬行主义、奴隶主义的道路。
    这些普通“老百姓”，是劳动者，是实践者。最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。他们长年累月战斗在生产斗争、阶级斗争、科学实验的第一线，积累了极其丰富的经验和知识，这些经验和知识，许多是书本上找不到的科学理论，这些经验和知识是他们自己在实践中摸索出来的，因而是用得上的。他们用这些经验和知识去解决在生产实践中所遇到的具体问题，群策群力，就必定会有所发明，有所创造！而那些“名家”、“权威”、“教授”，他们不劳动、不实践，最没有实际经验。尽管他们也有不少的“学问”、“知识”，但是，理论脱离实际，不能解决实际问题；他们既脱离生产实践，又脱离最富有实践经验的工农大众，眼瞎耳聋，关在房子里，想的天花乱坠，实际是闭门造车。因而，搞出来的东西，是脱离生产实际的，用不上的。
    这些普通“老百姓”，所以有所发明，有所创造，更重要的，还在于他们有高贵的品质，崇高的理想，远大的目标，一不为名，二不为利，一心只为社会主义事业。他们把自己的创造、发明，看成是为共产主义事业贡献一份力量，是和帝、修、反的斗争。这样，正如毛主席所教导的：“只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”对比那些“名家”、“权威”、“教授”来说，他们受旧的思想、旧的习惯影响很深，有些人被名和利迷了心窍。他们的灵魂常常是很肮脏的。
    这些普通“老百姓”，他们有所发明、有所创造，最最根本的一条，是他们掌握了打开科学宝库的战无不胜的毛泽东思想这一把金钥匙。
    精神力量是一定能变为巨大的物质力量的。正如林副主席所指出的：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”这个精神原子弹是“名家”、“权威”、“教授”所不能与之较量的、所缺少的，是千百万普通“老百姓”所特有的精神财富。它是一切创造发明的精神力量和源泉。
    请看！天津轧钢一厂只识得几个字的老工人齐秀荣，创造了中国式的热镀铝钛钢带的世界新工艺、新技术。
    天津红卫兵罐头厂八个和糖、油、面打交道的工人“大老粗”，成功地安装了我国第一台自动化的生产异形碎牛肉罐头机器的设备。
    天津干电池厂的工人同志们，只经过了一个月零五天的时间，就试制成功了具有先进水平的新型蓄电池，为我国化学电源填补了空白点。
    这样的例子成千成万。
    象这些被某些人瞧不起的普通“老百姓”的动人创举，正显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力。
    “群众是真正的英雄”。群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，群众是科学技术的主人。自古以来，世界上一切科学技术本来就是工人、农民和其他劳动人民创造的。然而，在很长的历史时期内，资产阶级把工农的创造发明变为他们的，中国赫鲁晓夫也对工农横加污蔑。这个被颠倒了的历史，今天必须全部重新颠倒过来。
    我们并不是全盘否定一切知识分子。但是他们要有所发明，有所创造，必须坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席最近发出的号令：“……要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席给知识分子指出了前进的道路，并寄予希望。知识分子要决心以只争朝夕的精神，切切实实地遵循毛主席的教导，到工农兵中去，甘当工农兵的小学生，紧紧地依靠工农兵，老老实实地接受工人阶级的领导，接受工农兵的再教育，使世界观来一个根本的转变。这样，才能逐步掌握毛泽东思想，逐步地同工农兵结合，在革命化、劳动化的道路上，不断前进，从而为我国的社会主义建设事业、为世界革命做出贡献。
    “数风流人物，还看今朝。”千百万用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农群众就是占领科学技术阵地的当然主人，是攀登科学技术高峰的主力军，是主宰人类历史的巨人。
