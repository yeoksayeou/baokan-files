The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the Handan Ceramics Branch Company has enthusiastically assisted the Revolutionary Committee in starting from ideological education, using revolutionary criticism and self-criticism as the driving force, organizing a large number of cadre personnel to go down to the grassroots for labor. This has effectively promoted the revolutionization of the organization and the ideological revolutionization of the cadres, establishing a relationship of mutual dependence between the cadres and the masses, and promoting the comprehensive advancement of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

When the Revolutionary Committee of the Handan Ceramics Branch Company was first established, due to the influence of the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, the superstructure that did not conform to the socialist economic base was not thoroughly reformed. The institutions under the Revolutionary Committee remained large. Some cadre personnel still sat in offices listening to reports, detached from the masses. Revolutionary masses sharply criticized, saying: "The old ideas, old styles, and old working methods of cadre personnel detached from production labor should be thoroughly changed."

In response to this situation, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Branch Company, together with the members of the Revolutionary Committee, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the necessity of cadres participating in collective production labor. Through the study, everyone's understanding was raised. Then, a meeting of the Revolutionary Committee with the participation of worker representatives was held to discuss the issue of cadre personnel going down to the grassroots for labor, making a plan and formulating measures.

However, there were still many active thoughts among the cadres. Some cadres thought that going down to the grassroots was not glorious; some were afraid of hard work and did not want to do it; and a few cadres who had been criticized by the masses during the Cultural Revolution wanted to drop their responsibilities and become "carefree" by going down to the grassroots for labor, etc. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Branch Company, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles," assisted the Revolutionary Committee in starting from ideological education, using revolutionary criticism and self-criticism as the driving force, and established cadre Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the participation of worker masses. They extensively mobilized the worker masses to use Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate the cadre personnel, and together with them to criticize and repudiate the private and revisionist lines of Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the company, and to discuss the political significance of cadre personnel going down to the grassroots for labor. Through study, discussion, reminiscence, and comparison, everyone unanimously recognized that: cadre personnel going down to the grassroots for labor is the fundamental guarantee for cadres to never detach from the masses and for the proletarian revolutionary power to deeply root in the masses; it is an important way to better implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and fully carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions; it is a strategic measure to overcome bureaucratism and prevent revisionism and dogmatism; it is a powerful driving force for the revolutionization of the organization and the ideological revolutionization of the cadres. Many cadres said: "In the past, we were blinded by the 'private' character, could not put down the cadre's posture, and could not get out of the office. Continuing like this is very dangerous. We must break with the private and establish the public, learn from the working class in the process of going down to the grassroots for labor, and promote ideological revolutionization, forever following Chairman Mao to make the revolution!" Everyone unanimously expressed that they would act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, go to the units where the revolution is most needed, go to the most difficult places, restart learning, reform their thoughts, and thoroughly revolutionize their spiritual outlook.

Material turns into spirit, and spirit turns into material. The cadre personnel of the Handan Ceramics Branch Company went down to the production front line, working side by side with the masses, sweating together, and exerting efforts together, which was warmly welcomed by the worker masses. While working, the cadres vigorously grasped class struggle, listened to heart-to-heart talks at any time, grasped active thoughts at any time, discovered new problems at any time, and effectively promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

    加强思想教育组织机关干部下放劳动
    解放军驻邯郸陶瓷分公司毛泽东思想宣传队帮助革委会，狠抓干部活思想，以革命大批判为动力，促进了干部思想革命化和机关革命化
    本报讯　解放军某部驻邯郸陶瓷分公司毛泽东思想宣传队，热情帮助分公司革命委员会从思想教育入手，以革命大批判为动力，组织大批机关干部下放劳动，有力地促进了机关革命化和干部思想革命化，使干部和群众建立了鱼水相依的关系，推动了斗、批、改的全面开展。
    邯郸陶瓷分公司革委会刚成立时，由于受中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的影响，没有彻底改革不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，革委会所属机构仍然庞大。有些机关干部仍然坐办公室听汇报，脱离群众。革命群众尖锐地批评说：“机关干部脱离生产劳动的旧思想、旧作风、旧工作方法，应该来一个彻底的改变。”
    针对这种情况，驻分公司毛泽东思想宣传队和革命委员会成员一起学习了毛主席关于必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的教导。通过学习，提高了大家的认识。然后又召开有工人代表参加的革委会扩大会议，研究机关干部下放劳动问题，作出了规划，订出了措施。
    但是，干部中还有许多活思想。有的干部认为下放不光采；有的怕劳累不愿干；还有个别干部在文化大革命中受了群众的批判，想撂下挑子，下放劳动当个“逍遥派”，等等。驻分公司毛泽东思想宣传队遵循毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，帮助革委会从思想教育入手，以革命大批判为动力，办起了有工人群众参加的干部毛泽东思想学习班。广泛地发动工人群众用毛泽东思想给机关干部以再教育，和他们一起斗私批修，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫和分公司党内一小撮走资派推行反革命修正主义路线的罪行，大谈干部下放劳动的政治意义。通过学习、讨论、回忆、对比，大家一致认识到：干部下放劳动是使干部永远不脱离群众，使无产阶级革命政权深深扎根于群众之中的根本保证，是更好地贯彻毛主席革命路线，全面落实毛主席最新指示的重要途径；是克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义的战略措施；是实现机关革命化、干部思想革命化的强大动力。不少干部说：“过去我们被‘私’字迷住了心窍，放不下干部架子，跳不出机关办公室，这样继续下去是很危险的，我们一定要破私立公，在下放劳动的过程中向工人阶级学习，促进思想革命化，永远紧跟毛主席干革命！”大家一致表示要按照毛主席的指示办事，到革命最需要的单位去，到最艰苦的地方去，重新学习，改造思想，使自己的精神面貌来一个彻底的革命化。
    物质变精神，精神变物质。邯郸陶瓷分公司机关干部下放到生产第一线，和群众贴着身子干，汗往一处流，劲往一处使，受到了工人群众的热烈欢迎。干部们一面劳动，一面狠抓阶级斗争，随时听到知心话，随时抓活思想，随时发现新问题，有力地推动了斗、批、改。
