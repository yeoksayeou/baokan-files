	The citizens of Northern Ireland have been continuously holding large-scale protests to demand civil rights and oppose government suppression. On the 9th, three thousand students from Queen's University in Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, took to the streets to protest the brutal suppression of the people who were demonstrating for civil rights in Derry on the 5th.

	Many of the protesting students wore badges condemning the fascist atrocities of the Northern Ireland authorities and chanted slogans denouncing the police who suppressed the demonstrators as Hitler's ruthless secret police.

	This was the largest student protest in Belfast since the end of World War II. The students rushed out of the school gates and headed towards the City Hall, but were stopped by the police on the way. The students then held a sit-in protest on the streets for several hours.

	On the 5th, the Northern Ireland authorities brutally suppressed the demonstrators in Derry, the second-largest city in Northern Ireland. However, the people of Northern Ireland were not intimidated and continued their struggle. Since the 5th, the people of Derry and Belfast have been continuously taking various forms of action to resist or protest against the police violence, such as setting fire to police training centers, throwing homemade Molotov cocktails and stones at police cars, and gathering on the streets to hold protest demonstrations.

	The struggle of the people of Northern Ireland has made the rulers nervous. The head of the Northern Ireland authorities, O'Neill, hurriedly cut short his visit to England and returned to Belfast to plan measures to suppress the people. It is reported that the Northern Ireland Home Secretary has arbitrarily banned the large-scale demonstration that the people had planned to hold in Derry on the 12th.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in London, on the 5th, more than 1,500 people in Londonderry, the second-largest city in Northern Ireland, held a demonstration to demand civil rights. People also built barricades to resist the police who came to suppress them. The struggle continued on the 6th.

	On the 6th, more than a thousand people in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, continued to hold demonstrations, protesting against the reactionary authorities' dispatch of a large number of police to suppress the demonstrators on the 5th.

    争取公民权利　反对当局镇压
    北爱尔兰群众连续举行大规模示威
    贝尔法斯特三千学生上街游行，示威规模为战后以来所未有
    新华社伦敦十日电  英国北爱尔兰首府贝尔法斯特女王大学的三千名学生，九日在贝尔法斯特举行示威，抗议当局残酷镇压五日在德里为争取公民权利而进行示威斗争的人民群众。
    许多示威学生佩戴着谴责北爱尔兰当局法西斯暴行的徽章，并且高呼口号，痛斥镇压示威群众的警察是杀人不眨眼的希特勒的秘密警察。
    这是第二次世界大战以后贝尔法斯特规模最大的一次学生示威。学生们冲出校门，前往市政厅，但中途被警察拦住，学生们就在大街上举行了好几个小时的静坐示威。
    北爱尔兰当局五日对北爱尔兰第二大城市德里的示威群众进行了残酷的镇压，但是北爱尔兰人民不畏强暴，坚持斗争。从五日以来，德里和贝尔法斯特的人民群众不断采取各种斗争形式抗击或抗议警察暴行，如放火焚烧警察训练中心，向来犯警车投掷自制燃烧瓶和石头，在街头聚集起来举行抗议示威。
    北爱尔兰人民的奋起斗争使得统治者感到惶恐。北爱尔兰当局的头子奥尼尔慌忙中断他在英格兰的访问，赶回贝尔法斯特策划镇压人民的措施。据报道，北爱尔兰内政大臣已经蛮横地禁止人民群众原订十二日在德里举行的另一次大规模示威。
    据新华社伦敦电　在英国北爱尔兰的第二大城市伦敦德里，五日有一千五百多人举行争取公民权利的示威，人们还筑起街垒，抗击前去镇压的警察。六日斗争仍在继续中。
    英国北爱尔兰伦敦德里市千余名群众六日继续举行示威，抗议反动当局五日派出大批警察镇压示威者的暴行。
