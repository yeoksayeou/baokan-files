The Dazhai Brigade Overcomes Severe Disasters and Achieves a Bumper Harvest

During the struggle against disasters, the broad masses of community members have better studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of thought; everyone has come up with ideas and wisdom, fully demonstrating the tremendous superiority of the socialist collective economy.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 16th — Recently, the Dazhai Brigade of Dazhai Commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, has once again sent good news: the broad masses of community members and cadres, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have overcome an unprecedented severe hail disaster, making this year another good year. Currently, community members are harvesting autumn crops. Forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production have also developed significantly.

In 1967, the Dazhai Brigade achieved double victories in revolution and production. The broad masses of community members and cadres are determined to make the revolution even better in 1968, raising the level of thought revolutionization to a new height, and promoting the further comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production.

Since last winter, the Dazhai Brigade has closely combined the revolutionary and production tasks of each period, continuously holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have used the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions as weapons, and the more than ten years of class struggle, two-line struggle practice in Dazhai as a living textbook, to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. They have combined the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness, further raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of community members.

With new thoughts and new styles, production has added new strength. This year, the Dazhai Brigade has a large spring plowing production task, fewer laborers, shorter time, and more difficulties. However, the broad masses of community members, with deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have worked in the fields with great enthusiasm. During the more than fifty days of intense spring plowing and sowing, no community member was absent or asked for leave. Everyone went out early and returned late, competing to take on heavy tasks. As a result, they completed the spring sowing task ahead of schedule and to high standards, winning the first battle of production this year.

Just as various autumn crops were growing lushly, a severe hail disaster struck in the afternoon of July 6th. Egg-sized hailstones fell for more than ten minutes, stripping the leaves off the corn, breaking some stalks, and knocking down the sorghum. At the time, comrades who came to Dazhai for inspection and visits saw this scene and were worried for the people of Dazhai.

A new severe test was placed before the people of Dazhai. At this time, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin showed great concern for Dazhai, sending comrades from the People's Liberation Army to bring the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to Dazhai, adding new strength to the anti-disaster struggle. Various leading organs and the broad revolutionary masses also sent condolence teams, wrote letters, and sent telegrams, encouraging and supporting the people of Dazhai.

Under the warm care of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and with the strong support and encouragement of the people of the whole country, the heroic people of Dazhai, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a magnificent anti-disaster struggle. Brigade Party Branch Secretary Chen Yonggui convened successive Party branch meetings, cadre meetings, and community member meetings, mobilizing and organizing the community member masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the question of how to deal with this hail disaster. Chen Yonggui said: Natural disasters are not frightening. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can turn bad things into good things. The broad masses of community members reviewed and summarized Dazhai's more than ten years of struggle against nature. Everyone unanimously recognized that Dazhai has had disasters every year for ten years, facing disasters every year and overcoming them every year. Overcoming disasters can help people better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of thought; overcoming disasters can make people think of ways and show wisdom, tempering people's will and increasing people's abilities; it can fully mobilize collective strength, demonstrating the tremendous superiority of the socialist collective economy. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Yangtze River, everyone says it is very big, but actually, big is not frightening. Isn't American imperialism very big? We have fought against it and it is nothing. Therefore, some big things in the world are actually not frightening." We should treat natural disasters in the same way: first, do not be afraid; second, persist in the struggle. The greater the disaster, the higher our morale; the heavier the disaster, the harder our resolve; the more disasters, the more ways we have.

The broad masses of community members have firmly established their confidence and determination to fight against the hail disaster, continuing to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, with an overwhelming heroic spirit, launching a "people's war" to overcome the hail disaster. Regardless of gender or age, day or night, everyone worked as if two people, doing the work of two people. From seventy- or eighty-year-old elders to seven- or eight-year-old children, everyone took part.

The more than twenty members of the Iron Girls Brigade fought day and night, covered in water and mud, never complaining or feeling tired. Some elderly people advised them to rest for a while, but they replied: Fighting against natural disasters is like fighting against class enemies, we must seize every second and not give up an inch of land. Saving one more seedling, planting one more seedling, harvesting one more pound of grain, is a token of loyalty to Chairman Mao, a contribution to the Cultural Revolution, and a bullet shot at the Chinese Khrushchev. The brigade cadres also worked day and night with the masses, setting a good example. Deputy Party Branch Secretary Liang Bianliang led a group of young people, planting seedlings in front and watering behind, fighting in the fields for four or five consecutive nights without going back to rest. The broad masses of community members, while fighting against the disaster, also criticized the Chinese Khrushchev with pen and tongue. The revolutionary criticism further promoted the anti-disaster struggle. The people of Dazhai, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, quickly overcame the hail disaster. The victory of the people of Dazhai once again demonstrated the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, once again demonstrating that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人无往而不胜
    大寨大队战胜严重灾害获得好收成
    在抗灾斗争中，广大社员更好地活学活用毛主席著作，促进思想革命化；人人想办法，出智慧，充分发挥了社会主义集体经济的巨大优越性
    新华社太原十六日电　山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队最近又传出喜讯：广大社员和干部以毛泽东思想为武器，战胜了从来没有见过的严重冰雹灾害，今年又是一个好年景。目前，社员们正在收割大秋作物。林业、牧业、副业生产也有较大的发展。
    一九六七年，大寨大队的革命和生产获得了双胜利。广大社员和干部决心在一九六八年把革命搞得更好，把人的思想革命化提高到一个更新的水平，促进农、林、牧、副业生产进一步全面发展。
    从去年冬天以来，大寨大队紧密结合各个时期的革命和生产任务，持续不断地大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。他们以“老三篇”和毛主席的一系列最新指示为武器，以大寨十多年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争实践为活教材，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把批修和斗私结合起来，进一步提高了广大社员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    人人有了新思想、新作风，生产上就增添了新力量。今年大寨大队的春耕生产任务大，劳力少，时间短，困难多，但是广大社员带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，带着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱去种田，浑身是劲。在紧张的五十多天春耕播种时间里，没有一个社员缺勤、请假，大伙早出晚归，争挑重担子。结果，提前高标准地完成了春播任务，打胜了今年生产第一仗。
    正当各种大秋作物茂盛地生长的时候，七月六日下午一场特大的冰雹灾害降临了。鸡蛋大的冰雹一连下了十几分钟，玉米的叶子被打光了，有的秆子被打断了，谷子被打倒了。当时到大寨参观访问的同志看到这种情景，都替大寨人担心。
    一场新的严峻的考验摆在大寨人面前。这时，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部非常关心大寨，派来了亲人解放军，给大寨带来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，增添了抗灾斗争的生力军。各地领导机关和广大革命群众也纷纷派慰问团、写信和打电报，给大寨人以鼓舞和支持。
    在毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，在全国人民的大力支持和鼓舞下，英雄的大寨人高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开展了一场轰轰烈烈的抗灾斗争。大队党支部书记陈永贵同志接连召开党支部会、干部会、社员会，广泛发动和组织社员群众带着如何对待这场冰雹灾害的问题，活学活用毛主席著作。陈永贵同志说：自然灾害并不可怕。有了毛泽东思想就能使坏事变好事。广大社员回顾和总结了大寨十多年来同大自然搏斗的战斗历程。大家一致认识到：大寨十年就有十年自然灾害，年年有灾，年年抗灾，抗一个胜一个。抗灾，可以使人们更好地活学活用毛主席著作，促进思想革命化；抗灾，可以使人们想办法，出智慧，磨炼人的意志，增长人的才干；可以充分调动集体的力量，发挥社会主义集体经济的巨大优越性。广大贫下中农说，毛主席教导我们：“长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。”我们对待自然灾害也是这样，第一，不怕；第二，坚持斗争。灾害越大，我们的志气越高；灾害越重，我们的骨头越硬；灾害越多，我们的办法越多。
    广大社员坚定了大战雹灾的信心和决心，继续发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，以压倒一切的英雄气概，开展了一场战胜雹灾的“人民战争”。人不分男女老幼，天不分昼夜早晚，一天顶两天干，一人顶两人用。从七八十岁的老人到七八岁的娃娃，人人上阵。
    铁姑娘队的二十多个队员昼夜连续作战，满身是水和泥，从不叫苦叫累。一些老年人劝她们休息一会儿，她们回答说：和自然灾害斗，和同阶级敌人斗一样，要争分夺秒，寸步不让，寸土必争。多保一棵苗，多栽一棵苗，多打一斤粮，就是献给毛主席的一分忠心，就是对文化大革命的一分贡献，就是射向中国赫鲁晓夫的一颗子弹。大队的干部也不分昼夜和群众奋战在一起，给社员们树立了好榜样。党支部副书记梁便良带领一伙青年，前头栽苗，后头浇水，连续四五个夜晚奋战在田间，不回去休息。广大社员一面抗灾，一面口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫。革命的大批判，又有力地推动了抗灾斗争。大寨人就是这样，在解放军的帮助下，迅速战胜了雹灾。大寨人的这一胜利，再一次显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无比威力，再一次显示了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人无往而不胜。
