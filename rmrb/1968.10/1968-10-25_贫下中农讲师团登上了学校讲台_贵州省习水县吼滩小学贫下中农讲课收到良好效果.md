Houtan Primary School is a rural school located in a mountainous area. Thirty-three years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao, along with the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, passed through here twice, sowing the seeds of revolution. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Houtan, rich in revolutionary traditions, seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and occupied the educational front. They also exposed, denounced, and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev.

In March of this year, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Houtan Commune selected their outstanding representatives to join the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" of the Houtan Primary School Revolutionary Committee. On the very day the school's Revolutionary Committee was established, a team of six poor and lower-middle peasants formed a "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" and boldly stepped onto the stage, thus ending the monopoly of the bourgeois intellectuals over teaching.

The establishment of the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" was not without its difficulties and twists. The class enemy secretly sabotaged, and old habits and forces constantly interfered. Against these, the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight back. Someone spread the rumor: "The poor and lower-middle peasants can only work, they can't teach." They countered with Chairman Mao's words: "The most intelligent and the most capable are those who have the most practical experience!" Someone sneered: "At your age, you're still running around with the kids." They retorted: "If we don't cultivate good successors, people will change, the country will change color, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer again!"

The "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" is composed of active learners of Chairman Mao's works, experienced old poor peasants, pioneers in scientific experiments, model breeders, demobilized and retired revolutionary soldiers, and core members of the revolutionary rebels. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants strongly support the "Lecturer Team" and continuously send their outstanding representatives to join the team. The team has grown to thirteen members.

The "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" is non-full-time. The labor time they miss due to teaching is recorded by the production team. They regularly go to the school to teach, at least one class per week. Whether teaching students to read, work, farm, or military affairs, or criticizing the bourgeoisie, these poor and lower-middle peasant lecturers are true authorities. They teach courses on Mao Zedong Thought and class struggle, mainly based on Chairman Mao's instructions, the actual class struggle in the local area, and the living thoughts of the school's teachers and students. For example, during the "resume classes and make revolution" period, the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" taught lessons such as "Why don't I have culture?" "How did we get our happy life today?" and "Without Chairman Mao, there would be no happiness for the people of Houtan." Their recollections and comparisons, bitter memories and sweet thoughts, educated the revolutionary teachers and students, raised their class consciousness, and thus improved the school's "resume classes and make revolution." In the struggle against the enemy, the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" taught in front of the Red Army martyrs' tomb, recounting the heroic deeds of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army when they passed through Houtan, and angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of the local tyrants and evil gentry who killed the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The revolutionary teachers and students, after listening to the lessons, harbored deep hatred for the class enemies and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, visited old farmers, investigated clues, and uncovered three class enemies who had killed Red Army soldiers. To carry out the activity of thrift in running the school, the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" sent a militia platoon leader who had visited Dazhai to teach, inspiring the revolutionary teachers and students with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Dazhai people to change the world, and immediately engaging in the labor of building the school. The agricultural technology courses are mainly taught on-site according to different seasonal farm work; they also lead the revolutionary teachers and students to plant experimental fields, improve soil, and cultivate superior varieties.

The broad revolutionary teachers and students have a very good response to the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team's" teaching. They summarized five advantages: First, the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" is composed of outstanding representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, who love our great leader Chairman Mao the most, study Mao Zedong Thought well, and can cultivate students' healthy growth with proletarian feelings, which is beneficial to cultivating successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Second, the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" taking the school stage has broken the rule of the bourgeois intellectuals over the school, fundamentally changing the situation where teaching is separated from politics, separated from workers and peasants, and separated from labor; it can effectively help revolutionary teachers and students establish feelings for workers and peasants and transform non-proletarian thoughts. Third, theory is combined with practice, learning is applied, learning is deep, application is effective, and memory is firm, enabling students to obtain rich practical knowledge and learn many living knowledge that cannot be learned from books. Fourth, the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" teaches without the old habit of "respect for teachers," fully mobilizing students' initiative and creativity in learning. Fifth, the "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Lecturer Team" teaches with rich content and flexible methods, making the school's teaching work unprecedentedly lively.

    贫下中农讲师团登上了学校讲台
    贵州省习水县吼滩小学贫下中农讲课收到良好效果
    吼滩小学是一所农村小学，地处山区。三十三年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席率领的中国工农红军两次经过这里，播下了革命的火种。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，富有革命传统的吼滩贫下中农，在向党内一小撮走资派夺权的同时，占领了教育阵地，并且对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线进行了大揭露、大控诉、大批判。
    今年三月，在毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，吼滩公社贫下中农推选自己的优秀代表，参加了吼滩小学革委会的革命“三结合”。就在学校成立革委会的当天，由六位贫下中农组成了一个“贫下中农讲师团”，大踏步地登上了讲台，从此结束了资产阶级知识分子垄断教课的现象。
    “贫下中农讲师团”的成立，经过了不少的艰难曲折。阶级敌人暗中捣鬼，旧习惯势力不断干扰。对于这些，“贫下中农讲师团”以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，进行了针锋相对的斗争。有人散布说：“贫下中农只能干活，不能讲课。”他们就背诵毛主席语录：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”！有人讥讽说：“几十岁了，还跟着娃儿跑。”他们反驳道：“不培养好接班人，人要变质，国要变色，我们贫下中农就要吃二遍苦！”
    “贫下中农讲师团”由活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子，富有阶级斗争经验的老贫农，科学实验的闯将，模范饲养员，复员、退伍回乡的革命军人，革命造反派骨干组成。广大贫下中农非常支持“讲师团”，不断把自己的优秀代表送进“讲师团”。“讲师团”的队伍越来越大，现在已经发展到十三人了。
    “贫下中农讲师团”是不脱产的，他们因讲课而耽误的劳动时间由生产队记工分。他们定期到学校讲课，一星期至少一节。不论教学生学文、学工、学农、学军、批判资产阶级，这些贫下中农讲师都是真正的权威。他们讲毛泽东思想课，讲阶级斗争课，主要是根据毛主席的教导，和当地的阶级斗争的实际，以及学校师生中的活思想，讲自己的认识和切身的感受。例如，在“复课闹革命”中，“贫下中农讲师团”就讲“我为什么没有文化？”“我们今天的幸福生活是怎样来的？”“没有毛主席就没有吼滩人民的幸福”等等。他们的回忆对比，忆苦思甜，教育了革命师生，提高了他们的阶级觉悟，从而搞好了学校的“复课闹革命”。在对敌斗争中，“贫下中农讲师团”就在红军烈士墓前，讲述工农红军经过吼滩时的英雄气概，愤怒控诉土豪劣绅杀害工农红军的滔天罪行。革命师生听了课，怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，和贫下中农一起，访老农，查线索，挖出了三个杀害红军战士的阶级敌人。为了开展勤俭办学的活动，“贫下中农讲师团”派一个曾经到大寨参观过的民兵连长讲课，激发了广大革命师生学大寨人改天换地的革命豪情，立即投入了建校的劳动。生产技术课，主要是根据不同季节的农活到现场教授；他们还带领革命师生种试验田，改良土壤，培育良种。
    广大革命师生对“贫下中农讲师团”讲课反映很好。他们总结有五大好处：一、“贫下中农讲师团”是由贫下中农的优秀代表所组成，他们对伟大领袖毛主席最热爱，毛泽东思想学得好，能够以无产阶级感情培育学生健康成长，有利于培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。二、“贫下中农讲师团”登上了学校讲台，打破了资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治，从根本上改变了教学脱离政治、脱离工农、脱离劳动的状况；能够有效地帮助革命师生建立工农感情，改造非无产阶级思想。三、理论联系实际，学了就用，学得深，用得上，记得牢，使学生得到了丰富的实践知识，学到了许多书本上学不到的活的知识。四、“贫下中农讲师团”讲课没有“师道尊严”的旧习气，可以充分发挥学生学习的主动性、创造性。五、“贫下中农讲师团”讲课，教学内容丰富，教学方法灵活，使学校教学工作空前活跃。
