The Chinese Khrushchev has long been peddling bourgeois black goods, shouting loudly: “It’s not about being selfless, but about balancing public and private interests, prioritizing public interests first and private interests later.” He shamelessly preaches the philosophy of self-preservation to party members, claiming that “to love oneself for the sake of the party and the revolution is to protect one’s life and health.” Following this reactionary logic, wouldn’t it mean that to “protect one’s life and health,” one could desert in battle or surrender to the enemy? Wouldn’t it mean that to “protect one’s life and health,” one could turn public property into private gain, replacing public interests with private ones? This is the greatest slander against our Communist Party members.

In the face of the needs of the revolutionary cause, the question is whether to “love oneself and protect one’s life and health” or to fight bravely and be willing to sacrifice one’s blood and life. This is the touchstone for distinguishing true Communists from false ones. In May 1967, during a tunnel construction, our company had an explosion. Forty charges were detonated, but after twenty-seven, the first charge, which was supposed to take seven minutes to explode, detonated in just one minute. I was knocked down by flying debris. When I regained consciousness, I immediately realized that in four or five minutes, the remaining twenty-six charges would all explode. At this critical moment, I remembered Chairman Mao’s teaching: “Concern for others should be greater than concern for oneself.” I decided that no matter how the earth and sky might collapse, I would rescue my comrades. At that time, I was injured in the head, dizzy and weak. But Chairman Mao’s teaching, “This army has an indomitable spirit, it will trample down all enemies and never be subdued by them,” gave me boundless strength. I suppressed the pain and dizziness, and crawled into the tunnel. The platoon leader, Li Rongxu, was seriously injured. I exerted all my strength to carry him to a safe place.

At this point, there were only about two minutes left before the other charges would explode. Going back would be dangerous, but I remembered Chairman Mao’s teaching: “To die for the people’s interests is heavier than Mount Tai.” Without hesitation, I shouted, “Determined to fight, unafraid of sacrifice...” and rushed towards the explosion site with comrades Tan Baochang and Tan Xiangxin, who had just regained consciousness. We rescued comrade Wang Xiucheng, who was half-buried under the rubble. When Wang Xiucheng woke up, he shouted, “Run, don’t worry about me!” But none of us thought about our own safety. We used all our strength to move the big stones and carried Wang Xiucheng out. Just as we left the danger zone, we heard the explosions behind us, but we had escaped safely.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Communist Party members must have vitality, must have a firm revolutionary will, must have the spirit of overcoming all difficulties with unyielding determination, and must overcome individualism, parochialism, absolute egalitarianism, and liberalism; otherwise, they are not genuine Communist Party members.” Everything of a proletarian revolutionary, including his life, belongs to the party and the people. We should be vigorous revolutionary fighters, always putting the party’s interests and the people’s interests above our own. We should be like Comrade Lei Feng, dedicating our limited lives to the boundless revolutionary cause, living to struggle for the people’s interests, and dying to dedicate ourselves to the people’s interests. This communist worldview can only be established through continuous self-awareness and transformation of one’s thoughts in the three great revolutionary practices of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, gradually eliminating the “private” self, one step at a time.

The greater the public interest, the less the private interest; the greater the private interest, the less the public interest. If a person’s mind is filled with selfish thoughts, when faced with a situation, they will only think about how to love themselves, act solely for personal gain, be cowardly and afraid of death, and will never struggle for the party’s interests and the people’s interests. They will certainly not be able to contribute their lives to the cause of the proletariat.

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promotes the “fusion of public and private interests” to stifle the revolutionary spirit of Communist Party members and cause them to degenerate. We must, with the spirit of “seizing the day,” thoroughly smash the Chinese Khrushchev’s conspiracy to use bourgeois reactionary worldviews to transform our party members. We must always put the party’s interests first and be selfless and fearless revolutionary fighters.

### 大公则无私　大私则忘公

    大公则无私　大私则忘公
    铁道兵某部副排长　叶乃洪
    中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来极力贩卖资产阶级的黑货，拚命地叫喊：“不是大公无私，而是大公有私，公私兼顾，先公后私”。他并按照这种谬论，恬不知耻地在党员面前宣扬活命哲学，胡说什么：“为了党与革命的利益而钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”。按照这个反动逻辑，岂不是为了“保护自己的生命与健康”可以在战场上当逃兵，在敌人面前变节自首；岂不是为了“保护自己的生命与健康”，可以化公为私，以私代公。这是对我们共产党员最大的污蔑。
    在革命事业的需要面前，是“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”，还是英勇战斗，不惜献出自己的鲜血和生命，这是判别真共产党员还是假共产党员的试金石。一九六七年五月，我们连在隧道施工中，有一次进行爆破，四十炮刚点到二十七炮，突然预计需要七分钟才爆炸的第一炮，只一分钟就意外地爆炸了。我被飞来的乱石冲倒了。当我从昏迷中醒来时，立刻意识到再有四、五分钟，剩下的二十六炮就将全部爆炸。在这关键时刻，我想起了毛主席“关心他人比关心自己为重”的伟大教导。我决心任凭天崩地裂，也要把战友抢救出去。当时我头部负伤，头晕眼花，四肢无力。但毛主席“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的教导，给我增添了无穷无尽的力量。我克制着伤疼头晕，摸到洞里。排长李荣旭受了重伤，我用尽平生力气，把他背到了安全地点。
    这时，离其它炮全部爆炸顶多还有两分钟，再回去就有危险。但我又想起毛主席关于“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导，又毫不迟疑地高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲……”冲向爆炸点，和刚从昏迷中苏醒过来的新战士覃宝昌、覃向新一起，抢救被乱石埋住半截身子的战友王秀臣。王秀臣醒来时，高喊：“你们快跑，不要管我！”可我们谁也没有想到自己的安危，用尽全身力气，把大石搬开，抬起王秀臣就往外冲。刚离开危险区，只听得身后群炮齐鸣，乱石呼啸，而我们却安全脱险了。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员一定要有朝气，一定要有坚强的革命意志，一定要有不怕困难和用百折不挠的意志去克服任何困难的精神，一定要克服个人主义、本位主义、绝对平均主义和自由主义，否则就不是一个名副其实的共产党员。”无产阶级革命者的一切，包括他的生命，都是属于党、属于人民的。我们应当是一个朝气蓬勃的革命战士，永远以党的利益、人民的利益，作为自己的第一生命。我们应当象毛主席的好战士雷锋一样，把有限的生命投入到无限的革命事业中去，活为人民利益而奋斗，死为人民利益而献身。这种共产主义世界观，只能在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命的实践中，不断地自觉地改造思想，一点一滴地斗掉自己的“私”字，才能树立起来。大公则无私，大私则忘公。一个人头脑里有了私字，一事当前，考虑怎样钟爱自己，一定专门利己，贪生怕死，决不能为党的利益、人民的利益去奋斗，更不可能为无产阶级的事业而贡献出自己的生命。
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹“公私溶化论”，目的是扼杀共产党员的无产阶级革命性，使党员蜕化变质。我们一定要用“只争朝夕”的精神，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫用资产阶级反动世界观来改造我们党员的阴谋，永远以党的利益为第一生命，做一个无私无畏的革命战士。
