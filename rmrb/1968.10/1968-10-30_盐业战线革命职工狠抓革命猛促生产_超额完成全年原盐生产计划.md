	Revolutionary workers on the salt industry frontline grasp revolution and promote production, exceeding the annual salt production plan

	By the end of October, the national salt production has increased by nearly 40% compared to the same period last year, providing ample raw materials for the production of salt chemical products.

	Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: Based on the achievement of exceeding the state's salt production task last year, the broad revolutionary workers on the salt industry frontline in our country have, this year, completed the state's salt production plan three and a half months ahead of schedule. By now, the national salt production has increased by nearly 40% compared to the same period last year. The main salt-producing areas such as Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning provinces have seen their salt production increase by 80% and more than double compared to the same period last year, making this year the fastest and best year for completing the salt production task in recent years. Salt fields such as Tanggu, Fuzhou Bay, and Yangjiaogou have all set new historical records for salt production. The significant increase in salt production has provided ample raw materials for the production of salt chemical products.

	Since the beginning of this year, various salt-producing areas, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at various levels and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, have seen Mao Zedong Thought study classes spring up like bamboo after a rain, covering all salt fields. Revolutionary workers have always put learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide and transform everything, which has effectively promoted the ideological revolution of the people and driven the vigorous development of the revolution and production. So far, revolutionary committees have been established in the vast majority of salt fields and salt factories across the country, and a thorough revolutionary criticism and class cleansing campaign has been carried out. In the revolutionary criticism, revolutionary workers have fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, greatly raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and more actively participating in the struggle to grasp the revolution and promote production, achieving a significant increase in salt production. Many salt fields have completed their annual production tasks in just half a year, and the quality has also significantly improved.

	Currently, the broad revolutionary workers on the salt industry frontline across the country are determined, in the great tide of struggle, criticism, and reform, to follow the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao and make greater contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    盐业战线革命职工狠抓革命猛促生产
    超额完成全年原盐生产计划
    到目前为止，全国原盐产量比去年同期增长近百分之四十，为盐化工产品生产提供了充足的原料
    新华社二十九日讯　我国盐业战线广大革命职工，在去年超额完成国家原盐生产任务的基础上，今年又提前三个半月超额完成了国家原盐生产计划。到目前为止，全国原盐产量比去年同期增长近百分之四十。主要海盐产区的河北、山东、辽宁等省的原盐产量分别比去年同期增长百分之八十和一倍以上，是近年来完成原盐生产任务最快、最好的一年。塘沽、复州湾、羊角沟等盐场都创造了盐产量历史新纪录。原盐大幅度的增产，为盐化工产品生产提供了充足的原料。
    今年年初以来，各盐产区在各级革命委员会的领导及人民解放军支左部队的大力支持下，毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍及各盐场。广大革命职工始终把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，坚持用毛泽东思想指导一切，改造一切，有力地促进了人的思想革命化，推动了革命和生产的蓬勃发展。到目前为止，全国绝大多数盐场、盐厂都已建立革命委员会，深入地开展了革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作。在革命的大批判中，广大革命职工狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，更加主动积极地投入了抓革命、促生产的战斗，取得了原盐大幅度增产的胜利。不少盐场仅用半年左右时间，就全面完成了全年生产任务，质量也大大提高。
    当前，全国盐业战线广大革命职工在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，决心沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利做出更大的贡献。
