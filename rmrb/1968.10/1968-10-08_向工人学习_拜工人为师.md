The spring breeze brings joy to the land, and the mountains and rivers of our motherland are red. "The working class must lead everything." With Chairman Mao's great directive, the vast army of industrial workers has marched into the realms of culture, education, and all other superstructures, ushering in a magnificent new wave of struggle, criticism, and reform. At this great moment, we stand by the side of our great leader Chairman Mao, participating in the performance to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and we feel immensely fortunate.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all other work." Reflecting on the birth of the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Harbor," and on our process of learning from the dock workers in Shanghai, we deeply appreciate the wisdom, correctness, and greatness of this directive.

In 1964, following the instructions of Comrade Jiang Qing, we came to the docks of Shanghai Harbor to learn from the workers and take them as our teachers. Upon arriving at the harbor, we were immediately captivated by the magnificent scene. Giant ships lined the Huangpu River, cranes stood tall, and dock workers, with their high spirits of socialist labor, worked day and night loading and unloading cargo. On the docks, we ate, lived, and worked alongside the dock workers. The excellent qualities of the working class, especially their boundless love and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, deeply educated us. When we visited the workers' homes, we saw that each home had a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall by the door. Whenever they talked about the contrast between their lives before and after liberation, the changes in the docks, and their achievements at work, they would always say excitedly, "All this is thanks to Chairman Mao!" "These achievements should be credited to Chairman Mao." The workers' profound class feelings for the great leader deeply moved us and spurred us on.

The workers' love for the great leader is rooted in their class background. In the old society, dock workers were labeled as "laborers" and "stinky little workers" by the exploiting classes, enduring endless oppression and exploitation. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, they were liberated and became the masters of the docks and the country. They never forget the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new. As soon as we arrived at the docks, they gave us lessons in class education, using their own experiences in the old society to tell us the history of the docks and the workers; they took us to the sites where imperialists, capitalists, and contractors used to detain and beat workers, and where workers had fought against the reactionaries with their bamboo poles. Some workers even took off their clothes to show us their scars. Their blood-curdling accounts and heart-rending struggles deeply educated each of us. It is precisely because of this strong love and hate that they are so passionate about "Harbor," especially the scene of class education. Every time the workers watch it, they shout slogans: "Remember the class bitterness, never forget the blood debt!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years!" By learning from the excellent qualities of the working class, our thoughts and feelings gradually changed, laying a solid foundation for us to portray the heroic images of the working class on stage. For example, the actress playing the role of Party Secretary Fang Haizhen initially lacked the thoughts and feelings of a dock worker. Moreover, the reactionary academic "authority" who was then the director made her follow the Party Secretary all day, trying to "understand the role" and "capture the image." As a result, she did not blend in with the broad masses of workers. Later, after learning from Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our literary and artistic workers must complete this task, must shift their stand, must, in the course of deepening their contact with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and deepening their participation in the practical struggle, in the course of learning Marxism and learning about society, gradually shift over to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat," she changed her approach, insisted on immersing herself in life, and blended in with the workers. In the shared struggle, she realized that cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not elevated above the masses but are among the masses. They lead the masses forward and are ordinary members of the masses, serving the people wholeheartedly. Based on this understanding, the Party Secretary Fang Haizhen she portrayed was welcomed by the workers. The dock workers happily said, "Only such a Fang Haizhen is like the Party Secretary of our dock workers."

"Harbor" is a song of praise for the patriotism and internationalism of the working class. Through working and living with the dock workers, we gained a deeper understanding of the sublime qualities of the working class. Shanghai Harbor is one of the main ports for China's foreign trade. Here, through the hands of the dock workers, tens of thousands of tons of goods are shipped to Asia, Africa, and Latin America every day, supporting the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples. What we used to see as ordinary goods are, in the eyes of the dock workers, bullets against imperialism and revisionism, truly "every package and item is connected to the world's winds." Because of this, they work with boundless energy, high spirits, and meticulous care. The dock is often subject to sudden tasks due to weather and other factors. No matter how heavy the tasks are, the workers never complain about difficulties or conditions; they take on as much as they can and do whatever is needed. The dock workers' sublime qualities of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly greatly educated us and provided great inspiration for us to portray the heroic figures of the working class on stage. For example, the actor playing Gao Zhiyang initially had little understanding of the revolutionary spirit of the dock workers and thus did not perform with enough vigor and strength. During the process of working with the dock workers, he once saw the workers, when accepting a sudden task, proudly declare, "Even if the sky falls, we will hold it up!" He remembered that the stage character Gao Zhiyang also had such a line and needed such a spirit, which greatly inspired him. Combined with living and working with the workers and learning from their excellent qualities, his performance became more vigorous and powerful. Some of our actors who played the roles of the workers' masses initially thought that they were just "walking through," unimportant. Through learning from the dock workers, they realized that they were portraying the working class, the masters of the country, which was a great honor. As their understanding deepened and their thoughts became correct, their performances also became more energetic. For example, in the first scene, the dock workers are busy working under Gao Zhiyang's command, loading and unloading goods without much dialogue or singing, but they must embody the patriotism and internationalism of the dock workers and the bustling scene on the dock. Because they performed seriously, the atmosphere on stage became more lively and moving.

The dock workers also gave us a vivid lesson in proletarian artistic thought. Through learning from the dock workers, we deeply felt that the working class is the most understanding of art. They welcome art that serves proletarian politics and despise art that serves bourgeois politics. In 1964, some reactionary "authorities" who had once infiltrated the troupe and seized the director's position, from their bourgeois standpoint and needs, used the old Beijing opera method of "assigning roles" to present Fang Haizhen's entrance, and used the method of "ghost appearance" to present the so-called "complex inner world" of the young Han Xiaqiang, all of which were sharply criticized by the dock workers. A reactionary "authority" in presenting the dance movements of dock workers carrying bags designed a "dropping the bag" action: two people holding a sack of rice from a distance threw it onto a worker, who caught it with his shoulder. The man was very pleased with this action and highly appreciated it. But the workers were very angry after seeing it. They said, "Who can withstand a 200-pound sack of rice being thrown from a distance? This was used by the contractors in the old society to oppress workers, and we will never do this!" After rejecting this so-called "beautiful" action, they personally taught us the action of carrying bags, making our stage performance both true to life and artistic. Through this incident, we deeply understood that art has a clear class nature, that the bourgeoisie has its art, and the proletariat has its art, and this saying is absolutely true.

Chairman Mao taught us: "A writer or artist of real talent must go among the people, must go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, must go among the masses of people, must go into the thick of the struggle, and must change his or her ideology and worldview." In the process of creating and rehearsing "Harbor," we have initially done this and tasted some sweetness, but this is only the beginning, the first step of a long march. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, learn from the working class, take the workers as our teachers, accept the re-education of the working class, shift our stand to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and with the most enthusiastic political passion, sing the praises of the working class, create more and more perfect heroic images of the working class, and contribute to the cause of proletarian literature and art.

    向工人学习  拜工人为师
    上海京剧院《海港》剧组
    迎来春色满人间，祖国山河一片红。
    “工人阶级必须领导一切”。随着毛主席的这一伟大号令，浩浩荡荡的产业工人大军，纷纷开进文化、教育和其他一切上层建筑领域，一个气势磅礴的斗、批、改新高潮到来了。就在这个伟大的时刻，我们来到伟大领袖毛主席的身边，参加庆祝中华人民共和国成立十九周年的演出，我们感到无比幸福。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”回顾革命现代京剧《海港》的诞生，回顾我们在上海港向码头工人学习的过程，我们更体会到这一指示的英明、正确和伟大。
    一九六四年，根据江青同志的指示，我们来到了上海港码头，向工人学习，拜工人为师。一来到海港，我们就被海港码头雄伟的情景吸引住了。黄浦江上巨轮首尾相接，码头上拖车往返，吊车林立，码头工人以高涨的社会主义劳动热情，日日夜夜进行装卸。在码头上，我们与码头工人同吃、同住、同劳动。工人阶级的优秀品质，特别是他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，深深地教育了我们。我们到工人家中去访问时，看到每个工人家中迎门墙上都挂着毛主席像。每当谈到他们解放前后生活的对比、码头的变化和工作中取得的成绩时，他们总是激动地说：“这都是毛主席他老人家领导的好！”“这些成绩应当归功于毛主席。”码头工人对伟大领袖无比深厚的阶级感情，深深地感染着我们，鞭策着我们。
    码头工人对伟大领袖的这种热爱，是有其阶级根源的。在旧社会，码头工人被剥削阶级污蔑为“苦力”、“臭小工”，受尽压迫和剥削。在毛主席的领导下，他们得到了翻身解放，成了码头的主人，国家的主人。他们时时不忘旧社会的苦，新社会的甜。我们一上码头，他们就给我们上阶级教育课，用自己在旧社会的切身遭遇，指着那被汗水浸润、被肩膀磨光的毛竹杠棒，给我们讲家史，讲码头史；还带我们到现场指给我们看，在什么地方帝国主义、资本家和包工头关押、吊打工人，在什么地方他们曾经拿着杠棒和反动派进行过斗争；有些工人还脱下身上的衣服，让我们看那累累的伤疤。那含血带泪的控诉，那惊心动魄的斗争，深深地教育了我们每一个人。正是由于有这种强烈的爱憎，他们十分热爱《海港》，特别是阶级教育那一场，工人们每看一次，都边看边呼口号：“牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”由于学习了工人阶级这种优秀的品质，我们的思想感情逐步起了变化，也为在舞台上塑造工人阶级的英雄形象打下了坚实的基础。如演支部书记方海珍的演员，原来因自己缺乏码头工人的思想感情，再加上当时担任导演的反动学术“权威”要她成天跟着支部书记，搞什么“体会角色”、“捕捉形象”，因而没有和广大工人群众打成一片。后来，她学习了毛主席的教导：“我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来”以后，改变了作风，坚持深入生活，同工人打成一片，和工人们一起战斗，一起生活。在共同的战斗中，认识到用毛泽东思想武装起来的干部，不是高踞于群众之上，而是在群众之中，他们既带领群众前进，又是群众中普通的一员，是全心全意为人民服务的人民勤务员。在这个认识基础上塑造出来的支部书记方海珍，就受到工人们的欢迎。码头工人高兴地说：“这样的方海珍才象我们码头工人的支部书记。”
    《海港》是歌颂工人阶级的爱国主义和国际主义豪情壮志的。通过与码头工人同劳动、同生活，使我们对工人阶级这种崇高的品质有了比较深刻的认识。上海港是我国对外贸易主要港口之一，在这儿，通过码头工人的双手，每天有成千上万吨货物，运到亚、非、拉各国去，支援被压迫人民的革命斗争。原来在我们眼里看来只是些普普通通的货物，在码头工人眼里却是反帝反修的子弹，真是“一包一件紧连着世界风云”。正因为这样，他们工作起来生龙活虎，干劲冲天，认认真真，一丝不苟。码头上由于气候因素及其他原因，突击任务很多。不管任务多么繁重，工人们从来不喊困难，不讲条件，来多少，干多少，怎么来，怎么干。码头工人们这种全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的崇高品质，极大地教育了我们，对我们在舞台上塑造工人阶级英雄人物也有很大的启发。如扮演高志扬的演员，原来对码头工人这种革命精神了解很少，因而表现得不够豪迈有力。在与码头工人们一起劳动的过程中，有一次他亲眼看到工人们在接受一次突击任务时，豪迈地表示：“天塌下来我们顶得住！”他想起舞台上的英雄人物高志扬也同样有这样一句台词，也同样需要这样一种气魄，从中得到很大的启发，再加上与工人们同生活、同劳动，学习了工人阶级的优秀品质，因而表演得比较豪迈有力了。我们有些扮演工人群众的演员，原来认为自己反正是“走走过场”，无关紧要。通过向码头工人学习，认识到自己扮演的是工人阶级，是国家的主人，是十分光荣的。由于认识提高了，思想端正了，表演得也就比较有劲了。如第一场一开幕就是码头工人紧张劳动的场面。工人们在高志扬的指挥下装卸货物，没有什么语言和唱词，但必须体现出码头工人的爱国主义和国际主义豪情壮志，体现出码头上沸腾的景象，由于演得比较认真，因而舞台上的气氛也就比较热烈感人。
    码头工人还给我们上了生动的无产阶级文艺思想的一课。通过向码头工人学习，我们深深体会到工人阶级是最最懂得艺术的。他们所欢迎的是为无产阶级政治服务的艺术，憎恨的是为资产阶级政治服务的艺术。一九六四年，一些一度钻进剧组窃据导演大权的反动“权威”，从他们的资产阶级立场和需要出发，用旧京剧“点将”的方法来表现方海珍的出场，用“鬼魂出现”的方法来表现青年韩小强的所谓复杂的“内心世界”，都遭到了码头工人尖锐的批评。一个反动“权威”在表现码头工人扛包的舞蹈动作时，还设计了一个“摔包”的动作：两个人拎住一包大米，老远就往一个工人身上摔，这工人用肩接住。对这个动作，那家伙自鸣得意，非常欣赏。但工人们看后很气愤，他们说：“这二百斤包子老远摔在人身上谁吃得消。这是解放前包工头专门用来迫害工人的，我们决不能这样干！”他们否定了这个所谓“优美”的动作后，亲自教给我们扛包的动作，从而使我们舞台上的表演既符合生活真实，又体现了艺术的美。通过这件事，使我们深深地懂得，艺术是有鲜明的阶级性的，资产阶级有资产阶级的艺术，无产阶级有无产阶级的艺术，这句话真是一点也不假。
    毛主席教导我们：“有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”改造思想，改造世界观。在创作和排演《海港》的过程中，我们初步这样做了，也尝到了一些甜头，但这仅仅是开始，是万里长征的第一步。我们决心按照毛主席的教导，向工人阶级学习，拜工人为师，接受工人阶级的再教育，将立足点移到工农兵这方面来，以最饱满的政治热情歌颂工人阶级，塑造出更多、更高大、更完美的工人阶级英雄形象，为无产阶级的文艺事业作出贡献。
