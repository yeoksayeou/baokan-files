The winds of the East are prevailing, and the red flag is flying high. The publication of Chairman Mao's latest directive is like a spring thunder that shakes the earth. Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. This is a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought that resonates through the clouds.

When we heard Chairman Mao's latest directive, we sang, we danced, and we couldn't help but raise our arms and shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, we have so many heartfelt words to tell you, so many passionate songs to sing to you. We sincerely wish you, our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao pointed out: "A person has arteries and veins, and the blood circulates through the heart. It also needs to go through the lungs to breathe, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen. This is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party also needs to expel the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. If it does not eliminate waste and absorb fresh blood, the party will lose its vitality." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented large-scale rectification movement conducted through revolutionary methods. In this cultural revolution, we must expel the handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the party. These enemies are the "carbon dioxide," the "waste." Absorbing a group of advanced elements from the working class and excellent revolutionary rebels into the party, these are the "oxygen," the "fresh blood."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of state power." The handful of class enemies who have infiltrated the party leadership, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, do not absorb advanced elements of the proletariat into the party. Instead, they bring in traitors, spies, labor bosses, and counter-revolutionaries. They peddle the theory of "the extinction of class struggle" to lull the broad masses of Communist Party members into complacency. They use the theory of "taming tools" to suppress the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of Communist Party members. They maliciously attempt to negate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prepare for the restoration of capitalism. How evil their intentions are!

The capitalist-roaders and a handful of class enemies in our factory have implemented the revisionist line of building the party advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. The first person they developed into a party member was a foreman. Every time there was a remembrance meeting to recall past hardships, he would go on stage as an "old worker" to recount his "sufferings," openly challenging the dictatorship of the proletariat! Due to the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of the theory of "the extinction of class struggle" and the protection of the capitalist-roaders in our factory, this foreman has been allowed to stay in the party for a long time. This is intolerable!

Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have risen up to thoroughly criticize and repudiate all the capitalist-roaders in the party, big and small, and have seized back the leadership power from them, returning it to the hands of the proletariat. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against class enemies." This is the great program for building the party of the proletariat. We must study it well, implement it earnestly, and carry it out resolutely.

The editorial in the fourth issue of the "Red Flag" magazine published a passage from a worker comrade in our Shanghai Valve Factory who wants to join the party. This is not just the words of one comrade; it is the heartfelt words of every revolutionary rebel who wants to join the party. We revolutionary rebels who are not yet party members have been tempered and become even stronger after more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Our desire to join the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, personally founded and nurtured by Chairman Mao, has become even more urgent. We revolutionary rebels are rebelling to defend Chairman Mao, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to overthrow the handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the party, and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. We join the party for the cause of communism. We are willing to devote our lives to the cause of communism and to make contributions to the international communist movement. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also needs to liberate all of humanity." We cannot forget that the majority of people in the world are still suffering in deep water and fire, and that there is still the rule of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism. We must plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world and thoroughly bury the rule of imperialism and modern revisionism. Chairman Mao supports us rebels, and we must make him proud. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for the working class. We will resolutely follow the broad road indicated by Chairman Mao and march forward bravely!

    毛主席说出了我们工人的心里话
    上海阀门一厂工人　徐宗梁　蒋明才　徐德金　陆爱婷　蔡国夫
    东风浩荡，红旗漫展，毛主席最新指示的发表，象一声春雷震撼大地。无产阶级文化大革命在毛主席亲自领导下，已取得了伟大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的一曲响彻云霄的凯歌。
    当我们收听到毛主席的最新指示以后，我们唱啊，跳啊，情不自禁地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，我们有多少贴心的话儿要对您讲，有多少热情的歌儿要对您唱，我们衷心祝愿您，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席指出：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”无产阶级文化大革命是一次以革命的方法进行的空前规模的开门整党运动。在这场文化大革命中，要把钻进党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和一切反革命分子清除出党。这一小撮敌人就是“二氧化碳”，就是“废料”。吸收一批产业工人中的先进分子、优秀的造反派战士入党，这些就是“氧气”，就是“新鲜血液”。
    毛主席教导我们说：“革命的根本问题是政权问题。”中国赫鲁晓夫等钻进党的领导机关的一小撮阶级敌人，他们不吸收无产阶级先进分子入党，而是把那些叛徒、特务、工贼、反革命分子，拉入党内。他们大肆贩卖“阶级斗争熄灭论”，麻痹广大共产党员的斗志，以“驯服工具论”来压制广大共产党员的革命造反精神，妄图否定无产阶级专政，为复辟资本主义作准备，用心何其毒也！
    我们厂的走资派和一小撮阶级敌人，推行了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。他们第一个发展的党员就是工头，每次忆苦思甜大会，都要他以“老工人”的身份上台诉“苦”，明目张胆地向无产阶级专政挑衅！由于中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”和我厂走资派的包庇，使这个工头长期混在党内，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    无产阶级文化大革命开始后，我们在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，起来大造特造党内大大小小的走资派的反，把他们所篡夺的领导权，重新夺回到我们无产阶级手里。毛主席指出：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”这是伟大的无产阶级建党纲领，我们必须很好学习、认真贯彻、坚决执行。
    《红旗》杂志第四期社论，刊登了我们上海阀门一厂一个要求入党的工人同志的一段话，这不仅仅是一个同志的语言，这是我们每一个要求入党的无产阶级革命造反派战士的心里话。我们这些还不是党员的革命造反派战士，经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命的严峻考验，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，磨炼得更坚强了，我们要加入毛主席亲自缔造和培育的伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党的愿望更加迫切了。我们无产阶级革命派战士造反是为了保卫毛主席，为了捍卫毛泽东思想，为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为了打倒党内一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，巩固无产阶级专政。我们入党是为了共产主义事业，我们愿为共产主义事业奋斗终身，也要为国际共产主义运动作出贡献。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。”我们不能忘了世界上还有大多数人民处于水深火热之中，还有美帝、苏修的统治。我们一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全世界，彻底埋葬帝国主义、现代修正主义的统治。毛主席为我们革命造反派撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气，我们决不辜负毛主席他老人家对我们工人阶级的殷切期望，坚决沿着毛主席所指引的康庄大道，奋勇前进！
