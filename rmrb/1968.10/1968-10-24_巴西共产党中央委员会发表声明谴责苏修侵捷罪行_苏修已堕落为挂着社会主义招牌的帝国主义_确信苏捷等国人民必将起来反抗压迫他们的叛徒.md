The Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party recently issued a statement strongly condemning the crime of the Soviet revisionist clique invading Czechoslovakia. The statement points out: The modern revisionists of the Soviet Union have degenerated into imperialists who hang out the banner of socialism, colluding with American imperialism to attempt to partition the world.

The statement says, the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries is one of the greatest crimes committed by modern revisionists. The despicable acts of the clique headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin have sullied the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Soviet people and have begun typical imperialist actions.

The statement points out that the current Soviet leadership is a traitor to the workers' movement, representing a bourgeois privileged stratum within Soviet society. Under the rule of this revisionist clique, the nature of the system established by the October Revolution has changed, the achievements of socialism have been destroyed, and capitalism has been restored. These traitors have sunk to the most shameless depths: colluding with American imperialism to attempt to divide the world into spheres of influence for the United States and the Soviet Union. They have formed a holy alliance with the most reactionary forces against the peoples of all countries, against revolution, and against communism.

The statement says, the Czechoslovakian revisionists are also sliding down the same path of betrayal. They have also squandered the achievements of the working people and led their country towards capitalism. Novotny is a thoroughgoing revisionist, and his successor Dubcek is also a shameless revisionist.

The statement continues, the Soviet modern revisionists have exposed their true colors to the people of the world: they are nothing but imperialists and fascists who hang out the banner of defenders of socialism; they hypocritically wave the banner of communism, deceiving the working people, oppressing the Soviet people and the peoples of other countries; they never stop mentioning Lenin's name, but they are executing a policy that completely denies Leninism. They are a bunch of shameless politicians who collude with the White House bandits to attempt to rule the world.

The statement points out that the Brazilian people have recognized that the Soviet Union is no longer a socialist country, and the Brazilian Communist Party strongly condemns the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Currently, although revisionism rules Czechoslovakia, the working people of Czechoslovakia will undertake the historical task of rebuilding the dictatorship of the proletariat and eliminating the traitors of the communist cause. At the same time, it is necessary to overthrow the bourgeois privileged stratum that dominates the Soviet Union, and this task will be accomplished by the working class and the laboring people of the Soviet Union. The statement says, the proletarian revolutionaries of Brazil have always unremittingly exposed the crimes of revisionism. Together with Marxist-Leninists from all over the world, they support and assist the people of Lenin's homeland, Gottwald's homeland, and other countries to overthrow the revisionist clique. They are convinced that the people of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and other countries will rise up to resist the traitors who oppress them. The Brazilian Communist Party advocates that the revolutionary people of the world unite and persistently fight against American imperialism and its ally, Soviet revisionism.

The statement concludes: "Millions of simple people around the world, including the Soviet people, have already recognized that Brezhnev and Kosygin are enemies of the peoples of all countries, executing a policy that goes against the interests of the peoples of all countries. The struggle of the peoples of all countries will inevitably be directed against modern revisionism and American imperialism.

"The parties of Marxism-Leninism have gained the greatest prestige and authority because they constantly and unremittingly expose the betrayal of revisionism and point out the true revolutionary path. Truth is on the side of the Marxist-Leninist parties. Under the wise leadership of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, which upholds the dictatorship of the proletariat and raises high the banner of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become the strongest and most advanced force in the world revolution. The Party of Labor of Albania, led by the tested Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, has become an invincible socialist stronghold.

"No matter how much the imperialists and revisionists strengthen their counter-revolutionary activities, the revolution is advancing irresistibly. The sparks of class struggle are spreading all over the world. No one can stop the victory of the peoples of the world. Communism is becoming the great and only hope of the oppressed and exploited, the beacon light for the peoples who are breaking free from capitalist oppression."

    巴西共产党中央委员会发表声明谴责苏修侵捷罪行
    苏修已堕落为挂着社会主义招牌的帝国主义
    确信苏捷等国人民必将起来反抗压迫他们的叛徒
    新华社二十三日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西共产党中央委员会最近发表声明，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团侵略捷克斯洛伐克的罪行。声明指出：苏联现代修正主义者已经堕落成挂着社会主义招牌的帝国主义分子，同美帝国主义勾结在一起妄图瓜分世界。
    声明说，苏联及其华沙条约同盟国部队对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略是现代修正主义者所犯的最大罪恶之一。以勃列日涅夫和柯西金为首的集团的丑恶行为沾污了苏联人民的光荣的革命传统，开始了典型的帝国主义性质的行动。
    声明指出，苏联现领导集团是工人运动的叛徒，是苏联社会中的一个资产阶级特权阶层的代表。在这个修正主义集团的统治下，十月革命创建的制度的性质改变了，社会主义的成果毁灭了，资本主义复辟了。这伙叛徒们已经滑到了最无耻的地步：同美帝国主义勾结，妄图在全世界划分美国和苏联的势力范围。他们同最反动的势力结成了一个反对各国人民、反对革命和反对共产主义的神圣同盟。
    声明说，捷克斯洛伐克修正主义者正沿着同样的背叛道路滑下去。他们也葬送了劳动人民取得的成果，把他们的国家引向了资本主义。诺沃提尼是一个地地道道的修正主义分子，他的继承者杜布切克也是一个无耻的修正主义分子。
    声明继续说，苏联现代修正主义者在全世界人民面前暴露了他们的真正嘴脸：他们只不过是挂着社会主义保卫者招牌的帝国主义分子和法西斯分子；他们伪善地打着共产主义旗号，欺骗劳动人民，压迫苏联人民和其它各国人民；他们嘴边不离列宁的名字，但他们都执行着一种完全否认列宁主义的政策。他们是一批无耻的政客，同白宫强盗勾结在一起，妄图统治世界。
    声明指出，巴西人民认识到苏联已不再是社会主义国家，巴西共产党强烈地谴责苏联对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略。目前，尽管修正主义统治着捷克斯洛伐克，但是，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民将担负重建无产阶级专政和消灭共产主义事业的叛徒的历史任务。同时，还必须打倒在苏联占统治地位的资产阶级特权阶层，而这一任务必将由苏联工人阶级和劳动人民来完成。声明说，巴西的无产阶级革命者始终不渝地揭露修正主义的丑行。他们同全世界马克思列宁主义者一起，支持和声援列宁的祖国、哥特瓦尔德的祖国和其它国家的人民起来推翻修正主义集团。他们确信捷克斯洛伐克人民、苏联人民和其他国家的人民将起来反抗压迫他们的叛徒。巴西共产党主张，全世界革命人民联合起来，进行坚持不懈地反对美帝国主义及其同盟者苏联修正主义者的斗争。
    声明最后说：“全世界千百万质朴的人民，包括苏联人民在内，已经认识到，勃列日?夫和柯西金是各国人民的敌人，他们执行着一种违背各国人民利益的政策。各国人民的斗争矛头必将指向现代修正主义和美帝国主义。
    “马克思列宁主义的党赢得了最大的声誉和威望，因为它们经常不断地揭露修正主义的背叛行为，并指出了真正的革命道路。真理在马克思列宁主义党一边。中国共产党坚持无产阶级专政和高举无产阶级文化大革命的旗帜，在毛泽东的英明领导下，成了世界革命最强大和最先进的队伍。由久经考验的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查领导的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，成了一个不可战胜的社会主义的堡垒。
    “不管帝国主义者和修正主义者如何地加强其反革命活动，革命正在势不可挡地前进。阶级斗争的火种正遍及全世界。任何人都不能阻挡世界人民的胜利。共产主义越来越成了被剥削者和被压迫者的巨大和唯一的希望，成了正在摆脱资本主义压迫的人民的指路明灯。”
