Golden mangoes sent to Guizhou,
Guizhou workers' hearts are filled with joy.
Guizhou's mountains and rivers connect to Tiananmen,
Class solidarity runs deep as the sea.
The great leader waves his mighty hand,
We workers stride forward with big steps;
The great commander gives the order,
We strive to do well in struggle, criticism, and reform!

    金芒果转送到贵州来
    贵州工人　钟立芳
    金芒果转送到贵州来，
    贵州的工人喜满怀。
    贵州的山水紧连天安门，
    阶级的情谊深似海。
    伟大的领袖挥巨手，
    咱工人大步朝前迈；
    伟大的统帅一声令，
    咱努力搞好斗、批、改！
