I have just returned from attending the National Day celebrations, and together with my comrades, I am transforming Chairman Mao's warm concern into a tremendous force. With boundless enthusiasm and ambition, I am striving to achieve new victories in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The important editorial in the *Red Flag* magazine has conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making us feel especially close, especially joyful, and especially excited.

I am a poor child who was born and raised in bitterness. In the old society, those landlords and capitalists looked down on people like us as less than grass. After liberation, it was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who nurtured me into a master of the state. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary comrades have appointed me as the deputy director of our factory's revolutionary committee. In April of this year, I was honored to join the vanguard organization of the Chinese working class—the Chinese Communist Party. During the National Day celebrations, I, along with nearly a hundred worker representatives from Qinghai Province, went to Beijing to attend the celebrations and saw our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao. Reflecting on the past and looking at the present, I have endless words and endless songs. No matter how many words or songs, they cannot fully express my boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao. I want to shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! I want to wish Chairman Mao a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao forever! Forever!

Chairman Mao's recent instructions on party rectification and building are the greatest concern and greatest encouragement for new party members like me. They give me endless strength to carry on the revolution to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our power comes from whom? It comes from the working class, from the poor and lower-middle peasants, from the broad laboring masses who make up more than ninety percent of the population. We represent the proletariat, we represent the people, we have overthrown the people's enemies, and the people support us. The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses." I must firmly remember Chairman Mao's profound teachings, constantly renew my mind, and constantly eliminate all kinds of bourgeois thoughts, not allowing them any space in my mind. At the same time, I must persistently and consistently study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, earnestly study, resolutely carry out, actively propagate, and bravely defend the great thoughts of Chairman Mao in any situation, so that the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao can always take root in my mind. This is not just a beautiful slogan; it is a vow of action. I will never consider myself an "old revolutionary" and will definitely do the following: the more achievements I have, the more I will humbly be a student of the masses; the busier my work is, the more I will seize the time to participate in collective production labor, so that I can always maintain the character of a laboring people, actively participate in the current struggle, criticism, and transformation movement, and forever be a vibrant proletarian revolutionary fighter.

    永远做一个朝气蓬勃的共产党员
    青海红卫第一机床厂革命委员会副主任、新党员  马风华
    我参加国庆观礼回来不久，正和战友们一起，把毛主席的亲切关怀化为巨大力量，满怀豪情壮志在斗、批、改中立新功的时候，《红旗》杂志重要社论又传达了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，使我们感到格外亲切，格外喜悦，格外激动。
    我是一个在苦水里生，苦水里长大的穷孩子。在旧社会，那些地主老财、资本家把我们这样的人看得不如一棵草。解放了，是毛主席和共产党把我培养成国家的主人。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，革命的同志们又让我担任了我们厂革命委员会的副主任。今年四月，我光荣地加入了中国工人阶级自己的先锋队组织——中国共产党。国庆节，我又同青海省近百名工人代表一起到北京，参加了国庆观礼，见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。想想过去，看看今天，我有说不尽的话，我有唱不完的歌。千句话，万支歌，也表达不尽我对毛主席他老人家的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。我要一千遍、一万遍地欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！我要一千遍、一万遍地敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席最近发出的关于整党建党的最新指示，是对象我这样刚刚加入党组织的新党员的最大关怀，最大鞭策，给了我革命到底的无穷无尽的力量。
    毛主席教导说：“我们的权力是谁给的？是工人阶级给的，是贫下中农给的，是占人口百分之九十以上的广大劳动群众给的。我们代表了无产阶级，代表了人民群众，打倒了人民的敌人，人民就拥护我们。共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”我要牢牢记住毛主席这一深刻的教导，不断地在自己头脑中吐故纳新，不断地清除形形色色的资产阶级思想，不让它们在头脑里有半点位置；同时，不断地、始终如一地坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，在任何情况下都要认真学习、坚决执行、积极宣传、勇敢捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想永远在自己头脑中扎根。这不是一句漂亮的口号，这是行动的誓言。我决不以“老造反”自居，坚决做到：成绩越大越要甘当群众的小学生，工作越忙越要抓紧时间参加集体生产劳动，使自己永远保持劳动人民的本色，积极投入当前的斗、批、改运动，永远做一个朝气蓬勃的无产阶级革命战士。
