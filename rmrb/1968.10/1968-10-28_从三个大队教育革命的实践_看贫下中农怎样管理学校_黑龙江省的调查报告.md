Editor's Note: This report is vividly written, with contrasts, data, and summaries, helping people to have a concrete understanding of the harm caused by the bourgeoisie's control over schools and the benefits of poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "Now the school is ours." Isn't this the greatest praise for the educational revolution?

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Laiwaizi, Songshugou, and Waisandou Production Brigades of Laihui Commune in Aihui County have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's directives for the proletarian educational revolution. Last November, they marched into the schools, seized the educational power in rural areas in one stroke, and broke the monopoly of the bourgeois intellectuals. The poor and lower-middle peasants have become the masters of culture and the main force of the proletarian educational revolution in rural areas. They have implemented the latest directive of the great leader Chairman Mao, which states: "In rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Destroying the Rule of Bourgeois Intellectuals Over Schools

Since the founding of the nation, under the control of the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, the leadership of rural schools has basically been in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals. Taking Songshugou Primary School as an example, since liberation, there have been five changes of school principals or directors, all of whom are from landlord and rich peasant families. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "We have stood up politically and economically, but we have not stood up culturally. These years, we have only held onto our hoes, not our pens."

Under the control of bourgeois intellectuals, rural schools have opened the door wide for landlords and rich peasants. In Songshugou Brigade, out of the twelve landlord and rich peasant households, four have gone to college since liberation. Some work in important state organs, and some are engineers in factories. Of the twelve children of landlords and rich peasants, six are in middle school, and none are illiterate. In contrast, out of the fifty-four households of poor and lower-middle peasants, none have gone to college, and only one has attended a vocational school. Of the poor and lower-middle peasant youth aged 18 to 28, not one has graduated from junior high school, and more than thirty are illiterate or semi-illiterate. The rich peasant's son, Guan Shiqiu, from primary school to high school graduation, has always enjoyed free education or scholarships, while forty-four poor and lower-middle peasant children have dropped out of school due to financial difficulties. In the second production team of Waisandou, since 1956, out of fifty-one households of poor and lower-middle peasants, only four children have attended junior high school, but all have dropped out due to inability to pay tuition. The rich peasant Guan Tongshi's family has five children: three graduated from junior high school, one from senior high school, and one from college. The poor and lower-middle peasants indignantly say: "The schools after liberation are not for us poor and lower-middle peasants; they are still for the children of landlords and rich peasants, for their succession, and for oppressing us poor and lower-middle peasants."

Under the control of bourgeois intellectuals, the schools instill feudal, capitalist, and revisionist poison, cultivating successors of the bourgeoisie. A rich peasant's son, a teacher, openly poisoned the students on the podium: "Now there are no landlords and rich peasants. Landlords are like those in movies, holding a civilized stick, with a mustache, and a big belly." "Landlords and rich peasants can also lead the revolution." Under the poisoning of the revisionist educational line, after poor and lower-middle peasant children go to middle school, they no longer want to return to the countryside and only want to stay in the city. Since 1956, the second production team of Waisandou has had eighteen educated youth who have left the countryside and entered the city, making it difficult for the production team to find an accountant. The poor and lower-middle peasants painfully say: "Students go to the city to study, despise our countryside, and do not want to talk to us. They walk far away from us. They have corrupted our children."

The revisionist educational line has harmed the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and their children. The poor and lower-middle peasants hate it to the bone. They angrily say: "Why do our children have fewer opportunities to study and cannot enter higher schools?" This mystery was only solved during the Cultural Revolution. It was the trick of China's Khrushchev, and the poor and lower-middle peasants had not seized the power of the pen. Chairman Mao said: "The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." This battle cry, like a spring thunder, awakened the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They firmly said: "We not only need to seize the gun and the stamp, but also the pen. If we cannot manage the pen, we will lose the stamp and the gun." Thus, they raised the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and smashed the revisionist educational line, seized the power of the pen, and occupied the school battlefield.

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Managing Schools is a Power Struggle

The poor and lower-middle peasants marched into the schools and seized the power of the pen. This is a profound ideological revolution and social revolution, a sharp power struggle on the educational front.

In the schools, untransformed bourgeois intellectuals, together with the ghosts and demons in society, spread rumors and set fires, fiercely opposing the poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely implemented and bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian educational revolutionary line, engaging in a head-on struggle with them.

They said: "Poor and lower-middle peasants seizing the power of the pen, is the power of the pen so easy to seize!" "Managing what school, not even recognizing a single character!" The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly replied: "With Chairman Mao backing us, we will definitely seize the educational power!" "With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we will definitely manage the power of the pen well and manage the schools well! We do not trust you managing the schools."

They said: "You do not understand the rules of the school. School education work is sacred and inviolable!" The poor and lower-middle peasants decisively said: "Put away your old rules. Now we listen to the poor and lower-middle peasants! We will resolutely smash those revisionist junk!"

The poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," led the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools, striking at the heart of the revisionist educational line, disrupting their plans. The bourgeois intellectuals jumped up and down, saying: "Students are too young to work," "Children feeding pigs are only excited for three days," "Students learning to drive tractors in the fields waste production." They also held secret meetings, shooting arrows in the dark, maliciously saying: "Poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools are like a rabbit's tail that cannot grow long, and in the end, it will still be us teaching." They also incited among the students: "Studying a little is like throwing it away." Under their deception, thirty-eight students in Waisandou Agricultural Middle School had fluctuating thoughts at the beginning of this year. Some people fished for three days and dried for two, and six students simply went home and did not study.

Wave after wave of evil winds and heavy waves attempted to strangle this new thing in its cradle. Faced with this situation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw through their tricks at a glance. What to do? Chairman Mao said: "Holding study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." The revolutionary committees of these three brigades successively held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for the educational revolution, set up large-character posters for the educational revolution in schools and production teams, organized the masses to deeply study and vigorously publicize Chairman Mao's latest directives on the educational revolution, criticizing and exposing the revisionist educational line. This made the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants realize: managing schools is a need of the times, a great historical task entrusted to us poor and lower-middle peasants by the great leader Chairman Mao. Whether or not we manage the schools well is a major issue concerning the struggle for successors and whether the country changes color. They proudly said: "The rural schools belong to the poor and lower-middle peasants. We must occupy the educational battlefield and manage the schools." They deeply carried out the revolutionary criticism and launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, finally exposing the black hands that sabotaged Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and sabotaged the Cultural Revolution. Songshugou Brigade exposed the rightist capitulationist clique led by the stubborn rich peasant's son and primary school teacher Meng Xianjun, and Waisandou Brigade exposed the Kuomintang district party department propaganda department head, special agent, primary school teacher Wu Wenxu, and the active counter-revolutionary Jiang Weibin. Exposing the enemies educated the masses and achieved victory in the power struggle. They took one step at a time, following the bright path of educational revolution opened by Chairman Mao, managing the schools better and better every day.

The "May 7th Directive" is the Beacon for Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Managing Schools

Following the path indicated by the "May 7th Directive," the poor and lower-middle peasants closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest directives on the educational revolution, making the schools' appearance completely new.

1. Raised a Banner—The Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought

The first thing the poor and lower-middle peasants did in managing the schools was to vigorously promote the attitude of teachers and students towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy the classroom and command everything.

In the past, the first words students said upon entering school were "Good morning, teacher." Now the first words are "Long live Chairman Mao!" In the past, students saluted the teacher at the beginning of class; now they salute Chairman Mao. In the past, the first class was language or mathematics; now it is the unshakable "Daily Reading." In the past, those who studied hard and had high scores were good students; now those who actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought are good students. In the past, students were "deaf to the world outside the window, only reading the classics"; now they go out of the school gates to the masses, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, there were morning meetings, class meetings, and weekly meetings; now there are reporting meetings and "Criticize Self, Criticize Revisionism" meetings. In the past six months, the schools of these three brigades held twenty-four reporting meetings and eighty "Criticize Self, Criticize Revisionism" meetings, producing thirty-five active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought. Songshugou Middle School became a provincial, municipal, and county advanced collective for actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

2. Persisted on a Path—Walking the Path of Combining Education with Industry and Agriculture

The poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools persisted in serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, and walking the path of combining with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They led the students out of the school gates, into the three great revolutionary movements, experiencing wind and rain and seeing the world. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students of Waisandou Production Brigade jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying Chairman Mao's works, carrying out "Criticize Self, Criticize Revisionism," making revolutionary teachers and students better learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, promoting the thought revolutionization of teachers and students. The revolutionary committee of Songshugou Brigade, to better carry out class and class struggle education for revolutionary teachers and students, let them grow and temper themselves in great winds and waves, and recruited two students to participate in the deep excavation of the leading group. Broad masses of teachers and students, in fighting together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, tempered their hearts of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. These three production brigades also regularly organized revolutionary teachers and students to participate in collective labor in production teams. In the past six months, on average, each person participated in thirty-nine days of collective production labor. In labor practice, many students basically mastered a set of agricultural production skills.

These three brigades' schools have established production bases. This year, they planted 303 mu of land. Revolutionary teachers and students labored on the production base, engaged in on-site teaching, and carried out scientific experimental activities. Schools managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants are not only schools but also production teams and scientific experimental fields. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "In the past, the students we cultivated were estranged from us, could not sit together, could not work together, and could not talk together. Now they are both students and community members, truly our reliable successors."

3. Built a Team—Rectified, Transformed, and Rebuilt the Rural Teacher Team

After the poor and lower-middle peasants managed the schools, based on the cleanup of the original teacher team, they selected ten poor and lower-middle peasant-returned educated youth with proletarian awareness and production experience to be teachers (the least worked in the countryside for one or two years, the most worked for ten years). At the same time, they hired twenty poor and lower-middle peasants as part-time teachers to give classes to students regularly. They let the bitter and deep-hating old poor peasants teach class struggle courses; let the active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought teach Chairman Mao's works; let revolutionary cadres teach political courses; let experienced old farmers teach agricultural technology courses; let workers teach agricultural machinery courses; let militia cadres teach military courses; let brigade accountants teach rural applied mathematics courses; let rural health workers teach health knowledge courses. These comrades taught closely combined with the actual situations of the three great revolutionary movements, deeply and vividly, and in a way that was easy to understand, making students learn many things they could not learn from books. The poor and lower-middle peasants entering the schools and standing on the podium enriched the teacher team, changed the class composition of the teachers, fundamentally seized the educational power, and ended the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools. To strengthen the transformation of the teacher team, they also organized revolutionary teachers to participate in the three great revolutionary movements with the students and the poor and lower-middle peasants, walking the path of combining with the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly changing the bourgeois educational ideas they received from bourgeois education in the past.

4. Implemented a Unified Popular Education—Opening the Door Wide for Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Children to Enter School

In the past, poor and lower-middle peasant children faced many barriers to entering school: primary school, complete primary school, middle school; tuition fees, exam promotion barriers, age entry barriers, etc., keeping the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasant children out of the school gates. The poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools smashed these rules and regulations, opening the door wide for poor and lower-middle peasant children to enter school. According to the investigation of these three brigades, they adopted three methods to solve the problem of poor and lower-middle peasant children entering school: (1) Setting up junior high school classes in primary schools, studying middle school without leaving the village; (2) Reducing the burden on poor and lower-middle peasants, exempting students from tuition and miscellaneous fees, and providing assistance from the public welfare fund of the production team for children from families with special difficulties, carrying out mass mutual aid activities, and poor and lower-middle peasants voluntarily saving money to buy clothes, hats, and shoes for children from poor and lower-middle peasant families with financial difficulties; (3) Abolishing the old rules and regulations that restricted poor and lower-middle peasant children from entering school, such as entrance and promotion exams, six-year primary school, three-year junior high school, implementing a seven-year continuous system, making all school-age youth enter school. Laiwaizi Production Brigade also organized eighteen preschool children, giving them two classes a day, including preschool children's education in school education. Unified popular education was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

5. Formed a Leadership Group—Proletarian Educational Revolutionary Leadership Group with Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants as the Main Body

These three brigades, in November last year, established a proletarian educational revolutionary leadership group composed of responsible persons of the brigade revolutionary committee, poor and lower-middle peasant representatives, militia company commanders, and revolutionary teacher and student representatives, ensuring that the educational power in rural areas is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The brigade revolutionary committee included the management of schools in the agenda, regularly discussing and researching school work, with the responsible persons personally leading, treating the school as one of the brigade's production teams and a militia platoon. This changed the past relationship where the school and the production team "heard the sounds of chickens and dogs but did not communicate." Teachers and students said: "The production team is our production team." The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The school is our school."

    从三个大队教育革命的实践  看贫下中农怎样管理学校
    ———黑龙江省的调查报告
    编者按：这篇报告写得很生动，有对比，有材料，有总结，使人们对资产阶级统治学校的毒害和贫下中农管理学校的好处，有一个具体的认识。贫下中农说：现在“学校是咱们的学校”了，这不是对教育革命最大的赞美吗？
    爱辉县爱辉公社拉腰子、松树沟、外三道沟三个生产大队的广大贫下中农，坚决贯彻毛主席无产阶级教育革命的指示，于去年十一月开进了学校，一举夺回了农村教育大权，打破了资产阶级知识分子独霸的一统天下。贫下中农当了文化的主人，成为农村无产阶级教育革命的主力军。实现了伟大领袖毛主席最近发出的“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示。
    摧毁资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治
    建国以来，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线统治下，农村学校的领导权基本上是被资产阶级知识分子把持着。以松树沟小学为例，解放以来，先后调换过五次学区组长或主任，都是地主富农家庭出身的。贫下中农说：“我们在政治上、经济上翻了身，但在文化上没有翻身。这些年来，我们光握锄杆子了，没有抓着笔杆子。”
    在资产阶级知识分子把持下的农村学校，为地主富农大开方便之门。松树沟大队的十二户地主富农中，解放以来，就有四个念大学的，他们有的在国家重要机关工作，有的在工厂里当工程师。现有十二名地富子弟中，就有六个中学生，没有一个文盲。相反，全大队五十四户贫下中农，没有一个上大学的，仅有一名念了中专。现有十八岁至二十八岁的贫下中农青年，没有一个初中毕业生，其中三十余人处于文盲或半文盲状态。富农子弟关世厚，从小学五年到中学毕业，一直享受免费入学或助学金待遇，而贫下中农子女却有四十四名因生活困难中途辍学。外三道沟第二生产队，从一九五六年以来，五十一户贫下中农，只有四个贫下中农子女上了初中，但都因为缴不起学费中途退学了。而富农关佟氏一家五个子女，初中毕业三人，高中一人，大学毕业生一人。贫下中农愤慨地说：“解放后的学堂，不是为咱贫下中农办的，仍旧是为地主富农子女服务，为他们传宗接代，专了咱贫下中农的政。”
    在资产阶级知识分子把持下的学校，灌输的是封、资、修的黑货，培养的是资产阶级的接班人。一个富农子弟教师在讲台上公开地向学生放毒：“现在没有地主富农了，地主就是象演电影那样的，拿着文明棍，留着八字胡，挺着大肚子。”“地主富农也能领导革命。”在修正主义教育路线的毒害下，贫下中农子女上了中学以后，就不想再回农村了，一心想留在城市。外三道沟第二生产队从一九五六年以来，十八名知识青年，先后离开了农村，流入城市，致使生产队找一个会计都很困难。贫下中农沉痛地说：“学生进城念书，讨厌咱农村了，也不愿和咱说话了，走路离咱老远的，他们把咱们的孩子给教坏了。”
    修正主义教育路线坑害了广大贫下中农及其子女。对此，广大贫下中农恨之入骨，他们气愤地说：“为什么我们的孩子念书的少，进不了大学校？”这个谜直到文化大革命才解开了，就是中国赫鲁晓夫捣的鬼，贫下中农没有掌握文权。毛主席说：
  “资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”这个战斗号召，象一声春雷，唤起了广大贫下中农，他们坚定地说：“我们不但要掌握枪杆子、印把子，还要掌握笔杆子。我们管不好笔杆子，就要丢掉印把子和枪杆子。”于是他们奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，摧垮了修正主义教育路线，夺回了文权，占领了学校阵地。
    贫下中农管理学校是一场夺权斗争
    贫下中农开进了学校，掌握了文权，这是一场深刻的思想大革命和社会大革命，是教育战线上一场尖锐的夺权斗争。
    学校中没有改造好的资产阶级知识分子，伙同社会上的牛鬼蛇神，煽阴风，点鬼火，拚命反对贫下中农管理学校。广大贫下中农心怀对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，坚决执行、勇敢捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级教育革命路线，同他们进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    他们说：“贫下中农掌文权，文权那么好掌的！”“管啥学校，连个字都不认识！”贫下中农坚定地回答：“有毛主席给我们撑腰，教育大权我们是掌定了！”“有毛泽东思想作武器，我们一定能够掌好文权，管理好学校！你们管学校，我们不放心。”
    他们说：“你们不懂学校的规矩，学校教育工作是神圣不可侵犯的！”贫下中农斩钉截铁地说：“收起你们那套旧规矩，现在要听贫下中农的话！我们坚决砸碎那些修正主义的破烂货！”
    贫下中农按照毛主席的“五·七”指示，领导学校的斗、批、改，击中了修正主义教育路线的要害，打乱了他们的阵脚，资产阶级知识分子先生们上窜下跳地说：“学生年龄小不能干活”，“小孩子喂猪是三天新鲜”，“学生在地里学开拖拉机耽误生产”。他们还暗地里开黑会，放冷箭，恶毒地说：“贫下中农管学校是兔子尾巴长不了，将来还得我们教。”并且在学生中煽动：“念了点书，等于白扔。”在他们蒙蔽下，外三道沟农中三十八名学生，今年年初很多人思想波动，有些人三天打鱼两天晒网，六名学生干脆回家不念了。
    阵阵妖风，重重恶浪，企图把这一新生事物扼杀在摇篮里。面对这种情况，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农，一眼就看穿了他们的阴谋诡计。怎么办？毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”这三个大队革命委员会先后举办了教育革命毛泽东思想学习班，在学校和生产队办起了教育革命大字报专栏，组织群众深入学习和大张旗鼓地宣传毛主席教育革命的最新指示，批判、控诉修正主义教育路线。使广大贫下中农认识到：贫下中农管理学校是时代的需要，是伟大领袖毛主席交给我们贫下中农的伟大历史任务，管不管好学校，是关系到争夺接班人，国家变不变颜色的大问题。他们自豪地说：“农村学校的天下是贫下中农的，学校的教育阵地我们要占，学校的大权我们要管。”他们深入开展了革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动了猛烈的进攻，终于揪出了破坏毛主席无产阶级教育路线，破坏文化大革命的黑手。松树沟大队揪出了顽固坚持反动立场的富农子弟、小学教师孟宪军为首的右倾翻案集团，外三道沟大队揪出了国民党区党部宣传部长、修特分子、小学教师武文绪和现行反革命分子姜渭斌。揪出了敌人，教育了群众，取得了夺权斗争的胜利。他们一步一个脚印，沿着毛主席开辟的教育革命的光辉航道，把学校管理得一天比一天好。
    “五·七”指示是贫下中农管理学校的指路明灯
    贫下中农沿着“五·七”指示指引的道路，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的关于教育革命一系列最新指示，使学校面貌焕然一新。
    一、高举了一面旗帜——毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    贫下中农管理学校的第一件事，就是大抓狠抓了师生对毛主席、毛泽东思想的态度问题，让毛泽东思想占领课堂，统帅一切。
    过去学生到校的第一句话是“老师早安”，现在第一句话是“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”过去上课向老师敬礼，现在是向毛主席敬礼；过去第一节课是语文、数学，现在是雷打不动的“天天读”；过去谁死读书分数高，谁是“好学生”，现在谁活学活用毛泽东思想，谁是好学生；过去学生是“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读‘圣贤’书”，现在是走出校门深入群众，热情宣传毛泽东思想；过去是早会、班会、周会，现在是讲用会、“斗私，批修”会。半年来，三个大队的学校共开了讲用会二十四次，“斗私，批修”会八十次，涌现出活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子三十五名。松树沟中学变成了省、地、县活学活用毛泽东思想的先进集体。
    二、坚持了一条道路——走与工农相结合的道路
    贫下中农管理学校，坚持了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，走与贫下中农相结合的道路。他们带领学生走出校门，到三大革命运动中，经风雨见世面。外三道沟生产大队贫下中农和革命师生共办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席著作，开展“斗私，批修”，使革命师生更好地向贫下中农学习，促进了师生的思想革命化。松树沟大队革委会为了更好地对革命师生进行阶级和阶级斗争教育，让他们在大风大浪中锻炼成长，吸收了两名学生参加深挖领导小组工作。广大师生在同贫下中农一起战斗中锤炼了无限忠于毛主席的红心。这三个生产大队还定期组织革命师生到生产队参加集体劳动，半年来，平均每人参加三十九天集体生产劳动。在劳动实践中，很多学生基本上掌握了一套农业生产本领。
    这三个大队的学校都建立了生产基地。今年共种了三百零三亩地。革命师生在生产基地上进行劳动，从事现场教学，开展科学实验活动。贫下中农管理后的学校，既是一个学校，又是一个生产队，也是一个科学实验园地。贫下中农高兴地说：“过去培养的学生和我们离心离骨，坐不到一起，干不到一块，说不到一堆。现在他们又是学生，又是社员，真是我们可信的接班人。”
    三、建立了一支队伍——整顿、改造、重建了农村的教师队伍
    贫下中农管理学校后，在对原有教师队伍清理的基础上，选派了十名有无产阶级觉悟的、有生产实践经验的贫下中农出身的回乡知识青年当教师（最少的在农村劳动一、二年，最多的已劳动十年）。同时，又聘请了二十名贫下中农做兼职教员，定期给学生讲课。让苦大仇深的老贫农讲阶级斗争课；让活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子讲毛主席著作课；让革命干部讲政治课；让有经验的老农讲农业技术课；让工人讲农业机械课；让民兵干部讲军事课；让大队会计讲农村应用数学课；让农村卫生员讲卫生知识课。这些同志讲课紧密结合三大革命运动实际，深刻生动，通俗易懂，使学生学到很多在书本上学不到的东西。贫下中农开进学校，登上讲台，充实了教师队伍，改变了教师的阶级成份，从根本上夺回了教育大权，结束了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象。为了加强对教师队伍的改造，还组织革命教师同学生一道与贫下中农参加三大革命运动，走与贫下中农相结合的道路，彻底使他们改变过去从资产阶级教育中接受的资产阶级教育思想。
    四、实行了一元化的普及教育——为贫下中农子女入学大开方便之门
    过去贫下中农子女上学有种种关卡，什么小学、完小、中学；学费关、考试升级关、入学年龄关等等，把广大贫下中农子女拒之于学校大门之外。贫下中农管理学校，砸碎了这些条条、框框，为贫下中农子女入学大开方便之门。据三个大队的调查，他们采取三种办法解决贫下中农子女入学问题：（1）小学附设初中班，念中学不出屯；（2）减轻贫下中农负担，学生免收学杂费，特殊困难户子女上学，由生产队公益金补助，开展群众性的互助活动，贫下中农自愿积钱，给生活困难的贫下中农孩子买衣服、鞋帽；（3）废除了束缚贫下中农子女上学的旧规章制度，如入学、升学考试，小学六年制、初中三年制，实行了七年一贯制，使适龄青少年全部入学。拉腰子生产大队还把十八名学龄前儿童组织起来，每天上两节课，把学龄前儿童教育也纳入到学校教育中来。一元化的普及教育，受到了广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
    五、组成了一个班子——以贫下中农为主体的教育革命领导小组
    这三个大队，在去年十一月成立了有大队革委会负责人、贫下中农代表、民兵连长、革命师生代表组成的无产阶级教育革命领导小组，保证了农村教育大权牢牢地掌握在贫下中农手里。大队革命委员会把管理学校的工作纳入议事日程上来，定期讨论研究学校的工作，革委会负责人亲自坐阵领导，把学校当成大队的一个生产队，一个民兵排。改变了过去那种学校和生产队“鸡犬之声相闻，老死不相往来”的关系。师生们说：“生产队是咱们的生产队。”贫下中农说：“学校是咱们的学校。”
