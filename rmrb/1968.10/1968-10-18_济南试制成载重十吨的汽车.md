In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Factory have recently successfully trialed a "Huanghe" brand ten-ton load-carrying vehicle. This is yet another new product following their successful creation of a large-tonnage off-road vehicle with world-advanced standards. To date, this factory has successfully trialed four types of vehicles during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making significant contributions to China's transportation industry.

    济南试制成载重十吨的汽车
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，济南汽车制造总厂的革命职工最近试制成功了载重量为十吨的
  “黄河”牌载重汽车。这是他们在制成具有世界先进水平的大吨位越野汽车之后的又一新产品。到目前为止，这个厂在无产阶级文化大革命中已经先后试制成功了四种汽车，为我国交通运输事业作出了很大贡献。
