	Unshakable Truth
	—After Watching the Feature Documentary "Navigating the Sea Relies on the Helmsman"

	"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." This is a great truth repeatedly proven by the practice of the proletarian revolution. The feature documentary "Navigating the Sea Relies on the Helmsman," which records the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Navy, vividly tells the story of Navy soldiers growing up by earnestly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It fully elucidates this unshakable truth.

	Over the past nineteen years, the people's Navy has grown and prospered under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The heroes and advanced collectives in the Navy depicted in the film are exemplary in following the great helmsman Chairman Mao, earnestly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and combining learning with practice, focusing on application. They are models of integrating theory with practice.

	Combat hero Mai Xiande loves Chairman Mao the most. He firmly executes and follows Chairman Mao's instructions under any circumstances. With his boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, he created astonishing heroic feats in battle and is a model of selflessness in peacetime.

	The Party Committee of the 441st Unit earnestly studies Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, and analyze everything. With an unshakable belief in Mao Zedong Thought, they fearlessly fought against and resisted attacks and persecution in the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines. They bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Truly, "In the face of great winds and waves, their spirits soar high; under immense pressure, they stand unshaken. Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, a red flag flies over the South China Sea."

	Zhang Yimin, who has made numerous contributions in battle, studies Chairman Mao's works word by word and sentence by sentence. He guides his actions with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly upholds proletarian politics, and uses the strategies and tactics of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. In battle, he fights bravely and flexibly, showcasing the might of torpedo boats at sea.

	These are true and vivid depictions of "making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." These heroes and advanced collectives stand in sharp contrast to those who merely pay lip service to relying on Mao Zedong Thought but do not genuinely follow it, instead acting according to their personal will.

	Whether one truly relies on Mao Zedong Thought or merely pays lip service to it is the touchstone for distinguishing true revolutionaries from false ones. If one does not earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, does not resolutely implement it, or if one's words and deeds do not align, one will make mistakes and take the wrong path, slipping into the wrong direction. We must learn from heroes like Mai Xiande, studying Mao Zedong Thought without letting up for a moment, implementing it without deviation in word and deed, and defending it without the slightest waver. We must establish a good study style of integrating theory with practice, truly achieving the goal of making revolution relying on Mao Zedong Thought.

	In the favorable situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the feature documentary "Navigating the Sea Relies on the Helmsman" is being released. The screening of this film will undoubtedly inspire hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians to better follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao, unconditionally execute Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unify understanding, policy, steps, and actions, and march from victory to victory!

    颠扑不破的真理
    ——大型纪录片《大海航行靠舵手》观后
    丁正和
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”这是为无产阶级革命实践反复证明了的伟大真理。记述海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的大型纪录片《大海航行靠舵手》，以海军战士活学活用毛主席著作茁壮成长的真实动人的故事，充分阐明了这一颠扑不破的真理。
    十九年来，人民海军就是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下成长壮大起来的。影片中所记述的海军英雄人物和先进集体，就是紧跟伟大舵手毛主席，活学活用毛主席著作，学用结合，在用字上狠下功夫的典范。
    战斗英雄麦贤得最最热爱毛主席。只要是毛主席的教导，无论在什么情况下，他都坚决执行，一一照办。凭着他无限忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想的一颗红心，战时他创造了惊天动地的英雄业绩，平时他是破私立公的好榜样。
    四四一一部队党委认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，分析一切。凭着对毛泽东思想的坚定不移的信念，他们在两个阶级、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，不怕打击，不怕迫害，敢于斗争，坚持斗争，勇敢地捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。真是“风大浪险斗志高，压力如山不动摇。永远忠于毛主席，一杆红旗南海飘。”
    累建战功的张逸民同志逐字逐句地刻苦学习毛主席著作，处处用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动，坚决突出无产阶级政治，坚持运用毛主席和林副主席的战略战术，战斗中英勇顽强，灵活机动，杀出了鱼雷快艇的海上威风。
    这些都是“干革命靠毛泽东思想”的真实而生动的写照。这些英雄人物和先进集体，同那些口头上说干革命靠毛泽东思想而实际上不认真按照毛泽东思想办事，而凭个人思想意志行事的人是个鲜明的对比。
    干革命靠不靠毛泽东思想，是真靠毛泽东思想，还是口头上靠毛泽东思想，是区分真革命、不革命和假革命的试金石。如果学习毛泽东思想不认真，贯彻毛泽东思想不坚决，或者言行不一，表里不一，那就会伸手做错事，抬腿走错路，滑到邪路上去。我们要学习麦贤得等英雄人物，象他们那样，学习毛泽东思想一时一刻不松劲，贯彻毛泽东思想一言一行不走样，捍卫毛泽东思想一丝一毫不动摇，树立理论和实际相结合的好学风，真正做到干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，大型纪录片《大海航行靠舵手》公映了。这部影片的上映，必将激励着亿万军民更好地紧跟伟大舵手毛主席，不折不扣地执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下统一认识，统一政策，统一步伐，统一行动，从胜利走向胜利！
