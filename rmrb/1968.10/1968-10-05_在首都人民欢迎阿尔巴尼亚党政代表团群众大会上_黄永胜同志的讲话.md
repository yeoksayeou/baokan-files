	Dear Comrade Bekir Balluku, dear members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, comrades and fellow fighters:

	Today, workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, members of the revolutionary committees of various organs, revolutionary cultural warriors, Red Guards, and representatives of workers and model soldiers from all over the country, as well as soldiers participating in the National Day activities, have gathered here to hold a grand meeting. We express our deepest proletarian revolutionary friendship to the delegation led by Comrade Bekir Balluku, who have come from the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, and extend to them our warmest welcome.

	The heroic Albanian people are the closest comrades of the Chinese people. During our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have continuously received the enthusiastic support of the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party led by the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha. Not long ago, when revolutionary committees were established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of our country except Taiwan, the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Muhafiz Shehu sent us a warm telegram congratulating our great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai. On the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Albanian leaders sent another telegram congratulating our National Day and highly praising our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They also sent such an important party and government delegation to celebrate our glorious national holiday with us. At the National Day reception held at our embassy in Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha delivered a very enthusiastic and illuminating speech full of Marxist-Leninist brilliance. All these are great encouragement and support for the Chinese people who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On behalf of the 700 million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I express our deepest gratitude and highest respect to the fraternal Albanian people and the Albanian People's Army.

	The Albanian people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, have, under the wise leadership of the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, fearlessly and bravely fought against domestic and foreign enemies for a long time. As Comrade Enver Hoxha said, the path the Albanian people have taken is "a path of struggle against open and disguised vicious enemies at home and abroad, a path opened by the people with their chests, high political sensitivity and maturity, pens, guns in their hands, blood, and countless sacrifices." During World War II, the Albanian people relied on their own strength, persisted in armed struggle, defeated the vicious fascist invaders of Germany and Italy, and established a people's government. After the war, they repeatedly foiled the subversive and sabotage plots of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, defending proletarian dictatorship. When the Khrushchev revisionist traitor clique launched a frenzied attack on Marxism-Leninism, the Albanian Labor Party, under the leadership of its great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, stood firm on principles, bravely resisted the current, fought against the waves, and engaged in a head-on struggle with Khrushchev revisionism. They bravely defended Marxism-Leninism and made outstanding contributions to the international communist movement and the world proletarian revolutionary cause.

	The glorious Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have always adhered to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism. Following Comrade Enver Hoxha's teaching of "building socialism with one hand holding a hoe and the other holding a gun," they have relied on their own efforts and struggled hard. They have achieved brilliant successes in socialist revolution and socialist construction. In recent years, the Albanian Labor Party has launched a profound socialist revolutionary movement to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration. Under the guidance of the Marxist-Leninist struggle program adopted at the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, the revolutionary movement has flourished and reached a new, magnificent high tide. This year, Comrade Enver Hoxha proposed the task of educational revolution, calling for further revolutionizing schools, cultivating new communist people, advocating worker supervision to prevent cadre degeneration, and playing the role of the master of the working class. This has further enriched the content of the revolutionary movement, making it develop more deeply and broadly. The revolutionary movement has greatly consolidated and strengthened proletarian dictatorship, greatly promoted the communist spirit of the Albanian people, and powerfully promoted the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. Today, Albania is stronger than ever. The light of this great socialist beacon in Europe shines more brilliantly than ever. This is a great victory achieved by the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha in creatively combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Albanian revolution.

	The glorious Albanian Labor Party and the heroic Albanian people have always held high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. They have always been at the forefront of the struggle. The Albanian people firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end. They firmly support the struggle of the Arab people against American and Israeli aggression. They firmly support the struggle of the Czechoslovak and Eastern European peoples against the modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. They firmly support the revolutionary mass movements in Western Europe and North America. They firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian people have fully played the role of a strong shock brigade of the international proletariat and the world revolutionary people, winning the high praise and boundless admiration of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world.

	Recently, the People's Republic of Albania solemnly announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. Comrade Shehu's report to the Albanian People's Assembly, with a large number of irrefutable facts, exposed that the Warsaw Pact, which was originally a means of defending against imperialist aggression, has become a tool of socialist aggression. The great revolutionary action taken by the Albanian people is another heavy blow to the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists. It is a great support for the struggle of the peoples of Eastern European countries against the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. It is a new and significant contribution to the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Europe and the world.

	Not long ago, the Soviet revisionist Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique, under the banner of the Warsaw Pact, rallied its Eastern European partners, the Gomulka clique, the Ulbricht clique, the Zhivkov clique, and the Kadar clique, and brazenly sent troops to occupy Czechoslovakia, committing heinous crimes against the Czechoslovak people. The Czechoslovak revisionist leadership surrendered to the invaders and shamefully betrayed the Czechoslovak people. The naked aggression of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique fully exposed that it had long betrayed Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevik Party, betrayed the socialist cause, and betrayed the Soviet people. It fully exposed its socialist imperialist and socialist fascist ugly face. Under the banner of the "socialist family," the Soviet revisionists used the Warsaw Pact and another tool they controlled, the CMEA, to push a policy of neo-colonialism in Eastern European countries: politically, they trampled on the independence and sovereignty of Eastern European countries and rudely interfered in their domestic and foreign policies; economically, they plundered the resources of these countries and exploited the working people of these countries; militarily, they threatened with force, armed control, and even openly sent troops to occupy, using guns to create puppets. Just as the American imperialists control Western European countries through NATO, the Soviet revisionists control Eastern European countries through the Warsaw Pact. The relationship between the Soviet revisionists and the Eastern European revisionist countries is exactly the same as that between the American imperialists and the Latin American reactionary ruling countries. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is the greatest colonial ruler and exploiter of the peoples of Eastern European countries, the greatest exploiter, and the new tsar riding on the heads of the peoples of Eastern European countries. Their so-called "socialist family" is actually a relationship of colonialism between a master country and a dependent country.

	The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia also fully exposed that the Warsaw Pact is a tool used by the Soviet revisionists to engage in counter-revolutionary deals with American imperialism and to push for American-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. A large number of facts show that the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are competing and colluding with each other, attempting to divide spheres of influence, re-divide the world, and suppress the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries. The American imperialists tacitly allowed the Soviet revisionists to invade Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet revisionists tacitly allowed the American imperialists to invade Vietnam. The American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists collude to jointly sabotage the just struggle of the Arab people against American and Israeli aggression, plotting to sell out the interests of the Arab people. The American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists are the most vicious enemies of the peoples of the world.

	The heroic Albanian people despise the seemingly powerful and vicious enemy of the Soviet revisionists and resolutely withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. When Albania took this revolutionary action, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Muhafiz Shehu, representing the 700 million Chinese people, expressing their most resolute support for the Albanian people. Recently, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has been stepping up its plots against Albania, using the Warsaw Pact to mass troops in Bulgaria and control Bulgaria, seriously threatening the security of the Albanian and Balkan peoples. At the same time, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has also increased its troops along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian borders and intensified its armed provocations against China. All these do not show its strength but only its weakness. Chairman Mao said in his telegram to the Albanian leaders: "If the American imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, what awaits them is only a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure."

	Here, we assure our Albanian comrades that the 700 million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will always, under any circumstances, stand firmly on the side of the fraternal Albanian people, fight together with the heroic Albanian people and the brave Albanian People's Army, and win together.

	At present, we are facing a great international situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. The forces of Marxism-Leninism are continuously developing, the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, the revolutionary mass movements in Western Europe and North America are rising, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples under the rule of modern revisionism are rising. A new historical period of opposing American imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun. The imperialists led by the United States are in trouble both internally and externally. The modern revisionist group led by the Soviet revisionists is in disarray and disintegrating. Their days are getting worse. The day to thoroughly bury imperialism and revisionism is not far off.

	Comrades and fellow fighters!

	At present, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, our people are advancing bravely along the direction indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The revolutionary masses of the Chinese proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, have taken back the power in the party, government, finance, and culture that had been usurped by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, represented by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in various places. Revolutionary committees of the three-in-one combination have been established in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of the country except Taiwan. A new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation is being widely carried out throughout the country. The Chinese working class, following the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, has formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and, together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, is marching into primary, secondary, and tertiary schools in a grand manner. They are also entering various fields of the superstructure and joining forces with the revolutionary activists there to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation and execute the great historical mission of "the working class must lead everything." Wherever the workers' propaganda teams go, the whole situation is transformed, making the places where intellectuals gather in our superstructure undergo and continue to undergo profound revolutionary changes.

	The situation is excellent and inspiring. After more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, great Mao Zedong Thought has never been as widely spread as it is today, the spiritual face of the people of the whole country has never been as full of vitality as it is today, our proletarian dictatorship has never been as consolidated as it is today, and our socialist motherland has never been as strong as it is today. A new leap forward in socialist construction is about to appear. This is the great victory of all the ethnic groups of our country, who are closely united around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and who have fought bravely! This is the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! These victories have thoroughly foiled the imperialists' and modern revisionists' plot to restore capitalism in China; these victories have made it possible for our country to make greater contributions to the world revolution and better fulfill its proletarian internationalist duties.

	Comrades and fellow fighters:

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The two parties and the peoples of China and Albania have forged a deep revolutionary friendship in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction and in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. This friendship is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and is eternal and unbreakable." In the stormy struggle together, our unity and friendship have already shown and will continue to show an invincible power. Let us, the two parties, the two peoples, and the two armies of China and Albania, fight shoulder to shoulder, advance hand in hand, and strive for our common great goal of thoroughly burying imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries and building a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without the system of exploitation!

	Finally, let us shout:

	Down with American imperialism!

	Down with Soviet revisionism!

	Down with the reactionaries of all countries who follow American imperialism and Soviet revisionism!

	Long live the revolutionary friendship between the two parties, the two peoples, and the two armies of China and Albania!

	Long live the heroic Albanian people!

	Long live the powerful Albanian People's Army!

	Long live the glorious Albanian Labor Party!

	Long live the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!

	Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

    在首都人民欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团群众大会上
    黄永胜同志的讲话
    新华社四日讯　黄永胜同志在首都人民欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团群众大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的贝基尔·巴卢库同志，亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志们，战友们，同志们：
    今天，我们首都工人、农民、解放军战士、机关革命大联合委员会成员、革命文艺战士、红卫兵小将和来自全国各地的工人代表、解放军英模代表，以及参加国庆活动的解放军指战员，在这里隆重集会，以无比深厚的无产阶级战斗情谊，向来自反帝、反修斗争前线的以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的同志们，表示最热烈的欢迎。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民是中国人民最亲密的战友。我国人民在无产阶级文化大革命的过程中，不断得到以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的热情支持。不久以前，当我国除台湾省以外的二十九个省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志和部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志，给我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及周恩来总理发来了热情洋溢的贺电。在中华人民共和国成立十九周年的时候，阿尔巴尼亚领导人又发来了热烈祝贺我国国庆和高度赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命的贺电，并且派遣了这样重要的党政代表团同我们一起欢度我国的光辉节日。在我国驻阿尔巴尼亚使馆举行的国庆招待会上，恩维尔·霍查同志作了极为热情的、闪耀着马克思列宁主义光辉思想的重要讲话。所有这一切，都是对正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民的巨大鼓舞、巨大支持。让我代表七亿中国人民和中国人民解放军向兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军，表示最衷心的感谢和最崇高的敬意。
    具有光荣革命传统的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，不畏强暴，勇往直前，同国内外敌人进行了长期的英勇斗争。正如恩维尔·霍查同志所说，阿尔巴尼亚人民所走过的道路，是一条“同国内外公开的、伪装的凶恶敌人搏斗的道路，是人民以胸膛、以高度政治敏感和成熟性、以笔杆、以手中的枪、以鲜血和无数的牺牲所开辟的道路。”在第二次世界大战期间，阿尔巴尼亚人民依靠自己的力量，坚持武装斗争，战胜了凶恶的德意法西斯侵略者，建立了人民政权。战后，他们不断地粉碎了帝、修、反的颠覆和破坏阴谋，保卫了无产阶级专政。当赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团，向马克思列宁主义发动猖狂进攻的时候，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在其伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，坚持原则，挺身而出，顶逆流，战恶浪，同赫鲁晓夫修正主义进行了针锋相对的斗争，英勇地捍卫了马克思列宁主义，对国际共产主义运动和世界无产阶级革命事业，作出了卓越的贡献。
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，一贯坚持马克思列宁主义的革命路线，遵照恩维尔·霍查同志“一手拿镐，一手拿枪建设社会主义”的教导，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了辉煌的成就。近几年来，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为了巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，开展了具有深刻的社会主义革命意义的革命化运动。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会所制定的马克思列宁主义斗争纲领的指引下，革命化运动蓬勃发展，出现了一个波澜壮阔的新高潮。今年，恩维尔·霍查同志又提出了进行教育革命的任务，号召学校进一步革命化，造就共产主义新人，提出了工人阶级监督的主张，防止干部蜕化变质，发挥工人阶级主人翁的作用，从而进一步丰富了革命化运动的内容，使这一运动更加深入、更加广泛地向前发展。革命化运动，大大地巩固和加强了无产阶级专政，使阿尔巴尼亚人民共产主义精神大为发扬，有力地推动了工农业生产的迅速发展。今天，阿尔巴尼亚比以往任何时候都更加坚强。阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲的伟大的社会主义明灯放射出的光芒，比以往任何时候都更加灿烂。这是以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同阿尔巴尼亚革命的具体实践相结合的伟大胜利。
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在反帝、反修、反对各国反动派的斗争中，始终高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的革命大旗，站在斗争的最前列。阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对美、以侵略的斗争，坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民和东欧各国人民反对以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义的斗争，坚决支持西欧、北美的革命群众运动，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，充分发挥了国际无产阶级和世界革命人民的坚强突击队的作用，赢得了中国人民和全世界革命人民的高度赞扬和无限钦佩。
    最近，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国庄严宣布退出华沙条约。谢胡同志在阿尔巴尼亚人民议会上作的报告，以大量的无可辩驳的事实，揭露了华沙条约已从一个防御帝国主义侵略的手段，变为侵略性的反社会主义的工具。阿尔巴尼亚人民采取的这一大无畏的革命行动，是对美帝和苏修的又一次沉重打击，是对东欧各国人民反对苏修叛徒集团的斗争的巨大支持，是对欧洲和全世界人民的革命斗争的新的重大贡献。
    不久以前，苏修勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团打着华沙条约的旗号，纠集其东欧伙伴哥穆尔卡集团、乌布利希集团、日夫科夫集团、卡达尔集团，悍然出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，对捷克斯洛伐克人民犯下了滔天罪行。捷克斯洛伐克修正主义领导集团，在侵略者面前屈膝投降，可耻地背叛了捷克斯洛伐克人民。苏修叛徒集团的这一赤裸裸的侵略行为，充分暴露了它早已背叛了列宁、斯大林的布尔什维克党，背叛了社会主义事业，背叛了苏联人民，充分暴露了它的社会帝国主义和社会法西斯主义的狰狞面目。苏修叛徒集团打着“社会主义大家庭”的幌子，利用华沙条约和它所控制的另一个工具经互会，对东欧国家全面推行新殖民主义政策：在政治上肆意践踏东欧国家的独立和主权，粗暴干预这些国家的内外政策；在经济上掠夺这些国家的资源，剥削这些国家的劳动人民；在军事上进行武力威胁、武装控制，以至公然出兵占领，用枪炮制造傀儡。正如美帝通过北大西洋公约控制西欧国家一样，苏修通过华沙条约控制东欧国家。苏修和东欧修正主义国家的关系，同美帝和拉美反动统治国家的关系一模一样。苏修叛徒集团是东欧各国人民最大的殖民统治者，最大的剥削者，是骑在东欧各国人民头上的新沙皇。他们所谓的“社会主义大家庭”，实际上是沙皇式的宗主国和附属国的关系。
    苏修侵捷事件，还充分暴露了华沙条约是苏修用来同美帝进行反革命交易、推行美苏合作主宰世界的工具。大量事实说明，美帝、苏修互相争夺而又互相勾结，妄图划分势力范围，重新瓜分世界，镇压各国人民革命运动。美帝默许苏修放手侵略捷克斯洛伐克，苏修默许美帝放手侵略越南。美帝、苏修互相勾结，合伙破坏阿拉伯人民反对美、以侵略的正义斗争，阴谋出卖阿拉伯人民的利益。美帝和苏修是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民蔑视苏修这个貌似强大的凶恶敌人，毅然决然退出了华沙条约。当阿尔巴尼亚采取这一革命行动的时候，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及周恩来总理，打电报给阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志和部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志，代表七亿中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民表示了最坚决的支持。最近，苏修叛徒集团加紧策划反阿阴谋，利用华沙条约，陈兵保加利亚，控制保加利亚，严重地威胁阿尔巴尼亚和巴尔干各国人民的安全。与此同时，苏修叛徒集团还在中苏、中蒙边境增驻大量军队，加紧对中国进行武装挑衅。凡此种种，绝不表明它的强大，而只表明它的虚弱。毛主席在给阿尔巴尼亚领导人的电报中说：“如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。”
    我们在这里向阿尔巴尼亚同志们保证，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民和中国人民解放军，一定遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，“在任何时候、任何情况下，都将始终如一地站在兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一边”，同英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    目前，我们正面临一片东风压倒西风的大好国际形势。马克思列宁主义的力量不断发展，亚非拉民族解放运动日益高涨，西欧、北美各国革命群众运动风起云涌，现代修正主义统治下的各国人民的革命斗争正在兴起。一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经开始。以美帝为首的帝国主义内外交困，危机四伏。以苏修为首的现代修正主义集团互相倾轧，分崩离析。他们的日子越来越不好过。彻底埋葬帝国主义和修正主义的日子，已经为期不远了。
    同志们，战友们！
    目前，我国人民在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，正在沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利奋勇前进。                              
    我国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在中共中央、中央文革的领导下把以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人所篡夺的那一部分党、政、财、文大权，夺回来了。三结合的革命委员会，在全国除台湾省以外的二十九个省、市、自治区已经全部建立起来了。一个斗、批、改的新高潮，正在全国范围内广泛地开展起来。中国工人阶级，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，配合人民解放军战士，浩浩荡荡地开进了大、中、小学校，并且正在开到上层建筑的各个领域中去，同那里的革命积极分子结合起来，领导那里的斗、批、改，执行“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大历史使命。工人宣传队所到之处，整个面貌，焕然一新，使我国上层建筑中知识分子成堆的地方，发生了并将继续发生深刻的革命变化。
    形势大好，振奋人心。经过两年多的无产阶级文化大革命，在我国，伟大的毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样广泛普及，全国人民的精神面貌从来没有象今天这样生气勃勃，我国的无产阶级专政从来没有象今天这样巩固，我们的社会主义祖国从来没有象今天这样强大。一个社会主义建设的新的跃进局面，已经预见要出现了。这是我国各族人民紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，英勇奋斗的伟大胜利！这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！这些胜利，使帝国主义、现代修正主义妄图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，遭到了彻底的破产；这些胜利，使我国有可能为世界革命做出更大的贡献，更好地履行自己的无产阶级国际主义的义务。
    同志们，战友们：
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“中阿两党、两国人民，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，结成了深厚的革命友谊。这种友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的，是永恒的、牢不可破的。”在共同斗争的急风暴雨中，我们的团结和友谊已经显示了、并将继续显示出无比强大的威力。让我们中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队并肩战斗，携手前进，为实现我们共同的伟大目标，彻底埋葬帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，建立一个没有帝国主义，没有资本主义，没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗！
    最后，让我们高呼：
    打倒美帝！
    打倒苏修！
    打倒紧随美帝、苏修的各国反动派！
    中阿两党、两国人民和两国军队之间的革命友谊万岁！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    强大的阿尔巴尼亚人民军万岁！
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
