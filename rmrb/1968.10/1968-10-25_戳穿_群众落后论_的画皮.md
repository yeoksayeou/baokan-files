Mao Zedong's revolutionary line is the most thorough mass line. Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses." This is the consistent teaching of our great leader Mao Zedong and a major development in Mao Zedong's theory of party building.

The Chinese Khrushchev, this great traitor, great internal enemy, and great saboteur, has always opposed Mao Zedong Thought, maliciously slandering and defaming the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, and spreading the reactionary fallacy of the "masses are backward." This reactionary fallacy must be thoroughly criticized.

The working class is "the leading force of our revolution," and the poor and lower-middle peasants are "the most reliable allies of the working class." However, the Chinese Khrushchev maliciously slanders the Chinese working class as having "low class consciousness," claiming that "if a worker is no good, just say he is no good." This is a blatant exposure of his counter-revolutionary stance and a confession of his enmity and hatred towards the working masses.

The Chinese Khrushchev's spreading of the "masses are backward" theory has a very sinister purpose.

The "masses are backward" theory is a roadblock preventing the party from recruiting new blood from the worker and peasant masses. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents are accustomed to distorting right and wrong, spreading rumors and slanders, and arbitrarily labeling large numbers of advanced elements with proletarian revolutionary spirit among the worker and peasant masses as "backward elements," using every means to suppress them and keep them out of the party.

The "masses are backward" theory is a cover for the Chinese Khrushchev's policy of surrender and betrayal. On the one hand, he slanders the worker and peasant masses as "backward," and on the other hand, he spreads the myth that "capitalists are very progressive," claiming that becoming a traitor is just "a momentary lapse." He uses this two-pronged despicable method to both reject advanced elements from the worker and peasant masses joining the party and to bring a small number of traitors, spies, and class enemies into the party, plotting to make the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party degenerate and change in nature.

The "masses are backward" theory is a tight rein to suppress the masses' revolution. Whenever someone within the party dares to resist and oppose a small handful of capitalist roaders, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents pull out this reactionary fallacy, labeling them as "backward elements" and imposing bourgeois dictatorship on the masses.

The "masses are backward" theory is a club to suppress mass movements. The Chinese Khrushchev keeps shouting that mass movements are bad in this way and that way, completely denying that mass movements are naturally reasonable. He strives to boost the morale of the bourgeoisie and suppress the morale of the proletariat, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion to abolish and suppress mass movements.

The "masses are backward" theory is also a malignant corrosive agent that damages party-mass relations. It induces party members to detach themselves from the masses, isolating the party from the masses, fundamentally undermining the party's mass line, and attempting to turn the party from the vanguard of the proletariat into a fascist party that detaches itself from and suppresses the masses.

In a word, the Chinese Khrushchev's concoction of the "masses are backward" theory is for the purpose of usurping the party, suppressing the masses, and restoring capitalism. However, those who oppose the worker and peasant masses have never had a good ending. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already swept the Chinese Khrushchev into the dustbin of history.

The attitude towards the worker and peasant masses has always been the touchstone of revolution and counter-revolution. Our great leader Mao Zedong profoundly pointed out: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." The Chinese Khrushchev, who maliciously slanders the masses as backward, is a Kuomintang member who has infiltrated the Communist Party, an agent of imperialism and the bourgeoisie.

"Maintaining close ties with the people" is one of the party's three major styles and also the fundamental guarantee for the party to maintain its revolutionary youth. Let us wield the mighty weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev's "masses are backward" theory, firmly believe in the revolutionary masses, and more closely rely directly on the revolutionary masses. Let us "renew and reform," do a good job in party building, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    戳穿“群众落后论”的画皮
    群向阳
    毛主席的革命路线，就是最彻底的群众路线。毛主席最近指出：“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们的一贯教导，也是毛主席的党的建设理论的重大发展。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼，为了篡党和复辟资本主义，一贯反对毛泽东思想，百般污蔑和丑化广大工人和贫下中农，大肆散布“群众落后论”。对于这种反动谬论，必须彻底批判。
    工人阶级“是我们革命的领导力量”，贫下中农是“工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者”。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却恶毒污蔑中国工人阶级“其阶级觉悟不高”，胡说什么“工人不好就说不好”。这是他反革命立场的大暴露，是他敌视和仇恨工人群众的自白书。
    中国赫鲁晓夫大肆散布“群众落后论”，具有十分阴险的目的。
    “群众落后论”，是阻挠党从工农群众中吸收新鲜血液的拦路虎。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，惯于颠倒黑白，造谣污蔑，硬把工农群众中大批具有无产阶级革命精神的先进分子，说成是“落后分子”，千方百计地打击他们，把他们关在党的大门之外。
    “群众落后论”，是中国赫鲁晓夫招降纳叛的遮羞布。他一面污蔑工农群众“落后”，一面又散布资本家“很进步”的神话，胡说什么当叛徒只是“一念之差”。他就是用这样双管齐下的卑鄙手法，既拒绝工农群众中先进分子入党，又把一小撮叛徒、特务、阶级异己分子拉入党内，阴谋使伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党蜕化变质。
    “群众落后论”，是压制群众革命的紧箍咒。凡是对党内一小撮走资派敢于抵制、敢于反抗的，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人就抬出这种反动谬论，给他扣上一顶“落后分子”的帽子，对群众实行资产阶级专政。
    “群众落后论”，是镇压群众运动的狼牙棒。中国赫鲁晓夫一个劲地叫嚷群众运动这也不好，那也不行，根本否认群众运动是天然合理的。他拚命长资产阶级志气，灭无产阶级威风，为取消和镇压群众运动制造反革命舆论。
    “群众落后论”，又是破坏党群关系的恶性腐蚀剂。它诱使党员脱离群众，把党和群众隔绝开来，从根本上破坏党的群众路线，妄想把党从无产阶级先锋队蜕变成脱离群众、压制群众的法西斯党。
    一句话，中国赫鲁晓夫炮制“群众落后论”，就是为了篡党，就是为了镇压群众，就是为了复辟资本主义。但是，和工农群众为敌的人，从来都没有好下场。无产阶级文化大革命早已把中国赫鲁晓夫扫进了历史的垃圾堆。
    对待工农群众的态度，从来就是革命和反革命的试金石。伟大领袖毛主席极其深刻地指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”大肆污蔑群众落后的中国赫鲁晓夫，就是钻进共产党内的国民党，是帝国主义和资产阶级的代理人。
    “和人民群众紧密地联系在一起”，是党的三大作风之一，也是我们党永葆革命青春的根本保证。让我们奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的“群众落后论”，更坚定地相信革命群众，更紧密地直接依靠革命群众，“吐故纳新”，搞好整党建党，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
