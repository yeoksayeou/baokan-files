	Put Revolutionary Interests First

	The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai South Railway Station, member and Communist Party member Wang Yinzhi, always puts revolutionary interests first and goes wherever there are difficulties. Workers praise him, saying, "We trust such a worker representative!"

	Wang Yinzhi was originally a dispatcher at the station. After being elected to the Revolutionary Committee, he always remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "being both an official and a common person." Some people wanted him to leave his job, but he insisted on working shifts. He said, "I am a representative of the worker masses and cannot be separated from the worker masses!" Wherever there are difficulties, he goes there; once he arrives, he studies Chairman Mao's works with the masses, propagates Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, and fights with the masses.

	One morning, the dispatcher at South Station received a call from the front station at Longhua saying that due to being too busy, the morning 8 o'clock freight train could not enter the station and had to be sent in with the 11 o'clock train. This caused the dispatcher to panic. If two freight trains arrive at the same time, the station's manpower will not be enough, and the materials waiting to be transported will also be affected, disrupting the entire transportation plan. What should be done? The dispatcher felt very anxious. Wang Yinzhi heard about this and said, "Since they are too busy, we will go and bring the train in ourselves." The dispatcher had reservations, saying, "This has never been done before. If we start now, there will be more trouble in the future." Wang Yinzhi said, "As long as it is beneficial to the revolution, no matter how troublesome it is, we must do it!" He discussed this with the locomotive shunting team and everyone agreed with this approach. Wang Yinzhi personally led a few comrades to Longhua Station and took the lead in helping them with the shunting. He was not afraid of difficulties or hard work and quickly sent a freight train into South Station, ensuring the completion of the transportation task. Comrades said: Old Wang always thinks of revolutionary interests and is a good example for us to learn from.

	In May of this year, Wang Yinzhi was elected by all the workers at the station to participate in the National Railway and Transportation Conference in Beijing and was warmly received by the great leader Chairman Mao. After returning from Beijing, he devoted his whole heart to the work at the station. All the workers at the station generally praised him, saying: Our worker representative is truly excellent!

    把革命利益放在第一位
    铁路局上海南站革委会委员、共产党员王银芝，处处为革命利益着想，那里有困难就往那里跑。工人们赞扬说：“这样的工人委员我们信得过！”
    王银芝原是站里的一班调度员，被选入革委会后，始终牢记毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的伟大教导。有的人要他脱产，但他坚持当班。他说：“我是工人群众的代表，不能脱离工人群众！”那里有困难，他就往那里跑；到了那里，就同那里的群众一起学习毛主席著作，向群众宣传毛泽东思想，同群众一起战斗。
    一天早晨，南站调度员接到前方龙华站来电话说：因忙不过来，早晨八点钟的货车进不了站，要同十一点钟的列车一齐送进来。这一来，调度员可急坏了。两班货车一齐到，站里的劳动力跟不上去，等待外运的物资也受到影响，整个运输计划就会打乱，怎么办？调度员感到很着急。王银芝知道了这件事，就说：“他们忙不过来，我们自己去把列车接进来。”调度员有顾虑，说：“过去从来没有这样做过。现在开个头，以后麻烦就多了。”王银芝说：“只要对革命有利，再麻烦我们也要顶着干！”他和机车调车组的同志一谈，大家都同意这个做法。王银芝亲自带了几个同志赶到前方龙华站，带头帮助他们调车。他不怕难，不怕累，很快地把一列货车送进了南站，保证了运输任务的完成。同志们说：老王处处想着革命利益，是我们学习的好榜样。
    今年五月，王银芝被全站职工推选到北京参加全国铁路、交通会议，受到了伟大领袖毛主席的亲切接见。从北京回来以后，他更是把整个身心都放在站里的工作上，全站职工普遍赞扬说：我们的工人委员就是好！
