In the foothills of the Himalayas, there is a remote mountain village called Gongna. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, a half-farm, half-study primary school managed by former serfs was established in April 1963.

The former serfs in this area were, in the old society, generation after generation, slaves to the three great lords, with no personal freedom, let alone the opportunity to read and write. The soldiers of the border defense units believed that not only should the Tibetan compatriots be liberated politically and economically, but they must also be helped to be liberated culturally. Therefore, they followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," and helped the masses establish a half-farm, half-study primary school. To run the school well, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army personally helped formulate the teaching plan, using Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, with officers and soldiers from the army tutoring the students; they also hired former serfs to teach the students about class struggle and production struggle. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, the students not only improved their cultural knowledge but, more importantly, heightened their class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines. To date, many students can recite fluently the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations. They can apply what they learn to practice, following Chairman Mao's instructions in everything they do. After studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," they established the idea of mutual concern, mutual love, and mutual help, making the entire school a united and friendly fighting collective. When the students return home from school, they become the tutors for their parents in studying Chairman Mao's works. The students also actively participate in productive labor, help the former serfs do good deeds, and are warmly praised by the masses. The students also help the People's Liberation Army guard the borders.

The students of this school, through studying Chairman Mao's works, love the great leader Chairman Mao even more. They report to Chairman Mao every day, determined to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and become successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

The students study while working, and year after year, they have achieved bountiful labor results. Last year, they harvested tens of thousands of pounds of various vegetables and more than a hundred kangs (each kang is 25 pounds) of highland barley. Chalk and abacuses are all made by themselves. Through frequently participating in labor, the students have cultivated a good habit of loving labor from a young age. Over the years, more than thirty students have graduated from this school. Some have become accountants and medical workers in the countryside, while others have become the first generation of workers in Tibet.

    翻身农奴管理小学成绩显著
    喜马拉雅山麓共那村翻身农奴，在解放军帮助下，开办半耕半读小学，坚持理论联系实际，培养出一批深受群众欢迎的学生
    据新华社拉萨二十九日电　在喜马拉雅山麓，有一个叫共那的偏僻山村，在人民解放军指战员的帮助下，于一九六三年四月办起了一所由翻身贫苦农奴管理的半耕半读小学。
    这个地方的翻身农奴，在旧社会祖祖辈辈给三大领主作牛马，没有人身自由，更谈不上读书识字了。边防部队的指战员们认为，不但要使藏族同胞在政治上、经济上翻身，在文化上也必须帮助他们彻底翻身。于是，他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教导，帮助群众办起一所半耕半读小学。为了把学校办好，解放军指战员亲自帮助制定教学计划，以毛主席著作为基本教材，由部队干部、战士辅导学生学习；还聘请翻身贫苦农奴作教师，给学生讲授阶级斗争和生产斗争知识。学生们通过学习毛主席著作，不仅提高了文化，更重要的是提高了阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。到目前为止，许多学生都能熟练地背诵
  “老三篇”和毛主席语录。他们能结合实际，活学活用，处处按照毛主席的指示办事。他们在学习了毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》以后，树立起互相关心、互相爱护、互相帮助的思想，使全校成了一个团结友爱的战斗集体。学生们放学回家，又是阿爸阿妈学习毛主席著作的辅导员。学生们还积极参加生产劳动，帮助翻身贫苦农奴做好事，受到群众的热烈赞扬。学生们还帮助解放军守卫边疆。
    这个学校的学生通过学习毛主席著作，更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席。他们每天向毛主席请示、汇报，决心按照毛主席指引的方向，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    学生们边学习，边生产，连年获得了丰硕的劳动成果。去年，他们收获的各种蔬菜上万斤，青稞一百多克（每克二十五斤）。粉笔和算盘都是自己制做的。学生们通过经常参加劳动，从小培养起热爱劳动的好习惯。几年来，从这个学校已经先后毕业了三十多名学生，有的已担任了农村的记分员、卫生员，有的成了西藏的第一代工人。
