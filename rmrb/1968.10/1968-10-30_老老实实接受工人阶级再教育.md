	Honestly Accepting Re-education by the Working Class

	Chinese Khrushchev and his agents vigorously promote the idea of "two ears deaf to outside affairs, one heart dedicated to reading the classics," advocating the path of being a specialist without political involvement. They aim to lead intellectuals away from proletarian politics, away from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and away from production practice, to shut themselves up and study documents, chew on books, delve into "advanced" fields, and strive to become "experts." This is to cultivate a batch of capitalist successors to serve their cause of restoring capitalism.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Intellectuals, before they integrate with the revolutionary struggles of the masses and before they resolutely serve the interests of the masses and unite with them, often harbor tendencies of subjectivism and individualism. Their thoughts are often empty, and their actions often waver." Intellectuals who do not unite with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers cannot overcome their fatal weaknesses. I graduated from a technical secondary school in 1953 and was assigned to Tianjin Rolling Mill No. 1. In the early days of my work, influenced by bourgeois individualist thoughts, I felt that the factory lacked automated equipment and that I could not fully utilize my electrical "expertise." However, when I began to interact with the workers, I realized that there was a significant gap between my thoughts and feelings and those of the working class, and we lacked common language. The workers had a high class consciousness and a strong sense of responsibility. They worked diligently for the public good and for the revolution to increase production. In contrast, I only thought about acquiring more technology to enrich myself, driven by personal gain and fame, and I paid little attention to production. Moreover, I was poisoned by revisionist education, learning things detached from production reality, solving no practical problems. After several years of study, I not only could not operate the equipment but had not even seen very ordinary electrical devices. The fact is this: if intellectuals do not unite with the masses of workers and peasants, they will achieve nothing.

	"The masses are the true heroes." As early as 1955, when encountering a motor failure, the worker foreman discussed with me how to fix it, but I could only talk about general strategies. As for how to do it specifically, I had no ideas. The working class's extremely responsible attitude towards revolutionary work educated me. I asked the foreman, "You decide how to do it and we'll start!" In the end, it was the foreman with rich practical experience who had the best solution. Without using any precise instruments, he used a simple method—"testing with a lamp," checking the insulation, and analyzing the actual coils. He quickly determined the fault point and repaired it, solving the problem in time. During the 1961 campaign to promote technological innovation, we conducted research on improving electrical maintenance and control. The foreman proposed an experimental plan to me. At that time, I was afraid of causing accidents and did not dare to conduct the experiment. The foreman said, "Don't worry, if there are problems, we'll find a way to solve them. Everything is done by people." The working class's spirit of daring to think, dare to do, dare to break superstitions, and strive for revolution inspired me. I decided to work with the foreman, and finally, using simple methods, we successfully innovated and solved the key issue of remote operation of high-voltage motors, improving maintenance and control.

	The working class's unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, their excellent qualities of being thorough in revolution, and their spirit of daring to revolutionize and win in revolutionary work are forever the direction of our efforts as revolutionary intellectuals. Only with the noble qualities of the working class can we make inventions and creations and play a role in the cause of socialist revolution. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line of Chinese Khrushchev, resolutely accept re-education by workers, peasants, and soldiers, honestly learn from the working class, strive to change our worldview, and work hard to become new-type intellectuals welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    老老实实接受工人阶级再教育
    天津轧钢一厂革命委员会生产组技术干部　吴仰山
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人极力鼓吹“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”，走白专道路。他们要把知识分子引到脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农兵群众，脱离生产实践，去关门扒资料，啃书本，钻“尖端”，为当个“专家”而奋斗的歧途，从而培养一批资产阶级接班人，为他们复辟资本主义服务。
    毛主席教导我们：“知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”知识分子不与工农兵群众相结合，就不可能克服致命的弱点。我于一九五三年从中专毕业分配到天津轧钢一厂。参加工作的初期，由于受了资产阶级个人主义思想的影响，认为工厂没有自动化设备，感到发挥不了我的电气“专长”。可是，当我开始和工人接触后，就发觉自己与工人阶级的思想感情大有差距，缺乏共同语言。工人师傅阶级觉悟高，有崇高的主人翁责任感。他们一心为公，一心为革命，为提高生产而勤奋劳动。对照我自己，想的只是多捞些技术来充实自己，尽是个人名利思想，对生产漠不关心。再加上我受到修正主义教育的毒害，学的东西脱离生产实际，根本不解决实际问题。上了几年学，自己不但不会操作，甚至连很普通的电气设备也没有见过。事实就是这样：知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。
    “群众是真正的英雄”。早在一九五五年遇到电机故障时，工人师傅和我商量怎样修，而我只能说些原则的对策方法，具体怎样干，就提不出来。工人阶级对革命工作极端负责任的精神教育着我，我请教老师傅说：“您看怎么干就动手吧！”结果还是富有实践经验的老师傅最有办法，也没有用什么精密的仪表，而是用土办法——“试灯”，摸一下绝缘，又分析了实际的线圈，很快地确定了故障点，动手修复，问题及时解决了。在一九六一年大搞技术革新运动中，我们围绕改进电气维护控制，进行研究，师傅向我提出一种试验方案。我当时怕惹出事故不敢搞试验，师傅说：“你别嘀咕了，有问题咱想办法解决，事都是人办成的。”工人阶级敢想敢干、敢于破除迷信、发奋图强的革命精神，使我增强了信心，决心和工人师傅一块干，终于用土办法革新成功，解决了高压电机远方操作的关键，改进了维护控制。
    工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚、富于革命彻底性的优秀品质和在革命工作中敢于革命、敢于胜利的精神，永远是我们革命知识分子努力的方向；有了工人阶级的高贵品质，才能有所发明，有所创造，在社会主义革命事业中发挥作用。我们一定要听毛主席的话，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义科技路线，坚决接受工农兵再教育，老老实实向工人阶级学习，努力改造世界观，为成为受工农兵欢迎的新型的知识分子而努力。
