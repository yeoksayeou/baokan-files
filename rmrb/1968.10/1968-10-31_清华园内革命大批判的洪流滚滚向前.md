The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Tsinghua University, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly," takes class struggle as the key link, mobilizes the masses extensively, and carries out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. This has turned revolutionary criticism into a large classroom for re-educating intellectuals, greatly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, promoting their ideological revolutionization, and advancing the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Now, Tsinghua Garden presents a vibrant revolutionary scene. Everywhere are positions for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and everywhere are battlefields for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. The large-character posters scattered throughout the campus expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents at Tsinghua University under the bright sunlight. In study classes, over the radio, and in one criticism meeting after another, the roaring voices of "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" and "Thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line!" resound. Under the leadership of the workers' propaganda team, every revolutionary teacher and student, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, speaks out and takes action, using both words and pen to actively participate in the magnificent tide of revolutionary criticism.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Tsinghua University regards carrying out revolutionary criticism deeply as an important course in re-educating intellectuals, allowing the broad revolutionary teachers and students to be tempered and tested in revolutionary criticism and to accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers. To fully mobilize the masses to join the ranks of the revolutionary criticism battle, the workers' propaganda team organizes Mao Zedong Thought study classes, doing meticulous ideological work with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, educating the broad revolutionary teachers and students to achieve new merits in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The worker comrades and revolutionary teachers and students together discuss the great situation of the nationwide and Tsinghua University's Cultural Revolution, talk about the great significance of the workers' class leading everything, and discuss the importance of revolutionary criticism. The worker comrades also conduct class education through recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, raising their political awareness and the self-awareness of carrying out revolutionary criticism. Many revolutionary teachers and students, after hearing the old workers' bitter complaints about the old society, said: "We have not suffered the hardships that the teachers have, but our elders have. We grew up in sweet water and cannot forget our roots! We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, actively participate in revolutionary criticism under the leadership of the workers' class, and thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation."

On the basis of fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, the workers' propaganda team guides the revolutionary teachers and students to combine carrying out revolutionary criticism deeply with cleaning up the class ranks, organizing the revolutionary teachers and students to carry out mass activities of big exposure, big discussion, and big investigation, that is, big exposure of a series of strange phenomena in their own units, big discussion of the causes of these phenomena, and big investigation of the handful of class enemies hiding in the revolutionary ranks. The more problems are exposed, the clearer the causes are discussed, and the more class enemies who sneak into the revolutionary ranks to instigate the masses to fight each other, disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, are exposed. The living class struggle reality deeply educates the broad revolutionary teachers and students. They said: "In the past, a tiger was sleeping by our side, and we didn't know it. How dangerous it was! This is precisely the result of being poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of 'the extinction of class struggle.' " In this way, the broad revolutionary teachers and students hate the Chinese Khrushchev even more. They, together with the worker comrades, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the theory of 'the extinction of class struggle' spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, greatly enhancing the class struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students. In the past, teachers and students who were split into two factions by the bourgeois reactionary line and fought "internal wars" for a long time are now united against the enemy, forming "one helps one, one pairs red" pairs in the common struggle to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents; some who were deceived by class enemies also turn around and expose and criticize the class enemies who deceived them.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Students trained in old schools, the majority or a large majority can combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the correct leadership, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must give them re-education to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." In the deep revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, the workers' propaganda team follows the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "the transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation," firmly grasping the reform of intellectuals' world outlook, educating the broad revolutionary teachers and students to go through revolutionary criticism, eliminate the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, resolutely take the road of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Under the enthusiastic help and education of the workers' propaganda team, many teachers and students stand up to accuse and criticize the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Some students angrily said: "The 'reading books to become officials' theory sold by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tsinghua is a poisonous drug that harms the youth. They say that entering Tsinghua University is entering the 'cradle of engineers,' and after graduation, one will not become a political official but a technical official. Under their poison, many people bury themselves in their work, do not ask about politics, and only want to become famous and rich. As a result, the more books they read, the heavier their private thoughts, and the farther they are from workers, peasants, and soldiers." The broad revolutionary teachers and students expressed their determination to sincerely accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly eliminate the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line on themselves in revolutionary criticism, and under the leadership of the workers' class, thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, forever taking the road indicated by Chairman Mao to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队把革命大批判当作对知识分子进行再教育的大课堂
    清华园内革命大批判的洪流滚滚向前
    广大革命师生表示，要在大批判中彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒，在工人阶级领导下，认真搞好斗、批、改
    新华社三十日讯　首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大教导，以阶级斗争为纲，广泛发动群众，深入持久地开展革命大批判，使革命大批判变成了对知识分子再教育的大课堂，大大地提高了广大革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了他们的思想革命化，推动了学校的斗、批、改。
    现在，清华园里呈现着一派生气勃勃的革命景象。到处是宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，到处是批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。遍布全校的大字报专栏，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在清华大学的代理人的反革命罪行暴露在光天化日之下。在学习班里，在广播中，在一个接着一个的大小批判会上，响彻着此起彼伏的怒吼声：“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“彻底批判反革命修正主义教育路线！”广大革命师生在工人宣传队的领导之下，以毛泽东思想为武器，人人开口，个个动手，口诛笔伐，积极投入了波澜壮阔的革命大批判的洪流。
    首都工人驻清华大学毛泽东思想宣传队把深入开展革命大批判作为对知识分子进行再教育的重要一课，让广大革命师生在革命大批判中经受锻炼和考验，接受工农兵的再教育。为充分发动群众投入革命大批判的战斗行列，工人宣传队大办毛泽东思想学习班，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想做深入细致的思想工作，教育广大革命师生在斗、批、改中立新功。工人同志和革命师生们一起大讲全国和清华大学无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，大谈工人阶级领导一切的伟大意义，大议革命大批判的重要性。工人同志还通过忆苦思甜，对师生进行阶级教育，提高他们的政治觉悟和开展革命大批判的自觉性。许多革命师生听了老工人对旧社会的血泪控诉以后说：“老师傅的苦我们没有受过，但是我们的父兄受过。我们是在甜水里长大的，不能忘本啊！我们一定要听毛主席的话，在工人阶级领导下，积极投入革命大批判，认真搞好斗、批、改。”
    在充分调动广大革命师生积极性的基础上，工人宣传队引导革命师生把深入开展革命大批判同清理阶级队伍结合起来，组织革命师生开展了群众性的大摆、大议、大查活动，即大摆本单位出现的一系列怪现象，大议产生这些现象的原因，大查隐藏在革命队伍中的一小撮阶级敌人。问题越摆越多，原因越议越清，揪出了混进革命队伍挑动群众斗群众，破坏毛主席伟大战略部署的阶级敌人。活生生的阶级斗争现实，深刻地教育了广大革命师生。他们说：“过去，老虎睡在身边还不知道，多么危险啊！这正是受了中国赫鲁晓夫‘阶级斗争熄灭’论的毒害。”这样，广大革命师生对中国赫鲁晓夫更加痛恨。他们和工人同志一起以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大大增强了广大革命师生的阶级斗争观念。过去被资产阶级反动路线分裂成两派，长期打“内战”的师生，如今团结对敌，在批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的共同战斗中结成了“一帮一、一对红”的对子；一些受阶级敌人蒙蔽的人，也反戈一击，对蒙蔽他们的阶级敌人进行揭发和批判。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”在对反革命修正主义教育路线进行深入的革命大批判中，工人宣传队遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”的教导，狠抓对知识分子世界观的改造，教育广大革命师生通过革命大批判，肃清反革命修正主义教育路线的影响，坚决走与工农兵相结合的道路，为工农兵服务。在工人宣传队的热情帮助和教育下，许多师生纷纷起来控诉、批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行反革命修正主义教育路线的罪行。有的同学愤怒地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫及其在清华的代理人所贩卖的‘读书做官’论是毒害青年的一剂毒药。他们说什么考上了清华大学就是进了‘工程师的摇篮，毕业后不当政治官也当技术官’。在他们的毒害下，许多人埋头业务，不问政治，一心想成名成家。结果书读得越多，私心越重，离工农兵越远。”广大革命师生纷纷表示决心，要诚心诚意地接受工农兵的再教育，在革命大批判中，彻底肃清反革命修正主义教育路线对自己的影响，在工人阶级的领导下，认真搞好斗、批、改，永远走毛主席指引的与工农兵相结合的道路。（附图片）
