The cannon fire in the tunnel has ignited two battles: soldiers are firing at the Chinese Khrushchev and advancing against nature. This is an exhilarating cannon fire.

In the tunnel, water gushes out like a dragon. Revolutionary soldiers work in the water, their cotton clothes and trousers are soaked. This battle is exhilarating. Here, revolutionary soldiers also fiercely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "merging public and private interests." This battlefield is vivid and lively, with bayonets drawn.

This on-site criticism meeting effectively combines the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness. "Revisionism" is a disaster, and "selfishness" is the root. Without a fierce struggle against selfishness, revisionism cannot be thoroughly criticized; only by thoroughly struggling against selfishness can the root be eliminated. They set up a battlefield in their souls, temper themselves in harsh environments, and dedicate themselves wholeheartedly; they criticize while working, turning the construction site into a battlefield for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they target difficulties, living people, living events, and living thoughts, conducting on-site criticism. They use their actual actions to fiercely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of merging public and private interests" and "philosophy of survival." Each person strives to be a vanguard in criticizing revisionism and a pioneer in struggling against selfishness.

This on-site criticism meeting is a large classroom for linking theory with practice and actively applying Mao Zedong Thought. They target living people, living events, and living thoughts, select a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations, and criticize one of the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies. They study and criticize every day. "Breaking down is the key, and establishing follows." In this way, they greatly arouse their hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly eliminate the poison and influence, and temper their loyalty to Chairman Mao.

This on-site criticism meeting closely follows Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." By carrying out the revolution well, they promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, thereby maintaining a vigorous revolutionary spirit to overcome all difficulties. As people's awareness is raised, courage, initiative, creativity, organizational discipline, and the revolutionary spirit of hardship are all enhanced. On the construction site, they carry out a revolutionary criticism campaign, bringing their hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev to the battlefield. This maximizes the arousal of people's revolutionary spirit, fearing neither hardship nor death, "determined to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." It fully demonstrates the great power of revolutionary criticism. This on-site criticism meeting powerfully promotes the revolutionization of people's thinking and the completion of combat missions. It demonstrates the great power of spiritual force.

This on-site criticism meeting provides excellent experience for deeply and continuously carrying out revolutionary criticism. They closely combine the actual situation and living thoughts of their unit to carry out on-site criticism. This way of criticizing not only touches the soul but is also vivid and lively, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in revolutionary criticism, making revolutionary criticism sustainable.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "We not only propose tasks but also solve the problem of how to complete the tasks. 'Without solving the method problem, the task is just empty talk.'" Using various methods to carry out revolutionary criticism is an important topic for conducting revolutionary criticism well. We must, according to the new situation and characteristics of class struggle, combine the tasks of our unit, target different situations and problems, and create various methods. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, we will carry out revolutionary criticism. In this way, revolutionary criticism will definitely be carried out deeply and continuously.

    这个战场开辟得好
    黎峰
    隧道里的炮声，打响了两场战斗，战士们向中国赫鲁晓夫开火，向自然进军。这是激动人心的炮声。
    在隧道里，水就象水龙似的往外喷，革命战士在水里施工，身上的棉衣、棉裤都是湿淋淋的。这一战斗是激动人心的。而在这里，革命战士又狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化论”。这个战场刺刀见红，生动活泼。
    这个现场批判会，把批修和斗私很好地结合起来。“修”是祸，“私”是根，不狠斗“私”字，对“修”字就批不透；只有很好地斗私，才能斩草除根。他们在灵魂深处摆战场，在艰苦环境中炼真金，一心为公献忠心；在干中批，把工地变成批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，针对困难、针对活人、活事、活思想，开展现场批判，用自己的实际行动狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化论”、“活命哲学”。个个争做批修的尖兵、斗私的闯将。
    这个现场批判会，是理论联系实际，活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。他们针对活人、活事、活思想，选学一段毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一条谬论。天天学、天天批，“破字当头，立也就在其中了”。这样，就大大激发了他们对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，比较彻底地肃清了流毒和影响，锤炼对毛主席的一颗忠心。
    这个现场批判会，紧跟毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召。搞好革命，促进人的思想革命化，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，去克服一切困难。人的觉悟提高了，勇敢也有了，积极性也有了，创造性也有了，组织纪律性也有了，吃苦的革命精神也有了。他们在施工现场，开展革命大批判，带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的满腔仇恨上战场，就能最大地激发人们的革命斗志，一不怕苦，二不怕死，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”充分显示了革命大批判的巨大威力。这个现场批判会，有力地推动了人的思想革命化，促进了战斗任务的完成。它显示了精神力量的巨大威力。
    这个现场批判会，给深入持久地开展革命大批判，提供了很好的经验。他们紧紧地结合本单位的实际和活思想，开展现场批判。这样批，既触及灵魂，又生动活泼，充分调动了广大群众参加革命大批判的积极性，使革命大批判能持续地开展下去。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。”“不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”运用各种方法，开展革命大批判，是搞好革命大批判的重要课题。我们要根据阶级斗争的新形势，新特点，结合本单位的任务，针对不同的情况、不同的问题，创造各种方式方法，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，开展革命大批判。这样，就一定能使革命大批判深入持久地开展下去。
