In the evening, a group of miners who had just finished their shift, holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," rushed from the workshop to the study room. Among them, a young woman in a greasy work uniform with coal dust on her face, was singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" with the miners.

This young woman is Ren Guozhen, an active promoter of Chairman Mao's thought in Fuxin City, a member of the Ping'an Coal Mine Selection Plant Revolutionary Committee, and a technician. After graduating from university and coming to the selection plant, she firmly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely walked the path of combining with the workers, and consciously accepted re-education from the working class. She has taken a big step on the road of revolutionization and laborization. The miners praised her, saying, "Look at her coal-dusted face, just like ours. Such a university graduate, we miners welcome her from the bottom of our hearts."

In the summer of 1964, Ren Guozhen graduated from Jixi Mining Institute and was assigned to work at the Ping'an Coal Mine Selection Plant of Fuxin Mining Bureau. Before coming to the plant, she thought: "I will study hard in the actual work, make some inventions and creations, and become a highly accomplished engineer." After arriving at the plant, she found that the selection plant was a small factory with outdated equipment and dilapidated machinery. The office was a row of low, mud-built rooms, and her heart sank.

Just as she was feeling dejected, two incidents happened that greatly shocked her. One day, the sieve in the coal quality class for screening large coal blocks broke down, and the factory asked her to design a fifty-millimeter round-hole sieve. She casually accepted the task, thinking to herself, "I've studied for over ten years, majored in coal selection, designing such a small thing is nothing." She flipped through the technical documents and quickly designed a sieve according to the regulations. A few days later, she went to the site and saw that the workers were still using the old broken sieve, while the new sieve stood unused. She asked in surprise, "Why aren't you using the new sieve?" A worker smiled and said, "Do you want to crush us to death?" Ren Guozhen thought the workers were joking and seriously said, "This is a standard sieve designed according to regulations." Hearing this, some workers got angry and said, "The person who designed this standard sieve must be a bureaucrat. You try using it, can it work?" Ren Guozhen picked up the new sieve and tried the old one. Indeed, the new sieve was too large and heavy, very impractical. She blushed and walked out.

Not long after, the factory had a coal quality accident. The ash content in the pulverized coal was too high, and the trains could not be dispatched, seriously affecting production. The factory decided to have Ren Guozhen investigate the cause. Ren Guozhen did not go to the site but buried herself in the daily reports, calculating and analyzing for a long time without finding the cause, making her sweat profusely. Just then, an old worker ran over and told her, "Technician, forget about calculating, we've found the cause. It's sand in the pulverized coal." Hearing this, Ren Guozhen felt as if her face had been branded with a hot iron, stinging with pain. She couldn't help but think of the criticism from the coal quality class workers, feeling even more ashamed. The old worker seemed to see her thoughts and said, "Technician, go to the workshop and look. If you stay in the office all the time, who are you serving?" That night, back at home, she tossed and turned, unable to sleep. The old worker's earnest words made her heart restless. She recalled the path she had taken since coming to the factory, the more she thought about it, the more she felt she had taken the wrong path. She excitedly opened Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Orientation of the Youth Movement." Chairman Mao said, "How do you judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do you use? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually combines with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing to and actually combine with workers and peasants are revolutionary, otherwise, they are not revolutionary or counter-revolutionary." She had read this passage from Chairman Mao several times before, but today it felt particularly close to her heart, as if Chairman Mao was speaking directly to her. Ren Guozhen realized that in the past, it was not the sieve that was too large, but the "self" in her mind that was too big, the distance from the workers and peasants was too great; the sand in the pulverized coal was not hard to find, but the thought of fame and status had blinded her eyes. Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and taking the path of combining with workers and peasants, establishing the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, could she make contributions to the revolution.

Ren Guozhen went to the workers, initially having nothing to say to them, fearing to make mistakes or look foolish. The workers noticed her feelings and actively approached her, encouraging and helping her, making her more determined to learn from the working class. Once, because it was cold, the sliding chute under the roller sieve in the manual selection workshop was blocked by frozen lumps of broken coal. Ren Guozhen was working in this workshop and, together with an old worker, used a pickaxe to break the frozen coal. This was a dirty job, and as the pickaxe struck, coal dust flew everywhere. At first, although Ren Guozhen used force with her hands, she kept her mouth tightly shut, fearing that the coal dust would be inhaled. The old worker beside her saw this and sincerely said to her, "You can't be afraid of getting dirty when working. If you are afraid of getting dirty, your thoughts will not be healthy." The old worker's earnest words deeply moved Ren Guozhen. She thought: although she was among the workers, it did not mean she had combined with them. There was still a great difference in her thoughts and feelings. Only by transforming herself from the depths of her soul and thoroughly changing her bourgeois thoughts could she truly combine with the workers. Afterwards, she moved her office to the workshop and site, worked with the workers, humbly asked them for advice, and was willing to be a student of the workers. Once, she went to the site to take samples, and the workers said, "Ren, the sampling process has too many steps and takes too much time. Can you help us improve it?" She happily accepted the task and immediately researched with the workers. After several experiments, she finally solved the problem of too many sampling steps, greatly improving work efficiency.

Under the influence of the advanced thoughts of the working class, Ren Guozhen's thoughts and feelings changed day by day. There was an old worker in the mine whose wife died of illness, leaving two young children with no one to take care of. However, this old worker was not deterred by difficulties and never let household chores affect his work. After learning about this, Ren Guozhen was deeply moved by the old worker's lofty spirit of dedicating himself to the public and the revolution. She took the initiative to go to the old worker's home to wash and mend clothes, helping with household chores. Once, Ren Guozhen returned from the mine and saw two children by a dirty ditch near the factory, looking anxiously around. The dirty ditch occasionally made "splash, splash" sounds. She quickly ran over and saw a young boy stuck in the dirty ditch, with the dirty water already covering his head, the situation was very dangerous. In an instant, the image of Zhang Zide flashed before Ren Guozhen's eyes, and she fearlessly jumped in, rescuing the child. The dirty ditch was full of rotten mud, making it difficult to pull out her legs. She used all her strength to pull out her legs, not even bothering to take her shoes stuck in the mud, and rushed back to the factory with the child in her arms. At the factory, she and a few old workers wrapped the child in a quilt and sent him to the hospital. After rescue, the child quickly recovered.

Ren Guozhen, who had just started to combine with the workers, underwent a severe test and made great progress in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As soon as the Cultural Revolution began, the revolutionary miners responded to Chairman Mao's great call, raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," and rose up to criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Ren Guozhen firmly supported the revolutionary actions of the miners and joined them in the struggle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The big-character posters she and the revolutionary miners put up were like cannonballs, hitting the vital points of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. The capitalist roaders were terrified and hated her to the core, fabricating charges and labeling her as a "counter-revolutionary." Many old miners actively supported her. They told her, "Ren, we firmly support you. If the sky falls, we will hold it up!" The voices of the working class gave her boundless strength. She and the miners stood together, launching an even more fierce attack on the handful of class enemies.

With the help and support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist troops, the new proletarian revolutionary power of the Ping'an Coal Mine Selection Plant was born in the storm of class struggle. The miners unanimously elected Ren Guozhen as a member of the factory Revolutionary Committee. They said, "Ren has been with us through wind and rain, always fighting together. Such an intellectual, we trust."

    矿工们欢迎的大学生
    ——记阜新平安煤矿选煤厂技术员任国珍同工人群众相结合的事迹
    傍晚，一群刚刚交班的矿工，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，从车间涌向学习室。这时，人群中有个穿着油污作业服、脸上沾满煤粉的女青年，在学习室同矿工们一起高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    这个女青年是阜新市活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、平安煤矿选煤厂革委会委员、技术员任国珍。她从大学毕业来到选煤厂后，牢记毛主席的教导，坚定不移地走与工人相结合的道路，自觉地接受工人阶级的再教育，在革命化、劳动化的大道上迈出了一大步。矿工们赞扬她说：“看她那沾满煤粉的黑脸，和咱矿工一个样。这样的大学生，咱们矿工打心眼里欢迎。”
    一九六四年夏，任国珍从鸡西矿业学院毕业后，被分配到阜新矿务局平安煤矿选煤厂工作。来厂前，她想：到实际工作中好好深造，搞点发明、创造，当一名大有作为的工程师。她来厂后，发现选煤厂是个规模不大的小厂，设备简陋，机器陈旧，办公室是一排矮小的土房，心里就凉了半截。
    正在她苦恼的时候，连续发生了两件事，使她受到很大震动。一天，煤质班筛大块煤的筛子坏了，厂里让她设计一个五十毫米圆孔筛子。她满不在乎地接受了任务。心想，自己念了十几年书，又学的选煤专业，设计这么一个小东西算个啥。她翻开技术资料，按规定很快设计出一个筛子。过了几天，她到现场一看，工人们还是用那个破筛子，新筛子立在那没人使用。她奇怪地问：“你们怎么不用新筛子？”一个工人笑了笑说：“你想把我们压死？”任国珍还以为工人们在开玩笑，又一本正经地说：“这可是按规定设计的标准筛子。”听她这么一说，有的工人生气地说：“设计这个标准筛子的人准是个官僚主义者，你试试，这能用吗？”任国珍掂掂新筛子，试试旧筛子，果然新筛子又大又重，很不实用。她红着脸，走了出来。
    时隔不久，厂里发生了一次煤质事故，粉煤含灰量过大，车发不出去，严重影响了生产。厂里决定叫任国珍去查找原因。任国珍没有到现场去，却一头钻到了日报表里，来回计算、分析，好久找不出原因，急得她满头大汗。正在这时，一个老工人跑来告诉她：“技术员同志，甭算了，原因我们找到了，是粉煤里面有砂子。”听了这话，任国珍脸上象挨了一烙铁，火辣辣地难受。她不由地联想起煤质班工人的批评，心里更感到惭愧。老工人象看出了她的心思，就对她说：“技术员哪，你到车间看看啊，老蹲在办公室里你给谁服务哇！”
    晚上，回到家里，她翻来复去睡不着，老工人语重心长的话，使她心里久久不能平静。她回想起来厂后所走过的一段路程，越想越觉得路子走得不对。她激动地翻开了毛主席的光辉著作《青年运动的方向》。毛主席说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”毛主席这段教导她过去也学过几遍，可是今天学起来觉得分外亲切，好象毛主席专门对自己讲的。任国珍认识到，过去不是设计的筛子大，而是头脑中的“私”字大，同工农兵的距离大；粉煤里面的砂子不是不好找，而是成名成家的思想蒙住了眼睛。只有按照毛主席的教导走和工农兵相结合的道路，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，才能对革命作出贡献。
    任国珍到工人中去，起初和工人没话可说，生怕碰钉子、出笑话。工人们看出了她的心情，于是主动接近她，鼓励她，帮助她，使她进一步坚定了向工人阶级学习的信心。有一次，因为天冷，手选车间辊轴筛底下的溜子道，被冻成坨的碎煤堵住了。任国珍正在这个车间劳动，她和老工人一起，用钎子捅冻煤。这是个脏活，钎子一捅，崩得煤粉满脸都是。开始，任国珍虽然手上用劲，嘴却闭得紧紧的，生怕把扬起的煤尘吸进肚里去。她身边的老工人看见后，就诚恳地对她说：“干活可不能怕脏啊，人要怕脏，思想就不会健康。”老工人语重心长的话，使任国珍很受感动。她想：自己虽然人在工人之中，并不等于和工人结合了，思想感情还有很大的差距。只有脱胎换骨，从灵魂深处彻底改造资产阶级思想，才能真正同工人相结合。以后，她把办公室搬到车间、现场，同工人一起参加劳动，虚心向工人请教，甘当工人的小学生。有一次，她上现场取样，工人们说：“小任啊，取样工作，工序太多，太耽误事了，你帮咱改改吧。”她愉快地接受了这个任务，马上和工人一起研究。经过多次试验，终于解决取样工序多的问题，大大提高了工效。
    在工人阶级先进思想的熏陶下，任国珍的思想感情一天天地在发生着变化。矿里有个老工人的爱人因病死了，家中剩下两个小孩没人照顾。但是，这位老工人没有让困难吓住，从没有因为家务而影响工作。任国珍知道这件事后，深深为老工人这种一心为公、一心为革命的崇高精神所感动，就主动到这位老工人家拆洗缝补，帮助料理家务。有一次，任国珍从矿里办事回来，看见厂子附近一条脏水沟旁，有两个小孩张大着眼睛，急得团团转。脏水沟里不时传来“扑通、扑通”的击水声。她急忙跑了过去，只见一个小男孩陷在脏水沟里，脏水已吞没了头部，情况十分危险。刹那间，张思德的光辉形象闪现在任国珍的眼前，她奋不顾身地跳了进去，把孩子抱了起来。脏水沟里积满了烂泥，拔腿十分艰难，她用尽全身力气拔出了双腿，鞋子陷在烂泥里也顾不得拿，抱着孩子就向厂里飞跑。到厂后，她和几个老工人用棉被把孩子包好，送进了医院。经过抢救，孩子很快脱险了。
    刚刚迈开同工人结合步伐的任国珍，在无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨中，经受了严峻的考验，又大大前进了一步。文化大革命一开始，广大革命矿工响应毛主席的伟大号召，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，起来大造党内一小撮走资派的反。任国珍坚决支持矿工们的革命行动，同矿工们一起投入了捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战斗。她和革命矿工们贴出的一张张大字报，象炮弹一样击中了党内一小撮走资派的要害。走资派怕得要死，恨得要命，就捏造罪名把任国珍打成“反革命”。许多老矿工积极支持她。他们对她说：“小任，我们坚决支持你，天塌下来有我们顶！”工人阶级的声音，给她增添了无穷无尽的力量。她和矿工们紧紧团结在一起，向一小撮阶级敌人发动了更加猛烈的进攻。
    在人民解放军支左部队的帮助和支持下，平安煤矿选煤厂新生的无产阶级革命政权在阶级斗争的暴风雨中胜利诞生了。矿工们一致推选任国珍同志为厂革命委员会委员。他们说：“小任和咱们风里来，雨里去，始终战斗在一起，这样的知识分子我们信得过。”
