More than ten thousand Chicago residents staged a protest march in the city center on September 28 to commemorate the large-scale mass movement launched by Chicago residents a month earlier against U.S. aggression in Vietnam. They also angrily protested the brutal suppression of demonstrators by reactionary military police.

The protesters held a mass rally in Grant Park and then marched through the city center, chanting slogans such as "We do not want to fight for Johnson" and "We do not want a fascist state."

New Zealand residents continue to protest against the screening of U.S. films in New Zealand that glorify the U.S. war in Vietnam. On October 4, fifty protesters gathered outside a cinema in Auckland showing a U.S. film. They chanted slogans such as "Victory to the (Southern Vietnamese) National Liberation Front!" "Do not be deceived by U.S. war propaganda!" "U.S. imperialists, get out of Vietnam!" Inside the cinema, many young people also chanted slogans condemning U.S. President Johnson. The authorities sent police to arrest two protesters.

On the same day, a similar protest was held outside a cinema in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand. Protesters held up signs exposing U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

More than a thousand Swedish residents held a torchlit protest march and rally in Stockholm on September 29 to protest U.S. imperialism's support for the Greek fascist military dictatorship. Protesters angrily threw stones at the Greek embassy and chanted slogans such as "U.S. imperialists, get out of Greece!" "Smash fascism!" The protesters included Greeks and other foreigners living in Sweden.

About a thousand West German youth and students held a protest march in Bonn on October 1 to oppose a meeting held by the new fascist party in West Germany, the National Democratic Party of Germany. Before the National Democratic Party's meeting even began, hundreds of youth and students from Bonn and nearby cities had gathered outside the venue to hold a protest rally. They held up signs, chanted slogans, and distributed leaflets condemning the fascist party's activities. When the party's leader, the old Nazi Adolf von Thadden, entered the venue, the protesters, who had already occupied the venue, chanted slogans such as "Nazis get out!" "Down with fascism!" Enraged protesters also threw furniture and tear gas at the stage, and the glass doors of the venue were smashed. Under these circumstances, the fascists had to call off the meeting and leave.

About a hundred Portuguese students held a protest march in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, on October 5 to oppose the fascist dictatorship. The protesters held up signs and banners reading "Down with fascism!" and "We want freedom!" and chanted slogans against the fascist dictatorship. The authorities quickly sent police to suppress the protest, but the protesters were not afraid. They bravely fought back against the police.

Marcello Caetano, who took over from Salazar a week earlier, had boasted that he would continue Salazar's policy of brutally suppressing the people. However, the oppressed Portuguese people will continue to rise up in resistance. Before the students' protest in Lisbon, Portuguese people had distributed anti-government leaflets for three consecutive days in Oporto the previous week.

    美国芝加哥市群众一万多人九月二十八日在市中心举行游行示威，纪念在一个月前芝加哥群众掀起的反对美帝侵略越南的大规模群众运动，并且愤怒抗议反动军警血腥镇压示威群众的暴行。
    示威者在格兰特公园举行了群众大会，然后高呼着“我们不愿为约翰逊而战”和“我们不要法西斯国家”的口号，在市中心举行示威。
    新西兰群众示威反对上演美国影片
    新西兰的奥克兰和惠灵顿市的群众继续举行示威，反对宣扬美帝侵越战争的影片在新西兰上演。四日，奥克兰的五十名示威者在一家放映美国影片的电影院前面举行示威，他们高呼口号：“胜利属于（越南南方）民族解放阵线！”“不要受美国佬战争宣传的欺骗！”“美国佬从越南滚出去！”在电影院内，许多青年也高呼谴责美帝头子约翰逊的口号。当局派出警察，无理逮捕了两名示威者。
    同一天，在新西兰首都惠灵顿的一家电影院前面，也举行了群众性示威，示威者拿着标语牌，揭露美帝侵略越南的暴行。
    瑞典群众抗议美帝支持希腊法西斯
    一千多瑞典群众九月二十九日晚在斯德哥尔摩高举火把，举行示威游行和集会，抗议美帝国主义支持希腊法西斯军事独裁政权。示威者愤怒地向希腊驻这里的大使馆投掷石块，并高呼口号：“美帝滚出希腊！”“粉碎法西斯主义！”参加示威的还有在瑞典的希腊人和其他外国人。
    西德波恩青年举行反法西斯示威
    一千名西德青年和学生一日晚在波恩举行示威，反对西德新法西斯党——德国国家民主党在波恩举行集会活动。德国国家民主党一日晚上的集会还没有开始，波恩以及来自临近各城市的数百名青年和学生就已经在会场外举行示威集会，他们举着标语牌，高呼口号和散发传单，谴责这个法西斯党的活动。当国家民主党的头目、老牌纳粹分子阿道夫·冯·塔登进入会场时，早已占领会场的大批示威者高呼“纳粹滚蛋！”“打倒法西斯！”等口号。愤怒的示威者还向讲台投掷家具、催泪弹，会场的玻璃门也被捣毁。在这种情况下，法西斯分子只好中途收场滚蛋。
    葡萄牙学生示威反对法西斯统治
    约一百名葡萄牙学生五日在葡萄牙首都里斯本举行示威游行，反对葡萄牙法西斯独裁政权的统治。
    示威者高举着“打倒法西斯主义”和“要自由”的旗帜和标语牌，高呼反对法西斯独裁统治的口号。当局慌忙调来警察进行镇压，但是示威者并不害怕，他们同警察进行了英勇搏斗。
    在一个星期前接替萨拉查的马尔塞路·卡塔诺在上台时扬言，他将继续执行萨拉查残酷镇压人民的政策。
    但是，备受压迫的葡萄牙人民必将不断地起来反抗。在这次里斯本学生举行示威之前，葡萄牙人民上星期就一连三天在奥波尔托散发反政府传单。    据新华社讯
