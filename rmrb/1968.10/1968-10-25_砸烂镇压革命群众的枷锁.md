Chairman Mao recently pointed out: “If we do not eliminate the dregs and absorb fresh blood, the Party will lose its vitality.” He also said: “The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses.” Chairman Mao’s words are like the spring rain, nourishing the hearts of the broad masses of workers. Chairman Mao truly speaks for the hearts of our working class.

Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the masses’ spirit of initiative the most. In this great proletarian cultural revolution, Chairman Mao once again emphasizes the role of our working class and wants to absorb advanced elements from among the workers into the Party. This is the greatest care, the greatest trust, and the greatest encouragement for us revolutionary workers! This fully shows how happy it is to be a good worker in the era of Mao Zedong!

However, that great traitor, Chinese Khrushchev, regards the masses as “mob” and “idiots.” He raves madly: “We must struggle against backward ideas and backward phenomena among the masses.” He and his handful of agents brandish the big stick of “the theory of the backwardness of the masses,” keeping a large number of excellent workers with proletarian revolutionary spirit outside the Party’s gates and practicing bourgeois dictatorship over them. This is extremely reactionary and heinous!

The experience of comrade Tian Wenliang, a revolutionary worker in our factory, is a typical example.

Comrade Tian Wenliang is a poor child who grew up in the bitter waters of the old society. Three generations of his family are workers. His father sold his life to the capitalist for a lifetime, and after falling ill, was kicked out of the factory by the capitalist. Finally, he dragged his sick body and froze to death in the street pulling a rickshaw. The old society that devours people also took the lives of his two younger brothers. Since he was seven years old, he had to beg for alms with his mother, eating pig and dog food, wearing rags, enduring the humiliation and beatings of the capitalists, and shedding the bitter tears of the poor. A thunderous spring thunderclap, the savior Communist Party came, leading us poor people to rise up and gain liberation. “Heaven is big, earth is big, but the Party’s grace is the biggest; father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer.” He loves Chairman Mao from the bottom of his heart and is grateful to the Communist Party. He is not afraid of hard work and dirty jobs, determined to repay Chairman Mao and the Communist Party with outstanding work results.

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, his political awareness has been continuously improved. He deeply understands: “The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all mankind.” To sweep away all harmful creatures and liberate the people of the world, one must resolutely follow Chairman Mao to make revolution and resolutely join the great Communist Party of China. With sincere feelings of love for Chairman Mao, he wrote three applications, urgently requesting to join the Party. Unexpectedly, a handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory slandered him as a “backward element,” and his application to join the Party was repeatedly rejected. However, they opened the door wide for a handful of traitors, spies, and capitalists, praising them as “good comrades” and absorbing them into the Party. For example, a capitalist was absorbed into the Party and promoted to deputy factory director, which infuriated the workers! Can it be said that we revolutionary workers are more “backward” than the capitalists? Why can the capitalists who exploit and oppress us join the vanguard of the proletariat, while we revolutionary workers who love Chairman Mao infinitely cannot join the Party of the working class?

Later, the capitalist-roaders in the factory felt that this was too obvious, so they sent someone to do “thought work” with comrade Tian Wenliang. This person, as soon as he saw him, said: “Old Tian, do you know why you can’t join the Party?” He replied: “That’s the decision of the higher-ups, how can I know?” This person quickly said: “Let me tell you the truth, it’s because you like to give advice to the leadership. For example, about cadres not participating in labor, they are cadres, if they want to work, they work, if they don’t want to work, they don’t work, you, a worker, still want to manage them? The leadership represents the Party, you give advice to the leadership, that’s anti-Party, don’t give advice recklessly in the future!” At this time, he finally knew why he had become a “backward element.” He firmly replied: “You want to shut my mouth, that won’t work! I have this mindset, whoever does something in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, I will firmly support, whoever does something against Mao Zedong Thought, I will firmly struggle against!” From then on, he became even more of a thorn in the side of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party within the factory. They spread rumors among the masses, saying he was “backward in thought,” “reactionary in speech,” “this life won’t be able to join the Party,” and tried every means to find excuses to strike at him.

A thunderous clap of thunder, the great proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao personally broke out. Revolutionary workers in the factory further understood that the handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory had Chinese Khrushchev as their ultimate backer. There is a head for every grievance, and a debtor for every debt. It is precisely the “theory of the backwardness of the masses” of this great traitor that has kept many excellent workers outside the Party’s gates for a long time and practiced bourgeois dictatorship over them. Comrade Tian Wenliang, with deep hatred for the capitalist reactionary line, risked his life to rebel against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in our factory and against the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, Chinese Khrushchev. Once, a handful of class enemies incited uninformed masses to surround and insult the PLA propaganda team stationed in the factory. Comrade Tian Wenliang, out of his deep class feelings of love for the people’s soldiers, disregarded his personal safety and stepped forward to engage in fierce debates with them, fighting bravely to defend Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, comrade Tian Wenliang demonstrated the precious proletarian revolutionary spirit of an awakened worker. Everyone saw it with their own eyes and rejoiced in their hearts, pushing this “backward element” in the eyes of the capitalist-roaders to be selected as a worker representative, representing the several thousand workers in the entire factory, representing the working class of the capital, to participate in the National Day celebration. Chairman Mao also invited them to stay in Zhongnanhai, and he was fortunate enough to see the great leader Chairman Mao twice!

We want to ask Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our factory: Which “backward element” can love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party like this? Which “backward element” can stand bravely on the front line of class struggle and resolutely defend Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line? Which “backward element” can love the PLA so much and fight bravely to defend the PLA? Which “backward element” can be selected by the revolutionary masses as a representative and be received by the great leader Chairman Mao?

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship.” Chinese Khrushchev’s wild propaganda of the “theory of the backwardness of the masses” is an attempt to separate the Party from the masses, to destroy the fish-water relationship between the Party and the masses; it is an attempt to obstruct the Party from absorbing fresh blood, causing the Party to lose its revolutionary vitality and gradually degenerate; it is an attempt to turn the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China into the Kuomintang, into a Fascist party, into a tool for him to restore capitalism. We must take up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and smash the “theory of the backwardness of the masses” of Chinese Khrushchev thoroughly, so that the Party can constantly renew itself and constantly absorb fresh blood, and thus build our Party into a vigorous vanguard organization of the proletariat.

    砸烂镇压革命群众的枷锁
    北京新华印刷厂革委会批判组
    毛主席最近指出：“不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”又说：“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”毛主席的话象春天的雨露，滋润着广大工人的心，毛主席真正说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。
    毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众，最尊重群众的首创精神。在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，毛主席又这样重视发挥我们工人阶级的作用，并要吸收我们工人中间的先进分子入党。这是对我们革命工人的最大关怀，最大信任，最大鼓舞！这充分说明，作一个毛泽东时代的好工人是多么的幸福啊！
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫这个大工贼，却把群众当“群氓”，当“阿斗”。他疯狂地叫嚣：“要和群众中的落后意识、落后现象进行斗争”。他和他的一小撮代理人，挥舞起“群众落后论”的大棒，把大批具有无产阶级革命精神的优秀工人关在党的大门之外，并对他们实行资产阶级专政。真是反动透顶，罪恶滔天！
    我厂革命工人田文亮同志的遭遇，就是一个典型的例子。
    田文亮同志是从旧社会苦水里泡大的苦孩子，家里祖孙三代都是工人。父亲给资本家卖了一辈子的命，得病后被资本家撵出厂门，最后拖着病弱的身体，拉着洋车冻死在大街上。吃人的旧社会还夺去他两个弟弟的生命。他从七岁起，就跟着母亲沿街乞讨，吃的是猪狗食，披的是麻包片，受尽了资本家的凌辱打骂，流尽了穷人的辛酸泪。春雷一声震天响，来了救星共产党，领导咱穷人翻身得解放。“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”。他从心眼里热爱毛主席，感激共产党。他不怕工作重，活儿脏，决心用出色的工作成绩报答毛主席，报答共产党。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下，他的政治觉悟不断提高。他深深认识到：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。”要扫除一切害人虫，使天下人民得解放，就得决心跟着毛主席干革命，决心参加伟大的中国共产党。他怀着热爱毛主席的真挚感情，连写三次申请书，迫切地要求加入党。万万没有想到，厂里一小撮走资派却污蔑他是“落后分子”，入党申请书被一次又一次地打入冷宫。但是，他们对一小撮叛徒、特务和资本家却敞开大门，把他们捧为“好同志”吸收入党。例如，一个资本家就被他们吸收入党，并被破格提升为副厂长，工人们知道后肺都要气炸了！难道说我们革命工人倒比资本家还“落后”？为什么剥削和压迫我们的资本家，可以加入我们无产阶级的先锋队，而我们无限热爱毛主席的革命工人倒不能加入工人阶级的党？
    后来，厂里的走资派觉得这样作太露骨，就派一个人给田文亮同志做“思想工作”。这个人一见面就对他说：“老田啊！你知道你为什么不能入党吗？”他回答说：“那是上边的事，我那里能知道？！”这个人连忙说：“实话告诉你吧，就是因为你爱给领导提意见。就说干部不参加劳动吧，人家是干部，愿意干就干，不愿干就算，你一个工人还想管人家啊？领导是代表党的，你给领导提意见，就是反党，以后可别乱提意见了！”这时，他才知道自己为什么成了个“落后分子”。他坚定地回答说：“想堵住我的嘴，这办不到！我就是这么个心眼，谁做的符合毛泽东思想，我就坚决拥护，谁做的违背毛泽东思想，我就要坚决斗争！”从此以后，他就更成了厂里党内一小撮走资派的眼中钉、肉中刺。他们在群众中制造流言蜚语，说他“思想落后”，“言论反动”，“这一辈子也甭想入党”，并千方百计地寻找借口打击他。
    霹雳一声震天响，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命爆发了。广大革命工人进一步明白了厂里一小撮走资派的总后台是中国赫鲁晓夫。冤有头，债有主。正是这个大工贼的“群众落后论”，把不少优秀工人长期关在党的大门之外，对他们实行资产阶级专政。田文亮同志怀着对资产阶级反动路线的刻骨仇恨，冒着生命危险，起来造我厂党内一小撮走资派的反，造党内最大的走资派中国赫鲁晓夫的反。有一次，一小撮阶级敌人挑动不明真相的群众围攻谩骂驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队。田文亮出于热爱人民子弟兵的深厚阶级感情，不顾个人安危，挺身而出，同他们进行激烈的辩论，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而英勇斗争。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，田文亮同志表现出一个觉悟工人的可贵的无产阶级革命精神，大家看在眼里，喜在心上，把这个走资派眼里的“落后分子”，推选为工人代表，代表全厂几千名工人，代表首都工人阶级，参加国庆观礼。毛主席还邀请他们住到中南海，他两次幸福地见到伟大领袖毛主席！
    我们要质问中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我们厂的代理人：有哪一个“落后分子”，能这样热爱毛主席和共产党？有哪一个“落后分子”，能够英勇地站在阶级斗争第一线，坚决保卫毛主席的革命路线？有哪一个“落后分子”，会这样热爱解放军，为保卫解放军而英勇斗争？有哪一个“落后分子”，会被广大革命工人选为代表，受到伟大领袖毛主席的接见？
    毛主席教导我们说：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹“群众落后论”，就是妄图把党同群众隔离开来，破坏党同群众之间的鱼水关系；就是妄图阻挠党吸收新鲜血液，使党丧失革命朝气，逐步蜕化变质；就是妄图把伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党，变成国民党，变成法西斯党，变成他复辟资本主义的工具。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫的“群众落后论”，使党不断地吐故纳新，不断地吸收新鲜血液，从而把我们的党建设成为一个朝气蓬勃的无产阶级先锋队组织。
