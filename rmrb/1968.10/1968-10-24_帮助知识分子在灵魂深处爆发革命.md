The soldiers and officers of a certain agricultural unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin have followed Chairman Mao's instructions. They have addressed the various active thoughts among the students who came to the farm for tempering. They have re-educated them with a proletarian worldview, helping them to establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, and to spark a revolution in their souls. They have gradually tempered them into intellectuals welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Helping Intellectuals Correct Their Attitudes and Accept Re-education from Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

The college graduates and graduate students who came to this farm for tempering have undergone significant tempering and testing during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After arriving at the military farm, they worked alongside the soldiers and officers in the fields, pulling weeds, and moving bricks to build houses. They were willing to get dirty and thoroughly change their old thoughts. However, some intellectuals viewed integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as a way to "gain some experience" and get a good evaluation. Some said, "In the past, we lacked labor tempering, now we are making up for this lesson, which will be useful when we return." Others said, "Actually, labor is just about sweating, exerting effort, gritting teeth, and rolling in the mud, it's just a matter of getting through it." Some even said, "This is the trend of the times, one must be pragmatic."

Where did this "gain experience" mentality come from? The military comrades conducted further investigations and research. They discovered that these students were poisoned by the feudalist ideology of "all trades are lowly, only reading is noble" and influenced by bourgeois educational ideas. Some of them had not fundamentally established the thought of studying for the revolution and for the people. They were always thinking about how to stand out by studying, to become officials and lords. A graduate student's family, generation after generation, did not know how to read or write, and had no idea which way the school door opened. After liberation, his parents and uncles, in order to achieve cultural emancipation, pooled their resources to support his education. However, in the school dominated by bourgeois intellectuals, the more he studied, the less interested he became in the countryside, even forgetting the suffering his parents endured in the old society. The military comrades deeply felt from the serious class struggle between the bourgeoisie and us over the youth that if we do not solve the "gain experience" mentality of intellectuals and help them establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, even if they work hard and sweat on the farm, their thoughts and feelings will still be at odds with those of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The military leadership first helped the students set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the party's relevant policies on intellectuals. They also invited Tianjin Nanjiao Xiaozhan District's active learner and user of Mao Zedong Thought, a knowledge youth who had worked in the countryside for ten years, Zhang Yu'e, to give a report. Following this, the military comrades extensively carried out bitter-sweet education among the students. One by one, one by one, the bloody history stirred up everyone's deep hatred for the old society.

Based on the denunciation of the old society, the military comrades systematically guided everyone to carry out comparison activities: comparing the bitterness of the old society with the sweetness of the new society, examining one's own forgetful thoughts; comparing the bitterness of being poisoned by the revisionist educational line with the sweetness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, examining where one has not kept up with Chairman Mao's strategic deployment. This made everyone hate the old society even more and love the new society; hate China's Khrushchev and love the great leader Chairman Mao; hate the revisionist educational line and love Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Many students excitedly said, "This is the first time we have received such profound education. We must never forget the bitterness of the class struggle and wholeheartedly serve the laboring people for life, completely uprooting the 'gain experience' mentality."

Guiding Intellectuals to Firmly Walk the Path of Emphasizing Proletarian Politics

After initially solving the students' bourgeois ideas of fame and profit through class education, during heart-to-heart talks, the military comrades discovered that this group of students, due to long-term bourgeois education, were deeply poisoned by the idea of emphasizing business over politics. They believed that those engaged in scientific research serve the people through technology. They had already participated in "Four Clean-ups" for a year and the Cultural Revolution for two years, and now coming to the military farm for tempering for another one or two years was too long, and they would forget all their business. They would have to start learning from scratch when they returned. They also reflected that coming to the farm was not as good as going to a factory, learning something not useful. The person came to the farm, but the heart was still in the academy. The military comrades seriously analyzed these problems and believed that the idea of emphasizing business over politics, on the surface, seemed to be for better serving the people, but in essence, it was a variant of the "study to become an official" theory. It was a serious obstacle for intellectuals to consciously accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to thoroughly transform their bourgeois worldview. To transform intellectuals in the image of the proletariat and build a team of proletarian intellectuals that integrates with and serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide them to firmly walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, always putting "a firm and correct political direction" in the first place. Therefore, they took Chairman Mao's military thought and Vice Chairman Lin's principles and policies of emphasizing political construction based on Chairman Mao's military thought as their guide. They took "On Rectifying Wrong Ideas in the Party" and the decisions of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission as their basic textbooks. They extensively lectured on the glorious tradition of political construction in our army, and on the experiences and feelings of relying on politics to fight wars and create four good things in peacetime. They also used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize the reactionary revisionist fallacies spread by China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, such as "education first," "three passes" (politics passes, technology and business pass, life passes), "technical center," "military and politics should take turns being emphasized," and "emphasizing politics must be embodied through business."

To make them receive a living education, the military comrades also invited active learners and users of Mao Zedong Thought from the military to give reports and share experiences. A graduate student who previously thought that "the more books one reads and the higher one's business level, the greater one's contribution to the people" was deeply moved when he heard about a medical soldier from a certain unit, Liu Guangxi, who had only been in the army for a year and a half and had only studied five months of health knowledge. With the glorious "Three Articles" as his motto, Liu overcame numerous difficulties and finally rescued an elderly peasant woman from the brink of death. This woman had been diagnosed as having an "incurable disease" by a "authority" in a certain large hospital in Tianjin and was pushed out to die. The graduate student felt deeply that contributing to the people is not mainly about how many books one has read or how high one's business level is. As long as one has a red heart of wholeheartedly serving the people, one can make the greatest use of the business and technology one has already mastered, creating miracles that the reactionary technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie could never have imagined. A graduate student from a worker's family, who had suffered since childhood, originally thought that he was a child of the working class, born in bitter water and raised under the red flag, with red roots and strong stems, following Chairman Mao firmly. As long as he studied his business well and achieved some results, he would not disappoint the party and the people's cultivation. In this re-education, through reviewing Chairman Mao's teachings that "without a correct political viewpoint, one is like a person without a soul," and recalling his own process of changing thoughts and feelings in a school dominated by bourgeois intellectuals, he was shocked to realize: "Red roots can also bear white fruits." In a world where classes and class struggle still exist, if one does not care about politics and does not pay attention to ideological transformation, burying oneself in business all day, one will consciously or unconsciously betray one's own class and become a captive of the bourgeoisie. At the study and use meeting, some college graduates and graduate students deeply felt: "Only by learning from the People's Liberation Army and firmly walking the path of emphasizing proletarian politics can we, under the leadership of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have a redder heart and firmer will, and have the determination and ability to create miracles and scale new heights in scientific research work, benefiting the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers."

Educating Intellectuals to Spark a Revolution in Their Souls and Thoroughly Change Old Thoughts

After holding study classes and a period of labor tempering, the thoughts and feelings of this group of college graduates and graduate students also gradually changed. However, on the other hand, their weaknesses of incompleteness and vacillation in their revolution began to surface. A graduate student regretted taking the wrong path, saying, "I shouldn't have gone to college, and I shouldn't have become a graduate student. If I hadn't gone to college, I would at least be a seventh or eighth-level worker now and could be a leader." Facing the intellectuals' state of mind, the military comrades seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." They unanimously believed that the key to re-educating intellectuals is to do patient, arduous, and detailed ideological and political work, inspiring them to actively carry out ideological struggles, consciously sparking a revolution in their souls, and thoroughly eliminating the influence and residue of old thoughts.

A female graduate student reviewed her more than twenty years of ideological changes: At first, the poor peasants in the village hoped that she would learn some skills and come back to help them with accounts. With great difficulty, they supported her to finish junior high school. But after graduating, she worked as an accountant for a production team for a year and felt that it was not as promising as going to school. So, she re-enrolled in high school. After graduating from high school, she worked as a teacher for a year and felt that it was not as good as continuing to "study further," so she enrolled in college and became a graduate student. Under the influence of the revisionist educational line, from junior high school to graduate school, an idea became clearer and clearer in her mind: the more books one reads, the higher one can "rise" in the future. Now she feels that studying is a loss because the proletarian educational revolution has blocked her path of "studying to become an official." She deeply felt: "The 'studying is a loss' theory is a selfish account calculated from the bourgeois standpoint. No matter how many mistakes one makes, the most fundamental mistake is in the bourgeois 'self' character." Inspired by her, some college students also compared and examined themselves with Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune's thorough and complete spirit of serving the people. They realized that wearing shoes with a "self" character cannot walk the socialist path. Only by resolutely deciding to undergo long-term and even painful tempering, thoroughly cleansing the mud and dirt in one's mind, and changing one's worldview from the roots, can one truly become a good soldier of Chairman Mao and a good child of the masses.

The military comrades also paid attention to leading by example, using their actual actions of loyalty to Chairman Mao to educate the intellectuals. Once, while moving bricks, a female graduate student was afraid of dirtying her clothes. She picked up a brick, blew and patted it from left to right, cleaning off the surface dirt, and then carefully placed it on her shoulder. However, when she turned around and saw that the nearby PLA soldier did not pick and choose, picked up a brick and put it on his shoulder, she suddenly felt her face burning. During a rest, she studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." She felt uneasy and realized that the soldier's image was tall, while she was really small.

This group of college students and graduate students, although their tempering in the military farm has just begun, their spiritual appearance has already or is undergoing tremendous changes. They said: "From elementary school to college, we have found one school after another, and this time we have truly found the best Mao Zedong Thought school of the PLA; we have found one teacher after another, and this time we have truly found the best teachers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought—the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

    帮助知识分子在灵魂深处爆发革命
    解放军驻天津某部农场指战员遵循毛主席教导，针对来场锻炼的学生存在的活思想，用无产阶级世界观对他们再教育，帮助他们树立全心全意为人民服务的思想
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”解放军驻天津某部农场全体指战员遵循毛主席的教导，紧紧抓住来场锻炼的大学毕业生和研究生中存在的各种活思想，用无产阶级世界观对他们进行再教育，帮助他们自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，使他们逐步锻炼成为工农兵所欢迎的知识分子。
    帮助知识分子端正态度自觉接受工农兵再教育
    来这个农场锻炼的大学毕业生和研究生，在无产阶级文化大革命中经受了很大的锻炼和考验。他们来到部队农场后，和指战员一起下田拔草，一起搬坯盖房，愿意滚一身泥巴，彻底改变旧思想。但是，部分知识分子把和工农兵结合看作是“镀镀金”，捞个好鉴定。有的说：“过去我们缺乏劳动锻炼，现在补上这一课，将来回去就好办了。”有的说：“其实劳动只要出出汗，卖卖力，咬咬牙，滚身泥，也就顶了过去。”还有的甚至说：“这是大势所趋，要识时务。”
    这种“镀金”思想是怎么来的？部队同志作了进一步的调查研究。发现这些学生是受了“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”封建主义思想的毒害，受了资产阶级教育思想的影响。他们之中一些人，还没有从根本上树立为革命读书，为人民读书的思想，成天考虑的是读书出人头地，做官当老爷。有个研究生的家，祖祖辈辈不识字，从来不知道学校门向哪开。解放后，他的父母叔伯为了在文化上也闹翻身，几家合力供养他上学。可是，他在资产阶级知识分子统治的学校里，书读的越多，对农村越不感兴趣，甚至连自己父母在旧社会受的苦也全忘了。部队同志从资产阶级向我们争夺知识青年的严重的阶级斗争中，深刻体会到，如果不解决知识分子这种“镀金”思想，帮助他们树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，他们在农场虽则出了力，流了汗，思想感情却仍然和工农兵格格不入。
    于是，部队领导首先帮助学生开办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的最新指示，以及党对知识分子的有关政策，还邀请天津南郊小站地区活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、在农村插队劳动十年的知识青年酆玉娥同志作报告。紧接着，部队同志在学生中广泛开展了忆苦思甜教育。一件件、一桩桩的血泪史，激发了大家对旧社会的无比仇恨。
    在控诉旧社会的基础上，部队同志又系统地引导大家开展忆比活动：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，查自己的忘本思想；忆受修正主义教育路线毒害的苦，比执行毛主席无产阶级教育路线的甜，查自己在那些地方没有跟上毛主席的战略部署。从而使大家更加痛恨旧社会，热爱新社会；痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫，热爱伟大领袖毛主席；痛恨修正主义教育路线，热爱毛主席无产阶级教育路线。许多学生激动地说：“这是我们有生以来第一次受到这样深刻的教育。我们要一辈子不忘记阶级苦，全心全意为劳动人民服务一辈子，把‘镀金’思想连根铲除。”
    引导知识分子坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治道路
    通过阶级教育，初步解决了学生中“读书做官”的资产阶级名利思想之后，在谈心交心活动中，部队的同志又发现这批学生由于长期受资产阶级的教育，中重业务轻政治的毒害较深。他们认为：搞科学研究的，是靠技术为人民服务的，自己已经搞了一年“四清”、两年文化大革命，这次再到部队农场锻炼一、二年，时间太长，业务都会忘光，回去后还得从头学起。他们还反映：来农场不如下工厂，学非所用。人到了农场，心还在科学院。部队同志对这些问题作了认真的分析，认为重业务轻政治的思想，从表面上看，似乎是为了更好地“为人民服务”，但实质上是“读书做官论”的变种，是知识分子自觉地接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改造资产阶级世界观的严重障碍。要按照无产阶级的面貌改造知识分子，建立一支与工农兵结合、为工农兵服务的无产阶级知识分子队伍，就要用毛泽东思想引导他们坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，始终把“坚定正确的政治方向”放在第一位。于是，他们以毛主席建军思想和林副主席根据毛主席建军思想提出的一整套着重政治建军的方针原则为指针，以《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、军委扩大会议决议为基本教材，大讲我军政治建军的光荣传统，大讲我军战时靠政治打仗、平时靠政治创四好的经验体会。并同学生们一起用毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所散布的反动的“智育第一”、“三过思想”（即政治上过得去，技术业务上过得硬，生活上过得好），“技术中心”论、“军事政治应该轮流突出”、“突出政治必须通过业务来体现”等反革命修正主义谬论。
    为了使他们受到活的教育，部队的同志还请部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子给他们作报告，介绍经验。有的研究生过去认为“对人民的贡献有多少，就看书本读多少，业务水平高不高”，当他们听了某部卫生队一个入伍只有一年多，仅仅学过五个月保健知识的卫生员——刘广喜，胸怀“无限忠于毛主席、为贫下中农争气”的雄心壮志，以光辉的“老三篇”为座右铭，克服重重困难，终于把一个被天津某大医院里的资产阶级“权威”定为“不治之症”，推出不管的贫农老大娘从死亡线上抢救出来的生动事迹后，深刻地感觉到：对人民贡献有多少，主要不看书本啃了多少，只要有一颗全心全意为人民服务的红心，就能使自己已掌握的业务技术发挥最大的作用，创造出为资产阶级反动技术“权威”所意想不到的奇迹。植物所一个出身工人家庭，从小受苦的研究生，原先总认为自己是一个生在苦水里，长在红旗下的工人阶级子弟，根红苗壮，跟毛主席是跟定了，只要好好研究业务，搞出点成绩来，就算不辜负党和人民的培养。在这次再教育中，通过重温毛主席“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”的教导，回忆自己在资产阶级知识分子统治的学校里思想感情的演变过程，使他触目惊心地感到：“红根也可能结白果”，在世界上还存在阶级和阶级斗争的情况下，如果不关心政治，不注意思想改造，成天埋头业务，那就会自觉不自觉地背叛自己的阶级，成为资产阶级的俘虏。在学习讲用会上，一些大学毕业生、研究生深有体会地说：“只有向解放军学习，坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，才能使自己在毛主席革命路线领导之下，心更红，志更坚，有决心，有能力在科学研究工作中，创奇迹，攀高峰，造福于工农兵群众。”
    教育知识分子在灵魂深处爆发革命彻底改变旧思想
    经过举办学习班和一段时间的劳动锻炼，这批大学毕业生和研究生思想感情也逐渐地发生了变化。但是另一方面，他们的革命不彻底性和动摇性的弱点也开始有所流露。有的研究生后悔自己走错了路，一不该上大学，二不该当研究生。说：“我要是不上大学，现在起码也是七、八级工，也能当领导阶级了。”针对知识分子这种思想状况，部队同志认真学习毛主席的教导：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。一致认为，对知识分子进行再教育，最关键的是通过做耐心的、艰苦的、细致的思想政治工作，启发他们积极开展思想斗争，自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底肃清旧思想的流毒和影响。
    一个女研究生，回顾了自己二十多年的思想变化：开始，村里贫下中农抱着让她学些本事，回来好为他们记账的愿望，好不容易供她念完了初中，可她毕业后当了一年生产队会计，就觉得不如上学有出息。于是重新考入了高中。高中毕业后，当了一年教员又觉得不如继续“深造”好，于是又考入了大学，进而当了研究生。在修正主义教育路线的毒害下，从初中到研究生，有一个念头在她的思想上越来越明朗：就是书读得越多，将来就可以“升”得越高。现在所以觉得读书吃了亏，就是因为无产阶级教育革命堵塞了自己“读书升官”的道路。她深有体会地说：“‘读书吃亏’论就是站在资产阶级立场上算的唯利是图的账。千错万错，最根本的就错在一个资产阶级‘私’字上。”在她的带动下，一些大学生也纷纷以张思德、白求恩完全彻底为人民服务的共产主义精神对照检查了自己，认识到穿着“私”字的鞋走不了社会主义的路。只有痛下决心，“经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练”，彻底洗涤自己头脑里的污泥浊水，把自己的世界观来一个脱胎换骨的改变，才能真正成为毛主席的好战士，人民群众的好儿女。
    部队的同志还注意以身作则，用忠于毛主席的实际行动对知识分子进行教育。有一次搬土坯，有个女研究生唯恐把自己的衣服搞脏了，扶起坯来，左吹右吹，七拍八拍，把表面的泥土吹打干净了，才小心翼翼地放在肩上。可是当她转身发现身边的解放军战士不挑不拣，提起一块往肩上一搁就背走了，顿时感到脸上火烧火燎的，休息时，她学习了毛主席的教导：“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”觉得心里不安，感到战士形象高大，自己实在太渺小。
    这批大学生、研究生尽管在部队农场的锻炼才刚刚开始，但他们的精神面貌已经或正在发生着巨大的变化。他们说：“我们从小学到大学，学校找了一所又一所，这次才真正找到了解放军这所最好的毛泽东思想的大学校；老师找了一个又一个，这次才真正找到了工农兵这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的最好的老师。”
