The scale of the student struggle is unprecedented, and the struggle has rapidly spread to more than ten states, gaining widespread support from workers and peasants.

New China News Agency, October 9th: Our correspondent reports that in recent times, the broad masses of young students in Mexico have launched an unprecedented, fierce, and heroic struggle against the savage repression, brutal persecution, and bloody massacres by the reactionary authorities. This massive storm of struggle has powerfully impacted the rule of the Mexican monopoly bourgeoisie and shaken the "backyard" of U.S. imperialism—the entire Latin American continent.

This storm of struggle began in late July when students in Mexico City went on a general strike and held large-scale demonstrations to protest the so-called "riot police" suppressing student movements and brutally persecuting progressive students. Throughout the struggle, as the reactionary military police escalated their bloody suppression of the student movement, the tide of students' struggle against persecution and massacre surged higher and higher.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force." The revolutionary youth of Mexico in this struggle against persecution and massacre fully prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's wise judgment. The focus of this student struggle is to protest the atrocities committed by the so-called "riot police," directly trained by U.S. imperialism, against the student movement and the persecution of progressive students. From the outset, students clearly put forward political demands to disband the "riot police," abolish laws suppressing people's movements, release political prisoners, release arrested students, punish the murderers, and compensate the families of the victims. The just struggle of the broad masses of students has won the sympathy and support of patriotic people from all social strata. The development of this struggle has been very rapid, with waves of struggle rising and falling, spreading from the capital Mexico City to more than ten states and some important cities such as Nuevo León. The strike by university students has expanded to include tens of thousands of workers, peasants, teachers, and patriotic people from various strata in large-scale marches and mass rallies. On August 27th, 200,000 students, workers, and peasants in the capital held a magnificent anti-repression demonstration march. As the march passed through the streets, crowds of onlookers continuously cheered for the demonstrators. This was the largest mass demonstration in Mexico in nearly thirty years.

In the process of struggling against persecution and repression, Mexican students have from the beginning fought back against the atrocities of the reactionary military police. They occupied the buildings of higher education institutions, built barricades on the streets, and used stones, clubs, and Molotov cocktails to counter the attacks of armed military police. The capital Mexico City was the most intense area of this struggle. For more than two months, students from universities and high schools across the city continuously held strikes, marches, demonstrations, and meetings, strongly condemning and protesting the brutal repression of the progressive student movement by the Mexican authorities. The students fearlessly fought against the fully armed military police, who even used armored cars, helicopters, and rocket launchers, in a heroic and intense struggle.

On July 26th, tens of thousands of students in the capital began an anti-persecution demonstration march, demanding the disbandment of the "riot police." The authorities sent out large numbers of military police in an attempt to disperse the demonstrating students, but the students fought back, overturning cars and building barricades, engaging in fierce combat with the reactionary military police. When several thousand students in the capital marched and demonstrated again on the 29th, heading towards the U.S. Embassy, the reactionary military police carried out even more savage repression, even using rocket launchers to bomb the gate of a high school where demonstrating students were gathered, then charging in to persecute the students who continued to fight.

This escalating repression sparked even greater resistance. Starting from August 5th, students in the capital held continuous protests with tens of thousands of participants. On August 13th, 80,000 students in Mexico City, despite various threats from the reactionary authorities, formed a procession more than five kilometers long, marching to the "Zócalo" near the presidential palace to strongly protest the military police's repression of students, pushing the struggle against persecution and repression to a new high.

The Mexican authorities were terrified by the burgeoning student movement and on September 18th, brazenly sent out more than ten thousand military police, using dozens of military trucks, armored cars, and police vehicles to forcibly occupy the largest university in Mexico, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, using bayonets to force students to leave the school in an attempt to extinguish the flames of the student movement. Subsequently, on the 24th, they used the same method to occupy the National Polytechnic Institute and other seventeen schools in the capital, and carried out mass arrests. However, the reactionary authorities' brutal repression not only failed to stop the tide of the student struggle but instead sparked even stronger resistance from Mexican students. The just struggle of the students spread from Mexico City to many important cities in the interior and received the support of railway workers, power plant workers, and other industrial workers.

Under the pressure of the powerful student movement, the reactionary authorities were forced to withdraw armed troops from the National Autonomous University of Mexico at the end of September, but the reactionary army still occupied several other schools. When more than ten thousand students in the capital held a large-scale protest meeting in the Tlatelolco district on the evening of October 2nd, once again strongly protesting the military police's occupation of schools and reiterating their just demands, the reactionary authorities exposed their savage intentions of fake withdrawal and real massacre. As the meeting was in progress, the signal was given from helicopters overhead, and the armed military police, accompanied by armored cars, immediately launched a heartless and ruthless machine-gun sweep of the gathered crowd. The Mexican Minister of Defense viciously declared that he would "stop at nothing to suppress student unrest." In this bloody massacre, unarmed Mexican students used stones and sticks as weapons, fighting the reactionary military police for several hours, displaying great courage. In recent days, students have continued their struggle. They have held protest meetings and demonstrations, angrily condemning the military police's bloody massacre. They wrote on the monument in the city center, expressing their determination to fight: "Victory or death!"

The large-scale struggle of Mexican students against persecution and massacre is another wave of struggle following the large-scale anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship struggles of students and workers in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and other South American countries earlier this year. The heroic struggle of Mexican students has shattered the so-called "peace" and "stability" that U.S. imperialism has long tried to maintain in this Latin American country adjacent to the United States, causing panic in the Mexican ruling class.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The upsurge of the student movement inevitably promotes the upsurge of the entire people's movement." Following the wave of powerful student movements in a series of Latin American countries, the storm of student struggle in Mexico heralds a new upsurge in the people's revolutionary movement, which will inevitably rise across the entire Latin American continent.

Fight on, Mexican youth!

    墨西哥学生反迫害斗争风暴震撼拉丁美洲
    学生斗争的规模是前所未有的，斗争迅速扩展到十多个州，得到工人农民广泛支持
    新华社九日讯　本社记者报道：墨西哥广大青年学生最近一个时期为反对反动当局对他们的野蛮镇压、残酷迫害和血腥屠杀展开了空前激烈的英勇斗争。这一场大规模的群众斗争风暴，有力地冲击着墨西哥垄断资产阶级的统治，震撼了美帝国主义的“后院”——整个拉丁美洲大陆。
    这次斗争风暴，是从七月下旬墨西哥城的广大学生为抗议所谓的“防暴队”镇压学生运动和野蛮迫害进步学生而举行的总罢课和大示威开始的。在整个斗争过程中，随着反动军警对学生运动血腥镇压的逐步升级，广大学生反迫害、反屠杀的斗争浪潮迅猛发展，一浪高过一浪。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席说：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。”墨西哥革命青年在这次反迫害、反屠杀斗争中的表现，充分证明了毛主席的这一英明论断的正确。这次学生斗争的焦点是抗议由美帝国主义直接训练的、专门镇压进步群众运动的所谓“防暴队”对学生运动进行镇压和残害进步学生的暴行。学生们在斗争一开始就明确地提出了解散“防暴队”、废除镇压人民运动的法律，释放政治犯，释放被捕学生、惩罚杀人凶手和抚恤被杀害者的家属等政治要求。广大学生的正义斗争，赢得了各社会阶层爱国人士的广泛同情和支持。这次斗争的发展十分迅猛，斗争浪潮此伏彼起，从首都墨西哥城扩展到新莱昂州等十多个州和一些重要城市。从大学生的罢课扩展到包括工人、农民、教师和各阶层爱国人士在内的数十万人的大游行和群众集会。八月二十七日，首都二十万学生、工人和农民举行了浩浩荡荡的反镇压示威游行。当游行队伍通过大街时，成群的行人不断向示威者欢呼。这是墨西哥近几十年来规模最大的一次群众性大示威。
    墨西哥学生在反迫害、反镇压的斗争过程中，对反动军警的暴行一开始就进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们占领了高等学校的校舍，在街上筑起街垒，用石块、棍棒、汽油瓶反击武装军警的进攻。墨西哥首都墨西哥城是这次斗争发展最为激烈的地区。两个多月来，全城大、中学生不断举行罢课、游行示威、集会，强烈谴责和抗议墨西哥当局对进步学生运动的残酷镇压。学生们不畏强暴，同全副武装，甚至动用装甲车、直升飞机以至火箭炮的大批军警，进行了英勇、激烈的斗争。
    七月二十六日，墨西哥首都数万名学生开始举行反迫害示威游行，要求解散“防暴队”。当局出动大批军警企图驱散示威学生，但是，学生们奋起反击，翻倒汽车，筑起街垒，同反动军警展开了激烈的搏斗。当首都几千名学生二十九日再次举行游行示威、正向美国大使馆进发时，反动军警实行了更为野蛮的镇压，甚至使用火箭炮轰击聚集着示威学生的一所中学的校门，然后冲进去迫害坚持斗争的学生。
    这种变本加厉的镇压，激起了学生更大的反抗。从八月五日开始，首都学生连续举行有数万人参加的抗议示威。八月十三日，墨西哥城的八万名学生不顾反动当局的种种威吓，又组成长达五公里多的队伍，游行到总统府附近的“中央广场”集会，强烈抗议军警镇压学生的暴行，把反迫害、反镇压斗争推向又一个高潮。
    墨西哥当局被蓬勃发展的学生运动吓破了胆，九月十八日悍然派出上万名军警，动用数十辆军用卡车、装甲车和警备车，强行占领了墨西哥最大的大学国立墨西哥大学，用刺刀迫使学生离开学校，企图扑灭学生运动的烈火。随后，又在二十四日用同样手法占领了国立工学院等首都十七所院校，并且进行了大逮捕。但是反动当局的残暴镇压，不但阻挡不了学生斗争的浪潮，反而激起墨西哥学生更强烈的反抗。学生的正义斗争从墨西哥城进一步扩展到内地许多州的重要城市，并且得到了铁路工人、电力工人等产业工人的支持。
    在学生运动的强大压力下，反动当局九月底被迫从国立墨西哥大学撤走武装部队，可是反动军队依然强占着其他十几个院校。当首都一万多名学生十月二日晚在特拉特洛尔科区举行大规模抗议集会，再次强烈抗议反动军警占领学校，重申他们的正义要求时，反动当局便赤裸裸地暴露了它们假撤退、真屠杀的凶恶面目。当集会正在进行时，会场上空的直升飞机发出信号，有装甲车配合的武装军警立即丧心病狂地用机枪猛烈扫射参加集会的广大群众。墨西哥国防部长恶狠狠地叫嚷：他将“不惜任何代价来镇压学生骚乱。”就在这次血腥大屠杀中，手无寸铁的墨西哥学生用石头、木棍等作武器，同反动军警进行了好几个小时的顽强搏斗，表现了大无畏的精神。最近几天，学生们继续坚持斗争。他们纷纷举行抗议集会和示威，愤怒谴责反动军警的血腥屠杀。他们在市中心的雕刻碑上涂上了表达他们斗争决心的战斗口号：“不取得胜利，誓不罢休！”
    墨西哥学生这次大规模反迫害、反屠杀的斗争，是继今年早些时候在巴西、阿根廷、智利、乌拉圭等南美洲国家的学生、工人开展的大规模反美反独裁斗争之后出现的又一个斗争浪潮。墨西哥学生的英勇斗争，打破了美帝国主义长期来竭力在这个紧挨着美国本土的拉丁美洲国家保持的所谓“平静”、“稳定”局面，引起了墨西哥统治集团的惊慌。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”继拉丁美洲一系列国家掀起声势浩大的学生运动浪潮之后，墨西哥学生斗争风暴的掀起，预示着一个人民革命运动的新高潮，必将在整个拉丁美洲大陆兴起。
