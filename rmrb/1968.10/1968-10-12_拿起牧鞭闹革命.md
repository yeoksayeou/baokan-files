In the Duerbet grasslands of Nenjiang region, Heilongjiang Province, when the herdsmen talk about Nenjiang Regional Revolutionary Committee member and Mongolian herdsman Chulu, they all say: "Chulu has become a committee member, but the revolutionary spirit of the Mongolian herdsmen has not changed. He is a good descendant of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Chulu, this Mongolian poor child who grew up in the bitterness of the old society, was only five months old when his father, due to years of hard labor for the landlord, was worked to death. His mother, carrying him, begged for food and wandered the desolate grasslands. After Chulu's hometown was liberated, he and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle Mongolian herdsmen, with deep class feelings of limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, eagerly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. The more they read, the more they loved reading, and the brighter their minds became. In March of last year, Chulu was elected by the broad masses of commune members as a representative of the revolutionary masses to participate in the Nenjiang Regional Revolutionary Committee.

After returning from the founding meeting of the Nenjiang Regional Revolutionary Committee, Chulu immediately returned to the pasture. The old herdsmen spoke earnestly to Chulu, "You've become a committee member, but you can't put down your herding stick!" Chulu deeply understood that this was the old herdsmen's encouragement and exhortation to him. Putting down the herding stick meant abandoning the labor spirit of the Mongolian herdsmen and disappointing Chairman Mao's expectations. His emotions were unsettled for a long time. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, "We Communists are not seeking official positions, but are making revolution," which made him clearly realize: although his political status had changed, the essence of the working people could not change, the red heart of serving the people wholeheartedly could not change, and the determination to pick up the herding stick and make revolution could not change. Only by never leaving the masses could one forever maintain revolutionary youth. From then on, wherever there was difficulty, he went; wherever there was hardship, he ventured.

On the pasture, the most arduous work is herding horses at night. In the summer, mosquitoes bite, and dew falls; in the winter, one faces wind and snow, enduring the cold. But Chulu has a red sun in his heart. He voluntarily took on the task of herding horses at night. Someone said, "Chulu has become a committee member, and he still herds horses?" Chulu replied, "Being a committee member is no different from everyone else. The difference is that the responsibility to serve the people is greater. In the great era of Mao Zedong, there is no essential difference between 'officials' and the people; everyone must do revolution and serve the people." Whether it was the scorching summer or the biting winter, he was the same as before, galloping across the grasslands with his horse and whip, always maintaining the spirit of a herdsman.

One night, a pregnant mare in the herd was about to give birth. The mare was sick, and giving birth was difficult. This place was far from the veterinary station, and if not rescued in time, both the mare and the foal would be in danger. At this time, he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, "Our responsibility is to the people," and proceeded to perform an artificial delivery on the mare, ensuring the mare's safety. Another night, it rained heavily, and a gust of wind startled the herd, causing them to run to a place several miles away. He and the herdsman Shao Qing, following Chairman Mao's teachings, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," faced the wind and rain and chased after the herd for several hours, finally driving the herd back to the pasture. Upon returning, both of them were soaked, frozen, and could not speak. When everyone advised them to rest, Chulu said, "My task is not yet complete!" Saying this, he turned around and harnessed the cart, bringing back the foals from the grasslands. Old herdsman Chen Liang excitedly said, "Chulu has become a committee member, but he has not changed the diligent and brave spirit of the Mongolian herdsmen. Having such a person in power, we are at ease."

    拿起牧鞭闹革命
    在黑龙江省嫩江地区杜尔伯特草原，牧民们一提起嫩江地区革命委员会委员、蒙族放牧员楚鲁，都说：楚鲁当了委员，蒙族牧民的革命本色没有变，是贫下中农的好后代。
    楚鲁，这个在旧社会苦水里泡大的蒙族穷孩子，在他出生五个月的时候，阿爸由于给地主长年扛活，劳累成疾，活活被折磨死了。阿妈抱着他到处讨饭，流浪在荒凉的大草原……。楚鲁家乡解放以后，楚鲁和广大蒙族贫下中牧一样，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作，越读越爱读，越读心里越亮堂。去年三月，楚鲁被广大社员群众选为革命群众的代表，参加了嫩江地区革命委员会。
    楚鲁参加嫩江地区革命委员会成立大会回来后，他立即返回牧场。老牧民们语重心长地对楚鲁说：“你当上委员了，可不能把牧鞭放下呀！”楚鲁深深懂得这是老牧民们对自己的鼓励和鞭策，放下了牧鞭，就是丢掉了蒙族牧民的劳动本色，就是辜负了毛主席他老人家的期望啊！他的心情久久不能平静，反复学习了毛主席“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的教导，使他清楚地认识到：政治地位变了，劳动人民的本色不能变，完全彻底为人民服务的红心不能变，拿起牧鞭闹革命的决心不能变，只有时刻不脱离群众，才能永葆革命青春。从此以后，哪里困难，他就往哪里去，哪里艰苦，就往哪里闯。
    在牧场上，比较艰苦的工作是放夜马。夏天，蚊子咬，露水淋；冬天，顶风雪，冒严寒。但楚鲁心中有颗红太阳，他主动承担了放夜马的工作。有人说：“楚鲁当委员了，还放马？”楚鲁回答说：“我当委员和大家没有什么两样的。和大家不一样的，就是为人民服务的责任更大了。在伟大的毛泽东时代，‘官’和民没有本质上的区别，都要干革命，为人民服务。”不管是烈日当头的盛夏，还是寒风刺骨的严冬，他都和往常一样，跃马扬鞭驰骋在草原上，始终保持牧民的本色。
    一天夜里，牧群中有一匹怀驹的青骒马要下驹。母马有病，下驹有困难，这儿离兽医站又很远，如不及时抢救，母马和马驹有死亡的危险。这时，他想起了毛主席“我们的责任，是向人民负责”的教导，动手给母马实行人工接产，终于保证了母马的安全。又有一天夜里，雨下得很大，一阵狂风把马群刮惊了，马群跑到十几里以外的地方。他和牧民邵青两人，遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，迎着狂风暴雨，向马群追去，一直追赶了几个小时，终于把马群赶回牧场。回来后两人衣服全湿透了，冻得说不出话来。后来大家劝他们休息时，楚鲁说：“我的任务还没完成呢！”说罢他又转身套车，把草原上的马驹拉了回来。老牧民陈良激动地说：“楚鲁当了委员，没改变蒙族牧民勤劳勇敢的本色，有这样的人掌权，我们放心。”            本报通讯员
