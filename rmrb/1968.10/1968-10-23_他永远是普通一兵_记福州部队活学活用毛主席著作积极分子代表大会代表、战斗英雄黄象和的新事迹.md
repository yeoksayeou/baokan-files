Half a year has passed since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Fuan District, Fujian Province. One of the standing committee members of the Revolutionary Committee has always lived in a collective dormitory with everyone else, sleeping on a single wooden bed. This standing committee member is Huang Xianghe, the deputy director of the Political Department of the Fuan Military Sub-district and a combat hero.

Huang Xianghe, known as the "Old Eighth Route Army Soldier" in the Revolutionary Committee, has been in the revolutionary army for 28 years. During the war years, he participated in over 200 major and minor battles and was awarded the title of hero once and the title of model eight times. Before becoming a standing committee member of the Fuan District Revolutionary Committee, he was the political commissar of the People's Armed Forces Department of Shouning County and also served as the head of the Shouning County Revolutionary Committee. When he came from Shouning County to the Fuan District Revolutionary Committee, he brought with him Chairman Mao's works, a hoe, and a backpack made from a yellow quilt. He walked from Shouning to Fuan, crossing mountains and rivers, bringing the glorious traditions of the "Old Eighth Route Army" into the Revolutionary Committee and setting a new example for everyone.

In the Revolutionary Committee, he lives in a collective dormitory; when he goes to the countryside, he stays with poor and lower-middle-class peasants, eating and living with them. In the summer, when there are many mosquitoes in the countryside, he uses his military uniform to cover his head while sleeping. Once, he went to the Ganju Town Ganju Brigade to inspect work in the rain, arriving there close to midnight. He thought that the cadres had worked hard all day and were very tired, so he didn't want to disturb them. He found two long benches in the office, used his raincoat as a pillow, and slept on the benches until dawn. The brigade cadres found him sleeping on the benches and felt bad about it. He smiled and said, "What's there to feel bad about? Sleeping on benches makes your spine stronger!" As for eating, he is very casual. Whatever the poor and lower-middle-class peasants eat, he eats. He never makes special arrangements for himself. It was still when he was the head of the Shouning County Revolutionary Committee. Once, he went to the Kangdi Commune to inspect work. The commune cadres prepared food for him, but he didn't eat it. Instead, he went to a production brigade ten miles away and had an old poor peasant cook sweet potatoes for him. He said, "The food of the poor and lower-middle-class peasants is the sweetest, the vegetables are the most fragrant, and also the most nutritious. Eating the food of the poor and lower-middle-class peasants often will keep you from forgetting your roots."

Huang Xianghe takes his hoe wherever he goes. During the mass production movement in the Anti-Japanese War, he won the title of labor hero with his hoe; today, he uses his hoe to resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and maintain a frugal and simple style. He firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teachings: "Cadres should participate in collective production labor to maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system. It helps to overcome bureaucracy, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism." In the Revolutionary Committee, no matter what kind of labor, he actively participates. From wiping windows, wiping tables, to emptying spittoons, sweeping toilets, he is always the first to volunteer and the first to work. When he goes to the countryside, he works in the fields with the commune members. Whatever the commune members have on their bodies, he has on his; whatever sweat the commune members have, he has. Once, he went to the Pingfeng Commune in Shouning County to understand the work situation and saw that the commune members were cutting rice in the muddy fields. He put his luggage on the dike, rolled up his pants, and went down to the field. Everyone knew he had walked a long way and advised him to rest for a while before working. He said, "It's not tiring! It's been a long time since I came to your brigade. The 'official' attitude has been built up again. Today, I want to trample the 'official' attitude into the muddy field and make it rot!" He finished cutting the rice with the commune members before going to the village to rest.

Huang Xianghe treats every labor participation as a battle. He said that in the war years, fighting with bayonets and hand grenades was a battle. The purpose of that battle was to eliminate the armed enemy and seize political power for the proletariat. Today, in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, cadres participating in collective production labor is also a "battle." The purpose of this "battle" is to use the sweat of labor to resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, oppose revisionism, and make cadres maintain the youth of proletarian revolutionary warriors, closely connect with the masses, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Huang Xianghe always appears before the masses as an ordinary laborer. People see a very precious quality in this old soldier: he, like workers, poor and lower-middle-class peasants, and soldiers in the regiment, always implements Chairman Mao's teachings in his actions. Like learning from Lei Feng and Menghu, he puts it into a "do" word. He said that the older the cadres are, the better they should learn and do. After becoming a standing committee member of the Fuan District Revolutionary Committee, he is even stricter with himself, like Lei Feng and Menghu, putting revolutionary interests first, and always and everywhere caring for the masses. In July of this year, he and the mass movement group members Li and Xie were on a business trip. At the Zherong County station, they met a family member on a visit. This family member, with two children and two large bundles of luggage, got off the bus and didn't know what to do. Huang Xianghe saw this and immediately helped the family member carry the luggage. Li and Xie were very moved and also voluntarily helped her carry things and hold the children. The three of them escorted this family member to her destination. Another time, he met an old man over fifty years old on a mountain, carrying a large bundle of cypress wood, sweating profusely, and rushed forward to help the old man carry it. He carried it for six or seven miles, all the way to the village entrance.

Huang Xianghe regards conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses as his most important responsibility. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions come out, he steps on the dew, faces the frost, crosses mountains and valleys, from one commune to another, from one village to another, spreading Chairman Mao's voice to every household. To convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions, he traveled over a thousand miles last year in Shouning, covering all 13 communes and over 100 production brigades in the county; since this year, he has covered five counties and half of the district. Some young comrades see Huang Xianghe traveling far and wide, walking on foot, and say with concern, "Old Huang, you are old. In the future, don't go to far places. Let us run." Huang Xianghe smiled and replied, "If you don't run far, the iron feet trained by Chairman Mao will rust, and the heart burned in the fire of war will turn 'revisionist.'"

    他永远是普通一兵
    ——记福州部队活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表、战斗英雄黄象和的新事迹
    福建省福安专区革命委员会成立半年了。革委会里的一位常委，一直和大家住集体宿舍，睡单人木板床。这位常委，就是福安军分区政治部副主任、战斗英雄黄象和。
    被人称为“革委会里的‘老八路’”的黄象和，参加革命队伍已经二十八年。在战争的岁月里，他身经大小战斗二百多次，曾荣获一次英雄、八次模范称号。在担任福安专区革委会常委以前，他是寿宁县人民武装部的政委，并担任过寿宁县革委会主任。他从寿宁县来福安专区革委会的时候，带来了毛主席著作，还带来了两样东西：一把锄头，一个用一床黄被子打的背包。他从寿宁翻山涉水步行来到福安，就把“老八路”的光荣传统带进了革委会，为人们做出了新榜样。
    在革委会，他住在集体宿舍；下乡，他住在贫下中农家，和贫下中农吃住在一起。夏天乡下蚊子多，他就用军衣蒙着头睡觉。有一次，他冒雨到甘蔗镇甘蔗大队检查工作，到那里后已经快半夜了。他想到干部们白天劳动了一天，已经很累，不能再打搅他们了，便在办公室里找了两条长凳，用雨衣作枕头，在长凳上睡到天亮。大队干部发现他睡在凳子上，很过意不去。他却笑着说：“这有什么过意不去？睡板凳，越睡腰杆越硬！”至于吃，更随便，贫下中农吃什么，他吃什么，从来不搞特殊化。那还是在寿宁县当革委会主任的时候，有一次他到坑底公社检查工作，公社干部准备的饭他没吃，竟跑到十里外的一个生产大队，叫老贫农给他煮地瓜干吃。他说：“贫下中农的饭最甜，菜最香，也最有营养。经常吃贫下中农的饭，就不会忘本。”
    黄象和走到哪里，把手中的锄头带到哪里。在抗日战争时期的大生产运动中，他拿着锄头赢得了劳动英雄的称号；今天，他又用锄头抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，永远保持艰苦朴素的作风。他牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”在革委会里，不管什么劳动，他都积极参加，从擦窗子，抹桌子，到倒痰盂，扫厕所，他样样抢在先，干在前。到了农村，就和社员一起下田，一起劳动，社员身上有多少泥，他身上有多少泥，社员流多少汗，他流多少汗。有一次，他到寿宁县屏峰公社西山大队了解工作，看到社员正在烂泥田里割稻子，他把行李往田埂上一放，挽起裤管下了田。大家知道他走了很远的路，劝他休息一会再干。他说：“累不着！好久没来你们大队了，‘官’架子又搭起来了，今天，我要把‘官’架子踩到烂泥田里，叫它烂得发臭！”他同社员一气把稻子割完，才进村休息。
    黄象和每参加一次劳动，都作为一次战斗来进行。他说，在战争年代，拚刺刀，拚手榴弹，是战斗，那战斗的目的是消灭拿枪的敌人，为无产阶级夺取政权；今天，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，干部参加集体生产劳动，也是“战斗”，这场“战斗”的目的，是为了用劳动的汗水抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，反对修正主义，使干部保持无产阶级革命战士的青春，密切联系群众，巩固无产阶级专政。
    黄象和处处以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现在群众面前。人们从这位老战士的身上，看到一种非常宝贵的品质，就是他象工人、贫下中农、连队战士一样，处处把毛主席的教导，落实在自己的行动上。象学雷锋、学门合，他就放在一个“干”字上。他说，干部越老，就要学得越好，做得越好。他当了福安专区革委会常委以后，更是严格要求自己，象雷锋、门合那样，把革命利益摆在第一位，并且处处、时时关心群众。今年七月间，他和群运组小李、小谢出差，在柘荣县车站遇到一个探亲的家属。这位家属带着两个孩子，两大捆行李，下了汽车简直不知怎么办。黄象和看到后，立刻帮助这位家属扛行李。小李和小谢很感动，也主动帮她拿东西、抱孩子，三个人一直把这个家属送到目的地。还有一次，他在山上遇到一个五十多岁的老人，挑着一大担杉木，累得满头大汗，就抢上前去帮老人挑，一气挑了六、七里，一直把老人送到村头。
    黄象和把向广大革命群众传达毛主席的最新指示，作为自己最重要的职责。每当毛主席的最新指示一传来，他就踏着晨露，迎着风霜，翻山越岭，从一个公社走到另一个公社，从一个山村走到另个山村，把毛主席的声音传遍千家万户。为了传达毛主席的最新指示，去年他在寿宁长途跋涉一千多华里，跑遍了全县十三个公社、一百多个生产大队；今年以来，他又跑遍了五个县，大半个专区。一些年轻同志见黄象和跋山涉水、徒步奔走，关切地说：“老黄啊，你年纪大了，往后，远路的地方你别去，让我们跑吧。”黄象和笑着回答说：“不跑远路，跟毛主席练出的这双铁脚板，就要生锈了，在战火中烧红的这颗心，就会变‘修’了。”
