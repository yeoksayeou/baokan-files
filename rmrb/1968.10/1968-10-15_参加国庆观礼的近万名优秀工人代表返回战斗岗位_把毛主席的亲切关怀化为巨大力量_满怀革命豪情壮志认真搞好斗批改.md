Nearly 10,000 excellent worker representatives who participated in the National Day celebrations have returned to their posts. They will turn Chairman Mao's warm care into a great force, and with revolutionary enthusiasm and determination, they will earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The nearly 10,000 worker representatives from across the country, approved by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao to be invited to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, have returned to their respective posts after happily accepting Chairman Mao's inspection and warm reception. With the great leader Chairman Mao's immense care, they are filled with the great ambition of the working class to lead everything and the determination to earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	By today, all worker representatives from various places have left the capital. Over the past few days, Beijing Station has been adorned with red flags and filled with the sound of drums. Workers from the capital, PLA soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses, with deep proletarian feelings, warmly sent off the representatives as they returned to their respective regions. As the representatives boarded the trains, they excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They said, Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao approving our invitation to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations is Chairman Mao's greatest trust, greatest care, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur for us, the working class. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin Biao as the deputy, unify our thoughts, policies, steps, and actions, shoulder the great historical mission entrusted to us by the great leader Chairman Mao to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all fields of the superstructure, and vow to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

	Nearly 10,000 worker representatives from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, by the side of the great leader Chairman Mao, further tempered their hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Before leaving Beijing, the worker representatives wrote resolutions and guarantees, held discussion meetings and sharing sessions, and enthusiastically talked about their gains from this trip to Beijing. They excitedly said: We saw the great leader Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao is in extremely good health, which is the greatest happiness for the working class and the people of the entire nation! Chairman Mao's heart is connected with ours, the working class. We, the working class, will follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. Many worker representatives, before boarding the train, specially came to Tiananmen Square to solemnly swear to Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, we will forever be loyal to you, we will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, and be your good workers. The sea may dry up, and the rocks may crumble, but the working class's red heart loyal to you will never change!

	During their stay in Beijing, the worker representatives from various places repeatedly studied Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important speech on National Day, the National Day editorials from the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, and visited Beijing Knitting Factory, Beijing New China Printing Factory, Tsinghua University, and other units. They exchanged and learned from each other about the experiences in consolidating and developing revolutionary committees, criticism, cleaning up the class ranks, rectifying the party, streamlining organizations, promoting the revolution and production, and leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all fields of the superstructure. The worker representatives expressed that after returning, they will quickly convey Chairman Mao's care to the broad masses of workers and revolutionary people, and spread the advanced experiences of carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the capital and other regions. To do a good job in spreading advanced experiences, worker representative delegations from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, before leaving Beijing, repeatedly discussed the various advanced experiences they learned, and combined with the actual situation in their respective regions, formulated specific measures for learning and promoting them. They are determined to make these advanced experiences the common wealth of the working class and revolutionary masses across the country, and to further launch a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various regions.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." During their stay in Beijing, although the worker representatives had many activities every day, they always put the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all their work. Many worker representatives wrote notes on their study of Chairman Mao's works every day, used Chairman Mao's instructions to examine themselves, and were inspired by the example of the working class in the capital actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, continuously engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. The worker representatives, by the side of Chairman Mao, universally carried out the "remembering bitterness and thinking sweetness" activity. Through recalling the different changes in the status of the working class in the old and new societies, they enthusiastically sang the praises of the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fiercely criticized and exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, and further raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They expressed that they would definitely turn Chairman Mao's warm care for the working class into a great force. After returning to their units, they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further carry out the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, continuously improve their political awareness, and achieve new merits in the struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

    满怀革命豪情壮志认真搞好斗批改
    新华社十四日讯　伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席批准邀请来京参加国庆观礼的全国近万名工人代表，在幸福地接受了毛主席的检阅和亲切接见之后，带着伟大领袖毛主席的巨大关怀，胸怀工人阶级必须领导一切的豪情壮志和一定认真搞好斗、批、改的决心，已陆续返回各自的战斗岗位。
    到今天为止，各地工人代表已全部离开首都。这几天来，北京车站红旗招展，锣鼓喧天。首都工人、解放军指战员、红卫兵小将和革命群众，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，热烈欢送代表们返回各地。代表们在登上火车的时候，无限激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”他们说，毛主席和林副主席批准邀请我们来京参加国庆观礼，是毛主席对我们工人阶级的最大信任，最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。我们一定紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，在毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，统一认识，统一政策，统一步伐，统一行动，肩负起伟大领袖毛主席交给我们工人阶级的领导好上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的伟大历史使命，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    全国二十九个省、市、自治区的近万名工人代表，在伟大领袖毛主席的身边，进一步锤炼了他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的红心。工人代表们在离京前夕，纷纷写决心书、保证书，开座谈会、讲用会，畅谈这次来京的收获。他们激动地说：我们见到了伟大领袖毛主席，毛主席身体非常非常健康，这是我们工人阶级和全国人民的最大幸福！毛主席和我们工人心连心，我们工人阶级要紧跟毛主席闹革命。许多工人代表在临上火车前特地来到天安门，列队向毛主席庄严宣誓：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们永远忠于您，我们永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好工人。海可枯，石可烂，工人阶级忠于您的红心永不变！
    各地工人代表在北京期间，反复学习了林彪副主席国庆节的重要讲话，学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的国庆社论，参观了北京针织总厂、北京新华印刷厂、清华大学等单位，相互学习交流了巩固发展革命委员会、大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党、精简机构、抓革命促生产以及领导上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的经验。工人代表们表示，回去以后，要以最快的速度，向广大工人和革命群众传达伟大领袖毛主席的关怀，传播首都和其他地区搞好斗、批、改的先进经验。为了做好传播先进经验的工作，各省、市、自治区的工人代表团在离京以前，都反复讨论了他们学到的各项先进经验，并且结合本地区的实际情况，制订了学习和推广的具体措施。他们决心让这些先进经验成为全国工人阶级和广大革命群众的共同财富，在各地进一步掀起斗、批、改的新高潮。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”工人代表们在北京期间，尽管每天活动很多，但始终把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。许多工人代表天天写学习毛主席著作的心得笔记，用毛主席指示对照检查自己，以首都工人阶级活学活用毛主席著作的榜样激励自己，不断地斗私批修。工人代表们在毛主席身边，普遍开展了“忆苦思甜”活动。他们通过回忆工人阶级在新旧社会地位的不同变化，热情歌颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们表示，一定要把毛主席对我们工人阶级的亲切关怀，化为巨大的力量，回到本单位后，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，不断提高自己的政治觉悟，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中立新功。
