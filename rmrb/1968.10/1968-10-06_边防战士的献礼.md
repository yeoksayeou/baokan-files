Border Guards' Tribute

	The towering Yinshan Mountains rise in layers of peaks,
	The green grasslands stretch out endlessly.
	The golden sun shines with rays of light,
	The red flag of the motherland flies high.
	The National Day celebration is approaching,
	The hearts of revolutionary soldiers surge with excitement.

	On the eve of National Day, the soldiers of a certain regiment's 12th Company, who stand guard day and night on the northern border of the motherland, stand atop the Yinshan Mountains, their hearts turned towards Beijing. Facing the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, their hearts are surging with emotion. With hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, they all pondered a question: What gift can we offer to celebrate National Day?

	Comrades thought: Navigating the seas requires a helmsman, and revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought. The brilliant victories of the Cultural Revolution in the motherland are due to the wise leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao and the radiant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We revolutionary soldiers, fighting day and night on the high mountains and steep cliffs, endure the cold and melt the ice and snow with the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. On the wind-swept grasslands, we advance bravely, guided by the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought. Among countless gifts, the most precious is to sing the praises of the wise helmsman Chairman Mao. All the comrades in the company have one heart turned towards Chairman Mao and together decided: With the hands of all the soldiers and officers in the company, we will embroider the glorious image of the great leader Chairman Mao. We will hang the portrait of Chairman Mao high on the Yinshan Mountains, letting the light of the red sun shine forever over the vast grasslands and forever illuminate the direction of the revolutionary soldiers' struggle.

	But the company's base is remote, and there are no materials. No matter how great the difficulty, it cannot daunt revolutionary soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Communist Party member Yang Songxian volunteered to go down the mountain to buy thread. He crossed mountains and valleys, traveling over a hundred miles to a county town to buy various colors of thread. Medical orderly Liu Tailin thought of every possible way to modify injection needles into embroidery needles. At noon, he did not rest, facing the scorching sun, grinding needles on rocks. Beads of sweat fell like broken pearls. The political instructor said, "Little Liu, rest a bit and then grind." Little Liu did not even lift his head, firmly replying, "Political instructor, this is not just grinding a needle; this is tempering the revolutionary soldiers' infinitely loyal red hearts to Chairman Mao!"

	The embroidery began. During the day, comrades fought on their posts, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At night, despite the day's fatigue, they sat under small kerosene lamps, needles flying, threads weaving, hurriedly embroidering Chairman Mao's portrait to offer their loyalty to the great leader.

	Deputy squad leader and Communist Party member Yang Songxian stayed up all night for several nights, no matter how tired or sleepy, he always focused intently, stitch by stitch, thread by thread, embroidering. Old soldier Wang Shaocai, the son of a poor peasant, with hands full of calluses, picked up the embroidery needle with immense emotion. He said as he embroidered, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is because of you that the poor people have everything; it is because of you that the Chinese revolution is victorious and the world revolution has hope. We remember your teachings: Do not forget that three-quarters of the world's poor people are still not liberated; the motherland's territory of Taiwan is still trampled by the American and Chiang Kai-shek devils. We stand on the mountain top, observing the world, and vow to plant the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts all over the world!" Wang Shaocai's words of steel-like determination expressed the voice of all the soldiers and officers in the company. All the comrades, stitch by stitch, thread by thread, thought of loyalty, sweated for loyalty, and exerted effort for loyalty. Every stitch expressed the revolutionary soldiers' deep love for Chairman Mao, and every thread connected the hearts of all the soldiers and officers in the company, tightly surrounding the red sun.

	The portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao was completed. It is like a radiant red sun, illuminating the hearts of the revolutionary soldiers, making them shine brightly.

	All the comrades gathered under Chairman Mao's portrait, dressed in military attire, holding the Red Book, solemnly vowing: Dear Chairman Mao, the revolutionary soldiers fighting day and night on the border of the motherland are infinitely loyal to you, infinitely loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and infinitely loyal to your revolutionary line. We vow to defend you to the death, unyielding even if mountains crumble and the earth splits! We will forever follow you, steadfast even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble! Following the helmsman forward, we will definitely make the whole world red!

    边防战士的献礼
    巍峨阴山重峦叠嶂，
    绿色草原一片茫茫。
    金色太阳霞光万道，
    祖国山河红旗飘扬。
    国庆佳节就要来到，
    革命战士红心激荡。
    国庆节前夕，日夜守卫在祖国北部边疆的某部十二连干部战士们，站在阴山顶，心向北京城，面对无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，个个心潮汹涌澎湃。他们怀着无限忠于毛主席的颗颗红心，都在思考着一个问题：做件什么礼物，向国庆节献礼。
    同志们想：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。祖国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，靠的是伟大舵手毛主席的英明领导，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀。我们革命战士，日夜战斗在高山峻岭。抗严寒化冰雪，靠的是毛泽东思想的万丈光芒；在风沙迷漫的草原上奋勇前进，靠的是光焰无际的毛泽东思想导航。千件礼，万件礼，歌颂英明的舵手毛主席是最珍贵的礼。全连同志一个心眼向着毛主席，共同商量决定：用全连指战员的双手，绣出伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象。把毛主席像高挂在阴山顶上，让红太阳的光辉永远照耀着千里草原，永远照耀着革命战士的战斗方向。
    可是，连队驻地偏僻，没有材料怎么办？就是天大的困难，也难不倒无限忠于毛主席的革命战士。共产党员杨松贤主动要求下山买线。他翻山越岭，跑到百多里以外的县镇上，买来了各种颜色的线。卫生员刘太林想方设法，用注射针改制绣针。中午他顾不得休息，顶着烈日，在岩石上磨针，汗珠象断线的珠子往下掉。指导员关心地说：“小刘，休息休息再磨吧！”小刘顾不得抬头，坚定地回答：“指导员，这不是磨的一根针，这是磨炼革命战士无限忠于毛主席的红心啊！”
    开始刺绣了。白天，同志们战斗在自己的岗位上，为保卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗。晚上，同志们不顾一天的劳累，坐在小煤油灯下飞针走线，赶绣毛主席像，向伟大领袖敬献忠心。
    副班长、共产党员杨松贤好几个晚上彻夜不眠，不管多累多困，他始终聚精会神，一针针一线线地刺绣着。老战士王绍才，这个贫苦农民的儿子，长满茧子的双手，拿起绣针心情无比激动。他一面绣一面说：毛主席啊，毛主席！有了您，才有穷苦人民的一切；有了您，中国革命得胜利，世界革命有希望。我们牢记您的教导，不忘世界上还有三分之二的穷苦人民没解放；祖国领土台湾还受美蒋魔鬼践踏。我们站在高山顶，眼观全世界，誓将您光辉思想的伟大红旗，插遍全世界！王绍才豪情满怀的钢铁誓言，道出了全连指战员的心声。全连同志你一针我一线，心往忠字上想，汗往忠字上流，劲往忠字上使。针针都表达了革命战士无限热爱毛主席的深情厚意，线线都把全连指战员的颗颗红心紧紧地连在一起，紧紧地围绕在红太阳的周围。
    伟大领袖毛主席的像绣好了。她象一轮光芒四射的红日，把革命战士的颗颗红心照得透亮。
    全连同志集合在毛主席像下，整军容，举红书，向毛主席庄严宣誓：敬爱的毛主席，日夜战斗在祖国边疆的革命战士，无限忠于您，无限忠于您的光辉思想，无限忠于您的革命路线。我们誓死保卫您，山崩地裂志不移！永远紧跟您，海枯石烂不变心！紧跟舵手向前进，定叫全球红遍！                      永忠东　公宣东（附图片）
