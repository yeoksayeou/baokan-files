Yan'an County Hezhuangping Commune Yangjiawan Primary School is a people-run primary school established in 1944 under the personal care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Since its establishment, the poor and lower-middle peasants have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasped the power of school education, inherited and carried forward the excellent revolutionary traditions of running schools in Yan'an under Chairman Mao, and trained batch after batch of laborers with socialist consciousness and culture for the countryside. This school is one of the more outstanding people-run primary schools in the county and was once praised as a model people-run primary school in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region. In 1947, when the Chiang-Kuomintang bandits invaded Yan'an, the school was destroyed and temporarily closed. After Yan'an was liberated, the poor and lower-middle peasants reopened the school. Currently, the school has two teachers and 44 students. Since its establishment, the poor and lower-middle peasants have always held the reins of school education. Their method of managing the school is to have the poor and lower-middle peasants elect a board of directors, who then select a person to manage the school's daily work. At the beginning, middle, and end of each semester, the school's responsible person and the board of directors report to the poor and lower-middle peasants on teaching, student, and financial matters, listen to their opinions about the school, and make timely improvements to school teaching and management.

Persisting in the Struggle Between Two Educational Lines

The poor and lower-middle peasants grasp the power of school education, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and resist the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. They abolished the old educational system and old teaching methods. Around 1957, three old scholars from the old society successively came to this school to teach. They used old teaching methods, filled the students' minds with feudal poison such as the "Five Tigers," and made the students sit in caves reading "dead books" all day, turning them into dullards. They even slandered the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants as "stupid." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangjiawan, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, immediately saw that this was a matter of direction and a major issue concerning who would cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. They followed Chairman Mao's great directive that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," and told these three old scholars: "You should let the students participate more in labor, not let them forget labor, and not turn them into bookworms who are clumsy and ignorant of the five grains." These three old scholars treated the poor and lower-middle peasants' opinions as if they were hearing the wind, still insisting on their old ways. The poor and lower-middle peasants held a meeting to discuss the matter and eventually sent these three old scholars away. They selected excellent young intellectuals to be teachers, with the poor and lower-middle peasants serving as consultants, and the school took on a new look. In terms of teaching content, they replaced the old textbooks with Chairman Mao's works, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide teaching, and arm the students' minds. To cultivate the students' labor outlook and the thoughts and feelings of the laboring people, they added labor courses, such as organizing students to plant trees, collect tree seeds, gather firewood, collect fertilizer, carry water for military families and five-guarantee households, and sweep yards, and invited the poor and lower-middle peasants to teach labor courses to the students. They took the students to the fields and farmlands, where old farmers and technicians lectured, and the students learned while working, combining their book knowledge with practical production. The teaching was based on rural reality, teaching students to keep accounts, write letters, and write notes for daily use.

For a period, the school's leadership was usurped by a traitor who vigorously promoted China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, attempting to lead the school down the revisionist path, spreading fallacies such as "city-run schools have bright glass windows and shiny painted desks and chairs, where children can study comfortably, and village-run schools can be closed." Many poor and lower-middle peasants used the facts of cultivating batch after batch of five-good members in earthen caves and old desks and chairs to refute such claims. They firmly said, "The school must be run, and the glorious revolutionary tradition of hard work and plain living cannot be abandoned!" The poor and lower-middle peasants took back the school's leadership from this traitor, persisting in Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and the direction of running the school.

Taking Every Measure to Facilitate the Enrollment of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Children

To facilitate the enrollment of poor and lower-middle peasants' children, the school adopted the following four measures:

First, prioritize the enrollment of poor and lower-middle peasants' children.

Second, adjust the teaching schedule according to the agricultural seasons. Take a break during busy farming periods and study more during slack periods. If there is work to be done, students can take leave, and the missed lessons will be made up by the teachers and helped by classmates.

Third, allow students to bring younger siblings to school. Some poor and lower-middle peasants have many children and heavy burdens, so their children are allowed to bring their younger brothers and sisters to school together, listen to classes together, and receive education together, solving the problem of school enrollment for school-age children and giving many preschool children early education.

Fourth, alternate between studying and laboring. Two students from poor and lower-middle peasant families, Yu Zhengming and Guo Hulin, have fewer laborers and face difficulties in life, making it impossible for them to attend school all day. They take turns herding sheep for the team. Today you go to school and I herd sheep, tomorrow I go to school and you herd sheep, both herding sheep and attending school.

Due to the school's various measures to facilitate the enrollment of poor and lower-middle peasants' children, 95% of the poor and lower-middle peasants' children in Yangjiawan and Dujia Gully have been enrolled in school. The poor and lower-middle peasants are satisfied and say, "Our school is run by us, according to our wishes."

Striking Hard at Revolutionary Tradition Education to Cultivate Revolutionary Successors

This school is one with a glorious revolutionary tradition. In 1944, the 22 households living in Yangjiawan, the school's location, had no one who could read or write. Writing a letter or a note required finding someone outside the village to do it. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the village wanted to open a school. At that time, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, who lived in the neighboring village of Yangjialing, paid great attention to the issue of poor and lower-middle peasants' children attending school. Under Chairman Mao's personal care, they sent people to assist the masses in establishing this people-run primary school. At that time, the Party Central Committee organs in Yangjialing even reduced their office supplies and donated seven or eight sets of desks and chairs to this school. When the Chiang-Kuomintang bandits invaded Yan'an, most of the desks and chairs were destroyed, leaving only one set that was kept in the homes of the masses. After the school was reopened, this set of simple desks and chairs was used as a living teaching material for revolutionary tradition education. Every time the school opens, it brings the newly enrolled students to these desks and chairs, tells the story of their origin, and educates the students to remember Chairman Mao's boundless concern for the poor and lower-middle peasants, cultivating a deep proletarian love for Chairman Mao from a young age. At the same time, it makes the students understand that the Chiang-Kuomintang bandits are a bunch of villains, strengthening the students' hatred for the class enemy and forever remembering the blood and tears of the past. In addition, the board of directors also invites old Red Army soldiers from the August 1st Respect-the-Elderly Home to tell stories of class struggle and the Long March of the Red Army. They often organize students to visit the poor, ask about their hardships, invite deeply wronged old poor peasants to tell their family histories and village histories, and invite old students to tell the school's history. Two members of the current board of directors are poor and lower-middle peasant community members who once studied at this school, and they often use the glorious history of this school to educate the next generation to inherit and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Yan'an.

Now, more than 80% of the young and middle-aged people in Yangjiawan and Dujia Gully have received primary education and undergone revolutionary tradition education at this school. Among these people, excluding those who have gone out to work or continued their studies, most have participated in agricultural production and become new-style farmers with socialist consciousness and culture in the production teams. Many of the study group leaders of Chairman Mao's works, propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and key cadres of the brigades and production teams are students cultivated by this school.

Advancing Under the Guidance of Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions

After the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," reached Yangjiawan Brigade, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were all overjoyed. They immediately followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, summarized their past experiences in running schools, and put forward opinions for further improving Yangjiawan Primary School.

First, firmly grasp the power of school education in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Change the principal responsibility system implemented by the original board of directors to a revolutionary leadership small group composed of representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, and brigade revolutionary cadres, to lead and manage the school in the long term.

Second, follow Chairman Mao's great directive to "shorten the school system and revolutionize education," thoroughly smash the old educational system. According to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the school adds a senior class, offering courses in Chairman Mao's quotations, arithmetic, agricultural basics, and military physical education. Thoroughly reform old textbooks and old teaching methods, and further closely combine teaching with practice.

Third, seriously implement Chairman Mao's directive that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." Poor and lower-middle peasants become teachers, occupy the lectern, and teach students about class struggle and production struggle; teachers and students go to the mountains and fields, regularly participate in productive labor, actively participate in social activities, receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and cultivate the excellent qualities of loving Chairman Mao, loving the poor and lower-middle peasants, and loving labor.

    坚持毛主席无产阶级教育路线的一所民办小学
    ——延安县河庄坪公社杨家湾小学调查
    延安县河庄坪公社杨家湾小学，是一九四四年在党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀下创办的一所民办小学。杨家湾小学从创办以来，贫下中农坚决遵循毛主席的教导，牢牢掌握住学校教育大权，继承和发扬了毛主席在延安时的优良办学革命传统，为农村培养了一批接一批的有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。这所学校是全县一所比较出色的民办小学，曾被誉为陕甘宁边区模范民办小学。一九四七年蒋胡匪帮进犯延安时，学校遭到破坏，一度停办。延安光复后，贫下中农又把学校恢复起来。目前，学校有教师两名，学生四十四名。学校从建立到现在，贫下中农始终紧握学校教育的印把子。他们管理学校的办法是，由贫下中农选出校董委员会，然后由校董委员会选出一名负责人管理学校的经常工作。每学期开学、期中、学终，学校负责人和校董委员会向贫下中农汇报教学、学生和经费开支等情况，听取贫下中农对学校的意见，随时改进学校教学管理。
    坚持两条教育路线斗争
    贫下中农掌握学校教育大权，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，抵制中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，废除旧的教育制度和旧的教学方法。一九五七年前后，这个学校先后来过三个旧社会的老学究担任教师。他们采用旧的教法，尽给学生灌输“五虎上将”等神来鬼去的封建毒素，整天让学生坐在窑洞里读“死书”，把一个个学生都教呆了，还诬蔑贫下中农的娃娃是“憨憨”。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的杨家湾贫下中农，一眼就看出这是个方向问题，是关系到依靠什么人来培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的重大问题。他们遵照毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的伟大方针，向这三个老学究提出：“你们要叫学生多参加一点劳动，不要叫学生忘了劳动，不要把学生教成四体不勤、五谷不分的书呆子。”这三个老学究把贫下中农的意见当成了耳边风，还是坚持他们的老一套。贫下中农就开会研究，最后把三个老学究一个个都打发走了。他们重新选拔了优秀的知识青年当教师，贫下中农当顾问，学校面貌焕然一新。在教学内容上，把旧课本换成了毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅教学，武装学生的头脑。为了培养学生的劳动观点和劳动人民的思想感情，增加了劳动课，如组织学生栽树，采集树籽，拾柴，积肥，给军属、五保户抬水、扫院子等，并请贫下中农给学生讲劳动课，把学生带到田间、地头，老农和技术员讲，学生一边学，一边干，使学生把学到的书本知识和生产实际紧密结合起来。教学从农村实际出发，教学生记工、算账、写信、开条子等日用杂文。
    一个时期，学校领导权曾被一个自首变节分子篡夺，这个家伙极力鼓吹中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，妄图把学校引上修正主义的邪路，散布什么城里公办学校“玻璃窗子明晃晃，油漆桌凳亮堂堂，娃娃可以在那里舒舒服服学习，村上的民办学校可以不办了”等谬论。许多贫下中农用土窑洞、旧桌凳培养出的一批批五好社员等事实，批驳了这种说法。他们坚定地说，学校一定要办下去，艰苦朴素的光荣革命传统不能丢！贫下中农把学校的领导权从这个自首变节分子手中夺了回来，坚持了毛主席的无产阶级教育路线和办学方向。
    处处为贫下中农子女入学着想
    为了便利贫下中农子女入学，学校采取以下四种办法：
    一是优先吸收贫下中农子女入学。
    二是教学时间跟农村季节转。农忙放假，农闲多学。平时有忙活，需要学生帮，可以随时请假，因劳动缺的功课，由教师补，同学帮。
    三是允许学生带弟妹上学。有些贫下中农子女多，拖累大，允许他们的子女带着弟弟妹妹一起上学校，一起听课，一起受教育，既解决了学龄儿童的入学问题，又使不少学前儿童受到了学前教育。
    四是换班上学，换班劳动。贫下中农出身的余正明、郭胡林两个学生家里劳力少，生活困难，不能整天上学。他俩就轮换给队上栏羊。今天你上学我栏羊，明天我上学你栏羊，既栏了羊，又上了学。
    由于学校采取上述种种便利贫下中农子女上学的措施，使杨家湾和杜家沟两个大队百分之九十五的贫下中农子女都入了学。贫下中农满意地说：“咱们的学校咱们管，随着咱们的心意办。”
    狠抓革命传统教育　培养革命接班人
    这个学校是一所具有光荣革命传统的学校。一九四四年，学校所在地的杨家湾居住的二十二户人家，没有一个识字的，写个信、开个条子都得出村寻人代写，村里的贫下中农很想办个学校。当年住在邻村杨家岭的党中央和毛主席非常关心贫下中农子女的上学问题，在毛主席的亲切关怀下，派人协助群众创办了这所民办小学。那时住在杨家岭的党中央机关还紧缩机关用具，送给这所学校七、八套桌凳。蒋胡匪帮进犯延安时，大部分桌凳遭到毁坏，仅留下了存在群众家里的一套。学校恢复后，就用这套简陋的桌凳作为向学生进行革命传统教育的活教材。学校每逢开学，都要把新入学的学生带到这套桌凳跟前，讲述这套桌凳的来历，教育学生牢记毛主席对贫下中农的无比关怀，从小就培养学生无限热爱毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情。同时，使学生懂得蒋胡匪帮是一群大坏蛋，增强学生对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，永远牢记血泪仇。此外，校董委员会还请“八一”敬老院的老红军讲阶级斗争和红军长征的故事。经常组织学生访贫问苦，请苦大仇深的老贫农讲家史、村史，请老一辈的学生讲校史。学校现在的校董委员会中就有两名委员是当年在这个学校上过学的贫下中农社员，他们经常用这个学校办学的光荣历史教育下一代继承和发扬延安彻底革命精神。
    现在，杨家湾和杜家沟两个大队，百分之八十以上的青壮年都受到了小学教育，并接受过这个学校的革命传统教育，这些人中，除出外工作和继续升学的外，大部分参加了农业生产，成为生产队有社会主义觉悟的有文化的新式农民。一些学习毛主席著作辅导员、毛泽东思想宣传员和大队、生产队的主要干部，都是这个学校培养出来的学生。
    在毛主席最新指示指引下继续前进
    我们伟大领袖毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示传到杨家湾大队后，广大贫下中农无不欢欣鼓舞。他们立即遵照毛主席的最新指示，总结过去的办学经验，提出了今后进一步办好杨家湾小学的改进意见。
    一、把学校的教育大权牢牢地掌握在贫下中农手里。把原来校董委员会实行的校长负责制改为由贫下中农代表、革命师生代表、大队革命干部组成的三结合革命领导小组，长期领导和管理学校。
    二、遵照毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命”的伟大教导，彻底砸烂旧的教育制度。根据贫下中农的意见，学校增设高级班，开设毛主席语录、算术、农业基础知识和军事体育四门课程。彻底改革旧教材和旧的教学方法，把教学和实际进一步紧密结合起来。
    三、认真贯彻毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的方针。贫下中农当教员，占领讲台，给学生讲阶级斗争和生产斗争课；师生上山下田，定期参加生产劳动，积极参加社会活动，接受贫下中农的再教育，培养无限热爱毛主席、热爱贫下中农、热爱劳动的优良品质。
