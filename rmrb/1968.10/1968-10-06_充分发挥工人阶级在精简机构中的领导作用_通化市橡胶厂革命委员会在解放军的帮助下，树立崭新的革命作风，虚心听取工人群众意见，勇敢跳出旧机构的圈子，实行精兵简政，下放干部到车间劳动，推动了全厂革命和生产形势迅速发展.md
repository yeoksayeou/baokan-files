The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also constantly raise its political consciousness in the struggle."

The revolutionary committee of the T'ung-hua Rubber Factory in Kirin Province closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the factory, it fully exerts the leading role of the working class, humbly listens to the opinions of the working masses, and bravely breaks out of the old organizational framework to implement streamlining and efficiency, establishing a new revolutionary style.

Chairman Mao said, "The working class has the greatest foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." The revolutionary committee of the T'ung-hua Rubber Factory, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, studied the experience of the revolutionary committee of Lin-pao County in implementing streamlining and efficiency and maintaining close ties with the masses, as well as the important editorial note in the People's Daily, and quickly drafted a plan to streamline the organization, assigning factory cadres to the workshops. The committee members went to the workshops to solicit opinions on this plan. Vice Chairman Chou Chia-hsin went to the Molding Workshop and explained the plan. The workers immediately started discussing it. On the spot, the workers raised sharp criticisms, saying, "This is just changing the soup but not the medicine!" "This is just reducing the head but enlarging the belly!" "It's just moving the office chairs around, still being officials and lords!"

The workers' sharp criticisms shocked the committee members. They immediately studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "This time, streamlining and efficiency must be strict, thorough, and universal, not superficial, painless, and partial." They compared the workers' criticisms with their own thoughts and conducted a deep self-examination. Vice Chairman Yao Ching-fa said, "I originally thought that after the reform, if the workshops were not strengthened, the leading cadre would be fewer, and it would be difficult to work without a 'handle'." What kind of 'handle'? The workers exposed the committee's sore spot with one needle. They said, you want to keep a 'handle' now, just to go down to the grassroots level in the future, listen to reports, and when the superior instructions come, just pour them into the workshop, without the need to go deep into the masses and connect with reality! This is the 'handle' of being an official and a lord! The facts prove that the working class has the clearest mind, the brightest eyes, stands the highest, and sees the farthest. They understand Chairman Mao's instructions the deepest and execute them the most resolutely. The revolutionary committee must fully exert the leading role of the working class in all work to have deep roots and leaves, never deviate from the track, and never go off the line. After raising their awareness, they collected the workers' opinions, formulated the plan, and handed it over to the workers for discussion, changing the three-level management into two-level management.

After determining the two-level management, should it be discussed by the workers? There were two opinions: one believed that it was necessary to insist on the workers' supervision, with the workers proposing the plan; the other opinion believed that workers had not been involved in the affairs of the leading cadres in the past and might not understand the workload of each job and the business level of the cadres, so the leaders could first propose the plan and then hand it over to the masses for approval. The propaganda team and the revolutionary committee believed that this was a major issue of whether to insist on the workers' supervision and whether to exert the leading role of the working class at all times. They organized a criticism of the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "the working class may not be reliable at a certain time... do not think that relying on the working class will solve all problems," making everyone establish the view that at any time, it is necessary to firmly exert the leading role of the working class and insist on the principle that "the working class must lead everything." Therefore, the plan for streamlining and efficiency must also be proposed by the workers to better represent the will of the working class and better reflect the leading role of the working class. Because the workers actively offered suggestions to the revolutionary committee, the committee was streamlined from 93 people to 25, and in retaining personnel, the principle of putting proletarian politics in command was strictly adhered to. For example, in the matter of Comrade Ou Kuei-shan taking charge of the accounting work, a fierce debate arose. Ou Kuei-shan was originally a propaganda cadre promoted from the workers, a Communist Party member, and had done general accounting work in the past. At the factory revolutionary committee's discussion meeting, some members were concerned that Ou Kuei-shan's abacus skills were not good, and he could not handle the accounting work, fearing that the factory's business accounting would be messed up. However, the workers said, "Whether one can handle the accounting work or not, one cannot just listen to whether the abacus is loud or not, but see whether the abacus beads are moved towards 'public' or 'private'. Chairman Mao trusts us, the working class, the most. We must make Chairman Mao proud and hold this power firmly." The workers strongly supported Ou Kuei-shan as the accountant. They said with deep feelings: The bad guy who has been exposed by the masses in our factory is indeed an "iron abacus," but he and the capitalist-roaders together pulled our factory towards the capitalist road, and we cannot let those bourgeois lords move our socialist abacus beads again. In this way, the factory revolutionary committee and the broad revolutionary masses, after repeated discussions, determined the person who satisfied the broad revolutionary employees, and smoothly solved the problem of streamlining and efficiency.

The working class understands Chairman Mao's policies the deepest and executes them the most resolutely. They enthusiastically support revolutionary cadres going to the production front line and combining with the workers. The workers in the Vulcanizing Workshop just heard that the technician Sung Chih-hung was going to their workshop, and they immediately started discussing it. Some said, "Welcome him to respond to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, welcome college students to come to production practice." Some actively helped him prepare a box for changing clothes, and some actively arranged for him to get labor protection supplies. After Sung Chih-hung went to the workshop, the workers' first thing was to discuss with him the situation of studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically, making him feel a warm working-class atmosphere as soon as he got off the car, feeling that the working class is indeed the leading class of the revolution. Under the leadership of the working class, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome.

Because the revolutionary employees enthusiastically helped and welcomed the cadres who were streamlined down, the streamlining work proceeded smoothly. Many cadres went to the most arduous and heavy work positions. They closely connected with the masses and humbly learned from the working masses. Some have been elected by the workers as political group leaders or production group leaders of small groups, becoming a powerful backbone force for grasping the revolution and promoting production, pushing the revolutionary and production situation of the entire factory to develop rapidly.

    充分发挥工人阶级在精简机构中的领导作用
    通化市橡胶厂革命委员会在解放军的帮助下，树立崭新的革命作风，虚心听取工人群众意见，勇敢跳出旧机构的圈子，实行精兵简政，下放干部到车间劳动，推动了全厂革命和生产形势迅速发展
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”吉林省通化市橡胶厂革委会紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在驻厂解放军的帮助下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，虚心听取工人群众的意见，勇敢地跳出原来旧机构的圈子，实行了精兵简政，树立了崭新的革命作风。
    毛主席说：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”橡胶厂革委会遵照毛主席的这一指示，学习了灵宝县革委会实行精兵简政、密切联系群众的经验和《人民日报》的重要编者按，很快就拟定了一个精简机构的方案，把厂的干部分到车间。革委会的委员分头下到车间征求对这个方案的意见。副主任周家新到成型车间，把方案一讲，工人们就议论纷纷。群众当场就提出尖锐的批评，说：“这是换汤不换药！”“是削小了脑袋，加大了肚子。”“仅仅把办公凳子挪一挪位置，还是当官做老爷！”群众的尖锐批评，使革委会的同志受到很大震动。于是他们立即学习了毛主席关于“这一次精兵简政，必须是严格的、彻底的、普遍的，而不是敷衍的、不痛不痒的、局部的”的教导，对照工人们的批评，大家深刻地检查了自己的思想。革委会副主任姚静发说：“我原想改革以后，如果车间不加强一下，将来领导班子人少了，工作起来就没有‘把手’。”要什么样的“把手”？工人群众一针见血地揭到了革委会的痛处。他们说，你们现在想留个“把手”，就是为了将来一“深入”下层，就听汇报，上级指示一来，往车间一灌就行了，用不着深入群众，联系实际了！这是做官当老爷的“把手”！事实证明工人阶级心最明、眼最亮、站得高、看得远，对毛主席的指示理解最深，执行最坚决。革委会必须在一切工作中充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，才能根深叶茂，永不脱“轨”，永不离“线”。认识提高以后，他们把工人群众的意见集中起来，订出方案，又交给群众讨论，把三级管理变成两级管理。
    两级管理定下来以后，要不要经过工人群众讨论呢？有两种意见：一种认为，必须坚持工人群众把关，由工人群众提方案；一种意见却认为，工人过去过问领导干部的事不多，对每项工作的工作量和干部的业务水平不一定了解，可以由领导先提出方案，交给群众通过。宣传队和革委会认为，这是能不能始终坚持工人群众把关，能不能处处发挥工人阶级的领导作用的大问题。于是，他们又组织大家批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“工人阶级在一定的时候，也可能有不能依靠的，……不要以为依靠工人阶级就没有问题了”等反动谬论，使大家树立一个观点，在任何时候都要坚定不移地发挥工人阶级的领导作用，在任何时候都要坚持“工人阶级必须领导一切”的原则。因此，精兵简政的方案也必须由工人群众来提，才能更好地代表工人阶级的意志，才能更好地体现工人阶级的领导作用。由于工人们积极地为革委会出谋献策，使革委会由九十三人精简为二十五人，而且在留人上，严格坚持了无产阶级政治挂帅的原则。比如在欧奎山同志担任主管会计工作问题上，就发生了一场激烈的争论。欧奎山原是从工人中提起来的宣传干事，共产党员，过去做过一般性的会计工作。在厂革命委员会的讨论会上，有的成员担心欧奎山算盘打得不好，拿不起会计工作，怕把厂里的经营核算搞乱了。可是工人群众说：“能不能胜任会计工作，不能光听算盘打得响不响，要看他的算盘珠是往‘公’字上拨，还是往‘私’字上拨。毛主席最相信我们工人阶级，我们要为毛主席争气，把这个权掌得牢牢的。”工人群众十分支持欧奎山当会计。他们深有体会地说：我们厂里已被群众揪出来的一个坏家伙那倒是个“铁算盘”，可他和走资派一起把我们工厂往资本主义道路上拉，再不能让那些资产阶级老爷拨动我们社会主义的算盘珠了。就这样，厂革委会和广大革命群众经过反复讨论，定下了广大革命职工满意的人，顺利解决了精兵简政问题。
    工人阶级，对于毛主席的政策理解得最深、执行得最坚决，他们热情支持革命干部走上生产第一线，同工人相结合。炼胶车间的工人们刚刚听说技术员宋志洪要下到他们车间，就积极研究起来，有的说：“欢迎他响应毛主席的最新指示，欢迎大学生到生产实践中来。”有的积极帮他做了换工作服的箱子，有的积极张罗着给他领劳动保护用品。宋志洪到车间后，工人们第一件事就是同他一起交谈活学活用毛主席著作的情况，使他一下车间，就感到一股工人阶级的温暖，感到工人阶级真正是革命的领导阶级，在工人阶级领导下，没有克服不了的困难。
    由于革命职工热情帮助和欢迎精简下去的干部，使精简工作顺利进行。不少干部都到最艰苦、最繁重的工作岗位上去。他们紧密联系群众，虚心向工人群众学习。有的已被工人选为小组的政治组长或生产组长，成为抓革命、促生产的一支强大的骨干力量，推动全厂革命生产形势迅速发展。          本报通讯员
