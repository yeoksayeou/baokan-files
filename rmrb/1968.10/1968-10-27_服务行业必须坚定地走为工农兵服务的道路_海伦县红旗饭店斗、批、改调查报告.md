The Service Industry Must Firmly Walk the Path of Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
Investigation Report on the Struggle, Criticism, and Reform of the Red Flag Hotel in Heilong County

In the old society, hotels mainly served the exploiting classes. After liberation, many hotels, under the guidance of the revisionist line, became places where feudal, capitalist, and revisionist ideas ran rampant. To fundamentally change this situation and firmly walk the path of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers is the direction of the struggle, criticism, and reform in the hotel industry.

With the help of the county revolutionary committee and the county people's armed forces department's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the hotel, the Red Flag Hotel in Heilong County, relying on the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly criticized and repudiated the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, firmly established Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, and achieved remarkable results in the struggle, criticism, and reform.

A New-Type Hotel Loved by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

The Red Flag Hotel always keeps workers, peasants, and soldiers in mind. The mass meals they serve are affordable and delicious, and workers, peasants, and soldiers like to eat them and can afford them. In the past, they served high-class dishes like "prawn silk," "scallion-braised sea cucumber," and "hot pot," costing several, tens, or even hundreds of yuan per dish. Who among the workers and peasants could afford that? Even if they could, they wouldn't spend so much money. Only the bourgeoisie could enjoy such luxuries. Now, they serve mass meals, considering the needs of workers, peasants, and soldiers, offering rice, steamed buns, fried dough twists, and various small dishes. A meal costs only a few jiao, and everyone can eat to their heart's content. The broad masses of workers and peasants say: "This is truly a hotel that serves us well!"

The Red Flag Hotel always considers the convenience of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, they conducted in-depth investigations and research among workers and peasants, reforming unreasonable regulations based on their needs. In the past, buying tickets, serving dishes, and fetching meals all required queuing, and it took one or two hours to eat a meal. The masses were very dissatisfied, saying, "Three lines as soon as you enter, you get tired before you even eat." Now, they have initially understood the patterns of workers and peasants eating out, serving meals to the tables, and there is no need to queue anymore. Workers and peasants are satisfied, saying, "As soon as you enter, you are seated, and the food is served quickly and hot." In the past, they waited for customers at the door. Now, they go out to serve, often delivering meals to many places such as truck depots, grain stations, and hospitals. In the past, they operated like a government office: they opened when everyone was at work and closed when everyone was off work. Now, they start work early and finish late.

The revolutionary staff of the Red Flag Hotel all love workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past, under the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Khrushchev, the hotel prioritized making money and profits, adulterating food, and giving less than the actual weight. Everything was for money, money, and more money. In 1961, to make money, they sold spoiled sausage to customers. They treated people differently based on their appearance, smiling at those who dressed well and ignoring workers and peasants. They had a set of service rules: "Treat city people finely, treat rural people coarsely, treat frequent customers well, and treat superiors in the back room." Now, they treat workers, peasants, and soldiers as their own family, ensuring that every dish and meal serves the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary staff members personally oversee everything, striving for excellence. A service staff member saw an elderly community member eating two fried dough twists dry, immediately mixed soy sauce and green onions into a bowl of hot soup, and served it to him. Once, a community member's coat button fell off, and the service staff member took a button from their own coat and sewed it on. The poor peasant said, "You didn't just sew on a coat button for me; you sewed on the spirit of selflessness."

The revolutionary staff of the Red Flag Hotel regard propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their most sacred duty and the fundamental way to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the walls here had pictures of "Zhang Guo Lao riding a donkey backwards," and the menu had items like "mandarin duck box" and "lama cake." Now, as soon as customers enter, they see Chairman Mao's glorious image, hear his latest instructions, and receive education in Mao Zedong Thought. The hotel staff often conduct revolutionary criticism together with customers, turning the dining hall into a battlefield for revolutionary criticism and a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Transformation of the Red Flag Hotel

How did the Red Flag Hotel achieve such great changes? The revolutionary staff here all say that it was achieved through the struggle between the two lines and through revolutionary criticism.

In implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform, the Red Flag Hotel first encountered sabotage and disruption from the capitalist roaders in the service industry and a handful of class enemies inside and outside the hotel. As soon as mass meals appeared, a handful of class enemies eagerly jumped out, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion and engaging in destructive activities. They shouted, "You are just seeking fame, riding the wave, and the rabbit's tail won't last long." The revolutionary committee organized the staff to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle," criticizing Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," raising the staff's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, exposing the cover of class struggle, and uncovering the class enemies hiding in the revolutionary ranks, thus timely smashing their counter-revolutionary plots.

The struggle, criticism, and reform of the Red Flag Hotel encountered not only sabotage and disruption from class enemies but also interference and resistance from old habits and the "self" in people's minds with every step forward.

Some staff members thought that carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform, serving mass meals, starting work early, finishing late, and having many customers but not making money was not worth it. The broad masses of workers in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes conducted bitter-sweet reminiscences, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "wholeheartedly serve the people," criticizing Khrushchev's fallacies of "money first" and "material incentives," and criticizing the "self" in their own minds. They said, "We run a hotel for the revolution, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, serving the people. Only capitalists run hotels for money. Let Khrushchev's stinking idea of money first go to hell."

Some staff members thought that mass meals were something that housewives could make, that there was nothing to learn, and that even if there were skills, they were not useful and had no future, requesting to be transferred out of the hotel. They did their work half-heartedly, causing the mass meals to have a single variety and poor quality for a period. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "without the correct political viewpoint, one is like a soul-less body," holding a great debate on "whether politics comes first or technology comes first," and criticizing bourgeois ideas of fame and success. From then on, mass meals were refined to perfection. A worker comrade praised, "I came to Heilong for the revolution, and the mass meals are to my liking; high quality, low price, delicious, wholeheartedly serving the people."

The practice of the struggle between the two lines made the comrades of the Red Flag Hotel deeply realize that if the line is not clear, the direction will not be clear, and if the "self" is not overcome, the direction will not be guaranteed. Only by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step, running through revolutionary criticism in the struggle, criticism, and reform, and carrying out the ideological revolution of the people, can the battle of struggle, criticism, and reform be won.

From the Transformation of the Red Flag Hotel to the Direction of Struggle, Criticism, and Reform in the Service Industry

The transformation of the Red Flag Hotel has shown the direction of struggle, criticism, and reform in the service industry.

First, insist on the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao said, "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Serving workers, peasants, and soldiers or serving a few bourgeoisie is the fundamental question of whether the service industry walks the socialist road or the capitalist road. The service industry must carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end. It must firmly establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. The varieties of goods and services must be what workers, peasants, and soldiers need and welcome. The reform of regulations and the layout of service points must take the convenience of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the starting point and end goal.

Second, establish a team of staff who wholeheartedly serve the people and the revolution, possessing great communist spirit. The current staff of the service industry are complex. Old thoughts, old habits, and old styles are relatively serious. Thoroughly reforming the current team requires sending Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to the service industry, arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly exposing the cover of class struggle, and firmly expelling a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists from the staff team. Strengthen ideological education for the entire staff team. Select a group of proletarian revolutionary rebels who have been tempered and tested in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and send them to the service industry. Through means such as establishing "May 7th" cadre schools, make the staff of the service industry frequently participate in industrial and agricultural labor production, constantly reforming their worldview.

Third, the leadership must be firmly in the hands of the working class. The Red Flag Hotel achieved remarkable results in the struggle, criticism, and reform, the key being a good leading group. Among the seven members of the Red Flag Hotel revolutionary committee, six are workers. The seven members all work in shifts, relying on the masses to democratically manage the enterprise. Currently, some units in the service industry have impure, incomplete, and weak leading groups, and some units' leading groups are still the old ones. Strengthening the leadership of the working class over the service industry requires further consolidating and developing the revolutionary committees. The members of the revolutionary committees must be models of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on highlighting proletarian politics, using revolution to guide production, insisting on working in shifts, maintaining close ties with the masses, and always placing themselves under the supervision of the masses, "organizing a revolutionary leading group that is connected with the masses," and establishing the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought.

    服务行业必须坚定地走为工农兵服务的道路
    海伦县红旗饭店斗、批、改调查报告
    在旧社会，饭店主要是为剥削阶级服务的。解放后，仍然有不少饭店，在修正主义路线的经营方针下，成了封、资、修泛滥的场所。从根本上改变这种状况，坚定地走为工农兵服务的道路，是饭店斗、批、改的方向。
    海伦县红旗饭店，在县革命委员会和县人民武装部驻店毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，紧紧依靠广大革命群众，大破反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，斗、批、改取得了显著成效。
    一个工农兵喜爱的新型饭店
    红旗饭店事事惦记着工农兵。他们经营的大众饭菜，花钱不多，实惠可口，工农兵喜欢吃，也吃得起。过去经营的是高级饭菜，什么“虾仁吐丝”、“葱烧海参”、“火锅子”等等，几元、十几元甚至几十元一个菜，工农兵谁吃得起？就是吃得起也不花这个大头钱，只能供资产阶级老爷享受。现在经营大众饭菜，处处从工农兵需要出发，有米饭、馒头、麻花，各种小菜，一顿饭花几角钱，就吃个响饱。广大工农兵说：这真是为咱们服务的好饭店！
    红旗饭店处处方便工农兵。他们遵照毛主席的教导，深入工农兵调查研究，根据工农兵的需要，改革了不合理的规章制度。以前，买票、端菜、拿饭，都得排队，吃一顿饭就得一、两个小时。群众很反感地说：“一进门三条线，没等吃饭心就厌。”现在，初步摸清了工农兵用饭的规律，服务到桌头，再也不用排队了。工农兵满意地说：“一进门就让座，吃得又快又热乎。”以前是守门待客，现在走出门去服务，经常把饭送到大车店、粮点、医院等许多地方。以前是“机关式”营业：大家上班我营业，大家下班我闭店。现在是早上班，晚下班。
    红旗饭店革命职工人人热爱工农兵。过去，在中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线毒害下，饭店是卖钱第一，利润第一，掺糠施假，少斤短两，一切为了钱、钱、钱。一九六一年，为了赚钱，把变质的蛋肠卖给顾客。他们看人下菜碟，看穿戴好的就笑脸相迎，见着工农兵，怠搭不理。他们有一套服务经：“城里人要细，乡下人要粗，常来常往要照顾，顶头上司请到后屋。”现在，把工农兵当成自己的亲人，一菜一饭都坚持为工农兵服务的方向，革命职工人人把关，精益求精。服务员看到一位老社员买了两根麻花干吃起来，就立即用酱油和葱花对了一碗热汤，端给他。一次，一位社员的大衣掉了一个扣子，服务员就把自己的大衣扣揪下，给他钉上。那位贫下中农感动地说：“你给我钉的不是一个大衣扣，是给我钉上了毫不利己专门利人的精神。”
    红旗饭店革命职工把宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，当作自己最神圣的职责和为工农兵服务的根本。无产阶级文化大革命之前，这里，墙上挂的是“张果老倒骑驴”，食谱上写着“鸳鸯盒子”，“喇嘛糕”。现在顾客一进门，看到的是毛主席的光辉形象，听到的是毛主席的最新指示，受到的是毛泽东思想教育。饭店职工经常同顾客一起，开展革命大批判，营业室成了革命大批判的战场，成了活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂。
    两条路线斗争的产物
    红旗饭店的巨大变革是怎样来的？这里的革命职工都说，是在两条路线斗争中斗出来的，是革命大批判批出来的。
    红旗饭店在落实毛主席认真搞好斗、批、改这一最新指示的过程中，首先遇到了服务业的走资派和店内外一小撮阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱。大众饭菜一出现，一小撮阶级敌人就迫不及待地跳了出来，大造反革命舆论，大搞破坏活动。叫嚣什么“你们出风头，赶浪头，兔子尾巴长不了”。革委会组织职工办了毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”等教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，提高了革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，大揭了阶级斗争盖子，揪出了混在革命队伍中的阶级敌人，及时粉碎了他们的反革命阴谋。
    红旗饭店的斗、批、改，每前进一步不仅遇到阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，还遇到旧习惯势力和人们头脑里“私”字的干扰和抵抗。
    有的职工认为，搞斗、批、改，搞大众饭菜，上班早，下班晚，顾客多，还不赚钱。广大职工在毛泽东思想学习班里，大搞忆苦思甜，遵照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等谬论，大造了自己头脑中“私”字的反。他们说：“我们办饭店是为革命办饭店，要用毛泽东思想挂帅，为人民服务。只有资本家才为了挣钱。叫中国赫鲁晓夫金钱挂帅的臭思想见鬼去吧。”
    有的职工认为，大众饭菜，家庭妇女都会做，学不到啥手艺，就是有手艺也用不上，没啥出息，要求调出这个饭店。工作对对付付，使大众饭菜一度品种单一，质量下降。他们反复学习了毛主席关于“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”的教导，展开了“是政治第一，还是技术第一”的大辩论，狠批了资产阶级成名成家的思想。从此，大众饭菜精益求精。一位工人同志赞扬说：“我为革命来海伦，大众饭菜随我心；质高价廉味可口，全心全意为人民。”
    两条路线斗争的实践，使红旗饭店的同志们深切地体会到，路线分不清，方向就不明，“私”字斗不倒，方向就难保。只有步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把革命大批判贯穿斗、批、改的始终，搞好人的思想革命化，才能打好斗、批、改这一仗。
    从红旗饭店的变革看服务行业斗、批、改的方向
    红旗饭店发生的变革，已展现出服务行业斗、批、改的方向。
    一、坚持为工农兵服务的方向。毛主席说：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”为工农兵服务，还是为资产阶级少数人服务，是服务行业走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路的根本问题。服务行业必须将“无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”进行到底。必须牢固地树立起全心全意为工农兵服务的思想。经营的品种和服务的项目，必须是工农兵所需要、所欢迎的。规章制度的改革和网点布局，必须以有利于工农兵为出发点和归宿。
    二、建立一支一心为人民，一心为革命的具有伟大共产主义精神的职工队伍。服务行业现有的职工队伍，人员复杂。旧思想、旧习惯、旧作风比较严重。彻底改造现有队伍，需要派毛泽东思想宣传队到服务行业，用毛泽东思想武装群众，彻底揭开阶级斗争的盖子，把一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，坚决清洗出职工队伍，加强对整个职工队伍的思想教育。抽调一批经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼和考验的无产阶级革命造反派，充实到服务行业中去。通过举办“五·七”干校等途径，使服务行业职工经常参加工农业生产劳动，不断改造自己的世界观。
    三、领导权必须牢牢掌握在工人阶级手里。红旗饭店在斗、批、改中取得了显著成效，关键在于有一个好的领导班子。红旗饭店革命委员会七名委员中有六名是工人。七名委员都跟班劳动，依靠群众民主管理企业。现在服务行业有的单位的领导班子，不纯，不齐，不力，有些单位领导班子仍然是旧班底。加强工人阶级对服务行业的领导，必须进一步巩固和发展革命委员会。革命委员会成员必须做活学活用毛泽东思想的模范，坚持突出无产阶级政治，用革命统帅生产。坚持跟班劳动，密切联系群众，永远置身于群众的监督之下，“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，确立毛泽东思想的统帅权。
