The arrival of Albanian comrades brought joy to the entire village of Shaoshan. Workers with a glorious revolutionary tradition, poor and lower-middle peasants, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaoshan, and Red Guards enthusiastically welcomed the Albanian comrades. They held high portraits of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, waved the national flags of China and Albania, beat drums and gongs, and chanted slogans, warmly welcoming the Albanian comrades. At the entrance of Shaoshan village, Albanian comrades and the welcoming crowd together shouted, "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The Albanian comrades visited Chairman Mao's former residence and the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence. They inquired in detail about Chairman Mao's studies, labor, and revolutionary activities during his youth. They were also very happy to take photos with the welcoming crowd in front of Chairman Mao's former residence and the statue of Chairman Mao.

The Albanian comrades left a revolutionary friendship inscription after visiting Shaoshan. The inscription read: Visiting Chairman Mao's former residence makes us feel extremely proud and gives us unwavering confidence to struggle for the cause of socialism and communism worldwide. We will convey the profound impressions we gained from this visit to the Albanian people.

The inscription also read: All the glorious victories of the great revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people—the establishment of the glorious Communist Party of China, the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the founding of the great People's Republic of China, the establishment and consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the brilliant achievements in all sectors of the national economy—are all closely linked with the name of Comrade Mao Zedong.

The inscription further stated: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, smashed the capitalist reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, foiled the plots of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and kept China red and shining.

The inscription also praised Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha as the creators of the great, fraternal, and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and Albania.

The Albanian comrades also visited the Shaoshan Railway Station. After returning to Changsha from Shaoshan, they attended a cultural evening hosted by the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee to welcome them.
