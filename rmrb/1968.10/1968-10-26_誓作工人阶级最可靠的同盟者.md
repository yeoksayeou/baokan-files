We deeply respect Comrade Jiang Qing, who, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, personally led revolutionary cultural workers with unyielding revolutionary will. They broke through the numerous obstacles of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and carried out a thorough revolution in ballet art. They transformed this foreign art form to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to serve proletarian politics, and to serve socialism. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

In the past, I also watched the film "White-Haired Girl." After watching it, I felt very frustrated. Yang Bailao drank poison and committed suicide, Xi'er was mistreated, and Daqing was driven away... The revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl" is completely different. It portrays the spirit of us poor and lower-middle peasants. This ballet reflects our revolutionary struggles and praises us poor and lower-middle peasants. The characters Yang Bailao, Zhao Dadou, Wang Daqing, and Xi'er do what we think, their hatred is our hatred, their hearts are closely tied to ours, and every movement they make expresses the class feelings of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Xi'er, Wang Daqing, and Zhao Dadou are truly exemplary. Their spirit of fearlessness in the face of tyranny and daring to fight has greatly boosted our poor and lower-middle peasants' morale and crushed the arrogance of the landlord and bourgeoisie. This ballet vividly illustrates that we poor and lower-middle peasants are the most reliable allies of the working class.

In the old society, which family of poor and lower-middle peasants did not have a history of blood and tears? Take me for example, I lost my mother at the age of four, my younger sister starved to death, and at the age of seven, I became a maid for the landlord and suffered endless torment. Xi'er in the play is so much like me. The more I watch, the more I hate the landlord class and the evil old society; the more I watch, the more I love our great leader Chairman Mao. "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao." If it were not for Chairman Mao leading the revolution, how many Xi'ers would have been pushed into the fire, and how many Yang Bailaos would have died at the hands of Huang Shiren! If it were not for the Eighth Route Army led by Chairman Mao to liberate our fellow villagers and overthrow Huang Shiren, how could thousands and thousands of Xi'ers become masters of their own fate! From this, I deeply understand how correct Chairman Mao's teaching of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is! We poor and lower-middle peasants, only by standing together with the working class, becoming the most reliable allies of the working class, firmly holding the gun, firmly holding the seal, firmly holding the pen, and never forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, can we truly become masters of our own fate.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao pointed out more than twenty years ago: "In China, the poor peasants, including hired laborers, make up about seventy percent of the rural population. The poor peasants are the broad masses of farmers who have no land or insufficient land, and are the semi-proletariat in the rural areas. They are the most extensive force of the Chinese revolution, the natural and most reliable allies of the proletariat, and the main force of the Chinese revolutionary army." This is the highest honor Chairman Mao has given to us poor and lower-middle peasants, and it is also Chairman Mao's greatest trust, greatest education, and greatest encouragement to us. We poor and lower-middle peasants have only one heart, which is loyal to Chairman Mao; only one thought, which is loyal to Mao Zedong Thought; and only one line, which is loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Looking back at the struggles in our rural areas over the past decade or so since liberation, whether it was fighting against landlords and redistributing land, or cooperativization and people's communes, or the great socialist education movement, every struggle and every victory was achieved under the leadership of Chairman Mao. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with our loyalty to Chairman Mao, followed Chairman Mao's instructions, smashed the counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line time and time again, and exposed big and small capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries. Through the test of the struggle between the two lines, our proletarian consciousness has been raised, and our stance has become firmer. We poor and lower-middle peasants will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations. We pledge to be the most reliable allies of the working class, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, do a good job in the great criticism, clean up the class ranks, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, seize the revolution, promote production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    誓作工人阶级最可靠的同盟者
    北京市农代会常委、房山县农代会核心组长　张凤兰
    我们敬爱的江青同志，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，亲自率领革命的文艺战士，以百折不挠的革命毅力，冲破了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的重重阻挠，对芭蕾艺术进行了彻底的革命，使芭蕾舞这个洋的艺术形式，用来为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义服务，这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！
    过去，我也看过电影《白毛女》。看后很觉闷气，杨白劳喝卤水自杀了，喜儿给糟踏了，大春也给赶跑了……。革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》大不同了，它把咱们贫下中农的骨气给演出来了。这个舞剧是反映我们贫下中农的革命斗争的，是歌颂我们贫下中农的。戏中的杨白劳、赵大叔、王大春和喜儿，他们做的就是我们心里想的，他们的恨就是我们的恨，他们的心和我们的心紧贴在一块，他们的每个动作都表现了我们贫下中农的阶级感情。喜儿、王大春、赵大叔真是好样的，他们不畏强暴，敢于斗争的精神，大长了我们贫下中农的志气，大灭了地主资产阶级的威风。这个舞剧，生动地说明了：我们贫下中农是工人阶级的最可靠的同盟军。
    我们贫下中农在旧社会，哪家没有一部血泪史。就拿我来说吧，我四岁没妈，妹妹活活饿死，我七岁给地主当丫头，受尽煎熬。戏里的喜儿多么象我啊，我越看越痛恨地主阶级，痛恨万恶的旧社会；越看越热爱我们的伟大领袖毛主席。“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”。要不是毛主席他老人家领导闹革命，多少喜儿要被推进火海，多少个杨白劳要死在黄世仁手下！要不是毛主席领导的八路军解放乡亲们，打倒黄世仁，千千万万个喜儿那能翻身作主人呢！从这里我更加体会到毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导是多么正确啊！我们贫下中农，只有和工人阶级站在一起，作工人阶级最可靠的同盟者，握紧枪杆子，抓牢印把子，握紧笔杆子，念念不忘无产阶级专政，才能彻底翻身作主人。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席早在二十多年前就指出：“中国的贫农，连同雇农在内，约占农村人口百分之七十。贫农是没有土地或土地不足的广大的农民群众，是农村中的半无产阶级，是中国革命的最广大的动力，是无产阶级的天然的和最可靠的同盟者，是中国革命队伍的主力军。”这是毛主席给我们贫下中农最高的荣誉，也是毛主席对我们最大的信任、最大的教育、最大的鼓舞。我们贫下中农，只有一条心，就是忠于毛主席的红心；只有一个思想，就是忠于毛泽东思想；只有一条线，就是忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    回顾我们农村解放十几年来的斗争历程，不管是斗地主分田地，也不管是合作化和人民公社化或是伟大的社会主义教育运动，每一场斗争，每一次胜利，都是在毛主席的领导下取得的。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们广大贫下中农，凭着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，遵照毛主席的指示，冲垮了资产阶级反动路线一次又一次的反扑，揪出了大大小小的走资派、叛徒、特务、反革命。经过两条路线斗争的考验，我们贫下中农的无产阶级觉悟更高了，立场更坚定了。我们贫下中农决不辜负毛主席他老人家对我们的期望，我们誓作工人阶级最可靠的同盟者，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，搞好革命的大批判，清理好阶级队伍，认真搞好斗、批、改，抓好革命，促好生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
