A certain hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has successfully developed a "June 26" type miniature ion-exchange water purifier. This is a major innovation in the field of liquid preparation, achieved by white-clad soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who followed Chairman Mao's great teachings of "wholeheartedly serving the people" and "shifting the focus of medical and health work to rural areas" through repeated practice.

By replacing the distillation apparatus with an ion-exchange water purifier and distilled water with ion-exchange water, favorable conditions have been created to solve the long-standing problem of the lack of distillation apparatus and distilled water in rural medical and health work.

Currently, the "June 26" type miniature ion-exchange water purifier is being used in some units and hospitals of the Guangzhou Military Region. This type of miniature ion-exchange water purifier has the following advantages: First, it has a simple structure, is small and light, weighing only one-fourth of the distillation apparatus, and costs only one-third of the general distillation apparatus; it can be self-manufactured by general rural health stations. Second, it is convenient to operate, does not require fuel, is not restricted by the environment, and can produce qualified injection water as long as it is connected to a water source. The production efficiency is also high, and the water quality is even purer than general distilled water. Due to the above advantages, it can be widely promoted and used in rural medical units.

In the past, distilled water used in medical and health work as well as in industrial machinery and instruments was all made with distillation apparatus. However, the distillation apparatus has a complex structure, high cost, and its use is restricted by many conditions. But distilled water has a wide range of uses, so how to solve this contradiction has long been a concern.

At the end of last year, the hospital of this division had sent medical teams several times to provide treatment in rural areas. The lack of distillation apparatus and distilled water in many commune health stations and rural medical teams greatly inspired them to solve this long-standing problem in rural areas. They decided to trial-manufacture an ion-exchange water purifier.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the hospital of this division finally developed the first miniature ion-exchange water purifier. The ion-exchange water produced by this ion-exchange water purifier fully meets the requirements for injection water. After continuous improvement, the ion-exchange water purifier has been preliminarily finalized and is now in small-scale production.

    广州部队某医院制成微型去离子纯水器
    人民解放军广州部队某师医院试制成功一种“六·二六”型微型去离子纯水器。这是用毛泽东思想武装起来的白衣战士，遵循毛主席
  “全心全意地为人民服务”和“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的伟大教导，经过反复实践，在制液工作上完成的一项重大革新。以去离子纯水器代替蒸馏器，以去离子水代替蒸馏水，就为解决农村的医疗卫生工作中无蒸馏器、无蒸馏水的“老大难”问题创造了有利条件。
    目前，“六·二六”型微型去离子纯水器，已在广州部队一些部队、医院中使用。这种微型去离子纯水器有如下一些优点：一、结构简单，小而轻，重量只有蒸馏器的四分之一，造价只是一般蒸馏器的三分之一；一般农村卫生院可以自制；二、操作方便，不需要燃料，不受环境的限制，只要接上水源即可制出合格的注射用水，生产效率也高，水质比一般蒸馏水还纯。由于有上述优点，可以在农村医疗单位广泛推广使用。
    医药卫生工作以及工业机器、仪器所用的蒸馏水，过去都用蒸馏器制作。而蒸馏器结构复杂，造价很高，使用受到许多条件的限制。但是蒸馏水用途又很广，因此，怎样解决这个矛盾，早已引起人们的重视。
    去年年底，这个师的医院曾几次派出医疗队，深入农村巡回治疗。许多公社卫生院和农村医疗队缺少蒸馏器、蒸馏水的情况，大大激发了他们解决农村这一“老大难”问题的斗志，他们决心试制去离子纯水器。
    在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，这个师的医院终于制成了第一台微型去离子纯水器。以这台去离子纯水器制作的去离子水，完全合乎注射用水的要求。经过不断改进，去离子纯水器已初步定型，并已小批生产。
