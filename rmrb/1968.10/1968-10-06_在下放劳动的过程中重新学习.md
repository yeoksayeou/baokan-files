In recent times, Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Broad masses of cadres should go to the countryside to labor, this is an excellent opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also go in batches to labor." Through the past two years of frequently going among the masses to participate in labor, I have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's words are indeed the absolute truth.

At the beginning of last year, our air transport cargo volume increased significantly. The bureau party committee assigned me to focus on the transportation service department's work. After going down, I decided to participate in the loading and unloading work, on one hand to help them solve some problems, and on the other hand to temper myself through labor. Initially, the worker comrades always treated me politely as the bureau chief, not letting me handle heavy goods. I thought, since I came to labor, why do the workers still treat me this way? Finding the reason, it was because I had not completely put down my airs; when loading goods, I was dressed neatly, and it was obvious that I did not look like a laborer; when lifting goods, I was awkward and not natural. How could I truly establish a relationship with the worker comrades this way? I decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, completely put down my airs, and sincerely become an ordinary loader. From then on, wherever the work was heavy and wherever it was tough, I went there and worked together with everyone.

Last summer, the cargo volume surged, and the tasks were very heavy. One noon, three planes were parked, and the loading and unloading volume was relatively large. After working for a morning, my waist and back ached, and my body felt uncomfortable. After eating lunch, I had just lain down on the bed to rest when I heard the sounds of the transportation service department comrades loading goods downstairs. At this moment, I had a fierce struggle in my mind: should I continue to rest or go to labor? I thought, my age is relatively old, and my physical strength is also weaker than theirs. I have already worked for a morning, and it is reasonable to rest for a while. However, the sounds of the comrades downstairs loading goods, especially their reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, kept coming, and I could no longer sleep. I immediately got out of bed and ran downstairs to work with the comrades. That day, we sent off eight planes and continuously loaded and unloaded fifteen tons of cargo.

Through this period of labor practice, I learned a lot from the worker comrades, and my relationship with the masses gradually became closer, and my class feelings deepened. When loading and unloading goods, the loader comrades would call me, "Hey, move this cargo over there." "Hey! Move that cargo over here." Everyone was very casual and affectionate. When working in the cabin, sometimes I couldn't help, so I picked up a banana leaf fan and fanned for the comrades. When it was my turn to move the cargo, they also fanned for me. This small fan, although it couldn't lower the temperature, made us feel especially comfortable in our hearts. This was not just a cool breeze; it was the exchange of feelings among the laboring people, the wind of mutual care and concern among class brothers. It helps us overcome bureaucratism and maintain the character of the laboring people.

I was born into a poor peasant family and became a child worker for the capitalists at the age of thirteen. In 1945, I joined the army. Although I later became a cadre, I always lived with the soldiers. During marches, I carried guns for the soldiers, and during camps, I fetched water for the soldiers to wash their feet. This allowed me to learn a lot from the laboring people and ordinary soldiers, always maintaining the character of a revolutionary soldier. After entering the city, the environment changed from war to peace, my position was promoted, my salary increased, and my life became better and better. Under the influence of the revisionist thoughts spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, over the past decade, I gradually became detached from the laboring masses. This is a very dangerous thing! The great proletarian cultural revolution has touched my soul, allowing me to return to the ordinary soldiers and frequently labor with them. This is truly an excellent opportunity for me to learn anew from them. I am determined not to disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's sincere expectations and care, to study Mao Zedong Thought well in labor, and to forever maintain the vigorous revolutionary youth of the proletariat.

    在下放劳动的过程中重新学习
    民航江苏省局局长　刘金福
    毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”我通过最近两年经常到群众里面去参加劳动，深切体会到毛主席的话是千真万确的真理。
    去年年初，我们民航客货运量大幅度增长，局党委分工我重点抓一抓运输服务室的工作。下去以后，我决定参加搬运工作，一方面帮助他们解决一些问题；一方面通过参加劳动来锻炼自己。起初，工人同志总是客客气气地把我当局长照顾，不让我搬重货。我想，既然我是来劳动的，为什么工人还这样对待我呢？找找原因，是自己还没有放下架子，搬货时，穿的整整齐齐，人家一看就不象个劳动的样子；搬起货来也是别别扭扭不象个样。这样下去怎么能和工人同志真正建立感情呢？我决心遵照毛主席的教导，彻底放下架子，踏踏实实地当一名普通的搬运工。从那以后，那里活重，那里艰苦，我就到那里去，和大家一起抢着干。
    去年夏天，客货运量猛增，任务非常繁重。一天中午，有三架飞机停场，装卸量比较大。干了一上午之后，腰痠背痛，身体有些不舒服。吃过午饭，我刚躺在床上休息，就听到楼下运输服务室的同志在搬货的声音。这时，我思想上展开了激烈的斗争，是继续休息，还是去参加劳动？我想，我的年龄比较大，体力也比他们差，已经干了一上午了，休息一会也是应该的。但是，楼下同志们搬货的吆喝声，特别是他们背诵毛主席语录的声音，不断地传来，我再也睡不下去了，立刻翻身下床，跑下楼去，和同志们一道干起来。那天，我们共送走了八架飞机，连续装卸了十五吨货物。
    经过这一段劳动实践的锻炼，我向工人同志学习了不少东西，和群众的关系也逐渐密切了，阶级感情也深厚了。在装卸货物的时候，搬运工人同志叫我：“喂，把这个货搬过去。”“喂！把那个货搬过来。”大家很随便，很亲热。在机舱里劳动，有时我插不上手，就拿起芭蕉扇，给同志们扇，轮到我搬货时，他们也给我扇。这小小的一把扇子，虽然降低不了高温，但是我们的心里都感到格外的舒畅。这不是一般的凉风，这是劳动人民感情的交流，是阶级兄弟之间互相爱护，互相关怀之风。它有助于我们克服官僚主义，保持劳动人民的本色。
    我出身在一个贫农家庭，十三岁就给资本家当童工，一九四五年参军。以后虽然当了干部，但一直和战士生活在一起。行军时给战士背枪，宿营时给战士打洗脚水，这样使我向劳动人民，向普通的战士，学到了不少东西，一直保持了革命战士的本色。入城以后，由战争环境转变为和平环境，自己的职务也提升了，薪水也多了，生活过得越来越好。在中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的修正主义思想的影响下，十多年来，渐渐脱离了劳动群众。这样就使我减少了向劳动人民学习的机会，对劳动人民的阶级感情也逐渐疏远了。这是多么危险的事情啊！伟大的无产阶级文化大革命触及了我的灵魂，使我又回到了普通战士中间，能经常跟他们一起劳动，这真是我重新向他们学习的极好机会。我决心不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的殷切期望和关怀，在劳动中好好学习毛泽东思想，永远保持无产阶级朝气勃勃的革命青春。
