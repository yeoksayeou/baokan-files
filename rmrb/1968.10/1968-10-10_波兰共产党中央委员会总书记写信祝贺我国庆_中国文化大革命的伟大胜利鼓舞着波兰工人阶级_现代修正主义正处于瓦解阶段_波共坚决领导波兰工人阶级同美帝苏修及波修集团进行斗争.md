	New China News Agency, October 9th: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China received a letter from Kazimierz Mijak, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, congratulating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The full text of the congratulatory letter is as follows:

	Beijing
	Chairman Mao Zedong
	Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

	Dear Chairman Comrade,

	On the occasion of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, on behalf of the Party and the Polish working class and all laboring people, extends the most sincere greetings and congratulations to you, dear Chairman Comrade, to the Chinese people, and to the Communist Party of China.

	After two years of ideological and political struggle, the establishment of the revolutionary committees has world-historical significance. This is the result of the revolutionary struggle and tenacious work of 700 million people, and it is the indestructible victory of Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary thought during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This victory has strengthened the economic and defensive power of China, the bulwark of the world revolution.

	Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the heroic working class, the great Chinese people have achieved new historic victories in the past year: industrial and agricultural production has further increased; there have been brilliant developments and progress in science, technology, and culture; and the socialist construction of China has been comprehensively developed and strengthened.

	The long, arduous, and uncompromising struggle against the defenders of bourgeois ideology and the supporters of capitalist development in China has achieved complete victory on all fronts of struggle. With the exception of Taiwan Island, which is occupied by American imperialism, revolutionary committees have been established throughout China, successfully completing a historical stage of the cultural revolution. This victory has prevented the danger of the restoration of capitalism by Khrushchev revisionism in China and has strengthened the state and the people's defense against it. The brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led personally by Comrade Mao Zedong, are the solid victories of the dictatorship of the proletariat of 700 million people, and they are new victories in the revolutionary application of Marxism-Leninism in practice. They have strengthened the international forces of the proletariat and the peoples of colonial and dependent countries who are struggling for their national and social liberation.

	The invasion of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic by the traitorous clique of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, including Poland, is a counter-revolutionary and violent violation of the laws and principles of independent and autonomous international relations that guarantee each nation the right to determine its own destiny. This savage invasion has torn off the masks of the communist traitors, exposing their traitorous faces to the whole world. They preach socialism and proletarian internationalism with their mouths, but in action, they are nationalists and great-power chauvinists. They sign friendship treaties on paper, but in daily life, they use fascist terror and blackmail. The law of force and the big stick are the highest laws for these communist traitors.

	The unprecedented surrender of the Dubcek revisionist clique to the threat of force from the five invading countries and their betrayal of the interests of the working class and the people of Czechoslovakia have exposed to the whole world proletariat: the countries ruled by modern revisionists are in an irreversible counter-revolutionary state of disintegration. Their intensifying bourgeois contradictions cannot be concealed or eliminated through secret compromises, and the usual fascist iron-fist rule is in effect.

	The Polish United Workers' Party condemns the gangster-like invasion of the Brotherly Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia by the Gomulka clique, which is contrary to and hostile to the Polish working class. Under the orders of the Soviet traitors, the Gomulka clique participated in the invasion of Czechoslovakia, bringing shame to our country and people, a shame that can only be washed away by the Polish working class. Only by overthrowing the Gomulka revisionist clique through revolutionary struggle and establishing proletarian dictatorship in Poland can this shame be washed away, and only then can a fraternal revolutionary friendship be established between the Polish people and the people of Czechoslovakia.

	The Warsaw Pact has become a tool for the Khrushchev revisionists to threaten and blackmail the member countries of the Warsaw Pact. The withdrawal of the People's Republic of Albania from the Warsaw Pact has finally shattered the lie about the defensive nature of the Warsaw Pact and fully exposed its aggressive and counter-revolutionary nature. Everyone knows that the Warsaw Pact, manipulated by the Soviet revisionists, serves their great-power interests in cooperation with American imperialism and the domination of the world, and at the same time, it is to strengthen the rule of the Gomulka clique in Poland, which slavishly serves the traitors of the Kremlin.

	The Polish United Workers' Party leads the struggle of the Polish working class. It will never agree to subordinate the revolutionary interests of the Polish proletariat and socialism to the national interests of the Soviet great-power clique. The urgent and constant task of our Party is to fight against American imperialism and modern revisionism in Moscow and Warsaw.

	The great achievements of the Chinese people, especially the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong in the past two years, are an inspiration to us Polish revolutionaries and the Polish working class, and they are a beacon guiding the struggle for the revolution and victory of socialism in Poland.

	Long live the People's Republic of China!
	Long live the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!
	Long live the world front against American imperialism and modern revisionism!
	Long live the unity of the international Marxist-Leninist revolutionary movement that is on the rise!
	Long live and strengthen the fraternal friendship between the Polish people and the Chinese people!
	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Kazimierz Mijak
	General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party
	September 22, 1968

    波兰共产党中央委员会总书记写信祝贺我国庆
    中国文化大革命的伟大胜利鼓舞着波兰工人阶级
    现代修正主义正处于瓦解阶段　波共坚决领导波兰工人阶级同美帝苏修及波修集团进行斗争
    新华社九日讯  中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志，收到了波兰共产党中央委员会总书记卡齐米尔·米雅尔写来的祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年的信件。贺信全文如下：北京中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志：
    值此中华人民共和国成立十九周年之际，波兰共产党中央委员会代表党和波兰工人阶级以及全体劳动人民，向您——亲爱的主席同志，向中国人民和中国共产党，致以最衷心的问候和祝贺。
    在经历了两年的思想上和政治上的斗争以后，革命委员会的成立，具有世界性的历史意义，这是七亿人民革命斗争和顽强工作的结果，是毛泽东主席的革命思想在无产阶级文化大革命时期不可摧毁的胜利，这个胜利加强了世界革命的中流砥柱——中国的经济力量和防御力量。
    伟大的中国人民在英雄的工人阶级及其先锋队——以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，在最近一年中取得了新的历史性的胜利：工农业生产进一步增长；在科学、技术和文化方面有了辉煌的发展和进步；中国的社会主义建设得到了全面的发展和加强。
    同资产阶级思想的保护者和中国资本主义发展的支持者的长期的、艰巨的和不妥协的斗争，已在各条斗争战线上取得了完全的胜利。除了被美帝国主义霸占的台湾岛外，在全中国各地成立革命委员会，胜利地完成了文化革命中的一个历史阶段，这个胜利使国家和人民防止了赫鲁晓夫修正主义和在中国复辟资本主义的危险。在毛泽东同志亲自领导下的无产阶级文化大革命的这一辉煌成就，是七亿人民无产阶级专政的牢固胜利，是在实践中革命地运用马克思列宁主义学说的新胜利，它加强了正在争取自己的民族和社会解放的无产阶级和殖民地及附属国人民的国际力量。
    苏联叛徒集团及其卫星国，其中也有波兰，对捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国的侵略，是对保证每个民族都有决定自己命运的权利的独立自主的国际关系的法律和原则的反革命的和粗暴的破坏。这种野蛮的侵略撕破了共产主义叛徒们的假面具，在全世界面前暴露了他们的叛徒嘴脸。他们在口头上挂着社会主义和无产阶级国际主义，而在行动上却是民族主义者和大国沙文主义者。他们在纸上签订了友好条约，而在日常的生活中却采用法西斯恐怖和讹诈手段。武力法则、大棒法则，对这些共产主义叛徒们来说是最高的法则。
    杜布切克修正主义集团在来自五国侵略者的武力威胁面前的前所未有的投降和对工人阶级以及捷克斯洛伐克人民利益的背叛，向全世界无产阶级暴露出：现代修正主义者统治下的各国正处于无法挽回的反革命的瓦解阶段，他们之间日益加剧的资产阶级矛盾既无法掩饰，也无法通过秘密妥协的途径消除，通常的法西斯铁拳法则在起作用。
    波兰共产党谴责哥穆尔卡集团对兄弟国家和捷克斯洛伐克人民所进行的与波兰工人阶级格格不入的和相敌对的匪徒式的侵犯。哥穆尔卡集团在苏联叛徒的指使下，参与对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，使我们国家和人民蒙受耻辱，这种耻辱只有波兰工人阶级才能洗清。只有通过革命斗争的道路推翻哥穆尔卡修正主义集团和在波兰建立无产阶级专政，才能洗清这种耻辱，才能在波兰人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民之间建立起兄弟的革命友谊。
    华沙条约已成为赫鲁晓夫修正主义者手中对华沙条约成员国进行恐吓和讹诈的工具。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国退出华沙条约，最终地粉碎了关于华沙条约防御性的谎言，并充分地揭露了它的侵略性和反革命性。每个人都很清楚，被苏联修正主义者操纵的华沙条约，是为他们同美帝国主义合作和主宰世界的大国利益服务的，同时也是为了加强奴颜卑膝地为克里姆林宫的叛徒们效劳的哥穆尔卡集团在波兰的统治。
    波兰共产党领导着波兰工人阶级的斗争，她决不同意使波兰无产阶级和社会主义的革命利益从属于苏联大国主义集团的民族主义利益。同美帝国主义和莫斯科及华沙的现代修正主义进行斗争，是我们党的迫切的和经常的任务。
    中国人民的伟大成就，特别是由杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命最近两年来的伟大成就，是对我们波兰革命者和波兰工人阶级的鼓舞，是为波兰的革命和社会主义的胜利而斗争的指路明灯。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党万岁！
    同美帝国主义和现代修正主义作斗争的世界阵线万岁！
    正在复兴的国际马克思列宁主义革命运动的团结万岁！
    波兰人民和中国人民的兄弟友谊万岁并不断加强！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    波兰共产党中央委员会总书记卡齐米尔·米雅尔
                        一九六八年九月二十二日
