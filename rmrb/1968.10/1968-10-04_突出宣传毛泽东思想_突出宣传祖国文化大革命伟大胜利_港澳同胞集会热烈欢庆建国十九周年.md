Hong Kong and Macao compatriots held grand celebrations on October 1st to mark the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Early on October 1st, the streets of Hong Kong and Macao were adorned with fluttering five-star red flags and the resonant melody of "The East is Red." Buildings housing various patriotic unions, social organizations, schools, institutions, and shops in these two cities were festively decorated.

On the morning of October 1st, 2,000 representatives from various sectors in Hong Kong held a grand celebration. The chairman of the meeting, Yang Guang, President of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, and Liang Weilin, Director of the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency, along with representatives from the peasant, student, cultural, and business communities, delivered speeches. The representatives stated: Over the past two years, our great socialist motherland has achieved tremendous successes in all aspects, which is a testament to the brilliant leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The complete victory of the Cultural Revolution is not far off. They said: The current situation in Hong Kong's struggle against British imperialism and violence is excellent. Over the past year, Mao Zedong Thought has spread widely in Hong Kong, and the movement to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought has become an unstoppable mass movement. The British authorities' attempt to deprive Hong Kong compatriots of this sacred right has completely failed. In the future, Hong Kong compatriots should further raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought more deeply and extensively, continue to mobilize the masses, expand the anti-imperialist patriotic united front, and, with the support of the people of the motherland, carry the struggle against British imperialism and violence to the end. They will also join the people of the motherland and revolutionary people around the world to carry out the struggle against imperialism and revisionism to the end.

The meeting, amidst thunderous applause and cheers, passed a resolution to send a message of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Patriotic compatriots illegally imprisoned by the British authorities in Stanley Prison held a tea party on September 30th to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, breaking through the enemy's numerous restrictions. The anti-British and anti-violence fighters, together with the people of the entire country and all patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, sincerely wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! They resolutely declared that to defend the sacred right of Hong Kong compatriots to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, they will continue the struggle in prison until the final victory.

The number of units and individuals participating in the National Day activities in Hong Kong this year, as well as the scale and scope of the celebrations, are unprecedented. The celebrations began on September 16th and will last for 24 days. During the celebrations, Hong Kong compatriots will prominently propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the great victories of the Cultural Revolution in the motherland. From late August to the eve of National Day, more than 150,000 people visited the China Machinery and Instrument Exhibition, which reflects the great achievements of the motherland in the industrial sector during the Cultural Revolution. During the National Day period, Hong Kong compatriots also held revolutionary art performances, exhibitions of socialist revolution and construction in the motherland, and various forms of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda meetings, reports, and sharing sessions.

More than 1,000 patriotic compatriots from various sectors in Macao held a grand celebration on the morning of October 1st. The meeting, amidst enthusiastic applause, passed a resolution to send a message of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao. On the same day, patriotic compatriots from 28 units held separate celebration activities. In the evening, fireworks were set off in Nam Van, and dozens of cultural and artistic troupes performed revolutionary art programs at five locations simultaneously for the compatriots of Macao.
