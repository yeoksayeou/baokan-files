Editor's Note: Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The education system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command"; "We should select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, let them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice."

In recent years, the Navy's advanced collective unit in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought—the Party Committee of the 441st Unit—has followed Chairman Mao's consistent instructions, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and educational line, inherited and carried forward the glorious traditions of our Party and our army, and in the sharp struggle against the bourgeois reactionary military line, established a new type of "thatched university."

This "thatched university" insists on selecting students from soldiers with practical experience, with good political and ideological conditions as the primary criterion for selecting students; it insists on highlighting proletarian politics, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, and taking class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the main course; it insists on implementing the teaching policy of "less but better" and the mass line teaching method, mobilizing the masses, breaking through the revisionist "rules" and "frames," and achieving a series of major reforms in training. From this "thatched university," a batch of red and expert military technical cadres have been trained quickly, economically, and effectively, many of whom have become outstanding modern torpedo boat commanders.

This "thatched university" has demonstrated the great power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and educational line with its outstanding work achievements, proving the unparalleled wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on educational revolution! This article talks about training military technical cadres, but its basic experience has universal significance. At a time when the entire military and people of the country are following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, actively participating in the great tide of educational revolution, and launching a fierce attack on all bourgeois and revisionist educational systems, policies, and methods, we publish this report, hoping it can inspire and help readers.

The Birth of the "Thatched University"

In a certain naval base in southern China, there is a new type of "university" established according to the traditions of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University to train torpedo boat commanders.

Here, there are no "complete" teaching facilities and training venues, no "scholarly" full-time teachers, and not even a "decent" school building. The students climb mountains and cross rivers, cut grass, chop bamboo, and build neat and bright thatched huts as their dormitories and classrooms; they lift their bedding and lay down boards as their desks for naval chart work; the officers and soldiers from the fleet with rich practical experience are their teachers; the vast and surging sea is their best training ground...

This is the Navy's advanced collective unit in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought—the 441st Unit's torpedo boat commander training team, known as the "thatched university."

Since 1963, batches of naval soldiers with practical experience have been selected and sent here. After a few months of study, they return to their units to serve as torpedo boat commanders. Most of them have passed the test of storms and waves and become outstanding boat commanders. In recent years, this "thatched university" has quickly, economically, and effectively trained a large number of red and expert military technical cadres, who have become the mainstay of this unit in completing combat, preparedness, and various tasks.

The birth of this "thatched university" is the result of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and educational line defeating the bourgeois reactionary military line and educational line.

With the development and growth of the people's navy, the demand for torpedo boat commanders in the units is increasing. However, relying on "regular" academies for training, both in quantity and quality, is far from meeting the needs of the units. What should we do? Can we rely on the units to train themselves?

Some people think: Torpedo boat commanders need to master very complex technology, and it is not possible without several years of "regular" academy training. The boat commanders trained by the units themselves lack a "systematic and comprehensive" theoretical foundation, and it is very difficult to develop.

The unit's Party Committee disagrees with this view. They believe: Relying on the units to train cadres is a good tradition that our army has practiced for many years. Chairman Mao taught us long ago: "Learn war from war—this is our main method." As early as the Jianxi-Shaanxi period, Chairman Mao personally established a training team for commanders and instructed that it should be held regularly. Although the technology of torpedo boats is relatively complex, it is not mysterious. The units have a large number of officers and soldiers with very rich practical experience and the superior conditions for teaching in connection with reality. As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's instructions on the principle of combining theory with practice, resolutely implement the teaching policy of "less but better" proposed by Vice Chairman Lin, fully mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses, we can definitely train modern boat commanders who meet the needs of the units in this "thatched university."

In fact, this unit has previously selected outstanding soldiers to hold two sessions of boat captain training classes, and each battalion has also trained boat captains on the job using the method of "old leading new." The results were very good. It was just that the interference and sabotage of the bourgeois reactionary military line prevented it from being continued. The facts have proven: We can definitely train very outstanding boat commanders ourselves, and boat captain Yang Hanwen is a prominent example.

Not long ago, on a pitch-black night, Yang Hanwen, who had just taken over as boat captain, encountered bad weather on his way back from a mission. Suddenly, the rudder rope broke, and the rudder became ineffective. The boat was like a wild horse running amok, crashing from side to side. This place has narrow channels and many reefs, with the danger of hitting a reef at any time. Facing this emergency, Comrade Yang Hanwen remained very calm. He calmly used the left and right main engines to speed up and slow down, advancing and retreating, and in the situation where the boat rudder was ineffective, he skillfully maneuvered the boat around the shoals and reefs, through the narrow channel, and safely returned to the base.

Boat captain Yang Hanwen, who did not use the rudder to maneuver the boat back to the port, had not received any "regular" training. He was trained by the boat captain training class of this unit. Although he did not have a "systematic and comprehensive" theoretical foundation, he was armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, had unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, and had rich practical experience. He could skillfully master modern military technology.

The fallacy that the unit cannot train modern military technical cadres was refuted by irrefutable facts. The bourgeois "technical mysticism" was exposed. A new type of "university" for training boat commanders was established in the sharp struggle between the two lines and two ideologies.

The Starting Point of a Century-Long Undertaking

The training team has been established. Who should be selected to study in the training team? This is a major issue concerning who will master modern military technology and what kind of successors our unit will cultivate. There was also a struggle around this issue.

Ma Guocheng, a signalman who has been rated as a model soldier every year, has good political and ideological conditions but a relatively low level of education. Can Ma Guocheng enter the training team? Some people shook their heads when they heard this. These people, influenced by the bourgeois reactionary military line, always overemphasize educational attainment when selecting students, even nitpicking about height, appearance, and other aspects, consciously or unconsciously pushing political and ideological conditions to a secondary position, deviating from Chairman Mao's proletarian military line.

This view was severely criticized by the unit's Party Committee. Comrades pointed out: Operating torpedo boats is a modern science and technology that requires a certain level of education; however, what is more important is a high level of proletarian consciousness. Even if some soldiers have a lower level of education, as long as their political and ideological conditions are good, the difficulties in learning technology can be completely overcome; if their political and ideological conditions are not good, even if their level of education is high, they will not be able to serve the proletariat, and they will run away when the battle comes. The Party Committee decided: The training team should select students based on Chairman Mao's five conditions for proletarian revolutionary successors; at the same time, it should follow the mass line and mobilize the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to discuss and evaluate the candidates for admission. The issue of cultivating successors is a century-long undertaking. Selecting good "seeds" is the starting point of a century-long undertaking and must be given full attention.

To investigate whether Comrade Ma Guocheng could enter the school, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee personally went to the battalion where Ma Guocheng was stationed to conduct a survey. The soldiers said: Comrade Ma Guocheng has a good background, high consciousness, deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, and a strong sense of responsibility for the construction of the people's navy; in the past few years in the unit, he has executed tasks bravely and actively, accumulating a relatively rich practical experience. Such a comrade, in order to implement Chairman Mao's instruction: "To oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must definitely build a powerful navy," no difficulty is too great, and no matter how complex the technology, he can master it. Based on the opinions of the masses, the Party Committee approved Comrade Ma Guocheng to study in the training team. Batch after batch of soldiers like Ma Guocheng, who have good political and ideological conditions and practical experience, were subsequently sent to the training team to study, providing organizational guarantees for the training team to cultivate red and expert boat commanders.

Soldiers with relatively low levels of education faced many difficulties when they first arrived at the training team. The Party Committee proposed: Not only should we open the door to these comrades organizationally, but also mentally: help them liberate their minds, boost their confidence, and establish the ambition to occupy the frontiers of modern military science and technology.

Living examples are the most convincing. Many old boat captains trained by the unit took the lead in speaking from their own experiences, inspiring the students with examples of how they actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, carried out ideological revolutionization, continuously improved proletarian consciousness, overcame all difficulties, and quickly mastered the tactics and techniques of boat operations. Deputy platoon leader Li Deqian, who had only junior high school education before enlisting and had not received "regular" academy training, was able to skillfully master the tactics of boat operations because he seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. When he was an electric navigation soldier, he created the "electric compass stabilizer" with the masses under the guidance of "On Practice," giving this modern scientific instrument a makeover and greatly shortening the time for the boat to prepare for navigation and combat. Later, after a short period of study in the boat captain training class, he became a boat commander. He led the masses to launch a fierce attack on the pedantic philosophy in torpedo attack tactics and finally found the rules in the thousands of data needed for torpedo attacks, creating the "torpedo attack mental arithmetic method," freeing boat commanders from the dizzying amount of data and greatly improving the level of combat technology.

Li Deqian's advanced deeds powerfully demonstrated: The military commanders trained from soldiers with practical experience are the most loyal to Chairman Mao and have the closest ties with the masses; they come from the front lines of practice and have the most sensory knowledge of ship equipment and life at sea. Once they master Mao Zedong Thought, they can create wisdom and talent and create miracles. They not only can quickly master modern military science and technology by closely combining theory with practice, but also can summarize practical experience and create genuine theory. "The only genuine theory in the world is the theory that is abstracted from objective reality and has been proven in objective reality," while the so-called "comprehensive and systematic" theory is actually the bourgeois theory that is detached from reality and is a big stick to prevent soldiers of worker-peasant origin from mastering modern military science and technology.

The students of the training team learned a lot from these old boat captains and were greatly inspired. Under the guidance and leadership of these good teachers, they overcame one obstacle after another with full confidence, tenaciously advancing towards the free kingdom of modern military science and technology, and their ideological and technical levels improved rapidly, with remarkable learning effects. They basically achieved the goal of training one and succeeding one. That signalman Ma Guocheng, who was once considered by some to be unable to enter school, has now become the captain of a "model" boat after a few months of study. This boat has been awarded the title of "four good" every year and has made new contributions in executing the tasks of guarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, preparedness, and combat.

Class Struggle is the Main Course

What should be the main course for the short-term training team for boat commanders? Some comrades said: "Boat commanders are supposed to learn how to operate the boat and launch torpedoes, so they should mainly learn military technology."

The unit's Party Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle being the main course for youth, clearly pointed out: The training team should take studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, improving the students' proletarian consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines, as the main course of teaching.

When the second session of specialized training in the training team was about to end, a vigorous socialist education movement was launched in the nearby rural areas. The Party Committee believed: This is a good opportunity to temper and improve oneself in the great waves of class struggle. The students of the training team should all go to the countryside to participate in the socialist education movement before they can graduate. At this time, this unit, in cooperation with a sister unit, fought a brilliant battle. Some cadres proposed: "Preparedness needs people, so they should graduate."

Should they graduate or not? The Party Committee believed: The essence of the problem is whether to highlight proletarian politics or military affairs. According to the needs of the current preparedness tasks, the boat team was not so short of people. The call to "graduate" was essentially seeing that the students' problems of operating the boat and launching torpedoes had been solved, wanting to end the study, and still not placing political and ideological issues in the first position, not fundamentally solving the problem of whether to rely on technology or politics in combat. The Party Committee decided: Mobilize the students and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the training team to seriously summarize the recent victory, improve their understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line from combat practice.

This was an outstanding example of using the great helmsman Mao Zedong's military thought to win a battle relying on proletarian politics: The boat captains trained by the unit themselves commanded the torpedo boats and launched a night attack with sister ships. When the enemy ships crazily fired at the torpedo boats, would they dare to charge? This was a severe test for the torpedo boat team! The soldiers and officers who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao did not hesitate for a moment. With the heroic spirit of daring to overwhelm all enemies and the iron-willed determination of "fighting to the death," they, like lightning and thunder, used the pitch-black night as cover, broke through the enemy's fire net, and like a sharp knife, stabbed towards the enemy ship. At a very close range, they accurately launched the torpedo, cooperating with the fierce firepower of the sister ships, instantly blowing the enemy ship to pieces, sinking it to the bottom of the sea.

Comrades summarized and analyzed this battle example, linking it with many battle examples of sister units, deeply feeling that: Vice Chairman Lin's teaching that "the greatest combat effectiveness is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought" is an unshakable great truth. Although torpedo boats are technologically complex, ultimately, the main feature of their combat mission is to act as "sea demolition experts": whether they can win or not depends on whether they dare to carry forward the fine traditions of close combat and night combat of our army, dare to brave the dense artillery fire of the enemy ships, and quickly and accurately send the torpedoes. For a boat commander, it is important to know how to operate the boat and launch torpedoes, but courage and fearlessness are even more important. Training and cultivating boat commanders must highlight proletarian politics, take class struggle as the main course, arm the mind with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, continuously improve proletarian consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and cultivate revolutionary heroism and the spirit of self-sacrifice.

The understanding was unified, and the training team actively organized the students to go to the great waves of class struggle for tempering, participating in the socialist education movement in the countryside, and participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to undertake the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, they immediately responded. The day after receiving the Party Committee's notice, they rushed to the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries."

In the great waves of class struggle, the students' proletarian consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines rapidly improved, and their class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deepened. Every new instruction from Chairman Mao, every battle order from the proletarian headquarters, they studied, followed, and used them urgently. Receiving orders at midnight, studying and implementing them at midnight; receiving instructions in the morning, organizing propaganda in the morning. They never detached themselves from proletarian politics, never detached themselves from the practice of revolutionary struggle.

The training team put political and ideological work in the first place, listed class struggle as the main course, and at the same time, used good political and ideological conditions to lead, promote, and advance other three goods. The students' level of ideological revolutionization was high, which strongly promoted the cultivation of the three-eight work style, accelerated the mastery of military technology, and greatly improved the level of life management, enabling the students to develop comprehensively and rapidly in all four aspects.

Continuous Revolution, Thorough Revolution

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sounded the bugle for launching a comprehensive attack on the bourgeois educational system and educational ideology. The torrents of revolutionary criticism opened up a new horizon for the training team to carry out continuous and thorough revolution!

At first, some comrades thought: The learning and living of the training team have not deviated from the unit; the students and teachers are all from the unit's practice; the past specialized teaching has already compressed the courses of military academies for several years into a few months; the boat commanders trained by the training team have proven to be reliable in combat practice and work practice. It seems that there is not much to do in the educational revolution in the training team.

Many comrades, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on continuous and thorough revolution, analyzed the specialized teaching of the training team in the past few years in a dialectical manner. They believed: The training team compressed the courses of "regular" academies for several years into a few months, training a large number of reliable military technical cadres, which is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, a major achievement in implementing Vice Chairman Lin's proposal of the "less but better" policy, and a big step forward in the reform of military training in the unit. However, this is only the first step of the long march. By seriously analyzing and summarizing the teaching practice of the training team, it can be found: Many specialized teachings have not completely started from the needs of actual combat; the unit's creations and experiences in combat and training have not been timely summarized and absorbed into teaching; the students' specialized learning is still far from Vice Chairman Lin's requirement of "grasping the essence and mastering it thoroughly." The educational revolution in the training team is not without prospects, but it is "full of potential."

Comrades cited a clear example: The characteristic of torpedo boats is "small but complete." A small boat has various specialties. According to the past "foreign framework," boat commanders must learn all these specialties from theory to practical operation. In this way, the content of the boat commander's specialized learning is very cumbersome, making it difficult to highlight the key points and implement the "less but better" policy. However, a battalion, when training boat commanders, boldly broke through the "foreign framework." Based on many years of practical experience, they believed that boat commanders only needed to understand the general use of many specialties on the boat and did not need to include them in the specialized learning plan. They took the students to the boat, mobilized the students to teach each other, with those who had served as engine soldiers explaining the engine, and those who had served as signalmen explaining signals, explaining and practicing with real objects, quickly solving the problem. In this way, they could highlight the key points, grasp the essence, and concentrate the specialized teaching on the most needed combat courses such as operating the boat and torpedo attacks, ensuring that these most needed courses are mastered thoroughly.

This incident gave people a great inspiration: Why was this problem not recognized and solved in the past? Ultimately, it was due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary military line in one's mind, and the so-called "complete" and "systematic" set of frameworks had not been thoroughly broken. Comrades deeply felt: To truly reform training according to Mao Zedong Thought, further implement the principle of combining theory with practice and the "less but better" policy, one must continuously struggle against the influence of the bourgeois reactionary military line in one's mind and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary military line and educational line. Therefore, they combined revolutionary criticism, seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution and Vice Chairman Lin's related teachings, further summarized and studied the unit's combat practice, and after repeated revisions, finally formulated a brand-new specialized teaching plan. This plan highlighted the use of Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide specialized teaching, implemented the spirit of highlighting key points, emphasizing practice, grasping the essence, and mastering it thoroughly, and reduced the specialized courses and specialized teaching time by two-thirds.

This plan was praised by the unit's Party Committee and the broad masses of commanders and was also tested by practice. In the past two years, many soldiers who had just boarded the boat were sent to the training team to study. Due to the implementation of the "less but better" policy in training, starting from the needs of actual combat, and attaching great importance to practice, they could also master the most needed combat skills in a very short time.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed: "Universities should still be established. I am mainly talking about engineering universities, but the education system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command, following the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice." The Party Committee of this unit and the comrades of the training team studied this instruction from Chairman Mao, reviewed the path of training boat commanders from soldiers with practical experience in recent years, and deeply felt that Chairman Mao's instruction was extremely great, extremely wise, and extremely correct. They decided, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to mobilize the broad masses, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary military line and educational line, and further carry out training reforms in an organized and step-by-step manner, truly turning this "thatched university" into a Mao Zedong Thought university, making greater contributions to the construction of the people's navy!

    “抗大”的传统，光荣的道路——海军四四
    一一部队党委是怎样从实践中培养鱼雷快艇指挥员的
    编者按：毛主席最近教导我们：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅”；“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”
    几年来，海军活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体——四四一一部队党委遵照毛主席的一贯教导，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和教育路线，继承和发扬了我党我军的光荣传统，在同资产阶级反动军事路线的尖锐斗争中，兴办起一所新型的“草篷大学”。
    这所“草篷大学”，坚持从有实践经验的战士中选拔学员，以政治思想好作为选拔学员的首要条件；坚持突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛泽东思想，以阶级斗争和两条路线斗争为主课；坚持贯彻“少而精”的教学方针和群众路线的教学方法，发动群众，打破修正主义的“条条”、“框框”，在训练上实现了一系列的重大改革。从这所“草篷大学”里，多快好省地培养出一批批又红又专的军事技术干部，其中很多人成了优秀的现代化鱼雷快艇的指挥员。
    这所“草篷大学”，以自己出色的工作成绩，充分显示了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和教育路线的强大威力，证明了毛主席关于教育革命的一系列最新指示的无比英明，无比正确！这里讲的是培养军事技术干部，但是，它的基本经验却有普遍意义。在全国军民遵照毛主席最新指示，积极投入教育革命的伟大洪流，向着一切资产阶级、修正主义的教育制度、教育方针和方法猛烈冲击的时候，我们发表这篇报道，希望能对读者有所启发和帮助。
    “草篷大学”的诞生
    在祖国南方某海军基地，有一所按照“抗大”的传统办起来的培养鱼雷快艇指挥员的新型“大学”。
    这里，没有“完善”的教学设备和训练场所，没有“学问高深”的专职教员，甚至连个“象样”的校舍都没有。学员们爬山越岭，刈茅草，砍竹子，搭起了一座座整齐敞亮的草篷，就是他们的宿舍兼教室；掀起被褥，铺板就是他们进行海图作业的桌子；舰艇部队里富有实践经验的干部和战士，就是他们的教员；汹涌澎湃的大海，就是他们最好的教练场所……
    这就是被人们叫做“草篷大学”的海军活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体——四四一一部队鱼雷快艇指挥员教导队。
    从一九六三年以来，一批批有实践经验的海军战士被选送到这里，经过短短几个月的学习，又回到部队中去，担任鱼雷快艇的指挥干部。他们当中，绝大多数经受了狂风恶浪的考验，成为优秀的快艇指挥员。几年来，从这所“草篷大学”里，多快好省地培养出一大批又红又专的军事技术干部，成为这个部队完成战斗、战备和各项任务的主要骨干力量。
    这所“草篷大学”的诞生，是毛主席的无产阶级军事路线和教育路线战胜资产阶级反动军事路线和教育路线的结果。
    随着人民海军的发展壮大，部队对鱼雷快艇指挥干部的需要越来越大。而依靠“正规”院校培养，无论在数量上和质量上，都远远不能满足部队的要求。怎么办？能不能依靠部队自己培养？
    有的人认为：鱼雷快艇指挥员需要掌握十分复杂的技术，不经过若干年“正规”院校的训练是不行的。部队自己培养的快艇干部，缺乏“系统全面”的理论基础，发展是很困难的。
    部队党委不同意这种看法。他们认为：依靠部队自己培养干部，这是我军多年来行之有效的优良传统。毛主席很早就教导我们：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”早在井冈山斗争时期，毛主席就亲自创办了训练指挥员的教导队，并且指示要经常办下去。鱼雷快艇的技术虽然比较复杂，但并不神秘。部队里有大批实践经验十分丰富的干部和战士，有联系实际进行教学的优越条件。只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵照毛主席指示的理论联系实际的原则，坚决贯彻林副主席提出的“少而精”的教学方针，充分发动群众，依靠群众，“草篷大学”里完全能够培养出适合部队要求的现代化快艇指挥员。
    实际上，这个部队过去曾经选拔优秀的战士办过两期艇长训练班，各个大队也在工作岗位上采取以老带新的方式，培养过快艇艇长，效果都很好。只是由于资产阶级反动军事路线的干扰和破坏，没有能够坚持下去。事实证明：自己完全可以培养出十分出色的快艇指挥员，艇长杨汉文就是一个突出的例子。
    不久以前，一个漆黑的夜晚，刚担任艇长不久的杨汉文，在一次执行任务后的返航途中，遇到恶劣气象，突然，舵索崩断，舵失灵了，快艇就象脱了缰的野马，东奔西撞。这地方，航道窄，礁石多，随时都有触礁的危险。面对着这紧急的情况，杨汉文同志十分镇定。他沉着地利用左右两部主机加速减速，进伡退伡，在艇舵失灵的情况下，驾驶着快艇绕过浅滩暗礁，穿过狭窄航道，安全地开回基地。
    不用艇舵把快艇操纵回港的艇长杨汉文，并没有受过什么“正规”训练，他就是这个部队的艇长训练班培养出来的。他虽然没有什么“系统全面”的理论基础，但是，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装，有革命战士对毛主席的无限忠心，有丰富的实践经验，他就能够出色地掌握现代化的军事技术。
    部队不能培养现代化军事技术干部的谬论，在雄辩的事实面前被驳倒了。资产阶级的“技术神秘”论破了产。一所培养快艇指挥员的新型“大学”，在两条路线、两种思想的尖锐斗争中兴办起来。
    百年大计的起点
    教导队办起来了。选拔什么人进教导队学习？这是关系到现代军事技术掌握在什么人手里，关系到我们的部队培养什么样的接班人的大问题。围绕着这个问题，也有一场斗争。
    年年被评为五好战士的信号兵马国成，政治思想条件很好，但是文化水平比较低。马国成能不能进教导队？有的人一听就连连摇头。这些人受到资产阶级反动军事路线的影响，选拔学员的时候，总是过分强调文化程度，甚至在个头、长相等等方面吹毛求疵，自觉不自觉地把政治思想条件挤到次要位置，背离了毛主席的无产阶级建军路线。
    这种观点受到部队党委的严肃批评。同志们指出：操纵鱼雷快艇，是一门现代科学技术，需要有一定的文化知识；但是，更需要的是高度的无产阶级觉悟。有的战士文化水平即使低一些，只要政治思想好，学习技术的困难就完全可以克服；如果政治思想不好，文化水平再高，掌握了技术也不可能为无产阶级服务，打起仗来还会往后跑。党委决定：教导队选拔学员，必须坚持以毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件为标准；同时，走群众路线，发动广大指战员评议入学对象。培养接班人的问题是百年大计，选好“苗子”，就是百年大计的起点，一定要充分重视。
    为了考察马国成同志能不能入学，党委副书记亲自到马国成所在的大队，进行调查研究。战士们说：马国成同志出身好，觉悟高，对伟大领袖毛主席有深厚的阶级感情，对人民海军的建设有强烈的事业心；他在部队几年，执行任务勇敢积极，积累了比较丰富的实践经验。象这样的同志，为了贯彻执行毛主席的指示：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”再大的困难也挡不住他，再复杂的技术，他也能掌握起来。根据群众的意见，党委批准马国成同志进教导队学习。一批批象马国成这样政治思想好、有实践经验的战士，先后被选送到教导队学习来了，这就为教导队培养又红又专的快艇指挥干部，提供了组织上的保证。
    文化水平比较低的战士刚到教导队，学习上的困难的确是很多的。党委提出：不仅要从组织上给这些同志“敞开大门”，还要从思想上给他们“敞开大门”：帮助他们解放思想，提高信心，树立占领现代军事科学技术阵地的雄心壮志。
    活的榜样最有说服力。一些部队自己培养的老艇长，纷纷现身说法，以自己活学活用毛泽东思想，大搞思想革命化，不断提高无产阶级觉悟，排除万难，迅速掌握快艇作战的战术技术的实例启发学员。副中队长李德宪，入伍前只有初中程度，也没有经过“正规”院校学习，但是，由于他认真活学活用毛主席著作，他就不仅能把快艇作战的本领熟练地掌握起来，而且能把毛主席的哲学思想，创造性地运用到军事科学技术中去。还在他当电航兵的时候，他就在《实践论》的指引下，同群众一起，创造了“电罗经稳定加速器”，给这具现代科学仪器革了一次命，大大缩短了快艇备航备战的时间。以后，经过艇长训练班的短期学习，当了快艇指挥员，他又带领群众，向鱼雷攻击战术技术中的烦琐哲学猛烈冲击，终于在鱼雷攻击时需要计算的千百个数据里，摸索出规律，创造了“鱼雷攻击心算法”，使快艇指挥员从令人头昏目眩的大量数据中解放出来，作战技术水平大大提高。
    李德宪的先进事迹，有力地说明：从有实践经验的战士中培养出来的军事指挥员，他们对毛主席最忠诚，和群众的联系最密切；他们来自实践第一线，对舰艇技术装备以及海上生活，最有感性知识，他们一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就能出智慧，出才干，就能创造人间奇迹。他们不但能把理论和实际最紧密地结合起来，迅速地掌握现代军事科学技术，而且能把实践经验总结起来，创造真正的理论。“真正的理论在世界上只有一种，就是从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论”，那种所谓“全面系统”的理论，实际上是资产阶级的脱离实际的空洞的理论，是排斥工农出身的战士掌握现代军事科学技术的大棒。
    教导队的学员们，从这些老艇长的身上，学到了许多东西，也受到很大鼓舞。在这些好教员的帮助和带领下，他们满怀信心地克服了一个又一个障碍，顽强地向着现代军事科学技术的自由王国进军，思想、技术水平迅速提高，学习效果十分显著。基本上做到了培养一个，成功一个。那个曾经被有些人认为不能入学的信号兵马国成，经过短短的几个月学习，现在已经成为一艘“标兵”艇的艇长。这艘艇年年获得四好称号，在执行保卫无产阶级文化大革命的战备、战斗任务中，不断做出新的贡献。
    阶级斗争是主课
    培养快艇指挥员的短期教导队，应该以什么为主课？有的同志说：“快艇指挥员就是要学会开艇、放雷，应该主要学军事技术。”
    部队党委遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于阶级斗争是青年的一门主课的教导，毫不含糊地指出：教导队应该把活学活用毛泽东思想，提高学员的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，作为教学的主课。
    在教导队第二期专业学习快要结束的时候，驻地附近农村开展了轰轰烈烈的社会主义教育运动。党委认为：这是一个在阶级斗争的大风浪里锻炼提高的大好机会。教导队的学员应该都到农村去参加一段社会主义教育运动，才能算毕业。正在这时候，这个部队协同兄弟部队打了一个漂亮仗，有的干部就提出：“战备等人用，应该毕业了。”
    毕业还是不毕业？党委认为：问题的实质，是一个突出无产阶级政治还是突出军事的问题。根据当时战备任务的需要，艇队并不那么缺人，叫喊“该毕业了”，实质上是只看到学员开艇、放雷的技术问题解决了，就想结束学习，思想深处仍然没有把政治思想放在第一位，没有从根本上解决打仗主要靠技术，还是靠政治的问题。党委决定：发动教导队的学员和广大干部战士，认真总结最近的一次胜仗，从战斗实践中提高对毛主席无产阶级军事路线的认识。
    这是一次运用伟大统帅毛主席的军事思想，靠无产阶级政治打胜仗的出色战例：部队自己培养出来的艇长指挥着鱼雷快艇，协同兄弟舰艇深夜出击。当敌舰向快艇疯狂射击的时候，敢不敢冲上去？这是对鱼雷快艇队的严峻考验！无限忠于毛主席的指战员们，没有半点犹豫。他们以敢于压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，以“刺刀见红”的钢铁决心，疾如迅雷，快如闪电，利用漆黑的夜色作掩护，突破敌人的火网，象一把锋利的尖刀插向敌舰，在极近的距离上，准确地发射了鱼雷，配合兄弟舰艇的猛烈火力，当场把敌舰打得粉身碎骨，葬身海底。
    同志们总结和分析了这一战例，联系兄弟部队的许多战例，深深体会到：林副主席教导的“最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人”，是一个颠扑不破的伟大真理。鱼雷快艇虽然技术复杂，但是，归根结底，执行“海上爆破手”的任务是它作战的主要特点：能不能取得胜利，关键就在于敢不敢发扬我军近战、夜战的优良传统，敢不敢冒着敌舰的密集炮火，迅速而准确地把鱼雷送上去。对一个快艇指挥员来说，会开艇，会放雷固然重要，勇敢、不怕死尤其重要。训练和培养快艇指挥员，必须突出无产阶级政治，以阶级斗争为主课，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装头脑，不断提高无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，培养革命的英雄主义和自我牺牲精神。
    认识统一了，教导队就积极组织学员到阶级斗争的大风浪中去锻炼，参加农村社会主义教育运动，参加无产阶级文化大革命运动。伟大领袖毛主席发出人民解放军要担负“三支”“两军”任务的伟大号召，他们立即响应。在接到党委通知后的第二天，就奔赴“三支”“两军”第一线。
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，学员们的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟迅速提高，对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的阶级感情不断加深。毛主席的每一个最新指示，无产阶级司令部每一个战斗号令，他们都做到了急学，紧跟，狠用。半夜接到号令，半夜研究贯彻；清晨收到指示，清晨组织宣传。一刻也不脱离无产阶级政治，一刻也不脱离革命斗争的实践。
    教导队把政治思想工作摆在第一位，把阶级斗争列为主课，同时又用政治思想好统帅、带动和促进其他三好。学员思想革命化程度高了，有力地促进了三八作风的培养，加速了对军事技术的掌握，生活管理的水平也有了很大提高，使学员在四个方面都得到全面迅速的发展。
    不断革命，彻底革命
    无产阶级文化大革命，吹响了向资产阶级教育制度和教育思想发动全面攻击的进军号。革命大批判的洪流，为教导队打开了不断革命、彻底革命的新天地！
      起先，有的同志觉得：教导队的学习和生活都没有脱离部队；学员和教员都是从部队实践中来的；过去的专业教学，已经把军事院校几年的课程压缩成几个月；教导队培养的快艇艇长，在战斗实践和工作实践中证明是过得硬的。看来，教育革命在教导队似乎没有多大搞头了。
    许多同志根据毛主席不断革命、彻底革命的教导，对教导队这几年的专业教学，作了一分为二的分析。他们认为：教导队把“正规”院校几年的课程压缩到几个月，培养出大批过硬的军事技术干部，这是毛主席无产阶级建军路线的重大胜利，是贯彻执行林副主席提出的“少而精”方针的重大成绩，是在部队军事训练改革上迈出了一大步。但是，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。认真分析和总结一下教导队的教学实践，就可以发现：有不少专业教学，还没有完全从实战需要出发；部队在作战和训练中的一些创造和经验，也没有及时总结，吸收到教学中来；学员的专业学习，离林副主席提出的“抓住精华，学得精通”的要求，还有相当大的距离。教导队的教育革命，不是没有搞头，而是“大有可为”。
    同志们举出了一个明显的事例：鱼雷快艇的特点是“麻雀虽小，五脏俱全”。一艘小小的艇只，有五花八门的专业。按照过去的“洋框框”，快艇指挥员必须由理论知识到实际操作，统统学会这些专业。这样，艇长的专业学习内容就十分庞杂，就很难突出重点，贯彻“少而精”的方针。但是，有一个大队在自己训练艇长的时候，大胆地冲破了“洋框框”，他们根据多年的实践经验，认为快艇上的许多专业，艇长只需要懂得一般使用就行了，根本不需要列入专业学习计划。他们把学员带到艇上，发动学员互教互学，当过轮机兵的讲轮机，当过电讯兵的讲电讯，对着实物，边讲边练，很快就解决了问题。这样，就能够突出重点，抓住精华，把专业教学集中到操纵快艇和鱼雷攻击等实战最需要的课目上，保证这些最需要的课目学得精通。
    这件事情给人们的启发很大：为什么这个问题过去没有认识、没有解决呢？归根结底，是由于头脑里还有资产阶级反动军事路线的影响，所谓“完整”、“系统”的一套框框还没有彻底打破。同志们深深感到：要真正按照毛泽东思想改革训练，进一步贯彻理论联系实际的原则和“少而精”的方针，就要不断和自己头脑里的资产阶级反动军事路线的影响作斗争，彻底清除资产阶级反动军事路线和教育路线的流毒。于是，他们结合着革命大批判，认真学习了毛主席有关教育革命的指示和林副主席的有关教导，进一步总结和研究了部队的战斗实践，经过一次又一次的修改，终于制定出一个崭新的专业教学计划。这个计划突出了以毛主席著作为基本教材，用毛泽东思想统帅专业教学，贯彻了突出重点，着重实践，抓住精华，学得精通的精神，专业课程和专业教学时间砍掉了三分之二。
    这个计划受到部队党委和广大指挥员的赞扬，也经受了实践的检验。近两年来，不少上艇不久的战士被送到教导队来学习。由于训练中贯彻了“少而精”的方针，处处从实战需要出发，十分重视实践，他们也能在很短的时间里，最好最快地掌握实战中最需要的本领。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”这个部队的党委和教导队的同志，学习了毛主席的这一指示，回顾了几年来从有实践经验的战士中培养快艇指挥员的道路，深深感到毛主席的指示极其伟大，极其英明，极其正确。他们决心在毛主席最新指示的指引下，发动广大群众，彻底批判资产阶级的反动军事路线和教育路线，进一步有领导有步骤地进行训练改革，把这所“草篷大学”真正办成毛泽东思想大学校，为人民海军的建设做出更大的贡献！          《解放军报》通讯员　新华社记者　本报通讯员
