	Madrid, October 24 (Xinhua) - More than 8,000 coal miners in Oviedo, Spain, went on strike on the 23rd to strongly protest against the mine owners' brutal oppression and exploitation under various pretexts.

	The strike wave began in October. Due to the mine owners' disregard for the workers' lives, the coal mines have poor safety equipment, frequently causing work-related accidents. Recently, miners held a funeral for a worker who died in a work-related accident to protest against the mine owners. The mine owners, however, used the excuse of missing work time to brutally persecute the workers. The mine owners' crimes have sparked immense anger among the workers, who have launched a strike wave to protest against the mine owners' crimes.

	The workers' strike struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the mine owners. It is estimated that, so far, the strike has reduced coal production by 35,000 tons, causing the mine owners to lose 42 million pesetas (Spanish currency).

    反对矿主的压迫和剥削
    西班牙八千多名矿工举行罢工
    新华社二十四日讯　马德里消息：西班牙奥维亚多的八千多名煤矿工人二十三日举行罢工，强烈抗议矿主寻找各种借口对工人进行横蛮的压迫和剥削。
    这次罢工浪潮是在十月份开始的。由于矿主不顾工人死活，煤矿安全设备很差，不断造成工伤事故。不久前，矿工们为一名因工伤事故牺牲的工人举行葬礼，对矿主表示抗议。矿主竟以耽误工作时间为借口，蛮横地迫害工人。矿主的罪行，激起了工人的巨大愤怒。他们掀起了抗议矿主罪行的罢工浪潮。
    工人的罢工斗争给了矿主以沉重打击。据估计，到目前为止，罢工已使得煤产量减少三万五千吨，使矿主损失了四千二百万比塞塔（西班牙币名）。
