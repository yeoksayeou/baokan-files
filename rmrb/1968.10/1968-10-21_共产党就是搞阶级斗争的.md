The great leader Chairman Mao recently issued new instructions on party rectification work: "...A proletarian party must also expel the old and absorb the new to remain vigorous. Without eliminating waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lose its vitality." Chairman Mao's new instructions speak to the hearts of our People's Liberation Army soldiers. We firmly support and resolutely carry out these instructions.

In the matter of party building, there has always been a sharp and complex struggle between two lines. Chairman Mao has consistently emphasized that party building, rectification, and development must be closely tied to the fundamental issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the correct line in party building. Chairman Mao has pointed out to us: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy." This clearly defines the Communist Party as a tool of class struggle, and the Communist Party is indeed engaged in class struggle.

However, the old counter-revolutionary revisionist, Liu Shaoqi, driven by his evil intentions to usurp the party and the government and restore capitalism, has long been promoting a revisionist line of party building. He has been wildly advocating the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of peace within the party," denying the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attempting to stifle the revolutionary nature of the proletarian party, causing the proletarian revolutionary party to degenerate. Liu Shaoqi has been recruiting traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements into the party, seizing leadership positions, and attempting to turn the party into a revisionist party and the country into a revisionist state.

I was sent to the Shanghai Weiyang Electrical Appliance Factory to support the left. Previously, the capitalist roaders within the party in this factory vigorously promoted the revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shanghai. They openly propagated that this factory was a "three-no" factory with no landlords, capitalists, or counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, the poison of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of peace within the party" was widespread in this factory. Some bad elements took the opportunity to infiltrate the party, and capitalist thoughts spread rampantly. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Communist Party members and revolutionary masses, under the call of Chairman Mao, took action to expose and criticize a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the party. However, class struggle did not end there.

At the beginning of this year, after the revolutionary committee of the factory was established, due to a temporary relaxation in the struggle against the enemy, the class enemy took the opportunity to act. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists colluded with the capitalist roaders, fiercely stirring up waves of revisionist winds in the factory, seriously disrupting the revolution and production, and interfering with the Cultural Revolution. The living facts of class struggle educated the revolutionary committee of the factory: to consolidate the new red political power, it is necessary to firmly grasp class struggle and resolutely strike back against the provocations of the class enemy. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary committee of the factory and the military representative worked together to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on party building and class struggle, and Chairman Mao's policies and strategies for fighting against the enemy. They fully mobilized the masses, firmly grasped class struggle. The revolutionary workers of the entire factory, with deep class hatred towards Liu Shaoqi and deep class love for Chairman Mao, carried forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, launched a fierce attack on the class enemy, and crushed the revisionist winds stirred up by a handful of traitors and class enemies. Under the powerful force of the dictatorship of the masses, one hidden enemy after another was exposed. "Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." The revolutionary situation in the entire factory is getting better and better, and production is booming. Through several months of class struggle, the party organization has been tempered in class struggle and has become a vigorous command center leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy.

The practice of class struggle has completely smashed the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" advocated by Liu Shaoqi.

    共产党就是搞阶级斗争的
    南京空军工程部　王三全
    伟大领袖毛主席最近又发出了关于整党工作的最新指示：“……一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”毛主席的最新指示说出了我们人民解放军战士的心里话，我们坚决拥护，坚决执行。
    在党的建设问题上，一直存在着极其尖锐复杂的两条路线的斗争。把党的建设、整顿和发展，和无产阶级专政这个根本问题紧紧结合起来，这是伟大领袖毛主席在党的建设上的一贯思想，是唯一正确的路线。毛主席给我们指出：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”这就明确地给我们规定了，共产党是阶级斗争的工具，共产党就是搞阶级斗争的。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命修正主义分子，出于他篡党、篡政，复辟资本主义的罪恶需要，长期以来疯狂地推行一条修正主义建党路线，大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”“党内和平论”，否定无产阶级专政，妄想扼杀党的无产阶级革命性，使无产阶级革命党蜕化变质。中国赫鲁晓夫招降纳叛，结党营私，把叛徒、特务、地富反坏右分子拉进党内，攫取领导职位，妄图使党变修，国家变色。
    我在上海卫阳电器厂支左。过去，这个厂党内走资派竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人的一套修正主义路线。他们公开散布这个厂是一个无地主、无资本家、无反革命的“三无”厂。因此，在这个厂里“阶级斗争熄灭论”“党内和平论”的流毒甚广。一些坏人乘机钻进了党内，资本主义思想严重泛滥。在无产阶级文化大革命中，共产党员和广大革命群众在毛主席的号召下行动起来，揭露和批判了钻进党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和其他反革命分子。但是阶级斗争并没有就此结束。
    今年年初，厂革命委员会成立后，由于一度放松了对敌斗争，阶级敌人又乘机活动。地、富、反、坏、右分子，同走资派互相勾结起来，猖狂地在厂里刮起一阵阵翻案妖风，严重地破坏了抓革命，促生产，干扰了文化大革命运动。阶级斗争的活生生事实教育了厂革命委员会：要巩固新生的红色政权，必须狠抓阶级斗争，迎头痛击阶级敌人的挑衅。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，厂革委会和军代表结合起来，大办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席有关党的建设和阶级斗争学说，学习毛主席有关对敌斗争的方针政策和策略，充分发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争。全厂革命职工带着对中国赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨，怀着对毛主席无比热爱的深厚阶级感情，发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，向阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，击溃了一小撮汉奸、阶级异己分子等掀起的右倾翻案妖风。在群众专政的强大威力下，挖出了一个又一个隐藏的敌人。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”全厂革命形势越来越好，生产蒸蒸日上。经过几个月来的阶级斗争，党组织在阶级斗争中，得到了锻炼，成了领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
    阶级斗争的实践彻底砸烂了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。
