The Red Heart Commune: Wan Fa Kuang Says:

What took nineteen years, we did in one

We peasants of the Red Heart Commune, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have taken over the management of all the schools in the commune. When we entered the schools, most of the teachers welcomed us, and they actively supported the educational revolution. However, for a period of time, they worked behind closed doors, and no matter how they tried, they still couldn't achieve anything. For example, setting up a junior high school within the primary school was something the poor and lower-middle peasants urgently needed, and most teachers agreed to do it. But they had so many old ideas in their heads that not a single class was set up. After we peasants entered the school, we held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with them. Whenever there were practical difficulties, we mobilized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to solve them together. For instance, someone worried that the higher authorities might not approve of setting up a junior high school class. How would the student registration problem be solved? They also worried about the lack of teachers and school buildings. When these problems were raised, the poor and lower-middle peasants answered them based on Chairman Mao's teachings. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Chairman Mao approved the setting up of junior high school classes within primary schools as early as 1957. 'Primary schools setting up junior high school classes, this method is a good method, an advanced experience.' We will do as Chairman Mao said. We send our children to school to learn Mao Zedong Thought and scientific knowledge. As long as they can learn it, they can return to the countryside and be useful. Who cares about registration or not? There were not enough teachers, so the poor and lower-middle peasants broke down the strict division between public and private school teachers, changed the irrational use of teachers, and unified the adjustment and use of all teachers in the commune; the poor and lower-middle peasants also selected a few excellent returned educated youth to serve as teachers, solving the problem of insufficient teachers. There were not enough school buildings, so the poor and lower-middle peasants actively and voluntarily helped the school to repair and build school buildings. In a short time and without spending much money, they repaired and built twenty classrooms.

In this way, the entire commune quickly set up six junior high school classes and one senior high school class, with a total of 380 students. Because junior high school classes were set up, 95% of primary school graduates could enter junior high school. We did the math: in the past, the commune sent an average of 10 to 15 students to the district for junior high school each year. If we continued at this rate, it would take at least 19 years to send this year's primary school graduates to junior high school. But we did it in one year. Many teachers were deeply moved. A primary school principal later told someone: "The poor and lower-middle peasants have shaken up our old ideas, making me truly understand Chairman Mao's teaching: 'Intellectuals, if they do not integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, will achieve nothing.'"

    赤心公社　万发宽说：
    十九年才能办到的事我们一年办到了
    我们公社贫下中农遵照毛主席的指示，管理了全公社的学校。我们进学校，大多数教师是欢迎的，他们对教育革命也是积极拥护的。但是，前一段时间，他们关起门搞，结果搞来搞去，还是没有搞出啥名堂。象办小学附设初中班，这是贫下中农迫切要求的事，多数教师也赞成办，可是他们脑子里有好多框框，一个班也没办起来。我们贫下中农进校后，和他们一起办毛泽东思想学习班，有实际困难就发动广大贫下中农一起动手解决。比如，有人担心办初中班上级批不准怎么办？学生学籍问题怎么解决？又担心师资不好找，校舍又缺乏。这些问题一提出来，贫下中农便根据毛主席的教导作出了回答。贫下中农说，小学附设初中班毛主席早在一九五七年不是就批准了吗？“小学校附设初中班，这种办法还是好办法，先进经验。”就照毛主席说的办。我们送子女上学，是为了学习毛泽东思想，学习科学知识，只要能学到手，回到农村起作用，管他学籍不学籍。教师少，贫下中农就把过去分得很严的公办、民办教师的界限打破，改变使用不合理的情况，全公社教师统一调整，集中使用；贫下中农又推选了几个优秀的回乡知识青年来担任教师，师资不够的问题也解决了。校舍不够用，贫下中农就积极主动地到学校帮助整修校舍，没有多久时间，也没花好多钱，就整修和新修了二十间教室。
    就这样，全公社很快办起了六个初中班，还有一个高中班，共有学生三百八十多人。由于办起了中学班，小学毕业生百分之九十五都可入中学。我们算了一笔账：过去每年全社输送到区里的初中生通常是十到十五名，按这个速度来输送这次的小学毕业生，至少要十九年，而我们一年就把它办到了。许多教师很受感动，一位小学校长事后对人说：贫下中农把我们的旧思想冲了一下，使我真正懂得了毛主席的教导：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”
