Let Youth Shine Forever
—A Letter from a Classmate Who Went to the Border

Dear Comrade-in-Arms:

In the days of celebration for the 19th anniversary of the founding of New China, let us first pay our highest respects to the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

Dear Comrade-in-Arms:

Do you still remember, half a year ago today, we bathed in the spring breeze of the Huangpu River, facing the radiant sunrise of the East, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, carrying four volumes of precious books, we set out on the path of integrating intellectuals with workers, peasants, and soldiers, each heading to a new battlefield: you, gripping a rifle, guarding the heart of the motherland, Beijing; I, wielding a shepherd's crook, fighting on the frontline of anti-revisionism and anti-imperialism in Xinjiang!

At the welcoming meeting upon my arrival, I received a vivid class education lesson that I will never forget: the old herdsman, Buyimaiti Uncle, holding a blood-stained garment, his eyes flashing with anger, began to speak:

“I started being a slave at the age of twelve, my blood and sweat fattened the cattle and sheep of the landlords. On the fifteenth day of the lunar month that year, a blizzard took away a lamb, the landlord killed my father, his whip lashed me until I was half-dead, my body covered in wounds!

To avenge my father, I kept this blood-stained garment for a long time.”

Listening to Buyimaiti Uncle’s accusations, I thought of my parents who were killed by the landlord. Landlords and Baoyi are the same, poisonous as snakes and fierce as wolves!

But, the Chinese Khrushchev, shouts: “Exploitation is glorious,” and peddles the black “Cultivation of the Self,” trying to make us forget class hatred, realizing his dream of restoring capitalism. It won’t work! It will never work!

The descendants of the working people will never disappoint the expectations of our predecessors! Class education made me love Chairman Mao even more, and I became more determined to devote myself to revolutionary herding.

Every morning, to the tune of “The East Is Red,” we leave our tents, herding cattle and sheep. The vast grasslands became the battlefield for “seizing the revolution and promoting production.” The roars denouncing the Chinese Khrushchev shook the earth, the crack of the whip echoed in the clear sky for thousands of miles.

Every evening, we play the winter notla, and joyful songs spread in all directions, praising the great leader Chairman Mao, propagating the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

We also set up study classes, and everyone chose me to be the instructor. Buyimaiti Uncle and I formed a “red pair.” I read the “Three Articles” to him, and he helped me reform my thoughts. Under the lamplight, we fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism together; in the wind and rain, we guarded the cattle and sheep together; during herding, he taught me seriously and earnestly; in life, he asked me to carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work and simplicity.

In these extraordinary 180 days, I deeply felt that every laboring person here is my best and most respectable teacher; every piece of green pasture here is my classroom for learning Mao Zedong Thought.

Dear Comrade-in-Arms, I have another piece of good news to share: our “red pair” were both rated as active promoters of Mao Zedong Thought, and on the day the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was established, we were invited to the stage.

But I feel that I have not done enough, and the achievements I have made should be attributed to the great leader—Chairman Mao, and the beloved Party.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: “Most or a large majority of students from old schools can integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some have made inventions and creations, but they need to be re-educated by workers, peasants, and soldiers under the correct leadership, to thoroughly change their old thoughts. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.”

Chairman Mao’s latest instructions are the great cause of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism for a hundred years, pointing out the direction of victory for the educational revolution. I am determined, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to further cultivate the feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers, temper the thoughts of workers, peasants, and soldiers, be a student of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and let youth shine forever.

Dear Comrade-in-Arms, on National Day, when you go to Tiananmen Square, please give my regards to Chairman Mao and tell him of my determination.

Finally, I wish that on different battlefronts, we will always stand guard for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, fight well, and let our great socialist motherland stand tall and proud in the East!

Yours in arms, Xiangyang
September 25, 1968, Pamir Pasture

    让青春永放光芒
    ——一位支边同学的来信
    阎军　赞兵
    亲爱的战友：
    在欢庆新中国诞生十九周年的沸腾日子里，
    首先，让我们共同敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    亲爱的战友：
    你可还记得，
    恰是半年前的今天，
    浴着黄浦江畔的春风，
    迎着东方灿烂的朝阳，
    我们满怀革命的豪情，
    四卷宝书带在身上，
    沿着知识分子同工农兵相结合的大道，
    各自奔赴新的战场：
    你，紧握钢枪，
    守卫在祖国的心脏北京，
    我，挥舞牧鞭，
    战斗在反修反帝的前哨——新疆！
    初来的欢迎会上，
    就上了一堂生动的阶级教育课，使我终生难忘：
    老牧民买买提大叔，
    拿着一件血染的衣裳，
    眼里喷射出愤怒的火焰，
    开口把话讲：
    “我十二岁就开始当奴隶，
    血汗养肥了巴依的牛羊，
    就在那年的腊月十五，
    暴风雪卷走了一只羊羔，
    巴依逼死了我的父亲，
    皮鞭抽得我死去活来，遍体鳞伤！
    为了报仇雪恨，
    我把这血衣久久收藏。”
    听着买买提大叔的控诉，
    使我想起了被地主夺去生命的爹娘。
    巴依、地主一个样，
    毒如蛇蝎狠如狼！
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫，
    却叫嚷：“剥削有功”，
    大肆贩卖黑《修养》，
    他妄图让我们忘掉阶级仇，
    实现他复辟资本主义的梦想。
    办不到！永远办不到！
    劳动人民的后代，
    决不辜负前辈的期望！
    阶级教育使我更加热爱毛主席，
    坚定了为革命放牧的思想。
    每天早晨，
    在《东方红》的歌声中，
    我们走出帐篷赶着牛羊，
    辽阔的草原成了“抓革命，促生产”的战场。
    声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的怒吼声震撼着大地，
    牧鞭的脆响在万里晴空回旋激荡。
    每天傍晚，
    我们弹起冬不拉，
    欢乐的赞歌传遍了四面八方，
    颂扬伟大领袖毛主席，
    宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    我们还办起了学习班，
    大伙儿选我把辅导员当。
    我和买买提大叔结成了“一对红”，
    我给他读“老三篇”，
    他帮我改造思想。
    灯光下，
    我俩一起斗私批修；
    风雨里，
    我俩一起守护牛羊；
    放牧时，
    他口传身教，严肃认真；
    生活中，
    他要求我把艰苦朴素的光荣传统发扬。
    不平凡的一百八十天啊，
    我深深地感到：
    这里的每一个劳动人民，
    都是我最好的、最可尊敬的老师；
    这里的每一块碧绿牧场，
    都是我学习毛泽东思想的课堂……
    亲爱的战友，
    还要告诉你喜事一桩：
    我们“一对红”都被评为学习毛泽东思想的积极分子，
    自治区革委会成立那天，
    我俩被请到了主席台上。
    但是，我觉得自己做得还很不够，
    所取得的这点成绩，
    应归功于伟大领袖——毛主席，敬爱的党。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”
    毛主席的最新指示，
    是反修防修的百年大计，
    给教育革命指出了胜利的航向。
    我决心在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，
    更进一步地培养工农兵的感情，
    锤炼工农兵的思想，
    当工农兵的小学生，
    让青春
    永放光芒。
    亲爱的战友：
    国庆节那天，
    你去到天安门广场，
    请代我向毛主席他老人家问好，
    把我的决心给他老人家讲一讲……
    最后，愿我们在不同的战斗岗位上，
    时刻为毛主席的革命路线，放好哨，站好岗，打好仗！
    让我们伟大的社会主义祖国，
    以更加雄伟的英姿屹立在世界东方！
                  您的战友：向阳
          一九六八年九月二十五日于帕米尔牧场
