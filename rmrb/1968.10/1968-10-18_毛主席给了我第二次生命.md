Chairman Mao Gave Me a Second Life
Beijing Railway Bureau Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works, Deputy Squad Leader of Beijing Carriage Section, Jingfu Line Four, New Party Member Wang Degui

I heard on the radio the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao: "A person has arteries and veins, through the heart to circulate blood, and through the lungs to breathe, exhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen, this is called expelling the old and taking in the new. A proletarian party must also expel the old and take in the new to be full of vigor. Without eliminating waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will have no vigor." My heart surged with emotion, my blood boiled, and I was so excited that my heart seemed to jump out of my chest. I couldn't help but raise my fist and shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like a beacon, illuminating the path for the current struggle, criticism, and reform, and pointing out the direction for our party's advance.

Paying attention to the party's construction within the worker ranks and promoting revolutionary vigor is a consistent thought of our great leader Chairman Mao. As early as 1950, Chairman Mao pointed out wisely: "We must pay attention to gradually recruiting awakened workers into the party, expanding the worker component of the party organization." Recently, Chairman Mao taught us again: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against class enemies." However, for a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department have been vigorously promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist line of party building, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian line of party building, and vigorously advocating the rotten goods of revisionism such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of the tamed tool." On the one hand, they have been busy with capitulation and collusion, forming cliques, and using every means to shelter traitors, spies, labor bosses, and counter-revolutionaries into the party to seize leadership positions. On the other hand, they have been trying every means to exclude outstanding workers and peasants from joining the party, attempting to change the nature of the party.

Take my personal situation as an example. I lost my parents at the age of ten and began to wander and beg for food. Later, I was captured by the Japanese devils to the "Anshan Iron and Steel Works" in the Northeast to work as a laborer. Once, I contracted an infectious disease and was almost buried alive by the foreman. Fortunately, my fellow workers saved me. At that time, I was thinking every day, when will we poor people stop suffering? This day finally came, the troops of our great leader Chairman Mao arrived! I was so happy when I heard the news that I immediately ran to Liaoyang, found the Communist Party, and joined the Eighth Route Army.

In this great school of the army, I understood what class and exploitation are, understood the meaning of revolution, and thus loved the Communist Party more, loved Chairman Mao more, and became more determined to revolutionize to the end. In the Black Mountain ambush and the battle of Hejia Oil Room, I achieved two major merits. Later, I was wounded three times in glory. Although I was not old enough at the time, I had already made up my mind to join the Communist Party and devote my life to the cause of communism.

Later, I was demobilized due to illness (wounds) and transferred to work in the Beijing Carriage Section. However, I never expected that the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in the railway department would say I have a "mental illness" and am a "madman" because I love Chairman Mao's works and insist on hanging Chairman Mao's portrait, calling me a "scoundrel." I was so angry that I almost burst my lungs, and I had several face-to-face confrontations with them. They then spread rumors that "good people don't transfer, transferred people are not good," saying I was "making trouble," and that I wanted to "rebel." They seized on some of my shortcomings and relentlessly attacked and marginalized me. Later, when I applied to join the Communist Party several times and wrote applications, they viciously said, "A mentally ill person wants to join the party, stand aside!" and returned my application forms.

With a thunderous roar, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, thoroughly smashed the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various departments to restore capitalism. At this time, I finally realized that the reason I was attacked was that the big villain Chinese Khrushchev and his agents were playing tricks! I harbored deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and, together with the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians, thoroughly exposed the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department, seized their power, and overthrew their regime. Later, I was honored to be evaluated as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and attended the division, bureau, and Beijing industrial and commercial mouth active learners of Chairman Mao's works representatives' conference. On August 15 of this year, I was fortunate to be received by our great leader Chairman Mao as one of the workers' representatives from the capital!

On September 30 of this year, my long-cherished wish finally came true, and I was honored to join the Communist Party of China! My heart is so excited, and tears of happiness flow down as I look up at Chairman Mao's portrait. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you, old man, who saved me, a lonely and miserable child, from the fire; it is you, old man, who nurtured me to grow up; it is you, old man, who saved me, a "mentally ill" person whose political status was stripped away by the Chinese Khrushchev, and gave me a second life, allowing me to join the Communist Party of China in glory. Truly, the greatness of Chairman Mao's grace is greater than the heavens and the earth, and the depth of Chairman Mao's grace is deeper than that of parents!

Now, I have honorably joined the capital workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and entered the school. I am determined to more resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, actively participate in the great movement of party rectification and construction, deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line of party building, and expel all the traitors, spies, all counter-revolutionaries, stubborn diehards, class enemies, and degenerate elements with conclusive evidence from our party! At the same time, I am determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strive to temper myself in the great waves of class struggle into a genuine good party member who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    毛主席给了我第二次生命
    北京铁路局学习毛主席著作积极分子北京列车段、京福四连副连长新党员　王德贵
    我从广播里听到我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“一个人有动脉，静脉，通过心脏进行血液循环，还要通过肺部进行呼吸，呼出二氧化碳，吸进新鲜氧气，这就是吐故纳新。一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”心潮澎湃，热血沸腾，激动得心都快要跳出来了，我情不自禁地振臂高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    毛主席的最新指示，象一盏光芒四射的指路明灯，照亮了当前斗、批、改的道路，指明了我党前进的方向。
    重视工人队伍中党的建设，重视发扬革命朝气，是我们伟大领袖毛主席的一贯思想。早在一九五○年，毛主席就英明指出：“必须注意有步骤地吸收觉悟工人入党，扩大党的组织的工人成份。”最近毛主席又教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”可是，长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路部门的代理人，却极力推行一套反革命修正主义建党路线，拚命同毛主席的无产阶级建党路线相对抗，大肆宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“驯服工具论”等等修正主义破烂货。他们一方面大搞招降纳叛，结党营私，想方设法地包庇叛徒、特务、工贼、反革命分子混入党内，攫取领导职务，另一方面又千方百计地排挤工农优秀分子入党，妄图改变党的性质。
    就拿我个人的情况来说吧。我十岁失去父母，开始到处流浪讨饭，后来被日本狗强盗抓到东北“鞍山制钢所”去当劳工。一次，我得了传染病，差点被工头活活埋掉，多亏工人兄弟们把我救了出来。那时我整日在想，咱们穷人受苦受到什么时候才算到头啊！这一天终于盼到了，我们伟大领袖毛主席的队伍来了！我听到这个消息，可高兴啦，立即跑到辽阳，找到了共产党，参加了八路军。
    在部队这所大学校里，我懂得了什么是阶级和剥削，懂得了革命的道理，就更加热爱共产党，更加热爱毛主席，更加坚定了革命到底的决心。在黑山阻击战和何家油房的战斗中，我立了两次大功，后来又三次光荣负伤。当时我虽然不够年龄，但我已下定决心，一定要加入共产党，为共产主义事业奋斗终生。
    后来，我因病（负伤）复员到地方，又调到北京列车段工作。可是，万万没有想到，中国赫鲁晓夫在铁路部门的代理人，因为我热爱毛主席著作和坚持要挂毛主席像，竟说我有“精神病”，是“疯子”，骂我是“混蛋”。我听到这些，肺都快要气炸了，几次和他们进行了面对面的斗争。他们就给我散布什么“好人不转业，转业的没好人”、“调皮捣蛋”，说我要“造反”。并抓住我某些方面的缺点，拚命打击我，排挤我。后来，我几次要加入共产党，并写了申请，他们更是恶狠狠地说什么：“精神病还想入党，还是靠边站吧！”把我的申请书给退了回来。
    霹雳一声震天响，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各部门的代理人妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。这时，我才恍然大悟，我所以受打击，原来是中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋和他的代理人搞的鬼！我满怀对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，同广大无产阶级革命派一起，大造了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路部门代理人的反，夺了他们的权，专了他们的政。以后，我被光荣地评为学习毛主席著作积极分子，先后出席了分局、路局和北京工交口活学活用毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。今年八月十五日，我又作为首都工人代表之一，幸福地受到了我们的伟大领袖毛主席的接见！
    今年九月三十日，我多年的愿望终于实现了，我光荣地加入了中国共产党！我的心是多么的激动啊，两眼仰望着毛主席像，幸福的热泪刷的流了下来。毛主席啊，毛主席！是您老人家把我这个孤苦伶仃的苦孩子救出了火海，培育我长大成人；又是您老人家把我这个被中国赫鲁晓夫剥夺了政治地位的“精神病”人救了出来，给了我第二次生命，使我能够光荣地加入了中国共产党。真是天大地大不如毛主席您老人家的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席您老人家的恩情深啊！
    现在，我光荣地参加了首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进入学校。我决心更坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，积极投入伟大的整党建党运动，深入开展革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的流毒，把混入我们党内的证据确凿的叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子、顽固不化的走资派、阶级异己分子、蜕化变质分子，统统清除出去！同时，我还决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，努力把自己锻炼成为一个无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的名副其实的好党员。
