In the drive of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the agricultural machinery industry in Shandong Province has achieved rapid development. Over the past two years, the production capacity of agricultural machinery factories built throughout the province has doubled the total of the seventeen years before 1966.

In the matter of agricultural technical transformation, there has long been a sharp struggle between two lines in Shandong Province. Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shandong have consistently opposed Chairman Mao's directives on agricultural mechanization. They have ruthlessly cut down the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry and agricultural machinery scientific research, causing the level of agricultural mechanization in Shandong Province to stagnate. During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres on the industrial front in Shandong Province seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. With the invincible thought of Mao Zedong as their weapon, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shandong, promoting the rapid development of agricultural machinery production and construction. At present, the entire agricultural machinery industry front in Shandong Province is in full swing with revolutionary fervor, and production is booming.

In the construction of the agricultural machinery industry, the broad revolutionary masses have earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, striving for self-reliance and self-strengthening, and launching mass movements. Over the past two years, the province has manufactured more than a thousand sets of equipment on its own and built or renovated eleven agricultural power machinery factories and more than twenty component factories. At present, most regions in the province have agricultural power machinery factories.

    山东农业机械工业迅速发展
    两年多来全省兴建的农业机械厂的生产能力比一九六六年以前十七年的总和增长两倍
    据新华社济南二十一日电  在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，山东省农业机械工业获得迅速发展。两年多来全省兴建的农业机械厂的生产能力比一九六六年以前十七年的总和增长两倍。
    山东省在农业技术改造的问题上，一直存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东的代理人，一贯对抗毛主席关于农业机械化的指示，大杀大砍农业机器制造工业和农机科学研究事业，使山东省农业机械化水平停滞不前。文化大革命中，山东省工业战线上的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，推动了农机工业生产建设的迅速发展。目前，山东省整个农机工业战线，革命轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。
    在农机工业的建设中，广大革命职工认真贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，奋发图强，自力更生，大搞群众运动。近两年当中，全省自造设备一千多台，新建、改建了十一个农业动力机械厂和二十多个配件厂。目前，全省绝大部分地区，都有了农业动力机械厂。
