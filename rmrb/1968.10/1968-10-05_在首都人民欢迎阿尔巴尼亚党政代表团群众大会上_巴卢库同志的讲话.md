Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear Comrade Kang Sheng, dear workers of Beijing, dear members of the people's commune, dear comrades in the glorious People's Liberation Army, dear Red Guards, and dear comrades of the revolutionary masses:

Allow me, with a heart full of joy and the highest respect, to convey to you, the participants of this mass rally, and through you, to the entire brotherly Chinese people, the most enthusiastic and heartfelt greetings from the Albanian people, the Albanian Party of Labour, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and Comrade Enver Hoxha himself.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, has achieved one decisive victory after another throughout the great socialist country of China. We sincerely congratulate you on these brilliant victories and express our firm belief that new and even more glorious victories await you on your glorious revolutionary path. The great Chinese Communist Party, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, with its rare courage and bravery, is leading the great Chinese people in an unceasing march towards new revolutionary victories. This is the most reliable guarantee for continuous progress. Revolutionary China, which has experienced many legendary heroic battles in the armed people's revolution, and the China of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with this correct and far-sighted Marxist-Leninist leadership, is today a sea of red, shining its bright light to the world in all directions.

The establishment of revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except Taiwan has presented a magnificent spectacle across the entire People's Republic of China. It is in these unprecedented days of fervent enthusiasm that we have come to your great and powerful motherland, feeling fortunate. When we see the great Chinese people, workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary intellectuals, young and old, living in such a good revolutionary atmosphere brought about by the decisive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we feel immense joy.

From the "January Storm" in Shanghai to the establishment of revolutionary committees throughout China, in nearly two years, the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of workers have responded to and implemented Chairman Mao Zedong's great call to "unite the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." You, the revolutionary masses of the Chinese proletariat, have fought with extraordinary heroism, immediately rising up to defend the victories of socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat. United as one, armed with the great thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong, you have raised your iron fists and defeated the traitors of the Chinese revolution and the people. You have ensured the brilliant victory of the proletarian line represented by Chairman Mao Zedong. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents have suffered a shameful and disastrous defeat. Their counter-revolutionary revisionist plots to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie have been burned to ashes by the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as a great political and ideological revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev, has made it entirely possible for the People's Republic of China to remain red forever. It has ensured that the invincible thought of Mao Zedong will forever be the great banner of victory for the brotherly Chinese people, passed down from generation to generation. The great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have finally shattered the counter-revolutionary plots of the US imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, who have tried in every way to implement "peaceful evolution," restore capitalism, and promote revisionism in China.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has demonstrated the boundless power of the billion revolutionary masses of the great Chinese people and the vitality of Comrade Mao Zedong's great Marxist-Leninist thought. It has further strengthened and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat in China. Comrade Mao Zedong, with his theoretical and practical guidance, has further enriched Marxism-Leninism. The people of our country, the Albanian Party of Labour, and our government sincerely congratulate the brotherly Chinese people on these victories of world historical significance and regard these victories as our own, as a great contribution to the world revolutionary cause.

Recently, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has issued a new great call to the Chinese people, urging them to engage in new battles, strengthen the unified leadership of the three-in-one revolutionary committees, carry out thorough criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify and build the Party, streamline organizations, and reform the irrational regulations of the superstructure.

The new important tasks proposed by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin reflect the objective laws of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now, this revolution has entered the new stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The completion of these new tasks will ensure the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the continued and uninterrupted development of the socialist revolution in the People's Republic of China.

You, the revolutionary masses of the Chinese proletariat, are following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and implementing Chairman Mao Zedong's highest directive to "fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work."

The glorious working class of China, with high revolutionary consciousness and following the teachings of Chairman Mao, is full of vigor and is bringing the lofty class spirit into colleges, universities, and other cultural and educational institutions.

Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters, armed with the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong as a powerful ideological weapon, you are uniting the will and steps of the Chinese people. All of this has greatly raised the political and ideological level of the great seven hundred million Chinese people, strengthened and will continue to strengthen the revolutionary vigilance against the enemies of the People's Republic of China at home and abroad. This will make your great and powerful motherland—revolutionary red China illuminated by the invincible thought of Mao Zedong—even more glorious in the eyes of the people of the world. We once again express our firm belief that you, the revolutionary masses of the Chinese proletariat, will, as always, accurately implement the new tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, you will surely achieve the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrades and brothers in revolution, the development of the international situation is favorable to the people and revolution of all countries, and unfavorable to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Revolutionary people are bravely rising up, and the revolutionary storm is fiercely sweeping away the imperialism led by the United States, the modern revisionism led by the Soviet traitor clique, and the reactionaries of various countries.

The national liberation wars of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are burning fiercely. The revolutionary struggles of the proletariat in capitalist countries are rapidly rising. The forces of Marxism-Leninism are developing and strengthening in the fierce class struggle.

In the heroic struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries for national and social liberation, the peoples of various countries are increasingly convinced that for the revolutionary forces, there is only one way to seize political power through the barrel of a gun, and only armed struggle can guarantee the freedom and independence of the people. Under the wise and tested leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people have conducted an epic, heroic, and uncompromising war, proving this great truth. Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have also conducted a heroic and uncompromising armed struggle, further proving this objective truth.

There is no other way to thoroughly defeat imperialism and modern revisionism!

Currently, as the revolution is developing and maturing, American imperialism and the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet anti-Marxist traitor clique are at their wits' end and are suffering one defeat after another. The two countries are acting as the world's police, and their collusion has reached an astonishing level. The Soviet-American collusion has committed heinous crimes against the freedom and revolution of the peoples of various countries and social progress. The two most reactionary countries in the contemporary world— the Soviet Union and the United States—are colluding to divide spheres of influence and dominate the world, openly trampling on and sacrificing the interests of the peoples of various countries. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the peoples of various countries around the world have already grasped a large number of facts about the heinous crimes of the Soviet-American collusion against the peoples of various countries and the revolution, and they strongly condemn them. The signing of the treaty to prohibit the proliferation of nuclear weapons is also a result of the Soviet-American collusion. In the imperialist-Israeli war of aggression, the Soviet revisionist clique, in order to achieve Soviet-American collusion, sacrificed the freedom and independence of the Arab people.

The heroic struggle of the brotherly Vietnamese people for freedom, national independence, and against American imperialism is a shining example for the people of the world. To strengthen the Soviet-American collusion without principles, divide spheres of influence, and dominate the world, the Khrushchev revisionist clique shamelessly betrayed the cause of the Vietnamese people. The invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet revisionist clique and its followers is carried out with the tacit approval of their American imperialist partners. This fascist-style occupation of Czechoslovakia under the infamous Warsaw Pact banner shows that this pact has become an instrument of aggression used by Soviet chauvinists to bully and oppress their member countries. This fact clearly shows that the Warsaw Pact is no different from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The People's Republic of Albania, adhering to the Marxist-Leninist position, resolutely declared the abrogation of the Warsaw Pact, thereby not only safeguarding the interests of Albania but also safeguarding the interests of all revolutionary peoples in the world. The great Chinese people, along with all Marxist-Leninists and true revolutionaries in the world, have strongly supported the revolutionary actions of the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people. The historic telegram from Chairman Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai to Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mehmet Shehu expresses the essence of the revolutionary friendship between our two parties and two peoples. This telegram is a powerful and great support from the brotherly Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong to the Albanian people's just and unyielding struggle against American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism.

The purpose of the Soviet-American counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" is first and foremost to establish a "ring of fire" around the People's Republic of China, because the great revolutionary China is an insurmountable obstacle to their realization of their goals and is a decisive factor in defeating the aggressive plots of imperialism led by American imperialism and modern revisionism led by the Khrushchev revisionist clique. However, the enemies of revolution and socialism should be clear that no force in the world can surround and defeat the great seven hundred million Chinese people. In the world, there is no force now, nor will there ever be, that can stop the People's Republic of China from advancing towards the victory of revolution and socialism.

The revolutionary and armed struggles of the peoples of various countries, the unity of all proletarian revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists in the world in the class struggle, have been strengthened, tempered, and consolidated. This will herald the shameful end of these two ferocious and brutal enemies of all mankind. A new historical period of resolute struggle against American imperialism and Soviet revisionism has begun.

The forces of revolution and social progress on one side, and the forces of aggression and darkness on the other, are engaged in a life-and-death struggle. The great and glorious Chinese people, under the leadership of the great and beloved leader of the world's revolutionary masses, Chairman Mao, stand at the forefront of this struggle.

The brotherly Chinese people, tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, are a shining example of resolute struggle to defeat the plots of American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. The immense and boundless spiritual power of the brotherly seven hundred million Chinese people comes from the great and invincible Marxist-Leninist thought of Chairman Mao, and from the inexhaustible economic and military power of the People's Republic of China. This is the most reliable guarantee for defeating and overcoming American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

The heroic Chinese people are invincible. They are united as one, rallying around the proletarian headquarters, and under the great red banner of revolution, they arm and temper themselves with the great Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, forever advancing from victory to victory, defeating all attempts by American imperialism and Soviet revisionism to dominate the world. The whole world, all progressive humanity that loves peace, takes pride in the fact that today, the giant of China—the most powerful and beloved motherland of the international proletariat—is achieving victory, making the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet traitor clique tremble with fear and die of fright.

When Comrade Enver Hoxha talks about the revolutionary determination and vitality of the heroic Chinese people, he says: "No force in the world can stop the seven hundred million Chinese people from advancing along the path of socialism and communism. The fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will sweep away all class enemies. This cultural revolution will cleanse China of the likes of Khrushchev, turning the beautiful dreams of the imperialists and modern revisionists into ashes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has set a great example for overthrowing the ruling revisionist cliques in the world. People's China will forever be an unshakable fortress of socialism and a powerful base for revolution. The Communist Party of China will forever be the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism."

We are immensely happy that the world's standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism—the great revolutionary China—is our closest ally, friend, brother, and comrade-in-arms. The two countries of China and Albania, our two Marxist-Leninist parties, and our glorious peoples, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, stand firmly in the same trench, at the forefront of the struggle against American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. We will forever be united, fight together, and win together.

The Albanian people, united as one, stand firmly around the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, ready for battle, working and vigilantly defending the socialist motherland to further revolutionize all aspects of national life.

The thoughts and actions of our two countries, two Marxist-Leninist parties, and our revolutionary peoples are in complete harmony. Our friendship is eternal and evergreen because the lofty principles of Marxism-Leninism that temper and test this revolutionary friendship are eternal and immortal. This friendship is a great example of the internationalist cooperation and unity of our two peoples. In the face of our two peoples and the great iron-like unity of our two countries, and in the face of our internationalist unity with the progressive and revolutionary peoples of the world, imperialism and modern revisionism are weak. Anyone who dares to destroy the great and eternal friendship between Albania and China, anyone who dares to invade China and Albania, will surely meet with irrevocable and disastrous failure. Under the leadership of our two Marxist-Leninist parties, and under the education of proletarian ideology, our revolutionary armies of the two countries are the most intimate and loyal armies of the workers and peasants, the vigilant defenders of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the victory of socialism, and the great revolutionary cause.

Dear comrades, we assure you, the brotherly Chinese people, the great Communist Party of China, and our most beloved Comrade Mao Zedong, that the Albanian people and the Albanian Party of Labour, under the wise and tested leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the intimate friend of the Chinese people, will cherish our eternal friendship as we cherish our own eyes. We will continuously strengthen and consolidate this friendship, making this great revolutionary friendship a great and victorious banner in the decisive struggle of our two peoples and the world proletarian revolutionaries for the victory of revolution, socialism, and communism.

Long live the great, unbreakable, and eternal friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live our two Marxist-Leninist parties and our great leaders, Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live the loyal army of the dictatorship of the proletariat under the command of Comrade Lin Biao, the intimate comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao—the glorious People's Liberation Army of China!

Glory to Marxism-Leninism!

    在首都人民欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团群众大会上
    巴卢库同志的讲话
    新华社四日讯　贝基尔·巴卢库同志在首都人民欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团群众大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的康生同志，亲爱的北京工人同志们，人民公社社员同志们，光荣的中国人民解放军指战员同志们，红卫兵小将们，无产阶级革命派战友们：
    请允许我以十分高兴的心情和最崇高的敬意，向你们，这个群众大会的参加者，并通过你们，向全体兄弟的中国人民转达阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和恩维尔·霍查同志本人的最热烈的、最深情的问候。
    毛泽东主席英明发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，在整个伟大的社会主义中国，已经取得了一个接一个的、决定性的成就。我们由衷地祝贺你们取得的这些光辉的胜利并表示我们充分的信念：在你们光荣的革命道路上，新的、更加辉煌的胜利在等待着你们，因为以毛泽东同志为首的伟大的中国共产党，以其罕见的果敢和勇气，领导着伟大的中国人民。这是始终不断向新的革命胜利而进军的最可靠的保证。革命的中国，在武装的人民革命中经历了多次传奇式的英勇战斗的中国，无产阶级文化大革命的中国，由于有了这个正确的、高瞻远瞩的马克思列宁主义的领导，今天已经是一片红了，她向全世界的四面八方放射出强烈的光芒。
    除台湾省以外的各省、市、自治区革命委员会的全部成立，在整个中华人民共和国展现了一幅最宏伟的图景。正是在这些空前的热情奔放的日子里，我们来到了你们伟大强盛的祖国，感到幸福；当我们看到伟大的中国人民，工农兵、红卫兵和革命知识分子，老老少少，生活在由于无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利所出现的如此大好的革命气氛中，我们感到莫大的喜悦。
    从上海“一月风暴”到全中国全部成立革命委员会，在将近两年的时间内，人民解放军和广大亿万劳动群众，以革命的气概，响应和贯彻了毛泽东主席关于“无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权”的伟大号召。你们，中国的无产阶级革命派以不平凡的英雄姿态进行战斗，立即奋起捍卫社会主义的胜利和无产阶级专政，你们万众一心，用毛泽东主席的伟大思想武装起来，举起你们的铁拳，击败了中国革命的和人民的叛徒，保证了以毛泽东主席为代表的无产阶级路线的光辉胜利。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人遭到了可耻的、灾难性的破产。他们变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的反革命修正主义阴谋诡计，被无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火烧成灰烬。无产阶级文化大革命，作为无产阶级反对资产阶级及其以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的在党内的代理人的一场伟大的政治、思想革命，使中华人民共和国完全有可能永远保持红色，使战无不胜的毛泽东思想永远作为兄弟的中国人民的伟大的胜利旗帜，世世代代地传下去。无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利最终地粉碎了美帝、苏修千方百计地妄图在中国实行“和平演变”、复辟资本主义和大搞修正主义的反革命的阴谋。
    无产阶级文化大革命显示了伟大的中国人民亿万革命群众的无穷无尽的力量，显示了毛泽东同志的伟大的马克思列宁主义思想的生命力，进一步加强和巩固了中国无产阶级专政。毛泽东同志以其理论和实践的教导进一步丰富了马克思列宁主义。我国人民，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和我国政府衷心祝贺兄弟的中国人民所取得的这些具有世界历史意义的胜利，并把这些胜利完全看作是我们的胜利，看作是对世界革命事业的巨大贡献。
    最近，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席对中国人民发出了新的伟大号召，号召中国人民投入新的战斗，加强三结合的革命委员会的一元化的领导，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党建党，精简机构，改革上层建筑不合理的规章制度。
    以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部提出的新的重要任务，反映了无产阶级文化大革命的客观规律。现在，这场革命已进入了斗、批、改的新阶段。胜利完成这些新的任务就能确保无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，确保中华人民共和国的社会主义革命的继续和不断的发展。
    你们，中国无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，正在贯彻毛泽东主席关于“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最高指示。
    光荣的中国工人阶级，以其高度革命觉悟按照毛主席的教导，意气风发，正在把崇高的阶级精神带进大中院校和其它各个文教机关。
    你们在无产阶级司令部的领导下，以毛泽东同志伟大的马克思列宁主义思想为强大的思想武器，正在统一中国人民的意志和步伐。所有这一切，大大提高了伟大的七亿中国人民的政治思想水平，加强了并正在日益加强对中华人民共和国国内外敌人的革命警惕性，必将使你们伟大、强盛的祖国——用战无不胜的毛泽东思想照耀的革命的红色的中国，在全世界人民的眼前变得更加伟大。我们再一次表示深信，你们，中国无产阶级革命派将一如既往，必将准确地贯彻斗、批、改的新任务，并在以中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下，必将夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    革命的同志们和兄弟们，国际形势的发展有利于各国人民和革命，而不利于帝国主义、修正主义和反动派。革命人民正勇敢地起来，革命的风暴正猛烈地冲击以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏联叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族解放战争如火如荼地日益燃烧着。资本主义国家的无产阶级革命斗争正日益迅速高涨。马克思列宁主义力量在阶级大搏斗的烈火中，日益发展和加强。
    在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的民族和社会解放的革命斗争的英勇搏斗中，各国人民日益加深了这样的信念：对革命派来说，只能是枪杆子里面出政权，只有武装斗争才能保障人民的自由和独立。在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的英明和久经考验的领导下，伟大的中国人民所进行的史诗般的英勇的、毫不妥协的战争，证明了这一伟大的真理。以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚共产党（现在的劳动党）的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民所进行的英勇的、毫不妥协的武装斗争，同样更加清楚地证明了这一客观真理。
    要彻底战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义，其它的道路是没有的、也不可能有的！
    目前，正当革命日益发展、日益成熟，美帝国主义和以苏联反马克思主义叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义穷途末路，接二连三地遭到失败的时候，苏美两国都充当了世界的宪兵，这两国的勾结达到了惊人的地步。苏美勾结起来，对各国人民的自由和革命以及社会进步，犯下了滔天罪行。当代最反动的两大国——苏联和美国相勾结妄图划分势力范围，主宰世界，公然践踏和牺牲各国人民的利益。全世界无产阶级革命派和各国人民，已经掌握了苏美勾结反对各国人民、反对革命的滔天罪行的大量事实，对他们严加谴责。这两个帝国主义大国禁止核扩散条约的签定，也是苏美勾结的结果。在帝国主义—以色列的侵略战争中，苏联修正主义集团为了达到苏美勾结，牺牲了阿拉伯人民的自由和独立。
    兄弟的越南人民争取自由、民族独立、反对美帝的英勇战争是全世界人民的光辉榜样。为了加强苏美无原则的勾结、划分势力范围和主宰世界，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团明目张胆地出卖越南人民的事业。苏修及其追随者的军队侵占捷克斯洛伐克，是在他们的美帝国主义伙伴的默许下进行的。这种打着臭名远扬的华沙条约幌子对捷克斯洛伐克人民的法西斯式的侵占，说明了这一条约已经成为苏联沙文主义者用来欺侮和压迫其成员国的侵略工具。这一事实清楚地表明了，华沙条约与北大西洋侵略公约毫无区别。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，坚持马克思列宁主义立场，坚决宣布废除华沙条约，从而不仅维护了阿尔巴尼亚的利益，而且也维护了世界一切革命人民的利益。伟大的中国人民以及同她一道的世界上所有的马克思列宁主义者和真正革命派，有力地支持阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的这一革命行动。毛泽东主席、林彪同志和周恩来同志致恩维尔·霍查同志、穆罕默德·谢胡同志的历史性复电，表达了我们两党和两国人民之间战斗的革命友谊力量的实质。这份电报是兄弟的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志给阿尔巴尼亚人民反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义的正义的、始终不渝的斗争的有力的、极大的支持。
    苏美反革命“神圣同盟”的目的首先是为了建立反对中华人民共和国的“火力包围圈”，因为伟大的革命的中国，是他们实现其目的的不可逾越的障碍，是击败以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和以赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团为首的现代修正主义的侵略阴谋的决定性的因素。但是，革命的和社会主义的敌人要放明白些，世界上没有任何力量能够包围和战胜伟大的七亿中国人民，在世界上现在没有、将来也永远没有任何力量能够阻止中华人民共和国向着革命和社会主义胜利前进。
    各国人民的革命和武装斗争，全世界一切无产阶级革命派和马克思列宁主义者的团结，在阶级搏斗中得到了增强、锻炼和巩固。这将预示着全人类的这两个凶恶、残暴的敌人的可耻下场。坚决反对美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的斗争的新的历史时期已经开始。
    革命和社会进步的势力为一方，侵略和黑暗势力为另一方，在进行着一场你死我活的斗争。伟大的、光荣的中国人民，在中国共产党和全世界一切革命派的伟大的、敬爱的领袖毛主席领导下，站在这场斗争的前列。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中得到进一步锻炼的、用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的兄弟的中国人民，是为击败美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的阴谋而进行坚决斗争的光辉榜样。兄弟的七亿中国人民巨大的、无穷无尽的精神力量，渊源于毛主席的伟大的、战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想，渊源于中华人民共和国取之不尽的经济、军事威力，这是打倒和战胜美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的最可靠的保证。
    英雄的中国人民是不可战胜的，他们万众一心地团结在无产阶级司令部的周围，并在革命的伟大红旗下，用毛泽东同志的伟大的马克思列宁主义思想武装和锻炼自己，永远从胜利走向胜利，打败美帝国主义和苏联修正主义主宰世界的一切企图。全世界、全体爱好和平的进步人类感到自豪的是，今天，中国巨人——国际无产阶级最强大、最敬爱的祖国正在取得胜利，使美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏联叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者心惊胆战，怕得要死。
    恩维尔·霍查同志在谈到英雄的中国人民革命的决心和生命力的时候说：“世界上没有任何力量能阻挡七亿中国人民沿着社会主义和共产主义道路前进。无产阶级文化大革命的烈火将横扫一切阶级敌人。这场文化大革命的烈火将肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫之流，把帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的美梦烧成灰烬。无产阶级文化大革命为推翻世界各地当权的修正主义集团，树立了伟大的范例。人民中国将永远是社会主义的坚不可摧的堡垒，将永远是革命的强大基地，中国共产党将永远是马克思列宁主义的旗手。”
    我们感到无比高兴的是，世界马克思列宁主义的旗手——伟大的革命的中国是我们最亲密的盟国、朋友、兄弟和战友，中阿两国，我们两个马克思列宁主义的党，我们光荣的两国人民，在毛泽东主席和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，坚定地站在同一条战壕里，站在反对美帝国主义、反对苏联现代修正主义斗争的前列。我们将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民，象一个人一样地紧紧团结在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的党中央的周围，严阵以待，为国家全部生活进一步革命化和捍卫社会主义祖国而英勇地劳动并保持警惕。
    我们两国、两个马克思列宁主义党和我们两国革命人民的思想和行动十分一致。我们的友谊是永恒的、万古长青的，因为锤炼和考验这一革命友谊的马克思列宁主义的崇高原则是永恒的、不朽的。这种友谊是我们两国人民国际主义合作和团结的崇高典范。在我们两国人民和两国伟大钢铁般的团结面前，在我们与世界进步和革命人民的国际主义团结面前，帝国主义和现代修正主义是虚弱的。谁胆敢破坏伟大的、永恒的阿中友谊，谁胆敢侵犯中国和阿尔巴尼亚，他就必将自取灭亡，遭到无可挽回的、灾难性的失败。在我们两个马克思列宁主义党的领导下，在无产阶级思想的教育下，我们两国革命的人民军队是工人和农民最亲密的、最忠实的军队，是无产阶级专政、社会主义胜利和伟大革命事业的警觉的捍卫者。
    亲爱的同志们，我们向你们，兄弟的中国人民，伟大的中国共产党和我们最敬爱的毛泽东同志保证，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，在中国人民亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志英明的、久经考验的领导下，将象爱护自己的眼珠一样，来维护我们的永恒友谊，将不断巩固、加强这种友谊，使这一伟大的革命友谊成为我们两国人民和世界无产阶级革命派在争取革命、社会主义和共产主义胜利而进行的决定性的斗争中的一面伟大的、胜利的旗帜。
    阿中两国人民伟大的、牢不可破的、永恒的友谊万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！
    我们两个马克思列宁主义的党和我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志指挥的无产阶级专政忠实的军队——光荣的中国人民解放军万岁！
    光荣属于马克思列宁主义！
