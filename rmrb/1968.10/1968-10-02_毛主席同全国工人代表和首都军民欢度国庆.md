**New China News Agency, October 1st**

Our great teacher and great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, today, stood on Tiananmen Rostrum with outstanding representatives of the working class from all over the country and 500,000 military and civilians from the capital, celebrating the great national holiday of the people of all nationalities in our country—the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. A grand celebration and parade were held at Tiananmen Square.

This is a grand holiday celebrating the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; it is a grand holiday where hundreds of millions of military and civilians enthusiastically cheer the working class ascending to the political stage of struggle, criticism, and reform in all domains of the superstructure; it is a grand holiday demonstrating the determination of hundreds of millions of military and civilians to carry out struggle, criticism, and reform and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the early morning, the sun rose brilliantly, shining with countless rays. The vast ranks of workers and revolutionary masses, holding high red flags and clutching red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, gathered at Tiananmen Square and East Chang'an Street. Nearly 10,000 workers from all over the country, representatives of the capital's workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, and Red Guards gathered on the reviewing stand. Also on the reviewing stand were proletarian revolutionary fighters from the five continents, other international friends, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, and overseas Chinese. With hearts full of excitement and joy, they awaited the inspection by the great leader Chairman Mao.

The festive Tiananmen Square was exceptionally magnificent. A giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hung high in the center of the red wall. Red flags fluttered and red lanterns hung high on Tiananmen Rostrum. The large banners on both sides of the rostrum shone brightly: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!" "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" On both sides of the square, tall pines and cypresses surrounded the portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. A portrait of Sun Yat-sen also stood in the square.

At 10 a.m., our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao ascended Tiananmen Rostrum with vigorous steps. The orchestra played "The East Is Red." Immediately, Tiananmen Square and the reviewing stand erupted in prolonged, extremely enthusiastic cheers: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao was in excellent health, radiant, full of energy, and frequently waved to the crowd. People waved red copies of the revolutionary classic, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" thousands of times, fully expressing their deep proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. On the square, 100,000 people held flower balls, forming a magnificent pattern of sunflowers facing the sun. Nine giant balloons with red lanterns hung high in the sky above the square, each bearing a golden character expressing the common wish of hundreds of millions of people: "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

With Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, on Tiananmen Rostrum reviewing the parade were Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Ye Qun, Wang Dongxing, and Wen Yucheng.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important speech greatly inspired the revolutionary masses. They enthusiastically shouted: "Follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, earnestly carry out struggle, criticism, and reform!" "With great enthusiasm, strive to be in the forefront, and launch a new upsurge of seizing revolution and promoting production!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The grand mass parade began. The vast parade marched forward with majestic steps towards Tiananmen Square. The fully armed People's Liberation Army, guarding the national flag and emblem of the great motherland, led the way.

A striking model of China's map entered the square. On the bright red map, six golden characters shone: "Revolutionary Committees are good." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, except Taiwan. People dressed in various ethnic costumes sang and danced, enthusiastically shouting: "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the leader and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy!" "Long live Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!"

The working class of the capital, with their great achievements in revolution and production, accepted the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The fighting ranks of the working class marched through Tiananmen Square, and the entire audience shouted in unison: "Salute to the working class!" "The working class must lead everything!" Workers from the steel, coal, textile, and other industries participating in the parade held large red flowers and marched around the giant model of Chairman Mao's full-body statue and the four volumes of the precious book—*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*. They expressed that with their supreme commander Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the leader and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, the working class can fully shoulder the great historical task of leading the struggle, criticism, and reform in all domains of the superstructure.

A model of giant mangoes rolled by. The worker representatives from all over the country on the reviewing stand and the workers of the capital in front of Tiananmen were particularly excited. At this critical moment of achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a series of latest instructions on fully playing the leading role of the working class and received representatives of the working class from various fronts across the country and the capital. Today, he approved the invitation of worker representatives from various places to come to Beijing to observe the celebrations. This is the greatest trust, greatest care, and greatest encouragement from the great leader Chairman Mao to the working class across the country. Chairman Mao and the working class have a heart-to-heart connection. The marching workers carried giant banners reading "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" "The working class is forever loyal to Chairman Mao!" fully expressing their resolve to be forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

With the deepening of struggle, criticism, and reform, the situation on the industrial front in the capital is getting better and better. The marching workers drove giant floats, reporting to the great leader Chairman Mao their bountiful achievements in seizing revolution and promoting production.

The most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—carried a giant banner reading "Long live the people's communes!" bringing their great achievements in revolutionary production and participating in the celebratory parade. In the marching ranks composed of poor and lower-middle peasants from 13 counties (districts) in the suburbs of Beijing, a giant portrait of Chairman Mao stood tall. Around the portrait of Chairman Mao, five golden sunflowers bloomed facing the sun. The poor and lower-middle peasants consciously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and his series of latest instructions, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism, earnestly carrying out struggle, criticism, and reform, and achieving one victory after another. The giant signboard held high by the marching ranks reading "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture" fully demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. When their marching ranks passed through Tiananmen Square, people cheered: "Salute to the poor and lower-middle peasants!"

Representatives from the front lines of the country's border defense and coastal defense, as well as the "three supports, two militaries" first line, participated in today's parade. With hearts full of boundless joy, they accepted the inspection of the great commander Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and is always the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the faithful defender of the socialist motherland. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great order to "support the leftist broad masses" and made great contributions in the "three supports, two militaries" work. Today, they again, as the strong backbone of the working class, created new achievements on the political stage of struggle, criticism, and reform in the domain of the superstructure. Tiananmen Square resonated with slogans: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army!" "Salute to the People's Liberation Army!" "We must liberate Taiwan!" "Firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the anti-American national salvation war to the end!" Fully armed militia also participated in the parade.

Red Guards and revolutionary students waved red classics, vigorously marching through Tiananmen Square. Together with the workers, PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in schools, they drove floats showcasing the achievements and resolutions of the Red Guards to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, accepting Chairman Mao's inspection. The Red Guards expressed their determination to firmly follow the leadership of the working class, accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and walk the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers for life.

Cadres from various departments and revolutionary residents today also participated in the celebratory parade, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations.

When revolutionary cultural workers dressed in workers', peasants', and soldiers' uniforms carried giant placards and models reading "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art!" "*Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*," and "*Minutes of the Conference on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Jiang Qing on Behalf of Comrade Lin Biao*," they marched through Tiananmen Square with renewed spirit. The entire audience was in high spirits. The eight revolutionary model operas—revolutionary modern Beijing operas *The Red Lantern*, *The White-Haired Girl*, *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*, *On the Dock*, and *Shajiabang*, revolutionary ballet *The Red Detachment of Women*, revolutionary symphony *Shajiabang*, and new proletarian literary and artistic forms such as piano accompaniment *The Red Lantern*—created by Comrade Jiang Qing, who personally led their cultivation, entered the square on large floats. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, the great victory of Chairman Mao's policy of "ancient for modern use, foreign for Chinese use" and "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend"! Revolutionary cultural workers who have undergone tempering and testing in more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, on this festive day of celebrating National Day, expressed their loyalty to Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will definitely follow your words, walk the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, forever be small students of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and consciously accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The giant placard reading "Develop sports, enhance the people's physique" led the sports army forward with high spirits. The ranks featured a giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze River. The athletes waved blue ribbons, forming rolling waves, symbolizing the 700 million people of our country following the great commander Chairman Mao, bravely advancing in the great waves of class struggle.

The Albanian comrades from the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist front, the Vietnamese and Lao comrades from the front lines of the anti-American national salvation war, international friends from the five continents, and friends from Pakistan received enthusiastic welcome from the parade participants. The parade participants continuously shouted: "Resolutely smash the conspiracy of U.S.-Soviet collusion to divide the world!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the reactionaries of various countries that follow U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism!" "Firmly support the heroic Albanian people in withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact!" "Firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying out the great anti-American national salvation war to the end!" "Firmly support the Pakistani people in resisting foreign aggression! Firmly support the self-determination rights of the Kashmiri people!" "Salute to the true Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations of various countries!" "Salute to the fighters against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism!" "Salute to the revolutionaries who oppose all foreign interference!"

    来自祖国边防、海防前哨以及“三支”“两军”第一线的解放军代表参加了今天的游行。他们怀着无限幸福的心情，接受伟大统帅毛主席和林副主席的检阅。用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的中国人民解放军无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远是无产阶级专政的柱石，是社会主义祖国的忠实保卫者。广大指战员坚决执行毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号令，在“三支”“两军”工作中作出了巨大贡献。今天，他们又作为工人阶级的坚强后盾，在领导上层建筑领域斗、批、改的政治舞台上创建新功。天安门广场响起一阵阵“向中国人民解放军学习！”“向中国人民解放军致敬！”“我们一定要解放台湾！”“坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！”的口号声。参加游行的还有全副武装的民兵。
    红卫兵小将和革命师生挥动着红色宝书，生气勃勃地通过天安门广场。他们和驻校工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队一起，开着表现红卫兵战绩和红卫兵决心与工农兵相结合的彩车，接受毛主席的检阅。红卫兵小将表示，坚决服从工人阶级领导，接受工农兵的再教育，一辈子走与工农兵相结合的道路。

    当身穿工农兵服装的革命文艺战士抬着“毛主席革命文艺路线胜利万岁！”《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》等巨型标语牌和模型，精神焕发地通过天安门广场时，全场一片欢腾。江青同志亲自领导培育的八个革命样板戏——革命现代京剧《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》，革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》和无产阶级文艺新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》等革命文艺中塑造的工农兵高大艺术形象，巍然屹立在大型彩车上进入广场。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是毛主席“古为今用，洋为中用”“百花齐放，推陈出新”方针的伟大胜利！在两年多的无产阶级文化大革命中经受锻炼和考验的广大革命文艺战士，在欢庆国庆盛大节日的时候，向毛主席表忠心：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定听您的话，走和工农兵相结合的道路，一辈子为工农兵服务，永远做工农兵的小学生，自觉地接受工农兵的再教育。
    “发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的巨幅标语牌，引导着体育大军精神抖擞地奋勇前进。队伍中出现了伟大领袖毛主席畅游长江的巨幅画像，体育健儿们挥舞着蓝色彩绸，组成了滚滚的波涛，象征着我国七亿人民紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进。
    参加观礼的来自反帝反修前线的阿尔巴尼亚战友、来自抗美救国战争前线的越南和老挝战友和来自五大洲的国际友人、来自巴基斯坦的朋友，受到了游行群众的热烈欢迎。游行群众不断高呼：“坚决粉碎美苏勾结瓜分世界的阴谋！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒追随美帝、苏修的各国反动派！”“坚决支持英雄的阿尔巴尼亚退出华沙条约！”“坚决支持英雄的越南人民把伟大的抗美救国战争进行到底！”“坚决支持巴基斯坦人民反对外来侵略！坚决支持克什米尔人民的自决权利！”“向各国真正的马克思列宁主义政党和团体致敬！”“向反对美帝、反对苏修的战士致敬！”“向反对一切外来干涉的革命的民族主义者致敬！”
