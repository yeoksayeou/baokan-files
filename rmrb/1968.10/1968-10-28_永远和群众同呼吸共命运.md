Title: Forever Breathing with the Masses and Sharing Their Destiny

I am a loader, who joined the Party and became a cadre under the cultivation of the Party and Chairman Mao. A capitalist roader in our station once told me, "Now that you're an official, it's not the same as when you used to carry the iron shovel. A cadre's responsibility is to control the masses and sit in the office." Due to my relaxed vigilance, I gradually fell for the "theory of the backwardness of the masses" propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev, forgetting my old trade. I participated less in physical labor, started to act like an official, and ignored the masses' initiatives and criticisms. Unknowingly, the distance between me and the masses grew wider. This rectification movement deeply touched my soul. I studied Chairman Mao's teachings over and over again: "What distinguishes our Party from all other political parties is that it is not concerned with the welfare of any one individual or any one group, but with the welfare of the whole people." I realized that it was the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev that separated me from the masses. The Chinese Khrushchev smears the masses to disrupt the relationship between the Party and the people, making Party members unconsciously degenerate and become lords above the people, becoming tools for his capitalist restoration.

Whether one can closely connect with the masses and forever be a student of the masses is a distinguishing feature of the Communist Party and a test for Party members. Communist Party members are the advanced elements of the proletariat and the trusted friends of the broad masses. Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings, humbly being a student of the masses, and blending with the masses can one continuously progress. The Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to corrupt our broad Party members with the poison of the "theory of the backwardness of the masses" is utterly futile!

During this rectification movement, I, together with the broad Party members, severely criticized the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, tore down the high wall that separated Party members from the masses, and liberated myself from the bureaucratic mansion of "upstairs and downstairs, sofa and telephone." I re-entered the workshops, worked alongside the workers, and humbly learned from the masses. For a period, the loading tasks in the loading shed were heavy, and the workers all generously said, "We'll take on these tasks. We'll spare no effort to shoulder the burden of carrying the revolution and promoting production." Thus, everyone voluntarily gave up rest time to load and unload more. I worked from morning to night, never leaving the cargo site, never letting go of the shovel, never forgetting the masses, and fought alongside everyone. As a result, the loading tasks broke the highest record since the Cultural Revolution and even pioneered a way to increase "static loading," bringing more income to the state.

These vivid facts gave the "theory of the backwardness of the masses" propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev a resounding slap in the face!

    永远和群众同呼吸共命运
    苏州站老工人  殷长清
    我是一个装卸工人，在党和毛主席的培养下入了党，当了干部。我们站上的一个走资派曾经对我说：“当官了，可不比以前背铁锹的时候了。干部的责任就是对群众要管得住，办公室要坐得住。”由于思想放松了警惕，我慢慢地中了中国赫鲁晓夫
  “群众落后论”的毒，忘了老本行。参加体力劳动少了，摆起官架子来了，群众的积极性看不见了，群众的批评听不进了。不知不觉中，和群众的距离就越来越远。这次整党运动，深深触动了我的灵魂，我一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的亲切教导：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。”使我认识到是中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论把我和群众隔了开来。中国赫鲁晓夫拚命往群众脸上抹灰，就是为了破坏党群关系，使党员不知不觉地蜕化变质，成为高踞于群众头上的老爷，成为他复辟资本主义的工具。
    能不能紧密联系群众，能不能永远当群众的小学生，是共产党区别于其他政党的标志之一，是考验党员的试金石。共产党员是无产阶级的先进分子，是广大群众的贴心人。只有遵照毛主席的教导，老老实实甘当群众的小学生，同群众打成一片，才能使自己不断前进。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想用
  “群众落后论”这付毒药腐蚀我们广大党员，一万个办不到！
    在这次整党运动中，我和广大党员一起，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论，推倒了那堵把党员和群众分离开来的高墙，把自己从“楼上楼下，沙发电话”的官僚主义小楼里解放了出来。我重新深入班组，和工人一起摸爬滚打，虚心向群众学习。有一段时间，装卸车间任务重，工人们都豪爽地说：“这些任务我们包下来了，拚着老命也要把抓革命、促生产的担子挑起来。”就这样，大家主动放弃休息时间，多装多卸。我也从早到夜，身不离货场，手不离铁锹，心不离群众，和大家一起奋战。结果，装卸任务突破了文化大革命以来的最高纪录，并且还闯出了一条提高“静载重”的路子，为国家增加了收入。
    这些活生生的事实，给了中国赫鲁晓夫“群众落后论”一记响亮的耳光！
