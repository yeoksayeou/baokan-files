More than ten thousand people in Tokyo held anti-American rallies and demonstrations. The demonstrators smashed a police station in anger, bravely fought back against police suppression, and fought so fiercely that the police were unable to withstand the assault and fled in disarray.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on October 9, the East Asia Press reported that workers and students in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and other places held meetings and demonstrations on October 8 to commemorate the struggle one year ago at Haneda Airport in Tokyo against Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku's trip to Saigon. They also mourned the university student Yamazaki Hiroshi, who bravely sacrificed his life in this struggle.

In Tokyo, more than ten thousand workers, farmers, students, and citizens from the city and surrounding counties gathered in Hibiya Park for a meeting to mourn Yamazaki Hiroshi and to express their determination to more forcefully carry out the struggle to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The platform at the meeting site was adorned with a portrait of the deceased Yamazaki and banners reading "Smash the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,'" "Dismantle U.S. Military Bases," and "Block the Transport of U.S. Military Supplies."

A representative of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) read aloud Chairman Mao's teachings at the meeting: "All the people of the world, unite! Drive out the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! All the people of the world, be courageous, dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All the ghosts and monsters will be routed."

A representative of Japanese university students, who are steadfastly fighting against the reactionary education system, emphasized in his speech that the struggle of the broad masses of students on university campuses has already merged with the struggle of workers, peasants, youth, and students across the country to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and dismantle U.S. military bases. "We are determined to most resolutely join forces with the Mexican students who are bravely fighting and to further ignite a powerful revolutionary storm that sweeps across the entire world."

The struggle declaration adopted at the meeting stated: "In the past year, the struggle of the Japanese people has merged with the anti-American struggles of the peoples of all countries around the world and has developed into a powerful movement. Our struggle, together with the struggle of black people in the United States, workers and students in France, and the anti-American struggles in Latin America, has put U.S. imperialism in an unprecedented predicament."

The meeting ended with the singing of "The Internationale."

After the meeting, the crowd, prepared to counter police suppression and wearing helmets, marched to Tokyo's Shinjuku Station to block the transport of jet fuel for U.S. military aircraft. Meanwhile, workers and students who held meetings in other parts of Tokyo also rushed to Shinjuku Station. Several groups merged into one, carrying out a brave struggle.

Around ten o'clock in the evening, the Japanese reactionary government sent a thousand armed police to brutally suppress the demonstrators at Shinjuku Station, using batons to beat the crowd, injuring more than five hundred people and arresting one hundred and forty.

Enraged by the armed police's suppression, the demonstrators threw stones to resist, repeatedly repelling the police's attacks. The crowds packed onto the platforms condemned the reactionary forces' frenzied suppression and shouted in unison, "Police, get out!" The demonstrators held up hundreds of red flags and flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Some of the red flags read, "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" They marched through the bustling streets, shouting anti-American slogans, and built barricades at every major intersection with wood to defend against police attacks.

The demonstrators smashed the police station in front of Shinjuku Station. Thousands of nearby residents cheered in support.

More than a thousand police launched another attack on the demonstrators, even targeting the elderly and women. The demonstrators and the people together fiercely counterattacked with stones dug up from the sidewalks, surrounding the police and engaging in close combat. They fought so fiercely that the police were unable to withstand the assault and fled in disarray.

In Osaka, more than three thousand workers, students, and citizens held a meeting and demonstration at Otemachi Park.

A student spoke at the meeting, saying, "Yamazaki Hiroshi sacrificed his life bravely for the people in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' and the demand to dismantle U.S. military bases. We must advance bravely and forever remember him." When he spoke of Yamazaki Hiroshi's brave sacrifice, all the attendees shouted slogans: "Advance along the path of Yamazaki's blood!" "Smash the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty!" "Dismantle U.S. Military Bases!" "Return Okinawa!" After the meeting, the youth and students marched in high spirits.

In Kyoto, about two thousand young workers and students held a meeting in Sonzan Park on the evening of October 8. The meeting unanimously affirmed the importance of the current struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and expressed their determination to carry on Yamazaki Hiroshi's legacy and continue the struggle.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on October 8, the East Asia Press reported: On October 6, workers, farmers, and students in Tokyo, Osaka, Saitama, Fukuoka, and other places simultaneously held anti-American meetings and demonstrations, demanding the withdrawal of all U.S. military bases in Japan and the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

In Tokyo, about a thousand workers, farmers, and students held a meeting at the site where the U.S. is preparing to expand the Tachikawa Air Base, and then held a brave demonstration in the commercial center near the base after the meeting.

A worker read aloud Chairman Mao's inscription to Japanese workers: "As long as we seriously achieve the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt." He said, we must seriously study this inscription, arm ourselves resolutely with Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for the final victory of the struggle. After the meeting, workers and students, with red flags reading "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" at the forefront, held a brave demonstration around the base and called on citizens to jointly struggle for the withdrawal of U.S. military bases.

    纪念羽田斗争一周年　沿着烈士血迹继续前进　粉碎日美“安全条约”
    东京一万多群众举行反美集会和示威
    示威群众怒砸警察所，英勇反击警察镇压，打得警察无法招架，狼狈逃走
    据新华社九日讯　据东方通讯社报道，日本东京、大阪、京都等地的工人和学生，八日分别举行集会和示威游行，纪念去年在东京羽田机场反对日本首相佐藤荣作去西贡活动的斗争一周年。他们还追悼在这场斗争中英勇牺牲的大学生山崎博昭。
    在东京，来自市内和邻近各县的工人、农民、学生和市民一万多人，聚集在日比谷公园举行大会，追悼山崎博昭，同时表示要更有力地开展粉碎日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    会场的讲台上挂着死者山崎的画像和“粉碎日美‘安全条约’”、“拆除美国军事基地”、“阻止运输美国军需品”等标语。
    日中友好协会（正统）的代表在会上讲话时，高声朗读毛主席的教导：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    正在为反对反动的教育制度而坚持斗争的日本大学学生代表在讲话中强调说，广大学生群众在大学校园里开展的斗争，已经同在全国蓬勃兴起的工人、农民、青年和学生争取粉碎日美“安全条约”和拆除美国军事基地的斗争结合起来。“我们决心最坚决地同正在英勇地进行斗争的墨西哥学生同心协力，进一步掀起席卷全世界的强大革命风暴。”
    会上通过的斗争宣言说：“在过去一年中，日本人民的斗争同全世界各国人民的反美斗争结合在一起，有了声势浩大的发展。我们的斗争，同美国黑人的斗争、法国工人和学生的斗争以及拉丁美洲的反美斗争互相支持，已使美帝国主义陷入了前所未有的困境。”
    集会在《国际歌》声中结束。
    会后，头戴钢盔、准备反击警察镇压的群众，前往东京的新宿车站，进行阻止运输美军喷气式飞机燃料的斗争。同时在东京其他几个地方举行集会的工人和学生，也赶到新宿车站。几支队伍汇合在一起，开展了英勇的斗争。
    晚上大约十点钟，日本反动政府派了一千名武装警察，残暴地镇压新宿车站范围内的示威者，使用警棍殴打群众，打伤五百多人，逮捕了一百四十多人。
    对武装警察的镇压十分愤怒的示威者，投掷石块来进行抵抗，一再打退警察的进攻。挤满月台的人民群众谴责反动势力的疯狂镇压，同声高呼：“警察滚回去！”示威者举着几百面红旗和越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，有的红旗上写着：“毛泽东思想万岁！”他们在繁华的街道上游行，高呼反美口号，并在街上的每个主要地点用木头筑起街垒，防备警察的袭击。
    示威者砸坏了新宿车站前的警察所。附近的几千名群众热烈鼓掌表示支持。
    一千多名警察再一次袭击示威者，连老人和妇女也不放过。示威者和人民群众一起用从人行道上挖出来的石头猛烈地还击，包围了警察，同他们进行短兵相接的搏斗，打得警察无法招架，狼狈逃走。
    在大阪，工人、学生和市民三千多人在扇町公园举行了集会和示威游行。
    一位学生在会上发表讲话说：“山崎博昭是在反对日美‘安全条约’和要求拆除美国军事基地的斗争中为人民的利益而英勇牺牲的。我们必须奋勇前进，永远纪念他。”当他谈到山崎博昭的英勇牺牲时，全体与会者高呼口号：“让我们沿着山崎烈士的血迹继续前进！”“粉碎日美安全条约！”“拆除美国军事基地！”“归还冲绳！”会后，青年和学生斗志昂扬地举行了示威游行。游行队伍到达闹市后，同佐藤反动政府派出的两千多名武装警察展开了激烈的搏斗。
    在京都，大约两千名青年工人和学生八日晚上在园山公园举行集会。会议一致确认当前反对日美“安全条约”的斗争具有重要意义，并表示决心继承山崎博昭的遗志，继续进行斗争。
    据新华社八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本工人、农民和学生六日在东京、大阪、埼玉、福冈等地同时举行反美集会和示威游行，要求撤除在日本的全部美国军事基地和废除日美“安全条约”。
    在东京，大约一千名工人、农民和学生在美国准备扩建立川空军基地的地方举行集会，会后在基地附近的商业中心举行了英勇的示威游行。
    一位工人在会上朗读了毛主席给日本工人朋友们的题词“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”他说，我们必须认真学习这一题词，让我们坚决地用毛泽东思想武装自己，争取斗争的最后胜利。会后，工人和学生以写着“毛泽东思想万岁”的红旗为前导，在基地周围举行了英勇的示威，并呼吁市民共同为撤除美军基地而斗争。
