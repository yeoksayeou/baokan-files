After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Jianyan County, Sichuan Province in February this year, three rounds of organizational streamlining and personnel reduction were carried out. In the process of implementing the policy of streamlining administration and reducing personnel, they not only focused on reducing the number of people, but also paid special attention to the quality of the personnel, making the streamlined new organizations better able to play a leading role.

At the beginning of implementing the policy of streamlining administration and reducing personnel, Jianyan County Revolutionary Committee only focused on abolishing organizations and reducing personnel, but did not pay enough attention to the ideological transformation of the people. After the streamlining, it was soon found that the ideological style and work methods of some comrades did not adapt to the new situation and new tasks. In response to this situation, everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," realizing that "streamlining administration" must be accompanied by "strengthening the army." The army must not only be small in number but also "strong in quality." Only by building a revolutionary, mass-linked, and elite team can one adapt to the new situation where work is busy, personnel are few, tasks are heavy, and requirements are high.

Do not be a "peace officer," and thoroughly carry out the revolution

From then on, the Jianyan County Revolutionary Committee put the ideological transformation of the people in the first place. They found that some people had the following active thoughts:

1. They sought stability, were accustomed to handling matters according to routine, and could not get rid of the old method of relying on meetings and reports to guide work.
2. They craved comfort, feared hardship, tension, and heavy responsibilities.
3. They feared making mistakes, worried that new and old accounts would be settled together, and thought it was safer to be a "peace officer."

The military representatives and the People's Liberation Army leftist personnel participating in the Revolutionary Committee analyzed and studied these active thoughts, believing that the idea of being content with the status quo and being a "peace officer" came from the "self" in people's minds, which was the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev in the construction of political power. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "Grasp ideological education, which is the central link for uniting the whole party to carry out great political struggles," and organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's brilliant expositions on class struggle, and severely criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power. At the same time, the Revolutionary Committee also often invited poor and lower-middle peasants to the office to give class education, provide suggestions to the Revolutionary Committee, carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and conduct small rectification movements. The Revolutionary Committee also organized office workers to go to the grassroots level to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, discuss and criticize self and revisionism with them, greatly improving the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the members of the Revolutionary Committee. They expressed their determination to fight to the end with their old ideas and habits.

Commissioner He Shaoping, who is in charge of agricultural production, was afraid of making mistakes again after the streamlining of administration and personnel, and dared not lead. In March and April this year, the whole county was hit by a cold wave, and some production teams had the phenomenon of rotten seeds and rotten rice seedlings. He did not dare to give advice or find solutions. After learning about his concerns, Revolutionary Committee Chairman and military representative Lu Zhendong took him to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on daring to struggle, being good at struggling, and daring to carry out self-criticism, making him realize that being afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind, not daring to work actively for the people's interests, is a serious mistake. Thus, he put down his mental burden, carrying the revolutionary classics to Changhe Commune, propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the poor and lower-middle peasants, arousing the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and actively replanting rice seeds. He also organized some production teams to exchange seeds with each other, and the problem was quickly solved.

The ideological transformation made the members of the Revolutionary Committee change the previous situation of passing things up and down, and the work efficiency was greatly improved. The masses praised, "You have fewer people but do more things, and you are indeed good servants of the people!"

Hold the steering wheel firmly and never forget the lifeline

When the Revolutionary Committee was first established, some members were still busy with grain, cotton, and oil, neglecting class struggle and mass ideology to some extent.

Under the help of the People's Liberation Army leftist personnel, the Revolutionary Committee checked this phenomenon of not highlighting proletarian politics, seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and everyone realized that highlighting proletarian politics is the fundamental direction of the Revolutionary Committee, and political work is the lifeline of all work. The more the tasks are heavy and the situation is complex, the more we must firmly walk the road of highlighting proletarian politics. From then on, the leading members of the Revolutionary Committee went to the most difficult working areas and the most complex class struggle areas, armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and grasped class struggle.

Soon after the establishment of the Ma Tuo District Revolutionary Committee, the class enemies launched a rightist reversal black wind, some units that had achieved revolutionary great unity were in chaos, and some deceived masses left their production posts, seriously affecting production. Some people saw this situation and thought that it was most important to get production going, suggesting taking measures to urgently improve production; some advocated immediately sending office workers to the units with problems to take charge there. The standing committee members of the County Revolutionary Committee collectively studied this problem and believed that these were methods that did not highlight proletarian politics. County Revolutionary Committee Chairman and military representative Lu Zhendong, carrying the revolutionary classics, rushed to Ma Tuo District overnight. He patiently told everyone, "The more it is at this time, the more we must highlight proletarian politics. As long as we grasp this link, everything will be well, and production and other work will be well done." After the direction was clarified, Lu Zhendong and the members of the District Revolutionary Committee went to the front line of struggle together, armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and launched a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and the hidden class enemies. Towns, villages, schools, and offices were all battlefields for revolutionary criticism. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes became fighting groups to attack class enemies. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants severely criticized China's Khrushchev's spreading of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and "production first" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, exposing the counter-revolutionary crimes of a handful of class enemies in opposing the party, opposing socialism, and sabotaging the newly born Revolutionary Committee. The poor and lower-middle peasants were in high spirits, their revolutionary spirit was greatly encouraged, and their labor enthusiasm was high. People said: The Revolutionary Committee grasps the revolution and promotes production, which is different from the old organization. We must support the Revolutionary Committee with practical actions.

Everyone saw the power of highlighting politics from the solution of the Ma Tuo District problem. However, a few people with deep-rooted old ideas and habits thought that there were too many things and too few people, and they could not go down to grasp class struggle, fearing that going down to grasp class struggle would affect the work of their own division. The leading members of the Revolutionary Committee actively did ideological work, helped these comrades solve their ideological problems, went deep into the grassroots level, and let everyone correct their understanding and create experience in practice.

Revolutionary Committee member Huang Jiyang is in charge of cultural and educational work. At first, he spent the whole day in the office using the telephone to "grasp" the situation, doing statistics, reports, and receiving visiting masses, and was overwhelmed. The masses raised some difficult questions that he could not answer. The Revolutionary Committee called on everyone to go deep into the grassroots level and highlight politics, but he could not understand it. He thought that he was busy all day, could not eat well, and could not sleep well, so where would he have time to go to the grassroots level. Later, with the help of the Revolutionary Committee, he and another office worker went to a few communes. They started from grasping class struggle, carried out revolutionary criticism with the masses there, and also conducted a special investigation on cultural and educational issues with the revolutionary teachers and students of the schools, formulated solutions to these problems, and guided the whole county with it, solving some difficult problems in cultural and educational work.

In highlighting proletarian politics, the Jianyan County Revolutionary Committee also paid special attention to grasping the typical examples that embody the socialist direction and using them to lead the general situation.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army agricultural support personnel, the Mangjiang Brigade of Ma Tuo Commune held struggle meetings to criticize self and revisionism in every household, and every courtyard held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. The enthusiasm of the commune members was high, and the production was full of energy. The leading members of the County Revolutionary Committee first led the county, district, and commune Revolutionary Committee members and office workers to this brigade to hold a study class, learning the experience of this brigade in highlighting politics and grasping class struggle, and using it as a mirror to change their own work style. At the same time, they helped this brigade to summarize the experience of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, as a typical example to be publicized and promoted throughout the county. Following this, various people's communes and production teams organized the masses to go for a visit and learn. In a short period, the whole county's rural areas launched a wave of grasping the fundamentals, highlighting politics, and learning, comparing, and catching up with the Mangjiang Brigade.

Jiyi Commune was originally a "point" of the old county committee. In the past, the old county committee often sent work teams of thirty or forty people here to peddle China's Khrushchev's black goods such as "production first" and "material incentives," resulting in it becoming an old backward commune, and every year it had to borrow grain, loans, and fertilizer from the state. The Revolutionary Committee organized them to visit and learn from the Mangjiang Brigade. And referring to the experience of the Mangjiang Brigade, they assisted various production teams to set up good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out revolutionary criticism, eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev, and further arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the commune members. This year, when this commune encountered a spring famine, the commune members helped each other and overcame the difficulties through self-reliance. Both revolution and production have leaped forward. Like this commune, the whole county, through the activity of learning, comparing, and catching up with the advanced typical examples, the spiritual face of the commune members has undergone a great change. In the past, every year, part of the poor communes and teams had to borrow loans and grain. This year, these communes and teams all overcame the difficulties through self-reliance. The grain, loans, and chemical fertilizers allocated by the state in advance were not borrowed out at all.

The Revolutionary Committee regards the method of grasping typical examples and leading the general situation as a powerful measure to highlight proletarian politics, overcome the difficulties of many people and few things, and ensure high-quality work. Now, the county, district, and commune are learning and catching up with "Dazhai" while also having local typical examples of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, working hard and self-reliant development of production, and cleaning up the class ranks combined with revolutionary criticism. The Revolutionary Committee relies on these typical examples to push the work of the whole county forward victoriously.

    政要简，兵要精
    四川省井研县革委会精简机构以后，狠抓领导班子的思想革命化，紧密联系群众，克服了事多人少的困难，有力地推动了全县革命生产向前发展
    本报讯　四川省井研县今年二月成立革命委员会后，接连三次压缩机构，精简人员。他们在实行精兵简政的过程中，不仅注意人员的“简”，尤其注意人员的“精”，使精简后的新机构更好地发挥领导作用。
    井研县革委会在开始实行精兵简政的时候，只侧重于撤机构、减人员，对人的思想革命化抓得不够。精简后很快就发现有些同志的思想作风、工作方法和新形势、新任务不相适应。针对这种情况，大家又反复学习了毛主席关于“精兵简政”的指示，认识到“简政”必须“精兵”。精兵不仅要求兵少，而且要求“兵精”。只有建立一支革命化的、联系群众的、精悍的队伍，才能适应工作忙，人员少，任务重，要求高的新形势。
    不当“和平官”，彻底闹革命
    从此，井研县革委会就把抓好人的思想革命化放在首要地位。他们发现有一部分人存在以下活思想：
    一是求稳，习惯于按照常规办事，摆脱不了过去靠开会、听汇报指导工作的老办法。
    二是贪图安逸，怕艰苦、怕紧张、怕挑重担子。
    三是怕字当头，担心犯了错误，新账、老账一起算，不如当个“和平官”保险些。
    参加革委会的军队代表和解放军支左人员对这些活思想作了分析研究，认为安于现状、当“和平官”的思想，来源于人们头脑中资产阶级的“私”字，是中了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设上推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒。他们遵循毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，组织大家学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的光辉论述，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设上的反革命修正主义路线。与此同时，革委会还经常请贫下中农到机关来上阶级教育课，给革委会提意见，开展斗私批修活动，进行小整风。革委会还组织办事人员带着问题到基层去拜贫下中农为师，和贫下中农同商量，同斗私批修，大大提高了革委会成员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。他们表示，要和自己的旧观念、旧习惯斗争到底。
    分工抓农业生产的常委何绍卿，精兵简政后，怕再犯错误，束手束脚，不敢领导。今年三四月间，全县遭到寒潮袭击，一些生产队出现烂种籽、烂稻秧的现象，他不敢出主意，想办法。革委会主任、军队代表路振东了解到他的顾虑后，就和他一道带着问题学习“老三篇”，学习毛主席关于要敢于斗争、善于斗争和勇于进行自我批评的教导，使他认识到：前怕狼，后怕虎，不敢为人民的利益而积极工作，是十分错误的。于是，他甩掉了思想包袱，怀揣着革命宝书到长河公社，向贫下中农宣传毛泽东思想，激发了群众的革命精神，积极补撒稻种。他还组织一些生产队相互调济种籽，使问题很快得到了解决。
    思想革命化使革委会人员改变了过去遇事上转、下传的状况，工作效率大大提高。群众赞扬说：“你们人少事情办得多，算得上人民的好勤务员！”
    握紧方向盘　不忘生命线
    革委会刚成立时，有的成员仍然象过去一样忙于抓粮棉油，对阶级斗争、对群众思想则有些忽视。
    县革委会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，检查了这种不突出无产阶级政治的现象，认真学习了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，大家认识到：突出无产阶级政治是革命委员会的根本方向，政治工作是一切工作的生命线，越是任务繁重，情况复杂，越要坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路。从此，革委会领导人员就到工作最艰苦，阶级斗争最复杂的地区，用毛泽东思想武装群众，狠抓阶级斗争。
    马沓区革委会成立不久，阶级敌人就掀起了一股右倾翻案黑风，一些已实现革命大联合的单位在闹分裂，一些受蒙蔽的群众脱离生产岗位，生产受到严重影响。有的人看到这种情况，认为把生产搞上去最要紧，建议采取措施突击搞好生产；有的主张立即派办事人员到出了问题的单位，把那里管起来。县革委会的常委们集体研究了这个问题，认为这些是不突出无产阶级政治的作法。县革委会主任、军队代表路振东身带革命宝书连夜赶到了马沓区，他针对部分区、社干部的焦急心情，耐心地对大家说：“越是这个时候，越要突出无产阶级政治。只要抓住了这一环，一通百通，生产和其他工作都会搞好。”方向明确后，路振东和区革委会成员一起到斗争第一线，用毛泽东思想武装群众，向中国赫鲁晓夫和暗藏的阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻。区镇、院坝、学校、机关，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，变成了向阶级敌人进攻的战斗组。广大贫下中农狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散播的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“生产第一”等反革命修正主义谬论，揭发了一小撮阶级敌人反党反社会主义和破坏新生的革命委员会的反革命罪行。贫下中农心情舒畅，革命精神大大发扬，劳动热情高涨。人们说：革委会抓革命、促生产，和旧机构就是不同，我们一定要用实际行动支持革命委员会。
    大家从马沓区问题的解决中看到了突出政治的威力。可是少数旧观念、旧习惯较深的人，觉得人少事多，下不去，害怕下去抓阶级斗争会影响做好自己分管的业务。革委会领导成员积极做好思想工作，帮助这些同志解决思想问题，深入到基层，让大家在实践中端正认识，创造经验。
    革委会委员黄吉洋负责抓文教工作。最初他整天在机关里用电话“掌握”情况，搞统计、表报，接待来访群众，应接不暇。群众提出的一些疑难问题他又无法回答。革委会号召大家深入基层，突出政治，他想不通。认为自己成天忙得吃不好饭，睡不好觉，那还有时间下基层去。后来，在革委会的帮助下，他和另一个办事人员跑了几个公社，他们从抓阶级斗争入手，和那里群众一道开展革命大批判，还和学校的革命师生一道，作了文教问题的专题调查，制订了解决这些问题的方案，并以它指导全县，解决了文教工作中的一些疑难问题。
    抓典型带一般
    井研县革委会在突出无产阶级政治中，还特别注意抓住体现社会主义方向的典型，用以带动一般。
    马沓公社茫江大队在解放军支农人员的帮助下，家家户户都举办斗私批修讲用会，每个院落都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，社员们革命热情高涨，生产干劲十足。县革委会领导成员，先率领县、区、社革委会成员和办事人员来到这个大队开办学习班，学习这个大队突出政治，狠抓阶级斗争的经验，并以它为镜子，改变自己的工作作风。同时，又帮助这个大队，总结出活学活用毛泽东思想的经验，作为一个典型在全县宣传、推广。接着，各人民公社、生产队都组织群众前去参观、学习。短期内，全县农村就展开了狠抓根本，突出政治，学、比、赶茫江大队的热潮。
    集益公社原是旧县委的“点”，过去旧县委经常组成三、四十人的工作组在这里贩卖中国赫鲁晓夫“生产第一”、“物质刺激”等黑货，结果成了老落后社，每年都向国家贷粮、贷款、贷肥。革委会组织他们去茫江大队参观、学习。并参照茫江大队的经验，协助各生产队办好毛泽东思想学习班，开展革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，进一步激发了社员们的革命积极性。今年这个社遇到春荒，社员们互相帮助，自力更生战胜了困难，革命和生产都跃了上去。和这个公社一样，全县通过开展学、比、赶先进典型的活动，社员们的精神面貌有了极大的改变。过去，每年都要给部分困难社、队贷款、贷粮。今年，这些社、队都自力更生解决困难，国家预拨的粮、款和化肥，一半也未贷出去。
    县革委会把抓典型、带一般的方法，作为突出无产阶级政治，克服事多人少、保证工作高质量的有力措施。现在，县、区、社在学、赶“大寨”的同时，都树有本地的活学活用毛泽东思想的典型，艰苦奋斗、自力更生发展生产的典型，清理阶级队伍结合革命大批判的典型。革委会依靠这些典型，把全县工作胜利推向前进。
