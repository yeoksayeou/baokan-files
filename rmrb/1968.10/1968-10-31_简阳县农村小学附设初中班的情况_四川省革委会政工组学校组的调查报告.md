Chairman Mao teaches us: "Primary schools with attached junior high school classes, this method is still a good method, an advanced experience. It is convenient for the children of peasants to study nearby, and after graduation, they can return home to produce." Chairman Mao's instructions have touched the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. As early as 1958, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jianyang County in Sichuan Province, following the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, set up some junior high school classes in the primary schools of the people's communes. Later, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, under the pretext of "irregularity" and "low quality," used malicious methods such as "removing the cap" and "removing the boots" to completely strangle them. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary teachers and students in Jianyang County, have settled accounts with the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist educational line. Since the beginning of this year, they have successively set up 359 junior high school classes in 201 rural primary schools, enrolling nearly 18,000 students, which is eight times the number of junior high school enrollments at the beginning of the year. Now, junior high school classes are spread throughout the 106 communes in the county, and the children of poor and lower-middle peasants can generally attend school nearby.

Primary schools with attached junior high school classes are an urgent demand of the poor and lower-middle peasants

In the past, due to the frantic promotion of the revisionist educational line by the Chinese Khrushchev, ordinary middle schools were all set up in towns, detached from proletarian politics, detached from productive labor, and detached from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very dissatisfied with this and said: "Once you start middle school, you have to quit your job, and you have to make bedding and mosquito nets. At least a year's board and lodging fees plus pocket money will cost a hundred or two hundred yuan. Even if you are admitted, you can't afford to study!" "The school does not teach class struggle, is detached from labor, some students look down on agriculture after studying junior high school, look down on industry after studying senior high school, look down on everything after studying university, can't carry a shoulder pole, can't lift a hand. What use is such a book!" After studying Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the educational revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants actively advocated setting up junior high school classes in primary schools to popularize junior high school education.

The junior high school class attached to Guanghui Primary School is the earliest one in the county. In the early days of its establishment, some people said it was a "fake middle school, not elegant, and it would collapse if it were set up." The poor and lower-middle peasants responded sharply: "We like this kind of 'fake' middle school!" Some people said, "The higher authorities do not approve, and the students cannot get a graduation certificate." The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "This kind of middle school has been approved by Chairman Mao early on, who else needs to approve? We send our children to school to build a new socialist countryside, not to become officials, we don't need that graduation certificate!" The commune's congress of representatives (the commune revolutionary committee had not yet been established at that time) held four executive meetings to discuss the issue of setting up junior high school classes. At the same time, Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held in all production teams to organize revolutionary teachers and students with the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's instructions on the educational revolution together, and to jointly criticize the revisionist educational line. Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, they resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions and set up the junior high school classes.

Gaofeng Commune is a mountainous area, and the commune members live in three gullies, each more than ten li away from each other with difficult mountain roads. The commune originally planned to set up a junior high school class in the middle gully. After consulting with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they insisted on setting up three classes, and now each gully has set up a junior high school class.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses contain an immense socialist enthusiasm." "They are very enthusiastic about opening such schools and believe that such schools are truly theirs." "In a short time, tens of thousands of schools will emerge in the countryside of the whole province, not like the intellectuals and so-called 'educators,' who shout 'popularize education,' shout and shout, it is still an empty talk." The facts in Jianyang County once again fully prove that Chairman Mao's teachings are extremely wise and correct.

Primary schools with attached junior high school classes are a great revolution in rural education

Primary schools with attached junior high school classes are a new thing. From the beginning of setting up junior high school classes, the poor and lower-middle peasants have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, broken through the old educational system, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, closely combined with the practice of the three great revolutionary movements, and firmly walked the road of building schools with proletarian politics. The main features are:

1. Because it comes from the urgent demand of the poor and lower-middle peasants, all junior high school classes are set up under the active planning and direct management of the local poor and lower-middle peasants. From the establishment, enrollment, to the setting of courses, reform of textbooks, as well as the selection of teachers, school buildings, equipment, etc., all are solved by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The school is led by the educational revolution leadership group with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, and the poor and lower-middle peasants also participate in the school's revolutionary committee (or leadership group) and take on major leading positions.

2. Emphasize proletarian politics, put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place, and actively carry out the "three loyalties" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line among teachers and students. Establish the system of "early reporting," "late reporting," "daily reading," and "reporting meetings." Take class struggle as a main course, invite workers, peasants, and soldiers to talk about their family history, village history, and revolutionary struggle history, and actively organize teachers and students to participate in social class struggle.

3. Shorten the school system and simplify the curriculum. Primary school is shortened to five years, and junior high school is shortened to two years. Junior high school classes generally set up three courses: Mao Zedong Thought, mathematics, and industrial and agricultural production knowledge, and some set up basic courses in physics and chemistry separately.

4. Workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken the stage. Invite workers, peasants, and soldiers with practical experience to be teachers for studying, farming, and military affairs, and lead teachers and students to participate in production practice. Some even planted "experimental fields."

5. Thoroughly reform the enrollment system and abolish the examination method. Junior high school enrollment adopts the method of "recommendation by the production team, examination by the brigade, selection by the commune, and participation by teachers," directly giving the poor and lower-middle peasants the power to enroll students, ensuring the prominence of proletarian politics and the implementation of the Party's class line.

6. Reduce the burden on the poor and lower-middle peasants, which is very beneficial for the school to open its doors to the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Students study nearby, eat and live at home, work in the team, and only pay a few yuan in miscellaneous fees. The remuneration that students themselves earn from participating in collective labor is enough for their own food and use, and parents do not need to bear the burden.

7. Carry forward the spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, be self-reliant, strive hard, and run schools thriftily. Jianyang County set up hundreds of junior high school classes without asking the state for people or money. The teachers needed are selected from a group of educated youth and demobilized soldiers of worker and peasant origin who have undergone labor tempering, and their remuneration is borne by the collective of the commune and brigade; a group is squeezed out by shortening the school system and tightening the quota of the existing school; a group of commune and brigade cadres and workers, peasants, and soldiers take on part-time voluntary teaching positions. The classrooms and equipment needed are fully utilized from the existing ones, and some even squeeze out the offices to use as classrooms; some rely on teachers and students to build schools with their own hands.

A new type of peasant with socialist consciousness and culture is being cultivated in this new type of school

The junior high school students cultivated in this new type of school are quite different from those cultivated in old schools. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many students read for nine years and did not know what a landlord was or what a hired laborer was. Some, after reading to the age of sixteen or seventeen, only heard a report of the poor and lower-middle peasants' bitter memories of the past during the Four Cleanups, went to the city to read a few years of middle school, and looked down on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now, the junior high school classes read Chairman Mao's books every day, often have poor and lower-middle peasants come to teach class struggle courses, and criticize the bourgeoisie at any time. Students' class struggle awareness and awareness of the two-line struggle have generally improved, actively participate in the class struggle of the commune and brigade, and are enthusiastic about serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many students have become active elements in propagating Mao Zedong Thought and criticizing the bourgeoisie in the commune and brigade. Some students insist on broadcasting in the fields every day, and some students have learned barbering skills, bought scissors, and went to the fields to give free haircuts to the poor and lower-middle peasants, which is very popular with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the past, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants went to the city to read middle school, the more they read, the less they loved labor, the more they feared hardship, and the more they cared about food and clothing. Now, the junior high school students are both students and commune members, without the bad airs of "foreign students." In addition to participating in collective labor during busy farming seasons and holidays, they also participate in labor before and after school, and can do a shift of work (more than two hours). They go barefoot, wear straw shoes, and some even carry a manure basket on the way to school to pick up manure, and some also serve as the team's scorekeeper.

The poor and lower-middle peasants are very pleased with the junior high school classes they set up and the performance of the students, and enthusiastically praise: "Such schools emphasize proletarian politics, combine production and labor, do not detach from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the students trained will not forget their roots and can become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."

The junior high school classes attached to primary schools in rural areas of Jianyang County, although they have been set up for a short time, have already shown their superiority and vitality. Why can Jianyang County achieve such results in setting up junior high school classes in such a short time? The fundamental reason is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out a mass criticism of the revisionist educational line in political and ideological aspects, to ensure the direct management of the poor and lower-middle peasants over the school in organizational aspects, to break the monopoly of the bourgeois intellectuals, and to establish the superiority of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the school. With the power of the pen in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they can resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts and develop the socialist educational cause needed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants quickly, well, and economically.

    简阳县农村小学附设初中班的情况
    ——四川省革委会政工组学校组的调查报告
    毛主席教导我们：“小学校附设初中班，这种办法还是好办法，先进经验。农民子女就近上学方便，将来毕业以后，好回家生产。”毛主席的指示说到了贫下中农的心里。早在一九五八年，四川省简阳县的贫下中农就遵照伟大领袖毛主席的这一指示，在人民公社的小学校里办起了一些初中班。后来被党内一小撮走资派以所谓“不正规”、“质量低”等罪名，用“摘帽子”、“脱靴子”等恶毒手段，给全部扼杀了。这次无产阶级文化大革命中，简阳县的广大工农兵和革命师生，清算了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的罪恶，从今年年初起，先后在二百零一所农村小学办了三百五十九个初中班，招生近一万八千人，等于往年初中招生的八倍。现在初中班遍及全县一百零六个公社，贫下中农子女一般都能就近入学。
    小学附设初中班是贫下中农的迫切要求
    过去，由于中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂推行修正主义教育路线，一般中学都办在城镇，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离生产劳动，脱离贫下中农。贫下中农对此十分不满，他们说：“一读中学就要脱产，还要制铺盖蚊帐，一年伙食费加零用钱至少也得一两百元，考上了也读不起！”“学校不讲阶级，脱离劳动，有的学生读了初中看不起农业，读了高中看不起工业，读了大学看不起一切，肩不能挑，手不能提。这种书读出来有啥用！”
    广大贫下中农学习了毛主席关于教育革命的一系列指示以后，就积极倡导在小学附设初中班，普及初中教育。
    光辉公社小学附设初中班，是全县办得最早的一个。举办初期，有人说是“假中学，不洋气，办起来也要垮”。贫下中农针锋相对地回答说：“我们就是喜欢这样的‘假’中学！”有人说“上级不批准，学生拿不到毕业证书”。贫下中农说：“这样的中学，毛主席早就批准了，还要谁批准？我们送娃儿读书是为了建设社会主义新农村，不是为了做官，不要那个毕业证书！”公社农代会（当时还没有成立公社革委会）开了四次常委会讨论办初中班的问题，同时在各生产队普遍办毛泽东思想学习班，组织革命师生同贫下中农一起学习毛主席关于教育革命的指示，共同批判修正主义教育路线。经过革命大批判，他们坚决落实毛主席的指示，把初中班办起来了。
    高峰公社是个山区，社员分住在三条沟，相距都有上十里难走的山路。公社原打算在中间那条沟办一个初中班，找贫下中农一商量，要求非办三个班不可，现在每条沟都办起了初中班。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”“他们非常热心开办这种学校，认为这样的学校才是他们自己的。”“不久的时间内，全省当有几万所学校在乡村中涌出来，不若知识阶级和所谓‘教育家’者流，空唤‘普及教育’，唤来唤去还是一句废话。”简阳县的事实再一次充分证明毛主席的教导无比英明、正确。
    小学附设初中班是农村教育的一场大革命
    小学附设初中班是一个新生事物。贫下中农从一开始举办初中班，就高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，冲破旧教育制度的框框，坚决执行毛主席的“五·七”指示，紧密结合三大革命运动的实践，坚定地走无产阶级政治建校的道路，使初中班完全以崭新的面貌出现。其主要特点是：
    一、由于出自贫下中农的迫切要求，所有初中班都是在当地贫下中农的积极策划和直接管理下办起来的。从兴办、招生，到课程设置、教材改革，以及教员、校舍、设备等问题，都由贫下中农作主来解决。学校由以贫下中农为主体的教育革命领导小组来领导，贫下中农还参加学校的革委会（或领导小组），担负主要领导职务。
    二、突出无产阶级政治，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位，在师生中积极开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，建立了“早请示”、“晚汇报”、“天天读”、“讲用会”制度。把阶级斗争作为一门主课，请工农兵讲家史、村史、革命斗争史，并积极组织师生参加社会阶级斗争。
    三、缩短了学制，精简了课程。小学缩短为五年，初中缩短为二年。初中班一般设毛泽东思想、数学、工农业生产知识三门课程，有的单独开设了理化基础知识课。
    四、工农兵登上了讲台。请有实践经验的工农兵作学工、学农、学军的教员，由他们领导师生参加生产实践，有的还种了“试验田”。
    五、彻底改革了招生制度，废除了考试办法。初中招生采取“生产队推荐，大队审查，公社选拔，教师参加”的办法，由贫下中农直接掌握招生大权，保证了突出无产阶级政治，贯彻党的阶级路线。
    六、减轻了贫下中农的负担，大有利于学校为贫下中农子女开门。学生就近上学，食宿在家，劳动在队，只交几元钱学杂费。学生本人参加集体劳动所得报酬，足够自己吃用，不用家长负担。
    七、发扬了“抗大”精神，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，勤俭办学。简阳县办几百个初中班，没有伸手向国家要人要钱。所需教员，一是从经过劳动锻炼的工农出身的知识青年和复员军人中选拔一批，其报酬由社队集体负担；一是现有学校缩短学制，紧缩编制定额，挤出一批；一是由一批社队干部和工农兵担任兼职义务教员。所需教室设备，一是充分利用现有的，有的把办公室都挤出来作教室；一是依靠师生自己动手，劳动建校。
    一代有社会主义觉悟、有文化的新型农民，正在这种新型学校中培养出来
    在这种新型学校培养的中学生，与旧学校培养的中学生大不相同。无产阶级文化大革命前，不少学生读了九年书，不知道什么是地主，什么是长工。有的读到十六、七岁，只在四清时听过一次贫下中农忆苦思甜的报告，进城读了几年中学，就看不起贫下中农。现在的初中班，天天读毛主席的书，经常有贫下中农来讲阶级斗争课，随时批判资产阶级。学生的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟普遍提高，积极参加社队的阶级斗争，热心为贫下中农服务。许多学生成了社队宣传毛泽东思想，批判资产阶级的积极分子，有的学生在队上天天坚持土广播，有的学生学会了理发技术，自己买剪子到地头田边为贫下中农义务理发，很受贫下中农的欢迎。
    过去贫下中农子女进城读中学，越读越不爱劳动，越读越怕艰苦，越读越讲究吃穿。现在，初中班的中学生，既是学生，又是社员，没有那种“洋学生”的臭架子。除农忙假、例假日全部参加社队集体劳动外，平时上学前、放学后都参加劳动，能做一班工（两个多小时）。他们打赤脚、穿草鞋，有的上学还带上粪筐，在来回途中拣粪，有的还兼任队上的记分员。
    贫下中农对自己办的初中班和学生的表现，看在眼里，喜在心上，热情地赞扬说：“这样的学校突出无产阶级政治，结合生产劳动，不脱离贫下中农，培养出来的学生才不会忘本，才能当无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    简阳县农村小学附设初中班，虽然才兴办不久，但它的优越性和生命力已确定地显示了出来。简阳县为什么能够在并不长的时间内，在举办初中班上做出这样的成绩呢？根本的一条是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在政治、思想上开展了对于修正主义教育路线的群众性大批判，在组织上保证了贫下中农对学校的直接管理，打破了资产阶级知识分子的一统天下，树立了贫下中农在学校中的优势。文权掌握在贫下中农手里，他们就能够坚决按照毛主席的教育革命思想办事，多快好省地发展广大贫下中农所需要的社会主义教育事业。
