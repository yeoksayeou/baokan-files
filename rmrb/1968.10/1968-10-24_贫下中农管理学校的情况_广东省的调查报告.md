The editor's note: The following is a report from the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee on the situation of poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools. It is hoped that this will draw the attention of revolutionary committees at all levels in provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and counties across the country to the issue of educational revolution in rural areas. According to Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution, achieving a proletarian educational revolution among hundreds of millions of peasants, having poor and lower-middle peasants directly manage schools, and thoroughly changing the bourgeoisie's control over schools is a great event. It is hoped that various places will provide typical examples in this regard. Regarding the report's lack of discussion on public and private schools (i.e., schools directly run by production brigades and communes of poor and lower-middle peasants), and which is better, as well as how to reform unreasonable relationships in rural schools, it is hoped that everyone will continue to provide experiences.

There are three situations regarding poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools:

1. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," some units in various regions began managing schools in the second half of last year. The appearance of these schools has undergone profound changes, and remarkable achievements have been made. These advanced units include: Xizhou Brigade in Zengcheng County, Huizhou District; Liling Brigade in Huizhou County; Hengbei Commune in Enping County, Foshan District; Lanshi Commune in the suburbs of Foshan City; Shaxi Brigade in Zhongshan County; Qianjin Brigade in Nanhai County; Liuyun Brigade in Xinyi County, Zhanjiang District; Songgui Brigade in Yunnan County, Zhaoqing District, etc.

2. After Chairman Mao's latest directive on "poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools" reached the countryside, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed and quickly launched a wave of learning, propaganda, and implementation. They formed a vast Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and took over the management of rural primary and secondary schools. This is the most common situation.

3. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of poor and lower-middle peasants took over the teacher training classes, focusing on the work of cleaning up the teacher cadre and formulating specific measures for managing schools.

1. Changes after poor and lower-middle peasants manage schools

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, after poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of rural schools, the appearance of the schools has changed greatly.

After poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of schools, the first thing they did was to implement Chairman Mao's latest directive. The first lesson they taught was on Mao Zedong Thought education, and the first activity they organized was the "Three Loyalty" activity, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions in the school. They generally rectified the school atmosphere, established a new revolutionary order; established early reporting, late reporting, daily reading, lecture meetings, and "Three Loyalty" evaluation system. The poor and lower-middle peasants in Shaxi Brigade, Zhongshan County, Foshan District, also helped revolutionary teachers and students form 57 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going to production teams every night to propagate and guide community members in learning, organizing community members to carry out "Three Loyalty" and "All Red Family" activities. Many students are active members in learning Chairman Mao's works in school, excellent Mao Zedong Thought propagandists in production teams, and guides in using Mao Zedong Thought at home. Poor and lower-middle peasants said: Poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools is good in every way, but occupying the school positions with Mao Zedong Thought is the best.

Poor and lower-middle peasants took control of the school leadership, thoroughly changing the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals controlling schools. They broke the situation where schools were not fighting, criticizing, or changing. Many schools that had long been in internal strife quickly achieved the goal of resuming classes and making revolution, and the attendance rate in many places reached 100%.

After poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of schools, they smashed the old bourgeois educational system, abolished the enrollment system based on scores, and broke through the five barriers of scores, tuition, examinations, promotions, and age that had blocked poor and lower-middle peasants' children from entering schools. They thoroughly changed the previous situation where poor and lower-middle peasants' children were discriminated against. For example, Dahan Primary School in Hengbei Commune, Enping County, previously had more than 70 poor and lower-middle peasants' children unreasonably expelled from school, but now they have all returned to school. Poor and lower-middle peasants are very enthusiastic about running schools. Many communes and brigades rely on self-reliance to expand schools, popularize primary education, and ensure that all school-age children are enrolled. They also follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "attach initial middle school classes to primary schools" and set up initial middle school classes. In Zengcheng County, there are 162 initial middle school classes attached to rural primary schools, with 7,900 students enrolled, which is equivalent to nine times the number of students enrolled in full-time middle schools each year. In the past, poor and lower-middle peasants could not interfere with school affairs, and teachers either taught or managed, but now poor and lower-middle peasants manage schools as masters, actively find solutions, make suggestions, and care about the educational revolution everywhere. In Xizhou Brigade, Zengcheng County, many poor and lower-middle peasants actively participated in teaching, listening to classes, and evaluating teaching, changing the long-standing phenomenon of "parents managing clothing and food, teachers managing teaching and literacy, and brigade cadres managing funding." Poor and lower-middle peasants took to the podium, greatly improving the teaching quality. Many revolutionary teachers and students said: In the past, under the control of bourgeois intellectuals, we read dead books, but now we learn living knowledge. Old poor peasants teach us class education courses, the more we listen, the more we hate class enemies, and the more we listen, the more we love Chairman Mao.

After poor and lower-middle peasants took over the management of schools, they focused on class struggle, solved many "old difficult" problems, and continuously improved the political awareness of teachers and students. Through the cleaning up of class ranks, a group of bad elements who had infiltrated the teacher cadre were exposed. The broad masses of teachers and students are highly enthusiastic about the revolution, determined to accept the re-education of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants, and to walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants. Revolutionary teachers in Shaxi Brigade, Zhongshan County, voluntarily went to the masses, practiced "five together" (eating, living, working, studying, and criticizing and reforming together) with poor and lower-middle peasants, and were determined to serve poor and lower-middle peasants for life.

2. Methods of poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools

1. Emphasize political leadership, adhere to the proletarian political direction, and take the path of political school construction. List the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought as the most important course; hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes; use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, transform everything, and criticize everything.

2. Focus on class struggle and carry out a revolutionary criticism. Poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools is a sharp class struggle. In many places, when poor and lower-middle peasants manage schools, a small group of class enemies jump out to oppose, saying things like "peasants have no culture and do not understand how to manage schools. Educational revolution is the school's business, and poor and lower-middle peasants have nothing to do with it." Faced with the provocation of class enemies, poor and lower-middle peasants mobilized the broad revolutionary teachers and students to carry out struggles against enemies and organized the broad masses of teachers and students to expose, accuse, and criticize the revisionist educational black line. They deeply carried out the educational revolution. Poor and lower-middle peasants said: "If we poor and lower-middle peasants do not hold the cultural power, we will lose political power. With Chairman Mao supporting us, we will definitely hold the power of the school."

3. The specific measures for poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools are generally as follows:

1. Abolish the old principal responsibility system and class leader responsibility system, and establish a school management leadership team and teaching class guidance group composed mainly of poor and lower-middle peasants. The teaching class is organized into classes, platoons, and companies, with several teaching reform groups set up respectively.

2. The commune and brigade list school education as an important agenda item, make unified arrangements, and implement unified leadership. Regularly research and formulate teaching plans and inspect and summarize teaching work.

3. Poor and lower-middle peasants, activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, demobilized soldiers, and militiamen respectively take charge of class struggle, production struggle education, and guide the study and application of Chairman Mao's works.

4. The commune, brigade, and school jointly do a good job in the ideological work of teachers and students, and parents. Arrange for teachers and students to participate in the three great revolutionary movements, and establish a labor participation system. Teachers and students participate in the learning activities of studying Mao Zedong Thought organized by production teams, and together with poor and lower-middle peasants "criticize and reform the self," and transform their worldview. Poor and lower-middle peasants regularly evaluate teachers' "five together," make political appraisals, and promote the thought revolution of the teacher cadre.

5. The school and production team closely cooperate to do a good job in the education of preschool children.

    贫下中农管理学校的情况
    ——广东省的调查报告
    编者按：现将广东省革命委员会关于贫下中农管理学校的调查报告发表，希望进一步引起全国各省、市、自治区以及地、县、公社各级革命委员会都来注意农村的教育革命问题。根据毛主席关于教育革命的各项指示，在几亿农民中实现无产阶级教育革命，由贫下中农直接管理学校，彻底改变资产阶级对学校的统治，这是一个伟大的事件。希望各地都提供这方面的典型材料。对于这个调查报告中没有涉及的公办学校和民办学校（即由生产大队和公社贫下中农直接办校）何者较好，以及农村学校中怎样改革不合理的关系，希望大家继续提供经验。
    贫下中农管理学校有三种情况：　（1）在毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉指引下，各地区都有少数单位于去年下半年就把学校管理起来了。现在这些学校的面貌发生了深刻的变化，取得了显著的成绩。这些先进单位有：惠阳专区增城县的西洲大队，惠阳县的沥林大队；佛山专区恩平县的横陂公社，佛山市郊的澜石公社，中山县的沙溪大队，南海县的前进大队；湛江专区信宜县的六云大队；肇庆专区郁南县的宋桂大队，等。
  （2）毛主席关于“贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示传到农村后，广大贫下中农欢欣鼓舞，迅速掀起了学习、宣传、贯彻的热潮，开出了浩浩荡荡的毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻管理农村中、小学校。这种为数较多。（3）贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队进驻教师集训班，着重抓清理教师队伍工作，制定具体管理学校的措施。
    一、贫下中农管理学校后发生的变化
    贫下中农遵循毛主席的教导，把农村学校管理起来后，使学校面貌发生了很大的变化。
    贫下中农管理学校后，办的第一件事就是贯彻毛主席的最新指示，上的第一课就是毛泽东思想教育课，组织的第一个活动就是“三忠于”活动，让毛泽东思想占领学校一切阵地。普遍整顿了校风，建立了革命的新秩序；建立了早请示，晚汇报，天天读，讲用会和“三忠于”评比制度。佛山专区中山县沙溪大队的贫下中农还帮助革命师生组成了五十七个毛泽东思想宣传队，每天晚上到生产队进行宣传和辅导社员学习，组织社员开展“三忠于”和“全家红”活动。许多学生在学校是学习毛主席著作的积极分子，在生产队是优秀的毛泽东思想宣传员，在家里是活学活用毛泽东思想的辅导员。贫下中农满意地说：贫下中农管理学校千好万好，用毛泽东思想占领学校阵地最好。
    贫下中农掌握了学校的领导权，彻底改变了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象。打开了学校一不斗，二不批，三不改的局面。许多学校过去长期“内战”不休，贫下中农管理学校后，迅速地实现了复课闹革命，许多地方学生到校率普遍达到百分之百。
    贫下中农管理学校后，砸烂了旧的资产阶级教育制度，废除了分数招生制，打破了封锁贫下中农子女进校的分数、学费、考试、升学、年龄五道关，彻底改变了过去贫下中农子女受排斥的地位。如恩平县横陂公社大亨小学过去有七十多个贫下中农子女被无理推出校门，现在都重新复了学。贫下中农办学的积极性很高，许多公社、大队依靠自力更生，扩建了学校，普及了小学教育，使适龄儿童全部入了学，并遵照毛主席关于“小学校附设初中班”的教导，增设了初中班。增城县农村小学附设初中班达一百六十二班，入学人数七千九百多人，相当于原来全日制中学每年招生人数的九倍。过去贫下中农过问不了学校，教师管教不管导，现在贫下中农以主人翁的姿态管理学校，主动想办法，提建议，处处关心教育革命。增城县西洲大队许多贫下中农主动参加了讲课、听课和评教活动，改变了过去长期存在的“家长管穿衣食饭，教师管教书识字，大队干部管拨款”的现象。贫下中农登上了讲台，大大提高了教学质量，许多革命师生说：过去在资产阶级知识分子统治下，我们读的是死书，现在学的是活知识。老贫农给我们上阶级教育课，我们越听对阶级敌人越恨，越听对毛主席越亲。
    贫下中农管理学校后，狠抓了阶级斗争，解决了许多“老大难”问题和不断提高了师生的政治觉悟。通过清理阶级队伍，揪出了一批混进教师队伍中的坏人。广大师生革命积极性很高，决心接受工人阶级和贫下中农的再教育，走与工农相结合的道路。中山县沙溪大队的革命教师自觉地到群众中去，同贫下中农实行“五同”（同食、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修），决心为贫下中农服务一辈子。
    二、贫下中农管理学校的做法
    （一）突出政治领导，坚持无产阶级政治方向，走政治建校的道路。把活学活用毛泽东思想列为头等重要的课程；举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班；用毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切，批判一切。
    （二）狠抓阶级斗争，开展革命大批判。贫下中农管理学校是一场尖锐的阶级斗争，许多地方当贫下中农管理学校的时候，一小撮阶级敌人就跳出来反对，说什么“农民没文化，不懂管理学校。教育革命是学校的事，贫下中农管不着。”贫下中农面对着阶级敌人的挑衅，发动了广大革命师生，开展了对敌斗争，并组织广大师生对修正主义教育黑线进行了大揭发，大控诉，大批判。深入开展教育革命。贫下中农说：“我们贫下中农不掌好文权，就会丢失政权。有毛主席给我们撑腰，学校大权我们掌定了。”
    （三）贫下中农管理学校的具体措施大体有如下几方面：
    （1）废除旧的校长负责制和班主任责任制，建立起由贫下中农为主的“三结合”的管理学校领导班子和教学班的辅导组。把教学班组编成班、排、连，分别设立若干教改小组。
    （2）公社、大队把学校教育列入重要议事日程，统一部署，实行一元化领导。定期研究制定教学计划和检查总结教学工作。
    （3）由贫下中农、学习毛主席著作积极分子、退伍军人和民兵分别担任阶级斗争、生产斗争的教育和辅导活学活用毛主席著作。
    （4）公社、大队和学校共同做好师生、家长的思想工作。安排师生参加三大革命运动，建立参加劳动制度。师生参加生产队组织的活学活用毛泽东思想的学习活动，同贫下中农一起“斗私，批修”，改造世界观。贫下中农定期对教师进行“五同”评定，做政治鉴定，促进教师队伍思想革命化。
    （5）学校、生产队密切配合，共同做好学龄前儿童的教育工作。
