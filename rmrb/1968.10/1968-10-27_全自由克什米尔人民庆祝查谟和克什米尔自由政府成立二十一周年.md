The people of Azad Jammu and Kashmir celebrated the 21st anniversary of the establishment of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government with great enthusiasm on the 24th.

A military parade was held in Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government, to mark the occasion.

Abdul Hamid Khan, the President of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government, addressed the troops during the inspection, stating that the people of Kashmir are resolute in their determination. As long as the entire population of Kashmir, whose homeland is currently occupied and harassed by Indian expansionists, does not achieve liberation, they will not rest. This is a sacred mission.

In a radio broadcast on the eve of the anniversary, Abdul Hamid Khan said that the people of Kashmir will use every means to fight for their right to self-determination. He also criticized the United Nations' stance on the Kashmir issue, stating that the United Nations treats the people of Kashmir as sacrifices for its great power politics.

On the 24th, Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Asad Husain, addressed the public in Rawalpindi, stating that Pakistan guarantees support for the people of Kashmir in their struggle for self-determination. Pakistan will uphold this pledge and continue to do so.

    在查谟和克什米尔自由政府首府穆扎法拉巴德举行了军事检阅，庆祝这个节日。
    查谟和克什米尔自由政府主席阿卜杜勒·哈米德·汗向受检阅的部队发表讲话说，克什米尔人民抱着不可动摇的决心，只要全克什米尔人民——他们的家园现在被印度扩张主义者占领和骚扰——不获解放，就决不罢休。这是一个神圣的事业。
