The Revolutionary Committee of the Harbin Electric Machine Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, has followed Chairman Mao's instructions to fully mobilize the worker masses to re-educate intellectuals. This has enabled the technicians in this factory to take a gratifying step forward in the path of integrating with the workers.

The Harbin Electric Machine Factory is a large factory with over 8,000 people, including more than 1,300 technicians.

After the establishment of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, the working class decided to transform the intellectuals according to their own spiritual outlook. They sent more than 90% of the technicians from all departments and the factory-affiliated Electric Machine Research Institute to the workshops and teams to work as laborers, allowing the workers to re-educate the intellectuals.

The broad masses of workers in this factory, with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, enthusiastically use Mao Zedong Thought to re-educate the intellectuals. They said, "We not only need to produce new products for the country, but more importantly, we need to cultivate new people for the country." Many veteran workers in various teams proactively approach these intellectuals, have heart-to-heart talks with them, understand their real thoughts, and help them raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Some veteran workers who suffered greatly in the old society conduct class education on recalling bitterness and thinking sweetness. When the technicians first arrived at the workshops, they were not familiar with the actual operations, so the workers enthusiastically taught them by hand, deeply moving them.

The factory's Revolutionary Committee also uses the method of focusing on exemplary cases to enhance the enthusiasm of technicians and workers to integrate. Recently, the factory Revolutionary Committee organized a group of intellectuals who had previously integrated well with the workers and had made some inventions and innovations to hold a special Mao Zedong Thought study class. They summarized and exchanged their experiences of integrating with the workers and organized them to give lectures in the workshops.

After the technicians of the Harbin Electric Machine Factory went to the workshops to work as laborers and received re-education from the workers, their thoughts and feelings began to change. The deep class feelings of the working class's unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, their fine traditions of hard work and simplicity, and their strict organizational discipline and order have deeply educated this group of technicians who went to the workshops to work as laborers. They are determined to learn well from the workers, strive to transform their worldview, and forge themselves into staunch revolutionary fighters of the proletariat.

    哈尔滨电机厂大部分技术员下车间当工人
    哈尔滨电机厂革命委员会，在人民解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照毛主席的教导，充分发动工人群众对知识分子进行再教育，使这个厂的技术人员在与工人相结合的道路上迈出了可喜的一步。
    哈尔滨电机厂是一个拥有八千多人的大厂，技术人员有一千三百多名。
    厂革命委员会成立后，工人阶级决心按照自己的精神面貌来改造知识分子。他们把全厂科室和厂属的电机研究所中百分之九十以上的技术人员下放到车间、班组当工人，由工人对知识分子进行再教育。
    这个工厂的广大工人，以高度的革命责任感，用毛泽东思想热情地对知识分子进行再教育。他们说，我们不仅要给国家生产新产品，更重要的还要给国家培养新人。很多班组的老工人，主动接近这些知识分子，跟他们谈心，了解他们的活思想，帮助他们提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。一些在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人，对他们进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育。技术人员刚到车间，实际操作不熟悉，工人就热情地把着手教，使他们深受感动。
    厂革命委员会还采用抓典型的办法，以活的榜样来提高技术人员和工人相结合的积极性。最近厂革委会把过去同工人结合得好的并有所发明创造的知识分子组织起来，专门开办了一期毛泽东思想学习班，总结和交流他们与工人相结合的经验，并组织他们到车间讲用。
    哈尔滨电机厂的技术人员下车间当工人，接受工人再教育以后，思想感情开始有了变化，工人阶级无限忠于毛主席的深厚的阶级感情，艰苦朴素的优良传统，严格的组织性和纪律性，使这批下车间当工人的技术人员受到深刻的教育，他们决心好好地向工人学习，努力改造自己的世界观，把自己锻炼成坚强的无产阶级革命战士。
