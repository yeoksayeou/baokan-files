At a meeting held by the revolutionary teachers and students of Guelin No. 8 Middle School to criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in the school, the speeches given by the students of Class 14 were particularly noteworthy. One after another, they fired at the class enemies, with every word and sentence hitting the enemies' hearts. Everyone praised them, saying, "Their firepower is concentrated, and their criticism is powerful." The students excitedly said, "It was Master Wei from the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team who helped us onto the battlefield of struggle, criticism, and transformation."

The story is as follows: After the Worker Propaganda Team entered No. 8 Middle School, Master Wei from the Guelin Smelting Plant was assigned to work in Class 14. He found that some students in the class would come and go as they pleased, not settling down to engage in struggle, criticism, and transformation. They said, "After all, we are about to graduate and be assigned jobs. The school's struggle, criticism, and transformation are none of our business." Hearing these reflections, Master Wei wanted to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them and have a good talk. However, he went there more than ten times and always missed them. Master Wei was not discouraged at all. He would find one student and do ideological work with her, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "seriously carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation."

In his extensive contact with the students, Master Wei found that Yang Yuanfan had a certain influence among the students, so he decided to focus on doing ideological work with Little Yang. The first time they had a heart-to-heart talk, she said nothing, and the effect was not great. Master Wei continued to find her and study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with her, telling her about his own bitter family history. The class struggle washed away the dust in Little Yang's soul, and Master Wei's earnest words deeply touched her thoughts. She was very moved and said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!' But I was thinking about how to be assigned a job, running around everywhere, not settling down to engage in struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Struggle, criticism, and transformation are my battle tasks. If I don't fight this battle well, I will not retreat." Little Yang's change of mind influenced other students. They all expressed their determination to take Master Wei as an example, with the deepest class feelings for Chairman Mao, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively.

    韦师傅帮助我们杀上了斗批改战场
    在广西柳州八中革命师生批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本校代理人的一个大会上，十四班同学的发言，尤其引人注意。她们一个接一个地向阶级敌人开炮，字字句句打中了阶级敌人的胸膛。大伙都称赞她们：“火力集中，批得有力。”同学们兴奋地说：“这是工人毛泽东思想宣传队的韦师傅帮助我们杀上了斗批改战场。”
    事情是这样的：工人宣传队进驻八中后，柳州冶炼厂韦师傅被分配到第十四班工作。他发现这个班有的同学，想来就来，说走就走，不安心在学校搞斗批改。她们说：反正快毕业分配了，学校斗批改不关我们的事。听了这些反映，韦师傅想找她们一块学习毛主席最新指示，好好谈一谈。可是，连续去了十几次都扑了空。韦师傅丝毫没有灰心，他找到一个同学就做一个同学的思想工作，向她们宣传毛主席关于“认真搞好斗、批、改”的最新指示。
    在和同学广泛接触中，韦师傅发现杨远帆同学在学生中有一定影响，便决定重点做好小杨的思想工作。第一次谈心，她一言不发，效果不大。韦师傅又继续找她，和她一起学习毛主席最新指示，讲述自己苦难的家史。阶级的苦水冲刷着小杨灵魂深处的灰尘，韦师傅语重心长的话，深深触动了小杨的思想，她十分激动地说：“毛主席教导我们：‘你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！’可是，我想的是如何分配，成天东走西窜，不安心搞斗批改，这是对毛主席的不忠。斗批改就是我的战斗任务，不打好这一仗，决不收兵。”小杨思想的转变，影响了其他同学。她们纷纷表示，决心以韦师傅为榜样，怀着对毛主席最深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作。
    从此以后，在十四班教室里，经常可以看到同学们和韦师傅在一起，她们愤怒控诉资产阶级教育路线对自己的侵蚀。现在她们在韦师傅的帮助下，又杀上了斗批改的战场！
