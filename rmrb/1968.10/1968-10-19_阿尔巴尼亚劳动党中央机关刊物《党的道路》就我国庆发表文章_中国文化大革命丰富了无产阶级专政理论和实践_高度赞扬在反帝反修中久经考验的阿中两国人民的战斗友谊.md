The Central Organ of the Albanian Party of Labour, "The Party's Road," published an article in its 10th issue to commemorate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The article is titled: "The People's Republic of China—The Strongest Bastion of World Socialism, Communism, and the Freedom and Independence of the Peoples of All Countries."

The article states that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has revolutionized the thinking of hundreds of millions of working people, raised their political consciousness and revolutionary spirit, and further advanced China's economy, culture, technology, and science. During the Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, have delivered a fatal blow to the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of all exploiting classes. They have exposed, struck, and fundamentally smashed the bourgeois, revisionist, and counter-revolutionary elements headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. Except for Taiwan, which is occupied by U.S. imperialism, revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China. This is a new and significant victory of great historical importance in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has not only eliminated the direct threat to the people's China but has also destroyed the social basis for spreading revisionism and restoring capitalism, defeated the domestic enemy, and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. It has ensured the victory of socialism and the progress of the Chinese people towards communism, making the People's Republic of China forever red.

The article states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has important historical significance that transcends the borders of the people's China. This revolution is an important part of the current world proletarian revolution that fundamentally shakes the positions of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has further enriched the theory and practice of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It has become a great revolutionary example. It shows how to defend the people's power, the fruits of the revolution, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and how to rely on the working people led by the working class to smash the enemy. It is a great education for true Marxists and the working people in countries ruled by the revisionist clique. It teaches them how to stand up, overthrow and eliminate the revisionist traitors who have usurped power and restored capitalism, and how to fight for regaining freedom and independence and rebuilding the dictatorship of the proletariat. The article states that the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the magnificent achievements of the Chinese people in the fields of industry, agriculture, culture, science, technology, and national defense have foiled the plans, conspiracies, hopes, and dreams of the imperialists and modern revisionists, making them feel their inevitable doom.

The article states that the international prestige and reputation of the great China with a population of 700 million have been higher than ever before. It has become the main force and the greatest, most important, and most powerful pillar of the world people's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, and the vanguard warrior of world peace. When we condemned the aggressive Warsaw Pact, the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people immediately supported our country and our people. The great Chinese people resolutely condemned the savage invasion of the Czechoslovak people by the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys, once again clearly demonstrating their internationalist stance. The true revolutionaries and freedom-loving people of the world regard the People's Republic of China as their powerful and unbreakable ally, as the steadfast and unyielding defender of the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries. The working people of all continents and all countries have deep affection, respect, and admiration for the great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong. Today, when the imperialism of the United States and its allies, the Khrushchev revisionists, are more aggressive than ever, the eyes and hearts of the peoples of all countries suffering under the yoke of imperialism and revisionism are turned towards the powerful and faithful defender of the peoples of all countries, the insurmountable obstacle to the aggressive plans of the U.S.-Soviet counter-revolutionary clique—the People's Republic of China.

The article states that the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of all countries, while tightening their comprehensive collusion, are directing their main thrust against the People's Republic of China. However, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If the enemy opposes us, that is good, that means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slanders us, and says we are worthless, that is even better, that means we not only have drawn a clear line with the enemy but also means our work has been very successful." The plans and dreams of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and other reactionaries to "contain" the people's China from advancing on the road of socialism and revolution, as well as their conspiracy to reverse the wheel of history, have already suffered a shameful failure and been thoroughly smashed in the face of the revolutionary might of the great Chinese people.

The article highly praises the fraternal friendship between the peoples of Albania and China. The article points out that this friendship was personally forged by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha; it is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism; it has been tested in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and in the construction of socialism and revolution.

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关刊物《党的道路》就我国庆发表文章
    中国文化大革命丰富了无产阶级专政理论和实践
    高度赞扬在反帝反修中久经考验的阿中两国人民的战斗友谊
    据新华社地拉那十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关刊物《党的道路》第十期就中华人民共和国成立十九周年发表一篇文章，题目是：《中华人民共和国——世界社会主义、共产主义和各国人民的自由和独立的最强大的堡垒》。
    文章说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命，已经使亿万劳动群众的思想革命化，提高了他们的政治觉悟和革命精神，使中国的经济、文化、技术和科学得到了进一步的跃进。在无产阶级文化大革命中，亿万工、农、兵、红卫兵、革命知识分子和革命干部在毛泽东同志的直接领导下，给了一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗和旧习惯以致命的打击，揭露、打击和从根本上粉碎了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级、修正主义者和反革命分子。除被美帝占领的台湾省以外，中国全国各省、市、自治区都建立了革命委员会，这是中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的具有重大历史意义的新胜利。
    文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命不仅消除了直接威胁人民中国的危险，而且摧毁了传播修正主义和复辟资本主义的社会基础，打垮了国内的敌人，巩固了无产阶级专政；确保了社会主义的胜利果实和中国人民向共产主义迈进，使中华人民共和国永远不改变鲜红的颜色。
    文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的重要历史意义已经超越了人民中国的国界。这场革命具有世界历史性的伟大的重要意义。它是从根本上动摇帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的阵地的当今世界无产阶级革命的重要的组成部分。中国无产阶级文化大革命进一步丰富了无产阶级专政的理论和实践。它成了一个伟大的革命的榜样。它指出了应当怎样保卫人民政权、革命胜利果实和无产阶级专政，应当怎样有力地依靠以工人阶级为首的劳动群众来粉碎敌人。它对真正的马克思主义者和在修正主义集团统治的国家中的劳动人民，是一次伟大的教育。它教导他们应当怎样站起来，推翻和消灭窃取政权和复辟资本主义的修正主义叛徒，应当怎样为重新赢得自由和独立，重建无产阶级专政而斗争。文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利以及中国人民在工业、农业、文化、科学、技术和国防各个领域里取得的宏伟成就，使帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的计划、阴谋、希望和梦想破了产，使它们感到了它们的不可避免的末日。
    文章说，七亿人口的伟大中国的国际威望和声誉比以往任何时候都提高了。她成了世界人民反帝、反修斗争的主要力量和最巨大、最主要、最有力的支柱，成了世界和平的先锋战士。当我们谴责侵略性的华沙条约时，中华人民共和国和中国人民立即支持我们祖国和我国人民。伟大的中国人民坚决谴责苏联修正主义者及其仆从对捷克斯洛伐克人民的野蛮侵略，再次清楚地表现了他们的国际主义立场。全世界真正的革命者和爱好自由的人民把中华人民共和国看作是他们强大的牢不可破的同盟者，看作是各国人民自由和独立的坚强不屈和始终不渝的捍卫者。全世界人民、各大洲普通的劳动人民对伟大的中国人民、中国共产党和毛泽东同志怀有热烈的爱戴、深厚的感情和非常的尊敬。今天，当美帝国主义及其同盟者——赫鲁晓夫修正主义者变得比以往任何时候更加富于侵略性的时候，在帝国主义、修正主义的枷锁下受苦的各国人民的眼睛和心灵向着各国人民的强大的忠实的捍卫者、美帝和苏修反革命集团侵略计划的不可逾越的障碍——中华人民共和国。
    文章说，以美帝为首的帝国主义者，以苏修为首的现代修正主义者和各国反动派一边加紧他们的全面勾结，一边把主要矛头针对中华人民共和国。但是，正如毛泽东同志所说的：“如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者和其他反动派“遏制”人民中国在社会主义和革命的道路上前进的计划和梦想，以及他们妄图扭转历史车轮的阴谋，在伟大的中国人民的革命威力前面已经遭到了可耻的失败，已经被彻底粉碎了。
    文章高度赞扬了阿中两国人民的战斗友谊。文章指出，这种友谊是由毛泽东同志和霍查同志亲手缔造的；是以马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义为基础的；是在反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，在社会主义革命和建设中经受了考验的。
