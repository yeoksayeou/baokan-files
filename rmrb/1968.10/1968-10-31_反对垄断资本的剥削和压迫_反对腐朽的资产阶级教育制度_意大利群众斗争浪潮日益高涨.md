The masses in Italy are increasingly rising up to oppose the exploitation and oppression of the monopoly bourgeoisie. Workers in more than 20 provinces in southern Italy have recently staged successive general strikes, demanding wage increases and full employment. Students in many Italian cities have also gone on strike, held demonstrations, and occupied schools to protest against the decayed bourgeois education system and to condemn the reactionary authorities' suppression of the student movement.

On October 28, workers in the entire Sardinia region, as well as in the provinces of Agrigento, Caltanissetta, Catania, Enna, and Ragusa in Sicily, went on a general strike, paralyzing large areas of southern Italy. Workers in many cities in these two regions held mass rallies and demonstrations to protest against the brutal exploitation by Italian monopoly capital and to denounce the worsening unemployment situation.

In Palermo, the capital of Sicily, several dozen workers who had been unjustly laid off occupied the building of the regional government's industrial department on October 28 to express their protest.

Meanwhile, Italian students have launched a new wave of struggle. In Messina, Sicily, students occupied the University of Messina on October 28 and held a mass rally of 3,000 people to protest the police's intrusion into the campus and disruption of the students' meeting. To support the university students' just struggle, middle school students in Messina went on strike. In Agrigento, Sicily, 5,000 students went on strike and marched on the same day to protest the reactionary authorities' unjust arrest of 10 students. In Sassari, Sardinia, students held a protest rally and distributed leaflets to protest the school authorities' unjust order to suspend 60 students.

In Rome, the capital of Italy, as well as in Foggia and Crotone in southern Italy, and Rimini, Mantua, and Bologna in northern Italy, students have recently held rallies, gone on strike, occupied schools, and held demonstrations to protest the reactionary authorities' suppression of the student movement and to demand the guarantee of students' right to assemble on campus.
