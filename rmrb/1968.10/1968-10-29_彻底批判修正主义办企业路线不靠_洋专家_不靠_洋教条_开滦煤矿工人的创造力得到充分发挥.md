In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the heroic workers of the Kaiping Coal Mine, with the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine, seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and from bourgeois technical "authorities," and thoroughly criticized the revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by China's Khrushchev. This led to a surge in technological innovation and revolution, bringing about a new leap in coal production at the Kaiping Mine.

Kaiping Coal Mine is one of the oldest and largest coal mines in China. Before liberation, it was long occupied by British, American, and Japanese imperialists and the reactionary Kuomintang, resulting in backward production technology, primitive equipment, and extremely poor working conditions for the workers. After liberation, China's Khrushchev and his agents at the Kaiping Mine promoted a policy of crawling, shielding and promoting bourgeois technical "authorities," and obstructing workers' suggestions for technological improvements. An old worker at the Kaiping Zhao Gezhuang Mine proposed a simple machine to save pit props. Despite repeated applications and requests for support, no one paid attention. Later, when this old worker made a model and handed it over to the "leadership," it was taken home by the "leader" and used as a toy for his child.

In 1958, under the guidance of the Three Red Banners, Kaiping Coal Mine promoted over a hundred workers to become engineer-technicians and technical staff. However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and bourgeois technical "authorities" denigrated, marginalized, and suppressed these new technical cadres, claiming that worker-technical cadres had "no theory," "couldn't draw diagrams," and were unfit for "technical guidance" work. They also used their authority to set traps for the worker-technical cadres. Within less than a year, almost all of these new worker-technical cadres were driven out.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led personally by Chairman Mao, sounded the death knell for China's Khrushchev and his agents at the Kaiping Mine. Through continuous revolutionary criticism and exposure, the revisionist line of managing enterprises promoted by a handful of capitalist roaders at the Kaiping Mine, as well as their crimes of shielding bourgeois technical "authorities" and suppressing workers' revolutions, were thoroughly criticized. The creativity and intelligence of the Kaiping Mine workers were fully unleashed. Technological innovations and revolutions emerged one after another, with some projects reaching international standards. The simple machine proposed by an old worker at the Kaiping Zhao Gezhuang Mine, which was previously ignored, was successfully tested with the strong support of the new revolutionary committee. After going into formal production, it saved the country over forty cubic meters of pit props per day. The old worker excitedly said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's leadership of the Cultural Revolution, we workers would never have been able to hold our heads high. In the eyes of the capitalist roaders, we were still the 'miners' of the old society!"

At the Kaiping Linxi Mine, there was a British hoisting winch with an added fourteen-ton flywheel that consumed over eight hundred degrees of electricity daily. Workers had long proposed its removal, but bourgeois technical "authorities" suppressed the idea. During the Cultural Revolution, workers firmly proposed the plan to remove the flywheel. The "engineer" in charge of this equipment, on the eve of the reconstruction, took leave and went home, intending to laugh at the workers. The workers and cadres in charge of the construction were determined to make Chairman Mao proud and bring glory to the working class. They displayed a revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act, completing the flywheel reconstruction task before the "engineer" returned to the mine. Upon hearing the news of the successful flywheel reconstruction, the "engineer" was stunned.

During the process of technological innovation and revolution at the Kaiping Coal Mine, there was intense and complex class struggle. The process of creating the wind hammer silencer by the Li Yuming wind pump team in the Kaiping Tangshan Mine's development area is a clear example. The workers in the Li Yuming team felt the pain of the development workers operating the deafening wind hammers. With deep class feelings, they voluntarily formed an innovation team to solve this "old difficult" problem. At the end of 1966, when they first proposed the innovation suggestion for wind hammer silencing, they were suppressed by capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities." They were ridiculed and mocked, "Even experts haven't solved this problem, and you workers think you can?" Undeterred, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress." Mao Zedong Thought inspired Li Yuming and others to continue researching the wind hammer silencing problem. They found old materials and persisted in working during their spare time. Just as the wind hammer silencer was about to undergo industrial trials, a handful of capitalist roaders within the mine, taking advantage of the "January Storm" in Shanghai, staged a fake seizure of power. After seizing power, they, under the pretext of "promoting production," forcibly disbanded Li Yuming's innovation team, attempting to halt this invention and creation. Should this invention and creation be continued? Or should the trial be halted? This was not just a scientific and technological issue but also a struggle to smash the counter-revolutionary line of the bourgeoisie and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The class enemies used threats and intimidation, such as "stopping trial period wages" and "detention." "Conducting scientific experiments is not a crime!" The Li Yuming team fought against the class struggle, repeatedly foiling the class enemies' plots. With the support and assistance of the PLA, they declared the bankruptcy of the handful of capitalist roaders' "fake seizure of power." Under the care of the revolutionary committee, the wind hammer silencer finally achieved initial trial success. According to relevant research institutions, this wind hammer silencer, born in the midst of class struggle, has low cost, high sensitivity, good effect, and reaches world-class standards.

In the process of technological innovation and revolution, the working class of Kaiping Coal Mine insisted on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, did not rely on "foreign experts" or "foreign theories," did not seek grandeur or foreign influence, and started from the actual production needs to solve many key technical problems. The Wan Engui technical team at Kaiping Linxi Mine, after being liberated from the constraints of bourgeois technical "authorities," changed the dispersed heating system of the entire mine's boilers to a centralized heating system using waste gas from the power plant. This innovation saved the country over seven thousand five hundred tons of coal in one year. In the process of achieving this technological innovation, they insisted on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle. When they lacked steel pipes, Old Wan led everyone to learn from the Old Fool who moved mountains, digging up old steel pipes underground; when they lacked manpower, Old Wan led everyone to learn from Zhang Thide's spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people, and everyone worked hard to overcome the shortage of manpower.

In the past, the bourgeois technical "authorities" at Kaiping Fanggezhuang Mine handled underground transportation machinery with centralized control, seeking grandeur and foreign influence in technology, gathering many college graduates detached from production practice, who spent all day in the office, looking up references, and making plans, with no results after two or three months. Later, a few underground electrical repair workers from this mine, based on their practical experience and starting from production needs, successfully tested a comprehensive control box for four transportation machines after five days of hard work, with good results.

During the time when bourgeois technical "authorities" held the reins of technical power at the Kaiping Mechanical Repair Factory, they always used excuses like "the factory is small," "the equipment is poor," and "the technological level is low" to obstruct the processing of relatively large machine parts. Since the Cultural Revolution, workers have taken control of the technical power of production. Recently, they accepted the task of processing a seventy-ton hoisting machine part, but the technical conditions could only process a seven-ton part. However, they were not intimidated by the difficulties. The factory's revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's instructions of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," organized a three-in-one working group consisting of workers, engineering and technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres. They did not "worship foreigners" or "believe in superstitions," carried out revolutionary criticism on the spot, thoroughly criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist scientific and technological line of "experts managing factories" and "technology first," established a spirit of self-reliance and hard work, overcame various difficulties, and successfully completed the processing task of the seventy-ton hoisting machine part.

Over the past two years, the movement of technological innovation and revolution at Kaiping Coal Mine has flourished. Technological innovation and revolution have greatly promoted the development of productivity and ensured the completion of coal production tasks.

    彻底批判修正主义办企业路线不靠“洋专家”不靠“洋教条”
    开滦煤矿工人的创造力得到充分发挥
    两年多来，技术革新、技术革命运动蓬勃开展，促进了生产力的发展，保证了煤炭生产任务的完成
    本报讯　在无产阶级文化大革命中，具有光荣传统的开滦煤矿工人阶级，在驻矿解放军的支持和帮助下，夺了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”的权，专了他们的政，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线，掀起技术革新、技术革命高潮，使开滦煤矿生产出现了新的跃进局面。
    开滦煤矿是我国最古老、最大的煤矿之一。解放前，由于英、美、日帝国主义和国民党反动派长期霸占，生产技术落后，设备简陋，工人劳动条件十分恶劣。解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在开滦煤矿的代理人，推行爬行主义，包庇、重用资产阶级技术“权威”，对工人提出的改进技术的建议，百般刁难。开滦赵各庄矿的一个老工人，为了给国家节约坑木，要搞一台简易机械。他多次申请，要求支持，但无人理睬。后来，这个老工人做了一台模型交给“领导”。竟被这个“领导”拿回家去，给自己的小孩作了玩具。
    一九五八年，开滦煤矿在三面红旗的指引下，提拔了百余名工人工程师、工人技术员。当时党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”，对这批技术干部拚命贬低、排挤、打击。说工人技术干部“没理论”，“不会画图”，担负不了“技术指导”工作。并利用职权给工人出身的技术干部出难题。这批新生的工人技术干部，工作不到一年，几乎全部被他们排挤掉了。
    毛主席亲自领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在开滦煤矿代理人的丧钟。在不断开展革命大批判，狠揭狠批开滦矿一小撮走资派推行的修正主义办企业路线，及他们包庇资产阶级技术“权威”压制工人革命的罪行之后，开滦煤矿工人的创造力和才智得到了充分的发挥。技术革新、技术革命不断涌现，有的项目已达到国际水平。开滦赵各庄矿，原来不予理睬的那个老工人提出的节约坑木的简易机械，在新生的革命委员会的大力支持下，试验成功了。正式投产后，一天就给国家节省四十多立方米坑木。这个老工人激动地说：“要不是毛主席他老人家亲自领导的文化大革命，我们工人就是抬不起头来，在走资派眼底下，还不是旧社会的‘窑花子’！”
    开滦林西矿，有一台英国的提升绞车，原来增设了一个十四吨重的飞轮，每天白白消耗八百多度电。工人很早就提出拆除，但资产阶级技术“权威”百般进行压制。文化大革命中，工人坚决地提出拆除飞轮的方案。主管这台设备的“工程师”在改建施工前夕，却借故请假回家了，想看工人的笑话。担任施工的工人、干部决心为毛主席争气，为工人阶级争光，发扬了敢想、敢干的革命精神，没等这位“工程师”返矿，就把飞轮改建的任务完成了。当他返矿一听说飞轮改建成功的消息，竟惊得目瞪口呆。
    开滦煤矿在开展技术革新、技术革命的过程中，充满着尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争。开滦唐山矿开拓区李玉明风泵小组创造风锤消音器的过程，就是明显的例证。李玉明小组的工人每当看到开拓工人操着震耳的风锤生产的时候，就象自己身受一样。他们怀着深厚的阶级感情，自动结合成革新小组，来解决这个“老大难”问题。一九六六年底，当他们开始提出风锤消音的革新建议时，遭到走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”的压制。并讽刺挖苦说：“连专家都没解决的问题，你们工人想解决？”他们毫不灰心，认真学习毛主席教导：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”毛泽东思想鼓舞着李玉明等继续研究风锤消音问题。他们找旧料，坚持在业余时间干。就在风锤消音器正式进行工业性试验的时候，这个矿党内一小撮走资派，投上海“一月风暴”之机，导演了一场假夺权的丑剧。夺权后，他们以“促生产”为名，强行解散了李玉明等人的革新小组，妄图中断这项发明创造。是把这项发明创造坚持下去？还是中断试验？这不仅是科学技术上的问题，而且是一场粉碎资产阶级反动路线的反扑，捍卫毛主席革命路线的斗争。阶级敌人以“停发试验期工资”、“关押”等手段进行威胁恫吓。“搞科学试验没有罪！”李玉明小组迎着阶级斗争风浪进行战斗，一次又一次地粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。在解放军的支持和帮助下，宣判了党内一小撮走资派“假夺权”的破产。风锤消音器在革委会的关怀下，终于初步试验成功了。据有关科研部门鉴定，这个在阶级斗争风浪中诞生的风锤消音器，成本低，灵敏度强，效果好，达到世界先进水平。
    开滦煤矿工人阶级在技术革新、技术革命中坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，不靠“洋专家”，不靠“洋教条”，不贪大求洋，一切从生产实际出发，解决了很多生产技术上的关键问题。开滦林西矿有个万恩贵管工小组，他们从资产阶级技术“权威”束缚下解放出来以后，就把全矿用的锅炉分散供热系统改成用电厂废气集中供热。这项革新一年就给国家节约七千五百多吨煤。他们在实现这项技术革新过程中，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅。缺钢管，老万领着大伙学习老愚公，在地下挖废钢管；缺人力，老万就领着大伙学习张思德“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的革命精神，大伙鼓足干劲，克服了人力不足的困难。
    开滦范各庄矿，过去由资产阶级技术“权威”搞井下运输机集中控制。在技术上贪大求洋，聚集了很多脱离生产实践的大专院校毕业生，整天坐在办公室，翻资料，订方案，前后搞了两三个月没个眉目。后来这个矿的几个井下电气修理工，凭着他们的实践经验，本着从生产需要出发，经过五天的奋战，就试验成功一台四部运输机的综合控制箱，使用效果良好。
    开滦机械制修厂，过去资产阶级技术“权威”掌握技术大权的时候，要加工一个比较大的机件，他们总是以“厂子小”、“设备差”、“工艺水平低”等为借口进行阻挠。文化大革命以来，工人掌握了生产技术大权。最近他们接受了一台七十吨重的绞车部件加工任务，而技术条件只能加工七吨重的部件，但他们并没有被困难吓倒。这个厂的革命委员会，按照毛主席“两参一改三结合”的指示，组织了一个有工人、工程技术人员、革命干部参加的三结合施工小组，不“崇洋”，不“信邪”，在现场开展革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”“技术第一”的反革命修正主义科技路线，树立了发奋图强的精神，克服各种困难，成功地完成了七十吨重的绞车部件加工任务。
    两年多来，开滦煤矿的技术革新、技术革命运动蓬勃开展。技术革新、技术革命又大大促进了生产力的发展，有力地保证了煤炭生产任务的完成。
