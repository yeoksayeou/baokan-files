    Editor's Note: The experience of the "May 7th" Cadres School in Heilongjiang regarding the placement of cadres for labor is very good. It is suggested that comrades at all levels of the revolutionary committees and the broad masses of cadres and intellectuals read it carefully. We already have experience in streamlining organizations, and now with the experience of placing cadres for labor, our understanding of how to achieve the revolutionization of organs and cadres will be more comprehensive.

    Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The broad masses of cadres going down to labor is an excellent opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, everyone should do this. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." Chairman Mao's instruction has great significance for opposing revisionism and preventing revisionism, and for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. It should be highly regarded by all levels of revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses. It is hoped that the broad masses of cadres (except for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled), including those who have made mistakes, will follow Chairman Mao's instruction, learn anew during the process of going down to labor, and undergo a fairly thorough revolutionization of their spiritual outlook. Both old and new revolutionary cadres working in the revolutionary committees should also execute Chairman Mao's instruction, go down to labor in stages and batches, and not become detached from the laboring people. They should both be "officials" and be common people. New cadres should especially pay attention to not falling into the bad habits of the exploiting class, such as being detached from the masses, detached from labor, relying entirely on secretaries, and acting like officials and lords. They should maintain the vigorous revolutionary youth of the proletariat.

    According to a report from our newspaper, on May 7th of this year, the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee organized a large number of cadres from the organs to go down to labor. They established an agricultural farm in Liuhe County, Regong District, and named it the "May 7th" Cadres School, providing new experience for the revolutionization of organs and the reform of the superstructure that does not adapt to the socialist economic base.

    The number of people in the "May 7th" Cadres School has been increasing gradually. Currently, there are 504 students, mainly from the original provincial direct organs and the working staff of the provincial revolutionary committee.

    The "May 7th" Cadres School follows the path of integrating with workers and peasants, and is highly welcomed by the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants praise, "If the county and commune cadres were like the 'May 7th' cadres, that would be great. We need cadres who can go up and down, be both officials and common people, and be one-hearted with us." Many cadres from the organs, the People's Liberation Army, and students who have seen the "May 7th" Cadres School all unanimously agree: Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, to continue the revolution, one must follow the path indicated by the "May 7th" directive. "'May 7th' Cadres School is leading the way, and we must catch up."

    The "May 7th" Cadres School in Heilongjiang Province takes the task of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, transforming the worldview of cadres, and following the path of integrating with workers and peasants as its top priority. Many students say, "After coming to the 'May 7th' Cadres School, my thoughts have changed quickly. In the past, I was always educating others, but now I am being educated. The feeling is different, and the experience is different." During the Cultural Revolution, some cadres were criticized and developed a lot of resentment, lying down and refusing to work. They became "idlers," wanting to find a place with green mountains and clear waters to live a life of "rising with the sun and returning with the sunset" like in the Peach Blossom Spring. After coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School, the intense class struggle and hard labor life made the "idlers" no longer idle. They got up before the sun rose and returned home after the sun had set, which tempered them and began to touch their souls. An old cadre from the Anti-Japanese War period, who was a shepherd before joining the revolution, enjoyed high positions and wealth after the revolution's victory, and still thought he deserved to enjoy his leisure. This time, after coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School, he picked up the shepherd's whip he had not used for decades and felt deeply moved. He said, "How many shepherds and poor people are still not liberated in the world! How can I enjoy my leisure after the revolution's victory! Today, herding the sheep up the mountains and through the waters, the closer I walk, the closer I am to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the more I feel Chairman Mao's closeness." Some cadres who had been sitting in tall buildings for a long time, not knowing the seasons, were always depressed and empty-minded. After coming to the countryside, they breathed fresh air, and their stagnant air was blown away. They said, "After entering the 'May 7th' Cadres School, there are thousands of changes, ten thousand changes, but the deepest feeling is the change from a cadre to an ordinary laborer, from an official to a common person. This change truly touches the soul. No matter how high your position is, once you pick up the hoe and sickle, half of your official airs are gone."

    In the past, many "three-door" (from home to school to office) cadres rarely came into contact with the masses of workers and peasants. After coming to the "May 7th" Cadres School, they personally went to the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements, came into contact with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and strengthened their feelings for the laboring people. Some comrades deeply felt, "Long-term sitting in the office made my head empty, my legs weak, and I couldn't tell the difference between good and bad smells, or between friends and enemies. It was only after coming into contact with the poor and lower-middle peasants that I realized I was covered in dust and needed to wash it off!" Because the cadres' thoughts were transformed, the poor and lower-middle peasants also regarded them as their close friends. Some community members taught the cadres how to sow seeds hand in hand, and some community members ran from far away to help clear the land and build the school. This summer, when the river was blocked and the dam was built, the cadres went into the river and shivered all over. The local poor and lower-middle peasants saw this and immediately brought over rafts, quickly stopping the water and letting the cadres get to the shore. Many students were deeply moved.

    The "May 7th" Cadres School in Liuhe County, Heilongjiang Province, according to Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, cultivated more than 3,000 mu of land, developed agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries comprehensively, and self-reliantly established small factories and enterprises. Practice has proven that the "May 7th" Cadres School is a good place to transform and cultivate cadres, and a good way to achieve the revolutionization of organs and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Many comrades have already developed deep feelings for the "May 7th" Cadres School; some have brought their children who graduated from middle school to the school; some have voluntarily requested to bring their entire families to settle in the school. They say, "We came from production and today we return to production. The school is our home." For this reason, the school is building houses for them and preparing to welcome them. Currently, all the students of the "May 7th" Cadres School are advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. They are determined to transform and temper themselves into firm proletarian revolutionary fighters in the process of integrating with workers and peasants.

    柳河“五·七”干校为机关革命化提供了新的经验
    编者按：黑龙江“五·七”干校关于干部下放劳动的经验很好，建议各级革命委员会的同志们和广大干部、知识分子认真读一读。我们已经有了关于精简机构方面的经验，再加上关于干部下放劳动方面的经验，对如何实现机关革命化、干部革命化，认识就比较完整了。
    毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”毛主席的这个指示，对反修、防修，对搞好斗、批、改，有十分重大的意义，应引起我们各级革命干部和广大革命群众的高度重视。希望广大干部（除老弱病残者外），包括那些犯过错误的干部，遵照毛主席的指示，在下放劳动的过程中重新学习，使自己精神面貌来一个比较彻底的革命化。在革命委员会中工作的新老革命干部，也要执行毛主席的指示，分期分批下放劳动，使自己不脱离劳动人民，既当“官”，又当老百姓。新干部要特别注意不要染上脱离群众、脱离劳动、一切依靠秘书、做官当老爷的剥削阶级坏作风，要保持无产阶级朝气勃勃的革命的青春。
    本报讯　今年五月七日，黑龙江省革命委员会组织大批机关干部下放劳动，在庆安县柳河办了一所农场，定名“五·七”干校，为机关革命化，改革不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑提供了新的经验。
    “五·七”干校的人数是陆续增加的，现在共有学员五百零四人，主要是原省直属机关干部和省革命委员会的工作人员。
    “五·七”干校走与工农相结合的道路，深受广大贫下中农的欢迎。贫下中农称赞说：“要是县、公社的干部都象‘五·七’干部（社员们亲切称学员为‘五·七’干部）那就带劲了。我们就是需要这样能上能下、能‘官’能民、和咱们一条心的干部。”不少机关干部、解放军和学生看了“五·七”干校后，都一致认为：在无产阶级专政条件下要继续进行革命，就必须走“五·七”指示的道路。“‘五·七’干校走在前面了，我们要紧紧跟上。”
    黑龙江省“五·七”干校，把活学活用毛泽东思想，改造干部的世界观，走与工农相结合的道路作为头等任务来完成。不少学员说：“到了‘五·七’干校，思想上很快起了变化。过去总是教育人的，现在是受教育，心情不一样，感受也不同。”文化大革命中，有的干部挨了批判，产生了很多怨气，躺下不干了。他们甘当“逍遥派”，想找个山青水秀的地方，过着“日出而起，日落而归”的桃源生活。到了“五·七”干校后，激烈的阶级斗争和紧张的劳动生活，“逍遥派”不逍遥了。日没有出就起床，日已落还没归家，使他们受到了锻炼，开始触及了灵魂。一个抗日时期的老干部，参加革命前是放羊娃，革命胜利后，高官厚禄，养尊处优，还自认为功有应得，应当享受清福。这次到“五·七”干校后，他重新拿起几十年前的放羊鞭子，感慨尤深。他说：“天下还有多少放羊娃、穷苦人没有解放呵！我怎能革命胜利了就享清福呢！今天赶着羊群爬山涉水，越走离毛主席的革命路线越近，越走越觉毛主席亲。”有的过去长期蹲在大楼里，不闻春秋的干部，成天意志消沉，思想空虚。到农村后，呼吸了新鲜空气，暮气被打掉了。他们说：“进了‘五·七’干校，有千个变化，万个变化，感受最深的是由干部到普通劳动者、由‘官’到民这个变化。这个变化才真正触及了灵魂，不论你‘官’有多高，锄头镰刀一拿，官架子就打掉一大半了。”
    过去，不少“三门”（从家门到学校门，再到机关门）干部很少接近过工农群众，到了“五·七”干校后，亲临三大革命第一线，接近了贫下中农，增强了劳动人民的思想感情。有的同志深有体会地说：“长期蹲在机关，脑袋空虚，腿脚发软，香臭不辨，敌我不分。接触了贫下中农才发觉自己一身灰，不洗不行了！”由于干部的思想得到改造，贫下中农也把他们当成自己的贴心人。有的社员手把手地教干部撒种，有的社员从很远的地方跑来帮助开荒建校。今年夏天拦河筑坝时，干部下河冻得浑身发抖，当地贫下中农看见后，马上运来草筏，很快把水截住，让干部上了岸，很多学员深受感动。
    黑龙江省柳河“五·七”干校，按照毛主席的“五·七”指示，耕种三千余亩土地，农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，并自力更生办起了小型工厂企业。实践证明：“五·七”干校是改造和培养干部的好地方，是实现机关革命化，搞好斗批改的一种好办法。许多同志已经对“五·七”干校有了深厚的感情，有的把自己中学毕业的儿女带到了干校；有的主动要求把全家带到干校去落户。他们说：“我们是从生产中来的，今天又回到生产中去，干校就是我们的家。”为此，干校正在为他们修盖住房，准备迎接他们。目前，“五·七”干校全体学员正沿着毛主席指引的道路前进。他们决心在与工农相结合中，把自己改造锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士。
