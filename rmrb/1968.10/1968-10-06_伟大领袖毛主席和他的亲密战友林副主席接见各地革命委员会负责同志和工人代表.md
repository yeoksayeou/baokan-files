Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin smiled warmly as they met with the worker comrades.

Chairman Mao is heart to heart with the workers, and the working class is very close to Chairman Mao. Nearly ten thousand outstanding workers, who had been longing for their beloved great leader Chairman Mao day and night, were extremely excited to see him.

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Ye Qun, Wang Dongxing, and Wen Yucheng participated in the reception.

A Xinhua News Agency report dated October 5th stated: Our most beloved great teacher, great leader Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, along with Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Ye Qun, Wang Dongxing, and Wen Yucheng, tonight received responsible comrades from revolutionary committees and worker representatives from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions who are in Beijing to participate in the celebration of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin arrived at the Great Hall of the People, smiling warmly as they met with the worker comrades. At this moment, the entire hall erupted in cheers, with thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. Nearly ten thousand outstanding workers from all over the country, who had been longing for their beloved great leader Chairman Mao day and night, were extremely excited. They enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand long lives to Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Chairman Mao was very pleased and kept clapping and waving, greeting the worker representatives from all over the country who were striding onto the political stage of class struggle, criticism, and transformation with high spirits.

Chairman Mao is heart to heart with the workers, and the working class is very close to Chairman Mao. The workers being received waved the red revolutionary treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted enthusiastically to Chairman Mao. They shouted, "Loyal to Chairman Mao without limit! Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought without limit! Loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line without limit! 'Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought'! 'Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good soldier of Chairman Mao'! 'Follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously carry out class struggle, criticism, and transformation'! 'Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end'! 'Invincible Mao Zedong Thought, long live!' 'Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, long live!' 'The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, complete victory!' 'Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand long lives!' 'Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!'"

After the reception, the worker representatives and responsible comrades from revolutionary committees were still immersed in great happiness. They sang over and over again, "Beloved Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts. We have so many heartfelt words to tell you, we have so many passionate songs to sing for you..." Many workers couldn't help but dance to the song "Wish Chairman Mao Eternal Life." The Great Hall of the People was filled with joy.

Worker representatives from Shanghai, Tianjin, Hunan, and other places enthusiastically told reporters about their excitement at seeing Chairman Mao. They said, "We workers were oppressed and exploited in the old society. It was Chairman Mao who led us to revolt and saved us from the sea of suffering. We became the masters of the state. Chairman Mao instructed us: 'The working class must lead everything.' Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin personally approved our invitation to come to Beijing to participate in the national day celebrations, and today they received us. This is the greatest care and encouragement for the working class nationwide, and it is the greatest honor for the working class. They expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously carry out class struggle, criticism, and transformation, promote revolution and production, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and complete the great historical mission of the working class.

Many worker representatives, as soon as the reception ended, quickly rushed to the telecommunication building to tell their comrades the great news of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin receiving the worker representatives, so that their comrades could share this greatest happiness.
