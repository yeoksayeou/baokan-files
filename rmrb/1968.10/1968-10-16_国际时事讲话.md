International Current Affairs Speech

The New Peak of Combat Friendship Between Chinese and Albanian Peoples

In recent times, the most notable event on the international stage is the development of combat friendship and unity between the Chinese and Albanian parties and peoples to a new high in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the common struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

The leaders of the Albanian Party and state have sent warm and enthusiastic telegrams to our great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou, congratulating our country on the nationwide triumph of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and our National Day. The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, also delivered an important speech at the National Day reception held by the Chinese Embassy in Albania, highly praising the great victory of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In their replies to Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou expressed their warmest congratulations to the Albanian people for their ever more brilliant victories on the road of revolutionization, and expressed their resolute support for the revolutionary action of the People's Republic of Albania in withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact. They solemnly declared: "The 700 million Chinese people, tempered and made stronger in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will always stand firmly on the side of the brotherly Albanian people at all times and under all circumstances. If the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet modern revisionists, and their lackeys dare to touch a single hair of Albania, they will face nothing but a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure." This is a powerful warning and demonstration to the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and their accomplices, who are eyeing Albania like a tiger. All enemies of the Albanian people must reckon with the combined strength of China and Albania.

On the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a delegation led by Comrade Beqir Balluku from the Albanian Party and government, bearing the fraternal sentiments of the Albanian people, came to our country to celebrate the festival with us. Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin met with them several times, and Comrade Zhou Enlai and others had cordial talks with them. Both sides agreed that it is necessary to expand the common struggle against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys on a global scale.

China and Albania are two strong red fortresses standing on the continents of Asia and Europe. At a time when the struggle of the world's peoples against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is entering a new historical period, the closer unity and mutual support between the peoples of the two countries in their joint struggle have extremely great significance for the development of the current international situation.

The Tide of Anti-American Struggles Surges Worldwide

Recently, the anti-American struggles of the peoples of various countries have surged to new heights.

In the past ten days or so, a powerful anti-American revolutionary storm has swept across the Japanese archipelago. Workers, youth, students, and citizens in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and other places have launched fierce attacks against U.S. imperialism and the Sato reactionary government to smash the U.S.-Japan "security treaty," dismantle U.S. military bases, and block the transport of U.S. military supplies to Vietnam. The demonstrators, in the struggle, used stones to resist the bloody suppression by the police, once again demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Japanese revolutionary people who fear no violence and dare to fight.

Japan is a country that is semi-militarily occupied by the United States, but the anti-American struggle of the Japanese people has never stopped. Although the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries have recently intensified their suppression of the Japanese revolutionary mass movement, and the Miyamoto revisionist clique has done everything possible to sabotage and betray, the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people continues to surge forward. This shows that the contradictions between the Japanese people and U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are irreconcilable and will inevitably become sharper.

The island nation of the Philippines in the Pacific is also a place where U.S. imperialism has stationed a large number of troops and built many important U.S. military bases. From late September to early October, there were continuous large-scale anti-American parades and demonstrations by workers, youth, students, and teachers. The excited Filipino workers and students held up signs saying "Yankees go home!" and blocked the gates of the U.S. Clark Air Base, preventing U.S. troops from entering the base. Traffic near this base was once disrupted. The demonstrators also distributed declarations opposing U.S. military bases.

Of particular note is that in Mexico, right next to the southern United States, the flames of revolutionary mass movements have also been ignited. Mexico, which is tightly controlled by U.S. imperialism and has long been considered one of the more "quiet" countries in Latin America, saw the most intense student struggles in recent decades in early October, opposing U.S. colonialism and protesting police brutality and massacres. The struggle quickly spread to other major cities in the country. The angry students, fearless of bayonets and bullets, dared to fight and resist, showing tenacious revolutionary spirit. They had no weapons, so they threw stones and sticks at police cars; they had no fortresses, so they used burning cars as barricades to fight back bravely and persist in the struggle. The heroic and tenacious struggle of Mexican students has shaken the entire backyard of U.S. imperialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The surging tide of the people of the world against the U.S. aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will certainly win even greater victories." The development of the international situation fully confirms Chairman Mao's scientific judgment.

The Soviet Revisionist Clique Faces Even Greater Difficulties

After the Soviet revisionist clique sent troops to occupy Czechoslovakia, its situation has become even more difficult, and its days are even worse.

The tens of thousands of Soviet troops have not been able to subdue the Czechoslovak people. In various parts of Czechoslovakia, broad revolutionary masses have carried out various forms of struggle against the Soviet occupation, firmly demanding that the Soviet invading troops get out of Czechoslovakia! Around the world, the Soviet revisionists' barefaced act of aggression has been strongly condemned by the peoples of various countries, making them the target of universal criticism. At the same time, various big and small revisionists have expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet revisionists' actions, and their open and covert struggles have become increasingly fierce, causing the entire modern revisionist camp to disintegrate and fall into chaos. As a result, the counter-revolutionary black meeting, which the Soviet revisionists had planned to hold in November with great effort, had to be recently postponed. This incident once again made the Soviet revisionist clique look ridiculous and lose face in front of the whole world!

Originally, the Soviet revisionists' brazen invasion of Czechoslovakia was a desperate move. Now, they are in a situation where they cannot get off the tiger. It is precisely under these circumstances that the Soviet revisionists, in early October, summoned the Czechoslovak revisionist leaders to Moscow for so-called "talks," forcing the Czechoslovak revisionists to agree to the long-term occupation of Czechoslovakia by Soviet troops. The Soviet revisionists thought that by doing so, they could make their military occupation of Czechoslovakia "legalized" and get out of their extremely embarrassing situation. In fact, the opposite is true. This action has further exposed the ferocious face and weak essence of Soviet social imperialism. The Soviet revisionists' military occupation of Czechoslovakia is actually playing a role in mobilizing the Czechoslovak people and the people of the whole world to oppose the Soviet revisionists. The longer the Soviet invading troops stay there, the tighter the noose around their necks will be.

    国际时事讲话
    中阿人民战斗友谊的新高峰
    最近期间，国际上最令人注目的一件大事情，就是中阿两党和两国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中，在反帝反修的共同斗争中，战斗友谊和团结发展到了一个新的高峰。
    阿尔巴尼亚党和国家领导人，接连给我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席以及周总理发来了热情洋溢的贺电，祝贺我国全国山河一片红和祝贺我国国庆。阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志又在我国驻阿尔巴尼亚使馆举行的国庆招待会上发表了重要讲话，高度赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。毛主席、林副主席和周总理在给霍查同志和谢胡同志的复电中，最热烈地祝贺阿尔巴尼亚人民在革命化道路上取得越来越辉煌的胜利，并且对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国宣布退出华沙条约的革命行动，表示最坚决的支持，庄严宣告：“在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的七亿中国人民，在任何时候、任何情况下，都将始终如一地站在兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。如果美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其走狗胆敢动阿尔巴尼亚一根毫毛，等着他们的，只能是彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。”对于正在对阿尔巴尼亚虎视眈眈的苏修叛徒集团及其同伙们，这是一个有力的警告和示威。一切敌视阿尔巴尼亚人民的敌人，都必须把中国和阿尔巴尼亚的力量计算在一起。
    在中华人民共和国成立十九周年的时候，以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，怀着阿尔巴尼亚人民的兄弟情谊来到我国，同我们一起欢度佳节。我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席多次会见了他们，周恩来等同志和他们进行了亲切的会谈。双方一致认为，必须在世界范围内扩大反对美帝、苏修及其走狗的共同斗争。
    中国和阿尔巴尼亚是屹立在亚洲和欧洲大陆上的两个坚强的红色堡垒。在世界人民反对美帝、苏修的斗争正在进入一个新的历史时期的今天，中阿两国人民更加紧密地携起手来，互相支持，并肩战斗，这对当前国际形势发展具有极其重大的意义。
    各国人民反美浪潮汹涌澎湃
    最近，各国人民的反美斗争浪潮又有了新的高涨。
    近十几天来，强大的反美革命风暴席卷了日本列岛。东京、京都、大阪等地的工人、青年学生和市民，为了粉碎日美“安全条约”、拆除美国军事基地、阻止美军运输军需品到越南，向美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府发动了猛烈的进攻。示威群众在斗争中用石块抵抗警察的血腥镇压，又一次表现了日本革命人民不畏强暴、敢于斗争的英雄气概。
    日本是被美国半军事占领的国家，但日本人民的反美斗争从未停息过。尽管美日反动派最近变本加厉地加强了对日本革命群众运动的镇压，尽管宫本修正主义集团千方百计地进行破坏和叛卖，日本人民的反美爱国斗争的洪流仍然滚滚向前。这说明了，日本人民和美帝国主义及其走狗之间的矛盾是不可调和的，而且必然地会越来越尖锐化。
    太平洋上的群岛之国——菲律宾，同样是美帝国主义驻扎重兵，并建有许多重要美军基地的地方。从九月底到十月初，在那里也连日发生了工人、青年学生和教员的大规模反美游行示威。情绪激昂的菲律宾工人、学生，高举“美国佬滚回去！”的标语牌，封锁了美国克拉克空军基地的大门，不让美军进入基地。这个基地附近的交通曾经一度中断。示威群众还散发宣言，反对美国军事基地。
    尤其引起人们注意的是，在紧靠美国南部的墨西哥，也燃起了革命群众运动的怒火。墨西哥这个为美帝国主义所严密控制、一向被认为是拉丁美洲比较“平静”的国家，十月初发生了近几十年来最激烈的反对美国殖民主义、抗议警察当局镇压的反迫害、反屠杀的学生斗争。斗争很快蔓延到全国其他重要城市。愤怒的学生，不怕刺刀、枪弹，敢于斗争、敢于反抗，表现了顽强的革命精神。他们没有武器，就拿起石头、木棍扔向警车；没有碉堡，就用点燃的汽车做街垒，进行英勇的抵抗，坚持斗争。墨西哥学生的英勇顽强的斗争，震撼了整个美帝国主义的后院。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”国际形势的发展，完全证实了毛主席的这个科学论断。
    苏修叛徒集团日子更不好过
    苏修叛徒集团出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克以后，它的处境更加困难了，日子更加不好过了。
    苏修的几十万军队，并没有能够压服捷克斯洛伐克人民。在捷克斯洛伐克各地，广大革命群众进行了各种各样的反对苏修占领的斗争，他们坚决要求苏修侵略军队从捷克斯洛伐克滚出去！在全世界，苏修的赤裸裸侵略行动，遭到各国人民的强烈谴责，成为众矢之的。同时，一些大大小小的修正主义者也对苏修的做法表示不满，它们之间的明争暗斗越演越烈，整个现代修正主义集团分崩离析，一片混乱。这样一来，苏修费了九牛二虎之力策划的、预定在十一月召开的反革命黑会，不得不在最近宣告延期了。这件事，又一次使苏修叛徒集团在全世界大出丑，大丢脸！
    本来，苏修悍然出兵捷克斯洛伐克就是狗急跳墙。现在，它在捷克斯洛伐克又变成骑虎难下。正是在这种情况下，苏修在十月初又把捷修头目叫到莫斯科进行所谓“会谈”，逼迫捷修同意苏修军队长期占领捷克斯洛伐克。苏修自以为它用这种办法就可以使它对捷克斯洛伐克的军事占领“合法化”，就可以摆脱它的极端狼狈的处境。其实，适得其反。这样做，恰恰进一步暴露了苏修社会帝国主义的凶恶面目和虚弱本质。苏修对捷克斯洛伐克的军事占领，实际上起着动员捷克斯洛伐克人民和全世界人民反对苏修的作用。苏修的侵略军队赖在那里时间越长，套在它脖子上的绞索就要勒得越紧。
