The revolutionary committee of Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant in Hebei Province has, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions that "our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers," since April of this year, assigned 72% of the cadres to work in the workshops, teams, and groups. In-service cadres are also assigned to labor in batches. This measure has effectively brought cadres closer to the workers, begun to change the cadres' spiritual outlook, and vigorously promoted the development of the revolution and production.

Through practice, cadres have, together with the workers, studied and applied Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, participated in labor, and seen the workers' enthusiasm for labor, receiving profound education.

To re-educate the cadres, the plant revolutionary committee holds a meeting every month to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, organizing the assigned cadres to exchange experiences, find gaps, and learn from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses. Now, many of the assigned cadres in this plant have become the backbone of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" in the teams, and some have even been elected as team or group leaders. The masses praise them, saying, "They are truly good cadres educated by Chairman Mao."

The plant revolutionary committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, has also insisted on the system of assigning in-service cadres to labor in batches, promoting the thought reform of in-service cadres.

    石家庄热电厂干部分期分批下放劳动
    河北省石家庄热电  厂革命委员会，遵照毛主席的“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者”的教导，从今年四月份起，把百分之七十二的干部下放到车间、班、组参加劳动，在职干部也分期分批下放劳动。这个措施，有效地密切了干部与工人的关系，使干部的精神面貌开始发生变化，有力地促进了革命和生产的发展。
    干部们在实践中，通过和工人一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起参加劳动，看到工人群众的劳动热情，受到了深刻的教育。
    为了重新教育干部，厂革命委员会每月召开一次下放干部活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，组织下放干部交流经验，找出差距，取长补短。现在，这个厂的下放干部有许多已成为班组“抓革命，促生产”的骨干，有的人还被选为班、组长。群众赞扬他们说：“不愧是毛主席教导出来的好干部”。
    厂革委会遵照毛主席的教导，对在职干部也坚持了分期分批下放劳动的制度，促进了在职干部的思想革命化。
