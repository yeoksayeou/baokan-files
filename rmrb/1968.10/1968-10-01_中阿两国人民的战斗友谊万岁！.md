The delegation led by Comrade Bekir Balluku from the Albanian Party and Government, bearing the deep affection of the Albanian people, has come to our country to celebrate the festival with us. Workers in Beijing, like the people of the entire nation, are extremely excited and genuinely delighted by this, expressing their warmest welcome.

The Albanian people are heroic and upright. Under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great Marxist-Leninist, they are carrying out a revolutionary cause that shakes the heavens and the earth, achieving one glorious success after another. They fearlessly resist the encirclement by imperialism and modern revisionism, steadfastly walk the socialist path, rely on their own strength, strive for self-improvement, and have transformed their country from a backward agricultural nation into an advanced socialist country. With an unyielding revolutionary spirit, they launch a vigorous revolutionization movement to prevent the restoration of capitalism and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. They raise the banner of opposing modern revisionism, resolutely fight against the Soviet revisionist clique, the Tito clique, and various kinds of traitors, and bravely defend Marxism-Leninism. They raise the banner of opposing imperialism, resolutely oppose the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, and support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. The Albanian Party of Labor and the Albanian people have made outstanding contributions to the international communist movement and the world revolutionary cause. We, the Chinese people, are deeply proud to have such comrades-in-arms.

In Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction, the Albanian working class has always been at the forefront. The Albanian worker comrades, on the path of revolutionization, resolutely wage class struggle while selflessly working hard to promote the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, creating more wealth for their country. Under the slogan of "one hand with a pickaxe, one hand with a gun," they bravely defend their socialist motherland. Heroes like Adam Reka, Muho Hoxha, Muho Kape, and Shkurt Vata, who have emerged in the socialist revolution and construction, vividly demonstrate the great revolutionary spirit and noble communist qualities of the Albanian working class. This year, the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, proposed strengthening the supervision of the working class. The Albanian working class, by implementing this guiding directive, will further promote the development of the revolutionization movement and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat in Albania.

The recent announcement by the People's Republic of Albania to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact once again demonstrates the firm revolutionary stance and fearless heroism of the Albanian Party of Labor and the Albanian people. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people firmly support this revolutionary action of our Albanian brothers.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said, "Though China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected." In the common cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the common struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, the two parties and the peoples of China and Albania have always supported each other and marched forward side by side. Our revolutionary, combat-friendly unity and solidarity have withstood the severe tests of storms and tempests. Under any circumstances, the peoples of China and Albania will forever stand together, fight together, and win together.

The Soviet revisionist clique and its accomplices have recently intensified their attacks and threats against the People's Republic of Albania. However, this will never intimidate the heroic Albanian people. The Albanian people have made all necessary preparations to defend their motherland and will give a crushing blow to any enemy who dares to invade. The Chinese people stand firmly with the Albanian people. All true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples around the world stand firmly with the Albanian people. All reactionaries who dare to bang their heads against the iron wall of Albania will surely be smashed to pieces.

    中阿两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    北京市工代会
    以贝基尔·巴卢库同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，满载着阿尔巴尼亚人民的深情厚谊到我国来同我们共度佳节。北京的工人和全国人民一样，为此感到无比的兴奋和由衷的喜悦，表示最热烈的欢迎。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是顶天立地的英雄人民。他们在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，进行着惊天动地的革命事业，并取得了一个又一个辉煌的成就。他们不怕帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围，坚持走社会主义道路，自力更生，奋发图强，把自己的祖国从一个落后的农业国变为一个先进的社会主义国家。他们本着不断革命的精神，开展轰轰烈烈的革命化运动，防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政。他们高举反对现代修正主义的旗帜，同苏修叛徒集团、铁托集团和形形色色的工贼进行坚决斗争，英勇地捍卫马克思列宁主义。他们高举反对帝国主义的旗帜，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，支持各国人民的革命斗争。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，对于国际共产主义运动和世界革命事业，作出了杰出的贡献。我们中国人民以有这样的战友，深深地感到骄傲。
    阿尔巴尼亚的工人阶级在阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，一贯站在最前列。阿尔巴尼亚的工人弟兄，在革命化的大道上，一面坚决地开展阶级斗争，一面以忘我的劳动积极开展增产节约运动，为祖国创造更多的财富。他们在“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的口号下，英勇地捍卫着自己的社会主义祖国。在社会主义革命和建设中涌现出来的亚当·雷卡、穆·希胡、穆·凯皮、什库塔·瓦塔等许多英雄人物，突出地表现出了阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级伟大的革命精神和高尚的共产主义品质。今年上半年，阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志提出加强工人阶级的监督。阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级贯彻这一纲领性的指示，必将进一步推动革命化运动的发展，进一步巩固阿尔巴尼亚的无产阶级专政。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国最近宣布退出华沙条约，再一次表现了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民坚定的革命立场和大无畏的英雄气概。我们中国工人阶级和中国人民坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚兄弟的这一革命行动。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说过：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”我们中阿两党和两国人民，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同事业中，在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的共同斗争中，一贯相互支持，并肩前进。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊和团结，是经历过急风暴雨的严峻考验的。在任何情况下，中阿两国人民都将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    苏修叛徒集团及其同伙最近加紧了对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的攻击和威胁。但是，这是绝对吓不倒英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的。阿尔巴尼亚人民已为保卫自己的祖国作好了必要准备，随时给予敢于侵犯的敌人以迎头痛击。中国人民坚决站在阿尔巴尼亚人民一边，全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民坚决站在阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。一切反动派，胆敢拿自己的脑袋往阿尔巴尼亚的铜墙铁壁上碰，必然要碰得粉身碎骨。
