The Shenyang Fifth Third Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, led the entire factory's revolutionary workers to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great directive to thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform. They focused on the fundamentals, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's spiritual outlook. They carried out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, using revolutionary criticism to drive all work forward, and the revolutionary and production situation is excellent.

How to determine if the criticism is deep and the reform is good?

The Fifth Third Factory Revolutionary Committee believes: First, see if the masses have truly been mobilized; second, see if people's ideological revolutionization has been strengthened, that is, mainly see if the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been raised.

Their criticism was gradually deepened. Initially, there were more large meetings and fewer small meetings; more general content and less specific content; more listeners and fewer speakers; more copying and less personal exposure and accusation. Therefore, the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line could not be eliminated. Later, they learned from the advanced experience of other factories, shifting from large meetings to specialized criticism, on-site criticism, and mobile criticism in workshops and teams.

In the criticism, using the factory's capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" as live materials, everyone exposed and criticized together, greatly raising the revolutionary workers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. For example, during the specialized criticism of the factory's capitalist roaders promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "material incentives" and "bonus leadership" by the Chinese Khrushchev, a worker said: "In the past, I was blinded by the capitalist roaders' money, forgetting the power of the proletariat; now, after criticizing money, I have established power." Through the revolutionary criticism, they hated the capitalist roaders more and more, loved socialism more and more, and were more loyal to Chairman Mao. The broad masses of workers voluntarily studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and the entire factory launched a new wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions without delay, studied without omission, and executed without deviation.

During the struggle, criticism, and reform process, the factory revolutionary committee realized: To criticize deeply, the revolutionary committee's leadership must become the command center for struggle, criticism, and reform, and firmly grasp the fundamentals without deviation. The revolutionary committee members are both fighters and commanders. Now, the revolutionary committee and the workers' congress hold one to two criticism meetings per week, and also go deep into the workshops and teams to carry out revolutionary criticism with the worker masses, discover good examples, summarize and promote them in a timely manner, and effectively promote the development of revolutionary criticism.

Now, the Fifth Third Factory has achieved weekly planning and daily criticism meetings. The more they criticize, the more energetic they become, with everyone speaking up and everyone participating, fully mobilizing the masses. The revolutionary committee deeply felt in the practice of struggle, criticism, and reform: To establish, one must "break"; only by breaking can one establish; to reform, one must criticize; only by criticizing can one reform; criticize deeply to reform well, and if the criticism is not good, the reform will not be successful.

Change People First, Then Things

In the great struggle, criticism, and reform, where should the focus of reform be placed? Struggle, criticism, and reform is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, according to the image of the proletariat, to carry out a thorough and universal reform of all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base. The reform itself is also a fierce struggle between two ideologies, two classes, and two lines. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches people's souls, aiming to solve the problem of people's worldview. The factory revolutionary committee, in the practice of struggle, criticism, and reform, continuously studied Mao Zedong Thought and realized: The first and foremost task of reform is to change people, to arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and to promote people's ideological revolutionization. This is the fundamental way to prevent and guard against revisionism and consolidate the socialist system. If this fundamental aspect is forgotten and only things are changed, it will still revert to the old ways.

In the criticism, the worker comrades, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon and facts as their basis, fiercely exposed and criticized the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," eliminating their poison. The workers said: None of the past innovations were achieved by the reactionary technical "authorities." In the on-site criticism meetings, the workers presented the products and asked these "authorities" to identify them. The "authorities" confused copper for iron and iron for copper, could not distinguish between copper and iron, and did not even understand the production process. The workers angrily said: "They are truly good-for-nothings!" This criticism greatly boosted the morale of the working class and crushed the arrogance of the reactionary technical "authorities." The workers said: "Without these people, the earth still rotates. We, the working class, are the true masters of science, and we must occupy this position." The more they criticized, the more they hated the capitalist roaders; the more they criticized, the more they felt that the working class must lead everything. Everyone solemnly swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! With your support, we will definitely make you proud!" Under the great inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers decided to reform the technical innovation projects that had been suppressed by the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" for ten years, such as eliminating the wrapping iron in copper-clad steel and electroplating the finished product with copper. Originally, the production process for eliminating the wrapping iron in copper-clad steel required workers to use wooden hammers to tightly hammer the iron sheets wrapping the copper-clad steel on all sides. Some workers' palms were swollen, and their fingers were injured. Each person had to move more than eight tons of copper-clad steel materials daily, making the production process very slow. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the workers proposed rationalization suggestions for innovation, which were suppressed by the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities." Over the past ten years, the wasted wrapping iron sheets were worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. After eliminating the wrapping iron, forty-five laborers were saved, and the wealth they could create is immeasurable. In the revolutionary criticism, the worker comrades, with their deep hatred for the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" and the strong sense of responsibility of the working class, conquered this technical fortress in just five days. Eliminating the wrapping iron in copper-clad steel opened up a new path for hot rolling automation.

In every specialized criticism, the Fifth Third Factory Revolutionary Committee focused on raising people's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, firmly grasping people's ideological revolutionization.

Continuous Criticism Leads to Continuous Reform

In the struggle, criticism, and reform, is it enough to criticize and reform once? No! In a society with classes, class struggle will not end. In a classless society, the struggle between new and old, right and wrong, will never end. After learning Chairman Mao's great teachings, the Fifth Third Factory Revolutionary Committee deeply felt: Revolutionary criticism must run through the entire process of struggle, criticism, and reform. Only by continuously criticizing can one continuously reform, finding the targets for reform from the criticism, and determining the content of criticism from the needs of reform. "Break first, then establish."

Through a deep criticism of the "two big laws" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, they thoroughly criticized "material incentives," "profit leadership," "one-man management," "expert management," and "technology first." The workers quickly raised their awareness and said: The "two big laws," weighing four jin four liang, with thirty-six thousand characters, advocate money and emphasize the authority of officials at all levels, but never mention the five shining golden words of Mao Zedong Thought. The "two big laws" are black laws for restoring capitalism. Through the criticism, they firmly established the five fundamental principles of the "Anshan Constitution": insisting on political leadership, strengthening party leadership, launching mass movements, implementing two participations and one reform and three combinations, and launching technological revolutions.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee in the mobile workshop, they adopted methods such as "reducing" and "merging," reducing the number of management personnel by thirty-five percent. Later, they further implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "reform state organs, the most fundamental of which is to connect with the masses," criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of political power construction, and had the revolutionary committee members work in shifts, soliciting the masses' opinions. They further implemented streamlining and downsizing, reducing personnel by eighty-two percent.

Recently, after Chairman Mao's latest instruction on "a large number of cadres going down to the countryside to labor, this is a good opportunity for cadres to re-learn, except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches" was issued, they criticized the revisionist thought of "acting like officials and lords." The revolutionary committee decided to send twelve percent of the personnel to work in shifts in the teams.

The reform of the organization is like this, and the reform of technology is also like this, continuously criticizing and continuously reforming. They criticized the reactionary technical "authorities" through criticism, liberated their minds, and unleashed the enthusiasm and creativity of the revolutionary workers.

After achieving the major innovation of eliminating the wrapping iron in copper-clad steel and replacing it with a stainless steel box, they continued to criticize the reactionary technical "authorities" for seeking large and foreign things, and achieved the technological innovation of replacing the stainless steel box with a stainless steel plate. After the major innovation in copper-clad steel production, the electroplating of the finished product was also successfully experimented with, replacing the production of the finished product with copper-clad steel and creating new processes.

They combined revolutionary criticism with the cleanup of class ranks, with struggle, criticism, and reform, with promoting revolution and production, and with solving people's active thoughts in class struggle. Therefore, the criticism has content, and problems are solved after the criticism.

After the establishment of the Fifth Third Factory Revolutionary Committee, due to the deep and sustained revolutionary criticism and the focus on people's ideological revolutionization, they have taken solid steps on the path of struggle, criticism, and reform. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and resolutely fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and reform.

    破字当头，立也就在其中了
    ——沈阳五三工厂革委会在斗、批、改中的几点体会
    沈阳五三工厂革命委员会，在解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，带领全厂革命职工，坚决落实毛主席认真搞好斗、批、改的伟大指示，狠抓根本，用毛泽东思想改变人的精神面貌，深入持久地开展革命大批判，以革命大批判推动各项工作，革命、生产形势一片大好。
    批得深才能改得好
    怎样算批得深，改得好呢？
    五三工厂革命委员会认为：一看群众是否真正发动起来了；二看是否加强了人的思想革命化，即主要看是否提高了人的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    他们的大批判是逐步深入的。开始是大会多，小会少；综合性内容多，专题内容少；听会的多，发言的少；转抄的多，自己揭发、控诉的少。因此，反革命修正主义路线流毒不能肃清。后来，他们学习兄弟厂的先进经验，由大会批判转入到车间、班组为单位的专题批判、现场批判、流动批判。
    在批判中，以厂内走资派、反动技术“权威”为活材料，大家一起揭发批判，大大提高了革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。如在批判厂内走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫的“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”反革命修正主义路线专题时，有个工人说：“过去我迷了走资派的钱，忘了无产阶级的权；现在批臭了钱，树立了权。”通过革命大批判，他们越恨走资派，越热爱社会主义，越忠于毛主席。广大工人自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，全厂掀起了一个群众性的活学活用毛泽东思想新高潮。他们对毛主席最新指示，宣传不过夜，学习不漏人，执行不走样。
    在斗、批、改过程中，厂革委会认识到：要批得深，革委会领导班子必须成为斗、批、改的战斗指挥部，狠抓根本不转向。革委会成员既是战斗员，又是指挥员。现在，革委会和工代会每周都开一至二次批判会，还深入车间、班组，同工人群众一起搞大批判，发现好的典型，及时总结，及时推广，有力地推动了革命大批判的开展。
    现在，五三工厂已做到每周有安排，天天有批判会，越批越有劲，人人开口，个个上阵，群众充分发动起来。革委会在斗、批、改的实践中深深地体会到：要立必须“破”，只有破才能立；要改必须批，只有批才能改；批得深，才能改得好，批不好，就改不了。
    改物先改人
    在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，改的着眼点放在哪里呢？斗、批、改就是以毛泽东思想为武器，按照无产阶级的面貌，对一切不适合社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，实行彻底的、普遍的改革。改的本身，也是两种思想、两个阶级、两条路线的一场激烈的搏斗。无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是要解决人们的世界观问题。厂革委会在斗、批、改实践中，不断学习毛泽东思想，认识到：改，首要的，第一位的是改人，用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，促进人的思想革命化。这是反修、防修，巩固社会主义制度的根本。如果忘掉了这个根本，光从物上改，转来转去，还会复旧。
    在批判中，工人同志以毛泽东思想为武器，以事实为依据，狠揭猛批了走资派和反动技术“权威”，肃清他们的流毒。工人说：过去的革新成果，没有一项是反动技术“权威”搞成的。在现场批判会上，工人拿出产品叫这些家伙识别，“权威”老爷们指铜为铁，指铁为铜，铜铁不分，连生产工序都不清楚。工人们气得说：“真是饭桶！”这种批判大长了工人阶级志气，大灭了反动技术“权威”的威风。工人说：“没有这些家伙，地球照样转。我们工人阶级才是科学的主人，我们一定要占领这个阵地。”他们越批，对走资派越恨；越批，越感到工人阶级必须领导一切。大家站在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家为我们撑腰，我们一定给您老人家争气！”在毛泽东思想的巨大鼓舞下，工人们决定动手改革被走资派和反动技术“权威”压制了十年的复铜钢取消包扎铁和成品镀铜等技术革新项目。原来复铜钢取消包扎铁的生产工序，工人要用木锤把四周包扎复铜钢的铁皮敲打得十分严密，有的工人的手虎口被震肿，手指被砸伤，每人每天要搬动八吨多重的复铜钢材，生产进度非常缓慢。一九五八年大跃进中，工人就提出过革新的合理化建议，被走资派和反动技术“权威”压了下来。十年来，浪费的包扎铁皮价值一百几十万元。工人们取消包扎铁后，节省了四十五名劳动力，这些劳动力所能创造出的财富，更是难以计算。在革命大批判中，工人同志带着对走资派和反动技术“权威”的无比仇恨，和工人阶级强烈的主人翁责任感，仅用五天时间就攻克了这个技术堡垒。复铜钢取消包扎铁，为热轧自动化开创了新途径。
    在进行每一个专题批判当中，五三工厂革委会都把着眼点放在提高人的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟上，狠抓人的思想革命化。
    不断地批才能不断地改
    在斗、批、改中，是不是批一批就差不多了，改一改就可以了呢？否！在有阶级存在的社会内，阶级斗争不会完结。在无阶级存在的社会内，新与旧、正确与错误之间的斗争永远不会完结。五三工厂革委会学习毛主席这一伟大教导后，深深体会到：革命大批判必须贯穿斗、批、改的始终。只有不断地批，才能不断地改，从批的当中，找出改的目标，又从改的需要出发，确定批的内容，“破字当头，立也就在其中了”。
    通过深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人搞的“两本大法”，大破“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”、“一长制”、“专家治厂”、“技术第一”，工人们迅速提高了觉悟。他们气愤地说：“两本大法”，四斤四两重，三十六万字，鼓吹的是钱，强调的是各级干部的职权，就是找不到毛泽东思想五个金光闪闪的大字。“两本大法”是复辟资本主义的黑法。通过大批判，大立“鞍钢宪法”的五项基本原则：坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，实行两参一改三结合，大搞技术革命。
    机动车间在成立革命委员会后，采取“减”、“并”等办法，管理人员仅仅减少百分之三十五。后来他们进一步落实毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的指示，批判反革命修正主义政权建设路线，革委会成员跟班劳动，征求群众意见，又进一步实行了精兵简政，人员减少百分之八十二。
    最近，毛主席“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动”的最新指示发表后，他们又批判了“做官当老爷”的修正主义思想。革委会决定，分期分批地抽出百分之十二的人员下放班组劳动。
    机构改革是这样，技术改革也是这样，不断批，不断改。他们通过批判反动技术“权威”，解放了思想，发挥了革命职工的积极性和创造性。
    他们实现复铜钢取消包扎铁，代之以不锈钢盒的重大革新后，继续批判反动技术“权威”贪大求洋的言行，又实现了以不锈钢板代替不锈钢盒的技术革新。在复铜钢生产有了重大革新后，成品镀铜又实验成功了，代替用复铜钢生产成品，创造出新工艺。
    他们把革命大批判与清理阶级队伍结合起来，与斗、批、改结合起来，与抓革命促生产结合起来，与解决人们在阶级斗争中的活思想结合起来。因此，批有内容，批后解决问题。
    五三工厂革委会成立后，由于深入持久地开展革命大批判，大抓人的思想革命化，在斗、批、改的道路上，步子迈得扎实。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决打好斗、批、改这一仗。
