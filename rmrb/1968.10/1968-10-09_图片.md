The crew of the 60th train on the Changchun-Beijing railway line have resolutely reformed the irrational regulations in their work, turning the train into a red train that propagates Mao Zedong Thought. They have truly served the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the crew expressing their heartfelt wishes for the long life of the great leader Chairman Mao before the train departs!
