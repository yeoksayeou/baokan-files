The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Jinzhou Middle School in Liaoning Province, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, has united and relied on the active elements among the school's teachers, students, and staff to mobilize all positive factors to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school.

The New China News Agency, Shenyang, October 26th - The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class, the participation of the working masses, and the cooperation of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. They must combine with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, to form a revolutionary tripartite alliance."

The workers and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great directive, have united and relied on the active elements among the teachers, students, and staff of Jinzhou Middle School. They have fully mobilized their enthusiasm and promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school.

For a long time, Jinzhou Middle School was a notorious "difficult-to-handle" unit in Jinzhou City, with severe anarchist tendencies. Many students did not attend school without reason. After the workers' propaganda team entered the school, together with the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team that was already there, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings. They first went deep into this "difficult-to-handle" school's "difficult-to-handle" class to conduct investigations and research. The attendance of students in this class was only half, and those who came were physically present but mentally absent. The revolutionary criticism was cold and quiet. The workers and soldiers of the propaganda team, in light of the specific situation of this class, on the one hand, propagated Chairman Mao's latest directives to the revolutionary teachers and students and educated them with Mao Zedong Thought; on the other hand, they conducted in-depth and detailed ideological work, fully mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the active elements in the class. The workers and soldiers of the propaganda team, along with the active elements in the class, formed a "tripartite alliance" group to carry out extensive ideological education among all the students in the class. They actively sought out students for heart-to-heart talks, conducted class education on remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness, and visited their families. After a series of such efforts, all 48 students in the class, except for one who was sick, returned to school. The revolutionary criticism became lively and vigorous, and a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation was initiated.

The changes in this class made the workers and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team realize more deeply that Chairman Mao's great directive on "combining with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end to form a revolutionary tripartite alliance" has extremely important significance for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school. The active elements in the school understand the actual situation of the school the best. Under the leadership of the working class, they will definitely be able to achieve new successes in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and combining the workers and soldiers who have entered the school with the active elements in the school can the proletarian educational revolution be carried through to the end.

To fully mobilize the active elements among the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, the workers and soldiers of the propaganda team focused on educating and cultivating the active elements. They organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, guiding the active elements to study Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and directives on carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, as well as his series of directives on the educational revolution. The workers and soldiers of the propaganda team also helped the active elements carry out activities of recalling and comparing the old society's bitterness with the new society's sweetness; recalling the bitterness of the revisionist educational line and thinking of the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. On this basis, they organized everyone to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Through these activities, the proletarian consciousness and the consciousness of the two-line struggle of the active elements were greatly enhanced.

The workers and soldiers of the propaganda team paid great attention to the active thoughts of the active elements, arming them with the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, helping them to change their worldview, and promoting their ideological transformation. One active element went to do ideological work with a student who was deceived by the capitalist roaders, but was rejected three times in a row. After encountering this setback, his mood became a bit depressed, and he wanted to give up. The propaganda team members seized this active thought, had a heart-to-heart talk with him in time, encouraged him to overcome difficulties with Chairman Mao's teachings, and to establish the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution. They helped him to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, guiding him to examine the cause of wanting to give up from the perspective of worldview. After doing this, this active element raised his political consciousness and regained his enthusiasm for work. He patiently helped that deceived student return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The workers and soldiers of the propaganda team also continuously educated them with the policies of the proletariat, cultivating them to not only dare to revolutionize but also to be good at revolutionizing. Several students made serious mistakes during the Cultural Revolution. The active elements did a lot of work with them, but they still did not realize their mistakes. Some active elements got impatient and said, "Even if you chop a wooden head three times, there will still be a hole! If he himself does not stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, what use is it for us to do more work?" In response to this situation, the workers and soldiers of the propaganda team organized the active elements to study Chairman Mao's great teachings on "policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the party," educating them to strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions. After the active elements raised their awareness, they conducted patient and detailed ideological work with the deceived students, making the deceived students realize their mistakes and expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of the capitalist roaders. In this way, they united the majority of revolutionary teachers and students in the school and isolated a handful of class enemies.

Under the education and help of the workers and soldiers of the propaganda team, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the active elements among the teachers, students, and staff of this school have been greatly enhanced. They, under the leadership of the working class, consciously accept the re-education of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and actively take the lead in participating in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school. Every time Chairman Mao's latest directives are issued, they study them seriously, propagate them enthusiastically, and implement them resolutely. They, in order to propagate Chairman Mao's latest directives, did not eat or sleep, and formed propaganda teams overnight to propagate to the revolutionary teachers and students through performances, broadcasts, and writing slogans. After Chairman Mao's directive on re-educating intellectuals was issued, they took the lead in exposing their private thoughts and fiercely criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev against the students' path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The active elements in the graduating class took the lead in signing up to go to the countryside, to the border areas, and to the most difficult places. In the revolutionary criticism and the work of cleaning up the class ranks, these active elements were always at the forefront of the battle. For example, the teachers' study class organized by the school, due to some teachers being deeply poisoned by the revisionist educational line, the criticism did not hit the mark, and the work of cleaning up the class ranks progressed slowly. After the active elements discovered this situation, they actively went to this study class and, together with the revolutionary teachers, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, linked them to reality, and fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, exposing the hidden class enemies, making the study class lively and vigorous, and the revolutionary criticism and the work of cleaning up the class ranks quickly developed.

The workers and soldiers of the propaganda team stationed at Jinzhou Middle School, by uniting and relying on the active elements among the teachers, students, and staff of the school, fully mobilized their revolutionary enthusiasm, making the school's appearance completely changed. At present, the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary tripartite alliance of this school have been further consolidated and developed, the revolutionary criticism has been carried out vigorously, and the work of cleaning up the class ranks has been deeply developed. All the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the school are determined, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

    驻锦州中学工人毛泽东思想宣传队遵循毛主席的伟大教导
    团结和依靠学校师生员工中的积极分子  调动一切积极因素搞好学校的斗批改
    新华社沈阳二十六日电　伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。”进驻辽宁省锦州中学的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队遵照毛主席这一伟大指示，团结和依靠学校师生员工中的积极分子，充分调动他们的积极性，推动了学校的斗、批、改。
    锦州中学在很长一段时间里是锦州市出名的“老大难”单位，无政府主义思潮很严重，不少学生无故不到校。工人宣传队进校后，和原来在校的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队一起，遵照毛主席的教导，首先深入到这个“老大难”学校的“老大难”班，进行调查研究。这个班的学生到校人数仅有一半，来了的也是人在校，心在外，革命大批判搞得冷冷清清。工人、解放军宣传队针对这个班的具体情况，一方面向革命师生宣传毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想教育他们；另一方面，进行深入细致的思想工作，充分发挥班里积极分子的革命积极性。工人、解放军同志和班里的积极分子组成“三结合”小组，在全班同学中广泛开展思想教育工作。他们主动找同学谈心，对同学进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育，并作家庭访问。经过这一系列工作，全班四十八名同学，除一人有病外，全部回到学校，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。
    这个班的变化，使工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队更加深刻地认识到，毛主席关于“同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合”的伟大指示，对搞好学校的斗、批、改有着极其重要的意义。学校中的积极分子最了解学校的实际，他们在工人阶级领导下发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，一定能够在斗、批、改中再立新功。只有按照毛主席的教导，进驻学校的工人、解放军同志同学校中的积极分子相结合，才能把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
    为了充分发挥革命师生员工中积极分子的作用，工人、解放军宣传队的同志狠抓了对积极分子的教育和培养。他们举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织积极分子学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，以及关于教育革命的一系列指示。工人、解放军宣传队同志还帮助积极分子开展回忆对比的活动，忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜；忆修正主义教育路线的苦，思毛主席无产阶级教育路线的甜。在这个基础上，组织大家狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线。通过这些活动，大大提高了积极分子的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    工人、解放军宣传队十分注意针对积极分子的活思想，用无产阶级的彻底革命精神武装他们，帮助他们改造世界观，促进思想革命化。有个积极分子，去做一个受走资派蒙蔽的同学的思想工作，一连三次都被顶回来了。他碰了钉子后情绪有些低沉，想撂挑子不干了。宣传队的同志抓住了这个活思想，及时和他谈心，用毛主席的教导鼓励他排除困难，树立无产阶级的彻底革命精神，帮助他斗私批修，引导他从世界观上检查想撂挑子的原因。这样做了以后，这个积极分子提高了政治觉悟，工作劲头又足了。他耐心地帮助那个受蒙蔽的同学回到了毛主席的革命路线上来。
    工人、解放军宣传队还不断地用无产阶级的政策教育他们，培养他们不仅敢于革命，而且善于革命。有几个学生在文化大革命中犯了严重错误，积极分子对他们做了不少工作，但他们仍然认识不到自己的错误。有的积极分子急了，说：“木头脑袋砍三刀还有个口子呢！他自己不往毛主席革命路线上站，我们再做工作又有什么用？”针对这种情况，工人、解放军宣传队组织积极分子学习毛主席关于“政策和策略是党的生命”的伟大教导，教育他们严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。积极分子提高认识以后，对受蒙蔽的同学进行耐心细致的思想工作，使受蒙蔽的同学认识了自己的错误，并且揭发了走资派的反革命罪行。这样就团结了全校大多数革命师生，孤立了一小撮阶级敌人。
    这个学校师生员工中的积极分子在工人、解放军宣传队的教育和帮助下，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟有了很大提高，他们在工人阶级领导下，自觉接受工农兵的再教育，积极带头参加学校的斗、批、改。每当毛主席最新指示一发表，他们就认真学习，热情宣传，坚决贯彻。他们为了宣传毛主席的最新指示，饭不吃，觉不睡，连夜组成宣传队，通过演出文艺节目、广播、写标语等形式，向广大革命师生进行宣传。毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的指示发表后，他们带头亮私斗私，带头狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反对学生走同工农兵相结合道路的滔天罪行。毕业班的积极分子带头报名到农村去，到边疆去，到最艰苦的地方去。在革命大批判、清理阶级队伍工作中，这些积极分子都站在战斗的最前列。例如，学校办的教师学习班，由于有些教师受修正主义教育路线的毒害较深，大批判批不到点上，清理阶级队伍工作进展缓慢。积极分子发现这个情况以后，主动到这个学习班里去，和革命教师一起活学活用毛主席著作，联系实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，揭露了隐藏的阶级敌人，使学习班办得生气勃勃，革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作迅速开展起来。
    进驻锦州中学的工人、解放军宣传队，由于团结和依靠学校师生员工中的积极分子，充分发挥他们的革命积极性，使这个学校的面貌焕然一新。目前，这个学校的革命大联合和革命三结合得到了进一步的巩固和发展，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，清理阶级队伍的工作深入发展。全校广大革命师生员工决心在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，认真搞好斗、批、改，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
