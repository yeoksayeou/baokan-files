The armed forces of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, established two years ago within Angola, have focused on mobilizing the masses, strengthening political work, and persisting in armed struggle. After two years of arduous and tortuous battles, they are currently active in the eastern and southeastern regions of Angola, including Lunda, Moxico, and Cuando-Cubango. They have penetrated deep into the heart of these regions, such as Kuito, Upper Kuito, Cangamba, and Serpa Pinto, continuously striking at the enemy.

According to the battle reports of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, from the beginning of this year to the end of May, this patriotic armed force annihilated over 250 Portuguese colonial soldiers and captured one colonial military officer.

Serpa Pinto in the Cuando-Cubango region and Luso in the Moxico region are important strongholds of the Portuguese colonial forces. It is reported that the South African mercenary army in Luso trains colonial soldiers for Portugal and commands the colonial forces suppressing the patriotic armed forces in eastern Angola. The guerrilla forces of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola have launched continuous and fierce attacks on these two strongholds.

In the northeastern region of Serpa Pinto, the guerrillas annihilated 46 enemy soldiers in October last year; in November, they ambushed a Portuguese colonial force, annihilating 52 enemy soldiers; at the beginning of this year, they annihilated 9 more enemy soldiers and captured one colonial military officer.

The guerrillas also destroyed an enemy military vehicle near Luso in February, annihilating 30 enemy soldiers on the vehicle.

This patriotic armed force has established local militias in places such as Bunda, General Machado City, Serpa Pinto, and Luso to support the fighting.

The troops in these regions are almost entirely equipped with weapons and supplies seized from the Portuguese, many of which were provided by the North Atlantic aggression bloc led by the United States.

The growing guerrilla forces have also penetrated into the western and northern regions still controlled by the Portuguese colonial forces, mobilizing the masses, strengthening political work, training the army, and establishing local militia organizations.

	An Angolan guerrilla unit, using the jungle as their base, continually attacks Portuguese colonial military camps and patrols, achieving victory after victory. This is a guerrilla unit active in the jungle region.

    大力发动群众　加强政治工作　建立民兵武装
    安哥拉爱国武装四出活动打击敌人
    据新华社讯　两年前在安哥拉境内建立的争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟爱国武装力量，注意在国内发动群众，加强政治工作，坚持武装斗争，经过两年来艰苦曲折的战斗历程，目前正活跃在安哥拉东北部和东南部的隆达、莫西哥和宽多—库班哥等地区，深入到上述地区的心腹地带库维图、上库维图、坎甘巴和塞尔帕平托等地，不断打击敌人。
    据争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟战报，今年年初到五月初的四个月内，这支爱国武装力量歼灭了二百五十多名葡萄牙殖民军，俘虏一名殖民军军官。
    在安哥拉宽多—库班哥地区的塞尔帕平托和在莫西哥地区的卢索，都是葡萄牙殖民军的重要据点。据报道，南非帮凶军在卢索为葡萄牙训练殖民军，指挥镇压安哥拉东部爱国武装力量的殖民军总部也设在卢索。争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟的游击队，向这两个据点连续不断地发动了猛烈进攻。
    在塞尔帕平托东北地区，游击队在去年十月歼灭敌军四十六名；十一月，伏击一支葡萄牙殖民军，歼灭敌军五十二名；今年年初，又歼灭敌军九名，俘虏一名殖民军军官。
    游击队于今年二月还在卢索附近击毁了敌军军用车一辆，歼灭车上敌军三十名。
    这支爱国武装力量在安哥拉的奔达、马查多将军城、塞尔帕平托和卢索等地建立了地方民兵，配合作战。
    这些地区的部队几乎完全是用缴获来的葡萄牙武器和物资装备起来的，这些战利品中很多是以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团提供的。
    日益壮大的游击队，还深入到西部和北部仍受葡萄牙殖民军控制的地区，发动群众，加强政治工作，训练军队，建立地方民兵组织。
