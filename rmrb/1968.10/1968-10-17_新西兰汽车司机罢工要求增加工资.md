Three hundred private bus drivers in Auckland, New Zealand, went on strike on the 11th to demand a wage increase. The striking workers have decided that they will go on strike every Friday until their reasonable demands are met.

The employers, with the encouragement and support of the reactionary authorities, not only refused the workers' demands but also increased pressure on the workers. They even announced that if the striking workers do not cancel their decision to strike one day each week, they will not be allowed to work on regular days either.

However, the striking workers have not yielded to the employers' pressure and continue their struggle. Their just cause is gaining support from the working people of New Zealand. All four thousand drivers from other bus companies in Auckland have decided to stop work on the 17th and hold a rally in solidarity with their striking comrades.

    新西兰汽车司机罢工要求增加工资
    新西兰奥克兰市三百名私营公共汽车司机十一日举行罢工，要求增加工资。罢工工人决定在他们的合理要求得到满足以前，每星期五都将举行罢工。
    资方在反动当局的怂恿和支持下，不仅拒绝工人的要求，反而变本加厉地对工人施加压力，竟然宣布如果罢工工人不取消每周罢工一天的决定，平常日子也不让他们工作。
    但是，罢工工人并没有屈从资方压力，一直坚持斗争。他们的正义斗争正在得到新西兰工人群众的支持。奥克兰市所有其他公共汽车公司的四千名司机决定在十七日停止工作，举行声援大会，支持正在罢工的工人兄弟。　（据新华社讯）
