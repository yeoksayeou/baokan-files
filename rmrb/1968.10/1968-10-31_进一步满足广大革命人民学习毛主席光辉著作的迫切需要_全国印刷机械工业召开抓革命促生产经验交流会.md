In the midst of the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, relevant central departments convened a national conference on the experience of promoting revolution and production in the printing machinery industry in Qingdao. Representatives from more than 160 units in over 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country attended the conference. With deep proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they severely criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the industrial and cultural systems who obstructed the publication of Chairman Mao's works and sabotaged the development of the printing machinery industry. They also shared experiences in promoting revolution and production.

The representatives attending the conference pointed out that to meet the urgent needs of the broad revolutionary people for Chairman Mao's brilliant works, it is necessary to vigorously develop the printing machinery industry and gradually mechanize and automate typesetting, printing, and binding. This is the glorious political task of the revolutionary workers in the printing machinery industry.

The conference pointed out that over the past decade, there has been a struggle between two lines in the printing machinery industry. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, in their attempt to restore capitalism in China, have relentlessly obstructed the publication of Chairman Mao's works and the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, suppressing and strangling the production and matching of printing machinery. Under the obstruction and sabotage of these reactionaries, the development of the printing machinery industry has been slow, with outdated technology and equipment, remaining in a backward state for a long time.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers in the printing machinery industry raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," seized back the leadership usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and with their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, unleashed their revolutionary enthusiasm. They produced various printing equipment in large quantities to meet the needs of publishing Chairman Mao's works, achieving a great leap in the production of printing machinery. In 1967, the national production of printing machinery was 3.5 times the average annual production before the Cultural Revolution. This year, the revolutionary and production situation in the printing machinery industry has been excellent and continues to improve. It is estimated that the total annual production of printing machinery will be six times the average annual production before the Cultural Revolution, with many new varieties added.

Representatives from units such as the Beijing People's Machinery Factory, Shandong Weihai Machinery Factory, Sichuan Yibin Printing Machinery Factory, as well as the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee, introduced their experiences in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, intensifying class struggle, mobilizing the masses, and self-reliantly developing printing machinery production. These experiences were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

The numerous situations exchanged during the conference indicated that in recent times, the working class in the printing machinery industry, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao to "seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation," has swiftly launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Broad revolutionary workers have deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of running enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, breaking through old frameworks, and blazing a new trail for the trial production of new printing machinery products.

During the conference, workers from the Beijing People's Machinery Factory presented the precious gift of mangoes (replicas) given by the great leader Chairman Mao to the capital's workers and peasants' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to the revolutionary masses in the printing machinery industry across various regions and to the revolutionary committees of Shandong Province and Qingdao and Weihai cities. The representatives, with hearts filled with boundless excitement and joy, shouted thousands of times, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" They solemnly pledged to Chairman Mao: The revolutionary workers in the printing machinery industry will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, resolutely carry out all battle orders from the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, use revolution to drive production, strive to overfulfill this year's printing machinery production plan, and produce more high-efficiency, high-quality printing machinery.

    进一步满足广大革命人民学习毛主席光辉著作的迫切需要
    全国印刷机械工业召开抓革命促生产经验交流会
    代表们表示，一定紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真搞好本单位的斗批改，以革命带动生产，为超额完成今年印刷机械生产计划，为生产更多的高效率、高质量的印刷机械而奋斗
    据新华社济南三十日电　在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，中央有关部门在青岛召开了全国印刷机械工业抓革命促生产经验交流会议。来自全国二十多个省、市、自治区一百六十多个有关单位的代表，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工业、文化系统的代理人为阻挠毛主席著作出版而极力破坏印刷机械工业发展的滔天罪行，交流了抓革命、促生产的经验。
    出席会议的代表指出，为满足广大革命人民对毛主席光辉著作的迫切需要，大力发展印刷机械工业，使制版、印刷、装订逐步实现机械化、自动化，这是印刷机械工业部门革命职工的光荣政治任务。
    会议指出，十几年来，在印刷机械工业部门一直存在着两条道路、两条路线的斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人为在中国复辟资本主义，竭力阻挠毛主席著作的出版和毛泽东思想的传播，压制和扼杀印刷机械的生产和配套。在这些反动家伙的阻挠、破坏下，印刷机械工业生产发展缓慢，技术设备陈旧，长期处于落后状态。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动中，印刷机械工业部门的广大革命职工高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，夺回了被党内一小撮走资派窃踞的领导权。革命职工们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，发挥冲天的革命干劲，大造各种印刷设备，满足毛主席著作大量出版的需要，使印刷机械的生产出现了大飞跃，一九六七年全国印刷机械的产量等于文化大革命前平均年产量的三倍半。今年以来，印刷机械工业战线上的革命、生产形势大好，越来越好，预计全年印刷机械的总产量可等于文化大革命前平均年产量的六倍，并且增加了许多新品种。
    参加会议的北京人民机器厂、山东威海机械厂、四川宜宾印刷机械厂，以及山东省和青岛市革命委员会等单位的代表，分别介绍了他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，放手发动群众，自力更生，迅速发展印刷机械生产的经验，受到出席会议同志的热情欢迎。
    会上交流的大量情况表明：最近以来，印刷机械工业战线上的工人阶级，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的教导，迅速掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。广大革命职工深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线，打破了旧框框，为印刷机械新产品的试制工作闯出了一条崭新的道路。
    会议期间，北京人民机器厂的工人把伟大领袖毛主席赠送给首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的珍贵礼物——芒果（复制品），转送给各地印刷机械工业战线上的无产阶级革命派和山东省及青岛、威海两市革命委员会。代表们怀着无比激动、无比兴奋的心情，千遍万遍地高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”他们庄严地向毛主席宣誓：印刷机械工业战线上的革命职工一定紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，认真搞好本单位的斗、批、改，以革命带动生产，为超额完成今年印刷机械生产计划，为生产更多的高效率、高质量的印刷机械而奋斗。
