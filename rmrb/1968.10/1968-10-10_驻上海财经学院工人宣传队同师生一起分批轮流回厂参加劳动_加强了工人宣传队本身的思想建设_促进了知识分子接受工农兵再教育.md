The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Shanghai Finance and Economics University organizes its members and the school's teachers and students to return to the factory in shifts to participate in production labor. This has significantly strengthened the ideological construction of the workers' propaganda team and promoted the re-education of intellectuals by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 9th: The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Shanghai Finance and Economics University organizes its members and the school's teachers and students to return to the factory in shifts to participate in production labor. This has significantly strengthened the ideological construction of the workers' propaganda team and promoted the re-education of intellectuals by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The members of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at this university are all workers from the Shanghai Bicycle Factory. After entering Shanghai Finance and Economics University, they established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with revolutionary teachers and students, quickly transforming the school's appearance. To strengthen the ideological construction of the workers' propaganda team, lead the educational revolution of the school, and guide revolutionary teachers and students to receive re-education by workers, peasants, and soldiers, the workers' propaganda team, based on the suggestions of some veteran workers, implemented a system where teams take turns to return to the factory to participate in production labor. Each team of workers' propaganda team members and the teachers and students they lead (about 200 people) take a certain amount of time each month to return to the factory to participate in labor. The effect of this trial run by five teams has been very good.

The comrades from the workers' propaganda team felt deeply after returning to the factory to participate in labor. They all said that entering the university, all they saw were tall buildings and deep courtyards, with no sound of machinery, and without participating in labor, they would gradually change if they continued like this. Returning to the factory to participate in labor every month strengthens their ability to resist and prevent revisionism. The workers' propaganda team members returning to the factory for labor exchanged situations with those left in the factory, mutually promoting each other. The comrades left in the factory encouraged their comrades who had entered the university to further understand the great significance of the proletarian leadership in the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to always lead the school. The comrades from the workers' propaganda team saw that the comrades left in the factory were seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own factory, shouldering the heavy responsibility of "grasp revolution, promote production," and received great education, strengthening their confidence in leading the educational revolution of the school, and determined to achieve new successes in leading the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The revolutionary teachers and students of the school, following the workers' propaganda team teachers to the factory for labor, is a good opportunity for intellectuals to receive re-education by workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their experiences can be summarized into three main points:

First, they have an even deeper hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Some students, due to a lack of sensory understanding of the harm caused by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, did not hate it deeply enough and did not criticize it thoroughly. After participating in labor in the factory, they discovered that they indeed had the airs of intellectuals and had a significant gap in thoughts and feelings with the worker comrades. This made them even more hostile to the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by China's Khrushchev, determined to criticize it thoroughly. At the same time, they increasingly understood the great significance of the proletarian educational revolution, the urgency of the transformation of intellectuals, and were determined to accept re-education by workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly changing their old thoughts, and becoming intellectuals welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Second, they more consciously support the proletarian leadership in the educational revolution of the school. Some students originally supported the workers' propaganda team leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school verbally, but had doubts in their hearts. After participating in labor in the factory and participating in the struggle, criticism, and transformation activities in the factory, they received profound education. They saw the boundless enthusiasm of the worker comrades in revolution and production, saw the worker comrades managing the factory with Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly smashing the achievements of the revisionist line of running enterprises, and saw the thorough revolutionary spirit and boundless wisdom of the worker comrades, further understanding Chairman Mao's great teachings: the proletariat must lead everything. Many students said: The worker comrades resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, with the great ambition of "liberating all mankind," coming to our school to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation, this fills us with the confidence of victory.

Third, they further received education on the high organizational discipline of the proletariat. The workers' propaganda team entering the school gave a fierce blow to the anarchist trend among teachers and students, stopping the lazy and free-spirited bad habits of some intellectuals. But some students could not accept it at first. After participating in labor in the factory, comparing themselves with the worker comrades, they naturally found the ideological root of this gap, which is their lack of high revolutionary spirit and strict organizational discipline of the proletariat.

Because the comrades from the workers' propaganda team and the revolutionary teachers and students return to the factory for labor regularly, their relationship has become closer, and heart-to-heart talks have been widely carried out, strengthening the political and ideological work of the workers' propaganda team on the teachers and students, creating extremely favorable conditions for fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of revolutionary teachers and students, and leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school.

    驻上海财经学院工人宣传队同师生一起分批轮流回厂参加劳动
    加强了工人宣传队本身的思想建设  促进了知识分子接受工农兵再教育
    据新华社上海九日电　驻上海财经学院工人毛泽东思想宣传队，分期分批组织队员连同学校师生，轮流回工厂参加生产劳动，对加强工人宣传队思想建设，促进知识分子接受工农兵的再教育，都起了很好作用。
    驻这个学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员，都是上海自行车厂的工人。他们进驻上海财经学院后大办毛泽东思想学习班，同革命师生一起学习、落实毛主席的最新指示，使学校迅速出现了新面貌。为了加强工人宣传队本身的思想建设，领导好学校的教育革命，同时引导革命师生接受工农兵的再教育，工人宣传队根据一些老工人的建议，试行以连队为单位，分批轮流回厂参加生产劳动的制度。每个连的工人宣传队员及其领导的全系师生（二百人左右），每月抽出一定时间回厂参加劳动。从五个连试行的情况看，效果很好。
    工人宣传队的同志回厂参加劳动后，感触很深。他们都说，进了大学，满眼都是高楼深院，听不到机器声，不参加劳动，长期这样下去，自己也会变。每个月轮流回厂参加劳动，就增强了反修、防修的力量。工人宣传队员回厂劳动，同留厂的工人交流情况，相互促进。留厂的工人同志鼓励进驻大学的战友进一步认识工人阶级领导学校斗、批、改的伟大意义，永远领导学校。工人宣传队的同志看到留厂同志认真搞好本厂的斗、批、改，挑起厂内“抓革命，促生产”的重担，受到很大教育，增强了搞好学校教育革命的信心，决心在领导学校斗、批、改中立新功。
    学校革命师生跟随工人宣传队老师傅下厂劳动，是知识分子接受工农兵再教育的很好机会。他们的体会，归结起来主要有三条：
    一，更加痛恨反革命修正主义教育路线。有的学生过去由于对反革命修正主义教育路线的危害缺乏感性认识，恨得不深，批得不透。到工厂参加劳动后，发现自己确实有知识分子架子，在思想感情上同工人同志有很大的差距，从而对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线更加仇恨，决心把它批臭批透。同时，他们越来越认识到无产阶级教育革命的伟大意义，认识到知识分子改造的迫切性，决心接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，做工农兵所欢迎的知识分子。
    二，更自觉地拥护工人阶级领导学校的教育革命。有些学生本来对工人宣传队领导学校斗、批、改，口头上拥护，内心里怀疑。到工厂劳动，并参加工厂里的斗、批、改活动后，受到深刻教育。他们看到工人同志在革命和生产中的冲天干劲，看到工人同志用毛泽东思想管理工厂，彻底摧毁修正主义办企业路线的巨大胜利成果，看到了工人同志的彻底革命精神和无穷智慧，进一步理解了毛主席的伟大教导：工人阶级必须领导一切。许多学生说：工人同志坚决听毛主席的话，怀着“解放全人类”的伟大气魄，来到我们学校领导斗、批、改，这使我们充满了胜利的信心。
    三，进一步受到了工人阶级高度的组织纪律性的教育。工人宣传队跨进学校，对师生中的无政府主义思潮进行了猛烈的冲击，煞住了某些知识分子懒懒散散、自由主义的坏习气。但有些学生一时接受不了。他们到工厂参加劳动后，对照工人同志的表现来检查自己，就很自然地找到了这个差距的思想根子，是自己缺乏无产阶级高度的革命性和严格的组织纪律性。
    由于工人宣传队同志与革命师生一起定期回厂劳动，密切了他们之间的关系，谈心活动广泛开展，加强了工人宣传队对师生的政治思想工作，为充分调动革命师生员工的积极因素，为领导好学校的斗、批、改，创造了极其有利的条件。
