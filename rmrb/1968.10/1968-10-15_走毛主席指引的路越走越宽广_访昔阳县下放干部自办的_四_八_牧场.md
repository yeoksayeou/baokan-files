The Path Guided by Chairman Mao Becomes Wider and Wider
— Visiting the "April 8" Pasture Established by Cadres Sent Down from Xiyang County

The day after the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on "a large number of cadres should go down to the countryside to labor, which is an excellent opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the old, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down in batches to labor" was issued, we visited the "April 8" pasture established by cadres sent down by the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee in Shanxi Province.

The twenty-eight cadres laboring at this pasture responded to Chairman Mao's great call of the "May 7th Directive" and came here in May this year. In five months, they relied on their own hands and shoulders to build fifty-three new rooms on a barren wasteland with "no roof above and no fields below." They cleared over thirty acres of fertile land on a barren hillside covered with shrubs. On the lush pasture, they herded nearly a hundred cows, horses, and over two hundred and ten sheep. Now, during the autumn harvest, they joyfully reap the potatoes, buckwheat, oats, and vegetables they have cultivated with their own sweat.

Several months ago, the "fair-skinned and soft-handed" office cadres now have calloused hands and a scent of earth on their bodies. They ride their whips up the mountains during the day and attend Mao Zedong Thought study classes at night. Their faces are tanned, and their hearts are reddened. They often proudly declare, "I am a cowherd!" "I am a shepherd!"

When Chairman Mao's latest directive on cadres going down to labor reached here, everyone was overjoyed. They excitedly said, "We have taken the right path! Following the path guided by Chairman Mao is the most glorious and happiest! We are on the path of realizing the revolutionization of cadres' thoughts, the path of combining with the workers and peasants, and the path of preventing revisionism. This path we will definitely follow, forever, all the way to communism!"

However, their journey was not smooth sailing.

On May 12th this year, the first batch of cadres sent down to labor from Xiyang County arrived at the "April 8" pasture. The next day, Manager Zhao Furong led everyone to traverse the ten-mile deep valley of the pasture. Standing on the high mountain top, looking at the vast pasture, with abundant water and lush grass, it was indeed a good place for labor training, ideological reform, and developing animal husbandry! However, turning back, there was not even a trace of a pasture. The cadres sent down lived in borrowed rooms eight miles away from the pasture in the Shisi Dui Production Brigade and borrowed fire to cook. At this time, facing such difficult conditions, some people wavered, and the idea that "cadres going down is a demotion" and "it's embarrassing" resurfaced.

Is it "embarrassing" or glorious for cadres to go down to labor? A great discussion unfolded at the "April 8" pasture. They reviewed Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Articles" again. They learned from the proletarian revolutionary spirit of the heroes of Dazhai, and the discussion became more heated.

Some said: In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist cadre line of Liu Shaoqi, and some cadres were poisoned by the exploitative class ideology of becoming officials and lords, detached from labor and the masses. Now, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat has taken power, guiding cadres to follow Chairman Mao's path of being both an "official" and a "commoner." On April 8th, the anniversary of the establishment of the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, it was decided to establish the "April 8" pasture, entrusting us with the heavy responsibility of implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive, and pioneering the path of going down to labor and preventing revisionism. Is this not glorious but "embarrassing"?

Some said: When we set out, the responsible comrades of the county revolutionary committee pinned Chairman Mao's badges on us, gave us the shining four volumes of revolutionary treasures, and the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They repeatedly instructed us to do a good job in the revolutionization of thoughts, thoroughly reform our worldview, and set an example for cadres going down to labor. Is this not glorious but "embarrassing"?

Some said: When we came to the pasture, the people of the revolutionary base area warmly welcomed us along the way, and the poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically received us, encouraging us to adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Is this not glorious but "embarrassing"?

Cadres going down to labor is the most glorious! Those who think it is "embarrassing" are influenced by the bourgeois "self" in their minds, still have the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in their heads, and are affected by old habits. Looking at cadres going down to labor from the standpoint of the proletariat, it is the most glorious; looking at it from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie, it is "embarrassing." Being "afraid of losing face" is actually afraid of losing one's bourgeois face.

The discussion ended, and everyone wrote a resolution, determined to thoroughly reform their worldview through labor here and vow to make the "April 8" pasture a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The first labor class at the "April 8" pasture was to go up the mountain to clear the land.

On the first day of class, the cadres sent down got up at 4:30 AM, walked over ten miles, climbed the high barren mountain, and came to the classroom. The classroom was a three-acre old barren hillside covered with black thorns as tall as a person and as thick as a teacup. The tools were a pickaxe. Facing such a clearing task, some people were worried about how to start. At this time, Manager Zhao Furong stood on a large rock and shouted, "Comrades, today we are not just clearing black thorns but also uprooting the bourgeois 'self' from our minds, uprooting the black roots of Liu Shaoqi's revisionism. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, 'make up our minds, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory'!" Saying this, he jumped into the black thorns to clear the land. Then, Deputy Manager Fu Junwei jumped in, and everyone followed, one after another.

A few days later, their hands were covered with blisters, and their waists and arms ached. But they thought of picking up the pickaxe, throwing away their official airs, and walking the path of preventing revisionism, and they were full of energy. Every day before dawn, they would hold up Chairman Mao's portrait and the sign with Chairman Mao's quotations, carry the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shoulder a pickaxe, and carry their meals to the fields. They worked ten hours a day and had to travel eighteen miles of mountain roads back and forth. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings, told stories of revolutionary cadres clearing the land during the Anti-Japanese War, and constantly inspired themselves with the proletarian hard-bone spirit of the people of Dazhai. Everyone's enthusiasm grew stronger.

A month passed. The vast black thorns disappeared, and thirty acres of fertile land appeared before them. The "new farmers" sowed seeds on this land with their own hands. Soon, green seedlings sprouted from the ground, their roots grew deeper, and their branches and leaves grew lusher. After several months of training, everyone's bodies became strong.

However, everyone deeply felt that "laboring is hard, but changing thoughts is even harder." Some cadres were used to the "wind and rain-free" life in office buildings. When they first came to the pasture, they had ideological struggles between glory and "embarrassment," doing or not doing. After some time, they began to struggle with whether to persist or give up halfway, whether to settle down or work for a while and go down the mountain.

Once, someone in the canteen, considering the long-term plan for everyone's life, asked, "Are you still treating this as a temporary job?"

Once, the production brigade near the pasture cared about the life of the cadres sent down and exchanged their buckwheat and oats with them. A farmer asked the deputy secretary of the party branch of the pasture, Song Runfu, "Where are your worker comrades?" Song Runfu smiled and replied, "Our workers are herding sheep and horses on the mountain!" But after some comrades in the pasture heard this, someone got angry: "We are cadres, why did you, the leader, acknowledge us as workers and not explain to the masses."

These incidents showed that some cadres still had the idea of being able to go up but not down, able to be officials but not commoners, and had not made up their minds to work in the pasture for life. Facing these active thoughts, the party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings and conduct self-criticism and criticize revisionism. In the discussion of Song Runfu's response to the farmer, after a debate, everyone realized that Song Runfu was right, and the mistake was in some comrades' bourgeois thoughts still playing tricks. Why is it comfortable to be called a "cadre" and dissatisfied to be called a "worker"? This is because the official airs have not been thrown away. Some comrades said, "The farmer calling us workers is the greatest honor, not looking down on us but looking up to us. The working class is the leading class. In fact, we are not yet qualified workers. Learning from the working class and becoming a true qualified 'worker' is the greatest glory! The greatest happiness!"

A twenty-seven-year-old young cadre, who had been in school for twelve years straight from home to school, and after graduating from high school, entered the office and worked in the county Chinese herbal medicine company. This time, he came to the pasture with a try-it-out attitude. During the first class of clearing the land and uprooting black thorns in the pasture, his hands were covered with twelve blisters. He thought, "If I persist for a few more days and go down the mountain back to the office, it will be more comfortable than laboring." Just as he was wavering in his thoughts, the responsible comrades of the pasture sat with him on the large rock at the top of the mountain, studied Chairman Mao's teachings together, helped him criticize his selfishness, and made him realize that his bourgeois worldview must be reformed! He said, "From my soft hands, I further understood the evil of the bourgeois education system. My hands are blistered, and I should hate the bourgeois education system." Thus, he went where there were difficulties, using his actual actions to criticize the bourgeoisie. He picked up the shepherd's whip and went up the mountain to herd sheep, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, determined to follow Chairman Mao's path for life, to the end, without turning back! The shepherds of the nearby production team saw his determination and often enthusiastically talked to him, giving him one lesson after another. At this time, he deeply and concretely realized that the true heroes are the masses, and he was naive and laughable; the masses are teachers, and he should honestly be a student. He said, "In the past, I thought 'studying' and 'being a cadre' were superior things and thought being a shepherd or cowherd was 'ugly'; now, I truly understand that not being able to labor is ugly."

There was also a cadre from the Xiyang County New Hua Bookstore. At first, when he was asked to herd cows, he was afraid of hardship. He thought that he was very poor in the past, and at the age of nine, he herded cows for the landlord for several years. Chairman Mao saved him from the sea of bitterness, making him stand up and become a cadre. Now, asking him to herd cows again, he refused. After reminiscing about the bitterness and sweetness, learning from the people of Dazhai, he said, "In the past, herding cows for the landlord was class bitterness; now, herding cows with a whip is preventing revisionism, so as not to suffer again! I must pick up the cowherding whip and never forget the class bitterness." Someone told him, "Herding cows is a skilled job. Once you learn it, you won't be able to leave, and it will be difficult to go down the mountain in the future." He said, "Go down the mountain? I want to settle down on the mountain and hold the cowherding whip for life."

At the "April 8" pasture, many cadres are striding forward on the path of thought revolutionization. A young cadre who used to be afraid of horses kicking and cows smelling now loves the pasture. He walked into the cow pen full of cow dung to shovel it, with cow dung on his hands and legs, but he was no longer afraid of the smell because his feelings had changed. He said, "I am twenty-three years old and want to work until I am thirty-three, fifty-three, seventy-three, eighty-three. Such a good school, I want to stay for life!"

The change in thoughts and feelings brought about a great change in style.

In the past, some cadres, when they went down to the countryside, saw that the brigade's cows and horses were sick and did not care; now, they treat the pasture as their home, and everyone loves and takes care of the cows and horses. One night, a horse fell ill, and a cadre volunteered to drive the horse to the veterinary station twelve miles away from the pasture. On the way, it was cold, and he was afraid the horse would catch a cold and the illness would worsen, so he took off the cotton coat he was wearing and put it on the horse's back.

In the past, some cadres did not hesitate to spend the state's money in the office; now, they realize that the state's money and property are earned by the laboring people with their sweat, and they should cherish the state's money and property, strive hard, and be self-reliant. They established the pasture themselves, using stones instead of buying bricks when building houses; stones were opened by their own hands; herding cows and horses without hiring herdsmen, learning to do it themselves; repairing broken horse halters without spending money, doing it themselves; not hiring cooks for the canteen, learning to do it themselves; even the large pins used in the office, they replaced them with thorns picked from the hillside, saving the state's expenses.

In the past, some cadres were distant from the masses; now, they are close. The comrades in the pasture carried on the style of the old Eighth Route Army, often helping the villagers carry water, sweep the yard, and chop firewood. During the busy farming season, they helped the Shisi Dui Production Brigade pull wheat for ten days and established a close relationship with the local poor and lower-middle peasants. The masses reflected, "'The path of the 'April 8' pasture is becoming wider and wider, and the cadres are becoming better and better!'"

### 走毛主席指引的路越走越宽广——访昔阳县下放干部自办的“四·八”牧场

    走毛主席指引的路越走越宽广
    ——访昔阳县下放干部自办的“四·八”牧场
    在伟大领袖毛主席“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动”的最新指示发表的第二天，我们访问了山西省昔阳县革命委员会组织下放干部创办的“四·八”牧场。
    在这个牧场劳动的二十八名下放干部，是响应毛主席“五·七”指示的伟大号召，在今年五月来到这里的。五个月中，他们靠双手，凭双肩，在“上无片瓦，下无垄地”的荒滩上，盖起了五十三间新房；在灌木丛生的荒坡上，开出了三十多亩肥沃的土地；在野草丰茂的牧场上，挥鞭牧放着近百头牛、马和二百一十多只羊。眼下，正值秋收，他们满怀喜悦的心情，收获着用自己汗水浇灌的土豆、莜麦、荞麦等杂粮和蔬菜。
    几个月前“脸白、手嫩”的机关干部，现在手上磨起厚茧子，身上散发着泥土香。他们白天挥鞭上山，黑夜参加毛泽东思想学习班，脸晒黑了，心炼红了。他们常常自豪地大声说：“我是牛倌！”“我是羊倌！”
    当毛主席关于干部下放劳动的最新指示传到这里的时候，人人喜得心里开了花。他们激动地说：“我们的路子走对了！我们走毛主席指引的路最光荣，最幸福！我们走的是实现干部思想革命化的路，是同工农群众相结合的路，是反修防修的路。这条路我们走定了，要永远走下去，一直走到共产主义！”
    但是，他们在前进的过程中并不是一帆风顺的。
    今年五月十二日，昔阳县第一批下放劳动的干部来到了“四·八”牧场。第二天，场长赵福荣带领大家走遍了牧场的十里深沟。登上高高的山顶，远望广阔的牧坡，水足草旺，真是个进行劳动锻炼、改造思想、发展畜牧业的好地方！但是，回头一看，牧场连个影子也没有。下放干部在离牧场所在地八里远的寺上大队借房居住，借火做饭。这时，面对着这样的困难条件，有些人动摇了，认为干部下放是“下降”，“面子上难看”的思想，又冒出来了。
    干部下放劳动，究竟是“难看”，还是光荣呢？一场大讨论在“四·八”牧场展开了。他们重温了毛主席的“五·七”指示，又一次学习了毛主席的光辉著作
  “老三篇”，学习英雄的大寨人的无产阶级革命精神，越讨论越热烈。
    有的说：过去，党内一小撮走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义干部路线，有的干部中了做官当老爷的剥削阶级思想的毒，脱离劳动，脱离群众。现在，无产阶级革命派掌了权，引导干部走毛主席指引的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的路。昔阳县革委会在今年四月八日成立一周年的时候，决定成立“四·八”牧场，把落实毛主席最新指示的重担交给我们挑，把下放劳动，反修防修的路子交给我们闯，这难道不是光荣，而是“难看”吗？
    有的说：我们出发的时候，县革委会的负责同志给我们戴上毛主席像章，送给我们金光闪闪的四卷革命宝书，送给我们红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，千嘱咐万叮咛，要我们搞好思想革命化，彻底改造世界观，为干部下放劳动作出榜样，这难道不是光荣，而是“难看”吗？
    有的说：我们到牧场来，革命老根据地的群众沿途热烈欢迎，贫下中农热情接待，鼓励我们坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这难道不是光荣，而是“难看”吗？
    干部下放劳动就是最光荣！认为“难看”的人，是资产阶级的“私”字在头脑中作怪，是头脑里还有中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒，是受旧的习惯势力的影响。站在无产阶级立场上看干部下放劳动，就觉得最光荣；站在资产阶级立场上看干部下放劳动，就觉得“难看”。“怕丢人”，实际上是怕丢了自己的资产阶级面子。
    讨论结束了，大家写出了一份份决心书，决心在这里通过劳动，彻底改造自己的世界观，誓把“四·八”牧场办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    “四·八”牧场的第一堂劳动课，是上山开荒。
    开课第一天，下放干部们四点半起床，走十多里路，登上高高的荒山，来到课堂。课堂是一块三亩多地的老荒坡，长满了一人多高的茶杯口粗的黑圪针，工具是一把镢头。面对这样的开荒任务，有人发愁没法下手。这时，场长赵福荣站在一块大石头上高声说：“同志们，我们今天开荒，不仅仅是刨黑圪针，而是刨我们头脑里只能当官、不能当老百姓的资产阶级‘私’字的根，刨中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义流毒的黑根。我们要遵照毛主席的教导，‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利’！”说罢，他跳进了黑圪针里去开荒。接着，副场长傅俊维跳进去了，大家一个跟着一个跳进去了。
    几天以后，他们满手磨起了血泡，腰酸胳膊痛。但是，他们一想到拿起镢把子，打掉了官架子，走的是反修防修的路，就浑身是劲。每天天不明，他们就高举着毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，怀揣红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，扛着一把把大镢头，担着饭下地。他们一天劳动十个小时，还要往返走十八里山路。他们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的伟大教导，讲抗日战争时期革命干部上山开荒的故事，用大寨人改天换地的无产阶级硬骨头精神不断激励自己，大家的干劲越来越足。
    一个月过去了。大片的黑圪针看不见了，三十亩肥沃的土地展现在面前。“新农民”们亲手在这块土地上撒下了种子。不久，地面长出了绿油油的青苗，根子越扎越深，枝叶越长越茂。同志们经过几个月的锻炼，身体练得硬棒了。
    但是，同志们都深刻地体会到：“劳动过硬不容易，思想过硬更难。”有些干部在机关大楼里过惯了“风不吹，雨不淋”的生活，刚来牧场，思想上存在着光荣与“难看”，干与不干的斗争。过了一段时间，又开始了坚持下去还是半路收摊，安家落户还是干一段下山的思想斗争。
    有一次，食堂里的同志从长远打算为大家安排生活，有的人听了就问：“你还把这摊摊当个光景过哩！”
    有一次，牧场附近的生产大队关心下放干部的生活，把自己的莜麦、荞麦换给他们吃。一位农民问牧场的党支部副书记宋润福：“你们的工人同志去哪里啦？”宋润福笑着回答：“俺们的工人上山放羊赶马啦！”可是，这件事被牧场的一些同志听到后，有人反倒生了气：“我们是干部，你这个领导为什么承认我们是工人，不向群众解释。”
    这些情况说明：有些干部的头脑中还存在着能上不能下、能官不能民的思想，还没有下定决心在牧场干一辈子。针对这些活思想，党支部组织大家学习了毛主席的教导，进行斗私批修。在讨论宋润福对那位农民的回答时，经过一场辩论，大家认识到：宋润福同志没有错，错在一些同志的资产阶级思想还在作怪。为什么叫“干部”就舒服，喊“工人”就不满？这是官架子还没有打掉。有的同志说：“农民喊我们工人，这是给我们的最大荣誉，不是把我们看得很低，而是把我们看得很高。工人阶级是领导阶级。实际上我们还够不上一个合格的工人。向工人阶级学习，做一个真正的合格‘工人’，那才是最大的光荣！最大的幸福！”
    有一位二十七岁的青年干部，从家门进校门，整整读书十二年；高中毕业后，进了机关门，在县药材公司工作。这次下放劳动，他抱着试试看的态度来到牧场。牧场里上开荒刨黑圪针的第一课时，他双手磨起了十二个血泡。他想：再坚持几天，下山回机关，总比劳动舒服。正在他思想动摇的时候，牧场负责同志和他一块坐在山顶的大石头上谈心，一块学习毛主席的教导，帮助他斗私，使他认识到自己的资产阶级世界观不改造不得了！他说：“从我这双娇嫩的手上，我进一步认识了资产阶级教育制度的罪恶，我手上打了血泡，应该痛恨资产阶级的教育制度。”于是，他那里困难就到那里去，用自己的实际行动批判资产阶级。他拿起放羊鞭子上山牧羊，不怕苦不怕累，决心一辈子走毛主席指引的路，走到底，不回头！附近生产队的羊工们看他决心大，经常热情地和他谈话，给他上了一堂又一堂的教育课。这时，他才深切而又具体地认识到真正的英雄是群众，自己是幼稚可笑的；群众是先生，自己要老老实实当小学生。他说：“以前，我觉得‘读书’、‘当干部’是上等事，认为当羊工、牛工‘丑’；现在，我才真正认识到不会劳动是丑事。”
    还有昔阳县新华书店的一个干部，起初让他去放牛，他怕苦。他认为自己过去家里很穷，九岁就给地主放牛，一直放了好几年，毛主席把他从苦海中救了出来，使他翻了身，当了干部，现在再让他去放牛，他不干。经过忆苦思甜教育，学习大寨人，他说：“过去给地主放牛，受的是阶级苦；现在提鞭放牛是反修防修，是为了不再受苦！一定要拿起放牛鞭，不忘阶级苦。”有人对他说：“放牛是技术活，学会就离不开，将来下山就不好办。”他说：“下什么山，我要在山上安家落户，拿一辈子放牛鞭。”
    在“四·八”牧场，许多干部都正在思想革命化的大道上阔步前进。一位过去见马怕踢、见牛怕臭的青年干部，现在爱上了牧场。他走进遍地是稀牛粪的牛圈里刨粪，手上、腿上沾满了牛屎，但他不再怕臭了，因为感情起了变化。他说：“我今年二十三，要干到三十三、五十三、七十三、八十三。这样的好学校，我要住一辈子！”
    思想感情的变化，带来了作风的大转变。
    以前，有的干部下乡，看见队里的牛马生病，不当一回事；现在，他们以牧场为家，人人爱护牛马。有一天深夜，一匹马病了，一个干部自告奋勇，把马赶到离牧场十二里的兽医站去治。路上，天冷，他怕马冻着，病加重，把自己身上披着的棉衣一甩，披到了马背上。
    以前，有的干部在机关花国家的钱不心疼，现在他们体会到国家的钱财是劳动人民用汗水换来的，要珍惜国家钱财，艰苦奋斗，自力更生。他们自办牧场，盖房能用石头的就不买砖，石头靠自己动手开；放牛放马不请牧工，自己挥鞭学着干；马笼头坏了，不花钱修，自己动手补；食堂不花钱请炊事员，自己动手学着干；甚至办公用的大头针，他们用山坡上采回来的刺圪针代替，给国家节约开支。
    以前，有的干部和群众的距离远，现在贴得紧了。牧场的同志发扬老八路作风，经常给老乡们担水、扫院、打柴。农忙时，他们帮助寺上大队拔了十天谷，和当地贫下中农建立了亲密的关系。群众反映说：“‘四·八’牧场的路子越走越宽，干部变得越来越好！”
