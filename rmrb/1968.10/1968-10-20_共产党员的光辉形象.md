Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." Comrade Jiang Qing, who personally cultivated the revolutionary model opera *The Red Detachment of Women*, successfully created the glorious image of a Communist Party member, Ah Qing.

Ah Qing is steadfast in her stance, has a red heart and bright eyes, and possesses a high level of class struggle awareness and rich experience in class struggle. In her struggle against the class enemy, she closely connects with the masses and actively arouses the class consciousness of the people. Under her leadership, the people of Sha Jianping are tightly united around the Party and actively cooperate with the New Fourth Army in launching fierce attacks against the enemy.

In face-to-face, close-quarters combat with the enemy, Ah Qing demonstrates astonishing wisdom and bravery. Jiao Deyi, a treacherous and cunning Hanjian, devises one plot after another and employs one poisonous scheme after another in an attempt to annihilate the wounded and sick soldiers of the New Fourth Army left behind in Sha Jianping. In the urgent situation where Jiao Deyi forces the common people to fish and catch crabs in Lake Yangcheng to lure the New Fourth Army out of the reed marshes, Ah Qing, in a moment of crisis, cleverly throws a teapot into the reed marshes, "baiting them to come and shoot," reporting the enemy's movements to the New Fourth Army and foiling the enemy's schemes. In the situation where Jiao Deyi has posted sentries and seized boats, strictly sealing off the area, she seizes the enemy's weaknesses and cleverly shakes off the enemy, establishing contact with higher Party authorities and laying a trap to annihilate the enemy. When the class enemy interrogates Grandma Sha in front of her, she remains calm and composed, resolute and decisive, saving Grandma Sha and uncovering the enemy's command post. The enemy still believes she is "one of their own."

Where does Ah Qing's great wisdom and courage come from? It comes from her great loyalty. She has a heart that is loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and loyal to Chairman Mao. "Party, you give me wisdom, you give me courage, you help me overcome the enemy and pass through difficulties." Ah Qing's lyrics are her own answer to this question.

    共产党员的光辉形象
    解放军某部　丁正和
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”敬爱的江青同志亲自培育的革命样板戏《沙家浜》，成功地塑造了阿庆嫂这个共产党员的光辉形象。
    阿庆嫂立场坚定，心红眼亮，有着高度的阶级斗争觉悟和丰富的阶级斗争经验。在同阶级敌人斗争中，她紧密地联系群众，积极地启发群众的阶级觉悟。沙家浜的人民群众在她的带领下紧紧地团结在党的周围，积极配合新四军向敌人猛烈进攻。
    阿庆嫂在同敌人面对面的、短兵相接的激烈斗争中，表现了惊人的智慧和勇敢。刁德一这个“毒如蛇蝎狠如狼”的铁杆汉奸，一到沙家浜就耍了一个又一个的阴谋，使出了一条又一条的毒计，妄图消灭新四军留下来的伤病员。在刁德一强迫老百姓下阳澄湖捕鱼捉蟹，妄图诱骗新四军出芦苇荡的紧急情况下，阿庆嫂急中生智向芦苇荡投一只茶壶，“引诱他们来打枪”，向新四军报告了敌情，粉碎了敌人的诡计；在“刁德一派了岗哨又扣船”严密封锁的情况下，她利用敌人的矛盾，抓住敌人的弱点，机智地甩开了敌人，同上级党取得了联系，布下了歼灭敌人的天罗地网；阶级敌人当着她的面拷问沙奶奶，但她临危不惧，镇定自若，沉着果敢，既救了沙奶奶，又查清了敌人司令部的情况，敌人还深信她是“自己人”。
    阿庆嫂的大智大勇从何来？来源于她的大忠。她一颗红心忠于党、忠于人民、忠于毛主席。“党啊，你给我智慧，你给我勇敢，你帮助我战胜顽敌度难关。”阿庆嫂的这句唱词，就是她自己对这个问题的回答。
