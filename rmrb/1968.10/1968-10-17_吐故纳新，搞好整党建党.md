At a time when the great struggle to criticize and repudiate and carry out reform is vigorously unfolding across the nation, the important editorial "Absorbing Fresh Blood of the Proletariat" from the *Red Flag* magazine has conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on strengthening the Party. Chairman Mao has scientifically and vividly summarized the rich experience of building a proletarian party under the dictatorship of the proletariat, pointing out the correct direction for our Party's strengthening and building, and providing a great program for strengthening the Party and carrying out the struggle to criticize and repudiate and carry out reform. We, the working class, warmly acclaim, resolutely support, and will carry out every word of it.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against the class enemy." This is the correct party-building line taught by Chairman Mao. However, for a long time, China's Khrushchev, in order to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism, has frantically promoted a revisionist party-building line, vigorously spreading the fallacy of the "party of the whole people," and in organizational terms, surrendering and capitulating, pulling a large number of traitors, spies, unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and rightists into the Party, and peddling the infamous "black *Self-Cultivation*," attempting to corrupt our Party members and change the color of the state; attempting to make our Party degenerate into a revisionist party, a fascist party, and become a "tame" tool for him to restore capitalism.

The capitalist roaders in our factory and China's Khrushchev are like two peas in a pod. They faithfully peddle their master's black goods in the factory, shouting slogans like "too many industrial workers have been developed," "we should open up to intellectuals, and should focus on developing intellectuals!" They even publicly proposed to recruit "young, educated, eloquent" people into the Party. A large number of our excellent workers were kept out, yet they still shouted "too many," and even wanted to "focus on developing intellectuals," and even pulled a batch of traitors, spies, and people with unclear political backgrounds into the Party. What kind of Party members they wanted to develop is now crystal clear!

With the crowing of the rooster, the world is bright. After the birth of our factory's revolutionary committee in the stormy Cultural Revolution, with the strong assistance of the PLA stationed in the factory, we closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully mobilized the masses, launched a large-scale rectification movement, organized a rectification core group, and invited a large number of worker masses and revolutionary rebels to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through the revolutionary criticism and repudiation, we thoroughly criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line and the infamous "black *Self-Cultivation*," and studied and applied the "Old Three Articles," raising the awareness of the two-line struggle among the broad Party members, opening their eyes, and eliminating a small handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, making the Party organization's appearance completely renewed and presenting a lively and vigorous situation.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions vividly and profoundly expounded the profound significance of strengthening the Party. Chairman Mao said: "A proletarian party also needs to spit out the old and take in the new to remain vigorous. Without eliminating the dross and absorbing new blood, the Party will lose its vigor." This is our direction and path forward, and it is also a arduous task facing us at present. The large number of shocking class struggle facts exposed during the Cultural Revolution tell us that whether we can do a good job in strengthening the Party is a top priority that relates to whether the dictatorship of the proletariat can be consolidated and whether the whole country will change color. It is a top priority that decides the future of the whole of China and the destiny of the world. We are determined to rely closely on the working class, give full play to the leading role of the working class, and extensively unite the vast majority of the masses. We will seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and build our factory's Party organization into a vigorous, closely linked with the masses, and fiercely attacking the class enemy vanguard organization of the proletariat!

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on strengthening the Party were issued, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the Beijing Jianhua Chemical Factory actively organized the masses to study and discuss, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist party-building line.

    吐故纳新，搞好整党建党
    北京光学仪器厂革命委员会
    正当全国斗、批、改的伟大运动蓬勃开展的时候，《红旗》杂志的重要社论《吸收无产阶级的新鲜血液》又传达了伟大领袖毛主席关于整党建党的最新指示。毛主席最科学、最生动地总结了在无产阶级专政下建设无产阶级政党的丰富经验，为我们整党建党指明了正确的航向，是整党建党和搞好斗、批、改的伟大纲领。我们工人阶级热烈欢呼、坚决拥护、字字照办。
    毛主席指出：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”这是毛主席教导我们的正确的建党方针，是一条无产阶级建党路线。可是长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫为了颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，疯狂地推行一条修正主义建党路线，竭力散布“全民党”的谬论，在组织上招降纳叛，把大批叛徒、特务、没有改造好的地富反坏右分子拉进了党内，并大肆贩卖臭名远扬的黑《修养》，妄图使我们党员变质，使国家变色；妄图使我们的党堕落为修正主义的党，法西斯的党，成为他复辟资本主义的得心应手的“驯服”工具。
    我们厂的走资派和中国赫鲁晓夫是一根藤上的黑瓜，他们在厂内忠实地贩卖其主子的黑货，叫嚣什么“产业工人发展的太多了”，“要向知识分子开口，应当重点发展知识分子”！还公然提出要吸收“年青的，有文化的，能说会道的”这种人入党。我们大批的优秀工人被他们拒之门外，却还叫喊“太多了”，竟要“重点发展知识分子”，甚至把一批叛徒、特务和政治面目不清的人拉进党内。他们究竟要发展什么样的党员不是清清楚楚了吗？
    一唱雄鸡天下白。我们厂革命委员会在文化大革命的急风暴雨中光荣诞生以后，在驻厂解放军大力帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，充分发动群众，开展了大规模的整党运动，组织了整党核心小组，邀请了大量的工人群众和革命造反派一起举办了毛泽东思想学习班。通过革命大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线和黑《修养》，大学大用“老三篇”，使广大党员提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，擦亮了眼睛，清除了一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，使党组织的面貌焕然一新，出现了一个朝气蓬勃的生动局面。
    毛主席的最新指示用极为生动的比喻，无比深刻地阐明了整党建党的深远意义。毛主席说：“一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”这是我们前进的方向和道路，也是目前摆在我们面前的一个艰巨的战斗任务。文化大革命中揭发出来的大量惊心动魄的阶级斗争事实告诉我们，能不能搞好整党建党工作，是关系到无产阶级专政能不能巩固，整个国家变色不变色的头等大事，是决定整个中国前途、世界命运的头等大事。我们决心紧紧依靠工人阶级，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，最广泛地联系最大多数的群众，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，把我们厂的党组织建设成为一个朝气蓬勃的、密切联系群众的、向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的无产阶级的先锋队组织！（附图片）
    毛主席关于整党建党的最新指示发表以后，驻北京建华化工厂的毛泽东思想宣传队积极组织群众学习讨论，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义建党路线。
