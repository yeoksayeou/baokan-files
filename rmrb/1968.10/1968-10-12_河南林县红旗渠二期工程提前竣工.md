The second phase of the Red Flag Canal project in Lin County, Henan, a massive undertaking, was recently completed ahead of schedule. This is a major achievement by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Lin County, who have been tempered through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production."

The second phase of the Red Flag Canal project mainly involved raising and strengthening a 120-li-long main canal. Upon the completion of this phase, the water intake capacity of the Red Flag Canal reached its designed level, making it possible to expand the irrigated area by more than 200,000 mu. This phase of the project was completed in just over three months, with unprecedented speed and quality in the history of water conservancy construction in Lin County.

Since 1960, the people of Lin County have followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture." With a revolutionary spirit to rearrange the mountains and rivers of Lin County, they have opened up mountains and valleys to bring water from the Zhang River up the mountains. In 1966, they completed the "artificial heaven river" Red Flag Canal, which winds through the Taihang Mountains for over 340 li, changing Lin County's previous condition of drought and water scarcity. Through the baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized in Lin County. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Lin County, with the boundless enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have launched a new high tide in water conservancy construction.

    河南林县红旗渠二期工程提前竣工
    河南省林县红旗渠规模宏大的第二期工程在最近提前竣工。这是经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的林县广大贫下中农，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针所取得的一项巨大成果。
    红旗渠第二期工程，主要是加高加固一百二十华里长的红旗渠总干渠。这期工程胜利建成后，使红旗渠的引水量达到了设计水平，可再扩大水浇地面积二十万亩以上。这期工程仅用了三个多月时间就胜利完成，其速度之快，质量之好，是林县水利建设史上从来没有过的。
    一九六○年以来，林县人民遵照毛主席“水利是农业的命脉”的教导，以重新安排林县河山的革命气概，开山辟岭，引漳河水上山，在一九六六年建成了盘回在太行山上，长达三百四十多华里的人造“天河”红旗渠，改变了林县过去十年九旱的干旱缺水面貌。经过无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，毛泽东思想在林县空前大普及，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的林县广大贫下中农，以在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，掀起了一个水利建设的新高潮。
