The working class is the true hero. Tianjin Iron and Steel Plant veteran worker Qi Xiu Rong, on the eve of his departure to Beijing to share his experience in successfully innovating a new process for hot-dip aluminum-titanium steel strip with relevant departments and personnel, received a reporter.

Four years ago, the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev spent tens of millions of yuan of state funds to purchase a so-called "world-class" new technology and equipment from a capitalist country and shipped it to Tianjin Iron and Steel Plant. Years of practice have proven that this foreign machine has low output, poor quality, high consumption, and high cost, producing nothing but waste. However, this foreign machine was revered by some famous "foreign" experts, "renowned" professors, and technical "authorities" as a treasure, praised to the skies. They formulated a set of "sacred and inviolable" rules for the workers. The Chinese working class would not accept this, would not follow their lead, and repeatedly proposed reasonable suggestions for modifying the foreign machine. Their revolutionary actions were met with countless obstacles from these "authorities," who said, "This is a new machine and equipment imported from abroad, others can't modify it, but you can?" Look! What a despicable attitude! Listen to the voice of the working class! Veteran worker Qi Xiu Rong angrily told them, "Foreign tigers are nothing to be afraid of. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, what others have, we also have; what others don't have, we will have."

The Chinese working class keeps their word, turns words into actions, and is determined to use Mao Zedong Thought to modify this foreign machine. Several years ago, veteran worker Qi Xiu Rong saw with his own eyes the waste produced by this foreign machine, causing the state to waste a large amount of funds and suffer huge losses. He recalled the bitter life of begging for food from Shandong to Tianjin in the dark old society and thought about the responsibility of the working class to be masters of the country today. Especially after undergoing the tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, veteran worker Qi Xiu Rong's heart was red, his will was firm, his eyes were clear, and his class consciousness greatly improved. He deeply realized that if he did not modify this foreign machine well and fight for the honor of the working class, he would be ungrateful to Chairman Mao. He and other worker comrades pledged loyalty in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, resolutely launched a technological revolution, and modified the foreign machine. Without any data or drawings, they bravely proposed plans to modify the process with a heart loyal to Chairman Mao.

When they tried every means to carry out the process modification, they were again obstructed by these technical "authorities." They did not support, did not provide equipment, did not provide manpower, and stood by watching the show. All this, veteran worker Qi Xiu Rong saw it with his own eyes and remembered it in his heart. He led other worker comrades to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on daring to struggle and daring to win, strengthened their confidence, eliminated interference, and continued the process modification experiments without interruption. However, the experiments failed time and time again. At this time, some people made cold jokes: "Qi is going to Beijing to see Chairman Mao!" ... Some even said in his face, "Without you, the earth wouldn't turn?"

At this time, the representative of the stationed PLA came to the experimental site, studied Chairman Mao's teachings with Qi Xiu Rong: "Failure is the mother of success," "Learn from failure," "Learn from failure, correct one's thoughts to adapt to the laws of the external world, and people can turn failure into success," and expressed firm support for him, encouraging him, "This process modification is a struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, a battle against the revisionist scientific and technological line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We, the working class, will use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, definitely be able to overcome difficulties, defeat difficulties, and achieve victory!" Chairman Mao's teachings, the support of the dear PLA, gave veteran worker Qi Xiu Rong boundless strength. At the same time, the revolutionary committee of the factory and the tripartite leading group of the workshop also provided timely and specific support and encouragement. He was full of confidence, led other worker comrades, summarized experience and lessons, and entered a new battle.

Just as they were achieving continuous victories, Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also constantly improve its political awareness in the struggle," was issued. Chairman Mao also personally received the workers' representatives from the capital. Qi Xiu Rong, on the experimental battlefield, heard Chairman Mao's voice from the radio, and was moved to tears. He said excitedly, "Chairman Mao is heart to heart with us, the working class. Chairman Mao supports us. We must make Chairman Mao proud, spur on our horses, and create new processes and technologies with world-advanced levels!" He led the entire team to overcome numerous difficulties in equipment and technology, after more than ten experiments, in just over a month, they mastered the technology monopolized by Japan, the American Empire, and the British Empire, successfully creating a new process and technology for Chinese-style hot-dip aluminum-titanium steel strip. The output and quality far surpassed Japan, the United States, and Britain, making China's hot-dip aluminum-titanium steel strip technology enter the ranks of world advanced technology.

"Count the heroes of the times, look at today." The true heroes are the working class with the most practical experience. They fear neither heaven nor earth, nor gods nor ghosts. Those "foreign" authorities, "foreign" doctrines, and "foreign" frameworks are all nonsense. All human miracles are created by the Chinese working class. This is the conclusion drawn from veteran worker Qi Xiu Rong's successful creation of a new process and technology for Chinese-style hot-dip aluminum-titanium steel strip. Let those who say the Chinese working class can't do this or that, at home and abroad, go to hell!

    工人阶级是真正的英雄
    天津轧钢一厂老工人齐秀荣，在动身前往北京向有关部门和有关人员介绍试制成功我国热镀铝钛钢带新工艺革新经验的前一天，接待了记者。
    四年前，中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人，花费了国家几十万元，从一个资本主义国家买进一台名曰世界新技术、新设备的“洋”机器，运到了天津轧钢一厂。几年来实践证明：这台洋机器，产量低，质量次，消耗大，成本高，制出来的东西是废物。可是，这台洋机器却被一些名牌的“洋”专家、“名”教授、技术“权威”奉为至宝，吹得神乎其神。他们给工人们制订了一套套神圣不可侵犯的“法规”。中国工人阶级硬是不买这个账，不理那一套，一再提出了改造“洋”机器的合理化建议。他们的革命行动，遭到了这班“权威”们的百般刁难，胡说什么：“这是从外国进口来的新机器、新设备，人家都改不成，你就能行？”看！多么可卑的奴才相！听听工人阶级的声音吧！老工人齐秀荣愤怒地对他们说：“洋老虎，没嘛了不起的，在毛主席领导下，外国有的，我们也有，外国没有的，我们也会有。”
    中国工人阶级说话是算数的，说到做到，决心用毛泽东思想改造这台“洋”机器。几年前，老工人齐秀荣，眼睁睁地看到这台“洋”机器生产出来的废物，给国家浪费大量资财，造成巨大的损失，早就心疼得慌。他想起黑暗的旧社会，从山东逃荒要饭到天津的悲惨生活的情景，想到今天我们工人阶级当家作主人的责任。特别是经过了这场无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，老工人齐秀荣心红志坚眼明，阶级觉悟大大地提高。他深深地认识到不把这台“洋”机器改造好，为工人阶级争口气，就对不起毛主席。他和其他工人同志在毛主席像前表忠心，坚决开展技术革命，改造“洋”机器。他们在没有资料和图纸的情况下，怀着一颗忠于毛主席的红心，开“诸葛亮”会，大胆提出改造工艺的方案。
    当他们千方百计进行工艺改造的时候，又遭到了这些技术“权威”们的阻拦。他们不支持，不给设备，不给人力，站在一旁看笑话。所有这些，老工人齐秀荣看在眼里，记在心里，他带领其他工人同志，反复地学习毛主席敢于斗争、敢于胜利的教导，增强了信心，排除了干扰，仍不间断地进行工艺改造实验。可是，试验一次一次都失败了，这时，一些人发出了一阵冷嘲热讽：“老齐要上北京见毛主席了！”……，有的还当着他的面冷言冷语，说什么：“离了你地球还不转？”……。
    这时，驻厂解放军代表亲临实验现场，和齐秀荣一起学习毛主席的教导：“失败者成功之母”，“吃一堑长一智”，“从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利”，表示坚决支持他，并鼓励他说：“这项工艺改造，是和帝、修、反的斗争，是向中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义科技路线开战，我们工人阶级用毛泽东思想为武器，一定能够克服困难，战胜困难，取得胜利！”毛主席的教导，亲人解放军的支持，给老工人齐秀荣增添了无穷的力量。同时，厂革委会、车间三结合领导小组，也及时地具体地给予支持和鼓励。他充满着信心，带领其他工人同志，总结经验教训，又进入了新的战斗。
    就在他们不断取得胜利的时候，毛主席的最新指示“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”发表了，毛主席又亲自接见了首都工人代表。齐秀荣在试验战场上，从广播里听到了毛主席的声音，激动得热泪盈眶。他万分激动地说：“毛主席他老人家和我们工人阶级心连心，最相信我们工人阶级。毛主席他老人家给我们撑腰，我们一定要给毛主席争气，快马加鞭，创造具有世界先进水平的新工艺！”他带领全组同志，克服了设备和技术的道道难关，经过了十多次的试验，仅用了一个多月的时间，就把日本、美帝、英帝所垄断的技术拿下来，成功地创造了中国式的热镀铝钛钢带的新工艺、新技术。产量、质量远远超过了日本、美国、英国，从而使我国热镀铝钛钢带的新技术跨进了世界先进的行列。
    “数风流人物，还看今朝。”真正的英雄，是最有实践经验的工人阶级，他们天不怕，地不怕，神不怕，鬼不怕，那些“洋”权威、“洋”教条、“洋”框框统统不在话下，一切人间奇迹都被中国工人阶级创造出来。这就是从老工人齐秀荣成功创造中国式热镀铝钛钢带新工艺、新技术所得出的结论，让国内外那些说中国工人阶级这也不行那也不行的人见鬼去吧！
