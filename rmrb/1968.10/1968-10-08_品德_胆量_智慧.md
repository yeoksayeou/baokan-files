The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Red Lantern" has perfectly created the heroic image of the railway worker Li Yuhang.

Li Yuhang is loyal to the revolution. In his struggle against the traitor Qiu Shanshan, who used both soft and hard tactics, he fully demonstrated the lofty revolutionary virtues of a Communist Party member. Li Yuhang devoted himself entirely to the revolution, fighting bravely for it, and even sacrificing his life for it.

Li Yuhang possesses great revolutionary courage. "I am a strong and brave man," he fears neither heaven nor earth, nor arrest, torture, imprisonment, nor sacrifice. At the moment of his execution, Li Yuhang was filled with revolutionary optimism, thinking: "After the storm, a hundred flowers bloom, the new China is like the morning sun, shining upon the world."

In his face-to-face struggle with the enemy, Li Yuhang not only showed a tenacious revolutionary will but also fully displayed the high wisdom of the working class. In the scene "Escape from the Soup Kitchen," he cleverly hid the secret code. In the scene "Attending the Banquet," he fought Qiu Shanshan so fiercely that "his eyes blurred, his head ached, his blood pressure rose, and his hands turned cold."

The glorious image of Li Yuhang is a powerful criticism of the "suffer a little loss to gain a big advantage" philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchev and the "love oneself" philosophy of the traitor.

The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Red Lantern" is praised by us railway workers because it passionately sings the praises of the virtues, courage, and wisdom of our working class.

Such revolutionary model operas, whether for new workers or old workers, are deeply educational. Old workers feel that their revolutionary will is more vigorous and that they are getting younger and younger. They want to maintain their revolutionary integrity, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and swear to carry the revolution through to the end. Young workers feel that they must learn from revolutionary predecessors, take up the revolutionary baton, never forget their roots, and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

    品德·胆量·智慧
    北京铁路局丰台机务段工人　李昆麓
    《红灯记》十分完美地塑造了铁路工人李玉和的英雄形象。
    李玉和为革命忠心耿耿。他在与贼鸠山的软硬兼施的斗争中，充分表现了一个共产党员的崇高的革命品德。李玉和一心为革命，一切为革命，为革命他英勇奋斗，甚至不惜献出了自己的生命。
    李玉和有着大无畏的革命胆量。“孩儿我本是个刚强铁汉”，他天不怕地不怕，不怕被捕，不怕受刑，不怕坐牢，不怕牺牲。在就义的时候，李玉和满怀革命的乐观主义精神，他想的是：“风雨过，百花吐艳，新中国，似朝阳，光照人间。”
    李玉和在同敌人面对面的斗争中，不仅具有顽强的革命意志，而且充分显示了工人阶级的高度智慧。在“粥棚脱险”一场，他机智地藏起了密电码。在“赴宴”一场中，他把鸠山斗得“眼发花来头发胀，血压增高手冰凉”。
    李玉和的光辉形象，对中国赫鲁晓夫“吃小亏占大便宜”的市侩哲学和“钟爱自己”的叛徒哲学是有力的批判。
    革命现代京剧《红灯记》，所以受到我们铁路工人的赞美，就是因为它热情地歌颂了我们工人阶级的品德、胆量和智慧。
    这样的革命样板戏，我们铁路工人，无论是新工人或是老工人，看了以后都深受教育。老工人感到革命意志更加旺盛、越活越年轻，要保持革命晚节，无限忠于毛主席，誓把革命进行到底。青年工人感到一定要向革命前辈学习，接好革命班，世世代代不忘本，永远跟着毛主席干革命。
