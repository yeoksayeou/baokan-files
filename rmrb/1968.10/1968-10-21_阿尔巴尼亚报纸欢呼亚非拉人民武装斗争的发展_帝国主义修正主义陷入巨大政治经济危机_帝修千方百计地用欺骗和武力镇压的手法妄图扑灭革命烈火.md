Albanian newspaper *Zeri i Popullit* on October 20th published a commentary, enthusiastically hailing the vigorous development of the armed struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which have struck a fatal blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The commentary said that in recent times, the armed struggles of the peoples of various countries have achieved important victories. The struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly exposing the weakness of imperialism and its lackeys, and demonstrating the peoples' determination to fight and win.

The commentary recounted the great victories of the armed struggles of the peoples of Thailand, Burma, Laos, Palestine, Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea-Bissau, and said that the revolutionary struggles of the armed peoples of various countries have dealt imperialism and revisionism blow after blow. Due to the development of these struggles, imperialism and revisionism are falling into a huge political and economic crisis. The imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists know that the upsurge of the revolution will accelerate their doom. Therefore, they are resorting to deception propaganda and armed suppression in every possible way to try to extinguish the flames of revolution.

The commentary concluded by pointing out that the armed struggles of the peoples of various countries are continually expanding and strengthening, achieving one victory after another, and will inevitably lead to the final victory of the peoples of various countries, and to the thorough defeat of U.S. imperialism and its various lackeys.

    短评叙述了泰国、缅甸、老挝、巴勒斯坦、莫三鼻给、安哥拉和几内亚（比绍）等国和地区的人民武装斗争的巨大胜利之后说，手拿武器的各国人民的革命斗争的烈火，给了帝国主义和修正主义一个又一个的沉重打击。由于这一斗争的发展，帝国主义和修正主义正在陷入一场巨大的政治和经济的危机。帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者懂得，革命的高涨将会加速他们的灭亡。因此，他们从进行欺骗宣传到进行武力镇压，千方百计地企图扑灭革命火焰。
