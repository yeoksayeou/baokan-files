At the foot of the Greater Khingan Mountains, there is an aerial antenna that stretches across the sky. Comrades call it the "Criticize Revisionism" line.

The story goes like this: One morning, an important document was transmitted via radio waves to a temporary wireless station here on an urgent mission. The telegraph machine immediately started clicking urgently, "click, click, clack, clack." Suddenly, the electromagnetic waves could not be transmitted, and the antenna was blown off by a strong wind. Normally, it takes only twenty minutes to set up an antenna, but this time, the wire had to be pulled out from the pulley at the top of the pole. The pole was high, the wind was strong, and several telegraph operators lacked the technical skills to climb the pole, making it quite difficult to reconnect the antenna. The telegraph operators and the station chief looked at the blown-off antenna, frustrated and rubbing their hands. What to do? If the antenna was not reconnected immediately, it would affect the timely transmission and implementation of the battle orders from the Proletarian Headquarters. Some comrades, facing the difficulties, felt the hardship and danger. At this moment, the station chief realized that this showed that the bourgeois worldview spread by the Chinese Khrushchev had not been thoroughly eliminated from people's minds. It was necessary to launch a revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the fusion of public and private interests" and eliminating its poisonous influence. Thus, a criticism meeting was held at the base of the antenna pole.

The station chief fired the first shot. He said, "To be a Communist Party member and a revolutionary soldier, one must definitely 'take revolutionary interests as one's first life.' But the Chinese Khrushchev blathers on about 'public and private interests coexisting, public first, private second,' which is a narcotic that corrupts people's souls. We must thoroughly smash it."

As soon as the station chief's words fell, telegraph operator Ma Baoyu, holding the Little Red Book, excitedly said, "We must be good soldiers of Chairman Mao and be like Zhang Side and Lei Feng, completely and thoroughly devoted to the revolution. The Chinese Khrushchev's 'theory of the fusion of public and private interests' is essentially about allowing only private interests and not public interests, paving the way for his restoration of capitalism. We must resolutely sweep the 'private' character out the door and not give it any room to exist."

The more the criticism meeting went on, the more intense the firepower became. The more they criticized, the higher the comrades' awareness of the two-line struggle became, the more fearless of sacrifice, the more determined to overcome all difficulties, and the more resolute they were to reconnect the antenna. Everyone held the Little Red Book and swore to the great leader Chairman Mao, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will forever remember your teachings. We are determined to struggle for the proletarian revolutionary cause for life, not to live for the 'private' character." Thus, everyone volunteered to climb the pole and reconnect the line. Telegraph operator Ma Baoyu took the lead, holding onto the pole, saying, "This line is a test of our worldview as revolutionary soldiers, a heavy artillery shell to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev." Before one could say "go," he summoned his courage, stepped into the stirrups, and started climbing the pole. When he was about two meters away from the top, the strong wind swayed the pole back and forth, and he was in danger of falling at any moment. When he heard the comrades below shouting the slogans, "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" "Resolutely determined, fearless of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, strive for victory," he was full of energy. He continued to climb up, feeling that every step he climbed was a powerful criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of "private" character. Finally, he reconnected the antenna, making the red radio signals jump again, ensuring that the battle orders from the Proletarian Headquarters were transmitted and implemented smoothly. From then on, the comrades called this antenna the "Criticize Revisionism" line.

    一条“批修线”
    在大兴安岭山脚下，有一条凌空飞架的天线，同志们都管它叫“批修线”。
    事情原来是这样的：一天上午，一份重要文件由电波传到了在这里临时执行紧急任务的无线电电台。电报机马上急促地“的的，达达”地叫了起来。忽然间电磁波发射不出去了，天线被狂风刮断了。一般架一根天线二十分钟就够了，可是这次接线，钢丝要从杆顶的滑轮里脱出来，杆高、风大，加上几名报务员没有爬杆的技术，要接上天线确实有很大的困难。报务员和台长看着被刮断的天线，急得直搓手。怎么办？如果不立即把天线接上，会影响无产阶级司令部战斗号令的及时传达贯彻。有的同志面对困难，感到艰难和危险。这时，台长认识到，这说明中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的资产阶级世界观在人们的头脑里还没有得到彻底肃清，必须开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化论”，肃清其流毒。于是就在天线杆底下召开了批判会。
    台长开了第一炮。他说：“做一个共产党员、革命战士，就一定要“以革命利益为第一生命”。可是中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“大公有私，公私兼顾，先公后私”，这是腐蚀人的灵魂的麻醉剂。我们一定要彻底把它砸烂。”
    台长的话音刚落，报务员马宝玉手捧红色宝书，激动地说：“我们要做毛主席的好战士，就要象张思德、雷锋那样完全彻底干革命。中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化论”，实质上就是只许为私不能为公，为他复辟资本主义开辟道路。我们坚决把“私”字扫地出门，不给一点生存的余地。”
    批判会越开火力越猛；越批判，同志们两条路线斗争觉悟提得越高，不怕牺牲，排除万难，把天线接上的决心越大。大家手捧宝书向伟大领袖毛主席宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！你老人家的教导我们永远牢记。我们决心做到为无产阶级革命事业奋斗终生，不为“私”字活生命。”于是个个争先报名爬杆接线。报务员马宝玉抢先把住了杆子，说：“这条线是对我们革命战士世界观的检验，是批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一发重型炮弹。”说时迟，那时快，他鼓足勇气，踩上脚扣顺着杆子往上爬。当他爬到离杆顶只有两米远的时候，大风吹得杆子东摇西摆，随时都有摔下来的危险。当他听到下边同志们喊起了
  “打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的口号声时，浑身是劲，于是他就继续向上爬，他觉得每爬一步都是对中国赫鲁晓夫“私”字哲学的有力批判。终于把天线接上，使红色的电波信号又重新跳动起来，保证了无产阶级司令部的战斗号令畅通无阻地传达和贯彻。从此，同志们就把这条天线叫做“批修线”。
