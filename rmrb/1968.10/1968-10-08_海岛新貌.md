On the frontlines of the Yellow Sea, there is a small island known as Haiyang Island. Haiyang Island is far from the mainland and far from the capital, Beijing. However, the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has also swept across this small island, bringing about tremendous changes. Every word of Chairman Mao's is echoed on this tiny island. The countless ordinary stories of Haiyang Island make visitors feel refreshed.

Where do the fishing boats sail to?

After the production drums of the spring fishing season began to beat, the fishermen of the Haiyang Commune's motor-sailboat brigade set sail. The early spring in the northern seas of the motherland is still cold and windy. The water splashing onto the deck quickly freezes into ice. The fishermen of the Haiyang Commune have overcome the difficulties of the cold and strong winds, achieving a great victory in their first battle. After setting sail, they harvested a bumper catch in their first round, with each pair of fishing boats catching over 70,000 jin (approximately 35,000 kg) per voyage. The fishermen were all smiling with joy.

The motor-sailboat fleet, loaded with the caught small white fish, was heading towards the port of Shandong. Suddenly, someone suggested:

"Captain, why don't we take the fish to Dalian? The purchase price there is higher than in Shandong, and we can sell the fish for an additional two fen per jin. For our 500,000 jin of fish, we can earn an additional 10,000 yuan!"

Someone inside the boat agreed: "Yes! If we take the fish to Dalian, we can increase the income for the commune members. If we send the fish to Shandong, it's like throwing 10,000 yuan into the sea!"

This question made the captain of the motor-sailboat brigade, Liu Minglong, pause. He thought: No, this involves a struggle between two lines. The brigade leadership group immediately organized a class to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forget class struggle" and "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." They combined this with the facts of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in their commune and brigade, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize and expose the revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the fishery sector.

Old fisherman Sun Yunxian said: "The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our commune advocate 'production responsibility to the boat' and 'bonus for production,' using 'material incentives' to develop production. The result is not only that production has not developed, but it has also led to polarization, with the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer. The Chinese Khrushchev is doing this to make us poor fishermen suffer twice and endure hardships twice!"

When it came to "production responsibility to the boat," the fishermen were furious. They said: In the past, with "production responsibility to the boat," everyone only cared about themselves. Sometimes, when they found a good fishing ground, they would hide if they saw other boats coming, fearing that others would catch the fish. They would make others think there were no fish here, and after others left, they would come back to catch the fish themselves. This caused tension between boats and between communes. This was all due to the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's "production responsibility to the boat." We must never go back to the old road again.

Captain Liu said: "Sending the fish to Shandong, although the purchase price is lower, we can return here in seven or eight hours, thus catching more fish for the country. We earn a little less, but it is worth it. Sending the fish to Dalian, although we can earn more money, it takes four or five days round trip. If we miss the opportunity, the fish will swim away, and we won't be able to catch any, causing great losses to the country."

A struggle session on criticizing selfishness and revisionism on the fishing boat ended. The fishermen sang "The Great Helmsman Steers Us On" and happily sailed towards the port of Weihai in Shandong.

The Old Fisherman's Advice

One day, the director of the Haiyang Commune Revolutionary Committee and former Party Secretary, Wang Youcang, crossed the big ridge to the Weizi Gully production brigade. As soon as he arrived at Weizi Gully, he met an old man.

"Who are you?" the old man asked.

"Grandpa, don't you recognize me?" Wang Youcang replied.

"I seem to have seen you somewhere, but I can't remember!" the old man said.

Wang Youcang sighed deeply and said to the old man: "Grandpa, I was poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev in the past, and I didn't come down often. I will definitely change in the future!"

"Catch fish and shrimp, not revolutionization." This was the sharp criticism of the revolutionary masses of Haiyang Commune at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Because he did not emphasize proletarian politics and had little contact with the masses, the masses had complaints about him. During this Cultural Revolution, he was severely criticized.

The criticism from the revolutionary masses was a great help to Wang Youcang. However, he never expected that when the commune established the Revolutionary Committee, the masses still combined with him and even let him be the first in command. In Weizi Gully, an old woman saw him and asked a young girl: "Is he the person in charge of our commune?" "Yes!" "Tell him not to take the wrong path in the future, but to lead us on the correct path of socialism!"

Wang Youcang left Weizi Gully with a warm heart. He then went to Jinfu Gully to visit the 78-year-old poor old fisherman Liu Lishan and slept on the same kang (heated brick bed) with the old man. Wang Youcang's new style made the old man talkative all night, from how the fishermen of this island suffered under the Japanese devils, the Kuomintang, and the fishery tyrants in the old society, to the changes on the island in the new society. He repeatedly advised Wang Youcang to hold power well and use power well for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and not to let the poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice.

The old fisherman's sincere expectations deeply educated Wang Youcang. Originally, Wang Youcang had the thought of not wanting to be a cadre, fearing to make mistakes again and be criticized again. Now, he realized that fearing was the same as not wanting to continue the revolution, the same as being a deserter in the face of difficulties, and the same as being disloyal to Chairman Mao. This cadre, who had been a child worker for ten years in the old society, decided to follow Chairman Mao to the end and never look back under the education of the masses.

"The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." After Wang Youcang returned from this deep immersion in the masses, he immediately convened a meeting of the commune Revolutionary Committee. At the meeting, it was decided that except for one person on duty in rotation, all other members would go deep into the grassroots. After this new revolutionary system was established, the cadres of Haiyang Commune began to show a revolutionary work style. In the past, the old Party Committee of the commune were all onshore, directing fishing boat production, and at most went to the near sea with the boats. Now, some members of the Revolutionary Committee have already gone to sea long-term with the deep-sea fishing boats.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted the revolutionization of the thoughts and styles of the cadres of Haiyang Commune. They began to go deep into the masses and received praise from the broad poor fishermen. Some old fishermen said: "The commune cadres are working with us poor and lower-middle peasants. With such people in power, we are at ease!"

The Most Precious Gift

The military and civilians are united as one, who can defeat us? The relationship between the military and civilians on Haiyang Island is truly like fish and water, with the military and civilians "eating from the same well, living in the same village," going out to sea to catch fish together, and standing guard together. Especially since the Cultural Revolution, the military and civilians have implemented "political joint defense," with the military going deep into the masses to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and the military and civilians studying Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions together, and jointly carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle. Now, on Haiyang Island, on the beaches, boat decks, fields, and kangs, you can often see soldiers and civilians sitting together, holding the precious books, and discussing passionately.

Newly enlisted soldiers, as soon as they set foot on this island, are welcomed with drums and gongs by the masses. When old soldiers are demobilized and leave this island, the masses bid them farewell with tears, often crossing mountains and valleys for more than ten li (approximately 5 kilometers), all the way to the seaside wharf, still reluctant to part. This island is famous for producing sea cucumbers and abalone. In the past, when old soldiers were demobilized, the masses would definitely give them a few jin of sea cucumbers and abalone to express their goodwill. Now, the masses give the demobilized soldiers Mao Zedong's works as the most precious gift. The soldiers, after returning to various parts of the country, often send red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Old Five Articles," golden Mao badges, and exquisite paper cuts with "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!" to the masses.

The island residents also tell a story: In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the supply and marketing cooperative of the commune suddenly called the production brigade of Linghou Dazhai to send two commune members to pick up books. The two commune members went to the supply and marketing cooperative and found out that it was fifty sets of golden "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

The two commune members were surprised and said: "Didn't you make a mistake? Our brigade did not order 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.'"

The service staff of the supply and marketing cooperative said: "No mistake! The book fee of 100 yuan has been paid, and it was paid by a soldier, saying it was for the Weizi Gully small brigade, one set per household. He did not want to say his name; he only remembered that he was short, dark-skinned, about 16 or 17 years old, and had a Sichuan accent."

The books were distributed to every household in Weizi Gully, and everyone was moved by the precious book sent by the unnamed soldier. Some said: "Year after year, month after month, we finally got the precious book from Beijing, far away across mountains and rivers, to our island." Some said: "We have run to the supply and marketing cooperative many times but have not bought 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' Today, the precious book came to the small island for the first time, and we each got a set." They all expressed their determination at the book distribution meeting, saying they would definitely study Chairman Mao's works well and actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The soldier who sent the books was finally found. He was Pu Zifu, a new soldier of a certain company of the garrison unit. He usually studied Chairman Mao's works very hard. However, in the past, due to the control of the capitalist roaders over the cultural publishing sector, the publication of Chairman Mao's works was suppressed, making it difficult for the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers to buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Pu Zifu's company only had three or five sets. As for the production brigades, it was even harder to see them. After the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's works began to be printed in large quantities. Pu Zifu thought that the fishermen needed "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and we revolutionary soldiers should do our best to help them solve the problem. When he learned that the supply and marketing cooperative had a new batch of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," he took out all the 100 yuan of his allowance he had saved since enlisting and bought 50 sets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" for the fishermen.

The fishermen of Weizi Gully said: "The soldiers gave us the most precious gift. We will treat 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' as a family heirloom and pass it down from generation to generation."

### 海岛新貌

    海岛新貌
    在祖国的黄海前哨，有一个小岛——海洋岛。海洋岛远离大陆，远离祖国的首都北京。但是，无产阶级文化大革命的风暴同样席卷了这个小岛，使这个小岛发生了巨大的变化。毛主席的每一句话都在这小小的海岛得到回声。海洋岛的许许多多平凡的故事，都使登上海岛的人感到耳目一新。
    渔船驶到那个港去？
    春汛生产的战鼓擂响以后，海洋公社机帆大队的渔民扬帆出海了。
    祖国北部海域的早春，还是寒风凛冽，迎面扑来的水花，落到甲板上，很快就会结成冰块。海洋公社的渔民战胜了天冷风大等重重困难，首战告捷，出海后的第一个回合就夺得了一个大丰收，每对渔船一个航次产量达到七万多斤。渔民们个个喜笑颜开。
    机帆船队满载着捕捞的小白鱼往山东大陆的港口驶去。这时突然有人倡议说：
    “队长，咱们的鱼还是送到大连去吧，那里的收购价格要比山东高，每斤鱼多卖二分钱，咱们五十多万斤鱼就可以多卖一万多块钱呀！”
    坐在船里的一个人附和说：“是呀！咱们到大连卖鱼，可以多为社员增加收入。要是把鱼送到山东去，那不等于把一万多块钱扔到海里去了吗？”
    这个问题使机帆队长刘明龙愣了一下。他一想：不对，这里面有两条道路的斗争。大队领导小组针对这种情况，立即开办毛泽东思想学习班，全体出海渔民学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，“要斗私，批修”的教导，结合本公社和本大队两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大量事实，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在水产战线上推行的修正主义路线。
    老渔民孙云先说：“中国赫鲁晓夫和他在咱公社的代理人，鼓吹什么‘包产到船’‘见产提成’，就是用‘物质刺激’的方法发展生产，结果不但生产没有发展，反而搞成两极分化，贫的越贫，富的越富。中国赫鲁晓夫这样做就是要叫咱贫苦渔民吃二遍苦，受二茬罪！”
    提到“包产到船”，渔民的气都来了。他们说：过去“包产到船”，只顾自己，有时发现好的渔场，看到别人的船来了，怕别人来打这些鱼，就故意躲开，使别人误以为这里没有鱼，等别人走了以后自己回来再打。这样造成了船与船之间、公社与公社之间的紧张关系。这都是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“包产到船”的毒害。我们千万再别走过去的老路了。
    刘队长说：“把鱼送到山东去，虽然收购的价格低一些，但七、八个小时可以返回到这里，这样可以为国家多打鱼。我们自己少收入一点，这也是值得的。把鱼送到大连去，虽然可多卖一些钱，但来回得四、五天时间，时机一过，鱼群跑了，打不到鱼，就给国家造成很大的损失。”
    一场渔船上的斗私批修讲用会结束了，渔民们高唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，愉快地向山东威海港驶去。
    老渔工的嘱咐
    有一天，海洋公社革委会主任、前党委书记王有堂，翻过大岭到苇子沟生产队去。刚到苇子沟，遇上一位老大爷。
    “你是谁呀？”老大爷问。
    “老大爷，你不认识我吗？”王有堂回答说。
    “我好象在哪儿恍恍惚惚地见过你，记不得啦！”老大爷说。
    王有堂深有感慨地向老大爷说：“大爷，过去我中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，下来少，以后一定改！”
    “抓鱼抓虾，不抓革命化”。这是文化大革命开始后，海洋公社革命群众对王有堂的尖锐批评。就因为不突出无产阶级政治，联系群众少，群众对他有意见，在这次文化大革命中，狠狠地给他烧了一把火。
    革命群众的批评，是对王有堂的巨大帮助。可是他万没有想到：公社成立革委会的时候，群众还是结合了他，而且还让他当第一把手。在苇子沟，一位老大娘见了他，问一位姑娘：“他是不是咱公社掌大权的那个人呀？”“是呀！”“你告诉他，以后不要走偏道，可要领着咱们走社会主义的正道！”
    王有堂离开苇子沟，心里热乎乎的，他又到金家沟去登门拜访七十八岁的贫苦老渔工刘立山，和老汉同睡一个炕。王有堂的新作风使老汉一晚上兴致勃勃，话特别多，从这个海岛的渔民过去如何受日本鬼子、国民党、渔霸的欺压，一直说到海岛在新社会的变化。他一再嘱咐王有堂要为贫下中农掌好权、用好权，不让贫下中农吃二遍苦。
    老渔工殷切的期望，使王有堂深受教育。本来，王有堂有不愿当干部的活思想，怕再犯错误，怕再受批判。现在，他认识到：“怕”字当头，就是不想继续革命，就是在困难面前当逃兵，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。这个在旧社会当了十年童工的干部，在群众的教育下，决心紧跟毛主席，革命到底不回头。
    “国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”王有堂从这次深入群众回来以后，立即召开了公社革委会会议，会上规定了除轮流一人值班以外，其他成员一律深入基层。在这个新的革命化的制度订立后，海洋公社干部开始出现了革命化的工作作风。过去公社旧党委都在岸上，指挥渔船生产，至多随船到近海，现在革委会有的成员已经随着远洋渔船长期出海了。
    无产阶级文化大革命，促进了海洋公社干部思想、作风的革命化。他们开始深入群众，受到了广大贫苦渔民的赞扬。有的老渔工说：“公社干部和咱贫下中农一样干啦，有这样的人掌权，我们就放心啦！”
    最珍贵的礼物
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？海洋岛上的军民关系，真正是鱼和水一样亲，军民“同吃一井水，同住一个村”，一同出海打鱼，一同站岗放哨。尤其是文化大革命以来，军队和群众实行了“政治联防”，军队深入群众宣传毛泽东思想，军民一同学习毛主席著作和最新指示，一同搞革命大批判。现在，在海洋岛上，在滩头、船头、田头、炕头，经常可以看到战士和群众坐在一起，手捧宝书，讨论得热火朝天。
    新入伍的战士一登上这个岛，就受到群众敲锣打鼓的欢迎。老战士复员，要离开这个岛了，群众都含泪相送，往往要翻山越岭地送上十几里地，一直送到海滩码头，还依依不舍。这个岛以产海参、鲍鱼闻名。过去，老战士复员时，群众一定要送上几斤海参、鲍鱼，表示心意。而现在，群众都把毛主席著作作为最珍贵的礼物送给复员的战士。战士们回到祖国各地后，也经常给群众寄来红彤彤的《毛主席语录》、《毛泽东选集》、“老五篇”、金光闪闪的毛主席像章、精巧的“毛主席万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”的剪纸。
    海岛居民还传诵着这样一个故事：文化大革命初期，岭后大队苇子沟小队队部忽然接到公社供销社的电话，叫他们派两个社员去取书。两个社员到了供销社一看，原来是五十套金光闪闪的《毛泽东选集》。
    两个社员很奇怪，说：“你们弄错了吧？我们小队没有订购《毛泽东选集》。”
    供销社的服务员说：“没有错！书款一百元已付清了，是一个解放军战士付的，说是给苇子沟小队送去，每户一套。他不肯说自己的名字；只记得模样是个小个儿，黑黑的，约莫十六、七岁，四川口音。”
    书发到苇子沟每户渔民家里了，大家捧着那位不知名的战士赠送的宝书，心里非常激动。有的说：“年年盼，月月盼，终于把宝书从远隔千山万水的北京盼到了咱们岛。”有的说：“我们跑了好多次供销社，也没买到《毛泽东选集》，今天这部宝书头一次来小岛，想不到我们每户一套。”他们在授宝书的大会上，都纷纷表示决心，一定要努力学好毛主席著作，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命。
    那位送书的战士最后也查出来了。他就是守岛部队某连新战士莆自福。他平时十分努力学习毛主席著作。但是，过去由于走资派控制了文化出版部门，压制毛主席著作的发行，使广大工农兵买不到《毛泽东选集》。莆自福所在连队也不过只有三、五套。至于生产队就更看不见了。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，毛主席著作才开始大量印行。莆自福想到渔民非常需要《毛泽东选集》，我们革命战士就应该想尽一切办法帮助他们解决。当他知道供销社新到了一批《毛泽东选集》的时候，就把入伍以来节约下来的一百元津贴费全部拿了出来，给渔民买了五十套《毛泽东选集》。
    苇子沟的渔民说：“解放军战士给我们送来了最珍贵的礼物，我们要把《毛泽东选集》当作传家宝，世世代代传下去。”
