Washington's black residents took to the streets in violent protest on the night of October 8, denouncing the arbitrary killing of a black youth by U.S. police.

On the night of October 8, near the White House, U.S. police found an excuse to shoot and kill an innocent black youth. This new fascist crime by the U.S. reactionary ruling clique has aroused the strong indignation of Washington's black residents, who immediately took to the streets in protest and demonstration in the city's commercial district. Many angry black youths also smashed some shops owned by white racists.

The panic-stricken U.S. reactionary ruling clique immediately dispatched a large number of police and "riot control" forces, firing tear gas at the black crowd and carrying out savage repression. At the same time, they stationed a large number of reserve forces in the city stadium, preparing to launch an even larger-scale repression of blacks at any time. However, the black masses were fearless and bravely fought back against the police, despite the tear gas.
