	Protesting Monopoly Capital Exploitation, Fearless of Reactionary Government Threats

	Over 70,000 American Dock Workers Go on Strike

	Xinhua News Agency reports from Washington: Despite threats and sabotage from the U.S. reactionary government, over 75,000 dock workers on the U.S. East Coast went on strike on October 1st. They are protesting the exploitation of monopoly capital and demanding wage increases. This strike has once again dealt a powerful blow to the U.S. ruling class.

	The strike by U.S. dock workers has brought all loading and unloading work in ports from Maine to Texas on the East Coast to a halt. Hundreds of ships are stranded, severely disrupting the transportation of U.S. imperialist supplies to Vietnam and causing the U.S. to lose $7 million daily in import and export trade.

	Due to the U.S. reactionary ruling class's intensified aggression and war policies, inflation is rampant in the U.S., prices are soaring, and workers' real wages are continuously declining. Additionally, monopoly capitalists are forcing through so-called "automation," threatening many dock workers with unemployment. This situation has inevitably provoked the resistance of U.S. dock workers.

	The U.S. reactionary ruling class is terrified of this strike by U.S. dock workers and is doing everything in its power to sabotage it. In late September, U.S. President Johnson dispatched Deputy Labor Secretary Reynolds to New York to suppress the strike. On September 30th, the eve of the strike, Johnson hastily ordered the establishment of a three-person "investigative committee" to create public opinion for suppressing the strike. However, the U.S. dock workers paid no heed to Johnson's various threats and sabotage and went on strike on October 1st. This fully demonstrates the fighting spirit of U.S. workers.

    抗议垄断资本压榨　不怕反动政府威胁
    美国七万多码头工人大罢工
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国东海岸七万五千多名码头工人不顾美国反动政府的威胁和破坏，于十月一日举行大罢工，抗议垄断资本的压榨，要求增加工资。这次罢工再一次给了美国统治集团以有力的打击。
    美国码头工人的这次大罢工，使美国东海岸从缅因州到得克萨斯州的所有海港的装卸货工作全部停顿，有几百条船只受困，不仅严重地影响了美帝侵越物资的运输，而且每天要使美国在进出口贸易方面损失七千万美元。
    由于美国反动统治集团加紧推行侵略政策和战争政策，美国国内通货膨胀，物价飞涨，工人实际工资不断下降，再加上垄断资本家强迫推行所谓“自动化”，许多码头工人面临失业的威胁。这种状况不能不引起美国码头工人的反抗。
    美国反动统治集团对美国码头工人的这次大罢工怕得要命，千方百计地加以破坏。九月下旬，美国总统约翰逊曾派劳工部副部长雷诺兹赶往纽约进行压制，九月三十日，在大罢工即将开始的前夜，约翰逊又急急忙忙下令设立了一个三人“调查委员会”，为镇压这次大罢工制造舆论。可是美国码头工人不理约翰逊的种种威胁和破坏，在十月一日举行了这次大罢工。这充分显示了美国工人的战斗精神。
