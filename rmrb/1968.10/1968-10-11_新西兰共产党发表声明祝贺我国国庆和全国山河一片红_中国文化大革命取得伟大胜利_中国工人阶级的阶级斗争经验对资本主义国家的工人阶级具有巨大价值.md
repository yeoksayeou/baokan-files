	New Zealand Communist Party Issues Statement Congratulating Our National Day and Celebrating the Redness of the Entire Nation

	The Great Victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution

	The Experience of the Chinese Working Class in Class Struggle Has Enormous Value for the Working Class in Capitalist Countries

	WELLINGTON, Oct. 9 (New China News Agency) — The National Secretariat of the New Zealand Communist Party issued a statement on Oct. 7, warmly congratulating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the great victory of the establishment of revolutionary committees in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of mainland China.

	The statement said: "October 1 is the day China was liberated from oppression. This day is of great significance to the Chinese people and to the people of all countries.

		"This year's celebration—the 19th anniversary—is marked by the achievement of a great new victory, namely, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

	The statement said: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have established revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except Taiwan. These committees, composed of representatives of the revolutionary masses, the army, and revolutionary cadres, are new organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the power of the working class. The establishment of these committees has greatly strengthened the power of the working class and ensured that China remains a bastion of socialism. The New Zealand Communist Party and all progressive people congratulate the Chinese people on this historic achievement. At this historic moment, this achievement is of even greater significance because the current leaders of the Soviet Union have restored capitalism in the Soviet Union and betrayed socialist principles.

	The statement said: "The experience of the Soviet Union shows that even decades after the establishment of socialism, capitalism can still be restored. The means of this restoration is revisionism, that is, cooperation with the bourgeoisie using communist phrases.

		"Revisionism is the Trojan horse of the highest stage of capitalism, imperialism. If the working class and the Communist Party relax their vigilance in class struggle, revisionism will grow within the Communist Party, whether under capitalist or socialist conditions. The Chinese Cultural Revolution has defeated domestic revisionism and closed the door to any restoration of capitalism there."

	The statement said: "The experience of the Chinese working class and people in class struggle is an extremely important part of the experience of the international working-class movement. It has enormous value for the working class in capitalist countries like New Zealand.

		"The working class is the leading class in the revolutionary struggle against capitalism and imperialism. The greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, has greatly enriched the theory of this revolutionary struggle—Marxism-Leninism.

		"Today's Marxist-Leninists demand that the people learn from Mao Zedong Thought and learn from the experience of the Chinese revolution to arm themselves for the victorious class struggle.

		"The 19th anniversary of the founding of China is indeed a historic day."

    新西兰共产党发表声明祝贺我国国庆和全国山河一片红
    中国文化大革命取得伟大胜利
    中国工人阶级的阶级斗争经验对资本主义国家的工人阶级具有巨大价值
    新华社惠灵顿九日电　新西兰共产党全国书记处七日发表声明，热烈祝贺中华人民共和国成立十九周年和全中国除台湾省外的二十九个省、市、自治区全部成立革命委员会的伟大胜利。
    声明说：“十月一日是中国从压迫下获得解放的日子。这个日子对于中国人民和各国人民都具有十分重大的意义。
      “今年的节日——十九周年的特征是取得了伟大的新的成就，即无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。”
    声明说：在中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，中国人民在除台湾省外的各省、市、自治区全部成立了革命委员会。由革命群众的代表、军队的代表和革命干部的代表组成的这些委员会是工人阶级的政权、无产阶级专政的新的机构。这些委员会的建立大大加强了工人阶级的政权，从而保证中国依然是社会主义的堡垒。新西兰共产党和一切进步人士向中国人民祝贺这一具有历史意义的成就。在这个历史时刻，因为苏联现任领导人在苏联实行资本主义复辟，背叛了社会主义原则，这种成就具有更为重要的意义。
    声明说：“苏联的经验表明，甚至在建立社会主义几十年之后，资本主义仍有可能复辟。实行这种复辟的手段是修正主义，即用共产主义的词句同资产阶级实行合作。
    “修正主义是资本主义的最高阶段帝国主义的特洛伊木马。如果工人阶级和共产党放松阶级斗争的警惕，修正主义就会在共产党内滋长起来，不管是在资本主义条件下还是在社会主义条件下。中国的文化革命打败了国内的修正主义，为资本主义在那里的任何复辟关上了大门。”
    声明说：“中国工人阶级和中国人民的阶级斗争的经验是国际工人阶级运动的经验的非常重要的一部分。它对象新西兰这样的资本主义国家的工人阶级有巨大的价值。
    “工人阶级是反对资本主义和帝国主义的革命斗争的领导阶级。当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席大大丰富了这个革命斗争的理论——马克思列宁主义。
    “今天的马克思列宁主义者要求人民学习毛泽东思想和学习中国革命的经验，以便把自己武装起来胜利地进行阶级斗争。
    “中国成立十九周年确实是具有历史意义的节日。”
