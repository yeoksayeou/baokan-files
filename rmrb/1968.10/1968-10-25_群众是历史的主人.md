Title: The Masses Are the Masters of History

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The fundamental principle of the Communist Party is to rely directly on the broad revolutionary masses." This is a new development of Marxism-Leninism's theory of party building, and it is the fundamental direction for party building.

The Chinese Khrushchev openly opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian line of party building, vigorously advocating the "theory of the backwardness of the masses," and absurdly claiming that "scatteredness, conservatism, narrow-mindedness, backwardness, and the idea of private property" are the "characteristics of the peasant class." In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, the masses are all "idiots" and "mob," and only he himself is the "savior" and "Zhuge Liang." Pfft! It's truly shameful that he has no sense of shame! This is the theoretical basis for his consistent pursuit of the bourgeois reactionary line, and it is a complete exposure of his bourgeois reactionary worldview.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." The working class and poor and lower-middle peasants are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the most loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; they are the most steadfast, bravest, wisest, and most talented in the storms of class struggle. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the most thorough line of mass work. Chairman Mao has set three major styles for our party, one of which is to maintain close ties with the masses.

In recent years, although I have done some work for the party, I have also made some mistakes and caused some losses to the party. One of the main reasons I made mistakes is that I was poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the backwardness of the masses," always thinking that the masses are "backward" and that I am superior, placing myself in a position opposed to the masses. Through the practical education of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply feel that a person who joins the party and becomes a cadre is entirely the result of the party and the masses cultivating him. Joining the party and becoming a cadre does not mean that one is superior to ordinary laborers, but rather that one's responsibilities are greater, and the party and the masses have higher expectations of him. Only by always being loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and "going to the masses and coming from the masses," can one always maintain the character of a vanguard fighter of the proletariat and strive for the liberation of all mankind for life.

Whether to build a proletarian revolutionary party that is closely connected with the masses, or to cultivate a privileged class that stands above the masses, has always been an important aspect of the fierce struggle between the two classes and the two lines in the question of party building. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates the "theory of the backwardness of the masses" precisely because he wants to make Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres "peacefully evolve" into "officials" with moldy brains, degenerate into a privileged class that hates and suppresses the revolutionary masses, and thus change the nature of the party to create conditions for his restoration of capitalism. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian line of party building, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the backwardness of the masses," and closely rely on the broad revolutionary masses to do a good job of open-door rectification and party building, constantly renewing and invigorating the party organization, and building it into a vigorous vanguard organization of the proletariat.

    群众是历史的主人

    毛主席最近指出：“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”这是对马克思列宁主义建党学说的新发展，是党的建设的根本方向。
    中国赫鲁晓夫公然反对毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，拚命鼓吹“群众落后论”，胡说什么：“散漫性、保守性、狭隘性、落后性，对于财产的私有观念”，就是“农民阶级的特性”。在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，群众都是“阿斗”、“群氓”，只有他自己才是“救世主”、“诸葛亮”。呸！真不知天下还有羞耻二字！这是他一贯推行资产阶级反动路线的理论基础，是他资产阶级反动世界观的大暴露。
    毛主席教导我们说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”工人阶级、贫下中农最忠于毛主席，最忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的革命路线；他们在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，表现最坚定，最勇敢，最聪明，最有才能。毛主席的革命路线就是最彻底的群众路线。毛主席为我们党确定的三大作风，其中很重要的一条就是密切联系群众。
    几年来，我虽然为党作了一些工作，但也犯了一些错误，给党造成一些损失。我所以会犯错误，很重要的一条，就是受了中国赫鲁晓夫“群众落后论”的毒害，总认为群众“落后”，自己高明，把自己摆在和群众对立的地位上。经过文化大革命的实际教育，我深切地体会到，一个人入了党，当上了干部，完全是党和群众培养的结果。入了党，当了干部，绝不意味着自己比普通劳动者高了一等，而是意味着责任更重大，党和群众对自己的要求也更高了。自己只有永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，“从群众中来，到群众中去”，才能永远保持无产阶级先锋战士的本色，为全人类的解放事业奋斗终生。
    是建设一个密切联系群众的无产阶级革命党，还是培植一个高踞于群众之上的特权阶层，从来就是党的建设问题上两个阶级、两条路线激烈斗争的一个重要方面。中国赫鲁晓夫所以贩卖“群众落后论”，就是妄图使共产党员和革命干部“和平演变”为头脑修得发霉的“官老爷”，蜕变成为仇视和镇压革命群众的特权阶层，从而改变党的性质，为他复辟资本主义创造条件。我们一定要坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，彻底清除中国赫鲁晓夫“群众落后论”的余毒，紧紧地依靠广大革命人民群众，作好开门整党建党工作，不断地吐故纳新，把党组织建设成为永远朝气蓬勃的无产阶级先锋队组织。
