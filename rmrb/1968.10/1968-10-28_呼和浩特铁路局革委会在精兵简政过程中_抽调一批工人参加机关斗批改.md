The Revolutionary Committee of Hohhot Railway Bureau, in the process of streamlining and reducing personnel, has selected a group of workers to participate in the rectification of the office.

Many veteran workers use their own bitter family histories to educate the office cadres on class struggle, arousing everyone's class consciousness and effectively promoting the streamlining and reducing personnel work throughout the bureau.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, October 27th — During the implementation of streamlining and reducing personnel, the Revolutionary Committee of Hohhot Railway Bureau has, with leadership and planning, selected a group of workers who have long been on the front lines of the three great revolutionary movements to form a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. They have entered the bureau office to participate in the struggle, criticism, and rectification, promoting the streamlining and reducing personnel work throughout the bureau.

This propaganda team, mainly composed of veteran workers and including a few young workers and leaders from the grassroots revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations, has entered the bureau office and fought side by side with revolutionary cadres and staff. They have conducted in-depth investigations and research, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the bureau regarding the construction of political power, criticized various forms of conservatism and reformism, and firmly established Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Hohhot Railway Bureau was established in 1958. Over the past ten years, China's Khrushchev and his agents have, in order to turn Hohhot Railway Bureau into a base for their restoration of capitalism, frantically pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, recruited traitors, appointed relatives, and created positions for individuals. This has led to overlapping and cumbersome office structures, an increasing number of non-production personnel, and severe alienation from the masses. After the workers' propaganda team entered the bureau office, they conducted investigations and research in twenty-nine departments. An old worker investigated one department, which had only two people, a secretary-general and a secretary. Originally, they could work in the same office, but they insisted on separating the inner and outer rooms, each with a telephone. When grassroots comrades came to handle matters, they had to first find the secretary and then go to the inner room to find the secretary-general, wasting half a day and not solving the problem. The comrades from the workers' propaganda team said, "Such a structure can't help but produce revisionism!" Through extensive exposure, discussion, and criticism, the class struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary cadres and staff has been greatly heightened, and they are determined to break away from the old structure and resolutely take the path of streamlining and reducing personnel.

Streamlining and reducing personnel is a sharp and profound class struggle. The new revolutionary organization is in sharp contradiction with the old ideas and styles of the exploiting class. After the establishment of the bureau revolutionary committee, two proposals for streamlining and reducing personnel were made, but due to the incitement of class enemies with bourgeois factionalism, little progress was made. This time, as soon as the streamlining and reducing personnel work began, some people with conservative thoughts said, "The railway is a system; if the higher authorities don't move, we can't move." Others said, "Other departments can reduce, but my department can't." Therefore, when proposing reform plans, they couldn't break free from the old structure. A small number of class enemies jumped out again, spreading various rumors and trying to sabotage the streamlining and reducing personnel work. Facing this situation, the comrades from the workers' propaganda team went deep into various departments and, together with the broad revolutionary cadres and staff, studied and applied Chairman Mao's teachings on streamlining and reducing personnel. They criticized the conservative tendencies that appeared in the streamlining and reducing personnel work and severely criticized the agents of China's Khrushchev in the bureau, striking down the reactionary momentum of the class enemies. On the basis of further raising the class struggle awareness of the broad cadres and staff, in just a few days, everyone proposed forty-three streamlining plans. The bureau revolutionary committee concentrated the wisdom of the masses, repeatedly deliberated and revised, and determined a relatively complete plan. It was decided to change the original thirty-one departments and one hundred and eight sections into three groups: the administrative group, the political work group, and the production group. The number of non-production management personnel was reduced from the original eight hundred and forty-one to ninety-three, a reduction of eighty-nine percent.

During the process of streamlining and reducing personnel, many active thoughts were exposed among the office cadres, and the ideological struggle was intense. Some people passively waited, preparing to "struggle, criticize, and leave"; others were anxious and worried. The comrades from the workers' propaganda team and the broad revolutionary cadres studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" together, thoroughly criticized the bourgeois "self," and firmly established the proletarian "public." Many veteran workers used their own bitter family histories to educate the office cadres on class struggle, arousing everyone's class consciousness. Some comrades talked with veteran workers until late at night, moved to tears. Some comrades were resting at home due to illness, and the propaganda team comrades went to their homes to enthusiastically conduct political and ideological work. After the office cadres' consciousness was raised, they were determined to accept the workers' re-education.

Revolutionary cadres and staff, in summarizing the gains of this streamlining and reducing personnel work, deeply felt, "The office was streamlined in just twenty days, with such great effects and such thorough streamlining, it would not have been possible without the workers' participation." The office, after streamlining and reducing personnel, has a completely new look. Currently, the bureau revolutionary committee is summarizing and promoting the experience of streamlining and reducing personnel in the bureau office. Following Chairman Mao's great instruction to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and rectification," a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and rectification is being launched throughout the bureau.

    呼和浩特铁路局革委会在精兵简政过程中
    抽调一批工人参加机关斗批改
    许多老工人以自己的苦难家史对机关干部进行阶级教育，激发了大家的阶级觉悟，有力地推动了全局精兵简政工作的开展
    新华社呼和浩特二十七日电　呼和浩特铁路局革委会在实行精兵简政的过程中，有领导有计划地抽调一批长期战斗在三大革命运动第一线的工人组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，到局机关参加斗、批、改，推动了全局精兵简政工作的开展。
    这支以老工人为主体，包括少数青年工人和基层革委会及革命群众组织负责人的工人毛泽东思想宣传队进到局机关后，就和机关里的革命职工、革命干部并肩战斗，深入地进行调查研究，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本局的代理人在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线，批判了形形色色的保守主义、改良主义，大立了毛主席的革命路线。
    呼和浩特铁路局是一九五八年建立的。十年来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，为了把呼和浩特铁路局变为他们复辟资本主义的阵地，疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，招降纳叛，任人唯亲，因人设事，使局机关机构重叠庞杂，脱产人员越来越多，严重脱离群众。工人宣传队进到局机关后，深入到二十九个处室进行调查研究。一位老工人调查了一个室，这个室只有两个人，一个秘书长，一个秘书，本来一块办公就可以了，但偏要里外屋隔开，每人一部电话。基层的同志来办事，还得先找秘书，然后才能到里屋找秘书长，磨蹭半天，解决不了问题。工人宣传队的同志们说：“这样的机构还能不出修正主义！”通过大揭大议大批，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争觉悟，决心打破旧机构，坚决走精兵简政的道路。
    精兵简政是一场尖锐、深刻的阶级斗争。新的革命机构，同剥削阶级的旧观念、旧作风，存在着尖锐的矛盾。局革命委员会成立后，曾两次提出实行精兵简政，但由于一小撮阶级敌人煽起资产阶级派性，都没有取得多大进展。这次精兵简政一开始，一些有保守思想的人说：“铁路是一个系统，上边不动，我们不能动。”有的说：“别的部门可以减，我这个部门不能减。”因而在提改革方案时，跳不出旧机构的圈子。一小撮阶级敌人又跳出来散布种种流言蜚语，妄图破坏精兵简政工作。针对这种情况，工人宣传队的同志们，深入各处室，和广大革命职工一块活学活用毛主席有关精兵简政的教导，批判了在精兵简政中出现的保守主义倾向，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在本局的代理人，打击了阶级敌人的反动气焰。在广大职工的阶级斗争觉悟进一步提高的基础上，几天之内，大家就先后提出了四十三个精简方案。局革委会集中群众的智慧，经过反复酝酿修改，确定了一个比较完善的方案，决定将原来的三十一个部（委）、处室、一百零八个科室，改为三个组即办事组、政工组、生产组。脱产管理人员由原来的八百四十一人减少到九十三人，减少了百分之八十九。
    在精兵简政的过程中，机关干部中暴露了许多活思想，思想斗争十分激烈。有的消极等待，准备“斗批走”；有的患得患失。工人宣传队的同志和广大革命干部一同学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字。许多老工人以自己的苦难家史对机关干部进行阶级教育，激发大家的阶级觉悟，有的同志和老工人谈到深夜，激动得流下热泪。有的同志有病在家休养，宣传队的同志就上门热情地向他们进行政治思想工作。机关干部觉悟提高后，决心接受工人的再教育。
    革命职工在总结这次精兵简政的收获时深有体会地说：“机关这次精简只用了二十天工夫，效果这么大，精简这么彻底，没有工人参加是不可能的。”精兵简政后的机关，面目为之一新。目前，局革委会正在总结、推广局机关精兵简政的经验，遵照毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大教导，在全局范围内掀起斗、批、改新高潮。
