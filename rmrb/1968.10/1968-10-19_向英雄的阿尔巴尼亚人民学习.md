In the autumn of 1965, several Chinese technicians arrived in Albania. In this heroic country, we lived and worked with the diligent and brave Albanian people for over two years. The Albanian people's spirit of building socialism with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun, and their deep friendship towards the Chinese people, will forever be etched in our hearts. Scenes of fervent construction and warm faces still appear before our eyes, inspiring us.

We Chinese technicians were sent to Albania according to the Sino-Albanian economic and technological cooperation agreement to participate in the construction of the Vau i Dejes Hydroelectric Station. During the construction of the power station, we witnessed and experienced firsthand how the Albanian people, in international struggles, are a formidable vanguard against imperialism, modern revisionism, and in support of the world's revolutionary people. In domestic construction, they are also towering heroes.

The Vau i Dejes Hydroelectric Station project is immense, with high technical requirements. The Albanian people, relying mainly on their own strength, carried out the exploration and design work of the power station with a revolutionary spirit of hard struggle.

The primary task in building the Vau i Dejes Hydroelectric Station is to construct a massive dam on the Drin River to block the floodwaters. To build such a dam, one must first determine the thickness of the riverbed cover layer. Previously, imperialist countries had sent so-called "experts" to Vau i Dejes village to survey the Drin River. Their conclusion was that it was impossible to build a dam in Vau i Dejes. Later, the Soviet revisionists, aiming to control Albania, also sent "experts" to Vau i Dejes. A group of Soviet revisionist "experts" spent several months in Vau i Dejes village, shaking their heads and drilling a forty-meter-deep hole in the Drin River. The rock core they extracted was indistinguishable. Based on this useless hole, they claimed that the cover layer was seventy to eighty meters thick, and that Albania's economic conditions and technical capabilities were insufficient to build the dam. However, the Albanian people dared to think and act boldly. They used their own labor to completely refute the absurd conclusions of imperialism and revisionism. They are now successfully building the Vau i Dejes Hydroelectric Station on the Drin River with their own hands.

The most arduous task in building the Vau i Dejes Hydroelectric Station is the exploration of the riverbed cover layer drilling project. The drilling project began in the winter when it often rains in Albania. Therefore, the construction had to fight not only against the cold but also against the raging floods. The drilling project had to be carried out in the river's center. What to do? According to general experience, drilling in the river's center would require several boats, and the boats would need to be fixed in the river's center with iron cables before starting the work. However, the Drin River's floods were so fierce that there were no boats, and even if there were, they could not be anchored. The Albanian comrades came up with the idea of driving piles in the river and building a temporary bridge to place the drilling machine on for construction, solving the problem. The two sides of the Drin River's mouth are high mountains, making it a windy area. The Albanian comrades braved the strong winds and cold, often working on the bridge in heavy rain. One day, the wind howled, and the surging floodwaters hit the wooden piles supporting the temporary bridge, causing the bridge to sway. Suddenly, a flood wave swept over the bridge, washing away the middle section. The Albanian comrades, without hesitation, jumped into the icy floodwaters to rescue the situation. The temporary bridge was quickly repaired, and the comrades continued their work, laughing and chatting. Such moving examples of revolutionary heroism are countless.

During the exploration, design, and construction of the power station, the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and other central leaders often visited the construction site. The concern of the central leaders greatly inspired all the builders of the power station. Many leading cadres of the Party Central Committee and local authorities often worked alongside the workers, rolling up their sleeves and working bare-chested.

We also deeply felt that the Albanian people regard the Chinese people as their brothers and relatives. In Albania, whether it is the elderly with white hair or children who have just begun to understand the world, they are all so affectionate when they see Chinese comrades and always ask about Chairman Mao. There was a worker who loved Chairman Mao very much. During his vacation, he carefully drew a portrait of Chairman Mao and gave it to the Chinese comrades.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, said: "Within the seas, there are friends; across the sky, it is like being neighbors." Although we have returned to our country, we still often miss our Albanian brothers who once worked with us. We must learn from the revolutionary spirit and indomitable will of the Albanian people and forever stand together with the Albanian people in the struggle.

    向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民学习
    水电部北京勘测设计院　向红　朝阳
    一九六五年秋天，我们几个中国技术员到了阿尔巴尼亚。在这个英雄的国家里，我们同勤劳、勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚人民一起生活、工作了两年多。阿尔巴尼亚人民一手拿镐、一手拿枪建设社会主义的冲天干劲和对中国人民的深厚友谊永远铭记在我们心中。一幕幕沸腾的建设场面，一张张热情的面孔，还时时呈现在我们的眼前，激励着我们。
    我们几个中国技术员是根据中阿经济技术合作协定被派往阿尔巴尼亚参加伐乌—代耶水电站建设的。在水电站的兴建过程中，我们亲眼见到、亲身体会到，阿尔巴尼亚人民不仅在国际斗争中是一支反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和支持世界革命人民的坚强突击队，在国内建设方面，也是顶天立地的英雄。
    伐乌—代耶水电站的工程是巨大的，技术要求也很高。阿尔巴尼亚人民主要依靠自己的力量，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，完成了水电站工程的勘探、设计等工作。
    在德林河上筑一道拦洪的大坝是兴建伐乌—代耶水电站主要的工程。而要筑一道拦洪大坝首先要摸清河床覆盖层的厚度。过去帝国主义国家的技术“权威”曾经到过伐乌—代耶村，勘探过德林河的河床，他们的结论是：在伐乌—代耶根本不能修大坝。后来苏联修正主义为了控制阿尔巴尼亚，也派“专家”到过伐乌—代耶。一批苏修“专家”在伐乌—代耶村摇头晃脑好几个月，在德林河上钻了一个四十米深的孔，取出的岩芯分辨不出是什么东西。他们就根据这么一个废孔，说那里的覆盖层厚达七、八十米，阿尔巴尼亚的经济条件和技术能力修不了这个坝。但是阿尔巴尼亚人民敢想敢干，他们用自己劳动的成果完全推翻了帝国主义和修正主义的荒谬透顶的结论，他们依靠自己的双手正在德林河上顺利地建设伐乌—代耶水电站。
    兴建伐乌—代耶水电站最艰苦的工作要算勘探河床覆盖层的钻采工程。钻采工程是在阿尔巴尼亚经常下雨的冬季开始的。因此施工不仅要和严寒作斗争，而且要和凶猛的洪水作斗争。钻采工程必须在河中心进行。怎么办？按照一般的经验，在河中心钻采一定得有几条船，并且要用铁缆把船固定在河中心，然后正式施工。但是德林河上洪水汹涌，根本没有船，有船也停不住。阿尔巴尼亚同志想出了在河中打桩的办法，架起了一道便桥，把钻机放在桥上施工，解决了这个问题。德林河河口两侧是高山，因此又是风口。阿尔巴尼亚同志冒着大风严寒，经常在大雨中坚持在桥上工作。有一天，大风呼啸着，汹涌的洪水拍打着支撑便桥的木桩，桥面晃晃荡荡，突然一个洪峰没桥而过，把桥的中段冲走了。阿尔巴尼亚同志一个个毫不犹豫地跳入刺骨的洪水中抢救。便桥很快修复了，同志们又说说笑笑继续工作了。这样动人的革命英雄主义事例，我们亲眼见到听到的是说不完的。
    在水电站的勘探、设计、施工过程中，阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志以及其他中央领导同志经常到工地视察。中央领导同志的关怀，给水电站全体建设者以极大的鼓舞。劳动党中央和地方的许多领导干部，经常以普通劳动者的身份，挽起裤腿，光着膀子和工人一起劳动。
    我们还深深感到，阿尔巴尼亚人民把中国人民当成自己的兄弟和亲人。在阿尔巴尼亚不管是白发苍苍的老人，还是刚刚懂事的娃娃，他们一见到中国同志都是那么亲热，都要问毛主席好。有一个工人，他非常热爱毛主席，利用休假时间。精细地画了一幅毛主席像送给中国同志。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”我们虽然回国了，但是仍时时怀念着曾经一起工作过的阿尔巴尼亚兄弟们。我们要学习阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命精神和冲天干劲，永远同阿尔巴尼亚人民战斗在一起。
