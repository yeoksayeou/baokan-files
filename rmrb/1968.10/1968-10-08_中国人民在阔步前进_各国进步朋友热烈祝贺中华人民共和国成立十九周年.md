	According to a summary from Xinhua News Agency:

	The Pathet Lao radio station in Laos issued a commentary on October 1, enthusiastically celebrating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The commentary said that the creativity of Chinese workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, has brought China into a new era.

	The commentary said that since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has persistently opposed imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States. It is a strong backbone of the national liberation movement worldwide.

	On September 30, about 700 people from various circles in Ceylon held a grand meeting in Colombo to enthusiastically celebrate the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The meeting was initiated by the Ceylon-China Friendship Association and presided over by its chairman, Walpita.

	The meeting passed a resolution enthusiastically congratulating the great victory of China's Cultural Revolution.

	On September 30, the Somali Coastal Liberation Front sent a letter to the Chinese Embassy in Somalia, enthusiastically congratulating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The letter said: Since liberation, the Chinese people, under the guidance of the invincible principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have enthusiastically begun socialist construction in their own country with boundless enthusiasm. They fearlessly overcame all kinds of difficulties. After 19 years of struggle, the Chinese people, relying on their own efforts, have achieved brilliant victories in all aspects, thereby greatly shaking the foundations of the imperialist world, filling the hearts of all revolutionary peoples worldwide with joy and hope.

	On October 1, three newspapers in Afghanistan—*Reform*, *Friendship*, and *Kabul Times*—all prominently featured a photograph of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, on their front pages. The three newspapers all published editorials celebrating China's National Day, praising the Chinese people for overcoming many difficulties and marching forward on the path of national construction.

	In a telegram, the acting chairman and national secretary of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, B. Leballo, said: "The Pan-Africanist Congress represents the 18 million people of Azania in paying tribute to the 700 million heroic Chinese people." The telegram enthusiastically congratulated the Chinese people on their great victory in establishing revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, except Taiwan, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao.

	In a telegram, the chief representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union in East Africa, Chihuta, hailed the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao in a short period. The telegram said: "These achievements and the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are outstanding and precious contributions to the struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world. These achievements and victories further prove the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought."
