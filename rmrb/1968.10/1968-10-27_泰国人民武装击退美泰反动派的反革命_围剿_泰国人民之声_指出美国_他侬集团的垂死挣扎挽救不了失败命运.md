In recent days, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people’s armed forces have bravely and intelligently repelled the counterrevolutionary “encirclement and suppression” launched by the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique and have taken the initiative to launch attacks, achieving new victories and dealing a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thai reactionaries.

According to a broadcast by the “Voice of the Thai People” radio station, from October 6 to 12, the people’s armed forces in Bang County, Chiang Rai Province, in northern Thailand, bravely repelled the enemy’s counterrevolutionary “encirclement and suppression” three times. Earlier, on September 11, the Bang County people’s armed forces cleverly surrounded and intercepted a batch of reactionary military and police led by the fake county chief of Bang County, smashing their “encirclement and suppression” and routing the enemy. In early September, the people’s armed forces in Nakhon Phanom Province also shot down an enemy helicopter, annihilating all the enemy on board.

The radio station said that in the south, the people’s armed forces in Pattani Province, with the support and cooperation of the masses, recently also killed and wounded several enemy troops who had come to attack.

The radio station also said that in the central region, the people in Khon Kaen, Maha Sarakham, and Yasothon Provinces have also launched armed struggles. Recently, the people’s armed forces in Khon Kaen Province attacked an enemy stronghold.

According to reports in Thai newspapers, since early October, the people’s armed forces in Nakhon Phanom Province have not only bravely repelled the enemy’s multiple counterrevolutionary “encirclement and suppression” attacks but have also seized the opportunity to launch attacks on enemy strongholds.

According to a revelation by the police chief and deputy police commissioner of the Thanom traitorous clique on the 21st, anti-Thanom clique leaflets have recently been found in the center of U.S.-Thai reactionary rule, Bangkok, causing the U.S.-Thai reactionary clique to panic.

The “Voice of the Thai People” radio station broadcast an article on the 19th pointing out that the desperate struggles of the U.S.-Thanom clique cannot save their doomed fate.

The article said that the revolutionary armed struggle of the Thai people led by the Communist Party of Thailand is rapidly developing and growing, dealing a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique. However, as the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: “Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles. ‘Disrupt, fail, disrupt again, fail again, until they perish’—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people’s cause. They will not deviate from this logic. This is a law of Marxism.” The U.S.-Thanom clique is precisely following this logic towards its doom.

The article exposed that currently, the U.S.-Thanom clique is intensifying its suppression of the people’s armed forces. At the beginning of this year, they mobilized fifteen battalions to suppress the people’s armed forces in the northeast, but suffered a shameful defeat. Recently, they have plotted to launch another mad suppression of the people’s armed forces in the northeast.

The article pointed out that the rapid development and growth of the Thai people’s revolutionary armed struggle have made U.S. imperialism extremely panicked. Recently, the U.S. ambassador to Thailand, Unger, has been running around frantically, engaging in conspiracies. Last month, he went to the northeast province of Loei, and this month, he went to the southern province of Surat Thani to engage in clandestine activities. The article said that currently, more and more U.S. troops are openly participating in the suppression of the Thai people’s armed forces. In many places in the southern provinces, there are U.S. “special warfare units” stationed to help the Thanom clique suppress the people.

The article said that the patriotic forces of Thailand are unstoppable by any force. The desperate struggles of the U.S.-Thai reactionaries can only fuel the flames of the people’s armed struggle, thereby accelerating the doom of the U.S.-Thai reactionaries.

    泰国人民武装击退美泰反动派的反革命“围剿”
    “泰国人民之声”指出美国—他侬集团的垂死挣扎挽救不了失败命运
    新华社二十五日讯　在泰国共产党领导下泰国人民武装最近英勇机智地击退了美国—他侬反动集团发动的反革命“围剿”，并且主动出击，取得了新胜利，给美泰反动派以沉重的打击。
    据“泰国人民之声”电台广播，十月六日到十二日，泰国北部清莱府磅县人民武装，先后三次英勇击退了敌人的反革命“围剿”。在这以前，九月十一日，磅县人民武装巧妙地包围截击由磅县伪县长率领的一批反动军警，粉碎了他们的“围剿”，把敌人打得狼狈不堪。九月初，难府人民武装又击落了敌人直升飞机一架，全歼机上的敌人。
    电台说，南部博他仑府人民武装在人民群众支持配合下，最近也打死打伤前来进犯的敌人数名。
    电台还说，中部佛丕府考锐、万叻、营扬等县人民也展开了武装斗争。最近人民武装在考锐县袭击了敌人的据点。
    据泰国报纸报道，难府人民武装十月初以来，不仅英勇地击退敌人发动的多次反革命“围剿”，还掌握时机，主动袭击敌人的据点。
    据他侬卖国集团的警察头目、副警察总监二十一日透露，在美泰反动统治的中心曼谷最近发现反对他侬集团的传单，美泰反动集团吓得惊惶失措。
    新华社讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十九日广播一篇文章指出，美国—他侬集团的垂死挣扎挽救不了它们的失败命运。
    文章说，泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民革命武装斗争正在迅速发展壮大，沉重地打击着美国—他侬集团的反动统治。但是，正如伟大领袖毛泽东主席所指出的：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。”美国—他侬集团正是按照这个逻辑走向灭亡。
    文章揭露，目前，美国—他侬集团正在加紧镇压人民武装。今年初，他们出动十五个营的兵力去镇压东北部人民武装，但是遭到了可耻的失败。近来，他们又策划再次疯狂镇压东北部人民武装的罪恶活动。
    文章指出，泰国人民革命武装斗争的迅速发展壮大，使美帝国主义十分恐慌。最近，美国驻泰国大使昂格尔东奔西走，四出活动。上个月他跑到东北部黎府，这个月初又跑到南部素叻府，进行阴谋勾当。文章说，目前，美国侵略军越来越多地公开参加镇压泰国人民武装，南部各府的好多地方，已有美国的“特种战斗部队”驻扎，用来帮助他侬集团镇压南部人民。
    文章说，泰国爱国力量是任何力量也不能阻挡的。美泰反动派的疯狂挣扎，只能促使人民武装斗争的烈火越烧越旺，从而加速美泰反动派走向灭亡。
