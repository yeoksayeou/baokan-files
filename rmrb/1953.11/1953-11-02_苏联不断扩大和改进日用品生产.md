The production of other daily industrial products such as cloth, shoes, paper, and food has also greatly increased. While increasing the quantity of products, various light industry and daily necessities industry departments have paid special attention to continuously improving product quality, mobilizing the vast number of factory workers to participate in the competition for producing high-quality products. Light industry and daily necessities industry factories have expanded the variety of products. This year, the styles of various leather shoes in the Soviet Union have increased twelvefold compared to 1940. The newly produced leather shoe styles are novel and durable. The styles of women's shoes have increased particularly, and in addition to leather, there are also silk and felt.

At the Moscow Shebakov Silk Weaving Factory, nearly 200 female workers, after graduating from the factory's "High-Quality Product Training Class," increased the production of first-class products from 78 percent to 94 percent. More than half of the high-quality product production teams at the Obukhov Textile Factory produce 100 percent first-class products.

The vast majority of workers at the Kirov Textile Factory now produce high-quality products.

    苏联不断扩大和改进日用品生产
   【新华社莫斯科一日电】苏联轻工业和日用品工业正不断增加产品数量、改进质量和扩大种类，以满足苏联人民日益增长的需要。
    今年苏联的轻工业和日用品工业产品的数量已大大增加。以毛丝织品为例，今年苏联毛织品产量比一九五○年增加百分之三十，丝织品的产量到明年将比一九五○年增加三倍。其他如布匹、鞋类、纸张、食品等日用工业的产量都大大提高。与增加产品数量的同时，各轻工业和日用品工业部门都特别注意不断改进产品的质量，发动工厂广大职工参加生产优等产品的竞赛。轻工业和日用品工业的工厂纷纷扩大了产品的种类。今年苏联各类皮鞋的样式比一九四○年增加了十二倍，新出产的皮鞋样式都很新颖，而且经久耐用。女鞋的样式增加得特别多，除皮革制的以外，还有丝制和毛毡制的。在纺织品方面，各种色泽鲜明、纤维细致的丝麻织品也增加得特别多。已有二千种新的花色的纺织品设计出来，将从明年起开始生产。此外，药品、食品和家具的种类也大为增加了。例如，列宁格勒化学制药厂今年就制造了一百二十多种新的药品。
    苏联各企业工人在改进产品质量的竞赛中已获得了显著的成就。莫斯科谢巴科夫丝织厂有将近两百名女工在该厂“优等产品训练班”毕业后，生产的头等产品从百分之七十八提高到百分之九十四。奥布霍夫纺织厂有一半以上的优等产品生产组出产着百分之百的头等产品。伊凡诺佛的“红色伏尔加”纺织联合工厂副领班斯楚基赫发起生产优等产品的竞赛，在该州各纺织厂中得到了热烈的响应。基洛夫纺织厂现在有绝大多数的工人都出产优等产品。
