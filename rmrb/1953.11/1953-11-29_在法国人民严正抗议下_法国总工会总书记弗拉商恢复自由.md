    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 28th: Amidst the strong protests of the French people, the Investigation Chamber of the Paris Court of Appeal decided on the 26th to temporarily release Benoît Frachon, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor.
    Frachon was arrested on the 22nd by the government authorities on the false charge of "endangering the external security of the state." As soon as the news of Frachon's arrest spread, a movement to protest the illegal arrest of Frachon immediately unfolded in France. Workers, under the call of the French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor, held short protest strikes and rallies. The National Federation of Food Industry Workers, the National Federation of Miners, and other trade union organizations sent delegations to petition the court and the Prime Minister's Office. Many well-known figures in the scientific, cultural, and religious circles also demanded the release of Frachon.

    在法国人民严正抗议下
    法国总工会总书记弗拉商恢复自由
    【新华社二十八日讯】巴黎消息：在法国人民严正的抗议声中，巴黎上诉法院侦察庭在二十六日决定暂时释放法国总工会总书记贝诺瓦·弗拉商。
    弗拉商被政府当局诬告“危害国家外部安全”罪，在二十二日被捕。弗拉商被捕的消息一传出，法国国内就立刻展开了抗议非法逮捕弗拉商的运动。工人们在法国共产党和总工会的号召下举行了短时间的抗议罢工和集会。全国食品工业工人联合会、全国矿工联合会及其他工会组织都派出代表团向法院及总理办公厅请愿。许多科学、文化和宗教界知名人士都要求释放弗拉商。
