Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 1st: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued the following communique on October 31st:

Regardless of the repeated protests from the Korean-Chinese side and the condemnation of the people of the world, the US side and its special agents continue to obstruct the prisoners of war from listening to explanations with inhuman atrocities, and threaten the prisoners of war not to apply for repatriation, so that the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side has never been able to proceed normally. From October 19th to 30th, it was interrupted for as long as eleven consecutive days. The US side also used this interruption of the explanation work to direct a large number of special agents mixed into the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp to actively arrange and deploy illegal activities to further sabotage the explanation and obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war.

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on October 31st, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, lodged a serious protest to the US side on this matter, and once again seriously warned the US side: If the US side continues to sabotage the explanation work, obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war, and undermine the implementation of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's scope of authority, it will inevitably lead to the most serious consequences, and the US side must bear full responsibility for it.

The full text of Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho's speech is as follows:

Ignoring our repeated solemn protests and the condemnation of the people of the world, your side continues to arbitrarily sabotage the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stipulated in the Armistice Agreement, and obstruct and sabotage the explanation and visitation work in every possible way. Your side has delayed the construction of explanation facilities, delayed the start of explanation work; your side has illegally dispatched Chiang Kai-shek special agents who have been entrenched in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp to oppress our captured personnel, acting as so-called representatives of your side to attend the explanation and visitation, disrupting the order and rules of the explanation site, and openly threatening prisoners of war to prevent them from applying for repatriation; your side has illegally arranged special agents among our captured personnel to obstruct prisoners of war from listening to explanations with inhuman atrocities, and threaten them with despicable and shameless rumors and distortions, so that they dare not apply for repatriation; when your side's various sabotage and obstruction cannot fully guarantee your despicable purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, your side directly instigates the special agents mixed into the prisoners of war to simply forbid the prisoners of war from attending explanations and visitations. As a result, the explanation and visitation work has not only failed to proceed normally, but also fell into a long period of interruption after only two days of starting. Since the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over all prisoners of war, the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side has only been conducted twice, with a total of only seven and a half hours of actual explanation time, which is less than the explanation time that should be available within one day according to regulations. During the interruption of the explanation work, your side intensified its reign of terror, actively arranged and deployed illegal activities to further sabotage the explanation work. I lodge a strong protest to you against this series of serious acts of sabotage of the Armistice Agreement.

The scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stipulated in the Armistice Agreement clearly states that the control of prisoners of war by the original detaining party must be completely lifted. However, your side blatantly maintains control over the prisoners of war through special agent organizations, obstructing or even forbidding the prisoners of war from attending explanations and visitations, and using the interruption of the explanation work to arrange further illegal activities to sabotage the explanation work. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stated as early as in its statement on October 2, 1953, that "The prisoners of war were undoubtedly grouped and organized during the reception work, and this form of organization is still retained in the current prisoner-of-war camp. All the leaders among the prisoners of war before being received by the Indian troops continue to exert influence on the prisoners of war. The prisoners of war are subjected to great pressure, and sometimes this pressure is violent." Your news reports also openly acknowledge these facts. An Associated Press report on October 20, 1953, stated: "North Korean prisoners of war have a strong organization, but a single word from the American troops in Korea is enough to make them come out to listen to the Communists' explanations." The fact that prisoners of war repatriated to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission during the interruption of the explanation work, breaking through the control of your special agents, not only completely exposes your lies that "prisoners of war are unwilling to listen to explanations," but also further exposes the fact that your special agents are actively arranging illegal activities to further sabotage the explanation work. Wen Chonghao, the head of the Lee Seung-man special agents mixed in with the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, openly issued instructions to use the time when the explanation work was suspended to expand special agent organizations such as the "Garrison," intensify the manufacturing of weapons, and imprison and kill so-called "unreliable elements" who firmly demanded repatriation, so that after all arrangements are properly made, prisoners of war may be allowed to attend explanation and visitation work when necessary, continue to carry out sabotage and obstruction, so that prisoners of war still dare not exercise their right to repatriation. The scope of authority clearly stipulates that neither side shall interfere with or influence the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in performing its tasks and work in any name or in any way. However, your Lee Seung-man clique openly threatens the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial forces with force not to exercise the powers conferred upon them by the scope of authority to take necessary measures to ensure that prisoners of war can attend explanations and visitations and apply for repatriation without interference or threat. The scope of authority clearly stipulates that the explanation work should begin immediately after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over all prisoners of war, and there should be a period of ninety days. However, your side obstructs the timely start of the explanation work and sabotages the normal progress of the explanation work on the one hand; on the other hand, your side opposes the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's decision to extend the explanation period, attempting to deprive the ninety-day explanation time rights granted to the prisoners of war's belonging party by the scope of authority, as well as the prisoners of war's right to listen to explanations for ninety days. It must be pointed out that since the explanation work has not been able to start on schedule and proceed normally without interruption due to your side's direct obstruction and the sabotage of the special agents arranged by your side, the explanation period must be extended according to the actual time of the explanation work, until the prisoners of war's belonging party completes the explanation work for eight hours a day for a total of ninety days.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers once again issue a serious warning to your side: The solemn agreement on the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is a major part of the Armistice Agreement, and your side is not allowed to arbitrarily sabotage it. If your side continues to sabotage the explanation work, obstruct prisoners of war from applying for repatriation, and make the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission impossible to implement, it will inevitably lead to the most serious consequences, and your side must bear full responsibility for it.

    在朝鲜军事停战委员会十月三十一日会议上
    我方严重抗议美方破坏解释工作
    再次警告美方不得继续进行破坏否则应对后果负完全责任
    【新华社开城一日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团十月三十一日发表公报如下：
    美方及其特务不顾朝中方面的一再抗议与全世界人民的谴责，仍然继续以惨无人道的暴行来阻挠战俘听取解释，并威胁战俘不得申请遣返，使朝中方面的解释工作始终无法正常进行。自十月十九日至三十日并曾连续中断达十一天之久，而美方又利用这一解释工作中断的时间，指挥其混入东场里战俘营的大批特务积极安排与布置进一步破坏解释、阻挠战俘遣返的非法活动。
    在十月三十一日军事停战委员会上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将已就此向美方提出严重抗议，并再一次严重警告美方：如美方仍继续破坏解释工作、阻挠战俘遣返、破坏中立国遣返委员会职权范围的实施，则将必然引起最严重的后果，其完全责任必须由美方完全负担。
    李相朝中将的发言全文如下：
    你方不顾我方一再的严正抗议和全世界人民的谴责，继续不断地恣意破坏停战协定中立国遣返委员会的职权范围，百般阻挠和破坏解释与访问工作。你方拖延解释设备的修建，延迟了解释工作的开始；你方非法派遣长期盘踞在济州岛战俘营欺压我方被俘人员的蒋介石特务，充当所谓你方代表出席解释与访问，破坏解释场所的秩序与规则，公然威胁战俘阻止他们申请遣返；你方非法布置在我方被俘人员中的特务分子以惨无人道的暴行阻挠战俘听取解释，以卑鄙无耻的造谣和歪曲威胁他们，使他们不敢申请遣返；在你方这种种破坏与阻挠还不能完全保证你方强迫扣留战俘的卑鄙目的的时候，你方更直接指使混入战俘中的特务分子，根本不准战俘出席解释与访问，解释与访问工作因而不但始终未能正常进行，而且开始两天即陷于长期的中断。自中立国遣返委员会接管全部战俘时起，朝中方面的解释工作仅能进行了两次，总共只有七小时半的实际解释时间，不足一天内根据规定所应有的解释时间。在解释工作中断期间，你方更指挥特务变本加厉地实行恐怖统治，积极安排和布置进一步破坏解释工作的非法活动，对于这一系列严重破坏停战协定的行为，我向你提出强硬抗议。
    停战协定中立国遣返委员会的职权范围明确规定：原拘留一方对于战俘的控制，必须全部予以解除。但你方明目张胆地通过特务组织，保持对战俘的控制，阻挠乃至不准战俘出席解释与访问，并利用解释工作的中断布置进一步地破坏解释工作。中立国遣返委员会早在一九五三年十月二日的声明中即已提出：“战俘在接收工作进行时无疑已分组组织好了，这种组织形式在现在的战俘营中仍旧保留着。在被印度部队接收以前战俘中间所有的领导分子现在仍继续对战俘行施影响。战俘遭受着很大的压力，有时这种压力是暴力行为。”你方新闻报道对于这些事实也公开予以承认。一九五三年十月二十日美联社报道：“北朝鲜战俘有着强有力的组织，但只要有在朝鲜的美国军队的一句话，就足以使他们出来听取共产党的解释。”在解释工作中断期间突破你方特务控制由中立国遣返委员会遣返我方的被俘人员，不但完全揭穿了你方所谓“战俘不愿听取解释”的鬼话，而且进一步地揭露了你方特务积极布置进一步破坏解释工作的非法活动的事实。混在朝鲜人民军被俘人员中的李承晚特务头子文重浩，公然发出指令，利用解释工作停顿的时间扩大“警备队”等特务组织，加紧制造武器，囚禁与杀害坚决要求遣返的所谓“不可靠分子”，以便在一切安排妥当后，必要时可以允许战俘出席解释与访问工作，继续进行破坏与阻挠，使战俘仍然不敢行使其遣返的权利。职权范围明确规定：双方不得以任何名义和任何方式干涉或影响中立国遣返委员会执行其任务与工作。但你方李承晚集团公开以武力威胁中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不得行使职权范围所赋予的权力采取必要措施，保证战俘确实不受干扰与威胁地出席解释与访问和申请遣返。职权范围明确规定：解释工作应在中立国遣返委员会接管全部战俘后即行开始，并应有九十天的期限。但你方一方面阻挠解释工作之按期开始，破坏解释工作之正常进行；另一方面又反对中立国遣返委员会关于顺延解释期限的决定，企图剥夺职权范围所赋予战俘所属一方的九十天解释时间的权利，以及战俘的九十天听取解释的权利。必须指出：解释工作既已由于你方的直接阻挠与你方所布置的特务的破坏而未能依照职权范围的规定按期开始并不中断地正常进行，解释期限就必须按照解释工作实际进行时间予以顺延，直至战俘所属一方完成每天八小时一共九十天的解释工作为止。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军再一次向你方提出严重的警告：中立国遣返委员会的职权范围的庄严协议，是停战协定的一个主要部分，决不容许你方恣意加以破坏。如果你方继续破坏解释工作，阻挠战俘申请遣返，使中立国遣返委员会的职权范围无从实施，则必然将引起最严重的后果，而你方必须担负其完全责任。
