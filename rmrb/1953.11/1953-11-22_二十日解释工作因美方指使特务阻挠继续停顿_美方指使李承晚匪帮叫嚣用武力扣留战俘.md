Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 21st: The explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side was still not restored on the 20th due to the deliberate obstruction and sabotage by special agents directed by the U.S. side. This is the fourth day since the fifth interruption of the explanation work on the 17th.

At the same time, the Rhee Syngman gang issued new howls from Seoul. According to International News Service, the Foreign Minister of the Rhee Syngman puppet government, Byun Yong-tae, openly threatened neutral nations in the pseudo "National Assembly" on the 19th, saying that if the Indian Custodial Forces fulfilled their duties and allowed all prisoners of war to listen to the explanations, South Korea would "use force." "If necessary," it would also "release" the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war by force.

The Rhee Syngman gang's issuance of such intimidating howls is obviously due to the instructions of the U.S. side. Its purpose is to put pressure on neutral nations, to force them to abandon their honor and submit to the will of the United States, and not to guarantee the progress of the explanation work in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," so that the United States can realize its conspiracy to forcibly detain Korean-Chinese prisoners of war.

Now, how to break the current deadlock and enable the explanation work to proceed normally is a serious issue of concern to the people of the world.

In the thirty-seven days since the explanation work began, the Korean-Chinese side has made continuous efforts to complete the explanation work stipulated in the "Terms of Reference," but each time it has been sabotaged by special agents directed by the U.S. side under various pretexts. Here are some memorable facts:

October 17th: The Korean-Chinese side's original plan for explanation work still required explanations to be given to the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in Camp No. 48. However, because the Rhee gang's special agents continued to prevent prisoners of war from leaving the camp, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission brought captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Camp No. 33 to the explanation site on this day. In order to take care of the difficulties of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces, the Korean-Chinese side temporarily agreed to explain to the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, so that the explanation work could be restored on this day.

During the second interruption of the explanation work (October 19th to 30th), the Korean-Chinese side successively proposed seven camps holding captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, expressing its willingness to explain to prisoners of war in any one of these camps. However, because the Rhee gang's special agents in all these camps were ordered to obstruct, the explanation was interrupted for another twelve days.

The third interruption of the explanation work occurred on November 2nd because: the Rhee-Chiang special agents in the camp threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that if broadcasts were conducted, they would launch riots. In order to avoid the continued stagnation of the explanation, the Korean-Chinese side, at the request of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, temporarily did not broadcast to the entire camp, but instead conducted collective explanations to about 500 prisoners of war waiting for individual explanations one hour before the individual explanations on that day, so that the explanation work could be restored on November 3rd.

Later, the U.S. side directed special agents to adopt new tactics of sabotage. On November 4th, the Korean-Chinese side only gave explanations to some prisoners of war in Camp No. 28. On the 5th, the special agents in this camp prevented the prisoners of war who had not yet heard the explanations from coming out again. In order to take care of the Indian Custodial Forces' difficulty in identifying the above-mentioned prisoners of war, the Korean-Chinese side changed to giving explanations to Camp No. 22 on the 5th. Because the Chiang gang's special agents in Camp No. 22 adopted the same methods and prevented any prisoners of war (regardless of whether they had heard the explanations or not) from coming out, the explanation work was forced to be interrupted for the fourth time from the 6th.

In order to take care of the difficulty of the Indian Custodial Forces in bringing out the un-explained prisoners of war who had been mixed together, the Korean-Chinese side has since the 10th no longer required only the un-explained prisoners of war in Camp No. 22 to be explained, but agreed to the request made by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 6th, that is, not to start explaining to a new camp until the explanations to all the prisoners of war in the entire camp were completed. When making this request, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission told the Korean-Chinese side that under this condition, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was prepared to build a camp to isolate those prisoners of war who had been explained and those who had not been explained.

In order to quickly restore the explanation work, the Korean-Chinese side has made new efforts, preparing to complete the plan of explaining to 500 people a day. It also agreed to temporarily not explain to Camp No. 22 but to the prisoners of war in Camp No. 53, so the explanation work, which had been interrupted for eight days, was restored on the 16th.

However, the Korean-Chinese side's plan to explain to 500 prisoners of war failed to be completed due to continued interference and obstruction from the U.S. side and special agents. According to the notification of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the U.S. special agents continued to oppose the isolation of prisoners of war who had heard the explanations and those who had not heard the explanations, because the special agents believed that this was an indirect method of disrupting the special agent organizations. The explanation work was forced to be interrupted for the fifth time and was on the verge of the current critical situation.

The course of the explanation work since its beginning shows that despite repeated efforts by the Korean-Chinese side, the explanation work cannot proceed normally if the control of the U.S. special agents existing in the custodial camps is not broken. If the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces do not perform their duties and powers in accordance with the "Terms of Reference," the special agents will continue to follow the plan predetermined by the U.S. side, causing the explanation work to be interrupted and completely destroyed.

### 二十日解释工作因美方指使特务阻挠继续停顿  美方指使李承晚匪帮叫嚣用武力扣留战俘

    二十日解释工作因美方指使特务阻挠继续停顿
    美方指使李承晚匪帮叫嚣用武力扣留战俘
    【新华社开城二十一日电】二十日，朝中方面的解释工作在美方指使特务蓄意阻挠和破坏下仍未恢复。这是解释工作自十七日第五次中断以来的第四天。
    同时，李承晚匪帮又从汉城发出新的叫嚣。据国际新闻社消息，李承晚傀儡政府的外务部长官卞荣泰十九日在伪“国民议会”上公然威胁中立国，如果印度看管部队履行职责使战俘都能去听取解释，南朝鲜就要“使用武力”。“如果必要的话”，还要“用武力释放”朝中战俘。
    李承晚匪帮发出这种恫吓叫嚣显然是出于美方的指示。其目的在于向中立国施加压力，要使中立国放弃它的荣誉而屈从美国的意旨，不按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”及“解释和访问工作细则”的规定来保证解释工作的进行，以便美国实现强迫扣留朝中战俘的阴谋。
    现在，如何打破目前的僵局，使解释工作能够正常进行，是世界人民当前所关心的严重问题。
    解释工作开始三十七天以来，朝中方面为完成“职权范围”所规定的解释工作，曾不断作了努力，但每次都被美方指使的特务以种种藉口所破坏。下面就是一些记忆犹新的事实：
    十月十七日，朝中方面原定解释工作计划仍要求向第四十八号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释。但是，由于李匪特务继续阻止战俘出营场，中立国遣返委员会这天把第三十三号营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员带到了解释场所。朝中方面为照顾中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队的困难，临时同意向中国人民志愿军被俘人员解释，使解释工作得以在这天恢复。
    在解释工作的第二次中断期间（十月十九日到三十日），朝中方面先后提出过七个看管朝鲜人民军被俘人员的营场，表示愿对其中任何一个营场的战俘进行解释。可是，由于所有这些营场中的李匪特务都奉命阻挠，又使解释中断了十二天。
    第三次解释工作的中断发生在十一月二日，原因是：营场中的李蒋特务威胁中立国遣返委员会说，如果进行广播就要发动骚乱。朝中方面为了避免解释的继续停顿，应中立国遣返委员会的请求，暂时不对全营地广播，改在当天个别解释前一小时向约五百名等待个别解释的战俘进行广播集体解释，使解释工作才能在十一月三日恢复。
    后来，美方指挥特务又采取了新的破坏策略。十一月四日，朝中方面只对第二十八号营场的部分战俘进行了解释，五日，这个营场中的特务就阻止尚未听解释的战俘再出来。朝中方面为照顾印度看管部队识别上述战俘的困难，又在五日改向第二十二号营场进行解释。由于第二十二号营场的蒋匪特务采取了同样的手段，并阻止任何战俘（不论其是否听过解释）出来，解释工作自六日起第四次被迫中断。
    为了照顾印度看管部队带出已经混合起来了的未经解释的战俘的困难，朝中方面自十日起即不再要求仅对第二十二号营场的未经解释的战俘进行解释，而同意了中立国遣返委员会六日提出的要求，即对整个营场的全部战俘解释完毕以前，不开始对新的营场的解释。中立国遣返委员会在提出这个要求的时候曾告诉朝中方面：在这个条件之下，中立国遣返委员会准备修建一个营场，以隔离那些已经解释和未经解释的战俘。
    为了使解释工作迅速恢复，朝中方面又作了新的努力，准备完成一天解释完五百人的计划。并同意暂时不向第二十二号营场而向第五十三号营场战俘进行解释，于是中断了八天的解释工作才于十六日恢复。
    但是，朝中方面对五百名战俘解释的计划由于继续遭到美方和特务的干扰和阻挠，而未能完成。据中立国遣返委员会通知，美方特务继续反对隔离已听过解释和未经解释的战俘，因为特务认为这是打乱特务组织的间接方法。解释工作又第五次被迫中断，而濒于目前危急的境地。
    解释工作开始以来的历程表明，尽管有朝中方面一再的努力，但如果存在于看管营地中的美方特务控制不被打破，解释工作是不可能正常进行的。如果中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不根据“职权范围”执行其职责与权力，特务必将继续按照美方预定的计划，使解释工作陷于中断并完全被破坏。
