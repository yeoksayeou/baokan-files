Our Great Motherland
After the autumn harvest, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions hold small-scale harvest exhibitions to compare agricultural products, greatly increasing farmers' enthusiasm for production. This is the harvest exhibition held by the Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang. Farmers from both inside and outside the cooperative come here to visit.
