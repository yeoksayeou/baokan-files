Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 26th: The Indian Custodial Forces announced on the 25th that seven Chiang Kai-shek special agents who murdered Zhang Zilong, a captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, will be tried by the military court of the Indian Custodial Forces on December 11th. According to the notification from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to the Korean-Chinese side, the indictment against these special agents states that these seven special agents "are charged with a civil crime, namely, the crime of murder. On or around October 3, 1953, in the 28th camp area of ​​Camp D, they fatally wounded Zhang Zilong, a prisoner of war in the same camp, thereby committing the crime of murder." According to a communiqué from the Indian Custodial Forces, these seven special agents "have requested that the United Nations provide them with defense lawyers." This further proves that these murderers are completely colluding with the U.S. side.

    The case of Zhang Zilong's murder illustrates to what extent the special agents mixed in the neutral nations custodial camps carried out a reign of terror against prisoners of war to prevent them from applying for repatriation, sabotaged the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and defied the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces. After being handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, Zhang Zilong had been under surveillance and persecution by special agents because he hoped to be repatriated back to his country. On October 2nd, when Chiang Kai-shek's special agents coerced prisoners of war to carry out a "demonstration" to sabotage the custody, Zhang Zilong always sternly refused, and the special agents beat him severely. He still refused to yield and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao." On October 3rd, Zhang Zilong was again subjected to torture by the special agents, including hanging, burning with fire, cutting flesh, nailing, cutting ears, and finally disemboweling and having his heart and liver removed, resulting in a tragic death. The special agents also forced prisoners of war to watch the tragic state of Zhang Zilong after being tortured and eat Zhang Zilong's heart and liver, using this to threaten them not to demand repatriation. When the Indian Custodial Forces were preparing to investigate this case, the special agents had already received the news in advance and immediately burned the body to destroy the evidence in an attempt to cover up the crime of murder.

    Many repatriated personnel from our side who have returned have confirmed that these seven Chiang Kai-shek special agents who are about to be tried are the main culprits in the Zhang Zilong murder case, but there are still many main culprits and accomplices who participated in this case who are still at large, continuing to carry out a reign of terror against prisoners of war in the camps.

    谋杀张子龙的七名特务将在下月中受审
   【新华社开城二十六日电】印度看管部队二十五日宣布：谋杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙的七名蒋匪特务，将在十二月十一日在印度看管部队的军事法庭上受审。据中立国遣返委员会给朝中方面的通知，对这些特务分子的起诉书说：这七名特务“被控犯有民间罪，那就是说，犯有谋杀罪。他们于一九五三年十月三日或这一天的前后在D营区第二十八号营场置同一营场的战俘张子龙于死命，因此犯有谋杀罪。”据印度看管部队的公报说，这七名特务“已要求通过联合国方面为他们准备辩护律师”。这进一步证明这些杀人凶手是与美方完全勾结在一起的。
    张子龙被谋杀的案件，说明混在中立国看管营场中的特务分子对战俘施行恐怖统治使之不得申请遣返，破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，蔑视中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队已经到了何等猖狂的地步。张子龙在被移交给中立国遣返委员会以后，由于希望遣返回国，就一直遭受特务分子的监视和迫害。十月二日，蒋匪特务胁迫战俘进行破坏看管的“示威游行”时，张子龙始终严词拒绝，特务们就对他施行毒打。他仍坚不屈服，并高呼“毛主席万岁”。十月三日，张子龙又被特务们吊打、火烧割肉、钉钉子、割耳朵，最后被剖腹挖去心肝而惨死。特务们还强迫战俘观看张子龙遭受酷刑后的惨状和吃张子龙的心肝，借此威胁他们不得要求遣返。在印度看管部队准备对这一案件进行调查时，特务们事先已获得消息，立即焚毁尸体，消灭罪证，以图掩饰杀人罪行。
    许多遣返归来的我方被俘人员证实：这七名即将受审的蒋匪特务是张子龙被谋杀案的主犯，但是还有许多参预这一案件的主犯和帮凶仍然逍遥法外，继续在营场内对战俘施行恐怖统治。
