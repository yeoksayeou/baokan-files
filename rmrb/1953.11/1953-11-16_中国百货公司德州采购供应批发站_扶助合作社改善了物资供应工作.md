The China Department Store Shandong Provincial Company Dezhou Procurement and Supply Wholesale Station actively supports cooperatives, gradually improving material supply work and strengthening the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperatives. In June of this year, the Dezhou Wholesale Station examined its past shortcomings in providing insufficient assistance to cooperatives and proactively apologized to the De County and Dezhou City cooperatives. Immediately following this, it organized a promotion team specifically to liaise with the cooperatives and jointly study material supply plans. For cooperatives located far from the station, it introduced commodity varieties and prices in letters to help them understand the situation. Starting in June, supply contracts were signed with Dezhou City Cooperative, De County, Deping, Shanghe, Pingyuan, Wucheng and other county cooperatives to carry out planned supply. Starting in the third quarter, installment sales contracts were also signed with some cooperatives with more difficult funding situations to help them develop their businesses. Thereafter, at the beginning of each month, the Dezhou Wholesale Station took the initiative to check the execution of the contracts with the cooperatives, and immediately sought ways to improve any problems discovered. For example, when checking the execution of the contract in July, the cooperatives proposed that: the implementation of planned procurement had begun, but the plan was not accurate enough, and the contract stipulated that no preferential treatment would be given for procurement outside the plan (note: this provision was inappropriate), and they hoped to receive appropriate consideration. Based on this situation, the Dezhou Wholesale Station revised the contract to ensure that preferential treatment was also given for procurement outside the plan. In order to help cooperatives prepare more accurate procurement plans, the Dezhou Wholesale Station dispatched specialists to research mass needs and market conditions with cooperatives for a certain period, and invited cooperative purchasers to visit the retail department to see various samples. In addition, the Dezhou Wholesale Station also sent liaison officers to the countryside to strengthen ties with grassroots cooperatives. When liaison officers went to the countryside, they went deep into the grassroots cooperatives to understand the situation and help improve their business in a more concrete way. Through these efforts, the business of cooperatives in the Dezhou area has developed, and the turnover has increased month by month. The turnover in the first and middle ten days of October was nearly twice the total turnover in June. As a result, the proportion of sales of the Dezhou Wholesale Station has also changed. The purchase of goods by the cooperatives accounted for 19.45 percent of the wholesale station’s sales in June, rising to 21.2 percent in July, 22 percent in August, 25.1 percent in September, and 36.85 percent in the first and middle ten days of October alone. Now, many cooperatives feel that the wholesale station has helped them a lot. In a report to its superiors, the De County Federation of Cooperatives said: "The cooperative has developed this year, and its business has improved, which is inseparable from the support of the Dezhou Wholesale Station to us. The Shanghe, Pingyuan and other county cooperatives have reflected that: "The Dezhou Wholesale Station supplied goods in a timely manner this year, and the cooperative's work is easier to do. The state-owned company is really the big brother of the cooperative." (Jia Zhansheng)

　　中国百货公司德州采购供应批发站
    扶助合作社改善了物资供应工作
    中国百货公司山东省公司德州采购供应批发站积极扶持合作社，逐步改善了物资供应工作，密切了国营商业和合作社的关系。今年六月，德州批发站检查了过去对合作社帮助不够的缺点，并主动向德县、德州市合作社做了检讨。紧接着就组织了专门和合作社联系的推销组，和合作社共同研究物资供应计划。对离站较远的合作社就在信件上介绍商品品种、价格，帮助他们了解情况。从六月开始，先后与德州市合作社、德县、德平、商河、平原、武城等县合作社签订了供应合同，有计划地进行供应。从第三季度开始，又和一些资金较困难的合作社签订了一次提货分期付款的赊销合同，帮助发展业务。以后，每个月月初时，德州批发站主动找合作社检查合同的执行情况，发现问题立即设法改进。如七月份检查合同执行情况时，合作社提出：开始实行计划进货，计划不够准确，但合同规定计划以外进货不予优待（按：这种规定是不适当的），希给以适当照顾。德州批发站根据这个情况将合同做了修改，确定计划以外的进货亦给予优待。为了帮助合作社编造比较准确的进货计划，德州批发站在一定时期派遣专人和合作社研究群众需要和市场情况，并邀请合作社采购员到门市部参观各种样品。此外，德州批发站还派联络员下乡，加强和基层合作社的联系。联络员下乡时，深入到基层合作社中了解情况，更具体的帮助改进业务。经过这些工作，德州地区合作社的业务有了发展，营业额逐月上升，十月份上、中两旬的营业额超过六月份全月营业额近两倍。因此，德州批发站销货的比重也发生了变化，合作社六月份的进货占批发站销货额百分之十九点四五，七月份上升为百分之二十一点二，八月份又升为百分之二十二，九月份升为百分之二十五点一，十月份仅上、中两旬就上升为百分之三十六点八五。现在，许多合作社都感到批发站对他们帮助很大。德县县联社给上级的报告中说：“合作社今年有了发展，业务上有了改进，是和德州批发站对我们的扶持分不开的。商河、平原等县社反映说：“今年德州批发站供应及时，合作社工作也好做了，国营公司真是合作社的老大哥。”（贾占升）
