Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 28th: TASS reported from Warsaw on November 28th: On November 25th, Polish People's Republic Foreign Minister Stanisław Skrzeszewski received the U.S. and British ambassadors to Warsaw and handed them two identical notes.

    The note to the United States stated that the Polish People's Government is closely following the exchange of notes between the Soviet government and the governments of Great Britain, the United States, and France regarding steps taken to ease international tensions, particularly regarding the resolution of the German question. Poland is deeply concerned about preventing the revival of German aggressive forces and resolving the German question on a democratic and peaceful basis. The world knows the extent of the destruction and losses suffered by the Polish people during the last war due to Hitler's aggression.

    The note pointed out that the U.S. government's position in its note to the Soviet government, responding to Soviet initiatives on easing international tensions and accelerating the rearmament of West Germany regardless of the real interests of all of Germany's neighbors, can only provoke strong protests. This position indicates that the U.S. government is not actually striving to resolve the German question in a spirit of peace and based on the democratic forces of Germany.

    The note recalled Poland's recent notes to Germany's neighbors and pointed out that European countries, especially Germany's neighbors, are deeply aware that the fascization of West Germany and the intensification of war propaganda are increasing the danger of West German militarization and revanchist plans, and that it is the main task of the four powers to stop the development of forces that could threaten Europe again.

    The note continued, stating that the U.S. government, disregarding its obligations to restore Germany as a unified, peaceful, and democratic state, is seeking to turn neo-Hitlerite militarist West Germany into an armed force within the "Atlantic" organization for the enslavement of Europe and aggression, which has already been established under the guise of a European "defense organization."

    The note further stated that there is no doubt that once West Germany feels it has the strength, its army, commanded by Hitler's generals, will be no different from the Hitler army known to all European countries. Despite calling this army a "European army," this truth cannot be concealed.

    The note continued, saying that the peoples of Europe clearly recognize that the danger threatening international peace can only be avoided if international tensions are eased and if the great powers reach an agreement on resolving the German question.

    The Polish government fully agrees with this view. The government of the Polish People's Republic believes that all attempts to replace a peace treaty with Germany with unilateral agreements such as the Bonn-Paris treaty are detrimental to the cause of peace. The government of the Polish People's Republic has no doubt that the correct path to easing international tensions and resolving the German question lies in a direct exchange of views through a Great Power conference.

    The note concluded by saying that the Polish government calls upon the Western Great Powers to stop the growing danger embodied in the rearmament of West Germany and its attempts to revise borders, and to abandon the attempt to force the peoples of Europe to accept a new defense force wearing "European army" uniforms.

    This is why the Polish government appeals to the U.S. government, which should support the proposals put forward by the Soviet government in its note of November 3, 1953, and work with the Soviet Union to promote the easing of international tensions.

    波兰政府照会美英两国政府
    要求通过大国协商解决德国问题
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社华沙二十八日讯：十一月二十五日，波兰人民共和国外交部长斯坦尼斯瓦夫·斯克热歇夫斯基接见美国和英国驻华沙大使并交给他们两份同样的照会。
    给美国的照会说，波兰人民政府密切注意苏联政府和英国、美国及法国政府交换的关于旨在缓和国际紧张局势，特别是关于解决德国问题所采取的步骤的照会。波兰非常关切阻止德国侵略力量的复活和在民主与和平的基础上解决德国问题。全世界都知道，在上次大战期间，由于希特勒的侵略，波兰人民遭受了何等重大的破坏和损失。
    照会指出，美国政府在致苏联政府的照会中，答复苏联关于缓和国际紧张局势和关于不顾所有德国邻国的实际利益而加速重新武装西德问题的倡议所持的立场，只能激起强烈的抗议。这一立场表明，美国政府实际上并不是依据和平精神和德国的民主力量来努力解决德国问题的。
    照会回述波兰最近致德国的邻国的照会，并指出欧洲国家，特别是德国的邻国都深切注意到，西德法西斯化和加强战争宣传正使西德军国主义化和复仇计划的危险日益增加，而制止足以再次威胁欧洲的力量的发展乃是四强的主要任务。
    照会继续说，美国政府不顾它在把德国恢复成为一个统一、和平和民主的国家所担负的义务，正设法把新希特勒军国主义的西德变成奴役欧洲和侵略的“大西洋”组织中的一支武装力量，而这支力量已在欧洲“防务组织”的掩盖下建立了起来。
    照会进一步说，毫无疑问地，当西德一旦感到它有了力量的时候，在希特勒的将领指挥下，它的军队将与欧洲一切国家所熟知的希特勒军队没有任何区别。尽管把这支军队称之为“欧洲军”，但这个真理是不能加以遮掩的。
    照会继续说，欧洲各国人民清楚认识到：只有国际紧张关系缓和下来，只有大国对解决德国问题取得协议，威胁着国际和平的危险才能避免。
    波兰政府完全同意这种主张。波兰人民共和国政府认为：用那种像波恩与巴黎条约之类的片面协定来代替对德和约的一切企图，都是危害和平事业的。波兰人民共和国政府毫不怀疑，缓和国际紧张局势以及解决德国问题的正确道路，在于通过大国会议直接交换意见。
    照会最后说，波兰政府向西方各大国政府呼吁：制止那种体现在西德的重新武装及其修改疆界的企图上的日益增长的危险，放弃那种强迫欧洲各国人民接受一支穿着“欧洲军”制服的新国防军的企图。
    这就是波兰政府向美国政府呼吁的原因，美国政府应该支持苏联政府在一九五三年十一月三日的照会中提出来的建议，并且和苏联一道去促成国际紧张关系的缓和。
