    Improving Railway Transportation to Serve National Industrialization

    Railways are an important component of the national economy and national defense, and railway transportation is closely linked to other economic sectors. Among modern means of transportation, railways are the most important, characterized by large carrying capacity, speed, safety, accuracy, and uninterrupted operation day and night. Therefore, goods transported by railways often account for more than 80 percent of the total annual freight volume. At the same time, railways connect all regions of the country and link urban and rural economies. Therefore, railway transportation is currently an important tool for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. As Lenin pointed out in 1918, "Railways are one of the most prominent manifestations of the connection between town and country, between industry and agriculture, and socialism is entirely based on this connection." After being severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandits, China's railways have completed the transportation support for the Liberation War and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea during the four years of emergency repairs, recovery, and new construction. It has also guaranteed the recovery and construction of the national economy and achieved great results, laying a good foundation for the continued development of railway work.

    Currently, the Five-Year Construction Plan has begun, and the railways are facing a serious and arduous task: how to serve national industrialization and national defense modernization, and to maximize the satisfaction of the country's large-scale economic and defense construction and the people's growing demands for railway transportation in production and life. In the past, because the national economy was still in the recovery stage, the level of railway transportation work could basically meet the objective needs. However, now the railway's transportation capacity is obviously insufficient to meet the needs. Freight consignment plans are often reduced, passenger trains often exceed the prescribed seats, the operation order is chaotic, and passenger and freight trains are often delayed. This will inevitably affect the progress of national economic construction. Therefore, all railway workers across the country must be energetic and make unremitting efforts in the following aspects to improve transportation capacity and complete the country's transportation tasks.

    First, it is necessary to fully utilize existing equipment capacity, verify and improve equipment utilization rates; rationally organize labor shifts, improve dispatching quality, and maximize the guarantee of balanced transportation and reduce fluctuation coefficients; improve line quality and eliminate slow-speed sections to increase operating speed; make every effort to organize direct trains and reduce transshipment; appropriately organize loading and unloading forces, promote non-detaching loading and unloading and non-detaching maintenance to reduce vehicle dwell time; pay attention to vehicle substitution to reduce empty running; study passenger flow conditions, appropriately attach and detach passenger cars to reduce passenger congestion and avoid empty axle operation of passenger cars; pay attention to maintenance to reduce the defect rate of locomotives and vehicles, improve maintenance methods to shorten repair downtime and repair rework rates, master full load and full axle and appropriate over-axle to improve the efficiency of locomotive and vehicle use; organize reasonable freight flow and appropriately divide work with other transportation tools to gradually eliminate unreasonable phenomena such as opposite transportation, duplicate transportation, and excessively long or short transportation. It is necessary to distinguish between primary and secondary priorities, and first ensure the transportation of the country's main materials, etc. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen enterprise operation and management to improve labor productivity and equipment utilization. It is necessary to oppose blindly and recklessly doing things without technical operating procedures, attaching importance to quantity and neglecting quality, and simply increasing labor intensity without paying attention to improving operating methods. Similarly, it is also necessary to oppose the conservative idea of ​​ignoring workers' inventions and rationalization proposals, steadily promote advanced methods, and break down outdated indicators and quotas.

    In terms of the rational use of national transportation equipment, consigning departments must and should help the railways to work together. At present, the transportation organizations of the consigning departments are not sound, consignment plans are frequently changed, the centralized delivery system has not yet been universally established, reasonable freight flow charts have not yet been formulated, and the loading and unloading equipment and loading and unloading capacity of enterprise-specific lines are not satisfactory. Therefore, transportation fluctuations are large, unreasonable transportation cannot be completely avoided, there is still a large waste in vehicle allocation, and the dwell time of vehicles on dedicated lines is still increasing. Regarding these situations, the consigning departments must strive to create conditions to gradually overcome them in order to ensure that the country's limited transportation equipment is used rationally and effectively.

    Secondly, due to the development of the national economy and the different distribution of economic and national defense construction priorities, the growth of freight volume in different regions and different sections is also unbalanced. The national railways must regularly organize investigations and study the changes in freight sources and freight flows, analyze the growth rate of freight volume in each section, in order to find out the weak links in the railway's passing capacity, study necessary measures to overcome the weak links. At the same time, it is necessary to correspondingly increase the manufacturing of locomotives and vehicles according to the increase in freight volume, strengthen the throughput capacity and marshalling capacity of hub stations, the loading and unloading capacity of freight stations, the maintenance capacity of locomotives and vehicles, and the capacity of coal and water loading, and pay attention to a certain amount of reserves to ensure meeting transportation needs.

    Furthermore, railway transportation must pay great attention to safety. At present, the serious situation of accidents has developed from freight trains to passenger trains, causing major threats to national property and people's lives, and also blocking traffic, damaging transportation equipment, disrupting the order of train operation, and seriously affecting the railway's transportation capacity. The cause of the accident is primarily due to lax labor discipline, failure to abide by rules and regulations, failure to obey dispatching orders, carelessness in work, sluggishness and procrastination, perfunctory and irresponsible attitudes, and failure to recognize that every position on the railway is important and closely related to other work. Comrade Stalin taught us: "Railway transportation is a linked machine, where the work of every worker and every screw is important." As long as one of the screws goes wrong, the huge transportation machine will shut down. To this end, it is necessary to establish a coordinated working system, strictly enforce labor discipline, establish a responsibility system universally and without exception, and fight to eliminate accidents.

    Another important reason for the accident is insufficient understanding of the conservation system, blindly raising technical indicators, lowering consumption quotas, failing to repair certain transportation equipment that must be repaired, and repairing less of what should be repaired more, thus seriously damaging the condition of railway technical equipment and reducing quality. At present, the decay rate of railway sleepers across the country is increasing year by year, the steel rails are seriously damaged, the ballast is generally insufficient to meet the standards, the roadbed has hidden pits and mud pumping, and the bridges have cracks, which seriously reduces the quality of the lines. Locomotives and vehicles are also gradually reducing in quality due to blindly prolonging maintenance kilometers and maintenance periods, and unreasonably compressing maintenance labor and material quotas. To this end, the national railways must pay close attention to various major, medium, and maintenance work, and must complete them according to plan to ensure the constant good condition of various railway technical equipment. The idea and practice of blindly saving without regard to quality must be resolutely opposed, because such savings are essentially the greatest waste.

    In order to thoroughly do the above work, the national railways must implement the study and promotion of the experience of the Sino-Soviet Railway to improve the level of railway operation and management. Learning from the experience of the Sino-Soviet Railway must be learned in essence rather than in form, learning its realistic work style of being good at combining advanced experience with specific conditions; learning its spirit of determining tasks, grasping them firmly, and implementing them to the end; learning its complete set of planning management system; learning its methods of relying on the masses, tapping potential, promoting advanced methods, and carrying out labor competitions to complete and overfulfill national plans; especially learning its methods of cultivating and promoting cadres and establishing a strict inspection system. It should be recognized that learning and promoting the experience of the Sino-Soviet Railway is the key to determining whether railway work can continue to improve in the future, so it is necessary to oppose complacency in learning, and also to oppose absolutizing the advanced experience of the Sino-Soviet Railway, emphasizing difficulties, and the lazy thinking of being content with backwardness.

    All railway workers across the country must clearly establish the view of serving national economic construction, especially serving industrial construction. Although railways, like industry and agriculture, are material production departments, the value it creates can only be added to the goods being transported during the transportation of goods. Separated from the transportation of industrial and agricultural products, the railway itself cannot create value, so railway work itself stipulates that it must serve shippers. Of course, from the perspective of the entire national economy, railways, like other economic sectors, are an indispensable and important component. Without railway transportation, some industrial and agricultural products cannot realize their use value, and therefore cannot reflect their value, or even cannot be reproduced. Therefore, in the general policy of China's Five-Year Construction Plan, in addition to focusing on the construction of heavy industry, it is stipulated that the transportation industry should be developed accordingly. It can be seen that railway transportation is inseparable from industrial and agricultural production. Railway work must adapt to the development of industry and agriculture, otherwise it will become an obstacle to the continued improvement of the national economy. Therefore, how to serve the goals of national industrialization and national defense modernization is the fundamental task of railway workers across the country.

    All railway workers across the country must continue to deepen, comprehensively, and persistently implement the campaign to increase production and practice economy. At present, railway workers across the country are responding to the call of the state and enthusiastically participating in this campaign, launching competitions, creating many advanced working methods, and improving efficiency. However, according to the current situation, the development of the movement is still uneven. Some railway bureaus have developed better, but some railway bureaus have not yet penetrated deeply because they have not grasped it tightly. What is more common is that the field is better, while the authorities are worse. At the same time, the situation of carrying out the movement in isolation without focusing on completing the planned tasks and without combining it with improving plan management and raising the responsibility system still partially exists. The situation of rushing tasks and rushing indicators, blindly saving, and disregarding quality has not yet been eliminated. The above situation must be resolutely overcome in the process of the development of the movement, so that the movement can develop steadily and persistently upward.

    In order to complete the above tasks, the national railways must also combine the current work, continue to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism, strengthen political work and ideological work, and further improve their professional and ideological levels, so as to better complete the country's transportation tasks.

### 改进铁路运输工作为国家工业化服务

    改进铁路运输工作为国家工业化服务
    铁路是国民经济和国防的重要构成部分之一，铁路运输是和其他经济部门密切相联系的。在现代交通工具中，铁路是最重要的一种，它的特点是运量大，时间快、安全、正确而且是昼夜不间断地进行运输工作。因此国家通过铁路运输的物资经常要占每年总运量的百分之八十以上；同时通过铁路把全国各地区联系起来，把城乡经济联系起来，所以铁路运输在目前又是巩固工农联盟的重要工具。列宁在一九一八年就指出：“铁路是城乡之间、工农业之间最显著的联系表现之一，社会主义完全建立在这种联系上面。”我国铁路经过国民党匪帮严重的破坏之后，在四年来抢修恢复和新建过程中，曾经完成了支援解放战争、抗美援朝的运输，并保证了国家经济的恢复和建设工作，取得了很大的成绩，为铁路工作的继续发展奠定了良好基础。
    目前五年建设计划已经开始，铁路面临着一个严重而艰巨的任务，就是如何为国家工业化和国防现代化服务，最大可能地满足国家大规模经济和国防的建设以及人民在生产上和生活上对铁路运输的日益增长的要求。过去由于国民经济尚在恢复阶段，铁路运输工作的水平基本上还能适应客观的需要。但现在铁路的运输能力显然已不敷需要，货物托运计划经常被核减，旅客列车经常超过规定座位，运行秩序紊乱，客货列车经常晚点。这就必然会影响国家经济建设的进度。因此全国铁路职工必须鼓起劲来，从以下几方面进行不懈的斗争，以提高运输能力，完成国家运输任务。
    首先，必须充分利用现有的设备能力，查定并提高设备利用率；合理组织劳动班次，提高调度质量，最大可能地保证平衡运输，缩小波动系数；提高线路质量，消灭徐行，以提高运行速度；尽一切力量组织直达列车，减少中转；适当组织装卸力量，推行不摘车装卸、不摘车检修，以减少车辆停留时间；注意车辆代用，以减少空驶；研究客流情况，适当摘挂客车以减少旅客拥挤现象，并避免客车的空轴运行；注意保养维修以减少机车车辆的不良率，改进检修方法以缩短停修时间及检修反工率，掌握满载满轴及适当超轴，以提高机车车辆的使用效率；组织合理货流及适当与其他运输工具分工，以逐步消灭相向运输、重复运输及过长过短运输等不合理现象。必须分清主次轻重，首先保证国家主要物资的输送等等。为此必须加强企业经营管理，以提高劳动生产率及设备利用率。必须反对不根据技术操作规程盲目蛮干，重视数量忽视质量，以及单纯提高劳动强度，不注意改善操作方法的作风。同样也必须反对忽视工人创造发明合理化建议的保守思想，稳步推广先进方法，打破陈旧的指标定额。
    在合理使用国家运输设备方面，托运部门必须而且应该帮助铁路共同努力。目前托运部门的运输机构还不健全，托运计划经常变更，集中送货制度还未普遍建立，合理货流图尚未制订，企业专用线的装卸设备及装卸能力还不能令人满意。因此，运输波动很大，不合理运输还不能完全避免，车辆的调配还有很大浪费，车辆在专用线上的停留时间还在增加。对于这些情况，托运部门必须努力创造条件逐步加以克服，才能保证国家有限的运输设备得到合理地有效地使用。
    其次，由于国民经济的发展及经济和国防建设重点的分布不同，因此不同地区不同区段的运量的增长也是不平衡的。全国铁路必须经常组织调查并研究货源货流的变动情况，分析各区段运量增长的速度，以便找出铁路通过能力的薄弱环节，研究必要措施，以克服薄弱环节。同时必须根据运量的增长，相应地增加机车车辆的制造，加强枢纽站的吞吐能力、编组能力、货物站的装卸能力、机车车辆的检修能力、上煤上水的能力，并注意一定数量的储备，以保证满足运输上的需要。
    再其次，铁路运输必须十分重视安全。目前事故严重情况已经从货物列车发展到旅客列车，造成对国家财产及人民生命上的重大威胁，而且阻断行车，损坏运输设备，使列车运行秩序紊乱，严重影响铁路的输送能力。事故产生的原因首先是由于劳动纪律松懈，不遵守规章制度，不服从调度命令，工作上粗枝大叶，疲沓拖拉，敷衍塞责，不认识铁路上每一个岗位都是重要的，与其他工作密切结合的。斯大林同志教导我们说：“铁路运输是联动机械，在那里每一个工作人员的工作，每一个螺丝都是重要的。”只要其中有一个螺丝出了毛病，庞大的运输机械就将停工。为此必须树立协调的工作制度，严格劳动纪律，普遍而无例外地建立责任制，为消灭事故而斗争。
    造成事故的另一个重要原因，是对节约制度理解不够，盲目提高技术指标，降低消费定额，若干运输设备必须进行修理的不修，应该多修的少修，因此严重损坏了铁路技术设备状态，降低了质量。目前全国铁路枕木腐朽率逐年增大，钢轨严重损伤，道碴普遍不足标准，道床暗坑翻浆，桥梁裂纹，严重降低了线路质量。机车车辆也由于盲目延长检修公里及检修期间，不合理地压缩检修工料定额，使质量逐渐降低。为此全国铁路必须十分注意抓紧各项大中修及维修工作，必须按计划完成，保证铁路各项技术设备的经常良好状态。那种盲目节约不顾质量的思想和做法必须坚决反对，因为这样的节约实质上是最大的浪费。
    为彻底做好以上工作，全国铁路必须贯彻学习与推广中长铁路经验，以提高铁路经营管理的水平。学习中长路经验，必须从本质上而不是从形式上去学习，学它善于把先进经验和具体情况相结合的实事求是的工作作风；学它确定任务、抓住不放、贯彻到底的精神；学它一套完整的计划管理制度；学它依靠群众，挖掘潜力，推广先进方法，开展劳动竞赛，以完成和超额完成国家计划的方法；特别要学它培养提拔干部，建立严格的检查制度。应该认识学习与推广中长路经验，是决定今后铁路工作能否继续提高的关键，所以必须反对在学习中的自满情绪，也反对把中长路先进经验绝对化，强调困难，自甘落后的懒汉思想。
    全国铁路职工必须明确树立为国家经济建设服务，特别是为工业建设服务的观点。铁路虽然和工业农业一样是物质生产部门，但他所创造的价值，只有在运输货物的过程中，才能附加在被运输的货物之上。脱离了工农业产品的运送，铁路本身不可能创造价值，因此铁路工作本身规定了必须为货主服务。当然从整个国民经济来看，铁路又与其他经济部门一样是不可缺少的重要构成部分，没有铁路运输，有些工农业产品不能实现其使用价值从而也不能体现其价值，甚至不能进行再生产。所以在我国五年建设计划总方针内，除了重点建设重工业外规定了相应地发展交通运输业，可见铁路运输与工农业生产是不可分的。铁路工作必须适应于工农业的发展，否则将成为国民经济继续提高的障碍。因此如何服务于国家工业化和国防现代化的目标是全国铁路工作者的根本任务。
    全国铁路职工必须继续深入全面地持久地贯彻增产节约运动。目前全国铁路职工正在响应国家号召，热烈地投入这个运动，展开了竞赛，创造了很多先进工作方法，提高了效率。但按目前情况看，运动的发展还不平衡，有些路局展开得较好，但有些路局由于抓得不紧至今还未深入；比较普遍的是现场较好，机关则较差。同时，不以完成计划任务为中心，不结合改善计划管理和提高责任制而孤立地搞运动的情况还部分存在。赶任务赶指标，盲目节约，不顾质量的情况尚未消除。以上情况必须在运动的发展过程中坚决予以克服，使运动稳步地持久地向上发展。
    为完成以上任务，全国铁路还必须结合当前工作，继续开展反对官僚主义、主观主义、分散主义的斗争，加强政治工作和思想工作，进一步提高业务水平和思想水平，才能更好地完成国家的运输任务。
