Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 3rd: Chief delegate of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, Li Sang-cho, received on October 28th the verdicts of the Czechoslovakian and Polish members, and the Swedish and Swiss members, respectively, of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the investigation reports submitted by the First, Second, and Third Mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Teams dispatched to South Korea. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, at the invitation of the Military Armistice Commission on August 25th, sent the First, Second, and Third Mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to Geoje Island, Yeongdeungpo, and the Imjin River Bridge in South Korea to investigate the incidents raised by the Korean-Chinese side regarding the U.S. side's violation of the armistice agreement and its unreasonable restriction and obstruction of the Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives' provision of humanitarian services to prisoners of war. These three teams returned on September 5th and 8th, respectively, and submitted investigation reports on this matter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

The full text of the verdicts of the Czechoslovakian and Polish members on the investigation reports of these three teams is as follows:

I. The investigations conducted by the First, Second, and Third Mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Teams revealed the following facts:

(1) In the Yeongdeungpo prisoner-of-war camp, starting from August 6th, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities required that congratulatory messages be submitted to them for review. They deleted several sentences from the congratulatory messages (for example, "Comrades, long live peace" or "The war is over, we are starting reconstruction work"). When the representatives of the Red Cross of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China disagreed with this practice, the congratulatory messages were prohibited from being published.

Similar measures were implemented in all prisoner-of-war camps under the control of the United Nations forces that were inspected. In the Imjin River Bridge prisoner-of-war camp, where congratulatory messages were broadcast using loudspeakers, the broadcast time was reduced to one hour per day, and the broadcast time was scheduled for the evening.

(2) Red Cross representatives were not allowed free contact with prisoners of war. Contact with prisoners of war was only allowed through the prisoners' representatives.

The Red Cross representatives were required to meet with prisoners of war in batches, with no fewer than fifty prisoners in each batch.

In the Imjin River Bridge prisoner-of-war camp, it was discovered that the prisoner representatives were designated by the prisoner-of-war camp commander. In this prisoner-of-war camp, the Red Cross representatives were only allowed to meet with one prisoner representative per day during a six-day period. In the Yeongdeungpo prisoner-of-war camp, the time for visiting prisoners of war was constantly restricted, and eventually reduced to one hour per day.

(3) In the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities did not allow visits to prisoners of war or inspections of prisoner-of-war camp facilities when the prisoners of war were in the camp grounds. In the Yeongdeungpo prisoner-of-war camp, they did not allow the Red Cross representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to accompany the prisoners of war in the same train cars.

(4) On August 31st, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities on Geoje Island required the Red Cross representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to issue a signed statement when distributing gifts, stating that they would not take advantage of the distribution of gifts to create disturbances. Because the Red Cross representatives refused to sign such a statement, the distribution of gifts was prohibited.

In the same prisoner-of-war camp, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities insisted that the Red Cross representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China had smuggled the national flags of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China into the gift bags. The prisoner-of-war camp authorities ordered an inspection of the gift bags and demanded that the Chinese and Korean representatives personally inspect the gift bags under the supervision of prisoner-of-war camp personnel. After this request was refused, the distribution of gift bags was also prohibited. However, during the inspection by the mobile inspection team, the prisoner-of-war camp commander also admitted that he had not found any national flags in the gift bags.

(5) On August 21st, the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp authorities prevented the Red Cross representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China from distributing gifts on the grounds that the prisoners of war were singing and clapping. At the same time, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities demanded that the Red Cross representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China leave the barracks. When the latter protested against this order, guards surrounded them, holding rifles and attempting to drive them out of the barracks, and these guards eventually did so. Witnesses from both sides testified that "the soldiers' rifles touched" the Red Cross representatives' "bodies." Several witnesses testified that the Red Cross representatives were beaten.

A similar incident occurred on August 13th when a Red Cross representative from the People's Republic of China was in the Imjin River Bridge prisoner-of-war camp.

On August 25th, force was used to compel the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to leave the "Winston" ship on the grounds that the prisoners of war were shouting.

On August 9th, the poison gas used against prisoners of war in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp seeped into the residence of the Red Cross representatives, affecting them as well.

(6) The Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp authorities did not allow the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to send telegrams in Korean and Chinese.

In the Imjin River Bridge prisoner-of-war camp, the deputy commander of the barracks did not allow a Chinese Red Cross representative to send a telegram unless the content of the telegram was changed according to his wishes.

II. The Polish delegation and the Czechoslovakian delegation have studied in detail the events in the prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea in order to determine whether the rules promulgated by the United Nations Command authorities and the practices in the prisoner-of-war camps violate the armistice agreement and the working agreement of the Joint Red Cross Team. These agreements were agreed upon and signed by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the one hand and the United Nations Command on the other.

After studying the reports of the mobile inspection teams in detail, the Polish delegation and the Czechoslovakian delegation have come to the following conclusion: the various facts presented in the aforementioned reports fully confirm the accusations made by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, that is, the rules promulgated by the prisoner-of-war camp authorities of the United Nations Command and the practices of the prisoner-of-war camp authorities are in violation of the armistice agreement and the working agreement of the Joint Red Cross Team, and are also in violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, and in particular:

(1) The prisoner-of-war camp authorities' censorship of congratulatory messages is in violation of subparagraph 57 of the armistice agreement and subparagraph 2 of the working agreement of the Joint Red Cross Team.

(2) The prohibition or restriction of contact with prisoners of war is in violation of subparagraph 57 of the armistice agreement and subparagraph 2 of the working agreement of the Joint Red Cross Team, as well as the provisions of Articles 125 and 126 of the Geneva Convention; in addition, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities' designation of prisoner representatives is in violation of Article 79 of the Geneva Convention.

(3) The prohibition of inspecting prisoner-of-war camp facilities and transportation is in violation of subparagraph 57 of the armistice agreement, subparagraph 2 of the August 3rd agreement (Note: i.e., the working agreement of the Joint Red Cross Team, same below), and Articles 125 and 126 of the Geneva Convention.

(4) Restrictions on the distribution of gifts are also in conflict with subparagraph 57 of the armistice agreement and Articles 125 and 126 of the Geneva Convention.

(5) Beating Red Cross representatives and using force to compel them to leave prisoner-of-war camps is in violation of subparagraph 57 of the armistice agreement, Article 13 of the August 3rd agreement, and Articles 125 and 126 of the Geneva Convention.

(6) Restrictions on communication conditions are in violation of subparagraph 57 of the armistice agreement, Article 13 of the August 3rd agreement, and Article 125 of the Geneva Convention.

III. From the above, the actions of the United Nations Command authorities are contrary to their international obligations.

It should be added that the aforementioned authorities cite their own rules promulgated in the prisoner-of-war camps, rather than their international obligations. First, this is the "Standard Operating Procedure" promulgated by the United Nations Command authorities on August 6th. The provisions of Articles 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d) of this procedure stipulate that the minimum number of prisoners of war in each batch when contacting prisoners of war is fifty; these articles prohibit contact and talks with prisoners of war unless explicit permission is obtained from the prisoner-of-war camp commander; these articles also stipulate that the content of speeches must be reviewed in advance. The promulgation of this procedure is a violation of the provisions of the armistice agreement, the August 3rd agreement, and the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War cited in Part II above.

The above rules and the resulting events have greatly hindered the activities of the Joint Red Cross Team in South Korea.

IV. The investigation by the mobile inspection teams in the prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea also revealed certain facts which, according to the Polish delegation and the Czechoslovakian delegation, are positively related to the above-mentioned restrictions on the activities of Red Cross representatives. These facts reveal the inhuman treatment suffered by prisoners of war.

The mobile inspection teams also witnessed the use of poison gas against prisoners of war during their investigations. Some prisoners of war were injured as a result of the use of poison gas. This poison gas was used against prisoners of war in the Chugori camp on Geoje Island.

In Camp No. 11 of this prisoner-of-war camp, one prisoner of war was completely blinded and three prisoners of war each lost one eye during an attack on prisoners of war on August 20th. The United Nations Command authorities do not deny that they used poison gas.

In particular, poison gas was also used at the Imjin River Bridge on August 14th, 15th, and 18th. Prisoners of war were carried out of the prisoner-of-war camp after being attacked with poison gas. Many prisoners of war became ill as a result of being attacked with poison gas.

The facts of beating and injuring prisoners of war have also been confirmed, especially in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp. In addition, it has also been proven that prisoners of war in the Imjin River Bridge prisoner-of-war camp have also been injured.

It is worth noting that prisoners of war dared not speak when providing evidence to the First Mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team; they said that they had been beaten for answering questions before.

The above facts violate Articles 13 and 14 of the Geneva Convention.

The Polish delegation and the Czechoslovakian delegation believe that the restrictions on the activities of the Joint Red Cross Team in the prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea are closely related to the above-mentioned poor treatment of prisoners of war, and therefore, the Red Cross representatives are hindered in investigating incidents of infringement of prisoners' rights.

    美方阻挠我红十字会代表进行工作的罪行
    ——中立国监察委员会捷、波两国委员对派赴南朝鲜的三个机动中立国视察小组调查报告的判语
    【新华社开城三日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在十月二十八日收到中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员、及瑞典委员和瑞士委员分别对于派赴南朝鲜的第一、第二、第三机动中立国视察小组提出的调查报告所作的判语。中立国监察委员会在八月二十五日应军事停战委员会的邀请，派遣第一、第二、第三机动中立国视察小组赴南朝鲜的巨济岛、永登浦和临津江桥，调查朝中方面提出的美方违反停战协定，无理限制和阻挠朝中红十字会代表对战俘提供人道主义服务的事件。这三个小组在九月五日和八日先后返回，向中立国监察委员会提出了此项事件的调查报告。
    捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员对这三个小组的调查报告所作的判语的全文如下：
    一、第一、第二、第三机动中立国视察小组所进行的调查透露了以下的几件事实：
    （一）在永登浦战俘营中，从八月六日开始，战俘营当局要求把慰问词送给他们检查。他们从慰问词中删去了几句话（例如：“同志，和平万岁”、或“战争已经结束了，我们开始复兴工作了”），当朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的红十字会代表不同意这样的做法时，慰问词就被禁止发表。
    在所有视察过的联合国军方面控制的战俘营中都实行了类似的办法。在用扩音器来广播慰问词的临津江桥战俘营中，广播的时间限制被减少到每天一小时，而且广播的时间排在晚上。
    （二）红十字会代表不得和战俘自由接触。只有通过战俘的代表才能和战俘接触。
    红十字会代表每次分批会见的战俘，每批不得少于五十名。
    在临津江桥战俘营中发现，战俘代表是由战俘营长官指定的。在这个战俘营中，红十字会代表在六天期间每天只能会见一名战俘代表。在永登浦战俘营中，访问战俘的时间不断受到限制，最后减少到每天一小时。
    （三）在巨济岛战俘营里，当战俘们在营场里的时候，战俘营当局不准去访问战俘，和视察战俘营的设备。在永登浦战俘营里，他们不准朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的红十字会代表们陪同战俘坐在同一辆战俘所搭乘的火车里。
    （四）八月三十一日，巨济岛的战俘营当局要求朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的红十字会代表们在散发馈赠品的时候，要发表一项经过签字的声明，表示他们不会借散发馈赠品之便而制造骚乱。因为红十字会的代表们拒绝签署这样的声明，于是馈赠品的分发工作遂被禁止。
    在同一战俘营内，战俘营当局硬说朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的红十字会代表们把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的国旗放在馈赠袋里偷运进来。战俘营当局下令检查馈赠袋，并且要求在战俘营人员的监视之下由中国和朝鲜的代表们亲自检查。这个要求被拒绝以后，馈赠袋的分发工作也被禁止。不过，在机动视察小组进行检查的时候，战俘营长官也承认他在馈赠袋里没有发现国旗。
    （五）在八月二十一日，巨济岛战俘营当局阻止了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的红十字会代表散发馈赠品；理由是战俘在唱歌和拍手。同时，战俘营当局要求朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的红十字会代表们离开营房。当后者对这种命令提出抗议时，卫兵包围了他们，持着步枪要想把他们赶出营房，而且这些卫兵最后确是这样做了。双方的目击者证明：“士兵们的步枪触着了”红十字会代表们的“身体”。若干目击者证明：红十字会代表曾遭殴击。
    八月十三日有一个中华人民共和国的红十字会代表在临津江桥战俘营里时，也发生了类似的事件。
    在八月二十五日，为了迫使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表们离开“温斯顿”轮，曾经使用了武力；理由是战俘们在大叫。
    在八月九日，在巨济岛战俘营中对战俘使用的毒气，渗入到红十字会代表的住处，使他们也被波及。
    （六）巨济岛战俘营当局不使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表们有可能用朝鲜文和中国文拍电报。
    在临津江桥战俘营中，营房副长官不让一个中国红十字会代表拍电报，除非把电文内容照他的意思改过来。
    二、波兰代表团和捷克斯洛伐克代表团曾详细地研究了在南朝鲜的战俘营中的事件，为了要断定联合国军司令部当局所颁布的规则和战俘营中的做法是否违反停战协定和联合红十字会小组的工作协议。这些协定是由朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面与联合国军司令部方面所同意而签订的。
    波兰代表团和捷克斯洛伐克代表团在详细地研究了机动视察小组的报告以后，得出下面的结论：上述报告中提出的种种事实完全证实了朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的指责，这就是说，联合国军司令部战俘营当局颁布的规则和战俘营当局的做法都是违背停战协定和联合红十字会小组的工作协议的，而且也是违背一九四九年关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的，而且特别是：
    （一）战俘营当局检查慰问词，是违背停战协定第五十七款子项和联合红十字会小组的工作协议第二条子项的。
    （二）禁止或限制与战俘接触，是违背停战协定第五十七款子项和联合红十字会小组的工作协议第二条子项以及日内瓦公约第一百二十五条和一百二十六条的规定的；此外，战俘营当局指定战俘代表是违背日内瓦公约第七十九条的。
    （三）禁止视察战俘营的设备与交通工具，是违背停战协定第五十七款子项，八月三日的协议
  （按：即联合红十字会小组的工作协议，以下同）的第二条子项和日内瓦公约第一百二十五条和一百二十六条的。
    （四）在分配馈赠品方面的限制，也是和停战协定第五十七款子项以及日内瓦公约第一百二十五条和第一百二十六条相冲突的。
    （五）殴打红十字会代表以及用武力迫使他们离开战俘营，是违反停战协定第五十七款子项，八月三日协议第十三条以及日内瓦公约第一百二十五条和第一百二十六条的。
    （六）对于联络条件的限制是违反停战协定第五十七款子项、八月三日协议第十三条以及日内瓦公约第一百二十五条的。
    三、从上面看来，联合国军司令部当局的行为是与他们的国际义务背道而驰的。
    应当补充的是：上述当局引用他们自己在战俘营中所颁布的规则，而不是他们的国际义务。首先，这是联合国军司令部当局在八月六日颁布的“标准工作程序”。该程序的第二条甲项、第二条乙项、第二条丙项以及第二条丁项的条款规定：和战俘接触时，每批战俘人数最少为五十人；这些条款禁止和战俘接触及会谈，除非得到战俘营长官的明确的允许；这些条款还规定发表谈话的内容得事先经过审查。颁布这种程序是违反上面第二部分所引的停战协定、八月三日协议以及关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的条款的。
    上述规则和因而引起的事件大大地妨碍了联合红十字会小组在南朝鲜的活动。
    四、机动视察小组在南朝鲜的战俘营的调查还透露了某些事实，据波兰代表团和捷克斯洛伐克代表团认为，这些事实是与上述限制红十字会代表活动一事有肯定关系的。这些事实揭露了战俘所受的非人道待遇。
    机动视察小组在进行调查时还看到了对战俘使用毒气的事实。由于使用毒气，有一些战俘曾受到伤害。这种毒气曾对巨济岛猪仇里营场的战俘使用过。
    在这个战俘营的第十一号营场里，在八月二十日对战俘进攻时，有一名战俘双目完全失明，有三名战俘，每人都有一目失明。联合国军司令部当局并不否认他们使用过毒气。
    尤其是，在八月十四日、十五日和十八日，在临津江桥也使用过毒气。战俘在受到毒气进攻后，被抬出战俘营。许多战俘由于受到毒气的进攻而生了病。
    殴打战俘和打伤战俘的事实，也被确定属实了，尤其是在巨济岛战俘营。此外还经证明：临津江桥战俘营的战俘也有人曾被打伤。
    值得注意的是：战俘在向第一机动中立国视察小组提供证据时，都不敢说话；他们说，在此以前，他们曾因回答问题而遭殴打。
    上述事实违反日内瓦公约第十三条和第十四条。
    波兰代表团和捷克斯洛伐克代表团认为：联合红十字会小组在南朝鲜战俘营的活动受到限制，是与上面所说的对战俘的不良态度有密切关系的，因此，红十字会代表在调查侵犯战俘权利事件方面受到阻碍。
