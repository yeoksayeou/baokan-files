    Xinjiang's state-owned trading departments and cooperatives are actively purchasing livestock products from herdsmen. Currently, the summer purchasing work has ended, and relevant departments are actively purchasing autumn pastoral products.
      Xinjiang Province's livestock economy accounts for approximately 26% of the national livestock economy, producing various types of wool, hides, casings, and livestock. Livestock products are the primary source of livelihood for people in the pastoral areas of Xinjiang Province and have significant export value.
      In order to purchase livestock products from herdsmen in a timely and reasonable manner, relevant departments in Xinjiang Province made full preparations well in advance of the commencement of livestock product purchasing this year. In early May, the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee uniformly adjusted and increased the wool prices across the province (excluding the Dihua area). The increase ranged from 1% to 87%. The Provincial Department of Commerce, the Provincial Trading Company, and the Provincial Cooperative Bureau have all issued instructions to their respective units to actively carry out the purchase of livestock products. Generally, purchasing points have been increased in various locations, and trade forces have been expanded. The Yili Prefecture Trading Company has increased its purchasing force by one and a half times this year compared to last year. Manager Ka Ma Li Ding and Deputy Manager Li Qiang have personally gone deep into pastoral areas with mobile trade teams to carry out work. In remote areas such as Ruoqiang and Qiemo counties, new purchasing stations and mobile trade teams have also been established this year.
    Many mobile trade teams and purchasing stations have paid attention to simplifying purchasing procedures to facilitate herdsmen. At the same time, they have conscientiously implemented the state's price policy, allowing herdsmen to obtain more income.
    Due to the fact that various regions have promoted the state's policy of "grading and pricing" and "better prices for better goods" to herdsmen during the purchasing process, and have provided guidance to herdsmen on production techniques, the quality of livestock products has generally improved this year. After the second district of Tuoli County convened a meeting of herdsmen to study wool shearing techniques, wool production and quality greatly improved. In the past, one hundred sheep could only shear more than eighty kilograms of wool; this year, one hundred sheep can shear more than one hundred and sixty kilograms of wool. Herdsmen in Hami, Zhenxi, and Yiwu counties have all adopted the method of "separating wool by color" this year, and the quality of wool is better than in any previous year.
    In the work of purchasing livestock products, all regions have attached importance to the supply of materials, so that herdsmen can buy production materials and living materials at any time after selling livestock products. The relevant commercial departments of the province have expanded supply plans and increased the variety of goods in a timely manner based on actual needs and the preferences of various ethnic groups. In September alone, the Trading Company transported more than 260 tons of materials to six prefectures, including Kashi, Aksu, Shache, and Hotan. Under the leadership of the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee, relevant departments are now concentrating their efforts to complete the transfer of more than 2,000 tons of materials before winter, in order to ensure the supply of materials during the period before the ice and snow melt and transportation resumes next year.

    新疆国营贸易部门和合作社收购牧业产品
    新疆省国营贸易部门和合作社积极收购牧民的畜产品。目前，夏季收购工作已经结束，各有关部门正积极收购秋季牧业产品。
      新疆省的畜牧经济，约占全国畜牧经济的百分之二十六，出产各种羊毛、皮张、肠衣和牲畜。牧业产品是新疆省牧区人民的主要生活来源，且有很大出口价值。
      为了及时、合理地收购牧民的畜产品，新疆省各有关部门今年在开始收购牧业产品以前，都及早作了充分的准备工作。该省财政经济委员会在五月初旬统一调整和提高了全省（除迪化专区）的羊毛价格。提高的幅度为百分之一到百分之八十七。省商业厅、省贸易公司和省合作局，都曾分别指示所属单位，积极进行牧业产品的收购工作。各地一般都增设了收购点，扩大了贸易力量。伊犁专区的贸易公司，今年比去年增加了一倍半的收购力量，经理卡麻里丁和副经理李强，都亲自和流动贸易小组深入到牧区进行工作。边远地区的婼羌、且末等县，今年也新设立了收购站和流动贸易小组。
    许多流动贸易小组和收购站，注意简化了收购手续，便利牧民。同时认真贯彻了国家的价格政策，使牧民得到更多的收益。
    由于各地在收购中向牧民宣传了国家“分等论价”、“优货优价”的政策，从生产技术上对牧民进行了指导，今年牧业产品的质量普遍提高。托里县第二区召集牧民开会，研究了剪羊毛的技术以后，羊毛产量和质量大大提高。过去一百只羊只能剪八十余公斤毛；今年一百只羊可剪毛一百六十多公斤；哈密、镇西、伊吾等县的牧民，今年都采用了“分色剪毛”的办法，羊毛的质量比过去那一年都好。
    在牧业产品收购工作中，各地都重视了物资供应工作，使牧民卖了牧业产品后，能随时买到生产资料和生活资料。该省各有关商业部门，都根据实际需要和各族人民的爱好，适时地扩大了供应计划，增加了商品品种。九月份，只贸易公司一个单位，就向喀什、阿克苏、莎车、和阗等六个专区运去物资二百六十余吨。在该省财政经济委员会的领导下，各有关部门现正集中力量，准备在入冬以前完成二千余吨物资的调运工作，以保证做好在明年冰雪解冻、交通恢复前一时期的物资供应工作。
