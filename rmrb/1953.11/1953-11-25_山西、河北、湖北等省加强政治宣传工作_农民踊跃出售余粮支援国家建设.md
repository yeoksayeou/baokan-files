    Shanxi, Hebei, Hubei and other provinces strengthen political propaganda work
    Farmers enthusiastically sell surplus grain to support national construction
    [Report from this newspaper] Since October, CCP organizations at all levels and people's governments at all levels in Shanxi Province have vigorously promoted the general line to farmers, strengthened political education for farmers, and more and more farmers have enthusiastically sold surplus grain to the state to support national economic construction.
    Since October, CCP organizations and people's governments at all levels in Shanxi Province have vigorously promoted the general line to farmers, and have strengthened the political education for farmers. More and more farmers have enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state. For example, Fan Qingzhi, a farmer from Jicun Village, Fourth District of Fencheng, sold ten dan of wheat that he had saved to the state after clearly understanding the relationship between the individual and the state. The number of large-scale grain sellers in various places has increased significantly since October. For example, the Li Genzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huata Village, a suburb of Taiyuan City, sold 21,700 jin of grain to the state in one go on October 14; the Niu Chouzhe Mutual Aid Team in Niujiazhuang, Wuxiang, collectively sold 53 shi of grain; the four mutual aid teams of Han Changfu, Han Ying, Zhao Huangxi, and Wei Bingzhong in the Fifth District of Xin County sold a total of 42,665 jin of grain. This was a rare phenomenon in the previous months. Thanks to farmers' enthusiastic sales of surplus grain to the state, Shanxi Province overfulfilled its grain purchase plan in October.
    The Hebei Provincial People's Government recently sent a group of grain purchasing teams to the countryside to carry out political propaganda work among farmers. These grain purchasing teams were welcomed by the farmers. After the grain purchasing team arrived at Bianjiayao Village, Anci County, the farmers carried their grain bags on their backs and shoulders to the grain purchasing station to sell. Within half a day, 30 farmers in the village sold more than 9,000 jin of grain. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and rural grassroots cadres are playing an active role in farmers' enthusiastic grain sales. Ren Derong, secretary of the Wanggezhuang Township General Branch of the CCP in Tong County, took the lead in selling 400 jin of grain to the state, driving farmers throughout the township to enthusiastically sell grain. In just two days, state-owned grain departments collected more than 15,600 jin of pre-purchased grain in this township. This year, farmers in Hebei Province who participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations harvested more grain than individual farmers, and they actively sold grain to the state. For example, the Xiaobeijiangou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ninghe County harvested a total of 1,037,000 jin of rice from more than 1,700 mu of rice paddies this year. After harvesting the rice, in addition to leaving seeds, public grain, and food, the cooperative quickly sold 840,000 jin of rice to the state.
    Party committees and government cadres at all levels in Hubei Province's Xishui, Wuchang, and Qichun counties have successively conducted education on the socialist future for rural activists in mutual aid team leader training classes or key mutual aid teams. The political consciousness of the farmers has been greatly improved, and they have sold their surplus grain to the state one after another. The Xiong Huashu Mutual Aid Team in Wuchang County had a surplus of 61 shi of rice this year. A few days ago, only the team leader sold 20 shi of grain to the state, and the rest did not sell. After being educated about the socialist future, everyone prepared to sell all the surplus grain to the state and prepare to purchase farm tools and fertilizers to expand production. The farmers of the Liu Yousheng Mutual Aid Team in Qichun County sold more than 8,000 jin of grain to the state after listening to the propaganda.
    Zhejiang Province had a very good harvest this year. Many farmers enthusiastically sold surplus grain to the state. When selling grain, village cadres, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams in various places have played a leading role. Hua Yue'e, the female township head of Longshan Township, Fuyang County, after attending a meeting of party members, League members, and party propagandists convened in the township, understood the significance of the state's acquisition of grain, and after the meeting, sold more than 2,400 jin of grain to the cooperative. Her patriotic actions influenced farmers throughout the township, and all mutual aid teams sold their surplus grain to the state. For example, the Jin Guanxue and Cai Guanzhen mutual aid teams in Yangqing Village sold more than 6,300 jin of rice in one go. The Sun Xiangchun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fangmen Township, Fenghua County, has sold 40,000 jin of surplus grain after the autumn harvest this year, and recently, after discussion, sold another 7,500 jin. After selling the surplus grain, in addition to buying back means of production and means of living, repaying agricultural loans, farmers also deposited the remaining money in the People's Bank of China and participated in patriotic savings.

    山西、河北、湖北等省加强政治宣传工作
    农民踊跃出售余粮支援国家建设
    【本报讯】山西、河北、湖北、浙江等省许多农民在认识到国家收购粮食的意义以后，踊跃把余粮卖给国家，支援国家经济建设。
    十月份以来，山西省中共各级组织和各级人民政府大张旗鼓地向农民宣传总路线，加强了对农民的政治教育工作，愈来愈多的农民踊跃地把余粮卖给国家。如汾城四区吉村农民樊清智在认识清楚了个人和国家的关系以后，将存下来的十大石小麦卖给了国家。各地卖大宗粮的，十月份以来增加不少。如太原市郊区花塔村李根柱农业生产合作社十月十四日一次卖给国家二万一千七百斤粮食；武乡牛家庄牛臭则互助组集体售粮五十三石；忻县五区韩昌富、韩英、赵黄喜、蔚炳中四个互助组共售粮四万二千六百六十五斤。这是以前几个月不多有的现象。由于农民踊跃把余粮卖给国家，山西省十月份购粮工作超额完成了计划。
    河北省各级人民政府最近派了一批购粮组到农村向农民进行政治宣传工作。这些购粮组受到了农民的欢迎。购粮组到安次县边家窑村后，农民背着、扛着粮袋一齐到购粮站去出售。半天时间内，这个村三十户农民共卖出了九千多斤粮食。在农民踊跃售粮中，农村中的共产党员和青年团员、农村基层干部起着积极作用。中共通县王各庄乡总支书记任德荣首先把四百斤粮食卖给国家，带动全乡农民踊跃售粮。仅两天工夫，国营粮食部门就在这个乡收起了一万五千六百多斤预购粮。今年河北省各地参加互助合作组织的农民比个体农民收获了更多的粮食，他们积极出售粮食给国家。如宁河县小北涧沽农业生产合作社，今年全社一千七百多亩稻田，共收了一百零三万七千斤稻谷。该社在稻谷收获以后，除了留下籽种、公粮、吃的粮食，很快就把八十四万斤稻谷卖给了国家。
    湖北省浠水、武昌、蕲春等县各级党委、政府干部先后在互助组长训练班或重点互助组内，向农村积极分子进行了社会主义前途的教育。农民的政治觉悟大大提高，纷纷把余粮卖给国家。武昌县熊华庶互助组今年全组剩余稻谷六十一石，前些日子，全组只有组长卖了二十石粮给国家，其余的都没卖。经过社会主义前途的教育，大家准备把余粮全部卖给国家，并准备添购农具、肥料，扩大生产。蕲春县刘有生互助组的农民听了宣传后，就先后卖了八千多斤谷子给国家。
    浙江省今年的庄稼收成很好。许多农民踊跃把余粮卖给国家。在出卖粮食时，各地乡村干部、农业生产合作社、互助组大都起了带头作用。富阳县龙山乡女乡长华月娥经过参加乡里召开的党员、团员及党的宣传员会议，了解了国家收购粮食的意义，会后把二千四百多斤粮食卖给合作社。她这一爱国行动影响了全乡农民，各互助组都把余粮卖给国家。如杨清村金关雪、蔡关珍两个互助组一次就卖出六千三百多斤稻谷。奉化县方门乡孙祥春农业生产合作社今年秋收后已卖出余粮四万斤，最近经过讨论，又卖出七千五百斤。农民卖出余粮后，除买回生产资料、生活资料，归还农业贷款外，并把余钱存入人民银行，参加爱国储蓄。
