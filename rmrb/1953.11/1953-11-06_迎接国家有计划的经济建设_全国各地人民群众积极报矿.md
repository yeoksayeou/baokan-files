To welcome the planned economic construction of the motherland, people across the country, with unparalleled enthusiasm, are actively reporting mineral deposits to the government. From the beginning of the year to the end of August, the Northeast Geological Bureau's Mass Reporting Mineral Deposits Section received 222 letters from the public reporting mineral deposits, reporting 108 mineral deposits; the Central South Geological Bureau received more than 200 letters from various places reporting mineral deposits from January to August this year; the Southwest Geological Bureau received 277 letters reporting mineral deposits in the two months from May to July; the Northwest Geological Bureau received 54 letters from the public reporting mineral deposits from June 10 to July 23, more than double the number in the first quarter of this year; the East China and North China Geological Bureaus also received many letters from the public reporting mineral deposits this year. The minerals reported by the masses include copper, iron, zinc, petroleum, manganese, gold, silver, nickel, asbestos, mica, gemstones, clay, asphalt, nitrate, realgar, gypsum, sulfur, white clay, alum, and so on. The people reporting the minerals include workers, farmers, cadres, students, teachers, revolutionary soldiers, etc. The enthusiastic reporting of minerals by the people has provided many valuable clues for the country's resource exploration work. Based on these clues, relevant departments have discovered many kinds of mineral deposits that were previously unknown. The white mica sample sent by Wu Xibiao of Lichuan County, Jiangxi Province, to the East China Geological Bureau was transferred to the user factory for preliminary identification, and it was proved to basically meet the standards of electrical insulation materials, which provided the country with a new and important resource producing area for industrial construction needs. After preliminary technical appraisal and testing of the mineral samples reported by the masses, the Northwest Geological Bureau believes that some of them are very important minerals, with a high content of mineral components. Some contain as much as 82.48 percent lead, 48.53 percent manganese, and 64.69 percent iron. The discovery of these mineral deposits is of great help to the construction of China's heavy industry.

In the process of reporting mineral deposits, the people's concern and enthusiasm for developing the motherland's underground resources were fully demonstrated. Chen Cedomg, an old worker from Chongqing 102 Factory, personally brought mineral samples and detailed information on mineral deposits to the Southwest Geological Bureau. Jin Tingquan in the Northeast District, who is already over fifty years old, has traveled tirelessly many times to report mineral deposits. During the two-day "May Day" holiday this year, he took the opportunity to walk sixty or seventy miles to collect mineral sample specimens. When the Northeast Geological Bureau came to the local area for exploration, Jin Tingquan led the exploration team and introduced the local situation in detail. Zhang Guangshi, who has decades of research experience in minerals, wrapped the manganese ore samples he had kept for six or seven years in a towel and sent them to the Northwest Geological Bureau. He had more than three years of exploration and understanding of this mining area. He told the comrades of the Mass Reporting Mineral Deposits Section of the Northwest Geological Bureau: "I must write the details of this mining area into detailed materials for your reference in geological survey." Elementary school teacher Li Zongdao reported mineral deposits to the Northwest Geological Bureau several times. Once, he found iron ore in one place, and went to visit an old worker who had worked in a small coal mine there. It is said that there is a thick layer of pyrite about three or four feet deep from the ground, which is very hard. Based on this clue, he personally waded into the water to enter the cave. When entering the cave, he tied one end of the rope to his waist and the other end to a椿 tree, and asked several older students to pull it hard, slowly sending it into the cave, and finally discovered the mineral deposit. Some elementary school teachers also reported to relevant departments whenever they found minerals during field trips with their students.

The Geological Bureaus of major regions and the people's governments at all levels cherish the letters and mineral samples reported by the masses. Each geological bureau has established a special "Mass Reporting Mineral Deposits Section." The Mass Reporting Mineral Deposits Section of the Southwest Geological Bureau registers the minerals reported by the masses separately according to region and mineral type, so that they can plan to concentrate certain manpower to conduct systematic preliminary investigation work based on these data. Now, a preliminary investigation team has been formed to conduct preliminary investigations in Xuyong, Gulin and other counties in Sichuan Province. The Northwest Geological Bureau has formulated a mass reporting mineral deposit registration form to facilitate the masses in discovering mineral sources. The bureau has now dispatched two groups of outcrop teams to designated areas for survey based on the important mineral data reported by the masses. The Shaanxi Xianyang County, Baoji City People's Government, Gansu Province Guyuan, Li County, Xihe and other People's Governments and the Gansu Provincial People's Government Industry Department and other agencies, timely sent the letters and mineral samples received from the masses to the Northwest Geological Bureau, which helped the work of the Northwest Geological Bureau and greatly saved manpower, financial resources and time.

In order to further improve the mass reporting mineral deposit work, the Southwest Geological Bureau and the Gansu Provincial Department of Industry recently formulated a temporary method for mass reporting mineral deposits to guide the masses on how to discover mineral sources and what issues should be paid attention to when reporting mineral deposits. The Southwest Geological Bureau recently collected more than 30 kinds of common mineral rock specimens and sent these specimens to the cultural centers of various counties for public display to help the masses further identify minerals. At the same time, they also invited several comrades with work experience to write popular readings on identifying common minerals for the masses to refer to in identifying minerals.

    迎接国家有计划的经济建设
    全国各地人民群众积极报矿
    全国各地人民群众，怀着无比的热情，以积极向政府报矿的行动，来迎接祖国有计划的经济建设。东北地质局群众报矿科自今年年初到八月底止，已收到二百二十二件群众报矿信，所报矿藏达一百零八处；中南地质局从今年一月到八月，收到各地群众报矿信件二百多件；西南地质局从五月到七月，两个月时间就收到二百七十七件报矿信件；西北地质局从六月十日到七月二十三日，共接到群众报矿信五十四件，超过今年第一季度的两倍以上；华东、华北地质局今年也收到不少群众报矿信件。群众所报的矿物有铜、铁、锌、石油、锰、金、银、镍、石棉、云母、宝石，黏土、沥青、硝、雄黄、石膏、硫磺、白土、礬等等。报矿的群众有工人、农民、干部、学生、教职员、革命军人等。人民群众的踊跃报矿，为国家资源勘探工作提供了很多宝贵的线索，根据这些线索，使有关部门发现了许多种过去不知道的矿藏。江西省黎川县吴锡标寄给华东地质局的白云母矿样，经转给使用工厂初步鉴定，证明基本上合乎电气绝缘器材的标准，这就给国家提供了一个新的可供工业建设需要的重要资源产地。西北地质局对群众所报的矿样，经过初步技术鉴定和化验后，认为其中有些是很重要的矿产，矿质成份含量很多，有的含铅竟占百分之八十二点四八，有的含锰百分之四十八点五三，有的含铁百分之六十四点六九。这些矿藏的发现，对于我国的重工业建设帮助很大。
    在报矿过程中，充分表现了人民群众对开发祖国地下资源的关怀与热情。重庆一○二厂老工人陈策东亲自带着矿样及详细的报矿资料送到西南地质局。东北区金廷泉，今年已经五十多岁了，为了报矿不辞辛苦地屡次奔走，今年“五一”节放假两天，他趁此机会走六、七十里地去打矿样标本。东北地质局到当地勘察的时候，金廷泉又给勘察队带路，并详细介绍当地的情况。对于矿产具有几十年研究经验的张广石，把他保存了六、七年的锰矿矿样，用手巾包好送到西北地质局，他对这一矿区曾有三年多的勘察了解，他对西北地质局群众报矿科的同志谈：“我一定要把这个矿区的情况写成详细材料，供你们进行地质普查参考。”小学教员李宗道，几次向西北地质局报矿。有一次，他在一个地方发现了铁矿，便去访问曾在那里下过小煤井的老工人，据说离地面有三四丈深的地方，即有较厚的黄铁矿层，很坚硬。他根据这个线索，亲自?水下洞。下洞时，他把绳子的一端系在腰里，另一端绑在椿树上，叫几个年龄较大的学生用力拉着，慢慢地往洞里送，终于发现了矿藏。还有一些小学教员带领学生远足时，发现矿物，随时向有关部门报告。
    各大区的地质局和各级人民政府对群众的报矿信件和矿样，都很珍重。各地质局专门成立了“群众报矿科”。西南地质局群众报矿科对群众所报的矿都分别依照地区、矿别，分类进行登记，以便有计划地根据这些资料，集中一定的人力进行系统的预查工作。现在已组成一个预查队到四川省叙永、古蔺等县进行预查。西北地质局拟定了群众报矿登记表，便利群众发现矿源。该局现已根据群众报来的重要矿产资料，派出露头队的两个小组，分赴指定地区进行勘测。西北区陕西?阳县、宝鸡市人民政府、甘肃省固原、礼县、西和等人民政府和甘肃省人民政府工业厅等机关，都将他们收到的群众报矿信件及矿样，及时寄到西北地质局，帮助了西北地质局的工作，大大节省了人力、财力和时间。
    为了进一步作好群众报矿工作，西南地质局和甘肃省工业厅最近特制订了一个群众报矿暂行办法，指导群众怎么样发现矿源和报矿时应注意那些问题。西南地质局最近搜集了三十多种普通的矿物岩石标本，将这些标本送到各县文化馆去公开陈列，以帮助群众进一步识别矿物。同时他们还约了几位有工作经验的同志，撰写有关识别普通矿物的通俗读物，供群众识别矿物的参考。
