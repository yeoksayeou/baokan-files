    Political and Ideological Work of Party Organizations in Factories and Mines in Taiyuan City in Improving Technical Management
    Wang Daren, Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Last autumn, state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan City conducted a quality inspection, establishing a concept of quality importance among all employees and improving product quality. However, since the focus at the time was only on resolving ideological issues, and these weren't implemented and consolidated in various regulations and systems. In addition, with the development of the country's planned economic construction, factories and mines needed to pay more attention to safe production, product quality requirements became stricter, and there was a demand for continuous production of new products. Under these circumstances, it was increasingly felt that technical management work could not adapt to the new needs. This situation was particularly serious in power plants and machine manufacturing plants. In these units, accidents were frequent, serious scrap occurred, rework was rampant, production order was extremely chaotic, and production tasks were continuously unfulfilled. From January to June this year, Taiyuan's No. 2 and No. 4 power plants experienced 109 accidents, resulting in 12,755 fewer kilowatt-hours of electricity delivered. One factory only completed 3.2 percent of its monthly plan in May; among 44 types of product parts, there were 116 quality accidents, with a rework rate as high as 1300 percent. The maintenance and repair work of machinery and equipment in various factories and mines was also poorly done. One factory had 2,094 hours of machine repair work in April. One machine broke down and was repaired, then broke down again. It was continuously repaired nine times in one month, with downtime reaching 273 hours.
    Therefore, since April, on the basis of discussing this year's national plan, and in accordance with the guidelines stipulated by the higher-level departments in charge of each enterprise, combined with the actual situation of each factory and mine, we have improved technical management work in the process of strengthening planning management. The effect of this work has been very good. In the past four months, not only has product quality improved, but production efficiency has also greatly increased due to the reduction of rework waste and accidents. For example, if the total value of goods from three machinery factories from January to May is counted as 100, then it increased to 134.39 to 642.5 in June and July. In terms of product quality, the qualified rate of a certain process in a certain factory rose from 72 percent in May to 92.9 percent in July. The first-class product rate of another process rose from 5.3 percent in May to 100 percent in July. The adjustment rate of unqualified products in a certain process was 44 percent in May, and decreased to zero in July.
    In the work of improving technical management, the party organizations of each factory have strengthened political and ideological work in the following aspects.
    First, vigorously change the empiricist leadership methods, promote investigation and research, learn and master new professional knowledge, and improve technical management.
    For a long time, the leading ideology and methods of leadership cadres in many factories and mines in Taiyuan City have been characterized by serious conservatism and empiricism. They are satisfied with past achievements and have insufficient understanding of the contradiction between the current precise requirements for product quality and the backward state of existing technical levels and technical equipment, especially technical management. When dealing with technical problems in production, they do not grasp the basic link of improving technical management, rely on the masses, unite and transform technical personnel, and give play to organizational forces to gradually solve problems in a planned way. Instead, they only circle around a specific technical problem, leading "solo efforts" and grabbing at everything, which often results in the factory director only being able to play the role of a workshop director or technician. Obviously, this cannot solve the problem.
    When improving technical management this year, the party organizations of each factory examined and exposed these erroneous ideological styles. Combined with studying relevant documents, they conducted investigations and research on the production situation for about 20 days. Through these analyses and studies, it was found that one of the main reasons for the chaotic production order and failure to complete tasks was the backwardness of technical management: there were no strict product quality standards, and there was no set of correct technical regulations, operating procedures, and responsibility systems formulated accordingly; or although there were some feasible regulations and systems, they could not be well implemented because they were not conscientiously mobilized among the masses and strictly inspected. This inevitably led to chaotic management order, increased waste products, continuous accidents, rampant rework, and production tasks becoming increasingly numerous, which inevitably led to a situation of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end, passive leadership, and complaints from the masses. After analysis, the leading cadres became clear-headed and gained a sense of certainty. They realized that only by replacing backward handicraft management methods with scientific management methods can they adapt to the requirements of production. These changes in leadership thinking provided a prerequisite for the smooth improvement of technical management.
    Second, implement the Party's policy of uniting and transforming technical personnel, and give play to the positive role of technical personnel. This is the central link in strengthening technical management.
    In the past, there were shortcomings in the implementation of the Party's policy of uniting and transforming technical personnel in various factories in Taiyuan City. For example, political and ideological education for technical personnel was neglected, their opinions were not listened to patiently, their expertise was not utilized, and they were often used as general cadres, which prevented them from effectively playing their role in technical positions. Among the masses, especially among some old technical workers, there was a tendency not to respect technical personnel. In improving technical management, the party organizations of each factory first criticized the shortcomings in the work of uniting and transforming technical personnel from the perspective of leadership thinking, and educated the masses to eliminate the estrangement between them and technical personnel. The party organizations also mobilized and educated technical personnel. The party organizations focused on relying on the backbone of technical personnel, criticizing their "routine" work attitude of not being responsible, their subjective ideological methods of being ambitious and divorced from reality, and their erroneous views of not being interested in politics and looking down on workers' rationalization proposals, as well as their sectarian emotions of mutual prejudice and disunity. After criticism and self-criticism, and by using waste product exhibitions, good and bad comparisons, charts, cartoons, and physical experiments to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization, all employees further recognized the necessity of technical management and the necessity of combining technical personnel with workers. At the same time, cadres were mobilized to support technical personnel, help them combine with workers, make achievements in production, and consciously cultivate models from among technical personnel. The party organizations not only encouraged them in many ways, but also urged the administrative departments to give them clear responsibilities. After these efforts, technical personnel underwent great changes. A technician in a certain factory went deep into the workshop, explained the principles of the machines to the workers, and helped the workers solve technical operation problems. The workers reflected, "Technical personnel are different from the past." Technical personnel also felt that it was easier to work in the workshop. One technician in a workshop used to think that the leadership did not trust him, but now he actively goes deep into the workshop and, in conjunction with the workers, successfully experimented with ductile iron.
    Third, fight against the phenomenon of technical irresponsibility and violations of operating procedures to ensure that the revision of rules and regulations is combined with supervision and implementation.
    After the above-mentioned ideological mobilization, the factories and mines organized engineering and technical personnel and workers to review and formulate technical regulations and operating procedures based on product performance and specification standards, and establish and improve relevant responsibility systems. The party organizations of each factory and mine launched a struggle against the phenomenon of non-compliance with regulations and systems and technical irresponsibility among the masses. In the past, employees generally did not pay attention to various regulations. Most of the original regulations were not practical, and even if there were some feasible regulations, they were reduced to formalism due to the lack of a supervisory and enforcement inspection system. After product changes, they could not be revised in a timely manner, or the technical personnel would sit in the office and formulate a few rules based on subjective assumptions, which made it impossible to establish sound technical responsibility systems and operating procedures. The workers said, "Written on paper, posted on the wall, it's useless." As a result, it was difficult to ensure safe production and product quality. In response to this situation, the party organization and administration, together with the trade union, first mobilized the masses for self-education, inspected and exposed the bad consequences caused by the lack of or non-implementation of regulations and systems, and criticized the erroneous thinking of not complying with operating procedures and the subjectivist style in formulating operating procedures. Then, the technical personnel and workers were mobilized to combine and proceed from reality, prioritizing the urgency of different issues, and used the Kovalev method to review and revise various rules and regulations. For example, the No. 4 Power Plant used this method to establish 15 operating procedures and revise 25 rules and regulations. The heat treatment workshop of a certain factory, in response to key problems, established 25 operating procedures based on the suggestions of Soviet experts. As a result of the continuous struggle against non-compliance with rules and regulations and lax labor discipline among the employees, the revision of rules and regulations was combined with supervision and implementation, which greatly reduced waste products and accidents. The scrap rate of the JinGong workshop of Shanxi Machine Factory decreased from 3.27 percent in July to 0.55 percent in August. The production workshop of Power Plant No. 4 did not experience any accidents from July 11 to mid-October.
    Fourth, further improve the relationship between inspectors and workers, and improve the inspection system.
    The phenomenon of opposition between inspectors and workers is common in factories in Taiyuan City. This problem seriously affects product quality. Although there has been some improvement after the quality inspection last year, the problem is still very serious. Inspectors put the supervision of product quality in opposition to serving production, turning inspection work into a passive "gatekeeping". Some workers lack a correct understanding of the inspection system, regarding inspection as "passing the barrier". Sometimes, they even resort to deception to deceive the inspectors, or use the negative idea of "slow work produces fine work" to deal with "passing the barrier," which affects the improvement of labor productivity. Some inspectors do not care about production or are not familiar with the production process, but simply passively "gatekeep," easily rejecting or scrapping products, and sometimes even turning good products into waste products. Unreasonable inspection processes also cause great waste. Sometimes, products that are actually waste from the first few processes are not discovered until the last process.
    In response to the above problems, the party organizations of each factory carried out education on being responsible to the country and prioritizing quality among the employees, and through criticism and self-criticism, criticized the workers' erroneous attitude of not respecting the responsibilities of the inspectors. Among the inspectors, the unified view of supervising product quality and serving production was established. After these steps, the awareness of workers and inspectors was raised, and the system was improved. Inspectors no longer use a passive "gatekeeping" attitude to conduct inspections. In inspections, they can make positive suggestions on quality and help workers analyze product defects and causes. Workers have changed from "passing the barrier" to "finding the barrier," actively seeking the opinions of inspectors on product quality, accepting lessons, and continuously improving technology and product quality. On this basis, the factories have successively established and improved various inspection systems, such as the three-level inspection system, the first-piece approval system, and the waste product analysis system.
    Fifth, launch work competitions in departments and offices, establish a responsibility system, and further orient the work of departments and offices towards production.
    In strengthening technical management, it is also necessary to correspondingly launch and organize competitions among department and office personnel, further establish and improve the responsibility system of departments and offices, and establish the view that departments and offices serve production, so that the implementation of rules and regulations can be guaranteed. Old cadres in departments and offices are generally not proficient in their work, young intellectuals lack practical knowledge of production, newly promoted workers are limited by their educational level and organizational ability, and the phenomenon of factory staff continuing the "routine" of dealing with leadership inherited from the past is still very serious, lacking the concept of serving production for the workshop. At the same time, due to the "all-encompassing" leadership style in the past, the Party's leadership and supervision over the work of departments and offices has also been very weak.
    Therefore, in this improvement of technical management, the factories and mines first adopted the method of "department and office visits" (each department and office invited personnel related to the workshop and themselves, as well as veteran workers, to give opinions face-to-face) to expose the shortcomings of the work of departments and offices, find key problems, and identify the direction of future efforts. After discussion, the department and office staff initially realized that the work should serve workshop production and should play the role of assistant to the factory director well. Based on this spirit, they formulated practical work plans and responsibility systems to rectify the work of the departments and offices.
    Secondly, the factories and mines reorganized the grassroots organizations of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League according to the different nature of the work of the departments and offices, so that political work was closely integrated with the business of the departments and offices, and the Party's leadership and supervision over the work of the departments and offices was strengthened.
    Thirdly, competitions of the same type of work were launched in the departments and offices. Through the competitions, the work of the departments and offices was further promoted to be oriented towards production.

    太原市厂矿党组织在改进技术管理中的政治思想工作
    中共太原市委书记　王大任
    太原市国营、地方国营厂矿，去年秋季曾进行过一次质量检查，在全体职工中树立了重视质量的观念，提高了产品质量。但由于当时只着重地解决思想问题，未能在各种规程和制度方面加以贯彻与巩固，加上随着国家有计划的经济建设的开展，各厂矿更需要注意安全生产问题，产品质量要求更加严格，并要求不断生产新产品。在这种情况下，就更加感到技术管理工作不能适应新的需要。在电厂和机器制造厂中，这种情况特别严重。在这些单位中常常是事故频繁、严重报废、恶性返修，生产秩序极度混乱，连续地完不成生产任务。太原第二和第四两个电厂今年一至六月份，发生事故达一百零九次，少送电一万二千七百五十五度。有一个工厂五月份仅完成月计划的百分之三点二；在四十四种产品零件中，质量事故即达一一六个，返修率竟达百分之一千三百。各厂矿的机器设备维护检修工作也做得很差。有一个工厂四月份机修工时达二千零九十四小时，某一机器坏了修，修了又坏，一个月内竟连续修了九次，停工达二百七十三小时。
    因此，从四月份以来，在讨论今年国家计划的基础上，我们根据各该企业上级主管部门所规定的方针，结合各厂矿的实际情况，在加强计划管理的过程中，改进了技术管理工作。这一工作的效果很好，四个月来，不仅提高了产品质量，而且由于返修浪费和事故的减少，生产效率亦大为提高。如以三个机器厂一至五月份的商品总值共为一百计，则六、七两月份提高到一三四点三九至六四二点五。在产品质量方面，某厂某工序合格率由五月份的百分之七十二，上升为七月份的百分之九十二点九。另一工序的一级品由五月份的百分之五点三，上升为七月份的百分之百。某一工序不合格率调整率五月份为百分之四十四，七月份降为零。
    在改进技术管理工作中各厂的党组织都从以下几个方面加强了政治思想工作。
    第一、大力转变经验主义的领导方法，提倡调查研究、学习与掌握新的业务知识，改进技术管理。
    太原市不少厂矿的领导干部的领导思想和领导方法长时期存在着严重的保守倾向和经验主义。他们满足于过去的成就，对于当前产品质量的精密要求与现有技术水平和技术设备尤其是技术管理的落后状况的矛盾，认识不足。对待生产中的技术问题，他们不是抓住从改进技术管理这一基本环节入手，依靠群众、团结改造技术人员、发挥组织力量有计划地逐步解决问题，而只是在某项具体的技术问题上打圈子，领导“单干”，到处乱抓，结果往往是厂长只能起到车间主任或技术员的作用。这样，显然是不能解决问题的。
    今年改进技术管理时，各厂党组织检查和揭发了这些错误的思想作风，结合学习有关文件，对生产情况进行了二十天左右的调查研究。经过这些分析研究，发现生产秩序混乱和完不成任务的主要原因之一是由于技术管理工作落后：既没有严格的产品质量标准，又没有依此制定的一套正确的技术规程、操作规程和责任制度；或者虽有部分可行的规程制度，因为没有认真发动群众去执行和严格检查，也都不能很好贯彻，这就必然形成管理秩序混乱、废品增多、事故不断、恶性返修，生产任务越拉越多，便不得不陷于前松后紧、领导被动和群众埋怨的局面。经过分析以后，领导干部头脑清醒了，心中有了底。认识到只有以科学的管理方法代替落后的手工业的管理方法，才能适应生产的要求。领导思想上的这些转变，给顺利地改进技术管理，提供了先决条件。
    第二、贯彻党对技术人员的团结和改造政策，发挥技术人员的积极作用。这是加强技术管理的中心环节。
    过去，太原市各厂贯彻党对技术人员的团结改造政策是有缺点的，比如忽视对技术人员的政治思想教育，不耐心倾听技术人员的意见，不发挥他们的专长，而往往把他们当作一般干部使用，致使他们不能在技术岗位上有效地发挥作用；在群众中特别是部分老技术工人中存在着不尊重技术人员的倾向。在改进技术管理中，各厂党组织首先从领导思想上批判了团结和改造技术人员工作中的缺点，并教育群众，消除他们和技术人员之间的隔阂。党组织对技术人员也进行了发动和教育。各厂党组织着重依靠技术人员中的骨干，批判了他们责任心不强的“例行公事”工作态度，批判了他们好高骛远、脱离实际的主观主义的思想方法和不问政治、看不起工人合理化建议的错误观点，以及他们相互间的门户之见、闹不团结等宗派情绪。经过批评和自我批评，并运用废品展览、好坏对比、图表、漫画、实物试验等方式进行了广泛深入的宣传鼓动，使全体职工进一步认识了技术管理的必要和技术人员与工人相结合的必要。同时，动员干部支持技术人员，帮助他们和工人结合，在生产上作出成绩，有意识地从技术人员中培养模范。党组织不但从多方面鼓励他们，并督促行政方面给他们以明确的责任。经过这些工作，技术人员有了很大转变。某厂一技师深入车间，给工人讲解机器原理，帮助工人解决技术操作上的问题。工人反映：“技术人员和过去不一样了”。技术人员也觉得到车间好做工作了。一车间有一个技术员过去认为领导上不信任他，现在积极深入车间，并与工人结合试验成功了球墨铸铁。
    第三、和技术上的无人负责以及违反操作规程现象进行斗争，保证把修订规程制度和监督执行结合起来。
    经过上述思想发动之后，各厂矿组织工程技术人员与工人，根据产品性能和规格标准审查与制订技术规程和操作规程，建立与健全有关的责任制度。各厂矿的党组织则对群众中的不遵守规程制度以及技术问题方面的无人负责现象展开斗争。过去，职工群众对于各项规程都极不重视。原有的规程多不切合实际，即使有一些可行的规程，也因缺乏监督执行的检查制度而流于形式主义。产品变更后，更不能作到及时修订规程，或者是技术人员坐在办公室单凭主观臆断拟定几条，致使技术责任制度和操作规程始终未能健全起来。工人说：“写在纸上，贴在墙上，啥事不顶”。结果很难保证安全生产和产品质量。针对此种情况，党组织和行政、工会首先发动群众进行自我教育，检查揭发了过去因缺乏或不执行规程制度所造成的恶果，批判了不遵守操作规程的错误思想和制订操作规程中的主观主义作风。而后，发动技术人员与工人相结合，分别轻重缓急，从实际出发，运用郭瓦廖夫工作法，审查与修订了各项规程和制度。如发电四厂采用这种办法建立了十五种操作规程，并修订了二十五种规程制度。某厂热处理车间针对关键问题，根据苏联专家建议，建立了二十五种操作规程。由于在职工中不断地与不按规程制度办事和劳动纪律松弛现象斗争的结果，使规程制度的修订和监督执行结合了起来，大大减少了废品和事故。山西机器厂金工车间报废率由七月份的百分之三点二七降为八月份的百分之零点五五。发电四厂生产车间从七月十一日至十月中都没有发生过事故。
    第四、进一步改善检验人员与工人的关系，健全检验制度。
    太原市各厂普遍存在着检验人员与工人对立的现象。这个问题严重地影响着产品质量。去年质量检查后虽有所改善，但问题仍很严重。检验人员们把监督产品质量和为生产服务对立起来，把检验工作弄成消极的“把关”，有些工人对检验制度缺乏正确的认识，把检验当成“过关”，有时，甚至采取欺骗办法去瞒哄检验人员，或者用“慢工出细活”的消极思想，去对待“过关”，影响了劳动生产率的提高。有些检验人员不关心生产、不熟悉生产过程，只是消极的“把关”，轻易地把产品退修、报废，有时甚至使良品变成废品。检验工序不合理也造成很大的浪费，有时，本来是前几道工序中的废品，却直到最后一道工序才发现出来。
    针对以上问题，各厂党组织在职工中进行了对国家负责和质量第一的教育，并通过批评和自我批评，批判了工人中不尊重检验人员职责的错误态度；在检验人员中则树立了监督产品质量和为生产服务的统一观点。经过这些步骤，提高了工人和检验人员的觉悟，并改进了制度。检验人员不再用消极的“把关”态度来进行检验，在检验中能够对质量提出积极的建议，帮助工人分析产品的毛病和原因。工人则变“过关”为“找关”，主动地找检验人员征询产品质量的意见，接受经验教训，不断改进技术，提高产品质量。在这个基础上，各厂相继建立和健全了各种检验制度，比如三级检验制、第一个活的批准制和废品分析制等。
    第五、发动科、室工作竞赛，建立责任制度，使科室工作进一步面向生产。
    在加强技术管理中，还必须相应地发动和组织科室人员的竞赛，进一步建立和健全科室的责任制度，确立科室为生产服务的观点，规程制度的贯彻才有保证。科室中老干部一般业务不熟，青年知识分子缺乏生产的实际知识，新提拔的工人受文化水平与组织能力的限制，工厂原来的职员因袭下来的“例行公事”应付领导的现象还很严重，缺乏面向车间为生产服务的观念。同时由于过去“一揽子”的领导作风，党对科室工作的领导与监督，也是非常薄弱的。
    因此，在这次改进技术管理中：各厂矿首先采取“科室拜访”（各科室邀请车间和本身有关的人员以及老工人当面提意见）的办法，揭发了科室工作的缺点，找出关键问题及今后努力的方向。科室工作人员经过讨论，初步认识到工作应该为车间生产服务，应该很好地发挥厂长助手作用，根据这一精神制订了切合实际的工作方案与责任制度，把科室工作加以整顿。
    其次，各厂矿依据科室工作的不同性质，重新调整了党、工会和青年团的基层组织，使政治工作密切地和科室业务结合起来，加强了党对科室工作的领导和监督。
    再次，在科室中展开了同工种的竞赛，通过竞赛进一步推动科室工作面向生产。
