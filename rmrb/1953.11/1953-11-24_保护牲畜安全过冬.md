    Protecting Livestock for Safe Wintering
    Currently, China's animal husbandry production relies on natural pastures for grazing, making it heavily influenced by natural conditions. Livestock tend to gain weight during the summer and autumn seasons; however, during the winter and spring, due to the cold weather, heavy snow, and lack of fodder, livestock are prone to losses. Therefore, before the arrival of the cold winter, it is important work in animal husbandry production to prepare for livestock to safely pass through the winter and spring, and to protect them through the cold season.
    The Inner Mongolia Daily has been paying attention to the publicity of livestock safety during the winter and spring since late August. On August 26th and October 3rd, the newspaper successively published Chairman Ulanhu of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government's telegram calling on herdsmen to take immediate action to prepare for livestock to pass the winter and spring safely, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government's instructions on winter preparation in pastoral areas. On September 12th, the newspaper emphasized in the article "Seize the Opportunity to Prepare for Winter and Spring": "Doing a good job in preparing for winter and spring in order to overcome winter and spring snow disasters should be the central task overriding everything else in pastoral areas." From September 18th, the newspaper opened a special column "Seize the Opportunity to Prepare Livestock for Winter and Spring," and published eight consecutive articles. In addition to criticizing some cadres for not paying attention to the preparation of livestock for winter and spring, it also systematically introduced how to do a good job in preparing livestock for winter and spring based on the past experience and lessons of herdsmen in protecting livestock through the winter, using practical examples and methods of good and bad comparisons. The column promoted: organizing herdsmen to go on "Aoter" (long-distance transhumance grazing) to help livestock gain autumn fat, which is an important prerequisite for ensuring that livestock can safely survive the winter and spring; comprehensively surveying and adjusting pastures to achieve rational use, prioritizing the use of pastures that cannot be used in winter due to heavy snowfall during the summer and autumn seasons, and reserving pastures with terrain conducive to preventing wind and snow for winter and spring use; building sheds and preparing sufficient fodder to preserve the autumn fat of livestock and avoid them from freezing, starving, aborting, and dying in winter and spring snow disasters. The column also raised the issue of organizing for the winter. The newspaper pointed out that the labor force of general herding households in pastoral areas is very small. Only by organizing and giving play to the collective strength can the difficulty of insufficient labor in the work of protecting livestock during the winter be overcome. The newspaper also used specific examples to illustrate the benefits of mutual cooperation. For example, the herder Qi Benge in Xinba Left Banner only had two laborers. During this spring's blizzard disaster, he had to take care of both the cattle and the sheep. Because he couldn't manage, ninety-four of the three hundred sheep died; while the herder Ao Han and others in Arukorqin Banner organized a mutual aid group for animal husbandry production. With sufficient manpower, they effectively resisted the blizzard. The breeding rate of 173 various female animals and the survival rate of young animals in the whole group reached 100%.
    According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, leading cadres at all levels in Inner Mongolia are actively leading herdsmen to prepare livestock for winter and spring. For example, the Xianghuang Banner in Shangdu, Huna League, and Chahar League, etc., have successively held people's representative conferences, banner and zuo-chang meetings, etc., to specifically discuss and deploy the issue of livestock wintering and spring. Comrade Dugurzhabu, Secretary of the Xilingol League Committee of the Communist Party of China, also personally inspected and promoted work in pastoral areas. Herdsmen in various places have also generally taken action. In addition to moving to different pastures to gain autumn fat, herdsmen in various banners of the Chahar League have already prepared 2.8 million jin of grass. The 124 laborers of Hao Xiaomao Daogaqi in Arukorqin Banner formed eleven grass-cutting mutual aid groups and started cutting grass on August 17th. By September 4th, they had cut 3.29 million jin, averaging 598 jin of grass stored for each livestock, exceeding the grass-cutting task.
    The cold winter has arrived. Timely mobilizing and educating cadres and the broad masses of herdsmen in pastoral areas to prepare livestock for winter and spring in order to overcome natural disasters such as wind and snow in winter and spring should arouse the attention of all newspapers in pastoral and semi-pastoral areas.

### 保护牲畜安全过冬

    保护牲畜安全过冬
    目前我国的畜牧业生产由于依靠自然牧场牧放，受自然条件的影响较大。夏秋两季，牲畜容易肥胖；可是一到冬季春季，天寒多雪，草料缺乏，牲畜就容易遭到损失。因此，在寒冬未来前，做好牲畜过冬过春准备工作，保护牲畜安全度过寒冷季节，是畜牧业生产上的重要工作。
    内蒙古日报从八月下旬起即注意了牲畜安全过冬过春的宣传。八月二十六日、十月三日报纸先后发表了内蒙古自治区人民政府乌兰夫主席号召牧民立即行动起来，作好牲畜过冬过春准备工作的电文和内蒙古自治区人民政府关于牧区过冬准备工作的指示。九月十二日该报在“抓紧时机做好过冬过春准备工作”一文中强调指出：“做好过冬过春准备工作，以争取战胜冬春季风雪灾害，应该是当前牧区压倒一切的中心工作任务。”九月十八日起报纸辟了“抓紧做好牲畜过冬过春准备工作”的专栏，连续发表八篇文章，除批判了有些干部不重视牲畜过冬过春的准备工作外，还根据过去牧民保护牲畜过冬的经验教训，运用实际例子，以好坏对比的方法，对如何做好牲畜过冬过春准备工作，作了比较系统的介绍。专栏中宣传了：组织牧民走“敖特尔”
  （远道移场放牧）使牲畜抓上秋膘，是使牲畜安全度过冬春的一个重要前提；要全面勘查和调剂好牧场，做到合理使用，把冬季因降雪量大而不能利用的牧场，尽先在夏秋两季用，把地势有利于防止风雪的牧场，则留到冬春时用；要搭盖棚圈和准备充足草料，以保住牲畜的秋膘，避免牲畜冻饿、流产和在冬春风雪灾害中死亡。专栏中还提出组织起来过冬的问题。报纸指出，牧区一般牧户的劳动力都很少，只要组织起来，发挥集体力量，就可以克服在保护牲畜过冬工作中劳动力不够的困难。报纸并用具体例子说明互助合作的好处，如新巴左旗牧民其本格家里只有两个劳动力，在今春暴风雪灾害中，又要照顾牛群，又要照顾羊群，因为顾不过来，致使三百只羊中死了九十四只；而阿鲁科尔沁旗牧民奥汗等，组织了牧业生产互助组，人力充足，有力地抗过了暴风雪的袭击，全组一百七十三头各种母畜的繁殖率和幼畜的成活率都达到了百分之百。
    据内蒙古日报报道，内蒙古各地各级领导干部正积极领导牧民进行牲畜过冬过春的准备工作。如商都厢黄旗、呼纳盟、察哈尔盟等人民政府都先后召开了旗各界人民代表会议，旗、佐长会议等，专门讨论和布置了牲畜过冬过春问题。中共锡林郭勒盟盟委书记都固尔扎布同志并亲自到牧区视察和推动工作。各地牧民也普遍行动起来。察哈尔盟各旗牧民除了走场抓秋膘外，全盟已打好二百八十万斤草。阿鲁科尔沁旗好小毛道嘎查的一百二十四名劳力，组成十一个打草互助组，从八月十七日起就开始打草，到九月四日已打了三百二十九万斤，替每头牲畜平均储了五百九十八斤草，超额完成了打草任务。
    寒冬已经来临。及时动员和教育牧区干部及广大牧民做好牲畜过冬过春准备工作，以战胜冬春两季的风雪等自然灾害，应该引起所有牧区和半牧区报纸的重视。
