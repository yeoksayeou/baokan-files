Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 21st: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published on October 30th the responses of Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, to questions posed by the French bourgeois weekly "l'Observateur," in which he discussed the struggle of the French working class and all the people for national independence and peace.

When discussing the characteristics of the French people's struggle in 1953 compared to 1936, Thorez said: "In the 1934 period, the main feature of social life was: after the economic crisis, the political situation deteriorated, and the working class victoriously crushed the fascist conspiracy of February 1934, thus strengthening united action in the struggle. The political struggle against the reactionaries was closely combined with the subsequent economic struggle against government decrees, against the impoverishment of workers, office workers, veterans, farmers, and other strata of the people. Therefore, the struggle that led to the victory of the Popular Front and the people's victory over the Two Hundred Families was essentially social in content...

"Due to the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact, France is currently experiencing many disasters, which are: economic decline, public financial chaos, poverty, unemployment, the extremely difficult situation of urban and rural workers, the use of fascist methods, the intensification of the enslavement of colonial peoples, the policy of war, and the rearmament of Germany.

"This is why this broad struggle tends to absorb various workers, as well as people from other strata, that is, all French people who are willing to strive for the restoration of our national independence and sovereignty.

"Therefore, the issue of national independence and peace is the central issue for the future. United action and the action of all national and democratic forces are the decisive issues at present, and the unity of the working class is a prerequisite for this great union of forces."

Regarding the Communist Party's attitude toward the government, Thorez said: At the meeting of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party on October 23rd, I said, "Nothing is more important or more urgent than uniting all honest French people to tear up the Bonn and Paris treaties." The resolution passed at this meeting shows that our party is determined to spare no effort to prevent these treaties from being ratified at home and in parliament; the Communists are prepared to unite with all those who are willing to abolish these disastrous treaties.

We also believe that a policy in line with French interests should require negotiations with President Ho Chi Minh to end the war in Indochina.

As for economic demands, all workers have begun to recognize the clear relationship between their difficulties and the Atlantic war policy.

The Communists are determined to support any policy that takes these three types of facts into account.

In response to the question of whether the French Communist Party suggested that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party take united action, Thorez pointed out: The Socialist Party and its parliamentary group rejected the recent proposal of the French Communist Party to take united action. But he said: The Communists will do their utmost to develop united action between Socialist and Communist workers throughout the country.

In response to another question about whether the Communist Party intends to approach all groups, factions, and individuals who take a stand against the "European Defense Community," Thorez said: "We are determined to unite with all French people who oppose the Bonn and Paris treaties, no matter who they are; we are determined to take united action with them in all occasions of domestic and parliamentary life to stop these treaties that cause war and enslavement."

    多列士谈法国人民现阶段争取和平的斗争
    法共决团结全国人民反对波恩与巴黎条约
    【新华社柏林二十一日电】法国“人道报”在十月三十日刊载了法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士对法国资产阶级周刊“观察家”所提问题的答复，其中谈到法国工人阶级与全体人民目前争取民族独立与和平的斗争。
    在谈到法国人民斗争在一九五三年和一九三六年时的形势的特点时，多列士说：“在一九三四年时期中，社会生活的主要特色是：在经济危机后，政治形势恶化，工人阶级胜利地粉碎了一九三四年二月的法西斯阴谋，就这样，在斗争中加强了一致行动。对反动派进行的政治斗争与接着对政府法令、对损害工人、职员、退伍军人、农民与其它阶层人民的贫困进行的经济斗争密切地结合起来。所以使人民阵线得到胜利、使人民取得对二百家的胜利的斗争，在本质上是有社会内容的……
    “由于马歇尔计划与大西洋公约，法国目前正遭遇到许多灾害，这些灾害是：经济衰落、公共财政混乱、贫困、失业、城乡工人境况十分艰难、法西斯手段的使用、对殖民地人民奴役的加紧、战争政策与德国的重新武装。
    “这就是这个广大的斗争有把各种工人、同时也把其它阶层的人民，也就是说所有愿意争取恢复我们的民族独立与主权的法国人民吸收进来的倾向的原因。
    “因此，民族独立与和平问题是今后的中心问题。一致行动与所有民族的、民主的力量的行动是目前的决定性问题，工人阶级的团结是这种力量的大联合的先决条件。”
    关于共产党对政府的态度，多列士说：在法国共产党中央委员会十月二十三日的会议上，我说过，“没有比团结一切正直的法国人来撕毁波恩与巴黎条约更为重要、更为迫切的了。”在这次会议上所通过的决议表明，我们的党决定不遗余力地在国内与议会阻止这些条约得到批准；共产党人准备与所有愿意废除这些祸国殃民的条约的人们团结起来。
    我们还认为一个符合法国利益的政策应该要求与胡志明主席谈判，以结束印度支那战争。
    至于经济要求，所有工人已开始认识到他们的困难与大西洋战争政策之间的明显的关系。
    共产党人决定支持任何考虑到这三类事实的政策。
    在回答法国共产党建议社会党和共产党采取一致行动的问题时，多列士指出：社会党及其议会党团拒绝了法国共产党最近提出的采取一致行动的建议。但是他说：共产党人将尽最大力量来发展全国各地社会党与共产党工人的一致行动。
    在回答另外一个关于共产党是否有意接近一切采取反对“欧洲防务集团”的态度的集团、派别与人士的问题时，多列士说：“我们决心与所有反对波恩与巴黎条约的法国人联合起来，不论他们是谁；我们决心与他们在国内以及议会生活的所有场合采取一致行动，来制止这些造成战争与奴役的条约。”
