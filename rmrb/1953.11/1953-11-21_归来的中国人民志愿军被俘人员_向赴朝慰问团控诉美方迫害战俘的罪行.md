Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 20th: Returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Kaesong, on the 18th and 19th, separately accused the U.S. imperialists of persecuting and slaughtering prisoners of war and sabotaging the explanation work to the representatives of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, the first general sub-delegation, and the members of the cultural troupe.

　　Returned prisoner of war Zhang Zeshi said excitedly: "For the past two or three years, we have been thinking of the motherland day and night. Today, seeing the relatives from the motherland, how can I not be excited?" Then, with tears in his eyes, he reported the process of the illegal "screening" and massacre of prisoners of war by the U.S. side on Geoje Island in April 1952. During this bloody "screening," the U.S. military authorities used the most brutal means to forcibly send more than 10,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war into prisoner-of-war camps for non-direct repatriation.

　　Returned prisoner of war Guo Zhaolie reported the "March Massacre" that occurred in the non-direct repatriation prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island in 1953. This was a bloody massacre carried out by U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to suppress the prisoners of war's desire to return to their country and strengthen their reign of terror.

　　The murder of Zhang Zilong, which fully demonstrated the brutality of U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, was comprehensively reported by Zhang Zeshi. He said that Zhang Zilong was nailed in the head with a large nail, and flesh was cut off his arm, but he still shouted: "Resolutely return to the country." At this time, many representatives' eyes were filled with tears.

　　Returned personnel Lu Kai, Chen Xinglong, Ruan Qing, Zhang Yongbin, and old fisherman Sun Caisheng, who were in the same camp as Zhang Zilong, witnessed how the U.S.-Chiang secret agents dug out Zhang Zilong's heart and burned his body. They also condemned the act with grief and indignation.

　　Finally, Lao She, the deputy head of the delegation, said: We are very angry after listening to the report of the returned comrades, and we will also accuse the world as they do. The prisoners of war under the persecution of the enemy are tenacious and unyielding, and they expressed that they would return to the motherland even if they died. The people of the motherland will support the struggle of the prisoners of war to exercise their right to be repatriated.

     归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员
     向赴朝慰问团控诉美方迫害战俘的罪行
     【新华社开城二十日电】在开城的归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，在十八、十九两日，分别向中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团总团、第一总分团代表和文工团团员，控诉了美帝国主义迫害、屠杀战俘和破坏解释工作的罪行。
    归来的被俘人员张泽石激动地说：“二、三年来，我们日夜想念着祖国，今天看到了从祖国来的亲人，我怎能不激动呢？”接着，他含着眼泪报告了一九五二年四月美方在巨济岛进行非法“甄别”及屠杀战俘的经过。在这次血腥“甄别”中，美军当局用最残暴的手段强迫把一万多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员送入不直接遣返的战俘营。
    归来的被俘人员郭兆烈报告了一九五三年在济州岛不直接遣返的战俘营中发生的“三月惨案”，这是美帝国主义和蒋匪特务为镇压战俘回国愿望和加强恐怖统治的一次血腥屠杀。
    充分表现出美帝国主义和蒋匪特务凶残的张子龙被谋杀事件，由张泽石作了综合报告。他说到，张子龙头上被钉上了一支大洋钉，臂膀上被割掉了肉，还是高喊：“坚决要回国”。这时，许多代表的眼眶充满了泪水。
    和张子龙同一营场的归来人员卢凯、陈兴隆、阮清、张永斌和老渔民孙才生，他们亲眼看见美蒋特务如何把张子龙的心挖了，尸烧了，他们也悲愤地进行了控诉。
    最后，慰问团副总团长老舍说：我们听了归来同志的报告非常愤恨，我们也要和他们一样地向世界控诉。在敌人迫害下的被俘人员是顽强不屈的，他们表示死也要回到祖国来。祖国人民将支持被俘人员为行使自己被遣返权利的斗争。
