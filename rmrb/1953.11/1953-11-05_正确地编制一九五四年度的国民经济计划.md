    Correctly Compile the 1954 National Economic Plan
    Beginning in mid-October, various regions, departments, and grassroots planning units have been drafting the 1954 national economic plan based on the control figures issued by the state and higher authorities. The national plan is the guiding principle for our national economic activities. It guides various economic activities to develop in a planned and proportionate manner, closely integrated with each other, and in line with the Party and the state's general line and specific policies, advancing along the socialist road. Therefore, correctly compiling the 1954 national economic plan is of extremely important significance for the correct conduct of various economic activities next year and the smooth development of the Five-Year Plan.
    The 1954 national economic plan must take the Party and the state's main tasks in 1954 as its fundamental starting point. Based on our country's general line and general policy during the transition period, the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, and based on the review and forecast of the implementation of the 1953 national economic plan, the 1954 national economic plan has the following main tasks, which are also some specific policies of the Party and the state in economic construction.
    First, continuously increasing the proportion of the socialist economy and concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry is our country's unwavering policy for developing the national economy. In 1954, on the basis of the already launched, large-scale capital construction this year, we should further concentrate our efforts on the construction of heavy industry and railway construction, and make every effort to ensure the completion of the continuing projects, the projects starting construction, and the projects providing basic design data and determining design task books in the projects designed with Soviet assistance, according to plan. Because these enterprises are the material basis that plays a decisive role in our country's socialist industrialization, guarantees our country's economic independence and national defense security, strengthens the leading role of our country's socialist economic components, continuously elevates our country's economy, and continuously improves the people's lives.
    In order to concentrate the state's financial and human resources to ensure the completion of the above-mentioned major projects, capital construction in 1954 must continue to oppose and prevent the tendency of greed for quick success, doing everything at once. To achieve this, we must realistically study the possible conditions of resources, design, equipment, materials, especially technical forces and funds, repeatedly calculate and balance, postpone and reduce those things that can be postponed or can be avoided, and effectively implement the Party and the state's policy of focusing on key construction projects.
    While concentrating efforts on heavy industry construction, we must appropriately pay attention to light industry construction, especially the textile industry, to gradually meet the people's growing needs for daily necessities. Due attention must also be given to the construction of enterprises that can quickly realize investment results and increase industrial production capacity.
    Second, in order to ensure the speed of industrial development and meet the needs of national construction and the people in production and life as much as possible, we should, based on the situation of supply, production, and sales, and based on needs and possibilities, give full play to the equipment efficiency of state-owned industry; at the same time, promote the initiative of local areas and give full play to the equipment efficiency of local state-owned industry, especially its light industry; for private industry, we should also appropriately give play to its initiative, develop the parts that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and carry out socialist transformation in a planned way. We must effectively promote various handicraft productions that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and promote the development of handicraft cooperatives in accordance with the principle of voluntariness.
    In order to fully utilize the potential capacity of existing enterprises and ensure the speed of industrial development, it is necessary to continue to oppose the conservative tendency in industrial production plans. Some departments or enterprises adopt backward quotas, emphasize the impact of unfavorable factors and weak links, ignore and do not strive to utilize favorable conditions, or do not consider the mutual cooperation of enterprises, but determine production tasks in isolation from the convenience of their own enterprises, and some enterprises even attempt to "hold back," etc., which are all very wrong.
    Industrial production in 1954 should, under the requirements of concretely studying the balance of supply, production, and sales and fully utilizing the potential capacity of industrial and mining enterprises, adjust the existing industrial equipment in a planned way, especially the equipment of the machinery industry and the light industry; improve product design work, increase new varieties and improve specifications; and make the greatest effort to improve product quality and quantity and reduce costs.
    Third, making every effort to increase grain and cotton production is a serious and long-term task for our country's economic development, and we must pay close attention to this in 1954. Grain and cotton are major issues related to the lives of everyone in the country, and at the same time, they have a huge impact on the speed of industrial development, market stability, and other aspects. If insufficient attention is paid to this and leadership is relaxed, it will inevitably produce unfavorable results. Therefore, we must continue to actively and steadily develop and improve the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and provide farmers with practical assistance in terms of water conservancy, fertilizer supply, agricultural loans, improved agricultural technology, improved farm tools, livestock breeding, disaster prevention, and improved tax collection work, in order to increase yield per unit area and improve agricultural productivity. This is of great significance for promoting the common upsurge of industry and agriculture, and for gradually carrying out socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy. In order to achieve the above tasks, the Party's leadership over rural work must be concentrated on increasing grain and cotton production; Party organizations and governments and people's organizations at all levels in agricultural areas must take this as their most important task.
    Fourth, state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial enterprises must expand their turnover, strive to complete the state's procurement plan, do a good job in sales, especially in the supply to rural areas, accelerate capital turnover, reduce circulation costs, and at the same time maintain reasonable reserves of major materials, to meet the material needs of the people and serve economic construction. The practice of some units in the commercial system neglecting the task of turning over profits, not paying attention to saving circulation costs, or only paying attention to procurement and not paying attention to promotion is wrong. In addition, we should resolutely fight against the illegal acts of speculation and arbitrage by some private merchants.
    Fifth, the work of training construction cadres is an important link in whether the country's construction cause can be carried out effectively and smoothly. At the same time, cultural and educational departments should strive to create conditions and train construction talents for the country according to the current and long-term needs of the country, especially technical talents for industrial construction. All enterprises and their management departments must take effective methods to train on-the-job technical personnel, technical workers, and management cadres, and train a certain number of new technical forces. At the same time, we must make the greatest effort to transfer sufficient and suitable cadres to new and expanded factories and mining enterprises in a planned way, strengthen the leadership of basic industrial construction and production; for existing important factories and mining enterprises that are weak in cadres, we should adjust cadres and strengthen leadership in a timely and appropriate manner.
    Sixth, we must accumulate funds from all aspects to support national construction, and we should use funds rationally. The fundamental way to accumulate funds is to vigorously develop production, expand material exchanges, fully utilize potential forces, and increase national income; at the same time, we must practice strict economy, implement economic accounting system, reduce costs, save circulation costs, and increase the profits of state-owned industry and commerce. The finance and taxation departments should strive to complete the tax revenue task and prevent tax evasion.
    The rational use of funds is to ensure economic construction and national defense construction, and to implement the policy of focusing on key construction projects; it is to vigorously reduce all unnecessary expenditures and the expenditure of administrative management fees. The national financial department should effectively control the national budget and supervise the use of funds.
    The improvement of people's lives must also be carried out gradually and conditionally on the basis of production development.
    The above points are the main goals of the national people's struggle in the economic construction in 1954, and we must make our plan conform to these basic requirements.
    To correctly compile the 1954 national economic plan, we must also take correct methods to combine the leadership with the masses. On the one hand, when compiling the plan, grassroots planning units should absorb active elements from the masses (such as the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leaders and advanced model figures in the workshops of enterprises) to participate, draw on the wisdom of the masses, concretely tap potential, overcome weak links, and solve key problems. This will not only make the plan more in line with reality, but also prepare favorable conditions for the realization of the plan. On the other hand, the planning agencies and leading departments of enterprises at all levels should learn and master the basic methods of planning work, that is, the method of balance, concretely study the needs and possibilities, repeatedly carry out balance calculations, discover the problems and seek solutions. In this way, we can avoid blind advancement and conservative tendencies, avoid subjectivism, and make the plan not only play its role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and promoting the continuous advancement of various economic undertakings, but also have accurate and reliable basis, conform to objective practical possibilities, and avoid the phenomenon of mutual disconnection between various economic departments and various economic components.
    While drafting the 1954 national economic plan, all enterprises and their leading departments must make some necessary preparations for the implementation of the 1954 plan, and carry out various preparations in the process of grasping the increase production and economy movement, improving enterprise management, and completing the 1953 plan and the increase production and economy plan. For example, in terms of basic construction, we should seize the necessary resource exploration for next year, arrange the design work as early as possible, determine domestic and foreign equipment orders, prepare building materials, and allocate technical forces and labor, etc.; in terms of industrial production, we should, while drafting the annual plan for next year, compile the quarterly plan for the first quarter of next year, and prepare parts and materials for next year, do a good job in ordering, carry out equipment maintenance, increase necessary technical measures, etc.; in addition, agricultural production, commerce, transportation, etc. must also make some preparations.
    Now there is only more than a month before the draft plan is submitted, the time is extremely tight, and the work is extremely heavy. In addition, we lack experience and the strength of the planning institutions is weak. Therefore, Party committees and governments at all levels must vigorously lead and seize this work, quickly replenish and organize the strength of the planning work, arrange the procedures for the preparation work, give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, absorb the experience and lessons of the preparation of the 1953 plan, conscientiously study and master the Party and the state's principles and policies, repeatedly carry out balance calculations, avoid subjectivism, so that we can compile the 1954 national economic plan in a timely manner and distribute it to the grassroots units on time at the beginning of next year. In the process of planning, we must overcome and prevent the practice of delaying time and acting hastily. It must be pointed out that to prepare a good plan, not only should the planning department go all out, but more importantly, the leading organs of the Party and the government and enterprises at all levels should regard this work as one of the most important tasks at present, which is an important condition for preparing the 1954 national economic plan.

    正确地编制一九五四年度的国民经济计划
    从十月中旬开始，各地区、各部门以及各个基层计划单位都在根据国家和上级机关颁发的控制数字，着手编制一九五四年度的国民经济计划草案。国家的计划是我们国民经济活动的指针，它指导着各种经济活动互相密切结合地有计划地按比例地发展，并使之符合于党和国家的总路线及具体的政策，而沿着社会主义的道路前进。因之，正确地编制一九五四年度的国民经济计划，对明年各种经济活动的正确进行以至五年计划的顺利发展，无疑有着极其重要的意义。
    一九五四年度的国民经济计划，必须以党和国家在一九五四年的主要任务为根本出发点。根据我国在过渡时期的总路线总政策和第一个五年计划的基本任务，以及根据对一九五三年国民经济计划执行情况的检查和预计，一九五四年在国民经济计划方面有如下一些主要任务，这同时就是党和国家在经济建设方面的一些具体方针。
    第一，不断增长社会主义经济比重和集中力量发展重工业，是我国发展国民经济的坚定不移的方针。一九五四年，应在今年已展开的、较大规模的基本建设的基础上，进一步集中力量进行重工业的建设和铁路的建设，尽一切努力将苏联帮助我们设计的基本建设项目中明年续建的工程项目、开始施工的工程项目及提供设计基础资料和确定设计任务书的工程项目，按计划保证完成。因为这些企业乃是对我国社会主义工业化起决定作用的、保证我国经济独立和国防安全、加强我国社会主义经济成分的领导作用、使我国经济不断上升、人民生活不断提高的物质基础。
    为了集中国家的财力和人力保证上述主要工程项目的完成，一九五四年的基本建设必须继续反对和防止那种贪多冒进、百废俱举的倾向。要做到这点，就必须实事求是地研究资源、设计、设备、材料、特别是技术力量和资金的可能条件，反复计算平衡，推迟和削减那些可以推迟或可以不办的事情，有效地贯彻党和国家重点建设的方针。
    在集中力量进行重工业建设时，必须适当地注意轻工业的建设，特别是纺织工业的建设，以逐步满足人民群众日益增长的生活必需品的需要。对于那些能迅速发挥投资效果、增长工业生产能力的企业的建设，也必须给以应有的注意。
    第二，为了保证工业发展的速度，尽可能地满足国家建设和人民群众在生产上、生活上的需要，应根据供、产、销各方面的情况，根据需要与可能，充分发挥国营工业的设备效能；同时发扬地方的积极性，发挥地方国营工业特别是其轻工业的设备效能；对于私营工业，也应适当发挥其积极性，发展其有利于国计民生的部分，并有步骤地对其进行社会主义的改造。必须有效地促进各种有益于国计民生的手工业生产，并按照自愿的原则，推动手工业合作的发展。
    为了充分发挥现有企业的潜在能力，保证工业发展的速度，就有必要继续反对工业生产计划中的保守倾向。有些部门或企业单位采取落后的定额，强调不利因素和薄弱环节的影响，漠视和不去争取、利用有利的条件，或者不从企业的相互配合去考虑，只从本企业方便出发，孤立地确定生产任务，有些企业甚至企图“留一手”等等，都是十分错误的。
    一九五四年的工业生产，应在具体研究供、产、销的平衡和充分发挥工矿企业潜在能力的要求下，有步骤地调整现有的工业设备，特别是机械工业和轻工业的设备；改进产品设计工作，增加新的品种和改进规格；以最大努力提高产品的质量和数量，降低成本。
    第三，尽一切努力增产粮食和棉花，乃是我国发展国民经济长时期的严重任务，一九五四年必须对此十分注意。粮食和棉花是关系着全国每一个人生活的大问题，同时它对工业发展的速度、市场的稳定等各个方面有着十分巨大的影响，如果对此重视不足，放松领导，必将产生不利的结果。因此，必须继续积极地稳步地发展和提高农村互助合作运动，并从兴修水利、供应肥料、发放农贷、改进农业技术、改良农具、繁殖牲畜、防止灾害、改善税收工作等方面给农民以切实的帮助，以增加单位面积产量，提高农业生产力。这对促进工农业的共同高涨，并对小农经济逐步实行社会主义的改造都有很大的意义。为了实现上述任务，党对农村工作的领导，必须集中在增产粮食和棉花方面；农业地区各级党的组织和各级政府及人民团体，必须以此作为自己最重要的任务。
    第四，国营商业和合作社商业，必须扩大营业额，努力完成国家的收购计划，做好销售工作，特别是对农村的供应工作，加速资金周转，降低流转费用，同时保持主要物资的合理储备，以适应人民的物质需要，并为经济建设服务。商业系统某些单位忽视上缴利润任务，不注意节约流转费用，或只顾收购不重视推销的作法，是不对的。此外，对于一部分私商投机套购的不法行为，应坚决与之斗争。
    第五，培养建设干部的工作，是国家建设事业能否有效地顺利进行的一个重要环节。同时，文教部门应根据国家当前和长远的需要，努力创造条件，为国家培养建设人材，特别是工业建设的技术人材。一切企业及其管理部门，必须采取有效的方法，培养在职的技术人员、技术工人及管理干部，并训练出一定数量的新的技术力量。同时，必须以最大的努力，有计划地输送足够的、适宜的干部到新建、扩建的厂矿企业中去，加强工业的基本建设与生产的领导；对于现有重要而又干部薄弱的厂矿企业，应适时地适当地调整干部和加强领导。
    第六，必须从各方面积累资金，支援国家建设，并应合理地使用资金。积累资金的根本办法，就是大力发展生产，扩大物资交流，充分发挥潜在力量，增加国家收入；同时必须厉行节约，贯彻经济核算制，降低成本，节约流转费用，增加国营工商业的利润。财政部门和税收部门应努力完成税收任务，防止偷税漏税。
    合理地使用资金，就是要保证经济建设和国防建设，并贯彻重点建设的方针；就是要大力减缩一切不必要的开支和行政管理费用的开支。国家财政部门应切实掌握国家预算，并监督资金的使用。
    人民生活的改善，也必须在生产发展的基础上逐步地有条件地进行。
    上述各点，是全国人民在一九五四年经济建设方面奋斗的主要目标，必须使我们的计划符合于这些基本的要求。
    要正确地编制一九五四年度的国民经济计划，还必须采取正确的方法，使领导与群众相结合。一方面，基层计划单位在编制计划时，应吸收群众中的积极分子（如企业中车间的党、政、工、团负责人及先进的模范人物等等）参加，汲取群众的智慧，具体挖掘潜力，克服薄弱环节，解决关键问题，这样不仅可使计划进一步切合于实际，而且可为实现计划准备有利的条件。另方面，各级计划机关和企业的领导部门，应学习和掌握计划工作的基本方法，即平衡的方法，具体地研究需要与可能，反复进行平衡计算，发现其中的问题并寻求解决的办法。这样，我们就有可能避免盲目冒进和保守的倾向，避免主观主义，使计划既能起其动员群众的积极作用，推动各种经济事业不断地前进，又有确切可靠的依据，符合于客观的实际可能，并避免各经济部门之间、各种经济成分之间互相脱节的现象。
    在编制一九五四年度国民经济计划草案的同时，各企业单位及其领导部门必须为实现一九五四年计划作若干必要的准备工作，在抓紧增产节约运动，改善企业管理工作，完成一九五三年计划及增产节约计划的过程中，进行各项准备。如基本建设方面应抓紧为明年所必需的资源的勘察，及早安排设计工作，确定国内外的设备定货，准备建筑材料，以及调配技术力量和劳动力等等；在工业生产方面应于编制明年年度计划草案的同时，编好明年第一季的季度计划，并为明年准备部件和材料，做好订货工作，进行设备检修，增加必要的技术措施等等；此外如农业生产、商业及交通运输等方面也必须进行若干准备工作。
    现在距计划草案上报的时间只有一个多月，时间极为紧迫，而工作又极繁重，加之我们经验不足，计划机构力量薄弱，因此各级党委和政府必须大力领导和抓紧这一工作，迅速充实和组织计划工作的力量，安排好编制工作的程序，充分发挥群众的积极性，吸取编制一九五三年计划的经验教训，认真学习、掌握党和国家的方针政策，反复进行平衡计算，避免主观主义，以便我们能及时编制出一九五四年度的国民经济计划，按时于明年年初下达到各基层单位。在编制计划工作中，必须克服和防止拖延时间和草率从事的作法。必须指出：要编好计划，不仅计划部门应该全力以赴，更重要的是各级党和政府及企业的领导机关应将这一工作当作当前最重要的任务之一，这是编好一九五四年度国民经济计划的重要条件。
