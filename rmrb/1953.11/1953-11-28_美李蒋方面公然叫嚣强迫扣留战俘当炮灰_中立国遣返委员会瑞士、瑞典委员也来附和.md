Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 27th: A special correspondent for this agency reports: Just as the special agents under US command are brazenly resisting the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, causing the explanatory work to be paralyzed for a long time, the US State Department, the US military's anti-repatriation group in Seoul, and the Kuomintang bandits and the Li Seung-man bandits are openly conspiring to forcibly detain a large number of POWs in the Dongchang-ri POW camp, so as to force them to serve as soldiers for the Chiang and Li bandits, just as Li Seung-man did last time.

Hamblen, the infamous head of the US anti-repatriation group, has undisguisedly revealed the close connection between the US side and the Taiwan Kuomintang special agent organization, which directs special agents in the POW camps to beat and kill people to prevent repatriation. The so-called committee for assisting "anti-communist Chinese POWs in Korea," headed by special agent bosses Gu Zhenggang and Fang Zhi of the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang, opposed the custodial forces restricting the special agents. In Hamblen's letter to them on the 24th, he guaranteed "full respect" and "careful consideration" of the "opinions" of these Chiang bandit special agents. This special agent organization, responsible for planning and directing the activities of Chiang bandit special agents in the POW camps, has repeatedly clamored under US instructions to escort the Chinese POWs in the non-directly repatriated POW camps to Taiwan to serve as cannon fodder. In the letter, Hamblen, with a knowing and smug tone, rejoiced at the situation created by the special agents' sabotage of the explanatory work. He indicated that the US military authorities in Korea are "striving" to "cooperate" with the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial forces (in reality, intensifying the use of pressure) to achieve the US's premeditated "difficult task" of forcibly detaining POWs.

With the direct assistance of the US authorities, the aforementioned Chiang bandit special agent organization is increasingly frequently conducting open and direct contact with the Chiang bandit special agents planted in the Dongchang-ri POW camp through the so-called "embassy" of the Chiang bandits stationed in Seoul, in order to intensify their conspiracies. A dispatch from Tokyo on the 23rd said that the aforementioned Taiwan Chiang bandit special agent organization is airlifting a large number of letters to Seoul, which will be forwarded to the special agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp by the Chiang bandit "embassy" in Seoul. This fact once again exposes the relationship between the US authorities and the Kuomintang bandits and their agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp. Under US instructions, the Kuomintang bandit "ambassador" to the US held talks in Washington on the 24th with US Secretary of State Dulles and Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Walter Robertson on the "future" of the POWs. This official contact between the US and Chiang indicates that the long-standing US collusion with the Chiang bandits to plot the detention of Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs has taken on a new development.

On the same day, the Li Seung-man bandit gang's "Minister of Foreign Affairs" Byun Young-tae, acting on orders from the same master, continued to clamor for action to "release" the POWs under the custody of the neutral nations, stating that this was a new "task" that the Li Seung-man "government" must complete.

People see that Dulles's statement on the 17th that POWs must be "released" after the expiration of the 120-day neutral nation custodial period has not only made the Kuomintang and Li Seung-man running dogs eager to try, but has also found kindred spirits among some countries participating in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Dennick, the Swiss member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, said on the 24th that the Swiss delegation "hopes" to "release non-repatriated POWs" on January 22nd. It is worth noting that the Swiss representative is not enthusiastic about the solemn obligation he undertakes to implement the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "rules for explanatory and visitation work" to ensure that POWs are free from special agent control and can freely exercise their right to repatriation, but is in a hurry to cite the armistice agreement as a "basis" when echoing the US's argument for detaining POWs. Stenström, the Swedish member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, also made the same argument on the 23rd, saying, "All POWs should be released on January 22nd next year, regardless of whether they have heard the explanations."

Now, the explanatory work has been interrupted for the fifth time due to the obstruction of US special agents and has not been resumed. According to the materials revealed by returnees, the US has instructed the special agents in the POW camps to use all means to make the explanations impossible, so as to delay until after the "expiration" of the US's so-called explanation period, and then the US will detain all POWs under the name of "release." In order to implement the US plan, the special agents are implementing increasingly severe terrorist rule in the POW camps, so that the POWs cannot exercise their right to repatriation.

All these facts prove that the "stalemate" of the explanatory work is created by the US. With the Swiss and Swedish members refusing to fairly fulfill their due responsibilities in accordance with the "scope of authority," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is helpless in the face of the rampant activities of special agents sabotaging the explanations. This "stalemate" is being used by the US to step up its conspiracy to detain POWs in one fell swoop, making the armistice agreement on the POW issue in danger of becoming a scrap of paper.

Our Side Installs Heating Equipment in Songgok-ri Camp

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 27th: The US side has not yet begun to explain to the US POWs in the Songgok-ri neutral nation custodial camp. As the weather is getting colder, our side has recently installed all the heating equipment in the Songgok-ri explanation site and the Bulsan-ri isolation camp to facilitate the US to conduct explanations.

Our side completed the construction of permanent explanation facilities for the US side as early as October 4th, and completed the construction of the isolation camp on October 13th in order to isolate and guard the POWs who have been explained and those who have not been explained in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the "Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work." In contrast, the US side did not build an isolation camp at all in the Dongchang-ri camp. Moreover, during the process of our explanation work, the US side directed special agents to obstruct and sabotage the explanation work on the one hand, making it impossible for our side to complete the original planned explanation work every day; on the other hand, it opposed the isolation and custody of the POWs who had not been explained, and prevented them from leaving the camp to listen to the explanations, causing the explanation work to be repeatedly interrupted.

    美李蒋方面公然叫嚣强迫扣留战俘当炮灰
    中立国遣返委员会瑞士、瑞典委员也来附和
    【新华社开城二十七日电】本社特派记者报道：正当美方指挥下的特务对中立国遣返委员会进行横蛮的抵制，使解释工作长期陷于瘫痪的时候，美国国务院、汉城美军反对遣返组与国民党匪帮和李承晚匪帮之间毫不避讳地进行布置，准备强迫扣留东场里战俘营中的大批战俘，以便像李承晚前次所干的一样，强迫他们充当蒋、李匪帮的士兵。
    声名狼籍的美方反对遣返组组长汉布伦，已不加掩饰地表明了美方与指挥战俘营中特务打人杀人以阻止遣返的台湾国民党特务机构之间的紧密联系。台湾国民党匪帮的以特务头子谷正纲、方治为首的所谓援助“朝鲜反共中国战俘”的委员会反对看管部队对特务加以约束，二十四日发表的汉布伦答复它们的信里，保证“充分尊重”和“慎重考虑”这些蒋匪特务的“意见”，而这个专责策划指挥战俘营中蒋匪特务活动的特务机构，早已一再在美方授意下叫嚷着要把不直接遣返的战俘营中的中国战俘押解到台湾去充当炮灰。汉布伦在信里用心照不宣和暗暗得意的腔调，庆幸由于特务破坏解释工作而造成的局面，他表明：朝鲜美军当局正在“力求”与中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队“合作”
  （实际上就是加紧使用压力），以实现美方预谋的强迫扣留战俘的“困难任务”。
    在美方当局的直接协助下，上述蒋匪特务机构正在日益频繁地通过蒋匪驻汉城的所谓“大使馆”，与东场里战俘营中所安插的蒋匪特务进行公开和直接的联系，以加紧阴谋活动。二十三日来自东京的消息说：上述台湾蒋匪特务机构正在把大批信件空运汉城，由蒋匪驻汉城“大使馆”转交东场里战俘营中的特务。这一事实再次暴露了美方当局与国民党匪帮及其在东场里战俘营中的代理人之间的关系。在美方授意下，国民党匪帮驻美“大使”二十四日在华盛顿与美国国务卿杜勒斯和负责远东事务的助理国务卿华·罗伯逊就战俘的“前途”问题进行了会谈，美蒋之间的这种官方接触表明：长期以来美方勾结蒋匪策划的扣留中国人民志愿军战俘的阴谋已有了新的发展。
    在同一天，受命于同一个主子的李承晚匪帮的“外务部长官”卞荣泰，继续叫嚣要采取行动“释放”中立国看管下的战俘，他表示这是李承晚“政府”必须完成的新“任务”。
    人们看到：杜勒斯十七日谈话中所谓一百二十天中立国看管期满后必须“释放”战俘的调子，不仅使国民党和李承晚走狗跃跃欲试，而且在参加中立国遣返委员会的某些国家中也获得了知音。中立国遣返委员会瑞士委员邓尼克二十四日说：瑞士代表团“希望”在一月二十二日“释放非遣返战俘”。值得注意的是：瑞士代表对于他所承担的执行停战协定的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”与“解释和访问工作细则”以保障战俘不受特务控制而自由行使其遣返权利的庄严义务并不热心，但是在附和美方扣留战俘的论调的时候却急急忙忙地提出停战协定来作为“根据”。中立国遣返委员会的瑞典委员斯坦斯特鲁也在二十三日发表同样论调说， “所有战俘都应在明年一月二十二日释放，不论他们是否听过解释。”
    现在，解释工作在美方特务阻挠下第五次中断后一直未能恢复。根据归来人员揭露的材料，美方已指示战俘营中的特务用一切办法使解释根本不能进行，以便拖延到美方所谓的解释期限“满期”以后，由美方在“释放”的名义下把所有战俘加以扣留。为了执行美方的计划，特务分子正在战俘营中实行变本加厉的恐怖统治，使战俘不能行使遣返权利。
    所有这些事实证明：解释工作的“僵局”是美方一手造成的。在瑞士和瑞典委员拒绝公正地按照“职权范围”履行其应有的职责的情况下，中立国遣返委员会对特务破坏解释的猖狂活动束手无策，这一“僵局”正被美方利用来加紧进行一举而扣留战俘的阴谋，使停战协定关于战俘问题的协议有成为废纸的危险。
    我方在松谷里营场装好取暖设备
    【新华社开城二十七日电】美方迄今还没有开始对松谷里中立国看管营场里的美方战俘进行解释，由于天气日渐寒冷，我方最近已在松谷里解释场所和钵山里隔离营场安装好全部取暖设备，以便美方进行解释。
    我方早在十月四日全部修建好供美方使用的永久性解释设备，并且在十月十三日修建好隔离营场以便按照“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款的规定，隔离看管经过解释和未经解释的战俘。但是与此相反，美方在东场里营场根本没有修建隔离营场。而且在我方解释工作的进行中，美方指挥特务一方面阻挠和破坏解释工作，使我方每天不能完成原定的解释工作计划；另一方面反对把未经解释的战俘隔离看管，并且阻止他们出营场听取解释，使得解释工作一再陷于停顿。
