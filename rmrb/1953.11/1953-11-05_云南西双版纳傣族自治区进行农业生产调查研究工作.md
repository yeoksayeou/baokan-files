    Yunnan's Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region People's Government is undertaking a survey of the region's agricultural production situation to create conditions for the further development of agricultural production for all ethnic groups in the area. Based on the differing characteristics of production in the mountainous and plain areas of Xishuangbanna, cadres from the Autonomous Region People's Government Agricultural Technology Guidance Station and members of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government Ethnic Work Team have jointly formed an agricultural production survey team. In areas such as Jinghong, Menghai, and Gelanghe Hani Autonomous Region within the autonomous region, they are systematically investigating the production of several major crops such as rice and cotton, as well as tea. They are also studying the existing foundation and development conditions of local soil, water conservancy, and animal husbandry, as well as the existing good farming techniques of the various ethnic groups and the difficulties they still face in production. They plan to initially identify the key to developing local agricultural production and specific, effective methods within this year. After more than two months of effort, they have already collected a great deal of material and experience in areas such as building water conservancy projects in the plains, promoting crop rotation systems in the mountains, renovating and renewing tea trees, and the Dai people's original rice production technology.

    云南西双版纳傣族自治区进行农业生产调查研究工作
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府正着手调查该区农业生产情况，为进一步发展当地各族人民的农业生产创造条件。根据西双版纳山区和平坝生产情况不同的特点，自治区人民政府农业技术指导站的干部和云南省人民政府民族工作队的队员，联合组成农业生产调查小组，在自治区的版纳景洪、版纳勐海和格朗和爱尼族自治区等地，正有计划地分别调查水稻、棉花等几种主要农作物和茶叶的生产情况，当地的土壤、水利和牧畜业的现有基础与发展条件，以及各族人民现有较好的耕作技术和在生产中还存在着的困难等。他们计划在今年内，初步找出发展当地农业生产的关键和具体有效的办法。经过两个多月的努力，现在已经收集了许多在平坝兴修水利，在山区推行农作物轮种制，整修与更新茶树，以及傣族人民原有的水稻生产技术等方面的材料和经验。　（新华社）
