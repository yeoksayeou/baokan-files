    The POW camp controlled by U.S. spies is an epitome of the "American way of life"
    Li Gao

    Not long ago, the famous British journalist Derek Kartun published a book describing the United States - "America in 1953". In this book, after discussing the American anti-communist clamor, spy terror, torture and homicides, the author said: "One hundred and sixty million Americans have become objects of systematic demoralization and bestialization through the medium of the world's most complex and effective 'cultural' tools." The author specifically pointed out: The result of such "bestialization" has a "direct and terrible manifestation in the massacres repeatedly carried out in prisoner-of-war camps in Korea. The Koje Island and Pongam Island incidents are directly related to (American) classrooms, burlesque, and radio and television. As in Nazi Germany, the crimes required by an aggressive imperialism need to be committed by people with a special bestiality, insensitivity and mental derangement."
    This British journalist’s judgment hits the essence of the "American way of life". The recent events in the Dongchang-ri POW camp in Korea also prove this. Although the Dongchang-ri POW camp is under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, U.S. spies are still continuing to commit crimes against prisoners of war such as torture, murder, cutting flesh, dismemberment, and even digging up and eating the heart and liver of living people. Such crimes can only be committed by American-style, bestialized, and specially bestial "people".
    Turning people into beasts, thereby turning them into ruthless and unscrupulous secret agents, is one of the most prominent characteristics of the contemporary so-called "American way of life" - or rather, the way of life of the American reactionary ruling class. If you don't believe it, you can find "examples" by opening American newspapers.
    Please read this passage from the American "Life" magazine on June 6, 1947: "... Early in the morning, a group of lynching mobs drove in cars, took Earl (a black youth who had been arrested for no reason) from the prison in nearby Piggins, beat him, kicked him, hit him hard with the butt of a shotgun, then stabbed him five times, dug a large piece of meat from his arm, and then fired three shots from a shotgun, blowing off most of his head." Isn't this exactly the same as the Zhang Zilong incident? In the United States, such incidents of killing black people are "guaranteed" by law. The murderers carry amulets from the Ku Klux Klan, the police, and various U.S. intelligence organizations. "Life" magazine said that all the murderers in the above-mentioned murder case were declared "innocent" by the court, and they openly celebrated afterwards. Isn't this exactly the same as those who today oppose effective measures against secret agents, thereby condoning and encouraging secret agents to kill people arbitrarily in POW camps?
    The American reactionary ruling class is very appreciative of torture and massacre. They use newspapers, magazines, movies, radios, and even street "burlesque" that are flooded across the United States to disseminate this "American way of life" and American-style "humanitarianism" in every possible way. Kartun quoted several American statistics in his book "America in 1953": Children in Los Angeles can see 228 murders and 357 attempted murders on television every week. Among the 92 types of "burlesque" popular on American streets, 218 major crimes and 14 methods of murder were described in detail. In this kind of American "popular reading," gouging out the eyes of "communists" is described as a typical "American" heroic act. An American "burlesque" expert said: "With few exceptions, every American who was six years old in 1928 has now seen at least 18,000 pictures of beatings, shootings, strangulations, bloodshed, and torture executions in burlesque." This "American way of life" and America's unique "humanitarianism" has now been passed on to the executioners of the U.S. "Army Psychological Warfare Bureau" and the C.I.E. secret service of the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo and their disciples and grandchildren - the Li and Chiang secret agents, item by item, through direct instructions conveyed from the U.S. "hospitals," "garbage trucks," and radio transceivers sent into the POW camp in grain sacks.
    In such a slaughterhouse-like POW camp, what "freedom" do the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side have? General Thimayya, chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, said that the Dongchang-ri POW camp is "full of an atmosphere of gloom and terror". This atmosphere can also be found in the United States. This spring, reporters from New York's bourgeois newspapers reported after visiting seventy-two American universities and colleges that an atmosphere of stalking and terror was shrouding these schools, where "peace," "freedom," "liberalism," and so on had become taboo words. The American "Nation" weekly described the mood of American residents: "It is always frightening to interact with people, because you don't know if you will inadvertently complain a little and your neighbor will report it to the secret police." This American-style "freedom" is today concentratedly reflected in the POW camp in Dongchang-ri. Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who risked their lives to escape from the control of U.S. spies complained that in the camp, words such as "repatriation" and "motherland" had become taboo. The secret agents even forbade the prisoners of war to mention "Daqianmen brand cigarettes" and use the year "1953" because this was commonly used in China. Secret agents followed the prisoners of war when they got up to defecate at night. Prisoners of war who were eager to be repatriated had to cover their heads with quilts when sleeping, because they were afraid that speaking in their sleep would reveal their inner desire to miss their motherland, and the secret agents would hear it and turn them into a second Zhang Zilong. The book-burning methods used by the likes of McCarthy and Dulles to deceive the American people's ears and eyes have also been moved to the POW camp. The secret agents not only burned the proclamations issued to the prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side through the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but also burned bundles of the notification letters issued to the prisoners of war by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. They even destroyed the loudspeakers in the camp, so that the prisoners of war were completely isolated from the world except for hearing the threats and deceptions of the secret agents.
    Spokespersons for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force have repeatedly confirmed that no prisoner of war from the Korean and Chinese side dared to apply for repatriation or express their opinions requesting repatriation in the camp except at the risk of being killed by secret agents and shot by guards after climbing out of the four layers of barbed wire. But the truth is more than that. Not only did the prisoners of war lose "freedom of speech" in the camp, but even the freedom of "not speaking" was gone. The secret agents forced them to sing reactionary songs and shout reactionary slogans in the camp all day long, and even when explaining inside the tent, they had to keep chanting the phrases prepared by the secret agents. Otherwise, he would be executed in accordance with the "joint guarantee" method, and his companions would be affected.
    Speaking of "freedom of speech," people can't help but recall the famous saying of the great American writer Mark Twain. Mark Twain said that in the United States, "only the dead have freedom of speech, only the dead can tell the truth." But now, in the POW camp controlled by U.S. spies, even the dead cannot "tell the truth," because after the secret agents kill the prisoners of war, they have to chop up the corpses, burn them into ashes, and even put the ashes in the ditch and wash them away.
    While more than 20,000 captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side are being brutally persecuted by U.S. spies, American generals and politicians are shouting for prisoners of war to have "free choice." What do prisoners of war "choose"? Either "choose" the path taken by Zhang Zilong, being killed, chopped up, and burned into ashes by secret agents; or being forcibly detained by the U.S. side, separated from their hometown and relatives for life, and serving as cannon fodder under the enslavement of the U.S., Li, and Chiang bandits. The American propaganda machine is triumphantly calling this inhuman conspiracy a "victory" of "psychological warfare," and there are even people like the Swiss representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission helping to support it.
    However, kind people all over the world have seen a truth in Dongchang-ri. People have not only seen what the American "psychological warfare" is here, but also seen the characteristics of the so-called "American way of life". Undoubtedly, the "experience" gained by the American reactionary group in the POW camp in Dongchang-ri today will be used on the American domestic scene tomorrow, and will be applied to every corner of the world where American money, troops, and intelligence personnel go.

### 美方特务控制下的战俘营是“美国生活方式”的缩影

    美方特务控制下的战俘营是“美国生活方式”的缩影
    李  高
    不久以前，英国名记者德里克·卡东出版了一本描写美国的书——“一九五三年的美国”。在这本书里，作者谈到了充满美国的反共叫嚣、特务恐怖和酷刑凶杀等情况之后说：“美国的一亿六千万人，已成为通过世界上最复杂、最有效的‘文化’工具的媒介而进行有系统的败坏风气与禽兽化的对象。”作者特别指出：这样“禽兽化”的结果，“在朝鲜的战俘营中一再进行的屠杀事件上，有了直接和可怖的表现。巨济岛与蜂岩岛事件，是和（美国的）教室、滑稽画以及无线电与电视有直接联系的。和在纳粹德国一样，进行侵略的帝国主义所要求的罪行，是需要由一种具有特殊兽性、麻木不仁与神经失常的人来做的。”
    这位英国记者的判断是切中“美国生活方式”的实质的。最近朝鲜东场里战俘营内所发生的事件，同样可以证明。东场里战俘营虽然在中立国遣返委员会的看管之下，美方特务对战俘还在继续干着酷刑、谋杀、割肉、碎尸甚至挖吃活人心肝等罪行，这种罪行是只能由美国式的、禽兽化了的、具有特殊兽性的“人”才能干得出来的。
    把人变成禽兽，从而变成杀人不眨眼的无恶不作的特务，这是当代所谓“美国生活方式”——正确地说是美国反动统治阶级生活方式的最显著的一种特征。不信，翻开美国报纸就可以找到“例证”。
    请读一读一九四七年六月六日美国“生活”杂志的这一段记载吧：“……一清早，一群企图用私刑的暴民，开着汽车，把爱尔（一个无故被捕的黑人青年）从附近辟根斯地方的监狱里提出来，打他，踢他，用猎枪的枪柄重击他，然后猛刺他五下，从他的臂部挖出一大块肉，然后用猎枪轰击三响，把他的头部的一大半轰掉了。”这不正是和张子龙事件一样样的吗？在美国，这种残杀黑人的事件是有法律“保障”的。杀人犯随身带有三K党、警察和美国各种特务组织的护身符。“生活”杂志说，上述杀人案的全体凶犯都被法庭宣判“无罪”，他们事后还公开置酒相贺。这不正是和今天那些反对对特务采取有效措施以纵容、鼓励特务在战俘营中任意杀人的人们一模一样吗？
    美国反动统治阶级对于酷刑残杀是十分嘉许的。他们通过泛滥美国的报纸、杂志、电影、广播以至街头“滑稽画”来无孔不入地传播这种“美国生活方式”和美国式的“人道主义”。卡东在“一九五三年的美国”这本书中引用几项美国统计说：洛杉矶的儿童每星期可以从电视中看到二百二十八次杀人事件和三百五十七次谋杀未遂案。在流行美国街头的九十二种“滑稽画”中，详细描写了二百十八项大罪行和十四种杀人方法。在这种美国“通俗读物”里，挖掉“共产党人”的眼睛，被描写为典型的“美国人”的英雄行为。一个美国“滑稽画”专家说：“除去少数例外，美国每一个在一九
  二八年已达六岁的人，到现在至少已经由滑稽画中看到一万八千种关于殴打、放枪、绞杀、血肉横飞、酷刑处死的图画。”这种“美国生活方式”和美
  国特有的“人道主义”，现在已通过美国“陆军心
  理作战局”和东京美军总部的C·I·E特务机关
  的刽子手和他们的徒子徒孙——李、蒋特务，通过从美方的“医院”、“垃圾车”以及从粮食口袋中
  送到战俘营中的收发报机所传达的直接指示，一项
  一项地在东场里战俘营表演出来了。
    在这样的屠场似的战俘营中，朝中被俘人员还有什么“自由”呢？中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军说，东场里战俘营中“充满阴郁和恐怖的气氛”。这种气氛也是能够从美国找到根据的。今年春天，纽约的资产阶级报纸记者在访问了七十二个美国大学和学院后报道说，钉梢和恐怖气氛笼罩这些学校，在那里，“和平”、“自由”、“自由主义”等等都已成为忌讳的字眼。美国“民族”周刊描写美国居民的心境说：“和人来往总是提心吊胆，因为你不知道，是否会无意之间发了些牢骚，会给邻居报告给秘密警察。”这种美国式的“自由”今天是集中地反映在东场里的战俘营中。冒死逃出了美方特务控制的朝中战俘控诉：战俘们在营场中，“遣返”、“祖国”这一类名词都成了忌讳的字眼。特务们甚至禁止战俘提到“大前门牌香烟”和使用“一九五三年”年号，因为这是中国通用的。战俘们晚上起来大小便，身后都有特务跟着。渴望遣返的战俘在睡觉时要用被子蒙住头，因为恐怕讲梦话泄露了内心怀念祖国的意愿，被特务听到而变成张子龙第二。麦卡锡、杜勒斯之流用以蒙蔽美国人民耳目的焚书手段，也搬用到战俘营中来了。特务们不仅焚毁朝中方面通过中立国遣返委员会发给战俘的文告，而且把中立国遣返委员会发给战俘的公告信也成捆地烧掉了。他们甚至捣毁了营场中的扩音器，使战俘除了听到特务的恐吓、欺骗言词之外，完全与世隔绝。
    中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的发言人屡次证实：朝中战俘除了冒着被特务杀害和被看守兵枪击的危险爬出四层铁丝网之外，没有一个人敢于在营场中申请遣返或发表要求遣返的意见。但事实不止于此，战俘们在营场中不仅失去了“言论自由”，而且连“不言论”的自由也没有了。特务们强迫他们整天在营场内唱反动歌曲，叫反动口号，甚至到了解释帐篷内，还必须喃喃不绝地喊念特务们编好了的词句。不然，就要依“连保”办法把他处死，而且殃及他的同伴。
    谈到“言论自由”，人们不禁记起了美国大作家马克·吐温的名言。马克·吐温说：在美国，“只有死人才有言论自由，只有死人才能诉说真理”。但现在美方特务控制下的战俘营内，死人也不能 “诉说真理”了，因为特务们把战俘杀死以后，还要把死尸剁碎、烧成灰，连骨灰也放在水沟里冲走。
    当两万多朝中被俘人员遭受美方特务这样地残杀迫害的时候，美国的将军、政客们却在那儿喊叫让战俘“自由选择”。战俘“选择”什么呢？或者
  “选择”张子龙所走过的路，被特务杀死、剁碎、烧成灰；或者被美方强制扣留下来，终生与家乡骨肉分离，而去充当美李蒋匪帮奴役下的炮灰。对这种惨绝人寰的阴谋，美国的宣传机器正在洋洋得意地称之为“心理战”的“胜利”，而且还有像中立国瑞士代表那样的人为的帮腔。
    但是，全世界善良的人却在东场里看到了一个真理。人们不仅从这儿看到了美国的“心理战”是什么，而且也在这儿看到了所谓“美国生活方式”的特征。无疑地，美国反动集团今天在东场里战俘营中所取得的“经验”，明天就会反过来施用到美国国内，施用到美国的金元、军队和情报人员所到的世界各个角落里去的。
