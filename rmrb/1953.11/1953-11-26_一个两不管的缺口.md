    A Two-Headed, No-One-Cares Gap
    Reader Wang Lan writes: Outside the western wall of the Linxi Mine in the Kailuan Coal Mine, there is a ditch called Yangjia Gou (Yang Family Ditch). Water discharged from the Kailuan Coal Washing Plant flows through this ditch to more distant places. Previously, this ditch did not attract much attention. The ditch contained sewage, and the banks were covered with weeds, making it a desolate place seldom visited. However, since June and July of this year, the ditch water has contained hundreds of tons of coal dust every day, which has suddenly enlivened Yangjia Gou. More than thirty private businesses buying and selling coal dust have sprung up on both sides of the ditch. They have dug Yangjia Gou into numerous coal dust pools of various sizes, conducting coal dust trading on the spot. Now, this place is bustling with people digging, buying, and selling coal dust, and selling snacks, from morning till night. The desolate Yangjia Gou has become a small market.
    But, for whom is Yangjia Gou bustling? Why is so much coal dust flowing into Yangjia Gou? The coal dust is carried out from the Kailuan Coal Washing Plant during coal washing and water changing. To prevent the dust from escaping, the Kailuan Coal Washing Plant originally had four dust ponds inside, with a capacity of about 2,000 tons. Six more dust ponds, each with a capacity of about 1,200 tons, were dug inside the western wall (connecting to Yangjia Gou) to allow the dust to settle in the ponds during coal washing and water changing, preventing it from escaping. The Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration instructed that the dust in the ponds inside the coal washing plant be the responsibility of the plant to excavate and transport using machinery to the relevant departments, and the railway cars for loading the dust be the responsibility of the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section to supply; the dust in the six large dust ponds on the west side be the responsibility of the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section to excavate manually and transport. This year, the coal washing plant began washing large quantities of coal, producing approximately 200 tons of dust per day from January to August, increasing to more than 300 tons since September.
    Under these circumstances of massive dust production, the leaders of the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section and the Kailuan Coal Washing Plant have adopted an irresponsible attitude towards state property, creating a two-headed, no-one-cares gap. The Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section has serious departmentalism, believing that "the dust excavated from the dust ponds is not the income of the Railway Transportation Section, the dust ponds should be managed by the coal washing plant; the workers of the Railway Transportation Section are responsible for loading and unloading, and have no time to manage the excavation of dust." Therefore, the six large dust ponds on the west side have only been excavated three times this year. The dust ponds have been filled because no one has excavated them for a long time. Although the four dust ponds in the coal washing plant are excavated by the coal washing plant and transported by the Linxi Mine Railway Transportation Section, the two sides have not signed a contract. When the plant temporarily needs railway cars, the Railway Transportation Section cannot supply them in time, sometimes providing only three or four cars a day, and sometimes not providing a single car for several consecutive days. This has resulted in all the dust ponds being frequently filled with dust, causing a large amount of newly washed coal dust to flow out. Thus, the wealth of the state flows into Yangjia Gou and into the pockets of private merchants. According to reliable estimates, the dust flowing out every day often reaches more than 100 tons. How much dust has escaped this year? The relevant leaders are also unclear about this figure.
    The workers, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, are displaying a high degree of labor enthusiasm, devising various methods to produce one more can of coal for the country, save one more rope or one more iron nail; but some of the wealth they have created through hard work is being wasted by these masters. These masters should think: can they be worthy of the country, are they not failing the people's trust in them!

    一个两不管的缺口
    读者王蓝来信：开滦煤矿林西矿西边围墙以外有一条水沟叫杨家沟。开滦洗煤厂放出来的水，就经过这条沟流向远处。以前，这条沟并不惹人注意。沟里流的是污水，两岸长满杂草，是一块少有人迹的荒凉的地方。但是今年六、七月以来，沟水中每天有着上百吨的煤烟子，这就使杨家沟忽然热闹起来了。沟的两边出现三十多家买卖煤烟子的私营商户。他们把杨家沟挖成许许多多大大小小的煤烟子池，就地进行煤烟子的买卖。现在这块地方从早到晚都有挖烟子的、买卖烟子的、卖零食的，整天人马不断。荒凉的杨家沟变成一个小集市。
    但是，杨家沟究竟是为谁热闹起来的呢？为什么有这么多的煤烟子流进杨家沟呢？煤烟子是开滦洗煤厂洗煤换水时带出来的。为了避免烟子往外跑，开滦洗煤厂里面原设有四个约可装二千吨的烟子池，在西边围墙内（接连杨家沟的地方）又挖了六个各约可装一千二百吨的烟子池，使洗煤换水时烟子沉淀在烟子池内，不致外跑。开滦煤矿总管理处指示煤厂里面烟子池的烟子由该厂负责用机器挖装运交有关部门，装烟子的车皮由林西矿铁路运输科负责供应；西边六个大烟子池的烟子，由林西矿铁路运输科负责用人工挖后运交。今年洗煤厂开始大量洗煤，一月至八月每天约出烟子二百吨，九月份以来增至三百多吨。
    在这大量出烟子的情况下，林西矿铁路运输科和开滦洗煤厂领导上却对国家财富采取不负责任的态度，形成了一个两不管的缺口。林西矿铁路运输科存在严重的本位主义，认为“烟子池挖出来的烟子也不是铁路运输科的收入，烟子池应该归洗煤厂管；铁路运输科的工人是管装卸，没有工夫管挖烟子。”因此，西边六个大烟子池今年仅挖了三次。烟子池因长期没有人挖，都积满了。洗煤厂的四个烟子池虽由洗煤厂挖，由林西矿铁路运输科负责运输，但双方并没有订立联系合同。厂方临时要车皮，铁路运输科也不能及时供应，有时一天仅给三、四个车皮，有时甚至连续几天一个车皮也不给。这样就造成所有的烟子池经常积满烟子，新洗出来的煤烟子因而大量外流。于是国家的财富流进杨家沟，流到私商的荷包里。据可靠的估计，每天外流的烟子经常达一百多吨。究竟今年来跑出多少烟子呢？有关领导上也摸不清这个数字。
    工人们在增产节约运动中发挥高度的劳动热情，想出各种办法，给国家多出一罐煤，多节省一条绳或一根铁钉；但是他们辛辛苦苦创造出来的财富，一部分竟被这些老爷们白白扔掉了。这些老爷们应该想想：他们能不能对得起国家，是不是辜负了人民对他们的付托！
