Comrades of the Presidium, fellow representatives:

    The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representative Conference has now successfully concluded. After twenty-one days of joint efforts by the participating representatives, under the care and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and with the tireless efforts of the comrades participating in the conference work, our conference has achieved complete success and significant achievements. During the conference, we heard Chairman Chen Shutong's opening speech, instructing us: to strive to implement the national general line and correctly leverage the positive role of private industry and commerce; we also heard Vice Chairman Li Weihan's speech, clarifying the great significance of the national general line for the transition period and pointing out the bright path of gradually realizing the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. On behalf of all the participating representatives, I solemnly express our full support for the path and direction indicated by Chairman Chen Shutong and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. Under these significant inspirations, all of us representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors have engaged in repeated discussions, careful study, and self-examination, deeply recognizing the great victories our country has achieved in various aspects under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the past four years, and have begun the first five-year construction plan on the solid foundation of completing the economic recovery phase; recognizing that private industrialists and merchants, by following the national general line, loving the country, abiding by the law, and actively operating their businesses, will be able to play a certain positive role in the country's great construction cause and will be able to achieve their own transformation. At this moment, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce—our own national organization of the industrial and commercial sector—is officially established after more than a year of preparation. All of us industrialists and merchants across the country will certainly strive with greater confidence, earnest study, and active operation to contribute to the country's construction cause and our own transformation!

    Fellow representatives: Through the discussions and study of this conference, our thinking has clarified the major issues of the national general line for the transition period and the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce through state capitalism. This is the first major gain of this conference. The national general line and general task during the transition period for our country is to "gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization over a relatively long period, and gradually realize the state's socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce." Our country has long entered the transition period and has been carrying out socialist transformation for the past four years. For the welfare of the people, for the consolidation of national defense, and for the establishment of a brilliant socialist society, our country must gradually realize socialist industrialization, and must gradually realize socialist transformation of non-socialist economic components, and carry out the transformation of private industry and commerce through state capitalism. All of this had some principled stipulations in the Common Program long ago. Article 3 of the Common Program stipulates that the People's Republic of China must "steadily transform the agricultural country into an industrial country"; Article 28 of the Common Program stipulates that "the state-owned economy is an economy of a socialist nature," and "is the main material foundation for the development of production and the prosperity of the economy of the People's Republic, and the leading force of the entire social economy"; Article 31 of the Common Program stipulates that "the economy of cooperation between state capital and private capital is an economy of a state capitalist nature. Under necessary and possible conditions, private capital should be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism." These provisions are essentially the direction and content of socialist industrialization and the transformation of private industry and commerce. We have already walked on this road for four years, and now it has become clearer, and we should move forward with greater confidence.

    Fellow representatives: The state values us. Vice Chairman Li Weihan said that private industry and commerce "is an important economic factor of the country." We should understand the state's concern, actively operate our businesses, and conscientiously transform ourselves. How to carry out the transformation? Vice Chairman Li Weihan said: The People's Government will "based on the capitalists' willingness, and based on the needs and possibilities of the state, systematically, planned, and differentially first bring capitalist industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood basically (not all) into the orbit of state capitalism through various forms; at the same time, capitalist commerce that is necessary for the national economy and the people's livelihood should also continue to implement the policy of state capitalism differentially and systematically, based on needs and possibilities." We should clearly recognize that the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce is one of the major tasks during the country's transition period. That private industry and commerce can be gradually brought into the orbit of state capitalism and gradually undergo socialist transformation is beneficial to the country, beneficial to private enterprises, and beneficial to private industrialists and merchants individually. Here we first express that we private industrialists and merchants will enthusiastically support the national general line for the transition period with joy and enthusiasm, and are willing to complete the transformation from capitalism to socialism through state capitalism; at the same time, we also realize that in order to bring our enterprises into the orbit of state capitalism, we must first create conditions for ourselves and strive to meet the needs and possibilities of the state. At the same time, we also realize that the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce is a work of considerable length, and it is impossible to reach the sky in one step. Our industrial and commercial circles should work hard, study conscientiously, create conditions, and then the People's Government will be able to bring our enterprises into the orbit of state capitalism differentially and systematically, and implement socialist transformation.

    Private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are generally easier to bring into the orbit of state capitalism. We private industrialists should make more efforts to develop production that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, strive to cooperate with the country's plans, and enthusiastically participate in the movement to increase production and practice thrift. Increasing production and practicing thrift is one of the important conditions for the country to accumulate funds for large-scale economic construction; at the same time, increasing production and practicing thrift has a considerable driving effect on the improvement of the production and operation of private enterprises, and is beneficial to all aspects of public-private labor and capital. Therefore, we industrialists and merchants must respond to the government's call and actively participate in this movement.

    Private commerce is also valued by the country and is also within the scope of transformation. Private commerce plays a certain role in supplying needs and exchanging between urban and rural areas, and private commerce is wide-ranging and closely related to people's lives. The state must strengthen management in order to stabilize the market and ensure the people's needs. We private commercial operators must correct our work style, abide by market management, oppose speculation and hoarding, and actively make efforts that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood in order to strive for transformation.

    Fellow representatives: Through the discussions and study of this conference, we have clearly recognized the national general line for the transition period and the future of the transformation of private industry and commerce, which has increased our infinite confidence. However, at the same time, we must be strictly vigilant and not repeat the "five evils." The state values us and leads us to take the path of actively operating our businesses and correctly transforming ourselves, but if we ourselves cannot overcome the bourgeoisie's selfish and destructive negativity, that will become an obstacle to the future of the transformation of private industry and commerce. Through the education of the "Five-Anti" movement, many people in the industrial and commercial circles have made progress in their thinking and work style, but through the recent self-examination and supplementary reporting work, it has been revealed that there are still quite a few private industrialists and merchants who have varying degrees of illegal facts of tax evasion and tax evasion, and there is a phenomenon of shoddy workmanship in processing and ordering, and there are illegal behaviors such as hoarding, cornering, raising prices, and panic buying in commerce. Faced with such a serious illegal situation, can we private industrialists and merchants fail to be vigilant? It can be seen that the ideological transformation of our industrialists and merchants is still a long-term and serious task. Criticism and self-criticism must be constantly and repeatedly carried out within the industrial and commercial circles, and necessary struggles must be carried out against illegal industrialists and merchants; we must continue to strengthen learning, continue to strengthen the education of loving the country and abiding by the law, and constantly improve our political level and ideological level, which will be the basic conditions for our industrialists and merchants to obtain transformation. We must do this in order to obtain transformation; we must do this in order to advance together with the people of the whole country.

    Fellow representatives: Our motherland has already launched the great construction of socialist industrialization, and our motherland will become not only politically but also economically independent and strong. The prosperous and strong People's Republic of China, under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, is not only a happy paradise for all our people, but also a strong fortress for defending peace in the Far East and even the world. Under the leadership of the working class, the Chinese national bourgeoisie, as one of the constituent elements of the people's democratic dictatorship, is fortunate; it is an honor for us private industrialists and merchants to play a certain role in the great construction cause of the motherland. Fellow representatives! Let us, with grateful hearts, optimistic spirits, and firm confidence, unite the industrial and commercial circles across the country, and bravely advance on the road of national construction and self-transformation!

    Long live the great People's Republic of China!
   
    Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!

    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    在中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会闭幕式上
    李烛尘的闭幕词
    主席团、各位代表：
    中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会现在胜利闭幕了。经过二十一天来与会代表们的共同努力，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的关怀和领导下，在参加会议工作的同志们的辛劳不倦的努力下，我们的大会已经获得了圆满的成功，并获得了重大的成就。在会议中，我们听到了陈叔通主席的开幕词，指示我们：要为实行国家总路线、正确地发挥私营工商业的积极作用而奋斗；我们又听到了李维汉副主任的讲话，为我们阐明国家过渡时期总路线的重大意义，给我们指示出私营工商业逐步实现社会主义改造的光明道路。我谨代表与会的全体代表，郑重表示我们完全拥护陈叔通主席和李维汉副主任所指示的道路和方向。我们全体工商界代表在这些重大的启示下，进行了反复的讨论，细心的学习，并进行了自我检查，深切认识了在中国共产党的正确领导下，四年来我们国家在各方面获得的伟大胜利，并且在完成了经济恢复阶段的稳固基础上开始了第一个五年建设计划；认识到私营工商业者遵循国家总路线，爱国守法，积极经营，将能在国家的伟大建设事业中发挥一定的积极作用，并将能获得自身的改造。当此时会，中华全国工商业联合会——我们工商界自己的全国性的组织，经过一年多的筹备，今天宣告正式成立了。我们全国工商业者，必将以更大的信心，认真学习，积极经营，为祖国的建设事业和我们自身的改造而努力奋斗！
    各位代表：通过这次大会的讨论和学习，在我们的思想上明确了国家在过渡时期的总路线和通过国家资本主义逐步进行私营工商业的社会主义改造这一重大问题。这是这次大会第一个重大收获。我们国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，是要“在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造”。我们国家早已进入了过渡时期，并且在过去四年中已在进行着社会主义改造。为了人民的福利，为了国防的巩固，为了建立一个光辉灿烂的社会主义社会，我们的国家必须逐步实现社会主义工业化，对非社会主义经济成分必须逐步实现社会主义改造，并通过国家资本主义进行对私营工商业的改造。这一切，早在共同纲领中有了若干原则的规定。共同纲领第三条规定，中华人民共和国必须“稳步地变农业国为工业国”；共同纲领第二十八条规定，“国营经济为社会主义性质的经济”，“为人民共和国发展生产、繁荣经济的主要物质基础和整个社会经济的领导力量”；共同纲领第三十一条规定，“国家资本与私人资本合作的经济为国家资本主义性质的经济。在必要和可能的条件下，应鼓励私人资本向国家资本主义方向发展”。这些规定，实质上就是社会主义工业化和私营工商业改造的方向和内容。我们在这条大路上业已走了四年，现在更加明确起来了，我们应该更加满怀信心地迈步前进。
    各位代表：国家对我们是重视的。李维汉副主任说，私营工商业“是国家的一项重要经济因素”，我们应该善体国家重视之意，积极经营，认真改造。怎样进行改造？李维汉副主任说：人民政府将
  “依据资本家们的自愿，并依据国家的需要和可能，有步骤、有计划、有区别地首先将有利于国计民生的资本主义工业经过各种形式基本上（不是全部）纳入国家资本主义轨道；同时对国计民生所必须的资本主义商业也要依据需要和可能，继续有区别、有步骤地实行国家资本主义的方针”。我们应该明确认识：私营工商业的社会主义改造，是国家过渡时期的重大任务之一。私营工商业能够逐步地纳入国家资本主义的轨道，逐步地进行社会主义改造，这对国家有利益，对私营企业有利益，对私营工商业者个人亦是有利益的。我们在这里首先表示，我们私营工商业者将以欢欣鼓舞的心情，热诚拥护国家过渡时期总路线，愿意通过国家资本主义，完成由资本主义到社会主义的改造；同时，我们也认识到，要将我们的企业纳入国家资本主义轨道，首先要我们自己创造条件，争取符合国家的需要和可能。同时我们也体会到，私营工商业的社会主义改造，是一件相当长时间的工作，不可能一步登天，我们工商界应该努力工作，认真学习，创造条件，然后人民政府才有可能，有区别、有步骤地将我们的企业纳入国家资本主义轨道，实行社会主义改造。
    有利于国计民生的私营工业，一般地说，是比较易于纳入国家资本主义轨道的。我们私营工业者更要努力发展有利于国计民生的生产，努力配合国家的计划，热烈地投入增产节约运动。增产节约是国家积累资金以进行大规模经济建设的重要条件之一；同时，增产节约对于私营企业的生产经营之改善，具有相当大的推动作用，对于公私劳资各方面都有好处。因此，我们工商业者必须响应政府的号召，积极参加这一运动。
    私营商业，同样为国家所重视，同样在改造范围之内。私营商业，对供应需要、城乡交流起着一定的作用，而且私营商业面广人众，与人民生活息息相关，国家必须加强管理，才能稳定市场，保证人民需要。我们私营商业经营者必须要端正作风，服从市场管理，反对投机套购，积极作有利于国计民生的努力，以争取改造。
    各位代表：通过这次大会的讨论和学习，我们已明确认识了国家过渡时期总路线和私营工商业改造的前途，给我们增加了无限的信心。但是，我们同时也要严加警惕，不要重犯“五毒”。国家重视我们，领导我们走积极经营正确改造的路，但我们自己若不能克服资产阶级唯利是图的消极性和破坏性，那将会成为私营工商业改造前途的障碍。通过“五反”运动的教育，工商界中，已有许多人，在思想上和作风上，有了进步，但是经过最近的自查补报工作，揭发出私营工商业者中还有相当多的人有不同程度的偷税漏税的违法事实，在加工订货中，则存在着偷工减料的现象，在商业方面，则存在着囤积套购、抬价、抢购等不法行为。面对这样严重的违法情况，我们私营工商业者能够不引为警惕吗？可见我们工商业者的思想改造还是一件长期的严重的工作，在工商界内部必须不断地反复地展开批评和自我批评，对不法工商业者进行必要的斗争；必须继续加强学习，继续加强爱国守法的教育，不断提高自己的政治水平和思想水平，这将是我们工商业者获得改造的基本的条件。必须如此，我们才可能获得改造；必须如此，我们才可能与全国人民一道前进。
    各位代表：我们祖国业已展开社会主义工业化的伟大建设，我们祖国不仅在政治上而且也将在经济上独立强大起来。繁荣富强的中华人民共和国，在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，不仅是我们全国人民的幸福乐园，而且是保卫远东以至世界和平的坚强堡垒。在工人阶级领导之下，作为人民民主专政构成分子之一的中国民族资产阶级，是幸运的；我们私营工商业者能在祖国的伟大建设事业中起一定的作用，是光荣的。各位代表！让我们以感激的心情，乐观的精神，坚定的信心，团结全国工商界，在祖国建设和自我改造的大路上奋勇前进吧！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
