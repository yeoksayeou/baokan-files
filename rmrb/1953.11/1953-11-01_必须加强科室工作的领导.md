    Must Strengthen Leadership of Department Work

    In the ongoing increase production and practice economy campaign in some enterprises, there is a phenomenon of "workshops compete, departments watch." Some department personnel feel that they seem to "have nothing to do" or "little effect" in the increase production and practice economy campaign. Some department personnel say: "The factory director orders to increase tasks, the trade union mobilizes and is also busy, we follow along and run errands, but running around is useless." A material department staff member said: "Materials are delivered, responsibility is fulfilled, there is nothing else to do." These phenomena fully illustrate that the responsibilities of department work are unclear, not oriented towards the workshop, and not serving production; it also reflects that the Party and government leadership of these enterprises has not strengthened the leadership of department work, and does not know how to fully utilize the department structure to strengthen management work to promote production; it also reflects that the trade unions in these enterprises have not organized department staff into the labor competition.

    Department staff are by no means idle in the increase production and practice economy campaign. The problem is that the Party and government leaders and trade unions of enterprises must pay close attention to the role of department work and the technical personnel and staff in the departments.

    The leading cadres of the 53rd Factory paid attention to this issue, and they achieved results. In the increase production and practice economy movement, the various business departments of the factory analyzed the workshop's production, cost, capital, labor efficiency, product quality, and other items according to the business system, and discovered the potential strength of the workshops. After each department put forward a plan, it was balanced by the accounting department to create a plan to reduce costs and increase output. After they did this, the workshop directors were very welcome for the department staff to calculate costs and help identify problems from the costs, so as to fully grasp the production situation and complete the increase production and practice economy plan with confidence, and also lay the foundation for the workshop to implement comprehensive economic accounting. The workers also welcome department staff to help them calculate detailed accounts so as to specifically understand the economic value of their production, so as to find potential and discover problems and correct them at any time. The workers in the workshops are more welcome for the technical staff to cooperate with the workers to find tricks, tap potential, and improve production. The economy work of the department staff of the 53rd Factory is also successful, they pay attention to saving administrative management expenses. In each department, everyone sorted out and turned in public goods that were not urgently needed. They said: "Let the public's things flow, which can reduce expenses and lower costs." The 53rd Factory saved 100 million yuan in enterprise management fees this time. Who can say this is a small amount! Who can say that department staff "have nothing to do" in the increase production and practice economy!

    It should be recognized that the increase production and practice economy of enterprises must be combined with mobilizing the masses to improve the operation and management of enterprises. Mobilizing the masses requires not only mobilizing workers, but also mobilizing department staff, and to improve the operation and management of enterprises, it is even more necessary to organize the strength of various functional departments. Only when all aspects of enterprise management are done well can the workshop's increase production and practice economy competition be carried out smoothly. Therefore, the Party and government leaders and trade unions of enterprises must understand the specific situation of department work in each period, and in strengthening planning management or technical management and implementing the responsibility system, help the departments formulate specific work plans according to the needs of production, so that department work and workshop work are closely linked. And should select key points in the departments, and plan to cultivate advanced figures and advanced departments to promote the overall situation. Model staff in the departments should be rewarded. In short, leadership of department work should be strengthened in order to fundamentally improve it politically, ideologically, organizationally, and in working methods, so as to truly improve enterprise management work.

    Comrades working in the departments, you should never "stand idly by" in the increase production and practice economy movement, and you should never just sit in the office to work, or just go to the workshop to "run errands"; but you should use your brains, cooperate closely with the workers, and strive to complete the production plan and the increase production and practice economy plan!

### 必须加强科室工作的领导

    必须加强科室工作的领导
    在若干企业的增产节约竞赛当中，存在着“车间竞赛，科室旁观”的现象。有的科室人员感到他们在增产节约竞赛中似乎“无事可作”，或者“作用不大。”有的科室人员说：“厂长下令加任务，工会动员也忙碌，我们跟着跑跑腿，跑来跑去没用处。”有个材料科的工作人员说：“材料送到，责任尽到，没有事了。”这些现象，充分说明了科室工作职责不明，没有面向车间，没有为生产服务；也反映了这些企业的党政领导方面没有加强对科室工作的领导，不会充分运用科室机构去加强管理工作以推动生产；同时也反映了这些企业的工会在组织劳动竞赛当中没有把科室工作人员组织进去。
    科室工作人员在增产节约竞赛当中绝不是无事可作，问题在于企业的党政领导和工会必须十分注意发挥科室工作和科室中的技术人员和职员的作用。
    五三工厂的领导干部注意了这个问题，他们就收到了成绩。该厂的各个业务科在增产节约运动中按照业务系统分别分析了车间的生产、成本、资金、劳动效率、产品质量等项目，从中发现车间的潜在力量，各科提出计划后，交由会计科加以平衡，作出降低成本，增加产量的计划。他们这样作了以后，车间主任非常欢迎科室人员去计算成本，帮助从成本中发现问题，以便全面掌握生产情况，心中有数地完成增产节约计划，同时也为车间实行全面经济核算打下基础。工人们也欢迎科室人员去帮助他们算细账，以便具体了解自己生产的经济价值，从而找出潜力，发现毛病随时纠正。车间的工人们更欢迎技术人员们与工人合作找窍门、挖潜力，改进生产。五三厂的科室工作人员们的节约工作也是有成绩的，他们注意节省行政管理费的开支。在各科大家都把不急需的公用东西整理上缴。他们说：“让公家的东西流动起来，就可以减少开支，降低成本。”五三厂这次节省的企业管理费就有一亿元。谁能说这是很小的数目呢！谁能说科室人员在增产节约当中“无事可做”呢！
    应该认识：企业的增产节约必须与发动群众改善企业的经营管理工作相结合。发动群众，不仅要发动工人，也要发动科室的工作人员，而且要改善企业的经营管理，更必须组织各职能机构的力量。只有企业各方面的管理工作作好了，车间的增产节约竞赛才能够顺利进行。因此，企业的党政领导和工会，必须了解每个时期科室工作的具体情况，并在加强计划管理或技术管理以及贯彻责任制的工作中，根据生产的要求，帮助科室订出具体的工作计划，使科室工作和车间工作密切衔接起来。并应该在科室中选择重点，有计划地培养先进人物、先进科室，以推动全盘。对于科室中的模范工作人员，应该给予奖励。总之，应该加强科室工作的领导，才能从政治上、思想上、组织上和工作方法上加以根本的改进，达到真正改善企业管理工作的目的。
    科室中的工作同志们，对于增产节约运动也绝不应该“袖手旁观”，绝不应该只坐在办公室办公，或者只到车间“跑跑腿”；而应该开动脑筋，密切与工人合作，为完成生产计划和增产节约计划而努力！
