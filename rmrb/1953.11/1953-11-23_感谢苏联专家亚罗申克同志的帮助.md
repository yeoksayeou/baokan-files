    Thank you to Soviet expert Comrade Yaroshenko for his help
    Yu Zhou, Director of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Bureau, Central Ministry of Railways
    As the motherland entered the first year of the Five-Year Plan, our beloved Soviet expert, Comrade Yaroshenko, arrived. From the day he came, he dedicated all his efforts to helping us improve our work. Thanks to his assistance, the entire face of our factory management department has undergone significant changes.
    Locomotive and rolling stock repair factories are the technical bases that ensure the normal operation of railway locomotives and rolling stock. Due to the complex types and structures of locomotives and rolling stock, and the varying degrees of wear and tear during operation, a high degree of organization and planning is even more strictly required of repair factories. However, in the past, the factories under our bureau did not have operational plans that suited this characteristic to control and promote production. As a result, enterprise management appeared chaotic, product quality was poor, production was extremely uneven, workers described the assembly line as "no flow at the beginning of the month, and a flood at the end of the month," overtime work increased, work-related injuries increased, leading to leaders being caught in a state of chaos, and the enthusiasm of workers for production could not be fully exerted. In the first quarter of this year, the fourteen factories under our bureau only completed 89.1% of the total value of goods, with costs exceeding by 2.7%. This inevitably affected the improvement of railway transportation efficiency. Around July last year, after inspecting the locomotive and rolling stock repair factories in Mudanjiang, Qiqihar, Huanggu Tun and other places in Northeast China, Comrade Yaroshenko put forward programmatic suggestions for reversing the chaotic situation in production, such as production preparation work, operation plans, the relationship between vehicle use and repair, and quality issues. These suggestions run through the spirit of the central government's instructions to strengthen planned management and improve the responsibility system, and are a set of systematic, comprehensive, and specific planned management systems. After research, the Ministry of Railways issued it as Department Order No. 301 for implementation.
    In March of this year, the expert personally went to the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory to help conduct key inspections and begin the work of implementing Department Order No. 301, and put forward 109 suggestions, reversing the chaotic situation in the factory's production. "Promoting Department Order No. 301 and implementing expert suggestions" has become the central slogan of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's activities. The main content of the factory's improvement of planned management is to implement the expert's suggestion of "focusing on the first operation," so a strict identification system for repairing and replacing parts after the locomotive is disassembled was established, overcoming the shortcomings of not being able to grasp the scope of parts repair in the past, laying the foundation for correctly compiling operation plans, and establishing monthly, ten-day, daily, and even hourly operation plans. The workers said, "With a plan, we no longer grab blindly." In order to check the implementation of the plan, a daily meeting system was established, production scheduling work was strengthened, and the past phenomenon of many meetings, long hours, failure to solve problems, and no one being responsible for scheduling was changed. In order to ensure balanced production, a "production progress dynamic table" was also established to control the inventory of each process, and the quality responsibility system of "repair record books" was implemented, so that the return and rework rate decreased month by month. After the establishment of these systems, the confidence of the factory's cadres in completing tasks was strengthened, and the morale of the masses was also high. The factory turned from failing to complete its tasks every month in the first quarter to completing or overfulfilling its tasks every month. Under the expert's patient guidance, after many studies, the workers learned to use Soviet welding rods to perform overhead welding, overcoming the difficulty of the heavy furnace lifting in medium-sized locomotive repairs. The factory's workers gratefully said, "Wherever the expert goes, the skills there improve, and there are no more difficulties."
    After April of this year, Comrade Yaroshenko participated in the inspection of the implementation of Department Order No. 301 in locomotive and rolling stock repair factories in Jiang'an, Zhuzhou, Puzhen, Qishuyan and other places, and specifically guided each factory on how to implement the suggestions. Later, the Ministry of Railways printed and distributed the experience of factories that had implemented Department Order No. 301 well to locomotive and rolling stock repair factories across the country, and sent people to the factories to give reports, so the expert's suggestions were quickly promoted to factories across the country. Factories that seriously studied and implemented the expert's suggestions have undergone significant changes, such as the Wuhan Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, which began to implement the expert's suggestions in July, and won the national red flag in October.
    More than half a year of practice has proved that Comrade Yaroshenko's programmatic suggestions are completely in line with the specific conditions of our bureau's locomotive and rolling stock repair factories. Once it is grasped by leading cadres and combined with the creativity of the masses, and transformed into the actual actions of the masses, it will inevitably lead to significant reforms in enterprise management. From the second quarter, the factories have been successively incorporated into the track of planned management. The completion rate of the total value of goods in the second quarter of the factories increased by 17.3% compared with the first quarter, and the cost decreased by 0.1% compared with the plan. Some factories have basically achieved balanced vehicle delivery on a ten-day basis.
    In the current movement to increase production and practice economy, we are especially grateful to Comrade Yaroshenko for his help. In his reports and talks, Comrade Yaroshenko always emphasized the role and significance of repair factories in railway transportation. He pointed out that the most important task of repair factories is to continuously improve the capacity and efficiency of transportation and ensure the completion of national transportation tasks. Therefore, every employee, especially leading cadres, must take this task as a prerequisite when considering every work measure. He severely pointed out to comrades who neglected product quality and demanded "careless acceptance" that they must always think about the safety of passengers. He repeatedly instructed that "all technical measures should be subject to the country's political and economic interests" and that "the number of days locomotives and rolling stock spend in the factory must be greatly shortened to accelerate the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock." These principles have deeply educated many cadres who have serious purely technical viewpoints, departmentalism, and "not accounting for completing tasks." These principles guide us to not only work from the factory itself in the movement to increase production and practice economy, but also to improve product quality, shorten the number of days locomotives and rolling stock spend in the factory, and achieve improved transportation efficiency, creating technical conditions for the entire railway transportation to increase production and practice economy.
    Comrade Yaroshenko has made many specific suggestions for economizing. In fact, every suggestion he makes for improving production is permeated with a profound spirit of economy. For example, the aforementioned method of determining the scope of parts repair is not only the basis of the operation plan, but also rationally compresses the repair and replacement rate, corrects the past practice of blindly "dismantling and replacing in large quantities," so that a locomotive can save 52% of live parts, and the cost of labor and materials is greatly reduced. The masses said that the expert's suggestion is a key that opens the door to economy. Comrade Yaroshenko never let go of even the smallest waste in the factory. Some factories have always thrown the removed old asbestos into the garbage dump. After accepting the expert's suggestion, after treatment, they mixed it with new asbestos, which not only guaranteed quality, but also saved more than 5 million yuan per locomotive. When he saw that the workers had accepted the suggestion and used waste screw supports to remake files, his joy was indescribable.
    Comrade Yaroshenko not only gave us a lot of help in technology, but also set a good example for us in work style and work methods. Although he is over fifty years old, he has worked tirelessly since coming to China, often studying how to strengthen the weak links in production late into the night. Once, he insisted on working even when he was ill at the Mudanjiang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Northeast China. When comrades advised him to rest, he always said, "For the sake of work, don't worry about me." He is so passionate and loyal to our work. He makes suggestions based on the urgent problems existing in production, always taking the trouble to investigate personally and talk to workers. In order to find out the true condition of the boiler, he endured high temperatures and drilled in to check, and he was relieved only after the problem was solved. Everyone who has come into contact with him feels that he is as kind and amiable as family. He welcomes everyone to ask questions and patiently tells you everything he knows in detail until you fully understand it. He will enthusiastically encourage you for any small work improvement, but he will also seriously and sincerely criticize even a small mistake and tell you how to correct it. With deep love, he cares about the workers everywhere, from the mechanization of heavy work, technical safety, labor protection facilities, to the most neglected factory cleaning and construction site layout, he has made many practical suggestions.
    Comrade Yaroshenko's noble qualities and rich experience in socialist enterprise management are good examples for us to learn from. He is our beloved friend and teacher. We deeply realize that every achievement under his help is closely related to the motherland's industrialization gradually transitioning to socialism and strengthening the world's peace forces.
    Therefore, we are determined to follow Chairman Mao's words, work hard to learn from the Soviet Union, further implement expert suggestions, strengthen planned management, gradually promote technical operation processes, and organize specialized workshops to improve product quality, consolidate operational balance, shorten the production cycle, and meet the growing needs of national transportation.

    感谢苏联专家亚罗申克同志的帮助
    中央铁道部机车车辆修理局局长  于洲
    当祖国进入五年建设计划的头一年时，我们敬爱的苏联专家——亚罗申克同志来到了。他从来的那天开始，就拿出全部力量帮助我们改进工作。由于他的帮助，使我们整个厂务部门的面貌起了显著的变化。
    机车车辆修理工厂是保证铁路机车车辆正常运行的技术基地，由于机车车辆型类和构成复杂，运行中磨损程度不一，就更加严格要求修理工厂的高度组织性和计划性。但过去我局所属各工厂没有适应这个特点的作业计划来控制和推动生产。因此企业管理显得混乱，产品质量低劣，生产极不均衡，工人指流水作业是“月初不流水，月底发大水”，加班加点，工伤事故增多，以致领导陷于忙乱，工人生产积极性不能充分发挥。今年第一季度我局所属十四个工厂仅完成商品总值百分之八九点一，成本超出百分之二点七。这就必然影响了铁路运输效率的提高。亚罗申克同志在去年七月左右，去东北牡丹江、齐齐哈尔、皇姑屯等机车车辆修理工厂检查工作后，提出了扭转生产混乱局面的纲领性的建议，如生产准备工作，作业计划，用车与修车关系及质量问题等等。这个建议贯串了中央指示加强计划管理健全责任制的精神，是一套系统、全面、具体的计划管理制度。铁道部研究后便以第三○一号部令颁布执行。
    今年三月，专家亲自到长辛店机车车辆修理工厂帮助重点检查开始贯彻三○一号部令的工作，并提出了一百零九条建议，扭转了该厂生产的混乱局面。“推行三○一号部令，贯彻专家建议”已成为长辛店机车车辆修理工厂活动的中心口号，该厂改善计划管理的主要内容是执行专家“抓紧第一个作业”的建议，所以建立了机车解体后对修换配件施行严格鉴定的制度，克服了过去掌握不住配件检修范围的缺点，给正确编制作业计划打下了基础，并建立了月、旬、日以至小时的作业计划，工人说：“有了计划，不再瞎抓了。”为了检查计划的执行，建立了日常会议制度，加强了生产调度工作，转变了过去会议多，时间长，不能解决问题及调度无人负责的现象，为保证生产均衡进行，还建立了“生产进度动态表”，控制了每一工序的保有量，并推行“检修记录簿”的质量负责制，使返工回修率逐月下降。这些制度建立之后，加强了该厂干部对完成任务的信心，群众情绪也高涨了。该厂从第一季度月月完不成任务，扭转为月月完成或超额完成任务。工人们在专家的耐心指导下，经过多次研究，学会了用苏联焊条施行仰焊，克服了中修机车繁重的吊炉的困难。该厂的工人感激地说：“专家到那里，那里手艺提高，困难就没有了。”
    今年四月以后，亚罗申克同志参加检查了江岸、株洲、浦镇、戚墅堰等机车车辆修理工厂执行三○一号部令的情况并具体指导各厂如何执行建议。以后铁道部把执行三○一号部令较好的工厂的经验印发到全国各机车车辆修理工厂，并派人到各厂作报告，所以专家的建议很快就推广到全国各厂。凡是认真学习和执行专家建议的工厂都有了显著的转变，如武汉江岸机车车辆修理工厂七月开始执行专家建议，十月就夺得了全国红旗。
    半年多的实践证实了亚罗申克同志这个纲领性的建议，是完全符合我局各机车车辆修理工厂具体情况的。当它一经为领导干部所掌握，并与群众的创造性相结合，变为群众实际行动的时候，必然引起企业管理上的显著改革，各工厂从第二季度起已先后纳入到计划管理的轨道上来。各厂第二季度的商品总值完成率较第一季度提高百分之十七点三，成本较计划降低百分之零点一，有的厂已基本上作到按旬均衡出车。
    在目前进行增产节约运动当中，我们尤其感谢亚罗申克同志对我们的帮助。亚罗申克同志在他的报告和谈话里，总是首先强调修理工厂在铁路运输上的作用和意义，他指出修理工厂最主要的任务是使运输的能力和效率不断提高，保证完成国家运输任务，因此每一员工，特别是领导干部在考虑每一工作措施时，必须把这个任务作为前提。他对忽视产品质量，要求“马虎验收”的同志，严肃地指出必须时时想着旅客的安全。他曾反复指示“一切技术措施应当服从国家政治、经济利益”，“必须大力缩短机车车辆在厂日数，以加速机车车辆周转”。这些原则使许多存在着严重的单纯技术观点、本位主义、和“完成任务不算账”的干部受到深刻的教育。这些原则指引我们在增产节约运动中不仅从工厂本身来做，还要从提高产品质量，缩短机车车辆在厂日数，达到提高运输效率，为整个铁路运输的增产节约创造技术条件。
    亚罗申克同志对于节约的具体建议是非常多的。实际上他对提高生产的每一建议，无不渗透着深刻的节约精神。譬如前面所说到的确定配件检修范围的说法，它不但是作业计划的基础，并且由于它合理地压缩了修换率，纠正了过去盲目“大拆大换”的做法，使一台机车能节省百分之五十二的活件，而且工料费用大大减低，群众都说专家这个建议是把钥匙，打开了节约的大门。亚罗申克同志对于工厂很小的浪费也从不放过。有的厂历来把拆下的旧石棉扔进垃圾堆，接受专家建议后，经过处理，掺着新石棉用，既保证质量，一台机车还节省五百多万元。当他看见工人接受了建议，用废螺撑改制成锉刀时，他的高兴是难以形容的。
    亚罗申克同志不但在技术上给我们许多帮助，在工作作风和工作方法上也是我们学习的好榜样。他虽然是五十多岁的人了，但来到中国，从不知疲倦地工作着，常常深夜还在研究如何加强生产上的薄弱环节。有一次他在东北牡丹江机车车辆修理工厂病了还坚持工作，当同志们劝他休息时，他总是说，“为了工作不要为我。”他对我们的工作是那样的热爱和忠诚，他根据生产上的存在的迫切问题提建议，总是不辞劳苦地亲自调查，找工人谈话。为了弄清锅炉的真实状况，他忍受高温钻进去查看，直到问题解决了他才放心。每一个和他接触过的人，都感到他和蔼可亲得像家人一样。他欢迎大家提问题，耐心地把他所知道的全详细地告诉你，直到你完全弄懂为止。他会为任何小的工作改善而热情地鼓励你，但也对一个小错误认真地、诚恳地给以批评并告诉如何去改正。他以深切的热爱处处关心着工人，从繁重工作的机械化，技术安全，劳动保护的设施，以至对最被忽视的场房清洁，工地布置等，都曾作了很多切实可行的建议。
    亚罗申克同志的高贵品质和社会主义管理企业的丰富经验，是我们学习的好榜样。他是我们敬爱的朋友和老师。我们深深体验到在他帮助下的每一成果都是和祖国工业化逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大世界和平力量息息相关的。
    因此，我们决心遵照毛主席的话，努力学习苏联，进一步贯彻专家建议，加强计划管理，逐步推行技术作业过程，组织专业化工段，以提高产品质量、巩固作业均衡性、缩短生产周期、满足国家运输日益增长的需要。
