Editorial: State-Owned Commerce Should Vigorously Improve the Supply of Industrial Goods in Rural Markets

    To vigorously promote industrial products and strengthen the supply of industrial goods to rural markets, in order to cooperate with the task of purchasing grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, is the primary task of state-owned commerce at present, and it is also the central link in the state-owned commercial system's implementation of the increase production and practice economy campaign.

    Since the third quarter, the state-owned commercial system has actively expanded its sources of goods, and commodity inventories have generally increased. In particular, the general merchandise and means of livelihood needed by the people have increased significantly, both in terms of quantity and variety. The total value of commodity inventories in the department store system is now 19.78 percent higher than at the end of last year, and 21.32 percent higher than at the end of the third quarter of this year. Among them, the inventory of commodities such as towels and socks at the end of September has exceeded the total actual sales volume from January to September of this year. The various cotton cloths currently in stock at the China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation are sufficient to fully supply sales needs in the fourth quarter. Among them, the inventory of printed cloth at the end of September this year increased by 131.27 percent compared with the same period last year. The industrial product inventories of other professional companies of state-owned commerce are also sufficient. With the expansion of the scope of processing orders and the vigorous development of the increase production and practice economy campaign in the industrial sector, the source of industrial goods is still increasing day by day. This shows that the state-owned commercial sector has sufficient strength to actively expand the promotion of industrial products. If we do not strengthen sales work today, if we import more goods but cannot sell them quickly, the result will inevitably lead to difficulties in the capital turnover of state-owned commerce itself, and the organization of production work will not be able to proceed smoothly, which will also affect industrial production and the development of the entire increase production and practice economy campaign.

    Strengthening sales work is not only necessary, but also possible. This year, the total grain production in the country will not be lower than last year, and the next few months will be the season when farmers sell large quantities of grain. In addition, the prices of many industrial products have been appropriately reduced this year, and the grain purchase prices have been appropriately increased. The demand for industrial products by farmers will inevitably increase. For example, the total sales value of department stores and cotton cloth in the Central South region in July increased by more than 60 percent compared with the same period last year. Among them, the materials supplied to farmers by Hunan Province during the purchase of grain increased by about 50 percent compared with the same period last year. Sales in other regions have also progressed. This shows that the market for state-owned commerce to promote industrial products is very broad. If we do not actively organize and expand promotion, we will not be able to meet the growing needs of the vast number of farmers, especially the need for farmers to purchase means of production and means of livelihood after selling grain, which will affect the farmers' enthusiasm for production.

    However, the sales work of state-owned commerce recently has not achieved the due results required by the sales plan. The sales plan for the third quarter was only 97.6 percent completed. In October of the fourth quarter, according to the sales ratio, about 34 percent of the quarterly sales plan should have been completed, but only 30.1 percent was actually completed. Especially daily-use department stores, which account for the largest proportion of total sales, only completed 26.69 percent of the quarterly plan. This means that nearly 20 percent of the annual sales task of state-owned commercial departments must be completed in the next two months. Therefore, we must make the greatest efforts and seize the opportunity to do a good job in promoting industrial products.

    The focus of state-owned commerce in organizing the promotion of industrial products should first be placed in rural areas. This is not only to cooperate with the current grain purchase work, but also because the agricultural population, which accounts for more than 80 percent of China's population, is the main market for industrial products in our country. The development of China's industry can only be based on the development and expansion of China's domestic market and the capacity of this market. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The peasants – this is the main body of the Chinese industrial market. Only they can supply the richest grain and raw materials, and absorb the largest amount of industrial products." ("On Coalition Government") Therefore, the view that exists among some commercial cadres at present that they neglect the need to supply rural areas must be quickly corrected. All state-owned commercial workers must attach importance to and actively do a good job in supplying industrial products in rural areas. Of course, while doing a good job in supplying industrial products in rural areas, we should also do a good job in supplying industrial products in cities and industrial and mining areas.

    To do a good job in supplying industrial products in rural areas, we must proceed from reality and from the needs of farmers, which requires a systematic investigation and research on the consumption needs of farmers. Our country has a vast territory, many ethnic groups, and extremely unbalanced economic development. The living habits and purchasing power of residents in various regions are not the same. Only by strengthening investigation and research work can we correctly organize the source of goods, guide production, do a good job in promotion, and meet the needs of farmers. At present, some commercial cadres still have great blindness in organizing the source of goods and material supply. Some people, for fear of out-of-stock, do not ask about the needs of residents, but blindly order more goods, and after entering the goods, they do not actively try to promote them vigorously, but sit on the counter and "wait for customers to come to the door"; some people, for fear of backlog, only want famous brand goods and high-end goods that sell quickly and have high profits, but they do not actively operate on commodities needed by the vast number of farmers. These practices are obviously wrong.

    On the basis of strengthening investigation and research, state-owned commercial departments should strengthen the planning of state-owned commercial departments for the supply of industrial products to rural areas, so as to distribute various commodities as appropriately as possible to appropriate locations according to the actual needs of farmers. In the distribution of commodities, all commodities suitable for rural needs should be given priority to supply to rural areas, in order to fully support and cooperate with the grain purchase work. Commercial workers in cities, on the one hand, should fully recognize the importance of meeting the needs of rural areas for industrial products, overcome departmentalism and local viewpoints, and give strong support to rural areas; on the other hand, they should also prevent the unreasonable phenomenon of blindly transferring commodities suitable for urban sales but not suitable for rural sales to rural areas, resulting in out-of-stock in cities and unsalable in rural areas. In view of the fact that state-owned commercial departments still have the phenomenon of slow commodity turnover, inaccurate planning, inappropriate distribution, and warehouse backlog and out-of-stock in stores, and backlog here and out-of-stock there, it is necessary to strengthen the work of exchanging commodity information and adjust the supply of goods in a timely manner.

    In order to do a good job in supplying industrial daily necessities in rural areas, state-owned commerce must also be good at organizing and giving full play to the strength of various economic components. First of all, it must be closely combined with cooperative commerce, actively and effectively overcome the many shortcomings that still exist in the connection between state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives, maintain close contact with cooperatives on a regular basis, understand the sales and inventory situation of cooperatives, and earnestly implement the preferential policies for cooperative commerce; all commodities that state-owned commercial departments have and are needed by rural areas should be given priority to supply to cooperatives; we can encourage cooperatives to actively take goods and promote sales by inviting cooperative representatives to visit inventories and exchange information, and actively help cooperatives solve the difficulties in supply and marketing work in all aspects. It must be recognized that cooperative commerce has a broad mass base of members in rural areas. The better the connection and cooperation between state-owned commerce and cooperatives, the faster the promotion of industrial products, and the more conducive it is to further developing the urban and rural economy and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Secondly, it is necessary to correctly utilize the positive role of medium and small wholesalers between urban and rural areas and retailers in cities and towns and country fairs, oppose their hoarding and speculation, appropriately supply them with commodities that can be sold, and make them sell at the listed prices stipulated by state-owned companies to serve consumers. Correctly utilizing the positive role of private commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood is an important task for state-owned commerce at present. It must be understood that in the coming period, the medium and small wholesalers between urban and rural areas and the retailers and peddlers in cities and towns and country fairs will still play a certain role in enlivening the urban and rural economy. State-owned commercial departments must strengthen their leadership over them, give play to their positive role, and make them better serve the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

    All employees of the state-owned commercial system should vigorously improve the supply of industrial products to rural areas. Only in this way can we ensure that the country properly completes the grain purchase task and completes and overfulfills the sales task assigned to state-owned commercial departments by the state.

### 国营商业应大力做好农村市场的工业品供应工作

    国营商业应大力做好农村市场的工业品供应工作
    大力推销工业品，加强对农村市场工业品的供应，以配合收购粮食、棉花及油料作物的任务，这是国营商业当前的首要工作，也是国营商业系统贯彻增产节约运动的中心环节。
    第三季度以来，国营商业系统积极扩大了货源，商品库存已普遍增加。特别是人民所需要的一般商品与生活资料，不论在数量上或品种上，都增加很多。百货系统目前商品库存总额比去年年末增加了百分之十九点七八，比今年第三季度末增加了百分之二十一点三二。其中毛巾、袜子等商品九月末的库存量，都已超过了今年一至九月份的实销总量。花纱布公司目前库存的各种棉布，足以充分供应第四季度销售的需要。其中花布今年九月末的库存比去年同期增加了百分之一百三十一点二七。国营商业其他各专业公司的工业品库存也都充足。加以加工订货范围的扩大，工业部门的增产节约运动的蓬勃开展，工业商品的来源还在日益增加。这说明国营商业部门积极扩大工业品的推销已有了足够的力量。如果我们今天不加强销售工作，进货多了但不能很快的卖出，其结果必将招致国营商业本身资金周转的困难，组织生产工作就不可能顺利进行，也就会影响到工业生产、影响到整个增产节约运动的开展。
    加强销售工作不仅是必须的，也是可能的。今年全国粮食总生产量不低于去年，今后几个月又正是农民大量卖粮的季节，加以今年许多工业品价格已适当调低，粮食收购价格又已适当调高，农民对工业品的需要必然会增加。例如中南区七月份百货、棉布的销售总值，就比去年同期增加了百分之六十以上，其中湖南省在收购粮食时供应农民的物资就比去年同期增加了百分之五十左右。其他地区的销售情况也有进展。这说明：国营商业推销工业品的市场是很广阔的，如果不积极组织扩大推销，就不能满足广大农民日益增长的需要，特别是不能满足农民出卖粮食后必须购进生产资料和生活资料的需要，这就会影响到农民的生产积极性。
    但是，国营商业最近以来的销售工作，还没有达到销售计划所要求的应有的成绩。第三季度的销售计划只完成百分之九十七点六，第四季度的十月份，按照销售比例，应该完成季度销售计划的百分之三十四左右，但实际只完成百分之三十点一，尤其是占销售总额比重最大的日用百货，仅完成季度计划的百分之二十六点六九。这就是说，国营商业部门全年的销售任务还有近百分之二十须在今后的两个月内完成。因此必须用最大的努力，抓紧时机把工业品的推销工作做好。
    国营商业组织工业品推销工作的重点，应首先放在农村。这不仅是为了配合当前的购粮工作，而且由于占我国人口百分之八十以上的农业人口乃是我国工业品的主要市场。我国工业的发展只能以我国国内市场的发展与扩大，以及这一市场的容纳量为标准。正如毛主席所指出的：“农民——这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”（“论联合政府”）因此，目前在若干商业干部中存在着的忽视供应农村需要的观点，必须迅速改正。全体国营商业工作人员都必须重视并积极做好农村中的工业品供应工作。当然在做好农村工业品供应工作的同时，也应该做好城市与工矿区工业品的供应工作。
    做好农村中工业品的供应工作，必须从实际出发，从农民的需要出发，这就必须对农民的消费需要进行系统的调查研究。我们国家幅员广大，民族众多，经济发展又极不平衡，各个地区居民的生活习惯，购买力都不尽相同，只有加强调查研究工作，才能正确地组织货源指导生产，才能做好推销工作，才能满足农民的需要。目前有些商业干部，在组织货源和物资供应方面都还存在着很大的盲目性。有些人由于怕脱销，就不问居民的需要，只是盲目地多要货，进了货又不积极设法大力推销，而是坐在柜台上“等客上门”；有些人由于怕积压，只要销得快、利润大的名牌货、高档货，对为广大农民所需要的商品却不积极经营。这些作法显然都是错误的。
    国营商业部门要在加强调查研究的基础上，加强国营商业部门对农村工业品供应工作的计划性，以便根据农民的实际需要，把各种商品尽可能恰当地分配到适当地点。在商品的分配工作中，凡是适合农村需要的商品，应尽先供应农村，以全力支持和配合购粮工作。城市中的商业工作人员，一方面应该充分认识满足农村对工业品需要的重要意义，克服本位主义、局部观点，给农村以有力的支持；另一方面，也要防止把适合城市销售而不适合农村销售的商品盲目地调到农村中去，造成城市脱销而农村又卖不出去的不合理现象。鉴于目前国营商业部门还比较普遍地存在着商品运转迟缓，计划不准确，分配不恰当，以及仓库积压门市脱销、此处积压彼处脱销等现象，因此，必须加强互通商品情报的工作，及时调剂供应货品。
    为做好农村中的工业日用品的供应工作，国营商业还必须善于组织并充分发挥各种经济成分的力量。首先必须与合作社商业紧密结合，积极有效地克服目前国营商业部门与合作社联系上还存在着的许多缺点，与合作社经常保持密切联系，了解合作社销售和存货的情况，切实执行对合作社商业的优待政策；凡国营商业部门有的而又为农村所需要的商品，应优先供应合作社；可通过邀请合作社代表参观库存，互通情况的方法，鼓励合作社积极取货推销，并从各方面积极帮助合作社解决供销工作中的困难。必须认识：合作社商业在农村有广泛的社员群众基础，国营商业和合作社的联系配合越好，工业品的推销也就越快，也就越有利于进一步发展城乡经济，巩固工农联盟。其次，必须正确地利用城乡之间中、小批发商与城市和乡镇、集市零售商的积极作用，反对他们囤积居奇，投机取巧的行为，适当地供应他们能够出售的商品，使之按照国营公司所规定的牌价出售，为消费者服务。正确地利用私营商业有利于国计民生的积极作用，是国营商业目前的一项重要任务。必须了解：在今后一定时期内，我国城乡之间的中、小批发商和城市与乡镇、集市的零售商、摊贩，在活跃城乡经济中，还有着一定程度的作用。国营商业部门必须加强对他们的领导，发挥他们的积极作用，使他们更好地为城乡物资交流服务。
    国营商业系统的全体职工应大力做好农村的工业品供应工作，只有这样，才能保证国家妥善地完成购粮任务，并完成与超额完成国家所给予国营商业部门的销售任务。
