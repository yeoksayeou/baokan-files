The prisoner of war explanation work by the Korean and Chinese side was only resumed on the 16th, and after only one day, it was forced to be interrupted again. The dire state of the POW explanation work cannot but provoke indignation.

The serious crisis suffered by the POW explanation work is because the POWs are under the armed control of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents directed by the United States, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC), due to the shameless threats from the US and the constraints of the Swiss representative, has failed to take effective measures to resolutely stop this. Now, the US special agents can not only openly use violence to prevent POWs from listening to explanations, but they can also decide whether the explanation work can proceed. Recent facts show that the NNRC can only arrange the explanation work in the camps selected by the US special agents and in the manner agreed upon by the agents with the consent of the US special agents. Obviously, under these circumstances, the NNRC is no longer exercising its legitimate duties in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visit Work," but is instead acting in accordance with the will of the US special agents. The ferocity of the US special agents has become so rampant that the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Rules" have been replaced by the arbitrary will of the US special agents. How can the explanation work proceed normally under such circumstances?

The matter is very clear: tolerating the rampage of the US special agents is to tolerate the humiliating burial of the explanation work, and to tolerate the destruction of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This despicable and brutal practice of the United States to undermine the explanation work not only violates the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," but is also a serious crime of destroying the Geneva Conventions. However, the Swiss representative to the NNRC believes that "using force to bring out POWs" from the armed control of US special agents is an act of "violating the Geneva Conventions" and opposes the NNRC taking measures to eliminate the special agents. The Swiss representative has repeatedly stated that if the NNRC takes measures in accordance with the law, he will "withdraw my government's mandate to the Swiss delegation." This serious act of resistance by the Swiss representative is an important reason for the NNRC's state of powerlessness and incompetence, and it is also a great encouragement and indulgence for the destructive activities of the US special agents.

The Swiss representative attempts to portray the NNRC's exercise of its legitimate power to eliminate special agents as a matter of using force against POWs who refuse to listen to explanations. This is clearly a distortion of the facts. The Swiss representative in the NNRC also admitted: "Dissenting POWs, especially those who may request repatriation, have been subjected to violent actions." In his report to the Swiss government, the Swiss representative also admitted: "In fact, murders have occurred in the POW camps, and the victims were probably those POWs who wanted to be repatriated." Although the Swiss representative used vague words such as "possibly" and "probably" in the face of such bloody facts, the essence of the matter has been very clearly demonstrated, which is: our captured personnel are suffering violent actions and murders in the POW camps because they demand repatriation. Here, the Swiss representative's claim of using force against POWs who refuse repatriation is proved to be a complete reversal of black and white and a confusion of right and wrong. Because the fact is not that the POWs refuse repatriation at all, but that the US special agents use violence and murder to prevent their repatriation; the fact is not a matter of using force against the POWs at all, but a matter of taking measures to lift the armed control and threats suffered by the POWs. Anyone who is not harbouring ulterior motives and obliterating the facts can see this truth clearly.

Therefore, it is even more absurd to describe the actions taken against US special agents to maintain the POW explanation work and the POWs' lives, safety, and dignity as an act of "violating the Geneva Conventions." This statement can only be regarded as finding a hiding place for the US special agents' crimes of sabotaging the explanation work and killing people, and can only be regarded as a distortion and intolerable mockery of the Geneva Conventions.

It is not the action of stopping the special agents' atrocities that violates the Geneva Conventions; on the contrary, it is the failure to stop such atrocities that is not allowed by the Geneva Conventions.

Article 13 of the Geneva Conventions stipulates: "Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and shall be regarded as a grave breach of the present Convention." The same article also stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults..." Article 12 stipulates: When prisoners of war are transferred by the Detaining Power to a Receiving Power, "responsibility for the application of the present Convention rests on the Receiving Power while they are in its custody." Now, our captured personnel are under the custody of the NNRC, then the responsibility for implementing the Geneva Conventions on them should obviously be borne by the NNRC. But, have our captured personnel in the POW camps in the eastern sector ever been subjected to the implementation of the Geneva Conventions? Are they not being murdered and subjected to violent actions, as Mr. Swiss Representative has admitted? Then, why does Mr. Swiss Representative, as a member of the NNRC, not stop or not demand that such murder and violence be stopped?

The murder and violence suffered by our captured personnel are certainly the result of the illegal acts of the US special agents, but on the other hand, is it not also precisely the "inaction" of the NNRC, especially Mr. Swiss Representative, in condoning the special agents' atrocities that has caused this?

Article 82 of the Geneva Conventions stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and orders in force in the armed forces of the Detaining Power; the Detaining Power may take judicial or disciplinary measures against any prisoner of war who violates such laws, regulations or orders." In the POW camps under the custody of the NNRC, the most important current laws, regulations, and orders are of course the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Rules" and the orders regarding the arrangement of the explanation work. The fact that everyone sees is that the US special agents who are masquerading as POWs are not only not subject to these laws, rules, and orders, but arbitrarily violate and discard them, and also force the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces to obey their lawless restraint. The entire POW camp system stipulated by the Geneva Conventions has therefore been completely destroyed. However, Mr. Swiss Representative, who pretends to uphold the Geneva Conventions, opposes the NNRC exercising its legitimate power of sanctions against the rampant and lawless special agents in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and the provisions of the Geneva Conventions. Then, what is Mr. Swiss Representative upholding, the Geneva Conventions or the special agents' violent actions and murder atrocities?

This distortion and mockery of the Geneva Conventions is absolutely intolerable. The Geneva Conventions are not a hiding place for the US crimes of undermining the POW explanation work; the Geneva Conventions and the "Terms of Reference" are equally legitimate weapons to sanction the US's despicable crimes. Mr. Swiss Representative cannot stand his ground at all in the face of the solemn Geneva Conventions; on the contrary, the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Conventions powerfully refute the arguments of Mr. Swiss Representative.

All those who truly cherish the Geneva Conventions, all those who truly advocate humanitarianism and love peace, should bravely uphold justice, condemn the crimes of the US, and denounce those who feign goodness, in order to maintain the POW explanation work, maintain the Geneva Conventions and the "Terms of Reference." The NNRC must take effective measures to eliminate the US special agents. The NNRC's taking legal action in this regard will surely be supported by all just mankind.

    不容许以日内瓦公约作为美方罪行的隐蔽所
    高集
    朝中方面的战俘解释工作于十六日恢复进行后，才只一天，就又被迫中断。战俘解释工作所处的这种恶劣状况，是不能不使人们感到愤慨的。
    战俘解释工作遭受到的如此严重的危机，是因为战俘受到了美方所指挥的李、蒋特务的武力控制，而中立国遣返委员会因为受到美方的无耻威胁和瑞士代表的牵制，对此一直没有能够果断地采取有效措施加以制止。现在，美方特务不但可以公然以暴力阻止战俘听取解释，而且他们也可以决定解释工作是否进行。最近的事实显示：中立国遣返委员会只有在美方特务的同意下，向特务选定的营场，用特务同意的解释方式才能安排解释工作。显然，在这种情形下，中立国遣返委员会已经不是按照“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”行使其合法的职责，而是屈从美方特务的意志来办事了。美方特务的凶焰已嚣张到如此地步，“职权范围”和“工作细则”已被美方特务的横暴意志所代替，试问解释工作还有什么可能正常进行呢？
    事情是很明显的：容忍美方特务的横行，就是容忍解释工作被屈辱地埋葬，就是容忍朝鲜停战协定遭受破坏。美方破坏解释工作的这种卑劣残暴的做法，不但违反了“职权范围”的规定而且也是破坏日内瓦公约的严重罪行。但是，中立国遣返委员会的瑞士代表却认为从美方特务的武力控制下“使用武力带出战俘”是“违反日内瓦公约”的行为，而反对中立国遣返委员会采取措施，清除特务。瑞士代表并一再表示，如果中立国遣返委员会依法采取措施的话，他就要“撤回我的政府给瑞士代表团的委任令”。瑞士代表的这种严重的抵制行为，是中立国遣返委员会陷于无权和无能状态的一个重要原因，同时也是对美方特务破坏活动的莫大的鼓励和纵容。
    瑞士代表企图把中立国遣返委员会为清除特务而行使其合法权力的问题，说成是对拒绝听取解释的战俘使用武力的问题。这显然是颠倒事实的。瑞士代表在中立国遣返委员会中也曾承认：“持异见的战俘，特别是那些可能要求遣返的战俘，受到了暴力行动。”瑞士代表在给瑞士政府的报告中，又曾承认：“事实上，俘虏营中是发生过谋杀事件的，被害人大概是那些希望被遣返的俘虏。”尽管瑞士代表在这样血淋淋的罪恶事实上使用了“可能”和“大概”这种含糊的词句，但是问题的实质却已经非常清楚地显示出来了，这就是：我方被俘人员因为要求遣返，正在战俘营中遭受到暴力行动和谋杀暴行。在这里瑞士代表的所谓对拒绝遣返的战俘使用武力的说法，就被证明完全是颠倒黑白，混淆是非的。因为事实根本不是战俘拒绝遣返，而是美方特务以暴力行动和谋杀手段阻止其遣返；事实也根本不是什么对战俘使用武力的问题，而是为了解除战俘所遭受到的武力控制和威胁而采取措施的问题。这个道理是任何并非别有居心和抹杀事实的人都能够看得清楚的。
    因此，把为维护战俘解释工作和战俘的生命安全及尊严而应对美方特务采取的行动，说成是“违反日内瓦公约”的行为，就更其荒谬绝伦了。这种说法只能被认为是给美方特务破坏解释工作、杀人行凶的罪行寻找隐蔽所，只能被认为是对日内瓦公约的歪曲和不可容忍的嘲弄。
    不是制止特务暴行的行动违反日内瓦公约；相反的是，不制止这种暴行，才是日内瓦公约所不允许的。
    日内瓦公约第十三条规定：“拘留国任何不法行为或不行为可致其看管中之战俘死亡或严重危害其健康者须予禁止，并当视为严重破坏本公约之行为。”同条并规定：“战俘亦应在任何时受到保护，尤其免致遭受暴行或恫吓及侮辱……”。第十二条规定：战俘在由拘留国移送给接受国时，“其在接受国看管期间，本公约的实施之责任即由该接受国承担之。”现在，我方被俘人员是在中立国遣返委员会的看管之下，那末，对他们实施日内瓦公约的责任，显然是应该由中立国遣返委员会担承的。但是，在东场里战俘营中的我方被俘人员何曾受到日内瓦公约的实施呢？他们不是如瑞士代表先生所承认的那样，被谋杀并受到暴力行动吗？那末，作为中立国遣返委员会一员的瑞士代表先生，为什么对这种谋杀暴行和暴力行动不加制止或不要求加以制止呢？
    我方被俘人员的被谋杀和受到暴力行动，固然是美方特务的不法行为的结果，但是另一方面难道不也正是中立国遣返委员会，特别是瑞士代表先生纵容特务行凶的“不行为”所造成的吗？
    日内瓦公约第八十二条规定：“战俘应受拘留国武装部队现行法律、规则、及命令之拘束；拘留国对于战俘任何违犯此项法律、规则或命令之行为，得采取司法或纪律上之措施。”在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营场中，最重要的现行法律、规则及命令，当然是“职权范围”和“工作细则”及关于安排解释工作的命令。人人看到的事实是，冒充战俘的美方特务不但不受这些法律、规则及命令的拘束，并任意违犯和加以弃置，而且还强使中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队听从他们的无法无天的拘束。日内瓦公约规定的全部战俘营制度，因此被破坏殆尽了。但是，俨然以维护日内瓦公约自居的瑞士代表先生，却反对中立国遣返委员会按照
  “职权范围”和日内瓦公约的规定对横行不法的特务行使其合法的制裁权力，那末瑞士代表先生维护的究竟是日内瓦公约呢，还是特务的暴力行动和谋杀暴行呢？
    对日内瓦公约的这种歪曲和嘲弄是绝对不能容许的。日内瓦公约不是美方破坏战俘解释工作罪行的隐蔽所；日内瓦公约和“职权范围”同样都是制裁美方卑劣罪行的合法的武器。瑞士代表先生在庄严的日内瓦公约的面前是根本站不住脚的，相反的，日内瓦公约维护人道主义的原则却有力地反驳了瑞士代表先生的论调。
    一切真正爱护日内瓦公约的人们，一切真正主张人道主义并爱好和平的人们，都应当为维护战俘解释工作，维护日内瓦公约及“职权范围”而勇敢地主持正义，谴责美方的罪行，指斥那些假冒为善的人们。中立国遣返委员会必须对美方特务采取有效的措施加以清除。中立国遣返委员会在这方面采取合法行动，必将得到全体正义人类的支持。
