    Absorb Opinions from Construction Departments and User Units to Improve the Quality of Engineering Design
    Editor's Note: The quality of design is often felt more keenly and profoundly by construction departments and user units. To improve the quality of design, design departments should actively solicit opinions from construction departments and user units; at the same time, construction departments and user units should also proactively offer opinions on the design to help design departments learn from experience and improve their work. Comrade Xie Xizhao actively offered opinions to the design department; the Design Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry warmly welcomed Comrade Xie Xizhao's opinions and has already taken some measures to actively collect opinions on the design from construction departments and user units. These practices are very good. We are now publishing Comrade Xie Xizhao's letter and the reply letter from the Design Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry together, hoping that other engineering design departments, construction departments, and user units can also do the same to facilitate the improvement of design work.
    Letter from Reader Xie Xizhao
    Xie Xizhao, technician of the Fushun Mining Bureau Civil Construction Engineering Company, writes: The 1953 standard family dormitory designed by the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has a certain value. It greatly saves design manpower, shortens design time, and the drawings are clear and the instructions are detailed. However, based on my personal experience in construction, this standard design has the following shortcomings:
    First, the idea of economic accounting is not sufficiently implemented in the design. This design uses ceiling panels, but there is no load on the ceiling, and the main function is only to prevent cold and minor leaks from the roof. Therefore, ceiling panels can be completely replaced by sorghum stalks plastered with mud. The original design of the eaves, with brick eaves protruding, will become unstable over time, and a reinforced concrete slab laid around the entire wall requires expensive angle iron. The brick corbel (eave brick) is convex and concave in a comb shape, which makes plastering difficult and time-consuming, resulting in a result that is neither beautiful nor economical. In addition, the design of the stair handrails and balcony railings requires square iron, which is also a difficult material to obtain. The door edges of the plywood doors of the wardrobes can be made of single panels and four-by-five-centimeter square timber, but the design uses double panels and four-and-a-half-by-ten-centimeter square timber, which is also unnecessary.
    Second, there are still many problems in terms of practicality. The entire house structure gives a feeling of closed-off and cramped, lacking a bright and open atmosphere. Even for people living on the ground floor, if they want to get from outside to their bedroom, they must first knock on the front door, go through the narrow staircase door, then open the door to the aisle, and walk through the dark aisle, turning corners to reach the bedroom door. If you want the corridor to have more light, the kitchen door should be changed to a half-glass door, which would be better.
    The kitchen and toilet are connected. If the sewer fails or the water pressure is insufficient, the toilet odor will go straight to the kitchen; and this situation is often unavoidable. Most importantly, it first makes people feel mentally uncomfortable. The kitchen cannot directly reach the outside, which makes cleaning up garbage and transporting coal, grain, oil, and salt much more troublesome. The toilet also has no urinal and is difficult to ventilate and very dark.
    Third, the design of civil engineering equipment is disjointed from the design of ancillary equipment. For example, section drawing number 271 does not show the heating trench, nor does it indicate where the section is taken, whether it is a longitudinal section or a transverse section. If construction is carried out according to the drawing, the floor joists will fall into the heating trench. Also, on elevation drawings numbers 5 to 9 and 10 to 31, the location of the sewage vent pipe on the roof is not shown. This shows that there are disconnections in the design.
    Reply Letter from the Design Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Letter from the Design Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry: Comrade Xie Xizhao's opinions are basically correct. The standard dormitory for the Northeast region designed by our Design Company this year indeed failed to fully implement the idea of economic accounting in many places; in some places, the design is even unreasonable. For example, the Type A bachelor dormitory has too many staircases, wasting building area and building materials. There are also many problems in the use of construction drawings and materials that have not been carefully considered, resulting in difficulties in construction and use.
    In order to thoroughly examine the problems existing in the design, our Design Company established a visiting group in mid-August to collect problems in various projects designed by the company this year from construction sites and user units. So far, many opinions have been collected, most of which are very valuable. The company also sent a working group to be stationed at the Angang Workers' Village site in May as a key point, to promptly notify the units using the design drawings of the design problems found during the construction of the standard dormitory, so that they could be modified. However, because our contact surface is limited, we urgently hope that relevant units can, like Comrade Xie Xizhao, actively offer opinions on the design of our Design Company to help us improve our future design work.
    Regarding the location of the kitchen and toilet raised by Comrade Xie Xizhao, we have repeatedly studied it over the years. Because modifications would require increasing the area, adding corridors, and affecting the amount of investment too much; and these shortcomings are not very serious, so we have not modified them. We hope that all parties can also help us find a satisfactory solution to this problem.

### 吸收施工部门和使用单位的意见  改进工程设计的质量

    吸收施工部门和使用单位的意见
    改进工程设计的质量
    编者按：设计质量的好坏，在施工部门和使用单位往往感觉得更加敏锐和深切。为了改进设计的质量，设计部门应主动征求施工部门和使用单位的意见；同时，施工部门和使用单位也应主动对设计提出意见，以帮助设计部门吸取教训，改进工作。谢犀照同志主动地对设计部门提出意见；中央重工业部设计司对谢犀照同志的意见采取了热烈欢迎的态度，并且已经采取了一些办法，主动搜集施工部门和使用单位对设计的意见。这些做法都是很好的。现在我们把谢犀照同志的来信和中央重工业部设计司的答复信一并发表于后，希望其他工程的设计部门、施工部门和使用单位也能这样做，以利于改进设计工作。
    读者谢犀照的来信
    抚顺矿务局土木建筑工程公司技术员谢犀照来信：中央重工业部设计公司设计的一九五三年标准家属宿舍，是有一定价值的。它大大节省了设计力量，缩短了设计时间，图纸清晰，说明详尽。然而，就我个人在施工中的体会，这个标准设计有着以下几个缺点：
    第一，设计中经济核算思想贯彻得不够。这个设计采用了天棚板，而天棚上没有任何荷重，主要作用不过是防寒及防止房屋上轻微的渗漏。因此，天棚板完全可以用秫秸抹大泥来代替。原设计的屋檐，砖檐敷出，年代一久就不稳固，而环墙一周，满铺钢筋混凝土版，需要用价值高昂的角钢。砖斗拱（檐头砖）凸凹作栉齿形，抹灰困难，旷日费时，结果既不美观，又不经济。此外，楼梯扶手、阳台栏杆的设计要用方铁，也是不易得到的材料。衣柜胶合板门的门边，本来用单面板、用四公分乘五公分的方材就可以，但设计中用了双面板，并用四点五公分乘十公分的方材，这也是不必要的。
    第二，在实用上还有不少问题。整个房屋构造令人产生一种闭塞局促的感觉，缺乏明朗开放的气氛。即使住在底层的人，如果从室外到他的寝室，首先要叩开大门，经过狭窄的楼梯间的门，再打开甬道的门，穿过黑暗的甬道，转弯抹角才能达到寝室的门口。如果希望走廊光线充足一些，应该把厨房门改为半截玻璃门，多少要好一些。
    厨房和便所是连在一起，如果一旦下水道发生故障，或水压不足，便所臭气便会直奔厨房；而这种情况往往是不可避免的。最重要的是，首先使人精神上感到不快。厨房不能直到室外，这就使清扫垃圾和煤粮油盐的运输增加了不少麻烦。便所又没有小便处，且通风困难，非常黑暗。
    第三，土木建筑设备设计与附属设备设计脱节。例如二百七十一号剖面图没有画出暖气沟，也没有标出从什么地方剖，是纵剖还是横剖。要是按图施工的话，地楞早就掉暖气沟里了。又如五至九号剖面图及十至三十一号的立面图上，没有画出下水气塔在屋面的位置。这就表明设计是有脱节现象的。
    中央重工业部设计司的答复信
    中央重工业部设计司来信：谢犀照同志的意见基本上是正确的。我部设计公司今年所设计的东北区标准宿舍，确实有很多地方未能很好地贯彻经济核算思想；甚至有些地方是设计得不合理的。例如：甲型独身宿舍中楼梯过多，浪费了建筑面积和建筑材料。在施工图和材料的采用上更有很多问题未经慎重考虑，以致造成了施工和使用上的困难。
    为了深入检查设计中存在的问题，我部设计公司从八月中旬起，曾成立访问小组，去施工现场及使用单位搜集该公司今年所设计各项工程中的问题。至目前为止，已搜集了很多意见，其中大部分是十分可贵的。该公司并于五月份起重点派出工作小组常驻鞍钢工人村现场，将标准宿舍施工中所发现的设计问题及时通知各采用该设计图的单位，以便进行修改。但由于我们的接触面有限，因此亟望各有关单位能如谢犀照同志一样，积极地对我部设计公司的设计多多提出意见，帮助我们改进今后的设计工作。
    谢犀照同志所提出的厨房与厕所的位置问题，几年来我们曾一再研究。由于修改后需要增大面积，增加走廊，影响投资额过大；而这些缺点还不是十分严重的，因此就没有加以修改。希望各方面也能帮助我们对这个问题找出圆满的解决办法。
