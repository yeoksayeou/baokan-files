    Consolidating the Worker-Peasant Alliance by Implementing the General Line
    Guo Xiaochuan, Chen Zheran
    I. What is the Worker-Peasant Alliance?
    What is the worker-peasant alliance? Perhaps some would say: the unity and mutual assistance of workers and peasants is the worker-peasant alliance. This is certainly correct, but not entirely complete. First, the worker-peasant alliance must have a purpose. During the transition period, the purpose of the worker-peasant alliance is to transition to socialism. Second, the worker-peasant alliance must have a leader, and that is the working class represented by the Communist Party. Without the leadership of the working class, the transition to socialism cannot be achieved. Therefore, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our worker-peasant alliance has been an alliance led by the working class, with workers and peasants united and helping each other, striving to transition to socialism.
    Why should the working class lead the transition to socialism? This is mainly because the working class represents the most advanced and promising method of production – large-scale production. In the booklet "How to Be a Good Communist" compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, it is said: "The working class is different from small individual laborers in that they do not have privately owned means of production; they work in factories, cooperate in division of labor, use machines, and engage in collective production. In such large-scale production, workers develop habits of unity, mutual assistance, organization, and discipline. They have a broad vision, a selfless spirit, and the desire to realize communism. Based on the interests of the working class, they must help all oppressed and exploited masses to achieve liberation; because only by eliminating all systems of exploitation can the thorough liberation of the working class itself be realized. Therefore, only the working class can unite all oppressed and exploited masses around itself and advance towards socialism and communism through the necessary revolutionary path." Peasants can walk towards socialism together with the working class (the Soviet peasants are an example), but before production is collectivized, they are limited by backward production methods and cannot avoid their own class differentiation. Individual peasants are laborers on the one hand, so the vast majority of them can voluntarily go to socialism with the working class through education; but on the other hand, they are also private owners, they own land, farm tools, livestock... these means of production, so some of them will often use ways of exploiting people such as employing workers, lending money, and doing speculative business to make personal fortunes. If the working class does not lead the peasants on the socialist road and help them change their production methods, the peasants will spontaneously take the capitalist road. Therefore, the worker-peasant alliance must be led by the working class.
    Such an alliance is the foundation of our country and the guarantee of our country's transition to socialism. Peasants are the most numerous laboring masses, and agricultural labor is absolutely indispensable to any society. Without the cooperation of the vast number of peasants, the working class alone cannot achieve industrialization and socialist transformation. Without the cooperation of the peasants, there would be no grain and many industrial raw materials, and there would be no main sales market for industrial products, then industrialization could not be realized; without the cooperation of the peasants, if hundreds of millions of peasants are unwilling to take the socialist road, then socialist transformation cannot be realized. Therefore, to implement the general line of the state during the transition period, it is necessary to greatly consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.
    II. How to Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance
    So, how to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance?
    First, to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is necessary to strive to develop industry, because only industry can provide peasants with various new-style farm tools (and in the future, agricultural machinery and electricity), new-style fertilizers, pesticides, and other means of production to transform agriculture and promote the collectivization of agriculture; and only industry can provide peasants with various daily industrial products and exchange them for various agricultural products, so as to make agriculture prosperous.
    Second, to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is necessary to mobilize peasants to organize, take the socialist road of mutual assistance and cooperation in production, consumption, and credit, and integrate them with the socialist economy of the country, and give peasants participating in cooperatives various material assistance, so that peasants can recognize the benefits of collectivization, so as to gradually block the capitalist road in the countryside that destroys the worker-peasant alliance.
    Third, to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is necessary to restrict the activities of capitalist elements (rich peasants, usurers, speculative merchants) in the countryside, and prevent the development of spontaneous capitalist tendencies among peasants. Otherwise, if capitalism develops in the countryside, the worker-peasant alliance cannot be consolidated.
    Fourth, to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is necessary to seriously value the peasants' consciousness and voluntariness, and earnestly take care of the peasants' interests. Leading the peasants to advance towards socialism must adopt the method of persuasion and education, rely on the consciousness and voluntariness of the laboring peasants, and strictly oppose coercion and commandism. It is necessary to ensure that peasants truly see the interests of the worker-peasant alliance and socialism to the peasants, which not only requires helping peasants to develop production, but also requires correct price policies, so that peasants do not suffer losses when selling agricultural products and buying industrial products, as well as when dealing with the state. Failure to pay attention to the peasants' interests and consciousness and voluntariness will prevent the worker-peasant alliance from being consolidated.
    Fifth, to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, it is necessary to strengthen the education of the worker-peasant alliance among workers and peasants, especially to strengthen the work of the Communist Party in the countryside. The rural Party organization is the fortress of the working-class vanguard in the countryside. Party members in the countryside should faithfully implement the Party's various policies and instructions in the countryside, closely contact the broad masses of laboring peasants, serve the progress and happiness of the peasants, and constantly improve the consciousness of the peasant masses, and consolidate the peasants' belief in the Party and the worker-peasant alliance. To this end, Party members should actively promote socialism to the peasants, promote the worker-peasant alliance, eliminate misunderstandings about socialism and the worker-peasant alliance among the peasants, and play an exemplary role in labor and work. Some Party members still live the life of peasants themselves, and inevitably have peasant thoughts. Some Party members also have other bad styles, then they must work hard to study and transform their thoughts and styles, so as to become glorious fighters of the working-class vanguard and become the core of uniting and leading the broad masses of laboring peasants in the countryside to implement the general line.
    III. The Glorious Responsibility of Peasants for the Worker-Peasant Alliance
    Who is responsible for the tasks of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance mentioned above? Of course, the Communist Party and the working class must first be responsible, and the people's government led by the Communist Party and the working class must be responsible, but at the same time, the broad masses of peasants must also be responsible. Without the leadership of the working class, it will not work; without the efforts of hundreds of millions of peasants, it will not work either.
    So, what is the responsibility of the peasants?
    First, peasants must produce more grain, cotton, oilseeds, and other various agricultural products, and breed more cattle, horses, donkeys, pigs, sheep, chickens, and other livestock to meet the needs of industrial development and the development of the entire economy. The various grains and various non-staple foods (oils, vegetables, meats, etc.) needed by workers and the urban population that increases with industrial development are increasing more and more, and the cotton and other raw materials needed by industry are also increasing more and more. Peasants' efforts to expand the production of these things are supporting the general line of industrialization and supporting the worker-peasant alliance.
    Second, the things produced by the peasants, especially grain and cotton, in addition to their own needs, must be sold to the state according to the needs of the state and at reasonable prices stipulated by the state. The peasants' surplus products can only be used for construction if they are sold to the state, and that is called supporting the general line; if the peasants hoard them themselves to make money by doing high-priced transactions, or sell them to merchants for speculative profiteering, then the peasants will not only have no help for the country's construction, but will also play a destructive role. Moreover, if this is done, peasants with surplus grain will use the grain in their hands to exploit peasants who lack grain, and a very small number of peasants will gradually become rich peasant exploiters, and the vast majority of peasants will become poorer and poorer day by day. In this way, not only can industry not develop (peasants are too poor to buy industrial products), but agriculture cannot develop either (peasants are too poor to invest in agriculture); not only is the worker-peasant alliance destroyed, but even the unity of the laboring peasants themselves is destroyed.
    Third, under the leadership of the Communist Party, peasants must strive to develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, establish more agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives, move more in the direction of socialism, integrate more with the socialist economy, and oppose the development of capitalism in the countryside. The better agricultural collectivization develops, the more difficult it is for capitalism to operate, and the more consolidated the worker-peasant alliance becomes.
    The working class is now working hard to build and produce in the cities, handing over the produced things to the state and supplying them to the countryside at reasonable prices, helping the countryside to embark on the happy road of socialism; and the peasants are working hard to produce in the countryside, handing over the produced things to the state and supplying them to the cities at reasonable prices, helping the cities to develop socialist industrial construction: helping each other and uniting each other in this way, the worker-peasant alliance will definitely become more and more consolidated day by day, the country will definitely become richer and stronger day by day, the general line will definitely be victorious, and socialist construction will definitely be successful.
    IV. Dispel Misunderstandings about the Worker-Peasant Alliance
    At present, some people in the countryside still have some misunderstandings about the worker-peasant alliance, which hinders the worker-peasant alliance, and we must eliminate it.
    Some people say: "The Communist Party is the party of the working class, cares for workers, and does not care for peasants." This is completely wrong. It is precisely because the Communist Party is the party of the working class that it can care for the peasants and strive for the liberation and happiness of the peasants. For thirty years, the Communist Party has been leading the peasants in revolution. After the victory, it immediately implemented land reform throughout the country, and more than 300 million landless and land-poor peasants across the country were allocated 700 million mu of land. After the land reform, the state also helped peasants build large-scale farmland water conservancy; issued nearly 10 trillion yuan of agricultural loans; and the state's trading companies and cooperatives sold a large number of agricultural products and local specialties and by-products for peasants at reasonable prices. On the one hand, agricultural products are more valuable than before, and on the other hand, many industrial products are cheaper than before, and there are more types and better quality. These facts all prove that the party of the working class and the government led by the working class care for the peasants, and many of them are the direct result of the hard work of the working class. In the future, the Communist Party and the working class will also make Chinese peasants as happy as today's Soviet peasants. Therefore, there is no reason to say that the Communist Party and the working class do not care for the peasants.
    Some people say: "The life of workers is much better than that of peasants." This is also wrong. After liberation, the lives of workers and peasants have improved, but the country is still just starting to build, and greater improvements in life must come step by step with the development of production. Workers' salaries seem to be a lot, but it is not much to support the whole family. Workers do not farm or grow vegetables, and everything they eat and use has to be bought with money. They do not have side jobs, they have to pay rent for housing, and they have to spend money on transportation to and from work, so their expenses are very large, not like living in the countryside. Of course, the lives of some workers are slightly better than those of peasants, which is also appropriate. Because, first, workers produce more than peasants. According to the statistics of a machine factory in Taiyuan, the things produced by a worker in a year are worth 30,000 to 40,000 catties of millet, but at present, a peasant can produce at most 2,000 catties of millet a year, that is to say, the production of a worker is equal to fifteen to twenty peasants. Furthermore, in terms of contribution to the country, workers also contribute more than peasants. In 1952, state-owned factories, mines, trading companies, and cooperatives (with a total of only more than 4 million employees) handed over taxes and profits to the state, accounting for 56.33 percent of the state's total income, and will account for more in the future; however, the public grain paid by the country's peasants (a total of 480 million people, which is 100 times more than workers) in this year only accounted for 17.8 percent of the state's total income, and will account for less in the future. Second, workers' income does not come from peasants. They have given a reasonable price for eating the peasants' grain, and have not taken advantage of it at all. The remuneration workers receive is obtained through their own labor; and what workers get is only a very small part of the value they produce, while what peasants get is the vast majority of what they produce. Third, most workers have to work hard for many years to learn the technology well; workers have no free time throughout the year, and many workers have to work at night, which is not like peasants who have slack seasons; many workers' jobs are very heavy, some are constantly roasted by the furnace and cannot breathe, some jobs are very dangerous and easily injure people, and it is impossible to support themselves if their lives are not better. Therefore, it is not inappropriate for a part of the workers to have slightly more income than the peasants now. The reason why peasants' current income is low is that they suffer from backward production methods. To thoroughly improve the lives of peasants, it is necessary to implement national industrialization and agricultural collectivization. When these two steps are achieved, rural life can be gradually improved to be similar to that of cities. Workers and peasants should strive for this goal.
    Some people ask: "Does the development of industry exploit the peasants?" This suspicion is also unfounded. First, as already mentioned, more than half of our country's fiscal revenue is accumulated by the state-owned economy itself, and industrial funds also come from this, not from agricultural tax. Second, as already mentioned, the prices of many industrial products are cheaper than before liberation, but agricultural products are more valuable than before liberation. Therefore, the development of industry does not make peasants suffer at all. On the contrary, industrial development will only bring various benefits to peasants, such as stimulating agricultural development, supplying peasants with new-style means of production and means of subsistence, building water conservancy projects, developing transportation and urban-rural exchanges, lowering the prices of industrial products, and increasing the state's strength to help peasants, etc.
    Some people also say: "To implement socialist transformation, it is necessary to restrict the four major freedoms (that is, the freedom to hire workers, the freedom to rent and buy and sell land, the freedom to borrow and lend, and the freedom to trade), which will打击 (dǎjī) the peasants' enthusiasm for production. How can the worker-peasant alliance be consolidated?" This is also completely wrong. Freedom and enthusiasm must be analyzed to see whether it is the freedom and enthusiasm to develop capitalism or the freedom and enthusiasm to develop socialism. The former freedom and enthusiasm are detrimental to the majority of peasants and the worker-peasant alliance, while the latter freedom and enthusiasm are beneficial to the majority of peasants and the worker-peasant alliance. The freedom to hire workers, rent and buy and sell land, lend money, and do business is of course not prohibited, but restriction is necessary. If there is no restriction at all, the result is only to guarantee the enthusiasm of capitalism, only to guarantee the freedom of a few rich peasants, usurers, and speculative merchants to exploit the majority of peasants and the majority of peasants to be exploited, and does not guarantee the peasants' enthusiasm for developing mutual aid and cooperation and the freedom of all peasants to become rich together, let alone guarantee the enthusiasm of the worker-peasant alliance to jointly realize socialist industrialization, and the freedom to realize socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industrial and commercial enterprises. To implement socialist transformation and restrict the freedom of capitalist development, the majority of peasants not only do not suffer losses, but their interests are also guaranteed. Therefore, in order to truly care for the peasants, it is necessary to help poor peasants overcome difficulties, so that they do not sell land, do not borrow high-interest loans, and do not work as hired laborers for rich peasants; use mutual aid and cooperation methods to help peasants develop production, do not take the capitalist road, and educate peasants not to sell grain and other important agricultural products to private merchants. Only in this way can the peasants' enthusiasm for going to socialism and the freedom to get rid of poverty be guaranteed, can the country's industrialization be helped, and can the worker-peasant alliance be consolidated.

    实行总路线要巩固工农联盟
    郭小川　陈泽然
    一、什么是工农联盟
    什么是工农联盟？也许有人说：工人和农民团结互助，就是工农联盟。这话当然不错，不过还不完全。第一，工农联盟要有目的。在过渡时期内，工农联盟的目的是过渡到社会主义。第二，工农联盟要有领导者，这就是共产党所代表的工人阶级。没有工人阶级的领导，就不能过渡到社会主义。所以，从中华人民共和国成立以后，我国的工农联盟就是工人阶级领导的、工人阶级和农民团结互助、为过渡到社会主义而斗争的联盟。
    过渡到社会主义，为什么要由工人阶级来领导呢？这主要地是因为工人阶级代表着最进步的最有发展前途的生产方法——大生产。在中共中央宣传部编的小册子“怎样做一个共产党员”里面说：“工人阶级和个体劳动的小生产者不一样，他们没有个人私有的生产资料；他们集中在工厂里做工，合作分工，使用机器，集体地进行生产。在这样的大生产中，养成了工人们团结、互助、有组织、有纪律的习惯。他们眼光远大，具有大公无私的精神和实现共产主义的要求。根据工人阶级的利益，他们必须帮助一切被压迫被剥削的群众获得解放；因为只有消灭一切剥削制度，工人阶级自己的彻底解放也才能实现。所以，只有工人阶级能够把一切被压迫被剥削的群众团结在自己的周围，经过必要的革命道路，向着社会主义和共产主义前进。”农民是可以和工人阶级一道走向社会主义的（苏联农民就是榜样），但是在生产没有合作化之前，他们受了生产方法落后的限制，却不能避免本身的阶级分化。个体农民一方面是劳动者，所以他们的绝大多数可以经过教育自愿和工人阶级一起走到社会主义去；可是另方面他们又是私有者，他们占有土地、农具、牲口……这些生产资料，所以他们中间经常会有一部分人用雇工、放债、做投机生意等等剥削人的办法来作私人发财的打算。工人阶级如果不带领农民走社会主义的路，并且帮助农民改变生产方法，农民就会自发地走资本主义的路。所以工农联盟一定要由工人阶级来领导。
    这样的联盟，就是我们国家的基础，是我国过渡到社会主义的保证。农民是人数最多的劳动群众，农业劳动是任何社会所绝对不可缺少的，没有广大农民的合作，单是工人阶级是不可能实现工业化和社会主义改造的。要没有农民的合作，就没有粮食和许多工业原料，就没有工业品的主要销售市场，那就不能实现工业化；要没有农民的合作，几万万农民不愿意走社会主义的路，那就不能实现社会主义改造。所以要实行国家在过渡时期的总路线，就要大大地巩固工农联盟。
    二、怎样巩固工农联盟
    那么，怎样巩固工农联盟呢？
    第一、要巩固工农联盟，就要努力发展工业，因为只有工业才能供给农民各种新式农具（将来还要供给农业机器和电力）、新式肥料、农药等生产资料，改造农业，促进农业的集体化；并且只有工业才能供给农民各种日用工业品，和农民交换各种农产品，使农业繁荣起来。
    第二、要巩固工农联盟，就要发动农民组织起来，在生产、消费、信贷各方面都走互助合作的社会主义道路，都和国家的社会主义的经济相结合，并且给参加合作社的农民以各种物质上的帮助，使农民认识到合作化的利益，这样来逐渐堵死农村中的破坏工农联盟的资本主义道路。
    第三、要巩固工农联盟，就要限制资本主义分子（富农、高利贷者、投机商人）在农村中的活动，防止农民中的自发的资本主义倾向的发展。不然，资本主义在农村中发展了，工农联盟就不能巩固。
    第四、要巩固工农联盟，就要认真地重视农民的自觉自愿，并且认真地照顾农民的利益。领导农民向社会主义前进，必须采取说服教育的方法，依靠劳动农民的自觉自愿，严格反对强迫命令。必须要使农民确实看到工农联盟和社会主义对农民的利益，这就不但要帮助农民发展生产，还要有正确的价格政策，使农民在卖农产品买工业品的时候以及其他跟国家打交道的时候不吃亏。不注意农民的利益和自觉自愿，工农联盟就不能巩固。
    第五、要巩固工农联盟，就要加强在工人和农民中间的工农联盟教育，特别是要加强农村中的共产党的工作。农村党的组织是工人阶级先锋队在农村的堡垒，农村中的党员应当忠实地执行党在农村中的各项政策和指示，密切地联系广大的劳动农民群众，为农民的进步和幸福服务，并且不断地提高农民群众的觉悟，巩固农民对党和工农联盟的信仰。为此目的，党员就应当积极向农民宣传社会主义，宣传工农联盟，破除农民中对社会主义和工农联盟的误解，并且在劳动中工作中起模范带头作用。有些党员自己还过着农民生活，难免有农民思想，有些党员还有其他不好的作风，那就一定要努力学习，改造自己的思想和作风，使自己成为工人阶级先锋队的光荣战士，成为在农村中团结领导广大劳动农民实行总路线的核心。
    三、农民对于工农联盟的光荣责任
    前面说的巩固工农联盟的任务，靠谁来担当呢？当然首先要靠共产党和工人阶级来担当，靠共产党和工人阶级领导的人民政府来担当，可是同时也得靠广大的农民来担当。没有工人阶级来领导是不行的，没有几万万农民的努力也是不行的。
    那么，农民的责任是什么呢？
    第一、农民要多生产粮食、棉花、油料和其他各种农产品，多繁殖牛、马、驴、猪、羊、鸡等各种牲畜，来满足工业发展和整个经济发展的需要。工人和随工业发展而增加的城市人口需要的各种粮食和各种副食品（油类、蔬菜类、肉类等等）越来越增加，工业所需要的棉花和其他原料也越来越增加，农民努力扩大这些东西的生产，就是拥护工业化的总路线，就是拥护工农联盟。
    第二、农民生产出来的东西，特别是粮食棉花一类，除了自己需用以外，一定要按国家的需要，照国家规定的合理价格卖给国家。农民的多余的生产品只有卖给国家，才能用在建设上，才叫拥护总路线；要是农民自己囤起来高价做买卖赚钱，或者卖给商人，让商人拿去投机倒把；那么，农民对国家的建设不但没有什么帮助，反而起了破坏的作用。并且，要是这样做，余粮多的农民就要利用手里的粮食来盘剥缺粮的农民，极少数的农民就会一步一步变成富农剥削者，极大多数的农民就会一天一天穷困下去。这样不但工业不能发展（农民穷了就买不起工业品），农业也不能发展（农民穷了就不能在农业上投资）；不但破坏了工农联盟，连劳动农民本身的团结也破坏了。
    第三、农民要在共产党的领导下，努力发展互助合作运动，多办农业生产合作社、供销合作社、信贷合作社，多向社会主义方向前进，多同社会主义经济结合，反对资本主义在农村的发展。农业合作化发展得越好，资本主义就越难活动，工农联盟就越加巩固。
    工人阶级现在正在城市里努力建设，努力生产，把生产的东西交给国家用合理的价格供给农村，帮助农村走向社会主义的幸福道路；农民又在农村里努力生产，把生产的东西交给国家用合理的价格供给城市，帮助城市发展社会主义的工业建设：这样互相帮助，互相团结，工农联盟一定一天比一天巩固，国家一定一天比一天富强，总路线一定可以胜利，社会主义建设一定可以成功。
    四、打消对工农联盟的误解
    目前在农村中有些人对工农联盟还有一些误解，这是妨碍工农联盟的，我们必须把它消除。
    有人说：“共产党是工人阶级的党，爱护工人，不爱护农民。”这话是完全不对的。正因为共产党是工人阶级的党，所以才能爱护农民，才能为农民谋解放，谋幸福。三十年来，共产党一直领导农民闹革命。得到胜利以后，马上在全国实行土地改革，使全国三万万多的无地少地的农民，分到了七万万亩的土地。土地改革以后，国家又帮助农民大修农田水利；发放了近十万亿元的农业贷款；国家的贸易公司和合作社又用合理的价格替农民销出大批农产品和土特副产品。一方面农产品比以前值钱了，一方面许多工业品却比以前便宜了，种类又多，质量又好。这些事实都证明工人阶级的党和工人阶级领导的政府是爱护农民的，并且其中有许多还是工人阶级艰苦劳动的直接结果。到了将来，共产党和工人阶级还要使中国农民和今天的苏联农民一样地幸福。所以，说共产党和工人阶级不爱护农民的话，是没有道理的。
    有人说：“工人的生活比农民好得太多了。”这话也不对。解放以后，工农生活都有改善，但是国家还在刚刚建设，生活的更大的改善还得跟着生产的发展一步一步来。工人的薪资，看起来很多，可是要养活全家，也就不算多了。工人不种地，也不种菜，吃的用的样样都要用钱买，又没有副业，住房子还得出租钱，上工下工还要花车钱，所以开销很大，不比在乡下住。当然，一部分工人比农民生活稍好一些，这也是应当的。因为，第一、工人生产的东西比农民多。据太原一个机器工厂的统计，一个工人一年生产出来的东西值三万斤到四万斤小米，但目前一个农民一年至多只能生产两千斤小米，就是说，一个工人的生产等于十五个到二十个农民。再拿对国家的贡献来说，工人也比农民多的多。一九五二年国营工厂、矿山、贸易公司、合作社（一共只有职工四百多万人）交给国家的税款和利润，就占了国家全部收入的百分之五十六点三三，并且以后还要占得多些；可是全国农民（一共有四万万八千万人，就是比工人多一百倍）在这一年缴纳的公粮却只占国家全部收入的百分之十七点八，并且以后还要占得少些。第二、工人的收入并不是从农民那里来的，吃农民的粮食都给了合理的代价，一点也没有占便宜。工人得到的报酬，都是用自己的劳动取得的；而且工人所得的只是自己生产的价值中的很小的一部分，农民所得的却是自己生产的东西的绝大部分。第三、多数工人要艰苦努力好多年，才能学好技术；工人一年四季没有闲忙，有很多工人要黑夜做活，不比农民有农闲；很多工人的活非常重，有的成天在火炉旁边烤得喘不上气，有的活很危险，容易伤人，生活不好一些就支持不了。所以现在一部分工人比农民的收入稍多一些，并不是不应该的。农民现在的收入少，是吃生产方法落后的亏。农民的生活要彻底改善，就要实行国家工业化和农业集体化，做到了这两步，农村的生活就能够逐渐改善得和城市差不多。工人农民都应当为这个目的而奋斗。
    有人问：“发展工业是不是剥削了农民呢？”这种怀疑也是没有根据的。第一、前面已经说，我国财政收入有多一半是国营经济自己积累的，工业资金也就从这里面出，并不是从农业税出。第二、前面也已经说，许多工业品的价格比解放以前便宜了，农产品却比解放以前值钱了。所以发展工业完全没有叫农民吃亏。相反，工业发展只会让农民得到种种好处，例如刺激农业发展，供给农民新式的生产资料和生活资料，兴修水利，发展交通运输和城乡交流，降低工业品价格，增加国家帮助农民的力量等等。
    又有人说：“实行社会主义改造，就要限制四大自由（即雇工自由、土地租佃买卖自由、借贷自由、贸易自由），这样就要打击农民的生产积极性，怎么还能巩固工农联盟呢？”这话也是完全不对的。自由和积极性都要分析一下，究竟是发展资本主义的自由和积极性呢，还是发展社会主义的自由和积极性呢？前一种自由和积极性是对大多数农民和工农联盟不利的，后一种自由和积极性才是对大多数农民和工农联盟有利的。雇工、土地租佃买卖、放债、做生意这些自由当然不受禁止，但是限制是必要的，如果毫不限制，结果就只是保障了资本主义的积极性，只是保障了少数富农、高利贷者、投机商人剥削多数农民和多数农民受剥削的自由，并没有保障农民发展互助合作的积极性和全体农民大家富裕的自由，更没有保障工农联盟共同实现社会主义工业化的积极性，和对农业、手工业、私营工商业，实现社会主义改造的自由。实行社会主义改造，限制资本主义发展的自由，大多数农民不但不吃亏，而且他们的利益还得到了保障。所以为了真正爱护农民，就要帮助贫苦农民克服困难，使他们不卖地、不借高利贷、不给富农做雇工；用互助合作的办法来帮助农民发展生产，不走资本主义的路，并且教育农民不把粮食和其他重要农产品卖给私商。只有这样，才能保障农民走向社会主义的积极性和摆脱贫困的自由，才能帮助国家工业化，才能巩固工农联盟。
