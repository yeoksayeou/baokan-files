    Units under the Northwest Trading Company, in coordination with planned industrial construction, are vigorously supplying goods needed by workers in mining areas and basic construction sites to facilitate their purchases, thereby meeting their needs. For example, the Yumen mining area is far from the city, making it inconvenient for miners to buy things. Based on the miners' demands and its own capabilities, the trading company has established department stores, stationery shops, vegetable markets, pharmacies, and various workshops, and regularly sends people to Xi'an, Lanzhou, Jiuquan, and other places for purchasing. In the past two months, the number of goods has increased even more, with 480 new varieties of textiles, general merchandise, non-staple foods, and Chinese and Western medicines added. In October 1952, it only handled 880 varieties; now it has increased to more than 2,500. The company adjusted the prices of some commodities that were previously unreasonably priced, starting in August. With abundant supplies and more reasonable prices, the third-quarter sales plan was exceeded by 10.55 percent, an increase of 24 percent compared to the second quarter. The Dushanzi mining area trade store in Xinjiang learned from the advanced experiences of other regions and adopted a two-shift system, with daily business hours from 8:30 am to 10:00 pm, so that employees can still buy things after work. The sales task for the first half of this year was completed ahead of schedule, with each person's work exceeding the amount stipulated by the Xinjiang Provincial Company by 106.92 percent.
    In order to adhere to the policy of "facing factories and mines, cooperating with production, and ensuring supply," trade companies in various places have also dispatched personnel to organize mobile trade teams, carrying goods to conduct mobile trade in mining areas and basic construction sites. For example, since April of this year, the Xi'an Trading Company has organized three mobile teams to sell goods back and forth at various basic construction sites in the suburbs. The Nanzheng Yangping Trade Store in southern Shaanxi organized a mobile team to supply workers with materials at the Tiancheng Road construction site. The director of the Xixiang Trading Company's store personally led a mobile team, carrying more than 30 kinds of goods, to sell goods at the Zhuqiao bridge construction site. After learning that workers needed to make cotton clothes, they immediately consulted with the sewing industry. The trading company supplied cotton to solve the workers' cotton clothing problem.
    With the development of business, many fixed trade outlets have been established in various places in the past two months. The Kashgar Trade Branch of Xinjiang established a mining area trade branch. The Xi'an Trading Company established a fixed supply store at the construction site of the state-owned Xi'an No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory and moved its 13th store to the 362 construction site in the suburbs. According to the miners' requirements, the Yumen Mining Area Trading Company established the Baiyang River Trade Team on September 12. After more than a month of preparation, the Yan'an Trade Branch of Shaanxi established the Second Trade Store in the Yanchang Mining Area in mid-September. The Xianyang Trading Company established a trade store at the state-owned Xianyang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory in September. Workers were happy to see the trade store officially open and said, "It is extremely convenient to have a trade company here. We can buy what we need without going out, and we don't have to make unnecessary trips anymore."
    After the trade companies strengthened the supply of materials to mining areas and basic construction sites, the workers actively helped the trade companies solve various difficulties. For example, the workers in the Yanchang Mining Area vacated nine rooms for the Yanchang Second Trade Store to use. The trade union at the construction site of the state-owned Xi'an No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory in Xi'an helped the trade company prepare the counters, shelves, and other equipment for the business hall. Whenever a mobile team arrived at a construction site, the workers would pour hot water for the salespersons and pull their carts. Because the trade companies in various mining areas and construction sites supplied all kinds of goods, which reduced a lot of trouble for the workers, the workers were able to produce more effectively.

    西北贸易公司配合有计划的工业建设
    加强工矿区和基本建设工地的供应工作
    西北贸易公司所属单位为配合有计划的工业建设，便利工矿区、基本建设工地工人买货，对这些地区工人们所需要的物资大力供应，已满足了工人们的要求。例如玉门矿区距离城市较远，矿工们买东西很不方便。贸易公司根据矿工要求与本身可能，设立百货、文具、菜站、药铺及各种作坊，并经常派人驻西安、兰州、酒泉等地，进行采购工作。最近两月增加货物更多，共增加布匹、百货、副食品、中西药等品种四百八十种。一九五二年十月只经营八百八十种，现在已增加到二千五百多种。对过去所经营的若干商品价格不合理的现象，从八月起进行了调整。由于货源充实，价格趋向合理，第三季度销售计划超额完成百分之十点五五，较第二季度销售实绩增加百分之二十四。新疆独山子矿区贸易商店，学习其他地区的先进经验，采取双班制，每天营业时间从上午八时半至下午十时，使职工们下班后，仍能买到东西。今年上半年销售任务，提前完成，每人工作额超过新疆省公司所规定的工作量百分之一百零六点九二。
    各地贸易公司为坚持贯彻“面向厂矿、配合生产、保证供应”的方针，还抽出人员组织流动贸易组，携带货物，深入工矿区、基本建设工地，开展流动贸易，例如西安市贸易公司从今年四月份起，便组织了三个流动组，来回在郊区各基本建设工地卖货。陕西南郑阳平贸易商店组织流动组到天成路修建工地，供应工人们的物资。西乡贸易公司门市部主任，亲自领导流动组，携带三十多种货物，到茱桥修桥工地卖货，了解到工人需要做棉衣，立即与缝衣业商量，由贸易公司供应棉花，给工人们解决棉衣的问题。
    随着工作业务的发展，最近两个月内，各地先后成立了很多贸易固定据点，新疆喀什贸易分公司成立了矿区贸易支公司。西安市贸易公司在国营西安第五棉纺织厂工地设立固定供应店，并将所属第十三门市部迁至郊区三六二工地。玉门矿区贸易公司根据矿工们的要求，于九月十二日成立白杨河贸易组。陕西延安贸易分公司经过一个多月的筹备，于九月中旬，成立延长矿区第二贸易商店。咸阳市贸易公司于九月在国营咸阳第二棉纺织厂成立贸易商店。工人们看到贸易商店正式营业，高兴地说：“贸易公司在这里成立，真是便利极了，不出门就能买到自己所需要的东西，不再跑冤枉路了。”
    贸易公司加强了工矿地区、基本建设工地的物资供应工作以后，工人们积极帮助贸易公司解决各种困难。如延长矿区工人们腾出九间房子，给延长第二贸易商店使用。西安市国营西安第五棉纺织厂工地工会帮助贸易公司准备好营业室的柜台、货架等设备。凡是流动组一到工地，工人同志就给售货员端开水、拉车子。由于各个矿区工地有了贸易公司供应各种各样的货物，减少了工人的许多麻烦，就使工人能更好地进行生产。（方承杰）
