In the increase production and practice economy campaign, the state-owned commercial system is actively organizing and vigorously promoting the sales of industrial products in coordination with the central task of grain purchase, in order to ensure the completion of the state purchase and sales plan, especially to strive to over fulfill the sales plan. Some preliminary achievements have been made in some regions and some units. This is mainly reflected in the fact that the source of goods has increased significantly compared with the past, the variety of colors and varieties has increased, the inventory of goods is quite sufficient, and the vast majority of goods are sufficient to stabilize market prices and meet the needs of the people. In addition, the transfer work is more timely, and the backward phenomenon of "sweatshirts arriving in autumn and woolen yarn arriving in winter" in previous years has been basically reversed. Now, winter goods have been transported to various grassroots sales units, which has laid a material foundation for vigorously carrying out the promotion of grain purchase. In terms of promotion methods, the ideas of relying on cooperatives in various places are much clearer than in the past, so the mutual relations are also closer than in the past. Some state-owned commercial units have adopted methods such as holding symposiums for grass-roots cooperatives, symposiums for retailers and peddlers, and bringing goods samples to fairs for exhibitions, which have achieved certain good results in the promotion of goods. Therefore, reflected in the proportion of wholesale in the peak season market, the proportion of state-owned enterprises is showing an upward trend (the business volume of private enterprises has not decreased, and has also slightly increased).

However, judging from the development of industrial product promotion work in various provinces, cities, and state-owned companies across the country, the development is uneven. Some regions and some companies have not only completed the sales plan for the third quarter, but also completed the plan for October better; some companies, especially department stores and hardware companies, although they have a lot of inventory, have not only failed to complete the plan for the third quarter, but also have not completed the sales plan for October well enough. This shows that the promotion of industrial products has not been fully and universally launched in some company systems, and its performance has the following three different situations:
(1) Emphasizing procurement and neglecting promotion. Some lower-level units that mainly promote industrial products still arrange procurement greater than sales in the procurement, sales, and inventory plans for the fourth quarter of the promotion season, and the inventory of goods at the end of the fourth quarter continues to increase compared with the end of the third quarter;
(2) The slogan of vigorously promoting sales to complete the sales task remains on paper, and does not actively mobilize employees, closely rely on cooperatives, and use retailers and peddlers to "launch" business, still taking the method of "waiting for customers to come to the door";
(3) Although action has begun, the key to promotion work has not been grasped
(vigorously developing wholesale business), but a handicraft-style approach has been adopted. For example, some units use their main energy to develop retail (strengthening retail is correct, but more importantly, strengthening wholesale business) or adopt the method of everyone in the entire store promoting sales, and managers also carry several kinds of daily necessities to institutions to contact promotion. Some units have also assigned sales tasks to the finance and accounting department. Because they are not familiar with the goods and do not understand the needs of buyers, some people have left their jobs and specialized in promotion, resulting in very little effect.

In order to further comprehensively carry out the promotion of industrial products, support the grain purchase task, and complete the state plan, a series of problems must be solved in terms of ideology, policy, and organization:
1. The growth and development of the idea of famous brands and the idea of hoarding goods is the main obstacle to the current promotion of industrial products. Many grass-roots stores want goods facing Shanghai, and toothpaste only wants the four famous brands (Black & White, Jianerchi, Guchi Ling, Luliangxiang), and gold pens also only want four famous brands. At the supply meeting of various supplier stores held by the Wuhu Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station in early October, each store only wanted Da Wuwei when distributing hand batteries. After Da Wuwei was distributed, each store did not complete the hand battery procurement plan; and the supply station had 37,900 dozen hand batteries of other brands, which each store did not want. The variety of goods operated by county stores in rural areas is not suitable for the needs of farmers, and the goods and high-end goods that sell well in cities are moved to the rural market. A county department store operated children's clothing and only sold one piece in a quarter. Another county store sold 16,800 yuan a can of Merlin beef (equivalent to four pounds of beef in the local area) and 8,900 yuan a can of Merlin green beans
(equivalent to more than eight pounds of green beans in the local area). Because they could not be sold for a long time, some of the meat had rotted and some of the cans were rusted. There are also county stores that stock spring pillows, dolls, and 200,000 yuan a pound of fine wool, which no one cares about at all. As for watches, gold pens, and high-end daily necessities, although sales in rural areas and county towns are very small, each grass-roots store is vying to get them, and after they are taken, they cannot be sold and are stockpiled. For example, a county store stocks 249 dozen of various gold pens, and only sells two or three a month, enough to sell for several years, while towels, socks, and locally woven striped cloth for cotton clothes linings, and supplies for primary and secondary schools that are suitable for the needs of the majority of farmers, are either not operated or have very few varieties. This famous brand idea is essentially a manifestation of the lack of clarity in the state-owned commercial view of serving whom. It limits the sales object (that is, the service object) to urban people (that is, cadres, workers, and citizens) and ignores the needs of the vast number of farmers, that is, it does not put its main energy on serving the majority of people. Therefore, this famous brand idea can also be said to be an urban viewpoint. Many responsible cadres of county stores have this idea very seriously. When asking for goods from higher-level companies, they always focus on several famous brands, thinking that if these goods are not supplied, how can the sales task be completed? Although there are many similar and high-quality goods, they do not actively promote them. The root cause of this idea is mainly that the state-owned commercial system does not understand the needs of residents (especially the needs of farmers), and subjectively believes that famous brands can always be sold, which promotes the official-style management style of "waiting for customers to come to the door", which is essentially a lazy idea of seeking leisure and fearing trouble at work; another reason is that the customer feedback and customer opinions heard and seen by the state-owned commercial sector are mostly the feedback and opinions of cadres and citizens, such as the lack of accordions, the lack of children's diapers, the lack of compasses and triangles, etc., while the opinions of farmers are difficult to reflect.

As for the idea of hoarding goods, it is mainly manifested in the concern about out-of-stock and the fear of private merchants buying up goods, and the fear of not being able to stabilize prices, so they dare not actively organize sales. For example, a store in a medium-sized city stocks more than 10,000 pounds of wool and more than 1,000 dozen Taiping boots. The store's salesperson believes that if they are only asked to retail themselves and cooperatives, the wool will not be sold out after winter and will be stockpiled. However, the higher-level only asked the store to retail and supply cooperatives for retail, and did not allow wholesale. Many factories and institutions requested to sign supply contracts and supply goods according to the plan. Some stores were also worried about insufficient supply and were afraid of not being able to guarantee the needs, so they did not dare to sign contracts. The root cause of this hoarding idea of fearing out-of-stock is, first of all, that the Central Ministry of Commerce and various general companies do not understand the production, sales, and balance of certain commodities enough, so they cannot clearly explain to the lower levels, so that the lower levels have a clear understanding; secondly, the lower-level companies and stores do not understand the market demand of residents and the supply and inventory of certain commodities enough. Therefore, when they see that what goods are selling more and faster in a certain period, they think that out-of-stock will occur, and they take measures to control sales, which often causes some commodities (especially seasonal commodities) to be stockpiled. The solution to this problem, in addition to fundamentally strengthening the investigation and research work at all levels, the leading organs clarifying the production, sales, and balance situation, and the lower-level units clarifying the market residents' needs and the supply and inventory situation, we should also analyze clearly the nature of several different types of out-of-stock, and should not shout empty slogans against out-of-stock, so that the lower levels do not know what to do, resulting in stockpiling. There are the following types of out-of-stock: (1) Due to the one-sided accounting viewpoint, fearing stockpiling and not actively organizing procurement, resulting in a reduction in varieties and out-of-stock, as was the case in the first half of this year, which should be opposed; (2) Not understanding the needs of the people, random allocation of goods, complicated scheduling procedures, too slow circulation of goods, too many circulation links, no contact between upper and lower levels and inside and outside, departmentalism, the same goods are stockpiled here and out of stock there, and there are goods in the warehouse or even stockpiled, but the store is out of stock, which should be improved; (3) Mastering the source of goods and having goods but refusing to sell, being conservative and hoarding goods, storing goods in the warehouse without organizing sales, resulting in market out-of-stock, and consumers cannot buy the goods they need; on the other hand, some stores, due to the famous brand idea, do not organize procurement according to the needs of local buyers, resulting in goods that do not meet the needs, which not only causes stockpiling, but also fails to meet the needs of buyers, all of which should be blamed, and therefore should be overcome.
(4) Appropriately allocating goods to suitable sales locations, actively organizing sales, supplying consumers (this includes their own retail, cooperative retail, and organizing and supervising retailers and peddlers to sell them), recovering currency, and supporting grain purchase, resulting in a temporary out-of-stock situation for a few varieties, which should not be criticized, but should be considered a reasonable phenomenon.

2. In terms of industrial product promotion policies, we should conscientiously implement the principle of wholesale as the main focus, and take the method of "launching" business to complete the sales task. Emphasizing retail and taking the method of "waiting for customers to come to the door" will definitely not complete the task. In order to develop wholesale business and launch business, first of all, we must actively and closely combine with cooperatives, and we must recognize the main significance of relying on cooperatives to connect with millions of people in terms of ideology and policy, rather than just in words. At present, there are many shortcomings in contacting cooperatives, which are related to the lack of ideological recognition of the importance of relying on cooperatives. To maintain close contact with cooperatives, salespeople should be sent to grass-roots cooperatives to understand the needs of farmers and the sales and inventory of cooperatives. The price preference rate for cooperatives must be resolutely implemented. Fast-selling, smooth-selling, and famous brand goods needed by farmers must first meet the needs of cooperatives, and sales on credit within ten days should be earnestly implemented for grass-roots cooperatives with relatively difficult funds. Provide assistance and support to cooperatives in terms of business operation, technology, and variety, so that cooperatives can sell quickly and collect frequently, expand sales varieties, and achieve the goal that both cooperatives and state-owned commerce can expand commodity circulation and accelerate capital turnover.

Secondly, we must implement the comprehensive policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private commerce. The current situation is that: in some areas, the restriction of unfavorable aspects of private merchants is more, the lack of contact is more, and the organization and utilization of their favorable aspects is less. In last year's peak season industrial product promotion campaign, state-owned commerce in various places united and utilized many small urban and rural wholesalers and retail peddlers, and supplied them to the vast number of consumers. Since this year, due to the activity of large wholesalers and the reduction of varieties in state-owned commerce in the first half of the year, most of these small wholesalers and retail peddlers have broken away from contact with state-owned commerce and contacted large wholesalers. We must understand that at present, small wholesalers engaged in transportation between urban and rural areas and retail peddlers in cities and towns still play an important role in promoting goods. Especially under the current situation that cooperatives and state-owned commercial retail networks are not widespread and the proportion of private retail is still large, they should be correctly utilized. At present, state-owned commerce has mastered a large number of goods. If they are only distributed through state-owned retail and cooperatives without utilizing small wholesalers and retailers, many goods will not be able to meet consumers quickly, and the purpose of expanding promotion will not be achieved, which will hinder the accelerated circulation of goods and fail to meet the needs of the market and buyers. As a result, the goods of state-owned commerce will inevitably be stockpiled, hindering state-owned commerce from implementing the fundamental policy of serving production and consumers better. Therefore, in addition to strictly managing and restricting private merchants who speculate, buy up, hoard, and resell, state-owned commerce should also utilize small wholesalers between urban and rural areas while satisfying cooperatives and state-owned retail under the premise that they abide by government laws and obey the leadership and supervision of state-owned commerce in terms of planning and price. Private retailers should be supplied even more to facilitate the expansion of commodity supply and accelerate capital turnover. Thirdly, the needs of large user departments such as institutions, organizations, troops, factories, and schools should be actively supplied. However, some grass-roots units of state-owned commerce often dare not sign supply contracts with these large user departments because they are not clear about the situation, resulting in these large user departments either buying from the place of origin or being forced to buy from private merchants. This makes it impossible to include the units that are easiest to plan supply into the state plan, which is an issue that state-owned commerce should solve from the perspective of planning and supply.

3. In terms of organizational work, we must pay close attention to further strengthening and improving the allocation and transportation of goods. At present, the turnover of goods in many state-owned commercial departments is still very slow. The time for goods to enter and leave the warehouse generally takes seven or eight days. A large part of the goods often stays in the warehouse and on the way of transportation for a long time and cannot meet consumers. At the same time, the phenomenon of stockpiling here and out-of-stock there still occurs from time to time due to inaccurate planning and improper allocation. All levels of leadership must pay close attention to these problems and mobilize all employees to establish a communication system for exchanging information and timely allocating and adjusting them to solve and improve them.

At present, there are only two months left in the peak commercial season. The leading organs and enterprises of state-owned commerce at all levels must take urgent action. In order to cooperate with the purchase of grain and to support the production of industrial products in the off-season of next spring, it is required to rapidly and vigorously carry out the promotion of industrial products in these precious two or three months. Under the leadership of the local party committees, we should strive to over-fulfill the promotion plan and gloriously realize the tasks of state-owned commerce in cooperating with the purchase of grain, cotton, oilseeds, and other major crops, as well as the task of increasing production and practicing economy.

    克服名牌惜售思想大力开展工业品的推销工作
    中央商业部工作检查组组长　张翼飞
    在增产节约运动中，国营商业系统配合购粮的中心任务，正积极组织大力推销工业品，为保证完成国家购销计划特别是争取超额完成销售计划而前进着。在某些地区某些单位且已取得了一些初步成绩。这主要表现在商品货源已较过去有显著增加，花色品种增多，库存商品相当充实，绝大多数商品足以稳定市场物价和满足人民的需要。加以调运工作较及时，基本上扭转了往年“秋来汗衫到、冬去毛线来”的落后现象。现在，冬季货都已运送到各个基层销货单位，这就给大力开展推销配合购粮工作打下了物资基础。在推销方法上，各地依靠合作社的思想较过去明确得多了，因此相互关系也较已往密切，有些国营商业单位采取了基层社座谈会，零售商小贩座谈会及带货样到集镇展览等办法，使商品推销工作收到了一定的良好效果。所以，表现在旺季市场批发比重上，国营比重呈现上升局面（私营营业额并未下降，且亦稍有上升）。
    但从全国各省、市以及各国营公司在推销工业品工作的发展上来看是不平衡的，有些地区和有些公司不但完成了三季度的销货计划，而且十月份的计划也完成得较好；有些公司特别是百货公司、五金公司虽然库存很多，不但未完成三季度计划，且十月份销货计划完成得也不够好。这说明工业品推销工作在有些公司系统尚未全面普遍的展开，其表现有以下三种不同情况：
      （一）重视进货忽视推销，有些以工业品推销为主的下层单位在推销旺季的第四季度的进、销、库计划安排上，仍是进货大于销货，四季度末的商品库存比三季末继续增加；
      （二）大力推销完成销货任务的口号停留在口头上，而不去积极的发动职工，密切依靠合作社、利用零售商和小贩将业务“打出去”，仍采取“等客上门”的办法；
      （三）虽已开始行动但未抓住推销工作的关键
  （大力开展批发业务），而采取了手工业式的办法，如有些单位用主要精力开展零售（加强零售是对的、但更重要的是加强批发业务）或采取全商店人员人人推销的办法，经理也背上几种日用品到机关去联系推销，有的单位财会股也分配了销货任务，因对商品不熟悉对购买者需要不了解，有些人虽脱离本职工作，专门去推销，结果效果很小。
    为了进一步全面开展工业品的推销工作、配合支持购粮任务，完成国家计划，必须从思想上政策上组织工作上解决一系列的问题：
    一、名牌货思想、惜售思想的滋长和发展，这是目前开展工业品推销的主要障碍。许多基层商店要货时面向大上海，牙膏只要四大名牌（黑白、坚尔齿、固齿灵、留兰香），金笔也只要四种名牌货。芜湖百货采购供应站在十月初召开的各被供应商店的供应会议上，各商店分配手电池时都只要大无畏一种，把大无畏分光后，各商店都未完成手电池的进货计划；而供应站存有其他牌号的手电池三万七千九百打，各商店都不要。处于农村中的县商店经营的商品品种不少不适合农民的需要，把在城市适销的商品及高档货搬到农村市场。有一个县百货商店经营童装，一个季度只卖出一件。另一个县商店卖一万六千八百元一筒的梅林牛肉罐头（在当地合四斤牛肉价格）和八千九百元一筒的梅林青豆罐头
  （在当地合八斤多青豆价格）因长期卖不掉，有的肉已腐烂，有的筒子生了锈。还有的县商店存有弹簧枕、洋娃娃以及二十多万元一磅的细毛线，根本无人问津。至于手表、金笔及高档日用品在农村及县城虽然销路很小，但是各基层商店却争着要，要去后销不出去又积压起来。如有一县商店存有各种金笔二百四十九打，每月只销两三支，足够销售好几年，而适合广大农民需要的四、五千元以下的毛巾、袜子及作棉衣里子用的土织条格布，中小学校用品等不是不经营就是品种很少。这种名牌货思想实质上是国营商业为什么人服务的观点不够明确的表现。它把销售对象（亦即服务对象）局限于城市人民（即干部、工人、市民）而忽视了广大的农民群众的需要，就是没有把主要精力用在为多数人服务上，因此这种名牌思想也可以说是城市观点。不少的县商店负责干部，这种思想十分严重。在向上级公司要货时，总是钻在几种名牌货上，认为如这些商品供应不上销货任务怎能完成？虽然有很多同类同质的商品也不去积极推销。这种思想产生的根源，主要是国营商业系统对居民需要（特别是农民的需要）不了解，主观上认为有了名牌货总可以卖掉，这就助长了“等客上门”的官字号的经营作风，实质上是一种图轻闲怕麻烦的懒汉思想在作怪；另一个原因是国营商业方面听到的顾客反映，看到的顾客意见，绝大部分是干部市民的反映和意见，如缺乏手风琴啦，没有小孩尿布啦，没有圆规、三角版啦等，而农民的意见则很难反映到面前来。
    至于惜售思想则主要表现为顾虑脱销及怕私商套购，怕稳定不了物价，而不敢积极的组织出售。如有一个中等城市的商店存毛线一万多磅，太平靴
  一千多打，该店营业员认为如果只叫自己和合作社零售，毛线到过了冬季也卖不完，会积压起来。但上级由于却只叫门市零售及供给合作社零售，不准批发。许多工厂机关要求签订供应合同，按计划供应货物，有些商店也顾虑货源不足，怕保证不了需要而不敢签订合同。这种怕脱销的惜售思想产生的根源，首先是由于中央商业部和各总公司对某些商品的产销及平衡情况了解不够，因而也就无法给下级交代清楚，使下级心中有数；其次是下级公司、商店对某些商品的市场居民需要情况和货源库存情况也不够了解。于是看到什么货在某一时期销的多了快了，即认为将要发生脱销，即采取掌握出售办法，结果又往往使某些商品（特别是季节性商品）造成积压。解决这一问题的办法除从根本上加强各级的调查研究工作，领导机关研究清楚产销及平衡情况，下级单位研究清楚市场居民需要情况及货源与库存情况外，还应分析清楚几种不同脱销的性质，不应空喊反对脱销使下级无所适从，结果又形成积压。脱销有如下几种：（一）由于片面核算观点，怕积压而不积极组织进货，造成品种减少与脱销，如今年前半年那样，这是应该反对的；（二）不了解人民需要，商品乱调拨，调度手续繁杂，商品流转太慢，流转环节过多，上下之间内外之间互不联系，本位主义，同样商品此处积压彼处脱销及仓库有货甚或积压而门市脱销，这是应该改进的；（三）掌握了货源有货不肯卖，保守惜售，把商品存在仓库里没有组织销售，因而发生市场脱销，消费者买不到需要的商品；另一方面有些商店由于名牌思想作怪不是根据当地购买者的需要来组织进货，结果货不对路，既造成积压，又不能满足购买者需要，这些都是应该受到责备的，因而也是应该克服的。
  （四）把商品恰当地调配到合销地点，积极的组织了销售，供应了消费者（这包括自己零售合作社零售及组织与监督零售商小贩销售出去等方面）回笼了货币，支持了购粮，而产生了少数品种临时脱销情况，这不应该受到批评而应该认为是合理的现象。
    二、在工业品推销政策上，应认真贯彻批发为主的方针，采取把业务“打出去”的办法，才能完成销货任务。着重零售和采取“等客上门”的办法肯定是完不成任务的。为了开展批发业务和把业务打出去，首先必须主动密切结合合作社，必须从思想上、政策上而不是在口头上认识依靠合作社通过合作社联系千百万人民的主要意义。目前在与合作社联系上存在着许多缺点是与思想上不认识依靠合作社的重要性相关联的。要与合作社保持密切联系，应经常派营业员到基层社了解农民需要与合作社的销货情况库存情况，要坚决贯彻对合作社的价格优待率，农民需要的畅销货顺销货名牌货要首先满足合作社的需要，并认真执行对资金比较困难的基层社给予十日以内的赊销。在业务经营和技术上品种上给合作社以帮助和支持，以便合作社快卖勤收，扩大销售品种，达到合作社与国营商业都能够扩大商品流通与加速资金流转。
    其次要贯彻对私营商业的利用限制改造的全面政策。目前的情况是：若干地区对私商限制其不利的方面多、不来往多，而组织利用其有利的方面少。在去年旺季工业品推销运动中，各地国营商业都团结利用着不少的城乡贩运的小批发商和零售商小贩，并通过他们供给广大消费者。今年以来由于大批发商的活跃及国营商业前半年品种减少，这些小批发商和零售小贩多半脱离了与国营商业的联系，而与大批发商联系了起来。我们必须了解目前从事城乡之间贩运的小批发商和城市与乡镇的零售小贩在推销商品上还是有重要作用的。特别是目前合作社与国营商业零售网不普遍，私营零售比重尚大的情况下，更应正确地加以利用。目前国营商业已掌握了大批商品，如果只经过国营零售与合作社分配而不利用小批发商与零售商，就会使不少商品不能迅速地与购买者见面，也就不能达到扩大推销的目的，从而就会妨碍商品的加速流转，不能满足市场与购买者的需要。其结果，必然使国营商业的货物积压起来，妨碍国营商业贯彻为生产为消费者更好服务的根本方针。因此除对投机套购囤积倒把的私商进行严格的管理限制外，对城乡之间的小批发商、零售商小贩在其遵守政府法令与服从国营商业在计划上价格上的领导与监督之下，国营商业在满足了合作社与国营零售的同时，对城乡之间的小批发商亦应加以利用，对私营零售商，更应予以供应。以利扩大商品供应，加速资金周转。再次对机关、团体、部队、工厂、学校等大用货部门的需要应主动的加以供应。而有些国营商业基层单位由于心中无数，往往不敢与这些大用货部门签订供货合同，结果使这些大用货部门不是到产地购买，便是被迫到私商处去购买。这就使最容易计划供应的单位不能纳入国家计划中去，这是国营商业极应从计划工作上和供应工作上加以解决的课题。
    三、在组织工作上，必须十分注意进一步加强与改进商品的调拨运送工作。目前有不少国营商业部门的商品运转还很迟慢，商品入库出库时间一般需要七、八天，很大一部分商品经常滞留在仓库与运输途中，长时间不能与消费者见面，同时还由于计划不准确，分配不当，此处积压彼处脱销的现象还不时发生，这些问题都必须各级领导引起密切注意并发动全体职工，建立互通情报的联系制及时调运与调剂，加以解决和改进。
    目前商业旺季只有两个月的时间，各级国营商业的领导机关和企业单位，必须紧急行动起来，为了配合粮食的收购工作，为了支持明春淡季工业品的生产，都要求在此两三个月的宝贵时间内把工业品推销工作迅速大力的开展起来，在各地党委的领导下争取超额完成推销计划，光荣地实现国营商业配合收购粮食棉花油料及其他主要作物的任务与增产节约任务。
