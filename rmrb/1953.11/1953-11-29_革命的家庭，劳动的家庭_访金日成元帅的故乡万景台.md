    Revolutionary Family, Laboring Family
    —A Visit to Marshal Kim Il-sung's Hometown, Mangyongdae—
    Jin Feng
    About thirty li southwest from Pyongyang, alongside the beautiful Taedong River, there is a hill covered with green pines and chestnut trees, which is the famous Mangyongdae. Right next to the hill stands a simple gray Korean-style house, which is where the beloved leader of the Korean people, Marshal Kim Il-sung, was born and spent his childhood.
    The early winter sun shines brightly on the harvested fields, and on the golden gourds and pumpkins hanging under the eaves. A stone mill lies there peacefully, and the threshing machine exudes the fragrance of newly harvested rice. A flock of chickens and ducks run around in the yard, and a wolfhound barks at us. A middle-aged woman in a white coarse cloth dress opens the door and greets us with a smile. She is Hyun Yang-shin, Marshal Kim Il-sung's aunt.
    According to Korean custom, we took off our shoes and stepped onto the heated floor. This is a combined two-room space, with a large photograph of Marshal Kim Il-sung hanging on the right-hand wall. Opposite it is a Chinese New Year picture, "Mutual Aid and Cooperative Farming Yield More Grain, Military Families Live Well." On the front wall is a poster of two boys and girls holding doves of peace, "We Love Peace." Coming from China, we naturally feel especially close when we see these Chinese pictures in Marshal Kim Il-sung's home. An old woman is sitting on the heated floor, the hard years have etched wrinkles on her face, and her lips are constantly trembling. This is Marshal Kim Il-sung's seventy-eight-year-old grandmother. The old man smoking a pipe in the outer room is Kim Bo-hyun, Marshal Kim Il-sung's eighty-three-year-old grandfather. In addition, the family includes Kim Hyung-rok, Marshal Kim Il-sung's uncle, and his wife Hyun Yang-shin, as well as their daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Uncle Kim Hyung-rok has gone to the vegetable garden and has not yet returned. After greeting the elders, we asked Aunt Hyun Yang-shin to tell us about the story of Marshal Kim Il-sung's family.
    Before the liberation in 1945, life in Marshal Kim Il-sung's family was very difficult. All they cultivated was dry land, not a single paddy field. Almost the entire family labored, and even then, they sometimes couldn't get enough to eat or wear. When Hyun Yang-shin married into the Kim family thirty-eight years ago, Kim Il-sung was only three years old. Kim Il-sung's father, Kim Hyung-jik, was teaching at the village school. He was a very serious man, deeply felt the pain of national subjugation, and didn't like to talk much when he came home. As soon as he returned, he would hold three-year-old Kim Il-sung and always sing him the song he composed himself: "Grow up quickly, grow up to be a hero, a useful talent." When Kim Il-sung grew a little older, he often told stories to the child, mostly about how painful it was to lose the country and how revolutionary heroes saved the country. In this way, the seeds of patriotism were deeply planted in the young Kim Il-sung's heart.
    At this time, Kim Il-sung's father had already participated in revolutionary activities and was arrested twice. When Kim Il-sung was seven years old, his father had to take the whole family across the Yalu River to settle in Northeast China to escape the persecution of special agents and military police, while continuing his revolutionary work. When Kim Il-sung was thirteen years old, his father sent him back to his hometown to study. When Kim Il-sung was fourteen years old, his father fell ill from overwork. Kim Il-sung rushed to Northeast China to see him. On his deathbed, his father said to his third brother, Hyung-kwon, and his two children, Sung-joo (that is, Kim Il-sung) and Chul-joo: "I have finally failed to see the liberation of the motherland and died of illness. When you grow up, you must dedicate yourselves to the cause of the motherland's liberation." They did not fail their brother and father's expectations. Hyung-kwon and Chul-joo both participated in revolutionary activities and were arrested and sacrificed one after another. Just as this revolutionary family successively sacrificed three sons for the cause of the motherland's liberation, the guerrillas led by Marshal Kim Il-sung grew stronger in the vast snow of the Changbai Mountains. So the special agents and military police constantly searched for Marshal Kim Il-sung's family, twice taking away Marshal Kim Il-sung's grandmother to threaten and lure her, and attempting to frame her. However, the unyielding old woman did not succumb to the special agents. At this time, Won-joo, the second son of Kim Hyung-rok, Marshal Kim Il-sung's uncle, also joined the revolution and organized the Fatherland Liberation Group.
    Finally, the days of hardship came to an end. In 1945, the Soviet Red Army liberated North Korea, and Marshal Kim Il-sung returned. At this time, the house was still the four broken thatched cottages where he was born. His uncle and aunt felt bad that he had to live in such a dilapidated house. He smiled and said, "A poor child returning to his own home doesn't need to worry about living in a good house." He stayed warmly for one night and left.
    Immediately afterward, North Korea implemented land reform, and Marshal Kim Il-sung's family also received four thousand pyong of paddy fields and one thousand pyong of dry fields (Note: Three hundred pyong is approximately equal to one mu in China). The grandfather excitedly said, "Our family has been farming for three generations, and this is the first time we have cultivated paddy fields." The family's life gradually improved, and the family members worked even harder. Although the grandfather was very old, he still worked tirelessly. On the day of our visit, we saw him either sweeping the yard, drying firewood, or tidying up farm tools, never resting for a moment. Aunt Hyun Yang-shin told us that Marshal Kim Il-sung sometimes drove his grandfather to visit, but the old man would return after only a few days. When asked why he didn't stay longer, he always said, "We are farmers, accustomed to working, and there is nothing to do. I can't just sit around doing nothing, so I came back." What simple and hardworking working people!
    Before the outbreak of the American invasion of Korea, Marshal Kim Il-sung often took time to come home. He liked to talk to the farmers in the village, asking about their harvests and living conditions. After the armistice, he specially returned home to see his grandfather and grandmother, to see his parents' graves and the crops in the fields. Not long ago, his uncle and aunt went to see him together. It was the beginning of the harvest season. Marshal Kim Il-sung was very concerned about this year's harvest and the matter of delivering public grain. The first thing he asked his uncle was, "How is the harvest this year? Is the public grain ready?" His uncle told him, "This year's harvest is not bad. We harvested more than 130 straw bags of grain (50 kilograms per bag). We harvested 12,000 catties of cabbage and radishes. The public grain has already been prepared. Don't worry, my family will not lag behind in delivering public grain."
    Listening to Aunt Hyun Yang-shin's narration of the thirty-year history of the family of the Korean people's leader, we saw the face of the unyielding Korean people. The history of the family of the Korean people's leader reflects the history of heroic Korea. Saying goodbye to Aunt's home, we saw more than a dozen white doves peacefully pecking at food on the roof, and the wolfhound lazily lying under the eaves sunning itself. A clump of rose of Sharon (Korea's national flower) in the courtyard, although the branches and leaves have fallen, stands tall and independent in the cold wind, symbolizing this unyielding heroic family. A few steps out of Marshal Kim Il-sung's house, we stepped onto the famous Mangyongdae Hill. The hillside is covered with pine trees, and the surrounding area is an orchard. It must be a place of flowers in full bloom in the spring. Currently, only the green pines remain. Following the hillside, there is a flat plain. One side of the hill is steep, with the green Taedong River flowing below. From this plain, the west is a picturesque distant mountain, and the silver Taedong River flows calmly in the sunlight, sparkling with ripples. To the south is the urban area of Pyongyang with tall power poles, to the north below the mountain is Marshal Kim Il-sung's former residence, and to the east are two tall buildings—the Advanced Military Academy and the Martyrs' Children's School, both founded under the initiative of Marshal Kim Il-sung.
    When climbing Mangyongdae, one cannot help but think that Marshal Kim Il-sung must have often come here in his childhood to view the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland. The beautiful rivers and mountains influenced him, the revolutionary family educated him, and the arduous struggle tempered him. This is how the leader grew up, and in this place, the Advanced Military Academy and the Martyrs' Children's School, initiated by Marshal Kim Il-sung, are nurturing thousands upon thousands of future heroes.

    革命的家庭，劳动的家庭
    ——访金日成元帅的故乡万景台——
    金凤
    从平壤向西南走上三十来里，傍着美丽的大同江有一座长满青松和栗子树的山岗，就是著名的万景台了。紧挨着山岗下有一所灰色的朴素的朝鲜式房屋，这就是朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅出生和度过童年的地方。
    初冬的阳光灿烂地照耀着收割后的田野，照耀着屋檐下挂着的黄澄澄的葫芦和南瓜。一座石磨平静地躺在那里，打谷机上散发着新割稻禾的香味。成群的鸡鸭在院中跑来跑去，一条狼狗朝着我们叫起来。一位穿着白色粗布衣裙的中年妇女推开门微笑着招呼我们，她就是金日成元帅的婶母玄阳信。
    我们按着朝鲜的风俗，脱了鞋子踏上炕席。这里是一并两间打通的屋子，右面墙上挂着金日成元帅的大照片，对面是一张中国的年画“互助代耕多打粮，军属生活过得强”，正面墙上是两个男女孩子捧着和平鸽的“我们热爱和平”的招贴画。来自中国的我们在金日成元帅家中看到这些中国画片，自然觉得分外亲切。炕席上坐着一位老太太，辛劳的岁月已经在她脸上刻满了皱纹，她的嘴唇也不时抖动着，这就是金日成元帅七十八岁的老祖母。在外面一间房子里正在抽着旱烟的老先生，就是金日成元帅八十三岁的老祖父金铺铉。此外，这个家庭还有金日成元帅的叔父金亨禄和婶母玄阳信以及他们的儿媳、孙子们。金亨禄叔父上菜园地去了还没有回来，我们向老人问过好以后就请玄阳信婶母给我们讲述金日成元帅的家庭的故事。
    一九四五年解放以前，金日成元帅家里的生活很苦，全部种的是旱地，没有一块水田，几乎全家劳动，有时还不能穿得暖吃得饱。当三十八年前，玄阳信嫁到金家时，金日成才三岁，金日成的父亲金亨稷正在村里的学校教书。他是个很严肃的人，深深感到亡国的痛苦，回家也不爱多说话。一回来就抱着三岁的金日成，老是给还不懂事的孩子唱他自己编的那个歌：“快快长大起来，长大了成一个英雄、成一个有用的人才。”等到金日成稍稍长大一点，他就常常讲故事给孩子听，讲的多是亡国多么痛苦以及革命英雄如何救国的故事。这样在幼年金日成的心田中，已经深深种下了爱国思想的种子。
    这时，金日成的父亲已经参加了革命活动，先后两次被捕。当金日成七岁时，他父亲为了躲避特务宪兵的迫害就不得不带着全家逃过鸭绿江，来到中国的东北安家，同时继续他的革命工作。金日成十三岁的时候，他父亲送他回到故乡来读书。金日成十四岁时，他父亲积劳成病了，金日成匆匆赶到东北去看望，他父亲临死时对自己的三弟亨权和两个孩子成柱（就是金日成）和铁柱说：“我终于没有见到祖国的解放，因病死去，你们长大了一定献身祖国解放事业。”他们没有辜负自己的兄长和父亲的期望，亨权和铁柱先后都参加了革命活动，同时先后被捕牺牲了。就在这个革命的家庭先后为祖国解放事业献出三个子弟的当儿，在长白山一带茫茫风雪中，金日成元帅率领的游击队壮大起来了。于是特务和宪兵就不断地搜索着金日成元帅的家庭，曾经两次把金日成元帅的老祖母带走，进行威胁和利诱，并企图加以陷害，但是，不屈的老人，并没有在特务面前屈服。就在这时，金日成元帅叔父金亨禄的二儿子元柱也参加了革命，组织了祖国解放团。
    终于，苦难的日子熬到了头。一九四五年，苏联红军解放了北朝鲜，金日成元帅回来了。这时，家中还是他出生时候的四间破草房。叔父和婶母觉得让他住这样的破房子很过意不去，他笑着说：“穷孩子回自己的家，还讲究住什么好房子。”亲亲热热住了一夜走了。
    紧接着，北朝鲜实行了土地改革，金日成元帅家中也分到了四千坪水田和一千坪旱田（注：三百坪约合中国一亩）。老祖父兴奋地说：“我家种了三辈子田，才第一次种到水田。”家里的生活也渐渐好起来了，家里的人劳动得也更勤了，老祖父虽然年纪很老了，还是不停地劳动着，就在我们访问的那一天，还看到他不是扫院子，就是晒柴火，再不就是收拾农具，一刻都不休息。玄阳信婶母告诉我们，金日成元帅有时用车子把祖父接去，但他老人家住不上几天就回来了。有人问他为什么不多住几天，他总是说：“咱是农民，劳动惯了，又没有什么事，白白待不下去，所以回来了。”多么淳朴勤劳的劳动人民啊！
    美国侵略朝鲜的战争爆发以前，金日成元帅也常抽空回家来，他最喜欢和村里的农民谈话，问他们的收成情况，生活情况。停战以后，他又特地回家来看祖父和祖母，来看父母的坟墓和田里的庄稼。不久以前叔父和婶母一起去看他，那时正开始收割，金日成元帅非常关心今年的年成和交公粮的事情，见了叔父第一句话就问：“今年收成怎么样？公粮准备好没有？”叔父告诉他：“今年收成不坏，粮食收了一百三十多草袋（一草袋五十公斤）。白菜、萝卜收了一万二千斤，公粮早已准备好了，你放心，我家交公粮不会落后的。”
    听着玄阳信婶母关于朝鲜人民领袖的家庭三十多年历史的叙述，我们看到了不屈的朝鲜人民的面貌。朝鲜人民领袖的家庭的历史正反映了英雄朝鲜的历史。从婶母屋中告辞出来，只见屋顶上十几只白鸽在安详地啄食着食物，狼狗懒洋洋地躺在屋檐下晒太阳。院子中一丛无穷花（朝鲜的国花）虽然枝叶脱落，却在寒风中挺然独立，它正象征着这不屈的英雄家庭。出了金日成元帅家门几步就跨上著名的万景台山岗。岗坡上下都是松树，岗坡周围是一片果树林，春天时候该是花开似锦吧，目前只有苍松依然翠绿。顺着岗坡上去是一片平阳地，山岗的一面陡立，下面流着碧绿的大同江。从这块平阳地望出去，西面是如画的远山，阳光下银色大同江平静地流着，闪耀着微波。南面是树立着高高电线杆的平壤市区，北面山下就是金日成元帅的故居，东面是两幢高大的建筑——高级军官学院和烈士子弟学校，都是在金日成元帅倡议下创办起来的。
    在登临万景台的时候，不禁会想到金日成元帅小时候该是时常到这里来观看祖国大好江山的吧。锦绣的河山影响了他，革命的家庭教育了他，艰苦的斗争锻炼了他。领袖就是这样成长起来了，而且就在这个地方，金日成元帅倡议创办的高级军官学院和烈士子弟学校正培育着千千万万未来的英雄。
