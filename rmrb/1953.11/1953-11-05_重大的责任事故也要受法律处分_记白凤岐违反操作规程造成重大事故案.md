　Major Responsibility Accidents Must Also Be Subject to Legal Punishment
　　-- On the Case of Bai Fengqi Violating Operating Procedures and Causing a Major Accident
　　Yuan Xing

    Our country's laws are not to be violated. Our country's laws, in order to consolidate the people's democratic government and safeguard the country's economic construction, do not allow counter-revolutionaries to carry out any conspiracies, nor do they allow any serious violations of labor discipline, embezzlement, theft, or events damaging state property. The Tianjin Railway Line Special Court convened a sentencing rally on October 17th, announcing the judgments in the case of Bai Fengqi and others who, due to dereliction of duty and violation of operating procedures, caused a major accident at Neiqiu Station, and the case of Yan Jingshan and others who continued to embezzle after the "Three-Anti" movement, which is a vivid illustration of this.

    Bai Fengqi was a track maintenance foreman of the Third Line Bridge Engineering Team of Neiqiu Station, under the Tianjin Railway Administration. On June 29th of this year, when Bai Fengqi was working on extending the track at the lead curve of the No. 2 turnout at the station, he failed to contact the relevant local authorities. He seriously violated the Provisional Railway Maintenance Rules and technical management regulations, blindly started work, and arbitrarily removed all the ballast between the sleepers of the turnout, and dismantled four "Overlord Iron" (霸王铁) pieces controlling the track gauge. He left it unattended for three days in the sweltering heat without setting up any protection, causing the track to lose its longitudinal and lateral level and bearing capacity. This resulted in a major train derailment and overturning accident on July 2nd, causing the state to suffer a loss of 580 million yuan, delaying sixteen trains for a total of 131 hours, and seriously hindering railway transportation. Before the accident, Wang Yumin, the track maintenance section chief of Neiqiu Station, had twice suggested to Bai Fengqi that he "should not remove the Overlord Iron". Bai not only did not accept the suggestion but said, "Don't worry, we'll be responsible if there's an accident." When Yan Bingyin, a shunting worker at Neiqiu Station, gave him the same advice, Bai Fengqi said dismissively, "What ability do you have as a shunting worker?" Bai Fengqi's serious violation of labor discipline already constituted a criminal act and had to be punished by law.

    On the day of the sentencing rally, October 17th, more than 860 employee representatives from various units under the Tianjin Railway Administration attended as observers. When Bai Fengqi was escorted to the venue, all the representatives looked at the criminal with indignation. After Ding Shuqi, a representative from the Tianjin Railway Line Special Procuratorate, filed a public prosecution against Bai Fengqi, a representative from the Traffic Safety Inspection Office gave a detailed report on the incident. Lan Keqiang, a representative of the Tianjin Railway Administration employees, also spoke at the meeting, expressing indignation at Bai Fengqi's dereliction of duty and violation of operating procedures, and demanding that the People's Government punish him according to the law. Finally, Judge Liu Yunfeng read out the judgment to the assembly, based on the verified criminal acts of Bai Fengqi through investigation and trial, sentencing him to two years of imprisonment. Xu Hai, the captain of the Third Line Bridge Engineering Team of Neiqiu Station, and Ren Jiming, the instructor-driver of the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot, who were related to the accident, were found to have some responsibility, but not the main responsibility for the accident, and were exempted from criminal punishment. It was recommended that the Tianjin Railway Administration give them appropriate administrative punishment.

    Next, the Tianjin Railway Line Special Court dealt with the case of Yan Jingshan, an assistant personnel officer of the personnel office of Tianjin Station under the Tianjin Railway Administration, who continued to embezzle after the "Three-Anti" movement. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, Yan Jingshan had stolen money, train tickets, and embezzled surplus funds from the sale of goods, totaling more than 600,000 yuan. From September 1952 to mid-June of this year, he continued to embezzle more than 10 million yuan, and absconded with 8 million yuan, squandering it in Qingdao, Shenyang, Jinan, Nanjing, Shanghai and other places with another defendant, Ma Shufang. After the two criminals were arrested on July 26th of this year, they initially refused to confess, but were forced to admit the crimes due to the overwhelming evidence. After a speech by Han Jinjian, a representative of the employees of Tianjin Station, the judge announced that Yan Jingshan would be severely punished for continuing to embezzle after the "Three-Anti" movement, sentencing him to seven years of imprisonment; defendant Ma Shufang was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, suspended for one year.

    After the trial, Zhang Ping, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Railway Administration, spoke. He first expressed his complete support for the court's judgments on the two cases. Then, he explained that the establishment of the Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and Special Procuratorate was absolutely necessary. He called on all employees of the bureau to learn from the lessons of these two cases, abide by state laws and labor discipline, strictly implement operating procedures, establish strict financial and inspection systems, correct bureaucratic work styles, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the task of increasing production and practicing economy!

    重大的责任事故也要受法律处分
    ——记白凤岐违反操作规程造成重大事故案
　  袁行
    我们国家的法律是不容许侵犯的。我们国家的法律为了巩固人民民主的政权，保障国家的经济建设，不允许反革命分子进行任何阴谋活动，同时也不允许任何严重违反劳动纪律、贪污盗窃或破坏国家财产的事件发生。天津铁路沿线专门法院在十月十七日召开宣判大会，宣布白凤岐等因为玩忽职守、违反操作规程而造成的内邱车站重大责任事故案件和阎静山等在“三反”运动后继续贪污案件的判决，就是一个生动的说明。
    白凤岐是天津铁路管理局所属内邱车站第三线桥工程队养路工长。今年六月二十九日，白凤岐在该站二股道岔内方导曲线处做延长股道工程时，不和当地有关方面取得联系，竟严重违反工务暂行养路规则和技术管理规程等，盲目动工，擅自把该道岔枕木间的石碴全部扒出，并拆除控制轨距的霸王铁四根，在酷暑时搁置三天而又没有设任何防护，致使道轨失去纵横水平，失去负力；因而造成七月二日列车脱轨颠覆的重大事故，使国家遭受五亿八千多万元的损失，使十六列车晚点一百三十一小时，严重妨碍了铁路运输。事故发生以前，内邱车站养路工区工长王裕民曾经两次向白凤岐提出“不能拆除霸王铁”，白不但不接受建议，反而说：“你放心吧，出了事故是我们的。”内邱车站工作人员阎炳银给他提出同样的意见时，白凤岐更用轻视的口吻说：“你这个调车员有什么能力。”白凤岐这样严重地违反劳动纪律，已经形成了犯罪行为，必须受到法律处分。
    十月十七日召开宣判大会这天，到会旁听的有天津铁路管理局所属各单位的职工代表八百六十多人。当白凤岐被押解到会场时，全场代表都激愤地看着这个犯罪分子。天津铁路沿线专门检察署代表丁树齐对白凤岐提起公诉之后，行车安全检查室代表对该事件发生经过作了详细报告。天津铁路管理局职工代表兰克强也在会上发言，对白凤岐玩忽职守、违反操作规程的行为表示愤慨，并要求人民政府依法惩办。最后，审判长刘云峰根据对白凤岐调查和审明属实的犯罪行为，向大会宣读判决书，判处有期徒刑二年；和该事故有关的被告内邱车站第三线桥工程队队长徐海和石家庄机务段指导司机任吉明，虽然有一定责任，但不是事故发生的主要责任人，判决免予刑事处分，建议天津铁路管理局酌情给以行政处分。
    接着，天津铁路沿线专门法院处理了天津铁路管理局天津站人事室助理人事干事阎静山在“三反”运动后继续贪污案件。阎静山在“三反”运动以前就偷钱、偷车票和贪污推销货物结余款共达六十多万元。一九五二年九月到今年六月中旬他又陆续贪污一千多万元，并携带八百万元潜逃，和同案另一被告马淑芳到青岛、沈阳、济南、南京、上海等地大肆挥霍。今年七月二十六日该两犯被逮捕归案以后，起初还拒不坦白，后因罪证确凿，才不得不承认。在天津站职工代表韩金鉴发言之后，根据阎犯在“三反”后继续贪污的罪行，审判长宣布对阎静山加重惩办，判处徒刑七年；对被告马淑芳判处徒刑六个月，缓期一年执行。
    审理完毕，由天津铁路管理局张萍副局长讲话。他首先表示完全拥护法院对这两个案件的判决。接着，他说明天津铁路沿线专门法院和专门检察署的成立是十分必要的。他号召全局职工要接受这两个案件的教训，遵守国家法律和劳动纪律，严格执行操作规程，建立严格的财务制度和检查制度，纠正官僚主义作风，为完成和超额完成增产节约的任务而奋斗！
