    "Liu Yumei truly deserves to be a good representative of the people"
        Liu Yumei, a model worker from the explosives factory of Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine, is the deputy chief of the explosives management section. She was elected as a people's representative in the general election. On the day she was elected, she said to everyone, "Since the comrades trust me and elected me, I will definitely rely on everyone to handle everyone's affairs well."
        After the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign began, all the mine's employees proposed to increase production and save 150,000 tons of coal for the country. Obviously, to increase coal production, a steady supply of explosives was needed to prepare the stripping conditions so that coal miners could vigorously mine. Therefore, she worked with the technicians in the workshop to improve the operation methods, combining the handling and loading of explosives, and changing the detonator team from three shifts to two shifts. In this way, the output of water cannons was greatly increased and the quality was ensured, achieving "fast, good, and economical." They proposed to the stripping section: "We will supply as many water cannons as you need! We will never let you stop stripping because of the lack of water cannons." This encouraged the production enthusiasm of the stripping section workers.
        Due to the change in water cannon operation time, female workers with children had to bring their children at seven o'clock every day. Liu Yumei temporarily helped take care of them before the nursery staff arrived. The workers reflected, "Liu Yumei truly deserves to be a good representative of the people!" (Jiang Xing)
    "This is a good thing Representative Xue Shengbao did for everyone"
        Last year, the people of Yaodian Township, Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, had to send their public grain to Gaojiawan warehouse, which was 150 miles away. As a result, the transportation and miscellaneous expenses incurred by the masses amounted to more than 16 million yuan. The masses expressed their opinions to People's Representative Xue Shengbao. Some said, "Paying public grain delays four days of work, and even delays collecting firewood and plowing." Some said, "Paying one dou of public grain requires five sheng of transportation and miscellaneous expenses, which is unbearable." After listening to these opinions, Xue Shengbao thought: Why should people be asked to pay public grain so far away, causing everyone to suffer such great losses? He discussed this issue with the masses and decided to submit the proposal to the county people's congress for discussion. After approval from the higher authorities, it was decided to change the public grain of Yaodian Township to Yan'an County warehouse, which was 50 miles away, and Ganguyi warehouse, which was 30 miles away. This year, when the masses paid the summer loan grain, it only took half a day for the round trip, which not only did not delay work but also saved transportation and miscellaneous expenses. Everyone reflected: This is a good thing Representative Xue Shengbao did for everyone.
        Xue Shengbao is forty-nine years old this year and has been re-elected as a people's representative of the township and county for fifteen years. People respectfully call him "Old Representative." He was originally from Yulin County, northern Shaanxi, and came to Kangjiagou Village at the age of twenty-three to escape famine and worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord. In 1935, he joined the poor peasant association, and the following year he became a Communist Party member. For more than ten years, he has been concerned about the lives of the masses and enthusiastically handled affairs for the masses.
        This year, Yaodian Township conducted a general election, and the voters of Kangjiagou electoral district elected him as a township people's representative. After Xue Shengbao was elected, he worked even more actively. Because Kangjiagou farmer He Manyu's illness delayed weeding, he immediately mobilized twelve laborers to help He Manyu finish the second weeding on time. In the payment of summer loan grain, Xue Shengbao first automatically paid his due public grain and led the masses of the whole village to complete the amount of loan grain for the whole village in one day. He said: In the future, we must unite more closely with the masses and do a better job of handling the people's affairs.
    "Thanks to Old Wang, we are not afraid of not being able to bring back the crops this time"
        People in Fuxing Village, Shengguo Village, Wuchang County, Songjiang Province, are saying: "Wang Yushu is our good representative, who can really handle affairs for us!"
        Wang Yushu is forty-six years old this year, a Communist Party member, and he had spent half his life in hardship in the old society.
        The First National People's Congress passed the resolution on rectifying mutual aid teams, accumulating fertilizer, and preparing for the autumn harvest. After he returned to the village, he immediately conveyed it and took the lead in implementing it. The four mutual aid teams in the whole village clamored to disband because of uneven division of labor and weak leadership during summer hoeing. Wang Yushu immediately went to each group to help solve the problems. When the work of accumulating fertilizer began, some people thought: "Fertilizer is not needed on the mountain ridge, the floor is strong, and applying fertilizer is useless, it will be washed away by water after rain." Some people also thought: "The manure was all cleaned up last year, and there is nothing to accumulate this year." After he discovered this situation, he first pressed green manure on the mountain to educate those who were unwilling to accumulate fertilizer with facts.
        When Wang Yushu was working or visiting various households, he could always pay attention to understanding the difficulties and demands of the masses in production and life, and reported to the government at any time. During the autumn harvest this year in Fuxing Village, there were many horses but few carts, and many people were worried that the crops would not be brought back; they wanted to buy large carts but had no money. Wang Yushu immediately told the village chief about this and ran to the supply and marketing cooperative 15 miles away from the village three times to contact them, requesting the cooperative to lend two large carts to the mutual aid team. The masses were all satisfied with this. Someone said, "Thanks to Old Wang, we are not afraid of not being able to bring back the crops this time!"
        Wang Yushu is also a forest protection committee member. During the slack season, many people went up the mountain to collect firewood and pick grapes. When he met everyone on the road, he always told them like this: "Be careful of fire when entering the forest. Don't step on the newly planted saplings..."
    "Representative Liu is really careful, worrying so much for me"
        At the first township people's congress in Hanyang Township, Jiange County, Sichuan Province, the issue of leading farmers to do a good job in autumn production was emphasized. After Township People's Representative Liu Xingyu returned to the village, he found that twelve farmers in Qili Village lacked draught cattle, which made autumn plowing difficult. Liu Xingyu immediately discussed and studied with the village cadres, mobilizing the masses to exchange labor or buy more draught cattle. For example, farmer Yang Lan lacked five laborers, so he exchanged labor with Qi Jianhuai, a farmer who lacked cattle, with draught cattle, and the problems of the two families were solved.
        At this time, the People's Bank sent people to Qili Village to issue loans for draught cattle, and Liu Xingyu actively tried to help the most difficult households lacking cattle to obtain loans to purchase draught cattle. Some farmers bought one head jointly. Farmers Wei Zhanhuai and Wei Zongbing lacked 300,000 yuan and could not buy cattle, so Liu Xingyu introduced them to the cooperative to transport salt. Liu Xingyu also introduced Liu Chunhong, a farmer who lacked cattle, to repair farm tools in other villages in order to buy draught cattle with wages. Liu Chunhong said with emotion, "Representative Liu is really careful, worrying so much for me!"
    "With such representatives elected, production will surely be improved"
        After the general election in Fuling Prefecture, Sichuan Province, the cadres received a profound education, improved their leadership style, and actively led the masses to produce, thus winning the support of the masses.
        The township cadres of Shixi Township, Shizhu County, changed their simplistic work style in autumn production, went deep into reality, and proposed and solved problems according to different situations, which promoted autumn production. After the general election, the district arranged autumn plowing and planting for the first time. The cadres changed their past "one-size-fits-all" work method and worked according to the different situations in different regions. At that time, the masses in the plains had a relaxing mentality after harvesting the rice, and the preparations for autumn plowing and planting were very poor. Some households lacked labor, and some households lacked draught cattle. The farmers in the mountainous areas who were harvesting also believed that the weather was good, and it did not matter if they harvested and collected slowly, and they did not pay attention to autumn plowing and planting. According to this situation, the cadres decided to lead the farmers to actively prepare for autumn plowing and planting in the areas where the harvest was completed, and help the masses solve the problems of draught cattle, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers; in the large mountainous areas where the harvest was in progress, they educated the farmers to continue to rush to harvest. After the policy was decided, the cadres went deep into the masses again to solve the problems in production for everyone. Farmer Hu Jiaquan saw that others did not have cattle to plow the fields and was unwilling to rent out his draught cattle, so the cadres patiently educated Hu Jiaquan.
        It rained continuously for three days in Fuling County in September. This was a good time for autumn plowing, and the long-dried field ridges were moistened. Zhang Hongming, director of the village representative of Shima Village, did not wait for the rain to stop, and took the lead in going down to the field, blocking the water and plowing the field. Under his influence, many farmers in the village got up to pound the field ridges. A total of thirty-six stone slab fields were plowed in the whole village. Farmer Jiang Qiwen said happily:
    "Such a people's representative is really not wrongly elected!" The villagers all reflected: "With such representatives elected, production will surely be improved."

    把人民的事情办得更好
  “刘玉梅真不愧为人民的好代表”
    抚顺露天煤矿火药厂劳动模范刘玉梅，是火药管理股的副股长，她在普选中当选了人民代表。在她当选的那一天，她向大家表示：“同志们既然相信我，把我选出来，我一定依靠大家把大伙的事办好。”
    增产节约运动开始后，全矿职工提出要给国家增产节约十五万吨煤。很明显，要增产煤就得源源供应火药，把剥离条件准备好，使采煤工人能大力开采。于是，她就和车间技术人员共同研究，改进操作方法，把搬运与装药组合并起来，把导线组由三班倒改为二班。这样，水炮的产量就大大提高了，并保证了质量，做到“又快、又好、又省”。他们向剥离段提出：“要多少水炮，我们就供给多少！绝不让你们因水炮供不上而停止剥离。”这样就鼓舞了剥离段工人的生产热情。
    由于改变了水炮作业时间，有孩子的女工都得在每天七点把孩子带来，刘玉梅就在保育员来到以前临时帮助照管。工人们反映：“刘玉梅真不愧为人民的好代表！”（姜兴）
    “这是薛生堡代表给大家办的好事”
    陕西省延安县姚店乡人民，去年缴公粮时，要送到一百五十里外的高家?仓库去，因此群众来回所花的运费和盘费达一千六百多万元。群众纷纷向人民代表薛生堡提出了意见。有的说：“缴一回公粮误了四天工，连打柴翻地都耽误了。”有的说：“缴一斗公粮就得出五升运费和盘费，这还受得了。”薛生堡听了这些意见，就想着：为什么要叫人到这么远的地方去缴公粮，让大家受到那么大的损失。他和群众研究了这个问题，决定把提案交县人民代表会议讨论。经上级批准后，决定把姚店乡的公粮改交到五十里外的延安县仓库和三十里外的甘谷驿仓库。今年群众交夏借粮时，来回只用了半天的时间，既不误工又节省了运费和盘费。大伙都反映：这是薛生堡代表给大家办的好事。
    薛生堡今年四十九岁，已经连任了十五年的乡和县的人民代表，人们都以“老代表”尊称他。他原是陕北榆林县人，二十三岁上逃荒来到了康家沟村，给地主扛长活。一九三五年他参加了贫农团，第二年就成了共产党员。十几年来他一直关心群众生活，热心为群众办事。
    今年姚店乡进行了普选，康家沟选区的选民们，都选他为乡人民代表。薛生堡当选后，工作更加积极了。康家沟农民贺满玉因生病耽误了锄草，他立刻动员了十二个劳动力，帮助贺满玉按时锄完了第二遍草。在缴纳夏借粮中，薛生堡首先自动缴出自己应借的公粮，并带动全村群众在一天内完成了全村的应借公粮数。他表示：今后更要和群众紧密团结，把人民的事情办得更好。
    “多亏老王，这回不怕拉不回庄稼了”
    松江省五常县胜国村复兴屯的人们都在说：“王玉书是咱们的好代表，真能给咱们办事！”
    王玉书今年四十六岁，共产党员，他曾在旧社会里过了半辈子苦日子。
    第一次人民代表大会通过了整顿互助组、积肥及做好秋收准备工作的决议。他回屯后即进行传达，并带头执行。全屯四个互助组在夏锄时因分工不匀和领导弱，都嚷着要散伙。王玉书即深入各组，帮助解决问题。积肥工作开始时，有人认为：“山岗地不用上粪，地板壮，上粪也是白扯，一下雨就被水冲跑了。”有的人又认为：“粪在去年都起净了，今年没啥可积的。”他发现这个情况以后，自己先在山上压上绿肥，用事实去教育不愿积肥的人。
    王玉书在干活或到各家串门时，能随时注意了解群众生产上和生活上的困难和要求，并随时向政府反映。复兴屯今年秋收时，马多车少，很多人担心庄稼拉不回来；想买大车又没钱。王玉书马上把这事告诉了村长，并三次跑到离屯十五里地的供销合作社去联系，要求合作社贷给了互助组两台大车。群众对这都表示满意，有人说：“多亏老王，这回不怕拉不回庄稼了！”
    王玉书又是护林委员。挂锄期间，许多人上山打柴、采葡萄，他在路上碰到大伙时，总是这样嘱咐：“进林子要小心防火。遇到新栽的小树，可别踩坏了，……”
    “刘代表真仔细，为我操这么大的心”
    四川省剑阁县汉阳乡在第一次乡人民代表大会上，曾着重讨论了领导农民作好秋季生产工作的问题。乡人民代表刘兴玉回村后，发现七里村全村有十二户农民缺乏耕牛，秋耕有困难。刘兴玉当即和村里的干部讨论研究，发动群众变工互助，或添买耕牛。例如，农民杨兰缺乏五个劳动力，便以耕牛和缺牛的农民戚见怀换工，两家的问题就解决了。
    这时，人民银行派人到七里村来发放耕牛贷款，刘兴玉便积极设法让最困难的缺牛户取得贷款购买耕牛。有的农户几家合买一头。农民魏占怀和魏宗炳两人缺少三十万元，不能买牛，刘兴玉便介绍他们给合作社运盐。刘兴玉还介绍缺牛农民刘春洪到外村修理农具，以工资购买耕牛。刘春洪感动地说：“刘代表真仔细，为我操这么大的心！”
    “选上这样的代表，生产准能搞好”
    四川省涪陵专区普选后，干部受到了一次深刻的教育，改进了领导作风，积极领导群众生产，因而得到了群众的拥护。
    石砫县石溪乡乡干部，在秋季生产中改变简单化的工作作风，深入实际，根据不同情况，提出问题解决问题，推动了秋季生产。普选后区里第一次布置秋耕秋种，干部们改变了过去“一揽子兜”的工作方法，按照不同地区的不同情况进行工作。当时，平坝地区的群众在打完谷子后有松劲思想，秋耕秋种的准备工作做得很差，有的户缺劳动力，有的户缺耕牛。正在收割中的山地农民思想上也认为天时好，慢割、慢收不要紧，对秋耕秋种也不注意。干部们根据这个情况，决定在收割完了的地区，领导农民积极准备秋耕秋种，帮助群众解决耕牛、农具、种子、肥料问题；在正在收割的大山地区，教育农民继续抢收。方针决定后，干部又深入群众中，给大家解决生产方面的问题。农民胡家全看着别人没牛耕田，不愿意把耕牛租出去，干部便耐心地对胡家全进行了教育。
    涪陵县在九月间连下了三天绵雨。这正是秋耕的好时候，久干的田坎都润湿了。石马村村代表主任张洪明没有等到雨停，就带头下田，堵水犁了田。在他的影响下，村里很多农民都起来捶田坎。全村共犁了三十六石板田。农民姜启文高兴地说：
  “这样的人民代表真是没有错选呀！”村里人都反映：“选上这样的代表，生产准能搞好。”
