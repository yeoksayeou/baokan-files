    The Immortal People on Mount Kumgang
    Zhi Wen

    June 25th of this year marked the third anniversary of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression. On this morning, the Korean residents living in Gye-dong near Mount Kumgang, dressed in new clothes and carrying offerings, supported the old and led the young to the two graves at the foot of Mount Kumgang. The color of the soil of the graves seemed unchanged, and wild grass had grown in some places. People carefully removed the weeds and evenly spread a layer of new soil on the graves. A new straw mat was laid in front of the graves, and the elementary school students scattered the fresh flowers they had collected in the morning on the graves. In an instant, the graves seemed to turn into huge floral crowns. Then, one by one, people placed the offerings they had brought in front of the graves. A young woman named Lee Ho-gil knelt solemnly in front of the graves, offering food and wine completely according to Korean sacrificial customs. Then, people stepped to the rhythm of slow drumbeats and danced around the graves. After the dance, Lee Ho-gil also took her two-year-old child and erected a large wooden plaque in front of the grave. At this time, an old man named Lee Seol-jae, over sixty years old, with an aged face carrying both excitement and sorrow, respectfully walked to the tomb and wrote on the large wooden plaque: "The righteousness between father and son, a righteousness difficult to perform; the affection between blood brothers, an affection difficult to bestow. The neighborly friendship is most sincere and deep. Zhang and Lü gave their lives to save people. In the fierce mountain fire, their great righteousness soared to the sky. Though their bodies are dead, their names will remain for a thousand years. Mount Kumgang stands tall, Lü and Zhang's great righteousness will endure forever."
    Who are these Zhang and Lü? How did they sacrifice themselves to save people?
    The incident occurred on April 21st. On that morning, enemy planes attacked Mount Kumgang, and the mountain forest caught fire, spreading everywhere. The Korean people and volunteer soldiers living in Gye-dong at the foot of the mountain rushed up the mountain to fight the fire upon hearing the "clang, clang..." of the bell. Among the firefighters, in addition to the volunteer soldiers, there were also many Korean women and children. They loved the buildings and pine forests on the mountain, they loved every inch of land and stone on the mountain, and they did not want to watch the famous scenic spots of their motherland turn into ashes. However, the wind carried the fire, and the fire rode on the wind, burning even more fiercely. The firefighting crowd extinguished the fire here, but it ignited again there. In the smoke and flames, those volunteer soldiers were truly like lively dragons and tigers, extinguishing the fire in one place and then extinguishing the fire in another. They were not only worried about the loss of this scenic spot in Korea, but also worried about the Korean women and children who had come to fight the fire regardless of their own safety. At this time, the fire was particularly intense near Namsan Ridge. There were four sixteen or seventeen-year-old girls who were surrounded by fire because they could not escape in time. They only heard the crackling of the trees burning all around and above their heads, and they only saw a blaze of fire. Their heads began to feel dizzy and their eyes became blurred. Just when they were at their wit's end and calling for help loudly, two volunteer soldiers rolled down from the gaps in the trees where the flames were flying. While patting the sparks on their bodies, they pulled the four girls out of the area where the flames were thin. The names of these four girls were: Shin Hyun-hwa, Jung Kyung-nam, Lee Jung-sook, and Kil Si-ja. Before they could even ask who had saved them, they saw them rushing back to the place where the fire was burning fiercely as if they were flying. These two soldiers were Lü Yu-jiu and Zhang Ming-lu from the 2nd squad of the 3rd company of the volunteer army's stretcher team. Following closely behind them to Namsan Ridge were platoon leader Wang Xiuqi and soldier Liu Shaowen. Liu Shaowen ran ahead. He only saw Lü Yu-jiu and Zhang Ming-lu pouncing toward the mountain depression, and immediately saw a cloud of thick smoke and flames rushing from the mountain depression towards him. Liu Shaowen hurriedly shouted: "The fire is too big, Lü Yu-jiu, Zhang Ming-lu, quickly go..." He turned around and ran, but fainted after only a few steps. Platoon leader Wang Xiuqi happened to arrive and helped him up. At this time, a large patch of Liu Shaowen's hair had been burned off, and a burn mark appeared on his face. Liu Shaowen had just regained consciousness when he anxiously waved his hand and said, "Put me down and save the fire, go find Lü Yu-jiu and Zhang Ming-lu." Seeing that Liu Shaowen had regained consciousness, platoon leader Wang Xiuqi ran towards the place Liu Shaowen pointed to. The fire was still burning. Wang Xiuqi ran around to the bottom of the mountain depression, but did not see Lü Yu-jiu and Zhang Ming-lu. Suddenly, he heard the sound of women crying far away from somewhere down the mountain stream: "Come quickly! Come quickly! Volunteer comrades..." He hurriedly ran towards the sound. It turned out that these were four Korean women: Lee Ho-gil, Choi Chun-bong, Kim Seong-ok, and Jung Ok-nam. They first fought the fire on Buksan Ridge, and after putting out the fire there, they arrived at Namsan Ridge before Lü Yu-jiu and Zhang Ming-lu. They saw that a fire had started near the volunteer army's air-raid shelter in the mountain stream, and worried that it would burn the things stored in the air-raid shelter, so they ran down to extinguish the burning flames. However, in an instant, the trees above the mountain stream caught fire, the smoke became thicker and thicker, and the fire became bigger and bigger. The raging fire扑向them from all directions. They didn't know where to rush to, and just when they were in danger, they suddenly felt someone pushing them out from behind, and soon they reached a place where the smoke was thin. They had just caught their breath and calmed down, and turned around to see who had saved them, only to see the backs of two volunteer soldiers disappearing into the thick smoke, and they never saw them come out again. These four Korean women were extremely anxious and at a loss. They walked closer to the places where the flames were weakening for a while, and stared at the depths of the flames for a while. They eagerly hoped that two people would rush out from there again, but all they saw was smoke and fire. It was not until the fire gradually began to die down that they did not see the two volunteer soldiers coming out. They could no longer wait, so they ran into the woods that were still smoking. They wanted to encounter something, but they were also afraid of encountering something. Finally, the unfortunate thing was confirmed. The two volunteer soldiers who saved their lives died in the fire. Only then could they not suppress their grief and burst into tears. Platoon leader Wang Xiuqi and several other soldiers followed the crying and found this place. Seeing the scene of their comrades bravely sacrificing their lives, and listening to the Korean women narrating the facts of these two martyrs bravely rescuing them, they could not help but shed tears.
    When Lee Ho-gil returned home, her two-year-old child threw his small arms into her arms. Lee Ho-gil hugged the child tightly, and while shedding tears, she solemnly said to the child who still didn't understand: "Child! You must remember the volunteer army uncle. If it weren't for them, you would never see your mother again!" When Lee Ho-gil's mother-in-law heard her daughter-in-law say this, she looked at her daughter-in-law's burnt hair and immediately burst into tears. She wanted to go to the volunteer army unit immediately to find the martyrs' photos to see what these two heroes looked like, and at the same time, she wanted to inquire about the hometown addresses of the martyrs to write letters to their relatives to comfort them.
    On August 22nd, representatives from various villages, representatives from the Korean Workers' Party and the county People's Committee, and representatives from the volunteer army unit where the two martyrs had served held a joint memorial service and monument erection ceremony. A tall stone monument inscribed with the words "The Great Internationalist Warriors Lü Yu-jiu and Zhang Ming-lu's Heroic Names Will Last Forever" stood on a small mountain in Hancun, surrounded by verdant pines and cypresses, symbolizing the immortality of these two martyrs. On the same day, the women's production commando team, organized by the eight women rescued by the two martyrs and named after the martyrs, also took an oath in front of the monument:
    "Most beloved benefactors, Comrades Lü Yu-jiu and Zhang Ming-lu, your great internationalist spirit will forever live in our hearts. In order to inherit your legacy of fighting for the cause of peace, we guarantee: we will never tarnish your names. We will hold high the red flag of the production commando team with your names written on it, and move forward forever in the cause of restoring and building our motherland." (Attached picture)

    金刚山上不朽的人  
    志文
    今年六月二十五日，是朝鲜反侵略战争三周年的日子。这天上午，住在金刚山附近稼洞里的朝鲜居民，换了新衣，顶着祭品，扶老携幼地来到金刚山麓的两座坟墓面前。坟墓的土色仿佛未变，有的地方已经长出野草，人们把野草精心地铲掉，又在墓上均匀地培了一层新土，墓前铺上一块新稻草席，小学生们把早晨采集的鲜花撒到墓上，霎时坟墓仿佛变成了巨大的花冠。于是人们一一把自己带来的祭品摆在墓前，一个年轻的妇女李护吉严肃地跪在墓前，完全按着朝鲜的祭奠习惯献饭，敬酒。接着人们就踏着缓慢的鼓声的节拍，围着墓地跳起舞来。跳舞毕，李护吉又拉着自己的两周岁的孩子，把一块经过精心制作的大木牌立在墓前，这时，一位名叫李雪载的六十多岁的老人的苍老的脸上，带着又是激动又是悲戚的神色，必恭必敬地走到墓前，在大木牌上挥笔写道：“亲父子之间之义，此义难行之义，骨肉兄弟之情，此情亦难施之情。邻国之谊，至切且深，张、吕二君，舍身救人，山火烈处，大义冲天，身虽死去，千载留名。金刚山容攀天立，吕张大义万古存。”
    这张、吕二君是谁？他们如何舍身救人的呢？
    事情发生在四月二十一日。当天上午敌机袭击了金刚山，山林起火，到处蔓延，住在山下稼洞里的朝鲜人民和志愿军战士随着“当当……”的钟声，赶上山来救火。在救火的人群中，除了志愿军战士，还有不少的朝鲜妇女和儿童，他们爱这山上的建筑和松林，爱这山上的一土一石，他们不愿眼看着自己祖国的名胜化为灰烬。可是，风卷着火，火乘着风，愈烧愈大，救火的人群扑灭了这处，那处又燃烧起来。在烟卷火舌中，那些志愿军的战士，真像生龙活虎一般，扑灭了一处火，又扑灭另一处火，他们不光在为朝鲜这一风景名胜的损失担心，还在为奋不顾身赶来救火的朝鲜妇女和儿童担心。这时紧靠南山梁上的火势正紧，那里有四个十六、七岁的女孩子因为救火不及，被火包围了。她们只听得四周和头顶树木烧得噼噼拍拍地响，只看到一片火光，头开始发晕，眼也发花了。正在走头无路、大声呼叫的当儿，从火舌飞舞的树隙中，滚下来两个志愿军战士，他们一边拍打着身上的火星子，一边拉着这四个女孩子从火苗稀薄的地方冲了出去。这四个女孩子的名字叫：申铉花、郑景男、李郑淑、吉时子，她们还来不及打听救了她们的是谁，只见他们飞也似地又向大火燃烧的地方跑去了。这两个战士就是志愿军某部担架队三连二排的吕玉久和张明禄，紧跟着他俩来到南梁上的还有排长王秀棋和战士刘绍文。刘绍文跑在前面，他只看到吕玉久和张明禄向山坳处扑去，登时只见一片浓烟烈焰，从山坳那边扑到他身上来了。刘绍文连忙喊道：“火大了，吕玉久、张明禄快往……”扭过头就跑，没跑了几步便昏倒了，排长王秀棋正好赶到把他扶起，这时刘绍文的头发已被烧去一大块，脸上出现了一片烧伤。刘绍文刚刚清醒过来便着急地挥着手说：“快把我放下去救火，去找吕玉久和张明禄。”排长王秀棋看着刘绍文清醒过来了，就向刘绍文手指的地方跑去。大火还在燃烧着，王秀棋绕着跑到山坳下面，并不见吕玉久和张明禄。突然，听见山涧下面远远的什么地方，有妇女哭叫的声音：“快来呀！快来呀！志愿军同志……”。他就连忙顺着声音跑去。原来这是四个朝鲜妇女：李护吉、崔春凤、金成玉、郑玉男。她们先在北山梁上救火，把那里的火扑灭了以后，就在吕玉久和张明禄之先赶到了南山梁上，她们看到山涧里志愿军的防空洞附近着了火，耽心会烧了防空洞里储藏的东西，就跑下来扑打燃着的火苗。可是，霎时之间，山涧上面的树木都着了火，烟愈来愈浓、火愈来愈大，烈火四面八方劈头盖顶地扑向她们，她们也不知道冲向那里是好，正在危急之际，忽然，她们觉得有人从后面推着她们跑了出来，很快到了烟气稀薄的地方。她们刚喘过了气，定了定神，回过头来想看看救了她们的是谁，只见两个志愿军战士的背影又消失在浓烟里面去了，一直再没看到他们出来。这四个朝鲜妇女万分焦急不知所措，一会走近火焰微弱下去的地方，一会凝视着火焰的深处，她们急切地盼望着会有两个人再从那里冲出来，但她们看到的不是烟就是火，一直到大火渐渐要熄灭下去了，还不见那两个志愿军战士出来。她们再也不能等待，就向还在冒烟的树林里奔去，她们又想碰到什么，但又害怕碰到什么。终于，不幸的事情被证实了。救了她们生命的两位志愿军战士在烈火中牺牲了。她们这才压制不住自己的沉痛，失声哭叫起来。排长王秀棋和另外几个战士顺着哭声找到这里，看到自己的战友英勇牺牲了的情景，听了朝鲜妇女叙述这两位烈士奋勇抢救她们的事实，也不禁掉下泪来。
    李护吉回到家里，她那两岁的小孩张着两只小手扑到她的怀里，李护吉把孩子紧紧地抱起，一面流着眼泪，一面郑重地对着还不懂事的孩子说道：“孩子呀！你要记住志愿军叔叔，不是他们，你就再也见不着妈妈了！”李护吉的婆婆听媳妇这么一说，看着媳妇被烧坏的头发，立时放声大哭起来，她要马上到志愿军部队去找烈士的照片，看看这两位英雄是什么模样，同时还要打听烈士的家乡住址，给烈士的亲人写信安慰他们。
    八月二十二日，当地各里的代表、朝鲜劳动党和郡人民委员会的代表以及两位烈士生前所在志愿军部队的代表联合举行追悼大会和立碑仪式。一块高大的刻着“伟大国际主义战士吕玉久、张明禄英名千古”字样的石碑，耸立在汗村里的一个小山上，四周苍松翠柏，象征着这两位烈士的永垂不朽。当天，由两位烈士救出的八名妇女组织的，并以烈士的名字命名的妇女生产突击队还在碑前宣了誓：
    “最敬爱的恩人，吕玉久、张明禄二位同志，你们伟大的国际主义精神，永远活在我们的心里。为了继承你们为和平事业斗争的遗志，我们保证：决不辱没你们的名字，我们要高举写着你们名字的生产突击队的红旗，在恢复和建设祖国的事业中永远前进。”（附图片）
