Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 4th: After Indian troops arrested the special agent murderers of Zhang Zilong in Camp No. 28 on the 2nd, on the evening of the same day, special agent chiefs dispatched by the U.S. side to other camps went to Camp No. 28 to hold a meeting, appoint agents to represent the murderers, and make new arrangements for sabotage and "explanation" work. This was revealed today at Panmunjom by two Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel, Yu Wanming and Zhou Jingshan, after returning from explanation sessions.

Yu Wanming and Zhou Jingshan personally witnessed about ten special agents, including the "regimental commander" of Block D and "battalion commanders" and "company commanders" from other camps, holding a meeting in Camp No. 28 on the evening of the 2nd. After the meeting, the Kuomintang special agent, the "Captain of the First Company," said to all the POWs:

	"From now on, I will be the acting battalion commander. Although some of us have been 'transferred away,' we still cannot let a single person escape!" Following this, the special agents intensified their efforts to deploy sabotage of the explanation work. Throughout the 3rd, the special agent elements sharpened the razor blades they had hidden in their boots. Every "guard," and "squad leader" was ordered to carry one. The groups of ten people each, mutually monitoring each other, were reorganized. The special agents threatened the POWs, saying, "As long as you dare to say you want to be repatriated, you will be caught and killed!"

	In addition, the special agents used so-called "psychological warfare" to make the POWs extremely fearful. On the evening of the 3rd, the special agents forced the POWs to hold non-stop meetings, with battalions, companies, platoons, and squads all holding meetings, lasting for four hours. The POWs heard the same intimidation and deception. As soon as the POWs had fallen asleep, the special agents called them up one by one and asked: "Do you want to return home? Don't even think about living!" Yu Wanming and Zhou Jingshan were both called up and questioned twice last night. Each time after being questioned, they were so frightened that they couldn't sleep for a long time, leading to extreme mental fatigue and confusion.

Yu Wanming and others also said that, even before listening to the explanation today, they saw a special agent who served as the "regimental headquarters secretary" and a fat "battalion commander" from another camp outside the explanation tent. These guys paced back and forth outside the explanation tent, and whenever they saw a POW, they fiercely threatened them, saying, "Anyone who wants to leave shouldn't think about living."

Returning at the same time as Yu Wanming and Zhou Jingshan were seven Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel who testified before the Neutral Nations Investigating Teams about the murder of Zhang Zilong by special agents, and one Korean People's Army captured soldier who escaped from the barbed wire yesterday and applied for repatriation. During the individual interviews by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission this morning, the seven Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel who testified all described in detail the facts they had witnessed regarding the murder of Zhang Zilong and the destruction of evidence by Kuomintang special agents. What they said was consistent with what the twenty-three captured personnel from our side who returned the previous two days had said.

### 美方特务加紧控制第二十八号营场的战俘  其他营场的特务头子公然前往布置破坏解释工作

    美方特务加紧控制第二十八号营场的战俘
    其他营场的特务头子公然前往布置破坏解释工作
    【新华社开城四日电】在印度部队二日逮捕了第二十八号营场内谋杀张子龙案件的凶手特务后，当天晚上，就有美方派到其他营场的特务头子到第二十八号营场开会，指定凶手特务的代理人，并对破坏解释工作作新的布置。这是今天经解释后归来的两名中国人民志愿军被俘人员余万明、周景山在板门店揭露的。
    余万明和周景山在二日晚上，亲眼看到D号营区的“联队长”、其他营场的“大队长”、“中队长”等共十来个特务到第二十八号营场开会。开会后，“一中队队长”国民党特务就对全体战俘说：
  “现在由我代理大队长。虽然我们有些人被‘调走’了，我们仍旧不能让一个人逃走！”接着，特务们就加紧布置破坏解释工作。在三日一天中，特务分子把藏在皮靴里带进来的刀片磨得更锋利，每一个“警备队员”、“班长”都奉命带上一把。以十个人为一组的互相监视的小组重新作了调整。特务们威胁战俘说：“只要你们敢说出愿意遣返，捉住就杀！”
    除此之外，特务还用所谓“心理战”的办法，使战俘极端恐惧。在三日晚上，特务们强迫战俘不停歇地开会，大队、中队、分队、小队都要开，一直开了四个钟头，战俘们所听到的都是同样的恐吓和欺骗。等到战俘刚刚睡下，特务们又把他们一个个叫起来问：“你想回国吗？你就别想活了！”在昨天夜里，余万明和周景山都被叫起来问过两次。每一次问过之后，都使他们恐惧得好久睡不着觉，以致精神极度疲劳和混乱。
    余万明等并说，就在今天听解释以前，他们在解释帐篷外还看到了一个充当“联队部书记”的特务分子和一个胖胖的其他营场的“大队长”。这些家伙在解释帐篷外踱来踱去，一见到战俘就凶狠地恐吓说：“谁想走，就别想活。”
    与余万明、周景山同时归来的，还有在中立国调查人员面前对特务谋杀张子龙案件作证的七名中国人民志愿军被俘人员和昨天逃出铁丝网申请遣返的一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员。在今天上午中立国遣返委员会个别询问时，这七名作证的中国人民志愿军被俘人员都详细地叙述了他们所目击的国民党特务谋杀张子龙和消灭罪证的事实。他们所讲的和前两天归来的二十三名我方被俘人员所说的情形相符合。
