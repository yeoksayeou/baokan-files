    Integrating Procurement with Political Work:
    Various Regions Strengthen Leadership in Grain Procurement

Since October, the Chinese Communist Party committees and government financial departments in various regions across the country have further strengthened their leadership over grain procurement work. At the same time, various regions have begun to integrate procurement work with propaganda and education work among farmers.

During this period, rice and various coarse grains were the most available grains on the market. These autumn crops account for a large proportion of China's total grain output. In a considerable number of areas, sorghum, corn, millet, and other grains are still the main food for farmers, or food for the people to adjust. When various autumn grains were put on the market in large quantities, in addition to state-owned trade and cooperative departments continuing to do a good job in supplying materials to meet the "selling to buy" characteristics of farmers, local CCP committees and government financial departments strengthened their leadership over grain procurement work. The Shandong Sub-bureau of the CCP Central Committee convened a grain conference. After the meeting, Party committees at all levels in Shandong conveyed the spirit of grain procurement work to grassroots grain stations. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the CCP instructed its subordinate Party committees at all levels to list grain procurement as the central task for October, and the Provincial Finance Committee convened a grain conference to make specific arrangements. The Grain Bureau of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government convened a joint meeting of the directors of grain bureaus and managers of grain companies in various special districts, with the participation of the directors of cooperatives in the special districts, and decided to further carry out autumn grain procurement work. The CCP committees in Wenzhou, Ningbo, Jinhua, and other special districts in Zhejiang Province explained the great significance of grain procurement to the national economy and the people's livelihood to the cadres engaged in grain procurement work through various meetings. The Yanggao County Committee of the CCP in Shanxi Province convened a joint meeting of district party secretaries to deploy this work. After the mobilization and deployment of Party committees in various regions, financial departments also strengthened the organization of procurement work. People's governments in Sichuan and Hunan provinces and parts of Jiangsu and Jiangxi provinces established joint procurement organizations such as "Grain Procurement Committees" or "Autumn Grain Procurement Offices." Rural cooperatives in Hunan, Jiangsu, Shaanxi and other places increased procurement stations to eliminate grain procurement blank areas. Huanggang and Xiaogan Special Districts in Hubei Province have added more than 400 grain procurement stations in rural areas. At the same time, Party committees and government departments in various regions have also strengthened the inspection of grain procurement work. The Fuzhou and Shangrao Regional Offices and Party Committees in Jiangxi Province extracted a large number of cadres from directly affiliated agencies to form fourteen inspection teams, led by the secretaries of the CCP regional committees and commissioners, respectively, to inspect grain procurement work in various counties.

Combining political work with procurement work is the key to completing the grain procurement task. The Party and grain procurement departments in Taigu, Ruicheng, and Yanggao counties in Shanxi Province, Xingguo in Jiangxi Province, and Wendeng in Shandong Province used mass meetings, symposiums, blackboards, and loudspeakers to explain to farmers the benefits of selling grain, expanding production investment, and the state vigorously purchasing grain to stabilize prices and support industrial construction. In Lichuan County, Jiangxi Province, grain procurement work teams were established in various districts, and under the leadership of the people's governments of various districts and townships, they carried out in-depth propaganda to make these principles known to every household. The People's Government of Hengnan County, Hunan Province, convened a meeting of people's representatives from all walks of life. The representatives discussed grain procurement work and conveyed this work to farmers throughout the county. The Shaoxing County Committee of the CCP convened a meeting of propagandists and launched extensive propaganda activities through rural propagandists. The cooperative-convened member representative meetings in Lingbao in Henan, a major cotton-producing area, and Anyang Special District, carried out propaganda and education to farmers through member representatives.

After the Party and government at various levels further strengthened their leadership over grain procurement and combined it with political work, farmers' reluctance to sell grain and wait for higher prices and their concerns have changed somewhat. In many areas, autumn grain procurement work has achieved results. In late October, the amount of autumn grain procured in Shandong and Hubei showed an increasing trend. In the first half of October, the amount of coarse grains procured in North China provinces increased by 25.91% compared with the second half of September. The amount of various coarse grains procured in Henan Province increased by 75.3% in late October compared with the first ten days of the month. Soybeans are in the peak season for market sales, and the national soybean procurement situation is good. The procurement volume in the first twenty days of October increased by 382.02% compared with the last twenty days of September. Among them, Henan, one of the major producing areas, increased by 657.48%, Anhui increased by 346.38%, and Shandong increased by 171.49%. At present, the amount of soybeans on the market is gradually expanding.

    收购工作和政治工作结合进行
    各地加强领导购粮工作
   【新华社八日讯】十月份以来，全国各地中共党委和政府财经部门进一步加强了对粮食收购工作的领导，同时，各地已开始把收购工作和对农民的宣传教育工作结合进行。
    在这个期间内，粮食上市最多的是稻谷和各种杂粮，这些秋季作物占我国粮食总产量的比重很大。在相当大的地区，高粱、玉米、谷子等还是农民的主要食粮，或者是供人民调剂的食粮。当各种秋粮大量上市时，除国营贸易和合作社部门适应农民“为买而卖”的特点继续做好物资供应工作外，中共各地方党委和政府财经部门都加强了对粮食收购工作的领导。中共中央山东分局召开了粮食会议，会后山东各级党委已把粮食收购工作精神普遍向基层购粮站作了传达。中共湖北省委指示所属各级党委把购粮列为十月份的中心工作，省财委召开粮食会议作了具体布署。广东省人民政府粮食厅召开有专区合作社主任参加的各专区粮食局长和粮食公司经理联席会议，决定进一步开展秋粮收购工作。浙江温州、宁波、金华等专区中共党委通过各种会议向购粮工作干部讲明了购粮对国计民生的重大意义。中共山西阳高县委则召开区委书记联席会议布置了此项工作。经过各地党委的动员和布置，财经部门也加强了收购的组织工作。四川、湖南全省和江苏、江西一部分地区的人民政府成立了“粮食收购委员会”或“秋粮收购办公室”等联合收购组织。湖南、江苏、陕西等地农村合作社增加收购站，消除了购粮空白区。湖北黄冈、孝感专区在农村已增设了四百多个购粮站。同时，中共各地党委和政府部门对粮食收购工作的检查也加强了。江西省抚州、上饶地区专署和党委从直属机关抽出大批干部，组成十四个检查组，分别由中共地委书记和专员带领到各县检查购粮工作。
    把政治工作和收购工作结合进行，是完成购粮任务的关键。山西省太谷、芮城、阳高，江西兴国，山东文登等县的党和粮食收购部门利用召开群众大会、座谈会、黑板报、广播筒等方式，向农民讲解了出售粮食，扩大生产投资和国家大力收购粮食稳定物价，支援工业建设等兴国利民的好处，江西省黎川县各区都成立了购粮工作队，在各区、乡人民政府领导下深入宣传，使这些道理家喻户晓。湖南省衡南县人民政府召开各界人民代表会议，各代表讨论了购粮工作，并把这一工作向全县农民作了传达。中共绍兴县委召开了宣传员会议，通过农村宣传员展开了广泛的宣传活动。河南省主要棉产区灵宝的和安阳专区的合作社召开的社员代表会议，通过社员代表向农民进行了宣传教育。
    在各地党和政府进一步加强对粮食收购工作的领导并结合进行了政治工作后，农民惜售待价思想和顾虑有所改变，不少地区秋粮收购工作已获成绩。十月下旬，山东、湖北秋粮收购量呈现增加趋势。华北各省十月上半月杂粮收购量较九月下半月增加百分之二十五点九一。河南省各种杂粮收购量十月下旬比上旬增加了百分之七十五点三。大豆正值上市旺季，全国收购大豆情况良好，十月前二十天收购量较九月后二十天增加百分之三百八十二点零二，其中几个主要产区河南增加百分之六百五十七点四八，安徽增加百分之三百四十六点三八，山东增加百分之一百七十一点四九。目前，大豆上市量正逐渐扩大。
