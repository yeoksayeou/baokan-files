Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 24th. The heating furnace of the newly built large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was ignited for baking at 9:00 a.m. on November 23rd. The tall chimney emitted smoke. People looked up at this wisp of green smoke, evoking infinite memories. Just over a year ago, this was a desolate wasteland, and now a red, giant factory has been built. Soon, large quantities of large steel products and rails will be rolled out from here to support economic construction throughout the country.

The day before the ignition and baking, the workers of the heating furnace, under the guidance of Soviet experts, held the final baking meeting, deciding on the steps, methods, and further implementation of operating procedures and safety measures. On the day of ignition and baking, the day that people had been looking forward to for more than a year finally arrived. The heating workers of the large rolling mill were particularly excited. They quickly piled up a large pile of firewood at the bottom of the tall chimney; on the winding chimney flue, which was more than one hundred meters long, piles of oak wood were also prepared. At about 9:00 a.m., the director of the large rolling mill and the leader of the Soviet expert team who helped the large rolling mill start operations arrived. When the director lit the oilcloth under the pile of firewood at the bottom of the chimney, the firewood immediately burned fiercely. The raging flames reddened the smiles of the workers, and everyone couldn't help but applaud. Baking started from the chimney, then the flue, and then the heating furnace. When the temperature inside the furnace cavity of the heating furnace rises to 300 degrees, then more than two tons of steel billets can be loaded into the heating furnace for heating.

According to Xinhua News Agency: The reconstruction project of another largest automated iron-smelting furnace in our country carried out by Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been basically completed. The construction site is filled with the sound of joint test runs of various mechanical equipment all day long. Acceptance personnel are carefully inspecting the furnace body of the iron-smelting furnace and its various mechanical installation equipment. The three hot blast stoves that supply wind to this iron-smelting furnace have already ignited blue gas flames, and the workers and technicians who operate this iron-smelting furnace have also come to the construction site. Iron-smelting raw materials and various production tools are also ready.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂加热炉点火烘炉
    鞍钢又一座自动化高炉改建工程基本完工
    【新华社鞍山二十四日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建的大型轧钢厂加热炉，已在十一月二十三日上午九时开始点火烘炉。高大的烟囱冒烟了。人们仰望着这一缕缕的青烟，引起了无限的回忆。一年多以前这里还是一片荒凉的废墟，现在一座红色的巨型工厂已经建立起来。不久，大批的大型钢材和钢轨就将从这里轧制出来，源源支援全国各地的经济建设了。
    在点火烘炉的前一天下午，加热炉的工人们在苏联专家指导下，开了最后一次的烘炉会议，决定了烘炉的步骤、方法和进一步贯彻操作规程和保安措施等。点火烘炉这一天，人们盼望了一年多的日子终于来到了。大型轧钢厂加热工人特别兴奋，他们很快地在高大的烟囱底部堆起了一大堆木柴；在弯弯曲曲一百多公尺长的烟道上，也准备好了一堆一堆的柞木。上午九时许，大型轧钢厂厂长和帮助大型轧钢厂开工的苏联专家组长等来了。当厂长点燃起烟囱底部木柴堆下的油布时，顿时木柴便剧烈地燃烧起来。熊熊的火焰映红了工人们的笑容，大家都情不自禁地鼓起掌来。烘烤从烟囱开始，再烘烟道、加热炉。等加热炉炉腔内的温度上升到三百度，那时就可以把两吨多重的钢胚装进加热炉加热了。
    据新华社讯：鞍山钢铁公司进行的我国又一座最大的自动化炼铁炉的改建工程已经基本完工。工地上整天都在响着各种机械设备联合试车的声音。验收人员在仔细地验收着炼铁炉炉体和它的各种机械安装设备。供给这座炼铁炉用风的三座热风炉里，已经燃起了蔚蓝色的瓦斯火焰，操纵这座炼铁炉生产的工人和技术人员们，也来到了工地。炼铁原料和各种生产工具也都准备就绪了。
