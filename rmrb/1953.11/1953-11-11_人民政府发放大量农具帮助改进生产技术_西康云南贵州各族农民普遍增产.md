The farmers of various ethnic groups in the minority areas of Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, with the strong support of the People's Government, have improved their agricultural production techniques, and autumn crops have generally increased grain production.

    In order to develop agricultural production in the minority areas of Xikang Province and gradually change the backward phenomenon of "slash-and-burn" cultivation, the Southwest Administrative Committee allocated 16 billion yuan this year to distribute farm tools free of charge in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, and the Jinmining and Muli Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xichang Prefecture. As of the end of August, the province had distributed 115,251 farm tools, including 92,887 in the Tibetan Autonomous Region and 22,364 in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region. Distribution continued in September and October.

    The distribution of these farm tools has played a significant role in promoting agricultural production in minority areas. After receiving the farm tools, the people of all ethnic groups expanded their cultivated land area. This year, the Tibetan Autonomous Region has basically eliminated the phenomenon of land being left barren due to a lack of farm tools. Tibetan farmers have also reclaimed a large amount of wasteland. In the spring of this year alone, according to statistics from twelve counties including Kangding, Ganzi, Baiyu, and Yidun, approximately 6,800 mu of wasteland was reclaimed. In Ganzi County, twenty-six nomadic households who had never engaged in agricultural production settled down voluntarily with the help of the People's Government, organized a new village, and reclaimed more than 70 mu of wasteland. Due to the distribution of iron farm tools, cultivation techniques have also improved considerably. The people of all ethnic groups have used the newly distributed farm tools to build or repair canals, ponds, or weirs, increasing the irrigated area; they have also generally weeded more, cultivated the land, applied more fertilizer, and begun to pay attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation. Yi farmers in Yuehuojue Village, Zhaojue County, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, generally weeded an extra time this year; Yi farmers in Lanjiaba, Xide County, repaired three weirs, turning more than 80 mu of dry land into paddy fields and transplanting seedlings in a timely manner. Due to the expansion of cultivated land area and the improvement of cultivation techniques by farmers of all ethnic groups, grain production has increased. This autumn, the average yield per unit area in the Tibetan Autonomous Region increased by 15% compared with last year, and it is estimated that grain production can be increased by more than 18 million jin. Combined with the grain produced from the more than 24,000 mu of wasteland reclaimed last autumn and this spring, the total increase in production will be approximately 20 million jin. This year's bumper harvest has further encouraged the production enthusiasm of Tibetan farmers. Currently, Tibetan farmers in various counties are actively selecting seeds, accumulating fertilizer, and plowing the land in preparation for autumn cultivation, striving for a greater bumper harvest next year.

    Yunnan Province's total grain output this year increased by 3% compared with last year. Farmers of all ethnic groups in the province received various support from the Communist Party and the People's Government in their struggle against natural disasters and strive to increase grain production. Between July and August, a total of more than 100,000 Party, government, and military cadres went to the countryside to lead farmers in drought resistance and pest control. They worked in the fields with the farmers, boosting the farmers' confidence in fighting disasters. When pests were discovered, the People's Government used special planes to airlift a large number of insecticides from outside the province to Yunnan for days on end to help farmers control pests. By the end of September, the total agricultural loans issued by the Provincial People's Bank amounted to more than 204 billion yuan. During the disaster relief period, the production materials supplied to farmers by the Provincial Cooperative totaled 37 billion yuan, including 1.4 million newly made iron farm tools alone; the supply of major living materials totaled more than 290 billion yuan. At the same time, the Provincial Cooperative purchased agricultural and sideline products worth more than 150 billion yuan from farmers. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of farmers in the province actively participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. According to typical surveys and statistics in the province, the number of farmers participating in various mutual aid organizations reached 40% of the total number of farm households. This greatly strengthened the strength to fight natural disasters. Some areas concentrated hundreds of waterwheels to draw water for planting, while others united villages and townships to act collectively. Under the leadership of the Party branch, Qijie Township, Hexi County, based on the ten mutual aid groups in the township, absorbed individual farmers to participate. Under the slogan of "people rest, but the wheels don't," 160 people rotated day and night to draw water, enabling all 700 mu of "thunderous fields" to be planted with seedlings. Through the active efforts of the broad masses of farmers, the planting area of paddy fields in Yunnan Province this year reached 98.6%, and the cultivated land was expanded by 400,000 mu. Harvesting is now underway in most areas. Farmers of all ethnic groups cherish this year's harvest very much and are devising various methods to reduce grain loss.

    In Guiding Prefecture, a minority area in Guizhou Province that has already been harvested, various autumn crops have yielded a bumper harvest. The entire region will increase grain production by approximately 8% compared with last year, an estimated increase of more than 66 million jin of grain. The local People's Government led the farmers to overcome natural disasters, guaranteeing a bumper harvest, and timely supplied production and living materials during the autumn harvest, strongly supporting the autumn harvest.

    人民政府发放大量农具帮助改进生产技术
    西康云南贵州各族农民普遍增产
    西康、云南、贵州各省少数民族地区的各族农民，由于人民政府的大力支持，农业生产技术提高，秋季作物普遍增产了粮食。
    为了发展西康省少数民族地区农业生产，逐步改变“刀耕火种”的落后现象，今年西南行政委员会拨了一百六十亿元，在藏族自治区、凉山彝族自治区及西昌专区的金矿县和木里自治区藏族无偿发放农具。至八月底为止，全省已经发放农具一十一万五千二百五十一件，其中藏族自治区发放了九万二千八百八十七件，凉山彝族自治区发放了二万二千三百六十四件。九、十月份还陆续发放。
    这些农具的发放，对少数民族地区农业生产起了显著的推动作用。各兄弟民族人民得到农具以后，扩大了耕地面积。藏族自治区今年基本上消灭了因为缺乏农具而荒芜土地的现象，藏族农民并大量地开垦了荒地，单是今年春季，据康定、甘孜、白玉、义敦等十二个县统计，开出的荒地就约有六千八百多亩。甘孜县二十六户从来没有从事过农业生产的流浪户，今年在人民政府的帮助下，自动定居下来，组织了一个新村，开出了七十多亩荒地。由于铁质农具的发放，耕作技术也有了许多改进。各兄弟民族人民使用新发的农具，兴修或整修了水渠、水塘或水堰，增加了灌溉面积；还普遍多除草，耖翻土地，增施肥料，开始注意深耕细作。凉山彝族自治区昭觉县约火觉村彝族农民今年普遍多薅了一次草；喜德县蓝家坝彝族农民修好了三条水堰，把八十多亩旱田改变为水田，并及时栽了秧。由于各族农民扩大了耕地面积和改进了耕作技术，粮食都增产了。今年秋收，藏族自治区全区单位面积产量平均比去年增加百分之十五，估计可以增产粮食一千八百余万斤。加上去年秋天和今年春天开出的二万四千余亩荒地增产的粮食，共可增产二千万斤左右。今年丰收更加鼓舞了藏族农民的生产积极性，目前各县藏族农民正在积极选种、积肥、犁地，进行秋耕，争取明年更大的丰收。
    云南省今年粮食总产量比去年增加了百分之三。全省各族农民在和自然灾害斗争争取粮食增产中，得到共产党和人民政府的各种支援。在七八两月之间，全省下乡领导农民抗旱和治虫的党、政、军干部，累计共达十万多人。他们在田间和农民一道工作，鼓舞了农民和灾害斗争的信心。当虫害发现时，人民政府用专机从省外连日把大量杀虫药剂空运到云南，帮助农民治虫。到九月底止，省人民银行发放的农业贷款总计有二千零四十多亿元。省合作社在抗灾期间，供应农民的生产资料总值达三百七十亿元，其中仅新制的铁农具就有一百四十万件；对主要生活资料的供应，总值达到二千九百多亿元。同时，省合作社又收购了农民价值一千五百多亿元的农业和副业产品，全省广大农民在共产党和人民政府领导下积极参加互助合作组织，据全省的典型调查统计，参加各种互助组织的农民达到总农户数的百分之四十。这就大大加强了和自然灾害斗争的力量。有的地区集中百十部水车来车水栽种，有的地区一村一乡联合起来集体行动。河西县七街乡在党支部的领导下，以全乡十个互助组为基础，吸收个体农民参加，一百六十人在“人闲车不闲”的口号下日夜不停地轮流车水，使七百多亩“雷响田”全部栽上了秧。经过广大农民的积极努力，今年云南省稻田的栽种面积达到百分之九十八点六，并扩大了耕地四十万亩。现在大部地区已在收割。各民族农民十分珍视今年的收成，想出各种办法减少粮食损失。
    贵州省已经收获的少数民族地区贵定专区，秋季各种农作物都得到丰收。全区将比去年增产粮食百分之八左右，约计增产六千六百多万斤粮食。当地人民政府领导农民战胜自然灾害，保证了丰收，在秋收中又适时地供应了生产和生活资料，有力地支持了秋收。
