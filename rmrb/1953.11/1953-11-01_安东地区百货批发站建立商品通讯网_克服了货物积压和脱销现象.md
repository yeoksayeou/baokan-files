    Andong Area Department Store Wholesale Station Establishes Commodity Communication Network
    Overcoming the Phenomenon of Goods Accumulation and Out-of-Stock
    Sun Guode, a model allocation worker at the Andong Area Department Store Wholesale Station, learned from advanced Soviet experience and piloted a commodity communication network, which has been widely promoted in Andong and has achieved good results.

    Comrade Sun Guode is a member of the Communist Youth League. Under the leadership and education of the Party and the League, he actively studies the Party's policies and wholesale business. In April of this year, when he went to the Fengcheng Department Store to collect goods, he discovered through conversations with salespersons that many of the goods out of stock at the department stores were precisely the goods that were heavily stockpiled at the wholesale station. Therefore, he and Liu Tingliang, a salesperson at the Fengcheng Department Store, agreed to establish communication relations in the future to strengthen the connection between the wholesale department and grassroots stores, in order to prevent this phenomenon from continuing to occur. After Sun Guode returned to the wholesale station, he reported this situation to the leadership, who immediately supported him and instructed him to read the book "Soviet Trade Organization and Technology" to learn from advanced Soviet experience. From here, Sun Guode was further inspired and successively established communication relations with five retail units in areas such as Kuandian and Andong. After the initial establishment of the commodity communication network, it quickly took effect. For example, in the first communication from Liu Tingliang, a salesperson at the Fengcheng Department Store, to Sun Guode, he provided information on the need to allocate 50 million yuan of new commodities. Through this clue, the wholesale station quickly met the requirements of the Fengcheng Department Store. After this, the leadership paid more attention to the work of the commodity communication network, and while summarizing Sun Guode's experience in establishing the commodity communication network, they sent allocation workers to Kuandian and Andong counties to conduct promotion experiments. The results of the experiment were very successful, and grassroots stores greatly welcomed this communication method. In the experiment, in addition to promoting more than 3 billion yuan of commodities, they also learned many opinions from stores in various places on improving wholesale work.

    After the promotion experiment, the Andong Area Department Store Wholesale Station organized cadres to go to the countryside six times to delve into grassroots stores and promote this experience. Now, the commodity communication network of the Andong Area Department Store Wholesale Station has developed to 129 locations, distributed to various stores and outlets in the Andong area. Facts over the past six months have proven that the establishment of the commodity communication network has fundamentally changed the situation in which the wholesale station and grassroots units were not in contact with each other, made up for the shortcomings of planning personnel and purchasing personnel, and overcame the phenomenon of accumulation in one place and out-of-stock in another. Taking July as an example, 266 types of commodities were allocated through the commodity communication network. In one establishment of commodity communication relations, the various sales units requested goods worth 1 billion yuan. Among them were goods that the wholesale station considered "slow-moving" and goods that the various sales units thought the wholesale station was "out of stock" of. Because the two sides communicated the situation, the market was supplied in a timely manner. In the wholesale station itself, in the past, the planning department only grasped the principle plan, and the statistical reports did not have written explanations, so they did not play a guiding role in the business. Since the establishment of the commodity communication network, through letters and face-to-face conversations from various places, they have gradually grasped the market situation and have been able to check in a timely manner whether the plan, inventory, and purchases are reasonable. In the implementation of the third quarter commodity circulation plan, they comprehensively analyzed the situation in various aspects and timely revised the plan and order contracts, adding 34 billion yuan to the commodity circulation plan, so that the commodity supply more completely adapted to the needs of the market.

    The Andong Area Department Store Wholesale Station also provides the information reflected by commodity correspondents in various places to the industrial production departments. Units such as the Yingkou People's Knitting Factory and the Dalian Knitting Factory have improved product specifications and quality based on the opinions of the commercial communication network.

    The Andong Department Store Wholesale Station gradually enriches the content in the work of promoting the commercial communication network. In communication links, various methods are adopted according to local conditions. In cities, methods such as telephone, visits, and interviews are used for contact; in rural areas, in addition to writing letters, methods such as bringing samples to the countryside, holding small exhibitions, and organizing salespersons to visit the wholesale station warehouse are implemented to increase understanding of commodity conditions. Because the commodity communication network plays a role in commodity circulation, some commercial leadership organizations have strengthened the leadership of this work. For example, the Kuandian Department Store has its business department review the letters reflecting the situation from various commodity correspondents, and then, combined with the situation understood by the leadership, promptly reflects them to the wholesale station. This avoids duplication and makes it easier for the wholesale station to study the situation in various places.

### 安东地区百货批发站建立商品通讯网  克服了货物积压和脱销现象

    安东地区百货批发站建立商品通讯网
    克服了货物积压和脱销现象
    安东地区百货批发站模范调拨员孙国德同志，学习苏联先进经验，试办的商品通讯网，在安东各地普遍推广，现已获得良好效果。
    孙国德同志是个青年团员，在党和团的领导和教育下，他积极钻研党的政策和批发业务。今年四月，他到凤城百货公司汇货时，经过和营业员的交谈，发现许多百货公司脱销的商品，正是批发站大批积压的商品。于是，他就和凤城百货公司营业员刘廷良约定，以后建立通讯关系，加强批发部门和基层商店的联系，以防止这种现象继续发生。孙国德回到批发站向领导上汇报了这一情况，领导上当即给以支持，并指示他阅读“苏维埃贸易组织与技术”一书，学习苏联先进经验。从这里，孙国德更得到启发，又接连在宽甸、安东等地的五个零售单位中建立了通讯关系。商品通讯网初步建立后，很快就发生了作用。如凤城百货公司营业员刘廷良第一次给孙国德通讯中，就提供了需要调拨五千万元新商品的情况。通过这一线索，批发站很快满足了凤城百货公司的要求。此后，领导上对商品通讯网的工作更加重视起来，一面总结孙国德建立商品通讯网的经验，一面派遣调拨员到安东、宽甸两县进行推广实验。实验结果，获得很大成功，基层商店非常欢迎这种通讯方法。在实验中，除推销了三十多亿元的商品外，还了解了各地商店对改进批发工作的许多意见。
    经过推广实验后，安东地区百货批发站曾六次组织干部下乡，深入基层商店，推行这一经验。现在，安东地区百货批发站的商品通讯网已发展至一百二十九处，分布到安东地区各个商店和门市部。半年来的事实证明：商品通讯网的建立，基本上改变了批发站与基层单位不通声气的情况，弥补了计划人员和采购人员的不足，克服了此处积压、彼处脱销的现象。以七月份为例，通过商品通讯网关系拨出的商品就有二百六十六种。在一次建立商品通讯关系中，各销货单位就要了价值十亿元的货物。其中有批发站认为“滞销”的货物，也有各销货单位以为批发站“缺货”的货物，因为双方沟通了情况，都及时供应了市场。在批发站本身，过去，计划部门只掌握原则计划，统计表报没有文字说明，因而没有起到指导业务的作用。自建立商品通讯网后，通过各地来信、面谈，逐渐地掌握了市场情况，能够及时检查计划、库存、进货是否合理。在执行第三季度商品流转计划中，他们就综合分析了各方面的情况，及时修正了计划与订货合同，追加商品流转计划三百四十亿元，使得商品供应比较完满地适应了市场的需要。
    安东地区百货批发站还根据各地商品通讯员反映的情况，提供给各工业生产部门。营口市人民针织厂、大连针织厂等单位都依据商业通讯网的意见，改进了产品规格和质量。
    安东百货批发站在推行商业通讯网的工作中，逐步充实内容。在通讯联系上，因地制宜地采用了各种方法。在城市中，采用电话、参观、访问等方法联系；在农村中，除写信外，还实行了带样品下乡、举行小型展览，组织营业员参观批发站仓库等办法，增进对商品情况的了解。由于商品通讯网在商品流转中发挥了作用，有些商业领导机构更加强了这一工作的领导。如宽甸百货公司将各商品通讯员反映情况的信件，统由业务股看过，然后结合领导上了解的情况，及时反映给批发站。这样，避免了重复现象，更便于批发站研究各地情况。
