Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 29th: This correspondent reports: When the representatives of both sides resume the plenary session on Monday, the Korean-Chinese representatives will propose a suggestion to convene the political conference as soon as possible. The Korean-Chinese side has proposed suspending the meeting of the subcommittee discussing members, location, and time because the US side's delay has resulted in no progress for twelve days.

Since the current talks began on October 26, the Korean-Chinese side has made repeated efforts to reach an agreement, and now has taken this latest step. On November 14, a compromise proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese side enabled the common agenda, which had been delayed by the US side for twenty days, to be established. After the substantive discussions began, the Korean-Chinese representatives put forward constructive suggestions to convene the political conference in Panmunjom on December 26.

Regarding the issue of members, they suggested: First, the political conference could take the form of a bilateral, equal conference. Second, all decisions of the political conference must be reached by unanimous agreement of both sides. Third, five neutral countries—the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma—should participate. To answer Dean's feigned incomprehension, the Korean-Chinese representatives made repeated clarifications at subsequent meetings.

Regarding the explanation of "both sides," the Korean-Chinese representatives clearly told Dean that the US side was the sixteen countries participating in the Korean War and South Korea, and our side was the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China.

The Korean-Chinese side explained that the role of neutral countries is to offer opinions, mediate, and promote agreement between the two sides. The participation of neutral countries can prevent the political conference from repeating the protracted stalemate of the Panmunjom armistice negotiations and exert a restraining influence on the delaying and sabotaging tactics used by the United States in delaying the armistice negotiations. The agenda of the political conference should be decided by both sides in the current talks, and the neutral countries participating in the political conference should be free to express their opinions on all issues on the agenda.

Regarding voting rights, the Korean-Chinese representatives told Dean that any decision must be reached by unanimous agreement of both sides, and each participating country on both sides still needs to vote to express its own opinion. This would prevent any one country from depriving other countries on its own side of their voting rights.

In stark contrast to this constructive effort and negotiating attitude of the Korean-Chinese representatives, US representative Dean deliberately dragged out the ten days of substantive discussion, while issuing deceptive reports to the public that there was "progress."

Dean deliberately raised thirty-four questions (one of which included twelve sub-questions), eleven "understandings," and a host of "assumptions" to waste time in response to the Korean-Chinese proposals. All of this was clearly intended to confuse and distort the clear Korean-Chinese proposals. On the other hand, Dean refused to answer this most fundamental question—whether the United States accepts the principle that neutral countries should participate in the political conference as members and participate in its various stages of activity? Dean still avoided answering this question after proposing so-called "non-voting observers" last Saturday. This proposal is equivalent to rejecting the participation of neutral countries in the political conference.

Dean made lengthy slanderous propaganda every day against the Soviet Union and its undeniable neutrality in the Korean War, attempting to make the fundamental issue of neutral country participation in the conference impossible to discuss. An example of his ridiculous argument is: there is "neutral blue. But there is no such thing as neutral red."

Dean obstructed the progress of the discussion by reading lengthy, circuitous, pre-prepared statements full of irrelevant matters every day. These irrelevant words took up most of the time of the meeting, including such instances as: "President Roosevelt's birthplace in Oyster Bay, Sycamore, Long Island, is not far from my hometown." He then expressed dissatisfaction with the outdoor toilets and other facilities in Panmunjom, and described any residence in Munsan, saying: "Representatives can often go there to watch the tides rise and fall. In fact, in rainy weather, they don't have to go too far, because the overflowing river will impolitely come to see them in the representatives' tents." To request a recess for Thanksgiving, Dean narrated a lengthy, feignedly pious story about its origins, starting from "about three hundred and thirty-three years ago." Even a United Press reporter said: "Dean's downright ludicrous criticisms of the Panmunjom talks are nothing more than a delaying tactic."

Dean casually mentioned a total of more than a dozen cities, including Franco's Madrid, as locations for the political conference, and then told others about his "generosity." In order to deceive public opinion and achieve purely propaganda purposes, he first proposed December 1st, and then December 15th as the date for convening the political conference. This trick was immediately exposed when the US representative disagreed on setting a date for convening the political conference this year and insisted on postponing the date to the indefinite future.

The plenary session resuming on November 30 will provide a serious test to see if Dean will end his delaying tactics and abandon his tricks to prevent the political conference from being convened, in order to realize the unilateral "release" and forced retention of non-directly repatriated prisoners of war next year.

### 关于政治会议问题双方会谈的全体会议定今天恢复  美方有无诚意召开政治会议将受到严重考验

    关于政治会议问题双方会谈的全体会议定今天恢复
    美方有无诚意召开政治会议将受到严重考验
    【新华社开城二十九日电】本社特派记者报道：当双方代表在星期一恢复全体会议的时候，朝中代表将提出一项建议，以便早日召开政治会议。朝中方面已提议中止举行讨论成员、地点和时间的小组委员会的会议，因为美方的拖延已使得十二天来未获得任何进展。
    从十月二十六日开始目前的会谈以来，朝中方面为了达成协议，曾经作了一再的努力，现在又采取了这一最近的步骤。在十一月十四日，朝中方面提出的一项折衷建议使得被美方拖延二十天之久的共同的议程得以成立。在实质的讨论开始后，朝中代表即提出建设性的建议，以便在十二月二十六日在板门店召开政治会议。
    关于成员问题，他们建议：第一，政治会议可采取双方对等会议的形式。第二，政治会议的一切决定必须取得双方的一致同意。第三，应有五个中立国家——苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸——参加。朝中代表为了答复迪安假装不了解之处，又在以后的会议上作了反复的阐明。
    关于“双方”的解释，朝中代表明白地告诉迪安说，美方是参加朝鲜战争的十六个国家和南朝鲜，我方是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国。
    朝中方面解释说，中立国的作用是提出意见，进行斡旋和推动双方达成协议。中立国的参加，能够防止政治会议重蹈板门店停战谈判长期拖延的复辙，并对于美国在拖延停战谈判中所用的拖延和破坏伎俩施以抑止的影响。政治会议的议程应由双方在目前的会谈中决定，参加政治会议的中立国应能够自由地对议程上的一切问题表示它们的意见。
    关于表决权，朝中代表告诉迪安说，任何决定必须取得双方一致同意，而双方的每一个参加国家仍需自己投票，以表示它自己的意见。这样就可防止任何一个国家剥夺它自己方面其他国家的表决权。
    和朝中代表这种建设性的努力和谈判的态度截然相反，美国代表迪安一方面故意在这十天的实质讨论中进行拖延，同时向公众发布“有进展”的欺骗报道。
    迪安故意对朝中方面的建议提出了三十四个问题（其中有一个问题还包括十二个小问题），十一项“谅解”和一大堆“假设”来消磨时间。所有这些都显然是为了想混淆和歪曲明确的朝中建议。另一方面，迪安拒绝答复这一最根本的问题——美国是否接受中立国应以成员身份参加政治会议并参加它各个阶段的活动这一原则？迪安在上星期六提出所谓“没有投票权的观察员”的建议后，还是避免回答这一问题，这个建议就等于拒绝中立国参加政治会议。
      迪安每天对苏联和它在朝鲜战争中不容置疑的中立性进行长篇大论的诽谤宣传，企图借此使中立国参加会议的根本问题无法讨论。他的滑稽论点的一个例子是：有“中立的蓝色。可是决没有中立的红色这回事”。
     迪安用每天宣读冗长的、绕圈子的、事先准备好了的、充满毫不相干的事情的声明来阻挠讨论的进行。这些毫不相干的话占去了会议的大部分时间，其中有这种实例：“罗斯福总统在长岛奥伊斯特湾西卡摩尔的故乡和我的家乡相隔不远。”他随后又表示对板门店的露天厕所和其他设备的不满，并且描述汶山的任何的住所说：“代表们可以经常到那里去观看海潮的涨退。事实上，在雨天的时候，他们不必走得太远，因为泛滥的河水会不客气地跑到代表们的帐篷里来看他们。”为了要求在感恩节休会，迪安便叙述了一篇冗长的假装虔诚的关于它的起源的故事，从“大约三百三十三年前开始”讲起。甚至合众社记者也说：“迪安之所以开始提出他对板门店会谈的简直是滑稽的批评，不过是为了拖延时间罢了”。
    迪安随便说出一共有一打以上的城市，包括佛朗哥的马德里，作为政治会议的地点，然后来向别人说他的“宽宏大量”。为了欺骗舆论，达到纯粹是宣传上的目的，他先提议十二月一日，随后又提议十二月十五日为召开政治会议的日期。当美国代表不同意确定在今年召开政治会议的日期，并坚持把日期推延到无限期的将来的时候，这个把戏马上就被拆穿了。
    十一月三十日恢复的全体会议，将提供严重的考验，看看迪安是否将终止他的拖延伎俩，和放弃他那使得政治会议不得召开、以便在明年实现片面“释放”和强迫扣留不直接遣返战俘的阴谋的诡计。
