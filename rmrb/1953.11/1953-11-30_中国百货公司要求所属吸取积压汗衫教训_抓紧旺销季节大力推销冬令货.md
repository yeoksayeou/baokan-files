The national state-owned department store system currently has a large backlog of shirts and vests. According to statistics at the end of September, the inventory reached 1,258,181 dozen. Among them, the shirts and vests in stock at twelve provincial and municipal companies affiliated to the China Department Store, including Fujian and Shenyang, reached 829,900 dozen, occupying 130 billion yuan of capital. This situation is serious. Leaders at all levels of the China Department Store should learn from the serious backlog of shirts and vests, seize the peak sales season, vigorously promote winter goods, and overcome blindness in the operation of seasonal commodities. The serious backlog of shirts and vests in the national state-owned department store system is mainly due to the untimely organization of goods. Often, when the peak sales season is about to pass, seasonal goods are still blindly purchased in large quantities. There is a lack of investigation and research on the quantity of goods purchased, and it is divorced from the market and the actual needs of the people, resulting in purchases far exceeding this year's actual sales volume, causing a serious backlog. This serious backlog phenomenon is most prominent in the state-owned department store system in the Northeast region. At the end of last year, the Northeast had an inventory of 630,000 dozen shirts and vests, and this year it purchased another 560,000 dozen. This year, 530,000 dozen were sold, so the current inventory has increased to 660,000 dozen. In addition, the quality and specifications not fully meeting the needs of the people is also a factor contributing to the backlog.

The long-term serious mistakes in the operation of seasonal commodities in the China Department Store system are due to the fact that leaders at all levels of the China Department Store do not pay attention to summarizing the operating experience and lessons of seasonal commodities. Therefore, the problems existing in the operation of seasonal commodities are repeated every year. The serious backlog of shirts and vests, which wastes a large amount of state funds, is one example. To this end, China Department Store requires all its subordinate companies to learn from the serious backlog of shirts and vests. In the operation of seasonal winter goods this year, it must be noted that the peak season has arrived, and efforts should be made to vigorously promote sales during the peak sales season, striving to sell most of the goods during the peak season. If some units have a shortage of certain commodities, internal adjustments can be made appropriately. If the units still feel insufficient after the adjustments, they can only sell what they have and cannot blindly process more, and cannot repeat the mistake of stockpiling shirts and vests this year.

    中国百货公司要求所属吸取积压汗衫教训
    抓紧旺销季节大力推销冬令货
    全国国营百货系统目前积压了大量汗衫、背心，根据九月底统计，库存量达一百二十五万八千一百八十一打，其中仅中国百货公司所属福建、沈阳等十二个省市公司，库存的汗衫、背心即达八十二万九千九百余打，占用资金一千三百亿元。这一情况是严重的。中国百货公司各级领导应从汗衫、背心严重积压的事件中吸取经验教训，抓住旺销季节，大力推销冬令货，克服对季节性商品经营上的盲目性。全国国营百货系统造成汗衫、背心的严重积压，主要是由于组织货源不及时，往往在旺销季节将过时，还在盲目的大量购进季节性商品。对进货的数量，缺乏调查研究，脱离市场和人民的实际需要，使进货远超过今年实际的销售量，造成严重积压。这种严重的积压现象以东北区国营百货系统为最突出，东北去年年底库存汗衫背心六十三万打，今年又进了五十六万打，今年销出五十三万打，因而现在库存量增加到六十六万打。此外，在质量，规格上不完全适合人民的需要，也是造成积压的因素。
    中国百货公司系统对季节性商品经营上长期存在的严重错误，是由于中国百货公司的各级领导思想上不重视总结季节性商品的经营经验和教训，因此，在季节性商品经营上存在的问题，还是年年重犯，汗衫、背心的严重积压，浪费国家大量资金就是一例。为此，中国百货公司要求所属各级公司必须从汗衫、背心的严重积压事件中吸取教训，在今年冬令季节性商品的经营上，必须注意到目前旺季已到，应抓紧旺销季节大力推销，争取在旺季内大部卖完。如某些单位某些商品不足，可适当地进行内部调剂，如调剂后仍感不足的单位，也只有卖光为止，决不能再盲目加工，不能再重复今年积压汗衫、背心的错误。
