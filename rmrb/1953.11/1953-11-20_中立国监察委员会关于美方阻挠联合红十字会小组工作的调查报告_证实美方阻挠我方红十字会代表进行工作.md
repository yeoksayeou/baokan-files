Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission released a public statement regarding the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's investigation report on the US obstruction of the Joint Red Cross team's work and its review:

    On August 25th, based on the request of the Korean-Chinese side, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission dispatched the First, Second, and Third Mobile Inspection Teams to the US prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island, Yeongdeungpo, and the Imjin River Bridge, respectively, to investigate a series of incidents in which the US violated the Armistice Agreement and obstructed the work of the Joint Red Cross teams. The Military Armistice Commission has received the investigation reports of the aforementioned three Neutral Nations Mobile Inspection Teams submitted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Commission's related review, which further confirms the fact that the US violated the Armistice Agreement and the "Joint Red Cross Team Working Agreement."

    According to Article 57 of the Armistice Agreement, the US should provide Red Cross representatives with full assistance and convenience in the performance of their duties. However, the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities, on the contrary, issued the so-called "Standard Operating Procedure" on August 6, 1953, unreasonably restricting and obstructing the work of the Red Cross representatives. In the Imjin River Bridge prisoner-of-war camp, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross were only allowed to meet with one prisoner representative designated by the US prisoner-of-war camp commander each day during a six-day period. In the Yeongdeungpo prisoner-of-war camp, the US authorities even prohibited the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives from mentioning the phrases "the war is over, we are starting construction" in their greetings, illegally prohibiting them from giving greetings. The US also frequently restricted the time the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives could visit the prisoners, eventually shortening it to one hour per day in the Yeongdeungpo prisoner-of-war camp.

    According to Article 57 of the Armistice Agreement and Article 2 of the "Joint Red Cross Team Working Agreement," Red Cross representatives should be allowed to inspect all facilities related to the welfare of prisoners of war and distribute gifts. However, the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities on Geoje Island did not allow Red Cross representatives to visit and inspect the facilities of the prisoner-of-war camp while the prisoners were in the camp. The US prisoner-of-war camp authorities also used various excuses to obstruct the distribution of gifts, and in Geoje Island, they even used the prisoners' singing and clapping as an excuse to prevent the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives from distributing gifts. According to Article 57, Section 1 of the Armistice Agreement and Article 13 of the "Joint Red Cross Team Working Agreement," the US should provide the Red Cross representatives with communication facilities and should send Korean and Chinese telegrams on their behalf. However, the US violated the agreement and refused to send Korean and Chinese telegrams on their behalf, and the US prisoner-of-war camp commander at the Imjin River Bridge even refused to send the telegrams of the Chinese Red Cross representative.

    The US deliberately sabotaged the work of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross personnel by various excuses and illegal means, and even used violence against them. US military personnel at the Imjin River Bridge and Geoje Island used rifles to attack Mr. Pan Fang, Mr. Jin Shigang, and Mr. Wu Qun, obstructing them from performing their duties. The US prisoner-of-war camp authorities on Geoje Island also infringed upon the representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross when they persecuted the prisoners with poison gas.

    Regarding the above-mentioned series of US violations of the Armistice Agreement and the "Joint Red Cross Team Working Agreement," the Korean-Chinese side had repeatedly lodged serious protests with the US side in the Military Armistice Commission and the Prisoner of War Repatriation Commission at that time. However, the US side denied it outright and continued to engage in acts that violated the agreement. Now, the investigation results of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team and the world's review of these investigation reports have further confirmed the undeniable facts of these US violations of the agreement.

    As pointed out in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's review of these investigation reports, one of the reasons why the US imposed various obstructions and sabotaged the work of the Joint Red Cross Team is because the US was deeply afraid that after the prisoners of war came into contact with the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives, it would further expose the US's violation of the Armistice Agreement and the Geneva Convention in abusing and persecuting Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and forcibly preventing them from demanding repatriation, which is an unspeakable truth. But this cowardly attempt by the US is completely futile. The US's criminal acts of persecuting and abusing prisoners of war and forcibly detaining prisoners of war are already well-known facts to the world and have been further confirmed by the investigation of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team, and the US cannot escape the serious responsibility of undermining the Armistice Agreement and the "Joint Red Cross Team Working Agreement."

    中立国监察委员会关于美方阻挠联合红十字会小组工作的调查报告
    证实美方阻挠我方红十字会代表进行工作
    【新华社开城十九日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团就中立国监察委员会调查美方阻挠联合红十字会小组工作的报告与审定发表公报如下：
    八月二十五日，中立国监察委员会基于朝中方面的要求，派出了第一、二、三机动视察小组，分赴巨济岛、永登浦与临津江桥各美方战俘营，就美方违反停战协定、阻挠联合红十字会小组工作的一连串事件进行调查。军事停战委员会已收到中立国监察委员会提交的上述三中立国机动视察小组的调查报告与该委员会有关的审定，它们进一步证实了美方违反停战协定和“联合红十字会小组工作协议”的事实。
    根据停战协定第五十七款规定，美方应给予红十字会代表在其执行职司时以充分的协助与便利，但美方俘管当局相反地却在一九五三年八月六日颁布所谓“标准工作程序”，无理限制与阻挠红十字会代表的工作。在临津江桥战俘营中，朝、中红十字会的代表在六天的期间内每天只能和一个由美方战俘营长官指定的战俘代表见面。在永登浦战俘营，美方当局竟然禁止朝、中红十字会代表在慰问词中提及“战争已经结束，我们开始建设了”的词句，非法地禁止他们致慰问词。美方还经常限制朝、中红十字会代表访问战俘的时间，在永登浦战俘营最后竟缩短到每天一小时。
    根据停战协定第五十七款及“联合红十字会小组工作协议”第二款的规定，红十字会代表应得视察有关战俘福利的各项设备及分发馈赠品。但是巨济岛美方俘管当局却不准许红十字会代表当战俘在战俘营时访问与视察战俘营的设备。美方俘管当局更以种种藉口阻挠馈赠品的分发，在巨济岛甚至以战俘唱歌及拍手为藉口，阻止朝、中红十字会代表分发馈赠品。根据停战协定第五十七款寅项及“联合红十字会小组工作协议”第十三款，美方应向红十字会代表提供通讯的便利，并应代发朝文及中文的电报，但美方却违反协议，拒绝代发朝、中文的电报，而临津江桥美方战俘营长官竟然拒绝代发中国红十字会代表的电报。
    美方蓄意以种种藉口和非法手段破坏朝、中红十字会人员的工作，甚至于向他们使用暴力。在临津江桥和巨济岛的美方军事人员，以步枪冲击潘芳先生、金世刚先生和吴群先生，阻挠他们执行职务。巨济岛美方战俘营当局在以毒气迫害战俘时，更侵害了朝、中红十字会的代表。
    对于美方上述一系列违反停战协定与“联合红十字会小组工作协议”的行为，朝中方面在当时就曾在军事停战委员会和战俘遣返委员会多次向美方提出严重抗议，但美方一面矢口抵赖，一面竟继续进行违反协议的行为。现在中立国视察小组的调查结果以及全世界对这些调查报告的审定，已进一步证实了美方这些违反协议的无可抵赖的事实。
    正如中立国监察委员会对这些调查报告的审定中所指出，美方所以对联合红十字会小组工作加以种种的阻挠与破坏的一个原因，是由于美方深恐战俘与朝、中红十字会代表接触后，将进一步暴露美方违反停战协定和日内瓦公约虐杀迫害朝中被俘人员、并强力阻止他们要求遣返的不可告人的事实真相。但美方这种卑怯的企图，完全是徒劳的。美方迫害虐杀战俘和强迫扣留战俘的罪恶行为，早已是举世周知的事实，并为中立国视察小组的调查所进一步证实，而美方决不能逃避破坏停战协定和“联合红十字会小组工作协议”的严重责任。
