Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council concluded on the 28th. (Closing news can be found on page four of today's newspaper.) At its close, the meeting adopted a general resolution calling on the people of all countries to strengthen the struggle for world peace. The general resolution stated: The declaration of the World Peace Council Budapest meeting advocating consultation has aroused profound repercussions and received the broadest support. As a result of this movement, the proposition of resolving international disputes through agreements acceptable to all is gaining greater attention and yielding results day by day.

    The cessation of military action in Korea is a victory for the cause of peace.

    The recent exchange of notes between the major powers proves that a meeting of the four powers on the German question is possible in the short term.

    The proposition of stopping military action and achieving a peaceful resolution in Indochina is developing in both France and Vietnam.

    However, forces opposing the relaxation of international tensions are still disguising their plans to continue the "Cold War" in the name of "consultation." Consultation is impossible if one party forces the other to accept a fait accompli; the desire for consultation cannot be realized if someone tries to create conditions that cause consultation to fail.

    In Asia and Europe, the situation and conflicts in certain regions particularly threaten world peace.

    In Korea, negotiations are encountering danger. Attempts to prevent neutral countries, especially India, from participating in political conferences specifically related to Asian interests will cause the negotiations to fail. The people of all countries will not allow the resumption of military action in Korea.

    The interests of European security require a speedy resolution of the German question, which is only possible through an agreement between the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and France. The main obstacle on the road to this agreement is one party's attempt to revive German militarism and draw Germany into a military alliance against the other party.

    The World Peace Council calls on the people of Europe to rise up and stop the ratification of the "European Army" treaty, and to stop the revival of German militarism in any form. This will pave the way for the four powers to reach an agreement on the German question, thereby providing a peaceful future for the German people and guaranteeing all the people of Europe protection against the resurgence of German aggression.

    France and Vietnam have been at war for seven years. This war can only be ended through direct negotiations between the belligerent parties. The World Peace Council welcomes the proposals put forward by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for this purpose and supported by the delegation of the People's Republic of China. The French delegation also agrees with this suggestion, so it can serve as the basis for resolving the Vietnam War.

    The World Peace Council has always believed that foreign intervention, foreign troop occupation, and the establishment of military bases on the territory of other countries are a threat to the independence of all peoples and to peace.

    Such a policy is being developed in the Near East, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. In Europe, this policy is particularly manifested in the conspiracy to establish the "European Defense Group" and the establishment of American atomic bases in Spain; in Asia, it is manifested in Japan's occupation by foreign countries and intensified rearmament, and the United States' attempt to establish military bases in Pakistan. This recent conspiracy to establish military bases in Pakistan creates the danger of spreading war hysteria among hundreds of millions of people in another region of the world.

    The arms race and the manufacture of more powerful weapons of mass destruction are an intolerable burden and a terrible danger to the whole world.

    The World Peace Council, in the movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal and in the resolutions of the Warsaw Congress, has drawn the attention of the world to this issue. The World Peace Council regrets that the United Nations has not yet reached an agreement on this issue, and hopes that steps will be taken to unconditionally ban atomic and bacteriological weapons and greatly reduce all armaments under effective supervision.

    Finally, the World Peace Council emphasizes that while consultation on any particular issue is necessary, the World Peace Council has always believed that a conference of the five major powers is the most effective way to ease international tensions.

    At this meeting, any issue deemed to be a cause of international tension could be discussed at the initiative of any participant, and a general agreement acceptable to all could be sought.

    The persistent refusal to recognize the People's Republic of China's rightful place in international organizations is an obstacle to convening a five-power conference.

    Such a refusal is contrary to the interests of all countries and is therefore being met with increasingly severe condemnation from world public opinion.

    The United Nations Charter gives the people of all countries a tool to build lasting peace. The people of all countries should strive to ensure that the Charter is observed. Violations of the Charter have plunged the world into great difficulties. Restoring the letter and spirit of the Charter will help the people of all countries to ensure their security and independence, and create conditions for genuine cooperation between countries to develop their economic resources, improve their welfare and culture.

    The anxieties, fears, misfortunes, and hardships of life that the Cold War and the expansion of armaments inflict on the people can only be eliminated, and will certainly be eliminated, through the actions of the people. Because the fate of peace ultimately depends on the people.

### 世界和平理事会维也纳会议通过总决议  号召各国人民加强斗争保卫和平

    世界和平理事会维也纳会议通过总决议
    号召各国人民加强斗争保卫和平
    据新华社讯：世界和平理事会维也纳会议已在二十八日闭幕。（闭幕新闻见今天本报四版）会议在闭幕时通过了关于号召各国人民加强为世界和平而斗争的总决议。总决议说：世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议通过的主张协商的宣言，引起了深刻的反响，得到了最广泛的支持。由于这个运动，通过大家都能接受的协议来解决国际争端的主张一天天受到更大的重视并产生了结果。
    朝鲜军事行动的停止，是和平事业的胜利。
    最近大国互换照会一事证明，四大国在短期内举行关于德国问题的会议是可能的。
    在印度支那停止军事行动和获致和平解决的主张，不论在法国和越南，都正在发展。
    但是反对缓和国际紧张局势的力量，还在假“协商”之名掩饰它们继续“冷战”的计划。如果一方强迫另一方接受既成事实，协商便不可能实现；如果有人竭力造成使协商失败的条件，那么协商的愿望便无法实现。
    在亚洲和欧洲，某些地区的局势和冲突特别威胁着世界和平。
    在朝鲜，谈判正遭遇到危险。有人企图不让中立国、尤其是印度参加特别涉及亚洲利益的政治会议，这就会使谈判遭到失败。各国人民不允许在朝鲜恢复军事行动。
    欧洲安全的利益要求尽速解决德国问题，而德国问题的解决只有通过美、苏、英、法四国的协议才有可能。这一协议道路上的主要障碍就是有一方企图复活德国军国主义，把德国拉入反对另一方的军事同盟。
    世界和平理事会号召欧洲各国人民起来制止“欧洲军”条约的批准，制止任何形式的德国军国主义的复活。这样就能为四大国在德国问题上达成协议开辟道路，从而为德国人民提供和平的前途，给欧洲所有人民以防止德国侵略势力再起的保障。
    法国和越南已经进行了七年的战争。只有交战双方直接进行谈判，这一战争才能结束。世界和平理事会欢迎越南民主共和国代表团为这个目的而提出的并为中华人民共和国代表团所支持的建议。法国代表团也赞成这一建议，因此它可以作为解决越南战争问题的基础。
    世界和平理事会一向认为，外国的干涉，外国军队占领，在别国领土上建立军事基地，是对于各国人民的独立和对和平的威胁。
    这样一种政策，正在近东、中东各国，在拉丁美洲，在非洲得到发展。这种政策在欧洲特别表现为正在阴谋建立“欧洲防务集团”以及在西班牙建立美国原子基地；在亚洲表现为日本被外国占领和加紧重新武装以及美国正企图在巴基斯坦建立军事基地。在巴基斯坦建立军事基地这一最近的阴谋，产生了在世界上又一个地区的数亿人中传播战争歇斯底里的危险。
    军备竞赛和制造更强有力的大规模毁灭性武器，对全世界是一个不可忍受的负担和可怕的危险。
    世界和平理事会在为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动中，在华沙大会的决议中，曾促使全世界注意这个问题。世界和平理事会对联合国现在还没有在这个问题上达成协议表示遗憾，并希望采取步骤，以便在有效监督下无条件禁止原子武器和细菌武器、大大裁减各种军备。
    最后，世界和平理事会强调指出，固然对任何特殊问题的协商都是必要的，世界和平理事会过去和现在一向认为：五大国会议乃是缓和国际紧张局势的最有效的办法。
    在这个会议上可以根据任何一个参加者的倡议讨论任何一个被认为是造成国际紧张局势的原因之一的问题；求得为大家都能接受的一般协议。
    顽固地拒绝承认中华人民共和国在各国际机构中的应有地位，是召开五大国会议的障碍。
    这样一种拒绝是违背一切国家的利益的，因而遭到世界舆论越来越严厉的斥责。
    联合国宪章给予各国人民一个可以建立持久和平的工具。各国人民应当竭力使宪章得到遵守。对宪章的违背已经使全世界陷入巨大的困难。恢复宪章的文字和精神，将有助于各国人民保证他们的安全和独立，并创造条件，使各国进行真正的合作，以发展各国的经济资源、提高各国的福利和文化。
    冷战和扩充军备加给人民的忧虑、恐惧、不幸和生活的艰难，只有通过人民的行动才可以消除而且一定会消除。因为和平的命运最后取决于人民。
