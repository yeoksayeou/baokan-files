    PLA Units Actively Carry Out Preparatory Work for Universal Suffrage
    Various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively carrying out preparatory work for universal suffrage. Directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission have already conducted grassroots elections.
    According to Article 7 of Chapter 1 of the "Electoral Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China" promulgated by the Central People's Government, which states that "The People's Armed Forces and overseas Chinese may conduct elections separately. The election methods will be stipulated separately," and with the approval of the Central Election Committee, the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission has formulated election measures for the army to elect representatives to the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses, and has issued propaganda instructions to various units regarding participation in universal suffrage. The various units will convene military representatives' conferences from the bottom up to re-elect representatives to the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses.
    In order to guide the People's Liberation Army in carrying out universal suffrage work, the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government has established an election committee, with Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, as chairman. Directly subordinate organs of the Military Commission, major military regions, the Air Force, the Navy, the Public Security Forces, various armies, various provincial military districts, various military sub-districts, and regiments or equivalent units have successively established election committees to actively carry out preparatory work for universal suffrage. Various units have also universally carried out propaganda and education work for participating in universal suffrage. Newspapers published by the political departments of various units have published documents on universal suffrage and popular explanations of key points. In some units' clubs, pictures and slogans related to universal suffrage are hung everywhere. Cadres and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army are actively welcoming universal suffrage with high political enthusiasm.
    The units directly under the People's Revolutionary Military Commission have completed the preparations for universal suffrage. In preparing for universal suffrage, the leaders of some units personally gave mobilization reports to their personnel, and cadres and soldiers seriously studied relevant instructions and documents. Now, the units directly under the Military Commission have begun grassroots elections and are preparing to elect representatives of the organs directly under the Military Commission by the end of December.

    中国人民解放军各部队积极进行普选的准备工作。中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会直属机关各单位已进行基层选举。
    根据中央人民政府颁布的“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”第一章第七条“人民武装部队和国外华侨得单独进行选举。其选举办法另订之”的规定，并经中央选举委员会的审查同意，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部制定了军队选举出席全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会代表的选举办法，并向各部队发出了关于部队参加普选的宣传指示。各部队将自下而上地召开军人代表大会复选产生出席全国人民代表大会及地方人民代表大会的代表。
    为了指导人民解放军进行普选工作，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会成立了选举委员会，由总政治部副主任萧华任主席。军委直属机关、各大军区、空军、海军、公安部队、各军、各省级军区、各分区以及团或相当于团的部队都相继成立了选举委员会，积极进行普选的准备工作。各部队还普遍进行了参加普选的宣传教育工作。各部队政治部出版的报纸都刊载了关于普选的文件和通俗的解释要点，有些部队的俱乐部内，满挂着有关普选的图片和标语。人民解放军中的干部和战士都以高涨的政治热情积极迎接普选。
    人民革命军事委员会直属机关所属各单位已完成了普选的准备工作。在准备进行普选时，有的单位的首长亲自向本单位人员作动员报告，干部和战士都认真地学习了有关指示和文件。现在，军委直属机关所属各单位已开始基层选举，并准备在十二月底选出军委直属机关的代表。（新华社）
