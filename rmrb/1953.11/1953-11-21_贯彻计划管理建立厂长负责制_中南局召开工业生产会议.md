    Implement Planned Management, Establish Factory Director Responsibility System
    Central South Bureau Holds Industrial Production Conference
    The Central South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an industrial production conference from the end of October to the beginning of November. The conference exchanged information on the production status of state-owned and locally-owned factories and mines in the entire region, as well as several typical experiences in implementing planned management. It focused on examining the progress of the increase production and practice economy campaign in factories and mines across the region, and emphasized the study of implementing planned management and establishing responsibility systems to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of state plans.
    Since the third quarter of last year, state-owned and locally-owned factories and mines in the Central South region have done a considerable amount of work in improving production management. This includes wage reforms, asset verification and capital assessment, plan discussions, promotion of advanced experiences, preliminary establishment of responsibility systems, and labor discipline education for workers. These have all prepared the ground for strengthening planned management in the future and have led to a significant increase in industrial production compared to the past. However, many state-owned factories and mines have not seriously done a good job in planned management and technical management, with many enterprises still having chaotic planned management and some prominent technical problems remaining unresolved for a long time. This has affected the comprehensive completion of production plans. In the third quarter, some factories and mines paid attention to strengthening planned management, which improved production compared to the past. The Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, for example, had outstanding achievements. It failed to complete its tasks month after month in the first half of the year, but after strengthening planned management, it over-fulfilled its plan in the third quarter and won the national railway factory labor competition rotating banner. The Xikuangshan Mining Bureau strengthened planned management on its existing foundation, not only over-fulfilling its monthly plans but also improving its production balance rate. In the third quarter, the balance rate of ore mining calculated on a ten-day basis reached 98.9 percent, and the balance rate of antimony production reached 99 percent. However, such factories and mines are currently only a minority. As for locally-owned factories and mines, they have just finished rectification work, and with the exception of a few large factories and mines, the vast majority of units have not yet begun to implement planned management.
    The conference studied the above situation and believed that under the call of the central government to increase production and practice economy, ensuring that factories and mines comprehensively and evenly complete and over-fulfill production plans is the main task of the Party in factories and mines. In order to accomplish this task, on the one hand, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to carry out labor competitions, and on the other hand, it is necessary to implement and strengthen planned management and establish and improve responsibility systems. According to the experience of some factories and mines, those that have strengthened planned management and implemented work plans have taken a step forward in comprehensively and evenly completing production plans. The conference believes that state-owned and large locally-owned factories and mines in the entire region should, in the next year or so, under different circumstances and according to actual needs, take the implementation of planned management and work plans as the most important work to improve enterprise management. On the basis of this work, if each factory or mine has special or prominent problems in production (such as safety production problems, quality, and technical problems) that must be solved, the local Party committees must also guarantee to solve them. In the course of the work, if the central government has new experiences to promote or new work arrangements for various industries or certain industrial systems, the factories and mines under the various industrial systems must make appropriate arrangements for the planned management work being carried out, and ask the local Party committees to plan to shift to ensuring the progress of other work, so as to avoid becoming a formality.
    In guiding factories and mines to establish responsibility systems, the conference focused on studying the issue of establishing the factory director responsibility system. The conference believes that the management system of new enterprises is built on the principle of production regionalization, and the factory director responsibility system is the foundation for realizing production regionalization and establishing all responsibility systems. In the past for a considerable period of time, factories and mines in the entire region were in a stage of reform, and administrative cadres in charge were mostly unfamiliar with production, and factory and mine cadres did not have time to strengthen themselves. Therefore, various transitional forms (from military representatives, supervisory committees, to Party committee system) were adopted in the management system. This was appropriate at the time. Now, most factories and mines have long ended democratic reforms and have also carried out much work in production reform. Production has gradually become regularized, and factory and mine cadres have also been strengthened and improved. It should be considered that the conditions for implementing the factory director responsibility system have been met. At the same time, the strengthening of industrial production planning and the gradual improvement of national industrial management agencies also require factories and mines to establish the factory director responsibility system as soon as possible. Therefore, it is required that Party committees at all levels must systematically and gradually guide state-owned factories and mines and locally-owned factories and mines in the entire region to carry out the work of establishing the factory director responsibility system. However, since this system is just beginning to be established in the Central South region, some problems may occur during its implementation. The Party committees must be good at earnestly solving the problems that occur, and concentrate their energy on strengthening political and ideological work to give play to the supervisory and guaranteeing role of Party organizations. At the same time, in the process of implementing the factory director responsibility system, attention should also be paid to educating cadres to continue to promote a democratic style of work, prevent and overcome undemocratic tendencies, and strictly distinguish between the one-person responsibility system built on a democratic basis in socialist enterprises and the personal arbitrary dictatorship of capitalist enterprises. The conference required that Party committees at all levels must vigorously strengthen leadership, and in each province and city select one or two key points to summarize a set of better experiences in political work in factories and mines.
    The conference made a key inspection of the current situation of the increase production and practice economy campaign being carried out in the entire region. It was found that factories and mines that seriously mobilized the masses and paid attention to improving enterprise management all formulated more realistic increase production and practice economy plans, and the completion of production plans in September and October was also better than before. However, some leading cadres of factories and mines, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, had not yet mobilized the masses to formulate increase production and practice economy plans as late as the end of October. Now there is only a little over a month left until the end of the year, and these units should catch up.
    Li Xuefeng, Second Deputy Secretary of the Central South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the conference. Based on the Party's general line during the transition period, he analyzed the interrelationships of various economic tasks in realizing the country's socialist industrialization and carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. He particularly emphasized that Party organizations at all levels should do a good job in industrial construction for the important significance of implementing the Party's general line during the transition period. Therefore, the Party's work task is first to strengthen the leadership of industry. Secondly, strengthen the leadership of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. According to the situation in Central South, in addition to the work of the provinces and cities in South China that has already been deployed, the Party committees of Wuhan City and the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi should put the leadership of industry in the primary position. Starting next year, several large factories that the state plans to build in the Central South region will be successively started. Party committees of all provinces and cities must earnestly and comprehensively lead the construction of these new factories. At present, the first thing is to allocate outstanding cadres to ensure that these important projects can proceed according to plan. When talking about the specific tasks of industrial production in the future, Comrade Li Xuefeng pointed out that the first thing is to quickly and deeply develop the current increase production and practice economy campaign to ensure the timely completion of the national production plan.
    In addition, the conference also discussed the development direction and various measures for local industry. Comrade Li Xuefeng also gave corresponding instructions on how to develop local industry, adapt to the needs of the broad masses of the people, and transform private industry. (Wang Xingnan)

    贯彻计划管理建立厂长负责制
    中南局召开工业生产会议
    中共中央中南局于十月底至十一月初召开了工业生产会议。会议交流了全区国营、地方国营厂矿的生产情况和贯彻计划管理的几个典型经验，重点检查了全区厂矿的增产节约运动进展情况，着重研究了贯彻计划管理与建立责任制，以保证完成和超额完成国家计划的问题。
    中南区国营和地方国营厂矿从去年第三季度以来，在改善生产管理方面做了不少工作。如工资改革，清理资产核定资金，讨论计划，推广先进经验，初步建立责任制，向工人进行劳动纪律教育等等。这都为今后加强计划管理准备了条件，并使工业生产比前有了显著的增长。但是有不少国营厂矿还没有认真做好计划管理工作与技术管理工作，许多企业计划管理仍很混乱，若干突出的技术问题长期得不到解决。因此影响了生产计划的全面完成。在第三季度中，有些厂矿注意加强了计划管理，使生产比过去有了提高。成绩突出的如江岸机车车辆修理工厂，今年上半年月月完不成任务，加强计划管理后第三季度便超额完成了计划，获得了全国铁路工厂劳动竞赛循环优胜红旗。锡矿山矿务局在已有的基础上加强了计划管理，不但超额完成了每月计划，而且生产均衡率也比前提高了，第三季度中采掘矿石按旬计算的均衡率达百分之九十八点九，产锑均衡率达百分之九十九。但属于这类的厂矿目前还仅是少数。至于地方国营厂矿，则还是刚刚结束整顿工作，除个别大型厂矿外，绝大多数单位计划管理还没有开始推行。
    会议研究了以上情况，认为在中央增产节约号召下，保证厂矿全面均衡地完成和超额完成生产计划，是党在厂矿中的主要任务。为了完成这一任务，一方面要发动群众开展劳动竞赛，另一方面要贯彻加强计划管理，建立与健全责任制度。根据一些厂矿的经验证明：凡是已经加强了计划管理、推行了作业计划的厂矿，对全面均衡地完成生产计划都提高了一步。会议认为全区国营和大的地方国营厂矿，在今后一年左右时间内，都要在不同情况下，根据实际需要，把贯彻计划管理、推行作业计划作为改善企业管理的最主要工作。在此工作基础上，各厂矿对生产方面如有特殊或突出的问题（如安全生产问题、质量、技术问题）必须解决时，各地党委也必须保证予以解决。在工作进行中，中央如对各产业或某些产业系统方面又有新的经验推广或新的工作布置时，各产业系统所属厂矿必须对所进行的计划管理工作作一适当安排，并请示地方党委有计划地转向保证其他工作的进行，以免流于形式。
    在指导厂矿建立责任制度方面，会议着重研究了建立厂长负责制的问题。会议认为：新企业的管理制度，是建筑在生产区域制原则之上的，而厂长负责制又是实现生产区域制和树立一切责任制的基础。过去相当长时期内，全区各厂矿都处于改革阶段，行政负责干部对生产多不熟悉，厂矿干部还来不及加强，所以在管理制度上，曾采取过各种过渡形式（由军代表、监委、到党委制）。这在当时是适宜的。现在大多数厂矿早已结束了民主改革，也进行了许多生产改革方面的工作，生产逐步走上正规，厂矿干部也有所加强与提高，应认为已具备了实行厂长负责制的条件。同时，工业生产计划性的加强，国家工业管理机构的逐步健全，也要求厂矿从速建立厂长负责制。因此，要求各级党委必须有计划地逐步指导全区国营厂矿和地方国营厂矿进行建立厂长负责制的工作。但由于这一制度在中南区还是开始建立，在实行中可能会发生一些问题。对发生的问题党委必须善于认真解决，集中精力加强政治思想工作，以发挥党组织的监督保证作用。同时，在实行厂长负责制的过程中，还要注意教育干部继续发扬民主作风，防止和克服不民主的偏向，把社会主义企业建立在民主基础上的一人专责制和资本主义企业的个人专横独裁严格区分开来。会议要求各级党委必须大力加强领导，并在各省、市选择一、二重点，总结出一套较好的厂矿政治工作经验。
    对于全区目前正在开展的增产节约运动的情况，会议作了重点的检查。发现凡是认真发动群众并注意改善企业管理的厂矿，所订增产节约计划都比较切合实际，九、十两月份生产计划完成的情况也比以前好。但有些厂矿领导干部由于对今年增产节约运动的意义认识不足，迟至十月底还没有发动群众制订增产节约计划。现距年底只有一个多月，这些单位应迎头赶上。
    中共中央中南局第二副书记李雪峰同志在会议上作了报告。他根据党在过渡时期总路线，分析实现国家的社会主义工业化及对农业、手工业和对私营工商业进行社会主义改造过程中各种经济工作的相互关系，特别强调指出，各级党组织搞好工业建设对于贯彻党在过渡时期总路线的重要意义，因此，党的工作任务首先是要加强对工业的领导。其次加强对农业、手工业和对私营工商业的领导。根据中南情况，除华南各省、市的工作已作部署外，武汉市和河南、湖北、湖南、江西四省党委都应该把对工业的领导放在首要位置。从明年起，国家计划在中南地区兴建的若干大型工厂就要陆续动工，各省市党委必须认真地把这些新厂建设工作全面地领导起来。在目前首先是调配优秀的干部，以保证这些重要工程能按计划进行。讲到今后工业生产的具体任务时，李雪峰同志指出，首先是把目前的增产节约运动迅速地和深入地开展起来，保证国家生产计划的按时完成。
    此外，会议还讨论了地方工业的发展方向与各种措施办法等问题。李雪峰同志并就如何发展地方工业，适应广大人民需要及改造私营工业等问题作了相应的指示。（王兴南）
