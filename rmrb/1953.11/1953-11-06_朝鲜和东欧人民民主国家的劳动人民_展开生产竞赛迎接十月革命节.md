    (Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th) To celebrate the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, people in various parts of North Korea are enthusiastically launching various celebratory activities.
    Since late October, organs, villages, schools, and units of the Korean People's Army in various parts of North Korea have separately held lectures and symposiums related to the October Revolution anniversary. Report meetings began in various places after November 1st. A grand commemorative report meeting will be held in Pyongyang. At the same time, photo exhibitions introducing the historical sites of the October Revolution and the achievements of Soviet construction have been held in various places since mid-October. Cinemas in various cities and mobile film projection teams in various places have begun continuously screening Soviet films such as "Lenin in October," "The Vow," "The Unforgettable Year 1919," "Rainbow," and "Conspiracy."
    In recent days, people from all walks of life in North Korea have continuously visited the graves of Soviet soldiers who sacrificed themselves in the great cause of liberating Korea to pay their respects and present wreaths. They have also written letters to the Soviet people to congratulate them on the holiday, thank them for their assistance, and express their firm determination to restore construction and peacefully unify the motherland.
    When greeting the October Revolution anniversary, the production efficiency of industrial and mining enterprises in various parts of North Korea has increased during the labor competition.

Excellent train drivers such as Choi Deok-soo and Kim Kyu-tae have successively overfulfilled their transportation plans in the competition, and workers at the locomotive bureau of the Ministry of Railways have launched a fuel-saving campaign.
