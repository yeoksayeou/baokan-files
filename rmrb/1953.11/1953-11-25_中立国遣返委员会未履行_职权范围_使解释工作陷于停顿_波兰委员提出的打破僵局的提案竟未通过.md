Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 24th: The Polish member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) put forward a proposal on November 18th to break the current deadlock in the interpretation work for prisoners of war. The interpretation work has been completely suspended since the 17th because the special agents under U.S. command refused to allow the segregation of interpreted and uninterpreted prisoners of war, in accordance with the "Detailed Rules for Interpretation and Interview Work" passed by the NNRC. The chairman of the NNRC said that these special agents claimed that segregation was an indirect way of disrupting their organization. On the first day of the interpretation work, one of the demands made by the Kuomintang special agent leader to the NNRC chairman was that all prisoners of war should be returned to their original camps after interpretation.

The NNRC did not pass the Polish proposal, because only the Czechoslovak member of the NNRC supported it. The full text of the Polish proposal, published by the NNRC on the 23rd, is as follows:

(A) In order to fulfill Article 3, Paragraph 8, Subparagraph (D) of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and in accordance with Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules for Interpretation and Interview Work" passed by the NNRC, prisoners of war who have been interpreted but have not applied for repatriation and prisoners of war who have not been interpreted should be segregated;

(B) Whereas the Korean prisoners of war in Camp No. 53 who were interpreted on November 16, 1953, were not segregated from the prisoners of war in the same camp who were not interpreted on that day;

(C) Noting the statement made by the chairman of the NNRC at the 51st meeting on November 17, 1953, which stated that the main reason for not segregating interpreted and uninterpreted prisoners of war was due to guarantees given to the so-called prisoner of war "representatives" that all camps would hear interpretations every day and that segregation would not be implemented.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission:

1.  Considers that the guarantee given to the so-called prisoner of war "representatives" regarding the non-segregation of interpreted and uninterpreted prisoners of war is a violation of the provisions of Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules for Interpretation and Interview Work."

2.  Requests that the commander of the Indian Custodial Forces, acting as the administrative agent of the Indian Custodial Forces, immediately implement the provisions of Rule 20 and, without delay, construct the necessary facilities to segregate interpreted and uninterpreted prisoners of war.

3.  Decides to notify the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters of the real reason for the failure to implement the provisions of Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules for Interpretation and Interview Work" as described in paragraph (C).

### 中立国遣返委员会未履行“职权范围”使解释工作陷于停顿  波兰委员提出的打破僵局的提案竟未通过

    中立国遣返委员会未履行“职权范围”使解释工作陷于停顿
    波兰委员提出的打破僵局的提案竟未通过
    【新华社开城二十四日电】十一月十八日，中立国遣返委员会波兰委员提出了一个打破目前对战俘解释工作上的僵局的提案。解释工作已从十七日起完全停顿，因为美方指挥下的特务拒绝按照中立国遣返委员会所通过的“解释和访问工作细则”，让已经解释和未经解释的战俘隔离看管。中立国遣返委员会主席说，这些特务声称隔离看管是打乱他们的组织的间接手法。还在解释工作的第一天，国民党特务头子向中立国遣返委员会主席提出的要求之一，就是所有战俘在经过解释后都要送回他们原来的营场。
    中立国遣返委员会没有通过波兰的提案，因为只有中立国遣返委员会的捷克斯洛伐克委员支持这个提案。中立国遣返委员会在二十三日发表的波兰提案全文如下：
    （甲）为履行“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第三条第八款丁项，根据中立国遣返委员会通过的 “解释和访问工作细则”第二十款的规定，已经听过解释而尚未申请遣返的战俘和还没有听过解释的战俘，应该予以隔离看管；
    （乙）鉴于在一九五三年十一月十六日听过解释的第五十三号营场的朝鲜战俘，并未与在那一天没有听过解释的同一营场的战俘隔离；
    （丙）注意到中立国遣返委员会主席一九五三年十一月十七日在第五十一次会议上发表的声明，按在该项声明中说：不把已经解释的战俘和未经解释的战俘隔离看管的主要原因，是由于对所谓战俘 “代表”作了保证，保证所有营场每天都要听到解释，并且不实行隔离看管。
    中立国遣返委员会：
    一、认为对所谓战俘“代表”所作的关于不把已经解释和未经解释的战俘隔离看管的保证是违反“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款的规定的。
    二、要求作为印度看管部队的行政代理人的印度看管部队司令立即将细则第二十款的规定付诸实施，并且毫不拖延地建筑必要的设备，把已经解释和未经解释的战俘隔离看管。
    三、决定将（丙）项所述“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款的规定未能付诸实施的真正原因通知朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部。
