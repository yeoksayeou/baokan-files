Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 17th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee concluded its general debate on the Disarmament Commission's report on November 13th.

    Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky delivered a lengthy speech at the November 13th meeting, summarizing the results of the general debate. Vyshinsky said that during the discussion, certain representatives of the U.S.-led Anglo-American bloc attempted to portray their attitude as one of willingness to promote disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons. However, many facts demonstrate that their intentions are entirely different. It is they who are obstructing the Disarmament Commission's discussion of disarmament and the banning of weapons of mass destruction. The United States has not only failed to make any effort toward disarmament but is doing everything possible to intensify arms expansion and prepare for a new world war.

    Vyshinsky said that the discussion of the Disarmament Commission's work in the Political Committee has revealed serious obstacles hindering the smooth progress of the Commission's work. Only by correctly understanding its tasks and embarking on the only path that can successfully resolve these tasks can the Disarmament Commission achieve results. The fourteen-nation proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, France, and others does not provide the necessary conditions for the Disarmament Commission's work to succeed. The malicious purpose of this proposal is to continue to delay the implementation of measures for disarmament and the banning of the use of weapons of mass destruction.

    Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation's proposal to the General Assembly on measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and ease international tensions stipulates specific measures for the immediate reduction of armaments and armed forces, as well as the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. If the General Assembly adopts these recommendations, it will ensure effective disarmament and the banning of atomic and hydrogen weapons, which is of great significance for maintaining peace and international security. The Soviet delegation also urged everyone to pay attention to the importance of the Soviet Union's amendments to the fourteen-nation proposal during the discussion. These amendments instruct the Disarmament Commission to submit recommendations to the Security Council by March 1, 1954, stipulating the primary reduction of armaments by the five major powers: the United States, Britain, France, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, as well as the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, while also establishing strict international control over the implementation of this ban.

    During the discussions on the 10th, 11th, and 12th meetings, representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Belarus spoke, criticizing the U.S. ruling circles for paying lip service to disarmament while actually striving to obstruct the resolution of the disarmament issue, rendering the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission impossible. This U.S. policy runs counter to the desire of peace-loving humanity to further ease international tensions and to take concrete measures to reduce armaments and ban weapons of mass destruction.

    They pointed out that the fourteen-nation proposal is unacceptable because it does not stipulate the true tasks of the Disarmament Commission, and they expressed support for the Soviet Union's amendments to the fourteen-nation proposal, which specifically stipulates the Disarmament Commission's tasks in the area of disarmament.

    Representatives from several smaller countries, in their speeches, called on the major powers to reach an agreement on disarmament in order to ease international tensions. The Egyptian representative emphasized that the delegations of small countries are extremely dissatisfied with the United Nations' lack of achievement in disarmament. He said that it is impossible to advocate arms expansion on the one hand while simultaneously claiming to desire disarmament. The Argentine representative said that the ultimate goal of all disarmament plans is not to stipulate the quantity and type of various armed forces and armaments, but to prevent another war. To achieve this goal, it is necessary for the major powers to reach an agreement. The Norwegian representative pointed out that after the signing of the Korean armistice agreement, people all over the world are looking forward to new steps to further ease tensions. Therefore, the major powers bear a significant responsibility. The Pakistani representative said that if armaments are reduced, it will ease international tensions.

    Representatives from France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, and other countries spoke in the discussion, supporting the fourteen-nation proposal. They avoided mentioning the amendments to the fourteen-nation proposal put forward by the Soviet Union.

    联大政委会结束关于裁军委员会报告的一般辩论
    维辛斯基斥责美国加紧扩张军备
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在十一月十三日结束了关于裁减军备委员会报告的一般辩论。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在十三日会议上发表了长篇演说，概括了一般辩论的结果。维辛斯基说，在这次讨论中，以美国为首的美英集团的某些代表企图把他们的态度说成是愿意促进实现裁减军备和禁止原子武器的。但是，许多事实说明他们的意图完全不是这样。正是他们阻挠裁减军备委员会讨论裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的问题。美国不但没有在裁减军备上尽过一点力气，却是尽其一切可能加紧扩张军备和准备新的世界大战。
    维辛斯基说，政委会讨论裁军委员会工作的过程中，暴露出阻碍裁军委员会顺利工作的严重障碍。裁军委员会只有正确地了解它的任务，并走上唯一可能顺利解决这些任务的道路，它的工作才会有成绩。美、英、法等十四国提案没有为裁军委员会工作获得成功提供必要的条件。这个提案的恶毒目的是，继续拖延实行裁减军备和禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器的措施。
    维辛斯基说，苏联代表团向大会提出的关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施的提案，规定了立即裁减军备和武装部队以及禁止原子武器及氢武器的具体措施。大会如果通过这些建议，就可能保证有效地裁减军备和禁止原子武器及氢武器，这对维护和平及国际安全有重大意义。苏联代表团同时也要求大家注意苏联在讨论中对十四国提案提出的一些修正案的重要性，这些修正案责成裁军委员会在一九五四年三月一日以前向安全理事会提出建议，规定首先裁减美国、英国、法国、中华人民共和国和苏联五大国的军备，以及禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，同时并对这项禁令的执行建立严格的国际监督。
    在十、十一、十二日会议的讨论过程中，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰和白俄罗斯代表发言，斥责美国统治集团空谈愿意裁军，而实际上竭力阻挠解决裁军问题，使联合国裁减军备委员会的工作无法进行。美国这种政策是与爱好和平的人类要求进一步缓和国际紧张局势、要求采取具体措施起来裁减军备及禁止大规模毁灭性武器的愿望背道而驰的。
    他们指出十四国提案是不能接受的，因为它没有规定裁军委员会的真正任务，他们表示支持苏联对十四国提案的修正案，这些修正案具体规定了裁军委员会在裁减军备方面的任务。
    若干小国的代表在发言中要求大国在裁军问题上获致协议，以缓和国际紧张局势。埃及代表强调指出，小国代表团对联合国在裁减军备方面没有成就极感不满。他说，一方面鼓吹扩张军备而同时又声称希望裁减军备，是不可能的。阿根廷代表说，一切裁军计划，其最后目标决不是规定各种武装部队和军备的数量和类型，而是要防止另一次战争。为达到这个目的，就必须大国之间获得协议。挪威代表指出，朝鲜停战协定签订之后，全世界人们都期待着进一步缓和紧张局势的新步骤。因此各大国负有重大的责任。巴基斯坦代表说，军备如果得到裁减，就将使国际紧张局势趋于缓和。
    法国、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰、土耳其等国代表在讨论中发言，支持十四国提案。他们避而不谈苏联对十四国提案提出的修正案。
