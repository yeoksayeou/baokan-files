A Transaction from the "Land of Gentlemen"
　　Su Hu

　　People often see debtors delaying and unwilling to pay on time; however, in the China National Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Company, something different happened: the creditor delayed and was unwilling to collect the money promptly.

　　In April of this year, the China Film Equipment Company purchased a batch of projectors from the Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Company, worth more than twenty billion yuan. The projectors were quickly delivered, but the Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Company was slow to collect payment. By July, the Film Equipment Company proactively urged the Finance and Accounting Section of the Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Company to come and collect payment quickly, and declared: otherwise, the Film Equipment Company would not be responsible for any interest losses caused by the delayed settlement. Despite this, the Finance and Accounting Section of the Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Company ignored this amount of more than twenty billion yuan, remaining indifferent and delaying the matter.

　　In August, the Film Equipment Company sent someone to the Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Company to discuss the matter, but still there was no follow-up. The Film Equipment Company reported this matter to the Ministry of Culture. At a meeting, comrades from the Ministry of Culture specifically mentioned this "selling goods without wanting payment" transaction, hoping that the Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Company would quickly settle and collect the payment. Li Zhonglun, the Deputy Section Chief of the Finance and Accounting Section, attended the meeting and was urged by everyone. However, he did not intensify his handling of the matter because of this; he just casually asked about it in the section and then abandoned it again. The delay continued until the Financial Accounting Bureau and the Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade sent people to inspect, at which point the Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Company finally collected the payment.

　　What was the reason for this delay? It is said that it was because the contract was originally signed with the Industrial Equipment Company, and later the account was changed to the Film Equipment Company, making it inconvenient to collect payment. If the Film Equipment Company had concealed this matter, making it impossible for the Metals and Electrical Appliances Import Company to find the object to collect from, it might have been understandable; however, the actual situation was completely different. Selling goods and not wanting money seems even more virtuous than the characters in the Land of Gentlemen in "Flowers in the Mirror." However, this kind of "virtue" brings great losses to the country. A true gentleman's transaction should involve goods of genuine quality and fair price, selling goods and collecting payment, without asking for a penny more or a penny less. If the wealth of the country is not taken seriously, and it is casually given away to show the "generosity" of an individual or department, what kind of gentleman is that! The leaders of this department should seriously deal with this matter so that all staff can receive the education they deserve.

    一笔“君子国”的交易 
    苏胡
    人们往往看见欠钱的人拖延时间，不愿及时偿付；在中国五金电工进口公司却发生这样一件事，而是收钱的人拖延时间不愿及时收款。
    今年四月，中国电影器材公司向五金电工进口公司购买了一批放映机，价值二十多亿元。放映机很快交接完了，五金电工进口公司却迟迟不去收款。等到七月，电影器材公司主动地催促五金电工进口公司财务会计科，请他们很快前来收款。并且声明：否则，由于延期结算造成的利息损失，电影器材公司概不负责。虽然如此，五金电工进口公司的财务会计科并没有去理会这笔为数二十多亿元的款项，而仍然是不闻不问，一味地进行拖延。
    八月，电影器材公司派人到五金电工进口公司面谈此事，可是，依旧是没有下文。电影器材公司把这件事报告到文化部，在一次会议上，文化部的同志特别提起这件“卖货不要钱”的交易，希望五金电工进口公司迅速结算收款。财务会计科副科长李中仑参加了这次会议，受到了大家的督促。不过，他并没有因此就加紧的处理这件事情，只是回到科里随便问了问，就又丢手不管了。拖延到最后，直至对外贸易部财务会计局和监察局派人检查时，五金电工进口公司才把这笔款项收回来。
    究竟为什么这样拖延呢？据说是因为原来是和工业器材公司签订的合同，后来户头改为电影器材公司所以不便收款了。如果是电影器材公司把这件事隐瞒起来，使得五金电工进口公司找不到要钱的对象，似乎还情有可原；但是，实际情况却又完全不是这样。卖货而不要钱，好像比“镜花缘”里君子国中的人物还要清高一些。但是，这种“清高”却给国家带来很大的损失。真正的君子交易应该是货真价实、卖货收款，不多要一个钱，也不少要一个钱。如果把国家的财富看得不算一回事，随便可以不要，来表示个人或部门的“慷慨”，这算得什么君子！这一部门的领导人，应当严肃地处理这一事情，使全体工作人员受到应有的教育。
