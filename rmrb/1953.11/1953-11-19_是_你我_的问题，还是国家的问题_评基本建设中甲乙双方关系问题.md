Is It a Matter of "You and Me" or a Matter of the State?
——Commentary on the Relationship between Party A and Party B in Capital Construction
Yue Jun

In capital construction projects, the quality of the relationship between the construction unit (Party A) and the contracting unit (Party B) has a significant impact on whether or not national tasks can be completed well. From the letters we have received from readers, there are many cases where construction projects have suffered losses due to poor relations between Party A and Party B.

For example, the new warehouse project of the Beijing Company of China Chemical Raw Materials Company (hereinafter referred to as Party A) was contracted by the Central Commercial Department Engineering Company (hereinafter referred to as Party B). Due to the inability of Party A and Party B to unite and cooperate, and even the development of unprincipled disputes, many shortcomings that could have been corrected in a timely manner through consultations during the construction process were not corrected in a timely manner. As a result, the finished project has the following problems: the warehouse capacity and height are not up to standard, the warehouse doors are narrow, making it extremely inconvenient to load and unload goods; the warehouse leaks rain, and the plaster on the ceiling is peeling off; the masonry work on the walls is rough and uneven, and there are cracks in the foundation; the ground filling in the office building is not compacted firmly, and the cement floor and the base of the wall are cracked; the ventilation equipment in the basement is poorly designed, the wall joints are rough, the grouting is insufficient, and rainwater flows into the basement from the ventilation pipes and brick seams when it rains; in particular, the basement is built above ground level, making it unusable. In short, the quality of the project is very poor.

The situation developed as follows: at the beginning of the project, Party B did not build the lower half of the basement below ground level according to the design requirements for the basement in the design condition book. The reason was that the groundwater level in the basement area was high, and it was impossible to build it underground without waterproofing equipment; however, it did not explain this to Party A and changed the design. During the construction process, Party A discovered this problem, as well as some other problems in the project, such as the doors and windows being too small, insufficient ventilation equipment, etc., and raised them with Party B. Party B did not conduct careful research, and seized on Party A's urgent need to use the warehouse, disguisedly refusing and saying: "If you modify it, you will need to suspend work for half a month." Party A did not insist on its own opinion at the time, nor did it immediately report to the higher authorities, holding the attitude of "If you don't accept it now, I will raise it after completion and let you rework." In this way, the relationship between the two parties began to have a gap, and the gap became deeper and deeper. For example, the warehouse director of Party A and the construction director of Party B, whose offices were only separated by a wall, could have consulted each other face-to-face when something happened, but they still corresponded with official documents. The two material procurement officers were temporarily assigned by Party A to lead Party B, but Party B did not fulfill its leadership responsibilities, but used the substandard wood purchased by the procurement officers as is, mistakenly believing that this was Party A's personnel, and that Party A should be responsible for the substandard materials. As for the impact on the life of the warehouse, they paid no attention to it at all. After the completion of the project, Party A refused to accept it; Party B also held the attitude of "I won't repair it, and you won't be able to use it," and refused to modify it. Later, the higher authorities decided to first remedy the shortcomings of the project so that the materials stored in the open air could be put into the warehouse as soon as possible, and then investigate the responsibility. Party A's warehouse director still acted wilfully, insisting on clarifying the right and wrong before starting work, and therefore did not allow Party B's workers to eat and live on the construction site when repairing the work. Party B's construction director also refused to start repairs unless Party A paid all the final payments. Both parties were keen on this unprincipled dispute, and disregarded the losses suffered by the state materials stored in the open air.

The main reason why the relationship between Party A and Party B above is not good is that the leading cadres specifically responsible for these projects do not consider the issue from the overall interests of the state, but talk about "yours" and "mine" away from the interests of the state, and therefore use their own "wrong" to oppose others' "wrong." Under this unprincipled dispute, the interests of the state have become their victims. The correct relationship between Party A and Party B should be to use the spirit of mutual respect, mutual consultation, and mutual assistance to reasonably solve the problems that occur in the progress of the project, and better complete the construction tasks entrusted by the state.

In this regard, there are many experiences that can be learned. For example, Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 25 and Shenyang Installation Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry established systems such as joint inspection by both parties, material pre-inspection, and regular reporting at the beginning of the project, and used a close cooperation attitude and mutual consultation methods to solve problems in the project in a timely manner, so that the project could proceed smoothly. Another example is the Datong Third Middle School school building contracted by the Datong Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau. After the project started, Party B and Party A jointly formed a construction site management committee and a quality inspection team to regularly inspect the quality and study the work in stages. Whenever important parts of the project were under construction, Party B would solicit Party A's opinions. Sometimes Party A was invited to attend the meetings held on the construction site. Party B respected Party A's opinions very much, and adopted the feasible parts in a practical way, and gave necessary explanations for those that could not be done, and jointly sought solutions for those that were difficult to implement. Party A also respected Party B's opinions and tried its best to help Party B obtain convenience in life and working conditions. In this way, Party B also worked with the attitude of "owner". Under the close cooperation between Party A and Party B, the construction period and quality have been strongly guaranteed. The above practices are worthy of learning by Party A and Party B in various construction projects.

    是“你我”的问题，还是国家的问题
    ——评基本建设中甲乙双方关系问题
  　岳　军
    在基本建设工程中，建设单位和承包单位甲乙双方关系的好坏，对能否很好完成国家任务有重大的影响。从我们收到的读者来信中看，因为甲乙双方关系不好，以致使建设工程受到损失的情况是不少的。
    例如，中国化工原料公司北京市公司（下称甲方）新建的仓库工程，是由中央商业部工程公司
  （下称乙方）承包的。由于甲乙双方不能团结合作，甚至发展到无原则的争吵，使很多在施工过程中可以用协商办法及时纠正的缺点没有得到及时纠正。因此，完工后的工程情况是：库房容量和高度不够标准，库门窄小，装货取货极不方便；库房漏雨，顶棚上的抹灰有脱落现象；墙壁圬工粗糙凹凸不平，基础部分还有裂缝；办公室工程的屋内地坪填土没有夯砸坚固，水泥地面和墙根脱裂；地下室工程的通风设备设计不良，墙壁勾缝粗糙，灌浆不足，下雨时雨水竟从通风管和砖缝流入地下室内；特别是地下室建筑在地平线以上，因而不能使用。总之，工程质量是非常低劣的。
    情况的发展是这样的：在工程开始时，乙方没有按照设计条件书上对地下室的设计要求将地下室的下半部建筑在地平线以下。理由是地下室区域地下水位较高，如果没有防水设备，不可能建立在地下；可是却没有向甲方说明，就改变了设计。施工过程中，甲方发现了这个问题，也发现了工程上的一些其它问题，如门窗太小、通风设备不够等等，曾向乙方提出。乙方未加认真研究，抓住了甲方急待使用仓库的要求，变相地拒绝说：“如果修改，需要停工半个月。”甲方当时没有坚持自己意见，也不立即向上级反映，抱着“你现在不接受，完工后再提出，让你返工”的态度。这样，双方关系开始有隔阂，而且隔阂愈来愈深。比如甲方的仓库主任和乙方的施工主任，办公室仅是一墙之隔，遇事本可当面洽商，可是彼此还以公文来往。两个材料采购员是由甲方临时调配给乙方领导的，可是乙方不尽领导责任，却把采购员买来的不合规格的木材照样用上，错误地认为这是甲方的人员，材料不合规格应由甲方自己负责。至于对仓库寿命的影响如何，一点也不注意。工程完工后，甲方不予验收；乙方也抱着“我不修，你也用不上”的态度，不予修改。后来上级机关决定首先补救工程缺点，务使露天存放的物资早日入库，然后再追查责任。甲方仓库主任仍然意气用事，坚持首先弄清是非再予开工，因而不让乙方工人修工时在工地食宿。乙方施工主任也非让甲方全部付清末期款后才肯动工修理。双方都热中于这种无原则的争执，而对露天存放着的国家物资所受到的损失都置之不顾。
    以上甲乙双方关系搞得不好的主要原因，是具体负责这些工程的领导干部，不是从国家的整体利益出发去考虑问题，而是离开了国家的利益去谈“你的”、“我的”，因而便用自己的“不对”去反对别人的“不对”。在这种无原则的纠纷下，国家利益变成了他们的牺牲品。正确的甲乙双方关系，应该是用互相尊重、互相协商、互相帮助的精神，来合理地解决工程进程中所发生的问题，更好地完成国家所交付的建设任务。
    在这一方面，有不少的经验是可以吸取的。例如沈阳机械二十五厂和第一机械工业部沈阳安装工程公司在工程开始时，建立了双方会同检查、材料预检、定期汇报等制度，用密切合作的态度、互相协商的办法，及时解决工程中的问题，因而使工程能够顺利进展。又如大同市建筑工程局承建的大同第三中学校校舍，乙方在工程一开工后，即与甲方共同组成工地管理委员会、质量检查组，定期地分段检查质量、研究工作。每当工程重要部分施工时，乙方便征求甲方意见。有时工地召开的会议，也请甲方列席。乙方很尊重甲方的意见，对于可行部分加以切实采纳，不能办到的即予必要的解释，执行有困难的则共同觅求解决办法。甲方也同样尊重乙方意见，并在生活上、工作条件上尽量帮助乙方得到便利。这样乙方也以“业主”的态度进行工作。在甲乙双方的密切合作下，工期和质量都得到了有力的保证。以上这些做法，都是值得各建设工程中的甲乙双方学习的。
