    Xinghuo Collective Farm Holds Members' Meeting
    Enthusiastically Sells Grain to Support National Construction

    [Report from this newspaper] The Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, held a members' meeting on November 9th, deciding to sell 1.62 million jin of rice to the state to support national construction.
    The Xinghuo Collective Farm was established in February 1951 on the North Manchurian grasslands, which just a few years ago were still called "Great Northern Wilderness." Due to the centralized use of land, unified allocation of labor, implementation of the principle of distribution according to work, and the introduction of mechanized farming, the production enthusiasm of the farm members is extremely high, and grain output is much higher than that of ordinary local farmers. In 1952, the Xinghuo Collective Farm averaged 11,000 jin of rice per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu), which was 4,000 to 5,000 jin more than ordinary farmers per hectare.
    This year, with the help of the state, mechanized operations at the Xinghuo Collective Farm have reached 40% of the total annual labor volume, with mechanized operations accounting for 70% of the total labor volume in spring plowing, and tractor plowing reaching 78.2% of the total cultivated area. This has played a significant role in the farm's production.
    All members of the Xinghuo Collective Farm have demonstrated a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm this year. On the basis of mechanized farming, they improved and enhanced agricultural techniques, adopting the new "dry sowing" cultivation method, which resulted in an unprecedented bumper harvest of 202 hectares of rice, with an average yield of more than 12,000 jin of rice per hectare.
    After listening to the mobilization speech by Li Zaigen, the secretary of the Xinghuo Collective Farm branch of the Chinese Communist Party and vice chairman of the farm, on patriotic grain sales, the members of the farm held a heated discussion at the members' meeting on November 9th. The members fully realized the importance of realizing national socialist industrialization from the farm's superior achievements in mechanized operations over the past few years. Therefore, everyone was willing to sell all surplus grain to the state to support national construction. At the members' meeting, farm member Li Zhenshu said: "Our farm uses tractors for farming, which has increased grain production and income. I am determined to sell all surplus grain to the state to support national industrial construction." Li Lianchun said: "We sell surplus grain to the state, and the state can quickly manufacture machines and tractors for us, allowing us to produce more grain and live a good life." Cui Mingshu, the director of the farm's women's affairs, also calculated the details of the decline in industrial product prices, saying: "Last year, bleached cloth was 4,000 yuan per chi, but this year it is 3,300 yuan per chi. The price of grain has also increased this year. In this way, one shi of second-class grain could only buy 71.5 chi of cloth last year, but this year it can buy 100 chi and 3.6 cun. This is all thanks to the development of industry."
    After a heated discussion, all members unanimously agreed with the plan of the farm management committee: of the more than 2.42 million jin of rice harvested this year, after deducting public grain and the members' rations, etc., the remaining 1,612,000 jin of rice, together with the more than 7,000 jin saved, for a total of 1.62 million jin of rice, will all be sold to the state before the end of the year.
    On November 11th, the Xinghuo Collective Farm dispatched ten large carts to deliver 18,000 jin of rice to the state-owned grain company.

### 星火集体农庄召开庄员大会  踊跃售粮支援国家建设

    星火集体农庄召开庄员大会
    踊跃售粮支援国家建设
    【本报讯】松江省桦川县星火集体农庄在十一月九日召开庄员大会，决定卖给国家一百六十二万斤稻谷，支援国家建设。
    星火集体农庄是一九五一年二月在几年前还被人叫作“北大荒”的北满草原上建立起来的。由于集中使用土地，统一调配劳动力，实行按劳分配的原则，又开始使用机械耕作，农庄庄员生产情绪极高，粮食产量比当地一般农民高出许多。一九五二年，星火集体农庄每垧（合十五市亩）水田平均产一万一千斤稻谷，比一般农户每垧水田多产四、五千斤。
    今年，星火集体农庄在国家的帮助下，机械化作业已达到全年总劳动量的百分之四十，春耕生产中机械化作业占总劳动量百分之七十，拖拉机翻地达到总耕地面积的百分之七十八点二。这对于农庄的生产起了很大的作用。
    星火集体农庄全体庄员，今年发挥了高度的爱国主义劳动热情。他们在机械耕作的基础上，改进和提高了农业技术，采用了“干播”的新耕作法，使二百零二垧水稻获得空前的丰收，每垧稻谷的产量平均达一万二千多斤。
    农庄全体庄员，在十一月九日的庄员大会上听了中共星火集体农庄支部书记、农庄副主席李在根关于爱国售粮的动员讲话以后，进行了热烈的讨论。庄员们从农庄几年来机械化作业的优越成绩，充分体会到实现国家社会主义工业化的重要性。因此，大家都愿意把余粮全部卖给国家，支援国家建设。在庄员大会上，农庄庄员李贞淑说：“我们农庄使用拖拉机耕作，多打了粮食，收入也多。我决心把余粮都卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。”李连春说：“我们把余粮卖给国家，国家就能快点给我们制造机器、拖拉机，使我们更多打粮食，过好生活。”农庄妇女主任崔明淑还把工业品价格下降的情况算了细账，她说：“去年漂白布四千元一尺，今年三千三百元一尺。粮价今年又提高了。这样一来，一石二等粮去年只能买七十一尺半布，今年就能买一百尺零三寸六分。这都是工业发展了的好处。”
    经过热烈讨论，全体庄员一致同意农庄管理委员会的计划：今年收的二百四十二万多斤稻谷，除去公粮和庄员的口粮等项外，把余下的一百六十一万二千多斤稻谷，连同节约的七千余斤，总共一百六十二万斤稻谷，在年底以前全部卖给国家。
    十一月十一日，星火集体农庄出动了十辆大车，把一万八千斤大米送到了国营粮食公司。
