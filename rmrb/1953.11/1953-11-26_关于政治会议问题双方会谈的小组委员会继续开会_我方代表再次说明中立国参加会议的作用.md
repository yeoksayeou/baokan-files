Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 24th: The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the political conference question issued the following communique:

    On November 24th, the two subcommittees of the bilateral talks on the political conference question held their seventh meeting.
    In the subcommittee discussing the first item on the agenda, our representative, Mr. Qi Shifu, once again refuted the absurd arguments of the other side and reiterated our position. He said that the agenda of the political conference should be determined by both sides in this meeting, and the neutral nations participating in the political conference should, without a doubt, be able to fully express their opinions on all issues on the agenda during the discussion process; otherwise, the participation of neutral nations in the political conference would be meaningless. As for the voting on all issues in the political conference, the principle of consensus between the two sides should be adopted. If the other side attempts to negate this principle and exploit the objective situation that the countries participating in the political conference on their side may be more numerous while the countries participating on our side are fewer, in order to suppress one side by a majority vote and impose one side's opinions on the other, this method obviously cannot solve the problem. Therefore, the role of neutral nations participating in the political conference lies not in their voting rights, but in their providing opinions to promote an agreement between the two sides. The rationality and feasibility of our proposition are very clear and beyond doubt. Mr. Qi Shifu also pointed out that in order to enable both sides to reach an agreement on the issue of members quickly, our side has put forward three reasonable suggestions and made full explanations. Whether the issue of members of the political conference, which is of concern to the world, can be reasonably resolved depends entirely on the other side.
    The U.S. representative continued to evade serious discussion of the central issue, delaying time with off-topic speeches without resolving the problem.
    In the subcommittee discussing the second item on the agenda, the U.S. representative also failed to put forward any constructive suggestions, resulting in no progress in the meeting.

    关于政治会议问题双方会谈的小组委员会继续开会
    我方代表再次说明中立国参加会议的作用
    【新华社开城二十四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月二十四日，关于政治会议问题双方会谈的两个小组委员会举行第七次会议。
    在讨论第一项议程的小组委员会中，我方代表奇石福先生再度驳斥对方的荒谬论点，并重申我方的主张。他说，政治会议的议程应由双方在此次会谈中加以确定，而参加政治会议的中立国，则毫无疑问应在讨论过程中对议程上的所有问题能够充分发表他们的意见，否则中立国参加政治会议将毫无作用。至于政治会议中一切问题的表决，应采取双方一致同意的原则。如对方企图否定这一原则，利用对方参加政治会议的国家可能较多而我方参加的国家较少这一客观情况，以多数表决的方法压制一方，把一方的意见强加在另一方的身上，这种方法显然是不能够解决问题的。因此，中立国参加政治会议的作用，不在于它们的投票权，而在于它们的提供意见推动双方取得协议。我方此种主张的合理与切实可行，是十分明白的，实无可以置疑之处。奇石福先生并指出：为了使双方在成员问题上迅速达成协议，我方已提出了三点合理建议并作了充分的说明，举世关心的政治会议的成员问题能否合理解决，全视对方。
    美方代表继续规避对中心问题的认真讨论，以离题很远的发言拖延时间而不解决问题。
    在讨论第二项议程的小组委员会中，美方代表也未提出任何建设性的意见，以致会议仍无进展。
