Daye Steel Plant with the Help of Soviet Experts
Wang Che

I

Workers, technicians, and management cadres of the Daye Steel Plant are expressing their gratitude with immense excitement for the assistance provided by Soviet experts. Whenever Factory Director Gao Yunsheng discusses the improvements in the production of special steel [Note 1] at the plant, he naturally connects it with the help of Soviet experts. Engineer Su Nengsi, when speaking about the technical assistance he received from Soviet experts, said: "It's like finding the correct compass in a voyage where you've lost your way." Pang Dejin, a production team leader in the electric furnace workshop, said: "The Soviet experts' working attitude of relying on scientific analysis and scientific experiments to make steel is a good education for my old-fashioned working methods of 'relying on eyesight' and 'depending on experience.'"

In January of this year, the Daye Steel Plant began to produce special steel in large quantities. Faced with the new production tasks, from leadership to workers, from technology to management, there was a lack of sufficient experience. Therefore, from January to June this year, the finished products that passed inspection throughout the plant only accounted for 47.254 percent of the total production plan, seriously affecting national defense construction and economic construction. In addition, the high amount of waste, high costs, lack of coordination between workshops, and the inability to formulate production plans based on orders were even more common phenomena.

In June, Soviet expert Comrade Zhuyev and Czech Comrade Galarov came, bringing a new look to the Daye Steel Plant. In just over a month, the two experts gave more than 20 reports on technical and management issues, put forward 24 major and 161 general suggestions, and personally conducted demonstration operations in the electric furnace, forging, and heat treatment workshops that produce special steel. They solved long-standing problems in production technology, technical management, and production management at the Daye Steel Plant, bringing about fundamental changes in the plant's production.

At that time, the weakest links in the Daye Steel Plant were the forging workshop and the heat treatment workshop. The steel ingots produced by the electric furnace workshop often could not be forged due to the small production capacity of the forging workshop; the steel materials produced by the forging workshop and the rolling mill workshop could not be delivered in time due to the long annealing time in the heat treatment workshop. There was a serious imbalance in production.

Soviet expert Comrade Galarov studied this situation in detail and proposed the "high-temperature charging, rapid heating, and assembly line operation method" in the forging workshop. This changed the backward method of burning one furnace of steel and forging one furnace of steel, letting the furnace cool down before charging the steel ingots, to taking, forging, and adding at any time, so that the heating furnace worked continuously, and an assembly line operation method was adopted between the heating furnace and the steam hammer. Experiments were conducted on July 24th and 25th, and great achievements were made. The heating time was shortened by 57 to 66 percent, the maneuvering time [Note 2] increased to 70 percent, and the overall production capacity increased by more than doubled.

In the heat treatment workshop, from production equipment to technical operations, the Japanese methods were originally used. The annealing time for a furnace of steel was as long as 148 hours, averaging 88 hours, and the coal consumption per ton of steel reached 700 kilograms. Moreover, the quality of the products produced was not good. Comrade Galarov found that the problem was the unreasonable furnace structure. After making five modifications to the furnace, the annealing time for a furnace of steel was shortened to 26 to 30 hours, the production capacity increased by an average of 1.7 times, and the coal consumption per ton of steel was also reduced to more than 200 kilograms. In order to improve the quality of the steel, he also suggested annealing with bulk loading, and told the workers to pay attention to observing the combustion in the furnace and adjusting the air intake of the combustion chamber; controlling the flue damper to make the mechanical properties of the steel meet the qualified standards.

III

Realizing the suggestions of Soviet experts was not so easy, and it encountered various ideological obstacles. But these obstacles were overcome.

Soviet expert Comrade Zhuyev suggested seven recommendations to the steel ladle workers in the electric furnace workshop, such as not coating mud in the steel ladle; not adding water when repairing the steel ladle; and keeping the steel ladle clean. Some workers couldn't understand the reason. Old worker Liu Fukui said: "I don't know how much effort I spent learning how to add water to the steel ladle, why don't you want us to use it now?" Later, the laboratory tested a furnace of molten steel in the furnace, and the chemical composition was completely up to standard, but after the molten steel was poured into the steel ladle, the carbon content increased. The inspection revealed that it was because the mud and black smoke inside the steel ladle were not cleaned. In the face of such facts, everyone made up their minds to resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts and no longer let national property be lost.

In the past, many steelmaking workers in the electric furnace workshop did not pay much attention to the importance of elements, thinking that it was enough for the elements not to exceed the upper and lower limits [Note 3]. In fact, even if the chemical composition of some steel grades was qualified, they became waste products because the mechanical properties were not qualified. Comrade Zhuyev gave practical examples for everyone to listen to: for example, both carbon and chromium can increase the strength of steel, but chromium can reduce the impact value [Note 4] of steel. At this time, the steelmaking worker should pay attention to the fact that when carbon reaches the upper limit, chromium should reach the lower limit, otherwise the strength of the steel will be high, but the impact value will be unqualified. Speaking of this, he gave two very vivid metaphors. He said: "A steelmaking worker must make the proportions of various elements in steel appropriate, just like the conductor of an orchestra makes the music harmonious." He also said: "It's also like a tightrope walker in a circus, who must always maintain balance." After such repeated explanations, the workers understood this truth.

Here's another example. Soviet expert Comrade Galarov explained the operation of adding coal to the workers in the heat treatment workshop. He said: "Add less and add frequently. If you add too much coal, the temperature will drop instead. If you add too little, it will become an oxidizing flame, which will affect the quality of the steel." Many workers couldn't understand this reasoning. Furnace burner Sun Ruizhi said: "In the past, adding more coal didn't increase the temperature quickly, can adding less and adding frequently work?" One day, Sun Ruizhi was eating when Comrade Galarov came, and he explained to Sun Ruizhi: "Adding coal to the furnace is like a person eating. If you eat too fast and don't chew well, you will get indigestion. On the contrary, chewing one bite at a time and swallowing it is helpful to your health." Through this example, the workers quickly understood the truth of "add less and add frequently."

IV

"An enterprise is not a handicraft industry, it is an organic whole." Soviet experts often use this principle to help the Daye Steel Plant organize production work. Comrade Galarov found that the labor organization was unreasonable and the hierarchical responsibility system was not clear during the forging workshop's experiment with "high-temperature charging," which brought confusion and passivity to the work. In response to this situation, he put forward pertinent suggestions: The workshop should hold a five-minute meeting every morning, where the duty section chief and technicians report on the work of the previous day, the workshop director summarizes, and the work for the day is arranged. This system was implemented in other workshops and also played a great role.

Since June, the Daye Steel Plant has also implemented the weekly work plan and weekend meeting system suggested by Comrade Zhuyev, which has solved many key issues for the entire plant. For example, before the fifth weekend meeting, the forging workshop could only complete about 60 percent of the production plan each week, which often affected the completion of the entire plant's production plan. At the same time, the leading cadres of the workshop were skeptical about the expert's suggestion of "high-temperature charging" and were slow to implement it. At the weekend meeting, the leading cadres understood and studied this situation, criticized the forging workshop, and organized forces to assist in the implementation of the expert's suggestion. By the seventh weekend meeting, the forging workshop had exceeded the weekly work plan by 12 percent, and overfulfilled the production plan in August and September. In the past, the work plan compiled by the production section sometimes did not conform to the actual situation of the workshop. After opinions were raised at the weekend meeting, the production section's work of compiling the work plan was greatly improved.

Since September, the plant has gradually implemented day and night work plans and shift work plans on the basis of implementing the weekly work plan. A weekend meeting was established at the plant level, a five-minute meeting was established in the workshop, a section meeting was established in the section, and a pre-shift and post-shift meeting was established in the team.

The work plan and various meeting systems have formed the Daye Steel Plant into an organic whole.

Since August, all special steel has completed the production plan, reversing the situation of failing to complete the task for a long time. In October, the production task of the electric furnace workshop was 38 percent higher than that in September, and the plan was also completed. The quality of products throughout the plant has also been significantly improved. As a result of the implementation of the work plan, the production balance rate of each workshop has gradually increased, and the production cycle has been greatly shortened.

The implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions has brought about gratifying changes to the Daye Steel Plant.

[Note 1] Special steel is a type of high-quality steel.
[Note 2] Maneuvering time is the time the steam hammer participates in production.
[Note 3] The upper and lower limits are the highest and lowest content of a certain element in a certain steel.
[Note 4] Impact value is one of the mechanical properties of steel. It is a number that measures the hardness of steel.

    在苏联专家帮助下的大冶钢厂
    王澈
    一
    大冶钢厂的工人、技术人员和管理干部，怀着无限激动的心情，感谢苏联专家对他们的帮助。每当厂长高芸生同志谈到厂里特殊钢〔注一〕生产情况好转时，很自然就把苏联专家的帮助联系在一起。工程师苏能四在谈到苏联专家对他的技术帮助时说：“正如在迷失方向的航行中，找到了正确的指针一样。”电炉车间生产班长庞德金说：“苏联专家那种根据科学分析和科学试验来炼钢的工作态度，对于我‘靠眼力’‘凭经验’的老一套工作方法，是一个很好的教育。”
    今年一月间，大冶钢厂开始大量生产特殊钢。在新的生产任务面前，从领导到工人，从技术到管理，都缺乏足够的经验。因此，今年一月到六月，全厂检验合格的成品仅相当于生产计划总量的百分之四十七点二五四，严重地影响了国防建设和经济建设。此外，废品多、成本高，以及车间与车间的生产不协调，生产计划不能根据订货来制订，更是普遍的现象。
    六月间，苏联专家朱也夫同志和捷克加洛夫同志来了，他们给大冶钢厂带来了新面貌。在短短的
  一个多月中，两个专家作了二十多次有关技术和管理问题的报告，提出了二十四项重大的和一百六十
  一条一般的建议，并且亲自在电炉、锻造和热处理等生产特殊钢的车间进行了示范操作，解决了大冶钢厂在生产技术、技术管理和生产管理等方面长期不能解决的问题，使全厂的生产面貌，发生了根本的变化。
    二
    当时大冶钢厂最薄弱的环节是锻造车间和热处理车间。电炉车间生产出来的钢锭，往往因为锻造车间的生产能力小而不能锻制出来；锻造车间和轧钢车间生产出来的钢材，又因为热处理车间的退火时间长而不能及时交货。生产上存在严重的不平衡情况。
    苏联专家捷克加洛夫同志详细地研究了这种情况，在锻造车间提出“高温装料，快速加热，流水作业法”的建议，把过去烧一炉钢锻一炉钢，让炉子冷却后再装钢锭的落后方法，改为随取、随锻、随加，使加热炉不间断地工作，并且在加热炉与汽锤之间采用流水作业的方法。七月二十四和二十五日进行了试验，结果取得了很大成绩，加热时间缩短了百分之五十七到百分之六十六，机动时间〔注二〕增加到百分之七十，整个生产能力提高了一倍以上。
    在热处理车间，从生产设备到技术操作，原来都是沿用日本的办法。一炉钢材的退火时间，长达
  一百四十八小时，平均八十八小时，每吨钢材的煤消耗量达七百公斤，而且生产出来的产品质量不佳，捷克加洛夫同志研究出问题在炉子结构不合理。他把炉子作了五次修改之后，一炉钢材的退火时间缩短为二十六小时到三十小时，生产能力平均提高了一点七倍，每吨钢材的煤消耗量也降低到二百多公斤。为了提高钢材的质量，他又建议用散装方法退火，并且告诉工人注意观察炉内燃烧情况，调整燃烧室的进风量；控制烟道闸板，使钢材的机械性能达到了合格标准。
    三
    实现苏联专家建议并不是那么容易的，它曾经遇到各色各样的思想障碍。但是这些障碍都被克服了。
    苏联专家朱也夫同志建议电炉车间钢包工人，在钢包内不涂泥巴；修钢包不打水；钢包要干净等七条建议，有的工人想不通这个道理。老工人刘福奎说：“我不知花了许多工夫，才学会钢包打水的方法，怎么又不叫用了呢？”后来化验室化验了一炉在炉里的钢水，化学成分完全合乎规格，但是钢水倒在钢包里面后，炭的成分增高了，检查结果，发现是钢包里面的泥巴和黑烟没有扫干净的缘故。在这样的事实面前，大家才下定决心，坚决贯彻苏联专家建议，不再让国家财产受到损失。
    过去，电炉车间不少炼钢工，是不大注意元素的重要意义的，认为元素不超过上限下限〔注三〕就行了。实际上有的钢种化学成分即使合格了，而因机械性能不合格成为废品。朱也夫同志举出实际例子给大家听：比如炭和铬这两种元素，都能增加钢的强度，但铬能减少钢的冲击值〔注四〕，这时候炼钢工要注意炭到上限时，就要使铬到下限，不然钢的强度大，而冲击值不合格了。讲到这里，他又举了两个很生动的譬喻，他说：“一个炼钢工要使钢的各种元素比例适当，正像一个乐队的指挥手，使音乐和谐一样。”他又说：“也像马戏团走钢丝绳的人一样，要永远保持平衡。”经过这样的反复讲解，工人们才懂得了这个道理。
    还有这么一个例子。苏联专家捷克加洛夫同志在热处理车间给工人讲解加煤的操作，他说：“要少加勤添，煤加多了，温度反而下降，加少了就会成氧化性的火焰，影响钢的质量。”不少工人想不通这个道理，烧炉工人孙瑞芝就说：“过去多加煤温度还升得不快，少加勤添能行吗？”有一天，孙瑞芝正在吃饭，捷克加洛夫同志来了，他就给孙瑞芝解释说：“向炉里加煤就像一个人吃饭一样，如果吃得太快，咀嚼得不好，就会得消化不良症，相反的一口一口的咀嚼好了咽下去，对健康就有帮助。”工人们通过这个例子，很快的想通了“少加勤添”的道理。
    四
   “企业不是手工业，是一个有机整体。”苏联专家经常用这样的原则，来帮助大冶钢厂组织生产工作。捷克加洛夫同志从锻造车间试验“高温装料”过程中，发现劳动组织不合理，和逐级责任制不明确，给工作上带来了忙乱和被动。针对这种情况他提出了中肯的建议：车间每天早晨举行一次五分钟碰头会，由值班工段长、技术人员汇报前一天的工作，由车间主任小结，并布置当天的工作。这种制度推行到其他车间，同样起了很大的作用。
    从六月份起，大冶钢厂又实行了朱也夫同志建议的周作业计划和周末会议制度，解决了不少全厂性的关键问题。比如在第五次周末会议以前，锻造车间每周只能完成生产计划百分之六十左右，经常影响全厂生产计划的完成，同时车间领导干部对专家建议的“高温装料”抱怀疑态度，迟迟不能实现。周末会议上，领导干部了解和研究了这种情况后，批评了锻造车间，并组织力量协助实现了专家建议，到第七次周末会议，锻造车间就超额完成周作业计划百分之十二，八、九月份都超额完成了生产计划。过去，生产科编制的作业计划，有时候不符合车间的实际情况，经过周末会议提出意见，生产科的编制作业计划工作，有了很大的改进。
    从九月份起，该厂又在实行周作业计划的基础上，逐渐实行了昼夜作业计划与轮班作业计划。厂
  一级建立了周末会议，车间建立了五分钟碰头会，工段建立了工段会议，班组建立了班前班后会。
    作业计划和各种会议制度，把大冶钢厂组成一个有机整体。
    从八月份起，特殊钢全部完成了生产计划，扭转了长期完不成任务的局面。十月份，电炉车间的生产任务比九月份高百分之三十八，也完成了计划。全厂产品质量也有显著提高。执行作业计划的结果，各车间的生产均衡率已逐步提高，生产周期也大大缩短。
    实行苏联专家建议，给大冶钢厂带来了可喜的转变。
    〔注一〕特殊钢是属于优质钢的一种。
    〔注二〕机动时间是汽锤参加生产的时间。
    〔注三〕上限下限是某种元素在某种钢中最高的含量为上限，最低的含量为下限。
    〔注四〕冲击值是钢的机械性能之一种。是测量钢材硬性的数字。
