Nationwide Support for the Construction of Extra-High Voltage Transmission Lines in Northeast China

The construction of the 220,000-volt extra-high voltage transmission lines in Northeast China has received enthusiastic support from people all over the country. Workers in Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places manufactured 3,000 types of engineering materials with different specifications for this line project, including transmission lines, steel for iron towers, screws, and porcelain insulators. Employees of the Shenyang Wire Factory and the Tianjin Wire Factory specially trial-produced a new product of steel-cored aluminum wire for 220,000-volt extra-high voltage transmission. Employees of the Northeast Electric Power Iron Tower Factory worked day and night to rush produce steel for iron towers, which they had never manufactured before. During the construction process, many units also helped them solve the difficulties of lacking a large number of precision tools and equipment. For example, the No. 4 Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration lent four portable hand-operated water pumps to help drain water from foundation pits with little water accumulation because diesel engine pumps were not available. The "leveling and alignment" of the four tower legs and the grounding project required a large number of precision instruments. Electric power workers in Northeast China brought theodolites and surveyors to support them, and some even spared manpower to help. Twenty-one engineers and technicians and more than 600 testers, distribution workers, and oxyacetylene welders from units such as the 21st Engineering Company also came from other places to join this glorious construction team.

Farmers in eight counties and two cities along the line cut down trees that hindered the progress of the project to clear the way for the project. Many farmers, led by village cadres, also built 254 bridges and culverts and more than 230 kilometers of highways to facilitate transportation so that materials transported by train could be quickly delivered to the site. More than 2,000 local farmers also directly participated in the construction team to help the workers with construction. Youth League member Diao Zhengui learned the technology of mixing concrete soon after arriving at the construction site. Farmers in Darenjing Village harvested crops during the day and drove eight or nine carts at night to transport sand and gravel to the construction site, ensuring the supply of materials on site.

People from all over the country are concerned about the progress of this project. The people of Changchun City specially formed a delegation of people from all walks of life to visit the construction site. They performed more than 20 literary and artistic programs such as "Letters Brought Back from the Front," "Motor Vehicle Soldiers," and "Lu Bu and Diao Chan." A large number of letters of comfort and twelve boxes of books, periodicals, comic strips and other comfort items brought were also distributed to various construction sites. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国各地支援东北区超高压送电线的建设
    东北区二十二万伏超高压送电线的建设，得到了各地人民的热烈支援。沈阳、鞍山、大连、上海、天津、北京等地的许多工人，为这个线路工程制造了三千种不同规格的送电线、铁塔钢材、螺丝、瓷瓶等工程材料。沈阳电线厂和天津电线厂职工，特地为它试制了二十二万伏超高压送电的钢芯铝线新产品。东北电业铁塔厂职工日夜赶制过去从未制造过的铁塔钢材。在施工中，有许多单位还帮助他们解决了缺乏大批精密工具设备的困难。例如积水较少的基础坑不能用柴油发动机抽水，有色金属工业管理局第四工程公司职工就借给了四台轻便的手压水泵，帮助抽水。四个塔腿的“抄平找正”和接地工程都需要大批的精密仪器，东北各地电业职工就把经纬仪和测定器等拿来支援他们，有的还抽出人力来帮助。二十一工程公司等单位的二十一位工程师、技术人员和六百多名试验工、配电工、火焊工等，也都从别处赶来参加了这个光荣的建设队伍。
    沿线路的八个县两个市的农民们，为了帮助建设这个线路，曾砍去了有碍工程进行的林木，为工程开路。许多农民还在村干部的率领下，修筑了二百五十四个桥梁、涵洞和二百三十多公里的公路，以便利交通运输，让火车运来的材料可以很快地送到现场。当地还有两千多农民直接参加了建设队伍，帮助工人建设。青年团员刁振贵到工地不久，就学会了搅拌混凝土的技术。大仁境村农民白天收割庄稼，晚上赶八、九辆大车给工地运送砂石，保证现场材料的供应。
    各地人民都关怀着这个工程的进展。长春市人民特地组成各界人民慰问代表团，到工地进行慰问。他们演出了“前方捎回来的信”、“汽车兵”、
  “吕布与貂蝉”等二十多个文艺节目。带来的大批慰问信和十二箱书刊、连环画等慰问品，也已分发到各个工地。（新华社）
