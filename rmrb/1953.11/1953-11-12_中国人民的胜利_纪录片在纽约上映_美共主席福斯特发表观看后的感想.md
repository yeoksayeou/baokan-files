Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th. According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker," the color documentary "The Victory of the Chinese People" premiered at the Stanley Theater in New York on October 31st. William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party USA, wrote a letter to the "Daily Worker" about his thoughts after watching it.

His letter, published in the "Daily Worker" on the 5th, stated: "The Victory of the Chinese People" is an excellent new film, undoubtedly one of the best of all the greatest documentaries ever made.

This film depicts how the People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Mao Zedong, fought victoriously to overthrow the domestic reactionaries and the imperialists who had long sucked the blood of China, and to win China's liberation.

Foster said in his letter: When I watched this great film, I was deeply moved by the great revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm of the Chinese people. It simply permeated the entire film—the courageous spirit of the People's Army in battle, the actions of the peasants supporting the front lines, the large-scale mass victory parades held in the captured cities, and the vigorous and vibrant spirit of the people on every occasion. Although Chiang Kai-shek's army initially had numerical superiority and the latest American military equipment, it never could cope with this irresistible People's Liberation Army.

Foster further said in his letter: The great revolutionary movement of the Chinese people to win independence is movingly portrayed in this film. It foreshadows the same people's revolution for independence that is about to occur throughout Asia, not to mention Africa, Latin America, and other colonial and semi-colonial regions.

This great film screened at the Stanley Theater truly inspired every thoughtful worker, while it could only deeply shock and dismay all imperialists and their running dogs. Wall Street's dream of ruling China will never come true.

    “中国人民的胜利”纪录片在纽约上映
    美共主席福斯特发表观看后的感想
    【新华社柏林十日电】据纽约“工人日报”报道：“中国人民的胜利”彩色纪录片于十月三十一日在纽约斯坦莱剧院首次上映。美国共产党主席威廉·兹·福斯特看后写了一封信给“工人日报”，谈他观后的感想。
    刊载在五日“工人日报”上的他的信说：“中国人民的胜利”这部新影片好极了，毫无疑问，它是历来所有最伟大的纪录影片中最好的片子之一。
    这部影片描写人民解放军怎样在共产党与毛泽东的领导下，为打倒国内反动派以及长期吮吸中国血液的帝国主义者，为争取中国的解放而进行了胜利的战斗。
    福斯特在他的信中说：当我观看这部伟大的影片时，我深深感到中国人民的伟大的革命精神与热情。它简直充满了整个影片——人民军队在战斗中的勇敢精神、农民支援前线的行动、在攻克的城市里举行的大规模群众胜利游行、人民在任何场合下的蓬勃焕发的精神。尽管蒋介石的军队在最初占数量上的优势，并且有着最新式的美国军事装备，但是它从来不曾对付得了这支势不可挡的人民解放军。
    福斯特在他的信中又说：中国人民争取独立的伟大的革命运动在这部影片中令人感动地表现出来。它预示着全亚洲将要发生的同样的争取独立的人民革命，且不提非洲、拉丁美洲及其他殖民与半殖民地地区。
    斯坦莱剧院所放映的这部伟大影片，真正地鼓舞了每一个有头脑的工人，而使所有帝国主义分子和他们的走狗只能深感震惊和悲观。华尔街统治中国的梦想永远不会实现了。
