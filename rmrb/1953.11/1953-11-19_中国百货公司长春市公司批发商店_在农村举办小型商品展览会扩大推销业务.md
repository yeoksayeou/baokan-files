    China Department Store Changchun City Company Wholesale Store
    Expands Sales by Holding Small Commodity Exhibitions in Rural Areas
    The China Department Store Changchun City Company Wholesale Store has adopted the method of holding small commodity exhibitions in rural areas to bring national industrial products face-to-face with farmers in order to expand sales. At the exhibitions in Mishazi and Helong, the turnover exceeded 745 million yuan.
    In the past, the wholesale store adopted methods such as holding joint meetings of business staff, planners, and directors of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives, inviting them to visit samples, and formulating sales plans. Leaders and salespeople took samples to grassroots cooperatives to help promote sales, and adopted methods such as cyclical delivery of goods to suburban cooperatives, which achieved certain results in expanding sales. However, since national industrial products could not directly meet with farmers, suburban rural cooperatives were unable to understand the specific needs of farmers. The purchasing staff of grassroots cooperatives were afraid that the goods they bought back would not be wanted by the sales staff, and they did not know what farmers actually wanted, so they could only order goods according to the list. This was the basic problem existing in the operation of rural grassroots cooperatives. In response to this situation, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, the wholesale store, after joint research with the Changchun City Cooperative General Office, decided to select varieties suitable for the needs of rural areas after autumn in Mishazi in the Misha district and the central Helong in the Helong district, and held small commodity exhibitions.
    The harvest of this exhibition was very large: First of all, it was understood that the demand for industrial products by farmers has expanded. When the women's representatives from Mishazi saw a cotton cadre uniform priced at 100,000 yuan, they and other farmer representatives praised it for being good quality, cheap, and stylish, saving money compared to making it themselves. However, they pointed out that farmers cannot wear cadre uniforms with hanging pockets, and it would be better if they were uniform-style. When they saw velvet gloves, striped cloth, and velvet shirts, they asked the salesperson: Why didn't we have such things that are tight, strong, and warm in the past? They requested that more be supplied in the future. It can be seen from this that the lives of farmers have improved, and after women participate in labor production, they now want machine-made industrial products to replace the handicrafts they relied on in the past. It was also learned at the meeting that a family of seventeen farmers bought seventeen velvet shirts. As the member of the Helong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party said to the comrades of the cooperative at the exhibition: Nowadays, in rural areas, we are not afraid of not selling money, but afraid of not having complete goods. Secondly, it helps cooperatives increase the variety of goods they operate, and overcomes the phenomenon of commodity backlog or stock-out caused by blindly purchasing goods. In the past, rural grassroots cooperatives did not well study the actual requirements of farmers, and blindly pursued brand-name goods, resulting in a backlog of some commodities. The women's representatives said when they saw relatively cheap vanishing cream: We want to buy this kind, but the cooperatives are full of Butterfly Cream and White Bear Fat, which are quite expensive. The elderly also said: Our rural areas are not like the city, where we have to use 3,000 or 4,000 yuan a tube of 口得意 or Wrigley's Spearmint toothpaste. It is just as hygienic to buy a box of Peace toothpaste for elementary school students, as long as it costs 1,000 yuan. For example, farmers want cheaper Friendly brand and New Production brand cigarettes, but the cooperative only has Daqianmen and Red Golden cigarettes. On the other hand, the salesperson cannot see the samples, does not know whether they meet the needs of the farmers, and dares not order goods. The salesperson of Helong Street Cooperative had seen the 69×60 blue cloth in the commodity catalog in the past, but dared not order it. This time, after seeing the sample, he ordered forty bolts. The salespersons of the cooperatives in each village led the farmer representatives to order the purchase plan. The Dongshan Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative added thirty-eight new commodities through the exhibition. The directors of the grassroots cooperatives felt that this sales method was good and requested that it be held at the beginning of each quarter. Again, it expanded sales. Commodities that were previously considered to be backlogged found a market in rural areas. Camel brand socks have been backlogged for a year, but this time farmers liked that the thread was thick, strong, and resistant to wear, and were willing to buy them. The 2,800 yuan per foot blue twill was not very popular in the city, and the cooperative purchasing staff also disliked the poor quality, but the farmers liked that it was cheap and stronger than white fine cloth, and requested that the cooperative purchase it. It deeply educated the purchasing staff of the cooperative, and made them realize that the previous saying that many commodities in the wholesale store were of poor quality and did not meet the needs of the masses was wrong. The leaders and sales staff of the wholesale store also realized that in order to expand sales and meet the requirements of farmers, they must help cooperatives solve practical problems. Because the cooperative purchases goods according to the needs of farmers, it has established the prestige of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in rural areas, and expanded the sales position.
    The following experiences were gained in this exhibition: 1. To make the meeting successful, the local party committee must pay attention to it. For example, the secretaries of the Misha and Helong District Committees of the Chinese Communist Party personally participated in the exhibition and led the farmer representatives to visit, so the meeting was better. 2. Small exhibitions should be held at the beginning of a quarter, especially before seasonal changes and the formulation of quarterly plans, so that procurement can be organized according to the needs of farmers. The shortcomings of this meeting were: the invited representatives were not broad enough, so they did not provide many opinions on the supply. At the same time, not many samples were brought, only one-tenth of the existing varieties in the store were taken, which could not meet the requirements of farmers. In addition, the meeting was held too late, and these should be improved.

    中国百货公司长春市公司批发商店
    在农村举办小型商品展览会扩大推销业务
    中国百货公司长春市公司批发商店采用在农村举办小型商品展览会的办法，使国家工业品和农民见面，以扩大推销业务。批发商店在米沙子和合隆两地展览会上，成交额就在七亿四千五百万元以上。
    过去批发商店在结合合作社方面，采取了召开国营商业和合作社的营业员、计划员、主任的联席会的方法，邀请他们参观样品，制订推销计划；领导上和营业员带着样品到基层社帮助推销，对郊区社采取循环送货等办法，对扩大推销上有一定成绩。但由于国家工业品不能和农民直接见面，郊区农村合作社对农民的具体需要摸不清。基层合作社的采购员怕买回货去营业员不要，不知道农民到底要些啥，只好照单要货，这是农村基层合作社经营上存在的基本的问题。批发商店针对这一情况，在第四季度初经和长春市合作总社共同研究，确定在米沙区的米沙子和合隆区的中心合隆两地，选出适合农村秋后需要的品种，举行了小型商品展览会。
    这次展览会的收获是很大的：首先是了解农民对工业品的需要量是扩大了。当米沙子妇女代表看见了十万元一件棉干部服时，和其他农民代表都称赞物美、价廉、样式好，比自己做还省钱。但他们提出农民不能穿吊兜的干部服，要是制服式的就好了。他们看见绒手套、条布、绒衬衣，就向营业员提出：这样的东西紧衬结实暖和，为啥过去没有呢？要求以后多多供应。这里可以看出农民生活提高了，妇女们参加劳动生产后，过去靠手工缝现在要求以机器生产的工业品来代替了。会上还了解到一家农民十七口人就买了十七件绒衣。正如中共合隆区区委委员在展览会上向合作社同志们所说的：如今农村不怕不卖钱，就怕货不全。其次，帮助合作社增加经营品种，克服了由于盲目进货而造成商品积压或脱销现象。农村基层合作社过去没有很好地研究农民的实际要求，盲目追求名牌货，造成部分商品积压。妇女代表看见比较便宜的雪花膏都说：我们想买这样的，可是合作社尽是些蝶霜、白熊脂，都挺贵。老年人也说：我们乡下不像城里非用三、四千元一支的口得意、留兰香牙膏，和平牙膏给小学生买一盒也一样讲卫生，只要一千元。再如农民要价低一些的友好牌、新生产牌香烟，但合作社只有大前门、红金香烟。另一方面是营业员看不见样品，不知道是否合乎农民需要，不敢进货。合隆街合作社营业员过去在商品目录上见过六九×六○的青布，但不敢进货。这回一看样品，就进了四十匹。各村合作社的营业员都领着农民代表订进货计划。东山村供销合作社通过展览会新增加了三十八种商品。基层合作社的主任们都感到这种推销方法好，要求在每一季度的开始举行一次。再次，扩大了推销，过去认为是积压的商品，在农村中找到了市场。骆驼牌袜子积压一年了，这次会上农民却喜欢它线粗、结实、抗磨，都愿买。二千八百元一尺的青斜纹城市里没大有人买，合作社采购员也嫌质量差，但农民都喜欢它价钱便宜，比白细布强，要求合作社采购。深刻地教育了合作社采购员，使他们认识到过去叫喊批发商店很多商品质量不好、不合群众需要的说法是不对的。批发商店的领导上和推销工作人员，也体会到要想扩大推销满足农民的要求，必须帮助合作社解决实际问题。由于合作社根据农民需要进货，树立了国营商业、合作社在农村中的威信，扩大了推销阵地。
    这次展览会中得到如下的体会：一、要使会议开得好，必须当地党委重视。如这次中共米沙区合隆区的区委书记亲自参加展览会，率领农民代表去参观，因而会议开得较好。二、举办小型展览会应在一季之初，特别应在季节变化和编制季度计划之前，这样才能根据农民的要求来组织进货。这次会议的缺点是：邀请代表不太广泛，因而对供应上提供意见不多。同时携带的样品不多，只拿去商店现有品种的十分之一，不能满足农民的要求。另外开会的时期较晚，这些都是应该改进的。
