The recent negotiations between the delegation from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the delegation from the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the signing of the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, is a major international event.

At a time when the American aggressors are using every means to disrupt the peaceful resolution of the Korean question and intend to completely undermine the armistice agreement, the success of the Sino-Korean negotiations and the signing of the agreement are even more significant. Because in the negotiations, the convening of a political conference to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue was first discussed, and a consensus was reached. As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech at the signing ceremony: "It shows that the people of China and North Korea have a common determination to fight to the end for the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. It shows that the Chinese people will continue to support the just cause of the Korean people until the final victory."

The signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement not only fixes the friendship between the two countries in the form of a treaty, but more importantly, further consolidates and develops, strengthens and expands this friendship. As everyone knows, the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is a long-standing traditional friendship. In history, the people of China and North Korea have carried out many joint struggles against common enemies. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War, many Korean patriots fought side by side with the Chinese people, and many Korean comrades shed their last drop of blood on Chinese soil. Especially in the recent three-year war against American imperialist aggression against Korea, this combat-based flesh-and-blood friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has developed further. China's resistance to American aggression and aid to Korea is also defending our homeland, and North Korea's defense of its country is also defending China's security.

Now, every Korean and every Chinese deeply understands how precious this flesh-and-blood friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is, and what a tremendous force it is. It is this friendship that has defended the freedom and independence of North Korea, guaranteed China's security, achieved victory in the war, and realized the armistice in Korea. It is precisely because of this that the Chinese people especially sympathize with the suffering of the Korean people due to the destruction of the war, and are particularly concerned about the restoration and development of the national economy in North Korea after the war. Because the Chinese people deeply understand that without the Korean people's support for the victory in the war against American imperialist aggression with their lives and property, the American aggressors would have expanded the war to China, and the Chinese people would not have been able to live a peaceful and happy life, and it would not have been possible to carry out the construction of the Five-Year Plan so quickly. Therefore, it is the Chinese people's unshirkable responsibility to help the Korean people heal the wounds of war. Moreover, the Chinese people also deeply understand that every achievement in the restoration and construction of North Korea also strengthens the strength of the Chinese and Korean people against common enemies, and also increases China's security guarantee. It can be seen that this agreement is entirely in the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Korean people.

We should also recognize that the agreement signed between China and North Korea is a truly friendly and mutually beneficial agreement, and also a truly peaceful agreement. This agreement stipulates that China and North Korea provide each other with all possible economic and technical assistance, carry out necessary economic and technical cooperation, and at the same time promote cultural exchanges between the two countries. According to the Sino-Korean Negotiation Communiqué, in addition to giving all the materials and expenses used to aid North Korea from the beginning of the war against aggression to the end of this year free of charge to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, our government also decided to give the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea a huge sum of 80,000 billion yuan free of charge in the four years from 1954 to 1957. This money will be used to supply the Korean people with coal, cloth, cotton, grain, building materials, transportation equipment, metal products, machines, farm tools, fishing boats, paper stationery, and so on. This means that all the materials we provide to the Korean people are to help them restore production, carry out construction, and improve their lives. The implementation of this agreement will surely enable the Korean people to get rid of the war disaster faster and build their peaceful life faster. Therefore, the implementation of this agreement is not only conducive to the restoration and development of the national economy of North Korea, but also conducive to the peace cause in the Far East and the world.

We should recognize that the restoration and development of the national economy of North Korea is not only the common interest of the people of China and North Korea, but also the interest of the entire peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, supporting the restoration and development of the national economy of North Korea is not only our Chinese people, but also the entire peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The people of these countries had great sympathy for the Korean people during the Korean War and provided assistance in various ways; some countries sent people's delegations to North Korea to express their condolences to the Korean soldiers and civilians, such as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Mongolian People's Republic; some countries organized volunteer medical surgical teams to North Korea to serve the war against aggression, such as Hungary and Romania; and the Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries donated a large number of materials to support the heroic struggle of the Korean people. After the cessation of the war, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and the Mongolian People's Republic successively decided to assist in the restoration and construction of North Korea. What is especially important is that in September this year, the Soviet government decided to give the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 1 billion rubles free of charge in order to help the Korean people recover from the war wounds. This huge sum of money will be used to restore the huge Shuifeng Power Plant on the Yalu River, restore and build ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting factories, including the steel plants in Chongjin and Kimchaek, and the non-ferrous metal plant in Nampo; restore and build chemical and cement factories, including the mineral fertilizer factory in Hungnam, the cement factory in Seung-ho-ri, and build textile and food industry enterprises, including the construction of large textile factories, silk factories, and other food factories. The people of all fraternal countries deeply understand that the Korean people have not only defended the security of North Korea, but also defended world peace, and the losses and sacrifices of North Korea in the war are also the losses and sacrifices of the entire peace camp. Therefore, all fraternal countries have a common sincere wish to help the Korean people quickly heal the wounds of war, and at the same time quickly reach a common economic upsurge with other fraternal countries, which will strengthen the strength of the entire peace camp.

Now, the Korean people, who have won a great victory in the war, are contributing all their strength to restoring the wounds of war and rebuilding their motherland. We believe that the brave and hardworking Korean people, the Korean people who have been severely tested by more than three years of war against aggression, with the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, and with the generous assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve greater achievements in the cause of restoring and building their motherland.

    永远在巩固和发展的友谊
    马纳
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团，最近举行了谈判，并且签订了经济及文化合作协定，这是国际上的一桩大事。
    当美国侵略者正在采用一切办法捣乱朝鲜问题的和平解决、打算彻底破坏停战协定的时候，中朝两国谈判的成功和协定的签订就更具有重大意义了。因为在谈判中，首先就对召开政治会议争取和平解决朝鲜问题进行了讨论，并且取得了一致意见。正像周恩来总理在签字仪式上的讲话中指出的：“它表示中朝两国人民有共同的决心，愿为彻底实现朝鲜停战协定、争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底。它表示中国人民将继续支持朝鲜人民的正义事业，直到最后的胜利。”
    中朝经济及文化合作协定的签订，不仅仅是把中朝两国友谊用条约的形式固定下来了，更重要的是把这种友谊进一步巩固和发展，加强和扩大了。大家知道，中朝两国人民的友谊是由来已久的传统友谊。在历史上，中朝人民为了反对共同的敌人曾经进行过多次共同的斗争，尤其在抗日战争中曾经有很多的朝鲜志士和中国人民并肩作战，也有不少的朝鲜战友在中国的土地上流尽了他们的最后一滴血。特别在最近三年反抗美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争中，中朝人民这种战斗的血肉的友谊有了更进一步的发展。中国人民的抗美援朝同时就是保家卫国，朝鲜人民的保卫祖国，同时也保卫了中国的安全。
    现在，每一个朝鲜人和每一个中国人都深深懂得，中朝两国人民这种血肉友谊是多么值得珍贵，是一种多么巨大的力量。就是这种友谊保卫了朝鲜的自由和独立，保障了中国的安全，取得了战争的胜利，实现了朝鲜的停战。正是因为这样，中国人民才特别同情朝鲜人民由于战争破坏而遭受的苦难，特别关心朝鲜战后国民经济的恢复和发展。因为中国人民深深懂得，要是没有朝鲜人民用生命和财产支持了反对美帝国主义侵略战争取得胜利，美国侵略者就要把战争扩大到中国来，中国人民就不可能过和平幸福的生活，也就不可能这样快就进行五年计划的建设了。所以，帮助朝鲜人民医治战争创伤，是中国人民义不容辞的责任。而且，中国人民同样深深懂得，朝鲜恢复和建设的每一成就，也就是壮大了一分中朝人民反对共同敌人的力量，也就是增加了中国人民的一分安全保障。由此可见，这一协定是完全符合中朝两国人民的根本利益的。
    我们还应该认识：中朝两国签订的协定是真正友好互助的协定，也是真正和平的协定。这一协定规定中朝两国互相给予各种可能的经济和技术的援助，进行必要的经济和技术的合作，同时促进两国文化的交流。按照中朝谈判公报，我国政府除了把从朝鲜反侵略战争开始到今年年底止，援助朝鲜的一切物资和用费全部无偿地赠送给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府外，还决定在一九五四年至一九五七年的四年内无代价地赠送朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府八万亿元的巨款，用这笔款项来供给朝鲜人民煤炭、布匹、棉花、粮食、建筑器材、交通器材、金属制品、机器、农具、渔船以及纸张文具等等。这就是说我们支援朝鲜人民的全部物资是为了帮助他们恢复生产，进行建设和改善生活的。这一协定的实现，一定会使朝鲜人民更快地摆脱战争灾难，更快地建设他们的和平生活。因此，这一协定的实现，不但有利于朝鲜国民经济的恢复和发展，同时有利于远东和世界的和平事业。
    我们应该认识，朝鲜国民经济的恢复和发展，不仅仅是中朝两国人民的共同利益，也是整个以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的利益，因此，支援朝鲜国民经济恢复和发展的，也就不单单是我们中国人民，还有整个以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营。这些国家的人民在朝鲜战争中，就对朝鲜人民抱着极大的同情，并且用各种方式进行了援助；有的国家派遣了人民代表团到朝鲜慰问朝鲜军民，如波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和蒙古人民共和国；有的国家组织了志愿医疗手术队到朝鲜为反侵略战争服务，如匈牙利、罗马尼亚；而苏联和所有人民民主国家都捐赠了大批物资，支援朝鲜人民的英勇斗争。战争停止以后，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利以及蒙古人民共和国又先后决定援助朝鲜的恢复和建设。尤其重要的是，今年九月苏联政府为了帮助朝鲜人民恢复战争创伤，决定无代价地赠送朝鲜民主主义人民共和国十亿卢布，用这笔巨大款项来恢复鸭绿江上巨大的水丰发电厂，恢复和建设黑色金属和有色金属冶炼工厂，其中包括城津市和金策市的炼钢厂、南浦的有色金属厂；恢复和建设化学和水泥工厂，其中包括兴南的矿质肥料工厂，胜湖里的水泥工厂以及建设纺织和食品工业企业包括建设大纺织工厂、丝织工厂和其他食品工厂。所有兄弟国家的人民都深深懂得，朝鲜人民不仅仅是保卫了朝鲜的安全，也保卫了世界和平，朝鲜在战争中的损失和牺牲，也是整个和平阵营的损失和牺牲。因此，所有兄弟国家都有一个共同的真诚愿望，就是帮助朝鲜人民迅速医好战争创伤，同时迅速和其他兄弟国家达到共同的经济高涨，这将会加强整个和平阵营的力量。
      现在，在战争中取得伟大胜利的朝鲜人民，正在为恢复战争创伤和重建祖国贡献一切力量。我们相信，勇敢而又勤劳的朝鲜人民，经过三年多反侵略战争严重考验的朝鲜人民，有朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的英明领导，有苏联、中国以及其他兄弟国家的慷慨援助，他们一定能够克服一切困难，在恢复和建设祖国的事业中取得更大成就。
