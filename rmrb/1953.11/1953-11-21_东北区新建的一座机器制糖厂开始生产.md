Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th—The first machine sugar factory in Northeast China built using domestic machinery—the Heping Sugar Factory (formerly known as Songha Sugar Factory)—has been completed and put into production on November 20th.

　　The Heping Sugar Factory is a local state-owned industrial enterprise under the jurisdiction of Songjiang Province. Construction of the factory began in May 1952, covering an area of 40,000 square meters. It can produce 18,000 tons of sugar annually, making it the largest machine sugar factory in Northeast China. The factory's mechanical equipment weighs 2,000 tons, including more than 420 types of machinery, all manufactured by machine manufacturing plants in Dalian, Shenyang, Harbin, and other places based on Soviet design data. The quality of the machinery is very good; in many respects, it is superior to the machinery imported from capitalist countries by older sugar factories. For example, operations such as the opening and closing of the diffusion tank bottom doors, lime kiln ash removal, and the handling of waste vegetable matter were all manual labor in the old machines. The new machines have replaced these heavy manual labor tasks with mechanical operations. The new machines not only have high production efficiency, but the quality of the sugar produced is also superior to that of the old factories. The purity of the sugar is 99.7 percent, and it is expected to reach 99.8 percent once production is normalized. The color of the sugar is very white. The sugar recovery rate from sugar beets has reached international standards.

　　The Heping Sugar Factory began preparing for production at the same time as the factory was being built. As early as 1951, it trained more than 200 sugar-making technicians in the Acheng Sugar Factory and the Harbin Sugar Factory. The more than 1,000 workers and technicians needed by the factory, as well as the various materials required, were prepared before the completion of the factory construction. Twenty days before the start of operations, the fourth quarter and monthly production plans were prepared, production targets were determined, and management systems were initially formulated. Trial runs and production began in an orderly manner immediately after the completion of the factory construction. The construction of the Heping Sugar Factory has inspired farmers and received their strong support. More than 25,000 households of farmers in areas such as Lalin, Bayan, Wuchang, Shuangcheng, and Pingfang have planted more than 100,000 mu of sugar beets for the sugar factory, ensuring the supply of raw materials. At the same time, the farmers who planted sugar beets also received assistance from the agricultural affairs stations set up by the sugar factory in various places in selecting superior varieties and planting techniques. As a result, despite internal flooding this year, they still achieved 70 percent of the expected harvest. Farmers earn one to two times more income from planting sugar beets than from planting other crops.

    东北区新建的一座机器制糖厂开始生产
    【新华社哈尔滨二十日电】东北区第一座运用国内机械设备兴建的机器制糖厂——和平糖厂（前称松哈糖厂）业已建成，在十一月二十日投入生产。
    和平糖厂是松江省所属地方国营工业。建厂工程从一九五二年五月开始建筑，面积四万平方公尺。每年可产砂糖一万八千吨，是东北区最大的一个机器制糖厂。全厂机械设备重两千吨，包括四百二十余种机械，都是由大连、沈阳、哈尔滨等地机械制造厂根据苏联设计资料制造的。机器质量很好，很多地方较旧有糖厂从资本主义国家输入的机器优越，例如渗出罐罐底门开关，石灰窑出灰，处理废菜等很多操作过程，旧有机器都是体力劳动，新的机器已将这些繁重的体力劳动用机械来操作，新的机器不仅生产效率高，所产的糖的质量也优于旧有的厂，砂糖纯度为百分之九九点七，待生产走入正常后可达到百分之九九点八，糖的颜色很白。甜菜含糖回收率达到了国际标准。
    和平糖厂在建厂同时就着手进行生产准备工作，早在一九五一年就在阿城糖厂，哈尔滨糖厂中训练了二百多名制糖技术工人。全厂所需的千余工人和技术人员，所需的各种材料，在建厂工程结束前就准备好了。在开工前二十天编制了第四季度与月度生产计划，确定了生产指标，初步制定了管理方面的制度。在建厂工程结束后立即有秩序地进行试车与开工生产。和平糖厂的兴建鼓舞了农民并得到农民的大力支援，拉林、巴彦、五常、双城、平房等地区两万五千余户农民，为糖厂种植了十余万亩甜菜，保证了原料供应。同时种甜菜的农民又得到了糖厂设在各地的农务站在选定优良品种及种菜技术等方面的帮助，因而在今年有内涝的情况下还得到了七成的收成。农民们种甜菜比种其他农作物可多收入一倍至二倍。
