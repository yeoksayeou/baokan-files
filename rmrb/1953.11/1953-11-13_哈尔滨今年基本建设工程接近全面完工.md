    Harbin's Capital Construction Projects Nearing Overall Completion
    Harbin's capital construction projects are nearing overall completion this year. As of the end of October, the city's projects have reached an average of 87.28% of the total progress, and key projects have reached 88.78% of the annual plan. The city has completed an area of more than 548,000 square meters. Currently, about 90% of the city's projects are proceeding with internal construction work.
    The capital construction sites in the city have made great efforts in the production increase and economy practice campaign, especially in overcoming complacency, which has achieved significant results. After education on overcoming complacency, the broad masses of workers have demonstrated great enthusiasm and creativity. In the past, many workers in the First Engineering Office of the Industrial Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering requested to return to Guanli (关里, inside Shanhaiguan Pass) for the winter. After overcoming complacency, those who were not content with their work abandoned their "small plans" and expressed their determination to complete this year's tasks. Recently, the daily progress rate has increased from 0.44% to more than 1.1%, and the daily progress rate of some projects has risen to a maximum of 2.6%. In the campaign to overcome complacency, all units have seized the opportunity to formulate completion plans, which has promoted the progress of the projects. For example, after the completion of the external engineering of most construction sites of the Harbin No. 1 Construction Company, internal construction operation plans were formulated in a timely manner, so that the projects could be carried out continuously and systematically. Through the campaign to overcome complacency, the implementation of the responsibility system has been further promoted. In the Second Construction Site of the First Engineering Company of the Central Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, there were 32 construction workers, but only six stayed at the construction site due to the cold weather, resulting in no one to take care of the work in the evening, and the system of handover and inspection was also relaxed, resulting in slow progress and small quality accidents. In the struggle against complacency, the construction workers implemented a special responsibility contracting system for sub-items of the project, strengthened the guidance of on-site construction, and played a significant role in accelerating the progress of the project and ensuring quality. In the struggle against complacency, advanced experiences have been further promoted. The Eighth Construction Site of the First Engineering Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry promoted the three-dimensional parallel rapid construction method, which made it possible to complete projects that were in danger of spanning years within the year. The Fourth Workshop of the Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory widely promoted the assembly line operation method, which increased the construction efficiency several times.
    At present, in Harbin City, the external works such as roofing and plastering of a few projects have not been completed, and new signs of complacency are occasionally discovered. Some construction sites do not pay enough attention to cold protection, and minor injuries still occur from time to time. This requires all construction sites to persist in their efforts, mobilize the masses, and strive for the victorious and comprehensive completion of the plan. (Jiang Min)

    哈尔滨今年基本建设工程接近全面完工
    哈尔滨市今年基本建设工程已接近全面完工。截至十月底，全市工程平均已达到总进度的百分之八十七点二八，重点工程进度已达到全年计划的百分之八十八点七八。全市竣工面积已有五十四万八千多平方公尺。目前占全市百分之九十左右的工程正紧张地进行内部施工。
    该市各基本建设工地在增产节约竞赛中作了很大的努力，特别在反松劲思想上收到显著的效果。广大职工经过反松劲思想的教育，发挥了很大的积极性与创造性。中央建筑工程部工业工程公司第一工程处，原来有不少工人要求回关里过冬，经过反松劲思想，不安心工作的人都放弃了“小计划”，表示要坚决完成今年的任务。最近日进度已由百分之点四四提高到一点一以上，有的工程日进度最高上升到百分之二点六。各单位在反松劲思想中，抓紧制订了竣工计划，对工程进度起了推动作用。如哈尔滨市第一工程公司大部分工地于外部工程完成后，及时地制订了内部施工作业计划，使工程坚持不懈地有计划地进行施工。通过反松劲思想，进一步推动了责任制的贯彻。中央有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司二工地有三十二名施工员，因气候渐冷只有六人留宿工地，致使晚间的工作无人料理，也放松了交代与检查制度，因而进度迟缓，小的质量事故不断发生。在反松劲思想斗争中，施工员按分部分项工程实行了专责包干制，加强了现场施工的指导，对加速工程进度和保证质量起了很大的作用。在反松劲斗争中，进一步推广了先进经验。中央第二机械工业部第一工程处第八工地推广了立体平行快速施工法，使有跨年度危险的工程，可能在年内完工。量具刃具厂四车间普遍推广了流水作业法，使施工效率提高了数倍。
    目前哈尔滨市尚有少数工程的房盖、抹灰等外部工程没有完工，新的松劲思想时有发现，有的工地对防寒工作重视不够，轻伤事故还不断发生。这就需要各工地坚持努力，发动群众，为胜利地全面完成计划而奋斗。（姜民）
