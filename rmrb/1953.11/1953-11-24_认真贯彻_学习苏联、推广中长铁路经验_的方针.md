Earnestly Implement the Policy of "Learning from the Soviet Union and Promoting the Experience of the China Changchun Railway"
Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government

In the new historical period of our motherland—the period of realizing national industrialization and gradually transitioning to socialism—the task before all railway employees in the country is to serve national industrialization and national defense modernization, and to maximize the satisfaction of the country's planned economic construction and the people's growing demands for railway transportation in production and life. To this end, we must do a good job in capital construction and further unleash the potential of existing railways, increase transportation capacity, reduce transportation costs, and accumulate more funds for national construction. To this end, we must learn from the advanced experience and advanced methods of the Soviet railways. The experience of the China Changchun Railway is the product of the combination of Soviet experience and China's specific conditions. During the thirty-two months of Sino-Soviet joint operation, it became a model for the advancement of the national railways with its outstanding high efficiency, low cost, and high profit. According to the situation in the first ten months of this year, the proportion of its cargo tons sent and profits turned over continues to rise. The advanced experience of the China Changchun Railway can be applied to all railways in the country.

In June of this year, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government determined that learning and promoting the experience of the China Changchun Railway is the policy of the national railways for a certain period, in order to better complete the national transportation tasks and capital construction tasks. This is entirely correct and timely. Five months have passed since the introduction of this policy. All railways in the country have, without exception, been mobilized and deployed, formulated plans to learn the twelve basic experiences of the China Changchun Railway, and have begun to implement this plan, achieving great results.

However, it must be pointed out that some units have verbally accepted this policy and also called for "learning from the China Changchun Railway"; but in action, the leaders of these units have failed to lead by example and learn well. Why is this the case? The reason is that some leading cadres have not really figured out two questions in their minds: what to learn and how to learn. We must solve these two problems in a timely manner.

First, what to learn? Some comrades believe: "In the practice of learning, we do not know what is good to learn, and we do not know what the main characteristics of the China Changchun Railway are."

What exactly are the characteristics of the China Changchun Railway?

We should know that the China Changchun Railway has a complete set of mature and advanced experience in leadership style, planning management, economic accounting, technical management, and working methods. For example, in deploying and implementing the production and financial plan assigned by the state, there is a complete set of plans and methods that not only grasp the key points but also take care of the overall situation. At the beginning, the China Changchun Railway compiled its own comprehensive production and financial plan for the first time in the history of Chinese railways, as the criterion for all work. In order to realize this complete plan, which includes both production tasks and financial tasks, the management system thoroughly implemented planned management and technical management, implemented a strict economic accounting system, and executed production discipline and financial discipline; in terms of working methods, it widely mobilized the masses, discussed the production and financial plan, formulated a technical organization measures plan, signed collective contracts, purposefully promoted advanced Soviet working methods, launched a sustained patriotic labor competition among employees, and regarded regularly improving the business knowledge and technical proficiency of employees, and regularly caring for and improving the material and cultural life of employees as basic tasks; in terms of business technology, it regularly paid attention to improving the maintenance of fixed assets and the utilization of locomotives and vehicles; in terms of organizational structure, it established a complete organization, strict staffing, and clear responsibilities.

Whether it is between business and technical departments, economic departments, and all other departments, whether it is between administrative and political organs, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League, whether it is between leading organs and subordinate organs, leading personnel and subordinate personnel, and between management personnel, technical personnel, and workers, all work together and each play an active role to jointly fight for the realization of the production and financial plan. That is to say, under a general task, various organizations, systems, work, and practices are organically combined, and the railway is truly regarded as a complete engine, all striving towards a common goal from different aspects. But many of our railways are the opposite. Generally speaking, organizations, systems, technical measures, and working methods are always developing independently, uncoordinated, incompatible, and mutually restrictive. Each measure itself always grasps this point and forgets that point; or attaches importance to this point and despises that point; or does this point well and damages that point. For example, after signing collective contracts, the administrative side of a few units only talks about production, and the trade union side only wants welfare; after launching a labor competition, a few units forget about safe production and abandon technical management. Judging from the implementation of the three main tasks of the railway in the second half of this year, this is also the case. The three main tasks of the railway in the second half of this year are: learning from the China Changchun Railway, strengthening planned management, and implementing the campaign to increase production and practice thrift. These three tasks are unified and inseparable. However, a few units, in the movement to increase production and practice thrift, forgot about planned management and squeezed out (or unconsciously squeezed out) the task of "learning from the China Changchun Railway." The experience of the China Changchun Railway in coordinated action and mutual cooperation is essential for a comprehensive and complex enterprise like the railway.

The experience of the China Changchun Railway also shows that whatever work is done, it is carried out from beginning to end. All plans that have been approved, systems that have been determined, work that has been started, methods that have been promoted, etc., always break through all difficulties and obstacles and are implemented step by step and methodically. This spirit permeates all the measures mentioned above. The reason lies in learning and applying the working style of Lenin and Stalin, closely relying on all employees and absorbing them into production management; and grasping the inspection of the implementation of all resolutions, orders, instructions, etc., not only by general personnel carrying out regular inspection work, but also by senior leaders carrying out organized regular or irregular inspection work. The inspection is concrete, strict, and truly provides subordinates with all kinds of patient help and pertinent guidance. Many of our railways are the opposite. When doing work, we always drag our feet, everything is incomplete, and there is no end to the beginning. From the formal establishment of the China Changchun Railway on May 1, 1950, to the formal handover on December 31, 1952, the number of people sent by various railway bureaus in the country to study at the China Changchun Railway was not small, and they also learned some experience; but in applying these experiences, most of them were lively for a while, and then cooled down. For example, while formulating production and financial plans and technical organization measures plans, many units use "special events" as an excuse to change and destroy this plan at any time. When a few units hold employee representative congresses and the administrative heads and trade union chairmen formally sign collective contracts, it actually becomes the time when the collective contracts are "completed," that is, after signing collective contracts, they rarely continue to seriously inquire about them. The work of promoting advanced experience cannot be sustained. Li Xikui's shunting method only has "gravity shunting" left. Some comrades said: "Advanced working methods have returned to the Northeast." This situation of having a beginning but no end is particularly evident in the implementation of the policy of "learning from the China Changchun Railway" by individual railway bureaus in the past few months. Although they called for "learning from the China Changchun Railway" and formulated learning plans, they rarely inspected them, or only made formal inspections. The leaders of individual railway bureaus believed that they had completed the task of "learning from the China Changchun Railway" after "calling for" and "formulating learning plans," and then turned to handling daily trivial matters.

The reason why the experience of the China Changchun Railway is valuable is mainly because the entire experience is permeated with socialist ideology, which is a complete socialist ideology that integrates political quality, technical cultivation, and economic knowledge. This idea was once embodied in more than a thousand Soviet experts on the China Changchun Railway, and guided all Chinese comrades on the China Changchun Railway, becoming the basic spirit and essence of the China Changchun Railway's experience. We have not yet truly understood this spirit and essence. This is the key point that we lack very much and need to learn effectively.

Second, how to learn? Some comrades believe that we have sent many people to the China Changchun Railway to study in the past, and we have also listened to Soviet experts explain technical and economic theories and advanced working methods, and we have also interned in grassroots production units, but we have not learned well. How do we learn now? Especially for leading cadres, who have a lot of work and are busy, how do we learn?

First of all, we should check the learning methods of the past. There were two basic shortcomings in the past learning. One shortcoming is learning in isolation. The railway is a highly centralized enterprise, and everyone must learn together from top to bottom. But in practice, when learning from the experience of the China Changchun Railway, the railway bureau learned, but the Ministry of Railways did not learn or learned less; the production units and production personnel learned, but the leading organs and leading personnel did not learn or learned less; as a result, the railway bureaus adopted the experience of the China Changchun Railway, showing a phenomenon of top-down resistance and inability to implement it. Therefore, in the future, everyone must learn together from top to bottom. The railway is a unified engine, and everyone must learn together from left to right. But in reality, this business department learned, but that business department did not learn or learned less; the business department learned, but the economic department did not learn or learned less, which resulted in an incompatible situation, making the experience of the China Changchun Railway degenerate. Therefore, in the future, everyone must learn the experience of the China Changchun Railway together from top to bottom and from left to right. Another shortcoming is learning formally. Only learning the surface structure, not learning the spirit and essence; or, only learning some concepts and theories, but not understanding the specific and vivid practices, not understanding the changes of these practices at different times, places, and conditions, not understanding the laws of development of various experiences, so after learning, it does not work and cannot guide practice. Such learning methods must be corrected.

Secondly, we must learn the experience of the China Changchun Railway in all aspects, such as leadership style, management system, technical measures, and working methods. At the same time, we must also learn business technology knowledge and economic knowledge. That is to say, only by learning the complete set of skills for managing socialist enterprises can we use advanced ideas and advanced technology to guide railway work. Any empty slogans, or only being satisfied with general theoretical learning, are futile. Therefore, we must learn specifically, and we must learn as Comrade Stalin taught: "Since you are a factory manager, you must interfere in all affairs, you must be familiar with everything and do not ignore anything, you must study, and study again. Bolsheviks should be proficient in technology. It is already time for the Bolsheviks themselves to become experts." (Questions of Leninism)

Thirdly, in the process of learning, we should not regard the experience of the China Changchun Railway as a dead idol that will no longer develop, but must regard it as a living example. Because the experience of the China Changchun Railway was generated in the two years and eight months of the China Changchun Railway. The railway is continuously developing, and the experience of the China Changchun Railway will inevitably continue to develop under new circumstances. Therefore, if some specific organizations, systems, and regulations originally implemented on the China Changchun Railway do need to be added, subtracted, and adjusted due to the development of the situation, then they should be adjusted and enriched very carefully. This responsibility should first be borne by the direct successor bureau of the advanced experience of the China Changchun Railway—the Harbin Railway Bureau—and the Ministry of Railways. Because we are not empiricists or dogmatists, but realistic revolutionary realists.

This is the basic method and direction that railway employees across the country, especially leading cadres, must master when learning and promoting the advanced experience of the China Changchun Railway.

We must recognize that the process of implementing the policy of learning from the experience of the China Changchun Railway is essentially a process of struggle between socialist management ideology and capitalist management ideology. Leading cadres of railways across the country should lead this struggle by setting an example and improve our railway work a step further.

    认真贯彻“学习苏联、推广中长铁路经验”的方针
    中央人民政府铁道部部长　滕代远
    在我们祖国新的历史时期——实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义的时期中，摆在全国铁路员工面前的任务，就是为国家工业化和国防现代化服务，最大限度地满足国家计划经济建设以及人民在生产上和生活上对铁路运输日益增长的要求。为此，就必须搞好基本建设，并进一步发挥现有铁路的潜在力量，提高运输能力，降低运输成本，为国家建设积累更多资金。为此，就必须学习苏联铁路的先进经验和先进方法，中长铁路的经验是苏联经验和中国具体情况相结合的产物，在中苏合办的三十二个月当中，它曾以自己突出的效率高、成本低、利润大的模范行动，成为全国铁路的一面前进的旗帜和榜样。根据今年十个月的情况，它的货物发送吨数，上缴利润等比例数仍在继续上涨。中长铁路的先进经验，可以适用于全国铁路。
    中央人民政府铁道部在今年六月确定了学习和推广中长铁路经验是全国铁路在一定时期内的方针，以便很好地完成国家运输任务和基本建设任务。这是完全正确的和切合时宜的。这一方针的提出，到现在已经五个月了。全国铁路已经无例外地进行了动员和布置，制订了学习中长路十二条基本经验的计划，并开始执行了这一计划，获得了很大的效果。
    但必须指出：目前还有一部分单位在口头上接受了这一方针，也号召了“学习中长”；但在行动上，这些单位的领导人员却未能以身作则，很好地学习。为什么会这样呢？原因就是在一部分领导干部的思想中，并没有真正地想通两个问题：学什么和怎么学。我们必须及时地解决这两个问题。
    第一，学什么？有些同志认为：“我们在学习的实践中，不知道究竟学什么好，不知道中长路的主要特点是什么。”
    中长路的特点究竟是什么呢？
    我们应该知道：中长路无论在领导作风、计划管理、经济核算、技术管理和工作方法上，都有一套完整的成熟的先进经验。比如：在布置和执行国家交给的生产财务计划上，就有一套完整的计划和办法，不但抓住重点，而且照顾全面。中长路一开始就在中国铁路史上，第一次编制了自己的综合性的生产财务计划，作为一切工作的准则。为实现这一包括生产任务和财务任务两个方面的完整计划，在管理制度上，彻底推行了计划管理和技术管理，实行了严格的经济核算制，执行了生产纪律和财务纪律；在工作方法上，广泛发动群众，讨论生产财务计划，拟订了技术组织措施计划，签订了集体合同，有目的地推行了苏联先进工作方法，发动广大员工展开了持久的爱国主义劳动竞赛，并将经常提高员工的业务知识和技术熟练程度，经常关心和提高员工的物质文化生活，作为基本的任务；在业务技术上，经常地注意改善固定资产的维修和机车车辆的运用；在组织机构上，建立了完整的组织、严格的定员和明确的职责。
    中长路不论是业务技术部门、经济部门和其他一切部门之间，不论是行政和政治机关、工会、青年团之间，不论是领导机关和被领导机关、领导人员和被领导人员以及管理人员、技术人员和工人之间，都同心协力、各自发挥积极作用，来共同为生产财务计划的实现而斗争。这就是说，在一个总的任务下，各种组织、制度、工作和做法都是有机地结合起来的，都是真正将铁路作为一个完整的联动机来看待的，都是从不同方面向共同目标努力的。但我们很多铁路则相反。一般说来，组织、制度、技术措施和工作方法等，总是各自发展、互不配合、格格不入、互相牵制的。每一措施本身，也总是抓住了这点，忘掉了那点；或重视了这点，轻视了那点；或搞好了这点，损坏了那点。比如，签订了集体合同，少数单位的行政方面就只谈生产，工会方面就只要福利；展开了劳动竞赛，少数单位就忘掉了安全生产，丢掉了技术管理。从执行今年铁路下半年三个主要任务的情况看来，也是如此。今年铁路下半年三个主要任务是：学习中长经验，加强计划管理和贯彻增产节约。这三个任务是统一而不可分离的。但有少数单位，在增产节约运动中，忘记了计划管理，挤掉（或不自觉地挤掉）了“学习中长”的任务。中长路的协同动作、互相配合的经验，对铁路这样一个综合性的复杂的企业来说，是必须学习的。
    中长路经验还表现了：无论做什么工作，都是有始有终贯彻到底的。凡是批准了的计划，确定了的制度，开始了的工作，推行了的方法等等，总是打破一切困难和阻力，有步骤、有方法地贯彻到底的。上面所指出的各种措施，无一不渗透着这一精神。其原因就在于学习和运用了列宁斯大林工作作风，紧紧依靠全体员工并吸收他们参加生产管理；并抓紧了对一切决议、命令、指示等执行情况的检查，不仅由一般人员进行经常的检查工作，而且由高级领导人员进行有组织的定期的或不定期的检查工作。检查是具体的，严格的，是确实给予下级以各种耐心的帮助和切中要害的指导的。我们很多铁路则相反。在做工作时，处处拖尾巴，事事不彻底，有始无终。从中长路在一九五○年五月一日正式成立起，到一九五二年十二月三十一日正式办理移交止，全国各铁路局派到中长路去学习的人，并不很少，也学到一些经验；但在运用这些经验上，多半是热闹一阵，就冷却了。比如：在制订了生产财务计划和技术组织措施计划的同时，不少单位就每时每刻地以“特殊事件”为藉口来改变和破坏这一计划。少数单位在召开职工代表大会由行政首长和工会主席正式签订集体合同的时候，实际上也就成了集体合同“完成”的时候，就是说，签订集体合同之后，很少继续认真地过问。推广先进经验工作不能坚持下去。李锡奎调车法只剩了个“溜放”。有些同志说：“先进工作方法返回东北去了。”这种有头无尾的情况，在个别铁路局几个月来执行“学习中长”这一方针中，表现得特别明显。他们虽然号召了“学习中长”，制发了学习计划，但很少检查，或仅作形式上的检查，个别铁路局领导人员在“号召”和“制订学习计划”后，就认为完成了“学习中长”的任务，就转而处理日常的琐事去了。
    中长路经验之所以可贵，主要是因为在全部经验中贯串了社会主义思想，这就是政治品质、技术修养和经济知识融合为一体的完整的社会主义思想。这一思想曾经在中长路一千多个苏联专家身上体现出来，而指引着中长路的全体中国同志，成了中长路经验的基本精神和实质。我们还没有真正体会这个精神和实质。这就是我们所十分缺乏的而又需要切实学习的关键所在。
    第二，如何学？有些同志认为：过去我们已经派了很多人去中长路学过了，也专门听了苏联专家讲解技术经济理论和先进工作方法，也曾经到基层生产单位实习过了，但还没有学好。现在又怎样学习呢？特别是领导干部，工作又多，又忙，怎样学习呢？
    首先，应该检查一下过去学习的方法。过去学习中曾经存在过两个基本的缺点。一个缺点是孤立地学。铁路是一个有高度集中性的企业，必须上下一起学。但在实际上学习中长路经验时，铁路局学，铁道部不学或学得少；生产单位和生产人员学，领导机关和领导人员不学或学得少；以致各铁路局采用中长铁路经验，表现了上下抵触、不能贯彻的现象。因之，今后必须上下一起学。铁路又是一个统一的联动机，必须左右一起学。但在实际上，这个业务部门学了，那个业务部门不学或学得少；业务部门学，而经济部门不学或学得少，这样就发生了格格不入的状况，使得中长铁路经验变了质。因之，今后必须上下左右一起来学习中长铁路经验。另一个缺点是形式地学。只学表面结构，不学精神和实质；或者，只学到一些概念和理论，而不了解具体的生动的做法，不了解这些做法在不同的时间，地点和条件下的变化，不了解各种经验的发展规律，因而学了之后，不起作用，不能指导实际。这样的学法都是必须纠正的。
    其次，必须学会中长路的领导作风，管理制度、技术措施和工作方法等各个方面的经验，同时，还必须学会业务技术知识和经济知识。这就是说，只有学会了管理社会主义企业的全套本领，才能以先进的思想和先进的技术，来指导铁路工作。任何空喊口号，或只满足于一般的理论的学习，都是徒劳无益的。因此就要具体地学习，要像斯大林同志所教导过的那样学习：“你既是个工厂经理，就得干预一切事务，就要熟悉一切而连什么也不要忽略过去，就得学习，再三学习。布尔什维克应当精通技术。已经是布尔什维克自己成为专门家的时候了。”（列宁主义问题）
    再次，在学习过程中，不应该把中长路经验看作是死的，再也不会发展了的偶像，而必须看做是活的榜样。因为中长路经验是在中长路二年零八个月中间产生的经验。铁路是继续不断发展的，中长路经验在新的情况下也必然是继续不断发展的。因之，原来在中长路实行过的若干具体的组织、制度和规定，如果确实因为情况发展需要增减和调整的，那就应该十分谨慎地加以调整和充实。这一责任首先应该由中长路先进经验的直接继承局——哈尔滨铁路局和中央铁道部担负起来。因为我们不是经验主义者或教条主义者，而是实事求是的革命现实主义者。
    这就是全国铁路员工，尤其是领导干部学习和推广中长路先进经验时必须掌握的基本方法和方向。
    必须认识：贯彻学习中长铁路经验的方针的过程，实质上就是社会主义经营管理思想和资本主义经营管理思想的斗争过程。全国铁路领导干部更应该以身作则地领导这一斗争，将我们的铁路工作提高一步。
