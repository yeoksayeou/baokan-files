Touching Ancient Paintings
——After Viewing the Painting Gallery of the Palace Museum By Wang Chaowen

The plunder, theft, and destruction by imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries caused incalculable losses to the rich collection of Chinese paintings. Thanks to the efforts of the comrades in cultural relics management, the Palace Museum can now exhibit more than 500 paintings from the Sui to the Qing dynasties on an unprecedented scale. Although not every piece can be considered outstanding, many are precious works that have been fortunately preserved from disaster and have never had the opportunity to be seen by the people. New China's painters and other artists, in order to strengthen the connection between art and the people, inherit and develop the national style of art, and create new art with strong artistic qualities that the people love, will treat these precious and beautiful classical paintings as objects of serious study.

The "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" (Song Dynasty, Zhang Zeduan), which vividly and methodically records the lively life scenes; the "Herding Horses" (Song Dynasty, Li Gonglin), which centrally depicts the various postures of nearly two thousand horses; the "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" (Song Dynasty, Wang Ximeng), which meticulously and comprehensively depicts the magnificence and beauty of the motherland's mountains and rivers; the "Rivers and Mountains in Autumn Colors" (Song Dynasty, Zhao Boju), with its rigorous structure, clear and bright scenery, and ability to evoke the viewer's desire to travel; the "The Night Revels of Han Xizai" (attributed to Five Dynasties, Gu Hongzhong), with its distinct character and identity of the figures, and clever structure and expression; the "Literary Gathering" (Tang Dynasty, Han Huang), which naturally and unpretentiously depicts the demeanor of scholars contemplating ideas; and the rare "Spring Outing" by Zhan Ziqian of the Sui Dynasty, the "Precious Birds" attributed to Huang Quan of the Five Dynasties, the Song Dynasty copy of Gu Kaizhi's "Nymph of the Luo River," as well as other works with unique qualities, in terms of conception, layout, brushwork and coloring, the excellence of wisdom and skill in expressing themes, the inheritance and development of styles... will be deeply studied by specialists to make more incisive elucidations that are conducive to understanding the realistic tradition. I myself mainly recorded some feelings from the pre-exhibition viewing regarding how some genre paintings of the Song Dynasty cleverly handled their subjects.

Whether a painting is touching depends not on the simplicity or complexity of the brushwork, nor on the size of the scale, but on whether the image is real and vivid. The touching "Barge Descending the Gorges," "Knight Returning from the Hunt," "Returning Herds" (all Song Dynasty, unsigned), as well as other genre paintings by Song artists, although only depicting fragments or parts of human life and nature, are not incomplete fragments lacking integrity and independence. Because their subjects are the most representative, the most wonderful, the most touching, and the most suitable for the genre of painting, the limited screen can contain a relatively broad and profound meaning. According to customary saying, the good thing about these works is that "the words have an end, but the meaning is infinite." Precisely because its meaning is not narrow and superficial, these screens that are easy to understand at first glance and are not surprising at first sight make people feel more and more reluctant to leave and can evoke certain associations and imaginations. In fact, the materials of these works are ordinary, and their subtleties are fleeting and easily overlooked. Due to the sensitivity of the painters, they have been captured; due to the wisdom of the painters, they have cleverly formed touching images, forming a unique realm. These real and vivid images not only explain the state and nature of objective things, but also overflow with the painter's deep love, not a cold record of phenomena.

Boating on a narrow, rapid beach is the plot of "Barge Descending the Gorges". What first catches the eye are the boatmen on that boat that is still on the beach, only showing the bow – laborers who live on the river year after year and fight with death. They are poling, trying their best to resist the ruthless rocks and rapids, avoiding the misfortune of capsizing. Another boat has already crossed the dangerous shoal and turned a corner. The boatmen, who dare not relax, are using oars to keep the boat sailing safely on the raging waves. Today, this small ancient picture can make people who watch the painting – especially those with experience of river and sea life – temporarily forget that they are watching a painting, and they cannot help but feel nervous for the boatmen's tension and happy for the boatmen's joy. It can evoke memories of river and sea life, and it can make people think of how to fight danger and difficulties. This is a work that praises the working people, it praises the strength and will of the working people to overcome natural dangers. Although it is only a genre painting, it is by no means a flat genre painting that records phenomena. This work, which specifically describes the struggle between boatmen and nature, focusing on the power of people, can be encouraged, and the viewers are by no means limited to boatmen. How should we treat life and what is the meaning of life, it is expressed very concretely and very "reasonable". The tone of this work is very clear: if it is compared with "Willow Pavilion with Sails," which also paints boats, not only can one clearly see that the two have completely different tones, but one can also see that the authors have completely different emotional states. The latter's boat, set off by green willows, ripples, flying birds, and leisurely tourists, is riding the wind and proceeding leisurely on the spring water, which is the tone of a lyric poem. And "Barge Descending the Gorges" is the tone of a marching song with a high spirit of struggle. These two indistinguishable tones obey the specific objective reality, and at the same time reveal different intentions and emotions of different authors. Regardless of whether the subject of "Barge Descending the Gorges" comes from imagination or from the impression of life, when the author handles the subject, why emphasize the thrilling nature of river life and constitute the pattern of a marching song? It should be said that, in addition to the author's loyalty to reality, it is also because he does not take a cold, bystander attitude towards life.

"Knight Returning from the Hunt" depicts the knight and his friend – the horse. The horse, ending its hard running, still carrying the saddle and the prey, hangs its head, its eyes showing fatigue, and is panting. The knight, closing one eye, concentrates on examining the arrow that may have just been pulled out of the prey. By cleverly organizing these meaningful details, it prominently expresses the special demeanor of people and horses who have just returned from the hunt. The realm of the work is fresh and not "generalized." Although only depicting a fragment of the hunter's action, due to the contrasting description of the knight's action of inspecting his weapon and the tired horse that has not yet unloaded its prey, it makes people feel that the hunter, who is enthusiastic about his weapon, will go hunting again. This scene is not an ordinary and vague – the knight has returned – explanation, but an art that can evoke associations related to the theme. The painter first obeys the law that plastic art can only directly depict fragments and parts of actions to imply others, thereby borrowing this limited part and fragment to foreshadow other plots that do not appear on the screen – another hunt. In this way, the realm of the work is not superficial and narrow. Another good thing about this work is that the characters are depicted accurately and vividly, and this method of depiction is not boring and not ordinary. We know that a person's quality is also expressed in daily actions, and small events and small actions should also arouse the painter's concern. The qualities of heroic anti-Japanese guerrillas are not only evident on the battlefield of hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, but when they sleep with their rifles in their arms, can't it be said to be a concrete manifestation of the qualities of a fighter? Similarly, in "Knight Returning from the Hunt," which praises the knight's energy and love for his work, the emphasized depiction of the knight's demeanor of inspecting the arrow shaft is a creative expression in terms of praising the knight's theme. Whether it is a foreshadowing of future actions or a depiction of the character of the person, this work has a good thing that viewers should be grateful for: it leaves viewers with room to develop associations and imagination, and allows viewers to supplement it with their own life experience. Specifically describing the knight's demeanor of concentrating on examining the arrow shaft, thereby triggering viewers to develop associations and imagination, is a good work that obeys the limitations of plastic art and is not restricted by modeling. This is a good work that gives full play to the strengths of all art – concretely but not vaguely praising positive characters. This way of handling the subject is clever and unconventional. For some authors who are accustomed to focusing only on large scenes but cannot accurately express the spirit of the characters, it has particularly valuable significance for reference.

"Returning Herds," in terms of material, actually depicts nothing more than production tools that people have been willing to paint in all dynasties, and animals that people love – cattle. However, it is not easy to encounter in general paintings of cattle that can accurately and vividly depict the demeanor of cattle under special circumstances, constituting a special realm. The cow, carrying the herd boy, has waded through the shallow water and is trying hard to climb ashore, but seems to want to turn around to take care of the calf that has not yet caught up. The calf, this naive and inexperienced young one, stretches its neck and stands on the opposite bank, looking at its mother, wanting to move forward but not yet advancing. It is crying, as if asking for help. To describe the cow in this way is not a general description of the cow. Viewers can appreciate it as a cow, but it is not just a simple appreciation of a general cow. This depiction of the naivety of the young and the parent-child relationship can evoke associations of human parent-child relationships and love for the young. Because the painter loves the object he describes and deeply feels the cuteness of the cow, when he shapes the image, he clearly focuses on the calf's demeanor of watching, thereby avoiding the superficial method of illustrating objects, and vividly expressing the cow's demeanor and emotion under this special state. In the handling of the subject matter, this work shows the excellence of the painter's skills. Viewers with creative experience know that it is not difficult to accurately draw the shape of the cow according to the knowledge of anatomy; it is not difficult to draw the three-dimensional sense of the cow according to the knowledge of light and shade; it is not difficult to draw the distance between the cow and the cow according to the knowledge of perspective. The difficulty lies in the creativity of the conception, the difficulty lies in the special demeanor of the cow being able to form a charming and durable realm, the difficulty lies in avoiding the cow's actions without a clear motive, and the difficulty lies in making the image not become a simple sketch of the cow's shape. "Returning Herds," like "Autumn Forest Releasing Calves" and "Grazing" (Mao Yi), are all authors who have special feelings for the life of cattle and have made original treatment of the special performance of cattle under certain circumstances. In "Autumn Forest Releasing Calves," the herd boy is preoccupied with fishing for shrimps in the stream, while the cow is always tied to a fixed place under the forest where the leaves are rustling, and it impatiently tightens the rope worn on its nose, seemingly protesting to its little master. This touching plot, this description of the cow that is not only true to the external form but also has interest, is it only because of the painter's skillful and accurate brushwork? I think: At present, many creations seem to be not good at expressing the spiritual outlook of people. Although the theme has positive significance, it is not easy for viewers to sincerely accept the propaganda of the work. Therefore, how to appropriately select and organize meaningful details, so that the modeling of the work and the non-artistic specimen model are divided into clear boundaries, "Returning Herds" these works should be very enlightening.

This short article cannot introduce many good works in detail. However, other genre paintings of the Song Dynasty that are equally interesting, poetic, and have realms, such as "Departing Soldiers at Dawn", are always unforgettable when I write. Those works that seem unremarkable at the pre-exhibition viewing but become more and more flavorful as you think about them and can create a deep impression, in the sense of how to cleverly introduce what the author considers the essence to the viewers, whether depicting figures, flowers and birds, landscapes, or even gods, are all very lovable. In "Departing Soldiers at Dawn," the luggage and horses have been prepared long ago, and the traveler who is the protagonist is still dozing on the table. Anyone who has had a certain experience of leaving home for a long trip will not be without feeling in front of such a work, right? There are many good works in the painting gallery: unrestrained wild ducks, without the threat of fierce eagles and falcons, are lively chasing each other in the quiet stream (Ma Yuan's "Plum Stone Stream Ducks"); sheep that seem to be really fighting, but are actually playing, are sheep, but also look like naughty children ("Four Sheep"); a clever bird, quickly turning its head back, staring full of murderous intent at a small bee that may not have felt the danger ("Sparse Lotus Sand Bird"). Are these depictions of animal life? Yes; but it is by no means a description of bland and trivial phenomena. If it is said that this is a small drama, it is not an exaggerated statement, right? Let's look again: it is raining and windy, and it seems that we can hear the sound and feel the coldness in "Returning Boats in Wind and Rain"; flowers surrounded by butterflies, facing the wind, and seemingly still carrying dew, containing silent life in "Begonia Butterfly"; the appropriate arrangement of the relationship between willow branches and flying birds, the sky appears very wide in "Autumn Willow Double Crow"; happy little fish, truly and untruly playing with algae leaves in "Fish Playing with Algae"; cleverly controlling the blank space of the screen, emphatically handling the distance between objects, the sense of movement is particularly strong in "Hunting"; by means of the gentle movement of the clothes and belts in the wind and the openness of the space, expressing the freely flying in "Fairy Riding a Luan";... what a varied, vast, and beautiful world these paintings unfold!

Only recording some genre paintings of the Song Dynasty, needless to say, it is not because only genre paintings of the Song Dynasty are poetic, have realms, and are good at handling subjects. The magnificent long scrolls like the "Rivers and Mountains in Autumn Colors" mentioned at the beginning of this article, not to mention other works from various eras, such as Tang Yin's "Wind Wood" of the Ming Dynasty, all have advantages that cannot be ignored. The theme of "Wind Wood" is to describe the grief of those who miss their parents, which coincides with the ancient saying "The tree wants to be quiet but the wind does not stop, the child wants to support but the parent does not wait." The grief of missing parents is described very naturally and sincerely. This work, which appropriately handles the relationship between people and the environment and the relationship between those present and those absent, is more interesting, more touching, and more can be called art than works that simply and plainly explain a certain phenomenon.

Today, as long as we do not treat these many creative works with a lack of creative "stir-frying old rice" attitude, we can definitely get help on how to handle the subject matter. Although they reflect the old living reality, and even some works do not necessarily have healthy emotions, and are not socialist realistic art, however, for us, it does not lose its important role worthy of reference. In order to form the originality of style, in order to accurately and touchingly reflect the new atmosphere and new moral qualities of New China, and in order to persuasively educate the people with correct and clear ideas, in addition to going deep into life and deeply studying the laws of life's development, we should repeatedly study these Chinese classical arts that are neither formulaic nor naturalistic. This is not only more beneficial to the development of national style, but also more effectively overcomes the shortcomings of formalism and naturalism in creation (and even in sketching).

    动人的古代绘画
    ——故宫博物院绘画馆观后  王朝闻
    帝国主义者、国民党反动派的掠夺、盗窃和破坏，使丰富的中国绘画蒙受了难以估计的损失。感谢文物管理工作同志的努力搜求，故宫博物院今天能以空前巨大的规模，展出了自隋至清的绘画五百多件。虽然不能以为其中每一件都是精彩的，却有不少是幸运地从灾难中保存下来、从来还不曾有机会和人民见面的珍品。新中国的画家和其他艺术家，为了加强艺术与人民的联系，继承和发扬艺术的民族风格，创造人民喜爱的艺术性较强的新艺术，将会把这些珍贵的、优美的古典绘画当作认真研究的对象。
    富于变化而有条理地记述着热闹的生活状况的“清明上河图”（宋·张择端），集中地描写了近两千匹马的各式各样姿态的“牧放图”（宋·李公麟），一笔不苟、综合地描写了祖国山河的壮阔和优美的“千里江山图”（宋·王希孟），结构严谨、景色明净、爽朗、能够唤起欣赏者的游兴的“江山秋色图”（宋·赵伯驹），人物的性格和身分鲜明、结构和表现方式巧妙的“韩熙载夜宴图”（传五代·顾闳中），自然地并不矫揉造作地描写了文人构思时的神态的“文苑图”（唐·韩滉），和难得的隋朝展子虔“游春图”，传五代黄筌的“珍禽图”，宋人摹顾恺之“洛神赋图”，以及其他各有独到之处的作品，在立意、布局、用笔和设色，表达主题的智慧和技巧的卓越性，风格的继承和发展……将得到专门家的深入研究，作出有利于认识现实主义传统的比较精辟的阐述。我自己，主要对于宋朝的一些小品画如何巧妙地处理题材的问题，记下一些预展参观时的感受。
    绘画是不是动人，不在笔墨的繁简，不在规模的大小，而在形象是不是真实和生动。动人的“巴船下峡图”，“骑士猎归图”，“归牧图”（皆宋人，无款），以及其他宋人的小品画，尽管只描写了人的生活和自然的片断或局部，可是，都并非缺乏完整性和独立性的残片。由于它的题材是最有代表意义最精彩最动人也最适合绘画的体裁的，有限的画面能够包含着比较广阔和深厚的意义。按照习惯的说法，这些作品的好处是“言有尽而意无穷”。正因为它的意义不是狭窄的和肤浅的，这些一看就能懂的初看并不惊人的画面，使人愈看愈感到不忍离开，能够引起一定的联想和想像。其实，这些作品的素材，是平常的，它那微妙之处，是稍纵即逝的，容易被人忽略的。由于画家的敏感，抓住了它；由于画家的智慧，巧妙地构成了动人的形象，形成了独特的境界。这些真实的生动的形象，不只说明客观事物的状况和性质，而且它们洋溢着画家深厚的爱，不是冷冰冰的现象记录。
    在狭窄的湍急的滩口上行船，是“巴船下峡图”的情节。首先引人注目的，是那只还在滩上、只露出船的头部的船只上的那些船夫——成年累月生活在江上和死亡搏斗的劳动者。他们正在使篙，尽力和无情的岩石、激流相抗拒，避免遭到覆船的厄运。另一只船已经渡过险滩，转了弯。不敢松懈的船夫，用桨，使船只能在狂涛上平安地驰行。这一幅古代的小小的图画，在今天，它能够使观赏画的人——特别是有江海生活经验的人，暂时忘记自己是在看画，不禁为船夫的紧张而紧张，为船夫的愉快而愉快。它可以引起江海生涯的回忆，它可以使人联想到如何跟危险、困难作斗争。这是歌颂劳动人民的作品，它歌颂劳动人民战胜天险的力量和意志。它虽然只是一种小品画，却决不是一种平板地记录现象的平凡的风俗画。具体描写船夫和自然作斗争、着重描写了人的力量的这一作品，能够受到鼓舞的观赏者，决不局限于船夫。应该怎样对待生活和什么是生活的意义，它是表现得很具体很有
  “理由”的。这一作品的情调很鲜明：如果把它和同是画船的“柳阁风帆图”相比较，不仅分明看得出两者绝不相同的情调，而且也看得出作者绝不相同的情绪状态。后者的船，衬托着绿柳、微波、飞鸟和优闲的游人，乘着风，从容地在春水上行进，这是一种抒情诗的情调。而“巴船下峡图”，却是一种斗争情绪昂扬的进行曲的情调。这两种不能混淆的情调服从具体的客观实际，同时也流露着不同作者不同的意图和情绪。不问“巴船下峡图”的题材是来自想像还是来自生活的印象，当作者处理题材的时候，为什么强调表现江河生活的惊险，构成了进行曲的格调呢？应该说，这除了作者忠于实际之外，同时还因为他对于生活不是采取旁观者的冷淡的态度。
    “骑士猎归图”，画的是骑士和他的朋友——马。马，结束了辛劳的奔驰，还荷载着鞍子和猎获品，垂着头，眼光显出疲乏，正在喘息。骑士，闭着一只眼，聚精会神地检视那也许是刚从猎获品上拔下来的箭。巧妙地组织了这些有意义的细节，突出地表现了刚刚从猎场归来的人和马的那种特殊的神态，作品的境界是新鲜的不“一般化”的。尽管只描写了猎人行动的一个片段，由于对比地描写了骑士检视武器的动作和尚未卸下猎物的疲乏的马，使人感到热心对待自己的武器的猎人，将要再出猎。这一场面不是平凡的、空泛的——骑士回来了的——说明，而是能够唤起和主题有联系的联想的艺术。画家首先服从了造型艺术只能直接描写行动的片段和局部以暗示其他的法则，从而借这一有限的局部和片段，预示着没有出现在画面上的其他情节——再一次的出猎。这样，作品的境界就不肤浅、不狭窄。这一作品的另一好处，是人物性格描写得精确和鲜明，而且这种描写的方式很不枯燥很不平凡。我们知道：人的品质也表现在日常的行动上，细小的事件细小的行动也应该引起画家的关心。英雄的抗日的游击战士的品质，不只是在和敌人肉搏的战场上才显得出来，当他们抱着步枪睡觉的时候，也不能不说是战斗者的品质的一种具体表现吧？同样的：在赞扬骑士精力饱满和热爱他的工作的“骑士猎归图”，强调地描写着骑士检视箭杆的神态，就赞扬骑士的主题来看，这是一种有创造性的表现方式。不论是对于未来行动的预示，不论是对于人物性格的描写，这一作品有一种值得观赏者感激的好处：它给观赏者留下发挥联想和想像的余地，容许观赏者用他们自己的生活经验作补充。具体地描写骑士聚精会神地检视箭杆的神态，从而触发观赏者发挥联想和想像，这是服从造型艺术的限制而又不受造型的拘束的耐人寻味的好作品。这是发挥了一切艺术——具体地而不是空泛地歌颂正面人物——的特长的好作品。这种处理题材的方式是巧妙的，不落陈套的。对于某些习惯只从大场面着眼而又不能确切地表现人物的精神面貌的作者，特别具有值得借鉴的意义。
    “归牧图”，就素材而论，其实所画的不过是历代都有人愿画的生产工具、人们爱好的动物——牛。可是，能够这样确切地活生生地把特殊的状况之下的牛的神态描写出来，构成了特殊的境界，在一般画牛的作品中还不是容易碰见的。负荷着牧童的母牛，涉过了浅水，吃力地要爬上岸去，却又似乎要回头照顾那还没有跟上来的小牛。小牛，这一稚气的、生活经验还不丰富的幼小者，伸着脖子站在对岸，望着它的母亲，要前进又不曾前进。它在号叫，似乎是要求援助。这样来描写牛，不是一般的牛的描写。观赏者可以把它当成牛来观赏，又不只是单纯地观赏一般的牛。这种稚气的幼小者的神气和亲子关系的描写，能够唤起人的亲子关系的联想和对于幼小者的爱怜。由于画家挚爱他所描写的对象，深切地感到牛的可爱，当他塑造形象的时候，明确地以小牛观望的神态为重点，从而避免了肤浅的物象说明的画法，生动地表现这一特殊状态之下的牛的神态和情感。在题材的处理上，这一作品显示了画家的技巧的卓越。有创作经验的观赏者知道：要按照解剖学的知识，准确地画出牛的形体，不难；要按照明暗法的知识，画出牛的立体感，不难；要按照远近法的知识，画出牛与牛的距离，不难。难在构思的创造性，难在特殊的牛的神态能够构成魅人的耐看的境界，难在避免牛的行动没有明确动机，难在使形象不至于成为简单的牛的形体的写生。“归牧图”，如同“秋林放犊图”和“放牧图”（毛益）那样，都是对于牛的生活有特殊感受的作者，对于一定情势之下的牛的特殊的表现，作了别出心裁的处理。在“秋林放犊图”里，牧童自顾自地在溪水里捞鱼虾，而牛在落叶萧萧的林下，老是被拴在一个固定的地方，它不耐地绷紧了穿在鼻子上的绳子，似乎在向他的小主人抗议。这种动人的情节，这种不止于外形的逼真而是有情趣的牛的描写，何尝仅仅因为画家笔墨的熟练和准确？我以为：目前有好些创作显得不善于表现人的精神面貌，虽然主题具有积极意义，却不容易使观赏者由衷地接受作品的宣传。因而如何适当选择和组织有意义的细节，使作品的造形和不艺术的标本模型划分出分明的界限，“归牧图”这些作品，应该是很有启示作用的。
    这篇短文不能详细介绍许多好作品。然而同样是有情趣有诗意有境界的其他宋朝的小品画，例如“征人晓发图”等等，当我执笔的时候，总是难以忘却地出现在面前。在预展参观时看起来并不惊人却愈想愈感到有味而且能够造成深刻印象的那些作品，仅就怎样把作者认为精华的东西巧妙地介绍给观赏者这一意义而论，不论描写的是人物、花鸟、山水以至神仙，都是很逗人爱的。“征人晓发图”里，行李马匹早已准备好，作为主角的远行人，还伏在桌子上打瞌睡。只要有过一定的离家远行生活经历的人，在这样的作品之前，不至毫无感触吧？绘画馆的好作品是很多的：无拘束的野鸭，没有凶猛的鹰鹫的威胁，在清幽的溪涧活泼地追逐着（马远“梅石溪凫图”）；好像是真打，其实是闹着玩的羊，是羊，也很像顽皮的孩子（“四羊图”）；机灵的鸟，敏捷地回过头来，满含杀机地凝视着也许还没有感到危险的小蜂（“疏荷沙鸟图”）。这些，是动物生活的写照吗？是的；但决不是平淡无味的琐屑现象的写照。如果说这是小小的戏剧，不算是浮夸的说法吧？我们再看：天在下着雨，刮着风，似乎听得见声音和感觉得到冷意的“风雨归舟图”；蝴蝶围绕着的、临风的、似乎还带着露的鲜花，含着默默生命的“海棠风蝶图”；适当地安排了柳枝与飞鸟的关系，天空显得很宽阔的“秋柳双鸦图”；愉快的小鱼儿，当真又不当真地玩弄着藻叶的“群鱼戏藻图”；巧妙地支配着画面的空白，强调地处理了物与物的距离，运动感特别强烈的“射猎图”；借着轻柔的衣带临风的动势和空间的开阔，表现了自在地飞行的“仙女乘鸾图”；……这些画展开的世界多么富于变化，多么广阔，多么美好！
    只记述了一些宋朝的小品，不用说并不是以为只有宋朝的小品才是有诗意有境界和善于处理题材的。本文一开始就提到的“江山秋色图”那样宏伟的长卷等等不说了，其他各个时代的作品，例如明朝唐寅的“风木图”，都有不可忽视的好处。“风木图”的主题是描写思亲者的悲哀，与“树欲静而风不止，子欲养而亲不待”的古语相切合，思亲的悲哀描写得很自然很真挚。适当处理人与环境的关系和在场者与不在场的关系的这一作品，较之只是平板地说明某种现象的作品，更有情趣更动人更能称为艺术。
    今天，我们只要不是以缺乏创造性的“炒冷饭”的态度来对待这许多具有创造性的作品，一定可以得到怎样处理题材的帮助。尽管它们反映的是古老的生活实际，甚至有些作品的情感不一定健康，更不是社会主义现实主义的艺术，然而，对于我们，并不丧失其值得借鉴的重要作用。为了形成风格的独创性，为了新中国的新气象和新的道德品质得到确切的动人的反映，为了富于说服力地用正确的和明确的思想教育人民，除了深入生活和深入研究生活发展规律之外，应该反复研究这些不是公式化也不是自然主义的中国古典的艺术。这不仅更有益于民族气派的发扬，也更能有效地克服创作上
  （以至速写上）公式化和自然主义的毛病。
