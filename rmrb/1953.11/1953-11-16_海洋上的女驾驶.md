　　Female Driver on the Ocean
    By Our Reporter Lin Li

　　The young men on the "Tanggu No. 3" dredger invited me to visit their ship. They said that a female comrade had been added to the No. 3 ship and was learning how to operate the dredger. They also said that she was the first woman in New China to operate a ship on the ocean. They invited me to interview her.

　　I thought it made sense. In recent years, in the skies of the motherland, there have been female aviators flying airplanes; on the grasslands of North Manchuria, there have been female villagers driving tractors; on the trains running north and south across the motherland, there are also female drivers... Wherever there is life, there are almost traces of women. Only on the vast and boundless ocean has there never been news of women piloting ships. Therefore, I followed the young sailors Zhang Yuchun and He Yunting, and together we jumped into a sampan and headed to the Tanggu No. 3 dredger.

　　He Yunting was rowing the sampan, waving his long oar, while describing the background of the female driver. He said that the female driver came from the Huai River. Because the Huai River does not have "suction-type" dredgers, the huge dredging tasks are carried out using "grab-type" dredgers. The amount of mud dredged by that kind of ship in a day is not even equal to the efficiency of a "suction-type" dredger in one hour. And the cost is several times higher. For this reason, the Huai River Mechanical Dredging Engineering Team decided to add "suction-type" dredgers. But there were no drivers there, so eight comrades were sent here to learn. The female driver is one of these eight comrades.

　　While speaking, we arrived at the Tanggu No. 3 dredger. He Yunting led me to the bridge, pointed to the female comrade sitting in front of the cutter controller, and introduced:

　　"This is our female driver. The first one in New China!"

　　The female driver glanced at the visitor shyly, and then stared intently at operating her machine.

　　Her name is Pei Wenxian, and she is currently under eighteen years old. Thick eyebrows, big eyes, tall stature, and a rosy face. She is physically fit and full. She has the kind of lively, cheerful, frank, and straightforward personality that contemporary young people have, and also the shy smile of an average girl. The people on the ship always affectionately call her "Little Pei," as if they were calling their own sister.

　　Little Pei used to be an accountant in the Huai River Mechanical Dredging Engineering Team of the Huai River Management Committee. But she always felt that: it was a waste for a strong body like mine to stay in the office all day. She said: "I should go to a more difficult place, and the office should be given to those comrades who are physically weaker." So when she heard that the team was planning to send people to Tanggu New Port to learn dredging ship driving technology, she ran to the team leader:

　　"Team leader, are you sending women to learn at Tanggu New Port?"

　　"Maybe one." The team leader replied.

　　"As soon as I heard 'maybe'," Little Pei recalled her experience of asking to leave the office, and became so excited that she couldn't restrain herself and blurted out a whole bunch. "I immediately asked: which one are you sending? -- The team leader felt embarrassed and didn't speak for a long time. Because this was a personnel matter, how could he just say it casually before it was officially decided! Besides, he is the leader! But I didn't care about that and kept asking: 'Which one are you sending?' He had no choice but to say: 'It hasn't been decided yet!'

　　"I thought since it hasn't been decided, there is hope. So I said: 'Team leader, do you think it's okay for me to go?' I couldn't wait for an answer, and asked one question after another: 'Do you agree or not?' 'Say something!' 'Just say yes and it's done!'... The team leader just laughed and didn't speak. Because they had already planned to send someone named Xia, and I knew this.

　　"Two days later, I heard that the one named Xia was closely following the team leader; Lao Ju's wife wanted to go with Lao Ju; and a colleague of mine named Fan also signed up. -- In our unit, there were a total of seven female comrades, and four of them were competing to go -- this made me anxious. I couldn't sleep all day and night, counting those female comrades. They all graduated from high school, and I only finished the second year of junior high school, I don't have their high level of education. The one named Xia, Lao Ju's wife, are all technicians, their conditions are better than mine... Thinking, thinking, the more I thought about it, the more anxious I became, and the more anxious I became, the more I couldn't sleep. But on the other hand, none of them have my good physique, so I mustered up my courage and went to the team leader again... I pestered him like this for about ten days.

　　"One day, the team leader suddenly asked me: 'Little Pei, have you discussed with your family about going to New Port to study?' I said: 'Participating in the construction of the motherland is my own business, there is no need to discuss it with anyone.' The team leader also said: 'Life on the ocean is very hard!' I said: 'New China's women are not afraid of hardship.' The team leader said: 'Working on the ship is very difficult!' I said: 'I am not afraid of difficulties.' While I was saying this, I was secretly rejoicing. I guessed: it must have been decided that I was going, otherwise, why ask these things? So I turned around and asked the team leader: 'Team leader, has it been decided that I'm going?' The team leader said: 'There is a possibility.' I thought 'possibility' is still not reality; I'm still not at ease!

　　"Just in this anxious situation, people said that an old lady came from outside, wanting to find Pei Wenxian. I thought this was bad, it must be my mother who heard the news of me going to Tanggu New Port to study, and came to find me again..."

　　"What do you mean by 'came to find...again'?" I interrupted her and asked.

　　"Yes, it is 'came to find again'! Because she has come to find me more than once! -- The first time, I signed up to join the military cadre school, I applied for the air force! I was even admitted! It looked like I was going to Beijing and see Chairman Mao. But, my mother heard the news and rushed over from more than two hundred miles away, crying and making a fuss. Saying that she wouldn't let me go no matter what. At that time, I was not old enough to take the exam, and I overstated my age when I registered. Because I was tall and physically fit, the air force examiners didn't notice. My mother's fuss was bad, the air force personnel found out and said: 'You are not old enough and have not obtained family consent, go next time.' That's how I was put on hold -- if my mother hadn't come to find me, I would have flown into the sky a long time ago..." Saying this, a blush appeared on her originally rosy face, and she instinctively cupped her face with both hands, shyly lowered her head, and smiled.

　　"Was there a second time?" I asked.

　　"Yes, that was the second year, I signed up to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to go abroad! I was also all prepared, just waiting to leave. My mother ran over again. She also said: 'Your two older sisters joined the People's Liberation Army, I can't even touch one, I want to see them but I can't. You three sisters, and you are the youngest, you must stay with us.' In this way, people said that I was not old enough and did not get family consent, so I was left behind again. Otherwise, I would have been on the Korean front a long time ago...!" She shyly lowered her head again and didn't speak.

　　"Who exactly is that old lady!" I asked.

　　"That's my mother! Didn't I just tell you, as soon as I heard she was coming, I was really angry and resentful. I thought: this time it's over again! Earlier, she wouldn't let me fly into the sky; this time I'm going to go to the sea, how could she let me?" But this time she didn't cry or make a fuss, instead, she told me to study hard.

　　"How did that happen?" I asked curiously.

　　"She has also made progress! She also said, in the past my thinking was backward, can I still be backward now? However, this time she saw my older sister first. My older sister's team returned to Bengbu, my older sister loves me, and I also love my older sister. But this time my older sister was very serious. She said: 'Are you thinking of making learning to drive a ship your lifelong career? Have you thought it over?' I said: 'I've thought it over!' My older sister said again: 'If you want to go, you must be determined to learn it well; if you don't have the determination, then just don't go. You must know how difficult it is for the country to cultivate a talent. Are you determined?' My older sister's seriousness made me embarrassed instead. But I said: 'I am determined to learn it well, and I will never let down the country's cultivation.'"

　　海洋上的女驾驶
    本报记者  林里
    “塘沽三号”挖泥船上的年轻人，邀我到他们的船上去玩。他们说，三号船上添了一个女同志，在学习挖泥船的驾驶工作。还说，这是新中国妇女第一个到海洋上来驾船的。他们邀我去访问她。
    我一想也对。这几年来，祖国的天空上，有了女航空员开飞机；北满的草原上，有女庄员开拖拉机；奔驰在祖国南北的火车上，也有女司机……有生活的地方，几乎都有妇女的踪迹。仅只是在辽阔无垠的海洋上，还从来没听说过有妇女驾驶船只的消息。因此，我随着青年水手张玉春和何云廷，一起跳上舢舨，前往塘沽三号挖泥船。
    何云廷摇着舢舨，一边挥动着他的长橹，一边叙述着女驾驶的来历。他说，女驾驶是从淮河上来的。因为淮河那里没有“吸扬式”挖泥船，巨大的挖泥任务，是用“抓扬式”挖泥船进行的。那种船，一天的挖泥数量，还赶不上“吸扬式”挖泥船一个小时的效率。并且费用要高好几倍。因为这个缘故，淮河机械疏浚工程队，决定增添“吸扬式”挖泥船。但那里没有驾驶人员，就送来了八个同志，到这里学习。女驾驶就是这八个同志当中的一个。
    说话之间，我们到了塘沽三号挖泥船。何云廷把我领到驾驶台上，他指着坐在绞刀控制器前的女同志，介绍说：
    “这就是我们的女驾驶。新中国的第一名啊！”
    女驾驶不好意思地看了一眼来人，就目不转睛地操作起了她的机器。
    她叫裴文献，现在不满十八岁。浓眉，大眼，高高的个子，红红的脸。体格健美，又丰满。她有当代年轻人所特有的那种活泼、愉快、坦率、爽朗的性格，又有一般少女那种容易害羞的笑容。船上的人，总像叫唤自己的妹妹一样，亲切地叫她“小裴”。
    小裴，原来在治淮委员会的淮河机械疏浚工程队当会计。可是她总觉着：像我这样强壮的身体，整天呆在办公室里是一种浪费。她说：“我应该到更艰苦的地方去，办公室应该让给那些体格较弱的同志。”所以当她听说队里打算派人到塘沽新港来学挖泥船驾驶技术的时候，她就跑到队长那里：
    “队长，到塘沽新港学习，去不去女的？”
    “可能去一个。”队长回答说。
    “我一听说可能。”小裴回忆起她要求离开办公室的经过，兴奋得无论如何收缩不住，一气讲了这么一大堆。“我立刻追问了一句：叫那一个去？——队长难为情起来，半天不说话。因为这是人事问题，没有正式决定以前，他怎么能随便说哩！再说，他是领导人啊！可是，我不管这些，一直追问：‘叫那一个去？’他没办法，才说了声：‘还没有决定哩！’
    “我想既然没有决定，就有希望。便说：‘队长，你看我去行不行？’我等不及回答，一句接着一句地问：‘你到底同意不同意？’‘你说话呀！’‘你说个同意不就得了吗？’……队长光笑，不说话。因为他们早就打算叫一个姓夏的去，这个情况我是知道的。
    “过了两天，听说姓夏的紧追着队长；老巨的爱人，要跟老巨一块去；和我一起工作的一位姓范的，也报了名。——我们那个单位，统共七个女同志，就有四个人争着要去——这可把我急死了。我成天成夜地睡不着，数算着那几个女同志。人家都是高中毕业，我只念了二年初中，我没有人家的文化水平高。姓夏的，老巨的爱人，都是技术员，条件比我好……想着，想着，越想越着急，越着急就越睡不着。可是翻过来一想，她们谁也没有我的体格好，我就鼓了鼓勇气，又找队长去了……。这样缠磨了总有十来天。
    “有一天，队长忽然问我说：‘小裴，你去新港学习，跟家里商量了没有？’我说：‘参加祖国建设，是自己的事，用不着给谁商量。’队长又说：‘海洋生活可苦得很呀！’我说：‘新中国妇女，不怕艰苦。’队长说：‘船上工作可困难得很呀！’我说：‘我不怕困难。’我一边说，一边暗自喜着。我猜想：准是决定叫我去了，要不然，何必问这些呢？于是我反过来问队长：‘队长，是不是决定叫我去？’队长说：‘有这个可能。’我想‘可能’总还不是现实呵；还是不放心！
    “正在这种心急火燎的劲上，人们说外面来了一个老太太，要找裴文献。我想这可坏了，准是妈妈听说我到塘沽新港学习的消息，又来找我了……”
    “你说‘又来找……’是什么意思？”我打断她的话插嘴问着。
    “是啊，是‘又来找’啊！因为他不止一次来找了啊！——第一次，我报名参加军事干部学校，我考的是空军啊！还被录取了呢！眼看就要上北京、见毛主席去了。可是，母亲听到消息，从二百多里地以外赶了来，又是哭，又是闹。说什么也不放我走。那时我还不够应考年龄，报名时虚报了岁数。因为我长的高，体格好，空军验考人员没有看出来。母亲这一闹不要紧，空军人员知道了，说：‘你年龄不够，又没有得到家庭同意，下次去好了。’我就这样被搁下来了——要不是母亲来找，我早飞到天上去了……”说到这里，她那本来红润的脸上，泛起一层红晕，两手本能地把脸一捧，含羞地低下头，笑了。
    “还有第二次吗？”我问。
    “有哇，那是第二年，报名参加出国志愿军啊！也是什么都准备好了，单等出发要走了。母亲又跑来了。还说：‘你两个姐姐参加了解放军，我一个也摸不着，想看看也看不到。你们姊妹三个，又属你小，说什么也得守在我们跟前。’就这样，人们说我年岁不够，没有得到家庭同意，又留下了。要不然，我早就到了朝鲜前线上了……！”她又含羞地低下头，不说话了。
    “那位老太太究竟是谁呢！”我问。
    “就是我妈妈啊！刚才不是给你说了吗，我一听说她来，真是又气又恨。心想：这回可又完啦！早先要飞上天空，她不放；这回又要走上大海，她怎么肯放呢？可是这次她没有哭闹，反而叫我努力学好。”
    “这是怎么回事？”我好奇地问着。
    “她也进步了呀！她还说，过去我思想落后，还能光落后吗？不过，这次她先看见了姐姐。姐姐的队伍回到了蚌埠，姐姐喜爱我，我也喜爱姐姐。可是，这次姐姐很严肃。她说：‘你去学驾船，是不是想把它做为终身事业？想好了吗？’我说：‘想好了！’姐姐又说：‘要去，你就下决心学会，学好；要是没有决心，就干脆别去。你要知道，国家培养一个人材是多么不容易。你有决心吗？’姐姐那股严肃劲儿，反而弄得我不好意思起来。但是我说：‘我有决心学会，学好，绝不辜负国家的培养。’”    （未完）（附图片）
