    Introduction to the Forty-Second Issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" (Chinese Edition)
    The forty-second issue of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, 1953, has been published.
    The main content of this issue is the Third World Trade Union Congress. This issue reports on the progress of the congress and publishes an editorial entitled "A Congress of Close Unity of Working People." The editorial points out that the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress is a historically significant event in the development of the world trade union movement. Representatives of many trade unions that have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions also participated in the congress. This fact powerfully proves that the desire of working people and their trade unions to strive for unity is growing. The working class in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries has risen more and more resolutely to fight against the monopoly capitalists' attacks on their rights and freedoms, against militarization and the policy of preparing for new wars, to further and comprehensively exert the initiative of the working people in the struggle for peace, to enable them to participate more widely and more organizationally in the movement to strive for a peaceful settlement of international disputes, to maintain the close unity of the forces of peace, and to increase vigilance, so that they will certainly be able to thwart the aggressive plans of the instigators of new wars.
    Important articles published in this issue include: "The Economic Accounting System of Enterprises in the People's Republic of Bulgaria" by A. Dimitrov, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party; "The Albanian Labor Party Strengthens Education on Revolutionary Vigilance" by Sha. Bakai, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party; "What the Labor Party Annual Conference Shows" by Jo. Gollan, Member of the Political Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain; and "The Results of the Finnish Municipal Elections" by Vi. Pessi, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Finland.
    A. Dimitrov's article discusses the value of the economic accounting system, combining the experience of implementing the economic accounting system in the Bulgarian enterprise sector. The article points out that economic accounting is a socialist management method, the purpose of which is to ensure the continuous growth of socialist accumulation, which is the basis for the upsurge of the national economy and the improvement of the living standards of the working people. Economic accounting is incompatible with mismanagement and waste, and it is a means to ensure the maximum mobilization of internal resources of enterprises for socialist construction. The establishment of the economic accounting system creates great possibilities for completing and overfulfilling production plans.
    Sha. Bakai's article points out that the Yugoslav Tito government and the royalist fascists of Italy often send special agents and saboteurs into Albanian territory and carry out provocations and sabotage on the border, but they have all suffered disgraceful failures. However, frequent external sabotage activities have made the remnants of domestic reactionaries rampant. Therefore, raising revolutionary vigilance has become an urgent task for the Albanian Labor Party and the working people. Raising vigilance within the Party first requires maintaining the purity of the Party ranks. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十二期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第四十二期已经出版。
    本期的主要内容是世界工会第三次代表大会。本期报道了大会进行的情况，并以“劳动人民精诚团结的大会”为题发表社论。社论指出：世界工会第三次代表大会的召开，是世界工会运动发展中的一桩具有历史意义的事件。许多没有加入世界工联的工会的代表们也参加了这次大会。这个事实有力地证明劳动人民及其工会争取团结的愿望正在日益增长。资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的工人阶级，已愈益坚决地奋起斗争，反对垄断资本家进攻他们的权利和自由，反对军国主义化和准备新战争的政策，进一步全面发挥劳动人民在和平斗争中的积极性，使他们更加广泛、更有组织地参加争取和平解决国际争端的运动，保持和平力量的精诚团结，提高警惕，这样就一定能够挫败新战争挑拨者的侵略计划。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：保加利亚共产党中央委员会候补委员阿·季米特洛夫的“保加利亚人民共和国企业的经济核算制”，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会候补委员沙·柏卡伊的“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党加强革命警惕性的教育”，英国共产党政治委员会委员约·高兰的“工党年会说明了什么”，芬兰共产党总书记维·培西的“芬兰市政选举的结果”。
    阿·季米特洛夫的文章结合保加利亚企业部门推行经济核算制的经验，论述了经济核算制的价值。文章指出：经济核算是社会主义的管理方法，其目的在于保证社会主义积累的不断增长，而这种积累是国民经济高涨和提高劳动群众生活水平的基础。经济核算是与管理不得法和浪费势不两立的，它是保证最大限度地动员企业内部资源以进行社会主义建设的一个手段。经济核算制的建立为完成和超额完成生产计划创造巨大的可能性。
    沙·柏卡伊的文章指出：南斯拉夫铁托政府和意大利的保皇法西斯分子经常派遣特务和破坏分子到阿尔巴尼亚境内，并在边境进行挑衅和破坏，但都遭到了可耻的失败。然而，频繁的外来破坏活动已使国内反动分子残余猖狂起来。因此，提高革命警惕，成为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和劳动人民当前的迫切任务。在党内提高警惕性，首先就是要保持党的队伍的纯洁性。（新华社）
