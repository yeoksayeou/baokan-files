Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and other provinces have deployed winter schools to propagate the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period to farmers. In some areas, winter schools have already started.

The Hebei Provincial Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee, in its November 17th notice regarding political education in the 1953 winter schools, determined that the propaganda should focus on helping farmers understand why they should take the socialist road and the benefits of selling grain to the state; propagandize mutual aid and cooperation, improve technology, and increase grain production, so that farmers can understand the importance of organizing to develop mutual aid and cooperation in the national economy, how farmers can transition to socialism, and how to improve agricultural technology and increase grain production to meet the needs of national construction. Shanxi Province has also uniformly deployed the comprehensive launching of general line and general task propaganda and education work in this year's winter schools. The Shanxi Provincial Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee has printed teaching materials. Shaanxi Province will use the time allocated to political classes in winter schools to conduct general line propaganda and education to farmers two to three times every half month. The Winter School Work Instructions issued by the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government's Cultural and Educational Committee also particularly emphasized coordinating winter school work with the central tasks of rural areas.

All regions have paid attention to the training of winter school teachers. Shanxi Province plans to train 30,000 political teachers. Some counties in the Xinzhou and Yanbei Special Districts of the province have already begun training. Taiyuan City has trained more than 300 political teachers. Suiyuan Province has trained political teachers in seventeen units. Most counties in Shaanxi Province have held winter school teacher training classes at different times, training more than 10,000 teachers throughout the province. The political teachers of winter schools in Zhejiang Province are planned to be selected from rural district and township cadres, Party members, and League members. In order to implement the principle of "the people teach the people," Zhejiang is preparing to mobilize a group of teachers who were originally in winter schools and people's schools, as well as students who have learned 2,000 characters, to undergo short-term political and professional training, and then serve as cultural and educational teachers.

Sichuan Province's cultural and educational propaganda departments are vigorously promoting the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period.

The Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened two propaganda work meetings on November 19th and 23rd, attended by provincial-level cultural and educational propaganda departments, to review past propaganda work based on the general line, and mobilized all cultural and educational propaganda departments to go all out and permeate the propaganda of the general line into every task. The Sichuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, and the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League have recently held special meetings to discuss the issue of propagating the general line in light of the different characteristics of workers, women, and youth, and have formulated propaganda work plans.

Currently, newspapers and periodicals such as the Sichuan Daily and Sichuan Masses have opened special columns to publish popular speeches promoting the general line. Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station has added programs on the general line to its worker and farmer programs, and will also hold a broadcast lecture series on general line studies. The Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles is organizing a large number of literary and art workers to create literary and artistic works related to the general line. The Sichuan People's Publishing House will publish nine kinds of popular reading materials and pictures promoting the general line. The loose-leaf selection of documents on the general line recently published by the publishing house has been issued more than 1.2 million copies and is still in short supply. Hundreds of film and slide projection teams will also go deep into the countryside to conduct socialist education for the vast number of farmers. Hundreds of cultural centers and cultural stations will also use various forms popular with the masses to promote the general line. Party propagandists are the backbone of this propaganda campaign. In Chengdu, where the propaganda campaign started earlier, more than 180 lecturers and more than 4,600 propagandists are participating in this propaganda. The city has held more than 100 large-scale representative meetings and report meetings. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河北省扫盲工作委员会在十一月十七日发出的关于一九五三年冬学进行政治教育的通知中，确定在宣传中着重使农民了解为什么要走社会主义的道路，和把粮食卖给国家的好处；宣传互助合作，改进技术和提高粮食产量的道理，使农民了解组织起来发展互助合作在国家经济中的重要意义，和农民们怎样才能过渡到社会主义，怎样才能改进农业技术、提高粮食产量，以适应国家建设的需要。山西省也统一布置了今年冬学中普遍开展总路线总任务的宣传教育工作。山西省扫盲工作委员会已印发了教材。陕西省各县将利用冬学政治课的时间，每半月向农民进行总路线的宣传教育两次到三次。浙江省人民政府文化教育委员会发出的冬学工作指示中，也特别着重指出要配合农村中心任务来进行冬学工作。
    各地都注意了训练冬学教师的工作。山西省准备训练政治教师三万人。该省忻县专区、雁北专区部分县已着手训练。太原市已训练了政治教师三百多人。绥远省已有十七个单位训练了政治教师。陕西省大部县分先后举办了冬学教师训练班，全省共训练了教师一万多人。浙江省冬学的政治教师准备由农村区乡干部、党员、团员来担任。浙江各地为贯彻“以民教民”的方针，准备动员一批原在冬学、民校中的教员和已识两千字的学员，进行短期的政治和业务训练后，担任文化教育的师资。（新华社）
