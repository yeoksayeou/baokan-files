Cadres of the Central Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Construction Engineering
Combine General Line Study with Work Review and Summary

Over four thousand cadres of the Central Ministry of Foreign Trade began studying the general line of the state during the transition period in mid-November.

In order to ensure that all cadres can basically grasp the spirit of the general line and general tasks through this study, and correctly implement the general line in future work, Xu Xuehan, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, will give a briefing to all cadres on November 26 to enlighten them on studying the general line during the document study stage. A study reference outline will also be prepared to help cadres delve into key issues during discussions. For comrades who lack reading ability and general staff with lower cultural levels, theoretical instructors will provide simple explanations to help them understand the main content of the general line.

After the documents are studied, it is planned to conduct a systematic review of foreign trade work based on the spirit of the general line, on the basis of improving the ideological awareness of cadres, so that the study can achieve greater results.

In order to ensure that cadres have sufficient study time, it is stipulated that Wednesday afternoons are for study. The Party Committee has also decided that during the general line study period, the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the Trade Union should all focus their activities on ensuring the success of the general line study. Party members are required to consciously ensure eight to nine hours of study time (part-time) per week.

The Party Committee has established an office to strengthen leadership over the study of the general line. Under the direct leadership of the Party Committee, a division of labor and responsibility approach is adopted to go deep into various units to help solve problems in the study.

According to inspections, all units of the Ministry of Foreign Trade have specifically formulated study plans and have begun reading relevant documents on the general line.

Furthermore, the cadres of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering have begun studying the general line of the state during the transition period. During this study, all cadres of the ministry will conduct a serious year-end work summary in accordance with the spirit of the general line.

In order to ensure that all comrades participating in this study can understand the spirit and essence of the general line, in addition to organizing everyone to carefully study and conscientiously study the designated required and reference documents, the leadership plans to organize the following special reports: "What is the general line and general task of the state during the transition period," "The basic tasks of the Five-Year Plan," "State Capitalism," "The important significance of grain in national economic construction." At the same time, study outlines will be distributed, and discussion questions will be proposed to help everyone specifically grasp the focus of the study.

In terms of study guidance, it is emphasized that leading cadres must first study well, improve their ideological and political level, so as to conduct ideological leadership for their subordinate cadres. Since the first week of this month, Wan Li, Vice Minister of Construction Engineering, has personally presided over the study discussion meeting of senior-level cadres.

On the 16th of this month, Vice Minister Wan Li gave a report to all cadres on the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period. He called on everyone to study diligently, work hard, improve their political and ideological level, and strive to implement the general line and general tasks of the transition period. (Tian Min)
