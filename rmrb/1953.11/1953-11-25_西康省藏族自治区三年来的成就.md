    Achievements of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province in the Past Three Years
    Zhang Zhengming
    Editor's Note: November 24th marks the third anniversary of the establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province. The achievements of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region in various aspects over the past three years have been enormous. Among them, the achievements in realizing the nationalization of autonomous organs should be particularly emphasized. The nationalization of autonomous organs is the core issue of the policy of national regional autonomy, that is, ethnic minority cadres are responsible for the main work of the autonomous region, using their own languages and scripts, and appropriately applying their own ethnic forms to manage the internal affairs of their own ethnic groups. However, some regions that have already implemented national regional autonomy have not paid enough attention to the issue of nationalization of autonomous organs. The party and government leading organs in these regions should take necessary steps to gradually realize the nationalization of various autonomous organs. This article is particularly worth referring to for various regions in this regard. The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province is located in the eastern part of the Kangzang Plateau and is a rich semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area. It has a population of more than 500,000, of which Tibetans account for more than 80%, and the rest are Han, Yi, and Hui.
    The autonomous region was established in November 1950. Over the past three years, all aspects of work have made significant progress. The estrangement between ethnic groups caused by the instigation of reactionary rulers in history has been basically eliminated. The Tibetan people call the local Han cadres and the People's Liberation Army "Jiasheba" (new Han people); internal disputes among Tibetans have also been mostly reconciled. In the two years after the establishment of the autonomous region's People's Government, more than 3,000 cases of new and old disputes, large and small, were mediated, and some disputes that had lasted for decades were also satisfactorily resolved.
    Agricultural production is developing year by year. In the past, agricultural production technology in the area was very backward, and individual areas still used wooden plows and slash-and-burn methods. In order to enable the Tibetan people to get rid of backwardness and poverty, the autonomous region's People's Government has adopted a series of measures, such as vigorously subsidizing poor farmers, expanding cultivated land area, and improving production tools and farming methods. More than 50,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in the entire region, meeting the needs of many landless and land-scarce households. The autonomous region's People's Government has successively distributed more than 120,000 pieces of agricultural tools and provided a large amount of grain and loans, solving the difficulties of the masses in production. State-owned farms and agricultural technology guidance stations have been established as key points and are gradually teaching the masses to use new agricultural tools and improve farming methods. The total grain output of the region increased by more than 2,400 tons last year compared to the year before, and increased by more than 4,600 tons this year compared to last year. This year, grain production has generally increased by 10% to 20% in various places, and some areas have increased by 20% to 30%. Daofu County's harvest this year is rarely seen in history, with each mu generally producing more than 300 jin, reaching the provincial standard for high yield.
    Animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion of the Tibetan people's production and is inseparable from the Tibetan people's lives. The autonomous region's People's Government has adopted a policy of firmly protecting and vigorously supporting animal husbandry. Four veterinary epidemic prevention stations have been established throughout the region, preventing and controlling diseases in more than 200,000 head of livestock. The veterinary epidemic prevention stations have also collected and summarized the herders' experience in feeding livestock and promoted it. This year, the number of livestock deaths in the entire autonomous region is striving to be reduced by 70% compared to last year.
    The development of trade plays a huge role in promoting agricultural and animal husbandry production and improving people's lives. The trade institutions in the autonomous region strive to purchase more than 60 kinds of local specialties such as medicinal materials and furs that are sold far and wide, and fully supply agricultural tools, wool shears, iron pots, tea, maroon cloth, and other essential and beloved items for the Tibetan people. The opening of sales channels for local specialties has greatly improved the lives of the Tibetan people. Before liberation, few people in Xiangcheng County dug medicinal materials. This year, in just the first, fourth, and fifth districts, more than 1,000 people went to the mountains to dig medicinal materials during the slack season. Some people could earn 150,000 yuan a day. Tea is an indispensable necessity for the Tibetan people. Before liberation, poor Tibetans often used withered leaves as tea. Now, because the prices of local specialties have increased, Tibetans can afford to drink tea. In the past three years, various trade institutions have supplied a total of 1.29 million packages of tea, which is about twice as much as in the same period before liberation. Moreover, the supply is gradually increasing. The tea supplied in the first half of this year increased by 140% compared to the same period last year.
    Along with the improvement of economic life, cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed considerably. There are currently 83 primary schools in the region, with more than 7,600 primary school students. Compared with the end of 1950, the number of schools has doubled and the number of students has increased by 1.7 times. In addition, there are also one ethnic school and one middle school each. County-level health centers have been generally established, and mobile medical teams have gone deep into remote areas to treat Tibetan people.
    The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province also has good achievements in the nationalization of autonomous organs, an important link in implementing the policy of national regional autonomy.
    The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province is relatively quickly realizing the principle that autonomous organs should be mainly composed of ethnic personnel who implement regional autonomy. The autonomous region's People's Government has widely united leading figures who have contact with the masses, absorbed a large number of patriotic intellectuals, and cultivated activists from the masses in various practical works to participate in various tasks of the autonomous region. Among the members of the autonomous region's People's Government and the People's Governments of various counties (except for Luding County, which is inhabited by Han people), Tibetans account for 97%. The responsible cadres of the people's governments at all levels are mostly Tibetans. For example, the section chiefs of the Kangding County People's Government are mostly promoted from general Tibetan cadres. The ethnic school, established in January 1951, has trained more than 2,500 cadres, of which Tibetans account for more than 90%. The Southwest Nationalities Institute and other relevant departments have trained many cadres with certain political level and specialized skills for the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The number of ethnic minority technical cadres is increasing day by day. Before August last year, there were only more than 30 ethnic minority cadres in the trade system, but now it has increased to 126. Among the more than 120 cadres in various agricultural technology guidance stations, 109 are Tibetan cadres who graduated from the agricultural cadre training class of the Southwest Nationalities Institute. Under the care of the higher-level party and government organs and with the help of Han cadres who teach while working, ethnic minority cadres have gradually become familiar with policies and business. For example, She Ga Chu, a Tibetan cadre of the Ganzi County Trading Company, was illiterate when he first joined the work, but he was able to issue invoices after two months. Kongda Dengzhu, the deputy district chief of the Muya District People's Government in Kangding County, has become a model worker.
    The leaders of the autonomous region have always attached importance to the use of ethnic languages, but some Han cadres have not paid enough attention to ethnic languages, and coupled with the lack of translation talents, most of the official documents used Han Chinese before last year, which was quite inconvenient for Tibetan cadres. In November last year, the Third People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Autonomous Region passed resolutions such as the "Implementation Measures for the Development of Ethnic Languages." The resolution stipulates that official documents of the people's governments at all levels in the autonomous region should be mainly in Tibetan, and notices, propaganda materials, and learning documents should be printed and distributed in both Tibetan and Han languages; the resolution also stipulates that Han cadres should strive to learn Tibetan language and script, and those who learn proficiently will be rewarded, and ethnic minority cadres will also be rewarded for learning Chinese language and script on a voluntary basis; at the same time, it also stipulates that Yi language and script should be used in Yi areas. In order to implement this resolution, the autonomous region's People's Government has taken various measures, the first of which is to expand the translation institutions. Since February this year, all official documents have used both Tibetan and Han languages, and Tibetan cadres can directly read them without translation. The autonomous region's People's Government has also carried out research work on unified translation, overcoming the difficulties in reading caused by inconsistent translations.
    Han cadres learning ethnic languages not only facilitates work, but also promotes ethnic feelings and strengthens ethnic unity. Learning Tibetan language and script by Han cadres in the autonomous region has now become a common and regular activity. Miao Fengshu, secretary of the Kangding Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other leading cadres have taken the lead in learning. Many Han cadres have included learning Tibetan language and script in their patriotic covenants. The autonomous region-level organs and the Kangding County-level organs have also organized committees for learning Tibetan language and script, and hired 17 people who are proficient in Tibetan language and script to serve as professors, and regular learning began in early May this year. In order to cultivate ethnic language cadres, the ethnic school has set up a language class and has initially developed a rapid learning method.
    Tibetan primary schools and ethnic schools in the autonomous region completely teach in Tibetan language, and the Culture and Education Department of the autonomous region's People's Government has compiled and printed some Tibetan primary school textbooks. The ethnic school and the normal class of Kangding Middle School are vigorously training teachers who can teach in Tibetan. The excellent art of the Tibetan people has been given due attention. The art research association in the autonomous region has collected about 100 beautiful folk songs and dances.
    Appropriately adopting ethnic forms allows various tasks to go deeper into the masses. From May 20th (April 8th in the lunar calendar) to May 22nd this year, the Kangding Tibetan people held their annual "Mountain Turning Festival." This "Mountain Turning Festival" was the largest in Kangding's history. The Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government coordinated various activities of the masses and held exhibitions of new agricultural tools, hygiene, local specialties, etc. The Propaganda Department of the Kangding Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Propaganda Department of the Kangding County Committee set up wired broadcasts to publicize ethnic policies and broadcast various cultural and entertainment programs; they also organized dozens of propagandists to widely publicize the victory of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, the country's construction, and ethnic policies among the masses, so that the people of all ethnic groups participating in the "Mountain Turning Festival" received another education in patriotism and internationalism. The trade department of Ganzi County used the form of a temple fair favored by Tibetans from June 15th to 22nd to hold a material exchange conference. During the conference, Tibetan operas were performed, horse races were held, pot dances were performed, and transactions were carried out, which was very popular among the Tibetan people. More than 5,000 people from various districts participated in the conference, and people from various lama temples also participated. At the conference, state-owned trading departments and Tibetan and Han merchants supplied daily necessities such as tea, iron pots, cloth, and sugar that the Tibetan people needed most, with a total turnover of more than 300 million yuan. The conference also held an exhibition of local specialties and used loudspeakers to publicize the price policies for purchasing local specialties and the production specifications of local specialties.
    The autonomous region's People's Government has appropriately improved the system of work, study, and life in accordance with the customs of the Tibetan people, and has set up furniture and supplies that Tibetan cadres and religious believers are accustomed to using. Therefore, some Tibetan people who used to live at home but now participate in government work have also voluntarily moved into government organs.
    The achievements of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province in the past three years are inseparable from the help of Han cadres. The Han cadres in the autonomous region have been loved by the Tibetan people for their sincere and arduous service to ethnic minorities. Fei Pengyan, a young female Han cadre and member of the Communist Youth League in Xinlong County, sacrificed her life heroically while fighting a mountain fire. The local Tibetan people buried her with their own ethnic funeral rites and held a memorial service. Awang Jiacuo, vice chairman of the autonomous region's People's Government, praised Han cadres as "stars in the sky."
    Last summer and autumn, cadres throughout the region studied ethnic policies and inspected the implementation of ethnic policies, focusing on criticizing the Han chauvinistic ideology and style existing among Han cadres. Under the influence of the earnest self-criticism of Han cadres, ethnic minority cadres were deeply moved and also automatically examined narrow nationalist ideas. As a result, Tibetan and Han cadres united more closely, and the work of the autonomous region has made new progress.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the higher-level People's Government, the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province is moving towards a broader and more beautiful future on the basis of its tremendous achievements in the past three years.

    西康省藏族自治区三年来的成就
    张正明
    编者按：十一月二十四日是西康省藏族自治区成立的三周年。西康藏族自治区三年来各项工作的成就是巨大的，其中应特别提出的是在实现自治机关民族化方面的成绩。自治机关的民族化是民族区域自治政策的核心问题，即由民族干部负责自治区的主要工作，用他们自己的语言文字，并适当地运用他们自己的民族形式管理他们自己民族内部的事务。但是，现在有一些已经实行民族区域自治的地区对自治机关民族化问题还没有引起足够的重视。这些地区的党政领导机关应该采取必要的步骤，使各自治机关逐步实现民族化。本文在这一点上特别值得各地参考。    西康省藏族自治区位于康藏高原东部，是一个富饶的半农半牧区。境内人口有五十多万，其中藏族占百分之八十以上，其余为汉族、彝族和回族。
    自治区成立于一九五○年十一月，三年以来，各项工作都已有显著成绩。历史上反动统治者的挑拨离间所造成的民族间的隔阂基本上消除了。藏民把当地汉族干部和人民解放军叫做“嘉色巴”（新汉人）；藏族内部的打冤家纠纷也多已和解，自治区人民政府成立后的两年中，就调解了大小新旧纠纷三千多件，有些达几十年之久的纠纷也圆满解决了。
    农业生产正在一年年地发展。过去，当地农业生产技术很落后，个别地区还使用着木犁和刀耕火种的方法。为了使藏族人民摆脱落后、穷困的生活，自治区人民政府采取了大力资助贫苦农民、扩大耕地面积、改进生产工具及耕作方法等一系列的措施。全区已开垦荒地五万多亩，满足了许多无地、缺地户的需求。自治区人民政府先后发放了十二万多件农具，并大量贷粮贷款，解决了群众在生产中的困难。国营农场及农业技术指导站已重点建立，正逐渐教会群众使用新式农具，改进耕作方法。全区粮食产量，去年较前年增加二千四百多吨，今年又较去年增加四千六百多吨。今年各地普遍增产粮食一成至二成，有些地区增产二成至三成。道孚县今年的丰收为历年所少见，每亩一般均可产三百斤以上，达到全省的丰产标准。
    畜牧业在藏族人民的生产中占着很大的比重，与藏族人民的生活密不可分。自治区人民政府对畜牧业采取了坚决保护和大力扶持的方针。全区已设立四个兽疫防治工作站，防治牲畜二十余万头。各兽疫防治工作站并搜集和总结了牧民的饲畜经验，加以推广。今年全自治区的牲畜死亡数争取较去年减少百分之七十。
    贸易事业的发展，对推动农、牧业生产并改善人民生活起着巨大的作用。自治区内的贸易机构，尽力收购六十多种远销各地的药材和兽皮等土特产，并充分供应农具、羊毛剪、铁锅、茶叶、绛色布等藏族人民必需的及心爱的物品。土特产销路开辟后大大改善了藏族人民生活。乡城县解放前很少有人挖药材，今年仅一、四、五三个区就有一千多人在农闲时上山挖药材，有的人一天可得十五万元。茶叶是藏族人民不可缺的生活必需品，解放前贫苦藏民常以枯叶代茶。现在因土特产品价格提高，藏民都能喝到茶了。三年来各贸易机构共供应茶叶一百二十九万包，约超过解放前同等时间的一倍。而且供应数目在逐渐增加，今年上半年供应的茶叶较去年同时期增加了百分之一百四十。
    随着经济生活的改善，文教、卫生事业也有了相当的发展。全区现有小学八十三所，小学生七千六百多名。与一九五○年底比较，学校增加了一倍，学生增加了一点七倍。此外，还有民族学校及中学各一所。各县卫生院已普遍建立，并有巡回医疗小组深入偏远地区为藏民治病。
    西康省藏族自治区在自治机关民族化这一贯彻民族区域自治政策的重要环节上也有着良好的成绩。
    西康省藏族自治区较为迅速地实现着自治机关应以实行区域自治的民族人员为主要成分组成的原则。自治区人民政府广泛团结了与群众有联系的领袖人物，大量吸收爱国知识分子，并在各项实际工作中培养群众里的积极分子，参加自治区的各项工作。自治区人民政府及各县人民政府委员中（汉族聚居的泸定县除外），藏族占百分之九十七。各级人民政府的负责干部，绝大多数是藏族。如康定县人民政府的科长，大多是由藏族一般干部中提拔的。一九五一年一月创立的民族学校，已培养出干部二千五百多名，其中藏族占百分之九十以上。西南民族学院及其他有关部门，为藏族自治区培养了许多具有一定政治水平与专门技能的干部。少数民族技术干部的数量与日俱增。贸易系统去年八月以前只有三十多个少数民族干部，到现在已增至一百二十六个。各农业技术指导站的一百二十多个干部中，有一百零九个是西南民族学院农业干部训练班毕业的藏族干部。在上级党政机关的关怀和汉族干部在工作中用边做、边教的方式帮助下，少数民族干部逐渐熟悉了政策和业务。如甘孜县贸易公司藏族干部设呷初参加工作时不识字，两个月后就能开发票了。康定县木雅区人民政府副区长孔达登珠已成为工作模范。
    自治区领导上对使用民族语文是一贯重视的，但也有些汉族干部对民族语文重视不足，加以翻译人材缺乏，因而在去年以前公文大多使用汉文，藏族干部颇感不便。去年十一月，自治区第三届各族各界人民代表会议通过了“关于发展民族语言文字实施办法”等决议。决议中规定了自治区内各级人民政府行文以藏文为主，告示、宣传品及学习文件用藏、汉两种文字印发；决议中还规定了汉族干部应努力学会藏语、藏文，学习精通的给予奖励，少数民族干部在自愿原则下学会汉语汉文的亦给予奖励；同时，又规定了彝族地区得使用彝语彝文。为了实现这个决议，自治区人民政府采取了种种措施，首先是扩充了翻译机构。从今年二月起，一切公文都使用了藏、汉两种文字，藏族干部无需经过翻译就能直接阅读了。自治区人民政府并已进行统一译词的研究工作，克服因译词不一致而引起的阅读困难。
    汉族干部学会了民族语文，不仅便于工作，且能沟通民族情感，增进民族团结。自治区内的汉族干部学习藏语藏文现已成为普遍而经常的活动。中共康定地委会书记苗逢澍及其他领导干部都带头学习。许多汉族干部把学好藏语藏文订入了爱国公约。自治区一级机关和康定县一级机关，还组织了学习藏语藏文委员会，聘请了十七位对藏语藏文有造诣的人士担任教授工作，从今年五月初开始正规的学习。为了造就民族语文干部，民族学校设立了语文班，已初步研究出一种速成学习方法。
    自治区内的藏民小学和民族学校完全用藏族语文授课，自治区人民政府文教处已编印了一部分藏文初小课本。民族学校和康定中学师范班正大力培养用藏文教课的师资。藏族人民的优秀的艺术得到了应有的珍视，自治区内的艺术研究会，已搜集优美的民歌和舞曲共约一百首。
    适当地采用民族形式，各项工作就更能深入到群众中去。今年五月二十日（夏历四月八日）至二十二日，康定藏族人民举行了一年一度的“转山会”。这次“转山会”是康定历史上最盛大的一次。藏族自治区人民政府配合群众各项活动，举办了新式农具、卫生、土特产等展览会。中共康定地委宣传部和康定县委宣传部设置了有线广播，宣传民族政策，并播送各种文娱节目；还组织了几十个宣传员，在群众中广泛宣传抗美援朝的胜利、祖国建设情况和民族政策，使参加“转山会”的各族人民又受到一次爱国主义与国际主义的教育。甘孜县的贸易部门在今年六月十五日到二十二日，用藏民喜好的庙会形式举办了物资交流大会，在大会期间，一面唱藏戏、赛马、跳锅庄，一面进行交易，非常受藏民欢迎。各区参加大会的群众达五千人以上，各喇嘛寺也都有人来参加。在大会上国营贸易部门和藏、汉族商人供应了藏族人民最需要的茶叶、铁锅、布匹、糖等日常必需品，成交总额达三亿多元。大会还举办了土特产展览，并利用广播筒宣传了收购土特产的价格政策和土特产的生产规格。
    自治区人民政府按照藏族人民的风俗习惯，适当地改进了工作、学习和生活的制度，为藏族干部及信仰宗教的人士设置了他们惯用的家具和用品。因此有些参加政府工作而过去住在家里的藏族人士，现在也自愿搬进政府机关里住。
    西康省藏族自治区三年来的成就，是和汉族干部的帮助分不开的。自治区内的汉族干部，由于他们真心诚意、不辞艰辛地为少数民族服务，受到了藏族人民的爱戴。新龙县汉族女干部青年团员飞鹏燕，为扑灭山火而英勇牺牲，当地藏族人民以本民族的葬仪将她安葬，并举行追悼。自治区人民政府副主席阿旺嘉错，赞扬汉族干部是“天上的星宿”。
    去年夏秋，全区干部进行了民族政策的学习和民族政策执行情况的检查，着重批判了存在于汉族干部中的大汉族主义思想和作风。在汉族干部恳切的自我批评的影响下，少数民族干部深受感动，也自动检查了狭隘民族主义思想。从而藏、汉干部更紧密地团结起来，自治区的工作又有了新的发展。
    西康省藏族自治区在中国共产党和上级人民政府的领导下，在三年来的巨大成就的基础上，正朝着更加广阔、更加美好的前程迈进。
