　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 2nd. (By our special correspondent Jiang Nan) The bilateral talks on the political conference issue have entered their second week, yet the U.S. government representative has returned to the same starting point after going in circles. He continues, without any attempt to conceal it, to insist on his unreasonable demand to oppose discussing and resolving the issue of the members of the political conference first, and opposes neutral nations participating in the political conference.

　　Today, the U.S. representative, Dean, overturned the promise clearly made by the U.S. government in its notification of October 14th. Despite the fact that in that notification, the U.S. government clearly stated that their representative attending the bilateral talks was prepared to "exchange views on the issue of the members of the political conference," Dean repeated his arrogant and unreasonable attitude from the beginning of the talks, directly opposing the discussion and resolution of the membership issue. At the meeting on the 27th, Dean claimed: "Our representative is not authorized" to "discuss and resolve the issue of the members of the political conference." Although in the following days he repeatedly opposed neutral countries participating in the political conference, today he said again: "You already know my authority." He once again threatened that if the agenda of discussing and resolving the membership issue first were adopted, it "would only lead to further delays" in the bilateral talks. It is remembered that on the second day of the bilateral talks, Dean arrogantly threatened that if the meeting was not conducted according to their method, the bilateral talks would not reach an agreement. The U.S. side uses this dogmatic attitude, which they know is useless, to conduct the meeting, which can only lead to serious doubts that they do not want to solve the problem.

　　Today, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese governments once again asked the U.S. government representative to show sincerity in resolving the problem. The Korean and Chinese representatives pointed out that true sincerity must be demonstrated by practical actions. If your side still intends to continue these talks and complete the task of promoting the early convening of the political conference, your side has no reason to continue to oppose our proposed agenda and immediately enter into a discussion of the issue of the members of the political conference. However, the U.S. government representative did not answer, and he proposed adjourning the meeting until 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

　　Dean's statements in and out of the meeting over the past eight days, combined with the U.S. propaganda outside the meeting, show that the U.S. government is precisely trying to delay and sabotage the bilateral talks according to a pre-determined plan. On October 27th, sources close to Dean revealed outside the meeting that "the meeting may continue for a week without a definite result," while Dean claimed at the meeting that if the Korean and Chinese representatives did not accept the U.S. agenda, the talks would be "fruitless." Today, a United Nations Command source even "predicted" before the meeting that "in the best case, the talks will last at least four more weeks." And Dean also issued a warning at the meeting about "further delays" in the talks. Obviously, this is precisely the signal of the U.S. deliberately delaying and sabotaging the bilateral talks.

### 美方代表继续在会谈中采取兜圈子的伎俩  证明美国正在按照预定计划拖延双方会谈

    美方代表继续在会谈中采取兜圈子的伎俩
    证明美国正在按照预定计划拖延双方会谈
    【新华社开城二日电】本社特派记者江南报道：关于政治会议问题的双方会谈进入了第二周，然而美国政府代表却在兜完一圈之后回到他头一天开步走的老地方。他毫不掩饰地继续坚持反对首先讨论和解决政治会议的成员问题的无理主张，反对中立国家参加政治会议。
    美方代表迪安今天又推翻美国政府在其十月十四日的通知中所明白提出的诺言。尽管在那个通知中，美国政府明明说他们的参加双方会谈的代表准备“就政治会议的成员问题交换意见”，迪安却又重复他在会谈刚开始时的无权讨论成员问题的蛮横无理的态度，直截了当地反对讨论和解决成员问题。在二十七日的会上，迪安曾声称：“我方代表无权”“讨论及解决政治会议的成员问题”。虽然在以后的几天中他曾喋喋不休地反对中立国参加政治会议，但今天他又说：“你已经知道我的权限”。他并再一次威胁说：如果要通过首先讨论和解决成员问题的议程，“将只会导向进一步拖延”双方会谈。人们记得迪安在双方会谈开始的第二天，就蛮横霸道地威胁说，如果不按照他们的办法开会，双方会谈就不能取得协议。美方用这种明知是毫无作用的专断态度来开会，只能使人严重怀疑他们并不想解决问题。
    朝中两国政府代表今天再一次要求美国政府代表拿出解决问题的诚意来，朝中代表指出：真正的诚意必须见诸实际行动。如果你方还有意使这次会谈继续进行下去，并完成其促进政治会议早日召开的任务，你方就没有任何理由继续反对我方建议的议程，并立即进入关于政治会议成员问题的讨论。然而，美国政府代表没有回答，他提议休会到明天上午十一时。
    八天以来迪安会内的发言与会外的美国宣传，表明美国政府正是企图按照预定的计划来拖延和破坏双方会谈。在十月二十七日，接近迪安的人士在会外透露：“会议可能继续一周而没有确定的结果”，迪安则在会上声称假如朝中代表不接受美国的议程，会谈将是“没有结果的”。今天，一个联合国军方面人士甚至在开会前就“预示”“在最好的情况下会谈也至少还要有四个星期”之久。而迪安则在会上也发出了关于会谈要“进一步拖延”的预告。显然这正是美方蓄意拖延和破坏双方会谈的警号。
