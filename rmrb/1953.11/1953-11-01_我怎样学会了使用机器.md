    How I Learned to Use Machines
    Zhang Shixiang, Female Worker, Processing Section, Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant
    I am a female worker in the processing section of the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant. In the first year of the motherland's First Five-Year Plan, I came from the countryside to Anshan Iron and Steel, the motherland's heavy industry base. I am happily learning science and technology at the Seamless Steel Tube Plant. The Seamless Steel Tube Plant was built with Soviet assistance. Soviet experts, unafraid of all difficulties, patiently taught us operating techniques, sometimes explaining them to us in detail three times in a row. They personally guided us from the sidelines during actual work. When some of our female comrades forgot to wear hats, the Soviet experts promptly pointed it out to us, fearing that we would have personal accidents and mechanical accidents. At the same time, the Soviet experts also often educated us to cherish the machine tools.
    Under the enthusiastic education of the Soviet experts and the patient assistance of technicians and master workers, I have been transformed from a rural girl into a female worker who can also operate a machine. I can also repair minor machine problems. I am deeply grateful to the Party for my education and to the Soviet experts for their help. In the future, under the leadership and cultivation of the Party and the Communist Youth League, I will more actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, ask questions if I don't understand, and never pretend to know. At the same time, I will help other comrades. On this basis, we will learn from each other, exchange experiences, do a good job in safe mechanical trial rolling, ensure that no accidents occur, and produce more high-quality steel pipes to support the country's economic construction.

    我怎样学会了使用机器
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂  加工工段女工  张世香
    我是鞍钢无缝钢管厂加工工段的一个女工。当祖国进入五年建设计划的头一年时，我从农村来到了祖国重工业基地——鞍钢。在无缝钢管厂愉快地学习着科学技术。无缝钢管厂是在苏联援助下建立起来的，苏联专家不怕一切困难，耐心地教给我们操作技术，有时一连三次给我们详细地讲解。在实际工作中亲自在旁指导。我们有些女同志忘记了戴帽子，苏联专家就及时给我们提出，恐怕我们发生人身事故和机械事故。同时，苏联专家还经常教育我们要爱护机床。
    在苏联专家这种热心的教育下和技术员、老师傅的耐心帮助下，我由一个农村姑娘变成也能操作一台机器的女工了，机器出了小毛病，我也会修理了。我深深感谢党对我的教育和苏联专家对我的帮助。今后，在党和青年团的领导和培养下，我更要积极地学习苏联先进经验，不会就问，决不装懂，同时，要帮助别的同志，在这个基础上互相学习，交流经验，做好安全机械试轧，保证不发生事故，多生产出质量优良的钢管来支援全国的经济建设。
