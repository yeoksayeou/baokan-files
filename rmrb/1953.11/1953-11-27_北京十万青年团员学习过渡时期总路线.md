    Beijing’s 100,000 Youth League Members Study the General Line for the Transition Period
    The 100,000 Youth League members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in Beijing are studying the general line of the state during the transition period.
    In order to enable the city's Youth League members to further understand the general line of the state during the transition period, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League has decided to organize city-wide Youth League members to conduct systematic study from mid-November this year to mid-January next year, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Party Committees at all levels. At the beginning of the study, Yang Shu, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report on "The General Line of the State During the Transition Period" to 1,200 cadres of the Youth League organizations at all levels in the city. In his report, Yang Shu pointed out that Youth League members should love socialism, and should promote socialism to everyone at all times and everywhere, and encourage the youth and the people to fight with full confidence for the realization of the general line and the gradual transition to a socialist society. He also pointed out that socialism is growing in our country every moment, but there are difficulties on the road to transition to a socialist society. The youth should work hard with the people and overcome difficulties with strong perseverance. All Youth League members should work hard for the motherland and create more socialist wealth for the motherland. He pointed out that Youth League members should study Marxism-Leninism hard, learn advanced Soviet science and technology, and struggle against all thoughts and behaviors that hinder the realization of the general line.
    Currently, the Youth League organizations in the city are conveying this report to the Youth League members and organizing discussions. In order to enable the city's Youth League members to study better, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League is also preparing to deeply understand and study the ideological situation of the Youth League members and provide specific guidance and assistance.

    中国新民主主义青年团北京市的十万青年团员，正在学习国家在过渡时期的总路线。
    为了使全市青年团员进一步了解国家在过渡时期的总路线，青年团北京市委特决定从今年十一月中旬到明年一月中旬，组织全市团员在北京市各级党委的领导下进行有系统的学习。在学习开始时，中共北京市委宣传部长杨述向全市青年团各级组织的干部一千二百人作了“国家在过渡时期的总路线”的报告。杨述在报告中指出：青年团员要热爱社会主义，要随时随地向每一个人宣传社会主义，鼓舞青年和人民在一起信心百倍地为实现总路线、逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。他并指出社会主义在我国每时每刻都在生长，但过渡到社会主义社会的前进道路上是有困难的，青年们要和人民在一起艰苦奋斗，以坚强的毅力克服困难。全体团员要为祖国而辛勤劳动，为祖国创造更多的社会主义财富。他指出青年团员要努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习苏联先进科学技术，和一切妨碍实现总路线的思想和行为作斗争。
    现在，全市青年团的组织正分别向全市团员传达这个报告并组织讨论。为了使全市团员更好地学习，青年团北京市委并准备深入了解、研究团员的思想情况，进行具体的指导和帮助。（新华社）
