Soviet literature vividly illustrates a truth: that in the process of creating the world through labor, man not only becomes the master of nature but also creates himself—a new humanity, one with a rich spiritual life and excellent moral qualities.

Soviet literature vividly reflects the arduous struggle of the Soviet people. From the first day they seized power, the Soviet working class, the Soviet laboring people, underwent many trials of fire and blood: armed foreign intervention, the outbreak of civil war, famine, riots, the unrest of Socialist-Revolutionaries and rich peasants, imperialist encirclement and blockade, Trotskyist spies, conspiracies and sabotage… until the Second World War, when they were subjected to the mad attacks of the German fascist bandits. As we see in books like “The Iron Flood,” “Chapayev,” “The Rout,” “Cement,” “Time, Forward!” “A Simple Soldier,” and “The Story of a Real Man,” the Soviet people, united under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, overcame all difficulties and repelled all enemies on the material and spiritual foundation created by socialist labor. They not only defended the socialist motherland but also continuously developed it, eventually making it an invincible and strong fortress for peace-loving people worldwide. The working people and youth all over the world have been inspired by the spirit of the heroic figures created by Soviet literature. Kozhukh, Chapayev, Levinson, Gley, Megalich, Matrosov, and Meresyev have all become teachers and examples for their lives and actions.

Deeply influenced by the life of class oppression and bondage, the growth of a new humanity is not very easy. During the Soviet civil war, although the working class had seized power, not all of the laboring people were organized. The imperialist war brought significant wounds to the country. The people demanded bread and peace and supported the Soviet regime, but they did not yet know how to consolidate the Soviet regime with their own strength. Undoubtedly, the lighthouse of socialist revolution illuminated their path forward, but socialist order and discipline could not be well established all at once, and then the civil war broke out. In Serafimovich's "The Iron Flood," it is reflected how a group of scattered people experienced "suffering and sorrow" and were tempered through "fire and iron" to become an iron force with organized strength.

The heroic image of Chapayev is well known to our readers. But where does his courage, his determination, his power to make the enemy flee in terror come from? It is because the revolutionary regime makes him feel that he is a human being. "I am a human being!" This is the solemn declaration from the bottom of the soul of all the oppressed. Chapayev is just like this: under the education and cultivation of the Party and the political commissar, he links his life with the Soviet regime.

It is because of this kind of awakening of man that the masses unleash unlimited creativity and fighting spirit. The masses become the masters of history, becoming an invincible force.

Awakened people are forever moving towards their ideals, never disappointed or retreating, even if they encounter irreparable destruction. This is also one of the characteristics of the Soviet people. Here, the hero in Fadeyev's "The Rout"—Levinson—stands out before us once again.

On the border of Siberia, the guerrilla force led by Levinson suffered devastating blows from the Japanese intervention army and Kolchak's forces, and in the end, only nineteen people, including himself, were left. However, when he walked out of the forest and saw a group of laboring people in the far-off threshing ground, he "looked with silent, moist eyes at the high sky, the earth that promised bread and peace, the distant people on the threshing ground—he should quickly make them all one with him, just like the eighteen people following him. So he did not cry: he must live and fulfill his duty."

The idea of "Workers of all countries, unite!" is the infinite potential power of the revolution; similarly, it is also the revolutionary force in culture.

However, the purpose of the revolution lies in creation—creating a happy world where true human beings can live. The revolution is merely removing obstacles to "labor creating the world," clearing away the "bloody slaughterhouse," and overthrowing the "feast of human flesh." When the Soviet people repelled the foreign intervention army, quelled the domestic rebellion, and won an environment of peaceful life, the task of repairing the wounds and building the country was brought before the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union. Here, we see the reality reflected in Gladkov's "Cement": A blacksmith, Gley Chumalov, returned from the civil war to the cement factory where he used to work. The factory was completely destroyed, the machines were constantly being dismantled, the workers were busy with their own household affairs: using parts from the factory to make cigarette lighters, raising cattle and sheep; life was clamorous and riotous; Cossacks and bandits were still causing disturbances everywhere in the villages, and in the Party and government organs, there were still many lazy people, those who stole state property, and bureaucrats. And in the process of implementing the New Economic Policy, capitalist ideas grew in the minds of some cadres. Gley, the hero of the working class, saw all this, hated all this, and wanted to make some reforms. He inspected the factory, visited his old comrades, and found a path to reform: The decisive key to the work—the factory must be rebuilt. After he was assigned as the secretary of the Party branch in the factory, he announced his ideas at a "special meeting" of the Party group:

"Comrades, let's not play with words. We've played enough with pigs and cigarette lighters—. Enough. The factory is no longer a factory, but just a cowshed. We are some fools. Is this a serious matter, comrades? Everyone has two paths to take: you can let the devil catch you, or you can grab its tail and manipulate it. It all depends on how confused you are. Our hands are not born to raise sheep and pigs, but to do other things. … There is a new economic line right now. What is this New Economic Policy? Its meaning is: to use a great construction force to slap the devil in the face. Cement is a powerful binding material. We must use cement to complete the great construction of the republic. We are cement, comrades: the working class. ..."

"Use great construction to slap the devil in the face," "use the working class as cement to build the republic," this is the road for the Soviet Union to transition from the New Economic Policy to socialist construction. Starting from this idea, Gley even forgave an old enemy who had sent him to the White Army officers to be executed—engineer Kleist—striving for him to serve for the reconstruction of the factory and calling him a great engineer of the republic. The great mind of the working class is particularly moving and lovable in the depiction of this matter.

But the reconstruction of the factory was not easy: it was necessary to carry out a firm struggle against bureaucrats and those who were corrupt and wasteful, to wage war against the sabotage of bandits, and to fight against all old habits and forces. In the end, naturally, Gley won the victory. It symbolizes that the New Economic Policy advanced through all obstacles. The whole problem lies in restoring the factory in order to make the country enter into socialist life, and at the same time, people are also being transformed by socialism.

What followed was the era of great socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and labor has become a broad theme for writers. Soviet writers describe the arduous struggle spirit of the Soviet laboring people from various different angles. This can be clearly seen in Katayev's "Time, Forward!"

Katayev uses a huge amount of space to write about the work and actions in the cement factory in twenty-four hours. Here, it is no longer a struggle against bureaucracy, life's anxieties and disturbances, but a struggle between advancing ideas and conservative and backward ideas; it is no longer a struggle against economic destruction, but a struggle on how to organize competitions and rapidly build socialism. The question of speed in construction was brought before the working class. Here, there are two distinct contrasting images: that is, Megalich and Nalbandov. Megalich is a strict, careful, and meticulous person. He can rely on the active elements of the workers—Ishchenko Ban—to compete with the cement workers in Kharkov City, and improve the rate of labor in the whole factory by using key demonstration methods. He is truly an image of a Bolshevik who understands the art of leadership and how to build the socialist motherland. And Nalbandov is a person who lacks enthusiasm, is good at "listening to reports and issuing orders," and acts according to so-called "correct laws and knowledge"; but he deviates from reality, does not feel the creative enthusiasm of the workers, and specializes in being jealous of Megalich for being respected as the best leader, and believes that any attempt to strengthen the speed of work is a kind of "villainous heroism," believing that it is not "construction" but "competition." Obviously, such thoughts and spirits are not suitable for the requirements of socialist construction. Victory naturally still belongs to Megalich's side. The thematic idea that Katayev put forward in this novel, by the late period of the Soviet Second Five-Year Plan, the Stakhanov movement appeared. This movement, in its essence, is to develop and use the technical experience of workers, boldly promote the spirit of initiative, to break the "convention-bound" technical views, to accelerate socialist construction. At the same time, the spiritual qualities of the working class have also increased, becoming true masters of nature. We may say this: After this, in Soviet literature, works on the theme of labor have almost developed along this theme idea: we see more and more of the fullness of the spiritual life of the Soviet people and the nobility of their moral qualities in them.

"Time, Forward!" became an important slogan for the Soviet Union at that time to build socialism. It is hard to imagine: The Soviet people could not have achieved such a brilliant victory in the war against German fascism without nearly three five-year plans of socialist construction; and without this brilliant victory, they could not have established today a strong world camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union. This camp is precisely the strongest fortress of peace-loving people all over the world, built by the Soviet people using their labor power as a binding material—cement. Stalin's brilliant foresight lies in this. At the same time, as our Party and Chairman Mao have constantly taught us, it is hard to imagine: Without the great victory of the Soviet anti-fascist war, our people could have achieved the victory of the liberation war so quickly; without the selfless help of the Soviet Union to our country in these years, our economy could have recovered so quickly in just three years, and the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea could have achieved such brilliant achievements. And all this cannot but make us think of the great power created by the labor of the Soviet people.

According to the results of the negotiations between our government delegation and the Soviet government on the Soviet Union's assistance to our country in developing the national economy: Including the enterprises designed by the Soviet Union to help our country in the past three years, by 1959, the Soviet Union will assist our country in building and renovating 141 large-scale enterprises, design and build ninety-one new enterprises, and provide systematic economic and technical assistance to the construction and renovation of fifty enterprises that are currently under construction and renovation. This fact fully demonstrates the selfless heroic spirit of the Soviet people that we seem to be able to touch with our hands, that heroic spirit that nurtures the earth like the sun, that heroic spirit that has been nurtured and strengthened by the idea of "Workers of all countries, unite!" Learn from the heroic actions of the Soviet people with their hard work, diligence, perseverance, and bold initiative! We can only save every penny and use it for the construction of socialist industrialization in our country, so that we will not fail the assistance given to us by the Soviet people with their technical, equipment, and wisdom created by their blood and sweat labor. I believe that the laboring people of our country will grow up like the people of the Soviet Union in the process of socialist industrialization of their own country, and will be brilliantly reflected in the literary works of our country.

    从苏联文学作品中看苏维埃人
    巴　人
    苏联的文学鲜明地说明了一个真理：人不但在他以劳动创造世界的过程中，作了自然的主人，并且创造了自己——新的人类，那具有丰富的精神生活与优美的道德品质的新的人类。
    苏联文学鲜明地反映了苏维埃人民艰苦奋斗的过程。苏联的工人阶级，苏联的劳动人民，从第一天夺得了政权起，经过许多次火与血的考验：外国武装的干涉，国内战争的爆发，饥荒，骚乱，社会革命党人和富农的骚动，帝国主义的包围和封锁，托派间谍阴谋与破坏……直至第二次世界大战中，又遭受到德国法西斯强盗的疯狂进攻。正如我们在
  “铁流”、“夏伯阳”、“毁灭”、“士敏土”、“时间呀，前进！”“普通一兵”和“真正的人”等书中所看到的，苏联人民团结在列宁、斯大林的旗帜下，在社会主义的劳动所创造的物质的和精神的基础上，克服了一切困难，击退了一切敌人。他们不但捍卫了社会主义的祖国，而且使它不断地向前发展，终于使它成为不可战胜的全世界和平人民的坚强堡垒。全世界劳动人民和广大青年受到了苏联文学所创造的英雄人物的精神的鼓舞。郭如鹤、夏伯阳、莱奋生、格利、麦加利、马特洛索夫和密烈西叶夫都成为他们生活的教师和行动的榜样。
    深受过阶级的压迫与束缚的生活，一个新人类的生长是并不十分容易的。在苏联内战时期，工人阶级虽然夺得了政权，但劳动人民并不是全体被组织起来了的。帝国主义的战争带来了国家重大的创伤，人民要求面包与和平，拥护苏维埃政权，但人民还不知道如何用自己力量去巩固苏维埃政权。无疑地，社会主义革命的灯塔照耀着他们前进的道路，但社会主义的秩序与纪律还不可能一下子很好地建立起来，而内战又爆发了。在绥拉菲摩维支的“铁流”里，就反映着一群散漫的人怎样经历了“苦难和悲痛”经过“火与铁”的锻炼，使自己成为有组织力量的铁的队伍。
    夏伯阳的英雄形象是我国读者所熟知的。然而他的勇敢，坚决，他的使敌人望风披靡的力量，是从那里来的呢？是因为革命政权使他感到自己是一个人。“我是一个人啦！”这是一切被压迫者的灵魂底庄严的宣言。夏伯阳就是这样的在党和政治委员的教育培养下，把自己的生命和苏维埃政权联结在一起了。
    就是由于这一种人的觉醒，群众发挥了无限的创造力和战斗精神。群众就成为历史的主人，成为不可战胜的力量。
    觉醒了的人是永远朝着自己的理想前进的，是永远不会失望和退却的，即使他遭到了不可挽回的毁灭。这也是苏联人的性格的特征之一。在这里，法捷耶夫的“毁灭”中的英雄——莱奋生又卓然站立在我们的面前了。
    在西伯利亚的边境上，莱奋生所率领的这一支游击队伍，遭受到日本干涉军与高尔察克的毁灭性的打击，最后只剩下连他自己十九个人了。然而当他走出了森林，看到了远远的打麦场上的一群劳动人民的时候，他“用了沉默的，还是湿润的眼，看着这高远的天空，这约给面包与平和的大地，这在打麦场上的远远的人们，——他应该很快地使他们都变成和自己一气，正如跟在他后面的十八人一样。于是他不哭了：他必须活着，而且来尽自己的义务”。
    全世界无产阶级联合起来这一思想，就是革命的无限的潜在力量；同样，它也是文化上的革命的力量。
    然而，革命的目的乃在于创造——创造真正人类居住的幸福的世界。革命仅仅是为“劳动创造世界”搬去障碍物，打净“血腥的屠场”，推翻“人肉的筵席”的。当苏联人民打退了外国的干涉军，平定了国内的叛乱，赢得和平生活的环境的时候，修补创伤与建设国家的任务，就提出在苏联的工人和农民的面前。在这里，我们看到在革拉特柯夫的“士敏土”中所反映的现实情况：一个铁匠，格利·殊马罗夫从内战中回到了他从前做过工的士敏土工厂。工厂完全破坏了，机器不断在拆毁，工人们忙于自己的家务：用工厂的零件去做打火机，养着牛和羊；生活是叫嚣和暴乱；哥萨克、匪徒仍然在村庄中到处扰乱，党和政府机关里，还有很多懒惰者、盗窃国家财产者和官僚主义者。而在执行新经济政策过程中，某些干部的思想里又滋长了资本主义的思想。工人阶级的英雄——格利，看到这一切，痛恨这一切，想有所改革。他巡视了工厂，他访问了旧日的伙伴，他寻出了一条改革的道路：工作的决定关键——必须把工厂重建起来。他在被派为工厂党组的书记后，在党小组“特别大会”上就宣布了他这样的思想：
    “同志们，我们不要玩弄字句吧。我们已经同猪和打火机玩弄够了——。够了。工厂再也不是一个工厂，只是一个牛栏。我们是一些昏蛋。这是正经事吗，同志们？每一个人都有两条路可走：你可以让魔鬼捉住你，也可以抓住它的尾巴来摆布它。这全要由你们糊涂的程度来决定。我们的手不是生来养羊养猪的，是要作别的事情的。……当下有一种新经济路线。这种新经济政策是什么呢？它的意义就是：用一种建设上的大力来打魔鬼的嘴巴。士敏土是一种有力的结合原料。我们要用士敏土来完成共和国伟大的建设。我们就是士敏土，同志们：劳动阶级。……”
      “用大力建设来打魔鬼的嘴巴”，“将劳动阶级作为士敏土来建设共和国”，这就是苏联要从新经济政策过渡到社会主义建设的道路。格利从这一思想出发，甚至宽恕了旧日把他送交白军军官去处死的一个仇人——工程师克利思特，争取他为重建工厂而服务，并称他为共和国的一个伟大的工程师。工人阶级的这种伟大胸怀，在这一件事的描写上，也特别显得动人而可爱。
    但工厂的重建并不是容易的：必须跟官僚主义者和贪污、浪费者进行坚决的斗争，跟土匪的破坏进行战争，跟一切旧的习惯势力进行斗争。最后，自然是格利取得了胜利。它象征着新经济政策穿过一切障碍而前进了。全部问题是在于恢复工厂为了使国家得进入于社会主义的生活，同时，人也得到了社会主义的改造。
    接着而来的是苏联进入社会主义的大建设时代，劳动已成为作家的广泛的主题。苏联作家从各个不同的角度，来描写苏联劳动人民的艰苦奋斗精神。这在卡达耶夫的“时间呀，前进！”中就可以分明地看到的。
    卡达耶夫以巨大的篇幅，来写士敏土工厂中二十四小时内的工作和行动。在这里，已不是对官僚主义、生活的不安与骚动进行斗争，而是前进的思想和保守落后的思想间的斗争；已经不是对经济的破坏进行斗争，而是如何组织竞赛，迅速建设社会主义的斗争了。建设中的速度问题就提到工人阶级的面前来了。这里，有两个显明的对照的形象：那就是麦加利和纳尔盆杜夫。麦加利是一个严格的、细心的、头脑很精细的人。他能够依靠工人的积极分子——伊舒勤珂班，与哈尔科夫城的士敏土工人进行竞赛，并在全厂内以重点示范的方法，提高劳动速率。他真正是懂得领导艺术和如何建设社会主义祖国的布尔什维克的形象。而纳尔盆杜夫则是一个缺乏热情、善于“听取报告和发布命令”的人，是一个根据所谓“正确的法则和知识”而行事的人；但他却离开实际，不感到工人的创造热情，专门嫉妒麦加利被人尊为最好的首长，并且认为任何一种加强工作速度的企图，都是一种“奸雄主义”，认为那不是在“建设”，而是在“竞技”。显然地，这样的思想与精神是不适合于社会主义建设的要求的。胜利自然还是属于麦加利方面。卡达耶夫在这小说中所提出的主题思想，到了苏联第二个五年计划的后期，就出现了斯大哈诺夫运动。这一运动，在其本质上，就是发展和运用工人的技术经验，大胆地推进首倡精神，来打破“墨守陈规”的技术观点，来加速社会主义的建设。与这同时，工人阶级的精神品质也升高了，变成为真正的自然的主人了。我们也许可以这样说：在这以后，在苏联文学中有关于劳动的题材的作品，都几乎沿着这一主题思想而发展：我们在它们那里，越来越多的看到苏联人民精神生活的丰满，道德品质的崇高。
    “时间呀，前进！”成为苏联当时建设社会主义的重要口号。很难想像：苏联人民没有经过将近三个五年计划的社会主义的建设，而能在对德国法西斯的战争中取得如此辉煌的胜利的；而没有这一辉煌的胜利，而能在今天建立起以苏联为首的强大的世界和平、民主、社会主义的阵营的。这一阵营，正是苏联人民以他们的劳动力量作为结合原料——士敏土——而建立起来的全世界和平人民的最坚强的堡垒。斯大林的英明的远见就在于此。同时，正如我们的党和毛主席所不断教导我们的，很难想像：没有苏联反法西斯战争的伟大胜利，我国人民能如此迅速地取得解放战争的胜利；没有这些年来苏联对我国的无私帮助，我国经济能在短短三年中如此迅速恢复，抗美援朝的斗争能获得如此辉煌的成就。而这一切，就不能不使我们想到苏联人民的劳动所创造的伟大力量。
    根据我国政府代表团和苏联政府所商谈的苏联援助我国发展国民经济的结果：连同过去三年来帮助我国设计的企业在内，至一九五九年止，苏联将援助我国新建和改建一百四十一项规模巨大的企业，由苏联进行设计并对建设和改建九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业，给以系统的经济的和技术的援助。这一事实，就充分表现了我们仿佛用手可以摸到的苏联人民那种无私的英雄胸怀，那像太阳一样地抚育大地的英雄胸怀，那为“全世界无产阶级联合起来”的思想所培育壮大的英雄胸怀。学习苏联人民的刻苦、勤劳、坚毅和大胆的首倡精神的英雄行动吧！我们只有把每一分钱节省下来用之于我们国家的社会主义工业化的建设，我们才不辜负苏联人民以他们血汗劳动所创造的技术、设备与智慧所给我们的援助。我相信，我国的劳动人民将在自己国家的社会主义工业化的建设过程中，成长得像苏联的人民一样，而且在我国的文学作品中得到光辉的反映。
