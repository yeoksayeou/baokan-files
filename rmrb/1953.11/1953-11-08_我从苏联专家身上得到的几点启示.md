Some Enlightenment I Received from Soviet Experts
Ma Benyin

I am a technician and recently participated in the design work for the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Center project. Three Soviet experts led this design work, and I served as a translator for one of them. During the two months of work, whether in calculation and drawing, in work attitude, or in concern for the people, I received many new inspirations from the Soviet experts. I felt that the sincere opinions and valuable experiences of the Soviet experts were extremely useful to us. Cherishing these experiences and opinions will enable us to better complete the tasks assigned to us by the motherland in the economic construction of the country. Now, I will briefly describe the help that Soviet experts gave us in the design work and how they corrected our past mistakes, divided into several issues as follows:

I. On the Issue of Soil. In the past, we often considered soil separately from the above-ground structure. If we found cracks in the structure, we blamed the soil without considering whether there were any shortcomings in our design. Many people said that the soil in Beijing was not good and often moved the location of buildings because of soil problems. Soviet experts believe that there are many ancient Chinese buildings in Beijing, such as the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Summer Palace, and the Tianning Temple Pagoda, etc. These buildings have hundreds of years of history, but they still exist intact. Facts prove that the soil in Beijing is not bad. The soil problems encountered in a certain building should not be separated from the overall environment around it and evaluated independently. Soil problems should be considered as a whole with the above-ground building. If the soil is poor, the engineer should find ways to design the above-ground building to be more robust. When the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Center design project began, some Chinese engineers complained that the soil was not good and advocated using caissons and piling for the foundation. However, the Soviet expert suggested digging several pits on the construction site to test it. He personally used his eyes and hands to contact the soil and, after testing and research, believed that it was not necessary to use caissons or piling. He suggested using a box-shaped foundation for the central hall area and a strip foundation for the two wings areas. And he explained the calculation methods for these two types of foundations to the comrades very clearly. In the past, we often used the calculation method of inverted beams to calculate strip foundations, which resulted in a large moment. He used the calculation method of an elastic foundation, and the resulting moment value was about two-thirds less than the previous algorithm, proving that our past calculation method was backward. This incident taught us that if we can more genuinely consider soil problems and more accurately assess the bearing capacity of the soil, then there is no doubt that we will use all building materials more rationally and save a lot of national wealth.

II. On the Issue of Replacing Reinforced Concrete Frame Structures with Brick and Stone Structures. According to Soviet experts, general buildings in the Soviet Union, such as schools, dormitories, nurseries, and office buildings, are made of brick and stone. This can save a lot of steel and concrete, and the use of brick and stone structures can also make the building achieve great rigidity and avoid settlement. In the past, when we designed three- or four-story buildings, we often liked to use reinforced concrete frame structures. Construction was troublesome, and it required a large amount of steel, concrete, and formwork, which was simply a huge waste. Soviet experts believe that in frame structures, filling the spaces between columns and between upper and lower beams with brick and stone not only fails to exert their bearing capacity but also increases the weight of the structure. So why not let the brick and stone become the main load-bearing structure? In the Soviet Union, brick and stone structures can be used in buildings with more than ten floors. If reinforced concrete tie beams are added to the bottom of each floor slab or steel mesh is placed in two rows of bricks, the rigidity will be increased even more. This novel design method can help us save a lot of cement and steel.

III. In terms of drawing, Soviet experts provided many valuable suggestions on the preparation of structural drawings. He often said: Construction workers are the most important force in engineering. It is the workers who turn the planes and sections on the drawings into real objects. Technicians should respect workers, consider them in every way, and serve them well. Therefore, the drawings should be clear to avoid difficulties for the workers during work. In the past, our drawing methods were chaotic and did not have a unified standard. For example, when drawing arrowheads at both ends of dimension lines, for the sake of beauty, we only slightly thickened the original line at both ends, which was neither like an arrow nor like a dot. Also, some dimension numbers were written to the left, some to the right, and some even upside down, which sometimes required turning the drawing 180 degrees to see the numbers clearly. Soviet experts helped us correct these errors. He said that dimension numbers are the most important thing on construction drawings, so they should be written large and in ink. There should not be redundant dimensions on the drawings. For example, if the distance between the column axes has been noted, then the dimensions between the column surfaces should not be noted again. There are many dimensions on the drawings, but many are redundant. The opening elevation on the section drawing should only note the bottom edge elevation of the opening. The beam and slab elevation in the section drawing can be noted on the bottom surface of the beam and slab, because the carpenters only need the bottom surface elevation of the beam and slab when making the formwork. Soviet experts also proposed using formwork plan drawings so that carpenters can prepare the formwork according to this drawing without having to search for the dimensions they need in other drawings. Also, each drawing has a steel bar schedule and a steel bar and concrete quantity table. The steel bar schedule lists the type, shape, diameter, total length, and number of steel bars. Comrades on the construction site can bend the steel bars according to this table without having to find the dimensions in the sectional drawings. The steel bar and concrete quantity table indicates the tonnage of steel bars and the quantity of concrete, and comrades in the construction unit can prepare the materials according to this table. Soviet experts also taught us to unify the representative symbols on the drawings. These suggestions are very reasonable.

IV. In terms of reasonable use of materials and saving materials, Soviet experts said: All building materials are the wealth of the people. Engineers themselves should understand that they are also members of the people and have a responsibility to save the wealth of the people. In this work, Soviet experts thinned many brick walls. When he saw a kind of rubble on the construction site, he immediately discussed with the comrades on the construction site whether this kind of rubble could be obtained and which was more economical compared with pebbles? Where is the rubble produced? Is it close to the construction site? After all these questions were resolved and the investigation results proved that using this kind of rubble was both good and economical, he decided to use this kind of rubble in the project, saving a lot of concrete for the project and greatly reducing the work of the concrete mixer. Also, in the past, the ventilation pipes in the equipment were made of galvanized iron sheets. This time, materials such as sugarcane boards were used instead. He said that galvanized iron sheets should be saved. When he saw empty cement bags on the construction site, he asked the comrades on the construction site how they could be reused. This spirit of saving wealth for the people everywhere is what we should learn from.

V. In terms of caring for the people and cherishing labor, Soviet experts demonstrated even more outstanding qualities. He felt very uneasy when he saw workers digging soil in the water on the construction site, so he suggested that the water be drained first before allowing the workers to dig soil. When he discussed the preparations for winter construction with the comrades, he carefully considered the issue of cotton clothing for the workers during winter construction. Also, a certain intern comrade drew many redundant parts on the drawing. He felt that engineers should not only let intern comrades draw drawings but also teach them how to draw drawings. The labor of a comrade should be cherished, and drawings should also be cherished because they are the result of labor. An architect asked Soviet experts for opinions on the draft of a certain theater he designed. After the expert read it, he said that the theater is a place for the working people to rest and should be designed to be beautiful, comfortable, and with sufficient air. He saw that the depth of the upper level in the draft was very long and felt that this was an embarrassing thing for the comrades sitting in the back row downstairs. He said that the ceiling should also be decorated with artistic colors and patterns of Chinese national style. He believes that, in some cases, architectural art is more important than other arts such as painting, because if a painting is not beautiful, people can choose not to look at it, but if a building is designed badly, it cannot be rolled up or covered up. It will continue to leave a bad impression on people for a long time and destroy the overall beauty of the city. He said that if the people do not like our works, then we should be ashamed. Soviet experts attach great importance to criticism. He said that they do not care about face or fear embarrassment. Caring about face can only bring us mistakes, and criticism and self-criticism can help comrades progress. At the construction site, he repeatedly asked comrades to give him opinions. He said that this is completely necessary for work. He emphasized the spirit of collective creation. He said that a person always makes mistakes, but the collective is always right. When he discussed problems with the comrades at the construction site, he always listened to the opinions of the Chinese comrades first, then put forward his own opinions, and asked the comrades to discuss his opinions. He said that Chinese comrades should not expect to get all the solutions from him, but should use their brains first. He assists in this way, so that the Chinese comrades will improve their skills after this project; otherwise, if he solves all the problems alone, the Chinese comrades will not benefit from the work. He said that he is also learning from the Chinese workers. As long as there is a desire to learn, this person can progress. Soviet experts fully demonstrated the spirit of caring for the people, caring for comrades, helping comrades, and humbly learning in design review and problem discussion. This spirit deeply moved every comrade who had contact with him. At the same time, it educated us and made us realize that to be an engineer of the people, we not only need to improve our professional level, but also need to have a completely clear and comprehensive understanding of other aspects, such as the spirit of being responsible to the people, caring for the people, and saving the wealth of the people, so that we can better serve the economic construction of the motherland.

    我从苏联专家身上得到的几点启示
    马本寅
    我是一个技术人员，最近参加了北京苏联展览馆工程的设计工作。领导这个设计工作的有三位苏联专家，我给其中的一位担任翻译。在两个月工作过程中，不论在计算和绘图方面，在工作态度以及对人民的关怀等方面，我都从苏联专家那里得到了不少新的启示。我感到苏联专家诚挚的意见和宝贵的经验对我们是太有用了。珍视这些经验和意见，我们将会在祖国经济建设中更好地完成祖国给予我们的任务。现在我把苏联专家在设计工作中对我们的帮助以及如何纠正我们过去的错误等情形，分成几个问题略述如下：
    一、对土壤问题。我们过去往往将土壤与地面上的结构分开来考虑，如果发现结构物发生裂缝，即归罪于土壤，而不考虑是否自己在设计上有缺点。不少的人都说北京的土壤不好，往往为了土壤问题而将建筑物位置移动。苏联专家认为：北京有很多中国的古代建筑物，如故宫、天坛、颐和园和天宁寺塔等等，这类建筑物已有数百年的历史了，但至今仍然完整地存在着。事实证明，北京的土壤并不坏。不应该将某一建筑中所遇到的土壤问题从其四周的环境整体中割离出来，单独地来鉴定它。土壤问题应该和地面上的建筑作为整体来加以考虑，如土壤较差，则工程师应该设法将地面上的建筑设计得更坚固。北京苏联展览馆设计工程开始时，有些中国工程师嫌土壤不好，对于基础主张用沉井及打桩的方法，但苏联专家建议在工地试掘几个坑，他亲自用自己的眼和手去与土壤接触，并经过化验和研究后，认为不必用沉井、打桩的方法，他建议在中央大厅一部分采用箱形基础，而在二翼地区采用带形基础。并且把这二种基础的计算方法向同志们作了很清楚的解释。过去我们算带形基础往往用反梁的计算方法，力矩很大；他用弹性地基的计算方法，所得力矩值较前一种算法少三分之二左右，证明我们过去的计算方法已落后了。这件事教训我们，我们如能更真切地来考虑土壤问题，如能更准确地来鉴定土壤的承重能力，那毫无疑问将会更合理地来使用一切建筑材料，并可节省大量的国家财富。
    二、对钢筋混凝土框架结构改用砖石结构的问题。据苏联专家介绍，苏联一般建筑如学校、宿舍、托儿所、办公楼等等皆是用砖石做的，这样可以节省许多钢筋及混凝土，而且利用砖石结构也能使建筑物达到很大的刚度而避免沉降。我们过去设计三、四层的楼房时，往往喜欢采用钢筋混凝土框架结构，施工既麻烦，又需要数量甚多的钢筋、混凝土及模板等，这简直是很大的浪费。苏联专家认为框架结构中，在柱间，上下梁间填以砖石，这些砖石非但不能发挥其承重能力，反而加重了结构的重量。因此为什么不让砖石变成承重的结构主体呢？在苏联，砖石结构能应用于十层以上的建筑物中，如能在每层楼板底面处另加钢筋混凝土箍梁或者在二排砖中安置钢筋网，则其刚度又增加不少。这一新颖的设计方法，可以帮助我们节省不少的水泥和钢筋。
    三、在绘图方面，苏联专家对结构图的绘制上提供了不少的宝贵意见。他常常说：建筑工人是工程中最主要的力量，正是工人们将图纸上的平面、剖面变成了实物，技术人员应该尊重工人，处处为工人设想，好好为工人服务，因此，出图要清楚，以免工人们在工作时发生困难。过去我们在绘图方式上是混乱的，没有一个统一的标准。如画尺寸线二端箭头时，为了美观，只在二端将原线稍稍加粗即算完事，既不像箭头亦不像圆点，又如尺寸数字有的向左写，有的向右写，甚至于向上倒写，因而有时势必将图纸转一百八十度角后才能看清数字。苏联专家帮助我们纠正了这些错误，他说尺寸数字是施工图上最主要的东西，因此要写得大，并应上墨。图纸上不应有多余的尺寸，如柱轴线间的距离已注明后，则柱面间的尺寸即不应再注，图纸上尺寸甚多，但却有许多是多余的。剖面图上开口标高只注开口底边标高，剖面图中梁板标高注在梁板底面即可，因木工同志做模板时，他只需要梁板底面标高。苏联专家又提议采用模板平面图，使木工同志能按照本图准备模板，不用在其他图中去寻找他所需的尺寸。又如在每一张图中附有钢筋表及钢筋与混凝土数量表，钢筋表中列明钢筋种类、形状、直径、总长度、根数等。工地同志可按照此表弯钢筋，用不着在剖面图中去找尺寸；钢筋及混凝土数量表内注明钢筋吨数及混凝土数量，施工单位同志可按此表准备材料。苏联专家还教我们在图纸上统一了代表符号。这些意见都是很合理的。
    四、在合理使用材料及节省材料方面，苏联专家说：所有一切建筑材料皆是人民的财富，工程师自己应明了自己也是人民中的一员，有责任节省人民的财富。在这次工作中，苏联专家将许多砖墙都改薄了。他在工地看见一种块石，即马上与工地同志商量，是否能得到这类块石，与卵石相较，何种较经济？块石产在何处？离工地近不近？待所有这些问题皆得到了解决，调查结果，证明用这种块石又好又省，他便决定在工程中利用此类块石，为工程节省了大量的混凝土，并大大地减轻了混凝土搅拌机工作。又如过去设备方面的通风管皆用白铁皮来做，这次改用了甘蔗板之类的材料，他说白铁皮应该节省。他在工地看到空的水泥袋时，便问工地同志如何能再利用。这种处处为人民节省财富的精神，是我们应该好好学习的。
    五、在对人民的关怀及对劳动力的爱惜方面，更表现了苏联专家的优秀品质。他在工地看见工人在水中掘土，感到非常不安，因而建议先将水抽干，然后才能让工人同志们掘土。他在与同志们商量冬季施工准备工作时，很仔细地考虑到工人同志冬季施工的棉衣问题。又如有一位实习生同志画的图有许多地方是多余的，他感觉到工程师同志不应该光让实习生同志画图，而应该教他如何画图，对一个同志的劳动应该珍惜，对图纸也应该爱护，因为这是劳动的成果。有一位建筑师将其所设计之某剧院草图请苏联专家提意见，专家看了以后说，剧场是劳动人民来休息的场所，应该设计得美观，舒适，空气要充足。他看见草图上楼座深度很长，认为这对坐在楼下后排的同志是一件难堪的事。他说，天花板上亦应该用中国民族形式的艺术色彩和花纹来点缀。他认为，在某种情况下，建筑艺术较其他艺术如绘画等更重要，因为一张画如画得不美，人民可以不看它，但一个建筑物如设计坏了，那它不能被卷上或覆盖起来，它将在一个长时间内继续留给人民一个坏的印象，并破坏了城市的整体美。他说，如果人民不喜爱我们的作品，那我们是应该引为耻辱的。苏联专家很重视批评，他说他们不讲面子，也不怕难为情，讲面子只能带给我们错误，批评与自我批评才能帮助同志进步。他在工地，反复地要求同志们向他提意见，他说，为了工作这是完全应该的。他强调集体创作精神，他说，一个人总是要犯错误的，但集体永远是对的；他在工地与同志们讨论问题时，也总是先倾听中国同志的意见，然后提出自己的意见，并要求同志们讨论他的意见。他说中国同志不应该期望着由他那里得到所有的解决方法，而应该自己先动用脑筋，他从中协助，这样中国同志经过此次工程后，技术上又提高了；要不然，光由他一个人将所有问题都解决了，那中国同志在工作中是得不到好处的。他说，他也在向中国工人弟兄们学习，只要有欲望肯学习，这个人是能进步的。苏联专家在审核设计，讨论问题中完全表现了关怀人民、关怀同志、帮助同志和虚心学习的精神，这种精神深深感动了每一个与他接触过的同志。同时也教育了我们，使我们了解到做一个人民的工程师，不单单要提高业务水平，同时在其他各方面，如对人民负责的精神，关怀人民，节省人民的财富等问题上，都需要有一个完全清楚和全面的认识，才能更好地为祖国的经济建设服务。
