Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd—The Second National Juvenile and Children Work Conference convened by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League opened in Beijing on November 2nd. Commander-in-Chief Zhu attended the opening ceremony and delivered a speech. The conference was attended by juvenile and children work cadres from all levels of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, outstanding counselors from Young Pioneer teams across the country, and work cadres from juvenile and children's newspapers and periodicals, children's palaces, children's homes, and other organizations, totaling more than 300 people.

The conference was declared open by Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Commander-in-Chief Zhu then delivered a speech.

Commander-in-Chief Zhu first pointed out: All great revolutionary teachers, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Comrade Mao Zedong, loved and cared for children, because children are the future hope of mankind, and when they grow up, they will be the builders of society and the successors of the revolutionary cause. Commander-in-Chief Zhu also pointed out: Cultivating and educating the new generation is a glorious and arduous task. Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: I hope everyone can take on this work with the greatest enthusiasm and cultivate our new generation into people with strong physiques, who are lively, brave, honest, love labor, love learning, love the motherland, and are rich in collectivist spirit. Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: To become a good children's education worker in the new era, one must first make one's own ideology, work style, and political and cultural cultivation a model for children, and use one's own exemplary behavior to influence children. Finally, Commander-in-Chief Zhu instructed juvenile and children workers that they must implement the spirit of the general line of our motherland's gradual transition to socialism in their work, and guide the nation's children to aspire to be outstanding laborers building the socialist motherland. After Commander-in-Chief Zhu finished speaking, representatives of the Young Pioneers and counselors presented flowers to Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Everyone was deeply moved by the Chinese Communist Party's affectionate care for children. The entire audience rose several times, and there was warm applause.

Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, delivered a report entitled "Cultivating New People of Socialism." He first described the achievements of juvenile and children work in the past four years, saying: There are now 7 million Young Pioneers across the country. The Young Pioneer organization has cooperated with schools to carry out patriotic ideological education and knowledge education, and has also launched cultural, sports, and social work activities, expanding children's horizons, enriching children's knowledge, and inspiring children's consciousness and creativity. The active role of the Young Pioneers in schools is becoming increasingly significant and has become an organization loved by the vast majority of children. Next, Hu Keshi pointed out that the main task of juvenile and children work in the future is to educate children in the spirit of communism, and cultivate them into a new generation that loves the motherland, loves the people, loves science, loves labor, and cherishes public property, so that they can inherit the great cause of the motherland and support the banner of socialism and communism to the final victory. Finally, Hu Keshi emphasized that Youth League organizations at all levels must strengthen their leadership over juvenile and children work, strengthen the training of Young Pioneer counselors, and strengthen ties with relevant departments, schools, families, and all aspects of society. He called on all juvenile and children workers to strengthen their study in order to complete the glorious task entrusted by the Chinese Communist Party.

During the conference, Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions and Hu Keshi's work report will be discussed, and experiences in juvenile and children work in various places will be exchanged, and outstanding counselors of Young Pioneer organizations in various places will be commended.

The First National Juvenile and Children Work Conference was held in April 1950. Before that, in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party entrusted the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to establish the Chinese Children's Team (now renamed "Chinese Young Pioneers"). The First National Juvenile and Children Work Conference determined the direction and tasks of juvenile and children work. In the past four years, under the kind care of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, juvenile and children work has achieved great success. Now, the motherland has entered a new period of gradual transition to socialist society and has begun the first five-year construction plan, which will open up a bright future for the happy life of our country's children; at the same time, the motherland also requires that children be cultivated into new types of people who build socialism and communism. Therefore, this conference will discuss how the Youth League and juvenile and children workers can further strengthen juvenile and children work in all aspects; how to carry out activities in many ways according to the age characteristics of children, so as to cooperate with schools to better shoulder the glorious task of educating and cultivating the new generation.

    朱总司令号召引导少年儿童立志做社会主义祖国的优秀建设者
    【新华社二日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会召开的第二次全国少年儿童工作会议于十一月二日在北京开幕。朱总司令出席了开幕式，在会上讲话。出席这次会议的有中国新民主主义青年团各级组织的少年儿童工作干部，各地少年先锋队的优秀辅导员以及各地少年儿童报刊和少年宫、少年之家等组织的工作干部共三百多人。
    会议在中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记胡耀邦主持下宣布开幕后，朱总司令讲话。
    朱总司令首先指出：所有伟大革命导师马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东同志都是爱护和关心儿童的，这是因为儿童是人类未来的希望，他们长大以后，就是社会的建设者和革命事业的继承人。朱总司令并指出：培养和教育新生的一代是光荣的同时也是艰巨的任务。朱总司令说：我希望大家能以最大的热情来担负这个工作，把我国新生的一代培养成有健壮体质的、活泼、勇敢、诚实、爱劳动、爱学习、爱祖国和富有集体主义精神的人。朱总司令说：要在新时代里成为一个良好的儿童教育工作者，必须首先使自己的思想作风、政治文化修养能成为儿童的榜样，要用自己的模范行为去影响儿童。最后朱总司令指示少年儿童工作者们必须把我们祖国逐步过渡到社会主义时期的总路线的精神，贯彻在自己的工作中，引导全国的少年儿童立志做建设社会主义祖国的优秀劳动者。朱总司令讲话毕，中国少年先锋队队员和辅导员代表向朱总司令献花，大家都为中国共产党对少年儿童的亲切关怀而深深感动，全场数度起立，响起了热烈的掌声。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实在会上作了题为“培养社会主义的新人”的报告。他首先叙述四年来少年儿童工作的成绩说：全国现在已有少年先锋队队员七百万人，少年先锋队组织配合学校进行了爱国主义思想教育和知识教育，并展开了文化、体育、社会工作等活动，扩大了少年儿童的眼界，丰富了少年儿童的知识，启发了少年儿童的自觉性与创造精神。少年先锋队在学校中的积极作用日益显著，并已成为广大少年儿童所热爱的组织。接着，胡克实指出今后少年儿童工作的主要任务是以共产主义精神教育少年儿童，培养他们成为爱祖国、爱人民、爱科学、爱劳动、爱护公共财物的健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实的新的一代，以继承祖国的伟大事业，把社会主义和共产主义的旗帜撑持到最终的胜利。最后，胡克实着重指出：青年团的各级组织必须加强对少年儿童工作的领导，加强对少年先锋队辅导员的培养与训练，并加强与有关部门、学校、家庭、社会各方面的联系。他号召全体少年儿童工作者加强学习，以完成中国共产党交托的光荣任务。
    会议期间，将讨论朱总司令的指示和胡克实的工作报告，并交流各地少年儿童工作经验，表扬各地少年先锋队组织的优秀辅导员。
    第一次全国少年儿童工作会议曾在一九五○年四月举行。在这之前，一九四九年，中国共产党委托中国新民主主义青年团建立了中国少年儿童队（现已改名为“中国少年先锋队”）。第一次全国少年儿童工作会议确定了少年儿童工作的方针和任务。四年来，在中国共产党和毛主席亲切关怀下，少年儿童工作已获得很大成绩。现在，祖国已进入了逐步过渡到社会主义社会的新时期，并已开始了第一个五年建设计划，这将为我国少年儿童的幸福生活开辟美好的前途；同时祖国也要求把少年儿童培养成为建设社会主义和共产主义的新型的人物。因此，这次会议将讨论青年团和少年儿童工作者如何进一步从各方面加强少年儿童工作；如何根据少年儿童的年龄特点，从多方面开展活动，以便配合学校更好地担负起教育和培养新生一代的光荣任务。（附图片）
