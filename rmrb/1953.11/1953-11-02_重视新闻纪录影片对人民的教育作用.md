Short commentary:

    News documentary films are an important part of the people's film art事业. With a concise and truthful artistic style, they report major events at home and abroad to the audience; with "visualized political commentary," they conduct patriotism and internationalism education to the audience. Outstanding news documentary films produced in our country, such as “Red Flag Waves West Wind,” “Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River,” “Triumphant Song of the Great Southwest,” “Resist America, Aid Korea” Episode 1, “Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities,” “Light Shines on Tibet,” “National Day of 1952,” “We Must Harness the Huai River,” “Happy Xinjiang,” etc., have been warmly welcomed by the vast audience in various places.

    Many film distribution units, cinemas, and film projection teams have political enthusiasm for showing news documentary films, and their work has been very successful. However, many film distribution workers, film projectionists, especially cinema staff, still quite generally have the idea of not paying attention to the work of showing news documentary films. They have a "business" viewpoint, disregard the political education role of some major news documentary films for the people, and think that only feature films can "sell tickets," and news documentary films are "second-class goods" and "filler material." Some film distribution agencies backlog news documentary films in warehouses. For example, the China Film Distribution Company's Henan Provincial Office has a backlog of 16mm film copies, the vast majority of which are brand new news documentary films. Many cinemas and projection teams regard showing news documentaries as a kind of "burden" and a "money-losing business," so they are unwilling to show news documentary films or request to show them for fewer days. Some cinemas, when showing feature films, are unwilling to show newsreels in order to add more shows and make more money. Recently, individual cinemas in Fuzhou refused to show the news documentary "Exchange of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War." When the Fuzhou Cultural Palace Cinema showed the Soviet feature film "The Fall of Berlin" (Parts 1 and 2), it arbitrarily removed the first and third reels of the accompanying "Exchange of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War", only showing the second reel, leaving the audience confused after watching it. Some cinemas in Lanzhou only showed the Soviet documentary "Lenin Canal" and the Chinese documentary "Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project" for one day, and then requested to replace them with other films the next day. They do this because they generally and subjectively believe that news documentary films are "boring" and "audiences don't like to watch them."

    Our news documentary films have achieved great success in creation, but some films do have shortcomings. In the future, the creators of news documentary films should continuously improve the ideological and artistic quality of the films, overcome the shortcomings of some news documentaries, such as weak ideology, insufficient artistic generalization, loose structure, rigidness, and generality, so that the films themselves are not only clear and easy to understand, can play a greater educational role for the audience, but also novel and lively in artistic style, which is very important. However, we cannot therefore conclude that "audiences do not like to watch news documentaries." The screening results of many news documentary films show that this "conclusion" is very one-sided. By the end of June this year, the screening of the first episode of "Resist America, Aid Korea" had an audience of more than 40 million; the audiences of "The Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China" each had more than 14 million. In Jiangxi, Hebei and other places, due to the good publicity and organization of the audience, the audience of news documentary films has greatly increased, and the screening effect is good. The facts show that the majority of the audience does not dislike watching news documentaries, but rather that some film distributors and projectionists do not publicize and organize the audience when screening documentaries, and treat this work with a passive attitude. Some film distribution agencies do not strengthen the publicity and organization work of films from a positive perspective for the distribution work of news documentary films, but rather take simple and administrative methods to arrange the screening of news documentary films, attempting to force the audience to watch news documentary films, which is naturally incorrect.

    In order to strengthen the educational role of news documentary films for the broad masses of people, while gradually improving the quality of news documentaries, film distribution workers and projectionists should attach importance to the publicity and organization of the audience for news documentary films, give full play to their initiative and creativity, and carry out extensive and diverse publicity to the audience in order to change the current situation where many people do not pay attention to news documentary films.

### 重视新闻纪录影片对人民的教育作用

    重视新闻纪录影片对人民的教育作用
    新闻纪录影片是人民电影艺术事业的一个重要部分。它以简明信实的艺术样式，向观众报道国内外的重大事件；以“形象化的政论”，向观众进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育。我国出品的
  “红旗漫卷西风”、“百万雄师下江南”、“大西南凯歌”、“抗美援朝”第一集、“中国民族大团结”、“光明照耀着西藏”、“一九五二年国庆节”、“一定要把淮河修好”、“欢乐的新疆”等优秀的新闻纪录影片，都受到各地广大观众的热烈欢迎。
    许多电影发行单位、电影院和电影放映队对放映新闻纪录影片是有政治热情的，他们的工作很有成绩。但也有不少电影发行工作人员、电影放映员，尤其影院工作人员，还相当普遍地存在着不重视放映新闻纪录影片工作的思想。他们有“生意经”观点，无视若干重大的新闻纪录影片对人民的政治教育作用，认为只有故事影片才能“卖座”，新闻纪录影片是“次等货”，是“补垫材料”。有的电影发行机构，将新闻纪录影片积压在仓库里。如中国电影发行公司河南省办事处所积压的十六粍的电影拷贝中，极大部分是全新的新闻纪录影片。不少电影院、放映队把放映新闻纪录片看作是种“负担”，是“赔钱买卖”，因此不愿放映新闻纪录影片或要求少放几天。有的影院上映故事影片时，为了多加场数，多卖钱，不愿加映新闻周报。最近福州市的个别影院曾拒绝加映新闻纪录片“交换病伤战俘”。福州市文化宫电影院在放映苏联故事影片“攻克柏林”上下集时，将加映的“交换病伤战俘”，擅自抽掉第一、三两本，只放映了第二本，使观众看后莫明其妙。兰州市的某些影院，在放映苏联纪录片“列宁运河”和中国纪录片“荆江分洪”时，仅放映一天，第二天就要求另换其他影片放映。他们所以这样，是因为他们笼统地、主观地认为新闻纪录影片
  “枯燥无味”、“观众不喜欢看”。
    我们的新闻纪录影片在创作上是有很大的成就，但有些影片也确有缺点，今后新闻纪录影片的创作人员，应不断提高影片的思想性和艺术性，克服有些新闻纪录片中思想性不强、艺术概括性不够、结构松懈、呆板、一般化等缺点，使影片本身不但明白易懂，能对观众起更大的教育作用，而且在艺术风格上新颖活泼，这是很重要的。但不能因此就得出结论说：“观众不喜爱看新闻纪录片。”不少新闻纪录片的放映成绩，说明了这种“结论”是带有很大的片面性的。“抗美援朝”第一集的放映，到今年六月底，观众有四千多万人次；“中国人民的胜利”和“解放了的中国”的观众各有一千四百多万人次。江西、河北等地，由于作好了宣传和组织观众的工作，新闻纪录影片的观众有很大增加，映出效果良好。事实说明广大观众不是不喜欢看新闻纪录片，而是有些电影发行人员、放映人员在放映纪录片时，不去宣传、组织观众，以消极的态度对待这项工作。有的电影发行机构对于新闻纪录片的发行工作，不是从积极方面加强影片的宣传、组织工作，而是采取简单的、行政的方式，去安排新闻纪录影片的放映，企图迫使观众去看新闻纪录影片，这样做自然是不对的。
    为了加强新闻纪录影片对广大人民的教育作用，在逐步提高新闻纪录片质量的同时，电影发行工作人员、放映员应重视新闻纪录影片的宣传和组织观众的工作，发挥主动性和创造性，向观众进行广泛的、多样的宣传，以改变目前许多人不重视新闻纪录影片的情况。
