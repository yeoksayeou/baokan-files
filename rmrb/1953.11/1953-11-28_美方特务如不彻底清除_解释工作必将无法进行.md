The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission announced on November 23rd that the Indian Custodial Forces had intercepted a secret directive on November 8th from U.S., ROK, and Chiang Kai-shek agents, Park Dong-hyuk, to the special agents in the Tongchang-ri POW camp from Syngman Rhee, Won Yong-duk, and Wang Dong-yuan. In the past two months, the Indian Custodial Forces have intercepted many similar secret letters from special agents. The published directive is sufficient to expose the entire criminal scheme of U.S. agents controlling the POW camps.

The facts revealed in this secret directive prove that the special agent organization in the Tongchang-ri POW camp was under the overall deployment of the U.S. military and directly commanded by the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs. A large number of Rhee and Chiang agents directly controlled the entire Tongchang-ri POW camp, with the U.S. 64th Field "Hospital" serving as the general liaison station for special agent activities. These U.S., Rhee, and Chiang agents frequently traveled between the POW camp and Seoul, receiving instructions from Seoul and Taipei, and conducting frantic sabotage activities within the Tongchang-ri POW camp. They brutally murdered POWs who requested repatriation and disrupted the explanation work in an attempt to achieve the U.S. goal of forcibly detaining POWs. The U.S. propaganda machine repeatedly publicized the U.S. victory in the "psychological warfare" against the POWs and continuously smeared the Korean and Chinese side for delaying the explanation work, attempting to cover up the U.S. sabotage activities. However, the secret directive of the U.S., Rhee, and Chiang sides intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces not only makes it impossible for the U.S. to deny its special agent crimes, but also completely bankrupts all the U.S. rumors and slanders against the Korean and Chinese side.

Our side has repeatedly pointed out that the special agent organizations controlling POWs in the Neutral Nations Custodial Camps were painstakingly established by the U.S. over a long period of time and were moved intact from U.S. POW camps in Geoje Island and elsewhere to the neutral zone camps. Before the POWs were handed over to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the U.S. made extremely detailed arrangements to continue preserving these special agent organizations. After the Indian Custodial Forces took over, these special agent organizations continued to implement extremely strict terrorist rule over the POWs and actively planned to disrupt the explanation work according to the plans of the U.S., Rhee, and Chiang sides. At that time, our side proposed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission the proposal to eliminate the special agents and disrupt the original organization of the POW camps, but it failed to materialize due to U.S. obstruction. After the explanation work began, these special agent organizations made many unreasonable demands to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and special agent leaders posing as so-called "POW representatives" ran amok, constantly threatening POWs, preventing them from listening to explanations, and continuously abusing and killing POWs who requested repatriation. All of this not only caused great difficulties for the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces, but also forced the explanation work to be interrupted five times, and it still cannot be resumed.

In the 44 days since the explanation work began, the Korean and Chinese side has continuously made significant efforts to complete the explanation work stipulated in the "Terms of Reference," but each time the explanation work was restored, it was immediately sabotaged by special agents directed by the U.S. Taking November as an example, after our efforts enabled the explanation work to resume on November 3rd, the special agents directed by the U.S. adopted new sabotage tactics, resulting in the Korean and Chinese side only explaining to some POWs in Camp 28 on the 4th. On the 5th, the special agents in this camp controlled the POWs who had not listened to the explanations and prevented them from leaving the camp. In order to take into account the difficulty of the Indian Custodial Forces in identifying these POWs who had not listened to the explanations, our side changed to Camp 22 for explanation, but because the Chiang bandit agents in this camp adopted the same methods as Camp 28 and did not allow any POWs to leave the camp, the explanation work was forced to be interrupted again from the 6th. In order to take into account the difficulties of the Indian Custodial Forces and to quickly restore the explanation work, our side made new efforts and changed to explaining to POWs in Camp 53. In this way, the explanation work, which had been interrupted for eight days, was resumed on the 16th. However, our plan to explain to 500 people a day still could not be completed due to continued interference and obstruction by U.S. agents, and the continued opposition of U.S. agents to isolating the unexplained POWs forced the explanation work to be interrupted again after only one day of resumption. From this it can be seen that despite our repeated efforts to explain, if the control of the U.S. agents in the custodial camps is not broken, the explanation work will not be truly possible.

In order to ensure that the "Terms of Reference" and "Working Rules" are effectively observed, our side has repeatedly made suggestions to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, advocating that special agents who control and threaten POWs with violence in the POW camps must be eliminated. However, the Swiss and Swedish representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have repeatedly obstructed this, and the Indian representative, as chairman, also lacks decisiveness and cannot resolutely implement the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," resulting in the suspension of the explanation work. The Indian troops intercepted the secret directive of the special agents on the 8th, but did not announce it until the 23rd, and did not hand it over to our side until the 25th. This is obviously not right. Even in the period from the 8th to the 25th, our side made great efforts to enable the explanation work to be restored once again on the 16th. However, it is clear that relying solely on our efforts cannot prevent the explanation work from being sabotaged. If the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had immediately announced this secret directive after intercepting it and taken effective measures to sanction the special agents, it would certainly have been beneficial to the restoration of the explanation work. But the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did not think of this. As a result, during these 18 days, due to the sabotage of the U.S. agents, not only was the explanation work unable to proceed, but the Indian Custodial Forces also encountered greater difficulties in the management of the camps. For example, in the investigation of the murder of POW Zhang Liutai in the U.S. "hospital" in Tongchang-ri, the representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces were met with armed resistance from the special agents, and were unable to approach Camp 44 where the murder occurred, and were unable to perform the most basic duties of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The inconclusive investigation of the Zhang Liutai murder incident also proves that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission does not exercise its power to sanction those special agents who use force, it can only encourage those special agents to further and thoroughly undermine the "Terms of Reference" and the explanation work.

Now, the secret orders conveyed by the special agent Park Dong-hyuk from Syngman Rhee, Won Yong-duk, and Wang Dong-yuan have further proved that if the special agent control in the POW camps is not broken, and if the U.S., Rhee, and Chiang agents are not eliminated, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian troops cannot guarantee the conduct of any explanation work. Therefore, we firmly advocate that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces must exercise their legitimate powers and take decisive and resolute steps to first arrest the U.S., Rhee, and Chiang special agent leaders and murderers in the POW camps, such as Han Yin-song, Chi Ji-cheol, Han Bing-tae, Wang Shun-qing, Zhang Zun-xian, Wen Zhong-hao, "Teacher Ma," Ge Yun-fei, Cai Pei-pei, Deng Hong-xun, Kim Seong-rok, Shin Chang-ho, Lee Il-soo, and Kang Geun-ok, and severely punish them according to law; and thoroughly eliminate all special agents mixed into the POW camps. If this is not done, the explanation work will never be possible, and the "Terms of Reference" will be completely destroyed.

### 美方特务如不彻底清除  解释工作必将无法进行

    美方特务如不彻底清除  解释工作必将无法进行
    中立国遣返委员会十一月二十三日公布了印度看管部队于十一月八日截获的美李蒋方面特务朴东赫转达李承晚、元容德和王东原给东场里战俘营特务的秘密指令。在过去两个月中，印度看管部队曾截获许多与此同类的特务秘密信件，现在据已公布的这一指令就已经充分地暴露了美方特务控制战俘营的全部罪恶计谋。
    这封秘密指令所暴露的事实证明，东场里战俘营的特务组织是在美军对东场里战俘营的整个部署之下，受李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的直接指挥的。美李蒋方面直接指使大批李蒋特务控制着整个东场里战俘营，而以美方第六十四野战“医院”为特务活动的总联络站。这一批美李蒋方面的特务经常往来于战俘营与汉城之间，接受汉城和台北的指令，在东场里战俘营内疯狂进行破坏活动。它们残酷地杀害要求遣返的战俘，破坏解释工作，以图达到美方强迫扣留战俘的目的。美方的宣传机器一再宣传美国对战俘的“心理战”的胜利，并不断诬蔑朝中方面拖延解释工作，企图借此来掩盖美方的破坏活动。但是，现在印度看管部队所截获的美李蒋方面的这个秘密指令，不但使美方对于它的特务罪行再也无法抵赖，而且使美方对于朝中方面的一切造谣诬蔑彻底破产了。
    我方早已多次指出，在中立国看管营场中控制战俘的特务组织，是美方长期以来处心积虑地建立起来的，是从巨济岛等地美方战俘营原封不动地搬到中立区营场来的。在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以前，美方为继续保存这些特务组织，曾经作了极周密的布置。印度看管部队接管以后，这些特务组织便继续对战俘施行极为严密的恐怖统治，并按照美李蒋方面的计划积极策划破坏解释工作。当时我方曾向中立国遣返委员会提出清除特务、打乱战俘营原来编制的主张，但由于美方的阻挠而未能实现。解释工作开始后，这些特务组织更向中立国遣返委员会提出了许多无理要求，并以特务头子冒充所谓“战俘代表”横行无忌，时时刻刻威胁战俘，不让战俘听取解释，并对要求遣返的战俘不断地加以虐杀。所有这一切，不仅给中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队工作上造成极大的困难，并且迫使解释工作五次中断，至今仍无法恢复进行。
  解释工作开始四十四天以来，朝中方面为完成
   “职权范围”所规定的解释工作，曾不断地作了重大努力，但每次解释工作恢复后，就立即又被美方指使的特务所破坏。即以十一月这一个月来说，由于我方的努力使解释工作在十一月三日恢复后，美方指挥的特务又采取了新的破坏策略，致朝中方面只在四日对第二十八号营场的部分战俘进行了解释，五日这个营场的特务就控制未听解释的战俘不许出营。我方为照顾印度看管部队识别这些没有听解释的战俘的困难，便改向第二十二号营场进行解释，但由于这个营场的蒋匪特务采取了和二十八号营场同样的手段，并不许任何战俘离开营场，致使解释工作自六日起又被迫中断。为了照顾印度看管部队的困难，为了使解释工作迅速恢复，我方又作了新的努力，改向第五十三号营场战俘进行解释，这样，中断了八天的解释工作才于十六日又行恢复。但是，我方一天解释五百人的计划，由于继续遭到美方特务的干扰和阻挠，仍然不能完成，而美方特务继续反对隔离未经解释的战俘，就使解释工作刚恢复一天又被迫中断。由此可见，尽管我方对解释工作作了一再的努力，如果存在于看管营场的美方特务控制不被打破，解释工作是无论如何不可能真正进行的。
    为了保障“职权范围”及“工作细则”得到切实遵守，我方一再向中立国遣返委员会提出建议，主张必须清除战俘营场以暴力控制和威胁着战俘的特务。可是中立国遣返委员会的瑞士、瑞典代表却一再加以阻挠，而作为主席的印度代表也缺乏果断，不能坚决执行“职权范围”的规定，以致解释工作陷停顿状态。印度部队八日截获特务秘密指令，到二十三日才予公布，到二十五日才交给我方。这显然是不应该的。即以自八日到二十五日的这段时间来说，我方还作了重大的努力，使解释工作在十六日又曾一度恢复。但是，仅靠我方的努力显然不能使解释工作不受破坏。如果中立国遣返委员会在截获这个秘密指令后，立即将其公布，并采取有效措施来制裁特务，这样，对于解释工作的恢复当然是会有好处的。但中立国遣返委员会却计不出此。结果，在这十八天的时间内，由于美方特务的捣乱，不仅解释工作没有能够进行，就是印度看管部队对于营场的管理方面，也遭遇到更大的困难。譬如对东场里美国“医院”中战俘张六泰被谋杀案的调查工作，中立国遣返委员会代表和印度看管部队竟遭到了特务的武力抵制，根本不能接近发生谋杀案的第四十四号营场，根本不能执行中立国遣返委员会最起码的职责。张六泰被杀害事件的无结果的调查，同样证明如果中立国遣返委员会不行使其权力来制裁那些使用武力的特务分子，就只能鼓励那些特务进一步彻底地破坏“职权范围”和解释工作。
    现在，特务朴东赫转达的李承晚、元容德和王东原的秘密命令已经进一步地证明了战俘营中的特务控制如不打破，美李蒋方面特务如果不被清除，中立国遣返委员会和印度部队就不可能保证任何解释工作的进行。因此，我们坚决主张中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队必须行使他们的合法权力，采取果断坚决的步骤，把战俘营场里的美李蒋方面特务头子、杀人犯如韩银松、池基哲、韩秉泰、王顺清、张遵贤、文重浩、“马老师”、葛云飞、蔡培培、邓鸿勋、金成禄、申昌浩、李一守、姜根玉等首先逮捕起来，依法严厉惩办；并彻底清除一切混入战俘营场的特务。如果不是这样，解释工作必将永远无法进行，“职权范围”必将破坏无遗。
