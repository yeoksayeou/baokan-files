The Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and the Tianjin Railway Line Special Procuratorate were officially established on October 16th. These are the first railway line special court and railway line special procuratorate established in the country.

According to the resolution of the Second National Judicial Conference on gradually establishing special courts in a planned and focused manner, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court, with the assistance of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission working group and the Tianjin Railway Administration, began preparations for the establishment of a railway line special court in July. The Tianjin Municipal People's Court and the Tianjin Railway Administration selected a group of cadres with higher professional skills and specialized knowledge to form a temporary trial team. On the one hand, they investigated various cases that had occurred in the Tianjin Railway Administration over the years and in previous movements, and on the other hand, they accepted cases. The team successively accepted a total of twenty-four cases involving counter-revolution, theft, corruption, and traffic accidents, and gained preliminary experience in judicial work along the railway line. With the approval of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, the Tianjin Railway Line Special Court was officially established on October 16th, and the Tianjin Railway Line Special Procuratorate was also established at the same time; and a founding meeting was held in the Tianjin Railway Workers' Cultural Palace that afternoon.

At the founding meeting, Chen Fu, President of the Tianjin Municipal People's Court, delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Wan Xiaotang, Director of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government. He pointed out that the establishment of the Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and the Tianjin Railway Line Special Procuratorate marks a new direction for the work of the People's Court and the Procuratorate during the period of national economic construction. The tasks of the Railway Special Court and the Procuratorate are: to prosecute and adjudicate counter-revolutionary sabotage cases, corruption and theft cases, and accidents of responsibility that have caused significant losses to production or state property or jeopardized the safety of employees due to passive work, negligence of duty, and dereliction of duty related to railway transportation. He said: In the past, we have punished some counter-revolutionary saboteurs. In the future, in addition to continuing to heighten our vigilance and severely suppress counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, we must also pay close attention to and investigate corruption, theft, and major accidents of responsibility. Finally, Director Wan Xiaotang encouraged all staff to unite, help each other learn, and work hard.

Sun Xiang, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Railway Administration, also spoke at the meeting. She pointed out that the vast majority of employees in the bureau have actively engaged in the production increase and economy practice movement and have achieved great results. However, there are still shortcomings in our railway transportation work. After listing some counter-revolutionary sabotage, corruption, theft, and major accidents of responsibility, Sun Xiang said: The establishment of the Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and the Tianjin Railway Line Special Procuratorate provides a more powerful guarantee for the completion and over-completion of the production increase and economy practice plan. She called on the representatives attending the meeting to publicize this to all railway employees so that they can have a correct understanding of the Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and the Tianjin Railway Line Special Procuratorate, and vigorously support and cooperate with the work of the court and the procuratorate. Wang Huaian, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government, spoke on behalf of the Ministry of Justice at the meeting. He encouraged the staff of the court and the procuratorate to work hard and create experience. Finally, the representatives of all the staff of the court and the procuratorate expressed to the meeting that they must do a good job, better exert the role of the people's judicial organs, and serve to ensure the smooth progress of the people's railway construction cause.

    天津铁路沿线专门法院和检察署成立
    天津铁路沿线专门法院和天津铁路沿线专门检察署于十月十六日正式成立。这是全国最先成立的铁路沿线专门法院和铁路沿线专门检察署。
    根据第二届全国司法会议关于有计划有重点地逐步建立专门法庭的决议，天津市人民法院在中央政法委员会工作组和天津铁路管理局协助下，于七月间开始进行建立铁路沿线专门法院的筹备工作。天津市人民法院和天津铁路管理局抽调了一批业务水平较高、有专门知识的干部组成临时审判组，一面调查天津铁路管理局历年来以及历次运动中所发生的各种案件，一面即受理案件。该组先后受理了反革命、盗窃、贪污、行车事故等共二十四个案件，取得了在铁路沿线进行司法工作的初步经验。经天津市人民政府批准后，于十月十六日正式成立天津铁路沿线专门法院，天津铁路沿线专门检察署也同时成立；并于当日下午在天津铁路工人文化宫举行了成立大会。
    成立大会上，天津市人民法院院长陈阜致词后，由天津市人民政府政治法律委员会主任万晓塘讲话。他指出：天津铁路沿线专门法院和天津铁路沿线专门检察署的成立，标志着人民法院工作和检察工作在国家经济建设时期的新方向。铁路专门法院和检察署的任务是：检察和审判与铁路运输有关的反革命破坏案件，贪污和盗窃案件，以及因消极怠工、玩忽职守致使生产或国家财产蒙受重大损失或职工安全受到危害的责任事故。他说：过去我们曾惩办了一些反革命破坏分子，今后我们除了应该继续提高警惕，严厉镇压反革命破坏活动以外，对贪污盗窃分子和重大的责任事故，也必须严格地注意和查究。最后，万晓塘主任勉励全体工作人员团结一致，互助学习，努力作好工作。
    天津铁路管理局副局长孙湘也在会上发言。她指出：目前全局绝大部分员工都已经积极地投入增产节约竞赛运动，并取得了很大成绩。但是，在我们的铁路运输工作中，还存在着缺点。孙湘在列举了一些反革命破坏、贪污、盗窃和重大责任事故之后说：成立了天津铁路沿线专门法院和天津铁路沿线专门检察署，对增产节约计划的完成和超额完成就有了更有力的保障。她号召该局到会的代表向全体铁路员工进行宣传，使员工们都能对天津铁路沿线专门法院和天津铁路沿线专门检察署有正确的认识，并大力支持和配合该院、署的工作。中央人民政府司法部办公厅主任王怀安代表司法部在会上讲话。他勉励该院、署工作人员努力工作，创造经验。最后，该院、署全体工作人员代表向大会表示一定要做好工作，更好地发挥人民司法机关的作用，为保障人民铁路建设事业的顺利进行而服务。
