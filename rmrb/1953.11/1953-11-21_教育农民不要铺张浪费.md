    Educate Peasants Not to Be Extravagant and Wasteful
    A letter from Shen Fuhua and Cao Renjie of the Dafeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: In Yanti Township, Baiju District, Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province, there are 930 households. This year, the early autumn crops have generally yielded a bumper harvest, and the late autumn crops are also good. As a result, cadres and the masses have generally developed a sense of complacency and optimism, thinking that it doesn't matter to spend more money when there is a bumper harvest. In addition, the township leadership has not carried out publicity and education on increasing production and practicing economy, and opposing extravagance and waste in a timely manner, resulting in serious waste. It is understood that from the summer harvest to the present, in addition to extravagance and waste in celebrations such as birthdays and weddings, the waste in superstition has reached 21.04 million yuan. According to statistics, this amount could buy 30,000 catties of corn, which could feed more than 50 people for a year at 1.5 catties per person per day. This is truly an alarming figure, but it has not attracted the attention of local cadres and the masses, and wasteful phenomena such as extravagance and superstition continue to occur.
    After learning about this situation, the Baiju District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that if it was not corrected in time, it would have a great impact on the production and life of the people in the township this winter and next spring. Therefore, it immediately sent people to the township to assist the Party branch in convening Party and Youth League branch meetings, village meetings, etc. Through the method of detailed accounting, publicity and education were carried out to oppose extravagance and waste, and in conjunction with the state's call for increasing production and practicing economy, mobilization was carried out. As a result, the masses' awareness was raised. For example, Shan Fuqing, the deputy village chief of Tuanjie Village, originally planned to spend 400,000 yuan to celebrate his son's first birthday, but has now decided to make a peck of wheat flour for his family to eat at home; Hu Shaolou of Xinlong Village originally wanted to hold a "Flame Mouth" ceremony for his deceased uncle to "save his soul," but has now decided not to do it and use the money for production. Chen Changhong of the village said, "The government is so good now, planning for us everywhere. In the past, who would care about these things? Increasing production and practicing economy is a good thing, and we should respond." Now many households are formulating plans to increase production and practice economy, guaranteeing to increase grain production, reduce grain loss, and sell the surplus grain to the state. The money wasted on superstition will be saved and invested in reproduction to strive for a bumper harvest next year and support national industrial construction.
      Editor's note: To change the masses' extravagant and wasteful habits, the key lies in the timely publicity and education of the masses and cadres by the local district and township leading cadres. As long as our district and township cadres care about the lives of the masses with a positive attitude and explain the advantages and disadvantages to the masses by using detailed accounting methods, then the phenomenon of extravagance and waste can be reduced. Yang Longsheng of Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, wrote a letter reflecting a similar case of the Baiju District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party caring about the lives of the masses: Song Chengding, a farmer in Guanshan Township, District 3 of the county, died of illness in September this year. His family prepared to invite Taoist priests to chant scriptures, slaughter pigs, and buy wine to entertain guests. Later, the township government and the masses used the method of detailed accounting and combined it with the education of increasing production and practicing economy to persuade his family to change their plan, so that his family voluntarily accepted everyone's opinions, saving more than 80 pecks of rice, which could provide five people with 100 days of living. It can be seen that as long as we explain clearly to the masses and enable them to establish the concept of long-term increase in production and practicing economy, the peasants will change their extravagant and wasteful practices.
      In recent years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government in rural production work and the mobilization of the vast number of peasants' enthusiasm for production, all kinds of crops have achieved bumper harvests, and the living standards of peasants have generally risen. As a result, a sense of blind optimism has arisen among some peasants and cadres, thinking that it doesn't matter to spend more money after a bumper harvest; coupled with some long-standing bad habits and superstitious customs in rural areas, and the relevant leading departments of the government did not pay attention to publicity and education in advance, resulting in extravagance and waste, which deserves timely attention from all localities.

### 教育农民不要铺张浪费

专栏：读者来信摘要

    教育农民不要铺张浪费
    中共大丰县委会沈福华、曹人杰来信：江苏省大丰县白驹区沿堤乡，共有九百三十户，今年早秋作物普遍获得丰收，晚秋作物也不错，因此干部和群众普遍产生麻痹乐观情绪，认为丰收了多花些钱没什么了不起，加上乡的领导方面没有很好针对以上思想及时进行增产节约、反对铺张浪费的宣传教育，结果，发生了严重的浪费现象。据了解，由夏收后到目前止，全乡除贺寿、结婚等铺张浪费外，在迷信方面的浪费即达两千一百零四万元。据统计如果买玉米可以买三万斤，每人以一天吃一斤半计算，可以供五十多人吃一年。这真是一笔惊人的数字，但并没有引起当地干部和群众的注意，铺张迷信等浪费现象仍在继续发生。
    中共白驹区委了解这一情况后，认为若不及时纠正，对该乡人民群众今冬明春生产、生活大有影响，因此，立即派人到该乡协助党支部连续召开了党、团员支部大会、村民会等，通过算细账方法进行反对铺张浪费的宣传教育和结合国家增产节约的号召进行宣传动员，结果提高了群众认识，如团结村副村长单福庆最近准备用四十万元给儿子贺周岁，现已决定弄一斗小麦面家里人自己吃吃；新龙村胡绍楼本来要替已死的叔叔放“焰口”“超渡亡魂”，现已决定不办了，将这些钱用到生产上去。村里陈长宏说：“现在政府太好了，处处为我们打算，过去谁管咱这些事。增产节约是好事，我们应该响应。”现在好多户正订立增产节约计划，大家保证增产粮食，减少粮食损耗，把多余粮食卖给国家。把迷信浪费的钱节省下来投入再生产争取明年丰收，来支援国家工业建设。
      编者按：要改变群众的铺张浪费现象，关键在于当地区乡领导干部及时对群众及干部经常进行宣传教育。只要我们的区乡干部以积极的态度关心群众生活并用算细账的办法向群众讲明利害，那么，铺张浪费现象是可以减少的。江西省萍乡县杨隆生来信反映了一件类似中共白驹区委关心群众生活的事例：该县三区观山乡农民宋成丁在今年九月病故，其家属准备请道士念经，杀猪买酒请客，后由乡政府与群众用算细账的方法，并结合增产节约的教育劝他家属改变计划，使他家自愿地接受了大家的意见，省下了八十多斗稻谷，可以供五个人一百天的生活。可见只要我们向群众讲解清楚，使群众树立长期增产节约的观点，农民是会改变那些铺张浪费的作法的。
      几年来，由于党和政府对农村生产工作的正确领导及发动了广大农民的生产积极性，各种农作物都获得了丰收，农民生活普遍上升，因而在一部分农民和干部间产生了盲目乐观情绪，认为丰收后多花钱算不了什么；再加上农村有一些相沿已久的陋规和迷信习惯，而政府有关领导部门事前也不注意宣传教育，以致造成铺张浪费现象，值得各地及时注意。
