Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 29th: The Northeast Administrative Committee held its third enlarged committee meeting on the 21st. The meeting conveyed and discussed the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, and based on the spirit of the general line and general task, summarized the work of the past ten months and deployed future work. Attending the meeting were Vice Chairmen of the Administrative Committee Lin Feng, Gao Chongmin, Zhang Mingyuan, Wang Jinxiang, Gu Zhuoxin, and more than 60 people including members, and heads of committees, bureaus, departments, and banks. The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Gao Chongmin.

Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, conveyed in detail the general line, general task of the state during the transition period, and the basic tasks of the first five-year construction plan. Regarding the general line and general task, Lin Feng emphasized after conveying them: We must earnestly study the general line and vigorously publicize the general line, strictly follow the state's general line and general task to inspect and deploy various tasks, and prevent any tendency to deviate from the general line and general task.

Regarding the work of the past ten months, Lin Feng pointed out: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and under the glorious illumination of our country's general line, the people of Northeast China began the first year of the state's first five-year construction plan. Over the past ten months, we have achieved great success in all aspects of our work. In terms of industrial production, this year's production plan was formulated on an advanced basis. From January to October, the total output value of state-owned and local state-owned industries completed 102.6 percent of the plan for the same period, an increase of 28.7 percent over the same period last year. This year, most enterprises implemented planned management, improved the level of business management, product quality has been significantly improved, and the trial production of new products has also achieved great success. The labor productivity of state-owned industries has greatly improved compared with last year, and production costs have also been reduced compared with the plan. In terms of implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts and promoting advanced experience, this year the Northeast region has seen many technical innovators and advanced producers. In terms of basic construction, 77.3 percent of the plan for the same period has been completed from January to October. It is estimated that the annual plan can be basically completed by the end of the year. This year, basic construction has emphasized the establishment of a responsibility system and the implementation of the construction policy of "good, fast, economical, and safe" from the beginning. Therefore, this year's project progress is fast, the quality is good, the accidents are few, and the completion of the plan is better. Lin Feng also explained in detail the gains and achievements in trade cooperation, transportation, finance,政法, culture and education, and other aspects of work.

Regarding the key points of winter work, Lin Feng pointed out: The most central task at present is to continue to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, complete and overfulfill the state plan, and prepare for next year's industrial production and basic construction; in rural areas, we must do a good job in winter production, mutual aid and cooperation, and grain requisitioning and purchasing; we must earnestly study and vigorously publicize the state's general line during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first five-year construction plan. Regarding the issue of future industrial production, Lin Feng especially emphasized the need to comprehensively and systematically learn from the Soviet Union; strengthen the study and mastery of new technologies; continue to vigorously strengthen technical management and improve business management; continue to improve the utilization rate of existing equipment and strengthen political work. In terms of basic construction, units that have completed their tasks should pay close attention to finishing work; units that have not yet completed construction should strive to complete the plan and minimize cross-year projects; all units that are constructing in winter should check the various conditions for winter construction and pay close attention to project quality and safe operations.

Regarding rural work, Lin Feng pointed out: In the future, we should continue to strengthen the socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy. This winter, we must do a good job in sideline production and production self-rescue in disaster areas, and prepare favorable conditions for next year's production. Mutual aid and cooperation are the most important work for transforming the small-peasant economy. Those who already have the conditions to establish agricultural producers' cooperatives can establish them now; continue to deliberate on the establishment of new cooperatives through various winter tasks; on the existing basis, agricultural producers' cooperatives in the entire Northeast region should and can develop to more than double next year, but in the work, we should still adhere to the policy of active leadership and steady development. All localities should earnestly summarize the experience of mutual aid and cooperation, and seize the time to train the backbone of mutual aid groups and production cooperatives. County and district cadres must all study the experience and knowledge of mutual aid and cooperation well to improve their leadership ability. This is an important link in running mutual aid groups and agricultural producers' cooperatives well in the future.

Regarding the work of grain requisitioning and purchasing, Lin Feng said that these two things must be done well so that the state can have sufficient grain to ensure national construction. It is necessary to universally and deeply publicize the general line to the peasants, strengthen political work, and explain the consistency between national industrialization and the interests of the peasants.

Lin Feng pointed out: The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. Private industrialists and businessmen should strive to operate enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, conscientiously abide by government decrees, earnestly study the general line, and carry out their own transformation. Efforts should be made to complete the work of basic-level elections and county-level elections before the end of March next year. It is necessary to effectively run universities and specialized schools, secondary technical schools, and cultivate construction talents to meet the needs of national construction.

Finally, Lin Feng pointed out: The fundamental issue of our country's general line during the transition period is to gradually realize socialist industrialization in our country. The focus of the first five-year construction plan is in the Northeast, and a large part of the 141 large-scale enterprises that the Soviet Union is helping our country build are also in the Northeast. In order to better implement the national general line and fully realize the glorious tasks given to us by the state, this requires cadres at all levels to earnestly study and publicize the national general line and general task during the transition period, and to check and summarize the past work according to the general line and the basic tasks of the first five-year construction plan, and formulate the work plan for next year so that our country's socialist industrialization and the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce can be gradually and smoothly completed.

After Lin Feng's report, the meeting launched a lively discussion. Those who attended the meeting unanimously supported the state's general line and general task during the transition period and expressed their determination to resolutely implement it in their work departments and work positions. The meeting was finally summarized by Lin Feng. After repeatedly emphasizing the important significance of earnestly studying and publicizing the national general line during the transition period, he required governments and work departments at all levels to check and summarize this year's work in December according to the basic tasks of the general line during the transition period and the first five-year construction plan, and to put forward the main points of work for 1954 and the work plan for the first quarter.

    东北行政委员会举行扩大会议
    根据总路线布置今后工作
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】东北行政委员会于二十一日举行第三次委员扩大会议。会议传达与讨论了国家在过渡时期的总路线与总任务，并根据总路线、总任务的精神，总结了今年十个月的工作和布置了今后工作。出席这次会议的有行政委员会副主席林枫、高崇民、张明远、汪金祥、顾卓新等及各委员、各委、局、处、行的负责人共六十余人。会议由副主席高崇民主持。
    东北行政委员会副主席林枫在会上详细传达了国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务和第一个五年建设计划的基本任务，并报告了东北地区今年十个月的工作情况和今年冬季工作的要点。关于总路线总任务问题，林枫在传达后着重指出：我们必须认真地学习总路线和大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，严格地遵照国家总路线总任务来检查和布置各项工作，防止任何脱离总路线总任务的倾向。
    关于今年十个月的工作情况，林枫指出：东北人民在毛主席、中央人民政府的领导下，在我们国家总路线的光辉照耀下，开始了国家第一个五年建设计划的第一年，十个月来我们在各方面的工作都获得很大成就。在工业生产方面，今年的生产计划是在先进基础上制订的，一月至十月国营与地方国营工业总产值完成同期计划的百分之一百零二点六，比去年同期增长百分之二十八点七。今年多数企业贯彻了计划管理，提高了企业的经营管理水平，产品质量并有显著提高，新产品试制也获得很大成就，国营工业的劳动生产率比去年有很大提高，生产成本比计划亦有降低。在贯彻苏联专家建议、推广先进经验方面，今年东北地区出现了不少技术革新者和先进生产者。在基本建设方面，一至十月份已完成同期计划的百分之七十七点三，估计到年底可以基本上完成年度计划。今年基本建设由于一开始就强调了建立责任制，贯彻“好、快、省、安全”的施工方针，因此，今年工程进度快，质量好，事故少，完成计划较好。在农业生产方面，贯彻了中央“农业生产为农村压倒一切的中心任务”的指示，各级领导干部与全体农民进行了紧张的工作。互助合作有了进一步发展和提高，积极而稳步地进行了技术改革。今年农业生产虽然遭受了各种自然灾害，但绝大部分地区获得丰收，粮食产量仍然比一九五一年为高。关于贸易合作、交通运输、财政金融、政法、文教等各方面工作的收获和成绩，林枫也详细作了说明。
    关于冬季工作的要点，林枫指出：当前最中心的任务是继续开展增产节约运动，完成和超额完成国家计划，做好明年工业生产与基本建设的准备工作；农村要作好冬季生产、互助合作和征粮购粮工作；必须认真学习和大张旗鼓地宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年建设计划的基本任务。关于今后工业生产问题，林枫特别强调指出要全面和系统地学习苏联；加强学习和掌握新的技术；继续大力加强技术管理，改进经营管理工作；继续提高现有设备的运用率和加强政治工作。在基本建设方面，已完成任务的单位要十分注意作好收尾工作；尚未完工的单位，要力争完成计划，尽量减少跨年度工程；凡在冬季施工的单位，要检查冬季施工的各种条件，严密注意工程质量和安全作业。
    关于农村工作，林枫指出：今后应继续加强对小农经济进行社会主义的改造。今冬在农村要做好副业生产与灾区的生产自救，并为明年生产准备好有利条件。互助合作是改造小农经济的最重要的工作，现在已经具备建立农业生产合作社条件的，即可建立起来；经过冬季各种工作，继续酝酿建立新社；东北全区农业生产合作社在现有基础上明年应该也可能发展到一倍以上，但在工作中仍应坚持积极领导，稳步发展的方针。各地应切实总结互助合作的经验，抓紧时间训练互助组与生产合作社的骨干。县、区干部都要很好地学习互助合作的经验和知识，提高他们的领导能力，这是今后办好互助组和农业生产合作社的重要一环。
    关于征粮购粮工作，林枫说，这两件事必须做好，使国家掌握足够的粮食，以保证国家建设。要普遍深入地向农民宣传总路线，加强政治工作，说明国家工业化与农民利益的一致性。
    林枫指出：要有计划、有步骤地进行对私营工商业的社会主义改造。私营工商业家要努力经营有利于国计民生的企业，切实遵守政府法令，认真学习总路线，进行对自己的改造。普选工作争取在明年三月底以前，将基层选举、县级选举工作做完。要切实办好大学和专科学校，中等技术学校，培养建设人才，以适应国家建设的需要。
    最后，林枫指出：我们国家在过渡时期总路线的根本问题是使我们国家逐步实现社会主义工业化。第一个五年建设计划的重点是在东北，苏联帮助我国建设的一百四十一项规模巨大的企业很大部分也在东北。为了更好地贯彻国家总路线，完满地实现国家所给予我们的光荣任务，这就要求各级干部必须认真学习和宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务，并根据总路线和第一个五年建设计划的基本任务检查和总结过去的工作，定出明年的工作计划，使我们国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业以及对资本主义工商业的改造工作逐步地顺利地完成。
    林枫报告后，会议展开热烈讨论。到会的人一致拥护国家在过渡时期的总路线与总任务，并表示要在自己的工作部门和自己的工作岗位上坚决贯彻执行。会议最后由林枫作总结。他反复强调认真学习和宣传国家在过渡时期总路线的重要意义以后，要求各级政府与各个工作部门，应在十二月份内根据过渡时期总路线与第一个五年建设计划的基本任务，将今年的工作加以检查和总结，提出一九五四年的工作要点和第一季度的工作计划。
