The Longxi County People's Government Grain Bureau in Fujian Province and the Dazhong Oil Mill North Factory in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, have successively succeeded in extracting oil from rice bran. Recently, the China National Oils and Fats Corporation studied the production and efficacy of rice bran oil and decided to promote the method of extracting oil from rice bran in an all-round way.

In late May of this year, employees of the Longxi County People's Government Grain Bureau began to try to extract oil from rice bran. The method was to first steam the rice bran in a steaming basket for eight to ten minutes, and then put it on an ordinary oil press for extraction. Every 100 jin of rice bran can extract 7.3 to 8.12 jin of bran oil, and every 100 jin of glutinous rice bran can yield about 9.3 jin of oil. Later, workers in the oil production workshop of the Dazhong Oil Mill North Factory in Xinghua County also tried to extract oil from rice bran, and the oil yield increased compared with the trial extraction by the employees of the Longxi County Grain Bureau, with each 100 jin of rice bran yielding 13 jin of oil.

According to the China National Oils and Fats Corporation, rice bran oil belongs to semi-drying oil in oil chemistry, contains rich vitamin B, can be used for edible purposes, and can also be used as an industrial oiling raw material. The Tianjin branch of the China National Oils and Fats Corporation has tested rice bran oil and rice bran cake produced after oil extraction and determined that rice bran oil is edible, and rice bran cake still contains 12% oil, which can be used as feed and fertilizer.

The output of rice bran, the raw material for extracting rice bran oil in our country, is very large. According to the Processing Bureau of the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government, in 1952, the country had more than 680,000 tons of rice bran. In the past, rice-producing areas did not pay much attention to rice bran. Except for some areas that used it as fertilizer, or used it to feed pigs and ducks when feed was scarce in spring and winter, most rice bran was treated as waste. Now, the method of extracting rice bran oil successfully tested by the Longxi County Grain Bureau is very simple. Ordinary oil extraction tools such as iron hammers and wooden presses can be used for extraction. If the national rice bran is fully utilized, it can not only increase the supply of edible oil, but also use waste to create new wealth for the country.

Based on the above situation, the China National Oils and Fats Corporation is preparing to comprehensively extract rice bran oil through the food departments and light industry departments.

### 中国油脂公司  推广用稻米糠榨油

　　中国油脂公司
    推广用稻米糠榨油
    福建省龙溪县人民政府粮食局和江苏省兴化县大众油米北厂先后试用稻米糠榨油成功，最近中国油脂公司对米糠油的生产情况、效能等作了研究，决定将用稻米糠榨油的办法作全面推广。
    今年五月下旬，龙溪县人民政府粮食局职工开始试用米糠榨油，办法是先把米糠放在蒸龙里蒸八分钟到十分钟，然后放在普通榨油机上榨制。每一百斤米糠可以榨出糠油七斤三两到八斤十二两，每一百斤糯米糠可出油九斤三两左右。后来，兴化县大众油米北厂制油间工人也试用米糠榨油，出油量较龙溪县粮食局职工试榨时有所增加，每一百斤米糠可出油十三斤。
    据中国油脂公司研究，米糠油在油脂化学中属半干性油品，含有丰富的维他命乙，可供食用，并可作为工业上的油润原料。中国油脂公司天津市公司对米糠油及榨油后所产米糠饼作过化验，断定米糠油可以食用，米糠饼仍含有百分之十二的油量，可作饲料及肥料。
    我国榨制米糠油的原料——稻米糠的产量很大，据中央人民政府粮食部加工局计算，一九五二年全国约有稻米糠六十八万余吨。过去各产稻区对米糠很不重视，除部分地区用作肥料，或在春季、冬季饲料缺乏时用来饲喂猪鸭外，多将米糠当作废物处理。现在龙溪县粮食局等试验成功的榨制米糠油的办法很简单，普通铁锤木榨等一般榨油工具即可用来榨制。如将全国稻米糠充分利用起来，既可增加食油供应数量，又可利用废物为国家创造新的财富。
    中国油脂公司根据以上情况，正准备通过粮食部门和轻工业部门全面榨制米糠油。
