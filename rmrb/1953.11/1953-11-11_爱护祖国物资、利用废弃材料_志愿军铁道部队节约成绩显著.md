    Cherishing National Resources, Utilizing Waste Materials
    Volunteer Army Railway Corps Achieves Remarkable Results in Economy
   [Report from this newspaper] Since going abroad three years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps has not only achieved victory in the struggle against the enemy on the Korean railway transportation front, protecting the unimpeded flow of the transportation line, but also made significant achievements in saving national financial resources.
    For the past three years, in order to save the motherland's material wealth and overcome the difficulties of insufficient material supply brought about by the enemy's severe bombing, the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps have put forward slogans such as "Save materials, cherish materials," "Obtain materials locally, collect waste materials," and "Never leave the site empty-handed." In the intervals of intense battle and rush repairs, they launched a campaign to collect waste materials and make their own tools and parts, accumulating and creating a large amount of wealth for the motherland. From the first day of entering Korea until the end of June this year, according to rough statistics, all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps collected, salvaged, and self-made materials and tools worth a total of 265.6 billion yuan, which could buy 177 fighter planes. In the steel rail category alone, 34,234 rails were collected and sorted, which could lay 161 kilometers of railway; 248 holes of various steel beams were collected and salvaged, which could erect a large iron bridge 2,809 meters long. If these materials were transported by train, they could fill 6,780 train cars, stretching 75 kilometers.
    In the movement to collect and self-make materials, the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and gave full play to their unlimited intelligence, producing a large number of advanced units and model figures who created wealth for the motherland. The heroic company – Yang Lian Di Company saved materials worth a total of two fighter planes in three years. The Ninth Company of a certain unit, which won a collective second-class merit, collected 20,000 pieces of waste material worth more than 500 million yuan during the 76 days and nights of fighting against the enemy's "key bombing" of the Bailingchuan Bridge. At the beginning of their entry into Korea, the communications company of a certain unit relied entirely on collecting materials abandoned by the enemy to rush repair telecommunications lines. Among them, more than 30,000 meters of leather wire alone were collected, worth more than 200 million yuan. In the two months of fighting against the "strangulation warfare" in the throat area, the enemy destroyed 2,000 steel rails, but the soldiers collected and sorted out 2,071 rails. The detachment launched a "stone movement" and collected more than 1,000 cubic meters of stone in one month. Special-class hero Guo Jinsheng, in order to remove obstacles for rush repairs and solve the difficulty of insufficient explosives for mining stone, risked his life to remove 659 time bombs and cluster bombs one after another, taking out explosives worth 165 million yuan. First-class hero Ren Yuntian collected 3,500 kilograms of materials by himself and made 593 tools. Li Wanhua, the commander of a certain detachment who won the second-class merit, proposed the method of repairing large rails to transport stones, transporting more than 14,000 cubic meters of stones in total, saving 28,000 man-days. Under his leadership, a certain detachment collected damaged steel rails, fishplates, screws, and other materials that were repaired and reused, which were worth more than 11.03 billion yuan.
    After the armistice, the railway troops immediately participated in the restoration and construction project of the Korean railway. All commanders and fighters responded to the Volunteer Army Party Committee's instructions on economy, taking "saving every nail and piece of wood of the motherland" and "cherishing all material wealth of the motherland" as practical actions to support the motherland's economic construction. In the project, based on the existing material resources, they achieved "tailor-made," "supply locally," and "make the best use of everything," accurately calculated and rationally used every tiny piece of material to accumulate wealth for the motherland. In the past few months, the movement to collect and self-make materials and tools has continued to flourish. Yang Lian Di Company alone collected and modified more than 5,000 pieces of materials such as steel rails, palladium saws, square-headed needles, and fishplates in October alone, worth more than 167.27 million yuan. The third squad of the first company of a certain unit built a small blacksmith's furnace in ten days, using sack and straw bags to fan the wind instead of bellows, and put a flat car tile on the sleeper as an anvil for iron. Hu Chaoyin and other three soldiers relied on it to modify and repair more than 7,500 pieces of equipment in two months, worth more than 27 million yuan. In the reconstruction project of a certain large bridge, it was originally planned to use 28,000 sacks to build cofferdams on the foundation. In order to save sacks, the soldiers scooped water out of the foundation with basins in order to build fewer cofferdams. When the engineering and technical cadres saw this creation of the soldiers, they went into the water to re-measure the degree of damage to the foundation. Therefore, they changed the original plan and used a water pump to pump out the water, and only needed to surround a circle of cofferdams. In this way, 25,300 sacks were saved, worth more than 1.265 billion yuan. In order to solve the urgent need for steel beams, the soldiers of a certain unit implemented the method of renovating waste products, and successively spliced and riveted 24 holes of various types of steel beams. Among them, 6 holes of plate beams alone were worth more than 612.8 million yuan, which not only timely supplied the needs of the project, but also saved a large amount of wealth for the motherland.
    Now, all the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps are continuing to carry out the economy movement with a high degree of patriotism, saving and creating wealth for the motherland.

    爱护祖国物资、利用废弃材料
    志愿军铁道部队节约成绩显著
   【本报讯】中国人民志愿军铁道部队出国三年以来，不仅在朝鲜铁道运输战线上取得了对敌斗争的胜利，保卫了运输线的畅通无阻，而且在节省国家资财方面做出了显著成绩。
    志愿军铁道部队指战员们，三年来为了节省祖国的物资财富，和克服敌人严重轰炸下带来的材料供应不足的困难，纷纷提出“节省材料、爱护材料”，“就地取材，搜集废料”，“空手不下现场”等口号，在紧张战斗抢修的间隙里，开展搜集废料弃材自造工具零件的运动，为祖国积蓄和创造了大量的财富。自入朝第一天起，到今年六月底止，据概略的统计，志愿军铁道部队全体指战员共搜集、打捞和自制材料工具，价值达二千六百五十六亿元，能购买一百七十七架战斗机。只钢轨一项，就搜集和整理了三万四千二百三十四根，可铺设一百六十一公里长的铁路；搜集和打捞各种钢梁二百四十八孔，可架设一座二千八百零九公尺长的大铁桥。这些材料如用火车装运，可装六千七百八十个车皮，排列七十五公里之远。
    在搜集、自制材料运动中，志愿军铁道部队指战员们表现了高度的爱国主义精神，发挥了无限的聪明智慧，涌现出大批为祖国创造财富的先进单位和模范人物。英雄连队——杨连第连三年来节约物资的总值可买两架战斗机。荣立集体二等功的某部九连，在百岭川桥反敌机“重点轰炸”的七十六昼夜奋战中，搜集废材达两万件，价值五亿余元。某部通讯连入朝初期全部依靠搜集敌人遗弃的材料抢修电讯线路，其中仅皮线一项就搜集了三万多公尺，价值两亿余元。某支队在咽喉地带反“绞杀战”的两个月中，敌人炸毁钢轨二千根，战士们却搜集、整理了二千零七十一根。该支队开展“一块石头运动”，在一个月内就搜集了一千多立方石头。特等功臣郭金升，为排除抢修障碍和解决开采山石炸药不足的困难，冒着生命危险先后卸除了六百五十九枚定时弹和子母弹，取出价值一亿六千五百万元的炸药。一等功臣任运田，一个人搜集了三千五百公斤的材料，制成工具五百九十三件。荣立二等功的某支队长李万华，提出修大轨道运石头的办法，共运石头一万四千多立方，节省人工两万八千个。在他领导下的某支队，搜集被炸坏的钢轨、鱼尾钣、螺丝等经过修理重新使用的材料，就值一百一十亿三千余万元。
    停战以后，铁道部队立即参加朝鲜铁路的恢复修建工程。全体指战员纷纷响应志愿军党委的节约指示，以“节省祖国的一钉一木”、“爱护祖国一切物资财富”，作为支援祖国经济建设的实际行动。并在工程中根据现有物力做到“量体裁衣”，“就地取给”，“物尽其用”，确切地精打细算，合理地使用每一件微小的材料，为祖国积蓄财富。几个月来，搜集、自制料具的运动继续蓬勃地进行着。杨连第连仅在十月份一个月内，就搜集与改制钢轨、钯锯子、方头针、鱼尾钣等材料五千余件，价值一亿六千七百二十余万元。某部一连三班，十天内建立起一座小铁匠炉，用麻袋和草袋煽风代替风箱，弄一个平车瓦接在枕木上当打铁的砧子。胡朝银等三个战士依靠它，在两个月内改制和修理器材七千五百多件，价值两千七百多万元。某大桥恢复修建工程中，原计划用两万八千个麻袋在基础上搭围堰。为了节省麻袋，战士们在基础里用水盆往外淘水，以便少搭围堰。工程技术干部见到战士们这个创造，下水重新测量了基础破坏的程度，于是改变了原来的计划，用抽水机将水抽出，只围一圈围堰就可以了。这样，便节省了二万五千三百个麻袋，价值十二亿六千五百万元之多。某部战士为解决钢梁急需，实行废物翻新办法，先后拚铆了各种类型的钢梁二十四孔，其中仅六孔钣梁即值六亿一千二百多万元，既及时供应了工程上的需要，又为祖国节约了大笔财富。
    现在，志愿军铁道部队的全体指战员们，正以高度爱国主义精神继续开展节约运动，为祖国节省和创造财富。
