　　The Wuhan Municipal Cultural Relics Management Committee has collected a large number of cultural relics over the past year, including jade, bronzes, and pottery from the Shang and Zhou dynasties onwards. Some are valuable historical and artistic items, such as a bronze *lu* (vessel for holding wine) from the Shang Dynasty, a bronze sword from the Zhou Dynasty, bronze mirrors from the Han and Tang Dynasties, famous Longquan kiln porcelain from the Song and Ming Dynasties, and bronze cups that are yet to be identified. Among these cultural relics are also over 44,000 volumes of Song and Ming Dynasty versions and handwritten rare books, as well as Qing Dynasty engraved books, and a large number of celebrity calligraphy, paintings, and carvings. In addition, twenty-five ancient tombs from the Six Dynasties, Tang, and Song Dynasties have been successively discovered at basic construction sites in the Donghu District, Nanhu District, and the suburbs of Hanyang, and more than 300 burial objects such as pottery bowls, plates, carts, and horses, carved with beautiful patterns, and many tomb bricks carved with human figures, lotus flowers, and exquisite patterns were unearthed. In these tombs, some pottery figurines with monkey-headed human bodies and pig-headed human bodies, as well as two glazed pottery figurines with a height of 64 cm dressed as warriors, were also excavated. Many of these cultural relics were donated or transferred by private individuals and various organizations. Most of the ancient tombs were discovered by workers at basic construction sites during their work. After discovering the ancient tombs, they took care not to damage the tombs, proactively contacted the Cultural Relics Management Committee, and helped with the excavation. Farmers in the suburbs of the city also handed over many ancient objects they had previously unearthed to the Cultural Relics Management Committee.

　　武汉市文物管理委员会收集大批古代文物
    武汉市文物管理委员会一年来收集了大批文物，其中包括商、周以来历代的玉器、铜器和陶器等。有些是很有价值的历史艺术品，像商朝时候盛酒用的铜卤，周朝的铜剑，汉朝和唐朝的铜镜，宋、明两朝有名的龙泉窑瓷器以及尚待考证的青铜杯等。在这些文物中还有宋、明二朝的版本和手抄珍本书籍以及清朝刻本书籍共四万四千多册，并有大批各种名人字、画及雕刻品。此外，武昌东湖区、南湖区及汉阳城郊等地，在基本建设工地还先后发现了六朝以及唐、宋时代的古墓二十五座，挖掘出陶制的、雕着美观的花纹的碗、盘、车、马等伴葬的明器三百多件和许多雕有人像、莲花和精致图案的墓砖。在这些墓里，还掘出了一些猴头人身及猪头人身的陶俑和两具武士装束的高六十四公分的釉陶俑。这些文物中，有不少是由私人和各机关捐赠或移交过来的。大多数古墓是基本建设工地的工人们在工作中发现的，他们发现古墓之后，都注意不使墓地受到损毁，主动地和文物管理委员会联系，并帮助挖掘。该市郊区的农民也将他们以往掘得的许多古物，交给了文物管理委员会。
