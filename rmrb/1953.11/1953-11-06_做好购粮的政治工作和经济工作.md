    Publicize the Benefits of Selling Grain to the State to Farmers
    The Financial and Economic Committee of the Zhengzhou Special District Commissioner's Office of the Henan Provincial People's Government, and the CCP committees of Changge and Xuchang counties in Xuchang Special District, recently dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to publicize the benefits of selling grain to the state to farmers. They held forums and discussions with farmers, using farmers' own experiences to educate and enlighten them. Some farmers, in discussing whether it was better to store grain or invest it in production, realized through careful calculation that turning dead grain into live money for investment in production was beneficial both to themselves and to national construction. Many farmers mentioned that after the wheat crop was hit by frost this spring, during the lean season, the state supplied a large amount of grain to help farmers overcome the disaster. Through these recollection sessions, farmers' awareness was raised, and they realized the benefits of selling grain to the state, both for the country and for themselves. As a result, the number of farmers selling grain in these areas has been increasing, and many farmers with enough grain have also invested the money they originally planned to buy and store grain in production. The amount of grain purchased by farmers in Changge County has decreased by 75 percent compared to before, and in Xuchang County by 67 percent. The amount of autumn grain entering the market in Shecunji, Huiguo Town, Zhengzhou Special District, has increased by 60 percent compared to before, and the amount of wheat entering the market has also increased by 10 percent. At the same time, farmers' demand for means of production has greatly increased. From October 7th to 13th, cooperatives in Xuchang County sold 354 waterwheels and 200,000 catties of fertilizer.

    Dispatch Goods to the Countryside Early
    In order to coordinate grain purchases and do a good job in supplying materials, the Jilin Provincial Company of the China Department Store held a forum for responsible cadres of its affiliated wholesale stations and wholesale stores in October, specifically to study how to ensure the supply of materials during grain purchases, and decided to allocate materials in advance.

    The forum decided that seasonal commodities, such as winter supplies, should be allocated by the end of October; goods that have not yet arrived should be expedited and allocated quickly; and general bulk commodities for winter should be allocated one month in advance according to supply contracts. After the meeting, the wholesale stations and wholesale stores have taken active action. (Lin Bin)

    Ensure Sufficient Funds for Grain Purchases
    Some cooperatives in Northeast China experienced a shortage of funds at the beginning of the peak grain purchase season. Some areas used "IOUs" to pay for grain purchases. For example, only nine cooperatives in Jixian County issued "IOUs" worth 330 million yuan. As a result, some farmers were waiting to see if the cooperatives had money before selling their grain.

    In order to ensure that there are sufficient funds for grain purchases in various places in the future, the Northeast Regional Branch of the People's Bank of China recently issued instructions requiring its subordinate banks at all levels to suggest that relevant departments adopt a "revolving fund system" so that cooperatives can maintain at least five days' worth of procurement revolving funds. At the same time, appropriately increase the business inventory limits of banks in key procurement areas. All branches and sub-branches must approve the allocation of funds applied for by lower-level banks as soon as they arrive. Staff members should be on duty outside of business hours, on Sundays, and holidays to handle the payment of procurement funds. In addition, banks at all levels should educate their staff to recognize the important significance of the state's acquisition of grain, and actively and regularly contact local trade, grain, and cooperative departments to study and solve problems such as fund supply under the leadership of the Financial and Economic Committee.

    Build Granaries to Welcome New Grain
    Grain departments in various provinces in Southwest China are stepping up the construction of new granaries to welcome new grain into storage. The simple storage warehouses built in the region this year are almost all over the region. The first batch of warehouse construction projects has been mostly completed. Recently, the Southwest Financial and Economic Leading Department has allocated a large amount of special funds for warehouse construction, and another batch of simple storage warehouses will be built on the land and water transportation lines in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan.

    In addition to building simple storage warehouses, Southwest China has also built more than 30 large-scale, durable warehouses this year. Some warehouses in Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces also have rice processing plants nearby. Most of these newly built warehouses are located in places with convenient transportation to facilitate farmers' transportation of grain. After the completion of all the granary construction projects, the total storage capacity of the region will be greatly increased.

    Add Purchasing Stations to Facilitate Farmers' Sale of Grain
    Pengxing District, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, has a total of seven market towns. In the past, the cooperatives in the district only set up grain purchasing points in four market towns. It was very inconvenient for farmers near the other three market towns to sell grain, and some speculators took the opportunity to buy at low prices, causing losses to the farmers.

    In October, the Pengxing District Cooperative added purchasing personnel and set up purchasing points in the other three market towns. This not only facilitated farmers' sale of grain, but also effectively combated the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants, which was warmly welcomed by the masses. Many farmers said: If you hadn't set up purchasing points, the unscrupulous merchants would have bought at a price of more than 100 yuan less per catty, and we don't know how much we would have lost!

    With the assistance of the state-owned trading company, the cooperative also enriched materials such as fertilizer and cloth, added department store outlets, and strengthened the supply of materials. At the same time, attention was paid to publicity work. The daily amount of grain purchased by the cooperative in the district was more than 11,000 catties at the end of September, and has now increased to more than 26,000 catties. (Zheng Zexi)

    Close Cooperation Between Departments
    Huanggang Special District, Hubei Province, has achieved considerable results in the autumn grain purchase work. One of their experiences is the close cooperation and coordinated action between departments. First of all, the relationship between the state-owned grain department and the cooperatives has been greatly improved. The state-owned grain department clearly recognizes the importance of relying on the cooperatives and provides convenience to the cooperatives in terms of transportation, storage capacity, reimbursement of expenses, and allocation of funds; the cooperatives also criticized the idea of ​​"helping" and actively carried out grain purchase work. State-owned commercial departments actively supply materials to cooperatives. For example, every time the Xinzhou County Cotton and Linen Company transported goods, they put all the samples out for the cooperatives to choose; the county's Oil Company once had only five barrels of oil left in the warehouse, and when the cooperatives needed it, they allocated it all to the cooperatives. Various departments of the cooperative system also cooperate closely. When setting up purchasing points, the supply and marketing departments of some county cooperatives uniformly allocated cadres, which solved the difficulty of insufficient manpower; at each purchasing point, the two departments implemented joint operations, so that "where there is purchasing, there is also supply." At the same time, for some goods, the county cooperative federation allowed the district-level cooperatives to purchase goods directly from the state-owned companies and the wholesale stations of the higher-level cooperatives, which shortened the allocation time and reduced costs. Thanks to the close cooperation between departments and the good work of material supply, according to statistics from Xinzhou, Xishui, Yangxin, Qichun and other counties, the total amount of currency recovered during grain purchases accounted for 71.29 percent of the total amount released.

    Combining Grain Purchases with Loan Recovery
    The Lipu District Cooperative and the local People's Bank business office in Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, in order to facilitate farmers' sale of grain and repayment of overdue agricultural loans, jointly organized mobile teams to conduct grain purchases and collect overdue loans in Lingyue and other townships, with good results.

    The mobile team, in coordination with local village cadres in Lingyue Township, publicized the importance of the state's purchase of grain and price policies such as "grading and pricing" to the farmers, and explained to the farmers that the recovery of agricultural loans was to continue to help farmers expand reproduction. The farmers actively sold grain and repaid overdue loans. Farmers in three administrative villages in the township sold more than 96,000 catties of rice in seven days. The mobile team purchased grain and collected overdue loans at the same time, saving farmers a lot of production time and labor. In Henglutang village alone, farmers saved 480 workdays of labor. Therefore, the mobile team was welcomed by the farmers. After gaining experience in Lingyue Township, the Lipu Cooperative and the People's Bank business office organized mobile teams to conduct grain purchases and recover loans in Donghu, Puhong and other townships.

### 做好购粮的政治工作和经济工作

    做好购粮的政治工作和经济工作
    向农民宣传把粮食卖给国家的好处
    河南省人民政府郑州专区专员公署财政经济委员会和许昌专区的长葛、许昌等县的中共党委，最近曾派了大批干部下乡向农民宣传把粮食卖给国家的好处。他们和农民举行座谈会、讨论会，用农民自己的体验教育启发农民。有些农民在座谈把粮食存起来好还是投入生产好的问题时，经过算细账，认识到把死粮变为活钱投入生产既有利于自己，又有利于国家建设。许多农民都谈到今春小麦受霜灾后，正是青黄不接的季节，当时国家大量供应了粮食，帮助农民渡过灾荒。通过这些回忆座谈，农民的觉悟有了提高，认识到把粮食出售给国家对国家对自己的好处。因而这些地区售粮的农民不断增加，许多粮食够用的农民，也把原来计划买粮储存的钱投入生产。长葛县农民每天买粮的数量已较前减少百分之七十五，许昌县较前减少百分之六十七。郑州专区回郭镇涉村集的秋粮上市量较前增加了百分之六十，小麦上市量也增加了百分之十。与此同时，农民对生产资料的需要量大有增加。许昌县合作社十月七日到十三日就卖出水车三百五十四部，肥料二十万斤。　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
    提早调拨货物下乡
    中国百货公司吉林省公司，为配合购粮作好物资供应工作，在十月间召开所属批发站和批发商店负责干部座谈会，对如何保证购粮中的物资供应工作专门作了研究，决定提前下拨物资。
    座谈会决定季节性商品，如御寒用品，十月底就拨完；未到商品，应快进快拨；冬季一般大宗商品，按供应合同，提前一个月下拨。会后，各批发站和批发商店已积极行动起来。　　　　　　　　（林彬）
    保证购粮资金充足
    东北区有的合作社在购粮旺季刚开始的时候，就出现了资金不足的现象。有的地区曾用“白条子”支付购粮款。如集贤县只九个合作社就发行了“白条子”三亿三千万元。因此，有些农民便在观望，等合作社有了钱再卖粮食。
    为了保证今后各地购粮中有充足的资金，中国人民银行东北区行日前发出指示，要求所属各级银行建议有关部门采用“周转金制”，使合作社至少经常保持有五天左右的采购周转资金。同时，适当地增加采购重点地区银行的业务库存限额。各分行、支行对下级行申请的拨款，须随到随批。营业时间以外及星期日、假日要设值班人员，办理采购款的支付工作。另外，各级银行应教育工作人员认清国家收购粮食的重要意义，并主动地经常和当地贸易、粮食、合作等部门联系，在财政经济委员会领导下研究和解决资金供应等问题。
    修建粮仓迎接新粮
    西南区各省粮食部门正加紧修建新粮仓，迎接新粮入库。今年该区修建的简易收纳仓库，几乎遍布全区各地。第一批建仓工程大部已竣工。最近，西南财经领导部门又拨了大批建仓专款，即将在四川、贵州、云南各地水陆交通线上兴修另一批简易收纳仓库。
    西南区除兴建简易收纳仓库外，今年还修建了三十多处规模较大、坚固耐久的仓库。云南、贵州等省有的仓库附近还建有大米加工厂。这些新建的仓库大部都在交通方便的地方，以便利农民运送粮食。修建粮仓工程全部完成以后，全区仓容量将大大增加。
    添设收购点便利农民卖粮
    湖北省孝感县朋兴区共有七个集镇。过去该区合作社只在四个集镇上设立了粮食收购点。其余三个集镇附近的农民，卖粮很不方便，有些投机私商便趁机压价收购，使农民受到损失。
    朋兴区合作社于十月间增添收购人员，在其余的三个集镇设立了收购点。这样既便利了农民卖粮，并有力地打击了奸商的投机活动，受到群众热烈拥护。许多农民说：假如你们再不设收购点，奸商用每斤贱一百多元的价钱收买，我们不知道要吃多大亏！
    该区合作社还在国营贸易公司协助下，充实肥料、布匹等物资，增设百货门市部，加强了物资供应工作。同时，注意进行了宣传工作。该区合作社每天收购粮食数量，九月底为一万一千多斤，目前已增加到二万六千多斤。　　　　　　（郑泽铣）
    各部门密切配合
    湖北省黄冈专区秋季购粮工作有不小的成绩。他们的经验之一是各部门密切配合，协同动作。首先是国营粮食部门和合作社的关系有了很大改进。国营粮食部门明确认识了依靠合作社的重要性，在调运、仓容、费用报销、资金调拨等方面，给合作社以便利；合作社也批判了“帮忙”的思想，积极开展购粮工作。国营商业部门都积极供应合作社以物资。如新洲县花纱布公司每次运到货物，都把样品全部摆出来，让合作社挑选；该县油脂公司有一次仓库里仅存油五桶，合作社需要，就全部拨给了合作社。合作社系统各部门也密切配合。有些县合作社的供应部门和推销部门，在设置收购点时，统一调配干部，解决了人力不足的困难；在各收购点，这两个部门实行联合营业，作到“收购在那里，供应也在那里”。同时，有些货物，县合作社联合社让区级合作社直接到国营公司、上级合作社的批发站进货，这样既缩短了调拨时间，又降低了成本。由于各部门密切配合，物资供应工作作得好，据新洲、浠水、阳新、蕲春等县统计，购粮中回笼货币总额占投放总额百分之七十一点二九。（王本直）
    购粮和收回贷款工作相结合
    浙江省金华县澧浦区合作社和当地人民银行营业所，为便利农民卖粮和归还到期农业贷款，共同组织流动小组到灵岳等乡进行购粮和收回到期贷款工作，效果很好。
    这个流动小组在灵岳乡配合当地乡村干部，向农民宣传了国家收购粮食的重要意义和“分等论价”等价格政策，向农民说明了收回农业贷款是为了继续帮助农民扩大再生产，农民们都踊跃出售粮食和归还到期贷款。该乡三个行政村的农民，七天中就出售稻谷九万六千多斤。流动小组一面购粮，一面收回到期贷款，节省了农民很多生产时间和劳动力。仅横路塘一个村，农民就节省了四百八十个工的劳动力。因此，流动小组受到了农民的欢迎。澧浦合作社和人民银行营业所在灵岳乡取得经验后，又组织流动小组到东湖、蒲洪等乡进行了购粮和收回贷款工作。
