Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 14th. The explanation work remains suspended for the seventh consecutive day. Today, returning Korean People's Army prisoners of war exposed new crimes committed by U.S. special agents in Panmunjom, who brutally murdered prisoners of war seeking repatriation who attempted to break through the special agent's control. Their accusations prove that U.S. special agents are taking advantage of the suspension of explanation work to intensify their reign of terror over the prisoners of war. These special agents receive instructions through radios supplied by the U.S. side, plotting and arranging various conspiracies, making it impossible to carry out the explanation work and completely depriving the prisoners of war of their right to repatriation.

While directing the special agents in the POW camps to carry out its plan to force a complete halt to the explanation work, the U.S. side is clamoring about "releasing" these prisoners of war when the "deadline" arrives. Far East U.S. Army Commander General Hull told an International News Service reporter on the 13th that the U.S. side will "absolutely" demand the "release" of all un-repatriated prisoners of war on January 23rd.

These facts once again demonstrate that the U.S. authorities and the special agents under their command are colluding both inside and outside the POW camps to sabotage the explanation work in order to achieve the goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

　　十四日解释工作继续停顿
    【新华社开城十四日电】十四日是解释工作连续停顿的第七天。今日归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员在板门店揭露了美方特务残杀企图突破特务控制要求遣返的战俘的新的罪行。他们的控诉证明，美方特务正在利用解释工作的停顿来加紧对战俘的恐怖统治，这些特务通过美方供给的无线电机接受指示，策划和布置种种阴谋，使解释工作根本不能进行，战俘的遣返权利被彻底剥夺。
    美方一面指使战俘营中的特务执行其迫使解释工作完全停顿的计划，一面叫喊到“期”就要“释放”这些战俘。远东美军总司令赫尔十三日对国际新闻社记者发表谈话说：美方将“绝对地”要求在一月二十三日“释放”一切未遣返的战俘。
    这些事实再次说明：美方当局及其指挥下的特务正在战俘营内外里应外合地破坏解释工作以便达到强迫扣留战俘的目的。
