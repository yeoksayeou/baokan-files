The relationship between cadres and the masses in the vast rural areas of Sichuan Province has become increasingly close after the completion of the first phase of the general election, and the efficiency of basic-level governments has generally improved.

After the general election, the township people's governments have paid great attention to the production of the masses, changing the previous phenomenon of chaos and multiple leadership in rural work. In the past, the organizational structure of basic-level governments in rural Sichuan Province was complex. Some townships had as many as 20 standing committees. The main cadres of the township sometimes had to hold multiple positions, and therefore could not concentrate on leading production. After the general election, the township people's governments generally set up only seven specialized committees: production and construction, public security and defense, culture and education, health, civil affairs, mediation, armed forces, and finance and food. Cadres generally hold one position (a few cadres hold two positions). This allows cadres to have more time to participate in production, lead production, and concentrate on solving major problems for the masses in a timely manner. For example, a few days ago, Yong'an Township, Jiangyou County, had a torrential rain, and the Daughter Embankment was washed away by floods for more than six feet, and it was seen that the irrigation of more than 10,000 mu of paddy fields would be affected. The township's Production and Construction Committee quickly mobilized the masses to repair it and invited water conservancy cadres to guide it. It was repaired within three days. When the autumn corn in Xihe Township, Nanjiang County, an old revolutionary base area on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, matured, wild animals caused great harm. The Public Security and Defense Committee promptly organized eight hunting teams, which killed thirteen leopards, wild boars, hedgehogs, etc. in a few days. People's representatives of Sanhe Village, Jinquan Township, Langzhong County, did not pay attention to leading the masses to store water in the past, so water shortages occurred every spring. This year, they led the farmers to plow the fields while closely storing water. Now, the paddy fields in the whole village are full of water.

People's representatives not only care about the production of the masses, but also attach importance to solving the difficulties in the daily life of the masses. Damuchang in Fuling County is a market. Before liberation, due to the burning, killing and looting by bandits led by Lang Youcheng, the nearby farmers did not dare to do business here, and went to Baolan Town, sixty miles away, which was very inconvenient. Now the township people's representatives quickly restored this market according to the requirements of the masses. Luo Jinlu, a farmer in San Village, had a sick grandson before liberation. He ran to Shawochang, dozens of miles away, to buy medicine. By the time he returned home, his grandson had already died. Now that he sees this market restored, he sincerely thanks this group of newly elected representatives.

The general election movement has also educated the vast number of grassroots cadres. After the general election, many cadres further realized that they can only do a good job by relying on the masses. Ding Tianzheng, chairman of the Farmers' Association of Yong'an Township, Jiangyou County, had a bad work style in the past. He always rushed to arrange work and lost his temper if the masses did not accept it. After the general election, he corrected his shortcomings and discussed things with the masses. Recently, when the village distributed living allowances to revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents, he and the village chief Fan Furong first went deep into the masses to publicize the people's government's policies for revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents, and then launched the preferential treatment group to discuss it. Therefore, the masses are satisfied. Baiyu Village, Xianhe Township, Lezhi County, could not plow the autumn fields due to lack of rain a few days ago. People's representative Yang Changzhen discussed with several old farmers in the village how to solve the problem of water shortage for plowing. The farmers saw that the cadres went deep into the masses to solicit opinions, and also provided their own production experience. Farmer Wu Zilang suggested: "My fields have deeper water, so let's release some water to Du Feiwu first, wouldn't that solve the problem!" Du Feiwu was very happy and decided to release the water to the fields of military dependent Jiang Xushi after plowing, so the difficulty of plowing in the autumn drought was solved by the method of "exchanging water for plowing."

Because people's representatives and cadres can care about the suffering of the masses, the masses love their government more, unite more closely around the people's government, actively respond to the call of the people's government, and conscientiously implement the resolutions of the township people's congress. Farmers in Tianchi Township, Yibin County, responded to the call of the township people's congress and cleared the township's loan of 20 million yuan within ten days after the autumn harvest. In response to the call of the Fushou Township People's Congress in Guanghan County to "plow the fields early and cultivate deeply," the farmers in the township finished plowing the first time for the spring fields and winter water fields at the end of September, half a month earlier than in previous years, and generally cultivated one inch deeper than in previous years. After the Production and Construction Committee of the Youqing Township People's Government in Qu County issued a call for weeding and accumulating fertilizer, the farmers in Yunxiu and Xinong villages quickly took the time to shovel more than 8,000 loads of grass fertilizer.

    四川省普选后基层政权的工作效能提高
    四川省广大农村在第一期普选结束后，干部和群众的关系日趋密切，基层政权的效能普遍提高。
    普选后的乡人民政府，以极大的注意力关心群众的生产，改变了过去农村工作中的忙乱和多头领导的现象。过去，四川省农村中基层政权的组织机构庞杂，有的乡各种常设委员会有二十个之多，乡里主要干部有时不得不身兼数职，因而不能集中精力领导生产。普选后的乡人民政府，一般只设生产建设、治安保卫、文教卫生、民政、调解、武装、财粮等七个专门委员会，干部一般地是一人一职（少数干部兼一个职务）。这样就使干部有更多的时间来参加生产，领导生产，集中精力及时为群众解决重大的问题。如江油县永安乡前些日子下了暴雨，女儿堰被洪水冲垮了六丈多长，眼看一万多亩水田的灌溉将受到影响。乡生产建设委员会迅速发动群众抢修，并邀请水利干部指导，三天内就把它抢修好了。川陕边界的老根据地南江县西河乡秋包谷成熟的时候，野兽为害很大。治安保卫委员及时组织了八个打猎队，几天内就打死了十三只豹子、野猪、刺猬等。阆中县金泉乡三和村的人民代表，过去不经常注意领导群众蓄水，以致年年春天都发生缺水的现象；今年，他们领导农民一面犁坂田，一面抓紧蓄水。现在，全村的水田都已积满了水。
    人民代表不仅关心群众的生产，而且还重视解决群众日常生活中的困难。涪陵县的大木场是一个集市，解放前因土匪朗友成的烧杀抢掠，附近的农民不敢在这里做生意，都到六十里外的包兰镇去赶场，很不方便；现在乡人民代表根据群众的要求，迅速恢复了这个集市。三村农民罗金禄解放前孙儿生病，他曾跑到几十里以外的沙窝场买药，等他回到家时，孙儿已经死了。现在他看到这个场又恢复了，从心眼里感谢这批新选的代表。
    普选运动也教育了广大基层干部。许多干部在普选后，进一步认识到只有依靠群众才能做好工作。江油县永安乡农会主席丁天正，过去作风不好，平常布置工作时总是贪多贪快，如果群众不接受，他就发脾气。普选后他改正了自己的缺点，有事便和群众商量。最近村里发放烈属军属生活补助费，他和村长范福荣首先深入群众宣传了人民政府对烈属军属的政策，以后又发动优抚小组进行讨论。因此，群众都表示满意。乐至县仙鹤乡白玉村，前些日子因天不下雨，秋田没法下犁，人民代表杨长贞便和村上几个老农民商量解决犁田缺水的问题。农民看到干部深入群众征求意见，也把自己的生产经验提供出来。农民吴自郎出主意说：“我的田水深一些，先放些水给杜飞武，不就把问题解决了吗！”杜飞武很高兴，决定犁田后把水放到军属江徐氏的田里，这样，就用“换水犁田”的办法，解决了秋旱犁田的困难。
    由于人民代表、干部能关心群众疾苦，群众更加热爱自己的政权，更加紧密地团结在人民政府周围，积极响应人民政府的号召，认真执行乡人民代表大会的决议。宜宾县天池乡农民响应乡人民代表大会的号召，在秋收后十天内，就还清了全乡二千万元的贷款。广汉县福寿乡农民为响应乡人民代表大会“及早犁田，适当深耕”的号召，九月底全乡的小春田和冬水田都犁完了第一遍，比往年提早半个月，并普遍较往年深耕一寸。渠县友庆乡人民政府生产建设委员会发出关于除草积肥的号召以后，云岫、新农两村的农民就迅速抽空铲了八千多挑草肥。
