Crisis Symptoms in the American Economy
Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Ai. Varga

    The signs of a crisis in the American economy due to overproduction are so obvious that people are openly talking about it. The questions discussed in American newspapers and economic magazines are: When will the long-anticipated decline in economic activity begin? What depth will it have?

    The "U.S. News & World Report" of August 7 wrote: "It is now generally accepted that the end of prosperity [Note 1] is coming. The only argument is when this end will become more obvious. Eisenhower's economic advisors told him that the economic recession [Note 2] will occur in early 1954, not at the end of 1953. Other experts in government departments and private enterprises believe that in the last three months of this year, people will see signs of recession."

    It can be seen from this that both statements predict that the "prosperity" will end in a few months. But when it comes to the depth of this economic recession, the American bourgeois press asserts and reassures its readers that this economic "recession" will be "not profound."

    The above-mentioned magazine wrote: "The general level of business activity will decrease by an average of about 10%; more in some sectors and less in others."

    Needless to say, these similar predictions must be viewed with suspicion: the organs of the American monopoly capital certainly do not want to admit that this business decline will be profound and lasting. Because if such an announcement is made, it will cause panic in the stock exchange, a plunge in prices, a reduction in commodity sales, in a word, a sharp intensification of crisis symptoms.

    (1)

    The question arises: Why do American newspapers report so much about the impending economic difficulties caused by overproduction? It should be known that the industrial production in the United States in the first half of 1953 was higher than in any year after 1943:

    Industrial Production Index compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank
    (with 1935-39 as 100)
    1943　       239
    1949　       176
    1950　       200
    1951　       220
    1952 　      219
    First half of 1953 　238

    At first glance, the continuous growth of the industrial production index seems to indicate that American industrialists can be free from anxiety.

    But this is not the case. The rapid growth of the production index only powerfully confirms the correctness of Marx's basic principles of the theory of production and crisis. It is well known that the production level is the highest precisely on the eve of the economic crisis. Marx's theory has been proven by the history of world economic crises for the past century.

    Bourgeois economists try to refute Marx's theory of crisis and cycles - the only correct theory, according to which a scientific observation of the process of capitalist economic life can be made. But even bourgeois scholars have to pay attention to the facts. And many facts are proving that the "prosperity" is coming to an end, and the signals of the approaching economic crisis are becoming clearer and clearer.

    Here are some facts.

    For a long time, large quantities of manufactured goods have no longer reached consumers, but have been piled up in the warehouses of various enterprises, wholesale and retail trade organizations, in the hands of farmers, and in national warehouses. For example, according to the materials of the US Department of Commerce, between the end of July 1952 and the end of July 1953, the inventory of wholesale and retail industries and the inventory in the hands of manufacturers increased by 6 billion US dollars (increased by 600 million US dollars in July alone!), thus making the total amount reached a huge number of 77.3 billion US dollars.

    The magnitude of this number can be explained by the following fact: it exceeds the total output value of American industry in 1949 - estimated at 75.4 billion US dollars.

    In addition to these private and company inventories, the government also stores a large number of industrial products - mainly strategic materials - from ships and non-ferrous metals to petroleum products and military supplies.

    (2)

    In recent years, large quantities of agricultural products have been piled up in farmers' barns and national warehouses. By the beginning of April 1953, these accumulated agricultural products totaled (in millions of US dollars):

    In national warehouses In farmers' barns
    Corn　 410　 316
    Wheat　 284 　817
    Cotton 　32   　250
    Tobacco 　1     　266
    Others 　394 　171

    That is to say, even before this year's harvest, unsalable agricultural products worth about 3 billion US dollars have been piled up in national warehouses, which is twice the amount a year ago. In addition, farmers and merchants also store large amounts of unsold products.

    In order to maintain the prices of agricultural products artificially for the benefit of large farmers and flour companies, the state has set up special institutions for purchasing agricultural products. However, overproduction is so great that although the state purchases, the wholesale prices of grain are still beginning to decline:

    Wholesale prices of agricultural products
    (Price index with 1947-49 as 100)
    1951         　113.4
    1952         　107
    1953 (June)　 95.3

    In order to maintain a high price level, agricultural monopoly capitalists, while exerting influence on the US Department of Agriculture, have also tried their best to advocate a referendum on artificially reducing the wheat planting area. Agricultural monopoly capitalists and officials of the Department of Agriculture insisted that they took this measure because of the wheat "surplus." They said such things at a time when millions of working people in capitalist countries are actually starving, and even former US President Truman had to admit that one-third of the residents of the United States eat very badly!

    The total backlog of goods in the United States can be estimated at about 100 billion US dollars, which is at least twice the number required for normal reproduction.

    Unless industrial production is drastically reduced and prices are greatly lowered, these "surplus" items will not be sold.

    Industrial orders are obviously decreasing. Unfulfilled industrial order contracts were cut by 1 billion US dollars in June. The first to be cut are the first-class commodities, namely the means of production, especially lathes. The total value of orders in June this year was lower than in the same period last year. Many orderers also have to withdraw and cancel their orders.

    In recent years, more and more consumer goods in the United States have been sold on the installment payment system, relying on the future purchasing power of consumers. Obviously, the goods sold in this way are not real sales. After a crisis occurs in reproduction and income and wages inevitably decline, most buyers will not be able to pay the debts due. And according to American law, houses, cars, televisions, furniture and other goods sold on the installment system will still belong to the creditors.

    Total consumer debt
    (Unit: billion US dollars, calculated at the end of the year)
    Total Installment Debt
    1949　        17.1　11.5
    1950　        20.8　14.5
    1951　        21.5　14.8
    1952　        25.7　18.6
    1953 (July)  27.2　20.9

    Obviously, in the past year and a half, installment debt has increased by 6.1 billion US dollars. This number greatly exceeds the total amount of installment debt at the end of 1939 - which was 4.5 billion US dollars.

    (3)

    Although the output is still very high, wholesale prices have recently shown a downward trend. The rate of price decline is extremely uneven. At first glance, the official prices of the products of those enterprises that have obtained the most military orders and are the most monopolistic have not fallen:

    Price Index
    (with 1947-49 as 100, calculated at the end of the year and the end of the month)
     1951　             1952  1953
                                        (June)
    All products 114.8　      111.6  109.4
    Agricultural products 113.4　        107      95.3
    Textiles 110.6    　    99.8    97.5
    Metals and their products 122.8  123　    126.8
    Machines 119                121.5  122.8

    Therefore, according to the figures in this statistical table, it seems that the monopoly capitalists who own heavy industrial enterprises could still keep prices at a high level before the end of June. But this is not the case. The actual situation is: big monopoly capitalists are unwilling to lower prices publicly. When they lower prices, they prefer to take roundabout methods. When supply is less than demand, they sell their goods at prices higher than the official prices under the items of "emergency supply", "premium quality", etc., and get extra income. For example, this was the case in the steel industry before the middle of this year. However, according to a report in the June issue of the "Statistician" magazine, as early as the beginning of June this year, Fairless, the manager of "U.S. Steel Corporation", had declared: "The period of 'forced acceptance of high prices' has ended. From now on, we will charge all buyers the same price."

    When supply exceeds demand, monopoly capitalists secretly sell their goods at prices lower than the official prices by using various discounts.

    Particularly interesting is the situation in the American automobile market. In the first half of 1953, the American automobile industry produced 1.06 million more passenger cars than in the same period in 1952. But the sales of cars have become very difficult. Although car merchants - actually agents of big monopoly capitalists - still have to get cars from their owners at the previous prices. But it is absolutely impossible to sell cars at the previous prices. Merchants are forced to sacrifice the commissions they deserve to reduce prices. The Swiss "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" of July 26 said: "Some car merchants publicly stated in the newspapers that they sell new cars for 300 US dollars cheaper than the official price set by the factory owner."

    In addition, the crisis in the sales of old cars has also added to the difficulty of selling new cars. In the United States, buyers of new cars usually use their old cars to pay part of the price of new cars, and they sell their old cars to car merchants. The purchasers of old cars are the lower-income strata of the residents. However, due to the deterioration of living conditions, they can no longer afford old cars. Therefore, according to the materials on the "Automotive News" bulletin, the price of old cars has fallen by 20% within a year, and according to other reports, it has fallen by 30%. Car merchants are accumulating more and more old cars: as of the end of May, their accumulation was 27% more than a year ago.

    The deteriorating market conditions in the United States have forced monopoly capitalists to openly reduce prices one after another in the third quarter. "Chrysler Corporation," one of the three largest automobile companies in the United States, had already lowered its prices in March. "U.S. Steel Corporation" lowered the price of pig iron by 5% to 7% in September. Oil trusts lowered the selling price of gasoline, and price reductions also occurred in other areas.

    An important sign of the impending crisis of overproduction is that the price of steel bars began to fall in August this year - this is the first time this year. The decline in the price of steel bars is often a precursor to the decline in steel production.

    In the third quarter, industrial production began to decline. The industrial production index for this year began to decline for the first time in July - from 242 to 233. American "optimists" say: This is because summer is the off-season. But the expected surge in production in August and September did not appear. According to preliminary statistics, the index in September was 234. There are more and more reports about production tightening. For example, steel production has maintained a 100% operating rate this year, but in the third week of August, the operating rate dropped to 87.3%. Major companies manufacturing agricultural machinery - "International Harvester," "Caterpillar Tractor" and others - announced production cuts in August. The production of trucks has also been reduced. According to the "Times" of September 14, many automobile factories - including those belonging to "General Motors" - reduced the production of passenger cars. "General Motors" reduced the production of diesel locomotives and other products.

    On the stock exchange, the prices of stocks of industrial enterprises have been falling for a long time, which is a sure sign that the crisis is coming. The index of the average price of stocks of 30 major industrial enterprises compiled by Dow Jones fell from 295 at the beginning of this year to 255 in mid-September. In August and September, the continuous decline in stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange was almost panic-like. In mid-September, stock prices fell to their lowest level in 16 months.

    The decline in stock prices means that monopoly capitalists foresee the arrival of the economic crisis and are prepared to use it to "make money." When stock prices are still relatively high, they sell part of their stocks in succession, so that when stock prices plummet due to the arrival of the crisis, they can buy them back at low prices.

    (4)

    American "optimists" say that the "employment" figures for August are an unprecedented record in the United States, and the number of unemployed has been reduced to 1.24 million.

    But everyone knows that American unemployment and employment statistics are deceptive. Their basis is a survey of a few thousand selected workers, and the survey results are regarded as the general situation of millions of workers across the country. Anyone who has a place to work but no work, and who is allowed (!) to get work in the coming month, and even people who only work one hour a week, are not counted as unemployed workers.

    The US "Bureau of the Census" conducted a survey of the situation of working hours in the middle of this year. From the report of the Bureau, it can be seen how absurdly the American labor force is used by capitalists:

    Weekly working hours
    Hours Number of workers (unit: thousand people)
    90 or more　  250
    70-89  1180
    55-69  3242
    41-54  14036
    40　      23946
    30-39  4576
    22-29  1746
    15-21  1962
    1-14    2074

    That is to say, on the one hand, there are more than 4.6 million workers who have to work more than 9 hours to more than 15 hours a day. On the other hand, the working hours of 8.3 million workers are reduced to only 2 and a half hours to 6 and a half hours per day, and nearly 2.1 million workers are almost unemployed. They only have a few hours of temporary work a week.

    In order to reduce the number of unemployed workers during the economic crisis, the US authorities advised American capitalists not to lay off workers under the condition of constantly deteriorating economic conditions, but to "average" the work among the workers. But the desire to pursue profits does not allow this to be done. In Detroit, workers have begun to be laid off in factories producing agricultural machinery and other factories.

    The reactionary magazine "Fortune" predicted in its September issue that due to the increasingly serious economic crisis, the number of unemployed will increase to 7 million.

    What particularly makes American "experts" uneasy is the economic consequences of the Korean armistice and the possibility of reducing military orders (even if this possibility is not great).

    As early as April, when the Soviet Union proposed signing a Korean armistice agreement, the "Boston Herald" wrote on April 23: "From all sides, we have heard such statements: Real peace will make us lose our foothold, and will put the United States into such a serious crisis that our system will be fatally endangered.... We cannot afford peace.... The fear we have of the crisis is so strong that we can say: We are as afraid of it as we are of the World War itself...."

    Statements like this have often appeared in American newspapers. American capitalism has become so corrupt that the spokespersons of the big capitalists are almost openly advocating a new world war as a means of overcoming the economic crisis.

              ★★★

    These facts and figures show that in the United States, a crisis of overproduction is approaching.

    The increasing number of uneasy arguments in newspapers and magazines, as well as bourgeois economists and political commentators, fully shows that American monopoly capitalists are frightened by the impending American economic crisis. They are trying to overcome this crisis by stepping up the arms race.

    But this method has never allowed capitalist countries to escape the inevitable crisis. It will not allow the United States to escape either. On the contrary, this method will inevitably make the contradictions of capitalism more acute and more intense.

    [Note 1] The United States calls the period of high production and commodity circulation "prosperity."
    [Note 2] Bourgeois economists and political commentators are afraid to mention the crisis phenomena in the American economy, so they adopted the term "economic recession," which they believe is as if the "economic recession" is caused by the industry's need to "adapt" to market needs.

    美国经济中的危机征象
    苏联科学院院士  埃·瓦尔加
    美国经济中由于生产过剩而引起的危机的征象，已经这样明显，以致人们都在公开谈论它了。美国报纸和经济杂志讨论的问题是：早已预料到的经济活动的低落何时开始？它将具有怎样一种深度？
    八月七日的“美国新闻与世界报道”写道：“现在大家公认，繁荣〔注一〕的尾声即将来临。争论仅在于这个尾声什么时候变得更明显。艾森豪威尔的经济问题顾问告诉他说，经济衰退〔注二〕现象将在一九五四年初出现，而不会在一九五三年底出现。另外一些政府部门和私人企业的专家们则认为，在今年的最后三个月里，人们就会看到衰退现象。”
    由此可见，这两种说法都预告了，在几个月之后，“繁荣”即将结束。但是在谈到这次经济衰退的深度时，美国资产阶级报刊就都断言并安慰自己的读者说，这次的经济“衰退”将是“不深刻的”。
    上述杂志写道：“商业活动的一般水平平均要降低约百分之十；在某些部门里要大一些，在某些部门里则小一些。”
    不消说，对待这些类似的预言是必须加以怀疑的：美国垄断资本的机关刊物当然不肯承认这次商业活动的低落将是深刻的和长久的。因为如果这样宣布，就会引起交易所的慌张，物价的暴跌，商品销售量的缩减，一句话，引起危机征象的剧烈尖锐化。
    （一）
    问题发生了：为什么美国报刊报道这样多的关于由生产过剩而引起的即将来临的经济困难呢？要知道，美国在一九五三年上半年的工业生产是比一九四三年以后的任何一年都要高的：
    联邦储备银行所编制的工业生产指数
    （以一九三五—三九年为一○○）
    一九四三年　       二三九
    一九四九年　       一七六
    一九五○年　       二○○
    一九五一年　       二二○
    一九五二年 　      二一九
    一九五三年上半年 　二三八
    蓦然一看，工业生产指数的不断增长，似乎表明了美国工业家满可以不必惶恐不安了。
    但是事情并非如此。生产指数的迅速增长，只是有力地证实了马克思关于生产与危机学说基本原理的正确性。人们都知道，恰恰在经济危机前夕，生产水平是最高的。马克思的学说已为一百年来世界经济危机的历史所证明。
    资产阶级经济学家力图反驳马克思关于危机与周期的理论——这是唯一正确的理论，根据这一理论就能够对资本主义经济生活的进程作一科学的观察。但是，即便是资产阶级的学者们也不得不注意到事实。而许多事实正证明着“繁荣”即将结束，经济危机逼近的信号越来越清楚了。
    下面就是一些事实。
    很久以来，大批制成品已不再到达消费者的手里，而是堆积在各种企业的堆栈、批发与零售贸易机构里，堆积在农场主手里以及国家的堆栈中。例如，根据美国商务部的材料，在一九五二年七月底到一九五三年七月底之间，批发与零售业的存货以及制造商手头的存货增加了六十亿美元（仅七月份就增加了六亿美元！）从而使总数达到七百七十三亿美元的庞大数目。
    这个数目之大可由下面的事实说明：它超过了一九四九年美国工业的生产总值——据估计是七百五十四亿美元。
    除了这些私人和公司的存货以外，政府还储存着大量工业品——主要是战略物资——从轮船和有色金属到石油产品和军用品。
    （二）
    在最近几年中，无论是农场主的谷仓里还是国家的仓库里，都堆积着大批的农产品。到一九五三年四月初，这些堆积的农产品共计（以百万美元计）：
    在国家仓库中在农场主谷仓中
    玉蜀黍　 四一○　 三一六
    小麦　   二八四 　八一七
    棉花   　三二   　二五○
    烟草   　一     　二六六
    其他   　三九四 　一七一
    这就是说，还在今年收割以前，在全国仓库里已经堆积着价值约三十亿美元的滞销的农产品，这个数目是一年前的两倍。此外，在农民和商人手里还储存着大量未出售的产品。
    国家为了大农场主和面粉公司的利益，人为地保持农产品的价格，设立了收购农产品的特殊机构。但是，生产过剩是这样大，虽然国家收购，粮食的批发价格仍然开始下降：
    农产品批发价格
    （价格指数以一九四七—四九年为一○○）
    一九五一年         　一一三·四
    一九五二年         　一○七
    一九五三年（六月）　 九五·三
    为了保持高的价格水平，农业垄断资本家在对美国农业部施以影响的同时，又竭力主张进行关于人为地缩小小麦种植面积的公民投票。农业垄断资本家和农业部的官员们硬说，他们采取这种措施是由于小麦“过剩”。他们说这样的话，是在这样的时候，即资本主义国家中，千百万的劳动人民实际上在挨饿，连前美国总统杜鲁门也不得不承认，美国三分之一的居民吃得很坏！
    美国全部积压商品可以估计为大约价值一千亿美元，这至少是正常的再生产过程所需要的数目的两倍。
    除非大量削减工业生产量，大大地降低价格，这些“剩余”物品将无法卖掉。
    工业订货显然正在减少。六月份没有履行的工业订货合同削减了十亿美元。首先遭到削减的是第一类商品，即生产资料，特别是车床。今年六月份订货总值比去年同期降低了。许多订货者还要撤回和取消自己的订货。
    在最近几年中，美国越来越多的消费品都是以分期付款的赊购制度，依靠消费者的未来的购买力而卖出的。显然，这样卖出的商品并不是真正的销售。在再生产发生危机和收入与工资不可免地下降以后，大部分购买者就将不能偿付到期的债务。而根据美国的法律，房屋、汽车、电视机、家具和其他一些以赊购制度所卖出的商品，仍将归债权者所有。
    消费者债务总额
    （单位十亿美元，以年底计算）
    总额分期付款的债务
    一九四九年　        一七·一　一一·五
    一九五○年　        二○·八　一四·五
    一九五一年　        二一·五　一四·八
    一九五二年　        二五·七　一八·六
    一九五三年（七月）  二七·二　二○·九
    显而易见，在最近一年半中，分期付款的债务增加了六十一亿美元。这个数目大大地超过了一九三九年底分期付款的债务总额——那时是四十五亿美元。
    （三）
    虽然生产量仍然很高，但批发价格最近却呈现下降趋势。价格下降的速度极不平衡。骤然看来，那些获得军事订货最多、最具有独占性的企业部门，它们的产品的公定价格还没有下降：
    价格指数
    （以一九四七—四九年为一○○，以年底和月底计算）
     一九五一年　             一九五二年  一九五三年
                                        （六月）
    全部产品一一四·八　      一一一·六  一○九·四
    农产品一一三·四　        一○七      九五·三
    纺织品一一○·六    　    九九·八    九七·五
    金属及其制成品一二二·八  一二三　    一二六·八
    机器一一九                一二一·五  一二二·八
    因此，依照这个统计表上的数字看来，拥有重工业企业的垄断资本家似乎在六月底以前还能使价格保持着在高的水平上。但事实并不如此。实际情况是：大垄断资本家不愿意公开地降低价格。他们在降低价格时，宁愿采取迂回的方法。当供不应求时，他们在“紧急供应”、“特等质量”等等项目下，以高于公定价格的价格出售自己的商品，得到了额外的收入。例如，在今年年中以前，钢铁方面的情况就是这样。但是，据“统计家”杂志在六月的一期中报道，早在今年六月月初，“美国钢铁公司”经理费尔勒就曾经宣称：“‘强迫接受高价’的时期已经终结了。今后我们向一切购买者索取的将是同等的价格。”
    当供过于求时，垄断资本家就暗地里用种种折扣的方法，以低于公定价格的价格出售自己的商品。
    特别有趣的是美国汽车市场方面的情况。在一九五三年上半年，美国汽车工业生产的客车比一九五二年同期多一百零六万辆。但是汽车的销售却已经变为非常困难的事情。虽然汽车商人——实际上是大垄断资本家的代理人——仍然不得不依照以前的价格从自己的主人那里拿到汽车。可是要想依照以前的价格出售汽车已经绝对不可能了。商人们被迫牺牲他们所应得的佣金，来减价出售。七月二十六日的瑞士“新苏黎世报”说：“有些汽车商人公开地在报纸上声称，他们出售的新汽车比工厂主规定的公定价格便宜三百美元。”
    此外，旧汽车销售方面的危机也给新汽车的销售增加了困难。在美国，新汽车的买主通常是用他们的旧汽车来偿付新汽车的价款的一部分，他们把自己的旧汽车卖给汽车商人。旧汽车的购买者是居民中收入不多的阶层。但由于生活状况的恶化，他们已买不起旧汽车。因此，根据“汽车新闻”公报上的材料，旧汽车的价格在一年之内下跌了百分之二十，根据其他方面的报道则下跌了百分之三十。汽车商人手中积存的旧汽车越来越多了：截至五月底为止，它们的积存量比一年以前多了百分之二十七。
    美国市场状况的日趋恶化迫使垄断资本家接二连三地在第三季度公开地减低价格。美国三个最大的汽车公司之一——“克莱斯勒汽车公司”，在三月间已经降低了自己的价格。“美国钢铁公司”于九月间将铣铁的价格降低了百分之五到百分之七。石油托辣斯降低了汽油的售价，在其他方面也同样发生了减价的事情。
    生产过剩危机即将到来的重要标志是：钢条的价格在今年八月间开始下跌——这是今年来的第一次。钢条价格的下跌经常是钢铁生产下降的预兆。
    在第三季度，工业生产开始下跌。今年以来的工业生产指数，在七月份第一次开始下降——从二百四十二降到二百三十三。美国的“乐观主义者”说：这因为夏季是淡季。可是期望发生于八、九两月的生产高涨并没有出现。据初步统计，九月份的指数是二百三十四。关于生产紧缩的报道已越来越多了。例如，钢铁生产今年原来一直保持百分之百的开工率，但在八月的第三个星期，开工率降低到百分之八十七点三。制造农业机器的大公司——“国际收割机公司”、“履带拖拉机公司”和其他公司，都在八月份宣布了削减生产。卡车的生产量也削减了。据九月十四日的“泰晤士报”报道，许多汽车工厂——其中包括“通用汽车公司”所属工厂——减少了客车的生产量。“通用汽车公司”减少了柴油机车及其他产品的生产量。
    在证券交易所里，工业企业股票的价格长期以来一直在下跌，这是预示危机即将到来的肯定征象。道·约翰逊所编制的三十个主要工业企业的股票平均价格的指数从今年年初的二百九十五下降到九月中旬的二百五十五。在八、九两月内，纽约证券交易所发生的股票价格的不断下跌，几乎是具有恐慌的性质。在九月中旬，股票价格降低到了十六个月以来的最低水平。
    股票价格的下跌意味着垄断资本家预见到经济危机的到来，并准备利用它来“赚钱”。当股票的价格还比较高的时候，他们陆续卖出自己的一部分股票，以便在股票价格因危机来临而急剧下跌的时候，用低廉的价格再把它们买回来。
    （四）
    美国的“乐观主义者”说，八月份的“就业”数字是美国的空前纪录，失业人数已经降低到了一百二十四万人。
    但是谁都知道，美国的失业与就业统计是骗人的。它们的根据是对挑选出来的几千个工人的调查，把调查结果当作全国千百万工人的普遍状况。凡是有工作地点而无工作的、和被允许（！）在行将到来的一个月内获得工作的以及甚至每周只有一小时工作的人，都不算作失业工人。
    美国“国情普查局”曾对今年年中工作时间的状况作了一番调查，从该局的报告中可以看出美国的劳动力被资本家利用到如何荒谬的地步：
    每周工作时数
    小时数工人人数（单位千人）

    这就是说，一方面，有四百六十多万工人每天要工作九小时以上至十五小时以上，另一方面，有八百三十万工人每周的工作时间被缩短到每天只有二小时半至六小时半，另外有近二百一十万工人简直等于失业，他们每周只有几小时的临时性工作。
    为了减少经济危机时期内失业工人的数目，美国当局劝告美国资本家在经济情况不断恶化的条件下不要解雇工人，而要在工人中间“平均”分配工作。但是追求利润的欲望是不容许这样做的。在底特律，在生产农业机器的工厂及其他工厂已开始解雇工人。
    反动杂志“幸福”在九月的一期中预测说，由于经济危机的现象日趋严重，失业人数将增加到七百万。
    特别使美国的“专家”们感到不安的是朝鲜停战的经济后果和军事订货缩减的可能性（即使这种可能性并不大）。
    早在四月间，苏联建议签订朝鲜停战协定时，“波士顿先驱报”就曾于四月二十三日写道：“从各个方面，我们听到了这样的说法：真正的和平会使我们失去了立足点，会使美国陷入如此严重的危机，以致我们的制度将受到致命的危险……。我们经不起和平……。我们对危机所怀的恐惧是如此强烈，可以说：我们害怕它就如同害怕世界大战本身一样……。”
    像这样的说法已经在美国的报纸上经常出现了。美国资本主义已腐朽到如此程度，以致大资本家的代言人几乎是公开地在鼓吹新的世界战争，把它作为克服经济危机的手段。

    这些事实和数字说明，在美国，生产过剩的危机正在迫近。
    报纸和杂志以及资产阶级的经济学家和政论家的日益增多的不安论调充分说明：美国垄断资本家被即将到来的美国经济危机吓倒了。他们企图用加紧军备竞赛的办法来克服这种危机。
    但是这种办法从来也没有使资本主义国家逃过不可避免的危机。它也不会使美国逃得过。相反地，这种办法必然会使资本主义的矛盾更加尖锐，更加剧烈。
    〔注一〕美国把生产与商品流通的高涨时期称为“繁荣”。
    〔注二〕资产阶级经济学家和政论家害怕提到美国经济中的危机现象，因此采用了“经济衰退”这个术语，他们认为“经济衰退”仿佛是由于工业要“适应”市场需要而引起的。
