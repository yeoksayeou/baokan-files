International Students from Brotherly Countries at Peking University
    Determined to Master Chinese Language
    Mongolian Student Baendehu
    I came to Peking University to study in November 1952, and it has been a year now. When I shouldered the glorious task assigned to me by the people, the Party, and the government of my country and left my homeland, I didn't know a single Chinese character or a single Chinese sentence. After arriving in Beijing, Chinese friends treated me like family, introduced me to the situation in New China, and took us to visit cultural relics and the magnificent new buildings built by the Chinese working people. I saw the remarkable achievements of great China in all aspects, and I was eager to introduce them to the people of my country. Therefore, from then on, my desire to learn Chinese became even stronger.
    November 1st is a day of great significance in my life, and a day I will never forget. From that day on, I began to study Chinese with international students from brotherly countries: first learning pronunciation, then basic grammar. At that time, I encountered many difficulties. However, I did not bow my head in the face of difficulties, I had the confidence to overcome them. Thanks to the constant care and encouragement of Chinese teachers, the sincere help of Chinese classmates, and my own subjective efforts, my enthusiasm for learning Chinese became higher and higher, and I finally overcame many difficulties. By the end of the first semester, I could already speak simple Chinese and understood general Chinese grammar; by the end of the second semester, I had learned more than 3,000 words, mastered basic grammar, and could speak ordinary Chinese.
    This summer vacation, we traveled to various parts of China, visited cultural relics, and saw many new things, which greatly helped our studies. Now, I am in my final year of study.
    In the past year, although I have made considerable progress in learning Chinese, it is still not enough. For example, I still cannot freely converse with people in Chinese, and my pronunciation is not very accurate. I feel that in order to learn a foreign language, in addition to understanding its basic grammar and vocabulary, one must also master its characteristics and idioms. For example, I can talk to teachers, but if I talk to an ordinary person, I sometimes encounter many difficulties. My task is not only to learn the language of the great Chinese people, but also to learn the life and all the good qualities of the Chinese people, and introduce them to the people of my country.
    In China, I have seen many workers, farmers, cadres, and students, whether men, women, old or young, who are all dedicating their efforts to building their motherland and defending world peace under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese Communist Party. The brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in just four years have left a deep impression on me and inspired me to move forward. I am determined to work hard to complete the learning tasks assigned to me by the people of my country and to strive for a better future for mankind!
    First Harvest
    Polish Student Shi Duan
    In October of this year, I received a small book "A Big Tree by the Roadside" from the capital of my country, Warsaw. When I received this small book with a light green cover, translated from Chinese into Polish and sent from Poland to China, I was very happy. This is my first fruit of labor after learning Chinese—the first Chinese book I translated in the summer of 1952.
    Last summer vacation, I returned to Poland and showed the children's books I brought to my friends. After they listened to me tell the content of the books, some people immediately asked me: "Why don't you translate them? You have been learning Chinese for a year and a half, are you afraid to translate?" I was very worried at the time and lacked confidence. But my friends encouraged me and asked me to, so I started translating with a bold attempt. I didn't expect to see the fruits of my labor so quickly—the book was published.
    The publication of this book reminded me of the situation when I first arrived in China in January 1951. At that time, I couldn't even say "one," "two," or "three." Seeing the liberated China, everything made me marvel and admire, but I couldn't express my feelings to the Chinese people in Chinese.
    I also remembered the difficulties when I first learned Chinese. For these difficult-to-recognize and difficult-to-write square Chinese characters, I sometimes really had no confidence. I thought, I would never be able to learn it in my life. But, slowly, this idea disappeared, and I became more and more interested in Chinese, although I had made some jokes in my studies. For example, saying "many people went into the room" as "many people crawled into the room." Another time, one of our Polish classmates went into the wrong room, and he wanted to say, "Sorry," but he said, "It doesn't matter." These mistakes made us feel sad at the time.
    In the process of learning, we met some Chinese friends. From them, I more clearly recognized China and understood China. I also deeply realized that learning Chinese is not just a matter of my personal interest, because I know that in that distant Poland, many people want to know everything about China on the other side of the earth.
    A Polish farmer once wrote to his son studying in China, asking with concern about the situation of Chinese farmers. From such a small matter, I especially felt the importance of my responsibility. In the future, we should be bridges connecting the cultures of China and Poland.
    Our Learning Wishes Have Been Realized
    East German Students Bai Dingyuan
    Lan Yanni
    Both of us are children of workers, and since childhood we had to help our families with work to earn bread. After the liberation of East Germany, the government set up worker-peasant supplementary schools for us, and the doors of specialized schools were also opened to the working people.
    In the past, we knew very little about China. After entering the worker-peasant supplementary school, we learned about the country of the great Mao Zedong and recognized the heroic Chinese people. From then on, we began to enthusiastically browse books about this great country with thousands of years of ancient culture. In Berlin, we visited the Chinese art exhibition, and we asked those young men and women who came from China to participate in the Third World Youth and Students Peace Festival about the situation in China. Every new achievement of New China made us very excited. A wish arose in our hearts: to go to New China. After studying Chinese culture and history in East Germany, the government sent us to China to study. Comrades will understand how happy we are!
    We started learning Chinese on May 18th this year. From the first day, we established a deep friendship with Chinese teachers and classmates. Learning Chinese is difficult for us. But because of the efforts made by the teachers and the enthusiastic help of the classmates, the difficulties we encountered in learning were reduced.
    Our learning environment is very good. We can watch movies every week, and we often go to the theater. These have helped us to further understand the life of the Chinese people. We have good sports fields. Doctors take care of our health.
    This summer vacation, we took a trip to southern China. We visited the beautiful scenic spots in Hangzhou, visited Shanghai, and visited the former residence of Lu Xun. During the trip, we also visited many factories. Everywhere is the same scene: the arrow on the work target chart is always rising! Everywhere there are new buildings and new houses. Worker dormitories are being built from the ground up. When we visited a new workers' residential area in Shanghai, the residents happily told us about their new life.
    We are really happy to be able to live with the Chinese people. Although learning Chinese is not an easy task, the enthusiasm of Chinese friends inspires us. In the future, we will introduce the past suffering of the Chinese people, the heroic struggle of the Chinese people, and their current happy life to the people of our country, especially the German youth.
    I Thank Chinese Teachers and Friends
    Bulgarian Student Ji Lianchuo
    I am a student from Dimitrov's homeland—Bulgaria—and I am now studying at Peking University. Three years ago, I was a person who didn't understand a single Chinese character, couldn't sing a single Chinese song, couldn't dance a single Chinese dance, and didn't know how to eat with chopsticks, and was not familiar with Chinese culture and revolutionary history. Therefore, after I came to China, I encountered many difficulties in my studies, but with the help of Chinese teachers and classmates, these difficulties were gradually overcome.
    I have visited many cities, factories, and villages in China, and met many labor models. They told me about the difficult life of the working people in old China and the happy life now. They love their great leader Chairman Mao, they also love the socialist Soviet Union, and they actively participate in the struggle to defend world peace.
    I have an old Chinese friend named Zhao Guoxing (transliteration), who used to be a poor peasant in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. He told me that 72 of the 101 poor peasant households in their village have now become middle peasants. He invited me to visit the village's production cooperative, nursery, and newly built school. I saw with my own eyes the working people of New China who had been liberated from the shackles of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, and I also saw the vigorous development of New China's agriculture, industry, and culture. Here, there are newly built factories, schools, and new-style residences everywhere. Everything new that I saw and heard from my Chinese friends is engraved in my heart, and I feel extremely honored to study in New China.
    Now, I can speak ordinary Chinese, write general letters and articles in Chinese; I can sing a few Chinese songs and dance the Yangko dance; I have some understanding of Chinese culture, especially Chinese revolutionary history; I am familiar with the life habits and character of the Chinese people, and I am accustomed to the life of the Chinese people. I have also made many good friends, including Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, workers, farmers, and university students, as well as Young Pioneers wearing red scarves. They used to help me, and they are still helping me to practice correct pronunciation and write Chinese characters, and learn about the heroic struggles of the Chinese people.
    For everything I have learned here, I thank my Chinese teachers and friends.

    兄弟国家的留学生在北京大学
    决心学好中国语文
    蒙古留学生　巴恩德呼
    一九五二年十一月我到北京大学学习，到今天已经一年了。当我肩负起我国人民、党和政府交给我的光荣任务，离开祖国的时候，我连一个中国字也不认识，一句中国话也不会说。到北京以后，中国友人像一家人似的对待我，给我介绍新中国的情况，带我们去参观文物古迹和中国劳动人民新建的巨大建筑物。我看到了伟大中国在各方面的卓越成就，就急于要把它们介绍给祖国人民。因此，从那时起，我要学好中国语文的愿望更强烈了。
    十一月一日是我生命史中具有重大意义的日子，也是我永远不会忘记的日子。从那天起，我和兄弟国家的留学生们在一起，开始学习中国语文：先学发音，后学基本语法。当时，我碰到了不少困难。但是，我在困难面前并未低头，我有信心克服困难。由于中国教师的经常关怀和鼓舞，中国同学的真诚帮助，以及自己的主观努力，学习中文的热情愈来愈高，终于克服了很多困难。第一学期结束时，我已经能说简单的中国话，也懂得了一般的中国语法；第二学期结束时，我已经学会了三千多个单字，掌握了基本语法，并且可以说普通的中国话了。
    今年暑假，我们到中国各处去旅行，参观了文化古迹，看到了许多的新鲜事物，这对我们的学习有很大帮助。现在，我正进行着最后一学年的学习。
    一年来，我虽然在中国语文学习上得到了不少成绩，但还是不够的。比如，现在我还不能自由地用中国话和人交谈，发音也不十分准确。我觉得，学外国语言除必须懂得它的基本语法和词汇外，还应当掌握它的特点和习惯用法。譬如，我可以和教师谈话，但如果和一个普通的人谈话，有时就会遇到很多困难。我的任务不仅是学好伟大中国人民的语言，而且还要学习中国人民的生活和一切优点，并把它们介绍给祖国人民。
    我在中国见到了许多的工人、农民、干部和学生，他们无论男女老幼都在中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，为建设祖国，保卫世界和平而献出自己的力量。中国人民在短短的四年内取得的辉煌成就，留给我深刻的印象，鼓舞着我前进。我决心努力完成祖国人民交给我的学习任务，为人类美好的未来而奋斗！
    第一次收获
    波兰留学生　石　端
    今年十月，我接到了由祖国的首都——华沙寄来的一本小书“路边的一棵大树”。当我拿到了这本淡绿色封皮的、由中文译成波兰文，又由波兰寄到中国来的小书时，心里非常喜悦。这是我学习中文后的第一个劳动果实——一九五二年夏天翻译的第一本中文书。
    去年暑假，我曾经回到波兰，并且把我带去的儿童读物拿给朋友们看。当他们听我讲了书的内容以后，有人马上追问我：“为什么不把它们翻译出来？你已经学了一年半中文，还不敢翻译吗？”我当时很耽心，缺乏信心。但是朋友们鼓舞我，要求我，因此我就怀着大胆尝试的心情开始翻译工作了。却没想到这样快就看见了自己劳动的收获——书出版了。
    这本书的出版，使我想起了一九五一年一月刚到中国时的情形。那时，我连“一”、“二”、“三”都不会念。看见解放了的中国，什么都使我惊羡赞叹，但是自己却不能用中国话向中国人民表达自己的感情。
    我又想起了刚学中文时的困难。对于这难认难写的方块汉字，有时自己真是没有信心。我想过，我这一辈子是学不会它的。可是，慢慢地这种想法就没有了，对于中文我越来越感到兴趣，虽然我在学习中曾发生过一些笑话。例如，把“许多人进到屋子里”说成“许多人钻到屋子里”。还有一次，我们的一个波兰同学走错了屋子，他心里想说：“对不起”，但是他却说了“没关系”。这些错误在当时曾使我们感到难过。
    在学习的过程中，我们认识了一些中国朋友。由他们那里我更清楚地认识了中国，了解了中国。我也深刻地体会到，学习中文绝不光是我个人的兴趣问题，因为我知道，在那遥远的波兰，有多少人想知道在地球的另一端的中国的一切情况。
    一个波兰农民，曾写信给在中国留学的儿子，关切地问到关于中国农民的事情。由这样一件小事，我特别感到自己责任的重大。将来我们应该是沟通中波两国文化的桥梁。
    我俩的学习愿望实现了
    民主德国留学生　白定远
    蓝燕妮
    我们夫妇俩都是工人的孩子，从小时候起就得帮助家庭做工来赚面包吃。东德解放后，政府为我们设立了工农补习学校，专科学校的大门也为劳动人民打开了。
    以前，关于中国我们知道得很少。进了工农补习学校，我们才了解了伟大的毛泽东的国家，认识了英勇的中国人民。从那时起，我们开始热心地翻阅关于这个拥有几千年古老文化的伟大国家的书籍。在柏林我们参观过中国艺术展览会，我们跟那些从中国来参加第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的青年男女们打听中国的情形，新中国的每一个新的成就，都使我们非常兴奋。我们的心里产生了一个愿望：到新中国去。在民主德国学习了有关中国的文化知识和历史，政府就送我们到中国来学习。同志们会了解，我们是多么幸福啊！
    我们从今年五月十八日开始学习中文。从第一天起，我们就和中国教师和同学们建立起深厚的友谊。学习中国语文，对我们来说是困难的。但由于教师们对我们所作的努力，同学们对我们热情的帮助，减少了我们在学习上所遇到的困难。
    我们的学习环境非常好。每周我们可以看电影，也常常去看戏。这些都使我们进一步了解了中国人民的生活。我们有很好的运动场。医生照顾着我们的健康。
    今年暑假，我们到中国南方去作了一次旅行。我们参观了杭州美丽的风景区，游览了上海，访问了鲁迅的故居。在旅行中我们还参观了很多工厂。到处是同一景象：工作指标表上的箭头永远在上升！到处都是新建筑和新住宅。工人宿舍一幢幢地从平地上建立起来。当我们在上海访问一个新的工人住宅区时，那里的居民幸福地对我们谈了他们的新生活。
    我们真高兴，能跟中国人民生活在一起。虽然学中文不是一件容易的事，但是中国朋友们的学习热情鼓舞了我们。我们将来要把中国人民过去的苦难，中国人民的英勇斗争和他们现在的幸福生活介绍给我们祖国的人民，特别是德国的青年们。
    我感谢中国教师和朋友
    保加利亚留学生　季连绰
    我是一个从季米特洛夫的祖国——保加利亚来的学生，现在在北京大学念书。三年前我是连一个中国字也不懂、一个中国歌也不会唱、一个中国舞也不会跳的人，我也不懂得用筷子吃饭，不熟悉中国的文化和革命历史，因此，我到中国以后，在学习中碰到了许多困难，但是在中国教师和同学的帮助下这些困难慢慢也就克服了。
    我在中国参观了许多城市、工厂和乡村，碰见了许多劳动模范，他们告诉我旧中国劳动人民的困苦生活和现在的幸福生活。他们热爱着自己的伟大领袖毛主席，他们也热爱着社会主义的苏联，他们积极地参加了保卫世界和平的斗争。
    我有一位中国老朋友叫赵国兴（译音），他从前是北京东郊的贫农。他告诉我，他们村里一百零一户贫农现在有七十二户已经成了中农。他请我参观了村里的生产合作社、托儿所和新建的学校。我亲眼看见了从半封建半殖民地枷锁下解放出来的新中国劳动人民，也看到了新中国农业、工业和文化事业蓬勃发展的情况。在这里，到处都是新建的工厂、学校、新式住宅。我看到的和从中国朋友那里听到的一切新鲜事物，都铭记在我的心里，我感到在新中国学习是万分荣幸的。
    现在，我已经能够说普通的中国话，用中文写一般的信件和文章；能够唱几首中国歌和跳秧歌舞；对中国的文化特别是中国的革命历史有了一些认识；我熟悉了中国人民的生活习惯和性格，习惯了中国人民的生活。我还认识了很多好朋友，其中有在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军战士，有工人、农民和大学生，还有围着红领巾的少年先锋队队员。他们从前曾帮助过我，现在还在帮助我练习正确的发音和写中国字，学习关于中国人民英勇斗争的事迹。
    为了我在这里所学到的一切，我感谢我的中国教师和朋友。（附图片）
