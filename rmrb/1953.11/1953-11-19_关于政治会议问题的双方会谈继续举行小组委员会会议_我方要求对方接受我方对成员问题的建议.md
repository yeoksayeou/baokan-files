[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th] The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

    On November 18th, subcommittee meetings on the issue of the political conference continued.

    In the subcommittee discussing membership and location issues, Mr. Ki Sok-bok, representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stated in his speech: The composition of the Korean political conference based on our plan proposed on November 17th regarding the membership issue, should be the participating countries from both sides and five neutral nations. This plan affirms the clear responsibilities of the relevant countries on both sides in the political conference, while also allowing the relevant neutral countries to play a positive role in the political conference. Our plan is completely reasonable, and the other side has no reason to oppose it. As for the two so-called suggestions put forward by the other side yesterday, arguing that neutral countries can only be "considered" to participate after the Korean issue has already been resolved in the political conference, or after the political conference has undergone a so-called "reasonable time" of substantive discussion. This not only deprives the relevant neutral countries of the right to participate in the political conference and jointly seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, but also negates the positive role they can play in the political conference. Therefore, the so-called suggestions put forward by the other side essentially still fundamentally refuse the participation of neutral countries in the political conference. Mr. Ki Sok-bok concluded by saying: Our side resolutely rejects the two suggestions put forward by the other side yesterday, and demands that the other side consider and accept our suggestions regarding the membership issue.

    In order to confuse the public, the U.S. representative Dean deliberately raised a number of fundamentally irrelevant questions regarding our suggestions on the membership issue, demanding that our side answer them. Our side immediately pointed out: Our suggestions are already very clear and unambiguous, but in order to clarify the other side's questions, our side can make some necessary explanations tomorrow.

    In the subcommittee discussing the time issue, our side further suggested that the date of the political conference be tentatively set as the first day four weeks after the date on which agreement is reached on the first agenda item, and requested the other side to consider and accept this.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈继续举行小组委员会会议
    我方要求对方接受我方对成员问题的建议
   【新华社开城十八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月十八日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈继续举行小组委员会会议。
    在讨论成员与地点问题的小组委员会中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生在发言中指出：根据我方十一月十七日所提关于政治会议成员问题的方案组成朝鲜政治会议的成员，应为双方参加的国家和五个中立国家，这个方案肯定了双方有关国家在政治会议中的明确责任，同时又能发挥有关中立国家在政治会议中的积极作用。我方方案是完全合理的，对方没有任何理由加以反对。至于对方昨日提出的两点所谓建议，主张中立国家只能在朝鲜问题已经在政治会议中被解决之后，或在政治会议已经过了所谓“合理时间”的实质讨论之后才能被“考虑”参加。这不仅剥夺了有关中立国家参加政治会议与双方共同寻求和平解决朝鲜问题的权利，而且抹煞了它们在政治会议中所能起的积极作用。因此，对方所提出的所谓建议，实质上仍然是根本拒绝中立国参加政治会议。奇石福先生最后表示：我方断然拒绝对方昨日提出的两点建议，并要求对方考虑与接受我方关于成员问题的建议。
    美方代表迪安为了混淆视听，故意对我方关于成员问题的建议提出若干根本不成为问题的问题，要求我方答复。我方当即指出：我方建议本已十分清楚明确，但为了澄清对方的问题，我方可在明天作一些必要的说明。
    在讨论时间问题的小组委员会中，我方进一步建议初步确定第一项议程获得协议之日四星期后的第一天为政治会议召开的日期，要求对方考虑并接受。
