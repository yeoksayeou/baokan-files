　　As the country enters a period of planned economic construction, it is even more significant than in the past for state organ personnel to actively improve work efficiency and do the work entrusted to them by the people well. Therefore, during this year's National Day, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference issued a slogan celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of New China, calling on state organ personnel to "improve their theoretical and policy level and professional level, abide by national discipline and work systems, work actively, and constantly improve work efficiency…". Today's article by Shen Yunfen, "I Love the Work the Party Assigned Me," published in this newspaper, specifically illustrates that any staff member in any state organ, as long as they love their work, learn modestly, and study diligently, can improve work efficiency and quality, and create new records!
　　The main reason why young Comrade Shen Yunfen was able to rapidly improve her typing efficiency and create new records is that she loves the work assigned to her by the Party. Revolutionary work is like a large machine, and any part or component of the machine is indispensable. Typing work is also an indispensable part of modern state organ work. Comrade Shen Yunfen has the noble qualities of obeying the organization's decisions and obeying the needs of the motherland and the people; she has a high degree of enthusiasm for revolutionary work; on this basis, when she specifically did the typing work assigned to her by the Party, and more clearly understood the significance of this work in the work process, she loved her work even more!
　　Shen Yunfen's love for her work is not only reflected in her ability to work steadily, but also in her ability to learn step by step and honestly from the very beginning of her work. She is humble and eager to learn. She can absorb the mature experience of advanced workers up to the specific skills of each comrade, and apply them to her own work, so her work efficiency has improved rapidly. However, Shen Yunfen was not proud or complacent; under the cultivation and education of the Party, she bravely struggled against the thoughts and styles that hindered her work progress, thus reducing errors in typing and ensuring the quality of her work. At a time when the country is entering planned economic construction, and at a time when the whole country is investing in the high tide of the increase production and practice economy movement, Shen Yunfen's work spirit is worthy of our state organ staff to learn from!

    不断提高工作效率
    当国家进入有计划的经济建设时期，国家机关工作人员积极地提高工作效率，做好人民委托给自己的工作，较已往具有更重大的意义。因此今年国庆时，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会发布的庆祝新中国成立四周年的口号中，号召国家机关工作人员“提高自己的理论政策水平和业务水平，遵守国家纪律和工作制度，积极工作，不断地提高工作效率……”。今天本报发表的沈蕴芬的“我热爱党分配给我的工作”一文，恰恰具体地说明：国家任何机关的任何工作人员，只要热爱自己的工作，虚心学习，苦心钻研就能提高工作的效率和质量，并且创造出新纪录来！
    年青的沈蕴芬同志所以能够迅速地提高打字效率，并且创造出新纪录来，主要原因是她热爱党分配给她的工作。革命工作就像一部大机器，机器的任何一部分、任何一个零件都是不可缺少的。打字工作也正是现代国家机关工作中不可少的一部分。沈蕴芬同志具有服从组织决定、服从祖国和人民需要的高贵品质，她对待革命工作有着高度的热情；在这个基础上，当她具体做了党所分配给她的打字工作，在工作过程中更明确地理解了这种工作的意义之后，她就更加热爱自己的工作了！
    沈蕴芬热爱工作，不仅表现在能够一贯地安心工作，而且表现在她一开始工作，就能够按步就班地学习，老老实实地学习。她虚怀若谷，苦学苦练。她能够吸取先进工作者成熟的经验直到每一个同志的某一技之长，运用到自己工作中去，因而她的工作效率迅速地提高了。但是沈蕴芬并没有骄傲，也不自满；在党的培养和教育下，她勇敢地向自己的妨碍工作进步的思想和作风进行了斗争，因而减少了打字中的错误，保证了自己工作的质量。在国家进入计划经济建设的时候，在全国都投入高涨的增产节约运动中的时候，沈蕴芬的工作精神，是值得我们国家机关工作人员学习的！
