    One. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and thanks to the efforts of all employees, the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, and the promotion of advanced experiences from the China Changchun Railway, the national railways have completed democratic reforms, carried out some production reforms through a series of political movements, thereby raising the political awareness of the vast number of employees, producing a group of model workers and advanced workers, training a group of cadres, improving railway transport efficiency, and completing the transportation tasks in support of the Liberation War and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the national economic recovery phase. Employees' lives have been improved accordingly on the basis of production development. Specifically, after liberation, not only were 9,991 kilometers of lines repaired and the main trunk lines of the country reinforced, but also 1,473 kilometers of new railways were built (including 153 kilometers of the Baoji-Tianshui Line), increasing the total operational mileage to 24,232 kilometers by the end of 1952. Due to the recovery and development of the national economy, the volume of passenger and freight transportation on railways has also increased year by year. If we take 1950 as 100, the number of tons of goods dispatched in 1951 was 110.9, in 1952 it was 132.2, and in the first nine months of this year, 114.9 percent of the 1950 figure has been completed; the number of passengers in 1951 was 102.3, in 1952 it was 104.4, and in the first nine months of this year, 106 percent of the 1950 figure has been completed. The efficiency of vehicle utilization has also been continuously improved. The turnaround time of freight cars, if we take 1950 as 100, was 103.7 in 1951, 115.2 in 1952, and 108 in the first eight months of this year. Transportation costs have decreased year by year, from 89 percent of 1950 in 1951 to 86 percent in 1952. The budget for the first half of this year is 90.3 percent. If calculated based on comparable costs, the first half of this year is still 17.7 percent lower than in 1952. Labor productivity has increased year by year, from 124.7 percent of 1950 in 1951 to 138.5 percent in 1952. The first half of this year has already completed 91.1 percent of the total for 1950. Due to the increase in transportation volume, the reduction in costs, and the continuous improvement in labor productivity, the profits turned over by the railways have also increased year by year, from 204 percent of 1950 in 1951 to 295 percent in 1952. The budgeted profit for the first half of this year has already reached 160 percent of the 1950 figure. In the process of completing transportation tasks over the past four years, many advanced working methods have emerged, such as the Li Xikui shunting method, the Zheng Xikun locomotive operation method, the Yang Maolin loading method, the new vehicle pre-departure inspection method, and the Guo Chunlin new track maintenance method, which have improved production efficiency. On the basis of production development, the material and cultural lives of employees have also improved. Wages have increased, and since the implementation of labor insurance for railway employees nationwide, 620,000 employees and 1,870,000 family members have directly enjoyed labor insurance benefits. By the end of 1952, a total of 50,000 illiterate people had been eliminated across the railway system. Since 1952, a rapid literacy method has been promoted throughout the system, with 147,000 people currently participating, and more than 21,000 people participating in long-term cultural learning.

    Two.
    Railway work has been successful, but the errors and shortcomings that exist are also serious, mainly manifested in:

    First, planning and management are still poor, and transportation production is unbalanced. Since 1950, the national railways have had their first annual plan. However, because our understanding that railway transportation serves production, and that railways must formulate transportation plans according to the needs of national economic development, is not clear enough, we have not conducted systematic research on the proportions of national economic development and the situation of cargo sources and cargo flows, resulting in plans that are too high or too low, and difficult to grasp. In 1952, due to the plan being too high, errors were made in soliciting freight in order to complete the task; and in 1953, due to insufficient estimation of the national economic development situation, the plan was too low, with conservative shortcomings. Due to the lack of information on cargo sources and cargo flows, the train operation diagram is divorced from reality, causing disorder in the train operation. In addition, the planning and organization of transportation dispatch work are not strong enough, and phenomena such as having cars but no goods, having goods but no cars, and mismatch between car types and cargo types often occur, resulting in a waste of transportation capacity. In terms of passenger transportation, there are not enough passenger cars to meet the needs of passengers, and the poor ticket sales methods and insufficient service work further increase the difficulties for passengers. Again, because we have not fully verified the railway equipment capacity and various consumption quotas, we are not clear about the situation, so the investment in basic construction has a certain degree of blindness.

    Second, indicators are advanced rashly, quality is not high, and accidents are numerous. In recent years, due to the promotion and help of advanced Soviet experiences and the high enthusiasm of employees, quotas have been continuously broken, which is a very good phenomenon. However, because our analysis and research on new records are insufficient, and our understanding of the average advanced quota is insufficient, we lack a realistic approach to formulating indicators; we blindly demand improvement, are satisfied with quantity, and do not pay attention to quality; as a result, lower-level personnel rush to complete tasks and rush to meet indicators, do not comply with rules and regulations, do not comply with labor discipline, and accidents have not been eliminated for a long time and have even increased. Therefore, starting from this summer's fixed-point work, we have consciously lowered some indicators in order to reverse the trend of rash advance and grasp the principle of steady progress. For example, the turnaround time of freight cars has been reduced from 2.9 days in 1952 to 3.09 days.

    Third, the management system is not sound, and labor organization is unreasonable in many places. Although the economic accounting system has been implemented in the national railways and its main grassroots units, due to insufficient understanding of this socialist method of operating and managing enterprises and insufficient ideological preparation, the idea that "completing tasks does not count" still exists seriously in many units. In terms of labor organization, the three-and-a-half shift system and the three-shift, two-and-a-half shift, and two-shift intermittent system have not been universally implemented. In many places, the three-shift and two-shift rotation systems are still used, and employees work for too long continuously, which affects work efficiency and employees' health. In addition, due to unclear division of labor, some units have surplus manpower, while others do not have enough manpower allocated. Even in the same unit, due to unbalanced production, sometimes there are too many people, and sometimes overtime work is required to complete tasks. Due to the lack of job descriptions and unclear responsibilities, the responsibility system cannot be well implemented.

    Fourth, in terms of basic construction, the plan was not established on a reliable basis, and subjective forces were overestimated, resulting in an overly large new construction project plan. In terms of the system, although we have implemented the new system of division of labor and mutual restraint among the three departments of basic construction, design, and construction, and have initially transformed the military rush repair method and the supply system, there are still many shortcomings: the design force is weak, the design quality is poor, and it cannot keep up with the needs of construction; in the construction department, planning and management are poor, construction preparation is insufficient, site management is chaotic, the construction progress is unbalanced, the construction quality is not good, the cost is high, and there is a lot of waste. In terms of the guiding ideology of basic construction, there is a tendency to be greedy and rash, with too many frameworks opened up, too many stalls set up, and forces dispersed in the absence of engineering and technical personnel, weak design forces, insufficient management cadres, and especially little or no practical experience in planned economic construction, which has prevented the concentrated use of national investment and delayed key construction projects.

    Fifth, insufficient attention is paid to the training of cadres. Since liberation, various forms have been used to improve the political, technical, and professional level of employees. By the end of 1952, a total of 212,943 employees had participated in full-time and part-time study, and 16,493 leading cadres at the section chief and director level or above had been trained and promoted. However, since the increase in new line engineering institutions and the allocation of personnel to new line projects last year, there has been a severe shortage of cadres. This situation proves that we have lacked overall consideration of the cadre issue in recent years, there is no systematic training plan, and we are not bold enough in promoting cadres, so the growth of cadres cannot meet the needs of work development.

    The occurrence of these errors and shortcomings is mainly due to the fact that the leadership of the Ministry of Railways has a low level of ideological and political understanding, there are problems of subjectivism, decentralism, and bureaucracy, they are satisfied with the achievements they have made, there are many work arrangements but few inspections, they do not understand the situation on the ground, and they lack a pragmatic work style, so that many of the shortcomings and errors that have been discovered cannot be corrected in a timely manner.

    Three.
    With the start of the country's first five-year construction plan, railway transportation tasks have become more arduous. The number of tons of goods dispatched approved by the state in 1953 increased by 6.2 percent compared to 1952, the freight turnover increased by 6.5 percent compared to 1952, the number of passengers increased by 6 percent compared to 1952, the freight car turnaround time was shortened by 0.02 days, and the new line investment was 237 percent of 1952. If we take 1952 as 100, the main project quantities in 1953 are 206 percent for earthwork, 237 percent for tunnels, 319 percent for large and medium-sized bridges, and 608 kilometers for track laying, which is 126 percent of last year.

    Due to insufficient estimation of national economic development and lack of foresight, this year's transportation plan is too low. From January to September of this year, the number of tons dispatched has completed 81.8 percent of the annual plan. Among them: coal and coke 69.3 percent, steel and products 80.4 percent, mineral building materials 127 percent, wood 77.5 percent, grain 73.4 percent. The number of passengers has completed 95.7 percent of the annual plan. The freight car turnover rate was completed in 3.09 days, which is 0.21 days longer than planned. From January to August, the freight turnover has completed 76.2 percent of the annual plan. Passenger kilometers have completed 87.5 percent of the annual plan, and the transportation cost in the first half of the year has been reduced by 23 percent compared to the plan, labor productivity has increased by 22 percent, and the profits turned over have completed 100 percent of the annual plan.

    In terms of the basic construction plan, due to overestimating subjective forces, the plan is again too high. Only 15 percent of the annual plan was completed in the first half of this year. After stepping up construction in the third quarter, the new railways have completed 65 percent of the annual plan by the end of September, with 459 kilometers of mainline track laid. Among them, the Lanzhou to Yongdeng section in the Northwest, with a length of 103 kilometers, and the Chengdu to Mianyang section in the Southwest, with a length of 118 kilometers, both held opening ceremonies on National Day this year. However, it is still very necessary to tighten up some projects that cannot be completed and unnecessary items based on the principle of combining needs and possibilities.

    Based on the above situation, responding to the state's call to "increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, reduce expenditures, and overfulfill the state plan," we have decided to increase production and save 31,000 billion yuan and reduce investment by 10,000 billion yuan, totaling 41,000 billion yuan. According to the situation of completing transportation production tasks in the past nine months of this year and the current state's call to increase production and vigorously organize material exchanges, it is possible to complete and even overfulfill the task.

    Due to the increasing volume of passenger and freight transportation, there has been a shortage of passenger and freight vehicles and insufficient capacity in some sections. This contradiction will inevitably become more acute with the further development of the national economy, and its development will seriously hinder the progress of national economic construction. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the leadership of the party, fully mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of employees, tapping potential, finding solutions, and giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and making the greatest possible use of existing equipment, we must thoroughly verify the capacity of lines and various transportation equipment, identify weak links and strengthen overhaul work, and provide necessary investment to overcome difficulties and improve work in order to ensure smooth completion.

    Four.
    According to the general policy of the state's five-year construction plan, the fundamental task given to national railway work by the state is to complete the state's transportation tasks, serve the country's industrialization and the modernization of national defense, and maximize the satisfaction of the growing demands of national economic construction, national defense construction, and people's production and life for railway transportation. To this end, we must attach great importance to strengthening new line construction in order to cooperate with the establishment of new industrial bases and national defense bases; and further tap the potential of existing railways, improve transportation capacity, and reduce costs to accumulate more funds for national construction. According to the policy of "increasing production, practicing strict economy, focusing on key construction, and making steady progress," new lines should be built gradually and with a focus on a reliable basis, and the management and operation of operating railways should be resolutely improved, the remnants of the old corrupt management and operation methods should be thoroughly changed, and the thinking and system of socialist management and operation should be established and strengthened. For this purpose, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "learn from the Soviet Union," earnestly learn and promote the advanced experiences of the China Changchun Railway, and require all roads in the country to gradually reach the level of the China Changchun Railway within a certain period of time. This is the basic direction of national railway work for a certain period of time in the future.

    To this end, we must earnestly do the following key tasks:

    First, organize the study of the original China Changchun Railway experience, review and revise rules and regulations. First of all, unify and correct the thinking of learning from the advanced experience of the China Changchun Railway within the entire railway system, and recognize that the China Changchun Railway experience is a model of the combination of advanced Soviet experience and the specific situation of Chinese railways. If we can systematically learn and promote the advanced experience of the China Changchun Railway, we can avoid many detours in operating and managing railways, rapidly improve the level of railway operation and management, and accelerate the progress of railway construction. In terms of the requirements for learning, the department and bureau levels are required to learn and understand the complete set of basic knowledge of socialist operation and management of the China Changchun Railway, as well as the methods and steps for implementation. The station, section, and factory levels should learn the professional experience of the same nature as the China Changchun Railway based on the principle of learning what they do. And in conjunction with learning from the China Changchun Railway experience, obtain the help of Soviet experts, and revise the existing rules and regulations according to the specific situation of our country's railways. Each bureau should also formulate steps according to the specific situation and gradually promote them by adopting the method of learning and doing at the same time. The quality of learning and promoting the advanced experience of the China Changchun Railway is the key to determining whether our people's railways can continue to improve. Therefore, we must conduct periodic inspections and summaries, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and correct deviations.

    Second, strengthen planning management and develop a work style of strictly abiding by planning discipline. Normally and systematically study the situation of cargo sources and cargo flows in order to formulate practical and feasible transportation plans, and do a good job of original records and quota work to strengthen the foundation of planning management. And do a good job of operation plans, transportation dispatch, work dispatch, and production dispatch work, formulate daily shift plans and train formation plans according to the transportation plan, improve various technical operation processes, strengthen the planning and discipline of dispatch work, strictly allocate locomotives and vehicles according to the transportation plan and formation plan, strictly drive trains according to the train operation diagram, resolutely overcome localism and the disorganized and undisciplined phenomenon of not seriously implementing dispatch orders, pay close attention to verifying and calculating the existing equipment capacity of the railway as the basis for compiling the basic construction plan. At the same time, strengthen the financial supervision system to ensure the implementation of the plan.

    Third, rationally adjust the labor organization, establish a responsibility system, strengthen labor discipline, and resolutely and gradually reform the unreasonable three-shift and two-shift rotation systems. Implement the three-and-a-half shift rotation system or the three-shift, two-shift intermittent system according to the specific situation, merge overlapping institutions, handle surplus personnel, formulate job descriptions, clarify the scope of responsibilities to overcome the phenomenon of uneven work and no one being responsible, and vigorously correct the phenomenon of lax labor discipline, non-compliance with operating procedures, and technical regulations, and illegal and undisciplined behavior in order to gradually reduce traffic accidents.

    Fourth, in terms of basic construction, strictly review past plans based on the principle of combining needs and possibilities, resolutely not do what can be done or not done, postpone what can be postponed, and resolutely reduce unnecessary projects and work that cannot be carried out at present to ensure the timely completion of key projects. Replenish the design force, pay close attention to the collection and research of design materials, reduce and gradually eliminate design rework, improve design quality, establish overall design thinking, promote the design responsibility system, widely adopt standardized design, and formulate practical and feasible budget quotas to prepare design budgets. In terms of construction, strictly follow the design to improve quality as the main focus, and on this basis, shorten the construction period and reduce construction costs to achieve the overall requirements of "good, fast, and economical." To this end, it is planned to vigorously strengthen the planning management of new projects and gradually implement the economic accounting system, train new project cadres, accumulate experience, and lay the foundation for future construction.

    Fifth, vigorously train cadres, formulate long-term plans for training cadres according to the needs of railway development, open various professional training classes in a planned and systematic way, advocate and effectively help the apprentice training method to improve the professional and technical level of in-service cadres and workers. Add deputy positions on site to train complete sets of cadres. Strengthen the leadership of railway colleges and secondary technical schools and technical schools. Pay attention to training and boldly promote worker cadres, and steadily improve the quality of cadres to meet the needs of national economic construction.

    Five.
    In order to ensure the completion of the above-mentioned guidelines and tasks, we must strengthen ideological and political work in railway work, overcome the ideas of pride, complacency, and blind advance among cadres, so as to ensure the implementation of the guideline of learning from and promoting the advanced experience of the China Changchun Railway. Secondly, establish among cadres at all levels and all employees the concept of serving national economic construction, especially industrial construction, and specifically serving cargo owners. Take the initiative to help cargo owners, contact cargo owners, and take care of the specific difficulties of cargo owners. And formulate railway transportation regulations to legally clarify the relationship between railways and cargo owners. Again, continue to conduct in-depth patriotic education, organize labor competitions, consolidate labor discipline, and constantly inspire the labor enthusiasm and creativity of employees. Finally, in conjunction with the current work, continue to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, overcome the subjectivism, decentralism, and bureaucracy of leading organs and leading cadres, and the "five excesses" phenomenon of grassroots units. If we do the above work well and improve our ideological and political level, we firmly believe that we are fully confident of completing the tasks assigned by the state.

    关于铁路工作情况及今后工作部署的报告
    （一九五三年十月二十九日中央人民政府铁道部滕代远部长在政务院第一百九十一次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    一四年来，全国铁路在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，由于全体职工的努力，苏联专家的热心帮助和中长路先进经验的推广，并通过了一系列的政治运动，完成了民主改革，进行了若干生产改革工作，从而提高了广大职工的政治觉悟，涌现出一批劳动模范和先进工作者，培养了一批干部，提高了铁路运输效率，完成了支援解放战争，抗美援朝的斗争和国家经济恢复阶段的运输任务。并在生产发展的基础上相应地改善了职工生活。具体表现在：解放后不仅修复了九千九百九十一公里线路，补强了全国主要干线，而且新建了铁路一千四百七十三公里（包括宝天线一五三公里），使一九五二年底全国通车里程增加为二四、二三二公里。由于国民经济的恢复与发展，铁路客、货运量也逐年增长，如以一九五○年为一○○，则货物发送吨数一九五一年为一一○·九，一九五二年为一三二·二，本年一至九月已完成一九五○年的百分之一一四·九；旅客人数，一九五一年为一○二·三，一九五二年为一○四·四，本年一至九月已完成一九五○年的百分之一○六。在车辆运用效率方面也不断进步，货车周转时间，如以一九五○年为一○○，则一九五一年为一○三·七，一九五二年为一一五·二，本年一至八月为一○八。运输成本逐年下降，一九五一年为一九五○年的百分之八九，而一九五二年又降为百分之八六，本年上半年决算为百分之九○·三，如按可比成本计算则本年上半年尚较一九五二年降低百分之一七·七。劳动生产率则逐年提高，一九五一年为一九五○年的百分之一二四·七，一九五二年又增为一三八·五，本年上半年已完成一九五○年全年的百分之九一·一。由于运量增加，成本降低和劳动生产率的不断提高，使铁路上缴利润也逐年增长，一九五一年为一九五○年的百分之二○四，一九五二年又增加为百分之二九五，本年上半年决算利润已为一九五○年的百分之一六○。四年来在完成运输任务过程中出现了很多先进的工作方法，如李锡奎调车法，郑锡坤机车操纵法，杨茂林装车法，车辆新列检法，郭春林新养路法等，提高了生产效率。在生产发展的基础上，职工的物质文化生活亦有所提高，工资有所增加，全国铁路职工自实行劳动保险以来，已有六十二万职工，一八七万家属直接享受到劳保待遇。一九五二年底全路共已扫除文盲五万人，并从一九五二年起在全路推行了速成识字法，现已有十四万七千人参加，并有二万一千多人参加了长期文化学习。二
    铁路工作是有成绩的，但存在的错误和缺点，也是严重的，主要表现在：
    第一、计划管理尚差，运输生产不平衡。从一九五○年起全国铁路有了第一个年度计划。但由于我们对铁路运输是服务于生产的，因而铁路必须根据国民经济发展的需要来制订运输计划的认识不够明确，对国民经济发展的比例，及货源货流的情况没有进行系统的研究，致使计划偏高偏低，掌握不定。一九五二年由于计划偏高，为完成任务，曾造成招揽货运的错误；而一九五三年又由于对国民经济发展情况估计不足，计划偏低，存在保守的缺点。由于缺乏货源货流的资料，使运行图与实际脱节，造成运行秩序紊乱。加以运输调度工作计划性与组织性不强，常常发生有车无货，有货无车及车种与货种不符等现象，造成运输力的浪费。客运方面，客车不足，不能满足旅客需要，加以售票方法不善，服务工作不够，更增加了旅客的困难。再次，由于我们对铁路设备能力及各种消费定额没有全面查定，心中无数，因此对基本建设的投资带有一定的盲目性。
    第二、指标冒进，质量不高，事故多。几年来由于苏联先进经验的推动与帮助，职工生产情绪的高涨，定额不断被冲破，这是很好的现象。但由于我们对新纪录的分析研究不够，对平均先进定额的理解不够，致对制订指标缺乏从实际出发；盲目要求提高，满足于数量，不重视质量；以致造成下级人员赶任务、赶指标，不遵守规章制度，不遵守劳动纪律，事故长期不能消灭并有所增多。因此从今年夏季定点开始，我们对于有些指标有意识地使之降低，以扭转冒进偏向，掌握稳步前进的原则。如货车周转时间从一九五二年的二·九天降低至三·○九天。
    第三、管理制度尚不健全，劳动组织很多地方不合理。全国铁路及其主要基层单位，虽然都已推行了经济核算制，但由于对这一社会主义的经营管理企业的方法认识不足，思想准备不够，因而很多单位“完成任务不算账”的思想，仍严重存在。在劳动组织方面，三班半制和三班、两班半、两班间歇制尚未普遍推行，很多地方仍沿用三班、两班轮班制，职工连续工作时间过长，影响工作效率及职工身体健康。此外，由于分工不明，有些单位人力有余，另一些单位则人力不够分配。就是在同一单位由于生产不平衡，有时人手感到多，而有时又必须加班加点，才能完成任务。由于缺乏职务细则，职责不明，使负责制不能很好贯彻。
    第四、在基本建设方面，没有把计划建立在可靠的基础上，对于主观力量估计过高，致新建工程计划过大。在制度上，我们虽已执行了基本建设、设计、施工三部门分工负责，互相约束的新制度，初步转变了军事抢修的方式与供给制的办法，但仍存在着很多缺点：设计力量薄弱，设计质量差，赶不上施工需要；在施工部门，计划管理差，施工准备不足，现场管理紊乱，工程进度不平衡，工程质量不好，成本高，浪费大。在基本建设的领导思想方面，存在着贪多冒进，在工程技术人员缺乏、设计力量薄弱、管理干部不足，尤其是对有计划的经济建设没有或很少实际经验的情况下，过多的拉开架子，多设摊子，分散了力量，使国家投资不能集中使用，推迟了重点建设工程。
    第五、对培养干部重视不够，解放以来通过各种形式，以提高职工政治、技术业务水平，至一九五二年底为止参加脱产与不脱产学习的职工共有二十一万二千九百四十三人，并已培养与提拔股长主任级以上领导干部一万六千四百九十三人。但自去年增加新线工程机构、调配新线工程人员以来，感到干部十分缺乏。这种情况证明几年来我们对干部问题缺乏通盘考虑，没有系统的培养计划，在提拔干部上不够大胆，因而干部的生长满足不了工作发展的需要。
    这些错误和缺点的产生，主要是由于铁道部领导上思想水平、政治水平不高，存在着主观主义、分散主义、官僚主义的毛病，满足于既得成绩，工作布置多，检查少，对现场情况了解不够，缺乏实事求是的工作作风，致使许多已被发现的缺点和错误，不能及时得到纠正。三
    随着国家第一个五年建设计划的开始，铁路运输任务更加繁重了，一九五三年国家批准的发送货物吨数较一九五二年增加了百分之六点二，货物周转量较一九五二年增加百分之六点五，旅客人数较一九五二年增加百分之六，货车周转时间缩短零点○二天，新线投资为一九五二年的百分之二三七，主要工程数量如以一九五二年为一○○，则一九五三年土石方为百分之二○六，隧道为百分之二三七，大中桥为百分之三一九，铺轨六○八公里，为去年的百分之一二六。
    由于对国民经济的发展估计不足，预见性不强，因此本年运输计划偏低。本年一至九月发送吨数已完成年计划的百分之八一·八。其中：煤焦百分之六九·三，钢铁及制品百分之八○·四，矿物性建筑材料百分之一二七，木材百分之七七·五，粮食百分之七三·四。旅客人数已完成年计划百分之九五·七。货车周转率完成了三·○九天，较计划延长了○·二一天。一至八月的货物周转量已完成年计划的百分之七六·二。旅客公里完成了年计划的百分之八七·五，上半年的运输成本较计划降低了百分之二三，劳动生产率提高了百分之二二，上缴利润则已完成了年计划的百分之一百。
    在基本建设计划方面，由于过高估计了主观力量，因此计划又偏高，本年上半年仅完成年计划的百分之十五。经第三季抓紧施工以后，各新建铁路至九月底止已完成了年计划的百分之六十五，正线铺轨四五九公里。其中西北的兰州至永登段计长一○三公里及西南的成都至绵阳段一一八公里，均于本年国庆日举行了通车典礼。但根据需要与可能相结合的原则，紧缩一些不可能完成的工程及不必要的项目，还是非常必要的。
    基于以上情况，响应国家“增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支，超额完成国家计划”的号召，我们决定增产节约三万一千亿元，紧缩投资一万亿元，共计四万一千亿元，根据本年九个月来完成运输生产任务的情况及目前国家号召增加生产，大力组织物资交流，是可以完成以至超额完成任务的。
    由于客货运量的日益增长，已经出现了客货车辆不敷及若干区段通、过能力不足的现象。这个矛盾随着国民经济进一步发展必然会更加尖锐，发展下去会严重阻碍国家经济建设的进程。因此除了加强党的领导，充分发动与组织广大职工群众，挖掘潜力，寻找窍门，发挥群众的积极性与创造性，尽最大可能利用现有设备外，必须详细查定线路及各项运输设备的能力，找出薄弱环节加强大修工作，并给予必要的投资，以克服困难，改进工作，才能保证顺利完成。四
    根据国家五年建设计划的总方针，国家给予全国铁路工作的根本任务是完成国家运输任务，为国家工业化和国防现代化服务，最大可能地满足国家经济建设、国防建设以及人民在生产上和生活上对铁路运输的日益增长的要求。为此，必须十分重视加强新线建设工作，以配合新的工业基地和国防基地的建立；并进一步发挥现有铁路的潜在力量，提高运输能力，降低成本为国家建设积累更多资金。根据“增加生产、厉行节约、重点建设、稳步前进”的方针，在可靠的基础上逐步地有重点地修建新线，并坚决改进营业铁路的经营管理工作，彻底改变旧的腐败的经营管理方法的残余，树立与加强社会主义经营管理的思想与制度，为此目的，必须遵照毛主席“学习苏联”的指示，切实学习与推广中长铁路的先进经验，要求全国各路在一定时期内逐步达到中长路的水平。这是全国铁路工作今后一定时间内的基本方向。
    为此，我们要认真做好下列几项主要工作：
    第一、组织学习原中长路经验，审查修改规章制度。首先在全路范围内统一和端正学习中长路先进经验的思想，认识到中长路经验是苏联先进经验和中国铁路具体情况相结合的典范。我们能够系统地学会与推广中长路先进经验，就可以使我们在经营管理铁路上少走许多弯路，迅速提高铁路经营管理水平，加速铁路建设的进程。在学习的要求上，部、局两级，要求学懂中长路完整的一套社会主义经营管理的基本知识，以及贯彻的方法与步骤，站、段、厂级根据做甚么学甚么的原则，学习中长路同一性质的专业经验。并结合学习中长路经验，取得苏联专家的帮助，根据我国铁路具体情况，修改现行规章制度，各局亦应根据具体情况，订出步骤，采取边学边做的方法逐步推行。学习与推广中长路先进经验的好坏，是决定我们人民铁路能否继续提高的关键。因此，必须按期进行检查总结，及时交流经验，纠正偏向。
    第二、加强计划管理，养成严格遵守计划纪律的工作作风。正常地系统地研究货源货流的情况，以便制订切实可行的运输计划，做好原始记录与定额工作，以加强计划管理的基础。并做好作业计划与运输调度、工作调度、生产调度工作，根据运输计划，制订日班计划、列车编组计划和改进各种技术作业过程，加强调度工作的计划性与纪律性，严格按照运输计划与编组计划调配机车车辆，严格按照运行图行车，坚决克服本位主义与不认真执行调度命令的无组织、无纪律现象，十分注意查定和计算铁路现有设备能力，以为编制基本建设计划的根据。同时加强财务监督制度以保证计划的贯彻执行。
    第三、合理调整劳动组织，建立负责制，加强劳动纪律，坚决的逐步改革不合理的三班、两班轮班制。根据具体情况实行三班半轮班制或三班、两班间歇制，合并重叠机构，处理多余人员，制定职务细则，明确职责范围以克服劳逸不均与无人负责的现象，并大力纠正劳动纪律松懈，不遵守操作规程、技术规程的违法乱纪现象，以逐步减少行车事故。
    第四、在基本建设方面，严格根据需要与可能相结合的原则，来审查过去的计划，凡可做可不做的坚决不做，可以推迟的予以推迟，坚决削减那些不必要的项目及目前无力进行的工作，以保证重点工程的按期完成。充实设计力量，十分重视设计资料的搜集研究，减少和逐步消灭设计的反工，提高设计质量，树立总体设计思想，推行设计负责制，广泛采用定型设计，制订切实可行的预算定额，以编制设计预算。施工方面应严格根据设计以提高质量为主，在此基础上缩短建设期限，减少建设成本，达到“好、快、省”的全面要求。为此拟即大力加强新工的计划管理和逐步推行经济核算制，培养新工干部，积累经验，为今后建设打下基础。
    第五、大力培养干部，根据铁路发展的需要，拟订培养干部的久远计划，有步骤有系统地开办各种专业训练班，提倡和切实帮助带徒培养方式，以提高在职干部和工人的业务水平和技术水平。在现场加设副职，以培养成套干部。加强对铁道学院及中级技术学校技工学校的领导。重视培养并大胆提拔工人干部，稳步地提高干部质量，以适应国家经济建设的需要。五
    为了保证完成上述方针任务，我们要加强铁路工作中的思想工作和政治工作，克服干部中的骄傲自满和盲目冒进的思想，以保证学习与推广中长路先进经验的方针贯彻执行。其次，在各级干部及全体职工中树立为国家经济建设服务特别是为工业建设服务，具体的为货主服务的观念。主动帮助货主，联系货主，照顾货主的具体困难。并制订铁路运输条例，在法律上明确铁路与货主的关系。再次，继续深入进行爱国主义教育，组织劳动竞赛，巩固劳动纪律，不断的启发职工的劳动积极性和创造性。最后应结合当前工作继续开展反官僚主义斗争，克服领导机关和领导干部中的主观主义、分散主义、官僚主义和基层单位的“五多”现象。如果我们把上述工作做好，提高思想水平和政治水平，我们坚决相信完全有把握完成国家所给予的任务的。
