    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th: The Tongchengzha Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hanshan County, Anhui Province, helped farmers win a victorious struggle against grain speculators. The business of the supply and marketing cooperative has also developed.

    Tongchengzha in Hanshan County, Anhui Province, is a place rich in rice. In the past, whenever new grain was not yet ripe, and farmers were in difficult times between harvests, grain speculators from Nanjing, Wuxi, Yangzhou, and Wuhu would come to this place to buy "green seedlings" at very low prices. In those difficult years, local farmers compared grain speculators to "lice." This year, before the rice was harvested, these speculative grain merchants went to Tongchengzha again to buy "green seedlings," claiming to be "helping" the farmers. At this time, there was a major rain disaster in the area, and crops were flooded. The grain speculators saw no hope for the green seedlings and left. When the local people's government vigorously led the farmers to drain the water and rescue the crops, and applied additional fertilizer, and the rice harvest was about to be promising, these grain speculators emerged again. This year, although the local people's government issued more than 830 million yuan in agricultural loans in two districts near Tongchengzha, farmers still had many difficulties in their lives due to the rain disaster. Grain speculators took the opportunity to buy more than 640,000 catties of rice "green seedlings" from more than 1,400 relatively poor farmers in the Tongchengzha area. The price of these rice was only 41,900 yuan per 100 catties, while the state's purchase price at that time was 64,000 yuan. Many local farmers could not bear this harsh exploitation by grain speculators and went to the people's government to accuse the grain merchants of their crimes. After selling green seedlings, according to the calculation of the grain speculators, Guo Shiyou, the village chief of Qiaotou Village, would have all the rice harvested this year from the land he was allocated during the land reform, all exploited by the grain speculators. Guo Shiyou said that in the past, many poor farmers in our village sold "green seedlings" every year, were exploited every year, and could never turn over. Farmer Guo Changyuan said: "This year, we don't know how much sweat we have put into the rice harvest. If we let the profiteers exploit us like this, what will we rely on to increase production next year!" According to the requirements of the farmers, the local supply and marketing cooperative handled pre-purchase business with farmers at the state price. After the farmers received the pre-purchase payment from the supply and marketing cooperative, they repaid the money for selling "green seedlings" and drove away the batch of grain speculators. The pre-purchase price of the supply and marketing cooperative only increased and did not decrease, which protected the interests of the farmers and was warmly supported by the farmers. After the rice harvest, the farmers quickly delivered the pre-sold rice to the cooperative.

    On this basis, the Tongchengzha Supply and Marketing Cooperative developed its business. The number of members increased from more than 1,000 to more than 5,000, and the funds within the cooperative increased rapidly. The types of commodities managed expanded from more than 200 to more than 600. The turnover in the third quarter of this year increased by nearly two times compared with the same period last year. Ninety percent of the things bought by farmers in the Houhe Township near the supply and marketing cooperative were bought from the cooperative. The result of the supply and marketing cooperative supplying commodities to members and non-members and purchasing agricultural and sideline products this year has exempted farmers from intermediate exploitation by merchants by more than 370 million yuan. Before and after the autumn harvest, the supply and marketing cooperative purchased farm tools such as rice baskets and brooms to supply to farmers. Due to the sufficient supply from the supply and marketing cooperative, the prices of some farm tools on the market have also decreased.

    在盛产稻谷的安徽省含山县铜城闸
    供销合作社帮助农民打败了粮食投机商
    【新华社合肥十九日电】安徽省含山县铜城闸供销合作社帮助农民和粮食投机商进行了胜利的斗争。供销社的业务也有了发展。
    安徽省含山县铜城闸一带是个盛产稻谷的地方。过去，每当新谷还未成熟农民在青黄不接的困难时节，南京、无锡、扬州及芜湖等地的粮食投机商们便到这个地方来用很低的价钱购买“青苗”。当地农民在那困难的年份，把粮食投机商比做“虱子”。今年，在稻谷收割以前，这些投机粮商又去到铜城闸买“青苗”，并且说是给农民“救急”来了。这时当地大雨成灾，庄稼被淹。粮食投机商看青苗无望，便袖手走了。待当地人民政府大力领导农民排涝抢救，加施追肥，稻子收成快要有望的时候，这些粮食投机商又钻出来了。今年，虽然当地人民政府在铜城闸附近两个区发放了八亿三千多万元的农业贷款，但在雨灾的情况下，农民生活上还有许多困难，粮食投机商便乘机在铜城闸一带向一千四百多户较困难的农民买了六十四万多斤稻谷的“青苗”，这些稻谷的价格每一百市斤仅为四万一千九百元，而当时国家的收购价格却是六万四千元。当地许多农民不堪粮食投机商这种苛重的盘剥，纷纷到人民政府控诉粮商的罪行。桥头村村长过士有卖青苗后，按粮食投机商的算法，他在土地改革时分到的田地今年所收的稻谷，将全部被粮食投机商剥削去。过士有说，过去，我们全村有许多贫农就是这样年年卖“青苗”，年年受剥削、年年转不过身的。农民过常远说：“今年我们粮食的收成不知费了多少血汗，再让奸商这样剥削，我们明年靠什么去增产啊！”当地供销合作社根据农民的要求，按国家牌价向农民办理了预购业务。农民领到供销社的预购款后，即偿还了卖“青苗”的钱，赶走了这批粮食投机商。供销社预购的价格从涨不从落，保障了农民的利益，受到农民的热烈拥护。稻谷收割后，农民很快把预售的稻谷送到了合作社。
    铜城闸供销合作社在这个基础上，发展了业务。社员由一千多人增加到五千多人，社内的资金迅速增加。所经营的商品种类由二百多种扩大到六百多种。今年第三季度的营业额比去年同期增加了将近两倍。供销合作社附近后河乡农民所买进的东西，有百分之九十是从合作社买来的。合作社今年供应社员和非社员的商品以及收购农副产品的结果，使农民免除商人中间剥削达三亿七千多万元。秋收前后，供销社采购了稻篓、扫帚等农具供应农民。由于供销社充分供应，市面上有些农具的价格也降低了。
