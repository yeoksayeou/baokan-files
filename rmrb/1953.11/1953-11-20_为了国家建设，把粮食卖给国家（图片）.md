Selling Grain to the State for National Construction
    The 300,000 mu of rice paddies in the suburbs of Tianjin have yielded a total harvest of over 188 million jin of rice. Here, members of the Jiang Deyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Jinan suburban area of the rice-producing region are loading the dried rice, ready to sell it to the state.

    In October, the purchasing tasks completed by the various purchasing stations in the Jinan suburban area exceeded the original planned target for October by 63 percent. This is the mountain of rice piled up at the Xiaozhan Town Business Office purchasing station of the Tianjin Grain Company.

    The Xiaozhan Town Business Office of the Tianjin Grain Company is loading some of the purchased grain onto ships, ready to be transported by water to the urban area of Tianjin to supply the needs of urban workers and citizens.

    The Liancun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xiaozhan Town, Jinan suburban area, has prepared a large quantity of cloth and daily necessities. After the farmers sell their grain, they come here to select the things they need.

    After selling their grain to the state, farmers go to the livestock market to buy livestock in order to expand production and strive for an even greater harvest next year.

    为了国家建设，把粮食卖给国家
    天津市郊区三十万亩水稻共收获稻谷一亿八千余万斤。这是水稻产区的津南郊区姜德玉农业生产合作社的社员们正在装运晒干的稻谷，准备卖给国家。
    在十月份内，津南郊区各收购站完成的收购任务超过了十月份原计划的百分之六十三。这是天津市粮食公司小站镇营业所收购处堆积如山的稻谷。
    天津市粮食公司小站镇营业所把收购来的一部分粮食装上船，准备经水路运往天津市区，供给城市工人和市民的需要。
    津南郊区小站镇联村供销合作社准备了大量布匹和日用品。农民卖了粮食后就到这里来选购自己需要的东西。
    农民把粮食卖给国家以后，到牲口市场购买牲口，以便扩大生产，争取明年更大的丰收。
