The Korean-Chinese Side Decides to Publish the Confessions of Nineteen American Air Force Prisoners of War
Further Confirming the U.S. Government's Crimes of Germ Warfare
(Xinhua News Agency, November 11th) To further confirm the U.S. government's crimes of germ warfare, the Korean-Chinese side has decided to publish the confessions of nineteen American Air Force prisoners of war. Based on the various reliable evidence obtained by the Korean-Chinese side, the investigations by international authoritative scientists, and the facts already confessed by American Air Force prisoners of war, it has already been proven that the U.S. government, since the winter of 1951, has extensively used bacteriological weapons aimed at slaughtering the peaceful people of Korea and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and in 1952, it again massively intruded into Chinese airspace to spread bacteria, attempting to kill Chinese peaceful residents. Now, the publication of the confessions of nineteen American Air Force prisoners of war further proves that this most brutal and barbaric act of the U.S. government, which violates human morality, undermines the principles of international law, and international conventions, cannot be denied.

As is well known, the U.S. began large-scale research on bacteriological warfare methods as early as 1941. After World War II, the U.S. also used Japanese germ warfare criminals such as Shiro Ishii to inherit the research on germ warfare methods of the Japanese militarists, thereby developing the manufacture of various types of bacteriological weapons.

After the U.S. government launched the war of aggression against Korea, it stepped up its research and development of bacteriological weapons. At the same time, the highest U.S. military authorities were preparing to use bacteriological weapons for germ warfare in Korea. According to the confession of captured U.S. Air Force Colonel Mahurin, in the autumn of 1950, Teale, Deputy Director of the Air Force Secretary's Office, told him: "Senior military leaders, such as General Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Vandenberg, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Collins, Chief of Staff of the Army, and Admiral Sherman, Chief of Naval Operations, believe that bacteriological weapons are both effective and cheap, so they should be developed to occupy a certain position in the category of weapons. Although the Korean War was progressing smoothly at that time, the future is unpredictable. Therefore, due to the uncertainty of the future situation, the bacteriological warfare plan is entering the experimental and development stage."

Mahurin also confessed that in November 1950, he was ordered to visit the Detrick Camp in Frederick, Maryland, and personally visited a large-scale germ bomb research center. He saw a hollow steel ball with a diameter of about sixty feet, specially designed for experimenting with the explosion of germ bombs and the lethal effect of bacteria on animals, heated greenhouses for cultivating various crop fungi, laboratories for testing, cultivating and storing bacteria, and large open spaces used to judge the impact of aircraft bombing on various organisms in that area. He personally witnessed the experimental explosion of a germ bomb. Captured U.S. Air Force Colonel Evans also confessed that he had heard lectures on the development of bacteriological weapons while studying at the Air Force Military Academy. He said: "In mid-September 1951, a research analyst from the 'Research and Development Command' in Baltimore, Maryland, gave us two one-hour lectures. These lectures were about various disease-causing bacteria being tested and methods of spreading them." Captured U.S. Air Force Second Lieutenant Kerr confessed that on March 20, 1952, Training Squadron Commander Major McEntyre, when lecturing on the historical background of germ warfare, said: "Bacteriological weapons have not been used on a large scale until the Korean War. During World War II, the Japanese used germ warfare on a relatively small scale against the Chinese. After the war, the U.S. government urged its scientists to step up the research on germ warfare that had begun during the war. With the help of foreign scientists, they have developed it to an unprecedented extent. When our government realized that it could not win the war in Korea with our existing armed forces alone, it decided to use bacteriological weapons." This also proves that the U.S. has been preparing for a long time and in a planned manner to research, develop, and manufacture this harmful and heinous bacteriological weapon. This is why the U.S. government has repeatedly refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological weapons.

The U.S. military invading Korea, in order to observe the effects of bacteriological weapons, used captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to conduct inhumane bacteriological weapon experiments. As is well known, the U.S. military's No. 1091 bacteriological landing craft sailed to the waters outside Wonsan Port in March 1951, using captured Chinese People's Volunteers as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. Soon, this landing craft sailed to Geoje Island to carry out the same heinous activities. On May 18 of the same year, the Associated Press also revealed that they had obtained cultures of bacteria from the mouths and intestines of prisoners of war, and conducted more than 3,000 experiments every day in the ship's laboratory, resulting in "1,400 of the more than 125,000 North Korean prisoners held on the island becoming seriously ill, and about 80 percent of the rest suffering from some kind of disease." After continuous research and heinous experiments, the U.S. government has reached a state of complete preparation for conducting bacteriological warfare. Therefore, when the U.S. aggressor troops suffered military defeats on the Korean battlefield, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to begin bacteriological warfare against Korea and China. According to the confession of Hubbell, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Marine Corps First Air Wing, who was captured, "The overall plan for bacteriological warfare in Korea was instructed by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1951." Bley, Ordnance Officer of the U.S. Marine Corps First Air Wing, Mahurin, Commander of the Fourth Fighter-Interceptor Group, and Evans, Deputy Commander of the 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing, who were captured, also confessed one after another that the U.S. began bacteriological warfare in Korea in the winter of 1951.

The purpose of the U.S. conducting bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people was to use this brutal method of warfare to intimidate the Korean and Chinese people and save their military defeats. Mahurin confessed that the U.S. government "hoped that negotiations might be affected by this plan (the bacteriological warfare plan), which might lead to a satisfactory outcome." U.S. Air Force prisoner of war Kerr confessed that they fantasized that bacteriological warfare "would cause infectious diseases, which would lead to a lack of front-line troops and manpower in the rear. It should demoralize the people to the point of giving up fighting." Another Air Force prisoner of war, Frick, said that they fantasized about using bacteriological warfare to reverse the failure of their Air Force's "strangulation warfare." They believed: "The Chinese and North Korean troops have an absolute advantage in numbers, far beyond what our troops can cope with, and their fortifications are dug too well, so ordinary bombs cannot harm them. Therefore, we must use everything that can kill them, and the answer lies in our effective use of germ bombs."

Thus, starting in the winter of 1951, the U.S. military began bacteriological warfare in Korea.

In December 1951, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff made a further decision to include the task of dropping bacteriological weapons north of the Yalu River in the bacteriological warfare plan. Mahurin confessed: "From January 10, 1952, we began to receive regular instructions from the Fifth Air Force Headquarters regarding the task of dropping bacteriological weapons. When I was in the 51st Wing, we received an average of ten instructions per month regarding the task of dropping bacteriological weapons, of which two or three stipulated that we should go north of the Yalu River to carry them out." Air Force personnel who were assigned to carry out the task of intruding into Chinese airspace were also specially selected. Mahurin confessed: "Due to the danger involved, the tasks of flying north of the Yalu River were all assigned to experienced pilots." U.S. Air Force prisoners of war Geroneau and Hanmer further pointed out that the U.S. attempted to cover up its crimes and told U.S. Air Force personnel who were conducting bacteriological warfare by intruding into Chinese airspace: "If you are hit in Manchuria, immediately drop the germ bombs and tell your captors that this is due to your getting lost"; "and most importantly, never mention germ bombs."

The purpose of the U.S. military invading China to conduct bacteriological warfare was to vainly attempt to achieve the goal of invading China and threatening the security of the Chinese people by means of mass slaughter of Chinese peaceful residents. Frick confessed that the U.S. military authorities blatantly stated in lectures to Air Force personnel: "To end the war successfully and quickly, it is necessary to conduct bacteriological warfare in North Korea and Northeast China. The enemy's supply lines pass through Northeast China and Korea. We must do anything we can to stop supplies from reaching the front lines. We must destroy their manpower in large quantities so that they cannot continue to effectively transport supplies to Korea. We must undermine the will of the Chinese and Korean people and make them demand an end to the war."

After the U.S. bacteriological warfare in Korea began in the winter of 1951, the scale of the war increased day by day. According to the verbal instructions from Fifth Air Force Commander Barcus regarding the expansion of bacteriological warfare, they wanted to establish a "contaminated zone" across the central part of the Korean Peninsula, attempting to use this to cooperate with their so-called "strangulation warfare" plan to destroy our transportation lines. In order to realize this vicious plan, the U.S. Air Force mobilized great strength and carried out meticulous division of labor. The Marine Corps First Air Wing was responsible for the left wing of this target area, namely the Sinanju and Kunu-ri area, the Air Force was responsible for the area from Kunu-ri to about thirty miles from the east coast, and the Navy was responsible for the right wing. In 1952, the U.S. Air Force's 3rd Light Bomber Wing, 17th Light Bomber Wing, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing, 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing, 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing, 474th Fighter-Bomber Wing, Marine Corps First Air Wing, and others also participated in the bacteriological war one after another. The aircraft participating in the bacteriological war included B-29 bombers, B-26 light bombers, F-51, F-80, F-84, F-86, and Marine Corps night fighters and other types of fighter-bombers and fighters. The means of spreading bacteria also became more cunning, often mixing the task of spreading bacteria with the task of dropping ordinary bombs at the same time, so that the Korean and Chinese people could not easily detect it. When spreading bacteria, the U.S. Air Force tried its best to spread bacteria in places where "effects are easily seen," such as spreading bacteria in densely populated areas and areas where troops are concentrated, or dropping bacteriological weapons on transportation hubs, highways, and railway bridges, or spreading bacteria after destroying highways and railways, so that road repair workers would be infected with diseases, in order to delay and hinder the repair of highways and railways. Secondly, bacteria were spread in rivers and drinking water sources to pollute the water source, attempting to directly cause large-scale deaths of the Korean and Chinese people and troops.

In 1952, the U.S. military stepped up its bacteriological warfare attacks on Northeast China. The investigation report of the International Scientific Commission and the confessions of American prisoners of war fully prove this. In the period from February 29 to March 21, 1952 alone, U.S. aircraft that intruded into Chinese airspace totaled 175 sorties, 955 sorties. The intrusion areas included 70 counties and districts in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces. In addition to using strafing and bombing to harm residents and destroy houses, these aircraft also spread insects, rodents, and other objects carrying germs and viruses. After March, the U.S., ignoring the protest of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, continued to intrude into Chinese airspace to carry out heinous bacteriological warfare and strafing and bombing.

However, due to the effective measures taken by the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the Korean and Chinese people to counter bacteriological warfare, the U.S. government's bacteriological warfare plan was completely defeated. In October 1952, White, Director of Operations of the U.S. Air Force Headquarters, appointed captured Andre J. Evans Jr. to go to Korea to investigate the situation and effects of the Fifth Air Force's bacteriological warfare. In November 1952, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg personally went to Korea, accompanied by Fifth Air Force Commander Barcus, to inspect the progress of the bacteriological war. Vandenberg was disappointed with the effects of the bacteriological war. He ordered the Fifth Air Force to make good use of fighter-bombers to conduct bacteriological warfare at night, and instructed Barcus to formulate a detailed plan on the details of the proportion of night-time bacteriological weapon dropping tasks, the supply of weapons, the selection of targets, and the number of trained pilots. According to Evans, "Three F-84 aircraft wings and one F-80 aircraft wing were to participate in this plan." Two wings were to be dispatched every night, with eight aircraft each, to carry out all evening operations, and two of the eight aircraft in each wing were to be responsible for bacteriological warfare tasks. From January 10, 1953, the Fifth Air Force, under the direct planning of Washington, launched a large-scale attack on the Sinanju area. In this attack, four aircraft from each fighter-bomber wing and each Marine Corps air group were to be drawn each day to carry bacteriological weapons. Two B-26 aircraft were to carry bacteriological weapons every day. This attack lasted for five consecutive days, with a maximum of 480 sorties of aircraft dispatched each day. This was one of the rarest and most violent crimes committed by the U.S. military in the Korean War.

The U.S. military used many methods and types of bacteriological weapons to spread bacteria in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China. According to reliable investigations and the confessions of captured U.S. Air Force personnel, there were 500-pound bomb-type germ bombs, 1,000-pound bomb-type germ bombs, parachute-type germ bombs, "door-type" germ bombs, tank-type germ containers, etc.; in addition, spraying methods were also used.

The U.S. Air Force has listed bacteriological warfare training as an important part of regular flight training. U.S. Air Force personnel participating in bacteriological warfare have received specialized training on the complex details and operating procedures of conducting bacteriological warfare, either before going abroad or in Japan and Korea. The content generally includes the purpose of conducting bacteriological warfare, the history of bacteriological warfare, the types of bacteria and bacteriological weapons, and various possible methods of conducting bacteriological warfare, etc.

In order to cover up its crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare, U.S. imperialism stipulated a strict confidentiality system for Air Force personnel. When lecturing on bacteriological warfare courses, instructors often warned Air Force personnel that the content of the course was "top secret," "not to be discussed with anyone," "no written materials were allowed," and that the word "bacteria" must not be mentioned under any circumstances. Call signs, orders, and reports during missions had to use code names and secret words, such as using "super propaganda," "non-explosive bombs," "special John," and "special missions" to replace "germ bombs" and "bacteriological warfare missions." Pilots were warned that if they violated confidentiality, they would be subject to "court-martial."

During their captivity, some U.S. Air Force prisoners of war, facing undeniable evidence and moved by the consistent lenient treatment of prisoners of war by the Korean-Chinese side, confessed to the facts of the U.S. military's bacteriological warfare, exposing the U.S. government's despicable plan to use bacteria against humanity. Therefore, any lies claiming that the Korean-Chinese side extracted confessions by coercion are not worth refuting. According to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea protesting against the bacteriological warfare by the U.S. aggressors and the statement of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on March 8, 1952, these prisoners of war should have been subjected to due punishment for their criminal acts. However, the Korean-Chinese side, considering that they were all carrying out orders from superiors and were not the main responsible persons for planning and launching the bacteriological war, and that they were able to confess their guilt frankly after committing the crime, decided to treat them leniently and repatriate them all. This action once again embodies the humanitarian and magnanimous spirit of the Korean-Chinese side.

The above are all ironclad facts of the U.S.'s inhumane bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people. These ironclad facts cannot be overturned by any lies or despicable means of denial.

### 朝中方面决定发表十九个美国空军战俘的供词  进一步证实美国政府进行细菌战罪行

    朝中方面决定发表十九个美国空军战俘的供词
    进一步证实美国政府进行细菌战罪行
    【新华社十一日讯】为了进一步证实美国政府进行细菌战的罪行，朝中方面决定发表十九个美国空军战俘的供词。本来根据朝中方面所得到的各种确实证据、国际权威科学家的调查以及前已发表美国空军战俘供认的事实，已经证明美国政府自一九五一年冬季起，曾大规模地使用了以屠杀朝鲜和平人民及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为目的的细菌武器，至一九五二年又大规模地侵入中国领空撒布细菌，企图杀害中国的和平居民。现在，十九个美国空军战俘的供词的发表，更加证明：美国政府这种违犯人类道德、破坏国际法原则及国际公约的最残暴、最野蛮的行为，是不容抵赖的。
    如所周知，美国早在一九四一年即开始了关于细菌战方法的大规模研究。第二次世界大战后，美国又借助日本细菌战犯石井四郎等，继承了日本军阀的细菌战方法的研究，从而发展了各种类型细菌武器的制造。
    美国政府发动侵略朝鲜战争以后，更加紧了对细菌武器的研究与发展工作，美国最高军事当局同时着着准备在朝鲜使用细菌武器进行细菌战。据被俘的美国空军上校马胡林供称：一九五○年秋空军部长办公室副主任蒂尔对他说过：“高级军事领袖们，如参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷将军，空军参谋长范顿伯将军，陆军参谋长柯林斯将军和海军作战部长薛尔曼将军，都认为细菌武器既有效，又便宜，故应该加以发展，使其在武器这个范畴中，占有一定的地位。虽然朝鲜战争在当时正在顺利地进行，但是将来是不可能预料的，因此，由于未来局势之难以确定，细菌战计划正进入试验、发展阶段。”
    马胡林又供认，他在一九五○年十一月，奉令到马里兰州佛烈德利克的狄特里克兵营，亲自参观过一个规模很大的细菌弹研究中心。他看到了有为着实验细菌弹爆炸和细菌对动物致命效果而专设的直径约六十英尺的空心钢球，有培养各种农作物真菌的保暖花房，有化验、培养与贮存细菌的实验室，还有几大片旷场，用来判断飞机投弹后对该处各种不同生物的影响，他并亲自见到了一枚细菌弹的实验爆炸。被俘的美国空军上校爱文斯也供认他在空军军事学院学习时，曾听到关于发展细菌武器的讲课。他说：“一九五一年九月中旬，从马里兰州巴尔的摩的‘研究与发展指挥部’来的一位研究分析家给我们做了两次为时各一小时的讲课。这些讲课是关于正在试验中的各种引起疾病的细菌和散布它们的方法。”被俘的美国空军少尉克尔供认，一九五二年三月二十日，训练中队长麦克英特少校讲授细菌战历史背景时说：“直到朝鲜战争以前，细菌武器尚未大规模使用。在第二次大战中，日本人曾以比较小的规模对中国人进行细菌战。战后美国政府使本国科学家加紧这种在战争期间已开始了的细菌战研究。借外国科学家的帮助，他们已将它发展到从所未有的最大程度。当我国政府认识到仅以我们已有的武装部队不能在朝鲜赢得战争时，便决定使用细菌武器。”这也证明了美国研究、发展和制造这种危害人类的、罪恶的细菌武器是经过了长期有计划准备的。这就是为什么美国政府一再拒绝批准禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的原因。
    侵朝美军，为了观察细菌武器的效果，曾以朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行惨无人道的细菌武器试验。众所周知，美军第一○九一号细菌登陆艇就在一九五一年三月间开到元山港外，以中国人民志愿军被俘人员作为细菌武器的试验品。不久，这艘登陆艇又开到巨济岛进行同样的罪恶活动。同年五月十八日美联社还透露，他们从战俘体内取得了口与肠的病菌培养物，每天在船上的实验室里进行三千多次试验，结果使岛上“关着的十二万五千多北朝鲜俘虏中，有一千四百人病得很厉害，其余的人约有百分之八十染有某种疾病”。美国政府，经过了连续不断的研究与罪恶的实验之后，已经达到了进行细菌战的完全准备状态。所以当美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上遭受着军事上的失败的时候，美国参谋长联席会议作出决定，对朝鲜及中国开始进行细菌战。据被俘的美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长许威布尔供称：“在朝鲜的细菌战的总计划，是由美国参谋长联席会议在一九五一年十月指示的。”被俘的美国海军陆战队第一空军联队军械官布莱、第四战斗截击机大队大队长马胡林及第五十八战斗轰炸机联队副联队长爱文斯也曾先后供称，美国在朝鲜进行细菌战是在一九五一年冬季开始的。
    美国对朝中人民进行细菌战的目的，是想以这种残暴的作战方法，吓倒朝中人民，挽救他们的军事失败。马胡林曾供认：美国政府“希望谈判可能会受到此计划（细菌战计划）的影响，从而可能产生一个满意的结果。”美国空军战俘克尔供认：他们幻想着细菌战“会引起传染病，因而会造成前线部队和后方人力的缺乏。它应该会使人民的士气低落到放弃作战的地步。”另一个空军战俘弗立克说：他们幻想用细菌战挽回其空军“绞杀战”的失败，他们认为：“中国和北朝鲜军队数量上占绝对优势，远非我们军队所能应付，并且他们的工事挖的太好，以致通常的炸弹不能伤害他们，所以，我们必须使用一切能杀害他们的东西，答案就在于我们对细菌弹的有效使用。”
    于是，从一九五一年冬季起，美国军队在朝鲜开始了细菌战。
    一九五一年十二月，美国参谋长联席会议作出进一步的决定，把在鸭绿江以北投掷细菌武器的任务也包括在细菌战计划内。马胡林供认：“从一九五二年一月十日起，我们开始接到第五航空队司令部关于投掷细菌武器任务的定期指令。当我在第五十一联队时，我们平均每月接到十次投掷细菌武器任务的指令，其中二、三次规定要到鸭绿江以北去执行。”对执行侵入中国领空的任务的空军人员也是经过特别选择的，马胡林供称：“飞往鸭绿江以北的任务，由于其所包含的危险性，故均指派有经验的驾驶员去执行。”美国空军战俘耿诺和汉麦更指出，美国企图掩盖其罪行，对侵犯中国领空进行细菌战的美国空军人员说：“假如你们在满洲境内被击中，立即投下细菌弹，并告诉你们的俘获者，这是由于你们迷途之故”；“而最重要的是绝不要提及细菌弹”。
    美军侵入中国进行细菌战的目的，是妄想以大量残杀中国和平人民的手段，来达到侵略中国威胁中国人民安全的目的。弗立克供认，美军当局在对空军人员的讲课中露骨地说：“要成功和迅速地结束战争，在北朝鲜及中国东北进行细菌战是必要的。敌人供应线穿过中国东北和朝鲜，我们必须做任何我们所能做的事来阻止供应物资抵达前线，我们必须大量摧毁他们的人力，以使他们不能继续有效地运送物资到朝鲜来，我们必须破坏中国和朝鲜人民的意志，使他们要求停止战争。”
    美国在朝鲜所进行的细菌战自一九五一年冬开始后，规模日益扩大。按照第五航空队司令巴克斯口头传达的关于扩大细菌战的指示，他们要建立一条横贯朝鲜半岛中部的“沾染地带”，企图以此配合其所谓“绞杀战”计划，破坏我方运输线，为了要实现这一毒恶的计划，美国空军动员了极大的力量，并进行了细密的分工，海军陆战队第一空军联队负责这一目标地区的左翼，即新安州与军隅里地带，空军负责自军隅里到距东海岸约三十英里的地区，海军则负责右翼。一九五二年，美国空军第三轻轰炸机联队、第十七轻轰炸机联队、第四战斗截击机联队、第五十一战斗截击机联队、第八战斗轰炸机联队、第十八战斗轰炸机联队、第四十九战斗轰炸机联队、第五十八战斗轰炸机联队、第四七四战斗轰炸机联队、海军陆战队第一空军联队等也都先后参加了细菌战。参与细菌战的飞机有B—二九型轰炸机、B—二六型轻轰炸机，F—五一、F—八○、F—八四、F—八六及海军陆战队的夜间战斗机等类型的战斗轰炸机与战斗机。撒布细菌的手段也益趋狡猾，经常将撒布细菌的任务与投掷普通炸弹的任务混合在一起同时执行，这样，使朝中人民不易察觉。在撒布细菌时，美国空军更尽量使细菌撒布在“易见功效”的地方，如将细菌撒布在人口稠密的地方与军队集结的地区，或将细菌武器投掷在交通要道，公路与铁路桥梁处，或将公路及铁路破坏后，即撒布细菌，使修路工人感染疾病，以延缓与阻碍公路与铁路的修复。其次是将细菌撒布在河流与饮水处，以污染水源，企图直接造成朝中人民与军队的大批死亡。
    一九五二年，美军更加紧了对中国东北的细菌战攻击。国际科学委员会调查报告书与美国战俘供词，对此作了充分证明。仅自一九五二年二月二十九日起到三月二十一日止的时间内，侵入中国领空的美国飞机即共达一百七十五批，九百五十五架次。侵入地区包括辽东、辽西、吉林、松江、黑龙江等省的七十个县区。这些飞机除用扫射轰炸伤害居民、毁坏民房以外，还撒布了带有病菌、病毒的昆虫、啮齿动物及其他物体。三月以后美国不顾中华人民共和国外交部周恩来部长的抗议，继续不断地侵入中国领空进行罪恶的细菌战和扫射轰炸。
    然而，由于朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军及朝中人民采取了反细菌战的有效措施，美国政府的细菌战计划，遭到了彻底的失败。一九五二年十月美国空军总部作战部部长怀特指派被俘的小安德烈·杰·爱文斯往朝鲜考察第五航空队进行细菌战的情况与效果。一九五二年十一月，美国空军参谋长范顿伯更亲自到朝鲜，在第五航空队司令巴克斯的陪同下，检查了细菌战进行的情况。范顿伯对细菌战的效果感到失望，他命令第五航空队要很好的使用战斗轰炸机在夜间进行细菌战，并责成巴克斯拟定关于夜间投掷细菌武器的任务比重、武器的供应量、目标的选择及受过训练的驾驶员数目等细节问题的详细计划。据爱文斯供称：“三个F—八四型飞机联队和一个F—八○型飞机联队都要参加这个计划，”每天晚上派出两个联队，每个联队各派出八架飞机以进行一切晚间的作战行动，而每个联队的八架飞机中的两架则要担任细菌战方面的任务。一九五三年一月十日起，第五航空队在华盛顿的直接策划下，发动了规模巨大的对新安州地区的攻击，在这次攻击中，每个战斗轰炸机联队与海军陆战队各航空大队每天出动的飞机中，各要抽出四架飞机携带细菌武器。B—二六型飞机中每天要有二架携带细菌武器，这次攻击，连续进行了五天，最多时每天出动了飞机四百八十架次，这是朝鲜战争中美军所进行的、世所罕见的狂暴罪行之一。
    美军在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国境内撒布细菌的方法和细菌武器的类型很多。根据切实的调查与曾经被俘的美国空军人员的供述，有五百磅炸弹型细菌弹、一千磅炸弹型细菌弹、降落伞型细菌弹、“门型”细菌弹、油箱型细菌容器等；此外，还使用了喷射方法。
    美国空军已把细菌战的训练列为正规飞行训练中的重要组成部分，参与细菌战的美国空军人员，或在出国之前，或在日本和朝鲜，都受过关于进行细菌战的复杂情节与操作程序的专门训练。其内容一般是进行细菌战的目的、细菌战的历史、细菌与细菌武器的种类、以及进行细菌战的各种可能的方法等等。
    美帝国主义为了掩盖其进行细菌战的罪行，他们对空军人员规定了严格的保密制度，在讲细菌战课程时，教官们经常告诫空军人员说，课程的内容是“绝密”的，“不得与任何人谈论”，“不许有任何书面材料”，在任何情况下不得提及“细菌”字样。在执行任务时的呼号以及传达命令和汇报都必须用代号和暗语，如以“超级宣传”、“不爆炸的炸弹”、“特殊约翰”、“特殊任务”等来代替“细菌弹”和“细菌战任务”。飞行员们都受到警告，如果违反保密，就要受“军事审判”。
    美国的一些空军战俘在被俘期间，面对着无可抵赖的证据，和朝中方面一贯宽待战俘政策的感召，供认了美军进行细菌战的事实，暴露了美国政府卑怯的用细菌对付人类的恶毒计划。因此，任何说朝中方面逼供的谎言，都是不值得一驳的。根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的声明与中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来于一九五二年三月八日的声明，对于这些战俘的犯罪行为，本应科以应得之惩罚。但朝中方面鉴于他们均系执行上级命令，尚非策划和发动细菌战的主要负责者，并且他们于犯罪后又能坦白认罪，决定对他们从宽处理，并把他们全部遣返。这一行动再度体现了朝中方面的人道主义的宽大精神。
    上述种种，都是美国对朝中人民进行绝灭人性的细菌战的铁的事实。这种铁的事实是任何谎言、抵赖的卑劣手段所不能推翻的。
