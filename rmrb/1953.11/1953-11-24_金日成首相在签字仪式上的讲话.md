    Premier Kim Il-sung's Speech at the Signing Ceremony

    Respected Chairman, Dear Premier, Comrades:

    The talks between the government delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China have concluded successfully in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, friendship, encouragement, and trust. We are very pleased to sign the agreed-upon documents today.

    The agreements we are signing today regarding economic and cultural cooperation between Korea and China will further solidify and develop the traditional and unbreakable friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China, expand and strengthen the long-term cooperative relationship between the two countries in the economic and cultural fields, guarantee the vital interests of the peoples of both countries, and at the same time, have great significance in the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world.

    Anticipating the difficulties the Korean people would encounter in restoring and building the post-war people's economy and striving for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland due to the heavy losses suffered during the war, the People's Republic of China decided to grant, without compensation, all materials and funds used to aid the Korean people during the past three years of war to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Furthermore, to provide material and technical assistance urgently needed by the Korean people in restoring the people's economy, it will again grant a huge sum of 8,000 million RMB yuan, as a material guarantee for accelerating the restoration and development of factories, transportation, rural economy, and improving and raising the people's living standards. This will also become a source of strength to inspire us to new victories in the struggle to strengthen our democratic base, which is the foundation for a unified fatherland.

    During the most difficult period for the Korean people, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, dispatched the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their excellent sons and daughters, to give the Korean people flesh-and-blood assistance, enabling us to defeat the American imperialist aggressors who were several times stronger than us. Now, in the period of restoring the people's economy, we have received such great assistance. At the same time, the great Soviet people have given us a huge sum of 1 billion rubles for post-war economic construction, and other people's democratic countries have also given us fraternal internationalist assistance in economic and technical terms.

    I firmly believe that all this assistance will give the Korean people, who are facing the restoration and construction of the people's economy, greater courage and confidence, enabling us to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and strive for victory in the cause of reviving and developing the people's economy and peacefully unifying the fatherland, just as we achieved glorious victory in the war.

    At present, the American rulers and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, failing to learn a serious lesson on the Korean battlefield, disregard the wishes and demands of the people of the world and attempt to delay and undermine the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Shortly after the Korean armistice, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty," attempting to keep American troops stationed in the southern part of the Republic and continue to interfere in Korea's internal affairs. The American rulers are obstructing the convening of the political conference stipulated in the armistice agreement and are arbitrarily hindering the thorough implementation of the repatriation of prisoners of war agreement.

    The Korean people are constantly vigilant against the enemy's above-mentioned conspiracies and, with the support of the Chinese people and the democratic forces of the world led by the great Soviet Union, will further consolidate the victory already won in the Korean armistice and continue to wage a more resolute struggle for the peaceful unification and independence of the fatherland, on the principle of solving the Korean issue by the Korean people themselves without foreign interference, and for the defense of lasting peace in Asia and the world.

    Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese people!

    Long live the great Chinese people and their wise leader, Chairman Mao Zedong!

### 金日成首相在签字仪式上的讲话

专栏：

    金日成首相在签字仪式上的讲话尊敬的主席同志，亲爱的总理同志，诸位同志们：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团和中华人民共和国中央人民政府间的会谈，在双方很谅解、很友好、互相鼓励、互相信任的和谐气氛中顺利结束。今天在已达成协议的协定文件上签字，我们感到非常欣慰。
    今天我们所签订有关朝中两国经济及文化合作的协定，将更加巩固和发展朝中两国人民间传统的、牢不可破的友谊团结，扩大和加强两国间经济及文化方面的长期合作关系，保证两国人民生活上的切身利益，同时在保卫远东及世界和平事业中具有重大意义。
    由于预见到朝鲜人民在恢复、建设战后人民经济和争取祖国和平统一事业中，会因战争中所遭受的惨重损失而遇到困难，所以，中华人民共和国决定将过去三年战争期间用作援助朝鲜人民的一切物资和款项，无偿地赠予朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并为了朝鲜人民在恢复人民经济中所迫切需要的物质和技术上的援助，再次赠送八万亿元人民币的巨款，以便作为加速工厂、交通运输、农村经济各部门恢复和发展的以及改善和提高人民生活的物质保证；这在加强作为统一祖国基础的我国民主基地的斗争中，也将成为鼓舞我们走向新胜利的力量源泉。
    朝鲜人民处于最困难的时期，中国人民，在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，派遣了以自己的优秀儿女所组成的中国人民志愿军，给朝鲜人民以血肉援助，使我们能够战胜比自己强大数倍的美帝国主义侵略者。现今在恢复人民经济时期，又得到这样巨大的援助，同时伟大的苏联人民给我们以十亿卢布巨款，作为战后经济建设之用，其他人民民主国家从经济上、技术上也给我们以兄弟般的国际主义的援助。
    我深信这一切援助对于面临着人民经济恢复建设的朝鲜人民，将予以更大的勇气和信心，使我们能够克服一切困难和障碍，来争取复兴发展人民经济与和平统一祖国事业上的胜利，正如在战争中取得光辉胜利一样。
    目前美国的统治者们和李承晚卖国匪帮，不接受朝鲜战场上的严重教训，不顾全世界人民的愿望和要求，妄图拖延和破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决。朝鲜停战后不久，美国国务卿杜勒斯和李承晚卖国匪帮签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图使美国军队继续留驻在共和国南部，继续干涉朝鲜的内政，美国统治者们阻挠停战协定所规定的政治会议的召开，蛮横地阻碍着遣返战俘协定的彻底执行。
    朝鲜人民对敌人的以上阴谋诡计，时刻以高度的警惕戒备着，并在中国人民以及以伟大苏联为首的全世界民主力量的声援下，更加巩固已获得的朝鲜停战的胜利，在不受外国干涉、朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题的原则上，为争取祖国的和平统一与独立，保卫亚洲及全世界的持久和平，继续进行更坚决的斗争。
    朝中人民的牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    伟大的中国人民及其英明领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
