    The Excellent Tradition of Chinese Painting
    Zheng Zhenduo
    We are weary and bored with the familiar, repetitive, and vulgar ink and wash landscapes, the frail and weak figure paintings of women, and the lifeless flower and bird paintings. The signatures of the painters may differ, but the ordinary and well-worn style is consistently the same. If we believe that these things are sufficient to represent Chinese painting, then our painting tradition is not worth our love.
    But our painting has its excellent traditions, its great and immortal works. Not only does it have them, but it has many, and not only in one era, but continuously throughout more than two thousand years of long history, with constant peaks and surges of prosperity. Judging from the earliest unearthed painting of a beauty from the Warring States period in Changsha, it is an extraordinary beginning. The murals of the Han tomb in Liaoyang are richer in fluid, elegant tones than the stone carvings of the Wu Family Shrine and Xiaotangshan; not only are the colors rich, but the figures and expressions are also full of vitality. From this, it can be inferred how magnificent the large-scale paintings made by Han dynasty painters on palace walls, as described in the "Rhapsody on the Lingguang Palace of Lu," would have been. The master craftsmen of the Three Kingdoms, Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang dynasties constantly left their famous works on the walls of royal palaces, screens, and temples. Although only the titles remain in records, we still feel invigorated when we read them. Judging from the paintings of past dynasties we have seen in the Painting Gallery of the Palace Museum, the development of the painting world since the Jin and Tang dynasties can be clearly understood, and it can also be fully and concretely explained how the excellent tradition of Chinese painting is like the water of the sea and ocean, not only deep and boundless, but also infinitely changing. Gu Kaizhi of the Jin Dynasty's "Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies," "Biographies of Heroic Women," and "Nymph of the Luo River," although the surviving versions are imitations by Song dynasty artists, the essence remains. The grandeur of the structure, the lines as soft as silk and as firm as iron, and the vivid expressions of the figures cannot but be praised as masterpieces of realism. Zhan Ziqian of the Sui Dynasty's "Spring Outing" is the earliest surviving landscape painting; its fresh and rich colors reflect the beauty of the motherland's mountains and rivers like embroidery. The figures are as small as beans, but their movements are all discernible. Although the works of the elder and younger Li generals do not exist, seeing this "original version" allows us to know how the "gold and green landscape" school was so good at capturing the ever-changing scenery of nature and making it eternally new. The "Gold and Green Landscape Palace Pavilion Picture," traditionally attributed to a Tang dynasty artist, is also a good work belonging to this school. Han Huang of the Tang Dynasty's "Literary Gathering" and the anonymous "Silk Fan Ladies" (traditionally Zhou Fang's "Ladies with Fans") are sufficient to represent the exquisite figure paintings of the 8th century, depicting healthy figures with healthy brushstrokes. The latter depicts the bored and listless state of the palace ladies, fully reflecting the cruelty of the feudal rulers' court life. Gu Hongzhong of the Five Dynasties' "The Night Revels of Han Xizai" and Zhou Wenju's "Double Screen Chess Game" possess excellent sketching skills. "The Night Revels of Han Xizai" uses four continuous sections to depict Han Xizai and others drinking, drumming, playing music, and dancing, focusing the audience's attention on Han's drumming hands, on the dancer, and even depicting Han's slight fatigue after the banquet. It not only paints the form, but also the sound. Wei Xian's "Scholar" combines the strengths of landscape, boundary painting, and figure painting into one work. Dong Yuan's "Xiao and Xiang Rivers" depicts the scenery of Jiangnan; deep waters and dense forests, with smoke and clouds emerging, it is truly the scenery of Jiangnan, and cannot be moved elsewhere. Huang Quan's "Precious Birds" is a sketch "exercise," but it shows how faithfully and diligently the author was in pursuing the forms of objects. Such meticulous and powerful flower and bird sketches greatly developed in the Song Dynasty. Zhao Chang, Cui Bai, Liang Shimin, Zhao Ji, Li Di, Li Song, Ma Yuan, Mao Yi, and others, as well as many court paintings without author signatures, all achieved great success in this area. They were good at grasping the animal life observed carefully over a long period of time, and vividly expressing its most
  "picturesque"—that is to say, the most moving—moment of action. Even in a small painting, they devoted all their energy to it, without any slackening in a single stroke. Like Ma Yuan's "Plum Tree, Rock, and Mandarin Ducks," such a narrow picture has a sense of endless vastness; seven or eight wild ducks swim on the water, some floating leisurely, some chasing each other with flapping wings, some half-submerged in the water foraging for food, and some turning their necks as if calling to their companions. With just a few strokes, all the various states are fully present. Li Gonglin's "Herding" depicts more than a thousand horses and more than a hundred people, crowded together but not at all cramped, the atmosphere is grand enough. Mi Youren's "Spectacular View of Xiao and Xiang Rivers" and Wang Ximeng's "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" have completely different styles, but they achieve the same goal of expressing the magnificence of nature. The former splashes ink like flying, and viewing it is like walking into a rainy Jiangnan village. The latter meticulously depicts mountains, rivers, bridges, houses, and figures, with brush tips as fine as hairs; the birds flying in the sky, like small black dots, can also be seen in different flying postures. Zhang Zeduan's "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" is a great masterpiece of realism. From the countryside to the city, all kinds of goods are displayed, and all kinds of states are present, it is the best genre painting. The hard work of the laborers and the banquets in the restaurants of the leisurely can also reflect the social reality and class differences of the time. Its significance is not only in being a true historical record of the time like "The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor". This monumental work has long been hidden, and the ones that are passed down are all imitations. Today, we are finally able to see its "true face". The landscape paintings of the Zhao Boju and Bosu brothers inherited Zhan Ziqian's tradition and carried it forward. Boju's "Autumn Colors of Rivers and Mountains" has mature brushwork and a vigorous style. Bosu's "Ten Thousand Pines and Golden Palace" is a bold creation, unprecedented. Among ten thousand verdant pines, several golden palace ridges are revealed; white cranes fly far away, and azure birds gather, creating a sense of profound vastness. Ma Yuan's "Water Album" uses ten different paintings to depict the turbulent states of rivers, lakes, and seas under different light, so realistically expressing the most elusive "water." Just looking at how his lines change in a myriad of ways is enough for us to learn a lot. His "Treading Song" depicts several farmers walking and dancing, expressing the self-entertainment of the laborers after their hard work. Zhao Fu's "Ten Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" uses only ink to depict magnificent mountains and rivers, without feeling lengthy, but rather fearing that it will end too soon. Liang Kai created the "reduced brush" style of painting, with reduced brushstrokes but deeper meaning. Zhao Mengjian's "Ink Orchid" is graceful and refined, opening the way for the style of the Yuan dynasty. The Yuan dynasty painters created works with dry ink and withered brushstrokes, and the most popular themes were wild waters and barren mountains, withered trees and bamboo, and small pavilions and thatched cottages. Huang Gongwang's landscapes are desolate, Wu Zhen's scenery is unrestrained, Wang Meng's forests and springs are dense, and lone trees are the main focus. Ni Zan's paintings do not include a single figure, and Wang Mian's plum blossoms have a stubborn meaning of looking at the sky with disdain. However, the traditional painting style of the Song Dynasty painting academy still existed. Zhao Mengfu, Ren Renfa, and Wang Yuan are its representatives. Their figures, horses, flowers, and birds inherited the best traditions of the Tang and Song dynasties. The painting world of the Ming Dynasty had a variety of styles. There were successors to the Song Dynasty court style of painting such as Dai Jin, Lu Ji, and Zhang Lu, as well as those who carried forward the styles of the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty (Huang, Wu, Ni, Wang) such as Shen Zhou and Wen Bi. Qiu Ying's brushstrokes progressed from imitation to creation, always being rich, exquisite, and tireless. Xu Wei, Chen Daofu, and Zhou Zhimian's flower paintings created a bold and unrestrained style, not only resembling the form, but also capturing the lively life. Xu Wei's "Searching for Poetry on a Donkey's Back" depicts the legs of a running donkey with just a few strokes, but they are very powerful, and it seems that the sound of hooves hitting the ground can still be heard. Xiang Shengmo's "Great Tree Howling in the Wind" depicts the setting sun on the mountain, a vast and solitary person, and a great tree standing together in the evening wind, with an unyielding spirit. The figure paintings of Zeng Jing, Cui Zizhong, and Chen Hongshou each have different personalities. Chen Hongshou was especially able to express solitary and unyielding character with solitary and unyielding brushstrokes. He wanted to break through constraints and open up a new path. Lan Ying's landscape paintings maintained a refined "Northern School" style. Gong Xian lived in Qingliang Mountain in Nanjing, and did not leave his house. The works made by him as the leader of the "Eight Masters of Jinling" have a myriad of forms. His landscape paintings are thickly painted, without feeling cumbersome, and seeing them cannot help but evoke nostalgia for the motherland's mountains and rivers. Bada Shanren's paintings are stubborn, revealing unspoken meaning in "simplicity." Daoji's paintings are dripping with ink, showing deep skill in roughness. Hongren's works are seemingly withered but actually clear and moist, and what Kun Can writes is seemingly dry and astringent but actually has infinite depth. Xiao Yuncong does not belong to any particular school, taking the essence and applying it broadly, sketching directly from nature, receiving inspiration directly from nature. Mei Qing wrote about Mount Huangshan, with white clouds filling the air and pine waves surging, its creative power and the power of nature are connected in breath and pulse. In this era of great change, it is very natural to produce painters with national integrity. Later, Yu Zhiding's figure paintings uniquely passed on the secret of "portraiture," Wu Li's landscape paintings captured the interest of real mountains and real waters; Yun Shouping's flower paintings had unparalleled fresh colors; his "Peach Blossoms" seemed to be smiling and talking, making these easily fleeting flowers immortal on the canvas. During the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong periods, many painters emerged. Yuan Jiang and Yuan Yao, uncle and nephew, revived the interrupted "boundary painting," which is particularly pleasing to us. The works of "court painting" writers such as Yan Hongzi and Luo Fuzeng also have considerable skill. There were also the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou," who lived in Yangzhou, the economic center of Jiangnan at the time, broke away from the traditional neatness and refinement of "court painting," and created a style with a strong personality, like comets producing a different kind of light in the painting world. Jin Nong's plum blossoms are chiseled brushstroke by brushstroke, with unique postures. Li Shan's sketches are bold and vigorous, with leaping vitality. Zheng Xie's ink bamboo has strong joints soaring into the sky, refusing to yield. Luo Ping's landscapes, flowers, and birds have a dangerous artistic conception. Huang Shen's figures, flowers, and fruits have flying brushstrokes. The outstanding Hua Yan was a versatile painter, especially skilled in flower and bird paintings. His flowers and birds were written by directly observing the forms of objects, "taking nature as a teacher." The several squirrels in "Mountain Rat Pecking Chestnuts" are lively and lifelike; the softness of the fur and the lightness and agility of the body seem to give off warmth to the touch. After the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods, there were no great writers, and it seemed lonely. However, the "Visiting Stele Picture" written by the archaeologist Huang Yi opened up a unique path in landscape painting. The landscapes and figures of Qian Du, Gai Qi, and Fei Danxu deviated from the bold and unrestrained and tended to be meticulous, with a relatively fresh style. The flower paintings of Zhao Zhiqian, Ren Xiong, Ren Yi, and Wu Changshuo inherited the ancient realistic tradition and opened up a rough style, still being works with life and personality.
    The above is only a description based on the paintings displayed in the Painting Gallery: The excellent tradition of Chinese painting spanning more than two thousand years is diverse, with new styles and new creations appearing from time to time. It is by no means monotonous, but constantly has a fresh style. Its development path is extraordinary. Outstanding painters have appeared in every era, sometimes in large groups, and sometimes like a few scattered stars after dawn. They have successively enriched our painting history with their living works, making it a magnificent sight of "a hundred flowers blooming." "There are flowers that never fade in all four seasons, and there are evergreen grasses in all eight festivals," this sentence is enough to describe the course of development of our painting.
    Within the diverse styles, there are common national characteristics. Whether it is a work of Jin, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, or Qing, it can be recognized at a glance as Chinese painting. Whether it is meticulous, bold, neat, or simple; whether it is thousands of peaks and ten thousand trees, dense and layered; whether it is a grass pavilion and distant mountains, a few strokes; whether it is golden and brilliant, thousands of doors and households; whether it is dripping with ink, only writing a corner of a mountain or the edge of a water; whether it is a group of birds pecking for food or a lone horse neighing; whether it is bamboo leaves scattered or plum branches strong, it can be recognized at a glance as Chinese painting. At the same time, Chinese painters skillfully used soft-tipped brushes, absorbent paper, and fine silk, and were able to capture the ever-changing human emotions and physical states, concentrate their characteristics, and prominently express those characteristics, making them eternal and making them always new. All the great painters are hardworking scholars; their achievements are by no means achieved overnight. The famous saying "nine drafts and one completion" (that is, drafting nine times, and only completing it on the tenth time) proves that perfect paintings are by no means entirely based on accidental inspiration and completed in one stroke. Long-term technical practice and long-term observation of human emotions and physical states, combining one's own life with the life of the object being depicted, will naturally create realistic works with permanent life. There will be no crash courses in the art department; the so-called genius includes nine parts hard work.
    Although what is displayed in the Painting Gallery is not a comprehensive introduction to Chinese painting, and the works of many great painters have not yet been collected, it is still possible to see its general evolution. The ancient paintings originally collected in the Palace Museum were stolen and transported away by the reactionaries before liberation; today, almost all the paintings displayed here were collected by us after liberation. Every bit is the harvest of hard work. Before this, the vast majority of people simply had no opportunity to approach this most excellent department of the art of the motherland—painting. The Painting Gallery for the first time systematically and systematically displayed Chinese paintings that we could collect according to their historical evolution. It not only provides "weeding through the old to bring forth the new" materials for painters who want to absorb the excellent national artistic traditions today, but also allows the vast majority of people to have the opportunity to approach and appreciate the excellent art of the motherland, thereby generating the effect of patriotic education. Its significance is important. The future of the Chinese "Gallery" built on this relatively solid foundation is bright, and its role and effect are huge. In the past, it was from nothing to something, and in the future it will be from small to large. However, this still depends on the assistance and efforts of the broad masses of the people to gradually realize it.

    中国绘画的优秀传统
    郑振铎
    我们看熟了陈陈相因、千篇一律的庸俗的水墨山水画，弱不禁风的仕女画，生意索然的花鸟画，觉得腻烦，觉得单调、无聊。画家的署名也许不同，那平凡烂熟的风调却是一贯无殊。假如我们相信那些东西就足以代表中国的绘画，那末我们绘画方面的传统便不怎样值得我们热爱了。
    但我们的绘画是有其优秀的传统的，有其伟大的不朽的作品的。不仅有，而且很多，不仅某一个时代有，而且绵绵不绝的经历二千多年的悠久历史，不断的有奇峰突起，高潮汹涌的繁盛场面出现。就现存于世的最早一幅长沙出土的战国时代的美女画来看，就是不平凡的开端。辽阳汉墓的壁画，比之武氏祠、孝堂山诸石刻画象，更富于流动、俊逸的调子；不仅色彩丰富，人物的形象和神情也虎虎有生气。这就可推想，汉代画家们在宫殿墙壁上所作的巨幅的绘画，像“鲁灵光殿赋”所叙的，会是怎样的壮丽弘伟。三国六朝隋唐的钜匠们不断的在皇家的宫殿里和屏风上，在庙宇的墙堵上，留下他们的有名的剧迹。虽只是空存其目于记载里，但我们读起来还觉得眉飞色舞。就我们在故宫博物院绘画馆所见的历代绘画而论，晋唐以来的画坛的发展是可以明白的知道，而且也可以充分的具体的说明中国绘画的优秀传统是怎样的像大海大洋的水似的，不仅深远无垠，而且变幻无穷。晋顾恺之的“女史箴图”“列女图”和“洛神赋图”，今存者虽为宋人摹本，而典型犹在，结构的壮阔，线条的柔如细丝，刚如铁线，人物神态的顾盼如生，不能不赞叹其为现实主义的杰作。隋展子虔的“游春图”，是今存的最早的一幅山水画；那新艳繁富的色彩，反映出祖国山川的锦绣般的可爱。人物小如豆点，而动态一一可指。大小李将军的作品虽然不存于世，见了这个“祖本”，就可以知道“金碧山水”的一派是如何的善于捉住大自然的瞬息万变的景色而使之万古常新。相传为唐人所作的“金碧山水殿阁图”，也是属于这一派里的好的作品。唐韩滉的“文苑图”，无名氏的“纨扇仕女图”（传即周昉的“挥扇仕女图”）足以代表第八世纪的精美的人物画，以健康的笔调，写出健康的人物。后者描写宫女们的倦绣无聊的情态，十足的反映出封建统治者的宫庭生活的惨酷来。五代顾闳中的“韩熙载夜宴图”，周文矩的“重屏会棊图”，写生技巧颇为佳妙。“韩熙载夜宴图”以连续四节的篇幅，写韩熙载与众人的喧饮，击鼓，奏乐，跳舞，写众客的视线集中于韩的击鼓的手上，集中于舞者的身上，以至写宴散后韩的微现倦容，不仅绘形，而且绘声。卫贤的“高士图”集山水、界画、人物的所长于一幅中。董源的“潇湘图”写江南山水；水深林密，烟云出没，硬是江南风景，不得移之他地。黄筌的“珍禽图”，是一幅写生的“习作”，却表现出作者是如何忠实而辛勤的在追摹物态。像这样的细致有力的花鸟写生，在宋代大为发展。赵昌、崔白、梁师闵、赵佶、李迪、李嵩、马远、毛益等人的作品，以及许多无作者署名的院画，在这方面都得到很大的成功。他们善于把握住经过仔细的长期的观察的动物生活，而活泼生动的表现出其最
  “入画”—也就是说，最动人的—一瞬间的动态。就是小小的一幅，他们也以全力赴之，一笔不懈。像马远的“梅石溪凫图”，在那样窄小的画面上，却具有无穷的旷阔之感；七八只野凫在水面上游着，或安闲浮泛着，或拍拍的相追逐着，或半身没水觅食，或回颈似在呼侣。以寥寥的几笔，便备具众态。李公麟的“牧放图”，写马在千匹以上，写人在百数以上，拥拥挤挤，却毫不显得局促，那气象是够壮伟的。米友仁的“潇湘奇观图”和王希孟的“千里江山图”，风格截然不同，而表现大自然的壮阔的景色，却异曲同工。前者泼墨如飞，观之仿佛走入多雨的江乡。后者细细的描写山川、桥梁、屋宇、人物，笔尖像毫发似的细密；天上群飞的鸟，像小黑点似的，却也看得出不同的飞翔姿态。张择端的“清明上河图”是现实主义的大杰作。从乡村到城市，百货俱陈，百态俱备，是最好的一幅风俗画。劳动者辛勤操作，有闲者酒楼欢宴，也可以表现出当时的社会现实，阶级差别。其意义的重大，固不仅仅在于像“东京梦华录”似的为当时的真实的历史记录而已。这卷钜作，久已隐去，相传的都是仿本，今日才得见到“庐山真面目”。赵伯驹、伯骕兄弟的山水画，继承了展子虔的传统而发扬光大。伯驹的“江山秋色图”，笔力老到，风格苍劲。伯骕的“万松金阙图”，则大胆创作，前无古人。于苍松万棵之中，露出若干金色的殿脊；白鹤远飞，青鸟群集，有深远苍茫之感。马远的“水图”，以不同的十幅，写江、河、湖、海的水在不同的光线之下的动荡之态，把最不可捉摸的“水”，如此的真实的表现出来。单看他的线条如何变幻百出，已足以让我们学到不少东西。他的“踏歌图”，几个农人在且走且舞，表现了劳动者在辛勤劳作之后的自娱。赵芾的“江山万里图”，纯以水墨，描写壮阔的山川，不见其冗长，却恐其欲尽。梁楷创作了“减笔”的画风，笔减而意深。赵孟坚的“墨兰图”，娟秀清高，已开启了元人的画格。元代画家们创作了干墨枯笔的作品，题材也以野水荒山，枯木竹石，小亭茅舍为最流行。黄公望的山水苍凉，吴镇的景色旷逸，王蒙的林泉绵密，孤树为主。倪瓒的画，不着一个人物，王冕的梅花，有白眼看天的倔强之意。但传统的宋画院的画风，也还存在着。赵孟頫、任仁发、王渊，是其代表。他们的人马花鸟继承着最好的唐、宋人的传统。明代的画坛具有多种多样的风格。有戴进、吕纪、张路等的宋院体画的继承者，也有沈周、文璧等的元四家（黄、吴、倪、王）作风的发扬光大者。仇英的笔调，由摹拟而进到创造，始终是富丽精工，笔笔不懈的。徐渭、陈道复、周之冕的花卉画，创造了泼辣豪纵的调子，不仅形似，且还捉住了活泼泼的生命。徐渭的“驴背寻诗图”，写那在跑着的驴腿，只是几笔出之，却很有力量，似还听得出踏地的蹄声。项圣谟的“大树风号图”，夕阳在山，苍茫独立的人，和大树一同在晚风中屹立着，有不屈服的气概。曾鲸、崔子忠、陈洪绶的人物画，各有不同的个性。陈洪绶尤能以孤傲倔强的笔调，写出孤傲倔强的性格。他是想突破拘束，独辟一个新的蹊径的。蓝瑛的山水画维持着精致的“北派”风格。龚贤居南京清凉山，闭户不出。以他为首的“金陵八家”所作，气象万千。他的山水画，浓浓涂抹，不见其繁，见之，不由得不对祖国山河引起留恋。八大山人的画是拗强的，于“简”中见出不言之意。道济的画是墨汁淋漓的，于粗豪里显出深厚的功力。弘仁之作是似枯而实清润的，髡残所写，是似干涩而实具无穷的深远的。萧云从不名一家，取精用弘，是对景写生，直接从大自然受到感召的。梅清写黄山，白云弥蒙，松涛澎湃，其创作的魄力与大自然的威力是呼吸、脉搏相通的。在这个大变动的时代，产生出有民族气节的画家是很自然的。稍后，禹之鼎的人物画，独传“写真”之秘，吴历的山水画，得真山真水之趣；恽寿平的花卉画，色调清新绝伦；他的“桃花”，欲笑语，把这容易飘零的花朵，永生在画幅之上了。康熙、雍正、乾隆之间，画家辈出。袁江、袁曜叔侄，复活了中断的“界画”画，特别为我们所欣喜。严宏滋、罗福?等“院画”作家的所作，功夫也相当深厚。另有“扬州八怪”，居住于为当时江南经济中心的扬州，摆脱了“院画”的工整精致的传统，独创出个性强烈的作风，像彗星似的在画坛产生异样的光芒。金农的梅花是笔笔巉削，独具姿态。李鱓的写生，纵笔挥毫，生机跳跃。郑爕的墨竹，劲节凌霄，不甘屈服。罗聘的山水、花鸟，意境险峻。黄慎的人物、花果，笔墨飞动。杰出的华岩，他是一个全材的画人，尤擅长于花鸟画。他的花鸟，是直接观察物态而写下的，是“以造化为师”的。“山鼠啄栗图”里的几只松鼠，活跃如生；毛的柔和，身体的轻巧灵活，仿佛抚之会有温热透出。嘉道以后，大作家是没有了，显得寂寞。但考古学者黄易所写的“访碑图”，在山水画里独辟蹊径。钱杜、改琦、费丹旭的山水、人物，脱离了豪纵而倾向于工致，格调是比较清新的。赵之谦、任熊、任颐、吴昌硕的花卉画，继承古代写实的传统，而别启粗豪的风格，仍是有生命，有个性的作品。
    以上只是就绘画馆所陈列的画幅而说明：我国绘画的绵绵不绝的二千多年间的优秀传统是多种多样的，时时有新的作风，新的创造出现，决不是单调的，而是不断的有清新格调的。它的发展的历程是不平凡的。杰出的画家，在各时代都有出现，有时是一大群，有时是像曙后孤星似的零零落落的几个。他们以其有生命的作品，陆续丰富了我们的绘画史，使其成为“百花齐放”的钜观。“四时有不谢之花，八节有长春之草，”这句话足以形容我们绘画的发展的途程。
    在多种多样的风格里，却有共同的民族特点。不论是晋，是隋，是唐，是宋，是元，是明，是清的作品，一望即知，那是中国画。不论是细密的、粗豪的、工致的、简率的；不论是千峰万树，密密重重；不论是草亭远山，寥寥数笔；不论是金碧辉煌，千门万户；不论是水墨淋漓，只写山之一角，水之一涯；不论是群鸟啄食，独马嘶鸣；不论是竹叶披离，梅枝刚劲，一望即知，那是中国画。同时中国的画家们，纯熟地使用了柔锋的毛笔，容易吸水的纸和细密的绢，而能够把捉住瞬息万变的人情物态，集中其特点，突出的把那些特点表现出来，使之永生，使之常新。所有的伟大的画家们，都是辛勤的苦学者；他们的成就，决不是一朝一夕之功。所谓“九朽一罢”的名言，（就是说，起稿九次，到了第十次才画成。）就可证明完美的画幅决不是完全凭借偶然的兴会，一挥即就的。长时期的技术练习，长时期的人情物态的观察，使自己的生命，和描写对象的生命结合在一起，那自然就会创作出有永久的生命的现实主义的作品了。在艺术部门里是不会有速成科的；所谓天才，就包含着九分的苦工在内。
    绘画馆所陈列的虽然不是中国绘画的全面介绍，有许多大画家的作品还没有收集到，但总还能看出其一般的演变的状况来。故宫博物院原藏的古画，被反动派在解放前盗运一空；今天，凡在这里陈列的画幅，几乎都是解放以后，我们所收集到的。一点一滴，都是辛勤耕耘的收获。在这以前，广大人民简直无法有接近这祖国艺术里最优秀的一个部门——绘画——的机会。绘画馆第一次有组织、有系统的把我们所可能收集到的中国绘画按照其历史演变的程序陈列出来。不仅供给今日要吸取优秀的民族艺术传统的画家们的“推陈出新”的资料，且让广大人民有接近欣赏祖国的优秀艺术的可能，从而发生爱国主义教育的效果。那意义是重大的。在这个比较稳固的基础上建立起来的中国“画廊”，其前途是光明的，其作用与效果是巨大的。过去是从无到有，今后是从小到大。可是这还要依靠广大人民的协助与努力，才能使它逐步的实现。
