　　The Shameful Policy of the United States Using Prisoners of War as a Tool of the "Cold War"
　　Cui Qi
　　The prisoner of war explanation work in Dongchang-ri, Korea, which the world is watching, has recently fallen into a serious state of stagnation again due to the escalating sabotage by the US side. All peace-loving people who long for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue are expressing their concern about this situation and their great indignation at the US's frenzied atrocities and despicable means to undermine the explanation work. However, those American executioners who massacre prisoners of war and American conspirators who detain prisoners of war are sneering in the dark corners. While chanting the mantra that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's work is "about to collapse," they shamelessly and absurdly proclaim their crimes as a "victory" for the American "Cold War."
　　According to the "Terms of Reference," the explanation work for prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated should have started no later than September 25. However, from the beginning, the US side used the excuse of technical difficulties to delay the construction of the tents necessary for the explanation work. People still remember that when the American aggressors came to Korea to kill and set fires from afar, they boasted about the superiority of American weapons and technology, but when they were asked to build some simple tents to facilitate the repatriation of prisoners of war as stipulated in the armistice agreement, they suddenly admitted their incompetence. How can this phenomenon be explained? An October 5th dispatch from the Associated Press can answer: "The Allied side seems to have defeated the Communist side today... The Allied side has apparently delayed the Communist side's attempt to persuade prisoners of war to return home for another four weeks (originally only delayed for one week)." It can be seen that the US side is determined to disrupt the explanation work, with the aim of undermining it, forcibly detaining prisoners of war, maintaining the unstable state of the Korean armistice, and even undermining the armistice. Otherwise, why would they call the delay in the start of the explanation work their own "victory"?
　　Sure enough, when the explanation work finally started under our insistence and the pressure of world opinion, the US side's sabotage activities became even more rampant. The US side used a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents and bandits, systematically sent to the prisoner of war camps, to continue to implement concentration camp-style terrorist rule against our captured personnel who had already been subjected to long-term inhuman torture in Geoje Island and other places. Our captured personnel who demanded repatriation were hung up, trampled to death, skinned, had their hearts dug out, chopped into pieces, and doused with gasoline and burned by the special agent elements. The American executioners brutally killed prisoner of war Zhang Zilong, and then took heinous measures to eliminate the evidence of the crime, crushing the body, burning it to ashes in the stove, and washing it away in the ditch. These appalling crimes are truly unprecedented. The prisoner of war camps controlled by US special agents have become a world of demons. Prisoners of war can only desperately try to escape the clutches of the special agents. In fact, every one of our returning personnel escaped at the risk of their lives. And because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission failed to take effective measures in accordance with the "Terms of Reference," the ferocity of the US special agents is increasing day by day. They also openly disrupt the explanation work and openly beat prisoners of war who demand repatriation in front of the neutral country personnel. These facts written in blood have long been exposed to the world, but the American professional liars still insist that the prisoners of war are "refusing repatriation." An unnamed senior official of the US State Department even publicly described the deadlock in the repatriation work as America's "greatest propaganda victory—probably the biggest victory we have achieved in the Korean War."
　　This absurd propaganda by the United States is permeated with the bloody breath of the American executioners and the smell of gasoline burning the corpses of prisoners of war! In order to win its "Cold War," the American war group has actually used the blood and lives of prisoners of war as its stake. Is there anything more brutal in the world or in history!
　　People know that imperialism is always arrogant and unreasonable; this is not surprising. But now, the American aggressors have been beaten bloody on the Korean battlefield, but they still want to pretend to be "heroes" "psychologically." This is not only arrogant, but also cowardly and rogue! Can the US's mad slaughter of those unarmed prisoners of war save its increasingly collapsing imperialist prestige?
　　In fact, this shameful "Cold War" policy of the United States has caused it a great political failure. Although the American propaganda machine is happily calculating the percentage of how many prisoners of war "refuse repatriation" every day, and shamelessly proves that it seems that most prisoners of war support the American way of life, who does not see that the prisoner of war camps controlled by US special agents today are a microcosm of the American way of life? There, the special agents have the freedom to kill, and the prisoners of war only have the "freedom" to be killed or detained as a sacrifice for the American "Cold War." There, all justice and righteousness, humanity and human rights, are replaced by special agent violence and submerged by the arrogance of fascism. At the same time, who does not see that the US's reckless actions on the Korean prisoner of war issue today are also a concentrated reflection of the American way of life in American diplomacy? There, the United States tramples the world's recognized international law underfoot, and destroys the solemn agreement of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" signed by both parties. The United States has shown American-style arrogance and great disrespect to neutral countries. There, the United States regards social scum, special agent bandits as the main means of politics and diplomacy. All of these are a grand performance of the extremely dark, dirty, ugly, and brutal American way of life, and are the most vivid proof of America's increasingly degenerate and vulgar political and diplomatic stance. The more the people of the world see this American farce, the more thoroughly the American deceptive propaganda will go bankrupt.
　　The growing world peace force that demands the easing of international tensions will absolutely not allow the American aggressors to use prisoners of war as a "Cold War" tool to obstruct and undermine the repatriation of Korean prisoners of war. The so-called "victory" of the United States in abusing and forcibly detaining prisoners of war has been met with endless curses and utter hatred from all people with a little human dignity, and only ghosts and monsters will cheer for it. The British magazine "The Economist" also wrote on October 31: "It is short-sighted to be happy that the entire explanation work is tending to stall. Only for Syngman Rhee—and perhaps Chiang Kai-shek—is there a real reason to be happy." The American "Saturday Evening Post" also had to admit that this approach of the United States on the prisoner of war issue will sweep away its prestige in Asia.
　　No matter how the American blood-drinking group orders its propaganda machine to crank up and tout its "Cold War" victory song, what it will hear will be the death knell resounding throughout the world, announcing the most shameful failure of the United States politically and morally.

### 美国以战俘作为“冷战”工具的可耻政策

　　美国以战俘作为“冷战”工具的可耻政策
    崔  奇
    世界瞩目的朝鲜东场里战俘解释工作，由于美方变本加厉的破坏，最近又陷于严重的停顿状态。一切爱好和平的、渴望和平解决朝鲜问题的人们，无不对这种情况表示忧虑，而对美方破坏解释工作的疯狂暴行和卑鄙手段表示极大的愤怒。但是，那些屠杀战俘的美国刽子手和扣留战俘的美国阴谋家们，却在黑暗的角落里狞笑。他们一边念诵着中立国遣返委员会的工作“即将垮台”的咒语，一边竟恬不知耻地荒谬绝伦地把他们的罪行宣扬为美国“冷战”的“胜利”。
    按照“职权范围”规定，对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作，至迟应在九月二十五日就要开始进行。但美方一开头就借口技术困难，迟迟不肯修建为解释工作所必需的帐篷。人们都还记得，当美国侵略者不远万里到朝鲜来杀人放火的时候，他们曾把美国武器与技术优越夸耀得天花乱坠，可是当今天要美国修建一些简单的帐篷以利于停战协定所规定的战俘遣返工作的时候，他们却突然自认低能了。这种现象作何解释呢？美联社十月五日的电讯可以回答：“联军方面今天似乎已经战胜共方。……联军显然已使共方说服战俘回家事又延迟了四星期开始（本来只延迟一星期）”。可见美方对于解释工作，根本就是决心捣乱的，目的是在破坏解释工作，强迫扣留战俘，以保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，甚至破坏停战，否则为什么他们竟把拖延解释工作开始的时间称为自己的“胜利”呢？
    果然，当解释工作在我方坚持下和世界舆论压力下终于开始以后，美方的破坏活动就更加猖狂了。美方利用其有计划地派到战俘营的大批蒋李特务匪徒，对那些已经在巨济岛等地受到长期非人折磨的我方被俘人员，继续实行集中营式的恐怖统治。要求遣返的我方被俘人员，竟被特务分子吊打，踩死，剥皮，挖心，剁成肉段，浇上汽油燃烧。美方刽子手把战俘张子龙惨杀了，又采取万恶不赦的手段来消灭罪迹，把尸体捣碎，放在灶里烧成灰烬，倒在水沟里冲走。这些令人发指的罪行真是旷古未闻的，美方特务控制下的战俘营已成为魔鬼世界了。战俘要逃出特务魔掌，只有拚命；事实上每一个我方归来人员都是冒着生命危险逃出来的。而由于中立国遣返委员会未能按照“职权范围”采取有效措施，美方特务的凶焰日益高涨，在解释工作进行时也公开捣乱，并在中立国人员面前当场毒打要求遣返的战俘。这些血写的事实早已大白于世，美国的职业说谎家却还硬说是战俘“拒绝遣返”。一个不肯发表姓名的美国国务院高级官员甚至公然把遣返工作的僵局，说成是美国“最伟大的宣传胜利——很可能就是我们在朝鲜战争中取得的最大胜利”。
    美国这种荒谬的宣传，是浸透了美国刽子手身上的血腥气息的，是浸透了烧焦战俘尸体的汽油味的！美国战争集团为了赢得它的“冷战”，竟把战俘的鲜血和生命，当成它的赌注了。世界上，历史上，难道还有比这更残暴的事情吗！
    人们知道，帝国主义在任何时候总是蛮横无理的；这是不足为奇的。而如今，美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上被打得头破血流，却还要在“心理上”把自己装成“英雄”。这就不仅是蛮横，而且是卑怯和无赖！难道美国疯狂屠杀那些手无寸铁的战俘就能挽救其日益垮台的帝国主义威风吗？
    事实上，美国这种可耻的“冷战”政策，已使它在政治上遭到极大的失败。尽管美国的宣传机器天天在得意地计算着多少战俘“拒绝遣返”的百分比，并丝毫不知羞耻地证明说仿佛大多数战俘都是拥护美国生活方式的，但是谁不看见，今天在美方特务控制下的战俘营不就是美国生活方式的缩影吗？在那儿，特务有杀人的自由，战俘则只有充当美国“冷战”的牺牲品而被杀或被扣留的“自由”。在那儿，一切公理和正义，人道和人权，都被特务暴力所代替，被法西斯的气焰所淹没了。同时，谁不看见，今天美国在朝鲜战俘问题上的胡作非为，不也正是美国生活方式在美国外交上的集中反映吗？在那儿，美国把世界公认的国际公法践踏在脚下，把双方签字的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的庄严协议，破坏无遗。美国对中立国则表现了美国式的盛气凌人和极大的不尊重。在那儿，美国把社会渣滓特务匪徒当成了政治和外交的主要手段。所有这些都是极其黑暗、肮脏、丑恶和残暴的美国生活方式的一次大表演，都是美国在政治上和外交上日趋堕落和下流的最生动的证明。全世界人民看到的这种美国丑剧越多，美国的欺骗宣传就会更加彻底破产了。
    日益壮大的要求缓和国际紧张局势的世界和平力量，绝对不容许美国侵略者以战俘作为“冷战”工具，阻挠和破坏朝鲜战俘的遣返工作。美国虐杀战俘和强迫扣留战俘的所谓“胜利”，遭到了一切稍有人类自尊的人们的无穷咒骂和彻骨憎恨，只有鬼魅魍魉才会对它喝采。英国《经济学家》周刊也于十月三十一日写道：“如果由于整个解释工作有陷于停顿的趋势而感到高兴，那是短视的。只有对于李承晚——也许还有蒋介石——来说，才有感到高兴的真正原因。”美国《星期六晚邮报》也不得不承认，美国在战俘问题上的这种做法，将使它在亚洲的威信扫地。
    不论美国喝血集团怎样命令它的宣传机器开足马力鼓吹自己的“冷战”凯歌，但是它所听到的将是响彻全世界的宣告美国在政治上和道义上遭到最可耻失败的丧钟。
