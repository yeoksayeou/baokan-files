    Improving and Strengthening Urban Construction Work
    With the gradual development of national industrial construction, China's emerging industrial cities are being established or will be established in new industrial bases rich in mineral resources; several original large cities and important industrial cities are also expanding as the proportion of industrial construction increases. The major task of how to improve and strengthen urban construction work and plan the construction of new cities and the reconstruction of old cities is now urgently placed before us and has become an important issue in the current economic construction.
    In the past four years, we have not only generally restored and maintained the original municipal facilities, but also begun to improve the material and cultural life of urban workers on the basis of developing production. Especially in large cities, the living conditions of workers have been significantly improved. According to statistics from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai alone, the worker housing built in 1953 reached 1.88 million square meters (if averaged at 15 square meters per room, it would be more than 125,300 rooms). Thanks to the state's large investment in urban construction, various regions have done a lot in urban public utilities and cultural and educational construction, which has played a supporting role in industrial construction and production undertakings, and has also considerably improved the sanitary conditions, transportation conditions, and material and cultural life of the workers in these cities.
    However, it should also be pointed out that this work cannot fully meet the needs of urban workers' lives, and this situation may continue for a considerable period of time in the future. On the one hand, there are many unreasonable phenomena left over in cities by the old society for a long time, which cannot be completely changed in a short period of time, and more importantly, in the early stage of national construction, our financial strength, technical conditions, and urban construction experience are not yet able to quickly carry out major transformations of the old large cities. Even some major industrial cities can only be built with emphasis and step by step. Only on the basis of ensuring the continuous development of national industry can our urban construction gradually develop.
    At present, some comrades in some areas do not have a sufficient understanding of this point, and they show a tendency of impatience and adventurism, and decentralization in urban construction work. When preparing the basic construction plan for urban public utilities, many cities only consider the needs and do not consider the possible conditions of the country's economic situation and technical strength, and attempt to make everything flourish and envision that everything will be renewed in a short period of time. As a result, some cities have too many projects going on at the same time, and the design and construction forces cannot keep up, and the quality of all the projects is very low. Some cities, when allocating urban construction investment, do not concentrate their main efforts on ensuring industrial production and improving the welfare of the working people's key projects, but rather disperse investment and lack focus, resulting in a lot of money being spent with little effect. Some cities also do not pay attention to giving full play to the potential power of existing public utility equipment, and do not pay attention to the business management and maintenance work of enterprises, but are only busy adding new equipment. All of these have caused waste of national construction funds and the normal progress of urban construction work. In addition, some places have not seriously grasped the urban planning work, and lack overall layout and unified leadership for urban development, so that the construction areas of factories, residences, transportation, and cultural and educational construction are not reasonably arranged. In some places, residential buildings are built in industrial areas, and factories are built in residential areas; the drainage from upstream factories affects the water supply of downstream factories and residents; and even chaotic phenomena such as building before demolition and demolition after construction occur. If this blind and decentralized chaotic situation continues to develop, it will increase the great difficulty of future reconstruction of old cities.
    In order to adapt to the needs of large-scale construction undertakings, we must quickly improve and strengthen urban construction work and overcome the current chaotic phenomena such as blindness and decentralization in urban construction. To this end, the following major issues need to be resolved first:
    First, we must conscientiously implement the national policy of "focusing on construction and advancing steadily," and use urban construction investment primarily in cities with a large proportion of industrial construction. As for general small and medium-sized cities with a small proportion of industry, a policy of temporary maintenance should be adopted during the first five-year plan period, and basic construction will generally no longer be expanded. The same is true for specific construction projects, which should be carried out with emphasis to ensure that urban construction serves the direction of industry, production, and the working people. At present, urban construction investment should be mainly used in sewers and improving urban environmental sanitation and developing urban transportation (such as roads and vehicles). The most important projects should be determined according to the overall urban plan and the possibilities of economic and technical conditions, distinguishing between importance and urgency, and opposing the practice of making everything flourish. Before the overall urban plan is determined, do not rush to start large-scale construction. Important projects that are not fully guaranteed should be handled with caution to avoid blind advancement and causing serious mistakes and waste in the future. Cities with a better foundation of public utilities should pay attention to giving full play to the potential capacity of existing urban public utility equipment, improve business management, and increase equipment utilization, so as to reduce national investment.
    Second, we must quickly strengthen the overall planning and design work of important industrial cities. We must recognize that urban construction is a long-term plan for a century. The current construction must not only meet today's needs, but also lay the foundation for a better future. Its impact is far-reaching. Whether we are reconstructing old cities or building new cities, we must not develop in a chaotic manner like capitalist cities, but should adhere to the principles of economy, applicability, and beauty, and build our cities in a planned, step-by-step, and led manner. Therefore, important industrial cities should study the city's development prospects and development scale according to the industrial layout and the nature and natural conditions of the city in the country's first five-year plan, and prepare an overall urban plan. Only by carefully preparing the overall urban plan can we closely cooperate with the needs of industrial construction, so that future urban construction can be carried out step by step according to the overall plan, avoid chaos, and make fewer mistakes. In order to do a good job in the overall urban plan, it is necessary to strengthen the overall concept of various construction departments and oppose decentralization and departmentalism. All departments that carry out construction in the city should obey the overall nature of the city and respect the unified leadership of the urban construction department. The municipal organs also have the responsibility to strengthen the management, supervision, and inspection of urban construction, so as not to make today's construction an obstacle to the future development of the city. The urban area should also organize the relevant construction departments to be responsible for the design basic data required for factory construction, such as the survey and measurement of the terrain, the investigation and research of natural data such as geology, earthquake, hydrology, and meteorology, and the necessary economic data, so as to avoid repeated investigations and waste of human and financial resources.
    Third, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party committee and the government over urban construction. The Party committees and governments of important industrial cities should put strengthening the leadership of urban construction on the important agenda. Establish and improve the urban construction bureaus (sections) of the major regional financial and economic committees and the urban construction committees of important industrial cities. Transfer a certain number of capable cadres and technical personnel to strengthen this work, and organize the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building socialist cities, and pay attention to training and training a group of administrative cadres and technical cadres who can grasp urban construction work.
    We believe that as long as we earnestly implement the above-mentioned spirit and measures, urban construction work can be quickly brought onto the right track and achieve correct development.

    改进和加强城市建设工作
    随着国家工业建设的逐步开展，我国新兴的工业城市正在矿藏丰富的新工业基地建立起来或将要建立起来；原有的若干大城市和重要工业城市，也正随着工业建设比重的增加而日益扩展。如何改进和加强城市建设工作，有计划地建设新城市和改建旧城市的重大任务，现在已迫切地摆在我们面前，成为当前经济建设中的一个重要问题。
    四年来，我们不仅一般地恢复和维持了原有的市政设施，而且在发展生产的基础上，开始改善着城市劳动人民的物质生活和文化生活。特别在大城市中，工人的居住状况有了显著改善，仅据北京、天津、上海三个市的统计，一九五三年建筑的工人住宅即达一百八十八万平方公尺（如平均按十五平方公尺折一间，则合十二万五千三百多间）。由于国家对城市建设给予了很大投资，各地区在城市公用事业及文化教育建设上都做了许多事情，对工业建设及生产事业起了配合的作用，也相当地改善了这些城市劳动人民的卫生条件、交通条件和物质文化生活。
    但是，同时也应该指出，这些工作还不能完全满足城市劳动人民生活的需要，而且这种情况在今后相当的一个时期内仍可能继续存在，这一方面是因为旧社会长期遗留在城市里的各种不合理现象很多，不可能在短短的几年内完全改变过来，而更重要的是在国家建设的初期，我们在财政力量、技术条件和城市建设经验等方面，都还不能够对旧有的大城市很快地进行重大的改造，即使是一些重大的工业城市也只能有重点有步骤地进行建设，只有在保证国家工业不断发展的基础上，我们的城市建设才能逐步地向前发展起来。
    目前，有些地区的同志对这点认识不足，在城市建设工作中表现了急躁冒进、分散主义的倾向。不少城市在编制城市公用事业基本建设计划时，只考虑需要，不考虑国家的经济情况和技术力量的可能条件，企图百废俱兴，设想在短时期内使一切都要更新。结果，有一些城市因摊子铺得过多过大，设计施工力量赶不上，所有的工程质量都很低。有些城市在分配城市建设投资时，不是集中主要力量于保证工业生产和提高劳动人民福利的重点工程上去，而是分散投资，缺乏重点，结果花钱不少，而收效不大。也有些城市不注意发挥现有公用事业设备的潜在力量，不注意企业的经营管理与保养工作，只是忙于增建新的设备。所有这些，都造成了国家建设资金的浪费，和城市建设工作的正常进行。加以若干地方没有认真抓紧城市规划工作，对城市发展缺乏整体布局和统一领导，使工厂、住宅、交通运输及文教建设等方面的建设地区没有合理的布置，有的地方工业区内建筑了住宅，住宅区内修建了工厂；上游工厂的排水影响下游工厂和居民的供水；甚至发生前修后拆等混乱现象。这种盲目分散的混乱状况，如再继续发展，就会增加将来改建旧城市的极大困难。
    为了适应大规模建设事业的需要，我们必须迅速改进和加强城市建设工作，克服目前城市建设中的盲目、分散等混乱现象。为此，目前首先需要解决下列几个主要问题：
    第一、必须认真贯彻国家“重点建设稳步前进”的方针，把城市建设的投资，首先用在工业建设比重大的城市中去，至于工业比重小的一般中小城市，在第一个五年建设计划期内，应采取暂时维持的方针，一般不再扩大基本建设。在具体建设工程上同样也要有重点的进行，要保证城市建设为工业、为生产、为劳动人民服务的方针。目前城市建设投资主要应用在上下水道及改善城市环境卫生与发展城市交通方面（如道路、车辆）。应当根据城市总体规划及经济和技术条件的可能，分别轻重缓急，确定最重要的工程，反对百废俱兴的做法。当城市总体规划未定之前，不要过早地大兴土木，对于没有十分把握的重要工程，尤应慎重，避免盲目冒进，造成将来严重的错误和浪费。公用设备较有基础的城市，应注意充分发挥现在城市公用事业设备的潜在能力，改进经营管理，提高设备利用率，以减少国家的投资。
    第二、必须迅速加强重要工业城市的总体规划设计工作。我们必须认识：城市建设是百年大计，现在的建设不仅要满足今天的需要，而且更要为美好的未来打下基础。它的影响是长远的。我们不论改建旧有城市或建设新城市，不能像资本主义城市那样杂乱无章地发展，而应当坚持按照经济、适用、美观的原则，有计划、有步骤、有领导地来建设我们的城市。因此重要工业城市应根据国家第一个五年计划中的工业布局和城市的性质及自然条件，研究城市的发展远景和发展规模，编制城市总体规划方案。只有认真编好城市总体规划，才能够密切配合工业建设的需要，使今后城市建设按照总的计划有步骤地进行，避免混乱和少犯错误。为了作好城市的总体规划，必须加强各建设部门的整体观念，反对分散主义和本位主义。凡在城市中进行建筑的部门，应服从城市的整体性，尊重城市建设部门的统一领导。市政机关也有责任加强对城市建设的管理、监督和检查工作，不要使今天的建设变成为将来城市发展的障碍。对于建厂所需的设计基础资料、如地形的勘察测量，地质、地震、水文、气象等自然资料与必需的经济资料的调查研究，亦应由城市组织有关建设部门分工负责进行，以免重复调查，浪费人力财力。
    第三、必须加强党委和政府对于城市建设的领导。重要工业城市的党委和政府更要把加强城市建设的领导工作提到重要议事日程上来。要建立和健全各大区财政经济委员会的城市建设局（处）及重要工业城市的城市建设委员会。抽调一定数量的得力干部及技术人员加强此项工作，并组织学习苏联建设社会主义城市的先进经验，注意培养与训练一批能够掌握城市建设工作的行政干部和技术干部。
    我们相信，只要切实贯彻上述精神和措施，城市建设工作就可能迅速纳入正轨，获得正确的发展。
