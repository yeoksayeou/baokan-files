The New China Has Its Own Seamless Steel Tubes

At 2:30 pm on October 27th, the whistle of the newly built seamless steel tube factory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company sounded, signaling the order for hot trial rolling. Workers, cadres, and Soviet experts eagerly anticipated the successful rolling of seamless steel tubes. As people's hearts raced with anticipation, the first seamless steel tube was successfully rolled out. People couldn't help but cheer and applaud, unable to contain their joy. An old worker operating the straightening machine gently touched the newly rolled, smooth steel tube, praising it like a beloved child, saying, "Good! Good! Really good…." A Soviet expert tightly shook the hand of the Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, congratulating him and saying, "From today on, the New China has its own seamless steel tubes!"

What are Seamless Steel Tubes?

Perhaps some may ask: since there are "seamless steel tubes," then there must also be something called "seamed steel tubes"; and if it is a "tube," why does it have a seam?

We often see various kinds of tubes. According to the material used to make the tubes, they can be divided into iron pipes and steel pipes. Within steel pipes, we classify them into welded pipes and seamless pipes according to their manufacturing method. Welded pipes are welded from steel plates or steel strips, like the chimneys used by northerners for coal stoves in winter, having a welded seam. Some people call this kind of welded pipe a "seamed steel tube." The correct term should be "welded pipe."

Welded pipes are harder and more pressure-resistant than iron pipes. However, they have weaknesses. First, the welded area has poor pressure resistance. Second, they are made of ordinary quality steel. If they need to be bent during use or used in high-temperature and high-pressure environments (such as pressure exceeding 30 kilograms per square centimeter), there is a risk of cracking or bursting.

Seamless steel tubes are directly rolled from various kinds of high-quality steel, like a bamboo tube without any seams. How do workers turn solid steel billets into steel tubes? They first put the steel billets into a heating furnace to heat them until red-hot, and then use a machine to push the fiery red billet from the furnace onto the roller table of a piercing machine. The piercing machine is specifically for turning steel billets into the shape of steel tubes. It has two drum-like rollers with a mandrel in the middle that is harder than steel—specifically for piercing the hole. The two rollers clamp the steel billet and rotate rapidly. The billet rotates and advances toward the mandrel. At this time, a mandrel rod slightly smaller than the mandrel supports the mandrel, preventing it from rotating or retreating. Therefore, the steel billet, clamped by the rollers and spinning forward rapidly, is pierced through the middle by the mandrel, becoming the shape of a steel tube. After the steel tube comes out of the piercing machine, it automatically passes through a tube rolling mill (to roll the steel tube thinner), an equalizing machine (to make the tube wall uniformly thick), a sizing machine (to make the tube diameter meet the requirements), a straightening machine (to straighten the steel tube), and a tube cutting machine (to flatten the tube ends). The procedure for rolling steel tubes is then complete.

Seamless steel tubes can be made with a diameter of 600 millimeters, or into thin tubes with a diameter of a few millimeters; they can be made straight, or processed into curved shapes; they can be made round, or cold-drawn into various special shapes. These tubes can withstand heat up to 500 degrees Celsius and pressures of over 300 kilograms per square centimeter. (Welded pipes can only be used in places with temperatures below 100 degrees Celsius and pressures of 30 kilograms.) Because seamless steel tubes have these advantages, they have a very wide range of uses.

Seamless Steel Tubes and Our Daily Life

Many things are often like this for us: we don't recognize them, but we can't live without them in our lives.

Seamless steel tubes are also like this. Many of us haven't even heard of the name, but they have long been quietly influencing our lives.

The principle is very clear: farmers sell their surplus grain to supply the people in the cities; cotton farmers sell cotton to textile factories; herdsmen sell wool to wool textile mills; tobacco growers, fruit growers, tea growers, silkworm raisers, and fishermen also have to sell their products and buy back the agricultural tools, fertilizers, cloth, salt, etc. they need. What do we use to transport large quantities of grain, cotton, wool, etc. to large cities or factories, and transport large quantities of cloth, fertilizers, salt, etc. from the production areas to various places? We use trains, cars, ships or airplanes.

To manufacture trains, cars, ships, and airplanes, seamless steel tubes are essential. Locomotives and ships need boilers that generate thermal energy. Boilers need various shapes of boiler tubes and steam pipes to transport steam. These tubes need to withstand very high pressure and heat. If they were not seamless steel tubes but other tubes, they would burst. Manufacturing cars and airplanes requires many light tubes that can bear great strength, and these also require seamless steel tubes.

Without seamless steel tubes, there would be no ships sailing along our 10,000-plus li of coastline and tens of thousands of li of inland rivers, no trains running on our railways, no cars driving on the highways, and no airplanes flying in the sky. Large quantities of grain, cotton, and wool would not be easily transported out, and the production tools, cloth, salt, etc. needed in the countryside would not be easily transported in. If large cities or factories could not buy grain or industrial raw materials, and if the industrial products produced in factories could not be transported out, then the lives of people across the country would be greatly affected.

In the Days to Come

In Qingfeng County, Henan Province, in Kuhancun Village, there is a middle peasant named Ku Xi Han. His family includes his old couple, his young couple, and two small grandsons; 30 mu of land and an ox. Every year, the grain they harvest is enough to eat. Last year, he joined a mutual aid group of five households, but he wasn't very enthusiastic. He felt that the new society didn't favor landlords, the Communist Party didn't exploit people, and that life was already pretty good. It was like a tobacco plant growing four leaves, and if you pinched off the top, it would stay put, not rising, not falling, just focusing on those four leaves. However, after hearing the labor model Zhang Xuexiu from his village talk about his impressions during his visit to the Soviet Union, he realized that his thinking was wrong.

What did the Chinese farmers' delegation see in the Soviet Union last year?

They saw that in the Soviet collective farms, plowing, harrowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, cultivating, and weeding were all done by machines. Some farms used electricity for milking cows, feeding livestock, sawing wood, shearing sheep, grinding flour, extracting oil, and making wine. They saw airplanes being used for pest control, weeding, and fertilization. Some representatives were thrilled to use horse-drawn farm implements, but when they saw Soviet farmers using tractors and combines, and saw people sitting high on the driver's seat wearing anti-fouling gloves, they all said, "Wow! We're far behind!"

This is just the situation in Soviet collective farms. Of course, the work and life of Soviet urban workers are definitely not behind the collective farmers.

The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao not only led us to stand up, but also lead us to socialism, living a happy life like the Soviet people. To get to this point, we must build factories that can manufacture various machines, cars, tractors, airplanes, we must build many iron and steel and other metal smelting factories, chemical factories, we must build power plants, coal mines, oil factories and other power industries, and we must build many new railways.

No matter what industry we build, seamless steel tubes are indispensable.

For example, to build smelting factories, coal mines or oil factories, we need geological workers to survey what resources are underground, where they are, and how much there is, and then decide where to build the factories or mines. The drill rods and casing used by geological personnel for exploration drills are all made of seamless steel tubes. Because only seamless steel tubes can withstand the enormous pressure generated when the drill bit of the drilling machine drills downwards, and avoid the bursting of the casing.

Geological workers have completed the resource exploration work, and we have decided where to build coal mines and oil wells. However, seamless steel tubes are still needed in construction and production. We know that coal miners mine coal in pits tens or hundreds of zhang deep, and there is very little air in the pits. We must use air compressors to compress air from the ground into the mine pits for the workers to breathe in order to ensure the workers' health. And manufacturing air compressors also requires seamless steel tubes.

The petroleum industry uses seamless steel tubes even more extensively. The well wall of an oil well is made of seamless steel tubes, and seamless steel tubes are also used to transport oil from the wellhead to the oil pool. In the refinery, when "fractionating" (separating petroleum into light oil, heavy oil, kerosene, etc.) and "cracking" (converting some heavy oil into light oil), the temperature of the steam is high and the pressure is high, and seamless steel tubes are essential.

In the days to come, we will not only use electricity to turn the machines in factories, but also use electricity to drive tractors to plow the land, use electricity to drive combines to harvest and thresh, use electricity to weed, etc.; we will put the tiny oil lamps and candles in historical museums and replace them with electric lights. Therefore, we will build many power plants in cities and villages, and connect cities and villages into a power grid. However, we know that a power plant cannot be built without seamless steel tubes for the boilers.

In the near future, we will also use tractors to plow the land like the Soviet Union. Tractors, like cars and locomotives, cannot move without seamless steel tubes.

From this, we can understand how closely seamless steel tubes are related to our future life!

Why Build a Seamless Steel Tube Factory First?

China's first Five-Year Plan stipulates that we should concentrate our main efforts on developing heavy industry. Why does China put the seamless steel tube factory among the first factories to be built in the development of heavy industry? This is because, as mentioned above, seamless steel tubes are indispensable for China's development of coal, electricity, petroleum, machinery, automobile, and defense industries. In the past, the seamless steel tubes we used were all imported from abroad, costing a lot of money and still not meeting our needs. Now, we have built the first seamless steel tube factory in Anshan. Although the steel tubes produced by this factory, whether in quantity or variety, cannot yet meet China's current needs, it will be able to initially meet the urgent needs of China's current geological exploration, petroleum, and machinery manufacturing. With these seamless steel tubes, our geological exploration teams will be appropriately expanded, accelerating the exploration of underground treasures; our petroleum industry will be appropriately developed; and the production of boilers for our power plants will also be improved. That is to say, after the Anshan Iron and Steel's seamless steel tubes begin production, it will promote the development of China's geological work, petroleum industry, machinery industry, and power industry. The development of these industries will in turn promote the development of other industries.

The Power of the People is Great

The Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Factory is built according to the latest experience of Soviet science and technology, and is now a world-class automated factory. In production, the first step is to load the steel materials into the heating furnace for heating. When loading the materials, the worker sits at the operating platform far away from the heating furnace, presses the button, and rows of steel materials are sent into the furnace by the turnover machine. After the steel materials in the furnace are heated, the pushing machine automatically sends them to the piercing machine (the second process). Here, what is needed is not the worker's heavy physical labor, but the worker's brainpower and mastery of complex technology. A factory like this, not a single one existed in old China, and in the people's China, it was built in just over a year. This proves that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and with the help of the Soviet Union, the power of the Chinese people is great.

We concentrated our efforts to build this factory well under the leadership of Chairman Mao. In order to build this factory, our countryside sent outstanding producers to Anshan, our factories sent outstanding workers and engineering and technical personnel to Anshan, and our universities sent the most outstanding graduates and professors to Anshan. Many of our factories manufactured various materials and equipment for this factory. In Shanghai alone, from June last year to April this year, more than 100 factories manufactured more than 60 kinds of equipment and materials for it. Forestry workers in the Xing'an Mountains, Ganjiang and Xiangjiang River basins manufactured more than 10,000 cubic meters of timber for it, and workers at Chongqing Factory 101 manufactured heavy steel rails for it. To describe the scale of this national support in the words of Anshan workers, it is: "Talent comes from the east, west, north, and south, and materials are sent from all directions."

The Heroic Deeds of the Working Class in Building the Motherland

Let me briefly talk about the Anshan workers who directly built this factory. Without their selfless labor and creative spirit, the factory could not have been built.

We will always remember Huang Jiguang's heroic deeds in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. There were also such heroes in the construction of the seamless steel tube factory. Last summer, the pillar foundation of Workshop No. 11 needed to be replaced. After digging a pit nearly two zhang deep around the foundation, the crossbar supporting the surrounding pressure suddenly developed cracks and fractures, the soil around the pit kept collapsing, and groundwater gushed out. The pit wall was about to completely collapse. If the pit wall collapsed, the steel roof frame of the workshop would be deformed, and even the workshop would collapse. In this way, the country would suffer huge losses and the progress of the project would be delayed. However, whoever went down to rescue it would be in danger of being crushed to death in the pit. At this critical moment, workers Wang Hongfa, Meng Qingguo, Yuan Youren, etc., who were working elsewhere, ran over immediately after hearing the news. Wang Hongfa saw the dangerous situation and jumped into the pit first without saying a word. Meng Qingguo shouted, "Hurry down!" and led other workers to jump down. In waist-deep water, with their feet deep in the mud, they fought bravely from 8:00 p.m. until the next morning, and finally rescued the project. When they came out of the pit, their clothes were soaked in mud and water, and they couldn't even straighten their backs. They achieved the victory of "replacing the foundation of the pillar" with selfless heroic deeds.

In the construction, many difficulties that had never been seen before were encountered in technology. One of the difficulties encountered during the installation of the machines was one of them. A machine has hundreds of parts, and some parts weigh tens of thousands of kilograms. There are nearly 10,000 machine foundation bolts alone, and the large ones weigh more than 3,600 kilograms. The tolerance of each foundation bolt to the center line must not exceed 5 millimeters. If it exceeds 5 millimeters, thousands of cubic meters of concrete foundation must be blasted and redone. The installation of thousands of tons of machines in the entire factory must also be placed on a certain center line and elevation point without any error. If the difference exceeds a quarter of the thickness of a hair, the machine cannot manufacture steel tubes. Who has ever seen such technical requirements? Zhang Jiaming and his team, who installed the foundation bolts, humbly learned from Soviet experts and asked technical personnel for advice. They finally created a method of finding the center line and elevation, and created a flow operation method for installation, overcoming this difficulty and shortening the time for finding the center line and installing the machines, so that the project could be completed according to plan.

The Soviet Union Fully Helps Us

"I am a Soviet, and every Soviet cares about the construction of the great People's Republic of China. I hope that the Chinese people will soon be able to enjoy the same happy life as the Soviet people!"

This is what Comrade Kuzminko, who was sent by the Soviet government to help us build the seamless steel tube factory, said. It shows that the friendly help given to us by the Soviet Union is out of a sincere desire to achieve China's economic upsurge. The Soviet government mobilized thousands of the most outstanding engineers to design for us, and mobilized more than 30 factories in large cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, and Sverdlovsk to manufacture automated and mechanized equipment for us, and transported them in time by train and plane.

At the beginning of the geological survey, Soviet design experts and geological experts came to the waste weir full of weeds to help our geological survey personnel collect design data. Antonov, a 64-year-old design expert, climbed to the top of the workshop, tens of zhang high, several times to study and test in order to use the steel columns of the old workshop. The first geological expert to come to Anshan personally went down to the pit, two or three zhang deep, to help our technical personnel study the soil composition and pressure resistance. Comrade Viqitovmov, the expert guiding the construction, designed mechanized construction equipment for us, pioneering mechanized factory construction in China's construction projects, saving us hundreds of billions of yuan and enabling the factory to be put into production earlier. Being able to produce one day earlier can increase the value of labor equivalent to one day of labor for 110,000 farmers for the country.

Not only that, but the Ural First Seamless Steel Tube Factory named after Comrade Stalin also trained the first batch of production workers who operate automated equipment for China. The director of this factory especially instructed the comrades who served as teachers, "You must be fully responsible for the Chinese interns sent by Comrade Mao Zedong! Teach them the whole set of technology and let them return fully loaded!" Comrade Gagov, an honorary metallurgical worker who has won three medals and is the furnace chief of the heating furnace, stood behind the Chinese workers every day to teach them every movement in order to teach all of his 20 years of experience to the Chinese workers. When sending the workers we sent to study back to China, he repeatedly urged them, "Comrades, you will still encounter problems when you go back to participate in production. Be sure to write to me if you have any questions!"

The Soviet government has also sent more than ten production experts to Anshan to help the factory start production. Experts opened technical lectures for production and technical personnel in the factory, from the use of seamless steel tubes to how to start the machines.

Striving for the Early Arrival of Socialism

The farmers of Luokuang Village, a village with high rice yields in the suburbs of Nanjing, said well: "Our country's industrialization is the foundation of happiness for all our people." Our foundation is now just beginning to be built, and it is not yet solid. The construction of the seamless steel tube factory is only the first step that our country has completed in the long journey of industrial construction. We must build a second, a third...a seamless steel tube factory, and in the next few years, we must build hundreds of projects as large as, or even larger than, the seamless steel tube factory, and build the foundation well.

We look forward to the early arrival of the happy life of socialism, but it will not fall from the sky like rain, nor will it pop out of the ground like mushrooms. It will only come if all our people work together. For it, our working class must learn from the Soviet Union, learn technology, and work selflessly, just like the comrades who built Anshan.

Our farmers must do as the farmers of Luokuang Village said: even in the cold winter, there should be no idle people, men should repair dikes, women should organize to carry mud ponds, old men and old women should cook and take care of babies, and children of eight or nine years old should pick up manure. When planting crops, we must adopt advanced farming techniques to increase production. We must sell the surplus grain to the state to support national construction!

The comrades of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army must have the determination of the comrades of the "Tashan Hero Regiment": "Continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, heighten vigilance, strengthen learning, defend the country's planned economic construction, and defend world lasting peace."

The students studying in schools should be like the students in Class C of Grade Three of Beijing No. 25 Middle School - Anshan Class:

"We must care about the country's construction, learn the excellent qualities of the Anshan workers, and in study, physical exercise, and various activities, we must be as tenacious, organized, and disciplined as the Anshan workers, and complete the study tasks assigned to us by the motherland outstandingly, and train ourselves into 'Anshan-style' construction talents."

    无缝钢管和人民生活的关系
    陆超祺
    新中国有自己的无缝钢管了
    十月二十七日下午两点半钟，我国新建成的鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂的汽笛鸣响了一声，这是命令热试轧的汽笛，参加试轧的工人、干部和苏联专家们，都在热烈盼望能够顺利地轧出无缝钢管来。正在人们的心紧张地跳动的时候，第一根无缝钢管顺利地轧制出来了。人们不禁欢呼和鼓掌起来，抑制不住内心的高兴，一位操纵矫正机的老工人用手轻轻地摸着刚轧出来的又光又滑的钢管，像抚摸亲生的孩子一样，连声称赞道：“好！好！真好……。”一位苏联专家紧紧地握着在场的中共鞍山市委书记的手祝贺说：“新中国从今天起就有自己的无缝钢管了！”
    什么叫做无缝钢管
    也许有人要问：既然有“无缝钢管”，那末一定还有一种叫做“有缝钢管”了；既然是“管”，为什么又有缝呢？
    我们经常看到各种各样的管子。按照做成管子的材料来分，可以分为铁管和钢管。在钢管里面，我们按照制造的方法，把它们分为焊管和无缝管。焊管是用钢板或钢带焊接起来的，像北方人冬天烧煤炉时用的烟筒一样，有一道焊起来的接缝。有人把这种焊管叫做“有缝钢管”。正确的说法，应该是“焊管”。
    焊管比铁管硬，比铁管耐压。但是，它有弱点。第一、焊接的地方耐压力差，第二、它是用普通质量的钢做成的，如果在使用时需要弯曲或者用在高温高压（如每平方公分的压力超过三十公斤时）的地方，就有裂开或崩裂的危险。
    无缝钢管是用各种各样的优质钢直接轧制出来的，像竹筒一样没有接缝。工人们怎样把实心的钢坯变成钢管呢？原来他们先把钢坯放在加热炉里烧红，然后又用一个机器把火红的钢坯从炉里推到穿孔机的辊道上。穿孔机是专门把钢坯变成钢管的模样的。它有两个像鼓一样的辊子，辊子中间有一根比钢还硬的顶针——专管穿眼的。两个辊子夹着钢坯飞快地旋转起来，钢坯一面转，一面向顶针方面前进。这时候，顶针后面有一根比顶针略小的顶杆把顶针顶住，使它不能转动，也不能后退。因此，被辊子夹着向前飞转的钢坯，便被顶针从中间穿了一个透心的圆孔，就变成钢管的模样了。钢管从穿孔机出来后，便顺着自动化的设备经过轧管机（把钢管轧薄）、均整机（把管壁轧得厚薄均匀）、定径机（使管的口径合乎要求）、矫正机（把钢管矫直）、切管机（把管头切平）。轧制钢管的手续便完了。
    无缝钢管可以制成六百公厘口径的，也可以制成几公厘直径的细管；可以制成直的，也可以加工成为弯弯曲曲的；可以制造圆形的，也可以冷拔成各种特殊形状的。这种管子可以承受高达摄氏五百度以上的热，每平方公分达三百公斤以上的压力。（焊管只能用在温度一百度以下，压力三十公斤的地方。）无缝钢管有这些优点，用途非常广。
    无缝钢管和我们的日常生活
    许多东西对于我们往往是这样：我们并不认识它们，但我们在生活中却少不了它们。
    无缝钢管也是这样，我们许多人甚至连这名儿还没听说过，但是它早就不声不响地影响着我们的生活。
    这个道理是很明白的：农民要把多余的粮食出卖供给城市里的人；棉农要把棉花出卖供给纺织工厂；牧民要把羊毛出卖供给毛纺织厂；种烟的、种果子的、种茶的、养蚕的、捕鱼的人也同样要把他们的产品卖出去，买回自己所需要的农具、肥料、布、食盐等等。我们用什么来把大批的粮食、棉花、羊毛等等运到大城市，或工厂去，又把大批的布匹、肥料、食盐等等从产地运到各地去呢？这就要用火车、汽车、轮船或飞机。
    要制造火车、汽车、轮船和飞机，没有无缝钢管是不行的。火车头和轮船都要有发生热能的锅炉，锅炉需要各种形状的锅炉管和输送蒸汽的蒸汽管子，这些管子要承受很高的压力和热力，如果不是无缝钢管而是别的管子的话，就要崩开。制造汽车和飞机需要许多很轻的但能担负很大的力量的管子，这也非用无缝钢管不可。
    如果没有无缝钢管，在我们一万多里的沿海、数万里的内河便没有轮船航行，在我们的铁路上便没有火车行走，在公路上便没有汽车行驶，在天空中便没有飞机飞行，大批的粮食、棉花、羊毛就不容易运出去，农村所需要的生产工具、布匹、食盐等就不容易运来。如果大城市或工厂里买不到粮食或工业原料，如果工厂里生产的工业品运不出去，那么，全国人民的生活就会受到很大的影响。
      在未来的日子里
    河南省清丰县库韩村，有一个中农叫库喜韩，家里有老俩口，小俩口，还有两个小孙孙；三十亩地一头牛，年年打的粮食够吃。去年，他参加了一个由五家组成的互助组，可是干得不很起劲，觉得新社会不兴地主，共产党不兴剥削人，觉得现在的日子已经闹得不错了，就像一棵烟长了四个叶，把尖一揪齐住顶，不上升，不下降，光向这四个叶上使劲就成了。但是，他听到了他们村的劳动模范张学修谈了在苏联参观时的感想时，知道自己的想法错了。
    去年中国农民代表参观团在苏联看到了什么呢？
    他们看到了苏联的集体农庄耕地、耙地、播种、收割、脱粒、中耕、除草都已经用机器了，有些农庄挤牛奶、喂牲口、锯木料、剪羊毛、磨面、榨油、造酒等全用电力；看到用飞机杀虫、除草、施肥。原来有些代表使用了马拉农具后都高兴得了不得，可是看到苏联农民使用拖拉机、康拜因，看到人们坐在驾驶台上，离地面高高的，手里还戴着防垢的手套，都说：“嗬！咱们还差得远哩！”
    这只是苏联集体农庄的情形。当然，苏联城市工人的工作和生活也绝不落在集体农民后面。
    中国共产党和毛主席不只领导咱们翻了身，还要领导咱们走上社会主义，过着像苏联人民那样的幸福生活。我们要走到这一步，就得建设能够制造各种机器、汽车、拖拉机、飞机的工厂，就得建设很多钢铁及其他金属冶炼工厂，化学工厂，就得建立发电厂、煤井、石油厂等动力工业，就得建设很多新的铁路。
    不论建设什么工业，都少不了无缝钢管。
    譬如要建设冶炼工厂，要建设煤井或石油工厂，我们就要地质工作人员勘察地下有什么资源，在哪里，有多少，然后才决定把工厂或矿井建在什么地方。地质人员进行勘察用的钻探机的钻杆和管套管，都是用无缝钢管做的。因为只有无缝钢管才能承受钻探机钻头向下钻时所发生的巨大的压力，才能避免套管的崩裂。
    地质工作人员已完成了勘察资源工作，我们也已决定了该在哪里建设煤井和石油井。但是，在建设和生产中，还要用无缝钢管。我们知道，煤矿工人在几十丈几百丈深的坑里采煤，坑里的空气非常少。我们必须用空气压缩机从地面上把空气压到矿坑里给工人呼吸，才能保证工人健康。而制造空气压缩机也要用无缝钢管。
    石油工业用无缝钢管的地方更多。油井的井壁是无缝钢管，从井口把石油输送到油池也用无缝钢管，在炼油厂里，实行“分溜”（把石油分为轻油、重油、煤油等），“裂化”（把一部重油变为轻油）时，蒸汽的温度高，压力大，也非用无缝钢管不可。
    在未来的日子里，我们不仅用电来转动工厂的机器，还要用电来开动拖拉机耕地，用电来开动康拜因收割、脱粒，用电来除草等等；我们要把豆大的油灯、蜡烛收到历史博物馆里去，用电灯来代替它们。因此，我们就要在城市、农村建设很多发电厂，要把城市和乡村连成一个电网。可是，我们知道一个发电厂所用锅炉没有无缝钢管是不成的。
    我们在不久的将来也要像苏联一样用拖拉机来耕地。拖拉机也像汽车，像火车头一样，没有无缝钢管就不能够走动。
    由此我们便知道，无缝钢管与我们的未来生活有多么密切的关系啊！
    为什么首先建设无缝钢管厂
    我国第一个五年计划规定要集中主要力量发展重工业。为什么我国在建设重工业中又把无缝钢管厂放在首先建设的工厂之中呢？这是因为，像上面说过的，无缝钢管是我国发展煤、电、石油、机械、汽车和国防工业不可缺少的。我国过去所用的无缝钢管都是由国外进口的，每年花很多钱还不能满足需要。现在，我们已经在鞍山建成第一座无缝钢管厂。虽然，这座工厂所出产钢管，不论是数量和品种都还不能满足我国现在的需要，但是，它将能初步满足我国目前地质钻探、石油、和机械制造方面所急需的钢管。有了这些无缝钢管，我们的地质钻探工作队伍将要适当扩大，加速地下宝藏的勘察；我们的石油工业将要得到适当的发展；我们建设发电厂用的锅炉的生产也将提高。这就是说，鞍钢无缝钢管开始生产以后，将促进我国地质工作、石油工业、机械工业和电业的发展。由于这些工业的发展又会推动其他工业发展。
      人民的力量是伟大的
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂是按照苏联科学技术的最新的经验建设起来的，是现在世界上第一流的自动化工厂。在生产中第一道工序是把钢料装到加热炉里去加热。装料时，工人坐在离加热炉远远的操作台上把电钮一按，一排排的钢料就被翻料机送进炉子去。炉子里的钢料加热好后，推料机又自动地把它们送到穿孔机（第二道工序）上去了。在这里，不是要工人的沉重的体力，而是要工人动脑筋，掌握复杂的技术。像这样的工厂，在旧中国一个也没有，在人民的中国，只要一年多的时间就建设起来。这证明了在毛主席的领导下，在苏联的帮助下，我国人民的力量是伟大的。
    我们是在毛主席的领导下，集中力量把这个工厂建设好的。为了建设这个工厂，我们的农村把优秀的生产者送到鞍山去，我们的工厂把优秀的工人和工程技术人员送到鞍山去，我们的高等学校把最优秀的毕业生和教授送到鞍山去。我们有很多工厂都为这个工厂制造各种器材和设备。仅仅在上海，从去年六月到今年四月，就有一百多家工厂给它制造六十多种设备和器材。兴安岭、赣江和湘江流域的林业工人给它制造一万多立方公尺的木材，重庆一○一厂的工人给它制造重钢轨。这个全国支援的规模，要用鞍山工人的话来形容，就是：“东西南北来人材，四面八方送物资。”
      工人阶级在建设祖国中的
        英雄行为
    让我简单地讲一讲直接建设这个工厂的鞍山工人们。没有他们的忘我劳动和创造精神，是不能把工厂建设起来的。
    我们永远记得黄继光在抗美援朝战斗中的英雄事迹。在建设无缝钢管厂中也有这样的英雄。去年夏天，十一号厂房支柱基础需要更换。当基础周围已经挖了将近两丈深的深坑以后，支撑四周压力的横板忽然发生裂纹和折断现象，坑四周的泥土不断地塌下来，地下水也涌出来，坑壁就要完全塌了。坑壁一塌，厂房的钢屋架就会变形，甚至厂房就会倒塌。这样，国家就要遭受巨大损失，工程进度就要推迟。但是，谁下去抢救，谁就有被压死在坑里的危险。就在这千钧一发的时候，正在别处工作的工人王洪法、孟庆国、袁有仁等听到了消息马上跑来了。王洪法看到这个危险情况，什么话也没说，就首先跳下坑去。孟庆国喊了一声“快下去啊！”就带着其他工人跳下去了。他们在漫腰深的水里，两脚深陷在泥里，奋不顾身地从晚上八点钟搏斗到第二天早晨，终于把工程抢救过来。他们从坑里上来时，衣服都被泥水湿透了，连腰也直不起来。他们以忘我的英雄行为取得了“托柱换基”的胜利。
    在建设中，在技术上遇到很多从来没有见过的困难。安装机器时所遇到的困难就是其中的一个。一部机器有上百个部件，有的一个部件就有几万斤重。只是机器地脚螺丝就有近万个，大的就有重三千六百多斤的。每个地脚螺丝与中心线的公差不得超过五公厘，如果超过五公厘，就得把上千立方公尺的混凝土基础炸毁重做。全厂数千吨的机器安装，也要丝毫不差地放在一定的中心线和标高点上，如果相差超过一根头发丝的四分之一，机器就不能制造钢管。谁见过这样的技术要求呢？安装地脚螺丝的张甲明和他的小组，虚心地向苏联专家学习，向技术人员请教，终于创造了找中心线，找标高的办法，创造了安装的流水作业法，克服了这个困难，缩短了找中心线和安装机器的时间，使工程能按计划完成。
      苏联全面帮助我们
    “我是一个苏联人，每一个苏联人都关怀着伟大的中华人民共和国的建设，我希望中国人民很快地就可享受到和苏联人民一样的幸福生活！”
    这是苏联政府派来帮助我们建设无缝钢管厂的库兹明柯同志所说的话。它说明了苏联给我们的友谊的帮助，是出于求得我国经济高涨的真诚的愿望的。苏联政府动员了数以千计的最优秀的工程师给我们设计，动员莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维尔德洛夫等大城市三十多个工厂给我们制造自动化、机械化的设备，及时地用火车和飞机把它们运来。
    在开始地质勘察的时候，苏联的设计专家和地质专家就来到长满野草的废圩上，帮助我国的地质勘察人员搜集设计资料。六十四岁的设计专家安东诺夫为了利用旧厂房的钢柱，曾几次地爬到几十丈高的厂房顶上去研究和试验。第一个来到鞍钢的地质专家，亲自下到两三丈深的坑里去帮助我国技术人员研究土质成分和耐压力。指导施工的专家维企托莫夫同志，给我们设计机械化施工的设备，在我国建筑工程中开创了机械化工厂化施工，给我们节省了数百亿元资金，使工厂提早投入生产。工厂能提早一天生产，就能为国家增加相当于十一万农民一天的劳动价值。
    不仅如此。以斯大林同志的名字命名的乌拉尔第一无缝钢管厂，还为我国培养了第一批操纵自动化设备的生产工人。这个工厂的厂长特别嘱咐担任教师的同志说：“你们要全面地对毛泽东同志派来的中国实习生负责！把全套技术教给他们，让他们满载而归！”得过三次勋章的荣誉冶金工作者、加热炉的炉长加果夫同志，为了把二十多年的经验全教给中国工人，他每天站在中国工人后面，把着手教他们每一个动作。在送我国去学习的工人回国时，他又再三嘱咐他们说：“同志，回去参加生产还会遇到问题，千万要来信问我啊！”
    苏联政府又派十余位生产专家来鞍钢帮助工厂开工生产。专家在工厂里开办生产技术人员的技术讲座，从无缝钢管的用途一直讲到如何开动机器。
    争取社会主义的早日来临
    南京市郊水稻丰产村——螺圹村的农民说得好：“我们国家工业化就是我们全国人民幸福的根基。”我们的根基现在还正在开始建筑，还不牢靠。无缝钢管厂的建设，只不过是我国在工业建设的长途中走完了第一步。我们还要建第二个、第三个……个无缝钢管厂，在今后几年内，还要建设成百的像无缝钢管厂那样大的、甚至更大的工程，把根基打得好好的。
      我们盼望社会主义的幸福生活早日来临，但它不像雨一样会从天上掉下来，也不像蘑菇一样会从地里冒出来。它是要我们全国人民共同努力才会到来的。为了它，我们工人阶级，就要像建设鞍山的同志一样，努力学习苏联，学习技术，忘我地劳动。
    我们的农民，就要做到像螺圹村的农民所说的：即使在寒冷的冬天也做到没有一个闲人，男人修堤，妇女组织起来挑泥塘，老头子老太太做饭看娃娃，八、九岁的孩子们拾粪。在种地的时候，要采用先进的耕作技术，提高生产。要给余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设！
    解放军和志愿军的同志们，就要有“塔山英雄团”的同志们的决心：“继续发扬爱国主义和革命英雄主义的光荣传统，提高警惕，加强学习，保卫祖国有计划经济建设，保卫世界持久和平。”
    在学校里学习的同学们，就要像北京市第二十五中学高三班丙班——鞍钢班——的同学们一样：
  “要关心祖国的建设事业，学习鞍钢工人的优秀品质，在学习上、体格锻炼上、在各种活动中，要像鞍钢工人那样顽强、有组织有纪律、出色地完成祖国交给的学习任务，锻炼成‘鞍钢式’的建设人才。”
