Newspaper Review

Reducing grain loss and doing a good job in grain storage to effectively reduce grain loss is an important part of increasing production and practicing economy for grain departments. The Zhejiang Daily on October 16th introduced the model case of YuHang County creating insect-free granaries in a prominent front-page position on the second page. In the past year, YuHang County has achieved great results in grain storage. 55% of the county's granaries (excluding empty granaries) have eliminated insect pests and met the requirements of "insect-free granaries." For this, the Grain Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government issued a circular of commendation. YuHang County has achieved such achievements in grain storage because the county's Grain Bureau attaches importance to grain storage and strengthens leadership in storage work. Before and after the delivery of public grain into storage last year, the county's Grain Bureau organized inspection teams to inspect grain storage work in various granaries five or six times, helping grassroots grain storage units solve specific difficulties in grain storage. At the beginning of April this year, it also led the county's granaries to carry out the work of eliminating overwintering grain insects, and regarded the work of preventing and controlling grain insects as one of the indicators of labor competition. All grain storage personnel have demonstrated a high degree of spirit of cherishing national wealth. They are very vigilant and pay attention to the growth of grain insects. As long as one or two insects are found in the warehouse, they immediately spray medicine to kill them. In order to eliminate overwintering grain insects, many storage personnel climbed to the bottom of the warehouse to carry out cleaning work. As for why many granaries in the county can achieve "insect-free," the basic experience is: resolutely implement the policy of "prevention is more important than cure," thoroughly disinfect empty warehouses before grain is put into storage, and always keep the warehouse clean inside and outside after grain is put into storage. Before the new grain was put into storage last year, all granaries carried out thorough cleaning, achieving six-sided cleanliness in the warehouse (the top and bottom and four walls were cleaned), and three-no-left-overs outside the warehouse (removing bricks, tiles, weeds, and dirt), digging out pests in the wall crevices, blocking insect crevices, and disinfecting inside and outside with agents, and also exposing and brushing all warehouse tools, and replacing them with dry new rice husks as a base. After the grain was put into storage, the granaries diligently cleaned and carefully inspected, and dealt with insect pests in a timely manner as soon as they were discovered, and always kept the granaries clean. Therefore, insect pests were reduced and even eliminated. The Zhejiang Daily, taking the facts of YuHang County as an example, published a brief commentary entitled "Create More Insect-Free Granaries," pointing out that implementing the policy of "prevention is more important than cure" in grain storage is not only necessary, but also feasible. The conservative ideas that grain insects cannot be eliminated at all and that scientific grain management methods cannot prevent insect pests are wrong and unfounded. However, in order to eliminate insect pests in granaries, in addition to a clear policy and the work enthusiasm of grain storage personnel, it is more important that the leading organs of grain departments at all levels must strengthen leadership in grain storage work.

In addition to introducing the advanced experience of YuHang County in grain storage, the Zhejiang Daily also commended the model deeds of some grain storage personnel on October 16th and 18th. For example, Jiang Nianfa, a storage worker of the Suian County Grain Bureau, overcame difficulties during the moldy rainy season this year in order to prevent national grain from being lost, climbed into the bottom of the warehouse, which was only eight inches to one foot high, to clean up grain insects and garbage, eliminate "dead corners" in storage, and reduce insect damage to stored grain. Chen Zhixing, a storage worker of the Ruian County Grain Bureau, has always worked tirelessly to catch mice. From March to mid-September this year, he caught 186 mice alone and motivated other staff to actively catch mice, thereby reducing the loss of stored grain. On the other hand, the newspaper criticized those units and personnel who did not take a responsible attitude towards grain storage. The reader's letter summary published on October 18th exposed the bureaucratic style of some leading cadres and storage personnel in grain departments. For example, the director of the Gaobu District Grain Depot in Shaoxing County had not been to the warehouse for more than a month. The director of the grain depot did not even know about the "Third Quarter Grain Storage Work Plan" and "Wheat Storage Measures" issued by the County Grain Bureau in July. The person in charge of the Ninghai County Directly Subordinate Grain Depot had been in office for four months and still did not know how many warehouses there were in his unit. The wheat stored in the Maple Tree Hall Cooperative in Tiantai County was eaten by insects and became moldy and deteriorated because the storage personnel had not inspected it for three consecutive months. These formed a sharp contrast with the model figures and events on the grain storage work front.

At present, all localities are carrying out autumn grain purchase and autumn tax collection work. In order to promote everyone to further improve grain storage work, it is very necessary for newspapers to pay attention to disseminating advanced experience in grain storage and carry out correct commendation and criticism.

### 降低粮食的损耗

    降低粮食的损耗
    做好粮食保管工作，切实降低粮食的损耗，是粮食部门增产节约的一项重要内容。浙江日报十月十六日以二版头条地位介绍了余杭县创造无虫粮仓的模范事例。一年来，余杭县的粮食保管工作获得了很大成绩，全县有百分之五十五的粮仓（不包括空仓）消灭了虫害，达到“无虫仓”的要求。为此，浙江省人民政府粮食厅特通报嘉奖。馀杭县在粮食保管工作中所以取得这样的成绩，是因为该县粮食局重视粮食保管工作，加强了对仓储工作的领导。去年公粮入库前后，该县粮食局曾五、六次组织检查组到各粮库检查保粮工作，帮助基层粮食保管单位解决保管粮食中的具体困难。今年四月初，又领导全县粮库开展了越冬仓虫扑灭工作，并把仓虫防治工作作为劳动竞赛的指标之一。全体粮食保管人员，则发挥了高度的爱护国家财富的精神。他们十分警惕地注意粮虫的生长情况，只要仓内发现有一、二只虫子，就立即喷药扑灭。为了消灭越冬仓虫，许多保管人员都爬到仓底下面去进行打扫工作。至于该县许多粮仓所以能做到“无虫”，基本经验是：坚决贯彻了“防重于治”的方针，在粮食入库以前彻底进行空仓消毒，粮食入库以后经常保持仓库内外清洁卫生。去年新粮入库前，各粮库曾进行了彻底清扫，做到仓内六面光（上下、四面墙壁都打扫清洁），仓外三不留（清除砖瓦、青草、污物），挖出了壁缝中的害虫，堵死了虫缝，并用药剂进行了内外消毒，还将所有仓具进行了曝晒、打刷，又换上干燥的新砻糠垫底。在粮食入库以后，各粮库又勤打扫，细检查，一发现虫害便及时处理，并始终保持粮库的清洁。因此，就减少以至消灭了虫害。浙江日报以余杭县的事实为例，发表了题为“创造更多的无虫粮仓”的简评，指出在粮食保管工作中贯彻“防重于治”的方针，不但必要，而且可行。那种认为仓虫根本无法消灭和不相信用科学的管理粮食的办法可以防止虫害的保守思想是错误的，没有根据的。但要消灭粮仓的虫害，除有明确的方针和粮食保管人员的工作热情以外，更重要的是各级粮食部门的领导机关必须加强对粮食保管工作的领导。
    浙江日报除介绍了余杭县保管粮食的先进经验外，还在十月十六日、十八日表扬了一些粮食保管人员的模范事迹。如遂安县粮食局保管员蒋念法在今年霉雨季节，为了不使国家粮食受到损失，曾克服困难，爬进只有八寸到一尺高的仓底打扫粮虫和垃圾，消灭了保管中的“死角”，减轻了仓存粮食的虫害。瑞安县粮食局保管员陈志星一贯不辞辛苦地捕捉老鼠。自今年三月份到九月中旬，他一个人就捕获老鼠一百八十六只，并带动了其他工作人员也积极捕鼠，从而减少了存粮的损失。在另一方面，报纸对那些不以负责态度保管粮食的单位和人员提出了批评。十月十八日发表的读者来信综述就揭露了某些粮食部门领导干部和保管人员的官僚主义作风。如绍兴县皋埠区粮库主任有一个多月未到仓房去，七月份县粮食局发下的“第三季度保粮工作计划”和“小麦保管办法”等文件，粮库主任竟不知道。宁海县直属粮库的负责人到职已四个月，还不知道本单位有几个仓房。天台县枫树殿合作社所存小麦，由于保管人员接连三个月没有检查，以致被蛀虫蛀食，霉烂变质。这些恰和粮食保管工作战线上的模范人物和事例形成了鲜明的对比。
    目前各地正在开展秋粮收购和秋征工作。为推动大家进一步做好粮食保管工作，报纸注意传播保粮方面的先进经验，进行正确的表扬和批评，是十分必要的。
