    The Most Rational and Effective Use of Our Grain
    Yan Ling
    Our national economic construction is advancing at an unprecedented scale and speed in our nation’s history. For a considerable period, the rate of grain increase will not be able to keep up with the demands of the country and the people for grain. However, judging from our country's overall grain situation, as long as grain is used properly and waste is reduced as much as possible, this difficulty we encounter in our progress can be completely overcome.
    To ensure that the increase in grain can gradually adapt to the development of the entire economic construction and the improvement of people's lives, the most fundamental way is naturally to gradually place agricultural production on the basis of mechanization and collectivization. However, this cannot be achieved quickly and must be done step by step. In addition to steadily developing agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations on the existing basis, and improving agricultural tools and technology to increase grain production, we must pay special attention to reducing grain waste at present. In addition to careful harvesting and threshing in the fields and on the threshing grounds, striving to reduce losses during grain transportation, and strengthening grain storage management after it enters the warehouses, the principle of "making the best use of everything" must also be followed in terms of grain use.
    Regarding the use of grain, the following aspects should be noted:
    I. Increase the purity of grain processing and reduce the precision of grain processing. Paying attention to this aspect can save a lot of grain. According to the principles of nutrition, eating coarser flour and rice is only beneficial and not harmful to people's health. Flour mills and rice mills in various parts of Northeast China have recently revised their output rate indicators; compared with the original planned indicators, the whole year can produce an additional 51,721 tons of grain for the country, which can feed 3 million people for a month. The Grain Bureau of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government has also conducted experiments on increasing the purity and reducing the precision of rice processing, and revised the province's rice processing indicators, with an average increase of 2.5 jin in the processing rate per hundred jin of milled rice; the rice with reduced precision has been tried by staff of various agencies and the effect is very good. The processing section of the Fujian Provincial Grain Bureau also plans to reduce rice milling precision, reduce broken rice rate, and increase rice yield in its affiliated factories, increasing production and saving more than 2 million jin of rice in the fourth quarter of this year. According to research by employees of many local state-owned and private flour and rice milling industries, it is entirely possible to increase rice and flour by one to one and a half jin per hundred jin of rice and wheat on the existing basis while maintaining a certain quality. The key to implementing this measure is to mobilize the masses of workers in processing plants and promote and create advanced experiences. After the Shenyang Flour Mill promoted the experience of "front-end flour extraction," it recently created a new record of 83.9 jin of flour extraction rate. The Harbin Flour Mill adjusted the flour route and improved the silk screen equipment, and can now produce an average of 1.14 jin more flour per hundred jin of wheat. The Wuxi Municipal Food Industry Trade Union recently mobilized the workers in the flour and rice milling industries to study many ways to reduce waste and increase production from aspects such as mastering wheat moisture and the patrol operation system. The creative ability of the masses is unlimited; as long as we explain the importance and necessity of saving grain to the masses, inspire the masses' patriotic enthusiasm for increasing production, and take a very cherish and actively support attitude towards the creative labor of the masses, it is certain that more grain can be saved during processing.
    Farmers should also grind the flour one or two more times when grinding flour, and try to grind it clean. Farmers in Nanyao Village, Chengcheng, Shaanxi calculated that if they grind the flour one more time when grinding, the whole village can produce more than 200 jin of flour a month. This point cannot be ignored in the vast rural areas of the country.
    II. Advocate mixed consumption of coarse grains and fine grains, and eat more coarse grains appropriately. The total output of coarse grains in our country is very large and the yield per unit area is higher than that of fine grains. Many coarse grains also contain very high nutritional value; eating more coarse grains is also beneficial and harmless to people's health. The cooks in many agencies in Beijing have used their brains and made many kinds of delicious and palatable foods from millet flour, corn flour, etc., and most people welcome these foods. In this way, not only the nutritional content of the staple food is improved, but also the money saved can be exchanged for more vegetables, and the nutritional value of a meal is even greater. In the past, some cities and industrial and mining areas consumed too much fine grains. In the future, we should advocate eating more coarse grains so that fine grains and coarse grains can be appropriately allocated throughout the country. To this end, in addition to doing a good job in publicity and explanation to the masses, we must pay special attention to preventing and overcoming the departmentalism of some local cadres, and strictly implement the national unified management and unified allocation of grain.
    III. Strive to reduce the use of grain to feed livestock and poultry. With the improvement of people's production and living standards, the number of draught animals and edible livestock and poultry is increasing day by day, which is undoubtedly a good phenomenon. We cannot advocate feeding livestock and poultry less because we want to save grain. In particular, livestock and pigs have a direct and significant effect on improving farming efficiency and increasing fertilizer. We should also advocate raising and breeding as much as possible. However, we should focus on feeding methods and strive to save grain. This is entirely possible. Comrade Ren Guodong, secretary of the CPC Guo Houqi (formerly Zhaoyuan County) Committee in Heilongjiang Province, recently summed up good experiences from the masses in this regard. These experiences in saving grain in raising fat pigs and strong horses have been promoted throughout the banner, and more than 20 million jin of good grain can be saved before the end of this year (see the report published on the second page of this newspaper on October 25). Li Yanshan, a breeder at the Huanggang Special Zone Farm in Hubei, adopted methods such as rowing boats to release ducks and going into the lake with an empty stomach to find food, and raised 450 ducks, saving more than 3,000 jin of grain for the country in a month; on average, each duck also grew from two jin to four jin in this month. In their letter to Chairman Mao before the National Day this year, the farmers of Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, also proposed to implement the method of growing vegetables and raising pigs, plus not distilling wine or boiling sugar, which can save 150,000 jin of rice a year. The masses in various places have many experiences in collecting wild feed for livestock and poultry and feeding pigs with vegetables and raising livestock and poultry very well. As long as we pay attention to advocating, summarizing and promoting them, the masses will be willing to do so. In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives should also pay attention to solving the problem of livestock feed for the masses. Farmers in many places in Hunan are accustomed to feeding pigs with rice. For example, the 70-odd pigs raised by the Zhang Tingda mutual aid group in Liling County require 105 jin of rice per day (the entire group of 64 people only eat 68 jin of rice per day). In some places in Jiangsu, farmers have to use rice to feed pigs due to the lack of feed such as bran. This is a huge loss to the country and the farmers. All localities should pay attention to solving the problem of feed supply from many aspects, and mobilize the masses to use vegetables, potatoes, chaff and wild feed to raise livestock as much as possible.
    IV. Minimize the use of grain for brewing wine and boiling sugar. Using grain to make wine and maltose (malt sugar, etc.) is the most uneconomical principle, which will consume a large part of the grain, and in general, it is not beneficial and even harmful to people's health. Some state-owned monopoly companies in some places simply "complete the task" and promote to the masses "drinking patriotic wine" and "drinking is good for the body." This kind of propaganda is very one-sided and should be corrected. The brewing industry should be strictly controlled; state-operated and controlled wineries should minimize the use of grain and switch to using fruits, potatoes, etc. to brew wine. The state-owned Xin County Winery changed to using distiller's grains to step on noodles, which can save more than 3,000 jin of grain per day. This experience can also be promoted. Eating maltose is not only a waste of grain, but also unsanitary. Some farmers in many places take making or selling maltose as a side business in winter; we should advise them to change to other side businesses that are beneficial to production as much as possible, or concentrate their efforts on winter manure accumulation, land processing, soil improvement, and agricultural construction such as farmland water conservancy. Farmers in many places in central and southern China have the habit of steaming wine and making sugar with rice after the autumn harvest. For example, after the autumn harvest this year, 30 of the 34 households in Taohua Village, Pingjiang, Hunan steamed wine, with the least steaming 50 jin and the most steaming 200 jin; 34 farmers in Yongxing Township, Hanshou County steamed 52 vats of wine with seven or eight dan of rice. In this way, a lot of grain is used. We should educate them to gradually switch to using other substitutes to make wine, and save grain to exchange for agricultural tools, fertilizers, livestock, and use it to expand production.
    There are many ways for the masses to save grain and use grain rationally. For example, farmers in Beiyunu Village, Chang'an, Shaanxi plan to change from using millet to make vinegar to using bran, which can save more than 20 shi of grain for the whole village a year; in the past, beans were directly applied to the land, and they plan to squeeze the oil first, use the squeezed residue to feed pigs, and then use pig manure to apply to the land. These are all good ways. We should go deep into the masses, find out more ways, and mobilize the masses to consciously and willingly promote them.
    Some farmers have some misunderstandings about the call to save grain, mistakenly believing that this is to ask everyone to "tighten their belts," "change from eating thick to eating thin," and "not even celebrate festivals"; therefore, they are a little impatient with the call to save grain, and even have resentment. We should explain clearly to the masses that saving is not passively asking everyone to lower their living standards, but to ask everyone to waste as little grain as possible, so that the existing grain can exert its effectiveness to the maximum and most reasonable extent. Some comrades asked for too high and unrealistic demands when mobilizing the masses to make production increase and saving plans, neglecting to think of more ways to increase production and improve grain utilization methods, and isolatedly and simply "deducted" the daily lives of farmers from some minor details, and the political and ideological education work was not enough, which easily made the call for production increase and saving, which was originally beneficial to farmers, rejected by the masses, and led to the bad consequences of being divorced from the masses. In order to mobilize the masses to save grain, some comrades one-sidedly publicized the poor harvests in some areas and exaggerated the disaster situation without any basis, which aroused some farmers' anxiety and hoarding of grain, which made it impossible to effectively use the grain; in addition, the farmers' storage conditions were not good, which would also suffer a lot of losses. The reason for these deviations is that these comrades lack a correct understanding of the significance and essence of our current saving of grain; they mistakenly believe that saving grain is because of poor harvests and is an "expedient measure," and have not recognized that this is a long-term and fundamental policy of our national economic construction, in order to concentrate our efforts to develop the national industry and steadily improve the living standards of the entire people.
    With the strong support of the state, the production enthusiasm of the working farmers in our country and the entire agricultural productivity are constantly developing; although it has suffered from various natural disasters this year, the national grain output is still not lower than last year's level, and many areas have also achieved gratifying harvests. All measures of our country are to ensure that the material and cultural living standards of the people are continuously improved on the basis of continuous increase in production. Requiring saving grain is to require us to use grain as appropriately as possible; it is conducive to supporting national industrial construction and improving people's health. Doing so is of great benefit to the overall national economic construction and the long-term interests of the people across the country, and it is also beneficial to the current interests of farmers. The more grain the farmers save, the more they can expand investment in agricultural production; the more grain they can harvest, and the more they can improve their lives. As long as we explain these principles to the masses of farmers in combination with practical examples, and concentrate the methods of rational use of grain and saving grain from the masses and promote them, the masses will be willing to accept them. Employees of grain management departments and grain processing departments and the broad masses of farmers, every grain consumer in the country, we must work together, give play to our creativity, and strive for rational use of grain, support national construction, and improve people's health!

    最合理最有效地使用我们的粮食
    燕凌
    我们的国家经济建设正以我国历史上前所未有的规模和速度前进着。在一个相当长的期间，粮食增长的速度是赶不上国家和人民对粮食的需求的。但是，就我们整个国家的粮食情况来看，只要把粮食运用得当，力求减少浪费，我们在前进中所碰到的这个困难是完全可以克服的。
    要使粮食的增加能够逐步地和整个经济建设的发展和人民生活的提高相适应，最根本的办法自然是把农业生产逐步地放在机械化和集体化的基础上。但是，这不是很快就能够实现的，必须一步一步地走。除了在现有的基础上稳步发展农业生产互助合作组织、改进农具和农业技术以增加粮食产量之外，当前我们必须特别注意减少粮食的浪费。除了田间和场上细收细打，运粮过程中力求减少损失和入仓后加强粮食保管工作以外，在粮食使用方面还必须合乎“物尽其用”的原则。
    在粮食使用问题上，有以下几个方面应当注意：
    一、要提高粮食加工纯度、减低粮食加工精度。能在这方面加以注意，就能够节约大量的粮食。根据营养学的原理，吃粗一些的面粉、大米，对人们的健康是只有好处、绝无害处的。东北各地制粉厂制米厂最近重新修订了出品率指标；和原来的计划指标相比较，全年可为国家多产五万一千七百二十一吨粮食，可供三百万人吃一个月。四川省人民政府粮食厅也作了稻谷加工提高纯度降低精度的试验，修订了全省大米加工指标，平均每百斤上熟米加工成率提高二斤半；降低精度以后的大米经各机关人员试用，效果很好。福建省粮食厅加工科也计划在所属各厂降低碾米精度，减低出碎率，提高出米率，在今年第四季度增产节约大米二百多万斤。据许多地方公私营面粉和碾米工业职工研究，在现有基础上每百斤稻麦增多大米、面粉一斤到一斤半而又能保持一定的质量是完全可能的。实行这一项办法的关键是发动加工厂的职工群众，推广和创造先进经验。沈阳制粉厂推广了“前路出粉”的经验后，最近已创造了出粉率八十三点九斤的新纪录。哈尔滨制粉厂调整了粉路、改进了筛绢设备后，平均每百斤小麦可以多出一点一四斤面粉。无锡市食品工业工会最近先后发动面粉、碾米两业职工，从掌握小麦水分和巡回操作制度等方面研究出了许多减少浪费增加产品的办法。群众的创造能力是无限的；只要我们把节约粮食的重要性和必要性向群众讲明白，把群众的爱国增产的热情鼓舞起来，对于群众的创造性的劳动采取十分珍视和积极支持的态度，在加工过程中节约更多的粮食是一定能够做到的。
    农民们在磨面时也应该多磨一两遍，尽量磨净，陕西澄城南窑村农民计算：磨面的时候都多磨一遍，全村一个月就能多出二百来斤面。全国农村这么广大，这一点也是不可忽视的。
    二、要提倡杂粮、细粮混食，适当多吃杂粮。我国杂粮总产量很多而且单位面积产量比细粮高，许多杂粮中所含的有营养价值的成分也是很高的；多吃杂粮，对人民的健康也是有益无害的。北京好些机关的炊事员同志，开动了脑筋，用小米面、玉米面等做出了很多种味美适口的食物，大部分人对这些食物都很欢迎。这样，不但提高了主食品的营养成分，还可以把省下的钱换更多的菜，一顿饭的营养价值就更大了。过去有些城市和工矿区食用细粮过多，今后应提倡多吃一些杂粮，使全国各地的细粮、杂粮能够适当地调配。为此，除了向群众做好宣传解释工作之外，还要特别注意防止和克服某些地方某些干部的本位主义的思想作风，严格执行全国粮食统一管理、统一调剂的规定。
    三、要力求减少用粮食喂牲畜、家禽。随着人民的生产和生活水平的提高，役用牲畜和食用的家畜、家禽的数量日益增多，这无疑是一种好的现象，我们不能因为要节约粮食就提倡少喂牲口和家畜、家禽。特别是牲畜和猪，对于提高耕作效率和增加肥料有直接的重大作用，我们还应当提倡尽可能多饲养、多繁殖。不过，我们应当从饲养方法上着眼，力求节约粮食。这是完全可以办到的。中共黑龙江省郭后旗（原肇源县）委员会书记任国栋同志最近在这方面已经从群众中总结出来了好的经验。在全旗推广了这些在饲养肥猪壮马中节省粮食的经验，今年年底以前就可以节省二千多万斤好粮食（见本报十月二十五日第二版登载的消息）。湖北黄冈专区农场饲养员李炎山采用划船放鸭子，空着肚子下湖寻食等办法，养了四百五十只鸭子，一个月为国家节省了三千多斤谷子；平均每个鸭子在这一个多月中还都由两斤重长到了四斤重。湖南省湘潭县韶山乡农民在今年国庆节前夕写给毛主席的信中，也曾提出要实行种菜养猪的办法，加上不蒸酒、不熬糖，一年可以节约十五万斤稻谷。各地群众都有许多为家畜家禽采集野生饲料和用菜喂猪而且把畜禽养得很好的经验，只要注意提倡，加以总结和推广，群众是会乐意这样做的。此外，供销合作社也应注意为群众解决家畜饲料问题。湖南很多地方农民习惯用大米喂猪。如醴陵县张庭达互助组各户养猪七十多头，每天要用米一百零五斤（全组六十四口人每天才吃米六十八斤）。江苏有些地方因缺乏麸皮等饲料，农民也不得不用大米喂猪。这对国家对农民都是巨大的损失。各地都应注意从多方面解决饲料供应问题，并发动群众尽量采用菜类、薯类、秕谷和野生饲料饲养家畜。
    四、要尽量少用粮食酿酒、熬糖。用粮食做酒、做饴糖（麦芽糖之类），是最不合乎节约的原则的，这将用掉很大一部分粮食，而一般地说对于人们的健康是没有什么益处、甚至是有害处的。某些地方的国营专卖公司单纯为了“完成任务”，向群众宣传“喝爱国酒”“喝酒对身体有好处”，这种宣传有很大的片面性，应当加以纠正。对于酿酒业应当严格加以管制；国家经营和控制的酒厂，应尽量少用粮食而改用果类、薯类等酿酒。国营忻县酒厂改用酒糟踩面，每天可节约粮食三千多斤，这个经验也是可以推广的。食用饴糖不但浪费粮食，而且是不卫生的。许多地方有些农民冬季以制造或贩卖饴糖为副业；我们应劝告他们尽可能改营其他有益于生产的副业，或集中力量用于冬季积肥、土地加工、土壤改良、兴修农田水利等农业建设。中南、西南很多地方的农民有在秋收以后自己用稻谷蒸酒、做糖的习惯，如今年秋后湖南平江桃花村三十四户就有三十户蒸了酒，最少的蒸了五十斤，最多的蒸了二百斤；汉寿县永兴乡有三十四户农民用七八石大米蒸了五十二缸酒。这样，就用掉大量粮食。我们应教育他们逐步改用其它代用品制酒，把粮食节约下来换取农具、肥料、牲畜，用到扩大生产的地方。
    群众中间节省粮食、合理使用粮食的办法是很多的。像陕西长安北玉女村农民打算把过去用小米做醋的改用麸皮做，全村一年可以省下二十多石粮食；过去用豆子直接上地的，打算先榨了油，用榨剩的渣喂猪，然后再用猪粪上地。这都是些好办法。我们应当深入群众，把更多的办法找出来，发动群众自觉自愿地推行。
    有些农民对于节约粮食的号召有一些误解，误认为这就是要大家“紧腰”“该吃稠的改成吃稀的”“该过个节日也不要过了”；因此，对节约粮食的号召有些不耐烦，甚至发生了反感。我们应当向群众解释清楚，节约并不是消极地要求大家降低生活标准，而是要求大家尽量少糟损粮食，使现有的粮食能够最大限度地最合理地发挥效用。有些同志在发动群众订增产节约计划时要求过高，不切实际，忽略了从增加生产和改进粮食利用方法方面更多想办法，孤立地单纯地从一些细枝末节上去“扣”农民的日常生活，加以政治思想教育工作做得不够，也易使本来对农民有好处的增产节约的号召反为群众所厌弃，反而导致脱离群众的恶果。有些同志为了动员群众节约粮食，片面地宣传某些地区的歉收，毫无根据地夸大灾情，反而惹得一些农民情绪不安，囤积粮食，更使粮食不能有效地利用；加以农民的储藏条件不好，这样还会遭受大量的损失。发生这些偏向的原因，乃是这些同志对于当前我们节约粮食的意义和实质缺乏正确的认识；他们误认为要节约粮食是因为歉收了，是“权宜之计”，而没有认清这乃是我们国家经济建设的长远的根本的方针，是为了集中力量发展国家工业和稳步提高全体人民生活水平。
    在国家的大力支援下，我国劳动农民的生产积极性和整个农业生产力都在不断发展；今年虽然受了各种自然灾害的袭击，全国的粮食产量仍然不低于去年的水平，许多地区还得到了可喜的丰收。我们国家的一切措施，都是为了保证在不断增加生产的基础上不断提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。要求节约粮食，是要求我们把粮食尽可能最适当地加以利用；既利于支援国家工业建设，又利于改善人民的健康状况。这样做，对于整个国家经济建设和全国人民的长远利益是有极大好处的，对于农民当前的利益也是有好处的。农民节余的粮食越多，越能扩大农业生产的投资；越能收获更多的粮食，也越能使自己的生活改善。我们只要把这些道理结合实际的事例向农民群众讲明白，把合理利用粮食节约粮食的办法从群众中集中起来加以推广，群众是会愿意接受的。粮食管理部门、粮食加工部门的职工和广大农民群众，全国每一个粮食消费者，我们要同心协力，发挥创造性，为合理利用粮食、支援国家建设、改进人民健康状况而斗争！
