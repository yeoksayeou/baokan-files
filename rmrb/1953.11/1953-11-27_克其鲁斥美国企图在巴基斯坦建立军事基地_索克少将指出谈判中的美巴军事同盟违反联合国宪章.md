Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 24th. According to TASS, Dr. Keichloo, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, delivered a speech to a crowd of 10,000 people in Amritsar. In his speech, he denounced the aggressive policies of imperialist countries attempting to enslave other nations. He severely criticized the policies of the United States, and condemned the United States for its efforts to establish its own military bases in Pakistan and Kashmir.

Dr. Keichloo called on people of all political persuasions in India to participate in the peace movement, saying that this movement is a forum for all who are determined to serve their nation and the cause of peace.

Referring to his impressions of visiting the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, Dr. Keichloo said that both countries are engaged in constructive labor and have achieved great successes. He said that both the Soviet Union and China are firmly opposed to war.
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th. According to TASS, Delhi. Major General Sok, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, held a press conference in Delhi on the 19th, and spoke on the issues of lasting peace, the Korean question, and the US-Pakistan military alliance under negotiation.

Major General Sok said, "The poverty of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America remains a very important issue for the fate of the world. To solve these problems, peace is necessary." Sok said, "Taking India as an example, our living conditions are extremely difficult and impoverished, a situation caused by over two hundred years of ruthless colonial exploitation." Sok pointed out that to improve the living conditions of the people, we must achieve lasting peace.

Referring to the Korean question, Major General Sok called on everyone to remain vigilant. He said, "Intentions to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement have occurred in the past and are occurring now. A political conference of the relevant members should still be convened to ensure peace in Asia and the world. Everyone in India who has no malice agrees that India should participate in the political conference."

Major General Sok also pointed out that "The People's Republic of China should obtain its legitimate position in the Security Council. This is an urgent and vital issue. If a quarter of the world's population is excluded from the United Nations, lasting peace cannot be guaranteed."

Regarding the US-Pakistan military alliance currently under negotiation, Sok pointed out, "Because Pakistan and the United States are currently negotiating the signing of a military treaty, it is essential that the United Nations act again in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, and abide by the provisions and spirit of the Charter. Any such treaty is a direct violation of the principles and spirit of the United Nations Charter. Any such treaty will push the Cold War further towards us, and therefore we should firmly support our government's efforts to guide the United Nations to truly perform its functions."

Major General Sok also spoke about his impressions of visiting the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, saying, "The sincere desire for peace in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is particularly exciting for us."

    克其鲁斥美国企图在巴基斯坦建立军事基地
    索克少将指出谈判中的美巴军事同盟违反联合国宪章
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社德里二十四日讯：全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士在阿姆利则的一万人大会上发表演说。他在演说中斥责帝国主义国家企图奴役其他国家的侵略政策。他严厉指责美国的政策，并斥责美国竭力企图在巴基斯坦和克什米尔建立自己的军事基地。
    克其鲁博士号召印度各种政治信仰的人参加保卫和平运动，他说这一运动是一切有志为自己的民族与和平事业服务的人们的讲坛。
    克其鲁博士在谈到访问苏联和中华人民共和国的印象时说：这两个国家都在从事建设性劳动，而且取得了巨大的成就。他说：无论苏联和中国都是坚决反对战争的。
   【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社德里讯：全印和平理事会副主席索克少将十九日在德里举行记者招待会，对于持久和平问题、朝鲜问题及美国与巴基斯坦谈判军事同盟等问题发表谈话。
    索克少将说：“亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的贫困，仍然是对世界的命运十分重要的问题。要解决这些问题必须要和平。”索克说：“以印度为例来说，我们的生活条件异常艰苦和穷困，这种情形是二百余年来无情的殖民地剥削所造成的。”索克指出：要改善人民的生活条件，我们就要取得持久和平。
    索克少将谈到朝鲜问题时，号召大家要保持警惕。他说：“破坏朝鲜停战协定的意图过去和现在都在发生，一定成员的政治会议仍然应该召开，以保证亚洲和世界的和平。一切对印度没有恶意的人都同意，印度应该参加政治会议。”
    索克少将并指出：“中华人民共和国应该在安全理事会中取得合法地位，这是一个迫切而紧要的问题。如果世界上四分之一的人口被摈斥在联合国之外，持久和平就不能得到保证。”
    对于正在谈判中的美巴军事同盟，索克指出：“由于现在巴基斯坦与美国正在谈判签订军事条约，所以十分必要使联合国重新本着联合国宪章行事，遵守宪章的条文和精神。任何类似的条约都是直接违反联合国宪章的原则和精神的。任何类似的条约都会把冷战向我们推进一步，因而我们应该坚决地支持我们的政府在导使联合国去真正执行自己的职能方面的努力。”
    索克少将并谈到他访问苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的印象，他说：“苏联和各人民民主国家真诚地希望和平，这是使我们特别兴奋的。”
