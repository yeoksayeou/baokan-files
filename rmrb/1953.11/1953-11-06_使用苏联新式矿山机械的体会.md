 Experiences in Using New Soviet Mining Machinery
 Fuxin Mining Bureau, Haizhou Mine
    In the process of development and construction, the Fuxin Open-Pit Coal Mine received tremendous assistance from the Soviet Union. It successively received many of the latest types of machinery shipped from the Soviet Union, including electric shovels, electric locomotives, and dump trucks. Since the installation of the first electric shovel in April 1951, we have overcome many ideological obstacles and technical difficulties in the installation, use, and maintenance of these machines. After repeated education from the leadership and guidance from Soviet experts, we have strengthened our confidence in using Soviet machinery and have gone from being unfamiliar to skilled, highly maximizing the efficiency of the machinery.

    In the process of learning and mastering new Soviet machinery, we have the following main experiences and gains:

    First, through education based on concrete facts, we established the correct thinking of learning from advanced Soviet experience. In the past, the workers of the Fuxin Coal Mine mostly used Japanese machinery, and the technicians mostly learned a set of British and American technical formulas. They did not have a correct understanding of advanced Soviet technology. For example, the Soviet machinery was all welded together, without rivets, and many people thought it was not strong and would fall apart with a single bump. In response to these situations, the leadership repeatedly carried out education, explaining that Soviet science was the most advanced and that if we were not using it well, it was because our technical level was low and we were not skilled in operation, and that we should mobilize everyone to find solutions. Later, we organized discussions and focused on cultivating activists and excellent groups, organized the study of blueprints, and improved everyone's technical level from a theoretical perspective. Soviet experts also came to Fuxin to personally instruct on operation. This gradually dispelled everyone's empiricism and conservative thinking, and the efficiency of the electric shovel increased from about 18,000 cubic meters per day to 28,000 cubic meters. The efficiency of the locomotive increased from pulling seven cars per train to eleven, and the workers' income also increased accordingly. Through these concrete facts, everyone's perception of the new machinery was changed, and they believed that Soviet machinery was indeed much better than the products of Japan, Britain, and the United States, laying the groundwork for the greater use of Soviet machinery and the learning of Soviet experience in the future.

    Second, we overfulfilled the state's tasks and cultivated a large number of technical cadres and skilled workers who can use modern machinery in our work. The mechanization of the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine has enabled us to regularly overfulfill our plans. Especially in the second half of 1952, due to some external reasons, production would generally be affected. However, because we were proficient in the operation of the machinery, we not only did not reduce efficiency, but actually increased it. For example, the old electric shovel's loading efficiency averaged 55 minutes to load a train (11 cars), while the new electric shovel only took 46 minutes, an efficiency increase of 16.4%. The old dump truck took 45 minutes to dump a train, while the new dump truck only took 12 minutes, and as fast as 3 minutes. Work efficiency has been greatly improved. If we were to extrapolate from this, the coal production period of the open-pit coal mine would be delayed by at least one year if we were to use only Japanese machinery. Another major gain from using Soviet machinery is the cultivation of a large number of technical cadres, which is precisely what we lacked. In the past two years, our mine has trained a total of 97 electric shovel drivers, 100 electric train drivers, 58 dispatching personnel, 18 signal personnel, more than 20 electric train repairmen, and some personnel for other types of work.

    Third, for more than a year, we have relied on the wisdom of the broad masses of workers to create many advanced experiences and improve our technical level. In terms of operation, the advanced technical operation methods created by the workers number in the dozens. For example, the group led by driver Song Yongkuan, No. 25, researched and developed a method of first using 45 seconds to one minute to release the train before slowly applying power, so that the train starts smoothly and can prevent uncoupling and top electric accidents. The advanced experience created by the electric shovel is even more numerous, no less than sixty or seventy types. In terms of maintenance and repair, there are also many experiences. For example, at the beginning, the maintenance personnel did not understand the structure of the new machinery, could not find the problems, and could not repair it. Later, we organized study and researched many maintenance and repair methods and systems, and implemented regular maintenance and designated personnel to be responsible. We created flow-line operation methods and the method of pre-inspection, post-repair, and designated personnel for designated shovels. This has enabled us to use it very skillfully and to quickly repair it when it malfunctions, thereby fully maximizing the efficiency of the machinery.

    In use, we have realized that Soviet machinery has the following characteristics: First, all Soviet machinery has extremely thorough safety devices. Second, the quality of the machinery is good and the efficiency is high, exceeding the products of capitalist countries. For example, the second gear wheel on the electric shovel, which bears the most load, had to be replaced at least twice a month on Japanese electric shovels, but the Soviet electric shovel has not been replaced in more than a year. In terms of mechanical efficiency, taking the dump truck as an example, it is more than twice as high as the old truck. Third, Soviet machinery is easy and light to operate. Whether it is a locomotive or an electric shovel, the driver's cab of Soviet machinery is not only beautiful but also comfortable. The surrounding glass windows are very bright, the operating platform is very high, and the signal signs are very clear, so there is no chance of misreading the signal signs during operation. The driver's seat is a spring-loaded leather chair, and there are heating devices on both sides, making the operation extremely easy and flexible.

    Our country is now engaged in planned industrial construction, and many factories and mines are being equipped with the latest Soviet machinery. Therefore, we must better learn from the Soviet Union's scientific and technological experience and learn to skillfully master Soviet machinery. This is an important link in accelerating the process of our country's construction.

    使用苏联新式矿山机械的体会
    阜新矿务局海州矿
    阜新露天煤矿在开发与建设过程中，获得了苏联的巨大帮助，先后收到由苏联运来的许多最新式的机械，其中包括电铲、电机车、自翻车等。自一九五一年四月安装第一台电铲起到现在，我们在安装、使用检修这些机械的工作中，曾克服了很多思想上的阻碍与技术上的困难，经过领导上反复的教育和苏联专家的指导，才坚定了使用苏联机械的信心，由生疏到熟练，高度发挥了机械的效率。
    我们在学习掌握苏联新机械的过程中，主要有如下几点体会和收获：
    第一，通过具体事实的教育，确立了学习苏联先进经验的正确思想。阜新煤矿的工人同志们过去用的多是日本式机械，技术人员学的多是英、美的一套技术公式，对苏联先进技术没有正确认识。比如苏联的机械结合全是用电焊的，没有铆钉，许多人认为不结实，一碰就得散架子。针对这些情况，领导方面反复地进行教育，说明苏联科学是最先进的，我们使用不好，是技术水平低，操作上不熟练，应该发动大家想办法。以后又组织大家讨论，并重点地培养积极分子和优秀的小组，组织了学习图纸，从理论上来提高大家的技术水平；苏联专家也曾亲自到阜新来指示操作。这样逐步打消了大家的经验主义与保守思想，使电铲效率由日产一万八千立方公尺左右上升到二万八千立方公尺。机车效率由每排车拉七个车提高到十一个，工人的收入也随之增多了。通过这些具体事实，转变了大家对新机械的看法，认为苏联机械的确比日、英、美等国的产品好得多，树立了用新机械的信心，为以后更多的使用苏联机械、学习苏联经验铺平了道路。
    第二，超额完成了国家任务，并在工作中培养了大批能使用现代机械的技术干部与技术工人。阜新露天矿采用机械化的结果，使我们能经常超额完成计划。特别在一九五二年下半年，由于一些外界的原因，在一般情况下，生产都会遭到影响，然而由于熟练了机械的操作，我们不但没有降低效率，反而把效率提高了。例如老电镐的装车效率平均装一排车（一一辆）要五十五分钟，新电镐只要四十六分，效率提高百分之十六点四。老自翻车一排车要四十五分钟才能翻完，新自翻车只要十二分，最快只要三分钟，工作效率大大提高。如以此推测，完全用日式机械来作业，露天煤矿的出煤期间至少要推迟一年以上。使用苏联机械的另一重大收获是培养了大批技术干部，而这正是我们所缺少的。我矿两年来共培养了九十七个电铲司机，一百个电车司机，五十八个调配人员，十八个信号人员，二十多个电车修理工，还有一些其他工种的人员。
    第三，一年多来我们依靠广大职工发挥智慧，创造了许多先进经验，提高了技术水平。在操作方面，工人所创造的先进技术操作方法有好几十种，如二十五号司机宋永宽小组，研究出起车时先用四十五秒至一分钟的时间使列车缓解，再继续慢慢给电，车就启动得稳，能防止折钩与顶电事故。电铲创造的先进经验更多，不下六、七十种。在维护检修方面，也有许多经验，如检修人员开始时不懂新机械构造，找不出毛病，修不好，以后组织学习，研究出了许多检修维护的办法和制度，并实行了定期检修与专人专责，创造了流水作业法及前检后修专人专铲的办法，这样使我们能够很熟练地使用它，也能够在它发生毛病时，迅速加以检修，从而充分发挥了机械效率。
    在使用中我们体会到苏联机械有以下几个特点：第一，所有的苏联机械，安全装置都极周到。第二，机械的质量好，效率高，超过资本主义国家的产品。例如电铲上负荷最多的二车牙轮，日式电铲一月至少要换两次，但苏联电铲一年多还未换过。在机械效率方面，以自翻车为例，比旧车高二倍多。第三，苏联机械操纵灵便、轻巧。苏联机械无论机车或电铲，司机室不但美观，而且舒适，四周的玻璃窗非常明亮，运转台很高，看信号号志都很真切，不会在操作中看错号志。司机座位是有弹簧的皮椅，两侧有暖气装置，操作时也极轻便灵活。
    我国现在正从事有计划的工业建设，许多厂矿正以苏联最新式的机械装备起来，因此我们必须更好地学习苏联的科学技术经验，学会熟练地掌握苏联机械，这是加速我国建设进程的重要一环。
