    To ensure that people throughout the country live better and better lives, we must gradually transform our country into an industrialized nation, and gradually carry out socialist transformation of our agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. To build our country of hundreds of millions of people into a socialist paradise – what a glorious and great undertaking! Those who contribute to this cause will be praised and remembered by the people of the whole country and by future generations. For the sake of industrialization and socialist transformation, workers across the country are putting in their efforts and finding ways to increase production and practice thrift. What should the peasants do? The greatest contribution the peasants can make to the country is to provide the country with grain, cotton, and other agricultural products, especially grain, which is the most important. To make more contributions, it is necessary to produce more grain. In addition to paying a fixed amount of agricultural tax, it is also necessary to sell surplus grain to the state. This is necessary for the country's industrialization. It is also necessary to gradually transform agriculture into a socialist form.

    **To Implement Industrialization, Sell Grain to the State**

    Why is it said that to implement industrialization, it is necessary to sell grain to the state? The reason is very simple: everyone needs to eat. Peasants need to eat, and workers and peasants who produce industrial raw materials (cotton, tobacco, hemp, sugarcane, sugar beets, etc.) also need to eat. Workers and peasants who produce industrial raw materials do not grow grain or lack grain, so they can only rely on the state to supply them. For the state to industrialize, it is also necessary to have a strong army to defend the country. Most of the soldiers also do not farm, and their food must be supplied by the state. For the state to industrialize, there must also be institutions to manage these affairs and schools to train talents. The staff of these institutions and the students need to eat, and naturally, the state must supply them. In addition, the general population in cities and towns across the country, the grain-deficient households in rural areas, and disaster victims must also have someone supply them with grain. No matter where, there cannot be a shortage of grain for even a day; without it, people cannot live. There are almost two hundred million people nationwide who need to buy grain to eat. Private merchants only care about making money and do not care about their survival; only the people's state is responsible to the people. Where does the state get enough grain to feed so many people? The agricultural tax paid by the peasants alone is not enough to cover expenses. To take care of the interests of the peasants, the state cannot demand too much agricultural tax from them. It is for this reason that the state has decided to use money to buy grain from the peasants. It is also for this reason that the peasants should sell their surplus grain to the state.

    **To Implement Socialist Transformation, Sell Grain to the State**

    Why is it said that to implement socialist transformation, it is also necessary to sell grain to the state? Socialism means everyone becoming prosperous together, with no one exploiting anyone else. If people with surplus grain hoard it and do not sell it to the state, or sell it to speculative profiteers, then the peasant brothers in disaster-stricken areas and other people who lack grain will have no grain to eat. In order to survive, they will have to sell land and livestock, borrow money at high interest rates, sell unripe crops, and become hired laborers, subject to exploitation and living a life of poverty and suffering. A few wealthy households will become exploiters. This situation is the opposite of socialism.

    Selling grain to the state is to strike at exploitation. First, profiteers cannot speculate and drive up prices, exploiting workers and peasants; second, the differentiation within the peasantry is reduced, reducing the number of people who get rich by exploitation, making it easier to embark on the socialist road of common prosperity.

    Some people worry: "If I sell my surplus grain to the state, what will I do if I encounter a famine next year?" The state's control of grain is precisely to ensure that everyone in cities and rural areas across the country has food to eat. Our country is so large that if there is no harvest here, there will be a harvest there; not everywhere will be hit by disaster. In the future, every year the state will control all the grain in the country and will never let people in disaster-stricken areas starve to death; nor will it allow grain-deficient households in the countryside to go hungry in the lean months, subject to exploitation by profiteers and usurers. Moreover, the state's control of sufficient grain will enable it to build more water conservancy projects, produce more pesticides, and help peasants reduce disasters; it will also be able to build more railways, manufacture vehicles, and build ships, making it easier to adjust the grain supply in various regions. In this way, the state can gradually reduce the number of disaster-stricken areas and the grain-deficient population; in addition, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement can gradually reduce the number of people subjected to exploitation, until in the future everyone is free from any exploitation.

    Some people have surplus grain and do not sell it; some people even rush to sell cotton, sell fat pigs, and even sell land, exchanging it for grain to hoard, single-mindedly waiting to make a fortune. Let's assume that they can really make this fortune. Think about how this wealth is made? This is exploiting the blood and sweat of the working class and grain-deficient peasant brothers! This is a dead end that cannot and must not be taken. Peasants must not take this road! Peasants learning from speculative private merchants is like sheep worshipping tigers as teachers; there will be no good results.

    If you cannot become wealthy by buying and selling grain or lending money at high interest rates, then how can you become wealthy? Only by diligent production. To seek wealth in production, it is essential to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. The Communist Party calls on peasants to sell grain to the state precisely to lead peasants to avoid evil paths, not to take that dead end that cannot be taken, but to continue to move towards the bright road of collectivization where everyone prospers together.

    **Is Hoarding Grain a Bargain?**

    Putting grain aside and not selling it, waiting for the price to rise before selling; in this way, it seems that you can get some advantage. In fact, such "advantages" cannot and should not be taken.

    Peasants work hard to increase production and harvest a lot of grain, which is originally a contribution to the country and to the people of the whole country. However, if the peasants with surplus grain harvest the grain and hide it at home, refusing to sell it, they will damage the interests of the country and harm the laboring brothers in the cities and the grain-deficient brothers in the countryside. In this way, these originally meritorious peasants will cancel out their merits with one stroke of the pen; everyone will not only not say that they have made a contribution, but will also blame them. What glory is there in this for them? Furthermore, if many people do not have enough to eat or are not well-fed, the state cannot be properly built, and the peasants cannot enjoy future happiness. By being greedy for a little immediate benefit (in fact, hoarding grain may not even be beneficial to the peasants in the short term), they will lose the future benefits and the benefits for their children and grandchildren. Isn't this a miscalculation?

    Furthermore, peasants who understand things should not hope that grain prices will rise again. Because once grain prices rise, other prices will inevitably rise together, making life difficult for people throughout the country, and most peasants will inevitably suffer a great loss in this. Once prices fluctuate, profiteers will take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters and ruthlessly exploit everyone. Everyone hoards grain and refuses to sell, forcing up grain prices. Who is happy in the end? Only profiteers. Who benefits in the end? Only profiteers. By tossing back and forth, it is always the speculative private merchants who profit, and it is always the working masses who suffer. Hasn't everyone suffered such losses before? You sold a large fat pig at the first fair, and you couldn't even buy a small piglet with the money at the second fair. How heartbreaking that time was! We cannot let those days come again.

    **Is Selling Grain to the State a Loss?**

    Some people say: "If I sell grain to the state, what will I do if I don't have enough to eat myself?" The state does not buy the grain that the peasants keep for their own consumption; the grain that the state wants to buy is the grain that the peasants are going to sell sooner or later anyway. The price the state buys grain at is also the fairest, and will never let the peasants lose money. Peasants who sell grain to the state are both making a contribution and getting money.

    After the state buys grain, it will continue to send the things that the peasants need to the countryside, so that the peasants can buy these things, improve production, and improve their lives. Our country will need more grain, cotton, and oil crops (peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, flaxseed), and livestock (cattle, horses, donkeys, sheep, pigs, chickens) next year, so peasants should first use the money to add farm tools, fertilizer, and livestock to develop production. Increasing production can not only increase individual income, but also increase state income, which is truly beneficial to both the public and the private sectors.

    When the state has enough grain and builds up industry smoothly, the things supplied to the peasants will be more and cheaper. Such things happen everywhere. Everyone should calculate for themselves and see that selling grain to the state to support industrial construction is only beneficial to the peasants and will never be a loss.

    Should rich peasants also sell their surplus grain to the state? Of course. Since the state allows rich peasants to exist and protects their legitimate interests, they should also fulfill their due obligations to the state. If rich peasants are patriotic, it will also benefit themselves. If rich peasants spread rumors and make trouble during the state's grain purchase, it will not benefit themselves either.

    **What is Wrong with Selling Grain to Private Merchants?**

    People have given the large profiteers who speculate in grain a name called "Grain Tigers"; this name is very appropriate. Profiteers do not care about the life or death of the people in order to make money for themselves. If we sell grain to private merchants, it is like raising tigers. They will stop you on the road, or sneak into the village secretly, use various relationships to find you, and put on a fake smile to trick you into selling grain to them; they will also say that the price they give you per catty of grain is higher than the listed price. Do not be fooled by them! If we are fooled by these "smiling tigers", are greedy for a little profit, and sell a lot of grain to them, the country will not be peaceful, and the peasants will suffer a great loss in the future! Why are private merchants willing to offer high prices? Isn't it still this trick: buy at a high price today, sell at a higher price tomorrow; buy at a high price here, sell at a higher price there. They are the ones who fear the world is not in chaos; sometimes they "do it even if they don't make money," which is in order to make more money, to disrupt the entire market, and to raise prices, so that they can take the opportunity to rob the wealth of the working people even more.

    The peasants have suffered enough from grain merchants in the past. "Cheap grain hurts farmers, prices fall in autumn and rise in spring, large measures in and small measures out, using large scale weights, suppressing the grade of peasants' grain," etc., are all their tricks. Dai Shengji, a peasant in Yongxiu County, Jiangxi, said: "Before liberation, one year after the autumn harvest, the landlord forced him to repay his debts; at that time, the grain merchant took the opportunity to lower the price of grain, and he had to painfully sell one dan of grain for one silver dollar to repay the debt; the following spring, the whole family ran out of grain, but the landlord and the grain merchant raised the price of grain to four silver dollars per dan." Which peasant in that place has not encountered such a thing? Last year, Xia County, Shanxi, was hit by a disaster, and the market price of wheat per catty was originally 1,400 yuan, but later the private merchants raised the price to 2,200 yuan in a few days. Fortunately, the government transferred a lot of grain from other provinces, which lowered the price of grain to 1,160 yuan and helped everyone overcome the difficulties. Such things happen everywhere. Everyone sees that grain merchants have always been tricking peasants like this, how can they still have good intentions now? Can we be greedy for small profits and harm ourselves? Can we let grain merchants harm our grain-deficient peasant brothers in order to get a little advantage for ourselves? If we here are hit by a disaster and lack grain, the peasant brothers in other places will sell grain to the state to support us. Can we now ignore the life and death of the grain-deficient peasant brothers in other places?

    In short, everyone must recognize that the peasants' selling grain to the state is not an ordinary buying and selling relationship. You must not think like this: "The grain is harvested by me, it's up to me whether I sell it or not; storing grain or storing money is the same anyway." "No matter if it's a private merchant or a cooperative, a purchasing station, I'll sell it to whoever offers the highest price, it's the same to me anyway." No, this is very different. Hoarding grain and not selling it or selling it to private merchants is destroying national construction, destroying the country's general line, it is to make most people poor and a very few people rich; selling grain to the state is loving the country, it is helping the great cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, it is supporting the country's general line. Patriotic peasants must sell grain to the state.

    实行总路线要把粮食卖给国家
    燕凌
    要想全国人民都过越来越好的日子，就要一步一步地把我们的国家变成个工业化的国家，就要一步一步地对我们的农业、手工业、私营工商业进行社会主义改造。把我们这个几万万人口的国家建设成一个社会主义的乐园，这是多么光荣、多么伟大的事业！在这个事业里有功劳的，全国人民和后世子孙都会赞美他们、纪念他们。为了工业化和社会主义改造，全国工人们都在出力气，想办法增产节约；农民该做些什么呢？农民对国家的最大的功劳，就是供给国家粮食、棉花和其他农产品，特别是粮食最重要。要多立功劳，就要多多生产粮食，除了缴有一定数目的公粮以外，还要把余粮卖给国家。为了国家工业化，就必须这样做。为了把农业一步一步地改造成社会主义的样子，也必须这样做。
    要实行工业化就要把粮食卖给国家
    为什么说要实行工业化就要把粮食卖给国家呢？道理很简单：人都要吃饭，农民不吃饭不行，工人和生产工业原料（棉花、烟叶、麻、甘蔗、糖萝卜等等）的农民不吃饭也不行。工人和生产工业原料的农民是不种粮食或者缺少粮食的，这就只有靠国家供给他们了。国家要工业化，没有强大的军队保卫国家也不行。军人们大部分也是不种地的，他们吃饭也得由国家供给。国家要工业化，还得有管理这些事情的机关，还得有训练人才的学校；机关人员和学生们要吃饭，自然也得国家供给。此外，全国大小城镇里的一般人民，农村里的缺粮户和灾民，也得有人把粮食供给他们。无论什么地方，一天也不能缺粮食，缺了就不能过日子。这些要买粮吃的人，全国合共差不多有两万万。私商是只顾自己挣钱，不管他们的死活的，只有人民的国家才对人民负责任。国家从哪里弄到够这样多人吃的粮食呢？单是农民交的公粮是不够开销的；为了照顾农民的利益，国家不能向农民要公粮太多。就是这个缘故，国家才决定要拿钱向农民买粮食。也就是这个缘故，农民应该把余粮卖给国家。
    要实行社会主义改造就要把粮食卖给国家
    为什么说要实行社会主义改造也要把粮食卖给国家呢？社会主义就是大家一同富裕，谁也不剥削谁。如果有余粮的人都把粮食囤起来不卖给国家，或者卖给投机的奸商，那些受了灾的地方的农民弟兄和别的缺粮的人就会没有粮食吃，为了活命就要卖地卖牲口、借高利贷、卖青苗、当雇工，受人剥削，就要过穷苦受罪的日子；少数富户就变成了剥削者。这个光景，和社会主义恰恰相反。
    把粮食卖给国家，就是打击剥削。一来奸商不可能投机倒把，抬高物价，剥削工人农民；二来农民内部也减少了分化，减少了靠剥削发财的人，好走上一同富裕的社会主义道路。
    有人担心：“把余粮卖给国家，我自己明年遭到荒年怎么办？”国家掌握粮食，正是为了保障全国城市、农村人人都有饭吃。我们的国家这么大，这里不收那里收，不会到处都遭灾。以后每年国家把全国的粮食都掌握住，就决不会让受灾地区的人饿死；也不让乡下缺粮户在青黄不接的时候挨饿，受奸商和放高利贷的人剥削。况且，国家掌握了足够的粮食，就能多修水利、多造杀虫药，帮助农民减少灾害；也能更多地修铁路、造车、造船，更便利调剂各地的粮食。这样，国家就能逐渐减少受灾的地方和缺粮的人口；再加上开展互助合作运动，就可以逐渐减少受剥削的人，直到将来使每个人都不受一点剥削。
    有些人有余粮不卖，有些人还抢着卖棉花、卖肥猪甚至卖土地，换成粮食囤起来，一心等着发大财。就假定他们真能发得成这个财吧，大家想一想这财是怎样发起来的呢？这就是剥削工人阶级和缺粮的农民弟兄的血汗啊！这是一条走不通也走不得的死路，农民们千万不能走这条路！农民向投机私商学样子，等于绵羊向老虎拜老师，不会有好结果的。
    不能靠买卖粮食、放高利贷富裕，那么靠什么富裕起来呢？只有靠勤劳生产。要在生产中求富裕，非走互助合作的路不可。共产党号召农民把粮食卖给国家，正是为了领着农民避开邪路，不走那走不通的死胡同，而要一直走到大家一同富裕的合作化的光明大路上去。
    把粮食囤起来，是不是沾便宜
    把粮食放着不卖，等价钱高了再卖；这样，好像自己可以沾些便宜。其实，这样的“便宜”是沾不得也沾不上的。
    农民努力增加生产，打下了很多粮食，本来是对国家，对全国人民有功的。可是，要是有余粮的农民都把粮食打下来就往家里一藏，不肯出卖，就把国家的利益损害了，也把城里的劳动弟兄和乡下缺粮的弟兄们坑害了。这样，这些原来是有功劳的农民就把自己的功劳一笔勾销了；大家不唯不说他们有功劳，还都要责备他们。这对他们自己有什么光彩呢？再说，弄得好多人没饭吃或者吃不饱，国家就不能好好建设，农民也就不能享受将来的幸福。这样贪图眼前一点利益（其实囤粮不卖对农民眼前也未必就有好处），就把往后的利益和子子孙孙的利益都丢掉了，这不是把账算错了吗？
    再说，懂得事理的农民也不应该希望粮价再涨。因为粮价一涨，旁的物价也势必一齐要跟着涨，弄得全国人民都不好过日子，大多数农民在这里头也非吃大亏不可。物价一波动，奸商们就会趁机混水摸鱼，狠命剥削大家。大家都囤粮不卖，逼高粮价，到底谁高兴呢？只有奸商；到底谁沾光呢？只有奸商。倒腾过来倒腾过去，得利的总是投机私商，吃亏的总是劳动群众。这样的亏，大家几年以前不是没有吃过的。头一集卖一头大肥猪，第二集拿这钱还不够买一个小猪崽子。那时光多叫人心痛啊！可不能让那样的日子再来了。
    把粮食卖给国家、是不是吃亏
    有人说：“把粮食卖给国家，自己不够吃怎么办呢？”国家并不买农民自己留着吃的粮食；国家要买的粮食，是农民本来迟早总要卖的。国家买粮食，价钱也是最公平的，决不会让农民不够本。农民把粮食卖给国家，是既立了功，又得了钱的。
    国家买了粮食，还要把农民需要的东西陆续送到乡下来，使农民能买到这些东西，改进生产，改善生活。我们的国家明年需要更多的粮食、棉花、油料（花生、芝麻、菜子、胡麻子）、牲畜（牛、马、驴、羊、猪、鸡），所以农民有了钱，首先应当拿来添置农具、肥料和牲畜，发展生产。增加了生产，既能增加个人的收入，也能增加国家的收入，真正是公私两利。
    国家有了足够的粮食，把工业顺顺当当地建设起来，供给农民用的东西就会更多更便宜。这样的事情到处都有；大家亲自算一下看，就知道把粮食卖给国家支援工业建设对农民是只有好处、决不会吃亏的。
    富农要不要把余粮卖给国家呢？当然也要。国家既允许富农存在并且保护他们的合法的利益，他们就也应该对国家尽应尽的义务。富农如果爱国，那对他们自己也有好处，富农如果在国家购粮的时候造谣生事，那对他们自己也不会有好处。
    把粮食卖给私商有什么不好
    人们给倒腾粮食的大奸商起了一个名字，叫“粮老虎”；这名字起得真对。奸商为了自己发财是不顾人民死活的。我们如果把粮食卖给私商，就等于养老虎。他在半路上拦住你，或者鬼鬼祟祟地溜到村子里，利用种种关系找到你，摆出一付皮笑肉不笑的样子来，骗你把粮食卖给他；还说每斤粮食给你的价钱要比牌价高。千万不要上他们的当！如果我们上了这些“笑面虎”的当，贪一点小利，把许多粮食卖到他们手里，国家就不得太平，农民以后不知要吃多大亏！私商为什么肯出高价呢？还不是这一套：今天高价买，明天用更高的价钱卖；在这里高价买，到那里用更高的价钱卖。他们是唯恐天下不乱的；有时候“不挣钱也干”，那是为了挣更多的钱，是为了把整个市场弄乱，把物价抬高，他们好趁机会更多地抢夺劳动人民的财富。
    农民们过去吃粮商的亏也吃够了。谷贱伤农、秋跌春涨、大斗进小斗出、用大秤锤、压低农民的粮食的等级等等，都是他们搞的鬼把戏。江西永修县农民戴圣吉说：“解放前有一年秋收后，地主逼着讨债；那时粮商趁机压低谷价，只好忍痛一担谷子卖一块银元还了债；第二年春天，一家大小断了粮，可是地主和粮商却把谷子涨到了四块银元一担。”这样的事，那个地方的农民没遭到过？去年山西夏县受了灾，集上每斤小麦市价原先是一千四百元，后来私商不几天把价钱抬到二千二百元。幸亏政府从外省调来许多粮食，才把粮价压低到一千一百六十元，帮助大家渡过了困难。这样的事，也是随处都有的。大家看，粮商向来就都是这样捉弄农民的，现在他们还能安什么好心？我们能贪小利害自己吗？能为了自己沾一点小便宜让粮商去苦害缺粮的农民弟兄吗？我们这里受了灾缺了粮，别的地方的农民弟兄就卖给国家粮食支援我们，现在我们能不顾别的地方缺粮的农民弟兄的死活吗？
    总之，大家要认清楚，农民卖粮食给国家，决不是平常的买卖关系。决不能这样想：“粮食是我打的，卖不卖由我；放粮食放钱反正是一样。”“不管是私商或是合作社、收购站，谁出价高我就卖给谁，反正对我都是一样。”不，这可大不一样。囤粮不卖或者卖给私商，就是破坏国家建设，破坏国家的总路线，就是要使大多数人受穷、极少数人发财；把粮食卖给国家，就是爱国，就是帮助社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的伟大事业，就是拥护国家的总路线。爱国的农民一定要把粮食卖给国家。
