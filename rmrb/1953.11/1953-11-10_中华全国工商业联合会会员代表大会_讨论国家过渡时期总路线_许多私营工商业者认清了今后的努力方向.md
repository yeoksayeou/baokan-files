Xinhua News Agency, November 9th: The National Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representative Assembly, after group discussions on the report by Li Weihan, Deputy Director of the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee, has gained a clearer understanding of the general line for the transition period and the future direction of efforts for private industrialists and businessmen. Through enthusiastic discussions, everyone recognized that our country must industrialize, and that industrialization must follow the path of socialist industrialization. The Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate developing industry through the capitalist industrialization path, which involves a minority exploiting the majority. In today's historical conditions, this approach is not viable and leads to a dead end. Many representatives from private industry used their own experiences to illustrate that following the path of socialist industrialization is the only way. They had been running industries for many years, but under the dumping of imperialist goods and the exclusion and oppression of Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, their enterprises were constantly threatened. After liberation, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, i.e., the socialist economy, their enterprises achieved considerable development.

During the group discussions, everyone recognized the great significance of the policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation adopted by the People's Government towards private industry and commerce during the transition period. Many people clearly understood that being utilized by the people and being able to better serve the country is an honor for the industrial and commercial sector. Quite a few representatives cited examples in the discussions, pointing out that there are still many industrialists and businessmen who are seriously engaging in tax evasion, tax avoidance, shoddy workmanship, and resisting state processing orders. If these practices are not stopped, combated, and transformed, it will not be possible to guide these individuals onto this glorious path. Private industrialists and businessmen in the Central and Southern regions proposed that the patriotic attitude of private industrialists and businessmen towards "utilization, restriction, and transformation" should be: "Actively operate to strive for utilization, avoid the 'five poisons' and accept restrictions, and study diligently and welcome transformation." Many representatives felt honored by Li Weihan's statement in his report that a group of advanced elements has already emerged in the industrial and commercial sector and is gradually becoming the backbone for uniting and educating the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen. They expressed their intention to make more contributions to the country and the people to consolidate this honor.

Many representatives used the remarkable achievements of their own enterprises after being transformed into state capitalist enterprises to prove that the state capitalist economy is much better than private capitalism. Guo Dihuo, a representative of private industry, listed the profit and loss situations of 38 private textile factories in Shanghai that were processing orders for the state, illustrating that state capitalist enterprises have more advantages than private capitalism. Among the 38 factories in Shanghai's textile industry, 18 factories had surpluses and 20 had deficits in 1950; 31 factories had surpluses and 7 had deficits in 1951; 35 factories had surpluses and 3 had deficits in 1952; and 37 factories had surpluses and only one small factory had a deficit in 1953. Representatives of private industry such as Liu Hongsheng, Zhou Shutao, Tong Shaosheng, Rong Yiren, and Liu Jingji all used their own experiences or understandings to explain that taking the path of state capitalism is beneficial to both the country and themselves. Some representatives from private industry and commerce in the Central and Southern regions proposed that a positive attitude towards implementing the general line is: obeying the management of the People's Government, obeying the leadership of the state-owned economy, obeying the supervision of the worker masses, actively engaging in legal business operations, and changing the past situation of only seeking profit.

Through discussions, the representatives recognized the bright future and direction of efforts for private industry and commerce. Li Guowei, the current manager of Shenxin No. 4 Textile Company and Fuxin No. 5 Flour Company, used his own personal experience to illustrate the correctness of the general line and the direction of efforts for private industrialists and businessmen. He said: I have been running factories for decades. In the past, I often suffered from the warlords, the Kuomintang bandits, and the local bullies. If I continued to run them, the factories were constantly threatened; if I didn't run them, I was a little reluctant, like an orphan. After liberation, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, the enterprises developed. My own experience and lessons taught me to lean to one side, leaning towards socialism. He also said: My factory used to not only exploit workers but also exploit peasants, such as using large scales to weigh the peasants' cotton. In the future, I must operate well, serve the country and the people more, and I must be worthy of the country and the people. At that time, when socialism is reached and the bourgeoisie is eliminated, I will be happy personally. Gao Zhensheng, a representative of industry and commerce from Hebei Province, said: Now I am no longer confused, and I am clear about taking the socialist road. As long as private industrialists and businessmen accept transformation and actively engage in business operations, they will have a future. Through discussions, I have recognized the future of the motherland, and I am very excited. In the future, I will work hard to improve management and serve the country and the people more.

In the past few days, the participating representatives have been divided into nine special topic groups to discuss some professional and specific issues. Overseas Chinese representatives and ethnic minority representatives were organized for discussions by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government and the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, respectively.

    中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会
    讨论国家过渡时期总路线
    许多私营工商业者认清了今后的努力方向
    【新华社九日讯】中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会，经过分组讨论政务院财政经济委员会李维汉副主任报告后，对过渡时期的总路线和私营工商业者今后努力方向，有了比较明确的认识。经过热烈的讨论，大家认识了：我们的国家必须工业化，而工业化又必须是走社会主义工业化的道路；走资本主义工业化的道路，以少数人剥削大多数人的办法来发展工业，这种办法中国人民是绝不容许的，在今天的历史条件下是走不通的，也是死亡的道路。许多私营工业的代表以自己的亲身体验，说明了走社会主义工业化的道路，是唯一的道路。他们过去办了多少年的工业，但在帝国主义商品倾销和国民党官僚资本的排斥欺压下，弄得企业朝夕不保，解放后，在国营经济即社会主义经济领导下，企业得到了相当发展。
    在小组讨论中，大家认识了在过渡时期人民政府对私营工商业所采取的利用、限制和改造政策的巨大意义。很多人明确了能为人民利用，能更好地为国家服务，这是工商界的光荣。有不少代表在讨论中举例说明目前还有不少工商业者，严重地偷税、漏税、偷工减料、抗拒国家加工订货等，如果不加以制止、斗争和改造，是不能把这些人引上这条光荣的道路。中南区私营工商业者提出了爱国的私营工商业者对待“利用、限制和改造”的积极态度应该是：“积极经营争取利用，不犯五毒接受限制，努力学习欢迎改造”。很多代表认为李维汉副主任在报告中所说的，工商界已经出现了一批先进分子，并逐渐成为团结和教育广大工商业者的骨干这一点，觉得很光荣，他们表示要对国家和人民做出更多的贡献，来巩固这一光荣。
    许多代表以自己企业改变为国家资本主义性质的企业后的显著成效，证明国家资本主义经济，比私人资本主义要好得多。私营工业代表郭棣活列举为国家加工订货的上海私营纺织业企业三十八个工厂的盈亏情形，说明了国家资本主义企业比私人资本主义具备更多的优越性。上海纺织业的三十八个厂子一九五○年有十八个工厂盈余，二十个工厂亏蚀，一九五一年三十一个工厂盈余，七个工厂亏蚀，一九五二年三十五个工厂盈余，三个工厂亏蚀，一九五三年三十七个工厂盈余，仅有一个小厂亏蚀。私营工业的代表刘鸿生、周叔弢、童少生、荣毅仁、刘靖基等许多人都用自己的体会或认识说明走国家资本主义道路，对国家、对自己都有好处。中南私营工商业者中部分代表提出贯彻执行总路线的积极态度是：服从人民政府管理，服从国营经济领导，服从工人群众的监督，积极进行合法经营，改变过去唯利是图的情况。
    经过讨论，代表们认清了私营工商业的光明前途和努力方向。现任申新第四纺织公司、福新第五面粉公司经理李国伟，以自己的亲身体验说明总路线的正确性和私营工商业者自己努力的方向。他说：我办了几十年工厂，过去常受军阀、国民党匪帮、地痞，流氓的气，办吧，工厂朝夕不保，不办，有点舍不得，像孤儿一样。解放后，在国营经济领导下，企业发展了，我自己的经历教训我要一边倒，倒向社会主义。他又说：我的厂，过去不仅剥削过工人，也剥削过农民，如用大秤称农民的棉花等，我今后，一定要好好经营，为国家为人民多服务，一定要对得起国家和人民，那时，到达社会主义，资产阶级消灭了，个人是愉快的。河北省工商业代表高振生说：现在不糊涂了，对走社会主义道路是明确了，只要私营工商业者接受改造，积极经营，自己是有前途的。经过讨论，使我认清了祖国的前途，我非常兴奋，今后我要努力改进经营，为国家和人民多效劳。
    最近几天，与会代表曾分成九个专题小组讨论一些专业性的具体问题。华侨代表和少数民族代表则分别由中央人民政府华侨事务委员会和中央人民政府民族事务委员会组织讨论。
